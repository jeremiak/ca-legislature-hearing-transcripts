00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:15.675
NO THIS IS A BILL THAT REALLY

THROUGH THE USE OF HOME

00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:34.127
MODIFICATIONS.

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:35.929
THAT SIMPLY REDUCE THE RISK OF

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:38.331
FALLING. ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:40.767
EVERY DAY IN CALIFORNIA TURNED

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:42.435
SIXTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE WE ARE

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:44.070
NOW AN AGING STATE.

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:45.939
WHAT IS SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:47.607
A NEGATIVE BIRTH RATE STATE?

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:50.677
AND AS A RESULT -- WE ARE AGING

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:52.278
IS A POPULATION IN NEED TO

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:53.746
ADDRESS SOME OF THE REALITIES

00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:54.848
THAT TAKE PLACE.

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:57.383
AS ONE AGESIN TURN SIXTY FIVE

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.353
YEARS OF AGE.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.322
SENIORS -- ARE MORE LIKELY TO

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:04.057
FALL OBVIOUSLY IN SERIOUSLY

00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:05.425
INJURE THEMSELVES AND LET'S SAY

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:07.327
A TWO YEAR OLD WHO BOUNCES BACK

00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:08.795
AND HAS NO CLUE THAT THEY'VE

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:10.196
JUST HURT THEMSELVES BECAUSE

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:11.097
FRANKLY.

00:02:11.164 --> 00:02:12.265
THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO HURT

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:13.800
THEMSELVES WITH THE FALL THAN

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:15.902
SOMEONE WHO IS AGING AND

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.370
SUFFERING THROUGH THERE.

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:18.805
THE RAVAGERS OR THE THE

00:02:18.872 --> 00:02:20.740
CHALLENGES OF OF THAT AGING

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:24.210
EXPERIENCE. 33% OF ALL FALSE

00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:27.213
AMONG OLDER INDOOR ADULTS

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.414
INVOLVE HAZARDS AT HOME. ONE

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:30.216
THIRD OF THE FALLS IT'S SENIORS

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:32.185
EXPERIENCE IS AS A RESULT OF A

00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:34.287
FALL AT HOME DUE TO THINGS LIKE.

00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:36.856
POOR LIGHTING LOOSE CARPET A

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:38.625
LACK OF SAFETY EQUIPMENT THINGS

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:41.694
LIKE GRAB BARS STAIR RAILS HIGH

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:44.597
TOILETS FOR EXAMPLE.

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:47.233
THEY ARE A PARTICULAR RISK. 80%

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.768
OF THE FALLS HAD HAPPEN TO

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:50.603
INFILTRATE HOME HAPPEN IN THE

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.272
BATHROOM.

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:55.108
SO THIS BILL DOES TWO THINGS TO

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:56.543
HELP SENIORS AND THOSE WITH

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:57.944
DISABILITIES MAKE THEIR HOME

00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:58.878
SAFER.

00:02:58.945 --> 00:02:59.646
AND A PLACE THAT WILL

00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:01.381
ACCOMMODATE THEM FOR YEARS TO

00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:03.016
COME FIRST.

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:04.317
THIS BILL AUTHORIZES THE

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:06.352
DEPARTMENT OF AGING.

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:08.254
THE ISSUE GRANTS TO OUR AREA

00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:11.324
AGENCIES ON AGING. FOR INJURY

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:13.626
PREVENTION SERVICES IN THE HOME

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:15.795
THIS IS THE STATION TIME.

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:17.463
THESE GRANTS CAN BE USED TO MAKE

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.898
IMPROVEMENTS AROUND THE HOME

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:20.199
THINGS THAT I JUST MENTIONED

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:21.768
WHICH ARE CAUSES OF FALSE THINGS

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:23.269
LIKE POOR LIGHTING.

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:25.238
THINGS LIKE ADDING GRAB BARS OR

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:27.640
ROOM -- JUST SIMPLY NAILING DOWN

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:29.409
CARPET THE PEOPLE WOULDN'T

00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:30.743
NECESSARILY THINK TO DO.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.245
SMALL IMPROVEMENTS LIKE THIS

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:33.713
FRANKLY CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.014
BETWEEN.

00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:37.317
OUR AGING IN PLACE AND

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:40.053
EXPERIENCING A POTENTIAL FUTURE

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:41.754
BEING INSTITUTIONALIZED.

00:03:41.821 --> 00:03:43.590
WE HAVE WE DO NOT HAVE ADEQUATE

00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:45.258
HOME FACILITIES NOW FOR OUR

00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:46.626
AGING POPULATION.

00:03:46.693 --> 00:03:48.227
SO IT BEHOOVES US TO DO

00:03:48.294 --> 00:03:50.196
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ASSIST

00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:51.898
SENIORS SO THAT THEY CAN AGE AN

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:53.399
AGE WITH DIGNITY IN THEIR OWN

00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:54.734
HOMES.

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:56.235
SECOND THIS MEASURE ASKED THE

00:03:56.302 --> 00:03:57.570
DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND

00:04:20.493 --> 00:04:22.729
FALLS AND TO FACILITATE AGING IN

00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:24.430
PLACE THESE FEATURES COULD

00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:26.432
INCLUDE THINGS LIKE ONE GROUND

KITCHENS FOR MANEUVERABILITY OF

00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:35.041

A STEP FREE PATH THROUGH THE

00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:45.218
ENTIRE GROUND FLOOR.

00:04:45.284 --> 00:04:46.052
SIMPLE MEASURES LIKE THIS WHICH

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:47.920
SHOULD AS CALIFORNIA CONTINUES

00:04:47.987 --> 00:04:50.423

HELP PEOPLE PREVENT THOSE FALLS

00:04:52.925 --> 00:04:54.327
IN THE EXTRAORDINARY COSTS

THE UNITED STATES TODAY IT'S

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.297
ESTIMATED.

00:04:58.364 --> 00:05:00.800
THAT WE SPEND FIFTY BILLION

00:05:00.867 --> 00:05:03.403
DOLLARS A YEAR ADDRESSING WHAT

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:05.071
HAPPENS WHEN SENIORS FALL IN

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:07.774
THIS COUNTRY WE CAN DO BETTER.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.176
AND IT IS MY HOPE THAT AS WE

00:05:10.243 --> 00:05:11.310
MOVE THIS.

00:05:11.377 --> 00:05:13.780
LEGISLATION FORWARD WE ARE ABLE

LEG WAS FULLY RECOVERED? FOR

00:06:10.236 --> 00:06:12.371
MANY MONTHS AS OUR HOUSE COULD

NOT ACCOMMODATE HER.

00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:16.175
IN A WHEELCHAIR.

00:06:16.242 --> 00:06:18.010
HER HUSBAND WAS UNABLE TO CARE

FOR HER IN THE HOME.

00:06:19.812 --> 00:06:21.280
AND AS THE WHEELCHAIR COULD NOT

THUS MAKING HER MORE ISOLATED.

00:06:32.692 --> 00:06:34.193
GIVEN CALIFORNIA'S NEED TO DROP

IT'S IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WE DO

AMAZING TO ME HOW MANY.

00:15:19.218 --> 00:15:22.321
DEVELOPERS ALREADY INCORPORATING

00:15:22.388 --> 00:15:25.491
A LOT OF COMMON SENSE --

00:15:25.557 --> 00:15:29.728
IMPROVEMENTS SAID CERTAINLY ARE.

00:15:29.795 --> 00:15:31.297
LESS EXPENSIVE IN THE FRONT AND

00:15:31.363 --> 00:15:32.164
INSTEAD OF GOING BACK AND

00:15:32.231 --> 00:15:33.165
RETROFITTING ON THE ON THE ON

VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING IN THE BILL

00:15:40.306 --> 00:15:42.641
EXCEPT -- FALL PREVENTION

00:15:42.708 --> 00:15:45.644
BUILDING STANDARDS -- IN MANY OF

00:15:45.711 --> 00:15:47.546
THESE DEVELOMENTS THAT I GO SEE --

00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:49.114
IF YOU WANNA HAVE WIDER DOORS

00:15:49.181 --> 00:15:52.851
AND SMALLER CLOSETS AS A RESULT.

00:15:52.918 --> 00:15:56.021
FOR IT -- IT'S USUALLY AN OPTION

00:15:56.088 --> 00:15:58.557
THAT YOU CAN DO -- THE BUILDING

00:15:58.624 --> 00:15:59.224
ENTRIES MENTIONED THEY HAVE TO

00:15:59.291 --> 00:16:01.226
GO BACK AND AND REDO ALL OF

00:16:01.293 --> 00:16:03.028
THEIR PLANS AND SOMETHING'S GOT

00:16:03.095 --> 00:16:04.563
TO GIVE THE ONE THING THAT WON'T.

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:05.998
GO DOWN AS THE PRICE AND WE'RE

00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:07.733
FACING AN AFFORDABILITY CRISIS

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.967
HERE IN.

00:16:09.034 --> 00:16:10.703
IN CALIFORNIA AND WALL IT BE

00:16:10.769 --> 00:16:12.638
GREAT TO SAY THAT WE COULD HAVE

00:16:12.705 --> 00:16:13.872
ALL THESE IMPROVEMENTS IN STOCK

00:16:13.939 --> 00:16:15.341
AND ADDED ADD TO THE COST OF

00:16:15.407 --> 00:16:16.342
HOMES.

00:16:16.408 --> 00:16:18.143
I'M A REALIST AND KNOW THAT IT

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:19.678
WILL INCREASE THE PRICE OF HOMES.

00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:21.447
AND IT'S OKAY IF SOMEBODY'S

00:16:21.513 --> 00:16:23.215
WILLING TO PAY IT AND AND WANTS

00:16:23.282 --> 00:16:24.683
TO HAVE THESE PORTABILITY

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.885
OPTIONS FOR THEM AS THEY AGE OR

00:16:26.952 --> 00:16:29.154
WHEN THEY SELL THEIR HOUSE THEY

00:16:29.221 --> 00:16:31.056
SOUGHT TO AN AGED COUPLE -- BUT

00:16:31.123 --> 00:16:33.092
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT ALL OF US

00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:33.959
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE HIGH

00:16:34.026 --> 00:16:35.127
COST OF HOUSING THE MOST

00:16:35.194 --> 00:16:36.295
EXPENSIVE PRETTY MUCH IN THE

00:16:36.362 --> 00:16:37.763
CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES AND

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:38.997
I'M WORRIED THAT THIS WILL HAVE

00:16:39.064 --> 00:16:41.266
AN EFFECT ON THAT SO -- ARE YOU

00:16:41.333 --> 00:16:42.901
ARE YOU WILLING TO TO WORK WITH

00:16:42.968 --> 00:16:45.604
THE OPPOSITION ON THIS AND I'M

00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:47.072
ALWAYS WILLING TO WORK WITH THE

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:48.207
OPPOSITION TO BILL WHICH HAS GOT

00:16:48.273 --> 00:16:51.110
IT -- SOMETIME LAST WEEK AND OF

00:16:51.176 --> 00:16:54.246
COURSE -- HAPPY TO TO TRY TO

00:16:54.313 --> 00:16:55.981
ADDRESS CONCERNS NO ONE WANTS TO

00:16:56.048 --> 00:16:58.117
MAKE THE COST OF HOUSING MORE

00:16:58.183 --> 00:16:59.551
EXPENSIVE PART OF WHAT WE WERE

00:16:59.618 --> 00:17:01.720
THINKING OF AND IF I MAY.

00:17:01.787 --> 00:17:03.822
US SENATOR OF MY HUSBAND I

00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:05.157
BOUGHT OUR HOUSE THIRTY FIVE

00:17:05.224 --> 00:17:06.425
YEARS AGO.

00:17:06.492 --> 00:17:08.260
LITTLE DID WE EXPECT THAT THAT

00:17:08.327 --> 00:17:09.828
AT SOME POINT IN TIME WE WOULD

00:17:09.895 --> 00:17:11.263
WANT TO OR NEED TO PUT  GRAB

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:12.297
BAR.

00:17:12.364 --> 00:17:14.199
I INTO THE SHOWER -- WHICH WE

00:17:14.266 --> 00:17:16.168
DID ABOUT A YEAR AGO AND MY

00:17:16.235 --> 00:17:18.337
HUSBAND WHO IS NOW THIRTY FIVE

00:17:18.404 --> 00:17:21.106
YEARS OLDER THAN HE WAS WHEN WE

00:17:21.173 --> 00:17:22.074
BOUGHT OUR HOUSE.

00:17:22.141 --> 00:17:23.008
AND FELL AND COMPLETELY TOWARDS

00:17:23.075 --> 00:17:24.376
ROTATOR CUFF.

00:17:24.443 --> 00:17:25.444
SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE

00:17:25.511 --> 00:17:28.080
COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE THE

00:17:28.147 --> 00:17:31.784
VISITS THE REHABILITATION -- I

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:32.885
THINK IT'S RUINED HIS GOLF GAME

00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:34.753
BUT PROBABLY THAT WAS GOT LONG

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.955
GONE BEFORE HIS ROTATOR CUFF

00:17:37.022 --> 00:17:38.824
PROBLEMS.

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:41.326
YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY IF WE CAN BE

00:17:41.393 --> 00:17:45.230
PREPARED AND ANTICIPATE TO THE

00:17:45.297 --> 00:17:46.965
EXTENT WE CAN DO IT REASONABLY

00:17:47.032 --> 00:17:48.634
AND LOGICALLY SO THE BASICALLY

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.536
ALL NEED THAT NEEDED TO BE DONE

00:17:50.602 --> 00:17:51.203
WAS.

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:52.371
TO HAVE IN THE SHOWER THE

00:17:52.438 --> 00:17:54.206
ABILITY AT SOME POINT IN TIME

00:17:54.273 --> 00:17:55.641
THE WAY YOU GET THE HOUSE TO TO

00:17:55.707 --> 00:17:56.942
BE CONSTRUCTED.

00:17:57.009 --> 00:17:58.644
OUT WOULD ALLOW FOR THAT GRAB

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:00.379
BAR IF IF APPROPRIATE OR

00:18:00.446 --> 00:18:01.947
NECESSARY AND THAT'S BASICALLY

00:18:02.014 --> 00:18:03.015
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THAT

00:18:03.081 --> 00:18:05.884
WE AS WE AS WE BUILD NEW HOUSING

00:18:05.951 --> 00:18:07.453
WE KEEP KEEP IN MIND.

00:18:07.519 --> 00:18:09.521
THAT AT SOME POINT IN TIME GOD

00:18:09.588 --> 00:18:10.322
FOR BID WE HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER

00:18:10.389 --> 00:18:11.290
WHO.

00:18:11.356 --> 00:18:13.659
SUFFERS FROM MS FOR SOME --

00:18:13.725 --> 00:18:15.494
DEBILITATING A SITUATION THAT

00:18:15.561 --> 00:18:17.362
REQUIRES THEM.

00:18:17.429 --> 00:18:19.865
TO BE -- TRANSPORTED IN A CHAIR

00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:21.467
FOR EXAMPLE JUST TO HAVE THOSE

00:18:21.533 --> 00:18:23.936
OPTIONS AVAILABLE AT THE BOTTOM

00:18:24.002 --> 00:18:25.971
THE MOST OPPORTUNE PRICE

00:18:26.038 --> 00:18:27.473
POSSIBLE SO CERTAINLY I

00:18:27.539 --> 00:18:31.310
APPRECIATE THAT THE OPPOSITION --

00:18:31.376 --> 00:18:34.346
SEES THE THE GOOD INTENTIONS IN

00:18:34.413 --> 00:18:36.248
THE POSITIVE ASPECTS OF THIS AND

00:18:36.315 --> 00:18:37.783
WE'RE CERTAINLY I'M CERTAINLY

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:39.051
HAPPY TO WORK WITH THEM TO SEE

00:18:39.117 --> 00:18:40.652
IF WE CAN'T COME TO EAT AND EVEN

00:18:40.719 --> 00:18:41.386
BETTER.

00:18:41.453 --> 00:18:42.921
UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT WE CAN

00:18:42.988 --> 00:18:44.156
DO BECAUSE THE GOAL AGAIN WHEN

00:18:44.223 --> 00:18:46.158
IT COST FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS

00:18:46.225 --> 00:18:48.594
ANNUALLY AS YOU MENTION 50%

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.329
THOSE PEOPLE FALL THEY NEVER

00:18:50.395 --> 00:18:51.296
RECOVER.

00:18:51.363 --> 00:18:52.998
OR THEY END UP IN THE HOUSE --

00:18:53.065 --> 00:18:55.834
INSTITUTIONAL CARE WHERE EITHER

00:18:55.901 --> 00:18:57.970
MEDICARE OUR MEDICARE IS PAYING

00:18:58.036 --> 00:18:59.838
FOR IT GRAB BARKING COOKING --

00:18:59.905 --> 00:19:01.607
COST AS LITTLE AS A FEW HUNDRED

00:19:01.673 --> 00:19:02.241
DOLLARS.

00:19:02.307 --> 00:19:03.876
THOUSANDS THAT IT'S SAFE TO SAY

00:19:03.942 --> 00:19:05.077
NOTHING OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE

00:19:05.143 --> 00:19:07.079
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM

00:19:07.145 --> 00:19:08.614
THOSE EVENTS IN AS YOU KNOW

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.516
BEING SOMEONE WHO'S VERY ACUTELY

00:19:10.582 --> 00:19:12.851
AWARE IN THE MEDICAL FIELD YOU

00:19:12.918 --> 00:19:13.051
DON'T.

00:19:13.118 --> 00:19:15.454
WE LOSE OUR BALANCE A AS WE AGE

00:19:15.521 --> 00:19:17.256
AND THESE KINDS OF THINGS BECOME

00:19:17.322 --> 00:19:19.157
MORE AND MORE PREVALENT SO HAPPY

00:19:19.224 --> 00:19:20.926
TO WORK WITH THEM APPRECIATE

00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:22.861
THEIR WILLINGNESS TO DO SO AS

00:19:22.928 --> 00:19:29.968
WELL ONE PRESHEAF THAT AND

00:19:30.035 --> 00:19:31.904
OWNING A LOT OF SENIOR ONLY --

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:33.772
UNITS MYSELF -- I OCCASIONALLY

GET SENIORS TO COME IN AND SAY

00:19:34.973 --> 00:19:36.608
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO LISA'S

00:19:36.675 --> 00:19:37.743

BUCKS I MEAN IS IT'S REALLY

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.218
INEXPENSIVE TO PUT THE MAN EVEN.

00:19:46.285 --> 00:19:47.886
YOU KNOW WITHOUT HAVING THEM AS

00:19:47.953 --> 00:19:49.955
A PART OF A MANDATE TO PUT A MAN

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:50.622
WHEN YOU'RE BUILDING A BRAND NEW

00:19:50.689 --> 00:19:52.324

THE IN THE BUDGET AS WELL --

00:20:27.392 --> 00:20:28.894

KNOW IT WAS THAT SPECIFIC STUDY.

00:20:41.773 --> 00:20:43.175
BUT A STUDY THAT ACTUALLY SHOW

00:20:43.241 --> 00:20:44.176
THAT WAS THE FIRST TO

00:20:44.242 --> 00:20:46.011
DEMONSTRATE THAT THE FALLS THAT

00:20:46.078 --> 00:20:47.613
LEAD TO HAVE FRACTURES THE TIMER

00:20:47.679 --> 00:20:48.914
TOLERATE WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE

00:20:48.981 --> 00:20:50.182
WAY BACK THEN.

00:20:50.248 --> 00:20:51.583
SO I ACTUALLY DID SOME RESEARCH

WITH THE BUILDING FOLKS IT IS

00:21:06.765 --> 00:21:07.966
PROBABLY MORE OF AN ISSUE I

00:21:08.033 --> 00:21:09.601
GUESS THE HOUSING AND I THINK

00:21:09.668 --> 00:21:10.936

00:21:11.003 --> 00:21:12.537
WEIGH IN ON THAT TWENTY GETS TO

00:21:12.604 --> 00:21:14.673

SHARE SOME OF THEIR STONES

00:21:19.711 --> 00:21:20.912

00:21:21.913 --> 00:21:23.649
THE HOUSE READY -- FOR FOR SOME

00:21:23.715 --> 00:21:24.983
PEOPLE IN AGING PLACE I THINK

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:27.119
IT'S A GOOD THING -- YOU MIGHT

00:21:27.185 --> 00:21:29.254

AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS -- AND

00:21:36.395 --> 00:21:37.496
THEN I START THINKING WELL IF

00:21:37.562 --> 00:21:38.964

00:21:39.031 --> 00:21:40.732

TO INCREASE THE COST.

00:22:33.819 --> 00:22:35.387

WE HAD FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

00:24:51.523 --> 00:24:52.891

00:24:52.958 --> 00:24:55.126
MONEY MONEY MONEY. FOR ALL SORTS

00:24:55.193 --> 00:24:56.895
OF THINGS BUT THE REALITY IS IN

00:24:56.962 --> 00:24:58.897
THE FRUSTRATION THAT I HAVE

00:24:58.964 --> 00:25:00.465
EXPERIENCED HAS.

00:25:00.532 --> 00:25:02.100
HOW DO YOU TRANSLATE NOT ACTION

ALL THIS STUFF.

00:25:14.412 --> 00:25:16.047
AND WHAT IS TRANSPIRING.

00:25:16.114 --> 00:25:17.782
AND SO I BEGAN TO FOCUS ON ONE

00:25:17.849 --> 00:25:18.950
OF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO IN

00:25:19.017 --> 00:25:20.085
THE HUMAN CONDITION BROADLY

00:25:20.151 --> 00:25:21.753
SPEAKING.

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.655
IF YOU WILL -- THAT IMPACT

00:25:23.722 --> 00:25:25.457
PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT CAN IMPACT

00:25:25.523 --> 00:25:26.658
THE PRICE OF THE THE ISSUE OF

00:25:26.725 --> 00:25:27.893
PEOPLE FIND THEMSELVES HOMELESS

00:25:27.959 --> 00:25:29.194
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE ATTACKS

00:25:29.261 --> 00:25:30.762
AND WINNER DURING THE BREAK ON

00:25:30.829 --> 00:25:31.630
THIS A LITTLE BIT I THINK.

00:25:31.696 --> 00:25:33.164
MEMBER CORRECTLY.

00:25:33.231 --> 00:25:35.233
AND ARM WHAT WE FOUND IN THE

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:36.468
COMMUNITY IS I WAS TRAVELING

00:25:36.534 --> 00:25:37.335
THROUGH ALL THE NEIGHBORHOOD

00:25:37.402 --> 00:25:39.638
COUNCILS AND TALKING TO FOLKS

00:25:39.704 --> 00:25:40.238
WHO FOUND THEMSELVES HOMELESS

00:25:40.305 --> 00:25:40.639
WAS.

00:25:40.705 --> 00:25:43.375
AS WAS SUGGESTED TO ME ELEGANTLY.

00:25:43.441 --> 00:25:44.209
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GO OUT AND

00:25:44.276 --> 00:25:45.343
DO A SHELTER LEAVE THEIR BEST

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:47.646
FRIEND ON THE STREET.

00:25:47.712 --> 00:25:49.481
AND SOMETIMES OUR BEST FRIENDS.

00:25:49.547 --> 00:25:51.283
AND SO THE IDEA HERE WAS TO

00:25:51.349 --> 00:25:53.285
START OUT WITH A I MEAN I'VE

00:25:53.351 --> 00:25:54.486
EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCIL EVERY

00:25:54.552 --> 00:25:55.787
PLACE IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY

00:25:55.854 --> 00:25:56.988
THIS IS.

00:25:57.055 --> 00:25:58.456
SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY GETS A

00:25:58.523 --> 00:26:00.058
AND IT'S YOU KNOW IN LOS ANGELES

00:26:00.125 --> 00:26:01.126
I'M TOLD.

00:26:01.192 --> 00:26:02.627
THAT IT COULD BE AS HIGH AS 25%

00:26:02.694 --> 00:26:04.496
OF PEOPLE WITH PETS SO HERE WE

00:26:04.562 --> 00:26:06.631
ARE IN IN LA COUNTY GOT 22% FOR

00:26:06.698 --> 00:26:08.566
SOME FACILITIES ON MICE WITH 22%

00:26:08.633 --> 00:26:10.402
WITH OPEN BEDS BECAUSE PEOPLE

00:26:10.468 --> 00:26:11.636
WON'T GO BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT TO

00:26:11.703 --> 00:26:12.270
LEAVE THEIR BEST FRIEND ON THE

00:26:12.337 --> 00:26:13.305
STREETS.

00:26:13.371 --> 00:26:14.973
AND SO THIS IS THE FIRST STEP OF

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.308
PUTTING FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND

00:26:16.374 --> 00:26:17.475
LIKE YOU TO MAKE A LOT BIGGER

00:26:17.542 --> 00:26:18.610
QUITE FRANKLY HAVE A GRANT

00:26:18.677 --> 00:26:20.111
PROGRAM ACCEPTING YOUR MEMBERS

00:26:20.178 --> 00:26:21.846
JUST WHERE THE MONEY IS TO GO.

00:26:21.913 --> 00:26:23.315
TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES

00:26:23.381 --> 00:26:24.783
AND AVAILABILITY OF PEOPLE WHEN

00:26:24.849 --> 00:26:26.418
THEY GO IN -- TO THESE

00:26:26.484 --> 00:26:27.519
FACILITIES THEY CAN BRING THEIR

00:26:27.585 --> 00:26:28.954
PETS WITH THEM AND OFTEN IT

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:30.822
BEGINS TO HELP THEM AS I'M TOLD

00:26:30.889 --> 00:26:32.357
TO GET OFF THE MARK STREET AS

00:26:32.424 --> 00:26:34.025
THEY CAN GET SERVICES FOR THEIR

00:26:34.092 --> 00:26:35.060
PETS THEY CAN ALSO HELP

00:26:35.126 --> 00:26:36.161
THEMSELVES.

00:26:36.227 --> 00:26:37.329
IN THAT REGARD AND IT'S OKAY

00:26:37.395 --> 00:26:38.730
QUITE FRANKLY JUST CONSIDERING

00:26:38.797 --> 00:26:40.065
THE BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF

00:26:40.131 --> 00:26:44.035
DOLLARS THAT WE'VE AUTHORIZED.

00:26:44.102 --> 00:26:44.703
GENERAL FUNDS DOLLARS THAT WE'VE

00:26:44.769 --> 00:26:45.537
AUTHORIZED.

00:26:45.603 --> 00:26:46.771
AND NEW TAXES THAT WE'VE

00:26:46.838 --> 00:26:49.574
AUTHORIZED THIS TO ME IS

00:26:49.641 --> 00:26:52.010
SOMETHING THAT -- YOU KNOW AS WE

00:26:52.077 --> 00:26:53.645

OF MAGNITUDE BUT I THINK GIVEN

00:27:00.352 --> 00:27:01.886
THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE FACING

00:27:01.953 --> 00:27:02.654
FOR PEOPLE TO FIND THEMSELVES

00:27:02.721 --> 00:27:03.455
HOMELESS IS.

00:27:03.521 --> 00:27:04.522
IT IS THE RIGHT APPROPRIATE

00:27:04.589 --> 00:27:05.957
THING TO DO WITH THIS I WILL

00:27:06.024 --> 00:27:08.693
TURN THIS OVER TO MY WITNESSES

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.396

SACRAMENTO -- TODAY TO URGE YOU

00:27:18.303 --> 00:27:20.705
TO SUPPORT THAT BILL TO FIFTY

00:27:20.772 --> 00:27:22.440
EIGHT THE HUMAN ANIMAL BOND IS

00:27:22.507 --> 00:27:23.842
INCREDIBLY POWERFUL.

00:27:23.908 --> 00:27:25.844
AND IF YOU HAVE PETS THINK ABOUT

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:27.112
THEM RIGHT NOW.

00:27:27.178 --> 00:27:28.413
ACCORDING TO THE NEW ENGLAND

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.514
JOURNAL OF MEDICINE THAT POP

00:27:29.581 --> 00:27:31.383
REPORT WAS PUBLISHED BACK IN TWO

00:27:31.449 --> 00:27:31.950
THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN THAT

00:27:32.017 --> 00:27:33.518
STATED THAT THE LOSS OF A

00:27:33.585 --> 00:27:34.986
BELOVED PET CAN IMPAIR OUR

00:27:35.053 --> 00:27:35.920
EMOTIONAL.

00:27:35.987 --> 00:27:38.223
AND PHYSICAL HEALTH OFTEN TIMES

00:27:38.289 --> 00:27:41.026
WORSE FOR THE LOSS OF A SPOUSE

00:27:41.092 --> 00:27:42.093
WHICH I FOUND PRETTY AMAZING.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.862
WHETHER YOU LIVE IN A HOUSE OR

00:27:43.928 --> 00:27:45.163
YOU LIVE IN A TENT ALONG THE

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:46.498
AMERICAN RIVER.

00:27:46.564 --> 00:27:49.167
MAKES NO DIFFERENCE YOUR BOND

00:27:49.234 --> 00:27:49.901
AND YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR

00:27:49.968 --> 00:27:52.170
PAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT DIFFERENT

00:27:52.237 --> 00:27:53.204
AND I CAN ATTEST TO THAT FIRST

00:27:53.271 --> 00:27:55.774
HAND.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.075
BONDS OFTEN EVEN STRONGER FOR

00:27:57.142 --> 00:27:58.977
PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS

00:27:59.044 --> 00:28:00.845
NOT JUST COMPANIONSHIP AND

00:28:00.912 --> 00:28:01.546
PROTECTION.

00:28:01.613 --> 00:28:04.783
BUT PURPOSE -- SOMETHING TO LIVE

00:28:04.849 --> 00:28:06.317
FOR AND SOMETHING TO CARE.

00:28:06.384 --> 00:28:07.385
FOR AND I'VE HEARD IT OVER AND

00:28:07.452 --> 00:28:08.920
OVER IF I DIDN'T HAVE MY PAT I

00:28:08.987 --> 00:28:10.688
DON'T THINK I COULD SURVIVE ON

00:28:10.755 --> 00:28:13.324
THE STREET -- IT IS A REASON TO

00:28:13.391 --> 00:28:14.392
GO ON LIVING FOR THEM IN MANY

00:28:14.459 --> 00:28:15.894
CASES.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.796

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:23.301
THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN THE FRENCH

REDOUBTABLE SHELTER HAS INVESTED

00:28:24.836 --> 00:28:26.738
THROUGH GENERAL FIND GRANTS

00:28:26.805 --> 00:28:28.339
FUNDRAISING.

00:28:28.406 --> 00:28:29.274
ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:30.942

00:28:31.009 --> 00:28:32.677
PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS CRATES

FOOD LEASHES EVEN SOME BEHAVIOR

00:28:34.312 --> 00:28:35.947
TRAINING SO PETS CAN BE COULD

00:28:36.014 --> 00:28:37.782
COMPANION STAYED AND PREVENT

00:28:37.849 --> 00:28:40.218
BEING A BARRIER FROM HOUSING --

00:28:40.285 --> 00:28:41.553
THAT WAS JUST AT THE WINNER

00:28:41.619 --> 00:28:42.987
TRIAGE SHELTER UP ON RAILROAD

00:28:43.054 --> 00:28:44.522

00:28:44.589 --> 00:28:45.457
COSTS.

00:28:45.523 --> 00:28:46.691
DOES NOT INCLUDE -- THOSE

00:28:46.758 --> 00:28:48.526
ANIMALS THAT CAME TO US AND HAD

00:28:48.593 --> 00:28:49.594
TO BE IMPOUNDED BECAUSE THEIR

00:28:49.661 --> 00:28:51.596
OWNERS WERE EITHER HOSPITALIZED

00:28:51.663 --> 00:28:53.364
OR INCARCERATED WHICH HAPPENS

00:28:53.431 --> 00:28:54.265
FREQUENTLY.

00:28:54.332 --> 00:28:55.867
THE THESE ARE THE ANIMALS THAT

00:28:55.934 --> 00:28:57.202
ARE MOST AT RISK IN OUR

00:28:57.268 --> 00:28:59.471
COMMUNITIES TO END UP IN OUR

00:28:59.537 --> 00:29:02.807
SHELTER.

00:29:02.874 --> 00:29:04.342
I CAN ATTEST FIRST HAND AGAIN

00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:06.544
PEOPLE REFUSE MEDICAL AID IF IT

00:29:06.611 --> 00:29:07.812
MEANS THEY HAVE TO GIVE UP THEIR

00:29:07.879 --> 00:29:09.247
PETS.

00:29:09.314 --> 00:29:11.449
LITERALLY WILLING TO DIE --

00:29:11.516 --> 00:29:12.917
BEFORE THEY LEAVE THEIR ANIMALS

00:29:12.984 --> 00:29:14.486
OFTEN THEIR ANIMALS EAT BEFORE

00:29:14.552 --> 00:29:16.020
THEY DO.

00:29:16.087 --> 00:29:17.555
WE ALL KNOW HOME IS AS AS AN

00:29:17.622 --> 00:29:19.824

COMPLETELY MY ONLY CONCERN.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:32.136
IS -- HOW WE CAN GO ABOUT DOING

00:34:32.203 --> 00:34:33.671
THIS BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO

00:34:33.738 --> 00:34:35.673
ARE HOMELESS DON'T HAVE THE

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:37.608
RESOURCES TO CARE FOR THEIR

00:34:37.675 --> 00:34:39.510

YOU KNOW SOME KIND OF CONDITION

00:34:52.657 --> 00:34:55.660
THAT IS POTENTIALLY TRANSFERABLE --

00:34:55.726 --> 00:34:57.195
IS THERE IS THERE IS SOME

00:34:57.261 --> 00:34:58.996
PROTOCOL THAT THAT CAN BE

00:34:59.063 --> 00:35:01.165
DEVELOPED SO THAT WE CAN MAKE

00:35:01.232 --> 00:35:02.066
SURE THAT.

00:35:02.133 --> 00:35:04.202
IF PEOPLE BRING THEIR ANIMALS IN

00:35:04.268 --> 00:35:05.002
AND THEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO

00:35:05.069 --> 00:35:06.904
BRINGS IN A SICK ANIMAL THAT

00:35:06.971 --> 00:35:08.139
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TRANSFER

00:35:08.206 --> 00:35:09.607
TRANSMIT THAT IT.

00:35:09.674 --> 00:35:11.342
THAT ILLNESS TO THE OTHER

00:35:11.409 --> 00:35:12.643
ANIMALS THERE BECAUSE THAT'S THE

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:14.011
QUICKEST WAY TO GET PEOPLE TO

00:35:14.078 --> 00:35:15.680
SAY FORGET IT I'D RATHER BE ON

00:35:15.746 --> 00:35:16.914
THE STREET SO.

00:35:16.981 --> 00:35:18.316
IN THIS PROGRAM IS THERE SOME

00:35:18.382 --> 00:35:20.184
DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW YOU GONNA

00:35:20.251 --> 00:35:21.919
GO ABOUT MAKING SURE FIRST OF

00:35:21.986 --> 00:35:23.187
ALL AN OPPORTUNITY GET THESE

00:35:23.254 --> 00:35:25.189
ANIMALS FOOD MEDICAL CARE THAT

00:35:25.256 --> 00:35:26.924
THEY NEED TO HAVE ANYWAY -- OR

00:35:26.991 --> 00:35:28.693
SHOULD HAVE BUT DO IT IN A WAY

00:35:28.759 --> 00:35:29.994
THAT PROTECTS THE OTHER ANIMALS

00:35:30.061 --> 00:35:31.863
WHO MIGHT BE IN THE SHELTER

00:35:31.929 --> 00:35:32.530
THANK YOU SENATOR THAT'S EXACTLY

00:35:32.597 --> 00:35:35.333
CORRECT. TO QUALIFY FOR A GRANT

00:35:35.399 --> 00:35:37.268
TO SUCH A SHELTER MUST HAVE

00:35:37.335 --> 00:35:38.469
THREE THINGS FIRST.

00:35:38.536 --> 00:35:39.737
SHELTER FOOD AND BASIC

00:35:39.804 --> 00:35:41.239
VETERINARY SERVICES FOR PETS OF

00:35:41.305 --> 00:35:42.874
THE HOMELESS OF THE PEOPLE THAT

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:44.542
FIND THEMSELVES HOMELESS TO

00:35:44.609 --> 00:35:45.877
SHELTERS MUST ESTABLISH YOUR

00:35:45.943 --> 00:35:47.445
PHARMACIST IS RULES OF CONDUCT

00:35:47.512 --> 00:35:49.046
RESPONSIBILITY REGARDING PETS

00:35:49.113 --> 00:35:50.147
AND THEIR OWNERS.

00:35:50.214 --> 00:35:51.349
CREATING -- KENNELLY EITHER

00:35:51.415 --> 00:35:53.417
BUNKS OR IN SEPARATE AREAS AND

00:35:53.484 --> 00:35:54.619
FOOD FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCES

00:35:54.685 --> 00:35:56.854
HOMELESSNESS WITH ANIMALS AND

00:35:56.921 --> 00:35:58.089
THREE SHELTERS AND ALSO NEED TO

00:35:58.155 --> 00:35:59.757
HAVE ACCESS TO A SHELTER THAT AN

00:35:59.824 --> 00:36:01.626
OFFER SPAY AND NEUTER SERVICES

00:36:01.692 --> 00:36:03.094
SO THE IDEA OF HAVING THE VAT.

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.629
AND THOSE SERVICES PART OF IT

00:36:04.695 --> 00:36:05.730
WOULD BE THE REQUIREMENTS TO

00:36:05.796 --> 00:36:10.701
QUALIFY FOR ONE OF THESE GRANTS

00:36:10.768 --> 00:36:11.569
THEY WOULD APPLY.

00:36:11.636 --> 00:36:12.303
FOR I GUESS MY ONLY CONCERN FOR

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:13.004
ME TO THE CHAIR IS SPAY AND

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:14.705
NEUTER VERY IMPORTANT BUT I'M

00:36:14.772 --> 00:36:16.507
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT PETS WHO

00:36:16.574 --> 00:36:18.509
MIGHT COME IN WITH SOME.

00:36:18.576 --> 00:36:20.578
KIND OF COMMUNICABLE OR PROBLEM

00:36:20.645 --> 00:36:22.680
THAT COULD RUN THROUGH THE

00:36:22.747 --> 00:36:24.815
SHELTER SO IS THERE SO WHEN YOU

00:36:24.882 --> 00:36:26.551
SAY GENERAL SERVICES.

00:36:26.617 --> 00:36:27.618
CAN YOU MAYBE BE A LITTLE BIT

00:36:27.685 --> 00:36:29.186
MORE SPECIFIC CHEST SO WE CAN

00:36:29.253 --> 00:36:30.755
MAKE SURE THAT WERE.

00:36:30.821 --> 00:36:32.490
THAT THAT THESE ANIMALS ARE NOT

00:36:32.557 --> 00:36:35.927
GOING TO BE -- EXPOSING OTHER

00:36:35.993 --> 00:36:37.929
OTHER PATHS TO POTENTIAL SERIOUS

00:36:37.995 --> 00:36:39.697
PROBLEMS THAT WE KNOW SOMETIMES

00:36:39.764 --> 00:36:41.065
DUE TO I THINK I THINK WE COULD

00:36:41.132 --> 00:36:42.233
PUSH MORE DEFINITION AROUND

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:43.568
ABOUT THE IDEA OF HOW REQUIRING

00:36:43.634 --> 00:36:45.102
A SHELTER OF THAT OF HAVING OF

00:36:45.169 --> 00:36:46.837
THAT THEY ARE TO BE EXAMINED THE

00:36:46.904 --> 00:36:48.172
ANIMALS AND THE LIKE.

00:36:48.239 --> 00:36:49.507
I ASSUME AS A RESULT OF THEIR

00:36:49.574 --> 00:36:51.309
EXPERIENCES A VETERINARIAN WOULD

00:36:51.375 --> 00:36:52.777
THEN MAKE THOSE DETERMINATIONS.

00:36:52.843 --> 00:36:54.378
AS ANY GOOD MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL

00:36:54.445 --> 00:36:55.813
WOULD AND AND AND SORT OF THOSE

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.114
STANDARDS I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE

00:36:57.181 --> 00:36:58.316
MEAN BY SETTING UP THOSE

00:36:58.382 --> 00:36:58.883
STANDARDS WITH THE WITH THE

00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:59.784
SHELTER THAT.

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:01.118
I WOULD FEEL A LITTLE MORE

00:37:01.185 --> 00:37:02.420
COMFORTABLE I'M GOING TO VOTE

00:37:02.486 --> 00:37:03.487
FOR THE BILL BUT I'D FEEL MORE

00:37:03.554 --> 00:37:04.622
COMFORTABLE IF YOU COULD BE A

00:37:04.689 --> 00:37:06.691
LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT

00:37:06.757 --> 00:37:08.659
SORT OF THE HIGH HIDE ADDRESSING

00:37:08.726 --> 00:37:10.394
THAT POTENTIAL PROBLEMS WITH IT

00:37:10.461 --> 00:37:13.998
THAT IT.

00:37:14.065 --> 00:37:15.266
IS COVERED IMMEDIATELY.

00:37:15.333 --> 00:37:16.400
AND WITHOUT THE RISKS.

00:37:16.467 --> 00:37:18.169
OF THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE.

00:37:18.235 --> 00:37:19.070
TAKE PLACE WHICH I KNOW YOU

00:37:19.136 --> 00:37:20.638
DON'T WANT BUT I JUST I KNOW

00:37:20.705 --> 00:37:22.907
THAT THERE ARE INSTANCES A DOGLE

00:37:22.974 --> 00:37:24.909
COMING WITH MANGE FOR EXAMPLE --

00:37:24.976 --> 00:37:27.745
OR SOME CONDITION AND I THINK

00:37:27.812 --> 00:37:30.214
THAT AS MUCH OF THIS IS A

00:37:30.281 --> 00:37:31.882
SPECIFIC.

00:37:31.949 --> 00:37:33.217
REQUIREMENT THAT WHOEVER'S GONNA

TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NO

THAT THAT THESE ANIMALS WILL NOT

00:37:41.392 --> 00:37:43.060
BE IN DANGER -- OR BE

00:37:43.127 --> 00:37:44.895
TRANSMITTING POTENTIALLY DATE A

00:37:44.962 --> 00:37:46.897
DANGERS ARE FATAL ILLNESSES TO

00:37:46.964 --> 00:37:48.899
THE OTHER ANIMALS FOR PEOPLE IN

00:37:48.966 --> 00:37:50.534

00:39:47.218 --> 00:39:47.785
OUT OF THOUGHT WAS KIND OF FUNNY

00:39:47.852 --> 00:39:49.687
THAT THE HE SAID THE BIG GUY WAS

00:39:49.754 --> 00:39:51.188
BITTEN.

00:39:51.255 --> 00:39:53.824
AND SO -- ABOUT FOUR FIVE YEARS

00:39:53.891 --> 00:39:59.530
LATER -- I HAD A STUDENT INTERN

00:39:59.597 --> 00:40:01.465

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:04.902
AS AS A STATE SHE WAS A GRADUATE

00:40:04.969 --> 00:40:06.604
STUDENT DOING INTERNSHIP IN MY

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:08.139
OFFICE.

00:40:08.205 --> 00:40:10.341
AND SHE SIGNED UP TO WORK ON THE

00:40:10.407 --> 00:40:11.976
FOSTER CARE PROGRAM.

00:40:12.042 --> 00:40:13.911
AND SHE SAYS WELL CENTER CENTER

00:40:13.978 --> 00:40:16.247

00:40:26.457 --> 00:40:27.725
HOMELESS GIRL.

00:40:27.792 --> 00:40:30.928
GREW UP GOT HER DEGREE AND YOU

WORKER PRACTICING IN SAN JOSE SO

00:40:43.374 --> 00:40:47.344

00:40:47.411 --> 00:40:50.681
DOGS OR IMPORTANT ANGLE PART OF

00:40:50.748 --> 00:40:52.817
