ASSEMBLY BILL ONE NO ONE BY THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON BUDGET AND THAT GOING TO HOUSING AND MAKING A PROVISION THEREFORE TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BILL RELIGION BUT CENTER MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT AND GOOD AFTERNOON COLLEAGUES AB ONE ON ONE IS THE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS TRAILER BILL. WHICH CONTAINS STATUTORY CHANGES NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY NINETEEN IT CONTAINS SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS AS WELL AS MAJOR POLICY CHANGES. TO ADDRESS AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS. MOST SIGNIFICANTLY THE BILL DOES THE FOLLOWING IT PROVIDES FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN STATE FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS INCLUDING. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR CITIES COUNTIES AND WE JUST THE PLAN FOR ADDITIONAL HOUSING CAPACITY IN COORDINATION WITH THE SIX CYCLE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FOR HOUSING RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN ADDITIONAL STATE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY THE FINANCE MIXED INCOME DEVELOPMENT. SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION TO ASSIST CITIES COUNTIES AND THE CEO SEES CONTINUUM'S OF CARE AND ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS. IT CREATES EXPANDED JUDICIAL REMEDIES THE STATE MAY PURSUE AGAINST JURISDICTIONS THAT FAIL TO COMPLY WITH STATE HOUSING ELEMENT LAW. INCLUDING THE IMPOSITION OF FINES INTEREST UP A FUNDS AN APPOINTMENT AGENTS OF THE COURT. IT PROVIDES A STREAMLINED APPROVAL PROCESS FOR HIGH-QUALITY LOW BARRIER NAVIGATION CENTERS THE MOVE HOMELESS PEOPLE TO PERMANENT HOUSING. IT EXPANDS AND UPDATES THE CAL HOME LOCAL HOUSING TRUST FUND AND HE JOE CERTAINLY JUNIOR FARM WORKER HOUSING PROGRAMS TO ALLOW THOSE PROGRAMS TO BETTER SUPPORT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. ACROSS THE STATE. IT MAKES OTHER TECHNICAL OR CONFORMING CHANGES TO OTHER STATE OR HOUSING HOMELESS THIS PROGRAM MEMBERS I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATOR WIENER. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT. COLLEAGUES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB -- ONE OH ONE WHICH WILL -- HAS A NUMBER OF VERY VERY -- PRO HOUSING -- COMPONENTS INCLUDING -- PUTTING US ON A PATH TO IMPROVE THE VERY BROKEN RINA PROCESS SO THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY ASSIGNING HOUSING GOALS BASED ON HOUSING NEED -- WITH RIDE SIP SIGNIFICANT -- NEW FUNDING AND STRUCTURE THAT FUNDING -- TO HELP OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING FOR FORMALLY HOMELESS PEOPLE -- AS WELL AS INSURER -- THAT EMERGENCY SHELTER NAVIGATION CENTERS CAN ACTUALLY BE CITED -- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THAT WE CAN HELP TRANSITION PEOPLE OFF OF THE STREET AND THE SERVICES -- THE BILL -- ALSO PUTS -- TEETH -- INTO EXISTING HOUSING LAWS -- AND INSURERS THAT OR I SHE SENDS A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT WHEN WE SAY. THIS IS WHAT'S REQUIRED OF OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN TERMS OF PLANNING FOR HOUSING -- THAT WE NEED IT -- AND THAT THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES IF -- THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN SO THIS IS A VERY -- GOOD PIECE OF LEGISLATION TO STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND I SUPPORT A I DO WANT TO KNOW -- THAT THIS IS -- THE A STOP IT'S A STRONG AND GOOD STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT MORE WORK TO DO -- THIS BILL FOCUS IS -- UNDERSTANDABLY ON THE THINGS THAT I JUST MENTIONED -- BY WHAT WE STILL NEED TO DO WHAT WHAT THIS BILL DOES NOT DO AND SORT OF CRITICISM OF THE BILL CAN'T DO EVERYTHING ON ONE BILL. WE STILL NEED TO REFORM ZONING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE STILL NEED TO FIND WAYS TO EXPEDITE AND STREAMLINE -- THE APPROVAL OF HOUSING -- WE STILL NEED TO STRENGTHEN RENTER PROTECTIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- AND UNTIL WE REFORM ZONING SO THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY BUILD APARTMENT BUILDINGS ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN MORE PARTS OF CALIFORNIA. UNTIL WE ACTS WITH A HOUSING APPROVALS SO THAT IT DOESN'T TAKE THREE FOUR FIVE TEN YEARS. TO APPROVE HOUSING -- AND UNTIL WE PROTECT THE 40% OF CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE RENTERS BOAT AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHICH HAVE ALMOST NO PROTECTIONS TODAY. UNTIL WE DO THOSE THINGS -- WE WILL STRUGGLE THE KEY PEOPLE STABLE IN OUR HOUSING. AND TO FILL CALIFORNIA'S THREE POINT FIVE MILLION HOME DEFICIT. BUT WITH ALL THAT SAID THIS IS A STRONG STOP WE NEED TO PASS SAYS AND THEN WE NEED TO TAKE THE NEXT UP AND KEEP BUILDING. UNTIL WE HAVE A BRIGHT HOUSING FUTURE FOR CALIFORNIA I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER SENATOR NIELSEN. MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES DOWN THE SENATE I JUST SUPPORT. AND AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO AS NOTED THIS IS A CONTINUAL. WE HAVE HAD MANY. HOMELESS BILLS OVER THE YEARS. SOME WERE TATTERED AS BEING THE GREAT PANACEA NONE HAVE BEEN. AND NONE WILL BE [inaudible] MAYBE EVER. BUT STEPS IN A CRIMINAL STEPS CAN BE TAKEN. THIS BILL DOES PROVIDE A LOT OF RESOURCES. AND SOME MOTIVATION FOR OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AND THOSE MOTIVATIONS CANNOT ALL BE PUNITIVE. WHETHER THAT BE. LITTLE TOWN OF WHEATLAND. OR HUNTINGTON BEACH. THEY HAVE TO BE ENCOURAGING AND ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE GOTTEN IN OUR COMMUNITIES. IS THEY HAVE NOT HAD THE RESOURCES. OR THE ABILITIES. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL. THE SALARIES AND ACCOMMODATION. FOR THIS HOMELESS POPULATION. WHAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HOMELESSNESS THEY ALL FOCUS ON THE SHELTER? A PLACE TO LIVE IN STATE SLEEP EAT. THAT'S ONLY PART OF THE LONG TERM IS DEVELOPING THE SKILLS THE ABILITIES. AND ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF THOSE OF THAT HOMELESS. POPULATION. THAT CAUSES THEM. TO BE CONDEMNED TO THAT LIFESTYLE. NOW MANY LIKE IT. AND THAT'S OKAY IF THEY DO. BUT A GOOD PORTION OF OUR HOMELESS POPULATION. AND SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN FOISTED UPON THOSE COMMUNITIES BY ACTS OF THIS LEGISLATURE. THEY NEED HELP. DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE. MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. SO MANY ARE OVERWHELMING OUR LOCAL E. OURS NOW. AND I'VE HAD MANY COMPLAINTS FROM THE DOCTORS AT THE E. OURS ARE THE NURSES. OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE SHOWN UP. WITH NEEDS THAT THEY CANNOT MEET. I SUPPORTED A BILL A COUPLE YEARS AGO THAT I'VE FORMALLY NEVER WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED GIVING A DOCTOR IN ANY ARE THE ABILITY TO IMPOSE A FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLD. ON A MENTALLY UNSTABLE INDIVIDUAL. E. OURS ARE NOT EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH THAT POPULATION. BUT THEY'RE SHOWING UP ANYWAY. IN AND I MUST SAY IN DESPERATION I SAID I DO THAT BILL. IT IS NOT THE ANSWER. NOR IS JUST MORE MONEY BEING POURED IN TO DEALING WITH THE ISSUE. WE HAVE TO ALSO FOCUS IN TERMS OF THE LOCAL NEEDS AND RESOURCES FOR JOB SKILLS AND JOB OPPORTUNITIES. AND TO CREATE A POSITIVE ATTITUDE WITHIN THOSE HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS THAT THEY CAN BE GAINFULLY EMPLOYED. THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES. THAT IS REALLY CRITICAL IF WE'RE TO MOVE AHEAD. IN THE FUTURE [inaudible] AND ALSO. THERE ARE PROVISIONS IN HERE THAT I APPLAUD RELATED TO THE NAVIGATION CENTERS WHICH I HAVE A A STRONG AFFECTION. FOR TO HELP THEM. WITH THE SECRET PROCESS. BUT LADIES AND GENTLEMAN UNTIL WE IS THIS LEGISLATURE ADDRESS THAT SIDE OF THE EQUATION THE DRIVING UP COSTS OF HOUSING. WHICH THE LEGISLATURE LARGER HIS CONTRIBUTED TO OVER THE DECADES. WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET A HANDLE ON THIS. THE COST OF HOUSING. AND I WAS SUBMIT MY ARGUMENT. THE VOICE OF A HOMELESS ADVOCATE ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO IN A COMMITTEE HEARING HERE. A VIGOROUS LONG TERM HOMELESS ADVOCATES. AND SHE SAID DO YOU KNOW THAT THE COST OF A HOUSE. FOR AN INDIVIDUAL. THE HOMELESS INDIVIDUAL. STATE REGULATIONS AND LAWS. ADDED SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO THE COST OF THAT HOUSE. NOW THIS IS NOT [inaudible] SOMEBODY. WHOSE LARGE CONSERVATIVE THAT'S AGGRAVATED AT THE COST OR A BUSINESS PERSON OR A BUILDER. THIS IS A PERSON DEDICATED. THE PROVIDING HOUSING. AND SHE IS SAYING. YOU'RE LETTING THE COSTS IN THE RISING COST OF HOUSING. GET COMPLETELY BEYOND OUR REACH. DOES MEAN WE NEED TO EXPAND SOME OF OUR REGULATIONS IMPOSED BY THE LEGISLATURE. IN THIS PARTICULAR AND VERY SPECIFIC AREA. FAR BEYOND JUST NAVIGATION CENTERS. IT CAN BE DONE. IT SHOULD BE DONE. THOSE ARE AREAS YET THAT DO REQUIRE [inaudible] ATTENTION. THE WIRE JULY VOTE I WILL INDICATE WE HAVE YET MORE TO DO. THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN CENTER HERTZBERG. THANK YOU. MADAM PRESIDENT. THERE IS AN URGENT MORAL ISSUE. WE MUST CONFRONT. THE HOMELESS EPIDEMIC. WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER AS A STATE. THE FOCUS ON PREVENTIONRAPID RE HOUSING MENTAL HEALTH AND MORE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING BECAUSE WELL SHELTERS SOLVE SLEEP. ONLY PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING SOLVES HOMELESSNESS. WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE OTHER FACTORS BEYOND CITY PLANNING THAT HAVE LIMITED OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE HOUSING AND IN RECENT YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. WE'VE. FOR THE JUDICIAL REVIEW ON SEQUEL FOR PROFESSIONAL SPORTS IT'S TIME WE DO THE SAME FOR HOUSING. THOSE ARE THE WORDS OF OUR GOVERNOR AT THE STATE OF THE STATE THAT WE ALL WITNESSED. THAT WAS THE VISION THAT HE SET FORTH AT THAT TIME. WE ARE NOW HERE IN THIS HOUSE CONSIDERING A HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE PAGE BILL. WHICH IN LARGE MEASURE ENCOMPASSES THAT VISION. SOME OF IT'S A LITTLE TOO MUCH DETAIL FOR ME TO COMPREHEND IN THE SHORT TIME FRAME WE'VE HAD. BUT IT IS LARGELY WITHIN THAT FRAME. I DON'T WANT TO SAY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE URGENT NATURE OF THIS LARGER ISSUE IS THAT I AM IMPATIENT. IN THE CITIES THAT I REPRESENT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE WHOLE THE ISSUE OF HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS IS NOTHING LESS AN EXTRAORDINARY. AND WELL THERE ARE CERTAIN REMEDIES IS PART OF THE INCENTIVE THERE CERTAIN INCENTIVES IN THIS CERTAIN REMEDIES WE NEED TO DO MORE. WE NEED TO WORK FASTER PEOPLE THAT ARE IN GOVERNMENTNEED TO WORK HARDER THE TIME LINES HAVE TO BE SHORTER EVEN THOUGH IN SOME PARTS OF THIS MEASURE. THEIR SHORT IS SIXTY AND NINETY DAYS  JUST MET WITH SOME HOUSING ADVOCATES THE OTHER DAY THAT WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF TIMELINE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT. FOR LAND GIVEN SOME TO BUT THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES IT IS NOT FAST ENOUGH. HOW WILL WE GET THE GET NECESSARY CERTIFICATES OF OCCUPANCY ON THE GROUND TO PUT PEOPLE WHETHER IT'S SUPPORT OF HOUSING OR WHETHER IT'S AT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THE LIKE? THERE ARE SEEK WEB ELEMENTS IN THIS MEASURE WHICH I SAW THAT WERE THE CITIES AND COUNTIES IN STATE OWNED LAND WE CAN MOVE PAST THAT SMART IDEA TOUGH MEDICINE. IT'S ALL I SUGGES IS THAT WE DEBATE THIS YEAR TODAY. I THINK IT'S TO CELEBRATE THE IMPORTANT EFFORT AND THE EXTENSIVE EFFORT AMOUNT OF RESOURCES. BUT I TELL YOU THAT IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT I REPRESENT PEOPLE ARE FRUSTRATED WE'VE GOT TO MOVE HARDER WE GOT TO WORK HARDER WE GOT TO MOVE FASTER. I SUGGESTED I VOTE ON THIS MISSION. THANK YOU CENTER HERTZBERG CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU AYE MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS. I STAND IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. BUT I WANT TO RAISE ONE ISSUE WHICH SOMEWHAT FOLLOWS MY CALLING FROM THE FAMILY VALLEY'S COMMENTS -- WE HAVE IN THE BILL WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT AND VERY GOOD. LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ALLOW. THE ON CONTINUUM'S OF CARE THE COUNTIES THE CITIES TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS. THE MONEY THAT WE ARE PROVIDING FOR HOMELESSNESS. FOR SERVICES TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS. AND WE EVEN SPECIFIED IN THE BILL. THINGS LIKE EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE LEGAL ASSISTANCE SUCH THINGS LIKE THAT. YET OTHER PARTS OF THE BILL NEROLI DEFINE. THE POPULATION FOR WHOM THIS MONEY CONCERT. AND IT BASICALLY THE NARROW DEFINITION IS BASED ON A FEDERAL DEFINITION. WHICH STATES THAT THE PEOPLE MUST ALREADY BE HOMELESS. FOR AT RISK OF BEING HOMELESS WITHIN FOURTEEN DAYS SO THEY LITERALLY IT'S FOURTEEN DAYS AND THEY WILL HAVE NO ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD. NOW IN MY COUNTY ALAMEDA COUNTY AND I KNOW. MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES CAN STAND UP INSIDE THEIR PERCENTAGE NUMBERS I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBER IN FRONT OF ME FOR LOS ANGELES COUNTY BUT NO IS VERY SIGNIFICANT [inaudible] ALAMEDA COUNTY. OVER TWO YEARS. TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS IN OUR HOMELESS POPULATION COUNT. GREW. BY 47%. 47% [inaudible] SO. THIS IS A GREAT. MOVE THAT WERE MAKING TO PROVIDE SOME SUPPORT. FOR HOMELESS POPULATION BUT IF WE CONTINUE TO HAVE GROWTH LIKE THAT. THERE'S NO WAY. THAT WE CAN SERVE THE POPULATION. THE ONLY BE. ESSENTIAL THING TO DO. IS TO MAKE INTERVENTIONS BEFORE PEOPLE BECOME HOMELESS. THE OTHER DATA [inaudible] THAT. LOS ANGELES SAN FRANCISCO ALAMEDA COUNTY. HAVE SHOWN OVER THE LAST FORTY FIVE YEARS. IS THAT THIS GROWTH IN HOMELESS A SIGNIFICANT PERCENT. OF THESE PEOPLE. THAT ARE NOW HOMELESS. WE'RE NEVER HOMELESS BEFORE. SO THEY WERE HOUSED. THEY HAVE JOBS. THEY'RE NOT MENTALLY ILL. THEY ARE NOT ADDICTED MANY HAVE FAMILIES [inaudible] BUT THEY FACE ANY NUMBER OF CIRCUMSTANCES WITH OUR HIGH HIGH COST OF HOUSING. THAT PUT THEM IN THE POSITION. OF EITHER BEING A VICTIM OR THREATENED WITH EVICTION NOW MANY PEOPLE AND IN READ THE BOOK AFFECTED OR ASK YOUR OWN COUNTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. MANY PEOPLE WILL LEAVE THEIR HOUSING. AND BECOME HOMELESS BEFORE THEY ARE AFFECTED JUST TO PREVENT HAVING AN EVICTION. ON THEIR CREDIT REPORT BECAUSE ONCE YOU HAVE AN EVICTION IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. TO THEN FIND SOMEONE WHO WILL READ TO YOU. SO THEY IT YOU DON'T HAVE IF WE LIMIT. OUR ABILITY TO ASSESS TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS TO ONLY THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE WITHIN FOURTEEN DAYS. IT IS BOTH TO NARAL THE WINDOW TO REALLY HELP THEM. AND TO NEAR OVERPOPULATION. TO PREVENT THIS INCREDIBLE RISE IN HOMELESSNESS AND IT IS FAR MORE AFFORDABLE. TO KEEP PEOPLE WHO ARE HOUSED IN THEIR PLACES. WITH THE ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD THEN TO ONCE THEY BECOME HOMELESS GET THEM HOUSE. SO I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO WHEN WE RETURN IN AUGUST THAT THERE IS SOME CLEAN UP LANGUAGE. THAT HELPS CLEAR FI SO THAT THOSE ENTITIES THAT APPLY FOR THIS FUNDING HAVE THE APPROPRIATE FLEXIBILITY AS THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL SEEMS TO INTENT. TO REALLY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME. HOMELESS PREVENTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI THANK YOU MA'AM PRESENT I'LL BE SHORT I JUST WANTED. TO REMIND MEMBERS ABOUT THE REQUIREMENT THAT CITIES ALREADY HAVE TO HAVE THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATED EVERY. FOR AT LEAST EIGHT YEARS MAYBE FIVE YEARS AND THAT IT THE LAW ALL ALREADY ALLOWS STATE HOUSING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT THREE FOR CASE OVER -- TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IT IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL -- PROVIDE SOME FAIRNESS ADDITIONAL FAIRNESS SO NOW THAT EIGHT EIGHT CD IS GOING TO EITHER TELEPHONE OR MEET WITH THE CITY THAT HCD DOESN'T HINK THAT THEY'RE COMPLYING WITH THEIR BACK HOUSING ELEMENT AND PROVIDE THEM IN WRITING EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. THE CHANGES THAT THEY NEED TO COULD TAKE WHICH ISN'T ANOTHER BITE AT THE APPLE IF YOU WILL THEN IF THEY DON'T COMPLY THEN WE REFERRED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO WILL GOING. TO COURT TO SEEK SOME REMEDIES BUT HAVE THE COURT THE TERM THE JUDGE DETERMINE INDEPENDENTLY WITH A SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLY SO ONE WOULD. ANTICIPATE THAT THERE MAY BE EIGHT C. D. THE COURT SAYING THAT YOU ARE IN COMPLIANCE BOARD EIGHTY WHAT THE COURT SAYING NO EIGHT CD IS RIGHT YOU'RE NOT A COMPLIANT BUT EVEN AFTER THAT IN THE BOND AND SERVE FAIRNESS. IT GIVES THE CITY'S ANOTHER YEAR BEFORE ALL THESE FINE START CLICKING AND THEY THEY MAKE THAT DETERMINATION SO IT'S NOBODY I THINK SHE SHOULD BE CAUGHT OFF. ARE OFF -- HAND NOT KNOWING WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN BUT FINALLY I AM VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT THAT THE PROVISIONS THAT TALK ABOUT THE CAL HOME PROGRAM. IDENTIFYING EXCESS REACH WELLING UNITS AS A AS A EXCELLENT CANDIDATE FOR CITIES TO GIVE OUT LOANS TO AND SEEK AND SICK FUNDING FOR JUNIOR ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY REPRESENT WHAT THAT. ALERTS AND I'VE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER WHY KELSEY SENATOR ALSO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY THERE ARE SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS. THAT HEY WHAT'S REFERRED TO AS SEVERELY OVER BURDENED. QUANTITIES A RENT. PERCENTAGE OF RENT OF THEIR INCOME SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS. THAT ARE AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM BERKELEY SAID. THEY ARE THE PRE HOMELESS. THERE THE PRE HOMELESS. THEY ARE NOT AS SHE SAID. INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES OR WHO NEED SKILLS TO BE GAINFULLY EMPLOYED. THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE FORCED INTO LIVING IN THEIR CARS. OR SOMEONE ELSE'S SO FAR OR WORST ON THE STREETS OR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE JOBS. MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS DON'T GET PAID ENOUGH. TO PAY THE RENT IF WE SUPPORT THAT THEY SHOULD BE PAYING THOSE RENTS THAT'LL MAKE ENOUGH. AND THE RENT IS TOO HIGH. TEACHERS LIVING IN THEIR CARS AND STUDENTS ARE WORKING. AND THEY ARE PAYING THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO PAY THE RENT. SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT. THIS CONVERSATION IS I TOTALLY AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES WHO SPOKE IN SUPPORT AND I WILL SUPPORT AND VOTE THIS. FOR THIS BILL NO DOUBT ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT'S A DRESSING TWO KEY COMPONENTS. BUT THE OTHER KEY COMPONENT IS WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THE CONTINUING MASSIVE NUMBER OF THE VIC SHINS. THAT ARE FORCING MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN INTO THE STREETS. BUILDING LOW INCOME HOUSING IS SO IMPORTANT. BUT THE REASON WE WANT LOW INCOME HOUSING IS BECAUSE THOSE FAMILIES ARE HAVING A LOW INCOME. SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT THAT. THIS IS A BROTHERS I'M GOING TO KEEP USING THIS NUMBER OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. SEVERELY PAYING SEVERELY OVER BURDENED RENTS. WE SHOULD NOT BE STUNNED OR SHOCKED. BUT THE CONTINUING NUMBER OF HOMELESS IF WE IGNORE. FAMILIES LIKE THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR DRAWS SO SEE NO FURTHER DISCUSSION. SORRY CENTER MORLOCK PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MAYOR PRESIDENT I'M ALSO -- IN SUPPORT OF AB ONE A ONE IN. ONE OF THANK THE GOVERNOR. FOR THE ABILITY TO INTEGRATE NO PLACE LIKE HOME THE TWO BILLION DOLLAR. FUNDING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO IMPLEMENT AS A RESULT -- PROPOSITION -- TWO BECAUSE A BIG COMPOUND OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION AS INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE MENTALLY ILL AND THEY'RE ALSO GRAVELY DISABLED AND CAN'T EVEN TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES. SO IF WE COULD -- FURTHER SOME SUPPORT OF HOUSING THAT WOULD BE A POSITIVE THING. WE SHOULD ALSO BE LOOKING AT WHAT WE DO WITH THOSE THAT CANNOT TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES. AND WHETHER WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT WHETHER IT'S ALL VOLUNTARY HOUSING OR MAYBE A COMPONENT OF INVOLUNTARY HOUSING MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO HELP THESE PEOPLE GET BACK.
