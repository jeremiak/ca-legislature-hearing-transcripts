00:07:32.685 --> 00:07:36.122
BURNING HOME THAT CAN NO LONGER

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:37.056
DO THAT. THIS FLEXIBILITY IS

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:38.257
JUST ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO

00:07:38.324 --> 00:07:40.526
PROGRAM SUCCESSES AND WE NEED TO

00:07:40.593 --> 00:07:42.628
LOOK NO FURTHER THAN WHAT WE'RE

00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:44.330
IN THE MIDDLE OF RIGHT NOW IN

00:07:44.397 --> 00:07:46.299
TERMS OF NEEDING TO ADJUST

00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:46.933
PROGRAMS AND THAT'S THINGS LIKE

00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:50.903
THE KOBE. AND THE CODE OVER.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.739
THEM THANK IS SUPER EASY IT IS.

00:07:53.806 --> 00:07:55.208
A DIFFERENT PANDEMIC THAT WE

00:07:55.274 --> 00:07:57.276
DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT ABOUT SENIOR

00:07:57.343 --> 00:07:59.612
SERVICES AND THAT IS LONELINESS

00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:01.013
AND ISOLATION LONELINESS AND

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.682
ISOLATION IN OLDER ADULTS WAS

00:08:02.748 --> 00:08:05.017
ALREADY AT A CRITICAL STAGE WE

00:08:05.084 --> 00:08:06.786
CODE HERE. AND WHILE I DON'T

00:08:06.853 --> 00:08:08.721
WANT TO REPEAT THE HEALTH

00:08:08.788 --> 00:08:10.957
IMPACTS AND THE DEATHS THAT KOBE

00:08:11.023 --> 00:08:15.761
YEAH. ALL OF US HAVE HEARD

00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:16.796
THOSE. THIS NUMBERS FOR OLD

00:08:16.863 --> 00:08:18.865
ROAD. WHEN WANT TO FILE WHAT IT

00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:20.333
DID TO ISOLATION AND ENGAGEMENT

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:22.869
OF SENIORS IN THAT IS THAT A

00:08:22.935 --> 00:08:24.704
POPULATION THAT ALREADY WASN'T

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.573
CONNECTING. DRIVEN FURTHER INTO

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.141
COPPER AND FURTHER

00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:30.343
DISENFRANCHISE FROM THE

00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:32.879
COMMUNITY AT ALL. AND NO PLACES

00:08:32.945 --> 00:08:34.347
THAT SCENE BETTER THAN

00:08:34.413 --> 00:08:36.515
VOLUNTEERS. AND WE ALSO HAVE

00:08:36.582 --> 00:08:38.417
KNOWN AND STUDIES SHOW THAT

00:08:38.484 --> 00:08:41.320
NOTHING COUNTERS ISOLATION OR

00:08:41.387 --> 00:08:42.822
LONELINESS BETTER THAN

00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:45.224
VOLUNTEER. THAT'S THE ULTIMATE

00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:47.660
CURE FOR BEING SOCIALLY ISOLATED

00:08:47.727 --> 00:08:49.262
OR NOT ENGAGE OR KEEPING ONE'S

00:08:49.328 --> 00:08:52.298
MINE SHAR SO I HAD A TIME WHEN

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:54.734
PROGRAMS. ARE WHEN THE DEMAND

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.902
FOR THEIR SERVICES ARE GREATER

00:08:55.968 --> 00:08:58.571
THAN EVER. AND WHEN SERVICES ARE

00:08:58.638 --> 00:09:00.907
STATUTORILY REQUIRED LIKE TAX

00:09:00.973 --> 00:09:02.642
ACCOUNTING FOR THE ELDERLY. OR

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:03.743
HEALTH INSURANCE MEDICARE

00:09:03.809 --> 00:09:06.612
NAVIGATION THE REQUIRED TO USE

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:07.580
HIGHLY TRAINED PROFESSIONAL

00:09:07.647 --> 00:09:11.784
LEVELS ARE. VOLUNTEERS TO

00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:13.352
PERFORM THEIR WORK. SUDDENLY ALL

00:09:13.419 --> 00:09:15.087
THESE VITAL VOLUNTEERS AREN'T

00:09:15.154 --> 00:09:17.223
ABLE TO VOLUNTEER FOR THEIR OWN

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:19.625
SAFETY SO WE END UP WITH THE

00:09:19.692 --> 00:09:21.961
DOUBLE WHAMMY IN AND WE'VE HEARD

00:09:22.028 --> 00:09:23.329
STORIES- SOME DOCUMENTED ABOUT

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:25.364
PROGRAMS LIKE- BUT IT'S BEEN THE

00:09:25.431 --> 00:09:27.800
SAME FORTY TO FIFTY PERCENT. OF

00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:29.502
THE VOLUNTEER WORK FORCE-

00:09:29.568 --> 00:09:31.504
LOCALLY ONE OF OUR AGENCIES ONE

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:32.939
OF OUR FAVORITE PROGRAMS USES

00:09:33.005 --> 00:09:35.141
VOLUNTEERS THE MINOR HOME

00:09:35.207 --> 00:09:37.510
REPAIRS THEY'VE HAD TO SHUT DOWN

00:09:37.576 --> 00:09:38.911
BECAUSE THEY'RE RETIRED

00:09:38.978 --> 00:09:40.880
CONTRACTORS THAT DID THIS WORK

00:09:40.947 --> 00:09:43.115
NO LONGER COULD SAFELY. SO THE

00:09:43.182 --> 00:09:45.418
VOLUNTEER PROGRAM PROPOSAL IS AN

00:09:45.484 --> 00:09:47.353
EFFORT TO COORDINATE THAT EFFORT

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.288
TO BRING BACK VOLUNTEERS AND

00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:52.692
CONNECT THEM WITH THESE CRITICAL

00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:55.428
SERVICES. BUT IT'S TRULY THE

00:09:55.494 --> 00:09:58.931
ULTIMATE SOLUTION AND BASS. FOR

00:09:58.998 --> 00:10:00.866
FEARING KNOWN AS AN ISOLATION

00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:02.969
IT'S ALSO BEEN SHOWN THAT THE

00:10:03.035 --> 00:10:04.136
VOLUNTEERS BENEFIT MORE FROM

00:10:04.203 --> 00:10:06.605
VOLUNTEERING ON AVERAGE THAN THE

00:10:06.672 --> 00:10:07.873
PEOPLE THAT RECEIVE THEIR

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.309
SERVICES. SO WE'RE URGING ON

00:10:10.376 --> 00:10:12.278
BOTH THESE THOSE THINGS TO BE

00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:13.913
FOUND. ON THE DISCUSSION TODAY

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.749
DOESN'T INCLUDE FOOD BUT IN MANY

00:10:16.816 --> 00:10:18.784
WAYS OUR PROPOSAL FOR MEALS IS

00:10:18.851 --> 00:10:20.519
PART OF A RESTORATION EFFORT

00:10:20.586 --> 00:10:22.955
ALSO WE KNOW A LOT OF MONEY FLOW

00:10:23.022 --> 00:10:25.691
FORWARD WITH KOBE. AND FOOD

00:10:25.758 --> 00:10:27.593
PROGRAMS NUTRITION PROGRAMS HOME

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.562
DELIVERED MEALS WAS ONE OF THE

00:10:29.628 --> 00:10:31.130
GREAT BENEFICIARIES IN

00:10:31.197 --> 00:10:34.033
CALIFORNIA HOWEVER THOSE FEDERAL

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.868
DOLLARS ARE GOING TO DRY OUT.

00:10:35.935 --> 00:10:37.770
AND WHEN THEY DRY OUT THE

00:10:37.837 --> 00:10:39.972
SENIORS RECEIVING THESE MEALS

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:40.973
FOR GOING TO BE JUST AS HUNGRY

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.675
AS EVER THEY'RE GOING TO NEED

00:10:42.742 --> 00:10:44.977
JUST AS MUCH TO ME AS THEY EVER

00:10:45.044 --> 00:10:47.413
HAVE. SO WE'RE HOPING THAT THE

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.148
AUGMENTIN FUNDING ASK FOR

00:10:49.215 --> 00:10:51.817
NUTRITION AND BACK FILLED OUT

00:10:51.884 --> 00:10:53.986
FOR THAT'S ABOUT TO BE CREATED

00:10:54.053 --> 00:10:56.989
AND ALSO. ADDRESS THE UNMET

00:10:57.056 --> 00:11:02.128
HUNGER NEEDS. IN OLDER ADULTS

00:11:02.194 --> 00:11:03.896
THAT ALREADY EXISTS. SO WHERE

00:11:03.963 --> 00:11:05.664
PROPOSED THIS MULTI. A BUDGET

00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:08.067
AUGMENTATION AS OUR IDEA FOR THE

00:11:08.134 --> 00:11:10.503
BEST FIRST STEPS FOR MASTER PLAN

00:11:10.569 --> 00:11:12.471
FOR AGING OBVIOUSLY THERE'S MANY

00:11:12.538 --> 00:11:14.740
COMPONENTS TO IT BUT STARTING

00:11:14.807 --> 00:11:16.675
WHERE WE LEFT OFF WHERE WE HAD

00:11:16.742 --> 00:11:18.577
SUCCESS SEEMS LIKE A VERY GOOD

00:11:18.644 --> 00:11:20.312
STARTING POINT. AND I JUST WANT

00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:22.415
TO CLOSE WITH JUST A COUPLE

00:11:22.481 --> 00:11:25.851
BLOCKS ONE SAYING THAT FOR YEARS

00:11:25.918 --> 00:11:26.986
ONE OF OUR TALKING POINTS HAS

00:11:27.053 --> 00:11:30.723
BEEN WE NEED TO ENGAGE. AN

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.826
INCREASE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT

00:11:33.893 --> 00:11:36.395
OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH

00:11:36.462 --> 00:11:38.397
DISABILITIES WE NEED TO ELEVATE

00:11:38.464 --> 00:11:40.099
THAT CONVERSATION AND WE HAVE

00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:41.467
DONE IT WE SHOULD ALL CELEBRATE

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:42.601
THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS

00:11:42.668 --> 00:11:44.437
DISCUSSION TODAY COMMITTEE

00:11:44.503 --> 00:11:45.905
MEMBERS AND MEMBERS THROUGHOUT

00:11:45.971 --> 00:11:47.873
THE LEGISLATURE NO AGING ISSUES

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.008
BETTER THAN THEY EVER HAVE

00:11:49.075 --> 00:11:51.744
BEFORE SO WE HAVE THAT SUCCESS

00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:53.879
BUT UNFORTUNATELY OUR TRUE WORK

00:11:53.946 --> 00:11:56.148
STARTS NOW BECAUSE THE CHALLENGE

00:11:56.215 --> 00:11:59.151
ISN'T REALLY THIS ELEVATE THE

00:11:59.218 --> 00:12:00.052
CONVERSATION. THE CHALLENGE WE

00:12:00.119 --> 00:12:02.021
NEED IS TO ELEVATE THE

00:12:02.088 --> 00:12:05.124
ENGAGEMENT IN L. E. INVESTMENT

00:12:05.191 --> 00:12:05.825
IN OLDER ADULTS IN ADULT

00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:08.260
SERVICES SO WE HUMBLY SUBMIT

00:12:08.327 --> 00:12:09.528
THIS PROPOSAL FOR YOUR

00:12:09.595 --> 00:12:11.230
CONSIDERATION ASKING FOR YOUR

00:12:11.297 --> 00:12:13.833
SUPPORT AND IF THERE'S ANY

00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:15.734
QUESTIONS OR FOLLOW QUESTIONS

00:12:15.801 --> 00:12:17.603
YOU'D LIKE TO MEET ME TO ADDRESS

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.405
THE HAPPY TO ATTEMPT TO DO SO

00:12:19.472 --> 00:12:20.873
THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.175
CAMPERO YOUR YOUR DEDICATION AND

00:12:23.242 --> 00:12:25.744
YOUR ENTHUSIASM. CERTAINLY COMES

00:12:25.811 --> 00:12:32.118
THROUGH- SO. HOW MUCH. HOW MUCH

00:12:32.184 --> 00:12:33.486
MORE IS TO PRESENT WESTERN

00:12:33.552 --> 00:12:34.954
ANYTHING NEW WE'RE JUST GOING TO

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.522
CONTINUE TO FUND WHAT WE'VE BEEN

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.491
FUNDING AT A AT HIGHER LEVELS.

00:12:38.557 --> 00:12:40.493
SO HOW MUCH MORE WILL WE BE ABLE

00:12:40.559 --> 00:12:43.062
TO DO AND IS THIS IS A- BUDGET

00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:45.231
PROPOSAL CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE

00:12:45.297 --> 00:12:46.732
BIT ABOUT WE WANT TO BE AS

00:12:46.799 --> 00:12:48.367
FLEXIBLE AS POSSIBLE. BUT HOW DO

00:12:48.434 --> 00:12:51.737
WE ALSO THEN WORK IN- SWING WHN

00:12:51.804 --> 00:12:54.373
SO LIKE SANTA CRUZ. DO THEY FEEL

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.342
BECAUSE WELL ABOUT THE PROGRAMS

00:12:56.408 --> 00:12:57.977
AS AS PEOPLE DO AND SAN BENITO

00:12:58.043 --> 00:12:59.912
COUNTIES AND HOW DO WE KNOW OF

00:12:59.979 --> 00:13:02.181
HOW DO WE KNOW THOSE RESOURCES.

00:13:02.248 --> 00:13:06.552
ARE ADEQUATELY AND- A FAIRLY

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:08.387
DISTRIBUTED. YEAH THAT'S A GREAT

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:11.323
A GREAT QUESTION- I THINK PART

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.425
OF HOW WE DO THAT IS THAT. IS

00:13:13.492 --> 00:13:15.461
MAKING SURE THE TRIPLE A.'S

00:13:15.528 --> 00:13:18.497
PROVIDE ANNUAL QUARTERLY EVEN

00:13:18.564 --> 00:13:20.065
MONTHLY UPDATES AS TO WHAT

00:13:20.132 --> 00:13:21.500
THEY'RE DOING WITH THE DOLLARS.

00:13:21.567 --> 00:13:23.736
AND FOR PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING

00:13:23.802 --> 00:13:25.971
AUGMENTED THAT EXIST THAT'S

00:13:26.038 --> 00:13:27.806
REALLY EASY TO DO THAT

00:13:27.873 --> 00:13:30.075
INFRASTRUCTURE ALREADY SET. FOR

00:13:30.142 --> 00:13:31.844
THE PROGRAMS I'VE BEEN GONE FOR

00:13:31.911 --> 00:13:34.079
A DECADE CLASS THAT WOULD HAVE

00:13:34.146 --> 00:13:36.515
TO BE REINVIGORATED BUT AGAIN.

00:13:36.582 --> 00:13:38.551
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE DID. BACK

00:13:38.617 --> 00:13:41.253
IN TWO THOUSAND NINE BACK IN TWO

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.788
THOUSAND WITH GREAT SUCCESS SO I

00:13:42.855 --> 00:13:44.823
THINK ACCOUNTABILITY IS A KEY

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.459
PART OF THIS. SHOWING THE IMPACT

00:13:47.526 --> 00:13:48.794
THAT WE HAVE ON INDIVIDUALS

00:13:48.861 --> 00:13:50.629
RECEIVING THE DOLLARS AND HOW

00:13:50.696 --> 00:13:52.765
THE DOLLARS ARE. ARE MATCH WITH

00:13:52.831 --> 00:13:55.067
NUTRITION IT'S EASY WE CAN

00:13:55.134 --> 00:13:56.702
EQUATE THAT SEVENTY MILLION

00:13:56.769 --> 00:13:58.737
DOLLARS WILL RESULT IN ABOUT

00:13:58.804 --> 00:14:00.506
SEVEN MILLION MEALS. FOR SOME OF

00:14:00.573 --> 00:14:03.943
THESE OTHERS IT'S TRICKIER IN

00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:05.277
THAT. GIVEN THE FLEXIBILITY

00:14:05.344 --> 00:14:07.146
WHICH WE ALL LIVE IT'S HARD TO

00:14:07.213 --> 00:14:09.615
PREDICT SERVICE UNITS BECAUSE

00:14:09.682 --> 00:14:11.750
PROVIDING LEGAL SERVICES WHILE

00:14:11.817 --> 00:14:15.821
IT MAY HAVE A TEN HUNDRED OR A

00:14:15.888 --> 00:14:16.455
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR IMPACT.

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:18.524
ON AN INDIVIDUAL THAT MIGHT ONLY

00:14:18.591 --> 00:14:20.459
BE ONE SERVICE UNIT THAT GETS

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:21.961
THERE IT'S OBVIOUSLY IT'S MORE

00:14:22.027 --> 00:14:24.296
EXPENSIVE. TO PROVIDE SOMETHING

00:14:24.363 --> 00:14:26.565
LIKE AND LEGAL ASSISTANCE THAT

00:14:26.632 --> 00:14:28.834
IS TO DELIVER A BAG OF GROCERIES

00:14:28.901 --> 00:14:30.669
TO SOMEONE'S HOUSE. SO WHEN I

00:14:30.736 --> 00:14:32.638
WAS PUTTING THIS TOGETHER I WAS

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:33.505
THINKING ABOUT THAT HOW DO WE

00:14:33.572 --> 00:14:36.342
PUT. NUMERALS YOU KNOW HAVE A

00:14:36.408 --> 00:14:37.610
BUTTON WIDGET NUMBERS TO EACH

00:14:37.676 --> 00:14:40.246
PART OF THIS PROPOSAL AND UNTIL

00:14:40.312 --> 00:14:42.248
THOSE LOCAL DECISIONS ARE MADE I

00:14:42.314 --> 00:14:43.616
DON'T THINK WE CAN ACCURATELY

00:14:43.682 --> 00:14:45.784
PREDICTS. WHAT THE TOTAL

00:14:45.851 --> 00:14:47.786
SERVICES BETTER I THINK WE COULD

00:14:47.853 --> 00:14:49.855
LOOK AT COST PER UNIT IN THE IN

00:14:49.922 --> 00:14:51.757
THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES AND

00:14:51.824 --> 00:14:52.891
COME UP WITH SOME SORT OF

00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.461
ESTIMATE. ARE PROBABLY BE MORE

00:14:55.527 --> 00:14:57.563
UNPRODUCTIVE TO LOOK AT WHAT WAS

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:00.199
DONE A DECADE OR MORE AGO AND

00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:02.201
THEN DOUBLE THE COST SIMPLY

00:15:02.268 --> 00:15:04.236
BECAUSE INFLATION IS COPPER BABY

00:15:04.303 --> 00:15:05.771
DOUBLE THE IMPACT AT THE SAME

00:15:05.838 --> 00:15:08.040
TIME. I'M VOLUNTEERS AND I DO

00:15:08.107 --> 00:15:09.341
HAVE SOME IDEAS ABOUT THAT

00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:11.977
BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE WAYS

00:15:12.044 --> 00:15:12.578
WE CAN MEASURE POLICY. BOUNCE

00:15:12.645 --> 00:15:14.713
HERE ISM IS THE VALUE OF THE

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.216
TIME DEDICATE. SO NUMBER OF

00:15:17.283 --> 00:15:19.685
VOLUNTEERS IS ONE THING. BUT THE

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:22.054
WORK THE VOLUNTEERS STATUS CAN'T

00:15:22.121 --> 00:15:23.889
BE MEASURED AND THERE ARE- TAX

00:15:23.956 --> 00:15:26.158
GUIDELINES TO DO THIS THAT

00:15:26.225 --> 00:15:27.593
SOMEBODY IS A VOLUNTEER TAX

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.328
PREPARER FOR EXAMPLE THAT'S

00:15:29.395 --> 00:15:31.697
ESTIMATED AS A TWENTY FIVE

00:15:31.764 --> 00:15:34.333
DOLLAR FOR OUR- VALUES. WERE IS

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:35.901
IF SOMEBODY IS JUST DOING

00:15:35.968 --> 00:15:38.704
OFFICE. WORK AND MAILING OUT

00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:40.873
ENVELOPES OR NOTICES THAT WOULD

00:15:40.939 --> 00:15:42.741
BE MORE THAN THE MINIMUM WAGE

00:15:42.808 --> 00:15:44.143
CATEGORY SO I THINK THAT MIGHT

00:15:44.209 --> 00:15:46.445
BE REALLY INTERESTING. TOOL TO

00:15:46.512 --> 00:15:48.747
LOOK AT THE SUCCESS IS MEASURING

00:15:48.814 --> 00:15:49.548
NOT JUST THE NUMBER OF

00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:56.989

00:15:57.056 --> 00:15:58.023

00:59:39.175 --> 00:59:40.977
DEPARTMENT INFORMATION.

00:59:41.044 --> 00:59:42.712
TECHNOLOGY GROUPS DEVELOP A FLAT

00:59:42.779 --> 00:59:44.480
FILE FOR EXAMPLE THAT CASSIDY

00:59:44.547 --> 00:59:47.250
ABSOLUTELY TO THE SCO THE MAIN.

00:59:47.317 --> 00:59:49.886
MAINFRAME FOR AUDITS THE PROJECT

00:59:49.953 --> 00:59:51.487
COST FOR THIS EACH OF THESE

00:59:51.554 --> 00:59:53.523
IMPLEMENTATIONS IS ABOUT SIXTY

00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:55.325
FIVE K. AND COST OF ONGOING

00:59:55.391 --> 00:59:57.794
AUDITS. EACH IMPLEMENTATION

00:59:57.860 --> 00:59:59.862
COULD TAKE- I'M ABOUT NINE

00:59:59.929 --> 01:00:01.965
MONTHS OR SO THE MINIMUM TO GET

01:00:02.031 --> 01:00:04.934
THIS GOING. A MINUTE AND TURN IT

01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:07.136
OVER TO BRIAN TO LET THAT BE

01:00:07.203 --> 01:00:08.338
DIRECTOR OF THE RESEARCH AND

01:00:08.404 --> 01:00:11.007
AUTOMATIC AND DATA DIVISION TO

01:00:11.074 --> 01:00:16.612
FIGHT. TO THE NEXT COUPLE

01:00:16.679 --> 01:00:18.014
QUESTIONS. THANK YOU LOU BAY ARE

01:00:18.081 --> 01:00:19.649
LET OF FROM THE RESEARCH ARMY

01:00:19.716 --> 01:00:21.718
AND DATA DEBATE- SO I'M GOING TO

01:00:21.784 --> 01:00:25.088
RESPOND TO QUESTIONS FOR- ABOUT.

01:00:25.154 --> 01:00:26.489
THE NEED FOR THE INTERAGENCY

01:00:26.556 --> 01:00:28.491
AGREEMENT IN THE TIMELINE FOR

01:00:28.558 --> 01:00:31.327
THE EXISTING CITY SYSTEMS- AND-

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:34.564
SO THE COW STARK SOLUTION- HAS

01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:35.631
THREE COMPONENTS THAT ARE BEING

01:00:35.698 --> 01:00:37.433
DEVELOPED CONCURRENTLY BUT MAY

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:38.668
HAVE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

01:00:38.735 --> 01:00:40.203
TIMELINES THE FIRST CONSISTENT

01:00:40.269 --> 01:00:41.371
COMPONENT IS A CONSUMER

01:00:41.437 --> 01:00:43.206
EDUCATION TOOL THAT WILL LAUNCH.

01:00:43.272 --> 01:00:45.108
AN INITIAL VERSION THIS SUMMER.

01:00:45.174 --> 01:00:46.509
THE SECOND COMPONENT IS THE

01:00:46.576 --> 01:00:48.044
ENTERPRISE DATA INFRASTRUCTURE

01:00:48.111 --> 01:00:49.946
THAT WILL GOVERN HOW DATA FLOWS

01:00:50.013 --> 01:00:51.347
WITHIN THE CHILD CARE LANDSCAPE

01:00:51.414 --> 01:00:53.816
IN BETWEEN OTHER PROGRAM AREAS.

01:00:53.883 --> 01:00:55.418
WE HAVE ENOUGH IN INITIAL

01:00:55.485 --> 01:01:01.057
FRAMEWORK FOR THIS FUNCTIONALITY. HELLO THE OTHER COMPONENTS.

01:01:01.124 --> 01:01:02.458
THE THIRD COMPONENT OUT OF FROM

01:01:02.525 --> 01:01:04.494
OF TELLS WILL FOCUS ON THE DATA

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:05.595
COLLECTION ADMINISTRATIVE

01:01:05.661 --> 01:01:06.863
BUSINESS PROCESS SEEKS TO

01:01:06.929 --> 01:01:08.297
REPLACE THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE

01:01:08.364 --> 01:01:11.067
EXISTING CITY LEGACY SYSTEMS.

01:01:11.134 --> 01:01:13.202
YES IS CURRENTLY IN STAGE TO THE

01:01:13.269 --> 01:01:15.271
ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS PHASE OF

01:01:15.338 --> 01:01:16.906
THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE

01:01:16.973 --> 01:01:18.674
FOR THE CALIFORNIA SOLUTION. YES

01:01:18.741 --> 01:01:19.609
THAT'S THE CONTRACTED WITH

01:01:19.675 --> 01:01:21.310
ACCENTURE TO HELP WITH BUSINESS

01:01:21.377 --> 01:01:22.478
DISCOVERY AND PRODUCE THE

01:01:22.545 --> 01:01:23.513
REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION TO

01:01:23.579 --> 01:01:24.380
CAPTURE THE BUSINESS

01:01:24.447 --> 01:01:25.915
REQUIREMENTS WHILE WE ARE STILL

01:01:25.982 --> 01:01:27.483
FINALIZING THE WORK PLAN BUT THE

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:30.186
CENTER. WE EXPECT THAT THIS

01:01:30.253 --> 01:01:30.720
PROCESS WILL BE COMPLETED

01:01:30.787 --> 01:01:32.688
SOMETIME IN Q. THREE OF STATE

01:01:32.755 --> 01:01:34.624
FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY

01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:37.260
THREE. AND SUBMIT AS TO A- TO

01:01:37.326 --> 01:01:39.896
SEE AT FORK WILL THAT TIME. AT

01:01:39.962 --> 01:01:41.464
THAT POINT WE WILL BE ABLE TO

01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:43.232
PROVIDE A BETTER ESTIMATE OF THE

01:01:43.299 --> 01:01:44.734
REMAINING TIME LINE BUT THE NEXT

01:01:44.801 --> 01:01:46.969
STEPS WILL BE COMPLETION OF THE

01:01:47.036 --> 01:01:48.538
PRODUCT OF A LIFE CYCLE AND

01:01:48.604 --> 01:01:50.106
RUNNING- PROCUREMENT TO IDENTIFY

01:01:50.173 --> 01:01:52.842
A SOLUTION- MEETING CSS IS T.

01:01:52.909 --> 01:01:54.410
ISN'T TECHNICAL NEEDS. AND THEN

01:01:54.477 --> 01:01:55.745
EXECUTING ON THAT PARTICULAR

01:01:55.812 --> 01:01:57.713
TRIP BY THE SOLUTION AND BRING A

01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:01.384
BETTER ON BOARD FOR THE DESIGN

01:02:01.451 --> 01:02:01.784
CONFIGURATION AND

01:02:01.851 --> 01:02:02.685
IMPLEMENTATION. WE ARE WORKING

01:02:02.752 --> 01:02:04.020
CLOSELY CDT AND- JAZZ TOGETHER

01:02:04.087 --> 01:02:05.121
TECHNICAL EXPERT. THROUGHOUT

01:02:05.188 --> 01:02:07.423
THIS PROCESS. AND IDENTIFY

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:09.258
OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPEDITE. THIS

01:02:09.325 --> 01:02:10.893
PRODUCT IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.695
THE DEPARTMENT I'M SO WE ARE WE

01:02:12.762 --> 01:02:13.596
CAN WORKING HARD TO MEET THE

01:02:13.663 --> 01:02:14.864
ESTABLISHED OUTLINES THE

01:02:14.931 --> 01:02:16.065
EXISTING CITY SYSTEMS ARE

01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:17.700
COMPLEX THE BILL THIS AFTER IS

01:02:17.767 --> 01:02:19.168
TO STAND UP A NEW SYSTEM

01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:20.169
LEVERAGING OFF THE SHELF

01:02:20.236 --> 01:02:21.471
SOLUTIONS WHEN POSSIBLE WHICH

01:02:21.537 --> 01:02:23.539
ALLOWS TO UNIFY THE ARCHITECTURE

01:02:23.606 --> 01:02:25.141
BUT ALSO RE ENGINEERING-

01:02:25.208 --> 01:02:26.909
EFFICIENT BUSINESS PROCESSES. AS

01:02:26.976 --> 01:02:28.578
A RESULT WE HAVE PLACED MORE

01:02:28.644 --> 01:02:29.745
EMPHASIS ON UP FRONT PLANNING

01:02:29.812 --> 01:02:32.448
WHICH WE ANTICIPATE WILL SAVE

01:02:32.515 --> 01:02:34.016
TIME ON THE BACK AND- WITH

01:02:34.083 --> 01:02:36.786
REGARDS TO- CONTINUING TO ACCESS

01:02:36.853 --> 01:02:38.821
THESE SYSTEMS. THE TIMELINE FOR

01:02:38.888 --> 01:02:40.022
THAT WILL DEPEND ON CHANGE

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:41.424
MANAGEMENT PROCESS HOW QUICKLY

01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:42.758
WE ARE ABLE TO GET USERS TO

01:02:42.825 --> 01:02:45.027
ADAPT AND PRACTICES. WE PLAN TO

01:02:45.094 --> 01:02:46.429
EXPLORE PHASE APPROACHES FOR

01:02:46.496 --> 01:02:47.864
ROLLOUT WHICH COULD MEAN THAT WE

01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:49.565
ATTAIN INDEPENDENCE PARTS OF THE

01:02:49.632 --> 01:02:51.134
CITY SYSTEMS ON DIFFERENT

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:51.968
TIMELINES. WE WILL ENGAGE WITH

01:02:52.034 --> 01:02:53.703
CD AS WE ASSESS WHAT IS MOST

01:02:53.769 --> 01:02:55.404
AFFECTED ARE TO ASSESS WHAT IS

01:02:55.471 --> 01:02:57.240
MOST EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT- OF

01:02:57.306 --> 01:02:58.975
THE SYSTEMS TO TRANSITION FIRST.

01:02:59.041 --> 01:03:01.844
FINALLY I WOULD NOTE- THAT IT IS

01:03:01.911 --> 01:03:03.346
OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT SEED

01:03:03.412 --> 01:03:04.981
INTENSELY CONTINUE TO USE THESE

01:03:05.047 --> 01:03:07.016
SYSTEMS FOR OTHER PROGRAMS THAT

01:03:07.083 --> 01:03:09.886
THEY RUN IT WAS NOT TRANSFERRED

01:03:09.952 --> 01:03:11.420
OVER TO CSS. AS PART OF HELP. WE

01:03:11.487 --> 01:03:13.523
WILL COME. THE COSTS OF THE

01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:15.625
PROGRAM TO THE STATUS QUO-

01:03:15.691 --> 01:03:17.493
MAINLY CONTINUING TO USE THE CD

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:19.262
SYSTEMS- TO THE ALTERNATIVE

01:03:19.328 --> 01:03:20.930
OPTIONS. THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE

01:03:20.997 --> 01:03:22.165
WITH THAT COMPARISON IS THAT

01:03:22.231 --> 01:03:23.499
CALIFORNIA WILL BE PROVIDING

01:03:23.566 --> 01:03:24.634
FUNCTIONALITY THAT IS NOT

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:26.068
CURRENTLY INCLUDED ARE POSSIBLE

01:03:26.135 --> 01:03:28.371
WITH THE EXISTING LEGACY SYSTEMS

01:03:28.437 --> 01:03:30.473
WHICH COULD MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:31.974
MORE DIFFICULT TO CONDUCT AN

01:03:32.041 --> 01:03:34.243
APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON.

01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:35.344
THERE IS ONE FINAL QUESTION

01:03:35.411 --> 01:03:37.046
REGARDING THE ONGOING COSTS AND

01:03:37.113 --> 01:03:39.215
THE CAL SPARK SOLUTION- AT THIS

01:03:39.282 --> 01:03:41.117
POINT WE DON'T HAVE AN ESTIMATE

01:03:41.184 --> 01:03:42.752
OF WHAT THOSE COSTS MIGHT BE.

01:03:42.818 --> 01:03:44.687
WONDERING COSTS WILL DEPEND ON

01:03:44.754 --> 01:03:45.688
THE SOLUTION THAT IS ULTIMATELY

01:03:45.755 --> 01:03:47.523
IDENTIFIED. WILL BE HAPPY TO
