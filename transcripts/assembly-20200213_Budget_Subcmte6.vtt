to the I know she had a very

00:07:18.571 --> 00:07:20.206
tight time frame so we were

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:22.675

homelessness and housing and

00:07:39.892 --> 00:07:40.459
the work that you continue to

00:07:40.526 --> 00:07:42.762
do- to leverage resources not

00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:48.935
complexities of the issue and

00:07:49.001 --> 00:07:50.770
our need. To do more on the

00:07:50.837 --> 00:07:52.138

00:08:06.252 --> 00:08:08.421
in San Francisco which has.

00:08:08.487 --> 00:08:10.223
Definitely made it more

00:08:10.289 --> 00:08:14.126
convenient. For me out by- so

00:08:14.193 --> 00:08:14.694
good morning everyone times

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.429
London for the mayor of San

00:08:16.495 --> 00:08:21.834
Francisco and- as we all know

00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:24.103
we've we've seen- throughout

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:24.670
not only San Francisco but

00:08:24.737 --> 00:08:26.405
throughout the state-

00:08:26.472 --> 00:08:28.241
homelessness is really taken

00:08:28.307 --> 00:08:30.142
front and center and has-

00:08:30.209 --> 00:08:32.144
played itself out on our

00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:34.180
streets in a way that- is

00:08:34.247 --> 00:08:37.083
something that as a- San

00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:39.485
Franciscan it as- San

00:08:39.552 --> 00:08:41.587
Francisco. And as someone seen

00:08:41.654 --> 00:08:44.757
homelessness- over the years to

00:08:44.824 --> 00:08:49.228
this magnitude not to since it.

00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:49.862
Is including an oak I know may

00:08:49.929 --> 00:08:53.633
shaft is here to test as well-

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:54.300
it is it is like nothing I've

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:58.804
ever seen before. In San

00:08:58.871 --> 00:09:00.740
Francisco alone we have over a

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:03.075
thousand people experiencing

00:09:03.142 --> 00:09:03.709
homelessness on any given night

00:09:03.776 --> 00:09:04.310
and five thousand people are

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:07.146
less. On shelter. It's every

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:09.582
night San Francisco provide

00:09:09.649 --> 00:09:14.186
shelter and housing to over

00:09:14.253 --> 00:09:14.820
thirteen thousand people and we

00:09:14.887 --> 00:09:16.522
have more permanent supportive

00:09:16.589 --> 00:09:19.292
housing per capita than any

00:09:19.358 --> 00:09:22.161
other major city in the United

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:24.263
States and still are citizens

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:24.931
are suffering. In fact over the

00:09:24.997 --> 00:09:30.937
past. Years. Sit homelessness

00:09:31.003 --> 00:09:32.605
and it doesn't even look like

00:09:32.672 --> 00:09:34.240
we scratch the surface. Every

00:09:34.307 --> 00:09:34.874
day when I walked the streets

00:09:34.941 --> 00:09:36.609
of the city I witnessed the

00:09:36.676 --> 00:09:38.411
suffering even on my way here

00:09:38.477 --> 00:09:40.279
to this hearing. The families

00:09:40.346 --> 00:09:42.548
hustling from the bus stops to

00:09:42.615 --> 00:09:44.083
the shelter the young adults

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.385
force to set up a tent on the

00:09:46.452 --> 00:09:50.489
sidewalk the veteran struggling

00:09:50.556 --> 00:09:53.059
to hold on to their dignity. It

00:09:53.125 --> 00:09:54.927
is really been challenging to

00:09:54.994 --> 00:09:57.530
witness and frustrating not to

00:09:57.596 --> 00:10:00.132
be able to move faster to deal

00:10:00.199 --> 00:10:01.334
with this crisis. I'm really

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.202
grateful again for this

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:03.836
committee and their leadership

00:10:03.903 --> 00:10:04.770
dedicating new state resources

00:10:04.837 --> 00:10:07.440
over the past two budget

00:10:07.506 --> 00:10:09.976
cycles. Cities and counties can

00:10:10.042 --> 00:10:12.845
not address this crisis alone

00:10:12.912 --> 00:10:15.648
we need to work in partnership

00:10:15.715 --> 00:10:16.248
with the state to allocate the

00:10:16.315 --> 00:10:23.923
funding recall. Tied on prices

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.523
and I'm also grateful to the

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:25.091
governor leadership on this

00:10:25.157 --> 00:10:28.594
issue. Twenty twenty. Twenty

00:10:28.661 --> 00:10:31.197
two. Twenty twenty one.

00:10:31.263 --> 00:10:31.797
Included unprecedented amount

00:10:31.864 --> 00:10:33.432
of state funding. As

00:10:33.499 --> 00:10:36.769
homelessness San Fran Cisco has

00:10:36.836 --> 00:10:39.505
received over twenty seven

00:10:39.572 --> 00:10:40.639
million dollars and he funding

00:10:40.706 --> 00:10:44.710
and we have invested those

00:10:44.777 --> 00:10:46.679
resources in rapid housing for

00:10:46.746 --> 00:10:49.048
transitional age you an adult

00:10:49.115 --> 00:10:49.648
and in the capital and operate

00:10:49.715 --> 00:10:51.650
a- and- versions. To help get

00:10:51.717 --> 00:10:55.988
people on the housing San

00:10:56.055 --> 00:10:59.592
Francisco will likely receive

00:10:59.658 --> 00:11:01.327
eight million dollars in a H.

00:11:01.394 --> 00:11:03.562
A. P. funding this year and we

00:11:03.629 --> 00:11:06.298
plan to use those resources to

00:11:06.365 --> 00:11:10.836
continue to expand our recent

00:11:10.903 --> 00:11:12.671
centers and it proved.

00:11:12.738 --> 00:11:14.607
Transcriptions access child.

00:11:14.673 --> 00:11:16.042
Third round of my money is

00:11:16.108 --> 00:11:17.009
appreciated would certainly go

00:11:17.076 --> 00:11:19.745
to get you over on going

00:11:19.812 --> 00:11:21.614
funding is not Terry to make a

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.184
meaningful impact in the lives

00:11:25.251 --> 00:11:25.785
of people on the streets in

00:11:25.851 --> 00:11:29.055
this ongoing funding will allow

00:11:29.121 --> 00:11:32.458
the cities and counties across

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:32.992
the state to continue the

00:11:33.059 --> 00:11:38.497
programs opened with- the both

00:11:38.564 --> 00:11:42.201
he and happy funding

00:11:42.268 --> 00:11:44.070
additionally. Funding will

00:11:44.136 --> 00:11:46.272
allow community vast in the

00:11:46.338 --> 00:11:47.640
most effective interview and

00:11:47.706 --> 00:11:51.510
that is. House without said

00:11:51.577 --> 00:11:56.115
later more rocker see an by

00:11:56.182 --> 00:11:56.849
passing cities and counties as

00:11:56.916 --> 00:11:59.552
outlined in the current

00:11:59.618 --> 00:12:01.487
proposal is counterproductive.

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:03.255
Cities and counties are

00:12:03.322 --> 00:12:03.923
primarily response the building

00:12:03.989 --> 00:12:06.325
employs operate. Respond state

00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:09.061
resort is to calm and local and

00:12:09.128 --> 00:12:13.899
federal funding I encourage the

00:12:13.966 --> 00:12:14.533
sub committee to re commit to

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.837
requiring that from the state

00:12:17.903 --> 00:12:18.304
be provided to local

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:22.174
jurisdictions. And this will in

00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:23.409
short in use. From programs

00:12:23.476 --> 00:12:24.310
that have been six. The good

00:12:24.376 --> 00:12:29.081
must are says to mandate is the

00:12:29.148 --> 00:12:31.584
most notable which is the legal

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.252
mandate to require local

00:12:33.319 --> 00:12:35.521
governments to commit resources

00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:37.456
to dramatically with

00:12:37.523 --> 00:12:39.892
homelessness in our communities

00:12:39.959 --> 00:12:41.393
and I support the goals of this

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:43.295
mandate and I see that every.

00:12:43.362 --> 00:12:46.298
Jurisdiction has to do their

00:12:46.365 --> 00:12:48.767
part across this this state to

00:12:48.834 --> 00:12:50.970
help address this issue I also

00:12:51.036 --> 00:12:51.537
saw the need for increased

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:54.540
accountability to ensure that

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:55.174
our limited resources are spent

00:12:55.241 --> 00:12:56.775
effectively however. I cannot

00:12:56.842 --> 00:12:59.578
support the constitution

00:12:59.645 --> 00:13:01.147
amendment as currently proposed

00:13:01.213 --> 00:13:04.250
because then you requirements

00:13:04.316 --> 00:13:05.918
placed on local government

00:13:05.985 --> 00:13:07.119
would not come with the needed

00:13:07.186 --> 00:13:09.655
resources to actually implement

00:13:09.722 --> 00:13:12.591
them- so. That's my two cents I

00:13:12.658 --> 00:13:14.493
wanna again thank you all so

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.162
much for working with my office

00:13:16.228 --> 00:13:18.164
during this budget process- to

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.099
help us address these issues- I

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:22.168
know that this is a very

00:13:22.234 --> 00:13:24.136
challenging issue and have a

00:13:24.203 --> 00:13:25.704
lot of great players with.

00:13:25.771 --> 00:13:28.107
Great ideas and a lot of people

00:13:28.174 --> 00:13:28.641
who are working hard. To

00:13:28.707 --> 00:13:30.342
address this issue and really

00:13:30.409 --> 00:13:32.545
proud of what we've done in San

00:13:32.611 --> 00:13:35.548
Francisco but of course we need

00:13:35.614 --> 00:13:37.650
more and we're hoping that

00:13:37.716 --> 00:13:39.818
you'll continue to work with us

00:13:39.885 --> 00:13:41.854
to accomplish the goals that we

00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:43.756
all want to see and that is

00:13:43.822 --> 00:13:48.561
putting. An end to homelessness

00:14:06.378 --> 00:14:07.846
huge part of the equation. I

00:14:07.913 --> 00:14:10.783

00:14:10.849 --> 00:14:12.718

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.842
point in our state we have. A

00:15:09.908 --> 00:15:13.078
homelessness crisis- with over

00:15:13.145 --> 00:15:14.813
a hundred and fifty one

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.483
thousand Californians who are

00:15:17.549 --> 00:15:21.153
on our street- we have about

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.054
nine thousand and- plus

00:15:22.121 --> 00:15:24.890
homeless individuals in San

00:15:24.957 --> 00:15:28.861
Francisco. LA que just finish

00:15:28.927 --> 00:15:34.233
the this not. John San

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:35.868
Francisco or Los Angeles or

00:15:35.934 --> 00:15:36.435
from I'm really appreciate I

00:15:36.502 --> 00:15:38.103
called again for being here

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:39.738
from Bakersfield this is an

00:15:39.805 --> 00:15:43.208
issue that. Into the Senate the

00:15:43.275 --> 00:15:46.645
only issue that really. Huge

00:15:46.712 --> 00:15:52.785
number of home. All up in the-

00:15:52.851 --> 00:15:53.452
all the leadership that we able

00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:54.953
to work with governor brown as

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.955
well governor knew some of the

00:15:57.022 --> 00:15:57.556
state over the last two years

00:15:57.623 --> 00:16:00.025
has specifically done. One

00:16:00.092 --> 00:16:03.462
point one billion dollars of

00:16:03.529 --> 00:16:05.631
funding to. Focus on

00:16:05.698 --> 00:16:09.902
homelessness that was. Counties

00:16:09.968 --> 00:16:10.536
que the continuum of care which

00:16:10.602 --> 00:16:12.404
is a variety of nonprofit

00:16:12.471 --> 00:16:14.340
networks it in counties who

00:16:14.406 --> 00:16:16.041
really have been fighting and

00:16:16.108 --> 00:16:17.409
what on this issue of

00:16:17.476 --> 00:16:20.145
homelessness for the last few

00:16:20.212 --> 00:16:22.614
decades we know that we need to

00:16:22.681 --> 00:16:25.050
do more- but just to put this

00:16:25.117 --> 00:16:28.020
in context is a huge jump from

00:16:28.087 --> 00:16:29.888
really where the state used to

00:16:29.955 --> 00:16:31.924
do. The state we have not. Hey

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:33.492
did in housing or hopelessness.

00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:38.063
It up till the last few. Really

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:43.035
the state have abdicated their

00:16:43.102 --> 00:16:45.771
ability the main the funding

00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:46.572
for housing was our low income

00:16:46.638 --> 00:16:48.273
housing tax credit. He had. All

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:53.045
all fired a few years ago. Even

00:16:53.112 --> 00:16:53.679
that funding to make sure that

00:16:53.746 --> 00:16:56.014
program was further further

00:16:56.081 --> 00:16:59.184
funded as well as to it for

00:16:59.251 --> 00:17:01.820
that we now are finding the

00:17:01.887 --> 00:17:05.257
area of homelessness. Yeah and-

00:17:05.324 --> 00:17:06.492
I've had the doctor of really

00:17:06.558 --> 00:17:07.960
working years ago really

00:17:08.026 --> 00:17:09.795
working with our- mers to bring

00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:12.631
this. To for we know that. Many

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:15.200
others are as my mayor talked

00:17:15.267 --> 00:17:17.636
about the all the mayors they

00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:20.439
feel like they're really at

00:17:20.506 --> 00:17:22.040
ground zero of this issue. Any

00:17:22.107 --> 00:17:24.376
exit don't those types of

00:17:24.443 --> 00:17:24.910
resort. Today as part our

00:17:24.977 --> 00:17:26.245
hearing we have represent from

00:17:26.311 --> 00:17:28.480
the ministry Papa the new

00:17:28.547 --> 00:17:30.582
proposal we also have

00:17:30.649 --> 00:17:33.385
representatives we have. Three

00:17:33.452 --> 00:17:35.921
three of the big city mayors

00:17:35.988 --> 00:17:39.124
well as represent us in LA

00:17:39.191 --> 00:17:46.031
county and also- really a-

00:17:46.098 --> 00:17:48.300
professor from UCSF more.

00:17:48.367 --> 00:17:48.934
Senator from whatever is on the

00:17:49.001 --> 00:17:50.569
cutting edge of homelessness

00:17:50.636 --> 00:17:56.775
but but today we wanted to make

00:17:56.842 --> 00:17:57.409
sure that this hearing was held

00:17:57.476 --> 00:18:01.680
in San Francisco in the bay

00:18:01.747 --> 00:18:02.314
area where we have really felt

00:18:02.381 --> 00:18:05.417
the crux of this issue for some

00:18:05.484 --> 00:18:07.553
years- now that it's really

00:18:07.619 --> 00:18:11.457
gotten to be done. Across the

00:18:11.523 --> 00:18:14.226
state. The state now decided to

00:18:14.293 --> 00:18:16.261
call partner in working to

00:18:16.328 --> 00:18:19.264
eradicate business in

00:18:19.331 --> 00:18:21.633
California. We we're proud to

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.303
have the world's fifth largest.

00:18:24.369 --> 00:18:27.005
The same time we want people

00:18:27.072 --> 00:18:29.107
living in poverty those that's

00:18:29.174 --> 00:18:33.078
one in five way too many at the

00:18:33.145 --> 00:18:34.246
same time that the economy is

00:18:34.313 --> 00:18:36.515
booming for some we have so

00:18:36.582 --> 00:18:39.485
many families indeed it. Can't

00:18:39.551 --> 00:18:41.920
the most be. The life they

00:18:41.987 --> 00:18:42.554
can't afford to buy food can't

00:18:42.621 --> 00:18:46.892
afford to pay rent they can't

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:48.327
afford to purchase gas for

00:18:48.393 --> 00:18:49.094
their vehicle to get to. And so

00:18:49.161 --> 00:18:54.099
we know. What are we doing make.

00:18:54.166 --> 00:18:57.836
Some of the middle class

00:18:57.903 --> 00:18:59.271
working class Californians and

00:18:59.338 --> 00:19:02.207
so again this is it this

00:19:02.274 --> 00:19:03.375
funding is a key piece of

00:19:03.442 --> 00:19:07.212
proposal really honor to have a

00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:08.814
number of my colleagues- join

00:19:08.881 --> 00:19:11.783
me today for our- open it to

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:18.290
them. If they have a- remarks.

00:19:18.357 --> 00:19:18.924
But for those that know me as a

00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:21.560
member Vince Fong represent the

00:19:21.627 --> 00:19:22.261
such about Kern county- but

00:19:22.327 --> 00:19:23.495
certainly I want to thank a

00:19:23.562 --> 00:19:29.868
charge for the in my- in a you

00:19:29.935 --> 00:19:30.469
know when we do we talk about

00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:34.439
housing and cal you know a lot

00:19:34.506 --> 00:19:35.073
of folks will think of the- in

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:35.707
the center valley in and rural

00:19:35.774 --> 00:19:37.276
communities yeah but we have a

00:19:37.342 --> 00:19:41.246
crisis as well and so for

00:19:41.313 --> 00:19:43.048
myself I only. Have delved

00:19:43.115 --> 00:19:44.750
into. Q. certainly will look

00:19:44.816 --> 00:19:45.284
for working with the guy.

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.686
Ministry well as a- I'm not.

00:19:47.753 --> 00:19:49.988
Right away the with the system

00:19:50.055 --> 00:19:53.625
as a whole certainly a lot of

00:19:53.692 --> 00:19:54.259
the attention goes to shelters

00:19:54.326 --> 00:19:56.161
and shelter heads- but you know

00:19:56.228 --> 00:19:58.897
we did a we utilizing

00:19:58.964 --> 00:20:00.999
collecting. The at them she's

00:20:01.066 --> 00:20:02.601
will get. You know using a to

00:20:02.668 --> 00:20:05.804
my sister. Most and we do

00:20:05.871 --> 00:20:06.405
assessment of individuals on

00:20:06.471 --> 00:20:08.640
the streets but no all we are

00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:10.809
we Atty using that- because

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:12.844
that that information is near

00:20:12.911 --> 00:20:14.846
real time as opposed to the

00:20:14.913 --> 00:20:15.380
point time can't which I

00:20:15.447 --> 00:20:19.952
participated in this year in I

00:20:20.018 --> 00:20:20.586
in my community. And certainly

00:20:20.652 --> 00:20:23.589
you know where the gaps- in are

00:20:23.655 --> 00:20:25.324
we investing in a doing enough

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:27.159
on that's what. I'm and are we

00:20:27.225 --> 00:20:27.759
investing enough in support

00:20:27.826 --> 00:20:29.728
housing so those are the areas

00:20:29.795 --> 00:20:32.064
that I certainly want to- desk

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:34.032
and learn from but certainly

00:20:34.099 --> 00:20:36.535
this is a this is that not

00:20:36.602 --> 00:20:39.071
only. Exists in urban centers

00:20:39.137 --> 00:20:39.671
by in the real centers as well

00:20:39.738 --> 00:20:45.077
so thank you very much. Strict

00:20:45.143 --> 00:20:45.644
fifty into a one of a begin

00:20:45.711 --> 00:20:47.312
thanking Kerr. A chair ting for

00:20:47.379 --> 00:20:48.747
always said taking opportunity

00:20:48.814 --> 00:20:51.016
to plug cut- the bear so. Go

00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:56.221
bears- our our- mutual- water.

00:20:56.288 --> 00:20:58.423
This is an extremely serious

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:00.993
issue it's one that's been

00:21:01.059 --> 00:21:02.928
going on- in California for far

00:21:02.995 --> 00:21:04.630
too long- I personally have

00:21:04.696 --> 00:21:06.598
been- a working on homeless

00:21:06.665 --> 00:21:08.500
issues for now over twenty

00:21:08.567 --> 00:21:12.771
years and- is the mayor of

00:21:12.838 --> 00:21:16.041
Santa Monica and- for a short

00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:16.608
period of time is executive

00:21:16.675 --> 00:21:17.943
director of a homeless

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:20.646
nonprofit- for so it's quite

00:21:20.712 --> 00:21:24.349
to. Sync up for all of us- to

00:21:24.416 --> 00:21:28.320
be here today after working on

00:21:28.387 --> 00:21:28.887
this issue for so long and

00:21:28.954 --> 00:21:30.589
seeing the numbers- a

00:21:30.656 --> 00:21:32.658
dramatically higher than they

00:21:32.724 --> 00:21:34.926
were of a few years ago but

00:21:34.993 --> 00:21:36.962
that number in southern

00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:37.529
California or even- in the

00:21:37.596 --> 00:21:40.699
state of a hundred and- fifty

00:21:40.766 --> 00:21:41.333
thousand plus. Most people who

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.136
are here- the fifty eight

00:21:44.202 --> 00:21:44.703
thousand are counted in Los

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:46.171
Angeles county and I was. Out

00:21:46.238 --> 00:21:48.240
on the streets Santa Monica- as

00:21:48.306 --> 00:21:48.840
part of the count- this year

00:21:48.907 --> 00:21:52.377
and every year since we started

00:21:52.444 --> 00:21:54.346
counting and number years ago-

00:21:54.413 --> 00:21:57.015
but that- number doesn't tell

00:21:57.082 --> 00:22:00.452
the whole story- in Los Angeles

00:22:00.519 --> 00:22:02.487
county- free is allowed to the-

00:22:02.554 --> 00:22:06.625
new. Yes P. died on the street

00:22:06.692 --> 00:22:10.262
each of the- years it's

00:22:10.328 --> 00:22:12.597
outrageous- it's outrageous

00:22:12.664 --> 00:22:18.203
particularly when we- recognize

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:18.770
that were actually housing.

00:22:18.837 --> 00:22:20.772
Where people than ever before

00:22:20.839 --> 00:22:23.208
you would think we'd be

00:22:23.275 --> 00:22:24.576
reducing those numbers and

00:22:24.643 --> 00:22:26.378
catching up but- we're doing

00:22:26.445 --> 00:22:28.714
good. And in regard not well

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:30.615
enough but we're doing better-

00:22:30.682 --> 00:22:32.651
but the problem that we face

00:22:32.718 --> 00:22:36.088
today. Is that more people are

00:22:36.154 --> 00:22:38.356
entering homelessness than are

00:22:38.423 --> 00:22:40.525
leaving in Los Angeles county-

00:22:40.592 --> 00:22:42.561
around a hundred and fifty

00:22:42.627 --> 00:22:44.663
three people a day. Are being

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:48.433
housed- but a significantly

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.902
higher number are entering

00:22:50.969 --> 00:22:52.838
homelessness on a daily basis

00:22:52.904 --> 00:22:54.773
and that's that delta that's

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.174
creating the- the statistic

00:22:56.241 --> 00:22:58.376
where we see a right. Number of

00:22:58.443 --> 00:23:00.278
people in three will but we

00:23:00.345 --> 00:23:00.846
need to do about it we also

00:23:00.912 --> 00:23:04.049
know- what the solutions are

00:23:04.116 --> 00:23:04.683
ultimately permanent supportive

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:07.085
housing- is the gold standard

00:23:07.152 --> 00:23:08.754
we need to build more we need

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.856
to provide that housing. But we

00:23:10.922 --> 00:23:12.357
also need to do more to prevent

00:23:12.424 --> 00:23:15.727
people from entering

00:23:15.794 --> 00:23:16.261
homelessness in the first

00:23:16.328 --> 00:23:21.099
place- as rental subsidies- and

00:23:21.166 --> 00:23:22.701
other. Energy out there we need

00:23:22.768 --> 00:23:26.271
to recognize that there are. A

00:23:26.338 --> 00:23:28.206
number of factors at play and

00:23:28.273 --> 00:23:32.144
why people are- ended up home

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:32.744
this this is not just one. One

00:23:32.811 --> 00:23:36.381
thing their social factors like

00:23:36.448 --> 00:23:38.483
of dental health issue that are

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:42.821
up the priest. Up close the

00:23:42.888 --> 00:23:48.360
biggest have. Dress the a we

00:23:48.426 --> 00:23:50.495
have a napa. Of math this. With

00:23:50.562 --> 00:23:52.464
no really good solutions that

00:23:52.531 --> 00:23:56.434
are taking a number of lives

00:23:56.501 --> 00:23:57.068
and destroying lives on a daily

00:23:57.135 --> 00:23:58.470
basis- throughout throughout

00:23:58.537 --> 00:24:02.374
the state so I'm really anxious

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.041
to hear from the administration

00:24:03.108 --> 00:24:06.444
understand better- the

00:24:06.511 --> 00:24:10.315
governor's proposal- I have for

00:24:10.382 --> 00:24:10.949
us some thoughts on that but

00:24:11.016 --> 00:24:12.117
all reserve the- for later.

00:24:12.184 --> 00:24:16.254
Thank you. Morning I'm David

00:24:16.321 --> 00:24:18.657

representing the district were

00:24:20.759 --> 00:24:21.927
in I want to welcome all of you

00:24:21.993 --> 00:24:22.427
to San Francisco to our

00:24:22.494 --> 00:24:24.095
colleagues- and to all of you

00:24:24.162 --> 00:24:27.265
in the audience that represent.

00:24:27.332 --> 00:24:29.901
Some of the- in community of

00:24:29.968 --> 00:24:32.737
leaders and advocates around

00:24:32.804 --> 00:24:35.574
the bay area around the state.

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:36.074
That are clean the moral

00:24:36.141 --> 00:24:39.978
question of today just. The

00:24:40.045 --> 00:24:40.445
what the state and the

00:24:40.512 --> 00:24:42.447
wealthiest country in the

00:24:42.514 --> 00:24:44.616
world. House the suffering that

00:24:44.683 --> 00:24:46.084
we are seen on our streets with

00:24:46.151 --> 00:24:46.585
over a hundred and fifty

00:24:46.651 --> 00:24:48.253
thousand. Californians re

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:51.590
night. Who do not have access

00:24:51.656 --> 00:24:55.060
to shelter- the double digit

00:24:55.126 --> 00:24:55.660
increases were seen in every

00:24:55.727 --> 00:24:57.362
major city in recent years- the

00:24:57.429 --> 00:24:59.030
fact of the matter is- this is.

00:24:59.097 --> 00:25:03.401
A crisis from. The northern.

00:25:03.468 --> 00:25:06.404
Hepatitis outbreaks in the

00:25:06.471 --> 00:25:06.972
homeless population in San

suburban county skip pro in Los

00:25:13.411 --> 00:25:14.246
Angeles in California you have

00:25:14.312 --> 00:25:14.813
farmworkers sleeping on the

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:19.084
field in our call. One out of

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:20.252
ten Ste. Who are effectively

00:25:20.318 --> 00:25:22.854
homeless sleeping in their cars

00:25:22.921 --> 00:25:26.825
on a friend's couch taking

00:25:26.892 --> 00:25:27.392
showers in the gym and of

00:25:27.459 --> 00:25:29.895
course the suffering that we

00:25:29.961 --> 00:25:32.964
are seen here in San Francisco

00:25:33.031 --> 00:25:34.299
and the bay area within a few

00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:34.900
blocks of where we are. As the

00:25:34.966 --> 00:25:37.402
of the too many also is a

00:25:37.469 --> 00:25:40.305
member. They want to. Our

00:25:40.372 --> 00:25:40.872
future thanks for convening

00:25:40.939 --> 00:25:42.974
this and let me best. I'm gonna

00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:44.676
ask the th question that are on

00:25:44.743 --> 00:25:47.178
that's on my mind right now and

00:25:47.245 --> 00:25:47.812
if the extent to which various

00:25:47.879 --> 00:25:50.916
panels might be able to answer

00:25:50.982 --> 00:25:51.416
parts of them- I would

00:25:51.483 --> 00:25:52.817
appreciate that for me is the

00:25:52.884 --> 00:25:56.821
chair of the housing committee-

00:25:56.888 --> 00:25:57.389
really three things we are

00:25:57.455 --> 00:25:58.957
focused on. First what are the

00:25:59.024 --> 00:26:00.558
specific and crew right

00:26:00.625 --> 00:26:02.661
solutions for addressing the

00:26:02.727 --> 00:26:03.261
challenges your seats streets

00:26:03.328 --> 00:26:05.664
we know there's a diversity

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:08.500
reasons why. Individuals become

00:26:08.566 --> 00:26:09.034
homeless and what are the

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:12.537
eight- hue. And sufficient and

00:26:12.604 --> 00:26:14.906
effective ways for us to

00:26:14.973 --> 00:26:16.508
address the suffering was seen

00:26:16.574 --> 00:26:22.714
our streets. Sec this had we.

00:26:22.781 --> 00:26:23.181
The very first bill I

00:26:23.248 --> 00:26:24.382
introduced this year. A

00:26:24.449 --> 00:26:26.584
proposed first time that. Right

00:26:26.651 --> 00:26:28.520
than it in. Recent time for

00:26:28.586 --> 00:26:30.422
homeless the we establish a

00:26:30.488 --> 00:26:32.290
source of for homelessness we

00:26:32.357 --> 00:26:34.092
are not going to be able to get

00:26:34.159 --> 00:26:35.894
out of this crisis in

00:26:35.961 --> 00:26:39.864
202-020-2120 two we need a plan

00:26:39.931 --> 00:26:40.465
for the short term the medium

00:26:40.532 --> 00:26:41.967
term. And long term. My third

00:26:42.033 --> 00:26:46.304
question- for all of you is

00:26:46.371 --> 00:26:46.938
assuming we know what the right

00:26:47.005 --> 00:26:49.007
answers are assuming. We are

00:26:49.074 --> 00:26:51.910
able to find the solutions at

00:26:51.977 --> 00:26:52.544
the level that they need to be

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:55.246
funded at. How do we ensure

00:26:55.313 --> 00:26:56.414
that we are holding our schools

00:26:56.481 --> 00:26:57.649
accountable to achieving these

00:26:57.716 --> 00:27:00.485
results were the metrics we use

00:27:00.552 --> 00:27:02.220
what are the mechanisms. Used

00:27:02.287 --> 00:27:02.787
to ensure everyone involved

00:27:02.854 --> 00:27:04.456
from the eight to count and

00:27:04.522 --> 00:27:05.924
cities all of the- various

00:27:05.991 --> 00:27:08.460
stakeholders. Nonprofit in

00:27:08.526 --> 00:27:09.060
advocacy organizations working

00:27:09.127 --> 00:27:10.395
on. How do we all hold cells

00:27:10.462 --> 00:27:14.199
accountable for ensuring that

00:27:14.265 --> 00:27:16.134
we and this is because of what

00:27:16.201 --> 00:27:16.801
the vision of this conversation

00:27:16.868 --> 00:27:18.236
needs to be. Is a day in

00:27:18.303 --> 00:27:20.705
California does not have a

00:27:20.772 --> 00:27:22.607
hundred fifty thousand people

00:27:22.674 --> 00:27:23.174
every night sleeping on the

00:27:23.241 --> 00:27:24.409
streets a day when.

00:27:24.476 --> 00:27:25.944
Homelessness no longer exists

00:27:26.011 --> 00:27:28.179
and I know we all. Hope that we

00:27:28.246 --> 00:27:30.181
can achieve that and that is

00:27:30.248 --> 00:27:32.083
why we hear so with that again

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:34.386
appreciate the conversation and

00:27:34.452 --> 00:27:34.919
look forward to it. Mister

00:27:34.986 --> 00:27:36.321
chair. Thank you very much. We

00:27:36.388 --> 00:27:40.525
will start with. Away as well

00:27:40.592 --> 00:27:41.993
as departmental service we

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.029
have. Lower does moralis from

00:27:44.095 --> 00:27:46.297
only if you could please come

00:27:46.364 --> 00:27:48.166
up as well as Chen Troyer from.

00:27:48.233 --> 00:27:58.343
Department of social services.

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:00.412
And we can start with L. thank

00:28:00.478 --> 00:28:06.017
you. Good morning. I'm Lucas

00:28:06.084 --> 00:28:06.618
moralis with the legislative

00:28:06.684 --> 00:28:08.420
analyst's office I've been

00:28:08.486 --> 00:28:08.987
asked by the committee to

00:28:09.054 --> 00:28:10.355
provide background on the

00:28:10.422 --> 00:28:12.157
state's homelessness-

00:28:12.223 --> 00:28:14.192
challenges and provide an

00:28:14.259 --> 00:28:16.361
update on major recent state

00:28:16.428 --> 00:28:21.633
actions. Seven asked to provide

00:28:21.699 --> 00:28:28.473
an update. On. On the state of

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:30.742
homes in California and how the

00:28:30.809 --> 00:28:32.444
state has responded in recent

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:34.846
years so I will from this hand

00:28:34.913 --> 00:28:38.149
before you know believe there's

00:28:38.216 --> 00:28:38.750
extra copies for the audience

00:28:38.817 --> 00:28:40.385
as well. If you'll turn to the

00:28:40.452 --> 00:28:42.821
first page. This really is a

00:28:42.887 --> 00:28:44.522
lot of the comments that may

00:28:44.589 --> 00:28:48.827
aid in other opening remarks.

00:28:48.893 --> 00:28:49.427
While homelessness is a very

00:28:49.494 --> 00:28:50.295
complex problem that has many

00:28:50.361 --> 00:28:53.198
causes we see that the high

00:28:53.264 --> 00:28:54.332
cost of housing in the state is

00:28:54.399 --> 00:28:56.000
a significant contributor if

00:28:56.067 --> 00:28:58.203
you look at figure one on the

00:28:58.269 --> 00:28:58.736
first page you see that

00:28:58.803 --> 00:29:00.572
Californians spend more. Of

00:29:00.638 --> 00:29:02.273
their income on housing at

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:04.275
every income quartile and this

00:29:04.342 --> 00:29:06.377
is a more income across. As a

00:29:06.444 --> 00:29:10.148
comparison to how folks spend

00:29:10.215 --> 00:29:12.150
their income across the state

00:29:12.217 --> 00:29:12.684
and to the rising cost of

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.552
housing. Has exceeded the

00:29:14.619 --> 00:29:16.454
increase in wages particularly

00:29:16.521 --> 00:29:18.623
for a low income households

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:22.227
that's a lot of stress-

00:29:22.293 --> 00:29:24.462
particularly for the one point

00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:26.264
five. More than half of their

00:29:26.331 --> 00:29:28.199
income towards rent and so for

00:29:28.266 --> 00:29:30.135
these populations. A job loss

00:29:30.201 --> 00:29:32.670
or an unexpected expense could

00:29:32.737 --> 00:29:36.141
result in homelessness. The

00:29:36.207 --> 00:29:38.109
turning to the second page. We

00:29:38.176 --> 00:29:40.578
see that a mid at these high

00:29:40.645 --> 00:29:42.413
cost high cost of housing that

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.115
we see in the state of

00:29:44.182 --> 00:29:46.317
California has over one hundred

00:29:46.384 --> 00:29:48.486
and fifty one thousand people

00:29:48.553 --> 00:29:50.155
experiencing homelessness. This

00:29:50.221 --> 00:29:52.357
is more people than any other

00:29:52.423 --> 00:29:53.958
state of the nation the figure

00:29:54.025 --> 00:29:56.661
on page two lays out some of

00:29:56.728 --> 00:29:58.163
the characteristics of the

00:29:58.229 --> 00:30:00.098
state's unless population. At

00:30:00.165 --> 00:30:00.698
some of the when the highlight

00:30:00.765 --> 00:30:03.134
who are that the state's almost

00:30:03.201 --> 00:30:04.402
by increased by about 16%

00:30:04.469 --> 00:30:06.704
between two thousand eighteen

00:30:06.771 --> 00:30:11.509
and thousand nineteen. 72% of

00:30:11.576 --> 00:30:14.045
the state's homeless population

00:30:14.112 --> 00:30:17.215
is on sheltered overall 27% of

00:30:17.282 --> 00:30:19.417
the homeless population is

00:30:19.484 --> 00:30:20.752
chronically on sheltered. This

00:30:20.818 --> 00:30:22.320
information is based on the

00:30:22.387 --> 00:30:24.556
twenty nineteen point in time

00:30:24.622 --> 00:30:26.324
found. Out while the twenty

00:30:26.391 --> 00:30:26.958
twenty point in time count has

00:30:27.025 --> 00:30:28.526
taken place those results are

00:30:28.593 --> 00:30:30.695
not just yet of it well from

00:30:30.762 --> 00:30:32.163
the federal government. If

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:34.399
you'll turn to the third page

00:30:34.465 --> 00:30:36.201
of the handout you'll see a

00:30:36.267 --> 00:30:36.768
image that depicts how the

00:30:36.834 --> 00:30:38.536
homeless population is spread

00:30:38.603 --> 00:30:40.271
across the state. As was

00:30:40.338 --> 00:30:42.307
mentioned already there's a

00:30:42.373 --> 00:30:42.807
great concentration of

00:30:42.874 --> 00:30:44.742
hopelessness in the greater LA

00:30:44.809 --> 00:30:46.444
region. Overall we see that

00:30:46.511 --> 00:30:48.513
about two thirds of the state's

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.648
homeless population are spread

00:30:50.715 --> 00:30:52.483
with in the seven it continues

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:54.352
of care that are identified in

00:30:54.419 --> 00:30:56.187
the map. The remainder so the

00:30:56.254 --> 00:30:56.754
one third of the homeless

00:30:56.821 --> 00:30:58.356
population reside among the

00:30:58.423 --> 00:31:02.560
other thirty seven CEO sees.

00:31:02.627 --> 00:31:03.161
It's also likely that these

00:31:03.228 --> 00:31:04.195
numbers aren't under account-

00:31:04.262 --> 00:31:06.664
we know that efforts to produce

00:31:06.731 --> 00:31:07.232
an accurate in concur and

00:31:07.298 --> 00:31:08.866
complete count are hindered by

00:31:08.933 --> 00:31:10.235
a number of factors. Including

00:31:10.301 --> 00:31:12.503
the transitory nature of the

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:14.572
homeless population that makes

00:31:14.639 --> 00:31:15.173
them inherently difficult to

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.808
count. As well as other

00:31:16.874 --> 00:31:18.710
limitations as was mentioned.

00:31:18.776 --> 00:31:20.345
Individuals that are couch

00:31:20.411 --> 00:31:23.281
surfing or families that live

00:31:23.348 --> 00:31:23.915
in overcrowded housing are just

00:31:23.982 --> 00:31:25.149
not to mention that our is

00:31:25.216 --> 00:31:27.518
difficult are are easy to be

00:31:27.585 --> 00:31:28.086
sure in the point in time

00:31:28.152 --> 00:31:29.954
county. Represent an important

00:31:30.021 --> 00:31:33.091
dimension of the state's home

00:31:33.157 --> 00:31:34.759
with. This crisis. So have you

00:31:34.826 --> 00:31:37.228
provided the con. For the

00:31:37.295 --> 00:31:39.664
breath of homelessness in

00:31:39.731 --> 00:31:40.298
California I'll transition to

00:31:40.365 --> 00:31:42.367
discussing efforts to address

00:31:42.433 --> 00:31:46.838
homelessness turn to page four.

00:31:46.904 --> 00:31:48.473
Starting out as a higher more

00:31:48.539 --> 00:31:50.074
conceptual level we see that

00:31:50.141 --> 00:31:51.376
there's sort of two main

00:31:51.442 --> 00:31:53.144
buckets. The first approach are

00:31:53.211 --> 00:31:56.281
mechanisms that lasts but may

00:31:56.347 --> 00:31:58.583
offer only temporary solutions

00:31:58.650 --> 00:31:59.150
the for example things like

00:31:59.217 --> 00:32:00.551
shelter that are generally

00:32:00.618 --> 00:32:05.256
ease- more cost effective have

00:32:05.323 --> 00:32:05.923
lower barriers of entry and get

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.457
them up and running more

00:32:06.524 --> 00:32:08.293
quickly. The downside to this

00:32:08.359 --> 00:32:09.627
is that you're not the read is

00:32:09.694 --> 00:32:11.296
that and folks lean back into

00:32:11.362 --> 00:32:12.263
homelessness. Then we also see

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:14.799
other strategies that while

00:32:14.866 --> 00:32:16.734
they cost more it may have more

00:32:16.801 --> 00:32:17.335
long term benefits for example

00:32:17.402 --> 00:32:18.603
permanent supportive housing

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:20.938
which was discussed in the

00:32:21.005 --> 00:32:22.674
opening comment. To be out more

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.442
permanent of the red. You see.

00:32:24.509 --> 00:32:26.778
Need more cost and a longer

00:32:26.844 --> 00:32:28.446
time to get these types of

00:32:28.513 --> 00:32:32.583
services up and running.

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:34.552
Turning to the fifth page of

00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:36.487
the handout. Sir to get into

00:32:36.554 --> 00:32:38.456
more specifics about what the

00:32:38.523 --> 00:32:40.792
state has historically done to

00:32:40.858 --> 00:32:43.494
address homelessness. So we see

00:32:43.561 --> 00:32:45.196
that California in partnership

00:32:45.263 --> 00:32:46.264
with the federal government has

00:32:46.331 --> 00:32:48.433
a struggle administered a

00:32:48.499 --> 00:32:49.067
number of programs that help

00:32:49.133 --> 00:32:50.401
address- the needs of

00:32:50.468 --> 00:32:52.503
individuals experiencing

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:54.739
homelessness here we see sort

00:32:54.806 --> 00:32:55.306
of the very first type of

00:32:55.373 --> 00:32:56.674
programs are those that help

00:32:56.741 --> 00:32:58.576
building new. Affordably priced

00:32:58.643 --> 00:33:00.712
housing primarily been through

00:33:00.778 --> 00:33:02.547
things like tax credits that

00:33:02.613 --> 00:33:03.047
provide tax breaks to

00:33:03.114 --> 00:33:06.451
developers without another

00:33:06.517 --> 00:33:07.085
exchange for that you see them

00:33:07.151 --> 00:33:08.619
reserving units for lower

00:33:08.686 --> 00:33:10.755
individuals. You also see types

00:33:10.822 --> 00:33:12.590
of programs that help

00:33:12.657 --> 00:33:14.325
individuals of for housing

00:33:14.392 --> 00:33:14.992
these are things like vouchers

00:33:15.059 --> 00:33:19.697
that provide payments directly

00:33:19.764 --> 00:33:20.264
to landlords and make units

00:33:20.331 --> 00:33:22.367
more affordable for.

00:33:22.433 --> 00:33:24.736
Individuals and the last

00:33:24.802 --> 00:33:27.238
grounds are health and Human

00:33:27.305 --> 00:33:28.773
Services. Well these programs

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.675
may not a- provide health

00:33:30.742 --> 00:33:31.209
benefits the provide other

00:33:31.275 --> 00:33:33.177
types of. That build help

00:33:33.244 --> 00:33:35.380
develop self sufficiency in

00:33:35.446 --> 00:33:35.947
that way might help people

00:33:36.013 --> 00:33:37.949
prevent or come out of

00:33:38.015 --> 00:33:40.651
homelessness. In the middle of

00:33:40.718 --> 00:33:41.285
page fire that there's a number

00:33:41.352 --> 00:33:42.353
of state department that had

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:42.954
been involved in administering

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:44.655
these types of service some of

00:33:44.722 --> 00:33:48.893
the key ones are- are each deal

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:49.460
at the state and the council

00:33:49.527 --> 00:33:50.762
that was established in recent

00:33:50.828 --> 00:33:52.663
years. But then you'll see a

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:54.699
number of other departments GFS

00:33:54.766 --> 00:33:57.435
as well as cal that have their

00:33:57.502 --> 00:33:57.935
their own homelessness

00:33:58.002 --> 00:34:00.338
programs. Funding for these

00:34:00.405 --> 00:34:00.838
programs come from for a

00:34:00.905 --> 00:34:03.040
variety of different mechanisms

00:34:03.107 --> 00:34:03.608
and we said we've seen that

00:34:03.674 --> 00:34:04.542
over the years the amount of

00:34:04.609 --> 00:34:06.511
funding available for these

00:34:06.577 --> 00:34:07.145
programs as varied we've seen.

00:34:07.211 --> 00:34:08.813
Even more recently that there's

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.381
been significant one time

00:34:10.448 --> 00:34:16.754
augmentations. What about the-

00:34:16.821 --> 00:34:17.355
of way in which the state has

00:34:17.422 --> 00:34:18.389
historically been involved if

00:34:18.456 --> 00:34:20.558
you'll turn to state. To page

00:34:20.625 --> 00:34:22.860
six we talk about the local

00:34:22.927 --> 00:34:24.695
level response we've seen that

00:34:24.762 --> 00:34:25.296
while the state has provided

00:34:25.363 --> 00:34:26.631
funding it's really at the

00:34:26.697 --> 00:34:28.633
local level where- services are

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:32.303
provided. Relying in part on

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:35.139
the state and federal sources.

00:34:35.206 --> 00:34:35.773
And local governments are most

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.542
knowledgeable about the

00:34:37.608 --> 00:34:39.744
specific needs of the homeless

00:34:39.811 --> 00:34:40.211
populations in their

00:34:40.278 --> 00:34:40.711
communities. And making

00:34:40.778 --> 00:34:41.979
decisions about what is the

00:34:42.046 --> 00:34:45.583
right mix of approaches make

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:47.151
sense for them. As in

00:34:47.218 --> 00:34:48.820
recognition of this we've seen

00:34:48.886 --> 00:34:49.387
quite a bit of flexibility

00:34:49.454 --> 00:34:51.255
given to local governments and

00:34:51.322 --> 00:34:53.724
exercising how these programs

00:34:53.791 --> 00:34:55.693
are used- we highlighted the

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.327
middle the page a few examples.

00:34:56.394 --> 00:34:57.261
Of funding sources that either

00:34:57.328 --> 00:34:59.797
a state- sources that provide a

00:34:59.864 --> 00:35:03.768
lot of flexibility or measures

00:35:03.835 --> 00:35:04.735
that local governments have

00:35:04.802 --> 00:35:05.303
taken upon themselves to

00:35:05.369 --> 00:35:07.905
identify new sources. To

00:35:07.972 --> 00:35:08.506
dedicate towards homelessness

00:35:08.573 --> 00:35:10.041
response and we- government.

00:35:10.107 --> 00:35:12.009
The state thing I. Was in a

00:35:12.076 --> 00:35:15.079
housing or rent stabilization

00:35:15.146 --> 00:35:16.314
efforts that can bring relief

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:17.915
to the space. So in summary

00:35:17.982 --> 00:35:19.584
here that the key is. The local

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:21.085
response has really been driven

00:35:21.152 --> 00:35:22.620
by locals own decisions about

00:35:22.687 --> 00:35:23.221
the challenges they are facing

00:35:23.287 --> 00:35:25.256
and what makes sense to help.

00:35:25.323 --> 00:35:26.757
Us homelessness in their own

00:35:26.824 --> 00:35:30.695
communities. So what I just

00:35:30.761 --> 00:35:32.597
presented has been sort of the

00:35:32.663 --> 00:35:34.499
historical nature of the state

00:35:34.565 --> 00:35:35.066
and local response. But if

00:35:35.132 --> 00:35:36.868
you'll turn to page seven we'll

00:35:36.934 --> 00:35:38.636
see that in recent years that

00:35:38.703 --> 00:35:40.638
dynamic has become has evolved

00:35:40.705 --> 00:35:43.007
and we've seen the state take a

00:35:43.074 --> 00:35:44.642
more active role in helping

00:35:44.709 --> 00:35:46.711
locals. Support the homeless

00:35:46.777 --> 00:35:47.211
needs within their own

00:35:47.278 --> 00:35:50.548
communities the chart on page

00:35:50.615 --> 00:35:51.115
seven highlights some of the

00:35:51.182 --> 00:35:53.017
major state actions in recent

00:35:53.084 --> 00:35:55.019
years. The state has generally

00:35:55.086 --> 00:35:56.954
taken a year by year approach

00:35:57.021 --> 00:35:59.190
in considering and authorizing

00:35:59.257 --> 00:36:01.058
new funding sources. Towards

00:36:01.125 --> 00:36:02.827
helping address hopelessness.

00:36:02.894 --> 00:36:05.062
All these major actions have

00:36:05.129 --> 00:36:06.964
authorized over three billion

00:36:07.031 --> 00:36:08.833
dollars towards homelessness.

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:10.735
And whether these funds have

00:36:10.801 --> 00:36:12.870
been of authorized by the

00:36:12.937 --> 00:36:13.504
voters in the place of no place

00:36:13.571 --> 00:36:14.906
like. Are on. The legislature

00:36:14.972 --> 00:36:16.841
and the governor through the

00:36:16.908 --> 00:36:18.643
project budget process. To that

00:36:18.709 --> 00:36:19.210
each of these programs has

00:36:19.277 --> 00:36:20.511
their own set of parameters

00:36:20.578 --> 00:36:23.748
that identify the eligible uses

00:36:23.814 --> 00:36:26.150
of the funding. Identify

00:36:26.217 --> 00:36:26.751
requirements set methodologies

00:36:26.817 --> 00:36:30.988
for allocation and establish

00:36:31.055 --> 00:36:31.756
their own oversight mechanisms.

00:36:31.822 --> 00:36:34.759
So all of. Them are relatively

00:36:34.825 --> 00:36:37.228
new. The first until the end to

00:36:37.295 --> 00:36:38.696
which we can to about. What has

00:36:38.763 --> 00:36:39.263
been achieved it has some

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:40.765
limitations but over the next

00:36:40.831 --> 00:36:43.034
few pages I'll talk about each

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:45.236
of these three interns are the

00:36:45.303 --> 00:36:45.770
highlight some of the key

00:36:45.836 --> 00:36:46.904
features what we know today

00:36:46.971 --> 00:36:48.706
about how the programs are

00:36:48.773 --> 00:36:51.075
working. On page eight we turn

00:36:51.142 --> 00:36:52.710
to no place like home. Which

00:36:52.777 --> 00:36:54.745
was established by the

00:36:54.812 --> 00:36:55.413
legislature but then authorized

00:36:55.479 --> 00:36:57.715
by voters this part of

00:36:57.782 --> 00:37:00.451
proposition two and a twenty

00:37:00.518 --> 00:37:02.887
eighteen. This program is

00:37:02.954 --> 00:37:06.257
specifically targeted towards

00:37:06.324 --> 00:37:08.192
new construction you have been

00:37:08.259 --> 00:37:08.960
or rehabilitation of existing

00:37:09.026 --> 00:37:10.361
housing. Individuals

00:37:10.428 --> 00:37:12.830
experiencing the ana so he see

00:37:12.897 --> 00:37:16.067
interest and target specific

00:37:16.133 --> 00:37:16.701
type of homeless population. A

00:37:16.767 --> 00:37:18.669
lot of this in has already come

00:37:18.736 --> 00:37:21.806
out there's more money that

00:37:21.872 --> 00:37:22.406
it's expected to be dispersed

00:37:22.473 --> 00:37:23.541
over. The next two years- but

00:37:23.608 --> 00:37:25.176
we have heard of that at least

00:37:25.242 --> 00:37:25.810
the funding that was available

00:37:25.876 --> 00:37:28.079
or made available through the

00:37:28.145 --> 00:37:30.414
twenty nineteen twenty budget

00:37:30.481 --> 00:37:30.948
years estimated to build

00:37:31.015 --> 00:37:33.017
between thirteen hundred and

00:37:33.084 --> 00:37:34.952
eight hundred additional units

00:37:35.019 --> 00:37:35.486
on the seas are permanent

00:37:35.553 --> 00:37:39.090
supportive housing units. On

00:37:39.156 --> 00:37:41.792
page nine we turn to the

00:37:41.859 --> 00:37:42.393
homeless emergency aid program

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:46.397
heap. This was a new program

00:37:46.464 --> 00:37:51.769
that was established is part of.

00:37:51.836 --> 00:37:52.403
Twenty eighteen twenty nineteen

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:54.372
budget cycle it's administered

00:37:54.438 --> 00:37:54.872
under the homelessness

00:37:54.939 --> 00:37:57.441
coordinating and finance

00:37:57.508 --> 00:37:59.744
council allocated on a one time

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:00.311
basis five hundred million

00:38:00.378 --> 00:38:04.115
dollars in grants to local

00:38:04.181 --> 00:38:05.983
governments of these are cities

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:07.952
and continuum of care you

00:38:08.019 --> 00:38:08.452
provide a quite a bit of

00:38:08.519 --> 00:38:09.120
flexibility on how these. Funds

00:38:09.186 --> 00:38:11.756
were you. Sort of the bottom of

00:38:11.822 --> 00:38:14.892
page. Some of the ways in which

00:38:14.959 --> 00:38:15.459
local governments using the

00:38:15.526 --> 00:38:17.161
funding. By services to make

00:38:17.228 --> 00:38:20.731
capital improvements make a

00:38:20.798 --> 00:38:21.332
provide assistance and as well

00:38:21.399 --> 00:38:23.434
as help homeless you. What we

00:38:23.501 --> 00:38:23.968
see in this program that

00:38:24.035 --> 00:38:25.503
homeless youth was one of the

00:38:25.569 --> 00:38:26.103
particular out populations of

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:27.071
interest and there is a

00:38:27.138 --> 00:38:29.340
requirement that to use these

00:38:29.407 --> 00:38:31.876
funds local jurisdictions

00:38:31.942 --> 00:38:34.712
designate- emergency shelter

00:38:34.779 --> 00:38:36.681
crisis. So then these are ways

00:38:36.747 --> 00:38:37.314
in which the programs have been

00:38:37.381 --> 00:38:39.817
shaped to provide and support

00:38:39.884 --> 00:38:42.286
very specific. Purposes there

00:38:42.353 --> 00:38:45.856
is. To page eleven we have the

00:38:45.923 --> 00:38:46.490
homelessness housing assistance

00:38:46.557 --> 00:38:48.959
and prevention program. This

00:38:49.026 --> 00:38:51.295
was just authorizes part of the

00:38:51.362 --> 00:38:51.862
nineteen twenty budget cycle

00:38:51.929 --> 00:38:53.664
and here again we see sort of

00:38:53.731 --> 00:38:55.933
funding from the state going on

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.736
a one time basis this time six

00:38:58.803 --> 00:38:59.270
hundred and fifty million

00:38:59.336 --> 00:38:59.737
dollars towards local

00:38:59.804 --> 00:39:04.542
government whereas he paid

00:39:04.608 --> 00:39:06.177
funding to cities and going to

00:39:06.243 --> 00:39:12.483
care you see this program.

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:15.786
Communities working cult to

00:39:15.853 --> 00:39:17.254
address this is within their

00:39:17.321 --> 00:39:17.855
communities as a condition of

00:39:17.922 --> 00:39:18.789
getting some of these funds.

00:39:18.856 --> 00:39:21.859
Seen third less progress a lot

00:39:21.926 --> 00:39:25.996
of in his yet to be released-

00:39:26.063 --> 00:39:26.597
for all these programs we see

00:39:26.664 --> 00:39:28.132
that there's reporting higher

00:39:28.199 --> 00:39:29.700
men's that require recipients

00:39:29.767 --> 00:39:31.001
provide updates on how it's

00:39:31.068 --> 00:39:33.270
going for the heat program the

00:39:33.337 --> 00:39:33.938
first annual report was just do

00:39:34.004 --> 00:39:35.439
in January and we understand

00:39:35.506 --> 00:39:36.874
the administration. Are

00:39:36.941 --> 00:39:37.408
reviewing those reports a

00:39:37.475 --> 00:39:38.909
better sense of. A how can how

00:39:38.976 --> 00:39:40.911
local governments are using the

00:39:40.978 --> 00:39:45.850
funds and to what effect. On

00:39:45.916 --> 00:39:47.752
page twelve of the out we just

00:39:47.818 --> 00:39:50.454
mentioned that. There's been an

00:39:50.521 --> 00:39:52.256
expansion of the state's

00:39:52.323 --> 00:39:52.790
involvement in the state

00:39:52.857 --> 00:39:54.225
portion of the low income

00:39:54.291 --> 00:39:59.330
housing tax credit five hundred

00:39:59.396 --> 00:39:59.964
million dollars authorized as

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:00.564
part of the nineteen twelve.

00:40:00.631 --> 00:40:01.999
It's to the final note make

00:40:02.066 --> 00:40:05.069
here that. This edition of the

00:40:05.136 --> 00:40:07.138
recent action. To help support

00:40:07.204 --> 00:40:07.805
locals it's really been up to

00:40:07.872 --> 00:40:12.309
the local level where a lot of

00:40:12.376 --> 00:40:12.910
the services are provided and

00:40:12.977 --> 00:40:13.410
there's been a lot of

00:40:13.477 --> 00:40:14.378
discretion in these local

00:40:14.445 --> 00:40:17.248
governments providing sources

00:40:17.314 --> 00:40:17.848
in a way that makes sense for

00:40:17.915 --> 00:40:19.917
them. And so soared up on the

00:40:19.984 --> 00:40:21.418
Avenue on the final page of the

00:40:21.485 --> 00:40:24.722
handout on page thirteen we

00:40:24.789 --> 00:40:26.157
just highlight some key local

00:40:26.223 --> 00:40:29.026
government efforts. To provide

00:40:29.093 --> 00:40:29.660
services in their jurisdiction

00:40:29.727 --> 00:40:30.928
we see a- making their own

00:40:30.995 --> 00:40:33.130
policy discussions we highlight

00:40:33.197 --> 00:40:35.766
here Los Angeles county the

00:40:35.833 --> 00:40:37.334
stop the final of a flexible

00:40:37.401 --> 00:40:38.302
funding pull. That brings

00:40:38.369 --> 00:40:38.936
together funding from a variety

00:40:39.003 --> 00:40:40.638
of sources to provide rental

00:40:40.704 --> 00:40:42.039
assistance and other services

00:40:42.106 --> 00:40:42.640
to those individuals that are

00:40:42.706 --> 00:40:44.241
experiencing homelessness in

00:40:44.308 --> 00:40:45.976
their community. And we see

00:40:46.043 --> 00:40:47.878
jurisdictions popping. Their

00:40:47.945 --> 00:40:51.081
own ballot measures to

00:40:51.148 --> 00:40:51.682
authorize additional funding

00:40:51.749 --> 00:40:54.785
toward this is a we see not en

00:40:54.852 --> 00:40:56.921
Los Angeles city and county as

00:40:56.987 --> 00:40:58.389
well as Senate. In Alameda

00:40:58.455 --> 00:41:00.591
county. To give you a flavor of

00:41:00.658 --> 00:41:02.259
not for this. The state but the

00:41:02.326 --> 00:41:03.828
also the way in which state and

00:41:03.894 --> 00:41:06.130
local interacted I'm happy to

00:41:06.197 --> 00:41:07.031
take any questions that you.

00:41:07.097 --> 00:41:10.701
Great before we take questions

00:41:10.768 --> 00:41:11.235
just wanna highlighted for

00:41:11.302 --> 00:41:12.036
people who are interested in

00:41:12.102 --> 00:41:13.504
actually obtaining the-

00:41:13.571 --> 00:41:16.740
legislative analyst's report

00:41:16.807 --> 00:41:19.043
you can find on their website

00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:20.744
eight. Google legislative

00:41:20.811 --> 00:41:22.279
analyst's office for a few

00:41:22.346 --> 00:41:22.847
Google the- we are committed

00:41:22.913 --> 00:41:24.648
all on our website. But with

00:41:24.715 --> 00:41:27.184
that the committee any

00:41:27.251 --> 00:41:29.486
questions for illegal. This is

00:41:29.553 --> 00:41:34.992
for. I'm just a few quick

00:41:35.059 --> 00:41:35.993
questions- in terms of the

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:42.299
undercount at the accuracy of

00:41:42.366 --> 00:41:42.933
the numbers Sir Alan's for us

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:43.801
especially. Since we're

00:41:43.868 --> 00:41:44.401
providing oversight it and how

00:41:44.468 --> 00:41:47.638
do we properly yes the effect.

00:41:47.705 --> 00:41:50.474
Are you can example are part

00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:51.075
time count twenty nineteen was

00:41:51.141 --> 00:41:56.146
hundred individuals who are

00:41:56.213 --> 00:41:56.714
homeless though- are a to my

00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:58.849
system we that we currently

00:41:58.916 --> 00:42:01.352
have where individuals who are

00:42:01.418 --> 00:42:03.087
says on the street. But through.

00:42:03.153 --> 00:42:03.621
The programs and- provide

00:42:03.687 --> 00:42:06.056
services we probably have three

00:42:06.123 --> 00:42:06.857
thousand individuals in our

00:42:06.924 --> 00:42:09.460
database- so that's- and so

00:42:09.526 --> 00:42:11.762
when we do these point counts

00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:13.664
and the numbers continue to

00:42:13.731 --> 00:42:17.935
increase because of Harper more

00:42:18.002 --> 00:42:18.469
volunteers. Whatever the

00:42:18.535 --> 00:42:23.040
reasons are. It may be that

00:42:23.107 --> 00:42:23.574
there isn't more homeless

00:42:23.641 --> 00:42:24.675
stages we didn't count them at

00:42:24.742 --> 00:42:27.411
the first time or order were

00:42:27.478 --> 00:42:28.045
under counting as you in a bit.

00:42:28.112 --> 00:42:30.514
So what is what would you what

00:42:30.581 --> 00:42:32.950
are your thoughts on that

00:42:33.017 --> 00:42:35.286
should we be. Utilizing other

00:42:35.352 --> 00:42:38.022
data sources should we be

00:42:38.088 --> 00:42:39.757
continuously counting instead

00:42:39.823 --> 00:42:41.458
of relying on the points I'm

00:42:41.525 --> 00:42:43.460
can I do know that had requires

00:42:43.527 --> 00:42:46.630
that but I like to know your

00:42:46.697 --> 00:42:47.197
your perspective on that. So

00:42:47.264 --> 00:42:48.198
have a clear. But the-

00:42:48.265 --> 00:42:51.635
characteristics answer this and

00:42:51.702 --> 00:42:52.269
the do not only number but the

00:42:52.336 --> 00:42:52.903
character. There is of the most

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:54.038
popular in any community is

00:42:54.104 --> 00:42:55.940
important to understand what

00:42:56.006 --> 00:42:57.141
are the right types of services

00:42:57.207 --> 00:42:57.741
mix of services to serve the

00:42:57.808 --> 00:42:58.976
population effectively. The

00:42:59.043 --> 00:43:01.312
point in time counts to provide

00:43:01.378 --> 00:43:04.181
a useful estimate- as we as we

00:43:04.248 --> 00:43:04.848
mentioned that there are so the

00:43:04.915 --> 00:43:07.651
limitations of that to the

00:43:07.718 --> 00:43:08.919
extent that other data sources

00:43:08.986 --> 00:43:09.420
can be used. To provide

00:43:09.486 --> 00:43:13.023
comprehensive picture that'll

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:14.158
just help make more informed.

00:43:14.224 --> 00:43:18.929
Is an- decisions allocate to

00:43:18.996 --> 00:43:21.465
the we would think you would

00:43:21.532 --> 00:43:21.966
agree that some point we

00:43:22.032 --> 00:43:22.599
probably should utilize utilize

00:43:22.666 --> 00:43:23.667
day says the value at. Working

00:43:23.734 --> 00:43:25.235
search image like for example

00:43:25.302 --> 00:43:27.204
they to my system I'm- on be

00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:30.040
biased here but should we be.

00:43:30.107 --> 00:43:32.309
Allow it should we should the

00:43:32.376 --> 00:43:33.911
state be collecting that data

00:43:33.978 --> 00:43:36.347
aggregating it. Does add a plea

00:43:36.413 --> 00:43:38.582
assess whether we- rooms where

00:43:38.649 --> 00:43:42.319
of funding are actually

00:43:42.386 --> 00:43:43.854
reducing homelessness yeah

00:43:43.921 --> 00:43:45.255
we've seen in the keeping have

00:43:45.322 --> 00:43:45.789
program that there are-

00:43:45.856 --> 00:43:48.158
requirements for responding to

00:43:48.225 --> 00:43:49.793
provide internet metrics on how

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:52.730
those funds are being used in

00:43:52.796 --> 00:43:53.364
for any state program we would

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:55.733
say that expect oversight is

00:43:55.799 --> 00:43:56.333
important to ensure that those

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.401
dollars are being used assembly.

00:43:57.468 --> 00:44:00.571
And in my- the rams are

00:44:00.637 --> 00:44:05.709
utilized in terms of housing-

00:44:05.776 --> 00:44:06.343
in terms of like investment in

00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:10.414
a mental health services or or

00:44:10.481 --> 00:44:12.883
or medical detox or sabes

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:16.620
prevention- are we making the

00:44:16.687 --> 00:44:17.187
proper investments and that

00:44:17.254 --> 00:44:21.058
should we be. I cal reimburse-

00:44:21.125 --> 00:44:23.660
those services. Rose in the

00:44:23.727 --> 00:44:25.696
medical community what are your

00:44:25.763 --> 00:44:27.998
thoughts on that. So home is a

00:44:28.065 --> 00:44:30.968
very complex problem into the

00:44:31.035 --> 00:44:35.139
there's no right approach one

00:44:35.205 --> 00:44:35.773
of the things that we've talked

00:44:35.839 --> 00:44:39.877
about is thinking about. What

00:44:39.943 --> 00:44:41.645
response of the state. Event

00:44:41.712 --> 00:44:43.180
plate. The state and local

00:44:43.247 --> 00:44:43.781
local governments and can be

00:44:43.847 --> 00:44:45.049
purchased and are just one way

00:44:45.115 --> 00:44:46.550
in which and gather permission

00:44:46.617 --> 00:44:47.017
to start making those

00:44:47.084 --> 00:44:51.288
decisions. What is the state

00:44:51.355 --> 00:44:53.290
role what do those programs

00:44:53.357 --> 00:44:54.024
look like are there priority

00:44:54.091 --> 00:44:54.591
prop populations that you'd

00:44:54.658 --> 00:44:57.161
want to invest some specific

00:44:57.227 --> 00:44:57.795
attention to. Us those are some

00:44:57.861 --> 00:45:01.198
things you want to. Thank you

00:45:01.265 --> 00:45:07.438
very much. That. We also just a

00:45:07.504 --> 00:45:08.906
lot of issues that you

00:45:08.972 --> 00:45:11.909
mentioned as a matter of fact

00:45:11.975 --> 00:45:15.012
and medi cal. In spite deep.

00:45:15.079 --> 00:45:15.646
Question answers so that's that

00:45:15.712 --> 00:45:18.215
are the part of other such

00:45:18.282 --> 00:45:26.256
yours so. The question. Let up

00:45:26.323 --> 00:45:26.857
the street from the promise of

00:45:26.924 --> 00:45:29.860
services. Good morning Mister

00:45:29.927 --> 00:45:32.763
chair and members- I will not

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:34.498
spend time repeating the

00:45:34.565 --> 00:45:35.132
information we've already heard

00:45:35.199 --> 00:45:36.500
about the emergency with

00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:37.568
respect to homelessness I think

00:45:37.634 --> 00:45:38.168
it's very apparent to all of

00:45:38.235 --> 00:45:42.773
us- so I do we take the

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:43.373
opportunity to talk about the

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:44.374
governor's budget proposals for

00:45:44.441 --> 00:45:47.077
this- within that context- I'm

00:45:47.144 --> 00:45:47.578
I'm January eighth the

00:45:47.644 --> 00:45:49.113
governor. And order that built

00:45:49.179 --> 00:45:51.248
upon the prior efforts you were

00:45:51.315 --> 00:45:53.050
just hearing about- to set

00:45:53.117 --> 00:45:54.685
forth a comprehensive state

00:45:54.751 --> 00:45:55.252
response to homelessness the

00:45:55.319 --> 00:45:57.020
order expedited the

00:45:57.087 --> 00:45:59.056
availability of state assets in

00:45:59.123 --> 00:46:01.191
order to help with those

00:46:01.258 --> 00:46:03.193
solutions it's stood up a state

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:05.529
this response team. Establish

00:46:05.596 --> 00:46:07.364
the new California access to

00:46:07.431 --> 00:46:09.833
housing and services fund.

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:12.503
Shortly afterward on January to

00:46:12.569 --> 00:46:14.104
the governor released his

00:46:14.171 --> 00:46:15.873
budget proposal. The budget

00:46:15.939 --> 00:46:16.373
proposes to invite seven

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.242
hundred and fifty million

00:46:18.308 --> 00:46:19.877
dollars in general fund to that

00:46:19.943 --> 00:46:20.377
new finder that I just

00:46:20.444 --> 00:46:22.746
mentioned and that's going to

00:46:22.813 --> 00:46:23.313
be the main subject of my

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:25.649
comments. But I. Mentioned that

00:46:25.716 --> 00:46:27.217
there were six hundred and

00:46:27.284 --> 00:46:27.818
ninety five million in total

00:46:27.885 --> 00:46:29.253
funds proposed for the medic

00:46:29.319 --> 00:46:31.655
how much. Your California all

00:46:31.722 --> 00:46:33.824
initiative which will address

00:46:33.891 --> 00:46:35.926
some of the- issues that Mr

00:46:35.993 --> 00:46:39.229
Fong just raising. Here is for

00:46:39.296 --> 00:46:39.730
the state to lead with

00:46:39.796 --> 00:46:40.898
resources and technical

00:46:40.964 --> 00:46:42.833
assistance but to still

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:43.500
acknowledge as we always have

00:46:43.567 --> 00:46:45.135
that local governments and the

00:46:45.202 --> 00:46:47.271
partners their- play a critical

00:46:47.337 --> 00:46:49.106
role in solutions. At the local

00:46:49.173 --> 00:46:49.540
level for all of our

00:46:49.606 --> 00:46:52.843
communities. As the minister of

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:53.443
the state safety net programs

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:55.746
and several targeted has been

00:46:55.812 --> 00:46:57.915
support and client assistance

00:46:57.981 --> 00:46:59.616
programs we believe CDSS as

00:46:59.683 --> 00:47:01.952
well positioned to carry out

00:47:02.019 --> 00:47:02.352
responsibility for

00:47:02.419 --> 00:47:04.354
administering this new access.

00:47:04.421 --> 00:47:06.023
Thing and services act and

00:47:06.089 --> 00:47:07.891
fund. Our goal is to develop

00:47:07.958 --> 00:47:09.259
mechanisms as quickly as we can

00:47:09.326 --> 00:47:11.662
so that if and as soon as a

00:47:11.728 --> 00:47:12.196
lead teacher approved the

00:47:12.262 --> 00:47:13.564
proposal we can get the funds

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:15.532
out the door. We're working

00:47:15.599 --> 00:47:15.933
toward this goal

00:47:15.999 --> 00:47:17.134
collaboratively with other

00:47:17.201 --> 00:47:19.736
state and local nurse some of

00:47:19.803 --> 00:47:23.173
whom are here today- and with

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:23.774
advocates and experts and we

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:25.809
really look forward to working

00:47:25.876 --> 00:47:26.710
with you on the details

00:47:26.777 --> 00:47:27.244
throughout the legislative

00:47:27.311 --> 00:47:30.681
process. Hopefully for- early

00:47:30.747 --> 00:47:35.452
action by the legislature. So

00:47:35.519 --> 00:47:37.287
we need- in addition to the

00:47:37.354 --> 00:47:37.854
seven hundred fifty million

00:47:37.921 --> 00:47:38.522
dollars in general fund I just

00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:39.189
one mentioned I also want to be

00:47:39.256 --> 00:47:42.092
clear that the fund is intended

00:47:42.159 --> 00:47:42.559
to be able to receive

00:47:42.626 --> 00:47:43.794
contributions from federal

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:46.530
local and private sources to

00:47:46.597 --> 00:47:49.166
augment the total resources

00:47:49.233 --> 00:47:51.134
that will be available. The

00:47:51.201 --> 00:47:53.537
resource to be used for our

00:47:53.604 --> 00:47:56.607
purposes first AB to develop

00:47:56.673 --> 00:47:57.207
additional affordable housing

00:47:57.274 --> 00:47:57.975
and work on the supply side.

00:47:58.041 --> 00:48:02.145
Second to provide such. Facing

00:48:02.212 --> 00:48:03.780
homelessness and tendency

00:48:03.847 --> 00:48:05.415
support services along with

00:48:05.482 --> 00:48:08.218
that rental sub. And third to

00:48:08.285 --> 00:48:10.187
help stabilize boarding care

00:48:10.254 --> 00:48:10.821
homes which I think Mister and

00:48:10.887 --> 00:48:11.922
you've already reference today-

00:48:11.989 --> 00:48:14.291
for individuals who require

00:48:14.358 --> 00:48:17.027
that kind of care. All of the

00:48:17.094 --> 00:48:19.663
individuals and families Sir by

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:23.767
the program will be homeless or

00:48:23.834 --> 00:48:24.201
at imminent risk of

00:48:24.268 --> 00:48:27.204
homelessness. And when his

00:48:27.271 --> 00:48:27.771
broader approach in recent

00:48:27.838 --> 00:48:29.239
years to housing and

00:48:29.306 --> 00:48:29.740
homelessness issues the

00:48:29.806 --> 00:48:31.375
services and supports will all

00:48:31.441 --> 00:48:33.443
be offered a housing first

00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:37.281
model. The intent to bring the

00:48:37.347 --> 00:48:38.448
housing separate three funds to.

00:48:38.515 --> 00:48:40.450
Services so we're improving

00:48:40.517 --> 00:48:40.951
long term outcomes in

00:48:41.018 --> 00:48:42.753
supporting individuals to not

00:48:42.819 --> 00:48:44.288
only get and obtain housing but

00:48:44.354 --> 00:48:46.690
to remain how honest.

00:48:46.757 --> 00:48:48.659
Structurally the governor's

00:48:48.725 --> 00:48:50.594
proposal is for the resources

00:48:50.661 --> 00:48:52.396
from the fund to be distributed

00:48:52.462 --> 00:48:53.697
to regional administrators.

00:48:53.764 --> 00:48:55.065
Experience and established

00:48:55.132 --> 00:48:57.100
partnerships locally with that

00:48:57.167 --> 00:48:57.634
remark I've described the

00:48:57.701 --> 00:48:59.536
regional administrators need to

00:48:59.603 --> 00:49:01.405
collaborate locally to

00:49:01.471 --> 00:49:02.005
prioritize among the needs of

00:49:02.072 --> 00:49:05.208
their regions the work of those

00:49:05.275 --> 00:49:05.809
administrators will be subject

00:49:05.876 --> 00:49:06.977
to attack on administrative

00:49:07.044 --> 00:49:09.346
costs to ensure that the

00:49:09.413 --> 00:49:09.913
overall funds are achieving

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:13.383
their intended purpose. We

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:13.884
believe critical to be

00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:15.285
innovative in our approaches to

00:49:15.352 --> 00:49:17.421
solving the problems of

00:49:17.487 --> 00:49:18.055
homelessness and the cost rate

00:49:18.121 --> 00:49:19.456
in California. The regional

00:49:19.523 --> 00:49:21.191
approach in this the proposal

00:49:21.258 --> 00:49:23.026
is intended to incentivize that

00:49:23.093 --> 00:49:25.429
collaboration. And to ensure

00:49:25.495 --> 00:49:25.962
that we're tackling these

00:49:26.029 --> 00:49:28.999
challenges within broader

00:49:29.066 --> 00:49:29.533
geographic areas that are

00:49:29.599 --> 00:49:31.468
connected to each other in

00:49:31.535 --> 00:49:34.004
terms of their need. And that

00:49:34.071 --> 00:49:36.173
residents move between. We also

00:49:36.239 --> 00:49:36.773
believe a regional approach

00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:38.208
will bring a companies a scale

00:49:38.275 --> 00:49:39.242
and allow for us to streamline

00:49:39.309 --> 00:49:41.211
key processes that we can get

00:49:41.278 --> 00:49:43.146
the funding out the door faster.

00:49:43.213 --> 00:49:43.747
Some local jurisdictions have

00:49:43.814 --> 00:49:46.917
already employed model similar

00:49:46.983 --> 00:49:49.252
to some of what is. Included in

00:49:49.319 --> 00:49:51.321
the proposal from the governor.

00:49:51.388 --> 00:49:51.922
For distributing this funding

00:49:51.988 --> 00:49:54.458
and will benefit from what

00:49:54.524 --> 00:49:56.626
they've learned as we work to

00:49:56.693 --> 00:49:58.161
and acted on a statewide level.

00:49:58.228 --> 00:50:00.964
Together our goal is to reduce

00:50:01.031 --> 00:50:01.798
St based homelessness and to

00:50:01.865 --> 00:50:06.737
increase the stability of

00:50:06.803 --> 00:50:07.270
housing for Californians.

00:50:07.337 --> 00:50:10.741
Across the state so. Overview I

00:50:10.807 --> 00:50:11.274
am also happy to take your

00:50:11.341 --> 00:50:19.449
questions. Thank you I thank

00:50:19.516 --> 00:50:22.319
both of you for your good press

00:50:22.386 --> 00:50:22.886
shins and let me start by

00:50:22.953 --> 00:50:25.756
thanking administration for

00:50:25.822 --> 00:50:26.390
putting for the proposal that

00:50:26.456 --> 00:50:28.392
does have can monies for

00:50:28.458 --> 00:50:28.959
another one time investment

00:50:29.025 --> 00:50:31.728
this year I will say I'm not. A

00:50:31.795 --> 00:50:34.097
super. To I think we the

00:50:34.164 --> 00:50:35.632
question whether that a- about

00:50:35.699 --> 00:50:36.266
obvious is a question that we

00:50:36.333 --> 00:50:37.534
will have during the budget

00:50:37.601 --> 00:50:40.003
process- I wanted to. Know a

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:44.674
little bit about who should be

00:50:44.741 --> 00:50:47.811
sort of leading the strategy. I

00:50:47.878 --> 00:50:48.378
wanted just note in the LA-

00:50:48.445 --> 00:50:50.247
report came out a few days ago.

00:50:50.313 --> 00:50:53.383
Our while the report plotted

00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:54.684
the fact that we are going to

00:50:54.751 --> 00:50:56.586
be increasing- a greater state

00:50:56.653 --> 00:50:58.855
wrong and the soonest- it

00:50:58.922 --> 00:50:59.489
suggested that even with this

00:50:59.556 --> 00:51:03.093
plan there still of a lack of a

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:05.462
cohesive approach to

00:51:05.529 --> 00:51:08.298
homelessness. At his a bit of a

00:51:08.365 --> 00:51:08.899
fright. Approach homelessness

00:51:08.965 --> 00:51:13.103
and- I know. Speaking to a lot

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:13.670
of stakeholders around the

00:51:13.737 --> 00:51:16.940
state when you have the he

00:51:17.007 --> 00:51:18.942
program focused on monies

00:51:19.009 --> 00:51:19.509
cities and continues of care

00:51:19.576 --> 00:51:20.377
when you have help money's

00:51:20.444 --> 00:51:23.747
gonna local governments and-

00:51:23.814 --> 00:51:26.283
accountability how does all

00:51:26.349 --> 00:51:28.752
this mash and so I'd love to

00:51:28.819 --> 00:51:29.352
hear from both of you. Your

00:51:29.419 --> 00:51:31.087
thoughts on who should be

00:51:31.154 --> 00:51:32.689
leading this effort how do we

00:51:32.756 --> 00:51:35.058
how do we create accountability

00:51:35.125 --> 00:51:37.194
we have so many different actor

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:39.396
stat we are. To some degree

00:51:39.463 --> 00:51:41.631
empowering- but it does feel

00:51:41.698 --> 00:51:42.199
pretty fragmented and not a

00:51:42.265 --> 00:51:48.572
cohesive. I'm so I think it's

00:51:48.638 --> 00:51:50.607
important to recognize that it

00:51:50.674 --> 00:51:52.676
takes all of us that all of the

00:51:52.742 --> 00:51:57.414
partners at the state level and

00:51:57.481 --> 00:51:58.048
the local level bring different

00:51:58.114 --> 00:51:59.716
things to the table that are

00:51:59.783 --> 00:52:01.818
necessary to confront the

00:52:01.885 --> 00:52:04.221
challenge. Internet through the

00:52:04.287 --> 00:52:06.423
state. And it's true locally so

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:07.591
we've been working very closely

00:52:07.657 --> 00:52:08.191
with our partners who operate

00:52:08.258 --> 00:52:12.963
some of those other programs.

00:52:13.029 --> 00:52:13.597
In the development of the trip

00:52:13.663 --> 00:52:14.130
bill language that we've

00:52:14.197 --> 00:52:16.500
proposed. I'm to you and we

00:52:16.566 --> 00:52:19.135
also do operate some. Graham's

00:52:19.202 --> 00:52:23.406
apartment already- so some of

00:52:23.473 --> 00:52:25.275
that fragmentation already

00:52:25.342 --> 00:52:27.677
exists- it's also important to

00:52:27.744 --> 00:52:30.247
acknowledge that. Also comes

00:52:30.313 --> 00:52:32.249
along the medi cal healthier

00:52:32.315 --> 00:52:34.751
California for all peace and so

00:52:34.818 --> 00:52:39.055
to some extent there's a lot

00:52:39.122 --> 00:52:39.689
that's happening in the housing

00:52:39.756 --> 00:52:40.257
and I think Human Services

00:52:40.323 --> 00:52:42.259
space in order to integrate the

00:52:42.325 --> 00:52:43.827
services are so that. Thing and-

00:52:43.894 --> 00:52:47.430
being housed I'm a where we

00:52:47.497 --> 00:52:48.098
have it but it is the case that

00:52:48.164 --> 00:52:50.033
we are all going to need to be

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:53.036
at the table to other locally I

00:52:53.103 --> 00:52:55.972
would say the same- are our

00:52:56.039 --> 00:52:57.007
vision is that the regional

00:52:57.073 --> 00:52:58.275
administrators will be entities

00:52:58.341 --> 00:53:01.177
that already have those

00:53:01.244 --> 00:53:03.213
partner. Be. If they are not a

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:03.813
local government themselves

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:05.482
then they certainly will need

00:53:05.549 --> 00:53:07.384
to have a history of partnering

00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:09.653
closely with. Local governments

00:53:09.719 --> 00:53:10.287
to so in some ways we are not

00:53:10.353 --> 00:53:13.056
necessarily creating something

00:53:13.123 --> 00:53:17.894
new so much. As adding another

00:53:17.961 --> 00:53:18.562
configuration of how people who

00:53:18.628 --> 00:53:20.497
are partnering together now.

00:53:20.564 --> 00:53:23.466
Can you to partner. Could you

00:53:23.533 --> 00:53:24.034
just elaborate a little bit-

00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:24.834
certainly agree with the- the

00:53:24.901 --> 00:53:27.671
hope of collaboration but- is

00:53:27.737 --> 00:53:28.238
there. Are their power seize

00:53:28.305 --> 00:53:30.707
within the trailer bill which

00:53:30.774 --> 00:53:33.877
or otherwise to really. Ensure

00:53:33.944 --> 00:53:34.411
the collaboration require

00:53:34.477 --> 00:53:35.879
accountability again from

00:53:35.946 --> 00:53:37.847
perspective are being asked to

00:53:37.914 --> 00:53:39.683
give money to different

00:53:39.749 --> 00:53:40.283
stakeholders it's just unclear

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:43.720
if. How do we ensure that what

00:53:43.787 --> 00:53:45.589
we are hoping to get on

00:53:45.655 --> 00:53:46.056
actually gets done yes

00:53:46.122 --> 00:53:47.924
appreciate that. I'm up front

00:53:47.991 --> 00:53:50.060
there is language in the

00:53:50.126 --> 00:53:52.562
trailer bill that provides-

00:53:52.629 --> 00:53:55.131
criteria that the regional

00:53:55.198 --> 00:53:55.765
administrators need to meet in

00:53:55.832 --> 00:53:58.868
order to qualify for the

00:53:58.935 --> 00:53:59.436
funding and that includes a

00:53:59.502 --> 00:54:00.136
demonstrated history of

00:54:00.203 --> 00:54:02.072
partnership- and X. specific

00:54:02.138 --> 00:54:03.907
set of experiences in the

00:54:03.974 --> 00:54:07.444
housing home the space- so. So

00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:09.546
that is one sort of layer of

00:54:09.613 --> 00:54:11.181
demonstrated partnership. Also

00:54:11.247 --> 00:54:13.483
requirement in the trailer bill

00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:15.685
for them to coordinate with

00:54:15.752 --> 00:54:17.787
with local partners to identify

00:54:17.854 --> 00:54:19.823
what is already happening and

00:54:19.889 --> 00:54:22.359
where there may be gaps so that

00:54:22.425 --> 00:54:22.959
can be blending and rating

00:54:23.026 --> 00:54:26.296
existing funding and efforts-

00:54:26.363 --> 00:54:28.932
and so that is where it would

00:54:28.999 --> 00:54:29.532
be part of the plan that they

00:54:29.599 --> 00:54:30.166
would be bringing back to the

00:54:30.233 --> 00:54:31.668
department so we will be.

00:54:31.735 --> 00:54:32.268
Reviewing and ensuring that

00:54:32.335 --> 00:54:34.437
they assessed. What is already

00:54:34.504 --> 00:54:37.207
happening with their partners

00:54:37.273 --> 00:54:38.975
with existing funding streams

00:54:39.042 --> 00:54:40.877
and that this is helping to

00:54:40.944 --> 00:54:41.411
blend braid and bridge the

00:54:41.478 --> 00:54:44.781
gaps- we also then will.

00:54:44.848 --> 00:54:47.350
Performance based contracts in

00:54:47.417 --> 00:54:49.819
those. Ability measures- which

00:54:49.886 --> 00:54:52.689
were in the process of to

00:54:52.756 --> 00:54:54.357
create right now I'm and those

00:54:54.424 --> 00:54:57.360
also will reflect whether or

00:54:57.427 --> 00:54:59.195
not they are succeeding in back

00:54:59.262 --> 00:55:01.831
collaboration. And advocacy

00:55:01.898 --> 00:55:07.203
Elio if you have any comments

00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.804
on this obvious in your report

00:55:07.871 --> 00:55:08.438
you suggest there's a bit of a

00:55:08.505 --> 00:55:09.205
lack of medicine fragmentation.

00:55:09.272 --> 00:55:11.775
And somehow we address that in

00:55:11.841 --> 00:55:14.110
I guess related to this is sort

00:55:14.177 --> 00:55:14.678
who should be leading these

00:55:14.744 --> 00:55:17.113
efforts I know for example we

00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:17.580
created the homeless

00:55:17.647 --> 00:55:19.015
coordinating council a couple

00:55:19.082 --> 00:55:22.052
years ago. They're supposed to

00:55:22.118 --> 00:55:22.652
court they have a small staff

00:55:22.719 --> 00:55:23.219
they don't have an executive

00:55:23.286 --> 00:55:25.355
director. Even help funds. Just

00:55:25.422 --> 00:55:28.992
wondering who should be driving

00:55:29.059 --> 00:55:29.893
lesson and what are the first

00:55:29.959 --> 00:55:32.328
steps that. Whoever is driving

00:55:32.395 --> 00:55:36.666
the should focus on. Recommend

00:55:36.733 --> 00:55:37.333
the legislature should to think

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:38.435
through as it develops its own

00:55:38.501 --> 00:55:41.504
strategic plan as we recommend

00:55:41.571 --> 00:55:42.105
in our report. You know as you

00:55:42.172 --> 00:55:45.709
there's there is you know that.

00:55:45.775 --> 00:55:48.211
Shin and different up as the

00:55:48.278 --> 00:55:48.812
from establish a new MacInnes

00:55:48.878 --> 00:55:50.680
of delay serve to look within

00:55:50.747 --> 00:55:51.314
the department of services. So

00:55:51.381 --> 00:55:52.982
we think that you consider the

00:55:53.049 --> 00:55:55.051
right approach you continue to

00:55:55.118 --> 00:55:55.518
leverage the existing

00:55:55.585 --> 00:55:57.287
mechanisms as a way of

00:55:57.353 --> 00:55:59.589
delivering services well you

00:55:59.656 --> 00:56:02.258
have time to think through

00:56:02.325 --> 00:56:02.892
convene individuals through the

00:56:02.959 --> 00:56:04.894
mechanisms like today. A and

00:56:04.961 --> 00:56:06.896
then make decisions about what

00:56:06.963 --> 00:56:07.397
is the right state role

00:56:07.464 --> 00:56:08.598
considering what are your your

00:56:08.665 --> 00:56:09.232
goals and priorities and making

00:56:09.299 --> 00:56:10.133
sure that you have solution.

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:12.001
With but it is difficult task

00:56:12.068 --> 00:56:12.602
and one that we don't have a

00:56:12.669 --> 00:56:16.473
ready made solution. Which is

00:56:16.539 --> 00:56:17.107
why we think that sort of take

00:56:17.173 --> 00:56:20.844
the time to. Make think the

00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:21.411
those decisions and- years

00:56:21.478 --> 00:56:23.580
sometimes existing mechanism

00:56:23.646 --> 00:56:26.783
provide. In the near term leave

00:56:26.850 --> 00:56:27.283
to local governments is

00:56:27.350 --> 00:56:28.118
important. And in the long term

00:56:28.184 --> 00:56:29.853
providing that strategy. For

00:56:29.919 --> 00:56:33.757
how to set this. It's making me

00:56:33.823 --> 00:56:35.458
productions. Address the

00:56:35.525 --> 00:56:38.061
homelessness process. In the

00:56:38.128 --> 00:56:52.342
long run. Thank you. Thanks

00:56:52.408 --> 00:56:55.078
thank you I think you very much

00:56:55.145 --> 00:56:58.148
for the prison so I think it's

00:56:58.214 --> 00:57:02.352
law that guy has set up up for

00:57:02.418 --> 00:57:03.987
to of this proposal for three

00:57:04.053 --> 00:57:07.557
quarters of a billion. My

00:57:07.624 --> 00:57:12.061
overriding a can. Is that it's

00:57:12.128 --> 00:57:12.695
one time and that the I'm is in

00:57:12.762 --> 00:57:17.834
so. Up with the that there's

00:57:17.901 --> 00:57:19.936
real no amount that would be

00:57:20.003 --> 00:57:23.673
serve. Today however. I think

00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:27.777
we need to do deep and find

00:57:27.844 --> 00:57:34.017
more a resource. Excuse me. A

00:57:34.083 --> 00:57:38.121
and to that are on in nature

00:57:38.188 --> 00:57:44.160
and- the other I that I ask you

00:57:44.227 --> 00:57:47.497
address is but there's really a

00:57:47.564 --> 00:57:48.097
I think you talked a lot bit

00:57:48.164 --> 00:57:49.432
about but there's a lack of

00:57:49.499 --> 00:57:51.835
specificity in the right now

00:57:51.901 --> 00:57:54.037
and I think if I understand a

00:57:54.103 --> 00:57:55.271
correct we're out allege. To

00:57:55.338 --> 00:57:57.774
appropriate this money now with

00:57:57.841 --> 00:57:58.408
the understand figure out later

00:57:58.474 --> 00:58:02.011
with space is and that is.

00:58:02.078 --> 00:58:04.948
Really not something as the

00:58:05.014 --> 00:58:07.517
chairman of her put up in a

00:58:07.584 --> 00:58:09.152
member this can that. AJ does

00:58:09.219 --> 00:58:12.188
not work me so how would you

00:58:12.255 --> 00:58:14.991
propose that we align ourselves

00:58:15.058 --> 00:58:20.029
a- providing. The visitor of.

00:58:20.096 --> 00:58:22.565
In the but process so we know

00:58:22.632 --> 00:58:26.069
we approve the by so in June we

00:58:26.135 --> 00:58:30.540
know what we're gonna. And then

00:58:30.607 --> 00:58:33.910
I have some specific on how the

00:58:33.977 --> 00:58:36.045
governor said the image is so

00:58:36.112 --> 00:58:43.219
proposed to al. Thank I'm so

00:58:43.286 --> 00:58:43.853
with your to your for point on

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:46.990
on research Hey I certain your

00:58:47.056 --> 00:58:47.523
not the only one that I've

00:58:47.590 --> 00:58:48.124
heard already at the morning

00:58:48.191 --> 00:58:50.994
meant that an I think they the

00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:53.229
sort of I'm going. I goal for

00:58:53.296 --> 00:58:55.531
the state in it find those on

00:58:55.598 --> 00:58:59.002
resources with the Kern economy

00:58:59.068 --> 00:59:01.204
and to the I'm sure of what

00:59:01.271 --> 00:59:03.106
those resources are gonna be

00:59:03.172 --> 00:59:04.274
going for so the per this.

00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:07.677
Winter we went to funding but

00:59:07.744 --> 00:59:10.246
it does allow for invest and in

00:59:10.313 --> 00:59:12.248
addition to the resources they

00:59:12.315 --> 00:59:16.152
mention earlier from from so

00:59:16.219 --> 00:59:21.124
including per. And I think that

00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:23.393
that I. Is that is that it cap.

00:59:23.459 --> 00:59:26.229
For that as we- and then it.

00:59:26.296 --> 00:59:32.168
Wait how. The some king we have

00:59:32.235 --> 00:59:32.802
an on going out to evaluate is

00:59:32.869 --> 00:59:33.970
work as we continue to move and

00:59:34.037 --> 00:59:34.604
for I do think the problem will

00:59:34.671 --> 00:59:36.339
be so. Within the- year or a

00:59:36.406 --> 00:59:36.906
couple of the said this is

00:59:36.973 --> 00:59:39.342
going to be an on going even

00:59:39.409 --> 00:59:40.243
though despite resources are

00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:43.012
when time in the and with

00:59:43.079 --> 00:59:43.980
respect to the of space. We

00:59:44.047 --> 00:59:47.717
really look working with you

00:59:47.784 --> 00:59:48.351
and your Ste to try to down.

00:59:48.418 --> 00:59:52.021
The particular are you would

00:59:52.088 --> 00:59:52.655
like to be clear about it we've

00:59:52.722 --> 00:59:54.791
had. Any and- calm some of

00:59:54.857 --> 00:59:58.895
those my detail come. To it is

00:59:58.962 --> 01:00:01.064
that we- vita what we hope is

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:06.602
in France. I'm a for a program

01:00:06.669 --> 01:00:07.236
that were from to and I'd post

01:00:07.303 --> 01:00:10.473
for the most could piece but we

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:11.140
certainly well additional input.

01:00:11.207 --> 01:00:12.475
You know they are to have a

01:00:12.542 --> 01:00:21.184
calm about any just. Brown yes

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:22.919
aren't kids that the for is a

01:00:22.986 --> 01:00:24.387
stands today does per a bit of

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:24.921
discrepancy department of

01:00:24.988 --> 01:00:26.856
social service and our CASF and

01:00:26.923 --> 01:00:31.327
what are we that you know since

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:32.996
about the number of region's

01:00:33.062 --> 01:00:35.264
the with government raising the

01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:37.066
as the funds are one that sort

01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:38.801
of merit you gosh over the

01:00:38.868 --> 01:00:41.571
coming extended the pledge.

01:00:41.637 --> 01:00:43.573
Thirty is was are things that

01:00:43.639 --> 01:00:47.310
can be. Into the old land. And

01:00:47.377 --> 01:00:49.779
establish the program. Action

01:00:49.846 --> 01:00:50.380
the legislature would want to

01:00:50.446 --> 01:00:52.148
go into the to the beyond that

01:00:52.215 --> 01:00:54.884
sort of bigger picture. Those

01:00:54.951 --> 01:00:57.120
are six similar press that have

01:00:57.186 --> 01:00:57.687
been set on of approach the

01:00:57.754 --> 01:01:01.524
stay has is to delegate revenue.

01:01:01.591 --> 01:01:03.259
At two local got to their home

01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:08.731
and serve to this is that there

01:01:08.798 --> 01:01:09.365
are certain areas of the law.

01:01:09.432 --> 01:01:09.999
You could continue to use this

01:01:10.066 --> 01:01:10.600
model that we place today to

01:01:10.666 --> 01:01:15.004
delay those things are.

01:01:15.071 --> 01:01:18.775
Priorities the you let me into

01:01:18.841 --> 01:01:20.410
the specific at least as stand

01:01:20.476 --> 01:01:24.213
kind of book that the

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.482
administration of. Oppose it

01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:28.284
when I first the a proposed I

01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:32.088
re that of the purchase of foot

01:01:32.155 --> 01:01:36.893
motor. Properties we be. One of

01:01:36.959 --> 01:01:39.128
the priorities to at I think

01:01:39.195 --> 01:01:41.864
you I it as affordable how per.

01:01:41.931 --> 01:01:45.168
And. Eight would like to know

01:01:45.234 --> 01:01:47.036
Sir of where the admit is on

01:01:47.103 --> 01:01:55.778
the specific right now. So with

01:01:55.845 --> 01:01:58.247
for to the of housing

01:01:58.314 --> 01:01:58.714
development they is a

01:01:58.781 --> 01:01:59.315
difference in the trailer bill

01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:00.083
and I was just look for that's

01:02:00.149 --> 01:02:03.820
fine although sage. Which is to

01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:06.322
the to being of the re use of

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:10.059
for are possible and that made

01:02:10.126 --> 01:02:10.693
things some of what you are top

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:11.327
about. So I think there's an op

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:12.895
both with for to property but

01:02:12.962 --> 01:02:17.934
all. To men to take in every

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:26.809
using exist. Number for. Our

01:02:26.876 --> 01:02:28.911
for. Affordable and I is a said

01:02:28.978 --> 01:02:30.113
that continue to be. Arm and

01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:42.225
anticipate use. He said ugh

01:02:42.291 --> 01:02:42.859
sometimes nexus of stern fifty

01:02:42.925 --> 01:02:48.131
thousand dollars in called. Do.

01:02:48.197 --> 01:02:49.765
It's extremely important that

01:02:49.832 --> 01:02:53.536
we do that but- please to post

01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:58.007
now it's not gonna go very far

01:02:58.074 --> 01:03:01.811
that's how we allocate it. That

01:03:01.878 --> 01:03:02.378
point that there is also a

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:02.979
reference in the trailer bill

01:03:03.045 --> 01:03:05.815
to the fact that- uses. And

01:03:05.882 --> 01:03:06.449
where we would be establishing

01:03:06.516 --> 01:03:07.783
a dollar threshold to ensure

01:03:07.850 --> 01:03:09.685
that the funds are not over

01:03:09.752 --> 01:03:12.121
Rendon subsumed by only that

01:03:12.188 --> 01:03:14.557
use because we want a balance

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:17.160
between the uses that are

01:03:17.226 --> 01:03:21.531
proposed. Thank you a not- use

01:03:21.597 --> 01:03:24.867
the funds was the for a board

01:03:24.934 --> 01:03:27.136
and care- as I think we both

01:03:27.203 --> 01:03:30.006
took a disk. It's an important

01:03:30.072 --> 01:03:33.509
issue- that needs to be

01:03:33.576 --> 01:03:37.446
addressed. Do you have a- CERN.

01:03:37.513 --> 01:03:40.683
And that is the board care

01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:45.788
crisis- is. One of our- it is

01:03:45.855 --> 01:03:51.093
it it's broader than- just

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:55.665
homelessness in of affecting- a

01:03:55.731 --> 01:04:01.470
seniors so of the disabled- on

01:04:01.537 --> 01:04:04.473
other categories of

01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:07.843
individuals- who are not

01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:10.279
necessarily. I threatened with

01:04:10.346 --> 01:04:14.217
homeless. It's a- this that.

01:04:14.283 --> 01:04:19.322
I'm not so sure the so in to

01:04:19.388 --> 01:04:23.759
the boarding the cry autumn.

01:04:23.826 --> 01:04:24.427
Inside of this particular fund

01:04:24.493 --> 01:04:25.661
it probably have its own

01:04:25.728 --> 01:04:30.733
discrete funding source. I have

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:33.202
just one on this issue so and

01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:36.872
as I've already spoken about it

01:04:36.939 --> 01:04:39.108
today- I don't want to diminish

01:04:39.175 --> 01:04:40.543
the importance of it and take

01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:44.847
away funding from. Up providing

01:04:44.914 --> 01:04:46.482
solutions but I think there it

01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:49.652
may be back up some separation.

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:50.253
I don't know if you have any

01:04:50.319 --> 01:04:51.554
comments on that but it. I

01:04:51.621 --> 01:04:55.024
think something we should be

01:04:55.091 --> 01:04:56.892
thinking about sure well we

01:04:56.959 --> 01:04:57.526
are- department social services

01:04:57.593 --> 01:04:58.828
we are also the licensing

01:04:58.894 --> 01:05:00.296
entity for our facility which

01:05:00.363 --> 01:05:02.131
three. It was a- mental

01:05:02.198 --> 01:05:04.467
facilities in a and residential

01:05:04.533 --> 01:05:06.836
facility for the elderly- and

01:05:06.902 --> 01:05:10.006
that capacity we are licensing

01:05:10.072 --> 01:05:12.708
division does work- quite a bit

01:05:12.775 --> 01:05:13.809
the licensees who are

01:05:13.876 --> 01:05:15.711
experiencing challenges in

01:05:15.778 --> 01:05:16.245
keeping their doors open

01:05:16.312 --> 01:05:17.113
technical system passed city

01:05:17.179 --> 01:05:20.116
already- so some of that work

01:05:20.182 --> 01:05:20.750
is happening and we're happy to

01:05:20.816 --> 01:05:21.884
collaborate with you. To try to

01:05:21.951 --> 01:05:24.320
get what we've I'm not ext. How

01:05:24.387 --> 01:05:26.222
to gap and with respect to this

01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:28.324
specific uses from the fund the

01:05:28.391 --> 01:05:31.827
idea is that. It may be for

01:05:31.894 --> 01:05:33.496
example an operating subsidy or

01:05:33.562 --> 01:05:36.265
of a rental subsidy- but it is

01:05:36.332 --> 01:05:38.801
intended to be targeted to the

01:05:38.868 --> 01:05:41.304
facilities that are serving

01:05:41.370 --> 01:05:42.004
this population so there is

01:05:42.071 --> 01:05:43.806
sort of a larger category of

01:05:43.873 --> 01:05:44.440
the burden care facilities. And

01:05:44.507 --> 01:05:46.809
there is a subset of them that

01:05:46.876 --> 01:05:47.777
specific service population so

01:05:47.843 --> 01:05:48.277
that's the focus for the

01:05:48.344 --> 01:05:50.813
specific use of the fine but

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:53.215
again happy to work with you on

01:05:53.282 --> 01:05:55.151
all fronts. And I think chair

01:05:55.217 --> 01:05:55.718
of the larger. It's hard to

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:57.953
mean interrupt you but- therein

01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:00.856
lies the problem before only

01:06:00.923 --> 01:06:04.460
addressing that subset. Of risk

01:06:04.527 --> 01:06:07.196
for. Of a much broader crisis

01:06:07.263 --> 01:06:15.071
that needs to be addressed. The

01:06:15.137 --> 01:06:21.744
third tab- a bucket of money I

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:23.379
or up to of this money was used.

01:06:23.446 --> 01:06:26.315
Since some. I think. Xin aspect

01:06:26.382 --> 01:06:29.485
of how is something that we

01:06:29.552 --> 01:06:35.791
haven't done enough of- and to

01:06:35.858 --> 01:06:36.425
of the more people we keep from

01:06:36.492 --> 01:06:41.063
entering homelessness the of

01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:41.697
clearly the better off we and

01:06:41.764 --> 01:06:45.401
it's a much much more. You very

01:06:45.468 --> 01:06:47.002
limited reap in. The at least

01:06:47.069 --> 01:06:49.772
in some of the increase the

01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:50.339
dramatic increase that we're

01:06:50.406 --> 01:06:52.708
seeing in homelessness is

01:06:52.775 --> 01:06:54.577
largely due to people who are

01:06:54.643 --> 01:06:57.747
newly entering says because

01:06:57.813 --> 01:07:01.984
they have. Issue with their

01:07:02.051 --> 01:07:02.585
ability to make that law the

01:07:02.651 --> 01:07:04.620
rent payment- things of that

01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:09.592
nature- so I want. To more

01:07:09.658 --> 01:07:12.128
focus on. On that particular

01:07:12.194 --> 01:07:14.730
expected. Which for. Answers to

01:07:14.797 --> 01:07:17.066
questions. Thank you. For I

01:07:17.133 --> 01:07:19.668
just a few questions I but I

01:07:19.735 --> 01:07:22.138
certainly want- a day I

01:07:22.204 --> 01:07:24.173
appreciate the governor coming

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.674
to Bakersfield a few months

01:07:25.741 --> 01:07:28.110
back and we only had a

01:07:28.177 --> 01:07:28.944
conversation of about a number.

01:07:29.011 --> 01:07:31.180
In terms of it I just to piggy

01:07:31.247 --> 01:07:33.249
back on. He blames question we

01:07:33.315 --> 01:07:35.818
did have a come in about stable

01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:37.520
funding is there is there and

01:07:37.586 --> 01:07:38.821
discussions and imitation about

01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:41.056
looking at a five year plan to

01:07:41.123 --> 01:07:43.726
try to as as LA outlined maybe

01:07:43.793 --> 01:07:45.561
putting together- a more

01:07:45.628 --> 01:07:50.533
coordinated effort and funding

01:07:50.599 --> 01:07:51.100
that so that their stability

01:07:51.167 --> 01:07:52.401
for the providers- if your-

01:07:52.468 --> 01:07:56.806
goal is. See you. Lies yeah.

01:07:56.872 --> 01:07:59.442
Aboard if it's to be more-

01:07:59.508 --> 01:08:02.478
housing. What housing on online

01:08:02.545 --> 01:08:05.147
that can't be done in in one

01:08:05.214 --> 01:08:05.781
year is there a conversation to

01:08:05.848 --> 01:08:09.618
do that as I mean actually

01:08:09.685 --> 01:08:10.219
deferred to- alley who I think

01:08:10.286 --> 01:08:11.821
it's gonna be a expand. AB

01:08:11.887 --> 01:08:14.156
council believe please being

01:08:14.223 --> 01:08:17.059
some did you do planning that

01:08:17.126 --> 01:08:17.693
you can prop speak to okay when

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.428
she's here you did highlight-

01:08:19.495 --> 01:08:21.430
that you were developing simple

01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:23.065
space measures- within can can

01:08:23.132 --> 01:08:27.336
you. Shed some light on what

01:08:27.403 --> 01:08:29.271
was will look like a- Hey is it

01:08:29.338 --> 01:08:31.173
still be a teasing that out in

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:31.841
a you know yeah cat let us know

01:08:31.907 --> 01:08:34.844
what it is or are you a it was

01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:35.377
a more information yeah

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:36.145
absolutely wheelchair it I

01:08:36.212 --> 01:08:38.147
don't I'm not prepared here

01:08:38.214 --> 01:08:39.849
today to sort of provide the-

01:08:39.915 --> 01:08:40.483
lines of what specifically it

01:08:40.549 --> 01:08:42.251
is but we have been looking at

01:08:42.318 --> 01:08:42.751
the other programs that

01:08:42.818 --> 01:08:44.320
already. This the data that's-

01:08:44.386 --> 01:08:46.522
as you mentioned in my and also

01:08:46.589 --> 01:08:47.957
outside of a time I. S. it.

01:08:48.023 --> 01:08:52.361
Came with reporters what is.

01:08:52.428 --> 01:08:52.962
Cooley and trying to sort of.

01:08:53.028 --> 01:08:55.631
Pull all of that together into

01:08:55.698 --> 01:08:57.833
what could be a meaningful way

01:08:57.900 --> 01:09:01.337
to measure success. So we will

01:09:01.403 --> 01:09:02.171
absolutely share more of that

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:02.671
information so there's a

01:09:02.738 --> 01:09:04.206
conversation using HMIS and

01:09:04.273 --> 01:09:04.840
other data points the terms of

01:09:04.907 --> 01:09:06.075
the term. Before their- which

01:09:06.141 --> 01:09:08.077
is. I am we want to rely the

01:09:08.143 --> 01:09:10.045
edge of my data Sanders we

01:09:10.112 --> 01:09:10.613
don't wanna. The will or we

01:09:10.679 --> 01:09:12.448
don't need to but we also

01:09:12.515 --> 01:09:14.049
recognize that not everything

01:09:14.116 --> 01:09:17.119
that we are going to want and

01:09:17.186 --> 01:09:17.686
need to collect information

01:09:17.753 --> 01:09:20.356
about a already be captured.

01:09:20.422 --> 01:09:20.956
Okay and my last question in

01:09:21.023 --> 01:09:21.891
terms of and they certainly.

01:09:21.957 --> 01:09:23.959
There are or realities that are

01:09:24.026 --> 01:09:26.228
different in terms of urban

01:09:26.295 --> 01:09:26.695
homelessness and rule

01:09:26.762 --> 01:09:27.296
homelessness it certainly in

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:28.063
the real committees

01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:30.232
transportations in is an issue-

01:09:30.299 --> 01:09:32.101
more more spread out- at. Is

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:34.036
there recognition within the

01:09:34.103 --> 01:09:36.038
governor's proposal of about

01:09:36.105 --> 01:09:38.607
the- ensuring that the rule

01:09:38.674 --> 01:09:39.742
committees also. Receive

01:09:39.808 --> 01:09:41.877
adequate funding this is

01:09:41.944 --> 01:09:44.179
certainly I will concede the

01:09:44.246 --> 01:09:45.915
point that a said as a- as- a

01:09:45.981 --> 01:09:48.217
portion and we've not most of

01:09:48.284 --> 01:09:48.751
homelessness is it. Open

01:09:48.817 --> 01:09:53.055
centers but- a how do you how

01:09:53.122 --> 01:09:55.858
do you how do you. Yeah that

01:09:55.925 --> 01:09:56.725
would it would save is that the

01:09:56.792 --> 01:09:59.895
trailer bill outlines- factors

01:09:59.962 --> 01:10:00.429
for the allocation of the

01:10:00.496 --> 01:10:02.131
funding. They in the pick

01:10:02.197 --> 01:10:02.798
county of homelessness but they

01:10:02.865 --> 01:10:04.266
are doing digital housing needs

01:10:04.333 --> 01:10:06.602
assessment. And in the to the

01:10:06.669 --> 01:10:08.237
right burden- that individual

01:10:08.304 --> 01:10:10.339
are facing a community so it's

01:10:10.406 --> 01:10:10.940
it is an attempt to sort of

01:10:11.006 --> 01:10:12.141
comprehensively look at the

01:10:12.207 --> 01:10:13.976
factors that are leading to the

01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:14.410
cost crisis. And to

01:10:14.476 --> 01:10:16.478
homelessness across the state

01:10:16.545 --> 01:10:18.714
okay and one last question and

01:10:18.781 --> 01:10:19.281
in terms of the governor's

01:10:19.348 --> 01:10:22.551
proposal to expand Medicaid al-

01:10:22.618 --> 01:10:24.486
to include and booze preventive

01:10:24.553 --> 01:10:26.922
health care can you expand on a

01:10:26.989 --> 01:10:28.724
what it wouldn't. Include the

01:10:28.791 --> 01:10:32.161
taxes include a metal services

01:10:32.227 --> 01:10:33.462
counseling services abuse Iggy

01:10:33.529 --> 01:10:35.397
is out on the table so I'm

01:10:35.464 --> 01:10:37.800
afraid I have to defer to

01:10:37.866 --> 01:10:40.202
probably three nine year and

01:10:40.269 --> 01:10:40.836
within the department of health

01:10:40.903 --> 01:10:42.705
care services to talk more

01:10:42.771 --> 01:10:45.541
about it I think that that in

01:10:45.608 --> 01:10:49.111
broad strokes. The point is to

01:10:49.178 --> 01:10:49.645
integrate eight physical.

01:10:49.712 --> 01:10:50.279
Health services for individuals

01:10:50.346 --> 01:10:52.715
with needs and- cost. Jackie

01:10:52.781 --> 01:10:53.949
what that's going to look at I

01:10:54.016 --> 01:10:54.550
know they going. Subcommittee

01:10:54.617 --> 01:10:56.752
hearing next we and I believe

01:10:56.819 --> 01:10:57.386
that's right. Will be there for

01:10:57.453 --> 01:10:58.020
that. I hope they will be a to

01:10:58.087 --> 01:11:00.255
share more with you about that.

01:11:00.322 --> 01:11:00.856
Thank you I also had a- few

01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:02.758
questions as well- just wanted

01:11:02.825 --> 01:11:03.959
to get into the- issue

01:11:04.026 --> 01:11:06.195
regarding why the department

01:11:06.261 --> 01:11:08.130
was chosen. To leave this

01:11:08.197 --> 01:11:10.132
effort could you describe to me

01:11:10.199 --> 01:11:13.168
what efforts on the department

01:11:13.235 --> 01:11:13.769
handles in terms of affordable

01:11:13.836 --> 01:11:18.374
housing development. But we

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:18.974
don't currently have programs

01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:23.512
that that- focused on the

01:11:23.579 --> 01:11:25.547
housing development per se what

01:11:25.614 --> 01:11:26.048
we have our housing and

01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:27.516
homelessness programs that

01:11:27.583 --> 01:11:30.753
targets but take populations-

01:11:30.819 --> 01:11:33.055
and matching them to have it

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:34.990
and so they- need to work at

01:11:35.057 --> 01:11:40.396
the local level we- I'm-

01:11:40.462 --> 01:11:40.896
there's and with other

01:11:40.963 --> 01:11:41.563

partnering with others within

01:11:50.205 --> 01:11:53.275
the state who do you have that

01:11:53.342 --> 01:11:56.478
experience- and we already have

01:11:56.545 --> 01:11:59.481
been in the development trailer

01:11:59.548 --> 01:12:01.984

that and given that this is.

01:14:45.113 --> 01:14:51.887
Only one time funding are how

01:14:51.954 --> 01:14:53.589

and completed financial

01:14:59.995 --> 01:15:02.164
services I'm so is so what we

01:15:02.231 --> 01:15:02.831
would be doing is releasing an

01:15:02.898 --> 01:15:04.366
RFP to the regional

01:15:04.433 --> 01:15:06.401
administrators would apply a we

01:15:06.468 --> 01:15:09.271
will grant the funding-

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:09.838
allocated across the region

01:15:09.905 --> 01:15:13.008
advance two eight one regional

01:15:13.075 --> 01:15:16.778
administrator per region and

01:15:16.845 --> 01:15:21.817
will be identifying based. That

01:15:21.884 --> 01:15:22.417
I described and the specific

01:15:22.484 --> 01:15:24.887
server they think are most

01:15:24.953 --> 01:15:29.224
needed locally so an example of

01:15:29.291 --> 01:15:31.260
tendency support services might

01:15:31.326 --> 01:15:34.162
be legal services- they might

01:15:34.229 --> 01:15:34.763
be mediation between the land

01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:35.697
more than Ste our housing

01:15:35.764 --> 01:15:37.165
navigation service those things

01:15:37.232 --> 01:15:39.534
were in. Talk about tennis

01:15:39.601 --> 01:15:42.604
service. In regional ministers

01:15:42.671 --> 01:15:46.742

we- have drafted something

01:16:37.159 --> 01:16:39.962
that's working its way through

01:16:40.028 --> 01:16:40.595
the administration and that we

01:16:52.107 --> 01:16:52.674
the most appropriate based on

01:16:52.741 --> 01:16:54.376

in the trailer bill the factors

01:17:04.086 --> 01:17:06.655

01:17:21.069 --> 01:17:22.771
earlier in broad. Strokes with

01:17:22.838 --> 01:17:24.106
the need to have a history all

01:17:24.172 --> 01:17:26.942
go out. To have a history of-

01:17:27.009 --> 01:17:30.645
understanding how supply. In

01:17:30.712 --> 01:17:33.081
the region- they need to have a

01:17:33.148 --> 01:17:33.682
demonstrated history of local

01:17:33.749 --> 01:17:38.453
partnerships- that position

01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:39.087
them well on and we need to be

01:17:39.154 --> 01:17:42.024
able to demonstrate why they

01:17:42.090 --> 01:17:43.525
can operate across the region.

01:17:43.592 --> 01:17:45.360
In is in is there a reason why

01:17:45.427 --> 01:17:48.196
this is a- you're pretty

01:17:48.263 --> 01:17:49.631
significant archer from the

01:17:49.698 --> 01:17:50.499
infrastructure that's already

01:17:50.565 --> 01:17:54.336
in place around. Homelessness

01:17:54.403 --> 01:17:56.304
the team is of care which is an

01:17:56.371 --> 01:17:58.507
existing for deck zero reason

01:17:58.573 --> 01:17:59.975
for that departure I'm the

01:18:00.042 --> 01:18:02.044
reason the departure is that we

01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:02.677
are trying to approach is on a

01:18:02.744 --> 01:18:04.246
regional basis and so there is

01:18:04.312 --> 01:18:06.481
no entity at this point that

01:18:06.548 --> 01:18:08.717
would cut across the regions in

01:18:08.784 --> 01:18:10.318
the way that we are looking for

01:18:10.385 --> 01:18:12.387
having said that I entirely

01:18:12.454 --> 01:18:14.089
possible that a continuum of

01:18:14.156 --> 01:18:16.391
care or consortium of them may

01:18:16.458 --> 01:18:18.226
be an applicant to be a

01:18:18.293 --> 01:18:20.262
regional administrator so how

01:18:20.328 --> 01:18:22.631
far we are departing- or not it

01:18:22.697 --> 01:18:26.068
depends in part what entities

01:18:26.134 --> 01:18:27.936
come forward and are. The con

01:18:28.003 --> 01:18:32.374
performance space. In the

01:18:32.441 --> 01:18:34.142
previous two years there is a

01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:36.211
certain structure around the

01:18:36.278 --> 01:18:39.014
funding for homelessness- did

01:18:39.081 --> 01:18:42.984
this would stop that funding to

01:18:43.051 --> 01:18:46.188
county cities CEO sees and then

01:18:46.254 --> 01:18:51.993
start to non funding is there a-

01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:55.797
why that is in terms of- that.

01:18:55.864 --> 01:18:56.398
That's significant a departure

01:18:56.465 --> 01:18:57.999
for the previous two years I'm

01:18:58.066 --> 01:19:00.001
again we are attempting to

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:02.170
innovate and to address this at

01:19:02.237 --> 01:19:05.774
a regional level- and so the

01:19:05.841 --> 01:19:07.943
structure is slightly different

01:19:08.009 --> 01:19:09.978
under this proposal and we will

01:19:10.045 --> 01:19:10.612
be collecting the data and out

01:19:10.679 --> 01:19:13.815
comes to identify how that

01:19:13.882 --> 01:19:16.218
works out. I'm we think that it

01:19:16.284 --> 01:19:18.320
it is important address it on a

01:19:18.386 --> 01:19:19.921
regional level- and we expect

01:19:19.988 --> 01:19:22.457
all of those existing partners

01:19:22.524 --> 01:19:24.559
and all of the work that they

01:19:24.626 --> 01:19:26.294
are doing and have done to be

01:19:26.361 --> 01:19:28.330
leveraged in this new

01:19:28.396 --> 01:19:28.964
configuration and for them to

01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:29.965
be fully at the table and

01:19:30.031 --> 01:19:32.200
benefiting. From the infusion

01:19:32.267 --> 01:19:34.069
of these additional resources

01:19:34.136 --> 01:19:36.004
so I really really want to

01:19:36.071 --> 01:19:38.006
emphasize that we don't feel

01:19:38.073 --> 01:19:38.573
like we are departing from

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:41.409
lying on we want to build upon.

01:19:41.476 --> 01:19:44.179
What is already happening but

01:19:44.246 --> 01:19:44.779
was the real issue trying to

01:19:44.846 --> 01:19:47.782
address. I'm if people across

01:19:47.849 --> 01:19:48.450
regions and the degree to which

01:19:48.517 --> 01:19:52.254
all this if you look at. The

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:52.888
chart that lord aside and in

01:19:52.954 --> 01:19:54.623
her hand out I think you see

01:19:54.689 --> 01:19:56.992
the concentrations they don't

01:19:57.058 --> 01:20:00.028
really and each county line to

01:20:00.095 --> 01:20:03.298
reach continuum of care pine.

01:20:03.365 --> 01:20:04.199
So is it that you're saying

01:20:04.266 --> 01:20:06.401
that you're finding that be to.

01:20:06.468 --> 01:20:11.506
Says moving from LA to orange

01:20:11.573 --> 01:20:13.942
in Orange LA can worker to.

01:20:14.009 --> 01:20:18.980
Tulare I guess that's I'm just

01:20:19.047 --> 01:20:19.614
understand what probably trying

01:20:19.681 --> 01:20:21.082
to solve at at I don't know the

01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:23.685
we have is data source to point

01:20:23.752 --> 01:20:24.286
for you other than Anneke and

01:20:24.352 --> 01:20:26.955
based on what we are finding in

01:20:27.022 --> 01:20:28.056
the programs that we operate is

01:20:28.123 --> 01:20:31.927
how it works but okay when it

01:20:31.993 --> 01:20:34.396
these talk about this. Because

01:20:34.462 --> 01:20:37.866
we- if you talk to all of us I

01:20:37.933 --> 01:20:39.601
think we'll three housing is

01:20:39.668 --> 01:20:40.168
originally is so makes sense

01:20:40.235 --> 01:20:42.204
that we have been to approach

01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:44.372
the construction of housing as

01:20:44.439 --> 01:20:47.609
well as the construction of.

01:20:47.676 --> 01:20:48.210
Facilities for the homeless in

01:20:48.276 --> 01:20:52.147
a regional matter where which-

01:20:52.214 --> 01:20:54.282
told me. Cities and counties

01:20:54.349 --> 01:20:54.883
more accountable I'm trying to

01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:58.720
just. I I'm I'm not quite

01:20:58.787 --> 01:21:00.355
understanding what the regional

01:21:00.422 --> 01:21:02.490
homeless issue that you're

01:21:02.557 --> 01:21:04.059
strides all for that we're

01:21:04.125 --> 01:21:05.527
giving you. Seven hundred fifty

01:21:05.594 --> 01:21:06.061
million dollars with no

01:21:06.127 --> 01:21:09.731
performance measures with- that

01:21:09.798 --> 01:21:11.166
we've seen yet the word and you

01:21:11.233 --> 01:21:13.468
know are that we are expecting

01:21:13.535 --> 01:21:15.837
to expecting to use performance

01:21:15.904 --> 01:21:17.105
based contracts that will have

01:21:17.172 --> 01:21:17.706
very specific metrics and we

01:21:17.772 --> 01:21:19.474
will absolutely they're more

01:21:19.541 --> 01:21:20.041
information. About those in

01:21:20.108 --> 01:21:21.943
metrics in you must take a

01:21:22.010 --> 01:21:23.945
action without metric without

01:21:24.012 --> 01:21:25.614
the region's. Without

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:29.751
specificity on regional

01:21:29.818 --> 01:21:32.120
administrators so again what's

01:21:32.187 --> 01:21:33.822
the regional you're trying to

01:21:33.888 --> 01:21:35.523
solve we will be providing you

01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:36.091
with much of the information

01:21:36.157 --> 01:21:38.126
that you were just- referencing

01:21:38.193 --> 01:21:40.428
before we would have to take

01:21:40.495 --> 01:21:45.033
action so the regional break

01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:45.600
on. The allegations that we

01:21:45.667 --> 01:21:49.004
expect for those is the

01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:49.571
performance thanks are all

01:21:49.638 --> 01:21:52.440
things that were actively on

01:21:52.507 --> 01:22:02.584
it. For you I think. Sweat.

01:22:02.651 --> 01:22:05.787
What is the regional this try

01:22:05.854 --> 01:22:06.421
to. I seeing a distant I mean

01:22:06.488 --> 01:22:11.092
as you I am the how problem and

01:22:11.159 --> 01:22:11.726
that is for regional planning

01:22:11.793 --> 01:22:13.728
how is a- it was very to the

01:22:13.795 --> 01:22:15.463
way that I just that. As a

01:22:15.530 --> 01:22:16.898
state need to tack across the

01:22:16.965 --> 01:22:17.499
whole state within regions and

01:22:17.565 --> 01:22:19.768
within. Is continue there are

01:22:19.834 --> 01:22:20.368
many ways that we have. The

01:22:20.435 --> 01:22:24.873
jeep V. and we're to innovate

01:22:24.939 --> 01:22:26.608
and do it in a slightly

01:22:26.675 --> 01:22:27.175
different way but with all

01:22:27.242 --> 01:22:30.679
those same partners. At the

01:22:30.745 --> 01:22:36.885
table. This game with. Talking

01:22:36.951 --> 01:22:38.553
is really around please. With a

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:39.788
talk about in terms a fun you

01:22:39.854 --> 01:22:42.257
identified this is an in

01:22:42.324 --> 01:22:43.825
regional how thing original

01:22:43.892 --> 01:22:46.094
almost approach I still

01:22:46.161 --> 01:22:48.396
understand what if game ticker

01:22:48.463 --> 01:22:49.931
so within the region so the

01:22:49.998 --> 01:22:52.000
regional administrator is going

01:22:52.067 --> 01:22:54.869
to be working with all those

01:22:54.936 --> 01:22:59.507
local. He'd so not all of thing

01:22:59.574 --> 01:23:00.108
is to just at a regional level

01:23:00.175 --> 01:23:02.210
going to be year. Then

01:23:02.277 --> 01:23:04.646
distributed within the region

01:23:04.713 --> 01:23:06.981
so I don't. I'm not sure if

01:23:07.048 --> 01:23:09.684
that's making sense to you. But

01:23:09.751 --> 01:23:12.587
I'm not. You know but I think

01:23:12.654 --> 01:23:14.422
of mental illness yeah sure

01:23:14.489 --> 01:23:21.329
this is from. Just a. It is a

01:23:21.396 --> 01:23:24.065
model that I guess the you're

01:23:24.132 --> 01:23:24.632
you're basing this. Is it's

01:23:24.699 --> 01:23:27.635
been done day it is. Some might

01:23:27.702 --> 01:23:30.739
not was developed regional

01:23:30.805 --> 01:23:34.342
approach. I in no really I mean

01:23:34.409 --> 01:23:36.111
part of the mà the my the in

01:23:36.177 --> 01:23:36.745
general and what LA has done

01:23:36.811 --> 01:23:37.645
with their will have subsidy

01:23:37.712 --> 01:23:38.880
was definite top of mind the

01:23:38.947 --> 01:23:42.317
nation of many of uses here so

01:23:42.384 --> 01:23:45.887
in that the model but speak. To

01:23:45.954 --> 01:23:47.922
no any other state has the

01:23:47.989 --> 01:23:51.993
scale and scope. One that we do

01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:53.995
or the G. size we do in order.

01:23:54.062 --> 01:23:54.629
Need to address it and the same

01:23:54.696 --> 01:23:55.530
where we the reader are useful

01:23:55.597 --> 01:23:56.164
in into one that question the

01:23:56.231 --> 01:23:58.099
in. Of how the fund flows nay

01:23:58.166 --> 01:24:00.101
it lot of it to the C. season

01:24:00.168 --> 01:24:01.970
the counties so in terms and

01:24:02.036 --> 01:24:04.639
city's so then with with the

01:24:04.706 --> 01:24:06.207
regional manager then

01:24:06.274 --> 01:24:07.809
distribute so with this disease

01:24:07.876 --> 01:24:09.944
apply to the regional- in. And

01:24:10.011 --> 01:24:12.447
that. It is a full. Of flow

01:24:12.514 --> 01:24:15.116
that with the money how the

01:24:15.183 --> 01:24:16.785
research flow now a this for.

01:24:16.851 --> 01:24:18.653
Was a was in place so in the

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:21.189
immediate distribution of funds

01:24:21.256 --> 01:24:21.756
would be for the department.

01:24:21.823 --> 01:24:23.358
Digital administrators but each

01:24:23.425 --> 01:24:26.261
regional administrator would be

01:24:26.327 --> 01:24:27.929
planning locally for how they

01:24:27.996 --> 01:24:29.831
intended to then use the funds

01:24:29.898 --> 01:24:32.333
so they may be going to look.

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:32.967
For missing maybe going to non

01:24:33.034 --> 01:24:36.104
profits they- they will go. To

01:24:36.171 --> 01:24:36.638
demonstrate to that re. A

01:24:36.704 --> 01:24:37.238
straighter that they are able

01:24:37.305 --> 01:24:38.239
to. This that are expected

01:24:38.306 --> 01:24:40.141
within the plan that that

01:24:40.208 --> 01:24:40.742
region straighter with their

01:24:40.809 --> 01:24:43.111
partners has identified as

01:24:43.178 --> 01:24:45.647
necessary for the region. So

01:24:45.713 --> 01:24:47.782
for example the biggest at home

01:24:47.849 --> 01:24:48.383
center would no longer apply.

01:24:48.450 --> 01:24:51.786
Do you see. What apply to.

01:24:51.853 --> 01:24:52.353
Share for this specific of

01:24:52.420 --> 01:25:05.733
funds. Thank you. So is. Was

01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:06.334
was there re why this. Amount

01:25:06.401 --> 01:25:08.036
to see a seems like a fair.

01:25:08.102 --> 01:25:09.704
Narrow issue you. Trying to

01:25:09.771 --> 01:25:11.606
solve but yet you're asking for

01:25:11.673 --> 01:25:12.240
seven hundred and fifty million

01:25:12.307 --> 01:25:14.209
dollars to. Work on it. I'm not

01:25:14.275 --> 01:25:15.777
sure I know what the narrow

01:25:15.844 --> 01:25:17.545
issue is what we're trying to-

01:25:17.612 --> 01:25:19.547
deal with is the affordability

01:25:19.614 --> 01:25:19.981
crisis and St based

01:25:20.048 --> 01:25:22.016
homelessness so what we're-

01:25:22.083 --> 01:25:23.918
talking about is affordable

01:25:23.985 --> 01:25:24.552
housing developments. Out until

01:25:24.619 --> 01:25:27.856
subsidies tendencies. Sir is-

01:25:27.922 --> 01:25:28.423
and I think I've heard the

01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:30.058
question raised several times

01:25:30.124 --> 01:25:32.160
by others as to whether or not

01:25:32.227 --> 01:25:33.761
this is enough. Money given

01:25:33.828 --> 01:25:38.333
what word. I mean for of that

01:25:38.399 --> 01:25:40.301
issue yes but you do. You

01:25:40.368 --> 01:25:40.902
didn't ask for money for a of

01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:43.137
your a programs in terms of our

01:25:43.204 --> 01:25:43.972
other things which are in

01:25:44.038 --> 01:25:47.642
existence. You you didn't ask

01:25:47.709 --> 01:25:48.176
for money for low income

01:25:48.243 --> 01:25:53.214
housing. Tax credits you. Two

01:25:53.281 --> 01:25:56.117
gift to give money to a name

01:25:56.184 --> 01:25:58.653
region's two unnamed

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:03.191
administrators. For name things

01:26:03.258 --> 01:26:08.263
and you would like approval for

01:26:08.329 --> 01:26:10.265
that so. Difficult I mean. It's

01:26:10.331 --> 01:26:13.801
A. B. the hard to prove dollars

01:26:13.868 --> 01:26:15.837
that room well that's a little

01:26:15.904 --> 01:26:18.039
easier to. Do that a hundred

01:26:18.106 --> 01:26:18.640
and fifty nine dollars I am

01:26:18.706 --> 01:26:22.377
your desire recess we aye aye I

01:26:22.443 --> 01:26:27.682
hear you. At okay will like

01:26:27.749 --> 01:26:31.052
we're gonna have a hearings arm

01:26:31.119 --> 01:26:37.992
go forward to a it. More push.

01:26:38.059 --> 01:26:46.267
What message of. I think our

01:26:46.334 --> 01:26:46.834
chairs serve made the point

01:26:46.901 --> 01:26:48.102
Michael me just for my purse

01:26:48.169 --> 01:26:49.904
I'm to of white approaches by

01:26:49.971 --> 01:26:51.839
the number commerce that I've

01:26:51.906 --> 01:26:52.473
with with other ledge. Who will

01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:54.175
be part of potentially this

01:26:54.242 --> 01:26:54.842
about lack of specific is that

01:26:54.909 --> 01:26:56.144
I don't think can underscored a

01:26:56.210 --> 01:26:58.346
knife and I think the channel

01:26:58.413 --> 01:27:00.114
and allow three jurisdiction

01:27:00.181 --> 01:27:00.748
around cal have been a bit with

01:27:00.815 --> 01:27:04.619
first by- what went for with

01:27:04.686 --> 01:27:06.154
heap and then switch it up for

01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:08.222
happened now switch it up for

01:27:08.289 --> 01:27:10.124
the third time. So

01:27:10.191 --> 01:27:12.393
understanding why we keeps it

01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:14.963
up. Understanding where the

01:27:15.029 --> 01:27:15.563
accountability is going to be.

01:27:15.630 --> 01:27:17.298
Calm I do think the case still

01:27:17.365 --> 01:27:18.466
needs to be made a why were

01:27:18.533 --> 01:27:19.000
creating another level of

01:27:19.067 --> 01:27:19.901
bureaucracy. Of a regional

01:27:19.968 --> 01:27:21.936
ministration when we could

01:27:22.003 --> 01:27:24.105
simply ask say for example the

01:27:24.172 --> 01:27:26.541
mayors who are here- you know

01:27:26.608 --> 01:27:29.811
are you using these monies

01:27:29.877 --> 01:27:30.378
well. As opposed to again

01:27:30.445 --> 01:27:31.579
creating another level of

01:27:31.646 --> 01:27:33.114
bureaucracy- the particular for

01:27:33.181 --> 01:27:36.551
the legislature we just don't.

01:27:36.618 --> 01:27:37.151
Certainly see what was in the

01:27:37.218 --> 01:27:37.986
outcomes were looking for our

01:27:38.052 --> 01:27:39.988
and obviously we ought even

01:27:40.054 --> 01:27:41.756
know what the geographically.

01:27:41.823 --> 01:27:44.359
Are so. Lots of questions to be

01:27:44.425 --> 01:27:44.959
answered- particularly since

01:27:45.026 --> 01:27:46.761
you're asking for early

01:27:46.828 --> 01:27:48.262
approval- which I know the LA-

01:27:48.329 --> 01:27:50.465
has counseled us not to do. So

01:27:50.531 --> 01:27:52.100
you know again from I'm in an

01:27:52.166 --> 01:27:54.402
open mind but these are all the

01:27:54.469 --> 01:27:55.003
questions that I think you're

01:27:55.069 --> 01:27:57.972
going to have to answer for. A

01:27:58.039 --> 01:27:58.506
hundred twenty Boston and

01:27:58.573 --> 01:28:00.041
obviously the only for

01:28:00.108 --> 01:28:00.642
represented here today. Thank

01:28:00.708 --> 01:28:02.477
you I would also not which are

01:28:02.543 --> 01:28:04.579
meant to burn off with I do

01:28:04.646 --> 01:28:05.146
really appreciate the fact

01:28:05.213 --> 01:28:08.049
that- even though wasn't

01:28:08.116 --> 01:28:10.284
completely fleshed out the

01:28:10.351 --> 01:28:10.852
ministration bringing this

01:28:10.918 --> 01:28:12.353
forward this proposal forward

01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:13.888
and in January rather than in

01:28:13.955 --> 01:28:15.923
may- I know oftentimes we could

01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:17.825
have seen this in. The end and

01:28:17.892 --> 01:28:19.794
having a much more difficult

01:28:19.861 --> 01:28:20.361
conversations I really do.

01:28:20.428 --> 01:28:22.096
Appreciate that I think what

01:28:22.163 --> 01:28:23.898
what we are looking for is just

01:28:23.965 --> 01:28:28.002
greater. Understanding for. The

01:28:28.069 --> 01:28:30.371
problem the specific issue your

01:28:30.438 --> 01:28:32.206
trying to solve we have a

01:28:32.273 --> 01:28:34.075
number of existing programs

01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:36.377
that we will. Find in to solve

01:28:36.444 --> 01:28:37.011
the greater issue that we all

01:28:37.078 --> 01:28:39.881
agree is. The issue at hand-

01:28:39.947 --> 01:28:42.150
but wanted to get clarity as to

01:28:42.216 --> 01:28:46.020
specifically. What is. The

01:28:46.087 --> 01:28:49.857
problem. Or trying to solve it

01:28:49.924 --> 01:28:51.959
also a if you want to

01:28:52.026 --> 01:28:54.128
illuminate where there's been

01:28:54.195 --> 01:28:56.197
shortcomings in the current

01:28:56.264 --> 01:28:58.299
scheme that's fine as to what

01:28:58.366 --> 01:29:00.068
the departure but- critical.

01:29:00.134 --> 01:29:10.178
You know. What what. Thickly to

01:29:10.244 --> 01:29:14.348
why were. What would you asking

01:29:14.415 --> 01:29:16.451
us for. You know. As as to give

01:29:16.517 --> 01:29:17.085
you a seven hundred and- fifty

01:29:17.151 --> 01:29:18.186
dollar. Check with not a lot of.

01:29:18.252 --> 01:29:24.158
Our is. So thank you we are be

01:29:24.225 --> 01:29:27.829
going on to our next panel we-

01:29:27.895 --> 01:29:33.301
very very happy to. Have number

01:29:33.367 --> 01:29:36.604
of may as well as Smith in the

01:29:36.671 --> 01:29:38.606
C. of Angeles county of say

01:29:38.673 --> 01:29:40.708
just as we as our W. six for

01:29:40.775 --> 01:29:44.345
but just to it just I all the-

01:29:44.412 --> 01:29:46.247
Hanalei. To come up by mall.

01:29:46.314 --> 01:29:48.316
Sense that really appreciate

01:29:48.382 --> 01:29:50.051
mayor Liccardo Merrit show for

01:29:50.118 --> 01:29:52.320
being here center their time so

01:29:52.386 --> 01:29:54.455
if we could maybe have them go

01:29:54.522 --> 01:29:56.224
first of questions directed at

01:29:56.290 --> 01:29:58.392
them first so that they could

01:29:58.459 --> 01:30:00.628
leave with. I would appreciate

01:30:00.695 --> 01:30:21.415
that.

01:30:56.450 --> 01:31:00.955
The bill the car. And I

01:31:01.022 --> 01:31:03.057
also and the bay area's only

01:31:03.124 --> 01:31:05.526
representative on the

01:31:05.593 --> 01:31:08.496
governor's council of regional

01:31:08.563 --> 01:31:12.633
homeless and risers Bob I

01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:14.468
wanted to respond to the

01:31:14.535 --> 01:31:15.069
specific questions I received

01:31:15.136 --> 01:31:16.304
in the time allotment you gave

01:31:16.370 --> 01:31:17.805
me which is quite short but I

01:31:17.872 --> 01:31:18.940
do hope you asked me some

01:31:19.006 --> 01:31:19.473
robust questions because I

01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:22.143
would enjoy the opportunity. To

01:31:22.210 --> 01:31:23.878
dialogue with you. I'm last

01:31:23.945 --> 01:31:26.113
what do I believe are the

01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:27.882
causes of homelessness- I would

01:31:27.949 --> 01:31:31.686
say first lanes in our mental

01:31:31.752 --> 01:31:33.788
health and drug addiction

01:31:33.855 --> 01:31:36.290
treatment systems seconds a

01:31:36.357 --> 01:31:39.927
shortage of housing. Third

01:31:39.994 --> 01:31:41.996
income inequality and fourth

01:31:42.063 --> 01:31:44.065
and most importantly because I

01:31:44.131 --> 01:31:46.267
think that for example I've not

01:31:46.334 --> 01:31:48.135
heard it mentioned yet this

01:31:48.202 --> 01:31:49.871
morning unless I missed it-

01:31:49.937 --> 01:31:52.173
systemic an institutionalized

01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:55.843
racism and I am glad that

01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:58.012
Margot c shell is on your

01:31:58.079 --> 01:31:59.814
agenda today because she can

01:31:59.881 --> 01:32:02.149
articulate it far better than I

01:32:02.216 --> 01:32:04.018
can. I also asked how have we

01:32:04.085 --> 01:32:05.987
spent our state money are keep

01:32:06.053 --> 01:32:09.857
and are happy. And in in a nut

01:32:09.924 --> 01:32:14.528
shell two years ago when we-

01:32:14.595 --> 01:32:17.498
came to Sacramento to ask for

01:32:17.565 --> 01:32:22.069
direct funding cities to

01:32:22.136 --> 01:32:26.507
address homelessness. Oakland

01:32:26.574 --> 01:32:27.208
had roughly four thousand.

01:32:27.275 --> 01:32:30.011
Homeless visuals in our city

01:32:30.077 --> 01:32:33.481
and a shelter house city of.

01:32:33.547 --> 01:32:34.048
Eight hundred and forty nine

01:32:34.115 --> 01:32:36.484
beds. And so while this is one

01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:38.386
time money- I will tell you

01:32:38.452 --> 01:32:43.424
that I have spent most of my

01:32:43.491 --> 01:32:43.958
keep and happy dollars on

01:32:44.025 --> 01:32:45.559
expanding my shelter city. So

01:32:45.626 --> 01:32:49.764
in year been able to double our

01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:53.567
shelter it is just completely

01:32:53.634 --> 01:32:56.637
unacceptable allow human beings

01:32:56.704 --> 01:32:58.606
to sleep on our streets. In the

01:32:58.673 --> 01:32:59.874
wealthiest region in the

01:32:59.941 --> 01:33:00.675
wealthiest state in the

01:33:00.741 --> 01:33:04.412
wealthiest be in the world. I'm

01:33:04.478 --> 01:33:06.580
I want say that we I think

01:33:06.647 --> 01:33:08.049
share the state's perspective

01:33:08.115 --> 01:33:10.217
that measure of success is not

01:33:10.284 --> 01:33:12.620
shelter and I've been a very

01:33:12.687 --> 01:33:14.322
outspoken advocate for the

01:33:14.388 --> 01:33:18.259
mandate to end homelessness and

01:33:18.326 --> 01:33:18.859
in way explaining why I think

01:33:18.926 --> 01:33:22.964
it is far superior to a right

01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:24.966
to shelter. But the reason that

01:33:25.032 --> 01:33:26.167
I have spent my half and keep

01:33:26.233 --> 01:33:28.569
monies primarily on expanding

01:33:28.636 --> 01:33:32.073
our shop- is because I have

01:33:32.139 --> 01:33:34.141
other sources of funding. For

01:33:34.208 --> 01:33:38.012
capital. I this is the voters

01:33:38.079 --> 01:33:40.848
of Oakland the voters of

01:33:40.915 --> 01:33:43.284
Alameda county have passed

01:33:43.351 --> 01:33:43.918
their own local bond issues for

01:33:43.985 --> 01:33:47.088
affordable housing. I've gone

01:33:47.154 --> 01:33:49.256
out and hustle. My

01:33:49.323 --> 01:33:50.591
philanthropic community. And if

01:33:50.658 --> 01:33:52.526
up with a twelve million

01:33:52.593 --> 01:33:54.662
dollars fund to prevent people

01:33:54.729 --> 01:33:56.430
from falling into homelessness

01:33:56.497 --> 01:34:00.301
eight high hi. Standard of

01:34:00.368 --> 01:34:02.770
success for us- Clint what I

01:34:02.837 --> 01:34:05.406
have lacked is operational

01:34:05.473 --> 01:34:09.343
funds- I do want you to know

01:34:09.410 --> 01:34:11.612
that. The vast majority of the

01:34:11.679 --> 01:34:13.114
new beds that we have created

01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:14.548
an Oakland do come with exit

01:34:14.615 --> 01:34:19.053
resources at Ste again our goal

01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:19.687
is not just to shelter people

01:34:19.754 --> 01:34:20.821
it is to move them from

01:34:20.888 --> 01:34:23.090
homeless to house. We have used

01:34:23.157 --> 01:34:25.760
our heat and hot monies to

01:34:25.826 --> 01:34:29.663
create safe RV parking up for

01:34:29.730 --> 01:34:34.702
it the 45% of our on shelter

01:34:34.769 --> 01:34:37.138
copulation that resides in RV's

01:34:37.204 --> 01:34:39.173
or cars can I and number again

01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:41.342
forty five percent. Of our on

01:34:41.409 --> 01:34:44.412
sheltered population is in cars

01:34:44.478 --> 01:34:46.313
an Arby's. Are we have used it

01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:48.716
to create three hundred twenty

01:34:48.783 --> 01:34:49.884
two beds in our innovative.

01:34:49.950 --> 01:34:52.353
Community mock. I'm a model

01:34:52.420 --> 01:34:56.190
that costs. Sir Jeff the cut

01:34:56.257 --> 01:34:56.857
brought costs refer half of the

01:34:56.924 --> 01:34:59.160
Butte. Navigate in Oakland we

01:34:59.226 --> 01:35:00.861
don't have the same money that

01:35:00.928 --> 01:35:02.329
San Francisco has we have to be

01:35:02.396 --> 01:35:04.665
creative. Two hundred twenty

01:35:04.732 --> 01:35:06.967
three beds in our innovative

01:35:07.034 --> 01:35:09.870
cabin communities that not only

01:35:09.937 --> 01:35:13.040
allow people to go to bed at

01:35:13.107 --> 01:35:15.376
night behind a locked door with

01:35:15.443 --> 01:35:16.911
their partners their pets and

01:35:16.977 --> 01:35:17.378
their possessions. But

01:35:17.445 --> 01:35:18.979
something that tradition. Does

01:35:19.046 --> 01:35:21.048
not offer and that is privacy.

01:35:21.115 --> 01:35:24.085
That is why we have had high

01:35:24.151 --> 01:35:24.618
demand and high acceptance

01:35:24.685 --> 01:35:28.589
rates for this form of shelter

01:35:28.656 --> 01:35:31.826
far higher interest. Than

01:35:31.892 --> 01:35:33.260
willing. To our more

01:35:33.327 --> 01:35:37.898
traditional congregate shelters.

01:35:37.965 --> 01:35:38.499
We're happy for the same rates

01:35:38.566 --> 01:35:44.572
up on. Exits. To traditional so

01:35:44.638 --> 01:35:46.874
although as high as a rap

01:35:46.941 --> 01:35:51.078
housing so. Burke what is and-

01:35:51.145 --> 01:35:53.948
shelter leader the winter to a

01:35:54.014 --> 01:35:57.852
year round shelter- as well as

01:35:57.918 --> 01:36:00.521
to add new Bextor uses shelter

01:36:00.588 --> 01:36:01.088
and we are going to in one

01:36:01.155 --> 01:36:04.892
month the opening. Families so

01:36:04.959 --> 01:36:09.130
we have your money. Twenty and

01:36:09.196 --> 01:36:12.433
wrap it this up again I to

01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:14.401
emphasize the real we have

01:36:14.468 --> 01:36:14.969
spent your money on all the

01:36:15.035 --> 01:36:18.005
very thing that the new per.

01:36:18.072 --> 01:36:20.141
And this his because we've a to

01:36:20.207 --> 01:36:22.276
find other so. For those things

01:36:22.343 --> 01:36:24.078
not because we don't value them

01:36:24.145 --> 01:36:26.413
and that's another reason that

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:27.982
we encourage you to preserve

01:36:28.048 --> 01:36:30.317
some local flexibility- impact

01:36:30.384 --> 01:36:32.720
you know again we share the

01:36:32.786 --> 01:36:36.023
values that are behind the

01:36:36.090 --> 01:36:36.590
governor's proposal for the

01:36:36.657 --> 01:36:38.192
seven hundred and fifty million

01:36:38.259 --> 01:36:40.427
dollar fund but we would argue

01:36:40.494 --> 01:36:45.065
right now shelter is not an

01:36:45.132 --> 01:36:48.569
allowable use of the new fund.

01:36:48.636 --> 01:36:52.973
I and we would argue he like

01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:54.675
ours is meeting the service

01:36:54.742 --> 01:36:58.212
rate house. Ste in permanent

01:36:58.279 --> 01:36:59.980
part of housing in a- from

01:37:00.047 --> 01:37:02.149
homeless to how in prevent

01:37:02.216 --> 01:37:04.552
homelessness. We should be

01:37:04.618 --> 01:37:06.487
allowed to at least maintain

01:37:06.554 --> 01:37:08.689
the systems that we have put up

01:37:08.756 --> 01:37:10.357
with your past funds of an

01:37:10.424 --> 01:37:12.393
adult not allow those to fall

01:37:12.459 --> 01:37:14.195
apart and I think the

01:37:14.261 --> 01:37:16.564
governor's office would agree

01:37:16.630 --> 01:37:18.299
you've also asked whether these

01:37:18.365 --> 01:37:20.868
funds have inspired

01:37:20.935 --> 01:37:22.903
collaboration. And I would say

01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:24.939
that it has inspired some city

01:37:25.005 --> 01:37:28.475
to city collaboration- some of

01:37:28.542 --> 01:37:29.076
our interventions in Oakland

01:37:29.143 --> 01:37:30.511
have been in partnership with

01:37:30.578 --> 01:37:32.213
the cities of Berkeley and of

01:37:32.279 --> 01:37:36.450
Emeryville. In some limited.

01:37:36.517 --> 01:37:38.419
With the county but I have to

01:37:38.485 --> 01:37:40.387
be honest not as much as I

01:37:40.454 --> 01:37:44.058
would have hoped- I do again

01:37:44.124 --> 01:37:46.560
agree with the governor's. And

01:37:46.627 --> 01:37:51.999
US secretary galleys. I believe

01:37:52.066 --> 01:37:52.600
that we need more regional

01:37:52.666 --> 01:37:56.170
collaboration and coordination-

01:37:56.237 --> 01:37:58.439
but I regret to say I do not

01:37:58.505 --> 01:37:59.006
believe the creation of a

01:37:59.073 --> 01:38:01.675
regional administrator would

01:38:01.742 --> 01:38:05.579
accomplish that at least not in

01:38:05.646 --> 01:38:07.481
the way it's currently proposed

01:38:07.548 --> 01:38:08.916
on the time line that is in

01:38:08.983 --> 01:38:12.820
front of us and with the use of

01:38:12.886 --> 01:38:13.454
one time funds. Were to about a

01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:15.122
permanent ongoing source of

01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:15.656
funding that would be an

01:38:15.723 --> 01:38:19.593
entirely different com station

01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:20.127
but because that is not

01:38:20.194 --> 01:38:23.897
currently on the table I do not

01:38:23.964 --> 01:38:25.532
think it is worth the trip and

01:38:25.599 --> 01:38:30.337
it will be very. To all

01:38:30.404 --> 01:38:31.639
difference raiders if you're

01:38:31.705 --> 01:38:35.576
talking about only one time on.

01:38:35.643 --> 01:38:39.413
As far as the next step but I

01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:40.047
would like to see. Yes to come

01:38:40.114 --> 01:38:41.782
men. Of honor and secretary

01:38:41.849 --> 01:38:44.518
galley for continual. Pushing

01:38:44.585 --> 01:38:46.654
that our measure of success is

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:50.624
not shelter it is moving people

01:38:50.691 --> 01:38:51.925
from homeless to house and it

01:38:51.992 --> 01:38:55.829
is preventing people from ever

01:38:55.896 --> 01:38:56.797
experiencing the trauma

01:38:56.864 --> 01:39:00.701
homelessness to begin with or

01:39:00.768 --> 01:39:03.904
even of housing in security so.

01:39:03.971 --> 01:39:05.806
Many in the area in part parks

01:39:05.873 --> 01:39:08.676
and sing. I'm aye no one has

01:39:08.742 --> 01:39:10.711
raised the R. word today and

01:39:10.778 --> 01:39:15.549
that is redevelopment- when I

01:39:15.616 --> 01:39:17.885
talk about you know these

01:39:17.951 --> 01:39:21.822
valiant efforts at the local

01:39:21.889 --> 01:39:23.757
level of locally approved.

01:39:23.824 --> 01:39:25.592
Bonds for. Hey in comparison to

01:39:25.659 --> 01:39:29.797
the redeveloped. From us. I

01:39:29.863 --> 01:39:35.803
also want to give a passionate

01:39:35.869 --> 01:39:38.072
support for a legal mandate to

01:39:38.138 --> 01:39:40.407
and homelessness- I know that

01:39:40.474 --> 01:39:41.942
we are continuing to clarify

01:39:42.009 --> 01:39:47.581
what that means I want to say

01:39:47.648 --> 01:39:50.884
in response to- mayor breeds

01:39:50.951 --> 01:39:51.518
bands we are not intending to

01:39:51.585 --> 01:39:53.821
give city or county. On man

01:39:53.887 --> 01:39:57.024
it's out new things this and

01:39:57.091 --> 01:39:58.926
that I know that I will be part

01:39:58.992 --> 01:40:02.930
of a happy chorus that says one

01:40:02.996 --> 01:40:03.564
time funding homelessness will

01:40:03.630 --> 01:40:07.434
not work we need an ongoing

01:40:07.501 --> 01:40:09.636
permanent source if we are

01:40:09.703 --> 01:40:11.572
really serious about ending

01:40:11.638 --> 01:40:13.841
this travesty so those are my

01:40:13.907 --> 01:40:16.610
comments I am very happy to

01:40:16.677 --> 01:40:18.912
take your questions. But we'll

01:40:18.979 --> 01:40:20.381
go with the car they will have

01:40:20.447 --> 01:40:31.024
quite from both. From great

01:40:31.091 --> 01:40:34.261
partners in this at.

01:40:34.328 --> 01:40:35.996
Homelessness in our region how

01:40:36.063 --> 01:40:36.630
to work with mayor Libby Schaaf

01:40:36.697 --> 01:40:43.036
Maryland in. All up to grateful

01:40:43.103 --> 01:40:46.807
work of your committee. And

01:40:46.874 --> 01:40:48.375
what is really emerged. I just

01:40:48.442 --> 01:40:48.942
and from the governor of the

01:40:49.009 --> 01:40:53.714
lack of years where we can now

01:40:53.781 --> 01:40:54.314
one in three point one billion

01:40:54.381 --> 01:40:57.451
dollars in. Funding to tackle

01:40:57.518 --> 01:40:59.887
homelessness through programs

01:40:59.953 --> 01:41:02.289
like at a place like home and

01:41:02.356 --> 01:41:06.160
he perhaps course. I really do

01:41:06.226 --> 01:41:06.693
want to emphasize I think

01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:08.562
governor Newsome for his

01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:09.163
leadership in making historic

01:41:09.229 --> 01:41:10.831
in. About homeless lap. Postal

01:41:10.898 --> 01:41:16.937
this year and if approach in

01:41:17.004 --> 01:41:17.571
working with critically with

01:41:17.638 --> 01:41:21.475
the mayors the thirty largest

01:41:21.542 --> 01:41:23.444
cities. Although that coalition

01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:26.113
this year I will not be

01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:26.780
speaking on behalf of that cold

01:41:26.847 --> 01:41:30.150
will be speaking together and

01:41:30.217 --> 01:41:30.684
Sacramento just weeks I'm

01:41:30.751 --> 01:41:31.285
guessing you'll hear from us

01:41:31.351 --> 01:41:34.488
then I just like to confinement

01:41:34.555 --> 01:41:35.088
marks to my own perspectives

01:41:35.155 --> 01:41:39.126
and first what you consider the

01:41:39.193 --> 01:41:40.127
city of San Jose a very active

01:41:40.194 --> 01:41:42.496
in when partner- in this battle

01:41:42.563 --> 01:41:47.634
we all face- prior the state's

01:41:47.701 --> 01:41:48.235
elimination of redevelopment

01:41:48.302 --> 01:41:49.336
agencies we spent forty million

01:41:49.403 --> 01:41:51.772
dollars a year to be more

01:41:51.839 --> 01:41:52.339
affordable housing than the

01:41:52.406 --> 01:41:54.007
other city over that. Time we-

01:41:54.074 --> 01:41:54.608
all the way the California's

01:41:54.675 --> 01:41:57.911
Court enable us to enact.

01:41:57.978 --> 01:42:00.280
Inclusionary housing eight and

01:42:00.347 --> 01:42:00.881
to protect that the right of

01:42:00.948 --> 01:42:05.652
others. To do the same. I would

01:42:05.719 --> 01:42:06.987
provide a laboratory first

01:42:07.054 --> 01:42:08.755
state pilot projects including

01:42:08.822 --> 01:42:09.823
the leasing Caltrans land. For

01:42:09.890 --> 01:42:11.859
action decisional house for the

01:42:11.925 --> 01:42:14.728
homeless including rapid bill

01:42:14.795 --> 01:42:17.064
tiny home communities. And

01:42:17.130 --> 01:42:19.199
since twenty seventeen we've of

01:42:19.266 --> 01:42:19.666
fortune every strong

01:42:19.733 --> 01:42:20.734
relationship with our county-

01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:23.036
to leverage in dollar county

01:42:23.103 --> 01:42:24.505
bond. On with. The millions of

01:42:24.571 --> 01:42:26.173
dollars a city for bloom

01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:27.875
dollars to complete to support

01:42:27.941 --> 01:42:30.511
of housing developments- along

01:42:30.577 --> 01:42:33.146
with. Since more units are

01:42:33.213 --> 01:42:33.747
under construction or in the

01:42:33.814 --> 01:42:35.816
pipeline and seventeen other

01:42:35.883 --> 01:42:39.019
projects- and- a week. Voters

01:42:39.086 --> 01:42:41.855
will keep a measure to. Seventy

01:42:41.922 --> 01:42:43.624
million dollars annually to

01:42:43.690 --> 01:42:44.224
combat homelessness and build

01:42:44.291 --> 01:42:50.531
affordable housing. I am world

01:42:50.597 --> 01:42:51.164
posing this year. And it's free

01:42:51.231 --> 01:42:54.401
on all commercial about. Of

01:42:54.468 --> 01:42:55.002
course none of this is nearly

01:42:55.068 --> 01:42:55.602
enough any our community since

01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:56.203
not even close out while we're

01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:56.770
building the permanent

01:42:56.837 --> 01:42:57.404
supportive housing and yes will

01:42:57.471 --> 01:42:59.840
need much much more of it. More

01:42:59.907 --> 01:43:02.276
flexible funding. From diesel.

01:43:02.342 --> 01:43:02.809
For folks still out on the

01:43:02.876 --> 01:43:04.177
street. And prior to the city's

01:43:04.244 --> 01:43:07.514
receipt of hip funds the city

01:43:07.581 --> 01:43:09.349
dedicated fifteen point six

01:43:09.416 --> 01:43:10.651
million dollars a year to

01:43:10.717 --> 01:43:12.653
homelessness response programs

01:43:12.719 --> 01:43:13.287
and he by basically came at a

01:43:13.353 --> 01:43:15.222
critical moment and we're able

01:43:15.289 --> 01:43:17.791
to. Leverage this eleven

01:43:17.858 --> 01:43:18.425
million dollars in such kind

01:43:18.492 --> 01:43:20.460
would happen to nearly twenty

01:43:20.527 --> 01:43:22.930
four million dollars this year

01:43:22.996 --> 01:43:25.666
and where we dedicating those

01:43:25.732 --> 01:43:26.300
dollars well three general

01:43:26.366 --> 01:43:27.200
buckets first most the funding

01:43:27.267 --> 01:43:28.435
is dedicated to getting

01:43:28.502 --> 01:43:29.937
homeless individuals. St

01:43:30.003 --> 01:43:32.706
archers rental subsidies use of

01:43:32.773 --> 01:43:34.508
converted motels creative

01:43:34.575 --> 01:43:37.477
diversion strategies- youth and

01:43:37.544 --> 01:43:39.446
adult navigation centers and

01:43:39.513 --> 01:43:41.915
bridge housing- we've just

01:43:41.982 --> 01:43:43.417
completed one of those tiny

01:43:43.483 --> 01:43:43.951
home communities is being

01:43:44.017 --> 01:43:45.052
leased up in the second

01:43:45.118 --> 01:43:45.586
committees up construction

01:43:45.652 --> 01:43:49.756
second we've invested in rooms

01:43:49.823 --> 01:43:50.290
you that will reduce human

01:43:50.357 --> 01:43:52.359
misery and improve safety of

01:43:52.426 --> 01:43:54.962
homeless residents everything

01:43:55.028 --> 01:43:56.663
from say parking to overnight

01:43:56.730 --> 01:43:58.465
warming's shelters to mobile

01:43:58.532 --> 01:44:00.400
showers and bathrooms- but

01:44:00.467 --> 01:44:01.668
finally most importantly

01:44:01.735 --> 01:44:06.406
notices. In the mail shops do

01:44:06.473 --> 01:44:08.442
we're investing. And over the

01:44:08.508 --> 01:44:14.781
last two cycles- we will have

01:44:14.848 --> 01:44:15.382
invested seven million dollars

01:44:15.449 --> 01:44:19.286
combined in prevention and we

01:44:19.353 --> 01:44:19.886
got to prevention because the

01:44:19.953 --> 01:44:21.154
whole. Two three years Asian

01:44:21.221 --> 01:44:26.593
with the county. One seven

01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:28.929
thousand. We are still staying

01:44:28.996 --> 01:44:31.231
are homeless and right. It

01:44:31.298 --> 01:44:31.798
became apparent that passes

01:44:31.865 --> 01:44:35.002
we're housing people more

01:44:35.068 --> 01:44:36.403
people are getting pushed out

01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:37.504
onto the street and so we try

01:44:37.571 --> 01:44:39.473
to pilot prevention and we

01:44:39.539 --> 01:44:42.109
leverage a lot private sector

01:44:42.175 --> 01:44:42.643
money back almost fifteen

01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:44.378
million dollars. The first- for

01:44:44.444 --> 01:44:47.781
our commitment in the counties

01:44:47.848 --> 01:44:52.452
also. In for. And what we learn

01:44:52.519 --> 01:44:53.020
is this is very active for

01:44:53.086 --> 01:44:54.221
spending about. Forty three

01:44:54.287 --> 01:44:56.123
hundred. Family and what we're

01:44:56.189 --> 01:44:56.690
finding in the flexible a-

01:44:56.757 --> 01:45:00.027
since. Ninety then one AT so

01:45:00.093 --> 01:45:02.262
for that would help. Are still

01:45:02.329 --> 01:45:05.098
housed six months later. A and

01:45:05.165 --> 01:45:07.367
so it is preventing

01:45:07.434 --> 01:45:10.170
homelessness it's also very

01:45:10.237 --> 01:45:10.804
nimble because more than three

01:45:10.871 --> 01:45:12.939
quarters those families are

01:45:13.006 --> 01:45:15.409
getting assistance within

01:45:15.475 --> 01:45:17.978
seventy two hours. Up so

01:45:18.045 --> 01:45:19.312
there's certainly an important

01:45:19.379 --> 01:45:21.748
debate about the state's next

01:45:21.815 --> 01:45:22.416
steps I really appreciate your

01:45:22.482 --> 01:45:23.383
willingness to have this

01:45:23.450 --> 01:45:24.017
discussion now and I know will

01:45:24.084 --> 01:45:28.321
continue but not surprisingly I

01:45:28.388 --> 01:45:29.790
join my colleague and- feeling

01:45:29.856 --> 01:45:34.428
quite strongly that we- as many

01:45:34.494 --> 01:45:35.529
needs behind. This is basis and

01:45:35.595 --> 01:45:39.599
we need to treat it like one

01:45:39.666 --> 01:45:40.133
and I agree Sir. With my

01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:40.734
colleague from Los Angeles as

01:45:40.801 --> 01:45:46.073
well we need I'm going in del.

01:45:46.139 --> 01:45:50.644
Crisis also not surprisingly I

01:45:50.711 --> 01:45:51.178
believe that those dollars

01:45:51.244 --> 01:45:52.713
should be directed large cities

01:45:52.779 --> 01:45:59.386
seize. S. cities or I'm sorry

01:45:59.453 --> 01:46:02.889
in the were the salute are.

01:46:02.956 --> 01:46:24.344
Permanent how or housing. Then.

01:46:32.786 --> 01:46:38.558
It is critically in. In local

01:46:38.625 --> 01:46:40.827
government as well I that one

01:46:40.894 --> 01:46:43.663
complaints come in about

01:46:43.730 --> 01:46:44.264
homelessness and what's going

01:46:44.331 --> 01:46:48.969
on in communities. They won't

01:46:49.035 --> 01:46:53.306
go to the John traders. Sure

01:46:53.373 --> 01:46:57.844
San Francisco. The cast member

01:46:57.911 --> 01:47:00.747
has a leave that one alone. It

01:47:00.814 --> 01:47:02.516
is a will take on our account

01:47:02.582 --> 01:47:06.586
but he- just late into the

01:47:06.653 --> 01:47:09.389
public you know I encourage you

01:47:09.456 --> 01:47:12.159
to impose very clear metrics-

01:47:12.225 --> 01:47:14.694
there are results oriented

01:47:14.761 --> 01:47:15.595
around performance we all have

01:47:15.662 --> 01:47:18.431
HMIS data bases we should be

01:47:18.498 --> 01:47:18.999
using them and we should be

01:47:19.065 --> 01:47:20.200
using them to but scannable.

01:47:20.267 --> 01:47:25.105
Performance and so- a finally I

01:47:25.172 --> 01:47:27.774
would urge if that was the goal

01:47:27.841 --> 01:47:29.643
here is to avoid the cost us a

01:47:29.709 --> 01:47:30.744
passing through a lot of

01:47:30.811 --> 01:47:34.581
agencies get that nice or the

01:47:34.648 --> 01:47:35.415
governor reduce. Expense and I

01:47:35.482 --> 01:47:37.050
think cities would happily take

01:47:37.117 --> 01:47:40.620
on the same percent a cap on

01:47:40.687 --> 01:47:41.121
the mystery of expand.

01:47:41.188 --> 01:47:43.156
Collectively for all citizen on

01:47:43.223 --> 01:47:45.225
Providence were administering

01:47:45.292 --> 01:47:48.094
this program is really critical

01:47:48.161 --> 01:47:48.929
given the allocation of he

01:47:48.995 --> 01:47:50.697
perhaps that's already out

01:47:50.764 --> 01:47:53.200
there we've got programs in the

01:47:53.266 --> 01:47:55.202
city centers A. recall another

01:47:55.268 --> 01:47:58.738
fourteen million dollars

01:47:58.805 --> 01:47:59.406
annually just to maintain those.

01:47:59.472 --> 01:48:01.007
The rug out will not. The

01:48:01.074 --> 01:48:02.876
alignment and we need to for.

01:48:02.943 --> 01:48:04.911
We stand to do more with you

01:48:04.978 --> 01:48:05.478
and look forward to working

01:48:05.545 --> 01:48:09.883
with you to do more. Thank is

01:48:09.950 --> 01:48:12.452
come back to my colleagues for

01:48:12.519 --> 01:48:16.923
questions. Mr Shipp. Let me

01:48:16.990 --> 01:48:18.825
first start by the two mayors

01:48:18.892 --> 01:48:21.828
along with mayor breed- I can't.

01:48:21.895 --> 01:48:25.599
A who are who are. Fighting at

01:48:25.665 --> 01:48:28.468
the forefront of a job this

01:48:28.535 --> 01:48:30.837
crisis appreciate. Striving

01:48:30.904 --> 01:48:33.573
mightily- and also appreciate

01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:35.675
just how under resource to our-

01:48:35.742 --> 01:48:37.444
a couple quick points first of

01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:37.844
all with regard to

01:48:37.911 --> 01:48:40.313
redevelopment I think you know.

01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:40.947
Two point oh bill so Jim bell

01:48:41.014 --> 01:48:44.117
had- carried version of it. Our

01:48:44.184 --> 01:48:45.518
governor- had step we

01:48:45.585 --> 01:48:46.853
understand his perspective

01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:47.420
that- that relying on the

01:48:47.487 --> 01:48:48.688
general fund for that was not a

01:48:48.755 --> 01:48:50.490
path he was what to do- and so

01:48:50.557 --> 01:48:52.659
to some degree were a bit stuck

01:48:52.726 --> 01:48:54.394
in this conversation- very much

01:48:54.461 --> 01:48:56.963
appreciate- that you support

01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:59.099
the idea of a permanent source

01:48:59.165 --> 01:49:00.901
of funding for homelessness and

01:49:00.967 --> 01:49:02.269
specifically- your support

01:49:02.335 --> 01:49:02.869
also. Our proposal to reform

01:49:02.936 --> 01:49:05.205
the mortgage interest

01:49:05.272 --> 01:49:07.674
deduction. Which will. To about

01:49:07.741 --> 01:49:09.943
a half a billion dollars when

01:49:10.010 --> 01:49:13.113
we know the need is much larger

01:49:13.179 --> 01:49:14.047
than that will take it though.

01:49:14.114 --> 01:49:17.517
The work with you on that.

01:49:17.584 --> 01:49:19.686
Questions have you done a needs

01:49:19.753 --> 01:49:21.955
assessment in your respective

01:49:22.022 --> 01:49:22.589
cities up. How much would it

01:49:22.656 --> 01:49:24.758
cost Oakland or San Jose. To

01:49:24.824 --> 01:49:27.093
and homelessness and I. Senate

01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:33.833
because I think it's a state

01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:34.434
really assistance and I think

01:49:34.501 --> 01:49:35.035
if we don't start with the end

01:49:35.101 --> 01:49:37.237
in mind. What what it costs to

01:49:37.304 --> 01:49:39.906
an homelessness how much will.

01:49:39.973 --> 01:49:41.574
Be it's hard for us to have the

01:49:41.641 --> 01:49:42.676
early come Xin of how how. How

01:49:42.742 --> 01:49:43.209
large should we consider

01:49:43.276 --> 01:49:44.511
investing. I've heard

01:49:44.577 --> 01:49:47.013
statistics anyway for example.

01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:48.148
To house every homeless person

01:49:48.214 --> 01:49:50.116
in the state and provides part

01:49:50.183 --> 01:49:50.717
of housing might cost to say

01:49:50.784 --> 01:49:51.318
twenty five billion dollars.

01:49:51.384 --> 01:49:52.485
That's just a back of the

01:49:52.552 --> 01:49:54.387
envelope commerce calculation

01:49:54.454 --> 01:49:54.955
someone is provided curious

01:49:55.021 --> 01:49:56.256
from your standpoint whether.

01:49:56.323 --> 01:49:58.391
You run those numbers for your

01:49:58.458 --> 01:49:58.959
cities. Note that I'm not

01:49:59.025 --> 01:50:00.894
looking at my notes I know

01:50:00.961 --> 01:50:04.331
this. By heart- our plan our

01:50:04.397 --> 01:50:06.099
path plan that we have

01:50:06.166 --> 01:50:08.601
conducted a very deep analysis

01:50:08.668 --> 01:50:10.837
using systems modeling on our

01:50:10.904 --> 01:50:13.974
existing homeless population.

01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:15.508
We estimate that the city of

01:50:15.575 --> 01:50:18.278
Oakland need annually on an

01:50:18.345 --> 01:50:20.447
ongoing basis a hundred and

01:50:20.513 --> 01:50:21.881
twenty three million dollars in

01:50:21.948 --> 01:50:24.017
operating funds. And then a

01:50:24.084 --> 01:50:26.519
capital experts. Roughly every

01:50:26.586 --> 01:50:27.620
five you of about two hundred

01:50:27.687 --> 01:50:30.156
and twenty million dollars.

01:50:30.223 --> 01:50:32.726
What we are spending right now-

01:50:32.792 --> 01:50:33.326
and I can't I can't pull out

01:50:33.393 --> 01:50:34.594
the state capitol number for

01:50:34.661 --> 01:50:37.630
you but I can tell you

01:50:37.697 --> 01:50:39.899
operationally worst being

01:50:39.966 --> 01:50:40.467
thirty two million dollars a

01:50:40.533 --> 01:50:45.538
year. And roughly half of that

01:50:45.605 --> 01:50:50.343
is time money. That spending on

01:50:50.410 --> 01:50:52.245
operation and I am I am very

01:50:52.312 --> 01:50:54.214
fiscally responsible and very

01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:54.848
proud that Oakland just got its

01:50:54.914 --> 01:50:56.249
highest rating in its history

01:50:56.316 --> 01:50:58.385
last week. I is it that you're

01:50:58.451 --> 01:51:00.453
response financially I think it

01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:03.256
is. Necessary moral. But we've

01:51:03.323 --> 01:51:05.625
got to fix that we are doing

01:51:05.692 --> 01:51:09.229
this right now because we

01:51:09.295 --> 01:51:09.829
believe that we as a society

01:51:09.896 --> 01:51:11.197
going. Eight a permanent

01:51:11.264 --> 01:51:14.601
ongoing funding source to end

01:51:14.667 --> 01:51:15.235
homelessness I believe that the

01:51:15.301 --> 01:51:16.970
political will is there I

01:51:17.037 --> 01:51:18.405
believe that the public will is

01:51:18.471 --> 01:51:20.840
there I believe we will do that

01:51:20.907 --> 01:51:25.478
and so we are. Using one time

01:51:25.545 --> 01:51:26.079
funds right now for on going

01:51:26.146 --> 01:51:27.180
expenses. Because of that faith

01:51:27.247 --> 01:51:33.520
that we have. Thank you. May

01:51:33.586 --> 01:51:35.455
have is met- responses after

01:51:35.522 --> 01:51:36.890
that the hearing with regard to

01:51:36.956 --> 01:51:37.924
specific numbers that tell you

01:51:37.991 --> 01:51:40.627
Michael is that we don't need a

01:51:40.693 --> 01:51:42.962
permit on going. To combat

01:51:43.029 --> 01:51:43.563
homelessness I would make the

01:51:43.630 --> 01:51:46.633
capital investments we need I

01:51:46.699 --> 01:51:47.233
that will actually get people

01:51:47.300 --> 01:51:50.537
housed. It seems to me that

01:51:50.603 --> 01:51:52.338
given the numbers that we know

01:51:52.405 --> 01:51:54.541
are out there you know we were

01:51:54.607 --> 01:51:57.477
able to house. And seven

01:51:57.544 --> 01:51:58.078
thousand nine hundred homeless

01:51:58.144 --> 01:51:59.412
issues over a period of low

01:51:59.479 --> 01:52:01.314
more than three years. With

01:52:01.381 --> 01:52:04.918
relatively scarce resources- we

01:52:04.984 --> 01:52:06.619
think we can clearly magnified

01:52:06.686 --> 01:52:08.588
impact. With a significant

01:52:08.655 --> 01:52:10.957
basement now from the state. We

01:52:11.024 --> 01:52:12.425
are asking our residents for

01:52:12.492 --> 01:52:14.594
more- we're all asking our our

01:52:14.661 --> 01:52:17.564
taxpayers to pay more to combat

01:52:17.630 --> 01:52:18.064
this were willing to be

01:52:18.131 --> 01:52:20.767
partners. Second question we're

01:52:20.834 --> 01:52:22.836
here very consistently from-

01:52:22.902 --> 01:52:25.071
localities around the state

01:52:25.138 --> 01:52:27.740
about the need for flexibility

01:52:27.807 --> 01:52:28.408
right local flexibility- and

01:52:28.475 --> 01:52:33.947
there's a tension between sort

01:52:34.013 --> 01:52:34.447
of local flexibility and

01:52:34.514 --> 01:52:35.014
accountability when that the

01:52:35.081 --> 01:52:35.582
monies that we're going to

01:52:35.648 --> 01:52:39.686
invest actually get back to us

01:52:39.752 --> 01:52:41.855
could you tell us how should we.

01:52:41.921 --> 01:52:42.489
Please and counties accountable

01:52:42.555 --> 01:52:44.991
for the good use of. You do not

01:52:45.058 --> 01:52:46.693
want us for were not able to

01:52:46.759 --> 01:52:47.227
really prescribe for good

01:52:47.293 --> 01:52:51.698
reason how you how we think you

01:52:51.764 --> 01:52:54.100
ought to use the funds- jump in

01:52:54.167 --> 01:52:56.469
on this one I you know I think-

01:52:56.536 --> 01:52:57.070
critical that. The metric in

01:52:57.137 --> 01:53:00.907
the accountability. Based on.

01:53:00.974 --> 01:53:01.541
But are we getting people how

01:53:01.608 --> 01:53:04.577
service staying house and how

01:53:04.644 --> 01:53:05.178
many homeless are still out on

01:53:05.245 --> 01:53:09.482
the street. It seems to me that

01:53:09.549 --> 01:53:10.083
is the measure that is most

01:53:10.150 --> 01:53:12.852
important to our communities

01:53:12.919 --> 01:53:15.155
and I know that's what's most

01:53:15.221 --> 01:53:19.659
important to the state I know

01:53:19.726 --> 01:53:20.293
there are a lot of ideas about

01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:21.861
how money can be better. Be

01:53:21.928 --> 01:53:23.630
used better or worse in any

01:53:23.696 --> 01:53:26.533
given community. But I think so

01:53:26.599 --> 01:53:28.501
now. I within RCA cities their

01:53:28.568 --> 01:53:29.135
different needs depending on.

01:53:29.202 --> 01:53:31.037
Rail but yes we have in each

01:53:31.104 --> 01:53:33.239
community for example the

01:53:33.306 --> 01:53:35.508
centers A. S. had. The opiate a

01:53:35.575 --> 01:53:37.143
crisis that I think we seem to

01:53:37.210 --> 01:53:38.378
make their cities but we are

01:53:38.444 --> 01:53:40.680
today that is. A grappling with

01:53:40.747 --> 01:53:45.451
a serious addiction issue and

01:53:45.518 --> 01:53:46.019
has been the case for many

01:53:46.085 --> 01:53:48.254
years- that does Chris

01:53:48.321 --> 01:53:50.323
different set of needs in terms

01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:52.959
of but treatment. As well as

01:53:53.026 --> 01:53:56.162
intervention. I think it's

01:53:56.229 --> 01:53:57.797
important how that such. Now I

01:53:57.864 --> 01:54:02.669
just have very strict standards

01:54:02.735 --> 01:54:06.573
about the comms. But I gave it.

01:54:06.639 --> 01:54:11.477
To hold us accountable comes up.

01:54:11.544 --> 01:54:18.384
I would add to that. Because I

01:54:18.451 --> 01:54:21.955
don't have the will. Twenty

01:54:22.021 --> 01:54:22.555
three million dollars a year

01:54:22.622 --> 01:54:24.991
our what we are committed to

01:54:25.058 --> 01:54:29.262
doing is. With the limited

01:54:29.329 --> 01:54:29.862
money we have always be having

01:54:29.929 --> 01:54:32.966
ratio always best. Ensure

01:54:33.032 --> 01:54:36.769
shelter in here. So you know

01:54:36.836 --> 01:54:39.305
making sure people are doing

01:54:39.372 --> 01:54:41.274
all those things and be aware

01:54:41.341 --> 01:54:45.245
are still elected officials

01:54:45.311 --> 01:54:49.449
that find it acceptable to in

01:54:49.515 --> 01:54:50.083
public say that their solution

01:54:50.149 --> 01:54:51.784
to homelessness is shipping

01:54:51.851 --> 01:54:53.086
their homeless to other. Have

01:54:53.152 --> 01:54:58.224
about holding us accountable.

01:54:58.291 --> 01:55:00.893
To arms is you cannot have as a

01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:03.529
pure outcome at there is less.

01:55:03.596 --> 01:55:06.332
Homelessness because you don't

01:55:06.399 --> 01:55:09.636
want to incentivize. We see

01:55:09.702 --> 01:55:11.504
that that is real and you you

01:55:11.571 --> 01:55:14.340
have to protect against. One

01:55:14.407 --> 01:55:16.609
five. I know if you were on the

01:55:16.676 --> 01:55:19.679
for region home adviser and-

01:55:19.746 --> 01:55:23.049
number had proposed this idea

01:55:23.116 --> 01:55:23.616
constitutional amendment of

01:55:23.683 --> 01:55:31.624
some sort that would hold both

01:55:31.691 --> 01:55:36.796
city desire and so the attack.

01:55:36.863 --> 01:55:37.397
Want to ask you back to. Read

01:55:37.463 --> 01:55:39.499
in her purse. Weeks so I think

01:55:39.565 --> 01:55:41.834
it's fair to say that the

01:55:41.901 --> 01:55:43.536
proposal that is currently

01:55:43.603 --> 01:55:45.505
published is pretty big I in so

01:55:45.571 --> 01:55:48.708
our work right now is to put

01:55:48.775 --> 01:55:51.077
some some specificity and-

01:55:51.144 --> 01:55:54.647
employee in up come. To what

01:55:54.714 --> 01:55:59.185
this mandate is because of

01:55:59.252 --> 01:56:02.322
mayor breeds of you what at

01:56:02.388 --> 01:56:03.589
that she stated today is one

01:56:03.656 --> 01:56:05.058
that is not intended and I do

01:56:05.124 --> 01:56:07.927
not leave will become part

01:56:07.994 --> 01:56:10.129
legal mandate to and

01:56:10.196 --> 01:56:13.232
homelessness it is not what is

01:56:13.299 --> 01:56:16.936
not intention certainly as a

01:56:17.003 --> 01:56:17.470
matter. Does not intention

01:56:17.537 --> 01:56:19.038
quite is to spend money that.

01:56:19.105 --> 01:56:20.306
Cree clarity about who's a- for

01:56:20.373 --> 01:56:24.110
what right now there is no

01:56:24.177 --> 01:56:25.845
clarity there are no legal

01:56:25.912 --> 01:56:27.447
responsibilities with regard to

01:56:27.513 --> 01:56:31.017
homelessness on any level of.

01:56:31.084 --> 01:56:35.088
Second it is to again create

01:56:35.154 --> 01:56:37.290
here a clear set of results

01:56:37.357 --> 01:56:40.860
that are required and

01:56:40.927 --> 01:56:43.196
definitions what success looks

01:56:43.262 --> 01:56:47.066
like. We also Sir- looking

01:56:47.133 --> 01:56:47.700
clear that this mandate include

01:56:47.767 --> 01:56:51.270
parents as well. For

01:56:51.337 --> 01:56:53.005
jurisdictions that we want to

01:56:53.072 --> 01:56:55.241
be kind of certified as- back

01:56:55.308 --> 01:56:58.611
to scene the best practices in

01:56:58.678 --> 01:57:04.417
reducing homelessness so those

01:57:04.484 --> 01:57:07.186
are some pieces of the puzzle

01:57:07.253 --> 01:57:07.687
that we are working in

01:57:07.754 --> 01:57:08.521
partnership with governor's

01:57:08.588 --> 01:57:11.023
office right now and again now

01:57:11.090 --> 01:57:11.624
is a good time for peace. What

01:57:11.691 --> 01:57:14.861
they- want so that we- there

01:57:14.927 --> 01:57:21.100
will be. Armed with a and

01:57:21.167 --> 01:57:21.701
potentially at the ballot box

01:57:21.768 --> 01:57:26.072
in November. And I am yeah I

01:57:26.139 --> 01:57:28.841
really applaud the work-

01:57:28.908 --> 01:57:31.077
Schaffner side breaking the

01:57:31.144 --> 01:57:34.414
rest the committee wrote push.

01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:35.615
Port and provocative idea. I

01:57:35.681 --> 01:57:39.252
think can be workable a lot of

01:57:39.318 --> 01:57:41.320
work. Idea over the goal line

01:57:41.387 --> 01:57:41.921
one thing I would suggest is

01:57:41.988 --> 01:57:44.724
that- if we're gonna hold

01:57:44.791 --> 01:57:46.793
cities account for outcomes and

01:57:46.859 --> 01:57:50.630
we probably want to avoid. What

01:57:50.696 --> 01:57:51.197
we know could be a lot of

01:57:51.264 --> 01:57:53.633
excitation fixation slit

01:57:53.699 --> 01:57:55.868
litigation if this one check

01:57:55.935 --> 01:57:58.638
criticized harbor for the

01:57:58.704 --> 01:58:06.379
cities and does UC's. That. If

01:58:06.446 --> 01:58:08.080
there is a safe harbor that

01:58:08.147 --> 01:58:11.851
seems to me we what a lot of

01:58:11.918 --> 01:58:12.452
the fear of litigation as well

01:58:12.518 --> 01:58:15.521
as the obviously the cost of

01:58:15.588 --> 01:58:17.457
litigation itself. Hi this and

01:58:17.523 --> 01:58:19.926
just to clarify the proposal is

01:58:19.992 --> 01:58:23.262
only a public right of action.

01:58:23.329 --> 01:58:24.363
Not private right of action

01:58:24.430 --> 01:58:24.831
public. And so only a

01:58:24.897 --> 01:58:27.266
governmental entity and I think

01:58:27.333 --> 01:58:29.802
the postal before and an in.

01:58:29.869 --> 01:58:30.403
General homelessness for the

01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:38.077
state. Of Calipari's. There

01:58:38.144 --> 01:58:40.947
will not be monetary damages

01:58:41.013 --> 01:58:41.747
available but more injunctive

01:58:41.814 --> 01:58:44.217
relief as far as who gets the

01:58:44.283 --> 01:58:49.922
axe to spend the existing funds

01:58:49.989 --> 01:58:50.523
how was funds are spent I am

01:58:50.590 --> 01:58:52.124
particularly quickly and

01:58:52.191 --> 01:58:54.927
effectively. Thank you again

01:58:54.994 --> 01:58:56.596
appreciate your comments- on

01:58:56.662 --> 01:58:58.798
this last topic I've been

01:58:58.865 --> 01:59:01.367
having many conversations with.

01:59:01.434 --> 01:59:02.935
Many DO not just on this panel

01:59:03.002 --> 01:59:03.936
but also throughout the state

01:59:04.003 --> 01:59:08.674
on how we- if ensure that we

01:59:08.741 --> 01:59:09.876
hopefully create a permits are

01:59:09.942 --> 01:59:12.712
so funny at the same time I'm

01:59:12.778 --> 01:59:14.747
all of us at level city county

01:59:14.814 --> 01:59:18.451
level attention regional level-

01:59:18.518 --> 01:59:20.286
and do it in a way that's going

01:59:20.353 --> 01:59:24.223
to move us forward so looking

01:59:24.290 --> 01:59:24.857
for to that work and- thank you

01:59:24.924 --> 01:59:27.226
for being here. Thank you both

01:59:27.293 --> 01:59:29.762
very much for here I and I can

01:59:29.829 --> 01:59:33.866
see your- it looks. Quick

01:59:33.933 --> 01:59:35.001
comment and you're welcome to

01:59:35.067 --> 01:59:43.376
of I some I'm and of. When we.

01:59:43.442 --> 01:59:46.812
I talked de issue of

01:59:46.879 --> 01:59:47.480
accountability one of things we

01:59:47.547 --> 01:59:52.118
need to stop. We are addressing.

01:59:52.184 --> 01:59:53.352
Change is the take place on the

01:59:53.419 --> 01:59:55.288
ground because this is an issue

01:59:55.354 --> 01:59:58.257
that has morphed over time.

01:59:58.324 --> 02:00:01.994
Thank back back when I was the

02:00:02.061 --> 02:00:05.965
mayor local government up

02:00:06.032 --> 02:00:06.532
dressing home assistance Sam

02:00:06.599 --> 02:00:11.137
the issue has. Since that time

02:00:11.203 --> 02:00:16.409
was for the- alrp which is can

02:00:16.475 --> 02:00:17.910
to of our how of crisis and we

02:00:17.977 --> 02:00:22.415
failed in many ways leave to

02:00:22.481 --> 02:00:26.185
keep. Up with those changes and

02:00:26.252 --> 02:00:33.092
so one of the- metric that. I

02:00:33.159 --> 02:00:33.659
think we ought to be judging

02:00:33.726 --> 02:00:34.293
ourselves on it is how we keep

02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:37.930
up with chair. That's because-

02:00:37.997 --> 02:00:39.732
he you make funding system

02:00:39.799 --> 02:00:43.269
thing on the ground changes you

02:00:43.336 --> 02:00:45.905
need to be able to address

02:00:45.972 --> 02:00:49.642
those changes and right now I

02:00:49.709 --> 02:00:51.444
think that is addressing the

02:00:51.510 --> 02:00:54.246
needs of people who are at risk

02:00:54.313 --> 02:00:56.549
for homelessness absolutely ugh

02:00:56.616 --> 02:01:01.320
stop. This because- on the

02:01:01.387 --> 02:01:01.921
street so I want to get that

02:01:01.988 --> 02:01:03.823
out thank you very much for

02:01:03.889 --> 02:01:06.525
here and year time is limited

02:01:06.592 --> 02:01:07.126
if I can come to that I think

02:01:07.193 --> 02:01:07.727
you raise a really important

02:01:07.793 --> 02:01:12.999
point and there are some kind

02:01:13.065 --> 02:01:15.301
of proposals floating.

02:01:15.368 --> 02:01:15.935
Descriptive that would have you

02:01:16.002 --> 02:01:16.969
know this percent to five the

02:01:17.036 --> 02:01:19.538
first. Housing to funding for

02:01:19.605 --> 02:01:23.442
capital and- really. Avoid

02:01:23.509 --> 02:01:26.612
walking some down the rigidly

02:01:26.679 --> 02:01:30.082
for ever we need to have a

02:01:30.149 --> 02:01:30.583
system where people are

02:01:30.650 --> 02:01:34.720
constantly evaluating what our

02:01:34.787 --> 02:01:38.658
jobs we housing housing cost

02:01:38.724 --> 02:01:41.060
balance because we know in the

02:01:41.127 --> 02:01:41.727
bay area that we've been adding

02:01:41.794 --> 02:01:43.596
jobs to this region and not

02:01:43.663 --> 02:01:46.932
produced. The same work. Kate

02:01:46.999 --> 02:01:48.367
and I wish that the def con

02:01:48.434 --> 02:01:51.370
three warning would have gone

02:01:51.437 --> 02:01:52.004
off a little sooner- it is now

02:01:52.071 --> 02:01:57.510
all we- sell. With purely

02:01:57.576 --> 02:01:57.943
economically driven

02:01:58.010 --> 02:02:05.685
homelessness. Which I think is

02:02:05.751 --> 02:02:06.285
a new nominee always present

02:02:06.352 --> 02:02:06.952
I'm seeing Chen is kind of our-

02:02:07.019 --> 02:02:10.523
not in his his head. I really

02:02:10.589 --> 02:02:16.829
want to their score that. We do

02:02:16.896 --> 02:02:19.331
have a fifty years ago we

02:02:19.398 --> 02:02:22.301
didn't have a method like we do

02:02:22.368 --> 02:02:26.405
it today the- easily

02:02:26.472 --> 02:02:29.775
availability easy availability

02:02:29.842 --> 02:02:32.445
cheap availability of. Yeah I

02:02:32.511 --> 02:02:34.680
agree in yes several aye aye.

02:02:34.747 --> 02:02:39.218
The way you pop. Allow CSE to

02:02:39.285 --> 02:02:39.752
be flattered of an- we're

02:02:39.819 --> 02:02:42.621
seeing a lot creative ideas

02:02:42.688 --> 02:02:45.591
rising out of every. Hi there

02:02:45.658 --> 02:02:49.929
is serious about this problem

02:02:49.995 --> 02:02:55.134
and we don't yet have the

02:02:55.201 --> 02:02:55.768
server but we know that this is

02:02:55.835 --> 02:02:56.435
going a. Lot of difference and-

02:02:56.502 --> 02:03:04.977
allow. A first let me say thank

02:03:05.044 --> 02:03:07.046
you for being. My mayor of a

02:03:07.113 --> 02:03:10.082
caring of a bigger schools as a

02:03:10.149 --> 02:03:14.487
low I textures might actually

02:03:14.553 --> 02:03:15.087
be intensifying. Did you play

02:03:15.154 --> 02:03:15.721
you for your leadership. Your

02:03:15.788 --> 02:03:21.627
cities you mention. Jeff your-

02:03:21.694 --> 02:03:27.666
but the house of love on this

02:03:27.733 --> 02:03:28.300
is the quickest thing is mental

02:03:28.367 --> 02:03:32.371
health and drug. Maybe I. Maybe

02:03:32.438 --> 02:03:33.873
for out a bit more and of how

02:03:33.939 --> 02:03:37.309
do you what do you see. Lucia

02:03:37.376 --> 02:03:43.249
certainly Ian into it is. We

02:03:43.315 --> 02:03:48.154
have been very we will in the

02:03:48.220 --> 02:03:50.322
add to it to help was but they

02:03:50.389 --> 02:03:53.492
that we find out of capacity

02:03:53.559 --> 02:03:54.126
and the goal obviously to deal

02:03:54.193 --> 02:03:59.498
with because what what is what

02:03:59.565 --> 02:04:05.971
what are your so I guess. From

02:04:06.038 --> 02:04:09.675
deal with that well I will

02:04:09.742 --> 02:04:14.046
start with the out. Health and

02:04:14.113 --> 02:04:14.713
drug addiction is just. The per

02:04:14.780 --> 02:04:15.314
of the county government not

02:04:15.381 --> 02:04:16.248
the C. of. And will say

02:04:16.315 --> 02:04:18.284
Francisco it both so they can

02:04:18.350 --> 02:04:21.754
talk kind of both I just want

02:04:21.821 --> 02:04:25.057
to have that copy out what I

02:04:25.124 --> 02:04:25.624
can say it we know housing

02:04:25.691 --> 02:04:32.431
first were. You cannot affect.

02:04:32.498 --> 02:04:33.065
Someone's I'm men and they are

02:04:33.132 --> 02:04:39.371
state how housing is health and

02:04:39.438 --> 02:04:44.243
so to the extent that we

02:04:44.310 --> 02:04:46.245
believe that these types of

02:04:46.312 --> 02:04:46.846
kind of medical dollars should

02:04:46.912 --> 02:04:50.015
all in. Seen as a- this but

02:04:50.082 --> 02:04:53.385
with the fat government. Yeah I

02:04:53.452 --> 02:04:55.688
would just that I think you

02:04:55.754 --> 02:04:58.824
know the complexity of homeless

02:04:58.891 --> 02:04:59.458
so I think that we're all well

02:04:59.525 --> 02:05:01.694
of it is very difficult to

02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:03.729
separate the fact and your- I

02:05:03.796 --> 02:05:06.732
bridge. Spec I'd probably be

02:05:06.799 --> 02:05:10.369
drug everyday to and- it's hard

02:05:10.436 --> 02:05:12.972
to know whether the costs of

02:05:13.038 --> 02:05:13.539
the every because we know

02:05:13.606 --> 02:05:15.708
there's a lot of positives job

02:05:15.774 --> 02:05:20.012
loss there's- medical. She's a

02:05:20.079 --> 02:05:21.447
host reasons why people break

02:05:21.513 --> 02:05:25.150
up. But it. Three to some of

02:05:25.217 --> 02:05:27.686
our studies are is it's going

02:05:27.753 --> 02:05:30.489
to take much core at I can say

02:05:30.556 --> 02:05:31.090
it is cost it's certain an

02:05:31.156 --> 02:05:35.995
affected were saying. And at

02:05:36.061 --> 02:05:38.664
you know our speech myself in

02:05:38.731 --> 02:05:41.133
help. Me shop may not agree

02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:41.734
with me on this one we do not

02:05:41.800 --> 02:05:43.035
host thanks but- I do believe.

02:05:43.102 --> 02:05:48.908
We need. Forced the way that us

02:05:48.974 --> 02:05:51.310
to be compassionate with drug

02:05:51.377 --> 02:05:54.246
users or on the street living

02:05:54.313 --> 02:05:56.916
in cabinets living in a and

02:05:56.982 --> 02:05:59.919
rivers and by that I mean.

02:05:59.985 --> 02:06:02.955
There's no way I'm going to get

02:06:03.022 --> 02:06:04.590
someone with a methamphetamine

02:06:04.657 --> 02:06:07.393
addiction to voluntary they say

02:06:07.459 --> 02:06:08.027
it's time for treatment get off

02:06:08.093 --> 02:06:10.996
the street ago when. Sample in

02:06:11.063 --> 02:06:14.233
Honolulu an operation hope it

02:06:14.300 --> 02:06:16.268
having a judge who can order.

02:06:16.335 --> 02:06:18.637
Someone who's been arrested for

02:06:18.704 --> 02:06:22.808
possession not too long since.

02:06:22.875 --> 02:06:25.911
Order them to treat and know

02:06:25.978 --> 02:06:26.478
that there is a potential a

02:06:26.545 --> 02:06:28.147
jailer two days in jail as a

02:06:28.213 --> 02:06:30.849
consequence if they don't go. I

02:06:30.916 --> 02:06:31.517
and then and then testing them

02:06:31.583 --> 02:06:34.286
for. The point is not to

02:06:34.353 --> 02:06:36.522
criminalize abuse not.

02:06:36.588 --> 02:06:41.827
Listeners I'm not a note. To in

02:06:41.894 --> 02:06:42.428
and with the Camanche system

02:06:42.494 --> 02:06:43.896
twenty us to get on the

02:06:43.963 --> 02:06:49.101
treatment. And right now we're

02:06:49.168 --> 02:06:52.237
not seeing any Bob. Willingness

02:06:52.304 --> 02:06:53.672
to do to make that happen now

02:06:53.739 --> 02:06:54.239
the methamphetamine yes is

02:06:54.306 --> 02:06:56.775
service public safety but to

02:06:56.842 --> 02:06:57.343
the- using as well as the

02:06:57.409 --> 02:06:59.945
surrounding. The for prosecutor.

02:07:00.012 --> 02:07:01.146
Hi city now to look at the-

02:07:01.213 --> 02:07:05.451
these blood of folks simply.

02:07:05.517 --> 02:07:07.152
Have no serious violent priors

02:07:07.219 --> 02:07:09.955
committing violent crimes

02:07:10.022 --> 02:07:10.556
because of long term Matheus

02:07:10.622 --> 02:07:11.357
window eyes and psychosis. So I

02:07:11.423 --> 02:07:13.926
think we have treat the- play

02:07:13.993 --> 02:07:16.795
now to get along sentences not

02:07:16.862 --> 02:07:18.197
go back to the war on drugs but

02:07:18.263 --> 02:07:21.934
rather to have a judge who has

02:07:22.001 --> 02:07:22.501
the authority to be able to

02:07:22.568 --> 02:07:26.939
tell somebody you got a-

02:07:27.006 --> 02:07:27.439
problem you got to go to

02:07:27.506 --> 02:07:28.007
treatment. Thank you and I

02:07:28.073 --> 02:07:29.742
guess. I've let me for say that

02:07:29.808 --> 02:07:32.745
that that. When welcome

02:07:32.811 --> 02:07:33.278
addition. Good addiction.

02:07:33.345 --> 02:07:35.547
Certainly a lot of Los or Joe

02:07:35.614 --> 02:07:38.417
I've I've so talk to the met

02:07:38.484 --> 02:07:41.553
them the my community and end

02:07:41.620 --> 02:07:43.689
up developing you know but you

02:07:43.756 --> 02:07:44.256
know certainly illness. When

02:07:44.323 --> 02:07:46.058
they're on the street so I

02:07:46.125 --> 02:07:51.663
needs the cause and effect is

02:07:51.730 --> 02:07:52.264
of course a very complicated

02:07:52.331 --> 02:07:52.798
situation will say that.

02:07:52.865 --> 02:07:57.202
Homeless end up in a zero. Yes

02:07:57.269 --> 02:07:57.870
citizens are paying for. I is a

02:07:57.936 --> 02:08:03.208
very the most expense promises

02:08:03.275 --> 02:08:03.776
services addiction services

02:08:03.842 --> 02:08:05.444
would you be open to the idea

02:08:05.511 --> 02:08:12.317
mental health or G. top or-

02:08:12.384 --> 02:08:14.620
perceptions of. A is double

02:08:14.686 --> 02:08:19.958
under Medicare. Some the look.

02:08:20.025 --> 02:08:22.795
In in in terms of like for

02:08:22.861 --> 02:08:23.462
example in the in the there is

02:08:23.529 --> 02:08:29.401
I've asked the governor to ask

02:08:29.468 --> 02:08:33.338
for- Brian de vote fry and did

02:08:33.405 --> 02:08:34.940
to- provide flexibility and-

02:08:35.007 --> 02:08:39.044
that that you entered. Well no

02:08:39.111 --> 02:08:42.181
it's the it's the eleventh ever

02:08:42.247 --> 02:08:44.616
how indeed to give the same of

02:08:44.683 --> 02:08:47.219
in covering service under it's

02:08:47.286 --> 02:08:51.223
just a mental. Housing Hey.

02:08:51.290 --> 02:08:51.790
I'll give all these aye it

02:08:51.857 --> 02:08:53.025
maybe the and that too in a

02:08:53.092 --> 02:08:57.529
week. I could that. Should an

02:08:57.596 --> 02:08:59.164
be spent to stably people that

02:08:59.231 --> 02:09:01.767
are fighting drug addiction and

02:09:01.834 --> 02:09:04.670
mental health because we know

02:09:04.736 --> 02:09:06.438
that that is the most effective

02:09:06.505 --> 02:09:08.540
conditions for successful

02:09:08.607 --> 02:09:10.242
treatment. I believe the cost

02:09:10.309 --> 02:09:11.844
of housing could and should be

02:09:11.910 --> 02:09:14.012
covered through Medicaid

02:09:14.079 --> 02:09:15.948
reimbursements. Yeah I agree

02:09:16.014 --> 02:09:18.117
and I also apply the

02:09:18.183 --> 02:09:19.852
governor's- initiative on that

02:09:19.918 --> 02:09:23.956
and thank you very much. Great

02:09:24.022 --> 02:09:24.556
thank you thank you thank you

02:09:24.623 --> 02:09:27.926
both for. Being here today- it

02:09:27.993 --> 02:09:29.695
really appreciate the

02:09:29.761 --> 02:09:31.997
presentation you made. Could

02:09:32.064 --> 02:09:35.634
you talk about. How how quickly

02:09:35.701 --> 02:09:37.970
you spent that first round of

02:09:38.036 --> 02:09:40.405
funding from heap- I mean just

02:09:40.472 --> 02:09:42.174
rob just just a rough terms I

02:09:42.241 --> 02:09:42.808
don't need to specific day but

02:09:42.875 --> 02:09:46.645
just. To get a sense of- on

02:09:46.712 --> 02:09:49.615
that the center for see I think

02:09:49.681 --> 02:09:52.184
that you both both had I really

02:09:52.251 --> 02:09:52.818
appreciate what I know them but

02:09:52.885 --> 02:09:54.253
we work on together. We work to

02:09:54.319 --> 02:09:56.121
make sure that we discussion

02:09:56.188 --> 02:09:59.892
that the parents are ready to

02:09:59.958 --> 02:10:03.896
once they got money they were.

02:10:03.962 --> 02:10:04.530
Ready to deploy that money. Yes

02:10:04.596 --> 02:10:06.465
in a German. Well you be

02:10:06.532 --> 02:10:07.032
passage you get to be better

02:10:07.099 --> 02:10:08.267
make sure you using it. We've I

02:10:08.333 --> 02:10:12.504
can tell you I know the

02:10:12.571 --> 02:10:13.071
deadline is I think a major

02:10:13.138 --> 02:10:15.440
twenty twenty one will can be

02:10:15.507 --> 02:10:17.376
well of in front of that I

02:10:17.442 --> 02:10:21.547
suspect. We're action on the

02:10:21.613 --> 02:10:23.248
second time young community

02:10:23.315 --> 02:10:23.882
that were usually the sponsors

02:10:23.949 --> 02:10:24.783
that construction on that money

02:10:24.850 --> 02:10:27.753
is used. And we were told that

02:10:27.819 --> 02:10:31.190
we there is application in the

02:10:31.256 --> 02:10:31.757
very first day that you're

02:10:31.823 --> 02:10:36.962
accepting the heap application-

02:10:37.029 --> 02:10:38.830
because we're anxious to start

02:10:38.897 --> 02:10:44.636
spending and we are prepared we

02:10:44.703 --> 02:10:46.238
had again raise private funds.

02:10:46.305 --> 02:10:46.872
To pop it the commute the model

02:10:46.939 --> 02:10:50.842
impact think I don't know. Part

02:10:50.909 --> 02:10:58.850
what hello. As actually are

02:10:58.917 --> 02:11:01.386
helped fund the pilots of our

02:11:01.453 --> 02:11:06.391
cabin community model. So that

02:11:06.458 --> 02:11:13.932
we were. So yeah your cabin can

02:11:13.999 --> 02:11:19.004
have much lower- positive exit

02:11:19.071 --> 02:11:22.374
rates are longer standing ones

02:11:22.441 --> 02:11:26.745
have very high- exit rates you

02:11:26.812 --> 02:11:28.680
know well over 60% the average

02:11:28.747 --> 02:11:32.050
all of that get about 55% right

02:11:32.117 --> 02:11:34.253
now positive exits in housing

02:11:34.319 --> 02:11:36.121
from the little cabins- but we

02:11:36.188 --> 02:11:39.992
were. We had already started

02:11:40.058 --> 02:11:42.394
front in some of the money

02:11:42.461 --> 02:11:43.962
waiting for our checks from the

02:11:44.029 --> 02:11:51.103
state to come out we are very.

02:11:51.169 --> 02:11:52.237
Are very impatient people. I

02:11:52.304 --> 02:11:57.309
just know that. I should also.

02:11:57.376 --> 02:11:57.843
Any trouble up some these

02:11:57.909 --> 02:12:02.547
programs money aside for

02:12:02.614 --> 02:12:03.148
operating for a couple years-

02:12:03.215 --> 02:12:07.552
so. The committees recess I two

02:12:07.619 --> 02:12:11.523
years that money obviously will

02:12:11.590 --> 02:12:12.124
get used until the Dodgers got

02:12:12.190 --> 02:12:17.896
and I. Mers are patient co. So

02:12:17.963 --> 02:12:20.399
sounds like he with the help

02:12:20.465 --> 02:12:20.932
dollars and are gonna be

02:12:20.999 --> 02:12:25.904
purpose to soon. Sounds like

02:12:25.971 --> 02:12:26.505
you already have planned for

02:12:26.571 --> 02:12:28.774
the for that money as well yes.

02:12:28.840 --> 02:12:30.642
We've already so our applet as

02:12:30.709 --> 02:12:35.714
a big city. In now is in. In in

02:12:35.781 --> 02:12:43.021
the new shelter capacity that

02:12:43.088 --> 02:12:44.489
we've added one to sustain it.

02:12:44.556 --> 02:12:48.694
To improve the flow to a- bàn

02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:52.464
three how the floor. I can. All

02:12:52.531 --> 02:12:53.065
use of second galley and the

02:12:53.131 --> 02:12:57.135
guy. It and then maintaining

02:12:57.202 --> 02:13:03.275
their much higher level of

02:13:03.342 --> 02:13:03.875
ability to get people off the

02:13:03.942 --> 02:13:04.476
streets and in this and see.

02:13:04.543 --> 02:13:05.110
But also to move them along to

02:13:05.177 --> 02:13:08.347
pay minute. Housing we also are

02:13:08.413 --> 02:13:10.115
used it for the for time so

02:13:10.182 --> 02:13:12.651
address I haven't Reyes enough

02:13:12.718 --> 02:13:15.787
I which is the incomes. Of the

02:13:15.854 --> 02:13:19.391
homelessness problem so this

02:13:19.458 --> 02:13:19.958
will be the first time that

02:13:20.025 --> 02:13:20.459
we're making. A major

02:13:20.525 --> 02:13:25.063
investment very targeted

02:13:25.130 --> 02:13:29.034
workforce program to actually.

02:13:29.101 --> 02:13:30.369
Seen the incomes. The

02:13:30.435 --> 02:13:32.304
employability. Police St.

02:13:32.371 --> 02:13:36.108
Visual yeah I know I'm- and a

02:13:36.174 --> 02:13:37.809
council Tuesday approved were

02:13:37.876 --> 02:13:40.379
ready to go fired up. Great

02:13:40.445 --> 02:13:44.149
thank you it incense the

02:13:44.216 --> 02:13:46.952
governor's current also really

02:13:47.018 --> 02:13:48.053
has a focus on regional

02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:50.889
collaboration I know shop you

02:13:50.956 --> 02:13:54.092
may. This sure a little bit

02:13:54.159 --> 02:13:55.193
more about that now the car few

02:13:55.260 --> 02:13:58.463
examples which is all

02:13:58.530 --> 02:13:59.097
understanding you know our are

02:13:59.164 --> 02:14:01.233
there other gaps from the

02:14:01.299 --> 02:14:04.202
region we know there gaps in

02:14:04.269 --> 02:14:05.203
terms housing production

02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:09.174
because we were that's as two

02:14:09.241 --> 02:14:10.208
of the three big cities here

02:14:10.275 --> 02:14:13.245
seems like everybody's fine

02:14:13.311 --> 02:14:15.180
telling Sanders. Francisco to

02:14:15.247 --> 02:14:15.781
build but when you ask each

02:14:15.847 --> 02:14:17.983
other vigils he's the bill they

02:14:18.049 --> 02:14:20.919
don't quite. You could. Not

02:14:20.986 --> 02:14:22.587
talk about some of the reason

02:14:22.654 --> 02:14:26.057
issue you know we to school

02:14:26.124 --> 02:14:26.625
collaborations and again it

02:14:26.691 --> 02:14:31.863
kind of takes that you know

02:14:31.930 --> 02:14:32.464
block by block knowledge that.

02:14:32.531 --> 02:14:35.267
Arguably only me. So for

02:14:35.333 --> 02:14:38.770
example our cabin community. Is

02:14:38.837 --> 02:14:47.012
actually bringing. This. Can't

02:14:47.078 --> 02:14:48.079
men and is meant the strategy

02:14:48.146 --> 02:14:53.919
as well and there was a huge

02:14:53.985 --> 02:14:55.287
encampment that was right Board

02:14:55.353 --> 02:14:56.087
clinic. Although mostly

02:14:56.154 --> 02:14:57.155
Emeryville side but we have.

02:14:57.222 --> 02:15:04.996
Cal that was ME gave us a part

02:15:05.063 --> 02:15:07.199
that the county actually

02:15:07.265 --> 02:15:12.637
divvied up there keep funds to

02:15:12.704 --> 02:15:14.739
the different cities- after

02:15:14.806 --> 02:15:15.841
deducting Oakland's direct

02:15:15.907 --> 02:15:17.542
allocation then they divided it

02:15:17.609 --> 02:15:22.681
by the- but- the county to

02:15:22.747 --> 02:15:25.784
stand up to cabin communities

02:15:25.851 --> 02:15:30.922
and a safe RV park that most

02:15:30.989 --> 02:15:31.590
people from the Emeryville side

02:15:31.656 --> 02:15:32.457
of the line that was right on

02:15:32.524 --> 02:15:36.361
our our border we also knew

02:15:36.428 --> 02:15:37.629
that they had a building that

02:15:37.696 --> 02:15:38.230
was formally being used as a

02:15:38.296 --> 02:15:42.000
temporary- and formally. But on

02:15:42.067 --> 02:15:46.438
Mr their part. There leasing a

02:15:46.505 --> 02:15:47.806
stop building for. At no cost

02:15:47.873 --> 02:15:53.078
that's a were funded only. It

02:15:53.144 --> 02:15:55.747
it it memory fell out and then

02:15:55.814 --> 02:15:57.782
find out in the governor was

02:15:57.849 --> 02:16:03.221
giving these FEMA trailers-

02:16:03.288 --> 02:16:03.855
just it feels like a few weeks

02:16:03.922 --> 02:16:10.529
ago the state or to. County to

02:16:10.595 --> 02:16:11.129
read I county in able to draw

02:16:11.196 --> 02:16:12.230
the. So that they provide.

02:16:12.297 --> 02:16:14.032
Provide that are actually.

02:16:14.099 --> 02:16:17.002
Helping the P. that will living

02:16:17.068 --> 02:16:19.771
those trailers so we provided

02:16:19.838 --> 02:16:22.641
the land we provided that

02:16:22.707 --> 02:16:23.975
little caught to ready the

02:16:24.042 --> 02:16:27.746
sites to actually be able to

02:16:27.812 --> 02:16:29.948
accept the trailers a big part

02:16:30.015 --> 02:16:32.284
of the services that come from

02:16:32.350 --> 02:16:35.820
the county again with the.

02:16:35.887 --> 02:16:36.354
State so that was a great

02:16:36.421 --> 02:16:39.424
example of true. That is

02:16:39.491 --> 02:16:44.229
sustainable thank. Hi yep you

02:16:44.296 --> 02:16:46.531

their own. What is result in a

02:17:01.947 --> 02:17:06.851
real. Genuine partnership

between seeing county yeah this

02:17:12.691 --> 02:17:14.726
is. That's not all the cities

02:17:14.793 --> 02:17:17.362
but the city cal. Show will.

02:17:17.429 --> 02:17:18.597
Prevention county it is worth

02:17:18.663 --> 02:17:20.765
invest in will has kicked in

02:17:20.832 --> 02:17:23.268
for me and oversee results

02:17:23.335 --> 02:17:23.935
today. We do released a hundred

02:17:24.002 --> 02:17:27.072

this year. I in in all those

02:17:34.112 --> 02:17:35.880
extremely low income projects

02:17:35.947 --> 02:17:38.717
the counties making commits

02:17:38.783 --> 02:17:43.321
provide support services- wraps

02:17:43.388 --> 02:17:43.922
so in lockstep obviously their

02:17:43.989 --> 02:17:45.457

02:20:38.596 --> 02:20:40.365
inventory and thus the lack of

02:20:40.431 --> 02:20:43.301

ship to enter all the can of.

02:22:26.337 --> 02:22:28.139
Programs are able are available

02:22:28.206 --> 02:22:28.673

options to close this gap.

02:22:57.769 --> 02:23:00.071
Unfortunately even if the city

an ongoing state fund

02:29:29.126 --> 02:29:30.928

county has participated in and

02:30:16.674 --> 02:30:18.509
really. A ripple collaborative

02:30:18.576 --> 02:30:19.076
model- in part because the

02:30:19.143 --> 02:30:20.911
measure rates in the ongoing

02:30:20.978 --> 02:30:23.080

departments we work with a

02:30:31.789 --> 02:30:34.058
multiple. Authorities as well

02:30:34.125 --> 02:30:37.128
their seventeen I believe in

02:30:37.194 --> 02:30:38.796
the county of Los Angeles-

02:30:38.863 --> 02:30:39.296

organizations- the county I

02:30:46.971 --> 02:30:47.471
truly believe that the half

02:30:47.538 --> 02:30:49.407
funding will strengthen the

02:30:49.473 --> 02:30:51.275
regional collection has been

02:30:51.342 --> 02:30:52.676
building. Since the adoption

02:30:52.743 --> 02:30:54.245
adoption of the county homes a

02:30:54.311 --> 02:30:56.046
strategy in two thousand seven

02:30:56.113 --> 02:30:56.680
actually the same day that the

02:30:56.747 --> 02:31:00.518
city adopt there's a G. we

02:31:00.584 --> 02:31:03.621
work. In tandem on the

02:31:03.687 --> 02:31:06.924
strategies and jurisdiction's

02:31:06.991 --> 02:31:12.430
voter for the energies the same

02:31:12.496 --> 02:31:13.264
day- I think that really it.

02:31:13.330 --> 02:31:21.372
Should no funds. For again.

02:31:21.439 --> 02:31:23.441

you for I am so I am not to get

02:31:31.649 --> 02:31:34.185
to and without lot of this is

02:31:34.251 --> 02:31:34.819
already been covered in we did

02:31:34.885 --> 02:31:36.854
pull together a bit of the

02:31:36.921 --> 02:31:37.488
behind all of you and that you

02:31:37.555 --> 02:31:41.258
have. With you- that goes into

02:31:41.325 --> 02:31:43.160
a little bit and that

02:31:43.227 --> 02:31:45.863
California homeless Corning

02:31:45.930 --> 02:31:47.465
financing councils goals which

02:31:47.531 --> 02:31:51.535
include- a strategic plan

02:31:51.602 --> 02:31:54.772
process. Call out our owner

02:31:54.839 --> 02:31:57.007
rate. I'm at the- a bit more

02:31:57.074 --> 02:32:00.945
detail happened that hand out-

02:32:01.011 --> 02:32:01.479
but real quickly a couple

02:32:01.545 --> 02:32:04.715
things on here. As a reminder

02:32:04.782 --> 02:32:06.250
that the five million dollars

02:32:06.317 --> 02:32:08.419
it was at night FY eighteen

02:32:08.486 --> 02:32:10.621
ninety. All the three three C.

02:32:10.688 --> 02:32:13.123
Wicks by next and so are we

02:32:13.190 --> 02:32:14.859
recently received in your our

02:32:14.925 --> 02:32:18.062
first Inori ports on this we

02:32:18.128 --> 02:32:19.530
are as mentioned by lot as we

02:32:19.597 --> 02:32:22.833
are in the midst of analyzing-

02:32:22.900 --> 02:32:25.870
all of that road- information

02:32:25.936 --> 02:32:26.470
right now but a couple things

02:32:26.537 --> 02:32:28.472
we are seeing from that that I

02:32:28.539 --> 02:32:30.574
think might be of interest- we

02:32:30.641 --> 02:32:33.911
really are serving. Seeing is

02:32:33.978 --> 02:32:35.246
spent across the state and what

02:32:35.312 --> 02:32:36.447
we're seeing in. Front pockets.

02:32:36.514 --> 02:32:38.415
I'm either around. Made of

02:32:38.482 --> 02:32:41.619
approaches with the- number ski

02:32:41.685 --> 02:32:42.219
thing that they had seen into

02:32:42.286 --> 02:32:43.654
in their already and going to

02:32:43.721 --> 02:32:45.256
scale- and reassessing

02:32:45.322 --> 02:32:48.225
revamping systems and so and

02:32:48.292 --> 02:32:48.792
hearing a lot about how and

02:32:48.859 --> 02:32:50.194
spend specifically around

02:32:50.261 --> 02:32:52.763
emergency shelter in capital

02:32:52.830 --> 02:32:56.000
development we are seeing that

02:32:56.066 --> 02:32:56.600
but I think specifically- how

02:32:56.667 --> 02:33:00.604
that's- within the system of

02:33:00.671 --> 02:33:01.238
communities is an interesting

02:33:01.305 --> 02:33:07.077
piece of it as well I'm we are

02:33:07.144 --> 02:33:07.711
also things I'm really at. Ste.

02:33:07.778 --> 02:33:08.312
Investment concert every from

02:33:08.379 --> 02:33:16.887
prevention. Andrew for how user

02:33:16.954 --> 02:33:17.521
accessing homelessness services

02:33:17.588 --> 02:33:18.088
I'm and I would also mention

02:33:18.155 --> 02:33:20.190
and- you know you heard from

02:33:20.257 --> 02:33:20.791
for mayor shaft or a really

02:33:20.858 --> 02:33:25.229
strong commitment to housing

02:33:25.296 --> 02:33:28.032
first we're seeing some really

02:33:28.098 --> 02:33:30.534
great- commitments and proof

02:33:30.601 --> 02:33:31.101
proof of concept X. explains

02:33:31.168 --> 02:33:32.536
coming from the report. To be

02:33:32.603 --> 02:33:37.107
analyzed. Is as so nice timely

02:33:37.174 --> 02:33:40.878
hearing I want to give mega

02:33:40.945 --> 02:33:42.413
call out for being city of a

02:33:42.479 --> 02:33:44.882
was the very first application

02:33:44.949 --> 02:33:45.482
raise the this year I think

02:33:45.549 --> 02:33:47.551
that's probably wild mayor

02:33:47.618 --> 02:33:50.688
shaft left to not be- they were

02:33:50.754 --> 02:33:54.124
numbered unfortunately. Will

02:33:54.191 --> 02:33:54.892
have to take second place here-

02:33:54.959 --> 02:33:57.661
but that is for the forty two

02:33:57.728 --> 02:33:58.262
years is a fifty county and

02:33:58.329 --> 02:34:05.169
third cities I'm six. To be

02:34:05.235 --> 02:34:05.736
spent although through June

02:34:05.803 --> 02:34:08.038
after twenty. So just we- so

02:34:08.105 --> 02:34:10.074
some delays I know that this is

02:34:10.140 --> 02:34:10.674
been a conversation point in

02:34:10.741 --> 02:34:13.844
receiving those applications

02:34:13.911 --> 02:34:14.478
been hearing anecdotally that a

02:34:14.545 --> 02:34:16.880
lot of that is because many

02:34:16.947 --> 02:34:17.448
communities are in the midst

02:34:17.514 --> 02:34:18.082
of. Conduct your point in time

02:34:18.148 --> 02:34:22.953
counting so fully appreciate.

02:34:23.020 --> 02:34:27.358
En en I'm a- on that in any way

02:34:27.424 --> 02:34:27.992
while wait for apple. It just

02:34:28.058 --> 02:34:29.226
makes double that harder in the

02:34:29.293 --> 02:34:31.795
them. But we manage I. Does a

02:34:31.862 --> 02:34:34.598
few different. That I do think

02:34:34.665 --> 02:34:35.265
I'm- to out in addition to the

02:34:35.332 --> 02:34:35.866
fact that counties are giving

02:34:35.933 --> 02:34:36.433
this funding there are some

02:34:36.500 --> 02:34:38.102
answers to. Allah this is the

02:34:38.168 --> 02:34:43.340
final around but it does I will.

02:34:43.407 --> 02:34:43.907
That were in the midst Kings

02:34:43.974 --> 02:34:46.243
through he really intended to

02:34:46.310 --> 02:34:48.278
be. Amer at our go quick and

02:34:48.345 --> 02:34:50.014
this is our hope is for this

02:34:50.080 --> 02:34:50.648
that there's a little bit more

02:34:50.714 --> 02:34:51.915
of measurable goals to come out

02:34:51.982 --> 02:34:55.285
of the applications. I'm really

02:34:55.352 --> 02:34:56.820
thinking about have spending is

02:34:56.887 --> 02:34:57.454
being spent in these different

02:34:57.521 --> 02:35:00.557
buckets- in trying to.

02:35:00.624 --> 02:35:04.862
Understand. How this piece of

02:35:04.928 --> 02:35:07.531
the funding. A strong. Sort of

02:35:07.598 --> 02:35:09.633
a commitment to regional

02:35:09.700 --> 02:35:10.167
collaborations that we're

02:35:10.234 --> 02:35:11.568
expecting to see in these

02:35:11.635 --> 02:35:16.073
applications from he we put. In

02:35:16.140 --> 02:35:16.640
a letter of support from all

02:35:16.707 --> 02:35:19.777
going. Insurance the better

02:35:19.843 --> 02:35:22.413
term but we- you know. Money

02:35:22.479 --> 02:35:24.581
and CO Tienen really wanted be

02:35:24.648 --> 02:35:27.851
how the three and the and

02:35:27.918 --> 02:35:28.452
community I using their funds

02:35:28.519 --> 02:35:29.053
in a co strategy and our our

02:35:29.119 --> 02:35:30.454
looking forward to reviewing

02:35:30.521 --> 02:35:32.089
game pieces of that. And I

02:35:32.156 --> 02:35:33.857
think I'll stay for now and in

02:35:33.924 --> 02:35:36.894
and time unless there's

02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:40.431
addition one don't well wait

02:35:40.497 --> 02:35:41.065
for all the panelists to go and

02:35:41.131 --> 02:35:48.939
then we. And I am a professor

02:35:49.006 --> 02:35:50.874
of medicine at UCSF and I

02:35:50.941 --> 02:35:52.943
direct the UCSF center for

02:35:53.010 --> 02:35:54.645
volatile populations. And the

02:35:54.712 --> 02:35:56.847
UCSF homelessness and housing

02:35:56.914 --> 02:35:58.749
initiative and I come to this

02:35:58.816 --> 02:35:59.283
work as a physician and a

02:35:59.349 --> 02:36:00.884
researcher who studies

02:36:00.951 --> 02:36:02.820
homelessness- I don't need to

02:36:02.886 --> 02:36:04.955
tell you that this is one of

02:36:05.022 --> 02:36:06.724
the most pressing issues facing

02:36:06.790 --> 02:36:09.293
California- that one the- only

02:36:09.359 --> 02:36:11.028
one in nine. Americans live in

02:36:11.095 --> 02:36:13.030
California we have the honor of

02:36:13.097 --> 02:36:14.932
having one in four. People

02:36:14.998 --> 02:36:16.867
experiencing homelessness in

02:36:16.934 --> 02:36:19.336
this country like the rest of

02:36:19.403 --> 02:36:21.105
the country homelessness in

02:36:21.171 --> 02:36:22.740
California disproportionately

02:36:22.806 --> 02:36:24.908
affects certain groups. A

02:36:24.975 --> 02:36:25.476
predominately those who are

02:36:25.542 --> 02:36:27.478
black American in indigenous

02:36:27.544 --> 02:36:31.381
American. California also bears

02:36:31.448 --> 02:36:31.882
the burden of having the

02:36:31.949 --> 02:36:33.617
highest proportion of people

02:36:33.684 --> 02:36:35.285
experiencing homelessness who

02:36:35.352 --> 02:36:36.820
are on sheltered with about

02:36:36.887 --> 02:36:38.956
sixty nine percent. Of home of

02:36:39.022 --> 02:36:41.258
Californians living without

02:36:41.325 --> 02:36:42.926
shelters most of the increases

02:36:42.993 --> 02:36:44.695
that we've seen in the past two

02:36:44.762 --> 02:36:46.897
years have been amongst those

02:36:46.964 --> 02:36:48.732
living on sheltered. I think

02:36:48.799 --> 02:36:49.366
it's important to say that the

02:36:49.433 --> 02:36:51.101
increases in homelessness that

02:36:51.168 --> 02:36:53.137
we've seen have not been due to

02:36:53.203 --> 02:36:55.038
failures of the evidence based

02:36:55.105 --> 02:36:57.441
policies that focus on ending

02:36:57.508 --> 02:36:59.143
homelessness. Rather there due

02:36:59.209 --> 02:37:01.411
to the structural conditions

02:37:01.478 --> 02:37:04.214
that we face in California

02:37:04.281 --> 02:37:05.449
predominantly the critical lack

02:37:05.516 --> 02:37:08.152
of housing for extremely low

02:37:08.218 --> 02:37:09.520
income Californians.

02:37:09.586 --> 02:37:10.053
Intertwined with incomes

02:37:10.120 --> 02:37:16.360
quality. Perhaps this. He did

02:37:16.426 --> 02:37:16.927
it I tried to for us to per

02:37:16.994 --> 02:37:18.362
people from and homelessness.

02:37:18.428 --> 02:37:18.962
And it has created a problem

02:37:19.029 --> 02:37:21.532
where it's hard for us to and

02:37:21.598 --> 02:37:24.034
have people eggs as quickly as

02:37:24.101 --> 02:37:26.904
possible. California right now

02:37:26.970 --> 02:37:29.640
they're only twenty two units

02:37:29.706 --> 02:37:30.808
housing that are available and

02:37:30.874 --> 02:37:31.408
affordable for every a hundred

02:37:31.475 --> 02:37:32.910
extremely low in. The house. So

02:37:32.976 --> 02:37:35.612
extra. For those who class 30%

02:37:35.679 --> 02:37:38.015
at the end. And we are the

02:37:38.081 --> 02:37:39.449
second word state in the nation

02:37:39.516 --> 02:37:41.885
on this metric. The primary

02:37:41.952 --> 02:37:43.954
focus for solving this crisis

02:37:44.021 --> 02:37:45.756
is passed to include a plan to

02:37:45.823 --> 02:37:48.325
produce preserve and protect

02:37:48.392 --> 02:37:49.827
housing that is affordable to

02:37:49.893 --> 02:37:52.462
it for extreme low income

02:37:52.529 --> 02:37:53.096
households. This is gonna take

02:37:53.163 --> 02:37:54.832
dedicated efforts at every

02:37:54.898 --> 02:37:58.135
level of government but if we

02:37:58.202 --> 02:37:58.735
don't do it we're not going to

02:37:58.802 --> 02:38:00.103
get there. For people who

02:38:00.170 --> 02:38:00.671
experience from homelessness

02:38:00.737 --> 02:38:01.872
and struggle with behavioral

02:38:01.939 --> 02:38:02.973
health challenges like we were

02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:05.142
talking about substance use and

02:38:05.209 --> 02:38:06.677
mental health. You know what

02:38:06.743 --> 02:38:07.311
the answer is and we have good

02:38:07.377 --> 02:38:09.379
evidence it works we estimate

02:38:09.446 --> 02:38:11.648
that about 20% of people who

02:38:11.715 --> 02:38:13.450
experience homelessness fall

02:38:13.517 --> 02:38:17.221
into this category probably at

02:38:17.287 --> 02:38:17.855
any given time about half of

02:38:17.921 --> 02:38:19.890
people who are experiencing it.

02:38:19.957 --> 02:38:22.226
Are in this category because a

02:38:22.292 --> 02:38:24.561
stay homeless longer permits

02:38:24.628 --> 02:38:25.095
part of housing is simply

02:38:25.162 --> 02:38:27.164
housing that is permanent it's

02:38:27.231 --> 02:38:28.899
not a short term subsidy that's

02:38:28.966 --> 02:38:30.968
affordable to extremely low

02:38:31.034 --> 02:38:31.535
income renters. And that is

02:38:31.602 --> 02:38:34.872
offered with voluntary support

02:38:34.938 --> 02:38:35.472
of services things like case

02:38:35.539 --> 02:38:37.107
management to have meant and

02:38:37.174 --> 02:38:39.543
the like. For it to work as you

02:38:39.610 --> 02:38:40.811
heard from mayor shaft it has

02:38:40.878 --> 02:38:41.378
to be offered on a housing

02:38:41.445 --> 02:38:45.115
first basis that means for this

02:38:45.182 --> 02:38:45.716
to work the housing has to be

02:38:45.782 --> 02:38:47.451
offered with out the

02:38:47.517 --> 02:38:50.053
precondition. Friday or

02:38:50.120 --> 02:38:51.955
precondition of engagement in

02:38:52.022 --> 02:38:54.091
mental health care it can seem

02:38:54.157 --> 02:38:55.959
counterintuitive but the

02:38:56.026 --> 02:38:57.761
evidence. Stark and click. The

02:38:57.828 --> 02:38:59.897
services have to be voluntary.

02:38:59.963 --> 02:39:02.699
We know if we do this we can be

02:39:02.766 --> 02:39:04.868
successful and I just wanna

02:39:04.935 --> 02:39:07.671
point out that we've just read

02:39:07.738 --> 02:39:11.441
it completing a dance to Clara

02:39:11.508 --> 02:39:16.146
county. Downturn I. Am disabled

02:39:16.213 --> 02:39:16.780
folks are chronically homeless

02:39:16.847 --> 02:39:18.649
the most. Level of April to sit.

02:39:18.715 --> 02:39:20.918
We found for of them we'll had

02:39:20.984 --> 02:39:21.551
a hundred and four twenty four

02:39:21.618 --> 02:39:23.287
units a permits part of housing

02:39:23.353 --> 02:39:25.389
and super randomly selected who

02:39:25.455 --> 02:39:27.758
would get it and- not. Of those

02:39:27.824 --> 02:39:29.426
who were randomly selected to

02:39:29.493 --> 02:39:31.795
get it eighty five percent.

02:39:31.862 --> 02:39:33.964
Successfully house and they

02:39:34.031 --> 02:39:36.566
spent over 90% of their nights

02:39:36.633 --> 02:39:37.167
after the engaged and housing

02:39:37.234 --> 02:39:40.304
house Ste. There were that. Red

02:39:40.370 --> 02:39:42.472
this disabled population we

02:39:42.539 --> 02:39:44.574
expect for populations were

02:39:44.641 --> 02:39:45.108
slightly lower levels of

02:39:45.175 --> 02:39:46.643
disability that the numbers are

02:39:46.710 --> 02:39:49.446
even better. To create expand-

02:39:49.513 --> 02:39:52.182
PSH we really need to create

02:39:52.249 --> 02:39:55.185
the LA housing. It's good to

02:39:55.252 --> 02:39:55.819
know that most of the services

02:39:55.886 --> 02:40:00.657
could be paid through Medicaid

02:40:00.724 --> 02:40:01.258
particularly with the waiver

02:40:01.325 --> 02:40:03.160
that has been- suggested and

02:40:03.226 --> 02:40:06.630
three secretary got. And so how

02:40:06.697 --> 02:40:10.033
about the other 80% to get. How

02:40:10.100 --> 02:40:11.335
really need to read efforts to.

02:40:11.401 --> 02:40:13.236
From current and we also need

02:40:13.303 --> 02:40:13.804
for on shortening at the set

02:40:13.870 --> 02:40:18.108
when they do occur I've spoken

02:40:18.175 --> 02:40:18.675
to some of you before now

02:40:18.742 --> 02:40:20.811
research we found that half of

02:40:20.877 --> 02:40:22.779
the single adults in this state

02:40:22.846 --> 02:40:25.449
who are homeless or fifteen

02:40:25.515 --> 02:40:27.184
older and 44% of them had never

02:40:27.250 --> 02:40:28.885
been homeless before the age of

02:40:28.952 --> 02:40:29.553
fifty but what we're finding is

02:40:29.619 --> 02:40:31.588
that once they become homeless.

02:40:31.655 --> 02:40:33.223
We'll hear from my colleague

02:40:33.290 --> 02:40:35.726
Jamie some really- examples of

02:40:35.792 --> 02:40:38.462
ways that we can intervene but

02:40:38.528 --> 02:40:41.231
I will say that we know that

02:40:41.298 --> 02:40:42.165
the key to early intervention.

02:40:42.232 --> 02:40:44.501
Is to recognize quickly the

02:40:44.568 --> 02:40:47.204
people who become homeless and

02:40:47.270 --> 02:40:48.271
to have a flexible array of

02:40:48.338 --> 02:40:48.905
services and support. There are

02:40:48.972 --> 02:40:52.409
I'm they'll- yet. Stand in

02:40:52.476 --> 02:40:54.711
space rapid housing. And

02:40:54.778 --> 02:40:56.646
housing for spaces which is a

02:40:56.713 --> 02:40:59.816
care package of benefits which

02:40:59.883 --> 02:41:03.687
has time limit to subsidies

02:41:03.754 --> 02:41:04.287
assistance of moving costs and

02:41:04.354 --> 02:41:06.857
this is meant to stabilize sold.

02:41:06.923 --> 02:41:08.291
And then you've heard about the

02:41:08.358 --> 02:41:12.529
enormous success of the loss in

02:41:12.596 --> 02:41:13.196
this flexible happen pool they

02:41:13.263 --> 02:41:17.134
have used these funds for a

02:41:17.200 --> 02:41:17.801
variety of purposes things like

02:41:17.868 --> 02:41:19.269
he said. Subsidies assistance

02:41:19.336 --> 02:41:22.973
with my an port woodland. Thank

02:41:23.040 --> 02:41:25.909
and special good. Eight eight.

02:41:25.976 --> 02:41:28.812
The key to sit seems to be an

02:41:28.879 --> 02:41:34.851
flexibility. The other critical

02:41:34.918 --> 02:41:35.452
area that you've heard about

02:41:35.519 --> 02:41:35.919
today is homelessness

02:41:35.986 --> 02:41:36.620
prevention but I want to say

02:41:36.686 --> 02:41:37.220
about that is that we know we

02:41:37.287 --> 02:41:38.388
the proper time getting to

02:41:38.455 --> 02:41:41.491
police. Salt from entry. The

02:41:41.558 --> 02:41:42.893
tree so in the for these

02:41:42.959 --> 02:41:44.428
interventions to be successful

02:41:44.494 --> 02:41:47.597
they have to be what we call

02:41:47.664 --> 02:41:48.165
effective and efficient so

02:41:48.231 --> 02:41:50.233
effective means they need to

02:41:50.300 --> 02:41:52.569
work and know what seems to

02:41:52.636 --> 02:41:54.371
work this is mostly from NY and

02:41:54.438 --> 02:41:56.740
research out of New York is a

02:41:56.807 --> 02:41:59.676
kind of flexible cage that

02:41:59.743 --> 02:42:00.277
usually include some one time

02:42:00.343 --> 02:42:00.977
it's usually up to a- hundred

02:42:01.044 --> 02:42:02.579
dollars. Send pay back rent to

02:42:02.646 --> 02:42:05.115
pay utilities and then other

02:42:05.182 --> 02:42:07.484
services like legal services

02:42:07.551 --> 02:42:09.252
for eviction Chen land decent

02:42:09.319 --> 02:42:12.389
services and services increase

02:42:12.456 --> 02:42:15.025
income. Allen Chau would you

02:42:15.092 --> 02:42:17.727
rebel yet yeah. Our to get to

02:42:17.794 --> 02:42:19.229
you what's in quite for great

02:42:19.296 --> 02:42:19.830
just some in the nation and

02:42:19.896 --> 02:42:21.598
what we for the prevent

02:42:21.665 --> 02:42:23.667
targeting it to those at the

02:42:23.733 --> 02:42:27.070
highest risk and allowing for

02:42:27.137 --> 02:42:29.272
people to become homeless

02:42:29.339 --> 02:42:30.240
meaning that if you tell me

02:42:30.307 --> 02:42:30.774
that you're prevention pro

02:42:30.841 --> 02:42:31.842
Allen became. I'm gonna tell

02:42:31.908 --> 02:42:33.777
you you probably didn't target

02:42:33.844 --> 02:42:37.013
to people who are likely to

02:42:37.080 --> 02:42:37.614
become homeless anyway. Thank

02:42:37.681 --> 02:42:43.286
you. This amounts. Thank you so

02:42:43.353 --> 02:42:43.887
much good afternoon and thank

02:42:43.954 --> 02:42:44.721
you for the opportunity to

02:42:44.788 --> 02:42:47.124
share with you a day in the

02:42:47.190 --> 02:42:47.724
life of a service and housing

02:42:47.791 --> 02:42:49.292
provider in the bay area my

02:42:49.359 --> 02:42:51.695
name is Jamie I'm on Sunday

02:42:51.761 --> 02:42:54.030
executive director of bearing

02:42:54.097 --> 02:42:56.199
unity services our backs for

02:42:56.266 --> 02:42:57.968
short we have three hundred

02:42:58.034 --> 02:42:58.535
forty staff who I consider

02:42:58.602 --> 02:43:01.271
first responders in this work-

02:43:01.338 --> 02:43:03.707
to help the on shelter cried as

02:43:03.773 --> 02:43:06.109
an- backs. Thirty contract

02:43:06.176 --> 02:43:08.745
between cities counties and the

02:43:08.812 --> 02:43:10.881
state and feds. We know this

02:43:10.947 --> 02:43:13.884
crisis must have a regional

02:43:13.950 --> 02:43:16.052
approach and I promise I wrote

02:43:16.119 --> 02:43:16.653
this before all the regional

02:43:16.720 --> 02:43:18.321
questions so they will address

02:43:18.388 --> 02:43:20.123
some of them. And a

02:43:20.190 --> 02:43:22.893
collaborative approach. Two and

02:43:22.959 --> 02:43:25.428
in this problem community based

02:43:25.495 --> 02:43:26.630
organizations like back so my

02:43:26.696 --> 02:43:27.264
colleagues in the room such as

02:43:27.330 --> 02:43:28.732
St merry's abode swords to pop.

02:43:28.798 --> 02:43:32.068
We all spend. 50% of our

02:43:32.135 --> 02:43:33.937
organizational time navigating

02:43:34.004 --> 02:43:34.471
and braiding these funds

02:43:34.538 --> 02:43:36.206
together on behalf of all the

02:43:36.273 --> 02:43:38.708
government entities it is an

02:43:38.775 --> 02:43:43.146
utter waste of time that time

02:43:43.213 --> 02:43:43.780
could be doubled up double in

02:43:43.847 --> 02:43:46.783
the people we serve for backs

02:43:46.850 --> 02:43:51.655
about half of our resources

02:43:51.721 --> 02:43:52.322
from mental health and half of

02:43:52.389 --> 02:43:54.324
them come from homeless and

02:43:54.391 --> 02:43:55.325
resources. If we want to solve

02:43:55.392 --> 02:43:56.826
homelessness we need. I usually

02:43:56.893 --> 02:44:00.830
don't read my pages. Funds to

02:44:00.897 --> 02:44:04.501
be directed regionally right

02:44:04.568 --> 02:44:05.101
now we have a system that has

02:44:05.168 --> 02:44:09.306
done a services on. Room and on

02:44:09.372 --> 02:44:09.940
the other end that drought we

02:44:10.006 --> 02:44:11.474
really focus on permanent

02:44:11.541 --> 02:44:12.075
support of housing. What I've

02:44:12.142 --> 02:44:14.644
looked. Wider thing we do St

02:44:14.711 --> 02:44:16.680
out right now diners we

02:44:16.746 --> 02:44:18.348
administer the coordinated

02:44:18.415 --> 02:44:21.518
entry systems we housing

02:44:21.585 --> 02:44:22.953
locator services in case

02:44:23.019 --> 02:44:23.520
management we do permanent

02:44:23.587 --> 02:44:26.456
support of housing and then of

02:44:26.523 --> 02:44:27.090
course mental health services.

02:44:27.157 --> 02:44:29.459
I've learned it is it's the

02:44:29.526 --> 02:44:31.061
extreme it's the all or nothing

02:44:31.127 --> 02:44:31.595
so you know we're really

02:44:31.661 --> 02:44:33.897
focused on emergency services

02:44:33.964 --> 02:44:39.502
will tend to be about 1020% of

02:44:39.569 --> 02:44:40.170
the in house population need at

02:44:40.237 --> 02:44:42.038
a time. And then on the other

02:44:42.105 --> 02:44:45.542
hand of course PSH are. Out the

02:44:45.609 --> 02:44:47.510
people in the middle of the

02:44:47.577 --> 02:44:50.180
6280% of people in the middle

02:44:50.247 --> 02:44:53.083
that and in our experience just

02:44:53.149 --> 02:44:55.118
tend not to get anything

02:44:55.185 --> 02:44:57.287
because of the way we've laid

02:44:57.354 --> 02:44:58.989
out the system and many. They

02:44:59.055 --> 02:45:01.157
really don't solve the problem

02:45:01.224 --> 02:45:04.227
back says turned into this the

02:45:04.294 --> 02:45:07.264
population three strategies

02:45:07.330 --> 02:45:07.897
that demand there is permanent

02:45:07.964 --> 02:45:12.035
housing resources tied to each

02:45:12.102 --> 02:45:12.636
navigation bad. Like what

02:45:12.702 --> 02:45:14.971
autumn I'm we've bought own

02:45:15.038 --> 02:45:21.645
family home. As a permanent

02:45:21.711 --> 02:45:24.080
today and the city of Oakland

02:45:24.147 --> 02:45:24.681
we house five hundred fifteen

02:45:24.748 --> 02:45:28.852
homeless seniors in Oakland and

02:45:28.918 --> 02:45:30.587
a record time of seven months-

02:45:30.654 --> 02:45:31.221
so it really goes to show that

02:45:31.288 --> 02:45:33.790
there is availability out

02:45:33.857 --> 02:45:38.495
there. We basically tested a

02:45:38.561 --> 02:45:39.129
model of rather than on rights

02:45:39.195 --> 02:45:40.797
that need space so one the

02:45:40.864 --> 02:45:44.634
things. Has now models help. Us

02:45:44.701 --> 02:45:48.672
okay nine months done people

02:45:48.738 --> 02:45:50.674
don't were that way some need a

02:45:50.740 --> 02:45:51.274
you or so people in the three

02:45:51.341 --> 02:45:53.810
some need. For years of two one

02:45:53.877 --> 02:45:56.913
Bucks some as a so we have now

02:45:56.980 --> 02:45:58.481
to a of that. We need to design

02:45:58.548 --> 02:46:01.117
model to under the true needs

02:46:01.184 --> 02:46:02.919
of the person in front of us I

02:46:02.986 --> 02:46:05.188
think we've learned that US.

02:46:05.255 --> 02:46:07.524
This they are what. Group goes

02:46:07.590 --> 02:46:10.894
to which of P. as I wrap up we

02:46:10.960 --> 02:46:13.663
of them. Is really a- region as

02:46:13.730 --> 02:46:15.965
run subsidies. When you really

02:46:16.032 --> 02:46:16.499
talk about the- question I

02:46:16.566 --> 02:46:18.601
think it's such a c<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;. My ex.&lt;/c&gt;</u>

02:46:18.668 --> 02:46:22.439
In two city Okla and Berkeley.

02:46:22.505 --> 02:46:24.507
It really and- all jump over

02:46:24.574 --> 02:46:25.375
that city line and we have to

02:46:25.442 --> 02:46:29.179
re Roger. Them to down that.

02:46:29.245 --> 02:46:32.449
Killer city store. Shows I

02:46:32.515 --> 02:46:35.285
think that's where the real

02:46:35.352 --> 02:46:38.321
kind of in effect desk calls us

02:46:38.388 --> 02:46:41.825
in older. And certainly was the

02:46:41.891 --> 02:46:43.793
client and directions. Brown's

02:46:43.860 --> 02:46:45.562
I'm think about each on per

02:46:45.628 --> 02:46:47.297
needs some time of. Brown's

02:46:47.364 --> 02:46:53.503
support we an in. Of my health.

02:46:53.570 --> 02:46:54.137
Management serve how how's case

02:46:54.204 --> 02:46:55.004
management we have come of up.

02:46:55.071 --> 02:46:58.041
Of say okay this per and this.

02:46:58.108 --> 02:47:00.009
So we to do a better job of

02:47:00.076 --> 02:47:06.916
coordinating coordinating that.

02:47:06.983 --> 02:47:10.920
Can we use made an entry we-

02:47:10.987 --> 02:47:12.822
invested as a state and nay.

02:47:12.889 --> 02:47:15.325
And the- entry so I know the

02:47:15.392 --> 02:47:17.160
pet for. In where it and I know

02:47:17.227 --> 02:47:18.895
where it it's has stray. I'm

02:47:18.962 --> 02:47:21.297
but I think need to re look at

02:47:21.364 --> 02:47:21.931
that hard and fast as we can.

02:47:21.998 --> 02:47:25.835
To have these. Come down. And

02:47:25.902 --> 02:47:28.271
the other thing I'll say is you

02:47:28.338 --> 02:47:28.838
know we I I've time to many

02:47:28.905 --> 02:47:29.739
people. There to stay out.

02:47:29.806 --> 02:47:31.408
While they for voucher. So

02:47:31.474 --> 02:47:33.610
they'll say I'm stay outside

02:47:33.676 --> 02:47:35.278
for a years my fine comes up

02:47:35.345 --> 02:47:36.913
the such eight voucher. That

02:47:36.980 --> 02:47:38.982
shows us those golden ticket

02:47:39.048 --> 02:47:42.819
system. Design has been flawed

02:47:42.886 --> 02:47:43.420
and what we to do. Is really

02:47:43.486 --> 02:47:45.488
get re. To that sixty per that

02:47:45.555 --> 02:47:47.223
I talked about and then the

02:47:47.290 --> 02:47:49.125
last thing I'll say in terms of

02:47:49.192 --> 02:47:49.759
the challenges to a community

02:47:49.826 --> 02:47:51.261
based organization on the

02:47:51.327 --> 02:47:52.996
mental health side I think

02:47:53.062 --> 02:47:53.563
there are some really good

02:47:53.630 --> 02:47:56.800
questions. 50% of our staff

02:47:56.866 --> 02:47:59.436
time is to satisfying cal

02:47:59.502 --> 02:48:01.771
documentation dictated by rules

02:48:01.838 --> 02:48:03.106
from the state of California.

02:48:03.173 --> 02:48:05.642
That can be reduced to make.

02:48:05.708 --> 02:48:09.078
Percent I cannot describe more

02:48:09.145 --> 02:48:11.414
than saying every progress note

02:48:11.481 --> 02:48:13.183
house to be scrutinized in

02:48:13.249 --> 02:48:15.285
trouble read and before we're

02:48:15.351 --> 02:48:15.785
sure that we'll get that

02:48:15.852 --> 02:48:17.654
payment. That could than double

02:48:17.720 --> 02:48:20.990
the population- so I think so

02:48:21.057 --> 02:48:22.826
state rough. And of. Lost

02:48:22.892 --> 02:48:25.261
reform mental health housing.

02:48:25.328 --> 02:48:26.896
Would really. Bring double

02:48:26.963 --> 02:48:29.766
resource to the streets and I'm

02:48:29.833 --> 02:48:32.335
finally I am a firm believer of

02:48:32.402 --> 02:48:36.439
the regional subsidy pool. Idea

02:48:36.506 --> 02:48:37.807
yeah I think we've seen that

02:48:37.874 --> 02:48:41.377
were done it ourselves we have

02:48:41.444 --> 02:48:43.646
artificial. Than up market run

02:48:43.713 --> 02:48:45.682
to rate speak as right now in

02:48:45.748 --> 02:48:48.017
our- they may be tener twelve

02:48:48.084 --> 02:48:50.920
fifteen us. After that same way

02:48:50.987 --> 02:48:58.795
I'm. Lamb or got release the

02:48:58.862 --> 02:49:02.232
first. Also back leukemia Bucks

02:49:02.298 --> 02:49:04.234
a month though this age. That

02:49:04.300 --> 02:49:06.102
where regional approach to

02:49:06.169 --> 02:49:08.872
flexible so pool is real about

02:49:08.938 --> 02:49:10.139
to real create. And then she

02:49:10.206 --> 02:49:12.208
that the runs the rental does.

02:49:12.275 --> 02:49:14.477
Out of go because the home up

02:49:14.544 --> 02:49:17.814
and that were an and so just in

02:49:17.881 --> 02:49:19.682
summer provide. Cry serve.

02:49:19.749 --> 02:49:21.784
Rental subsidy that are new bay

02:49:21.851 --> 02:49:23.786
based on the person math with

02:49:23.853 --> 02:49:27.056
rap. Sir PSH for the 20% of are

02:49:27.123 --> 02:49:29.158
so people needed. Let's stop

02:49:29.225 --> 02:49:32.996
system of. PS of the in. Thank

02:49:33.062 --> 02:49:37.133
you for much thank you we're

02:49:37.200 --> 02:49:37.700
gonna open up to pay I know

02:49:37.767 --> 02:49:39.168
miss because it. Is here to a

02:49:39.235 --> 02:49:41.004
any question that we- we're

02:49:41.070 --> 02:49:43.006
mayor Brough. Comments open it

02:49:43.072 --> 02:49:48.811
to the committee for quite.

02:49:48.878 --> 02:49:59.522
This for. So all. But what are

02:49:59.589 --> 02:50:02.859
the key gaps that a way to

02:50:02.926 --> 02:50:05.295
prioritize. What would make a

02:50:05.361 --> 02:50:06.963
significant difference in

02:50:07.030 --> 02:50:09.432
making the process work better

02:50:09.499 --> 02:50:10.099
other choke points that we need

02:50:10.166 --> 02:50:12.402
to address- and I've I've my

02:50:12.468 --> 02:50:14.237
personal view is that at least

02:50:14.304 --> 02:50:15.738
in my community we spend so

02:50:15.805 --> 02:50:18.474
much attention on shelter. That

02:50:18.541 --> 02:50:20.877
we don't and that's the most

02:50:20.944 --> 02:50:21.477
controversial clearly a where

02:50:21.544 --> 02:50:23.546
you put them- as as you

02:50:23.613 --> 02:50:25.782
indicated in Los Angeles

02:50:25.848 --> 02:50:28.217
however the same argument we

02:50:28.284 --> 02:50:28.818
have the same situation I'm in

02:50:28.885 --> 02:50:31.154
Kern. But but- king at the-

02:50:31.220 --> 02:50:32.455
holistic. What what are the key

02:50:32.522 --> 02:50:32.956
gaps that we need to be

02:50:33.022 --> 02:50:38.394
addressing. I can start I think

02:50:38.461 --> 02:50:41.497
he what we've realize is that a

02:50:41.564 --> 02:50:43.433
large bloated group and then

02:50:43.499 --> 02:50:44.567
that all are not being touched

02:50:44.634 --> 02:50:47.170
anything Margo's. Sentiments

02:50:47.236 --> 02:50:50.206
were saying so that the us in

02:50:50.273 --> 02:50:54.877
our community 6% of people are

02:50:54.944 --> 02:50:55.445
getting permanent supportive

02:50:55.511 --> 02:50:55.979
housing in about twenty

02:50:56.045 --> 02:50:56.512
fifteen. That need it. And

02:50:56.579 --> 02:50:58.948
there's the shelter emergency

02:50:59.015 --> 02:50:59.582
system where spending a lot of

02:50:59.649 --> 02:51:02.251
focus which is of course- stand

02:51:02.318 --> 02:51:04.887
a bill in terms of a sister. I

02:51:04.954 --> 02:51:10.126
know who the 6280% are I do

02:51:10.193 --> 02:51:10.660
their coordinator entreat

02:51:10.727 --> 02:51:12.228
assessments- I know where they

02:51:12.295 --> 02:51:16.232
school are in the world. And

02:51:16.299 --> 02:51:20.536
all I have for the is. Eight

02:51:20.603 --> 02:51:22.872
check back later on. Maybe is

02:51:22.939 --> 02:51:23.606
very basic Robert house is very

02:51:23.673 --> 02:51:27.176
prescribe on may be. Last month

02:51:27.243 --> 02:51:27.777
deposit and if you find your

02:51:27.844 --> 02:51:29.545
own place we help you get into

02:51:29.612 --> 02:51:31.981
an city does individuals are

02:51:32.048 --> 02:51:32.649
says but don't meet the

02:51:32.715 --> 02:51:34.917
requirement to that they're not

02:51:34.984 --> 02:51:37.186
severe enough in sit in that

02:51:37.253 --> 02:51:38.988
sit in their situation to be

02:51:39.055 --> 02:51:40.456
and that's the irony person

02:51:40.523 --> 02:51:43.393
number for us in just

02:51:43.459 --> 02:51:44.994
experienced person number four

02:51:45.061 --> 02:51:45.561
thousand on the list to me

02:51:45.628 --> 02:51:47.897
looks like person number two

02:51:47.964 --> 02:51:50.066
hundred on the last and swear

02:51:50.133 --> 02:51:52.335
on the margin. Right exactly so

02:51:52.402 --> 02:51:55.772
it's really directing like that

02:51:55.838 --> 02:51:56.906
whether it's a rental subsidy

02:51:56.973 --> 02:51:57.507
pulling case management those

02:51:57.573 --> 02:52:01.711
are the two interventions to

02:52:01.778 --> 02:52:02.345
the to that. Son without having

02:52:02.412 --> 02:52:04.580
to. Wait I would say so is that

02:52:04.647 --> 02:52:06.382
as a resource to you or is that

02:52:06.449 --> 02:52:08.951
a process it was a both. I

02:52:09.018 --> 02:52:09.552
think it's I think it's both

02:52:09.619 --> 02:52:13.056
the ads directing resources and

02:52:13.122 --> 02:52:15.591
it's- eliminating some of the

02:52:15.658 --> 02:52:18.094
policies that don't allow us to

02:52:18.161 --> 02:52:20.963
serve the person in front of

02:52:21.030 --> 02:52:24.934
us- based on just how the

02:52:25.001 --> 02:52:25.468
policy. Works that. Yeah I

02:52:25.535 --> 02:52:27.303
don't think anyone. I don't

02:52:27.370 --> 02:52:29.605
think anyone would argue for

02:52:29.672 --> 02:52:30.239
not investing in permits part

02:52:30.306 --> 02:52:32.875
of housing for those most

02:52:32.942 --> 02:52:35.611
disabled it's just that if you

02:52:35.678 --> 02:52:36.179
haven't been how much. Time

02:52:36.245 --> 02:52:36.779
meet those criteria. In many

02:52:36.846 --> 02:52:39.282
parts this we offer very low.

02:52:39.348 --> 02:52:39.882
And they may be able to be.

02:52:39.949 --> 02:52:41.984
Much less and if they're not

02:52:42.051 --> 02:52:43.720
they're gonna stay out there

02:52:43.786 --> 02:52:44.320
for a long time and suffer a

02:52:44.387 --> 02:52:46.723
lot so is there is there enough

02:52:46.789 --> 02:52:49.125
service for that 60% or we

02:52:49.192 --> 02:52:51.394
just. Is it apart it made or do

02:52:51.461 --> 02:52:53.930
we need to expand that capacity

02:52:53.996 --> 02:52:58.167
or do we have it. Or is that

02:52:58.234 --> 02:52:58.768
capacity there and we're just

02:52:58.835 --> 02:53:00.436
we just that case management

02:53:00.503 --> 02:53:05.274
with lack. Right I think it is

02:53:05.341 --> 02:53:05.842
a resource that you when you

02:53:05.908 --> 02:53:06.509
have an interest to prior as to

02:53:06.576 --> 02:53:08.277
where the greatest need as and

02:53:08.344 --> 02:53:10.379
so you have a Cutie high need

02:53:10.446 --> 02:53:12.815
population on the street need

02:53:12.882 --> 02:53:13.349
part of housing that we is

02:53:13.416 --> 02:53:15.718
that's why we- are issuing.

02:53:15.785 --> 02:53:18.921
Proposition HHH bonds to

02:53:18.988 --> 02:53:21.557
develop. Sufficient support of

02:53:21.624 --> 02:53:23.993
housing then you have a large

02:53:24.060 --> 02:53:24.594
and population on the street

02:53:24.660 --> 02:53:26.462
that are trying to find

02:53:26.529 --> 02:53:27.063
resources for those immediate

02:53:27.130 --> 02:53:29.499
needs is a huge gap from the

02:53:29.565 --> 02:53:33.369
city of LA- and so you're

02:53:33.436 --> 02:53:35.738
looking at it I'm housing and

02:53:35.805 --> 02:53:36.539
the folks in the middle. The

02:53:36.606 --> 02:53:40.777
ones that have very tight that

02:53:40.843 --> 02:53:41.410
means that they're not the your

02:53:41.477 --> 02:53:42.011
prior to increase. Both those

02:53:42.078 --> 02:53:45.081
and- patient level resources to

02:53:45.148 --> 02:53:47.517
get at the people who may not

02:53:47.583 --> 02:53:48.951
have the most immediate needs

02:53:49.018 --> 02:53:51.420
but are developing them every

02:53:51.487 --> 02:53:52.021
day like they will eventually

02:53:52.088 --> 02:53:53.956
become. You they will go up

02:53:54.023 --> 02:53:56.759
that list and they will qualify

02:53:56.826 --> 02:53:58.795
for support housing. Is just to

02:53:58.861 --> 02:53:59.328
be clear that the then the

02:53:59.395 --> 02:54:01.230
solution is what. More

02:54:01.297 --> 02:54:02.799
research. Resources shocking

02:54:02.865 --> 02:54:04.333
okay to mention that Lake

02:54:04.400 --> 02:54:07.136
County there's thousand people

02:54:07.203 --> 02:54:09.539
with ulcers and- no place to go

02:54:09.605 --> 02:54:13.176
yeah. So the source issue as

02:54:13.242 --> 02:54:15.678
far as- the lack of affordable

02:54:15.745 --> 02:54:18.748
housing. And so if it so we

02:54:18.815 --> 02:54:20.316
have the thing available or

02:54:20.383 --> 02:54:20.817
advocate job and for the

02:54:20.883 --> 02:54:22.251
housing chair but is there that

02:54:22.318 --> 02:54:25.388
is the housing there is that

02:54:25.454 --> 02:54:25.922
the support housing there

02:54:25.988 --> 02:54:27.390
that's part of the resources

02:54:27.456 --> 02:54:29.292
that are needed we have we have

02:54:29.358 --> 02:54:30.693
a housing affordability crisis

02:54:30.760 --> 02:54:31.727
there's- issues we don't have

02:54:31.794 --> 02:54:35.364
enough inventory and so rents

02:54:35.431 --> 02:54:35.998
are rising we don't have enough

02:54:36.065 --> 02:54:37.533
controls on rents I think. Is a

02:54:37.600 --> 02:54:40.102
big part of it that housing is

02:54:40.169 --> 02:54:40.770
getting developed in the proper.

02:54:40.837 --> 02:54:42.605
Hi so that we rephrase my

02:54:42.672 --> 02:54:43.739
question that if you were given

02:54:43.806 --> 02:54:45.141
the resources what did you do.

02:54:45.208 --> 02:54:46.609
To address 6080% if it's if

02:54:46.676 --> 02:54:48.110
it's just if it the key is

02:54:48.177 --> 02:54:48.711
resources what would you and-

02:54:48.778 --> 02:54:50.847
sit down. With the strategy be.

02:54:50.913 --> 02:54:52.281
I think that there is a

02:54:52.348 --> 02:54:53.983
combination of investing in

02:54:54.050 --> 02:54:56.118
affordable units that are just

02:54:56.185 --> 02:54:56.752
affordable that don't require.

02:54:56.819 --> 02:54:58.788
That on going subsidy as a

02:54:58.855 --> 02:55:01.257
capital investment is

02:55:01.324 --> 02:55:03.459
sufficient to. Just support a

02:55:03.526 --> 02:55:04.527
lower rental rates so that

02:55:04.594 --> 02:55:07.029
people who. Could it could pay

02:55:07.096 --> 02:55:07.563
or rents in Florence were

02:55:07.630 --> 02:55:09.732
available to them. We have more

02:55:09.799 --> 02:55:11.400
unit. I do think there are

02:55:11.467 --> 02:55:12.969
other policy related solutions

02:55:13.035 --> 02:55:14.637
that have been- is starting to

02:55:14.704 --> 02:55:16.606
be developed around where we

02:55:16.672 --> 02:55:20.576
have- fourteen eighty two that

02:55:20.643 --> 02:55:22.612
it will it will be. Hopefully

02:55:22.678 --> 02:55:25.414
putting some. Restrictions on

02:55:25.481 --> 02:55:28.050
on rising rents for people who

02:55:28.117 --> 02:55:28.651
would then would not be losing

02:55:28.718 --> 02:55:31.387
their housing in the first

02:55:31.454 --> 02:55:33.689
place. But also- the city of LA

02:55:33.756 --> 02:55:38.761
we've established. Other hello.

02:55:38.828 --> 02:55:41.130
My Dorian can where for a

02:55:41.197 --> 02:55:41.764
exchange for dance and projects

02:55:41.831 --> 02:55:44.400
that are along those- state to

02:55:44.467 --> 02:55:50.039
find hi transit areas where

02:55:50.106 --> 02:55:53.142
they're getting big change for

02:55:53.209 --> 02:55:53.743
that lower debt that higher

02:55:53.809 --> 02:55:55.711
density that we are getting

02:55:55.778 --> 02:55:56.846
affordable units covenanted

02:55:56.913 --> 02:56:00.416
affordable you thanks James so

02:56:00.483 --> 02:56:01.050
I think that it's a combination

02:56:01.117 --> 02:56:03.586
more of a housing policy

02:56:03.653 --> 02:56:04.987
conversation that needs to be

02:56:05.054 --> 02:56:06.722
and also for those folks that

02:56:06.789 --> 02:56:08.024
are in the middle to be able to

02:56:08.090 --> 02:56:09.959
act. Even maybe even as with

02:56:10.026 --> 02:56:12.194
subsidies. Things are are very

02:56:12.261 --> 02:56:14.730
limited that's why you do see

02:56:14.797 --> 02:56:16.465
people at the section eight

02:56:16.532 --> 02:56:19.635
voucher who time out and are

02:56:19.702 --> 02:56:22.371
not able to find a unit in a to

02:56:22.438 --> 02:56:24.273
use that voucher and in the

02:56:24.340 --> 02:56:27.143
amount of time you have to use

02:56:27.209 --> 02:56:29.845
it we have and a big problem

02:56:29.912 --> 02:56:30.479
with our overall housing market

02:56:30.546 --> 02:56:35.117
and that's it. Another access

02:56:35.184 --> 02:56:36.585
with. Finding units in the

02:56:36.652 --> 02:56:39.155
private market I do think it's

02:56:39.221 --> 02:56:39.789
getting harder and harder all

02:56:39.855 --> 02:56:41.157
the time because that even that

02:56:41.223 --> 02:56:43.426
supply or tapping out. And my

02:56:43.492 --> 02:56:45.661
this guess last question if I

02:56:45.728 --> 02:56:46.996
could address into you didn't I

02:56:47.063 --> 02:56:48.197
wrote that you said that the

02:56:48.264 --> 02:56:48.864
percent of time goes to medical

02:56:48.931 --> 02:56:53.069
paperwork. And if we could.

02:56:53.135 --> 02:56:55.237
Warm that and reduce it 210%

02:56:55.304 --> 02:56:58.507
so. When you flush it out for

02:56:58.574 --> 02:56:59.041
me in terms of when that

02:56:59.108 --> 02:57:01.177
process is and how would. We

02:57:01.243 --> 02:57:02.244
streamlined that how long do

02:57:02.311 --> 02:57:06.315
you have. You know I. As long

02:57:06.382 --> 02:57:06.882
as that is he'll he'll give

02:57:06.949 --> 02:57:08.718
there's local groups- at least

02:57:08.784 --> 02:57:10.252
in the bay and I'm sure this is

02:57:10.319 --> 02:57:14.056
a state wide that have analyze

02:57:14.123 --> 02:57:16.125
the regulation and the state

02:57:16.192 --> 02:57:16.659
department of health care

02:57:16.726 --> 02:57:17.960
services medi cal regulations

02:57:18.027 --> 02:57:20.363
on the over reaching in and

02:57:20.429 --> 02:57:24.467
Berman some documentation that-

02:57:24.533 --> 02:57:26.035
very specific like right now as

02:57:26.102 --> 02:57:28.471
an example- staff person has to

02:57:28.537 --> 02:57:30.339
write a personal by the minute

02:57:30.406 --> 02:57:32.408
of service if I go out and I'm

02:57:32.475 --> 02:57:34.110
working with someone that's

02:57:34.176 --> 02:57:36.178
homeless currency mental health

02:57:36.245 --> 02:57:37.980
so stop symptoms. And I do a

02:57:38.047 --> 02:57:40.182
fourteen minute conversation I

02:57:40.249 --> 02:57:42.451
have to write. Top of page note

02:57:42.518 --> 02:57:44.286
that talks through it all for

02:57:44.353 --> 02:57:46.756
that fourteen minutes if I want

02:57:46.822 --> 02:57:48.657
to be sure that it won't get

02:57:48.724 --> 02:57:50.226
disallowed and so that. SO

02:57:50.292 --> 02:57:52.361
literally our staff 50% of

02:57:52.428 --> 02:57:54.096
their time is documentation 50%

02:57:54.163 --> 02:57:56.399
is no writing or and you know

02:57:56.465 --> 02:57:58.067
you that's the constant dancing

02:57:58.134 --> 02:58:00.236
games so I'd be happy to offer

02:58:00.302 --> 02:58:00.836
like all those. Certainly who

02:58:00.903 --> 02:58:02.571
would like to look at me so

02:58:02.638 --> 02:58:04.340
it's actual paper at youth fax

02:58:04.407 --> 02:58:07.943
over to or is it dead on. That

02:58:08.010 --> 02:58:10.679
documentation of this service

02:58:10.746 --> 02:58:11.313
to then render the bill into

02:58:11.380 --> 02:58:14.683
than get paid. Okay so it up

02:58:14.750 --> 02:58:16.185
said H. M. and some ways he if

02:58:16.252 --> 02:58:19.088
you get the lower to like one

02:58:19.155 --> 02:58:21.390
page or a monthly it says a

02:58:21.457 --> 02:58:24.126
sentence yeah verses a page

02:58:24.193 --> 02:58:24.560
literally staff para

02:58:24.627 --> 02:58:25.161
professionals all the way up

02:58:25.227 --> 02:58:28.164
to. The clinicians have right

02:58:28.230 --> 02:58:30.032
you know a substantial note to

02:58:30.099 --> 02:58:32.034
get paid for that okay why Sir

02:58:32.101 --> 02:58:32.601
I certainly want to explore

02:58:32.668 --> 02:58:34.470
that I want to get too much.

02:58:34.537 --> 02:58:38.707
Thanks very much thank you. So

02:58:38.774 --> 02:58:40.543
I have a- question that's

02:58:40.609 --> 02:58:42.445
specific because to the issue

02:58:42.511 --> 02:58:48.350
of- how well we are- actually

02:58:48.417 --> 02:58:50.519
collaborating on a regional

02:58:50.586 --> 02:58:52.321
basis and whether or not

02:58:52.388 --> 02:58:54.390
there's room for improvement-

02:58:54.457 --> 02:58:58.060
and the question relates to-

02:58:58.127 --> 02:59:00.196
cities that are nine he

02:59:00.262 --> 02:59:02.465
eligible this I think is most

02:59:02.531 --> 02:59:06.469
relevant to the- county of LA

02:59:06.535 --> 02:59:08.804
but it- in the first. In the

02:59:08.871 --> 02:59:10.639
proposed funding allocation- is

02:59:10.706 --> 02:59:13.309
there room for non heap

02:59:13.375 --> 02:59:15.978
eligible cities to receive

02:59:16.045 --> 02:59:18.647
funding because we have an on

02:59:18.714 --> 02:59:19.281
going issue in the city and a

02:59:19.348 --> 02:59:22.418
Monica where- they're not.

02:59:22.485 --> 02:59:25.955
Receiving funding for a program

02:59:26.021 --> 02:59:28.290
that has demonstrated multi

02:59:28.357 --> 02:59:30.259
disciplinary team program that

02:59:30.326 --> 02:59:32.261
has demonstrated positive

02:59:32.328 --> 02:59:34.697
results- in the going to have

02:59:34.763 --> 02:59:38.567
to- and that program in June if

02:59:38.634 --> 02:59:42.338
they don't receive funding. The

02:59:42.404 --> 02:59:44.206
perhaps Mister Ramirez you

02:59:44.273 --> 02:59:46.142
might surpass thanks to answer

02:59:46.208 --> 02:59:46.775
that well I mean we don't love

02:59:46.842 --> 02:59:48.577
you you mentioned he funding

02:59:48.644 --> 02:59:50.546
right- I think that's where the

02:59:50.613 --> 02:59:54.617
well I mean I think- frankly

02:59:54.683 --> 02:59:55.251
the jurisdiction is looking for

02:59:55.317 --> 02:59:58.787
any possible Avenue to continue

02:59:58.854 --> 03:00:02.291
this program yeah eight. Yeah

03:00:02.358 --> 03:00:04.860
turn down there applique. I'm

03:00:04.927 --> 03:00:08.330
not aware I to push on this no

03:00:08.397 --> 03:00:09.532
no worries I'm not a familiar

03:00:09.598 --> 03:00:11.934
with the application that was

03:00:12.001 --> 03:00:12.468
private that's one of our

03:00:12.535 --> 03:00:16.472
challenges in LA county is that.

03:00:16.539 --> 03:00:19.208
You know there's eighty seven

03:00:19.275 --> 03:00:19.875
other cities besides. City well.

03:00:19.942 --> 03:00:20.976
Yeah Palm Beach Pasadena

03:00:21.043 --> 03:00:23.546
Glendale are their own

03:00:23.612 --> 03:00:24.180
consumers can of care so they

03:00:24.246 --> 03:00:26.549
do get funding but for the

03:00:26.615 --> 03:00:29.051
other cities- that's been our

03:00:29.118 --> 03:00:35.524
biggest challenge we invest a

03:00:35.591 --> 03:00:36.192
lot of time trying to- get them

03:00:36.258 --> 03:00:37.793
as part. From our measure

03:00:37.860 --> 03:00:40.563
explains that I that I. On this.

03:00:40.629 --> 03:00:43.866
Of we provided cities the opera.

03:00:43.933 --> 03:00:45.100
Up apply for around fifteen

03:00:45.167 --> 03:00:47.236
million dollars worth of. No

03:00:47.303 --> 03:00:50.673
we're was. But I know it's not

03:00:50.739 --> 03:00:56.045
enough and the city's- you know

03:00:56.111 --> 03:00:59.882
a lot of them staff to even-

03:00:59.949 --> 03:01:01.417
fellow programs and several

03:01:01.483 --> 03:01:03.085
other cities believe do it the

03:01:03.152 --> 03:01:06.622
bill. There's no money I'm for

03:01:06.689 --> 03:01:08.657
you something cities to their

03:01:08.724 --> 03:01:10.593
own. But so projects like that

03:01:10.659 --> 03:01:11.126
or or programs that you

03:01:11.193 --> 03:01:13.262
mentioned up for you based on

03:01:13.329 --> 03:01:16.031
what you told me would probably

03:01:16.098 --> 03:01:20.302
would have. I'm qualified for

03:01:20.369 --> 03:01:20.936
whatever funding grants that we

03:01:21.003 --> 03:01:24.807
were providing cities- a couple

03:01:24.873 --> 03:01:27.176
years ago- dot funding and as I

03:01:27.243 --> 03:01:30.212
believe in the next come next

03:01:30.279 --> 03:01:30.846
coming fiscal year. Will be we

03:01:30.913 --> 03:01:34.250
will be looking at- musing more

03:01:34.316 --> 03:01:35.951
H. P. to provide additional

03:01:36.018 --> 03:01:38.554
funding to cities that are we

03:01:38.621 --> 03:01:39.188
are we getting funding but also

03:01:39.255 --> 03:01:42.591
on. These an regional council

03:01:42.658 --> 03:01:44.426
of governments with dean in the

03:01:44.493 --> 03:01:46.295
future so that pro innovative

03:01:46.362 --> 03:01:48.530
programs like this- that you

03:01:48.597 --> 03:01:50.399
mentioned- would get funded-

03:01:50.466 --> 03:01:52.468
either directly to the city or

03:01:52.534 --> 03:01:54.470
through a council of

03:01:54.536 --> 03:01:58.374
government- kind of- function.

03:01:58.440 --> 03:01:58.941
I'd be happy to talk to you

03:01:59.008 --> 03:02:02.478
more about this but hopefully-

03:02:02.544 --> 03:02:04.413
these the kind of issues that-

03:02:04.480 --> 03:02:04.980
can be resolved before the

03:02:05.047 --> 03:02:08.517
programs and- the folks who

03:02:08.584 --> 03:02:10.619
were responsible for carrying

03:02:10.686 --> 03:02:12.254
them out- go elsewhere and then

03:02:12.321 --> 03:02:14.290
starting it up against nearly

03:02:14.356 --> 03:02:17.726
impossible I will I will- get

03:02:17.793 --> 03:02:20.296
the message to my director who-

03:02:20.362 --> 03:02:23.932
very well. Cell so I will.

03:02:23.999 --> 03:02:28.070
Thank you. Mr person thank all

03:02:28.137 --> 03:02:30.406
panelists for your very concise

03:02:30.472 --> 03:02:31.707
presentations we could probably

03:02:31.774 --> 03:02:34.476
talk for hours on this the

03:02:34.543 --> 03:02:35.077
futures however questions of

03:02:35.144 --> 03:02:35.844
these are more request

03:02:35.911 --> 03:02:37.880
information but- from the

03:02:37.946 --> 03:02:40.149
geographic jurisdictions that

03:02:40.215 --> 03:02:41.817
were that are here I asked-

03:02:41.884 --> 03:02:44.019
both mayor shaft mayor Liccardo

03:02:44.086 --> 03:02:44.620
if you it has if they had a

03:02:44.687 --> 03:02:47.990
sense of a needs assessment and

03:02:48.057 --> 03:02:48.557
how much would it cost their

03:02:48.624 --> 03:02:49.858
their cities in the region's to

03:02:49.925 --> 03:02:51.493
address homelessness I know LA

03:02:51.560 --> 03:02:51.960
city and county you're

03:02:52.027 --> 03:02:53.829
suggesting a two billion

03:02:53.896 --> 03:02:55.764
dollar. Annual appropriation do

03:02:55.831 --> 03:02:58.000
you have a needs assessment and

03:02:58.067 --> 03:03:00.502
I'd love I know you're working

03:03:00.569 --> 03:03:01.136
on those numbers but we'd love

03:03:01.203 --> 03:03:02.071
is more of a request for

03:03:02.137 --> 03:03:02.705
information when you get those

03:03:02.771 --> 03:03:05.007
numbers love to get them yeah

03:03:05.074 --> 03:03:05.541
they also the same to San

03:03:05.607 --> 03:03:07.209
Francisco I have a sense of the

03:03:07.276 --> 03:03:10.145
numbers but love to get that we

03:03:10.212 --> 03:03:12.881
think we need more money spent

03:03:12.948 --> 03:03:14.350
just. Bye bye wondering where

03:03:14.416 --> 03:03:17.319
you are with your analysis.

03:03:17.386 --> 03:03:19.321
Assemblymember Chiu thanks for

03:03:19.388 --> 03:03:19.922
the question just wanted to

03:03:19.988 --> 03:03:23.892
point out that- the nine bay

03:03:23.959 --> 03:03:24.460
area counties are actually

03:03:24.526 --> 03:03:26.295
working to. Together under the

03:03:26.362 --> 03:03:26.829
leadership of a nonprofit

03:03:26.895 --> 03:03:30.099
called home base. To the things

03:03:30.165 --> 03:03:31.200
that we're doing is to. Being a

03:03:31.266 --> 03:03:31.800
systems map of all services

03:03:31.867 --> 03:03:34.536
available to people

03:03:34.603 --> 03:03:36.271
experiencing homelessness in

03:03:36.338 --> 03:03:36.805
that area will then used.

03:03:36.872 --> 03:03:37.339
Develop a gap analysis. To

03:03:37.406 --> 03:03:42.044
deter. Where there are. Someone

03:03:42.111 --> 03:03:42.578
much it would cost to fill

03:03:42.644 --> 03:03:43.178
those. We're also working to

03:03:43.245 --> 03:03:44.413
legal over each of my a systems

03:03:44.480 --> 03:03:45.748
together into one single

03:03:45.814 --> 03:03:47.716
system- so that were at least

03:03:47.783 --> 03:03:49.818
able to share information about

03:03:49.885 --> 03:03:50.419
people who are traveling from

03:03:50.486 --> 03:03:51.587
county to county seeking

03:03:51.653 --> 03:03:53.655
services. So some of this work

03:03:53.722 --> 03:03:55.858
is already in progress and a

03:03:55.924 --> 03:03:56.525
since I have the Mike also just

03:03:56.592 --> 03:03:57.693
wanted to point out that all

03:03:57.760 --> 03:03:59.661
echo- my colleagues and mayor

03:03:59.728 --> 03:04:02.431
shaft on the car does concerns

03:04:02.498 --> 03:04:04.166
about creating- another level

03:04:04.233 --> 03:04:06.268
of bureaucracy this regional

03:04:06.335 --> 03:04:06.769
administrator there is

03:04:06.835 --> 03:04:07.803
actually. A lot of work

03:04:07.870 --> 03:04:10.005
happening at the regional level

03:04:10.072 --> 03:04:11.907
I think this goods state. To

03:04:11.974 --> 03:04:14.510
take steps to mandate- and to

03:04:14.576 --> 03:04:15.144
take some leadership on budget

03:04:15.210 --> 03:04:16.845
having regional collaborations

03:04:16.912 --> 03:04:18.147
but I don't think adding

03:04:18.213 --> 03:04:19.915
another another layer into this

03:04:19.982 --> 03:04:21.717
funding is a particularly good

03:04:21.784 --> 03:04:22.284
idea. Because a lot of work

03:04:22.351 --> 03:04:25.387
actually already happening. I

03:04:25.454 --> 03:04:27.790
would just on that point or- of

03:04:27.856 --> 03:04:28.390
benefits. Thank missed amounts

03:04:28.457 --> 03:04:30.125
to you it also suggested there.

03:04:30.192 --> 03:04:31.527
There are definitely some

03:04:31.593 --> 03:04:34.029
benefits to regional work but

03:04:34.096 --> 03:04:34.696
it seems. You know the issue of

03:04:34.763 --> 03:04:35.731
whether we need an entire layer

03:04:35.798 --> 03:04:40.235
of a regional bureaucracy. I

03:04:40.302 --> 03:04:42.838
think is a very open question

03:04:42.905 --> 03:04:43.705
for us in the legislature so.

03:04:43.772 --> 03:04:45.741
Would love protect the after

03:04:45.808 --> 03:04:47.242
this here if you want to email

03:04:47.309 --> 03:04:49.812
us. We are you think. What you

03:04:49.878 --> 03:04:52.314
think we need to do to make

03:04:52.381 --> 03:04:52.815
sure that the regional

03:04:52.881 --> 03:04:54.016
conversations are happening-

03:04:54.082 --> 03:04:58.253
and if not a- regional entity

03:04:58.320 --> 03:04:59.621
managing that. How else should

03:04:59.688 --> 03:05:01.723
we structure to ensure those

03:05:01.790 --> 03:05:02.257
conversations occur. I'm

03:05:02.324 --> 03:05:03.892
totally deaf conversation.

03:05:03.959 --> 03:05:05.928
About silos. We know it's one

03:05:05.994 --> 03:05:08.096
it's easy to kind of focus on.

03:05:08.163 --> 03:05:09.965
Homelessness as it happens but

03:05:10.032 --> 03:05:11.733
there are many other systems

03:05:11.800 --> 03:05:13.502
are healthcare system. Our

03:05:13.569 --> 03:05:14.069
control justice system our

03:05:14.136 --> 03:05:15.737
education system our foster

03:05:15.804 --> 03:05:18.774
care system. Where breakdowns

03:05:18.841 --> 03:05:20.809
those systems are leading

03:05:20.876 --> 03:05:22.945
Thomas as- we also know there

03:05:23.011 --> 03:05:25.481
expenditures a monies in those.

03:05:25.547 --> 03:05:26.048
Their policy renew. That if

03:05:26.114 --> 03:05:28.283
they were better spent could

03:05:28.350 --> 03:05:28.884
help reduce homelessness. One

03:05:28.951 --> 03:05:29.918
in. If you of advice to us on

03:05:29.985 --> 03:05:32.187
how do we and sent. Other

03:05:32.254 --> 03:05:34.923
systems outside of the housing

03:05:34.990 --> 03:05:36.992
and homelessness system. To

03:05:37.059 --> 03:05:39.461
incent these other policy

03:05:39.528 --> 03:05:42.130
Salas. Work better with those

03:05:42.197 --> 03:05:44.466
of you. On the front lines of

03:05:44.533 --> 03:05:46.335
addressing homelessness. To do

03:05:46.401 --> 03:05:49.004
this is it I passed a bill

03:05:49.071 --> 03:05:49.605
couple years ago the governor

03:05:49.671 --> 03:05:52.908
brown side- push the

03:05:52.975 --> 03:05:53.442
conversation Harper met a

03:05:53.509 --> 03:06:03.952
chronically- clinically was.

03:06:04.019 --> 03:06:04.486
Six seven eight different

03:06:04.553 --> 03:06:08.023
policy us. I can sure just a

03:06:08.090 --> 03:06:09.725
little I think the cross

03:06:09.791 --> 03:06:11.927
systems approaches what I also

03:06:11.994 --> 03:06:13.595
call regionalization so I it

03:06:13.662 --> 03:06:16.031
backs our organization has a

03:06:16.098 --> 03:06:17.799
contract with the probation

03:06:17.866 --> 03:06:20.202
department for maybe a half a

03:06:20.269 --> 03:06:22.004
million dollars to use that as

03:06:22.070 --> 03:06:25.541
a flexible spending subsidy

03:06:25.607 --> 03:06:27.643
pull to house people on

03:06:27.709 --> 03:06:30.345
probation yeah so that's that

03:06:30.412 --> 03:06:32.548
was my kind of ultimate plane

03:06:32.614 --> 03:06:36.018
to is that set the silo we had

03:06:36.084 --> 03:06:37.619
that can be braided together so

03:06:37.686 --> 03:06:38.153
if you're looking at real

03:06:38.220 --> 03:06:39.855
supply. All kind of spending

03:06:39.922 --> 03:06:40.255
policy and I need

03:06:40.322 --> 03:06:42.491
regionalization based on the

03:06:42.558 --> 03:06:46.228
kind of intricacies of each Gen.

03:06:46.295 --> 03:06:48.130
I wouldn't have to say well let

03:06:48.196 --> 03:06:48.697
me check this box for this

03:06:48.764 --> 03:06:51.366
individual on a me to access

03:06:51.433 --> 03:06:54.169
this part of money for this.

03:06:54.236 --> 03:06:56.338
Effort and it would be just

03:06:56.405 --> 03:07:00.108
really- through policy

03:07:00.175 --> 03:07:01.343
requiring you know whether it's

03:07:01.410 --> 03:07:03.211
the criminal justice system the

03:07:03.278 --> 03:07:03.845
and I think there's I think the

03:07:03.912 --> 03:07:06.248
Senate to the well as here

03:07:06.315 --> 03:07:06.848
right now and we're all going

03:07:06.915 --> 03:07:08.517
towards the same goal but-

03:07:08.584 --> 03:07:12.588
where what it feels like in is

03:07:12.654 --> 03:07:13.188
on the streets right now is.

03:07:13.255 --> 03:07:14.022
There is you know the silos are

03:07:14.089 --> 03:07:15.524
alive and well and it's

03:07:15.591 --> 03:07:17.926
creating that the person in

03:07:17.993 --> 03:07:20.395
front us to jump through so

03:07:20.462 --> 03:07:21.763
many more hoops to house them

03:07:21.830 --> 03:07:23.999
and so. I am a large proponent

03:07:24.066 --> 03:07:24.566
of regionalization and will

03:07:24.633 --> 03:07:26.134
definitely email thoughts

03:07:26.201 --> 03:07:29.471
because I at least where I sit-

03:07:29.538 --> 03:07:31.873
we do not have regionalization

03:07:31.940 --> 03:07:33.575
we have great partnerships and

03:07:33.642 --> 03:07:35.911
relationships of talking to one

03:07:35.978 --> 03:07:36.545
another our cities and counties

03:07:36.612 --> 03:07:40.515
are amazing. Awesome and what

03:07:40.582 --> 03:07:41.717
if it what it is on the streets

03:07:41.783 --> 03:07:43.885
for us- we- do not have the

03:07:43.952 --> 03:07:45.721
regional approach. Any other

03:07:45.787 --> 03:07:47.723
comments on that so excuse me

03:07:47.789 --> 03:07:48.190
one second sorry I did

03:07:48.256 --> 03:07:51.760
apologize because I need to go

03:07:51.827 --> 03:07:52.394
I apologize for not be able to

03:07:52.461 --> 03:07:54.262
finish the remainder the

03:07:54.329 --> 03:07:54.863
hearing but Mister bloom is

03:07:54.930 --> 03:07:57.733
going to be- that turned the

03:07:57.799 --> 03:07:58.367
gavel over to Mr bloom and he's

03:07:58.433 --> 03:08:00.202
gonna finish. So appreciate

03:08:00.268 --> 03:08:02.070
that they at thank you again to

03:08:02.137 --> 03:08:02.671
all the- panelists for coming

03:08:02.738 --> 03:08:05.641
today. Up you for that and in

03:08:05.707 --> 03:08:07.609
and I very much would welcome

03:08:07.676 --> 03:08:08.210
any thoughts that you would

03:08:08.276 --> 03:08:10.512
have on. How do we and sent the

03:08:10.579 --> 03:08:12.414
breakdown of silos how do we

03:08:12.481 --> 03:08:14.650
had sent- the right

03:08:14.716 --> 03:08:17.819
conversations to happen in this

03:08:17.886 --> 03:08:20.255
kind of regional. Place my

03:08:20.322 --> 03:08:22.557
perspective- we have to devote

03:08:22.624 --> 03:08:23.158
as I've said before I think a

03:08:23.225 --> 03:08:24.259
much larger fraction of our

03:08:24.326 --> 03:08:25.994
budget around a permanent

03:08:26.061 --> 03:08:26.561
source of funding. The grub

03:08:26.628 --> 03:08:31.600
with homelessness but I suspect

03:08:31.667 --> 03:08:32.334
we could probably crap parts of

03:08:32.401 --> 03:08:34.970
different budgets. Again from

03:08:35.037 --> 03:08:36.271
education. Health criminal.

03:08:36.338 --> 03:08:37.939
Except in an and if we have a-

03:08:38.006 --> 03:08:40.075
swimming. In at some point

03:08:40.142 --> 03:08:42.344
obviously want to talk to the

03:08:42.411 --> 03:08:42.811
governor's office and

03:08:42.878 --> 03:08:44.613
administration about that if

03:08:44.680 --> 03:08:45.213
you have any comments on that

03:08:45.280 --> 03:08:46.314
yeah I would just say so as

03:08:46.381 --> 03:08:47.916
part of the- Canadian financing

03:08:47.983 --> 03:08:50.752
counsel. For a lot of that is

03:08:50.819 --> 03:08:53.689
has re up till recently been

03:08:53.755 --> 03:08:55.691
focused on just the funding

03:08:55.757 --> 03:08:56.158
sources are using far

03:08:56.224 --> 03:08:59.528
homelessness specifically I

03:08:59.594 --> 03:09:02.364
think we've- in. Since I am I

03:09:02.431 --> 03:09:02.998
don't think I'm selling him out

03:09:03.065 --> 03:09:06.601
but I'm the- it. Voters is arm.

03:09:06.668 --> 03:09:09.538
Federal I an on homelessness

03:09:09.604 --> 03:09:10.972
has been helping us through

03:09:11.039 --> 03:09:11.540
what a state to teach I am a

03:09:11.606 --> 03:09:13.775
look like- and I think some of

03:09:13.842 --> 03:09:16.211
what that look like having had

03:09:16.278 --> 03:09:18.680
experience of a level is not

03:09:18.747 --> 03:09:20.982
just thinking about the funding

03:09:21.049 --> 03:09:22.584
streams we have but so. How are

03:09:22.651 --> 03:09:23.185
the wraparound services being

03:09:23.251 --> 03:09:25.087
best use how are we sort of

03:09:25.153 --> 03:09:27.823
acknowledging where folks are

03:09:27.889 --> 03:09:28.457
are accessing different service

03:09:28.523 --> 03:09:29.291
were already providing at the

03:09:29.357 --> 03:09:30.592
state level and where might

03:09:30.659 --> 03:09:31.026
those folks come in

03:09:31.093 --> 03:09:31.626
conversations it's something

03:09:31.693 --> 03:09:32.728
we're very much looking up. As

03:09:32.794 --> 03:09:35.330
at about what check plan for

03:09:35.397 --> 03:09:37.766
the council the click straight

03:09:37.833 --> 03:09:41.770
and one final. The Amman's what

03:09:41.837 --> 03:09:45.340
you said around the bureaucracy

03:09:45.407 --> 03:09:46.608
that leads to fifty percent.

03:09:46.675 --> 03:09:48.710
Staff waste time. Up super

03:09:48.777 --> 03:09:50.245
interested that as well and- I

03:09:50.312 --> 03:09:50.812
would just say my colleague

03:09:50.879 --> 03:09:52.347
Mister Fung this might be a

03:09:52.414 --> 03:09:52.881
place for some bipartisan.

03:09:52.948 --> 03:09:54.182
Conversations of how we

03:09:54.249 --> 03:09:56.918
addresses because that's-

03:09:56.985 --> 03:09:59.654
outrageous. I think all have an

03:09:59.721 --> 03:10:00.622
interest in. Streamlining that

03:10:00.689 --> 03:10:01.957
and I think. Just say that is

03:10:02.023 --> 03:10:02.524
part of I think many natural

03:10:02.591 --> 03:10:05.327
hesitance around again at.

03:10:05.393 --> 03:10:06.995
Another level of bureaucracy.

03:10:07.062 --> 03:10:10.031
When you have three years of

03:10:10.098 --> 03:10:11.466
one time for. Each year creates

03:10:11.533 --> 03:10:13.401
a new set of requirements with

03:10:13.468 --> 03:10:17.405
players. At some point. A

03:10:17.472 --> 03:10:18.840
little bit character. It's not

03:10:18.907 --> 03:10:20.375
supposed to be so- low love

03:10:20.442 --> 03:10:24.379
love come in that area and like

03:10:24.446 --> 03:10:25.013
Mr ting I. Have that I need to

03:10:25.080 --> 03:10:28.116
be out at five. But look for to

03:10:28.183 --> 03:10:28.717
an ongoing conversation. Thank

03:10:28.784 --> 03:10:33.221
the for your engagement on this

03:10:33.288 --> 03:10:36.424
thank you. I'm gonna make one

03:10:36.491 --> 03:10:39.995
other point if I could to your

03:10:40.061 --> 03:10:40.629
question in a need. To leave us

03:10:40.695 --> 03:10:41.196
a moment Chiu but I want to

03:10:41.263 --> 03:10:42.464
point out that between two

03:10:42.531 --> 03:10:43.064
thousand and five two thousand

03:10:43.131 --> 03:10:46.735
and fifteen. Changed time is

03:10:46.802 --> 03:10:47.369
that redevelopment agencies one

03:10:47.435 --> 03:10:51.039
away and that of state

03:10:51.106 --> 03:10:51.573
investment in affordable

03:10:51.640 --> 03:10:53.308
housing- was reduced

03:10:53.375 --> 03:10:56.344
significantly a lot of what

03:10:56.411 --> 03:11:00.215
we're talking about in the

03:11:00.282 --> 03:11:00.849
risen to brand funding together

03:11:00.916 --> 03:11:01.449
and to be more efficient and

03:11:01.516 --> 03:11:02.184
I'm a huge support court did

03:11:02.250 --> 03:11:03.852
and better systems but at the

03:11:03.919 --> 03:11:05.954
end of the day. All is. Right a

03:11:06.021 --> 03:11:09.424
resource that everybody needs

03:11:09.491 --> 03:11:10.859
there's not enough of so I

03:11:10.926 --> 03:11:12.761
really hope that the state will

03:11:12.828 --> 03:11:14.062
focus strongly on the need for

03:11:14.129 --> 03:11:14.696
more housing because at the end

03:11:14.763 --> 03:11:17.966
of the day we're not going to

03:11:18.033 --> 03:11:18.533
be a we can have the best

03:11:18.600 --> 03:11:20.035
systems in the most rated well

03:11:20.101 --> 03:11:23.171
find systems in the world but

03:11:23.238 --> 03:11:23.738
if there's not a housing the

03:11:23.805 --> 03:11:24.306
end of the day this is gonna

03:11:24.372 --> 03:11:25.874
can. AB one. And also a point

03:11:25.941 --> 03:11:27.642
out that we're talking about.

03:11:27.709 --> 03:11:30.412
And also want to point out that

03:11:30.478 --> 03:11:32.981
during in 18322% of all

03:11:33.048 --> 03:11:36.751
Americans. Or home 2% of

03:11:36.818 --> 03:11:38.587
Americans were nineteen thirty

03:11:38.653 --> 03:11:39.187
two by nineteen sixty that was

03:11:39.254 --> 03:11:44.559
zero. That was zero and that

03:11:44.626 --> 03:11:45.126
this the solution is so in

03:11:45.193 --> 03:11:48.263
reach amended to work on time

03:11:48.330 --> 03:11:48.830
in the solution so in which

03:11:48.897 --> 03:11:50.765
were not. Really need to focus

03:11:50.832 --> 03:11:52.968
on housing at the state level.

03:11:53.034 --> 03:11:56.271
Let us locally focus on how

03:11:56.338 --> 03:11:57.906
we're going to collaborate

03:11:57.973 --> 03:12:01.676
better we need to and have to

03:12:01.743 --> 03:12:02.310
do a better job and we're we're

03:12:02.377 --> 03:12:05.247
working on it we hope that the

03:12:05.313 --> 03:12:06.648
state will really focus in on

03:12:06.715 --> 03:12:07.215
what I know assemblyman Chiu

03:12:07.282 --> 03:12:08.884
you. I was very hot there needs

03:12:08.950 --> 03:12:10.552
to be more housing read. As we

03:12:10.619 --> 03:12:13.655
just. Leadership in our city on

03:12:13.722 --> 03:12:16.524
that and I could not agree with

03:12:16.591 --> 03:12:19.995
you more- I. Stuck my

03:12:20.061 --> 03:12:20.595
colleagues know benefit of a

03:12:20.662 --> 03:12:25.133
broken record for my. Four

03:12:25.200 --> 03:12:26.835
should we lost almost two

03:12:26.902 --> 03:12:27.669
billion dollars a year. That we

03:12:27.736 --> 03:12:30.538
used to test and- housing. And

03:12:30.605 --> 03:12:34.509
over ten years dot spin awful

03:12:34.576 --> 03:12:35.143
lot of money and I think that's

03:12:35.210 --> 03:12:35.911
the scale that we need to reply

03:12:35.977 --> 03:12:39.881
back to the- to the since our

03:12:39.948 --> 03:12:40.482
but it's gonna take. A bigger

03:12:40.548 --> 03:12:41.049
conversation the legislature

03:12:41.116 --> 03:12:43.151
it's very difficult to talk

03:12:43.218 --> 03:12:45.654
about increasing funding beyond

03:12:45.720 --> 03:12:50.926
the five. Six seven hundred

03:12:50.992 --> 03:12:51.526
fifty million dollars talking

03:12:51.593 --> 03:12:54.596
about. So for to figure out how

03:12:54.663 --> 03:12:55.163
we build that consensus on

03:12:55.230 --> 03:12:59.634
making that. Thank you. Thank

03:12:59.701 --> 03:13:02.504
you the only thing I would add

03:13:02.570 --> 03:13:03.004
is that- at the loss of

03:13:03.071 --> 03:13:03.738
redevelopment as a harsh is it

03:13:03.805 --> 03:13:08.777
what does only exacerbate.

03:13:08.843 --> 03:13:09.377
Portable housing that's been

03:13:09.444 --> 03:13:11.780
produced over the last forty

03:13:11.846 --> 03:13:15.650
years or so- so this is a long

03:13:15.717 --> 03:13:16.351
standing problem- redevelopment

03:13:16.418 --> 03:13:19.321
kind of filled at the breach to

03:13:19.387 --> 03:13:23.825
a certain ex. Now we have that

03:13:23.892 --> 03:13:27.562
and- we certainly knew the duty

03:13:27.629 --> 03:13:29.664
to find a way to replace that

03:13:29.731 --> 03:13:31.199
very important funding source.

03:13:31.266 --> 03:13:35.437
So with that on on of. A German

03:13:35.503 --> 03:13:36.504
the tank I would like to thank

03:13:36.571 --> 03:13:37.005

03:13:37.072 --> 03:13:39.708
panelists- for presentations

03:13:39.774 --> 03:13:40.342
we're going to move on now to

public comment I hope that some

03:13:44.012 --> 03:13:44.579
of you have stuck around this

03:13:44.646 --> 03:13:49.150
hearing is gone- admirably

03:13:49.217 --> 03:13:55.423
longer than- any of us sent to

with Byrne advocates for youth

03:20:00.588 --> 03:20:03.057
I am here to just share our

03:20:03.124 --> 03:20:03.624
things for the 5% satisfied

03:20:03.691 --> 03:20:05.493
that went into the heap funding

03:20:05.560 --> 03:20:06.961
in the 8% satisfied that went

03:20:07.028 --> 03:20:09.263
into the half funding that was

03:20:09.330 --> 03:20:11.032
dedicated to address youth

03:20:11.099 --> 03:20:13.067
homelessness specifically this

03:20:13.134 --> 03:20:15.169
was a first time investment of

03:20:15.236 --> 03:20:19.040
the federal government does not

03:20:19.107 --> 03:20:19.607
invest directly into use. A

03:20:19.674 --> 03:20:21.476
Grammy and we do know that you

03:20:21.542 --> 03:20:23.578
are more vulnerable to

03:20:23.644 --> 03:20:26.614
victimization when they are

03:20:26.681 --> 03:20:28.349
homeless. They lose all of

03:20:28.416 --> 03:20:29.484
their possessions they take a

03:20:29.550 --> 03:20:31.986
step back in school and there

03:20:32.053 --> 03:20:33.388
isn't any other dedicated

03:20:33.454 --> 03:20:34.856
source of funding. To our youth

03:20:34.922 --> 03:20:37.392
so it's so important that this

03:20:37.458 --> 03:20:39.394
year's budget investment does

03:20:39.460 --> 03:20:42.330
include a ten percent set aside

03:20:42.397 --> 03:20:44.298
for our use based on the point

03:20:44.365 --> 03:20:46.167
time counts thank you. Thank

03:20:46.234 --> 03:20:49.537
you very much. Dr Cooper. Right

03:20:49.604 --> 03:20:53.441
here Steve but if. Thank you I

03:20:53.508 --> 03:20:54.041
hope this is being written up

03:20:54.108 --> 03:20:58.679
somewhere in a fascinating.

03:20:58.746 --> 03:20:59.280
It's actually matter fact I'm

03:20:59.347 --> 03:21:01.215
was the state support of

03:21:01.282 --> 03:21:03.184
housing coalition we're focused

03:21:03.251 --> 03:21:06.120
on permanent support housing

03:21:06.187 --> 03:21:06.721
for people with serious mental

03:21:06.788 --> 03:21:08.322
illness. And that's something

03:21:08.389 --> 03:21:10.224
we're- we're really focused on

03:21:10.291 --> 03:21:14.762
that but it relates a lot to

03:21:14.829 --> 03:21:15.329
other things you're talking

03:21:15.396 --> 03:21:16.798
about I think. One thing I hope

03:21:16.864 --> 03:21:19.801
doesn't disappear if the- if

03:21:19.867 --> 03:21:21.702
the governor's proposal doesn't

03:21:21.769 --> 03:21:22.270
really get incorporated the

03:21:22.336 --> 03:21:22.904
ways proposed at this time is

03:21:22.970 --> 03:21:24.705
that part of that was to be

03:21:24.772 --> 03:21:26.674
able to subsidize board care

03:21:26.741 --> 03:21:28.810
homes to prevent homelessness.

03:21:28.876 --> 03:21:31.379
You know because if they go

03:21:31.446 --> 03:21:32.447
they're going out of business

03:21:32.513 --> 03:21:33.014
if they go out of business

03:21:33.080 --> 03:21:35.616
they're gone- you know some

03:21:35.683 --> 03:21:39.220
cities San Francisco to good

03:21:39.287 --> 03:21:39.887
example only because he's doing

03:21:39.954 --> 03:21:42.023
some stuff that way to or

03:21:42.089 --> 03:21:42.590
trying to figure out how to

03:21:42.657 --> 03:21:47.528
stop that. And you know maybe

03:21:47.595 --> 03:21:48.996
it didn't to be a part. Well we

03:21:49.063 --> 03:21:51.199
got a with. Because it's gone

03:21:51.265 --> 03:21:54.569
will. And so open that that

03:21:54.635 --> 03:21:55.102
part. Was Cervantes. This

03:23:32.366 --> 03:23:34.435
essentially has to do with

03:23:34.502 --> 03:23:36.571
whether or not it might be

03:23:36.637 --> 03:23:37.672
better to have a funding source

03:23:37.738 --> 03:23:40.007
outside of the seven hundred

03:23:40.074 --> 03:23:42.343
fifty million since- many

03:23:42.410 --> 03:23:46.781
people- important care homes

03:23:46.847 --> 03:23:49.984
are potential potentially going

03:23:50.051 --> 03:23:52.353
to become homeless but there

03:23:52.420 --> 03:23:54.255
are many more- who will and

03:23:54.322 --> 03:23:57.525
there's just the confluence of

03:23:57.592 --> 03:23:59.894
interested the bank. Might make

03:23:59.961 --> 03:24:02.196
it better to have a separate

03:24:02.263 --> 03:24:02.830
funding source for that kind of

03:24:02.897 --> 03:24:06.634
our badly in agreement about

03:24:06.701 --> 03:24:07.501
the importance of the issue and

03:24:07.568 --> 03:24:19.113
it is shipped csus can. Did you.

03:24:19.180 --> 03:24:19.747
Want me to read your comment or

03:24:19.814 --> 03:24:24.418
did you want. We have only and-

03:24:24.485 --> 03:24:27.088
where to please give that AA.

03:24:27.154 --> 03:24:29.490
I'm Erik are fun to a yeah

03:24:29.557 --> 03:24:31.492
health the people that suffer

03:24:31.559 --> 03:24:33.894
with men health connection and

03:24:33.961 --> 03:24:36.797
print out each service.

03:24:36.864 --> 03:24:37.698
Approach in our research that

03:24:37.765 --> 03:24:40.001
can help target those that

03:24:40.067 --> 03:24:40.501
population because that

03:24:40.568 --> 03:24:42.236
population I'd I also happen

03:24:42.303 --> 03:24:47.208
this in that scene I recycling

03:24:47.274 --> 03:24:50.378
through homelessness and it

03:24:50.444 --> 03:24:52.880
becomes like a to site to

03:24:52.947 --> 03:24:56.550
families. Of that something

03:24:56.617 --> 03:24:57.184
that I really want to stress is

03:24:57.251 --> 03:25:03.324
to- maybe provide. Five in both

03:25:03.391 --> 03:25:03.924
of those. This is an meant how

03:25:03.991 --> 03:25:06.894
ready. Since I can be needs I.

03:25:06.961 --> 03:25:09.330
And the fact thank you and to

03:25:09.397 --> 03:25:12.166
you didn't identify yourself

03:25:12.233 --> 03:25:14.869
are you Maria Molly Molly okay

03:25:14.935 --> 03:25:17.371
on behalf of Natalie Natalie

03:25:17.438 --> 03:25:24.278
not hearing. Great thank you

03:25:24.345 --> 03:25:29.283
very much and- Maria Menendez.

03:25:29.350 --> 03:25:34.155
Regan. Welcome hi welcome thank

03:25:34.221 --> 03:25:34.755
you very much- I wanted to

03:25:34.822 --> 03:25:36.724
express our thanks and

03:25:36.791 --> 03:25:38.459
gratitude for the state's

03:25:38.526 --> 03:25:39.093
support and thought partnership

03:25:39.160 --> 03:25:42.363
my name is market back allowing

03:25:42.430 --> 03:25:43.864
the policy director at compass

03:25:43.931 --> 03:25:44.432
family services here in San

03:25:44.498 --> 03:25:46.400
Francisco- I wanted to echo

03:25:46.467 --> 03:25:53.541
the- the partners we need. I'm

03:25:53.607 --> 03:25:54.141
going to spending. And without

03:25:54.208 --> 03:25:55.009
additional of bureaucracy the

03:25:55.076 --> 03:25:59.046
money is. Flowing there's a the

03:25:59.113 --> 03:25:59.714
regulations that the prevent us

03:25:59.780 --> 03:26:00.347
from help the person right in

03:26:00.414 --> 03:26:05.219
front of us now- we also need

03:26:05.286 --> 03:26:05.653
to change the public

03:26:05.720 --> 03:26:06.220
conversation around cleaning

03:26:06.287 --> 03:26:08.489
the streets I we need to put

03:26:08.556 --> 03:26:09.557
people. And complaints about

03:26:09.623 --> 03:26:10.424
the sidewalks should not be the

03:26:10.491 --> 03:26:12.960
primary engines power almost

03:26:13.027 --> 03:26:14.495
systems. What we need to look

03:26:14.562 --> 03:26:15.129
beyond this there are a lot of

03:26:15.196 --> 03:26:16.497
fan that are doubled up in

03:26:16.564 --> 03:26:17.064
overcrowded and sub housing

03:26:17.131 --> 03:26:18.132
conditions and they're

03:26:18.199 --> 03:26:21.235
basically living and functional

03:26:21.302 --> 03:26:21.869
sheltered homelessness states

03:26:21.936 --> 03:26:24.939
and the regulations are and

03:26:25.005 --> 03:26:26.640
always capturing- those living

03:26:26.707 --> 03:26:29.810
situations as homelessness-

03:26:29.877 --> 03:26:33.347
there the families are very

03:26:33.414 --> 03:26:34.014
precariously house across the

03:26:34.081 --> 03:26:34.548
state the pic counts count

03:26:34.615 --> 03:26:35.116
about fourteen thousand

03:26:35.182 --> 03:26:39.086
children. Oldest data so much

03:26:39.153 --> 03:26:43.357
for over. Almost us statewide

03:26:43.424 --> 03:26:43.958
has increased on by more than

03:26:44.024 --> 03:26:46.227
20% over the past couple of

03:26:46.293 --> 03:26:48.529
years so- I think the point

03:26:48.596 --> 03:26:50.131
here is that homelessness and

03:26:50.197 --> 03:26:50.731
Pete's children intellectual

03:26:50.798 --> 03:26:53.901
social emotional and physical

03:26:53.968 --> 03:26:58.005
development- and children who

03:26:58.072 --> 03:26:58.572
are homeless are five times

03:26:58.639 --> 03:26:59.206
more likely to become homeless

03:26:59.273 --> 03:27:00.174
homeless as adults so we make

03:27:00.241 --> 03:27:01.942
sure that are meant our

03:27:02.009 --> 03:27:03.778
intervention now targeted

03:27:03.844 --> 03:27:04.411
antenna third. Homelessness is

03:27:04.478 --> 03:27:08.682
an provide the future almost.

03:27:08.749 --> 03:27:09.316
Of our- thank you could wrap up

03:27:09.383 --> 03:27:16.490
here thank you very much Choi.

03:27:16.557 --> 03:27:19.226
Liliana bonds. Hi hi I'm

03:27:19.293 --> 03:27:21.729
nervous but my name is Donna

03:27:21.796 --> 03:27:22.363
lawns in Asia of all in at the

03:27:22.429 --> 03:27:26.100
homes I have I will speak for

03:27:26.167 --> 03:27:27.468
myself and for other young

03:27:27.535 --> 03:27:29.737
women like me I feel like I've

03:27:29.804 --> 03:27:30.304
been senior everybody talk

03:27:30.371 --> 03:27:31.505
about making decisions about

03:27:31.572 --> 03:27:33.841
people like me and my community

03:27:33.908 --> 03:27:35.442
but I'm actually person that

03:27:35.509 --> 03:27:36.076
has been through it and I feel

03:27:36.143 --> 03:27:37.845
like I had been homeless for

03:27:37.912 --> 03:27:39.547
over four years I have two

03:27:39.613 --> 03:27:41.715
children I'm twenty years old-

03:27:41.782 --> 03:27:43.484
I had a homeless when I was

03:27:43.551 --> 03:27:45.753
sixteen I can not the services

03:27:45.820 --> 03:27:47.721
I thought we need continuing of

03:27:47.788 --> 03:27:49.623
money coming in but we all.

03:27:49.690 --> 03:27:53.761
Hold these these- I can you.

03:27:53.828 --> 03:27:54.361
Into your and- like for me I

03:27:54.428 --> 03:27:56.430
will homeless and I was proud.

03:27:56.497 --> 03:27:57.064
I could not get into a shelter

03:27:57.131 --> 03:27:58.132
it was so hard for me. I can

03:27:58.199 --> 03:28:00.768
get into a temporary shelter I

03:28:00.835 --> 03:28:02.703
want to the access points I

03:28:02.770 --> 03:28:03.270
want to compass I want to

03:28:03.337 --> 03:28:05.206
everywhere I needed to go. But

03:28:05.272 --> 03:28:07.241
because I didn't. That category

03:28:07.308 --> 03:28:11.078
of looking homeless. And sleep

03:28:11.145 --> 03:28:13.247
my car but because I wasn't

03:28:13.314 --> 03:28:15.316
physically on. I looked I get

03:28:15.382 --> 03:28:17.651
prioritize and I feel like.

03:28:17.718 --> 03:28:18.319
That's not ext. Especially when

03:28:18.385 --> 03:28:19.787
you're pregnant and you don't

03:28:19.854 --> 03:28:22.356
have no other sources used to

03:28:22.423 --> 03:28:22.990
prioritize. And I thought they

03:28:23.057 --> 03:28:24.225
should. Fix the way that this

03:28:24.291 --> 03:28:26.093
the system is because I know

03:28:26.160 --> 03:28:27.895
even with subsidies subsidies

03:28:27.962 --> 03:28:29.697
are temporary that is just a

03:28:29.763 --> 03:28:30.331
cycle putting people back into

03:28:30.397 --> 03:28:31.932
homelessness. And that's

03:28:31.999 --> 03:28:33.968
unacceptable you don't see when

03:28:34.034 --> 03:28:34.501
you get a subsidy and is

03:28:34.568 --> 03:28:35.903
pushing people farther out so

03:28:35.970 --> 03:28:37.771
that's what people want to lay-

03:28:37.838 --> 03:28:38.405
they're going to Stockton they

03:28:38.472 --> 03:28:39.807
want all these places. You can

03:28:39.874 --> 03:28:42.042
afford to the city California's

03:28:42.109 --> 03:28:43.777
is so expensive. In one

03:28:43.844 --> 03:28:46.080
sentence in its absurd there's

03:28:46.146 --> 03:28:46.647
not enough money that's a

03:28:46.714 --> 03:28:48.782
different flowing through your

03:28:48.849 --> 03:28:51.218
senses are so much money. And

03:28:51.285 --> 03:28:51.852
it's like how can you guys say

03:28:51.919 --> 03:28:54.321
or entry a pregnant woman like

03:28:54.388 --> 03:28:56.891
that and in people families.

03:28:56.957 --> 03:28:59.360
Like I understand it is a big

03:28:59.426 --> 03:28:59.894
thing I live here in the

03:28:59.960 --> 03:29:02.429
tenderloin. Like the mental

03:29:02.496 --> 03:29:05.599
health issues. Sources to the

03:29:05.666 --> 03:29:08.035
access. I did. It will get. It

03:29:08.102 --> 03:29:08.669
was so hard I to go to the high

03:29:08.736 --> 03:29:10.437
team I think goal his ex as the

03:29:10.504 --> 03:29:11.906
help me I had to advocate for

03:29:11.972 --> 03:29:14.141
myself at a push muscle to meet

03:29:14.208 --> 03:29:14.775
the exact director if you could

03:29:14.842 --> 03:29:16.810
please wrap up please- but I

03:29:16.877 --> 03:29:17.745
just want to see more people in

03:29:17.811 --> 03:29:19.647
the community and trying to

03:29:19.713 --> 03:29:20.214
help. To stabilize housing

03:29:20.281 --> 03:29:22.216
especially from. It's not just

03:29:22.283 --> 03:29:22.750
people with mental health

03:29:22.816 --> 03:29:27.621
issues so many young women and

03:29:27.688 --> 03:29:29.256
children and youth and families

03:29:29.323 --> 03:29:29.723
homeless street it is

03:29:29.790 --> 03:29:31.358
unacceptable especially in the

03:29:31.425 --> 03:29:32.860
city that we live in the house

03:29:32.927 --> 03:29:34.995

03:29:41.201 --> 03:29:42.469
name Tyler. Hi in the without

03:29:42.536 --> 03:29:44.672
county behavior how to act as a-

03:29:44.738 --> 03:29:48.475
welcome. Group my name so

03:29:48.542 --> 03:29:49.076

03:29:49.143 --> 03:29:50.644
the for on how. And housing

03:29:50.711 --> 03:29:52.012
that we have in here in

03:29:52.079 --> 03:29:53.847
California- but we'd like to

03:29:53.914 --> 03:29:56.216
advocate to have- a focus on

03:29:56.283 --> 03:29:59.153
prevention and early

03:29:59.219 --> 03:29:59.687
intervention- individuals

03:29:59.753 --> 03:30:01.021
experiencing homelessness- we

03:30:01.088 --> 03:30:03.657
know that the longer end of.

03:30:03.724 --> 03:30:04.825
Days on the streets and

03:30:04.892 --> 03:30:05.426
experiences the trauma of the

03:30:05.492 --> 03:30:07.995
streets that the more likely

03:30:08.062 --> 03:30:08.462
they are to develop or

03:30:08.529 --> 03:30:09.663
exacerbated by here for of can.

03:30:09.730 --> 03:30:12.066
And the more expensive they are

03:30:12.132 --> 03:30:14.268
going to be to end up receiving

03:30:14.335 --> 03:30:14.835
treatment and to stabilize

03:30:14.902 --> 03:30:16.036
them. Arm we'd like to be

03:30:16.103 --> 03:30:21.208
supportive of you going to the

03:30:21.275 --> 03:30:21.809
existing model that was under

03:30:21.875 --> 03:30:26.447
half for funding for cities

03:30:26.513 --> 03:30:28.215
counties and it CEO sees rather

03:30:28.282 --> 03:30:29.116
than this you know. Regional

03:30:29.183 --> 03:30:31.752
administrator bottle arm

03:30:31.819 --> 03:30:32.920
there's a lot of things that

03:30:32.987 --> 03:30:34.621
are under five. I'm were also

03:30:34.688 --> 03:30:36.190
supportive of. Assembly member

bloom what you mentioned I've I

03:30:38.192 --> 03:30:40.260
the crisis aborted. Our losing

03:30:40.327 --> 03:30:40.828
them today have a separate

03:30:40.894 --> 03:30:43.797
propose. To have them in. A

03:30:43.864 --> 03:30:46.300
separate pot of funding where

03:30:46.367 --> 03:30:46.934
will it be concerned about if

03:30:47.001 --> 03:30:49.470
that money slice three

03:30:49.536 --> 03:30:50.104
different ways between housing

03:30:50.170 --> 03:30:51.772
development. I'm rental

03:30:51.839 --> 03:30:53.574
subsidies and boarding cares

03:30:53.640 --> 03:30:56.043
that we may continue to lose
