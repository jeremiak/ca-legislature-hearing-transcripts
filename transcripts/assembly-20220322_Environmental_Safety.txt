MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE DR MILAN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ADMINISTRATORS WE ARE THE SPONSORS OF THIS LEGISLATION WE THANK THE AUTHOR AND STAND BY TO MAKE ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS ON THE BILL HAVE NO ONE ELSE SECURE AT THIS TIME. VERY GOOD- YEP COMMITTEE MEMBERS SHOT QUESTIONS COMMENTS THANK YOU IS CARILLO FOR AT BRINGING THIS BALLOTS AM I DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THE INCIDENT LA BUT HOW FRIGHTENING THAT IS FOR BOTH THE PARENTS OF THE CHILDREN AT NEARBY BUT ALSO FOR THE FIREFIGHTERS WHO HAD TO DEAL WITH THAT- SO I UNDERSTAND WE'RE TRYING TO DO AROUND. AND THE RETAIL EXEMPTION I THINK GIVEN THE SITUATION WE FOUND SADLY WE HAD TO FIND HER A INCIDENT LIKE BEST A GAPING HOLE IN OUR LOBBY OR CORRECTING- BUT I WANT TO TOUCH ON I THINK WHAT MAKES KEPT HE WAS REALLY FOCUSED ON WHICH IS THE FIVE YEAR REQUIREMENT I KNOW THERE. LOCK THREW FOR. RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS RIGHT NOW AND HAZARDOUS WASTE HOLDERS AND- SUPPLIERS DISTRIBUTORS. TRANSPORTERS EXCEPT IRAQ- I'M NOT A 100% SURE HOW THAT ON TOP OF OUR REGULATIONS HELP SOLVE THE PROBLEM YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE AND IT SEEMS LIKE A- IN SOME REQUIREMENT THAT. OESN'T SEEM NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS I WAS WONDER IF YOU COULD. TIMES I THINK THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- MISTER CHAN CAN PROBABLY ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE WORK THAT THE COOPERS THEMSELVES DO BUT THE FIVE YEAR REQUIREMENT IS IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE WORK IN THE STANDARDS THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE BY CALLIE PA SO. IT'S SIMPLY ALIGNING TIMELINES FOR THEM BUT I'LL CERTAINLY LET MISTER JOHN ADDRESS IT IF POSSIBLE MISTER YES GO AHEAD MISTER JOHN. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE- THE QUESTION KIND OF BASED ON THE OTHER RECORD RETENTION- COMPONENTS ARE BUT ALSO ITS LEADER TO ENSURE THERE'S NO- I GUESS SOME BASS RECORD STOP. DISCOURAGED- WHERE- HERALD HAVE BEEN MOVING- BUT DEFINITELY- WE'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU IN THE COMMITTEE TOO YOU KNOW FURTHER YOU KNOW ABOUT A WAIT. THIS PORTION REYES WHO I KEEP HEARING IS THAT WERE ALIGNING WITH OTHER REQUIREMENTS AND I JUST DON'T SEE THE NECESSITY OF ADDING ANOTHER REQUIREMENT UNLESS THERE IS A WHOLE THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I'M TRYING TO SEE IS WHAT IS THE WHOLE WE'RE TRYING TO FIX THROUGH THIS FIVE YEAR I DON'T KNOW IF THE CURRENT REQUIREMENT IS ELECTRONIC THIS DOES REQUIRE ELECTRONIC RECORD KEEPING AND FIRST. YOU KNOW SMALLER BUSINESSES CAN BE MORE BURDENSOME THAN KEEPING A FILE FOLDER SO I GUESS I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S THE CHANGER TRYING TO SEEK IN THE PROBLEM YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE WITHOUT FIVE YEAR PEACE THE REST OF THE BALLET I WANNA. BE CLEAR I UNDERSTAND. THE MAJORITY OF THE FACILITIES DO YOU I GUESS THAT TO SHIPPING TO KEEP KIND OF. YOU KNOW. WHAT TRACK RECORDS AT THIS MOMENT- AGAIN. YOU DON'T HE THOUGHT WE WERE POINT FROM WAS EXISTING LIKE BUILDING AT THAT THEY ALREADY KIND OF KEEP US RECORD SO AGAIN TRYING TO- I GUESS. KEEP IN MIND WITH. THE EASE OF- I GUESS BOTH FOR THE BUSINESS AND WITHOUT CREATING SOME ADDITIONAL YOU KNOW REQUIREMENTS OF STUFF THAT THEY OR YOU'RE KEEPING FROM OTHER REQUIREMENTS AND THAT'S WHAT WE WERE WE'RE SPECIFIC. DONE OKAY SO THIS FINISHED WITH IT SOUNDS LIKE. WHAT I'VE HEARD NOW TWICE IS THAT THIS IS BASED ON OTHER REQUIREMENTS THEY ALREADY HAVE WHICH MAKES ME BELIEVE THAT THIS ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE REQUIRING A FIVE YEAR ELECTRONIC RECORD IS UNNECESSARY. ELSEWHERE THE AIRPLANE FROM BUT I. MAYBE I JUST AM NOT GETTING CLARITY AND WE CAN GET IT AFTER THE HEARING THAT'S ALSO FINE I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT I REALLY REALLY HOPE. THAT WE DON'T PUT ADDITIONAL BURDENS ON BUSINESS WHEN THEY DON'T AREN'T NECESSARY OR SOLVING A PROBLEM AGAIN THE OTHER CHANGES IN THIS BILL I THINK ARE CLEAR AND THAT PEACE. REMAINS A MYSTERY TO ME SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN CLARIFY IT AND ENSURE THAT IT'S NOT. NECESSARILY DEFERRED AS ALWAYS- WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE TIME YOU SPEND ON THE BILLS AND ASKING GOOD QUESTIONS- AND I'M SURE WE CAN RESOLVE THAT AFTER THE HEARING TODAY. ARE SO I'LL LEAVE THAT TO THE AUTHOR- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. AND AGAIN WE CAN NOW GET INVOLVED AS WELL VOLUNTEER FOLKS- OF VOLUNTEER THE STAFF- SO I THINK IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO CLOSE THIS CARILLO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND THE INTENT TO TRY TO JUST SIMPLY MAKE THE BILL BETTER NOT CREATE DUPLICATIVE EFFORTS I WILL SAY WE HAVE A LARGE STATE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND THEY'RE ONLY EIGHTY ONE COOP US ACROSS THE STATE. SO I WOULD ADD THAT THE ADDITIONAL- ENFORCEMENT OR THE ADDITIONAL RECORD KEEPING- IS ALSO AN ART IN RESPONSE TO ENSURING THAT THESE EIGHTY ONE INDIVIDUALS HAVE ACCESS TO RECORDS FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME. DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY'RE BASED HOW MATERIALS ARE MOVED WHERE MATERIALS ARE MOVED TO AND THERE'S CONTINUITY AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE BUT OF COURSE WE'RE- ALWAYS WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE CREATE LEGISLATION THAT ULTIMATELY IS AN TO PUT US ON THAT MEETS THE GOAL OF ENSURING THE COMMUNITIES. KNOW WHAT HAZARDOUS MATERIALS IS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND FIRST AND FOREMOST WE'RE CREATING POLICY THAT SUPPORTS FIRST RESPONDERS AND DOESN'T CREATE ADDITIONAL. HAZARDS IN THEIR OWN WORK SO THANK YOU FOR THAT- I WILL I WILL. SHARE THAT. I GOT INTO THIS BASE BASED ON THE REALLY GOOD WORK THAT OUR COLLEAGUE FROM THE SOUTHEAST HAS DONE TO ENSURE THE EXITE VERNON CONTAMINATION PLAN BATTERY PLANT CONTAMINATION PLANT- DOESN'T OCCUR AGAIN WHICH IS IN FACT. THE BIGGEST ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER IN THE STATE IN COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE BUT NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT. AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE TYPES OF. EVENTS DON'T OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. AND I WANT TO THANK THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF ORAL HEALTH ADMINISTRATORS FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND FOR THEIR SPONSORSHIP OF THIS MEASURE. AS WELL AS THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH MY TEAM. I TO ENSURE THAT WE GET THIS RIGHT THIS BILL AT THIS POINT WE'RE GONNA WORK ON THE CONCERNS BUT HAS NO OFFICIAL OPPOSITION.

BUT WHICH IS THE LARGEST SOURCE OF US SOME WATER SOME POLLUTION IN OUR STATE- AND IT'S POLLUTION THAT CAN CAUSE SOME SERIOUS PUBLIC IN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS AS WE KNOW THE STORM WATER IS THE WATER THAT RUNS OFF OF ROOFS SIDEWALKS IN OTHER PAID WATER THEN IT DRAINS INTO RUNOFF CHANNELS THAT CRISSCROSS THROUGH THE LANDSCAPE AND ALONG THE WAY THE WATER RUN OFF IT ACCUMULATED TOXIC SLEW OF CHEMICALS. OIL FERTILIZER TRASH HEAVIER HARD METALS AND OTHER POLLUTANTS. B. B. FOR THE B. AFFORD ENTERS A STORM DRAIN AND EVENTUALLY MAKES ITS WAY OUT INTO THE OCEAN. SO SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE FEDERAL CLEAN WATER ACT THIS IS THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THAT- FEDERAL LAW WE HAVE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS IS THE STATE NO WE HAVE- WE HAVE PROVEN AS A STATE THAT WE CAN CLEAN AND RESTORE OUR WATERWAYS IN MANY PARTS. OF CALIFORNIA UNFORTUNATELY LITTLE PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN REDUCING STORM WATER- SOME POLLUTION- THE- ACROSS OUR STATE. AND IT'S BECOMING A GROWING PROBLEM EVEN AS OUR CURRENT- ARE PERMITS JUST IMPOSES SIGNIFICANT COSTS ON THE REGULATED- THE- THE COMMUNITY. THE RESULT IS THAT- ESPECIALLY OUR MOST UNDERSERVED- SOME COMMUNITIES WERE NOT ACHIEVING OUR WATER QUALITY GOALS. AND WE'RE NOT ON TRACK TO DO SO. SO THIS LEGISLATION SEEKS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IN THREE WAYS FIRST AND MORE IMPORTANTLY- THIS LEGISLATION WOULD REQUIRE THE STATE WATER BOARD TO CONDUCT A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. BUT TO TAKE A COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT HOW THE STATE'S STORMWATER PROGRAM CAN ACHIEVE SOME BETTER RESULTS AT LESS COST TO THE PERMIT THESE. THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS SIMPLY NOT WORKING FOR ANYONE. AND WE CERTAINLY NEED TO GET BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD. AND SECOND. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE STATE WATER BOARD TO CREATE A NEW PERMIT. A PERMIT THAT WOULD COVER SOME CURRENTLY UNREGULATED SOURCES OF STORMWATER- SOME POLLUTION. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT THE BURDEN OF COMPLIANCE IS MORE FAIRLY. DISTRIBUTED ACROSS ALL SOURCES OF STORMWATER. AND WOULD ALSO CREATE REGULATORY CONSISTENCY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AND FINALLY THIS BILL WOULD MODERNIZE OUR STORMWATER DATA SYSTEMS. ARE SO THAT THEY WORK BETTER FOR BOTH REGULATORS AND- THE- PERMITIR THIS- AND TOGETHER THESE PROPOSALS SEEK TO PUT US BACK ON TRACK. AB THE C. TO PUT IT BACK ON TRACK TO MAKE PROGRESS IN ELIMINATING THESE DANGEROUS STORM WATER- SOME POLLUTION WHICH AGAIN IS THE LARGEST SOURCE OF WATER- SOME POLLUTION ACROSS OUR ENTIRE STATE. BECAUSE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE CLEAN WATER TO ALL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WE MUST DO SO REGARDLESS OF INCOME. AND STATUS OR ZIP CODE YOU KNOW ACCOMPLISHING THIS IS CRITICAL. I IN THE MEANTIME WE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS AS WE HAVE APPRECIATE. ALL OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT- TO FURTHER REFINE THE LANGUAGE OF THIS LEGISLATION AND WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY IS SEAN BOSWELL OF THE CALIFORNIA COAST KEEPER ALLIANCE. AND NICOLE I HILL OF THE OUR WATER L. A. COALITION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU CHECK WORK AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SEAN BOTHWELL I AND- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA COAST COMPLIANCE AND I WOULD URGE YOUR- I'D VOTE AND SUPPORT ON SOME LEGAL TWENTY ONE OF SIX- I WANTED TO ADDRESS SECTION THREE OF THE BILL WHICH IS THE COMMERCIAL. INSTITUTIONAL INDUSTRIAL STORMWATER PERMIT- THAT NUMBER RIVAS OF MENTION JUST A SECOND AGO. SO WE REALLY SEE THIS PERMIT IS AN EXCITING OPPORTUNITY UP BECAUSE IT WOULD ACCOMPLISH FOUR THINGS ONE IT WOULD ADDRESS A CURRENTLY COMPLETELY UNREGULATED SOURCE OF STORMWATER POLLUTION. TO IT WOULD REDUCE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CURRENT LIABILITY FOR THAT RUNOFF THAT'S COMING OFF THOSE COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES AND THEN INTO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MUNICIPAL STORM DRAIN. IT WOULD INCENTIVIZE STORMWATER CAPTURE AND RE USE AND COULD PROVIDE- A CREATIVE SOURCE OF CAR SHARING BETWEEN THE COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES AND THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BUILD MORE CENTRALIZED STORMONT TO CAPTURE- ON A MORE REGIONAL BASIS. I IN LOS ANGELES THE U. S. EPA IN THE REGIONAL BOARD ARE ABOUT TO RELEASE ONE OF THESE COMMERCIAL STORMONT PERMITS- IN APRIL. THEY ANTICIPATE IT WILL BE ADOPTED BY THIS SEPTEMBER SO ONLY SIX MONTHS AFTER- THE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT- HAS STARTED. THIS LEGISLATION IS GOING TO GIVE THE STATE WATER BOARD TWO AND A HALF YEARS. AFTER THE L. A. PERMAN IS ADOPTED TO SEE HOW THE PERMIT IS BEING IMPLEMENTED TO SEE ANY CONCERNS THAT MIGHT BE OCCURRING BETWEEN THE COMMERCIAL FACILITY IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AT THE IRON THOSE OUT FOR STATEWIDE LEVEL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET OUT ALL OF THE PROBLEM AN ISSUE AREAS. I DON'T BE CLEAR AT THIS LEGISLATION ONLY REQUIRES THE STATE BOARD TO RELEASE A PUBLIC DRAFT BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. AND THAT'S REALLY WHEN THE OFFICIAL PUBLIC STAKEHOLDER PROCESS BEGINS- AND SO WE THINK THERE'S MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME. FOR THE STATE TO SEE HOW THAT PERMITS WORKING AND TO MAKE SURE IT'S WORKABLE FOR EVERY REGION- THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I ALSO WANTED TO ADDRESS WHY STATEWIDE ORDERS IS APPROPRIATE INSTEAD NINE INDIVIDUAL REGIONAL. PERMITS RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE ON OUR FINGER TIPS THAT. WOULD ALLOW US TO PETITION EACH OF THE REGIONS TO DO ONE OF THESE. PERMITS INDIVIDUALLY. BUT WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES TO ONE HAVE SOME STATEWIDE CONSISTENCY SO THEY SO THEY KNOW WHAT THE RULES OF THE GAME ARE. AND TO. IF THEY HAVE MULTIPLE PROPERTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE THEY WOULD HAVE THE SAME TYPE OF COMPLIANCE PATH AND SO THERE WOULD BE A CLEAR CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE STATE. IT ALSO BE MORE COST EFFECTIVE. FOR THE STATE TO DO ONE PERMIT. THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE SEQUEL AND THAT THAT THAT'S A QUITE A BIG BURDEN ON THE STATE WATER BOARD. RATHER THAN EACH REGIONAL BOARD DO THEIR OWN PERMIT AND THEIR OWN SEQUEL PROCESS. WE REALLY FEEL LIKE IT PROVIDES A STATE ENOUGH TIME- WHILE PROVIDING. A MORE EFFICIENT WAY OF GETTING THIS PERMIT- COMPLETED. SOME COLLUSION- AS MEMBER RIVAS SAID OF THE COMPANY STORE PROGRAM IT'S NOT WORKING IT'S TIME TO MODERNIZE IT- IT'S TIME FOR US TO LOOK AT A HOLISTIC APPROACH. TO STORMWATER MANAGEMENT TO IDENTIFY SOURCES OF POLLUTION AND CONTROL THEM AT ITS SOURCE. AND TO ENCOURAGE STORM WATER CAPTURE AND THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH WITH THE REGULATED COMMUNITY- SINCE LAST YEAR'S LEGISLATION. TO REALLY FIND AREAS OF COMMON GROUND THAT WE CAN WORK ON TOGETHER AND WE ALL AGREE WE NEED TO DO MOVING FORWARD. SO WITH THAT- I THINK YOU IN AFTER ABOUT. THERE ARE VERY GOOD- SO PHONE MODEL- LET'S SEE NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM THE COAL- HAIL THE REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR WATER LA COALITION ON THE PHONE LINE. AND THE CALL CAN YOU SPEAK UP NOW. THANK YOU FOR CORRECTING COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS NICOLE HYLTON HERE TODAY REPRESENTING THE OUR WATER L. A. COALITION AND I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT EIGHTY TWENTY ONE OF SIX. OUR WATER LA IS A DIVERSE COALITION OF COMMUNITY LEADERS AND ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS PHILLY COUNTY UNITED TO CREATE A STRONG WATER FEATURE FOR LOS ANGELES AND AB TWENTY ON A SIX CRITICAL TO OUR GOAL TO SECURE CLEAN SAFE AFFORDABLE AND RELIABLE WATER HERE. CALIFORNIA AND LOS ANGELES IN PARTICULAR HAS FAILED TO FULLY REALIZE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CAPTURE STORM WATER AND TREATED AS A RESOURCE THAT THAN JUST TO PUT IN AB TWENTY ONE SIX WILL MAKE STATE WATER BOARD TOOK A HARD LOOK AT THE CURRENT TIME WATER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. AND REQUIRE MORE MODERN HOLISTIC APPROACH TO PREVENTING STORMWATER POLLUTANT AT THEIR STORES KIDDING. ALL WATER AT THE BALLOT. CAN YOU HEAR ME. CAN YOU HEAR ME. YOU HEAR ME. CAN YOU HEAR ME. YEAH THE VOLUME BUTTONS WILL CONTROL THE ARM. THE VOLUME BUTTONS WILL CONTROL THE SPEAKER OUT ON THE D. X. EIGHTY SO THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE WHERE THINGS ARE GOING ON AREN'T GOING RIGHT. DEPENDS. THAT RISES- YEAH THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HARD. WITH THE- YEAH WE CAN. EXTRA THAT'S AGAIN. WHAT ME WE CAN HERE- GOOD THANK YOU FOR FIXING THAT- SO WHERE WERE WE OH YES HAVE HEARD FROM WITHIN ROOM NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO THE PHONE LINE. AND MISTER READ EIGHTEEN T. IF YOU COULD GIVE US OUR- AS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO EITHER ARE OPPOSED OR IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY ONE OH SIX. ARE TO SPEAK AND TO GIVE THEIR NAME ORGANIZATION AND POSITION THANK YOU. IMAGINE IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK ON THIS LEGISLATION PLEASE PRESS ONE TO ZERO AT THIS TIME. WE'LL START WITH LINE SIXTY FIVE PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI THIS IS KIRTI HUGHES FOR THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE AT THE PRODUCERS I WE HAVE TO TAKE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE BILL- BUT YOU AFTER SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED- BY THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO SECTION FOUR. AND SOME WORRY THAT THEY MAY HAVE SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WITH REGARD TO OUR REMOVING DISCRETION FROM THE REGIONAL AND STATE WATER BOARDS WE WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU. NEXT TO HEADLINE FORTY NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS BOB SPIEGEL SENIOR POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ALIGNING OUR COMMENTS WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NEXGEN ONE FORTY SEVEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ERIN WILL BE HALF OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF AB. AT TWENTY ONE SIX. NEXT A LITTLE AND FORTY ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD. I AM KAREN KALLEN WITH THE CALIFORNIA STAR WATER QUALITY ASSOCIATION WE HAVE NOT TAKEN A POSITION ON THE BILL AT THE TIME THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING EXTENSIVELY WITH THE FASTER AND MORE AT THE OFFICE OFFICE AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO- TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE THAT WE RAISED IN OUR COMMON LETTER THAT WITH. ME. AND NEXT WILL GO TO ONE SIXTY SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD HELP WITH THE SITUATION CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. MISTER TERRY HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. ALL RIGHT THEN- THERE BEING NO ONE ELSE MISTER SMITH. TO FILL UP WITH COUPLE OF CONCERNS THAT I HAVE BECAUSE I KNOW A NEW CONSTRUCTION THEY GOT STORMWATER. RETENTION PONDS COST HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS I'M WONDERING IF THIS BILL WOULD TRIGGER OMER REMODELER PAVING OF THE PARKING LOT TO TRIGGER THAT SO THEY GOTTA GO TO STORM WATER RETENTION POND. OUR SYSTEM HUNG. MORE CONSTRUCTION LANGUAGE AND BEFORE BUT THAT IS MY CONCERN BECAUSE THAT WOULD YOU KNOW WE'RE JUST GOING TO PAY THE PARKING BUT IT'S GOING TO ADD HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MORE ALL DEPENDS ON WHICH- HOW BIG A SPUR FOOTAGE IS ON PARTICULAR. STRIP MALL MARKET INDUSTRIAL WHATEVER THAT AND THAT'S MY OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN ADDRESS IT OR NOT. SO WE TRIED OUR BEST IN THE LEGISLATION TO NOTS. BE RESTRICTIVE OR NOT TAKE ANY DISCUSSION FROM THE WATER BOARDS ON HOW THEY'RE GONNA CUT THE PERMITS WE TRY TO KEEP IT VERY HIGH LEVEL- AND- BUT FROM WHAT WE KNOW THAT'S COMING OUT OF LOS ANGELES AND I CAN SPEAK TO THAT BORDER. THE IN THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS I THINK YOU SEE SOME SUPPORT FROM SOME OF THE EXISTING STORMWATER PERMIT TV'S. OR YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA GET THERE BUT- IS BASICALLY IT THE WE EXPECT THE PERMITS HAVE THREE OF THE FLEXIBLE OPTIONS FOR COMPLIANCE. IT'S A ONE OF THEM IS WHAT WHAT YOU JUST SAID TO BE ABLE TO BUILD STORMWATER CAPTURE ON THE PROPERTY ITSELF. THE OTHER TWO IS EITHER JUST ME- WATER PLACED ENTERED SO IF YOU IF YOU TO RUNOFF COMING FROM THE PROPERTY HAS NO POLLUTION IN IT. THEN YOU'RE IN COMPLIANCE AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUILD ANYTHING IT'S THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE OPTIONS. THE LAST. THE LAST OPTION WOULD BE- TO. TO PAY INTO A DO A COST SHARE WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND THEN AGAIN THEY WOULD THEY WOULD BUILD THE LARGER STORMWATER CAPTURE ON MORE CENTRALIZED. TEACHER AND THAT THAT'S SAVES A LOT OF COST BECAUSE IT IT. BASICALLY CAPTURES ALL THE SOMEONE TREATS ALL SOMEONE FROM EVERYONE UP UP IN THE WATERSHED. BECAUSE AT THE CONCERT WITH FIG ALRIGHT THE SMALL WATER TEST SYSTEM FOR JUST SAY THE BLOCK NEIGHBORHOOD. WHO'S GOING TO MONITOR TEST THAT SO THEN IT GOES INTO THE STORMWATER SYSTEM L. A. RIVER. WHO'S GONNA TESTED THERE AND WHO'S GONNA TEST OF JUST BEFORE IT HITS THE OCEAN. BECAUSE WE KNOW AFTER STORM WATER RAINFALL IT COMES SOMETIMES A BEACH IS CLOSE FROM ALL OF THAT UNDERSTAND TRYING TO KEEP CLEAN WATER. BUT HOW MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS MIGHT BE ADDED TO THIS COST THAT'S MY BIGGEST CONCERN IN WHO'S GOING TO PAY. PARTICULAR INDUSTRY PROTECT INDIVIDUALS AND SOME ARE GONNA BE ABLE TO AFFORD. IT WOULD LOSE MORE BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA. GO AHEAD MISS OUR QUE HAN. THANK YOU SO I THINK. WHEN I READ THE BILL I WAS A LITTLE STUMPED BY SORT OF WHAT YOU HIGHLIGHTED TODAY WHICH IS THE LACK OF CLARITY AND WHAT IT IS WE'RE ACTUALLY. I HAVE AT THE END. THESE NEW STORMWATER PERMITS WILL LOOK LIKE WHICH- I'LL BE HONEST MAKES ME A LITTLE UNEASY- AND SO. I HEAR YOU'RE DOING THAT BUT I GUESS PART OF ME THEN QUERIES WHETHER. THE TIMING OF THIS IS OFFER YOU'RE WAITING UNTIL THE L. A. PERMIT COMES OUT YOU CAN SEE HOW IT GOES YOU CAN LEARN FROM IT THE STATE WATER CAN LEARN FROM IT AND THEN THEY WILL IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR DO THIS. BASED ON THOSE LEARNINGS IS WHAT I HEARD YOU SAY AFTER THE TIME I CAME FROM. SO I GUESS CREE WHY WE'RE DOING THIS BEFORE WE SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN LA. WHERE WE PRESUPPOSING THAT THIS IS A GOOD IDEA NOW RATHER THAN. WAITING A YEAR AND SEEING I GUESS CAN SOMEBODY ADDRESS THAT SHOT BUT I THINK YOU KNOW THE REASON WE'RE DOING THIS IS BECAUSE- THIS IS A PROBLEM THE BIG PROBLEM AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A VERY PUBLIC PROCESS IN LA AND THEY'RE ABOUT YOU KNOW VERY SOON TO- PPD IN THEIR OFFICIAL- MAYO THE RELEASE OF- THEIR REGULATION THEY'RE PERMITTING PROCESS AND THEY CAN BEGIN THAT PUBLIC PROCESS- AND SO CERTAINLY WE'RE GONNA HAVE A LOT OF CLARITY ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE DOING IN A MATTER OF DAYS OR WEEKS. OF TRYING TO POINT OUT THAT IT COULD NOT. ALSO SAKE SO. WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT THIS POLLUTION IS COMING OFF THESE FACILITIES AND UNDER THE CLEAN WATER ACT THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED NOW AND TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST I HAD THE OPTION OF WE COULD WIN TEACH REGIONAL BOARD AND PETITION EACH OF THEM OR WE THOUGHT THIS WAS THE MORE KIND COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO DO IT IN MORE RESPONSIBLE WAY TO DO IT BECAUSE WE BUILD OUT THE TIME FOR IT. AND SO THE LA ONE IS GOING TO BE ADOPTED IN SEPTEMBER AND WE KNOW WHAT'S IN IT IT HASN'T HIT THE STREET YET BUT I KNOW WHAT'S IN THE ORDER I THINK THIS SORT OF PROPERTIES UNDERSTAND THEY'VE ALREADY HAD CYCLE TO MAKE SO WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO BE IN THERE AND I THINK THE IDEA IS RIGHT NOW IN THIS THIS GETS TO THE OTHER POINT MADE. RIGHT NOW THE MUNICIPALITIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THEY'RE THE ONES ON THE HOOK THEY'RE THE ONES RIGHT NOW THAT ARE INCURRING THE LIABILITY COSTS FROM THIS RUNOFF IT'S GOING INTO THEIR M. S. FOR THEIR THE ONES THAT HAVE THE MONITOR FOR IT AND NOW THEY'RE THE ONES RIGHT NOW THAT ARE IN CHARGE OF IT IT'S A REALLY WE SEE THIS AS- A LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD SO THAT EVERYONE IS EQUALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR CONTRIBUTION OF THIS THE STORM WATER RUNOFF. AND YET WE BUILT OUT TIME TO TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TO ANYTHING HAS TO HIT THE STREETS FOR PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT BUT THE STATE BOARD'S GONNA START WORKING ON THIS A MEDIALLY ENDED IN FACT WHEN WE TALK TO THEM THEY ONLY WANTED US TO REALLY WAIT UNTIL THE YOU KNOW TO SEE HOW THE PUBLIC COMMENT CAME OUT AND HOW THE REVISED THAT JUST LA PERMIT FORGET THE PART ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION THEY JUST WANT TO SEE WHAT KIND OF ISSUES GOT REYES. AND SO WE BUILT IN EXTRA TIME JUST AND REALLY I THINK WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS THIS UNIQUE FEATURE THE ALTERNATE COMPLIANCE PATH OF THE FACILITY BEING ABLE TO PAY- THE WITH THE MUNICIPALITY TO DO A CARSHARE PROGRAM THAT'S REALLY NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE SO THAT'S KIND OF THE PART TO BE WORKED OUT BUT NO ONE IS FORCING THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO HAVE TO DO THOSE AGREEMENTS AND I THINK TWO AND A HALF YEARS TO CUT HIGHER NOT HOW DOES AND WILL USE WILL WORK. IT IS SUFFICIENT TIME TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT- AND IF IT'S NOT. THE STATE BORDER TAKE LONG. BEFORE SOME. AND ALL. KNOWN LOCAL. IS BEING REQUIRED TO DO. OF THE ANY OF THIS KIND OF CAR SHARING AGREEMENT WITH THEM IT'S JUST THAT. ONE OF THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE. AND AGAIN MUNICIPALITIES. HAVE TO DO THIS ANYWAY. SO IT CAN I JUST AND MAYBE USE THAT AS MY APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE IF YOU DID SO REGIONAL. REGIONAL BOARDS COPIES TO DO THIS ALREADY CAN THE STATE BOARD DO A STATEWIDE PERMIT NOW. OR WE ENABLING THEM TO DO SOMETHING THEY DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO. THEY CAN. THEY CAN DO IT NOW IF THEY IF THEY WANTED TO YES. OKAY SO. WHAT HAVE THEY WAIT AND DO THEY WANT TO DO IS STATEWIDE AND I ALSO THINK ABOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I WANT TO I ACTUALLY SHOULD HAVE STARTED BY SAYING. HOW GRATEFUL I AM TO. HAVE A RIVAS FOR HIS DEDICATION. TO STORMWATER RUNOFF IT IS AS HE POINTED OUT. A REALLY BIG ISSUE- AND ONE THAT WE SHOULD BE ADDRESSING I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING IT IN THE SMARTEST WAY. AND GIVEN SORT OF WHAT I FOUND TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF THE- VACANT H. OR- OF THE BILL AS IT STANDS TODAY. I JUST HAD A LOT OF QUESTIONS SO CAN YOU AS A THIRD. YEAH AND I CAN JUST THE VAGUE NATURE OF IT. WE DID THAT ON PURPOSE ALMOST AS A COMMITMENT TO SOME OF THE- THE- THE PROPERTIES AND THE FOLKS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO ON STORMWATER STUFF BECAUSE- IN FACT WE TOOK AMENDMENTS. ALSO TALKING TO CALCHAMBER. BECAUSE NO ONE WANTED. OUR BILL LANGUAGE TIED SPECIFICALLY TO THE L. A. PERMIT WE TOOK THAT OUT. BECAUSE OF THE OTHER FOLKS ASK FOR THAT- AND SO THAT'S WHY WE TRY TO KEEP A HIGH LEVEL. I ALSO JUST WANTED TO BE RESPECTFUL. LAST YEAR WHEN WE ARE IN THIS COMMITTEE OF THE KNOT TYING THE BOARD'S HANDS GIVING THEM ALL THEIR DISCRETION. SO THAT THEY CAN DEFINE. I KNOW ONE OF THE ISSUES WAS HOW LARGE OF A FACILITIES IS GOING TO COVER. AND JUST SO EVERYONE KNOWS THAT RIGHT NOW IN THE LA PERMITS THEY'RE PROPOSING A FIVE ACRES WHICH IS A FAIRLY LARGE FOR. OF PARKING. THOSE ARE THE TYPE OF DISCUSSION THAT I DON'T WANT TO. SELF IMPOSE INTEL THE WATER BOARD WHAT TO DO SO THAT'S WHY WE LEFT IT. OPEN BUT ALSO WERE. IF THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME MORE DETAILS OF WHAT EXACTLY WHAT IT IS I'M FINE WITH THAT WE WERE TRYING TO. COMPROMISE WITH THAT THE FOR THE FOLKS- AND THEN THE WATER BOARD. WHAT IS. THIS OKAY WHATEVER YOU MAKE SURE YOU'RE SPEAKING INTO THE MICROPHONE. SO ASK THE STATE WATER WHAT HAVE THEY WEIGHED IN ON THIS AND THINK IF THEY ARE YOU HAVE A STORY BUT DON'T APPEAR TO BE RIGHT. ACCENTING RV CAGES ANSWER QUESTION WE ARE SCHEDULED TO ENGAGE WITH WATER BOARD BUT LATER THIS WEEK OKAY. THANK YOU ALL THREE PIECES OF LEGISLATION OKAY. AND SO I DON'T WANNA SPEAK FOR THEM BUT THEY HAVE BEEN VERY INVOLVED IN THE L. A. ORDER. AND I THINK THEY'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL THAT IT HAS. BECAUSE AGAIN IT. REGULATE SOMETHING THAT'S CURRENTLY ON REGULATED. THAT'S NOW THE MUNICIPALITIES LIABILITY. AND IT CREATES THESE ALL THESE. FLEXIBLE OPTIONS THAT WE REALLY DIDN'T HAVE AN PERMITS BEFORE AND THEY'RE EXCITED ABOUT. AND THAT'S WHY IT'S IN THIS BILL MODERNIZING STORMWATER IS BASE SEE THIS IS THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE. AND SO I THINK THEY ARE EXCITED ABOUT IT NOT IN AN OFFICIAL POSITION ONE BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO THEM OFFICIALLY YET. BUT FROM TALKS WITH THEM LEADING UP TO THIS I THINK. THEY LIKE THE CONCEPT OF THE GOING FORTH. GOT IT I'M- SO I MEAN. AGAIN I THINK YOU KNOW. I GUESS THE QUESTION BEFORE US IS DO WE FORCE THE STATE WATER BOARD TO DO THE STATEWIDE PERMIT GIVEN THEY ALREADY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO IT- BECAUSE WE THINK SO I GUESS WE'RE MAKING THE DECISION WE THINK STATEWIDE IS BETTER THAN A REGIONAL APPROACH RIGHT I MEAN I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I'M HEARING. IS REALLY THE QUESTION BEFORE US BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE CAN SAY IT'S GOING TO BE A FIVE ACRE PERMIT IT'S GOING TO BE HOW THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR IT AND WE HAVE NONE OF THOSE DETAILS. IN THE LANGUAGE WE ARE MERELY. ASKING THE STATE BOARD. TO DO A STATEWIDE PERMIT AGAIN WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE LA. ORDER SO WE DON'T EVEN HAVE THE BASIS ON WHICH THEY'RE DOING THAT. SO THAT'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS I'M- AND NOT A LOT OF ANSWERS AND SO I GUESS MY- I MEAN I GUESS MY REAL GOT HERE IS SAYING YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T THE MOMENT FOR THIS EVEN IF THIS IS THE ULTIMATE THING WE SHOULD DO- OF THE TIMING IS REALLY THE QUESTION. THAT I HAVE BEFORE ME AND- I GUESS AND YOU DECIDE BUT I WILL SAY THAT I DO REALLY APPRECIATE THE PEACE OF THE BILL THAT MODERNIZES THE DATABASE I THINK WE DO A HORRIBLE JOB OF THE GOVERNMENT ON DATA. INSTEAD IT LEADS TO- IN ACTION AND- THE FAILURE TO REALLY- BE SMART ABOUT OUR MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOCUS ON THE STREET. YEAH I KNOW I APPRECIATE- THOSE COMMENTS AND I THINK WHEN YOU- ASSESS THIS PROBLEM HOW SOME COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY THOSE OF COLOR ARE IMPACTED MORE SO HAN OTHERS I THINK CREATING A STATEWIDE- CONSISTENCY WHEN COMES ISSUES INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT RATHER THAN TO HAVE THIS PATCHWORK OF- OF- YOU KNOW STATE IN THESE DIFFERENT- THESE- THESE PROCESSES THAT NEED TO OCCUR WITH- YOU KNOW ALL THE ALL THE DIFFERENT BY MAIL IMPACTS AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING IN ME TIMELY STONE. IF YOU DON'T TAKE A LOT OF TIMES OF HAVING A- STATEWIDE- PROCESS IS IMPORTANT. ESPECIALLY FOR STATE LIKE OURS. OKAY MISC ARE YOU FINISHED OKAY MISS GARCIA. NOT THINK YEAH I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION I THOUGHT A COUPLE COMMENTS ON THIS BILL- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE L. A. RIVER AND THE THING GABLE RIVER WHICH IS THE OTHER MAJOR- FLOOD CHANNEL STORMWATER. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT ACTUALLY BOOK AND MY DISTRICT I THE BOOK IN A DISTRICT THAT'S HEAVY LATINO IMMIGRANT WORKING CLASS COMMUNITY AND FOR FIFTY YEARS- THE COMMUNITY THAT THE- CURRENT LAWS HAVE BEEN WORK FOR US- IT'S- A BASE AND THAT'S FULL OF COPPER KDM SEEING LET OIL- DANGERS LIKE TERRY AND TRASH. ANY GIVEN DAY OF THE WEEK IS THE REALITY THAT WE LIVE IN AND SO THE CURRENT LAW HASN'T WORKED UNTIL WE DO NEED A STATE WHERE I'VE HAD TO MAKE SURE THESE COMMUNITIES THAT. CONTINUE TO BE LEFT BEHIND ARE NO LONGER LEFT BEHIND THE TIMING FEELS UNCOMFORTABLE I KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF DETAILS I STILL NEED TO BE WORKED OUT. BUT WE'RE REALLY EARLY IN THE PROCESS THIS YEAR OR NOT EARLY IN THIS PROCESS THIS IS A DISCUSSION I STARTED- PREVIOUSLY- ELEVEN MYSTERY OF US. AND IT WE WILL BE HAVING MORE DETAILS FROM THE ALLEY. AND WITHIN. OR WEEKS TOPS REALLY AREN'T REALLY ON AND SO WE HAVE.A LOT OF TIME TO HAMMER THINGS OUT. AND THEN START TO IMPLEMENT- THINGS ALONG THE WAY AND SO. I WOULD SAY THAT THE QUESTIONS YOU'RE ASKING ARE IMPORTANT ARE IMPORTANT TO ME ALSO BECAUSE I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S ENOUGH DETAIL TO THAT. OVER PROMISING TO MY CONSTITUENTS WILL BECOME A REALITY IN WITH ONLY TO MY TIME TO GET READY SO THAT NOTHING GETS STUCK THAT'S ALSO REALITY WE LEFT WITH. AND SO I APPRECIATE. THOSE QUESTIONS BUT THOSE COMMUNITIES WERE TALKING ABOUT. ARE ARE VERY CONCENTRATED ON. BASED ON RACE AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. ACROSS THE STATE AND SO I WANT TO THANK- I WANTED THINK INVITE YOU TO JOIN US AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THOSE DETAILS NOW AND- NOT LATER BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE DETAILS REALLY QUICKLY BUT FROM THE CITY. FROM THE ALLEY REGION. OKAY MISTER MURATSUCHI THANK YOU START TALKING ABOUT THE- THE CONCERN THAT I KNOW MY CITIES HAVE RAISED- WHICH IS THE THAT THE HIGH SCHOOL THE HIGH COST OF A COMPLIANCE OF FOR CITIES- IN MY HEARING YOU CORRECTLY I HEAR THAT THE CALCHAMBER RAISING CONCERNS AND I DON'T SEE THE LEAGUE OF CITIES ARE ALL THE CITIES IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL IS THE BASIC APPROACH OF THIS BILL TO MAKE POLLUTERS PAY THE CLEAN UP THEIR OWN MESS SO THAT CITIES DON'T HAVE TO BE SET UP WITH THE COST OF CLEANUP. THAT'S PRETTY GOOD WAY TO SUMMARIZE IT YEAH OKAY- I WILL SAY SO WE WERE HAVING TALKS WITH SO I DON'T KNOW HOW TO. FIX IT- WITH THE LEAGUE- WE'VE BEEN MOSTLY WORKING WITH CATS ONE OF WHICH IS THE CONTEST THE STORM WATER STAKEHOLDERS KAREN WHO SPOKE EARLIER. WITH A MOSTLY WORKING WITH THEM- SO WE HAVE BEEN TALKING WITH THEM WE DO THINK WE'LL WE'LL GET TO A SUPPORT POSITION THERE'S JUST SOME MORE MINUTES SO WE'VE BEEN TAKING AMENDMENTS AND DISCUSSING THINGS AS WE'VE BEEN MOVING FORWARD- WITH THEM AND BUT A WITH- ACCOUNTS WERE. SPEAKING FOR MUNICIPAL YOU'RE SPEAKING FOR MUNICIPALITIES SUIT I DON'T SPEAK FOR THEM BUT LARGELY THAT'S WHO THEY REPRESENT ON STORM WATER. WHAT KIND OF THINGS OKAY. GREAT THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT AFTER I HAVE LOTS OF QUESTIONS- FOR OF ALL EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO WHEN I STARTED ON CITY COUNCIL THEY SAID YOU KNOW THERE'S THIS STORM WATER MANDATE. AND THE WAY IT LOOKS IS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BUILD A SECOND- WATER PURIFICATION SYSTEM JUST TO DEAL WITH STORMWATER. WHICH IS A FEW BILLION DOLLARS- SO. MAYBE IT'S JUST HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS BUT IT WAS MORE THAN THE CITY FELL TO COULD AFFORD- AND NO WAY TO FINANCE IT SO THIS IS A WAY TO FINANCE BUT- I'M TRYING TO VISUALIZE SO YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT WHAT THE L. A. SIS THE L. A- ROSS THIS IS BUT IT'S ONLY FOR A SMALL PART OF THE CITY RIGHT JUST A PARTICULAR. A DRAINAGE BASIN CORRECT IT'S EL CERRITO SPENT AND BIGGEST CHANNEL. OKAY SO IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THE WHOLE OF L. A. COUNTY. NOT CURRENTLY NO SO THE COURT CASE THAT- REQUIRED THEM TO GO FORWARD WITH THAT REQUIRED THE EPA TO GO FORWARD WITH IT. ON HOW MUCH I CAN DISCUSS AND- BUT- THE EPA WANTED TO JUST DO WHAT THE COURT SAID TO DO- AND NOT SPEAKING FOR THE WATER BOARDS BUT I THINK THEY WERE THINKING WELL THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT MORE BROADLY THAN JUST THAT WHAT THE COURT SAID SO ARE YOU ENVISIONING THAT. SOMETIME IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. EVERY PARKING LOT GREATER THAN FIVE ACRES WOULD HAVE TO START PAYING INTO A FUND OR COME UP WITH SOME SORT OF. MITIGATION EVERYONE IN THE STATE ARE FIVE ACRES OR MORE SO THE WAY THE CLEAN WATER ACT WORKS THERE NEEDS TO BE A NEXUS BETWEEN THE FACILITY AND CAUSING A SIGNIFICANT- CONTRIBUTION OF POLLUTION INTO. A WATERWAY AND SO WHERE THERE IS THE EVIDENCE FOR THAT THAT IS WHERE THE STATE WATER BOARD USING THEIR DISCRETION WOULD. THIS WOULD BE- BASICALLY TAKEN ALL OF L. A. COUNTY YEP ALL OF EVERY COUNTY. THE OTHER WORDS- EVERY COUNTY THAT HAS A PARKING LOT GREATER THAN FIVE ACRES WHICH IS CERTAINLY ALL OF THE- URBAN COUNTIES IN SUBURBAN COUNTIES- YOU KNOW MAYBE THAT ALPINE BUT JUST ABOUT EVERYWHERE ELSE. SO IT'S FACILITY THE FACILITY AND SO NOT A GRAND TOTAL OF FIVE ACRES FOR THAT COUNTY BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE COUNTY THAT'S GOING TO BE UNDER THE PERMIT IT'S THE INDIVIDUAL INDIVIDUAL COMMERCIAL FOR SORT OF WHAT I'M SAYING IS YOU'RE ANTICIPATING A BIG BAG. EVERYBODY IN THE STATE IT'S CERTAINLY GOING TO HAVE TO RESPOND TO THIS ANYONE WHO IS UNDER IT IS THAT CORRECT OR CAN THE WATER BOARD SAY WELL WILL CONCENTRATE ON THIS FIRST- THAT FIRST OR- WHAT WHAT'S GOING ON. I TO VISUALIZE IT THE FOR THE REASON WE GAVE THE STATE BOARD DISCUSSION IS SO THAT THEY CAN DECIDE WHAT'S THE MOST APPROPRIATE IF THERE IS A LARGE GROUP OF FOLKS THAT ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FOLKS THAN THEY CAN DIVIDE THE FIND THE PERMIT TO. OR THEY COULD DO A TIERED APPROACH AND GET THE LARGEST POLLUTERS IN THE GREATEST FACILITIES FIRST AND THEN AND TEAR IT UP- IT'S REALLY UP TO SUPPORT THEY COULD GO THROUGH IT YOU KNOW THIS IS A CRITICAL DATA. DRAINAGE BASIN SO WILL DO THIS ONE FIRST. THEY CAN DO THAT CORRECT OKAY SO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO SAY EVERY FACILITY IN THE STATE. HAS TO SUDDENLY HE- DO SOMETHING. WELL IT'S A STATE WIDE PERMIT BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO ASK IT FROM EVERYONE. THE STATEWIDE PERMIT FORM. WHAT DATE THEY COULD CONCENTRATE ON PARTICULAR DRAINAGE BASINS WHICH WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN LA CORRECT AND I MEAN AND THAT'S WHY WE TRY TO KEEP IT HIGH LEVEL IN KNOTS TIED THE WATER BOARD'S HAND WE WANTED THEM TO DISCUSSION TO HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY. SO WHAT ADDITIONAL SO IF THIS BILL PASSES WHAT ADDITIONAL. EITHER POWER OR- A REQUIREMENT GOES ON TO THE WATER BOARD ARE THESE THINGS THAT THEY COULDN'T DO WITHOUT THIS BILL OR THE FACING THINGS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE FORCED TO DO WITH THIS BILL. SO THEY HAVE THE WATER BOARD HAVE THE AUTHORITY UNDER THE CLEAN WATER ACT THAT IF THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THERE'S A SET THAT UP FACILITY CAUSES A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION OF POLLUTION. THE COURT NOW SAYS THEY HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED THROUGH A PERMIT AND THAT'S THE SECTIONS WE REFERENCE IN THE LEGISLATION. AND FROM THERE THE- THAT'S ESSENTIALLY IT IN THE STATE WOULD CREATE THE PERMIT- THE AND THE PERMIT WOULD LIKELY HAVE. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MONITORING THAT WOULD ONLY OCCUR IF THEY PICK THE ONE OPTION OF COMPYING WITH THEIR WATER QUALITY STANDARDS ON SITE- IT JUST DEPENDS ON HOW THEY- DETERMINE THE PERMIT BUT THE WATER BOARD'S THEMSELVES WOULDN'T BE RESTRICTED IN ANY WAY. YOU KNOW THERE ARE FORTY DOESN'T CHANGE IN ANY WAY THIS REALLY IS TRYING TO SET A PRIORITY OF. THESE ARE VERY LARGE CONTRIBUTING- STORMWATER POLLUTANT POLLUTERS AND YET RIGHT NOW THERE UNADDRESSED AND SO REALLY IT'S SETTING A PRIORITY FOR THE STATE WATER BOARD TO ADDRESS THAT OF THE STATE WATER BOARD NOW HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DO THIS. AND YOU'RE GOING TO REQUIRE THEM TO DO IT. THAT'S CORRECT. YEAH I THINK THAT'S FAIR OKAY. SO GIVEN AND I KNOW THE PEOPLE ON THE STATE WATER BOARD THEY REALLY CARE ABOUT THE PURITY OF OUR WATER WHY AREN'T THEY DOING IT NOW. I THINK IT'S SO WHEN THIS FIRST CAME UP SO WE PETITIONED THE EPA MOM AND I WORK IN THE REASONS WHY BUT WE WERE GOING TO THE EPA NOT THE STATE WATER BOARD TO DO THIS THE EPA AGREED WITH OUR POSITION THAT THESE WERE LARGE CONTRIBUTORS OF POLLUTION BUT THEY DECIDED NOT TO GIVE A PERMIT BECAUSE THEY FELT THEY WERE THE MUNICIPAL PERMIT QUITE FRANKLY WOULD BE THE ONE TO HANDLE IT. AND THAT'S WHEN WE DID THE COURT CASE AND THE JUDGE SAID NO IF YOU DO FIND THEIR LARGE CONTRIBUTORS YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM A PERMIT AND SO WE'VE BEEN CHUBB JUST STARTING WITH LOS ANGELES ALMOST AS A TEST CASES TO SEE HOW IT WORKS BUT AGAIN WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE STATEWIDE IN EVERY REGION THAT THESE ARE LARGE CONTRIBUTORS AND SO. IN FACT THIS REPORT MADE A JOKE ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN THIS FIRST HAPPENED AND THEY SAID- YOU KNOW WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO DO A STATEWIDE ORDER BECAUSE NGOS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO PETITION BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE EVIDENCE UP AND DOWN THE STATE AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE WE'RE COMING FROM WE DON'T WANT TO PETITION EVERY REGIONAL BOARD TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS AND DO A MALL INDIVIDUALLY WE FEEL LIKE THIS IS A MORE RESPONSIBLE AND LAID OUT APPROACH EVEN IF WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE- YOU KNOW EVERY BIT OF IT TO FIND IN THE LEAD. THIS THE SATURDAY SO I AM GIVING A BETTER FEELING FOR WHAT'S GOING ON HERE SO THE FACT THAT THE CHAMBER DOESN'T LIKE FAT PEOPLE CAN SUE THEY'RE SUING ALREADY AND THEY ALREADY HAVE THE ABILITY TO CALL AHEAD IF I COULD JUST RESPOND BRIEFLY TO THAT I THINK THE KEY DIFFERENCE HERE IS THAT- UNDER THE PETITION PROCESS THAT SEAN HAS OUTLINED YOU ARE SUING THE REGIONAL OR STATE WATER BOARD YOU'RE NOT SUING BY AN INDIVIDUAL. COMPANY OR PROPERTY OWNER. I YOU'RE SUING THE WATER. CORRECT I'M- AND I GUESS JUST TO PUT. IT DISCUSS THIS A LITTLE BIT FURTHER- I JUST LIKE TO YOU KNOW REITERATE OUR POSITION IS THAT YOU KNOW THE STATE WATER BOARD COULD- MAKE THIS PERMIT IF IT. OR WANTED TO AND- THE- YOU KNOW THAT MIGHT BE THE BETTER FORUM FOR US TO TALK ABOUT A LOT OF THESE ISSUES. AND WE- ARE OPPOSED TO KIND OF. DETERMINING WHICH PRIORITIES WHERE THE- WATER BOARD PUTS THEIR ENERGY AND THEIR LIMITED STAFF TIME. ESPECIALLY AS OTHER COMMENTERS MENTIONED THERE. COMING UP ON- YOU KNOW RE ISSUANCE OF EXISTING PERMITS SUCH AS THE INDUSTRIAL. AND CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER PERMITS. OKAY DO YOU AGREE WITH WHAT SHE SAID. TO A POINT SHE'S RIGHT THAT OF WHAT WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING THE PETITIONS WERE TO THE WATER AGENCIES THEMSELVES NOT A PRIVATE- INDUSTRY. THIS PERMIT IF WHEN IT GETS A DOCTOR WHEN HE GOES FOR IT IS GOING TO BE VERY SIMILAR TO THE INDUSTRIAL STORMWATER PERMIT THAT WAS REFERENCED. I WILL SAY THAT THE LET ME ADJUST THE TIMING. OF THIS YEAR THEY'RE ADJUSTING TO THE STATEWIDE PERMITS NEXT YEAR THEY'RE PLANNING ON ADDRESSING THE INDUSTRIAL PERMIT SO THAT SHOULD BE DONE BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE CERTAINLY BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. AND IF WE NEED TO WORK WITH SOME OF THE FOLKS THAT SPOKE TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PERMITS GET DONE FIRST THAT'S MY PRIORITY TO LIKE WHAT I THINK WE'RE ALL WANT THOSE TO GET DONE FIRST AND SO WE'RE HAPPY TO. TO MAKE LANGUAGE CHANGES- FOR THAT AS FOR THE PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL LAWSUITS. THERE ISN'T NECESSARILY IT THE PARENT NEEDS TO BE AN NPDES PERMIT UNDER THE CLEAN WATER ACT AND THE CLEAN MARK DOES PROVIDE FOR CITIZENS WHO PROVISIONS. BUT THE REASON WE LIKE THIS THIS THIS THE WAY THIS DIRECTION OF THE WELL IT WAS THE LOS ANGELES PERMIT IS GOING IS AGAIN THERE'S THREE COMPLIANCE OPTIONS. THERE'S THE OPTION ONE WHICH IS MEET WATER QUALITY STANDARDS AT THE END OF YOUR PROPERTY. THAT IS THE SCENARIO WHERE IF THEY WEREN'T MEETING THE STANDARDS YES THIS IS A GROUP LIKE MINE COULD BRING AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION BUT WE'RE PROVIDING. OR THE LOS ANGELES ONE IS PROVIDING HAPPY TO PUT IT IN IF IT'S NOT SO BUT THE OTHER TWO OPTIONS WHICH- ALL YOU YOU DO IT AND THERE'S NO SENSE IN PRIVATE THERE'S NO SENSE IN ENFORCEMENT AND THAT IS EITHER BUILDING STORM WATER CAPTURE ON YOUR PROPERTY AS DISCUSSED AT THE BEGINNING. OR PAYING INTO THE MUNICIPAL FUND AND ONCE YOU DO THAT YOU'RE IN COMPLIANCE THERE IS NO SAID SOME CHECKPOINTS. WE HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST FOR FIVE ACRE PARKING LOT TO. HOW MUCH THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE OVER. I'M NOT AN ENGINEER SO OB WE- I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER IS A BIT MILLIONS OR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OR TENS OF THOUSANDS. AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW DON'T ANSWER IT'S NOT IN THE MILLIONS PER PER FACILITY CERTAINLY. IT'S MORE IN THAT THE THOUSANDS- AND IT THE IDEA WOULD BE SIMILAR TO WHAT'S IN SO THIS WAS REFERENCED EARLIER. ON IN PERMITS RIGHT NOW IF YOU DO DEVELOPMENT OR REDEVELOPMENT- YOU HAVE TO BUILD A STORMWATER CAPTURE PROJECTS UP TO THE EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE STORM I WILL GET INTO ALL THAT YEAH YEAH. BUT THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN HERE EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE SO IT'S ESSENTIALLY- IF IT WAS A REDEVELOPMENT OR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IT'S THE SAME SIZE CAPTURE. ALL RIGHT. VERY GOOD. I HAVE A BETTER IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW THANK YOU- MISTER RIVAS. YOU CAN TAKE AS LONG AS YOU WANT TO CLOSE RESPECT BASS WHEN I VOTE MR WORK I HAVE- YOU KNOW I'VE APPRECIATED ALL THE ENGAGEMENT WE WORK CLOSELY WITH STEPS ARE VERY CLOSE TO THE GERMAN COMMERCE OF EXPECTED NUMBER THEIR MOMENTS WE ARE WAITING FOR SOME ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE FROM THEM- AND AS ALWAYS WE WILL ENGAGE- ANY AND ALL. BECAUSE WE CERTAINLY WANT TO GET IT RIGHT- WE WANT TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE YEAH THANK YOU DR WORK ALL RIGHT SO WE EARLIER THIS YEAR WE HELD- FORUM. OKAY WAS IT LAST YEAR AT THE FARM ON PLASTIC. JAAP PLASTIC GOING INTO THE- LOCAL- A. WATERS OCEAN WATERS IT CETERA THAT'S ONE TYPE OF POLLUTION AND OIL AND SUCH IS PROBABLY THE NEXT TYPE OF POLLUTION WERE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT. I DO THINK WE HAVE TO FIND A SOLUTION I DO THINK THAT HAVING THE STATE WIDE APPROACH TO THE PERMITTING DOES MAKE SENSE- I THINK THE BIG QUESTION IS WHEN THIS IS OUT THERE JUST HOW MUCH OF A BURDEN IT'S GOING TO BE ON THE STATE AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S THE QUESTION WE DON'T REALLY HAVE AN ANSWER TO. OUR BOT- THAT IS THE SORT OF QUESTION THAT THEY THEY LOOK AT IN APPROPRIATIONS IT'S NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS COMMITTEE. RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS COMMITTEE IS TO SAY DOES THIS MAKE SENSE FROM A CLEAN WATER POINT OF VIEW. THE DOLLARS HAS AN AWFUL LOT OF PARKING LOT IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO PAY A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY IF IT'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY TO DO THIS SO THAT IS GOING TO BE LOOKED AT AS WELL AS DO WE NEED TO REIMBURSE LOCAL CITIES AT CETERA SO I THINK THAT'S MORE OF A MATTER FOR APPROPRIATIONS I THINK THE VOTE I'M ASKING FOR HERE IS DO WE REALLY WANT TO CLEAN UP STORMWATER. THIS SEEMS TO BE THE RIGHT TIME AND THE RIGHT APPROACH TO DO IT SO I'M GOING TO ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. AND- BUT DEFINITION BEFORE IT GETS THROUGH APPROPRIATIONS AND ON TO THE FLOOR IN TERMS OF COST I THINK THAT IS CHAMBERS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AND I THINK THEY SHOULD BE AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO DO AND YOU'RE TELLING ME WILL CERTAINLY HAVE A BETTER IDEA IN THE COMING WEEKS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN LA SO I'M PREPARED TO- ASK THAT WE BRING THIS ON TO THE NEXT TO A COMMITTEE WHICH IS APPROPRIATIONS. HAVING SAID THAT THIS WILL BE A DO PASSED YOU APPROPRIATIONS MADAM SECRETARY. YEAH DID WE GET A- NUMBER OF ALL RIGHT MISTER MAYOR CG WE HAVE A SECOND YEAH ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA SECRETARY MEMBER GARCIA OKAY. VERY GOOD THIS IS ITEM NUMBER FOUR AB TWENTY ONE OH SIX ROBERT RIVAS THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS CORK HIGH COURT I SMITH NO SMITH NO ARAMBULA ARAMBULA I OUR QUE HAN ARE QUE HAND I CRISTINA GARCIA CRISTINA GARCIA I HOLDEN. HOLDEN I MATHIS. MATHIS NOT VOTING MURATSUCHI WHAT I TO GI WALDRON PASS OKAY I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR REALLY GETTING INTO THIS BILL. ONE THAT. TO MY MIND IT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WE CAN DO. AND- THERE'S- I TRUST MR RIVAS WILL LA AND MISTER BOSWELL WILL- DO A GREAT JOB GETTING THIS THROUGH APPROPRIATIONS DOWN TO THE FLOOR SO THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH MISTER REAVIS YOU'RE NOT SURE L. MISTER CHAIR KANAI. YEAH I MEAN THE COMMITTEES BEEN. INVOKED A COUPLE OF TIMES AND I JUST I VOTED FOR IT BUT WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO. AS THE CHAIR HAD OUTLINED AS THE COMMITTEE RIGHT MOOSE'S JURISDICTION WILL LOOK AT IT THROUGH A DIFFERENT SENSE OF OURS YEAH WE REALLY DO NEED TO LOOK AT THE COST AND I'M HOPING WE WILL. GET THAT THROUGH APPROPRIATIONS SENATE THAT'S FOR ME TO. OKAY. YES SO THAT TRUE LOS YES MISTER WAS CHAIR OF A PROBE I PUT LOT OF HE HAS A LOT OF WORK TO DO. AND HE WHAT HE SAID IS A YES VOTE HERE ISN'T THE SAME AS A YES VOTE TO APPROPRIATIONS. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT BEING ON APPROPRIATIONS MYSELF. AND I WILL CERTAINLY LISTEN TO WHAT MR HOLDEN TELLS ME. ALL RIGHT- CHAU TWENTY ONE OH WAIT MISTER REAVIS- WATER POLICY ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE DISADVANTAGED AND TRIBAL COMMUNITY REPRESENTATION ARE YOU MISS BASS YOU CAN BE TESTIFYING AGAIN I GUESS I AM THEN JUST A FAIR OKAY. AND THERE'S ROOM THERE'S ROOM FOR MORE. WHITE WHY GET UP AND DOWN WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO. THANKS AGAIN- THE STAFF FOR THE ANALYSIS- DOCTOR QUICK APPRECIATE UP 280% THIS BILL IT'S ASSEMBLY BILL TWO ONE ZERO EIGHT WHICH SEEKS TO ELEVATE THE VOICES. OF COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN EXCLUDED FROM WATER POLICY DECISIONS BY DESIGNATING ONE SEAT ON THE STATE AND REGIONAL WATER BOARDS TO BE FILLED BY AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE OR A TRIBAL COMMUNITY MEMBER. SUCH A STATION ALSO SEEKS TO INCORPORATE ENVIRONMENT JUSTICE ANALYSIS INTO THE APPROVAL PROCESS FOR MAJOR WATER PERMITS YOU KNOW THIS YEAR AS I MENTIONED- HOW DO. YOU KNOW IN THE- IN THE PREVIOUS ITEM MARKS THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PASSAGE OF THE FEDERAL CLEAN WATER ACT AND ON THIS FIFTIETH YEAR ANNIVERSARY MANY LOW INCOME HOUSING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. STILL LACK ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER UNDER RESOURCE DOESN'T COMMUNITIES. ARE HOME TO LOW INCOME WORKERS WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO LACK RESOURCES A LACK THE TIME. AND LIKE THE ACCESS TO ADVOCATE AGAINST POLICIES THAT HARM THEIR COMMUNITIES RESULTING IN IN AT SOME DECADES OF NEGLECT. CURRENTLY THERE ARE NO SEATS RESERVED FOR A MEMBER FROM ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE OR A TRIBAL- A COMMUNITY BACKGROUND ON OUR STATE AND REGIONAL WATER BOARDS. AND WHILE THE CURRENT BOARD HAS TAKEN SOME PROACTIVE STEPS TO IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENT JUSTICE OUTCOMES- WE MUST ENSURE THAT OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE MOVING FORWARD. ADDITIONALLY THIS LEGISLATION WOULD REQUIRE COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT I AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE POLICY SOME CONSIDERATIONS FOR MAJOR WATER PERMITS BUT THE STATE REGIONAL WATER BOARDS ISSUE THERE WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY ARE- AERIAL ASSAULT THE BAR- ON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY WATER. CENTER ALSO- HERE TESTIFY IS CAITLYN SIS ON BEHALF OF THE- WEINMAN. A WINDOW TRY. THANK YOU MR. RIGHT WHO WILL SPEAK FIRST THEN. TICKETS ARE CHECKED OF THANK YOU CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS LYDIA SULLIVAN AND I'M WITH THE COMMITTEE WATER CENTER WHO IS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY ONE ZERO EIGHT BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER PREVIOUS BOB THIS BILL REPRESENTS A CRITICAL TOOL FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE. NINE WATER INEQUITIES SPECIFICALLY BY ENSURING THAT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE DURING CRITICAL WATER POLICY DECISIONS. AND ENSURING THAT MAY INCLUDE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ANALYSIS- WITH IN THOSE DECISIONS BOTH OF THESE WILL FURTHER THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO THE CORRECT WATER WHERE WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO. DO STILL IN FACT A MILLION CALIFORNIANS DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER WHEN THEY OPEN THE TAP. NOW THE STATE WATER BOARD WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN AND TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE. GOVERNOR NEWSOM WAS ACTUALLY THE FIRST GOVERNOR TO APPOINT A REPRESENTATIVE TO THE STATE WATER BOARD WITH A BACKGROUND IN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE- THAT MEMBER WAS LARA FIRESTONE. COFOUNDER OF THE CLEAN WATER CENTER WHO WAS APPOINTED IN TWENTY NINETEEN. MEANING THAT AFTER FIFTY TWO YEARS THESE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES FINALLY HAD- AND THAT. THAT'S THE DECISION MAKER ON THE STATE WATER BOARD WITH A PROVEN TRACK RECORD FOR ADVOCATE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. AB TWENTY ONE ZERO EIGHT ENSURES THAT TYPE OF REPRESENTATION REMAINS AND I FUTURE GOVERNORS ALSO PROVIDE MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES WITHOUT REPRESENTATION AT THE STATE WATER BOARD AND THE REGIONAL FORCE BECAUSE THEIR DECISIONS IMPACT. DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THE MOST IT'S ALSO POINTED OUT THE AB TWENTY ONE ZERO EIGHT DOES NOT REPLACE ANY OF THE EXISTING WATER BOARD SEATS. AND THAT THE BILL'S LANGUAGE IS ACTUALLY DENTICLE TO EXISTING THATCHER RELATING TO THE STATE WATER BOARD REQUIRING ONE MEMBER TO BE A- QUALIFIED REPRESENTATIVE FROM AGRICULTURAL INTERESTS- IF AGRICULTURAL INTERESTS K. GUARANTEED REPRESENTATION AT THE STATE WATER BOARD FOR THEIR DECISIONS WHY SHOULD THE COMMUNITY. THAT ARE MOST DEEPLY IMPACTED BY WATER POLLUTION HAVE EQUAL REPRESENTATION FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS THANK YOU. VERY GOOD AND OUR NEXT WITNESS- MISTER SISK- HE'S ON THE PHONE OKAY MISTER CISCO PLEASE- SPEAK UP. YEAH THANK YOU CARE FOR ANY MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KELLY SAYS AND I'M THE CHIEF AND SPIRITUAL LEADER OF THE MINIMUM. I'VE BEEN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. IN OUR NAME MEANS MIDDLE WATER PEOPLE. WATER AND FAMILY ARE AT THE CENTER OF OUR HISTORY AND OUR CULTURE AND OUR RELIGION. I HEARD YOU DO SUPPORT AB TWENTY ONE OH EIGHT ONE. OUR TRIBE. OUR TRIBE'S CULTURE IS THREATENED BY POOR WATER MANAGEMENT STATE REGIONAL WATER BOARD DECISIONS ABOUT TEMPERATURE. MANAGEMENT WATER RIGHTS WATER FLOWS AND WATER QUALITY HAVE BEEN BIG. I'VE BEEN A BIG IMPACT ON OUR PEOPLE AND OUR SALMON. AB TWENTY ONE. WOULD DO THREE THINGS. IT WOULD GIVE ALL TRIBES. FEDERAL RECOGNIZE YOU'RE NOT REPRESENTATION. BY REQUIRING AT LEAST ONE MEMBER. OF THE STATE MORE REGIONAL WATER BOARDS TO HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH OUR TRAVEL ISSUES. IT WOULD FIRE STATE AND EGIONAL WATER BOARDS TO GIVE ALL OUTRAGE THEY BOYS AND REMOVE BARRIERS THAT PREVENT US FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE DECISION THAT AFFECT. PROVIDE MORE OPENNESS AND AN ANALYSIS TO DECISION MAKERS AND DECISIONS THAT AFFECT. US IN THE FUTURE TRAVEL GENERATION THAN VILLAGES THE WATER ENGINEERS WATER RIGHT REPRESENTED ON THE WATER BOARD FOR DECADES THAT HAS MEANT THAT THE POLLUTERS ARE GUARANTEED TO VOTE ON STATE WATER BOARD BUT THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND TRIBES ARE MOST AFFECTED BY WATER BOARD DECISIONS ARE NOT GUARANTEED A VOTE CURRENTLY TRIBES THERE MOST UNDER REPRESENTED IN STATE WATER DECISION. GOVERNOR NATHAN HAS PLEDGED TO CHANGE CALIFORNIA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH CALIFORNIANS. AB TWENTY ONE OH EIGHT SHOWS HOW BOARD CUT BACK OF THE 20% BETTER THAN TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT- TRAVEL COMMUNITIES ARE ALREADY AT BARE MINIMUM WATER USE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE LONG BEEN HELLO ALL OF THOSE KINDS OF THINGS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. 20% BACK YUP WE'VE GONE OVER THE FOUR MINUTES OCT IF YOU COULD SUMMARIZE. YES I DO WANT YOU TO THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY ASK FOR THE PRIMARY WITNESS IN OPPOSITION WHICH IS MISS BASS AGAIN. RIGHT I THINK THERE'S ANOTHER PRIMARY WITNESS AND OBSERVATION AS WELL SO YEAH ALMOST BASS HE VERY TIME ARE GOING TO BE THE TIMELY WILL ALSO HEAR FROM ROBERT READ THAT LAST FOR SOME REASON YOU WANT HIM TO GO FIRST. I'M I CAN GO FIRST I GUESS SINCE I'M UP HERE AND THEN- GET OUT OF YOUR HAIR. SIX OF GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN THANK YOU. SURE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- AGAIN I AM GOING TO PASS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND- WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB TWENTY ONE OH EIGHT UNLESS AMENDED- BUT WE ARE STILL EVALUATING SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT CAME IN AFTER OUR LETTER WAS SUBMITTED AND WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO FURTHER COULDN'T THAT DISCUSSIONS IN THIS BILL. AND THIS BILL HAS MANY PROVISIONS THAT ARE SO I'M JUST GOING TO KIND OF HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF OUR MAIN CONCERNS AND I WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT THE COMING OUT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS NOTES THAT THE STATE WATER BOARD ADOPTED A RESOLUTION I NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT COMMITTED THE BOARD TO CAREFULLY CONSIDERING IMPACTS TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. SO THIS IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER EXISTING LAWS THAT REQUIRE PUBLIC NOTICE AND PARTICIPATION OPPORTUNITIES MAKE MANY OF THE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL IN OUR VIEW- I NECESSARY OF THE BILL ALSO WOULD IMPOSE. NEW COSTS THAT WE THINK ARE LIKELY TO BE BORNE BY REGULATED ENTITIES IN THE FORM OF INCREASED PERMIT FEES SO AS WE HEARD THE BILL IMPOSES NEW ANALYSIS AND MITIGATION REQUIREMENTS- IN THE WATER BOARD'S PLANNING AND PERMITTING PROCESSES AND OUT SPECIFICALLY IN GEN THREE OF THE BILL REQUIRES THAT THE WATER BOARD'S CONSIDERING MITIGATING- INTERMODAL JUSTICE IMPACTS EARLY IN THE PROJECT PLANNING PROCESS SEES WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE WHICH PROJECTS THIS WOULD APPLY TO. THE WORLD AND SIR BUT THIS CREATE OVERLAP SEE WHAT IN TERMS OF ANALYSIS AND MITIGATION AND THAT MEANS THAT FOR PROJECTS THAT OTHERWISE SUBJECT TO SEE WHAT- IT ADDED TO GET STAFF IT ATTENTION SO WHAT I'M PROJECT. EIGHT BEST TENSION. IS KNOW ARE SERIOUS IMPACTS WITH A WHITE. I IN THE RECENT YOU SEE BURKE. CASE OVER THE SECTION FOR THE CREATE POSITIONS WITHIN THE WATER. AND EAST IN PRO FOR. I'M CERTAIN COMMUNITIES PARTICIPATE FOR THE Y. BOARD'S AND WE'RE NOT SURE HOW THIS IS GOING TO BE PAID FOR- AND WE THINK A PERSON THE RED THAT PERMIT FEES WILL BE INCREASED TO COVER THE NEW PROGRAM AND STAFF POSITIONS. WHICH ULTIMATELY CAN RESULT IN THE PERMITS HE THEN ARE RAISING RATES TO COVER COSTS WHICH OF COURSE THEN TRICKLES DOWN TO THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIAN IN THE TERMS OF. OUR INCREASED COSTS FOR WATER WASTEWATER WHAT HAVE YOU- WE ALSO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL THAT WOULD RESTRICT THE GOVERNOR'S ABILITY TO APPOINT PERSONS TO SERVE ON THE STATE AND I REGIONAL WATER BOARDS AND I DID WANT TO NOTE. THAT THERE ARE NO AG STEEP SET ASIDES ON THE NINE AND REGIONAL WATER BOARDS- SO THIS TIME WE MUST RETAIN OUR- PROPOSED UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THIS BILL WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME FOR THIS. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU FOR YOUR CLEAR PRESENTATION AND YOUR CONCERNS- MYSTERY. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY CLIENT ELSE FOR THE DELETION OF PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL THAT MANDATE THE APPOINTMENT OF PERSONS WHO HAVE A PROVEN HISTORY. OF ADVOCATING FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. JUSTICE FOR TRAVEL RIGHTS OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THIS ADVOCACY ROLES IN CONSISTENT WITH STATE LAW ON POLICIES. RELATING TO WATER RIGHTS AND WATER QUALITY. SINCE ITS CREATION IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN STATE BOARD HAS FILED ITS ORIGINAL MANDATE TO BALANCE. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE ALL USES OF CALIFORNIA'S WATER RESOURCES INTO ENSURE THE REASONABLE PROTECTION A BENEFICIAL USES IN THE PREVENTION OF NUISANCE. STATE POLICY PROVIDES THAT THE GRANTING OF WATER RIGHTS IN THE DISPOSAL OF WASTES INTO THE WATERS OF THE STATE. SHALL BE REGULATED ACHIEVE THE HIGHEST WATER QUALITY CONSISTENT WITH MAXIMUM BENEFIT TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE IN OTHER WORDS THE STATE BOARD HAS A DUTY TO REPRESENT THE BEST INTERESTS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. SECOND THERE ARE MULTIPLE LAWS REGULATIONS AND POLICIES THAT ENSURE THAT THE NEEDS OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE MET BY THE ENTIRE STATE BOARD. AS WELL AS THE REGIONAL BOARD. CALIFORNIA HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER LAWS BEEN MENTIONED AS ONE. THE SAFER PROGRAM IS ANOTHER WHICH FLOWED OUT OF SB TWO HUNDRED BY FORMER SENATORS- BILL MONEY IN- THAT- IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE CALIFORNIANS WHO LACK SAFE ADEQUATE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER RECEIVE IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. SAFER ACCORDING TO THE STATE BOARD AND I QUOTE MINIMIZES THE DISPROPORTIONATE ENVIRONMENTAL BURDENS EXPERIENCED BY SOME COMMUNITIES ADVANCES JUSTICE FOR PEOPLE OF ALL INCOMES RACES AND CULTURES. BOTH THE DRINKING WATER AND CLEAN WATER INTENDED USE PLANS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT CONTINUE TO STRESS HELPING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SOLVE THEIR DRINKING WATER PROBLEMS PRIORITIZE SEPTIC TO SEWER CONVERSIONS. AND FURTHER SPECIFY THAT UP 210% OF AVAILABLE FUNDS MAY BE UTILIZED FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND CAPACITY BUILDING AND DAX. FINALLY IT'S STATE WATER BOARD RESOLUTION WHICH AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY STATES THAT THE SHARED MISSION OF THE BOARD THE NINE REGIONAL BOARDS IS TO PRESERVE ENHANCE AND RESTORE THE QUALITY OF CALIFORNIA'S. WATER RESOURCES AND DRINKING WATER FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT PUBLIC HEALTH AND ALL BENEFICIAL USES. AND TO ENSURE PROPER WATER RESOURCE ALLOCATION AND FISHING USE FOR THE BENEFIT OF PRESENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS. RELATIONS MISSION THE WATER BOARDS HAVE ACCEPTED RESPONSIBILITY FOR CONFRONTING STRUCTURAL INSTITUTIONAL RACISM- YOUR WAY OVER COULD YOU- FORTUNATELY I WAS DISTRACTED- COULD YOU JUST SOMEBODY SEVERAL ALSO IF YOU'RE AT LIBERTY TO TELL US WHO YOUR CLIENT IS GET THE VALLEY ATWATER COALITION WE'VE- COMMUNICATE WITH COMMITTEE I'M SORRY. WITH TWO MINUTES I TRY NOT TO TAKE UP TIME THAT SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU CAN JUST SUMMARIZING YOUR SO IN CLOSING- YOU KNOW THE WORK OF THE STATE BOARD IS NOT TO- TO DETERMINE WINNERS OR LOSERS AND THEIR DECISIONS AND THEIR ORDERS ARE. VERY CHALLENGING AND QUITE OFTEN- DON'T MEET WITH THE SATISFACTION OF ANY OF THE PARTIES. WE THINK THIS BILL WOULD MAKE THAT EVEN. WORSE IN TERMS OF THE WORK OF THE STATE BOARD WITH GROUP RESPECTFULLY REQUEST A NO VOTE ABSENT THE AMENDMENT THAT THE CLIENT SIX THANK YOU SIR. OKAY OTHERS IN THE ROOM FIRST WHO WOULD- SPEAK IN SUPPORT. HELLO AGAIN MY NAME IS CODY PHILLIPS- AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF SEVENTH GENERATION ADVISORS THE MONO THEY COMMITTEE- THE SURFRIDER FOUNDATION AND CLEAN WATER ACTION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MICHAEL CLAIBORNE- A DIRECTING ATTORNEY WITH LEADERSHIP COUNSEL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THEN ANYONE IN THE ROOM WHO WAS SUPPOSED. SKAPSKI THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR DON KHAKI ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC BALANCE AND STEVE IS RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE PHONES. AND WE'LL HEAR FROM ANYONE WHO IS EITHER OPPOSED OR IN FAVOUR. AND PLEASE JUST GIVE US YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION AND YOUR POSITION THANK YOU. MR OPERATOR. AND WE'LL START WITH ONE NUMBER SIXTY TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD KEITH STREET CONSULTING ON BEHALF OF THE TALK SHE TRIED IN SUPPORT. THE NEXT ONE SIXTY FIVE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS JUDY HUGHES IN THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF THE PROJECT PRODUCER'S REPRESENTATIVE PROFIT IN A CALIFORNIA- IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. TO MOVE ON THE LINE FORTY SEVEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON OF ANNUALLY ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. WE GO TO ONE SIXTY EIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON CARE MEMBERS ARE BACK ABOUT INVOLVED BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RIGHT COMMISSION THE CALIFORNIA FRESH FRUIT ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA COTTON GENERATION GROWERS ASSOCIATION WESTERN PLANT HEALTH ASSOCIATION AND WESTERN AGRICULTURAL PROCESSORS ASSOCIATION WITH AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE CAN QUEUE AT THIS TIME SHARE. RIGHT THEN MEMBERS WITH QUESTIONS THANK YOU GO AHEAD I JUST HAVE ONE M. QUICK COMMENT AND HIGHLIGHT FOR THE AUTHOR WHICH IS- THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS YOU KNOW SINCE TAKING ON THE CHAIR OF WATER PARKS AND WILDLIFE AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK SOCIALLY WITH OUR NATIVE PEOPLE AND HOW LEFT OUT THERE ARE FROM THE CONVERSATIONS BUT THAT'S TRUE FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AS WELL SO I THINK THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT WORK ONE THING I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT IN THE BILL IS THAT. YOU RECOMMEND THAT THE WATER BOARD USE CALAVERAS GREEN TO ADVERTISE COMMUNITIES AS I THINK YOU KNOW IT'S NEVER THE BAY AREA CAUCUS IT IS A CALCULATION THAT OFTEN LEAVES DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THE BAY AREA OUT AND SO I HOPE WE CAN LOOK AT THAT PIECE TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE LEFT BEHIND WILL BE INCLUDED AS WELL THANK YOU. FOR THE SUGGESTION YEAH ABSOLUTELY. JOHN I'LL JUST ADD CALLIN VIRUS BRAIN LOOKS AT ERIC. THIS IS A WATER ISSUE. SO I DON'T THINK KALAN VIRUS GREEN IS APPROPRIATE I THINK THAT'S A- GOOD POINT. MISS BARRICADE AND- ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT. ALRIGHT LEVINE SECONDED- SO WE STILL HAVE. YOU STILL HAVE QUESTIONS AS TO HOW THIS WOULD BE FUNDED I WOULD BE VERY SURPRISED IF IT'S ANYTHING OTHER THAN- PERMIT HE'S HAVING TO DO IT I DON'T SEE IT COMING FROM THE GENERAL FUND SO I THINK. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT AGAIN MISTER CHAIRMAN PREPARATIONS WILL HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT. HE AND THEN THIS IS THE WATER QUALITY COMMITTEE THE WATER QUANTITY COMMITTEE CHAIRS RIGHT OVER HERE MISS POWER K. HAND SHE SHE WILL BE LOOKING IT'S JUST BEEN REFERRED TO HER COMMITTEE AS WELL SO- YOU'RE YOU'RE GONNA GET- HOW CAN I SAY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES. OF FROM A THE SAME MEMBERS WHO MAY VOTE YES HERE BUT MAY HAVE OTHER RESERVATIONS IN THEIR OWN COMMITTEES. SO AGAIN FROM A WATER QUALITY POINT OF VIEW I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS HERE IS PROPOSING TO SAY THAT TRIBES- HAVEN'T BEEN NEGLECTED I KNOW THAT. THE OPPOSITION WAS SAYING WELL THIS IS REQUIRED ALREADY. I DON'T THINK THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT- COMMUNITIES ARE LOW INCOME AND- TRAVEL COMMUNITIES BEEN TREATED FAIRLY. SO I DO THINK. TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST. NO FEEDBACK ALL RIGHT MISTER CHANG. NO I KNOW THAT THE- SO THIS IS. PERHAPS I DON'T. AM LOOKING FOR Y. OKAY SO THIS IS PRODUCT SAFETY TEXTILES AND PROFESS ONE OF YOUR FAVORITE TOPICS BE FAST. SO WE HAVE- MY PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL WHICH ARE IN THE ANALYSIS IN THE BEEN PASSED AROUND TO MEMBERS AND LEDGE COUNCIL FORM. WHETHER BEING PASSED NOW. BUT THESE MEMBERS WILL COLOR FIGHT EXEMPTIONS TO THE P. FAST PROHIBITIONS IN THE BILL. THE FIRST IS FOR PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. AND THE SECOND IS FOR AFTERMARKET TREATMENTS FOR TEXTILES BECAUSE THOSE PRODUCTS ARE CURRENTLY REGULATED UNDER THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM AT THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL. OUT YOU CHECK THESE AMENDMENTS ABSOLUTELY I JUST WANNA THANK YOU AND THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US ON THOSE AMENDMENTS ALL RIGHT YOU MAY START TO PRESENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WHEN IT'S WORKING WONDERFUL- IN JUST SO YOU KNOW WE GOT SIX VOTES FOR THE LAST BILL MISTER REDUCES. TWENTY ONE THIRTEEN. WHAT WONDERFUL SO AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTEEN IS THE SAFER CLOTHES AND TEXTILES ACT IT BUILDS UPON A NUMBER OF BILLS I'VE CARRIED AROUND KEY FAST OVER THE LAST. FEW YEARS A. B. AT EIGHTEEN SEVENTEEN- WOULD BAN THE SALE OF TEXTILES THAT CONTAIN P. FAST BY TWENTY TWENTY FOR THE BILL'S GOING TO PHASE OUT P. FAST IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF TEXTILE APPLICATIONS- BUT GIVEN THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCT PROGRAMS WORK IT'LL EXCLUDE CARPETS. RUGS AND AFTERMARKET TREATMENT THAT ALSO MAKE EXCEPTIONS FOR PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AS WELL AS SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT USED IN FIREFIGHTING- P. FAST AS WE KNOW IN THIS COMMITTEE. IT'S A VERY DANGEROUS FOREVER CHEMICAL GETS INTO OUR WATER SYSTEM- CURRENTLY. IF WE LOOK OUT OF OUT OF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT ACTIVE PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS THAT ARE TESTED 65% HAPPY FAST THE TICKET OF THEM WHICH IS A NUMBER OF FILE WHICH SERVES ABOUT SIXTEEN MILLION PEOPLE IN TOTAL. AND IF YOU TALK TO A VARIETY OF TEXTILE. MANUFACTURES READY MANY COMPANIES HAVE ALREADY DECIDED TO PHASE OUT OR WILL BE PHASING OUT P. FAST. OF FOOTWEAR COMPANY SKECHERS KEEN PUMA NIKE. VF WHICH IS. THE PARENT BRAND FOR NORTH FACE AND TIMBERLAND. LEVI'S AND M. GAP. IN THE TAX WHICH IS THE PARENT COMPANY OF ZARA TO GET THAT RIGHT MR CARE. JACK WILL SCAN FOLDER SKEWS ME- JACK WILL SCAN POLITECNICA PATAGONIA VF OSPREY DAUGHTER DOUTOR SKEWS ME I KIA- AND TARGET AND SO YOU CAN SEE. THE PRIVATE INDUSTRY IS ALREADY STARTING TO LEAD THE WAY ON THIS ISSUE KNOWING THAT WE WANT TO KEEP UP P. FAST OUT OF FAR- WATER STREET IN PARTICULAR- IN TERMS OF CLOTHING IF YOU WASH YOUR CLOTHING THAT HAS P. FAST pAS WELL AS IF YOU WEAR P. FASTENER RANGE YOU CAN GET INTO THE WATER STREAM AS WELL SO WITHOUT HAVE TO WITNESSES- ABI KERR. SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH NRDC AND DR LAURA CIDER WHO'S A SENIOR RESEARCH SCIENTIST AT FIVE AND SPRING BOTH ARE ON THE PHONE. VERY GOOD- SHOW WE WILL NOW HEAR FROM. WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK FIRST DOCTOR SCHNEIDER. FOR THE CARD FROM AN IT ON THAT THE FIRST IS THAT CAN'T. GO AHEAD. YEAH TO CHECK WORKING MA'AM AND BACK BUT YEAH TO SPEAK HI MY NAME IS ARGHA KAR ON THE AND TRACK FOR HELP FOOD AND NATIONAL DEFENSE GOT. AND I SEE THAT BY. BOB ENTITY SEVENTEEN THE BACK.

WE HAVE THE AYE ABOUT EIGHTY EIGHTY. THANK YOU. VERY GOOD I NEXT WILL HEAR FOR- LARA SCHRADER FROM SOME SPRING. GO AHEAD. HEY GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR CHOIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS THING YOU FOR THE PROPER TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY I'M LAUREL SHADER AND A SENIOR SCIENTIST AT SILENT SPRING INSTITUTE WITH A PHD IN ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING FROM UC BERKELEY SILENT SPRING IS AN INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT RESEARCH ORGANIZATION THAT INVESTIGATES LINKS BETWEEN EVERYDAY CHEMICALS IN PUBLIC HEALTH I CURRENTLY LEAD THREE FEDERALLY FUNDED STUDIES ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL TRANSPORT EXPOSURE AND HELP PROTECT THE PIZZA. I'D LIKE TO SHARE THREE KEY POINTS RELATED TO BE FASTENED TEXTILE BASED ON MY OWN RESEARCH AND OTHER PUBLISHED RESEARCH STUDIES FIRST THE FACT THAT ARE COMMON IN TEXTILE BASED CONSUMER PRODUCTS SILENT SPRING RECENTLY TESTED FOR P. FAST IN NEARLY ONE HUNDRED TEXTILE PRODUCTS INCLUDING APPAREL BEDDING AND FURNISHINGS WE SELECTED PRODUCTS THE CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS HAVE FREQUENT CONTACT WITH SUCH AS SCHOOL UNIFORMS AND CHILDREN'S BEDDING. TOTAL FOREIGN WHICH OF AN AND OF P. FAST WAS DETECTED IN 65% OF PRODUCTS MARKETED TO STAY IN OUR WATER RESISTANT. EVEN STAIN AND WATER RESISTANT PRODUCTS LABELED AS GREEN ARE NONTOXIC HAD DETECTABLE LEVELS OF PIZZA. OUR FINDINGS UNDERSCORE THAT INFORMATION ON PRODUCT LABEL CANNOT BE USED BY CONSUMERS TO IDENTIFY P. FAST THREE ITEMS. SECOND TWO THOUSAND TEXTILE POLLUTE OUR BODIES IN ENVIRONMENT. HE FOUND DO NOT REAL REMAINING PRODUCT THEY MIGRATED TO INDOOR AIR AND THAT'S WHERE WE CAN BREED THEM AND- IN JAFFNA. THEY MAY COME OFF ON OUR SKIN FROM DIRECT CONTACT. DURING WASHING THEY CAN END UP IN WASTE WATER. IN OVERTIME THEY CAN BE RELEASED FROM DISCARDED PRODUCTS AND END UP IN LANDFILL LEACHATE. WITHOUT HARM COMMUNITIES CLOSE TO MANUFACTURING PLANTS AND INCINERATORS THAT HANDLE P. FAST WAYS. EXACERBATING ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICE. AND FINALLY HE GOT THERE NEED TO BE IN TEXTILES. IN OUR STUDY 35% OF TEXTILES LABELED AS WATER STAIN RESISTANT DID NOT HAVE P. FAST. DEMONSTRATING THAT ALTERNATIVES ALREADY EXIST. I HOPE YOU TAKE THE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION INTO ACCOUNT IF YOU CONSIDERWAYS TO ELIMINATE UNNECESSARY NONESSENTIAL USES A PIZZA. THANK YOU. VERY GOOD. AND. WE CAN NOW HEAR FROM MA. ANYONE WHO IS IN OPPOSITION DO WE HAVE SOME PRIMARY WITNESSES I SEE TÃŒM HERE WHAT YOU COME UP TO THE TABLE. PLEASE PROCEED YOU HAVE FOUR MINUTES TOTAL. HE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME AS WELL WAGNER OF ARNOLD AND PORTER AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF TEXTILE ORGANIZATIONS AND ITS MEMBERS WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION AS AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTEEN. HE FASTER A GROUP OF THOUSANDS OF CHEMICALS THAT SHARE A COMMON CHARACTERISTIC A STRONG BOND BETWEEN CARBON AND FLUORINE ATOMS. CALLED ORGANIC FLORIAN. HOWEVER THERE IS GREAT BILL VARIABILITY ACROSS P. FAST CHEMISTRY. FOR EXAMPLE SOME PEOPLE ASK OUR SOLID SUMMER LIQUID SUMMER GAS. IMPORTANTLY THE EFFECTS ON HUMANS AND THE ENVIRONMENT APPEAR TO VARY SIGNIFICANTLY. SCIENTIFIC DATA SUPPORT THAT SOME P. FAST MAY BE TOXIC LIKE LEGACY LIKE THE LEGACY COMPOUND PFOA. AND OTHER NON POLYMERIC ACIDS. HOWEVER SCIENTIFIC DATA DO NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORT THAT TOXICITY ARE BIOACCUMULATION OF OTHER CHEMICALS THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED P. FAST UNDER THE BROAD DEFINITION THIS BILL. LIKE POLYMERIC ORGANIC FLOORING COMPOUNDS. POLYMERIC P. FAST ARE GENERALLY NOT WATER SOLUBLE NOR MOBILE AND IN THE ENVIRONMENT. PAGE FIVE OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB EXPLAINING NON POLYMERIC ACIDIC P. FAST LIKE PFOA BUT DOES NOT APPEAR TO ADDRESS OTHER LESS CONCERNING CHEMISTRY LIKE THE CHEMISTRY USED BY THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY LARGELY IS BY THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY. WHICH IS THE POLYMERIC VARIATION. GIVEN THE VARIABILITY IN P. FAST EVEN EPA IS NOT PRESENTLY REGULATING P. FAST AS A CLASS. A MORE NARROW DEFINITION OF P. FAST WOULD BETTER TRACK THE SCIENCE FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY TWENTY THE LEGISATURE PASSED THE TOXIC FREE COSMETICS ACT WHICH PROHIBITED SPACE SPECIFIC PROBLEMATIC BE FAST CHEMISTRY. I'D RATHER THAN REGULATING AT ON A CLASS WIDE BASIS. THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY USES POLYMERIC ORGANIC FLOORING THIS CHEMISTRY IS ESSENTIAL AND INTRIGUING TEXTILES AND MUST BE DURABLE SUCH AS TEXTILES REPELLED OIL AND WATER. INCLUDING OUTDOOR FURNITURE HI TRAFFIC POULTRY BUILDING COVERS AN AUTOMOBILE USES THERE IS NO KNOWN VIABLE ALTERNATIVE CHEMISTRY THAT WOULD MEET THE DEMANDING PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION FOR SOME OF THESE PRODUCTS. IF THIS BILL PASSES IN ITS CURRENT FORM PROHIBITING ALL P. FASTEN TEXTILES IT IS AN INDUSTRY KILLER. SPEAKING GENERALLY TEXTILES HAVE A RELATIVELY LOWER EXPOSURE PROFILE COMPARED TO OTHER PRODUCTS THEY'RE NOT WORN ON THE BODY AND HOLD AND HUMAN CONTACT WOULD BE INTERMITTENT. TEXTILES ARE ALSO GENERALLY NOT CLEANED IN A WASHING MACHINE. IF ALL P. FASTER PROHIBITED AND TEXTILES THE INDUSTRY WILL EITHER STOP SELLING THESE QUALITY PRODUCTS IN CALIFORNIA OR OR THEY'LL BE FORCED TO USE CHEMISTRY THAT ISN'T A FACTOR. WHICH WILL CAUSE SHORTER PRODUCT LIFE INCREASE WASTE. ACCORDINGLY WE BELIEVE THE DEFINITION OF TEXTILE ARTICLES SHOULD BE NARROWED. IT IS NOTICEABLE IT IS AVAILABLE YOU'VE TAKEN THREE MINUTES WE REALLY WANT TO GIVE A MINUTE AT LEAST TO TÃŒM I JUST WANTED TO MENTION THAT THE OTHER P. FAST LEGISLATION HAS BEEN PASSED. IS REGARDING JUVENILE PRODUCTS AND FOOD PACKAGING WHERE THERE IS. OTHER POSSIBILITY OTHER CHEMISTRY AVAILABLE AND THAT'S NOT THE CASE HERE. THANK YOU MISTER CHEF BACK THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ARE COMMITTEE TEN CHESTER WITH AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL- GREAT TO SEE EVERYONE PERSON- APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS TODAY. WE RECENTLY HAD A CONSTRUCTIVE CONVERSATION WITH THAT MR THINK STAFF AND THE SPONSOR THE BILL TO DISCUSS A FEW ISSUES- THAT WE BELIEVE- NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AS THIS BILL WOULD MOVE FORWARD. IS INCLUDES A CONSISTENCY WITH DEFINITIONS FROM A PREVIOUSLY ENACTED LEGISLATION. ON THIS TOPIC- CLARITY IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE PROPOSED EXEMPTIONS WERE INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT- THAT WAS ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE- WE HAD RAISED OUR PRIOR DISCUSSION AND THE NEED TO PROVIDE FOR- AND ARGUE SOME SUFFICIENT APPLIANCE TIME. FOR A- ENTITIES AS IT WAS MENTIONED THERE WAS A BILL TWO BILLS PASSED LAST SESSION THAT DEFINED REGULATED P. FOSS THIS BILL PROPOSES A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DEFINITION- THAT IN OUR VIEW GREATLY INCREASES THE PROBABILITY THAT EVEN PRODUCTS. THAT MAY BE DESIGNED WITHOUT ANY INTENSELY ADDED P. THOUGHTS. COULD BE SUBJECT TO THE PROHIBITION- ON THE COMPLIANCE DATE OF PROVIDING JUST ONE YEAR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE- MAY POSE A CHALLENGE FOR MATERIAL SUPPLIERS- CONSUMER PRODUCT COMPANIES TO REDESIGN PRODUCTS.

MISTER CHANG AYE AYE- THIS REMINDED ME WHEN WE WERE IN COLLEGE I AS TO SPRAY MY JEANS THE SCOTCH GUARD AND WE'VE- HOPEFULLY COME A LONG WAYS- I DID AS WELL YEAH- I HAD A QUESTION OF A FIRST TO THE AND THE GENTLEMAN FROM ARNOLD AND PORTER YOU INDICATED THAT THIS WOULD BE A INDUSTRY KILLER AND YOU HAVE TO THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. NUMEROUS LEADING BRANDS THAT- THAT ARE EITHER ARE HAVE FULLY PHASED OUT OR HAVE COMMITTED THE FULL THE PHASING OUT- HOW ARE WE TO- JUSTIFY. THAT APPARENT CONTRADICTION YEAH IT IT I THINK THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION- SO THIS IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF PRODUCT THAN THOSE THAT ARE IN SUPPORT SORRY IT'S IS DIFFICULT IT TOOK IT SHOULD ANSWER- WHAT WE'RE TALKING WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT TODAY ARE PRIMARILY OUTDOOR FURNITURE HI TRAFFIC UPHOLSTERY- VOTING COVERS- I THINK OF LIKE AUTOMOBILE USES ON CONVERTIBLES WHERE THAT MATERIAL MOVES BACK SO THEY'RE ALL REALLY THE REALLY DEMANDING. THERE'S A LOT OF DEMANDING PERFORMANCE IS OFTEN EXPOSED TO THE WEATHER TO THE ELEMENTS AND IT'S EXPECTED TO LAST- THAT'S NOT THE CASE WITH CLOTHING NECESSARILY SO IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT KIND OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF PRODUCTS OKAY THANK- IT'S YOUR TEAM WITH THE WIND WAS. DID IT DID I HEAR THAT ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS WAS TO EXCLUDE- RUGS. CARPETS. OKAY YEAH I GUESS THAT WAS IT'S BECAUSE THE- DEPARTMENT OF TOXICS AND- S. SUBSTANTIVE SUBSTANCE CONTROLS IS REVIEWING THAT ALREADY OKAY THINGS ARE ABOUT THE- AND MY LAST QUESTION IS- ON ON PAGE NINE OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. WE TALK ABOUT THE- THE REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTIONS TAKING PLACE IN TERMS OF- SOMETIMES EVEN WORSE SHORT CHAIN NO NO YEAH IS IT- HOW IS THIS BILL. IS THERE A CONCERN THAT THIS BILL MAY LEAD TO WORSE OUTCOMES. I KNOW WE DON'T WE DON'T THINGS I THINK- WE ARE CALLING FROM BELL GARDENS KNOWS AND THIS IS HAPPENING I MEAN ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS WE'RE DOING THIS IS BECAUSE OF ALL THE WATER CONTAMINATION THAT'S GOING AROUND THE STATE- YOU WE HEARD THREE PREVIOUS BILLS TALKING ABOUT WATER CONTAMINATION- THAT IS ONE OF THE- MAJOR OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IN TERMS OF. BANNING THESE TEXTILES AND SO BY BY DOING SO I THINK WORK- WE'RE WE'RE MOVING TOWARD THAT GOAL OF HAVING CLEANER WATER ESPECIALLY AT A TIME WHEN WE HAVE A DROUGHT AND WE ARE VERY SCARCE WATER. WELL NOTHING GOING TO DO IS CONFIRM FURTHERCONTAMINATE OUR ARMED OUR WATER STREAMS OUR WATER SYSTEMS. I AM JUST TRYING TO. I UNDERSTAND THAT I MEAN I GET IT THAT WE- WANT TO. THERE THERE THERE THERE IS TOO MUCH TOO HIGH DETECTION OF P. FASTEN OUR WATER SUPPLY AND YET. IF THE ALTERNATIVES IMMINENT. POLICE ACCORDING TO THIS ONE ARTICLE SIDE IN THE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES ALTURAS MAY EVEN BE WORSE THAN THE P. FAST BEING REPLACED. HELP ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF THE NUMBER THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. YES PLEASE. SO THAT PART OF THE REASON BUT A BILL ADDRESSING THE FACT THAT THE CLASS OF THAT CANNOT BE FROM- AND NEGATIVE YOU HAVE TO SHOW THAT YOU COULD HAVE GONE TO COLLEGE AND AFFODABLE CHECK. OUT OF THE CLASS. OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY ARE YOU FINISHED WITH THE QUESTION US OKAY THEN MS GARCIA. NO ACTUALLY I WAS GONNA ANSWER BUT NOTHING ELSE. OKAY BOB I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS- YES PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU AT MISTER CHAIR MISTER CHIANG AND-  AGREE THE WATER IS REALLY CRITICAL ILLNESS I THINK YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD TO SHUT DOWN SEVERAL WELLS IN MY DISTRICT AS A RESULT IF YOU FAST CONTAMINATION SO SOMETHING I'M- INCREDIBLY AWARE OF AND UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF WORKING TOWARDS I GUESS MIGHT HAVE A COUPLE I'M CONCERNS WITH THE BELL. THE FIRST I GUESS THE SIMPLEST ONE WILL START WITH WHICH IS- THE BILL FOCUSES ON THE POINT OF SALE RIGHT WE'RE BANNING THE POINT OF SALE APP FOR THESE ITEMS AND I GUESS I UNDERSTAND LARGE MANUFACTURERS SERVICE STORES THAT THEY MAKE THEIR OWN CLOTHING IF YOU WELL- BUT- ATHLETES ARE IS NOW A VERY POPULAR ITEM IN CALIFORNIA'S BOUTIQUE SAYS THAT'S WHAT MOST PEOPLE WHERE MOST OF THE TIME POST CODE. SO I GUESS PART OF MY CONCERN IS IF WE'RE TELLING SELLERS NOT TO SELL IT BUT WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING TO THOSE THAT HOW DO WE HOW DO THOSE SELLERS NECESSARILY ESPECIALLY OUR SMALL SELLERS NOTE WHETHER COMPLIANCE OR NOT WITH THIS LAW. I DON'T. YEAH I THINK I THINK IT'S A FAIR QUESTION WHICH I THINK WE'RE HAPPY TO EXPLORE THINK FOR US WE HAD AS WE HAD TALKED YESTERDAY PRIMARILY LOOKED AT SOME OF THE LARGER COMPANIES- AND WE HADN'T- HI THERE EXEMPTED SMALLER SELLERS ARE LOOKED AT LABELING BUT THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE COULD DEFINITELY TOUGHER LOOK AT TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE SECONDS CLEAR EDUCATION AND GUIDANCE I UNDERSTAND ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE A MOM AND POP UP BOUTIQUE YOU KNOW THEY DON'T HAVE TIME TO DO ALL THIS RESEARCH ABOUT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEIR PRODUCTS OF. WOULD BE HAPPIER OKAY FOR HOW TO PROPERLY DRESSED UP THANK YOU AB AND THEN MY SECOND QUESTION WHICH IS LESS THAN WELL- IS SO. I DON'T KNOW THAT I FEEL LIKE THIS SCIENCE HAS BEEN CLEARLY pHEARD YOUR WITNESS AND I APOLOGIZE BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER HER NAME FROM SPRING. CALIBRATING FOR THE SPANISH TALKING ABOUT SORT OF EXPOSURE EVEN THROUGH THE WEARING OF THESE CLOTHES THAT WAS THE FIRST I HEARD OF THAT AS A POTENTIAL POINT OF EXPOSURE- AND I'VE SEEN AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S ANY SCIENCE IN THE ANALYSIS THAT INDICATES THAT AS FAR AS I CAN SEE. WHERE THAT IS BEEN PRESENTED TO ME ALTHOUGH NO SCIENCES BEEN PRESENTED TO ME AT ALL ON THIS TOPIC WHICH- I WISH WHAT HAPPENS ENERGY SEE- AND- SO THEN THE QUESTION BECOMES OKAY IS IT IS THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT ARE WE CONCERNED ABOUT THE WATER WAYS WHICH IS WHAT I HEAR MR TEAM TALKING ABOUT. AND THEN IT SEEMS LIKE VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD SCIENCE SHOULD BE AVAILABLE ON WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS COMING OUT WASHING MACHINES RIGHT AND I'VE YET TO SEE THAT AND SO I THINK THAT BANNING THE SALE OF. LARGE CLASSES OF ATHLETIC WEAR INCLUDING IN CALIFORNIA IS NOT A SMALL MOVE TO TAKE AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THE SCIENCE TO BACK IT UP AND I FEEL LIKE THE SIGNS THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED IS WELL THEN OUR WATER WHICH WE KNOW BUT WE ALSO KNOW THERE'S MULTIPLE SOURCES OF THIS. SO IS THIS THE SOURCE. IS THIS A SOURCE CONCERN AND- I JUST WANT THERE TO BE MORE CLARITY FOR GONNA TAKE THE MOVE TO BAN THE SALE OF THESE. THE VAST PRODUCTS THAT THIS IS ON. SO- THIS IS MY THIRD YEAR OF KAREN P. FAST BILLS DARK DR COURT TRADITIONALLY HAS. REQUESTED OF VOLUMES ON SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH WHICH WE DID PROVIDE HIM. I'M SORRY I DIDN'T GET THE NOTICE BUT WE ARE HAPPY TO SHARE WITH YOU ALL THE VARIETY OF SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES BECAUSE I THINK THE RESEARCH IS FAIRLY CLEAR- I DON'T KNOW IF EITHER OF THE WITNESSES WANT TO TALK ABOUT BOTH. THE WATER ISSUE AS WELL AS DOCTOR IF DOCTOR SCHNEIDER YOU WANT TO DIRECTLY ADDRESS THE- NEAR THE CLOTHING TOUCHING THE SKIN OR THE PRODUCT THE TEXTILE TOUCHING THE SKIN ISSUE. BUT HAPPY TO LET THE EXPERTS KIND OF HANDLE THAT NE BUT WOULD HAPPEN TO CATCH ALL THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IN IT. SURE I'D BE HAPPY TO ADD ON IN THE THAT'S REALLY GREAT QUESTION THAT YOU ASK AND- I YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK IT'S- A MATTER OF HUMAN DIRECT HUMAN EXPOSURE OR VERSES. YOU CHEMICAL COMING UP IN DRINKING WATER I THINK THESE CONCERNED COVER BOTH- THIRD AT TEN VERY LITTLE STUDY OF- ABSORPTION THROUGH THE SKIN- OF P. FAST CHEMICALS FROM PRODUCTS SECTION. ARE TREATED WITH PEE FAST- AND THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE HAS BEEN PRETTY MUCH LIMITED TO ONE OR TWO CHEMICALS- BUT IN ADDITION TO THE LARGE POLYMERS THAT ARE PRESENT IN PRODUCTS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF- SMALLER CHEMICALS- THAT. TIME ARE YOU STILL PROCESSING AIDS- IN MAKING THE POLYMERS THAT MAY ALSO BE PRESENT IN THE PRODUCT- WE ALSO KNOW THAT PIZZA CAN BE. VOLATILE LIES AS WELL- AND UP AND IN DR SO THERE ARE NUMEROUS WAYS THAT P. FAST IN PRODUCT. CAN INCREASE EXPOSURES THROUGH HOUSTON WEARING UP THE PRODUCT. AS WELL AS THE BROADER LIFE CYCLE CONCERNS AND THE. POTENTIAL TO CONTAMINATE DRINKING WATER. I CAN. QUICKLY ADD THAT YOU KNOW THE IDEA HERE IS TO BROADBAND UPON A CATEGORY THAT THE BAND. HARMFUL CHEMICALS AND UNDER LOTS OF PRODUCTS ALREADY ON THE MARKET. I DON'T USE THE CHEMICAL- AND- YOU KNOW THOSE BECAUSE OF THE HARMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CHEMICAL BELIEVE. THAT THE- THAT I JUSTIFIED EFFECTIVE. AND ALL KIND OF VERY VALUABLE. TERMINAIS SPEAKER THIS ISSUE VERY BRIEFLY SURE. I WOULD AGREE THAT THE- EXPOSURE STUDIES ARE PRIMARILY LIMITED TO PFOA ANOTHER ACID NON POLYMERIC P. FAST- AND I WOULD ALSO JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT THE PRODUCTS THAT I WAS DISCUSSING TODAY ARE NOT. WASHED IN A WASHING MACHINE- I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY MAKE IT INTO A WATER TABLE. PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THEY ARE A POLYMER AND NOT GOING TO GO AND NOT REALLY WATER SOLUBLE SO I JUST DON'T THINK THOSE CONCERNS BEING EXPRESSED OUR- WOULD WOULD. THERE'S NO UTILITY TO BANNING P. FAST IN THE CATEGORY OF PRODUCTS AND DISCOUNTS. SO FIRST OF ALL I DON'T KNOW WHAT. THE FEST PROBLEM AREAS AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT AND I WILL GO THROUGH THAT. BOB DID YOUR DO YOUR EXPERTS HAVE A COMMENT ON P. FAST POLYMERS. A LOT OFTEN TWO OTHER MISTER CAR. TO CAR DOCTOR SCHNEIDER HAVE ANY COMMENT ON THAT. ON THE P. FAST POLITICIANS START UP. YES I'M HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THAT PART SECOND NINE BY DOCTOR SHAPESHIFT THAT FIRE TO FOLLOW UP- THE FIRST THING I'LL SAY IS THAT THE TV AT THE DEPARTMENT TALKING CONTROL I LOOKED AT THIS ISSUE AND REGULATE IT HALF OF THE CLASS AND THEY SAY THAT ALL THOSE NEED TO BE AT THAT AGE. WHICH ARE EITHER THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF THAT OR THE- DEGRADATION PRODUCTS OF ALL THESE THAT THEY PUTTING POLITICS AND THEREFORE THAT NEEDS- MATERIAL AND UP- IN OUR ENVIRONMENT AND IN OUR BODY. AND THAT EVEN DIE FOR THE LIFE CYCLE OF COLIN WAS NOT AS BIG AS THEY BEGIN MONDAY AND UP IN- IN. LANDFILL OF THE COMMISSION TO WATER TABLES AND ONE CLOTHING AS MUCH MAKE IT END UP IN THE WATER TABLE THAT WAY AS WELL FINALLY I ALSO WANTED. TO JUST FLAG THAT- IT DOES NOT COME ITEM AND BY THE TERRY. THE LITTLE FOR EARLIER THE CAN. NO COVERED TECH. NO HOW TO GOOD AND- YEAH. IS SO BOTTOM LINE EVAN ABILITY TO CARE. OUT. BOB SO THERE SHOULD THEY HAVE THE SAME ISSUE. I'M GOING TO ASK MY- FELLOW TO LOOK INTO THIS. AND ILL GET AN ANSWER FOR YOU- BEFORE- IT. THE QUESTION IS DO WE LET IT OUT OF THE COMMITTEE TODAY OR DO YOU WANT TO WAIT. FOR MY NECK CHAIR I DON'T THE INTERNET MY OWN VOTE. IN THE- I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS I DO WANT MY- SIZE FELLOW TO TAKE A LOOK INTO IT. SO THAT WE HAVE A BETTER IDEA SINCE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS JUST BROUGHT UP HERE. I DO YOU KNOW IF THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE FAST AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND I INSISTED ON THAT BEFORE I ALLOWED THE BILL TO COME TO US AND IN PARTICULAR STUDY BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION DIRECTORATE GENERAL- FOUND THAT- IN FACT THESE TEXTILE. PRODUCTS CONTAINING P. FAST- DO YOU IN FACT CONTRIBUTE TO EMISSIONS OF P. FAST AS WELL AS CONTAMINATION OF SOIL AND DRINKING WATER I MEAN THAT'S DEFINITE- AND ACCORDING TO. THE DEPARTMENT OF- INCLUDING INFANTS YOUNG CHILDREN AND PEOPLE OF CHILD BEARING AGE. ARE SUPPOSED TO BE PASSED FROM LEFT LEATHER AND TEXTILE FURNISHINGS. AND IT FURTHER THE STUDY STATED P. FASHION TEXTILES CAN BE RELEASED INTO INDOOR AIR. HUMILIATING DUST AND YOUR EXPOSURE TO P. FASTER HERS WHEN PEOPLE INHALE AND INGEST THIS CONTAMINATED AIR AND DUST SO. I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S A REASON TO. EXCLUDE OUR FURNITURE. IS WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO FIVE. AGAIN WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK WORK I'M WILLING TO TAKE A LOOK AT ANY EVIDENCE YOU HAVE. HASN'T COME UP TILL NOW- I WOULD LIKE TO GET THE BILL OUT OF THE COMMITTEE UNLESS THERE'S PEOPLE WHO WANT TO KEEP IT IN THE COMMITTEE. UNTIL LOVE WE HAVE OUR NEXT HEARING BUT I WOULD LIKE TO GET IT OUT NOW AND IN THE MEANTIME WE CAN LOOK AT THESE ISSUES. AND I CAN WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON THOSE SO. THE AUTHORS OKAY IN THE OPPOSITION IS OKAY. I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL OUT TODAY. WE STILL WITH MORE QUESTIONS. BUT I DO FOR THAT WE OUGHT TO GIVE A FAIR. HEARING TO WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY AND- I HAVE SOMEBODY HERE WHO'S NOT AN EXPERT BUT HE HAS ALL THE BACKGROUND TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND- WILL BE GLAD TO LOOK AT ANY PAPERS AND SUCH THAT YOU HAVE SO WE WILL LOOK AT THAT IN GREATER DETAIL. ALL RIGHT MISS GARCIA JUST AS DOES THIS THE DISCUSSIONS CONTINUE TO SWANA CONTINUED AS TO. KEEP OUR P. FIVE AS A CLASS AND NOT START TO PUSH HIM OUT AS WE HAVE SEEN THE SHORT CHAIN BEHAVE VERY SIMILARLY TO THE LAUNCHINGS LAUNCHING SO SHE BREAKDOWN A LOOK LIKE THE CHARGING ALONG THE WAY AND SO AS WE ARE DOING THIS WORK I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT- WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY WASHING THIS FURNITURE OR- IN IN. THE LAUNDRY BUT THEY ARE ENDING UP IN OUR LANDFILLS AND THAT LAND FILLED AND IT- THE MATERIALS LEACHING INTO OUR WATER SYSTEM THAT WINTER GROUND THAT WAY AS WONDERS A LOT OF SCIENCE- ON THAT- AS WELL OUT THERE AND SO. I'M GONNA GO READ ABOUT PEOPLE'S POLYMERS. THANK YOU FOR ADDING TO. TO MY HOMEWORK AND IN THE SPACE BUT I JUST AS THE NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE AND I KNOW THE OTHER WORKS WITH THE OPPOSITION TO TRY TO FIND COMMON GROUND AS POSSIBLE I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE KEEP ASSESSED. AT DIFFERENTIATE. ALONG THE WAY I ALSO HAVE A BUDGET LETTER ON HELPING MUNICIPALITIES AND SMALL WATER AGENCIES PAY FOR THIS. YOU'RE WELCOME TO COME TALK TO MY OFFICE A LOT. OKAY ANYTHING ELSE SO I JUST I AM YOU KNOW I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS WORK ON THIS I THINK I'M GOING TO HOLD OFF UNTIL I GET. BETTER ANSWERS TO MY QUESTIONS BUT RESPECT THE CHAIRS FOR AND I THINK IT WILL VOTE TODAY AND- LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING. ALL RIGHT- DR RANDALL IS BACK. I'M SURE WE'VE HEARD FROM- MISSPELLED K. HAND SHE'S GOING TO HOLD OFF TILL NOW SHE SHE LOOKS AT THE SCIENCE LITTLE BETTER SIR ANYONE ELSE WHO FEELS THAT THEY NEED MORE TIME ON THIS IF NOT THEN WE HAVE THE VOTES TO GET IT OUT.
