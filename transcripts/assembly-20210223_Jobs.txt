COME WE WILL EXAMINE CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC RECOVERY TO HELP FRAME THIS HEARING IT LET US REMEMBER THAT RESPONDING TO THE CORONA VIRUS PANDEMIC HAS REQUIRED THE STATE TO TAKE EXTREME AND RAPID STEPS TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ALL CALIFORNIANS WITHIN ONE WEEK OF MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY THE STATE WENT FROM OPEN FOR BUSINESS. TO IMPLEMENTING A STRICT STAFF HOME ORDER FOR EVERYONE NOT DIRECTLY ENGAGED IN WHAT GOVERNMENT CONSIDERED AN ESSENTIAL AND CRITICAL BUSINESS ACTIVITY SINCE MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY IT IS ESTIMATED THAT MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA HAS SHUT THEIR DOORS PERMANENTLY AND OVER THIRTEEN POINT NINE MILLION UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN FILED WITH OUR STATE EDT DEPARTMENT. THIS IS RESULTED IN MORE THAN A AND TWENTY. BILLION AND UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS BEING PAID TO IMPACTED WORKERS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND THEIR FAMILIES. AS WE TRANSITION FROM OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE TO ECONOMIC RECOVERY IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THE LESSONS FROM THE GREAT RECESSION. A RISING TIDE DOES NOT LIFT ALL BOATS. LET US NOT FORGET THAT EVEN WHEN CALIFORNIA ENJOYED A HUNDRED AND TWENTY STRAIGHT MONTH OF ECONOMIC GROWTH FOLLOWING THE GREAT RECESSION THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC FORCES DRIVING INCOME INEQUALITY. JUST TO SHARE WITH YOU BETWEEN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE AND THROUGH TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EARNINGS FROM THE TOP 001% OF HOUSEHOLDS INCREASED BY MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE PERCENT. AS COMPARED TO EARNINGS OF THE BOTTOM 90% OF HOUSEHOLDS WHICH ONLY EXPERIENCING. OF TWENTY TWO POINT 2% GIVEN THESE DIVERGENT INCOME OUTCOMES IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT CALIFORNIA HAS RANKED PRIOR. RIGHT PRIOR TO THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC WITHIN THE TOP TIER OF STATES RELATIVE TO HOUSEHOLD POVERTY THIS DOES NOT HAVE TO BE THE CALIFORNIA STORY GOING FORWARD WE NEED TO LEARN FROM THE GREAT RECESSION AND THIS TIME WE CAN BUILD BACK BETTER. AND BUILD BACK STRONGER SO MY INTENTION AND INITIATING THE SERIES OF HEARINGS I REALLY CREATE A PLATFORM BY WHICH THE ASSEMBLY JOBS COMMITTEE CAN HEAR FROM OUR STAKEHOLDERS.

A MAYBE COMMITTEE MEMBER MAY HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS REGARDING THE SMALL BUSINESS PRESS. BOB SURE ENOUGH I. A ABSOLUTE IF I ANSWER THEM I'M SURE MICHELLE CAN. PROVIDE MORE DE. ABSOLUTE WON'T UNDER THAT THIS PROGRAM IS YOU VERY UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA WHICH- THIS SITE HAS NEVER BEEN. THIS AMOUNT OF GRANTS NEVER BEEN PROVIDED I TO BUSINESSES ANYWHERE NEAR THIS MAGNITUDE AND SO APPROVING SUCH A SIGNIFICANT APPROPRIATION. I WE FACE THE MAJOR TASK OF ENSURING. GRANTS ARE EQUITABLY DISTRIBUTED. I DISBURSEMENT OF THE FUNDS ARE TRANSPARENT. AND THAT'S JUST PROGRAM MANAGEMENT COURSES HELD ACCOUNTABLE. I DO HAVE A QUESTION- DEALING WITH JUST REALLY UNDERSTANDING THE MARKET BASED ON THE PROGRAM'S REVENUE LIMITS HOW MANY SMALL BUSINESSES AND HOW MANY NONPROFITS IN CALIFORNIA. MEETS THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND THE- CRITERIA. I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO- CHAIR I MIGHT THERE ARE- I MEAN WE KNOW MANY PEOPLE APPLY IN THE FOR TWO ROUNDS RIGHT NOW WAS AS WE SAY- OF THE- THERE ARE I'M SURE MORE WHO. WHAT WILL APPLY AS WE REACH OUT THROUGH OUR NETWORK OF SMALL BUSINESS ASSISTANCE CENTERS AND OTHER- PARTNERS UP THERE THERE ARE MANY BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT THEIR I DON'T KNOW THAT. AND MICHELLE MAYBE YOU HAVE. AN ANSWER I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE WE CAN QUANTIFY THE TOTAL NUMBER BUSINESSES WHO WOULD MEET THAT CRITERIA. AND THEN JUST START ONE OF THE YOUNGSTERS I'M SURE CHAU THEY SPOKE TO. TOUCH ON THAT. I AM HAPPY TO JUMP AND HE- UNTIL WE KNOW THE NEARLY. SOME THAT SAYS THIS IS A THE STATE OF. ARE TWENTY EMPLOYEE- OR- AND SO MOST OF THEM WOULD LIKE SAY- INTO THE L. CRITERIA FOR THE PROGRAM- BUT SMALL BUSINESSES. AS YOU KNOW LIMITED SO. OFFICE LEVEL. THANK YOU MICHELLE AND JIM ONE ONE OTHER QUESTION I DO HAVE ABOUT THE I TURN THE TO MY COLLEAGUE ON THE COMMITTEE. THIS MORNING AS- IT OVER WHAT'S UNDERSTAND COMMON MINOR OWNER WOMAN OWNED BUSINESSES APPLY FOR THE GRANTS I KNOW THAT IT IS STILL UNCLEAR WHETHER THE PROGRAM IS MEETING ITS GOALS- BUT WHY HAS INFORMATION ABOUT WHO APPLIES NOT BEEN PUBLICLY REPORTED BY RACE. ETHNICITY GENDER AND INDUSTRY SECTORS YET. MICHELLE DO YOU WANT TO TAKE THAT WOULD. HI THANK YOU YES SO WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE SELECTION PHASE RIGHT NOW AND SO- ONCE WE ARE ABLE TO THE APPLICANTS FROM SELECTED TWO AWARDED WE WILL BE SHARING- THE AGGREGATE INFORMATION ABOUT BE AWARDED APPLICANTS. WONDERFUL AND WE HAVE REALLY. YEAH NO PROBLEM. LET ME TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARNER FORGOT. YES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR. A COOPERATIVE WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT PROGRAM- ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK ALL LEGISLATORS AND OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE VERY INTERESTED IN IS ONE OF THE CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE PLACING ON THIS PROGRAM- TO INSURE. BEFORE DISTRIBUTION DURING DISTRIBUTION AFTER DISTRIBUTION THAT THE GRANTS ARE GING TO WHERE THEY NEED TO GO AND TO REDUCE ANY IMP ANY POSSIBLE FRAUD THAT CAN HAPPEN. SO WHAT CHECKS AND BALANCES TRANSPARENCY HOW OFTEN YOU REPORT OUT ON WHO'S GETTING THE GRANT HOW THEY'RE HELPING HOW ARE YOU MEASURING SUCCESS AS APPROACH. HI THIS IS MICHELLE AGAIN IT'S- JUSTIN HERE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION SO- IN SELECTING THE INTERMEDIARY WE WANTED TO ENSURE THAT THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS IN PLACE- WOULD IT PREVENT. ANY SORT OF FRAUD WASTE AND ABUSE AND SO AT THE DIRECTION OF THE STATE WE ENSURE THAT- PROPERTY DOCUMENTATION WOULD BE COLLECTED BY THE APPLICANT- AS WELL AS THE TECHNOLOGY ON THE BACK AND- WOULD BE ABLE TO DO BACKGROUND CHECKS. AND CREDIT CHECKS AGAIN ON THE APPLE GET- TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO- FRIDAY- BE OCCURRED- KERR IN THE PROGRAM ITSELF I'M IN SO THAT TECHNOLOGY IS IN PLACE- AND AT. THE PROGRAM ITSELF WAS SET UP TO BE A SIMPLE AND EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE AND SO WE HAVE THOSE CONTROLS- BUILT IN- TO THE PROGRAM. SORRY I DON'T THINK I CLEAR THAT WHAT SORT OF ALREADY ARE YOU GONNA BE DOING WHILE THIS PROGRAM IS RUN RUNNING OUT SO YOU HAVE. PREVENTION ON THE FRONT END YOUR VERIFICATION AND THE APPLICATION PROCESS. BUT I THINK IT WOULD BEHOOVE US AS- AS THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT WERE REGULARLY LOOKING AT THE DISTRIBUTION- AND MAKING SURE THAT ALL THOSE SAFEGUARDS WERE PUT IN THE FRONT AND- ARE ACTUALLY BEING DONE- THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS AS THE GRANTS GO OUT. SO I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY WISE FOR US TO HAVE SOME TRANSPARENCY ON WHO'S GETTING THE GRANTS. HOW THEY'RE HELPING. AND TO DO REGULAR AUDITS- SO THAT WE DON'T END UP IN OTHER SITUATIONS LIKE WE HAVE WITH OUR STATE GOVERNMENT. WHERE SOMETIMES. EVEN WITH ALL GOOD INTENTIONS THINGS CAN GO AWRY. THANK YOU AND IF I COULD JUST HAVE A MOMENT- AND WONDERFUL- JUST VERY BRIEFLY HERE. LET ME TURN TO OUR WHILE YOU DO THAT MICHELLE IF I COULD JUST TURN TO. ONE OF OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO'S WITH US VIRTUALLY WHO'D LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION. ALL WE HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER PARTY PETRIE-NORRIS HE CONNECTED. YES THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIR CERVANTES AND I THANK YOU- MYERS AND MISS MAC RODMAN PERKS FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING- I THAT LIKE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBER WAS REALLY PLEASE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO PASS SB EIGHTY SEVEN YESTERDAY WITH BIPARTISAN UNANIMOUS SUPPORT AND DIED DELIVER. MEANINGFUL RELIEF TO HELP STABILIZE CALIFORNIA'S SMALL BUSINESSES WHO ARE HURTING SAID ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW ON WITH THE INITIAL ROUND AND A FUNDING I THINK THERE WERE MANY SUCCESSES AND MANY THINGS THAT WE CAN'T AND SHOULDN'T CELEBRATE IN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE CERTAINLY IDENTIFIED AS AN OPPORTUNITY I BELIEVE STATEWIDE WAYS I NEED TO ENHANCE OUR OUTREACH AND COMMUNICATION EFFORTS AND I TO DO AN EVEN BETTER JOB. ENGAGING OUR STATEWIDE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS CAN YOU SPEAK BRIEFLY TO ISSUE OUT WHAT YOU ARE DOING AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS ADDITIONAL TWO POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN GRANT FUNDING WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ENHANCE THAT OUTREACH AND COMMUNICATION AND ENSURE THAT ARE PARTICULARLY OUR MOST UNDERSERVED BUSINESSES ARE ABLE TO- PARTICIPATE AND. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS PROGRAM. ABSOLUTELY AND MATTER CHAIR BE. FOR TO PROVIDE MY PRETTY SHE- I THINK IT CAN HELP LOWER YOUR A LOT DISK. THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED AT THIS. YEAH SIR IF WE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT WE CAN DO SO. GREAT THANK YOU. AND SO RECOGNIZING THE ENORMOUS IMPACTS SMALL THIS AVE EASTER OPEN- OUR OFFICE CARILLO BA THE OFFICES THE SMOKERS ABBOTT HAS BEEN TRY FOR RESERVE AS WELL AS BEST PRACTICES ARE THIS AND LOCAL AND PRIVATE GRANT PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS AND SO WE KNEW THAT IN ORDER TO REACH THE SMALL BUSINESSES ESPECIALLY THOSE MOST HARD HIT BY THE NINETEEN THE PANDEMIC. THE REGIONAL STAFF HOME ORDERS AND THE CLERK BLUEPRINT FOR SAFER KANEMI- WE HAD TO CREATE A DISTRIBUTION MODEL THROUGH A STRONG NETWORK OR PLATFORM THAT HAD SUCCESS IN REACHING IN PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE AND THAT THE SPECIALLY TO THOSE COMMUNITIES WHO HISTORICALLY FACE BARRIERS IN ACCESSING CAPITAL AND HAVE EXPERIENCED HIGH IMPACT FROM THE PANDEMIC. UP IN OUR OFFICE WE WANTED TO SERVICE MANY SMALL BUSINESSES AS POSSIBLE AND IS IT EQUITABLE MANNER AS POSSIBLE WITH THE GOAL OF REACHING THOSE THAT AGAIN WHAT MOST NEGATIVELY IMPACTED I'M. IN A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS. AND SO BAY ON OUR EARLY- THE GOVERNOR OFFICE AND THE LINE. WE OUTLINED AND GRANT PROGRAM THAT WOULD FOCUS HELPING ON GETTING CASH RELIEF INTO THE HANDS OF A LARGE CROSS SECTION OF BUSINESSES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE I'M IN SO. THAT THAT ALLOW THE PROGRAM- FOR IT TO BE A STRUCTURED AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES WHILE IMPLEMENTING THE CONTROLS AS MENTIONED FOR FRAUD WASTE AND ABUSE- I'M THE PROGRAM WOULD BE SCALABLE AND AFFORDABLE WITH MINIMAL ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. BUT STILL LEVERAGE THE EXISTING ECOSYSTEMS FOR OUTREACH AND SENSE TOO MANY OTHER PROGRAMS- THAT WERE PART OF A RESEARCH AND- THAT WE LOOK TO WORK FIRST COME FIRST SERVE. OR SHUT DOWN TOO EARLY WHEN DEMAND PEAKS IT WAS DECIDED VERY EARLY ON BUT THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM WOULD NOT BE A FIRST COME FIRST SERVE PROGRAM I'M IN OTHER WORDS OPERATE ON A ROLLING BASIS AND INSTEAD WOULD BE OPEN TO ALL ELIGIBLE BUSINESSES. UNTIL THE VERY END OF THE CLOSE OF THE ROUNDS AND THEN PRIORITIZE THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN MOST IMPACTED BY KOBE NINETEEN I'M AGAIN AS DEMONSTRATED BY THEIR GEOGRAPHY. INDUSTRY AND IMPACT AS A RESULT. OF ACCESS TO OTHER SUPPORT. AND SO TO THAT ARE ALL- WE TO FISH TO DEVELOP MARK. WITH THE RE THAT WAS DONE. AND INSTEAD BEST. WE WORKED WITH THE GOBIZ BUSINESS. UNIT TO. INTERPOSED IN X. THAT EMERGES KERR FOR INTERMEDIARY TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAM- YOU KNOW WE FOR GUIDE AND PUBLIC POSTING THE- P. HONESTY COUNTY PARTS WEB FOR EIGHTEEN. WHICH INCLUDED ALLOW FOR DAY PERIOD FOR PUBLIC.

RE AND OUR- TO ENJOY THAT THE INTERVIEW IS THAT WAS HAD BE A TO SCALE ONE. QUICKLY TO MEET THE PROGRAM'S WITH TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEMS TO HANDLE THE DEMAND- THIS WAS ESPECIALLY CRITICAL GIVEN THE FUNDS HAD TO BE DISBURSED BY THIS APRIL FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND SO GIVEN THIS TIME FRAME THE INTERMEDIARY HAD TO DEMONSTRATE THE ABILITY TO OPERATE QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY. WITH CONTROLS IN PLACE AGAIN TO PREVENT THAT FRAUD WASTE AND ABUSE THESE CONTROLS- AS I HAD MENTIONED EARLIER INCLUDE SCREENING FOR REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION AS DIRECTED BY THE STATE AND THEN CONDUCTING. CREDIT CHECKS AND BACKGROUND CHECKS. AND ENEMY- HAD TO DEMAND THAT THEY IN THE- STRONG NETWORK AND SEE. IS% THOSE CAN TO I AND OTHER SMALL BUSINESS ECOSYSTEM ORGANIZATIONS TO QUICKLY ENGAGE OUTREACH IN SUPPORT OF THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITIES. THE CDFI IS ARE IN THE COMMUNITIES OUT THERE MISSION BASED LENDERS WORKING WITH UNDER SERVED- WITH THAT AND BANKED AND UNDER BANKED COMMUNITIES ALREADY. AND SO IN ADDITION ARE ARE HE MADE IT A PRIORITY FOR THE INTERMEDIARY PARTNER AND COLLABORATE WITH THE STATE'S NETWORK OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS LIKE THE SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTERS AND WOMEN'S BUSINESS CENTERS I'M BETTER HUNDRED PART BY THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE EXPANSION PROGRAM. THAT OUR OFFICE ADMINISTERS I'M IN THIS IS TO EXPAND THE REGION SERVICES TO UNDERSERVED SMALL BUSINESS GROUPS WHO AGAIN WHO HAVE HISTORICALLY FACED THOSE BARRIERS TO RESOURCES CAPITAL NETWORKS. AND SO WITH THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE VERY PLEASED TO REPORT THAT TO DATE THE PARTNERS HAVE CONDUCTED OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE IN OURS AND THAT'S REACHING OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES IN OVER EIGHTY LANGUAGES. AND THAT BEGAN ON DECEMBER TWENTY FOURTH TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT WHICH WAS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE PROGRAM WAS FIRST LAUNCHED- OUR OFFICE IN THE INTERMEDIARY CONTINUOUSLY ADDED. PARTNERS TO THE PROGRAM. WHO THEN WORK WITH THEIR LOCAL AND REGION PARTNER. INCLUDING LOCAL AND ETHNIC CHAMBER TO CREATE FOR REACH OF THOSE. THE RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM- HAS REALLY A LOT QUICKLY TO A DE IS TO ADAPT TO IT AND- AND I COULD MODIFY AND- MORE CLARITY TO THE PLOT. I'M INCREASING TECHNOLOGY CAPACITY TO MANAGE THAT INCREDIBLE LARGE DEMAND THAT WE SEE. I'M AND NOT EXAM OF THIS IS THAT WHILE THERE ARE CURRENTLY EIGHTEEN LANGUAGES ON THE PLATFORM IN A TOTAL THIRTY LANGUAGES SPOKEN ACROSS OUR NETWORKS AND WEBINARS IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES EVERY SINGLE DAY. THE INTERMEDIARY MOVED TO TRANSLATE THE APPLICATION INTO FIVE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES FOR PARTNERS TO USE WHEN GUIDING SMALL BUSINESSES THROUGH THE PROCESS. IT'S REALLY A HUB AND SPOKE MODEL- IT WITH PRIMARY PARTNERS IN A BROADER NETWORK A LOCAL PROVIDERS IMPLYING THE MESSAGE IN THE COMMUNITY- YOU KNOW IN ADDITION. OUR OFFICE AN INTERMEDIARY AND OUR PARTNERS ARE GENERATING EARNED MEDIA AND SOCIAL MEDIA. FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE LOCAL. TELAVI NETWORKS LIKE YOU KNOW. AMPLIFY THE PRO. AND WE HAD A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER ACTUALLY- SHE SPOKE TO US AND LEARN THAT ABOUT THE PROGRAM FROM WATCHING UNIVISION AND ROBLIN AND DESPITE BEING LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT AND I'M CONNECTED TO ANY OF THE PARTNERS- SHE WAS ABLE TO APPLY. TO THE PROGRAM AND IN FACT THE MAJORITY OF APPLICANTS COME STRAIGHT THROUGH THE WEBSITE AND THAT'S CALIFORNIA C. A. RELIEF GRANT DOT COM AND WE CONNECT THEM TO THE GRANTS AND THE PARTNERS ON FROM THERE. SO WHILE THE PROGRAM IS NOT MEANT TO SOLVE ALL THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE AN ENTREPRENEURIAL IN OUR SMALL BUSINESS ECOSYSTEM- WE'RE STILL VERY PLEASED WITH THE OUTCOMES WHICH HAVE INCLUDED CONNECTING THEM TO CVS BUYS. IN THE TECHNICAL SYSTEMS PROVIDERS WITH SMALL BUSINESSES WHO NEED THAT ONGOING SUPPORT.

LET ME INTRODUCE OUR FOR NEXT WEEK OR COULD GET READY LET ME INTRODUCE OUR NEXT SPEAKER WITH US THIS MORNING IS DR ROBERT FAIRLY. WHO IS A PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ SINCE THE BIG PANDEMIC BEGAN HE HAS BEEN TRACKING ITS IMPACT ON SMALL BUSINESSES AND SHARING HIS RESEARCH WITH POLICYMAKERS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND HIS FIRST REPORT HE REVEALS THAT WHILE MOST MAJOR INDUSTRIES IN THE U. S. BASE LARGE DROPS IN THE NUMBER OF BUSINESS OWNERS. IN THE EARLY MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC BUSINESSES OWNED BY PEOPLE OF COLOR WERE HARDEST HIT USING ASSIMILATION MODEL DOCTOR FAIRLY ESTIMATED THAT BETWEEN FEBRUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY AND APRIL TWENTY TWENTY THERE WAS A DECREASE OF 41% AMONG BLACK OWNED BUSINESSES. 32% A MONTH BY NEXT OWN BUSINESSES AND 26% AMONG ASIAN OWNED BUSINESSES FROM THIS BASE RESEARCH SHE HAS PUBLISHED SEVERAL OF THE REPORT'S TRACING THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC. TODAY HE WILL NOT ONLY BE DISCUSSING THAT RESEARCH BUT HE WILL ALSO BE SHARING I CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC INFORMATION A DOCTOR FAIRLY THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING I PLEASE BEGAN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU SO I WANT TO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR INVITING ME FOR THIS HEARING OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. SO I HAVE A POWER POINT PRESENTATION THAT IS NOT I CANNOT SHARE SCREEN SO I THINK SOMEONE IS GOING TO SET IT UP FOR ME. YES WE'RE HANDLING NOT RIGHT NOW. GREAT OKAY SO NEXT SLIDE. SO I'M A PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ I'VE BEEN DOING RESEARCH ON ENTREPRENEURSHIP RACIAL INEQUALITY IN SMALL BUSINESS POLICY FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS NOW I'VE BEEN ASKED TO DISCUSS THE FINDINGS FROM MY RESEARCH ON THE IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC ON SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. ONE THING THAT'S BEEN REALLY DIFFICULT IS FINDING UP TO DATE INFORMATION AS YOU KNOW SOME OF THE SPEAKERS ALREADY MENTIONED IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO GET THIS KIND OF INFORMATION AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE BEEN DOING THIS OVER THE PAST NINE MONTHS PRETTY MUCH SINCE THE PANDEMIC STARTED. I'VE BEEN ANALYZING THAT DATA COMPILING IT YOU KNOW LOOKING FOR DIFFERENT SOURCES THAT I CAN FIND AND SO I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF WORK MOSTLY ON THE NATION AS A WHOLE BUT I'VE ALSO BEEN CALCULATING ESTIMATES FOR CALIFORNIANS SO THIS HEARING BUT I DID WAS I FOUND THAT SOME OF THE MOST RECENT DATA IT JUST BECAME AVAILABLE. SO PART OF THAT IS GOING TO BE FOR JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME I PEOPLE PRESENTED THESE NUMBERS AND THEN ALSO SOME OF THE REVENUE DATA THAT I'M STUDYING FOR CALIFORNIA FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY JUST BECAME AVAILABLE SO I'M GONNA SHOW YOU SOME OF THOSE NUMBERS IN THE SECOND. SO NEXT LINE. SO I'M FOCUSED ON THREE DIFFERENT RESEARCH QUESTIONS OVERALL FOR THE PANDEMIC. SO THE BIG ONE IS WHAT HAPPENED A SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. INDEPENDENT DISPROPORTIONATELY CLOSE MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES IS A KEY QUESTIONS NOT. THEN ANOTHER QUESTION I'VE BEEN INTERESTED IN. IS HOW MUCH TOO SMALL BUSINESSES LOSE AND SALES DURING THE EARLY STAGES OF A PANDEMIC. WHAT TYPES OF BUSINESSES WERE HIT HARD OR THE WHAT WE THINK- HAS HAPPENED OR ARE THERE OTHER INDUSTRIES OR TYPES OF BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN AND HEARTS. AND I'VE ALSO BEEN REALLY INTERESTED IN STUDYING THE GOVERNMENT RELIEF PROGRAMS. SO I FOCUSED ON THE U. S. ONES THAT PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAMS. IN THE I DON'T PROGRAMS. AND THE BIG QUESTION THERE IS THAT I'M INTERESTED IN IS WHETHER OR NOT THEY'VE BEEN DISTRIBUTED EVENLY TO MINORITY COMMUNITIES ALL TALK ABOUT THAT. YOU KNOW SOME OF MY RESEARCH A- TO YOU. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO THE TIMING OF THE PAN. HI THIS IS PRETTY WELL KNOWN RIGHT MARCH A LOT THE WAY HEALTH OR TO CLEAR NINETY ATTENDED SAN FRANCISCO AREA PRETTY MUCH THE FOR PLACE TO MAKE AND CHAU IN PLACE RESTRICT. MARCH THE STATE BECAUSE IMPOSES RISK MARCH AT NEW YORK STATE AND THEN BY EARLY MOST IMPOSE SOCIAL DISTANCING. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS COMPARE EVERYTHING FROM FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY SKIP OVER MARCH TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN THEN GO TO APRIL TWENTY TWENTY SO NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF ACTIVE BUSINESS OWNERS IN THE U. S. CD'S ARE OWNERS. THEY HAVE SOME KIND OF WORK ETHIC IN THEIR BUSINESS SO I CANNOT LOOK AT THEIR SALES HERE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THAT A SECOND ANOTHER PROJECT. BUT HERE I'M JUST LOOKING AT WHETHER OR NOT THE BUSINESS OWNER IS CURRENTLY ACTIVE. IT'S ACTUALLY RELATIVELY STEADY THIS IS FOR THE NATION AS A WHOLE IT'S RELATIVELY STEADY OVER TIME. BUT WHAT YOU SEE IS THIS UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF THE DROP IN APRIL TWENTY TWENTY. IF YOU COMPARE THIS TO THE GREAT RECESSION. IN THAT ONE MONTH. OF APRIL WE LOST TWENTY OVER OVER THE ENTIRE GREAT RECESSION WE ONLY LOST FIVE PERCENT. NEXT LIGHT. THERE WERE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS ON MINORITY GROUPS SO AFRICAN AMERICANS WE SAW A LOSS OF FORTY ONE PERCENT. LAST NEXT MENTIONED CEMEX FIGHT. NOW WHAT I'VE BEEN INTERESTED IN SINCE THAT KIND OF EARLY BROWN OF CLOSURES HAS THERE BEEN A REBOUND TO SOME OF THOSE BUSINESSES ONLY TEMPORARILY CLOSED AND REOPEN. EXIDE I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A STEADY IMPROVEMENT IN ACTIVE BUSINESS OWNERSHIP EVERY SINGLE MONTH UP UNTIL OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY K. PLEASE NEXT FIVE. THAT GROWTH HAS BEEN PRETTY MUCH COVERED BY DIFFERENT GROUPS IN THE POPULATION SEATED ON THE FAR LEFT HERE YOU CAN SEE- THE NUMBERS FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS THE MIDDLE ONE IS FOR LATIN. AND THE THIRD- SET UP GROCERIES- CENTER CALLS IS FOR ASIAN AMERICANS SO FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS AND LATIN ACTS BUT WE SEEN AS KIND OF A STEADY INCLINE. BUSINESS OPENINGS. ASIAN AMERICANS THERE IS BEEN A DIFFERENT STORY WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT LITTLE BIT MORE MEDIAN THE QUESTION AND ANSWER BUT FOR THE MOST PART IT'S RELATIVELY AND KNOWING WHAT HAPPENED THERE WHY IT STALLED OUT. OKAY NEXT LINE. WHAT IS HAPPENED SINCE OCTOBER IS. IS CONCERNING. THERE HAS BEEN A DROP IN BUSINESS ACTIVITY IT HAPPENED NOVEMBER IT HAPPENED IN SEPTEMBER AND IT HAPPENED AGAIN IN THIS LATEST STATED BUT AS I MENTIONED JUST BECAME AVAILABLE A FEW DAYS AGO. AND I PREPARED. FOR THIS HEARING. SO WHAT YOU SEE IS THE STEADY MONTH TO MONTH TO MONTH DECLINE OVER THE LAST THREE MONTHS SINCE OCTOBER. THE NEXT SLIDE. WHAT HAPPENED IN CALIFORNIA SO I GENERATE NEED ESTIMATES FOR CALIFORNIA. FOR THIS HEARING SO NEXT SLIDE. YOU CAN SEE IS EXACTLY THE SAME PATTERN. RIGHT WE SEE THIS KIND OF RELATIVELY STEADY BUSINESS OWNERSHIP ACTIVITY IN CALIFORNIA OVER YOU KNOW THE PREVIOUS YEAR AND A HALF OR SO THE BIG DROP IN APRIL FROM FEBRUARY IN A MONTH BY MONTH. INCLINE IN RATES UNTIL OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN A REVERSAL RIGHT SO CALIFORNIA IS ESSENTIALLY FOLLOWING EXACTLY THE SAME PATTERN AS THE U. S. OVERALL HE NEXT LINE. SO THAT WOULD BE REALLY INTERESTING TO COMPARE THIS DIRECTLY RIGHT SO WE SEE THE SAME PATTERN IN CALIFORNIA IS THE LAST. BUT HOW. DIFFERENT ARE THEY THE CHANGES OVER TIME SO THE GOLD BARS HERE SHOW CALIFORNIA THE BLUE BARS SHOW UNITED STATES AND WHEN YOU CAN SEE IS EARLY OFTEN THE PANDEMIC SO IN APRIL MAY JUNE CALIFORNIA WAS ACTUALLY HIT HARDER RIGHT SO THE SHUTDOWNS WERE MORE SEVERE IN CALIFORNIA. WHAT HAPPENED IS- IN OCTOBER NOVEMBER THEY WERE RELATIVELY SIMILAR BUT THEN WHAT YOU SEE IS IN DECEMBER JANUARY OR SEEN KIND OF THE SAME TYPES OF CLOSURES. AND SO REALLY WHAT'S HAPPENED IS KIND OF THIS KIND OF MORE RECENT RAMPART SHUTDOWNS IS BEEN ROUGHLY THE SAME AS CAL IN CALIFORNIA AND THE WEST- CALIFORNIA SEEING A BUT THE OTHER MONTHS- WERE PRETTY SIMILAR. NEXT SLIDE. YEAH DOES THIS LOOK BY I IN RACIAL. SO IN CALIFORNIA THE SAMPLE SIZES ARE TOO SMALL FROM THE DATA THAT I'M USING TO REPORT AFRICAN AMERICAN NUMBERS BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE'S- A SIMILAR PATTERN FOR LATIN ACTS AS OVERALL CALIFORNIA. THAT THERE WAS A BIG DECLINE IN APRIL AND THEN THERE WAS KIND OF THIS MONTH BY MONTH REBOUND. AND THEN KIND OF A STEADY WELL YOU KNOW KIND OF PLATEAU AREA AND THEN A LITTLE BIT OF A SLIGHT DECLINE IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. ASIAN AMERICANS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S MORE OF A KIND OF A STUBBORN RECOVERY THERE. THAT IS A MENTION BEFORE IS NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR IT APPEARS AS THOUGH IT'S PARTLY DUE TO TYPES OF INDUSTRIES AND BUSINESSES. ASIAN AMERICANS ON- MANY OF THEM ARE IN KIND OF MORE PERSON TO PERSON CONTACT TYPE BUSINESSES. AND YOU CAN SEE FINALLY FOR. WHITE NONLIFE BACKS ON BUSINESSES CEMEX. FIGHT NOW I'VE ALSO BEEN DOING. ON LOS IN CAL. IT'S A- DIFFICULT TO GET KIND OF. I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION TO LOOK AT AVERAGE SALES LOSSES. ALMOST ALL OF MY RESEARCH IS FOCUSED ON THE SECOND QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT QUARTER BECAUSE THAT INCLUDES APRIL MAY JUNE SO YOU CAN SEE HERE IS TAXABLE SALES GROWTH OVERALL GROWS ABOUT 325% EVERY QUARTER AND THIS IS YOUR OVER YOUR GROWTH SO WHAT YOU SEE THAT IN THE FIRST QUARTER THERE WAS A BIT OF A DECLINE. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY WAS WHEN WE SAW HUGE DECLINES OR LOOKING AT IT A DROP IN TOTAL SALES OF BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA FIFTEEN PERCENT- IT'S VERY INTERESTING IS THAT IN THE THIRD QUARTER WE SEE A REAL BIG CHUNK BACK NOT ALL THE WAY BACK TO WHERE IT SHOULD BE ABOUT 325% GROWTH RANGE BUT ALL THE WAY BACK TO ESSENTIALLY ZERO GROWTH SO WE WERE NOT SEEN LOSSES THEN. THIS IS OF COURSE COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SO I'M NOT COMPARING THIS TO THE PREVIOUS QUARTER WHICH I THINK WAS THE KIND OF A BIG MISTAKE WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT. GDP NUMBERS FOR THE U. S. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. NOW HOW DID THIS HIT DIFFERENT TYPES OF BUSINESSES YOU CAN SEE THE ONES THAT WE REALLY EXPECTED TO BE HIT HARD ACCOMMODATION IS THE ONE IN BLUE IN THE FAR LAST. REAL NICE AND 90% DROP IN SALES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY SO WAS JUST DEVASTATED AND BACKORDERS DRINKING PLACES ALCOHOLIC ARE YOU KNOW CARS. THAT WAS HIT EXTREMELY HARD. YOU CAN SEE ARTS ENTERTAINMENT RACKS FULL SERVICE RESTAURANTS WERE HIT HARD HIT STORES CLOTHING STORES ALL THE ONES THAT WE CAN EXPECT BUT THE LOSSES WERE PRETTY SEVERE RIGHT WE'RE SEEING LOSSES A FIFTY. DOLLAR ALL THE WAY UP TO NINETY PERCENT. ON THE FLIP SIDE A LOT OF INDUSTRIES THAT DID FINE THEY ACTUALLY CONTINUE TO GROW. AND WANTED REALLY STICKS OUT IS NON STORE RETAILERS WHICH INCLUDES ONLINE. AND THAT GROUP BY A HUNDRED EIGHTY PERCENT. OVER COURT IN QUARTER TWO OF. TWENTY POINT NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. IN THE RESEARCH PROJECT THAT WERE ON IT ALL LOOKS REALLY AND- IN HOW THIS RELATED TO. THE NUMBER OF KOBE CASES ANY COPING CASES PER CAPITA EARLY ON. SO THESE ARE BACK IN APRIL AND MAY. AND WHAT I FOUND IS THAT THERE SEEM TO BE A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP SO REMARKABLY CASES THAT WERE BEING RECORDED PER CAPITA. IT LOOKS LIKE CONSUMERS WORK AND I'M MORE NERVOUS ABOUT GOING TO STORES AND SHOPPING AT THE STORES. OUT IT ALSO COULD BE RELATED TO KIND OF MORE ENFORCEMENT OF CLOSURES BUT THIS TIME THERE WASN'T THAT KIND OF COUNTY BY TIMELY CLOSURES THAT WE SEE NOW. NEXT SLIDE. I'VE ALSO BEEN VERY INTERESTED AS I MENTIONED IN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AID THE PPP AND I DON'T PROGRAMS IN THE CARRIAGE ACT THE ROUTE TO PRIORITIZE SERVING UNDERSERVED MARKETS AND BUSINESSES ON BY SOCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED INDIVIDUALS SO THE QUESTION I WAS INTERESTED IN PEACE LONG PROGRAMS COACH MINORITY COMMUNITIES SO I WAS ABLE TO GET DATA FROM FIFTY MILLION DIFFERENT LOANS TO ANALYZE THIS REALLY CAREFULLY CEMEX SLIDE PLEASE. AND WHAT I FOUND IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE FIRST ROUND OF DPT PROGRAM THERE ACTUALLY IS A VERY STRONG NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH A MINORITY SHARE THE COMMUNITY. SO THOSE FUNDS DID NOT FLOW TO MINORITY COMMUNITIES EARLY IN THE FIRST ROUND WHAT HAPPENED. IS CONGRESS REALIZE THIS AND THEN SWITCH THE PROGRAM TO REALLY GO OUT AND BE MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE ABOUT GETTING LOCAL COMMUNITY BACK BANKS. FINANCIAL TECH. INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER TYPES OF LENDING AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT COULD TARGET LOW INCOME MINORITY AREAS AND WHAT WE FOUND IS IN THE SECOND ROUND IT DID REVERSE AND THAT MINORITY- COMMUNITIES TO GET LOANS. CAN BACKSIDE. SO WHAT CAN WE DO TO ME FORWARD I THINK THEY'RE SORT OF FOR TAKEAWAYS FROM THE RESEARCH THAT I'VE DONE IN THE PRESENTATION THAT I'VE GIVEN. YES I THINK THERE ARE THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS CONSUMERS NEED TO FEEL SAFE AGAIN. WE NEED TO GET THE VACCINE OUT WE NEED TO GET OUT FASTER IN MY OPINION. YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE ANXIOUS TO GO BACK TO RESTAURANTS AND SHOPS AND DAKOTA DOWNTOWNS AND SHOP LOCALLY BUT THEY ARE GOING TO BE RELUCTANT TO DO THAT POLICE YOU'LL SIX. I ONE IS MEAN NEED MORE. ASSISTANCE I THINK THIS IS A CRITICAL PERIOD FOR A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESSES. I THINK RENT RELIEF IS REALLY IMPORTANT SO IT'S GREAT TO HEAR THAT THAT BILL. PASSED YESTERDAY IN THE GOVERNOR IS LIKELY TO SIGN IT TODAY. WE ALSO NEED TO SLOW ONLINE SHOPPING WHICH IS HAPPENED PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. SMALL BUSINESSES NEED TO HAVE MORE OF AN ONLINE PRESENCE SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT COULD HELP IS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT A LOT OF- ONLINE SEARCHES SEARCH ENGINES. THEY OFTEN WILL SHOW KIND OF BIG BOX STORES ARE LARGER RETAILERS WOULD BE GREAT IF THEY COULD FOCUS ON SMALL BUSINESSES AND LOCAL BUSINESSES SO THAT. YOU KNOW INDIVIDUALS CAN PRIORITIZE THEM. I MEAN I THINK MORE DATA ON RACE NEEDS TO BE COLLECTED THAT IS CLEAR. D. P. PT LOAN. PROGRAM WAS CRITICIZED HEAVILY FOR NOT COLLECTING THIS INFORMATION THE RESEARCH THAT I SHOWED YOU JUST LOOK AT THE MINORITY SHARE THE COMMUNITY AND NOT. ACTUAL LOAN RECIPIENTS I THINK THAT WAS A HUGE MISTAKE THAT WAS MADE. AND ALSO THIS WAS ACTUALLY MENTIONED EARLIER IN IN THIS IN THIS- SESSION. IS A COLLECTION INFORMATION APPLICATIONS. THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS WHO'S APPLYING FOR THESE LOANS AND WHO'S GETTING DENIED FOR THESE LOANS. IS. THERE RACIAL EQUITY. IN THAT. BACKSIDE PLEASE. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THE FINDINGS MY RESEARCH I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING YOUR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR OUR CHAPTER I DISCOVERED QUICKLY DO YOU KNOW WHAT DO YOU HOPE FOR A POLICY LEADERS CAN TAKE AWAY FROM YOUR RESEARCH AND- WHAT OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO PERHAPS ACTIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN TAKE TO MITIGATE THE DISPARITIES AMONG. DIFFERENT BUSINESS OWNER GROUPS. YEAH I MEAN I THINK THE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW WE FIRST NEED THAT KIND OF INFORMATION RIGHT IF WE HAD BETTER RECENT FORMATION ON APPLICATIONS. BUT A RECENT FORMATION A LOAN RECIPIENTS I THINK WE COULD START TO LOOK AT THIS EXTREMELY CAREFULLY. RIGHT NOW I FEEL LIKE CHARLIE MY HANDS AND OTHER RESEARCHERS ANSWER TIGHT WE IT'S SO HARD TO GET THE DATA TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND. EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON SOME OF THE THEORIES ARE THERE IT'S A LACK OF INFORMATION ANOTHER ONE IS THAT IT'S A LACK OF. OF KIND OF THESE MORE LONGER ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS WITH BANKS SO IF WE CAN BREAK THOSE PROBLEMS AND GET MORE INFORMATION OUT- CREATE. YOU KNOW QUICK MORE. YOU KNOW LIKE SHORTER TERM ESTABLISHMENTS WITH BANKING OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT COULD REALLY HELP. OUR ONE OF THE STATEMENTS JUST MADE A MOVING FORWARD- THAT SMALL BUSINESSES NEED TO HAVE MORE OF AN ONLINE PRESENCE HOW DO YOU PROPOSE THAT CONVERSATION START WITH OUR SMALL BUSINESSES WHAT DO WE DO. YEAH THAT'S A TOUGH ONE TO- I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT COULD HELP. IS HOW TARGETED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DIRECTLY FOR. CREATING WEB PAGES FOR CREATING. YOU DON'T WASTE THAT MAKE IT EASIER FOR RESIDENTS TO SHOP ONLINE AND LOCAL BUSINESSES. YOU KNOW WE COULD ALSO TRY TO PUT A LITTLE BIT CRUSHER ON SEARCH ENGINES. AND TRY TO GET THEM TO PRIORITIZE LOCAL BUSINESSES RIGHT I MEAN THE PROBLEM THERE IS A LOT OF THAT IS BASED ON AT REVENANTS RIGHT AND THAT MAKES IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. BUT YOU KNOW MAYBE AT THIS POINT IN TIME GIVEN THIS SEVERE CRISIS. AND THIS. POTENTIAL WE'RE GONNA LOSE SO MANY SMALL BUSINESSES THAT THEY WILL MAKE AN EXCEPTION. I'M THANK YOU SO MUCH- THIS IS SUPER FASCINATING AND I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN SEEING HOW YOUR RESEARCH GOES AND I THINK ALL OF US WOULD LOVE TO HELP YOU GET THE DATA YOU NEED BECAUSE THIS IS SUPER VALUABLE- AND HELPING US TO MAKE GOOD POLICY DECISIONS FOR THE STATE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT- AND YOU KIND OF TOUCHED ON IT IN YOUR PRESENTATION OF YOU DON'T HAVE THE DATA THAT SIGN. I'M WONDERING ABOUT THE EXPONENTIAL IMPACTS OF MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES COMBINED WITH COMMUNITIES THAT EXPERIENCE HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT AND THEREFORE THEY HAVE LOWER SPENDING CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO HELP THOSE MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME. DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE STATE HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THAT THAT KIND OF ADDITIVE OR EXPONENTIAL IMPACT WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE SPENDING COME UP CAPACITY IN THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE MAYBE THEY'VE BEEN HARDER HIT BY COVERT THEY'RE EXPERIENCING MORE UNEMPLOYMENT THEREFORE THEY HAVE LESS DISPOSABLE INCOME. THAN THAT HOW THAT RELATES TO HELPING- THE MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES WHO IN THOSE COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE BEEN MORE SEVERELY IMPACTED THIS THAT MAKES SENSE. YES IT DOES. YOU KNOW SORT OF LOCAL DOLLARS LOCAL I THINK IT'S KIND OF THE SAME. THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT HERE. BUT I THINK IT'S DEEPER THAN THAT THERE IS A FAIR AMOUNT OF RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THAT WHEN. YOU LOOK AT THESE KIND OF SMALLER MINORIT OWNED BUSINESSES. TEND TO HIRE. COLLECT MIX SALUTE IF YOU LOOK AT BLACK OWNED BUSINESSES FOR EXAMPLE THEY TEND TO HIRE OTHER AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THOSE BUSINESSES THOSE JOBS OFTEN ARE VERY LOCAL. THE SUPPORT THAT COMMUNITY AND SO NOT ONLY ARE YOU HELPING SMALL BUSINESSES. IN TERMS OF THE OWNER AND CREATING JOBS OVERALL YOU'RE HELPING THE JOBS IN THAT COMMUNITY AND THAT'S A DISADVANTAGED AREA. THEN YOU'RE HELPING THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNER YOU'RE HELPING CREATE JOBS IN THAT LOCAL AREA. AND YOUR CREATING WEALTH AND THAT WEALTH OF COURSE ANY SPENT OR AT LEAST IT'S MORE LIKELY TO BE SPENT BACK IN THAT COMMUNITY. AND SO THERE'S DEFINITELY THIS MULTIPLIER. ANY OTHER COMMIT MEMBERS WISHING ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK YOU MADAM AT MIKE IS WILL AROUND- THE SHUT THE REBOUND AND THEN TIE BACK TO YOUR SLIDE. AS FAR AS THE- SECTORS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED. BY OCTOBER NINETEENTH. AND SO MY FIRST QUESTION IS WITH THE SHUT DOWNS- WHERE THEY DRIVEN BY CERTAIN SECTORS MEANING- WERE SOME OF THE SECTORS HIT HARDER. THAN OTHERS- IN WHICH BUSINESSES AND WHICH SECTORS WHERE THEY- YES THAT WAS ONE THING THAT WAS NICE IS BEING ABLE TO GET THE SALES DATA STATE CALIFORNIA. YOU COULD SEE THAT ACCOMMODATIONS WAS THE ONE THAT WAS HIT THE HARDEST. SO THERE WAS A 90% DROP IN REVENUES. TO THOSE BUSINESSES. THAT IN SOME OF THE OTHER ONES THAT WERE HIT HARD COURTS WERE. HOURS WERE IT VERY HARD. NO BUT A LOT OF SMALL SHOPS THAT WERE SHUT DOWN SO CLOTHING. GIFT SHOPS YOU KNOW THOSE TYPES OF BUSINESSES WERE HIT EXTREMELY HARD. AND WHEN YOU YOU TALKED IN YOUR PRESENTATION OF A REBOUND- WITH JOBS AND BUSINESSES REBOUNDING OPENING UP. DID THAT FOLLOW THE SECTORS THAT WERE HARDEST HIT OVER THOSE DIFFERENT SECTORS THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO EXPAND AND REBOUND FROM THE CALL THE NINETEEN- ECONOMIC IMPACT. SO I DON'T HAVE THE DATA TIED TO THOSE INDUSTRIES SO I WAS FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON YOUR QUARTER TILL TWENTY TWENTY. SO I THINK THAT THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT IT IS BECOMING AVAILABLE AND WILL BE ABLE TO STUDY THAT SAM AND SEE WHERE THE REBOUNDS WERE SPECIFICALLY- YOU KNOW TARGET. THANK YOU AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THAT BAD INFORMATION SO WE COULD PINPOINT- CERTAINLY THOSE THAT ARE REBOUNDING BUT THEN THOSE THAT THAT HAPPENED. THAT NEEDS SOME ADDED- ADVOCACY FOR THEM I WANT TO THANK YOU ON YOUR SLIDE UP SHOWING. UP WITHIN THE GROWTH A SALES GROWTH PERCENTAGE. AND SOME OF THE SECTORS THAT WOULD DRASTICALLY HIT BY. THE IMPACT OF TWELVE NINETEEN BUT ALSO- SHOWING THAT SOME BUSINESS SECTORS CONTINUED TO HAVE A GROWTH PERIOD- DURING THIS TIME. SO THAT THAT WHAT I'M IN IN MY MIND ALLOW US TO FOCUS OUR ENERGY ON THE TRUE BUSINESSES THAT ARE BEING IMPACTED. BY COVERT NINETEEN SO THAT WE CAN GET ALL OF THEM REBOUNDING BACK INTO THE ECONOMY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY SOUTH THANK YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE A SIMILAR QUESTION TALKED FAIRLY- ONE OF YOUR EARLIER SAW SLIGHT INDICATE THAT THE ASIAN BUSINESSES ARE. SOMEWHAT SLOWER AND RECOVERY- COMPARED TO THE OTHER GROUP SO. I WAS WONDERING WHETHER OR NOT DO YOU HAVE ANY OF. DATA SHOWING THE BREAKDOWN BY INDUSTRY OR BY SECTORS REGARDING THESE BUSINESSES. WHEN I DID SOME OF MY EARLIER WORK I DO TRY TO. KIND OF FOCUS ON INDUSTRY DIFFERENCES ABOUT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I FOUND IS THAT ASIAN BUSINESS OWNERS AND ACTUALLY OTHER MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES. TENDED TO BE IN INDUSTRIES THAT WERE SHUT DOWN MORE IN APRIL IN OTHER INDUSTRIES. SO ONE GOOD EXAMPLE IS AGRICULTURE'S ONE OR IF IT'S DONE WELL IF YOU LOOK AT THE OWNERS OF AGRICULTURAL BUSINESSES THEY TENDED NOT BE MINORITY ALL. YOU DON'T WORKERS OFTEN ARE MINORITY WORKERS IN THOSE INDUSTRIES BUT NOT THE OWNERS OF THE BUSINESSES SO YOU THINK IT YOU KNOW I'M TALKING NATIONALLY HERE- THAT A LOT OF THE FARM OWNERS ARE. ARE- ARE NOT A MINORITY OWNS IT SO THAT DADS ROLL SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES BUT ALSO JUST INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE A LOT OF PERSON TO PERSON CONTACT YOU KNOW YOU THINK OF. BARBER SHOPS NAIL SALONS REALLY SMALL RETAIL STORES THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT WERE KIND OF HIT THE HARDEST YOU KNOW EARLY ON WITH CLOSURES AND HAVE SEEN THIS KIND OF. YOU KNOW OPENING SHUTTING DOWN OPENING YOU DON'T RE OPENING. AND SO I THINK THAT'S A BIG PART OF IT. LET ME GO AND TURN TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MANY. AND A WALL GO. THIS MEMBER KARTI PETRIE-NORRIS. THANK YOU DOCTOR FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. BUT MOST OF IT WAS ON A NATIONAL LEVEL. I WANT TO HOPE THAT WE GET MORE INFORMATION AND DATA TO YOU. SO WE CAN ZERO IN CALIFORNIA AND BREAK IT ALL THE WAY DOWN INTO THE COUNTIES. OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA LET ALONE TO INDUSTRIES. BUT THE RURAL COMMUNITY VERSUS URBAN CITIES AND- AN EXTRA LAYER OF BREAK DOWN. SO WE KNOW EXACTLY WHERE. WERE HIT HARDEST. IN THE FUNDING THAT NEEDS TO BE A RESOURCE BACK TO THOSE COMMUNITIES- TO BE AFFECTED MORE. BECAUSE I THINK IN THE LONG RUN. URBAN CITIES. HAVE BEEN HIT AND RURAL COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN HIT TO PROBABLY TWICE AS HARD. SO I'D LIKE TO SEE A BREAKDOWN AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET TO THAT DATA THAT YOU NEED. ON A VERY EXPEDITIOUSLY. TIMELINE SO WE GET THE DATA BACK US VERY. AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR. THANK YOU DOCTOR FIVE THIRTEEN HERE AND FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- PENTOMIC CERTAINLY HAS HIGHLIGHTED AND EXACERBATED FUNDAMENTAL INEQUITIES. ARE ALL ACROSS THE STATE AND- CERTAINLY AMONGST OUR OUR SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITIES AS WELL- CLEAR PRIORITY FOR THIS COMMITTEE AND FOR THAT THE LEGISLATURE OVERALL IS TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE DIRECTING FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND RELIEF. TO BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN HARDEST HIT PARTICULARLY IN HISTORICALLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES YOU MENTIONED SOME OF THE HURDLES THAT EXISTS NOT JUST IN OUR STATE BUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF ENSURING THAT THEY DOLLARS ACTUALLY FLOATS YOU HI. YOU MINORITY OWNED AND MANAGED BUSINESSES ARE THEIR MODELS IN OTHER STATES THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT- THEY HAVE AND SUCCESSFULLY BROKEN DOWN. THOSE BARRIERS ARE THERE ARE THERE LESSONS THAT WE CAN LEARN A CALIFORNIA POLICY MAKERS- FROM SUCCESSES IN OTHER STATES. I AM NOT ACTUALLY LOOKED- ACROSS DIFFERENT STATES YOU KNOW WHAT MOST OF MY RESEARCH HAS BEEN FOCUSED CAN MORE BROADLY ON THE U. S. AND THEN OF COURSE THE BIG PROGRAMS LIKE THE TPP PROGRAM IN THE IDYLLWILD GROUNDS AND OF COURSE THE RESEARCH THAT I'VE BEEN DOING THAT CALIFORNIA. SO I HAVEN'T REALLY LOOKED THAT MUCH ACROSS STATES I HAVEN'T HEARD YOU KNOW FROM THE GROUPS AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT I'VE BEEN TALKING TO ABOUT. ANY STATE HAVING LIKE A SPECIFICALLY NO REALLY WELL TARGETED OR WEALTH SHE PROGRAM RIGHT NOW. OKAY YEAH I THINK. CERTAINLY DID THAT THE DOW THAT YOU SHOWED FROM THAT THAT PPP PROGRAM. ONE VERSUS PPP PROGRAM RUN TO CERTAINLY DOES DRIVE HOME THE POINT THAT I'VE- THAT BEING INTENTIONAL. AND I'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON ON OUTREACH CAN HAVE. REALLY REALLY MEANINGFUL IMPACT- CITING TAX INCREASING USE AS WE LOOK. AS WE LOOK FORWARD TO BE AT THE SUBSEQUENT ROUND OF FUNDING AFTER CALIFORNIA'S COMPUTER RELIEF GRAPHS. THANK YOU SEE. NO OTHER QUESTIONS ARE LET ME JUST AGAIN THANK YOU DOCTOR FOR JOINING US TODAY. I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR CONTINUED COLLABORATION AND I MAYBE JUST GO IN AND DIGESTING SOME OF THIS INFORMATION SEEM WHERE WE CAN GO FROM HERE BUT BUT LET ME GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO OUR NEXT ITEM.

WE HAVE THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND MANUFACTURERS IN OUR STATE IN 70% OF THEM ARE. LESS THAN SEVENTY LESS THAN TWENTY EMPLOYEES- SO WE ARE STATE OF A VERY SMALL MANUFACTURERS. YOUR MISSION IS REALLY TO PROVIDE SOLUTIONS THAT WILL HELP IMPROVE THEIR PRODUCTIVITY. AND THE COMPETITIVENESS- THE PROTECTED PRODUCTIVITY SIDE IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECASE WE ARE HIGH COST MANUFACTURING STATE. SOME SAY THERE'S A 20% PREMIUM TO MANUFACTURE IN OUR STATE SO THE IDEA OF GETTING THEIR PRODUCTS- MATOS AS INEXPENSIVELY AS POSSIBLE TO BE COMPETITIVE IS A VERY STRONG- VISION FOR US. WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO IMPROVE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURING IN THE PUBLIC GOOD WE DEFINE THE PUBLIC GOOD IS. WHAT ARE WHAT DOES THE WORK WE DO TO OUR CUSTOMERS PROVIDE TO DISTANCE GDP IN REVENUE JOBS- TWO YEARS AGO WE DID A RESEARCH THAT FOUND THAT THE IMPACT FROM OUR- OUR BUSINESSES WE WORK WITH MADE ABOUT THREE POINT SEVEN. BILLION DOLLARS INFUSION THE PEOPLE STATE.

THANK YOU AND IF WE COULD JUST HOLD QUESTIONS UNTIL I EACH OF THE PANELISTS HAS INTRODUCED I MISS CURRENT B. O. WOULD YOU PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF IN THE COMMUNITY CALL. CONTRACT EDUCATION CENTERS. THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS ENSURE CERVANTES. I'M DEANNA CRANIAL AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT TECHNOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN CORPORATE TRAINING SEMINAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE STATEWIDE COLLABORATIVE. UPSCALE IN ADDITION TO COLLABORATING STATEWIDE WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR NEIGHBORS RIVERSIDE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT'S CONTRACT EDUCATION UNIT REPRESENTING NORCO RIVERSIDE CITY. I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE COLLEGES. THE PURPOSE OF CONTACT EDUCATION AS TO PROVIDE A RAPID RESPONSE AND CUSTOMIZED SHORT TERM PROGRAMS THAT OFFER ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AND VITALITY SUPPORT ASSISTANCE THROUGH TRAINING EMPLOYMENT AND WORKFORCE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. CONTRACT EDUCATION PROVIDES IMPROVES THE LIVES OF ITS LOCAL COMMUNITY BY PROVIDING LIFELONG APPS KILLING ALL POPULATIONS TO STAY COMPETITIVE IN THEIR THIRTY TO FORTY YEAR CAREER SPORTING TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES. IN THE WORKFORCE AND PROMOTING ECONOMIC PROSPERITY THROUGH WAGE GAINS CONTRACT EDUCATION DOES NOT RECEIVE ANY FUNDING FROM THE STATE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE NORTH FROM STRONG WORKFORCE MANY. A OP BY OBTAINING PUB AND CONTRACTS GRANTS ASSETS ARE LIMITED BY HOW MUCH FUNDING THEY CAN CHANGE AND BY THE RQUIREMENTS OF THOSE CONTRACTS AND GRANTS TRANSECTED CATION IS NOT OPERATING AT MAXIMUM CAPACITY DO YOU GET THE SPENDING CONSTRAINTS. LAST YEAR DURING THE PANDEMIC FOR EXAMPLE ECG WHICH IS THE ONLY ONE OF FORTY FIVE CONTRACT EDUCATION UNITS SURE SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO INCUMBENT WORKERS ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY JUSTICE INVOLVED INDIVIDUALS. AND 42% OF THE BUSINESSES SERVED WERE SMALL BUSINESSES. IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN WE SERVED ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY IN COMBAT WORKERS. WE PLACED NINETY SEVEN JUSTICE INVOLVED INDIVIDUALS INTO FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT AND SEVENTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PERSON PER YEAR TO INCARCERATE THEM. AS A TOTAL ANNUAL SAVINGS TO THE STATE OF SEVEN MILLION. FUNDING MANAGING WHAT WE CAN DO ACROSS THE STATE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISPRINT QUEST IF YOU COULD PLEASE MAKE YOUR INTRODUCTION AND TALK ABOUT THE SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY. SURE I'D LOVE TO YOU AND GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME MEMBERS OF THE JEDI COMMITTEE ENSURE WOMEN CERVANTES- I'M BIANCA AND GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU HOW WE CAN BETTER SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESS CAPITAL NEEDS AT THIS TIME. SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY IS A RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION AND WE ARE FIVE OH ONE SEE THREE THEN EMPOWERS APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND ENTREPRENEURS. TO BUILD A THRIVING AND EQUITABLE ECONOMY. THREE PANDA NEAR ONE ENFORCED BUSINESS OWNERS DID NOT HAVE AN ACCOUNT WITH THE CREDIT UNION OR A TRADITIONAL BANKS. THE NUMBER IS EVEN HIGHER FOR ENTREPRENEURS OF COLOR AND WOMEN. BUSINESS OWNERS OF COLOR TEAM LESS FINANCING THAN THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS BY OVER TEN PERCENTAGE POINTS ACCORDING TO OUR- SURVEY THAT WAS JUST RELEASED TODAY. ONE QUARTER OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS OVERALL HAVE BEEN DENIED ALONE. FEDERAL PROGRAMS LIKE TV KEY ARE CRUCIAL INDEED BUT LESS THAN HALF OF CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS HAVE EVEN APPLIED. IT'S CLEAR TO US THAT THE LACK OF THAT THINKING IT RELATIONSHIP CONTINUES TO INHIBIT BLACK AND BROWN BUSINESS OWNERS FROM ACCESSING FINANCING. WE'RE THRILLED THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS COMMITTED TO MORE FUNDING FOR THE GRANT RELIEF PROGRAMS HELPING SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS OF THE STATE DOES NOT END WITH THE GRANT PROGRAM CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO INVEST SERIOUSLY INTO ITS CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE. TO ENSURE LONG TERM RECOVERY FOR WOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS OF COLOR AND MINORITY OTHER ROLE AND MINORITY ENTREPRENEURS. THE CALIFORNIA REBUILDING FUND IS THE BEST- OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE SYSTEMIC CHANGE IN THE SPACE IT IS A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP BUT IT'S DESIGNED TO AND IT'S DESIGNED TO SUSTAIN SMALL BUSINESS LONG TERM. RECOVERY NEEDS. THREE BUILDING FUND LEVERAGES GOVERNMENT BACK CAPITAL AND PROVIDE LIQUIDITY FOR CDFI IS TO MAKE MORE LOANS TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS OF COLOR AND MAYNOR AND WOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS. SUCH AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PREPARES TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RELIEF BUT BY AND THE ESSENCE PCORI AND OTHER PROGRAMS WE HOPE YOU WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN A PATH TO LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY THAT OUR LOCAL. MOM AND POP SHOPS WILL NEED. IN FACT WE FOR IT'S MY BUSINESS SUPPORT PUBLIC POLICIES. LIKE THREE BUILDINGS I'D BE HAPPY TO AND I'M TO SHARE THOSE RESULTS WITH YOU THROUGHOUT MY TESTIMONY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH RODRIGUEZ PHD FOR COMING AND I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN WITH THE QUESTION FOR THE WHOLE PANEL WHAT IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT ACTION THE STATE CAN TAKE TO SUPPORT LOCAL. ECONOMIC AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AGAIN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. SH. IT COULD BE A QUESTION TO OUR ANY OF THE PANELISTS THAT COULD TAKE ON IT'S. ARE WE NEED NOT INVEST IN THE LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE. CAPITANEEDS AND SMALL OFFICE OWNERS IS GOING TO BE CREWS. MANY OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE ABOUT- ARE ARE CRITICAL FOR SHORT TERM. MEDIA LEAST BUT THE CAP FOR RECALL SIGN A PROGRAM THAT SYSTEM SMALL BUSINESS THE NEXT AS LONG AS. IF THIS YOUR WATER I THINK THIS A COUPLE- THEY CAN GO IN A FIRST OF ALL WE AND THIS IS WEEK I'M STILL FROM STEM RIGHT. WORKFORCE'S RULING ENOUGH WORK AND GETTING NEW SKILL WORKERS IN THE MANY- COMMUNITY. I THINK I CERTAINLY LIKE TO SEE. WELL THE AND INCREASE IN EMPLOYMENT PARA PROGRAM AND WE'RE REDUCE THIS YEAR TO A MILLION TO. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ANOTHER FIFTY MONEY DOLLARS IN THAT PROBE- IT IS ARE IN THAT PROGRAM. OUR SMALL BUSINESSES. AND CUSTOMERS THE NORTHRIDGE STUDY INDICATED THAT THE TRAINING ITSELF PROVIDES REALLY GREAT DIVIDENDS FOR NOT ONLY WAGE. BUT A GOOD ARE ALIVE FROM- FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND SECONDLY- TH STATE NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO- FIND. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE AS I SAID EARLIER WE ARE A HIGH COST STATE- IN TERMS OF MANUFACTURING OUR MANUFACTURERS- NEED HELP NOT ONLY WITH COST CONTROL BUT THEY ALSO NEED HELP I THINK ROBERT MENTIONED IT. ON. THESE DAYS. ARE GOING TO E. COMMERCE AND IF- MANUFACTURER DOESN'T HAVE ANY COMMERCE PLATFORM. AND IS ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT THAT FORM OF BUSINESS AND ARE NOT DIGITALLY SAVVY. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A PROBLEM. THE OTHER IS I THINK YOU SHOULD GET WE'VE SHOULD CONTINUE ANY KIND OF TAX OR OTHER INCENTIVES THAT GIVE OTHER STIMULATE GROWTH FOR MANUFACTURING- LET'S CLOSE GIVE A REASON FOR MANUFACTURED A MODEST EXPAND THEIR BUSINESS. IN CALIFORNIA. EXACTLY THIS IS A BIG ASK- YOU KNOW THE WHOLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND EASY ACCESS TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IS VITAL TO MANUFACTURING. WE'RE FINDING IS A MIGRATION OF WORKERS MOVING FROM THE COASTAL COMMUNITIES TO BE AN EMPIRE. OR FROM THE COASTAL COMMUNITIES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY WHICH IS CALLED AN EXTREMELY LONG COMMUTES. AND THOSE COMMUTER ARE CAUSING ISSUES WITH TURNOVER JOB TURNOVER BECAUSE A LONG COMMUTE WILL TYPICALLY LEAD TO TURN OVER AND- IN A POSITION. WHICH LEAVES MANUFACTURERS NOW. TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM. ALTHOUGH THEY HAD EVEN THE PAN WHICH IS WHICH IS FOR SKILLED WORKERS AND I. THANK YOU SO MUCH IF I COULD TURN TO THIS CURRENT B. O. AGAIN WHAT IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT ACTION THE STATE CAN TAKE TO SUPPORT. LOCAL ECONOMIC AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THANK YOU CHAIR CERVANTES ON. THIS THE CHALLENGES WE CONTINUE TO SEE RIGHT NOW IS ACCESS TO SKILLED WORKFORCE- IN BECAUSE OF CODE THAT WE HAVE THE ADDED CHALLENGE OF WORKING IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT AND WORKING WITH MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING ARE VIRTUALLY FROM HONG. I BELIEVE THAT IF WE- WERE TO INVEST INTO CONTRACT EDUCATION. OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS THE LARGEST COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM IN THE WORLD IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE OVER A HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND WE HAVE FORTY FIVE CONTRACT EDUCATION UNITS THAT ARE WORKING. ON THE FIVE YEAR DATA FOR THOSE- FOR CONTRACT EDUCATION UPSCALE PROGRAMS WE INDIVIDUALS FROM THREE THOUSAND EMPLOYERS. THE AVERAGE CHAINING GATE RANGE WAS 20% AND THE PARTICIPATION RETENTION RATE WAS 97% THE AVERAGE COST FOR FORTY HOURS OF TRAINING WAS ONLY EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS AND THE REVENUE IN TAX RATE BACK TO THE CUTS THE STATE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS. CONTRACT INDICATION IS THE STATE'S TRAINING ARM WE DO WORK WITH THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL. AND AGAIN WE DON'T HAVE ANY FUNDING COMING FROM THE STATE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. AND I FEEL THAT IF WE WERE TO INVEST INTO CONTRACT EDUCATION. WE WOULD BE ABLE TO REACH THAT THE INDIVIDUALS THE MARGINALIZED INDIVIDUALS AND COME BACK INTO WORK. THANK YOU YOUR ARE IN THEIR MOM AND ASK ONE QUESTION AND THEN TURN IT OVER TO OUR THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS TO THE PANELISTS. MISTER WATSON A NEW DRESS MAYBE THE NEEDS- OR REPHRASE IS ACTUALLY A HOW HAVE THE NEEDS OF BUSINESSES USE SERVING THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY CHANGED SINCE MARCH OF LAST YEAR. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND THANK YOU FOR THAT- IN ORDER TO KNOW WHAT IS CHANGED TO WE PROBABLY HAVE TO CONSIDER WHERE IT CAME FROM. THE PANDEMIC OF THE KEY ELEMENTS OF- AND WE GET THIS FROM EVERY YEAR WE SURVEY OUR MANUFACTURERS TO DETERMINE. WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE AND INVARIABLY EVERY YEAR GROWTH IS THE NUMBER ONE NEED THEIR THEIR ABILITY TO GROW THEIR BUSINESSES. SECONDLY WAS WORKFORCE TRYING TO SOLVE THE SKILLED WORKER PROBLEM- THAT WAS MENTIONED BEFORE AND THEN THE OTHERS COST CONTROL AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT TO INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY SO THAT WAS THAT'S KIND OF THE LANDSCAPE BEFORE. AFTER AND- ACCESS CAPITAL ROAD WHITE TO TOP THE NEEDS OF FINANCING BE ON PPP PPP- THERE ARE THERE ARE ALWAYS THESE AND COVER THEIR OVERHEAD BUT IT DIDN'T GIVE THEM WHAT THEY NEEDED TO CONTENT TO TRY AND WIN THIS THEY LOST DURING- DURING THE PANDEMIC AND BY THE WAY I ROBERTS CHART MIRRORS WHAT WAS HAPPENING MANUFACTURING I THINK HIS CHART SHOWED THAT IN APRIL OF WAS A 15% REDUCTION I THINK MANUFACTURING WHICH WAS AN AREA OF 20% INITIALLY AND IS AS SLOW EVERY RECOVERED. THIS IS YOUR OUT OF MAINTAIN THE STATE WORKPLACE- YOU KNOW TO REDUCE- IN THE WORK. BECAUSE OF CALL ED- YOU KNOW AS AS WE AT POSTPONED MAKE IT STOP IDEA OF NOT GROW THEIR- IT'S A ALL I DO OF TRYING TO. GET REPLACE THE BUSINESS THAT THEY'VE LOST AND THIS IS WHERE OUR SALES AND MARKETING AND SCO- YOU KNOW. SO YOU KNOW THE SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION ALL THE THINGS COME BACK IN AGAIN. AND HONESTLY SUPPLY CHAIN AND OPERATIONAL DISRUPTIONS- ARE HAVE RISEN TO THE TOP AS WELL THAT YOU KNOW THESE THESE MANUFACTURERS COLLECTED THE MATERIALS. I CAN'T DELIVER THEIR CUSTOMERS ON TIME AND COLBY DISCUSSED MOP RACIAL DATA DISRUPTIONS WITHIN THE PLAN ITSELF. WHICH IS CAUSING- THEIR INABILITY. TO GET THE PRODUCTS OUT AS WELL. BUT IF I COULD POSE A SINGLE TO- THERE'S WAS. FOR AS THIS NEED TO TRAIN THEIR ON HOW TO WORK FROM HOME VIRTUALLY INCLUDING HOW TO SUPERVISE AND MANAGE THEIR EMPLOYEES. HOW TO DEAL WITH VIRTUAL CHALLENGES AND SELF MANAGEMENT SKILLS FIRST INITIAL WORKERS BUSINESSES NEEDED COVERED NINETEEN AND SHE SAFETY IN CHANGE MANAGEMENT TO CONTINUE TO WORK IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION THERE WAS AN INCREASED NEED FOR DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION TRAINING AN EXAMPLE OF DIVERSITY TRAINING IS A PARTNERSHIP WE HAD WITH EASY YEP. BOB COMPANY THEY TRAINED ONE HUNDRED OF THEIR EMPLOYEES IN IN CUSTOMIZED DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION TRAINING WHICH WAS DELIVERED BOTH VIRTUALLY IN SPANISH AND IN ENGLISH. WANTED TO ALSO POINT OUT THAT WE ALSO PARTNER WITH THE WE'RE THE WORKFORCE INVESTMENT BOARDS AND WE ALSO DIDN'T ACTUALLY PARTNER WITH CMCC. I MEAN YEAH REALLY CRACK ANYTHING FROM WHAT THE PANELISTS HAVE SHARED AND IN RESPONSE TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION ABSOLUTELY I THINK IT ALL UNDERSCORES INVESTMENT AND LONG TERM GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. KEY FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IN CALIFORNIA I DID WANT TO TOUCH ON DOCTOR FARLEY'S- ILLUMINATING PRESENTATION. ON THAT DATE IT WAS. INCREDIBLE INVESTING IN THE DIGITAL DIVIDE- TO ENSURE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. IN THE RIGHT. AND WELL AS IN RURAL AREAS- MAKING SURE THEY CAN ACCESS THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BUT MANY OF OUR PARTNERS PROVIDE THE KENNEL LESS HONEST. IN THIS HEARING AS WELL AS OUR SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTERS AND WOMEN'S BUSINESS CENTERS OR ISN'T LEGAL ACTS. EAGLE VOLUNTEERS. TO HELP THEM ALSO UNDERSTAND THEIR COMPLIANCE MEASURES I THINK WE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT. HOW THE OUR BUSINESS OWNERS NEEDS HAVE CHANGED FROM THE LAST YEAR AGAIN I'D LIKE TO SITE AND SOME OF OUR DATA THAT JUST CAME OUT AND THIS MORNING ACTUALLY- SHOWS THAT 80% OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ARE STRUGGLING TO. HE THEIR RENT THOSE TO OPERATE COMMERCIAL SPACES ESPECIALLY OVER HALF OF THESE ARE WANT ONE MORE MONTH. TO RENT AND MORTGAGE 20% F THESE BUSINESS OWNERS HAVE BEEN THREATENED WITH EVICTION. WHILE HALF OF THESE FOLKS HAVE RECEIVED ET THOSE NUMBERS WERE LARGELY SKEWED TOWARDS- WHITE BUSINESS OWNERS HI THIS IS 63% OF WHITE BUSINESS OWNERS COMPARED TO AT 2032% OF BLACK BUSINESS OWNERS- SO INVESTING AGAIN IN LONG TERM RECOVERY EFFORTS LIKE THE CALIFORNIA REBUILDING FIND IS GOING TO BE A STRATEGY TO. ADDRESS THESE INEQUITIES AT SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY WE HAVE HELPED OVER THIRTY FIVE TOUSAND BUSINESS OWNERS WHO HAVE REGISTERED FOR EITHER OUR POLICY. UPDATES WERE EDUCATIONAL WORKSHOPS IN THE PAST YEAR WE'VE ADDED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND NEW BUSINESS OWNERS INSURANCE NETWORK ALTHOUGH WE'RE NOT MEMBERSHIP BASED MOST OF THESE BUSINESS OWNERS IMAGE RUN NETWORK THROUGH OUR EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES OR OUR- MEDIA WORK. NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED IN LAST YEAR SO I THINK THAT. WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THAT BUSINESS OWNERS- HAVE DEFINITELY REACHED OUT TO THE PARTNERS OR HELP. THANK YOU. LET ME TURN OVER TO SOME WORKING NUMBERS PROTECTIONS. I'M THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IT ACTUALLY. THE FIRM JAMES WATSON ONE OF MY QUESTIONS WAS IN REGARDS TO THE POLICIES THAT WE CAN DO IS A LEGISLATOR TO KEEP MANUFACTURING CALIFORNIA. BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE MORE INVESTMENT IN THE WORK FORCE DEVELOPMENT TO TRAIN OUR NEXT GENERATION. OF MANUFACTURERS BUT WE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT. MANUFACTURES IN CALIFORNIA. AND- I DON'T THINK HE'S GOING TO COME UP ON THE SCREEN. AND IN ME AS I HAVE UP BEYOND COULD THERE- CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS APPROVED A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET. HOW MUCH OF THAT MONEY AND LOANS HAVE BEEN GIVEN OUT. AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOANS. ANY DO YOU HAVE ANY OF THAT DATA. IT'S AVAILABLE IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED HOWEVER I CAN TELL YOU THAT OVER TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN LOANS HAVE BEEN MADE. I THE AVERAGE LOAN SIZE HAS BEEN APPROXIMATELY SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH I THINK UNDERSCORES THE FACT THAT THESE LOANS ARE INDEED. TARGETING SMALL TO MICRO BUSINESS OWNERS THOSE WHO HAVE LESS THAN TEN ALSO LESSEN FIVE. BUSINESSES I AND THE MAJORITY OF THE LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN NEED ARCH YOU- WORLD BUSINESS OWNERS OR WOMEN WERE. THANK YOU THAT WAS BECAUSE I WAS GOING FOLLOW UP DISCUSSION FOR THE MINORITIES AND THEN- THAT THE- WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES IN THE. STATE SO THANKS FOR ANSWERING THAT OUT FRONT. CAN WE GET YOU MISTER WHITE. ARM YEAH. THE MOMENT. THANK YOU OKAY I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'RE MICHAEL AND YEAH pWAS ON SO YEAH- YOUR QUESTION IS HOW DO WE- YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT CAN BUT COLLEGE DO TO KEEP- YOU KNOW MANUFACTURE AND CAL THROUGH WORK AND THERE'S A THINGS FIRST OF ALL THERE'S THE- INVESTING IN TRAINING THE INCUMBENT WORKERS BECAUSE INCOME WORKERS ARE THE BEST WORKING THE BEST WORKING AB IS WHEN YOU HAVE IT WAS WHEN YOU GOT. SO WE DO NEED TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN INCOME PER WORKER TRAINING IN THE SECOND OF ALL IF YOU GOT TO BUILD A BETTER BRIDGE. BETWEEN ACADEMIA THAT IS TRAINING FOLKS FOR MANUFACTURING AND INDUSTRY AND I THINK- YOU KNOW WE WORK WITH. A LOT OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES- WE WORK WITH A LOT OF UNIVERSITIES. YOU KNOW TRYING TO BUILD THIS BRIDGE BETWEEN- YOU KNOW NEW GRADUATES ARE COMING OUT- WHO HAVE. UNBELIEVABLE SKILLS IN ENGINEERING UNBELIEVABLE SKILLS IN AND WORKING- YOU KNOW TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT WITHIN MANUFACTURING HOW DO WE GET THEM INTO MANUFACTURING- THROUGH SOME KIND OF AN APPRENTICE PROGRAM. OR HOW COULD WE GET HOW CAN WE FIND. MANY FACTIONS JIM BEST IN IN NEW EMPLOYEES THAT. COME OUT OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY NETWORK. THANK YOU MISTER WALKER THE- DIFFERENCE IS A MEMBER RAMOS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- MISTER WATSON SINCE YOU'RE ON THE SCREEN. IN THE STATE- IS THERE ANY DATA BASED ON THE REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF SHOWING THE IMPACTS OF THE GREATEST IMPERFECTION IN THOSE REGIONS THEN PUT A LOOP TO SOME OF THE DIFFERENT GROWTH FACTORS OR DECLINE IN JOBS IN CERTAIN SECTORS IN CERTAIN AREAS. IN THE STATE. YEAH YEAH THERE IS- THERE THERE'S A COUPLE OF REGIONS IN THE STATE THAT WERE REALLY HARD HIT YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY IMPERIAL COUNTY- WHICH WAS STRUGGLING BEFORE GOT HIT HIT VERY HARD TO. UNDERSTAND JOAQUIN VALLEY- IN TERMS OF FOOD PROCESSORS- WHO WERE SELLING PREDOMINATELY TO RESTAURANTS I HAD AN ISSUE IN IN- IN IN SALES AND TRY TO MOVE THEMSELVES FORWARD. I THINK IF YOU WERE IN THE COMMERCIAL AVIATION BUSINESS- IN SELLING CALIFORNIA- YOU WERE HARD HIT B. BECAUSE OF THOSE SEVEN THIRTY SEVEN MAX AND PEOPLE ARE FLYING SOLO- AIRLINES AREN'T BUYING EQUIPMENT- BUT I THINK THERE ARE THERE ARE SUMMER IS A DIRECT RESULT IN WELL I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT HOME IMPROVEMENT JOHN MANUFACTURERS YOU CAN LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO MAKE EXERCISE EQUIPMENT YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO. RIDE BICYCLES- YOU LOOK AT THAT FOOD PROCESSORS ARE SELLING TO THE BOX STORES THEY'RE DOING EXTREMELY WELL SO YOU KNOW THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT. MORE THAN GEOGRAPHY IT WAS THE IMPACT OF COLD IT REALLY WAS YOUR INDUSTRY SECTOR YEAR WHEN AND WHO IS YOUR CUSTOMER WAS. AND I THINK THAT THAT KIND OF DETERMINED HOW DEEP THE IMPACT WAS LIKE I MENTIONED EARLIER IF YOU WERE SELLING IF YOU WERE AND AEROSPACE DEFENSE. IF YOU'RE THE DEFENSE SIDE YOU PROBABLY DO OKAY- DEFENSE THEIR DEFENSE- MONEY CONTINUE TO FLOW IN FACT THE- NO I'M INCREASE THAT- TAKE MAKE SURE THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN REMAINED RESILIENT AND INTACT. IF YOU WERE SELLING TO BOEING OR AIRBUS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU YOU WERE PROBABLY YOU PROBABLY HAD A FIFTY SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT. A. REDUCTION IN YOUR IN YOUR IN YOUR BUSINESS. SO WILL RECEIVE THE IN CERTAIN REGIONS THE AMP. THAT WAS GREATEST SEE AN CERTAINLY- INTO THAT- CONTINUE TO- DURING THIS TIME. THAT'S ALSO IMPORTANT FOR. US TO KNOW THANK YOU FOR THAT AND FOR DEANA- DOWN AT SERAFINO. COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. HAVE YOU SEEN A DIFFERENCE IN- THE- CREATING THE ACCESS TO SKILLED WORKER IN THE IN THE DEMAND IN IN THAT CERTAIN AREA ITSELF. YES ACTUALLY WE HAVE ON THE DEMAND ACTUALLY WENT DOWN. IT IS OF STATE TO CONCERNS ONCE WE WERE ABLE TO SWITCH EVERYTHING OVER TO A VIRTUAL FORMAT WE ARE ABLE TO BEGIN TRAINING AGAIN- I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE HYBRIDS WE GO OUT OF. THIS PANDEMIC. UP THERE THOUGH THE GREAT THING ABOUT THE VIRTUAL AS WE WERE ABLE TO- TRAIN LOCAL BUSINESSES AT THE SAME TIME. BUT THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASED INTEREST IN GOING BACK TO IN PERSON AND SO. THE FIRST AT pWE WERE STAYING SAFE IN THE PANDEMIC AND THEN AND THEN TRANSFERRING EVERYTHING OVER TO A VIRTUAL FORMAT. WE HAD TO FIGURE ALL THAT OUT THEN WE HAD A TRAINER TRAINERS ON HOW TO DO THAT. SO ONCE WE GOT THERE WE WERE ABLE TO DO THAT. BUT I WILL SAY IN ADDITION TO CERTAIN INDUSTRIES- DISTRIBUTION INDUSTRY HAS HAS NOT STOPPED THEY HAVE BEEN HIRING. CONSTANTLY SINCE EVERYTHING ON A PHYSICAL OFFERING. CAME TO A HALT. PEOPLE WERE BUYING ONLINE AND THE DISTRICT OF GOOD STILL. I CAN. SO WE WERE STILL ABLE TO TRAIN ANY PEOPLE AND GET THEM STILL EMPLOYED IN THE DISTRIBUTION. SECTOR SO THE DISTRIBUTION SECTOR- IN SAMBAR DINO CONTINUES TO BE A DEMAND FOR SKILLED WORKERS THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS WORKING WITH THE BISQUE MADE TO PERFORM. AND GET THOSE SKILLED WORKERS ON TO THOSE DISTRIBUTION PLANTS. ABSOLUTELY YES ARE I PRIMARY SECTORS OUR MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST ONE MORE QUESTION- FOR BIANCA- YOU TALKED ABOUT. LOOKING AT LONG TERM THE LONG TERM PLANNING- AND NOW WITH- HOW WE'VE BEEN IMPACTED WITH CLOVER GOING ON A YEAR- BUT KNOWING THAT OTHER THINGS COULD COME UP DOWN THE ROAD. IN THE LONG TERM STRATEGIC PLANNING IS NOW A COMPONENT BEING INCLUDED IN THAT TO ADDRESS PANDEMICS ARE CERTAIN CRISIS THAT BUSINESSES COULD BE IMPACTED BY. THAT WAS FOR BIANCA SURE SORRY I WAS ON MUTE- YEAH AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER I'M- TIRED HIGHER SIX OVERHEAD- WE CONDUCTED THIRD PARTY INDEPENDENT POLLING AND RESEARCH OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS NATIONWIDE AND IN CALIFORNIA. AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS HAVE SAID 91% OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS HAVE SET ACCESS TO CAPITAL WAS A PROBLEM THEN. I WE KNOW THAT THESE ISSUES HAVE ONLY BEEN EXACERBATED BY CLOSE IN NINETEEN. ON OR AT THE REASONS BY DR FARLEY AND AREN'T. OUR SURVEY RESULTS OF THE ALSO YOU KNOW ON ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE- I SPOKE TO A BUSINESS OWNER I SPLIT MY TIME DOING POLICY WORK IN SPEAKING TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS DIRECTLY. A BUSINESS OWNER I SPOKE TO- JUST THE OTHER WEEK- NEED TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS LAST YEAR. SHE SPENT TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THAT ON HEALTH CARE FOR HERSELF AND FOR HER DAUGHTER. I'M SO I THINK CONTINUING TO LOOK AT SOME OF THESE LONG TERM ISSUES THAT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ESPECIALLY BECAUSE BOY ROUGHLY HALF OF AMERICA'S PRIVATE SECTOR WORKERS AND HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S WORKERS. ON THESE KINDS OF ISSUES ARE RATING RETIREMENT SAVINGS HAS BEEN SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN HEARING FROM SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS THAT THEY'RE DOING. I TO GET BY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL THAT THEY NEED AT AFFORDABLE PRICES- SO I THINK THAT THESE ARE SOME OF THE COMMERCIAL RENT ISSUES THESE ARE SOME OF. THE LONG TERM ISSUES THAT BUSINESS OWNERS ARE GOING TO FACE. EVEN AFTER NINETEEN. AND JUST TO FOLLOW. WITH LONG TERM- AND LOOKING AT SOME IS. RIGHT RE LAW FROM WHAT IT NOW WITH. IN AND WE'RE HEADED. IS PART OF OUR COULD PART OF A COMPONENT BE. ADEQUATE PLANNING THROUGH INSURANCE THROUGH DIFFERENT OTHER COMPONENTS THAT WOULD HELP BUSINESSES SMALL BUSINESS IN PARTICULAR. TO CONTINUE TO WEATHER THE STORM. SURE I'M NOT AN INSURANCE EXPERT BUT IN SPEAKING TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND WORKING ON SOME WITH COMMISSIONER LARA YOU KNOW WE HAVE. FOR IT AT AND BUSINESS OWNERS HAVE BEEN RUNNING INTO MANY ISSUES AND ARE FINDING AN INSURANCE THAT WOULD CARRY THEM THROUGH. A PANDEMIC LIKE THIS AGAIN I MEAN I THINK THAT ON THE LONG TERM ACCESS TO CAPITAL NEEDS THAT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ARE FACING BEFORE COVE IN NINETEEN. WOULD ENABLE THEM TO WEATHER- A CRISIS LIKE THIS IF HEAVEN FORBID IT WERE TO HAPPEN AGAIN. ON THE OTHER. ECONOMIC CRISES AS WELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRS THANK YOU TO THE- PANELISTS FOR THEIR TIME IN BRINGING THIS MUCH. NEEDED VITAL INFORMATION TO THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU I LET ME GO AHEAD AND TURN TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER PARTY PETRI NORRIS WHO'S ON THE LINE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU ALL OF US THINK THINK ALL OF YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY FOR THIS. INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND- YEAH I THINK IT'S SAD IT'S IS MISTER WATSON YOU ALLUDED TO CALIFORNIA'S. I CHALLENGES WITH RESPECT TO OUR SKILLS GAP PRECEDED THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC WE'D ALREADY SEEN CALIFORNIA'S JOB GROWTH STARTED TO SLOW. BUT FOR THE PANDEMIC NOT BECAUSE COMPANIES WEREN'T HIRING BUT BECAUSE THERE'S A MISMATCH. OF SKILLS WITH OUR LABOR FORCE AND ARE INCREASINGLY TECHNOLOGY DRIVEN ECONOMY SO THIS IS INCREDIBLY TIMELY. TOPIC I THINK AS WE TALK ABOUT THE WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO Q. REBUILD CALIFORNIANS THAT. CENTER ECONOMY AND- RECOVERY- YOU ALL GAVE ACTUALLY SOME REALLY PRACTICAL AND TANGIBLE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WHAT WE CAN DO TO. ACCELERATE CALIFORNIANS ARE INVESTMENTS IN IN WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND IT'S GOING TO ASK A COUPLE OF FOLLOW UPS ON. ON TODAY'S STUDENT MISTER WATSON. I YOU TALK ABOUT. THE NEED IN YOUR TO AND- ARE IN. IN THE- PANEL PROGRAM CAN YOU JUST SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TO. HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE- IF THAT IF WE ARE AND CONSTRAINS WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE CALIFORNIA DO WITH THE EMPLOYMENT CONNELL TRAINING PROGRAM. AND WHAT IN YOUR VIEW WITH THAT WOULD BE THE RESULT AND ADMIT IT TO SMALL INVESTMENTS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THAT THAT IS THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE ARE A MULTI EMPLOYER CONTRACT WITH THE G. P. AND- IN PREVIOUS YEARS ACTUALLY LAST YEAR. WELL WE WERE ABLE TO TRAIN MORE THAN THIRTEEN HUNDRED. EMPLOYEES IN IN SMALL MANUFACTURERS USING USING OUR PLAN TO TRAINING PANEL FUNDS THE REDUCTION THAT FUND THIS YEAR WE WILL TRAIN ONLY FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY. OF EMPLOYEES IN SMALL BUSINESSES AND SMALL MANUFACTURERS SO. IT'S JUST IT AS WE GET MORE MONEY INTO THE EMPLOYMENT AROUND INCOME FOR WORKERS SORRY. SORRY YES GOT CARRY ON YEAH SO ARE WE DOING GLOBAL WORKER TRAINING SO WE'RE WE'RE WORKING WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION ITSELF TO UP SKILL THEIR WORK FORCE TO DO A COUPLE THINGS FIRST OF ALL GET INVOLVED IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE GETTING INVOLVED IN MAKING MORE MONEY- AND THAT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT SIMPLY- MITIGATING- YOU KNOW THE HIRING THAT THESE MANUFACTURERS CAN'T FINE. SO THE MORE MONEY THE MORE MONEY THAT EMPLOYMENT TRAINING AND PANEL HAS- IT'LL MAKE IT IT'LL MAKE AN INCREASE IN WAGES IN IN FACT I THINK DISCOUNT STATE UNIVERSITY NORTHRIDGE STUDY THAT WAS OUT ON THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL INDICATED THAT OVER TIME AFTER TRAINING THERE'S A THREE THOUSAND DOLLAR INCREASING IN WAGE FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN TRAINED- AND I THINK THE OTHER THING IS THAT WITH WE NEED TO TRAIN AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WITH THIS WORK FOR SHORTAGE AND THE NEED TO ADOPT TECHNOLOGY WE'RE JUST NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO FIND THOSE FOLKS OFF THE STREET RIGHT NOW- FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS FIRST OF ALL WE'RE ALL WORKING FROM HOME- YOU KNOW IT'S VERY HARD TO. FIND CANDIDATES RIGHT NOW I MEAN WE DO A LOT OF WORK IN OUR COMPANY TO TRY AND RECRUIT FOR MANUFACTURERS. I'LL TELL YOU IT'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO- PLAYING FIELD WORKERS RIGHT NOW. YEAH ISSUE IS WITH NEW- WITH THE NEWLY SKILL IN NEWLY TRAINED- COMING OF COMMUNITY. THEY LIVE HAVE TO WORK IN THE CAN. IN WHICH THEY RESIDE THEY THEY REALLY CAN'T GO ANY PLACE ALL STATE. BECAUSE OF FOR A BUILDING HOUSING IF THEY CAN'T FIND A JOB WITHIN. FIVE OR SIX OR TEN MILES OF THEIR OF THEIR- WHERE THEY RATE YOU KNOW FROM IF THEY WERE DAHLE COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR ANOTHER COMMUNICATOR STAFF TO WORK IN THAT COMMUNITY. AND SO THAT LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF THE NEW WORKERS COMING OUT OF. OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TO BE ABLE TO- BE ABLE TO MIGRATE TO OTHER COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO WORK. IT'S REALLY IT'S REALLY JUST WORKFORCE ISSUE IS REALLY GOING TO BE A PROBLEM FOR MANUFACTURING MOVING DOWN THE LINE BECAUSE- WE'RE NOT A SKILLED WORKER WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO ADOPT TECHNOLOGIES WITHOUT TECHNOLOGIES BUT I CAN BE COMPETITIVE. NO WE'RE NOT COMPETITIVE WE'RE GOING TO LOSE. MANY FACTORS IN THE- I COULD NOT AGREE. WITH YOU MORE I THINK IT IS A KEY. HUGE AND- PRIORITY OTHERS AND I THINK A BI RECOVERY AS WE- AT. IN THE TWO YEARS EVEN TAKE. TECH AND ISN'T. CRIPPLE I YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO ON ON TO WHAT WAS RIGHT TO SAID. I'M SPECIFICALLY YOU YOU IT MEANT. I THINK YOU'RE NUMBER ONE KIND OF LIKE. A PRIORITY WAS FOR ASKING. OUR INVESTMENT. OR TO ACTUALLY START INVESTMENT IN CONTRACT EDUCATION. AGAIN CAN YOU. JUST CAN YOU HELP US OUT- FOR US AND- IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT WOULD DELIVER FOR. AFRICA FOR I'M IN. MY CAR. IN IN YOUR VIEW LIKE WE IS THAT YOUR NUMBER PRIORITY. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU ON A NURSE FIRST AT EVEN THAT QUESTION EVERY APPRECIATE THAT FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO DO. YOU KNOW TO UNDERSTAND THERE IS NO INVESTMENT INTO CONTRACT EDUCATION OUR NUMBER ONE FUNDING SOURCE THAT WE USE RIGHT NOW IS THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL. AND AS AS WAS PRIOR SAID WITH THE DECREASE IN HATE OUR WITH THE DECREASE IN MONEY COMING TO THAT THAT DOES AFFECT ALL OF THE TRAINING ORGANIZATIONS THAT DO NORMALLY RELY ON ETP IN ORDER TO PROVIDE. THAT TRAINING. AND BY INVESTING THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE PLATE BY BEGINNING THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM ON THAT WHAT THAT DOES IS THAT IT ENABLES THE LARGEST. OUR CONTRACT EDUCATION SYSTEM ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO BE ABLE TO TRAIN PEOPLE AT A GREAT PRICE RIGHT NOW. ACCORDING TO THE WORLD ECONOMIC ON ECONOMIC FORUM. BY TWENTY TWENTY TO NO LESS THAN 54% OF ALL EMPLOYEES WILL BRING YOU REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT RE SKILLING AND UP SKILLING. AND IN COURT ACCORDING TO PEW RESEARCH 87% OF WORKERS BELIEVE THAT IT WILL BE ESSENTIAL TO GET TRAINING AND DEVELOP NEW SKILLS THROUGHOUT THEIR WORK LIFE IN ORDER TO KEEP UP WITH THE CHANGES IN THEIR WORK FACED. THAT'S JUST TO STAY COMPETITIVE THIS IS TO KEEP THEIR BUSINESSES COMPETITIVE BUSINESSES ALREADY HAVE A SKILL ISSUE AS WITH A SEDATED BEFORE. IF WE DON'T UPSKILL THESE INDIVIDUALS AND GIVEN THE SKILLS THAT THEY WANT THEY WILL FIND THEIR THAT THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO STATE- COMPETITIVE IN WHAT THEY'RE DOING. AND THEY'LL END UP LOSING THEIR JOBS. ALSO THIS ALSO GIVES OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE FOR ADVANCEMENT WAGE INCREASE IN ITS WHICH OPENS UP THOSE FRONTLINE POSITIONS WHICH WE CAN THEN. BACK FILL WITH INDIVIDUALS THAT NEED TRAINING TO GET TO WORK MANY INDIVIDUALS CAN'T WAIT TWO YEARS TO GET A DEGREE OR FOUR YEARS OR SIX YEARS TO GET. EMPLOYMENT THEY NEED TO HAVE EMPLOYMENT NOW AND THEN THEY CAN TAKE SCHOOLING WHILE THEY'RE EMPLOYED. BUT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO WORKING OUT AND NOT AT A MINIMUM WAGE JOB THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO WORK AT A LIVING WAGE JOB. COMMUNITY COLLEGES ACROSS THE- STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS THE ACCESS TO REACH THEIR COMMUNITIES THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES. ALL ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IT WOULD HELP OUT UNDER TRAINING AGENCIES SUCH AS THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL WE WORK IN TANDEM WITH THAT SUCH AS WITH THE EMPTY SEAT AND WE WORK WITH MANY SECTORS THE- ONE OF THE WEAKNESSES OF THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANELS THERE'S VERY SPECIFIC SECTORS THAT YOU CAN WORK IN AND YOU CAN PROVIDE TRAINING AND BY WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM YOU WE CAN WORK WITH ALL EMPLOYERS WHO ARE NEEDING TO UP SKILL AND RE SKILL THEIR EMPLOYEES. AND NEED TO HIRE FOR THEIR SHORT REALLY OPENS UP THAT SCALE AND- AND WE STILL HAVE THE SAME METRICS THAT WE WORK IN THE SAME ETHICS THAT WE WORK ON. THANK YOU FOR THAT THANK YOU I DO I THINK THAT'S OF A SUPER EXCITING OPPORTUNITY AND JUST WENT ONE LAST QUESTION IF I NAY MADAM CHAIR I'M- IT IS IT'S A LITTLE BIT SIMILAR MAYBE TO THE QUESTION I ASKED OF OUR- EARLIER PANELISTS BIT ODD. CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE CHALLENGES ARE CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO BE UNIQUE YOU NEED FOR CALIFORNIA AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THAT THAT THAT WERE FACING ACROSS THE NATION AND INDEED ACROSS THE WORLD. SO ARE THERE OTHER STATES THAT ARE ARE DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB AT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT OR DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB AT UPSKILLING RETRAINING. OUR WORKERS AND PREPARING THEM FOR THE JOBS OF TOMORROW. IS THERE ANYWAY WE CAN LOOK TO DO IT AS A MODEL. NOT FOR ANY ANY OF THE PANELISTS WHO HAVE A FEW. RIGHT I THINK THERE ARE FEW STATES- FIRST OF ALL CALIFORNIA WITH EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL DOES SET THE STANDARD IN MANY CASES FOR OTHER STATES THERE ARE VERY MANY OTHER STATES THAT DON'T HAPPEN. THIS FORM OF- OF- OF THE WORK FORCE- SUBJECT OF BIRDS ARE SUBSIDIZATION OF THE. I CAN SEE THAT BIG. WILD STATES IN WHICH THEY RESIDE AND OPEN. MUCH LATER ADVANTAGE OF TRAINING AND THEY CAN'T ANOTHER STATE IN WHICH THEY ARE POSSIBLY TEXAS OR ARIZONA OR SOMETHING ELSE. IN TERMS OF THOSE STATES THAT ACTUALLY HAVE- YOU KNOW GOOD GOOD PROGRAMS I THINK NEW JERSEY PROBABLY HAS A GOOD ONE AS I AS I REMEMBER. IN IN LOOKING AT SOME OF THIS- THEY THEY DO A NICE JOB BECAUSE THEY DO A TERRIFIC JOB OF CONNECTING- THE EDUCATIONAL- OF YOU KNOW LIKE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND UNIVERSITIES TO INDUSTRY ANY ANY OF ANY ORGANIZATION THAT CAN DO THAT- IS REALLY DOING A GOOD JOB AND THEN I THINK NEW JERSEY ALSO SUPPORTS IT WAS SOME KIND OF FUNDING. IN TERMS OF APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE BECAUSE THIS IS THIS IS. THIS IS A MULTIPLE TYPE PROGRAM NOT ONLY DO NEW DGP- NOT ONLY DO DENTURE TECHNICAL COURAGE OCCASION YOU NEED AN APPRENTICE PROGRAM AS WELL IN WHICH WE CAN PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR MANUFACTURERS TO BRING IN. YOUNGER HIGHLY SKILLED WORKERS TO LEARN ABOUT MANUFACTURING IN IN OU KNOW GETTING TRAINED IN THE CULTURE OF MANUFACTURING. AND BE ABLE TO BE THE NEXT GENERATION OF THE WORKERS IT'S GOING TO TAKE US. TAKE OUR WHOLE MANUFACTURING COMMUNITY. INTO THE FUTURE SO. THAT'S A LONG ANSWER BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT CALIFORNIA WITH ITS IMPORTANT TRAINING PANEL IS KIND OF A- LOT. YOU DO. HAVE TYPES OF. THAT THEY THAT GREAT NOT AT A TRAINING ADVANTAGE FOR A WORKER BUT ALSO. FOR WORKERS IS. MISTER INTEREST IN THE INTERESTED AND WHEN HE GOT AND TURN IT OVER. TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER OR HER AND THEN I COME FROM WITH ONE QUESTION. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I'LL TRY TO MAKE THIS CHRIS QUICK- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS KNOW THE PENDING. AND IS THAT IT REALLY HIGHLIGHTED THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF LONG- SUPPLY CHAINS FOR OUR MANUFACTURING SECTOR. SO WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO HAVE MORE ON SHORING OF MANUFACTURING. AND WE KNOW WE HAVE AN AND NOT ONLY HAVE I HAVE. IS THERE MORE TO DO BEFORE THAT. TO CREATE THE SKILLED WORKERS WORK FORCE FOR MANUFACTURING. BUT WE ALSO NOW HAVE A LARGE SECTOR OF. UNEMPLOYED FROM HOSPITALITY FROM RETAIL FROM RESTAURANTS. SO MY QUESTION AND IT GOES BACK TO MISTER WATSON WHAT YOU WERE SAYING IS WE NEED TO BE BETTER AT BRIDGING. THAT THE JOB SKILL NEEDS AND THE TRAINING THAT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES OR OUR OTHER PROGRAMS CAN PROVIDE. IT IF YOU COULD GIVE ME YOU IT MAYBE- MISS- CRAVEABLE CAN GIVE US. THE TOP THREE THINGS THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO TO BRIDGE THOSE PROGRAMS ARE NOT ONLY DO WE COME UP TO. A GOOD LEVEL BUT WERE ABLE TO INCREASE AND ABSORB SOME OF THAT AND IT TREAT RETRAIN SOME OF THOSE UNEMPLOYED WORKERS. THE TOP ONE TWO THREE THINGS WE SHOULD DO. GO WELL I THINK FIRST NEWS IS AFTER IS TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR- INCOME TRAINING AND FOR- APPRENTICE TRAINING WOULD BE WOULD BE TO TALK TO FOR ME- I THINK I THINK THOSE ARE THE AREAS THAT I THINK WE CAN IN TERMS OF CITIES IN MANUFACTURING WE CAN CERTAINLY- BUT A LOT OF. STUDENTS IN THOSE TWO AREAS. IF WE HAD THE FUNDING AND IF WE COULD GO OUT AND WORK WITH MANUFACTURERS TO BE ABLE O- TAKE NEW WORKERS OUT OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. AND EXTREME AFTER. WE GET WE NEED TO GET THIS BRIDGE AND THEN FROM THERE I KNOW I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SIGN ON. HOW THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THE RETRAINING- THEIR STUDENTS BUT I KNOW MOST OF TWO STUDENTS TRAINED IN MANUFACTURING. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET THEM OUT INTO THE. MANUFACTURING COMMUNITY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. I WOULD LIKE TO- ADD ON. ON TO THAT THAT. MANUFACTURES WON'T COME BACK WITHOUT A SKILLED WORKFORCE STATE THE BILL ONLY COME BACK IF WE HAVE THAT SKILLED WORKFORCE. SO AGAIN. A GREEN SPENDING IS THE NUMBER ONE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO. TRAIN THESE INDIVIDUALS. AND PUT THEM TO WORK WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONVINCE MANUFACTURERS THAT WE HAVE A SKILLED. WORKFORCE THE- THE OTHER IS ACCESS TO SOFTWARE. THERE'S MANY GREAT SOFTWARE. PLATFORMS THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT WE CAN USE AGAIN FUNDING TO GET ACCESS TO THOSE TAX SOFTWARE. PLATFORMS THAT WE CAN WORK IN A HYBRID WORLD OR VIRTUAL WORLDS WHICH EVER ONE REGARDLESS OF HOW YOU LOOK AT IT. AT LATIMES SOFTWARE HELPS US TO BECOME SAFETY BEFORE WE DO ACTUAL HANDS ON ACTIVITIES. AND THEN I WOULD SAY ONE OTHER ASPECT THAT WE HAVEN'T REALLY TALKED ABOUT HERE AND I WOULD SAY THE THIRD ONE WOULD BE. BUSINESS IS ACCEPTING JUSTICE INVOLVED INDIVIDUALS BACKGROUNDS. ON IT IS IMPORTANT FOR BUSINESSES TO BE OPEN TO INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BACKGROUNDS IF WE'RE TRYING TO SUCCESSFULLY REINTEGRATE THEM INTO BACK INTO SOCIETY. THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO WORK AND IF THE MORE BUSINESSES THAT TELLEM NOW NOT ONLY CONTINUES TO PUT THEM INTO ONE DIRECTION AND THAT IS TO BACK TO RESET UPDATE AND GO BACK TO PRISON. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WEAK IN Q. INCLUDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR JUSTICE AND BACH WE INVEST IN TO UP SKILLING AND RE SKILLING ARE INDIVIDUALS AND ASK MR WATSON ALSO SAID. COME UP WITH SOME SORT OF APPRENTICESHIP OR PATHWAY THAT HELPS INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE GETTING TRAINED IN MANUFACTURING ARE GETTING TRAINED IN DISTRIBUTION HAVE A PATHWAY DIRECTLY INTO THOSE INDUSTRIES THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES WE HAD WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY. EMPLOYMENT BRIDGE PROGRAM THAT WE DID WORK WITH A SPECIFIC WE WORK WITH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS COMPANY. AND THEY HAD OUR COLLEGE- STUDENTS GO THROUGH A SPECIFIC PROGRAM ON LEARNING HOW TO WORK ON A NEED. BECAUSE THEY LEARNED HOW TO WORK ON DIFFERENT EQUIPMENT AT COLLEGE BUT THEY NEVER LEARNED HOW TO WORK ON A METER CHAU CONTRACT EDUCATION CAME IN TO BRIDGE THAT GAP WE TOOK THESE COLLEGE STUDENTS WERE GIVEN THE METER. AND THEY WERE ABLE TO GO OUT AND. GET AN ACTUAL JOB WITH SOUTHERN CAL CORNIA GAS COMPANY SO TEMPLE.-THAT AS WE LOOK AT THE PRO. D. THE IN. IS IN WITH THE TRAIN THAT WE'RE DESIGNING AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CONTRACT EDUCATE EDUCATION IS VERY GOOD AT. CMT C. IS A WONDERFUL PARTNER WITH WITH THE CONTRACT EDUCATION UNITS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEY WORK SPECIFICALLY WITH MANUFACTURING. THEY ALSO WORK ON LINE- IDENTIFYING THOSE DIFFERENT NEEDS WE WORK IN TANDEM WITH ONE ANOTHER ON THEIR- MULTIPLE EMPLOYER PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMME. THESE ARE SOME ISSUES THAT DATA STATEWIDE WE SEE AND IF WE CAN NUMBER ONE FUNDING NUMBER TO FUNDING IN NUMBER THREE FUNDING. IF WE HAVE THE SPENDING ASPECTS WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE WITH THE SKILLED WORKFORCE THAT THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS. OUR CRIME LET ME LET ME JUST JUMP IN HERE TOO AND THIS SEGMENT OF THE AGENDA I MISSED ONE QUESTION DO YOU HAVE ANY WORDS OF ADVICE TO OTHER ORGANIZATIONS TRYING TO SERVE SMALL BUSINESSES DURING THE PANDEMIC. I MEAN I WOULDN'T PRESUME TO GIVE UNSOLICITED ADVICE PARTNERS BUT IF I AND I THINK THAT WHAT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED BY THE PANELISTS TODAY- IS REALLY AND DEMONSTRATIVE OF WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING ESPECIALLY SINCE BECAUSE THE NINETEEN BUT BEFORE AND THAT IS WORKING TOGETHER AND PARTNERING. BECAUSE WE SIMPLY CANNOT BE EXPERTS IN EVERYTHING FOR EVERYONE SO YOU KNOW STAYING IN YOUR LANE AND FINDING THOSE EXPERTS LIKE THE MANUFACTURERS- THE FOLKS WHO WORK IN WORKFORCE- OUR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS THE SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTERS WHO CAN HELP BRIDGE THAT DIGITAL DIVIDE- HELP SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO MIGHT NOT. BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE TPP LONER. NOW HAD- I THINK PARTNERING IS PROBABLY THE NUMBER ONE THING AND MAKING SURE THAT FOLKS CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND THINK CREATIVELY IN THOSE PARTNERSHIPS IS. SUPER IMPORTANT.

GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH MY NAME'S MATT SATIN WITH A CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION AND WE REPRESENT. COUNTLESS COMMUNITY RESTAURANTS INDEPENDENT RESTAURANTS THROUGHOUT YOUR DISTRICTS AND I JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR HAVING THE HEARING AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOCUS ON THESE. ISSUES I THINK AS WE KNOW IN THE MIDST OF THE- PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS THAT EMERGE LAST MARCH THE STATE'S AGGRESSIVE AND NECESSARY STEPS TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH. AND SAFETY OF THE STATE'S RESIDENTS. UNFORTUNATELY THOSE TRADE OFFS FOR THOSE PROTECTED PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES I HAVE HAD A NEAR DESTINATION IMPACT ON OUR STREETS RESTAURANT COMMUNITY. SAID THE RESTAURANT ECONOMIC CRISIS CONTINUES TO RAPIDLY TAKE HOLD. WE BELIEVE THE STATE'S GOT NAVIGATION TO TAKING EQUALLY AGGRESSIVE STEPS TO ADDRESS THE ECONOMIC HARM. AND WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN SO FAR FOR SHORT TERM RELIEF IN THE GRANT PROGRAMS AND BELIEVE THEIR GREAT START. AS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA'S RESTAURANTS OF THE CORNERSTONE OF EVERY COMMUNITY THROUGHOUT YOUR DISTRICTS YOU SEE MANY OF INDEPENDENT RESTAURANTS THAT MAKE UP THE FABRIC OF YOUR COMMUNITY. THE FOR THE PANDEMIC SHUTDOWNS THERE OF ONE POINT FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS WORKING IN RESTAURANTS. JUST SINCE MARCH AN ESTIMATED NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO ONE MILLION OF THEM HAVE EITHER BEEN LAID OFF FOR ABOUT. RESTAURANT SECTORS DEFINITELY BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE STATE'S NINETY THOUSAND RESTAURANT LOCATIONS ARE OWNED AND OPERATED BY INDEPENDENT PROVIDERS IN YOUR COMMUNITIES. ADDITIONALLY 60% OF CALIFORNIANS RESTAURANTS ARE OWNED BY PEOPLE OF COLOR. WHEN IT COMES TO REALLY PROGRAMS INTENDED TO HELP WE ASK YOU TO CONSIDER A FEW THINGS THAT ARE UNIQUE TO THE RESTAURANT COMMUNITY. ONE WE WERE ONE OF THE LARGEST EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE SAID WE ARE PEOPLE HAPPY AND MORE PROUD OF THAT. RESTAURANT LABOR COSTS ARE HIGHER THAN ELSEWHERE IN THE NATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE BELIEVE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANTS BEEN SHUT LONGER THAN ANY OTHER EMPLOYMENT SECTOR NATIONWIDE. MY MAIN POINT HERE IS JUST THAT RESTAURANTS HAVE HIGH NUMBERS OF EMPLOYEES. WHICH DOESN'T NECESSARILY REFLECT BIG BUSINESS VERSUS SMALL BUSINESS. AS RESTAURANTS WITH EVEN ONE TWO OR THREE LOCATIONS CAN QUICKLY ADD UP TO LOTS OF EMPLOYEES. SINCE THE PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAMS BEEN CITED HERE A FEW TIMES IN THIS HEARING I WANTED TO JUST POINT OUT A FEW THINGS. CALIFORNIA RESTAURANTS RECEIVED P. P. LOANS THAT EXCEEDED THE NATIONAL AVERAGE LOAN SIZE OF A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR TWO REASONS. ONE LOAN AMOUNTS ARE BASED ON LABOR COSTS WHICH TYPICALLY ACCOUNT FOR MORE THAN HALF OF THE RESTAURANTS COMES. INTO CALIFORNIA RESTAURANTS EXPERIENCED ABOVE AVERAGE LOSSES GIVEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITED. OR IN MOST CASES PROHIBITED SAID INDOOR DINING AND MUCH OF THE STATE'S IN SPOTS MUST MARCH. ONE OF THE KEY OBJECTIVES OF THAT TV PROGRAMS TO ENCOURAGE RECIPIENTS KEEP EMPLOYEES ON THE PAYROLL. NO ANSWER GIVEN AT THE RESTAURANT SPENT AT LEAST BIGGER LOANS IN BOCA THAT MONEY FLOW THROUGH TO WORKERS HAS INTENDED. SO AGAIN THE NUMBER OF RESTAURANT EMPLOYEES OR SIGNS OF A RESTAURANT LOAN DOES NOT NECESSARILY CORRELATE TO WHETHER A RESTAURANT IS BIG OR SMALL OR UNSTABLE ECONOMIC FOOTING. THE NEST MAJORITY THE STATE'S RESTAURANT JOBS ARE INSIDE THE RESTAURANT DINING ROOMS OF ALL KINDS. THOSE THAT MENTION REMAIN CLOSED IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE COUNTIES. SO SOMETHING TO CONSIDER WHEN THE STATE BEGINS TO AUTHORIZE COUNTIES TO ALLOW US BACK INSIDE I JUST REMIND YOU THAT THE RE OPENING WILL ONLY BE COUNTY BY COUNTY AND WILL UNDER THE STATE'S CURRENT TIERED REOPENING SYSTEM. NOT GET TO A POINT THAT ALLOWS US TO HAVE GREATER THAN 50% IN DROUGHT STRICKEN CITY. AND FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE MOST KILLINGS WILL BE LUCKY TO GET AUTHORIZED TO OUT 25% OCCUPANCY ENDORSE. BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET. SO THE RESULT. IS A FORCE LIMITATION OF OUR OPERATIONS AND THE BEST ONE DATA 50% OPERATIONS ALLOWED. YET WILL STILL HAVE A 100% OF OUR FIX DAILY COSTS RENTS. INSURANCE AND OTHER COSTS. AS REACHED HERE EARLIER ON ONE OF YOUR PANEL THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT SOME EMPLOYMENT SECTORS HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC SHUT DOWNS. THAN OTHERS AND RESTAURANTS STAND OUT UNDOUBTEDLY. SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR FOCUS ON THESE ISSUES AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR FOCUS ON SMALL BUSINESS AND DEFINITELY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THE LEGISLATURE ON THESE THINGS IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU. NINE FORTY FIVE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. WELL GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS ANNE RAFFERTY AND I AM THE DIRECTOR IF YOU COLLEGE AND A MEMBER OF THE BILL CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE COLLABORATIVE AND I SUPPORT THE NEEDS- MY COLLEAGUE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR DEANNA KREHBIEL SHARED EARLIER.

IS CRITICAL TO ADDRESSING NOT FUEL REDUCTION AND WORKER TRAINING CALIFORNIA. I AND SUPPORT OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES. A QUESTION EARLIER AROUND HOW CALIFORNIA AND IN OTHER STATES ARE PARTICIPATING TOGETHER I WAS RECENTLY ATTENDING EIGHT U. S. PRE APPRENTICESHIP MEETING WITH NORTH CAROLINA TEXAS AND PENNSYLVANIA REPRESENTATIVE. AND I FOUND QUICKLY THAT THE OTHER STATES ARE WATCHING CALIFORNIA AND THIS PROGRAM AND PARTICULARLY A CLOSE. THE CALIFORNIA CAN TAKE THE LEAD FOR YOU ARE WITH OUR UPSKILL CALIFORNIA CONTRACT EDUCATION UNITS. IF WE ARE FUNDED TO CONTINUE THIS TYPE OF CRITICAL TRAINING SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE MEETING TODAY. NINE FORTY SIX YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. YES THANK YOU THIS IS CLAUDIA VK AND I AM THE ADVOCATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S BUSINESS CENTER NETWORK OF SIXTEEN CENTERS SERVING NINETEEN LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. FOURTEEN OF THESE CENTERS RECEIVED STATE FUNDING THROUGH THE GOBIZ HATE THAT THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE EXPANSION PROJECT THAT YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH. NOW I KNOW YOU'RE ALL AWARE OF THE DISPROPORTIONATE AND NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC ON WOMEN AND HOW THEY HAVE BEEN LEAVING THE WORK FORCE IN DROVES SHOULD TO CARE FOR CHILDREN- AND TO- YOU KNOW BASICALLY. TRY TO CREATE INCOME FROM HOME. BUT WHAT YOU MAY NOT BE AWARE OF IS THE CRITICAL ROLE THAT WOMEN'S BUSINESS CENTERS ARE NOW PLAYING IN HELPING WOMEN'S BUSINESS OWNERS READ REPOSITION THEIR BUSINESSES. GET THE RESOURCES IN CAPITAL THEY NEED AND THE TRAINING IN- ONLINE TRAINING THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER TO IT'S A BIG PIECE OF THAT. AND ALSO- THEREBY CREATE MORE HOUSEHOLD INCOME. WE RECENTLY COLLECTED DATA ON THE IMPACTS OF FOURTEEN CENTERS IN TWENTY TWENTY. AND THIS REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SERVICES TO WOMEN OWNED BUSINESS CHANGE. NINE THOUSAND BUSINESSES COURSES STAINED INCLUDING MANY NEWSTART AT. AS WOMEN OF NECESSITY ARE CREATING WAYS TO GENERATE NEW INCOME IN THEIR HOMES. THIS REPRESENTED A YEAR'S SERVICE FIGURES. THESE MICRO BUSINESSES GENERATED THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION AND REVENUES. AND THE WOMEN'S BUSINESS CENTERS LEVERAGED FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN NEW CAPITAL FOR THEIR CLIENTS WHICH WITH A 120% INCREASE OVER LAST YEAR SHE- THIS- INCREASE REALLY RELATE SO MUCH TO WHAT BIANCA BLANC WHICH WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER IN HER PRESENTATION IS A CRITICAL NEED A SMALL BUSINESSES TO HAVE ACCESS TO CAPITAL NOW. WE ARE REACHING THE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES IN PARTICULAR 53% OF THE PLANS OF WOMEN'S BUSINESS CENTERS ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR. IN 55% ARE FROM LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS- EARLIER DR FAIRLY MANSION THE IMPORT MULTIPLIER EFFECT OF SMALL BUSINESSES SO LET'S% REMEMBER THAT THE SMALL WOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS ARE CIRCULATING THEIR REVENUES MORE THAN TWO TIMES IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. SO WHEN YOU THINK OF ECONOMIC RECOVERY YOU'VE GOT TO BE THINKING OF WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS. WOMEN'S BUSINESS CENTERS ARE SUPPORTING THESE ENTREPRENEURS TO SUSTAIN AND THRIVE DURING THE PANDEMIC YOU WERE ABLE TO DO THIS BECAUSE OF AUGMENTED FUNDING FROM THE CARES FACT IN FROM THE STATE TAKE FUNDS. BUT A SECURE THAT FUNDING WINDS DOWN AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND WE WILL BE COMING TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO CONTINUE CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY.
