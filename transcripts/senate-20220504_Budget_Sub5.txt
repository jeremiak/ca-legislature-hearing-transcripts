YES GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR- CHARLES ONE. DEPUTY SECRETARY BUDGET MINISTRATION TRANSPORTATION AGENCY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE SUBCOMMITTEE. INSTRUCTION IS NOT HAVE A POSITION ON SENATE TRANSPORTATION PROPOSAL THIS TIME HOWEVER I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESTATEMENTS RATIONS POSITION ON ANY POTENTIAL TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE. ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION CONTINUES TO BE THAT ANY FUNDING INCLUDED FOR THE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE WILL BE CONTINGENT UPON RECEIVING AN APPROPRIATION FOR THE HIGH SPEED RAIL WHICH IS NOTABLY NOT INCLUDED IN THE SENATE'S PROPOSAL WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF ON THIS PARTICULAR PACKAGE FOR THE STATE'S INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE. THANK YOU. OKAY. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR QUAN- NOW WILL HAVE SOME COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM OUR OUR COMMITTEE SENATORS WHO WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO FIRST I'M JUST A STORY I DO APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION POSITIONS RELATES TO FUNNY RICE THE ROUTE I HOPE IT'S A TOPIC THAT WE CAN. DISCUSS IN ARRIVE AT BETTER REASONABLE POSITION IN PLAN FOR- CALIFORNIA THAT. GREAT I'M ALL JUST A FEW MINUTES A FEW THINGS HERE- I REALLY- BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY THAT TRANSPORTATION HAS TO BE A PRIORITY THIS YEAR NOT TO SAY IT HASN'T BEEN IMPORTANT IN THE PAST- TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE HAVE A COME TO US. EACH EXPRESSING ENORMOUS NEED OUT IN THE FIELD OF TRANSPORTATION ONE ONE FACET OR ANOTHER- AND I TRULY BELIEVE THAT NOW'S THE TIME TO MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS WE HAVE THE FUNDING- FOR FROM THE STATE. OF THERE'S IDEAL JOB CREATING OPPORTUNITIES AND THE MORE MONEY WE PUT IN THE MORE WE CAN GET POTENTIALLY FROM FEDERAL FUNDS OF SO I THINK GETTING HAVING THE LEVERAGE OF FEDERAL FUNDS OUGHT TO FINISHED PRODUCTS THERE ARE PROJECTS THAT ARE- THAT ARE OUT THERE AND THAT. ALL IMPORTANT AGAIN EVERYWHERE FROM THE INLAND EMPIRE TO BAY AREA- SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ORANGE COUNTY- A NUMBER OF- OF AGENCIES HAVE COME TO US WITH THEIR REQUEST OF. THE OTHER PART OF THIS- I THINK PROPOSAL- FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO BE SPENT IS THAT CONSTRUCTION JOBS WILL BE HIGH QUALITY WAGES AND BENEFITS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE LABOR STANDARDS IN THERE THAT MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S THE INVESTMENT ON THE BUSINESS SIDE BUT ACTUALLY INVESTMENT. ON THE OFF WORKING FAMILIES SITE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE GOOD WITH BENEFITS AND- WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WHILE WE HAVE FAR MORE EXPERIENCE ALL WITH THE CONSTRUCTION SIDE WITH PLA'S AND COMMUNITY WORKFORCE AGREEMENTS WE NEED TO ALSO- MOVE THAT INTO OUR OTHER. INVESTMENTS AND WE NEED ENFORCEABLE- COMMITMENTS A TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT A TRICKLE DOWN BUT IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO BE PATHWAYS TO GOOD PAYING IN DEMAND JOBS- AND THAT'S WHAT OF- SENATE TRANSPORTATION PACKAGE- INCLUDES AS WELL. SO WITH THAT- I DON'T KNOW SENATE QUARTERS IF YOU HAD SOME OTHER COMMENTS PLEASE. YES IN IN THE PRIOR. HEARING I REALLY I MADE COMMENTS SAID I WOULD PROBABLY JUST MAKE IT AGAIN TODAY BUT- I'LL TRY TO SORT OF MINIMIZE THE COMMENTARY A COUPLE QUESTIONS ONE- IN THE. THE DISTRIBUTION ON THE ON THE CHART IN THE OF THE PACKAGE OF THE BREAKDOWN I GUESS WHICH CALL IT- THE ONE POINT TWO FIVE BILLION FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TRANSIT PROJECTS HOW IS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BEING DEFINED- IN TERMS OF JURISDICTIONS INCLUDED SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW I KNOW IT'S NOT THE LAYMAN'S VERSION OF ANYTHING SOUTH OF- THE GRAPEVINE BUT YOU KNOW I GUESS I'M I JUST REALLY WANTING FROM A JURISDICTIONAL STANDPOINT BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME PRETTY BIG COUNTIES IN ENTITIES DOWN THERE ON PARTS TO THIS WOULD BE ON THE CHART I'M LOOKING AT THE CHART IN. ALL THE ADMINISTRATION OKAY THAT'S WHAT I DID WRONG MRS MINISTRATION OF THE SENATE SIDE. RATED MINISTRATION PROPOSAL OKAY SO WAIT WOULD YOU RATHER ME WAIT YEAH BUT I'M I'M JUST HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THIS REALLY ISSUE SEVENTEEN THAT I'M PICKING THE CHARTER YES YES IT'S ISSUE SEVENTEEN AND THE CHART IN YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL RIGHT GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED OKAY SO THAT MEANS- MISTER QUANT. YES THANK YOU. SO WE ARE PROPOSAL WOULD REALLY IN RESPONSE TO PREVIOUS- COMMENTS AND BEEN MADE ABOUT- NECESSARILY FIND NECESSARY FUNDING FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TRANSIT PROJECTS I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE THAT SPECIFICALLY DEFINES- ANYWHERE IN STATUTE OR ANYTHING BUT- WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF TO DEFINE- BUT THE DEFINITION OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE APPRECIATE THAT I THINK YOU KNOW WE ARE AND ALSO WE- YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE WAY WERE ORGANIZED IN THE SENATE COMING BACK TO THE SENATE SIDE OF THINGS WE YOU KNOW A LOT OF THIS INFRASTRUCTURE. PACKAGE IF YOU WILL HAS BEEN- LOOKED UP BY CAUCUS UNITED BAY AREA CAUCUSES GOT ITS LANDS INLAND EMPIRE'S GOT ITS LANDS SACRAMENTO'S GOT ITS LANDS AND IT'S ALL IT'S ALL BEEN TALKED ABOUT ALREADY. BUT BUT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE WE'RE CARING FOR THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. NOMENCLATURE ON THAT PIECE OF ON THAT LEADS IN AND THEY JUST. YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH I SEE IN MY OWN NOTES ON THE SENATE PACKAGE YOU KNOW AND I DON'T KNOW. IF THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PRESENTATION TODAY BUT HAVING SAN DIEGO KIND OF BROKEN OUT SEPARATELY THESE ARE MY NOTES HERE- I SHOW I SHOW SAN DIEGO WITH A NUMBER. SEPARATE APART OVER AND ABOVE WHAT WOULD BE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT THERE'S NO IF YOU COME BACK TO. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PACKAGE THERE IS NO SAN DIEGO NUMBER SERVICE I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE WERE. WE'RE APPLES TO APPLES- OR I AM AT LEAST IN TERMS OF MY OWN UNDERSTANDING OF. WHERE WE WERE OR WHERE WHERE MAYBE WE WERE AS A STARTING POINT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S- PACKAGE A RECOMMENDATION AND THEN. HOW THAT TRANSLATES OVER WITHOUT- YOU KNOW ACTON ME WORRIED ABOUT US CONFLATING. OR OR PACKAGING AND THINGS TOGETHER THAT I SHOULD BE DOING- SO THAT THAT'S THE QUESTION AND. I HEARD THE ANSWER TO IT IS. IT SOUNDED KIND OF LIKE WE DON'T KNOW- BUT I GUESS FOR ALL OF US I JUST FEEL LIKE IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT GET CLARITY ON THAT SOONER RATHER THAN LATER ANGRY- ANGRY LASTLY IN THE MINISTRATIONS. PACKAGE THAT'S WERE I'M SORRY THIS IN THE SENATE PACKAGE IS IT WHAT IS. ME SINCE THAT'S ON THE TABLE RIGHT NOW WITH. WHAT IS THE- CONCEPT BASICALLY BY THE PRESENTERS IN TERMS OF- HOW THAT MONEY IS DISTRIBUTED- WE FOCUSED IN EARLY ON AND IF YOU WERE TO GO BACK AND PLAY BACK THE TAPE OF MY COMMENTS FOR THE LAST YEAR IN ON T. R. C. P. PER DECISION AND THE FACT THAT I'M I WAS JUST SAYING AT THE TIME IT SEEMED LIKE THAT DOLLAR AMOUNT WAS TOO LOW RELATIVE TO STATEWIDE NEED IN THE WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY AND- I STAND BY ALL THOSE COMMENTS. YOU KNOW I'M GLAD THAT WERE. STARTING TO DEAL WITH SOME LARGER NUMBERS HERE- YOU KNOW AVAILABLE BECAUSE OF THE BENEFIT OF THE SIZE OF THE STATE BUDGET- BUT THAT SAID- I'M I'M STILL NOT CLEAR ON. FORMULA VERSUS- IDENTIFYING PROJECTS YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS IN MY OFFICE AS YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEAL WITH LEGACY PROJECTS BUT AT THE SAME TIME OBVIOUSLY THERE SEEMED THERE WOULDN'T BE TYPICALLY NEED TO BE MONEY. DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE EMPTY OWES OR THROUGH THE FORMULAS LIKE T. I. R. C. P. AS WELL- IMAGES WERE AND HOW MUCH THAT'S BEEN REFINED AT THIS POINT. IN A NOTE THE PRESENTERS CAN RESPOND TO THAT. OR WHO WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO RESPOND TO IT. HE. I THINK SIMILAR AT AND YOU CAN SEE I THINK IN THE IN THE IN THE SUMMARY OF THE SENATE'S OF- SOME DESCRIPTION HERE OF WHAT OUR PROPOSAL IS ONE I THINK WE WERE FOCUSED ON FIRST AND FOREMOST PUTTING MRE MONEY INTO THE TRANSPORTATION BUDGET AND- AND MAKING SURE THAT WE TAKE ADVANTAGE LIKE I SAID OF A FEDERAL FUNDING IN THE LEVERAGING OF FEDERAL DOLLARS SO THAT WAS I THINK THE FIRST THING WE WANTED TO ACCOMPLISH OF. WAITING GET INTO PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS- BUT I THINK THAT- ANY ALL THESE. QUESTIONS THAT YOU'RE ASKING WE SHOULD. ADDRESS THEM I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE THE SPECIFIC RESPONSE TO EACH ONE HERE BUT I THINK THEY'RE COMPLETELY VALID VERY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT WE DO NEED TO ANSWER. SO MAYBE CENTER CRITICIZE YOU COULD YOU KNOW GIVE US ALL YOUR QUESTIONS IF YOU WANT RIGHT NOW WELL IN THAT WAY THAT WAY WE WILL HAVE A MEN WE'LL HAVE OUR- CONSULTANT- GET BACK TO ALL OF US. AS TO WHERE AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE THOSE THOSE ISSUES A LONG RIGHT ARM IN MAYBE IT DIDN'T AND IN THAT THAT'S GREAT CONTACTS AND IT'S VERY HELPFUL ITHINK THEN I WOULD JUST SORT OF SUMMARIZE MY QUESTIONS IN IN MORE OF A GENERAL WAY AND SAY. THAT IT SEEMS CLEAR TO ME AND IN THE ANALYSIS WOULD GO TO MY OWN OFFICE SAID THESE. THAT THOSE THE QUESTIONS I STARTED TO ASK OR ACTUALLY INTERTWINED OR SO. CAN I- ARE IMPACTED BY ONE ANOTHER THAT YOU KNOW. AGAIN I THINK WE DO NEED TO CLEAR THOSE UP I'M CERTAINLY- HELLO WE'VE BEEN INVOLVED WE'VE BEEN ENGAGED IN THE CONVERSATION OF MY CHEAPEST OF HOUSES WELL SO. SO MAYBE MORE THAN ANYTHING I'M KIND OF PUTTING OUT HERE ON THE RECORD WHAT I THINK ARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE- WOULD LIKE TO KEEP WORKING ON TO MAKE SURE WE'RE CLEAR ON IF WE DON'T. IF WE DON'T HAVE- WE ARE CLEAR ON THE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS THAT- ARE GOING TO GET- SPECIFIC ALLOCATIONS AT SOME POINT IF THEY ARE- BUT- YOU KNOW. THAT THAT COULD HAVE- SORT OF THE BALANCE OF THE DOLLARS IMPACT ON ON ANYTHING DISTRIBUTED BY FORMULA FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT- SO ANYWAY WE'RE WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN CONTINUING TO GET TO THAT KIND OF DETAIL- IN. BEGIN YOU KNOW IF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA QUESTION IS JUST SORT OF THE- THE JUMPING OUT THERE IS ARTICULATING- YOU KNOW THAT QUESTION IF WE IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT FIGURED OUT THEN THE WHAT HAPPENS- TWO TWO DOLLARS IN THE PACKAGE THAT OR- YOU KNOW. REMAINING ON THAT WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED ELSEWHERE SO THAT'S ALL THAT'S ONLY HELP ON THAT A MANAGER IN WILL THAT YOU BRING ALONG WITH THE AGENDA. GREAT THANK YOU FOR LINKING TO THANK YOU AND IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL. QUESTIONS OFTEN MAKE SURE OF YET NO NO MAKE SURE WE GET THEM EITHER HERE OR- IN NOT IN WRITING TO A CONSULTANT AND I JUST I WONDER I OPENED SO IT'S PART OF THE ITEMS FOR DISCUSSION SEVENTEEN RIGHT NOW UNDERSTOOD UNDERSTOOD SO AS A WITNESS WE HAVE. A OF THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING MONIES AND SO YOU WE HAVE A LARGE AMOUNT THAT WE'VE- PROSPECTIVELY ALLOCATED TO INCREASE THE GOVERNOR SURE THINKING THE UP TO TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE A. T. P. PROGRAM- WHO- AND- THERE ARE AS I UNDERSTAND IT THERE TOO SERIOUS BUT ONE WOULD BE- TO DO A NEW ROUND. OF PROPOSALS- YOUR STORY STRAIGHT FROM SCRATCH THE OTHER WHICH I. I WOULD FAVOR CONSIDERING THE WORK THAT WENT INTO LAST YEAR- IT WOULD BE TO EXTEND THE- THE- AWARDS DOWN. TO PROJECT THAT IT SCORED THAT IT MISSED OUT BECAUSE OF THEIR SCORE IN LAST TIME AND THE ON THE ONE HAND THAT WOULD. SAVE A BUNCH OF STAFF TIME- I THINK I THINK THEY WERE THERE WERE A NUMBER. OF RELIEF- YOU KNOW VALID PROPOSALS I GREW PRINCIPLES THAT DIDN'T MAKE THE CUT OFF LAST TIME- AND SO IF AND WHEN WE DO MAKE A LARGER ALLOCATION THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE MY RECOMMENDATION- TO SIMPLY TAKE. YOU KNOW THE PREVIOUS GROUP OF. APPLICATIONS AND THEN- YOU KNOW APPLY THE NEW MONIES AND FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW WHICH OF THOSE WOULD MAKE THE GRADE. VENTURA DE SEGUIR. CHANGE THANK YOU.

THANK YOU MISTER SCOTT OF DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. METHODIST SENIOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- WE FULLY SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THE L. A. O. L. A. O. MISS ROW. ENGAGE SHARE I WE HAVE NO ISSUES WITH PROPOSAL. HEY RICH IS MOVING RIGHT ALONG HERE- MEMBERS YES PLEASE GO HAVE A REALLY MY QUESTION WOULD THE POWER PRCESS YOU WHAT THE ACRONYM HELSTON FOR. HELLO SIR I HAVE A POOR RECORD. RUBLE LIFECYCLE ITSELF RIGHT PROCESS SUPPORTED BY CD CDT THE COMPANY PHARMACOLOGY TO REQUIREMENTS AND WE GO THROUGH I THINK IT IT HAS OF LEGISLATIVE ORANGE- PROJECTS CONFIDED AND ANTECEDENT THANK YOU. WELCOME GOT IT HELLO BERMAN OKAY NOPE NOT NOT ON THIS ISSUE SEARCH LOCAL HAD. THANK YOU MEASURE IT THERE'S ALL FOUR OF US ACRONYMS IN THE ON THIS PARTICULAR PAGE ONLY WHEN I REALLY RECOGNIZES DMB. OF COULD YOU GIVE JUST MAYBE A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF THE CONTENT THAT YOU WOULD BE CONSOLIDATED IN A SINGLE REPOSITORY IN RIGHT THERE'S GENERAL DESCRIPTIONS AND ACRONYMS IN HERE- IT OBVIOUSLY WE ALL KNOW A DMV DOES BUT- I'M JUST. YOU SURE SENATE MANY TAKE THAT STEVE GORDON DIRECTOR OUR MOTOR VEHICLES ALL THE GIANTS FOR THE PREVIOUS YEAR AND ACRONYMS AND OTHERS IN THERE GETS ITS STATE BUSINESS SO WE USE A LOT WHAT THE WHAT THE SYSTEM IS SEEKING TO DO IS FAIRLY COMMON IN IN IN THE TECHNOLOGY WORLD THE ON THE AREA THAT YOU COME FROM I COME FROM ACTUALLY FROM YOUR DISTRICT BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS THAT EACH ONE OF THE SILOS OF THE ENVY OF BEEN BUILT ON THEIR OWN FOUNDATION AND WHAT ENTERPRISE CONTENT MANAGEMENT DOES IT ALLOWS US TO. REACH AND FEDERATE A DRIVER SAFETY PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE THAT ADMINISTERS HEARING FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN CAUGHT UP IN IMPROPER DRIVING BEHAVIOR WITH OUR LICENSING SYSTEM WITH OUR REGISTRATION SYSTEM WITH OUR INVESTIGATION SYSTEM ALL OF WHICH WERE SORT OF BUILT INDEPENDENTLY OF EACH OTHER SO BY HAVING AN ENTERPRISE CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT SITS ON TOP OF THOSE AND ALLOWS US NOW TO LOOK AT THAT AS ONE BIG PIECE OF DATA SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO PHYSICALLY GO OR HAVE A SEPARATE LOG INTO CREDENTIALS. AND FOR EACH SYSTEM YOU NEED TO YOU NEED TO ACCESS IN SOME CASES LIKE OUR INVESTIGATORS THEY NEED TO ACCESS ALL OF THE SISTERS FROM THEIR DOING INVESTIGATIONS ARE COMMON LICENSEE POLICY I NEED TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN DRIVER SAFETY WHICH TODAY REQUIRES A SEPARATE SET OF CREDENTIALS A SEPARATE SET OF SERVERS THAT ARE NOT ALWAYS THAT WAY COULD BE IN A DATA CENTER AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEKING TO SOLVE BY USING MODERN TECHNOLOGY THAT SPANS ALL THESE INDEPENDENT. SILOS WITHIN THE DMB. DO SEE USES FOR IT B. R. DMV'S. CURRY SCOPE OF DAY. BUT THAT WOULD BE BETTER IF TO THE STATE. WHY I THINK THESE TYPES OF SYSTEMS ARE FAIRLY COMMON IN THE TECHNOLOGY SPACE I'M SURE OTHER DEPARTMENTS ARE DOING SOMETHING SIMILAR WE'RE JUST TRYING TO GET OUR TEAMS TO STOP BUILDING THE OTHERS VERTICAL DISCONNECTED SILOS AND START LOOKING AT THE BUSINESS MORE HORIZONTALLY. SO I SUSPECT OTHER DEPARTMENTS ARE DOING SOMETHING VERY VERY SIMILAR BUT I CAN'T I CAN'T SPEAK TO OTHERS IT IS ASKING THE GENERAL CONTEXT OF A LOT OF WHAT WE- PURSUE AS LEGISLATORS OR THOUGHT OFTENTIMES EDUCATION INFORMATIONAL PROGRAMS ARE TRYING TO GO OUT TO FOLKS YOU KNOW ON A MASS BASIS- AND- IN A JUST ONE OF THE SYSTEM- BY CONSULTING THE DATA LIKE THIS WOULD. WOULD WOULD CREATE THE ABILITY. TO- YOU KNOW TO ESSENTIALLY. INTERNALLY WITH THE N. B. TO DO THAT KIND OF THING- NOTIFICATIONS TO PEOPLE- YOU KNOW WHAT. YEAH HE TO A BOOK ABOUT- NOT NECESSARILY RELATED SERVICES BUT STATE SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE. THE EIGHT STRIKES ME THAT THE SYSTEM WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE SAID AND WHAT'S IN THE REPORT IN JUST MY GENERAL UNDERSTANDING OF MAKING A FEW DIEM BEACON CORY'S RECENTLY THAT. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW VEHICLE REGISTRATION HERE IN ONE PLACE IF YOU WANT TO KNOW- SOMETHING ELSE IT'LL LOOK IT SEEMS TO BE A COMPLETE ALMOST A SEPARATE DATABASES WHAT I'M HEARING YOU SAY OF VERTICAL SILOS- YOU DON'T YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO THAT FAR AND ANSWER THE QUESTION IF IT'S NOT COME UP I GUESS I SHOULD PURPOSES QUESTIONS. THE QUESTIONS LIKE THAT WITH- THE PHRASE HAS THAT COME UP. I THINK THAT'S ALWAYS REALLY LOOKING FOR YES THERE ARE SOME DATA SHARING- INITIATIVES I CAN'T THINK OF A SPECIFIC NAME BUT I THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS DRIVING SOME DATA SHARING INITIATIVES SO THAT DEPARTMENTS LIKE FOR EXAMPLE WE SHARE DATA USING A TECHNOLOGY CALLED SNOWFLAKE. WITH EUROPE AUTOMOTIVE REPAIRS BECAUSE WE HAVE A SHARED INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE VEHICLES ARE BEING SMOG MAKING SURE SMOG I TESTER NOT BEING BY PASSING BY HAVING THOSE DATA SHARING AGREEMENTS THAT ALLOWS US TO WORK MUCH MORE COLLABORATIVELY AND WE DO WE SHARE SOME OF OUR INFORMATION THAT'S SPECIFIC TO THEIR BUSINESS THEY SHARE SOME OTHERS. SO WE CAN BETTER EFFECTUATE OUR GOALS SO WE ARE DOING YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING SENATOR IT'S NOT ACROSS ALL FACETS OF GOVERNMENT BENEFITS ACROSS ADJACENT BUSINESS GREAT THAT'S HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND FOR FUTURE REFERENCE THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU- THERE WAS A QUESTION THAT'S BEEN A SUGGESTED THAT WHAT ARE. THE OUT YOUR COST OF THE SYSTEM. SO THE ITEM IF YOU HAVE THE IDEA BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE THOSE OF THE PROPOSAL. YEP THAT'S SO. SO JUST TO BE KIND OF OUR ONLY ASKING- TO FOR THE NEXT YEARS REQUEST A DOLLARS AND THAT WILL BE COMING FORWARD. WITH A FUTURE PROPOSAL. WE WANT TO TRY TO GET THROUGH THE POWER PROCESS FIRST AND ONCE WE COMPLETE STAGE FOUR WILL KNOW HOW MUCH THE OUT YEARS OF COSTS ARE GOING TO BE I THINK. WE HAVE SOME ESTIMATES IN MY BED TO BE CLEAR AND WE WERE WORKING WITH A CONSULTANT AT FIRST THAT. I WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE WITH THIS PROPOSAL FIRST PICTURE OF WENT THROUGH CALL AND THEN WE WILL BE COMING BACK PROBABLY- EITHER IN THE TEXTURES GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OR IN EXTREME. CHECK THE MONITOR THERE IS A JUST A WONDER IS NOT NOT AND I'M GOING TO. BUT AWAY. OKAY IF I COULD JUMP INTO. IT MY UNDERSTANDING HERE BASED ON THE ANALYSIS AT THE FIVE EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS YEAR IS TO ADDRESS. USER MAKE A LEGACY SYSTEM CONTINUE WORKING BUT THE LONG TERM GOAL IS TO FULLY REPLACES LEGACY SYSTEMS. IN WHICH CASE I ASSUME IT'S A MUCH LARGER COSTS IS THAT A FAIR ASSUMPTION. MANY ME TRY TO TAKE THAT UNTIL WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF MODERNISATIONS ARE TRYING TO DO TWO DIFFERENT THINGS ONESELF. ONE IS MAKE SURE THAT THOSE LEGACY SYSTEMS THAT I SPOKE WITH THE SILOS AS I REFERRED TO THEM. YOU CAN'T COMMUNICATE AND WE CAN DO OUR JOB ACROSS ASSISTANCE. OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS WE HAVE- BUDGET FROM FROM YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DOUBT THAT ARE HELPING US MODERNIZE AS WE MODERNIZE WE'RE GOING TO BE. CONSOLIDATED SOME ASSISTANCE IN THAT'S ALREADY COVERED IN A DISH AND ADDITION OF BUDGET. SO THAT'S NOT THE MODERN AGE ISN'T GONNA SOLVE EVERY SILO BUT IT'S GOING TO CONSOLIDATE A NUMBER OF THEM. WHICH WILL SERVE OBVIATE THE NEED FOR THIS FEDERATED. FEDERATED STRATEGY. YOU KNOW. GOING INTO THE FUTURE BUT IT WE'RE STILL GETTING THE REST OF IT HAVE SOME FEDERATED SILOS THAT ARE GOING TO STILL BE. ISOLATED UNITS THAT ARE NOT PART OF OUR MAIN MODERNIZATION STRATEGY WHICH IS VERY VERY FOCUSED ON VEHICLE REGISTRATION. DRIVER'S LICENSE IN AN OCCUPATIONAL LICENSE BUT AS YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE DMV HAS MANY OTHER FACETS OF THE BUSINESS. THAT ARE NOT PART OF THAT MAINLINE MODERNISATIONS ARE STILL GONNA NEED THIS TECHNOLOGY TO HELP US SCHEDULE OF THAT BECAUSE- THE TEARS MAKING OF. REYES I THINK THAT MAYBE GOT A MISTER GORDON THANK YOU I THINK YOU HAVE TO HAVE A COPY BUSINESS BUT I THINK THAT THE GENERAL YOU HAVE BUDGET FOR THE LARGER KIND OF MODERNIZATION PROCESS THIS BUDGET IS TO ADDRESS EGIN ACCOUNT OF THE MAKING SURE THAT THE SILENT LEGACY OPERATION CONTINUES TO. WORK APPERLEY FOR THE TIME BEING IS THAT CORRECT. YES NOT MAKE SENSE TO ME. AND THE I'M SORRY THE- THE BIGGER MODERNIZATION. WHAT IS THE ESTIMATED TIME FRAME FOR THAT. MONTEROSSO WE'VE COMPLETED OUR FIRST PHASE OF OUR FIRST RELEASE OF OUR FIRST PHASE IT'S A IT'S A MULTI YEAR JOURNEY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR YEARS YEAH YOU ARE ON THE TIME I TIME I BUT WE ARE HALFWAY THROUGH WITH OUR FIRST PHASE RIGHT NOW. AFTER OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING WHERE IN THE CONTRACTING PHASE FOR A VEHICLE REGISTRATION WHICH IS OUR LARGEST UP THE CARAVAN AND THEY WERE JUST STARTING NOW THE BUILDING OF THE PAL DOCUMENTS WE JUST TALK ABOUT FOR THE DRIVER'S LICENSE. SO IT'S PROBABLY GONNA BE THREE YEARS THREE TO FOUR YEAR TIME HORIZON HOBBY EXACTLY IN FRONT OF ME BY DEATH BUT AT THAT POINT IN TIME WE WILL THEN HAVE BE ABLE TO TURN OFF TO ME VERY VERY LEGACY SYSTEM SOME THAT WERE YOU ARCHITECT IN THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES AND YOU'RE NOT GOING WHAT THEY'RE STILL WORKING TODAY BUT OBVIOUSLY IT'S A- GOOD FOR US. TO BE ABLE TO RETIRE THE SYSTEM TO BE ON A MODERATE PLATFORM TO NOT ONLY EXTEND OUR SYSTEMS TO REACH CALIFORNIANS IT ALSO REDUCED RISK OF SOME OF THOSE LEGACY SYSTEMS. OF FAILING TO START UP IN THE MORNING. OKAY GOD IT. ANYMORE COMMENTS QUESTIONS NONE OKAY GREAT OKAY- THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MR GORDON AND MR SCOTT- WE DONE WITH THAT ISSUE. AND WE'RE NOW GOING TO MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENTS AND SOLAR DISCUSSION ITEMS WELL WE'RE DONE WITH THEM WE WANT THE PUBLIC COMMENT AND THEN WE WILL TAKE UP VOTING ON THE ON THE- I'D WAS FOR VOTING.
