WILL START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND. WITH HOLD ON TAKING ROLE FOR FOR A BIT OF COURSE TODAY IS THE. HEARING FOCUSED SOLELY ON THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM BEYOND. THEY. TWENTY TWENTY THREE CAPTURE SYSTEM RIGHT NEARLY THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND. A FULL TIME. EQUIVALENT CALIFORNIANS THAT PARTICIPATE IN UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT AND THEN CERTAINLY A MANY OF US HAVE A STRONG FEELINGS TO OUR CSU RATHER. WE HAVE WHEN OUR DISTRICT JURY OR YOU WENT TO A CSU SO THAT'S CERTAINLY HOW MY CASE. YOU KNOW THE. THE CSU SYSTEM YOU KNOW HAD ITS UPS AND DOWNS DURING THE GREAT RECESSION BUT YOU KNOW POLICE TO. PLEASED TO REPORT THAT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE SOME SIGNIFICANT THREE INVESTMENTS IN THEM CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM HELPING STABILIZE FUNDING. AND THAT PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND ACCESS BUT WE KNOW THAT'S. NOT NEARLY ENOUGH WE HAVE CERTAINLY A LONG WAYS TO GO WILL BE HEARING ABOUT. THAT DURING TODAY'S AYE TODAY'S HEARING. WE ALSO WANT TO FOCUS ON ON SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE KNOW EXISTS I KNOW EVEN WITH. OUR STABLE FUNDING THE PAST FEW YEARS WE WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO. ACCOMMODATE EVERY CALIFORNIAN WHO'S ELIGIBLE APPLIES THIS YEAR'S YOU WE ESTIMATE IS ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND. QUALIFIED STUDENTS ARE TURNED AWAY EACH YEAR AND THAT CRISIS OF ACCESS IS SOMETHING THAT CONCERNS US WORKING TO. AYE RESOLVE WE ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THEIR GRADUATION INITIATIVE. I KNOW WE HAVE GOT CAMPUS PRESENT HERE TO TALK ABOUT THEIR EFFORTS HERE IN IN SACRAMENTO. IT CERTAINLY ADDRESSING THIS WOULD HELP STUDENTS GRADUATE IN THEM. MORE UPRIGHT PROMPTED A TIME PERIOD THE LESSENING THE BURDENS ON DEBT INSTANT LOANS AND SO FORTH BUT ALSO. FREEING UP SPACE RATHER CALIFORNIANS TO HELP US ACCOMMODATE THOSE THIRTY THOUSAND WHO DON'T HAVE. AN OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND THE S. CSU SYSTEM AYE WE KNOW THAT THE JANUARY BUDGET. WE'RE GONNA HEAR IS. WAS A. WAS NOT QUITE WHAT THE CSU SYSTEM AND THE TRUSTEES ASK FOR IN THEIR REQUEST AND SO WE WANT TO HEAR MORE. ABOUT THAT WHAT ENTAILS ALSO WANT TO FOCUS ON WHAT. ELEMENTS ARE THERE IN THAT REQUESTS AND I KNOW IT'S A HUNDRED. AND SEVENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS ABOVE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. SOMEONE OF CONCERN OF THIS A SUBCOMMITTEE IS THAT. SUCH A LIMITED AMOUNT GOES TO ACCESS AND. FULFILLING ENROLLMENT GROWTH FOR CALIFORNIANS BECAUSE WE GO HOME TO OUR DISTRICTS. OUR CONSTITUENTS ASK US ABOUT ACCESS NOT CORPS NEEDS NOT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NOT COMPENSATION. THAT THE OTHERS THOSE ARE ALL IMPORTANT ISSUES BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE CERTAINLY HERE. FROM OUR HOME IN OUR DISTRICTS SO THAT'S KIND OF A. SNAPSHOT OF OVER LOOKING AT TALKING ABOUT TODAY SO THAT. NOW LET'S GET GOING AND BRING UP CSU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE LA O. TO GO OVER THAT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY BUDGET. SO ISSUE NUMBER ONE IS THE GOVERNOR'S. PROPOSED. BUDGET AS WELL AS THE CSU FUNDING REQUEST WILL START OFF DEPARTMENT FINANCE. THEN WE'LL GO TO THE LA GO AND THEN WE'LL HEAR FROM. CSU CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. DAN HAD OR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THIS CSU SERVES OVER FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS ACROSS TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES. AT THE CSU RECEIVESFUNDING FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES INCLUDING STATE GENERAL FUND FEDERAL FUNDS STATE LOTTERY FUND. AND STUDENT TUITION AND FEES. FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES NINETY YEAH A BUDGET INCREASE OF NINETY TWO POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS. IN ONGOING GENERAL FUND SUPPORT. THIS IS COMMENSURATE WITH WHAT THE UC FOUR RECEIVER AS IN KEEPING WITH PAST PRACTICE. THIS WILL PROVIDE THE CSU WITH. JUST OVER THREE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AND GENERAL FUND SUPPORT FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. WELL THE CSU IS THE AUTONOMY TO USE THESE FUNDS AS THEY BEST SEE FIT. THE ADMINISTRATION HOPES AT THESE FUNDS WILL GO TOWARDS FURTHERING THE EFFORTS OF THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE. ADDITIONALLY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES THIRTY NINE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS AND ONGOING SUPPORT. FOR RETIREMENT RATE ADJUSTMENT. AND WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTION. ALEJO'S. THANK YOU CHAIR MCCARTY PAUL STEINHAUSEN WITH THE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AS YOU JUST HEARD THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES A NINETY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. DOLLAR UNRESTRICTED GENERAL FUND PACING CREASED FOR CS YOU WHICH IS THE SAME DOLLAR AMOUNT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES FOR UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. AS YOU'LL HEAR THAT MUCH MORE NOW WHEN. CAL STATE UNIVERSITY A PRESENTS US YES YOU WOULD LIKE MUCH MORE THAN THAT A CS USE ASKING FOR A TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE MILLION DOLLAR. INCREASING GENERAL FUND SUPPORT AND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS MORE WHEN INCLUDING SOME OTHER RESOURCES. SO CSU IS ASKING FOR CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING. AND THE TABLE ON PAGE FOUR OF YOUR AGENDA SUMMARIZES CS USE FUNDING REQUEST. AS WITH ANY OTHER YEAR THE LEGISLATURE FACES TWO FUNDAMENTAL DECISIONS WITH CS USE BUDGET. FIRST WHICH COST INCREASES SUPPORT. AND THEN AFTER CALCULATING THE PRICE TAG FOR THOSE ACOSTA INCREASES YOU WANT TO SUPPORT DECIDE. HOW? THOSE COSTS WILL BE SHARED BETWEEN THE STATE. AND STUDENTS. YOU COULD. I HAVE THE STATE THE GENERAL FUND BEAR THE FULL FACT OF THESE COST INCREASES OR ALTERNATIVELY YOU COULD HAVE NON FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. A A PAY A SHARE OF THE COST I SAY NON FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS BECAUSE OF COURSE FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS GET. A TUITION COVERAGE. THE GENDER DOES A NICE JOB IDENTIFYING SOME OF THE MAJOR COST PRESSURES THAT YOU MAY CHOOSE TO FIND AND. CHAIR MCCARTY YOU MENTIONED ACCESS. AND ENROLLMENT GROWTH AND HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS TO STUDENTS AND THE STATE WITNESS THIS BODY. WHAT THE? WHAT CSU IS PROPOSING FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH IS RELATIVELY SMALL COMPARED TO THE OVERALL SYSTEM WIDE REQUESTED TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS BUT? FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE IT'S. PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT ARE COST COMPONENT FOR YOU TO CONSIDER. IN RECENT YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAS PROVIDED FUNDING SPECIFICALLY FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH. AND THE CSU HAS A NUMBER OF ENROLLMENT PRESSURES AND CONSIDERATIONS IN THE BUDGET YEAR RELATED TO ENROLLMENT GROWTH. ONE ONE CONSIDERATION. IS THAT THE NUMBER OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES IN THE STATE. IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE BY ABOUT ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT THIS YEAR INSP IN THE SPRING. WHICH ALL OTHER THINGS BEING EQUAL WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE OF DEMAND OF ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT. FOR FALL FOR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ARE IN ENROLLMENT YOU HAVE THE STUDENTS. COMING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL OF WANTING A SLOT AT NOT CAL STATE UNIVERSITY. JERRY MCCARTY ALSO MENTION THE ISSUE OF STUDENTS THAT HAVE APPLIED TO CSU AND HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE uGET BE THE ONLY ONE. APPLY TO ONE PROGRAM THAT ONE CAN'T THIS OR MAYBE THEY APPLY TO MULTIPLE CAMPUSES BUT THERE'S ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND STUDENTS EACH YEAR. THAT ARE NOT ABLE TO GET INTO ANY PROGRAM THAT CSU THEY APPLY TO WIN AND THAT'S SOMETHING YOU'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT. LATER IN THE AGENDA. AND UNDERLYING ISSUE AN ISSUE THAT UNDERLIES THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION ABOUT ENROLLMENT AT CS YOU IS THE FACT THAT CSU IS DRAWING FROM WELL BEYOND ITS MASTER PLAN. TARGET LEVEL. AND SPECIFICALLY WHAT THAT MEANS IS IN THE SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN CSU LEARNED THAT ITS ADMISSIONS POLICIES ARE IDENTIFYING THE TOP FORTY ONE PERCENT. OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES AS ELIGIBLE TO ATTEND CSU IS FRESHMAN THE TOP FORTY ONE PERCENT RATHER THAN THE TOP THIRTY THREE PERCENT WHICH IS BEEN THE STATE'S HISTORIC PRACTICE. SO. THIS MEANS THAT CSU IS DEEMING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AS ELIGIBLE FOR FRESH IN IT FRESHMAN ADMISSION WHEN HISTORICALLY. THE STUDENTS WOULD HAVE BEEN. AYE DIVERTED TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES FIRST TO COMPLETE THEIR FRESHMAN AND SOPHOMORE YEARS AND THEN HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO TRANSFER TO CSU ACTUALLY GUARANTEED TO TRANSFER TO SEE IF YOU IF THEY GET A CERTAIN GPA.% SO THIS ISSUE ABOUT CSU FINDING IT'S DRYING FROM BEYOND ITS MASTER PLAN TARGET LEVEL. IS REALLY CREATED A LOT OF EN ROUTE ROMAN PRESSURE ON THE SYSTEM AND GOING FORWARD THE LEGISLATURE HAS A DECISION TO MAKE ON. WHETHER CSU SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO CONTINUE DRAWING FROM THIS LARGER POOL OF STUDENTS. OR WHETHER OUR CS YOU SHOULD BE ARE COUNSELED TO TIGHTEN ITS ADMISSION. CRITERIA SO THAT IT GETS BACK DOWN TO. MAYBE THIRTY THREE PERCENT OR WHATEVER LEVEL YOU TEAM IS. IS IS NEEDED IS IS PREFERABLE IS COST EFFECTIVE FOR THE STATE AND THE SYSTEM. HADN'T NOW ADOPTING STRICTER ADMISSIONS REQUIREMENTS WOULD REDUCE THOSE ENROLLMENT PRESSURES ON CSU IN THE OUT. YEARS AND FREE UP GENERAL FUND FOR OTHER COST OF. PURPOSES OTHER UP PRIORITIES ON THE OTHER HAND IT WOULD MEAN THAT OTHER THAT MORE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. ARE COMING OUT NO GRADUATING THEIR SENIOR YEAR WITH A THREE POINT NO OR HIGHER. MIGHT FIND THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO TO THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES FIRST AND SO THAT COULD LEAD TO SOME. DISAPPOINTMENT OR FRUSTRATION ON THEIR PART MAY NOT BE THEIR FIRST. CHOICE SO YOU JUST HAVE TO WEIGH THOSE KINDS OF TRADE OFFS. YEAH SO REALLY IN SOME ON THIS ENROLLMENT ISSUE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT UNDERLYING DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES THAT ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT INCREASE I MENTIONED EARLIER. INCREASE IN HIGH SCHOOL GRADS THIS YEAR I TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THIS ISSUE OF IMPACTION. AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE STATE POLICY ON WHICH STUDENTS COMING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL ARE ELIGIBLE TO ENROLL DIRECTLY AT CSU. SO AND THEN ISSUE TO THIS AGENDA IS GONNA GO THROUGH SOME OF THE OTHER MAJOR ISSUES ISSUE TOO COURSES GONNA TALK ABOUT THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE WHICH IS ANOTHER AND A. BIG TICKET ITEM AND AND PRIORITY OF THE CSU. MR STARR. I THINK YOU A CHAIR MCCARTY MUNNINGS RAINSTORM ON THE ASSISTANT VICE CHANCELLOR FOR BUDGET GOOD TO SEE YOU ALL AGAIN. MY COMMENTS WILL BE VERY SIMILAR TO THAT OVERVIEW HEARING BACK IN FEBRUARY. BECAUSE THE C. ISSUES ESSENTIAL. OF FUN PER PRIORITIES HAVE NOT CHANGED SINCE THEN. IT WILL DO IS I LIKE TO START WITH AN ASSERTION ON I HOPE YOU HOPE YOU AGREE WITH THIS I THINK. MOST OF YOU HAVE HEARD MANY OF YOUR COMMENTS AND YOUR. AND YOUR PREFERENCES OVER THE YEARS AND I LIKE TO MAKE THIS ASSERTION TO SEE ISSUE AND YOU ASSURE THE SAME FUNDING PRIORITIES. THEY ARE IMPROVING GRADUATION RATES. THERE INCREASING STUDENT ACCESS. AND THEY ARE FAIRLY COMPENSATING OUR EMPLOYEES. SO THESE PARTIES HAVE BEEN IN CURRENTLY ARE IN OUR WILL AND WILL BE OUR SHARE PARTY'S GOING FORWARD. YOU KNOW REVISIT THESE PARTIES. THROUGHOUT MY COMMENTS. SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK FIRST AT HOW THESE PARTIES HAVE SOME HAVE BEEN SUPPORT IN THE RECENT PAST. IF YOU TAKE A STAND OUT HERE. HAD THE SURGEON HAD THAT OUT YOU TURN TO PAGE TWO. LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU AGAIN THE MANY CSU SUCCESSES SINCE THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY BEGAN. CHAIR MCCARTY MENTION THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF GOOD INVESTMENT THE C. ISSUE. SINCE THE AVERAGE RECOVERY AND WE'RE APPRECIATIVE OF IT FOR SURE. AND IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE ALL THE SUCCESSES THAT YOU SEE ON THIS LIST HERE TODAY WITHOUT. YOUR REGULAR INVESTMENT AS WELL AS THE SENATE AND THE GOVERNOR. SO YOUR PARTNERSHIP OVER IT. WITH THIS ISSUE OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS HAS RESULTED IN IN THESE ACHIEVEMENTS HERE AND A HIGH LIKE THREE OF THEM WE COULD SEE THEM HERE CHECKED IN BLUE. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ENROLL A THIRTY ONE THOUSAND MORE A FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS THAT'S ABOUT THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND HEAD COUNT FUNDED HEAD COUNT. WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO CREATING TWO NEW CAMPUSES. AT ESSENTIALLY ONE THE SIZE OF CSU SAN BERNADINE ON THE OTHER THE SIZE OF CHICO STATE. CAMPUSES OF HAVE ALSO ADDED AN ESTIMATED FIFTEEN THOUSAND NEW COURSE SECTIONS. TO THEIR OFFERINGS. THIRTY TWO HUNDRED MORE. IN JUST THE LAST YEAR ALONE USING THE GRADUATION ISSUED A FUNDING. AND WE'VE CONSISTENTLY A CIVIL EMPLOYEE CONTRACTS OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. SO THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH ROOM BRIEFLY AT THE C. ISSUE NOW LET'S TURN TO TODAY. SO ORDER PROVIDE SOME HIGH LEVEL CONTEXT. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE. THE SHOWS THE MAIN REVENUE SOURCES FOR THE CSU OPERATING BUDGET. AND. ABOUT HALF OF THE A HALF OF THAT FUNDING IS FROM THE STATE GENERAL FUND. AND THE OTHER HALF IS FROM TUITION AND FEES. AND THIS EXCLUDES THOSE REVENUE SOURCES LIKE HOUSING. PARKING A CONTINUING EDUCATION AND OTHER ENTERPRISE WILL BE CALL ENTERPRISE ACTIVITIES SO THOSE THINGS ARE CAN A WRAPAROUND ACTIVITIES AND AND SERVICES THAT STUDENTS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ON TALKING UP HERE ON THIS PARTICULAR SLIDE JUST ABOUT OUR OP. BUDGET. WHAT IS WHAT YOU SIMMERS SIMILARLY SEE ON THE UC SIDE TO CALL THEIR CORE BUDGET THIS IS KIND OF AN APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON TO THAT? BUT PAGE FOUR SHOWS THE MAIN CATEGORIES OF EXPENSES FOR THE OPERATING BUDGET. SO AS YOU CAN SEE THE SEIZURES PREDOMINATELY A PEOPLE POWERED UNIVERSITY. ABOUT SEVENTY PERCENT OF OUR EXPENSES ARE FOR THE SALARIES AND WAGES OF OUR APPROXIMATELY FIFTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. ADDITIONALLY WORTH NOTING IS THAT INSTITUTIONAL FINANCIAL AID WHAT WE CALL THE STATE UNIVERSITY GRANT. TOTALS ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ASSIST ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS WITH THEIR TUITION COSTS. I STILL FOCUSING ON TODAY AT PAGE FIVE IS WHERE WILL CAMP OUT FOR IT A LITTLE BIT. IN THIS HANDOUT SERVES A A COUPLE PURPOSES. ONE OF THOSE PURPOSES IS TO TO. DIPPED DEPICT OUR SHARED PARTIES TODAY. AS REFLECTED IN THE C. ISSUES REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THE RIGHT COLUMN THAT YOU SEE IS THE TRUSTEES REQUEST INCREASE OF TWO HUNDRED SIXTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S THE AMOUNT THAT. I MISTER STEVE HAS MENTIONED EARLIER. THAT'S DEFINED ONLY WHAT WE WOULD SAY ARE MOST ESSENTIAL ITEMS. WHICH INCLUDE GRADUATION INITIATIVE FAIR COMPENSATION ENROLLMENT GROWTH. FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS AS WELL AS A MANDATORY COST LIKE HEALTH AND RETIREMENT COST INCREASES. SO WE'VE AND WE HAVE A GREAT MOMENTUM IN OUR TRIP IN OUR AND ARE ON TRACK TO MAKE S. HISTORIC PROGRESS ON DOUBLING OUR FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATES. THROUGH THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE TO HEAR A LOT ABOUT THAT IN THE NEXT PANEL. BUT WE WILL NEED ONGOING AND CONSISTENT. IN ENHANCE FUNDING TO REALIZE GOALS OVER. THE NEXT STEP FIVE YEARS INCLUDING OF EIGHTEEN NINETEEN YEAR. IN THIS THOUSANDS MORE STUDENTS MEET MINIMUM CSU ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS AND COMPLETE THEIR ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER DEGREES AT THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES. WE NEED RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN OFFER THEM A SEAT AT THE CSU. AND YOU'LL BE DEALING WITH A LOT ALL IS ENROLLMENT DISCUSSIONS AND TOPICS OF LATER THAT MISTER STEVE HOUSE AND ALSO MENTIONED SO. YOU HAVE THAT LATER ON YOUR AGENDA AS WELL. ALSO AFTER YEARS OF STAGNANT WAGES I DO THE STATE'S FISCAL CONDITION DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. OUR FACULTY AND STAFF ARE RECEIVING WELL DESERVED RAISES. ON AVERAGE ABOUT THREE PERCENT PER YEAR. COMPARABLE TO THOSE RECEIVED BY STATE EMPLOYEES. AND INFRASTRUCTURE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE HEALTH CARE AND PENSION COST INCREASES REQUIRE CONSTANT FISCAL ATTENTION EACH AND EVERY YEAR. I KNOW THE OTHER PURPOSE OF THIS PAGE IS TO BEGIN TO ANSWER THAT COMMONLY ASKED QUESTION NAMELY WHAT ARE SEE ISSUES THOUGHTS ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL. SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL INCLUDES AS YOU HEARD FROM. MISTER HAN OUR AYE NINETY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. THAT PROVIDES A ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT INCREASE TO OUR TOTAL OPERATING BUDGET. THOSE TO PIE CHARTS THAT I SHOWED YOU EARLIER. THAT FALLS HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILLION SHORT OF OUR OF FUNDING REQUEST. NO THE LEFT COLUMN SHOWS HOW FAR WE CAN STRETCH THAT NINETY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR. WHEN MEASURED AGAINST THE IN THAT THE UNIVERSE IS ENTIRE OPREME BUDGET THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED INCREASE PROVIDES LESS THAN HALF THE RATE OF INFLATION. AND THE SIXTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS. IT'S SIXTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS SHORT OF WHAT WE NEED SIMPLY TO COVER OUR EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION BECAUSE. AND ARE MANDATORY COST INCREASES. YOU CAN SEE THE SIXTY ONE MILLION AT DEPICTED HERE IN THOSE HASH REDLINES. SO WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR IT WILL BE A TOUGH BUDGET YEAR FOR US FRANKLY. IN CAMPUS PRESENCE WILL HAVE TO MAKE DIFFICULT DECISIONS TO COVER FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS RESULTING IN DECREASES A CAMPUS OPERATIONS INCLUDING ACADEMIC. PROGRAMS AND ACADEMIC SUPPORTS. ALSO. THE TRUSTEES WILL HAVE TO CONSIDER WHETHER TO AUTHORIZE A TUITION INCREASE TO MEET VERY BASIC FINANCIAL NEEDS OF OUR CAMPUSES. AND TO BE MORE PRECISE A TUITION INCREASES AN OPTION OF LAST RESORT FOR THE C. ISSUE. MOST IMPORTANTLY THE NAY THAT POSSIBLE ARE THE POTENTIAL NEGATIVE IT BUDGETS ARE TODAY WE WOULD NOT A SET US UP. NOW AND SET US UP NOR STUDENTS ARE THE STATE'S ECONOMY FOR A STELLAR A TOMORROW. WITH NEARLY A HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS EARNING BACCALAUREATE DEGREES IN THE CSU EVERY YEAR AT A TIME WHEN THE STATE HAS A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS. I I KNOW WHETHER I INVESTMENT HAS THE SAME POTENTIAL TO POSITIVELY IMPACT THE FUTURE OF THE STATE. SO I THINK PAGE SIX SUMS IT UP. I TO SEE ISSUE IN THE STATE ENSURE. COMMENT PARTIES TODAY. THAT WILL SHAPE TOMORROW. SO CAN FIT CONSISTENT INVESTMENT IN COMPLETION THROUGH THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE CONSISTS INVESTMENT IN IN ENROLLMENT AND NEW ACCESS. AND CONSISTENT INVESTMENT AND MOMENTUM THROUGH OUR REGULAR COMPENSATION INCREASES AND OTHER NECESSITIES. THOSE THREE PARTIES WILL HELP MEET CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE WORKFORCE NEEDS. SO WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE GOOD PROGRESS SO FAR AND WE HOPE TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE THE GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION CONTINUE THE MOMENTUM OVER THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS. AND WE THIS YEAR'S YOU CAN. THAT CAN ONLY ACCOMPLISH THESE PARTIES WITH YOUR FINANCIAL PARTNERSHIP. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST FOR FUNDING OF THIS ISSUES BUDGET REQUEST. BY INVESTING ADDITIONAL HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS ABOVE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. THANK YOU IN ARE OPEN TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU WE WILL HAVE THAT SERIES OF QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS HERE BUT LET'S TAKE ROLE WILL. MCCARTY HERE. CHáVEZ HERE. MEDINA HERE. MURATSUCHI. CORMAN'S ESTABLISHED. THANK YOU WILL START WITH THE MR MEDINA. I THINK WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE THIRTY THOUSAND STUDENTS THAT THAT CSU TURNS AWAY. YOU MENTIONED A INCREASE OF DEMAND IN THE NEXT YEAR OF ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT STUDENT DEMAND. FRUIT SEE ISSUE CAN YOU TRANSLATE THAT INTO NUMBERS. FOR ME. ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT WOULD BE ABOUT. EIGHT THOUSAND STUDENTS. WHAT A SIX? YEAR TERMS IT REACTS OR STUDENTS ANSWERS ACTUAL STUDENTS WRITE ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND BUT IT DOES DOES IT OF THIS. OKAY. JEFF JARVIS. I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS DISCUSSION SO I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE. ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES WE WE HEAR ABOUT IN CALIFORNIA. A LOT WHICH WHICH NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AS A WHOLE ISSUES SOCIAL EQUITY. AND THE ABILITY TO. OBTAIN THAT. ESPECIALLY IN A CHALLENGING COMMUNITIES ENSURE THAT. YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE A GOOD EDUCATION BECAUSE BECAUSE WE KNOW THE GOOD EDUCATION THEN THEY GET THE JOB TO GO FORWARD. AND WE KNOW THAT. THE A CHANGING SOCIETY THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. PEOPLE NEED MORE SKILLS TO BE COMPETITIVE INTERNATIONALLY. SO. I'M GONNA GO THROUGH SOME THE COMMENT YOU MADE. AND. AND THEN TYING TO I THINK WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS GO. THE HIGH SCHOOL HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATE INCLUDES ANA IMPROVING THE ONE POINT EIGHT. DOES I'M LIKE A BIG NUMBER TO ME. FROM THE GOVERNOR'S STANDPOINT IS THAT AN APPROPRIATE NUMBER IS A GOOD NUMBER. SHOULD WE BE DOING BETTER. THE ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT INCREASE DEMAND NOT GRADUATION LABELS I SCHOOL GRADUATIONS APPROVED BY ONE POINT EIGHT IS THAT A GOOD NUMBER BAD NUMBER SHOULD BE HIGHER LOWER. CHRIS FORGET SOME OF FINANCE. I THINK I'D HAVE TO DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUES THAT COVER THAT THE CAPABLE SECTION OF OUR BUDGET BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY WORK WITH YOUR STAFF TO. ARMED RESPONSE YOUR QUESTION AFTER HE SAID THAT BUT WHAT I WANT WHEN I'M TRYING TO HIGHLIGHT THE POINT IS THAT. WE HAVE A PROBLEM CALIFORNIA WITH CASEY TWELVE GRADUATION RATE. AND THAT IN BILLS LOT OF DISCUSSION ON CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION WAS STUDENTS WHICH I'M A BIG SUPPORTER OF. BUT IS ALSO A. BIG REQUIREMENT FOR CHILDREN FOR YOUNG PEOPLE GOING TO COLLEGE BE COLLEGE READY. NOW WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT. THE ALLEY ó TALKED ABOUT THE MASTER PLAN BEING AT THIRTY THREE PERCENT OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE WOULD BE GOING OFF TO. COLLEGE WERE AT FORTY ONE PERCENT. FROM A LA O. PERSPECTIVE LOOKING AT THE ECONOMY HAS. OF CALIFORNIA WHERE WE'RE GOING TO GROW OUR WORKFORCE. IS FORTY ONE PERCENT TO GOOD NUMBER. FORGETTING ABOUT THE ISSUE OF THE MASTER PLAN BEING AT THIRTY THREE PERCENT. IS FORTY ONE PERCENT THE RIGHT NUMBER FOR OUR SOCIETY TO GO FORWARD SHOULD BE FORTY FIVE FIFTY OR SHOULD ITBE TWENTY FIVE. I MEAN WHAT WHAT IS THE GROWTH. THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT. FROM MINNELLI O. PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT. TO LAND ON BUT COUPLE THINGS WE DO. A. LIKE TO TO THINK ABOUT AND AND SHARE. FIRST IT'S IMPORTANT TO JUST. ARE. ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE WHETHER IT'S THIRTY THREE PERCENT OR FORTY ONE PERCENT OF THE OF THE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES. GOING TO YEAH ELIGIBLE TO ATTEND CSU THAT'S JUST AS FRESHMEN THAT THAT. THE MASTER PLAN. TALKED ABOUT UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. THROUGH ONE OF TWO ROUTES. THAT PREFERENCE IN THE MASTER PLAN IS FOR THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS. FIRST ATTEND COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND THEN TRANSFER TO CAL STATE UNIVERSITY YOUR YOU SEE. OR A PRIVATE YEAH AND THAT'S THAT'S A COST IS IS A LOT BEHIND THAT YOU TO KEEP COSTS DOWN KEPT A COMMITTEE COLLEGES HAVE LOWER. OPERATING COSTS THEN YOU SEE INSIDIOUS YOU YOU SEE FOCUSES ON RESEARCH CSU HAS RESEARCH AS WELL AND AND A LOT OF UPPER DIVISION STUDENTS IT'S A MORE EXPENSIVE SYSTEM. SO THE IDEA OF IN THE MASTER PLAN IS TO HAVE THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS GO TO. OUR COMMITTEE COLLEGES FIRST TO DO THEIR LOWER DIVISION COURSEWORK AND THEN GO TO UC AND CSU. YEAH IDEA THERE IS IF. IF THE STATE CAN. REDUCE COSTS AT THE LOWER DIVISION LEVEL THEY'LL BE MORE MONEY FOR THE STUDENTS WHEN THEY ARRIVE AS TRANSFER STUDENTS. SO. THE FIRST POINT IS ABOUT TRANSFER YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS IS DOESN'T MEAN THAT ONLY THIRTY THREE PERCENT OF STUDENTS ARE FORTY ONE PERSON STUDENTS HAVE A CHANCE TO GO TO. CS YOU IT JUST MEANS THEY HAVE TO GO TO A CHANCE TO GO TO CSU AS FRESHMEN AND IN FACT. IT'S ABOUT HALF I THINK GIVE CSU STUDENTS ARE. A GRADUATES OF THE CSU A BACHELORS DEGREE PROGRAM STARTED THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THE OTHER ISSUE FOR YOU TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION IS THE COST THE COST ISSUE YOU HAVE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. THAT IS. AUTOMATICALLY SPENT ON K. TWELVE INCOMMUNICADO EDGES YOU HAVE SO SPACE AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES LOT OF COMMITTEE COLLEGE DISTRICTS ARE TALKING ABOUT. THEY HAVE ON USED ENROLLMENT. CAPACITY. AND SO. AND AT SAME TIME CSU IS A MORE EXPENSIVE SYSTEM BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT IT SERVING UPPER DIVISION STUDENTS AND DOES HAVE. IN. GRADUATE STUDENTS AS WELL SO JUST TAKEN DO JUST THAT WE ENCOURAGE LEGISLATORS TO REALLY WAY THAT THAT ISSUE ABOUT COST AS WELL. A WHEN DECIDING ON AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL. LET'S GO TO THE ISSUE OF COST. YOU LOOK LIKE A DISEASE USE I MEAN TO COMEDIC ALL JUST. IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE HAD A HEARING A FEW WEEKS AGO TALKING ABOUT MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT THROUGH. THE INTERNET ONLINE TO AND WE HAD ADDS BIG PUSH BACK AGAINST. WHAT PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS TO GO IN THE COMMUNICABLE EDGES ARE GIVEN THE SKILLS? ACTUALLY TRANSFERRED TO IS CSU. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF STILL MANY COLLEGE YOU NEED COLLEGE ACTUALLY TRANSFER INDICES YOU? I'M NOT SURE I CAN GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT ARE VERY HIGH PROBABLY ABOUT IF YOU LOOK AT. STUDENTS THAT ARE. IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES AS WANTING TO TRANSFER IT'S FIFTY PERCENT ARE UNDER GETS US ABOUT A BIG DUMB AND SO MY POINT IS AND BACK IN THE DAY WHEN I WAS WENT TO COMMUNICABLE AGE. IT WAS A MUCH LARGER NUMBER. AND WOULDN'T ANOTHER INTERESTING THING WE HEARD JUST A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHEN ANOTHER SUB BUDGET DO WEARING. THAT. WHEN YOU TRANSFERRED. TWO A KIT BAG SHE ISSUE ALL YOUR CLASSES WERE NOT IMMEDIATELY ACCEPTED BY THE SEA AS YOU. BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT WHILE YOUR ENGLISH TWO HUNDRED. AT YOU KNOW JUNIOR COLLEGE. DE IS ADOPTED STANDARD OF MY. ENGLISH TWO HUNDRED AT. YOU KNOW CA ISSUE A. B. C. D.. AND. IN THERE WAS THIS WHOLE US DISC ISSUE OF AN ALIGNMENT SO THAT CLASS AGO SO HOW WE DOING THIS ALIGNMENT WE HAD THAT HEARING ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO FOUR YEARS AGO. AND WE IMPROVE THAT. A LINE IT HAS LOST ITS UNITS A COST ISSUE IT IS ALIGNMENT HAS IMPROVED IN LARGE PART DUE TO. A. LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS ARE CREATING ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFERS THAT WAS A BIG STEP FORWARD. AND ARE A LOT OF WORK OF FACULTY AT THE COMMUNICABLE EDGES AND CAL STATE UNIVERSITY ARE COMING TOGETHER AND CREATING A COMMON COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM. AND DEVELOPING A. MODEL CURRICULUM FOR VARIOUS SUBJECT AREAS. SO IT HAS IMPROVED. IT'S GOTTEN BETTER THE STATE HAS INVESTED A LOT OF. TIME AND MONEY. INTO IMPROVING THE THE TRANSFER PATHWAY HOW MUCH BETTER FIFTY PERCENT SAID FIVE PERCENT. TWENTY PERCENT. GIVE ME IF FILL. I DON'T THINK I'D I HAVE A. SENATE MIND I I THINK IT'S IN. I THINK IT'S IMPROVED CONSIDERABLY I WOULD SAY IF THAT HELPS I THINK IT'S IMPROVE CONSIDERABLY FOR STUDENTS. BUT THERE'S STILL A WAYS TO GO. WE'VE WRITTEN OUR OFFICE IS WRITTEN ABOUT THE ISSUE OF. STUDENTS GRADUATING WITH AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFERRED COMMITTEE COLLEGE AND THEN THAT. DEGREE. I OR THAT THE CONCENTRATION WITH THAT WITHIN THAT DEGREE IS NOT CONSIDERED SENATOR. SIMILAR. BY THE CAL STATE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS AND SO FOR THAT STUDENT. TACTIC READ IS NOT GIVE THEM A GUARANTEE AND AND AND TO TO TO GET OUT AND SIXTY MORE UPPER DIVISION UNITS WHAT AND ONE TOLL GRIPPED HIM FOR THE DRAGON HERE YOU GUYS WANT TO GET OUT HERE. BUT DE WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS. COME SEE ME BECAUSE WHEN I HEAR PEOPLE TELL ME ALL ITS CONSIDERABLE IMPROVEMENT MY LITTLE BRAIN TELLS ME. THAT IS PROBABLY NOT AS MUCH AS I WANT IN SO IT'S THAT'S A SOFT NUMBER. SOMEONE AND KNOW WHAT IT IS BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING BUDGET MONEY ELLIS GO THIS YEAR'S SHOES IF YOU DECIDE TO TRANSFER FROM ONE SEE ISSUED ANOTHER SERIOUS YOU. FOR WHATEVER REASON. HOW EASY TRANSFER RATE BETWEEN CSU TO SEE ISSUE? MAYBE I COULD ASK THE. FASTER SO WELL THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE MIGHT BETTER BE ABLE TO ANSWER IT LATER ON ON THE IN THE THIRD PANEL. WE HAVE A AND REALLY MANAGEMENT EXPERT WITH THIS IS A MONEY ISSUE THOUGH. WELL. FROM OUR VANTAGE POINT BETWEEN SEE ISSUES THAT WOULD BE A ZERO SUM GAME I MEAN WHAT WHAT WE WOULD HAVE IT YOU'D HAVE ONE STUDENT. A LEAVING A PARTICULAR SPOT OPEN ON THE CAMPUS AT THE TRANSFERRING FROM. MOVING TO ANOTHER CAMPUS THAT HAS AN OPEN. ENROLLMENT SLOT SO REALLY TO ZERO SUM GAME BETWEEN THE CAMPUSES SO. I WOULD SAY THAT THERE'S ANY SORT OF COST SAVINGS IF THERE'S A TRANSFER OF DEATH ONE SKIN FROM MY NOTES SAY HERE THAT. IF YOU REDUCE THE AMOUNT A UNITS OF THE STUDENT HAS TO TAKE. MY WILL BY NO ONE. BECAUSE THEY WAS ABLE TO TRANSFER SO I DIDN'T HAVE TO TAKE. A HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE UNITS I ONLY TAKE HUNDRED TWENTY TO GET A DEGREE. I WOULD SAY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION AND FUNDING. WELL ON THAT FRONT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF UNITS IN ORDER TO GRADUATE FROM A C. ISSUE OTHER REYES LAUGHING BEHIND YOU RIGHT NOW SO GO AHEAD WEALTH OF ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANTED TO POINT OUT WITHOUT IS THAT STARTING MANY YEARS AGO. WE TOOK OF A REAL CLOSE LOOK AT ALL OF OUR DEGREES TO SEE HOW MANY OF THEM WERE IN EXCESS OF WHAT THE TYPICAL HUNDRED TWENTY UNITS IN ORDER TO GRADUATE. THINK THAT TIME THE NUMBER WAS ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR KEY OF OUR. OF OUR DEGREES REQUIRED ONLY HUNDRED TWENTY GRADUATE SINCE THAT TIME WE'VE MOVED TO NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR. I DEGREES NEEDING ONE HUNDRED TWENTY UNITS ONLY. THE NEXT THE ADDITIONAL FIVE PERCENT ARE USUALLY IN THE ENGINEERING FIELD OF THE LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE LIKE I THINK WE MADE. A COLOSSAL CHANGES ADMINISTRATIVELY OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS IN THAT AREA. SO YOU DON'T HAVE A SITUATION WHERE IN ORDER TO GRADUATE. YOU NEED TO TAKE A HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MINIMUM I THINK ONE ISSUE THAT I THINK LA WAS RAISED IN THE PAST RECENT PAST HAS BEEN. WHEN YOU HAVE THE NUMBER OF COMMITTEE COLLEGES STUDENTS ENTERING WITH MORE THAN SAY SIXTY SEVENTY EIGHTY UNITS. THAT'S MORE UNITS BEING TAKEN BY THOSE STUDENTS THE NECESSARY TO ONE GET A A. OR TO TO THAN USE OVER THE C. ISSUE SO YOU HAVE MORE UNITS BEING CONSUMED SO TO SPEAK BY A STUDENT. THEN WHAT WOULD NEED TO BE. AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW IF IF THE LA WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON THAT THEY CAN BUT FROM OUR VANTAGE POINT. THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF. ART AND SCIENCE TO IT I THINK YOU KNOW STUDENTS ARE ENTERING THEIR COLLEGE YEARS MAYBE AS A COMMITTEE COLLEGE STUDENT OR EVEN IN THE C. ISSUE. AND SOME OF THEM DON'T QUITE KNOW YET WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO WITH THEIR LIVES SO THEY'RE EXPLORING DIFFERENT DEGREES RIGHT YOU MIGHT ENTER AS A. AS A CHEM MAJOR AND YOU MAY DECIDE CAM ISN'T MY THING YOU MAY WANT TO SWITCH TO A DIFFERENT GREE. SO THOSE UNITS COULD BE ACCUMULATED IN WAYS IN WHICH. THIS DUDE HAD INTENDED TO GO TOWARDS BUT THEN OPTED TO CHANGE WHICH WOULD REQUIRE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO TAKE ADDITIONAL COURSES TO TAKE A DIFFERENT AGREE UNDERSTANDUNDERSTAND YEAH. OKAY SO. MY WHOLE ISSUE DRIVING THIS DISCUSSION IS. FOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE I THINK DESY ISSUE DOES NEED TO BE FUNDED AT A HIGHER LEVEL. BECAUSE I THINK THE THIRTY THREE PERCENT THAT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED ISN'T REALLY. RELEVANT TO WHAT WE NEED IN THAT IN THIS SOCIETY WANT FOR THE FUTURE. ADDITIONALLY THOUGH I HEAR WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S DOING I THINK SO I SQUEEZE IN THIS YEAR'S CHOOSES THAT WENT WHEN IF I WAS HIM I'D USE IN OKAY. I'M GIVEN MONEY TO THE COMMITTEE CALLED THIS YEAR'S USE AND UNIVERSITIES AND YOU GUYS JUST BECAUSE WE PLAY NICE TO STREAMLINED. STREAMLINE THIS PROCESS I SEE WHERE YOU HAVE YOUR THREE OBJECTIVES FAIR COMPENSATION I AGREE THAT'S WONDERFUL. INCREASING ACCESS THAT'S NEAT. IMPROVING GRADUATION RATES BUT I THINK YOU ALSO AND LOOK AT A FOURTH ELEMENT OUT BE STREAMLINING THE COURSE SCHEDULED TO TRANSFER LEVELS. SO THAT THEY'RE MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE AND CHEAPER. IN IN ACTUALLY SAY THE TIME FOR THE STUDENTS SO. EVEN THOUGH I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE AND I TOLD EVERYBODY THAT I WOULD BE SUPPORTING THIS ISSUES ON THE INCREASE IN FUNDING. I AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR IN THE SENSE THAT WE NEED TO SEE SOME MORE EFFORT ON THEM AS THE SOLE ISSUE TRANSFER. IN TRANSIT TRANSPARENCY BETWEEN THE WHOLE SYSTEM TO GET PEOPLE IN AND OUT. SO THEY GO AND GET A JOB AND GET OUT OF THE SCHOOLS IN. LIFE WILL BE GOOD I WON'T GO INTO A LOT OF DETAIL ABOUT THAT BUT ONE THING I WANT TO POINT OUT IS IN GENERAL WE HAVE BEEN REALLY WORKING ON. YOU KNOW CREATING A LOT OF THE MINISTRY OF STREAMLINES AND ALSO A LOT OF OTHER SUPPORTS THAT YOU HEAR FROM THAT THE TWO PRESIDENTS WE HAVE HERE TODAY AND ALSO FROM ANOTHER COLLEAGUE OF MINE. ABOUT WHAT WE'VE DONE IN TERMS OF MOVING THE NEEDLE IN TERMS OF GRADUATION RATES OF THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF THAT'S HAPPENING BUT WE'LL GET INTO THAT LIVE THE LIFE AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO BECAUSE LIKE. IS GUYS LIKE ME HAVE BEEN A PER FOR SIX YEARS WATCHING HIS ROLL THROUGH AND AND A LITTLE HERE AND I REMEMBER I AM WEIRD BRING THEM MEMBER SENT ME TOLD ME FIVE YEARS AGO SHALL. WAIT TO SEE SOMETHING HAPPEN. AND AS WE SUPPORT DSE ISSUES WHICH I'M A GRADUATE OF CSU CHICO. THANKS THANK YOU AND I KNOW THAT THE NEXT ISSUE IS RELATED TO TO THIS BECAUSE MORE SUCCESS IN TWO HELPS WITH THE OVERALL. A FUNDING BY I JUST WANNA KNOW TO AS MR CHAVEZ. STATED THAT THE WHOLE THIRTY THREE PERCENT IN THE MASTER PLAN. VERSUS FORTY SOMETHING PERCENT THAT THE FEW THINGS ONE THE MASTER PLAN WAS NEVER AND LOST NINETY STATE STATUTE NINETEEN SIXTY. AND THEN FIFTY EIGHT YEARS LATER I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY THAT THAT COLLEGE NEEDS ARE DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT JUST JUSTIFY YOUR OWN COMMON SENSE WHAT IT TAKES TO HAVE A GOOD PAYING JOB. TODAY AND TOMORROW VERSES WHAT YOU NEEDED NINETEEN SIXTY AND PLUS WE HAVE HEARINGS ALL THE TIME THAT WE TALK ABOUT THE DEGREE GAP AND SO HOW ARE YOU GOING TO EVER REACH. THAT ONE MILLION DEGREE GAP. IF YOU DON'T SIGNIFICANTLY HOW RAMP UP. ACCESS TO THE CSU SO. WHETHER OR NOT THAT WE WANT TO MEMORIALIZE THIS AND AUTHOR A NEW LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL AND SAY THAT THAT THE GOAL SHOULD BE. FORTY PERCENT OR FIFTY PERCENT OR WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS. HOLDING BACK ON THIS ON THIS. NUMBER FROM THE PAST THAT REALLY WASN'T NECESSARILY EVEN STATEWIDE SYSTEMS UP THERE. AS FAR AS AS AS THAT SELL ALL KNOW THAT BUT YOU OVERALL BIG PICTURE WE WE HEAR LOUD AND CLEAR THAT. THE ALLOCATION THAT THE THAT THREE PERCENT HER AS YOU SAY ACTUALLY LASSEN THREE PERCENT TWO POINT SEVEN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE OF WHAT. HAVE HAS TO BE SPENT BY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. DOESN'T MEET THE OVERALL NEEDS AS FAR AS.% COURSE SPENDING. ACCESS AYE I WILL NOTE THAT THAT ONE THING THAT. YOU KNOW IT'S CERTAIN IT'S OUR INTENTION TO DO ALL WE CAN TO. ADEQUATELY FUND YOU SEEN SINCE YOU WERE GONNA DO THAT. AFTER A MEMBER REVISED THE NUMBERS COME OUT. BUT IF THE IF THERE IS A FINAL NUMBER THAT COMES EITHER IN THE IN THE. IN THE AYE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE OR YOU KNOW. BY WHATEVER REASON THAT THAT'S OUT THERE IS AN. OPPORTUNITY TO ONE SEVENTY ONE I THINK THAT WE WANT TO FOCUS ON WHAT WE THINK. OUR OUR PRIORITIES ARE TOP PRIORITIES THAT'S ACCESS AND SO. WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT WE REVISIT THAT SAFE THAT. MAYBE A SIMPLE THING WHEN YOU PUT MAKE YOUR CHART FOR THAT BUT THAT IS THAT THE NEXT BUCKET THEY GETS BUILT BECAUSE. AGAIN THAT'S THAT'S OUR TOP PRIORITY. SO WITH THAT. WE WILL. HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN. ANY QUESTIONS OVER HERE ALL THIS ISSUE OPENED AND REVISITED AFTER THE MAY REVISE AND. PULLED OUT HERE FOR. THE CHANCES OFFICE AS WELL AS TO. CSU PRESIDENTS ON THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE ACROSS YEAH SYSTEM. SO WELCOME BACK PRESIDENT NELSON AND I THINK THIS IS MISTER PRESIDENT CASTRO IS YOUR FIRST TIME DIRECT ME CATS AYE YES HI WELCOME TO KEEP. YEAH I THINK WE'RE GONNA START FIRST WITH. JEFF GOLD WITH THE. CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE GIVE THE. OVERVIEW OF THE SYSTEM WIDE PERSPECTIVE ON THE GRADUATION. INITIATIVE. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD MORNING JEFF GOLD ASSISTANT VICE CHANCELLOR STUDENT SUCCESS BUT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CHANCES OFFICE. IT'S A REAL PRIVILEGE TO BE HERE TODAY AND HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M THRILLED TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT ONE OF MY FAVORITE SUBJECTS THE GRADUATION THAT SHOULD'VE. THIS IS OUR SIGNATURE. PERFECT TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS TO EARN A HIGH QUALITY CUTLERY TO GREET THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. WHAT THE SAME TIME HAVING INCREDIBLY INTENTIONAL FOCUS ON CLOSING EQUITY GAPS ACROSS THE SYSTEM? WHICH REPRESENTS THE MOST IMPORTANT WORK THAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. YOU KNOW AYE AYE REFLECTING NOW ON THE LAST PANEL AND SEVEN MEN CHAVEZ YOUR YOUR COMMENTS AND YOUR WAITING TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING. I HOPE THIS PANEL ANSWER THAT QUESTION THERE HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF EFFORT. A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MOMENTUM AND EARLY INDICATORS OF SUCCESS BUT I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY ABOUT THE GRAD INITIATIVE. SO YOU HAVE A HANDOUT THAT I PASSED OUT TO YOU I'M GONNA GO THROUGH IT FAIRLY BRIEFLY BECAUSE I WANT TO PROVIDE TIME. NOT JUST TO GIVE YOU AN OVERVIEW AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL OF THE EFFORTS BUT TO PROVIDE TIME FOR OUR PRESIDENT'S. PRESIDENT CASTRO FOR PRESIDENT'S DAY AT PRESIDENT NELSON FROM SACRAMENTO WHO HAVE JOINED US I THINK IT IS A TRUE TESTAMENT. TO HOW WOULD THIS INITIATIVE HAS INFUSED THE ARTERIES OF OUR CAMPUS IN THE LEADERSHIP THAT WE HAVE. THAT OUR PRESIDENTS HAVE TAKEN TIME OUT OF THEIR BUSY SCHEDULES TO JOIN US A THANK YOU BOTH AS WELL. IN OUR PACKETS I'M GONNA START WITH THE HIGH LEVEL STORY ABOUT THE DATA. IT'S IF YOU LOOK ON PAGE ONE OF THE PACKET. THERE IS A YOU'LL NOTICE THREE LINES THAT REPRESENT THE GRADUATION RATES OF FRESHMEN STUDENTS OVER THE LAST FORTY YEARS ARE STILL IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. AND WITHOUT GOING OVER THE NUMBERS IN DETAIL THE RED LINE. SHOWS THE FOR YOU SINCE YOU GRADUATE AS FRESHMEN IN FOUR YEARS OR LESS THE GREEN NINE FIVE YEARS ARE LASSEN THE BLUE LINE AT THE TOP STUFF SIX YEARS OR LESS. WHAT YOU WILL NOTICE FROM THIS CHART? AGAIN IS THE INCREDIBLE MOVEMENT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE FIRST THIRTY YEARS OR SO YEARS OF THE HISTORY OF OUR GRADUATION RATES. YOU'LL NOTICE THAT WE HAVE SOME PRETTY INCREMENTAL AND SMALL IMPROVEMENTS IN TERMS OF. IMPROVEMENTS IN GRADUATION RATES IF YOU KINDA SQUINT YOUR EYES AND LOOK AT THAT TAIL END OF THE LAST TEN YEARS WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED INTENTIONALLY ON GRADUATION RATES FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. YOU'LL SEE A FAIRLY PRECIPITOUS MOVEMENT AND ALL THREE LINES NORTHWARDS SO THIS REPRESENTS OUR CONCERTED EFFORTS SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE IS A SYSTEM. UP TO PUT STUDENT SUCCESS FIRST AND TO FOCUS ON IT INTENTIONALLY AND ALL CAMPUSES A QUICK REMINDER FROM THE PANEL BEFORE IS THAT. THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS CAMPEONATOS FAMILIES EVERY ONE PERCENTAGE POINT HERE MAY SEEM LIKE A SMALL NUMBER MOVING FROM FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT TO FIFTY NINE PERCENT. BUT THAT REPRESENTS IMPROVEMENT FOR HUNDREDS OF FAMILIES HUNDREDS OF COMMUNITIES AND FOR THE STATE OF SOUTH. SAY THEY GET EVERYONE PERCENT HAS HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS BECAUSE WE HAVE AS WE MENTIONED BEFORE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND STUDENTS OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND AFTER. HE'S EVERYONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASES HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS THAT THAT ATTAINED AGREE THAT MAYBE THAT MAY NOT HAVE. HAVE HAD WE NOT OTHERWISE. HAVE THESE EFFORTS A PLACE. SO THIS EFFORT IS REALLY A STRATEGIC EFFORT THAT IS BASED ON THE PHILOSOPHY. WE PUT A STAKE IN THE GROUND AND MEASURE PROGRESS SLIDE TWO SHOWS US HOW WE WENT ABOUT MEASURING THAT AND HOW WE SET UP THE THE THE. AMBITIOUS GOALS THAT WE HAVE. THE SLIDE SHOWS UP HERE GROUP FOR CINEMA STATE WHAT WE DID TWO YEARS AGO WE SET UP THESE BENCHMARK AMBITIOUS GOALS. IS THAT WE FOUND PEER DATA FOR EACH ONE OF OUR TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES AND SET A PLOT SO THAT EACH CAMPUS WOULD HAVE GRADUATION RATES IN THE TOP QUARTILE THE TOP TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. OF THEIR NATIONAL PEERS ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT WE SENATE GROWTH THAT TRAJECTORY FOR THEM TO INCREASE BEYOND THAT. SO WASN'T ENOUGH FOR THOSE CAMPUSES TO BE AS GOOD AS THEIR PEERS ARE TODAY. THE BILL THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE WAS TO GET INTO TO BE THE BASS IN THEY TO INCREASE THAT ALL THE WAY THROUGHOUT. SO THERE'S A WEBSITE WHERE YOU CAN SEE FOR EACH CAMPUS AYE WE SET THIS OUT. AND AND WHERE IT'S TAKING US. RETURN TO SIDE THREE IT BRINGS US TO THE AGGREGATE OF THOSE TWENTY THREE CAMPUS SCHOOLS WHICH ARE INCREDIBLY AMBITIOUS. WHAT FROM THE LEFT YOU CAN SEE THE FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE UNDERNEATH THE TASSEL IS A TWENTY THREE PERCENT WERE WE SET NOW? AND WHERE WE'RE HEADED IS FORTY PERCENT BY YEAR BY YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. ALTHOUGH TH WAY THROUGHOUT WE HAVE A FOCUS ON ALL STUDENTS. YOU CAN READ THE NUMBERS I WANT YOUR YOUR TAKE AWAY FROM THE SLIGHT TO BE THAT IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE NUMBERS. BEHIND THE TWENTY THESE PERCENTAGES OF ONE I REITERATE THAT THIS IS HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS OF IMPROVEMENT. AND THAT EACH ONE OF THE STUDENTS IS A STUDENT'S LIFE. AND. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING CANNOT BE UNDERSTATED. GIVING ON NOTICE ON THE BOTTOM IS THAT THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP GOAL OF HAVING ZERO EQUITY GAPS THROUGHOUT THEIR SYSTEM IS WHAT DRIVES MOST OF US INDEED. IF YOU WALK THE HALLS OF OUR CAMPUSES AND YOU HAPPEN TO RUN INTO FACULTY STAFF ADMINISTRATORS THEY WILL OFTEN TELL YOU THAT THAT IS A PRIMARY DRIVER OF WHY THEY GET UP IN THE MORNING. Y. THAT SO THEY ARE SO PROUD TO BE PART OF THE CSU AS THIS INHERENT DRIVE TO DO BETTER FOR MOST UNDERSERVED STUDENTS. FIVE FOUR SHOWS YOU HOW WE WENT ABOUT ORGANIZING THIS WORK. AFTER WE SET THESE AMBITIOUS GOALS WITH A THAT WITH THAT. CROSSBREED BOTH OF CAMPUS CONSTITUENTS WITHIN ONE ABOUT ASSN THE CAMPUSES WHAT THEIR PLANS WERE TO HIT THE SCHOOLS. AND WHEN WE LOOK THROUGH THE PLANS AND ANALYZE THEM THERE WERE REALLY SIX MAJOR FOCAL AREAS THAT CAME ABOUT. STARTING FROM THE RIGHT ADMINISTRATIVE BARRIERS WHICH IS REMOVING IMPEDIMENTS TO STUDENTS PROGRESS TOWARDS A DEGREE. LEVERAGING DATA TO MAKE BETTER DECISIONS ABOUT STUDENT SUCCESS. BEING CREATIVE ABOUT THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT THAT WE PROVIDE TO OUR STUDENTS TO ENSURE THAT OUR LOW INCOME STUDENTS HAVE THE PATH TO THE DEGREE THAT THEY NEED. OF STUDENT ENGAGEMENT WELL BEING AS THE NEXT ONE WHICH REALLY CREATES THAT SENSE OF BELONGING THIS NOT JUST IN THE CLASSROOM. BUT WITH CO CURRICULAR THAT CONNECTING OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM. THE ROLE THAT MANAGEMENT IS SOMETHING THAT OUR STUDENTS WILL TELL US IS ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL COMPONENTS WHICH IS DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS HAVE THE COURSES THEY NEED. WHEN THEY NEED THEM AND LASTLY I JUST SPEND A MINUTE ON ACADEMIC PREPARATION BECAUSE IT'S AN AREA WHERE I'M INCREDIBLY PROUD. BEGINNING THIS FALL FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME IN HISTORY THE SYSTEM WE HAVE COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED THE WAY THAT WE ARE PROVIDING DEVELOPMENTAL SUPPORT EDUCATION. SO ASSEMBLYMAN CHAVEZ MENTIONED LAST PANEL IS WAITING FOR THE TIME IS WE NEED TO SEE THE PROGRESS. THIS IS A MONUMENTAL THIS IS TRANSFORMATIVE THAT'S IS CHANGING THE APPROACH THAT WE HAVE TO PROVIDING THE SUPPORT THAT STUDENTS NEED. AND INSTEAD OF THEM COMING TO US AS STUDENTS HAVE FOR YEARS AND YEARS RECEIVING THE MESSAGE FORTY PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS RECEIVING THE MESSAGE THAT THEY'RE NOT QUITE READY TO BE AT THE UNIVERSITY. THAT THEY NEED TO TAKE COURSES THAT WALKOUT FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME IN OUR HISTORY BEGINNING THIS FALL WE ARE TELLING HIM THAT NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE WE ARE READY FOR YOU. AND THAT IS A HUGE TRANSFORMATION TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORT THAT STUDENTS NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT IN THAT FIRST YEAR TO MAKE SURE THEY GOT TO GET OFF TO A GREAT START. BUT LAST TWO SLIDES I WANT TO SHOW YOU THE IMPACT OF THIS I THINK CAN'T BE UNDERSTATED. AGAIN DEAR DO YOU DO TO OUR SHARED NUMBER. WE WILL WHEN WE HIT THESE AMBITIOUS GOALS BECOME THE LEADING THE NATIONAL FLAGSHIP FOR PUBLIC FOR YOUR COMPREHENSIVES IN THE YEAH AROUND THE NATION. SO WE SET GOALS TO BE AT THE TOP OF OUR PEERS WHEN WE HIT THOSE GOALS WHEN HE. BECAUSE THE AMBITIOUS TARGETS THAT I REVIEWED WE WILL BE THE LEADER IT SERVES A FOR YOUR COMPREHENSIVE UNIVERSITIES AND NOT JUST BE KNOWN FOR THE STUDENTS THAT WE LIVE IN THE DOOR. BUT THE STUDENTS THAT WE GRADUATE. LASTLY I JUST WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH THREE CLOSING THOUGHTS WHICH IS THE LAST BY. IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO TELL FROM THE THE CONVERSATION ALREADY THE STAKES ARE INCREDIBLY HIGH. I I BELIEVE THAT. YOU HAD TESTIMONY FROM THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE PAST TO TALK ABOUT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE WORK WE'RE DOING AND THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF THAT GAP THAT DEGREE GAP THAT SINCE THE PAID IT TO BE EXIST IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BETWEEN THOSE WHO HAVE BACCALAUREATE DEGREES OF THOSE THAT DON'T AND THE WORK FORCE TRENDS THAT REQUIRE THOSE DEGREES. SO THERE'S A PREDICTION FOR THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE THAT WE WILL BE ABOUT ONE POINT ONE MILLION POPULAR DEGREE SHORT BY TWENTY THIRTY. AND THE CSU IS BEING THE BIGGEST GAME IN THE STATE. WILL CONTRIBUTE OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THOSE ADDITIONAL DEGREES ADDITIONAL DEGREES BY THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY. SO WE ARE ON TRACK TO DO THAT. SECONDLY IN AGAIN AS EVIDENCED BY PRESIDENTS WHO ARE HERE TODAY CAMPUS LEADERSHIP IS ESSENTIAL AND I WANT TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND NOT JUST. YOU KNOW. BRING OUT THAT PLATITUDE. IT IS REALLY INCREDIBLE WHEN YOU WALK THROUGH OUR CAMPUSES AND YOU SEE THE INTENTIONALITY IN THE FOCUS THAT WE HAVE AS A SYSTEM. NOT JUST ON THESE TWO CAMPUSES BUT ACROSS THE SYSTEM. ALL GROWING IN THE SAME DIRECTION FOR THIS INITIATIVE IT'S TRULY IMPRESSIVE AND THIS IS THE TIME THAT WE NEED THE SUPPORT OF THE STATE. WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE VERY LAST. BULLET. FOR THE DAY FOR ME WHICH IS THAT SUSTAIN STATE FIVE FUNDING IS CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS. I AM I THINK YOU HEARD IN THE LAST PANEL LOVES A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT BUT LET ME JUST REITERATE THAT STUDENT SUCCESS IS NOT FREE. WHAT I TALKED ABOUT HOW WE USE DATA TO IDENTIFY THE PEER COMPARISON GROUPS FOR OUR TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES? WE ALSO LOOKED UNDER THE HOOD A LITTLE BIT TO SEE HOW MUCH THOSE PIERCED BAND ON STUDENT SUCCESS HOW MUCH THEY SPEND ON HIRING FACULTY. TENURE TRACK FACULTY HOW MUCH THEY SPEND ON GETTING THE NEEDED ADVISORS AND SUPPORT STRUCTURE. AND ON AVERAGE THEY SPEND OVER ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED ADDITIONAL DOLLARS PER STUDENT. WHEN YOU MULTIPLY THAT BY OUR STUDENT POPULATION YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. ANNUAL INVESTMENTS OF AN ADDITIONAL HALF A MILLION DOLLARS TO GET THE RESULTS THAT WE WANT TO GET. IT'S A WITHOUT CONTEXT I LEAVE YOU THAT. WHICH IS THE IDEA THAT THIS INVESTMENT IN THAT IN THAT CSU IS AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AT ONE OF THE MOST OF THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT THAT STUDENTS THAT WILL MAKE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. PRESIDENT NELSON. HOME COURT ADVANTAGE. THEY. STINGERS UP. MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY I'M PLEASED TO REPORT BACK TO YOU ON THE PROGRESS BEING MADE SACRAMENTO STATE TO IMPROVE OUR TIME TO DEGREE. AND TO REDUCE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AS YOU'VE HEARD ME TESTIFY BEFORE SACRAMENTO STATE IN THE MIST OF A CULTURE CHANGE THAT IS DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO TAKE A FULL COURSE LOAD OF FIFTEEN CREDITS. FIFTEEN PLUS FIFTEEN EQUALS THIRTY TIMES FOUR EQUALS ONE TWENTY EQUALS A DEGREE. TO KEEP SEX EIGHT END OF THE BARGAIN WITH THE STUDENTS WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THE CLASSES ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM AND THAT WE SUPPORT THEM ACADEMICALLY AND FINANCIALLY. THE CULTURE CHANGE ISRAEL AND HAS BEEN EMBRACED BY OUR STUDENTS. BECAUSE OF OUR FINISH IN FOUR AND OUR THROUGH INTO. CAMPAIGNS SEVENTY PERCENT OF OUR INCOMING GRADUATES STUDENTS NOW EXPECT TO GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS. AND EIGHTY THREE PERCENT OF THE INCOMING. FALL TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FRESHMAN PLEDGE TO TAKE A FULL COURSE LOAD WHICH IS UPSET FROM SIXTY TWO PERCENT THE YEAR BEFORE. SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN ACADEMIC HERE WE HAVE ADDED SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX ADDITIONAL COURSES. THAT AVERAGE UNIT LOAD FOR THE FRESHMAN'S FIRST SEMESTER IS NOW FOURTEEN POINT SIX. UNITS UP FROM A TRADITIONAL AVERAGE OF ONE OF ELEVEN TO TWELVE UNITS. WE ARE OFFERING SUMMER INCENTIVE GRANTS% AND WE'VE HIRED A ACADEMIC ADVISORS AND MADE DEGREE PLANS ACCESSIBLE ONLINE WITH SMART PLANNER. AND SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WE HAVE BEGUN THE PROCESS OF HIRING OVER ONE HUNDRED SIXTY ADDITIONAL FACULTY MEMBERS. I'M PLEASED TO TELL YOU THAT THESE INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE COME OUT THAT HAVE YOU COSTS ARE PAYING OFF. IN ONE YEAR LOAN FROM TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN OUR FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE IMPROVED OVER THREE PER. SANTEE POINTS FOR ME EIGHT POINT EIGHT TO TWELVE POINT ZERO A THIRTY SIX PERCENT INCREASE. FIFTY ONE PERCENT OF OUR FRESHMEN STUDENTS ARE NOW TAKING AND PASSING FIFTEEN UNITS IN THEIR FIRST SEMESTER. FOR ME PERSONALLY IT HAS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY THAT THESE. GAINES IMPROVE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF ALL STUDENTS INCLUDING STUDENTS FROM DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS. I'M CLOUT IT IN CREDIBLY PROUD TO REPORT. THAT WE HAVE SEEN AT LEAST TEN PERCENTAGE POINT. INCREASED IN ALL ETHNIC AND SOCIO ECONOMIC. GROUPS COMPLETING FIFTEEN OR MORE UNITS IN THEIR. FIRST SEMESTER. AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS HAVE A FIFTEEN POINT ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN COMPLETING FIFTEEN OR MORE UNITS LATINO STUDENTS HAD A TWELVE POINT THREE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE. LOW INCOME PAL STUDENTS HAD A TEN POINT SEVEN PERCENT. IN POINT INCREASE IN COMPLETING FIFTEEN. YOU NOT SIR MORE THAT'S ABSOLUTELY HUGE. AND DAY BY DAY THAT SEX STATE WE'RE SEEING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP BETWEEN ANGLO AND HISPANIC STUDENTS NEARER TO THE POINT WHERE IT IS DISAPPEARING. I KNOW THAT THIS MAY BE HARD TO BELIEVE. BUT THE SIX YEAR GRADUATION RATE. ACHIEVEMENT GAP BETWEEN HISPANIC AND ANGLO STUDENTS HAS BEEN ELIMINATED. THE SIX YEAR GRADUATION RATE FOR HISPANIC STUDENTS IS NOW ONE HALF PERCENT. HIGHER. THEN CAUCASIAN STUDENTS A SEVEN PERCENT INCREASE. BOB PERCENTAGE POINT GAP. HAS BEENA SEVEN PERCENT. PERCENTAGE POINT GAP HAS BEEN CLOSED AND THE ELIMINATED. AS OUR EFFORTS ARE SUSTAIN FOR THE FRESHMEN AND TRANSFER STUDENTS WHO WERE ARRIVED ON CAMPUS IN THE FALL OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. I EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO REPORT EVEN LARGER GAINS NEXT YEAR. HOWEVER WE MUST REMEMBER THAT NONE OF THESE ACTIONS ARE COST FREE. LABOR CARD ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS FROM THE STATE AND FROM THE CSU SYSTEM. THIS SUMMER WE ARE INVESTING. TO THE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS INCENTIVE GRANTS TO INCREASE THE USE OF THE SUMMER SESSION WHERE FOR THE FIRST TIME THE STUDENTS WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE YEAR ROUND TELL. THE HUNDRED NEW HUNDRED SIXTY NEW FACULTY WHO ARE PROVIDING THE COURSES THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR THE STUDENTS TO TAKE A FULL FIFTEEN UNIT COURSE LOAD. MUST BE PAID AND CANNOT BE PAID BY ONE TIME MONEY. THE SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SIX COURSE SECTIONS THAT WE'VE ADDED IN THE LAST TWO YEARS MUST BE TAUGHT. AGAIN. AND THEY MUST BE SCHEDULED. THOSE COURSE SECTIONS COST THE UNIVERSITY SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS THAT CURRENTLY I DO NOT HAVE IN NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET. AS I SAID EARLIER BECAUSE OF OUR FINISH IN FOUR CAMPAIGN OVER SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS. INCOMING STUDENTS EXPECT TO GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS WE CANNOT LET THEM DOWN AND WE MUST NOT LET THEM DOWN. THE TRUTH IS THAT GIVEN THE PROPOSED STATE ALLOCATIONS NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET IS LOOKING TO BE ESPECIALLY DIFFICULTY. DIFFICULT I HAVE ASKED EACH OF MY DEPARTMENTS TO PLAN ON A THREE PERCENT. TO A FOUR POINT FIVE PERCENT REDUCTION. IF WE'RE NOT FULLY FUNDED EACH OF THE ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS WILL HAVE TO SEE THESE CUTS. AND THESE CUTS WILL HURT OUR STUDENTS AND WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THE SUCCESS THAT I'VE JUST OUTLINED FOR YOU. AT RISK ARE ALL THE GAINS THAT WE HAVE MADE TO THIS DAY. WE AT SAC STATE AND IN THE CSU SYSTEM HAVE DELIVERED ON THE LEGISLATURE'S MANDATE TO IMPROVE TIME TO DEGREE. GIVEN THAT CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY FINDS ITSELF IN A SURPLUS THIS YEAR. I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR FULLY FUND THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES REQUEST. SO THAT WE DO NOT LET OUR STUDENTS DOWN AND SO THAT WE DON'T IRREPARABLY HARM CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YES WE'LL GET INTO THAT AFTER I HEAR FROM MR CASTRO WITHOUT SOME FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS. WELL GOOD MORNING. CHAIR MCCARTY AND MEMBERS THE BULLDOGS IN THE HORNETS GET ALONG REALLY WELL AND I'M HAPPY TO TO JOIN PRESIDENT NELSON HERE IN THE CAPITAL TODAY. AND MY OTHER COLLEAGUES. TO SHARE HOW THE STATE'S INVESTMENT IN OUR GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. HAS SIGNIFICANTLY STRENGTHENED FRESNO STATE'S ABILITY TO SERVE AND ARE VERY TALENTED AND IS DIVERSE STUDENTS. FRESNO STATE WITH ITS TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS IS THE LARGEST UNIVERSITY IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. AN AREA OF THE STATE THAT YOU KNOW HAS EXTRAORDINARY POTENTIAL. NINETY PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS COME FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY. OVER SEVENTY PERCENT OF THEM ARE FIRST GENERATION TO COLLEGE STUDENTS AND OVER SIXTY PERCENT ARE PELL GRANT RECIPIENTS. I AM BRACE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE THE STUDENTS BECAUSE I AM THE FIRST PRESIDENT OF FRESNO STATE FROM THE REGION AND I SHARE MUCH IN COMMON. WITH. ARE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS. OVER EIGHTY PERCENT OF OUR GRADUATES REMAIN IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN BECOME LEADERS IN A WIDE ARRAY OF PROFESSIONS AN ASIAN AMERICAN NATIVE AMERICAN. I WONDER SERVING INSTITUTION. AND BECAUSE OF THIS THE STAKES ARE HIGH FOR CALIFORNIA. AND FOR THE ENTIRE CENTRAL VALLEY. LIKE THE OTHER TWENTY TWO CSU CAMPUSES FRESNO STATE HAS SET AMBITIOUS GOALS FOR STUDENT SUCCESS. FOR EXAMPLE OUR SIX YEAR GRADUATION RATES TARGET IS SEVENTY PERCENT AND WE'RE CLOSING IN ON SIXTY PERCENT. OUR TWO YEAR AND FOUR YEAR TRANSFER GRADUATION RATES HAVE ALSO INCREASED WITH THE TWO YEAR TRANSFER GRADUATION RATE. GOING FROM TWENTY TWO PERCENT TO ALMOST TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT IN THE PAST TWO YEARS ALONE. THE STUDENT SUCCESS GOALS ARE CENTRAL A A CENTRAL COMPONENT OF OUR CAMPUS STRATEGIC PLAN AND CONSISTENT WITH OUR MISSION AT FRESNO STATE WHICH IS TO BOLDLY EDUCATE AND EMPOWER. OUR STUDENTS FOR SUCCESS. OUR CAMPUS AND THE REGION ARE ALIGNED IN OUR VISION FOR STUDENT SUCCESS. BUT THIS VISION AS PRESIDENT NELSON SAID. I CAN ONLY BE FULLY REALIZED WITH THE STATE RESOURCES THAT ARE PROVIDED NOW AND IN THE FUTURE FOR GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. WE HAVE YEARS GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE FUNDING THIS YEAR. A TOTAL OF ABOUT FOUR POINT THREE FIVE MILLION AND PERMANENT FUNDS AND ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY SIX THOUSAND AND ONE TIME FUNDS. TO HIRE NEW TENURE TRACK FACULTY. ACADEMIC ADVISORS AND STUDENT SERVICES STAFF. THE ADDITIONAL FACULTY HAVE ENABLED US TO ASSURE ALL NEW STUDENTS SAY FIFTEEN UNIT COURSE LOAD THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE BOTH A AND AND THE OTHER PRESIDENTS. ARE FOCUSED ON AND THAT KEEPS THEM ON TRACK TO GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS IF THEY ARE FRESHMEN. A AND TO YEARS IF THERE COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRANSFERS AND I KNOW THAT INCREASING COURSE LOAD IS A PRIORITY FOR FOR YOU AND FOR OTHER MEMBERS. AND SUSTAINED FUNDING IS NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS CAN CONTINUE TO GAIN ACCESS TO A FULL COURSE LOAD AND GRADUATE IN A TIMELY WAY. IN ADDITION WE HAVE ALLOCATED FUNDS FOR NEW INITIATIVES SUCH AS OUR BULLDOG RETENTION GRANTS AND THESE GRANTS ARE AWARDED TO STUDENTS WHO ARE ON TRACK TO ENROLL. IN GRADUATE BUT HAVE A FINANCIAL SHORT. I SHORTFALL OF LESS THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS AND ARE SUBJECT TO BEING CANCELED AND DROP FROM ALL CLASSES. AND IN THE PAST THAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED. BUT NOW WE HAVE AWARDED NINETY TWO GRANTS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. OF FIFTEEN OF THOSE STUDENTS GRADUATED IN SEVENTY SEVEN OF THOSE STUDENTS WERE RETAINED SO INSTEAD OF LOSING OUR STUDENTS. THEY STAYED AND THEY'RE GRADUATING AND FALL TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE AWARDED TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE GRANTS RANGING FROM FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLARS. TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR GI TWENTY TWENTY FIVE FUNDS HAVE ALSO BEEN USED TO SCALE UP SUCCESSFUL INITIATIVES. INCLUDING CO REQUISITE COURSES AND SUPPLEMENTAL INSTRUCTION. AND IN THIS ACADEMIC YEAR ALONE WE'VE BEEN ABLE THAT TWENTY SIX NEW CO REQUISITE COURSES IN THIRTY TWO NEW SECTIONS OF SUPPLEMENTAL INSTRUCTION. AND THAT'S APPROVING HIGH IMPACT PRACTICE THAT PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN RAISING COURSE GRADES IN ELIMINATING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP FOR UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS. SUPPLEMENTAL INSTRUCTION PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR PREVIOUSLY HIGH FAILURE RATE COURSES REPEAT COURSES AND GATEWAY BOTTLENECK COURSES. AND WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STUDY OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM. IS THAT STUDENTS WHO HAVE SIXTEEN OR MORE VISITS WITH ANTS SUPPLEMENTAL INSTRUCTION ERNIE MEAN FINANCIAL COURSE GRADE. OF ONE LETTER HIGHER THAN THOSE WHO ARE NOT IN THIS PROGRAM AND THE OVERALL COURSE. PASS RATES AVERAGE ABOUT NINETY FOUR PERCENT. AND WE LOOKED AT THE COHORT OF STUDENTS S.. USING THIS WHO STARTED AS FRESHMEN AND TWENTY ELEVEN TWELVE WHO PARTICIPATED IN SUPPLEMENTAL INSTRUCTION. THEIR GRADUATION RATES FOR NEARLY SIXTY FIVE PERCENT. IN COMPARISON TO STUDENTS WHO WERE NOT IN SUPPLEMENTAL INSTRUCTION. AND AS YOU KNOW WELL DIGITAL LEDGER LITERACY IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. OUR STUDENTS MUST BE ADEPT IN THIS DIGITAL AGE AND ASSEMBLYMAN CHAVEZ MENTIONED THIS EARLIER MANY ARE ALREADY SAVVY WITH TECHNOLOGY. BUT ALL OF THEM NEED TO LEARN HOW TO SOURCE TRUSTED CONTENT TO FACT FIND ANALYZE AND LEARN. AND FOR THIS REASON WE'VE INVESTED SOME OF OUR GI TWENTY TWENTY FIVE FUNDS INTO THIS AREA. OUR PROGRAM DISCOVER <u>&lt;c.green&gt; WHICH</u> OUR CAMPUSES DIGITAL INITIATIVE HAS EXPANDED FACULTY CURRICULUM LEVERAGING OPEN SOURCE DIGITAL CONTENT IN A TECHNOLOGY INFUSED LEARNING ENVIRONMENT. AND THE RESULTS OF THAT PROGRAM HAVE CONSISTENTLY DEMONSTRATED. THAT PARTICIPATING STUDENTS HAVE HIRE PURCHASE A RETENTION RATES HIGHER END OF TERM GPAS AND ARE ON TRACK TO GRADUATE ON TIME. AND THEN VERY IMPORTANTLY FOR OUR STUDENTS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SAVE AN AVERAGE OF SEVENTY PERCENT ON TEXTBOOK COSTS. FRESNO STATE SERVES A RAPIDLY GROWING REGION THAT NEEDS MORE RESIDENTS WITH A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN JEFF MENTIONED THE PP I SEE REPORT. EARLIER. WHEN I LOOK AT THAT REPORT AND I SAW THAT THEY FOUND IF YOU WERE TO DISTRIBUTE BACHELOR'S DEGREES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. ACCORDING TO POPULATION. THE VALLEY WOULD PRODUCE TWICE AS MANY. AS WE ARE TODAY. AND SO THAT IS THE GAP THAT I SEE FOR OUR REGION. AND UNFORTUNATELY WHILE THIS IS HAPPENING. DUE TO FUNDING LIMITATIONS FRESNO STATE IS NOW HAVING TO DENY ADMISSION TO FIVE THOUSAND ACADEMICALLY ELIGIBLE STUDENTS AND THIS PAST FALL FALL SEVENTEEN. AND PROBABLY MORE FOR FALL EIGHTEEN. SO I AGREE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARTY THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS NEEDED TO SUPPORT ENROLLMENT GROWTH SO THAT WE CAN ENROLL AND HELP TO GRADUATE. STUDENTS COMING FROM ARCADE THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS AS WELL AS OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND WITH OUR MANY EDUCATION BUSINESS PARTNERS WE'VE ESTABLISHED THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROMISE. ASSEMBLYMAN AROUND WILL HIS HIS HELPED US WITH THAT PROGRAM. AND THE PROMISES A COMMUNITY WIDE EFFORT TO PROMOTE COLLEGES A VIABLE OPTION FOR YOUTH IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THE PROMISE WILL ENSURE THAT IF STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS PLEDGED TO DO WHAT IT TAKES AND MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL. TO PREPARE COLLEGE WILL BE THERE FOR THEM IN THE FUTURE GUARANTEED AND WERE VERY PLEASED TO JOIN OUR AREA K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE PARTNERS. AND DEVELOPING COMMON STANDARDS TO HELP OUR FUTURE STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES MOST OF THE STUDENTS AGAIN ARE FIRST GENERATION TO COLLEGE STUDENTS. SO WE'RE TRYING TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND AND TO COMPLETE WHAT IS REQUIRED TO BE READY. FOR COLLEGE. I WANT TO END MY REMARKS WITH A VERY BRIEF STORY AND I KNOW YOU HEAR A LOT OF STORIES BUT I I THINK THIS ONE WILL MAKE AN IMPORTANT POINT. SHORTLY AFTER I WAS APPOINTED AS PRESIDENT OF FRESNO STATE AUGUST OF TWENTY THIRTEEN. A GRADUATE STUDENT CAME INTO MY OFFICE AND SHE BROUGHT HER MASTER'S PROJECT. AND THAT MASTER'S PROJECT DOCUMENTED FOR THE FIRST TIME. STUDENT FOOD SICK INSECURITY ON OUR CAMPUS. I WAS DEEPLY SADDENED TO LEARN THAT AT LEAST A THIRD OF THE STUDENTS AND THAT STUDY AT THAT TIME. SAID THAT THEY WERE FOOD INSECURE. AND SOME WERE ACTUALLY DUMPSTER DIVING NEAR MY OFFICE TO GET FOOD. MY WIFE MARY AND I IMMEDIATELY MOBILIZED OUR CAMPUS AND COMMUNITY TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT THIS CHALLENGING TO PUT A COMPREHENSIVE INITIATIVE IN PLACE TO ADDRESS IT. YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN TODAY'S WASHINGTON POST THE DOCUMENTS THIS ISSUE NATIONALLY. BUT I AM PLEASED TO SHARE THAT ARE STUDENT CUPBOARD WHICH WAS LAUNCHED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. HAS SERVED OVER A HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS. THE COVER NAME COMES FROM. OUR EXPERIENCE AS KIDS WHEN MY GRANDMOTHER WOULD OPEN A CUPBOARD AND GIVE THE FOOD THAT SHE HAD SO THAT I COULD. GET THROUGH COLLEGE AND THE SAME WITH MY WIFE AND HER GRANDMOTHER. OUR MOST RECENT DATA HAS SHOWN THAT STUDENTS WHO ABUSE THE CUPBOARD ARE DOING MUCH BETTER ACADEMICALLY. THAN THEY WERE BEFORE THEY WERE USING THE CUPBOARD. THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THE TREMENDOUS GOOD THAT COMES WHEN OUR STATE. OUR CSU AND OUR COMMUNITY COME TOGETHER TO ADDRESS A SERIOUS NEED. AND I BELIEVE THAT THE TIME IS NOW FOR US THE STATE AND THE CSU. TO CONTINUE ON THIS IS VERY POSITIVE PATH. WITH GI TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. YES IT WILL REQUIRE THE INVESTMENT OF ADDITIONAL PROMINENT STATE RESOURCES. THE I PROMISE AND I KNOW PRESIDENT NELSON PROMISES WE WILL STEWARD CAREFULLY. ON YOUR BEHALF. THIS IS ONE OF THE VERY BEST INVESTMENTS THAT WE CAN MAKE AS A STATE. IT WILL HELP TO UNLEASH THE TALENT THAT EXISTS IN EVERY HOUSEHOLD IN THE VALLEY AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IF ON THE OTHER HAND FUNDING IS NOT PROVIDED TO SUSTAIN OR GI TWENTY TWENTY FIVE EFFORTS. OUR MOMENTUM WILL BE SLOWED DRAMATICALLY. IT WILL TAKE STUDENTS LONGER TO GRADUATE BECAUSE WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EMPLOY. ENOUGH TACKLE TO TO SUSTAIN OUR FIFTEEN UNIT GUARANTEE. AND ARE POSITIVE GRADUATION RATE TRAJECTORY WILL FLATTEN OUT BECAUSE WE WILL NEED TO REDUCE AND OR ELIMINATE. SOME SUPPORT PROGRAMS FOR OUR STUDENTS. THE OVERALL QUALITY OF THE CSU EDUCATION WILL BE DIMINISHED IN THIS SCENARIO AND OUR GRADUATES WILL BE LESS PREPARED TO SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESS THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE RAPIDLY CHANGING WORKFORCE. AND IF NO ENROLLMENT GROWTH FUNDING IS PROVIDED TO THE CSU FRESNO STATE WILL HAVE TO LOSE OUR MISSIONS FOR NEW. COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRANSFERS IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY NINETEEN. WHICH WILL DECREASE ACCESS FOR UP TO A THOUSAND VALLEY STUDENTS. AS I MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING OF MY REMARKS A CENTRAL VALLEY HAS EXTRAORDINARY UNREALIZED ECONOMIC POTENTIAL. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY THROUGH ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT AND OUR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES TO UNLEASH THAT POTENTIAL. AND YOUR SUPPORT OF GI TWENTY TWENTY FIVE ONE ABLE FRESNO STATE AND THE OTHER TWENTY TWO CAMPUSES. TO ME ARE BOLD STUDENT SUCCESS GOALS CALIFORNIA WILL BENEFIT FOR DECADES TO COME FROM THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT THAT. THAT WE PROVIDE TODAY FOR OUR TALENTED STUDENTS WHO ARE THE NEXT GENERATION OF LEADERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. HELLO. LOOKING AT. PAGE ONE OF THE HANDUT THAT. CSU PROVIDED ON GRADUATION RATES IT. WASN'T VERY LONG AGO THAT. FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATES WERE BELOW TEN PERCENT. SYSTEM WIDE AND SIX YEAR GRADUATION RATES WERE BELOW FORTY PERCENT SYSTEM WIDE. SO IT'S REALLY ENCOURAGING SEE THOSE GRADUATION RATES A STEADILY INCREASING AND AND KEEP INCREASING. THE COURAGE IT'S ENCOURAGING AS WELL. THAT I CSU IS SET SUCH SUCH AMBITIOUS GOALS. OVER THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS. SEEKING TO NEARLY DOUBLE THE FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SO. I. THINK CURRY JANE TO SEE I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE. AS THE AGENDA NOTES ON THE TABLE ON PAGE EIGHT ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. CONTINUE TO PERSIST. I WHICH IS TROUBLING AND SOMETHING THAT. CAL STATE UNIVERSITY HAS PLEDGED TO REALLY ADDRESS AND AND ELIMINATE. OVER THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS. IN OUR ANALYSIS WE IDENTIFY SEVERAL. POTENTIAL AREAS FOR CS YOU TO ADVANCE GRADUATION INITIATIVE GOALS. AND. TO DO SO IN AN EFFICIENT MANNER. AND SO I'D LIKE TO. TALK ABOUT A COUPLE OF THOSE OF. POINTS THAT WE MAKE. AND IN PARTICULAR WE KNOW THAT. CSU STUDENTS CONTINUE TO ACCRUE. AND MANY MORE UNITS THAN THEY NEED TO GRADUATE. AND STUDENTS WHO WOULD ACCRUE MORE UNITS THAN THEIR DEGREE REQUIRES GENERALLY TAKE LONGER TO GRADUATE IT ALSO COSTS. THEMSELVES IN THE STATE MORE MONEY IN IT ANNA CROWDS OUT OTHER STUDENTS. SO THE AGENDA ON THE BOTTOM OF PAGE TWELVE. MENTIONS. WHAT COULD BE THE KIND OF THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE POTENTIAL? ARE FOR. BEING MORE EFFICIENT WITH EXISTING RESOURCES BY REDUCING ACCESS UNITS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAVEZ YOU MENTION THAT AND IN ISSUE ONE. I CSU RECENTLY CALCULATED THAT REDUCING JUST ONE ACCESS UNIT PERSEUS YOU GRADUATE. WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT OF FREEING UP MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED COURSE SECTIONS AND REDUCING. ACCESS UNIT TAKING BY HALF WHICH IS A BODY ABOUT TEN. UNITS PER THAT CSU GRADUATE WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT OF FREEING UP MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND COURSE SECTIONS. REPRESENTING TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND. MONEY. THE AGENDA REFERENCE IS A RECENT REPORT BY CAL STATE UNIVERSITY'S STUDENT SUCCESS NETWORK REPORT IS TITLED GET ME FROM POINT A TO POINT B. WHICH JUST. CAME OUT LAST MONTH BASED ON SURVEYS AND INTERVIEWS WITH STUDENTS THE REPORT FINDS THAT WHEN STUDENTS AREN'T ABLE TO GET INTO A COURSE THEY NEED. I THINK PRESIDENT CASTRO REFERRED TO IS GATEWAY BOTTLENECK COURSE. MANY END UP SIGNING UP FOR COURSES THEY DON'T NEED. SO THAT THEY CAN MAINTAIN A FULL TIME COURSE LOAD AND AND THAT'S AN INDICATION R. TO US THAT CSU HAS AND CONTINUES TO HAVE A. A MISMATCH OF SORTS BETWEEN THE COURSES THAT CAMPUSES OFFER. AND THE COURSES THAT STUDENTS ACTUALLY NEED A THEIR DEGREE REQUIREMENTS. NOW SEE US YES YOU ARE HAS. UNDERTAKEN EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THIS OUR. PRESIDENT NELSON MENTIONED SMART PLANNER. AND SMART PLANNERS THE TOOL TO THAT PROVIDES AYE DATA TWO CAMPUSES ON WHAT STUDENTS NEED. AMONG OTHER ATTRIBUTES AND THAT THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO HELP SO THAT'S THAT'S ENCOURAGING AS WELL THAT A SAX STATE AND OTHERS. OF ARE ARE LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE. OF THE AGENDA ALSO NOTES OF THIS ON PAGE THIRTEEN. THAT OUR STUDENTS ARM ARE REALLY ARE LOOKING FOR ADVISING THAT IS TAILORED TO THEIR MAJOR. THEY WANT MORE HELP. MAPPING OUT. TERM BY TERM THE COURSES THAT THEY THEIR REQUIREMENTS THEY NEED TO MEET IN ORDER TO GRADUATE. GOING BEYOND JUST A SEMESTER AT A TIME LOOKING OUT. FOR A FOUR YEAR PLAN WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO ACTUALLY GRADUATE AND WHAT DO THEY NEED TO TAKE. AND CAMPUSES ARE USING. TOOLS A SMART PLANNER OTHER E. ADVISING TOOLS ARE TO HELP IN THAT REGARD. WE'RE NOT AWARE OF. THE MORE SYSTEM WIDE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN. BY CS YOU THAT THAT LOOKS AT THE ROOT CAUSES OF THE PROBLEM OF ACCESS UNITS AND COMES UP WITH THAT. KIND OF PLAN. WITH SOLUTIONS TAILORED TO THOSE ROOT CAUSES BUT THAT THAT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL FOR THE SYSTEM GOING FORWARD BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR CS YOU. TO. TO USE THAT THAT THAT MONEY THEY USE FOR COURSES YEAH IN A MORE STRATEGIC WAY I'M REALLY GETTING AT WHAT STUDENTS NEED. ANOTHER STRATEGY THAT CS YOU WAS IDENTIFIED TO IDENTIFIED SPEED TIME TO DEGREE. AND AND USE RESOURCES MORE EFFICIENCY IS EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS TO TAKE ONLINE COURSES FULLY ONLINE COURSES AT OTHER CSU CAMPUSES YET THAT HAVE AVAILABLE SPACE. AGAINTHIS IS AN INITIATIVE OF THE CSU REALLY AM AND PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE. CAL STATE UNIVERSITY OFFERS THOUSANDS OF COURSES ONLINE. YET DOES SOMETHING WE LOOK AT CSU DATA INDICATES THAT ARE CURRENTLY VERY FEW STUDENTS. ACTUALLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ENROLL IN ACROSS CAMPUS MANNER YEAH IN ONLINE COURSES. ARE REASONS FOR THAT INCLUDE A LACK OF AWARENESS AMONG STUDENTS THAT THIS THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE TO THEM. AS WELL AS. WHAT WE WOULD CALL A PROBLEMATIC? CATALOG. ONLINE CATALOG OF COURSES ARE THAT'S AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS NOW CURRENTLY IF YOU GO ONLINE TO THIS. DATABASE OF ONLINE COURSES STUDENTS CAN TAKE IT'S IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE AND FIND A COURSES THAT A STUDENT MIGHT NEED SO CSU IS AND. IT IS IS REALLY GOTTEN A MESSAGE I THINK TO TO IMPROVE THAT. DATABASE IMPROVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS TO TO TAKE COURSES ARE. ELSEWHERE BECAUSE WORSE YES YOU TO STREAMLINE THAT PROCESS. TO ALLOW STUDENTS TO FIND IT RULING TO GET CREDIT FOR COURSES AND OTHER COURSES SEAT YOU REALLY COULD IMPROVE STUDENT ACCESS TO NEEDED COURSEWORK AND REDUCE THE TIME DISAGREE. SO I THINK OF. WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT WERE SEEN. A LOT OF POSITIVE SIGNS A LOT OF PROGRESS IN THE SYSTEM THERE ARE ARE ALSO IN CONTINUE TO BE OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCIES AND A USE. EFFICIENCY USE RESOURCES ARE EVEN BETTER. SO GIVEN THESE OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM GIVEN THE MANY OTHER A COMPETING COST PRESSURES ARE FACING CSU IN THE BUDGET YEAR WHICH IS A LOT OF WHAT YOU TALK ABOUT AN ISSUE ONE. I'M WE RECOMMEND. THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER PLACING A LOWER A PRIORITY ON PROVIDING FUNDING FOR THE GRAD INITIATIVE IN THE BUDGET HERE ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR THE GRAD INITIATIVE IN THE BUDGET YEAR. AND AND AND CONSIDER. FOCUSING ON SOME OTHER PRIORITIES SUCH AS WHAT YOU MENTIONED HATCHER MCCARTY. THAT ACCESS ENROLLMENT GROWTH. OKAY THAT I DO SO WE I THINK WE SUPPORT THEM BOTH. AND DATA CERTAINLY WERE WAITING TO SEE WHAT THE. REVENUE NUMBERS COME IN. PAY YOUR TAXES PEOPLE. YES SO WITH THAT LET'S GET TO SOME SOME DISCUSSION HERE I WANT TO START BY BY OUT TALKING TO OUR PRESIDENTS AND SO. I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND GOOD NICE TO NICE TO SEE YOU PRESIDENT. CASTRO I I THINK I REMEMBER YOU LIKE TWENTY YEARS AGO AND IS DOING THAT YOU SEE STUDENT SENATE PROGRAM I DO YOU REMEMBER THAT YES. IT IS I'M REMEMBER HAVE A BLAST BACK HERE SEPARATE THIS ISSUE NOW IS THAT YOU AS A CSU PRESIDENT THANK FIRST FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY SO I RAZA A NOMINAL FEE YOU. THANK YOU BUT I REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON ARE. NOT MY STAR WITNESS BUT HE'S MY A CONSTITUENT HERE AND HERE AT SAKS IDEA AND THAT. YOU KNOW IF WE COULD I THINK IF WE COULD JUST BOTTLED OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AYE AT THAT SEX STATE AND SOME OF THE OTHERS WE WE WOULD HAVE A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY HERE SO MAYBE PRESIDENT NELSON IF WE COULD. TALK FOR A FEW SECONDS ABOUT YOUR STORY AND AND DIFFERENT FROM THE DAY YOU GOT HERE THIS IS. A QUEST OF YOURS AND WE SEE BY THE STATISTICS THAT IT'S NOT. JUST A FEW STUDENTS IT'S ACROSS THE BOARD DEPEND COHORTS AS FAR AS THE ETHNICITY AND. AND BACKGROUND IF IT'S REALLY WORKING. AND SO ON YOU KNOW WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS STRUCK BY AND THEN YOU CUT TOLD ME IS YOU JUST SHOW THAT STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS WHEN THEY WHEN THEY DID THEIR ORIENTATION. JUST THAT SIMPLE MATHEMATICS OF. FIFTEEN PLUS FIFTEEN. EICHEL'S BECAUSE FIVE FOUR YEARS AND TWELVE PLUS TWELVE DOES NOT EQUALS THAT OF FIVE AND SO A FEW THINGS AND ONE. ON IT'S NOT JUST FIFTEEN OF COURSE THEY COULD DO THIRTY PER YEAR. AND SO I THOUGHT I I ASSUME THAT YOU FOCUS ON THEY COULDN'T SPECIFY THEIR FRESHMAN THEY COULD EVEN GO TO. SUMMER SCHOOL AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR FREE THERE IF THERE CALTRAIN ELIGIBLE THEIR NINE NINETY NINE PERCENT LIKELY. THE THAT THE FORMER BOB WHEREVER ELSE WAS THAT YOU DO THAT OR THEY CAN DO WINNER SESSION OR. OR GO TO A CSU THROUGH ON THEIR THEIR THEIR PAL FINANCIAL AID SO. SIT SO CAN YOU TELL US YOU KNOW HOW YOU ABLE TO. MOTIVATES AS. STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO REALLY GRASP THIS DECISION. WELL I THINK THE FIRST THING IS YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IN THE STUDENTS. AND I BELIEVE IN THAT SACRAMENTO STATE AND ALL OF CSU STUDENTS YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL AND THAT THEY CAN TAKE THE CREDITS. I THINK FOR A LONG TIME. WE. SAID WELL TAKE IT EASY AT THE FIRST OKAY TAKE TWELVE. PELL GRANT SAYS YOU ONLY HAVE TAKE TWELFTH PICK TWELFTH AND AND WILL EVENTUALLY MOVING FORWARD. WE'VE INSTEAD OF SAID TO THEM WE WANT YOU TO GRADUATE AS QUICKLY AS WE POSSIBLY CAN WE TURNED AWAY THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED STUDENTS THIS YEAR. THAT WERE FULLY QUALIFIED I WANT TO GET THOSE STUDENTS IN TO THE CLASSES BUT I'VE GOT TO MOVE THE OTHER STUDENTS OUT AT THE SAME TIME. AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE MY STUDENTS. LEAVING WITH DEBT SO WHEN WE HAVE ORIENTATION WE BROUGHT THE PARENTS TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME. AND I LOOKED AT THE PARENTS AND I SAID. IF CARLOS. MADISON. ONLY TAKE TWELVE CREDITS. IT'S GOING TO COST YOU AN EXTRA TWENTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST TUITION YOU GOTTA PAY FOR BOOKS YOU GOTTA PAY FOR FOOD YOU GOTTA PAY FOR HOUSING. YOU WANTED. IF YOU GOT AN EXTRA TWENTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN CHUMP CHANGE IN YOUR BACK POCKET. THE PARENTS ALL SAID NO AND I SAID WELL HAVE THEM SIGN. THIS PLEDGE THAT THEY'LL TAKE. THEY HOURS THAT TAKE FIFTEEN CREDITS. AND THE FIRST TIME SIXTY SIX PERCENT DID. THE NEXT TIME EIGHTY FOUR PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS THAT IT WHO AND I THINK THE REALLY TELLING NUMBER NOT EVERY STUDENTS GOING TO BE ABLE DO IT SOME STUDENTS. HAVE TO WORK EXTRA HOURS WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION ALL OF THOSE STUDENTS ARE YOU ARE YOU TELLING ABOUT THE THEY CAN DO. THIRTY BY GOING TO SUMMER SCHOOL WINNER LIKE I SHOULD BUY IT AND WE'VE INCREASED THE NUMBER WINNER SESSION. COURSES SPECIALLY IN A PROGRAM LIKE SOCIAL WORK WHERE WE NEED TO GET THEIR. PRACT HIM SOMEPLACE CS WERE TRYING TO DO IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH. AND. THEY ARE SUCCEEDING THE THE I THINK THE NUMBER THAT. A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDN'T BELIEVE WE WOULD REACH WAS THAT FIFTY PERCENT OF THE FRESHMAN. TOOK AND PASSED FIFTEEN CREDITS IN THEIR FIRST SEMESTER. FIFTY PERCENT YEAH. AND AS BEFORE AT MY NEXT QUESTION AND IT'S REALLY. NOT JUST THE TWENTY THREE THOUSAND IF YOU COULD SAY IT'S. YOU KNOW BETWEEN SIXTY AND SEVENTY THOUSAND BECAUSE THAT'S THAT FORTY THOUSAND ADVERTS SALARY FOR COLLEGE GRADUATE THEREFORE GOING BY HANGING AROUND THEIR FIFTH YEAR. THEN IF THEY IF MAYBE THEY'LL GET LUCKY AND GET A BEER G. WAIVER BUT THAT'S ONE LESS I'M NOT BE WOULD YOU EVER BECAUSE SAHGAL STRUGGLES OVER SAGA WORK BUT THAT'S ONE LESS AWARD YOU CAN GIVE. THE SOMEBODY ELSE AND SO. I YOU KNOW I I THINK THAT. THAT THIS IS A HUGE UP I KNOW WE HAVE A BILL WE'RE TALKING ON THE POLICY AS FAR AS WHAT CALIFORNIA DOES TO INCENTIVIZE WHETHER IT'S PALLOR CAL GRANT. STUDENTS TO TO TAKE THIRTY OVER AT THAT THAT THAT CAN'T CALENDAR YEAR NOT COUNTY WOULD YOU CALL AGAIN RYAN. COLLEGE YEAR. COLLEGE YEAR COLLEGE YEAR. I ALSO WANT TO ASK YOU I I THINK WE SPOKE ABOUT THIS IS WHEN A STEEP YOU CAN TALK ABOUT IT. THERE ARE A LOT OF STUDENTS WHO LOST THEIR CRAFT CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY. THAT. OF COURSE THEY WOULD HAVE TO BORROW MONEY OR MAYBEGET LACKEY AND GET A SAGA WORDS. OR ON YOU KNOW FIGURED OUT BUT THEY'RE QUITE A FEW WHO WHO RAN OUT A CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY. AND THEY PROBABLY DROPPED OUT RIGHT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SCHOOL AND SO CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT WE THINK AS FAR AS HOW MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE AND. MAYBE JUST IN THE SACRAMENTO REGION. ARE MAYBE WITHIN THIRTY UNITS OF A DEGREE BUT DON'T HAVE ANYMORE. CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY OR FINANCE LADLES BUILDING WE KNOW THAT IN THE SACRAMENTO REGION THERE SIXTY TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE. WHO ARE WITHIN FIFTEEN CREDITS OF GRADUATING? THEY NEVER GRADUATED. SO YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WHY. WELL FOR SOMEONE LIFE GOTTEN AWAY. FOR SOME OF THEM THEY GOT A BETTER JOB ON THE LONG THE WASTE FOR SOMEONE COLLEGE WASN'T RIGHT. THE FOR A VERY HIGH PERCENTAGE AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PERCENTAGES AND WERE TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT AS PART OF THE. AND INITIATIVE WITH LINE CAPITAL REGION RIGHT NOW BUT FOR A VERY HIGH PERCENTAGE THEY GOT TO THE FIFTH. TO THEIR FOURTH YEAR. AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE FUNDING IN THE FIFTH YEAR WITH THE CAL GRANT. AND THAT CAL GRANT MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD FOR THEM TO BE ABLE THAT THE COME. AND IF YOU CAN'T PAY FOR YOUR TUITION AND YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE YOUR DEBTS. YEAH ADDING UP YOU DROP OUT. AND SO THAT'S Y. WE WANT TO SEE EVERY STUDENT WE POSSIBLY CAN GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS. SO THAT THEY DON'T GET TO THAT PRECIPICE AND JUST SIMPLY GIVE UP SHARE. AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES AND EVERYONE'S DIFFERENT YOU'RE DIFFERENT OTHER PRESIDENTS JUST LIKE PERSONALITIES IN THE PLAN SO GET IT BE DIFFERENT BUT. WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK OF A COUPLE THINGS THAT WE COULD DO AS A STATE AND AND IT'S NOT JUST PICKING ON CSU THIS ISSUE THAT? AT THE UC LEVEL ON A COMMITTEE COLLEGE BUT CSU IS THE WORK COURSES FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS NEARLY THAT'S WHERE YOU SEE. I THINK THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IN IN THIS WITH WHAT THAT FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS WITH YOU SEE. YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT TYPE OF OP HE IN MANY TAKEN ME ASKING OTHER IN ANOTHER WAY IS THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT THE COMPACT THAT STUDENTS SIGN. I'M REALLY INTRIGUED BY DON'T THINK THIS MESS SIMPLISTIC TERMS FOR US PEOPLE WHO GET A CREDIT CARD. YOU BUY NEW TV AT. SOUND SYSTEM AT BEST BUY YOU GET A THING IN THE MAIL FOR. FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ITS AS YOUR MINIMUM PAYMENT IS. FIFTY BUCKS BUT HE PAY THIS. IT'S GONNA TAKE YOU LIKE THIRTY YEARS THAT YOU'LL END UP PAYING. THIRTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS NOT A FEW THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR YOUR PURCHASE AND. AND SO THAT KIND IT. GETS PEOPLE'S ATTENTION SO. IS THIS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING WITH INCOMING CSU STUDENTS AND HAVE THEM. YOU KNOW LOOK AT THAT THAT WHETHER IT'S A COMPACT A SIGN BUT YOU KNOW INFORMED CONSENT YOU KNOW MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND. THE IMPLICATIONS OF. TWELVE TAKING IT EASY VERSES FIFTEENTHS AS A SEMESTER THIRTY THROUGH THE YEAR AND GOING BAY AND WHAT THAT ACTUALLY. MEANS SO THAT FAMILY. I THINK FINANCIAL LITERACY IS A CREDIBLY IMPORTANT. AND MAKING CERTAIN THAT STUDENTS UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A COST TO WHAT'S HAPPENING AND IT'S A COST THAT WILL GO WITH THEM THE REST THEIR LIVES. WHEN OUR STUDENTS GOING TO MY E. D. YOU AND THEY LOOK AT THEIR DEGREE PLAN THEY ACTUALLY SEE HOW MUCH DEBT THEY'RE RUNNING AT THIS POINT HOW MUCH. PELL GRANT THEY HAVE LEFT HOW MUCH THEY'VE TAKEN OUT IN LOANS SO THAT THE PHYSICALLY KNOW THAT FOR AND WE NEED TO REMIND THEM EVERY. DAY THAT THIS IS COSTING YOU SOMETHING. LET'S MAKE THE MOST OF IT. WE HAVE A SLIDING SCALE IN QUESTION. YOU CAN TAKE AS MANY HOURS AS YOU WANT ABOVE THE SIX AND CREDITS AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY MORE IT'S NOT THAT YOU'RE PAYING FOR EVERY CREDIT SO. THERE'S THAT INCENTIVE TO TAKE ALL THE CREDIT YOU CAN WE NEED TO MAKE IT EASY FOR THEM TO HAVE THEM AND WE NEED TO NEED TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THEY KNOW WHAT COURSES ARE GONNA COUNT TOWARDS YOUR DEGREE. THAT'S WHY SMART PLANNER IS SO IMPORTANT TO US YET. AND AND YOU'RE AND YOU'RE AT THE PLATE THE PITCHER YOU'RE MAKING IS THE ONE SEVENTY ONE AND YOU'RE SAYING THAT. IT WITHOUT THAT YOU'D HAVE TO MAKE. TOP DECISIONS CAMPUS WIDE PLUS THIS PROGRAMS THAT WOULD BE IN JEOPARDY AND HOW ARE YOU. MAKING IT WORK THE LAST FEW YEARS TO DO THAT. THE. THAT THAT THE GRANTS FOR SUMMER SESSION. THE. THE OTHER EFFORTS THAT THAT THAT YOU'RE DOING. HOW ARE YOU ABLE TO? A FINANCE THAT I ROB PETER TO PAY PAUL. AND EVERY TIME I COULD POSSIBLY DO THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IN OUR CAMPUS IS TO PROVIDE THE COURSES FOR OUR STUDENTS. SO A BUSINESS AFFAIRS ALONE GAVE ONE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR FROM ITS BUDGET THAT IT WAS GOING TO USE FOR IN FIRST. TO BE ABLE THAT AUGMENT SO THAT WE COULD HAVE THE ADDITIONAL COURSES. STUDENT AFFAIRS THIS WEEK GAVE THREE HUNDRED FORTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ITS BUDGET AND TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE ADDED EXTRA CLASSES SO OUR EMPHASIS IS BEEN ON GETTING THOSE CLASSES. OUR STUDENTS USE TO HAVE TO CRASH COURSES AND THEY WOULD STAY AND WAIT FOR A SEAT TO OPEN UP AND THEN THEY. JUMP IN THAT SEAT AND TRY TO GET THE FACULTY MEMBER SIGN IN MAN. FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT. HOWEVER IF THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE IS NOT FUNDED. WE'RE GONNA LOSE SEVEN HUNDRED COURSES. AND HAVE YOUR HAS HAS HAVE THE STUDENTS IN. SEE IF EIGHT AFFILIATE OF THEY FULLY EMBRACED. THAT THEIR REDIRECTION OF ROBBING PETER TO PAY PAUL THAT MAKE THIS A REALITY. I BELIEVE THE STUDENTS HAVE AN AND KNOW THAT THE FACULTY HAVE THE FACT WE'VE GONE OUT OF THEIR WAY I HAVE OUTSTANDING FACULTY. AT. CAL STATE. SACRAMENTO THEY THEY CARE. THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN THEY'VE INCREASE THE SIZE OF THEIR CLASSES TO BE ABLE TO DO IT. AND THEY'RE TEACHING AT. ODD HOURS I HAVE A CLASS NOW ON SUNDAY ON FRIDAY AND SUNDAY IN ENGINEERING. BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THE LAB WAS OPEN. THE EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD PRESIDENT GESTURE ABOUT. WHAT WHAT ARE THAT? TOP SPECIFIC THINGS THAT YOU KNOW. WE COULD BE DOING TO TO. NOT JUST THAT FRESNO STATE BUT SEATTLE Y. AYE I THINK PRESIDENT NELSON CAPTURED IT RIGHT. WHAT WERE? UNDER GOING NOW IS A CULTURAL CHANGE WITHIN OUR SYSTEM AND. THAT ACCESS ALONE IS INSUFFICIENT SO THAT ACCESS AND SUCCESS TOGETHER. AND WAKING UP EVERY MORNING TRYING TO DO BETTER AND BETTER AT SERVING OUR STUDENTS AND. TWEAKING OUR POLICIES INVESTING IN THE PROGRAMS THAT WE KNOW ARE WORKING. STOPPING THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE NOT WORKING BUT THIS GRADUATION INITIATIVE FUNDING HAS BEEN. CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS AND WERE ALL MAKING DIFFICULT DECISIONS ALREADY BECAUSE OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER CHALLENGES. BUT THE FOCUS IS ON MAKING SURE THAT OUR STUDENTS SUCCEED THAT THERE ARE NO ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AND. AND I DO AGREE WITH PRESIDENT NELSON IT STARTS OF BELIEVING IN THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES AND BECAUSE SO MANY OF OUR STUDENTS ARE FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE. IT'S PROVIDING THAT EXTRA SUPPORT TO HELP THEM NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM. BECAUSE YOU CAN'T ASSUME. THAT THEY KNOW HOW TO DO THAT WHEN THEY ARRIVE AND IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR US AND I SERVE A LOT OF FARM WORKER KIDS. AND THEY ARE SO SMART. HALL OF OUR STUDENTS ARE VERY VERY SMART. BUT IF THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE STRUCTURE. THEN THE SIMPLE OFFERED ADMISSION IS IS NOT A COMPLETE OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE THE SUPPORT PROGRAMS IN PLACE FOR THEM. SO THAT THEY CAN SUCCEED AND WERE SAYING THIS ACROSS EACH OF THE CAMPUSES AND. I I'M CONFIDENT THAT AS A SYSTEM WITH YOUR SUPPORT WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE. TO ACHIEVE THESE BIG AMPLE GOALS THAT WE HAVE. OKAY. THE STRATEGY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS. I BELIEVE ALL OF US ARE. ENCOURAGED TO SEE THE. THE INCREASING GRADUATION RATES THE. THE F.SIS ARE GREATER ACCESS HOME. AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT. THAT GREATER ACCESS. REQUIRES ADDITIONAL FUNDING. PA MY MAIN CONCERN IS THAT. YOUR REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING GO TO THOSE GOALS OF ACCESS AND. SUPPORTING THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE. AND. NOT. TO. OR IT DID TO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE WATCHING THE. SIGNIFICANT GROWTH AND MANAGEMENT. COMPENSATION. THAT THE STATE AUDITOR FOUND IN THEIR APRIL TWENTY SEVENTEEN STATE AUDIT. WANTED TO. REMINDS. MY COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMITTEE AS WELL AS SAID THOSE IN THE AUDIENCE SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE. STATE AUDIT. FINDINGS WHICH INCLUDED THE CSU SIGNIFICANT GROWTH. IN MANAGEMENT POSITIONS THE AMOUNT BEING PAID TO COMPENSATE EXECUTIVES AND THE LACK OF OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF CAMPUS BUDGETS. AS FOUND. IN THE WORDS OF THE STATE AUDITOR. THAT. FROM TWENTY TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. CSU MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISORY POSITIONS GREW MORE THAN DOUBLE THE GROWTH RATE OF. SERIOUS YOU SUPPORT STAFF. THAT. LED THE STATE OUGHT TO CONCLUDE THAT THE CSU CAMPUSES COULD NOT ADEQUATELY JUSTIFY THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL AND THEIR COMPENSATION. AND THAT AGAIN THE STATE AUDITOR FINDING. THAT THE CSU CAMPUSES DO NOT ADEQUATELY OVERSEE THEIR BUDGETS. WHICH REDUCE ASSURANCES THAT STATE FUNDS ARE BEING SPENT. EFFICIENTLY AND APPROPRIATELY AND DESPOTS TYPICALLY OF FAR CONCERNS. TO SUPPORT THE GOALS OF ACCESS IN THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE SO. COULD YOU ALL. SOMEHOW REASSURE US THAT YOUR REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING ARE GOING TO BENEFIT THE STUDENTS. IN TERMS OF ACCESS AND GRADUATION INITIATIVE. AND NOT JUST TO INCREASE THE RANKS OF. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. MAY I. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ASSURE YOU OF THAT. AS I SAID WE PUT SEVEN POINT TWO SIX MILLION. DOLLARS INTO ADDITIONAL COURSES THAT MONEY WAS THE MONEY FROM THE GRADUATION. WE HARD SEVEN ADDITIONAL ADVISORS THAT WAS MONEY FROM THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE. WE. CREATED THE GREAT. I GRADUATION ECOSYSTEM WITH SMART PLANNER. THAT. TELLS EVERYONE OF THE STUDENTS EXACTLY WHAT CLASSES THEY HAVE TO HAVE AND UNDERNEATH THAT IT'S PLATINUM ANALYTICS WHICH TELLS THE DEANS EXACTLY HOW MUCH WHAT CLASSES THEY NEED TO PUT ON NEXT SEMESTER. SO THAT THEY ARE TAKING THE EXTRA HOURS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HERE THE EXTRA CREDITS WE PUT THAT THERE. I AM COMMITTED TO THE STUDENTS. I KNOW THAT EVERYONE OF THE TWENTY THREE. CAMPUSES ID EVERYONE OF THE TWENTY THREE PRESIDENTS AND OUR CHANCELLOR ARE COMMITTED TO THE STUDENTS AND WE WILL SERVE THOSE STUDENTS. AND MAKE SURE THAT THE COURSES ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE. AND I DO WATCH MY BUT BUDGET LIKE A HAWK. I. I APPRECIATE THAT HOWEVER. LOOKING AT YOUR. SYSTEM MY CSU BUDGET REQUEST. OF COURSE THE LARGEST DIPLOCK. IS IS FOR THE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS AND. THEY ARE. THE. ADDITIONAL CSU BUDGET REQUEST. ARE GOING TOWARD COMPENSATION WHICH. WE CAN UNDERSTAND GIVEN THAT THE STAFF ANALYSIS THAT WAS PROVIDED TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THE HIGHLIGHT THAT ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OF CS USE CORE OPERATIONAL BUDGET GOES TO. EMPLOYEE COSTS. BUT. A AGAIN ME JUST FROM MY BUT I AM SURE YOU CAN. HIGHLIGHT SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF HOW THE DOLLARS ARE BEING WELL SPENT BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE OVERALL PICTURE IT DOES APPEAR THAT THE LARGEST BLOCK IS GOING TOWARD COMPENSATION. AND THAT COMBINE WITH STATE AUDITOR'S FINDINGS THAT. THE MANAGEMENT A SUPERVISOR POSITIONS MOE THAN DOUBLED. FROM. SEVEN TO SIXTEEN IT DOES RAISE CONCERN. I ADDS TO THE OVERALL PICTURE AND HELP WHETHER THOSE DOLLARS ARE BEING PRIORITIZE FOR ACCESS AND THE GRADUATION IN. ANY RESPONSE FROM THE SYSTEM WIDER PERSPECTIVE RIGHT BE HAPPY TO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE REPORT THAT WE HAD. DELIVERED IN JANUARY ABOUT A PROGRESS UPDATE ON HOW WE SPENT THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR THAT WOULD DEDICATE OR THE TOWARD THE GRAD INITIATIVE. BUT IN THERE YOU WILL SEE EXPLICITLY OUR GOALS NUMBER ONE AT THE TOP OF THE LIST. INCONSISTENT WITH THE PRESIDENT'S TESTIMONY WAS THE PROVISION OF ADDITIONAL COURSE SECTIONS. WE PROVIDED AT BOTH IN THE SIX MONTHS THAT THAT STARTED FOR THE ACADEMIC YEAR THROUGH JANUARY. AND PROJECTED TO THIS YEAR AN ADDITIONAL OVER THREE THOUSAND ADDITIONAL COURSE SECTIONS THROUGHOUT THE CSU. ALSO IN TERMS OF SERVICING THOSE COURSE SECTIONS WE HIRED AN ADDITIONAL OF. FOUR HUNDRED WITH PROJECTIONS TENURE TRACK FACULTY POSITIONS. BUT WHAT WE HAVE TO BE REALLY CLEAR ABOUT THIS YES A LOT OF THE COST DURING COMPENSATION. THESE ARE TENURE TRACK FACULTY POSITIONS THAT ARE NET NEW. THAT ARE ABOVE AND BEYOND WHERE WE WERE IN THE LAST YEAR SO THROUGHOUT TODAY'S PANEL AND I THINK YOU'LL HEAR IT THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND EVEN THERE ARE PLENTY OF STUDENTS IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM. IF YOU ASK ANY OF US WHAT ONE OF OUR TOP PRIORITY IS ABOVE ALL IT IS ENSURING THAT OUR STUDENTS GET THE CLASSES THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED THEM. BUT DOING THAT TO BE FRANK TAKES TIME. TAKES TIME TO HIRE THE FACULTY MEMBERS TAKES A COMMITMENT TO HIRING A TENURE TRACK FACULTY TO PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT. I'VE FROM OF THAT SYSTEM PERSPECTIVE AGAIN REAL QUICK SO I WANTED TO ADDRESS YOUR YOUR YOUR COMMENT ABOUT THE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS SO. LIKE IN MY OPENING COMMENTS AND MENTION THAT WE HAVE ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES TO RAISE COMPENSATION FOR ALL OF THOSE EMPLOYEES BY ONE PERCENT. ENDS UP BEING A LITTLE OVER FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. SO WHAT YOU SEEN IN TERMS OF THE REQUEST YOU SEE AN INCREASE OF ABOUT ON AVERAGE THREE PERCENT. OF THAT POOL ABOUT HALF OF THAT MONEY GOES TO SUPPORT OUR FACULTY. SO THEY RECEIVED ABOUT A THREE PERCENT INCREASE IN THAT IT'S ABOUT HALF THE COST. AND ABOUT A QUARTER OF THAT ADDITIONAL COST IS TO SUPPORT. OUR STAFF UNITS. AND THEN THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER UNITS INVOLVED THERE TOO AS WELL AS I'M WHAT ARE THE MPS. GENERALLY SPEAKING OVER A TEN YEAR PERIOD WE HAVE. HAVE BEEN ON PACE WITH INFLATION IN TERMS OF SALARY INCREASES FOR OUR EMPLOYEES. SO DURING THE GREAT RECESSION WE HAD FIVE YEARS OF THAT NO INCREASES AT ALL AND IN FACT WE HAD FURLOUGHS JUST LIKE STATE EMPLOYEES DID. AND THEN NOW IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM YOU FOLKS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO INCREASE COMPENSATION. FOR ALL EMPLOYEES I GENERALLY SPEAKING THOUGH I'M IN TERMS OF YOUR CONCERN ABOUT. COSTS GOING UP FOR EXECUTIVES IN MP PEACE IN THOSE SORTS OF THINGS. GENERALLY SPEAKING ARE UNITS HAVE RECEIVED ACTUALLY MORE OF A COMPENSATION INCREASINGLY ISRAEL'S NEGOTIATIONS AND THOSE WHO ARE NON REPRESENTED SO I JUST WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT. BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING YOU I'M ONE OF THINGS THAT AND IT MIGHT THAT MY INITIAL POINTS I WANTED TO POINT OUT WAS THAT. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT YOU KNOW PRESIDENT CASTRO IMPRISONED NELSON CAN RETAIN THESE FOLKS YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM. A SYSTEMATIC AND YEAH INCREASES TO THEIR COMPENSATION OVER TIME ESPECIALLY WHEN HE HAD FIVE% YEARS OF A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL DROUGHT SO. WE JUST WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO BALANCE A LOT OF ITEMS HERE. ALL OF THE SPIES COMPONENTS THAT YOU SEE ON THAT LIST ARE REALLY KIND OF THE MEAT POTATOES OF THE UNIVERSITY GOING FORWARD. AND WITH A GREAT INITIATIVE DOES IS ALLOWS US TO ADD INCREMENTALLY MORE FACULTY AND AND KEY STAFF TO THOSE PIECES. SO THAT THEY CAN COME BACK EACH AND EVERY YEAR AND SAY OUR GRADUATION RATES ROTH OFF THE HOOK SO TO SPEAK. BUTTON THANK YOU. IN THIS CHAIR I I'D JUST LIKE TO CONCLUDE MY. MY A QUESTIONS BY. JUST EMPHASIZING THAT SO AGAIN WHY WE DO APPRECIATE THE. OPTIMISTIC SIGNALS THAT CSU IS HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IN TERMS OF. ACCESS IN IN IN IN TERMS OF INCREASING THE GRADUATION RATES. THAT THAT WE WANT TO AGAIN MAKE SURE THAT THE DOLLARS ARE BEING WELL SPENT. TOWARD THOSE GOALS AND. NOT NOT ON SOME OF THESE SHORTCOMINGS AT LEAST IDENTIFIED BY THE STATE AUDITOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAVIS. WELL I THINK IT'S VERY TOPICAL OR HAVE THE DISCUSSION YOU KNOW THERE'S. WALK OUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN DIFFERENT STATES. BECAUSE OF EDUCATION NOT BEING FUNDED. AND THAT IT IS A TRAGEDY HERE THE DISCUSSION BECAUSE WE'RE HAVING RIGHT NOW IS. IS IT JOB AND THERE'S A STRICTLY THE. THE TEACHERS AND PROFESSORS COSTS OR DID THE INFRASTRUCTURE COST IT'S SOMEWHAT LISTEN DO I GUESS SOME THE STATE'S DECIDE TO GIVE THE TEACHERS THE REYES WOULD WANT INVEST. AND THE. INFRASTRUCTURE. I DON'T THINK. I TAKE IN. FROM PETER TO PAY PAUL IS A SOLUTION. THAT'S NOT JUST KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE STREET AND IS GOING TO CAUSE PROBLEMS WHEN I HEARD. HAS PRESENT NELSON TAKI WAS TALKING ABOUT. WHAT TOOK SO MUCH MONEY OUT OF HIS INFRASTRUCTURE TO GIVE TO THE OPERATIONAL COST? YOU MAY BE ABLE DO THAT FOR ONE YEAR MAYBE TWO YEARS BUT THAT'S GOING TO BE A RECIPE FOR A PROBLEM LATER ON THAT'S. IN BE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE. SO. I WANT TO BE CLEAR. THAT I AM STE. ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SUPPORTIVE INCREASE IN FUNDING FOR THE C. ISSUES. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER. IN AS I MENTIONED TO THE GOVERNOR'S PEOPLE. BUT I DO WANT US TO CONTINUE ON THIS TRACK WE START FOR SIX YEARS NOW MISTER EVANS NATHAN EVANS YOU PRESENT DISH. JEFF COHEN DESSERTS. I READ GRASSO LOCKED. IN THIS THING STARTS THAT COHORT ENTRY YEAR. OF. TWENTY TWELVE IT LOOKS LIKE THE ONE ABOVE IS LIKE TWENTY TEN. AND THEN THERE'S NOTHING ELSE AFTER SIDE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHEN MY READINGS IS ONLY GOT HERS IS TWENTY TWELVE AND WE'VE BEEN FUNDING THIS THING. IN THE LAST THREE YEARS FIFTY SIX YOU KNOW WHAT DOES THIS TELL ME BESIDES NOTHING YEAH SO I CAN PROVIDE YOU THE DATA TABLES BEHIND IT SEE. THE THE ACTUAL POINTS THE MAJOR POINT HERE IS TO SEE. AND WHERE WE HAVE BEEN ON GRADUATION RATES THE TWENTY TWELVE IS THE ENTERING YEAR FOR THOSE FRESHMEN. SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS YOU CAME TO ONE OF OUR CSU CAMPUS CAMPUSES IN THE YEAR TWENTY TWELVE WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU FOUR YEARS LATER FIVE YEARS LATER SIX YEARS LATER SO IN THE CASE OF. THIS TWENTY THREE PERCENT TWENTY THREE PERCENT OF THOSE STUDENTS WHO CAME TO US IN TWENTY TWELVE AS FRESHMEN ALL ACROSS THE STATE. GRADUATED IN FOUR YEARS OR LESS FIFTY PERCENT OF THAT POPULATION GRADUATED YEAH SIX YEARS ABOUT CB FIVE YEARS OR LESS ED. FIFTY NINE PERCENT IT SIX USER LESSON YOU CAN SEETHAT THE LINES GO BACK A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE IT GOES BACK IN TIME. THAT THE FIFTY PERCENT FROM TWENTY ELEVEN AND THAT FIFTY NINE FOR TWENTY TEN. SO THIS THIS CRAFT YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S NOT SCIENTIFIC THAT'S NOT MEANT FOR YOU TO PINPOINT EVERY YEAR I CAN PROVIDE THAT DATA. THAT THE GOAL IS TO SHOW THE TRAJECTORY WHICH WAS FAIRLY INCREMENTAL FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS HAS REALLY SKYROCKETED UP WITH OUR INTENTIONALITY. WHAT WAS PROPERTIES I GUESS SPEAK MORE TO IT A CONVERSATION WE HAD LAST PANEL WE TALKED ABOUT? THE SOCIETY'S NEEDS FOR EDUCATION FOR ECONOMIC REASONS OVER TWENTY FIVE YEAR PERIOD TIME BUT. I DON'T SEE REALLY MEETS MUCH OF. WHEN OUR INVESTMENT HAS BLESSED IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE SHOW ME LOVE TO SEE A HAVE TO SAY THE OKAY YEAH YEAH. THE COMMENTS MADE EARLIER BY FROM THE DYESS ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF COST GOING FOR EMPLOYEES. EVERY BACK MY OTHER JOB THEY USED TO DO. RUNNING BIG ORGANIZATIONS IT WAS. EVERY A BUSINESS ACTIVITY LOOK AT AND FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW IS IS IT THEY MATERIAL CAUSES IT TO AND YOU GUYS. IN EDUCATION IT'S. PERSONAL COST BECAUSE YOU GET PEOPLE TO EACH OTHER PEOPLE AND THAT'S A BAD THING. SO. I'M UP MY COMMENT IS A EIGHTY PERCENT DOESN'T SCARE ME. I THINK IT'S PROBABLY APPROPRIATE I ALSO DON'T BELIEVE TONE SOMEBODY HAD A SECOND EGG. AND SO. IF YOU'VE. WE HIRE YOU TO RUN GREAT SCHOOLS AND BARELY SEMI NUMBERS AGO. NOW TO FRESNO YOU HAVE HILL CHART TO. I DIDN'T BRING SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT I CAN GET YOU SOMEONE THAT WOULD BE GREAT TO SEE BECAUSE YOU'RE FAT. YOU KNOW YOU MADE A LOT OF NICE WORDS BUT I'M MORE INTERESTED IN THE NUMBERS SHADOW. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT FONG GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THE NUMBERS SO WHEN I STARTED IS PRESIDENT OUR GRADUATION RATE WAS FORTY EIGHT PERCENT AND NOW IT'S GETTING CLOSE TO SIXTY PERCENT. OUR GOAL IS TO GET IT TO SEVENTY PERCENT THAT'S IN SIX YEARS OR EIGHT SIX YEAR REIGN. RICHARDSON ARE TRANSFER RATE HAS GONE UP. SIGNIFICANTLY AS WELL THAT I'LL BE HAPPY TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU SETTLEMENT CHARGES SO YOUR SIX YEAR RATE. FOR FRESHMEN COMING IN. IS WHAT IS IS NEARING SIXTY PERCENT NOW CHAU YOUR ABOVE. WERE ABOUT THAT WERE ABOUT THIS YOUR AVERAGE THERE YEAH ROUGHLY THE STATE'S A FIFTY NINE SO YEAR I ABOUT THIS ABOUT THAT AVERAGE AND. OUR GOAL THOUGH IS TO GET TO SEVENTY AND THIS GRADUATION INITIATIVE WILL HELP US TO DO THAT OVER TIME. HER GOAL IS TO GET THERE BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. SO WHEN I LOOK AT THE REPORT THAT WE HAVE ON PAGE EIGHT. FROM THE. I GUESS SHE LA JOH. THE. AND TWENTY FIFTEEN TO FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE WAS NINETEEN PERCENT. TWENTY SEVENTEEN IS TWENTY THREE PERCENT FOR INCREASE OF FOUR. WE'RE ANTICIPATING A GOAL A TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AT FORTY SO IF WE INCREASE THE. FLAG SLOW BUT FOUR PERCENT FOR THE NEXT YEAR FOR SEQUENCES. IT SHOWS WE GET TO THIRTY NINE PERCENT IS THAT MY READING THAT RIGHT. DE LA OR WHOEVER PUT THIS REPORT TOGETHER. I'M PAGE. EIGHT. WHICH I HAVE ANNOUNCES I GUESS IS STAFF ANALYSIS IS GENDER. ON PAGE EIGHT. AGENDA THEIR GENDER. SO ONE SHOWN IT'S GONNA GET TO THIRTY NINE PERCENT THE. FRESHMAN SIX YOUR GRADUATE WAS FIFTY SEVEN. THEN TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN WILL GET TO FIFTY NINE. PERCENT AND SEVENTEEN I WAS A TWO PERCENT UP. IF YOU CONTINUE THE GLIDE SLOPE. WE GET TO SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT WHICH SHOWS THAT WE NEVER MEET OUR GOAL OF SEVENTY PERCENT. YEAH RIGHT. YES SHOW ME WHERE YOUR LOOKS AT THE TABLE THE BOTTOM HERE WHICH IS AT PAGE EIGHT YEAH ON THE US OF FOR WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW WITH TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHERE WE'RE HEADED. PROJECT THREES THAT WE HAVE WILL TAKE US TO THE GOALS THAT YOU SEE PRESENTED THEIR. SO. THESE GROUPS GET AHEAD SO WE DON'T MAKE UP. NOT SO THAT THE BOOK ARE YOU LOOKING AT THE TABLE OF OF A FRESHMAN I'M LOOKING AT PAGE EIGHT. UNDER SUBCOMMITTEE NEED NUMBER TWO EDUCATION FINANCE OF APRIL THIRD. THE DOW THE UNDER BACKGROUND GLOWED GRAPH IN THE BOTTOM SAYS SHE ISSUED PROVIDE INFORMATION INDICATING GRADUATES BEGAN TO RISE ALTHOUGH SHE MAY GAPS AND WIDE. THE CHART BELOW SHOWS TO FIFTEEN SYSTEM MY GRADUATION RATES TWENTY SEVENTEEN RATES AND THE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE GOALS. AND UNDER FORT UNDER FRESHMAN FOR pYOUR GRADUATION RATE IS NINETEEN PERCENT TWENTY FIFTEEN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN IS TWENTY THREE PERCENT WHICH INCREASE OF FOUR. AND IF YOU CONTINUE THE GLIDE SLOPE UP YOU'LL GET TO A. RATE OF THIRTY NINE PERCENT WHICH IS NOT YOUR GOAL OF FORTY WELL I SEE WE'RE SIX ANOTHER TO KEEP DRAW LINEAR TRAJECTORY FROM THE PROGRESS WE'VE HAD OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS OUT. WILL AND SO THAT'S THAT'S A GOOD POINT WHAT WITH THE GRAD INITIATIVE THERE IS CONSIDERABLE RAMP UP TIME SO WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW YOU ARE GOING TO SEE. INCREASED IMPROVEMENT IN THE OUT YEARS WHAT YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT TALK ABOUT IS THE COMPLETION GRANTS THAT HAPPENED TOWARDS THE END THAT HAVE HAPPENED BEFORE. THOSE START TO KICK IN BUT NEW. FRESHMEN THAT ARE COMING IN RIGHT NOW WE'RE GETTING A BRAND NEW FRESHMAN FIRST YEAR EXPERIENCE ARE BEING. THEY'RE EXPERIENCING FOR THE FIRST TIME A CAMPUS THAT'S WELCOMING OF THEM. WHEN THEY COME AND IN NEED OF ACTUAL PREPARATION IT'S ALL THESE THINGS YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SEE A LINEAR PATH IT'S GONNA TAKE US TO THIRTY NINE YOU'RE GONNA SEE A PATH. THAT'S GONNA DOT THAT'S GOING TO BE JUST WHAT YOU SEE GREATER GREAT AND THAT'S RIGHT. AND IF I CAN ADD IN THE TO SO. IT IN THIS CURRENT YEAR AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THIS WAS THE FIRST YEAR THAT WE WERE ABLE TO INVEST SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE GRAD INITIATIVE. OUR PLAN IS OVER THE NEXT THAN FIVE YEARS TO ADD SEVENTY FIVE MILLION MORE RECURRING TO EACH OF THOSE YEARS. SO YOU ALREADY HAVE A LOT OF GREAT SUCCESS THE CAMPUSES RABAL TO ACHIEVE STARTING WITH OUR GREAT INITIATIVE EFFORTS BACK STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND NINE. AND YOU SEE THE MANIFESTATION OF THAT. ENOUGH TWENTY FIFTEEN NUMBER THERE OKAY. AS WE WRAP UP WE HAVE. CURRENT YOUR MONEY AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO YOU SOME MONEY EVEN BEFORE THAT FOR GRADUATION A SHIP AS WE PARK A LOT OF THAT MONEY. IN THE NEXT HANDFUL OF YEARS THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL. BECAUSE EVERY TIME. PRESIDENT NELSON PRISON CASTERLY THE PRESENCE BRING IN NEW STUDENTS THEY'RE TELLING THAT NEW COHORT OF STUDENTS TAKE FIFTEEN. YOU CAN'T JUST LIVE OFF OF THE SEVEN AFTER THAT CITY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WE INVESTED THE SHAFT I GET I GET IT BUT YOU KNOW I MEAN IT'S IT WAS AND WHAT I DO HAVE READING MORE AND MORE QUESTIONS BUSINESS WERE MA'AM WHICH A PROJECTION IS GOING TO GET. TO. IS A BUT HE SAID IT'S GONNA BE HARD TO FORBES AND GREAT WHICH IT GONNA BE WHAT YOU THINK IS GOING TO BE. IF YOU HAVE A PLAN WHAT WE THINK A FORTY I MEAN THAT'S WHAT WE THINK WE'RE GONNA BE WE NEED YOU TO NOT MUCH HIGHER THAN. WHAT WHAT WERE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MOVE IS NOT I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND YOUR LOT? YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS RIGHT YOU SHOULDN'T TELL ME A LOT OF WORDS AND I'M LOOKING AT THIS AND I'M SAYING IF YOU CONTINUE WHAT YOU'RE DOING. HAVE IN DOING TO GOING ABOUT FOUR PERCENT THEN YOU SAY WELL WILLING WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO FOUR PERCENT WERE GOOD ALL YOU NEED THINGS FOR TO GO MUCH HIGHER THAN I DID GREAT. WHAT NUMBERS ARE GOING TO BE NEAR GO ON ABOUT ONE POINT? THAT IS SO THAT TO ME LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY'S TELL ME A STORY ALL I THINK THAT I THINK THE DIFFICULTY IN UNDER IN THIS IS THAT WHEN YOU. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STARTING YEARS FOR EXAMPLE YOU LOOK AT HOW WE SET THAT. SET REALISTIC GOALS BASED ON NOT ONLY WHERE OUR APPEARANCE IT SINCE ARE TODAY. WHAT WHERE THEY WILL BE IN THE FUTURE THAT'S HOW WE GOT TO THE FORTY PERCENT FOR? IN BETWEEN THAT WHAT HAPPENS WITH COHORTS ARE GROUP'S AS RYAN WAS MENTIONING THAT ARE STILL AND. THAT'S ARE ANY KIND OF BAKED AND SO WHETHER IT'S FOUR PERCENT NOW OUR THREE PERCENT NOW IS NOT INDICATIVE NECESSARILY OF WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE ART OUR TRAJECTORY TAKES US TO FORTY PERCENT. WE BELIEVE THAT'S VERY REASONABLE AN AMBITIOUS COMPARED TO OUR PEERS WE MAY BE A LITTLE BIT NORTH OF ARAB CERTAINLY HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL BE. BUT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TARGETING ALL RIGHT NOW. NOW WHEN I LOOK AT US SACRAMENTO STATE AND I'M REALLY ONLY SAY THIS FIRST WALKS I LIKE SOME THE NUMBER YOU'D LOOKED AT. FOR YOU SHE MAY GET PROGRESS I THINK THOSE ARE VERY IMPRESSIVE SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR DOING THAT. BUT I ALSO SO THAT'S A POSITIVE NAY WITHOUT LET'S LOOK AT THE. THE FIRST TIME FRESHMEN GRADUATION RATE FOR YEARS AND TWENTY FIFTEEN YOUR EIGHT POINT EIGHT WITH THE STATE. WAS AT NINETEEN. IS THAT I MIGHT COMPARING APPLES TO APPLES THERE ON THAT ONE THAT'S TRUE. OKAY SO AND NOW YOU UGANDA TO TWELVE. WHERE THE STATE'S GONNA TO TWENTY THREE? AND THAT'S SO YOU HAVE A THREE POINT TWO. IMPROVE AND HE HAS A. STATE'S GOING TO BEG FOR A HIGHER RATE THAN YOU ARE. FROM A MANAGEMENT STANDPOINT AT THE CSU SYSTEM. OBVIOUSLY SOME PEOPLE MUST BE TO REALLY GOOD BECAUSE I SOME PEOPLE ARE SO GOOD SO ARE YOU MANAGING THIS. SYSTEM WIDE OR YOU HAVE INDIVIDUAL GOALS BY INSTITUTION. YEAH SO WE HAVE A SYSTEMLIKE COLDS THAT YOU LOOK AT HERE IN EACH ONE OF OUR CAMPUS IT'S HAS. PICK CAMPUS SCHOOLS SO THAT SLIDE I SHOWED WITH SADDAM STATE BUT THEY'RE MATURE GROUP. THAT THAT HELP TO ESTABLISH SIX SCHOOLS BACK CAMPUS SO WOULD YOU GO FOR SEGMENT RIGHT. IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. I WOULD HAVE TO I SHOULD KNOW ENOUGH TALK MY HEAD. BUT I DON'T. SO. YOU NOW BACK IN MARIN COACHES SAY IF WE DON'T HAVE ESTABLISH HOLDING YOU DON'T HAVE AN IT THIRTY. OURS ARE JUST THIRTY PERCENT THIRTY PERCENT. WE'VE BEEN A BAND AND IT'S A SHAME AND THAT WHICH. ASSEMBLYMAN MCCARTY WE'RE HERE. BECAUSE HE ALLUDED TO IT WHEN I CAME TO SEX STATE THREE YEARS AGO. WE. VERY VOCALLY SAID FOR THIRTY YEARS WE'VE BEEN AT EIGHT PERCENT AND. WE HAVE TO CHANGE THAT. WE DID THIS YEAR THIRTY SIX POINT TWO PERCENT INCREASE. IN OUR GRADUATION RATE WE EXPECT TO DO THE SAME THING NEXT YEAR. AND WHAT WE EXPECTED RAMPANT UP EACH AND EVERY YEAR. WE GOT A LONG WAYS TO GO BUT WE CAN DO IT. AND THIRTY PERCENT THAT THE REASON I DON'T EVEN MENTION IT. IS BECAUSE THAT'S NOT MY PERSONAL DOT. I WANT TO BE AS GOOD AS. OR BETTER THAN ANY OTHER CSU. SIR I REALLY APPRECIATE WE DON'T SOMEONE LEAVE YOU HAVE THAT POSITIVE STATEMENT DE EVAN. AND I WISH I COULD BE A THE. I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THIS AND I'M GOING TO BE PUSHING IN THE REPUBLIC* ASSAULT TWENTY FIVE MEMBERS TO VOTE FOR THIS. I DON'T HAVE A VOICE ON BECAUSE I AM GONNA REALLY BUT I AM THE OLD GUY ON THE GROUP SO. I'LL TELL I'M NOT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FOR OUR STATE FOR THAT WE STARTED OFF DISCUSSION ON EQUITY. THE VALUE OF EDUCATION INVESTMENT WE MADE FOR SIX YEARS NOT JUST IN CASE IT WHILE THE CSU AND THE COMMUNICABLE DISEASE. AND UC'S ASSAULT I WILL PUSH FOR THIS I JUST ASK THAT YOU CONTINUED TO WORK ON THESE NUMBERS AND GO FORWARD. AND NOT BECAUSE. QUITE FRANKLY. THE STATE. OUR SOCIETY OUR ECONOMICS DEPEND ON YOU BEING SUCCESSFUL. SO THAT'S WHY TO ME AS I LOOK AT THE. BUDGET ACROSS THE UNITED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A BUDGET. WE HAVE IN THE STATE. THERE'S PROBABLY NO GREATER EXPENDITURE OF OUR RESOURCES THAN FOR. ARMED. CAR PEOPLE DON'T BE ABLE DO A GOOD ECONOMICALLY AND RAISE FAMILIES TO BE HAPPY AND. SO NICE TO LITTLE FRESNO AND BE GREAT. LIFE'S GOOD. SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR DOING AND I'LL TRY TO PUSH MY REPUBLICANS TO SUPPORT I THINK IT. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE DICE. SCENE NINE. HER TESTIMONY AND WILL CALL UP THE. NEXT PAN. THANK YOU WELCOME. MORNING. THE MORNING I AM A PROGRAM OF THE DIRECTOR OF AN WOMAN MANAGEMENT SERVICES AT THE CSU CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE TODAY. AS YOU KNOW THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA STATE BUDGET CALLED ON THE CSU TO ADOPT POLICIES RELATED TO TO ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT TOPICS. ONE ON THE REDIRECTION OF ELIGIBLE STUDENT APPLICATIONS FROM IMPACTED PROGRAMS OUR CAMPUSES TO NON IMPACTED PROGRAMS OUR CAMPUSES. INTO THE PRIORITIZATION OF LOCAL APPLICANTS FOR IMPACTED PROGRAMS. THE DEADLINE PRESCRIBED IN THE BUDGET FOR THE APPROVAL OF THESE POLICIES WAS MAY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. THE CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES PASSED POLICIES TO ADDRESS THESE TWO ITEMS AT THEIR MARCH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN MEETING. THE POLICIES WILL BE IMPLEMENTED BEGINNING WITH THE FALL TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN APPLICATIONS CYCLE. DURING MY TESTIMONY ALL DISCUSSED THE CONSULTATION PROCESS WE USED TO CREATE THE POLICIES AND THEN DESCRIBE EACH POLICY. AFTER THE BUDGET ACT WAS PASSED THE CS YOU ASKED THE LONG STANDING ADMISSION ADVISORY COUNCIL FOR ASSISTANCE AND DEVELOPMENT. AND REFINING THE POLICY PROPOSALS. THE ADMISSIONS ADVISORY COUNCIL HAS BEEN A STANDING BODY OF THE CSU FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS ADVISING THE CHANCELLOR ON ADMISSIONS ISSUES AND REVIEWING SYSTEM WIDE ADMISSION POLICY AND PRACTICES. IT IS COMPRISED OF FACULTY ADMINISTRATORS AND A STUDENT REPRESENTATIVE. IN CRAFTING THESE POLICIES THE COUNCIL HAD THREE MAIN GOALS. FIRST TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH BY THE LEGISLATURE. SECOND TO DEVELOP PROPOSALS THAT ACCOUNT FOR THE UNIQUE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CSU TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES AND THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY OFFER. AND THIRD TO ENSURE INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS HAVE A VOICE IN THE ADMISSION PROCESS. ALL NOW DISCUSS THE REDIRECTION POLICY. REDIRECTION IS A PROCESS WHERE THE CSU SENDS THE APPLICATION OF STUDENTS WHO CANNOT BE ACCOMMODATED AT AN IMPACT OF CAMPUS TO ANOTHER CAMPUS WHERE THE STUDENT CAN BE ACCOMMODATED. THIS POLICY APPLIES TO ALL CSU% ELIGIBLEUNDERGRADUATE APPLICANTS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN ADMITTED TO ANY CSU CAMPUS. THESE APPLICANTS WILL BE NOTIFIED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND ANOTHER CSU CAMPUS. THE APPLICANTS WILL BE PROVIDED A LIST OF NON IMPACTED CAMPUSES AND WILL HAVE TWENTY ONE DAYS TO INFORM US OF THEIR FIRST AND SECOND CHOICE CAMPUS. WHICH ENSURESTHAT THE STUDENT HAS A CLEAR OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A VOICE IN THE PROCESS. AS RESPONSES ARE RECEIVED APPLICATION RECORDS WOULD BE TRANSMITTED FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO THEM NON IMPACTEDCAMPUSES. THE STUDENTS WOULD THEN BEGIN RECEIVING COMMUNICATIONS AND AN OFFER OF ADMISSION. APPLICANTS WHO DO NOT RESPOND WITH THEIR CAMPUS PREFERENCES WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY REDIRECTED TO A NON IMPACTED CAMPUS THAT STILL HAS CAPACITY. THESE CHANGES WILL HELP ENSURE THAT NO STUDENT MISSES OUT ON THEIR CHANCE TO ATTEND TO SEE US YOU. THE SECOND POLICY RELATES TO LOCAL ADMISSIONS AND IMPACT OF PROGRAMS. IN THE CONTEXT OF ADMISSION IMPACTION OCCURS WHEN AN UNDERGRADUATE MAJOR PROGRAM OR CAMPUS RECEIVES APPLICATIONS FROM MORE ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS THEY CAN BE ACCOMMODATED. GIVEN THE RESOURCES OF A PROGRAM OR CAMPUS. UNDER THIS POLICY EVERY IMPACTED PROGRAM AT EACH CSU CAMPUS WILL BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FIRST PRIORITY TO LOCAL APPLICANTS. LOCAL APPLICANTS WOULD STILL BE SUBJECT TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL IMPACTION CRITERIA IMPOSED ON ALL APPLICANTS HOWEVER FIRST PRIORITY WOULD MEAN THAT APPLICANTS GPA. ELIGIBILITY INDEX SCORE OR OTHER REQUIREMENTS WOULD RECEIVE A BOMB. PROVIDING A FINITE ADVANTAGE OVER APPLICANTS FROM OUTSIDE THE LOCAL AREA. SUPPLEMENTAL IMPACTION CRITERIA IS USED TO ENSURE APPLICANTS ARE ACADEMICALLY PREPARED FOR THE MAJOR THEY ARE APPLYING. FOR EXAMPLE A FIRST TIME FRESHMAN APPLICANTS APPLYING TO BIOLOGY WOULD NEED A MINIMUM SAT SCORE. AND AN UPPER DIVISION TRANSFER APPLICANT WOULD NEED TO MEET THE MINIMUM TRANSPORT REQUIREMENTS AND HAVE TAKEN CHEMISTRY AS PART OF THEIR GENERAL EDUCATION. CAMPUSES WILL BE REQUIRED TO CLEARLY PUBLISHED THEIR FIRST PRIORITY INFORMATION ON THEIR IMPACTED PROGRAMS WEBSITE. FIRST PRIORITY WOULD MEAN THAT APPLICANTS GPA ELIGIBILITY INDEX SCORE OR OTHER REQUIREMENTS WOULD RECEIVE A BUMP. IMPORTANTLY FIRST PRIORITY IS NOT AN ADMISSIONS. IS AN ADMISSION ADVANTAGE NOT A GUARANTEE. THIS POLICY BALANCES LOCAL PRIORITY AND ACCESS TO SPECIFIC PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS. FOR STUDENTS AS ACADEMIC PROGRAMS VARY THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM. FOR EXAMPLE IF AN APPLICANT LIVES IN THE LOCAL AREA CHANNEL ISLANDS A CAMPUS THAT DOES NOT HAVE AN ENGINEERING PROGRAM. AND WANTS TO PURSUE AN ENGINEERING DEGREE AT CAL POLY POMONA THIS POLICY PERFECT PRESERVES THE APPLICANT'S ABILITY TO ACCESS PROGRAMS THAT OTHER CSU CAMPUSES PROVIDING OPTIONS FOR ALL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. FOR FIRST TIME FRESHMEN APPLICANTS NOT ADMITTED TO THEIR LOCAL CSU CAMPUS UNDER THIS PROPOSAL THE UNIVERSITY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO INFORM THESE APPLICANTS ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE OPTIONS. HIGHLIGHT THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER PROGRAM AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO CONSIDER TRANSFERRING TO A CS YOU IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION ANY FIRST TIME STUDENT THAT WAS CSU ELIGIBLE AND NOT ADMITTED BY THEIR LOCAL CAMPUS WOULD HAVE THEIR APPLICATION REDIRECTED TO A NON IMPACTED CAMPUS. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT THIS COMMITTEE DISCUSSED LAST SPRING. HAS HE JANET NOTES YES YOU HAS TWO TYPES OF IMPACTION. WHEN I CAMPUS DECLARES CAMPUS IMPACTION LOCAL STUDENTS WHO MEET MINIMUM SYSTEM WIDE QUALIFICATIONS. WHICH IN MANY CASES MOST CASES IS THAT BE AVERAGE AFTER A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE. THOSE LOCAL STUDENTS GET. FIRST PRIORITY TO BE ADMITTED. AND SO IN THE CASE OF OUR LA CAMPUS IMPACTION NON LOCAL STUDENTS. ARE SUBJECT TO STRICTER SUPPLEMENTAL CRITERIA AND SO YOUR AGENDA PAGE FIFTEEN SHOWS THAT THERE'S CURRENTLY ELEVEN CAMPUSES THAT HAVE. CAMPUS IMPACTION THAT AGAIN GIVE THAT FIRST PRIORITY TO LOCAL STUDENTS MEETING THE MINIMUM SYSTEM Y. QUALIFICATIONS. I CAMPUS CAN ALSO DECLARE PROGRAM IMPACTION. AND UNDER THAT SITUATION ALL STUDENTS LOCAL AND NON LOCAL MUST MEET STRICTER SUPPLEMENTAL CRITERIA SO IT'S NOT ENOUGH UNDER PROGRAM IMPACTION FOR LOCAL STUDENT TO MEET. THE MINIMUM SYSTEM WIDE QUALIFICATIONS OFTEN THOUGH LOCAL STUDENTS ARE AWARDED EXTRA ELIGIBILITY POINTS LIKE A GPA BUMP TO HELP MAKE THEM MORE COMPETITIVE. AND THE AGENDA ALSO SHOWS ALSO ON PAGE FIFTEEN CURRENTLY SIX CAMPUSES HAVE DECLARED ALL OF THE PROGRAMS TO BE IMPACTED. PROGRAM IMPACTION ALLOWS CAMPUSES TO ADMIT HIGHER PERFORMING ON LOCAL STUDENTS YOU THE STUDENTS THAT MEETING THE SET THE STRICTER. CRITERIA BUT THE POLICY CAN MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR LOCAL APPLICANTS WHO MEET MINIMUM SYSTEM WIDE A REQUIREMENTS. TO GET INTO THE LOCAL CAMPUS THAT'S A PROBLEM A FAIR PLAY SPEND. SO IS MISS GRIMAUD NOTED THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR AGREED ON LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET ACT LAST YEAR THAT REQUIRES A BOARD OF TRUSTEES TO PROVIDE FIRST PRIORITY FOR IMPACTED PROGRAMS. TO LOCAL STUDENTS WHO MEET THE MINIMUM SYSTEM WIDE. QUALIFICATIONS THAT LANGUAGE IS ON PAGE SIXTEEN IT'S THE SECOND BULLET POINT THERE. THAT'S FROM THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE. AND AS MUCH GROW AND NOTED THE BUDGET AX ALSO REQUIRES THE TRUSTEES TO ADOPT A NEW POLICY ON AUTOMATICALLY REDIRECTING. STUDENTS THAT DON'T GET INTO CAMPUS THEY APPLY TO. AND SO AS YOU JUST HEARD AT ITS MARCH MEETING THE TRUSTEES ADOPTED THE A TO POLICIES. FROM OVERALL WE FIND THAT THE RESULTING OF THESE RESULTING POLICIES ARE A REALLY A MIXED BAG. WITH REGARD THE REDIRECTION POLICY THAT THE BOARD ADOPTED. LAST MONTH. I WE FIND IT'S IN LINE WITH LEGISLATIVE INTENT. AND THIS PROMO OUTLINED IT WELL AND IN THE POLICY REALLY SIMILAR TO WHAT CSU ALREADY DOES FOR SO APPLICANTS WHO HAVE AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER IT AUTOMATICALLY REDIRECTS YOUR APPLICATION. SHOULD THEY NOT GET INTO A CAMPUS THEY APPLY TO. NOUN THE TRUSTEES POLICY ON ADMISSIONS PRIORITIZATION ó HOWEVER WE GET CAMP WOULD GET GIVE CAMPUSES A GPA BOMB. OR OTHER NATIONS ADVANTAGE TO LOCAL STUDENTS AND APPLIED IT TO ANY IMPACTED PROGRAM BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT LOCAL STUDENTS WOULD STILL BE SUBJECTED TO STRICTER SUPPLEMENTAL. CRITERIA SO THE POLICY FROM READING IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO DO. WHAT THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE REQUIRES WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR HAS HAVE REQUIRED AND OF THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE DOES NOT REQUIRE CAMPUSES TO GIVE LOCAL STUDENTS? IT ADMISSIONS ADVANTAGE TO GET INTO IMPACT A PROGRAM RATHER THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE REQUIRES. THE CAMPUS IS TO GIVE LOCAL STUDENTS FIRST PRIORITY WHEN MEETING MINIMUM SYSTEM WIDE QUALIFICATIONS. AND IT'S AND IT REALLY IS UNCLEAR AT THIS POINT. FROM CSU HOW MANY PROGRAMS CURRENTLY DO PROVIDE AN ADVANTAGE TO SOME KIND OF LOCAL STUDENTS AND HOW MANY PROGRAMS AND STUDENTS WOULD BE IMPACTED BY WHAT I WHAT THEY'RE PROPOSING TO DO WHICH IS TO GIVE US. A BUMP I MAKE SURE THAT ALL PROGRAMS GET A BUMP. SO THE LEGISLATURE HAS A FEW OPTIONS HERE. ONE OPTION IS TO ALLOW CSU TO GO FORWARD WITH THIS NEW POLICY ON ADMISSIONS PRIORITIZATION. SEE WHAT HAPPENS ARE SEE HOW THE POLICY PLAYS OUT. SEE HOW LOCAL STUDENTS ARE AFFECTED AND WHETHER YOU SEE. MORE STUDENTS FROM A LOCAL AREAS GET INTO IMPACTED PROGRAMS AND YOU CAN DECIDE IF. THAT. INFORMATION AND THAT CHANGE IS SUFFICIENT. AND IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT LEGISLATURE INTENSE. ANOTHER OPTION IS TO DIRECT CS YOU TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD HAVE THE TRUSTEES ARE ADOPTED NEW POLICY THAT'S IN LINE WITH THE. WITH THE LANGUAGE ARE IN THE THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE. ARE AGAIN THAT'S ON PAGE SIXTEEN. ARE OR YOU COULD YOU SPECIFY IN STATUTE YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT YOU WANT OF THE POLICY TO BE THAT. MAYBE IS NOT PREFERABLE BECAUSE IS MISS GROWN NOTED IT IT IS A COMPLEX SYSTEM AND CSU KNOWS IT SYSTEM BETTER THAN THE LEGISLATURE OF COURSE BUT. IF IF YOU DECIDE THAT YOU REALLY WANT. CS YOU TO DO WHAT THE LANGUAGE SAYS THAT SO HE'S ALWAYS AN OPTION NOW HAVE THEM GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD AND VOTE ON A NEW POLICY AT THE TRUSTEES LEVEL OR TO SPECIFY THE POLICY. IN STATUTE. BUT A QUESTION I'M NOT SURE I AM CLEAR ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CAMPUS IMPACTION. IMPACTION IN ALL PROGRAMS RIGHT. SO THE DIFFERENCE IS BUGS FOR CAMPUS IMPACT SHOWN THAT IS LEVEL IMPACTION SO THEY'RE IMPACTED EITHER AT THE TRANSFER LEVEL OR THE FIRST TIME. EGGMAN LEFT. SO THEY GET MORE QUALIFIED APPLICANTS OUT THAT LEVEL THEN THEY CAN ACCOMMODATE. PROGRAM AND PACK SANDWICHES IMPACTION ALL PROGRAM SO FOR THE CAMPUSES OUTLINED ON THE BOTTOM OF PAGE FIFTEEN. THEY GET MORE QUALIFIED APPLICANTS FOR EVERY MAJOR A PROGRAM THAT THEY OFFERED THAN THEY CAN PROVIDE ACCESS SO THE FIRST ONE BEING FOR FRESHMEN. AND WORK DANCE FOR. YEAH AND AND THE SECOND ONE IN ALL PROGRAMS CORRECT. AND JUST TO TO. MAYBE MAKE A LITTLE MORE A CONCRETE OR PERSONAL IF IF YOU LOOK AT PAGE FIFTEEN OF THE AGENDA. UNDER CAMPUS IMPACTION YOU CAN SEE SACK SACRAMENTO SACRAMENTO STATE NEW PRESIDENT NELSON WAS JUST YOUR SACRAMENTO STATE HAS DECLARED. PRO CAMPUS IMPACTION. WHICH MEANS THAT IF YOU'RE A LOCAL STUDENT YOUR COME FROM THE SERVICE AREA AROUND. SACRAMENTO NAY THEY HAVE LINES THAT THEY'VE DRAWN WITH FREEWAYS AND THAT SORT OF THING WHAT COUNTS AS WELL AS A LOCAL OR REGIONAL STUDENT. IF YOU MEET THE MINIMUM SYSTEM WIDE QUALIFICATIONS. AS A. FRESHMAN OR AS A TRANSFER STUDENT. URINE AT SAC STATE AND SO GET FOR IN MOST CASES THAT MEANS FOR OUT RECENT HIGH SCHOOL GRAD. CITY GRADUATED FROM. DAVIS HIGH SCHOOL AND THEY GOT A A THREE OH GPA. THEY WOULD. THEY WOULD BE AND THEY WOULD GET THAT GUARANTEE THEY WILL GET FIRST PRIORITY TO GET INTO SACKS STATE. NON LOCAL WILL SAY STUDENTS FROM SAN JOSE AND AND REALLY WANTS TO COME TO SAKS STATE. THEY WOULD NEED TO. MEET HIGHER STRICTER SUPPLEMENTAL CRITERIA THEY MIGHT NEED A HIGHER GPA FOR EXAMPLE TO GET IN. PROGRAM IMPACTION. TAKES AWAY. THAT. KIND OF A. FOR LOCALS IT TAKES AWAY THAT IT REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY HAVE TO THAT HAVE MINIMUM SYSTEM WIDE. QUALIFICATION SAYS THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH HAVING MINIMUM SYSTEM MY QUALIFICATIONS ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH ANYMORE. YOU NEED TO COMPETE WITH NON LOCAL STUDENTS TO GET INTO YOUR LOCAL PROGRAM. SO. THE STUDENTS SAY IN SAN DIEGO. WHO WANTS TO GO TO SAN DIEGO STATE AND I BELIEVE THAT IS AN ISSUE? RIGHT WOULD HAVE A HARDER TIME GETTING INTO SAN DIEGO STATE. THAT AND AT IN A STUDENT IN IN SACRAMENTO. THAT'S CORRECT AND SO IF A STUDENT LIVES WITHIN SAY A MILE OF SAN DIEGO STATE HAVING THAT A MINIMUM YOU KNOW CHIEF GCR CARMEN IS NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH AND IN MOST CASES. AND AND JUST A POINT OF CLARIFICATION. EVEN THOUGH THE CAMPUSES ARE UNDER EITHER NO CAMPUS IMPACTION WORK CAMPUS IMPACTION DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY DON'T HAVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE IMPACTED SO FOR EXAMPLE EVERY CAMPUS EXCEPT DOMINGUEZ HILLS BECAUSE THEY DON'T OFFER IT. IS IMPACTED AND THEIR NURSING PROGRAM SO I APPLY TO SACRAMENTO STATE THOUSAND NURSING AT MAJOR I STILL HAVE TO MEET THE ADDITIONAL CRITERIA. AND COMPETE EVEN IF I AM A LOCAL STUDENT. FOR A SPACE IN THE NURSING PROGRAM. WITH THIS NEW POLICY WHAT WE'RE ASKING IS FOR CAMPUSES EVEN IN NURSING TO GIVE THEIR LOCAL STUDENTS A BOMB IN THE LOCAL AT FROM LOCAL STUDENTS TO EXPAND IN THE. YEAH I KINDA MAKE IT EASIER FOR LOCAL STUDENTS TO GET INTO THEIR. LOCAL. RIGHT TO AN IMPACTED PROGRAMS THAT ARE SAYING IS A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE BECAUSE IT'S IMPACTED OUT TWENTY TWO OF OUR WHAT TWENTY ONE OF OUR TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES SINCE. MARITIME DOES NOT OFFER NURSING BECAUSE I THINK WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT A CSU STUDENTS IS THAT THEY ARE SOMEWHAT PLACE BOUND. CORRECT THAT THAT A STUDENT WHO MAY GET TURNED AWAY AT SAN DIEGO OR SALMON MEDINA. MIGHT NOT HAVE THE ABILITY. TO TO CHOOSE TO COME TO SAKS STATE. AM I CORRECT IN THAT CORRECT AND THAT'S WHY THE PRO THE POLICY. ADDRESSES PROGRAM IMPACTION AND GIVES LOCAL STUDENTS A FINITE ADVANTAGE OVER STUDENTS THAT ARE IN THE NON LOCAL AREA. SUGGESTED. CLARIFY AND MAKE SURE. YOU GIVE THE EXAMPLE YOU GAVE THE EXAMPLE OF OF NURSING AT SAC STATE. IF YOU READ THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE ON PAGE SIXTEEN IT TALKS ABOUT. CAMPUSES THE TRUSTEES HAVE TO ADOPT A POLICY WHEREBY CAMPUSES PROVIDE FIRST PRIORITY TO IMPACT THE PROGRAM'S TO LOCAL STUDENTS WHO MEET MINIMUM. MINIMUM SYSTEM WIDE QUALIFICATIONS SO. MY READING OF THIS ARE READING THIS IS THAT. WHAT THAT MEANS IS THIS A STUDENT WHO MET THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS SAY IT IT DAVIS HIGH SCHOOL GOT THAT THREE POINT EIGHT GPA? WOULD GET OUR FIRST PRIORITY. IN. SACKS STATES NURSING PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE. AND THEN NONLOCAL STUDENTS WOULD NEED TO MEET. A REAL HIGHER HIGHER REQUIREMENTS WHAT CS USE. POLICY IS THAT THEY ADOPTED. LAST MONTH. WHAT THAT WOULD DO WOULD SIMPLY GIVE A A KIND OF A GPA BOMB? SOME SORT OF ADVANTAGE TO THAT DAVIS STUDENT TO GET AND NURSING PROGRAM BUT NOT NESTLING. ALLOW THEM TO GO FIRST IN LINE. SO IT'S ITS IT SEEMS TO BE SOMEWHAT OF A DIFFERENT. POLICY FROM WHAT THE BUDGET. REQUIRES AND AND THAT WAS OUR OUR COMMENT ABOUT YOU HAVE SOME OPTIONS YOU COULD YOU COULD LET THAT POLICY GO THROUGH. SEE WHAT HAPPENS SEE HOW MANY LOCAL STUDENTS GET INTO THEIR LOCAL PROGRAMS YOU WILL WHAT'S THE AND WHAT'S THE EFFECT OF THIS WHERE YOU COULD JUST GO BACK LEGISLATURE GO BACK AND SAY CSU. THIS ISN'T UP TO SNUFF. WHAT WHAT KIND OF IMPACT WITH THIS POLICY HAVE ON A CAMPUS LIKE? CAL STATE SAN LUIS OBISPO THAT ALREADY HAS SOME OF THE HIGHEST. ADMISSIONS KNOWN AVERAGE GPA. ALSO I A I THINK PROBABLY. ONE OF THE LOWEST DIVERSITY. ALSO OF CSU WHAT KINDA IMPACT MIGHT THIS POLICY HAVE ON ON THAT CAMPUS. SO WITH THIS NEW POLICY ALL CAMPUSES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO INCREASE. SO SOME CAMPUSES ARE READY HAVE SOME TYPE OF LOCAL PRIORITY BUT THE INTENTION IS FOR THEM TO INCREASE THE ABOUT THE BOMB FOR LOCAL STUDENTS AND HAVE AN INCREASE THE NUMBER OF LOCAL APPLICANTS THIRD BETTER ACCEPTED TO EVERY CSU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS NO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND WE WILL GO NOW TO PUBLIC COMMENT IT THANK YOU. HI MY NAME'S JENNIFER EGAN I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION THAT REPRESENTS THE TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND OR SO PROFESSOR'S LECTURES LIBRARIANS COUNSELORS AND COACHES. WHO TEACH AND MENTOR US STUDENTS IN THE CSU SYSTEM? US CFA CALLS ON THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE A GREATER INVESTMENT IN THE CSU THIS YEAR. WE ARE ASKING FOR FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO FULLY FUND THE CSU. SEE A FACE PROPOSAL MORE CLOSELY MATCHES THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS AND OF THE STATE. SEE A FACE PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH THE CLASSES THEY NEED AVOID ANOTHER TUITION INCREASE IN BOTH OF THOSEARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE TO GET STUDENTS TO TIMELY COMPLETION. AND ADMIT AN ADDITIONAL EIGHTEEN THOUSAND QUALIFIED STUDENTS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE TURNED AWAY. AND AS WAS NOTED THIRTY ONE THOUSAND STUDENTS WERE TURNED AWAY LAST YEAR ALONE. SEE IF A IS ALSO URGING THE LEGISLATURE TO ADOPT A BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR FUNDING AT FOR FUNDING TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF FULL TIME TENURE TRACK FACULTY AT CSU CAMPUSES. SEE IF THEY PROPOSES THAT THE STATE SET ASIDE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF EXISTING ONGOING FUNDS TO INCREASE THE HIRING OF TENURE TRACK FACULTY. WITH ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES ATTACHED A AS TO HOW THAT MONEY WOULD BE SPENT. FIFTY YEARS OF RESEARCH SHOWS THAT BUILDING A RELATIONSHIP WITH A PROFESSOR IN RICH IS A STUDENTS EXPERIENCE FOR UNDERSERVED STUDENTS AND STUDENTS OF COLOR THAT CONNECTION IS EVEN MORE CRITICAL. FACULTY MEMBERS ARE NOT JUST EDUCATORS THEIR MENTORS AND TRUSTED CONFIDANTES WHO HELP STUDENTS NOT JUST COMPLETE A DEGREE. BUT TO RECEIVE A TRULY HIGH QUALITY AND MEANINGFUL EDUCATION. AND ON A SIDE NOTE IN RESPONSE TO THE LA O. ANALYSIS AND I APPRECIATE AND A MISTER STORM FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE MENTIONING THAT'S. IT'S THE CSU OF FACULTY RECEIVING SALARY INCREASES THAT ACCORDING TO THAT REPORT WHERE ABOVE INFLATIONARY COSTS. THAT STATEMENT IS MISLEADING AND LACKING CONTEXT TAKEN ALTOGETHER SALARY INCREASES FOR FACULTY MEMBERS OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS HAVE NOT QUITE KEPT UP WITH INFLATION. AND FACULTY AND I WENT WITH NO SALARY INCREASES FROM FOR FIVE YEARS FROM TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TO TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND THAT'S REALLY NO SALARY INCREASES BECAUSE WE DO NOT RECEIVE STEPS. WE REQUEST YOUR CONSIDERATION AND SUPPORT FOR BOTH OF OUR FUNDING PROPOSALS. OUT WE ALSO INVITE THE COMMITTEE TO JOIN US TOMORROW APRIL FOR A ON THE CAPITAL NORTH STEPS SCFA LEADERS STUDENTS THE CHANCELLOR AND MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES. AND LEGISLATIVE LEAD LEADERSHIP ADVOCATE FOR A GREATER INVESTMENT IN THIS YES YOU WORK AND HAVE OUR AND A LOT OF FUN AND YOU SHOULD COME SEE ARE REALLY COOL OUR INSTALLATIONS WORK AND HALF. THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS LILLIAN TAY'S AND I'M CHAIR OF THE POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE FOR THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION. FOR OUR PRESIDENT GEN EGAN JUST MENTIONED CFA IS FUNDING ASK FOR THE CSU BUT EVEN THIS REQUEST WON'T RESTORED THE DECADES OF CUTS AND UNDER FUNDING THAT HAVE PLAGUED OUR STUDENTS AND. OUR AND OUR SYSTEM WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS A DEDICATED SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR HIGHER EDUCATION AS WE ALREADY HAVE FOR K. FOURTEEN. SO THAT WE CAN RESTORE FREE HIGHER EDUCATION TO THE STUDENTS OF OUR STATE TODAY. A QUICK LOOK AT FUNDING FOR THE CSU OVER THE PAST THIRTY YEARS SHOWS WHY WE NEED A DEDICATED FUNDING SOURCES. BED YEAR IN BAD YEARS THE SYSTEM SUFFERED EXTREME CUTS BEEN IN GOOD YEARS THERE WAS NEVER ENOUGH REINVESTED IN THE SYSTEM. TO RECOVER. ACCORDING TO THE PP I SEE STATE FUNDING PER STUDENT AS CSU AND YOU SEE REMAINS WELL BELOW PRE RECESSION LEVELS. DESPITE RECENT SHIFTS OF HIGHER EDUCATION COSTS FROM THE STATE TO STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. WE NEED A DEDICATED FUNDING SOURCE BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO REALITIES THAT WE CAN'T IGNORE. FIRST WE KNOW THAT THE STATE INVESTED MORE MONEY PER STUDENT THIRTY YEARS AGO WHEN THE STUDENTS WERE WHITE. THAN IT DOES TODAY WHEN THREE FOURTHS OF OUR STUDENTS ARE OF COLOR WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE ARE ON TRACK TO FULL SHORT BY ABOUT ONE POINT ONE MILLION NEEDED COLLEGE GRASSROOTS BY TWO. TWO THOUSAND THIRTY A HUNDRED THOUSAND ARE TEACHERS WILL NEED OVER THE PAST NEXT TEN YEARS. THE CSU NEEDS MORE INVESTMENT RIGHT NOW FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR BUT IN THE LONG RUN THE SYSTEM REALLY NEEDS A DEDICATED SOURCE OF FUNDING. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA AND MURATSUCHI THANK YOU FOR HANGING AROUND FOR PUBLIC COMMENT I'M JAKE PRIMARY WITH THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY I'M HERE TODAY TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO OPEN UP TO SEE IF YOU TO SERVE MORE OF THOSE. HARDWORKING TALENTED STUDENTS WERE DOING EVERYTHING THEY'RE TOLD INDICATOR TWELVE SYSTEM AND COMPLETING A THROUGH G. AND BEING TURNED AWAY YEAR AFTER YEAR. BY THE PEOPLE'S UNIVERSITY OF THE CSU. SOME QUICK BACK OF THE ENVELOPE MATH FOUR YEARS OF MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND STUDENTS BEING TURNED AWAY HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS THAT WE ARE. PUT HOPEFULLY SEEN GO TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE POINT CAME UP THAT THAT MAY BE A LOWER COST MEANS FOR THE STATE TO OFFER LOWER DIVISION. CURRICULUM TO STUDENTS HOWEVER THE CAMPAIGN CAME OUT WITH A REPORT LAST YEAR THAT SHOWED THE DIVISIONAL CLIMATE TAKES FOR STUDENT TO START A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AND GET TO THE FOUR YEAR INSTITUTION RESULTS IN THAT STUDENT FOR THE SAME BACHELOR'S DEGREE PAYING A PREMIUM OF MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO THE STATE. IS REALLY PUTTING STUDENTS IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY WILL TAKE OUT GREATER DEBT TO ATTAIN THE SAME DEGREE WHEN WE KNOW THAT THEIR COLLEGE READY AND ABLE TO GO DIRECTLY INTO THE CSU. CALIFORNIA'S FORTY NINTH IN THE NUMBER IN THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ENROLLED IN FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS. WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT NOT ONLY FOR SOCIAL MOBILITY AND TO ENSURE THAT IT REALLY I'M REMAINS THE VEHICLE FOR UPWARD MOBILITY IN CALIFORNIA BUT TO CLOSE THAT DEGREES GAP THAT I KNOW. THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN. LOOKING AT QUITE CLOSELY THIS YEAR SO WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGE YOU TO LET FULLY FUND AND FOR ALL THOSE TALENTED STUDENTS WERE TRYING TO GET THEM THANK. THANK YOU. HELLO AMY MEN AS WITH THE HISPANIC ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ARE FAIR CITIES HOW COOL ISN'T STRONG SUPPORT AT THE CSU REQUESTS FOR THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE ONE PERCENT ENROLLMENT GROWTH. AND THE GRAD INITIATIVE THESE FUNDS ARE NECESSARY AS THE NUMBER ABOUT THE KNOWN ANOTHER UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS QUALIFYING FOR ADMISSION. CONTINUES TO GROW CONSIDERABLY YET BEING DENIED DUE TO THE LACK OF CAPACITY FUNDS ARE NECESSARY NECESSARY TO SEE FURTHER SUPPORT THE INITIATIVE AND TO ADDRESS THE GAP THAT YOU MAKE IT THINKING. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS AHMED HIM SPARKLES MONTH THIS SOME WITH THE CAST A SITTING ASSOCIATION AND A STUDENT AT CAL SEPARATELY. ON THE REALITIES THAT FUNDING HAS REMAINED VOLATILE OVER THE YEARS AND IT REALLY HAS NOT KEPT UP WITH THE BECAUSE I'M GLAD TO KNOW THAT WE'RE AND BACK TO PRE RECESSION LEVELS. BUT DURING THAT TIME BECAUSE ACTUALLY INCREASE SO I A HAVE NOT EVEN AS WE HEARD KEPT UP WITH INFLATION. I'M I'M HERE TO ADVOCATE PRIMARILY FOR STUDENTS AS WELL AND I WON'T TALK LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT WHAT THE TUITION INCREASE IN ON HOW STUDENTS ARE THINKING ABOUT IT. WITHOUT A FULLY FUNDED CSU. AND AND WHAT THE TUITION INCREASE ON THE TABLE STUDENTS MIGHT BE FORCED TO PAY MORE. FOR THE SAME LEVEL OF SERVICES. ANOTHER THING ALSO WANTED ACTRESS IS THAT WE HEAR THAT FOR THE LEGISLATURE ACCESS. THIS IS A BIG CONCERN BUT I ON I DON'T AT HOWARD ANNUAL CHEST CONFERENCE. WERE OF OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY STUDENTS COME TOGETHER OUR STUDENT TRUSTEES CONDUCTED ANTIBODY WHERE THEY ASKED TO DANCE ABOUT PRIORITIES. INFRASTRUCTURE CAME IN FIRST. STUDENTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HER SAFETY RIGHT. WE NEED SAFE FACILITIES TO BE ABLE TO LEARN. WHAT HAPPENS TO THE STUDENTS? BACK GET ADMITTED WHEN ACCESS IS INCREASED. DO WE ALLOW STUDENTS TO LEARN AND CRAMPING CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE WITH THAT SAID I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMITTEE OFFERED EVALUATES ALL THE PRIORITIES BECAUSE THERE ARE REFLECT. OUR PRIORITY STUDENTS PRIORITIES AND WILL BE STAND BEHIND SO THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING FOR FOR YOU OUGHT TO CHOOSE THE CSU. AND IF BECAUSE OF FULLY FUND THAT'S USE USE BETTER FOR STUDENTS THE SYSTEM. FACULTY STAFF AND A PRETTY MUCH IS BETTER FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HOW GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY AND MY NAME IS MAGGIE Y. DEMOCRATS DO THAT YES HE STANISLAUS I'M VERY PRIVILEGED TO BE THE PRESIDENT? OF THE CAO STATES DO ASSOCIATION AS A LOT OF OUR STUDENTS HERE TODAY AND THEIR RIGHT TO CSU SHIRTS. AS AN ORGANIZATION WE REPRESENT ALL NEARLY HALF MILLION STUDENTS OF THE CSU SYSTEM. AS I'M HERE TODAY TO URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THE CFCS EFFORTS TO INCREASE STUDENT SUCCESS BY FILLING THEIR FULL BETTER CLASS IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THEIR PRIORITY AREAS. AT EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION THEIR GRADUATION INITIATIVE INCREASING ENROLLMENT BY ONE PERCENT MAINTAINING INFRASTRUCTURE AND DRESSING MANDATORY COST INCREASES ACROSS THE SYSTEM. IF THIS BUDGET REQUEST IS NOT FULFILLED. IF THE WORK AT THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE CANNOT CONTINUE. AND THE FACULTY AND SUPPORT STAFF CANNOT BE HIRED IT IS ALWAYS STUDENTS WHO WILL BE HARMED. THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN THROUGH A LONGER ROAD TO GRADUATION WHICH MEANS MORE MONEY OUT OF THEIR POCKET AND THE STATE'S. I'D LIKE TO FINISH BY SAYING. EXCELLENCY REQUIRES RESOURCES. WE CANNOT EFFICIENCY OUR WAY TO EXCELLENCE NOR CAN WE EXPECT STUDENTS TO DO THEIR BEST WORK IN CRUMBLING BUILDINGS WITH OUTDATED EQUIPMENT. STUDENTS DESERVE BETTER AND SO DOES THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING OF ISAKA MIGHT. COLLEAGUES THOUGHTS AND THANK YOU FOR STAYING AROUND TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT MANY WITH CARLA CAMACHO I AM CURRENTLY A JUNIOR. HIGH CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CHICO AND I SERVE BOTH THE STUDENT BODIES OF CHICO STAY IN THE STEAM BODIES OF THE ENTIRE CSSA. AS A CIVIC ENGAGEMENT OFFICER. I AM A DOCKET STUDENT AND MY SISTER ALSO ENROLLED AT A CSU IS ALSO A DOCTOR STUDENT. WE ARE THE STUDENTS ARE TRULY TO DEPEND ON THE STATE SUPPORT OF THE CSCO. BECAUSE WE DON'T QUALIFY FOR FEDERAL AID WE DON'T QUALIFY FOR PELL GRANT LOANS ANY OF THAT WE RELY SOLELY ON CAL GRANT WHICH YES WE DO QUALIFY FOR BUT THAT BARELY COVERS. CAMPUS FEES WHEN YOU LOOK AT MY CAMPUS FOR EXAMPLE LOOKING TO RAISE OUR FEES ARE KEPT SPECIFIC FEES BECAUSE. WE FEAR THAT IF WE ARE NOT FULLY FUNDED AS A CSU. WE WILL FALL SO BELOW. OUR NEEDED MONIES TO OPERATE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OFFICER A TO OFFER ANYWHERE NEAR THE SAME QUALITY OF EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS. SO WE ARE COMING UP WITH WAYS UNFORTUNATELY THOUGHT THAT REQUIRES STARTING THE STUDENTS. TO MAKE UP FOR THAT. AND UNFORTUNATELY CAL GRANT DOESN'T COVER MY SKIP A SPECIFIC FEES SO THAT'S IN ADDITIONAL BURDEN FOR ME SOME SHOOTER AG TO PEACEFULLY FROM THE CSU. AND STAND WITH STUDENTS LIKE MYSELF AND MY SISTER THAT TRULY RELY ON THIS TO PURSUE THE AMERICAN DREAM THINK YOU. HELLO I THINK YOUR STICKER ON MY NAME TO ME OR SOMEONE I AM ALSO STUDENT ACT BECAUSE THE UNIVERSITY SAN MARCOS AND REPRESENTING THE CS IS A. GOTHIC STUDENT ASSOCIATION OF THE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT OFFICER I'M JUST LIKE MY COLLEAGUE CARLA CAMACHO I DO NOT QUALIFY FOR ANY FEDERAL OR STATE AID US ON THE ONLY ONE I DO CONFERENCE CALL GRANT. AND SOLELY RELYING ON THAT DOES NOT COVER ALL OF MY FEET SO WE DO URGE YOU TO FULLY SUPPORT AND FUND THE CSU BECAUSE STUDENTS LIKE MYSELF A HARLEY REPRESENTED IN THE CSU SYSTEM. STUDENTS FROM MY PARK ON TO ALWAYS GET AN OPPORTUNITY AXES GRANTED TO US TO GO TO THE CSU INTERNAL HIGHER EDUCATION COLLEGE OR FORTY INSTITUTION. I LOOK AT MY LITTLE BROTHER AND SEE HOW HE'S HE SEES ME STRUGGLE WITH ABBY THREE JOBS WORK AN AVERAGE JUST TO FULLY SUPPORT MYSELF. YOU KNOW MY BASIC MEANS AND UNCOVER MY TUITION AS WELL ON THE AMOUNT OF LOANS I MEAN NOW THAT THAT AND I AM IN NOW. IS VERY HIGH AND EXPENSIVE SO WE BELIEVE THAT RELY ON THE STATE SUPPORT FOR THIS NEVER THE IDEA TO FULLY SUPPORT THE CSU AND FUND US FOR. STUDENTS LIKE MYSELF AND OTHER STUDENTS HAVE WORKED AVERAGE SO LADIES BEGINS TO DETERIORATE. SEE ISSUES OF THE MOST ACCESSIBLE FORM OF HIGHER PUBLIC EDUCATION WE DO NOT DESERVE TO BE TREATED LIKE SECOND HAND CITIZENS WE MIGHT NOT HAVE THE FLASHY YOU SEE TITLE THAT WE DO HAVE THE MOST HARD WORKING STUDENTS. THE OFTEN JUGGLE FAMILY JOBS COSTS OF LIVING THIS IS ALL ON TOP OF BEING A FULL TIME STUDENT ODYSSEY ISSUE THE AMERICAN DREAM IS NO LONGER AS EASILY ATTAINABLE THE COST OF LIVING ALONE CAN BE AS EXPENSIVE AS TUITION. ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA. CSU IS A GATEWAY TO UPWARD MOBILITY CASTERLY HAS PROVEN TO BE THE NEWLY THE NATION'S LEADING UNIVERSITY BEHIND ACCOMPLISHING THIS. VERY. UPWARD MOBILITY FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. AND I WANTED TO JUST THOMAS' COMMENT ON. COLLEGES WORKING WITH CHANCE FOR SINNERS I PERSONALLY AND WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT CHAIR. DR MCLENDON CREATES ETHICAL INDIVIDUALS WITH CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS ARE PROVIDES THE ECONOMY WITH THE PROFESSIONALS WE NEED AND IT COMPETES WITH BIGGER UNIVERSITIES. AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICE AND THAT'S WHY I AM HERE IT'S LIKE. BUT YOU KNOW ASKING FOR MORE. LOW MANY WAS ALSO MARGO'S I AM A STUDENT AT HOW SILLY ALSO WITH THE ASSOCIATED STUDENTS INCORPORATED. I AM A GRANT RECIPIENT RECIPIENT BUT JUST BECAUSE I RECEIVE GRANTS DOES NOT MEAN I AM WELL OFF WITH THE COST OF LIVING IN LOS ANGELES CONSTANTLY INCREASING ALONGSIDE. OTHER BASIC NEEDS BUT SOME STUDENTS AND SUPPOSITION POSITIONS LIKE I MENTIONED MY TUITION IS COVERED BY CRAP MY TEXT BOOK SIGNING NEITHER IS MY FOOD FACED WITH HOUSING OR FOOD INSECURITY. AND IF WE HAVE A TUITION INCREASE WILL HAPPEN TO THE STUDENTS THEY MADE THEY MAY NEED TO TAKE LESS COURSES MAKING UNDERSTAND THE CSU LONGER. WE TELL PEOPLE TO GO TO SCHOOL. GET A DEGREE PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION AND GET. AND WHEN THEY GET THERE THEIR FACE WITH LARGER ISSUES PLAN IT MAKES ME THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE CSU HOW MANY MORE TUITION INCREASES WILL WE FACE. AND HOW WILL THIS OF A AFFECTS STUDENTS OF COLOR LIKE MYSELF SO I ASK YOU TO DATE TO PLEASE CHOOSE THE CSU. THINK YOU THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME'S MEDICARE'S I'M ALSO A STUDENT OF CATHOLIC I'M ALSO PART OF A ASSOCIATE STUDENTS COOPERATED OF I'M ALSO HERE ADVOCATING FOR I MYSELF AND ALL THE STUDENT SINGLE PARENTS. IN DANGER OF HOMELESSNESS OF FOOD INSECURE AND. LAWLER PROBLEMS IS. ESPECIALLY TUITION INCREASE IS THE FACT THAT. THEY'RE GONNA THEY'RE HAVING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN LIVING EXPENSES ARE HAVING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN BUYING THE KIDS THINGS ARE HAVING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THAT AND WITH TUITION INCREASE. IT IT BECOMES. IT BECOMES A LOT HARDER FOR THEM TO. MAKE A CHOICE AND. OVERALL IT. THE BIGGEST FEAR FOR US AS VETERANS IS THE LACK OF ATTENTION I GUESS. WE DO SEE AN INCREASE IN OUR DROP OUTS FOR VETERANS. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE IS SPECIAL BECAUSE. WE FEEL LIKE WE'VE DONE SO MUCH ALREADY FOR THE COUNTRY AND EVERYTHING THAT WE REALLY CHOOSE TO GO TO COLLEGE TO BETTER OURSELVES. AND BECAUSE ALL OUR TIME TO CAN'T FIND WORK OUT THERE. WE ESPECIALLY HAVE A HUGE NUMBER OF DISABLED VETERANS WHO. HAVE RETURNED TO SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY CAN NO LONGER WORK IN THE WORKFORCE. ANOTHER THING THAT WE'VE NOTICED IS. THE LACK OF SERVICES I GUESS. THE LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE. CLASSES CLASS OPTIONS IS DEATHLY ONE SO SHE VETERANS WHO I'D ATTEND THAT ARE RECEIVING BENEFITS WE HAVE TO. MORISSETTE PATH WE CAN. WE CAN DIVERGE FROM THAT PATH WE WE'RE.

NOT FUNDING THE CSU ONLY MAKE LIFE HARDER FOR MY PEERS THEY HAVE FINANCIAL AID COVERED STUDENTS WILL NOT FEEL A DIFFERENCE WITH THE TUITION INCREASE. I HAVE MY TUITION AND FEE IS FULLY COVERED YET I WILL START MY CAR AND MAKE COLLEGE CAREERS WITH TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN DEBT.

A FULLY FUNDED CSU WOULD TAKE THIS PART IN OFFICE STUDENTS OTHERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HELLO EVERYONE MY NAME IS CHRISTIAN I'M A SOPHOMORE AT SAKS THE. FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE SYRIANA POLICY ON THE PREVIOUS TOPICS IN MY FAMILY GO TO COLLEGE. AFTER THIS I HAVE TO GO TO. BIO CLASS. WHICH YOU HUNDRED AND FIFTY STUDENTS BUT ONLY SIXTY SEATS. DOT AN EXAMPLE OF. WHY WE PUT INTO THE CSU WE ARE THIS GRADUATION INITIATIVE IS A GOOD THING? I'M A SOPHOMORE THIS IS ONE OF MY LAST YEAR COURSE IS. I NEED FORTY FIVE UNITS TO START TAKING MY OF MAJOR CLASSES. BUT. IT'S PRETTY TYPICAL I'D SEEN THAT I HAVE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY STUDENTS IN THE CLOUDS IT'S REALLY HARD TO. ACCESS FOR BUSES AND ADVISERS SPECIALLY YA IN A FEW OF THE BIOLOGY REAP WHEN I'M WORST UP PUT ASSIGNED SEATING SO. IT'S REALLY SOMETHING DOWN STRUGGLING IN. AND. THAT'S NOT. THE ONLY CLASS THAT IMPACT IS ACTUALLY A LOT OF THE NURSING PROGRAMS ARE IMPACTED. AND ALL OTHER G. E. AND BUSINESS CLASSES DATA WE NEED FOR THE FUTURE. I ASK ALL OF YOU TRULY CONSIDER FOR IT BUT IN THIS YES YOU DON'T JUST TALK ABOUT IT AT EPITAPH AND. AND. THINKING. THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS VERONICA GARCIA MARTINEZ I AM STUDENT AT HOW SILLY. SO THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE DEFINITELY HAS OUR SUPPORT BECAUSE OF WHAT IT IS PLAN TO ACHIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO HELP STUDENTS GRADUATEIN A TIMELY MANNER AND AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN A HIGHLY QUALIFIED AFFORDABLE DEGREE. HOWEVER IF THERE IS A TUITION INCREASE FOR STUDENTS THE DEGREE STUDENTS THRIVE TO OBTAIN BECOMES ON ACCESSIBLE AND ALTHOUGH STUDENTS LIKE MYSELF WHO RECEIVE FINANCIAL AID. CAN HAVE THE TUITION INCREASE COSTS COVERED THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE WILL NOT COVER NON TUITION EXPENSES SUCH AS HOUSING FOOD INSECURITY COST OF TEXTBOOKS AND OTHER LIVING EXPENSES. IN ORDER TO COVER THESE COSTS STUDENTS RESORT TO TAKING OUT LOANS THAT ACCUMULATES TO THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN DEBT. WE ASK STUDENTS CONTINUE TO GO THROUGH THE STRUGGLES BECAUSE EDUCATION IS A PRIORITY FOR US MANY SEE AS YOU STUDENTS HERE ARE HERE TODAY TO SEE YOUR SUPPORT IN HIGHER EDUCATION. A FULLY FUNDED CSU IS POSSIBLE AND CAN BE ACHIEVED. SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING IS FOR YOU GUYS TO SUPPORT US AND TO CHOOSE CSU. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING I'M KRISTINE MILLER I'M CHAIR OF THE STATEWIDE ACADEMIC SENATE FOR THE CSU. AND I DO WHAT I DO BECAUSE OF ALL THE WONDERFUL STUDENTS THAT WE JUST HEARD IT'S REALLY WONDERFUL. I'M I'M HERE THAT TODAY THOUGH TO TALK ABOUT PHYSICS. AND THE THE PART ABOUT PHYSICS PART OF THIS WAS STEPHEN HAWKING'S I'M YOU KNOW. RECENT PASSING THAT THAT MOTIVATED US BUT I HEARD RYAN STORE MENTION THE WORD MOMENTUM THREE TIMES TODAY. AND JEFF GOLD MENTIONED IT AND PRESIDENT CASTRO MENTION DEBT AND THEN I HEARD LOTS OF METAPHORS LIKE RAMPING UP BEYOND TRAJECTORIES AND GLIDE PADS ALL THAT HAS TO DO WITH MOMENTUM THAT WHEN YOU GETSOMETHING STARTED. IT IT PAYS DIVIDENDS WHEN YOU STOP IT COLD. JUST LIKE AN OBJECT IN MOTION REMAINS IN MOTION WHEN YOU STOP THAT MOTION. THE PROGRESS AND STE AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE WITHOUT FULL FUNDING. SO WHEN I HEAR FOR INSTANCE FOR THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SAY THAT WE SHOULDN'T FIND THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE THAT DEFIES LOGIC TO ME. WHEN I HEAR THE GOVERNOR SAY WE SHOULD GIVE THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY TO THE CSU AND TO THE UC THAT DEFIES LOGIC TO ME IT DEFIES PHYSICS.
