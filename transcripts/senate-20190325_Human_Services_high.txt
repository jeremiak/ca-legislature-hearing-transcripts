US SENATOR UMBERG'S S. R. EIGHT HAS BEEN PULLED FROM THE AGENDA SO WE WILL NOT BE HEARING THAT RESOLUTION TODAY. WE WILL BE TAKING ACTION ON THREE BILLS. ONE OF WHICH CENTER WORKS IS ON CONSENT. AND WE WILL. GO AHEAD. SINCE WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM. WE WILL START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE. WE HAVE A SENATOR JACKSON HERE TO PRESENT SENATE BILL. TWO EIGHT ZERO WELCOME SENATOR JACKSON. AND YOUR WITNESSES WE ASK THAT WOULD ASSIST KEEPER TESTIMONY TO TWO TO THREE MINUTES PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. OF I GUESS MEMBERS I SIT ON THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL -- FIRST -- LET ME -- INDICATOR -- THAT I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ON PAGE TEN OF THE ANALYSIS AND APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF IN. ASSISTING ON THIS MEASURE. NO THIS IS A BILL THAT REALLY JUST -- BASICALLY TRIES TO FULFILL THE ADAGE IS A STITCH IN TIME SAVES -- NINE THIS IS S. B. TWO AT THE DIGNITY AT HOME ACT WHICH SEEKS TO ALLOW MORE SENIORS AND DISABLED INDIVIDUALS TO AGE IN PLACE. AND STAY IN THEIR OWN HOMES THROUGH THE USE OF HOME MODIFICATIONS. THAT SIMPLY REDUCE THE RISK OF FALLING. ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE EVERY DAY IN CALIFORNIA TURNED SIXTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE WE ARE NOW AN AGING STATE. WHAT IS SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS A NEGATIVE BIRTH RATE STATE? AND AS A RESULT -- WE ARE AGING IS A POPULATION IN NEED TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE REALITIES THAT TAKE PLACE. AS ONE AGESIN TURN SIXTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE. SENIORS -- ARE MORE LIKELY TO FALL OBVIOUSLY IN SERIOUSLY INJURE THEMSELVES AND LET'S SAY A TWO YEAR OLD WHO BOUNCES BACK AND HAS NO CLUE THAT THEY'VE JUST HURT THEMSELVES BECAUSE FRANKLY. THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO HURT THEMSELVES WITH THE FALL THAN SOMEONE WHO IS AGING AND SUFFERING THROUGH THERE. THE RAVAGERS OR THE THE CHALLENGES OF OF THAT AGING EXPERIENCE. 33% OF ALL FALSE AMONG OLDER INDOOR ADULTS INVOLVE HAZARDS AT HOME. ONE THIRD OF THE FALLS IT'S SENIORS EXPERIENCE IS AS A RESULT OF A FALL AT HOME DUE TO THINGS LIKE. POOR LIGHTING LOOSE CARPET A LACK OF SAFETY EQUIPMENT THINGS LIKE GRAB BARS STAIR RAILS HIGH TOILETS FOR EXAMPLE. THEY ARE A PARTICULAR RISK. 80% OF THE FALLS HAD HAPPEN TO INFILTRATE HOME HAPPEN IN THE BATHROOM. SO THIS BILL DOES TWO THINGS TO HELP SENIORS AND THOSE WITH DISABILITIES MAKE THEIR HOME SAFER. AND A PLACE THAT WILL ACCOMMODATE THEM FOR YEARS TO COME FIRST. THIS BILL AUTHORIZES THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING. THE ISSUE GRANTS TO OUR AREA AGENCIES ON AGING. FOR INJURY PREVENTION SERVICES IN THE HOME THIS IS THE STATION TIME. THESE GRANTS CAN BE USED TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS AROUND THE HOME THINGS THAT I JUST MENTIONED WHICH ARE CAUSES OF FALSE THINGS LIKE POOR LIGHTING. THINGS LIKE ADDING GRAB BARS OR ROOM -- JUST SIMPLY NAILING DOWN CARPET THE PEOPLE WOULDN'T NECESSARILY THINK TO DO. SMALL IMPROVEMENTS LIKE THIS FRANKLY CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. OUR AGING IN PLACE AND EXPERIENCING A POTENTIAL FUTURE BEING INSTITUTIONALIZED. WE HAVE WE DO NOT HAVE ADEQUATE HOME FACILITIES NOW FOR OUR AGING POPULATION. SO IT BEHOOVES US TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ASSIST SENIORS SO THAT THEY CAN AGE AN AGE WITH DIGNITY IN THEIR OWN HOMES. SECOND THIS MEASURE ASKED THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. DURING THE NEXT TRIENNIAL BUILDING STANDARDS RULEMAKING CYCLE. TO DEVELOP AND PROPOSE FOR ADOPTION BY THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION'S. BUILT THE BUILT COMMISSION EXCUSE ME BUILDING STANDARDS REQUIRING FALL PREVENTION STRUCTURAL FEATURES TO BE IN PLACE. FOR SINGLE AND MULTI FAMILY DWELLINGS TO PREVENT FALLS AND TO FACILITATE AGING IN PLACE THESE FEATURES COULD INCLUDE THINGS LIKE ONE GROUND LEVEL ENTRY WIDE INTERIOR DOORS. ADEQUATE SPACE IN BATHROOMS AND KITCHENS FOR MANEUVERABILITY OF CHAIRS FOR EXAMPLE BLOCKING IN BATHROOMS TO ALLOW FUTURE GRAB BAR INSTALLATION. REACHABLE ELECTRIC CONTROLS AND A STEP FREE PATH THROUGH THE ENTIRE GROUND FLOOR. SIMPLE MEASURES LIKE THIS WHICH SHOULD AS CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO AGE WE WILL BE ABLE TO USE TO HELP PEOPLE PREVENT THOSE FALLS IN THE EXTRAORDINARY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM IN FACT IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY IT'S ESTIMATED. THAT WE SPEND FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ADDRESSING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SENIORS FALL IN THIS COUNTRY WE CAN DO BETTER. AND IT IS MY HOPE THAT AS WE MOVE THIS. LEGISLATION FORWARD WE ARE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THAT A STITCH IN TIME. DOES INDEED SAVE NINE AND WITH ME TODAY ISSAND WARREN REPRESENTING THE BILL'S SPONSOR THE CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE. AS WELL AS MAXINE MAN TELL FROM THE NATIONAL MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS ASSOCIATION EXCUSE ME SOCIETY THANK YOU. A MAN WARREN. AND I AM. OF SUBSTITUTING FOR THE AUTHOR. OF THIS BILL. WHO HAD TO BE OUT OF TOWN SO SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT I MAKE? ARE HER COMMENTS BUT I AGREE WITH THEM WHOLEHEARTEDLY -- SHE SAYS THAT HER OWN PASSION. FOR ADD UP ADVOCATING FOR FAILS TO FALL SAFE HOUSING STEMS FROM HER EXPERIENCE. WITH HER STEP MOTHER. WHO SHATTERED HER FEMUR AS A RESULT OF A FALL HE HAD TO STAY IN THE NURSING HOME AND TOLD HER LEG WAS FULLY RECOVERED? FOR MANY MONTHS AS OUR HOUSE COULD NOT ACCOMMODATE HER. IN A WHEELCHAIR. HER HUSBAND WAS UNABLE TO CARE FOR HER IN THE HOME. AND AS THE WHEELCHAIR COULD NOT FIT THROUGH ANY OF THE DOORS INSIDE OR OUTSIDE. SHE WAS NOT ABLE TO VISIT FRIENDS WHO USE WHEELCHAIRS INTO HER HOME TO VISIT. THUS MAKING HER MORE ISOLATED. GIVEN CALIFORNIA'S NEED TO DROP DRAMATICALLY INCREASE AVAILABLE HOUSING THIS IS THE PERFECT TIME FOR THE STATE TO MAKE THAT HOUSING. MORE AGE AND DISABILITY FRIENDLY. BY INCORPORATING FALLS PREVENTION OR SPECIFIC ACCESSIBLE FEATURES INTO THE STATE BUILDING STANDARDS. FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING. MAKING THESE CHANGES WILL ALLOW RESIDENTS TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES AS THEY AGE. AND ALLOWS FAMILIES TO EASILY BRING ELDER MEMBERS INTO THEIR HOME. AS THEY NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. AS I LOOK AROUND MY COMMUNITY I LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT I LIVE IN IS MULTI GENERATIONAL. THERE ARE SENIORS WHO BOUGHT THE HOUSE. AND NOW THE CHILDREN HAVE MOVED IN BECAUSE THE SENIORS CAN NO LONGER LIVE THERE ALONE. THAT IS THE REALITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE I DO BELIEVE. FALL SAFETY FEATURES CAN EASILY COST LESS LOOK. ACROSS MUCH LESS COSTLY WHEN BUILT IN THE ORIGINAL DESIGN OF THE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. AN INDIVIDUAL HOMES RATHER THAN RETROFITTING. I WAS LOOKING AT MY OWN HOME THIS MORNING. AND WONDERING HOW COULD WE RETRO FIT MY HOUSE. SO THAT I COULD STAY IN IT AND I NOTICED THAT THERE WERE SOME THINGS THAT COULD BE. PUT INTO THE BUILDING STANDARDS LIKE. WHEN WE BUILD THE OPENING FOR THE BATHROOMS LET'S SAY? THEIR STANDARD BATHROOM SIZE HOWEVER WE COULD INCREASE THIS THE WIDTH OF IT. OR AT LEAST LEAST GIVE. US GIVE ME SOME [inaudible] A SPACE ON THE SIDE OF THE DOOR. THAT IT COULD BE EXPANDED AND WE COULD MAKE IT WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE -- BUT IF WE START NOW AS THE HOUSING IS BEING BUILT. AND MORE HOUSING IS BEING BUILT. AS A RESULT OF THE HOUSING CRISIS THIS IS THE TIME TO PUT IT IN ACTION. I KNOW IN SAN FRANCISCO THEY WILL BE. INTRODUCING A BOND TO BUILD SENIOR HOUSING BUT THEY'RE ALSO BUILDING OTHER HOUSING AND WE WANT TO MAKE ALL HOUSING AVAILABLE FOR SENIORS AS THEY AGE. WE ASK THAT YOU DO APPROVE THIS BILL AND VOTED TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MAXINE MAN TALENT I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL. MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS SOCIETY ESPY TWO EIGHTY IS AN IMPORTANT BILL FOR PEOPLE DISABLED WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. MS IS A CHRONIC AN AWFUL AND OFTEN DISABLING DISEASE OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. THAT TYPICALLY IS DIAGNOSED IN YOUNG ADULTHOOD. AND THIS IS A PUZZLING AND UNPREDICTABLE DISEASE THAT VARIES WIDELY IN ITS IMPACT NOT ONLY FROM PERSON TO PERSON. BUT ALSO IN THE SAME INDIVIDUAL AT DIFFERENT TIMES. MS CAN IMPAIR MUSCLE STRENGTH SINCE SENSATION BALANCE COORDINATION. GATE AND CAUSE SIGNIFICANT DISABLING DISEASE. STUDIES CONSISTENTLY FIND THAT OVER 50% OF PEOPLE WITH A MASS HAVE FALLEN DOWN IN A THREE TO SIX MONTH PERIOD. AND 3250% HAVE FALLEN MULTIPLE TIMES IN THAT SAME TIME PERIOD. THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL ESTIMATES THAT FALLS ARE MOST MOST THE MOST PREVENTABLE CAUSE OF NURSING FACILITY PLACEMENT. MODEST INVESTMENTS IN HOME MODIFICATION CAN SAVE MONEY INCREASED SAFETY IMPROVE ACCESSIBILITY ALLOW PEOPLE WITH MS TO MAINTAIN INDEPENDENCE IN THEIR OWN HOME. CONTINUE TO WORK AND BE ACTIVE IN THEIR COMMUNITY. WITHOUT SUCH MODIFICATIONS MANY PEOPLE ARE FORCED TO MOVE AFTER FALLS AND INJURIES. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS SUCH AS GRAB BARS AND SHOWERS ARE NEAR TOILETS. ALLOW CONTINUED INDEPENDENCE BY AVOIDING ACCIDENTS THAT LEAD TO INJURIES AND HOSPITAL STAYS. THE INVESTMENT AND OTHER MODIFICATIONS SUCH AS RAMPS AT ENTRANCE DOORS. GRAB RAILS LONG STAYERS RAISE TOILETS AND LOWERED LIGHT SWITCHES ALLOWS A DISABLED INDIVIDUAL CONTINUED INDEPENDENCE AND SAVES MONEY IN THE LONG RUN. BY ALLOWING PEOPLE TO AGE IN PLACE. THE COST OF MODIFYING A HOME TO MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE VARIES WIDELY. THIS GRANT PROGRAM AS WELL AS THE FALL PREVENTION BUILDING STANDARDS ESTABLISHED THREE SENATE BILL. TWO EIGHTY WILL PROVIDE VALUABLE VALUABLE ASSISTANCE AND ENHANCING ACCESSIBILITY. AND KEEPING PEOPLE WITH MS AND OTHER DISABILITY SAFE IN THEIR HOMES. THE NATIONAL MS SOCIETY URGES YOU TO SUPPORT SB. TWO EIGHTY I'D LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND ESTABLISH A CORN CAN WE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MADONNA HI FOR TITLE HERE. STONE. DOWN HERE BELL. BELL HERE JACKSON. JACKSON HERE PAN. AND HERE WINNER [inaudible] WINNER HERE. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED CORN THANK YOU. SO DO WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. KELLY BROOKS I'M HERE THIS AFTERNOON ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND THE VENTURA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS -- THESE TO BE AARON'S PART. THREE SANDERSON ON BEHALF OF THE ARC IN UNITED CEREBRAL PALSY CALIFORNIA COLLABORATION HERE IN SUPPORT. DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. YES MADAM CHAIR ON BOB ROEMER REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION A AND WE HAVE -- SERIOUS CONCERNS ONLY TWO WITH THE BUILDING STANDARD PORTION OF THE BILL FIRST I'D LIKE TO COVER WHAT WE CAN'T SUPPORT -- WE'VE ALREADY INFORMED EIGHT CD THAT WE CAN SUPPORT THE LOWERING OF THE LIGHT SWITCHES IN THE HVAC CONTROLS. IN ADDITION THE INSTALLATION OF GRAB BARS SUPPORT BACKING IN ALL OF THE BATHROOMS IN THE DWELLING IS SOMETHING THAT CAN EASILY BE DONE IT TIME TO CONSTRUCTION. HOWEVER WE DO TAKE ISSUE WITH THE REQUIREMENT FOR ALL INTERIOR DOORS ARE TO BE ADE WIDER -- AND FOR THE CLEAR SPACE REQUIREMENTS AND KITCHENS AND BATHROOMS. ARE THESE TWO ITEMS IN THE COMBINATION WILL EFFECTIVELY REQUIRES STAFF TO REDESIGN. JUST ABOUT EVERY SINGLE FAMILY PLAN THAT'S OUT THERE RIGHT NOW WELL I WOULD ESTIMATE AT LEAST EXISTING TODAY WOULD HAVE TO BE REDESIGNED. ODD TO INCREASE THE THE WORST OF THE DOOR -- MANAGE WHEN YOU GO TO YOUR HOUSE THAT EACH YEAR DOORS ARE NOW ABOUT SIX INCHES WIDER THAT'S WHAT EACH CD WOULD BE CALLING FOR IF THEY WENT FORWARD WITH THE SAME REQUIREMENTS. THE RECORD AND APARTMENTS RIGHT NOW. EFFECTIVELY THAT'S GOING TO BE EATING UP SPACE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE FOR YOUR YOUR CLOSET -- IN FOR THE CLEAR SPACE REQUIREMENTS IN THE BATHROOMS AND KITCHENS YOUR FACT WE GONNA HAVE TO BE MOVING THE WALL OUT ABOUT TWO FEET FROM WHERE IT IS NOW. NOW THERE'S TWO WAYS TO COMPLY WITH THIS REALLY THE HOW TO INCREASE THE OVERALL SIZE OF THE DWELLING UNIT BY ABOUT FORTY TO FIFTY SQUARE FEET IN TOTAL. WAR YOU'LL HAVE TO SIMPLY TAKE THE AREA OUT OF THE MORE MARKETABLE AREAS IN THE HOUSE IT CLOSETS BATHROOMS -- AND I'M SORRY CLOSET SAW AND BEDROOMS. SO WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR -- WE WERE JUST NOTIFIED THAT THIS BILL MAY BE UP AS SOON AS NEXT TUESDAY AND SENATE HOUSING -- WE'RE TRYING TO DEVELOP SOME SORT OF AMENDMENTS TO PROPOSE TO THE AUTHOR AND TO SEND A HOUSING COMMITTEE STAFF -- BUT THREE OR FOUR DAYS IS VERY LITTLE TIME TO DO THAT ANYWAY IF YOU'VE GOT ANY QUESTIONS I CAN. PROVIDE ANSWERS [inaudible] THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION IN THE AUDIENCE. THREE NINE DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. FOR FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THUNDERSTORMS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THE SENATOR JACKSON MAY I CERTAINLY -- APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO -- 50% OF SENIORS OF FALL BREAK THEIR HIP HAVE A 50% MORTALITY RATE SO IT'S IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WE DO WE CAN TRY TO AVOID FALLS. I ALSO DABBLE LIKE REAL ESTATE I LIKE GOING THROUGH NEW HOME DEVELOPMENTS TO KIND OF SEE WHAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON IS AMAZING TO ME HOW MANY. DEVELOPERS ALREADY INCORPORATING A LOT OF COMMON SENSE -- IMPROVEMENTS SAID CERTAINLY ARE. LESS EXPENSIVE IN THE FRONT AND INSTEAD OF GOING BACK AND RETROFITTING ON THE ON THE ON THE BACK AND I SUPPORT. VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING IN THE BILL EXCEPT -- FALL PREVENTION BUILDING STANDARDS -- IN MANY OF THESE DEVELOMENTS THAT I GO SEE -- IF YOU WANNA HAVE WIDER DOORS AND SMALLER CLOSETS AS A RESULT. FOR IT -- IT'S USUALLY AN OPTION THAT YOU CAN DO -- THE BUILDING ENTRIES MENTIONED THEY HAVE TO GO BACK AND AND REDO ALL OF THEIR PLANS AND SOMETHING'S GOT TO GIVE THE ONE THING THAT WON'T. GO DOWN AS THE PRICE AND WE'RE FACING AN AFFORDABILITY CRISIS HERE IN. IN CALIFORNIA AND WALL IT BE GREAT TO SAY THAT WE COULD HAVE ALL THESE IMPROVEMENTS IN STOCK AND ADDED ADD TO THE COST OF HOMES. I'M A REALIST AND KNOW THAT IT WILL INCREASE THE PRICE OF HOMES. AND IT'S OKAY IF SOMEBODY'S WILLING TO PAY IT AND AND WANTS TO HAVE THESE PORTABILITY OPTIONS FOR THEM AS THEY AGE OR WHEN THEY SELL THEIR HOUSE THEY SOUGHT TO AN AGED COUPLE -- BUT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT ALL OF US ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING THE MOST EXPENSIVE PRETTY MUCH IN THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES AND I'M WORRIED THAT THIS WILL HAVE AN EFFECT ON THAT SO -- ARE YOU ARE YOU WILLING TO TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION ON THIS AND I'M ALWAYS WILLING TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO BILL WHICH HAS GOT IT -- SOMETIME LAST WEEK AND OF COURSE -- HAPPY TO TO TRY TO ADDRESS CONCERNS NO ONE WANTS TO MAKE THE COST OF HOUSING MORE EXPENSIVE PART OF WHAT WE WERE THINKING OF AND IF I MAY. US SENATOR OF MY HUSBAND I BOUGHT OUR HOUSE THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO. LITTLE DID WE EXPECT THAT THAT AT SOME POINT IN TIME WE WOULD WANT TO OR NEED TO PUT  GRAB BAR. I INTO THE SHOWER -- WHICH WE DID ABOUT A YEAR AGO AND MY HUSBAND WHO IS NOW THIRTY FIVE YEARS OLDER THAN HE WAS WHEN WE BOUGHT OUR HOUSE. AND FELL AND COMPLETELY TOWARDS ROTATOR CUFF. SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE THE VISITS THE REHABILITATION -- I THINK IT'S RUINED HIS GOLF GAME BUT PROBABLY THAT WAS GOT LONG GONE BEFORE HIS ROTATOR CUFF PROBLEMS. YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY IF WE CAN BE PREPARED AND ANTICIPATE TO THE EXTENT WE CAN DO IT REASONABLY AND LOGICALLY SO THE BASICALLY ALL NEED THAT NEEDED TO BE DONE WAS. TO HAVE IN THE SHOWER THE ABILITY AT SOME POINT IN TIME THE WAY YOU GET THE HOUSE TO TO BE CONSTRUCTED. OUT WOULD ALLOW FOR THAT GRAB BAR IF IF APPROPRIATE OR NECESSARY AND THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THAT WE AS WE AS WE BUILD NEW HOUSING WE KEEP KEEP IN MIND. THAT AT SOME POINT IN TIME GOD FOR BID WE HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER WHO. SUFFERS FROM MS FOR SOME -- DEBILITATING A SITUATION THAT REQUIRES THEM. TO BE -- TRANSPORTED IN A CHAIR FOR EXAMPLE JUST TO HAVE THOSE OPTIONS AVAILABLE AT THE BOTTOM THE MOST OPPORTUNE PRICE POSSIBLE SO CERTAINLY I APPRECIATE THAT THE OPPOSITION -- SEES THE THE GOOD INTENTIONS IN THE POSITIVE ASPECTS OF THIS AND WE'RE CERTAINLY I'M CERTAINLY HAPPY TO WORK WITH THEM TO SEE IF WE CAN'T COME TO EAT AND EVEN BETTER. UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO BECAUSE THE GOAL AGAIN WHEN IT COST FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY AS YOU MENTION 50% THOSE PEOPLE FALL THEY NEVER RECOVER. OR THEY END UP IN THE HOUSE -- INSTITUTIONAL CARE WHERE EITHER MEDICARE OUR MEDICARE IS PAYING FOR IT GRAB BARKING COOKING -- COST AS LITTLE AS A FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS. THOUSANDS THAT IT'S SAFE TO SAY NOTHING OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM THOSE EVENTS IN AS YOU KNOW BEING SOMEONE WHO'S VERY ACUTELY AWARE IN THE MEDICAL FIELD YOU DON'T. WE LOSE OUR BALANCE A AS WE AGE AND THESE KINDS OF THINGS BECOME MORE AND MORE PREVALENT SO HAPPY TO WORK WITH THEM APPRECIATE THEIR WILLINGNESS TO DO SO AS WELL ONE PRESHEAF THAT AND OWNING A LOT OF SENIOR ONLY -- UNITS MYSELF -- I OCCASIONALLY GET SENIORS TO COME IN AND SAY WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO LISA'S PLACE FOR ME ABOUT. WE SURE LIKE I'VE GRAB BARS YOU KNOW IN THE SHOWERS OF THE BATHTUB SINCE. DYSLEXIA IS ABOUT A HUNDRED BUCKS I MEAN IS IT'S REALLY INEXPENSIVE TO PUT THE MAN EVEN. YOU KNOW WITHOUT HAVING THEM AS A PART OF A MANDATE TO PUT A MAN WHEN YOU'RE BUILDING A BRAND NEW HOME SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITHTHE MONGOLS SUPPORTED TODAY UNTIL I SEE THAT THERE'S SOME -- AGREEMENT -- WITH OUR BUILDING STANDARDS BUT I I I DO APPRECIATE THE SCOPE AND ANGLE OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO. IT AGAIN IF I MADE THE THE NOTION IS YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO PUT THE GRAB BAR IN IMMEDIATELY INTEREST THAT THE STRUCTURE OF THE HOUSE HAS TO ACCOMMODATE IT. IF YOU DO AT SOME POINT DECIDE TO PUT ONE IN. THANK YOU -- AND I THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON FOR FOR BRING THIS FORD I KNOW THAT TO YOU WE HAD TALKED ABOUT LAST YEAR ABOUT -- THE IN THE BUDGET AS WELL -- PARTICULARLY AROUND THE ISSUES OF THE EMPLOYEE GRAB BARS AND OTHER TYPES OF DEVICES WHICH REALLY DO -- BUT SAVE MONEY AND SAVE LIVES AND ACTUALLY INTERESTED I'D APPRECIATE US ARE SEWN BRING UP THAT STUDY ACTUALLY WORKED ON AT LEAST I KNOW IT WAS THAT SPECIFIC STUDY. BUT A STUDY THAT ACTUALLY SHOW THAT WAS THE FIRST TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE FALLS THAT LEAD TO HAVE FRACTURES THE TIMER TOLERATE WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE WAY BACK THEN. SO I ACTUALLY DID SOME RESEARCH YEAH A LONG TIME AGO BUT I DID RESEARCH AND JERRY AT IN GERIATRICS -- BEFORE I WENT TO PEDIATRICS OF MEDICINE -- SO THE SERVER SO I THINK YOU KNOW I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THIS BILL ANDWHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH -- AND GENTLY SUPPORTED I DO HOPE YOU DO WORK WITH THE BUILDING FOLKS IT IS PROBABLY MORE OF AN ISSUE I GUESS THE HOUSING AND I THINK CENTER WINNER I'M SURE WILL. WEIGH IN ON THAT TWENTY GETS TO THAT POINT -- I I I I THINK I DO SHARE SOME OF THEIR STONES CONCERNS ABOUT -- I'VE I THINK THAT THE DEGREE THAT WE CAN MAKE THE HOUSE READY -- FOR FOR SOME PEOPLE IN AGING PLACE I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING -- YOU MIGHT HEAR FORTY SQUARE ADDITIONAL FORTY SQUARE FEET FEET -- THAT HAS TO BE ADDED TO THE HOUSE YOU KNOW IF THEY MAKE WIDER HALLWAYS AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS -- AND THEN I START THINKING WELL IF IT'S A TWO STORY HOUSE FOR ONE STORY HOUSE HOW MUCH BENEFIT WE'RE REALLY GETTING YOU KNOW WE OBVIOUSLY WANT TO HAVE THINGS THAT BUT AND COST THAT MIGHT BE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT -- YOUNG LADY THANK WHETHER THERE'S A S. MARS NOT THE RIGHT WORD -- BUT YOU KNOW SOME THINK ABOUT THE REALLY WHAT THE TRADEOFFS ARE AND ENTER AND TERMS OF THAT BUT CERTAINLY I THINK. MAKING A GRAB BAR READY AND BE ABLE TO HAVE MONEY TO HELP PEOPLE GET GRAB BARS AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS AND AND SOME MAIL PHONY THE SLICE WITH ALL THOSE THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE FAIRLY I THINK. SIMPLY AND BUT WOULD BE SOME CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE WANT AS OUR STATE IS AGING SO -- I WANT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRAINS BUILT FORD AND BE HAPPY TO MOVE AT THE PROPER TIME. THANK YOU US UNDER JACK. WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE BUT JUST BRIEFLY APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION AGAIN THE GOAL IS NOT TO INCREASE THE COST. OF HOUSING BUT TO MAKE IT. MORE ACCESSIBLE AS WE AGE AND IF WE'RE SO LUCKY AS TO BE LIVING IN THE SAME HOME. WE BOUGHT WHEN WE WERE YOUNG AND FOOLISH AND WHEN WE GET OLDER AND GRAYER -- CERTAINLY I THINK THAT THAT IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL AND AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION IS TO COME TO SOME. US FOR A CONSENSUS ON THE BEST WAY TO PROCEED WITH THAT I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON -- CENTER PAN HAS MOVED THE BILL. THE MOTION IS -- TO THAT. TO PASS AS AMENDED TO SEND A HOUSING COMMITTEE SP TWO EIGHT ZERO SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. HER TITLE HI -- HER TITLE I DON'T KNOW STONE NO. BELL. BELL I JACKSON JACKSON I PAN. PAN HI WINNER WINNER HIGH I HAVE FIVE ONE FIVE ONE PM. THE VOTE IS. FIVE ONE THE BILL IS OUT. NOW WE HAVE SENATOR HERTZBERG'S SP FIVE TWO FIVE EIGHT I'M SORRY. HERE TO PRESENT WELCOME SENATOR HURTS PARK. AND TO YOUR WITNESSES -- WE ASK THAT THE WITNESS OF KEEP THEIR TESTIMONY TWO TO THREE MINUTES PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY. THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS MADAM CHAIR. YOU KNOW. ONE OUR GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN DEALING FOR SOME TIME IN MANY RESPECTS. ON THE ISSUE OF PEOPLE WHO FIND THEMSELVES HOMELESS. WITH THE COMMITTEE HEARING SON DURING THE INTERIM. CAN'T RECALL THE COMMITTEE I WON THE TENDED. AND THAT WAS SEVENTY SIX PROGRAMS IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA FOR HOMES. OF SOME SORT. IN LOS ANGELES WE PASSED MEASURE HHH THE COUNTY H. CITY. WE JUST PASSED THE STEINBERG -- IT DEAL A FEW BILLION DOLLARS FOR PEOPLE WHO FIND THEMSELVES HOMELESS OF MENTAL ISSUES. FOUR BILLION DOLLARS RECENTLY ON A BOND ISSUE I THINK CENTER BELLS ISSUE WAS THAT. WE HAD FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR AND WE HAVE MONEY MONEY MONEY. FOR ALL SORTS OF THINGS BUT THE REALITY IS IN THE FRUSTRATION THAT I HAVE EXPERIENCED HAS. HOW DO YOU TRANSLATE NOT ACTION WHEN I GO IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT I REPRESENT? PEOPLE ARE ANGRY. YOU'RE SAYING JUST YOU PUT WE'RE VOTING FOR ALL THE STUFF WE HAVE SAID WE WILL INCREASE OUR TAXES WE WILL AUTHORIZE BONDS WILL DO ALL THIS STUFF. AND WHAT IS TRANSPIRING. AND SO I BEGAN TO FOCUS ON ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO IN THE HUMAN CONDITION BROADLY SPEAKING. IF YOU WILL -- THAT IMPACT PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT CAN IMPACT THE PRICE OF THE THE ISSUE OF PEOPLE FIND THEMSELVES HOMELESS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE ATTACKS AND WINNER DURING THE BREAK ON THIS A LITTLE BIT I THINK. MEMBER CORRECTLY. AND ARM WHAT WE FOUND IN THE COMMUNITY IS I WAS TRAVELING THROUGH ALL THE NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCILS AND TALKING TO FOLKS WHO FOUND THEMSELVES HOMELESS WAS. AS WAS SUGGESTED TO ME ELEGANTLY. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GO OUT AND DO A SHELTER LEAVE THEIR BEST FRIEND ON THE STREET. AND SOMETIMES OUR BEST FRIENDS. AND SO THE IDEA HERE WAS TO START OUT WITH A I MEAN I'VE EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCIL EVERY PLACE IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY THIS IS. SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY GETS A AND IT'S YOU KNOW IN LOS ANGELES I'M TOLD. THAT IT COULD BE AS HIGH AS 25% OF PEOPLE WITH PETS SO HERE WE ARE IN IN LA COUNTY GOT 22% FOR SOME FACILITIES ON MICE WITH 22% WITH OPEN BEDS BECAUSE PEOPLE WON'T GO BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT TO LEAVE THEIR BEST FRIEND ON THE STREETS. AND SO THIS IS THE FIRST STEP OF PUTTING FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND LIKE YOU TO MAKE A LOT BIGGER QUITE FRANKLY HAVE A GRANT PROGRAM ACCEPTING YOUR MEMBERS JUST WHERE THE MONEY IS TO GO. TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND AVAILABILITY OF PEOPLE WHEN THEY GO IN -- TO THESE FACILITIES THEY CAN BRING THEIR PETS WITH THEM AND OFTEN IT BEGINS TO HELP THEM AS I'M TOLD TO GET OFF THE MARK STREET AS THEY CAN GET SERVICES FOR THEIR PETS THEY CAN ALSO HELP THEMSELVES. IN THAT REGARD AND IT'S OKAY QUITE FRANKLY JUST CONSIDERING THE BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WE'VE AUTHORIZED. GENERAL FUNDS DOLLARS THAT WE'VE AUTHORIZED. AND NEW TAXES THAT WE'VE AUTHORIZED THIS TO ME IS SOMETHING THAT -- YOU KNOW AS WE IS IS IS IS BOTH ENDS OF THE LEASH KIND OF A OF A BILL AND I'MJUST REALLY PROUD OF IT IT'S NOT A GIGANTIC NUMBER BY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE BUT I THINK GIVEN THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE FACING FOR PEOPLE TO FIND THEMSELVES HOMELESS IS. IT IS THE RIGHT APPROPRIATE THING TO DO WITH THIS I WILL TURN THIS OVER TO MY WITNESSES WHOEVER WANTS TO START FIRST. FIRST I'LL GO. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS GINA NAP BUT I MANAGE THE FRONT ST ANIMAL SHELTER FOR THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO -- TODAY TO URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THAT BILL TO FIFTY EIGHT THE HUMAN ANIMAL BOND IS INCREDIBLY POWERFUL. AND IF YOU HAVE PETS THINK ABOUT THEM RIGHT NOW. ACCORDING TO THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE THAT POP REPORT WAS PUBLISHED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN THAT STATED THAT THE LOSS OF A BELOVED PET CAN IMPAIR OUR EMOTIONAL. AND PHYSICAL HEALTH OFTEN TIMES WORSE FOR THE LOSS OF A SPOUSE WHICH I FOUND PRETTY AMAZING. WHETHER YOU LIVE IN A HOUSE OR YOU LIVE IN A TENT ALONG THE AMERICAN RIVER. MAKES NO DIFFERENCE YOUR BOND AND YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR PAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT DIFFERENT AND I CAN ATTEST TO THAT FIRST HAND. BONDS OFTEN EVEN STRONGER FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS NOT JUST COMPANIONSHIP AND PROTECTION. BUT PURPOSE -- SOMETHING TO LIVE FOR AND SOMETHING TO CARE. FOR AND I'VE HEARD IT OVER AND OVER IF I DIDN'T HAVE MY PAT I DON'T THINK I COULD SURVIVE ON THE STREET -- IT IS A REASON TO GO ON LIVING FOR THEM IN MANY CASES. IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN I'M SPENDING BACK TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WHEN I FIRST TOOK THIS POSITION I'M JUST LOOKING AT TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN THE FRENCH REDOUBTABLE SHELTER HAS INVESTED THROUGH GENERAL FIND GRANTS FUNDRAISING. ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS JUST THIS LAST YEAR ON PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS CRATES FOOD LEASHES EVEN SOME BEHAVIOR TRAINING SO PETS CAN BE COULD COMPANION STAYED AND PREVENT BEING A BARRIER FROM HOUSING -- THAT WAS JUST AT THE WINNER TRIAGE SHELTER UP ON RAILROAD THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE OUR LABOR COSTS. DOES NOT INCLUDE -- THOSE ANIMALS THAT CAME TO US AND HAD TO BE IMPOUNDED BECAUSE THEIR OWNERS WERE EITHER HOSPITALIZED OR INCARCERATED WHICH HAPPENS FREQUENTLY. THE THESE ARE THE ANIMALS THAT ARE MOST AT RISK IN OUR COMMUNITIES TO END UP IN OUR SHELTER. I CAN ATTEST FIRST HAND AGAIN PEOPLE REFUSE MEDICAL AID IF IT MEANS THEY HAVE TO GIVE UP THEIR PETS. LITERALLY WILLING TO DIE -- BEFORE THEY LEAVE THEIR ANIMALS OFTEN THEIR ANIMALS EAT BEFORE THEY DO. WE ALL KNOW HOME IS AS AS AN EPIDEMIC THE EPIDEMIC WOULD DO. THAT -- ENDS OF THE LEASE WHICH I CLAIMED I DON'T KNOW WHO STOLE THAT PHRASE INTO ME. BUT THE NEED IS REAL AND THE RESULTS COULD POTENTIALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK. THANK YOU A TEAR WOMEN ARE HOTTER MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK MY NAME IS JANET HENDRICKSON I'M A LICENSED NURSE PRACTITIONER I ALSO HAPPEN TO HAVE THE LICENSE OF THE POSITION ASSISTANT.

MANY OF MY PATIENTS HAVE TOLD ME THAT THEY OFFER GONE THEIR MEDICATIONS THEIR FOOD AND THEY HAVE DEFINITELY TURNED DOWN A PLACE TO LIVE. BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT TAKE THEIR ANIMAL OR ANIMAL WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO THEM. I URGE YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS BILL -- YOUR YES VOTE THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG. THANK YOU WE WILL NOW OPEN FOR PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE BILL IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN THE AUDIENCE LAST EXPRESS GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- JENNIFER FEARING I'D LIKE TO TESTIFY FIRST ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AS A MEMBER OF THE SACRAMENTO COMMUNITY THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT BILL I'M SO GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVE SUCH LEADERS IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT SACRAMENTO IS SETTING SUCH A HIGH BAR AND STANDARD.

FOR MANY THESE HOMELESS -- PEOPLE HOW COME THE FORGOTTEN PEOPLE. THAT -- THEY'RE NOT GOING TO LEAVE THEIR BEST FRIEND -- BEHIND. AND FOR MANY OF THEM IT'S NOT JUST THEIR BEST FRIEND IS THEIR ONLY RELATIVE. IS THE ONLY LOVE THAT THEY EXPERIENCE IN A VERY CRUEL COLD WORLD. AND I SEE -- IN MY DISTRICT CERTAINLY WERE -- WE HAVE A HOMELESS PROBLEM JUST LIKE EVERYWHERE ELSE IN THE STATE -- THAT. MANY PROBABLY ABOUT TWENTY FIVE OR 30% AS WAS MENTIONED I HAVE PETS AND THEY TAKE CARE OF THE PETS BEFORE THEY EVEN TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES. SO THIS IS IT IS A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND I'M HAPPY THAT YOU'RE BRINGING A FOREIGN I'M PRETTY IMPRESSED IN. WITH WHAT YOU'RE DOING IT IN SACRAMENTO THAT'S GONNA SET I THINK OF A MODEL. FOR FOR THE STATE AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA SEE MORE PEOPLE GET HOUSING -- WITH INCORPORATING OF THIS FUNDING SO THAT THEIR THEIR CANINE OR FELINE COME -- COMPANIONS CAN CAN CAN BE CAN BE WITH THEM AND SO IF THE PROPER TIME I LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL. USERS FROM SENATOR WINNING. THANK YOU ROGER THANK YOU THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I'D I SHOULD INTEREST IN BEING CO AUTHOR. ON AND I AS YOU KNOW WE DID -- SOMETIMES SIT DOWN AND SPEAK ABOUT THIS AND I I MEAN THIS IS A GREAT AND AS WE ALSO DISCUSS I'VE -- BILL -- MYSTERY -- FORTY EIGHT THAT -- SETS -- STANDARDS FOR HOMELESS SHELTERS AND ONE OF THEM IS TO START MOVING THE ENTIRE SHELTER SYSTEM. TOWARDS BEING MORE -- PET FRIENDLY -- BECAUSE YOU'RE A SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS THAT WE SEE IN HELPING GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS. BY IN THE SHELTER SO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER -- HOPEFULLY THIS CAN BOTH MOVE FORWARD AND WE CAN -- MAKE SOME REAL CHANGE THANK THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS FOR YOUR KINDNESS. AND JACKSON IS THANK YOU ARE HI I WANT TO PREFACE THIS BY SAYING I'M A LIFETIME. DOG OWNER I UNDERSTAND THIS COMPLETELY MY ONLY CONCERN. IS -- HOW WE CAN GO ABOUT DOING THIS BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO CARE FOR THEIR ANIMALS TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY MEDICAL TREATMENT TO THE THE? VACCINATIONS THE CARROT SET FOR AND MY MY CONCERN IS THAT THEY COME INTO SHELTER IN THE ANIMAL HAS YOU KNOW SOME KIND OF CONDITION THAT IS POTENTIALLY TRANSFERABLE -- IS THERE IS THERE IS SOME PROTOCOL THAT THAT CAN BE DEVELOPED SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT. IF PEOPLE BRING THEIR ANIMALS IN AND THEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO BRINGS IN A SICK ANIMAL THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TRANSFER TRANSMIT THAT IT. THAT ILLNESS TO THE OTHER ANIMALS THERE BECAUSE THAT'S THE QUICKEST WAY TO GET PEOPLE TO SAY FORGET IT I'D RATHER BE ON THE STREET SO. IN THIS PROGRAM IS THERE SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW YOU GONNA GO ABOUT MAKING SURE FIRST OF ALL AN OPPORTUNITY GET THESE ANIMALS FOOD MEDICAL CARE THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE ANYWAY -- OR SHOULD HAVE BUT DO IT IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS THE OTHER ANIMALS WHO MIGHT BE IN THE SHELTER THANK YOU SENATOR THAT'S EXACTLY CORRECT. TO QUALIFY FOR A GRANT TO SUCH A SHELTER MUST HAVE THREE THINGS FIRST. SHELTER FOOD AND BASIC VETERINARY SERVICES FOR PETS OF THE HOMELESS OF THE PEOPLE THAT FIND THEMSELVES HOMELESS TO SHELTERS MUST ESTABLISH YOUR PHARMACIST IS RULES OF CONDUCT RESPONSIBILITY REGARDING PETS AND THEIR OWNERS. CREATING -- KENNELLY EITHER BUNKS OR IN SEPARATE AREAS AND FOOD FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCES HOMELESSNESS WITH ANIMALS AND THREE SHELTERS AND ALSO NEED TO HAVE ACCESS TO A SHELTER THAT AN OFFER SPAY AND NEUTER SERVICES SO THE IDEA OF HAVING THE VAT. AND THOSE SERVICES PART OF IT WOULD BE THE REQUIREMENTS TO QUALIFY FOR ONE OF THESE GRANTS THEY WOULD APPLY. FOR I GUESS MY ONLY CONCERN FOR ME TO THE CHAIR IS SPAY AND NEUTER VERY IMPORTANT BUT I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT PETS WHO MIGHT COME IN WITH SOME. KIND OF COMMUNICABLE OR PROBLEM THAT COULD RUN THROUGH THE SHELTER SO IS THERE SO WHEN YOU SAY GENERAL SERVICES. CAN YOU MAYBE BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC CHEST SO WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WERE. THAT THAT THESE ANIMALS ARE NOT GOING TO BE -- EXPOSING OTHER OTHER PATHS TO POTENTIAL SERIOUS PROBLEMS THAT WE KNOW SOMETIMES DUE TO I THINK I THINK WE COULD PUSH MORE DEFINITION AROUND ABOUT THE IDEA OF HOW REQUIRING A SHELTER OF THAT OF HAVING OF THAT THEY ARE TO BE EXAMINED THE ANIMALS AND THE LIKE. I ASSUME AS A RESULT OF THEIR EXPERIENCES A VETERINARIAN WOULD THEN MAKE THOSE DETERMINATIONS. AS ANY GOOD MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL WOULD AND AND AND SORT OF THOSE STANDARDS I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE MEAN BY SETTING UP THOSE STANDARDS WITH THE WITH THE SHELTER THAT. I WOULD FEEL A LITTLE MORE COMFORTABLE I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR THE BILL BUT I'D FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE IF YOU COULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT SORT OF THE HIGH HIDE ADDRESSING THAT POTENTIAL PROBLEMS WITH IT THAT IT. IS COVERED IMMEDIATELY. AND WITHOUT THE RISKS. OF THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE. TAKE PLACE WHICH I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT BUT I JUST I KNOW THAT THERE ARE INSTANCES A DOGLE COMING WITH MANGE FOR EXAMPLE -- OR SOME CONDITION AND I THINK THAT AS MUCH OF THIS IS A SPECIFIC. REQUIREMENT THAT WHOEVER'S GONNA PROVISOS VETERINARY SERVICES IS GOING TO LOOK ALMOST IMMEDIATELY TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NO THAT THAT THESE ANIMALS WILL NOT BE IN DANGER -- OR BE TRANSMITTING POTENTIALLY DATE A DANGERS ARE FATAL ILLNESSES TO THE OTHER ANIMALS FOR PEOPLE IN THE FACILITY. I CAN SPEAK TO THAT WE OPEN THE CITY OF SEGMENT OPEN THE WINTER TRIAGE SHELTER THAT BECAME WINTER SPRING SUMMER FALL AS YOU ALL KNOW. DECEMBER EIGHTH TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN AND SINCE THEN THERE HAVE PROBABLY BEEN ABOUT THREE HUNDRED ANIMALS GO THROUGH. WE HAVE PROTOCOLS FOR CHECKING IN SEATTLE'S FULLY VETTED VACCINATED ONCE OVER DE WORMED FLEA TREATED. COMPLETELY VETTED WITH VACCINATIONS AND WE MONITOR BI WEEKLY TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO DISEASE THAT WE HAD IN ALL THAT TIME SINCE THEN WHAT IS THAT FOURTEEN MONTHS. FIFTEEN MONTHS -- ONE PUPPY WAS BROUGHT IN WITH PART OF OUR OWN THAT WAS DEALT WITH THE CLIENTS THEMSELVES THE GUESTS ARE TRAINED TO LOOK FOR DISEASE. AND THEY'RE ALSO TRAINED HOW TO APPROPRIATELY DISINFECT JUST LIKE HER HEALTH IN AN ANIMAL SHELTER SO I THINK THAT BE A VERY EASY THING YUP TO INCORPORATE GOOD THANK YOU FENDER BASS. THE USE THE DROP IN CENTERS IN -- SAN JOSE'S FROM BY THE BILL WILSON CENTER AND FEW YEARS AGO -- WHEN I WAS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR -- I VISITED TO LOOK AT A PROGRAM FOR YOUNG -- WOMEN THAT WERE RUN AWAY USE HOMELESS OF LIVING ON THE STREETS. AND SO I GO OVER THERE AND AS I WAS WALKING IN I NOTICED THERE WAS -- DOGS -- TETHERED TO THE POLLS AND I **** WHOSE DOGS ARE THESE AND THEY SAID ALL THE GIRLS OF DOGS. TO PROTECT THEM. AND SO I WALK A LITTLE CLOSER AND ACTUALLY ONE OF THE DOGS CAME OUT AND BIT ME. THIS IS TRUE STORY. SO HE GETS MORE INTERESTING THE THE I WENT TO THE YEAH I JUST. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THEY TOOK CARE OF ME RIGHT AWAY AND THEN I WENT AND TALKED TO THE GIRLS AND LEARNED ABOUT THEIR WHAT THEY WERE DOING. AND THEY SAID THEY HAD THE DOGS FOR PROTECTION BECAUSE THE HOLD. THEY WERE KINDA GIGGLE LAYING OUT OF THOUGHT WAS KIND OF FUNNY THAT THE HE SAID THE BIG GUY WAS BITTEN. AND SO -- ABOUT FOUR FIVE YEARS LATER -- I HAD A STUDENT INTERN WHO IS -- GETTING HER DEGREE AT THE SOCIAL WORK SCHOOL. AS AS A STATE SHE WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT DOING INTERNSHIP IN MY OFFICE. AND SHE SIGNED UP TO WORK ON THE FOSTER CARE PROGRAM. AND SHE SAYS WELL CENTER CENTER I I I I WAS I THINK IT WAS THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME SHE SAID ASSEMBLYMAN. I I MET YOU BEFORE AND I GO WHERE JIMMY MAN SHE SAYS MY DOG SO SHE WAS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE HOMELESS GIRL. GREW UP GOT HER DEGREE AND YOU SPOKE A FEW YEARS AGO AT THE MASTERS IN SOCIAL WORK I GAVE THE SPEECH AT HER GRADUATION. SO I THINK -- IS NOW A SOCIAL WORKER PRACTICING IN SAN JOSE SO I I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW THE DOGS OR IMPORTANT ANGLE PART OF THE SAFETY AND THE THERAPY I'D SAY. AND NOW THE HOMELESS ESPECIALLY YOUNG WOMEN IN THE HOMELESS POPULATION WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT IT THAT WAY IT'S THIS DEFINITELY I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ABOUT THAT. I THINK I WHAT I'M SAYING IS PRETTY MUCH COMMON THROUGHOUT THE CALIFORNIA BUT BUT IN HER CASE IT WAS AN ESSENTIAL -- SHE LIVED ON THE STREETS FOR SEVERAL YEARS HAD A DOG PROTECTED -- AND I THINK IT IT IT IT CREATED THAT SURVIVAL SKILL ENOUGH TO GO OUT AND LATER GET A MASTER'S DEGREE IN SOCIAL WORK. SO I I I SUPPORT THIS CENTER PAT.
