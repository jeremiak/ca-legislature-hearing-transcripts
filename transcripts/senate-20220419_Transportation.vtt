UNFAIRNESS AND HEAR AN

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:55.360

00:29:10.515 --> 00:29:12.083
ANALYSIS IS SAYS THIS BILL WILL

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:13.084
INCREASE THE BILLBOARD

00:29:13.151 --> 00:29:14.519
ADVERTISING REVENUES OF THESE

00:29:14.586 --> 00:29:17.589
ALREADY SUCCESSFUL ORGANIZATIONS

00:29:17.655 --> 00:29:19.424
HOWEVER THIS NEW REVENUE COMES

00:29:19.491 --> 00:29:20.458
AT THE EXPENSE OF THE

00:29:20.525 --> 00:29:22.427
TRADITIONAL OUTDOOR ADVERTISING

00:29:22.494 --> 00:29:24.696
COMPANIES. AND THE COMMITTEE

00:29:24.762 --> 00:29:26.431
WANTED TO JUST STATE THAT THAT

00:29:26.498 --> 00:29:28.333
SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO

00:29:28.399 --> 00:29:28.900
CONSIDERATION. AND SO I'M A

00:29:28.967 --> 00:29:30.335
LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT THAT

00:29:30.401 --> 00:29:32.971
ADVANTAGE THAT WILL BE PLACED

00:29:33.037 --> 00:29:35.740
AND DISADVANTAGED TO SMALLER-

00:29:35.807 --> 00:29:38.409
BILLBOARD. COMPANIES AND I KNOW

00:29:38.476 --> 00:29:40.011
THAT THE INTENT IS THERE WE WANT

00:29:40.078 --> 00:29:41.412
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE

00:29:41.479 --> 00:29:43.615
SUCCESSFUL WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:29:43.681 --> 00:29:44.349
THAT THEY CONTINUE TO EMPLOY

00:29:44.415 --> 00:29:46.117
PEOPLE. I MEAN THE REALITY IS

00:29:46.184 --> 00:29:47.018
YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN GOING TO

00:29:47.085 --> 00:29:48.620
DODGER GAMES SINCE I WAS A

00:29:48.686 --> 00:29:50.555
LITTLE GIRL AND I YOU KNOW I'VE

00:29:50.622 --> 00:29:52.223
ALWAYS KNOWN HIM TO BE

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:52.724
SUCCESSFUL EVEN BEFORE

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:53.291
BILLBOARDS YOU KNOW THE BIG.

00:29:53.358 --> 00:29:54.993
BRIGHT ONES THAT WE SEE NOW AND

00:29:55.059 --> 00:29:57.328
FREEWAYS AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY

00:29:57.395 --> 00:29:59.397
WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL

00:29:59.464 --> 00:30:00.431
AND FOR ME AS I WANT THIS

00:30:00.498 --> 00:30:01.833
CONVERSATION TO IS. TO SOMEHOW

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:03.368
INCLUDE THOSE SMALLER BILLBOARDS

00:30:03.434 --> 00:30:06.738
RIGHT NOW I'M JUST BASED ON THE

00:30:06.804 --> 00:30:08.406
FIRST- SUPPORTER I'M SORRY YOUR

00:30:08.473 --> 00:30:10.108
LEAD WITNESS YOU KNOW THIS IS

WHAT HE SAID THIS BILL WILL

00:30:12.677 --> 00:30:13.645
HELP. GENERATE ADDITIONAL

00:30:13.711 --> 00:30:14.412
REVENUES STADIUMS ARE MISSING

00:30:14.479 --> 00:30:17.048
OUT ON SIGNIFICANT REVENUES WE

00:30:17.115 --> 00:30:17.982
ARE NOT PATHWAY TO BECOME

00:30:18.049 --> 00:30:19.884
PROFITABLE- BUT WE'RE NOT THERE

00:30:19.951 --> 00:30:22.120
YET AND STILL THE CONVERSATION

00:30:22.187 --> 00:30:23.454
REVOLVES. A LOT AROUND

00:30:23.521 --> 00:30:26.624
PROFITABILITY AND I THINK THAT.

00:30:26.691 --> 00:30:28.059
THEY WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE

00:30:28.126 --> 00:30:29.394
GOOD PAYING JOBS BECAUSE THEY

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:31.329
NEED TO THEIR LARGE INSTITUTIONS

00:30:31.396 --> 00:30:33.631
THAT RELY ON GOOD PAYING JOBS TO

00:30:33.698 --> 00:30:35.934

00:30:37.936 --> 00:30:39.537
PROFITS WILL BE THERE IT'S JUST

00:30:39.604 --> 00:30:41.339
A MATTER OF HOW MUCH. MY

00:30:41.406 --> 00:30:44.075
PERSONAL CONCERN IS I WANT TO

NOT. AT A DISADVANTAGE AND I DO

00:30:54.285 --> 00:30:54.819

00:35:07.338 --> 00:35:09.240
PROVIDED BAR CHIEF CONSULTANT.

00:35:09.307 --> 00:35:10.541
BUT THE PROPOSED WHAT THE BILL

00:35:10.608 --> 00:35:12.743
DOES AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:14.245
THREE THINGS TWO OF THEM ARE

00:35:14.312 --> 00:35:16.614
UNCHANGED AT THE HIP AND HAD

00:35:16.681 --> 00:35:17.515
BEEN DEBATED. THE FIRST ENSURES

00:35:17.582 --> 00:35:19.116
THAT FUTURE ARENA BILLBOARDS ARE

00:35:19.183 --> 00:35:20.618
COMPLIANT WITH STATE AND FEDERAL

00:35:20.685 --> 00:35:22.286

00:35:22.353 --> 00:35:24.222
APPROVED IN IN AN UNSPECIFIED

00:35:24.288 --> 00:35:26.657
NUMBER OF DAYS OF THAT IS GOING

00:35:26.724 --> 00:35:28.292
TO BE NEGOTIATED. WING FORWARD-

00:35:28.359 --> 00:35:31.462
EXTENDS ARENA SUNSET UNTIL

00:35:31.529 --> 00:35:32.830
TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. IT REDUCES

00:35:32.897 --> 00:35:34.198
THE MINIMUM DURATION OF THE

00:35:34.265 --> 00:35:35.867
ARENA MARKETING PLAN TO THIRTY

00:35:35.933 --> 00:35:38.936

MENTION THE- CALTRANS

00:35:44.475 --> 00:35:47.144
ENFORCEMENT ISSUE THERE. THERE

00:35:47.211 --> 00:35:48.713
THIS BILL DOESN'T ADDRESS THE

00:35:48.779 --> 00:35:50.815
ENFORCEMENT ISSUE. THIS IS OF

00:35:50.882 --> 00:35:52.817
COURSE NOT YOU KNOW NEW

00:35:52.884 --> 00:35:54.819
BILLBOARDS- BUT- THERE HAD BEEN

00:35:54.886 --> 00:35:56.654
VIOLATIONS IN THE PAST AND SO WE

00:35:56.721 --> 00:35:59.123
NEED TO- GET CLEARED I THINK

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:00.424
MOVING FORWARD FIGURE OUT WHAT

00:36:00.491 --> 00:36:03.127

00:36:03.194 --> 00:36:04.829
BE FOR CALTRANS MOVING FORWARD

00:36:04.896 --> 00:36:07.265
IF THIS BILL SHOULD PASS OUT OF

00:36:07.331 --> 00:36:08.199
COMMITTEE- BUT SENATOR RAZA

00:36:08.266 --> 00:36:09.567
WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADD

00:36:09.634 --> 00:36:10.701
ADDITIONAL. INFORMATION SURE I

00:36:10.768 --> 00:36:13.271
MEAN I THINK WITH REGARDS TO THE

00:36:13.337 --> 00:36:16.741
UNFAIR COMPETITION- AGAIN AND I

00:36:16.807 --> 00:36:19.076
MENTIONED THIS EARLIER- THE

00:36:19.143 --> 00:36:21.646
NUMBER OF SIGNS THAT EXIST

00:36:21.712 --> 00:36:24.148
THROUGHOUT THE STATE SPREAD ALL

00:36:24.215 --> 00:36:28.886
OVER THE STATE. OF IS MASSIVE

00:36:28.953 --> 00:36:29.954
EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED

00:36:30.021 --> 00:36:32.590
SCIENCE- WE'RE TALKING HERE LESS

00:36:32.657 --> 00:36:35.026
THAN ONE PERCENT. OF WHAT WOULD

00:36:35.092 --> 00:36:36.460
BE THE NUMBER THAT COULD BE

00:36:36.527 --> 00:36:40.131
AUTHORIZED BY BY THIS EXTENSION-

00:36:40.197 --> 00:36:42.133
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE-

00:36:42.199 --> 00:36:44.602
ARGUMENT. THAT IN THESE VERY

00:36:44.669 --> 00:36:46.203
LIMITED LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:48.239
STATE THAT IS GOING TO CREATE

00:36:48.306 --> 00:36:50.908
SUCH A DISADVANTAGE- THAT'S ONE

00:36:50.975 --> 00:36:52.643
THE SECOND THING IS I REMEMBER

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:54.078
THAT THERE HAVE TO BE LOCAL

00:36:54.145 --> 00:36:55.780
APPROVALS ARE HAS TO BE LOCAL

00:36:55.846 --> 00:36:57.982
ORDINANCE. THAT THEY ALSO- HAVE

00:36:58.049 --> 00:36:59.984
TO GO FORWARD AND GET- BEFORE

00:37:00.051 --> 00:37:02.219
THEIR LOCAL ENTITIES. SO THEY

00:37:02.286 --> 00:37:06.557
HAVE TO THE ARENA BILL BOARDS

00:37:06.624 --> 00:37:07.858
ALSO HAVE TO GET THAT- THAT

00:37:07.925 --> 00:37:12.797
APPROVAL SO- THE NUMBERS TO SHOW

00:37:12.863 --> 00:37:15.333
THEY'RE NOT UNFAIR COMPETITION-

00:37:15.399 --> 00:37:17.335
THE WAY IN WHICH THEAPPROVALS

00:37:17.401 --> 00:37:19.236
HAVE TO BE DONE. SHOWS THAT THEY

00:37:19.303 --> 00:37:21.606
HAVE TO JUMP THROUGH THE HOOPS

00:37:21.672 --> 00:37:22.974
JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE- AND I

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:25.509
DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE- WHAT ELSE

00:37:25.576 --> 00:37:28.312
TO SAY ABOUT THAT- WITH REGARDS

00:37:28.379 --> 00:37:30.114
TO ENFORCEMENT AS YOU SAID MADAM

00:37:30.181 --> 00:37:33.150
CHAIR- THIS IS. IN CALTRANS

00:37:33.217 --> 00:37:37.054
HANDS WE- THIS OF- EXTENSION OF

00:37:37.121 --> 00:37:39.657
THIS BILL DOES- OF THIS

00:37:39.724 --> 00:37:42.226
EXEMPTION. IS NOT SOMETHING

00:37:42.293 --> 00:37:45.029
THAT'S GOING TO IMPACT THE

00:37:45.096 --> 00:37:46.697
ENFORCEMENT THE ARGUMENT WAS

00:37:46.764 --> 00:37:49.166
MADE THAT THERE ARE SOME SIGNS

00:37:49.233 --> 00:37:51.235
OUT THERE THAT COULD BE OUT OF

00:37:51.302 --> 00:37:53.137
COMPLIANCE. WE DECIDED OKAY

00:37:53.204 --> 00:37:54.372
LET'S DEAL WITH IT MOVING

00:37:54.438 --> 00:37:57.008
FORWARD SO THAT'S HOW WE ADDRESS

00:37:57.074 --> 00:38:01.479
THAT- AND I. I DON'T KNOW WHICH

00:38:01.545 --> 00:38:03.948
OTHER QUESTIONS MADAM CHAIR OKAY

THANK YOU FOR THIS DISCUSSION- I

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.461
YOU KNOW I HAVE LESS OF A

00:38:17.528 --> 00:38:19.864
PROBLEM CONCEPTUALLY OUT OF WITH

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:21.966
THIS BILL IN THE SENSE I DO

00:38:22.033 --> 00:38:23.167
UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WERE JUST

00:38:23.234 --> 00:38:24.435
TALKING ABOUT. AREAS AROUND

00:38:24.502 --> 00:38:27.138
STADIA- I DON'T THINK THAT THE

00:38:27.204 --> 00:38:30.341
TYPES O PLACES. WHERE I THIS

00:38:30.408 --> 00:38:31.275
BILL ENVISIONS ADDITIONAL

00:38:31.342 --> 00:38:33.044
ADVERTISING WITH THE KINDS OF

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:34.078
PLACES THAT LADY BIRD JOHNSON

00:38:34.145 --> 00:38:35.680
HAD MINE WHEN SHE PUSHED THE

00:38:35.746 --> 00:38:37.448
LEGISLATION THE FIRST PLACE. I

00:38:37.515 --> 00:38:39.717
WILL SAY ONE THING THOUGH AND I

00:38:39.784 --> 00:38:42.119
DON'T AND I KNOW. THAT THE

00:38:42.186 --> 00:38:44.622
AMENDMENTS HELP A LITTLE BIT IN

00:38:44.689 --> 00:38:46.357
THIS PLACE BUT I DON'T THINK GO

00:38:46.424 --> 00:38:47.058
FAR ENOUGH. AND I UNDERSTAND

00:38:47.124 --> 00:38:48.859
THAT. WERE ALREADY IN VIOLATION

00:38:48.926 --> 00:38:50.861
OF FEDERAL LAW- THROUGH EXISTING

00:38:50.928 --> 00:38:52.129
PROGRAMS BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE

00:38:52.196 --> 00:38:53.898
TAKING ON A RISK HERE. ARE BY

00:38:53.964 --> 00:38:56.701
DOUBLING DOWN ON THIS SYSTEM ON

00:38:56.767 --> 00:38:57.468
ON THIS APPROACH. I DON'T I

00:38:57.535 --> 00:38:59.704
DON'T HAVE A- UP A CONCEPTUAL

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:02.406
PROBLEM WITH. THE APPROACH I YOU

00:39:02.473 --> 00:39:04.241
KNOW FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. THE

00:39:04.308 --> 00:39:05.876
DRIVE AROUND DODGER STADIUM OR

00:39:05.943 --> 00:39:07.912
OR THE ONE TEN FREEWAY OR ANGEL

00:39:07.978 --> 00:39:10.548
STADIUM THAT'S NOT THE TYPE OF.

00:39:10.614 --> 00:39:11.148
BEAUTIFUL GREEN WAY THE LABOR

00:39:11.215 --> 00:39:13.117
JOHNSON TRY TO PROTECT. IT SO I

00:39:13.184 --> 00:39:15.052
DON'T MIND IF THERE'S NEW MORE

00:39:15.119 --> 00:39:16.153
ADVERTISING RIGHT AROUND THAT

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.022
STADIUM IT'S FINE TO ME BUT- I

00:39:18.089 --> 00:39:19.857
THINK THAT THE FOLKS WHO ARE

00:39:19.924 --> 00:39:21.225
MAKING MONEY OFF OF THIS OUGHT

00:39:21.292 --> 00:39:23.160
TO BE HELPING TO. PAY THE STATE

00:39:23.227 --> 00:39:24.161
A LITTLE BIT TO HELP COMPENSATE

00:39:24.228 --> 00:39:26.163
US FOR THE RISK THAT WE'RE

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:26.831
TAKING. ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FOR

00:39:26.897 --> 00:39:28.065
OUR HOW ARE HIGHLY FUNDS BECAUSE

00:39:28.132 --> 00:39:29.934
THE END OF THE DAY THE

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.469
ACCOUNTABILITY COMES TO US AND

00:39:31.535 --> 00:39:33.237
NOT TO THE FOLKS. WHO COULD BE

00:39:33.304 --> 00:39:34.438
VIOLATING THE LAW- ON THE GROUND

00:39:34.505 --> 00:39:37.374
AND I WANT TO BRING THAT UP AND

00:39:37.441 --> 00:39:39.176

MY COLLEAGUES YOU KNOW IT IT

00:39:40.745 --> 00:39:41.846

TAKING ON. THIS THERE'S NO

00:39:43.047 --> 00:39:44.482
UPSIDE TO THE STATE HERE IN

00:39:44.548 --> 00:39:45.950
SPITE OF THE BIG RISK THAT WE'RE

00:39:46.016 --> 00:39:48.219
TAKING ON AS WE CONTINUE TO

00:39:48.285 --> 00:39:49.153

00:39:54.291 --> 00:39:56.026
CERTAINLY LOVE TO HEAR. WHAT IT

00:39:56.093 --> 00:39:59.630
. IF I COULD. HERE TO DROP- THE

00:39:59.697 --> 00:40:01.031
ROUTE WE'RE ADDRESSING THE RISK

00:40:01.098 --> 00:40:02.666
IN A WAY THAT'S NOT BEEN

00:40:02.733 --> 00:40:03.267
ADDRESSED THERE HASN'T BEEN

00:40:03.334 --> 00:40:05.469
LANGUAGE THIS IS MUCH STRONGER

00:40:05.536 --> 00:40:07.772
LANGUAGE THAN WHAT EXISTS NOW AS

00:40:07.838 --> 00:40:10.574
FAR AS CALTRANS RESPONSIBILITIES

00:40:10.641 --> 00:40:12.243
WE'RE GIVING MORE TEETH TO THEM

00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:15.746
SAYING IF YOU GET A NOTICE. IF

00:40:15.813 --> 00:40:17.047
YOU GET A NOTICE FROM THE STATE

00:40:17.114 --> 00:40:19.116
AND- LET ME JUST BACK UP THERE

00:40:19.183 --> 00:40:21.285
IS NO THERE ARE BEEN NO SPECIFIC

00:40:21.352 --> 00:40:23.053
NOTICES THAT ARE BROUGHT TO AND

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.789
BEEN BROUGHT TO ANYBODY'S

00:40:24.855 --> 00:40:25.356
ATTENTION THAT THE FEDERAL

00:40:25.422 --> 00:40:27.424
GOVERNMENT HAS ISSUED SO AS FAR

00:40:27.491 --> 00:40:29.627
AS WITH. WE KNOW YOUR IT THEY

00:40:29.693 --> 00:40:31.595
AREN'T ANY GOING ANY SPECIFIC

00:40:31.662 --> 00:40:34.331
NOTICES BUT MOVING FORWARD IF US

00:40:34.398 --> 00:40:36.567
UP A NOTICE IS GIVEN BY THE

00:40:36.634 --> 00:40:37.501
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT THERE'S

00:40:37.568 --> 00:40:39.737
A VIOLATION THE DEPARTMENT HAS

00:40:39.804 --> 00:40:44.074
THE RIGHT TO. TAKE IT DOWN THE

00:40:44.141 --> 00:40:45.176
CALTRANS HAS A RIGHT TO TAKE IT

00:40:45.242 --> 00:40:47.411
DOWN I MEAN THAT'S MORE POWER

00:40:47.478 --> 00:40:49.880
THAN THEY'VE EVER HAD- SO WE

00:40:49.947 --> 00:40:51.448
AGREED TO DO THAT EVEN THOUGH

00:40:51.515 --> 00:40:53.184
THERE'S NO PROOF THAT OR

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:55.019
EVIDENCE THAT. BY PUTTING UP

00:40:55.085 --> 00:40:56.620
SOME MORE SIGNS THAT THAT'S

00:40:56.687 --> 00:40:58.322
GOING TO MEAN THAT THE SIGNS ARE

00:40:58.389 --> 00:41:00.124
ALL IN VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW

00:41:00.191 --> 00:41:02.393
WE'RE SAYING IS OKAY IF THERE'S

00:41:02.459 --> 00:41:04.295
A CONCERN ABOUT THAT LET'S

00:41:04.361 --> 00:41:06.130
ADDRESS IT LET'S GIVE MORE POWER

00:41:06.197 --> 00:41:08.666
TO CALTRANS AND THEY'LL BE ABLE

00:41:08.732 --> 00:41:10.868
TO TAKE DOWN A DISPLAY IF

00:41:10.935 --> 00:41:12.570
THERE'S A NOTICE BEING GIVEN TO

00:41:12.636 --> 00:41:14.071
IF THERE'S A THREAT IF THEY

00:41:14.138 --> 00:41:15.906
THINK THERE'S A THREAT. OF

00:41:15.973 --> 00:41:17.208
LOSING FIVE OF FEDERAL FUNDS

00:41:17.274 --> 00:41:19.310
THEY CAN TAKE IT DOWN SO THERE'S

00:41:19.376 --> 00:41:21.712
A WAY TO CURE THE PROBLEM- IN A

00:41:21.779 --> 00:41:23.981
WAY THAT STRONGER THAN IS EVER

00:41:24.048 --> 00:41:25.382

PENALTIES IF THEY DON'T DO IT

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:37.995
WHAT WHAT'S THE MECHANISM BY

00:41:38.062 --> 00:41:39.530

UNDERSTAND THAT WE'VE GOT

00:41:48.239 --> 00:41:50.274
DIFFERENT WAYS I'M JUST TRYING

00:41:50.341 --> 00:41:51.308
TO STAY WITH THE MECHANISMS FOR

00:41:51.375 --> 00:41:52.610

TAKE IT DOWN. OKAY THANK YOU

00:43:11.088 --> 00:43:13.357
FEW TWEAKS THAT NEED TO BE MADE

00:43:13.424 --> 00:43:14.959
A FEW ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE

00:43:15.025 --> 00:43:16.060
ADDRESSED THAT AREN'T MAJOR

00:43:16.126 --> 00:43:17.261
CHANGES BUT ARE RATHER MINOR

00:43:17.328 --> 00:43:19.697
CHANGES WERE DISSATISFIED- SOME

00:43:19.763 --> 00:43:22.700
OF THE OPPOSITION. BUT IT IS

00:43:22.766 --> 00:43:24.802
INCUMBENT ON US AS LEGISLATORS

00:43:24.868 --> 00:43:25.869
IN THIS COMMITTEE TO PROPERLY

00:43:25.936 --> 00:43:27.571
VET THESE BILLS AND MAKE SURE

00:43:27.638 --> 00:43:29.773
THAT WE ARE NOT PASSING BILLS.

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:31.442
THAT ARE FILLED WITH HOLES AND

00:43:31.508 --> 00:43:33.444
HAVE MAJOR PROBLEMS RELATING TO

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:35.179
THE CORE ISSUE THAT THE BILL IS

00:43:35.245 --> 00:43:36.113
TRYING TO ADDRESS AND THAT IS

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:39.416
WHAT I SEE. WITH THIS BILL IT IS

00:43:39.483 --> 00:43:41.285
. IT MAKES NO SENSE FOR US TO

00:43:41.352 --> 00:43:43.320
PUSH BILLS FORWARD THAT WE KNOW.

00:43:43.387 --> 00:43:45.122
AREN'T READY WITH THE HOPES OF

00:43:45.189 --> 00:43:47.291
AT SOME POINT DOWN THE ROAD IT

00:43:47.358 --> 00:43:49.093
WILL GET FIXED BECAUSE WHAT

00:43:49.159 --> 00:43:50.227
HAPPENS- TOO OFTEN IS IT BECOMES

00:43:50.294 --> 00:43:53.831
A MESS. IN THE OTHER HOUSE AND

00:43:53.897 --> 00:43:54.865
THEN IT'S- I MEAN THAT'S NOT THE

00:43:54.932 --> 00:43:57.701
PROPER WAY. TO DO OUR JOBS HERE

00:43:57.768 --> 00:44:00.604
SO I THINK THIS BILL IS. IS NOT

00:44:00.671 --> 00:44:02.172
READY TO MOVE FOR YET THAT IS MY

00:44:02.239 --> 00:44:03.741
OPINION I WILL ADD ON. THOUGH

00:44:03.807 --> 00:44:05.409
THAT THE SMALLER TRADITIONAL

00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:08.045
OUTDOOR ADVERTISING COMPANIES-

00:44:08.112 --> 00:44:08.979
YOU KNOW AREN'T BEING GIVEN THE

00:44:09.046 --> 00:44:10.848
SAME ADVANTAGE. THAT YOU ARE

00:44:10.914 --> 00:44:13.517
GIVING THESE OTHERS IN YOUR BILL

00:44:13.584 --> 00:44:15.719
AND WE SEE THAT TIME AND TIME

00:44:15.786 --> 00:44:17.955
AGAIN. PARTICULARLY WITH-

00:44:18.022 --> 00:44:20.090
SPORTING ARENAS AND ATHLETIC

00:44:20.157 --> 00:44:22.092
TEAMS THAT THEY GET EXEMPTIONS

00:44:22.159 --> 00:44:24.161
THAT THE SMALLER GUYS JUST DON'T

00:44:24.228 --> 00:44:26.497
GET AND I JUST WONDER HOW LONG.

00:44:26.563 --> 00:44:29.199
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE. TO GIVE

00:44:29.266 --> 00:44:31.068
A HAND OUT. TO THE ONE

00:44:31.135 --> 00:44:32.836
PERCENTERS THE BIG CORPORATIONS

00:44:32.903 --> 00:44:35.105
OUT THERE AT THE EXPENSE OF THE

00:44:35.172 --> 00:44:36.607
SMALLER GUYS I THINK THERE IS A

00:44:36.673 --> 00:44:38.809
WAY- TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE

00:44:38.876 --> 00:44:40.711
WITHOUT- YOU KNOW TRAMPLING. ON

00:44:40.778 --> 00:44:42.713
THE SMALLER GUYS SO WITH THAT-

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:44.348

HAVE OF FOR WHATEVER THAT'S

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:13.023
WORTH BUT- I'M NOT. VERY

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:14.758
SYMPATHETIC TO THE COMPETITION

00:48:14.825 --> 00:48:17.928
ISSUE- ALSO HAVING BEEN A LOCAL

00:48:17.995 --> 00:48:19.263
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL AND SEEN

00:48:19.329 --> 00:48:21.398
SOME OF THE BATTLES TO. OF THE

00:48:21.465 --> 00:48:23.567

ANYBODY IN THIS INDUSTRY WOULD

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:32.109
OPPOSE SOMEBODY ELSE. BREAKING

00:48:32.175 --> 00:48:34.878
THROUGH- TO CREATE OPPORTUNITY I

00:48:34.945 --> 00:48:37.080
MEAN IT SEEMS TO BE AN INDUSTRY

00:48:37.147 --> 00:48:38.282
THAT'S UNDER SIEGE AND YOU'D

00:48:38.348 --> 00:48:39.616

ABOARD SAY THE MORE THE MERRIER

00:48:42.219 --> 00:48:43.687

00:48:43.754 --> 00:48:45.355
BECAUSE IT RE OPENS OUR

00:48:45.422 --> 00:48:48.859
INDUSTRY- SO THAT IS MY THINKING

00:48:48.925 --> 00:48:50.394

IN THAT- BUT I WOULD SAY ON THE

00:48:56.099 --> 00:48:58.168
HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION ISSUE

00:48:58.235 --> 00:49:01.138
ALSO ALONG WITH SOME OF MY SOME

00:49:01.204 --> 00:49:02.906
OF OUR COLLEAGUES HERE HAVING

00:49:02.973 --> 00:49:05.442
SERVED. A LONG TIME- YOU KNOW

DEALING WITH THE FEDERAL DOT AND

00:49:07.511 --> 00:49:09.613
HIGHWAY MINISTRATION SO FORTH I

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.748
THINK AT SOME POINT YOU NEED TO

00:49:11.815 --> 00:49:13.216
GO FURTHER THAN THESE AMENDMENTS

00:49:13.283 --> 00:49:15.485
ARE AT SUPPORT THIS TODAY. BUT

00:49:15.552 --> 00:49:17.421
TO REALLY REQUIRE AN

00:49:17.487 --> 00:49:20.257
AFFIRMATIVE. DOCUMENT OF SOME

00:49:20.324 --> 00:49:23.060
KIND OF FROM HOW IT MINISTRATION

00:49:23.126 --> 00:49:25.962
CONCURRENT WITH THE

00:49:26.029 --> 00:49:27.764
ESTABLISHMENT OF- OF THESE NEW

00:49:27.831 --> 00:49:30.267
BILLBOARDS I JUST DON'T TRUST

00:49:30.334 --> 00:49:31.401
EIGHT WE SAW WITH CHANGES OF

00:49:31.468 --> 00:49:33.303
ADMINISTRATION- OVER THE LAST

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:34.971
FEW YEARS COMMITMENTS THAT WERE

00:49:35.038 --> 00:49:37.007
MADE THAT WERE PULLED BACK IN.

00:49:37.074 --> 00:49:38.041
VERBAL COMMITMENTS THAT WERE

00:49:38.108 --> 00:49:39.910
MADE THAT WERE SOFTENED UP LATER

00:49:39.976 --> 00:49:41.745
ON AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO-

00:49:41.812 --> 00:49:44.648
AGES. WHAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE

00:49:44.715 --> 00:49:47.351
INTO. ASSUMING THAT- WILL ALL

00:49:47.417 --> 00:49:49.920
GET ANOTHER CHANCE TO VOTE ON

00:49:49.986 --> 00:49:52.289
THIS BILL AT SOME POINT- THAT-

00:49:52.356 --> 00:49:55.158
AND- YOU WOULD FEEL A LOT BETTER

00:49:55.225 --> 00:49:59.596
TO ME. TO NOT JUST. KEEP MOVING

00:49:59.663 --> 00:50:04.334

00:50:04.401 --> 00:50:09.306
YOU KNOW TO REQUIRE- PROOF OF

00:50:09.373 --> 00:50:11.508
THAT NON OBJECTION- FROM FROM

00:50:11.575 --> 00:50:13.110
THE FEDS BEFORE PROCEEDING AND I

00:50:13.176 --> 00:50:14.044
THINK THAT WOULD PROTECT

00:50:14.111 --> 00:50:15.278
EVERYONE INVOLVED INCLUDING THE

00:50:15.345 --> 00:50:17.314
PEOPLE THAT ARE INVESTING IN

00:50:17.381 --> 00:50:20.283
THESE BILLBOARDS IN- AT AND

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:21.251
WOULD SUIT CAN ONLY ASSUME AT

00:50:21.318 --> 00:50:25.088
SOME POINT- IT TURNS INTO- THE

00:50:25.155 --> 00:50:26.289

. I THINK THEY'RE THEY'RE YOU

KNOW. I THINK THE FIRST MINUTE

00:50:58.321 --> 00:51:00.624
USER ARE REAL- AND I THINK IF WE

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:01.792
WERE TO MAKE THE SIGN SMALLER

00:51:01.858 --> 00:51:03.493
THAT WOULD HELP- I KNOW THAT

00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:05.328
CALTRANS HAS BEEN IN THE MIDDLE

00:51:05.395 --> 00:51:06.863
OF A BIG BATTLE OVER SIGNS IN

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:08.832

AND- I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW I

00:51:12.469 --> 00:51:13.904
THINK THAT THE ENFORCEMENT IS

00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:15.972
GOING TO BE TOUGH. HI IN THIS

00:51:16.039 --> 00:51:17.507
WERE REALLY SMART ABOUT AND I

00:51:17.574 --> 00:51:19.576
WOULD ASK THAT THE AUTHOR-

00:51:19.643 --> 00:51:20.944
REALLY SPENT SOME TIME DIGGING

00:51:21.011 --> 00:51:23.280
INTO THAT ISSUE- INSURING I

00:51:23.346 --> 00:51:24.681
THERE'S GOOD ENFORCEMENT AND

00:51:24.748 --> 00:51:26.583
THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO RESPOND

00:51:26.650 --> 00:51:27.050
QUICKLY IF THE FEDERAL

00:51:27.117 --> 00:51:28.952
GOVERNMENT TRIES TO CLAMP DOWN.

00:51:29.019 --> 00:51:30.620
ON US BECAUSE I'M I'M CONCERNED

00:51:30.687 --> 00:51:32.422
ABOUT THE CERTAINLY STEP IN THE

00:51:32.489 --> 00:51:34.424
RIGHT DIRECTION AND I AND BY THE

00:51:34.491 --> 00:51:35.025
WAY I UNDERSTAND WE'VE BEEN

00:51:35.091 --> 00:51:37.060
ACTING IN THIS MANNER FOR A LONG

00:51:37.127 --> 00:51:38.495
TIME THIS BILL I'M JUST GOING TO

00:51:38.562 --> 00:51:39.896
CONTINUE THE EXISTING PRACTICE

00:51:39.963 --> 00:51:41.898
BUT I DO THINK AT SOME POINT

00:51:41.965 --> 00:51:43.133
WE'VE GOT TO PUT IN PLACE

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.401
MECHANISMS THAT ARE GONNA ALLOW

00:51:44.468 --> 00:51:46.203
US TO RESPOND QUICKLY. IF THE

00:51:46.269 --> 00:51:46.837
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DECIDES TO-

00:51:46.903 --> 00:51:49.973
INFOWARS- THEIR THEIR RULES AND

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:50.907
I DON'T THINK IT'S OUT OF THE

00:51:50.974 --> 00:51:53.410
REALM OF POSSIBILITY SO I JUST

00:51:53.477 --> 00:51:55.612
WOULD ASK THAT THE CHAIR IN THE

00:51:55.679 --> 00:51:56.746

ENSURE FOR BETTER ENFORCEMENT

00:52:01.218 --> 00:52:04.254
BECAUSE I DO THINK THERE'S- I

00:52:04.321 --> 00:52:05.522
THINK I THINK THIS IS THIS JUST

00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:10.160
CAN DOUBLE DOWN ON THE RISK THAT

00:52:10.227 --> 00:52:10.927
WERE ALREADY TAKING AT THE

00:52:10.994 --> 00:52:12.596
STATE. THANK YOU SENATOR ALAN

00:52:14.397 --> 00:52:15.765
SAYING- YOU KNOW THE THIS IS

00:52:15.832 --> 00:52:17.100

00:52:23.907 --> 00:52:24.407
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN MOVE

00:52:24.474 --> 00:52:26.877

00:52:26.943 --> 00:52:28.778
AMENABLE TO BOTH SIDES OF IN THE

00:52:28.845 --> 00:52:30.580
TIME BEING KNOWING THAT WE WOULD

00:52:30.647 --> 00:52:32.115
