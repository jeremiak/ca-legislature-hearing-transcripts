01:41:26.580 --> 01:41:27.414
EASILY BECOME PARTISAN AND I

01:41:27.481 --> 01:41:29.116
JUST WANT TO. EMPHASIZE HERE

01:41:29.183 --> 01:41:30.317
THAT THIS IS NOT A BILL THAT

01:41:30.384 --> 01:41:32.186
SAYS ANYTHING ABOUT WHO CAN HAVE

01:41:32.252 --> 01:41:33.120
A WEAPON UNDER WHAT

01:41:33.187 --> 01:41:34.488
CIRCUMSTANCES THEY CAN HAVE A

01:41:34.555 --> 01:41:36.156
WEAPON IT SIMPLY SPEAKS TO THE

01:41:36.223 --> 01:41:37.224
HEALTH IMPACTS OF GUN VIOLENCE

01:41:37.291 --> 01:41:39.293
IN WHAT WE DO ABOUT PEOPLE WHO

01:41:39.359 --> 01:41:40.160
HAVE BEEN VICTIMS. AND WE KNOW

01:41:40.227 --> 01:41:42.162
THAT 44% OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:43.664
VICTIMS ARE LIKELY TO BECOME RE

01:41:43.730 --> 01:41:45.065
VICTIMIZED IN THE NEXT FIVE

01:41:45.132 --> 01:41:46.967

01:41:47.034 --> 01:41:48.702
WE DO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

01:41:48.769 --> 01:41:50.003

01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:51.905

01:41:51.972 --> 01:41:52.973
I REALLY WANTED TO UNDERSCORE

01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:54.441
THAT. IN ALSO SAYS WE'RE ALREADY

01:41:54.508 --> 01:41:55.476

ALSO USE MEDICARE AND IT'S A WAY

01:42:04.284 --> 01:42:05.319
WE CAN SPLIT THE COST WITH THE

01:42:05.385 --> 01:42:07.020
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO WE CAN

01:42:07.087 --> 01:42:07.988
ACTUALLY SAVE RESOURCES FOR

01:42:16.129 --> 01:42:17.030
THOUSAND DOLLARS I THINK WE

01:42:17.097 --> 01:42:18.031
CALCULATED LAST TIME THAT IF

RESOURCES FOR TAXPAYERS IN THE

01:42:28.342 --> 01:42:30.277

COMMONSENSE BASIC SAFEGUARDS FOR

01:50:39.632 --> 01:50:42.302
OUR CHILDREN. AS A PARENT IT IS

01:50:42.369 --> 01:50:45.772
INCOMPREHENSIBLE HOW WE- DO NOT

01:50:45.839 --> 01:50:47.607
REGULATE OR OVERSEE DAY CAMPS

01:50:47.674 --> 01:50:49.843
BUT WE REGULATE AND OVERSEE

01:50:49.909 --> 01:50:51.978
CHILD CARE FACILITIES WHEN MY

01:50:52.045 --> 01:50:53.613
CHILDREN WERE INFANTS I REMEMBER

01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:56.216
BEING ABLE TO GO TO THE DATABASE

01:50:56.282 --> 01:50:58.651
THAT DSS AFFORD TO PARENTS TO

01:50:58.718 --> 01:51:00.854
LOOK AT COMPLAINTS AND PRIOR

01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:05.025
INCIDENTS OF- INJURY TO BE ABLE

01:51:05.091 --> 01:51:06.826
TO EXAMINE AS A PARENT. IF THE

FACILITY WAS SAFE FOR MY CHILD

01:51:09.696 --> 01:51:11.331
THAT WE CAN'T DO THAT FOR CAMPS

01:51:11.398 --> 01:51:14.200
IS JUST NONSENSICAL AND THIS

01:51:14.267 --> 01:51:16.069
BILL WOULD ALLOW PARENTS A LOT

01:51:16.136 --> 01:51:17.871
MORE TRANSPARENCY AN OPPORTUNITY

01:51:17.937 --> 01:51:19.105

01:51:19.172 --> 01:51:22.075
ABOUT CAPS- IT DOESN'T SET A

01:51:22.142 --> 01:51:23.176
CEILING IT REALLY SETS A FLOOR

01:51:23.243 --> 01:51:25.045
IT REALLY IS THE MOST BASIC-

01:51:25.111 --> 01:51:28.381
THAT WE CAN- WE CAN EXPECT FROM

01:51:28.448 --> 01:51:30.116
THE INDIVIDUALS ENTRUSTED TO

01:51:30.183 --> 01:51:32.685
CARE FOR CHILDREN WHEN MANY OF

01:51:32.752 --> 01:51:34.687
US ARE WORKING. I'M I THINK ONE

01:51:34.754 --> 01:51:36.823
THING I WANTED TO SAY AS WELL IS

01:51:36.890 --> 01:51:38.224
THAT. WE DON'T REALLY KNOW MR

01:51:38.291 --> 01:51:41.094
FORBES GAVE MANY EXAMPLES OF-

01:51:41.161 --> 01:51:42.629
INJURY AND HARM INCLUDING WHAT

01:51:42.695 --> 01:51:44.597
HAPPENED TO THEIR DAUGHTER- BUT

01:51:44.664 --> 01:51:45.932
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW THE SCOPE

01:51:45.999 --> 01:51:47.534
OF THE PROBLEM BECAUSE WE DON'T

01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:50.437
HAVE- A DATABASE OR RECORD

01:51:50.503 --> 01:51:51.871

REGISTRATION OR EVEN LICENSING

01:51:53.540 --> 01:51:55.375

INTO THIS ISSUE WILL BE ABLE TO

01:51:57.210 --> 01:51:58.078
SEE THAT THERE. THIS THE

01:51:58.144 --> 01:52:00.413
MAGNITUDE IN THE SCOPE IS FAR

01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:01.614

02:04:51.083 --> 02:04:53.586
THOSE ELEMENTS OF THIS ANALYSIS

02:04:53.652 --> 02:04:57.056

02:05:20.479 --> 02:05:22.348
THINK IT IS ALSO A TESTAMENT TO

SAY THAT LIFE DOES GO ON. AND IT

02:05:24.583 --> 02:05:27.186
IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE- FIGHT FOR

02:05:27.253 --> 02:05:29.588

MORE CONCERNING IS A RECENT

02:57:07.383 --> 02:57:08.751

THIS IS NO LONGER THEORETICAL

02:57:31.607 --> 02:57:32.041
UNFORTUNATELY IN THESE

CONSTITUTIONAL MUSTER. ACTIONS

03:00:25.681 --> 03:00:27.583
THAT- PENAL IN NATURE HAVE TO BE

03:00:27.650 --> 03:00:29.685
IN FORCE IN THE STATE WHERE THEY

03:00:29.752 --> 03:00:30.553
OCCURRED IN THE CRITICAL

03:00:30.619 --> 03:00:31.587
DISTINCTION THAT MAKES OUR OWN

03:00:31.654 --> 03:00:33.455
PENAL IS WHETHER A CLAIM

REMEDIES A PRIVATE INJURY.

03:00:35.391 --> 03:00:36.959
CALIFORNIA HAS A GOOD ARGUMENT

03:00:37.026 --> 03:00:39.061
THAT SPD'S PENAL BECAUSE IT

03:00:39.128 --> 03:00:40.429
LACKS A PERSONAL INJURY

03:00:40.496 --> 03:00:42.731

SURVIVORS OF ABORTION AND THEIR

03:01:33.782 --> 03:01:35.918
FAMILIES. THIS LEGISLATION WOULD

03:01:35.985 --> 03:01:37.686
PROHIBIT THE APPLICATION OF LAWS

03:01:37.753 --> 03:01:39.822
THAT AUTHORIZES CIVIL ACTION

03:01:39.888 --> 03:01:41.924
AGAINST PERSONS OR ENTITIES WHO

03:01:41.991 --> 03:01:45.594
SEEK PERFORM INDUCE AID OR ABET

CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA. I

03:01:51.166 --> 03:01:52.935
BELIEVE THAT ABORTION IS NOT IN

03:01:53.002 --> 03:01:54.336
THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STATE

03:01:54.403 --> 03:01:56.905
OF CALIFORNIA AND ITS CITIZENS

03:01:56.972 --> 03:01:59.375

03:01:59.441 --> 03:02:01.277
ABOUT THIS WITH SPECIFIC

03:02:01.343 --> 03:02:03.612
AUTHORITY BECAUSE I AM THE

03:02:03.679 --> 03:02:05.481
VICTIM OF A FAILED ABORTION.

03:02:05.547 --> 03:02:07.650
DATA REPEATEDLY SHOWS THAT

03:02:07.716 --> 03:02:08.517
ABORTION HARMS THE UNBORN

03:02:08.584 --> 03:02:10.552
CHILDREN BY TERMINATING THEIR

03:02:10.619 --> 03:02:12.488
LIFE STOPPING A VIABLE HEART

03:02:12.554 --> 03:02:14.256
BEAT. AND THE MOTHERS OF THOSE

03:02:14.323 --> 03:02:16.225
UNBORN CHILDREN WHO OFTEN

SUFFERED VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE

03:02:18.994 --> 03:02:20.129
SCARS FOR THE REST OF THEIR

03:02:20.195 --> 03:02:22.164
LIVES. ABORTION IS NOT HEALTH

03:02:22.231 --> 03:02:24.566
CARE AND WHEN I HEAR STATEMENT

03:02:24.633 --> 03:02:26.669
THAT ABORTION IS HEALTH CARE I

03:02:26.735 --> 03:02:29.038
ARGUE THE ONLY REASON THAT I AM

03:02:29.104 --> 03:02:31.173
ALIVE TODAY IS BECAUSE OF THE

03:02:31.240 --> 03:02:33.442

ABORTION PROCEDURE. NOW DOESN'T

03:02:40.949 --> 03:02:43.452
THAT SOUND STRANGE A LIFE WAS

03:02:43.519 --> 03:02:45.421
SAVED BECAUSE A DOCTOR FAILED.

03:02:45.487 --> 03:02:46.789
USUALLY WHEN A DOCTOR FAIL

03:18:12.347 --> 03:18:13.715
SENIOR POLICY ANALYST AT

03:18:13.781 --> 03:18:15.583
CONSUMER REPORTS WE APPLAUD THE

03:18:15.650 --> 03:18:17.285
ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR INTRODUCING

03:18:17.352 --> 03:18:19.120
AB TWENTY EIGHTY NINE BECAUSE IT

03:18:19.187 --> 03:18:20.388
WOULD GIVE CONSUMERS HE

03:18:20.455 --> 03:18:22.557
PROTECTIONS OVER THE PRIVACY OF

03:18:22.624 --> 03:18:23.224
INFORMATION COLLECTED BY MENTAL

03:18:23.291 --> 03:18:24.993
HEALTH APPS CONSISTENT WITH

03:18:25.059 --> 03:18:26.127
PROTECTIONS OVER THE PRIVACY OF

03:18:26.194 --> 03:18:28.863
SUCH DATA COLLECTED IN A MEDICAL

03:18:28.930 --> 03:18:30.098
SETTING. MORE PROTECTIONS ARE

03:18:30.164 --> 03:18:32.300
NEEDED BECAUSE THE COMPANY TÍNH

03:18:32.367 --> 03:18:33.901
PANDEMIC HAS LED TO HIGHER RATES

03:18:33.968 --> 03:18:35.570
OF DEPRESSION AND MENTAL ILLNESS

03:18:35.637 --> 03:18:37.171
BUT THE SAME TIME IT'S MADE IT

03:18:37.238 --> 03:18:38.673
HARDER TO OBTAIN CARE. MANY

03:18:38.740 --> 03:18:40.275
CONSUMERS HAVE TURNED TO MENTAL

03:18:40.341 --> 03:18:42.310
HEALTH APPS TO FILL THE GAP BUT

03:18:42.377 --> 03:18:43.111
BECAUSE THESE APPS ARE

03:18:43.177 --> 03:18:44.979
INCONSISTENTLY COVERED BY STRONG

03:18:45.046 --> 03:18:46.648
HEALTH PRIVACY LAWS LIKE HIPAA.

03:18:46.714 --> 03:18:49.183
IN CMA CONSUMERS ARE VULNERABLE

03:18:49.250 --> 03:18:50.351
TO THE INAPPROPRIATE DISCLOSURE

03:18:50.418 --> 03:18:52.153
OF THEIR INFORMATION SUCH AS

03:18:52.220 --> 03:18:53.288
WELL WHETHER THEY SUFFER FROM

03:18:53.354 --> 03:18:54.956
ANXIETY POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS OR

03:18:55.023 --> 03:18:57.258
EATING DISORDERS. CONSUMERS AND

03:18:57.325 --> 03:18:58.960
THERAPIST LIKE WE HAVE NO IDEA

03:18:59.027 --> 03:19:00.395
WHETHER THE DATA WILL BE

03:19:00.461 --> 03:19:01.863
ADEQUATELY PROTECTED WHEN USING

03:19:01.929 --> 03:19:03.631
A MENTAL HEALTH UP. SOME APPS

03:19:03.698 --> 03:19:05.300
COLLECT CONNECT CONSUMERS WITH

03:19:05.366 --> 03:19:06.501
LICENSED THERAPIST OVER VIDEO

03:19:06.567 --> 03:19:08.069
WHICH WOULD TYPICALLY BE COVERED

03:19:08.136 --> 03:19:09.904
BY HEALTH PRIVACY LAWS BUT- THE

03:19:09.971 --> 03:19:11.239
SAME APPS ARE SIMILAR SOUNDING

03:19:11.306 --> 03:19:13.007
ONES MAY PROVIDE ME TRACKING

03:19:13.074 --> 03:19:14.976
DIARIES THERAPY CHAT BOTS. OR

03:19:15.043 --> 03:19:15.977
ASK YOU TO COMPLETE A

03:19:16.044 --> 03:19:17.111
QUESTIONNAIRE ON YOUR MENTAL

03:19:17.178 --> 03:19:18.680
HEALTH SYSTEM SYMPTOMS WHICH

03:19:18.746 --> 03:19:22.083
TYPICALLY WOULD NOT BE COVERED

03:19:22.150 --> 03:19:23.351
BY HEALTH PRIVACY LAWS. THIS IS

03:19:23.418 --> 03:19:24.485
A PROBLEM BECAUSE CONSUMER

03:19:24.552 --> 03:19:26.587
REPORTS TESTING HAS FOUND THAT

03:19:26.654 --> 03:19:27.588
MENTAL HEALTH APPS SHARE

03:19:27.655 --> 03:19:28.189
INFORMATION ABOUT USERS WITH

03:19:28.256 --> 03:19:29.257
TECH COMPANY THE TRACK THEIR

03:19:29.324 --> 03:19:31.292
BEHAVIOR ACROSS OTHER APPS. THAT

03:19:31.359 --> 03:19:32.393
INFORMATION COULD BE USED TO

03:19:32.460 --> 03:19:34.529
TARGET ADS TO YOU BASED ON

03:19:34.595 --> 03:19:35.163
INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR MENTAL

03:19:35.229 --> 03:19:36.731
HEALTH CONCERNS. CONSUMERS

03:19:36.798 --> 03:19:38.232
SHOULD BE ABLE TO REACH OUT FOR

03:19:38.299 --> 03:19:39.467
HELP WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT HOW

03:19:39.534 --> 03:19:41.302
THEIR DATA MIGHT BE SHARED-

03:19:41.369 --> 03:19:42.870
MISCUES. WHILE IT'S TRUE THAT

03:19:42.937 --> 03:19:45.039
THE STATE IS COVERED BY- THE

03:19:45.106 --> 03:19:46.374
CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT

03:19:46.441 --> 03:19:48.109
THIS WAS NOT ADEQUATE TO PROTECT

03:19:48.176 --> 03:19:49.944
SUCH SENSITIVE HEALTH DATA. IT

03:19:50.011 --> 03:19:51.212
GIVES CONSUMERS THE RIGHT TO OPT

03:19:51.279 --> 03:19:53.081
OUT OF THE SALE OF THEIR

03:19:53.147 --> 03:19:54.182
INFORMATION BUT THIS BILL IS

03:19:54.248 --> 03:19:55.683
MUCH STRONGER BECAUSE IT WOULD

03:19:55.750 --> 03:19:56.551
PROHIBIT MOST CASES OF DATA

03:19:56.617 --> 03:19:58.653
SHARING. AT ALL AND THIS IS

03:19:58.720 --> 03:20:00.488
IMPORTANT BECAUSE MANY CONSUMERS

03:20:00.555 --> 03:20:01.689
AREN'T AWARE OF THEIR RIGHTS

03:20:01.756 --> 03:20:03.324
UNDER THE CCPA AND WON'T

03:20:03.391 --> 03:20:05.226
ACTIVELY REACH OUT TO STOP THE

03:20:05.293 --> 03:20:06.527
SELL THEIR INFORMATION. AND ALSO

03:20:06.594 --> 03:20:07.729
WE FOUND THAT EVEN WHEN

03:20:07.795 --> 03:20:09.397
CONSUMERS DO NOW AND TRY TO OPT

03:20:09.464 --> 03:20:11.265
OUT IT CAN BE DIFFICULT FOR THEM

03:20:11.332 --> 03:20:13.401
TO DO SO. FINALLY PROPOSITION

03:20:13.468 --> 03:20:14.836
TWENTY FOUR AMENDED THE CCPA TO

03:20:14.902 --> 03:20:16.404
EXPLICITLY SET A FLOOR NOT A

03:20:16.471 --> 03:20:18.139
CEILING ON THE MEASURE IT'S

03:20:18.206 --> 03:20:19.440
INTENDED TO BE STRENGTHENED. IN

03:20:19.507 --> 03:20:20.675
ORDER TO PROVIDE BETTER PROTECT

03:20:20.742 --> 03:20:21.776
CONSUMER PRIVACY AND THIS IS

03:20:21.843 --> 03:20:23.478
EXACTLY THE TYPE OF DATA THAT

03:20:23.544 --> 03:20:25.480
DESERVES GREATER PROTECTIONS.

03:20:25.546 --> 03:20:26.414
FOR THESE REASONS WE STRONGLY

03:20:26.481 --> 03:20:27.315
SUPPORT THE GOALS OF THIS

03:20:27.382 --> 03:20:29.083
LEGISLATION AND LOOK FORWARD TO

03:20:29.150 --> 03:20:30.151

PROTECTIONS. FOR CONSUMERS. AND

03:20:36.457 --> 03:20:38.393

03:21:28.409 --> 03:21:30.778

EVEN BE USED TO FURTHER

TO CARE OUR PROFESSIONAL

03:23:05.706 --> 03:23:07.808
CREDIBILITY IS ON THE LINE. WE

03:23:07.875 --> 03:23:09.343
WORK WITH INCREDIBLY SENSITIVE

03:23:09.410 --> 03:23:10.878

03:23:15.116 --> 03:23:17.018
DISCRIMINATION. WE DESERVE TO

IT'S DANGEROUS BEFORE THE AGE OF

RATHER THAN AT THE BROADER MORE

03:52:07.647 --> 03:52:10.516
SYSTEMIC SYSTEMIC ISSUES OF A

03:52:10.583 --> 03:52:11.550
FIFTY FIVE YEAR OLD PROGRAM THAT

HEARING ON THE L. P. S. ACT.

AFTER NEARLY NINE HOURS OF

03:52:24.263 --> 03:52:27.233
TESTIMONY AND DISCUSSION. IT WAS

03:52:27.300 --> 03:52:27.867
APPARENT THAT THE SYSTEM NEEDS

03:52:27.933 --> 03:52:29.568
ADDRESSING. MOST ALARMING WAS

03:52:29.635 --> 03:52:31.270
THE LACK OF CLARITY AND

03:52:31.337 --> 03:52:33.039
CONSISTENCY IN SOME BASIC ACTS

03:52:33.105 --> 03:52:34.707

WHERE THEY RESIDE OR HOW THINGS

ARE INTERPRETED. THE SECOND MOST

03:52:45.718 --> 03:52:47.520
ALARMING REVELATION WAS THE

03:52:47.586 --> 03:52:50.423
ALMOST COMPLETE LACK OF DATA.

03:52:50.489 --> 03:52:52.291
EITHER REAL TIME OR HISTORICAL.

03:52:52.358 --> 03:52:53.592

TO MY COMMITTEE ARE VERY

03:54:13.139 --> 03:54:15.141
SIGNIFICANT DUE TO

03:54:15.207 --> 03:54:16.108
INCONSISTENCIES IN

BEYOND WHAT THE STATUTE ACTUALLY

03:54:29.288 --> 03:54:31.424
ALLOWS. AND IN SOME INSTANCES

03:54:31.490 --> 03:54:33.225
THERE TREATED A LOT MORE FAIRLY

03:58:43.709 --> 03:58:45.544
CHAIR WOULD ENSURE STONE ARE ARE

03:58:45.611 --> 03:58:49.014
DOING WITH THIS BILL- I THOUGHT

03:58:49.081 --> 03:58:50.716
THE HEARING WENT OVER NINE HOURS

03:58:50.783 --> 03:58:52.284
IT WAS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE

03:58:52.351 --> 03:58:54.186
LONGEST LEGISLATIVE HEARINGS I

03:58:54.253 --> 03:58:56.021
HAVE EVER WITNESSED. AND IT WAS

03:58:56.088 --> 03:58:57.690
SUCH AN IMPORTANT REVIEW OF THE

03:58:57.756 --> 03:59:00.192
LAND TERMAN PETROUS SHORT ACT.

03:59:00.259 --> 03:59:04.296
AND AT THIS POINT I THINK IT'S

03:59:04.363 --> 03:59:06.465
IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT THIS

03:59:06.532 --> 03:59:08.701
BILL THAT THE PART THAT I'M

03:59:08.767 --> 03:59:10.936
GOING TO TALK ABOUT HIS. NOT SO

03:59:11.003 --> 03:59:13.706
MUCH THE DATA. BUT TO CLARIFY

03:59:13.772 --> 03:59:15.774
WHAT IT MEANS TO PUT SOMEONE ON

03:59:15.841 --> 03:59:19.178
A FIFTY ONE FIFTY A SEVENTY TWO

03:59:19.244 --> 03:59:21.180
HOUR HOLD. IT REALLY TREATS

03:59:21.246 --> 03:59:23.816
PEOPLE UNFAIRLY AND TAKES AWAY

03:59:23.882 --> 03:59:26.251
RIGHTS ACROSS COUNTY LINES

03:59:26.318 --> 03:59:27.853
DEPENDING ON WHICH FACILITY

03:59:27.920 --> 03:59:31.090
YOU'VE BEEN TAKEN TO AND HOW

03:59:31.156 --> 03:59:33.292
THINGS UNFOLD AFTER THAT. SO

03:59:33.358 --> 03:59:34.760
WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT

03:59:34.827 --> 03:59:37.963
CLARIFIES THAT THE SEVENTY TWO

03:59:38.030 --> 03:59:42.334
HOUR CLOCK. STARTS TO RUN. THE

03:59:42.401 --> 03:59:44.470
MOMENT YOU ARE DETAINED SEEMS

03:59:44.536 --> 03:59:46.972
LIKE A PRETTY SIMPLE CONCEPT BUT

03:59:47.039 --> 03:59:49.575
WHAT WE FIND IS IN REALITY IS

03:59:49.641 --> 03:59:53.245
THAT IF A PERSON IS TAKEN TO A

03:59:53.312 --> 03:59:55.981
FACILITY THAT IS NOT THE COUNTY

03:59:56.048 --> 03:59:58.484
DESIGNATED FACILITY. THEY MAY

03:59:58.550 --> 04:00:01.286
LANGUAGE THERE UNTIL A TRANSFER

04:00:01.353 --> 04:00:04.089
IS NAY IS ABLE TO BE AFFECTED

04:00:04.156 --> 04:00:06.158
AND SOMETIMES THAT COMES CLOSE

04:00:06.225 --> 04:00:08.427
TO OR EVEN PASSED THE SAID THE

04:00:08.494 --> 04:00:10.429
INITIAL SEVENTY TWO HOURS. WE'VE

04:00:10.496 --> 04:00:11.597
ALSO NOTICED THAT DIFFERENT

04:00:11.663 --> 04:00:14.266
COUNTIES TREAT THINGS ARE TREAT

04:00:14.333 --> 04:00:15.834
THESE KINDS OF SITUATIONS

04:00:15.901 --> 04:00:18.070
DIFFERENTLY SO MAYBE YOU'RE

04:00:18.137 --> 04:00:19.638
LUCKY IF YOU GET YOUR FIFTY ONE

04:00:19.705 --> 04:00:21.540
FIFTY AND ONE COUNTY RATHER THAN

04:00:21.607 --> 04:00:22.241
ANOTHER AND IT JUSTSIMPLY

04:00:22.307 --> 04:00:23.609
SHOULDN'T BE THAT WAY PEOPLE

04:00:23.675 --> 04:00:25.477
HAVE RIGHTS. AND THOSE RIGHTS

04:00:25.544 --> 04:00:27.546
ARE PROTECTED BY THE CALIFORNIA

04:00:27.613 --> 04:00:30.182
CONSTITUTION AND THE UNITED

04:00:30.249 --> 04:00:32.117

04:00:34.386 --> 04:00:36.955
WE SEE THIS AS AS A CLARIFYING

04:00:37.022 --> 04:00:38.457
CHANGE. AND WE ALSO BELIEVE

04:00:38.524 --> 04:00:42.995
THAT- BECAUSE THIS BILL CONTAINS

04:00:43.061 --> 04:00:44.997
. PROVISIONS TO ADDRESS WHAT

04:00:45.063 --> 04:00:47.900
HAPPENS IF IT'S IMPOSSIBLE AND

04:00:47.966 --> 04:00:50.435
BEYOND TO FACILITIES CONTROL. TO

04:00:50.502 --> 04:00:52.504

RIGHTS WILL ATTACH AT THAT POINT

04:00:57.376 --> 04:00:58.844

04:00:58.911 --> 04:01:00.746
