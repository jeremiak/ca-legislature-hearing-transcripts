I mean if the dissipating and

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:41.141
to our conversation is David.

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:43.209
For those who may not know this

00:00:43.276 --> 00:00:43.810
hearing on student success is

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:47.313
part of our- two year statewide

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.914
tour of college campuses now I

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:51.217
can hear that. Our Senate

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:52.986
committee on student success

00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:55.054
this is a- we've been we've

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:55.622
been engaged in a two year

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:58.958
effort going to college

00:00:59.025 --> 00:00:59.526
campuses throughout our our

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:01.161
wonderful state to explore

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.062
student needs in their ability

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.131
to succeed in the classroom.

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:07.300
Out last year earlier this

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:07.901
spring we visited Sacramento

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:11.204
state today we're here at the

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:11.838
mega sales tomorrow we're going

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:15.175
to be a Cal Poly Pomona. And

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:17.143
it's important that for those

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.479
of us in in the lawmaking world

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:21.214
that. We don't just to pass

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:23.316
laws and hope that they get

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:23.950
implemented but it's important

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:25.285
that we get in on the ground.

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:27.420
Experience and knowledge about

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:29.222
what's happening here. At the

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:31.524
mega cells in colleges around

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:32.125
our state and that and that's

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:33.359
why we're here. For me coming

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:35.295
back to this campus is a little

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:37.363
bit of deja vu I out loud I was

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.165
last here forty years ago.

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:39.699
Things have changed just a

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:43.069
little bit. I was a student

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:43.636
body president at San Diego

00:01:43.703 --> 00:01:45.505
state. And with that as a part

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:47.207
of the California state student

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:49.075
association we go to campuses

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:51.177
everyone to. Collaborate with

00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:51.845
our fellow students and got the

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:53.379
opportunity to come here to

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:55.181
Dominguez hills back then it's

00:01:55.248 --> 00:01:57.183
fun to come back. Right now.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.152
And another thing of note is

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.187
that up at least for me and I

00:02:01.254 --> 00:02:03.389
maybe from my colleagues as

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:07.126
well. I was double book today.

00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:07.760
That's like how did that happen

00:02:07.827 --> 00:02:09.462
will. Last week governor

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:11.097
Newsome's office called and

00:02:11.164 --> 00:02:11.664
said would you come to meet

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:12.265
with the governor this morning

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:15.368
in Sacramento and I said well I

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:17.270
kind of have a conflict.

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:19.072
Because we have this hearing.

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:21.441
And he said that I'm gonna sign

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:23.176
your bill. And what's the bill.

00:02:23.243 --> 00:02:23.676
Well together with my

00:02:23.743 --> 00:02:27.313
colleagues. We pass the largest

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.150
education bond bill ever put

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:31.751
forward in California out of

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:37.123
the Senate and the assembly.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.192
The governor the governor this

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:41.194
morning is signing it. And I

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:43.096
think it has it has been signed

00:02:43.162 --> 00:02:45.265
provided provides over six

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:47.300
billion dollars. For higher

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:49.168
education facilities in

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:51.237
California six billion dollars

00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:53.206
including two billion for the

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:53.806
California state universities

00:02:53.873 --> 00:02:55.375
which to make a sales. Is

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:59.178
eligible for a- but even with

00:02:59.245 --> 00:02:59.779
the governor's signature today

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:01.481
it's not a done deal that will

00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:03.182
appear on the March ballot

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:03.850
March primary ballot next year

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:05.585
and I know this isn't a time to

00:03:05.652 --> 00:03:07.220
talk about politics but I hope

00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:09.088
you'll pay attention to what's

00:03:09.155 --> 00:03:11.157
on your ballot. Next year. So

00:03:11.224 --> 00:03:13.526
the mission of the select

00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:15.261
committee on student success is

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:17.330
to gather experts together. For

00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:17.830
discussion not to push a

00:03:17.897 --> 00:03:21.401
specific agenda. But rather to

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:23.336
learn best practices and

00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:25.271
innovations to improve student

00:03:25.338 --> 00:03:27.273
success. And our focus is on

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.874
students and putting them on a

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:31.411
path to graduation. And we're

00:03:31.477 --> 00:03:31.978
focus not just on what's

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:33.413
happening in the classroom and

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:35.448
the ability to get through

00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:37.283
university with a degree were

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.185
also focusing. On hunger

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:41.554
housing and mental health

00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:43.423
issues. We know that if

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.592
students are able to take care

00:03:45.658 --> 00:03:47.293
of their basic needs that

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.860
they're not gonna do well to

00:03:47.927 --> 00:03:51.497
stay in school. And certainly I

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:53.366
am hoping that with our great

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:54.000
panel of experts are going to

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.501
hear from a few minutes that

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:57.403
will learn more about. How

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.904
that's happening here at

00:03:57.971 --> 00:04:01.474
Dominguez hills. I we have two

00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:03.309
campuses in the state the gist

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:03.876
of. Talk about the positive

00:04:03.943 --> 00:04:07.246
models that we have out there.

00:04:07.313 --> 00:04:07.880
A Sacramento state in San Jose

00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:11.217
state where their participation

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:11.751
for your grad program is

00:04:11.818 --> 00:04:13.519
extraordinary thousands of kids

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:15.488
are in that commitment every

00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:17.590
year. And their graduate at

00:04:17.657 --> 00:04:19.192
their graduation rates are

00:04:19.258 --> 00:04:21.728
going up. In in a wonderful way

00:04:21.794 --> 00:04:25.231
and. The chancellor's office I

00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:25.865
know we're gonna hear from them

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:27.266
in a few minutes with that Mr

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:29.469
gold. At least they're report

00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:30.103
shows that here at the mega

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:31.638
sells only about a hundred and

00:04:31.704 --> 00:04:33.306
twenty students are

00:04:33.373 --> 00:04:33.873
participating in that four

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.343
year. Graduation pathway I have

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.212
over thirteen thousand enrolled

00:04:39.278 --> 00:04:39.812
here and we want to understand

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:41.547
that issue we'll hear from the

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:43.383
chancellor's office to get us

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.385
perspective. And then we'll get

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:47.487
to digging down in the details

00:04:47.553 --> 00:04:49.355
here to make a sales. But I'm

00:04:49.422 --> 00:04:49.956
joined here by some wonderful

00:04:50.023 --> 00:04:53.259
colleagues in the legislature.

00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:53.860
I wanted to use them to give

00:04:53.926 --> 00:04:55.495
them a chance to make any kind

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:56.029
of interest introductory

00:04:56.095 --> 00:04:57.463
remarks that they like to make.

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.499
But on my left is senator Steve

00:04:59.565 --> 00:05:01.367
Bradford. Represents the magus

00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:03.336
hills is an alumni. Of this

00:05:03.403 --> 00:05:09.642
campus. Yeah that down we got a

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:13.479
de. We'll see is a great Holly

00:05:13.546 --> 00:05:14.113
here in the Senate been a great

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.314
advocate for a higher education

00:05:15.381 --> 00:05:15.782
institutions certainly

00:05:15.848 --> 00:05:19.318
Dominguez hills is that. De

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:23.389
near and dear to his heart and

00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:23.923
I want to welcome him and

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.490
invite him to make a remark

00:05:24.557 --> 00:05:25.591
she'd like to make. Thank you

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:29.228
senator Glazer and let's give

00:05:29.295 --> 00:05:29.796
him a round of applause for

00:05:29.862 --> 00:05:31.264
putting the store on and.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.433
Making college chicks us a

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:35.501
party and not just for the

00:05:35.568 --> 00:05:37.370
legislature but it should be

00:05:37.437 --> 00:05:37.970
for all of California to make

00:05:38.037 --> 00:05:39.639
sure that the young folks are

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:41.374
for older adults who choose to.

00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:43.509
Attend a university whether to

00:05:43.576 --> 00:05:45.445
see if you use C. or private

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:47.547
institution I have the means to

00:05:47.613 --> 00:05:49.449
succeed it's often. Assume

00:05:49.515 --> 00:05:51.451
simply because one might have a

00:05:51.517 --> 00:05:53.486
GPA might out with the

00:05:53.553 --> 00:05:55.321
scholarship or whatever it will

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:57.390
cover all your- expenses for

00:05:57.457 --> 00:05:58.057
college and that's the farthest

00:05:58.124 --> 00:05:59.625
thing from the truth what we

00:05:59.692 --> 00:06:01.527
found I have found out in the

00:06:01.594 --> 00:06:03.529
last year have. I have five

00:06:03.596 --> 00:06:07.567
colleges in my district you

00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:08.167
counted community colleges you

00:06:08.234 --> 00:06:11.738
count. To make a sales and I

00:06:11.804 --> 00:06:13.573
Jeff next is a little bit I've

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:14.207
Long Beach state. We have food

00:06:14.273 --> 00:06:14.807
pantries almost on all those

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:17.310
campuses and it speaks volumes

00:06:17.376 --> 00:06:17.910
to the fact that there are.

00:06:17.977 --> 00:06:19.612
Young folks going coming to

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:21.714
school on a daily basis home

00:06:21.781 --> 00:06:23.449
we're going home longer we also

00:06:23.516 --> 00:06:25.418
had a piece of legislation this

00:06:25.485 --> 00:06:27.653
year. Trying to allow students

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.655
to sleep in their cars on

00:06:29.722 --> 00:06:31.657
campus because again we're

00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:33.526
dealing with the number. Of

00:06:33.593 --> 00:06:35.495
homeless students here in

00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:37.597
California. Then I decided

00:06:37.663 --> 00:06:39.632
about. The new housing that

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:41.334
will be coming on cal state

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.968
Dominguez hills in the coming

00:06:42.034 --> 00:06:43.569
years because it's vitally

00:06:43.636 --> 00:06:44.203
important for far too long this

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.740
is pan team does a commuter.

00:06:47.807 --> 00:06:49.575
Campus and we want the students

00:06:49.642 --> 00:06:51.410
to have a real connection to

00:06:51.477 --> 00:06:51.978
the university and I think

00:06:52.044 --> 00:06:53.746
housing is part. Of that

00:06:53.813 --> 00:06:55.515
important role so I'm excited

00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:57.383
about the discussion today. And

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.452
I would just be back in sept

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:00.086
way on a piece of legislation

00:07:00.153 --> 00:07:03.422
that the governor of side. Last

00:07:03.489 --> 00:07:03.990
Monday my bill that I co

00:07:04.056 --> 00:07:07.326
authored with a- Nancy Skinner

00:07:07.393 --> 00:07:07.994
SP tools six. The fare paid to

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.531
play out and it's got a whole

00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:12.098
lot of discussion about why

00:07:12.165 --> 00:07:15.434
should we- allow young folks

00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:16.002
who are in college to play

00:07:16.068 --> 00:07:19.705
sports to monetize your name

00:07:19.772 --> 00:07:21.674
like this an image. Much for

00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:23.442
the same reason we're talking

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:24.076
have the discussion today just

00:07:24.143 --> 00:07:24.677
because you're a scholarship

00:07:24.744 --> 00:07:25.812
athlete. Doesn't mean you can

00:07:25.878 --> 00:07:27.713
cover all your expenses if in

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.749
college. College expenses is

00:07:29.816 --> 00:07:31.684
more intuition and books we

00:07:31.751 --> 00:07:32.251
have found even though for

00:07:32.318 --> 00:07:33.653
scholarship athletes many of

00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:35.521
them go to bed hungry on a

00:07:35.588 --> 00:07:37.523
daily basis. Don't have

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:38.157
spending money in their pocket

00:07:38.224 --> 00:07:39.759
so this is going to afford it

00:07:39.826 --> 00:07:41.694
so this is the nexus of dealing

00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:43.462
with. The high cost of college

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:44.030
not only in California but

00:07:44.096 --> 00:07:45.832
across the nation so I'm

00:07:45.898 --> 00:07:47.433
excited about the discussion

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.067
today. Look forty hearing from

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:49.535
all wrecks Richard. Right thank

00:07:49.602 --> 00:07:51.571
you Steven red laces on that

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:53.539
legislation that's a great

00:07:53.606 --> 00:07:55.575
accomplishment for. Our student

00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:56.142
athletes who I don't get the

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:57.877
respect and attention that they

00:07:57.944 --> 00:07:59.812
deserve. Another colleague in

00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:01.747
the Senate. Is here senator

00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:02.381
Archuleta. You where did you go

00:08:02.448 --> 00:08:07.453
to college. Rihanna and Bob

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:07.920
that was another great

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:08.521
supporter of higher education

00:08:08.588 --> 00:08:09.121
this year in the legislature

00:08:09.188 --> 00:08:11.591
voted for the- higher education

00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:12.191
by it's great to have you here

00:08:12.258 --> 00:08:12.825
Bob anything you want to say to

00:08:12.892 --> 00:08:15.428
welcome. See if this works.

00:08:15.494 --> 00:08:17.530
This work there is. Yes in my

00:08:17.597 --> 00:08:19.732
thirty second Senate district

00:08:19.799 --> 00:08:21.701
we have Biola. College Wiener

00:08:21.767 --> 00:08:23.636
college riddles college and

00:08:23.703 --> 00:08:27.540
real Honda college and- so. And

00:08:27.607 --> 00:08:29.508
I'm looking at this list. Of

00:08:29.575 --> 00:08:31.711
colleges in the rates that the

00:08:31.777 --> 00:08:35.481
graduation rates and- and I

00:08:35.548 --> 00:08:37.516
just think of so many of. My

00:08:37.583 --> 00:08:39.619
family members that went to

00:08:39.685 --> 00:08:41.554
some of the schools. But I

00:08:41.621 --> 00:08:43.723
guess I'm I come as a parent as

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:45.825
well. Because I have five

00:08:45.892 --> 00:08:47.727
children and they all obviously

00:08:47.793 --> 00:08:49.629
did well. At school I have one

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:51.530
son out of as C. one daughter

00:08:51.597 --> 00:08:52.031
out of pepper dying one

00:08:52.098 --> 00:08:53.900
daughter out of Jeff minute two

00:08:53.966 --> 00:08:55.701
sons out of west point. So they

00:08:55.768 --> 00:08:57.837
were able to get there degrees

00:08:57.904 --> 00:08:59.739
in the four years and so on.

00:08:59.805 --> 00:09:01.908
But my concern is the focus is

00:09:01.974 --> 00:09:04.010
up on the student's ability. To

00:09:04.076 --> 00:09:05.878
understand that they can

00:09:05.945 --> 00:09:07.713
achieve the same thing for

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.082
years. And my concern is are we

00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:11.918
getting the word out to the

00:09:11.984 --> 00:09:13.786
students. When we understand we

00:09:13.853 --> 00:09:16.022
have fourteen thousand students

00:09:16.088 --> 00:09:19.892
and rolled. We only have about

00:09:19.959 --> 00:09:23.596
two hundred in the program.

00:09:23.663 --> 00:09:24.196
It's something wrong here and

00:09:24.263 --> 00:09:24.797
we're not here to be punitive

00:09:24.864 --> 00:09:25.698
in any way shape or form but we

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:26.365
want to be informed and we want

00:09:26.432 --> 00:09:27.733
to be informative as well. And

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.902
you heard both my colleagues

00:09:29.969 --> 00:09:31.871
say that. The governor just

00:09:31.938 --> 00:09:33.739
signed a bill what money will

00:09:33.806 --> 00:09:35.875
be coming. So if money is going

00:09:35.942 --> 00:09:37.677
to be the issue Ben. It all

00:09:37.743 --> 00:09:38.244
that means that the future

00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:39.845
looks bright. That means that

00:09:39.912 --> 00:09:40.379
we're going to make these

00:09:40.446 --> 00:09:41.847
adjustments and I'm thinking

00:09:41.914 --> 00:09:43.616
that's what. I'm looking to

00:09:43.683 --> 00:09:45.618
hear and see that that cal

00:09:45.685 --> 00:09:47.787
state to make this is going to

00:09:47.853 --> 00:09:49.689
be part of the future. To open

00:09:49.755 --> 00:09:51.824
those dork bring these kids at.

00:09:51.891 --> 00:09:53.993
But as center Bradford had

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.895
mentioned. We have kids that

00:09:55.962 --> 00:09:57.730
obviously or sleep in their

00:09:57.797 --> 00:09:59.765
cars and have a- not even have

00:09:59.832 --> 00:10:01.934
a good meal for the- entire day

00:10:02.001 --> 00:10:04.003
so these are issues were looked

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:04.603
we've got to look at because

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:05.938
we've got to keep them healthy

00:10:06.005 --> 00:10:07.740
and strong and- be able to

00:10:07.807 --> 00:10:09.542
participate. And then of course

00:10:09.608 --> 00:10:11.844
a lot of drop off because they

00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:13.779
have family issues they want to

00:10:13.846 --> 00:10:15.548
support a family we understand

00:10:15.614 --> 00:10:16.182
that. But if we can and Senate

00:10:16.248 --> 00:10:18.050
in Senate died them in such a

00:10:18.117 --> 00:10:20.019
way and I don't know what that

00:10:20.086 --> 00:10:21.721
and Senate will be. But we've

00:10:21.787 --> 00:10:22.355
got to come together with the

00:10:22.421 --> 00:10:25.624
plan an idea. That they can see

00:10:25.691 --> 00:10:26.225
the future right around the

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:29.562
corner for years to come just

00:10:29.628 --> 00:10:30.129
like that and we want that

00:10:30.196 --> 00:10:31.897
success to be your success. So

00:10:31.964 --> 00:10:34.166
I'm here to listen to learn.

00:10:34.233 --> 00:10:35.801
And to participate anyway I can

00:10:35.868 --> 00:10:37.970
and I welcome the opportunity

00:10:38.037 --> 00:10:40.072
and certainly as a freshman

00:10:40.139 --> 00:10:41.841
senator. I am ready to

00:10:41.907 --> 00:10:43.843
participate anyway I can't

00:10:43.909 --> 00:10:45.578

00:13:34.146 --> 00:13:35.881
make sure that as I welcome our

00:13:35.948 --> 00:13:38.017
guests to the campus we are in

00:13:38.083 --> 00:13:41.820
a rare area of growth we'll

00:13:41.887 --> 00:13:42.388
talk talk about that in a

00:13:42.454 --> 00:13:43.822
couple minutes in my opening

00:13:43.889 --> 00:13:44.390
remarks. But I want to make

00:13:44.456 --> 00:13:46.058
sure that if you want to feel

00:13:46.125 --> 00:13:47.793
the love on campus as senator

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.795
Glazer felt today because he

00:13:49.862 --> 00:13:50.462
had teddy coming give him a hug

00:13:50.529 --> 00:13:52.097
and they took a selfie as soon

00:13:52.164 --> 00:13:53.933
as he came into the student

00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:55.801
union we want to make sure you

00:13:55.868 --> 00:13:56.468
use the right hand signal when

00:13:56.535 --> 00:13:57.803
you're on campus so we don't

00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:58.437
want to do Longhorns hook them

00:13:58.504 --> 00:14:00.139
or matadors who wanted to the

00:14:00.206 --> 00:14:02.241
Toro so it's got to have the

00:14:02.308 --> 00:14:03.976
snout on it so if you're on

00:14:04.043 --> 00:14:04.577
campus showing students love

00:14:04.643 --> 00:14:06.278
makes you're doing this in the

00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:08.113
background you get a lot of

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:08.747
love from our students in our

00:14:08.814 --> 00:14:09.982
community so welcome. As I said

00:14:10.049 --> 00:14:12.284
before this is an exciting time

00:14:12.351 --> 00:14:14.386
to be on our campus we are at

00:14:14.453 --> 00:14:16.155
an all time high in terms of

00:14:16.222 --> 00:14:18.190
our enrollment last year at

00:14:18.257 --> 00:14:20.059
this time we enrolled fifteen

00:14:20.125 --> 00:14:21.961
thousand seven hundred students

00:14:22.027 --> 00:14:25.998
as of census this year where it

00:14:26.065 --> 00:14:26.632
seventeen thousand twenty seven

00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:28.100
students on the campus of those

00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:30.202
students we have two thousand

00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:32.037
five hundred freshmen thirty

00:14:32.104 --> 00:14:33.939
three hundred transfer students

00:14:34.006 --> 00:14:36.141
and as you all know we have the

00:14:36.208 --> 00:14:38.110
most diverse school in the

00:14:38.177 --> 00:14:40.045
entire C. issue system. To give

00:14:40.112 --> 00:14:40.613
you some of the information

00:14:40.679 --> 00:14:42.414
here eighty two point 7% of our

00:14:42.481 --> 00:14:44.316
students and our freshman class

00:14:44.383 --> 00:14:45.918
are under represented minority

00:14:45.985 --> 00:14:49.989
students 73% Pell eligible 66%

00:14:50.055 --> 00:14:52.091
are first generation students

00:14:52.157 --> 00:14:52.691
at our universities this is

00:14:52.758 --> 00:14:54.326
critical about the needs of our

00:14:54.393 --> 00:14:56.295
students and I will tell you

00:14:56.362 --> 00:14:59.932
also that its key for us at cal

00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:00.532
state Dominguez hills because

00:15:00.599 --> 00:15:02.434
we are still for filling the C.

00:15:02.501 --> 00:15:04.203
issue mission which is about

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:08.240
access and. Completion also

00:15:08.307 --> 00:15:08.807
you'll notice me take a torn

00:15:08.874 --> 00:15:14.313
our campus. That were in a rare

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:14.847
place where we have new

00:15:14.913 --> 00:15:15.481
buildings that have been added

00:15:15.547 --> 00:15:16.115
to campus we have two academic

00:15:16.181 --> 00:15:16.615
buildings the first two

00:15:16.682 --> 00:15:17.216
academic buildings in twenty

00:15:17.283 --> 00:15:17.983
five years. On this campus. A

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:18.484
science and innovation

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:20.219
building. Which opens fall of

00:15:20.286 --> 00:15:22.254
twenty twenty just to our south

00:15:22.321 --> 00:15:24.223
here we have a brand new

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:25.924
innovation and instruction

00:15:25.991 --> 00:15:26.525
building that will be opening

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:28.327
in fall twenty one which will

00:15:28.394 --> 00:15:28.961
house our college of business

00:15:29.028 --> 00:15:31.930
administration public policy.

00:15:31.997 --> 00:15:32.631
And just as importantly we have

00:15:32.698 --> 00:15:34.066
new student housing that is

00:15:34.133 --> 00:15:36.135
slated to open in the spring

00:15:36.201 --> 00:15:38.103
twenty twenty one. Which is

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:39.938
going to have an additional

00:15:40.005 --> 00:15:40.406
five hundred beds. Our

00:15:40.472 --> 00:15:42.207
president is fond of saying

00:15:42.274 --> 00:15:42.775
that in order for us to be

00:15:42.841 --> 00:15:44.276
successful with students on

00:15:44.343 --> 00:15:46.078
campus we need need to make

00:15:46.145 --> 00:15:48.013
sure they spend more time on

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.948
campus. He has to find that as

00:15:50.015 --> 00:15:50.349
of waiting pinball

00:15:50.416 --> 00:15:52.284
interactions. It works with us

00:15:52.351 --> 00:15:52.818
with some of the students

00:15:52.885 --> 00:15:54.386
coming in the freshman class we

00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:55.954
have to describe what a pinball

00:15:56.021 --> 00:15:58.023
machine actually dot so we go

00:15:58.090 --> 00:15:58.624
through gyrations of showing

00:15:58.691 --> 00:16:00.159
how the ball works well works

00:16:00.225 --> 00:16:02.227
so forth. But I will tell you

00:16:02.294 --> 00:16:02.861
as you look at the campus and

00:16:02.928 --> 00:16:04.296
it is a significant day.

00:16:04.363 --> 00:16:06.165
Because assembly bill forty

00:16:06.231 --> 00:16:07.933
eight will wind up providing

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:08.567
much needed infrastructure for

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:10.336
our campus we have ninety

00:16:10.402 --> 00:16:11.937
million a hundred million

00:16:12.004 --> 00:16:12.571
dollars and need. To build up

00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:15.941
the infrastructure on campus.

00:16:16.008 --> 00:16:16.542
The other thing that I wanted

00:16:16.608 --> 00:16:17.943
to say is that we also have

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:19.945
invested quite a bit in our

00:16:20.012 --> 00:16:20.512
personnel on campus we are

00:16:20.579 --> 00:16:22.348
hiring about thirty tenure

00:16:22.414 --> 00:16:24.083
track faculty per year. We are

00:16:24.149 --> 00:16:25.951
improving the culture of non

00:16:26.018 --> 00:16:26.518
tenure track faculty on the

00:16:26.585 --> 00:16:28.187
campus to provide a lot of our

00:16:28.253 --> 00:16:30.055
instruction. And we're also

00:16:30.122 --> 00:16:30.622
building a culture of staff

00:16:30.689 --> 00:16:32.324
also in support for them. We

00:16:32.391 --> 00:16:34.293
also aspire to in the president

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.228
would say this if you were here

00:16:36.295 --> 00:16:38.230
we aspire to be a student ready

00:16:38.297 --> 00:16:40.132
university and if any of you

00:16:40.199 --> 00:16:40.699
have seen this a lot of the

00:16:40.766 --> 00:16:42.101
work that's coming out in the

00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:42.701
field. Is that instead of us

00:16:42.768 --> 00:16:44.336
talking about students being

00:16:44.403 --> 00:16:46.505
college prepared and career

00:16:46.572 --> 00:16:50.075
ready. We have to be. Student

00:16:50.142 --> 00:16:50.709
ready at our university and we

00:16:50.776 --> 00:16:52.244
think you'll find it to make a

00:16:52.311 --> 00:16:52.878
sells you hear from our panel

00:16:52.945 --> 00:16:54.313
of experts. We truly are

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.482
embracing this notion of being

00:16:56.548 --> 00:16:58.150
student ready. That means

00:16:58.217 --> 00:17:00.352
making sure that we are not

00:17:00.419 --> 00:17:02.054
putting it on the shoulders of

00:17:02.121 --> 00:17:02.621
students we're talking about

00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:04.390
how we better performance

00:17:04.456 --> 00:17:04.957
university to support those

00:17:05.023 --> 00:17:08.427
students. The three areas that

00:17:08.494 --> 00:17:09.061
we have a mission to in the cal

00:17:09.128 --> 00:17:14.233
state system I've been. The

00:17:14.299 --> 00:17:14.767
system thirty year. We've

00:17:14.833 --> 00:17:15.401
always been about access in the

00:17:15.467 --> 00:17:16.368
LA based. Right now just so you

00:17:16.435 --> 00:17:17.035
know we are the only one out of

00:17:17.102 --> 00:17:18.237
five C. S. U. campus is still

00:17:18.303 --> 00:17:18.871
open in terms of access. With

00:17:18.937 --> 00:17:20.472
the only non impact the campus

00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:22.408
in the LA basin of what this

00:17:22.474 --> 00:17:24.343
means is. That that that

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:24.943
students were placed balle the

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:26.478
Mingus hills is their choice

00:17:26.545 --> 00:17:28.447
for quality C. S. U. education.

00:17:28.514 --> 00:17:30.616
So much so that we recently had

00:17:30.682 --> 00:17:32.351
a redirection policy in the

00:17:32.418 --> 00:17:34.386
state. Where three hundred in

00:17:34.453 --> 00:17:34.853
addition three hundred

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.321
additional students came to our

00:17:36.388 --> 00:17:38.424
campus. As their choice when

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:38.991
they could not have another

00:17:39.057 --> 00:17:40.559
option in the LA basin this is

00:17:40.626 --> 00:17:42.227
significant for us. We also

00:17:42.294 --> 00:17:44.296
develop really strong inner

00:17:44.363 --> 00:17:46.131
segmental partnerships so.

00:17:46.198 --> 00:17:48.267
You'll know that we place on an

00:17:48.333 --> 00:17:50.068
average three hundred tutors

00:17:50.135 --> 00:17:50.636
out in Compton unified in

00:17:50.702 --> 00:17:54.139
Gardena valley as well. And we

00:17:54.206 --> 00:17:56.074
put those those students out

00:17:56.141 --> 00:17:56.608
there. Their undergraduate

00:17:56.675 --> 00:17:58.243
students working with local K.

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:00.145
through twelve classrooms. We

00:18:00.212 --> 00:18:02.281
also have mobile fab labs that

00:18:02.347 --> 00:18:04.316
were de donated by Toyota that

00:18:04.383 --> 00:18:04.883
we use to reach out to the

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:06.418
committee for stem education.

00:18:06.485 --> 00:18:08.454
And we have strong partnerships

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.088
with the committee colleges

00:18:10.155 --> 00:18:10.756
most notably El Camino college.

00:18:10.823 --> 00:18:12.291
Where we have a computer

00:18:12.357 --> 00:18:14.259
science collaboration. Only the

00:18:14.326 --> 00:18:16.094
second one in the state of

00:18:16.161 --> 00:18:16.728
California in the C. S. U. the

00:18:16.795 --> 00:18:18.530
other one being a moderate. The

00:18:18.597 --> 00:18:20.466
other thing we focus on is on

00:18:20.532 --> 00:18:22.134
completion and you'll hear a

00:18:22.201 --> 00:18:22.768
lot from the panel today about

00:18:22.835 --> 00:18:26.104
completion. Of certainly on the

00:18:26.171 --> 00:18:28.073
six metrics that we look at on

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:28.674
five of those six were making

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.275
good progress. On the six

00:18:30.342 --> 00:18:32.177
measure for your graduation

00:18:32.244 --> 00:18:32.811
will be talking about that. We

00:18:32.878 --> 00:18:36.081
are making progress moderates

00:18:36.148 --> 00:18:36.748
but progress to just make sure

00:18:36.815 --> 00:18:40.185
you have some level setting. In

00:18:40.252 --> 00:18:42.354
two thousand fourteen the four

00:18:42.421 --> 00:18:42.955
year graduation rate at this

00:18:43.021 --> 00:18:44.523
campus was five percent. This

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:48.193
past year it's risen now up

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:48.827
212% and we're on to projection

00:18:48.894 --> 00:18:50.696
it sixteen percent. In about a

00:18:50.762 --> 00:18:52.431
year from now. So our

00:18:52.498 --> 00:18:54.199
aspirations or if you think

00:18:54.266 --> 00:18:54.800
about that over five short

00:18:54.867 --> 00:18:58.203
years. We've tripled wrong the

00:18:58.270 --> 00:18:58.770
mark to triple our four year

00:18:58.837 --> 00:19:00.506
graduation rates. Something

00:19:00.572 --> 00:19:02.207
that is the present with safe

00:19:02.274 --> 00:19:02.808
use here we can do better we

00:19:02.875 --> 00:19:04.510
must do better for students to

00:19:04.576 --> 00:19:08.514
be out there. The second issue

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:09.114
for us the third issue for us

00:19:09.181 --> 00:19:14.353
actually is the only. With

00:19:14.419 --> 00:19:16.522
connected to. Completion is

00:19:16.588 --> 00:19:17.122
what we do to address student

00:19:17.189 --> 00:19:18.457
needs we are foremost among the

00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:19.091
C. issue campuses and providing

00:19:19.157 --> 00:19:19.658
something called affordable

00:19:19.725 --> 00:19:20.292
learning solutions and this is

00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:20.926
where we provide courses. At

00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:22.694
either low cost or no cost cost

00:19:22.761 --> 00:19:24.396
the students. We've been

00:19:24.463 --> 00:19:26.365
calculated of within the past

00:19:26.431 --> 00:19:28.534
year we have four hundred fifty

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.134
faculty that participate in

00:19:29.201 --> 00:19:30.536
this program the leader in the

00:19:30.602 --> 00:19:32.504
C. issue. And we save students

00:19:32.571 --> 00:19:34.406
close to a million dollars in

00:19:34.473 --> 00:19:34.973
terms of money they would

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.375
rather spend on course

00:19:36.441 --> 00:19:38.410
materials. I will channel the

00:19:38.477 --> 00:19:40.579
president for minute that's an

00:19:40.646 --> 00:19:41.113
applause line the million

00:19:41.179 --> 00:19:46.318
dollars. In terms of basic

00:19:46.385 --> 00:19:48.220
needs will talk about I did

00:19:48.287 --> 00:19:50.289
provide. A little graphic on

00:19:50.355 --> 00:19:50.956
the table there we will provide

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:52.491
these in the back. Cal state

00:19:52.558 --> 00:19:54.359
Dominguez hills been a

00:19:54.426 --> 00:19:54.960
partnership with apple their

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:56.528
enterprise system and we've

00:19:56.595 --> 00:19:58.297
developed the C. S. U. D. H.

00:19:58.363 --> 00:20:00.465
heats up. This app will be of

00:20:00.532 --> 00:20:02.301
use to all students across the

00:20:02.367 --> 00:20:02.968
campus and one of the things it

00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:04.369
does which is pretty

00:20:04.436 --> 00:20:06.405
revolutionary. Is that it sets

00:20:06.471 --> 00:20:07.039
it up so that any student on

00:20:07.105 --> 00:20:08.640
campus can find out when an

00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:10.409
event is taking place where

00:20:10.475 --> 00:20:12.210
food is being provided. And

00:20:12.277 --> 00:20:14.212
therefore can go to that event

00:20:14.279 --> 00:20:16.214
receive free meals free food

00:20:16.281 --> 00:20:16.815
and doesn't have to encounter

00:20:16.882 --> 00:20:18.350
the stigma of walking into a

00:20:18.417 --> 00:20:20.218
separate building on campus.

00:20:20.285 --> 00:20:22.287
This is innovative relates to

00:20:22.354 --> 00:20:22.955
the partnerships we do with the

00:20:23.021 --> 00:20:24.623
larger community. I want to

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:26.458
thank my comp my colleague got

00:20:26.525 --> 00:20:28.226
Chris my requests are vice

00:20:28.293 --> 00:20:30.429
president. Of information

00:20:30.495 --> 00:20:30.996
technology for champion this

00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:36.401
another applause line. And then

00:20:36.468 --> 00:20:37.035
the third area as I mentioned

00:20:37.102 --> 00:20:38.236
the C. issue system we've

00:20:38.303 --> 00:20:38.870
always been about access were

00:20:38.937 --> 00:20:40.339
now about completion with

00:20:40.405 --> 00:20:42.374
graduation innovation twenty

00:20:42.441 --> 00:20:42.941
twenty five. But in the C.

00:20:43.008 --> 00:20:44.643
issue Dominguez hills is the

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:46.478
leader in going to the third

00:20:46.545 --> 00:20:47.112
area that we haven't talked as

00:20:47.179 --> 00:20:50.248
much about. Which is thriving

00:20:50.315 --> 00:20:50.949
and in our system it's going to

00:20:51.016 --> 00:20:52.618
all be about thriving what

00:20:52.684 --> 00:20:54.586
happens to students after they

00:20:54.653 --> 00:20:56.555
graduate. We have a saying on

00:20:56.622 --> 00:20:57.122
campus are model was once a

00:20:57.189 --> 00:20:58.690
Toro always a Toro. So we're

00:20:58.757 --> 00:21:00.692
committed to lifelong learning

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:02.427
of our students we want to be

00:21:02.494 --> 00:21:02.928
able to provide Mike or

00:21:02.995 --> 00:21:04.630
certificates micro credentials

00:21:04.696 --> 00:21:06.732
badging. So that the student

00:21:06.798 --> 00:21:08.533
graduates from here five years

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.469
ten years fifteen years. Is

00:21:10.535 --> 00:21:11.069
going to be able to get re

00:21:11.136 --> 00:21:12.471
skilling upscaling to keep them

00:21:12.537 --> 00:21:14.539
on the job market and being

00:21:14.606 --> 00:21:16.241
resilience that's another thing

00:21:16.308 --> 00:21:16.875
that we're really committed to.

00:21:16.942 --> 00:21:18.577
And I would say without also if

00:21:18.644 --> 00:21:19.144
you saw recently in The New

00:21:19.211 --> 00:21:22.781
York Times. There was a review.

00:21:22.848 --> 00:21:24.816
About social mobility in the op

00:21:24.883 --> 00:21:26.785
crossed all colleges the United

00:21:26.852 --> 00:21:28.520
States. In the state of

00:21:28.587 --> 00:21:30.455
California Dominguez hills was

00:21:30.522 --> 00:21:32.491
ranked fourth out of a hundred

00:21:32.557 --> 00:21:34.593
sixty eight colleges. In terms

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.561
of so just for mobility this

00:21:36.628 --> 00:21:40.499
means upon graduating. Two or

00:21:40.565 --> 00:21:41.066
more quintiles and earnings

00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:42.701
after they graduate university

00:21:42.768 --> 00:21:44.670
for me that's the mark of

00:21:44.736 --> 00:21:46.571
success and something that we

00:21:46.638 --> 00:21:48.473
will continue to use again once

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.442
the Torah always a Toro. There

00:21:50.509 --> 00:21:51.043
many more things I was given

00:21:51.109 --> 00:21:52.678
five minutes so I've condensed

00:21:52.744 --> 00:21:54.646
a lot of it so we can get to

00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:56.448
our panel but it's our honor to

00:21:56.515 --> 00:21:57.049
have you on campus and I'll

00:21:57.115 --> 00:21:58.517
turn it back to you now senator

00:21:58.583 --> 00:22:00.452
Glazer. Thank you provost at

00:22:00.519 --> 00:22:02.387
great overview and your campus

00:22:05.023 --> 00:22:08.694
and learn from what you're

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.529
doing here as we learn from all

00:22:10.595 --> 00:22:12.397
the campuses that we visit. I

00:22:12.464 --> 00:22:12.931
wanna I welcome our first

00:22:12.998 --> 00:22:14.766
witness set that's gonna share

00:22:14.833 --> 00:22:16.535
their expertise with us today

00:22:16.601 --> 00:22:18.603
it's Jeff gold he's the

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:19.237
assistant vice chancellor for

00:22:19.304 --> 00:22:20.639
student success initiatives at

00:22:20.706 --> 00:22:22.441
the California State

00:22:22.507 --> 00:22:24.509
University. You have a global

00:22:24.576 --> 00:22:26.712
view of how we're doing around

00:22:26.778 --> 00:22:27.212
California not just the

00:22:27.279 --> 00:22:28.680
Dominguez hills view which

00:22:28.747 --> 00:22:30.549
you're gonna hear from and just

00:22:30.615 --> 00:22:32.617
a few minutes but- I would love

00:22:32.684 --> 00:22:34.386
for you to talk about the C. S.

00:22:34.453 --> 00:22:36.455
use graduation initiative the

00:22:36.521 --> 00:22:37.089
twenty twenty five targets that

00:22:37.155 --> 00:22:38.623
have been set. How we do and

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:40.392
where we go on right maybe

00:22:40.459 --> 00:22:42.494
where some places are we need

00:22:42.561 --> 00:22:43.028
improvement welcome circle

00:22:43.095 --> 00:22:46.732
fantastic. Thank you so much.

00:22:46.798 --> 00:22:47.332
Actually get real close in as

00:22:47.399 --> 00:22:50.869
well. I just want to start off

00:22:50.936 --> 00:22:51.470
by thanking you folks I mean

00:22:51.536 --> 00:22:52.070
especially as we were talking

00:22:52.137 --> 00:22:52.637
this morning senator Glazer

00:22:52.704 --> 00:22:53.138
about turning down an

00:22:53.205 --> 00:22:53.805
invitation from the governor to

00:22:53.872 --> 00:22:54.740
celebrate the signing of your

00:22:54.806 --> 00:22:56.742
bill. I think that says

00:22:56.808 --> 00:22:57.309
something to me should say

00:22:57.375 --> 00:22:58.744
something to everyone in this

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:00.479
room. The fact that you're all

00:23:00.545 --> 00:23:01.113
here giving this time the fact

00:23:01.179 --> 00:23:04.382
that this road show continues.

00:23:04.449 --> 00:23:04.883
From your many stops and

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:06.384
tomorrow you'll be at Pomona.

00:23:06.451 --> 00:23:08.386
It sends a signal to everyone

00:23:08.453 --> 00:23:08.987
in our office to everyone in

00:23:09.054 --> 00:23:10.589
the on our campuses but I think

00:23:10.655 --> 00:23:11.223
more importantly throughout the

00:23:11.289 --> 00:23:12.824
state of California. But this

00:23:12.891 --> 00:23:14.659
is important to you that you

00:23:14.726 --> 00:23:18.497
value this. And so just let's

00:23:18.563 --> 00:23:19.064
give the senators a big hand

00:23:19.131 --> 00:23:22.634
for their time can. So they get

00:23:22.701 --> 00:23:24.836
started I'm I'd probably take a

00:23:24.903 --> 00:23:26.638
step back quickly to just give

00:23:26.705 --> 00:23:28.406
us a little bit of context as

00:23:28.473 --> 00:23:30.609
many of you know. Three years

00:23:30.675 --> 00:23:32.410
ago we got together as a system

00:23:32.477 --> 00:23:34.412
with cross representative group

00:23:34.479 --> 00:23:36.414
from all campuses different.

00:23:36.481 --> 00:23:38.416
Positions within the campuses.

00:23:38.483 --> 00:23:38.950
To set some of the most

00:23:39.017 --> 00:23:40.685
ambitious goals. For completion

00:23:40.752 --> 00:23:42.754
inequity. We set goals so high

00:23:42.821 --> 00:23:44.790
that the CSU system is known as

00:23:44.856 --> 00:23:46.424
a public comprehensive

00:23:46.491 --> 00:23:48.527
university system. We aim to be

00:23:48.593 --> 00:23:50.629
first and best amongst our

00:23:50.695 --> 00:23:51.163
peers when it comes to

00:23:51.229 --> 00:23:52.497
graduation rates and equity. As

00:23:52.564 --> 00:23:54.499
proverbs back to mention we

00:23:54.566 --> 00:23:55.167
have always been known we take

00:23:55.233 --> 00:23:56.968
great pride in the fact that

00:23:57.035 --> 00:23:58.737
our student body. Our diverse

00:23:58.804 --> 00:24:00.806
student body. Medics and looks

00:24:00.872 --> 00:24:02.407
just like the great diversity

00:24:02.474 --> 00:24:02.974
in the state of California.

00:24:03.041 --> 00:24:04.709
Where we've needed to be much

00:24:04.776 --> 00:24:06.645
more intentional is with. The

00:24:06.711 --> 00:24:07.112
completion rates with.

00:24:07.179 --> 00:24:08.780
Facilitating the group that

00:24:08.847 --> 00:24:10.582
path to high quality degree

00:24:10.649 --> 00:24:11.183
fall of our students. And so

00:24:11.249 --> 00:24:14.419
right now as we fast forward

00:24:14.486 --> 00:24:15.020
three years from those states

00:24:15.086 --> 00:24:16.655
only set as ambitious goals.

00:24:16.721 --> 00:24:18.857
I'm thrilled to be able to

00:24:18.924 --> 00:24:19.391
report that we are doing

00:24:19.457 --> 00:24:20.859
tremendously well on almost all

00:24:20.926 --> 00:24:26.631
of our goals and let me explain.

00:24:26.698 --> 00:24:27.199
As a student in the C. S. C.

00:24:27.265 --> 00:24:27.799
when I see that there's some

00:24:27.866 --> 00:24:28.400
students the room today there

00:24:28.466 --> 00:24:29.034
has never been a better time.

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:30.635
To be at the C. S. C. with

00:24:30.702 --> 00:24:32.504
regards to student success. Let

00:24:32.571 --> 00:24:33.071
me say that again because I

00:24:33.138 --> 00:24:34.739
think it's so important. In the

00:24:34.806 --> 00:24:36.808
entire history of the C. S. U.

00:24:36.875 --> 00:24:38.777
there has never been a time

00:24:38.844 --> 00:24:40.545
when you were not more likely

00:24:40.612 --> 00:24:42.547
to graduate to succeed as a

00:24:42.614 --> 00:24:43.114
student then right now. And

00:24:43.181 --> 00:24:44.916
that doesn't happen by accident

00:24:44.983 --> 00:24:46.818
that happens because the

00:24:46.885 --> 00:24:48.520
intentionality. Happens I

00:24:48.587 --> 00:24:49.154
mention because you're willing

00:24:49.221 --> 00:24:50.956
to make this a top priority for

00:24:51.022 --> 00:24:52.591
yourself. That throughout our

00:24:52.657 --> 00:24:53.024
campuses whether its

00:24:53.091 --> 00:24:54.759
administrators faculty staff

00:24:54.826 --> 00:24:56.728
our presidents. Just as an

00:24:56.795 --> 00:25:00.532
example our trustees. Require

00:25:00.599 --> 00:25:01.199
every two months that they get

00:25:01.266 --> 00:25:02.801
an update on our graduation

00:25:02.868 --> 00:25:03.468
initiative they want to know in

00:25:03.535 --> 00:25:04.803
every single meeting.

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:06.705
Regardless of what's on their

00:25:06.771 --> 00:25:07.339
agenda they required an update

00:25:07.405 --> 00:25:08.874
for the grad initiative. If you

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:10.742
had been on campus I imagine I

00:25:10.809 --> 00:25:14.546
would almost be sure. A month

00:25:14.613 --> 00:25:15.146
and a half ago you would have

00:25:15.213 --> 00:25:15.714
heard present apartment as

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.717
complication. Talk about the

00:25:18.783 --> 00:25:19.251
graduation initiative get

00:25:19.317 --> 00:25:20.785
students dreaming from day one

00:25:20.852 --> 00:25:22.721
get faculty thinking from the

00:25:22.787 --> 00:25:23.355
beginning of the school year.

00:25:23.421 --> 00:25:24.623
Of the importance of

00:25:24.689 --> 00:25:25.290
completion. That happened here

00:25:25.357 --> 00:25:26.825
like it happened on twenty two

00:25:26.892 --> 00:25:28.627
other campuses. As we go

00:25:28.693 --> 00:25:29.227
through the arteries of the

00:25:29.294 --> 00:25:30.896
campus whether its faculty

00:25:30.962 --> 00:25:32.964
staff. Administrators we are

00:25:33.031 --> 00:25:34.866
all thinking and doing the same

00:25:34.933 --> 00:25:36.835
things. Being intentional about

00:25:36.902 --> 00:25:38.603
how we can better support our

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:40.839
students. And that's why we see

00:25:40.906 --> 00:25:41.473
the improvements with regard to

00:25:41.539 --> 00:25:44.709
the equity. I have to remind us

00:25:44.776 --> 00:25:46.544
that we are looking back. I'm

00:25:46.611 --> 00:25:50.916
somewhat. So it's almost like

00:25:50.982 --> 00:25:51.549
looking at the stars. In seeing

00:25:51.616 --> 00:25:54.853
them the. The reflectance

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:55.453
cutbacks for six years later.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:56.988
But we have made some really

00:25:57.055 --> 00:25:58.623
important progress. In terms of

00:25:58.690 --> 00:25:59.257
policy. So in terms of equity

00:25:59.324 --> 00:25:59.891
we have made about a one or two

00:25:59.958 --> 00:26:00.859
percentage point improvement

00:26:00.926 --> 00:26:01.459
for the first time in our act

00:26:01.526 --> 00:26:03.061
by closing Mike equity gaps of

00:26:03.128 --> 00:26:04.829
this last year. We have a lot

00:26:04.896 --> 00:26:06.731
more work to do there. But that

00:26:06.798 --> 00:26:08.566
comment about the stars is

00:26:08.633 --> 00:26:09.200
because when you look at what

00:26:09.267 --> 00:26:10.969
happened a year ago. As many of

00:26:11.036 --> 00:26:12.671
you know was the very first

00:26:12.737 --> 00:26:13.204
time in fact I think you

00:26:13.271 --> 00:26:14.940
highlighted the set your forum.

00:26:15.006 --> 00:26:16.841
At Santa Monica college about a

00:26:16.908 --> 00:26:18.710
year and a half ago. We changed

00:26:18.777 --> 00:26:20.745
as a system a policy that was

00:26:20.812 --> 00:26:22.614
unequal unfair to us a

00:26:22.681 --> 00:26:23.148
significant number of our

00:26:23.214 --> 00:26:24.649
incoming students. In

00:26:24.716 --> 00:26:25.317
particular students of color in

00:26:25.383 --> 00:26:26.885
low income students. And by

00:26:26.952 --> 00:26:28.920
doing that we got rid of with

00:26:28.987 --> 00:26:30.789
the stroke of a pen. The

00:26:30.855 --> 00:26:34.693
remedial education program that

00:26:34.759 --> 00:26:35.260
we had which basically said

00:26:35.327 --> 00:26:36.661
students at the same time.

00:26:36.728 --> 00:26:37.262
Welcome to this yes you work

00:26:37.329 --> 00:26:38.930
five year here. But if you

00:26:38.997 --> 00:26:40.665
don't jump through these hoops

00:26:40.732 --> 00:26:41.266
to finish these courses within

00:26:41.333 --> 00:26:46.571
a year. You're gonna. And so

00:26:46.638 --> 00:26:46.938
you can imagine

00:26:47.005 --> 00:26:47.605
disproportionately. Students of

00:26:47.672 --> 00:26:48.239
color low income students first

00:26:48.306 --> 00:26:48.807
generation students were in

00:26:48.873 --> 00:26:50.742
that group that was relegated

00:26:50.809 --> 00:26:51.242
to those courses. But I

00:26:51.309 --> 00:26:53.044
couldn't be more proud in fact

00:26:53.111 --> 00:26:54.946
I think for all of us in this

00:26:55.013 --> 00:26:56.781
room. This will be one of the

00:26:56.848 --> 00:26:58.850
most important. Policy changes

00:26:58.917 --> 00:27:01.019
for student success in the in

00:27:01.086 --> 00:27:03.021
our lifetimes. After one year

00:27:03.088 --> 00:27:04.789
of that policy change we're

00:27:04.856 --> 00:27:05.357
seeing that eight times the

00:27:05.423 --> 00:27:07.058
number of students of this last

00:27:07.125 --> 00:27:08.860
year. Within one year eight

00:27:08.927 --> 00:27:10.762
times the number of students.

00:27:10.829 --> 00:27:12.797
Were able to complete their

00:27:12.864 --> 00:27:13.298
general education math

00:27:13.365 --> 00:27:14.766
requirement in that very first

00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:16.801
year. So maybe in closing just

00:27:16.868 --> 00:27:17.369
at a high level what I've

00:27:17.435 --> 00:27:18.970
described is I often get asked

00:27:19.037 --> 00:27:20.972
in formal and informal

00:27:21.039 --> 00:27:23.041
sessions. How are you guys

00:27:23.108 --> 00:27:23.641
moving then you know how are

00:27:23.708 --> 00:27:26.845
you able to be successful with

00:27:26.911 --> 00:27:27.379
your system for its on the

00:27:27.445 --> 00:27:30.882
graduation initiative. I really

00:27:30.949 --> 00:27:31.416
have to two pieces of. Two

00:27:31.483 --> 00:27:32.751
responses to that question one

00:27:32.817 --> 00:27:33.284
as I've mentioned is that

00:27:33.351 --> 00:27:34.886
intentionality. Across the

00:27:34.953 --> 00:27:35.420
board from our external

00:27:35.487 --> 00:27:38.690
partners to state legislatures.

00:27:38.757 --> 00:27:40.825
To our our internal faculty

00:27:40.892 --> 00:27:42.894
staff administrators there's an

00:27:42.961 --> 00:27:43.428
unwavering commitment to

00:27:43.495 --> 00:27:44.963
student success in the

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:46.765
intentionality that goes with

00:27:46.831 --> 00:27:47.298
it. Number two is very

00:27:47.365 --> 00:27:49.067
important and I know it's early

00:27:49.134 --> 00:27:49.667
in the year to be mentioning

00:27:49.734 --> 00:27:51.102
this are talking about this.

00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:52.837
But student success is not

00:27:52.904 --> 00:27:54.873
free. A quick choirs money for

00:27:54.939 --> 00:27:56.775
us to launch the courses to

00:27:56.841 --> 00:27:57.409
support our students to higher

00:27:57.475 --> 00:27:59.044
the tenure track faculty. To

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:00.912
teach those courses to have the

00:28:00.979 --> 00:28:02.914
propria by users and the

00:28:02.981 --> 00:28:04.716
wonderful support structures

00:28:04.783 --> 00:28:05.283
that. Provost back in the

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:06.951
mentioned those are not free.

00:28:07.018 --> 00:28:09.120
And so we really appreciate the

00:28:09.187 --> 00:28:10.889
support of the state

00:28:10.955 --> 00:28:12.791
legislatures along with the

00:28:12.857 --> 00:28:13.391
governor's office to help us

00:28:13.458 --> 00:28:15.193
be. Where we are now which is

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.162
close to the full funding. Of

00:28:17.228 --> 00:28:18.997
the graduation initiative three

00:28:19.064 --> 00:28:22.700
years and- so with that about

00:28:22.767 --> 00:28:23.334
Beth final thank you I turn it

00:28:23.401 --> 00:28:25.136
back over to you right thank

00:28:25.203 --> 00:28:26.905
you doctor gold a couple of

00:28:26.971 --> 00:28:28.706
questions for me and I want to.

00:28:28.773 --> 00:28:29.274
Open up to my colleagues for

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:30.775
follow up as they see fit. As

00:28:30.842 --> 00:28:32.777
he talked about the change in

00:28:32.844 --> 00:28:33.378
remediation and we did hold a

00:28:33.445 --> 00:28:34.012
hearing on that and I was very

00:28:34.079 --> 00:28:35.046
pleased to see that policy

00:28:35.113 --> 00:28:36.781
change because I think it was

00:28:36.848 --> 00:28:38.950
discriminatory. At the same

00:28:39.017 --> 00:28:40.885
time we hear that the trustees

00:28:40.952 --> 00:28:42.720
are considering increasing.

00:28:42.787 --> 00:28:44.889
Math requirements could you

00:28:44.956 --> 00:28:47.092
address at that and maybe share

00:28:47.158 --> 00:28:48.993
your same thoughts about

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:49.594
whether or not. You think we

00:28:49.661 --> 00:28:50.829
may be heading now in a

00:28:50.895 --> 00:28:52.931
different direction. That that

00:28:52.997 --> 00:28:56.734
may have some affect on the-

00:28:56.801 --> 00:28:58.803
the fit is within our

00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:59.404
admissions yeah really. Really

00:28:59.471 --> 00:29:00.038
good question I think we lose

00:29:00.105 --> 00:29:01.239
a- really good question and so

00:29:01.306 --> 00:29:01.806
the question is really about

00:29:01.873 --> 00:29:03.007
what we're calling a

00:29:03.074 --> 00:29:04.742
quantitative reasoning

00:29:04.809 --> 00:29:05.376
requirement and it sounds like

00:29:05.443 --> 00:29:07.011
semantics changing the word

00:29:07.078 --> 00:29:07.545
from. Math quantitative

00:29:07.612 --> 00:29:09.114
reasoning but what we're

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:11.282
looking to do with our board in

00:29:11.349 --> 00:29:13.084
fact it'll go up for a vote

00:29:13.151 --> 00:29:13.651
next month and skews me too

00:29:13.718 --> 00:29:17.055
much. November is to ask that

00:29:17.122 --> 00:29:18.890
our high school students who

00:29:18.957 --> 00:29:20.825
come to us take an additional

00:29:20.892 --> 00:29:22.827
course in additional a three G.

00:29:22.894 --> 00:29:24.896
course. In something related to

00:29:24.963 --> 00:29:26.965
math so when of course but you

00:29:27.031 --> 00:29:27.599
know it can. Be to programming.

00:29:27.665 --> 00:29:33.271
Of. Course find a course for

00:29:33.338 --> 00:29:42.947
the such. And the idea. Not

00:29:43.014 --> 00:29:44.849
only of their of the entrance

00:29:44.916 --> 00:29:45.416
requirements. But also to

00:29:45.483 --> 00:29:47.318
become better prepared to enter

00:29:47.385 --> 00:29:49.120
into a discipline such as spam.

00:29:49.187 --> 00:29:51.289
So what we're seeing now we

00:29:51.356 --> 00:29:51.956
talk about equity gap says this

00:29:52.023 --> 00:29:55.059
binary. Gap between graduation

00:29:55.126 --> 00:29:56.995
rates between students. But if

00:29:57.061 --> 00:29:57.629
we were to look at the graph at

00:29:57.695 --> 00:29:59.130
the composition of students who

00:29:59.197 --> 00:30:01.065
are graduating and spam versus

00:30:01.132 --> 00:30:03.001
non stern for example. You see

00:30:03.067 --> 00:30:05.270
significant. Said significant

00:30:05.336 --> 00:30:07.105
variation in the students were

00:30:07.172 --> 00:30:09.073
eligible and go into those more

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.342
high paying. More sought after

00:30:11.409 --> 00:30:13.077
careers and so part of this

00:30:13.144 --> 00:30:15.146
initiative overall for the

00:30:15.213 --> 00:30:15.613
quantitative reasoning

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.182
requirement. Is to ensure that

00:30:17.248 --> 00:30:19.083
our students not only have an

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:19.651
equable chance when they

00:30:19.717 --> 00:30:21.252
answer. Once they enter they

00:30:21.319 --> 00:30:22.921
have an apple opportunity to

00:30:22.987 --> 00:30:23.488
choose a major. That will

00:30:23.555 --> 00:30:25.190
prepare them for the future. So

00:30:25.256 --> 00:30:28.960
there's no doubt that the whole

00:30:29.027 --> 00:30:29.594
stem areas a place you want to

00:30:29.661 --> 00:30:32.964
encourage student participation

00:30:33.031 --> 00:30:33.565
and success and for their sake

00:30:33.631 --> 00:30:37.068
and for California say. It's

00:30:37.135 --> 00:30:39.103
there are many degrees are

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:39.671
offered on a campus and non

00:30:39.737 --> 00:30:40.972
stem degrees. And I don't know

00:30:41.039 --> 00:30:43.041
what that proportion as- where

00:30:43.107 --> 00:30:43.575
that kind of quantitative

00:30:43.641 --> 00:30:45.243
reasoning really isn't going to

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:45.777
find their success here in

00:30:45.843 --> 00:30:48.980
college and in life. It's

00:30:49.047 --> 00:30:50.982
certainly at. That's a similar

00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:51.616
criticism of the standardized

00:30:51.683 --> 00:30:53.351
testing requirements were so

00:30:53.418 --> 00:30:55.286
much of it is based on your

00:30:55.353 --> 00:30:57.255
success in math. And yet in the

00:30:57.322 --> 00:30:59.224
humanities and political

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:01.292
science and sociology and so

00:31:01.359 --> 00:31:03.294
many other. Fields of degree

00:31:03.361 --> 00:31:05.230
that those those those just not

00:31:05.296 --> 00:31:07.198
it's valuable and certainly we

00:31:07.265 --> 00:31:08.967
want kids to have that well

00:31:09.033 --> 00:31:09.534
rounded education which our

00:31:09.601 --> 00:31:11.035
general education focuses on.

00:31:11.102 --> 00:31:13.204
For everyone. But our week

00:31:13.271 --> 00:31:17.108
again creating a gate. Rather

00:31:17.175 --> 00:31:18.977
than an open door for so many

00:31:19.043 --> 00:31:19.611
that just don't are dependent.

00:31:19.677 --> 00:31:21.145
Irrespective of your

00:31:21.212 --> 00:31:22.981
acknowledgement of how

00:31:23.047 --> 00:31:23.548
important and valuable stem

00:31:23.615 --> 00:31:27.285
students are. Yeah so I think

00:31:27.352 --> 00:31:28.987
that maybe before I answer that

00:31:29.053 --> 00:31:29.621
just the you know a little bit

00:31:29.687 --> 00:31:31.289
of clarification as that had we

00:31:31.356 --> 00:31:33.057
been looking to require for

00:31:33.124 --> 00:31:33.625
example that everyone take

00:31:33.691 --> 00:31:35.393
calculus or precalculus course.

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.495
I would completely agree with

00:31:37.562 --> 00:31:39.230
you however when we talk to the

00:31:39.297 --> 00:31:39.831
employers we go out to the

00:31:39.897 --> 00:31:41.399
community and that's one of the

00:31:41.466 --> 00:31:43.234
top skill sets the graduates

00:31:43.301 --> 00:31:45.003
require all of the mentioned

00:31:45.069 --> 00:31:45.570
this quantitative reasoning

00:31:45.637 --> 00:31:47.171
it's this financial literacy

00:31:47.238 --> 00:31:49.007
it's the ability to use numbers

00:31:49.073 --> 00:31:51.109
and logic. So we are not just

00:31:51.175 --> 00:31:51.709
to be clear talking about all

00:31:51.776 --> 00:31:53.411
students being required to take

00:31:53.478 --> 00:31:55.113
a calculus class were talking

00:31:55.179 --> 00:31:55.747
about them having additional

00:31:55.813 --> 00:31:57.348
practice. In that fluency with

00:31:57.415 --> 00:31:59.584
new numeracy that will help

00:31:59.651 --> 00:32:01.419
them second party question I

00:32:01.486 --> 00:32:03.054
think is a really important one

00:32:03.121 --> 00:32:03.721
and if you've been watching our

00:32:03.788 --> 00:32:05.456
board meetings and watching the

00:32:05.523 --> 00:32:07.125
community engagement. There's

00:32:07.191 --> 00:32:09.193
been a very lively and I think

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.162
hardening debate about this and

00:32:11.229 --> 00:32:12.997
the truth is we will never know

00:32:13.064 --> 00:32:15.066
exactly what will happen six

00:32:15.133 --> 00:32:15.733
years from now so the policies

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.502
that excuse me seven years from

00:32:17.568 --> 00:32:19.337
now in terms of access. Policy

00:32:19.404 --> 00:32:21.472
has a seven year window running

00:32:21.539 --> 00:32:25.076
up to it where we have the

00:32:25.143 --> 00:32:25.710
opportunity to get better help

00:32:25.777 --> 00:32:27.512
help create better partnerships

00:32:27.578 --> 00:32:29.347
with our case while partners to

00:32:29.414 --> 00:32:31.416
ensure that the very worried

00:32:31.482 --> 00:32:33.384
you have the concern that we

00:32:33.451 --> 00:32:35.486
share does not happen. And that

00:32:35.553 --> 00:32:37.221
window as we talk as we talk

00:32:37.288 --> 00:32:41.025
about preparing. Teachers and

00:32:41.092 --> 00:32:43.094
students as well for this new

00:32:43.161 --> 00:32:43.695
requirement that the next time

00:32:43.761 --> 00:32:45.296
we've also built in a kind of a

00:32:45.363 --> 00:32:49.000
do no harm clause so the idea

00:32:49.067 --> 00:32:51.135
is that you are. From an

00:32:51.202 --> 00:32:51.703
underserved school de in the

00:32:51.769 --> 00:32:53.438
fall you are not able to take

00:32:53.504 --> 00:32:55.006
those courses that I mentioned

00:32:55.073 --> 00:32:55.440
kind of the computer

00:32:55.506 --> 00:32:57.175
programming financial literacy

00:32:57.241 --> 00:32:57.809
or any type of science or math

00:32:57.875 --> 00:32:59.377
course. You you will not be

00:32:59.444 --> 00:33:03.081
held you'll be held harmless in

00:33:03.147 --> 00:33:05.016
terms of your ability to come

00:33:05.083 --> 00:33:11.155
to the C. issue. That Schering.

00:33:11.222 --> 00:33:11.723
Those thoughts in order I do

00:33:11.789 --> 00:33:17.161
watch all the trustee meetings.

00:33:17.228 --> 00:33:19.197
Yeah we are paying attention.

00:33:19.263 --> 00:33:19.864
Some of us. Let me also let me

00:33:19.931 --> 00:33:21.232
go now to. Another space which

00:33:21.299 --> 00:33:21.866
is. The in concert. He among

00:33:21.933 --> 00:33:22.500
the campuses on their four year

00:33:22.567 --> 00:33:23.468
into your trap programs. We're

00:33:23.534 --> 00:33:27.271
gonna talk about Tom and

00:33:27.338 --> 00:33:27.872
Gisele's in a few minutes but

00:33:27.939 --> 00:33:28.373
let's step away from the

00:33:28.439 --> 00:33:29.140
biggest fills. Data that you

00:33:29.207 --> 00:33:29.707
provided as it breaks down

00:33:29.774 --> 00:33:30.141
every campus that's

00:33:30.208 --> 00:33:30.641
participating there are

00:33:30.708 --> 00:33:31.242
significant differences. And

00:33:31.309 --> 00:33:33.311
some of them are very positive

00:33:33.378 --> 00:33:35.012
and encouraging like at

00:33:35.079 --> 00:33:37.115
Sacramento and San Jose and

00:33:37.181 --> 00:33:39.183
others like it cal state LA it

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:41.252
is just what's going on and

00:33:41.319 --> 00:33:43.121
that doesn't seem like. That

00:33:43.187 --> 00:33:45.123
that there's really commitment

00:33:45.189 --> 00:33:45.723
to the program and we're gonna

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:49.160
talk about that in terms of.

00:33:49.227 --> 00:33:49.794
The ability of a student even

00:33:49.861 --> 00:33:51.295
to know about that for your

00:33:51.362 --> 00:33:53.131
track and that's an issue I

00:33:53.197 --> 00:33:53.698
happen to make us cells and

00:33:53.765 --> 00:33:55.466
want to hear more on but- how

00:33:55.533 --> 00:33:57.201
are you tracking the

00:33:57.268 --> 00:33:59.170
consistency of application I

00:33:59.237 --> 00:33:59.670
know you say comes up a

00:33:59.737 --> 00:34:01.506
trustees meeting that's good.

00:34:01.572 --> 00:34:03.508
And as I understand it it's a

00:34:03.574 --> 00:34:05.143
part of the presidential

00:34:05.209 --> 00:34:05.777
reviews which is good. But how

00:34:05.843 --> 00:34:07.512
engaged are you conceding the

00:34:07.578 --> 00:34:09.480
advertising that's going on on

00:34:09.547 --> 00:34:11.382
the campus is just to have kids

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:13.317
get into the program let alone

00:34:13.384 --> 00:34:13.951
having to be successful within

00:34:14.018 --> 00:34:15.653
the program yeah that's a good

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.255
question and I think it's

00:34:17.321 --> 00:34:17.855
important to note that there

00:34:17.922 --> 00:34:19.657
are programs separate from the

00:34:19.724 --> 00:34:21.325
California problems promise.

00:34:21.392 --> 00:34:23.227
That aren't exactly the same in

00:34:23.294 --> 00:34:25.163
letter but they are for example

00:34:25.229 --> 00:34:25.797
Phoenician for type programmer

00:34:25.863 --> 00:34:29.167
complete into so before the

00:34:29.233 --> 00:34:29.767
legislation there were some

00:34:29.834 --> 00:34:31.436
campuses that were already you

00:34:31.502 --> 00:34:33.404
know reaching out and having

00:34:33.471 --> 00:34:35.406
these types of arrangements

00:34:35.473 --> 00:34:37.442
with their- with with their

00:34:37.508 --> 00:34:39.310
incoming students both freshman

00:34:39.377 --> 00:34:41.245
and transfers. And so I think

00:34:41.312 --> 00:34:43.214
that discrepancy really has to

00:34:43.281 --> 00:34:43.848
do with where folks are working

00:34:43.915 --> 00:34:45.483
offices are or they have been

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:49.153
it just takes awhile for them

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:51.289
to can okay message out there I

00:34:51.355 --> 00:34:53.624
know a colleague of mine was at

00:34:53.691 --> 00:34:57.395
the counter conferences for the

00:34:57.462 --> 00:35:01.699
entire. State of California for

00:35:01.766 --> 00:35:05.369
this do you. Just months. Five

00:35:05.436 --> 00:35:07.605
in caps there's talk. The

00:35:07.672 --> 00:35:08.172
college props and made sure

00:35:08.239 --> 00:35:09.540
that people knew counselors

00:35:09.607 --> 00:35:10.141
know that adviser it you too

00:35:10.208 --> 00:35:10.775
bye. To let them know that this

00:35:10.842 --> 00:35:11.642
opportunity exists. So I think

00:35:11.709 --> 00:35:12.276
that there's a couple things I

00:35:12.343 --> 00:35:12.910
think you're right to say that

00:35:12.977 --> 00:35:13.478
there's it unequal

00:35:13.544 --> 00:35:15.279
implementation of the

00:35:15.346 --> 00:35:15.913
California promised throughout

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:17.548
the state. And that you're

00:35:17.615 --> 00:35:19.350
seeing strong growth in some

00:35:19.417 --> 00:35:21.219
places and not as quick up

00:35:21.285 --> 00:35:23.254
taken others. But I also think

00:35:23.321 --> 00:35:23.855
that we need to look beneath

00:35:23.921 --> 00:35:25.590
that to see that. For students

00:35:25.656 --> 00:35:27.391
who don't check the box for

00:35:27.458 --> 00:35:27.992
California promise. There are

00:35:28.059 --> 00:35:29.660
other programs that are very

00:35:29.727 --> 00:35:31.529
similar and in fact. You don't

00:35:31.596 --> 00:35:33.664
provide stagnant talked about

00:35:33.731 --> 00:35:35.500
his graduation rates tripling

00:35:35.566 --> 00:35:36.100
over the last five years. As

00:35:36.167 --> 00:35:37.635
the system right now we are at

00:35:37.702 --> 00:35:39.670
about twenty five and a half

00:35:39.737 --> 00:35:40.238
percent having started at

00:35:40.304 --> 00:35:41.639
nineteen. Again none of us are

00:35:41.706 --> 00:35:43.774
proud and want to stand back on

00:35:43.841 --> 00:35:45.776
our laurels about where we are.

00:35:45.843 --> 00:35:47.812
But we have moved the way that

00:35:47.879 --> 00:35:49.347
we talk about graduation we

00:35:49.413 --> 00:35:51.282
have moved the way that we

00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.916
frame it and we have moved the

00:35:51.983 --> 00:35:53.651
way that. Our faculty or staff

00:35:53.718 --> 00:35:55.286
at our administrators

00:35:55.353 --> 00:35:59.423
especially advisors. Are are

00:35:59.490 --> 00:35:59.991
are having people. Get ready

00:36:00.057 --> 00:36:03.628
for that. Very good and I up

00:36:03.694 --> 00:36:04.262
when I go to my colleagues for

00:36:04.328 --> 00:36:05.429
their followers but- I

00:36:05.496 --> 00:36:06.097
encourage you to. As M. perhaps

00:36:06.163 --> 00:36:07.465
you do go to any campuses

00:36:07.532 --> 00:36:09.500
website. And say where do I

00:36:09.567 --> 00:36:11.369
find the Phoenician four or the

00:36:11.435 --> 00:36:11.969
cal promise whatever you wanna

00:36:12.036 --> 00:36:13.571
call it. How hard is it for me.

00:36:13.638 --> 00:36:15.673
To find that that program that

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:17.608
exists here. On a campus of I

00:36:17.675 --> 00:36:19.377
want to get through in four

00:36:19.443 --> 00:36:19.977
they're going to help me get

00:36:20.044 --> 00:36:21.412
through it for and I. I think

00:36:21.479 --> 00:36:22.046
if you take that challenge. You

00:36:22.113 --> 00:36:25.483
will be challenged. It will be

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:27.385
very difficult to find it here

00:36:27.451 --> 00:36:28.019
at to make a sells it takes six

00:36:28.085 --> 00:36:31.489
clicks. Six links to try to

00:36:31.556 --> 00:36:33.424
find the California promise

00:36:33.491 --> 00:36:35.593
program here to make the cells

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:36.227
and to make this hills is not

00:36:36.294 --> 00:36:37.595
unique in that. It just doesn't

00:36:37.662 --> 00:36:41.299
seem to be up the promotional

00:36:41.365 --> 00:36:43.301
efforts to inform kids that

00:36:43.367 --> 00:36:43.935
that I can see in you may be in

00:36:44.001 --> 00:36:45.570
a better position to see it but

00:36:45.636 --> 00:36:47.438
I. Encourage you to try to take

00:36:47.505 --> 00:36:47.972
that take that challenge.

00:36:48.039 --> 00:36:49.640
Senate artillery you had a

00:36:49.707 --> 00:36:51.409
follow up question yes thank

00:36:51.475 --> 00:36:53.311
you I'd like to acknowledge the

00:36:53.377 --> 00:36:53.945
provost because your- passion I

00:36:54.011 --> 00:36:55.746
could feel it. That you know

00:36:55.813 --> 00:36:57.648
where you're at and you realize

00:36:57.715 --> 00:36:59.750
you've got to get to that next

00:36:59.817 --> 00:37:01.652
level and I understand that

00:37:01.719 --> 00:37:03.454
like knowledge that. And you we

00:37:03.521 --> 00:37:05.556
can be successful if you don't

00:37:05.623 --> 00:37:07.291
realize that we're not

00:37:07.358 --> 00:37:07.792
successful and then to

00:37:07.858 --> 00:37:09.527
implement the plans and

00:37:09.594 --> 00:37:11.662
obviously the- the faculty the

00:37:11.729 --> 00:37:13.531
students all have to feed into

00:37:13.598 --> 00:37:17.702
that. Same yeah. But I would

00:37:17.768 --> 00:37:21.572
think you meet. Really have a-

00:37:21.639 --> 00:37:22.206
big punch in this thing. Is to

00:37:22.273 --> 00:37:23.574
reach out for the to your

00:37:23.641 --> 00:37:24.208
students. The ones are coming

00:37:24.275 --> 00:37:25.309
in from the community colleges.

00:37:25.376 --> 00:37:25.876
As if they've got two years

00:37:25.943 --> 00:37:27.378
invested they got two years ago

00:37:27.445 --> 00:37:29.313
you can immediately. Implement

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:31.315
a plan that'll get your right

00:37:31.382 --> 00:37:31.949
up there. Because these numbers

00:37:32.016 --> 00:37:33.718
are. Somewhat embarrassing to

00:37:33.784 --> 00:37:35.386
be quite honest with you. And

00:37:35.453 --> 00:37:37.455
thank god you're here. Because

00:37:37.521 --> 00:37:39.457
now you can change with every

00:37:39.523 --> 00:37:41.325
everyone here. And this could

00:37:41.392 --> 00:37:41.826
be the first step. To go

00:37:41.892 --> 00:37:43.661
forward. So I'm thinking and

00:37:43.728 --> 00:37:45.696
here's my question to you Mr

00:37:45.763 --> 00:37:47.732
gold. What what do you think

00:37:47.798 --> 00:37:49.634
you need to do to. To bring in

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:51.636
that goes to your students.

00:37:51.702 --> 00:37:53.738
That will help your numbers

00:37:53.804 --> 00:37:55.439
because we need to get these

00:37:55.506 --> 00:37:57.541
numbers up. And I know we got

00:37:57.608 --> 00:37:58.142
the issues pertaining to. To

00:37:58.209 --> 00:38:01.479
healthcare and food and- and

00:38:01.545 --> 00:38:03.414
how Jean everything else. But

00:38:03.481 --> 00:38:04.048
these to your students I think

00:38:04.115 --> 00:38:05.650
they're already on the path.

00:38:05.716 --> 00:38:07.418
What do you think yes we need

00:38:07.485 --> 00:38:07.985
that to your standard talk

00:38:08.052 --> 00:38:08.519
about communicable edge

00:38:08.586 --> 00:38:09.553
students who come here right.

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:11.689
And graduated to yeah I think

00:38:11.756 --> 00:38:15.726
so yeah. I think that we are

00:38:15.793 --> 00:38:17.428
already seeing it in our

00:38:17.495 --> 00:38:19.430
numbers at as a as a system. We

00:38:19.497 --> 00:38:21.465
set a goal at the time I

00:38:21.532 --> 00:38:23.634
believe our our to your I.

00:38:23.701 --> 00:38:25.770
tuition rates were about thirty

00:38:25.836 --> 00:38:27.705
percent. Or less for up to your

00:38:27.772 --> 00:38:29.807
transfers there now sitting at

00:38:29.874 --> 00:38:31.609
38% with the goal of forty

00:38:31.676 --> 00:38:33.544
five. So book I'm I hear your

00:38:33.611 --> 00:38:34.045
Senate I always in this

00:38:34.111 --> 00:38:35.479
uncomfortable position. Of I

00:38:35.546 --> 00:38:36.013
don't know some defensive

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:37.748
because not for a minute we

00:38:37.815 --> 00:38:39.583
think that forty five is the

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:40.217
end all be all we want that

00:38:40.284 --> 00:38:41.919
number be even higher. But in

00:38:41.986 --> 00:38:43.688
terms of setting a stretch goal

00:38:43.754 --> 00:38:45.523
of 45% of our students.

00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:47.625
Completing in two years were

00:38:47.692 --> 00:38:48.225
now sitting at about thirty

00:38:48.292 --> 00:38:49.527
eight in our preliminary

00:38:49.593 --> 00:38:50.194
numbers say that we're going to

00:38:50.261 --> 00:38:51.896
be this year so. We're just

00:38:51.962 --> 00:38:53.698
calculating and finishing

00:38:53.764 --> 00:38:55.633
calculating the graduation rate

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:56.167
data. For degrees through

00:38:56.233 --> 00:38:59.637
summer. And so that's why I was

00:38:59.704 --> 00:39:00.204
back to mention that he has

00:39:00.271 --> 00:39:01.939
some numbers are preliminary

00:39:02.006 --> 00:39:03.941
our preliminary numbers are

00:39:04.008 --> 00:39:09.847
telling us. They were to get

00:39:09.914 --> 00:39:15.586
even closer about forty five.

00:39:15.653 --> 00:39:17.621
We have room travel. I think it

00:39:17.688 --> 00:39:18.222
does take a little bit of time

00:39:18.289 --> 00:39:18.856
and we're seeing that happening

00:39:18.923 --> 00:39:19.790
now. For students to a at the

00:39:19.857 --> 00:39:20.357
community colleges be aware

00:39:20.424 --> 00:39:20.891
that this even exist we're

00:39:20.958 --> 00:39:21.625
seeing those numbers exist. And

00:39:21.692 --> 00:39:22.259
then on our end to arrange the

00:39:22.326 --> 00:39:22.860
curriculum in such a way that

00:39:22.927 --> 00:39:23.694
we facilitate every step of the

00:39:23.761 --> 00:39:24.328
way. For students to have that

00:39:24.395 --> 00:39:25.896
opportunity to complete in two

00:39:25.963 --> 00:39:27.631
years. Let me follow up on his

00:39:27.698 --> 00:39:29.533
chair. That we have the

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.902
interview process when they're

00:39:31.969 --> 00:39:33.537
coming in. About the exit

00:39:33.604 --> 00:39:34.071
process when you find a

00:39:34.138 --> 00:39:35.906
student. Who's about to say I

00:39:35.973 --> 00:39:37.975
can't handle it I don't have

00:39:38.042 --> 00:39:39.777
the patience I got to that they

00:39:39.844 --> 00:39:41.612
get. I mean the sit down and

00:39:41.679 --> 00:39:42.213
find out why. And how are we

00:39:42.279 --> 00:39:43.914
losing you. And what what

00:39:43.981 --> 00:39:45.950
should we have done differently

00:39:46.016 --> 00:39:47.551
you have do you have that

00:39:47.618 --> 00:39:48.219
process. Yeah I love it I would

00:39:48.285 --> 00:39:49.954
not in the system office

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:50.488
because we don't have the

00:39:50.554 --> 00:39:51.856
students there but many of our

00:39:51.922 --> 00:39:53.791
campuses are doing exactly what

00:39:53.858 --> 00:39:55.559
you're talking about and- not

00:39:55.626 --> 00:39:56.193
even. Not only that I should

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:58.028
say but when there are warning

00:39:58.095 --> 00:39:59.730
signs so sometimes when they

00:39:59.797 --> 00:40:01.565
already have left it's too late

00:40:01.632 --> 00:40:02.166
or they're about to leave. But

00:40:02.233 --> 00:40:03.968
a couple steps before when the

00:40:04.034 --> 00:40:05.836
signs are there that this is a

00:40:05.903 --> 00:40:07.571
Steven our data tell us. That

00:40:07.638 --> 00:40:09.640
the student is in danger of

00:40:09.707 --> 00:40:10.174
leaving we have proactive

00:40:10.241 --> 00:40:11.742
advising who read. Yeah but

00:40:11.809 --> 00:40:13.577
visor to reach out and say let

00:40:13.644 --> 00:40:14.145
me really better understand

00:40:14.211 --> 00:40:15.846
what's going on. You need to

00:40:15.913 --> 00:40:19.817
stand rolled. We need to do

00:40:19.884 --> 00:40:20.284
more to support it to

00:40:20.351 --> 00:40:23.721
graduation. Thank you. Okay Dr

00:40:23.788 --> 00:40:25.556

00:40:26.223 --> 00:40:26.757

sales as I understand it. I

00:40:45.776 --> 00:40:47.678
told you the university wide

00:40:47.745 --> 00:40:48.312
academic advisement testing and

00:40:48.379 --> 00:40:51.749

right. Thank you for your good

00:40:54.185 --> 00:40:55.786

00:40:55.853 --> 00:40:56.353
Northridge or some pattern

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:57.855
going on here. Were you served

00:40:57.922 --> 00:40:59.990
as a coordinator for freshman

00:41:00.057 --> 00:41:01.826
programs. Were you provided

00:41:01.892 --> 00:41:03.727
that counseling to first time

00:41:03.794 --> 00:41:05.663
freshmen. Dealing with academic

00:41:05.729 --> 00:41:07.832
and transitional issues and-

00:41:07.898 --> 00:41:08.332
and all the rest so we

00:41:08.399 --> 00:41:09.733
appreciate your expertise to

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:13.671
look for your testimony. Today

00:41:13.737 --> 00:41:14.271
thank you for being here. Well

00:41:14.338 --> 00:41:17.741
thank you so much for the

00:41:17.808 --> 00:41:18.342
opportunity to share our story

00:41:18.409 --> 00:41:20.044
with you. I know some of this

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:21.779
has already been surefire Provo

00:41:21.846 --> 00:41:23.747
stand by Jeff as well. But

00:41:23.814 --> 00:41:25.683
California state Dominguez

00:41:25.749 --> 00:41:26.317
hills is born from the struggle

00:41:26.383 --> 00:41:27.985
of the people that surrounded

00:41:28.052 --> 00:41:29.987
the area. And although the

00:41:30.054 --> 00:41:30.621
demographics of our local area

00:41:30.688 --> 00:41:33.757
have shifted. The content the

00:41:33.824 --> 00:41:34.391
community continues to reflect

00:41:34.458 --> 00:41:36.060
the struggle and the

00:41:36.126 --> 00:41:38.028
resiliency. A high percentage

00:41:38.095 --> 00:41:39.730
of our students as you heard.

00:41:39.797 --> 00:41:42.032
Falling to three high risk

00:41:42.099 --> 00:41:42.600
categories which is spelled

00:41:42.666 --> 00:41:45.970
recipients. Are in need of

00:41:46.036 --> 00:41:47.738
additional academic support.

00:41:47.805 --> 00:41:49.673
And belonged to historically

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:51.742
underserved population in

00:41:51.809 --> 00:41:53.711
addition to that as you heard.

00:41:53.777 --> 00:41:55.946
Percent of our students

00:41:56.013 --> 00:41:57.681
identify as first generation

00:41:57.748 --> 00:41:58.249
this is significantly higher

00:41:58.315 --> 00:42:01.719
than the C. S. U. overall.

00:42:01.785 --> 00:42:03.721
These all have been correlated

00:42:03.787 --> 00:42:06.090
with low completion rates in

00:42:06.156 --> 00:42:09.693
college. However this the

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.695
student characteristics are not

00:42:11.762 --> 00:42:13.898
barriers to college completion

00:42:13.964 --> 00:42:14.431
when appropriate academic

00:42:14.498 --> 00:42:15.833
supports are in place. Rooted

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:17.902
in our institutional mission we

00:42:17.968 --> 00:42:18.502
firmly believe in delivering

00:42:18.569 --> 00:42:19.870
transformational education

00:42:19.937 --> 00:42:22.006
experiences that emphasizes

00:42:22.072 --> 00:42:23.941
equity accessing inclusion for

00:42:24.008 --> 00:42:27.711
all students. We utilize these

00:42:27.778 --> 00:42:28.279
three quartermaster rate a

00:42:28.345 --> 00:42:29.947
holistic approach to supporting

00:42:30.014 --> 00:42:30.547
our strings that begins in the

00:42:30.614 --> 00:42:34.084
first year. Dominguez hills was

00:42:34.151 --> 00:42:35.686
one of forty four campuses

00:42:35.753 --> 00:42:37.821
selected to participate in ask

00:42:37.888 --> 00:42:39.890
use the association of American

00:42:39.957 --> 00:42:41.926
state colleges and universities

00:42:41.992 --> 00:42:43.694
reimagining the first year.

00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:45.796
That redesigned the first year

00:42:45.863 --> 00:42:46.230
of college to create

00:42:46.297 --> 00:42:48.032
sustainable change for student

00:42:48.098 --> 00:42:50.000
success. In two thousand

00:42:50.067 --> 00:42:51.902
fifteen Dominguez hills first

00:42:51.969 --> 00:42:53.904
year experience lunch also

00:42:53.971 --> 00:42:55.839
known as D. H. F. Y. E. and it

00:42:55.906 --> 00:42:58.008
provided all of our incoming

00:42:58.075 --> 00:42:59.843
freshmen an opportunity to have

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:01.812
a shared experience that

00:43:01.879 --> 00:43:02.279
included four points a

00:43:02.346 --> 00:43:03.948
proactive in intrusive

00:43:04.014 --> 00:43:06.083
advising. And that's fine your

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:08.018
mentor or coach appear in peer

00:43:08.085 --> 00:43:10.020
academic support in the form of

00:43:10.087 --> 00:43:11.822
tutoring and supplemental

00:43:11.889 --> 00:43:14.124
instruction that targeted are

00:43:14.191 --> 00:43:14.658
historically high D. of W.

00:43:14.725 --> 00:43:16.026
courses. A summer bridge

00:43:16.093 --> 00:43:16.627
experience and a connection to

00:43:16.694 --> 00:43:21.966
campus. At the forefront of all

00:43:22.032 --> 00:43:22.599
of this is our faculty who have

00:43:22.666 --> 00:43:24.068
supported who have stepped up

00:43:24.134 --> 00:43:25.970
to the challenge of re

00:43:26.036 --> 00:43:27.972
envisioning and re imagining

00:43:28.038 --> 00:43:30.007
the court the curriculum to be

00:43:30.074 --> 00:43:30.507
responsive inclusive and

00:43:30.574 --> 00:43:31.976
engaging. Studies have

00:43:32.042 --> 00:43:35.713
demonstrated the generation C.

00:43:35.779 --> 00:43:36.313
students appreciate practical

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:37.982
real life experiences. They

00:43:38.048 --> 00:43:39.817
want more hands on application

00:43:39.883 --> 00:43:40.317
of course work and are

00:43:40.384 --> 00:43:42.186
interested in applying them to

00:43:42.252 --> 00:43:42.653
social issues that are

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:45.956
important to them. At the

00:43:46.023 --> 00:43:47.825
Mingus hills faculty have maybe

00:43:47.891 --> 00:43:49.893
intentional effort to create

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:50.527
high impact practices such as

00:43:50.594 --> 00:43:53.831
the first year seminar or more

00:43:53.897 --> 00:43:54.465
commonly known on our campuses

confidence and resilience. At

00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:44.448
the same time we brought

00:44:44.515 --> 00:44:46.183
together a unified in cross

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:46.717
divisional team of faculty

Brokeback's to college

00:44:50.788 --> 00:44:54.024
completion. This team developed

00:44:54.091 --> 00:44:56.126
a pay it forward grant which is

00:44:56.193 --> 00:44:56.660
awarded to students were

00:44:56.727 --> 00:44:58.162
identified as having a specific

00:44:58.228 --> 00:44:58.762
remote requirement preventing

00:44:58.829 --> 00:45:03.934
them from graduating. Since

00:45:04.001 --> 00:45:04.568
twenty sixteen four hundred and

00:45:04.635 --> 00:45:05.235
thirty six awards were made to

00:45:05.302 --> 00:45:06.136
students who committed to

00:45:06.203 --> 00:45:08.205
completing this requirement and

00:45:08.272 --> 00:45:11.942
last spring or summer term. 86%

00:45:12.009 --> 00:45:14.011
of the students who were

00:45:14.078 --> 00:45:16.180
awarded. The pay it forward

00:45:16.246 --> 00:45:18.048
grant have completed and earned

00:45:18.115 --> 00:45:20.084
a their degree. This is a total

00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:22.252
of approximately four hundred

00:45:22.319 --> 00:45:23.954
and seventy thousand dollars.

00:45:24.021 --> 00:45:24.555
That have been funded by a our

00:45:24.621 --> 00:45:28.058
academic affairs budget. The

00:45:28.125 --> 00:45:28.659
remaining students all have

00:45:28.725 --> 00:45:30.427
been supported to develop an

00:45:30.494 --> 00:45:34.064
academic plan to move forward.

00:45:34.131 --> 00:45:34.565
The California promises

00:45:34.631 --> 00:45:36.266
instrumental in supporting the

twenty twenty five graduate

00:45:38.836 --> 00:45:42.372
initiative. Here on our campus

00:45:42.439 --> 00:45:44.074
known as a torrent Vassar

00:45:44.141 --> 00:45:46.376

Phoenician for and that through

00:45:47.077 --> 00:45:48.312
into. We've developed an

00:45:48.378 --> 00:45:50.247
intentional program that is

00:45:50.314 --> 00:45:52.149
high intensity and high touch

00:45:52.216 --> 00:45:54.017
and provide students with the

00:45:54.084 --> 00:45:54.651
opportunity to become involved

00:45:54.718 --> 00:45:56.286
on campus through high impact

00:45:56.353 --> 00:45:56.820
practices to help them be

00:45:56.887 --> 00:46:00.290
successful. This over to who

00:46:00.357 --> 00:46:01.959
stern Robert just a pie

00:46:02.025 --> 00:46:04.161
participate have one on one

00:46:04.228 --> 00:46:06.096
meetings with program

00:46:06.163 --> 00:46:06.697
coordinators to develop there

00:46:06.763 --> 00:46:08.065
to work for your plans. Meet

00:46:08.132 --> 00:46:08.665
regularly with the academic

00:46:08.732 --> 00:46:10.367
adviser they are connected to

00:46:10.434 --> 00:46:12.269
their faculty advisors and the

00:46:12.336 --> 00:46:14.404
major. They participate in

00:46:14.471 --> 00:46:16.206
service learning and research.

00:46:16.273 --> 00:46:18.242
And indeed with the career

center and the Torah learning

00:46:18.909 --> 00:46:21.979

00:46:22.045 --> 00:46:22.479
will participate in the

00:46:22.546 --> 00:46:23.046
California promise programs

00:46:23.113 --> 00:46:26.016
have tracked have been tracked.

00:46:26.083 --> 00:46:28.152
And the data suggest that our

00:46:28.218 --> 00:46:29.987
demonstrates I should say that

00:46:30.053 --> 00:46:30.621
students successfully complete

00:46:30.687 --> 00:46:32.089
their degrees and two or four

00:46:32.156 --> 00:46:32.723
years. And four are on track to

00:46:32.789 --> 00:46:36.026
do so. These students the

00:46:36.093 --> 00:46:37.961
student success initiatives

00:46:38.028 --> 00:46:38.562
that have brought together a

00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:40.264
committed faculty students

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:44.067
staff and administrators. Have

00:46:44.134 --> 00:46:44.601
been funded with one time

00:46:44.668 --> 00:46:48.272
funding. And we thank you the

00:46:48.338 --> 00:46:50.107
legislators and the

00:46:50.174 --> 00:46:50.674
chancellor's office for the

00:46:50.741 --> 00:46:58.182
support. For the support and

00:46:58.248 --> 00:46:58.749
supporting our stern success

00:46:58.815 --> 00:47:01.985
initiatives that have helped us

00:47:02.052 --> 00:47:02.519
achieve as the probe was

00:47:02.586 --> 00:47:06.056
mentioned and also Jeff our

00:47:06.123 --> 00:47:06.623
graduation rates as you have

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:07.124
seen on the mountain big

00:47:07.191 --> 00:47:10.294
building up in addition one

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:12.429
other significant move is the

00:47:12.496 --> 00:47:15.999
student mean unit load. That we

00:47:16.066 --> 00:47:16.600
have been projected for this

00:47:16.667 --> 00:47:18.502
term at thirteen point one.

00:47:18.569 --> 00:47:20.270
This is up from eleven in

00:47:20.337 --> 00:47:22.306
twenty in twenty fourteen.

00:47:22.372 --> 00:47:24.441
Given the enrollment growth C.

00:47:24.508 --> 00:47:26.176
S. U. DHS experience we're at a

00:47:26.243 --> 00:47:28.178
point in time we're we're

00:47:28.245 --> 00:47:29.980
taking a critical look at how

00:47:30.047 --> 00:47:31.982
to scale and sustain momentum

00:47:32.049 --> 00:47:33.984
that we have built. Part of

00:47:34.051 --> 00:47:34.518
looking at this is also

00:47:34.585 --> 00:47:36.220
insuring the well being of our

00:47:36.286 --> 00:47:38.255
students basic needs a mental

00:47:38.322 --> 00:47:40.090
health issue had mention. Thank

00:47:40.157 --> 00:47:40.657
you okay thank you doctor

00:47:40.724 --> 00:47:42.292
Figaro I appreciate the

00:47:42.359 --> 00:47:45.996
overview I a big fan of your

00:47:46.063 --> 00:47:46.563
first year seminar I'm a big

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:48.432
fan of your pay it forward.

00:47:48.498 --> 00:47:52.169
Grants and certainly I know I'm

00:47:52.236 --> 00:47:52.836
joined by my colleagues on the

00:47:52.903 --> 00:47:54.371
panel and doing everything we

00:47:54.438 --> 00:47:56.506
can to. Create more one time

00:47:56.573 --> 00:47:58.408
money or on going support and

00:47:58.475 --> 00:48:00.510
the seventy five million I

00:48:00.577 --> 00:48:02.479
think it was in the budget this

00:48:02.546 --> 00:48:04.014
year I was on top of the

00:48:04.081 --> 00:48:06.149
seventy five million. Before

00:48:06.216 --> 00:48:06.750
but let me ask you this and I

00:48:06.817 --> 00:48:12.122
know there's a person's.

00:48:12.189 --> 00:48:12.756
Chances office so we can't like

00:48:12.823 --> 00:48:13.323
have our own little private

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:16.326
conversation. If there was

00:48:16.393 --> 00:48:16.960
something that you feel a what

00:48:17.027 --> 00:48:17.561
are you not getting here. The

00:48:17.628 --> 00:48:17.995
cells with some very

00:48:18.061 --> 00:48:18.595
influential people here. On

00:48:18.662 --> 00:48:20.097
this panel what are you not

00:48:20.163 --> 00:48:20.664
getting that we can help you

00:48:20.731 --> 00:48:21.198
get that can make you more

00:48:21.265 --> 00:48:26.103
successful. So I think you know

00:48:26.169 --> 00:48:26.570
Jeff did mention right

00:48:26.637 --> 00:48:28.472
resources one time finding is

00:48:28.538 --> 00:48:30.107
great and we greatly appreciate

00:48:30.173 --> 00:48:32.309
it but it's about sustainable

00:48:32.376 --> 00:48:34.111
funding to continue the work

00:48:34.177 --> 00:48:36.346
that we have done what we did

00:48:36.413 --> 00:48:38.348
at Dominguez hills we did not

00:48:38.415 --> 00:48:40.183
have dedicated positions for

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:40.784
the Phoenician for or that

00:48:40.851 --> 00:48:44.254
they're going to we did receive

00:48:44.321 --> 00:48:46.123
the funding and we adjusted

00:48:46.189 --> 00:48:48.425
positions we tweaked position

00:48:48.492 --> 00:48:50.394
descriptions to be able to

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:52.296
support the work and what we

00:48:52.362 --> 00:48:54.231
need is really dedicated folks

00:48:54.298 --> 00:48:56.466
that are dedicated to the out

00:48:56.533 --> 00:48:58.402
reach into the support into out

00:48:58.468 --> 00:49:00.404
reaching also to our faculty.

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:02.272
Out you know because one piece

00:49:02.339 --> 00:49:04.107
is also the student outreach

00:49:04.174 --> 00:49:04.708
but it's also the faculty how

00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:06.576
do we engage the faculty in the

00:49:06.643 --> 00:49:08.412
process to build a these

00:49:08.478 --> 00:49:10.180
mentorship opportunities to

00:49:10.247 --> 00:49:10.647
build these coaching

00:49:10.714 --> 00:49:12.349
opportunities for students

00:49:12.416 --> 00:49:14.284
because we are also focusing

00:49:14.351 --> 00:49:16.219
not only in the two and four

00:49:16.286 --> 00:49:16.820
year graduation but we also

00:49:16.887 --> 00:49:18.221
want them to continue to be

00:49:18.288 --> 00:49:20.223
successful after the after they

00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:20.757
graduate with that that's

00:49:20.824 --> 00:49:22.526
graduate school or going back

00:49:22.592 --> 00:49:24.328
to what purpose Agnes said

00:49:24.394 --> 00:49:26.496
going into the into the private

00:49:26.563 --> 00:49:26.997
sector in in their own

00:49:27.064 --> 00:49:30.434
professional careers. So we're

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:31.068
gonna hear from the faculty in

00:49:31.134 --> 00:49:34.137
just a moment but the big

00:49:34.204 --> 00:49:34.771
question that I had coming here

00:49:34.838 --> 00:49:40.277
and still remains and. It's not

00:49:40.344 --> 00:49:40.877
just at when students get on

00:49:40.944 --> 00:49:42.279
the track they want to get.

00:49:42.346 --> 00:49:42.846
Four years or two years and

00:49:42.913 --> 00:49:43.480
what the university's doing to

00:49:43.547 --> 00:49:44.481
support that that all sounds

00:49:44.548 --> 00:49:46.216
great we really wonderful. But

00:49:46.283 --> 00:49:46.817
what surprised me most is how

00:49:46.883 --> 00:49:48.352
few students are. Making

00:49:48.418 --> 00:49:50.454
themselves available for that

00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:51.054
for your tracks because they

00:49:51.121 --> 00:49:54.124
don't know about it is because-

00:49:54.191 --> 00:49:56.126
they know about it added the

00:49:56.193 --> 00:49:56.626
thirteen thousand only a

00:49:56.693 --> 00:49:58.295
hundred say ow I care. You talk

00:49:58.362 --> 00:50:00.397
about the unit load being up

00:50:00.464 --> 00:50:02.366
which is a great indicator. Of

00:50:02.432 --> 00:50:04.368
a commitment to getting a

00:50:04.434 --> 00:50:06.636
degree. If the if the average

00:50:06.703 --> 00:50:08.505
degrees lotus thirteen point

00:50:08.572 --> 00:50:10.507
one that's close to a full time

00:50:10.574 --> 00:50:12.576
load. Here at university

00:50:12.642 --> 00:50:13.110
meaning they want to get

00:50:13.176 --> 00:50:14.478
through they're not just

00:50:14.544 --> 00:50:16.279
slacker it's and just coming

00:50:16.346 --> 00:50:16.913
here for a couple classes. The

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:18.749
book of the students here want

00:50:18.815 --> 00:50:20.417
to get through and still are

00:50:20.484 --> 00:50:22.452
not able to. And yet only

00:50:22.519 --> 00:50:26.656
handful of signed up for the-

00:50:26.723 --> 00:50:30.227
you know that the cal promise

00:50:30.293 --> 00:50:30.827
program so how do you explain

00:50:30.894 --> 00:50:31.395
that what's the reason for

00:50:31.461 --> 00:50:34.131
that. And so going back to what

00:50:34.197 --> 00:50:36.299
I have shared with you we did

00:50:36.366 --> 00:50:36.933
start the Dominguez hills first

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.635
year experience that is a

00:50:38.702 --> 00:50:40.637
program that all of our first

00:50:40.704 --> 00:50:42.239
year students participate in.

00:50:42.305 --> 00:50:42.739
This started before the

00:50:42.806 --> 00:50:46.343
California promise came onto

00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:48.245
our campus our transfer

00:50:48.311 --> 00:50:48.845
students are also engaged in

00:50:48.912 --> 00:50:50.247
the transfer learning

00:50:50.313 --> 00:50:52.249
community. And so with that our

00:50:52.315 --> 00:50:52.849
students although they're not

00:50:52.916 --> 00:50:54.584
participating in the California

00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:56.653
promise and one of the things

00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:00.290
that I think internally we are.

00:51:00.357 --> 00:51:00.957
Taking the time to reflect this

00:51:01.024 --> 00:51:02.692
how do we scale this up part of

00:51:02.759 --> 00:51:04.628
what I've shared with you is

00:51:04.694 --> 00:51:06.263
also having the appropriate.

00:51:06.329 --> 00:51:08.532
Human resources and funding to

00:51:08.598 --> 00:51:10.567
be able to help us find

00:51:10.634 --> 00:51:12.569
increase that. But our students

00:51:12.636 --> 00:51:14.571
are part of going back to also

00:51:14.638 --> 00:51:16.440
but Jeff said other initiatives

00:51:16.506 --> 00:51:18.241
that have been on our campus

00:51:18.308 --> 00:51:20.243
all students have participated

00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:20.877
coming in when do you Jeff I.

00:51:20.944 --> 00:51:22.746
E. transfer students have the

00:51:22.813 --> 00:51:26.249
opportunity to participate. In

00:51:26.316 --> 00:51:26.883
the transfer learning community

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:28.652
as well. So although that we

00:51:28.718 --> 00:51:30.587
don't see the big numbers in

00:51:30.654 --> 00:51:32.489
California promise as of now.

00:51:32.556 --> 00:51:36.326
There are other initiatives on

00:51:36.393 --> 00:51:38.261
our campus that are supporting

00:51:38.328 --> 00:51:40.363
our students. Well we're gonna

00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.897
hear from doctor Wallace's

00:51:40.964 --> 00:51:42.432
second I wanna throw props out

00:51:42.499 --> 00:51:44.434
his way because when I went to

00:51:44.501 --> 00:51:44.968
that too the student union

00:51:45.035 --> 00:51:46.703
today for lunch. And I saw all

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:48.672
those wonderful signs talking

00:51:48.738 --> 00:51:50.474
about mental health challenges.

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:56.346
And the stresses and strains. I

00:51:56.413 --> 00:51:56.980
thought man this is a campus OP

00:51:57.047 --> 00:52:00.383
did just put him up today. But

00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:02.686
this is a campus that gets it

00:52:02.752 --> 00:52:03.320
that it's not just about some

00:52:03.386 --> 00:52:04.488
you know isolated like. Try to

00:52:04.554 --> 00:52:05.088
find our connection this is

00:52:05.155 --> 00:52:05.655
like in your face. We care

00:52:05.722 --> 00:52:06.723
about you if you're feeling at.

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:08.692
This this is like. We have a

00:52:08.758 --> 00:52:12.362
warm embrace here. Out is that

00:52:12.429 --> 00:52:12.963
happening for the California

00:52:13.029 --> 00:52:14.598
promise Sir so I gotta get

00:52:14.664 --> 00:52:16.399
doctor Wallace to come in to

00:52:16.466 --> 00:52:17.033
the California promise program

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:18.568
here because- I'm feeling that

00:52:18.635 --> 00:52:20.270
connection on mental health.

00:52:20.337 --> 00:52:20.904
But I walk around the campus

00:52:20.971 --> 00:52:22.772
yes. And so all of our incoming

00:52:22.839 --> 00:52:24.641
students to hear about it on

00:52:24.708 --> 00:52:26.877
starting at orientation. It is

00:52:26.943 --> 00:52:28.712
shared with them during their

00:52:28.778 --> 00:52:30.714
orientation and follow up

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:32.716
workshops. On there also it

00:52:32.782 --> 00:52:34.584
also issued with them during

00:52:34.651 --> 00:52:36.386
during their advising

00:52:36.453 --> 00:52:38.622
appointments. So we do have

00:52:38.688 --> 00:52:39.256
various points where students

00:52:39.322 --> 00:52:42.459
are hearing it and we are

00:52:42.526 --> 00:52:43.059
sharing this information. I

00:52:43.126 --> 00:52:44.761
didn't know when you said that

00:52:44.828 --> 00:52:46.429
it took about six clicks on our

00:52:46.496 --> 00:52:48.832
website to find it. I know that

00:52:48.899 --> 00:52:50.901
as a university we have been

00:52:50.967 --> 00:52:52.636
looking to connect to

00:52:52.702 --> 00:52:54.504
continually improve the way

00:52:54.571 --> 00:52:56.439
that Google searches happen on

00:52:56.506 --> 00:52:57.073
our website. And so I know that

00:52:57.140 --> 00:53:00.477
that's something that we have

00:53:00.544 --> 00:53:01.077
undergone but I will go back

00:53:01.144 --> 00:53:02.646
and look at that. Occurs doctor

00:53:02.712 --> 00:53:04.648
figure I have the six clicks.

00:53:04.714 --> 00:53:06.616
Okay well. Then I can make a

00:53:06.683 --> 00:53:08.385
bad I can tell you how

00:53:08.451 --> 00:53:09.019
difficult it is to find really

00:53:09.085 --> 00:53:10.787
I can go through everyone. Just

00:53:10.854 --> 00:53:12.789
to find the California promise

00:53:12.856 --> 00:53:14.391
program it's almost impossible

00:53:14.457 --> 00:53:16.660
honestly it. And I if you don't

00:53:16.726 --> 00:53:20.830
have. This you you can go look

00:53:20.897 --> 00:53:21.364
it up and I guess I won't

00:53:21.431 --> 00:53:24.601
embarrass you by. But we've

00:53:24.668 --> 00:53:26.836
done that we looked at six and

00:53:26.903 --> 00:53:27.470
you have no idea even how to

00:53:27.537 --> 00:53:28.405
even get there you could even

00:53:28.471 --> 00:53:29.005
find it again there's no bread

00:53:29.072 --> 00:53:30.507
crumbs even finding these six.

00:53:30.574 --> 00:53:31.141
I hope that you'll look at that

00:53:31.207 --> 00:53:32.809
Jeff. It your students here and

00:53:32.876 --> 00:53:34.544
yes it's a diverse student

00:53:34.611 --> 00:53:36.580
body. And yes you have more

00:53:36.646 --> 00:53:37.180
Pell grant recipients and all

00:53:37.247 --> 00:53:40.383
the rest I get all that. They

00:53:40.450 --> 00:53:40.984
want to get through in four

00:53:41.051 --> 00:53:42.852
years or two years they want to

00:53:42.919 --> 00:53:44.688
get through it cost them more

00:53:44.754 --> 00:53:46.556
money. Thousands drop out

00:53:46.623 --> 00:53:48.592
because they can't. They want

00:53:48.658 --> 00:53:50.493
to get through here. There is a

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:51.161
narrative that has been used by

00:53:51.227 --> 00:53:52.796
some that says. There's all

00:53:52.862 --> 00:53:54.698
these barriers for students all

00:53:54.764 --> 00:53:56.633
these demands in their life

00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:57.267
they don't really want to get

00:53:57.334 --> 00:53:58.835
through now. That they want to

00:53:58.902 --> 00:54:00.737
get through here they want to

00:54:00.804 --> 00:54:01.338
get that degree because they

00:54:01.404 --> 00:54:02.639
know how valuable it is we got

00:54:02.706 --> 00:54:04.641
to make it easier for them and

00:54:04.708 --> 00:54:06.576
we do as a university recognize

00:54:06.643 --> 00:54:08.545
that we do have students on our

00:54:08.612 --> 00:54:10.413
campus. And most of them want

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:11.014
to get the route two and four

00:54:11.081 --> 00:54:12.816
years and we also recognize

00:54:12.882 --> 00:54:14.618
some of the students that. Will

00:54:14.684 --> 00:54:16.720
not take you to one four years

00:54:16.786 --> 00:54:18.755
and I think it does provide an

00:54:18.822 --> 00:54:20.423
opportunity for us to really

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:22.726
look at. The work that we're

00:54:22.792 --> 00:54:24.494
doing and how do we continue to

00:54:24.561 --> 00:54:25.161
scale the work that we're doing

00:54:25.228 --> 00:54:26.896
at Dodd S. center Archuleta

00:54:26.963 --> 00:54:28.431
asked a question about datum

00:54:28.498 --> 00:54:30.433
almond go. What kind of data

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:31.001
you collect he also asked a

00:54:31.067 --> 00:54:32.736
question. About the seniors

00:54:32.802 --> 00:54:34.671
that are so close a few classes

00:54:34.738 --> 00:54:36.873
away maybe one or two when you

00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:38.541
talk about the pay it forward

00:54:38.608 --> 00:54:40.410
grants. Can you address those

00:54:40.477 --> 00:54:41.044
two questions he asked earlier

00:54:41.111 --> 00:54:42.812
terms of what kind of data are

00:54:42.879 --> 00:54:44.781
you collecting about why kids

00:54:44.848 --> 00:54:46.416
are falling short whether

00:54:46.483 --> 00:54:47.050
dropping out what do what do

00:54:47.117 --> 00:54:50.420
you know that you can share. So

00:54:50.487 --> 00:54:52.789
we have of and a teen. Advice

00:54:52.856 --> 00:54:53.323
or or actually couple of

00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:56.526
advisers who are working on

00:54:56.593 --> 00:54:57.093
reaching out to the students

00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:58.428
that have left our institution.

00:54:58.495 --> 00:55:00.797
To one find out what why they

00:55:00.864 --> 00:55:02.999
have left our institution and

00:55:03.066 --> 00:55:04.634
more importantly if they're

00:55:04.701 --> 00:55:05.235
looking to come back to our

00:55:05.301 --> 00:55:08.538
institution what we have found

00:55:08.605 --> 00:55:09.105
it through those efforts it

00:55:09.172 --> 00:55:16.646
efforts is that. Many of. The

00:55:16.713 --> 00:55:17.247
students to leave because they

00:55:17.313 --> 00:55:20.650
have life. That happened. And

00:55:20.717 --> 00:55:22.452
dot just spins and then we talk

00:55:22.519 --> 00:55:23.053
about okay if your goal is to

00:55:23.119 --> 00:55:23.620
come back how do we get you

00:55:23.687 --> 00:55:24.788
back onto campus. We do have a

00:55:24.854 --> 00:55:25.422
returning Toros workshops that

00:55:25.488 --> 00:55:26.690
help students walking through

00:55:26.756 --> 00:55:27.357
the process of how to come come

00:55:27.424 --> 00:55:28.992
back and reactivate onto our

00:55:29.059 --> 00:55:30.960
campus. There are issues that

00:55:31.027 --> 00:55:32.796
we do find where it is

00:55:32.862 --> 00:55:34.531
financial and it's having that

00:55:34.597 --> 00:55:35.165
conversation with students and

00:55:35.231 --> 00:55:36.633
walking them through that

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:38.668
process so we are. In in the

00:55:38.735 --> 00:55:40.537
stages of collecting that data

00:55:40.603 --> 00:55:41.137
and you'll and I think them

00:55:41.204 --> 00:55:42.772
important pieces not only

00:55:42.839 --> 00:55:44.641
understanding why they have

00:55:44.708 --> 00:55:45.308
left and how to help. Them come

00:55:45.375 --> 00:55:47.010
back. But it's also being able

00:55:47.077 --> 00:55:48.912
to use that information to

00:55:48.978 --> 00:55:50.947
prevent future students. From

00:55:51.014 --> 00:55:52.982
leaving if we know that these

00:55:53.049 --> 00:55:53.583
are the situations that our

00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:54.918
students are encountering how

00:55:54.984 --> 00:55:56.886
do we- how do we prevent that

00:55:56.953 --> 00:55:58.555
from happening moving forward.

00:55:58.621 --> 00:56:00.557
And then the second question

00:56:00.623 --> 00:56:01.124
I'm sorry what was the- the

00:56:01.191 --> 00:56:04.661
data. And then that those that

00:56:04.728 --> 00:56:05.228
are so close. A classic two

00:56:05.295 --> 00:56:06.763
away sides the pay it forward

00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:07.297
brands anything else that

00:56:07.363 --> 00:56:08.898
you're doing to. Identify those

00:56:08.965 --> 00:56:10.967
seniors that. Are right on the

00:56:11.034 --> 00:56:12.936
verge. And I think that our

00:56:13.002 --> 00:56:14.938
graduation initiative team of.

00:56:15.004 --> 00:56:16.906
Our graduation and an

00:56:16.973 --> 00:56:18.908
innovation team is the group

00:56:18.975 --> 00:56:20.744
that again. Came up with the

00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:22.645
fate the pair we develop the

00:56:22.712 --> 00:56:23.246
pay it forward grant and that

00:56:23.313 --> 00:56:24.914
team meets once a month. To

00:56:24.981 --> 00:56:28.551
really identify those students

00:56:28.618 --> 00:56:32.822
that are on. The cusp right

00:56:32.889 --> 00:56:33.423
that they have one requirement

00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:38.895
one class. In it's not just

00:56:38.962 --> 00:56:39.529
about identifying the students

00:56:39.596 --> 00:56:40.563
but it's about how do we

00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:41.197
support that students in a lot

00:56:41.264 --> 00:56:41.765
of cases is that one class.

00:56:41.831 --> 00:56:42.665
That is only offered. Every

00:56:42.732 --> 00:56:43.299
spring semester and were in the

00:56:43.366 --> 00:56:44.567
fall semester right so how do

00:56:44.634 --> 00:56:46.669
we work. With the student with

00:56:46.736 --> 00:56:48.571
the colleges with their chairs

00:56:48.638 --> 00:56:49.172
or where there are with their

00:56:49.239 --> 00:56:50.774
majors. To be able to support

00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:52.675
the student and completing that

00:56:52.742 --> 00:56:54.677
degree so this does happen this

00:56:54.744 --> 00:56:55.245
team comes together once a

00:56:55.311 --> 00:56:56.946
month. To review some of the

00:56:57.013 --> 00:56:58.848
student cases and more

00:56:58.915 --> 00:57:00.583
importantly to share best

00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:02.685
practices and address ways that

00:57:02.752 --> 00:57:03.253
we can support the students

00:57:03.319 --> 00:57:04.721
moving forward very good follow

00:57:04.788 --> 00:57:06.656
questions Senate Archuleta. Yes

00:57:06.723 --> 00:57:07.223
I just wanted to follow up

00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:10.593
thank you for your enthusiasm.

00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:11.227
If this paper. Right here I'm

00:57:11.294 --> 00:57:12.962
looking at it Jeff would you

00:57:13.029 --> 00:57:16.599
like to graduate in four years.

00:57:16.666 --> 00:57:18.701
Eight you must give us. Fifteen

00:57:18.768 --> 00:57:20.570
units per year. Be you must

00:57:20.637 --> 00:57:22.572
maintain a C. average. Sign

00:57:22.639 --> 00:57:23.173
this contract we'll make it

00:57:23.239 --> 00:57:24.941
happen. Just that simple how

00:57:25.008 --> 00:57:27.010
many students you think would

00:57:27.076 --> 00:57:28.845
sign this from a freshman

00:57:28.912 --> 00:57:32.615
class. Just that simple. And I

00:57:32.682 --> 00:57:36.586
would imagine just about every

00:57:36.653 --> 00:57:37.220
fresh but today. I'll sign that

00:57:37.287 --> 00:57:40.890
for years. C. plus. Fifteen

00:57:40.957 --> 00:57:47.230
units. But we're not asking up.

00:57:47.297 --> 00:57:47.831
In and I think we're here to

00:57:47.897 --> 00:57:48.998
try to help. So if a freshman

00:57:49.065 --> 00:57:50.967
class came in. And out of two

00:57:51.034 --> 00:57:52.735
thousand and a freshman class a

00:57:52.802 --> 00:57:54.938
thousand said I. man. You only

00:57:55.004 --> 00:57:55.605
have two hundred. Then you need

00:57:55.672 --> 00:57:58.708
to ask us. For more faculty.

00:57:58.775 --> 00:58:01.044
For another building or two.

00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:02.912
You know what we're asking you

00:58:02.979 --> 00:58:06.816
to give us more graduates but

00:58:06.883 --> 00:58:08.718
we're also asking how. Can we-

00:58:08.785 --> 00:58:09.319
and I think this would be a

00:58:09.385 --> 00:58:12.689
start because- your answer

00:58:12.755 --> 00:58:14.891
provost and everyone should you

00:58:14.958 --> 00:58:15.525
want to be more aggressive you

00:58:15.592 --> 00:58:16.993
want better numbers. Give us

00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:18.761
this. And I'm open to that.

00:58:18.828 --> 00:58:22.765
Whatever that might be. And in

00:58:22.832 --> 00:58:24.701
thank you so much because I

00:58:24.767 --> 00:58:25.335
think that if we do put that

00:58:25.401 --> 00:58:28.705
form out there yes we are going

00:58:28.771 --> 00:58:29.305
to get a lot of responses but

00:58:29.372 --> 00:58:31.140
we also. What we recognize that

00:58:31.207 --> 00:58:33.176
our campus is that we want to

00:58:33.243 --> 00:58:34.911
build a holistic program and

00:58:34.978 --> 00:58:37.146
support to ensure that not only

00:58:37.213 --> 00:58:38.781
are they telling as yes but

00:58:38.848 --> 00:58:40.850
that we are building all the

00:58:40.917 --> 00:58:41.451
support that they need to be

00:58:41.517 --> 00:58:43.119
able to move forward and be

00:58:43.186 --> 00:58:44.954
successful not only here. On

00:58:45.021 --> 00:58:45.488
our campus and beyond our

00:58:45.555 --> 00:58:48.892
campus. And I think that the

00:58:48.958 --> 00:58:49.425
dilemma that the center

00:58:49.492 --> 00:58:51.094
argillite is raising is that.

00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:53.029
We're committed to helping but-

00:58:53.096 --> 00:58:54.898
more resources and you only

00:58:54.964 --> 00:58:56.733
have a hundred and twenty kids.

00:58:56.799 --> 00:58:58.868
In the program what is that.

00:58:58.935 --> 00:58:59.535
That is that the demand that we

00:58:59.602 --> 00:59:01.037
needed now. Deal with with you

00:59:01.104 --> 00:59:03.172
know hundreds of thousands of

00:59:03.239 --> 00:59:04.908
dollars more when. Somehow we

00:59:04.974 --> 00:59:06.843
have to marry those two. If you

00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:09.045
have a robust program. We want

00:59:09.112 --> 00:59:10.914
to make it successful but if we

00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:12.815
don't see a robust program it's

00:59:12.882 --> 00:59:14.717
hard to justify the more the

00:59:14.784 --> 00:59:15.285
money so somehow we have to.

00:59:15.351 --> 00:59:16.886
Work that that issue through.

00:59:16.953 --> 00:59:19.022
Alright with that I thank you

00:59:19.088 --> 00:59:19.589
very much doctor. For your

00:59:19.656 --> 00:59:21.190
great work here on the campus

00:59:21.257 --> 00:59:22.825
appreciate it very much. As I

00:59:22.892 --> 00:59:24.894
mentioned earlier we have a

00:59:24.961 --> 00:59:25.495
great representative from the

00:59:25.561 --> 00:59:28.731
academic Senate. A doctor

00:59:28.798 --> 00:59:30.934
Charles Thomas thank you Dr

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:31.567
Thomas your being here you're

00:59:31.634 --> 00:59:34.804
the chair. Your business law

00:59:34.871 --> 00:59:35.371
assistant professor. So I

00:59:35.438 --> 00:59:37.073
can't. You advise students

00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:38.841
interested in law school which

00:59:38.908 --> 00:59:40.743
is fantastic. But we thank you

00:59:40.810 --> 00:59:41.311
for your leadership of the

00:59:41.377 --> 00:59:45.081
faculty here. And we appreciate

00:59:45.148 --> 00:59:45.682
your insight you can bring to

00:59:45.748 --> 00:59:46.783
our discussion today thank you.

00:59:46.849 --> 00:59:49.118
Thank you senator Glazer the

00:59:49.185 --> 00:59:49.619
select committee on such

00:59:49.686 --> 00:59:51.087
success. As well as the staff

00:59:51.154 --> 00:59:52.789
and volunteers that make the

00:59:52.855 --> 00:59:54.958
state. Senate college to a

00:59:55.024 --> 00:59:57.093
reality. I want to thank you

00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.728
for giving me the opportunity

00:59:58.795 --> 01:00:00.797
to provide a few words. Our

01:00:00.863 --> 01:00:02.899
it's important for us to focus

01:00:02.966 --> 01:00:04.734
on the in a relationship

01:00:04.801 --> 01:00:06.970
between student success. Often

01:00:07.036 --> 01:00:08.938
measured by those graduation

01:00:09.005 --> 01:00:11.007
rates. Alongside the bear years

01:00:11.074 --> 01:00:13.042
such as hunger. Housing in

01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:15.278
security and adequate mental

01:00:15.345 --> 01:00:17.280
health counseling and services.

01:00:17.347 --> 01:00:20.917
Addict academic success. Not be

01:00:20.984 --> 01:00:22.752
pursued without acknowledging

01:00:22.819 --> 01:00:26.923
the foundation. Of having

01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:27.523
steady housing or enough food

01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:31.194
to eat. Not on the chair the

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:31.828
academic Senate here it act C.

01:00:31.894 --> 01:00:33.196
S. U. D. H. where are but

01:00:33.262 --> 01:00:36.866
business law. For the past.

01:00:36.933 --> 01:00:38.968
Moreover I live within walking

01:00:39.035 --> 01:00:40.837
distance to the campus

01:00:40.903 --> 01:00:42.905
representing an investment in

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:45.008
the long term viability of this

01:00:45.074 --> 01:00:45.575
campus and the community it

01:00:45.641 --> 01:00:49.245
serves. In many ways I reflect

01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:53.082
our student body. Like 63% of

01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:54.984
our incoming class I'm the

01:00:55.051 --> 01:00:57.020
first in my family to attend

01:00:57.086 --> 01:00:59.055
college like 82% of our

01:00:59.122 --> 01:01:01.157
incoming class I'm a member of

01:01:01.224 --> 01:01:03.026
an under represented minority

01:01:03.092 --> 01:01:05.061
group. M. like 70% of our

01:01:05.128 --> 01:01:07.063
incoming class I was Appel

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:10.900
recipient throughout college.

01:01:10.967 --> 01:01:12.869
Yet despite the similarities

01:01:12.935 --> 01:01:14.904
our student body faces a

01:01:14.971 --> 01:01:17.040
significantly more expensive

01:01:17.106 --> 01:01:19.075
collegiate landscape then when

01:01:19.142 --> 01:01:21.277
I attended college. The

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:24.881
Sacramento bee reported on may

01:01:24.947 --> 01:01:26.916
first of this year that it

01:01:26.983 --> 01:01:29.152
costs close to fourteen times

01:01:29.218 --> 01:01:31.120
what it cost forty years ago

01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:33.122
back when you senator Glazer

01:01:33.189 --> 01:01:34.891
graduated from San Diego state.

01:01:34.957 --> 01:01:37.160
And that is adjusted for

01:01:37.226 --> 01:01:41.197
inflation. Fourteen times the

01:01:41.264 --> 01:01:45.034
cost fifth. Costs this I'm

01:01:45.101 --> 01:01:46.936
sorry I raise my voice our

01:01:47.003 --> 01:01:50.873
students have been taking a

01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:51.407
longer pathway to college

01:01:51.474 --> 01:01:53.309
degree. Check your early at the

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:56.879
junior and senior levels

01:01:56.946 --> 01:02:00.883
roughly 28% of our juniors in

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:01.384
fall of twenty eighteen

01:02:01.451 --> 01:02:04.887
attended part time. In over 30%

01:02:04.954 --> 01:02:07.190
of our seniors this represents

01:02:07.256 --> 01:02:09.258
double the CSU system wide

01:02:09.325 --> 01:02:12.895
average for juniors for fall of

01:02:12.962 --> 01:02:15.198
twenty eighteen. In contrast to

01:02:15.264 --> 01:02:17.400
our students I went to college

01:02:17.467 --> 01:02:20.937
full time taking out loans not

01:02:21.003 --> 01:02:23.106
only for tuition but also for

01:02:23.172 --> 01:02:25.041
living expenses on campus. I

01:02:25.108 --> 01:02:27.343
find our students are far more

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:29.178
conservative in their student

01:02:29.245 --> 01:02:31.214
loan choices not taking out the

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.116
amount of loans that I felt

01:02:33.182 --> 01:02:35.051
comfortable taking out now I

01:02:35.118 --> 01:02:39.055
still have educational debt. So

01:02:39.122 --> 01:02:39.655
I really can't fault them for

01:02:39.722 --> 01:02:43.092
boarding student loans. However.

01:02:43.159 --> 01:02:45.194
This leads our students to

01:02:45.261 --> 01:02:46.896
enter into the work force

01:02:46.963 --> 01:02:47.497
adding additional demands upon

01:02:47.563 --> 01:02:53.002
their time. Similarly commuting

01:02:53.069 --> 01:02:55.004
the campus keeps our students

01:02:55.071 --> 01:02:57.006
within their existing familial

01:02:57.073 --> 01:02:59.208
relationships placing yet

01:02:59.275 --> 01:03:03.079
another demand think child care

01:03:03.146 --> 01:03:05.114
elder care on their time. Some

01:03:05.181 --> 01:03:07.383
of the research literature

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:09.318
implies that those with thirty

01:03:09.385 --> 01:03:11.187
plus hours of outside

01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:13.222
commitment largely work

01:03:13.289 --> 01:03:15.291
including caretaking can't

01:03:15.358 --> 01:03:17.393
thrive and be successful with

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:21.063
the fifteen unit load per

01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:23.266
semester. Now our main unit

01:03:23.332 --> 01:03:25.001
load has been improving

01:03:25.067 --> 01:03:27.103
currently at twelve point four

01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:29.172
for the campus and thirteen

01:03:29.238 --> 01:03:31.240
units for incoming freshmen but

01:03:31.307 --> 01:03:35.011
we're still not at fifteen. In

01:03:35.077 --> 01:03:37.013
this is the context that frames

01:03:37.079 --> 01:03:39.182
are four year and six year

01:03:39.248 --> 01:03:43.019
graduation numbers. S. faculty

01:03:43.085 --> 01:03:43.619
we are proud of the work that

01:03:43.686 --> 01:03:45.221
we do with students and C. S.

01:03:45.288 --> 01:03:49.158
U. D. H.'s ranked fourth in the

01:03:49.225 --> 01:03:51.394
state for social mobility where

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:55.031
students have secured earnings

01:03:55.097 --> 01:03:56.999
that are two quart house above.

01:03:57.066 --> 01:03:59.068
Their parents earning rates C.

01:03:59.135 --> 01:04:01.170
S. UT age is where

01:04:01.237 --> 01:04:03.272
transformable social mobility

01:04:03.339 --> 01:04:07.443
happens. Faculty is C. S. UT H.

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:09.212
forge pathways to meet the

01:04:09.278 --> 01:04:11.214
needs of students for example

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.216
sociology professor Katie Pinto

01:04:13.282 --> 01:04:15.151
was recognized by the

01:04:15.218 --> 01:04:17.153
chancellor's office for her

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:19.021
innovations and graduated

01:04:19.088 --> 01:04:21.257
pricing. In addition the

01:04:21.324 --> 01:04:23.159
university advising center

01:04:23.226 --> 01:04:25.027
works closely with faculty

01:04:25.094 --> 01:04:27.230
advisors and mentors for me to

01:04:27.296 --> 01:04:29.165
college with several faculty

01:04:29.232 --> 01:04:31.300
participating in a fellow it

01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:33.202
buys in program. Why we

01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:35.304
continue to make strides

01:04:35.371 --> 01:04:39.041
towards our graduate initiative

01:04:39.108 --> 01:04:39.675
twenty twenty five goals we are

01:04:39.742 --> 01:04:43.045
also attempting to address our

01:04:43.112 --> 01:04:45.147
long term student needs with

01:04:45.214 --> 01:04:49.018
building new dorms on campus.

01:04:49.085 --> 01:04:51.120
Transitioning this campus from

01:04:51.187 --> 01:04:53.189
principally commuter to

01:04:53.256 --> 01:04:55.124
principally residential will

01:04:55.191 --> 01:04:57.393
provide students the option to

01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:59.462
join a living learning

01:04:59.528 --> 01:05:01.330
community on a campus to

01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:05.268
minimize those outside

01:05:05.334 --> 01:05:05.735
commitments and I just

01:05:05.801 --> 01:05:07.169
previously discussed. We're

01:05:07.236 --> 01:05:09.338
also making efforts to measure

01:05:09.405 --> 01:05:11.440
the level of our basic needs on

01:05:11.507 --> 01:05:15.211
the Dominguez hills campus. Our

01:05:15.278 --> 01:05:17.146
campus wide survey goes live in

01:05:17.213 --> 01:05:19.282
two weeks this will help us to

01:05:19.348 --> 01:05:21.350
accurately identify the extent

01:05:21.417 --> 01:05:25.154
basic needs are unmet on this

01:05:25.221 --> 01:05:27.056
campus we will hopefully inform

01:05:27.123 --> 01:05:29.358
campus policy and funding

01:05:29.425 --> 01:05:31.427
moving forward. In the mean

01:05:31.494 --> 01:05:37.133
time. The campus is engaging in

01:05:37.199 --> 01:05:37.700
out reach for its cal fresh

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:41.237
program we are a leader in

01:05:41.304 --> 01:05:43.239
affordable learning solutions

01:05:43.306 --> 01:05:45.408
for textbooks we are utilizing

01:05:45.474 --> 01:05:47.276
a food recovery network for

01:05:47.343 --> 01:05:49.345
campus dining and for our

01:05:49.412 --> 01:05:51.514
campus farm we have developed a

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:55.151
weekly farmer's market that

01:05:55.217 --> 01:05:55.651
brings fresh fruits and

01:05:55.718 --> 01:05:57.386
vegetables to the campus

01:05:57.453 --> 01:05:59.355
community we've developed a

01:05:59.422 --> 01:06:01.324
basic needs act which the

01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:03.392
provost has told you a little

01:06:03.459 --> 01:06:05.361
bit about. Our and we have

01:06:05.428 --> 01:06:07.163
established funds for emergency

01:06:07.229 --> 01:06:07.730
housing and pay it forward

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:13.269
grants. But we also know that

01:06:13.336 --> 01:06:15.471
the current need outpaces the

01:06:15.538 --> 01:06:19.175
supply. At the start of the

01:06:19.241 --> 01:06:21.310
semester as academic Senate

01:06:21.377 --> 01:06:23.279
chair I. room recommended that

01:06:23.346 --> 01:06:25.281
all faculty include in there

01:06:25.348 --> 01:06:27.350
still apply resources for food

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:31.187
and housing and secure students

01:06:31.253 --> 01:06:31.754
as well as announcing the

01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:35.157
upcoming basically survey

01:06:35.224 --> 01:06:35.691
student affairs is also

01:06:35.758 --> 01:06:39.161
provided the guide of resources

01:06:39.228 --> 01:06:39.695
for faculty and staff. To

01:06:39.762 --> 01:06:43.432
direct students. S. faculty we

01:06:43.499 --> 01:06:47.303
often serve as Sir get support

01:06:47.370 --> 01:06:47.803
for students that their

01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:51.407
families cannot. Because they

01:06:51.474 --> 01:06:52.007
simply have not navigated the

01:06:52.074 --> 01:06:53.576
system. This support includes

01:06:53.642 --> 01:06:55.478
teaching time management

01:06:55.544 --> 01:06:59.181
establishing strong personal

01:06:59.248 --> 01:06:59.815
and professional identity and

01:06:59.882 --> 01:07:01.617
develop a sense of belonging in

01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:05.287
the academic community. In this

01:07:05.354 --> 01:07:05.755
sense the faculty are

01:07:05.821 --> 01:07:07.523
influential in the development

01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:11.193
of our students and remain

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:13.195
committed to their life long

01:07:13.262 --> 01:07:15.531
learning. As we say once a Toro

01:07:15.598 --> 01:07:19.201
always a Torah. And again thank

01:07:19.268 --> 01:07:19.869
you for giving me the option to

01:07:19.935 --> 01:07:21.370
speak to the select committee

01:07:21.437 --> 01:07:23.372
on student success thank you

01:07:23.439 --> 01:07:25.274
thank you doctor Thomas and I'm

01:07:25.341 --> 01:07:25.708

you and your faculty members of

01:07:29.345 --> 01:07:31.180
done on I guess you call

01:07:31.247 --> 01:07:31.781
universal learning this were

01:07:31.847 --> 01:07:33.516
books don't cost as much as at

01:07:33.582 --> 01:07:35.384
the fundamentally what it's

01:07:35.451 --> 01:07:37.186
about yes. That they can access

01:07:37.253 --> 01:07:39.355
the- the study materials

01:07:39.422 --> 01:07:41.190
without this enormous costs

01:07:41.257 --> 01:07:41.791
that's a fantastic thing that

01:07:41.857 --> 01:07:43.259
you and your colleagues are

01:07:43.325 --> 01:07:45.261
doing it's a big deal those are

01:07:45.327 --> 01:07:45.828
huge costs for many students

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:47.663
and- I appreciate the work of

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:49.565
your faculty to try to make

01:07:49.632 --> 01:07:51.567
that better for kids and I also

01:07:51.634 --> 01:07:53.669
want to. Applaud you and your

01:07:53.736 --> 01:07:55.538
colleagues for the syllabus

01:07:55.604 --> 01:07:57.473
idea and identified in in in

01:07:57.540 --> 01:07:59.341
many spaces not just a on a

01:07:59.408 --> 01:08:01.644
website we're out those who

01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:03.446
have basic needs needs can get

01:08:03.512 --> 01:08:05.514
some help so thank you but let

01:08:05.581 --> 01:08:07.349
me say I know we have some time

01:08:07.416 --> 01:08:09.385
issues here but let me give you

01:08:09.452 --> 01:08:10.019
one question. If there were you

01:08:10.085 --> 01:08:11.654
have a magic wand now

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:15.458
graduations get two wishes to

01:08:15.524 --> 01:08:17.293
improve the four year

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:21.597
graduation. Rate here at to

01:08:21.664 --> 01:08:22.231
make this sells well with those

01:08:22.298 --> 01:08:25.501
two wishes be. Additional

01:08:25.568 --> 01:08:27.303
resources specifically. Toward

01:08:27.369 --> 01:08:27.837
making this a residential

01:08:27.903 --> 01:08:29.638
campus okay. And in terms of

01:08:29.705 --> 01:08:31.507
supplemental instruction

01:08:31.574 --> 01:08:33.642
equivalent to what we see in

01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:35.578
the first year experience for

01:08:35.644 --> 01:08:37.613
the second third and fourth

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.582
year grace okay those in those

01:08:39.648 --> 01:08:41.450
enhancements to create better

01:08:41.517 --> 01:08:43.385
connection and engagement and

01:08:43.452 --> 01:08:45.321
support absolutely wonderful

01:08:45.387 --> 01:08:45.888
ideas and I'm glad you're

01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:47.523
excited about the dorm and I

01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:49.325
think that all the folks who

01:08:49.391 --> 01:08:51.327
are smarter than me recognize

01:08:51.393 --> 01:08:53.329
the advantage of a residential

01:08:53.395 --> 01:08:53.996
community and how that can take

01:08:54.063 --> 01:08:55.698
care of distractions as you

01:08:55.764 --> 01:08:57.633
described. And keep greater

01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:59.401
cohesion and add. And

01:08:59.468 --> 01:09:00.002
continuing education which was

01:09:00.069 --> 01:09:01.704
what we're all striving for so

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:03.639
thank you any any other

01:09:03.706 --> 01:09:04.273
questions yes the only member

01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:05.741
thank you thank you professor

01:09:05.808 --> 01:09:11.547
Thomas you know I. I your your

01:09:11.614 --> 01:09:12.147
your comments reminded me when

01:09:12.214 --> 01:09:13.582
I was on the. The assembly

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:15.584
budget committee when. Governor

01:09:15.651 --> 01:09:17.419
brown then governor brown first

01:09:17.486 --> 01:09:19.522
pushed the four year graduation

01:09:19.588 --> 01:09:21.557
initiative. You know we all

01:09:21.624 --> 01:09:23.526
understood that that if his is

01:09:23.592 --> 01:09:25.728
intent was to. Try to open up

01:09:25.794 --> 01:09:27.463
more opportunities by by

01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:29.398
getting more students in and

01:09:29.465 --> 01:09:31.400
out of our universities and

01:09:31.467 --> 01:09:33.335
there by. You know a graduating

01:09:33.402 --> 01:09:35.638
more students but- there there

01:09:35.704 --> 01:09:37.606
was one comment that. That the

01:09:37.673 --> 01:09:39.575
governor brown made that I

01:09:39.642 --> 01:09:41.677
thought was perhaps reflective

01:09:41.744 --> 01:09:45.347
of. The different perspectives

01:09:45.414 --> 01:09:45.848
and the different life

01:09:45.915 --> 01:09:49.351
experiences that. That we need

01:09:49.418 --> 01:09:51.520
to make sure we are listening

01:09:51.587 --> 01:09:53.556
to people like you and your

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:54.156
students. You know when you

01:09:54.223 --> 01:09:55.558
talked about how. So many of

01:09:55.624 --> 01:09:57.560
your students are so busy

01:09:57.626 --> 01:09:59.695
working. You know to be able to

01:09:59.762 --> 01:10:01.330
put themselves through school.

01:10:01.397 --> 01:10:03.332
They don't have time to be at

01:10:03.399 --> 01:10:05.334
attending a lot of. Programs

01:10:05.401 --> 01:10:07.903
and it reminded me. Governor

01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:09.505
brown talked about all. And

01:10:09.572 --> 01:10:11.774
back in his day. You know he

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:13.642
took the meandering that road

01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:17.580
through life and you explored

01:10:17.646 --> 01:10:21.784
in now. In many different ways

01:10:21.850 --> 01:10:22.351
but- yeah in the end and it

01:10:22.418 --> 01:10:23.652
immediate met the criticism

01:10:23.719 --> 01:10:25.354
from many students that were at

01:10:25.421 --> 01:10:26.021
that hearing. Saying that we're

01:10:26.088 --> 01:10:27.756
not meandering were just too

01:10:27.823 --> 01:10:29.792
busy working to put try to put

01:10:29.858 --> 01:10:31.560
ourselves school and so. You

01:10:31.627 --> 01:10:35.798
know. I mean I. I am listening

01:10:35.864 --> 01:10:37.633
to this the station of course

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:45.474
you know we always. You know.

01:10:45.541 --> 01:10:46.075
For hueso government market in

01:10:46.141 --> 01:10:57.586
and. Faces some of that day the

01:10:57.653 --> 01:10:59.521
most challenging economic

01:10:59.588 --> 01:11:01.457
circumstances with with your

01:11:01.523 --> 01:11:02.091
students and so I. I want to

01:11:02.157 --> 01:11:03.759
make sure that that that that.

01:11:03.826 --> 01:11:05.794
You know that the policy makers

01:11:05.861 --> 01:11:07.763
are in touch with the reality

01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:09.465
and I think that's why we're

01:11:09.531 --> 01:11:10.065
all here and I want thank you

01:11:10.132 --> 01:11:11.667
very much for comes. This state

01:11:11.734 --> 01:11:13.469
is the only member I would just

01:11:13.535 --> 01:11:13.969
say just in terms of a

01:11:14.036 --> 01:11:15.838
statistic that you could point

01:11:15.904 --> 01:11:17.806
to. Would be the average age of

01:11:17.873 --> 01:11:21.477
our juniors and seniors compare

01:11:21.543 --> 01:11:23.612
to the CSU system. Are the

01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:25.481
average age of our juniors

01:11:25.547 --> 01:11:27.616
based upon fall of twenty

01:11:27.683 --> 01:11:29.785
eighteen was twenty five point

01:11:29.852 --> 01:11:31.587
three sorry for the point three

01:11:31.654 --> 01:11:33.522
of years but- it is. What it

01:11:33.589 --> 01:11:35.557
is. Within the system it is

01:11:35.624 --> 01:11:37.626
twenty two point nine. So that

01:11:37.693 --> 01:11:38.227
difference of two point four

01:11:38.293 --> 01:11:41.463
years what difference does that

01:11:41.530 --> 01:11:43.532
make well it's called life. And

01:11:43.599 --> 01:11:47.469
all the set if you become

01:11:47.536 --> 01:11:51.473
betrothed you now have a child

01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:53.742
you now have a- fireman to were

01:11:53.809 --> 01:11:57.479
you have. The dish familiar

01:11:57.546 --> 01:11:59.515
quiet it's the types of. I

01:11:59.581 --> 01:12:01.483
feel. That I needed some time.

01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:03.485
Will inhibit our ability

01:12:03.552 --> 01:12:04.086
despite our best intentions to

right in the Mike. Can you hear

01:13:35.911 --> 01:13:37.746
me now yeah there we go. It was

01:13:37.813 --> 01:13:39.615
not that long ago that our

01:13:39.681 --> 01:13:41.617
society frequently jokes about

01:13:41.683 --> 01:13:42.217
college students surviving on

01:13:42.284 --> 01:13:43.886
top Rahman and couch surfing.

01:13:43.952 --> 01:13:46.021
Many of us knew that college

01:13:46.088 --> 01:13:47.689
students experience food and

01:13:47.756 --> 01:13:49.625
housing and securities however

01:13:49.691 --> 01:13:50.092
we did not realize how

01:13:50.159 --> 01:13:52.027
prevalent it was and we did not

01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:54.062
feel quipped or empowered. To

01:13:54.129 --> 01:13:57.599
address these challenges. Today

01:13:57.666 --> 01:13:58.233
the climate around basic needs

01:13:58.300 --> 01:14:00.002
is changing and we truly

01:14:00.068 --> 01:14:01.670
appreciate your efforts to

01:14:01.737 --> 01:14:03.605
happen tension dialogue.

01:14:03.672 --> 01:14:04.273
Regarding what our students are

01:14:04.339 --> 01:14:05.808
experiencing and how our

01:14:05.874 --> 01:14:07.776
campuses can offer holistic

01:14:07.843 --> 01:14:09.611
services to support student

01:14:09.678 --> 01:14:11.814
success. I'm sure you all are

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:13.615
familiar with the cal state

01:14:13.682 --> 01:14:14.149
chancellor's office basing

01:14:14.216 --> 01:14:17.619
these initiatives study. Data

01:14:17.686 --> 01:14:18.153
stating that 41% of our

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:19.721
students are experiencing food

01:14:19.788 --> 01:14:21.957
insecurity and ten point nine

01:14:22.024 --> 01:14:22.391
of our students are

01:14:22.457 --> 01:14:23.859
experiencing homelessness

01:14:23.926 --> 01:14:26.061
within the once or twice within

01:14:26.128 --> 01:14:27.729
the first twelve months. The

01:14:27.796 --> 01:14:29.631
study revealed that students

01:14:29.698 --> 01:14:30.232
who identify as black African

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:33.635
American and first Jim students

01:14:33.702 --> 01:14:34.236
are more likely to experience

01:14:34.303 --> 01:14:35.771
housing and securities. Amongst

01:14:35.838 --> 01:14:38.006
their peers additionally former

01:14:38.073 --> 01:14:39.708
foster you've students are

01:14:39.775 --> 01:14:41.977
doubles that number by 24% by

01:14:42.044 --> 01:14:43.846
experiencing housing and

01:14:43.912 --> 01:14:46.014
securities. This data from the

01:14:46.081 --> 01:14:47.816
chancellor's office basing the

01:14:47.883 --> 01:14:49.618
study has been extremely

01:14:49.685 --> 01:14:50.152
helpful and advancing our

01:14:50.219 --> 01:14:52.020
understanding of what our

01:14:52.087 --> 01:14:54.022
students need moreover it has

01:14:54.089 --> 01:14:55.924
elevated conversations around

01:14:55.991 --> 01:14:57.626
what colleges and universities

01:14:57.693 --> 01:14:59.795
can do better to support.

01:14:59.862 --> 01:15:00.362
Students and in need of food

01:15:00.429 --> 01:15:03.765
and housing. Deep the

01:15:03.832 --> 01:15:04.333
demographics of our student

01:15:04.399 --> 01:15:06.001
body and the preliminary

01:15:06.068 --> 01:15:07.903
information we gather from our

01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:09.872
via the our basic needs program

01:15:09.938 --> 01:15:10.505
we believe that the number of

01:15:10.572 --> 01:15:12.074
students experiencing basic

01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:13.976
needs challenges I. cal state

01:15:14.042 --> 01:15:14.610
Dominguez hills. Is larger than

01:15:14.676 --> 01:15:17.846
what the study indicated. The

01:15:17.913 --> 01:15:18.480
number of students who have a

01:15:18.547 --> 01:15:20.215
role to add D. H. has increased

01:15:20.282 --> 01:15:22.050
by 33% by the year two

01:15:22.117 --> 01:15:23.919
thousand. This music terms of

01:15:23.986 --> 01:15:25.921
people that the number who were

01:15:25.988 --> 01:15:27.823
likely to experience basic

01:15:27.890 --> 01:15:29.758
needs major by the hello triple

01:15:29.825 --> 01:15:31.927
proxy. Has grown by three

01:15:31.994 --> 01:15:32.494
thousand five hundred ninety

01:15:32.561 --> 01:15:35.797
seven students in the year two

01:15:35.864 --> 01:15:36.365
thousand to six thousand and

01:15:36.431 --> 01:15:36.965
ninety four and the year two

01:15:37.032 --> 01:15:39.835
thousand ten. And eight

01:15:39.902 --> 01:15:40.369
thousand eight hundred and

01:15:40.435 --> 01:15:41.870
thirty three in the year twenty

01:15:41.937 --> 01:15:42.504
nineteen this year. This is a

01:15:42.571 --> 01:15:44.106
significant number of students

01:15:44.172 --> 01:15:45.908
for whom our campus aims to

01:15:45.974 --> 01:15:47.910
provide outreach education

01:15:47.976 --> 01:15:50.078
services and follow up. Layered

01:15:50.145 --> 01:15:52.047
onto this the campus has a

01:15:52.114 --> 01:15:53.916
significant number of first

01:15:53.982 --> 01:15:55.984
generation students this is an

01:15:56.051 --> 01:15:57.753
indicator that the student is

01:15:57.819 --> 01:15:58.287
not likely to know that

01:15:58.353 --> 01:16:00.122
resources are available or

01:16:00.188 --> 01:16:01.990
where to find them. This number

01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:03.825
has also increase from two

01:16:03.892 --> 01:16:04.393
thousand nine hundred fifty

01:16:04.459 --> 01:16:07.996
five in the year two thousand

01:16:08.063 --> 01:16:08.630
to six thousand and ninety five

01:16:08.697 --> 01:16:10.132
in the year twenty ten and then

01:16:10.198 --> 01:16:12.100
currently eight thousand one

01:16:12.167 --> 01:16:12.668
hundred and seventy two this

01:16:12.734 --> 01:16:15.771
year. Like many other

01:16:15.837 --> 01:16:16.405
institutions in the CSU system.

01:16:16.471 --> 01:16:18.006
Our campus has been working

01:16:18.073 --> 01:16:19.775
diligently to develop a

01:16:19.841 --> 01:16:20.309
comprehensive basic needs

01:16:20.375 --> 01:16:22.077
program. In addition to a

01:16:22.144 --> 01:16:24.112
current budget request this

01:16:24.179 --> 01:16:25.914
will allow us to hire our first

01:16:25.981 --> 01:16:27.883
case worker on campus. We are

01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:29.885
addressing basing these issues

01:16:29.952 --> 01:16:30.385
are Dominguez hills by

01:16:30.452 --> 01:16:31.954
maintaining food pantries

01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:33.889
providing emergency funds mercy

01:16:33.956 --> 01:16:35.958
housing and collecting data to

01:16:36.024 --> 01:16:36.558
better understand basic needs

01:16:36.625 --> 01:16:39.895
challenges on campus. Our

01:16:39.962 --> 01:16:40.529
campus currently has three food

01:16:40.595 --> 01:16:42.097
pantries one of our food

01:16:42.164 --> 01:16:43.799
pantries provides perishable

01:16:43.865 --> 01:16:45.834
items as well as as well as non

pantries receive fresh produce

01:16:48.437 --> 01:16:50.205
from my campus urban farm and

01:16:50.272 --> 01:16:53.775
local nonprofit organizations.

01:16:53.842 --> 01:16:55.777
Over the past academic year we

01:16:55.844 --> 01:16:56.345
had thirteen hundred unique

01:16:56.411 --> 01:16:58.246

01:16:58.313 --> 01:17:00.015
food pantries thirty three

01:17:00.082 --> 01:17:02.050
hundred times. We have a cow

01:17:02.117 --> 01:17:02.584
fresh food program that

01:17:02.651 --> 01:17:04.052
provides students were

01:17:04.119 --> 01:17:05.921
application assistance CalPERS

01:17:05.988 --> 01:17:07.956
has served over a hundred

01:17:08.023 --> 01:17:08.590
eighty eight students this past

01:17:08.657 --> 01:17:10.192
academic year. Our students are

01:17:10.258 --> 01:17:12.127
able to use their benefits at

01:17:12.194 --> 01:17:13.996
our local farmers market and

01:17:14.062 --> 01:17:15.864
they're able to utilize the

01:17:15.931 --> 01:17:16.465
market match. The market match

01:17:16.531 --> 01:17:18.000
program there. For those

01:17:18.066 --> 01:17:20.068
students who experience

01:17:20.135 --> 01:17:21.803
hardships and do not have

01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:22.304
access to any financial

01:17:22.371 --> 01:17:23.939
assistance. DH has

01:17:24.006 --> 01:17:26.008
institutionalized the faculty

01:17:26.074 --> 01:17:27.909
and staff student support grant

01:17:27.976 --> 01:17:30.078
in the spring of twenty fifteen

01:17:30.145 --> 01:17:30.679
and our students are able to

01:17:30.746 --> 01:17:33.815
apply up to a thousand dollars.

01:17:33.882 --> 01:17:34.449
Not surprisingly homelessness

01:17:34.516 --> 01:17:36.118
fiercely impacts of students

01:17:36.184 --> 01:17:39.788
ability to remain in school and

01:17:39.855 --> 01:17:40.389
be successful students were

sleeping in their cars faces

01:17:42.157 --> 01:17:44.059
serious several issues

01:17:44.126 --> 01:17:44.659
including safety nutrition and

01:17:44.726 --> 01:17:48.063
hygiene. When students

01:17:48.130 --> 01:17:49.898
experience homelessness chances

01:17:49.965 --> 01:17:50.499
are all areas of their basic

01:17:50.565 --> 01:17:52.200
needs are being compromised

01:17:52.267 --> 01:17:54.302
which in turn will impact our

01:17:54.369 --> 01:17:55.904
students academic in mental

01:17:55.971 --> 01:17:57.906

occupied by hunger in class

01:18:06.148 --> 01:18:08.016
thinking of ways they can find

01:18:08.083 --> 01:18:09.918
their next meal and leaving

01:18:09.985 --> 01:18:10.485
class to get unhealthy items

01:18:10.552 --> 01:18:13.922
from vending machines. In order

to support our students last

01:18:14.589 --> 01:18:16.224

01:18:16.291 --> 01:18:16.758
housing for students who

01:18:16.825 --> 01:18:18.193
experience housing and

01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:20.228
securities we have two one

01:18:20.295 --> 01:18:22.264
bedroom units at our university

01:18:22.330 --> 01:18:24.332

01:18:24.399 --> 01:18:24.933
to stay there for up to ten

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.201
days. We are able to

01:18:26.268 --> 01:18:28.236
accommodate those students who

01:18:28.303 --> 01:18:30.305
may have children to ensure

01:18:30.372 --> 01:18:30.806
that we are serving our

01:18:30.872 --> 01:18:32.107
students equally. Those ten

01:18:32.174 --> 01:18:34.142
days we work with our students

01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:36.044
to connect with them connect

01:18:36.111 --> 01:18:36.645
them with our local nonprofit

01:18:36.711 --> 01:18:38.246
organization called path which

01:18:38.313 --> 01:18:40.148
is people system the homeless.

01:18:40.215 --> 01:18:42.084
To identify temporary and rapid

01:18:42.150 --> 01:18:44.252
re housing. These students are

01:18:44.319 --> 01:18:45.987
follow throughout the year and

01:18:46.054 --> 01:18:46.521
or connected to on and off

01:18:46.588 --> 01:18:49.925
campus resources. On October

01:18:49.991 --> 01:18:51.960
twenty third we are launching a

01:18:52.027 --> 01:18:52.461
campus wide basic needs

01:18:52.527 --> 01:18:54.229
assessment to a certain the

01:18:54.296 --> 01:18:55.931
accurate numbers of students.

01:18:55.997 --> 01:18:56.565
Who are experiencing food and

01:18:56.631 --> 01:18:59.935
housing and security as well as

01:19:00.001 --> 01:19:00.502
mental health and financial

01:19:00.569 --> 01:19:02.337
hardships we hope to have those

01:19:02.404 --> 01:19:04.206
results available in the spring

01:19:04.272 --> 01:19:05.941
semester and then streamline

01:19:06.007 --> 01:19:06.441
our programs to be as

01:19:06.508 --> 01:19:08.210

01:19:08.276 --> 01:19:14.082
students needs. If. Hello

01:19:16.084 --> 01:19:16.618
reiterate that none of this

01:19:16.685 --> 01:19:18.286
would be possible without the

01:19:18.353 --> 01:19:19.921
great support we have received

01:19:19.988 --> 01:19:21.923
from our local community.

01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:22.457
Campus leadership and our

01:19:22.524 --> 01:19:24.059

01:19:25.994 --> 01:19:26.595
confident that we will continue

01:19:26.661 --> 01:19:28.130
to make strides and how we

01:19:28.196 --> 01:19:29.931
support students who experience

01:19:29.998 --> 01:19:32.033
basic needs challenges. Thank

01:19:38.807 --> 01:19:40.208
with us our our- more than

01:19:40.275 --> 01:19:42.210
disappointing their shocking

01:19:42.277 --> 01:19:44.112
and depressing. Thirteen

01:19:44.179 --> 01:19:45.947
hundred unique users at your

01:19:46.014 --> 01:19:48.150
food bank. The I'm glad that

01:19:48.216 --> 01:19:48.683
the work you're doing on

01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:50.252
emergency shelter for those

01:19:50.318 --> 01:19:52.420
that. Have no other alternative

01:19:52.487 --> 01:19:54.356
I'm I'm glad to hear that

01:19:54.422 --> 01:19:55.957
you're collecting data this

01:19:56.024 --> 01:19:56.591
October twenty third survey is

01:19:56.658 --> 01:19:58.393
great. I think we all know how

01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:00.295
important that facts are for

01:20:00.362 --> 01:20:02.063
making good choices. Going

01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:04.232
forward. And if you had two

01:20:04.299 --> 01:20:06.268
wishes. That you could be

01:20:06.334 --> 01:20:08.203
granted I can imagine why yes

01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:10.205
you got one what it what would

01:20:10.272 --> 01:20:13.942
they be. I wanna is ongoing

01:20:14.009 --> 01:20:16.211
funding for programs so we can

01:20:16.278 --> 01:20:18.113
provide sustainable resources

01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:20.215
for students. And to assist. To

01:20:20.282 --> 01:20:23.952
continue on de stigmatizing

01:20:24.019 --> 01:20:24.586
housing and food and security

01:20:24.653 --> 01:20:26.454
on campus. And which we are

01:20:26.521 --> 01:20:28.390
doing as a program to inform

01:20:28.456 --> 01:20:30.425
and educate others on campus

01:20:30.492 --> 01:20:32.294
but we want to break down that

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:32.928
barrier so students don't feel

01:20:32.994 --> 01:20:34.396
embarrassed to come to our

01:20:34.462 --> 01:20:36.431
program to read. Receive the

01:20:36.498 --> 01:20:38.400
services that they need for

01:20:38.466 --> 01:20:38.967
them to be successful. Yeah

01:20:39.034 --> 01:20:42.237
well. Double wishes yeah and-

01:20:42.304 --> 01:20:44.239
the application that was cast

01:20:44.306 --> 01:20:46.408
that. For food and security to

01:20:46.474 --> 01:20:48.510
try to deal with that stigma

01:20:48.577 --> 01:20:50.245
issue and the acts that. It

01:20:50.312 --> 01:20:52.247
things. Certainly is a step

01:20:52.314 --> 01:20:56.284
forward there and- I'm when you

01:20:56.351 --> 01:21:00.088
talk about I'm going Monning.

01:21:00.155 --> 01:21:02.357
What what part do you have with

01:21:02.424 --> 01:21:02.924
the county. I mean are they

01:21:02.991 --> 01:21:04.059
partners in what you're doing I

01:21:04.125 --> 01:21:06.361
resources that we give to

01:21:06.428 --> 01:21:06.962
counties that they receive are

01:21:07.028 --> 01:21:08.129
they are they coming here to

01:21:08.196 --> 01:21:08.730
the campus to feel like your

01:21:08.797 --> 01:21:09.331
connection is. On the funding

01:21:09.397 --> 01:21:09.831
side with the county is

01:21:09.898 --> 01:21:12.467
together are Dennis students is

01:21:12.534 --> 01:21:13.068
currently in the room so he'll

01:21:13.134 --> 01:21:20.108
be able to answer that. Our our.

01:21:20.175 --> 01:21:20.742
That your choice at your option

01:21:20.809 --> 01:21:26.114
Jean it's nice to have you here.

01:21:26.181 --> 01:21:28.450
He's right is that the above my

01:21:28.516 --> 01:21:32.120
pay grade question kind of yes.

01:21:32.187 --> 01:21:32.721
They need to do that I'm sorry

01:21:32.787 --> 01:21:38.093
no you're fine. Just talk loud

01:21:38.159 --> 01:21:40.228
into it okay so right now are

01:21:40.295 --> 01:21:42.330
really the basic needs program

01:21:42.397 --> 01:21:44.099
is still really in its infancy

01:21:44.165 --> 01:21:46.167
and we don't. Necessarily have

01:21:46.234 --> 01:21:46.801
a strong partnership with the

01:21:46.868 --> 01:21:48.503
county in terms of access to

01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:52.140
funding what we have done up to

01:21:52.207 --> 01:21:52.641
this point is look at

01:21:52.707 --> 01:21:54.342
partnerships to immediately

01:21:54.409 --> 01:21:56.478
solve some more of the more

01:21:56.544 --> 01:21:58.079
immediate needs of students

01:21:58.146 --> 01:22:00.081
around housing and food. And so

01:22:00.148 --> 01:22:02.317
do our basic needs initiative a

01:22:02.384 --> 01:22:04.286
committee on campus we've been

01:22:04.352 --> 01:22:06.221
in conversations about how we

01:22:06.288 --> 01:22:08.290
can better leverage what we're

01:22:08.356 --> 01:22:12.093
doing here with our local part

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:14.262
partners including our city and

01:22:14.329 --> 01:22:16.331
county partners and so that it

01:22:16.398 --> 01:22:16.965
that's on our radar that we're

01:22:17.032 --> 01:22:18.500
looking to take advantage of as

01:22:18.566 --> 01:22:20.168
we move forward I encourage you

01:22:20.235 --> 01:22:20.769
to do. That because what it's

01:22:20.835 --> 01:22:21.369
something that we have heard

01:22:21.436 --> 01:22:22.203
our campus tours and other

01:22:22.270 --> 01:22:22.771
places where a lot of times

01:22:22.837 --> 01:22:24.506
that the college campuses are

01:22:24.572 --> 01:22:26.408
seen as like islands like it's

01:22:26.474 --> 01:22:28.176
we don't have to go there they

01:22:28.243 --> 01:22:28.677
kind of got their stuff

01:22:28.743 --> 01:22:30.378
together. And the counties

01:22:30.445 --> 01:22:32.080
completely ignored forgetting

01:22:32.147 --> 01:22:34.182
that if you're responding your

01:22:34.249 --> 01:22:34.783
basic needs of your community

01:22:34.849 --> 01:22:36.451
you can't just say that them

01:22:36.518 --> 01:22:40.155
and not us and we got a we got

01:22:40.221 --> 01:22:40.789
to reestablish that partnership

01:22:40.855 --> 01:22:42.290
and that obligation there so I

01:22:42.357 --> 01:22:46.361
hope that you work on that yeah

01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:46.961
absolutely. Thank you I thank

01:22:47.028 --> 01:22:50.231
you very. Jean anything else.

01:22:50.298 --> 01:22:52.634
Yes if I could just follow up

01:22:52.701 --> 01:22:54.302
on that so what steps. Does

01:22:54.369 --> 01:22:56.271
Dominguez hills take to

01:22:56.338 --> 01:22:56.871
identify the students who are

01:22:56.938 --> 01:23:00.342
cal fresh eligible. So do you

01:23:00.408 --> 01:23:02.310
want Anthony women he yeah

01:23:02.377 --> 01:23:04.212
steps wikihow fresh the end

01:23:04.279 --> 01:23:04.813
what what steps you take to

01:23:04.879 --> 01:23:06.481
identify the students who are

01:23:06.548 --> 01:23:08.350
cal fresh eligible and what

01:23:08.416 --> 01:23:10.518
would you do to encourage them

01:23:10.585 --> 01:23:12.420
to apply yeah of course so

01:23:12.487 --> 01:23:14.456
couple ways that we try to make

01:23:14.522 --> 01:23:16.424
sure that students are eligible

01:23:16.491 --> 01:23:16.991
is that we meet them where

01:23:17.058 --> 01:23:18.560
they're at so our coverage and

01:23:18.626 --> 01:23:20.261
turns are currently in

01:23:20.328 --> 01:23:22.330
different departments. As you

01:23:22.397 --> 01:23:24.399
may know we do have a coverage

01:23:24.466 --> 01:23:26.267
how fresh eligibility for

01:23:26.334 --> 01:23:28.269
students so if they have cal

01:23:28.336 --> 01:23:28.803
grant a RB they may look

01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:30.572
eligible if they work twenty

01:23:30.638 --> 01:23:32.607
hours per week or eighty hours

01:23:32.674 --> 01:23:34.542
per month they may look

01:23:34.609 --> 01:23:36.711
eligible if they are part of I.

01:23:36.778 --> 01:23:38.513
Toro guardian scholars foster

01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:40.548
you or are your P. programs

01:23:40.615 --> 01:23:42.617
they may look eligible. And so

01:23:42.684 --> 01:23:44.452
our students are also at the

01:23:44.519 --> 01:23:46.221
forefront at our farmers market

01:23:46.287 --> 01:23:48.390
so they can applied there so

01:23:48.456 --> 01:23:50.225
those are some ways that we're

01:23:50.291 --> 01:23:52.494
trying to catch the students in

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:54.462
C. they may look triple another

01:23:54.529 --> 01:23:56.331
resource that we provide within

01:23:56.398 --> 01:23:56.898
our basing these programs

01:23:56.965 --> 01:24:00.268
called a hot meal program and

01:24:00.335 --> 01:24:00.935
so students are able to receive

01:24:01.002 --> 01:24:02.437
this fifty dollar card but in

01:24:02.504 --> 01:24:04.472
order for them to receive it

01:24:04.539 --> 01:24:05.039
they have to go there khao

01:24:05.106 --> 01:24:06.574
freshen C. they are eligible

01:24:06.641 --> 01:24:08.410
for some benefits. So that's

01:24:08.476 --> 01:24:10.645
another way or another step

01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:12.380
that we are taking to ensure

01:24:12.447 --> 01:24:18.420
that students are. Obtaining

01:24:18.486 --> 01:24:19.020
sustainable food while they're

01:24:19.087 --> 01:24:24.325
here D. H. that are Bradford.

01:24:24.392 --> 01:24:24.959
Doctor but in all corners get.

01:24:25.026 --> 01:24:26.828
Okay very good well thank you

01:24:26.895 --> 01:24:27.462
for all your good work here. On

01:24:27.529 --> 01:24:28.696
the campus in such an important

01:24:28.763 --> 01:24:30.532
area that should not have any

01:24:30.598 --> 01:24:31.099
stigma to it whatsoever. And

01:24:31.166 --> 01:24:32.500
speaking of unfair statements.

01:24:32.567 --> 01:24:33.034
It's a great lead and the

01:24:33.101 --> 01:24:34.602
doctor Wallace in your work and

01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:35.203

and again my- my compliments

01:24:36.571 --> 01:24:38.273

01:24:38.339 --> 01:24:40.408
one way in which we saw. Just

01:24:40.475 --> 01:24:42.477
today and- just speaking

01:24:42.544 --> 01:24:44.446
honestly about mental health

01:24:44.512 --> 01:24:45.046
and mental health challenges

01:24:45.113 --> 01:24:46.815
and eliminating that stigma

01:24:46.881 --> 01:24:48.783
issue. Which is unfairly placed

01:24:48.850 --> 01:24:50.752
on those who are stressed. But

01:24:50.819 --> 01:24:52.554
we welcome you you're a

01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:56.357

opportunity. To speak about on

01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:06.734
mental health issues and the

01:25:06.801 --> 01:25:08.436
way in which we addressed those

01:25:08.503 --> 01:25:12.373
here at Dominguez hills so. I

01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:12.941
guess I would like to I've

01:25:13.007 --> 01:25:14.776
heard a lot about like the four

01:25:14.843 --> 01:25:16.511
year graduation process and

01:25:16.578 --> 01:25:18.313
I've been thinking a lot about

01:25:18.379 --> 01:25:18.813
that and what could be.

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:22.383
Interfering with that and is it

01:25:22.450 --> 01:25:22.951
has me thinking a lot about

01:25:23.017 --> 01:25:28.323
like my own Jerry. I went I was

01:25:28.389 --> 01:25:28.990
scholarship students so I went

01:25:29.057 --> 01:25:30.658
to school in the four years and

01:25:30.725 --> 01:25:32.393
in in the scholarship for

01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:34.329
undergrad. But my graduate

01:25:34.395 --> 01:25:34.963
journey was a little bit more

01:25:35.029 --> 01:25:36.698
difficult and it took a little

01:25:36.764 --> 01:25:38.666
bit longer. And when I reflect

01:25:38.733 --> 01:25:40.535
back on that I think one of the

01:25:40.602 --> 01:25:42.770
major challenges was something

01:25:42.837 --> 01:25:46.441
Connie imposter syndrome. And

01:25:46.508 --> 01:25:47.008
that was a lack of belief in

01:25:47.075 --> 01:25:48.643
myself a lack of belief that I

01:25:48.710 --> 01:25:50.478
deserve to be a doctor. And I

01:25:50.545 --> 01:25:52.447
think they got no way of me

01:25:52.514 --> 01:25:54.616
pursuing it as quickly as I

01:25:54.682 --> 01:25:56.584
could. With that comes a lot of

01:25:56.651 --> 01:26:00.522
data a lot of anxiety fear when

01:26:00.588 --> 01:26:02.423
you're at the finish line do I

01:26:02.490 --> 01:26:04.492
want to step out in. Not have

01:26:04.559 --> 01:26:06.427
to do this is Bob along here.

01:26:06.494 --> 01:26:08.563
And I think a lot of our

01:26:08.630 --> 01:26:09.197
students here to make you still

01:26:09.264 --> 01:26:10.398
struggle with that as well. You

01:26:10.465 --> 01:26:12.534
know. The sense of do they

01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:14.435
belong today deserve to be

01:26:14.502 --> 01:26:16.604
seen. Today deserve to have

01:26:16.671 --> 01:26:18.673
these things that they haven't

01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:22.477
had. Into their lives on it so

01:26:22.544 --> 01:26:23.044
a big part of the work that

01:26:23.111 --> 01:26:24.712
we've done is to reduce stigma.

01:26:24.779 --> 01:26:28.516
But also to empower students to

01:26:28.583 --> 01:26:32.353
recognize that. They have

01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:32.887
important voices important

01:26:32.954 --> 01:26:34.722
contributions to the world.

01:26:34.789 --> 01:26:40.461
They're. Not just. Afterthought.

01:26:40.528 --> 01:26:42.897
So I would like to talk a

01:26:42.964 --> 01:26:43.498
little bit about the services

01:26:43.565 --> 01:26:44.566
that we do provide here. At the

01:26:44.632 --> 01:26:45.166
counseling center so we do

01:26:45.233 --> 01:26:48.436
individual sessions group

01:26:48.503 --> 01:26:50.672
sessions we do crisis

01:26:50.738 --> 01:26:52.340
interventions so if a student

01:26:52.407 --> 01:26:54.542
is coming in with. Some acute

01:26:54.609 --> 01:26:56.511
crises they can come in and be

01:26:56.578 --> 01:26:58.513
seen that day. To just that

01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:00.582
issue. Aren't we also focus a

01:27:00.648 --> 01:27:02.584
lot on outreach. And senator

01:27:02.650 --> 01:27:04.919
Glazer you were speaking to the

01:27:04.986 --> 01:27:06.621
earlier where you saw the ways

01:27:06.688 --> 01:27:07.221
in which we kind of push the

01:27:07.288 --> 01:27:08.656
message out there. And let the

01:27:08.723 --> 01:27:10.758
students know that we're here

01:27:10.825 --> 01:27:12.760
to serve them. That's something

01:27:12.827 --> 01:27:16.598
that's a huge passion of my own

01:27:16.664 --> 01:27:20.602
because I found that. In order

01:27:20.668 --> 01:27:21.169
to get reduced at stake my

01:27:21.235 --> 01:27:22.604
number in to increase the level

01:27:22.670 --> 01:27:24.539
of comfort in being seen. By a

01:27:24.606 --> 01:27:26.441
therapist you got another

01:27:26.507 --> 01:27:28.509
therapist is. You know the

01:27:28.576 --> 01:27:30.445
students need to see our faces

01:27:30.511 --> 01:27:31.112
and see that we're we're normal

01:27:31.179 --> 01:27:32.880
people. You know. It's just the

01:27:32.947 --> 01:27:36.684
conversation. And once. They're

01:27:36.751 --> 01:27:38.620
able to connect the face to

01:27:38.686 --> 01:27:40.755
those services it becomes much

01:27:40.822 --> 01:27:42.624
more comfortable much more

01:27:42.690 --> 01:27:43.157
easier process within the

01:27:43.224 --> 01:27:44.892
coming in is and be helped by

01:27:44.959 --> 01:27:48.596
us. On and it's also a great

01:27:48.663 --> 01:27:49.197
opportunity to kind of just

01:27:49.263 --> 01:27:52.667
educate students in the public

01:27:52.734 --> 01:27:54.602
as a whole about. Mental

01:27:54.669 --> 01:27:58.439
health. It take away this kind

01:27:58.506 --> 01:28:02.610
of false idea that. You know

01:28:02.677 --> 01:28:03.211
Mitchell health struggles are

01:28:03.277 --> 01:28:03.778
something that other people

01:28:03.845 --> 01:28:06.881
have. When in fact all of us

01:28:06.948 --> 01:28:08.449
can relate to anxiety all of

01:28:08.516 --> 01:28:09.083
the related depression. And so

01:28:09.150 --> 01:28:10.785
it's a good way to kind of just

01:28:10.852 --> 01:28:12.620
like normalized that in just

01:28:12.687 --> 01:28:14.455
let students know that if they

01:28:14.522 --> 01:28:15.089
are experiencing things like

01:28:15.156 --> 01:28:16.858
that that's not a sign that you

01:28:16.924 --> 01:28:18.726
don't belong here. That is the

01:28:18.793 --> 01:28:19.293
side your normal human being

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:19.861
and we have ways to help you

01:28:19.927 --> 01:28:24.799
with that. And so. That's a big

01:28:24.866 --> 01:28:26.834
focus of ours just getting that

01:28:26.901 --> 01:28:28.770
getting that. Message out

01:28:28.836 --> 01:28:31.039
there. Something else I'd like

01:28:31.105 --> 01:28:32.707
to bring up to is in my work

01:28:32.774 --> 01:28:34.742
with students I've noticed that

01:28:34.809 --> 01:28:36.778
like. Not only life hidden away

01:28:36.844 --> 01:28:37.345
in terms of like having to

01:28:37.412 --> 01:28:40.648
work. But Sirius trauma like

01:28:40.715 --> 01:28:41.282
our students are dealing with.

01:28:41.349 --> 01:28:44.752
Real actual trauma. That a lot

01:28:44.819 --> 01:28:46.621
of our students are coming from

01:28:46.688 --> 01:28:47.155
communities where there's

01:28:47.221 --> 01:28:48.890
violence. Live where there's

01:28:48.956 --> 01:28:52.560
life or death issues going on.

01:28:52.627 --> 01:28:53.194
So those type of things kind of

01:28:53.261 --> 01:28:54.896
like. If we think about

01:28:54.962 --> 01:28:56.931
hierarchy of needs right. You

01:28:56.998 --> 01:28:58.800
know we need food we need

01:28:58.866 --> 01:29:00.635
shelter but we need to live and

01:29:00.702 --> 01:29:02.737
stay alive. And so if you're

01:29:02.804 --> 01:29:03.304
focused on that if you're

01:29:03.371 --> 01:29:04.939
focused on just surviving is

01:29:05.006 --> 01:29:06.941
very hard to kind of like had

01:29:07.008 --> 01:29:08.876
those extra mental resources

01:29:08.943 --> 01:29:10.912
available to do your algebra

01:29:10.978 --> 01:29:12.714
homework. Or things of that

01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:14.916
nature. And so for one many of

01:29:14.982 --> 01:29:17.085
us in the center we wanted to

01:29:17.151 --> 01:29:20.555
get like special we're wanting

01:29:20.621 --> 01:29:21.189
to really focus on that Tom and

01:29:21.255 --> 01:29:22.790
help his students process that

01:29:22.857 --> 01:29:24.926
trauma. So they can take away

01:29:24.992 --> 01:29:28.596
that have a place to kind of.

01:29:28.663 --> 01:29:30.565
The deal with that extra layer

01:29:30.631 --> 01:29:32.567
of psychological psychological

01:29:32.633 --> 01:29:34.669
stress and burden. That could

01:29:34.736 --> 01:29:36.671
interfere with just the ability

01:29:36.738 --> 01:29:37.271
to pay attention in class and

01:29:37.338 --> 01:29:40.742
things of that nature. So

01:29:40.808 --> 01:29:42.777
because we're short on time I

01:29:42.844 --> 01:29:43.411
like to just open up the floor

01:29:43.478 --> 01:29:44.679
for any questions you may have

01:29:44.746 --> 01:29:46.681
thank you doctor Wallace and I

01:29:46.748 --> 01:29:48.683
think that the reason. That

01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:49.250
we're talking about mental

01:29:49.317 --> 01:29:50.918
health is because for many of

01:29:50.985 --> 01:29:53.221
us we recognize that it it can

01:29:53.287 --> 01:29:56.657
be as important as food and

01:29:56.724 --> 01:29:57.225
housing it is that important

01:29:57.291 --> 01:29:57.759
and that statement doesn't

01:29:57.825 --> 01:30:00.862
belong. And can you I don't

01:30:00.928 --> 01:30:02.663
wanna put you on the spot can

01:30:02.730 --> 01:30:03.297
you tell me how big of a staff

01:30:03.364 --> 01:30:04.932
you have here at the at the

01:30:04.999 --> 01:30:06.768
university dealing in your

01:30:06.834 --> 01:30:08.669
counseling center. Up we have

01:30:08.736 --> 01:30:10.671
approximately ten of full time

01:30:10.738 --> 01:30:12.673
counselors and asked taking

01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:14.809
like if we combine some of the

01:30:14.876 --> 01:30:15.409
halftime counselors that's how

01:30:15.476 --> 01:30:16.844
we get that number of ten. And

01:30:16.911 --> 01:30:18.980
if I'm a student and I'm

01:30:19.046 --> 01:30:20.915
stressed out very stressed out

01:30:20.982 --> 01:30:22.850
and I call and I said like to

01:30:22.917 --> 01:30:23.451
come in for an appointment how

01:30:23.518 --> 01:30:25.186
long when I have to wait to get

01:30:25.253 --> 01:30:26.921
an appointment. Act honestly

01:30:26.988 --> 01:30:29.023
that depends on like the time

01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:30.825
of year that you Connie and so

01:30:30.892 --> 01:30:31.359
like there's certain high

01:30:31.425 --> 01:30:33.027
periods. Like let's say mid

01:30:33.094 --> 01:30:35.096
terms finals where we have a

01:30:35.163 --> 01:30:38.699
higher demand on our services.

01:30:38.766 --> 01:30:40.968
A in times like that there

01:30:41.035 --> 01:30:44.806
could be a significant weight

01:30:44.872 --> 01:30:45.406
time up between four to eight

01:30:45.473 --> 01:30:48.810
weeks right. I wanted to get

01:30:48.876 --> 01:30:49.443
the I wanted you to put that on

01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:50.812
the record because it's- it's a

01:30:50.878 --> 01:30:51.379
four day weeks they're right

01:30:51.445 --> 01:30:53.147
here that four to eight weeks.

01:30:53.214 --> 01:30:55.149
Just not acceptable. No that's

01:30:55.216 --> 01:30:57.018
not your fault I'm not don't

01:30:57.084 --> 01:30:58.853
get me wrong hidden but that

01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:00.788
that's not acceptable. And I we

01:31:00.855 --> 01:31:01.389
we've heard that when I was a

01:31:01.455 --> 01:31:04.692
trustee at the time at least.

01:31:04.759 --> 01:31:05.259
The testimony was that on

01:31:05.326 --> 01:31:08.696
average in the state among the

01:31:08.763 --> 01:31:09.230
twenty three campuses. The

01:31:09.297 --> 01:31:12.700
average wait time for students

01:31:12.767 --> 01:31:13.301
says I need some help. With

01:31:13.367 --> 01:31:15.169
three weeks. Andy here to make

01:31:15.236 --> 01:31:17.071
a sales when I look at the

01:31:17.138 --> 01:31:17.538
ratio of students to

01:31:17.605 --> 01:31:20.775
counselors. It's way below

01:31:20.842 --> 01:31:22.944
average yeah that's not good

01:31:23.010 --> 01:31:24.679
that's not your fault but

01:31:24.745 --> 01:31:25.279
that's the reality here. Is a

01:31:25.346 --> 01:31:27.315
lot yeah sockets and I. Just

01:31:27.381 --> 01:31:29.183
wanna I want to say that. It

01:31:29.250 --> 01:31:31.252
resource demands are everywhere

01:31:31.319 --> 01:31:33.054
on campus I get that we

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:35.056
understand that. And if there's

01:31:35.122 --> 01:31:36.791
things that we need to do in

01:31:36.858 --> 01:31:37.391
the legislature to help with

01:31:37.458 --> 01:31:39.126
that issue. I'm certainly want

01:31:39.193 --> 01:31:40.895
to step up first to be that

01:31:40.962 --> 01:31:43.097
help because- we have got to

01:31:43.164 --> 01:31:44.866
make sure that if kids are

01:31:44.932 --> 01:31:46.868
stressed out. Not suicidal

01:31:46.934 --> 01:31:47.501
there's a difference in I know

01:31:47.568 --> 01:31:48.903
that you would recognize that

01:31:48.970 --> 01:31:49.470
difference but- we cannot

01:31:49.537 --> 01:31:53.007
happen waiting four to six

01:31:53.074 --> 01:31:53.608
weeks. To get help that keeps

01:31:53.674 --> 01:31:58.746
them in in school it literally.

01:31:58.813 --> 01:31:59.313
Keep them in school happened

01:31:59.380 --> 01:31:59.881
drop out because they can't

01:31:59.947 --> 01:32:03.184
take it. And the signs that you

01:32:03.251 --> 01:32:03.784
had out there today was very

01:32:03.851 --> 01:32:05.086
powerful. Would you share a

01:32:05.152 --> 01:32:05.620
couple those messages the

01:32:05.686 --> 01:32:06.254
reality check on. The stressed

01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:07.154
out nature of your student body

01:32:07.221 --> 01:32:07.722
can you share some of those

01:32:07.788 --> 01:32:09.190
facts that you have on the

01:32:09.257 --> 01:32:12.894
sign. I don't know the exact

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:13.494
factory assigned record to

01:32:13.561 --> 01:32:15.062
speak from my experiences

01:32:15.129 --> 01:32:17.164
there. The number one thing

01:32:17.231 --> 01:32:19.033
that our students. Are

01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:21.002
struggling with is this

01:32:21.068 --> 01:32:22.870
anxiety. That's the number one

01:32:22.937 --> 01:32:24.805
thing that students are coming

01:32:24.872 --> 01:32:25.373
in for. Particularly things

01:32:25.439 --> 01:32:28.910
like testing side. You know.

01:32:28.976 --> 01:32:29.477
And I think again that ties

01:32:29.543 --> 01:32:32.980
back to like struggles. In

01:32:33.047 --> 01:32:35.016
terms of like believe that they

01:32:35.082 --> 01:32:36.918
belong that I'm here to do this

01:32:36.984 --> 01:32:37.551
you know. If you're struggling

01:32:37.618 --> 01:32:40.988
with that self belief. Of any

01:32:41.055 --> 01:32:43.124
kind of set back in a class

01:32:43.190 --> 01:32:45.092
like a bad. Scored a testament

01:32:45.159 --> 01:32:46.994
to sign me can reinforce this

01:32:47.061 --> 01:32:48.896
is that I don't know if this is

01:32:48.963 --> 01:32:50.898
for me. And so I think anxiety

01:32:50.965 --> 01:32:53.167
is the number one driver was

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:55.069
bringing students into our

01:32:55.136 --> 01:33:03.044
services. Also I think. A lack

01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:05.079
of sense of community. Right a

01:33:05.146 --> 01:33:07.148
sense of isolation because it's

01:33:07.214 --> 01:33:09.016
a huge transition coming from

01:33:09.083 --> 01:33:10.985
high school to university. N.

01:33:11.052 --> 01:33:13.254
transitions always bring stress

01:33:13.321 --> 01:33:14.956
with them and so I think.

01:33:15.022 --> 01:33:17.191
Experience in those those

01:33:17.258 --> 01:33:19.293
transitions and the stress that

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:20.928
come with those transitions

01:33:20.995 --> 01:33:22.997
kind of again fuels that

01:33:23.064 --> 01:33:25.132
anxiety innocence of

01:33:25.199 --> 01:33:27.034
disconnection the students on

01:33:27.101 --> 01:33:28.903
can feel on campus so I think a

01:33:28.970 --> 01:33:29.537
steps in as as a community is a

01:33:29.603 --> 01:33:32.940
very important thing as well.

01:33:33.007 --> 01:33:33.507
So I took a couple pictures

01:33:33.574 --> 01:33:37.078
some of the sign messages. One

01:33:37.144 --> 01:33:39.080
of them says that 76% of your

01:33:39.146 --> 01:33:39.613
students felt physically

01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:42.917
exhausted within the last

01:33:42.984 --> 01:33:43.417
twelve months seven six

01:33:43.484 --> 01:33:45.119
percent. Here's another one.

01:33:45.186 --> 01:33:49.023
35% I felt so depressed. That

01:33:49.090 --> 01:33:49.623
it was difficult for them to

01:33:49.690 --> 01:33:51.459
function within the last twelve

01:33:51.525 --> 01:33:53.427
months 35% said they were so

01:33:53.494 --> 01:33:55.296
depressed was difficult Steven

01:33:55.363 --> 01:33:57.398
function. There was another one

01:33:57.465 --> 01:33:59.166
on how many students you have

01:33:59.233 --> 01:34:01.035
contemplated suicide do I

01:34:01.102 --> 01:34:01.669
recall it right around 14% your

01:34:01.736 --> 01:34:05.439
number. Yeah so these are these

01:34:05.506 --> 01:34:09.010
are real powerful and scary and

01:34:09.076 --> 01:34:11.212
worries some facts. And I hope

01:34:11.278 --> 01:34:13.214
and I hope that we in the

01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:13.881
legislature in partnership with

01:34:13.948 --> 01:34:17.018
the campus can can do more. You

01:34:17.084 --> 01:34:19.020
need more help yes I'm I need

01:34:19.086 --> 01:34:21.088
more staff definitely okay. We

01:34:21.155 --> 01:34:21.589
mostly got to find a way

01:34:21.655 --> 01:34:23.357
through that pathway it's very

01:34:23.424 --> 01:34:25.192
very important he so we're

01:34:25.259 --> 01:34:25.860
gonna open we're gonna close in

01:34:25.926 --> 01:34:27.461
just a moment. But I want to

01:34:27.528 --> 01:34:29.397
mention that at all of our

01:34:29.463 --> 01:34:30.031
public hearings in the Senate

01:34:30.097 --> 01:34:31.465
and the assembly we have an

01:34:31.532 --> 01:34:33.134
opportunity for public hearing.

01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:35.269
For anyone who would like to

01:34:35.336 --> 01:34:35.903
share some thoughts with us and

01:34:35.970 --> 01:34:36.570
we're going to provide for that

01:34:36.637 --> 01:34:37.571
in just a moment. But I want to

01:34:37.638 --> 01:34:39.407
give my colleagues on the panel

01:34:39.473 --> 01:34:41.342
the chance to ask any follow up

01:34:41.409 --> 01:34:41.909
questions and then closing

01:34:41.976 --> 01:34:43.544
remarks. Well first off I'd

01:34:43.611 --> 01:34:44.078
like to say thank you to

01:34:44.145 --> 01:34:45.312
everyone. But I'd like to

01:34:45.379 --> 01:34:49.316
apologize. I'd like to

01:34:49.383 --> 01:34:51.352
apologize. Because. When we

01:34:51.419 --> 01:34:53.454
started I said I wanted to

01:34:53.521 --> 01:34:55.222
listen. And not only did I

01:34:55.289 --> 01:34:55.856
listen but I heard you loud and

01:34:55.923 --> 01:34:57.491
clear. You're dealing with

01:34:57.558 --> 01:34:59.393
students that come from all

01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:01.195
kinds of background the

01:35:01.262 --> 01:35:03.264
diversity. That is here number

01:35:03.330 --> 01:35:05.332
one. In the system as far as

01:35:05.399 --> 01:35:07.468
diversity. The need financial

01:35:07.535 --> 01:35:09.370
economic that that is

01:35:09.437 --> 01:35:11.439
devastating and somehow full.

01:35:11.505 --> 01:35:13.574
Of and you're dealing with

01:35:13.641 --> 01:35:15.443
every kind of student. So we

01:35:15.509 --> 01:35:17.611
may have walked in here gave me

01:35:17.678 --> 01:35:19.346
the impression was. Why aren't

01:35:19.413 --> 01:35:21.248
these numbers right. Why are

01:35:21.315 --> 01:35:23.317
these numbers I see. Nine point

01:35:23.384 --> 01:35:23.918
five when I looked down the

01:35:23.984 --> 01:35:27.121
list and- and I C. San Diego at

01:35:27.188 --> 01:35:29.190
forty six point six. I see she

01:35:29.256 --> 01:35:31.559
co at ninety twenty nine fuller

01:35:31.625 --> 01:35:32.126
Janet twenty five in your at

01:35:32.193 --> 01:35:37.131
night. You may have thought

01:35:37.198 --> 01:35:37.698
that's how we came in. Well

01:35:37.765 --> 01:35:39.200
maybe we get I apologize for

01:35:39.266 --> 01:35:41.302
that because now I know that if

01:35:41.368 --> 01:35:43.404
you had the scale balance. In a

01:35:43.471 --> 01:35:45.239
lot of different ways this

01:35:45.306 --> 01:35:47.274
thing would get the other way

01:35:47.341 --> 01:35:49.510
around. You would be in that

01:35:49.577 --> 01:35:50.044
eighty and ninety percent.

01:35:50.111 --> 01:35:53.581
Sorry. Because I had mentioned

01:35:53.647 --> 01:35:55.549
earlier that I had to send to

01:35:55.616 --> 01:35:57.218
graduate from west point. And

01:35:57.284 --> 01:35:59.620
then I tell you about my one of

01:35:59.687 --> 01:36:03.257
my daughters. And she graduated

01:36:03.324 --> 01:36:03.824
from Chapman college but she

01:36:03.891 --> 01:36:05.259
graduated with four kids. And a

01:36:05.326 --> 01:36:09.230
husband that they had. Some

01:36:09.296 --> 01:36:09.864
physical problems because of an

01:36:09.930 --> 01:36:13.234
accident and she would not stop

01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:17.138
going to school yes I help yes

01:36:17.204 --> 01:36:17.805
my wife and I bush the bush she

01:36:17.872 --> 01:36:19.573
had the family when she finally

01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:21.575
made it but with four kids in

01:36:21.642 --> 01:36:23.210
the classroom sometimes so

01:36:23.277 --> 01:36:25.412
imagine that scale so I've told

01:36:25.479 --> 01:36:27.815
her that you get a much better

01:36:27.882 --> 01:36:29.683
than your brothers. At west

01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:31.519
point it didn't have to worry

01:36:31.585 --> 01:36:33.420
about tuition you have to worry

01:36:33.487 --> 01:36:34.021
about anything but you had to

01:36:34.088 --> 01:36:37.258
worry about those for kids so.

01:36:37.324 --> 01:36:39.160
You've changed my mind I tell

01:36:39.226 --> 01:36:41.262
you the support that I wanna

01:36:41.328 --> 01:36:43.464
root for and fight for is not

01:36:43.531 --> 01:36:45.466
just the academics on this side

01:36:45.533 --> 01:36:47.535
but the things that you need

01:36:47.601 --> 01:36:49.403
you need additional teachers

01:36:49.470 --> 01:36:51.305
you need professor you need

01:36:51.372 --> 01:36:53.407
more help financially you need

01:36:53.474 --> 01:36:55.309
these kids will be able to

01:36:55.376 --> 01:36:59.380
survive that last few months so

01:36:59.446 --> 01:37:00.047
we're gonna look into that and

01:37:00.114 --> 01:37:01.315
I'm going to recommend that. To

01:37:01.382 --> 01:37:03.551
senator Glazer that we could

01:37:03.617 --> 01:37:05.252
help in a lot of different ways

01:37:05.319 --> 01:37:07.321
these numbers will change to

01:37:07.388 --> 01:37:07.955
god bless you for what you're

01:37:08.022 --> 01:37:11.358
doing you're taking this

01:37:11.425 --> 01:37:11.992
challenge. And you meet it head

01:37:12.059 --> 01:37:17.531
on. Thank you. So I wanna let

01:37:17.598 --> 01:37:19.400
the other colleagues at some

01:37:19.466 --> 01:37:21.435
closing remarks M. ago that

01:37:21.502 --> 01:37:22.036
senator Bradford and assembly

01:37:22.102 --> 01:37:25.406
member next. Again let me think

01:37:25.472 --> 01:37:26.006
US senator Glazer for putting

01:37:26.073 --> 01:37:27.541
this hearing on to give him a

01:37:27.608 --> 01:37:29.443
round of applause for. This

01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:30.044
important issue our students

01:37:30.110 --> 01:37:31.579
six Josh. And we heard a lot of

01:37:31.645 --> 01:37:33.581
challenges and obstacles that

01:37:33.647 --> 01:37:35.482
error impeding a student's.

01:37:35.549 --> 01:37:39.253
Ability to graduate and it's

01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:41.255
clear that we have to refocus

01:37:41.322 --> 01:37:41.689
our priorities the

01:37:41.755 --> 01:37:43.557
legislature's well because for

01:37:43.624 --> 01:37:45.659
the last twenty years our main

01:37:45.726 --> 01:37:47.561
focus has been about admissions

01:37:47.628 --> 01:37:49.330
getting your number's up

01:37:49.396 --> 01:37:49.897
getting your number's up

01:37:49.964 --> 01:37:51.432
getting your numbers out. For

01:37:51.498 --> 01:37:53.500
the most important are just as

01:37:53.567 --> 01:37:54.068
important is getting those

01:37:54.134 --> 01:37:55.603
graduation numbers up and we

01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:59.273
have to refocus our priorities

01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:01.275
now because we've been talking

01:38:01.342 --> 01:38:01.842
about admission since ward

01:38:01.909 --> 01:38:03.677
Connelly and how do we- provide

01:38:03.744 --> 01:38:05.479
a diverse student body but-

01:38:05.546 --> 01:38:07.481
it's not enough to get him in

01:38:07.548 --> 01:38:09.383
the door we got to get a mop.

01:38:09.450 --> 01:38:11.252
Toward well as graduate so

01:38:11.318 --> 01:38:11.852
that's going to be I party and

01:38:11.919 --> 01:38:15.356
I knows senator Glazer about

01:38:15.422 --> 01:38:17.524
the remediation and that's of

01:38:17.591 --> 01:38:19.460
great importance because the

01:38:19.526 --> 01:38:21.362
legislative black caucus were

01:38:21.428 --> 01:38:23.497
our service device year. We did

01:38:23.564 --> 01:38:25.332
a tour two years ago and

01:38:25.399 --> 01:38:27.268
visited a variety of students

01:38:27.334 --> 01:38:29.270
throughout the state of

01:38:29.336 --> 01:38:35.309
California and we realize.

01:38:35.376 --> 01:38:35.876
Regards to work that kid in

01:38:35.943 --> 01:38:43.450
front of you. It's far more

01:38:43.517 --> 01:38:44.051
clear she was far more likely

01:38:44.118 --> 01:38:45.286
to remediate and repeat classes

01:38:45.352 --> 01:38:45.886
that they had already taken.

01:38:45.953 --> 01:38:47.921
Yet ance calculus you name it

01:38:47.988 --> 01:38:48.522
AP courses they had to do it

01:38:48.589 --> 01:38:49.890
more so than their counterparts

01:38:49.957 --> 01:38:50.424
and I think it speaks to

01:38:50.491 --> 01:38:51.692
something we fell to talk about

01:38:51.759 --> 01:38:52.326
as well when we look at these

01:38:52.393 --> 01:38:53.460
numbers and when I saw the nine

01:38:53.527 --> 01:38:55.496
percent. I wasn't judging cal

01:38:55.562 --> 01:38:56.130
state Dominguez hills but I can

01:38:56.196 --> 01:38:59.366
implicit bias that we face.

01:38:59.433 --> 01:39:01.435
People of color. And

01:39:01.502 --> 01:39:02.069
educational system and housing

01:39:02.136 --> 01:39:05.372
and all those challenges so

01:39:05.439 --> 01:39:06.006
that's the issue that needs to

01:39:06.073 --> 01:39:07.641
be talked about as well M.

01:39:07.708 --> 01:39:09.376
needs to be addressed implicit

01:39:09.443 --> 01:39:10.010
bias that still exist. And our

01:39:10.077 --> 01:39:13.380
education system. And how do we

01:39:13.447 --> 01:39:13.914
fix that and it won't be

01:39:13.981 --> 01:39:15.449
overnight but it's gonna be

01:39:15.516 --> 01:39:17.651
through. Being willing to have

01:39:17.718 --> 01:39:21.388
honest dialogue. And I and

01:39:21.455 --> 01:39:22.022
working with individuals such

01:39:22.089 --> 01:39:23.724
as yourself to deal with this

01:39:23.791 --> 01:39:25.726
on a daily basis so I'm

01:39:25.793 --> 01:39:29.363
recommitted myself as a- alarm

01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:31.498
of this fine university I know

01:39:31.565 --> 01:39:32.066
what that commitment is. No

01:39:32.132 --> 01:39:33.767
hard work you're doing to. Take

01:39:33.834 --> 01:39:35.602
message out and recruit young

01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:37.805
people who are have the biggest

01:39:37.871 --> 01:39:39.740
challenges some time to get to

01:39:39.807 --> 01:39:41.675
college and we need to find a

01:39:41.742 --> 01:39:43.544
way to X. I'll he did have one

01:39:43.610 --> 01:39:44.144
question. Of the housing the

01:39:44.211 --> 01:39:49.783
units. That you have are they

01:39:49.850 --> 01:39:53.420
pretty much bill your round.

01:39:53.487 --> 01:39:55.389
Honestly it just really depends

01:39:55.456 --> 01:39:55.989
on when our students need it

01:39:56.056 --> 01:39:56.557
but I. Spring semester was

01:39:56.623 --> 01:39:59.426
filled for the whole semester.

01:39:59.493 --> 01:40:00.094
Great thank you center Bradford

01:40:09.570 --> 01:40:11.739
just wanna wrap up by the

thanking everyone for a- your

01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:15.676
presentation I think one of the

01:40:15.743 --> 01:40:17.511
challenges that we face. As as

01:40:17.578 --> 01:40:19.580
California lawmakers is that in

01:40:19.646 --> 01:40:21.548
a while we are working so hard

01:40:21.615 --> 01:40:23.584
to expand access to. Higher

01:40:23.650 --> 01:40:25.452
education opportunities for

01:40:25.519 --> 01:40:27.621
all. That as as- you know

01:40:27.688 --> 01:40:29.590
college education has become.

01:40:29.656 --> 01:40:31.392
You know what used to be

01:40:31.458 --> 01:40:32.025
primarily the province of the

01:40:32.092 --> 01:40:35.396
middle class. In in decades

01:40:35.462 --> 01:40:37.498
past that now we are. You know

01:40:37.564 --> 01:40:39.466
reaching out and bringing in.

01:40:39.533 --> 01:40:41.402
You know because so many

01:40:41.468 --> 01:40:43.504
diverse populations with with

01:40:43.570 --> 01:40:44.138
different challenges and I and

01:40:44.204 --> 01:40:45.406
I think your presentations

01:40:45.472 --> 01:40:47.474
really. You know reminded us

01:40:47.541 --> 01:40:49.576
that that with. The expanded

01:40:49.643 --> 01:40:51.879
axis comes expanded challenges

01:40:51.945 --> 01:40:55.616
and expand across. It all right

01:40:55.682 --> 01:40:57.785
I wanted to follow up good

01:40:57.851 --> 01:40:59.686
looks like we're running out of

01:40:59.753 --> 01:41:01.622
time I know what. Sir Glazer

01:41:01.688 --> 01:41:02.256

01:42:19.633 --> 01:42:21.602
and more conversations could

01:42:21.668 --> 01:42:22.302

my name is Carolyn to no go.

01:42:31.645 --> 01:42:33.514
And I'm a graduate student

01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:34.147
studying public administration

01:42:34.214 --> 01:42:35.916
you're entering a sales we're

01:42:35.983 --> 01:42:37.818
also earned my undergrad degree

01:42:37.885 --> 01:42:39.820
in business. Little fact about

01:42:39.887 --> 01:42:41.889
myself is that I enjoy taking

01:42:41.955 --> 01:42:43.857
surveys. When I transfer to

01:42:43.924 --> 01:42:45.759
Dominguez hills. It from City

01:42:45.826 --> 01:42:47.694
College of San Francisco

01:42:47.761 --> 01:42:48.195
answered an email that

01:42:48.262 --> 01:42:50.030
contained a survey entitled the

01:42:50.097 --> 01:42:53.634
C. S. U. food and housing.

01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:55.936
Housing security survey. That

01:42:56.003 --> 01:42:57.638
survey. Search hello. Now we

01:42:57.704 --> 01:42:58.338
all know that one in every four

01:42:58.405 --> 01:42:59.973
CSU student is food insecure

01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:01.975
and one in every ten our

01:43:02.042 --> 01:43:03.844
housing and secure. I myself am

01:43:03.911 --> 01:43:05.946
currently housing and secure

01:43:06.013 --> 01:43:09.816
and don't have permanent.

01:43:09.883 --> 01:43:10.350
Residency due to high cost

01:43:10.417 --> 01:43:14.087
right. Basic needs and so basic

01:43:14.154 --> 01:43:15.756
needs support and mental health

01:43:15.822 --> 01:43:16.323
care is vital for students

01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:16.957
successful and because I'm very

01:43:17.024 --> 01:43:17.824
passionate about. I currently

01:43:17.891 --> 01:43:19.893
serve as the AS I. director of

01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:21.795
legislative affairs. And last

01:43:21.862 --> 01:43:23.797
year I was the executive vice

01:43:23.864 --> 01:43:24.398
president for finance for the

01:43:24.464 --> 01:43:25.999
cal state student association.

01:43:26.066 --> 01:43:28.068
I've shared my story of food

01:43:28.135 --> 01:43:30.003
and security as well because at

01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:31.805
one point during my undergrad

01:43:31.872 --> 01:43:33.974
years I held for part time jobs

01:43:34.041 --> 01:43:35.709
during the semester just to

01:43:35.776 --> 01:43:37.945
make ends meet. Students should

01:43:38.011 --> 01:43:38.478
not have to print choose

01:43:38.545 --> 01:43:39.913
between graduation or

01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:41.882
groceries. Since the basic

01:43:41.949 --> 01:43:44.017
needs basic needs conference

01:43:44.084 --> 01:43:45.686
that happened in Sacramento in

01:43:45.752 --> 01:43:47.754
two thousand eighteen. I mean

01:43:47.821 --> 01:43:48.355
it does has made great strides

01:43:48.422 --> 01:43:53.694
in addressing stern Gaines. We

01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:54.294
have three food pantries a hot

01:43:54.361 --> 01:43:55.829
meal card program. Graham an

01:43:55.896 --> 01:43:58.065
urban farm and a market match

01:43:58.131 --> 01:43:58.665
program at a farmer's market

01:43:58.732 --> 01:43:59.299
for students who currently have

01:43:59.366 --> 01:43:59.933
coverage benefits. I also

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.868
currently work part time as the

01:44:01.935 --> 01:44:03.704
caliphate food coordinator on

01:44:03.770 --> 01:44:04.338
campus. During the first week

01:44:04.404 --> 01:44:06.073
of school me and my intern

01:44:06.139 --> 01:44:07.975
signed up over forty five

01:44:08.041 --> 01:44:09.743
students for cal fresh

01:44:09.810 --> 01:44:10.310
benefits. But there's still

01:44:10.377 --> 01:44:11.912
more we can do. Passing

01:44:11.979 --> 01:44:13.981
legislation that makes the cal

01:44:14.047 --> 01:44:15.916
fresh program a more seamless

01:44:15.983 --> 01:44:16.516
process for students. So they

01:44:16.583 --> 01:44:18.051
can be approved for more

01:44:18.118 --> 01:44:20.053
benefits can help more funding

01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:21.922
for the cal grant program so

01:44:21.989 --> 01:44:23.857
that students can have access

01:44:23.924 --> 01:44:25.859
to financial aid. Art and here

01:44:25.926 --> 01:44:27.728
on campus opening a larger food

01:44:27.794 --> 01:44:29.630
pantry would definitely help

01:44:29.696 --> 01:44:31.632
us. I know that everyone in

01:44:31.698 --> 01:44:32.199
this room cares about this

01:44:32.265 --> 01:44:34.034
issue. And we should all you

01:44:34.101 --> 01:44:36.069
need to come together to find

01:44:36.136 --> 01:44:37.704
innovative ways to ensure all

01:44:37.771 --> 01:44:39.740
to me still still still safe

01:44:39.806 --> 01:44:43.810
secure and supported. Thank you

01:44:43.877 --> 01:44:44.378
again for your time thank I

01:44:44.444 --> 01:44:47.714
thank. Thank. Thank you for

01:44:47.781 --> 01:44:48.348
sharing your personal story as

01:44:48.415 --> 01:44:49.016
well as your leadership on this

01:44:49.082 --> 01:44:49.883
issue on the app is very much

01:44:49.950 --> 01:44:50.484
appreciated thank you so much.

01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:54.154
Yes. Hello my name is hawk make

01:44:54.221 --> 01:44:55.989
beds and I am the graduate

01:44:56.056 --> 01:44:57.891
research in terms of the basic

01:44:57.958 --> 01:44:59.860
needs department I'm also my

01:44:59.926 --> 01:45:01.828
master's thesis is funded in

01:45:01.895 --> 01:45:02.496
part by the chancellor's office

01:45:02.562 --> 01:45:05.732
and basic needs grants. I'm

01:45:05.799 --> 01:45:06.333
encouraged that psychological

01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:08.135
wellness is part of the basic

01:45:08.201 --> 01:45:09.870
needs conversation now. Of and

01:45:09.936 --> 01:45:13.740
I want to also suggest that

01:45:13.807 --> 01:45:14.374
financial wellness be included

01:45:14.441 --> 01:45:18.045
in the Maslow hierarchy

01:45:18.111 --> 01:45:20.013
actually my live park you could

01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:21.848
probably be. Dismissed and-

01:45:21.915 --> 01:45:23.817
favor of a more holistic

01:45:23.884 --> 01:45:24.418
solution. Including financial

01:45:24.484 --> 01:45:27.754
wellness environmentalists

01:45:27.821 --> 01:45:28.221
which can address the

01:45:28.288 --> 01:45:30.090
environments that our students

01:45:30.157 --> 01:45:31.825
are coming from as well as

01:45:31.892 --> 01:45:35.896
transportation issues. I want

01:45:35.962 --> 01:45:37.798
to suggest cultural wellness be.

01:45:37.864 --> 01:45:38.432
Part of psychological wellness

01:45:38.498 --> 01:45:40.167
but its own so culturally

01:45:40.233 --> 01:45:42.035
competent courses and of

01:45:42.102 --> 01:45:44.104
environment that is gorgeous.

01:45:44.171 --> 01:45:45.972
Culturally competent and

01:45:46.039 --> 01:45:47.741
culturally responsive to our

01:45:47.808 --> 01:45:48.341
students from where they come

01:45:48.408 --> 01:45:50.210
from. And also social wellness

01:45:50.277 --> 01:45:52.012
which includes childcare which

01:45:52.079 --> 01:45:53.914
is a real need I'm very

01:45:53.980 --> 01:45:55.882
preliminary findings from a

01:45:55.949 --> 01:45:56.516
study that I'm doing right now

01:45:56.583 --> 01:45:58.218
points to child care. As one of

01:45:58.285 --> 01:45:59.886
the life things that happens

01:45:59.953 --> 01:46:01.955
I'm not just having a child but

01:46:02.022 --> 01:46:03.857
dealing with when they get sick

01:46:03.924 --> 01:46:04.391
where do we put them when

01:46:04.458 --> 01:46:04.958
they're on spring break and

01:46:05.025 --> 01:46:07.961
we're not. I'm as far as

01:46:08.028 --> 01:46:09.763
becoming. Pretty campus which

01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:11.898
I'm really I'm a big fan of

01:46:11.965 --> 01:46:13.800
that wording and that mission.

01:46:13.867 --> 01:46:16.036
Over the summer as the former

01:46:16.103 --> 01:46:17.938
cal fresh coordinator over the

01:46:18.004 --> 01:46:19.773
summer I worked well worked

01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:20.440
with them the foundation on our

01:46:20.507 --> 01:46:22.109
campus and with campus dining

01:46:22.175 --> 01:46:23.777
to try to get easy T.

01:46:23.844 --> 01:46:24.377
implemented on our campus and

01:46:24.444 --> 01:46:26.213
EBT readers are students can

01:46:26.279 --> 01:46:28.048
have a place. To spend their

01:46:28.115 --> 01:46:29.916
cow fresh dollars currently

01:46:29.983 --> 01:46:31.918
there's no guidance from the

01:46:31.985 --> 01:46:33.754
that I could find from the

01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:34.387
chancellor's office or from the

01:46:34.454 --> 01:46:37.824
state to the systems. To try to

01:46:37.891 --> 01:46:38.458
streamline that process and I'm

01:46:38.525 --> 01:46:41.762
not sure if I would just wasn't

01:46:41.828 --> 01:46:42.362
looking in the right places or

01:46:42.429 --> 01:46:43.830
not. But I basically. It and

01:46:43.897 --> 01:46:46.133
there's no personal key point

01:46:46.199 --> 01:46:48.135
person within the financial

01:46:48.201 --> 01:46:50.170
management system that it would

01:46:50.237 --> 01:46:51.938
be required to do that or would

01:46:52.005 --> 01:46:53.774
have that guidance to do that

01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:54.307
and it's basically up to

01:46:54.374 --> 01:46:56.042
whoever at the university from

01:46:56.109 --> 01:46:58.145
what I've been able to see can

01:46:58.211 --> 01:47:00.147
do that. Some of the people

01:47:00.213 --> 01:47:01.982
that were helping our student

01:47:02.048 --> 01:47:03.850
workers and you may or may not

01:47:03.917 --> 01:47:04.451
know that student workers are

01:47:04.518 --> 01:47:06.186
restricted to twenty hours a

01:47:06.253 --> 01:47:08.321
week. So they're not able to

01:47:08.388 --> 01:47:09.923
work a full time job. Many of

01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:11.858
those students are also. Some

01:47:11.925 --> 01:47:13.927
of the ones were sleeping in

01:47:13.994 --> 01:47:14.461
their cars and are worried

01:47:14.528 --> 01:47:15.128
about whether meal is going to

01:47:15.195 --> 01:47:17.931
be coming from. So what can we

01:47:17.998 --> 01:47:18.532
do as far as student worker

01:47:18.598 --> 01:47:21.768
rates go increasing those maybe

01:47:21.835 --> 01:47:23.904
relaxing that our requirement I

01:47:23.970 --> 01:47:24.571
don't know what the solution is

01:47:24.638 --> 01:47:26.373
I know that their students are

01:47:26.439 --> 01:47:28.108
in need though. I appreciate

01:47:28.175 --> 01:47:30.010
the fact the efforts our

01:47:30.076 --> 01:47:32.078
faculty and of being de facto.

01:47:32.145 --> 01:47:35.882
Psychologists when they're on a

01:47:35.949 --> 01:47:36.516
six week waiting time I know I

01:47:36.583 --> 01:47:38.185
use them. As as such I'm not

01:47:38.251 --> 01:47:40.120
sure if they're- prepared for

01:47:40.187 --> 01:47:43.890
that all the time. I understand

01:47:43.957 --> 01:47:44.524
that when you have you really

01:47:44.591 --> 01:47:46.226
want to increase awareness for

01:47:46.293 --> 01:47:47.894
programs that are on campus.

01:47:47.961 --> 01:47:48.461
It's really hard to do that

01:47:48.528 --> 01:47:51.898
when you have one person

01:47:51.965 --> 01:47:52.465
running your programs of. As

01:47:52.532 --> 01:47:55.969
far as. Increasing if we're

01:47:56.036 --> 01:47:56.469
going to be. Of student

01:47:56.536 --> 01:47:58.171
centered scampers but has

01:47:58.238 --> 01:47:58.772
students living on campus we

01:47:58.839 --> 01:48:02.008
need to create. Faculty of I'm

01:48:02.075 --> 01:48:02.642
sorry family housing. As well

01:48:02.709 --> 01:48:04.211
as a dining hall. And the last

01:48:04.277 --> 01:48:05.979
thing that I haven't heard

01:48:06.046 --> 01:48:06.513
mentioned in this entire

01:48:06.580 --> 01:48:08.181
hearing is the needs of

01:48:08.248 --> 01:48:08.782
undocumented and makes that a

01:48:08.849 --> 01:48:10.116
student's. They are not

01:48:10.183 --> 01:48:12.219
eligible for cal for ash or

01:48:12.285 --> 01:48:14.254
many state and county. Services

01:48:14.321 --> 01:48:16.356
and there and the most of some

01:48:16.423 --> 01:48:18.024
of the most need they're eating

01:48:18.091 --> 01:48:18.525
out of the candy dishes

01:48:18.592 --> 01:48:22.128
sometimes. So this concludes my

01:48:22.195 --> 01:48:22.696
thoughts thank you thank you

01:48:22.762 --> 01:48:24.030
thank you hi thank you for

01:48:24.097 --> 01:48:27.934
coming and sharing. Thoughts.

01:48:28.001 --> 01:48:28.568
All right anyone else before we

01:48:28.635 --> 01:48:29.169
close the public hearing part

01:48:29.236 --> 01:48:30.270
of our- alright. Well let me

01:48:30.337 --> 01:48:32.072
just say in summing up but

01:48:32.138 --> 01:48:32.739
thank you to the university for

01:48:32.806 --> 01:48:34.241
having us here provost back.

01:48:34.307 --> 01:48:36.209
Thank you. For all your

01:48:36.276 --> 01:48:38.011
hospitality and that of your

01:48:38.078 --> 01:48:38.678
staff doctor goal thank you for

01:48:38.745 --> 01:48:40.113
your continuing work on the

01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:42.082
system. Our graduation

01:48:42.148 --> 01:48:43.984
initiative doctor Figueroa

01:48:44.050 --> 01:48:44.651
thank you for your work here on

01:48:44.718 --> 01:48:46.219
the campus. More conversation

01:48:46.286 --> 01:48:48.288
still to have. A doctor Thomas

01:48:48.355 --> 01:48:50.156
thank you in the faculty again

01:48:50.223 --> 01:48:52.058
and the staff for all the to

01:48:52.125 --> 01:48:52.592
help. Make our students

01:48:52.659 --> 01:48:56.263
successful. Miss Kirk thank you

01:48:56.329 --> 01:48:56.830
for the great work in basic

01:48:56.897 --> 01:48:58.265
needs that you do. And doctor

01:48:58.331 --> 01:49:00.000
Wallace thank you for. This

01:49:00.066 --> 01:49:00.500
bringing us some start

01:49:00.567 --> 01:49:02.435
testimony that's very important

01:49:02.502 --> 01:49:04.070
that the apart all the

01:49:04.137 --> 01:49:04.638
conversations we have. About

01:49:04.704 --> 01:49:08.141
student success. I'm I know

01:49:08.208 --> 01:49:10.277
this that that Dominguez hills

01:49:10.343 --> 01:49:11.912
is a very special university

01:49:11.978 --> 01:49:14.080
here in California. And

01:49:14.147 --> 01:49:14.748
California as a state cannot be

01:49:14.814 --> 01:49:16.316
successful. Unless Dominguez

01:49:16.383 --> 01:49:18.485
hills is successful that means

01:49:18.551 --> 01:49:20.153
all the students that are

01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:21.988
enrolled here on the campus.

01:49:22.055 --> 01:49:22.522
And I think all of us are

01:49:22.589 --> 01:49:23.156
committed to doing everything

01:49:23.223 --> 01:49:26.192
we can in partnership. To make

01:49:26.259 --> 01:49:26.860
our university here even more

01:49:26.927 --> 01:49:28.261
successful. So that every

01:49:28.328 --> 01:49:30.363
student can thrive at every

01:49:30.430 --> 01:49:32.465
level. Because they have a roof

01:49:32.532 --> 01:49:33.066
over their head because they

01:49:33.133 --> 01:49:34.367
have food. In their stomach

01:49:34.434 --> 01:49:36.169
because we're taking care. Of

01:49:36.236 --> 01:49:38.271
mental challenges that they may

01:49:38.338 --> 01:49:40.440
face. And because we've created

01:49:40.507 --> 01:49:42.375
pathways for success. To your

01:49:42.442 --> 01:49:46.112
pathways for transfers. Four

01:49:46.179 --> 01:49:48.248
year pathways. For freshmen

01:49:48.315 --> 01:49:50.016
students we can do that and I

01:49:50.083 --> 01:49:50.650
know you're all committed to it

01:49:50.717 --> 01:49:52.352
so I think all those who have

01:49:52.419 --> 01:49:52.852
participated here in the

01:49:52.919 --> 01:49:54.187
audience and those watching.

01:49:54.254 --> 01:49:56.222
And with that ladies and

01:49:56.289 --> 01:49:56.790
gentleman are a- hearing is

01:49:56.856 --> 01:50:12.038
adjourned
