CENTER BRADFORD THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND I STAND HERE TODAY HONORED TO PRESENT AB. FOURTEEN SIXTY. HI ETHNIC STUDIES BILL OUR REQUIREMENT FOR CAL STATE UNIVERSITY. VETERANS PART OF THE FIGHT AGAINST RACISM REQUIRES US TO INCREASE OUR UNDERSTANDING. ONE ANOTHER IN OUR HISTORY. WE NEED STUDENTS TO KNOW. NOT ONLY OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF WHITE AMERICANS BUT OF BLACK LATINO ASIAN AND NATIVE AMERICANS AND THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS. COUNTRY. FOR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS WE HAVE SANITIZED AND WHITEWASHED HISTORY FULL OF LIES WELL AND THE NILES. NOT SO TIME FOR THE TRUTH BECAUSE THAT BECAUSE AS WE KNOW THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE. JAMES BALDWIN ONCE STATED GREAT THE GREAT FORCE OF THREE COUNTS FROM THAT WE CARRY IT WITHIN OPS. OUR UNCONSCIOUSLY CONTROLLED ARE UNCONSCIOUSLY CONTROLLED IN MANY WAYS AND OUR HISTORY IS LERI PRESIDENT AND ALL THAT WE DO. FOR STUDENTS DO NOT UNDERSTAND THAT FOR FOUR HUNDRED YEAR HISTORY A WHITE SUPREMACY AND SUBJUGATION IN THIS COUNTRY HOW CAN THEY UNDERSTAND THE MOMENT OF NOW. THE LEGACY OF THAT HISTORY IS STILL ALL AROUND US TODAY. IT'S VISIBLE IN WHO CAN BUY A HOUSE AND WERE YOU CAN BUY A HOUSE DUE TO RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AND RED LINING THERE ONCE EXISTED. IT'S VISIBLE AND WHOSE INCARCERATED. AND WHO'S NOT BECAUSE OF THE LEGACY OF SLAVERY IN THE THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT THE WAR ON DRUGS. AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL BIASES. IT'S VISIBLE IN WHICH FAMILIES HAVE INTER GENERATIONAL WEALTH AND WHICH ONES HAVE ONE TENTH OF THAT WEALTH ON AVERAGE TO WHITE PRIVILEGE. IT'S VISIBLE ON WHO CAN DRAW FREELY AND WHO GETS MURDERED WHILE ACT. EXERCISING ON THE WRONG STREET LIKE AHMAD ARBOR. IS VISIBLE IN WALL STREET WOULD FRAUD STURGE LIKE. VERY MADE OFF MICHAEL MILKEN IVAN BOESKY IN EVEN OCCUPIERS OF THE WHITE HOUSE FOR FINANCIAL CRIMES UNLIKE GEORGE FLOYD. WHO DIED FOR MAYBE PASSING A FAKE TWENTY DOLLAR BILL. EVERY YEAR BLACK CAUCUS DOES A RESOLUTION COMMEMORATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF JUNE TENTH THE ENDING OF SLAVERY. JUNE TENTH IS TOMORROW. WE DON'T DO THE RESOLUTION JUST BECAUSE- IT'S THE ANNIVERSARY REDO IT BECAUSE TOO FEW PEOPLE KNOW THE HISTORY OF JUNETEENTH. EVERY YEAR MEMBERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE SURE THEIR IGNORANCE OF JUNE TENTH TEEN BUT REALLY THEY'RE SURE THAT IT NEEDS OF THIS COUNTRY AND OUR HISTORY. TOO FEW PEOPLE MOSTLY ROOM TO WORK FOR YEARS AND IN MANY WAYS STILL AND DOOR NOW. EN AFTER THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION WE HAD. BY LAW SUCH AS PLESSY VERSUS FERGUSON JIM CROW. LEGALIZE LUNCHEON AND MANY OTHER ACTS OF DOMESTIC WHITE SUPREMACIST TERRORISM IN THIS COUNTRY AND I THINK STUDIES REQUIREMENT WILL HELP FIX THAT IGNORANCE FIFTY YEARS AGO THE CAL STATE SYSTEM BECAME THE BIRTHPLACE OF MODERN ETHNIC STUDIES BUT I WOULD CHALLENGE ANY CAL STATE GRADUATE ANY. US YOU YOU SEE GRADUATING YOU SEE LA OR U. S. C. OR STANFORD HARVARD YOUR BEST MINDS I WILL CHALLENGE YOU AGAINST A HIS DEBATE WITH ANYONE WANT TO H. B. C. USE THAT WOULD CLEAN YOUR CLOCK BECAUSE IT H. B. C. USE STATE CAME HISTORY. SANITIZED HISTORY. THE BILL CODIFIES THE NUMBER ONE RECOMMENDATION OF THE CHANCES OFFICE TASK FORCE REPORT WHICH IS TO INCLUDE ETHNIC STUDIES COURSES THE GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS. NOW I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE SOME WHO HAVE RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE LEGISLATURE DICTATING CAL STATE UNIVERSITY CURRICULUM BUT IS PRICE MANY OF THE SAME FOLKS ALL POLLS REMOVING OF RACES HEROES IN THIS COUNTRY AS WELL AND- CHANGING THE NAMES OF NAVAL AND ARMY BASES AS WELL. BUT CONTINUED IGNORANCE IS EVEN MORE COSTLY AND THIS REQUIREMENT IS JUSTIFIED IN OVERDUE THIS BILL HAS SUPPORT OF NOT ONLY A BLOCK CAUCUS DATING CAUCUS LATINO CAUCUS. AND IT'S ALSO SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA PROPERTY ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION AMONG MANY MANY MORE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SIR BRADFORD MOVING ON TO DEBATE. CENTER BARGES. THANK YOU A MISS PRESIDENT. I LIKE TO THINK THAT I A- RECEIVED A VERY WELL ROUNDED. LIBERAL ARTS UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION SETTING LITERATURE PHILOSOPHY NATURALLY I HAD A NUMBER OF COURSES THAT DEALT WITH ETHNIC COMPONENTS AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT HELPED ME QUITE A BIT IN BETTER APPRECIATING- MY ROLE IN THIS WORLD AND IN THOSE A PART OF IT. ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE RIGHT HERE IS THAT WE ARE CREATING- IN A POSITION. THAT PERHAPS ONE OF THE WORST TIMES THAT WE COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE FINANCIALLY. NOW BASED ON THE REPORT THAT I READ HERE IS THAT THIS WOULD. RUN ABOUT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO BE IMPLEMENTED. WE ARE REELING FROM. THE VIRUS PANDEMIC WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE FULL BREADTH AND COST OF HAVING TO CONVERT TO DISTANCE LEARNING. WE HAVE ADJUNCT FACULTY THROUGH OUR C. ISSUE SYSTEM THERE ARE LIKELY GOING TO BE PUT ON ICE IN WE ARE ON CLEAR THE RATE OF ATTRITION. AND THOSE STUDENTS WHO MAY NOT COME BACK GIVEN WHAT THE NEW BRICK AND MORTAR EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES LIKE. ALL THIS USE AN EXAMPLE ON MY HAPPENED AND I HAD THE HONOR OF REPRESENTING FRESNO STATE ONE OF THE C. ISSUES. THE SHORTFALL RIGHT NOW IS ALREADY THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND THAT WAS A WHILE BACK. YOU ADD THAT TO THE FACT THAT WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY STUDENTS WILL BE COMING BACK WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE SPORTS PROGRAM AND WHAT IMPACT THAT MIGHT HAVE ON FOUNDATION FUNDING IN OTHER RELATED TO- FUNDRAISING EFFORTS IN SHORT. WE ARE CREATING A SITUATION. THAT IS I THINK IT IT'S HARD BASED ON EDUCATION IN COULD BE GOOD FOR THE OVERALL ACADEMIC AND PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR STUDENTS BUT WE'RE CHOOSING THE ABSOLUTE WORST TIME TO CREATE. A IN A POSITION LIKE THIS IT'S ALMOST AS IF THIS WOULD BE BETTER SUITED IT THIS COULD COME BACK IT'LL AT A LATER DATE AND BE ON- DEBATED ON ON THE MERITS BUT IS AS OF RIGHT NOW COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR THOSE THAT REPRESENTS THE ISSUES OR THOSE THAT HAVE A LARGE CONSTITUENCY OF- ALUMNI ASK YOURSELF WHAT IS THIS GOING TO DO TO THE SCHOOL BASED ON COSTS BECAUSE- OUR- THE WAY THAT IT'S LIMITED RIGHT NOW IN ETHNIC STUDIES IT SHOULD LIKELY ALSO BE BROADENED TO A NUMBER OF OTHER. COMPONENTS WHETHER IT BE RELIGIOUS STUDIES WHETHER BE SOCIAL STUDIES OR VARIOUS OTHER INTERPOLATE YOUR CALL RELEVANT TOPICS. BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE FACULTY WHO ARE APPROPRIATELY SCHOOLED IN CREDENTIALS TO MAKE THEIR WAY INTO THE SYSTEM TO PROVIDE THIS REQUIRED COURSE. THAT EXTRAORDINARY COSTS IN IF YOU DON'T. THE SCHOOLS GOING TO HAVE TO INCORPORATE THAT JONES AT A RATE THEY CAN'T EVEN AFFORD NOW. SO FROM A PURELY FISCAL STANDPOINT. COLLEAGUES I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK ALLOW THIS MATTER TO BE BACK AYE IT HAS MERITS WE ENHANCE OUR ETHICS CITIES COMPONENT AS WELL AS OUR RELIGIOUS COMPONENT. THE RIGHT NOW SEE ISSUES ARE REELING. I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD ADD TO THE PROBLEM. THANK YOU SENATOR A GORGEOUS CENTER MONEY. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. I STAND IN SUPPORT OF AB FOURTEEN SIXTY I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM GARDENA FOR FRAMING THE ISSUE. SO WHILE pI WANT TO THANK DOCTOR WEBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER FOR HER LEADERSHIP. ON THIS ISSUE. SIMPLY UT MEMBERS ETHNIC STUDIES SHOULD BE FOR ALL STUDENTS AND FOR ALL OF SOCIETY. IF NOT NOW WHEN. THE TIME IS OVERDUE. THE TIME IS NOW I URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SIR MONNING SENATOR GROW NOT YET OKAY MOVE ON TO SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT SENATORS. I WANT FIRST OF ALL THANK MY GOOD FRIEND FROM LOS ANGELES AND ALSO THE SOME MEMBER ASSEMBLY WOMAN FROM. SAN DIEGO WHO AUTHORED THIS LEGISLATION FOR BRING THIS FORD AND CALLING FOR ETHNIC STAYS BE REQUIREMENTS FOR GRADUATION I CERTAINLY I FULLY AGREE HE- WITH THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL. I DO. SHARES I DO HAVE SOME FRUSTRATION- BECAUSE- CSU MORE THAN THREE YEARS AGO ACTUALLY CAME UP WITH THE RECOMMENDATION THAT THE SHOULD BE THE CASE AND THEN NEVER BROUGHT IT BEFORE THE FACULTY SENATE FOR- CONSIDERATION AND DEBATE. AND FACT WHEN THE BILL CAME BEFORE ARE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE. I ASKED THE CSU ABOUT THIS. NOW WHY IS THIS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE. THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST TIME A WHICH WE ARE. IMPOSING A GRADUATION REQUIREMENT ON THE ISSUE THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE WE CERTAINLY HAVE THE POWER TO DO SO. AND I THINK YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND. AND APPRECIATE WHAT THE ARE BOTH THE AUTHOR AND- THE FLOOR JOCKEY HAS SAID ABOUT. THE IMPORTANCE OF MOVING THIS FORWARD AND- CERTAINLY I AGREE THAT IT'S PAST DUE. AT C. S. YOU HAVE ACT ON THAT IN FACT A CHALLENGE TO SEE IF YOU TO SAVE WELL WHY DON'T YOU TAKE CARE OF THIS YOURSELF IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE LEGISLATURE MANDATING GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS. AND I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. IS PREFERABLE I SHOULD SAY THAT THE CSU. TAKE CARE OF ITSELF. AND IN FACT THEY ARE TAKING SOME STEPS TO DO SO HOWEVER I DO ALSO THINK THAT THIS IS A- FOR MANY REASONS AS ARTICULATED BY TO BY MY GOOD FRIENDS LOS ANGELES THAT THIS IS PAST DUE AND WE NEED TO BE SURE THIS HAPPENS AND NOT. I GET IT THE BILL WOULD IMPLEMENTED AS PAST OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR- BUT- WE DO NEED THIS. TO MOVE EXPEDITIOUSLY. SO I WILL BE VOTING FOR THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AT THIS BILL NOT DIE. ON THE SENATE FLOOR. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE CSU UNDERSTAND THAT THEY- HAVE THAT THEY HAD OPPORTUNITY ACT AND- THEY HAVE NOT DONE SO YET EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE NOW SUDDENLY WITH. GREAT A SELLER. TRYING TO GET THIS ISSUE. BUT I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT IN THE END. ODDS CSU- MOVE WITH ALL DUE SPEED. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BEFORE. THIS BILL EVEN REQUIRE IMPLEMENTATION AND ADDRESS THIS VERY IMPORTANT OUR- PROBLEM AND EFFICIENCY ACTUALLY IN THE EDUCATION. OF THE STUDENTS AT SEA ISSUES SO I DO URGE TO SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AT THIS BILL. CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AND AGAIN WOULD URGE CSU ITSELF TO. RAPIDLY ADDRESSES ISSUES ALL THESE SPEED. WE SHOULD NOT LET ANOTHER GRADUATING CLASS AS USE YOU. ARE GRADUATE OUT. HAVING BEEN EDUCATED. AND FULL HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER PAN CENTER ALSO. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB FOURTEEN SIXTY AND I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES GARDENA. AND THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM SAN DIEGO- FOR ALL THREE IN THIS THE BILL'S LANGUAGE READS THAT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS TO PROVIDE SEE IS DO THIS WITH THE TO ACQUIRE THE KNOWLEDGE AND THE SKILLS THAT WILL HELP THEM UNDERSTAND. THE DIVERSITY AND THE SOCIAL JUSTICE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOCIETY THAT THEY LIVE IN IN ORDER FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR SOCIETY AS RESPONSIBLE AND CONSTRUCTIVE CITIZENS. COLLEAGUES I'VE SPENT THE MAJORITY OF MY LIFE FIGHTING AGAINST INJUSTICES. THAT DETRIMENTALLY IMPACT CALIFORNIA'S UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THE FIRST TIME I LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT MEXICAN HISTORY MEXICAN AMERICAN HISTORY. BLACK HISTORY BEYOND KNOWING THE NAME OF THE GREAT MAN OF MARTIN LUTHER KING. BUT UNDERSTANDING. BETTER YET THE NONVIOLENT CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT FIRST TIME I LEARNED ANYTHING ABOUT THE API COMMUNITY IN THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF. LUPINO WORKERS IN THE FIELD OR THE INTERNMENT CAMPS. WITH WHEN AS A STUDENT WE FOUGHT FOR THESE STUDIES. AT SAINT MARY'S COLLEGE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE. WE DON'T GET THOSE CLASSES RIGHT AWAY SO WE FORMED A THIRD WORLD CENTER. SO THAT WE AS STUDENTS COULD SHARE WITH EACH OTHER WHAT WE KNEW WHEN WE STUDY TOGETHER TO UNDERSTAND OUR COMMUNITIES. THE STRUGGLE FOR EQUALITY AND JUSTICE FOR MANY COMMUNITIES CONTINUED TODAY. IT'S NOT JUST SOMETHING IN THE PAST THE BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT AGAINST THE BRUTAL AND I'M JUST KILLINGS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS AND POLICE BRUTALITY IN THE UNITED STATES. THE REASON GOOD NEWS CONCERNING MAJOR COURT DECISIONS UPHOLDING PROTECTIONS AND FREEDOMS FOR CALIFORNIA AND UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITIES IN OUR LGBT COMMUNITIES. AND YET THERE ARE CHILDREN BEING LOCKED UP IN CAGES BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN. OUR NATION DOES NOT KNOW NOR UNDERSTAND THE ROLE THAT RACE HAS PLAYED SINCE THE FORMATION OF OUR GREAT NATION. IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE AN OPEN AND INCLUSIVE WAY OF THINKING BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY IN OUR STATE IS BASED ON HUMAN DIVERSITY. THAT IS HOW WE DERIVE OUR STRENGTH. I THINK THE CURRENT MOVEMENTS WILL ULTIMATELY BE A KEY POINT IN OUR HISTORY. AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK TO ADDRESS THE SYSTEMIC RACIAL INJUSTICES THAT CONTINUE IN OUR SOCIETY. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ENSURE THAT FUTURE GENERATIONS CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THESE CRITICAL SKILLS BECOME TOLERANT COMPASSIONATE AND UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENT WALKS OF LIFE THAT PEOPLE COME FROM. AND WHAT TRAITS MAKE THEM WHO THEY ARE. IS THE AUTHOR SO ELOQUENTLY STATED IN HER STATEMENT. A STATE CURRICULUM THAT REQUIRES THAT MAKES THAT HE WILL HELP ALL OF OUR STUDENTS LEARN LESSONS FROM THE PAST TO BUILD A BETTER FUTURE. MEMBERS COLLEAGUES WE MUST TAKE ACTION TO WORK TOWARDS MAKING THAT BETTER FUTURE A REALITY NO MORE EXCUSES FIVE DECADES LATER THE TIME IS NOW. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO CENTER GLAZER. THANK YOU A. I'D LIKE HERE IN THIS MICROPHONE IS AT THE CARE OKAY IT'S KIND OF AN AWKWARD SPOT HERE. MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS OF. THE UP. TO THE NEED TO- TALK WITH YOU ABOUT THIS BILL. I WANT TO GIVE YOU A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE THAN HAS BEEN SHARED SO FAR ON THE FLOOR. CERTAINLY IF NOT A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ABOUT SUPPORT FOR ETHNIC STUDIES- WE AS THAT. I THE COMMUNITY AS A STATE IS A WORLD ARE BENEFITTED FROM THE RICH UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIVERSE CULTURES THAT OCCUPY. OUR SPACE. THAT PEOPLE THAT WE WORK WITH FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE WE BENEFIT FROM THAT WITHOUT QUESTION. I KNOW WE HAVE AN AUTHOR WHO HAS WORKED ON THIS ISSUE TIRELESSLY. FOR DECADES. CAME FROM MY UNIVERSITY SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY- AND I SERVED AT AYE AYE BY FOUR YEARS DOWN IN SAN DIEGO- A CATALOG. A RICH IN CHOICES IN ETHNIC STUDIES I TOOK A CLASS IN MEXICAN AMERICAN STUDIES IN COLLEGE. AT SAN DIEGO STATE IT TOOK A COURSE IN WOMEN'S STUDIES. AT SAN DIEGO STATE. THE CATALOG AND THEN AND NOW IS FILLED WITH. OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS TO LEARN ABOUT. THE BEAUTIFUL CULTURES AND HERITAGE IS. OF OUR STATE OUR NATION AND OUR AND OUR WORLD WE HAVE DEPARTMENTS. AND MAJORS IN ETHNIC STUDIES. SO IT'S NOT AS IF THEY AND THE CATALOG IS EMPTY. THE THAT WE SEE TODAY. IN FACT THE CAMPUSES OF LISTEN TO THIS. ISSUE AND THEY HAVE WHAT'S CALLED A DIVERSITY REQUIREMENT AT OUR UNIVERSITIES TODAY DIVERSITY REQUIREMENT WHAT IS IT IT MEANS THAT EACH OF THE CAMPUSES IN CONJUNCTION WITH THEIR FACULTY HAVE PUT A REQUIREMENT ON STUDENTS. TO TAKE A COURSE IN DIVERSITY. TO GRADUATE FROM THEIR UNIVERSITY TODAY. IN FACT THEY MENTION MY ALMA MATER SAN DIEGO STATE WHICH I'M PROUD OF. THEY DON'T REQUIRE ONE COURSE AT SAN DIEGO STATE THE REQUIRED TWO COURSES ONE IN ETHNIC STUDIES. AND WHAT A CULTURAL DIVERSITY OF COURSE THAT UNIVERSITY IS HEADED BY PRESIDENT TAYLOR TORI. IF YOU'RE FROM. CHIEF GO CSU CHICO HEADED BY PRESIDENT DEAL HUTCHINSON THEY REQUIRE TWO COURSES IN ETHNIC STUDIES TODAY. WHAT IN U. S. DIVERSITY AND WHAT AND GLOBAL CULTURES AT SAN JOSE STATE HEADED BY MERRY BUT PACEY AND- THEY HAVE A REQUIREMENT. RIGHT NOW TODAY IN ETHNIC STUDIES. IT'S TITLED SOCIETY INEQUALITY IN THE U. S. EVERYONE OF OUR TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES TODAY. HAS A DIVERSITY REQUIREMENTS. AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW YOURS FROM THE UNIVERSITY IN YOUR AREA PLEASE STOP BY MY DESK GOING TO BE HAPPY. TO SHARE WITH YOU. IT IS TRUE. THAT THIS IDEA OF AN ETHNIC STUDIES MANDATE. HAS BEEN. IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT THE CSU HAS LISTEN. THE ACADEMIC SENATE. IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR. APPROVED A REQUIREMENT FOR ETHNIC STUDIES. AND THAT RECOMMENDATION WAS FORWARDED TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THE TRUSTEES AND THROUGH THE COURSE OF THIS YEAR THEY HAVE ENGAGED IN CONSULTATION WITH THE STUDENTS WITH THE FACULTY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. ABOUT FORMALISING NOT THE DIVERSITY REQUIREMENT WHICH I'VE EXPLAINED TO YOU WITH THE CAMPUS IS. BETTER I AM A STATE MANDATE. FOR ETHNIC STUDIES AT THE UNIVERSITY AND THEY HAVE COMPLETED THAT CONSULTATION PROCESS. AND THAT PROPOSAL. IT'S COMING BEFORE THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES A FEW WEEKS FROM TODAY. LET ME MENTION WHAT THAT PROPOSAL SAYS. IT WOULD REQUIRE CSU UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS TO THE COMPLETE ONE LOWER DIVISION COURSES ETHNIC STUDIES AND SOCIAL JUSTICE. AS A PART OF THE CSU G. BREATH REQUIREMENTS. VERSUS SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE BASED ON A FOCUS ON THE INTERSECTION OF RACE AND ETHNICITY. AND DESCRIBE HOW RESISTED SOCIAL JUSTICE AND LIBERATION AS EXPERIENCED BY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND ARE RELEVANT TO CURRENT ISSUES. THEY SHOULD ALSO FOCUS ON HIERARCHY AND OPPRESSION. THAT'S THE RECOMMENDATION FOR THE FACULTY WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THE CURRICULUM AT OUR UNIVERSITIES. THAT'S NOW BEFORE THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES TO BE HEARD- IN A COUPLE WEEKS. NOW WHAT'S NOTEWORTHY ABOUT. THIS PROPOSAL BY THE UNIVERSITY BY THE FACULTY. IS THAT IT DOES HAVE A BROADER REQUIREMENT SIMPLY ETHNIC STUDIES FOR FOUR DIFFERENT CULTURES. IT MEANS THAT COURSES THAT ARE CURRENTLY OFFERED AT THE UNIVERSITY DEALING WITH. THIS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE DIVERSITY AND JUSTICE WOULD BE ELIGIBLE ECONOMIC THE POVERTY DISCRIMINATION IMMIGRATION WOULD BE ELIGIBLE. OR SIGN GENOCIDE WOULD NOW BE ELIGIBLE UNDER THE PROPOSAL THAT'S BEFORE THE TRUSTEES IN A FEW WEEKS ARMENIAN CULTURE. WOULDN'T BE ELIGIBLE UNDER THE PROPOSAL ON THE FLOOR TODAY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE UNDER THE PROPOSAL THAT'S BEFORE THE TRUSTEES DISABILITY STUDIES LGBT LITERATURE AND CULTURE WOULDN'T BE INCLUDED UNDER WHAT IS BEFORE US TODAY WOULD BE INCLUDED UNDER THE PROPOSAL BEFORE THE TRUSTEES ARAB AMERICAN IDENTITY MUSLIM FEMINISM. WOMEN IN LEADERSHIP SO THE PROPOSAL THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HEAR AND I'M VERY CONFIDENT THEY'RE GOING TO APPROVE. HAS A BROADER BREAST. TO INCORPORATE MANY OTHER ASPECTS OF A WORLD THAT ARE WORTHY OF STUDY. AND LEARNING. IT WAS SPOKEN EARLIER. MAYBE THE MOST TROUBLESOME ASPECT OF THE PROPOSAL FOR US. IS THAT IT TAKES WHAT IS TRADITIONALLY BEEN. THE PURVIEW OF THE FACULTY ARE UNIVERSITIES TO DETERMINE CURRICULA IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CAMPUS LEADERSHIP THAT THE TRUSTEES AND TAKE IT OUT OF THE ROMAN PUT IT IN THE POLITICAL REALM. NOW AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME FOR MANY MANY FROM MAYBE ON MY SIDE OF THE AISLE THIS IS A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE THINGS THAT WE KNOW ARE IMPORTANT AND ETHNIC STUDIES IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. BUT THINK ABOUT THE PRESIDENT THAT WOULD SET. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ANY FIVE YEARS AGO PROP ONE EIGHTY SEVEN WOULD HAVE BEEN ENACTED. WHO LIVE THOUGHT PROPOSITION TWO OR NINE WOULD HAVE BEEN ENACTED. TWENTY FIVE YEARS YOU THINK ABOUT HOW TIME CHANGES THINGS SO WE DON'T KNOW THE FUTURE TWENTY FIVE YEARS FROM NOW WHO'S GOING TO LEAVE OUR STATE. WHO'S GOING TO LEAD OUR SENATE. HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF THE GOVERNOR WAS NAME TRUNG. HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF THE UNITED STATES SENATE OF TODAY. REPRESENTING OUR STATE SENATE. TOMORROW. DO YOU WANT THAT LEADERSHIP. TELLING OUR ACADEMIC COMMUNITY OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE TAUGHT. SO THERE IS ENORMOUS PRECEDENT THAT'S BEEN SET BY THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU EVEN AS WORTHY. AN IMPORTANT AS THIS ONE. ONE OF MY- MOST ENJOYABLE PARTS OF BE A TRUSTEE. WAS TO GO TO THE GRADUATION CEREMONIES OF OUR UNIVERSITIES EVERY YEAR. THE CSU GRADUATES MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS IT'S UNBELIEVABLY GREAT. AND EVERY YEAR. I HEAR THE SAME FACTS ABOUT THAT STUDENT BODY. MORE THAN 60% FIRST IN THEIR FAMILY TO GRADUATE. TALK ABOUT FLOORING YOUR EMOTIONS WHEN YOU HEAR THAT THAT OPPORTUNITY THAT'S% BEEN GIVEN TO THEM THE CSU IS BEEN VIEWED AS THE PEOPLE'S UNIVERSITY AND IT IS. THAT'S SOMETHING THE SPACE. IS THERE ARE KIDS YOUR KIDS THERE LED BY THE MOST DIVERSE LEADERSHIP EDUCATION LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD. MORE PRESIDENT OF COLOR AND WOMEN MORE THAN A MAJORITY THE SAME WITH THE TRUSTEES WHICH WE AFFIRM ON THIS FLOOR THE LEADERSHP OF THE UNIVERSITY IS OUR LEADERSHIP. THERE ARE PEOPLE. AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO SHARE INPUT AND ADVICE FOR THEM TO DO THEIR BEST WORK. BUT THE PROPOSAL BEFORE US AS GOOD. HEARTED AT IS A IS IN A RIGHTEOUS CAUSE. AS I A FOR. IS NOT HOW WE SHOULD DO OUR BEST WORK. MY FRIENDS. AND I KNOW HOW UNCOMFORTABLE IT IS BECAUSE AS WAS STATED EARLIER A VOTE AGAINST THIS MEASURE IS NOT A VOTE THAT SAYS YOU A FIRM PREJUDICE AND- NOT A CHANCE IN FACT YOU TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES OF THE DAY. AND YOU TALK ABOUT THE WORK TO. READ OUR PUBLIC PLACES. OF THOSE WHO HAVE PRACTICED DISCRIMINATION. AN INCREDIBLE WAYS. I HAVE BEEN A LEADER THAT AFTER FIVE YEARS AGO ON THIS FLOOR WE PASSED LEGISLATION WITH YOUR SUPPORT. IT WOULD TAKE THE NAMES OF CONFEDERATE LEADERS OFF OUR PUBLIC SPACES. SO WE HAVE AS A SENATEEXERCISE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS IN PLACES WHERE WE SEE DISCRIMINATION AND PREJUDICE. WHEN WE SPEAK HERE ON THE FLOOR OUR VOICE OUR VOICE MATTERS. AND WE NEED TO MAKE GOOD CHOICES ABOUT WHEN WE SPEAK UP RIGHTEOUSLY OF INJUSTICE. BETTER VOICE THESE THE MATTER. AND WE NEED TO PICK THE PLACES IN WHICH THAT VOICE NEEDS TO BE SPOKEN WITH CLARITY AND FORCEFULNESS. AS OUR VOICE MATTERS. AND SO I ASK YOU TODAY IS THIS REALLY THAT SPACE. A DIVERSE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM WITH GREAT LEADERSHIP. RESPONSIVE TO THIS DAY OF WHAT THIS IS THE GOALS OF THIS MEASURE OUR. DIVERSITY OF CULTURE UNDERSTANDING TOLERANCE. OF COURSE IT IS. OF COURSE IT IS. SO I WOULD SAY TO YOU MY FRIENDS. WITH GREAT SUPPORT AND APPRECIATION FOR THIS AUTHOR FOR THIS. IMPORTANT COSTS OF CREATING UNDERSTANDING AND DIVERSITY. AND TOLERANCE OF ALL PEOPLE OF OUR WORLD. THIS IS A PLACE TO TAKE IT TO SIT OUT. LET THE TRUSTEES TO THEIR WORK IN A MATTER OF WEEKS LETTER CAMPUS COMMUNITY DO THEIR BEST WORK IN A COUPLE WEEKS I THINK IT WILL MAKE ALL OF US PROUD. AND IT WILL NOT SET THE PRECEDENT THAT NONE OF US WOULD SEE. IN SENATE ON THE SENATE FLOOR. OF INTERFERENCE. IN THE- THERE IS A RE. THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS IN THE CONSTITUTION. IT MAKES AS FRUSTRATED WE WANT THEM TO DO CERTAIN THINGS BUT OUR OUR OUR FOR THE FOLKS THAT. HAVE BEEN AROUND THIS EARTH FOR A LONG TIME NEW. WHERE THE POLITICS SHOULD BE AND ONE OF THOSE PLACES IT IN THE ACADEMY WE HAVE PLENTY OF CHECKS AND BALANCES IN OUR SYSTEM. AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO SIT OUT THIS VOTE. THE YOU SIR GLAZER SENT ARE STILL. THANK YOU FOR PRESIDENT I'D LIKE TO THANK CENTER BRAD REPRESENTING THIS. BILL TO US IT IS SO IMPORTANT WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS THE KEY TO THE FUTURE OUR HISTORY AS WE NOW SEE IT. IS TAINTED THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT'S WHY THE STATUES ARE COMING DOWN ALL OVER AMERICA BECAUSE OUR HISTORY IS TAINTED AND IF WE DON'T LOOK AT OUR HISTORY WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WITH OUR FUTURE. AND OUR KIDS I'VE GOT FIVE CHILDREN AND I STILL COLUMN CHILDREN OF ALL GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE THEY HAVE FRIENDS AND WIVES IN HUSBANDS THAT ARE. MIX FROM ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES- AND I THINK HOW IMPORTANT AT THAT STUDIES IS RIGHT NOW WE HEAR ABOUT TIMING. MISTER BRADFORD THANK YOU BECAUSE TIME IS SO VERY IMPORTANT. WE CANNOT. LET THE SENATE. TAKE A STEP BACK WE'VE GOT TO GO FORWARD AS A UNIT TO UNDERSTAND THAT IS NOT ABOUT MONEY IT'S ABOUT SENSITIVITY IT'S ABOUT THE LEADERSHIP AND OF OUR FUTURE THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE IN COLLEGE TODAY WHO ARE ABOUT TO TAKE THE HELM OVER THE NEXT TEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY YEARS THEY'VE GOT TO SEE AND THEY'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND. TO BE THE SENSITIVITY BUT THEY MUST HAVE IT LAW ENFORCEMENT WE SEE THAT RIGHT NOW IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE SENSITIVITY AND THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE COMMUNITY TO BE THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMMUNITY AND WHEN WE TAKE AWAY THAT KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL FOR MORE COLLEGES AND HERE'S THE THING IN ISN'T IT TRUE THAT OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT LEADERS WILL BE COLLEGE GRADUATES MORE IMPORTANTLY PROBABLY FROM THERE- NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE CAL STATE SYSTEM. PROBABLY FROM EAST LA PROBABLY FROM SOUTH CENTRAL GUARDINO WHEREVER THEY MIGHT BE THEY'RE GOING TO BE OUR LEADERS OF THE FUTURE FROM THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND THEY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND SENSITIVITY ACROSS THE BOARD SO ETHNIC STUDIES IS NOT JUST- SOMETHING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO THROW BECAUSE OF THE COST OR NO COST WHATEVER IT'S A NECESSITY IN TODAY'S WORLD. IN TODAY'S WORLD WHAT IS HAPPENING WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT EVERY CHILD UNDERSTANDS THE WORK SPACE DIGNITY HONOR IN THAT HONOR THROW THAT OUT TO YOU AS OUR MEN WERE WERE SERVING IN THE- THERE ARE SO MANY MINORITY IN THE MILITARY TO MEET. FOR WHAT THEY DO IS THERE A FRONT FIND. AND SENSITIVE. WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR HE- DOWN THE- FOR PROMOTIONS IT ALL WITH YOU THIS AND I'VE THIS SENATOR. SO THAT IN THE END STATES MAY. A THE- WE HAVE. I'M SO WE HAVE FOR TWO FOUR STAR GENERALS. FORTY TWO FOUR STAR GENERALS. AND WE ONLY HAD ONE AFRICAN AMERICAN FOR YEARS NOW WE JUST HAVE THE SECOND. CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT FORTY TWO FOUR STAR GENERALS AND NOW. LOOK AT ALL THE YEARS OF CON BY NOW WE HAVE FINALLY HAVE TO. WELL WHAT ABOUT THE LATINOS WHAT ABOUT ASIANS WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE OF ALL MIXTURES. IT IS TIME THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE STEP FORWARD WE HAVE TO DO IT AS A UNIT. AND BE AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT THIS ALL MEANS SO I URGE AN AYE VOTE AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME MISTER PRESIDENT. IT IS ARE JULY SENT BELL. MEMBERS ARE I REPRESENT ONE OF THE LARGEST. UNIVERSITIES SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY. AND LAST YEAR I WENT TO THE CELEBRATION OF OUR FIFTIETH. ANNIVERSARY OF OUR BLACK STUDIES PROGRAM AND I READ INTO ONE OF MY PROFESSORS DR. STEPHEN MILNER WHO IS CHAIRMAN OF THE DEPARTMENT. AND HE JOKED ABOUT HOW IT WAS A FAIR TO MIDDLING STUDENT YOU KNOW BUT- HE SHARED WITH ME. LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE HISTORY OVER THE YEARS. OF THEM NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS. TO A ACTUALLY ELIMINATE THE DEPARTMENT. TO REDUCE THE SCOPE OR THE DEPARTMENT REDUCE THE FACULTY. AND I KNOW ALSO THERE ARE THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO THE MAX AMERICAN STUDIES DEPARTMENT IS SENT TO THE STATE OVER THE YEARS BECAUSE IT WAS NOT CONSIDERED A CORD APARTMENT. THERE WERE NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS EVERY TIME THERE WAS A BUDGET PROBLEM. LIKE WE HAVE NOW. TO ELIMINATE OR REMOVE THE DEPARTMENT AND WE HAVE WE HAVE A VERY PROUD HERITAGES OUT OF THE STATE. WITH DOCTOR GALARZA. CREATING THE DEPARTMENT AT SAN JOSE STATE. AND I'M ROSE. THE EMPHASIS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF SOCIAL WORKERS- THOUSANDS OF SOCIAL WORKERS AND GRADUATED THERE. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF TEACHERS. PSYCHOLOGY. EVEN URBAN STUDIES POLITICAL SCIENCE LIKE MYSELF. GRADUATE DEGREES. IN THE HUMANITIES AND ARTS. BECAUSE THIS IS PARTIALLY ABOUT THAT ALSO WAS ABOUT NOT JUST HISTORY IT'S ABOUT. YOU'RE LEARNING ABOUT. HUMANITIES AND ARTS. AND WE HAVE A PROBLEM DEPARTMENT- THAT TEACHES THAT THAT'S WITH THOSE DEPARTMENTS TEACH. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THESE DEPARTMENTS IN THIS DAY AND AGE OR ESSENTIAL THERE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED. LIKE THE MOST RECENT TIME THEY CALL THEY TALKED ABOUT SCALING BACK THE DEPARTMENT. IT ACTUALLY WASN'T THAT LIKE TWENTY YEARS AGO IT WAS ONLY LIKE FIVE YEARS AGO. THEY TRIED TO ELIMINATE THE DEPARTMENT FIVE YEARS AGO. AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. THAT'S A PATTERN EVERY TIME EVERY TIME THERE'S A BUDGET PROBLEM THEY ALWAYS LOOK AT THE PARCHMENTS THAT OR NOT THE COURT APARTMENTS. THE REPEAT THE MANDATED DEPARTMENTS FOR YOUR BASIC EDUCATION AND THEY PROPOSED TO ELIMINATE OF. AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT I THINK THE DEPARTMENT. SHOULD HAVE THE STATUS. OF A DEPARTMENT THAT'S ESSENTIAL TO THE UNIVERSITIES BEING. WHICH IS THE WAY ACTUALLY THE STUDENTS LOOK AT THE DEPARTMENT. YOU TALK TO THE STUDENTS THEY THANK FIFTIES DEPARTMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL WHEN THEY WALK BY. SO THE STATE THE TWENTY FIVE FOOT HIGH STATUE OF. TOMMY SMITH AND JOHN CARLOS. THERE WE HAVE IT SET OUT OF THE STATE. AND REMEMBER THE HERITAGE. OF OUR UNIVERSITY THEY HAPPEN TO BE ONE I WENT TO SCHOOL THERE WHEN THESE DEPARTMENTS WERE PARADED. AND THE STRUGGLE SURGE PARADE ON. GIVEN THE FACT THAT. THE PROTESTS RESULTED IN. THE REACTION OF POLITICIANS TO ELIMINATE THOSE DEPARTMENTS AT THAT TIME. SO IT SEEMS TO ME IT SEEMS TO ME. THAT WE HAVE TO REALLY LOOK AT WHAT REALLY IS GOING ON HERE. IF WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE THIS A CORE. OF OUR UNIVERSITY AND A CORE OF OUR EDUCATION OF THE TEACHERS AND SOCIAL WORKERS THE BUSINESS PEOPLE THE PEOPLE THAT WORK HERE IN THIS BUILDING OF THE PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THE HEALTH CARE WORKERS. TO HAVE A CULTURAL HAPPENS EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT THE CULTURAL COMPETENCY SHOULD BE A- BASIC NORM. IN OUR SOCIETY. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE OUGHT TO HAVE THE STUDENTS TO GET DEGREES IN. POLICE IN ALL CRIMINAL JUSTICE IT WOULD BE CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROGRAM THERE. WE SHOULD HAVE CULTURAL COMPETENCY IN OUR STUDENTS. AND THAT'S WHY. I AGREE WITH THE- CENTER FROMGARDENIA I THINK WE HAVE A PASS THAT'S NOT GOOD. WE SHOULD CORRECT THAT PASS IN ADJUSTED THIS IS WHY SUPPORT THIS BILL. VIRGIN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SIR BILL CENTER MITCHELL. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT OF A QUESTION OF THE A FLOOR MANAGER PLEASE. DEBORAH FOR YOU CHECK A QUESTION. I HAVE TO THANK YOU- WOULD COULD CLEAR FIVE ME IF THIS REQUIREMENT WOULD BE IN ADDITION TO THE DIVERSITY REQUIREMENT WE HEARD OUR COLLEAGUE TALK ABOUT OR WOULD IT REPLACE IT. IN BEEN DISHING TO IN ADDITION TO OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH I ON MY OWN TIME IF I MAY MISTER PRESIDENT COURSE- THIS IS BEEN AT. THE LIGHTNING AND AN INFORMATIVE AND HELPFUL DEBATE FOR ME I THINK THEY'RE JUST A COUPLE THINGS I DON'T WANT TO BE REDUNDANT TERMS OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID YOU KNOW ONE THING THAT STRUCK ME AS I SAT HERE AND LISTENED AYE I THOUGHT BACK TO MY OWN EXPERIENCE IN ETHNIC STUDIES IN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE. AND WHAT I'D ALWAYS STRUCK ME IT WAS ALWAYS STUDENTS OF COLOR WHO DID THE CLASSES. THE MAJORITY STUDENTS THEY JUST WEREN'T THERE THAT MAY BE MY- INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE. AND AS WE LOOK AT THE CHALLENGES AND EXPERIENCES WERE HAVING TODAY PRIMARILY WITH. CONVINCING OTHERS ABOUT THE LIFE EXPERIENCE OF PEOPLE OF COLOR THAT'S HALF THE CHALLENGE AND WE HAVE SO MANY DEBATES ON THE FLOOR SO MANY TIMES THAT NOW IS THE NOT THE RIGHT TIME LET'S COLLECT DATA WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. AND THIS IS OUR EFFORT TO POUR INTO THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA INFORMATION SO WE CAN GET BEYOND. ON THE NEED TO RE EDUCATE THE MAJORITY. TEMPORARILY ARM ABOUT THE EXPERIENCES OF PEOPLE OF COVER EVERY TIME THAT THERE'S A CHALLENGE IT IS A CONVERSATION WE HAVE TO START FROM THE BEGINNING. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FUTURE LEADERS OF OUR GREAT STATE- ARE BETTER THAN WE ARE. THAT'S MY HOPE. MY HOPE IS THAT THESE GRADUATING STUDENTS WILL COME ON AND BE THE FUTURE LEADERS THE FUTURE CORPORATE LEADERS BUSINESS LEADERS AND SO WE CAN STEP AWAY FROM HAVING TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND VALIDATING WIDE DIVERSITY HELPS YOUR BUSINESS WHY DIVERSE CAMPUS. IS HEALTHY FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF LEADERS. THE CATALOG OF OFFERINGS IS NOT THE ISSUE. ALTHOUGH I WAS INTRIGUED TO SEE CHICO STATE IN THEIR DIVERSITY- REQUIREMENTS AT A COURSE ENTITLED. HEALTH AT EVERY SIZE A NON DIET APPROACH TO WELLNESS. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT DIVERSITY VERSES ETHNIC STUDIES THERE'S A DIFFERENCE THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE AND WHAT WE ARGUING IS THE IMPORTANCE OF A SPECIFIC CONVERSATION AROUND RACE THAT'S WHAT ETHNIC STUDIES BRINGS TO THE TABLE. BECAUSE I. APPRECIATE BUT I PROBABLY COULD HAVE BENEFITTED FROM THE HEALTH EVERY SIZE AND ON THAT APPROACH TO WELLNESS AND PERHAPS SHOULD HAVE TAKEN IT- AND THEIR PEOPLE I'M SURE WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THAT BUT LET'S NOT CONFUSE THE IMPORTANT VALUE OF CONVERSATIONS AROUND DIVERSITY WITH A CORE CURRICULUM ABOUT ETHNIC STUDIES THERE IS A DIFFERENCE. AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT THERE IS SPACE IN OUR UNIVERSITY SYSTEM BY BOTH. I APPRECIATE THAT ARE CSU SYSTEM MAY BE ONE OF THE DIVERSE MOST DIVERSE IN THE WORLD BUT LET'S BE CLEAR COMPARED TO WHAT HIGHER ACADEMIA IS ONE OF THE LEAST THE FIRST. SECTORS IN THE WORLD. AND SO IT MAY BE ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE BUT IS IT TRULY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE MOST DIVERSE STATE. THE OTHER CHALLENGE IS PIPELINE ISSUES YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS AN UNDERGRAD ALBEIT A MILLION YEARS AGO. MOST OF THE TENURED PROFESSORS THAT WE LOOK TO AS EXAMPLES THAT WE COULD GO TO FOR GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT. WERE IN THE ETHNIC STUDIES DEPARTMENTS. MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN JOSE IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. THE MINUTE THAT THERE IS ANY KIND OF FINANCIAL UP A CHALLENGE TO UNIVERSITY THOSE DEPARTMENTS ARE DOWNGRADED TO PROGRAMS THEY DON'T BACK FEEL VACANCIES BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A TENURE TRACK FOR PROFESSORS AND SO WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE IT. A DIVERSE INSTITUTION AND BE ABLE TO HIRE FROM WITHIN THERE IN LIES THE PROBLEM. I'M NOT SURE HOW ANY OF US CAN GUARANTEE OR BE CONFIDENT ABOUT WHAT ANOTHER APPOINTED BODY WILL DO. FIND OUT. WHAT I DO KNOW IS WHAT'S WHAT A SIGNAL THIS WILL SEND. TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE SAYS THIS IS SO IMPORTANT FOR ALL THE REASONS STATED BY MY COLLEAGUES THAT WE ARE WILLING TO SET THE PRECEDENT BY MAKING IT A MANDATE I AM CLEAR WHAT KIND OF SIGNAL THAT WILL SEND TO THE TRUSTEES IN THEIR DELIBERATIONS THEY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS FOR YEARS. AND HAVE FAILED. ANSEL VOTE TODAY WILL ALLOW THE BILL TO STAY ALIVE AND HOPEFULLY- SEND A STRONG SIGNAL ABOUT OUR EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THE CORE VALUE. OF THIS KIND OF EDUCATION I'LL BE SUPPORTING MAYBE FOURTEEN SIXTY TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL CENTER GONZALEZ. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES BY STOP THE STAND AS WELL AND VERY STRONG SUPPORT OF AB FOURTEEN SIXTY AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER AS WELL AS SENATOR BRADFORD FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IT CERTAINLY LONG OVERDUE THE TIME IS NOW YOU'VE HEARD THIS MANY TIMES- BUT THIS IS REALLY. A BILL THAT WILL NOT ONLY PREPARES FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF LEADERS THIS IS A BILL PRODUCED AND WANTED AND NEEDED BY OUR STUDENTS MOST OF WHICH TERMINATE MINORITY STUDENTS. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION STUDENTS WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY. WITH DEEP STRUCTURE STRUGGLE AND PERSEVERANCE AND THEY DID BETTER WHEN THEY DID. STUDENTS WHO IDENTIFIED LITTLE WITH THEIR OWN ETHNIC GROUP ACHIEVED POORLY. OVERWHELMING DOMINANCE OF EURO AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES. THE MANY STUDENTS TO DISENGAGE FROM CREATIVE ARE I'M SORRY FROM ACADEMIC LEARNING. IT'S NOT JUST AN ACADEMIC VALUE IT'S A SOCIAL VALUE INVALUABLE. AND JUST AS WE SOUGHT TO IMPORTANT- SUPREME COURT DECISIONS LGBT Q. AMERICANS WERE PROTECTED IN THE WORKPLACE AND DHAKA'S. DREAMERS WERE PROTECTED WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO SEE THOSE DECISIONS IN OUR HISTORY BOOKS. OVERALL THIS PROVIDES A SPACE MINORITY STUDENTS FEEL THEIR HERITAGE HOUSE WORTH. YES WE KNOW THE IMMIGRATION AND STRUGGLES WITH IMMIGRATION AND STRUGGLES WITHIN JUST AS SLAVERY ARE PART OF THAT HISTORY THEY ALSO NEED TO KNOW THAT THE SUCCESSES OF OUR LEADERS ARE PART OF THAT HISTORY TO. IN ADDITION THE INTERSECTION ALLEY OF WOMEN OF COLOR WHO ARE OFTEN NOT IN THESE BOOKS AND OVERLOOKED. IN PAID LESS AND NOT EVEN VISIBLE IN THESE BOOKS SHOULD ALSO BE INCLUDED. SO WITH THAT I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU AGAIN I ASK YOU COLLEAGUES TO MAKE THIS A VERY IMPORTANT PRIORITY FOR US WE DON'T MAKE THIS DECISION NOW IT'S THAT SENDS A CLEAR MESSAGE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR GONZALEZ CENTER LEYVA. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT GOOD MORNING MEMBERS- I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL WHEN I FIRST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR- DOCTOR WEBER HAS BEEN TENACIOUS ON THIS ISSUE AND I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF HEARING BILL SIMILAR TO THIS SINCE I'VE BEEN ON THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS. MEMBERS WE CAN ALWAYS FIND A WAY NOT TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S THE EASIEST THING TO DO IS TO SAY NO AND WE CAN MAKE EXCUSE AFTER EXCUSE AFTER EXCUSE. WHAT'S HARD TO DO. IS FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE DO THE RIGHT THING. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DO THE RIGHT THING. IT IS LONG OVERDUE. WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE COST IN THAT THE IN THE UNIVERSITIES CAN'T WIN KERR THE COSTS NOW. WELL I THINK WE CAN ALWAYS BLAME COSTS EVEN THOUGH WE ARE IN A GOING INTO A RECESSION NOW BUT I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE COST OF DOING NOTHING. IS MORE EXPENSIVETHAN THE COST OF IMPLEMENTING THIS. WE ALL LEARN WHAT WE LIVE AT HOME AND GUESS WHAT. SOMETIMES RACISM IS TOP RIGHT THERE IN SOMEONE'S LIVING ROOM. SO IF WE DON'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE HOPE FOR THE FUTURE. TO LEARN ABOUT OTHER ETHNICITIES HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS WORLD. I DON'T KNOW I DON'T SEE THAT WHEN WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER WERE MOR ACCEPTING OF EACH OTHER WHEN WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER WE REALIZE WE HAVE MORE IN COMMON. THAN NOT. AND I HAVE TO ALSO SAY THAT DIVERSITY IN ETHNIC STUDIES FOR TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. AND I HAVE TO. STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM A RENDA. ANIM SOMEWHAT OFFENDED WHEN HE APPLIED THE PEOPLE ON HIS SIDE OF THE AISLE. WHICH I'M NOT SURE WHAT WAS ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE AISLE. THAT WE ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A SITUATION TO VOTE ON THIS. YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE SUPPORTED ETHNIC STUDIES SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE WE HAVE WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW RIGHTLY SO IN THE STREETS. I'D ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT YES THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS IN JANUARY. CAME OUT WITH THIS IDEA THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO IN ETHNIC STUDIES BUT WHAT. PEOPLE FAIL TO MENTION IS THAT THREE YEARS AGO THE C. ISSUES DID A STUDY THEIR OWN STUDY AND CONCLUDED THAT THEY NEEDED TO ADD ETHNIC STUDIES. TO THEIR CURRICULUM THEY DIDN'T DO IT I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE ONLY REASON THEY'RE DOING IT NOW OR SAY THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT. IS BECAUSE OF DOC RIVERS BILL BECAUSE OF THIS BILL SO WE CAN'T LET THEM OFF THE HOOK. I LOVE OR RC ISSUES AND I THINK THEY DO FABULOUS WORK. BUT SOMETIMES THEY HAVE TO BE PUSHED A LITTLE BIT. I THINK WE CAN WORRY ABOUT PRESIDENT. BUT SOMETIMES. IF WE JUST HIDE BEHIND THAT. WE DON'T GET THE RIGHT THING DONE. SO MANY IN WAS SOMETHING. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE VISUAL LEARNERS I WOULD ASK YOU TO WATCH A MOVIE AND YOU MIGHT SAY CONNIE LEIVA THAT SEEMS VERY AN ACADEMIC ASKING US O WATCH A MOVIE I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO WATCH REMEMBER THE TITANS. AND THE REASON I ASK YOU TO WATCH THAT MOVIE IS BECAUSE IT'S BASED ON A TRUE STORY AND WHEN YOU LOOK T HOW DIVIDED THAT FOOTBALL TEAM WAS WHITES AND BLACKS AND WHEN DENZEL WASHINGTON COULD THEIR COACH SAYS I'M GONNA MAKE EACH OF YOU SPEND TIME TOGETHER AND LEARN ABOUT EACH OTHER WHAT HAPPENED THEY ENDED UP WITH A PERFECT SEASON. I WOULD ALSO ARGUE THAT IT'S OUR YOUNG PEOPLE THEY'RE GOING TO CHANGE THIS WORLD WHEN YOU ALSO WATCH THAT MOVIE YOU WILL SEE THAT IT IS THE ADULTS IT IS THE PEOPLE THAT ARE OUR AGE ON THIS FLOOR WHO ARE THE PROBLEM LET'S NOT BE THE PROBLEM LET'S BE THE SOLUTION WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY LET'S TAKE IT I STRONGLY SUPPORT. AB FOURTEEN SIXTY. THANK YOU SIR LABOR CENTER MORLOCK. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I'M IN REVIEWING THE FLOOR ANALYSES FOR THIS BILL WHILE WE WERE DEBATING AND I'M I'M NOT FINDING SOMETHING SO MAY I. ASK A QUESTION OF THE FLOOR MANAGER. MISTER BRADFORD WE TAKE A QUESTION NOW. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. THIS BILL THROUGH THE CHAIR CENTER MORE LIKE YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. THIS BILL IS SPECIFIC TO SEE A- AND- MY NOW WE ALSO SEE THAT IT MY BE A TO THE CAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ARE SO WE HAVE STUDENTS BUT IT IS NOT APPLICABLE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SO I'M- AREAS HAVE THEY'RE READY IMPLEMENTED THIS POLICY. I'M NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF NO WE STARTED AT CAL STATE UNIVERSITY- THAT WAS THOUGHT TO WORKERS DESERVE RESEARCH ON THE YEAH. WE DO HAVE I'VE BEEN STILL WE HAVE HIGH. OKAY YOU SEE I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY AND SO WE HAVE NO WITH TO DEMAND A RE. CURRICULUM FROM THE- UNIVERSITY THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. I'M A SORT OF A NO BETTER NO WORSE I. WOULD CERTAINLY A WE WERE TO IT FOR SYSTEM MAKE DO IT FOR THE-OTHERS FOR I PRE THE CALL I'M ONE OF THOSE. THAT BELIEVES THAT MANAGER SHOULD MANAGE SO I ARE ARE ARE VERY APPRECIATE. THE FLOOR SPEECH PROVIDED BY THE SENATOR FOR MARANDA HIGH. I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE HIS COMMENTS TO HEART THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. THANK YOU SIR MORE LIKE CENTER HUESO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AWAY AND JUST SO VERY BRIEFLY. YOU KNOW I DON'T SEE ANY PROBLEM. WITH THE LEGISLATURE WEIGHING IN ON ON THE ISSUE OF EDUCATION IN OUR STATE. IN ANY REGARD NOW WHATEVER THE OVER THE DEBATE IS THAT SO I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THAT BUT MOSTLY. MY MAIN CONCERN OF OUR UNIVERSITIES AND I'VE OFTEN ASKED THIS. OF THE LEADERS OF OUR UNIVERSITIES AND ASKED THEM WHAT S YOUR MISSION. DO YOU HAVE A MISSION WHAT IS YOUR PRIMARY MISSION IF YOU WERE TO DESCRIBE WHAT YOU ARE THERE TO DO AND THE UNIVERSITY. WHAT IS IT. OFTEN I GET DIFFERENT RESULTS RESPONSES AND THAT OFTEN CONCERNS ME. BECAUSE WHEN INDIVIDUALS RUNNING OUR UNIVERSITIES DON'T AGREE ON WHAT THEIR MISSION IS. THERE ARE GENERALLY GOING TO GET DIFFERENT OUTCOMES AND I'VE HEARD THINGS FROM TO- MAKE BETTER PEOPLE OF OUR STUDENTS TO. PROVIDE THEM WITH A BETTER FUTURE. A GENERAL ANSWERS. AND I ALWAYS RESPOND. WITH WITH A QUESTION OF SHOULDN'T WE HAVE VERY CLEAR GOALS SET OUT OF OUR UNIVERSITY SO WE KNOW WHAT THE GOAL IS SO THAT WE CAN MEASURE WHETHER WE'RE ACCOMPLISHING OUR GOAL. AND I ALWAYS ASK HIM ISN'T OUR GOAL TO CREATE OF OUR STUDENTS. CRITICAL THINKERS AND WHAT IS A CRITICAL THINKER SOMEBODY THAT CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD. SOMEBODY THAT KNOWS WHAT IT IS AND HOW TO EMPLOY IT. BECAUSE OF THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD THAT'S HOW WE HAVE. OF PUT UP. OF PEOPLE ON THE MOON. INTO SPACE HOW WE HAVE BUILT SKYSCRAPERS AND- A MAKE UP AN AIRPLANE FLY. AND IF WE ARE PREPARING CALIFORNIANS TO BE CRITICAL THINKERS. THEY WILL BE ABLE TO ANSWER EVERY QUESTION ON THEIR OWN. AND SO I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WORK OUR UNIVERSITIES ARE DOING AND I HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT OUR OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH IT. AND I APPRECIATE OF. THE OTHERS CENTER LIVE I'M SORRY MENTION YOUR MAN NAMED BUT YOU BEAT ME TO THE PUNCH ON RECOMMENDED MOVIE. BUT I ALSO WANT TO RECOMMEND A MOVIE. AND IT'S A MOVIE THAT I SAW THAT REALLY CHANGED MY VIEW ON. THE AYE AYE THAT THAT PEOPLE ARE MUTABLE PEOPLE ARE CHANGEABLE PEOPLE CAN BE INFLUENCE WITH AN EDUCATION. FULL OF HAVE HUMAN QUALITIES THAT CAN BE INFLUENCE TO CHANGE THEIR VIEWS ABOUT. HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE THIS MOVIE IS CALLED THE BEST OF ENEMIES. AND IT TALKS ABOUT A CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER AND- ATWATER. AND THE LEADER OF THE GRAND MASTER OF THE KLU KLUX KLAN. A CP ELLIS. WHO WERE BROUGHT TOGETHER AS PART OF A. PUBLISHED A SURE- A CHARRETTE COMMUNITY CHARETTE. TWO DISK THE INTEGRATION SCHOOLS IN THEIR COMMUNITY. AND HOW CP ELLIS BEING THE DIRECTOR CLICK CLICK FIND WOULD NEVER ACCEPT INTEGRATION. UNTIL HE WAS PUT THROUGH A PROCESS TO UNDERSTAND. THE OTHER THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COMMUNITY AND TO VISIT AND TO SEE THAT THERE WERE PEOPLE THEY HAD FEELINGS AND THEY DESERVE AN EDUCATION I KNEW HE WAS THE DECIDING VOTE. TO INTEGRATE THE SCHOOLS. AND IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND IT'S JUST A FASCINATING MOVIE THE SHOWS THAT. EDUCATION IS CRITICAL TO CHANGING. THE PATH OF OUR COUNTRY. AND IF IT'S SO IMPORTANT WHY ARE WE PUTTING MORE AND OF AN EMPHASIS OF BIG GIVING PEOPLE. AN EDUCATION THE QUESTIONS THEM IN THEIR COMFORT ZONE. MAKE PEOPLE UNCOMFORTABLE MAKE THEM LEARN. IF THEY ARE GOING TO THE UNIVERSITY'S CHALLENGE THEIR MINDS AND CHALLENGE THEIR THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD TO WEAR THAT COULD AFFECT THEIR CORE BELIEFS. THIS IS A VERY POWERFUL BILL. THIS THIS GETS TO JUST SIMPLY PROVIDING OUR STUDENTS WITH AN EDUCATION NOT INDOCTRINATING THEM MAKING THEM CRITICAL THINKERS MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND BUT WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE INFORMATION IN FRONT OF YOU. TEN AND LEARN HOW TO DISSECT IT ON YOUR OWN WE ARE MAKING SCIENTISTS OF OUR STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA THERE THE FUTURE OF OUR ECONOMY TO THE FUTURE OF OUR WORLD. IF WE PROVIDE THEM WITH THE RIGHT EDUCATION THE WORLD WILL BE A BETTER PLACE. AND THEY WILL BE MORE EMPLOYABLE. AND THEY'LL BE ABLE TO UNITE OUR COUNTRY. TWO I MEAN I'VE VISITED OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE UNITED ON RACIAL ISSUES AND THEY ARE POWERFUL COUNTRIES ECONOMICALLY. WE ARE SUFFERING FROM MARCH A CANCER THAT IS HURTING OUR VERY ECONOMIC SYSTEM LADIES AND GENTLEMAN LET'S CHALLENGE THAT LET'S ASK OUR UNIVERSITIES. TO CHALLENGE THEIR STUDENTS AND BRING UP. A IT'S A SUBJECT THAT SENSITIVE YES IT'S CONTROVERSIAL SENSITIVE IT'S GONNA MAKE PEOPLE. UNEASY LET'S CHALLENGE OUR STUDENTS PLEASE VOTE FOR THIS BILL THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. THANK YOU SIR HUESO SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS. AFFECT MY THOUGHTS TOGETHER BECAUSE I THINK. MOST OF US ON THIS FLOOR PERHAPS ALL THIS JUST WITH EVERYTHING WE HAVE BEEN OBSERVING IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS HAVE A LOT OF STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT NOT ONLY THE ISSUE WE'RE DEBATING TODAY BUT SO MANY OF THE THINGS THAT. WE HAVE HAD NEW SPOT LIGHTS THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENT YES FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS BUT NEW SPOTLIGHTS ADDED. I REMEMBER AS A SECOND OR THIRD GRADER IN CATHOLIC SCHOOL HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN MY RELIGION CLASS WHEN WE LEARNED ABOUT THE MARK ON CAIN. CAME THE BROTHER WHO KILLED ABLE. WELL MY TEACHER DIDN'T SAY IT. EXPLICITLY IT WAS HINTED AND I UNDERSTOOD AND THEN LATER AT SOME POINT AT THE DINNER TABLE IN MY FAMILY. THE IMPLICATION WAS THAT BLACK PEOPLE ARE DESCENDANTS OF CAIN THE MARK OF CAIN WAS ON BLACK PEOPLE THEY'RE BLACK SKIN WAS GOD'S MARK. I'LL UP THE CURRENT REFERENCE TO CAME AND THIS IS WHAT IT'S- THE CURRENT REFERENCE. SOME TRADITIONAL BIBLICAL RELIGIOUS INTERPRETATIONS CONSIDER CAME TO BE THE ORIGINATOR OF EVIL VIOLENCE FOR FREE. THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THE SUBTLE. EXPLICIT AND OTHERWISE PERVASIVE WAYS MY GROWING UP AS A WHITE AMERICAN STEEP TO ME IN ACCEPTING AN NOT QUESTIONING SYSTEMIC RACISM I DID NOT EVEN UNDERSTAND IT. NOTE THE WORD TRADITION THROUGHOUT MY GROWING UP AS AN AMERICAN WHICH UNFORTUNATELY I THINK IS STILL TRUE TODAY. AMERICAN CULTURAL TRADITIONS BECAUSE THOSE CULTURAL TRADITIONS WERE DEVELOPED BY WHITE AMERICANS EXPLICITLY REINFORCE RACISM. AGAINST NATIVE AMERICANS AGAINST BLACKS AGAINST LACK NECKS. AND STE SO MANY OTHERS IN REINFORCE THE CANE STORY WITHOUT EXPLICITLY SAYING IT. NOW ADMITTEDLY MY SECOND GRADE WAS A LONG TIME AGO AND I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT NO CHILD IN AMERICA IS TALKED SUCH AS I WAS. BUT OUR REMIND US THAT THIS UNDERSTANDING A RELIGIOUS TRADITION AND SOMETHING THAT I COULD FIND EASILY RIGHT NOW WHEN I STARTED TO LOOK IT UP. I COULD RELATE VERY SIMILAR EXPERIENCES THOUGH NOT THE POLITICAL REFERENCES OR MAYBE I HAVEN'T LOOKED HARD ENOUGH ABOUT WHAT SHAPED MY PERCEPTION OF MEXICAN AMERICANS. THE VERY TOWN WERE MY CATHOLIC SCHOOL WAS LOCATED DID NOT ALLOW BLACKS MEXICANS ASIANS OR JEWS TO BUY HOUSES. MOST EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD HAD RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS DID ANYONE EXPLAIN THAT TO ME DID I LEARN ABOUT THAT IN ANY CLASS. DID ANYONE EVER MENTION. THE NC LORRAINE DOES EVERYBODY YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE JUST LIKE YOU AND ME NOW. THIS LEARNING THAT BE SIXTY WOULD. IS A SAY. WE AND WHAT WE DO IN UNDER. OR WHAT WE DO NOT. AB FOURTEEN SIXTY EXPRESSLY THE REQUIRED ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE ADDRESS SPECIFIC ETHNICITIES AND SPECIFIC TRADITIONS IN AMERICA. BUT ADDRESSING OTHER. BUT FOR MY POINT OF VIEW A ROUTER IF I LOOK AND I READ BILL NO WE'RE IN THE- DOES IT SAY. THAT THE COURSE UNDER FOURTEEN SIXTY MOST EXCLUDE. ARIEL THAT REALLY GIVES BACK FOR UNDERSTAND. OF THE INTEREST OF ALL OF THE WAY THAT YOU OR LAW OR HEY. AFFECT THE DIVERSITY AND SOCIAL OF THOSE ETHNICITIES SO ANOTHER WORDS IT IS NOT EXPLICITLY. THE FACT THAT OTHERS. HERE IN OUR COUNTRY HAVE EXPERIENCE BIAS AND DISCRIMINATION AND STILL TO TODAY AS WE KNOW SO MANY. OTHER JEWISH MUSLIM SEAT. AB FOURTEEN SIXTY REQUIRES THE COURSE ADDRESS DIVERSITY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE HISTORY A GOOD CURRICULUM THAT ADDRESSES THE DIVERSITY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE HISTORY OF THE US WILL DESCRIBE HOW MANY OF THE SAME LAWS THAT I DESCRIBED TRADITIONS AND PRACTICES. WERE ALSO ANTI SEMITIC FOR EXAMPLE WERE AIMED AT CHOOSE. AND IN I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT SUCH A COURSE WOULD NOT ADDRESS HOW EACH TIME WE SEE AN INCREASE IN HATE CRIMES WHETHER AGAINST BLACKS LET NEXT PEOPLE. WE SEE LIKE NOW EIGHT INCREASE IN ANTI SEMITIC ACTIONS SO THE INCORPORATION OF SUCH ISSUE SOME PARALLELS WOULD TO MY MIND NATURALLY BE INCLUDED IN SUCH A COURSE. SO I SEE AB FOURTEEN SIXTY AS A PATH TO PROVIDING AN EDUCATION ON ALL ASPECTS OF THE UNITED STATES SYSTEMIC APPLICATION OF BIAS AND DISCRIMINATION. AND WHILE MY COLLEAGUE DINNER FOR MARIN TO RACED BACK FORTUNATELY THERE ARE MANY GOOD COURSE OFFERINGS AT OUR CS. THESE ARE ELECTED. AB FOURTEEN SIXTY INSURERS THAT THE EDUCATION WE OFFER AT THIS GREAT PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM AND THE STUDENTS THAT ATTEND WILL RECEIVE THE BENEFIT OF THIS LEARNING. MY HOPE FOR THE EXPANSION OF THIS EDUCATIONAL OFFERING IS THAT HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE INFORMED DISCUSSION. ON ISSUES LIKE THE HISTORY AND ORIGINS OF POLICING THE HISTORY AND ORIGIN OF THE LABOR LAWS AGRICULTURAL LABOR LAWS FOR EXAMPLE WHY ARE NEIGHBORHOODS LOOK LIKE THEY DO. SECOND MAN INFORM OUR DEBATE ON SUCH ISSUES AS AFFIRMATIVE ACTION CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND SO MUCH MORE. I WISH THAT I HAD HAD SUCH A CLASS I WOULD BE A BETTER PERSON TODAY BY- TO VOTE ON AB FOURTEEN SIXTY. THANK YOU CENTER STAGE. A SCANNER SO% ALLEN. MEMBERS SAID I AGREE WITH SO MUCH OF WHAT'S BEEN SAID ON THE FLOOR TODAY- THERE'S SO MUCH WISDOM THAT'S ALREADY BEEN EXPRESSED. THE VALUE IN THE HISTORY OF ETHNIC STUDIES IN THIS PARTICULAR HISTORY WITH REGARDS TO THE CAL STATE SYSTEM AND ETHNIC STUDIES IS SO SPECIAL AND SOMETHING THAT WE OUGHT TO BE PROUD OF IS CALIFORNIANS- THE FACT IS THAT THIS WAS A MOVEMENT THAT REALLY WAS SPURRED. BY STUDENTS AND SOME YOUNG FACULTY GRADUATE STUDENTS AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE- BACK IN THE SIXTIES AS PART OF SOME OF THE EFFORTS THAT WERE DESCRIBED BY BY SOME MY COLLEAGUES. AND YOU KNOW I GOT TO SAY I PERSONALLY BENEFITED A GREAT DEAL FROM THAT MOVEMENT BECAUSE I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. OF STUDYING I TOOK SEVERAL CLASSES ENOUGH AMERICAN STUDIES AS AN UNDERGRADUATE I TOOK A LATINO CULTURES CLASS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY STUDY THE CREDIT PROFESSOR DR GOING OUT WEST BEEN A GUY BACK ON MY LESSONS IN ITS- FROM THAT. COURSE ALL THE TIME. AND HELPS ME. GET BETTER AND- OF- THE RICHEST OF OUR COUNTRY IN THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE- REALLY DO- UNDER. UNDER EXAMINE. SO MUCH OF THE- THE COMMON NARRATIVE THAT IS HANDED DOWN TO US. ABOUT AMERICAN HISTORY. AND THERE'S SO MUCH TO EXAMINE THERE IS SO MUCH TO EXAMINE- AND- EVERYTHING FROM- THE FACT THAT. THE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT THAT PICTURE. AT IN UTAH WHERE THEY- CELEBRATE THE CONSTRUCTION AND THE COMPLETION OF THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD. AND IS NOT A SINGLE ASIAN AMERICAN FACE IN THAT PICTURE. EVEN THOUGH WE ALL KNOW THAT. MOST OF THE CONSTRUCTION LEASE THE WESTERN PORTION OF THE WELL ROAD WAS DONE ON PRIMARILY BY CHINESE AMERICANS WHO REALLY SUFFERED IN LABOR UNDER INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT CONDITIONS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT THAN THE FOLKS BUILDING FROM THE FROM THE EAST. I YEAH WE REALLY YOU KNOW I THINK A LOT OF MY OWN COLLEAGUES PROBABLY DON'T REALIZE THAT THERE WAS EFFECTIVELY A STATE SPONSORED GENOCIDE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN THE EIGHTEEN FIFTIES AGAINST NEEDED CALIFORNIANS NATIVE AMERICANS. AND THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE PROFESSOR DOWN TO UCLA WHO INTERESTINGLY IS A MEMBER OF BOTH THE HISTORY DEPARTMENT AND- THE AMERICAN INDIAN STUDIES. DEPARTMENT THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL THEIR- WHO WROTE IN AMAZING BUT THAT- I GOT ON MY RADAR SCREEN BECAUSE IT JERRY BROWN GIVEN THE SPEECH ABOUT IT A HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY A COUPLE YEARS BACK THAT I. NOW HAVE IN REFERENCE- HI. YEAH THERE ARE SO MANY STORIES THERE ARE SO MANY STORIES AND GET UNDER TOLD AN UNDER APPRECIATED I THINK THIS MOMENT WE'RE STARTING TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS AND- A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY YOU KNOW WHY WE TAKE IT DOWN THE STATUES IT'S- THAT. YOU KNOW. TWO YOU KNOW IT IS EASY TO THING ABOUT THE STATUE OF COURSE. THAT THEY'RE BOTH- A COMMEMORATION OF THE MOMENT THAT THEIR COMMEMORATING SO IN THE CASE OF. OF THE CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS STATUE DOWN HERE. IT'S A IT'S A COMMEMORATION OF A FOURTEEN NINETY TWO. BUT IT'S ALSO COMMEMORATION OF THE MOMENT WHEN THAT STATUE WAS DECIDED TO BE PUT UP. RIGHT IT'S A IT'S A COMMEMORATION OF THE MOMENT OF EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO OR WHENEVER IT WAS THAT THAT WAS. THAT WAS PUT UP IN AND THE VALUES AT THAT TIME AND I THINK THAT'S- AN INTERESTING PART OF THE DISCUSSION OVER THE CONFEDERATE WAR STATUES RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT. ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR HISTORY. IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE VALUES THAT WENT BEHIND THOSE PEOPLE WHO DECIDED. TO CREATE MONUMENT AVENUE IN RICHMOND AND- AND THE KINDS OF VALUES THEY WERE TRYING TO UPHOLD AT THE TIME. THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING FOR US TO SPEND SOME TIME THINKING ABOUT AND CRITICIZING AND ENGAGING IN CLEARING. SO I CERTAINLY VERY MUCH. VERY MUCH- I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE'RE WE'RE NOW STARTED TAKE SERIOUSLY HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TO GET EXPOSURE TO AN TO GRAPPLE WITH THE KIND OF WORK THE KIND OF PEDAGOGY THAT IS AT THE HEART OF THE ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM. AND I WILL SAY YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THE ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE LET'S LET'S REMIND OURSELVES THIS ISN'T ONE COURSE RIGHT THAT THE IDEA HERE IS THAT IT'S A IT'S A GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS YOU CAN CHOOSE FROM A LONG LIST OF COURSES AND THOSE COURSES COULD INVOLVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT TOPICS IN IT'S ACTUALLY TRUE YOU CAN NOTE THAT THERE IS THERE SOME LIMITATION TO THIS BILL I MEAN THERE THERE'S- YOU KNOW YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TAKE A CLASS ON. YOUR BODY FOR DAN BUT YOU PROP TO TAKE A CLASS ON BETTY FRIEDAN IN CHILE. YOU KNOW THAT THAT WOULD. BRING TO THE INTO. NOW OF FEMINISM AND REYES AN AFRICAN STUDIES- SO THAT THAT WOULD BE I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD START TO SEE. IN THE COURSES THAT WOULD BE DEVELOPED. I DO YOU KNOW. HE TO THE EXTENT OF THE CAL STATE IS ALREADY OBSOLETE GOING THROUGH THEIR OWN PROCESS OF TRYING TO COME UP WITH A REQUIREMENT THAT IS RESPONSIVE TO OUR WHAT THE AUTHORS LOOKING TO DO HERE- I THINK THAT WILL ALREADY YOU KNOW IMPROVE SOME OF THE COSTS THAT. THE MY GOOD FRIEND- FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY WAS WAS WAS TALKING ABOUT. THERE WERE THERE THERE CERTAINLY WOULD BE SOME COSTS ASSOCIATED BUT I ALWAYS I DON'T THINK IT'S QUITE. AS HIGH AS AND AS IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED JUST GIVEN. THE WORK THAT'S ALREADY UNDER WAY WITHIN THE CAL STATE SYSTEM AND I GUESS I DO WANT TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT THAT I MAKE. I HEAR A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES SAYING WE NEED TO PUSH THE YOU SEE THE SENATE CAL STATE TO ACT NOW. AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO WITH BILLS RIGHT A LOT OF TIMES WE USE BILLS AS IT OPPORTUNITY AS A VEHICLE TO PUSH GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. AND I WILL SAY I DO SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM HER INTO. IN TERMS OF PRESSURE- YOU KNOW I CAN IT'S NOT LOST ON ME. IT'S NOT LOST ON ME. THAT THAT THAT IN SOME OF OUR SISTER AND BROTHER STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE LEGISLATORS. WHO ARE GOING IN AND ASKING THEIR UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS TO FIRE. PROFESSORS FOR TAKING ON CONTROVERSIAL STANCES AND BY THE WAY THERE OFTENTIMES THE VERY SAME PROFESSORS WHO TEACH IN THE CLASSES THAT WE WANT TO SEE TAUGHT UNDER THIS REQUIREMENT. AND THAT'S A DANGEROUS THING I THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT I DO I DO RESPECTFULLY PUSH BACK ON MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO WHEN HE SAID THAT HE DOESN'T SEE ANY PROBLEM WITH LEGISLATOR. WEIGHING IN AND DICTATING TERMS IN TERMS OF EDUCATION BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT THERE THERE'S A THERE'S A SLIPPERY SLOPE HERE. THERE'S A SLIPPERY SLOPE HERE AND- AND THE CAL STATE HAS TAKEN ACTION I MEAN TO SAY THAT THEY HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING IS NOT TRUE. THEY THEY'VE NINETEEN OUT OF THE TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES HAVE TAKEN STEPS- WITH REGARDS TO AN ETHNIC STUDIES REQUIREMENT AND THEY'VE NOW NOTICED. THIS REQUIREMENT. FOR US INTO A DISCUSSION OF THE CAL TO PASS A POLICY AT THE JULY MEETING. SO THERE'S NO QUESTION DRUG THE FOR THEIR TO THEY DID THEY DID SO MANY AGENTS DO COLLEGE OUT OF THIS MEMBER OF BODY THAT RUN A BILL TO PUSH OUR GOVERNMENT AGENTS THAT WAS JUST DRAGGING ITS FEET. ADD TO THAT YEAH WE DO HAVE THIS POWER OF THE CAL STATE WE DON'T HAVE IT OVER THE YOU SEE TO CLARIFY YOU KNOW MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY THE UC HAS CONSTITUTIONAL TANAMI UNDER ARTICLE NINE OF OUR CONSTITUTION THAT WOULDN'T ALLOW FOR A BILL LIKE THIS. WITH THE GUARDS THE UC. WE COULD DO A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. HI BUT WE COULDN'T TELL THEM WHAT TO DO IN TERMS OF SETTING THEIR GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS. SO ARE AYE I REALLY HOPE. I'M SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY I MADE A COMMITMENT TO THE AUTHOR A LONG TIME AGO AND I THINK IT'S I CAN'T HELP IT. YOU KNOW A VASTLY EMBRACE THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF STUDYING. THE TOPICS THAT WE SEE TO HAVE STUDIED UNDER THIS BILL AND I WILL SAY. THAT THAT IS AS OBSOLETE MERITORIOUS AS OTHER SUBJECTS ARE. INCLUDING SOME OF THE SUBJECTS THAT ARE COVERED UNDER THE DIVERSITY REQUIREMENT. THERE IS A- THERE IS SOMETHING IMPORTANT THERE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL THERE'S SOMETHING DEEPLY. VITAL ABOUT STUDYING ISSUES RELATED TO RACE. IN THIS COUNTRY AND THE CHALLENGES AND THE HISTORY THAT EVENTS IT'S BEEN FACED BY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND I THINK THIS MOMENT CERTAINLY UNDERSCORES. THE INCREDIBLE IMPORTANCE OF STANDING THOSE KINDS OF QUESTIONS OF THOSE GRAND GRAPPLING WITH A HISTORY. BUT I DO I DO HOPE. AND I REALLY HOPE AND I KNOW WE'VE GOT A VERY THOUGHTFUL AUTHOR HERE- IN THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM SAN DIEGO IT'S MY STRONG HOPE AND I KNOW THE GOVERNOR CARES ABOUT THIS TOO BECAUSE IN THE END OF THE DAY I MEAN AS MUCH AS WE MAY WANT TO EXTERNALIZE THE DECISIONS OF THIS YES YOU WE HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR DECISIONS TO MEMBERS WE- APPROVE EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO SITS ON THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES. AND WE SHOULD BE USING THE RULES COMMITTEE PROCESS AND MAYBE WE SHOULD BE HAVING A MORE ROBUST. PROCESS FOR THE ENTIRE BODY. WHEN IT COMES TO THE APPROVAL AN APPOINTMENT. OF THESE FOLKS THAT WE SEND TO RUN THE UC SYSTEM AND SEND THE CALIFORNIA RUN THE CAL STATE SYSTEM AND ALL THESE OTHER. COMMISSIONS AND BOARDS AND BODIES. MAYBE THAT PROCESS IS TO CLOSE MADE OR NOT ASKING ENOUGH QUESTIONS OF THESE MEMBERS. TO ENSURE THAT WE REALLY TRUST THAT THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE THE KINDS OF LESSONS THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING TODAY TO HEART WHEN THEY'RE MAKING TOUGH DECISIONS. AT THE BOARD. SO I HOPE I'VE HEARD MY COLLEAGUES SAY THEY WANT TO KEEP THIS DISCUSSION GOING THEY WANT TO KEEP THIS BILL ALIVE THEY WANT TO. THEY WANT THEY WANT TO KEEP MOVING THIS DISCUSSION FOR SO LET'S TAKE THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE THE GOVERNOR IF THIS PASSES OUT OF OUR LEGISLATURE HAVE THE GOVERNOR THE CAL STATE. AND THE AUTHOR. AND THE SPONSORS SIT DOWN TOGETHER. AND SEE WHAT THEY CAN WORK OUT IT IS ABSOLUTELY OPTIMAL FOR THIS DECISION FOR IT IS BETTER. FOR THIS DECISION TO BE MADE BY THE CAL STATE BOARD. AND IF THEY CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO COME UP WITH A GOOD AGREEMENT THAT MEETS THE GOALS OF THE AUTHOR. WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WITHOUT COMMITMENT WITHOUT PROMISED IN THE GOVERNOR'S VETO THIS BILL. I ALSO DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH LEGISLATION BEING USED TO PRESSURE AGENCIES AND I THINK THAT'S I THINK WE'VE HEARD OUR COLLEAGUE SAYING THAT THAT'S A LOT OF REASONS WHY THERE. WHETHER VOTE TO PASS THIS BILL TODAY SO I'M GONNA VOTE FOR THIS BILL WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING I'M HOPEFUL THAT IT WILL LEAD TO A FRUITFUL MEETING FOR DISCUSSION THAT WILL LEAD TO MEANINGFUL CHANGE OF THE CAL STATE THAT WILL FINALLY RECTIFIED AND I THINK. BRING TO SOME. SOME CELEBRATION I SUPPOSE OF THE MOVEMENT THAT WAS FIRST STARTED ON THE CAL STATE CAMPUS IN SAN FRANCISCO IN THE SIXTIES. THAT HAS COME SO FAR BUT THAT STILL HAS SO MUCH FURTHER TO GO IN HELPING TO RESHAPE OUR ACADEMY HELPING TO. FORCE OUR SOCIETY AND OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TO START ASKING MORE CRITICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT AMERICA'S COMPLICATED COMPLICATED HISTORY. THANK YOU SENATOR ALLEN SENATOR JACKSON. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT COLLEGE THIS IS BEEN A VERY. FASCINATING DISCUSSION AND I HAVE- EXPERIENCE SOME OF THE ANGST ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ROLE IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM. BUT I AM COMFORTABLE WITH THAT THE IN THIS INSTANCE BECAUSE IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION AGAINST THE LEGISLATURE INTERFERING. WITH OUR- UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA IS IN THE CONSTITUTION. THE SAME IS NOT TRUE WHEN IT COMES TO THE C. ISSUES N OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO AS THE LAWYER IN ME AS AS SOMEONE WHO IS CONCERNED ABOUT DOING SOMETHING THAT TO TODAY THAT IN TWENTY YEARS MIGHT BE USED BY SOMEONE WITH WHOM I TOTALLY DISAGREE. TO IMPOSE POLICIES WITH WHICH I TOTALLY DISAGREE IS SOMETHING THAT THE DOESN'T RISE TO THAT LEVEL OF FOR ME TODAY AND PERHAPS FOR OTHERS. I AM BEING ONE OF THE MORE SENIOR MEMBERS OF THIS HOUSE. I REMEMBER THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT LED BY. THE GREAT DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING. ADD TO THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON WHICH IS SIMILAR IN MANY WAYS TO SOME OF THE MARCHES THAT WE ARE SEEING TODAY IS THE PUBLIC IS RISING UP. AGAIN IN OUTRAGE AND INDIGNATION AT THE KIND OF POLICIES THAT EXIST IN THIS COUNTRY THAT HAVE PERPETUATED. SLAVERY A SYSTEM THAT IS AS OLD AS OUR REPUBLIC. AND SO IS SOMEONE WHO LIVED THROUGH THAT AND FAST FORWARD TO TODAY- WE'RE STILL SEEING THIS KIND OF BLATANT OUTRAGEOUS RACISM IN OUR COUNTRY. BUT I'M HOPEFUL THAT MAYBE TODAY. WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. ARE CERTAINLY ALL OF US WHO ARE HERE NONE OF US WERE IN A POSITION OF AUTHORITY AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE PUBLIC POLICY FOR THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER AND I WAS MUCH YOUNGER THEN- ON THE STREETS PROTESTING WITH EVERYBODY WHO FELT THAT THIS INJUSTICE WAS NOT ACCEPTABLE IN THIS COUNTRY. BUT AS I LISTEN AND LOOK AND AM CONCERNED AS A AS A WOMAN WHO HAS LIVED THE LIFE WHERE I'VE EXPERIENCED INCREDIBLE GENDER BIASES MOST WOMEN HAVE EXPERIENCED. IN THIS SECTION ASSUME THAT IS STILL. DEEPLYARE ENDEMIC IN OUR SOCIETY I ASK WHAT ABOUT. GENDER BIAS WHAT ABOUT SEXISM. WHAT ABOUT AS WAS MENTIONED THE WAY THE ASIAN AMERICANS WERE TREATED AND FORCED INTO A FORM OF SLAVERY BACK IN THE EIGHTEEN FIFTIES TO DEVELOP CALIFORNIA WHAT ABOUT WHAT ABOUT WHAT ABOUT THERE ARE SO MANY INSTANCES OF DISCRIMINATION THAT HAVE EXISTED IN THIS COUNTRY SO I ASK MYSELF WHAT IS DISCRIMINATION WHY IS THERE DISCRIMINATION. WE HAVE DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE OF FEAR AND IGNORANCE. THAT IS WHAT GENERATES HATE. YOUR AND IGNORANCE AND I THINK IT IS ABOUT TIME THAT WE ADDRESS THE IGNORANCE PART OF THIS AND IF IT MEANS THAT WE PASS FOURTEEN SIXTY THAT IDENTIFIES FOUR BASIC GROUPS THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED. AND UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT IS REALLY THE FLOOR THAT'S THE BASICS THAT WE CAN ADD TO THIS BECAUSE THERE IS ENORMOUS CHANGE THEIR SEXUALITY. OF ALL THESE ISSUES BLACK WOMEN LUCKY NECKS. AND LETTING US. PEOPLE OF ALL DIFFERENT RACES PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT RELIGIOUS PERSPECTIVES AND AS A JEW I CAN ASSURE YOU I HAVE BEEN THE VICTIM OF ANTI SEMITISM WHICH STILL RUNS TODAY FAIRLY UNABASHEDLY. WE HATE BLACKS WE HATE JEWS WE HATE FILL IN THE BLANK. WE HAVE GOT TO ADDRESS THE FEAR AND IGNORANCE IN OUR COUNTRY. IT IS INEXCUSABLE THAT IN THE NATION IT WAS BUILT BY SLAVES AND BUILD BY WOMEN AND BUILT BY PEOPLE OF COLOR. THERE WE SHOULD STILL HAVE A COUNTRY THAT TRIES AT EVERY POSSIBLE CHANCE TO PUT THOSE PEOPLE THERE. AND SO I AM GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL IT IS MY HOPE THAT AS THE- CAL STATE UNIVERSITY- OUR DISCUSSION IS HOW TO BEST UNDERMINE THE FEAR AND THE HATRED AND THE IGNORANCE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT EDUCATION IS SUPPOSED TO DO. IT IS SUPPOSED TO EDUCATE AND REMOVE IGNORANCE SO THAT PEOPLE MAKE DECISIONS AND IS MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO MENTIONED THE PURPOSE OF EDUCATION IS TO TEACH PEOPLE TO THINK CRITICALLY. GIVE PEOPLE THE AXE GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE WITH OTHERS AND WHAT WILL WE FIND THAT WE ARE ALL HUMAN BEINGS. GUARD LIST OF OURS REGARDLESS OF OUR OF OUR RACIAL COMPOSITION REGARDLESS OF MARBLE RELIGIOUS BELIEFS WE ARE ALL HUMAN BEINGS. AND THAT IS REALLY THE PROMISE OF THIS COUNTRY IT IS A PROMISE THAT THIS BILL TRIES TO START OVER AGAIN. LET'S HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS LET'S TALK ABOUT THE HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE IN THIS COUNTRY HISTORY SOMETHING WE DON'T REALLY GIVE A WHOLE LOT OF CONSIDERATION TO ANYMORE. BUT I THINK HISTORY IS ONE OF THE MOST INVALUABLE THINGS WE CAN DO BECAUSE THE TIMES MAY CHANGE BUT HUMAN NATURE WILL NEVER CHANGE. AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE PROVIDE THOSE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES THAT THIS MEASURE WILL AGAIN REYES AND MAKE PART OF A YOUNG PERSON'S EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND IT IS MY HOPE AS WELL. THAT THE A CAL STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM WILL COME UP WITH THE BEST PLAN AND THAT THIS BILL WILL HAVE BEEN AN INCENTIVE BUT NOT THE END OF THIS DISCUSSION. AND SO THAT AND ON BEHALF OF ALL. THE MEN. ARE IN AND OTHERS WHO HAVE AND SHE EXT THIS KIND OF DISCRIMINATION BUT ONBEHALF OF THOSE GROUPS THAT ARE NOW FIGHTING FOR JUSTICE THAT THAT HAD THAT HAS BEEN THAT IS LONG OVERDUE. IT IS FOR ALL OF US IN THE FACT THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO RAISE THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AND ADDRESS THOSE INHERENT OF FEELINGS OF PREJUDICE AND DISCRIMINATION AND OVERCOME THEM. THERE CAN BE I THINK NO GREATER. EFFORT AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY. ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND THANK THE AUTHOR- FOR HER COURAGE I IN RAISING THIS ISSUE AND HOPE THAT THE CAL STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IS LISTENING CAREFULLY TO THIS DEBATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR JACKSON CENTER GALGIANI. THANK YOU MEMBERS YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS FOUR YEARS OLD THE KING AND THE QUEEN OF THE GYPSIES OF CALIFORNIA MOVE NEXT DOOR MY GRANDPARENTS. THOSE WERE THE FONDEST MEMORIES OF MY CHILDHOOD. AND WE'RE STILL FRIENDS TO THIS DAY FIFTY TWO YEARS LATER. IT WAS A RICH EXPERIENCE FOR ME- YET WHEN I WAS YOUNGER AND BY THE TIME I WAS IN SECOND GRADE MY PARENTS HAD DIVORCED AND WE WERE SPENDING A LOT OF TIME AT MY GRANDPARENTS HOUSE AND WE WERE ALWAYS GOING OVER THE GYPSIES HOUSE. BECAUSE THERE I HAD THREE MOMS THAT PAID ATTENTION TO ME THERE WERE THREE GENERATIONS IN THE FAMILY. AND I HAD MY FRIENDS JANEANE LARA DOROTHY. AND MANY OTHERS THAT WERE AT THE HOME ALL THE TIME. AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT RACISM WAS WHEN I WAS IN FIRST AND SECOND GRADE. BUT IN MEMORY THAT I STILL HOLD ALL THESE YEARS LATER WAS BEING OUT WITH MY GYPSY FRIENDS WHO ARE PROUD TO CALL THEMSELVES GYPSIES BY THE WAY. AND SOME WOMEN LOOKING OVER TO US. AND I REMEMBER FEELING HURT AND I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING. BUT DINA WHO WAS WITH US SHE SAID. THE LADY SAID WERE MIL LOLLY. WERE DIRTY AND THEIR LANGUAGE MALALA EIGHT THIRTY I REMEMBER THAT ALL THESE YEARS LATER WE WEREN'T DIRTY WE WERE DRESSED UP WE'RE WEARING DRESSES. WHAT SHE MET WITH SOMETHING ELSE AND IT WASN'T UNTIL LATER THAT I UNDERSTOOD WHAT THAT WAS BUT I WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER IT. AND TO THIS DAY WHEN I TALK ABOUT MY FRIENDS WHO WERE GYPSIES I STILL HEAR THINGS THAT ARE DEROGATORY ABOUT THEM AND IT HURTS BECAUSE I LOVE THEM DEARLY LIKE MY OWN FAMILY TO THIS DAY. I TOOK A WOMEN OF COLOR CLASSES SACRAMENTO STATE AND THERE'S SO MUCH THAT I DON'T REMEMBER THAT I LEARNED IN COLLEGE. BUT THOSE WERE LIFETIME LESSONS THAT I LEARNED THAT I TOOK WITH ME. I AM PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR GALGIANI SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I JUST WANT TO ADD MY VOICE TO THIS CONVERSATION- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE JUST A MOMENT TO REFLECT THE TIMES THAT WERE IN THE DISCUSSIONS THAT EVERY FAMILIES ARE HAVING IN LIVING ROOMS ACROSS OUR NATION AND- I WANT TO FIRST OF ALL THANK THE AUTHOR I KNOW THAT IT'S BEEN- A MISSION FOR HER AND SEVENTEEN THAT SHE'S WORKED DILIGENTLY ON. I DON'T WANT TO THINK DOCTOR WEBER IT'S NOT AN EASY TOPIC TO EMBARK ON- AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK ALL MY COLLEAGUES HERE FOR ARE YOU YOUR COMMENTS I THINK ALL OF YOU HAVE VALID POINTS IN ALL OF YOU ARE VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN AND I JUST WANT TO ADD MY VOICE AS A TEACHER- I REMEMBER T. EIGHTEEN. OP SOCIAL STUDIES NATIVE AMERICAN HISTORY FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS AND I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF MY BIGGEST FRUSTRATIONS AS I YOU KNOW LOOK THROUGH THE CURRICULUM IS FINDING MYSELF CONSTANTLY TAKING OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM OUTSIDE THE- GIVING CURRICULUM TO FIND THE REAL HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE I THINK THAT- WE FIND OURSELVES NOT RESPECTING OUR STUDENTS. BY TRYING TO GIVE THEM INFORMATION NOTS WATERED DOWN AND DOESN'T REALLY THE FLAT THE TRUE HISTORY OF THIS STATE AND THIS COUNTRY AND- AND BECAUSE OF THOSE STRUGGLES I ALWAYS FIND MYSELF REACHING OUT TO THOSE EVERY NEW- SOME OF THE TRIBES ENGAGING IN CONVERSATION SO I REALLY WANTED TO UNDERSTAND AND I REALLY WANT MY STUDENTS TO HAVE. THE TRUE INFORMATION SO THEN THEY CAN REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED HERE I THINK THAT IF WE GIVE THEM HISTORY AND REALLY HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE MISTAKES HE MADE CAN ONLY MAKE THEM STRONGER AND BETTER FOR IT AND HOPEFULLY THEY STILL REPEAT SOME OF THE MISTAKES TAT WE'VE MADE BECAUSE I THINK EVERY GENERATION WE GROW LITTLE BY LITTLE WE GIRL AND I HOPE THAT- WE HAVEN'T STOPPED GROWING AND THIS IS JUST ONCE AT. FORWARD AND GROOMING A NECK GEN. THAT GOING TO BE. UNDERSTANDING MORE ABOUT THAT A- LITTLE BIT MORE AWARE OF THEIR SURROUNDINGS AND REALLY I THINK THIS BOILS DOWN TO UNDERSTANDING. UNDERSTANDING OTHER PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THEIR STRUGGLES AND I THINK WE CAN ONLY BE A BETTER STATE FOR IT AND SO I CALLED PARTY. AT MY VOICE TO THOSE THAT SUPPORTED THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. I COULD JUST CAST A VOTE HERE- QUIETLY IN SIR TO PROCEED. VERY RICH IN FULL DEBATE BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT ADD MY VOICE TO THE CONVERSATION. I DON'T WANT TO BE A RELUCTANT HI VOTE. I DON'T WANT TO BE A SHEEPISH AYE VOTES I DON'T WANT TO FEEL. OR YOU ALL THE FEEL THAT THIS VOTE IS BEING CAST JUST BECAUSE OF THIS MOMENT BECAUSE- THERE'S SO MUCH MOMENTUM HERE AND JUST HAS TO BE DONE. THERE'S A MOMENT TO BE PROUD OF A VOTE LIKE THIS. THE MOMENT TO BE PROUD TO STAND UP AND SAY THE ISSUE OF RACE SPECIFICALLY. NEEDS TO BE TALKED ABOUT. THIS IS A MOMENT WHERE IT'S VERY EASY. TO LOOK AT THE HOLES AND SAY WHO'S MISSING. AND I HAVE THAT SAME. INSTINCT POP UP IN MYSELF. EVEN GOING THROUGH WHAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH IN LOS ANGELES OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS. WHEN YOU SEE A SYNAGOGUE GET DESECRATED. OR ANTI SEMITIC HATRED RISE ONLINE YOU SAY THIS IS THE MEMORIA TO STAND UP AND SAY NO TO ANTI SEMITISM AND WHERE IS WHERE IS THAT EXPERIENCE IN THIS BILL AND WHERE IS THIS IN OUR DIALOGUE. THIS IS SINGULARLY A MOMENT RIGHT NOW. THAT IS ABOUT BEING A PERSON OF COLOR A WALKING AROUND IN A BLACK BODY IN THIS COUNTRY BEING DIFFERENT THEY'RE WALKING AROUND IN A WHITE BODY. THAT EVEN THOUGH IN FIFTY YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS FIVE YEARS OLD I WENT TO THE SAME KINDERGARTEN CLASS THAT. MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES WENT TO WE BOTH WERE IN THE SAME SCHOOL PLAY I PLAYED MARTIN LUTHER KING AT FIVE YEARS OLD. SHE HELPED BUILD THE VOTING BOOTH IN THAT SAME- BIT OF CHILD PETER WE DID. AND YET IN MY MIND AT THE TIME I DIDN'T REALIZE WILL. YEAH I CAN BE JUST LIKE MARTIN LUTHER KING THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT AT THE TIME. WHITE KID GROWING UP. NICE PART LA. NOT REALIZING THAT. THERE'S SOMETHING FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT. AND FUNDAMENTALLY HARDER ABOUT WALKING DOWN THE STREET. RIDING A BICYCLE GOING TO GET YOUR LUNCH ALL THOSE SMALL MOMENTS THAT YOU DON'T NOTICE IN YOUR LIFE. IF WE CAN'T TALK SINGULARLY ABOUT RACE IN THIS MOMENT. AND FORCE THAT. THAT GREAT ON KNOWING THAT JAMES BALDWIN TALKED ABOUT NOT IN NOT EVEN IN IGNORANCE BUT A CONSCIOUS ON KNOWING. AN ACTUAL INTENTIONAL AVOIDANCE OF THE ISSUE- MISEDUCATION NOT A LACK OF EDUCATION A MISS EDUCATION. WE PRESENT A VERSION OF HISTORY IN THIS CAPITAL WHEN PEOPLE WALK IN. IN OUR CLASSROOMS IN OUR CURRICULUM AND WE'VE WAITED IN THE CURRICULUM BEFORE. WE TELL YOUNG PEOPLE LEARN ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT IN THERE K. TWELVE EDUCATION. WE URGE THEM TO LEARN ABOUT. GENOCIDES IN WARS. I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THAT POSTURE AND THAT THEIR RETICENCE TO REACH TOO DEEPLY OF OUR POLITICS BUT IF WE ARE NOT EDUCATING YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT RACE. AND FORCING THAT COLLISION. AND FORCING KIDS OUT OF THEIR SHELL WE ARE MISS EDUCATING OUR CHILDREN. IT'S NOT THAT THE- THEY NOW HAVE A SUPER CHARGED EDUCATION THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE JUST GONNA BE GRADUATE WITHOUT THAT BLIND SPOT. WE'RE DOCUMENT THREE UNITS HERE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A CLASS. I UNDERSTAND THE PROCEDURAL CONCERNS. INTERVENING INTO EXISTING AGENCIES WORK BUT. YOU KNOW THERE THERE IS A RISK AT THIS MOMENT THE WORD ETHNIC GOES BACK TO THE WORD ETHNOS A COMES FROM GREEK ETYMOLOGY. THE WORD THEY USED FOR OTHER. ETHNOS WAS ALSO MENTIONED IN THE FIRST GREEK TRANSLATION OF THE HEBREW BIBLE. THE TALK ABOUT NON JEWS OTHERS GOYIM. BUT THAT WORD ETHNOS. NOW PIERS TODAY AS ETHNIC WHAT IS OTHER. THERE HAVE BEEN MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN OTHERS THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY. AND CERTAINLY NOW THE OTHER. AND THE WAY WE TREATED IS PEOPLE BY COLOR THEIR SKIN. BUT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHERS BECAUSE OF THEIR RELIGION. BECAUSE OF THEIR GENDER. BECAUSE THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS. AND THE RISK IN THIS MOMENT IS CASTING. THAT BERRIER OF OTHERNESS WHEN WE ALL HAVE TO FIND SOME BRIDGES BETWEEN. OUR TRIBES. IF YOU GO BACK TO THE CURRENT BIBLE VERSES IN THIS WEEK EVEN THE DIVISION OF ALL THE TRIBES EVEN AMONGST JEWS THERE WERE TWELVE TRIBES AND THEY ALL WANTED TO WAR AMONGST EACH OTHER AND FIND THEIR OWN ETHNIC LINES THAT DIVIDE THEMSELVES. BUT WHEN WE ARE MURMURING AGAINST ONE ANOTHER WE BECOME A TOWER OF BABEL. WE GET NOTHING DONE. LET'S BE CLEAR IN OUR VOICE TODAY. I'LL BE CLEAR THIS MOMENT IS ABOUT A CONVERSATION. ABOUT ETHNICITY BUT AS THE BILL MENTIONS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT RACIALIZED MINORITIES AND WHAT IT IS TO GO THROUGH LIFE THAT WAY. I PROBABLY SUPPORT THIS BILL. AND I HOPE WE CAN MOVE THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION FORD IS LEGISLATURE IN A WAY THAT. REALLY RECTIFY IS OUR TROOPS IN HISTORY. BUT THROUGH THAT TRUTH SOME KIND OF RECONCILIATION. THANK YOU CENTER STERN CENTER CHIANG. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. THIS IS THIS IS A TOUGH VOTE FOR ME I KEEP GOING BACK AND FORTH AND- I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM. AROUND A AND ALSO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA MONICA. YOU KNOW WE DO NEED TO SET A HIGH BAR FOR IMPOSING REQUIREMENTS ON THE CSU AND IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR THE CSU TO DO IT ON THEIR OWN. BUT I FEEL LIKE THIS MOMENT. CALLS FOR THAT CHANGE. I KEEP GOING BACK AND FORTH BECAUSE YOU KNOW THROUGHOUT MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE ALMOST WEEKLY. I AM SUBJECT TO SOME OF RACISM SOME TYPE OF RACISM AND AS THE ONLY ASIAN AMERICAN WOMAN IN THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW. I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO SPEAK UP. AND YOU KNOW IT'S TOUGH BECAUSE I KEEP GOING BACK TO THIS ONE TIME I LOVE KNOCKING ON DOORS I LOVE TALKING TO PEOPLE AND I'M NOT GOING ON THIS ONE DOOR AND THIS WOMAN OPENED THE DOOR AND SHE SAID I WILL NEVER VOTE FOR AN ORIENTAL. AND I SAID BUT WHY SO I SPENT FORTY FIVE MINUTES AT HER DOOR. AND EIGHTY IT WAS CLEAR TO ME THAT. IT WAS MORE OF. IGNORANCE IT WASN'T SO MUCH HATRED BUT THERE WAS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING. THAT HEY WE ARE ALL THE SAME. YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL HERE. TRYING TO HELP THE COMMUNITY TRYING TO SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY. AND AFTER THAT FORTY FIVE MINUTES I WON HER OVER AND SHE ENDED UP ASKING ME HOW MY HOUSE AND I WILL FOR THE REST OF THE BILL. BUT HERE BUT THAT'S THE THING IS IT'S NOT SO MUCH HATRED BUT WE SHOULD STOP IT. WE SHOULD NIP THAT RIGHT AT THE BLOOD. TO KILL. IGNORANCE BECAUSE IN IGNORANCE BECOMES. HATRED YOU KNOW IT CAN BECOME HATRED. AND AGAIN LIKE LIKE LIKE I SAID I'M SITTING HERE GOING BACK AND FORTH. BUT ULTIMATELY YOU KNOW I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I HAVE TO SUPPORT BECAUSE IF WE CAN OF- KILL HATRED BY JUST INFORMING AND EDUCATING YOU KNOW OUR STUDENTS TO THINK CRITICALLY TO THINK IN A DIFFERENT WAY. TO SEEK MORE UNDERSTANDING I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY. THANK YOU CENTER CHIANG SEEING NO OTHER MIKE SUB MISTER BRADFORD WOULD YOU CARE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND I WANNA THANK ALL MY COLLEAGUES FOR THIS. HEARTFELT AND HEALTHY DEBATE ON ISSUE REALLY NOT OF EDUCATION AGAIN A ISSUE OF. RACE IN AMERICA- ISSUE OF THE MIS EDUCATION OF AMERICANS- THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE WE'VE HEARD THAT ECHOED SO MANY TIMES FROM SO MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES. BECAUSE OF THE- MISS EDUCATION THERE WAS A BOOK THE MIS EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO. BECAUSE FOR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS WE HAVE BEEN LIED TO ABOUT WHAT THIS HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY IS REALLY ABOUT. BEEN THE MISEDUCATION OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF NOT ONLY THE NEGRO BUT NATIVE AMERICANS OF ASIANS AS WE HEARD OF OUR LATINO BROTHERS AND SISTERS. IT'S BEEN WHITEWASHED IN OUR HISTORY BOOKS AT OUR UNIVERSITIES BUT HERE'S A OPPORTUNITY TODAY MEMBERS TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT. AND IT'S NOT TO EXCLUDE ANY OTHER GROUP BUT TO INCLUDE THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND FOR SO LONG. IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO AGAIN RIGHT THE WRONGS WERE COME INTO THIS WORLD WITH ONLY TWO FEARS THE FEAR FALLING THE FEAR LAW WHILE LOUD NOISES EVERYTHING ELSE IS TAUGHT. SO WE HATE ONE ANOTHER IT'S TAUGHT IN OUR UNIVERSITIES IS THOUGHT AND I'LL IMAGES GOES IT'S TAUGHT IN OUR HOMES. AND. WHAT'S OFTEN STATED A PEOPLE WHO DO NOT KNOW THEIR HISTORY ARE DOOMED TO REPEAT IT THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO KNOW OUR HISTORY WE HAVE ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES SAY WHY NOW WELL DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING SAYS THE TIME IS ALWAYS RIGHT TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND IF NOT NOW THEN WHEN HE ALSO SPOKE OF THE URGENCY OF NOW AND URGENCY IT NOW HAS BEEN CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED OVER THE LAST THREE WEEKS IN THIS COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD THAT WE NEED A SYSTEMIC CHANGE WHEN IT COMES TO TALKING ABOUT. OUR GREAT DIVERSITY BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY OUR ETHNIC DIFFERENCES HERE IN THIS COUNTRY AND HERE'S OPPORTUNITY BY A FOURTEEN INDIVIDUALS TO LEARN. I GREW UP IN A HOSTILE WORK. BOTH MY PARENTS WERE COLLEGE EDUCATED HAVING REPORT. MY FATHER OWNED HIS OWN BUSINESS MY MOTHER WAS A NURSE ALL MY FAMILY. MY MOTHER'S SISTERS ALL COLLEGE EDUCATED OUR PROFESSORS ARE PRESENT PRINTABLE THAT SCHOOLS. N. B. INSTILLED IN ME THE IMPORTANCE OF NóI MY HISTORY. AND I WENT TO COLLEGE AS A FRESHMAN AT SAN DIEGO STATE TO. AT THE BIOLOGY MAJOR WITH EVERY INTENTION OF BEING A DOCTOR NOT A POLITICIAN NOT A SENATOR BUT A DOCTOR. AND IT WAS A FRESHMAN CLASS THAT I TOOK. TAUGHT BY A PROFESSOR DR SHIRLEY WEBER. AFTER AN AMERICAN STUDIES COURTS. AND I DROPPED IT THREE WEEKS INTO IT BECAUSE I HAD A BETTER CHANCE OF PASSING MICROBIOLOGY THAT AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES BECAUSE I REALIZED HOW ILL EQUIPPED EDUCATED I WAS TO KNOW ABOUT MY OWN HISTORY AND ABOUT MY OLD CULTURE AND AS OFTEN SAY HAD I STAYED IN THAT CLASS I MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMEBODY. BUT I'M HERE TODAY TO SAY IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT WE MOVE FOR WITH THIS MEASURE. IT'S NOT ABOUT COST BECAUSE THE COST ABOUT DIGNITY IS FAR GREATER THAN THE COST OF. WHAT DOES PROGRAMS GONNA ACOSTA UNIVERSITIES WE HAVE PLENTY MONEY TO FUND THOSE THINGS THAT WE FEEL WARM PART. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE TO AGAIN. EDUCATE NOT ONLY ARE CALIFORNIANS I STARTED WITH. H. B. C. USE I AGAIN I CHALLENGE ANY OF YOU TO HAVE A DEBATE ON AMERICAN HISTORY WITH SOMEONE WHO WENT TO H. B. C. USE PROBLEMS THEY'RE FAR MORE PREPARED BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE HISTORY. I WENT TO A- ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WHERE I WAS PROBABLY ONE OF FIFTY BLACK KIDS AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL THERE WAS ONE AFTER AMERICAN TEACHERS IN THAT SCHOOL. HER NAME WAS JACQUELINE HALLS. IN A WOMAN CHANGE MY LIFE. BUT SHE GRADUATED AT SPELMAN COLLEGE SHE BABY SAT MARTIN LUTHER KING AND SHE TAUGHT ME A AND ALL MY OTHER DIVERSE CLASSMATES BUT THE HISTORY OF NOT ONLY THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT BUT THE RICH CONTRIBUTIONS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS TO THIS COUNTRY. AND I THANK HER FOR THAT. AND I HAD- IN THE FOURTH GRADE. IN A PROGRESS TO THE FIFTH GRADE. LOOKED AROUND I HAVE MISSILES AGAIN IN THE FIFTH GRADE WANT TO THE SIX GRADE HIGHER MISS LAWS IN THE SIXTH GRADE I. HATED BUT I LOVED IT WHEN I LOOK BACK AT IT WAS THE BEST THING TO THEIR YEAR I MOVED UP SO DID SHE- AND I HAD THREE YEARS OF HER IMPACT IN MY LIFE CLASSMATES ON THE RICH HISTORY OF OUR CONTRIBUTIONS IN THIS COUNTRY AND I PROBABLY WOULD NAY AT IT ANY OTHER WAY. AND AGAIN MY MOTHER WENT TO H. B. C. USE COLLEGE. AND SHE INSTILLED AS WELL AS MY FALL IN IMPORTS OF NO ONE OUR HISTORY BUT AGAIN. OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM DOES NOT PREPARE US TO KNOW THE REAL TRUTH THE REAL HISTORY. THIS COURSE WILL ALLOW. A LEASE ENTREE A LITTLE BETTER UNDERSTANDING FOR EACH AND EVERYONE OF US.

THE PRESIDENT THANK YOU SO MUCH COLLEAGUES I WILL ASK FOR THE COURTESY OF JUST A MOMENT TO MAKE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS. WHAT AN INCREDIBLY POWERFUL WEEK THIS HAS BEEN FOR OUR STATE AND OUR NATION. WE MET ARE DEADLINE PASSED A RESPONSIBLE BUDGET THAT IS FAITHFUL TO OUR LEGISLATIVE BUDGET PRIORITIES CLOSES THE FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR GAP. AND PROTECTS CORE PROGRAMS AND RESOURCES FOR CALIFORNIANS. THIS WOULD BE AN ACCOMPLISHMENT WORTHY OF PRAISE IN ANY YEAR. BUT IS THAT MUCH MORE AMAZING WHEN VIEWED THROUGH THE LENS OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC AND THE ECONOMIC FALLOUT AND CHALLENGES THAT HAVE FOLLOWED. BUDGET CONVERSATIONS WITH GOVERNOR NEWSOME ARE PROGRESSING. AND WE ARE WORKING ON FINE TUNING OUR PROPOSAL TO BEST MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL WHO LIVE HERE. AND WHILE WE WORK ON BUDGETS POLICY AND LEGISLATION THE SUPREME COURT WAS WORKING TO PROTECT SAFEGUARDS FOR THE LGBT Q. WORKERS AND FOR IMMIGRANTS. ON MONDAY WE WOKE TO THE NEWS THAT THE JUSTICES HAD DECIDED THAT TITLE SEVEN OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT BARRING SEX DISCRIMINATION IN THE WORKPLACE ALSO PROTECTS THE LGBT Q. WORKERS. FROM BEING FIRED ON THE BASIS OF THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR GENDER IDENTITY. ONE OF THE FIRST LAWS I WROTE AS A MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY CLARIFY THE DEFINITION OF GENDER IN CERTAIN ANTI DISCRIMINATION LAWS. SO THAT IS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS FOR CALIFORNIA'S LGBT Q. WORKERS. NOW THE SUPREME COURT'S RULING AFFIRMS THAT PROTECTION THROUGHOUT OUR NATION. WHAT A WELCOME WHEN TO CELEBRATE DURING PRIDE MONTH. THAT SAME DAY THE COURT REJECTED THE ADMINISTRATION'S CHALLENGE OF THE CALIFORNIA VALUES ACT WHICH PREVENTS STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM SHARING IMMIGRANTS PERSONAL INFORMATION. WITH FEDERAL IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES AND TRANSFERRING THEM TO IMMIGRATION CUSTODY. WHEN IMMIGRANTS ARE AFRAID TO SPEAK UP IN REPORT CRIMES NONE OF US ARE SAFE. SB FIFTY FOUR AUTHORED BY MY PREDECESSOR AND OUR FORMER COLLEAGUE KEVIN DE LEON WAS AND CONTINUES TO BE CRITICAL FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AND OUR STATE. AND TODAY WE CAN CELEBRATE ANOTHER VICTORY THE SUPREME COURT'S UPHOLDING OF THE DEFERRED ACTION FOR CHILDHOOD ARRIVALS OR DACA PROGRAM. THE DECISION IS A DESERVED TO WIN BOTH FOR DREAMERS OUR STATE AND THE ENTIRE NATION. WE'VE BEEN ESTIMATED HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND DACA RECIPIENTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND NOW THEY CAN CONTINUE TO GO TO SCHOOL AND WORK WITHOUT FEAR OF DEPORTATION. THIS WEEK IS A WIN FOR EQUALITY AND IMMIGRANT RIGHTS AND TRULY FEELS LIKE JUSTICE AND THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE HAVE PREVAILED. WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO. AND JUST A MINUTE AGO. THE SENATOR FROM GUARDINO SUCCESSFULLY MOVED AB. FOURTEEN SIXTY MAKING CALIFORNIA THE FIRST IN THE NATION TO REQUIRE ETHNIC STUDIES AS A GRADUATION REQUIREMENT. COLLEAGUES I ASK THAT WE ADJOURN WITH THESE VICTORIES TOP OF MIND CAN CARRY THAT SPIRIT OF COMMITMENT AND COURAGE THAT HELP THEM SUCCEED. INTO OUR WORK IN THE COMING WEEKS WE WILL NEED IT BUT I KNOW WE ARE UP FOR THE CHALLENGE. COLLEAGUES THANK YOU SO MUCH WE WILL ADJOURN UNTIL MONDAY. JUNE TWENTY SECOND AT ONE PM THANK YOU. MEMBERS THE SENATE WILL BE IN RECESS UNTIL THREE THIRTY PM AT WHICH TIME THE ADJOURNMENT MOTION WILL BE MADE WE WILL RECONVENE MONDAY AT ONE PM HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND.
