HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. TODAY IS TUESDAY MARCH FOURTEENTH AND WE ARE NOW IN THE PM. WOULD THE PANELISTS FOR ISSUE NUMBER TEN PLEASE STEP FORWARD YOU MAY BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. GREAT SO GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER CAN'T DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES -- SO. FOR ISSUE TEN WE'RE SEEKING -- AUGMENTATION AND REAPPROPRIATION OF FUNDING THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED BY THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR -- CAME THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT -- INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM THAT WE OPERATE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES ADMINISTERS -- ARE FEE FOR SERVICE -- CHECK RIGHT -- ON A WEEKLY BASIS AND SO THERE'S A EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF COMPLEXITY IN THAT SYSTEM IN TERMS OF THE INPUTS COMING IN FROM PROVIDERS BILLING US FOR CLAIMS AS WELL AS US PUTTING OUT. CHECKS WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF MODERNIZING THAT ANTIQUATED SYSTEM AND SO THERE ARE TWO REQUESTS IN FRONT OF THE LEGISLATURE -- FOR PURPOSES OF THE MAY REVISION AND THAT WE ARE SEEKING -- REAPPROPRIATION LANGUAGE FOR FUNDS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN EXPENDED -- IN THE CURRENT YEAR BUT WILL BE NEEDED IN THE BUDGET YEAR AS WELL AS AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR A TOTAL OF FORTY SEVEN POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS -- FOR OUR TURNOVER AND TAKE OVER COSTS SO WE DID A PROCUREMENT -- MAYBE ABOUT A YEAR AGO AND WE SPLIT THE CONTRACT BETWEEN AN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS VENDOR AS WELL AS A BUSINESS OPERATIONS UNDER THE TURNOVER AND TAKE OVER FROM OUR PREVIOUS VENDOR INTO THOSE TWO NEW CONTRACTS WITH TWO NEW VENDORS. IS SOME OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AS WELL AS THERE ARE POSITIONS IN THIS REQUEST -- FOR WHAT WE WOULD CALL -- OVERSIGHT TO OWNERSHIP -- SO AS PART OF STATE -- TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS WHAT WE ARE TRYING VERY MUCH TO DO IS TO CREATE BOTH THE EXPERTISE THE KNOWLEDGE. AND THE CAPACITY WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT -- TO BOTH MONITOR AND ADMINISTER -- SIGNIFICANT IT PROJECTS RATHER THAN RELYING ON VENDOR SOLELY TO DO THAT ON OUR BEHALF AND SO SOME OF THE POSITIONS THAT ARE IN FRONT OF YOU FOR THE MAY REVISION ARE -- DEDICATED TO CONTINUING THAT EFFORT TO DO THAT -- PARTICULAR STAFF EXPERTISE AND CAPACITY BUILDING. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. BROWN WAS THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE ARE REVIEWING THISPROPOSAL AND HAD SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT -- THE INCREASE IN THE COST RELATIVE TO AND THE LAST PCP HERE IN. AND THESE QUESTIONS ARE ARE REFLECTED IN THE AGENDA -- AND AND ARE ARE WAITING FOR A RESPONSE FROM THE DEPARTMENT ON THOSE ISSUES. NEXT WITNESS. UP CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WE BELIEVE THE MODERNIZING CAMPUS IS A PRUDENT MEASURE BY THE DEPARTMENT AND WE CAN DEFER TO THE DEPARTMENT ON THOUGH IS QUESTIONS. AND I THINK WE'RE WORKING ON FURTHER MORE DETAILED WRITTEN ANSWERS TO ELLIE -- BECAUSE THEY HAVE CERTAINLY ASKED FOR QUESTIONS. LET'S OPEN IT UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT. SEEING NONE I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THAT PRESENTATION THAT CONCLUDES. ISSUE NUMBER TÃ¢M. WE WILL TAKE NO ACTION AT THIS TIME TO ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL DEBATE AND DISCUSSION ISSUE. ELEVEN YES SO THIS IS -- A BUDGET -- STAFFING REQUEST I'M SPECIFICALLY IN OUR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER COMPLIANCE DIVISION FOR SEVEN PERMANENT POSITIONS AND EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY OF APPROXIMATELY MILLION DOLLARS. FROM OUR LICENSING FUND -- THIS IS A COMBINATION I REQUEST FOR MULTIPLE WORKLOADS WITH IN THAT DIVISION SO -- AS PART OF ANY KIND OF EMERGENCY DECLARATION SO LAST YEAR FOR THE WOLSELEY FIRES -- FOR EXAMPLE -- WE HAVE STAFF THAT WERE CALLING HUNDREDS OF FACILITIES DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT HAD EITHER BEEN EVACUATED OR HAD -- BEEN LOST TO THE FIRE BECAUSE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN EVACUATEDWHAT THEIR STATUS IS IF THEY HAVE OPEN BEDS. SO SOME OF THE STAFF ARE FOR THAT KIND OF UNFORTUNATELY FOR THAT KIND OF CONTINUING ONGOING WORKLOAD. AS WELL AS THERE ARE STAFF IN HERE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE OPIOID -- CURES ACT GRANT FUNDS THIS IS THE DIVISION THAT IS HANDLING THAT PARTICULAR AREA -- OF THE DEPARTMENTS EFFORT -- TO ADMINISTER THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WITH APPROXIMATELY -- THIRTY DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROJECTS AND THEN LASTLY -- WE CONTINUE TO HAVE FACILITIES THAT COME IN -- SEEKING LICENSURE AS A RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITY AND SO SOME STAFFER NEEDED TO HELP ON BOTH ADDRESS THAT ONGOING WORKLOAD AS WELL AS I'M TRY TO ADDRESS THE BACKLOG AND IN RESIDENTIAL APPLICATIONS. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. JOHNSON DAILY -- WE HAVE NO CONCERNS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS ANON CONTENT OF FINANCE NO COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU WHAT'S UP UP UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT. HI SIR IT IS THE CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM OF ADDICTION PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONALS I GUESS I HAVE MORE QUESTIONS THAN COMMONS -- THE ITEM IS KIND OF VAGUE AS TO WHERE THE MONEY'S BEING APPLIED -- TO INCLUDES COUNSELORS -- BIZ BROADLY AND THEN ANTI P. REGULATION AND THEN SOME EMERGENCY DISASTER AND WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT ALLOCATION IS GOING TO WHICH DIRECTION WE'D LIKE TO KNOW MORE DETAIL ON THAT. AS FAR AS THE EMERGENCY AND DISASTER RESPONSE WE FEEL LIKE -- THE AMOUNT IS OVER INFLATED BECAUSE AS MENTIONED IN THE ANALYSIS AND HE PIECE ALREADY HAVE DISASTER RESPONSE. REQUIREMENTS ANY HOME A RESIDENTIAL FACILITY THAT'S UNDER SIX BEDS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT EVACUATING AND FINDING A PLACEMENT FOR SIX PEOPLE IN AND MOVING STAFF AROUND. MANY OF THE SMALLER PROGRAMS OWN MORE THAN ONE FACILITY. OUR BOARD MEMBER WHO OWNS THE PROGRAM UP AND SHE GO HAD THIS EXACT THING HAPPENED TO HER. PROGRAM THIS PAST FALL AND SHE WAS EASILY ABLE TO RELOCATE THE PEOPLE IN HER SIX BEDS THE ONES THAT ARE OVER SIXPENCE THE LARGER FACILITIES ARE REQUIRED BY THEIR LOCAL. THERE ARE LOCAL AS ZONING CODES TO HAVE EVACUATION PLANS -- WE'RE NOT SURE HOW THE NTP PART OF IT IS. IS ARE BEING DISTRIBUTED THERE ARE LICENSING FUNDS THAT ARE COLLECTED FOR THAT PURPOSE -- THE NEXT I DIDN'T START WITH I'M ASSUMING THAT THE MONEY'S BEING ALLOCATED ALREADY IN THE FUND. AS OPPOSED TO AN INCREASE IN LICENSING FEES AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A CORRECT ASSUMPTION OR NOT BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT HAS -- INFORMATION INFORMATION NOTICE A THIRTY TO INCREASE FEES IF THEY NEED TO SHOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. MONEY THIS ALREADY BEEN COLLECTED AS OPPOSED TO RAISING FEES. AND I IT JUST ONE POINT OUT THAT IN -- TWENTY FOURTEEN WE HAD AN INCREASE IN FEES OF ONE HUNDRED AND 10%. ON RESIDENTIAL. FOR A A DEFICIT OF EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE ROTH FUND. AND THE ASK WAS FOR TWO POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS. AT THE TIME WE COMPLAINED VOCIFEROUSLY THAT. THAT WAS TOO HIGH OF A RECENT FEES GIVEN THE DEFICIT. AND IF WE'RE NOT WORKING OUT. OVER A MILLION DOLLARS NOT FUND THAT'S NEEDING A HOME. PERHAPS WE WERE RIGHT ABOUT THE FEES BEING TOO HIGH. WE ARE ONE OF THE ONLY STATES THAT HAS A PER BED LICENSING FEE. THIS CONSTRUCT ACCESS TO CARE BECAUSE EVEN IN YOUR SMALLER NONPROFIT SOCIAL MODELS THEY'RE MAKING DETERMINATIONS ON HOW MANY BEDS TO LICENSE. BASED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLAR FEE PER BED. SO IF THIS IS A TRULY. TRYING TO FIND A HOME WE WOULD PREFER THAT SOME ANALYSIS BE DONE OF THE LICENSING. OF FUN AND IF IT TRULY IS RUNNING AND NOT HIGH OF IN THE BLACK. WE WOULD CERTAINLY LIKE TO SEE AT LEAST FOR THE NON PROFITS THE SMALLER WORLD PROGRAMS TO HAVE A REDUCTION IN THEIR BED FEE. OTHER STATES ARE ONLY FIVE THAT CHARGE BED FEES AND THEY RANGE FROM FIVE TO FIFTY DOLLARS OUR SYSTEM HUNDRED AND FIFTY SO I THINK SOME ANALYSIS. OF THAT FUND NEEDS TO BE DONE WE WERE PROMISED THAT WHEN THE FEE INCREASE WENT THROUGH AND WE'D LIKE TO SEE IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE I PROTESTED MINISTRATION TO RESPOND. TO THE COMMENTS TO THAT PUBLIC COMMENT. SURE SO I WILL HAVE TO GO -- BACK FROM A STANDPOINT OF UNDERSTANDING THE FUNDS -- STEP -- THE LEVEL OF THE FUND AMOUNTS -- AND HOW THAT PERTAINS -- TO THAT THE RELATIONSHIP FOR THE ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS AN APPROPRIATION A SORTIE I DO KNOW THAT WITH SPECIAL FUNDS AND WITH LICENSE SCENE YOU KNOW WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THAT -- WE DON'T -- EXPEND FUNDS ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN THE ACCOUNT ITSELF I KNOW THAT -- WE SAW LICENSURE -- INCREASES TO RIGHT SIZE THE LICENSING FUND -- AS REFERENCE BEFORE IN THAT WE HAD EXTRAORDINARY -- AN UP SURGEON APPLICATIONS AFTER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS ENACTED IN THAT OUT BECAUSE THERE'S NOW A BENEFIT FOR SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT A LOT OF FACILITIES WERE LOOKING TO COME INTO -- INTO BOTH THE STATE AS WELL AS INTO HEALTH PLAN NETWORKS TO HELP PROVIDE THAT SERVICE AND SO OUR APPLICATIONS AND THE AMOUNT OF LICENSURE ACTIVITY RELATED TO THAT. CERTAINLY NEEDED A RIGHT SIZING IN THE FUN BUT I CAN GET YOU -- I FUND STATUS -- AND TALK TO MY STAFF ABOUT -- SOME OF THE MORE. CONCRETE DETAILS THAT WERE JUST WHAT WERE JUST MENTION THANK YOU. ANY OF THE PUBLIC COMMENT. SPRING IT BACK TO THE MEMBERS QUESTIONS COMMENTS. EARLIER TODAY OUR FIRST -- THE FIRST ITEM HAS TO DO WITH DISASTER MEDICAL SERVICES BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS. AND THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT HAVE TO DO WITH DISASTER PREPAREDNESS. EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT CONCERNED THAT HAS BEEN VOICED. OVER AND OVER IS HOW WE WORK IN SILOS -- WE GO BACK TO THE HOMELESS ISSUE. THAT THERE'S MONEY GOING TO SO MANY DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS SOMEONE SOMEBODY NEEDS TO HAVE ACCESS TO THAT. THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW WHICH DEPARTMENT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO GO -- TO BUT DIFFERENT APARTMENTS HAVE SOME DISASTER PREPAREDNESS MONEY -- THAT THEY HAVE TRAINING FOR OR THAT THEY HAVE MONEY FOR SERVICES FOR A MEDICAL SERVICES FOR MENTAL SERVICES. AND YET THEY'RE SILO ROAD IN SO MANY WAYS THAT IN THE END YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THE PROPER. ENTRY POINT IS -- THAT IS A CONCERN AND I I KNOW FROM THE LA OWES -- CONCERNS THAT WERE NOTED IN IN. THE DOCUMENT -- THERE WAS THAT CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST BREAKDOWN. OF WHAT THE NEW STATE RESPONSIBILITIES. ARE -- IF THE IF YOU'VE TALKED TO GENERALLY ABOUT THE NEW RESPONSIBILITIES IS THERE ANYTHING MORE SPECIFIC. YOU CAN PROVIDE TO US ABOUT. THE NEW RESPONSIBILITIES. YOU'VE GIVEN THE FOR AREAS BUT SURE SO -- WITHIN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY EACH OF US -- SO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES -- DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AM SO AWESOME HEAD WHEN THERE IS A NATURAL DISASTER DEPENDING ON WHAT THAT IS BE IT. FIRE FLOOD -- EARTHQUAKE -- THERE IS A COORDINATED EFFORT AT THE AGENCY LEVEL USUALLY IN CONCERT WITH -- HELLO YES IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW ACTIVATION OF THE STATE EMERGENCY COMMAND CENTER AND SO -- HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY HAS FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS BEEN FAR MORE AND AGGRESSIVE ABOUT HAVING THE DEPARTMENTS A LEAN I GUESS LEAN INTO THEIR LICENSED -- FACILITIES AND PROVIDER TYPES WHEN A DISASTER OCCURS IN A GIVEN SERVICE AREA SUCH THAT WE ARE DOING. CALLS TO FACILITIES WERE DOING HEAT MAPPING -- SO THAT WITHIN THE AGENCY AS WELL AS A COW -- YES THEY HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF THE IMPACT OF THAT DISASTER IN THOSE SERVICE AREAS SO THAT HAS TURNED OUT TO BE A SIGNIFICANT -- STAFF INTENSIVE EXERCISE WE WILL HAVE STAFF ON THE PHONE IN IN IN LIKE IN THE IN THE WOLSELEY FIRE DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THERE'S AN EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER. OF RESIDENTIAL AND OUTPATIENT SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT FACILITIES SO THAT WAS A PARTICULARLY HIGH WORKLOAD IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA. BUT OBVIOUSLY -- THERE HAS BEEN A LOT MORE -- INTEREST AT BOTH KALLIO CAL -- YES AS WELL AS HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND. HOW WE ARE COMMUNICATING WITH THE LOCALS AS WELL AS UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENT PROVIDER TYPES -- WHEN IT COMES TO THE FEDERAL CURES ACT FUNDING -- THIS PARTICULAR DIVISION HAS ESSENTIALLY -- ABSORBED THE THE SIGNIFICANT INFLUX OF FEDERAL DOLLARS WE HAVE I THINK APPROXIMATELY THIRTY DIFFERENT PROJECTS THAT ARE UNDER WAY AND SO. THESE INDIVIDUALS THROUGH THIS -- B. C. P. WOULD JUST BE HELPING TO KIND OF SUPPORT THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN DOING THAT -- THERE'S A LOT OF GRANT DOLLARS AN OVERSIGHT AND CONTRACT MANAGEMENT THAT HAS BEEN DONE AS A PART OF THAT SO. THIS -- THE SEVEN POSITIONS WERE REALLY MEANT. TO YOU KNOW HANDLE THE KIND OF TEMPORARY NATURE OF DISASTER MANAGEMENT WORK ON THE FEDERAL CURES ACT AS WELL AS JUST -- DEAL WITH THE CONSTANT -- INFLOW OF APPLICATIONS FROM NEW PROVIDERS OR THE WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH -- CONTINUAL WE HAVE TO RECERTIFY THOSE -- FACILITIES ON A I THINK A THREE YEAR BASIS SO IF YOU'VE BEEN LICENSE AS A RESIDENTIAL FACILITY WE GO BACK OUT WE INSPECT YOU WE MAKE SURE THAT EVERY THING IS STILL -- UP TO DATE ON YOUR LICENSE AND OR IF THERE'S A COMPLAINT SO THERE'S JUST A LOT OF WORKLOAD THAT THIS PARTICULAR DIVISION HAS. VERY GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH THAT CONCLUDES ISSUE NUMBER. TEN I'M SORRY ISSUE [inaudible] ELEVEN AND ISSUE NUMBER. TWELVE YES THANK YOU SO -- WE'RE REQUESTING THE CONVERSION OF THIRTEEN LIMITED TERM -- POSITIONS AS WELL AS A TWO YEAR EXTENSION OF SEVEN POSITIONS -- THESE ARE POSITIONS -- SPLIT BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT DIVISIONS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT -- OUR ENTERPRISE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES DIVISION AS WELL AS IN OUR ELIGIBILITY DIVISION. WHEN -- THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS PASSED WE CREATED -- A SHARED IT SYSTEM BETWEEN US AND COVER CALIFORNIA KNOWN AS CAL HERE'S THAT SYSTEM -- CONNECTS THROUGH A WE CALL IT THE HIT ME AND I COULDN'T TELL YOU WHAT THAT ACTUALLY STANDS FOR BUT IT TALKS ESSENTIALLY TO THE THREE COUNTY CONSORTIUM SYSTEMS. THE STAFF THAT BOTH MAINTAIN OUR EXISTING SYSTEMS WITHIN OUR OWN DEPARTMENTS ENTERPRISE AS WELL AS WORKING WITH THE CAL HERE'S PROJECT AND AS WELL AS WORKING WITH THE COUNTY SAUCE CONSORTIUM. WE'RE SO WE KNOW THAT THAT WORKLOAD -- IS CONTINUING -- FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT WE CONTINUE TO BOTH MAINTAIN AND MODIFY AND UPDATE THE SYSTEM AS CHANGES ARISE YOU KNOW. WITH RECENT EXAMPLE ABOUT THE EXPANSION OF COVERAGE TO INDIVIDUALS UP TO AGE TWENTY SIX IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE WHERE WE WOULD BE MAKING CHANGES TO CAL HERE'S AND TESTING. WITH THE SAUCE SYSTEM AND SO -- THESE ARE REALLY KIND OF KEEPING THOSE CRITICAL RESOURCES IN PLACE FROM OUR DEPARTMENT STANDPOINT. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. LAURIE I'VE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. WILL THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WERE STILL REVIEWING THIS BUT DON'T HAVE ANY MAJOR CONCERNS AT THIS TIME THANK YOU [inaudible] PUBLIC COMMENT. SEEING NONE BRING IT BACK TO THE WEDDING QUESTIONS COMMENTS VERY GOOD. THAT CONCLUDES ISSUE NUMBER TWELVE ISSUE. THIRTEEN SO THIS IS THE LAST ITEM FOR OUR DEPARTMENT AND AS YOU HEARD IN -- PREVIOUS -- COMMITTEE WE ARE SEEKING BOTH RESOURCES AS WELL AS TRAILER BILL AUTHORITY TO AFFECTION WAIT. SOME OF OUR RECENT DEPARTMENT CHANGES AROUND OVERSIGHT OF THE MANAGED CARE PLANS AS IT ADULT. COURSE THAT MEASURES -- WE HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT PLANS ARE NOT MEETING THEIR MINIMUM PERFORMANCE LEVEL THAT WE WOULD BE PUTTING THEM UNDER IMMEDIATE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN. PLACING THEM UNDER SANCTION WE HAD A COUPLE OF OTHER INSTANCES IN WHICH WE FEEL THAT WE NEED MORE AND CONSISTENT SANCTION AUTHORITY ACROSS ALL OF OUR DIFFERENT -- DELIVERY SYSTEMS AS WELL AS OUR DIFFERENT PROVIDER TYPES AND SO WE'RE SEEKING STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO UPDATE THAT AS WELL AS TO UPDATE THE SANCTION AMOUNTS CONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL ALLOWABLE AMOUNTS -- AND THEN LASTLY TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH OUR EXISTING AND EXTERNAL QUALITY REVIEW ORGANIZATION AND HAVE THAT -- PROCESS BE EXEMPT FROM DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES REVIEW WHICH IS -- CONSISTENT WITH HOW WE HAVE MOST OF OUR CONTRACT APPROVALS AND IT'S REALLY JUST A CONTRACT EXTENSION FOR WORK THAT THEY'RE ALREADY DOING BUT WE ARE. CHANGING AND MODIFYING THE CONTRACT TO DO ADDITIONAL WORK ON OUR BEHALF TO EFFECTUATE THE CHANGES THAT WERE ANNOUNCED -- WITH THE WITH THE RECENT AUDIT AS IT PERTAINED TO CHILDREN'S PREVENTIVE MEASURES. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE -- BEN JOHNSON WITH THE LA -- BUT WE DO THINK INCREASED OVERSIGHT OF MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS IS BOTH A PROMISING IN PRUDENT APPROACH TO INCREASING QUALITY IN THE PROGRAM -- WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE TRAILER BILL YET BUT WILL REVIEW IT IN THE COMING DAYS AND WILL PROVIDE ANY ASSESSMENTS ESPECIALLY IF WE HAVE ANY CONCERNS BUT LOOK FORWARD TO IT IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS. THANK YOU. I'M THE FINANCE JUST BECAUSE I GUESS DEPARTMENT FINANCE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE AND NOTING THAT THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WILL BE POSTED TO OUR WEBSITE SOON. VERY GOOD THANK YOU -- LET'S OPEN IT UP TO THE PUBLIC. BETH CAPELL HEALTHAXIS CALIFORNIA WE ARE VERY LOOKING FORWARD VERY MUCH TO SING THE TRAILER BILL ON THIS WE WANT THE DEPARTMENT HAVE AMPLE AUTHORITY TO OVERSEE NOT ONLY THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS. BUT THEIR SUBCONTRACTORS AND NOT ONLY WITH RESPECT TO CHILD PREVENTIVE SERVICES TO BUT TO THE BROAD RANGE OF SERVICES WHICH MEDI CAL COVERS WE WERE VERY TROUBLED RECENTLY TO SEE THE FAILURE OF A US SUBCONTRACTORS CENTER BAD -- WHICH WAS A SUBCONTRACTOR WITH MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS THAT WAS DENYING ACCESS TO SPECIALISTS SUCH AS CARDIOLOGISTS POLL MONOLOGIST RADIOLOGIST OPHTHALMOLOGIST IN A LONG LIST OF OTHER SPECIALS THAT ARE BASIC. TO PEOPLE'S NEEDED CARE AND SO WE WANT THE DEPARTMENT TO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE GET THE CARE THEY NEED WHETHER CHILDREN GETTING PREVENTIVE SERVICES. FOR THE REST OF US GETTING THE CARE THEY NEED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- ALIGNER COMMENTS WITH HEALTH ACCESS WE TO OF LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE -- GREATER CONSIDERING OVER 80% OF MEDI CAL AND RALLIES ARE IN MANAGED CARE PLAN GREATER OVERSIGHT AND TRANSPARENCY OF THE PLANS AS WELL AS THEIR DELEGATED ENTITIES IS NEEDED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. QUESTIONS VERY GOOD THANK YOU THAT CONCLUDES ISSUE NUMBER. THIRTEEN ISSUE NUMBER FOURTEEN PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SUBJECT LAB IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M HERE TO BRIEF THE PROPOSED THE ADMINISTRATION'S. UP PRESENT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL ON THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE AND STATE SUBSIDY PROGRAM. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE MAYOR VISION PROPOSES TO OFFER STATE SUBSIDIES TO INDIVIDUALS. BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND 6100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. IT CONTINUES THE INTENT OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO MAINTAIN A BUDGET NEUTRAL POT PROGRAM OVER THE FORECAST PERIOD SO IS PROPOSING. TO FUNDED THE INCREASE OF THE PROGRAM WITH THE PENALTY REVENUE GENERATED BY THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE -- COMPARED TO INITIAL ESTIMATE SURE AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PENALTY REVENUE PROJECTIONS ARE DOWN BY APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED MILLION OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD. SO I GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WAS ROUGHLY ONE POINT FIVE BILLION SB REVISION WE BELIEVE IT'S A ROUGHLY. ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS AS NO BEEN FOR THIS ESTIMATE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT CALIFORNIA'S HIGHER FILING TAX THRESHOLD WHICH MEANS FEWER INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE PENALTY. UP BEYOND THAT WE TOOK THE TWENTY SIXTEEN FEDERAL DATA GREW IT BY PROJECTION ASSUMING THAT MORE INDIVIDUALS WOULD. NO LONGER BE COVERED BY INSURANCE BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF THE FEDERAL PENALTY. FOR THIS TAX YEAR AND FROM THERE WE DISCOUNTED BY THE INCREASE CALIFORNIA FILING THRESHOLD -- SO AS A RESULT OF THE CHANGE IN THE PENALTY REVENUE WE'RE PROPOSING PROGRAM EXPENSES OF TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE POINT THREE MILLION IN. NINETEEN TWENTY THREE HUNDRED THIRTY POINT FOUR MILLION IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE POINT NINE MILLION IN. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO UP FOR COVERAGE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY BASED ON ESTIMATES PROVIDED BY COVER CALIFORNIA WE BELIEVE THE PROGRAM WILL RESULT IN APPROXIMATELY EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING STATE SUBSIDIES. THROUGH THE EXCHANGE RESULTING AND A HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND NEWLY INSURED. INDIVIDUALS. SO ON TO YOUR QUESTIONS WHY ARE WE PROPOSING THE SONS TO SUNSET THE SUBSIDIES BUT NOT THE MANDATE. AS PREVIOUSLY REFERENCED IN OUR TESTIMONY ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL WE BELIEVE THAT THIS SUNSET WILL GIVE US TIME TO RE EVALUATE THE MERITS OF THE PROPOSAL THE PROGRAM. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT. ADDRESSING THE AFFORDABILITY. OF COMPONENTS OF THIS PROPOSAL WILL REQUIRES STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP. AND BUILDING IN THE SUNSET TIME WILL ALLOW US TO REASSESS. AT THAT TIME ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE ANOTHER PROPOSAL. TO CREATE THE HEALTHY CALIFORNIA FOR ALL COMMISSION WHICH WILL BE ANALYZING DIFFERENT SINGLE PAYER PROPOSALS. THAT WILL HOPEFULLY RELEASED THE REPORT IN THE NEXT YEAR AND A HALF. AT WHICH TIME WE WILL BE ABLE TO USE THAT DATA TO REASSESS THIS PROGRAM. OF ON YOUR SECOND OR THIRD QUESTION COULD HOUSEHOLDS CLOSE A LARGE RECONCILIATION -- YES OR PROPOSAL INCLUDES RECONCILIATION -- OF THE INDIVIDUAL STEPS IN BOUNCE AND INDIVIDUAL PENALTY PAYMENTS -- WE THINK THAT RECONCILIATION IS NECESSARY BECAUSE WE HAVE A PROGRAM THAT EXCEEDS THE FEDERAL. OF PROGRAM THAT'S CURRENTLY IN PLACE THAT IT STOPS OFFERING FIDDLES IS ASSISTANCE AT FOUR HUDRED F. P. L.. IF WE DON'T MAINTAIN THE RECONCILIATION COMPONENT OF OUR PROPOSAL THERE COULD BE INSTANCES WHERE INDIVIDUALS ARE JUST ABOVE OR JUST BELOW THAT. THRESHOLD AND RECEIVING BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE ASSISTANCE WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD PREFER TO AVOID. AND THEN DOES THIS PROPOSAL MAKE A MEANINGFUL FED FOR INDIVIDUALS BELOW FOR HER PERCENT F. PEEL BASED OFF THE MODELING THAT COVER CALIFORNIA HAS PROVIDED. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD RESULT AND A HUNDRED THOUSAND APPROXIMATELY NEW INDIVIDUALS AND ROLLED. IN INSURANCE BELOW THE HOLE OF FURTHER COVER CALIFORNIA ESTIMATES THAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD REDUCE PREMIUM GROWTH BY. UP 28% -- IN COVER YOUR TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN FINALLY HOW RAPIDLY DUE OUT YOUR COSTS GROW. IF WE DO NOT MODIFY THE PROGRAM DESIGNED IN THE OUT YEARS. SO WORKING WITH COVER CALIFORNIA WE IDENTIFIED TWO PRIMARY FACTORS THAT RESULTS IN SIGNIFICANT OUT YOUR COST GROWTH IS YOUR PREMIUM GROWTH AND THEN THE GROWTH OF PERSONAL INCOME IF THE GROWTH OF PERSONAL INCOME DOES NOT KEEP. PACE WITH THE COST OF PREMIUMS. THE STATE SHARE OF COST FOR INDIVIDUALS PREMIUM INCREASES RAPIDLY. SO BASED OFF THE MALL THAT WE HAVE PROPOSED TODAY ROUGHLY IF WE MAINTAIN THIS MODEL IN YOUR ONE YEAR TWO AND YEAR -- THREE WE BELIEVE THAT THE COST FOR INDIVIDUALS ABOVE FOUR HUNDRED F. P. L. COULD GROW BY UP 230% IN YOUR ONE AND THEN ANOTHER 30% IN YOUR TWO RESULTING IN ADDITIONAL COSTS OF RANGING BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION -- FOR THOSE TWO ADDITIONAL YEARS -- WE LIKE TO NOTE THAT OUR INTENT IN DESIGNING THIS PROGRAM IS TO MAINTAIN AN AVERAGE SUBSIDY AMOUNT ABOVE FOR THE INDIVIDUALS ABOVE FOUR HUNDRED F. P. L. OF ABOUT A HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH. AND MAINTAIN THAT AVERAGE MONTHLY SUBSIDY FOR INDIVIDUALS BELOW FOUR HUNDRED A MONTH AT ABOUT TEN DOLLARS. AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR GOING STRAIGHT TO THE QUESTIONS ALSO APPRECIATE THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE TO ASK. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. BROWN WAS THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- LIKE ALL OF THE OTHER PROPOSALS IN THE MAYOR VISION OUR OFFICE CONTINUES TO EVALUATE THESE AS AS ADDITIONAL DETAIL IS IS COMING OUT WERE REVIEWING THIS SPECIFIC BENEFIT PARAMETERS THAT WERE JUST. DESCRIBED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- IN TERMS OF SPECIFIC COMMENTS THAT WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THEM AT THIS POINT I'M JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT -- AS WITH -- OTHER. AT PROPOSES IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THIS INVOLVES A SUNSET. AND IT HAS SOME OF THE SAME ISSUES THAT WE'VE DESCRIBED RIVAS LEE ABOUT -- POTENTIAL COST PRESSURES IN THE OUT YEARS IN THE BUDGET -- WHERE IT T MAY BE DIFFICULT TO TO END THIS BENEFIT -- EVEN THOUGH THE THE THE MULTI YEAR AND HIS BALANCED ON THE PREMISE THAT. THIS BENEFIT WOULD BE SUNSET -- SO THAT'S SOMETHING FOR IT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER -- BEYOND THAT AND THE LEGISLATURE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS -- WHETHER THE ALLOCATION OF THE PENALTY REVENUES TO INDIVIDUALS ABOVE 4100% OF F. P. L. WHO CURRENTLY RECEIVE NO ASSISTANCE. VERSES INDIVIDUALS BELOW 4100% OF F. P. L. WHO DO RECEIVE FEDERAL ASSISTANCE IS CONSISTENT WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. THE GOVERNOR HAS. PROPOSED TO SPEND THE MAJORITY THE REVENUES FOR THOSE THAT ARE CURRENTLY ON SUBSIDIZED. AND THAT HAS POLICY MERITS IN THAT DOWN THOSE INDIVIDUALS -- CURRENTLY HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST COSTS. BUT AS A SIDE RESULT AM VERY LITTLE IS IS LEFT FOR THE THE GROUP THAT'S BELOW SO THAT'S SOMETHING FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER AS WELL -- BEYOND THAT WILL ADD UP. UPDATE THE LEGISLATURE WITH ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS THAT WE HAVE THANK YOU. IN CHAIR KATIE RAVEL DIRECTOR OF POLICY AND RESEARCH IT COVER CALIFORNIA DON'T HAVE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS BUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. THANK YOU. LET'S OPEN IT UP TO PUBLIC. FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. BEST PAL IN BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA. LIKE TO START OFF BY SAYING THAT WE APPRECIATED THE ADMINISTRATION HAS APPROACH PROPOSED ADDITIONAL AFFORDABILITY HELP. BUT WE ARE UNHAPPY THAT IT IS LIMITED TO THE REVENUE RAISED BY THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. WE DO THINGS OF THE HELP IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE PEOPLE THE FEDERAL SUBSIDY. A MARRIED COUPLE IN THEIR LATE FIFTIES OR EARLY SIXTIES WHO WANTED TO BUY THE STANDARD SILVER PLAN COULD SPEND AS MUCH AS 40% OF THEIR INCOME. ON THE PREMIUM ALONE AND OBVIOUSLY FAMILIES IN THAT SITUATION MAKE DIFFICULT CHOICES AND SOMETIMES BY THE SKINNIER PLAN WITH THE SIX THOUSAND DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE FOR EACH OF THEM OR ONE OF THEM THE ONE THEY HOPE IS HEALTHY GOES WITHOUT COVERAGE IN HOPES THEY CAN MAKE IT TO MEDICARE. SO WE DO APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S HELP FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE 410026100% OF POVERTY. BUT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE GOVERNOR IS NOT WILLING TO HELP PEOPLE WHO MAKE LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE AND I'M SORRY I CAN'T HAVE A CHOICE BETWEEN SEEING MY PAPER AND SEEING YOU MISTER MATHESON IT'S JUST -- SO WE'RE LOOKING AT SOMEBODY UNDER THE CURRENT FEDERAL LAW. WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN COVERED CALIFORNIA WHO ARE ON THE SAME INCOME RANGE IS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON MEDICARE ALL. THEY'RE PAYING TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY DOLLARS A MONTH FOR THEIR PREMIUM IF THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY DOLLARS A MONTH DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A LOT OF MONEY UNTIL YOU REALIZE FOR TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE LIVING ON TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. THEN IT'S REAL MONEY WE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE OUR ESTIMATE IS THAT COST TEN OR FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE. WE ALSO HAVE PEOPLE MAKING. BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND 38% OF POVERTY IN 2100% OF POVERTY THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND TO TWENTY FOUR OR THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. AGAIN THAT WE'RE ASKING THEM TO SPEND FIFTY A HUNDRED A HUNDRED AND THIRTY DOLLARS A MONTH ON THEIR PREMIUM SUCH A LOT OF MONEY WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO LIVE ON THAT KIND OF INCOME. WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE PROPOSAL CUTS OFF HELP AT 2100% OF POVERTY WE UNDERSTOOD IT WHEN IT HAD TO DO WITH COPAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PREMIUMS NOW. SO WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE CUT OFF A 2100% WE ALSO DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THERE ISN'T MORE GENERAL FUND HELP. THAT GOES BEYOND WHAT THE MANDATE PENALTY RAISES FOR A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION MORE ON GOING WE COULD PROVIDE REAL HELP FOR ALL THE PEOPLE I'M TALKING ABOUT. WE'RE ALSO PERPLEXED WHY WE HAVE A SUNSET ON THE AFFORDABILITY AND NOT ON THE MANDATE THE MANDATE IS AN EQUALLY COMPLICATED IN NEW THING TO DO AT THE STATE LEVEL WE SUPPORT THE MANDATE. BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO SUNSET ONE WE SHOULD PROBABLY SUNSET THE OTHER OTHERWISE WE'RE GOING TO PENALIZE PEOPLE WHEN MOST OF YOU KNOW IS CERTAINLY EVERY ELECTED OFFICIAL I'VE DEALT WITH KNOWS. THAT THE REASON PEOPLE DON'T HAVE COVERAGE AS THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT AND SO THE AFFORDABILITY HELP GOES HAND IN HAND WITH THE MANDATE. THIRD WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WE UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE DOING TAX RECONCILIATION OF WERE PROVIDING PEOPLE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS OF HELP OR SOMEONE. IS BELOW THE 4100% THRESHOLD THEY GO OVER AND THEN THE GOD IF YOU PAY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BACK ALL THE HELP THEY GOT WE WANT TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE. WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY A FOR A MEASLY TEN BUCKS A MONTH WERE TAKING PEOPLE THROUGH TAX RECONCILIATION WE JUST. THAT IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO US. WE ALSO DON'T OF YOU'RE WELCOME SIR WE ALSO DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS PROPOSAL STILL INCLUDES HEALTH CARE SHARING MINISTRY IS WHICH DESTABILIZE THE INDIVIDUAL INSURANCE MARKET. AND WHICH ALLOW INTO WHICH ALLOW ARE ALLOWED TO DISCRIMINATE ON HEALTH CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS. SO WE'RE YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD STUFF IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL I'M JUST GIVING YOU A LONG LIST OF PROBLEMS WITH THAT SO WE'RE VERY APPRECIATIVE TO BE HERE AND HAVING THE CONVERSATION. BUT THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES THAT WE HOPE GET RESOLVED OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AS YOU CLOSE DOWN THIS BUDGET THANK YOU. THANK YOU. LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE DO APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS AFFORDABILITY BUT BELIEVE IT'S INSUFFICIENT -- PARTICULARLY AS IT EXCLUDES INDIVIDUALS BELOW LEVEL -- AND SO -- WE BELIEVE THAT ANY REINSTATEMENT OF THE PENALTY SHALL I SHOULD INCLUDE ADDITIONAL AFFORDABILITY ASSISTANCE FOR INDIVIDUALS BELOW INDIVIDUALS ARE MORE PRICE SENSITIVE AND DATA HAS SHOWN. THAT THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO ENROLL IN COVERED CALIFORNIA WITH ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE ARE WE TOO ARE COMPLEX WITH THAT SUCH AS THESE. SUDDEN SETTING IN THREE YEARS -- DESPITE THE PENALTY CONTINUING IN PERPETUITY -- AND SHARE THE CONCERNS REGARDING -- HEALTH CARE SHARING MINISTRY IS AS AS THESE ARE UNREGULATED -- PLANS -- AND IF OF FINALLY -- WE DO BELIEVE INSURANCE AFFORDABILITY PROGRAM SHOULD INCLUDE SUBSIDIES AS PART OF THE DEFINITION TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS NO WRONG DOOR THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU.

THE INTENT OF THE FUNDING WOULD BE DIRECTLY GOING TO LOCAL HOSTERS SECTIONS A LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS CONDENSE A CONTRACT WITH A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. AS LINE WHICH IS CURRENTLY READ. THEIR GOOD THAT WAS GOING TO BE A SPECIFIC QUESTION OF MINE. ALL RIGHT LET'S OPEN THIS UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT. I'M SURE MEMBERS RANDY MARTIN ON BEHALF OF THE AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION WE DON'T HAVE ANY PARTICULAR CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL AS A STANDALONE MAY WRITE ME REVISED PROPOSAL. HOWEVER IF THIS IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION INTENDS TO RESPOND TO THE STD -- EPIDEMIC THEN IT'S A UNFORTUNATELY HOLY AN ADEQUATE -- THERE IS A PROPOSAL FOR FOUR YEARS OF FUNDING WE'VE BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD BEFORE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN YOU ALL APPROPRIATED FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. THAT WAS CARRIED OVER FOR THREE YEARS I COULD ONLY STILL BE USED FOR PURCHASING -- ISSUE -- ITEMS AND TEST KITS AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT COULD NOT BE USED TO PAY FOR ON THE GROUND BOOKS ON THE GROUND PEOPLE ACTUALLY DO THE WORK -- WHICH IS WHAT'S REALLY DRIVING THE EPIDEMIC NOW. IT'S ALSO TOO LITTLE AMOUNT OF MONEY -- STDS HAVE BEEN HOLE ARE SORELY FUNDED OVER THE LAST DECADE OR MORE -- AND TO PUT TWELVE FORTY MILLION OVER FOUR YEARS TO COVER NOT ONLY STDS BUT ALL OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES MEANS THAT ONLY HAPPENS WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ANY OF THOSE DISEASES LET ALONG. THE ONE THAT IS ESCALATING MORE RAPIDLY THAN THAN -- ANY OTHERS -- AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSIDER I CONTINUE TO CONSIDER THE PROPOSAL IS BEFORE YOU. ONE OTHER POINT I WOULD MAKE AN THAT IS RELATIVE TO THE DIRECTION TO LOCAL -- FOR LOCAL ASSISTANCE -- THERE IS NOTHING IN LAW NOW THAT GIVES DPH ANYMORE ROBUST -- DIRECTION ABOUT HOW THEY SHOULD BE DEALING WITH ASK YOU DO YOU CRISIS ON THE GROUND I'M YOU ARE LOOKING AT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WE HOPE WILL CONSIDER THAT WILL ACTUALLY GIVE THEM SOME GREATER DIRECTION. ABOUT HOW THEY CAN USE THOSE FUNDS MORE EFFECTIVELY WE THINK THAT'S A MUCH MORE. ROBUST PACKAGE FOR YOU TO CONSIDER THEM THAN THIS ONE AS FAR AS TNCS ARE CONCERNED THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

IF YOU DO TEN MILLION A YEAR OVER FOUR YEARS IT'S REALLY NOT ENOUGH -- WE KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT ENOUGH TO FIX A FOR YOUR WORTH OF DUTIES AND SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE CAN MAXIMIZE THE FUNDING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IF YOU PROVIDE THAT INVESTMENT UP FRONT. FORTY MILLION DISTRIBUTED AT AS A WITH A LUMP SUM GRANT TELL TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SO WE WOULD ENCOURAGE A CONSIDERATION OF THAT WE ALSO ENCOURAGE ALLEGE THE LEGISLATURE TO MAINTAIN THE FLEXIBILITY IN THE FUNDING TO NOT GO BACK TO BEING DISEASE SPECIFIC BUT TO ALLOW IT TO CONTINUE TO BE.

SEEING NONE I THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION [inaudible] ISSUE. EIGHTEEN WELCOME BACK HELLO AGAIN SUSANVILLE AYE CHIEF DEPUTY FOR PUBLIC HEALTH -- THIS PROPOSAL IS TWELVE FOR TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS AND FIFTEEN POSITIONS FROM THE EDUCATION PREVENTION AND USE FUND FOR CANNABIS -- IT BUILDS ON WHAT ARE ONE TIME FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVED FROM DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR A YOUTH -- CAMPAIGN ON THE RISKS OF CANNABIS AND SO WHAT WE DID WAS BUILD THE LET'S TALK CANNABIS CAMPAIGN WHICH INCLUDED -- PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S LEGAL WHAT'S NOT LEGAL -- WHAT THE PENALTIES LOOK LIKE WHAT THE RISKS ARE FOR PREGNANT BREASTFEEDING WOMEN AS WELL AS YOUTH -- THIS WOULD BUILD A SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM SO THAT WE KNOW WHAT THE IMPACTS OF LEGALIZING CANNABIS REALLY ARE -- BRINGING TOGETHER OVER THE FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS WE'D BE BUILDING THAT DATA SYSTEM SO BRINGING IN NEW DATA SOURCES MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE. ANALYTIC CAPACITY TO LOOK AT THAT DATA -- WHETHER THAT DATA IS RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS FOR CAN'T ABOUT US -- CORRECTIONAL DATA HOSPITAL UTILIZATION DATA YEAH MASS DATA BRINGING ALL OF THAT TOGETHER SO WE COULD GET A BETTER PICTURE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH CANNABIS AROUND THE STATE. OVER TIME THE AND WE WOULD CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THE EDUCATION COMPONENT OF THAT WORKING WITH OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE PROVIDING THEM WITH THE TOOLS AND INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED. TO BE TO EDUCATE OUR YOUTH AND OUR PARENTS ABOUT WHAT THE RISKS ARE OF CANNABIS AND SO HAVING THAT BETTER -- DATA CAPACITY TO THAN TARGET OUR INTERVENTION SO THAT WE REALLY ARE MAKING THEM MEANINGFUL OVERTIME [inaudible] THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS A SONY PEDICLE A WE JUST HAVE A MINOR COME IN I MEAN THESE ARE FUNDS THAT ARE CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED BECAUSE OF PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR BUT THAT SAID -- ONE POINT WE WANT TO MAKE ABOUT THE DATA IS THE DATA COLLECTION AND THE DATA REPORTING THE DATA SYSTEMS IS JUST THAT. CANNABIS IS JUST ONE SUBSTANCE OUT OF MANY SUBSTANCES THAT CAN AFFECT YOUTH AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE DEPARTMENT CAN. CREATE SORT OF A COHESIVE -- DASHBOARD -- OR WAY TO ACCESS INFORMATION TO DO COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS -- WOULD BE QUITE HELPFUL. I CAN RESPOND TO THAT. YEAH WE'RE BUILDING. WHAT WE CALL THE ECOSYSTEM OF DATA AND SO WE'RE USING THESE DOLLARS FOR CANNABIS MUCH LIKE WE'RE USING OPI DOLLARS TO START TO BUILD THAT STATEWIDE -- SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM WHEREBY WE CAN LOOK ACROSS DISEASES -- COSTS SPECIFIC THINGS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE LEARNING HOW THEY INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER AND SO BY PULLING THOSE INDIVIDUAL DATA ANY OF THAT USING OUR FUNDING AS WISELY AS POSSIBLE TO BUILD THE COMPONENTS THAT WE NEED FOR CANNABIS. BUT CONNECTING UP TO A HUB SO THAT ALTHOUGH DATABASES MAY LIVE IN OTHER PLACES WE CAN BRING ALL OF THAT DATA INTO ONE PLACE SO THAT ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS BENEFIT FROM THAT INFORMATION. DOES THE HUB ALREADY EXIST WE'RE BUILDING THAT NOW AND WE'RE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PIECE DOLLARS TOGETHER FROM FEDERAL OPIOID DOLLARS WHEN WE GET DISEASE SPECIFIC MONEY WE TRY TO BUILD OUT. SO THAT WE CAN BRING ALL OF THIS TOGETHER IN THE HUB. AND WE HAVE A ON GOING PLAN FOR BUILDING [inaudible] OKAY. THE NEXT WITNESS. OKAY LET'S OPEN IT UP FOR TO PUBLIC COMMENT. CHAU GIVEN THAT THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION A CALIFORNIA WE SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL SURVEILLANCE IS A VITAL COMPONENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND HELPS TO INFORM A STRATEGIES TO UTILIZE THE TYPE OF MESSAGING THAT WE EMPLOY. IN ORDER TO REACH TARGETED POPULATIONS AND SO FORTH AT SOME I LIKE IN THIS TO TOBACCO SURVEILLANCE WHICH WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR QUITE SOMETIME IN OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE REALLY CHANGED THE COURSE OF TOBACCO USE. AND I THINK THE SAME WILL BE TRUE FOR CANNABIS ALWAYS SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL FOR THOSE REASONS THANK YOU [inaudible] Q.. SPRING ABOUT TO THE COMMITTEE DOCTOR WOULD -- THE SURVEILLANCE CAN YOU DESCRIBE THAT A LITTLE BIT -- YEAH I'M THINKING OF SPYING ON PEOPLE I KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE APPROPRIATE BUT SAYS ENTER STAND ENSURE SYSTEM BY SURVEILLANCE WE MEAN COLLECTING DATA ACROSS DATA SAT SO WE WANT TO KNOW IF THERE ARE UTILIZATION MEDICAL UTILIZATION WE WOULD WANT INFORMATION ABOUT THAT. WE WOULD WANT INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE ARE THE RETAILERS ESTABLISHMENTS FOR CANNABIS WHERE PEOPLE CAN PURCHASE DOES THAT IMPACT PEOPLE THAT LIVE AROUND THERE TO A GREATER EXTENT AND BILL DISPARITIES INTO THE SYSTEM. WE WOULD WANT TO LOOK AT CORRECTIONS DATA ARE THERE ANY DIFFERENCES ON HOW THAT'S BEING APPLIED ACROSS THE STATE ARE THERE AREAS IN THE STATE THAT ARE MOST HIGHLY IMPACTED SO THAT WHEN WE GET. TO PUBLIC MESSAGING AND RISK INFORMATION THAT WE COULD TAILOR THOSE MESSAGES USING THAT DATA BECAUSE WITHOUT DATA WE REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW TO TARGET OR WHAT THE YEAH THE OTHER PIECE IS SORT OF A AND ATTITUDES AND BELIEFS ABOUT CANNABIS BECAUSE THE WAY THAT WE'VE CHANGED THE CURB. ON TOBACCO IS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T SEE THE REST OR DIDN'T SEE SOME OF THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE WITH OUR NEWEST CAMPAIGN ON TOBACCO IS AROUND JEWELS AND HE CIGARETTES. AND UNDERSTANDING THAT THOSE ARE CONTAIN NICOTINE OF THOSE HAVE THE SAME OBJECTIVE PERSON YOU KNOW CHARACTERISTICS SO BUILDING A SYSTEM BY WHICH WE CAN LOOK AT THAT DATA AND THE SAME WAY WE LOOK AT TOBACCO DATA WE CAN NOW LOOK AT CANNABIS AND MANY OF THE SAME WAYS. SO WELL THEN WILL YOU BE LOOKING OUT -- AREAS WHERE. CULTIVATION IS A BIG PART OF THE CULTURE OF OF CERTAIN COUNTIES IN AREA WE'RE HOPING TO BRING ALL THAT DATA AND ALTHOUGH THOSE ARE REGULATED BY DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE WE WOULD HOPE TO BRING ALL OF THAT DATA INTO ONE PLACE SO WE CAN ALL SHARE IN THE I AM. THAT DATA. BUT BECAUSE THE REASON I ASK THIS ASSET IS THAT -- IN IN SOME OF OUR IN IN A COUPLE OF MY COUNTIES WE HAVE REALLY HIGH LEVELS OF ASUS. THAT -- AND THE ONE COMMON FACTOR THERE IS HAS BEEN HAS BEEN CANNABIS AND AND SO I JUST WANT TO ASSURE THAT IF YOU'RE DOING STE. SURVEILLANCE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING NOT JUST AT RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS BUT YOU'RE LOOKING AT COMMUNITIES WERE WHERE THIS HAS BEEN CULTIVATED FOR MANY YEARS UNDER SECRECY WHATEVER -- AND THAT DOESN'T THERE THAT'S THROUGHOUT THE STATE SIDE SURE THAT'S AND WILL BE LOOKING AT THAT AS WELL IN TRYING TO BUILD AS MANY OF THOSE DATA BECAUSE PART OF WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE DATA. TO THE OTHER GROUPS THAT ARE WORKING IN THE REGULATORY MARKET AS WELL AND SO WHAT WE HAVE MANUFACTURERS BUT YOU'RE OF CANNABIS CONTROL AND SEE IF I ALSO HAVE A ROLE IN THAT SO BRING SOME OF THAT DATA TOGETHER WOULD BE VERY USEFUL GIVE. THANK GOD I JUST ADD ONE FOLLOW UP. TO THIS QUESTION IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSAL WOULD ALSO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL SURVEY WORK THROUGH SOME OF THE HEALTH SURVEYS TO HAVE A REAL UNDERSTANDING OF USAGE RATES AMONG USE AND PERCEPTIONS OF RISK THINGS LIKE THAT. EXACTLY JUST FRAZIER THE KIND OF PLAYS INTO WHAT I WAS JUST GOING TO GO TO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT PERCEPTIONS OF RISK. THROUGH THIS DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION COMPONENT. IS THERE ANYTHING IN THERE AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'RE AT IS FAR AS PER [inaudible] BROWN'S. BUT IS THERE ANYTHING THAT -- DESCRIBES OF HOW WHEN DRIVING IMPAIRMENT -- PROCESS GOES THROUGH BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF THE DRIVER'S TRAINING ANYMORE. IN THE SCHOOLS AND SO YOU KNOW WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE. LAWS THAT ARE. ENFORCEABLE FOR DRIVING WHILE IMPAIRED SO IS THERE ANYTHING THAT IS IN THERE THE SHOWS. AT THIS AGE GROUP. THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY START A A PROCESS LIKE WE'RE WE'RE DOING WITH BACK IN THE DAY WITH SEAT BELTS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT ZERO SAN SO YEAH AND SO WE'RE TRAFFIC SAFETY AND WILL BE COLLECTING THEIR DATA AS WELL AND WE THEY WORKED ON THE PUBLIC CAMPAIGN WITH US AND THEN NATIONAL THEY GOT A MILLION DOLLARS OF THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WENT. TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO PUT OUT SOME INFORMATION AND WE DO INCLUDE SOME INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE AS WELL ABOUT DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE NOT NECESSARILY JUST. THAT INFLUENCE MEANS MORE THAN ALCOHOL. ALL RIGHT TO IT -- IF THE TWELVE MILLION IS FOR BOLD SURVEILLANCE AND EDUCATION ACTIVITIES -- AND GOING BACK TO THE THE DOCTOR WOODS QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS. IN THE SURVEILLANCE IS THAT SOMETHING IS GOING TO BE DONE IN THE SCHOOLS. SOME SURVEILLANCE IT WILL INCLUDE SCHOOL DATA ABSOLUTELY -- IT WILL BE TO THERE ARE A VARIETY OF DATA SOURCES THAT WILL BE COLLECTING FROM A WHOLE VARIETY OF WHETHER IT'S CORRECTIONS OR SCHOOLS OR WE ALSO WILL DO SOME FORMATIVE RESEARCH WHICH IS MORE ON THE EDUCATION SIDE WHERE WE DO FOCUS GROUPS AND MORE DETAILED LOOK. AT INDIVIDUALS TO REALLY GET AT ME A WHAT DO THEY BELIEVE HEALTH HELP HOW DO THEY PERCEIVE RISK AROUND. AND CAN'T ABOUT SOME WHAT TYPES OF CANNABIS EDIBLES VERSUS SMOKING VERSUS OTHER USES WHICH I NEVER KNEW HOW MANY WAYS YOU COULD USE CANNABIS UNTIL I STARTED I'M NOT -- AND SO REALLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT ARE WHAT'S THE METHOD THAT THEY'RE SING AS WE SAW WITH THE DEPOK OF MARKET AS YOU RULE ONE THING OUT PEOPLE SORT OF SEE THAT AS BAD. THEY COME UP WITH SOMETHING NEW AND SO ARE WE GOING TO SEE THE OF THINGS THAT WILL BE MORE ATTRACTIVE TO USE OVER TIME AND HOW DO WE COMBAT THAT WITH RISK MESSAGE AS AND SO WILL BE COLLECTING. THAT ATTITUDINAL SORT OF SHIFT AND HOW DO WE GONNA BRING THAT AROUND SO THAT WE CAN DO WHAT WE DID WITH TO BACK. BECAUSE TWELVE MILLION SEEMS LIKE A LOT FOR SURVEILLANCE. IT IT'S BOTH SURVEILLANCE AND EDUCATION I THINK THAT WHAT WE HAVE IN OUR BCP WHAT IS REALLY THAT IN THE INITIAL STAGES OF BUILDING WILL PUT MORE TOWARDS SURVEILLANCE BUT THEN MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS WILL BE A LOT LESS EXPENSIVE. AND SO OF THEM WILL TURN MORE OF THAT TO THE PUBLIC EDUCATION AND INFORMATION CAMPAIGN. SO I DO KNOW THAT -- WHAT IT THE ON IN IN THE INFORMATION TWENTY POINT TWENTY ONE MILLION? IS FOR EDUCATION PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION -- SO I WASN'T SURE WHAT OTHER EDUCATION WAS INCLUDED IN THE TWELVE MILLION SO THE TWELVE MILLION IS A WE HAVE A COUPLE OF MILLION BLOCKED OUT FOR ITS CONTINUING THAT LET'S GET. LET'S LET'S TALK CANNABIS CAMPAIGN BASELINE REPORTING ON WHAT WE KNOW TODAY SO IT'S REALLY TAKING. WHAT DATA WE HAVE TODAY MAKING THAT INTO USABLE INFORMATION AND THEN AS WE GET MORE AND MORE DETAILED INFORMATION AND WE CAN TARGET THE MESSAGES EITHER TO GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OR TWO AGE GROUPS? THEN WILL BE DEVELOPING BETTER EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS AND AND PUTTING MORE DOLLARS TOWARDS GETTING THAT INTO SOCIAL MEDIA AND DIFFERENT WAYS OF GETTING THAT INFORMATION OUT. TO IT AND TO REALLY HIT YOUTH WHERE THEY WILL LEARN AND DIGEST THAT INFORMATION VERY GOOD THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THAT CONCLUDES ISSUE NUMBER EIGHTEEN THANK YOU ISSUE NINETEEN IT'S JUST.
