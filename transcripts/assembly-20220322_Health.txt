EIGHTEEN OH NINE BY MISS AGUIAR-CURRY. BUT SIR WHENEVER YOU'RE READY RIGHT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. FIRST I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSED COMMITMENT AMENDMENTS AND THANK YOUR STAFF FOR ALL THE HARD WORK ON THIS BILL. IS THE SAD REALITY THE SOME NURSING HOMES IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING CALIFORNIA. RETREAT RETURN. I CAN SPEAK RIGHT NOW- RICKETT GIVE PSYCH I ENTICE ICONIC DRUGS TO RESIDENTS WITH DEMENTIA TO CONTROL THE BEHAVIOR DESPITE RULES AGAINST THE MISUSE OF SUCH DRUGS AS CHEMICAL RESTRAINTS. THESE CHEMICAL RESTRAINTS ARE BEING PRESCRIBED TO SEDATE AND SUBDUE RESIDENTS WHO OFTEN USE BEHAVIOR TO COMMUNICATE THEIR PAIN DISCOMFORT OR DISTRESS. AB EIGHTEEN OH NINE WILL HELP STEM THIS PRACTICE IN CALIFORNIA. ACCORDING TO A TWO HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN REPORT BY THE HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH THIS ABUSIVE PRACTICES BECOME MORE RIGHTS WIDE SPREAD BASED ON THE RESEARCHERS VISITS TO MORE THAN A HUNDRED NURSING FACILITIES IN SIX STATES AND MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED INTERVIEWS WITH PEOPLE LIVING FACILITIES THEIR FAMILIES STAFF LONG TERM CARE AND DISABILITY EXPERTS. GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ADVOCATES ARE HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH REPORT THEY WANT DOCILE OIL HOW AND HOW NURSING HOMES IN THE UNITED STATES OVER MEDIA PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA ESTIMATES THAT EVERY WEEK AND US NURSING FACILITIES MORE THAN A HUNDRED SOME NINE THOUSAND PEOPLE MOSTLY THOSE OLDER LIVING WITH DEMENTIA ARE GIVEN ANTI PSYCHOTIC DRUGS WITHOUT AN APPROPRIATE DIAGNOSIS. FACILITIES ADMINISTER THESE DRUGS IN MANY CASES WITHOUT OBTAINING INFORMED CONSENT FROM RESIDENTS OR THEIR FAMILIES. ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUGS WERE DEVELOPED TO TREAT PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS LIKE SCHIZOPHRENIA THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION REQUIRES MANUFACTURERS TO LABEL THEM WITH THE STRONGEST BLACK BOX WARNING ABOUT THE RISKS THEY POSE TO PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA. THE FDA HAS NEVER APPROVED ANTI PSYCHOTIC DRUGS A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE FOR TREATMENT OF DEMENTIA SYMPTOMS STUDIES FIND THAT ANTI PSYCHOTIC DRUGS NEARLY DOUBLE THE RISK OF DEATH IN OLDER PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA. WHEN THE DRUGS ARE ADMINISTERED WITHOUT INFORMED CONSENT PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE NOT MAKING THE CHOICES TO TAKE SUCH A RISK. AB EIGHTEEN OH NINE BUILDS ON EXISTING PROTECTIONS FOR NURSING HOME RESIDENTS IN STATE LAW REGULAR AND REGULATIONS THAT CODIFIES AND EXPANDS RULES TO ESTABLISH A NURSING HOME RESIDENTS RIGHT TO PROVIDE OR WITHHOLD. WRITTEN INFORMED CONSENT PERTAINING TO THE USE OF ANTI THERAPEUTIC DRUGS AND THE RIGHT TO BE FREE FROM CHEMICAL RESTRAINT. IT SPECIFIES THAT RESIDENTS IN THE REPRESENTATIVES MUST BE INFORMED IN WRITING ABOUT THE CUT CONTENT OF BLACK BOX WARNINGS FOR PROPOSED DRUGS AND WHETHER THE DRUGS PROPOSED USE HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE FDA. REQUIRES THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO EVALUATE NURSING FACILITY COMPLIANCE WITH THESE PROVISIONS DURING PERIODIC STATE LICENSING INSPECTIONS. I'D LIKE TO PRESENT MY TWO WITNESSES THIS AFTERNOON AFTER THE CHECK A TELL STAFF ATTORNEY FOR THE BILL'S SPONSOR AND CALIFORNIANS FOR NURSING HOME REFORM. AND LYDIA RUGEJE I RESPECTFULLY ASK THREE RIVAL. THANK YOU PLEASE GO AHEAD WHEN YOU'RE READY. AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TESTIFIED FOR A BI EIGHTEEN OH NINE MY NAME'S TONY TICKET TELL I'M SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY FOR CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM OR SPONSOR OF THE BILL. I WAS HERE IN TWO THOUSAND NINE. WHEN WE TRIED A BILL THAT WAS VERY SIMILAR TO THIS ONE. IT RECEIVED A FAIR AMOUNT OF BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND WE GOT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK BUT HE ULTIMATELY VETOED IT. IS VETO MESSAGE THE GOVERNOR SAID ESSENTIALLY. I AM NOT CONVINCED THAT THERE'S A REAL PROBLEM WITH THE STRUGGLING STUFF. LET ME- AS THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO LOOK INTO IT AND THEN REPORT BACK TO ME. TO SOME EXTENT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH DID THAT THEY DID IT WHAT WAS CALLED AN ANTI PSYCHOTIC DRUG COLLECT DRUG COLLABORATIVE. WHEN THEY WENT INTO. ABOUT FORTY TWO NURSING HOMES AND TOOK A DEEP DIVE INTO THE- PSYCHOTROPIC DRUG USAGE IN THOSE NURSING HOMES AND THEY FOUND. A LOT OF VIOLATIONS. BUT THAT REPORT WAS KIND OF LOST IN AN EXPLOSION OF INTEREST IN THIS TOPIC THAT HAPPENED AROUND TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WHEN. SOME MEDIA REPORTS AND SOME CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT HEARINGS. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL ABOUT MISUSE OF PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS IN NURSING HOMES PARTICULARLY ANTI PSYCHOTICS. N. AS MUCH AS WE PROBABLY NEEDED IT WE DIDN'T REALLY GET A LOT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT ON THAT ON THAT- CALL ON THE- CAMPAIGN TO REDUCE THE USE OF ANTI PSYCHOTIC DRUGS WHAT WE GOT WAS OF AN EFFORT TO GET VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULES- IT WAS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT USING PROVIDERS AND ADVOCATES AND REGULATORS WORKING TOGETHER TO BRING DRUG USAGE DOWN AND TO SOME EXTENT THERE WERE SOME SUCCESS THERE FOR. ABOUT FIVE YEARS THE DRUG RATES CAME DOWN NOT DRAMATICALLY BUT STEADILY AND THERE WAS I THINK IMPROVE DEMENTIA CARE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY I WAS I THINK IT WAS SOME- SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF THERE'S A LOT OF WORK PUT INTO THAT. BUT THE EVER KIND OF EXHAUSTED ITSELF IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN ATTENTION STARTED BE FOCUSED ELSEWHERE- AND THEN SINCE THE PANDEMIC STARTED WE'VE HAD A TON OF BACKSLIDING. ON THE ON THE RATES AND IT LOOKS PRETTY MUCH LIKE IT DID. TWELVE YEARS AGO WHEN WE STARTED THIS STUFF. WE REALLY AT THIS POINT WE REALLY NEED SOME HELP FROM OUR LEGISLATORS TO GO BACK TO WHERE WE WERE IN TWO THOUSAND NINE TO GET. THE BRING INFORMED CONSENT BACK TO THE- TO THE- FOR FRONT. OF EVERYBODY'S MINDS WHEN IT COMES TO USING THESE DRUGS AND MAKING SURE THAT THE VERY BEST PEOPLE TO PREVENT MISUSE. ARE GIVEN THE CHANCE TO DO THAT AND THAT'S THE RESIDENTS OR THE OR THEIR LOVED ONES THEMSELVES. BOB THE SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT'S OUR NEXT WITNESS. I'M FIRST THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SHARE MY FAMILY STORY. I IN HER LATE EIGHTIES MOM NEEDS TO PASS OUR ABILITY TO CARE FOR HER. AFTER MUCH RESEARCH WE MADE THE DRAMATIC MOVE. ENTRUSTED HER TO STRANGERS WITH OUR EXPERTS AND DEMENTIA CARE. WITHIN DAYS WE GOT A PHONE CALL FROM THE OWNER INFORMING US THAT MAMA WAS EXHIBITING. AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR. LONG STORY SHORT IF HER BEHAVIOR WHEN WE'RE NOT CURB SHE'D HAVE TO LEAVE. THE SHOCK THAT MAMA WAS A DANGER TO ANYBODY QUICKLY TURNED TO PANIC AT REALITY THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER PLACE FOR HER AND NOW WITH AN AGGRESSIVE LABEL. HOWEVER THE OWNER QUICKLY OFFERED A REMEDY THAT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL FOR OTHER RESIDENTS. MEDICATION AFTER REASSURING DISCUSSION WE AGREED WITHOUT KNOWING WE WERE ABOUT TO EXPOSE MOTHER TO TERROR PRODUCING PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS. MAMA SPIRALED SHE SWEPT AWAY BY HALLUCINATIONS OF COLORS AND BUGS ANIMALS AND DEAD FAMILY MEMBERS WITH WHOM SHE MADE PLANS CARING FOR IMAGINARY CHILDREN SHE LOST HER SENSE OF HUMOR FOR ABILITY TO REASON OR CONVERSE EVEN TO TELL SOMEONE SHE NEEDED WATER OR WAS HURTING. SHE LOST TOUCH WITH REALITY. SHE WAS ALSO CONFINED TO A WHEELCHAIR. HOUSING ATROPHY AND WEIGHT GAIN WHICH NECESSITATED EXPONENTIALLY MORE ASSISTANCE. FOR YOUR LEFT MADE A SEVEN INCH BLISTER ON HER BACK AND THE CATHETER CAUSED FREQUENT HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR SERIOUS UT EYES SHE BECAME OUR BIOTIC RESISTANT AND WE ALMOST LOST HER SEVERAL TIMES. TRIPS HOME FOR HOLIDAYS STOPPED MOM SLEPT ALL THE TIME AS DID ALL THE OTHER RESIDENTS. MY VIBRANT MOTHER HAD BEEN REDUCED TO A SHELL I'M WE THOUGHT IT WAS THE AGING PROCESS. EVENTUALLY A RESIDENT ADVOCATE WAS ASSISTING US. TO HER DRUG LIST AS A POSSIBLE RED FLAG FOR BAD CARE. AND WE GOT THE DRUGS DISCONTINUED. SOON MAMA WAS AWAKE ALL DAY THE HALLUCINATIONS STOPPED HER MEMORY SENSE OF HUMOR AND ABILITY TO REASON WERE RESTORED SHE INTERACTED WITH STAFF I'M WITH OTHER RESIDENTS SHE JOINED ACTIVITIES SHE WAS SAYING ACTUAL SIZING I'M PLAYING BINGO. AT NINETY ONE SHE LEARNED HOW TO PAINT I'M WHATEVER PICTURES WAS DISPLAYED AT A LOCAL OUR SHOW. WE COULD BRING OUR HOME AGAIN FOR HOLIDAYS. AND WE ENJOYED AN ADDITIONAL FIVE YEARS OF DELIGHT ONLY MAMA COULD BRING. I WITNESS TO OTHER RESIDENTS COME BACK TO LIFE AS WELL WHEN THEY STOP TAKING THESE DRUGS AND I LEARNED ABOUT CREATIVE METHODS TO REACH AND QUIET THE SOULS OF DEMENTIA PATIENTS USING COLOR AND MUSIC ARE SIMPLY HAVING A DOLL OR BOTH THE WHOLE ALL DRUG FREE. RARELY IN THIS LIFE DO YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP SO MANY PEOPLE AS PASSING A. B. EIGHTEEN OH NINE. IT WILL GIVE ALL CALIFORNIA FAMILIES INFORMED CHOICE TO REFUSE THE USE OF DANGEROUS DRUGS AND FRIGHTENING CHEMICAL RESTRAINT. ON THEIR LOVED ONES. PLEASE PASS THIS BILL QUICKLY FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS FOR YOUR LOVED ONES I'M PERHAPS FOR YOURSELF. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE HAVE WITNESSES AND WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. SORRY OF SUPPORT IN THAT WELL. SO WITH THE OPPOSITION OUT PLEASE I'M SORRY. ARRESTEE BY RUSTY. I'M GLAD SOMEBODY ELSE IS RUSTY. WHENEVER WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. WE YET WE CAN'T- WE SOME HELP ON THE- SERGEANTS A FOR MIKE'S NOT WORKING- MAYBE THE SIGN THAT SAYS MIKE WITH THE BIG WHITE ON IT- YEAH YEAH YES IT'S SO IT'S CLEAR WITH THAT YEAH MY YEAH YEAH OKAY GOT THAT MY GRANDPARENTS HI THIS TICKET SORRY ABOUT THAT JENNIFER SNYDER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH FACILITIES AND ALSO THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. REGRETFULLY WE- ARE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL AND IN ITS CURRENT FORM I'M WHICH FIRST I VERY MUCH WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND ALSO THE AUTHOR AND OTHER SPONSORS FOR THE DISCUSSIONS I'VE HAD WITH US SO FAR ON THIS BILL- IT IS- BOTH- THAT ASSOCIATION HEALTH FACILITIES AND C. H. A.'S INTENT- TO. TO REALLY WORK THROUGH THE CONCERNS AND THE AND THE NEEDS- FROM THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS AND SEE WHERE WE CAN COME TOGETHER ON SOMETHING THAT WILL WORK IN BOTH CASES I THINK. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE ARE REALLY TRYING TO FIND A BALANCE BETWEEN- MAKING SURE THAT PATIENTS ARE PROTECTED BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT THOSE PRESCRIBERS AND PHYSICIANS- THAT PROVIDE THE CARE ARE NOT PUT IN SITUATIONS IN THE NURSING FACILITIES THEMSELVES BUT I THINK MORE THE PRESCRIBERS ARE PUT IN SITUATIONS WHERE THEY ARE- ARE REQUIRED TO PUT TOGETHER HUMBER SOME ONEROUS AND VERY BROAD. WRITTEN CONSENT REQUIREMENTS THAT THEN ARE COUPLED WITH- CRIMINAL AND CIVIL LIABILITIES THAT ARE ATTACHED TO AN INCREASE IN INFORMED CONSENT AIR- AND SO AT LEAST THE WAY THAT EIGHTEEN OH NINE AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN IT DOESN'T JUST LOOK AT AN ANTI X. IT LOOKS AT ALL TYPES CYCLE THERAPEUTICS. IT SAYS IN ALL OF THOSE CASES. WHAT USED TO DO BUT THE FOR. AND PATIENT WITH RESPECT TO INFORMED CONSENT WHERE YOU HAD A GOOD A DIALOGUE. OR THE PATIENT THE FAMILY DID MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION. IN THE DISCUSSION WITH THE PHYSICIAN. WE NOW WANT TO TAKE ALL OF THAT INFORMATION THAT USED TO BE A DIALOGUE AND PUT IT INTO AN INFORMED CONSENT FORM. NOW AGAIN. THERE MAY BE NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT AS LONG AS WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE CREATE KIND OF A SITUATION WHERE THAT INFORMED CONSENT FORM CAN BE COMPLIED WITH- AND THEN TO COUPLE THAT WITH A CRIMINAL BATTERY CHARGE. AND THEN DALY ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE CIVIL PENALTIES ON PRESCRIBERS ARE CONCERNED FROM NURSING FACILITIES PERSPECTIVE IS WE WILL HAVE PRESCRIBERS THAT WHAT WANT TO CARE FOR PATIENTS AND WILL HAVE PATIENTS THAT WILL LOSE ACCESS. IT REALLY NEEDED. TO PSYCHO THERAPEUTIC DRUGS AND GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE BUT THOSE THOSE ARE REAL. THAT IS REALLY WERE CONCERNED LIES SO. I JUST AM I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- AGAIN I IT WE THANK THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSORS WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS- IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE ARE. WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY ALREADY- CALIFORNIA SINCE TWENTY TWELVE. HAS M. IMPROVED OVER 50% IN THERE- YOU USAGE OF PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS FOR AND FROM THERE NURSING FACILITY RIGHT- THAT RESIDENTS WE RANK THIRD IN THE NATION. IN THAT USAGE I. CAN'T SAY THAT WE DON'T NEED TO IMPROVE I CAN'T SAY THAT WE DON'T WANT TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE. AND NEVER WANT TO MAKE EXCUSES FOR SITUATIONS WHERE THIS HAPPENED TO HER MOM- I'M CERTAINLY NOT HERE TO DO THAT BUT I DO THINK THAT WE NEED TO CREATE A BALANCE SO WE CAN MAKE SURE. THAT WE PROTECT PATIENTS BUT ALSO MAKE SURE PATIENTS HAVE ACCESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. YES I AM A PHYSICIAN AND A AND THE EDITOR OF THE NEWSLETTER FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LONG TERM CARE MEDICINE. I WANT TO SHARE MY CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL. BECAUSE THE TESTIMONY WE'VE HEARD IN THE BILL ITSELF CONCENTRATES ON THE OVER USE OF ANTI PSYCHOTICS AND I'M NOT GOING TO ARGUE WITH THAT. IT'S MY CONCERN IS THE MOST COMMON MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES IN OLDER ADULTS AND IN NURSING HOMES. OR DEPRESSION. ANXIETY DISORDER AND I WILL TELL US A PRESCRIBER I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO IT HERE TO THE- REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL TO BE ABLE TO PRESCRIBE ANTI DEPRESSANTS OR ANTI ANXIETY DRUGS. BECAUSE OF SIDE EFFECTS OCCUR. IN VARYING FREQUENCIES N. I WOULD NOT KNOW WHAT. WHERE THE LINE IS IT THINGS THAT HAPPENED ONE IN A HUNDRED IT'S A THINGS THAT HAPPENED ONE IN A THOUSAND IS IT A SIDE EFFECT WHICH WAS RARE IS ONE IN A MILLION. AND YET THOSE MIGHT BE CONSIDERED MATERIAL TO INFORMED CONSENT UNDER THIS BILL AND IF I WAS WRONG AND LEFT OUT A VERY RARE SIDE EFFECT. I WOULD BE SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL PENALTIES SEN IT WOULD. CLEARLY BE A DISCOURAGEMENT. AND WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THE PROVISION OF THESE KIND OF MENTAL HEALTH DRUGS FOR NURSING HOME RESIDENTS. IS LOWER THAN THE NEED IN OTHER WORDS. THERE'S AN OVER USE OF ANTI PSYCHOTICS THERE'S AN UNDER USE OF ANTIDEPRESSANTS AND TREATMENTS FOR GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER. AND I THINK THAT- REALLY EVERY EFFORT TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR PRESCRIBERS TO PRESCRIBE FOR THOSE MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED WHERE IS THISBILL DOES EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE. THE SECOND WAY I'M AFRAID THAT THIS BILL WILL HARM PEOPLE IS WITHDRAWAL EFFECTS BECAUSE- THERE IS A REQUIREMENT UNDER THIS BILL TO DO THE CONSENT EVERY SIX MONTHS. AND YET AS A NURSING HOME DOCTOR IT'S COMMON TO SEE STABLE PATIENTS ABOUT ONCE A MONTH. AND WHAT I WORRY ABOUT IS IF YOU FORGET TO GET INFORMED CONSENT ON THE FIFTH MONTH. YOU MIGHT EXCEED THE SIX MONTHS BEFORE YOU VISIT THEM AGAIN AND THE NURSING HOME WOULD BE OBLIGED TO STOP THE MEDICINE ABRUPTLY. WHERE IS THESE ARE ALL MEDICINES THAT WE NORMALLY PAPER WHEN WE DISCONTINUED. AND IF YOU ABRUPTLY STOP THEM THEY'RE REALLY ASSOCIATED WITH SIDE EFFECTS AND SO I'M CONCERNED THAT THESE COMMON CONDITIONS AND I'M SURE YOU DEPRESSION IS COMMON. WILL CLOSE FOR THANK YOU THANK YOU AND FOR THE RECORD DR COULD YOU WOULD YOU MIND GIVING US YOUR NAME OKAY LUXEMBOURG THANK YOU FOR SHE IS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE WILL NOW GO TO- OTHER WITNESSES IN THE ROOM OF PLEASE COME FORWARD JUST WITH JUST YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION AND POSITION ON THE BILL PLEASE. YES MEAN OUR SYSTEM.

AND WE HAVE NO- NO ONE IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MR MACE. YEAH LET'S ADD TO THAT BUTTON WITH MI SEE ON IT YEAH THERE WE GO. THIS IS FANCY. SUPER FANCY THEY DID A GREAT JOB AS MY FIRST COMMITTEE HEARING HE DID A GREAT JOB WITH THIS- WITH THIS- FACILITY- SO- HUH I THINK IT A BIT LOOKING AT THIS BILL OBVIOUSLY UNDERSTAND THE INTENT IN THIS IS THE THESE WERE GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS YOU'RE GONNA BE WORKING A WORKING THROUGH- ALL OF IT- I HAVE- ENDED UP- MARRYING A PROVIDER DENTISTRY OF COURSE NOT- IN. IT'S NOT A PHYSICIAN AND DOESN'T WORK IN A- HEALTH FACILITY. I LEARNED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- CONSENT FORMS AND SORT OF THE PROCESS OF ALL OF THAT. AND THERE IS A SENSE AMONG PROVIDERS WHO HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS. VERY QUICKLY- WHETHER YOU'RE MAKING A RIGHT DECISION OR- A WRONG DECISION. AND THE THOUGHT OF BEING CHARGED WITH A CRIMINAL. OFFENSE FOR- FOR THEIR PROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR IS PRETTY STRONG- AND SO IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE A LOOK AT. A WIDER DID GET IN THE BILL IN THE FIT IN THE FIRST PLACE IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S NECESSARY- IF YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT PROVISION I UNDERSTAND IF YOU'RE GOING TO. DO SOMETHING YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ENFORCEMENT MAC ISM BUT- AS A SEATS PRETTY STRONG. WILL LOBBY THE FIRST DEGREE THAT THE BATTERY ISN'T THE CORRECT PENALTY THAT WE HAVE IN THE BILL AS IT IS NOW. AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT DURING THE NEXT COMMUNITY WHEN WE GO TO THE ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY. AND WE'LL FIGURE OUT WHAT OF- PENALTIES ARE APPROPRIATE. SO AT THAT TIME WE WILL GO WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS BILL AND SO AS YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THIS AS WELL- IT AGAIN BUT I THINK PART OF IT IS YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROVIDERS ACTORS YEAH THERE THERE'S A HUNDRED YEAH FOR SURE THOSE BAD ACTORS- AND SO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME SORT OF MECHANISM FOR THE SAME TIME YOU DON'T WANT TO. DETER PROVIDERS- YOU KNOW PHYSICIANS FOR MAKING DECISIONS BECAUSE IF THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO BE MAKING A DECISION. THAT THEY'RE GONNA LOSE OUR LICENSES THEY'RE GONNA END UP IN A IN IN IN JAIL OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE THAT IT ENDS UP HAVING A CHILLING EFFECT ON THE CARE THAT THEY MIGHT NEED TO PROVIDE. AND SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE WE'RE CAREFUL OF THAT. ABSOLUTELY REJECT MAKE INCOME. BUT ABSOLUTELY AGREE- THE IDEAS. HAVING APPROPRIATE PROPORTIONALITY. OF IF IT'S IF IT'S A PRESCRIBERS MADE AN- HONEST MISTAKE. PAPERWORK AIR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THERE'S NO CRIMINAL LIABILITY FOR THAT BUT FOR THOSE WHO. AND YOU KNOW FOR LOTS AND LOTS OF RESIDENTS ARE PRESCRIBED MAKING PRESCRIPTIONS FOR DRUGS THAT THEY PROBABLY DON'T NEED AND THAT PROBABLY HURT THEM IF THAT'S A PATTERN AND PRACTICE AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT MADE. YOU KNOW REQUIRE SOME SORT OF SIGNIFICANT PENALTY. IT AND THEN JUST FINE I'M SORRY MISTER CHAIR JUST YOU KNOW IT IN REGARDS TO THE INFORMED CONSENT AS WELL. ALL OF US WHEN WE GO TO BE ABLE TO GO TO THE DOCTOR WE GO TO THE DENTIST WE GET A STACK OF PAPERWORK. AND WE GO THROUGH IT I MEAN WHO READS ALL OF IT. I MEAN REALLY WHO READS WHO READS ALL OF THAT AND THE LONGER THAT IT IS THE LESS INCLINED YOU ARE TO ACTUALLY. THAT TO BE ABLE TO READ IT AND SO YOU KNOW PART OF THAT IF YOU'RE GONNA. OF CONSENT FORM YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE IT'S VERY SIMPLE AND- AND THAT IT'S NOT TOO OVERLY COMPLICATED BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S JUST- IF YOU HAVE TOO MUCH OF IT PEOPLE JUST SIGNED SIGNED AWAY SIGN A LIFE AWAY- I'M LITERALLY- I THINK- SIGN SIGN THEIR LIFE AWAY. JUST AS A QUICK ASIDE IT BUT- YOU KNOW. THAT AT THE TWELVE WEEK OLD. TODAY AS OF THE END IN DECEMBER- WHILE WE WERE IN THE HOSPITAL'S PRETTY FAST NAY LOWER IN THE HOSPITAL. WAITING FOR. A BABY. TO COME. AS THE AT THE FACILITY- EVERY. FIVE MINUTES SOMEBODY'S. COMING IN WITH AN IPAD SAYING SIGN HERE SIGN HERE SIGN HERE. IF NOT IDEA WHAT YOU'RE SIGNING IS YOUR- IF YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THIS YEAR THEY'RE IN PAIN OR GOING THROUGH SO. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WERE. CAREFUL ABOUT SORT OF THE PROCESS. OF ALL THIS IS WELL- AND SOMETIMES WE MAKE LAWS TO THIS. AND WE CAN BE IT CAN BE TOUGH TO AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE WE'RE CAREFUL ABOUT THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAYES I JUST I WANNA AGREE WITH YOU YOU KNOW THE- THE KEY IS TO BE MINDFUL. AND THOUGHTFUL IN HOW WE DO THIS. AS WE HAVE SO MANY OF OUR LOVED ONES THAT ARE GOING TO HOMES. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE SAFE. AND OF THIS IS JUST REALLY COME TO THE SURFACE ARE QUITE. A BIT LATELY WITH THE QUOTE DURING COVERT. FRIENDS OF-MINE HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS. AND SO REALLY KIND OF HIT HOME AND THIS IS APPROPRIATE TIME. OF GRANTED I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS TO FINE TUNE IT AND CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION WE ALL HAVE GOOD. RELATIONSHIPS WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE. WITH MISS WALDRON. VICE CHAIR. WALDRON ANOTHER WAY WE'VE HAD A CHANGE OF CARE SO. THAT A VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. I FIGURE OUT THE MICROPHONE. NO I JUST WANNA PICKING BACK OFF OF OUR OUR COLLEAGUES- COMMENTS. AS WELL AND- IT IS AN ISSUE BUT AS WAS MENTIONED IT WOULD IT'S BEEN REDUCED- QUITE A BIT IN CALIFORNIA I HAD AN AUNT WHO WAS IN HER LATE EIGHTIES FOUND WANDERING. OF IMMEDIATELY WHEN SHE WENT INTO THE NURSING HOME WAS PUT ON THOSE DRUGS. AND CHANGED. YOU KNOW IN MANY WAYS BUT LUCKILY SHE HAD THE SENSE OF MIND BEFORE ALL OF THIS TO HAVE MY BROTHER B. I HAVE POWER OF ATTORNEY. WHO'S A PHYSICIAN HE WENT IN ON RIVALED EVERYTHING NOT JUST DRUGS. THE MONEY EVERYTHING THAT THEY HAD GONE IN AND TAKEN EVERYTHING- BUT IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE. EVERYONE UP HERE IS AN AGREEMENT THAT WE NEED TO REDUCE THE USE OF CONTROL HOW IT'S DONE GET THE APPROPRIATE PROCESS TO SIGN YOU KNOW THESE PAPERS AND NOT MAKE IT. WORTH A PHYSICIAN YOU KNOW IS GOING TO PRISON OR LOSING THE LICENSE OVER SOMETHING THAT COULD BE JUST A- AN HONEST MISTAKE. BUT- I LOOK FORWARD TO. YOU ALL WORKING TOGETHER ON THIS AND- COMING TO A SOLUTION THAT HELPS THE PATIENT. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE I WOULD JUST I GUESS I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY- I KIND OF A LINE MY COMMENTS WITH WHAT YOU'RE HEARING HERE TOO AS A SOMEONE WHO WAS A PRACTITIONER FOR NEARLY THIRTY YEARS- AND DEL ON A DAILY BASIS- MULTIPLE TIMES WITH INFORMED CONSENT IT WHAT MOTIVATED ME WAS NUMBER ONE. THE PATIENT MAKING SURE THEY UNDERSTOOD EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE WE WERE DOING AND WHAT THE POTENTIAL RAMIFICATIONS OF THAT BUT THE HAMMER ON THE OTHER END FOR ME WAS THE THREAT OF A LAWSUIT AND SO- I DID WANT TO GET SUED BASED ON MY CONDUCT OR MY LACK OF CONDUCT SO- SO YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A YOU KNOW THERE'S A FINE LINE HERE NOW ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN YOU GOT A REPEAT OFFENDER YOU KNOW AND EGREGIOUS VIOLATION OF- PAY A PATIENTS RIGHTS THAT'S A DIFFERENT AND- AND I THINK. MY SENSES THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET TO IS IT IS YOU KNOW EVEN IN THE BEST A WORLD THAT SOMETIMES YOU KNOW- AND INFORMED CONSENT TO ONE PERSON MAY NOT BE TO ANOTHER AND SO THERE'S A CHALLENGE THERE'S A CHALLENGE WITH THAT AS WELL. ANYWAY THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISS JERRY TALKING EVERY TAKING AMENDMENTS THE OTHER ARE WE ADDING ASKING FOR THERE ARE AMENDMENTS. SHE HAS ACCEPTED AMENDMENTS THE AMENDMENTS YES- AND- SO I THINK YOU'LL SEE WE DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM HERE SO WE'D BE THERE IS NO THERE IS NO MOTION AT THIS POINT IT WILL IT TOO I DO. RECOMMENDATION WHEN THAT TO BE RIGHT SO- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE US ASSEMBLY AUSTRIA RIVAL IN THE TIMES APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN A MEMBERS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU TO WITNESSES AS WELL. AFTER ARAMBULA. A REGULAR HAS TWO BILLS BEFORE US AB NINETEEN HUNDRED AND AB NINETEEN NINETY FIVE AND START WITH AB NINETEEN HUNDRED. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. AB NINETEEN HUNDRED WILL ALLOW CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE OLDER AND DISABLED TO KEEP MORE OF THEIR MONEY EXCUSE ME MORE OF THEIR MONTHLY INCOME TO PAY FOR NECESSITIES LIKE FOOD CLOTHES AND SHELTER WHILE STILL QUALIFYING FOR MEDICAL. DESPITE OUR HIGH COST OF LIVING HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE TRAILED BEHIND SEVERAL STATES AND HOW MUCH PEOPLE IN CERTAIN MEDICAL PROGRAMS MUST PAY FOR THEIR OWN HEALTH CARE BEFORE MEDICARE KICKS IN. TODAY OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES FOR JUST ONE DOLLAR OVER THE FREE MEDICAL LIMIT ARE FORCED TO SURVIVE ON JUST SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS TO PAY FOR THE RENT FOR THEIR FOOD AND THEIR UTILITIES AS WELL AS ALL OF THEIR OTHER EXPENSES. THIS PROGRAM HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AN OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE PAYING THE PRICE. THIS IS SIMPLY A MATTER OF FAIRNESS FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. AND NEED ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. HI MAKING THIS MUCH NEEDED ADJUSTMENT WITH AB NINETEEN HUNDRED WE CAN HELP TO EASE THE FINANCIAL BURDENS. SO THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT CHOOSING BETWEEN THE NEED FOR MEDICAL ATTENTION AND THE NEED TO PAY FOR RENT TENDS TO BUY FOOD. IT IS TIME FOR US TO DITCH THE DEDUCTIBLE AND TO MAKE CALIFORNIA A LEADER IN MEDIC CALIFORNIA BILITY FOR SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF AB NINE TEAM HUNDRED ARE SO WHITE SAY YOU FROM DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS BE LET YOU AGAIN. FROM THE CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH PLEASE GO AHEAD WHEN YOU'RE READY. THINGS ARE DIFFERENT HERE TODAY. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU SO WHITE C. M. ON BEHALF OF DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. WE ARE THE DESIGNATED PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY AGENCY FOR CALIFORNIA MANDATED TO ADVANCE THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF CALIFORNIANS WITH DISABILITIES. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA SHARED THE SHARE OF COST PROGRAM ACTS AS A CRITICAL PATHWAY TO HEALTH COVERAGE FOR LOW INCOME OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. WHO HAVE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH CARE NEEDS BUT ARE JUST ABOVE THE FREE MEDIC CAL INCOME LIMIT. THE OUTDATED INCOME LIMITS HAVE FORCED PEOPLE TO SPEND MORE THAN HALF OF THEIR INCOME ON HEALTH CARE NEEDS EVERY MONTH. THE RESULT OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE PUSHED INTO EXTREME POVERTY AND SOME JUST FORGO CARE ENTIRELY BECAUSE IT'S JUST TOO EXPENSIVE. THIS MEANS NO DENTAL COVERAGE NO SERVICES NO SUPPORTS TO HELP YOU REMAIN IN YOUR HOME. AND NO COVERAGE FOR ANYTHING AT ALL IF YOU'RE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE ON SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. THAT'S WHAT THE PROGRAM DEMANDS OF OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WHO NEED CARE. WHEN PEOPLE CAN'T ACCESS HEALTH AT HOME CARE THEY OFTEN END UP HOSPITALIZED OR INSTITUTIONALIZED OR HAVE TO RELY ON ALREADY STRETCHED FAMILY MEMBERS TO PROVIDE UNPAID CARE. THIS IS ALSO AN EQUITY ISSUE IT'S NOT FAIR THAT OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE THE ONLY POPULATION FORCED TO PAY SO MUCH TO OBTAIN ESSENTIAL HEALTH CARE. MOST LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE THEIR HEALTH CARE FOR FREE. AND AT MOST DO NOT HAVE TO PAY MORE THAN EIGHT POINT 5% OF THEIR INCOME ON HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. YET LOW INCOME OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES HER ONLY A DOLLAR OVER THE LIMIT FOR FREE MEDIKAL AND LIVE ON FIXED INCOMES ARE EXPECTED TO PAY 60% OF THEIR MONTHLY INCOME ON HEALTH CARE EXPENSES. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA SHARED IT REALLY IS TIME TO DITCH THE DEDUCTIBLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF AB NINETEEN HUNDRED I'M BAILEY AGAIN A LONG TERM CARE ADVOCATE WITH CALIFORNIA TICKETS FOR NURSING HOME REFORM. MY TESTIMONY TODAY IS ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT OF MINE- WHO ISN'T ABLE TO APPEAR IN PERSON HER NAME IS NOT THE SHEPHERDING AND THIS IS ABOUT HER PARENTS JOSE AND LISA. NOT THE COLOR OFFICES TO LEARN MORE ABOUT MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY FOR HER FATHER JOSE WHO IS SEVENTY SEVEN YEARS OLD AND HER MOTHER LISA WHO IS SEVENTY EIGHT YEARS OLD. BOTH OF THEM ARE IMMIGRANTS WHO HAVE BEEN LIVING IN THE UNITED STATES FOR OVER FIFTY FOUR YEARS WAS A WORK TWO JOBS AND AFTER FORTY ONE YEARS OF WORKING HE RETIRED. SHORTLY AFTER RELEASE TO BEGIN CHAU EARLY SIGNS OF ALZHEIMER'S AND RELIED ON JOSE AS HER PRIMARY CAREGIVER UNTIL HIS HEALTH STARTED TO DECLINE AS WELL. NOT BEEN RESERVING HOPE TO FIND IN HOME SUPPORT THROUGH MEDIC CAL FOR BOTH OF HER PARENTS. HOUSE IN A LEASE YES TOTAL MONTHLY INCOME IS TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS WHICH PUTS THEM ABOVE THE 110038% FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL FOR A COUPLE. MEANING THAT IF THEY APPLY FOR MEDICAL TOGETHER THEY WILL HAVE A SHARE OF COST. THE PROBLEM IS THEIR SHARE OF COST WOULD BE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY SIX DOLLARS BECAUSE THE MAINTENANCE NEEDS LEVEL FOR A COUPLE. IS ONLY NINE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR DOLLARS. THIS LEAVES JOSE IN A LEASE SALE WITHOUT ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR OTHER NECESSITIES SUCH AS RENT. FOOD OR UTILITIES. NOT THE AND HER SIBLINGS ARE ALREADY HELPING WITH THE BILLS BUT WITH THE SHERIFF COSTS THAT HIGH THE FAMILY COULD NOT AFFORD. FOR BOTH PARENTS TO APPLY FOR MEDICAL. IN ORDER TO AVOID A HUGE SHARE OF COST THE ONLY OPTION FOR NOT THESE PARENTS WOULD BE TO PRIORITIZE. THE PARENT WITH THE HIGHER NEED. AND SUBMIT A MEDICAL APPLICATION SEEKING SPOUSAL IMPOVERISHMENT PROTECTIONS. ALTHOUGH HER MOM REQUIRES A LOT OF CARE THE FAMILY DECIDED TO ONLY HAVE JOSE APPLY AS HIS HEALTH WAS DECLINING RAPIDLY. THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM THAT I'VE COME ACROSS DURING MY TIME I CAN'T AWARE FAMILIES HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN WHICH PARENT RECEIVES CARE. BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD THE SHERIFF COST. IF THE MAINTENANCE NEED LEVELS INCREASE TO MATCH THE 110030% FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. POSING A LEASE. OF WOULD ONLY BE THREE HUNDRED NINETY FOUR DOLLARS. WHICH WOULD BE A LOT MORE FEASIBLE FOR NOT THIS FAMILY AND WOULD ALLOW BOTH. JSE LEE SAID RECEIVE SERVICES THROUGH MEDIC CAL. INCREASING THE MAINTENANCE THE LEVEL WOULD ALLOW OLDER AND DISABLED CALIFORNIANS ACCESS. TO NECESSARY KERR WILL KEEPING MORE MONEY TO REMAIN IN THE COMMUNITY. NOT THE SAYS I'M ASKING FOR REFORM OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT ADDRESSES THE MEDICAL NEEDS OF MINORITY GROUPS LIKE MY PARENTS. THESE ARE MY PARENTS THEY HAVE RAISE GREAT CHILDREN AND THEY DESERVE TO ENJOY THEIR FAMILY RETIREMENT.

LARA MAIENSCHEIN MAYES MCCARTY NAZARIAN REALIST RODRIGUEZ SANTIAGO SANTIAGO I. YOUR FIVE VOTES WILL LEAVE THE BILL ON CALL AND SHOULD THE BILL PASS OUT OF COMMITTEE I'D LIKE TO ASK FOR TO BE CONSIDERED AS A CO AUTHOR ON YOUR BILL SOUNDS GREAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YES GO AHEAD WITH YOUR NEXT BILL AB NINETEEN NINETY FIVE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. AB NINETEEN NINETY FIVE WILL ENSURE LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS CAN ACCESS HEALTHCARE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. TO STAY HEALTHY AND THRIVE BY ELIMINATING THEIR MONTHLY MEDICAL PREMIUMS. AND COPAYMENTS. DURING MY YEARS AS AN EMERGENCY ROOM PHYSICIAN. I SAW WHAT HAPPENED TO PEOPLE AND FAMILIES THAT DELAYED MEDICAL CARE. BECAUSE THEY HAD NO ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE. OR HAD LOST THEIR INSURANCE. THE CONSEQUENCES WERE SEVERE. DEVASTATING OR WORST. WE NEED TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM SO THAT PREGNANT WOMEN CHILDREN AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES CAN BE ASSURED THAT THEIR MEDICAL COVERAGE CONTINUES AND THAT THEY WON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN PAYING FOR THEIR HEALTH CARE OR PAYING FOR HOUSEHOLD BILLS. MEDICAL PREMIUMS AND COPAYMENTS ARE A RELIC OF THE PAST. IT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH WHERE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE IS GOING WHICH IS TO BE MORE INCLUSIVE. IT ALSO FLIES CONTRARY TO CALIFORNIA'S GOALS IN TERMS OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THREATENS THE ECONOMIC SECURITY OF INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES FROM ACROSS THE STATE. AB NINETEEN NINETY FIVE WILL SOLVE THIS ISSUE BY ELIMINATING THE MEDIC CAL COPAYMENTS AND PREMIUMS FOR PREGNANT INDIVIDUALS CHILDREN AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF AB NINETEEN NINETY FIVE ARCADY ANDREW THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF HEALTH AT CHILDREN NOW AS WELL AS LINDA WAY THE SENIOR POLICY ADVOCATE AT WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. GOOD AFTERNOON CHERRY MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO THE IMPORTANT IMPACT THAT AB NINETEEN NINETY FIVE WOULD HAVE ON THE LIVES OF NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND LOW INCOME CHILDREN PREGNANT PEOPLE AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES BY ELIMINATING MEDICAL PREMIUMS AND COPAYMENTS PROVIDES FREE OR LOW COST HEALTH COVERAGE THAT HELPS IMPROVE HEALTH REDUCE DISABILITY AND INCREASED EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT AND ECONOMIC STABILITY. HOWEVER HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN PREGNANT PEOPLE AND INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES ARE ON THE HOOK FOR MONTHLY PREMIUMS THAT DO NOT YIELD TO NIC SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS FOR THE STATE. BUT DO CREATE AN ADDITIONAL ECONOMIC BURDEN FOR PEOPLE ALREADY. STRUGGLING FINANCIALLY. OFTEN LEADING FAMILIES TO CHOOSE BETWEEN PAYING THEIR PREMIUMS OR PAYING FOR OTHER BASIC NECESSITIES LIKE FOOD RENT AND DIAPERS. BY ELIMINATING MONTHLY MEDICARE PREMIUMS AND COPAYMENTS AB IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE WILL NOT ONLY ALLEVIATE THESE IMPOSSIBLE CHOICES FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES BUT WILL ALSO RESULT IN REDUCED COVERAGE CHURN IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. ADDITIONALLY ELIMINATING MEDICAL PREMIUMS AND MEDIKAL- SORRY ELIMINATING PREMIUMS A MEDIC CAL PROMOTES HEALTH COVERAGE FOR CALIFORNIA FAMILIES AND PROMOTES EQUITY BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COVERAGE. LAST YEAR LAWMAKERS ALLOCATED FUNDING TO PROVIDE ZERO DOLLAR COVERAGE FOR CAL OF COVERED CALIFORNIA MEMBERS NOTING THAT EVEN NOMINAL COST TO TURN ROMAN IN AND UTILIZATION OF HEALTH COVERAGE. MEDIC HOW KIDS AND FAMILIES DESERVE THE SAME RELIEF. AND PROTECTION. IN THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE PROPOSED BUDGET AND SUBSEQUENT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO REDUCE TO ZERO MEDICAL PREMIUMS WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS LANGUAGE GOES FAR ENOUGH LEAVING THE DOOR OPEN FOR A FUTURE ADMINISTRATION TO REINSTATE MEDIC HELP PREMIUM AND COPAYMENT REQUIREMENTS. THIS IS EXTREMELY PROBLEMATIC GIVEN THAT THE FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO PAY MEDICAL PREMIUMS AND COPAYMENTS ARE LIKELY TO BE IT BE HIT THE HARDEST BY AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF ONLY FOUR STATES IN THE NATION TO REQUIRE CHILDREN IN MEDICAID TO PAY PREMIUMS FOR COVERAGE GOING AGAINST WHAT OUR GREAT STATE TOUTS IS A STRONG COMMITMENT TO HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESS. COMPLETE ELIMINATING MEDICAL PREMIUMS AND COPAYMENTS FOR ALREADY STRUGGLING FAMILIES AND THOSE WITH DISABILITIES WILL BRING US ONE STEP CLOSER TO A MORE JUST HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE ON AB NINETEEN NINETY FIVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS LED AWAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY PROUD TO CO SPONSOR AB NINETEEN NINETY FIVE WHICH WOULD ELIMINATE MEDICARE PREMIUMS AND COPAYMENTS. TO ENSURE LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS CAN ACCESS NEEDED HEALTH CARE SERVICES. WHAT DISABILITIES MEDICARE ALLOWS THEM TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY IN THE COMMUNITY AND AVOID COSTLY INSTITUTIONALIZATION EVEN WITH INCOMES BELOW TWENTY EIGHT FIFTY A MONTH PEOPLE WORKING PART TIME ARE STILL EXPECTED TO PAY UP TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS IN MONTHLY. MEDICARE PREMIUMS THIS BILL WILL ALLOW PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES TO KEEP MORE OF THEIR INCOME ON BASIC NECESSITIES. IN ADDITION AB NINETEEN NINETY FIVE WOULD ELIMINATE COPAYMENTS AS THERE IS NO FINANCIAL OR POLICY REASON TO KEEP IN STATUTE. COPAYMENTS ACT AS A POTENTIAL BARRIER TO CARE AND ARE CURRENTLY NOT ENFORCEABLE AND RARELY IF EVER COLLECTED BY PROVIDERS THIS BILL HAS NO KNOWN OPPOSITION AND URGE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU.

PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ACT AS YOU AND I BOTH SAID ON THOSE TYPES OF COMMITTEES. AND THAT MAKES IT HARD TO THAT YOU KNOW FOR US WE HAVE TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS AND I KNOW TODAY IS A POLICY.

IS THERE'S PROBABLY A GOOD ANSWER IN THE LATTER PART OF YOUR DISCUSSION THERE AND THAT IS. THE SAVINGS WILL PROBABLY. BE RECOGNIZED. IN THE FACT THAT THERE'S A LOT OF UNCOLLECTIBLE SAID ARE.

ANYWAY I'M RUSTY STILL HAVE BEEN A RUSTY ALL DAY. SO SO THE MEASURE THE MOTION IS A DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WHAT I WOULD AYE WALDRON. AGUIAR-CURRY AGUIAR-CURRY AYE ARAMBULA AYE ARAMBULA AYE BIGELOW BIGELOW NOT VOTING CARILLO LARA MAIENSCHEIN MAYES MCCARTY NAZARIAN. OH I'M SORRY MCCARTY I. NAZARIAN RIVAS RODRIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ ICE SANTIAGO. HI FIVE WILL HAVE WILL BE BELIEVING YOUR BILL ON CALL DOCTOR REGULAR- THIS BOERNER HORVATH- THE RUMOR THAT YOU WERE GONNA LET TALK MR LEVINE- FORCES CORRECT. YOU'RE SERIOUS- OKAY. WELL IT SO IT'S NOT REALLY RIVER THAN MR LEVINE PLEASE COME FOR. IT'S ALMOST NOT BELIEVABLE UNLESS IT COMES FROM THE NUMBER THAT WHILE SHE WAS SITTING RIGHT THERE AND YOU KNOW RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT. GOOD pMEMBERS I WANT TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND THINKING THE CHAIR AND ALSO YOUR STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS ISSUE NOT JUST ON THIS BILL BUT- ON THIS ISSUE THAT GOES BACK MANY YEARS- THANK YOU AND I RECOGNIZE THAT EFFORT. AB TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY THREE WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR LONG TERM CARE RESIDENTS WITH MEDICAL COVERAGE TO RETURN HOME. WHEN THEY'RE READY AND HAVE A HOME TO RETURN TO. MEDICAL PROVIDES COVERAGE TO LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS FOR NURSING HOME CARE. HOWEVER INDIVIDUALS WITH MEDIC CAL IN LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES ARE AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR HOMES. BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF THEIR INCOME IS PAID FOR A SHARE OF THE COST TO THE NURSING HOME. NURSING HOME RESIDENTS HALLMARK LONG TERM CARE MEDICARE MUST PAY A MONTHLY SHARE OF COST EQUAL. THEY'RE GROSSLY MONTHLY INCOME AND ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO KEEP PERSONAL AN INCIDENTAL NEEDS ALLOWANCE. OF THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS PER MONTH. THESE PATIENTS MAY QUALIFY FOR A LITTLE KNOWN MEDIKAL DEDUCTION CALLED THE HOME UPKEEP ALLOWANCE. THE H. U. A. ENABLES THE PERSON TO KEEP TWO HUNDRED NINE DOLLARS A MONTH OF THEIR INCOME FOR THE MAINTENANCE AND UPKEEP OF THEIR HOME. WHILE THEY ARE TEMPORARILY RESIDING IN THE NURSING HOME OR OTHER MEDICAL FACILITY. THEY THREE CAN BE ALLOWED FOR UP TO A SIX MONTH PERIOD. FROM THE DATE THE PERSON ENTERS THE FACILITY HOWEVER. HUNDRED NINE DOLLARS- IN AMOUNT HAS NOT BEEN CHANGED IN DECADES THE ALLOWANCE AMOUNT IS INADEQUATE TO PAY. THE RENT OR MORTGAGE ANOTHER COST NEEDED TO ACTUALLY MAINTAIN A HOME OR APARTMENT. AND AVAILABILITY OF THIS OPTION IS NOT WIDELY KNOWN THIS RESULTS IN PEOPLE. THING IN NURSING HOMES INDEFINITELY BECAUSE THEY LOSE THEIR HOME. AND ARE UNABLE TO TRANSITION BACK TO THE COMMUNITY. THIS BILL. WILL MAKE THE H. U. A. A MEANINGFUL BENEFIT. BY INCREASING THE AMOUNT TO THE ACTUAL MINIMUM COST OF MAINTAINING THE HOME INCLUDING MORTGAGE. PROPERTY TAXES UTILITY AND REQUIRED INSURANCE. THE BILL WOULD ALSO IMPROVE PUBLIC AWARENESS OFTHE PROGRAM TO INCREASE PARTICIPATION BY REQUIRING THE STATE TO PUBLICIZE THE H. UA. AND ESTABLISH A CLEAR APPLICATION PROCESS WITH THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THIS BILL WOULD ALSO CREATE A TRANSITIONAL NEEDS ALLOWANCE. TO ALLOW A PARTY TO ASSIST PEOPLE LIVING IN LONG TERM TERM CARE FACILITIES. WHO DO NOT HAVE A HOME TO RETURN TO. AFFORD A HOME IN THEIR COMMUNITY. AND LEAVE LONG TERM CARE. WHEN THEY ARE READY. THIS BENEFIT HAS NOT BEEN INCREASED IN FAR TOO LONG AND DOES NOT REFLECT CALIFORNIA'S COST OF LIVING. THIS BILL IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIANS HAVE HOMES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES TO RETURN TO. WHEN EXITING CARE. AND I HAVE TO- AMAZING WITNESSES NEXT TO ME- TO SPEAK TO THIS POINT I'VE SWAYED ASYLUMS FROM DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. AND BELA YOU GUN CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM. THANK YOU PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE WHITE SEA AGAIN ON DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. TRYING TO GET USED TO THIS NEW SET UP- SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES RECEIVING REHABILITATION OR CARE AND NURSING FACILITIES ARE AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR HOMES AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE WAS SHARING. I'M THERE ARE SEVERAL PROBLEMS WITH THE CURRENT HOME UPKEEP ALLOWANCE ONE IT'S ONLY TWO HUNDRED AND NINE DOLLARS A MONTH AN AMOUNT UNCHANGED SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. IT'S TOTALLY INSUFFICIENT FOR THE COST OF LIVING IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO. TO THE AVAILABILITY OF THE ALLOWANCE IS NOT WIDELY KNOWN. AND THREE THE ALLOWANCE DOES NOT CURRENTLY HELP PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES WHILE IN A FACILITY. OR ENTERED A FACILITY WHEN THEY WERE AND HOUSE BUT WANT TO FIND A NEW HOME AND LEAVE THE FACILITY. I ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY THREE MAKES THE HOME UPKEEP ALLOWANCE A MORE EFFECTIVE SUPPORT OPTION. BY DOING A FEW THINGS ONE IT INCREASES THE AMOUNT TO THE ACTUAL MINIMUM COST OF MAINTAINING A HOME. INCLUDING MORTGAGE RENT TO PROPERTY TAXES UTILITIES AND REQUIRED INSURANCE TOO IT ALLOWS PEOPLE AYE INSTITUTIONALIZED FOR LONGER THAN SIX MONTHS WHO LOST THEIR HOMES OR NEVER HAD A HOME TO BEGIN WITH TO ACCESS. TRANSITIONAL NEEDS ALLOWANCE- AND THREE REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO PUBLICIZE THE H. AWAY TO NURSING HOME RESIDENTS PERSPECTIVE RESIDENTS DISCHARGE PLANNERS AND MEDICAL OFFICES. I JUST TO CLOSE THE COBIT NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAD A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AS WE KNOW- ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY THREE PROVIDES A PATH OUT OF INSTITUTIONAL CARE- AND THE ATTENDANT RISKS FOR DEATH. DEATH AND ILLNESS FROM KOBE NINETEEN. IN ADDITION ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY THREE WILL FURTHER THE GOALS OF THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING HELPING TO ENSURE THAT SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES CAN LIVE IN THEIR HOMES AND COMMUNITIES SAFELY. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AN AYE VOTE SO THAT CALIFORNIA CAN CONTINUE TO DEMONSTRATE OUR LEADERSHIP IN CREATING A ROBUST HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES STEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXTER WITNESS PLEASE THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE- AGAIN M. BAILEY AGAIN I AM A AND THE LONG TERM CARE ADVOCATE THE CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM. AS PART OF MY WORK I PROVIDE COUNSELING TO SENIORS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES ABOUT MEDIC CAL IN LONG TERM CARE OPTIONS. ON AB TWENTY TWENTY THREE AIMS TO PREVENT MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES WHO HAVE ENTERED A NURSING HOME FOR SHORT TERM STAYS FROM LOSING THEIR HOMES BY INCREASING THE HOME UPKEEP ALLOWANCE FROM TWO HUNDRED NINE DOLLARS TO THE ACTUAL MINIMUM COST OF MAINTAINING A HOME. AS WELL AS ESTABLISHING A TRANSITIONAL NEEDS ALLOWANCE- CAN I RECEIVED A CALL LAST WEEK FROM MISS TAN THE DAUGHTER OF AN EIGHTY YEAR OLD WOMAN WHO HAD RECENTLY FALLEN AT HOME BROKEN HER LEG IN AN- IN HOME FOR REHABILITATION. THE DOCTOR TOLD MISS TAN THAT HER MOTHER WOULD LIKELY RETURN HOME IN ABOUT FIVE MONTHS HER MOTHER LIVES IN AN AFFORDABLE SENIOR HOUSING APARTMENT AND PAYS ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH IN RENT. AS A NURSING HOME RESIDENT A LONG TERM CARE MEDIKAL SHE MUST PAY HER ENTIRE MONTHLY INCOME AS A SHARE OF COST KEEPING ONLY THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS AS A PERSONAL NEEDS ALLOWANCE. ADDING IN THE CURRENT HOME OF PEOPLE- AND SHE IS ONLY LEFT WITH TWO HUNDRED FORTY FOUR DOLLARS TO PAY HER RENT AND UTILITIES AND IS AT RISK OF. FOR EVICTION AND THAT. BUT TEN A TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY THREE WOULD ENSURE HER MOTHER HAS A HOME TO RETURN TO AND SHE IMPROVES. INSTEAD OF FACING HOMELESSNESS OR PERMANENT INSTITUTIONALIZATION. INCREASING THE HOME UPKEEP ALLOWANCE SO THAT SHE CAN KEEP HER. INCOME TO PAY RENT AND UTILITIES WILL ALLOW MISS TOWNS MOTHER TO TRANSITION HOME AND UTILIZE LESS COSTLY SERVICES SUCH AS IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. OR PACE PROGRAM INSTEAD OF REMAINING IN IN AN EXPENSIVE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE. CLEARLY AB TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY THREE IS IT MORE COST EFFECTIVE AND EQUITABLE ALTERNATIVE FOR BOTH THE TAXPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA. AND FOR THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES WHO FACE LOSING THEIR HOMES WHEN THEY ENTER A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY FOR SHORT TERM STAY. HERE I VOTE ON AB TWENTY TWENTY THREE SHOWS A COMMITMENT TO SUPPORTING SENIORS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES TO RETURN HOME. AND DECREASE INSTITUTIONALIZATION THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
