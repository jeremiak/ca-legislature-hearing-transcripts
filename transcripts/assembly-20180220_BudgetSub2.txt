OR TWO LAPTOP NINETY EIGHT EDUCATION SO FOR K. TWELVE SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES CERTAINLY WE SAW A LOT OF. AT EFFORTS AND INITIATIVES AND AND THOSE FRONTS. UC AND CSU AND MINIMAL INCREASES WHICH ARE CONCERNING WILL ADDRESS THOSE AS WELL AS MINIMAL INCREASES IN OUR. STUDENT AID. PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES PIECE THERE ARE A FEW HIGH PROFILE PROPOSALS WILL START THE DISCUSSIONS TODAY. I KNOW THERE ARE. MANY QUESTIONS AND FRANKLY MANY MORE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS RELATED TO SOME OF THOSE PROPOSALS I WILL. ADD BEGIN THAT. DISCUSSION TODAY ABA WITH WITH THAT WE WILL AND I BEGIN THESE PROCEEDINGS ANY OPENING. AYE COMMENTS FOR MISTER O'DONNELL MISTER VOEPEL. A SEEING NINE WE WILL START BY BRINGING UP THEIR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN THE LA OPEN TO GIVE US AN OVERVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S. BUDGET PROPOSALS WE'LL START WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PASSAGE OF PROP THIRTY IN TWENTY. THE BUDGET PROPOSES TOTAL. RE POINT SEVEN BILLION FOR HIGHER EDUCATION IT'S MADE UP OF APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION GENERAL FUND AND LOCAL PROPERTY TAXES AND APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN POINT TWO BILLION. OF OTHER FUNDS AT THIS TOTAL REFLECTS BOTH FUNDING I'D. AT DIRECTLY TO THE PUBLIC SEGMENTS AND FUNDING OF FOR FINANCIAL AID THAT STUDENTS MAY USE AT ELIGIBLE INSTITUTIONS. SINCE TWENTY TWELVE WITH AND WITH THE INCREASES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FUNDING FOR THE UC WILL HAVE GROWN BY ONE POINT TWO BILLION FOR THE CSU BY ONE POINT SIX BILLION AND FOR THE COMMUNICATIVE BY TWO POINT FOUR BILLION. THE ADMINISTRATION SUPPORTS CONTINUED INVESTMENT HIGHER EDUCATION WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WILL WORK TOGETHER TO IMPLEMENT NEW AND CREATIVE PRACTICES THAT CONSIDER COST OF INSTRUCTION. TO BETTER SUPPORT STUDENT SUCCESS AND COMPLETION AND TO EXPAND ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION FOR MORE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. WHAT THIS ALL DESCRIBE THE GOVERNOR'S BY BUDGET PROPOSED INVESTMENTS FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND HOW THOSE INVESTMENTS REALLY TIGHT BACK TO THIS SCHOOL OF AND ACCESS WITH SUCCESS? SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES NINE POINT TWO BILLION IN FUNDING FOR COMMUNICATIVE AS AN ADULT EDUCATION WHEN ACCOUNTING FOR AVAILABLE PROP MAYBE GENERAL FUNDS A LOCAL REVENUES AND FEES. I THIS FUNDING SUPPORTS GENERAL PURPOSE APPORTIONMENT AND NUMEROUS CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS. BEFORE I DESCRIBE IT THE SPENDING PROPOSAL IS I WANT TO BRIEFLY HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE RECENT INITIATIVES AND DEVELOPMENTS OF THE COMMUNICATIVE DRESS. POTS TO HELP FRAME IN THE INVESTMENTS OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THE STATE HAS MADE VARIOUS INVESTMENTS IN RECENT YEARS TO IMPROVE STUDENT SUCCESS THIS INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION FOR THE STUDENT SUCCESS AND SUPPORT PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES UP PLANNING AND SERVICES TO MATRICULATE AT STUDENTS. AND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE MILLION. FOR EQUITY PLANS TO MITIGATE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON ACCESS AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS AS WELL AS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME FUNDING TO DEVELOP GUIDED PATHWAYS UP PROGRAMS WHICH ARE INTEGRATED INSTITUTION WIDE. APPROACHES FOCUSED ON STUDENT SUCCESS. AND FINALLY I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT. A RECENT DEVELOPMENT AT THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES AND JULY TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE BOARD OF STRATEGIC PLAN THE VISION FOR SUCCESS TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATIVE STUDENT SUCCESS. AND THE PLAN CALLS FOR THE SYSTEM TO MEET SPECIFIC GOALS TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE COMPLETION TRANSFER RATES TO DECREASE ACCESS UNITS TAKEN BY STUDENTS. AND TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. STUDENTS WHO ARE EMPLOYED IN THEIR FEEL LESS OF STUDYING AS WAS TO ELIMINATE EQUITY GAPS AND ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. PROPOSED INVESTMENTS REALLY FOCUS ON A BATH AND THEN THEME AT THE SYSTEMS NEW STRATEGIC PLAN AND BUILD UPON THE INVESTMENTS INCIDENTS CASSETTES OF THE PRIOR YEARS. SO I WANNA START BY TALKING ABOUT. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR A NEW STUDENT CENTERED UP FUNDING FORMULA FOR GENERAL PURPOSE APPORTIONMENT. SO THE EXISTING FUNDING. FOR GENERAL PURPOSE APPORTIONMENT SET UP FOR THE COMMUNITY HALL EDGES IS BASED ON A ROMANCE OF FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS. THIS CAUSES DISTRICTS TO PRIORITIZE AND ROAMING GROWTH AND CREATE SIGNIFICANT HARDSHIPS FOR DISTRICTS THAT ARE DECLINING ENROLLMENTS. FURTHER THAT'S A ROMAN BASED. APPORTIONMENT FUNNY MODEL DOES NOT A PROPERLY REFLECT THAT GOALS OF THE VISION FOR SUCCESS OR IN THE STATE'S PRIORITIES TO BETTER SERVE STUDENTS TO ELIMINATE. AYE UNTIL THE MADE EQUITY GAPS GIVEN THAT IT'S ONLY REWARDS ENROLLMENT WITHOUT ANY OTHER CONSIDERATION FOR STUDENT SUCCESS METRICS. TO BETTER INCENTIVE AND REWARD STUDENT SUCCESS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES A NEW FUNDING FORMULA AND THERE ARE THREE COMPONENTS TO THAT FUNDING FORMULA. APPROXIMATELY FIFTY PERCENT OF THE FUNDS WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED TO DISTRICTS THROUGH A BASE CRAP AND THAT'S BASED ON A ROMANCE A VERY SIMILAR TO THE EXISTING. I HAVE FUNDING FORMULA AS A WAY TO REALLY PROTECT AND ACCESS. TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE FUNDS WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED TO DO TO DISTRICTS THROUGH A SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT THAT WOULD BE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS THAT THE DISTRICT A ROLES. AND THEN TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE FUNDS WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH A STUDENT SUCCESS GRANT BASED ON THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS RECEIVE A DEGREE OR CERTIFICATE AND THE NUMBER STUDENTS WHO COMPLETE. THEIR DEGREE CERTIFICATE OR TRANSFER IN THREE YEARS OR LESS. ADDITIONALLY THE STUDENT SUCCESS INCENTIVE GRAB WHAT INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR EACH ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER GRANTED BY THE COLLEGE AS A WAY TO FURTHER AND SENT THAT SEAMLESS TRANSFER. THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO BALANCE THE NEED TO MAINTAIN ACCESS WHILE PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO ENCOURAGE ACCESS FOR UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS. AND REWARDING COLLEGES PROGRESS ON IMPROVING STUDENT SUCCESS. WE ALSO THINK THAT THAT PROPOSED FUNDING FORMULA WOULD AT GREATER FISCAL STABILITY TO THE COLLEGES BUDGET SINCE I MOVED AWAY FROM A MODEL THAT'S JUST BASS ARE A MOMENT. WE KNOW THAT WHEN ECONOMIC TIMES ARE GOOD COMMITTEE COLLEGE REMAINS FLAT OR DECLINES. OUT WHICH IS WHAT MANY COLLEGES ARE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING THIS PROPOSAL CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR COLLEGES TO GROW FISCALLY AT THREE. AT A BY IMPROVING ONS SPECIFIC STUDENT SUCCESS METRICS. TO SUPPORT THE DISTRICT TRANSITION TO THE NEW AS A STUDENT CENTER FUNDING FORMULA THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION PROPOSITION. GENERAL FUND TO ENSURE THAT NO DISTRICT RECEIVES AT LESS RELATIVE TO THE EXISTING FUNDING FORMULA. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES A HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE POINT TWO MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR TWO POINT FIVE ONE COSTS LIVING ADJUSTMENT. TO APPORTIONMENT AND SIXTY MILLION PROP NINETY EIGHT UP GENERAL FUND FOR WILL PRESENT GROWTH AND ACCESS IS SO THESE FUNDS WILL BE BUILT INTO AT THE BASE RESOURCES OF THE NEW APPORTIONMENT FORMULA. TO INCREASE ACCESS TO A POPULATION OF WORKING ADULTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY NOT ACCESSING COMMITTEE COLLEGESTHE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO PROPOSES HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME IN TWENTY MILLION ON GOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. TO DEVELOP OF AN ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. I THERE ARE CURRENTLY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS IN THE PRIME WORKING AGE IS BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND THIRTY FOUR WILL ONLY HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR SOME COLLEGE BUT NO DEGREE. AND WARREN LOW PAYING JOBS THE FOCUS OF THE COLLEGE WOULD BE TO PROVIDE SHORT TERM CERTIFICATES AND STACKABLE CREDENTIALS WITH LABOR MARKET VALUE. TO HELP THIS POPULATION HAVE BETTER. EDUCATIONAL AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES. KEY FEATURES OF THE COLLEGE WHICH I KNOW WILL DISCUSS IT FURTHER DETAIL I'M INCLUDE IF FLEXIBLE COURSE SCHEDULING AND START TIMES NOT TIED TO THE TYPICAL ACADEMIC CALENDAR AND. COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION I RECOGNIZE THIS PRIOR LEARNING AND SPECIALIZED SUPPORT SERVICES INCLUDING ON ON DEMAND SUPPORT SERVICES SIDE. AT TIMES LATE AT NIGHT OR ON THE WEEKENDS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO PROPOSALS PROPOSE A SEVERAL INVESTMENTS TO MAINTAIN AFFORDABILITY AND FOR THEIR SUPPORT STUDENTS ABILITY TO GRADUATE IN A TIMELY WAY. THE BUDGET PROPOSES FORTY SIX MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE ARE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WHICH AUTHORIZES DISTRICTS TO WAIVE. FEES FOR ALL FIRST TIME FULL TIME STUDENTS OR SPEND THE FUNDS FOR OTHER PURPOSES TO ADVANCE SPECIFY STUDENT SUCCESS SCHOOLS. THE BUDGET ALSO PROPOSES THIRTY TWO POINT NINE MILLION TO CONSOLIDATE THE FULL TIME STUDENT SUCCESS GRANT AND THE COMPLETION GRANT EITHER TO FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS THAT TARGET THE SAME SOCIO ECONOMIC. A STUDENT COHORT BUT HOW DIFFERENT I REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING DIFFERENT UNIT LOADS. SO THE BUDGET PROPOSES TO CONSOLIDATE CONSOLIDATE THOSE TWO PROGRAMS SHIP TRIP PER UNIT GRANT AMOUNTS AND ALSO AUGMENT THE UNDERLYING GRANTS TO PROVIDE MORE COST OF ATTENDANCE FINANCIAL AID FOR STUDENTS. I'M GOING TO HELL I'D AS AT THE PROPOSALS FOR THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS I SPECIFICALLY THE BUDGET PROPOSES THIRTY POINT SIX MILLION ONE TIME PROP PROPOSITION NINETY GENERAL FUND. TO FUND SHORTFALLS IN RELATED AND SUPPLEMENTAL INSTRUCTION REIMBURSEMENTS IN PRIOR YEARS. AS WELL AS SEVENTEEN POINT EIGHT ON GOING TO REIMBURSE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS FOR THE ESTIMATED AND STRUCTURAL INSTRUCTIONAL HOURS AT IN YOU RELATED AND SUPPLEMENTARY STRUCTURING. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES TWENTY MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT IT AROUND OF INNOVATION AWARDS. AT THIS PROGRAM WILL HAVE IT WOULD HAVE A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON FUNDING INNOVATIONS THAT CLOSE EQUITY COLLAPSE INCLUDING REGIONAL ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. I'M TO HELP ADVANCE THOSE SCHOOLS AND THE VISION FOR SUCCESS. AND FINALLY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE POINT TWO MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND INSTRUCTIONAL APPOINTMENT. AND INCLUDES FIVE NEW PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE BOND FUNDED PROJECTS. I'M THINKING AND WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW FOR THAT UNIVERSITIES. SURE ALL BEGIN WITH UNIVERSITIES CONSISTENT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN MAY REVISION BUCKET SUMMARY THE GOVERNORSHIP GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES A THREE PERCENT. OF BASS INCREASE FOR BOTH THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THIS REPRESENTS AN INCREASE OF NINETY TWO POINT ONE MILLION GENERAL FUND. FOR EACH OF THE STE UP THE CSU ON THE AND THE YOU SEE. THE U. SKIRT THE CSU REPORTS AND ROLLING ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS UNDER TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. THE TWENTY EIGHT TO NINETEEN BUDGET PROPOSES APPROXIMATELY THREE POINT FIVE BILLION GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE CSU. INCLUDED IN THIS AMOUNT IS THE NINE THE PREVIOUSLY NOTED NINETY TWO POINT ONE MILLION GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION. THE ADMINISTRATION GENERALLY EXPECTS THAT THESE FUNDS WOULD BE USED BY THE CSU TO SUPPORT ITS ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE. AS YOU MAY RECALL THE CSU GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY SIXTEEN. COMMITS THE UNIVERSITY TRAINED VICIOUS GRADUATION GOALS INCREASING THE FOR YOUR RATE O AT LEAST FORTY PERCENT INCREASING THE TO YOUR TRANSFER RATE. TO LEAST FORTY FIVE PERCENT AND CLOSING GAPS IN OUTCOMES BETWEEN THE TARGET OF STUDENTS AND THEIR PEERS. THE TEN UC CAMPUSES AND ROLL TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS WITH ANOTHER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS ENROLLED IN THEIR EXTENSION PROGRAMS. THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET PROPOSES APPROXIMATELY THREE POINT FIVE BILLION IN GENERAL FUND RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. INCLUDED IN THIS AMOUNT IS THE PREVIOUSLY NOTED NINETY TWO POINT ONE MILLION GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION FOR THE UNIVERSITY. THE BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES TEN MILLION GENERAL FUND IN RECOGNITION OF REVISED PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX REVENUE SUPPORTING GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION. THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO MONITOR PROGRESS TOWARD MEETING THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE UC. UP REFLECTED IN THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN SPECIFICALLY THE BUDGET ACT TWENTY SEVENTEEN CONDITION THE RELEASE OF FIFTY MILLION GENERAL FUND. BASED UPON THE U. T. ACHIEVING CERTAIN I COMMITMENTS. DOES INCLUDE ACHIEVING COMMITMENTS MADE THEN THE AGREEMENT WITH THE GOVERNOR RELATED TO ACTIVITY BASED COSTING. AND TARGET MOMENT OF TRANSFER STUDENTS. ADOPTING RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE STATE AUDITOR. HA TO ADD TO THE UC BOARD OF REGENTS ON THE U. COPD. ELIMINATING CERTAIN BENEFITS FOR YOU SEE SENIOR MANAGERS AND COMMITTING TO DISCLOSE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AS PART OF THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS. IN TERMS OF TUITION BOTH SEGMENTS OF NOW CONSIDER TUITION INCREASES FOR THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR. THE BUDGET REITERATES THAT ANY TUITION INCREASES MUST BE MADE ONLY IN THE CONTEXT OF REDUCING OVERALL. MUST BE MADE IN THE CONTEXT OF REDUCING THE OVERALL COST STRUCTURE YOU SEE AN IMPROVING THEIR GRADUATION RATES AT CSU. TUITION INCREASES WITHOUT THESE IMPROVEMENTS WOULD ONLY BURDEN FAMILIES WHAT THE COST OF AN INEFFICIENT SYSTEM. ANY INCREASES WOULD ALSO HAVE IMPACTS ON THE STATE BUDGET. SPECIFICALLY THE INCREASE OF THE GOVERNOR THE GOVERNING BOARDS ARE CONSIDERING WOULD GROW CAL GRANT COSTS FOR YOU SEE STUDENTS BY OVER TWENTY MILLION. ANNUALLY AND FORCE CSU STUDENTS BY OVER TWENTY MILLION ANNUALLY COMMENCING IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. BEYOND THE COSTS THAT ARE REFLECTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. WITHOUT WILL CLOSE AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO HAVE TURNED. THANK YOU HELLO. AND JENNIFER CAN LEAD TO ANALYST'S OFFICE I YOU SHOULD HAVE A COPY OF OUR REPORT WE HAVE RELEASED ANNOUNCES OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS LAST WEEK. I'M GONNA SPEAK FROM IT JUST HIGHLIGHT A FEW POINTS FROM IT. I'M GONNA KEEP MY COMMENTS HIGHER LEVEL RECOGNIZING YOU GO THROUGH ON THE SPECIFIC ISSUES AND COMING HEARINGS. IT'S GONNA START WITH A FEW COMMENTS ON THE HIGHER AND LANDSCAPE MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS ON THE UNIVERSITY IS A COUPLE COMMENTS ON THE COLLEGE AS. SO STARTING WITH SOME COMMENTS ON ELVES ABILITY TO GO TO UC AND CSU. SINCE THE MASTER PLAN IN NINETEEN SIXTY WAS ADOPTED THE STATE'S CONDUCTED ELEVEN OUNCE ABILITY STUDIES. ON THE STUDY IS. IF YOU LOOK AT FIGURE TO PAGE SIX YOU CAN SEE THE RESULTS OF ALL OF THOSE STUDIES FIRST YOSHIO. THE INTENT OF THE STUDY IS AGAIN ONCE TO SYRIA UC AND CSU FOR THEIR FRESHMAN ADMITS FOR DRYING FROM WITHIN THE MASTER PLAN POOLS. THE MASTER PLAN SET UP PULLED BACK YOU SEE WOULD DROP FROM THE TOP ONE EIGHT COLLEGES COULD SEE IF SHE WOULD DROP FROM THE TOP THIRD. YOU CAN SEE IN NINETEEN SIXTY ONE ZERO SHE WAS TRYING FROM ABOVE THAT LEVEL AND ONE OF THEM AND TONS OF THE MASTER PLAN WAS TO TRY TO. ENCOURAGE YOUR STUDENTS TO GO DIRECTLY TO CSU MORE TO GO TO THE U. AT THE COLLEGES AND TRANSFER THERE AFTER. BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT SOMETIMES A COUPLE TIMES DURING THE EIGHTIES YES USE PULL WAS TOO SMALL. AND IT WAS LOOSENING ADMISSION CRITERIA AND RESPONSE WHERE YOU SEE IS TODAY UNDER THE MOST RECENT STUDY AS A FORTY ONE PERCENT SO ABOVE THE MASTER PLAN. GOALS. UC WAS FOUND TO BE A FOURTEEN PERCENT SO SOMEONE ABOVE THAT TWELVE AND A HALF PERCENT SIDE UNDER A MASTER PLAN. SO THE ISSUE AND THIS YEAR IS WHETHER THE STATE MAY UNIVERSITIES SHOULD ADJUST THEIR ADMISSION CRITERIA TO GET BACK TO THE MASTER PLAN ELIGIBILITY POOLS OR CHANGE THE MASTER PLAN ON STABILITY POOLS AND ALLOW BOTH THE UNIVERSITY SEGMENT SO REMAIN ABOUT THAT. IF YOU WERE TO GO BACK TO. THE MORE TRADITIONAL POOLS YOU WOULD HAVE THE OBVIOUS BENEFIT OF LOWER STATE COSTS LOWER STUDENT COSTS IF YOU EXPANDED THE POOL YOU WOULD HAVE THE OBVIOUS BENEFIT OF ALLOWING MORE STUDENTS TO GO DIRECTLY TO THE STATEMENTS. THERE'S TWO OTHER CONSIDERATIONS AMONGST MANY THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER. THE FIRST IS THAT. IS THINKING ABOUT TODAY IS GRADUATION EXPECTATIONS SO CALIFORNIA HAS THE COMMON CORE STATE STANDARDS MOST STATES DO CALIFORNIA'S ADOPTED IT IS USING THEM. UNDER THE COMMON CORE STATE STANDARDS EVERY HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE IS EXPECTED TO BE PREPARED FOR COLLEGE AND CAREER. YOU'VE HEARD PROBABLY ABOUT THE STATE'S SCHOOL DASHBOARD WE USE IT TO EVALUATE DISTRICT PERFORMANCE AS PART OF THAT DASHBOARD WE HAVE THE COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS INDICATOR. IT MEASURES THE SHARE OF THAT A DISTRICT STUDENTS THAT ARE PREPARED FOR COLLEGE AND CAREER APPROACHING PREPARED UNPREPARED. SO I THINK THE QUESTION ITS LAST WHETHER STUDENTS SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR COLLEGE AND CAREER AND MORE HOW DOES THE CALIFORNIA ONE A DESIGN THAT'S HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM AND TO WHAT EXTENT DOES IT WANT TO ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO DO THEIR LOWER DIVISION COURSEWORK AFTER COMMUNITY COLLEGES. OR ENCOURAGE THEM TO RURAL DIRECTLY AT YOU SEE ARE CSU. THE SECOND COMMENT SPAM FACTOR YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE IN MIND I KEEP IN MIND IS OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS THE STATE AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE MADE SUBSTANTIAL EFFORTS IMPROVE THE TRANSFER PATHWAY. IF YOU LOOK COMPETE JUST FORTY FIVE AND FORTY FOUR AND FORTY FIVE YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THAT NOW BUT WE GO AT LENGTH INTO THESE VARIOUS EFFORTS THAT THE STATE COLLEGES. HAVE MADE. I'M OF THOSE EFFORTS AGAIN ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR STUDENTS TO TRANSFER INCREASING THEIR LIKELIHOOD OF GETTING ACCEPTED INCREASING THEIR LIKELIHOOD OF GETTING OUT OF CSU WITHIN TWO YEARS OF ADDITIONAL WORK IN GETTING A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. SO CONSIDERABLE EFFORTS IN THOSE AREAS. SO TURNING TO ENROLLMENT. IF YOU LOOK AT FIGURE FOR PITCH AIDS. AND IT JUST SHOWS A GROWTH IN HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES. SO YOU CAN SEE THAT GROWTH IS SLOW IN IF YOU WERE TO LOOK FROM TWO THOUSAND TO TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. THE AVERAGE ANNUAL GROWTH WAS TWO POINT EIGHT PERCENT. IF YOU LOOK FROM TWO THOUSAND NINE TO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AT SLOW IN ZERO POINT SIX. AND. IF YOU LOOK OUT OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT NUMBER OF YEARS IT'S PROJECTED TO SLOW EVEN FURTHER TWO ZERO POINT THREE PERCENT. SO THIS I HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE THE LIKELIHOOD YOU'D SEE REQUESTS FROM UC AND CSU ASKING FOR NEW SPACE. YOU SEE ANSWER TO CLEARLY HAS AGING FACILITIES SO YOU'D EXPECT THE IT WAS CONTINUE TO SEE REQUESTS FOR RENEWAL AND RENOVATIONS BUT IT WOULD BE LESS LIKELY. THAT BASED UPON DEMOGRAPHIC GROWTH YOU'D BE SEEN I REQUEST FOR NEW CAPITAL. TURNING TO AFFORDABILITY. IF YOU LOOK AT FIGURE EIGHTS PAGE THIRTEEN. YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE COLLEGE'S FEW LEVELS ARE RATHER RELATIVE TO SOMEWHERE INSTITUTIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. YOU CAN SEE AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND CSU RATES IN CALIFORNIA ARE STILL NOTABLY LOWER THAN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. BUT COLLEGES THEIR TUITION LEVELS LESS THAN HALF OF THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. CSU IS LOWER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE BY SIXTEEN PERCENT THIS THE GUINNESS FIGURE EIGHT ON PAGE THIRTEEN. YOU SEE IN CONTRAST WAS HIGHER THAN THEIR AVERAGE OF SIMILAR INSTITUTIONS TWENTY ONE PERCENT HIGHER. IF YOU LOOK AT FIGURE NINE. PAGE FOURTEEN JUST THE NEXT PAGE YOU CAN SEE JUST HOW VOLATILE FEE LEVELS HAVE BEEN IN CALIFORNIA YOU CAN SEE YEARS OF STEEP INCREASE THOSE FOLLOWED BY FLAP PERIODS. THE STEEP INCREASES ARE DURING RECESSIONS ECONOMIC SLOWDOWNS TIMES WHEN FAMILIES ARE. LIKELY THEIR ECONOMIC SITUATIONS ARE SOMEWHAT MORE DIFFICULT YOU CONCEIVE FLAT PERIODS DURING THE ECONOMIC EXPANSIONS DURING PERIODS WHEN FAMILY'S ECONOMIC SITUATIONS TEND TO BE IMPROVING. WE'VE RECOMMENDED FOR YEARS THAT THE STATE HAVE A TUITION POLICY THAT WOULD WORK VERY DIFFERENTLY SO UNDER THE FEE POLICY THERE WOULD BE GRADUAL MODEST INCREASES DURING GOOD TIMES WHEN FAMILIES WAGES ARE LIKELY TO BE GOING UP SOMEWHAT. AND THEN IF THE STATE HOW TO RESERVE AND IF THERE WERE EVER A TIME WHERE RATES WOULD BE FLAT IT WOULD BE DURING RECESSIONS WHEN FAMILIES WHICH IS LIKELY WOULD NOT BE INCREASED IN ARE INCREASING AS MUCH. THAT COULD ONLY BE DONE AGAIN AT THE STATE WERE SITTING ON A HALF RESERVE. IF YOU HAVE. LOOK IT JUST FIGURE ELEVEN HERE ON THE FACING PAGE YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THE FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS THAT THE STATE HAS FOR UNDERGRADUATES. AND YOU CAN I AM I'M SORRY YOU CAN SEE FROM HERE THAT. CALIFORNIA HAS NUMBER OF AID PROGRAMS CONFERENCE IT PROGRAM SO ARE AMONGST THE MOST GENEROUS IN THE COUNTRY ARGUABLY THE MOST GENEROUS. IF YOU LOOK AT FIGURE TWELVE ON PAGE SIXTEEN YOU CAN SEE THAT THE AID PROGRAMS ARE LARGELY WORKING AS INTENDED. AND SO FOR EXAMPLE JUST LOOKING AT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE AS AT THE LOWEST INCOME FAMILY THOSE MAKING UNDER THIRTY THOUSAND. YOU CAN SEE THAT NOT PRICE FOR THIS FAMILY IS A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU CAN SEE AS FAMILY'S INCOME LEVELS GO UP THE NAP PRICE GOES UP. TO TRY TO GIVE YOU SOME CONTEXT FOR THIS COMMUNICATES STUDENT THEIR TUITION WOULD BE COVERED SO THE SIX THOUSAND WOULD BE ON MATT LIVING COSTS IF THE STUDENT WERE TO WORK FIFTEEN HOURS A WEEK DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR AND FULL TIME DURING THE SUMMER AT MINIMUM WAGE THAT MAKE. ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS TO JUST TO GIVE YOU A CONTEXT OF WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE. AT THE STUDENT LEVEL. SO MAKING JUST A COUPLE COMMENTS ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY IS AND THEN FINISHING WITH THAT COLLEGES. EVERY YEAR THE TO KEEP TO KEEP COST DRIVERS AMONG MANY ARE FOR USE INSTANCE YOUR EMPLOYEE COMPLICATE POLITELY. SO THINKING ABOUT EMPLOYEE COM. AND. IF YOU LOOK AT FIGURE EIGHTEEN ON PAGE TWENTY THREE. I MEAN YOU CAN SEE JUST A COMPARISON OF UC FULL PROFESSOR AVERAGE SALARIES COMPARED TO SOME SIMILAR INSTITUTIONS. I'M AYE BOTH YOU CA AND CSU THE MOST RECENT DATA SUGGESTING THAT SALARIES ARE STILL COMPETITIVE. THIS SHOWS THAT BEAR HIGHER THAN THAT FOR PUBLIC COMPARISON INSTITUTIONS VIRGINIA MICHIGAN BUFFALO URBANA CHAMPAIGN. AS WELL AS NOTABLY HIGHER THAN ALL SIMILAR PUBLIC RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I'M FIRST YES YOU THE MOST RECENT STUDY SHOWS THAT FACULTY SALARIES ARE AT SLIGHTLY ABOVE SIMILAR COMPARISON INSTITUTIONS. THE DATA WE ALSO HAVE ON WHETHER THE CAMPUSES ARE ABLE TO GET THEIR FIRST CHOICE CANDIDATE SHOW THAT IT STILL HIGH. THAT TURNOVER RATES ARE STILL VERY LOW. WHEN YOU LOOK AT. CS YOU HAVE FROM THE MID TWENTY SIXTEEN TO MED TWENTY NINETEEN AND YOU LOOK AT THEIR CONTRACTS THE CUMULATIVE GENERAL SALARY INCREASE THE SEVENTEEN POINT SIX PERCENT TAX YES YOU. SO NOTABLY ABOUT WHAT I'M SOME OTHER STATE EMPLOYEE GROUPS ARE RECEIVING. SO LOOKING AT CAPITAL OUTLAY. IF YOU I'D TURN TO FIGURE TWENTY EIGHT PAGE FORTY. I'M I'M SORRY I'M IT FIGURE TWENTY THREE ON PAGE TWENTY NINE STARTED TO SUCH A STRICT. SO ADAM IS SO I'M CAPITAL OUTLAY HERE WE JUST HAVE WE HAVE STE NOTABLE ISSUES WITH BOTH UC AND CSU IS CAPITAL OUTLAY REQUEST THEY WANNA JUST EMPHASIZE THREE. I'M OUR FIRST IS HAVING TO DO WITH THE JUSTIFICATION FOR NEW SPACE NORMALLY WHEN THE SEGMENTS WHAT'S THE MET AND REQUEST YOU FOR NEW SPACE. THEY WERE TOLD TELL YOU HOW MUCH OF EXISTING SPACE IS BEING USED THEY WOULD THINK ABOUT SUMMER AND TO THE EXTENT THEY'RE USING SOME ARE. AYE WE DIDN'T GET THAT KIND OF QUALITY BACK UP THIS YEAR. AND WHEN IT COMES TO JUSTIFY A NEW FACILITIES WHEN YOU LOOK AT UC SYSTEM WIDE THERE'S NOTABLE EXISTING ON YOU'D SPACE WHEN YOU LOOK AT MOST CSU CAMPUSES PARTICULARLY ACCOUNTING FOR SOME ARE. THERE'S NOTABLE EXISTING CAPACITY. OUR SECOND NOTABLE CONCERN IS WITH CONSTRUCTION COSTS SO HERE IF YOU LOOK AT FIGURE TWENTY THREE ON PAGE TWENTY NINE. UC HAS SUBMITTED REQUESTS FOR FOR NEW ACADEMIC BUILDINGS. YOU CAN SEE THAT THE AVERAGE COST PER ASSIGNABLE SQUARE FOOT IS VARYING FROM A LOW OF SEVEN HUNDRED ROUGHLY AT SAN DIEGO TO FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PER SQUARE FOOT AT SANTA CRUZ. THE DIFFERENCE IS NOT BEEN EXPLAINED BY THE TYPE OF SPACE SO THIS IS PRIMARILY A CLASSROOM SPACE FACULTY OFFICE SPACE. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS CSU HAD CONSTRUCTION COSTS GUIDELINES OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THEY STILL INTERNALLY HAVE CONSTRUCTION COSTS GUIDELINES WE DID AN EXTENSIVE REVIEW BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO OF THOSE. GUIDELINES AND CONCLUDED THEY WERE REASONABLE. ALL WE DID THIS TIME IS TAKE THE CALIFORNIA CONSTRUCTION COST INDEX AN UPDATE THOSE IF YOU WERE TO DO THAT THE GOING RATE FOR A CLASSROOM WOULD BE FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS PER SQUARE FOOT. IF YOU DID A FOR OFFICE SPACE A BEFORE HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE DOLLARS PER SQUARE FOOT. SO THESE RATES ARE NOTABLY HIGHER. JUST AS A REMINDER OF THE GOVERNOR WHEN THEY TRIED THIS NEW CAP OUTLAY SYSTEM OF COLLAPSING CAPITOL IN SUPPORT DID SO WITH THE HOPE THAT IT WOULD MAKE THE TRADE OFF BETWEEN CAPITAL AND SUPPORT MORE OBVIOUS. AND THAT IT WOULD CONSTRUCT CONTROL CONSTRUCTION COSTS. AND THAT'S CLEARLY NOT WHAT WE'VE BEEN SEEN AT ANY OF THE SEGMENT SINCE THE STATE STARTED THE NEW SYSTEM. AND WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT CHANGES AND SCOPE AND COST AND. SO IF YOU LOOK AT NOW FIGURE TWENTY EIGHT PAGE FORTY. THE STATE LAST YEAR PROVE SEVERAL CSU PROJECTS AND SEE IF SHE WASN'T ABLE TO PROCEED WITH THE PROJECTS AND IN SOME INSTANCES RESUBMITTED THE PROJECTS FOR THIS YEAR. YOU CAN SEE HERE ON FIGURE TWENTY EIGHT JUST FOR AN EXAMPLE NORTHRIDGE CAMPUS LAST YEAR SUBMITTED A PROPOSAL FOR RENOVATION BUILDING THAT WOULD COST FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND THIS YEAR IS ASKING FOR A NEW BUILDING THAT WOULD COST A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AND THE SAN BERNADINE NOPE CAMPUS LAST YEAR CAME IN ASKING FOR A NEW BUILDING AT SIXTY SEVEN MILLION AS ASKING THIS YEAR FOR AND A RENOVATED BUILDING AN ADDITION OF A HUNDRED AND ELEVEN MILLION. WHETHER IT BE JUSTIFICATION FOR NEW SPACE CONSTRUCTION COSTS PER SQUARE FOOT OR SCOPE AND COST CHANGES THESE ARE NOT KINDS OF. ISSUES WE WOULD HAVE SEEN AS NOTABLY UNDER THE OLD SYSTEM SO WE THINK THESE ARE ALL. A REALLY SERIOUS SIGNALS OF A PROBLEM WITH THE NEW SYSTEM. BECAUSE OF THE CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSALS THAT WE GOT WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT THE STATEMENTS REVISIT THEM RESUBMIT THEM TO USE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE BETTER JUSTIFICATION ON BEFORE YOU PROCEED FORWARD. IF YOU DON'T GET BETTER JUSTIFICATION I'M WORSE ADJUSTING THAT FIRST ISSUE FOR EXAMPLE THESE PROJECTS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO DO ARE ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASE IN DEBT SERVICE COSTS OF ABOUT THIRTEEN MILLION. IF YOU'RE NOT SATISFIED THE BUT THE REQUEST YOU WOULD TAKE THAT THIRTEEN MILLION A REPURPOSE THAT FOR HIGHER. UP PRIORITIES WITHIN YOUR BUDGET. AB SO I GET AGAIN BECAUSE THE COSTS HAVE BEEN SO HIGH AND BECAUSE THE SCOPE AND COST CHANGES HAPPEN SO NOTABLE WE HAVE. A PARTICULARLY SERIOUS CONCERNS THE SHARE. SO FINALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE COLLEGES YOU'VE HEARD LOTS ABOUT THE ONLINE COLLEGE PROPOSAL LOTS ABOUT THE APPORTIONMENT FUNDING PROPOSAL I'LL JUST SHARE OFFICES GENERAL FEEDBACK. ON BOTH SO WHEN IT COMES TO THE APPORTIONMENT FORMULA AYE WE THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO TRY OUT DOING LAST IN A APPORTIONMENT FUNDING BASED ON ENROLLMENT SOME PORTION BASED ON PERFORMANCE. THIRTY OTHER STATES HAVE SOME MONEY LINKED TO PERFORMANCE BASED FUNDING. THOSE STATES THAT DO RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT IT DOES CHANGE COLLEGE BEHAVIOR THEY DO THINGS LIKE HIGHER MORE TUTORS HIRE MORE ADVISERS FOCUS MORE ON BASIC SKILLS INSTRUCTION TRY TO STREAMLINE COURSE ARTICULATION. THERE IS LIMITED DATA TODAY THAT SUGGESTS STUDENT OUTCOMES IMPROVE NOTABLY BUT IT'S SO COULD BE WORTH TRYING SAID GET COLLEGES TO START DOING THOSE THINGS IF YOU WERE TO DEEMED THAT POSITIVE THINGS. IF YOU DO PROCEED DOWN THE ROAD OF PLACING SOME MONEY I'M MORE OF IT BASED UPON PERFORMANCE WE JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO LINK IT DIRECTLY AT LEAST A SMALL PORTION OF IT OR SOME PORTION OF IT. TO HOW LOW INCOME UNLESS PREPARED STUDENTS PERFORM NOT JUST ON ROLLING THEM BUT GETTING THEM TO SUCCEED WITH DEGREES IN A TIMELY FASHION. FINALLY ON THE ONLINE COLLEGE JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION WHAT IT REALLY BELIEVES ARE THE ROOT CAUSES OF THE WORD THE ROOT ISSUE US. I WHY ISN'T THAT ADULTS WORKING ADULTS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE OPTIONS THAT THEY WANT WITH AN EXISTING COLLEGE SYSTEM TODAY. I'M A WHY IS IT THAT THEY'RE NOT AVAILING THEMSELVES OF OPTIONS WHAT PARTICULAR OPTIONS WHAT THEY LIKE. WE THINK ONCE YOU HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEM YOU'RE TRYING TO TARGET THE ROOT CAUSES OF THOSE PROBLEMS YOU COULD CONSIDER. OTHER SOLUTIONS SOLUTIONS MAYBE EVEN WITHIN THE EXISTING SYSTEM HAVING SAID THAT IT COULD BE HARD TO CHANGE THE INCENTIVES OF THE EXISTING SYSTEM YOU MIGHT HAVE TO ASK YOURSELVES WHY. WHY AREN'T COLLEGES OFFERING COURSES AT CONVENIENT TIMES OF DAY CONVENIENT TIMES OF THE WEEK WHY AREN'T THEY MORE FLEXIBLE IN FORMAT? AND THOSE KINDS OF QUESTIONS WHY INDUSTRY ISN'T PARTNERING WITH COLLEGES IN SUCH A WAY THAT WORKING ADULTS HAVE ON THE JOB TRAINING EXPERIENCES ON EDUCATION AND TRAINING A MORE IS MORE SEAMLESSLY INTEGRATED. SO THIS IS JUST AN ENCOURAGEMENT TO THINK ABOUT RELIGION ISSUES TO SIFT THROUGH ALL THE POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES BEFORE YOU LAND ON WHAT YOU THINK WOULD BE THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE RESPONSE. SO I HAVE AN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. QUESTIONS. MISTER O'DONNELL. YES THANK YOU I HAVE A QUESTION WITH REGARD TO CS YOU MAY BE GIVING YOU COULD INCLUDE YOU SEE FACILITIES. DID YOU EXAMINE HOW HOW HOW THE FACILITIES. HOW THE PROCURED AT AT AT A SPECIFIC CSU IN OTHER WORDS ARE ARE ALL THESE? ARE ALL THE UNIVERSITY OF THE. CAMPUSES IF YOU WILL. OPERATING SEPARATELY. DO THEY GO THROUGH IS THERE SOME CENTRALIZED PROTOCOL. WHERE THERE'S OVERSIGHT? AND AND NOW I HAVE A SECOND QUESTION THERE IN YOU MAY KNOW THE ANSWER THIS YOU MAY NOT MAYBE LOOK TO THIS. ARE THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS ON CAMPUS SHARING SPACE. SO HEY YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE THE. MEN OF THIS DEPARTMENT AT THAT YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE BUILDING NOBODY ELSE CAN COME AND BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU NEED TO SPACE YOUR OTHER DEPARTMENT. SHE WILL YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO BUILD SOME NEW SOME NEW US A NEW SPACE TO CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT I DID YOU INVESTIGATE ANY THAT. HAVE REGARDING THE FIRST POINT WE HAS AN OFFICE HAVE HAD A LONG STANDING CONCERN THAT. THE CENTRAL OFFICES WHETHER IT BE SERIOUS YOU OR YOU SEE THEY TEND TO TAKE THE A PROJECTS THAT OUR SUBMITTED FROM THE SEGMENTS AND. BEING OVERLY SIMPLISTIC MAKING SURE CAMPUSES GET STUFF EVERY SO OFTEN WITHOUT DECIDING STRATEGICALLY WHICH CAMPUS TO GET THE NEXT PROGRAM BECAUSE BASED ON A SYSTEM WIDE PLAN. THAT'S WHERE ENROLLMENT GROWTH IS AND THAT'S WHERE EXISTING FACILITIES ARE BEING USED AT CAPACITY. IT DOESN'T FUNDS THE BEADS ON ONE THOUGHT SORT OF STRATEGIC VISION OF WHAT THE SYSTEM NEEDS WHERE IT NEEDS IT WHEN IT NEEDS IT IT TENDS TO BE OF SPECIFIC CAMPUS HOW THE BUILDING THAT'S AGING AND WOULD LIKE TO MODERNIZE AT SO IT'S VERY CAMPUS SPECIFIC. IT DOESN'T HAVE A SYSTEM WIDE MUCH LESS A STATEWIDE FOCUSED. NOT BEING SENT THAT PART OF THE JOB YOU MIGHT SAY WELL THAT'S OUR JOB OR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES JOB BUT UNDER THE NEW CAPABLY SYSTEM THESE PROJECT PROPOSALS HAVEN'T BEEN REALLY. GIVEN A REALLY THOROUGH I'LL LOOK INTO. THE STATE IN THE PAST HAS HAD STANDARDS FOR DIFFERENT KINDS OF SPACE FOR CLASSROOMS FOR TEACHING LAB SCIENCE LABS. BUT IT HASN'T BEEN A SPECIFIC AS REQUIRING. DEPARTMENT LEVEL DATA SO AS A STATE WE'VE NEVER HAD THAT NOW IT TO THE EXTENT THAT IT HAPPENS I SUSPECT IT MIGHT HAPPEN IF THERE'S TO SCIENCE BUILDINGS PRETTY CLOSE BY THEN MAYBE THE LABS ARE WILLING TO. IN CERTAIN TIMES THE EFFORT OF THE STATE LEGISLATIVE GUIDELINES WHEN THEY WERE REALLY USED ON IN FOREST WAS THAT. THE STATE WOULD BE STUDYING THESE AGGREGATE WE WANT TEACHING LABS TO BE IS A CERTAIN NUMBER OF DAYS A WEEK A CERTAIN NUMBER OF HOURS WITH DUST FILLED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME YOU GO FORTH UNIVERSE INTO TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN WILL GIVE YOU FLEXIBILITY TO MANAGE IT AT. THE CAMPUS LEVEL. BUT MANY OF THE SORT OF WATCHDOG FUNCTION HAS DETERIORATED OVER THE YEARS. AND HOW WOULD THAT. WHAT WE THERE HELLO WATCHDOG FUNCTION MIGHT OCCUR THERE WOULD BE AT THE CHANCELLOR'S LEVEL OBVIOUSLY? AND WHAT SOME. OFFICER OFFICER WITHIN. THAT BUILDING. WOULD. YEAH I THINK AND OTHER. HISTORIC. PROCESS HAS BEEN THAT THE STATE HAS STATUTORY LEGIT LEGISLATIVE GUIDELINES FOR THE USE OF SPACE. FOUR WHAT'S ENTAILED TO HAVE APPROVAL FOR NEW SPACE. AND THAT THE SEGMENTS WOULD RECOGNIZE IF THEY WERE GOING TO SUBMIT A PROPOSAL THEY WOULD HAVE TO ADHERE TO THOSE GUIDELINES. FINANCE WOULD REJECT LOTS OF PROPOSALS THAT JUST SENATE MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS AND THEN WE MIGHT SUGGEST YEARS JACKSON PROPOSALS THAT DONE THAT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS AND YOU WOULD GO AHEAD AND REJECT THEM ASK THEM TO BE RESUBMITTED ONCE THEY HAD BETTER DOCUMENTATION OR ASK THE SEGMENTS OF RESUBMIT A. NEW LIST PROJECTS TO THAT DID MEET YOUR PRIORITIES. ON THE LAST FEW YEARS WITH A SORT OF APPROVAL OF PROJECTS HAS BECOME MUCH MORE PRO FORMA. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER MARTUCCI THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO. ASSN QUESTIONS RICK RELATE TO FIGURE SEVEN. SO ACCORDING TO FIGURE SEVEN WHICH SHOWS THE. PER P. PER STUDENT FUNDING. FOR THE THREE SEGMENTS. I IT IT IT SEEMS THAT. THAT WHILE THE CSU AND THE COMMITTEE COLLEGE FUNDING. EL IS. PRETTY MUCH AT OR NEAR THE PEAK. A OVER THE LAST SIX. MINUTES OF THIRTY YEARS. THE UNIVERSE A CALIFORNIA PER STUDENT FUNDING DRAMATICALLY DROPPED AFTER NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT PER OR THEREABOUTS. AND. IS AND HAS A LONG WAY TO GO TO. GET BACK TO WHERE IT WAS ONCE IN THE LATE NINETIES IS IS THAT I ACCURATE TO. INTERPRETATION OF YOU OF FIGURE SEVEN I THINK IT IS YEAH OKAY SO. COULD YOU TALK ABOUT. YOU KNOW. Y.. THE A STATE PER STUDENT FUNDING HAS DRAMATICALLY DROP. IN PARTICULAR FOR THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY RELATIVE TO THE CAL STATE IN THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES. AND WHAT ARE THE. BIGGEST BARRIERS TOWARD RESTORING THAT LOST UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA A PER STUDENT FUNDING. I THINK THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU SEE AND ACTUALLY BECAUSE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE STRAIGHT FORWARD AND THAT THE COLLEGES ARE WITHIN NINETY EIGHT AND THEIR FUNDING IS BEING DRIVEN BY IT SORT OF FORMULAS THAT HAVE BEEN GENERALLY GROWING OVER TIME. IN EXCESS OF INFLATION. AYE IS MORE DIFFICULT TO PINPOINT THE DIFFERENCES IN UC AND CSU DID YOU SEE STARTED A PARTICULARLY HIGH LEVEL AND THEN WHEN THE STATE HIT THE RECESSION THAT PURPOSELY WANT TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS THE STATE. HAS MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO TRY TO BUILD UP CSU FUNDING A LITTLE BIT MORE. IT'S JUST A PRIORITIZATION THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS HAD A FOR A FEW YEARS. HOW FOR EXAMPLE OUT AWHILE AGO VCS USE BASED INCREASED WAS LINKED TO UC'S BASING CHRIS EVEN THOUGH AT THE TIME YOU SEE HOW TO HIRE A BASE SO THAT WAS ONE EFFORTS TO JUST? PRIORITIZE THE ISSUE A LITTLE BIT MORE. AND AND IT HAS BEEN GROWING. MORE NOTABLY BUT. IT IN RECENT YEARS BUT AGAIN AT. IT LARGELY COMES I THINK TO JUST PRIORITIES OF THE STATE AND HOW IT'S DECIDED TO. ITEM. AND MAKE THESE DECISIONS AT BOTH UC AND CSU FEES WENT UP VERY STEEPLY DURING THE RECESSION. AT AND THE STATE BUDGET. GENERAL FUND WENT DOWN FOR BOTH SEGMENTS I THINK PART OF THIS IS JUST COMING OUT OF THAT WITH THE STATE'S PRIORITIES HAVE BEEN AND EVEN DURING THE RECESSION WHAT DISPARITIES. BUTTON BUT AGAIN I MEAN LOOK AT THIS GRAPH IT DOES SEEM TO BE STRENGTH EATEN LEAD DIFFERENT FROM. THE CSU INCOMING COLLEGE IS A. THERE IS THERE ANYTHING TO ACCOUNT. LIKE OFTEN WE WE HEAR THAT THE. THEY DID THE REASON WHY THE UNIVERSE TO CALIFORNIA OF FUNDING HAS DROPPED IS BECAUSE OF THE RECESSION. BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THE THE DROPS. YOU KNOW NO PRECEDED AND EVEN CONTINUE DURING THE DOT COM BOOM BEFORE THE GREAT RISK RECESSION OF A. DIDN'T START AROUND OH SEVEN OO EIGHT. ANY ANY. REASON FOR THAT. YOU KNOW THIS IS JUST SPECULATION. BUT I MEAN I WAS HERE DURING THE LATE NINETIES AND THERE WAS A LOT OF EFFECTIVELY DISCRETIONARY RESOURCES SINCE THE STATE'S FISCAL SITUATION WAS GOOD. AND IS LOOKS LIKE FROM THE GRAPH THAT THE STATE AND I THINK WE CAN SOME OF US REMEMBER THE A. STATE KINDS OF THINGS THE STATE DEAD IN THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES THAT BENEFITTED YOU SEE IT APPEARS THAT IT DID THAT SORT OF DISPROPORTIONATELY TO CS YOU. SEE YOU SEE THEN WAS AND TRAIN. THE DOT COM BUST AT A HIGHER LEVEL AND SO THAT'S WHEN YOU GET TO THE DOT COM BUST YOU SEE THAT SORT OF TEMPORARY LATE NINETIES ADDITIONAL SPENDING SORT OF CUT AS THE FIRST THING TO GO. NOW IS THAT A SIGN THAT SOME OF THAT FUNDING IT WAS REALLY SORT OF ADDITIONAL BENEFIT BECAUSE THE STATE TIMES WERE SO GOOD I'M SURE YOU SEE IT WOULD HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION AND BELIEVE THAT THOSE ARE REALLY CRUCIAL. AN EXTRA AUGMENTATIONS DURING THAT TIME BUT THAT PROBABLY EXPLAINS A TOUCH OF THAT AGAIN THIS IS JUST ALL ABOUT THE STATE'S PRIORITIES OVER TIME. ALRIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR MEDINA BUT BUT ON THIS POINT I WILL NOTE THAT THIS ISN'T JUST GENERAL FUND HERE THIS IS COR FUNDS ARE STUDENT FEES SO. WHEN THEY INCREASE STUDENT FEES ARE NON STUDENT. PARA STATE. REVENUE THIS IS ALL PART OF THAT SAME RIGHT AGENT BECAUSE GENERAL FINANCIAL OCEAN FROM THE UNIVERSITY'S VANTAGE POINT IS FUNGIBLE THEY USE BOTH FUNDS SOURCES TO RUN THEIR CORE OPERATIONS WE LOOK. NOT ONLY FOR YOU SEE AT STATE GENERAL FUND AND RESIDENTS WHO WISH ON THAT BECAUSE THEY USE SOME NON RESIDENT TUITION SO CROSS SUBSIDIZE THEIR CORE PROGRAM. WE INCLUDE EVEN THAT. OKAY. MR MEDINA GETS REQUEST QUESTIONS TO. THE GOVERNOR'S PERMIT FINEST. COULD YOU EXPLAIN TO ME HOW. COULD EXPLAIN TO ME HOW. THE GOVERNOR KNOWS THAT THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA. WILL WORK. AS IT PERTAINS TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES. SURE SO I. AM JUST STEPPING BACK A LITTLE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE EXISTING AT FUNDING FORMULA AND THE IT AND IT CONCERNS I'M. WITH DEAFENING FORMULATING HIS BEEN CONVERSATIONS. THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE CAMINO WORK FOR THE HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THE EXISTING FUNDING FORMULA. SO THERE ARE SEVERAL CONCERNS. THAT IT'S BASED ON ENROLLMENT AND IT MAKES A VERY CHALLENGING. FOR. COLLEGES I SPECIALLY GIVEN THE ECONOMIC CHANGES WHEN ENROLLMENT WHEN ECONOMIC TIMES ARE GOOD. COLLEGES AT SUPPER WHEN THEY AT CANNOT PAT ATTAIN THE A ROMANTIC AND THEY'RE CHEATING GROWTH AND AND AND OPPOSITE HAPPENS WHEN. AT TIMES ARE ARE BAD SO I THINK THERE IS A RECOGNITION THAT THE FUNNY THE EXISTING FUNDING FORMULA. ISN'T WORKING. I THINK WE LOOKED AT SEVERAL MODELS WE KNOW THAT OVER THIRTY STATES HAVE IMPLEMENTED SOME TYPE OF A OUTCOMES BASED PERFORMANCE SPACE IN THEIR FUNDING FORMULA AS A WAY TO AND CENTS. UP HERE RURAL INSTITUTIONAL AYE CHANGES AND THAT'S THE ELLIOTT POINTED OUT I HAD THE RESEARCH HAS INDICATED THAT THIS HAS RESULT HEAD AND. ABBY HE REALLY CHANGES IN THOSE STATES THAT HAVE ADOPTED SOME SORT OF OUTCOMES IN THEIR FUNDING FORMULA. IN THE FUNDING FORMULA ALSO PROPOSES TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL A FUNDING FOR DISTRICTS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS THAT THE DISTRICTS% SERVE. AS WE KNOW IT THAT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN THAT AREA. AB COULD BE AT HELPFUL IS SO I YOU KNOW I THINK THIS IS A FRAMEWORK THAT TRAITS IS TRYING TO ADDRESS. VARIOUS CONCERNS AND THAT BUILDS ON THE RESEARCH OF WHAT OTHER STATES. HAVE DONE. I WOULD NOT THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE CONVENED AT SEVERAL WORKGROUPS THAT. CHIEF BEEN PRETTY OPEN THAT WE ARE. OPEN TO CONSIDERING WHETHER THESE ARE AT THE RIGHT FACTORS THAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING A LOT OF OF FEEDBACK INCLUDING IS THERE A BETTER WAY TO PLANNED. AT. THE SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT WITH OUTCOMES AND WE ARE IT CERTAINLY TAKING THAT INTO CONSIDERATION BUT WE REALLY THINK THAT BASED ON THE RESEARCH. AND BASED ON THE CONCERNS OF THIS IS A WAY TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE CONCERNS. AND I HAVE A SIMILAR QUESTION TO THE GOVERNOR'S IDEA OF PROPOSAL. TO FIND A ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. ONE TIME FOR ONLINE. IF YOU COULD. SHOW ME WHAT EVIDENCE WE HAVE THAT THIS WOULD ALSO WORK AND WHAT EVIDENCE. DOES THE GOVERNOR HAVE IN PROPOSING THIS. SHIRTS ALL ALL SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. MAY RESPOND TO SOME SORT OF THE LA ELBOWS AND QUESTION ABOUT WHAT WHAT ARE AT THE ROOT CAUSES WHAT WE WHAT'S THE PROBLEM HERE. SO WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION WORKING ADULTS AT BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWENTY FIVE AND THIRTY FOUR WHO DON'T HAVE A POST SECONDARY. CREDENTIAL WE LOOKED AT THE AVERAGE WAGES OF OF THIS POPULATION AND WE WE KNOW THAT AT THE AFTER AVERAGE ANNUAL WAGES TWENTY THREE AT THE HOUSE AND. WE KNOW THAT. EIGHTY PERCENT OF THIS POPULATION IS CURRENTLY WORKING. OUT AND WE KNOW THAT. FORTY PERCENT ARE ARE THAT THE NOT. SO I. THE THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT THERE A OUR INCOME. UP DISPARITIES AND THAT IS THE THIS IS A POPULATION THAT IS AN AXIS SEEN. THE EXISTING COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND DEMOCRAT COURSES. WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE ARE WORKING THERE IS A NEED FOR FLEXIBLE OPTIONS I AM GIVEN THEIR FAMILIAL Y. WORK OBLIGATIONS. SO WITH SO WHY AREN'T OF THE STUDENTS OR THE WORKING ADULTS ACCESS SEEN EXISTING ONLINE COURSE AT THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES. WE KNOW THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF ONLINE AT THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES HAS BEEN BUILT AROUND THE MORE TRADITIONAL STUDENTS. OF FIRST TIME FRESHMEN. WHO IS SEEKING A GREATER TRANSFER TO A UNIVERSITY AND WHERE WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE CHALLENGES? WITH REGARDS TO I FACULTY LOAD ACADEMIC CALENDARS. AND THAT DON'T ALLOW FOR FLEXIBLE ON DEMAND BURST OF EDUCATION AND. SO THIS IS A WAY TO PROVIDE A TUONO ADD TO PROVIDE A FOCUSED EFFORT TO. REACHED UP POPULATION AND PROVIDE MORE ECONOMIC AND EDUCATIONAL. OPPORTUNITIES. AND LIKE. I WOULD JUST ADD THIS IS ALSO A GROUP OF CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED WHEN RECESSIONS OCCUR I THINK. WE CERTAINLY SEE THAT THERE'S A BENEFIT TO HELPING THESE STUDENTS AND THESE ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA FURTHER THEIR. INCOME PROSPERITY THEIR ECONOMIC MOBILITY. AND WE KNOW THAT THAT WILL HELP SAFEGUARD AGAINST DOWNTURNS IN THE ECONOMY FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS. SO I I I HEAR YOU SAYING THERE'S TWO POINT FIVE MILLION. WORKING ADULTS. EIGHTY PERCENT OF THOSE BEING LATINA. WHO ARE NOT BEING ABLE TO ACCESS? HIGHER EDUCATION ARE. ABOUT FORTY EIGHT PERCENT OF OF THAT TWO POINT FIVE ARE LATINO ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE TWO POINT FIVE ARE WORKING WORKING EIGHTY PERCENT WORKING FORTY PERCENT LATINA. BUT I DID NOT HEAR IN YOUR RESPONSE. ANY EVIDENCE THAT THIS IS THE BEST WAY. OR THIS IS THE WAY THAT WILL WORKWITH THESE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION AND WHICH IS THE QUESTION THAT. I ASKED. DO YOU HAVE ANY EVIDENCE BECAUSE AS AN EDUCATOR. I'M SKEPTICAL. AS AN EDUCATOR. THIRTY SOME YEARS. AS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRUSTEE HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THIS IS THE BEST WAY. OF MAKING SURE THAT THAT TWO POINT FIVE MILLION STUDENTS. FORTY PERCENT LATINO WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. IN MY OWN MIND I THINK. YOU KNOW ARE THESE THE STUDENTS WHO ARE GONNA HAVE THE MOST ABILITY. TO DO ONLINE LEARNING. I I KNOW I CAN THINK OF RIGHT AWAY THE SAN JOSE STATE. A STUDY THAT SHOWED THAT STUDENTS HAD A HARD TIME. BEING SUCCESSFUL WITH ONLINE LEARNING HOW DO I KNOW. THAT THIS IS BETTER THAN THE PROGRAMS ALREADY EXISTING AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES BECAUSE MANY COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ALREADY HAVE. ONLINE LEARNING. WHO AND WHAT EVIDENCE DOES THE GOVERNOR HAVE THAT THIS IS BETTER AND THAT THIS WILL WORK? AUTHORED OFTEN AND SO SO WE KNOW THAT THESE AT TWO POINT FIVE MILLION. ADULTS CURLY DON'T ACCESS. I. COURSES SO. THAT WE THINK THAT THAT'S EVIDENCE THAT THE TRADITIONAL. STRUCTURE ISN'T. WORKING FOR THAT WE ALSO KNOW THAT AND THE DEMAND FOR ONLINE IS GROWING WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND. EYES AT STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA OTHER ACCESS SEEN ONLINE PROGRAMS A PRIVATE EYE INSTITUTIONS SO WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A DEMAND WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A SHIFT. TOWARDS ONLINE TOWARDS FLEXIBLE I'M OPTIONS. FOR ADULTS WHO CAN'T ATTEND YOUR TRADITIONAL. CLASS AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT. IDEAS OPPORTUNITIES FOR. AT THIS POPULATION TO ADVANCE IN THEIR EMPLOYMENT AND TO PROMOTE WHAT'S. ADDS THROUGH. ISSUE CERTIFICATES THAT ARE RECOGNIZED BY THE THE EMPLOYERS WE REALLY THINK THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY HERE. TO HELP. THIS POPULATION ADVANCE IN TERMS OF SUCCESS AN ONLINE WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN I'M IMPROVEMENTS AND. COURSE COMPLETIONS AN ONLINE. THE COMEDIC COLLEGE. AT A DATA SHOWS THAT THAT GAP BETWEEN FACE TO FACE AN ONLINE IS CLOSING IN WHO WE ALSO KNOW THAT. THERE ARE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF INNOVATIONS IN AN ONLINE AND WITH PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS. BECOMING EASIER. TO TO IDENTIFY THE SKILLS GAPS AND ADDRESS THOSE EARLY ON AND THEN I'M ONLINE SETTING SO SO WE THINK THAT THIS IS A SOLUTION TO REACH A POPULATION THAT. CURRENTLY JUST AS AN ACCENT THINGAND. AT PROVIDING A FLEXIBLE OPTION. IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT I THINK WE KNOW THAT THERE'S RESEARCH OUT THERE. THAT INDICATES THAT ADULT LEARNERS. PERFORM BEST IN A SELF DIRECTED ENVIRONMENT I THINK THAT'S ALL A LONG STANDING RESEARCH PATTERNED. WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY. HAS ROUGHLY ELEVEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS IN THERE UP FACE TO FACE CLASSROOM WE KNOW THAT THEIR ROUGHLY TEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS TAKING ONLINE PROGRAMS THROUGH ASU ONLINE. AND IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THOSE STUDENTS ARE ROUGHLY. COMPLETING THE PROGRAMS AND HAVING SUCCESS RATES THAT ARE ALMOST IDENTICAL BETWEEN THE TWO FORMATS. I I WOULD SAY. THAT I DO NOT SEE NOR DO I HEAR A WHOLE LOT OF EVIDENCE TO CONVINCE ME THAT THIS IS. REALLY A PROGRAM THAT WILL WORK AND IN THE WAY THAT IT'S INTENDED TO WORK. OUR I I HAVEN'T SEEN HER OR HEARD THAT EVIDENCE AND I HAVEN'T HEARD IT HERE TODAY EITHER. TO ME IT'S A A BIG PROGRAM SHIFT. IN THE WEIGH. AND IT AND IT HAS ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS OF GOVERNANCE AND CONFLICT OF INTEREST THE PROPOSAL FROM THE GOVERNOR. IS TO SET THIS UP IN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. HI AS A INDEPENDENT COLLEGE WHO WOULD GOVERN THAT IS UNCLEAR TO ME TO THEIR ISSUES OF GOVERNANCE. AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST THAT ARISES. APART FROM THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM. THE A INVESTORS SURE OF A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS A CERTAINLY A BIG SOUND. I I SEE IT IS A SHIFT. IN POLICY AND I WOULD I WOULD SAY AND I'M ASKING OUR LEADERSHIP. TO BRING THIS PROPOSAL WHERE CAN BE BETTER DISCUSS AND THAT WOULD BE IN THAT COMMITTEE OF HIGHER EDUCATION. I'M ASKING OUR LEADERSHIP TO DO THAT TO BRING THIS MEASURE TO HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE. AYE I THINK IT'S. WORTH. FLUSHING OUT. AND ASKING THE QUESTIONS THAT I THINK THAT LA SO OFFICE RAZORS. AND QUESTIONS THAT I KNOW A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SO I I WILL. CONTINUE TO ASK. LEADERSHIP TO DO THAT TO BRING THIS FORWARD TO. WHERE WE CAN DISCUSS IT MORE IN THE STOCK COMMITTEE ON HIGHER EDUCATION? THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA IS ALSO A SHIFT. BUT IF A YOU KNOW YOU FEEL STRONGLY THAT THAT THAT'S GOING TO WORK ALRIGHT WE'LL GIVE IT A TRY. BUT CERTAINLY I THINK THE ONLINE COLLEGE DESERVES A FAIR HEARING. OF MERCANTE TALKED ABOUT IN MORE DETAIL. WELL THANK YOU MISTER AYE MEDINA AND AS I MENTIONED BEFORE YOU GOT HERE. THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW. HOT TOPICS IN THE BUDGET ACTUALLY ONE OF THE FEW TOPICS IN THE BUDGET AND ALL SORTS OF MINIMAL BUDGET FOR HIGHER ED. I THIS IS THE OVERVIEW WE'RE GOING TO DIG INTO IT DEEP IN THE POLICY I. THINK IN THE POLICY IN THE BUDGET IMPLICATIONS IN THE HEARING IN A FEW. IN A FEW WEEKS BUT THERE IS PRECEDENT I WILL REMIND US THAT TOUGH YEARS AGO WHEN THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED. AT LCF HALF. I BELIEVE THAT WAS YOUR YOUR ALL YOUR FIRST YEAR HERE. IT WAS A TWO YEAR PROCESS DURING THE FIRST YEAR I THINK THE SUBCOMMITTEE ARE REJECTED THE PROPOSAL DIRECTOR THE GOVERNOR TO INTRODUCE A BILL IN POLICY COMMITTEE THE GOVERNOR DID NOT DO THAT. IT IS ACTUALLY I TOOK A TIME OUT FOR THE YEAR AND CAME BACK THE NEXT YEAR IN THE BUDGET AGAIN SO. I WEEK WE HAVE ENTERTAINED THESE ISSUES ON BIG IT ON BIG POLICY MATTERS SO SOMETHING WE WILL. YOU KNOW. THAT PUT INTO CONSIDERATION AS WE MOVE FORWARD SO. I THINK YOU FOR THAT I OR WE ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE SEGMENTS IN A FEW SECONDS AS WELL BY THE I I WANTED TO JUST ASK ON THE OVERALL. A FUNDING FOR THE UC AND CSU AND GRANTED IT WAS A LIGHT BUDGET THIS I'M THIS IS JANUARY TEN. A TON OF MONEY WENT TO. THE RESERVE RAINY DAY FUND WHICH IS GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA GOOD FOR US TO TO SET UP FOR. YOU KNOW. BUDGET PROBLEMS DOWN THE ROAD. THEM THE MAJORITY MONEY WENT TO PROP NINETY EIGHT WHICH WE ARE HEARING IN COMMITTEE COLLEGES AND K. TWELVE SO WAS A LOT GENERAL FUND MONEY AND THE FIRST PLACE BUT. I'M HAD THERE BEEN MAYBE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE INVESTMENTS IN. UCC ISSUE HIGHER ED HEALTH OTHER ISSUES AS WELL BY IS WHEN I GO TO THE OVERALL PREMISE OF THE OF THE THREE PERCENT BECAUSE. IT KIND OF. BECAUSE WHAT ONE OF THE ISSUES AS WE DON'T WANT TO INCREASE STUDENT FEES NONE OF US WANT THAT TO STUDENTS DON'T WANT THAT THEM. FAMILIES AND OUR COMMUNITIES DON'T WANT THAT. BUT THE SAME TIME THERE IS THIS. BELIEF THAT THAT THAT THAT GOVERN THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT ARE SAYING HEY. THE PROMISES THREE PERCENT AND WE'RE GOING HERE IN A FEW MOMENTS THE SEGMENTS ARE SAYING WELL. WITH THREE PERCENT WAS OUT OF MONEY TO. PAY THE BILLS THE BASICS PAY FOR. GOT COMPENSATION YOU KNOW THE. RIGHTFULLY EARNED COMPENSATION INCREASES. NO MONEY TO PAY FOR STUDENTS. ENROLLMENT GROWTH WHICH IS WHAT WE NEED TO YOU KNOW MAKE SURE WE AND MARK GRADUATES IN CALIFORNIA. SO HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THAT ISSUE. YOU SAYING NO ONE STUDENT FEE INCREASES NO ADDITIONAL. I MONEY ABOUT THREE PERCENT. SO I THINK YOU KNOW THERE THERE ARE A COUPLE THINGS THAT I TIGHTLY I THINK FIRST AT THREE PERCENT. THAT IS ACTUALLY LARGER THAN THE IMPLICIT PRICE THE PREDATOR THAT WE SEE TODAY WHICH IS TWO POINT FIVE ONE PERCENT. SO I I WOULD ARGUE THAT IT'S A HEALTHY INVESTMENT WITHIN THE. THE CSU ON THE UC. I THINK THE SECOND COMPONENT THAT WE'VE YOU KNOW VOCALIZED. HAS BEEN. ENCOURAGING BOTH SEGMENTS TO LOOK AT THEIR COST STRUCTURES. AND LOOK AT WAYS TO REDUCE THEIR COSTS INTERNALLY SO THAT WITH THIS THREE PERCENT AUGMENTATION AS WELL AS THEIR THE RESOURCES. THEY ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR ALL OF THEIR COSTS WITHOUT REQUIRING ADDITIONAL TUITION INCREASES. SO I AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF THAT COULD BE AS STUDENTS ARE GRADUATING IN A MORE TIMELY MANNER FROM THE CSU THROUGH THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THAT IN THEORY IS OPENING UP CAPACITY TO EITHER SERVE ADDITIONAL STUDENTS OR CHIU UTILIZE THOSE RESOURCES TO MEET. THE GOALS OF THE CSU. YEAH I I MEAN WERE IN FULL ACCORD WITH THAT ESPECIALLY THE GRADUATES INITIATIVES WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING. LATER ON ABOUT. I FURTHER INCENTIVIZING STUDENTS WHO GET A CAL GRANT TO GO FULL TIME TRUTHFUL TIME THAT THE BELL DEFINITION OF FULL TIME. I WANT TO ASK YOU LA ELF YOU COULD CARP RESPOND TO THAT AND. YOU KNOW THAT DESIRES THAT DID NOT INCREASE FEES BUT THEN. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE A PLUGGING IN THREE PERCENT BY THREE PERCENT IS GREATER THAN A TRADITIONAL CALL IS TODAY ROUGHLY TWO AND A HALF. PERCENT WHICH AS YOU KNOW AS YOU NOTED THERE ARE. FIXED COSTS IN EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION HEALTH COSTS. RETIREMENT COSTS WHAT BUT HAPPY SO HOW DO WE RECONCILE THESE THINGS. YEAH AND BECAUSE THAT THEIR EFFECTIVELY HAVING THE STATE GENERAL FUND BEAR THAT. AUGMENTATION FOR THE ENTIRE COURT BUDGET ADEQUATE STE MORE LIKE ONE AND A HALF SO DEPENDING ON YOUR INFLATION INDICATOR IS. ON THE CORNER FUND BUDGET PERSPECTIVE ISN'T EQUATING TO INFLATION HAVING SAID THAT WE'VE NEVER ENCOURAGED YOU TO JUST GIVE THEM AN INFLATION ADJUSTMENT AND WALK AWAY. WE'VE ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT WHAT INCREASES IF ANY DO YOU WANT TO SUPPORT AT THE SEGMENTS IS IT. FACULTY'S SALARIES ARE NOT COMPETITIVE AND YOU WANT TO MAKE THEM MORE COMPETITIVE ANYONE INCREASE THEM THREE OR FOUR OR FIVE PERCENT TO PERCENT WHATEVER YOU FIND REASONABLE. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HAVE AS ENROLLMENT GROWTH WHAT KIND OF INCREASES IN DOT SERVICE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE BECAUSE OF NEW CAPITAL OUTLAY REQUEST? AND SO THIS IS JUST A MATTER OF IS ESTABLISHING YOUR PRIORITIES ARE WE TRYING TO DO ON THE REPORT IS WALK THROUGH THINGS LIKE COMPENSATION ENROLLMENT GROWTH THESE ADDITIONAL EFFORTS TO IMPROVE ACADEMIC QUALITY OF EACH OF THE STATEMENTS TO JUST TRY TO GIVE YOU A FRAMEWORK FOR WHETHER THOSE. WOULD BE THE KINDS OF THINGS YOU WOULD WANT TO SUPPORT. WHEN IT COMES TO FEE INCREASES WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTANDS THIS. I'D. IDEA IS SUMMIT IS GOING TO BE BEARING THE COST INCREASES GOING TO BE THE GENERAL TAXPAYER IS GOING TO BE THE STUDENT WHETHER IT'S THREE PERCENT OR ONE AND A HALF PERCENT. THERE'S A COST TO BEAR SO WE'D JUST CONTINUALLY ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO THINK ABOUT LET'S MAKE SURE THEY'RE ESSENTIAL THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO DO WHETHER THE STATE'S GOING TO BEAR THE FULL COST OR WHETHER THEY WOULD BE SHARED. AND THIS IS. ECONOMIC EXPANSION AND WAGES STILL ARE GOING ON BY AND LARGE WHETHER THIS IS A TIME WHERE YOU THINK IT WOULD BE REASONABLE TO ASK FAMILIES TO PAY. SOME MODEST AMOUNT MORE IS AGAIN WITHIN YOUR BAILIWICK TO DECIDE. THAT WOULD JUST BE. CONTEXT FOR THE THINGS YOU MIGHT CONSIDER I'M SORRY THIS IS A FINAL COMMENT AND I DIDN'T A VERY SYSTEMATICALLY MENTIONED THIS BUT OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS THE NEXT FEW MONTHS IS DECIDING YOUR PRIORITIES WHAT KIND OF BUDGET YOU WANT TO SUPPORT. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF AREAS WHERE WE ARE GOING TO RECOMMEND REJECTING WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PRESENTED TO YOU INNOVATION AWARDS THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION LEARNING LAB A NEW THING THAT HE CREATES. PRIOR YEAR APPRENTICESHIP REIMBURSEMENTS. MAYBE REVISITING THE SIZE OR IF YOU WANNA DO THIS ONLINE COLLEGE AT ALL. WE. DON'T TELL YOU EXACTLY HOW YOU WOULD REPURPOSE THOSE WE JUST IDENTIFY IF YOU DON'T REJECT THEM YOU'D HAVE MONEY TO DO YOUR OWN PRIORITIES. WE DO OFFER SOME SUGGESTIONS AND THEN I'LL ASSESS WHAT YOU COULD DO MORE FOR FINANCIAL AID IF YOU FOR EXAMPLE WANTED TO PROVIDE ALL FULL TIME FINANCIALLY NEEDY COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS THAT HAVE ARE NOT LIVING COSTS WITH THE GRANT. THAT WOULD COST MORE THAN THE GOVERNOR'S PRESENTED TO YOU. I'M IF YOU WANTED TO PROVIDE APPRENTICESHIPS MORE FUNDING ON ONGOING BASIS THAT WOULD COST MORE SO THIS IS ALL WHAT YOU'RE DOING RIGHT NOW IS FIGURING OUT WHAT KIND OF BUDGET YOU ONE OBVIOUSLY AS THE WEEKS GONE ARE HAPPY TO TRY TO HELP YOU DID. ASSEMBLYMEMBER LIMA. THANK YOU AND SO I YOU KNOW AS THEY CAME IN AND IT WAS HEARING SOME OF THE DISCUSSION. AND SO I WANTED TO COME AND JUST OVERALL AND I NEED TO THE ASPECTS THAT WE WERE DISCUSSING AND THE ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE I THINK I WOULD ECHO. I YOU KNOW MY COLLEAGUES AT COMMENTS IN TERMS OF LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE. HAVING SERVED ON TO KEEP YOUR SCHOOL BOARD AND I ALSO KNOW THAT ROLLOUT AND IMPLEMENTATION IS A WHOLE OTHER THING NO MATTER WHAT THE TREND IS DOING. AND PARTICULARLY FOR EXACTLY THE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE THAT WERE TRYING TO I'M REACH AND A TIMER OVER THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS WE'VE STILL TALKED ABOUT SOME COMMUNITIES NOT EVEN HAVING. FULL NEEDED ACCESS TO INTERNET. ITS YOU KNOW I I THINK OF HOW MANY PEOPLE OF THE TWO POINT FIVE ARE IN THOSE EXACT SAME COMMUNITIES WHERE WE HAVE THE ISSUES. AND THAT THEY STILL DON'T HAVE FULL ACCESS ESPECIALLY IN RURAL CALIFORNIA AND SO I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF ELEMENTS AND THAT I TO HIM LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT INVESTMENT AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME. I THINK WE NEED CREATIVITY NAY THINK THERE'S REASONS TO BE CREATIVE AND TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO REACH A HARD TO REACH POPULATION. AND BUT I ALSO THINK THAT AND THERE ARE SOME TOOLS IN PLACE AND SEVEN MET INVESTMENTS IF I LOOKED AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND I LOOK AT THE FUNDING HAS BEEN MULTIPLE INVESTMENTS MADE TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROGRAMS AND NOT ALL ONLINE. THAT REACH THAT YOU KNOW ARE TARGETED TO REACH SOME OF OUR HARD TO REACH STUDENTS AND AND SO I THINK OF YOU KNOW. HOW DO WE WAY THAT OUT BUT I AM I DO I DO I THINK THAT? THAT EVIDENCE IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT FOR AT LEAST ME AND TO BETTER UNDERSTAND IF THIS IS THE RIGHT INVESTMENT AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT IN TIME. ON IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER YOU KNOW IN OTHER FORMS OF LOOKING AT WHAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE. ANNIE DOING FURTHER EXPANSION INVESTING THERE OR REALLY STARTING A WHOLE NEW GRANDMA AND BRAND. ON THE FRONT. RELATED TO THE UC FUNDING. YOU KNOW I I WANT TO BE SURE THAT THE STUDENT VOICES IS AND NARRATIVE IS NOT LOST IN THIS AND SO I THINK ABOUT THE FACT WHAT YOU KNOW. EVEN THERE IS MENTION ABOUT YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S. THREE PERCENT IS MORE THAN TWO POINT FIVE. BUT IT'S NOT THE FOUR PERCENT. AND AND I ALSO THINK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAS. BECOME VERY REAL IN THE LIFE OF STUDENTS AYE AND DADDY IS THAT THAT THE LANDSCAPE AND HIGHER IT IS CHANGING. AND AT A TIME WHERE WE ARE ALSO THINKING ABOUT WHAT IMPACTS. AND CHANGES WE MAY SEE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH A STUDENT SUPPORT PROGRAMS TITLE NINE. THE PELL GRANT FIFTEEN UNITS VERSUS TWELVE UNITS. I THINK OF THE FACT THAT OUR STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT. JUST THINKING ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS ONE YEAR OF TUITION. AND INCREASE AND MORE ABOUT HOW MUCH IMPACT CAN BE TAKE IN THE COMING YEAR AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW. JUST HOW WE INCORPORATE THAT IT WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S THINKING IN TERMS OF LIKE THERE MAY ACTUALLY BE OTHER CUTS AND IF WE'RE INCREASING TUITION. AND A TIME WHERE WE MAY BE TELLING STUDENTS THAT. YOU KNOW TWELVE HAS BEEN CONSIDERED FOR TWELVE UNITS HAS BEEN CONSIDER FULL TIME FOR PURPOSES OF FINANCIAL AID BUT WE MAKE UP THAT ON YOU TO FIFTEEN IT'S GONNA MEAN THAT THEY ARE GOING TO PAY MORE. IN TUITION HAVE TO WORK MORE HOURS I MEAN NOT BE ABLE TO WORK AS MANY HOURS BECAUSE THEY NOW HAVE TO TAKE. THE THREE UNIT DIFFERENCE IN QUARTER. YOU KNOW I IN SCHOOLS THAT RUN ON A QUARTER SYSTEM AS A WHOLE OTHER CLASS. HOW HOW DOES THAT INCORPORATE INTO ALL OF THIS AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE? AND THAT WE AT LEAST CONSIDER A STOP GAP IN A YEAR WHERE THEY MAY BE OTHER FEDERAL IMPACTS. SO YOU THINK IT'S DIFFICULT FRONT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IT'S DIFFICULT AT BEST TO PROTECT. WHAT THIS FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION WILL MOVE FORWARD WITH AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT AND I THINK? YOU KNOW IT WE UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN CERTAINLY. BUT IT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL OR WON'T DO AT THIS POINT. I'M SURE WOULD BE PREMATURE FOR THE STATE TO TAKE ACTION BASED ON. WHAT IT DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL BE MOVING FORWARD WITH IT IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT? POSITION BUT WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE. THAT WE NEED TO MONITOR IT. WE MEAN TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ULTIMATELY MOVES FORWARD WITH AND TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION. AS THE YOU KNOW THE DID IT THAT SPECIFIC INFORMATION BECOMES VERY CLEAR TO THE STATE. UP BUT UNTIL THAT POINT IN TIME I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WOULD BE PREMATURE TO ASSUME WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL OR WILL. WELL AND I APPRECIATE THAT. BUT I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT THESE ARE VERY SPECIFIC ON ITEMS THAT HAVE BEEN SHARED WITH THE PUBLIC IN TERMS OF THE DIRECTION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAY BE GOING. AND I ALSO WANT TO AND. YOU KNOW KNOWING OUR PROCESS HAVE SOMETHING IN PLACE THAT WE HAVE THE MEANS TO CORRECT THAT IF NEED BE AND SO I WANT TO BE SURE THAT TO AS. THIS BUT YOU KNOW BUDGET. MOVES FORWARD AYE THAT IF THERE IS THE HOW A TRIGGER WHAT IS THAT TRIGGER GONNA LOOK LIKE TO RE CORRECT ANYTHING THAT MAY HAPPEN BECAUSE IN THE LIFE. OF A STUDENT. TO WAIT AN ENTIRE ACADEMIC YEAR. YOU KNOW THE THE VERY GOAL OF HELPING STUDENTS REACH TIME TO DEGREE MAY BE IMPACTED AND BY SAYING HEY THIS WAS OF THE BUDGET WE REALLY CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS UNTIL ANOTHER YEAR WHEN SOME OF THESE CHANGES. AND CAN BE REALLY. YOU KNOW DETRIMENTAL TO THE THE LIFE OF A STUDENT AND NOT JUST IN TERMS OF GETTING INTO IT. A YOU SEE BUT GRADUATING FROM A YOU SEE AND ALSO BEING SUCCESSFUL ON THIS IT YES SO SO. I HOPE THAT THERE'S SOME THOUGHT INTO WHAT WOULD TRIGGER. A A REMEDY. FOR STUDENTS IF SOME OF THIS WERE TO HAPPEN AND IN LIGHT OF THE CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN TWO POINT FIVE TO THREE PERCENT TO FIVE PERCENT TO FOUR PERCENT. OKAY WITH THAT WE WANT TO UPGRADE OF THIS TO MEDINA YET THERE IS A SUPREME COURT JUDGE AND I FORGET. HIS NAME BUT IT WAS A SUPREME COURT JUDGE OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT AND HE WAS SPEAKING ABOUT THE DEATH PENALTY. AND HE SAID. BUT TALKING ABOUT THE DEATH PENALTY DID HE WOULD NO LONGER. I CONTEMPLATE DEALING AROUND THE EDGES OF THE DEATH PENALTY HE THREW IT OUT THE CITY'S NO LUCK HE'S TIRED OF DEALING WITH IT. AND THAT THERE WAS NO PLACE FOR. I FEEL LIKE THAT JUDGE THAT YEAR AFTER YEAR WE SIT HERE. IN SACRAMENTO TO TALK ABOUT HIGHER EDUCATION. AND YEAR AFTER YEAR WE HEAR FROM. GOVERNOR. WHY WE CAN'T DO BETTER FOR HIGHER EDUCATION? I HAVE. DONE LISTENING TO WHY WE CAN'T DO BETTER. I AM DONE LISTENING IT IS UNFAIR TO THE STUDENTS WHO SIT HERE OVER GOING TO HEAR FROM. LATER IN PUBLIC TESTIMONY IT IS UNFAIR TO THE THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT HERE IN SACRAMENTO BUT ARE IN THE CAMPUSES AND THEY DON'T GET TO COME UP HERE TO SACRAMENTO. YOU KNOW THEY'RE BUSY TAKING CLASSES THEY'RE BUILT THEIR BUSY WITH TWO JOBS AND WE DON'T HEAR FROM THEM. BUT I HOPE WE HEAR FROM OF THIS YEAR. SO I'M DONE LISTENING TO WHY WE CAN'T DO BETTER. BUT. LET ME ASK A QUESTION. DID WE OR DID WE NOT HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH WITH UC THAT WE WOULD THAT THE GOVERNOR WOULD NOT RAISE. THAT WE WOULDN'T SEE TUITION RAISES AND THAT WE WOULD GIVE UC FOUR PERCENT. IN THE TIME OF HIS TERM OF GOVERNOR SO THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO YOU SEE WE WOULD NOT HAVE TO SEE. A TUITION RAISES WASN'T THERE. WAS THAT AGREEMENT IN PLACE OR NOT. BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR AND YOU SEE. HELLO JACK'S WALT FROM A FINANCE. I THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN. THE GOVERNOR AND THE UC PRESIDENT. PREDICATED THAT IN THE LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR THAT THE UNIVERSITY COULD. INCREASED TUITION. YOU MIGHT WITH INFLATION. HOWEVER. I LAST YEAR'S TUITION INCREASE OF BOTH THE UC. AND THE CSU WAS GREATER THAN PREDICTED INFLATION. SO THE WHILE THERE WEREN'T WHAT'S AGREEMENT. WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH. THE UC AND CSU. TWO ONE WAY FORWARD AND TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE COMPONENTS OF THAT AGREEMENT. ADDRESSING THE COST STRUCTURE. MAINTAINING. AND. TO WHICH INCREASES IN LINE WITH INFLATION AND OUT THE OTHER SPIRIT OF THAT AGREEMENT ARE. CONTINUE TO BE THE BASE FOR POLICY SO TRIP TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THE TUITION ROSE HIGHER THAN THE RATE OF INFLATION. THAT'S CORRECT. AND THAT THEREFORE THE AGREEMENT IS NO LONGER AN AGREEMENT. WELL I WOULDN'T SAY THAT UP. BUT. THE THE INFLATION THEIR GRADE RATHER TUITION DAVID. INCREASE FASTER THAN INFLATION AND. A CORRESPONDING MOVES MADE ARE ALL PART. WELL AYE I WILL ECHO WHAT A COLLEAGUE OF MINE SAID. THE IN SPEAKING ABOUT OUR GOVERNOR HE SAID THE GOVERNOR GIVES US SOMETHING. THEN HE TAKES IT AWAY. AND THEN WE WANT TO THANK HIM WHEN HE GIVES IT BACK TO US WHAT HE'D ALREADY PROMISED. IT OUT TO ME A PROMISE IS A PROMISE AND AND WE'VE MADE A PROMISE TO CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE A PLACE. AND HIGHER EDUCATION THE CHART. ON PAGE TWELVE FIGURE SEVEN SHOWS THAT WE'VE NOT MADE MAINTAIN THAT PROMISE YEAH. YEAH LET'S AND. CAN WE GET TO THE SEGMENTS MISTER O'DONNELL FORMER QUESTION. THE QUESTION YET MY MY QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH REGARD TO THE ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. YEAH I I WAS LED TO BELIEVE THAT IT ISN'T AMY. IT ISN'T SOMETHING IT'S ALWAYS SEE COULD AGREE ON. BUT IT WAS SEEK TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC. SKILL GAPS CAN YOU SPEAK I IN I DON'T THINK. IF THAT IS SUCH THAT THAT IS A PROPOSAL YOU IT HAS NOT BEEN MADE CLEAR I DON'T KNOW IF OTHERS ON THE COMMITTEE KNOWS BUT. I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THAT YET SAID THAT THE PROPOSAL IS THAT THIS COMMITTEE COLLEGE WILL FOCUS ON SHORT TERM. CERTIFICATES CREDENTIAL IS NOT THE TYPICAL I TRANSFER AT A DEGREE THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THESE WOULD BE STACKABLE ALSO OF A STUDENT DOES WANT TO PURSUE. A FOR. DECREED THAT THE COMMITTEE COLLEGE COVER FOR THAT AT THAT STUDENTS TO OTHER LOCAL COMMITTEE COLLEGE BUT THEY DHEA IS THAT THESE CREDENTIALS. AND THE CERTIFICATES WOULD BE CLOSELY LINKED TO A STUDENTS APPOINTMENTS SO FOR INSTANCE IT COULD BE ASHORE I MEAN A PROJECT MANAGEMENT QUARTERS THE LAST TWO TO THREE WEEKS. THAT IS RECOGNIZED BY THE EMPLOYER AND THAT WOULD ALLOW THAT EMPLOYEE FOR INSTANCE TO PROMOTE TOOL AS SUPERB VYTORIN POSITION SO THESE ARE THE TYPES OF. EYES CERTIFICATE SHORT TERM STE CERTIFICATES. IT'S NOT YOUR TRADITIONAL. DEGREE AND WE'RE WORKING WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND TO PROVIDE MORE DETAILS ON WHAT THOSE LOOK LIKE MOVING FORWARD THROUGH THE SPRING PROCESS. THE USER IS THERE ANY CONTEMPLATION WHO TEACH THESE CLASSES ARE THEY. CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY ARE THEY IMMUNITY CITY IN RUSSIA WHERE THESE PEOPLE. YEAH. THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THIS COLLEGE BUT RELY ON THE EXPERTISE THE FACULTY OF THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES JUST LIKE ANY COLLEGE DISTRICT AT THE COLLEGE WOULD BE ABLE TO HIRE AT FACULTY AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF EXPERTISE. IN THE EXISTING COLLEGES TO HER WITH A WITH A DROP IN THE EXISTING PULL CALIFORNIA. THREE COLLEGE FACULTY OR WERE THEY CREATE THEIR OWN UNIVERSITY THESE PEOPLE COULD BE FAR FAR AWAY. IN THEORY IF SO CAN YOU DO HAVE YOU CONTEMPLATED THAT IN YOUR WHOLE. I THINK GENERALLY IT'S IT'S CONTEMPLATED IN THAT YES THE COLLEGE COULD HIRE NEW FACULTY I THINK THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THOSE FACULTY. WOULD BE A QUALIFIED AS ANY OTHER FACULTY ARE WITHIN THE SYSTEM. TWO IS I MEAN I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER MY QUESTION THAT'S WHY I'M THEM AND I'M POKING AROUND SO THAT WOULD THOSE FACULTY BE LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA MIGHT THEY BE FAR FAR AWAY. WOULD THEY BE FROM EXISTING FACULTY IN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S A QUESTION THAT THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ANSWER AT SOME POINT IN THIS VENTURE CERTAINLY DO YOU DO YOU KNOW THE ANSWER TODAY. SO I WOULD SAY. IT IS LIKELY THAT YOU COULD HAVE THIS COLLEGE HIRING SOME EXISTING FACULTY MEMBERS. OR A COULD BE A HIRING SOME ADJUNCT FACULTY THAT ARE WORKING PART TIME AT SOME OF THESE COLLEGES IT COULD BE HIRING NEW FACULTY FOR THE SYSTEM WITHIN. A YOU KNOW QUALIFIED FACULTY THAT ARE IN CALIFORNIA. I THINK THERE ARE MANY OPTIONS FOR HIRING FACULTY BUT MY STATEMENT REALLY IS THAT IF THEY WOULD HAVE TO MEET. THE MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS TO BE A FACULTY MEMBER AYE IN A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AND YOU CAN ASK THIS QUESTION WOULD THEY HAVE TO BE LOCATED PHYSICALLY IN CALIFORNIA. I THINK GENERALLY I DON'T THINK THAT THE TRAILER BILL SPEAKS TO THAT SPECIFIC ASPECT BUT GENERALLY YOU WOULD EXPECT THE COLLEGE TO BE HIRING FROM WITHIN THE STATE. LET'S GET ON TO OUR NEXT TO. OUR NEXT THAT PANEL WILL HAVE THE THREE SEGMENTS COME UP AND PROVIDE INSIGHT ON THE. GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS. AS THEY COME UP WE'RE GONNA CALL ROLE WILL QUIT. MR MCCARTY HERE. CHAVEZ MISLI MON. MR MEDINA HERE. MISTER MURATSUCHI. MISTER O'DONNELL HERE MISTER VOEPEL GO. OKAY. WE'LL START WITH THE. UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA AND CSU THEIR COMMUNICABLE GE'S. HAVE A NEW FACE FOR THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SO PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF. THANK YOU HONORABLE TERM MCCARTY AND HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SAY EVER TATTENHAM HERE ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THE SURGEON WILL BE HANDING OUT A HANDOUT UMP THAT. TYPE PROVIDE WILL HAVE PROVIDED TO YOU. WITH SOME BACKUP DATA. TO GIVE YOU AN OVERALL PICTURE THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS THE OVERALL BUDGET OF THIRTY FOUR AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS. OF THIS APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD ARE FROM OUR MEDICAL CENTERS UP AND ANOTHER THIRTY FIVE PERCENT ARE SELF SUPPORTING AUXILIARIES UP AND FACULTY RESEARCH HARDCORE FUNDS BUDGET. IS APPROXIMATELY EIGHT POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AND THIS IS COMPOSED OF STATE GENERAL FUND SUPPORT. STUDENT TUITION NON RESIDENT SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION AND VARIOUS OTHER STUDENT FEES AND A FEW SMALLER. FUNDING SOURCES SUCH AS PATENT REVENUE. MAKE UP THE THE DIFFERENCE THAT I THINK THE IMPORTANT TAKEAWAYS HERE ARE. THAT STATE GENERAL FUNDS ARE APPROXIMATELY FORTY PERCENT OF OUR CORE INSTRUCTIONAL BUDGET. ON SLIDE TREE THREE. YOU WILL SEE HOW THE COR FUND BUDGET FOR UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS CHANGED SINCE TWO THOUSAND. AND ONE OF THE IMPORTANT TAKEAWAYS HERE IS DOT OUR STATE GENERAL FUND SUPPORT HAS FLUCTUATED. WITH THE. THE STATE'S ECONOMY. WE HAVE RECEIVED INCREASES AND WE HAVE BEEN DECREASE AND WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL. TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR FOR THE INCREASES THAT WE HAVE BEEN RECEIVING SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION. BUT WE DID ALSO SUSTAIN APPROXIMATELY A BILLION DOLLARS OF CUTS DURING THAT TIME. AND AT THIS TIME OUR STATE GENERAL FUND SUPPORT IS ABOUT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS MORE THAN IT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND. THE DIFFERENCE FROM OUR FUNDING SOURCES HAS BEEN MADE UP FROM PRIMARILY STUDENT FEES AND APPROXIMATELY A BILLION DOLLARS IN NON RESIDENT REVENUE. NON RESIDENT STUDENT TUITION REVENUE. ARE. AVAILABLE COR FUNDS PER STUDENT WHEN ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION HAVE DROPPED BY. APPROXIMATELY OF FOUR THOUSAND. EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS PER STUDENT SINCE TWO THOUSAND. DURING THIS TIME. WELL LET'S SEE. AND THEN IF YOU MOVE ON THE SLIDE FOR. YOU WILL SEE THAT OUR UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT HAS GROWN. BY OVER SIXTY THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FD STUDENTS SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE UNFORTUNATELY I DIDN'T HAVE THE UNDERGRADUATE FTE  <u><c.green>BROKEN DOWN BY</c></u> RESIDENCY STATUS FROM PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND FIVE BECAUSE WE MEASURED IT DIFFERENTLY. FOR CONSISTENCY I WANTED TO PROVIDE A SINGLE. SINGLE CHART. AND. IN OUR RESIDENT OF STUDENT POPULATION THE UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITY POPULATION HAS BEEN. GROWING STEADILY AS YOU WILL SEE ON THE CHART ON THE RIGHT THERE. THE TOTAL UNDERGRADUATE FTE HAS ACTUALLY GROWN BY EIGHTY EIGHT THOUSAND SINCE A TWO THOUSAND. THIS IS WHAT IMPACTS THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE PER STUDENT. AND LIKE I SAID ARE UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY STUDENTS HAVE INCREASED BY HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR PERCENT SINCE TWO THOUSAND. AND YOU ARE I'M STUDENTS ARE NOW ABOUT THIRTY FOUR PERCENT OF THE ENTIRE CALIFORNIA RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATE POPULATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. TO SUPPORT ALL OF OUR STUDENTS THE UNIVERSITY NEEDS ADDITIONAL FUNDS. WE NEED TO WE NEED FUNDS FOR INSTRUCTORS STUDENTS SERVICES PERSONNEL. OF OUR OFFICES SUCH AS FINANCIAL AID AND MENTAL HEALTH. AND BASIC BEHIND THE SEAS SCENES FUNCTIONALITY LIKE CUSTODIAL SERVICES AND LIBRARY STAFF. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THE. ADDITIONAL FUNDS THE THREE PERCENT GROWTH PROVIDED BY THE GOVERNOR BECAUSE THEY ARE ON THE FORTY PERCENT OF OUR STATE. ODD GENERAL FUND COMPONENT. ACTUALLY REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY A ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT GROWTH FOR THE ENTIRE CORPS FUNDS BUDGET FOR INSTRUCTION SODAS. AS A WHOLE BELOW INFLATION. FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TWO UNIVERSITY IS GOING TO BE GROWING AGAIN WHEREIN THE PROCESS OF ADMITTING NEW STUDENTS AS WE SPEAK. THE CURRENT PLAN IS FOR THE UNIVERSITY TO GROW BY TWO THOUSAND RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATES FOR NEXT YEAR. AND ALSO FIVE HUNDRED GRADUATE STUDENTS. TOOK THESE BUT INDIVIDUALS WILL NEED INSTRUCTION AND. STAFF TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. ON SLIDE FIVE. UP YOU WILL AGAIN SEE OUR CORE FUNDS PER STUDENT. AND THIS IS TO ILLUSTRATE HOW HOUR TOTAL CORE FUNDS VERSUS AVAILABLE COR FUNDS PER STUDENT ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE ARE CERTAIN FUNCTIONS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PAYS FOR. OUT OF OUR TOTAL CORE FUND BUDGET THESE INCLUDE A RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR FACULTY AND STAFF. GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND DEBT PAYMENTS AND FINANCIAL AID THOSE COMPONENTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO HIRE NEW FACULTY AND NEW STAFF. AND THE GENERAL OBLIGATION IN LEASE. BOND PAYMENTS HAVE BEEN INCREASING OVER THE LAST. LAST SEVERAL YEARS. ON SLIDE SIX ARMED YOU WILL SEE HOW THE UNIVERSITY HAS STEADILY INCREASED. OF OUR STUDENT FACULTY RATIO. OVER THE LAST. BOB SEVERAL DECADES. UGH THIS MEANS THAT STUDENTS WHO ARE ENROLLING TODAY ARE RECEIVING A LESS INDIVIDUALIZED ATTENTION FROM FACULTY. AND ALSO SITTING IN CLASSROOMS THAT ARE MORE CROWDED. THAN PREVIOUS GENERATIONS. WHILE WE WOULD LIKE TO REDUCE OUR STUDENT FACULTY RATIO REDUCING THAT RATIO BY ONLY ONE STUDENT PER FACULTY WITH TAKE APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS. SO THEY ADDITIONAL FUNDS BEING PROVIDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ARE NOT GOING TO MOVE THE NEEDLE. ON THE STUDENT FACULTY RATIO AT THIS TIME. AND ON SLIDE SEVEN. THIS IS THE UNIVERSITY'S BUDGET ASK IN ADDITION TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE ARE REQUESTING AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS OFF THIS IT IS IN LIEU OF THE TUITION AND STUDENT FEE INCREASE SO THIS WOULD KEEP TUITION AND STUDENT SERVICES BE. THE SAME AS IN CURRENT YEAR FOR NEXT YEAR SO THAT STUDENTS. DO NOT EXPERIENCE AN ADDITIONAL BURDEN ON THEIR. TUITION BILLS STOW WE DO TAKE GOOD CARE OF OUR STUDENTS IN TERMS OF FINANCIAL AID. APPROXIMATELY HALF OF OUR STUDENTS DO NOT PAY TUITION FEES BECAUSE OF OUR FINANCIAL AID PACKAGES CURRENTLY. AND ALSO PROVIDING THE SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO THE SYSTEM WOULD SAVE THE STATE SOME MONEY ON THE CAL GRANTS BECAUSE. A. SO MANY OF OUR STUDENTS ON. RECEIVE FINANCIAL AID. CALTRANS COVER A PORTION OF THAT OF THOSE FEES FOR STUDENTS SO IT'S APPROXIMATELY TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS OF SAVINGS ON THAT. WE'RE REQUESTING TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO ADDRESS IMPACTS OF RECENT GROWTH ON THE SYSTEM. WE'VE RECEIVED FUNDING FOR SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED NEW CALIFORNIA RESIDENT STUDENTS IN THE LAST SEVERAL BUDGETS. BUT BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE WAS STRUCTURED AS AN ALL OR NOTHING. UP FINE FUNDING FOR THOSE STUDENTS ARE IN. FOR THE UC SYSTEM WE OVER AND ROLLED BY APPROXIMATELY TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED STUDENTS. THIS CREATES A BURDEN ON THE CAMPUSES BECAUSE CLASSROOMS ARE OVERCROWDED AND THE FUNDING TO HIRE NEW INSTRUCTORS IS NOT THERE SO WE ARE REQUESTING AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. TO PROVIDE EDUCATION AND STUDENT SERVICES. EDUCATION STUDENTS ARE RECESS FOR THE POPULATION OF STUDENTS. THAT IS ALREADY ON OUR CAMPUSES. A IN ADDITION WE'RE REQUESTING TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE NEW ENROLLMENT GROWTH THAT WE WILL BE TAKING ON FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT. AS PART OF THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN YOU SEE WAS DIRECTED TO RE DIRECT FROM THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT BUDGET TO THE CAMPUSES FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH. AND ALSO WE'RE REQUESTING ONE TIME THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR TO CRITICAL DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS ON OUR CAMPUSES. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY NEXT CSU. A GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS RYAN STORM OF THE ASSISTANT VICE CHANCELLOR FOR BUDGET FOR THE SEIZE YOU SYSTEM. LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU THIS BUDGET CYCLE AGAIN. THE FIRST THING I WANTED TO DO WAS START OFF WITH. REAL A HIGH LEVEL AYE CHARACTERIZATION OF SOMETHING IN THAT IN THAT THE C. ISSUE AND STATE LEADERS SHARE RELEASED SAME FUNDING PRIORITIES. THEY ARE IMPROVING OUR GRADUATION RATES. THEY'RE CREASING STUDENT ACCESS AND THEY ARE FAIRLY COMPENSATING OUR EMPLOYEES. SORRY VISIT THESE PRIORITIES THROUGHOUT MY COMMENTS. SO THESE PER PARTIES HAVE BEEN A CURRENTLY ARE IN CONTINUE TO BE OUR SHARE PARTY'S. SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK A LOOK FIRST AT HOW THESE PARTIES HAVE BEEN PORTED IN THE RECENT PAST OF SKIN BECOME A PAST PRESENT FUTURE SORT OF PRESENTATION SO IF YOU SEE THIS HAND OUT HERE. THAT WE CAN WALK THROUGH REAL QUICKLY. I SO FUTURE TO PITCH TO LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU. AND MANY THIS ISSUE SUCCESSES SINCE THEIR ECONOMIC RECOVERY BEGAN. THESE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE REGULAR INVESTMENT BY THIS BODY AS WELL AS THE SENATE AND THE GOVERNOR WE THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR THOSE INVESTMENTS OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS OR SO. SO JUST READ QUICKLY AT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ENROLL A OVER THIRTY ONE THOUSAND MORE FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS ARE THAT'S EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND HEAD COUNT. A IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THAT FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE THAT'S EQUIVALENT TO ADDING. TWO CAMPUSES THE SIZE ONE THE SIZE OF C. ISSUE SEMBRA DE NO THE OTHERS THE SIZE A SEE ISSUE CHICO SO DURING THE RECOVERY WE'VE BEEN REALLY GOING GANGBUSTERS IN TERMS OF OUR ENROLLMENT I THINK. CAMPUSES HAVE ALSO ADDED A MANY NEW COURSE SECTIONS I TO THEIR COURSE OFFERINGS I JUST ALONE BETWEENLAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR WE'RE REPORTING TO YOU ABOUT THIRTY TWO HUNDRED ADDITIONAL COURSE SECTIONS WHICH IS GREAT FOR THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE. ARE YOU ALSO HAVE MORE STUDENTS PORTS LIKE ACADEMIC ADVISING AND A WHOLE HOST OF MENTORING SORTS OF PROGRAMS THAT REALLY HELP A NUMBER STUDENTS THAT PERSIST IN THEIR EDUCATION. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE A DENT IN OUR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IMPROVE INFRASTRUCTURE. UP BUT THEY'RE STILL A A MOUNTAIN OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE STILL OUT THERE HONOR CONNOR TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES. AND WE'VE CONSISTENTLY OVER THIS PERIOD. BEEN ABLE TO SETTLE MANY OF OUR EMPLOYEE CONTRACTS AND I THINK EVERYBODY IS HAPPY FOR FROM THAT VANTAGE POINT. SPECIALLY THAT THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE HAVE WITH OUR EMPLOYEES AND BEEN ABLE TO YOU KNOW FULFILL THE MISSION OF THE UNIVERSITY AND NOT NOT BE WRAPPED UP IN IN IN. IN CHALLENGES OF OF SALARIES IN THOSE SORTS OF THINGS SO I THINK IT'S BEEN REALLY GET THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SETTLE OUT THOSE CONTRACTS. WE'VE KEPT PACE ALSO WITH INCREASING HEALTH CARE A PENSION COSTS ANOTHER MANDATORY COST INCREASES OVER THIS TIME. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST. AND WILL FOCUS WILL BE ON THIS ON THE NEXT FEW SLIDES OUT WE BUT WE WERE ABLE TO START THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE. WHICH IS REALLY AN EMPHASIS ON ON THOSE TWO TO WATCH PERSISTING GET DONE AND FOR TO YEARS THIS TRANSFER STUDENTS THAN. THERE WERE TRYING TO DO OUR BEST TO ADD TO DELIVER THAT TO THEM. SO WE TURN TO PAGE THREE. TALKING A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE GOING FOR TODAY AND ABOUT WHAT OUR BUDGET ASK WILL BE. SO PAGE THREE CONTAINS MORE DETAIL BETTER GRADUATION INITIATIVE. IT HAS AN AMBITIOUS IT'S AN AMBITIOUS PLAN THAT SETS ACHIEVABLE TARGETS. TO INCREASE GRADUATION RATES FOR ALL STERN GROUPS AND ELIMINATE ACHIEVEMENT IN OPPORTUNITY. GAPS. AS YOU CAN SEE WE ARE SHARING OUR STARTING POINT HERE. THE THE FIRST LINE BEING ARE THE FIRST DOT COLUMN BEING TWENTY FIFTEEN. AND OUR LONGER TERM GOAL ON THE FAR RIGHT SIDE. THAT'S. IN THE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE COLUMN AND THEN OUR PROGRESS TO DATE JUSTIN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. WE FEEL THAT WE'VE DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB GETAN THIS THING GOING WITH. ESPECIALLY WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING WOULD BEEN ABLE TO INVEST LIKE I DESCRIBED ALREADY. SOURCE MADE POSSIBLE HIGHER MORE ADVISERS. MORE FACULTY. CREATE NEW ECONOMIC SUPPORTS FOR NEW CONTINUING STUDENTS. AND UP ALL OF THIS WILL INCREASE COMPLETION ULTIMATELY. A PAGE FOR. OF YOUR HANDOUT SERVES A COUPLE OF PURPOSES. YOU SEEN A VERSION OF THIS OVER THE YEARS AND AND HOPEFULLY THIS DOESN'T SURPRISE HOW WE HOW WE LAY ASIDE EVERY YEAR BUT I THINK IT'S ILLUSTRATIVE OF OF A NUMBER OF THINGS. A ONE OF THE PURPOSES TO BACK TO IS TO TO IS TO DEPICT. OUR ASSURE PARTIES TODAY AS REFLECTED IN THE CS USE REQUEST FOR AN ADDITIONAL FOR A BRITISH OF FUNDING FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. SO THE RIGHT COLUMN HERE OF INFORMATION IS THE TRUSTEES REQUESTS INCREASE OF TWO HUNDRED SIXTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO FIND. ONLY THE MOST ESSENTIAL ITEMS. IN THE C. ISSUE. WHICH OTHER GRADUATION INITIATIVE FAIR COMPENSATION INCREASES ENROLLMENT GROWTH. VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF ENROLLMENT GROWTH ENROLLMENT GROWTH NONE THE LESS. FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS THAT WE CONTINUE TO NEED TO BE ON TOP OF. AND ALSO MANDATORY COST INCREASES LIKE HEALTH CARE AND PENTECOSTAL SORT OF THINGS. SO WEEK GREAT MOMENTUM IN ON TRACK TO MAKE HISTORIC UP PROGRESS ON DOUBLING OUR FOR YOUR GRADUATION RATES THROUGH THE GRAD INITIATIVE. BUT WE WILL NEED ONGOING CONSISTENT HAND STE FUNDING TO REALIZE THOSE GOALS LAST YEAR'S. INVESTMENT OF SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IS NOT THE START AND FINISH WE NEED TO INVEST SEVENTY FIVE MILLION TWO OR MORE EVERY YEAR FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN RAKE MAKE GOOD PROGRESS IN GRADUATION ASH. ALSO AS THOUSANDS MORE STUDENTS MEET MINIMUM SEISHI RICK ELLIS VERTICAL ELIGIBLE REQUIREMENTS LIKE WE JUST HEARD EARLIER. AND AS A AS MORE STUDENTS COMPLETE THEIR ASSISTANT DEGREE FOR TRANSFERS AT THE SEAT AT THAT ME COLLEGES WE NEED RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN OFFER THEM A SEAT AT THE C. ISSUE. AND AFTER YEARS OF STAGNANT WAGES. DUE TO THE STATE'S FISCAL CONDITION AND THAT WAS FOR ABOUT A FIVE YEAR PERIOD. OUR FACULTY AND STAFF FOR RECEIVING WELL WRITTEN WELL. I DESERVED RACES. AND ON AVERAGE THAT'S ABOUT THREE PERCENT PER YEAR THAT'S COMPARABLE TO THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN RECEIVED BY STATE EMPLOYEES. THE OTHER PURPOSE OF THIS PAGE IS TO BEGIN ANSWERING THIS COMMITTEE'S QUESTION WHICH IS NAMELY WATER SEES SHE'S THOUGHTS ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL. NOW THAT GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL A PROVIDES ABOUT A ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT INCREASED WERE OPREME BUDGET WHICH FALLS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS SHORT OF I REQUEST THEY SEE ON THE RIGHT SIDE THERE. LIKE WE HAVE ALREADY DISCUSSED EARLIER. GET I THINK THE SAME IS TRUE WITH SIT WITH YOU SEE TO A LARGE EXTENT EACH UP OUR CORE OPERATING FUNDS ARE FUNDED ABOUT HALF BY TUITION AND HALF BY GENERAL FUND. SO WHEN IT'S WHEN IT'S SIDE DESCRIBED AS A THREE PERCENT INCREASE OR FOUR PERCENT INCREASE YOU IMMEDIATELY HAVE A OF A GENERAL FUND INCREASE YOU HAVE TO IMMEDIATELY FIGURE OUT WHAT DOES THAT. HOW DOES THAT APPLY TO THE ENTIRETY OF THE OPERATING BUDGET WILL IT WILL ULTIMATELY MEANS IT'S ABOUT HALF SO THAT'S WHY? YOU HEAR DIFFERENT NUMBERS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FROM THE VANTAGE POINT OF WHAT HOW DOES THAT GROW THE ENTIRETY OF THE UNIVERSITY'S BUDGET NOT JUST ONE PIECE OF THAT REVENUE SOURCE. I SO SO THERE'S ABOUT THERE'S A GAP OF ABOUT A HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS. I IF YOU SEE ON THE LEFT COLUMN HERE IT SHOWS HOW FAR WE COULD STRETCH THAT NINETY TWO MILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR. WHEN MEASURED AGAINST BUDGET THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED INCREASE PROVIDES LESS THAN HALF THE RATE OF INFLATION. AND IS SIXTY ONE MILLION SHORT OF WHAT WE NEED SIMPLY TO COVER OUR COMPENSATION INCREASES FOR FACULTY AND STAFF. AND ARE MANDATORY COST INCREASES LIKE IT'S HEALTH CARE AND PENSION COSTS. AND YOU CAN SEE HERE ON THIS SLIDE THE THE SIXTY ONE MILLION IS DEPICTED IN THAT IN THAT RED AREA OF THE OF THE DISPLAY. SO WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDS FROM THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR WILL BE A TOUGH BUDGET YEAR FOR THIS ISSUE ME THAT'S I THINK WE'VE. SHOWN HERE PRETTY CLEARLY SO CAMPUSES IF IF. IF YOU GET TO THE END OF THE PROCESS AND HAVE A SITUATION WHERE. THIS YEAR SHE RECEIVED ONLY NINETY TWO MILLION DOLLARS WE HAVE TWO CHOICES THAT WERE REALLY ARE REALLY TROUBLING I THINK IN A TIME WHEN WE HAVE A LOT OF NEW REVENUE COMING TO THE STATE. THERE'S A LOT OF NEED FOR NEW INVESTMENT UNIVERSITIES SO THE FIRST THING IS THE CAMPUSES WILL OUR CAMPUS PRESIDENTS PACIFIC WE WILL HAVE TO MAKE DIFFICULT. DECISIONS TO COVER FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. RESULTING IN POTENTIAL DECREASES AND CAMPUS OPERATIONS INCLUDING APP ACADEMIC PROGRAMS AND ECONOMIC SUPPORTS WE DON'T WANT TO BE ABLE TO WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO GO THERE. BUT THAT'S JUST THE STARK REALITY THAT WE FACE IF IF NOTHING CHANGES. IN IN THE IN THE BUDGET SITUATION. ANOTHER THING THAT. IS IS IS CHALLENGING FOR THE SEIZE YOU TO CONSIDER IS THAT THE TRUSTEES WILL HAVE TO CONSIDER WHETHER TO AUTHORIZE IT TUITION INCREASE TO MEET THOSE VERY BASIC FINANCIAL NEEDS OF OUR CAMPUSES. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY. THIS THAT. A POTENTIAL NEGATIVE BUDGET SCENARIO TODAY WOULD NOT PASS SET UP SEE ISSUE STUDENTS AND THE STATE'S ECONOMY FOR. WHAT WE WOULD HOPE TO BE A STELLAR? A CHAIR. A STELLAR OUR FUTURE FOR CALIFORNIA. WITH NEARLY A HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS EARNING BACHELOR'S DEGREES AT THE CSU EVERY YEAR. IN A TIME WHEN THE STATE IS A MULTIBILLION DOLLAR A SURPLUS. A WE BELIEVE THAT NO OTHER INVESTMENT HAS THE SAME POTENTIAL TO POSITIVELY IMPACT THE FUTURE OF THE STATE. SO PAGE FIVE. REALLY I THINK SUMS IT UP. OTHERS SEE SUMA STATE SHARED THESE COMMON PARTIES TODAY. AND THAT WILL SHAPE TOMORROW I MEAN CONSISTENT VESTMENT INCOMPLETION THROUGH THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE CONSISTENT INVESTMENT IN ACCESS THROUGH THE ROMAN INCREASES AND CONSISTENT INVESTMENT IN MOMENTUM. THROUGH REGULAR COMPENSATION INCREASES IN AND ALL THOSE OTHER NECESSITIES THAT I ALREADY DESCRIBED. THOSE THREE PARTIES WILL HELP CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE WORKFORCE NEEDS. SO WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE SOME GOOD PROGRESS AND WE HOPE TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE AND THE GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION TO CONTINUE THE MOMENTUM THAT WE'VE ALREADY ESTABLISHED HERE. AND WE TO SEIZE YOU CAN ONLY ACCOMPLISH THESE PARTIES WITH YOUR FINANCIAL PARTNERSHIP. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST FULL FUNDING OF THE C. ISSUES BUDGET REQUEST BY INVESTING AN ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. NOT FINANCE TODAY YOU'RE NOT FINANCE ANYMORE YOU THAT HE THOUGHT THAT YOU'RE SITTING IN YOUR OLD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TIME OVER THERE I'VE GOTTEN TOO USED TO IT HUMM WELL THANK YOU. CHEN MCCARTY MEMBERS I'M CHRISTIAN US MANY OF ICE CHANCELLOR FOR. FINANCE IN FACILITIES PLANNING FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. SO I WILL BE SPEAKING FROM THE LAST SET OF OF SLIDES THAT THE SERGEANT HANDED OUT. AND FINANCES PROVIDED YOU WITH DETAILS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS FOR THE COLLEGES. WERE SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S FRAMEWORK IN A BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROPOSALS BEFORE THAT I WANT TO PROVIDE SOME SHORT CONTEXT ABOUT THE COLLEGES IN OUR SYSTEMS PROCESS IN DEVELOPING OUR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET QUEST. SO BEGIN ON SLIDE TO. WHICH SHOWS COMMUNITY COLLEGE FUNDING OVER AN EIGHT YEAR PERIOD BEGINNING WITH ELEVEN TWELVE AS REFLECTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THE TOP LINE SHOWS TOTAL FUNDS INCLUDING STATE GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATIONS LOCAL PROPERTY TAXES AND STUDENT FEE REVENUES AND THE BOTTOM LINE SHOWS GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATIONS ONLY. AS YOU CAN SEE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE BENEFITTED FROM STUDY GROWTH FOLLOWING THE PASSAGE OF PROPOSITION THIRTY WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE GROWTH IN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT MINIMUM GUARANTEE OVER THAT PERIOD. FOR CONTEXT MAJORITY OF THAT STATE GENERAL FUND IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF TOTAL FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED FROM THE STATE TO THE COLLEGES BASED ON THE GENERAL APPORTIONMENT. A FORMULA THAT DISTRIBUTES FUNDS TO COLLEGES PRIMARILY BASED ON THEIR ENROLLMENT USING A PER STUDENT RATE AS FINANCE DISTRACT. OTHER FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED THROUGH CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS FOR SPECIFIED PURPOSES THESE INCLUDE FUNDS SPECIFICALLY FOR STUDENTS SERVICES AND WORKFORCE PROGRAMS. THE NEXT SLIDE SLIDE THREE SHOWS THAT NUMBER OF FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS ENROLLED IN THE COLLEGE'S. FULL TIME EQUIVALENTS STUDENTS ARE ONE MEASURE THAT WE USE A TO CONSIDER ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM. AND AS YOU CAN SEE WHILE THE SYSTEM IS EXPERIENCE GROWTH IN ENROLLMENT IN SOME YEARS THIS MEASURE OF WORKLOAD IS MORE VOLATILE THAN CHANGES IN FUNDING HAVE BEEN. AS I MENTIONED AFTER YES IS THE PRINCIPAL MEASURE USED IN THE ALLOCATION OF FUNDS THROUGH THE GENERAL PORTION IT SO WELL FUNDING HAS GROWN STEADILY STATE WIDE MANY DISTRICTS SPACE MORE VOLATILE FUNDING PICTURE. SLIDE FOUR COMBINES THESE TWO PREVIOUS PICTURES PER STUDENT FUNDING IS THE LOWEST OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES COMPARED TO THE OTHER SEGMENTS ARE SHOWN IN THE LA ILL REPORT. AND THESE DIFFERENCES HAVE LONG BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED IN STATE POLICY AND THEY'RE A MAJOR FEATURE OF THE MASTER PLAN. AS YOU CONSIDER OF THIS YEAR'S BUDGET THOUGH WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CHALLENGING LOGIC THE STATE IS USED AS EXPLICIT THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WHICH SERVE STUDENTS WHOSE CHARACTERISTICS SUGGESTS THAT THEY NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO SUCCEED IN POST SECONDARY EDUCATION. GENERAL GENERALLY RECEIVE THE LEAST AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT. ON PAGE FIVE WE SHOW THE VISION FOR SUCH A SUCCESS HISTORICALLY ACCESS HAS BEEN A PRINCIPAL GOAL FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THE MASTER PLAN SPECIFIED THAT ALL STUDENTS WHO COULD BENEFIT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE AND FROM THAT LENDS ENROLLMENT HAS BEEN THE PRINCIPAL MEASURE USED TO ASSESS WHETHER COLLEGES ARE MEETING THE STATE SCHOOLS. MORE RECENTLY THE GOVERNOR THE LEGISLATURE IN THE SYSTEM'S BOARD OF GOVERNORS HAVE ALL RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO MAKE OTHER GOALS. INCLUDING STUDENT SUCCESS ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED BY THE SYSTEM. KEY FOCUS. THIS SLIDE SHOWS THE GOALS INCLUDED IN THE VISION FOR SUCCESS WHICH WAS ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS LAST YEAR. THE VISION INCLUDE SIX SCHOOLS WHICH THE BOARD IN THE CHANCELLOR EXPECT BE ACHIEVED BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THESE GOALS HELPED TO BRING CALIFORNIA CLOSER TO ITS EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT NEEDS WHICH YOU DISCUSSED YOUR PREVIOUS HEARING. AS YOU'RE WEARING THEM MOVING ON THE SIDE SIX HISTORICALLY THE STATE THE SYSTEM IN INSTITUTIONS UNDERTOOK VARIOUS EFFORTS TO IMPROVE STUDENT SUCCESS USING MANY DIFFERENT STRATEGIES. LAST YEAR THE CHANCE OR PROPOSED IN THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED UNIFYING THOSE EFFORTS THROUGH A FRAMEWORK CALLED GUIDED PATHWAYS. AND THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET INCLUDED A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO BE SPENT OVER MULTI YEAR PERIOD. TO MOVE COLLEGES TOWARD THAT FRAMEWORK. IN SHORT GUIDED PATHWAYS IS A RESPONSE TO THE CAFETERIA STYLE APPROACH TO ORGANIZING A COLLEGE EXPERIENCE. AND WHICH STUDENTS ARE OFFERED MANY CHOICES WITH LIMITED DIRECTION. INSTEAD GUIDED PATHWAYS PROVIDES ALL STUDENTS WITH THE SET OF CLEAR COURSE TAKING PATTERNS AND INTEGRATE SERVICES ALONG THE WAY. ON SLIDE SEVEN YOU'LL SEE A BREAK DOWN OF FOR SPECIFIC WAYS IN WHICH WE IMAGINE THE COLLEGE COMMUNITY COLLEGE EXPERIENCE. FIRST THROUGH GUIDED PATHWAYS YOU WOULD CREATE CURRICULUM WITH THE LINK TO EMPLOYMENT IN FUTURE EDUCATION. SECOND YOU WOULD PROVIDE SUPPORT TO HELP STUDENTS CHOOSE AND ENTER PATHWAYS. THIRD YOU WOULD HELP STUDENTS STAY ON THE PATH AND FOURTH YOU DO IT WITH AN EYE TOWARDS. LEARNING CONSISTENT WITH INTENTIONAL OUTCOMES. SO IN THAT CONTEXT I COME TO OUR BOARD OF GOVERNORS REQUEST FOR THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET. THAT'S SHOWN ON SLIDES EIGHT AND NINE. THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS THE REQUESTS ARE LISTED ON EACH LINE. AND IN GENERAL WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS CONSISTENT WITH THIS REQUEST IT FOCUSES ON GROWTH IN THE GENERAL PORTION MEANT. PROPOSES A NEW ONLINE COLLEGE CONSISTENT WITH THE DISCUSSIONS ARE CALLED OUR SYSTEM HAD LAST YEAR ROUND ONLINE EDUCATION. THE PROPOSES REFORMS TO FINANCIAL ADDRESSES COORDINATION OF SERVICES PROVIDED THROUGH CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS AND RECOGNIZES THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE SYSTEM OFFICE. I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT ONE AREA WHERE WE HOPE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU IN THE ADMINISTRATION. THAT IS WITH REGARD TO SPECIFIC SUPPORT FOR FACULTY NOTABLY THE BOARD'S REQUESTS FOR SPECIFIC ALLOCATIONS FOR FULL TIME FACULTY HIRING AND PART TIME FACULTY OF SUPPORT. WE THINK THAT KIND OF SPENDING IS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THE VISION FOR SUCCESS. IN TOTAL THE REQUEST INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING WITH AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME. WITH THE RECOGNITION THAT THESE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES SHOULD BE SIZED WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE. THIS. BEES TO SLIDE SHOW OUR OPERATING BUDGET REQUEST IN ADDITION AS WE MENTIONED AT THE LAST HEARING THERE FIFTEEN CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS THAT OUR BOARD IS A. A SUBMITTED TO THE GOVERNOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF THOSE TEN WERE UNFUNDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND AND THOSE RAIN A PRIORITY FOR OUR BOARD. AND SO FINALLY THE OF THE LAST FEW SLIDES SLIDES TEN AND ELEVEN GO OVER. WHAT THE GOVERNOR WITH THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE PRESENTED EARLIER? VIEWS OF THE CHIU MADE SURE BUDGET PRIORITIES AND I WANT TO SIMPLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IS FINANCE DESCRIBED. NO THESE ARE ALSO PRIORITIES FOR THE CHANCELLOR. THE FIRST. IS THE ONLINE COLLEGE COVERED ON THIS FIRST SLIDE THE SECOND IS THE FUNDING FORMULA COVERED ON THAT SECOND SIDE. AND ARE YOU GOT THE HEART OFFICE SUPPORTS THE GOVERNOR'S FRAMEWORK BECAUSE THE PROPOSAL'S RESPOND TO PROBLEM STATEMENTS WITH WHICH WE CONCUR. THE CHALLENGES THAT FACE STRANDED WORKERS AND THE NEED TO IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES PARTICULARLY FOR HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED STUDENTS INCLUDING BY ALIGNING FINANCIAL INCENTIVES WITH OUR GOALS. WE BELIEVE THE FRAMEWORK CAN BE IMPROVED IN THE COMING MONTHS. AS FINANCE MET MENTIONED WE'VE ENGAGED IN STAKEHOLDER PROCESS IS ON BOTH AND WE ALSO WILL LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND ADMINISTRATION TO TO MAKE THOSE IMPROVEMENTS. WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ESTHER MEDINA. THIS AFTERNOON AFTER THE GERMAN OF THE ASSEMBLY I HAD THE HONOR OF HOSTING. FIFTEEN DIFFERENT. GRADUATE STUDENTS FROM THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FROM YOU SEE CSU AND THE PRIVATE COLLEGES. YOU SEE IS ASKING FOR A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR FUNDING FOR FIVE HUNDRED MORE GRADUATE STUDENTS SO FROM UC WHY IS THAT. IMPORTANT. OF GRADUATE STUDENTS ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO US FOR TWO PURPOSES OF THEY. SERVE AS RESEARCHERS TO ASSIST OUR FACULTY TO HELP PROVIDE. THE WORKFORCE TO. ALLOW THE FACULTY DO CONDUCT ALL THE RESEARCH AND GAIN ALL THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE SEEKING. AND ALSO AS GRADUATE STUDENTS STRUCTURES FOR UNDERGRADUATE SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE IN ANOTHER TWO THOUSAND UNDERGRADUATES WE NEED A WAY TO GIVE THEM INDIVIDUALIZED ATTENTION. THROUGH DISCUSSION SECTIONS WE NEED AN ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTORS OF THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS REPRESENTS THE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. PER STUDENT MARGINAL COST BUT IT. FOR FOR EACH GRADUATE STUDENT THAT'S HOW WE DERIVE DOT NUMBER. OKAY I I'VE A FEW QUESTIONS AND I GUESS I'LL START WITH THAT WAS THE ISSUE. AYE AYE AYE CERTAINLY. AND NEVER GOT RESPECT UNDERSTAND THIS SIMPLE MATHEMATICS OF THIS TABLE. UP BUT BUT I WILL SAY THAT. THAT THE TOP PRIORITY WHEN WE GO IN. AND OUR COMMUNITIES GO TO THE PARK A GROCERY STORE IS ACCESS. RIGHT GRAND WE MAY RUN INTO A FACULTY MEMBER IN THAT CONTACT THAT FUND. PAY FOR THE COMPENSATION BUT THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE CONCERNED THAT WE TURN AWAY THIRTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIA KIDS EVERY YEAR AT THE CSU SYSTEM SO. IT'S SOMEWHAT HARD TO SWALLOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PRIORITIES ACCESS. IS THAT THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST RATS TOP BUT IT'S. LAST THING OF IMPORTANCE FROM. FROM THE CS YOU I JUST WANNA KNOW THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST THING OF IMPORTANCE. THAT WE AS REPRESENTATIVES HERE FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS OUT SO I WANT TO POINT THAT OUT WELL IF YOU IF I COULD. ASSEMBLYMEMBER UP. THAT THAT LIST IS NOT NECESSARILY A RANK ORDER I AM WELL AWARE THAT I I JUST WANTED TO MAKE IT CLEAR IN THE PAST YEARS WE'VE WORKED WITH YOU IN THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT TRYING TO BALANCE ALL OF THOSE. VERY BASIC NEEDS OF THE UNIVERSITY AND I THINK WE'VE TRIED TO SPREAD THESE FUNDS. AS WELL AS WE COULD AND I THINK. BASICALLY VICE BY JUST BY WALKING THROUGH MY PRESENTATION EARLIER DEMONSTRATE THAT WE HAVE YEAH INCREASED ACCESS TO THE UNIVERSITY BY THIRTY ONE THOUSAND. OVER THIRTY ONE THOUSAND FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENT SO. IT'S A PRIORITY OF OURS AS WELL FOR SURE I THINK A CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE THAT'S SO UNIQUE THIS YEAR. IS THAT. THAT WITH THE WITH THE YEAR OVER YEAR DROP IN PROPOSED FUNDING FROM THE GOVERNOR. LAST YEAR HE PROPOSED ABORIGINE IN JANUARY HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE C. ISSUE AND THIS YEAR IT'S NINETY TWO IT'S A SIGNIFICANT DROP I THINK IT'S SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. SO WHAT THAT DOES IS THAT REALLY THAT EATS INTO WAR HOW DO YOU EAT. NOW WE'RE EATING INTO THE POINT OF. HOW TO COVER THOSE BASIC COSTS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE? LOCK DOWN IN TERMS OF CONTRACTS OR AND COST THAT WE'RE GONNA BE INCURRING FROM RATE INCREASES BY CALPERS FOR PENSIONS OR FOR HEALTH CARE. SO THAT'S WERE REALLY NOT REALIZING THIS POINT THIS IS REALLY A CHALLENGE. I THINK ULTIMATELY IT'S IT'S IT'S GOING TO BE BY THE END OF THE BUT IN THE PROCESS HERE. WE WE HOPE THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO TO SPREAD MORE OF THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM THE STATE TO ALL THESE OTHER. IN A AREAS INCLUDING ENROLLMENT. GRADUATION A SHIP AND INFRASTRUCTURE BUT THIS PET THIS JUNCTURE IT'S IT'S REALLY A DIRE SITUATION THAT RAN. OFFERED FOR THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN YEAR OKAY AND THEN A FOLLOW UP BURKE PERSEUS YOU. I DID YOU WANTTO MAYBE ADDRESS THAT THE ARRANGE WE HAD LAST YEAR FOR. FOR AN UNDERGRADUATE. ADMISSIONS IN THE POLICY THAT YOU KNOW. JUNIOR STUDENTS ENFORCEMENT GET GOT TURNED AWAY BUT WE WE ARE NOW GOING TO. GIVE ALL OF YOUR STUDENTS AT LEAST THAT GUARANTEE OF A SPOT AND ONE. I CAMPUS AND SO HOW IS THAT GOING TO WORK OUT. WELL I THINK RIGHT NOW WE'RE STILL IN THE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT. IF. YOUR STAFF FOR OTHERS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING. OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES HAS HAD NUMBER OF OF THAT HEARING SIR ACTUALLY I. ITEMS THAT THEY'VE DISCUSSED. ON A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS ON ONE THING THAT I THINK IS CHALLENGING ROM RIGHT NOW IS IS THAT WE HAVE THREE THINGS IN PLAY AT MINIMUM. ONE YOU HAVE THE ELIGIBILITY STUDY ARE BASICALLY SAYING THAT WE ARE. CARPOOL IS FORTY ONE PERCENT RIGHT SO WERE WERE GRAPPLING WITH THAT PARTICULAR ITEM. I WERE ALSO GRAPPLING WITH THE NOTION OF. THERE'S A COUPLE OF POLICY STATEMENTS THAT COME THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR WANTED US TO TO DEVELOP ONE OF THOSE BEING TO READ DIRECTOR CAMPUSES THAT MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL PASSED THE THE OTHER THING IS TO. PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ACCESS FOR LOCAL STUDENTS AT THEIR LOCAL CAMPUS. IN ON TOP OF ALL OF THAT THERE'S THE NOTION THAT. WITH TIGHT BUDGETS IT'LL BE TOUGH TO. KEEP KEEP IT WRONG THAT WHERE IT IS. SO RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ABOUT A STANDING BODY THAT'S ALWAYS WORKING ON THIS IS CALLED THE MISSION ADVISORY COUNCIL. IT'S A CROSS SECTION OF THE UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY THEY ARE VIGOROUSLY MEETING DEBATING ARE DISCUSSING HOW TO BLEND ALL OF THESE. ISSUES INTO ONE COHESIVE POLICY THAT WILL WORK BEST FOR THE C. ISSUE. THAT'S A LOT OF BACKGROUND BASICALLY SAY IT'S STILL TO BE DETERMINED. A A SEVEN MEMBER MCCARTY. WE HAVE. LIKELY AN ACTION ITEM IN MARCH AND SO BY THAT POINT I THINK THE COMMITTEE WILL HAVE THE COUNCIL OF HAD. NETWORK UNDER ITS UNDER ITS BELT. WHERE THEY CAN NAM PUT TOGETHER OUT OF A PROPOSAL I THINK THAT WILL BENEFIT? TODD STATE AND OUR STUDENTS A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN OUR CURRENT. A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN OUR CURRENT SITUATION WE'RE IN. OKAY. THANK YOU AND AND I WILL NOT TO JUST FOR THE UC AND CSU I THINK IN YEARS PAST TO WE WE HAVE. A FOUGHT FOR INCREASES ABOVE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET I WORK IN IT NO REASON WE WHEN CAN YOU DO SO. THIS YEAR AS WELL WITH BUT STILL THINK THE GOVERNOR IT IS CORRECT THAT WE WON AT. LOOK ABOUT WAYS WE CAN TIGHTEN THE BELT BUT AS FAR AS THE GRADUATION RATES AND WOULD YOU SEE AS OUR AUDITOR POINTED OUT AND WE TALKED LAST TO RETHINK THEIR SON. EFFICIENCIES IN IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THERE'S YOU KNOW UPWARDS OF THREE QUARTERS OF A BILLION DOLLARS IN. PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN EARMARKED FOR THIRTY YEARS SON SOME ARE GREAT SOME LOOK GOOD ON PAPER BUT I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE A TOUGH CHOICE. IN THE BUDGET CLIMATE WHAT'S OUR HIGHEST AND BEST USE OF THAT SCARES DOLLAR MAYBE. AND ROLLING AYE MORE CALIFORNIA KIDS IS A CHOICE WE WANNA FOCUS ON SO THAT'S A CONTINUING. CONTINUED ISSUE I I I DO WANT TO ASK YOU ONE POINT. ABOUT THE. YOU THE CHARTS YOU HAVE THERE ON THE. THAT THIS STUDENT TO FACULTY RATIO YOU SAID THAT BY GOING DOWN. OF ONE FOUR POINTS. AS FAR AS I'M TO BETTER. FACULTY TO STUDENT RATIO WOULD COST I THINK TO WONDERING EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS TO GO FROM TWENTY ONE TO ONE AND. YOU KNOW WE AYE AYE WE'D RATHER HAVE YOU KNOW SERVE TWENTY THOUSAND MORE CALIFORNIA KIDS BUT THEN YOU WOULD ARGUE THAT STUDENTS ARE SERVE BETTER HAVING A BETTER STUDENT TO FACULTY. RATIO BUT AS THE NUMBER HAS GONE UP YOUR GRADUATION RATE. HAS SUCCESS RATE HAS GONE DOWN SO HOW HOW DO YOU. RECONCILE US TWO POINT SO YOU THE IN OTHER WORDS IT WORK YOUR CUP WITH WHERE THANK WE LIVE PER LAMENTING THAT WE HAVE. A MORE STUDENTS. IN A CLASS. PER FACULTY IN THE LAST DECADE BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR EARLIER CHARTS THE UNIT THE GRADUATION SUCCESS RATE FOR THOSE STUDENTS HAS GOTTEN BETTER. BUT HAD HAD YOU ANSWER THAT. WE WE DO THINK THAT STUDENTS WOULD BE BETTER SERVED IN SETTINGS WHERE THEY HAVE MORE ACCESS TO A FACULTY MEMBER IN SUCH SETTINGS. UNDERGRADUATES CAN HAVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESEARCH OR DISCUSSION THAT THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE IF THEY'RE IN A LECTURE HALL WITH. THREE OR FIVE HUNDRED OTHER STUDENTS SYSTEM WIDE WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE FOR OVERALL QUALITY LONG TERM. TO AT LEAST KEEP THE STUDENT TO FACULTY RATIO OF FLAT. WE HAVE MADE GRADE. GREAT STRIDES IN INCREASING. STUDENT SUCCESS AT UC GRADUATION RATES AMONG OUR UNDERGRADUATES ARE UP. MUCH OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH OUGHT TO INCREASES IN STUDENT SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE ON OUR CAMPUSES. SO THERE ARE SPECIALIZED TUTORING THERE'S. NEW A WE HAVE STARTED STUDENTS CENTERS ON CAMPUSES WHERE STUDENTS CAN COME IN GET PURER. GUIDANCE AND MENTORING. THAT ALSO HELPED THEM DURING THEIR DURING THEIR TIMES IN SCHOOL BUT WE THINK IT'S A. GREAT GOAL FOR THE SYSTEM TO HAVE TO FIGHT TO WIN. TO REDUCE OUR STUDENT FACULTY RATIO BUT WE REALIZE IT'S PROBABLY NOT REALISTIC FOR THIS COMING YEAR YEAH I KNOW LOGICALLY IT MAKES SENSE. BEING IN A CLASS WITH THAT THAT. PROFESSOR AND THIRTY STUDENTS BETTER THAN BEING A CLASS WITH THE. IN THREE HUNDRED STUDENTS. BUT AS THE ALEJO POINTED OUT IN THE SAME TIME WHEN THE RATIO INCREASED THE YEAR GRADUATION RATES FOR A FOUR YEAR SWEAT FROM. A FORTY FIVE PERCENT TO SIXTY FIVE SO. MAYBE THE STUDENTS ARE MORE THESE MONIES ARE MORE RESILIENT AND PERSISTENT THAN THAT. THAN THAT PRIOR GENERATIONS WE DO HAVE THE BEST STUDENTS THERE WE GO. OKAY SO WITH THAT LET'S GET TO THE STUDENTS. AS FAR AS PUBLIC COMMENT AND HOPE I'M SORRY MISTER MARTZ IT YES THANK YOU. START WITH TO THE STUDENTS YOU CAN. WE LEARN MORE. ALONE HERE. THERE'S. RIVER TENANT YES TODD YOU KNOW CHANCE TO LOOK AT THE LA ROSA HIGHER EDUCATION ANNOUNCES. I HAVE LOOKED AT IT I HAVEN'T STUDIED EVERY PORTION OF IT IN DETAIL BUT I WILL DO MY BEST TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I WANTED TO ASK YOU THE SAME QUESTION ASKED LA O. IF YOU CAN TURN TO. PAGE TWELVE. WRITTEN VIGOR SEVEN. I I THINK THIS IS A. A SOFTBALL THAT I'M TALKING TO YOU BUT I. I I SEE THIS DRAMATIC DROP. IN THE PER PUPIL FUNDING. FROM AROUND TWO THOUSAND. AND AND AND THAT. YEAH YOU SEE WE ARE FAR FROM RECOVERING FROM THE PEAK IN PER PUPIL FUNDING. YES. A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM. ADDED EIGHTY EIGHT THOUSAND NEW STUDENT ASSISTANCE TWO THOUSAND OKAY THAT IS SO DRAMATIC ODD NUMBER OF MORE STUDENTS THAT YOU'RE DIVIDING THOSE RESOURCES IT'S GOOD CLEAN. UP ALSO OUR STATE GENERAL FUND IS NOW ONLY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS MORE IN ACTUAL DOLLARS WHEN IT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND SO YOU'RE TAKING THOSE RESOURCES AND DIVIDING THEM BETWEEN MORE STUDENTS WHAT THIS DOES. IS IT SHIFTS THE BURDEN OF THE INCREASED COST IN EDUCATION ON TO STUDENT FEES. SO COMING SO WE DO HAVE FEWER FUNDS TO EDUCATE OUR EACH INDIVIDUAL STUDENT BY. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THIS CHART DOES NOT SUBTRACT IT DOESN'T SURPRISE THE FACT THAT WE HAD OF MANDATORY RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WERE BROUGHT BACK GONE. IN TWENTY TEN. YOU SEE HAD TAKEN QUITE A LONG BREAK IN YOU SEE RETIREMENT PROGRAM FROM CHARGING A. ITSELF OURSELVES FOR. THE. RETIREMENT BENEFITS OF WE HAVE PROMISED OUR EMPLOYEES THOSE WERE RESTARTED AND ARE NOW AT FOURTEEN PERCENT OF PAYROLL. SO IT'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT THAT CANNOT GO TO HIRING NEW EMPLOYEES OKAY. AND THEN ANOTHER THING THAT'S NOT BEING SUBTRACTED HERE IS TO FINANCIAL AID ALLOCATION OF THAT. THE UNIVERSITY PROVIDES OUT OF ITS OWN FUNDS TO OUR STUDENTS. ALRIGHT THANK YOU THAT GIVES ME A WEB. DEEPER APPRECIATION OF. OF AT THIS CHART I I JUST WANTED TO UP. SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER THAT. AND MY DISTRICT ALSO. THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN I HERE IS ACCESS AND THAT WE JUST HAD A HEARING. THAT THIS COMMITTEE. HOSTED ABOUT THE NEED FOR. YOU KNOW A LOT MORE CAUSE AGREES A LOT MORE COLLEGE EDUCATED GRADUATES TO MEET THE WORKFORCE DEMANDS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND A WHILE I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S. EFFORTS TO. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ACHIEVING EFFICIENCIES AND AND AND AND TO. SAVE COSTS IS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE I ALSO. SURE. MR MEDINA IS FRUSTRATION THAT THAT WE HAVE. BEEN PLAYING AROUND WITH THE. YOU KNOW. THREE PERCENT HERE FOUR PERCENT HOW THEIR. WOULD I I I THINK THAT THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE NEED TO BE EDUCATING A LOT MORE. A COLLEGE GRADUATES. IN AND THAT THE WAY TO DO THAT IS BY INCREASING OUR HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITMENTS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY YOUR TESTIMONY AND WE'LL SEE YOU BACK IN OUR. FOLLOW UP HEARINGS WITH THAT. WE WILL PROCEED WITH THAT PUBLIC COMMENT YOU COULD LINE UP IN THE MIDDLE. OF THE ROOM. HOME COURT ADVANTAGE BY CS YOU. YEAH. OKAY WE'RE GOING TO ASK EVERYBODY TO KEEP THEIR COMMENTS TWO TO ONE MINUTE. ONE MINUTE COMMENTS PLEASE THANK YOU ALRIGHT I'LL TRY IT AFTERNOON AT YOUR MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE BUDGET SUB TO A COMMITTEE MY NAME'S JENNIFER EGAN I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION WE REPRESENT THE OVER TO TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND PROFESSORS LECTURES LIBRARIANS COUNSELORS AND COACHES. WHO TEACH AND MENTOR STUDENTS IN THE CSU SYSTEM? THE COMMITTEE RECENTLY HOSTED A HEARING ON THE DEGREE GAP DURING WHICH THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA STATED THAT CALIFORNIA IS ON PACE TO BE OVER ONE MILLION COLLEGE GRADUATE SHORT. CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY BY TWENTY THIRTY. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL OF MORE DEGREES WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON. EQUITY ACCESS AND ECONOMICS FIRST OFF EQUITY. SEE AFFAIRS REPORT EQUITY INTERRUPTED SHOWS THAT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM EDUCATES A FAR MORE DIVERSE STUDENT BODY TODAY THAN IT DID THIRTY YEARS AGO. AND THAT AS THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS OF COLOR HIS INCREASED PUBLIC FUNDING FOR THE CSU HAS DECREASED. NEARLY THREE QUARTERS A OF OUR STUDENTS IDENTIFY AS STUDENTS OF COLOR. FUNDING FOR THE CSU IS NOT ONLY A MATTER OF CREATING CLASS MOBILITY BUT IT FOSTERS RACIAL JUSTICE AS WELL AND JUST TO BE CLEAR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT COIN. FAILING TO SUFFICIENTLY FUND THE CSU IS TO ACTIVELY WORSEN ALREADYEXISTING RACIAL DISPARITIES. THE SECOND ISSUE IS ACCESS AND WE KNOW FOR WE KNOW THAT THE CSU TURNED AWAY THIRTY ONE THOUSAND QUALIFIED STUDENTS THIS PAST YEAR DUE TO FUNDING. AND ACCORDING TO THE CSU ZONE OWN NUMBERS TWENTY TO THIRTY THOUSAND STUDENTS EACH YEAR OVER THE LAST SIX. A AND. A. PERHAPS IN CONTRAST. DOES TO THE UC NINETY FOUR PERCENT OF CSU STUDENTS ARE FROM CALIFORNIA. SO WE BELIEVE REASONABLY SO THAT THIS TREND WILL ONLY GET WORSE WITHOUT A SIGNIFICANT BUDGET AUGMENTATION. THESE ARE LIFE CHANCES MISSED BY REAL YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WERE PROMISED A SEAT AT A FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY. THIS IS ALSO CERTAINLY A CRISIS FOR CALIFORNIA'S LONG TERM ECONOMIC WELL BEING. AT SO AS YOU ARE AWARE THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED UNDER FUNDING THIS THIS YES YOU WITH NINETY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. THIS THE CSU IS YOU HEARD REQUESTED TWO HUNDRED SIXTY THREE MILLIONDOLLARS AND MY ORGANIZATION CFA IS RECOMMENDING. OF FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY TWO POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS SO IN SHORT. YOU MIGHT WONDER WHY THE DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE IT IS YOU DOUBLE TIME. ALRIGHT SO GREAT APPETITE THE CURRENT. BUT IF IF THE STATE REALLY WANTS TO PREPARE FOR THE NEXT DOWNTURN IT SHOULD DO SO BY INVESTING IN PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION. WORKERS FEEL OUR ECONOMY PEOPLE WITH FOR YEARS DEGREES ARE PARTICULARLY VALUABLE TO ARE PARTICULARLY VALUABLE AND DEGREES HELP LIFT PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY. IF YOU AGREE THAT BUDGET IT THAT BUDGETS ARE MORAL DOCUMENTS AS I THINK THAT YOU DO. I WOULD CERTAINLY HOPE THAT YOU WOULD AGREE THAT FUNDING THE DREAMS OF THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES TWENTY THREE THOUSAND FAMILIES JUST THIS PAST YEAR ACCOUNTING. OF FOR THEIR CHILDREN TO EARN A DEGREE IS MONEY WE'RE SPENDING THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON SUSAN GREENER PRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION. I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE. JENNIFER IAN THAT THE CSU FUNDING REQUEST IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS SHORT. IN A PARTICULAR CONCERN TO ME IS WHAT HAPPENS TO NOT ONLY A THROUGH G. ELIGIBLE STUDENTS WATER TURNED AWAY BUT ALSO COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. AS THE PP I SEE NOTED ARM WE NEED A RADICAL INTERVENTION IN A SENATOR WERE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MIRCHI SAID WE NEED A RADICAL INTERVENTION. INTO. THE HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING SYSTEM. AND IN THE CSU WERE EXPECTED TO TAKE AN ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND TRANSFER STUDENTS FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. IF WE ARE GOING TO ACHIEVE THAT ONE POINT ONE MILLION DEGREE FOR YOUR DEGREE SHORT FALL. PROTECTED BY THE PP I SEE. AND WITHOUT ADEQUATE FUNDING WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES NOT ONLY ABOUT THE INVESTMENT IN COMMUNITY COLLEGES BUT ALSO THE INVESTMENT IN THE RECEIVING INSTITUTIONS. OTHERWISE THE TRANSFER INITIATIVES THE ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHETHER IT WORKS OR NOT OWNED THE GUARANTEED GUIDED PATHWAYS WILL BE FOR NAUGHT BECAUSE STUDENTS WILL HAVE A GUARANTEED SEAT. TO ABSOLUTELY NO WHERE WE NEED TO GUARANTEED GENERATIONS OF STUDENTS ON A FUTURE FOR THE FUTURE DRIVERS OF THE STATE ECONOMY. IT'S SHORT SIGHTED AND AS ARE JENNIFER ALLUDED TO IT'S AWFUL ALSO RACIALLY UNJUST I'M AT THE VERY MOMENT THAT THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION IS FIGHTING AGAINST POLICIES THAT ARE COMING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WE DON'T LIKE THAT ARE RACIST. NATIVIST OF AND ARE HURTING OUR STUDENTS WERE HURTING THOSE VERY SAME STUDENTS BY NOT INVESTING IN THE CSU AND OFFERING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACHIEVE THE FOUR YEAR DEGREES THAT THEY DESERVE. THANK YOU. I'M CECIL CANTON. GOOD AFTERNOON THAT HE'S. JERRY MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. WE ARE WELL ONE MAIN COLLEGE GRADUATES SHORT. COMMITTED DEMANDS OF OUR OF OUR STATE HAS STATE'S ECONOMY. THIS IS AN ISSUE IN LARGE PART DUE TO. NOT CHEST GRADUATION. BUT ALSO TO ACCESS WHO THE STUDENTS. IN OUR WHITE PAPER. HARD TO SEE IF A WHITE PAPER ECKLEY INTERRUPTED. TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A FAR MORE DIVERSE. A STUDENT BODY THAT WE HAVE THIRTY YEARS AGO. IN FACT IN THE PAPER WE SAY THAT. AS THE STUDENT BODY GOT DARKEN. THE FUNDING GOT LIGHTER. THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH. BUT WE KNOW THAT WE TURNED AWAY LAST YEAR FROM THIRTY ONE THOUSAND STUDENTS FROM THE CSU. I AM WE BEEN TURNING AWAY SIX TO SEVEN THOUSAND STUDENTS EVERY YEAR FOR THE LAST SIX OR SEVEN YEARS. THE. MANY WHO WERE TURNED AWAY. WERE UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS. WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT FACT THAT THESE ARE FOLKS WHO NEED CHANCES. TO GET INTO. ODD THE ECONOMY FAITH THEY DESERVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE EDUCATED. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED UNDER FUNDING THE CSU WITH A NINETY TWO MILLION A BALLOT OUT A AMOUNT. WHILE THAT WHILE THE CSU BRICK REQUESTED TWENTY SIXTY THREE MILLION AND OUR ORGANIZATION AS IT WAS AS WAS MENTIONED. RIP ARE RECOMMENDED FOR TO TWENTY TWO MILLION. IF THE STATE REALLY WANTS TO PREPARE. FOR THE NEXT DOWNTURN. IT SHOULD DO SO BY INVESTING IN PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION. AND IT SHOULD DO THAT BY ALSO IDENTIFYING A LONG TERM DEDICATED FUNDING SOURCE. THAT CAN BE USED FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. IF WE DON'T DO THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING AS AS A MR MEDINA HAS SAID. WITH THE THREE AND FOUR PERCENT. AND NOT REALLY ADDRESSING THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU THANK YOU. HI EVERYONE MY NAME IS MORE THANKED US AND I AM A STUDENT FROM A SACRAMENTO STATE. OF I'M AN ETHNIC STUDIES IN ASIAN AMERICAN AND. WOMAN'S MAJOR AND I AM HERE TO WITH THIS YEAR A AND STUDENTS FOR QUALITY EDUCATION. HERE TO PROVIDE A STUDENT NARRATIVE AND.

AND THOUGH I RECOGNIZE THAT I HAVE PRIVILEGED I'M HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THE CSU BECAUSE I'M AN IMMIGRANT AND I'LL I WAS. IN A PLACE WHERE I HAD I DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION. BUT KNOWING THAT THE PRIVILEGE THAT I HAVE IS TAKEN AWAY JUST BECAUSE WE'RE UNDER FUNDED A SOMETHING RIDICULOUS. SO YOU KNOW I WANT TO FORMALLY ASK YOU TO STAND WITH ME I'M IMMIGRANT STUDENTS PEOPLE. PEOPLE OF COLOR AND STUDENTS ALL OVER IT THE CALIFORNIA JUST LIKE ME OR. ARE WORKING HARD AND WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO STUDY WE DON'T HAVE BECAUSE WE WAKE UP OR GO TO SCHOOL.

TODAY WHEN AM A THOUGHT AND I'M A STUDENT AT SAC STATE. AND YOU KNOW GROWING UP. IN SOUTH SACRAMENTO ALL HAVE WONDERFUL EVER WANTED WAS TO BE A SACRAMENTO STATE WARNING BUT NOW THAT I'M HERE I COULD BARELY AFFORD IT I COME FROM A HOUSEHOLD THE SIX WHERE I HOUSEHOLD INCOME IS TWENTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS. APPEARS TO HAVE A RETIREMENT FUND IS NOTHING SAVE FOR THE FUTURE ALL THE MONEY WE HAVE GHOST OF FOOD AND BILLS FOOD AND BILLS FOOD AND BILLS. AND LIKE OTHER CSU STUDENTS I STRUGGLE BECAUSE WE ARE NOT FACTS AND FIGURES WE ARE FLESH AND BONE AND WHEN WE ARE UNDER FUNDED WE HURT WE HUNGER WE STRUGGLE AND LIKE YOU MISTER MEDINA I AM TIRED OF HIM WHAT HE CAN'T DO BETTER. AND. YOU KNOW CSU EDUCATION MEANS THAT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO TAKE CARE MY FAMILY OF MY PARENTS IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO GO BACK TO SOUTH SACRAMENTO IS A TEACHER. WHERE YOU KNOW KIDS THAT LOOK LIKE ME ARE SEVENTY PERCENT OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES BUT ONLY FORTY PERCENT OF COLLEGE ATTENDEES WE CAN DO BETTER? AND BY NOT FUNDING THE CSU YOU KNOW TAKEN AWAY JEAN TO TAKEN WHERE FUTURE SO PLEASE FIND US FUND THE DREAM WE CAN DO BETTER WE DESERVE TO DO BETTER THANK YOU THANK YOU. HI GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYBODY CHAIR TRUTH HAVE ON THE CAL STATES IN ASSOCIATION WE REPRESENT ALL CSU STUDENTS ON WE WERE VERY DISAPPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REQUEST AND ARE ASKING YOU ALL TO SUPPORT. THE CS USEFUL. A FULL BUDGET REQUEST AT AT MINIMUM. STUDENTS ARE FACING THE SECOND YEAR OF A TUITION INCREASE AND THEY'RE EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AND I WANTED TO REFERENCE REALLY QUICK WHAT THE LA L. I'M HAD IN THEIR. IN THEIR PRESENTATION THE PURPOSE. THE FUNDING PER AT THE NUMBERS AND SAY THAT WHILE. BUT THEY ASSERT THAT IT'S REMAINED STEADY SINCE THE NINETEEN NINETY ONE TUITION HAS NEARLY TRIPLED IN THAT TIME SO WE KNOW THAT STUDENTS ARE TAKING ON A LARGER BURDEN OF FUNDING THE INSTITUTION. WERE ASKING THAT YOU ALL SUPPORT THIS ISSUES BUDGET REQUEST THIS YEAR AND ALSO ADDRESS THIS LONG TERM TREND OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST SIXTY YEARS THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M JAKE RENDER I'M WITH YOU CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA AT LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR REMARKS THAT I REALLY NEEDED A WAKE UP CALL FROM THE. EXISTING CONVERSATION AROUND FUNDING AT OUR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY JOINS MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE IN OUR OTHER. COMMENTERS HERE. CALLING FOR THE NEED FOR EXPANDED ACCESS TO THE YOU SEE IN THE SEE IF YOU LAST YEAR WE PUBLISHED A REPORT CARD ON HOW IS CALIFORNIA DOING TO CLOSE THE DEGREES GAP THAT WAS CITED. EARLIER IN THIS HEARING UNFORTUNATELY WE HAD TO GIVE OUR STATE OF CALIFORNIA ON F. GRADE AND THAT'S DRIVEN IN LARGE PART BY THE LACKING CAPACITY AT OUR FOUR YEAR ON INSTITUTIONS OF OUR. OF PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE STUDENT FOCUSED FUNDING FORMULA PROPOSED BY GOVERNOR BROWN AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MEANS OF INCORPORATING EQUITY. AND STUDENT SUCCESS CONCERNS INTO THE CURRENT WAY THAT WE PORTION FUNDING FOR OUR COLLEGES SO THAT WE CAN BOTH GET ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO THE STUDENTS THAT NEED IT. AS WELL AS MAKE SURE THAT STUDENT SUCCESS IS KEPT AT FOR OF EVERY A CONVERSATION WE HAVE AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE AT DISTRICT LEVELS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HELLODIMERA KHAMENEI REPRESENTING THE LOS RIOS CALLS FEDERATION OF TEACHERS CALIFORNIA FEDERATION TEACHERS AND THE FACT ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA'S ME COLLEGES. SO THE TRUCK WILL BE ABOUT ME COLLEGES SO MANY THINGS I TALK ABOUT A LIMIT MY COMMENTS IN JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE. IS THAT IN TERMS OF THIS NEW FUNDING FORMULA YOU WOULD THINK THAT THE CD ó YOU HAVE A DISCUSSION CONCERNING THIS ISSUE WITH THE CEOS CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS. I BELIEVE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING GROUPS ACADEMIC SENATE AND ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS IN COMMITTEE COLLEGES TO TALK ABOUT THIS NEW FUNDING FORMULA. AND THEN BROWN SIMULATIONS THAT TEST HOW THIS NEW FUNDING FORMULA WOULD AFFECT THE BUDGET OF CAMINO COLLEGES BEFORE CAME TO A BUDGET BILL. NOT IN THIS CASE. NOW THEY'RE HAVING A TASK FORCE TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW THEY CAN FIT THIS OF THIS FUNDING FORMULA WITH JUST THE CEOS. OKAY NO CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS NO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING GROUPS NO ACADEMIC SENATE NO OTHER STAKEHOLDERS WERE ALL SHUT OUT THE PROCESS. THAT'S NOT THE WAY THAT I THINK THAT YOU DO THIS TYPE OF KEY BUDGETING ITEM. SOMETHING WITHIN A THREE MONTH PERIOD AND YOU'RE GONNA GET SOMETHING THAT RISK GOING TO REALLY TRULY WORK THE WAY YOU INTENDED TO. I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE WAY THAT IT SHOULD BE DONE. THE OTHER THING WOULD BE I IN TERMS OF I THINK MR MEDINA YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND THIS WHEN YOU OPEN UP A CALLS PORTS WHERE THERE'S. OR ON GRANT. YOU HAVE NO CONTROL WITH AN OPEN ACCESS OPEN ENROLLMENT SYSTEM OF WHO'S GOING TO TAKE THOSE COURSES. SO WHEN YOU OPEN UP THIS ONLINE COLLEGE CLASS HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT THE ONLY STUDENTS THERE ARE GOING TO ROLL IN THERE. ARE COME FROM THAT TWO POINT FIVE MILLION STUDENTS THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE THOSE CLASSES THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE THAT'S A DREAM. THIS IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN SO THIS IS NOT VERY WELL THOUGHT OUT ADULT BECAUSE ESPECIALLY WITH IT'S AN ONLINE CLASS. THAT EXACERBATES THE PROBLEMIT DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY BETTER. FOR THOSE TARGETED POPULATIONS TO POPULATIONS THE LAST THING I'LL SAY JUST THEM CHO SHORT. THIS THIS IS A COLLEGE THAT WILL NOT BE ACCREDITED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS FIGURE THEY'RE GONNA BE TAKING THESE CLASSES THEY'LL NEVER TRANSFER. TO ANOTHER ALCHEMY COLLEGES ARTISTS YES YOU YOU SEE BECAUSE I'M NOT ACCREDITED INSTITUTION DETAIL TAKE FORTY EIGHT YEARS TO GET ACCREDITATION. FROM THEIR CREDIT MISSION. RIGHT NOW SO I YOU KNOW THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM THEY THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD CONSIDER. ON TERMS OF THIS SEPARATE NEW ONLINE COLLEGE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MY NAME IS HARSHA SURVEY SURE AND I AM A SECOND YEAR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY. WITH ME TODAY ARE ABOUT TWENTY STUDENTS FROM THE UNIVERSITAT TODAY THEY'RE GONNA TELL YOU THEIR OWN STORIES BECAUSE AS YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA AND YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. AMMONIA NOTED SO ELOQUENTLY WE NEED A CENTER STUDENT VOICES IN THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE WE ARE BEING LEFT OUT. SO TODAY YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT HOW DECADES OF STATE DISINVESTMENT INCLUDING DISINVESTMENT THAT WAS CAUSED BY POLITICAL DISPUTES BETWEEN THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE GOVERNOR. HOW THAT DISINVESTMENT HAS DEEPLY IMPACTED STUDENTS NEGATIVELY ON OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES? YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT HOW ON MY CAMPUS ONE HALF OF OUR STUDENTS FACE. FOOD INSECURITY AND A QUARTER AND ONE FIFTH FACE HOUSING INSECURITY AT SOME POINT IN THEIR CAREER THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY. AND YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT ON MY CAMPUS HOW BECAUSE OUR FINANCIAL AID OFFICES SO POORLY FUNDED AND SO POORLY STAFFED MANY OF OUR STUDENTS DON'T GET THEIR FINANCIAL AID PAYMENTS ON TIME AND ARE CONSEQUENTLY DROPPED FROM THEIR COURSES. AND OR EVICTED FROM THEIR APARTMENTS. AND THESE ARE DEEPLY PERSONAL STORY SO I ASK THAT WHEN YOU HEAR THEM YOU DON'T GO ON YOUR PHONES THAT YOU PAY THE STUDENTS THERE. THE DETENTION THAT THEY DESERVE BECAUSE ALL THE MISSED THEIR CLASSES TO BE HERE AND THAT WAS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME EMOTIONAL LABOR ON THEIR PART. US THE REST OF MY PEERS AND I SINCERELY HOPE THAT YOU TAKE OUR TESTIMONY AND ACCOUNT AND THAT WHEN THE BUDGET PROCESS UNFOLDS THAT YOU ADVOCATE FOR INCREASED FUNDING FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM. WE A STUDENTS AS ORGANIZERS AND AS VOTERS WILL BE LOOKING TO YOU WE WILL BE WATCHING YOU AND WE PLAN ON HOLDING YOU ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE ALL OF YOU TALK A GOOD GAME BUT COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY. BUT IT IS TIME FOR YOUR ACTIONS TO MATCH YOUR RHETORIC THANK YOU SO MUCH. GRIEVING EVERYONE MY NAME IS THAT NASH IRE I'M A FIRST YEAR FROM UC SANTA CRUZ. TIME AND TIME AGAIN WE'VE BEEN TOLD I'M A STUDENTS ASPIRING TO PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION WITH IN CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO THE BEST COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. AND SO THE ACCOLADES THE RESEARCH ACHIEVEMENTS MAY ALL SEEM TO ECHO THE SENTIMENT BUT ARE. A DISTRACTION THE FACE OF THE REALITY IN THE THROUGH TRUTH OF THE SITUATION AND SOME GOING TO BE VERY HONEST I'M SEVERAL FOLKS HERE BODY CONVEYED. THE SENTIMENTS. AND WILL CONTINUE TO ECHO THE SENTIMENTS AS PART OF THE AYE DELEGATION FROM THE YOU SEE. ATTENDING A YOU SEE AND FOR THAT MATTER ANY PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM IN CITIES IN CALIFORNIA IS NOT ACCEPTABLE IS NOT AFFORDABLE ON AS A FRESHMAN I AM SUPER SUFFERING IN OTHER STUDENTS IS SUFFERING FROM. THE COST OF OVER NORMAN A DIRECT RESULT OF WHAT WAS MANDATED BY THE STATE LAST YEAR ON UC SANTA CRUZ IS NEAR IN HOSPITAL BECAUSE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO EDUCATE. EACH ADDITIONAL STUDENT MANDATED TO BE ENROLLED BY THE UC ON IS NONEXISTENT SKIPPING MEALS SKIPPING CLASSES ARE ALL COMMONALITY FOR MYSELF AND MY PEERS. OVERCROWDED BUSES OVER CROWDED DINING AREAS CLASS IS THE INABILITY TO EVEN REGISTER FOR CLASSES PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE OUR MAJORS THAT ARE IMPACTED. ALL A COMMON A COMMONALITY FOR UC SANTA CRUZ AND ARE YOU SEE INSTITUTIONS YOU SEE WHY. I'M IN SO I'M ASKING YOU ALL AS OUR LEGISLATORS AYE TO FUND US. SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN DENIED FOR YEARS AND IT'S NOT A PASS FOR Y'ALL TO DIRECT US TO YOU CALL FOR THE REGION'S BECAUSE WE ARE ASKING YOU AND WILL HOLD YOU RESPONSIBLE AS. WAS ECHOED BY MAY PIER BEFORE. YOU'RE ALL HERE AND YOU'VE YOU KNOW TALKED A GOOD GAME ABOUT FUNDING US BUT LIKE MY PEERS SAID BEFORE IT IS TIME FOR YOU ALL TO TAKE ACTION AND ACTUALLY ACT ON THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. IN THIS THREE HOUR COMMITTEE SESSION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. JOE MCCARTY IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ROGER ROBINSON I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING THE FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS AT UC BERKELEY IS EXTERNAL AFFAIRS VICE PRESIDENT OF THEIR STUDENTS ASSOCIATION. ACTIONABLE LECTURE THE STARTS AT FIVE PM TODAY BUT I DECIDED TO BE A BETTER USE OF MY TIME TO COMEADDRESS YOU BECAUSE I KNOW THAT UNLESS I SHOW UP EARLY. I LITERALLY WON'T HAVE A SCENE LIKE THIS ON THE AISLE ON THE FLOOR. OVERCROWDED CLASSROOMS ARE JUST ONE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF UNDER FUNDED MANDATES FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH ACROSS THE SYSTEM BUT A FAR MORE SERIOUS AND DIRE ONE IS A SHORTAGE OF AVAILABLE HOUSING. BERKELEY IS THE UC CAMPUS IT CURRENTLY HOUSES THE SMALLEST CHAIR OF ITS STUDENTS OUR CAMPUSES MOST RECENT HOUSING SURVEY INDICATES A TEN PERCENT OF UC BERKELEY STUDENTS WILL EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS AT SOME POINT DURING THEIR TIME AT BERKELEY. WE DON'T HAVE THE PHYSICAL ROOM OR THE FUNDS TO BUILD MORE HOUSING AND GETS THE STATE CONTINUES TO ASK FOR MORE ENROLLMENT GROWTH FROM US. YOU SEE WAS BUILT ON PRINCIPLES OF ACCESS AFFORDABILITY AND QUALITY BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK BEYOND JUST ACCESS UNFUNDED ENROLLMENT GROWTH IS DECIMATING THE QUALITY OR EDUCATION AND THE AFFORDABILITY OF COSTS OF ATTENDANCE. YEAR AFTER YEAR THE UC HAS ANSWERED THESE FUNDING NEEDS BY INCREASING TUITION BUT THIS IS GONE ON FOR FAR TOO LONG AS THE REGION'S REALIZED AT THEIR LAST MEETING. THIS YEAR THE UC STUDENT ASSOCIATION AND THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT ARE COMING TO YOU TO DEMAND MORE FOR THE UC. BUDGETS ARE STATEMENT OF VALUES STATE TRULY VALUES THAT YOU SEE IN HIGHER EDUCATION IT WILL GRANT US THE FULL FOUR PERCENT INCREASE IN FUNDING THAT WE ARE EXPECTING. STATE TRULY VALUE SO YOU SEE IT WILL ENSURE THERE IS FUNDING GRANTED FAR RECENT ENROLLMENT GROWTH AND FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE COSTS NEITHER OF WHICH IS ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET. BUT A HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS YOU THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING EVERYONE I'M TELLING FAMILY FIGURE UNDERGRADUATES TODAY UC IRVINE I'M HERE TODAY TAKING TIME WHEN I COULD BE STUDYING FOR MY MIDTERMS OUT THAT SHE WRITING A PAPER ON THE FLIGHT ON THE WAY CARE. AND I'M HERE NOT ONLY TO REPRESENT MYSELF BUT ALSO TO EACH THOUSAND OF MY FELLOW AND EATERS AT IRVINE. I'M HERE TO ASK BY LEGISLATORS PEOPLE THAT WE AS VOTERS AND STUDENTS. TO PUT THAT WE PUT OUR TRUST IN YOU TO REPRESENT US AND TO INVEST IN HIGHER EDUCATION NOT ONLY FOR OURSELVES BUT FOR THE FUTURE. GENERATIONS COME YOU SEE IS CURRENTLY AT FULL CAPACITY OF CURRENT FUNDING BARELY ABLE TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE RESOURCES FORCE CURRENT STUDENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA I MEAN. LIKE THE SAID LIKE I SEE MY FELLOW CLASSMATES SITTING ON THE FLOOR OF A LECTURE HALLS THEY'RE SLEEPING IN THE LIBRARIES THERE. SUBSIDING THEMSELVES ARE JUST COFFEE AND CHIPS ALONE AND I NOT ONLY SEEN I'M EXPERIENCING THAT WE'RE ALL EXPERIENCING THIS ARM. AND ALSO THE COST OF EDUCATION IS NOT JUST TUITION LOANS ALSO ACROSS THE PDIF HAVING TO LIVE AS A PERSON HAVING TO PAY FOR ALL THE THINGS HAVING TO GO THROUGH. FOOD INSECURITY HOUSING INSECURITY ALL THE STUFF AND ALSO THE FACT THAT I'M A PROUD CHILD OF AN OF IMMIGRANTS MY PARENTS CAME HERE IN ORDER TO GIVE MYSELF BETTER. OPPORTUNITIES AND GET MY YOUNGER SIBLINGS BUT OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL BUT THE THING IS. HOW CAN WE AFFORD TO THAT WHEN THE STATE IS UNWILLING TO INVEST IN OUR EDUCATION THANK YOU? THANK YOU. AFTERNOON WHEN HE WAS THERE REALLY THINK HE DOES. I AM A JUNIOR AT UC IRVINE AS WELL. AND. I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA SOUND LIKE A BROKEN RECORD I DON'T EVEN OWN AGREED THAT IS THE SAME THING THAT ALL OF MY PEERS HAVE BEEN MENTIONING IS WHAT WE'RE ALL EXPERIENCING. ALL OF MY FRIENDS ARE DEALING WITH THAT IT'S EXHAUSTING IT'S EMOTIONALLY DRAINING IT'S MENTALLY DRAINING WAS SUPPOSE TO BE FOCUSING ON EDUCATING OURSELVES. AND WE CAN'T BECAUSE ALREADY THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN BE AFFECTS QUARTER. OUR HOUSING WE HAVE TO PLAN A YEAR IN ADVANCE ARE WE GONNA BE ABLE TO AFFORD EVERYTHING THAT WE WANT TO DO IN ORDER TO GRADUATE ON TIME. AND THEN BE ABLE TO GET A JOB AFTERWARDS IT'S EXHAUSTING. OUR UNIVERSITY ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE A LOT OF ISSUES. PRIOR TO THE FALL OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. DUE TO STUDENTS ARE BEING THREATENED TO BE RESCINDED. FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS TOTAL ACTUALLY. AND BECAUSE OF OUR STUDENT EFFORTS THEY WERE ALLOWED TO ATTEND THE UNIVERSITY BUT THEN WE SUFFERED OF THE STUDENT BODY. ALL OF OUR RESOURCES ARE. LIKE IT'S RIDICULOUS OUR BUSES ARE OVERCROWDED WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH BUSES I VERY. OF HOUSING IS A BIG ISSUE ESPECIALLY IN IRVINE ORANGE COUNTY IS VERY EXPENSIVE OUR DORMS ARE NOT ADEQUATE. EVERYTHING IS JUST A MASS OF MASS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY AND WE'RE EXHAUSTED WE'RE TIRED OF ASKING FOR THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I'VE SEEN COUSINS OVER THE PAST DECADE DEAL WITH THE THEME ISSUES OF THE UC AND YOU WOULD THINK THAT IT WOULD OF GOTTEN BETTER BY NOW AND. I HOPE THAT YOU TAKE ARE STRUGGLING TO HEAR. CONSIDERATIONS THANK YOU. HELLO. MY NAME IS SARAB CHINA SECOND YEAR AT UC BERKELEY. THE UC WAS FOUNDED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF ACCESSIBILITY AND AFFORDABILITY BUT IN REALITY THE YOU SEE EXHIBITS NEITHER. AND THAT'S BECAUSE STUDENTS HAVE BECOME THE PRIMARY FINANCIAL STAKE HOLDERS OF THE UC AND THE REGIONS ARE STILL CONSIDERING RAISING OUR TUITION BECAUSE THE STATE BUDGET DID NOT COVER DEFERRED MAINTENANCE COSTS OR FUNDING FOR INCREASED ENROLLMENT. YOU SHOULD BE GETTING A COPY OF STUDENT TESTIMONY IS TESTAMENT O. SHORTLY SHOULD BE COMING AROUND RIGHT NOW. THERE YOU'LL FIND STE. STORIES FROM PEOPLE LIKE HONEY WHO OR ANY HOUSEWORK OVER TWENTY HOURS A WEEK TO SUPPORT HERSELF OR FROM PEOPLE LIKE JAY WHO IS ALREADY OVER THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS DEEP IN STUDENT LOANS. THEY HAVE MANY PEERS IN THE SAME BOAT AND THEIR SITUATION WILL BE WORSE IF TUITION INCREASES AND LET ME CLARIFY THAT TUITION IS NOT GOING TO RAISE BECAUSE OF ADMINISTRATIVE BLOAT IT'S GONNA RAISE BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF SUPPORT FROM THE STATE'S. STUDENTS OR TO CONTRIBUTE MORE TO CAR FUNDS IN THE STATE DOES SO I HAVE A HARD TIME CALLING BERKELEY THE NUMBER ONE PUBLIC UNIVERSITY IN THE WORLD WHAT IS NOT REALLY FUNDED BY THE STATE. WE'VE OUR STATE FUNDING WE NEED IT NOW AND WE NEED IT FOR THE LONG TERM SO WE'LL BE WATCHING WILL BE SKIPPING CLASS TO BE HERE. AND WILL BE VISITING YOUR OFFICES AND BE MAKING SURE THAT YOU ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND THAT YOUR ACTIONS MATCH YOUR RHETORIC WE URGE YOU TO FUND THE UC AND ONCE AGAIN A HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE GREAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU. HELLO ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE MY NAME IS KILEY MURDOCH AND I'M A SECOND YEAR AT UC BERKELEY EMERGE GOING FROM TORRANCE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLYMEMBER MERTZ OFF MARZI SHE'S DISTRICT. CALIFORNIA IS ARGUABLY THE BEST STAY IN THE U. S. BUT WE CURRENTLY RANKED FIFTIETH IN EDUCATION. IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM WE NEED TO INVEST IN IT THE UC REGENTS RECENTLY PROPOSED INCREASING OUR TUITION IN ORDER TO FUND THE YOU SEE. HOWEVER TUITION INCREASES MAKE HIGHER EDUCATION LESS ACCESSIBLE AND WE TOLD THE REGENTS THAT WHEN WE WENT TO THEIR LAST MEETING. YOU SEE PRESIDENT NEPAL TANA AGREED TO PUSH OFF TUITION INCREASES AND WORK WITH US TO LOBBY FOR INCREASED FUNDING SO HERE WE ARE. IN BERKELEY I CURRENTLY LIVE IN TO DOUBLE THAT IS MEANT TO BE A SINGLE AND I PAY EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH IN RENT. ON TOP OF TUITION AND FEES AND RENTS I HAVE TO PAY FOR TEXTBOOKS AND GROCERIES AND TRANSIT COSTS. TO KEEP THE UC SYSTEM ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE WE NEED THE STATE TO INCREASE FUNDING FOR THE UC SYSTEM WE WILL BE WATCHING OVER THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS TO SEE IF YOUR ACTIONS SUPPORT HERE. RHETORIC OF SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SYNDICATES DE ON BEHALF THE FACULTY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE DISTRIBUTED OUR BUDGET LETTER OUTLINING OUR CONCERNS BUT VERY BRIEFLY ON THE ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WE BELIEVE A MORE EFFECTIVE WAY TO TARGET. A THAT POPULATION WOULD BE TO REJECT THE PROPOSED FUNDS TO INS INSTEAD INCREASE THE ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE. WE'VE ALSO PROPOSE ALTERNATIVE METRICS ON THE FUNDING FORMULA WHICH MOVES AWAY FROM PERFORMANCE BASED FUNDING WHICH WE FEEL WHAT EXASPERATED ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. AND FOR CLOSE OPPORTUNITY ON STUDENTS WHO ARE DEEMED HIGH RISK. FINALLY AND LIKE TO ECHO CHRISTIANS EARLIER COMMENTS IN ASKING FOR FUNDING FOR FULL AND PART TIME FACULTY AND STUDENT SIR STUDENT SERVICES. THESE COMPONENTS ARE CRITICAL TO THE COMMUNICATIVE AS WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION THANK YOU. IF YOU.

I'M ALSO A DELEGATE AT THE CP AND WILL BE VOTING HAS WEAKENED. I THINK ITS FIRST WELL FRANKLY OFFENSIVE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR HAVE ESSENTIALLY THE ONLINE ACCREDITATION PROGRAM. WHEN WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO BE A MILLION A COLLEGE GRADUATE SHORT VERY SHORTLY. BUT WHAT I WANT TO REALLY TALK ABOUT TODAY'S. HOW FAILURE FROM THE UC EXACERBATE OUR HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA? SO AT UC BERKELEY. WE ARE. WE CAN BARELY AFFORD AND BARELY HAVE ROOM TO HOW THE FIRST. A LITTLE ON THE OTHER STUDENTS OF METAL EDGE OF. AND THAT NOT ONLY IS INCREDIBLY IMPACTFUL OF STUDENTS AND I KNOW STUDENTS WHO GOT INTO UC'S HAVE GOOD GRADES. THEY COULD AFFORD THE TUITION BUT COULDN'T FOR THE RENT AND THAT'S A SHAME A DAMN SHAME. BUT IT ALSO HAS A SEVERE IMPACT ON THE CITY'S BUT HOST OR UC'S AND A FEW ISSUES. BECAUSE THEY CANNOT. WHEN STUDENTS CAN'T GET HOUSING ON CAMPUS THEY'RE FORCED INTO THESE COMMUNITIES WHICH ALREADY HAVE MASSIVE MASSIVELY. YOU KNOW BERKELEY IT'S PART OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE HOUSING MARKET IN THE WORLD. AND WHEN STUDENTS ARE FORCED INTO THOSE HOUSING MARKETS. IT RAISES RENTS FOR EVERYBODY. AND I KNOW THIS LEGISLATURE TOOK A VERY BRAVE STEP LAST A SESSION. INCLUDING FORD VERY UP IN FRONT OF HOUSING PACKAGE. GOING FORWARD THAT PASSED TO INCLUDE FUNDING FIRST. IT MUST OTHERWISE WE WILL NOT SELL OR HAVING. I'M I AM YOUNGER THEY LOOK MY BEARD IS YOU KNOW DEFINITELY LITTLE THE MAN BUT I WILL BE AT MANY CONVENTIONS IN THE FUTURE. AT THE CP AND I WERE MEMBER WHO WILL STAND WITH STUDENTS IN WHO DID NOT AND WHO ARE ON THEIR PHONES WHILE THEY TALKED. AND I WILL BE VOTING. SO I THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION AND THANK YOU FOR RAISING FUNDING FOR THAT YOU GET AT THEM. HELLO MUCH LIKE KEVIN MCCARTY I'LL BE LOOKING AT MY PHONE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRETY OF THIS.

MY NAME IS MAX LUBIN I'M A STUDENT AT UC BERKELEY AND I'M ONE OF MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS WITH RISE CALIFORNIA WHO ARE FIGHTING TO BRING FREE COLLEGE BACK TO OUR STATE. YOU'VE HEARD FROM COUNTLESS STUDENTS ABOUT HUNGER AND HOMELESSNESS SO MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS NOT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES IT'S ABOUT. WHY WE'RE SPENDING FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ON A RAINY DAY FUND THAT STUDENTS CAN AFFORD? THAT'S WHY WE'RE SPENDING BILLIONS MORE ON ROADS AND INFRASTRUCTURE INSTEAD OF ADDRESSING STUDENTS NEEDS. QUESTION IS WHY CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST PAID PRISON GUARDS IN THE NATION INSTEAD OF INVESTING IN STUDENTS WHO WILL PAY MUCH LONGER DIVIDENDS TO OUR STATE. WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU TO SOLVE THESE ISSUES IF ADMINISTRATIVE BLOAT IS THE PROBLEM YOU CAN LEGISLATE YOUR WAY OUT OF THAT PROBLEM WE CAN SOLVE IT TOGETHER.

GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS DANA ALPER I'M A JUNIOR AT UC BERKELEY I'M AYE SERVICE IN OUR A IN THE UC BERKELEY DORMS AND AS SUCH GET A FIRST HAND OUTLOOK ON THE CONSISTENT ISSUES THAT ARE INCOMING STUDENTS FACE. ON ONE OF THOSE IS VERY PROBLEM IT'S FOOD INSECURITY ON THE MEAL PLANS FAR CURRENT FRESHMAN INCOMING STUDENTS SUPPORT AB TWO MEALS A DAY ONE ON THE WEEKEND. I CANNOT TELL YOU THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE MY RESIDENTS HAVE COME FOR TO ME. TELLING ME ABOUT HOW THE SKIP MEALS ABOUT HOW THEY'RE FACING FOOD INSECURITY AND HOW IT'S AFFECTING THEIR EDUCATION. WE HAVE POLICIES HERE AT UC BERKELEY THAT'S DROPS TUNES FROM THEIR CLASSES IF THEY HAVEN'T PAID A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THEIR TUITION ON TIME. AND YET OUR FINANCIAL AID OFTEN ISN'T DISPERSED UNTIL THE END OF THE SEMESTER. THAT PAIRED WITH RISING TUITION COSTS FORCES STUDENTS TO FOCUS ON THEIR FINANCIAL INSTABILITY OVER THEIR EDUCATION. I MYSELF WORKED TWO JOBS ON CAMPUS AND MY PARENTS RECENTLY CAME PORTS ME TALKING ABOUT THEIR WORK SITUATION AND NOW I WILL HAVE TO LOOK FOR A THIRD JOB ON CAMPUS BY THE END OF THE SEMESTER. REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW TO BE ABLE TO BALANCE THAT WITH A FULL COURSE LOAD AND WE'LL TRY TO GET RELEVANT. EXTRA CURRICULAR AND JOB OPPORTUNITIES BUT I'M GONNA HAVE TO MAKE IT WORK IN ORDER TO GET AN EDUCATION WITH AN ARGUES THE SYSTEM. WE HAVE TO THINK BACK TO WHAT WAS THE UC FOUNDED UPON IT WAS FOUNDED UPON ACCESSIBILITY AFFORDABILITY AND INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE. RISING TUITION COSTS AND DECREASE STATE FUNDING DO NOT REFLECT ANY OF THOSE VALUES THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HI I'M A VALUES VANESSA PARADIS I'M A SECOND YEAR YOU SEE VERY BERKELEY STUDYING ECONOMICS.

HI MY NAME IS NEAR MCCLINTIC AND THE JUNIOR TRANSFER UC BERKELEY AND A FORMER STUDENT AT DE ANZA COMMUNICABLE ITCH. HAVING EXPERIENCED MULTIPLE FACETS OF THE HIGHER ED SYSTEM COMMITTEE COLLEGE AND NOW YOU SEE BERKELEY. I CAN SAY THAT THE RECURRING THEME THAT SADDENS ME MOST IS SEEING FELLOW PEERS HAVE TO WORRY SO MUCH ABOUT FOOD HOUSING FINANCIAL SECURITY WHEN THEY SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON BEING A STUDENT. THE LABOR THAT GOES INTO THE POPE FOCUSING ON BEING A STUDENT IS TOO SEVERE TO HAVE TO ALSO WORRY ABOUT MAJOR BUDGETING. AS A STUDENT MYSELF BUDGETING COMING FROM A SINGLE PARENT HOUSEHOLD IN WHICH RECENTLY MY FAMILY CONTRIBUTIONS HAVE SICKNESS SIGNIFICANTLY DROPPED. I AM UNABLE TO QUALIFY FOR ADEQUATE FINANCIAL AID WHILE ALSO HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT FINANCIAL SECURITY. ANY PLANS INVOLVING A POSSIBLE TUITION INCREASE AYE A THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THREATENS THE SECURITY MYSELF AND MANY OTHER STUDENTS. LAST LAST MONTH MYSELF AND MANY OTHERS IN THIS ROOM RISK BEING DROPPED FROM OUR CLASSES BECAUSE WAS WENT WITHIN THE FIRST FEW WEEKS OF SCHOOL. TO GO TO THE UC REGENTS MEETING. THOUGHT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO MYSELF AND OTHERS. AND WE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING THAT DELAYED INCREASE BUT THEIR ULTIMATE PLANS ARE DEPENDENT ON WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS ROOM AND ONWARD. THE BALL IS IN YOUR COURT NOW AND WE HOPE YOU STAND WITH STUDENTS OF THE STATE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME STRUCK US ALL WHEN I AM A JUNIOR TRANSFER FROM.

TO THE UC SYSTEM FOR ME THAT CAME RIGHT AT THE START A UC BERKELEY INSTEAD OF BEING EXCITED FOR ONE OF THE MOST BEST OPT BIRD BEST UNIVERSITIES IN THE WORLD. I WAS TOO CONCERNED WITH TRYING TO FIND A PLACE TO SLEEP AT NIGHT. THIS WOULD OFTEN BE ON FRIENDS COUCHES OR AT THE SCHOOL LIBRARY. SCRAMBLING TO FIND A PLACE I ENDED UP SIGNING THE LEASE FOR A FIVE BEDROOM APARTMENT THAT COSTS OVER SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. THAT'S FOR ELEVEN MONTHS. I OFTEN HAVE TO RELY ON FOOD PANTRY TO EAT BUT THIS ISN'T SOMETHING I FACE ALONE. OVER FORTY EIGHT PERCENT OF YOU SEE STUDENTS A REPORT FACING OF FOOD INSECURITY SO WHEN I SPEAK OF THE DIRE NEED OF PROPERLY FUNDING THE UC SYSTEM I SPEAK NOT ONLY FOR MYSELF.

THE CURRENT. ONLINE EDUCATION THE SHOULD HAVE ALREADY DIES WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH WE WANT YOU TO EXPAND ON THAT PROGRAM.

GOOD EVENING JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION TAKE THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME OUT OF YOUR EVENING. I'D LIKE TO NOTE. TWO PARTICULAR ITEMS ON IT WEEK IN REGARD TO THE FUNDING FORMULA. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE. THAT PERFORMANCE BASED METRIC WHAT WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSIDER ON ONE OF THE AND PANEL MEMBERS TODAY MENTION STUDENT SUCCESS METRICS AND ACCESS TO FACULTY. ENCOURAGES STUDENT SUCCESS SO WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT CHANGING SOME OF THE pSOME OF THOSE FUNDING FORMULAS AND ALSO AND CHOOSE TO THROUGHOUT BECAUSE THERE ARE NUMBER OF COMPLEXITIES THAT WE'RE NOW REALIZING WITHIN THE K. TWELVE TIED. ON THE LC FF. I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO ASK THE QUESTION. IS THE CURRENT UP POSE WILL GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO ASSUME THE INCREASE COSTIKYAN COLLEGE DISTRICTS ARE GOING TO BE FACING IN THE FUTURE IS THAT GOING TO BE. NOT JUST MINIMAL ADEQUATE AND IS THAT GOING TO ENABLE COMMUNICATE USED TO BE TRULY SUCCESSFUL YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD A NUMBER OF ISSUES REGARDING ONLINE. BUT WHAT I WOULD KNOW IS HOW WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT FINDING THE BEST WAY TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S LAID OUT. BUT WE'RE VERY CONCERNED WITH SOME CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WHEN IT COMES TO PROP NINETY EIGHT. AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE CONSTITUTIONAL CONFLICTS WITH A STRUCTURED PROPOSAL FOR HOW THAT SYSTEMS INITIALLY SET UP WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IS IMPERATIVE MEETING COMFORT IS NOT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH. DISCUSSIONS UNLESS WE ENSURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ACCESS TO LEVER ORGAN TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL FACULTY ARE GOING TO BE PROPERLY REPRESENTED. THE ONLINE PROPOSAL ITSELF IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT UPON PART TIME TOO MANY COLLEGE FACULTY AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY PART TIME COMMITTEE COLLEGE FACULTY DO NOT ALWAYS HAVE ACCESS TO OFFICE HOURS. AND SO IF YOU'RE GONNA RELY PREDOMINANTLY ON A PART TIME POPULATION ARE YOU CAN ENSURE THAT STUDENTS WHO DISPROPORTIONATELY MAY NEED EVEN MORE SUPPORT FROM THE FACULTY. ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE OUR ACCESS TO THE FACULTY THAT THEY'RE SERVING WILL BE SHARING MANY OF THESE COMMENTS BUT WANTED TO NOTE THAT WE HAVE SOME STRUCTURAL CONCERNS THAT NEED TO BE WORKED OUT.

MOVE FORWARD WE'D LIKE TO HAVE DISCUSSION REVOLVING AROUND TALKING IMMIGRANTS AS WELL NOT JUST TALK RECIPIENTS LINDA CHRISTIANS AS A WHOLE. VISIT AS A CHARACTER. THEN I RECEIVE FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID THERE WAS A LOAN PROGRAM INTRODUCED ABOUT WE SHOULD DO BETTER THAN OFFERING LOANS BECAUSE NOT ALL STUDENTS WITH WITHOUT DOCTOR CAN AFFORD TO HIRE. JOBS AFTER COLLEGE SO THIS IS JUST SOMETHING I HOPE YA CONSIDER. ODD THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT YOUR TESTIMONY FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND THAT WITH THAT WE WILL ADJOURN THE MEETING. I
