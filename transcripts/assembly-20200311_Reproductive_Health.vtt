AFRAID TO SPEAK OUT ABOUT THEIR

01:04:17.453 --> 01:04:20.289

THE SERVICES YOU KNOW THAT

REGARD TO AMBULANCE PROVIDERS-

01:05:58.254 --> 01:06:00.623
BUT THE QUESTION THAT YOU RAISE

01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:02.291
IN TERMS OF THE SCOPE IS VERY

01:06:02.358 --> 01:06:05.494
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE E. R. D.

01:06:05.561 --> 01:06:10.833
IS- THEY GOVERN ALL CONTRACTS-

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:12.635
THAT ARE MADE WITH CATHOLIC

GOVERNED BY THE ER DIS AND

THOSE THAT COLLABORATE AN

01:06:20.376 --> 01:06:21.877
AFFILIATE WITH THEM ARE THEN

NURSES THAT'S CRITICALLY

01:06:33.155 --> 01:06:36.025
IMPORTANT IN MEANS THAT THE

01:06:36.092 --> 01:06:38.461
TRAINING THAT INDIVIDUAL.

01:06:38.527 --> 01:06:41.330
RECIEVE MAY VERY WELL WENT BY

01:06:41.397 --> 01:06:43.933
THAT INSTEAD OF WHAT HAPPENS TO

01:06:43.999 --> 01:06:46.635
BE THE GOLD STANDARD IN TERMS

01:06:46.702 --> 01:06:47.903
OF MEDICAL TREATMENT AND ONE

01:06:47.970 --> 01:06:50.005
EXAMPLE THAT I GAVE WAS. WITH

01:06:50.072 --> 01:06:52.775
REGARD TO A RATE IT IS THE GOLD

01:06:52.842 --> 01:06:55.611
STANDARD BUT AFTER A RAPE- THE

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:58.314
INDIVIDUAL IS COUNSELED ABOUT

01:06:58.381 --> 01:07:00.916
EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION AND

01:07:00.983 --> 01:07:02.218

I AT A CATHOLIC HOSPITAL

01:07:06.856 --> 01:07:07.890
BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT

01:07:07.957 --> 01:07:09.392
SUPPOSED TO BE COUNSELED IN

01:07:09.458 --> 01:07:12.027
THAT WAY IT'S CONSIDERED A SAN

01:07:12.094 --> 01:07:14.029
AND CERTAINLY NOT PROVIDED.

01:07:14.096 --> 01:07:16.832

ONE CAN FIND A NUMBER OF CASES

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:37.420
JUST BY A VERY EASY SEARCH OF

01:07:37.486 --> 01:07:41.257

SPLIT DECISION IT WASN'T. IT

01:10:11.707 --> 01:10:14.209
WAS A SEVEN TO TWO OPINION IN

01:10:14.276 --> 01:10:15.444
NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE. JUSTICE

BLACKMUN WROTE THE OPINION FOR

01:10:17.646 --> 01:10:19.515
THE COURT JUSTICE BLACKMUN WAS

01:10:19.582 --> 01:10:21.317
A REPUBLICAN HE WAS APPOINTED

01:10:21.383 --> 01:10:23.686
BY RICHARD NIXON. AND IT'S

01:10:23.752 --> 01:10:24.753
IMPORTANT IN READING THE

01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:28.190
DETAILS OF THE CASE THE HISTORY

01:10:28.257 --> 01:10:29.592
THAT. JUSTICE BLACKMUN BROUGHT

01:10:29.658 --> 01:10:32.428
TO BEAR IN THE CASE. AS HE

01:10:32.494 --> 01:10:33.996
INFORMED THE COURT AND ALL

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:35.397
THOSE WHO. READ THE CASE SENSE

01:10:35.464 --> 01:10:37.866
THAN ABORTION I HAD BEEN LEGAL

01:10:37.933 --> 01:10:42.371
IN U. STATES IT IS A LOT

01:10:42.438 --> 01:10:46.108
HISTORY THE PILL IS A PRESS. OF

01:10:46.175 --> 01:10:49.511
MAN. AND THREE. HEALTH CARE AND

01:10:49.578 --> 01:10:53.315

MOVE. HAVE ALL. STRONG

01:11:08.864 --> 01:11:10.566
ITERATION ABOUT ABORTION IN THE

01:11:10.633 --> 01:11:12.334
UNITED STATES ACTUALLY CAME

01:11:12.401 --> 01:11:12.901
AROUND THE TIME OF THE CIVIL

01:11:12.968 --> 01:11:16.138
WAR. AROUND THAT TIME NEARLY A

01:11:16.205 --> 01:11:17.239
100% OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH

01:11:17.306 --> 01:11:18.107
CARE WAS BEING PERFORMED BY

01:11:18.173 --> 01:11:20.709
WOMEN WHO WERE MIDWIVES HALF OF

01:11:20.776 --> 01:11:22.811
WHOM WERE AFRICAN AMERICAN OR

01:11:22.878 --> 01:11:23.579
BLACK WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN

01:11:23.646 --> 01:11:25.381
FORMERLY ENSLAVED WHITE WOMEN

01:11:25.447 --> 01:11:27.449
IN NATIVE WOMEN AND IT WAS AT

01:11:27.516 --> 01:11:29.618
THE RISE OF GYNECOLOGY WAS KIND

01:11:29.685 --> 01:11:31.854
OF A PERFECT STORM. IT WAS THE

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:33.389
AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION

01:11:33.455 --> 01:11:35.090
SEEKING TO PUSH WOMEN OUT OF

01:11:35.157 --> 01:11:36.291
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE AND

01:11:36.358 --> 01:11:38.827
CARVE OUT A FIELD JUST FOR MEN

01:11:38.894 --> 01:11:40.496
SOUGHT TO CRIMINALIZE BOTH

01:11:40.562 --> 01:11:42.564
MIDWIFERY AND ALSO ABORTION AT

01:11:42.631 --> 01:11:44.266
THE SAME TIME. AND TO USE THAT

01:11:44.333 --> 01:11:46.702
PLATFORM THEN AS AN ANTI

01:11:46.769 --> 01:11:52.408
IMMIGRATION PLATFORM AS WELL.

01:11:52.474 --> 01:11:53.976

THING I HAVE TO GIVE US I'M-

01:11:58.480 --> 01:11:59.715
AND I THINK THAT ONE OF THE

01:11:59.782 --> 01:12:00.582
THINGS THAT WE NEED TO REMEMBER

01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:02.818
IS THAT IN THE WAKE THE ROE V.

01:12:02.885 --> 01:12:03.452
WADE CAME AT A TIME WHEN WOMEN

01:12:03.519 --> 01:12:07.423
WERE DYING. WHICH IS PART OF

01:12:07.489 --> 01:12:08.023
WHAT TOOK US TO WHERE WE WERE

01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:08.624
AT THAT POINT AND THAT THAT.

01:12:08.691 --> 01:12:09.224
THE RIGHT GUARANTEE UNDER ROE

01:12:09.291 --> 01:12:10.459
V. WADE THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY

01:12:10.526 --> 01:12:11.460
WHICH AS YOU SAID IS ALSO

01:12:11.527 --> 01:12:12.294
INCLUDED IN OUR CALIFORNIA

01:12:12.361 --> 01:12:14.763
CONSTITUTION. IS STILL RIGHT

01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:16.465
VERY MUCH PROTECTED. IN THIS

01:12:16.532 --> 01:12:19.201
STATE AND ACROSS THE NATION.

01:12:19.268 --> 01:12:22.271
I'M SO MY- QUESTION ABOUT- SOME

01:12:22.337 --> 01:12:24.273
THE LAWS THAT WE HAVE PASSED.

01:12:24.339 --> 01:12:25.741
SO I AM JUST LAST YEAR SIGNED

01:12:25.808 --> 01:12:27.242
INTO LAW SENATOR LIVE HIS BILL

01:12:27.309 --> 01:12:29.311
WHICH REQUIRES UC CAMPUSES TO

01:12:29.378 --> 01:12:31.380
PROVIDE EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION

01:12:31.447 --> 01:12:33.015
I AM CONFUSED FROM A LEGAL

01:12:33.082 --> 01:12:35.384
PERSPECTIVE HOW. AN AFFILIATION

01:12:35.451 --> 01:12:36.652
OF THE CASTLE CATHOLIC HOSPITAL

01:12:36.719 --> 01:12:38.687
UNDER WHICH UNDER CONTRACT LAW

01:12:38.754 --> 01:12:39.788
THEY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO

01:12:39.855 --> 01:12:40.756
COMPLY WITH THE CONTRACT WOULD

01:12:40.823 --> 01:12:42.958
INTERACT WITH OUR LEGISLATION

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:43.459
WHICH MANDATES PROVIDING

01:12:43.525 --> 01:12:45.227
CERTAIN SERVICES. IT'S AN

01:12:45.294 --> 01:12:46.795
EXCELLENT QUESTION WHAT IT

01:12:46.862 --> 01:12:50.165
REVEALS- HAPPENS TO BE THE

01:12:50.232 --> 01:12:52.434
TROUBLE THAT YOU SEE CAN'T OVER

01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:54.269
COM- OUT WITH THESE

01:12:54.336 --> 01:12:56.438
AFFILIATIONS- BECAUSE THE

01:12:56.505 --> 01:12:58.474
AFFILIATIONS MAKE VERY CLEAR

01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:01.777
THAT- THE WHAT GOVERNS THE

01:13:01.844 --> 01:13:04.246
RELATIONSHIP NOT JUST WITH THE

01:13:04.313 --> 01:13:05.814
UC BUT ANY OTHER INSTITUTION

01:13:05.881 --> 01:13:07.649
WILL IN FACT BE THESE RELIGIOUS

01:13:07.716 --> 01:13:11.320
DIRECTIVES. AND SO IF THE YOU

01:13:11.386 --> 01:13:14.356
SEE SIGNS CONTRACTS THAT ALLOW

01:13:14.423 --> 01:13:16.191
FOR THE RELIGIOUS DIRECTIVES TO

01:13:16.258 --> 01:13:19.228
GOVERN- WHAT IT IS THAT WE DO

01:13:19.294 --> 01:13:20.395
THEN THAT WOULD SEEM TO

01:13:20.462 --> 01:13:22.631
MAINTAIN THAT THE TYPES OF

01:13:22.698 --> 01:13:26.401
SERVICES THAT HAVE BEEN FOUGHT

01:13:26.468 --> 01:13:27.736
FOR OUR STUDENTS CANNOT BE

01:13:27.803 --> 01:13:30.773
PROVIDED FOR. IN THOSE

01:13:30.839 --> 01:13:32.341
INSTITUTIONS. IF YOU KNOW MY

01:13:32.407 --> 01:13:34.309
SENSE IS THAT THIS MAY NOT BE

01:13:34.376 --> 01:13:36.445
LOOKED AT AS A ZERO SUM GAME.

01:13:36.512 --> 01:13:39.114
IF IN FACT THE CHALLENGES THAT

01:13:39.181 --> 01:13:41.049
ODD THERE'S A NEED FOR MORE

01:13:41.116 --> 01:13:42.918
HOSPITAL BEDS IN CURRENTLY IN

01:13:42.985 --> 01:13:44.186
THE UNITED STATES ONE IN SIX

01:13:44.253 --> 01:13:45.754
HOSPITAL BEDS IS CATHOLIC IN

01:13:45.821 --> 01:13:48.123
SOME IN SOME CITIES IT'S EVEN A

01:13:48.190 --> 01:13:50.058
GREATER CONCENTRATION. IF OUR

01:13:50.125 --> 01:13:51.960
CHALLENGES THAT WERE NOT ABLE

01:13:52.027 --> 01:13:53.796
TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE

01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:56.331
THAT WE WANT TO SERVE THE

01:13:56.398 --> 01:13:59.802
DEFAULT ANSWER ISN'T THEN WE

01:13:59.868 --> 01:14:01.937
MUST FOLLOW CATHOLIC YARD

01:14:02.004 --> 01:14:02.805
TEASING AND- THE REAL QUESTION.

01:14:02.871 --> 01:14:04.573
IS HOW DO YOU. GO ABOUT

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:06.542
ACHIEVING THOSE AIMS AND HOW DO

01:14:06.608 --> 01:14:08.210
WE GO ABOUT DOING THAT WITH

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:10.012
REAL EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE AND

01:14:10.078 --> 01:14:12.648
INFORMATION- AND SO THAT'S

01:14:12.714 --> 01:14:14.483
WHERE I THINK THAT WE NEED TO

01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:16.552
BE THINKING AND NOT JUST SIMPLY

01:14:16.618 --> 01:14:18.253
WELL WE MUST. AFFILIATE WE

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:20.055
ACTUALLY DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW

01:14:20.122 --> 01:14:21.590
HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE NOT.

01:14:21.657 --> 01:14:23.325
SERVING OR COULD BE BETTER

01:14:23.392 --> 01:14:24.760
SERVED BUT ONCE WE ACTUALLY

01:14:24.827 --> 01:14:26.395
HAVE THAT DATA THEN WE CAN

01:14:26.461 --> 01:14:27.796
THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE THE TOOLS

01:14:27.863 --> 01:14:29.031
THAT ARE NECESSARY OR THAT

01:14:29.097 --> 01:14:30.833
SHOULD BE EMPLOYED. IN ORDER TO

01:14:30.899 --> 01:14:32.467
MAKE SURE THAT WE SERVICE

01:14:32.534 --> 01:14:35.604
PEOPLE. WITH THE VALUES THAT

01:14:35.671 --> 01:14:37.005
HAVE BEEN ARTICULATED THROUGH

01:14:37.072 --> 01:14:38.907
THE UC SYSTEM AND THROUGH THE

01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:40.943
STATE AND I AND I MUST SAY WHEN

01:14:41.009 --> 01:14:44.012
WE LOOK AT. OF MATERNAL

01:14:44.079 --> 01:14:45.080
MORTALITY AS I'VE MENTIONED

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:47.482
BEFORE WHAT MAKES CALIFORNIA

01:14:47.549 --> 01:14:49.218
SUCH A SPECIAL PLACE IS THAT

01:14:49.284 --> 01:14:51.620
CALIFORNIA HAS FOUGHT HARD TO

01:14:51.687 --> 01:14:53.589
SAVE AND PROMOTE AND PROTECT

01:14:53.655 --> 01:14:55.490
THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE THAT IT

01:14:55.557 --> 01:14:57.059
SERVES. YOU KNOW WHILE TEXAS

01:14:57.125 --> 01:14:58.360
HAS BEEN CONSIDERED ONE OF THE

01:14:58.427 --> 01:14:59.461
DEADLIEST YOU KNOW THE

01:14:59.528 --> 01:15:00.662
DEADLIEST PLACE IN THE

01:15:00.729 --> 01:15:01.763
DEVELOPED WORLD FOR PERSON TO

01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:04.566
BE PREGNANT. CALIFORNIA IN

01:15:04.633 --> 01:15:06.235
RECENT STUDIES IS CONSIDERED

01:15:06.301 --> 01:15:08.370
ONE OF THE SAFEST PLACES AND

01:15:08.437 --> 01:15:10.405
IT'S BECAUSE THE WORK THAT YOU

01:15:10.472 --> 01:15:11.640
DO IT'S BECAUSE OF THE VALUES

01:15:11.707 --> 01:15:12.908
THAT HAVE BEEN ARTICULATED IN

01:15:12.975 --> 01:15:15.544
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT

01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:16.078
WE CAN MEET THOSE KINDS OF

01:15:16.144 --> 01:15:18.881
GOALS. AND I READ THE- THE

01:15:18.947 --> 01:15:20.482
REPORT PUT OUT BY PRESIDENT OF

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:26.321
EMPIRICAL DATA FIGURING OUT HOW

01:15:26.388 --> 01:15:27.789
TO MEET THOSE SAME NEEDS ANY

01:15:27.856 --> 01:15:29.024
AND AGAIN TO YOUR POINT AT THE

01:15:29.091 --> 01:15:31.159
BEGINNING- CATHOLIC HOSPITALS-

01:15:31.226 --> 01:15:32.594
SERVING IMPORTANT EVEN PART OF

01:15:32.661 --> 01:15:33.862
OUR STATE IN PROVIDING CARE

01:15:33.929 --> 01:15:34.930
THAT IS CRITICAL AND WE DON'T

01:15:34.997 --> 01:15:36.832
WANT TO UNDERESTIMATE THAT- AND

01:15:36.899 --> 01:15:38.500
I UNDERSTAND THE GOALS THAT

01:15:38.567 --> 01:15:39.434
THOSE THAT LEAVES FILIATION

01:15:39.501 --> 01:15:40.802
WILL HELP HAS. HAS THERE BEEN

01:15:40.869 --> 01:15:42.070
CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO HOW TO

01:15:42.137 --> 01:15:43.805
ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS THROUGH

01:15:43.872 --> 01:15:44.439
DIFFERENT MEANS BESIDES

01:15:44.506 --> 01:15:48.377
AFFILIATION. NOW OKAY. THE

01:15:48.443 --> 01:15:50.045
SHORT ANSWER DOWN YES I THINK

01:15:50.112 --> 01:15:51.680
IT'S WORTH NOTING TO AN AND I

01:15:51.747 --> 01:15:53.916
KNOW THAT- I DIDN'T LIKE THIS

01:15:53.982 --> 01:15:55.083
MY REMARKS BUT- THE ATTORNEY

TRANSACTIONS IN THE STATE OF

WE DO NOT HAVE AUTHORITY OVER

01:16:10.198 --> 01:16:11.733
THE UC SYSTEM. SO WE GET THAT

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:12.567
THAT QUESTION A LOT WOULD WE

01:16:12.634 --> 01:16:13.635
DON'T HAVE AUTHORITY OVER THE

01:16:13.702 --> 01:16:15.170
UC'S THERE INDEPENDENT OF US.

01:16:15.237 --> 01:16:17.506
UNDER THE CONSTITUTION IT'S MY

01:16:17.572 --> 01:16:18.140
UNDERSTANDING WE CAN'T GIVE YOU

01:16:18.206 --> 01:16:21.076
THAT AUTHORITY. THAT WOULD BE.

01:16:21.143 --> 01:16:22.377
I MEAN THAT BEER READING OF THE

01:16:22.444 --> 01:16:23.545
CONSTITUTION I MEAN THE

01:16:23.612 --> 01:16:24.813
CONSTITUTION SAYS AS YOU READ

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:28.850

UNDERSTANDING I THINK IT'S IT

01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:37.125
COULD BE AN OPEN QUESTION OR

01:16:37.192 --> 01:16:41.029
ELSE OKAY. THANK YOU FOR THAT

01:16:41.096 --> 01:16:45.867
AT LET'S DISCUSS SO- AND THEN

01:16:45.934 --> 01:16:47.035
SO I JUST WANT TO LEAVE THE

01:16:47.102 --> 01:16:48.103
LAST QUESTION THAT I WOULD LIKE

01:16:48.170 --> 01:16:49.638
TO ASK IS WE HAVE TALKED A LOT

01:16:49.705 --> 01:16:53.308

HAPPENING ACROSS CALIFORNIA TO

01:16:59.881 --> 01:17:01.616
RE TO LEAD US TO THE PLACE

01:17:01.683 --> 01:17:04.353
WHERE THESE DENIALS OF CARE-

01:17:04.419 --> 01:17:06.054
ARE IMPACTING COMMUNITIES IN

01:17:06.121 --> 01:17:09.191
VERY REAL WAYS- AND SO I JUST

01:17:09.257 --> 01:17:09.992
WANT TO ASK EACH OF YOU TO

01:17:10.058 --> 01:17:12.294

01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:44.012
ONLY TREAT ME AT THE NEARBY

01:24:44.078 --> 01:24:45.413
MISSION HOSPITAL PART OF ST

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:47.582
JOSEPH HEALTH. WHICH REQUIRED

01:24:47.649 --> 01:24:49.651
THAT I UNDERGO A SERIES OF

01:24:49.717 --> 01:24:51.553
ADDITIONAL ULTRASOUNDS TESTS

01:24:51.619 --> 01:24:54.722
BLOOD WORK IN PAPERWORK TO

01:24:54.789 --> 01:24:55.323
ENSURE I WASN'T TRYING TO GET

01:24:55.390 --> 01:24:57.525
AN ABORTION. THE DOCTOR SAID

01:24:57.592 --> 01:24:59.661
THIS IS THE TREATMENT. THIS IS

01:24:59.727 --> 01:25:02.263
THE STANDARD. BUT THE HOSPITAL

01:25:02.330 --> 01:25:02.831
SAID THEY DON'T WANT TO BE A

01:25:02.897 --> 01:25:07.068
PART OF BACK. INSTEAD OF

01:25:07.135 --> 01:25:07.869
GETTING THE SIMPLE

01:25:07.936 --> 01:25:09.103
STRAIGHTFORWARD TREATMENT MY

01:25:09.170 --> 01:25:11.539
DOCTOR WANTED MY HUSBAND AND I

01:25:11.606 --> 01:25:13.475
FACED A WALL OF RED TAPE. AND

01:25:13.541 --> 01:25:15.176
DELAYING TREATMENT OF THE NECK

01:25:15.243 --> 01:25:17.078
TOPIC PREGNANCY WOULD HAVE TO

01:25:17.145 --> 01:25:19.113
PUT MY HEALTH AND LIFE AT RISK.

01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:20.081
IT WAS A QUESTION OF MY

01:25:20.148 --> 01:25:22.417
SURVIVAL VERSES AN EMBRYO

01:25:22.484 --> 01:25:24.419
THAT'S IN THE WRONG PLACE IT

01:25:24.486 --> 01:25:26.454
HAS NO CHANCE OF SURVIVING. FOR

01:25:26.521 --> 01:25:28.289
THEM TO PASS JUDGMENT TO

01:25:28.356 --> 01:25:29.757
QUESTION IF I'M JUST MAKING UP

01:25:29.824 --> 01:25:31.426
AN EXCUSE FOR TERMINATION IS

01:25:31.493 --> 01:25:33.761
INSULTING. THIS RELIGIOUS

01:25:33.828 --> 01:25:36.264
INSTITUTION OPPOSED THEIR

01:25:36.331 --> 01:25:37.565
VERSION OF MORALITY ON ME. I

01:25:37.632 --> 01:25:39.100
WAS SO ANGRY THAT THEY WERE

01:25:39.167 --> 01:25:40.134
TRYING TO SHE ME AND CALL ME A

01:25:40.201 --> 01:25:43.371
LIAR. INSTEAD OF GETTING

01:25:43.438 --> 01:25:44.706
MEDICALLY REQUIRED TREATMENT

01:25:44.772 --> 01:25:46.274
FOR MY DOCTOR IN THE HOSPITAL

01:25:46.341 --> 01:25:48.443
MY OWN COMMUNITY I HAD TO FIND

01:25:48.510 --> 01:25:51.279
A NEW OBGYN. AND UNDERGO A MORE

01:25:51.346 --> 01:25:52.814
INVASIVE PROCEDURE UNDER

01:25:52.881 --> 01:25:55.583
GENERAL ANESTHESIA. THE LOSS OF

01:25:55.650 --> 01:25:56.584
THE PREGNANCY WAS PAINFUL

01:25:56.651 --> 01:25:58.853
ENOUGH BUT THIS DELAY FORCED ME

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:00.922
TO TAKE TIME OFF WORK. AND KERR

01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:02.223
NOT ONLY ADDITIONAL MEDICAL

01:26:02.290 --> 01:26:04.659
EXPENSES BUT ALSO THE EMOTIONAL

01:26:04.726 --> 01:26:06.361
AND MENTAL BURDEN OF ANXIOUSLY

01:26:06.427 --> 01:26:07.929
WAITING TO TERMINATE A MUCH

01:26:07.996 --> 01:26:09.697
DESIRED PREGNANCY THAT COULD

01:26:09.764 --> 01:26:12.300
NOT SURVIVE. I WAS GOING

01:26:12.367 --> 01:26:14.102
THROUGH SUCH A HARD TIME AND

01:26:14.168 --> 01:26:16.471
THEY MADE IT WORSE. THIS

01:26:16.538 --> 01:26:18.106
SITUATION ROCK MY FAITH IN THE

01:26:18.172 --> 01:26:20.308
MEDICAL PROFESSION. AND IS MADE

01:26:20.375 --> 01:26:21.543
ME AND MY HUSBAND QUESTION

01:26:21.609 --> 01:26:24.345
WHETHER QUESTION WHETHER WE CAN

01:26:24.412 --> 01:26:24.879
CONTINUE TO TRY TO HAVE A

01:26:24.946 --> 01:26:27.448
FAMILY. WE'VE CONSIDERED GIVING

01:26:27.515 --> 01:26:28.716
UP BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO BE

01:26:28.783 --> 01:26:30.051
IN THE SITUATION IN WHICH WE

01:26:30.118 --> 01:26:31.886
ARE DENIED CARE BECAUSE SOME

01:26:31.953 --> 01:26:33.121
RELIGION WE DON'T EVEN BELONG

01:26:33.187 --> 01:26:36.190
TO. TELLS US WHAT MORALITY IS.

01:26:36.257 --> 01:26:38.259
WE ARE TELLING OUR STORY TODAY

01:26:38.326 --> 01:26:40.461
BECAUSE WE WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW

01:26:40.528 --> 01:26:42.897
THEY ARE NOT ALONE. THAT THEY

01:26:42.964 --> 01:26:43.831
DO NOT NEED TO TAKE ON THE

01:26:43.898 --> 01:26:46.100
JUDGMENT OR SHAMING OF THE

01:26:46.167 --> 01:26:46.734
PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO CARE

01:26:46.801 --> 01:26:49.504
FOR THEM. IF OUR STORY CAN HELP

01:26:49.571 --> 01:26:50.972
ONE PERSON FEEL LESS ALONE AND

01:26:51.039 --> 01:26:53.308
PERHAPS MAKE A CHANGE AND IT

01:26:53.374 --> 01:26:56.444
WILL BE WORTH IT. THANK YOU.

01:26:56.511 --> 01:26:57.412
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING

01:26:57.478 --> 01:26:59.347
THE POWERFUL STORY. I WILL TURN

01:26:59.414 --> 01:27:02.083
IT OVER TO MISS FRIEDMAN AND

01:27:02.150 --> 01:27:02.650
SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY OPENING

01:27:02.717 --> 01:27:05.420
REMARKS. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM

01:27:10.525 --> 01:27:12.660
THIS IMPORTANT HEARING TODAY.

01:27:12.727 --> 01:27:14.162
MY NAME IS LAURIE FRIEDMAN I'M

01:27:14.228 --> 01:27:15.597
A MEDICAL SOCIOLOGIST AND A

01:27:15.663 --> 01:27:17.398
BIOETHICIST. AND I'VE BEEN

01:27:17.465 --> 01:27:19.133
CONDUCTING RESEARCH ABOUT

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:20.702
CATHOLIC HEALTH CARE

01:27:20.768 --> 01:27:22.470
RESTRICTIONS FOR MANY YEARS.

01:27:22.537 --> 01:27:23.871
WHAT THAT RESEARCH HAS REVEALED

01:27:23.938 --> 01:27:25.406
HAS CONCERNING IMPLICATIONS FOR

01:27:25.473 --> 01:27:27.141
PATIENT AUTONOMY AND THE

01:27:27.208 --> 01:27:29.444
PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. CATHOLIC

01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:30.812
HEALTH INSTITUTIONS OCCUPY A

01:27:30.878 --> 01:27:32.180
SIZEABLE SECTOR OF THE WHOLE

01:27:32.246 --> 01:27:35.049
AMERICAN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM ONE

01:27:35.116 --> 01:27:36.884
OUT OF EVERY SIX HOSPITALS AS

01:27:36.951 --> 01:27:38.987
YOU HEARD- HOSPITAL BEDS IN THE

01:27:39.053 --> 01:27:39.954
UNITED STATES IS IN A CATHOLIC

01:27:40.021 --> 01:27:41.289
HOSPITAL WHERE OF THE RELIGIOUS

01:27:41.356 --> 01:27:43.591
POLICIES GOVERN CARE. HOWEVER

01:27:43.658 --> 01:27:45.727
IT IS QUITE VARIABLE BY STATE

01:27:45.793 --> 01:27:48.029
IN SEVERAL STATES ABOUT 30% OF

01:27:48.096 --> 01:27:49.664
HOSPITAL BEDS ARE IN CATHOLIC

01:27:49.731 --> 01:27:50.965
INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING FOR

01:27:51.032 --> 01:27:53.768
EXAMPLE OHIO COLORADO ILLINOIS

01:27:53.835 --> 01:27:57.438
AND IOWA. OVER 40% OF HOSPITAL

01:27:57.505 --> 01:27:58.973
BEDS ARE IN CATHOLIC FACILITIES

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:01.776
IN WASHINGTON STATE ALASKA

01:28:01.843 --> 01:28:03.911
SOUTH DAKOTA AND WISCONSIN.

01:28:03.978 --> 01:28:05.146
NATIONALLY THE CATHOLIC SECTOR

01:28:05.213 --> 01:28:06.047
OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM HAS

01:28:06.114 --> 01:28:07.882
EXPERIENCE CONTINUOUS GROWTH

01:28:07.949 --> 01:28:10.818
SINCE THE NINETIES- EVEN AS

01:28:10.885 --> 01:28:12.754
OTHER SECTORS START TO SHRINK

01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:14.255
PART OF THAT GROWTH HAS COME

01:28:14.322 --> 01:28:15.423
FROM MERGERS ARE PARTNERSHIPS

01:28:15.490 --> 01:28:16.891
OF SECULAR INSTITUTIONS FURTHER

01:28:16.958 --> 01:28:18.526
ROADING OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE WHO

01:28:18.593 --> 01:28:20.628
NEED ACCESS TO THE FULL RANGE

01:28:20.695 --> 01:28:22.363
OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES.

01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:23.731
AT THIS POINT THE PROPORTION OF

01:28:23.798 --> 01:28:24.565
CATHOLIC HOSPITALS IN

01:28:24.632 --> 01:28:26.401
CALIFORNIA SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE

01:28:26.467 --> 01:28:28.503
NATIONAL AVERAGE. I HAVE

01:28:28.569 --> 01:28:30.238
CONCERNS ABOUT ACCESS TO

01:28:30.304 --> 01:28:33.141
COMPREHENSIVE CARE. IN OUR

01:28:33.207 --> 01:28:36.077
STATE IF THEY CONTINUE TO GROW.

01:28:36.144 --> 01:28:37.779
MODERN CATHOLIC HOSPITALS A

01:28:37.845 --> 01:28:38.613
COME TO LOOK AND FEEL LIKE MOST

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:42.350
OTHER US HOSPITALS WHAT MAKES

01:28:42.417 --> 01:28:43.518
THEM UNIQUE IS THAT. CATHOLIC

01:28:43.584 --> 01:28:45.753
HOSPITALS MUST FOLLOW THE US

01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:47.422
BISHOPS RELIGIOUS POLICIES FOR

01:28:47.488 --> 01:28:48.656
CARE AS YOU HEARD ABOUT THE

01:28:48.723 --> 01:28:49.223
ETHICAL AND RELIGIOUS

01:28:49.290 --> 01:28:50.692
DIRECTIVES FOR CATHOLIC HEALTH

01:28:50.758 --> 01:28:52.260
CARE SERVICES SOMETIMES CALLED

01:28:52.326 --> 01:28:54.962
THE RD'S. THESE POLICIES

01:28:55.029 --> 01:28:56.898
RESTRICT A BROAD RANGE OF CARE

01:28:56.964 --> 01:28:58.566
INCLUDING CONTRACEPTION

01:28:58.633 --> 01:28:59.667
STERILISATION FERTILITY

01:28:59.734 --> 01:29:01.269
TREATMENT MISCARRIAGE

01:29:01.335 --> 01:29:03.204
MANAGEMENT GENDER AFFIRMING

01:29:03.271 --> 01:29:05.540
CARE AND OF COURSE ABORTION.

01:29:05.606 --> 01:29:07.408
THE IRAQIS DON'T SIT WELL WITH

01:29:07.475 --> 01:29:09.010
MANY DOCTORS A NATIONAL SURVEY

01:29:09.077 --> 01:29:12.480
FOUND THAT 52% OF OBGYN WHO

01:29:12.547 --> 01:29:13.014
WORKING CATHOLIC HOSPITALS

01:29:13.081 --> 01:29:14.015
REPORT CONFLICT WITH THEIR

01:29:14.082 --> 01:29:15.183
HOSPITAL'S RELIGIOUS POLICIES

01:29:15.249 --> 01:29:18.553
FOR CARE. HOSPITAL POLICIES IN

01:29:18.619 --> 01:29:19.687
THE PEOPLE WITHIN THEM HAVE

01:29:19.754 --> 01:29:21.622
CHANGED ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO

01:29:21.689 --> 01:29:23.024
IT WAS LIKELY THAT PATIENTS AND

01:29:23.091 --> 01:29:24.192
EMPLOYEES OF CATHOLIC HOSPITALS

01:29:24.258 --> 01:29:25.793
WERE LARGELY CATHOLIC AND

01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:27.328
WANTED CARE DELIVERED ACCORDING

01:29:27.395 --> 01:29:29.263
TO CATHOLIC DOCTRINE. TODAY

01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:30.665
CATHOLIC HOSPITALS EMPLOYEE AND

01:29:30.732 --> 01:29:33.768
SIR SERVED DIVERSE POPULATIONS.

01:29:33.835 --> 01:29:35.136
RESEARCH SHOWSTHAT PATIENTS

01:29:35.203 --> 01:29:36.871
CATHOLIC OR NOT REALLY CHOOSE A

01:29:36.938 --> 01:29:37.872
HOSPITAL BASED UPON ITS

01:29:37.939 --> 01:29:39.507
RELIGION AND INSTEAD PRIORITIZE

01:29:39.574 --> 01:29:41.175
FACTORS SUCH AS QUALITY

01:29:41.242 --> 01:29:43.311
INSURANCE GEOGRAPHY. THE

01:29:43.377 --> 01:29:45.246
DIRECTIVE DO NOT REFLECT THE

01:29:45.313 --> 01:29:47.248
NEEDS OF PREFERENCES OF EVEN

01:29:47.315 --> 01:29:48.983
THE CATHOLIC WOMEN WHO DO USE

01:29:49.050 --> 01:29:50.685
THEM NEVER MIND THE REST OF THE

01:29:50.752 --> 01:29:52.787
POPULATION THEY SERVE. EVEN

01:29:52.854 --> 01:29:53.855
THOUGH NEARLY ALL AMERICAN

01:29:53.921 --> 01:29:55.323
WOMEN HAVE USED CONTRACEPTION

01:29:55.389 --> 01:29:58.426
IN THEIR LIFETIME. AND ONLY 8%

01:29:58.493 --> 01:29:59.994
OF CATHOLIC WOMEN FEEL

01:30:00.061 --> 01:30:02.163
CONTRACEPTION IS MORALLY WRONG.

01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:03.064
THE DIRECTIVES MANDATE THE

01:30:03.131 --> 01:30:03.731
CATHOLIC HEALTHCARE

01:30:03.798 --> 01:30:04.999
INSTITUTIONS MAY NOT PROMOTER

01:30:05.066 --> 01:30:06.868
CONDONE CONTRACT CONTRACEPTIVE

01:30:06.934 --> 01:30:09.137
PRACTICES. AND WHILE A THIRD OF

01:30:09.203 --> 01:30:10.605
AMERICAN WOMEN INCLUDING

01:30:10.671 --> 01:30:11.973
CATHOLIC WOMEN RELY ON

01:30:12.039 --> 01:30:13.407
STERILIZATION TO LIMIT THEIR

01:30:13.474 --> 01:30:15.443
FAMILIES SIZE THE DIRECTIVES

01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:18.346
STRICTLY PROHIBITED. I WANT TO

01:30:18.412 --> 01:30:20.414
HIGHLIGHT THIS ETHICAL PROBLEM

01:30:20.481 --> 01:30:21.916
A MUCH SMALLER PROPORTION OF

01:30:21.983 --> 01:30:22.950
AMERICANS ACTUALLY AGREE WITH

01:30:23.017 --> 01:30:24.919
CATHOLIC DIRECTIVES THEN THE

01:30:24.986 --> 01:30:26.120
PROPORTION OF PROVIDERS

01:30:26.187 --> 01:30:28.389
REQUIRED TO ABIDE BY THEM. SO

01:30:28.456 --> 01:30:30.024
FUNDS INCLINED ARGUE WELL

01:30:30.091 --> 01:30:31.526
PATIENTS SHOULD GO ELSEWHERE

01:30:31.592 --> 01:30:32.393
AND PROVIDER SHOULD WORK

01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:34.929
ELSEWHERE THAT'S NOT REALISTIC

01:30:34.996 --> 01:30:36.097
GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE

01:30:36.164 --> 01:30:37.732
CATHOLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS

01:30:37.799 --> 01:30:39.934
HAVE GROWN FAR BEYOND. THEIR

01:30:40.001 --> 01:30:41.736
APPROPRIATE FOOT PRINTS.

01:30:41.803 --> 01:30:43.304
OCCUPYING HEALTHCARE TERRITORY

01:30:43.371 --> 01:30:44.772
THAT COMPREHENSIVE PROVIDERS

01:30:44.839 --> 01:30:48.543
NOW CANNOT. TODAY CLERGY HAVE

01:30:48.609 --> 01:30:49.644
LITTLE TO DO WITH THE DAY TO

01:30:49.710 --> 01:30:51.012
DAY RUNNING OF THE HOSPITAL AND

01:30:51.078 --> 01:30:52.313
MARKETING HAS SOUGHT TO DE

01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:54.715
CABALLOS AS THE IMAGE OF MANY

01:30:54.782 --> 01:30:56.918
OF THE HOSPITALS. THIS CAN MAKE

01:30:56.984 --> 01:30:57.919
IT HARD FOR PATIENTS TO

01:30:57.985 --> 01:30:59.420
ANTICIPATE AND AVOID THE

01:30:59.487 --> 01:31:01.756
RESTRICTIONS. A NATIONAL SURVEY

01:31:01.823 --> 01:31:03.958
SHOWED THAT 37% OF WOMEN WHOSE

01:31:04.025 --> 01:31:07.228
OWN HOSPITAL WAS CATHOLIC I.

01:31:07.295 --> 01:31:09.230
DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT WAS. AND

01:31:09.297 --> 01:31:11.132
AMONG THE WOMEN WHO DO KNOW

01:31:11.199 --> 01:31:13.034
THAT THE HOSPITAL'S CATHOLIC.

01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:14.735
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS

01:31:14.802 --> 01:31:15.269
FOR THE CARE THAT THEY'LL

01:31:15.336 --> 01:31:17.839
RECEIVE. 70% EXPECT

01:31:17.905 --> 01:31:20.541
STERILIZATION TO BE AVAILABLE

01:31:20.608 --> 01:31:21.642
77% EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO GET

01:31:21.709 --> 01:31:24.312
BIRTH CONTROL. 42% THINK YOU

01:31:24.378 --> 01:31:25.079
CAN GET AN ABORTION FOR FETAL

01:31:25.146 --> 01:31:28.516
ANOMALY. BUT THE DIRECTIVES

01:31:28.583 --> 01:31:30.685
PROHIBIT ALL OF THESE THINGS.

01:31:30.751 --> 01:31:31.786
IT IS OFTEN ASSUMED THE

01:31:31.853 --> 01:31:33.020
CATHOLIC HOSPITALS TREAT THE

01:31:33.087 --> 01:31:34.856
POOR MORE THAN OTHER HOSPITALS

01:31:34.922 --> 01:31:36.290
HOWEVER NATIONALLY AND IN

01:31:36.357 --> 01:31:37.825
CALIFORNIA THEY PREFER PROVIDE

01:31:37.892 --> 01:31:39.026
ONLY AN AVERAGE AMOUNT OF

01:31:39.093 --> 01:31:40.962
MEDICAID AND CHARITY CARE. AND

01:31:41.028 --> 01:31:42.563
THEY DO SO USING PUBLIC FUNDS

01:31:42.630 --> 01:31:44.565
AND INSURANCE DOT DOLLARS LIKE

01:31:44.632 --> 01:31:46.167
OTHER HOSPITALS NOT MONEY FROM

01:31:46.234 --> 01:31:48.469
THE CHURCH NONETHELESS IN

01:31:48.536 --> 01:31:49.837
NINETEEN STATES WOMEN OF COLOR

01:31:49.904 --> 01:31:52.006
ARE OVER REPRESENTED AMONG

01:31:52.073 --> 01:31:53.574
CATHOLIC HOSPITAL OBSTETRIC

01:31:53.641 --> 01:31:54.942
PATIENTS MEANING THEY'RE MORE

01:31:55.009 --> 01:31:56.410
LIKELY TO NEED REPRODUCTIVE

01:31:56.477 --> 01:31:58.279
CARE IN A RELIGIOUSLY

01:31:58.346 --> 01:32:00.448
RESTRICTIVE CONTEXT THAN WHITE

01:32:00.514 --> 01:32:02.783
WMEN. IN A RECENT STUDY OF

01:32:02.850 --> 01:32:04.385
MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PLANS IN

01:32:04.452 --> 01:32:05.887
ILLINOIS SHOWED THAT BLACK AND

01:32:05.953 --> 01:32:07.955
LATINO WOMEN WERE MORE LIKELY

01:32:08.022 --> 01:32:08.890
THAN WHITE WOMEN TO BE ENROLLED

01:32:08.956 --> 01:32:10.992
IN PLANS THAT SKEWED HEAVILY

01:32:11.058 --> 01:32:13.127
TOWARD CATHOLIC HOSPITALS

01:32:13.194 --> 01:32:14.896
MEANING THEY HAD LESS ON

01:32:14.962 --> 01:32:17.698
COMPREHENSIVE CARE OPTIONS. ALL

01:32:17.765 --> 01:32:19.267
OF THIS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO

01:32:19.333 --> 01:32:20.835
EXISTING RACIAL DISPARITIES IN

01:32:20.902 --> 01:32:22.270
MATERNAL HEALTH WOMEN OF COLOR

01:32:22.336 --> 01:32:24.305
ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY EXPOSED

01:32:24.372 --> 01:32:26.307
TO FAMILY PLANNING BARRIERS AND

01:32:26.374 --> 01:32:27.508
SUB STANDARD PRACTICES FOR

01:32:27.575 --> 01:32:29.310
OBGYN COMPLICATIONS WHICH I'LL

01:32:29.377 --> 01:32:31.579
EXPLAIN IN MORE DETAIL IN A

01:32:31.646 --> 01:32:34.382
MOMENT. THE BISHOPS DIRECTIVES

01:32:34.448 --> 01:32:35.383
FOR CATHOLIC HEALTH CARE ARE A

01:32:35.449 --> 01:32:37.585
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM. THEY RUN

01:32:37.652 --> 01:32:39.620
COUNTER TO BEST PRACTICES IN

01:32:39.687 --> 01:32:41.055
OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY

01:32:41.122 --> 01:32:41.989
FAMILY PLANNING AND TRANS

01:32:42.056 --> 01:32:44.692
GENDER CARE AND FROM RESULT IN

01:32:44.759 --> 01:32:45.293
DISCRIMINATORY IN SUBSTANDARD

01:32:45.359 --> 01:32:47.428
CARE. WELL RESEARCH HAS

01:32:47.495 --> 01:32:48.829
REPEATEDLY DEMONSTRATED THAT

01:32:48.896 --> 01:32:49.764
EVIDENCE BASED FAMILY PLANNING

01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:51.732
METHODS ARE WIDELY EMBRACED BY

01:32:51.799 --> 01:32:52.767
WOMEN IN CRITICAL TO THEIR

01:32:52.833 --> 01:32:54.268
FAMILY'S HEALTH AND WELL BEING.

01:32:54.335 --> 01:32:55.970
THE DIRECTIVES PROHIBIT HEALTH

01:32:56.037 --> 01:32:57.004
PROFESSIONALS FROM PROVIDING

01:32:57.071 --> 01:32:59.140
THEM AND WOMEN FROM RECEIVING

01:32:59.206 --> 01:33:00.675
THE CARE THEY SHOULD BE GETTING.

01:33:00.741 --> 01:33:02.610
PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS AGREE

01:33:02.677 --> 01:33:03.177
THAT A NEW MOTHERS

01:33:03.244 --> 01:33:05.012
CONTRACEPTIVE NEEDS ARE IDEALLY

01:33:05.079 --> 01:33:06.314
ADDRESSED IN THE HOSPITAL AFTER

01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:08.649
DELIVERY. BEFORE RETURNING HOME

01:33:08.716 --> 01:33:10.451
TO TAKE CARE OF A NEWBORN AND

01:33:10.518 --> 01:33:12.086
OFTEN OTHER CHILDREN AS WELL.

01:33:12.153 --> 01:33:13.654
THIS IS A CRITICAL WINDOW OF

01:33:13.721 --> 01:33:15.423
OPPORTUNITY ESPECIALLY IF SHE

01:33:15.489 --> 01:33:17.825
DESIRES A STERILIZATION. IN ONE

01:33:17.892 --> 01:33:19.160
STUDY HALF OF WOMEN WHO WERE

01:33:19.226 --> 01:33:20.861
DENIED A WANTED STERILIZATION

01:33:20.928 --> 01:33:23.030
EXPERIENCED AN UNINTENDED

01:33:23.097 --> 01:33:25.333
PREGNANCY WITHIN A YEAR. IF A

01:33:25.399 --> 01:33:26.767
NEW MOTHER MUST HAVE A SEPARATE

01:33:26.834 --> 01:33:27.868
STERILIZATION PROCEDURE

01:33:27.935 --> 01:33:30.104
ELSEWHERE LATER SHE HAS THE

01:33:30.171 --> 01:33:32.373
ADDITIONAL RISK OF SURGERY AND

01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:34.709
ANESTHESIA ESPECIALLY SHE WAS

01:33:34.775 --> 01:33:36.777
HAVING A C. SECTION ANYWAY.

01:33:36.844 --> 01:33:38.012
CATHOLIC POSSIBLE OBSTETRICIANS

01:33:38.079 --> 01:33:39.513
I INTERVIEWED FOR MY RESEARCH

01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:41.749
TOLD ME THAT WHILE THEY- MIGHT

01:33:41.816 --> 01:33:43.017
BE ABLE TO DO TO DIRECT SOME

01:33:43.084 --> 01:33:45.086
PATIENTS TO DELIVER ELSEWHERE

01:33:45.152 --> 01:33:46.354
IF THEY WANT ACCESS TO

01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:47.521
STERILIZATION SOMETIMES

01:33:47.588 --> 01:33:48.856
PATIENTS GOING TO LABOR LABOR

01:33:48.923 --> 01:33:50.257
AND JUST SHOW UP TO THE

01:33:50.324 --> 01:33:51.625
CATHOLIC HOSPITAL NEEDING WHAT

01:33:51.692 --> 01:33:53.627
THEY CAN'T PROVIDE. ONE DOCTOR

01:33:53.694 --> 01:33:55.896
SAID EVERY TIME I'M ON CALL AND

01:33:55.963 --> 01:33:56.731
PLAYING RUSSIAN ROULETTE

01:33:56.797 --> 01:33:58.099
BECAUSE I FEEL I CAN'T LOOK

01:33:58.165 --> 01:33:59.400
INTO A PATIENT'S ABDOMEN AND AS

01:33:59.467 --> 01:34:01.135
FAR AS I'M CONCERNED. COMMIT

01:34:01.202 --> 01:34:04.105
MALPRACTICE. I MEAN TO GO. TO

01:34:04.171 --> 01:34:05.840
CLOSE SOMEONE UP AND SAY YOU

01:34:05.906 --> 01:34:07.308
NEED ANOTHER OPERATION IS JUST

01:34:07.375 --> 01:34:10.978
MALPRACTICE. PATIENTS WHO WERE

01:34:11.045 --> 01:34:12.780
DENARD DENIED POSTPARTUM

01:34:12.847 --> 01:34:14.081
STERILIZATION VOICE FRUSTRATION

01:34:14.148 --> 01:34:16.484
AND REGRET. I INTERVIEWED A

01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:18.352
WOMAN WHOSE DOCTOR HAD HAD

01:34:18.419 --> 01:34:20.821
TRIED TO GET AN EXCEPTION TO

01:34:20.888 --> 01:34:21.956
THE STERILIZATION POLICY FOR

01:34:22.023 --> 01:34:23.657
HER BASED UPON A MEDICAL

01:34:23.724 --> 01:34:25.393
CONDITION SHE HAD BUT THE

01:34:25.459 --> 01:34:27.194
CATHOLIC HOSPITALS AT THE COULD

01:34:27.261 --> 01:34:29.196
ETHICS COMMITTEE REFUSED SHE

01:34:29.263 --> 01:34:31.966
SAID. QUOTE IF YOU LOOK AT ME

01:34:32.033 --> 01:34:33.501
FROM A MEDICAL STANDPOINT I'M

01:34:33.567 --> 01:34:35.302
NOT AGOOD PREGNANT PERSON I AM

01:34:35.369 --> 01:34:36.737
AT HIGHER RISK OF DYING BECAUSE

01:34:36.804 --> 01:34:39.006
I'M PREGNANT SO IT'S RIDICULOUS

01:34:39.073 --> 01:34:40.574
TO ME YOU KNOW YOUR DOCTOR

01:34:40.641 --> 01:34:42.176
SAYING YEAH BUT THE HOSPITAL

01:34:42.243 --> 01:34:44.812
BOARD SAYING NO SO SORRY WHO

01:34:44.879 --> 01:34:47.681
ARE YOU TO SAY. UNQUOTE NOT

01:34:47.748 --> 01:34:49.083
BEING ALLOWED CONTRACEPTION AND

01:34:49.150 --> 01:34:50.084
STERILIZATION CAN BE

01:34:50.151 --> 01:34:52.386
EXTRAORDINARILY CONFUSING TO

01:34:52.453 --> 01:34:53.421
PATIENTS WHO ARE HIGHLY

01:34:53.487 --> 01:34:54.688
SENSITIVE TO THE SOCIAL

01:34:54.755 --> 01:34:56.557
DISAPPROVAL OF ABORTION. BUT

01:34:56.624 --> 01:34:58.592
CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THEIR

01:34:58.659 --> 01:34:59.994
HEALTH CARE PROVIDER WOULD

01:35:00.061 --> 01:35:00.461
RESTRICT THE MEANS OF

01:35:00.528 --> 01:35:02.897
PREVENTING AT. FOR EXAMPLE ONE

01:35:02.963 --> 01:35:04.665
PATIENT I INTERVIEWED DELIVERED

01:35:04.732 --> 01:35:07.301
PREMATURE TWINS. AND A CATHOLIC

01:35:07.368 --> 01:35:09.170
HOSPITAL AND WAS UNABLE TO

01:35:09.236 --> 01:35:10.071
RECEIVE THE STERILIZATION SHE

01:35:10.137 --> 01:35:11.906
DESIRED WHERE SHE WAS ALSO

01:35:11.972 --> 01:35:13.474
DENIED CONTRACEPTION AFTER THE

01:35:13.541 --> 01:35:14.975
BIRTH BOTH IN THE HOSPITAL AND

01:35:15.042 --> 01:35:17.511
IN HER PHYSICIANS CLINIC WHICH

01:35:17.578 --> 01:35:18.045
WAS OWNED BY THE CATHOLIC

01:35:18.112 --> 01:35:20.381
HOSPITAL. WHEN ASKED HOW SHE

01:35:20.448 --> 01:35:22.383
FELT ABOUT THIS SHE SAID QUOTE.

01:35:22.450 --> 01:35:23.951
I WAS NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THAT

01:35:24.018 --> 01:35:25.486
I WANTED TO PREVENT GETTING

01:35:25.553 --> 01:35:27.221
PREGNANT AGAIN AND THEY'RE NOT

01:35:27.288 --> 01:35:28.889
PROVIDING ME WITH THE RESOURCES

01:35:28.956 --> 01:35:29.990
LIKE IN THIS CASE BIRTH CONTROL

01:35:30.057 --> 01:35:31.392
I FELT LIKE I WAS PRACTICALLY

01:35:31.459 --> 01:35:33.427
BEING OBLIGATED TO NOT TAKE

01:35:33.494 --> 01:35:36.363
BIRTH CONTROL. AND QUOTE. IN

01:35:36.430 --> 01:35:37.298
SOME CATHOLIC HOSPITALS

01:35:37.364 --> 01:35:41.569
PROVIDERS ACTUALLY DO PROVIDE

01:35:41.635 --> 01:35:42.169
CONTRACEPTION BUT THEY DO SO.

01:35:42.236 --> 01:35:44.171
BY USING A PRETEXT THAT THE

01:35:44.238 --> 01:35:45.673
PATIENT NEEDS BIRTH CONTROL FOR

01:35:45.739 --> 01:35:47.808
A DIFFERENT. NON CONTRACEPTIVE

01:35:47.875 --> 01:35:49.443
REASON. AND GIVE THE

01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:50.945
PRESCRIPTION FOR THAT REASON

01:35:51.011 --> 01:35:52.346
HOWEVER THIS CAN ALSO BE VERY

01:35:52.413 --> 01:35:54.548
CONFUSING FOR PATIENTS- I

01:35:54.615 --> 01:35:56.016
INTERVIEWED ONE WOMAN WHO SAID

01:35:56.083 --> 01:35:58.152
I ULTIMATELY HAD. AN

01:35:58.219 --> 01:35:59.920
UNDERSTANDING PROVIDER WHO WENT

01:35:59.987 --> 01:36:01.589
SO YOUR CRAMPS ARE REALLY BAD

01:36:01.655 --> 01:36:03.023
WINK WINK WINK AT ME AND I

01:36:03.090 --> 01:36:05.392
WENT. NO I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY

01:36:05.459 --> 01:36:06.427
HAD CRAMP IN MY LIFE AND HE

01:36:06.494 --> 01:36:07.795
SAID ARE YOU SURE YOU'VE NEVER

01:36:07.862 --> 01:36:09.296
HAD A CRAMP BECAUSE I'M HEARING

01:36:09.363 --> 01:36:11.198
YOUR CRAMPS ARE REALLY BAD. AND

01:36:11.265 --> 01:36:12.366
HE WAS ULTIMATELY ABLE TO

01:36:12.433 --> 01:36:13.267
PROVIDE ME WITH THE

01:36:13.334 --> 01:36:15.169
PRESCRIPTION FOR THE PILLS. SO

01:36:15.236 --> 01:36:16.971
SHE WAS VERY CONFUSED. I DOCTOR

01:36:17.037 --> 01:36:18.939
I INTERVIEWED- FOUND THIS

01:36:19.006 --> 01:36:20.207
RITUAL TO BE ONE OF THE MOST

01:36:20.274 --> 01:36:21.742
TROUBLING ASPECT OF WORKING

01:36:21.809 --> 01:36:23.511
UNDER KEPT THE BISHOPS POLICIES

01:36:23.577 --> 01:36:24.612
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT DIDN'T

01:36:24.678 --> 01:36:27.381
ALWAYS WORK. SHE SAID QUOTE WE

01:36:27.448 --> 01:36:28.482
HAD PATIENTS THAT WERE VERY

01:36:28.549 --> 01:36:30.818
SICK WHO ARE PREGNANT AND

01:36:30.885 --> 01:36:32.186
REALLY NEEDED NOT TO EVER GET

01:36:32.253 --> 01:36:33.787
PREGNANT AGAIN. WOULD SIMPLY BE

01:36:33.854 --> 01:36:35.589
CLOSED UP RIGHT AFTER C.

01:36:35.656 --> 01:36:36.757
SECTION AND SENT OUT TO HAVE A

01:36:36.824 --> 01:36:38.893
TUBAL LIGATION DONE AT AN

01:36:38.959 --> 01:36:40.761
OUTSIDE INSTITUTION. AND YOU

01:36:40.828 --> 01:36:42.463
KNOW PATIENTS WHO DIDN'T GET

01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:45.232
THE THAT THEY HAVE A MEDICAL

01:36:45.299 --> 01:36:47.334
PROBLEM FOR CONTRACEPTION. THE

01:36:47.401 --> 01:36:49.470
DID ACT GET. WHEN OULD SAY

01:36:49.537 --> 01:36:53.274
WELL YOU'RE- ARE YOU. UNQUOTE

01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:53.908
THIS POSITION NOT TO PRESS IN

01:36:53.974 --> 01:36:55.109
CAP HOSPITALS FOR BECAUSE A THE

01:36:55.176 --> 01:36:57.278
WAY SUCH RESTRICTIONS DENIED

01:36:57.344 --> 01:36:57.778
THESE WOMEN REPRODUCTIVE

01:36:57.845 --> 01:37:00.314
AUTONOMY. WOMEN HAVING

01:37:00.381 --> 01:37:02.349
MISCARRIAGES WHO SEE CARE AT

01:37:02.416 --> 01:37:03.918
CATHOLIC HOSPITALS MAY ALSO

01:37:03.984 --> 01:37:05.653
FACE RESTRICTED CARE. THIS

01:37:05.719 --> 01:37:07.087
ARISES BECAUSE ABORTIONS ARE

01:37:07.154 --> 01:37:08.689
COMPLETELY PROHIBITED BY THE

01:37:08.756 --> 01:37:11.192
DIRECTIVES DOCTORS REPORT THAT

01:37:11.258 --> 01:37:12.793
THEY MUST TEST FOR FETAL HEART

01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:14.728
BEATS EVEN WHEN A MISCARRIAGE

01:37:14.795 --> 01:37:16.864
IS CLEARLY INEVITABLE. IF A

01:37:16.931 --> 01:37:18.332
HEART BEAT IS DETECTED THEN

01:37:18.399 --> 01:37:19.867
THEY MUST WAIT FOR SIGNS OF

01:37:19.934 --> 01:37:22.136
INFECTION BEFORE TREATING. THIS

01:37:22.203 --> 01:37:24.104
IS NOT STANDARD PRACTICE IN A

01:37:24.171 --> 01:37:25.839
NON RELIGIOUS SETTING WERE

01:37:36.150 --> 01:37:37.651
CAUSE DISTRESS FOR BOTH THE

THE FIELD OF HIGH RISK

01:38:48.389 --> 01:38:49.723
OBSTETRICS THE DOCTOR WARNED

01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:50.658
HER LEADERSHIP THAT SHE WOULD

01:38:50.724 --> 01:38:52.059
START TURNING AWAY ALL PATIENT

DIDN'T HAVE CONFIDENCE THE

01:38:56.297 --> 01:38:58.332
HOSPITAL WOULD ALLOW HER TO

01:38:58.399 --> 01:38:58.966
MANAGE THEM PER THE STANDARD OF

01:38:59.033 --> 01:39:02.670
CARE. ANOTHER OBGYN WHO WORKED

APPEARING PREGNANCY BUT THE

01:39:14.648 --> 01:39:16.784
OTHER WAS A MOLAR PREGNANCY. A

01:39:16.850 --> 01:39:18.686
MOLAR PREGNANCY IS ONE THAT

01:39:18.752 --> 01:39:21.255

TISSUE CAN BECOME CANCEROUS.

01:39:23.424 --> 01:39:24.458
THREATENING A WOMAN'S LIFE SO

01:39:24.525 --> 01:39:26.593
THE MEDICAL CONSENSUS IS TO

01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:28.462
EVACUATE THE UTERUS COMPLETELY

01:39:28.529 --> 01:39:30.264

01:39:37.204 --> 01:39:38.906

THE DOCTOR IN THIS CASE. WHICH

01:39:51.552 --> 01:39:53.387
IS SIMILAR TO THE EXPERIENCE OF

01:39:53.454 --> 01:39:53.954

01:43:33.206 --> 01:43:35.008
SECOND LARGEST NONPROFIT HEALTH

01:43:35.075 --> 01:43:36.476
SYSTEM IN THE NATION. AFTER

01:43:36.543 --> 01:43:38.211
ASCENSION HEALTH ANOTHER

01:43:38.278 --> 01:43:40.414
CATHOLIC SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH THE

01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:41.615
MERGER DID NOT INCREASE THE

01:43:41.682 --> 01:43:42.950
NUMBER OF DIGNITY HEALTH

01:43:43.016 --> 01:43:43.817
HOSPITALS IN THE STATE

01:43:43.884 --> 01:43:45.919
CONSOLIDATION PROVIDES IT AND

01:43:45.986 --> 01:43:47.421
OTHER CATHOLIC HEALTHCARE

01:43:47.487 --> 01:43:48.488
SYSTEMS WITH THE STRENGTHENED

01:43:48.555 --> 01:43:49.823
POSITION AND THE HEALTHCARE

01:43:49.890 --> 01:43:53.260
MARKETPLACE. IN SOME AREAS OF

01:43:53.327 --> 01:43:54.761
THE STATE A CATHOLIC HOSPITAL

01:43:54.828 --> 01:43:57.197
IS THE ONLY OPTION. FOR EXAMPLE

01:43:57.264 --> 01:43:59.833
IN REDDING PREACH. PREGNANT

01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:01.768
PATIENTS HAVE NO CHOICE OTHER

01:44:01.835 --> 01:44:03.470
THAN MERCY MEDICAL CENTER A

01:44:03.537 --> 01:44:05.572
DIGNITY HEALTH HOSPITAL FOR

01:44:05.639 --> 01:44:07.374
SEVENTY MILES BUT ACCESSING

01:44:07.441 --> 01:44:09.543
PREGNANCY RELATED CARE AT MERCY

01:44:09.610 --> 01:44:11.244
OR ANOTHER CATHOLIC HOSPITAL

01:44:11.311 --> 01:44:12.713
MEANS SUBJECTING ONESELF TO

01:44:12.779 --> 01:44:14.348
RELIGIOUS RULES THAT OVERRIDE

01:44:14.414 --> 01:44:15.882
PATIENT AUTONOMY AN EVIDENCE

01:44:15.949 --> 01:44:18.285
BASED MEDICINE. THESE RELIGIOUS

01:44:18.352 --> 01:44:20.053
RESTRICTIONS CAN PUT PREGNANT

01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:21.755
PEOPLE'S HEALTH AND EVEN LIVES

01:44:21.822 --> 01:44:23.924
AT RISK AS WE HEARD FROM A

01:44:23.991 --> 01:44:26.660
SHELL AND JOSH'S STORY. AT THE

01:44:26.727 --> 01:44:28.462
ACLU WE'RE LITIGATING THREE

01:44:28.528 --> 01:44:30.931
CASES IN CALIFORNIA AGAINST

01:44:30.998 --> 01:44:31.531
CATHOLIC HOSPITALS FOR DENIAL

01:44:31.598 --> 01:44:33.800
OF CARE. I'M GONNA DISCUSS THEM

01:44:33.867 --> 01:44:35.068
BRIEFLY BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT

01:44:35.135 --> 01:44:36.570
ILLUSTRATE BOTH THE STRENGTH OF

01:44:36.637 --> 01:44:38.572
CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING LAW AND

01:44:38.639 --> 01:44:39.906
THE DANGEROUS RELIGIOUS FREEDOM

01:44:39.973 --> 01:44:41.475
ARGUMENTS BEING MADE BY THE

01:44:41.541 --> 01:44:43.677
CATHOLIC HOSPITALS. PUBLIC

01:44:43.744 --> 01:44:45.178
HOSPITALS LIKE ALL OTHER

01:44:45.245 --> 01:44:47.347
HOSPITALS ARE SUBJECT BOTH TO

01:44:47.414 --> 01:44:48.715
THE STATE'S HOSPITAL LICENSING

01:44:48.782 --> 01:44:50.651
LAWS INTO THE UNRUH ACT

01:44:50.717 --> 01:44:52.452
CALIFORNIA'S ROBUST ANTI

01:44:52.519 --> 01:44:54.488
DISCRIMINATION LAW. BUT IN OUR

01:44:54.554 --> 01:44:56.156
CASES THE CATHOLIC HOSPITALS GO

01:44:56.223 --> 01:44:58.091
SO FAR AS TO ARGUE THAT THEY

01:44:58.158 --> 01:44:59.993
ARE AKIN TO A CHURCH. AND

01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:01.728
THEREFORE SHOULD BE EXEMPTED

01:45:01.795 --> 01:45:03.130
FROM THESE LAWS THAT WERE PUT

01:45:03.196 --> 01:45:04.898
IN PLACE TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA

01:45:04.965 --> 01:45:06.867
PATIENCE. IS PROBABLY

01:45:06.933 --> 01:45:09.002
UNNECESSARY TO DETAIL FOR YOU

01:45:09.069 --> 01:45:11.171
HOW THE CHURCH AN INSTITUTION

01:45:11.238 --> 01:45:12.105
THAT PROVIDES RELIGIOUS

01:45:12.172 --> 01:45:14.741
SERVICES TO AN EMPLOYEES AND

01:45:14.808 --> 01:45:16.777
SERVICE PEOPLE OF ITS OWN FAITH

01:45:16.843 --> 01:45:19.079
IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM

01:45:19.146 --> 01:45:21.982
HOSPITAL TREATING THE MEDICAL

01:45:22.049 --> 01:45:24.785
NEEDS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC. IN

01:45:24.851 --> 01:45:26.053
OUR FIRST CASE TOMORROW VERSES

01:45:26.119 --> 01:45:27.888
DIGNITY HEALTH THE ACLU IN

01:45:27.954 --> 01:45:29.423
COVINGTON AND BURLING ARE SUING

01:45:29.489 --> 01:45:30.590
DIGNITY HEALTH ON BEHALF OF

01:45:30.657 --> 01:45:32.359
REBEKAH TOMORROW AND PHYSICIANS

01:45:32.426 --> 01:45:33.560
FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH.

01:45:33.627 --> 01:45:35.228
RELATING TO THE DENIAL OF POST

01:45:35.295 --> 01:45:37.264
PARTUM TUBAL LIGATION. AS WE

01:45:37.330 --> 01:45:38.532
HEARD FROM PROFESSOR FRIEDMAN

01:45:38.598 --> 01:45:40.534
PROVIDING A TUBAL LIGATION

01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:41.568
DIRECTLY AFTER CHILDBIRTH IS

01:45:41.635 --> 01:45:43.937
THE STANDARD OF CARE. BUT

01:45:44.004 --> 01:45:44.438
CATHOLIC HOSPITALS AVE A

01:45:44.504 --> 01:45:45.839
RELIGIOUS POLICY AGAINST

01:45:45.906 --> 01:45:47.007
PROVIDING CONTRACEPTIVE

01:45:47.074 --> 01:45:48.308
SERVICES AND THEREFORE

01:45:48.375 --> 01:45:50.444
ROUTINELY DENY PATIENTS THIS

01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:52.312
IMPORTANT HEALTH CARE. HOWEVER

01:45:52.379 --> 01:45:53.480
AS WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH THE

01:45:53.547 --> 01:45:55.449
LAWSUIT THE SITUATION IS EVEN

01:45:55.515 --> 01:45:56.817
MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE IN

01:45:56.883 --> 01:45:58.618
FACT MANY CATHOLIC HOSPITALS DO

01:45:58.685 --> 01:46:01.555
PROVIDE SOME TUBAL LIGATION TO

01:46:01.621 --> 01:46:04.357
SOME PATIENTS. HOW THEY DO SO

01:46:04.424 --> 01:46:06.793
IS BOTH DEEPLY TROUBLING AND IN

01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:09.429
VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA LAW. IN

01:46:09.496 --> 01:46:09.963
NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR THE

01:46:10.030 --> 01:46:11.565
LEGISLATURE ACTED TO BAN WHAT

01:46:11.631 --> 01:46:12.933
WAS THEN DISTURBING COMMON

01:46:12.999 --> 01:46:15.335
PRACTICE. HOSPITAL'S DENYING

01:46:15.402 --> 01:46:17.304
ACCESS TO TUBAL LIGATION IS

01:46:17.370 --> 01:46:19.005
BASED ON THEIR ASSESSMENT OF

01:46:19.072 --> 01:46:20.774
WHETHER THE PREGNANT PERSON

01:46:20.841 --> 01:46:22.342
SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO STOP

01:46:22.409 --> 01:46:24.311
HAVING CHILDREN. THIS WAS THE

01:46:24.377 --> 01:46:25.912
FLIP SIDE OF THE EGREGIOUS

01:46:25.979 --> 01:46:27.647
EUGENICS POLICY THAT INFLICTED

01:46:27.714 --> 01:46:29.416
STERILIZATION ON OTHER PEOPLE

01:46:29.483 --> 01:46:31.451
PRIMARILY WOMEN OF COLOR

01:46:31.518 --> 01:46:33.553
AGAINST THEIR WILL. THE TOOL

01:46:33.620 --> 01:46:35.756
HOSPITALS USED KNOWN AS THE ONE

01:46:35.822 --> 01:46:38.425
TWENTY RULE. REQUIRED THE

01:46:38.492 --> 01:46:40.660
PREGNANT PERSONS AGE MULTIPLIED

01:46:40.727 --> 01:46:42.696
BY THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN REACH

01:46:42.763 --> 01:46:44.798
THE NUMBER ONE TWENTY BEFORE

01:46:44.865 --> 01:46:46.333
THEY'RE ENTITLED TO A TUBAL

01:46:46.399 --> 01:46:49.169
LIGATION. THE LAW NOW STATES

01:46:49.236 --> 01:46:50.504
THAT HAVE HOSPITALS PROVIDE ANY

01:46:50.570 --> 01:46:52.005
STERILIZATION OPERATIONS THEY

01:46:52.072 --> 01:46:54.007
MAY NOT USE NON MEDICAL

01:46:54.074 --> 01:46:56.877
CRITERIA TO DETERMINE WHICH

01:46:56.943 --> 01:46:58.879
STERILIZATIONS TO PROVIDE.

01:46:58.945 --> 01:47:00.514
DESPITE THIS CLEAR LAW DIGNITY

01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:01.715
HEALTH HOSPITALS ARE DOING

01:47:01.782 --> 01:47:03.717
EXACTLY WHAT IS PROHIBITED

01:47:03.784 --> 01:47:04.985
STRIPPING PATIENTS OF THEIR

01:47:05.051 --> 01:47:06.486
ECONOMY AND MEDICAL DECISION

01:47:06.553 --> 01:47:08.555
MAKING AND USING AGE NUMBER OF

01:47:08.622 --> 01:47:10.457
BIRTHS AND OTHER NON MEDICAL

01:47:10.524 --> 01:47:12.993
CRITERIA TO DECIDE TO WHICH

01:47:13.059 --> 01:47:14.761
PATIENTS THEY WILL PERMIT A

01:47:14.828 --> 01:47:16.596
TUBAL LIGATION. THE FINAL

01:47:16.663 --> 01:47:19.099
DECISION IS MADE BY A NUN NOT A

01:47:19.166 --> 01:47:21.434
MEDICAL PROVIDER. THE OTHER TWO

01:47:21.501 --> 01:47:22.969
CASES PERTAIN TO DENIALS OF

01:47:23.036 --> 01:47:24.471
GENDER FIRMING HYSTERECTOMIES

01:47:24.538 --> 01:47:26.573
TO TRANSGENDER MAN. EVAN MINTON

01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:27.674
ONE OF OUR CLIENTS IS HERE TO

01:47:27.741 --> 01:47:29.709
TELL HIS POWERFUL STORY SO I

01:47:29.776 --> 01:47:31.511
WILL LEAVE THAT TO HIM. BUT I

01:47:31.578 --> 01:47:32.746
WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT BOTH

01:47:32.813 --> 01:47:34.648
MISTER MINTON AND OLIVER NIGHT

01:47:34.714 --> 01:47:36.983
WHO WAS DENIED CARE AT SAINT

01:47:37.050 --> 01:47:38.785
JOSEPH HOSPITAL IN EUREKA. WERE

01:47:38.852 --> 01:47:40.720
DENIED CARE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY

01:47:40.787 --> 01:47:43.256
ARE TRANSGENDER THE ESSENCE OF

01:47:43.323 --> 01:47:44.724
IDENTITY BASED DISCRIMINATION

01:47:44.791 --> 01:47:46.593
THAT THE UNDER ACT IS INTENDED

01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:48.528
TO PROTECT AGAINST. CATHOLIC

01:47:48.595 --> 01:47:49.696
HOSPITALS INCLUDING THE

01:47:49.763 --> 01:47:51.431
HOSPITALS THAT DENIED CARE TO

01:47:51.498 --> 01:47:52.866
MISTER MINTON AND MISTER KNIGHT

01:47:52.933 --> 01:47:54.267
REGULARLY PROVIDE

01:47:54.334 --> 01:47:56.069
HYSTERECTOMIES TO CISGENDER

01:47:56.136 --> 01:47:58.238
WOMEN AND IN FACT HAD SCHEDULED

01:47:58.305 --> 01:48:00.240
THE PROCEDURES FOR BOTH OF OUR

01:48:00.307 --> 01:48:01.808
CLIENTS IT WAS ONLY WHEN THE

01:48:01.875 --> 01:48:03.043
HOSPITAL'S LEARNED THAT MISTER

01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:04.611
KNIGHT AND MISTER MINTON OR

01:48:04.678 --> 01:48:06.313
TRANS GENDER. THAT THEY DENIED

01:48:06.379 --> 01:48:08.114
THEM CARE. WITH RESPECT TO

01:48:08.181 --> 01:48:09.449
MISTER MINTON DIGNITY HEALTH

01:48:09.516 --> 01:48:11.151
HAS ARGUED THAT THEY DID NOT

01:48:11.218 --> 01:48:12.285
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST HIM

01:48:12.352 --> 01:48:14.287
BECAUSE HE WAS ABLE TO ACCESS

01:48:14.354 --> 01:48:16.790
CARE AND A NON CATHOLIC DIGNITY

01:48:16.857 --> 01:48:17.791
HEALTH FACILITY AT A LATER

01:48:17.858 --> 01:48:20.360
TIME. SIMILARLY PROPONENTS OF

01:48:20.427 --> 01:48:21.728
AFFILIATIONS BY THE UNIVERSITY

01:48:21.795 --> 01:48:22.863
OF CALIFORNIA THAT IMPOSE

01:48:22.929 --> 01:48:24.698
RELIGIOUS RESTRICTIONS ON YOU

01:48:24.764 --> 01:48:26.399
SEE PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS.

01:48:26.466 --> 01:48:28.935
ARGUE THAT IF YOU SEE PROVIDERS

01:48:29.002 --> 01:48:30.804
ARE ABLE TO TRANSFER DENIED

01:48:30.871 --> 01:48:32.839
PATIENTS TO ANOTHER FACILITY

01:48:32.906 --> 01:48:34.674
THERE PROVIDING APPROPRIATE

01:48:34.741 --> 01:48:36.910
CARE TO THAT PATIENT. BUT LET'S

01:48:36.977 --> 01:48:37.844
STEP BACK AND CONSIDER THAT FOR

01:48:37.911 --> 01:48:40.380
A MOMENT. AT THE HOSPITAL DOES

01:48:40.447 --> 01:48:43.283
NOT HAVE THE STAFFING LEVEL OF

01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:44.384
EXPERTISE OR INFRASTRUCTURE TO

01:48:44.451 --> 01:48:45.652
PROVIDE CERTAIN MEDICAL

01:48:45.719 --> 01:48:48.788
SERVICES TO PATIENTS IT IS

01:48:48.855 --> 01:48:49.389
APPROPRIATE THAT FOR THEM TO

01:48:49.456 --> 01:48:50.590
TRANSFER THOSE PATIENTS TO

01:48:50.657 --> 01:48:52.893
ANOTHER FACILITY. I HAVE A

01:48:52.959 --> 01:48:54.761
HOSPITAL TRANSFER PATIENTS

01:48:54.828 --> 01:48:57.564
BASED SOLELY ON THEIR IDENTITY

01:48:57.631 --> 01:48:58.732
THAT IS SOMETHING COMPLETELY

01:48:58.798 --> 01:49:00.700
DIFFERENT. FOR THE PURPOSES OF

01:49:00.767 --> 01:49:02.369
OUR LAW IT IS NO DIFFERENT TO

01:49:02.435 --> 01:49:03.570
DISCRIMINATE BASED ON GENDER

01:49:03.637 --> 01:49:04.971
IDENTITY THAT IT WOULD BE FOR

01:49:05.038 --> 01:49:06.539
HOSPITAL TO REFUSE TO TREAT ME

01:49:06.606 --> 01:49:08.475
BECAUSE I AM A WOMAN. OR AN

01:49:08.541 --> 01:49:11.144
ATHEIST. IN ALL THREE OF THESE

01:49:11.211 --> 01:49:12.512
CASES AS THEY PREVIOUSLY

01:49:12.579 --> 01:49:13.380
MENTIONED THE CATHOLIC

01:49:13.446 --> 01:49:14.581
HOSPITALS ARE ALSO MAKING

01:49:14.648 --> 01:49:16.049
SWEEPING CONSTITUTIONAL

01:49:16.116 --> 01:49:17.450
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ARGUMENTS

01:49:17.517 --> 01:49:18.785
THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO

01:49:18.852 --> 01:49:19.953
REFUSE TO FOLLOW STATE

01:49:20.020 --> 01:49:21.354
LICENSING LAW AND STATE

01:49:21.421 --> 01:49:23.089
NONDISCRIMINATION ON.

01:49:23.156 --> 01:49:24.891
SPECIFICALLY THEY WANT TO BE

01:49:24.958 --> 01:49:26.927
ABLE TO PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH

01:49:26.993 --> 01:49:28.528
PATIENTS THEY PROVIDE THESE

01:49:28.595 --> 01:49:30.163
SERVICES TO. SO LET'S TAKE THAT

01:49:30.230 --> 01:49:31.464
AND FOR A SECOND THESE

01:49:31.531 --> 01:49:33.366
HOSPITALS WANT TO BE ABLE TO

01:49:33.433 --> 01:49:34.801
PROVIDE AND THE NINE MEDICAL

01:49:34.868 --> 01:49:37.504
CARE BASED ON WHETHER THEY DEEM

01:49:37.570 --> 01:49:39.606
AN INDIVIDUAL PATIENT MORALLY

01:49:39.673 --> 01:49:41.841
WORTHY. THUS FAR THE ONLY

01:49:41.908 --> 01:49:43.643
APPELLATE COURT IN CALIFORNIA

01:49:43.710 --> 01:49:44.844
TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE HAS AGREED

01:49:44.911 --> 01:49:47.914
WITH US BUT WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT

01:49:47.981 --> 01:49:48.448
WILL HAPPEN IN THE FEDERAL

01:49:48.515 --> 01:49:51.284
COURTS. FOR TOO LONG CATHOLIC

01:49:51.351 --> 01:49:52.852
HOSPITALS HAVE ACTED WITH

01:49:52.919 --> 01:49:54.788
IMPUNITY AND MANY HAVE LISTEN

01:49:54.854 --> 01:49:55.956
TO THEM WHEN THEY HAVE SAID

01:49:56.022 --> 01:49:57.157
THAT THEY ARE ACTING FOR THE

01:49:57.223 --> 01:49:59.392
GREATER GOOD. BUT THEY'RE

THAT PLACE. I WAS ONE OF THE I

01:51:46.666 --> 01:51:48.802
OF SHAME ABOUT MYSELF NEVER

01:51:48.868 --> 01:51:50.637
WANTING MYSELF TO BE MY HOME.

01:51:50.703 --> 01:51:54.007

REALLY FIND OUT WHY. I'M IN TWO

01:52:04.250 --> 01:52:04.984
THOUSAND ELEVEN I WAS IN A

A- I'M TRANS GENDER. AND I

01:52:27.540 --> 01:52:28.074
EXPERIENCED A BRIEF HONEYMOON

01:52:28.141 --> 01:52:30.110
PERIOD THAT ACT QUICKLY

01:52:30.176 --> 01:52:31.177
DEVOLVED INTO WHAT I

01:52:31.244 --> 01:52:34.781
INSTINCTIVELY REFERRED TO AS-

01:52:34.848 --> 01:52:36.883
THE DARK NIGHTS OF MY SOUL. I

01:52:36.950 --> 01:52:37.817
THOUGHT THAT I COULD NEVER

01:52:37.884 --> 01:52:39.452
ACCOMPLISH MY HOPES AND DREAMS

01:52:39.519 --> 01:52:42.789
BECAUSE OF WHO I AM. AND ONE OF

01:52:42.856 --> 01:52:43.356
MY HOPES WAS TO WORK IN THE

01:52:43.423 --> 01:52:46.126
CAPITAL AGAIN. I'D ENTERED THE

01:52:46.192 --> 01:52:46.659
BUILDING AS A WOMAN NAMED

01:52:46.726 --> 01:52:48.928
HEATHER. AND THEN LEFT THE

01:52:48.995 --> 01:52:49.662
BUILDING TO BE A LEGISLATIVE

01:52:49.729 --> 01:52:52.532
ADVOCATE. IN MY THOUGHTS. AND

01:52:52.599 --> 01:52:53.766
MY DREAMS OF RETURNING TO THE

01:52:53.833 --> 01:52:55.435
CAPITAL TO MAKE WIDESPREAD

01:52:55.502 --> 01:52:57.504
POSITIVE CHANGE THROUGH THE LAW

01:52:57.570 --> 01:52:58.872
WE'RE NO LONGER I THOUGHT THAT

01:52:58.938 --> 01:53:00.573
THEY WERE NO LONGER OPEN TO ME.

01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:02.175
AND I CAN'T DESCRIBE HOW MUCH

01:53:02.242 --> 01:53:05.078
THAT HURT. FAST FORWARD TO

01:53:05.145 --> 01:53:06.513
TODAY AND I'M PROUD TO BE

01:53:06.579 --> 01:53:07.547
CONSIDERED THE FIRST OPENLY

01:53:07.614 --> 01:53:08.948
TRANSPORTATION TO HAVE EVER

01:53:09.015 --> 01:53:12.152
WORKED AT THE CAPITOL. THAT

01:53:12.218 --> 01:53:13.520
WHEN I WAS FINALLY READY WHEN I

01:53:13.586 --> 01:53:15.021
WAS FINALLY READY TO PUBLICLY

01:53:15.088 --> 01:53:18.191
ANNOUNCE THIS IS WHO I AM I

01:53:18.258 --> 01:53:19.526
MADE THE DECISION TO BE PUBLIC

01:53:19.592 --> 01:53:21.828
ON FACEBOOK. I KNEW THAT THERE

01:53:21.895 --> 01:53:23.596
WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE STEPS IN MY

01:53:23.663 --> 01:53:25.632
TRANSITION THAT WOULD BE NO

01:53:25.698 --> 01:53:27.901
NOTICEABLE TO PEOPLE AT YOU

01:53:27.967 --> 01:53:29.435
KNOW WARY NOW CLOTHING

01:53:29.502 --> 01:53:30.737
EVENTUALLY CHANGING TO MALE

01:53:30.803 --> 01:53:33.540
PRONOUNS FACIAL HAIR I'M STILL

01:53:33.606 --> 01:53:36.276
WAITING FOR THE FACIAL HAIR.

01:53:36.342 --> 01:53:37.810
AND AT THE TIME I FIGURED THAT

01:53:37.877 --> 01:53:39.546
I COUD EITHER WALK IN MY STORY

01:53:39.612 --> 01:53:41.147
AND OWN IT OR COULD LOSE

01:53:41.214 --> 01:53:42.682
CONTROL OF MY NARRATIVE AND

01:53:42.749 --> 01:53:44.484
SIMPLY SUBJECT MYSELF TO OTHERS

01:53:44.551 --> 01:53:46.152
TALKING ABOUT AND SPECULATING

01:53:46.219 --> 01:53:48.321
ABOUT ME BEHIND MY BACK. AND I

01:53:48.388 --> 01:53:50.723
CHOSE TO DO MORE OF THE FORMER

01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:52.592
IN AN ATTEMPT TO AVOID. THE

01:53:52.659 --> 01:53:56.062
LATER. BUT THAT SHARING EVOLVED

01:53:56.129 --> 01:53:59.365
INTO SO MUCH MORE. IT EVOLVED

01:53:59.432 --> 01:53:59.866
INTO A HUGE COMMUNITY OF

01:53:59.933 --> 01:54:02.835
SUPPORT. AND WHILE A FACED

01:54:02.902 --> 01:54:05.371
EGREGIOUS BALLOTS OF BULLYING

01:54:05.438 --> 01:54:06.940
WITHIN THESE WALLS INCLUDING

01:54:07.006 --> 01:54:08.675
FROM A CURRENT REPUBLICAN

01:54:08.741 --> 01:54:10.343
SENATOR WHO CORNERED ME IN A

01:54:10.410 --> 01:54:12.545
RESTROOM. DEMANDING TO KNOW IF

01:54:12.612 --> 01:54:14.681
I WAS A MAN OR A WOMAN THE LOVE

01:54:14.747 --> 01:54:16.416
I RECIEVE HERE WAS MORE THAN I

01:54:16.482 --> 01:54:18.251
COULD EVER IMAGINE. AND IT HAS

01:54:18.318 --> 01:54:20.587
BEEN TRULY HUMBLING AND ON FIRE

01:54:20.653 --> 01:54:24.490
IN. I KNOW I NEVER GUESSED THAT

01:54:24.557 --> 01:54:26.226
THIS WOULD BE MY LIFE TODAY.

01:54:26.292 --> 01:54:28.027
BUT NOT THERE WAS THE SUPPORT

01:54:28.094 --> 01:54:30.129
MORE OBVIOUS AND NEEDED. THEN

01:54:30.196 --> 01:54:31.297
WHEN I WAS DENIED MEDICALLY

01:54:31.364 --> 01:54:33.233
NECESSARY IN TIME SENSITIVE

01:54:33.299 --> 01:54:37.604
HEALTH CARE BECAUSE OF WHO I AM.

01:54:37.670 --> 01:54:38.137
IN AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND

01:54:38.204 --> 01:54:38.805
SIXTEEN I WAS IN THE PROCESS OF

01:54:38.871 --> 01:54:40.540
UNDERGOING A SERIES OF MEDICAL

01:54:40.607 --> 01:54:42.976
TREATMENTS STEMMING FROM MY

01:54:43.042 --> 01:54:45.345
DIAGNOSIS OF GENDER DYSPHORIA.

01:54:45.411 --> 01:54:46.879
AFTER MY DOCTORS DETERMINED

01:54:46.946 --> 01:54:47.981
THAT A HYSTERECTOMY WAS

01:54:48.047 --> 01:54:49.849
MEDICALLY NECESSARY I WAS

01:54:49.916 --> 01:54:51.150
SCHEDULED TO UNDERGO THE

01:54:51.217 --> 01:54:52.852
SURGERY AT MERCY SAN JUAN

01:54:52.919 --> 01:54:56.289
MEDICAL CENTER. AT THE HOSPITAL

01:54:56.356 --> 01:54:56.856
IN THE DIGNITY HEALTH CHAIN.

01:54:56.923 --> 01:54:58.358
ANDI DID NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT

01:54:58.424 --> 01:54:59.392
WHERE HE SAN JUAN MEDICAL

01:54:59.459 --> 01:55:01.828
CENTER OR DIGNITY HEALTH BUT I

01:55:01.894 --> 01:55:03.563
KNEW THAT MY SURGEON REGULARLY

01:55:03.630 --> 01:55:05.198
PERFORM HYSTERECTOMIES AT THAT

01:55:05.265 --> 01:55:07.634
HOSPITAL. TWO DAYS BEFORE MY

01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:09.836
SURGERY DATE I NURSE CALLED ME

01:55:09.902 --> 01:55:12.005
TO GO OVER THE DETAILS AND I

01:55:12.071 --> 01:55:12.438
MENTIONED THAT I WAS

01:55:12.505 --> 01:55:15.642
TRANSGENDER. THE VERY NEXT DAY

01:55:15.708 --> 01:55:17.577
A DAY BEFORE MY SURGERY BUT

01:55:17.644 --> 01:55:19.646
SUPPOSED TO TAKE PLACE. THE

01:55:19.712 --> 01:55:21.681
HOSPITAL CALLED MY SURGEON TO

01:55:21.748 --> 01:55:23.650
INFORM HER THAT MY SURGERY HAD

01:55:23.716 --> 01:55:26.753
BEEN CANCELED. THE REASON

01:55:26.819 --> 01:55:27.954
BECAUSE IT WAS PART OF MY

01:55:28.021 --> 01:55:30.690
GENDER TRANSITION. I REMEMBER

01:55:30.757 --> 01:55:32.492
WHERE I WAS WHEN MY DOCTOR

01:55:32.558 --> 01:55:34.460
DELIVERED THE NEWS TO ME. SHE

01:55:34.527 --> 01:55:36.696
CALLED ME AND CALMLY BUT

01:55:36.763 --> 01:55:38.031
SORROWFULLY BUT ALSO WITH A

01:55:38.097 --> 01:55:40.233
SENSE OF OUTRAGE TOLD ME THAT

01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:41.367
WHILE SHE HAD ANOTHER

01:55:41.434 --> 01:55:42.468
HYSTERECTOMY ON THE BOOKS

01:55:42.535 --> 01:55:44.804
DIRECTLY AFTER MINE THAT THE

01:55:44.871 --> 01:55:46.839
HOSPITAL WAS NOT CANCELING. THE

01:55:46.906 --> 01:55:48.274
HOSPITAL IS CANCELING MY

01:55:48.341 --> 01:55:50.443
HYSTERECTOMY BECAUSE I AM TRANS

01:55:50.510 --> 01:55:53.146
GENDER. I WAS IN MY PARENTS

01:55:53.212 --> 01:55:54.881
HOUSE IN THEIR BEDROOM IN AT

01:55:54.947 --> 01:55:57.183
THAT MOMENT I WAS SO DEVASTATED

01:55:57.250 --> 01:55:58.117
THAT I JUST LAPPED TO THE

01:55:58.184 --> 01:56:00.153
GROUND. BECAUSE I HAD STRUGGLED

01:56:00.219 --> 01:56:04.090
MY WHOLE LIFE BASED ON WHO I AM

01:56:04.157 --> 01:56:05.992
AND I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO COME

01:56:06.059 --> 01:56:07.960
TO TERMS WITH WHO I AM AND

01:56:08.027 --> 01:56:10.830
ACCEPT WHO I AM AND I FELT SO

01:56:10.897 --> 01:56:13.066
HELPLESS. AND DISTRAUGHT

01:56:13.132 --> 01:56:15.101
BECAUSE THIS HOSPITAL WAS

01:56:15.168 --> 01:56:18.071
DENIED ME CARE BASED EXACTLY ON

01:56:18.137 --> 01:56:21.240
THOSE GROUNDS. HEY ANY A MANY

01:56:21.307 --> 01:56:22.875
MANY FOLKS IN THIS CAPITAL

01:56:22.942 --> 01:56:25.511
COMMUNITY HAVE TROUT TRAVELED

01:56:25.578 --> 01:56:26.112
THAT PORTION OF THE ROAD WITH

01:56:26.179 --> 01:56:31.517
ME. AFTER THOSE WHO DID AND-

01:56:31.584 --> 01:56:33.152
NOT ONLY DID THIS CAN'T AT THIS

01:56:33.219 --> 01:56:35.221
HOSPITAL CANCEL MY SURGERY BUT

01:56:35.288 --> 01:56:36.989
TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE THE FACT

01:56:37.056 --> 01:56:38.424
THAT THE SURGERIES CANCELED

01:56:38.491 --> 01:56:42.161
THEN PUT ALL OF MY OTHER

01:56:42.228 --> 01:56:42.795
TREATMENTS THAT I HAD SCHEDULED

01:56:42.862 --> 01:56:43.296
IN FOR. BECAUSE THEY ARE

01:56:43.363 --> 01:56:44.430
EXPERIENCED DELAYS IN GETTING

01:56:44.497 --> 01:56:46.466
CARE THAT I NEEDED THE TIMING

01:56:46.532 --> 01:56:47.834
OF MY HYSTERECTOMY WAS

01:56:47.900 --> 01:56:50.036
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. IF I

01:56:50.103 --> 01:56:51.437
COULDN'T FOLLOW THIS TIGHTLY

01:56:51.504 --> 01:56:53.206
SCHEDULED COURSE OF TREATMENT

01:56:53.272 --> 01:56:54.474
MY GENDER DYSPHORIA WOULD GET

01:56:54.540 --> 01:56:56.976
PROGRESSIVELY WORSE. FOR ME

01:56:57.043 --> 01:56:59.645
WHAT THAT MEANS IS A FEELING

01:56:59.712 --> 01:57:00.613
THEY HAVE MORE AND MORE IN

01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:02.315
SOCIETY A FEELING OF WANTING TO

01:57:02.382 --> 01:57:07.153
CRAWL OUT OF MY SKIN. IT IT'S

01:57:07.220 --> 01:57:07.687
MY HEALTH AND IT'S MY WELL

01:57:07.754 --> 01:57:11.424
BEING. I WAS FORTUNATE THAT-

01:57:11.491 --> 01:57:12.625
BECAUSE OF MY CONNECTIONS TO

01:57:12.692 --> 01:57:14.560
PEOPLE IN POWER AND BECAUSE OF

01:57:14.627 --> 01:57:16.996
MY OWN WILLINGNESS TO BE VOCAL

01:57:17.063 --> 01:57:19.298
I WAS ABLE TO FIGHT. AND GET MY

01:57:19.365 --> 01:57:20.900
HYSTERECTOMY PERFORMED AT A

01:57:20.967 --> 01:57:23.970
DIFFERENT HOSPITAL. BUT THE

01:57:24.036 --> 01:57:24.504
EXPERIENCE OBVIOUSLY LEAVE

01:57:24.570 --> 01:57:28.307
SCARS. I HAD NO IDEA PRIOR TO

01:57:28.374 --> 01:57:29.675
SEEKING A HYSTERECTOMY THAT MY

01:57:29.742 --> 01:57:31.677
LOCAL COMMUNITY HOSPITAL

01:57:31.744 --> 01:57:32.979
COVERED BY MY INSURANCE WAS A

01:57:33.045 --> 01:57:35.214
CATHOLIC HOSPITAL OR THAT THEY

01:57:35.281 --> 01:57:36.349
WOULD ARGUE THAT RELIGIOUS

01:57:36.416 --> 01:57:38.551
DOCTRINE PERMITS THEM TO DENY

01:57:38.618 --> 01:57:40.386
MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE JUST

01:57:40.453 --> 01:57:41.954
BECAUSE A PATIENT HAPPENS TO BE

01:57:42.021 --> 01:57:45.024
TRANS GENDER. I NOW KNOW THAT

01:57:45.091 --> 01:57:46.392
THE US CONFERENCE OF CATHOLIC

01:57:46.459 --> 01:57:48.261
BISHOPS WHICH DETERMINES

01:57:48.327 --> 01:57:50.696
MEDICAL POLICY. FOR MOST

01:57:50.763 --> 01:57:52.698
DIGNITY HEALTH HOSPITALS

01:57:52.765 --> 01:57:54.634
BELIEVE THE TRANSGENDER PEOPLE.

01:57:54.700 --> 01:57:59.439
DO NOT EVEN EXIST. THINK ABOUT

01:57:59.505 --> 01:58:01.441
THAT BISHOPS DETERMINING

01:58:01.507 --> 01:58:04.377
MEDICAL POLICY OUR TAX FUNDED

01:58:04.444 --> 01:58:06.512
HOSPITALS THAT DISCRIMINATE

01:58:06.579 --> 01:58:10.249
AGAINST TAXPAYERS. SINCE THOSE

01:58:10.316 --> 01:58:11.818
TWO PHONE CALLS THE ONE WITH

01:58:11.884 --> 01:58:13.352
THE DIGNITY HEALTH NURSE AND

01:58:13.419 --> 01:58:15.888
THE ONE WITH MY OWN DOCTOR MY

01:58:15.955 --> 01:58:16.456
ADVOCACY HAS LED ME IN A NEW

01:58:16.522 --> 01:58:18.658
DIRECTION. AND I WANT TO SHARE

01:58:18.724 --> 01:58:20.159
A SAD STATISTIC RIGHT NOW NOT

01:58:20.226 --> 01:58:21.394
THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN SAD ENOUGH

01:58:21.461 --> 01:58:24.330
ALREADY. BUT AS OPPOSED TO ONE

01:58:24.397 --> 01:58:25.832
POINT 6% IN THE GENERAL

01:58:25.898 --> 01:58:28.367
POPULATION. ACCORDING TO THE

01:58:28.434 --> 01:58:30.903
RESEARCH THAT I'VE DONE I AM.

01:58:30.970 --> 01:58:32.104
40% OF THE TRANSGENDER

01:58:32.171 --> 01:58:33.172
COMMUNITY WILL ATTEMPT SUICIDE

01:58:33.239 --> 01:58:37.310
AT LEAST ONCE IN THEIR LIFE 40%

01:58:37.376 --> 01:58:40.146
THIS NUMBER JUMPS TO SIXTY.

01:58:40.213 --> 01:58:42.682
PERCENT OF TRANSGENDER PEOPLE

01:58:42.748 --> 01:58:44.750
WHO HAVE BEEN DENIED MEDICAL

01:58:44.817 --> 01:58:45.384
CARE GETTING ANTI TRANS GENDER

01:58:45.451 --> 01:58:47.553
BIAS. I THAT TO TAKE TO GET

01:58:47.620 --> 01:58:49.021
FROM THE WILLIAMS INSTITUTE OF

01:58:49.088 --> 01:58:52.458
UCLA SCHOOL OF LAW 60% YOU ARE

01:58:52.525 --> 01:58:55.428
MORE LIKELY TO COMMIT SUICIDE

01:58:55.495 --> 01:58:57.230
AFTER EXPERIENCING MEDICAL CARE

01:58:57.296 --> 01:58:58.931
FROM BEING FROM BEING DENIED

01:58:58.998 --> 01:59:01.234
BEING DISCRIMINATED. THEN YOU

01:59:01.300 --> 01:59:01.968
ARE LESS LIKELY TO COMMIT

01:59:02.034 --> 01:59:05.304
SUICIDE THAT'S NUTS IT'S NUTS.

01:59:05.371 --> 01:59:07.707
I'M SO WHILE I CONSIDER MYSELF

01:59:07.773 --> 01:59:09.075
TO BE FULLY ON THE OTHER SIDE

01:59:09.141 --> 01:59:10.810
OF MY TRANSITION I FEEL LIKE I

01:59:10.877 --> 01:59:11.744
WOULD BE SHIRKING MY

01:59:11.811 --> 01:59:13.246
RESPONSIBILITY TO MY COMMUNITY

01:59:13.312 --> 01:59:15.281
IF I DIDN'T CONTINUE THIS

01:59:15.348 --> 01:59:20.219
FIGHT. NO MATTER HOW HARD IT IS.

01:59:20.286 --> 01:59:21.554
I SIMPLY DON'T WANT WHAT

01:59:21.621 --> 01:59:22.221
HAPPENED TO ME TO HAPPEN TO

01:59:22.288 --> 01:59:25.825
ANYBODY ELSE BUT THE TRUTH OF

01:59:25.892 --> 01:59:26.459
THE MATTER IS THAT WE KNOW THAT

01:59:26.526 --> 01:59:28.861
IT DOES. TRANSFERABLE A ROAD

01:59:28.928 --> 01:59:30.630
TEAM ONLY BEING TURNED AWAY BY

01:59:30.696 --> 01:59:32.632
DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS. AND THIS

01:59:32.698 --> 01:59:34.734
IS EVEN MORE DEVASTATING AS MY

01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:36.869
FELLOW PANELISTS HEAD ON. IN

01:59:36.936 --> 01:59:38.704
RURAL AREAS WHERE THERE IS NO

01:59:38.771 --> 01:59:40.940
WHERE ELSE TO TURN. AND IN FACT

01:59:41.007 --> 01:59:42.141
THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES MY

01:59:42.208 --> 01:59:44.277
EXPERIENCE UNIQUE IS THAT A

01:59:44.343 --> 01:59:48.414

TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. AND

02:00:11.671 --> 02:00:12.872

OF WHAT I CALL THIS REFUSAL OF

CARE ROLE. IS TO ENABLE PEOPLE

02:01:08.427 --> 02:01:10.930

REMAINS UNDER WAY I'M INVOLVED

02:01:40.426 --> 02:01:42.695
IN A SECOND FIGHT. TO PREVENT

02:01:42.762 --> 02:01:44.497
RELIGIOUS RESTRICTIONS ON UC

PARTICULARLY PERSONAL TIED TO

02:02:00.513 --> 02:02:04.183
THIS. LAST YEAR I WAS PART OF A

02:02:04.250 --> 02:02:05.051
LARGE COALITION THAT WAS

02:02:05.117 --> 02:02:07.019
SUCCESSFUL IN DEFEATING A

02:02:07.086 --> 02:02:09.221
PROPOSAL TO FORMALIZE IN VASTLY

02:02:09.288 --> 02:02:11.624
EXPANDED PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN

UCSF AND DIGNITY HEALTH. I

02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:15.695
TESTIFIED IN FRONT OF THE UC

02:02:15.761 --> 02:02:18.531
BOARD OF REGENTS AND I'M PROUD

02:02:18.597 --> 02:02:19.098
TO HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN

02:02:19.165 --> 02:02:23.235
THAT VICTORY. IT'S NOT SO WHAT

02:02:23.302 --> 02:02:25.337
WE DISCOVERED IN THE PROCESS.

02:02:25.404 --> 02:02:26.839
INCREASINGLY DISTURBED

02:02:26.906 --> 02:02:28.607
INCREDIBLY DISTURBINGLY HOWEVER

02:02:28.674 --> 02:02:30.643
IN THE COURSE OF THAT FIGHT IT

02:02:30.710 --> 02:02:32.745
WAS UNCOVERED. THAT THE

02:02:32.812 --> 02:02:34.146
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS

02:02:34.213 --> 02:02:36.248
HAD PARTNERSHIPS WITH DIGNITY

02:02:36.315 --> 02:02:38.350
HEALTH HOSPITALS AT EVERY

02:02:38.417 --> 02:02:43.723
SINGLE UC MEDICAL CENTER. AS AS

02:02:43.789 --> 02:02:45.658
AS PROFESSOR I CAME OUT H

02:02:45.725 --> 02:02:47.893
LL SOON TESTIFY THE UC IS NOW

02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:49.462
SEEKING TO INSTITUTIONALIZE

02:02:49.528 --> 02:02:51.297
THIS TYPE OF PARTNERSHIP THREE

02:02:51.363 --> 02:02:53.432
NEW GUIDELINES. THE

02:02:53.499 --> 02:02:54.734
PARTNERSHIPS FORCED THE UC

02:02:54.800 --> 02:02:56.202
DOCTORS AND MEDICAL STUDENTS

02:02:56.268 --> 02:02:57.036
PLACED IN THESE RELIGIOUS

02:02:57.103 --> 02:02:59.638
HOSPITALS TO DENY CARE BASED ON

02:02:59.705 --> 02:03:01.540
RELIGIOUS DOCTRINE. SOUND

02:03:01.607 --> 02:03:04.410
FAMILIAR WHICH ALSO IMPACTS ALL

02:03:04.477 --> 02:03:05.878
SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES THAT

02:03:05.945 --> 02:03:09.348
NEED THAT CARE. ESSENTIALLY THE

02:03:09.415 --> 02:03:11.250
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS

02:03:11.317 --> 02:03:14.186
SANCTIONING AND PARTICIPATING

02:03:14.253 --> 02:03:16.722
IN THE SAME HARMFUL POLICY THAT

02:03:16.789 --> 02:03:18.624
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS

02:03:18.691 --> 02:03:21.694
PROPOSING IN THEIR HARMFUL

02:03:21.761 --> 02:03:24.029
REFUSAL OF CARE ROLE.

02:03:24.096 --> 02:03:25.564
IRONICALLY THE TRUMP

02:03:25.631 --> 02:03:27.433
ADMINISTRATION CAN'T EVEN

02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:29.101
IMPLEMENT THEIR ROLE YET

02:03:29.168 --> 02:03:31.137
BECAUSE THANKFULLY IT'S BEING

02:03:31.203 --> 02:03:33.539
HELD UP IN THE COURTS. IT'S

02:03:33.606 --> 02:03:36.175
UNTHINKABLE WHAT THE UC IS

02:03:36.242 --> 02:03:38.878
DOING RIGHT NOW IN AN EFFORT TO

02:03:38.944 --> 02:03:42.381
INCREASE THEIR MARKET SHARE. I

02:03:42.448 --> 02:03:45.050
FIND IT EVEN MORE TROUBLING.

02:03:45.117 --> 02:03:45.684
THAT THE UC IS SAYING THAT THEY

02:03:45.751 --> 02:03:47.653
NEED TO DO A- IN ORDER TO

02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:49.255
INCREASE ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE

02:03:49.321 --> 02:03:51.791
FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES.

02:03:51.857 --> 02:03:53.959
BECAUSE YES. UNDERSERVED

02:03:54.026 --> 02:03:57.096
COMMUNITIES ABSOLUTELY NEED

02:03:57.163 --> 02:03:59.865
ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. BUT WHAT

02:03:59.932 --> 02:04:00.966
THESE COMMUNITIES NEED AND

02:04:01.033 --> 02:04:02.568
DESERVE LIKE EVERY SINGLE OHER

02:04:02.635 --> 02:04:05.805
COMMUNITY IS ACCESS TO

02:04:05.871 --> 02:04:06.372
COMPREHENSIVE SCIENCE BASED

02:04:06.438 --> 02:04:09.041
HEALTHCARE. IT'S NOT HOSPITALS

02:04:09.108 --> 02:04:11.143
THAT WILL LIMIT CARE AND THEN

02:04:11.210 --> 02:04:11.744
BETRAYED THEM IN THEIR TIME OF

02:04:11.811 --> 02:04:15.347
NEED. ARE YOU SEE BOTH A BOARD

02:04:15.414 --> 02:04:17.183

02:04:17.249 --> 02:04:20.853
IS FORTHCOMING. THE AND THAT'S

02:04:20.920 --> 02:04:22.855
WHY I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR THIS

02:04:22.922 --> 02:04:24.824
OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY

02:04:24.890 --> 02:04:29.428

OPTIONS ARE NOW SHAPING THE

02:11:24.009 --> 02:11:26.878
DISCRIMINATION- BOTH GUIDELINES

02:11:26.945 --> 02:11:28.213
WOULD REQUIRE AFFILIATES TO

02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:30.015
HAVE AN EXPRESS INSTITUTIONAL

02:11:30.082 --> 02:11:30.916
POLICY PROHIBITING

02:11:30.983 --> 02:11:32.718
DISCRIMINATION. ON ALL GROUNDS

SEE VALUES. HOWEVER OPTION TO

02:11:36.955 --> 02:11:38.156
AN OPTION TO WAS THE ONE THAT

02:11:38.223 --> 02:11:39.558
WILL EFFECTIVELY PRECLUDE

02:11:39.625 --> 02:11:41.159
AFFILIATIONS BETWEEN YOU SEE IN

02:11:41.226 --> 02:11:42.261

HAVE RELIGIOUS RESTRICTIONS ON

02:11:45.664 --> 02:11:47.966
HEALTH CARE OPTION TWO IS

02:11:48.033 --> 02:11:49.434
GUIDELINE WOULD ALSO REQUIRE

02:11:49.501 --> 02:11:51.203
THAT AFFILIATION AGREEMENTS.

02:11:51.270 --> 02:11:53.071
STATE THAT YOU SEE CONSIDERS

SEE ANTI DISCRIMINATION POLICY.

02:12:08.253 --> 02:12:09.921
THE SECOND PRINCIPLE I'M GONNA

02:12:09.988 --> 02:12:10.689
MENTION A GUIDELINE THAT I'M

02:12:10.756 --> 02:12:12.457
GONNA MENTION ADDRESSES

02:12:12.524 --> 02:12:16.328
EXPANDING ACCESS TO CARE. SO

02:12:16.395 --> 02:12:18.597
BOTH OPTIONS A FIRM THE GOAL OF

02:12:18.664 --> 02:12:20.799
REDUCING BARRIERS TO ACCESS-

02:12:20.866 --> 02:12:22.601
TWO CARAT YOU SEE HEALTH.

02:12:22.668 --> 02:12:25.237
OPTION ONES GUIDELINES STATES

02:12:25.304 --> 02:12:27.272
YOU SEE WILL EVALUATE POTENTIAL

02:12:27.339 --> 02:12:29.207
AFFILIATIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF

02:12:29.274 --> 02:12:30.842
UC'S COMMITMENT TO OPTIMIZE

02:12:30.909 --> 02:12:33.045
ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE NON

02:12:33.111 --> 02:12:34.646
DISCRIMINATORY EVIDENCE BASED

02:12:34.713 --> 02:12:36.982
HEALTH CARE OPTIONS. TO IMPROVE

02:12:37.049 --> 02:12:38.917
HEALTH FOR ALL PEOPLE WHO LIVE

02:12:38.984 --> 02:12:40.152
IN CALIFORNIA YOU SEE HEALTH

02:12:40.218 --> 02:12:42.454
WILL CONSIDER ALL ASPECTS OF AN

02:12:42.521 --> 02:12:44.589
ORCHID ORGANIZATIONS CARE IN AN

02:12:44.656 --> 02:12:46.925

POLICY BASE RESTRICTIONS TO.

02:12:48.527 --> 02:12:50.529
SERVICE TO THE UNDERSERVED AND

02:12:50.595 --> 02:12:51.363
THREE THE AVAILABILITY OF OTHER

02:12:51.430 --> 02:12:53.131
FACILITIES WITHIN A GEOGRAPHIC

02:12:53.198 --> 02:12:55.467
REGION. ADVOCATES FOR THE

02:12:55.534 --> 02:12:57.336
AFFILIATIONS HAVE FOCUSED ON

02:12:57.402 --> 02:12:59.204
SERVICES TO THE UNDERSERVED AND

02:12:59.271 --> 02:13:00.939
YET AS LAURA FRIEDMAN MENTION

02:13:01.006 --> 02:13:02.240
NATIONAL DATA SHOW THAT WHILE

02:13:02.307 --> 02:13:03.709
CATHOLIC SERVICES ARE MEDICAID

02:13:03.775 --> 02:13:06.845
HOSPITALS. THEY DO NOT PROVIDE-

02:13:06.912 --> 02:13:07.746
HIGHER LEVELS OF CHARITY CARE

02:13:07.813 --> 02:13:09.681
THAN PUBLIC HOSPITALS IN EVEN

02:13:09.748 --> 02:13:12.250
SOME FOR PROFIT SYSTEMS. OPTION

02:13:12.317 --> 02:13:14.186
TWO SKYLINE ON EXPANDING ACCESS

02:13:14.252 --> 02:13:17.422
TO CARE STATES THAT YOU SEE.

02:13:17.489 --> 02:13:18.023
WILL EVALUATE POTENTIAL

02:13:18.090 --> 02:13:20.826
pAFFILIATIONS AND TAKE NECESSARY

02:13:20.892 --> 02:13:22.361
ACTION TO PROMOTE AND NOT

02:13:22.427 --> 02:13:23.528
PROHIBIT OR LIMIT HEALTH CARE

02:13:23.595 --> 02:13:26.531
OPTIONS. TO ENSURE THE ACCESS

02:13:26.598 --> 02:13:28.600
TO SERVICES INCLUDING ABORTION

02:13:28.667 --> 02:13:29.735
CONTRACEPTION ASSISTED

02:13:29.801 --> 02:13:31.803
REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND

02:13:31.870 --> 02:13:32.771
GENDER FROM CARE FOR

02:13:32.838 --> 02:13:34.206
TRANSGENDER PEOPLE ARE

02:13:34.272 --> 02:13:35.607
MAINTAINED OR IMPROVED AS A

02:13:35.674 --> 02:13:37.843
RESULT OF THE AFFILIATION. YOU

02:13:37.909 --> 02:13:38.844
SEE WILL ENSURE THAT

02:13:38.910 --> 02:13:40.479
AFFILIATIONS DO NOT RESULT IN A

02:13:40.545 --> 02:13:42.547
DECREASE IN THE ABILITY OF YOU

02:13:42.614 --> 02:13:43.915
SEE PATIENTS TO OBTAIN THE

02:13:43.982 --> 02:13:46.051
SERVICES AND FACILITIES WHERE

02:13:46.118 --> 02:13:47.619
THEY RECEIVE CARE COMPARED WITH

02:13:47.686 --> 02:13:49.488
ACCESS TO THE SERVICES PRIOR TO

02:13:49.554 --> 02:13:51.990
THE AFFILIATION. SO THE OPTION

02:13:52.057 --> 02:13:53.492
TO GUIDELINES ARE MORE SPECIFIC

02:13:53.558 --> 02:13:55.427
ABOUT THE SERVICES THAT ISSUE.

02:13:55.494 --> 02:13:56.595
AND THEY PROVIDE A STANDARD

02:13:56.661 --> 02:13:58.163
AGAINST WHICH TO MEASURE IMPACT

02:13:58.230 --> 02:13:59.931
OF AFFILIATIONS. AND THEY

02:13:59.998 --> 02:14:01.900
MANDATE ACTION AS OPPOSED TO

02:14:01.967 --> 02:14:04.302
OPTION ONES REQUIREMENT THE

02:14:04.369 --> 02:14:06.605
FACTOR SIMPLY BEACON CENTERED.

02:14:06.671 --> 02:14:07.539
SO I WANT TO SPEND JUST A

02:14:07.606 --> 02:14:08.740
MINUTE OR TO TALK ABOUT THE

02:14:08.807 --> 02:14:10.409
IMPORTANCE OF ACCESS TO QUALITY

02:14:10.475 --> 02:14:11.143
OF CARE BY UNDERSERVED

02:14:11.209 --> 02:14:13.078
COMMUNITIES. SAID THOSE WHO ARE

02:14:13.145 --> 02:14:14.813
ADVOCATING FOR AFFILIATIONS

02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:16.548
WITH HOSPITALS THAT USE THE

02:14:16.615 --> 02:14:17.015
ETHICAL AND RELIGIOUS

02:14:17.082 --> 02:14:18.750
DIRECTIVES ON HEALTH CARE. HAVE

02:14:18.817 --> 02:14:19.684
BEEN HIGHLIGHTING THE GOAL OF

02:14:19.751 --> 02:14:21.219
EXPANDING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE

02:14:21.286 --> 02:14:23.288
TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. AND

02:14:23.355 --> 02:14:24.156
THEY POSIT THE CATHOLIC

02:14:24.222 --> 02:14:27.092
HOSPITALS AS- THE POSITION A

02:14:27.159 --> 02:14:28.360
CATHOLIC HOSPITALS AS VEHICLES

02:14:28.427 --> 02:14:30.862
TO EXPAND UC'S ABILITIES. TO

02:14:30.929 --> 02:14:31.630
PROVIDE CARE TO UNDERSERVED

02:14:31.696 --> 02:14:34.299
COMMUNITIES AS AN ASIDE IT'S A

02:14:34.366 --> 02:14:35.734
LITTLE IRONIC BECAUSE SOME OF

02:14:35.801 --> 02:14:36.535
THE UC MEDICAL CENTERS

02:14:36.601 --> 02:14:38.203
INCLUDING UC DAVIS MY HOME

02:14:38.270 --> 02:14:40.372

HAVE CONSISTENTLY BEEN ACCEPTED

02:14:45.343 --> 02:14:48.013
MEDICAID PATIENTS. CATHOLIC

02:14:48.079 --> 02:14:49.414
HOSPITALS AS I MENTIONED ARE

02:14:49.481 --> 02:14:51.483
MEDI CAL OR MEDICAID HOSPITALS

02:14:51.550 --> 02:14:52.451
THEY DO PROVIDE CARE FOR LOW

02:14:52.517 --> 02:14:54.219
INCOME PEOPLE. ENROLLED IN

02:14:54.286 --> 02:14:57.222
MEDICAID- JUST A LITTLE BIT OF

02:14:57.289 --> 02:14:58.924
DATA AMONG NON ELDERLY MEDI CAL

02:14:58.990 --> 02:15:01.827

BLACK AN AFRICAN AMERICAN 60%

02:15:04.629 --> 02:15:07.332
ARE LEFT IN ACCESS. AND 10% ARE

02:15:07.399 --> 02:15:09.100
ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER. MANY

02:15:09.167 --> 02:15:10.402
MEMBERS OF THESE COMMUNITIES

02:15:10.469 --> 02:15:12.204
ARE ALSO LESBIAN GAY BISEXUAL

02:15:12.270 --> 02:15:13.538
AND TRANSGENDER THE BARRIERS

02:15:13.605 --> 02:15:16.007
THEY FACE TO NON DISCRIMINATORY

02:15:16.074 --> 02:15:18.643
FULL SERVICE CARE OFTEN GREATER.

02:15:18.710 --> 02:15:20.278
62% A MEDI CAL ENROLLEES IN

02:15:20.345 --> 02:15:22.347
CALIFORNIA- IDENTIFIED AS WOMEN

02:15:22.414 --> 02:15:23.582
AND MANY WOMEN AND ROLLING MEDI

02:15:23.648 --> 02:15:25.484
CAL WHEN THEY BECOME PREGNANT.

02:15:25.550 --> 02:15:26.718
EITHER BECAUSE THEY ARE SEEKING

02:15:26.785 --> 02:15:28.086
PRENATAL SERVICES AND SOMEONE

02:15:28.153 --> 02:15:29.588
ROLE BECAUSE THEY ARE SEEKING

02:15:29.654 --> 02:15:31.690
ACCESS TO ABORTION. NATIONALLY

02:15:31.756 --> 02:15:33.525
PATIENTS WHEN MEDICAID COVERAGE

02:15:33.592 --> 02:15:33.859
ARE LARGELY IN

02:15:33.925 --> 02:15:35.594
DISPROPORTIONATELY WOMEN.

02:15:35.660 --> 02:15:38.163
PARTICULARLY WOMEN OF COLOR-

02:15:38.230 --> 02:15:39.331
PROFESSOR FRIEDMAN MENTION THE

02:15:39.397 --> 02:15:42.734
STUDY A TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN

02:15:42.801 --> 02:15:43.335
STUDY COMPARING FAITH. EXAMINE

02:15:43.401 --> 02:15:44.169
THIRD FOUR STATES AND FOUND

02:15:44.236 --> 02:15:45.704
THAT IN NINETEEN STATES WOMEN

02:15:45.770 --> 02:15:47.472
OF COLOR MORE LIKELY THAN WHITE

02:15:47.539 --> 02:15:47.973
WOMEN TO GIVE BIRTH AT

02:15:48.039 --> 02:15:49.875
HOSPITALS. BOUND BY THE E. R.

02:15:49.941 --> 02:15:52.511
D.'S. SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS

02:15:52.577 --> 02:15:54.012
THAT HOSPITAL'S BOUND BY THE E.

02:15:54.079 --> 02:15:55.881
R. T.'S MIGHT BE PROVIDING CARE

02:15:55.947 --> 02:15:57.516
FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES.

02:15:57.582 --> 02:15:59.017
BUT IN DOING SO THEY PUT HE

02:15:59.084 --> 02:16:00.018
MAJORITY OF THOSE PATIENTS AT

02:16:00.085 --> 02:16:01.953
RISK OF LESS THAN STANDARD CARE

02:16:02.020 --> 02:16:03.288
AND EXCLUSION FROM NECESSARY

02:16:03.355 --> 02:16:05.957
SERVICES. SO THE LOGIC OF THOSE

02:16:06.024 --> 02:16:07.459
WHO ARE SUPPORTING AFFILIATIONS

02:16:07.526 --> 02:16:10.729

DOING OURSELVES OR THAT WE CAN

02:17:38.917 --> 02:17:39.484

WHICH CHEST PIECE MOVES ALWAYS

02:30:14.705 --> 02:30:18.309
THE- I'M SO IN A QUESTION AND-

02:30:18.376 --> 02:30:22.380
THE UC AFFILIATION AT SO. ONE

02:30:22.446 --> 02:30:23.981
OF THINGS WE HEAR IS YOU KNOW

02:30:24.048 --> 02:30:24.782
WELL YOU'RE HAAS YOU SEE

02:30:24.849 --> 02:30:26.817
HOSPITAL AND THEIR CAPACITY IN

02:30:26.884 --> 02:30:28.886
DOWN THE ROAD YOU HAVE A- AM

02:30:28.953 --> 02:30:31.422
CATHOLIC AT A HOSPITAL AND THEN

02:30:31.489 --> 02:30:33.190
YOU KNOW THEY HAVE ANTI BAD IF

02:30:33.257 --> 02:30:33.924
WE CAN MOVE THE PATIENTS WHO

02:30:33.991 --> 02:30:37.261
WON'T BE AFFECTED BY POLICIES.

02:30:37.328 --> 02:30:38.429
SO IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHETHER

02:30:38.496 --> 02:30:41.932
THAT'S- REAL OR NOT. AND THEN.

02:30:41.999 --> 02:30:43.100
YOU KNOW WE WOULD HAVE SPACES

02:30:43.167 --> 02:30:44.568
ARE MORE PEOPLE IN THE UC I

02:30:44.635 --> 02:30:45.836
GUESS MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS

02:30:45.903 --> 02:30:47.471
COULD WE MOVE. TRANSFER THOSE

02:30:47.538 --> 02:30:50.841
PEOPLE WITHOUT AFFILIATION IS

02:30:50.908 --> 02:30:51.409
THAT A REAL ARGUMENTS I MEAN

02:30:51.475 --> 02:30:52.510
I'M JUST TRYING TO PERSPECTIVE.

02:30:52.576 --> 02:30:55.112
IT'S FOR. WITH A YOU. IS A FOLK.

02:30:55.179 --> 02:30:56.380
AND THERE'S A DIGNITY YEAR I

02:30:56.447 --> 02:30:56.981
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SAN

02:30:57.047 --> 02:30:59.016
FRANCISCO- VERSION OF THE SETS

02:30:59.083 --> 02:31:00.418
COULD WE MOVE THOSE PATIENTS TO

02:31:00.484 --> 02:31:01.619
THAT CTHOLIC HOSPITAL WITHOUT

02:31:01.685 --> 02:31:03.687
THE AFFILIATION OR THEY TRACKED

02:31:03.754 --> 02:31:05.222
AND YOU SEE HOSPITAL I GUESS I

02:31:05.289 --> 02:31:06.557
DON'T SEE THE AFFILIATION IS

02:31:06.624 --> 02:31:07.992
NECESSARY TO THE NEED THAT IS

02:31:08.058 --> 02:31:09.794
BEING EXPRESSED TO ME. AND I

02:31:09.860 --> 02:31:12.296
WONDER IF IT IS RARE. I MEAN.

02:31:12.363 --> 02:31:14.265
SO I WOULD REALLY THIS

02:31:14.331 --> 02:31:16.066
RATIONALES FOR THE- OKAY YEAH.

02:31:16.133 --> 02:31:17.568
I MEAN IT SEEMS LIKE EACH

02:31:17.635 --> 02:31:19.537
CAMPUS HAS THEIR OWN CLINICAL.

02:31:19.603 --> 02:31:21.572
CAN OF SCENARIOS THAT COME UP

02:31:21.639 --> 02:31:22.306
AND THEY CAN BE SLIGHTLY

02:31:22.373 --> 02:31:24.475
DIFFERENT BUT- BUT- I THINK YOU

02:31:24.542 --> 02:31:26.210
ASK A- GOOD QUESTION AND ONE OF

02:31:26.277 --> 02:31:28.679
THE THAT. THINGS THAT I KEEP

02:31:28.746 --> 02:31:31.048
WANTING. TO PUSH BACK IS WE

ANSWERS TO A LOT OF QUESTIONS-

02:31:37.154 --> 02:31:39.757
AND SO THIS THIS. I THINK

02:31:39.824 --> 02:31:42.693
BEFORE WE- CONSIDER OPENING THE

02:31:42.760 --> 02:31:45.129
DOOR TO MORE- SORT OF CEMENTING

SYSTEMS AS WELL IN THOSE

02:31:51.635 --> 02:31:53.037
PARTNERSHIPS WE NEED TO LOOK AT

02:31:53.103 --> 02:31:54.238
WHAT THE ALTERNATIVES ARE AND

02:31:54.305 --> 02:31:55.973
WHAT THE REAL IMPACTS ARE SO. A

02:31:56.040 --> 02:31:58.409
LOT OF THIS IS BEEN. M. SERVE

02:31:58.476 --> 02:31:59.910
DISCUSSED IN THE ABSTRACT

02:31:59.977 --> 02:32:02.313
WITHOUT REALLY GOOD DATA ABOUT

02:32:12.556 --> 02:32:13.891
FORTH BUT WHAT THEY WANTED TO

02:32:13.958 --> 02:32:15.659

02:33:07.678 --> 02:33:08.879
QUESTION WAS IF WE HAVE THOSE

02:33:08.946 --> 02:33:10.047
KNEE REPLACEMENTS- CAN BE MOVED

TRANSPLANT NEEDS THAT ONLY CAN

02:33:16.220 --> 02:33:17.154
BE THIRTY SAID CAN WE STILL

02:33:17.221 --> 02:33:18.789
TRANSFER THAT KNEE REPLACEMENT

02:33:18.856 --> 02:33:19.823
I GUESS I'M CONFUSED BY THE

02:33:19.890 --> 02:33:21.091
NEED FOR THE VIOLATION IN ORDER

02:33:21.158 --> 02:33:22.293
TO DO THAT. ALL ALL JUST-

02:33:22.359 --> 02:33:24.161
QUICKLY SAY BEFORE THE EXPERTS

02:33:24.228 --> 02:33:25.863
WAY AND- ON EITHER SIDE OF ME

02:33:25.930 --> 02:33:26.797
BECAUSE I JUST HAVE MY OWN

02:33:26.864 --> 02:33:30.134
STORY TO SHARE. BUT AND I GOT

02:33:30.200 --> 02:33:31.402
LOST IN THE DIGNITY HEALTH

02:33:31.468 --> 02:33:33.170
SYSTEM LIKE PEOPLE ARE GONNA

02:33:33.237 --> 02:33:37.808
GET LOST REGARDLESS I WAS. ON

02:33:37.875 --> 02:33:39.143
THE BOOKS AND THE DIGNITY

02:33:39.209 --> 02:33:41.078
HEALTH SIT. IN AND- GENDER AND

02:33:41.145 --> 02:33:42.046
THEN THEY IMMEDIATELY TOOK ME

02:33:42.112 --> 02:33:43.614
OFF THE BOOKS. AND SO

02:33:43.681 --> 02:33:46.550
REGARDLESS AB AND I REALLY LOOK

02:33:46.617 --> 02:33:47.518
FOR CAN'T WHAT THE EXPERTS ARE

02:33:47.585 --> 02:33:50.087
GONNA SAY. BACK AND REGARDLESS.

02:33:50.154 --> 02:33:51.355
YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO

02:33:51.422 --> 02:33:53.457
GET LOST IN THE SYSTEM AND

02:33:53.524 --> 02:33:54.458
MISTAKES ARE GOING TO BE. EIGHT

02:33:54.525 --> 02:33:56.193
AND ALL THREE OF. US OF THE

02:33:56.260 --> 02:33:58.329
FACT THAT- YOU KNOW THERE'S A

02:33:58.395 --> 02:34:00.397
40% TO. TEN GROUP IN THE TRANS

02:34:00.464 --> 02:34:02.333
COMMUNITY. THAT NUMBER JUMPS

02:34:02.399 --> 02:34:04.835
260% WHEN WERE DENIED. CARE YOU

02:34:04.902 --> 02:34:07.638
KNOW. DUE TO ANTI TRANS BIAS.

02:34:07.705 --> 02:34:09.974
SO I DON'T WANT ANY MISTAKES TO

02:34:10.040 --> 02:34:12.643
BE MADE. AS IT IS A MATTER OF

02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:16.313
LIFE AND DEATH. ONE LORRIES

02:34:16.380 --> 02:34:16.814
MADE THIS POINT REALLY

02:34:16.880 --> 02:34:19.016
EFFECTIVELY BEFORE IS THAT NOT

02:34:19.083 --> 02:34:20.384
EVERYBODY WHO HAS A HEART

02:34:20.451 --> 02:34:24.088
CONDITION RIGHT IS A MAN. RIGHT

02:34:24.154 --> 02:34:24.655
THEY MIGHT BE SOMEBODY FINDS

02:34:24.722 --> 02:34:27.625
OUT THEY'RE PREGNANT- AND THEY

02:34:27.691 --> 02:34:29.026
NEED CARE BECAUSE OF THAT. SO

02:34:29.093 --> 02:34:30.094
THERE'S THAT CONCERN AS WELL

02:34:30.160 --> 02:34:31.996
BUT THE OTHER IS YOU KNOW THE

02:34:32.062 --> 02:34:33.497
STORY THE EVAN MEN RAISES THE

02:34:33.564 --> 02:34:36.200
DIGNITARY CONCERNS SO YEAH YOU

02:34:36.266 --> 02:34:37.067
COULD TRANSFER SOMEBODY WHO

02:34:37.134 --> 02:34:38.402
NEEDS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE

02:34:38.469 --> 02:34:39.370
SOME OTHER SORT OF CARE THAT'S

02:34:39.436 --> 02:34:42.906
PROHIBITED BY THE E. R. DIS. TO

02:34:42.973 --> 02:34:44.108
RIGHT FROM THE FROM THE

02:34:44.174 --> 02:34:45.643
CATHOLIC LITTLE TO THE UC

02:34:45.709 --> 02:34:46.910
HOSPITAL SO THEY CAN RECEIVE

02:34:46.977 --> 02:34:49.980
THAT BUT THE TRANSFER ITSELF

02:34:50.047 --> 02:34:50.781
WAS SIGNATORY HARM. THE FACT

02:34:50.848 --> 02:34:52.049
THAT IT'S SYSTEMATIC THE

02:34:52.116 --> 02:34:53.017
IMPACTS ONLY CERTAIN

02:34:53.083 --> 02:34:54.051
POPULATIONS IN THAT THAT'S

02:34:54.118 --> 02:34:58.088
PREDICTABLE. IS PART OF WHOLE

02:34:58.155 --> 02:34:59.156
THAT SIX PLACE AT WHY WE KEEP

02:34:59.223 --> 02:35:00.991
USING THE WORD DISCRIMINATION

02:35:01.058 --> 02:35:02.159
RIGHT AND THAT'S WHY IT

02:35:02.226 --> 02:35:03.761
VIOLATES BOTH THE VALUES OF YOU

02:35:03.827 --> 02:35:05.629
SEE. ON THE STATE OF VALUES OF

02:35:05.696 --> 02:35:07.231
YOU SEE AND THE VALUES OF THE

02:35:07.297 --> 02:35:08.666
STATE SO YES IT'S TRUE YOU CAN

02:35:08.732 --> 02:35:11.101
GO TO. I LIVE IN DAVIS RIGHT

02:35:11.168 --> 02:35:12.469
THE HOSPITAL IN DAVIS IT'S NOT

02:35:12.536 --> 02:35:13.737
A CATHOLIC HOSPITAL AND MIGHT

02:35:13.804 --> 02:35:14.772
BE THAT THEY TRANSFER YOU

02:35:14.838 --> 02:35:16.040
BECAUSE IT'S NOT A HUGE

02:35:16.106 --> 02:35:17.775
HOSPITAL. SO THEY TRANSFER THE

02:35:17.841 --> 02:35:19.410
TRAUMA PATIENTS SACRAMENTO FOR

02:35:19.476 --> 02:35:22.312
EXAMPLE BUT THAT DOESN'T THAT

02:35:22.379 --> 02:35:25.315
HITS PATIENTS RANDOMLY RIGHT IT

02:35:25.382 --> 02:35:26.050
DOESN'T HIT THAT DIRECTLY BASED

02:35:26.116 --> 02:35:29.153
ON THEIR IDENTITY. IS RULES

02:35:29.219 --> 02:35:30.254
DIGITAL. THANK YOU FOR THAT

02:35:30.320 --> 02:35:32.189
IT'S A MATTER OF LIKE CAN DOWN

02:35:32.256 --> 02:35:34.725

02:35:34.792 --> 02:35:36.260
I WAS. I SHOWED UP IN A

02:35:36.326 --> 02:35:37.127

02:35:37.194 --> 02:35:38.962
AN APPENDICITIS I WOULD BEEN

02:35:39.029 --> 02:35:40.064
ONE OF THOSE ROUTINE CASES

02:35:40.130 --> 02:35:42.132
TURNED OUT I WAS PREGNANT. AND

02:35:42.199 --> 02:35:43.033

SEEKING RETRACTED HAIR BE THAT

02:35:48.305 --> 02:35:51.241
KIND OF GUIDANCE AS I DID

02:35:51.308 --> 02:35:53.110
THROUGH MY TREATMENT. I'M SO I

02:35:53.177 --> 02:35:54.878
AM I AND THIS GOES TO SOMETHING

02:35:54.945 --> 02:35:57.081
THAT EVAN HAS SPOKEN ABOUT IN

02:35:57.147 --> 02:35:58.849
GREAT DEPTH WHICH IS GETTING

02:35:58.916 --> 02:36:01.251
ENDING UP RECAP ACOSTA- AND NOT

02:36:01.318 --> 02:36:02.386
EVEN KNOWING THE LIMITATIONS

02:36:02.453 --> 02:36:04.421
CASOS WILL YOU SPOKE ABOUT THAT

02:36:04.488 --> 02:36:05.489
A LOT PROFESSOR FRIEDMAN IN

YOUR TESTIMONY YOU EXPLAIN MORE

02:36:07.191 --> 02:36:08.959
ABOUT WHY PATIENTS ARE ENDING

02:36:09.026 --> 02:36:09.593
UP AT THESE HOSPITALS AND DON'T

02:36:09.660 --> 02:36:11.762

IN THOSE CLOSEST HOSPITAL TO

02:36:21.405 --> 02:36:23.941
ME. AND THAT'S WHERE MY DOCTOR

02:36:24.007 --> 02:36:24.641
ALWAYS PERFORMS HER

02:36:24.708 --> 02:36:26.443
HYSTERECTOMIES. AND SO SHE JUST

02:36:26.510 --> 02:36:27.644

KNOW TO LOOK FOR OR ANYTHING

02:36:43.127 --> 02:36:44.661
LIKE THAT I DON'T BELIEVE

02:36:44.728 --> 02:36:45.496
THERE'S SOMETHING IN WASHINGTON

02:36:45.562 --> 02:36:47.698

02:36:47.765 --> 02:36:51.168
AS- LAW TO- TO. DEMAND

02:36:51.235 --> 02:36:52.603
DISCLOSURE. BUT HIDDEN IN A

02:36:52.669 --> 02:36:57.007
WEBSITE AND SO ANYWAY ONE OF

02:36:57.074 --> 02:36:59.510
THE MAIN ANSWERS. AS THEY'RE

02:36:59.576 --> 02:37:02.146
JUST IN A LIBRARY AT TO TAKE

02:37:02.212 --> 02:37:02.746
THE RELIGIOUS SYMBOLS OUT OF

02:37:02.813 --> 02:37:04.114
THE BRANDING AND A LOT OF

02:37:04.181 --> 02:37:05.682
HOSPITALS AND IF YOU'LL

BOTH MEN AND IT'S A LITTLE

02:37:10.454 --> 02:37:12.956
CONFUSING DIGNITY DOESN'T SOUND

02:37:13.023 --> 02:37:14.391
PARTICULARLY- RELIGIOUS TO MOST

02:37:14.458 --> 02:37:18.061
PEOPLE AND I'M YOU KNOW A

02:37:18.128 --> 02:37:18.796
CATHOLIC HEALTH INITIATIVES

02:37:18.862 --> 02:37:20.664
WILL BECOME COMMON SPEAK IT IN

02:37:20.731 --> 02:37:23.400
A CITY NAMES OR NAMES OF MOST

02:37:23.467 --> 02:37:27.137
HOSPITALS HAVE KIND OF TAKEN

02:37:27.204 --> 02:37:28.505
THAT THE SAINTS OUT OR THE- AS-

02:37:28.572 --> 02:37:31.542
REALLY. THREE BUT OF INTERVIEWS.

02:37:31.608 --> 02:37:32.643
THEIR WOMEN THROUGHOUT THE

02:37:32.709 --> 02:37:35.045
COUNTRY MANY OF THEM- CHRIS

02:37:35.112 --> 02:37:37.347
CHEN RELATIVELY RELIGIOUS AND

02:37:37.414 --> 02:37:39.950
THEY DON'T ANTICIPATE- MOST OF

02:37:40.017 --> 02:37:40.918
THESE RESTRICTIONS AND THEY

02:37:40.984 --> 02:37:42.786
OFTEN SAY- I JUST THOUGHT THE

02:37:42.853 --> 02:37:44.388
LAW WITH THE LAW LIKE IF YOU'RE

02:37:44.454 --> 02:37:45.889
A HOSPITAL YOU HAVE TO OFFER

02:37:45.956 --> 02:37:47.457
THE LEGAL STUFF THAT'S A VERY

02:37:47.524 --> 02:37:48.992
COMMON PERSPECTIVE THEY DON'T

02:37:49.059 --> 02:37:51.829
EXPECT THEIR PHYSICIANS TO SAY

02:37:51.895 --> 02:37:53.397
SORRY I'M BOUND BY THE CATHOLIC

02:37:53.463 --> 02:37:57.167
CHURCH ONE THING I DO WANT TO

02:37:57.234 --> 02:37:58.435
ADD IS THAT. IN CALIFORNIA WE

02:37:58.502 --> 02:38:01.805
HAVE A REQUIREMENT THAT.

02:38:01.872 --> 02:38:04.641
INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE TO-

02:38:04.708 --> 02:38:07.778
PROVIDE NOTICE WHEN THEY HAVE

02:38:07.845 --> 02:38:09.179
HOSPITALS IN THE NETWORK THAT

02:38:09.246 --> 02:38:12.249
ARE- RESTRICTING CARE IT'S

02:38:12.316 --> 02:38:14.785
SOMETHING THAT FEW INSURANCE-

02:38:14.852 --> 02:38:17.554
PLANS ACTUALLY DO IN A WAY

02:38:17.621 --> 02:38:20.390
THAT'S TRANSPARENT AND VISIBLE

02:38:20.457 --> 02:38:22.125
FOR ENROLLEES AND NOT COULD.IS

02:38:22.192 --> 02:38:23.927
SOMETHING THAT- ADVOCATES IN

02:38:23.994 --> 02:38:25.696
THE STATES HAVE TALKED ABOUT-

02:38:25.762 --> 02:38:28.799
AWAY TO KIND OF UP THAT- KIND

02:38:28.866 --> 02:38:30.467
OF PRESSURE ON THE INSURANCE

02:38:30.534 --> 02:38:32.836
COMPANIES SO THAT FOLKS IN THE

02:38:32.903 --> 02:38:34.304

02:38:46.917 --> 02:38:48.118
OBLIGATION ON THE INSURANCE
