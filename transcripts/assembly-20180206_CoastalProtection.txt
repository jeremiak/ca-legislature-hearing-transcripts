EVERYONE. TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE ACOSTA PROTECTION AND ACCESS TO NATURAL RESOURCES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S ATTENDANCE HERE THIS IS THE FIRST HEARING FOR THIS SELECT COMMITTEE FOR THE YEAR AND. HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE A FEW MORE CONTINUE WHICH THINK TOPICS. VERY HAPPY TO HAVE OPC HERE AND THIS. GREAT SET OF PANELS. TO TALK ABOUT. YOUR GRASS AND CAL AND. HOW WE MANAGE CHANGING OCEAN CHEMISTRY IS FOR THE BETTER IS WE ALL KNOW? THAT EVEN THOUGH ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL THEY DON'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND. PROGRESS WE'VE BEEN MAKING WE'RE GONNA SEE CONTINUING CALIFORNIA TO MAKE PROGRESS MITIGATING AND ADAPTING TO THE EFFECTS OF OUR CHANGING CLIMATE. AND OCEAN ACIDIFICATION HYPOXIA THE CHANGING CHEMISTRY IN THE OCEAN IS CLEARLY. AT ISSUE FOR CALIFORNIA THAT WE'RE WORKING ON. AND. SUBMERGED AQUATIC VEGETATION FOR ME IS ALSO VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE. BACK IN MY DAYS ARE COASTAL COMMISSION WE ARE CHINA PROTECTS AND MANAGE A LOT OF THE EELGRASS BECAME AN IMPORTANT PART. OF. PERMIT DISCUSSIONS AROUND DEVELOPMENT VARIOUS PARTS OF THE STATE. AND ONE THINKS IT'S VERY TRUE AS WE ALL KNOW. IF YOU WANT HELP OUR ENVIRONMENT WE GO PLANT A TREE. DOES NOT WORK THE SAME FOR SUBMERGED AQUATIC VEGETATION IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY WE'RE GONNA MITIGATE THE LOSS OF YOUR GRASS IN ONE PLACE. PLANTED IN ANOTHER AND EXPECTED SUCCESS IN FACT A LOT OF THE MEDICATIONS THAT THE COAST COMMISSION LOOKED AT OVER THE YEARS WERE MARGINALLY SUCCESSFUL. SO EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS A DEVELOPMENT THAT WAS PERMITTED BASED ON A CERTAIN. MITIGATION STRATEGYTHIS MITIGATION STRATEGIES DO NOT ALWAYS HAVE. THE FACTS AND SO THE MORE WE COULD WORK TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS COURT OF VEGETATION WORKS. WHERE IT WORKS AND THOUGH THE BROADER IMPACTS IT CAN HAVE ON PROTECTING OUR OCEANS AND OUR COASTAL RESOURCES I THINK THE MORE SIGNIFICANT IT ADDS? AND THE OTHER. LOGISTICAL REASON OF ARE HAPPY TO BE DOING THIS HERE TODAY IS I WOULD LIKE TO DO MORE. WE SINCE I COME FROM COUNTY AWAY AND WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION THE EXECUTIVE IN THE JUDICIAL ARE ALSO OF TIED TOGETHER. THAT THREE SEPARATE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT DON'T ALWAYS WORK THAT WELL TOGETHER AND OSHA PRODUCTION TAP COUNSEL DOES A VERY GOOD JOB A LOT OF THE STATE AGENCIES A VERY GOOD JOB REPORTING TO. THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT WHAT SOME THE CHALLENGES ARE. BUT I WANTED TO BRING THESE CONVERSATIONS INTO THE LEGISLATURE SO THAT WE CAN BE A PART OF SOME OF THE IDEAS THE POLICY CHANGES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS WORKING ON. AND UNDERSTAND REALLY HOW TO BE YOUR PARTNERS. IN WORKING IN ASSURING WERE WORKING STRATEGIES TO BETTER CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENT TO ADAPTS TO MITIGATE TO MANAGE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AND IF ANYBODY'S BEEN INVOLVED IN SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS YOU KNOW THAT MEMBERS TO COME AND GO. THIS IS BEING WEB CAST IT'S BEING TELEVISED IT'S IT'S AVAILABLE SO WE ARE CREATING A VERY A PORTENT LEGISLATIVE RECORD HERE TODAY. SO EVEN IF WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS SHOWING UP WHERE THE SHOPS RADICALLY BASED ON SCHEDULES THIS IS STILL AN IMPORTANT PART OF HOW WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS. AND I KNOW LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE INTERESTED IN POLICY MEASURES. LOOKING FOR PRODUCTIVE WAYS THAT WE CAN IN OUR LEGISLATIVE CONTACTS BE OF ASSISTANCE IN. THAT MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION QUESTIONS AND THAT'S WHY DOING THIS AND SAID CONTEXT I THINK IS SO IMPORTANT. SO LET'S START WITH THE HEARING. WE HAVE. A COUPLE DIFFERENT PANELS WERE GONNA GO TO THE FIRST PANEL IS STATE PERSPECTIVES AND WE HAVE CALIFORNIA. SECRETARY NATURAL RESOURCES JOHN THERE'D HERE CHEN ALWAYS VERY HAPPY TO HAVE YOU COME PRESENT BACK IN THE LEGISLATURE'S YOU HAD DONE FOR SO MANY YEARS. THEN DEBORAH HOPPER SAID WHO'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL. VERY SMALL CHIEF DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY. AND THEY WERE GONNA HEAR FROM THE OPC SCIENCE ADVISORY TEAM CREATED NIELSEN FROM TARA FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY AND JAY STOCK WAS FROM UC DAVIS. TALKING A BIT MORE IN SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE RESEARCH THAT HAS BEEN DONE. BRINGING THE SCIENCE PERSPECTIVE IN THE POLICY IS HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PORN BUT NOW IT'S INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT. ESPECIALLY WITH A LOT OF THE RECENT DENIALS OF THE VALUE OF SCIENCE IN POLICY MAKING. WE ARE GOING TO USE IT TO THE BEST EXTENT WE CAN THAT'S WHAT THIS HEARING IS ABOUT SO I LOOK FORWARD TO IT. SECRETARY LEAD GOING TO LEAD US OFF THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I APOLOGIZE BECAUSE I CAN ONLY STAY FOR ABOUT THE FIRST HALF HOUR STEERING BUT. A I WAS AMUSED WHEN YOU SAID IT MAY HEARING LEGISLATORS COME AND GO THAT'S ALSO TRUE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE. I HAD A MUCH DELAYED POST MATIC STRESS BY COMING TO THIS ROOM A OF. A GIVEN SOME OF THEM WANT THE HEARINGS THAT. THAT I EXPERIENCED IN HERE. BAR I WANT TO TAKE MY BRIEF TIME TO MAYBE SET THE CONTEXT OF FOR THIS HEARING. AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING IT BECAUSE IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND ONE WHERE THE LIGHT NEEDS TO BE SHOWN. EVEN WHEN. THIS ADMINISTRATION TEN MEN. WE WERE NOT REALLY DOING MUCH ON THE ISSUE OF OCEAN ACIDIFICATION AND AND TRYING TO TAKE A STRATEGIC PLAN THAT HAD JUST BEEN ADOPTED THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL AND GIVE IT PRIORITIES. ONE OF THE FOUR PRIORITIES. HOW I REALLY GOT EVERYBODY TO MOVE WITH WAS TO TRY TO ATTACK THE ISSUE OF OCEAN ACIDIFICATION? AND IN DOING IT IN AND TWENTY THIRTEEN. I CONVENED. A PANEL A SCIENTIFIC PANEL BUT TO DEAL WITH THIS AND HAS A WASHINGTON AND OREGON. WERE HAVING VERY SIMILAR ISSUES. AND PARTICULARLY WASHINGTON WITH WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THEIR SHELLFISH INDUSTRY IN PUGET SOUND. IT WAS A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THE EFFORT MERGED. INTO A THREE STATE EFFORT AND IT LED TO A STUDY. THAT JUNE WAS DONE AND RELEASED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND IT WAS A VERY UNIQUE STUDY BECAUSE MANY TIMES. YOU LOOK AT THE SCIENCE AND USE. HERE'S THE SCIENCE OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITH OCEAN ACIDIFICATION BUT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY GET ATTACHED TO IT WHAT EARLY ACTIONS ARE THAT YOU CAN TAKE. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS STUDY DID AND THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE. THAT WORKED ON THAT THAT ARE GOING TO CONFORM YOU AND. AS A LAY PERSON THAT WERE ALL INDS OF THINGS IN THERE WHERE I HAD REALLY YOU. TRY TO HARDEN THE SHELLS OF SOME OF THE SHELLFISH THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS YOU DO. BUT THERE WERE. MANY DIFFERENT ACTIONS AND THEN WE WENT TO THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL. ANNA APPROPRIATED SOME REMAINING BOND TO HOLLERS FOR ABOUT THREE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS. PART OF. SORT OF WORK TO DO SOME OF ARE PART OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STUDY AND THE ACTIONS. AND. THAT LEGISLATURE ALSO PASSED TWO BILLS OUR THANKS TO A TO A STRONG PUBLIC SUPPORT. AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE. TO DO THE ADVISORY TEAM AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE MANDATED BY THOSE BILLS. BUT IN THE OVERVIEW I THINK THE THING THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO ME. IS THAT AS THE ADMINISTRATION IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE HAS MOVED THROUGH CAP AND TRADE. ROOM CAP AND TRADE IN MANY WAYS. AND HAS NOT INTERSECTED WITH THE OCEAN. OF BECAUSE THERE REALLY INTO IT TO TWO REALLY JUSTIFY IT IN THE FIRST ITERATION OF CAP AND TRADE MEET THE TIGHTEST OF LEGAL TESS. YOU HAD TO HAVE DEMONSTRATED SCIENCE. THAT SHOWED THAT YOU WERE CAPTURING CARBON YOU COULD QUANTIFY AVOID PROVE IT. AND IN MANY WHY SOME OF THE STUDIES THAT WE HAVE AHA EMBARKED ON. WITH THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL MONEY. IS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT AND HAVE THE SCIENTIFIC BASIS THAT IF IN FUTURE ROUNDS WE THINK THAT THERE IS CARBON CAPTURE TO BE MADE BY THE VERY SUBJECT OF THIS HEARING. THAN WE HAVE LAID THE SCIENTIFIC BASIS TO DO IT. AND I THINK THE CHALLENGES AND. THE CHAIRMAN AS A MEMBER OF THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL AND HE HEARD ME GIFT THIS LITTLE RIFF AT THE MEETING LAST WEEK. THE CHALLENGES IS THE PERFECT WORLD OF SCIENCE THAT'S NOT ALWAYS INTERSECT WITH GOVERNMENT JOB LINES OF POLITICAL REALITIES. AND SO YES WE WANT IT PEER REVIEW AND YES WE WANT BELLS AND WHISTLES TO PROVE IT EXACTLY. BUT THE OCEANS DETERIORATING ADMINISTRATIONS ARE CHANGING. HOW WE HAVE THE POLITICAL WILL AND THE ABILITY TO DO IT AND WE WOULD LIKE TO INTERSECT THE TO IN ITS AYE PLENTIFULLY SAID AT THE MEETING THE OTHER DAY WE WOULD LIKE IT TO THE SCIENCE DONE SOMETIME IN THE COURSE OF OUR NATURAL LIFE? AND AND SO BAD IT'S OUR CHALLENGE INNER IT IS DOING THAT AND. WE ALSO HAVE THE CHALLENGE YOU ALLUDED TO WHICH IS OUR WHAT'S GOING ON ARE NOT GOING ON AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW. AND SO. WITH THE RELATIONSHIPS WE BUILT. WITH WASHINGTON AND OREGON. WE LAUNCHED THE INTERNATIONAL ALLIANCE TO FIGHT OCEAN ACIDIFICATION. ALONG THE LINES. OF THE PARIS CLIMATE COURTS WHERE WE GET INDIVIDUAL NATIONS. OR. SUB STATES TO COME IN AND MAKE THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL COMMITMENTS ON WHAT THEYWILL DO AND AGREED TO MAKE THOSE COMMITMENTS ON THE CERTIFICATION AND. THE EARLY INITIATORS ON IT WAS LAUNCHED BY OUR GOVERNOR IN THE GOVERNOR'S OF WASHINGTON AND OREGON. รณ WE HAD FRANCE AND CHILE JOIN US. IT CENTS BENT ICELAND THE AMORITES FIJI'S AND I KEEP SAYING COUNTRIES IN THE PACIFIC THAT I'VE NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE. BUT IT IS BROADENING. AND IT IS TRYING TO TAKE THAT COMMITMENT AND MAKE SURE THAT WE WE DO IT. AND SO THERE ARE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS HEARING. IS IT EDUCATES THE LEGISLATORS ABOUT HOW THIS IS ONE OPPORTUNITY OVER TIME TO DO IT. AND YOU CAN HELP US WITH THAT KIND OF PRESSURE. KEEP MOVING. AND RIGHT NOW I'M LOOKING AT THREE LEGISLATOR STEP WILL BE HERE. FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AFTER I'M SECRETARY AND. THAT IS DONE AND SO I AM HOPING FAT. THAT KIND OF INSTITUTIONAL PUSH WILL RESIDE ITSELF WITH YOU. AND THINGS THAT WE HAVE STARTED IT MIGHT THE GROUNDWORK FOR TO DEAL WITH CAP AND TRADE INTERNATIONAL CONNECTIONS TO EDUCATION ON THE SCIENCE. AND MOVING EVERYBODY ALONG WILL BE SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO TAKE FORWARD AS WELL SO. THOSE ARE THE OPENING COMMENTS I WANT TO MAKE A MINUTE TURN IT OVER TO DEBRA HOW MUCH THAT IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE OCEAN PROTECTION COMES. THANK YOU SECRETARY LAIRD AND CAN THANK YOU CHAIRMAN STONE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR INVITING US HERE TO TALK TODAY ABOUT AND SEA GRASSES AND CALVIN. THE TERM SUBMERGED AQUATIC VEGETATION. WHICH REALLY AND. OUR PRIOR GOAL HERE IS TO BUILD ON THE MOMENTUM TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND AND BE ABLE TO TAKE ACTION TO. LESSEN THE IMPACTS OF OCEAN ACIDIFICATION I'M SICK AND MY NAME IS DEBORAH HALBERSTADT I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL IS. M.. IS A STATE ENTITY THAT'S COMMITTED TO AND MAINTAINING HEALTHY RESILIENT AND PRODUCTIVE OCEAN AND COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS FOR THE BENEFIT OF. CURRENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS AND WE'RE REALLY AND COMMITTED TO BASING OUR DECISIONS ON. BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE AND TO PROMOTING THE USE OF SCIENCE AND. IN ORDER TO MANAGE OCEAN ACTIVITIES IN OCEAN RESEARCHERS REESE RESOURCES AND. WHICH IS WHY WE'RE SO EXCITED TODAY TO BE ABLE TO BRING TOGETHER SCIENTISTS POLICYMAKERS AND MANAGERS TO TALK ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC. AND AS SECRETARY LAIRD DESCRIBED IN DETAIL ARE ARE OCEAN ACIDIFICATION PROGRAM HAS GROWN TREMENDOUSLY OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS STEMMING IN LARGE PART FROM THE RELEASE OF THAT WEST COAST OCEAN ACIDIFICATION AND HYPOXIA SCIENCE PANEL. AND. AND ONE OF THE PANEL'S RECOMMENDATIONS WAS TO ADVANCE APPROACHES THAT REMOVE CARBON DIOXIDE FROM SEA WATER AND SPECIFICALLY. THEIR RECOMMENDATION BECAUSE OUT RESTORATION AND CONSERVATION OF SUBMERGED AQUATIC VEGETATION SUCH AS SEA GRASS AND CAL. AS E. NATURAL STRATEGY TO YOU MEET THIS GOAL COMBAT AS CHAIRMAN STONE MENTIONED AND. THE RESTORATION IS NOT ALWAYS AN EASY TASK WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT AND SEAGRASSES. SO FOLLOWING THE RELEASE OF THE THE PANEL REPORT AND THE STATE LEGISLATURE PASSED TWO BILLS. IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PANEL. ONE OF THESE BILLS SENATE BILL THIRTEEN SIXTY THREE BECAUSE FOR SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE BASED APPROACHES TO PROTECTING AND RESTORING SEAGRASS AS A CRITICAL STRATEGY IN ENHANCING CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO WITHSTAND. OCEAN ACIDIFICATION AND SO SENATE BILL THIRTEEN SIXTY THREE. I THINK REALLY STARTS TO ADDRESS CHAIRMAN STONE'S COMMENTS ABOUT NEEDING TO INCREASE COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE AND THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCHES SO WE HAD A REPORT THAT WAS COMMISSIONED BY. THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND THEN TAKING UP BY THE LEGISLATURE AND NOW THE LEGISLATURE HAS AND NEED STE SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS. REQUIRING THE OPC TO TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS IS A REALLY NICE M. SYNTHESIS AND AND. PC. I AND OUR REALLY RICH NETWORK OF PARTNERS AND HAVE BEEN MAKING GREAT PROGRESS IN EACH OF THE TASKS OUTLINED IN THE BILL SO THEREFORE. TASKS NUMBER ONE IS RESEARCHING HOW EELGRASS FUNCTIONS FOR CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL AND OCEAN ACIDIFICATION. MITIGATION AND IF FOR THAT WE ARE WORKING ON DEVELOPING A DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS TO RESEARCH HOW IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL FACTORS INTERACT ACROSS SPACE AND TIME. TO INFLUENCE HOW GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED EELGRASS BEDS CAN FUNCTION FOR CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL AND HYPOXIA REDUCTION. I'M IN TO THIS POINT OPC FUNDED SEVERAL INNOVATIVE RESEARCH AND DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS AND IN THESE PROJECTS. ARE INTENDED TO HELP US FILL SOME GAPS IN UNDERSTANDING HOW NATURAL AND RESTORED SEAGRASS BEDS CAN HELP AMELIORATE OCEAN ACIDIFICATION AND UNDERSTANDING ALSO THE. BUFFERING POTENTIAL OF SEA GRASS ON OYSTER AQUACULTURE. I'M SAID TODAY YOU'LL HEAR MORE DETAILS ABOUT THIS FRIEND DOCTOR TESTED HILL WHEN OF THE OPC TIME. FUNDED SCIENTISTS ON WHO WILL BE SPEAKING IN THE SECOND PANEL. AND THE SECOND TASK IS TO GENERATE AN INVENTORY OF LOCATIONS WHERE CONSERVATION OR RESTORATION OF AQUATIC HABITATS INCLUDING L. GRASS CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED TO MITIGATE. OCEAN ACIDIFICATION AND AND RESULTS FROM OPC FUNDED PROJECTS. AND OTHER EFFORTS ARE HELPING TO BUILD AN INFORMANT'S INVENTORY AND A WHERE KEY WHERE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO BUILD OUT THIS INVENTORY WITH FUTURE PROJECTS. I THIRD TASK IS TO INCORPORATE CONSIDERATION OF CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL. FOR YOUR GRASS RESTORATION PROJECTS DURING THE HABITAT RESTORATION PLANNING PROCESS. AND THE GOAL THERE IS TO YOU ACCOUNT FOR THE BENEFITS OF LONG TERM SEQUESTRATION AND. IN ADDITION TO THE HABITAT RESTORATION SO THAT'S REALLY GETTING AT NOT JUST THE. AND. AWAY NOT NOT JUST THAT ADAPTATION PART OF. OF. SEE GAS BUT ALSO THE MITIGATION POTENTIAL. AND. SO AS SCIENCE ON CARBON STORAGE BY EELGRASS ADVANCES STATE LED RESTORATION OF YOUR GRASS WILL BE ABLE TO REALLY THINK THERE AND CONSIDER THE BENEFITTED CARBON STORAGE AS ONE OF THE MANY CO BENEFITS HAVE. AND RESTORATION AND MARY SMALL FROM THE C. COASTAL CONSERVANCY WILL BE REPORTING ON SOME OF. AT THE ADVANCES ON THIS FRONT. AND FINALLY NUMBER FOUR OF OUR TASKS IS TO SUPPORT SCIENCE MONITORING COORDINATION TO ENSURE THAT OCEAN AND COASTAL POLICY AND MANAGEMENT CALIFORNIA. REFLECT THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE ON STRATEGIES TO REDUCE OCEAN ACIDIFICATION HYPOXIA SO THIS IS WHERE OPC ALONG WITH OUR PARTNERS LIKE THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY AND LIKE THE OCEAN SCIENCE TRUST. LAKE OUR OPC SAT AND WORK TOGETHER TO STRENGTHEN OUR COLLABORATION AND AND REALLY DEVELOP AND SOME KEY RECOMMENDATIONS AND PROGRESS THAT CAN COME OUT OF THE RESEARCH THAT'S HAPPENING. AND. SO THESE PROJECTS AND SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES ARE REALLY CRUCIAL TO BETTER UNDERSTANDING ALL OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE LEGISLATION. BUT WITH AND WITHOUT. FUNDING FROM THE LEGISLATION WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO UTILIZE STEVE FUNDS TO IMPLEMENT THE TASKS IN SB THIRTEEN SIXTY THREE AND VOTE AS SECRETARY LAIRD MENTIONED JUST A MOMENT AGO. FUTURE FUNDING WILL REALLY BE CRITICAL IN ADVANCING OUR WORK ON THIS TOPIC. AND. EVEN WITH ALL OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING IN WITH OUR EMERGING UNDERSTANDING THERE'S STILL A LOT THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY. TIME ASSOCIATED WITH USING THESE HABITATS TO MITIGATE OCEAN ACIDIFICATION AND YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT FROM HER OUR SECOND PANEL. AND WE ARE REALLY WORKING HARD TO ENSURE THAT THE BEST SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN MAKE MANAGEMENT DECISIONS. WHILE BEING BOLD AND WHILE BEING VISIONARY AND SO FOR EXAMPLE. WHEN WE DO LEARN ABOUT HOW HABITATS CAN HELP AMELIORATE OCEAN ACIDIFICATION THAT WE WANT TO FOLLOW THAT SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE WITH PILOT. I RESTORATION PROJECTS THAT WE CAN PARTNER WITH THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY ON AND BUILD ON OUR KNOWLEDGE WHILE REALLY IMPLEMENTING ON THE GROUND PROJECTS. AND. WE'RE REALLY COMMITTED TO PROTECTING RESTORING THESE HABITATS BOTH FOR THE ECOSYSTEM. BENEFITS THEY PROVIDE AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL FOR AND. A CLIMATE CHANGE READINESS THAT THEY THAT THEY MAY PROVIDE AND AND WE WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK ON THESE PROJECTS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANNEX I'D LIKE TO ASK INTRODUCED MARRY SMALL FROM THE STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY AND SHE CAN SPEAK MORE. ON THEIR EFFORTS AT THE CONSERVANCY. OKAY THANK YOU DEBORAH THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. AND. AND AS AS EVER SAID I'M GONNA SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY'S ROLE IN THIS WORLD AND PRIMARILY SUPPORTING PILOT PROJECTS. PROJECTS THAT TIED TOGETHER. EXPERIMENTAL RESTORATION WITH SCIENCE AND MONITORING. AND TRYING TO ADVANCE MULTI BENEFIT PROJECTS IN THIS CONTEXT. DOES THIS WORK. NOW. I GET. SO AND THIS IS A SCHEMATIC OF JUST SORT OF TRYING TO. BUILD IN A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT AND BECAUSE OF AN SEVENTY WERE REALLY TRYING TO THINK ABOUT RESTORING MORE COMPLETE HABITAT SYSTEMS SO I LIKE TO SAY WETLAND RESTORATION ISN'T JUST WETLANDS ANYMORE. BUT IT'S LOOKING AT THE TRANSITIONAL UPLAND IT'S LOOKING AT THE TRANSITIONAL SUBTITLE HABITAT AND RESTORING THESE MORE COMPLETE SYSTEMS BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE ECOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS. THAT HAPPEN AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT IS CLIMATE CHANGE. HAPPENS THERE'S GOING TO BE A. NEED FOR THAT INTEGRITY ACROSS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM. WE ALSO KNOW THAT SUBTITLE HABITATS PROVIDE A WHOLE HOST OF BENEFITS THE SORT OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES TO HUMANS THEY. PROVIDE. HOW IMPORTANT HABITAT FOR COMMERCIAL AND RECREATIONAL FISHERIES? THEY CAN HELP ACCRETE SEDIMENT AND REDUCE WAVE ENERGY TO PROTECT OUR SHORELINES REDUCE EROSION BY THE SYSTEMS CAN SEQUESTER CARBON. AND AS YOU'LL HEAR LATER THEY THEY CAN HELP BUFFER FROM OCEAN ACIDIFICATION. AND LET'S HARD TO READ BUT AND. AS I SAID THE SYSTEMS DO SEQUESTER CARBON AND. THE CAUSE OF CONSERVANCY WORKED WITH THE DELTA CONSERVANCY NDW ARE. ENDS WHEN ROCK AMERICAN CARBON REGISTRY TO DEVELOP A PROTOCOL FOR CARBON SEQUESTRATION OF COASTAL AND FRESHWATER WETLANDS IN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S IN THE VOLUNTARY CARBON. SYSTEM AND THE RATES ARE REALLY REALLY HIGH. UP FOR EELGRASS AND SEAGRASSES WE KNOW GLOBALLY THAT THOSE SYSTEMS ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO CARBON SEQUESTRATION. BUT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ENOUGH DATA IN CALIFORNIA TO ASSESS HOW OUR SPECIES PERFORM YOU GUYS CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT I THINK THIS IS TRUE THAT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW IT UP. AND ONE OF THE BIG GAPS AS WE ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE GREAT MAPPING STATEWIDE OF EELGRASS ANNUAL GRASS POTENTIAL. AND SO THAT'S A THAT'S A DATA NEED. WE'LL TALK ABOUT A COUPLE OF THE PILOT PROJECTS THAT WE'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN YEAH. AND THIS IS A PICTURE OF SOME HELP RESTORATION THAT HAS BEEN DONE IN SANTA MONICA BAY THE BAY FOUNDATION BEGAN. HELP RESTORATION TWENTY YEARS AGO THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY PROVIDED FUNDING IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS. AND REALLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS GOING INTO. URCHIN BARONS AND REDUCING THE DENSITY OF THE URCHINS. I'M WHERE THEY HAD WHERE THEY BECOME REALLY REALLY DANCE THAT HELP IT IT DECIMATES THE KELP FOREST AND THEY FIND THAT IF THEY REDUCE THE DENSITY IS. THAT THE KELP ACTUALLY COMES BACK UP AND SOME OF THE SITES HAVE PERSISTED FOR A LONG TIME. WE HAVE A CURRENT GRANT WITH THE BAY FOUNDATION TO STUDY THAT. A FACT OF THE KELP ON WAVE ATTENUATION AND TO THIS MEASURE WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S ANY PHYSICAL BENEFIT TO THE SHORELINE. THAT DATA COLLECTION IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW SO WE ARE HOPING TO HAVE A REPORT OUT. TOWARDS THE END OF THE YEAR. IN YEAH SAN FRANCISCO BAY WE'VE IN THE. BEEN INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF SUBTITLE HABITAT PROJECTS. I WAS SUPPORT FROM THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL THE CONSERVANCY HELPED DEVELOP THE SAN FRANCISCO SUBTITLE HABITAT GOALS REPORT. WHICH IS REALLY A LONG TERM FIFTY YEAR PLAN FOR SUBTITLE HABITAT RESTORATION IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY IT WAS REALLY THE FIRST TIME. LOOK AT THE SUBTITLE OPPORTUNITIES AND WE APPRECIATE A PC SUPPORT OF THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IT RECOMMENDED WAS THAT WE START TO DO PILOT RESTORATIONPROJECTS WITH A REAL EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN. AND SO WE HAVE BEEN DOING PATS WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH SEVEN CISCO STATE AND KATHY PLAYERS LACK OF BEEN LEADING THAT SCIENCE. DOING PILOT RESTORATION PROJECTS WHERE WE PLANT YOUR GRASS WE INSTALL THEM. OYSTER SUBSTRATE AND NOW AND SEE IF THE OYSTERS WILL COME BACK. I AND NUMBER MONITORING BOTH THE BIOLOGICAL RESPONSE AND THE PHYSICAL BENEFITS OF THOSE PROJECTS CAN THEY ACTUALLY REDUCE WAVE ENERGY AT THE SHORE. DO WE SEE SETTLEMENT ACCRETION. DEAN OF THE NEXT SLIDE. AND. THEY'RE INCREDIBLY PRODUCTIVE. AMAZING RESPONSE FROM THE SYSTEMS WE HAD TWO MILLION OYSTERS WHAT IT WITH AN ESTIMATE BUT. THAT'S THE WAY THAT I IN THE FIRST YEAR AND WE'RE SEEING REALLY DRAMATIC. SURVIVAL OF THE L. GRASS. AND SOME. SOME ENERGY DISSIPATION AND PRETTY AYE EXCITING LEVELS OF SEDIMENTATION SO WE THINK IT CAN BE PART OF AN INTEGRATED STRATEGY. FOR HELPING AND. ADOPTED CLIMATE CHANGE AND HELPING TO BRING BACK THE SYSTEMS. I'M HERE TO THE NEXT SLIDE I WANNA PUT A LITTLE BIT OF A WORD OF CAUTION IT'S HARD TO EVEN REMEMBER. THE LAST WINTER WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE SWEATER. AND SAN FRANSISCO BAY THAT BIG CHART SHOWS THE SALINITY IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY WHICH ACTUALLY TURNED INTO A FRESH WATER SYSTEM FOR. A PRETTY PROLONGED PERIOD OF TIME THAT THERE WAS SO MUCH FRESH WATER COMING OUT. AND THAT PRETTY MUCH DECIMATED OUR YELL GRASS AND OUR OYSTERS. NOT ENTIRELY UNEXPECTED WE KNOW THE SYSTEMS FLUCTUATE WE KNOW THE BAY FLUCTUATES. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AS WE THINK ABOUT HOW TO USE. THE SYSTEMS TO HELP. PROVIDE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AND ADDRESS THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE TO REALIZE THAT THEY'RE ALSO GOING TO BE AT THE FRONT LINES OF TAKING THE HITS. OF CRIME VARIABILITY AND KIND IMPACTS. AND IT REALLY IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE DID WAS TERENCE'S CHO STATE WHERE THEY WERE MONITORING IN REAL TIME. THE SYSTEM SO WE KNEW THAT WE HAD THE BOSS OF THE OYSTERS AND YELL GRASS. AND NOW WE'RE MONITORING THE RECOVERY OF THE SYSTEMS I'M AND I SHOULD SAY IT WASN'T JUST A RESTORED SITES BUT ILL GRASS AND MANY PARTS OF THE BAY THAT HAD BEEN THERE FOR DECADES. WAS ALSO IMPACTED BY THIS EVENT. AND AND WE'RE WORKING WITH SANTA TO ALSO FIGURE OUT WHERE WE'RE GONNA GO BACK CAN BE PLANT SO. THAT'S MY OTHER POINT IS THAT I THINK. SO I THINK THE PARTNERSHIPS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT BUT ALSO THAT THIS ISN'T RESTORATION NECESSARILY LIKE YOU BUILD AT ONCE AND. AND YOU'RE GOOD TO GO. BUT WE MAY NEED TO ACTUALLY COME BACK AND REPLANT SOME OF THE SITES WE MAY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BALANCE. AND. THAT WE HELP PRESERVE THE BALANCE AND AND PRESERVE THESE ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS. INTO THE NOT SLIDE THIS IS JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE WHICH YOU VERY WELL MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT BUT. IN THE NORTH COAST AND THAT ABOVE HOT WATER BLOB IN THE OCEAN THE SEAS ARE WASTING DISEASE HAS LED TO. I'M CREATION OF VIRGIN BARREN SPENT A REALLY DRAMATIC LOSS OF THE CAL. AND AGAIN. THAT'S SORT OF THE IMPACTS OF THESE CLIMATIC VARIABILITY PLAYING OUT ON THE SYSTEMS. BY I THINK THE HOPEFUL PART OF THAT YOU CAN GET THE LAST SLIDE. IS THAT WE'RE SEEING THESE PARTNERSHIPS OF STATE AGENCIES RESEARCHERS FISHERMEN. HAPPY HAPPY RESEARCHERS. PLAYING IN THE MUD AND BY COMING TOGETHER AND AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW HOW WE CAN HELP RESTORE THE SYSTEMS AND. AND MOVE FORWARD. RIGHT NOW I'M SORRY AS MOST INTRODUCED. BE THAT. AS I WOULDN'T IT OVER THE GREEN AND YELLOW. THANK YOU. MY NAME AND FOR CONTEXT TO THIS IS BAD SORT OF TOP DOWN IF YOU WILL. THAT'S RESOURCES AGENCY OSHA PROTECTION COUNCIL BECAUSE CONSERVANCY AND NOW AND KARINA. SUBMERGED AQUATIC VEGETATION OCEANS EDUCATION WORKING GROUP OF THE SCIENCE ADVISORY. TEAM FOR THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL KIND OF WORKING ON THIS QUESTION SORE STARTING NARROW GETTING MORE SPECIFIC AND INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE THE SCIENTIFIC DETAILS. FOR A MOVE ON THE NEXT PANEL SO WHEN I FINISH THIS PANEL THEN WILL TAKE QUESTIONS FROM. FROM THE DIET SO CLEAN AND GREEN GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE. ARE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. BIKING VERITY INTRODUCE ME SO I WON'T SAY MY NAME AGAIN. BUT WE ARE HERE AS CO CHAIRS OF THIS. WORKING GROUP ON SUBMERGED AQUATICVEGETATION. WHICH PARTICULAR FOCUS ON SEA GRASS OR ILL GRASSES AND CAL. AND HOW IT MAY BE USEFUL AS AN OCEAN ACIDIFICATION MANAGEMENT TOOL IN CALIFORNIA MORE SPECIFICALLY. AS. YOU UNDOUBTEDLY KNOW ANNA'S EMERGED FROM. NUMEROUS STUDIES INCLUDING OUR OWN. WEST COAST. OCEAN ACIDIFICATION HYPOXIA PANEL THE US WEST COAST IS EXPOSED TO SOME OF THE LOWEST AND MOST VARIABLE P. H. WATERS RECORDED ON A FOR THE SURFACE OCEAN. HUMAN CAUSED OCEAN ACIDIFICATION ARE AWAY IS INCREASING THE ACIDITY OF THESE WATERS AND THE US WEST COAST IS ONE OF THE FIRST PLACES WHERE WE EXPECT TO SEE. BIOLOGICAL IMPACTS OF OCEAN ACIDIFICATION SO. ECHOING THE REMARK THAT WE ARE ON THE FRONT LINES HERE. NICK SITE PLEASE. OUR GROUP WAS CHARGED WITH. THINKING ABOUT HOW RESTORATION PROTECTION AND CULTIVATION OF COASTAL AN EXTREME SUBMERGED AQUATIC VEGETATION YOU'LL SEE IT. SOMETIMES IN THE PRESENTATION ABBREVIATED AS SAB AT THAT REFERS THAT HELP IN THE SEA GRASSES ON HOW HOW THIS VEGETATION UNDERWATER MAY CONTRIBUTE. TO CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGIES. THAT WAS OUR QUESTION. OF COURSE I LIKE ALL PLANTS. THE SUBMERGED AQUATIC VEGETATION PHOTOSYNTHESIZE IS. TAKES. THE ENERGY FROM LIGHT TAKES CARBON DIOXIDE THAT'S IN THE WATER CONVERTS IT INTO PLANT BY AMOUNTS IT RELEASES OXYGEN IN THE PROCESS REQUIRES LIGHT. AND AS YOU CAN SEE UNDER CERTAIN SITUATIONS AND THOSE FRANZ RIGHT THERE THOSE THOSE BLADES OF GRASS THAT BUBBLES ON THEM FROM THE PRODUCTION OF OXYGEN SYSTEM YOU DON'T OFTEN GET TO SEE AN AIR BUT IT'S. AN INTERESTING PHENOMENON TO VISUALIZE THERE SO THAT'S WHAT SUBMERGED AQUATIC VEGETATION HOUSE TO DO WITH OCEAN ACIDIFICATION IT'S THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THEIR PROCESS AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS ON THE WAY THAT THEY REMOVE IT AND TRANSFORM IT INTO BIOMASS. SO THERE ARE TWO WAYS IN WHICH SEAGRASS AND HELP MAY BE BENEFICIAL TO CLIMATE CHINA CHANGE ADAPTATION AND MITIGATION. THROUGH AMELIORATION AND THEIR ABILITY TO INCREASE PH IN THE WATER THROUGH THIS PROCESS OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS. ON AND THEIR POTENTIAL TO SEQUESTER OR STORE CARTMAN SO CALLED BLUE CARBON. THROUGH A VARIETY OF WAYS NEXT SLIDE. THE AMELIORATION PIECE IS THE PART THAT YOU WILL PROBABLY HEAR MOST ABOUT TODAY. AND THAT IS THE WAYS IN WHICH ACTIVE PHOTOSYNTHESIS CAN ACTUALLY INCREASE THE PH A REDUCE THE EXPOSURE ARE TOO ACIDIC WATERS BY ORGANISMS ARE BETTER LIVING WITHIN THE SEAGRASS BETTER THE KELP FORESTS DEPENDING ON WHICH SYSTEM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND POTENTIAL. FOR. ORGANISMS NEARBY POTENTIALLY TO BENEFIT AS WELL. SO I. THE SEQUESTRATION PIECE REFERS TO. LONGER TERM PROCESS SEES WHERE AND. THE C. GROUSE AND THE KELP MAY SERVE AS A NATURAL CARBON SINK STORING CARBON POTENTIALLY FOR DECADES TO MILLENNIA AND THESE ARE THROUGH PROPHECIES OF BURIAL AND TRANSPORT. WITHIN THE KELP FOREST. THE MAIN MECHANISM BY WHICH THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE TO SEQUESTRATION IS BY TRANSPORT OF THE CALPERS ACTUALLY INTO VERY DEEP SEA HABITATS AND GETS SORT OF STUCK THERE ARE FEW WELL. FOR LONG TERM. FOR THE. SEAGRASS BEDS THERE ARE COUPLE OF MECHANISMS BUT PRIMARILY IT'S BURIAL OF BIOMASS FROM THE SEA GRASS THEMSELVES POSSIBLY FROM PARTICULATE MATTER THE WAY THAT IT FILTERS DOWN INTO THE BEDS AND BURIAL IN THE SETTLEMENTS UNDERNEATH THE ROOTS AND AND THEIR. THE SUBSTRATE BY THE SEA GRASS ITSELF NEXT. SO THE KEY STATES US ARE THE KEY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STATE IS WORKING TO ADDRESS. ARE ARE THESE DO USE THE SUBMERGED AQUATIC VEGETATION HABITATS. MEASURABLY LESSEN THE SEVERITY OF OCEAN ACIDIFICATION EXPOSURE. AND IF THEY DO WHEN AND WHERE AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS I DID THESE HABITATS BEST PERFORM THIS FUNCTION OF AMELIORATING. THE ACIDITY OF THE WATER. AND CAN THE SUBMERGED AQUATIC VEGETATION HABITATS BE MANAGED IN A WAY THAT ACTUALLY REDUCES THE ENVIRONMENTAL STRAUSS OF OCEAN ACIDIFICATION ON THE SPECIES THAT WE HAVE ALONG THE WEST COAST. TOWARD THAT END THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL SCIENCE ADVISORY TEAM CONVENED A WORKING GROUP. AND WORKING WITH OCEAN SIGNED TRUST ON BEHALF OF A PC AND CALIFORNIA MANAGERS. WE WERE CHARGED WITH COMMUNICATING. THE EMERGING SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING SUMMARIZING KNOWLEDGE GAPS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR FILLING THEM THROUGH RESEARCH AND MONITORING AND TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON NEXT STEPS SO OF THIS WAS THAT WORKING GROUP THAT GOT CONVENIENT. AND JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE DIVERSITY OF EXPERTISE THAT WAS BROUGHT TO BEAR ON IT. THERE WERE TEN RESEARCH SCIENTISTS THREE OF THEM ARE MEMBERS OF THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL SCIENCE ADVISORY TEAM THEMSELVES THERE WERE SEVEN UNIVERSITIES. ARE REPRESENTED INCLUDING SEVEN FOLKS FROM UNIVERSITIES EXCUSE ME FROM THE CSU THE UC SYSTEM IN OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY ONE OF THE SCIENTISTS WAS FROM A RESEARCH INSTITUTE THE. MONTEREY BAY AQUARIUM RESEARCH INSTITUTE ONE WAS A CALIFORNIA SEA GRANT EXTENSIONS SPELL SPECIALIST. THEY WERE SUPPORTED BY THREE SCIENTIFIC STOP FROM THE OCEAN SCIENCE TRUST AND WE CAN BE IN A WORKSHOP. WHICH INCLUDED ADDITIONAL. OF FOLKS TO MAKE THE SCIENCE REAL A FEW WELL CONNECTED TO FOR POLICYMAKERS MANAGERS FROM CALIFORNIA AND AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. OPC STAFF OF IS TO STAFF BUT TO FOLKS FROM NGOS AM I WON ADDITIONAL SCIENTIFIC EXPERT WHO WAS NOT A MEMBER OF THE WORKING GROUP. THE FINDINGS ARE NOW AVAILABLE THAT CAME OUT THEY WERE RELEASED JANUARY THIRTIETH SO YOU CAN. BEGIN TO THE DETAILS THERE. NICE. BOOKLET AND. WITHOUT I'M GOING TO. I THINK THE NEXT SLIDE IS YOU I'M GONNA PASS ON TO MY COLLEAGUE AND CO CHAIR OF THAT WORKING GROUP. J. STOCKTWITS FROM UC DAVIS. GREAT THANK YOU KARINA AND THANKS CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. I THINK WHAT I'D LIKE TO START WITH IS JUST HERE ARE SOME OF THE. ORGANISMS THAT YOU'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT HERE THE PLANTS THAT ARE DOING THE WORK. MOSTLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUR GRASS WERE TALKING ABOUT ZOSTER MARINA AT STATEWIDE OCCURS FROM FROM BORDER TO BORDER. THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER SPECIES CALLED ZOSTER PACIFICA WHICH LOOKS VERY SIMILAR AND IT'S A BIT BIGGER BUT YOU'LL FIND IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HELP THERE'S MOSTLY TWO SPECIES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE GIANT KELP. WHICH IS PUBLIC THE ONE EVERYBODY'S MOST FAMILIAR WITH THAT'S MOSTLY IN THEIR CENTRAL THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THEN THE BULL KELP. WHICH IS MOSTLY CENTRAL TO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SO THOSE ARE MOST OR TALK ONLY SAKE HELP. THAT'S A PICTURE OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT YOUR GRASS ITS BIT USUALLY ZOSTER MARINA BUT IT MAY BE EITHER OF THOSE. OKAY SO HERE'S WHAT WE'RE SORT OF HERE FOR RIGHT. THERE ARE THESE AT THE KEY FINDINGS SO THE FIRST ONE IS A YES OKAY WE CAN SAY THAT YES. SERVERS AQUATIC VEGETATION CAN LOCALLY INCREASE THE WATER PH BY THE MECHANISMS THAT KARINA WAS ALLUDING TO. THEY TAKE UP CARBON DIOXIDE AND REDUCE THE P. H. AS A RESULT OF THAT. COURSE THE BIG QUESTIONS IS WHERE HOW MUCH AND AND AND AND WHAT IS IT YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE ULTIMATE EFFECT OF THAT WE KNOW THINGS LIKE THE LONGER THE WATER STAYS IN THAT. SEAGRASS BETTER KELP FOREST THE GREATER THE EFFECT. WE KNOW THAT THE GREATER THE PHOTO SYNTHETIC RATE THE GREATER THE EFFECT. BUT CUT PIECING ALL THOSE TOGETHER INTO EXACTLY A PICTURE OF WHERE AND WHEN THE AFFECTS OUR GREATEST IS WHERE WERE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW. GOOD NEXT SIDE. SO HOW BIG IS THAT AFFECT THAT'S WHAT WE'D ALL LIKE TO KNOW. AND. THE THE FIRST MESSAGE TO SORT OF GET ACROSS FROM THIS IS THAT OF COURSE YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD ANY SCIENTIST TELLS YOU WELL IT DEPENDS. IT VARIES. AND AND IT DOES BUT I'M GONNA TRY TO TELL YOU LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT IT DEPENDS ON AND OF COURSE IF YOU KNOW THAT. FROM WHAT KARINA TOLD YOU THAT FOR THE SYNTHESIS DEPENDS ON LIKE YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA VERY TO THE COURSE OF THE DAY RIGHT DURING THE DAY WHEN THE PLANTS ARE ACTIVELY GROWING IN TAKING UP CARBON DIOXIDE. THE P. H. WILL GO UP AS THE CO TWO IS USED AT NIGHT WHEN THE PLANT STOP VOTER SYNTHESIZING AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY RESPIRE IN MORE POOR OR PUTTING OUT CARBON DIOXIDE THE P. H. MAY GO DOWN SO YOU CAN SEE THERE. ON THIS. ON ON THIS GRAPH I HOPE THIS WILL REACH APPEAR NOT BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT THE. THE THE VARIATION INSIDE A SEAGRASS BED MIGHT BE PART EXPECTED TO BE LARGER THEN THE VARIATION OUTSIDE SEACREST BUT NO THE WORDS. THE HIGHS ARE HIGHER IN THE LOW'S ARE LOWER INSIDE THAT INSIDE THAT SUBMERGED AQUATIC VEGETATION THAT GOT. RIGHT SO THAT'S THOSE ARE BASICALLY THAT YOU KNOW SHOWING THAT GAP. AND. DOCTORS HILL AND. NICHOLS WILL BE TELLING YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THIS VARIATION LATER ON WHEN THEY PRESENT THE RESULTS OF SOME OF THEIR OPC FUNDED FUNDED WORK. NEXT THING THAT WE ARE OF COURSE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT AS WE DON'T JUST WANT TO KNOW ABOUT. P. H. FOR PIZZA SAKE BUT WHAT AFFECT DOES IT ACTUALLY HAVE ON THE PLANTS AND ANIMALS THAT ARE LIVING IN SEAGRASSES WHAT'S THE REAL BY OFFERING AFFECT NOT FROM A CHEMICAL PERSPECTIVE FROM A BIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE. SO FOR EXAMPLE MOST OF WHAT WE KNOW. IS. HOW DOES SOMETHING LIKE AN OYSTER GROW MORE OR LESS WHEN WE CHANGE THE AVERAGE P. H.? RIGHT SO YOU CAN SEE THE AVERAGE INSIDE THE BAD IS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE OUTSIDE THE BED. SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN OKAY WE CAN TEST THAT'S MOSTLY WHAT WE'VE DONE SO FAR. BUT WHAT IF WHAT REALLY MATTERS IS THE HIGHS GO AHEAD. RIGHT WHAT IF THAT GOT MORE MORE SO WHAT IF THE MAXIMUM IS WHAT MATTERS RIGHT OR WHAT IF THE MINIMUM IS WHAT REALLY MATTERS. AND YOU CAN THINK ABOUT THIS A FEW YOU KNOW HAD ANY SORT OF INCLINATION TO GROW PLANTS OR A GARDEN WHAT USUALLY LIMITS PLANTS GROWING PLANTS HERE LOCALLY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. IS OFTEN LOW TEMPERATURES IN THE WINTER RIGHT WE CAN'T GROW A LOT OF TROPICAL THINGS HERE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T WITHSTAND FREEZING. AND YOU MIGHT THINK THAT'S SORT OF THE ANALOGOUS THING MIGHT GO ON IN OUR AND OUR GRASS BEDS IN OTHER WORDS IT MIGHT NOT BE THE AVERAGE CONDITION THAT MATTER SO MUCH. BUT IT MIGHT BE DOES IT REALLY YOU KNOW IF THESE OYSTERS ARE ARE ARE LAYING DOWN SHALL DURING THE DAY THAN THAT HUGE BENEFIT DURING THE DAY MIGHT BE A REALLY BIG DEAL. RIGHT SO SO WE TO THINK NOT JUST ABOUT BUTTON THE MEAN CHANGES. BUT THE AVERAGE CHANGE. AND WHAT THOSE DO BIOLOGICALLY. BUT NEXT LIKE. SO I'M I KNOW ONE ECHO SOMETHING THAT THAT MARY SAID EARLIER AND THAT IS THAT. THE THE GOOD NEWS HERE IS THAT WE ALREADY NOW THAT SEAGRASSES IN CULTS DO A LOT OF GOOD THINGS FOR ECOSYSTEMS AND AND FOR HUMANS WHETHER IT'S PROVIDING HABITAT. FISHES FOR CRABS FOR LOBSTERS BOTH COMMERCIALLY AND RECREATIONAL IMPORTANT FISHERIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA OR WHETHER IT'S TRACKING DOWN THE SORT OF COASTAL EROSION PROTECTION THINGS THAT MARY TOLD THE SIR. ARE GOING ON IT WE ALREADY KNOW HAPPENING IN SOME SEA GRASS BEDS WE KNOW THERE ARE A BUNCH OF THINGS THAT THE SEA GRASSES AND CELTS ALREADY DO. AND SO THEN THE QUESTION IS WHAT ELSE DID THEY DO WHAT ADDITIONAL BENEFIT CAN WE GET IN TERMS OF AWAY WHILE DOING ALL THESE THINGS THAT WE ALREADY KNOW OUR BIG POSITIVE I'M FROM THE SWORDS AQUATIC VEGETATION. SO LET ME. TAKE A SECOND TO JUST INTRODUCE OUR OUR NEXT GROUP JUST SO YOU KNOW HOW THEY'RE GONNA FIT INTO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TESSA HILL. ABDUCTOR TESSA HILL GONNA LEAD US OFF. AND AND SHE HAS BEEN DOING WORK. ASSOCIATE WITH THE O. P. C.. THAT ASKS THE QUESTIONS ABOUT WELL WHAT LOCATIONS FOR EELGRASS SHOWED THE MOST PROMISE. ARE THERE SOME PLACES WHERE THE EFFECTS ARE GREATER OR LOWER. YOU KNOW WHAT CAN WE WHAT WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THAT SO FAR. AND THEN SHE'LL BE FOLLOWED BY SIR NEWKIRK FROM THE NATURE CONSERVANCY WHO WILL BE TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW WE OFTEN THINK ABOUT HOW SEAGRASS MIGHT COMPETE WITH OTHER SORTS OF USES IN IN COASTAL SYSTEMS. LIKE AQUACULTURE BUT IF SEAGRASSES INCREASE. PH THERE MIGHT ALSO BE BENEFITS TO AQUACULTURE OTHER SORTS OF OPERATIONS AND SHE'S GONNA TALK ABOUT BALANCING THOSE THOSE NEEDS. AND AND OUR OUR LAST SPEAKER WILL BE CARRY NICHOLS DOCTOR CHEMICALS AND CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE WHO WILL BE FOR SHIFTING THE FOCUS FROM EELGRASS TO THINKING ABOUT HELPS. AND WE KNOW FROM FOR EXAMPLE WHAT MARY SHOWED US THAT HELPS ARE DECLINING THROUGHOUT. A LARGE PART OF CALIFORNIA AND CARRIES WORK ON THE EFFECTS OF KELP ON. OCEAN ACIDIFICATION AND AND P. H. WILL TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT THE IMPACTS OF THAT MIGHT BE IN TERMS OF OF AFTER SHELF FORMING ORGANISMS. SO THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL BE SEEING IN THE SECOND PANEL AND I THINK AT THAT POINT THAT'S THAT'S IT FROM OUR PANEL AND. WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE IF THERE ARE ANY OKAY GOOD THANK YOU YEAH I DO HAVE SOME AND I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT. OTHER MEMBERS HERE. ARE ALSO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO ASK AND I'M GLAD MAYOR WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE INTERTIDAL AND THE. THE TITLE AREAS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE IN OUR PLANNING HOW WE DEAL WITH THINGS IS WE TEND TO DO. LAND BASED PLANNING OCEAN PLANNING COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM EACH OTHER AND FROM THIS. SO FAR EVEN IN THIS DISCUSSION IS VERY VERY CLEAR THAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WE HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT SMARTER ABOUT THOSE THINGS. AND THE. THE FRESHWATER CHALLENGES THAT YOU BROUGHT UP WITH THE THE FLUSH OF FRESH WATER GOING INTO THE SAME CISCO BANG. THOSE AS TO OUR SYSTEMS ARE OUR NATURAL BUFFERS AND WE HAVE TAKEN AWAY OVER TIME. THE ABILITY FOR THOSE BUFFERS TO REACT AND DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO THERE'D BEEN TIMES IN THE PAST WHERE THERE PROBABLY WAS. PLENTY VIA GRASSES AND CISCO BAY CLEARED OUT BECAUSE OF. LOTS OF RAIN EVENT IN THE WINTERTIME BUT THEN IT WAS ABLE TO RECOVER. SO FOR US THIS WHEN THE CHALLENGES RE ESTABLISHING SOME OF THOSE NATURAL SYSTEMS TO THE BEST WAY. THAT WE. THAT WE POSSIBLY CAN BUT MS HUBS I TUCKED BUT YOU MENTIONED AND SECTARIAN BLARED MENTION SO BRIEFLY THIS INTERNATIONAL WORKING GROUP GROUP. WHICH HAS. QUITE AN INTERESTING GROUP OF COUNTRIES WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN ANY AND I JUST HAVE TO POINT OUT OF COURSE CALIFORNIA. IS REPRESENTING. THAT THE UNITED STATES SEEMS TO BE REPRESENTING BUT CALIFORNIA IS WE'RE STEPPING IN FOR THAT NATIONAL EVEN THOUGH WE'RE SUB NATIONAL JURISDICTION. WHAT'S WHAT EXPECTATIONS WHAT'S THE PLAN WITH A PROCESS FOR THAT INTERNATIONAL WORKING GROUP CEO AND THE INTERNATIONAL WORKING GROUP IS EN A COLLABORATION OF SUBNATIONAL GROUPS ACADEMIC GROUPS NGOS. AND TRIBES. PRETTY MUCH AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO RAISE AWARENESS OF THE ISSUE OF OCEAN ACIDIFICATION INTERNATIONALLY. AND THEN TAKE CONCRETE STEPS TO ADDRESS A PROBLEM SO EACH JURISDICTION THAT JOINS THE ALLIANCE IS SUPPOSED TO DEVELOP AN ACTION PLAN THAT LAYS OUT WHAT STEPS THEY'RE GONNA TAKE. AT THEIR INDIVIDUAL LEVEL DID TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS OF CALIFORNIA AND IS IN THE PROCESS NOW OF DEVELOPING OUR ACTION PLAN WE JUST LAST WEEK FUNDED. O. S. T. TO HELP US DEVELOP THE COMMUNICATION AND MATERIALS AND OUTREACH AND DEVELOP KIND OF THE PLAN THAT WE'RE GONNA BE MAKING WERE WORKING WITH A GROUP OF SCIENTISTS. AND SOME OF THE SAME SCIENTISTS WHO HELPED DEVELOP THE AS. THE SCIENCE PANEL AND THEN A COUPLE OF ADDITIONAL SCIENTISTS WHO WERE ON BOARD TO HELP ANSWER. WHATEVER SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS AND WE NEED WHATEVER KIND OF. APPROACH WE NEED TO DEVELOP IT TO HELP CALIFORNIA MOVE FORWARD IN ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM. AND. JEFF THANK YOU DAY AND AND THANK FOR THAT THAT THAT WAS. I WANT TO MAKE SURE WAS EXPLAINED BECAUSE NOT ONLY. ARE WE DOING THIS BECAUSE OF. SOME OF THE LEGISLATION AND INTEREST IN THE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS IN ADDRESSING THIS BUT ALSO THE CONTEXT OF. THESE INTERNATIONAL. AGREEMENTS INTERNATIONAL. COORDINATION THAT'S GOING ON SO WE'RE DOING AN ACTION PLAN OTHER COUNTRIES ARE DOING ACTION PLANS. AND. THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE WE'RE GONNA OF ASSAULT BY OURSELVES NOBODY'S GONNA HAFTA LOOK AT THAT. GLOBAL IMPACT AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF THE WEST COAST OCEAN ACIDIFICATION PANEL IS THAT IT WAS THAT A COLLABORATION AMONG CALIFORNIA WASHINGTON OREGON AND BRITISH COLUMBIA. AND THERE'S REAL STRENGTH THERE AND SHOWING AND THE IMPACTS TO THE ENTIRE WEST COAST AND THAT WHEN NONE OF US ARE NOT ALLOWED WE'RE ALL GONNA NEED TO WORK TOGETHER WE HAVE ON OUR SCIENCE PANEL. A SCIENTIST FROM OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY SO WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THE. THE BRASS OF THE PROBLEM IN THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM BUT AT THE SAME TIME LOCALIZE OUR ACTIONS TO MAKE A MEANINGFUL. OKAY AND AND ONE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF BRINGING SCIENCE INTO THE LEGISLATURE IS OF COURSE OUR DESIROUS TO OKAY WOULD WE DID WHAT WE HAD WAS ON PACIFIC LET'S GO. AND GET THE SCIENCE IS DEVELOPING WHICH I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR FROM HERE AND I DON'T. I HOPE YOU'RE THEIR APPROPRIATE FOLKS ASK OR THAT NECESSARILY THE NEXT PANEL BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE LEARNED ALONG THE WAY. ABOUT THAT'S BEEN DEVELOPING AN UNDERSTANDING THE ELKHORN SLOUGH ABOUT SOME OF THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SEA OTTERS. EEL GRASS AND HOW NECESSARY THEY THEY ARE FOR EACH OTHER. LEADS US TO. START TO LOOK AT BETTER THE SYSTEMS AND ASSUMING THIS IS ALL A PART OF IT I THINK THERE WAS A BRIEF MENTION IN THERE ABOUT SOME OF THE SPECIES AND. AND OTHER. IMPACTS AND IN INFLUENCES ON THIS BECAUSE IF WE ARE GOING TO PLAY REPLANT EELGRASS. IF WE DO THAT WITHOUT AN UNDERSTANDING OF ECOSYSTEMS IN THE DANCE IS EXCESSIVE INCLUDING OTHER SPECIES. THAT WE'RE JUST PLAN SAYING HAVE IT REMOVED PLANS A HAVING REMOVED OR NOT GETTING ANYWHERE. ALIKE DUMPING SAND ON BEACHES. BUT THAT'S A DIFFERENT ISSUE. AND AND SO THAT THAT I'M ASSUMING IS A CONTEXT FOR ALL OF HIS HOUSE HOW. ARE ALL OF THOSE STUDIES GOING INTERLACE IN ORDER FOR US TO UNDERSTAND. POLICIES THAT WE COULD BE WORKING ON HELPING TO PROVIDE AS WELL AS OF COURSE FUNDING I DID NOTE THAT THAT WAS DEFINITELY A BUDGET IN THERE AND. THAT'S SOMETHING WE'LL HAVE TO WORK OUT BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION MAKE SURE THAT WE TAKE ALL THIS SERIOUSLY AND FUNDING AT AND SECRETARY LEAD WAS CORRECT. THAT. THE. GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS HAD BEEN VERY VERY NARROWLY CONSTRUED NOW I THINK WE CAN START TO SEE HOW THEY CAN BENEFIT THE ADAPTATION CONVERSATION. THESE KINDS OF PROJECTS AS OPPOSED JUST PURELY MITIGATION ALTHOUGH WHAT WE TALK ABOUT REALLY ENCOMPASSES. BOTH SO THAT THAT BROADER CONTEXT SPECIES EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT HOW THESE SYSTEMS INTERACT YEAH BUT IT. I BE HAPPY TO SAY A FEW WORDS. WE ARE OBVIOUSLY VERY COGNIZANT. IN IN SOME WAYS WHEN WE PRESENT THIS SNAPSHOT IF YOU WILL OF WHAT WE'RE FINDING AND WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING A BIT ON THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL ASPECTS OF IT MORE THAN THE BIOLOGICAL. BUT I WOULD SAY THAT IT'S ALL OF US GOING TO SOME VERY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HOW WHERE WHEN AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES IT'S ABOUT EMBEDDING ALL OUR OTHER KNOWLEDGE OF HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS AND YOU'RE RIGHT SOMETIMES A SPECIES THAT ARE IN THE SYSTEM. CAN IMPACT THE EFFICACY. OF THESE RESPONSES SO YES I THINK WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING IS THAT THE SYNTHETIC. SUMMARY CONCLUSIONS THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW BUT WE HAD ARE VERY COGNIZANT OF ALL THOSE OTHER PLAYERS. IF THAT HELPS A LITTLE BIT AND I AND I THINK WE'RE DOING SOMETHING RIGHT IF YOU'RE ASKING US THAT QUESTION. WELL ANYTHING AND I KNOW IN CONTEXT THAT THAT IS BEING CONSIDERED BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE'RE REMINDING OURSELVES OF THIS WOULD WHERE WE ARE. IN THE INVESTIGATION. HOW REALLY NICE AND A LOT OF THIS IS IN IN OUR UNDERSTANDING AND? SO COMING UP WITH SOLUTIONS NEED TO BE THOUGHTFUL AND WELL FRAME. BASED ON THE SCIENCE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THEIR YOU KNOW THERE ARE POTENTIAL TIPPING POINTS THAT WE MAY BE COMING CLOSER TO SO. THIS JUST THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS JUST PART OF THE FRAMEWORK OF THINKING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND HOW IT'S IMPACTING ECOSYSTEMS. WE UNDERSTAND A FAIR AMOUNT BUT THEN THERE IS STILL THIS GREAT UNCERTAINTY MAYBE JAY WITH I HAVE LIKE MAYBE JUST JUST HAVE TO TRY TO. YOU KNOW GO BACK TO TEAR YOUR QUESTION THEY'RE SORT OF LONG THEN I THINK. YOU KNOW IT WITHOUT A BORING YOU WITH THE ARCANE NATURE OF IT TO SORT OF GROUPS OF SCIENTISTS INTERESTED IN YOUR GRASS. THERE BEEN PLANT PEOPLE AND THEY'RE BEEN ANIMAL PEOPLE RIGHT SO. AND ALL PEOPLE DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT HOW THE PLANTS WORK AS LONG AS THEY'RE THERE AND PROVIDE PLACE FOR THE ANIMALS TO LIVE. AND. THE YOU KNOW THE PLAN PEOPLE DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT THE ANIMALS BECAUSE IT'S LIKE I JUST LIKE PLANTS RIGHT. SO BUT NOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT AWAY IS ACTUALLY DOING IS IT'S BRINGING THOSE GROUPS TOGETHER. BECAUSE THERE THE CONNECTIONS ARE EVEN MORE OBVIOUS NOW THAN THEY'VE EVER BAD WHERE. NOT ONLY IS IT JUST THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE OF THAT PLANT BUT IT'S HOW IT'S CHANGING THE CHEMISTRY OF THE WATER THAT AFFECTS THE ANIMALS THEIR. ABILITY TO LAY DOWN SHELVE THEIR BEHAVIOR AS. YOU KNOW AS AS IN SELECTING HABITATS IN THERE IT WHETHER THEY EVEN COME THERE TO BEGIN WITH. AND AND SO I GUESS I'M I'M SORT OF HOPEFUL THAT SOME OF THE EFFORTS THAT BY THAT OP SEE IN BOTH THE OTHER AWAY HYPOXIA GROUP AND IN OUR ARE WORKING GROUP IT'S ARE DONE. IS TO BRING TOGETHER SOME SCIENTISTS WHO ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN SORT OF MESHING THOSE TWO PERSPECTIVES TOGETHER. AND AND I GUESS WHAT YOU KNOW. MY PERSPECTIVE NOW IS THERE'S PRETTY MUCH NO WAY TO THINK ABOUT ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER IN OTHER WORDS THERE'S JUST. YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT PLANT PHYSIOLOGY OF SEA GRASS THAT'S GREAT I MIGHT LOVE THAT BUT THERE'S PRETTY MUCH NO WAY TO THINK ABOUT THAT WITHOUT THE ANIMALS FOR LOTS OF REASONS. AND VICE VERSA SO SO I I REALLY THINK THAT THAT EVEN THE SCIENCE SIDE OF THINGS HAS THAT SEPARATION THAT YOU'RE SORT OF HINTING AT. BUT IT'S IT'S COMING TOGETHER. AS A RESULT OF THIS AND I THINK THAT I THINK THAT YOU KNOW YOU'LL SEE MORE OF THAT FROM. FROM THE SCIENCE WERE GOING FORWARD. IT AND A GOOD POINT IF WE'RE GONNA BE DOING POLICY WE WE'VE GOT. TO BRING A LOT OF THAT TOGETHER JUST LOOKING AT YOUR GRAPHICS OF THE KELP FOREST COVER. MANY START. AND IF WE'RE GOING TO BE RELYING ON CAL EELGRASS IN ORDER TO HELP AMELIORATE THE FACTS OF. THAT THE PH CHANGES IN THE OCEAN IF WE DON'T HAVE THOSE CUP FOREST AGGRESSIVE BETS THAN. THIS IS NICE BUT NOT GOING TO REALLY GET AS. ANYWHERE AND AS WE STAND IN OTHER CONVERSATIONS AS WE TALK ABOUT. AQUACULTURE AND EVEN THEIR NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES OVER THE YEARS TO TO LOOK AT ALGAE'S EDIBLE ALGAE'S IN THE OCEAN AS PARTY AQUACULTURE. LET ALONE SOME THE SHELLFISH WHICH ALSO FILTER THE WATER AND HAVE AND HAVE OTHER BENEFITS TO IT. BUT A A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY. COULD FACILITATE AND. ENTIRE ECONOMIC INDUSTRY AROUND APPROPRIATELY DONE. AQUACULTURE BUT ALSO RESTORING THAT THE BULK OF THE NATURAL. SYSTEMS THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT HELP THE ILL GRASS SAID AND THE WAY THAT THESE THESE ESTUARIES WORK BECAUSE THEY YES WHERE YOU ALSO ARE A PHYSICAL. BUFFER TO THE CHANGES THE WATER FLOWS IN SEES RISING IN SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE THAT ARE OUT THERE AND. WE'VE TAKEN THOSE SYSTEMS REGRET% FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME AND. AS WE HEAR. THAT ONE THING I JUST WANTED TO ADD TO THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE OPC ISRAELI AN ECOSYSTEM BASED ORGANIZATION WERE SUPPOSED TO BE THINKING ABOUT. THE HEALTH OF THE ENTIRE OCEAN ECOSYSTEM AND NOT JUST A SPECIES BY SPECIES KIND OF APPROACH AND. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. FOR SB WILLING TO EXPERIMENT AND SEE BE BOLD AND TO THE INNOVATIVE AND THAT MAY MEAN THAT WE FUND SOME PROJECTS THAT FAIL. AND AND THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT IN THE CONTEXT OF SEA GRASS AND CAL BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T KNOW. AND BUT. IF WE WANT TO DO IT SECRETARY LAIRD WAS SAYING AND MOVE THE SCIENCE FOR IT BEFORE THE END OF HIS NATURAL LIFE WE REMAIN NEEDS YOU. TO TAKE SOME THINGS ON FASTER THAN WE WOULD OTHERWISE FEEL COMFORTABLE DOING AND SO I THINK THAT THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF. SOME OF THE FUNDING REQUEST IS CAN WE DO A PILOT PROJECT HERE CAN LEAD TO A DEMONSTRATION PROJECT. IN ORDER TO TEST THESE THEORIES TO THEN BE ABLE TO SCALE THEM UP. AND I SAID THAT'S EXACTLY THE POINT I WAS GOING TO MAKE AND I THINK I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT. WE BE MORE NIMBLE AND THAT WE TAKE MORE RISKS. AND STE YOU KNOW AS JAY SAID WE WE KNOW THAT RESTORATION OF THESE HABITATS IS IT IS A NO REGRET STRATEGY. BUT IF WE'RE ABLE TO DO IT IN A SORT OF EXPERIMENTAL CONTEXT ARE ARE PROJECTS IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY BECAUSE SAN FRANCISCO'S STATE IS. REALLY AT. MORE THAN PARTNER IN IT ANOTHER CO DIRECTING THE SCIENCE PIECE OF THAT WERE ABLE TO BE COLLECTING A LOT OF INFORMATION AND LEARNING AND I THINK YOU KNOW THAT REYES RIGHT WE'RE GONNA HOUSE TO. BE WILLING TO FAIL BE WILLING TO DO MORE EXPERIMENTAL KINDS OF PROJECTS. AND YOU KNOW. RELATIVELY CONFIDENT THAT THAT IF WE RESTORE THESE HABITATS EVEN FOR A LITTLE WHILE THERE'S SOME BENEFIT THERE. AND BUT IF IT ALSO ADVANCES OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT'S THAT'S WORTHWHILE TO AND AS. AS WE SEE MORE CLIMATIC VARIABILITY WE NEED TO BE MORE NIMBLE AND IN HOW WE RESPOND. IT AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT OF COURSE WERE THE LEGISLATURE AND NOTHING WE DO HERE EVER VANNATTER WE'RE NOT USED TO THAT. BUT. THE IT IN AND. THIS IS KIND OF WHY I THINK I'M EXCITED BY THIS CONVERSATION AND SOME OF. THE ABILITY TO TO LOOK AHEAD BECAUSE IF THE SCIENCE IS THERE AND THE SCIENCES SAW. THEN WHATEVER THE RESULT OF AN INDIVIDUAL PROJECT. AS LONG AS IT FITS INTO A A LARGER. PLAN AND PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO THEN BY DEFINITION IT'S REALLY NOT A FAILURE. YET THE ALL THOSE PAINTINGS HAVE SCHOOL BAY CASE IN POINT YES THEY WERE PLANTING YOU CAN SEE WHERE SOME OF THE U. GRASS WAS WORKING. THEN A HUGE RAIN VERY VERY WET WINTER COMES CHANGES THE SALINITY OF THE BAY CHANGES ALL OF THAT. WHAT WE'VE LEARNED SOMETHING AND ONE OF THINGS WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THOSE SYSTEMS ARE COVER WHETHER THEY NEED OUR ASSISTANCE OR WHETHER WE CAN PUT ENOUGH IN PLACE? BETTER WILL START TO WORK THE WAY IT WOULD HAVE WORKED. COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. BEFORE WE HAD HARDENED THE BAY AND REALLY CHANGE THOUGH SYSTEMS IRREPARABLY. AND THAT'S THAT'S THE VALUE BECAUSE I WOULD HATE TO SEE US. DO LIKE MY COMMENT THE WORKING VERY WELL. MAY BE THAT WAS A GOOD THING TO UNDERSTAND BUT IF WE'RE RELYING ON A PROJECT TO BE THE FINAL SOLUTION FOR A MITIGATION. THAT'S A LITTLE SCARY BUT IF WE HAVE A BROADER PLAN. THAT IS SCIENCE BASED ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING THEN WE HAVE SOME ABILITY FOR SOME SUCCESS IN FOR SOME LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES AS. AS WE MOVE THROUGH AND THAT SHOULD BE A PART BE ABLE TO BE A PART OF THE OVERALL STRATEGY. I WOULD HOPE. SO IT WOULD JUST ACCURATE REMARK ON THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY EXAMPLE. BECAUSE ONE OF MY A SCIENTISTS WORKING ON THAT PROJECT AND SHE WAS VERY. IT IS WAS CONCERNED AFTER THE RAINS AND THAT WE HAVE SEEN SOME. FREE SPROUTING AND. NATURAL. GROWTH COMING OUT AND THAT'S VERY EXCITING THAT'S VERY IT DOES SEEM TO BE RECOVERING BUT WE'RE LEARNING WHERE IT RECOVERS BOUNCED WHICH PLACES MAY BE. ESSENTIAL REFUGIO THAT WILL THEN SERVICE SOURCE MATERIAL FOR. RECOVERY IN OTHER PLACES SO I'D SAY THAT THAT SPATIAL MOSAIC AND THOUGH THE MONITORING THAT WE'RE DOING IS REALLY INFORMING US ON THE GROUND. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AFTER AN EVENT LIKE THAT WHICH PLACES ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT? AND HOW TO HOW DO WE GO FROM THERE EVEN GIVEN THE INCREASED. VARIABILITY AND BEING ON THE FRONT LINES. AND THEN AT LEAST RIGHT BACK TO THE. THE FANA DISCUSSION BECAUSE IN SOME THE ZEAL BAD EELGRASS BEDS THOUGH CRAP POPULATION CAN TAKE THE ALGAE OFF WHICH HARMS THEM THAT'S WHERE THE ORDERS CAME IN OUR. EATING THE CRABS NOW ORDERS ARE FLOURISHING YOUR GRASS CAN FLOURISH THOSE CONNECTIONS HELP WAS. LEAD TO THE RECOVERY AND WITHOUT ONE PIECE IN THERE IF WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THEN WE'LL BE SCRATCHING OUR HEADS ABOUT WHY IT'S NOT RECOVERING IN THE WAY WE THOUGHT HE WOULD EXPECT. OKAY. THANK YOU BRING UP KANSEN THANK YOU DATA WILL WILL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL. SO FOR LOCAL PERSPECTIVES AND SOME OF THOSE PROJECTS. PROFESSOR AND THIS NEW CAR CLASS. I SAW YOU WE WERE PADDLING ON THE ELKHORN SLOUGH. THEN AROUND SOME OF THOSE ADDED VOTE HERE HE FIFTH. YEAH WITH THE EEL GRASS BEDS IN THAT. AND THE ORDERS AND ALL. OKAY LISA ACTUALLY BEGIN CAN NOT FIRST I JUST WANNA THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT ON THIS ISSUE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS AS WELL AS THE REST OF THE SWAT COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I WAS THE OTHER THING THAT I REALLY WANT TO SAY WHICH IS THAT CLEARLY A TAKE HOME MESSAGE FROM TODAY IS THAT. EFFORTS TOWARDS RESTORATION AND CONSERVATION OF SEAGRASSES ARE DEFINITELY รณ A WIN WIN SITUATION AND THIS HAS BEEN RE ITERATED BY SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE ALREADY. SO I WILL JUST. ADD MY VOTE TO THAT STATEMENT THAT THERE ARE SO MANY GOOD REASONS TO RESTORE AND CONSERVE THESE HABITATS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND WHEN WE ADD OCEAN ACIDIFICATION OR CARBON SEQUESTRATION ON TOP OF THEM THAT'S JUST SORT OF AN EXTRA YOU KNOW BONUS REASON. WHAT I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU ABOUT? ARE SOME CURRENT PROJECTS THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL. THAT SPAN THE ENTIRE STATE. THESE PROJECTS IN LARGE PART WERE INSPIRED BY INITIAL WORK THAT WAS SUPPORTED BY CALIFORNIA SEAGRAM'S AND SO YOU'LL SORT OF HERO. ME SAY THIS A COUPLE TIMES THAT THESE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES ARE ACTUALLY QUITE IMPORTANT IN UNDERSTANDING QUESTIONS LIKE THIS. THE YELLOW DOTS ON THE MAP HERE TELL YOU PLACES THAT WORST CURRENTLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER SEAGRASS MEADOWS. CAN MODIFY EXTREME CHEMISTRY AND ALSO STORE CARBON SO WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND BOTH ASPECTS OF WHAT THE PREVIOUS PANEL DISCO. I'D LIKE TO BASICALLY TAKE A DEEP DIVE INTO TWO OF THESE SITES AND SO THE FIRST ONE IS THE HUMBOLDT OCEAN CARBON OBSERVATORY. THIS IS LED BY JOE TUBERS  <u><c.green>OF CALIFORNIA SEA</c></u> GRANT ON IN PARTNERSHIP WITH SCIENTISTS AT HUMBOLDT STATE UNIVERSITY AND UC DAVIS I'M ONE OF THOSE COLLABORATORS. THIS PROJECT ENCOMPASSES THREE DIFFERENT GOALS ALL WITHIN HUMBOLDT BAY AND SO THE FIRST RC REST SURVEYS WERE SCIENTISTS ARE GOING OUT REPEATEDLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE SEA GRASS. IS CHANGING SEASONALLY AND THROUGH TIME AND WERE GOING TO HEAR MORE FROM SARAH NEWKIRK NEXT ON SORT OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF HOW WE MIGHT MONITOR SEAGRASSES LIKE THAT. ANOTHER ASPECT OF THIS PROJECT IS ON A SIGNIFICANT UPGRADE TO OUR MONITORING SYSTEM IN THIS IN THE CAT IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION. UPGRADING OCEAN ACIDIFICATION MONITORING BOTH THAT TRINIDAD PIER AND WOOD IN HUMBOLDT BAY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH HOG ISLAND OYSTER COMPANY. THIS IS BUILDING UPON A FIVE YEAR PARTNERSHIP THAT OUR GROUP AT UC DAVIS HAS HAD WITH HOG ISLAND OYSTER COMPANY. WE DO MONITORING JUST LIKE THIS MOLLIS BAY WHERE IT'S ESSENTIALLY SORT OF A WEATHER STATION IN THE OCEAN WHERE WE ARE TRACKING THE PROCESS OF OCEAN ACIDIFICATION INSIDE OF THAT DAY. THROUGH TIME AND WE'VE NOW. THROUGH THE SOCIAL PROTECTION COUNCIL SUPPORT BEEN ABLE TO EXPAND AND PLACE THOSE WEATHER STATIONS I'M ON THE HUMBOLDT COAST AND WITHIN THE HUMBOLDT BAY. THIS IS ALSO THE STE SITES ARE SUPPORTED BY THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM SO AGAIN WE'RE SEEING SCIENCE THAT IS BEING SUPPORTED BY MULTIPLE DIFFERENT FEDERAL AND STATE PARTNERSHIPS. FINALLY THIS SITE INCLUDES MONITORING OF SEAGRASS CHEMISTRY BOTH WIN IT WOULD IN A SEA GRASS MEADOW AS WELL AS OUTSIDE WITH THE REST MEADOW. AND MONITORING OYSTER GROWTH SO GETTING AT THAT BIOLOGICAL RESPONSE TO CHANGE. AND THAT PEACE IS BASICALLY NESTED WITHIN A MUCH BIGGER STATEWIDE EFFORT THAT WE HAVE MADE. SO WE TELL YOU ABOUT THAT. SO THAT THAT HUMBOLDT PIECE IS PART OF. I'VE A EFFORT THAT WE'VE MADE TO TRACK THESE PROCESSES WITHIN SIX DIFFERENT ACTUARIES ACROSS THE STATE'S ABOUT A DOT A DOZEN DIFFERENT SEAGRASS MEADOWS ARE BEING STUDIED. IN EACH CASE WE PLAY SENSORS WITH IN THE SEAGRASS BAD AND OUTSIDE OF THE SEA GRASS BAD. OFTENTIMES NOT ALWAYS BUT OFTEN TIMES ALSO WITH OYSTERS. AND WERE BASICALLY TRACKING HOW THIS PROCESS OF OCEAN ACIDIFICATION IS AMELIORATED OR MODIFIED BY THE SEA GRASS ITSELF. WE'RE DOING THIS BOTH IN. NATURAL OR NATIVE SEAGRASS MEADOWS AS WELL AS SITES THAT HAVE BEEN TARGETS FOR RESTORATION SORE ALSO TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. WHICH OF THESE TYPES. RESTORED VERSES NATURAL MEADOWS MIGHT BE BETTER AT THIS PROCESS OR ARE THERE WAYS THAT WE COULD MAXIMIZE. THE BENEFIT FROM FROM THE SIMILARITY XIN. AGAIN I LIKE TO TAKE SORT OF A DEEP DIVE INTO ONE OF THESE SITES. AND NOT IS CYPRESS GROVE INTO MOLLIS BANG. THIS IS PROBABLY THE SITE WE KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THE BEST AT THIS POINT BECAUSE WE'VE REPEATEDLY MONITORED IT OVER A COUPLE OF YEARS NOW. AND. A PHD STUDENT. MELISSA WARD HAS ALSO BUILT A CO TWO FOX TOWER THAT ACTUALLY SITS ON SHORE. AND MEASURES THE CARBON DIOXIDE THAT'S GOING FROM THE AIR IN TO THE SEA WATER RIGHT ABOVE THE SEA RESPITE. SO AT THIS PARTICULAR SITE WE'RE TRACKING THE FULL PROCESS WERE WATCHING THE CEO TO GO INTO THE SEA WATER. WERE WATCHING HOW THAT CO TWO THEN MOVES THROUGH AND IS MODIFIED WITHIN THE SEAGRASS BED. WITH THOSE. SENSORS I TOLD YOU ABOUT AND WE'RE ALSO TAKING SEDIMENT CORES TO LOOK AT THE SETTLEMENTS. BELOW THE SEA GRASS BEDS SO AS PREVIOUS SPEAKERS HAVE MENTIONED JUST LIKE YOU CAN THINK ABOUT IN A FOREST WITH SOILS BELOW A FOREST THERE'S ACTUALLY A LOT OF CARBON. THAT ENDS UP STORED IN THOSE SOILS THE SAME THING HAPPENS IN A SEA GRASS BEDS AND SO THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT. OF CARBON ORGANIC MATTER THAT GETS TRAPPED THERE AND IS PROBABLY TRAPPED FOR DECADES TO CENTURIES AND WERE ACTUALLY TRYING TO QUANTIFY THAT PIECE AS WELL. SO WHEN WE JUST GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR FROM THIS SITE IN PARTICULAR. DURING THE SUMMER SEAGRASS MEADOWS CAN CHANGE THE WATER CHEMISTRY UP TO ABOUT POINT ONE P. H. UNIT. WHAT I MEAN BY SUMMER IS ESSENTIALLY THAT SEASON WHERE THE SEAGRASS MEADOWS ARE QUITE WASH FROM ABOUT MAY TO OCTOBER? TO MANY PEOPLE POINT ONE PITCH UNIT MIGHT SEEM SMALL. BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY THE SAME AMOUNT THAT OCEAN CHEMISTRY HAS CHANGED ALREADY DUE TO HUMAN IMPACTS TO THE ANTHROPOGENIC OCEANA CITIZENS URGED OSHA SUFFOCATION SIGNAL RIGHT NOW. IS ABOUT POINT ONE PH UNIT. SO IT'S DEFINITELY A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT THAT THOSE SEA GRASSES ARE HAVING. DURING THE SUMMER SO. THAT'S NOT THE CASE DURING THE WINTER AND WE'RE STILL TRYING TO EXPLORE SORT OF WHAT THAT MEANS. IN THE BIG PICTURE OVER AN ENTIRE YEAR WITH THAT MEANS. FOR THE NET IMPACT THE SEA GRASSES ARE HAVING. THE OTHER THING THAT WE SEE IS THAT SETTLEMENTS WITH IN THOSE SEA GRASS MEADOWS PARTICULARLY SMALLEST DAY HAVE UP TO ABOUT TWO TIMES MORE ORGANIC CARBON. THEN ON VEGETATED HABITATS THEY DON'T ALWAYS HAVE MORE BUT IN SOME CASES THEY DO AND SO NOW THE NEXT STEP IS FOR US TO IDENTIFY. WHAT ARE THE CHARACTERISTICS THAT MAKE IT SO THAT SEE GRASS BEDS ACTUALLY CAN STORE THAT CARBON FOR DECADES TO CENTURIES ARE THERE PARTICULAR MEADOWS THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD TARGET FOR RESTORATION OR CONSERVATION? THAT IF WE CAN IDENTIFY THOSE CHARACTERISTICS THAT OPTIMIZE THIS PROCESS. AS I WRAP UP HERE I JUST WANT TO SORT OF REITERATE A COUPLE OF THREE THING A COUPLE A COUPLE THINGS HERE A COUPLE OF THREE THINGS. AND. BUT ONE IS THAT WE'VE LEARNED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT ABOUT THIS IN A VERY RAPID. UP. PACE A RAPID. AMOUNT OF TIME. I WOULD SAY WERE ON A PRETTY STEEP TRAJECTORY OF LEARNING ABOUT BOTH SEAGRASS AND HELP. IS PLAYING A ROLE IN BOTH OCEAN ACIDIFICATION AND TO CARBON SEQUESTRATION. IN ORDER TO CONTINUE ON THAT ABOUT STEEP TRAJECTORY WE NEED TO SORT OF CONTINUE TO ANSWER THESE KNOWLEDGE GAPS THAT WE'VE BEEN IDENTIFYING TODAY AND SO I WILL JUST. YOU KNOW UNDERSCORE THAT IN THE STATE INVESTMENT IN THESE MONITORING AND RESEARCH EFFORTS HAS BEEN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN THAT TRAJECTORY. THE SECOND THING THAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT. THIS EVERYTHING I JUST TOLD YOU ABOUT IS REALLY A STORY THAT HAS BEEN FACILITATED BY PARTNERSHIPS AND I ACTUALLY WAS HAPPY THAT I HEARD AT LEAST TWO OF THE OTHER SPEAKERS. MENTIONED THE IMPORTANCE OF PARTNERSHIPS INCLUDING YOU. SO WHAT YOU HEARD WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED TO. REFLECTS PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES UNIVERSITIES CONSERVATION GROUPS AND VERY IMPORTANTLY THE SUSTAINABLE AQUACULTURE COMMUNITY. AND I WOULD PROPOSE THAT PARTNERSHIPS LIKE THIS ARE A MODEL FOR HOW WE SHOULD APPROACH CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE STATE. AND HOPEFULLY FEDERALLY IF WE CAN GET. THEIR THEIR EAR. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. SPEAKER. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN STONE AND. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND WHO SHOULD BE WATCHING OR LISTENING. I'LL START MY REMARKS BY SAYING AYE TO SORT OF CABINETS ON THE ODD WOMAN OUT ON THIS PANEL FOR TWO REASONS ONE IS THAT I'M NOT A SCIENTIST. I THE SECOND AND SO YOU'LL HAVE TO GIVE ALL YOUR HARD QUESTIONS TO CARRY AND TESSA AYE AT THE END BUT. THE SECOND IS THAT MY PROJECT IS NOT AN OCEAN ACIDIFICATION PROJECT AYE IT IS NEVER THE LESS RELEVANT. WELL I'LL I'LL TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT AND YOU KNOW I HAVE A VIDEO THAT WILL AYE. SUPPLEMENT FOR OUT MY FAILURE TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT IT. THE OCEAN ACIDIFICATION IS AS BAD NEWS FOR SHELLFISH AND. THOUGH SHELLFISH INDUSTRY RECOGNIZES THAT AND IN CONSEQUENCE THE NATURE CONSERVANCY AND. OYSTER AQUACULTURE OPERATORS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES ARE IN THE PROCESS OF FORMING WHAT WE'RE CALLING THE. AYE. I'M SORRY THE SHELLFISH CLIMATE COALITION WHICH WILL OPERATE AT THE STATE AND LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY. ON THE INDUSTRY IS IS IS WORRIED ABOUT THE EFFECT OF OUR OCEAN ACIDIFICATION ON ITS BOTTOM LINE AND THAT OBVIOUSLY IS THAT MEANS THAT OCEAN ACIDIFICATION IS ALSO BAD NEWS FOR SHELLFISH CONSUMERS. WE ALL KNOW THAT OYSTERS ARE DELICIOUS AND WE WANT TO. CONTINUE TO PRODUCE THEM IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA IS IN FACT THE THIRD LARGEST SHELLFISH CONSUMING STATE IN THE UNITED STATES UP BUT IN STATE SHELLFISH PRODUCTION MEETS LESS THAN HALF OF THAT DEMAND. OUR STATE SHELLFISH INDUSTRY COULD BE SUPPLYING A SUBSTANTIAL UNSUSTAINABLE LOCAL. I. N. EXPORT MARKET AND CALIFORNIA COULD BE LEADING THE NATION AND MEETING AND EVER GROWING SHELLFISH DEMAND WHILE CREATING ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE LOCAL BLUE JOBS IN COASTAL COMMUNITIES. BUT WE'RE CONFLICTED ABOUT THE GROWTH OF THIS INDUSTRY BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND AND UNDERSTOOD EVEN BEFORE THE MOST RECENT SCIENCE ON OCEAN ACIDIFICATION THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ILL GRASS HABITAT. OUGHT TO OVERRIDE A WIDE VARIETY OF SPECIES AND AND MARRYING SOME OF THE OTHER PANELISTS ON THE FIRST PANEL. DETAIL THAT I THINK VERY WELL. ILL GROUSE IS SUPPOSE COULD CRITICAL ASTRON HABITAT FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF MARINE INVERTEBRATES FISH MAMMALS BIRDS AS WELL AS NURSERY GROUNDS. FOR FISH. THAT ALSO THE ABILITY TO MODIFY THE SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT IT'S AN AYE ECOLOGICAL ENGINEER A KEEP SETTLEMENTS IN PLACE AND IMPROVE THE WATER QUALITY. AND SO THE RECENTLY PUBLICIZED. OCEAN ACIDIFICATION BENEFIT MITIGATION SCIENCE IS JUST SORT OF THE ICING ON ALREADY VALUABLE. CAKE. BUT IT'S GOOD NEWS FOR THE INDUSTRY IN THE SENSE THAT IT'S. FINALLY SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO ABOUT OCEAN ACIDIFICATION UNIT WE CAN INCREASE THAT ARE EXPANSIVE SEA GRASS AND OUR MEADOWS AND IT HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT THEY'VE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT AND THE REASON THAT THE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN WORRIED ABOUT IT IS THAT ILL GRASS HAS. BEEN UP UNTIL THIS POINT AND CONTINUES TO BE. PROBABLY THE. GREATEST OBSTACLE IN INCREASING. SHELLFISH GROWING CAPACITY IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA ILL GRASS MITIGATION POLICY OR THE CAMP AND THAT WAS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE LEVEL OF PROTECTION. OF FOR THIS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT HABITAT. THE POLICY IS ALSO THE MAJOR ARE LIMITING FACTOR IN THE PERMITTING PROCESS AT WHICH AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW. A FROM THE TIME OF THE COASTAL COMMISSION CAN TAKE UPWARDS OF EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO GO FROM. SERVE THE VISUALIZATION OF AN OPERATION TO. ACTUAL OPERATION. THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF THE CLIENT TO SUPPORT ADVERSE IMPACTS OF AQUACULTURE ON ILL GRASS BUT A LOT OF THAT WAS FROM OUR TRADITIONAL AQUACULTURE METHODS A LOT OF. OFTEN INVOLVING PLANTING OYSTERS ACTUALLY IN THE SUBSTRATE AND THEN RAKING THEM UP AND NOT SURPRISINGLY ILL GRASS DOESN'T LIKE THAT KIND OF THING. AND SO ON THE OTHER HAND WE ALSO HAVE ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE FROM OUR INDUSTRY PARTNERS THAT ARE PROPERLY SPACED HANGING BASKETS AND LONG LINES. AYE HAS LESS IMPACT AND MAY EVEN HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON ILL GRASS GROWTH. SO THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE VOID OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THESE SERVE NOVEL AQUACULTURE METHODS ON. THE AQUACULTURE EELGRASS INTERACTIONS AND IN CONSEQUENCE WE'VE PUT TOGETHER AN INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM FROM THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. UC SANTA CRUZ ACTUALLY ONE OF TESSA'S OF FORMER OPPOSE STOCKS AS IS LEADING THIS EFFORT FOR UC SANTA CRUZ AND THE HOG ISLAND OYSTER COMPANY AND I WANNA JUST IDENTIFY TERRY SAWYER WHO'S HERE. FROM. FROM THAT COMPANYAND WE'RE ASSESSING HILL GROUSED AQUACULTURE INTERACTIONS ON ACTUALLY USING DRONES WILL BE ABLE TO SEE SOME OF THE FOOTAGE FROM. FROM THE VIDEO COMING UP. WE BELIEVE THAT BY DEVELOPING COST EFFECTIVE MONITORING APPROACHES TO SURVEY ILL GRASS SORT OF IN SITU WE CAN ALLOW THE AQUACULTURE INDUSTRY AND REGULATORY AGENCIES TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY. AQUACULTURE PRODUCTS WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY. PROTECTING THE ECOLOGICAL COMPONENTS. THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT SO ONCE THE MONITORING PROTOCOLS BEEN TESTED AND VALIDATED WE INTEND TO HAND OFF TO THE INDUSTRY ITSELF. SO THEY CAN BE WHEN THEY'RE OUT THERE IN THEIR FIELDS THEY CAN BE MONITORING THEIR OWN IMPACTS ON. ON ILL GRASS AND THIS WILL I THINK. AYE EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF DATA ON NOT JUST THE HEALTH OF YOUR GRASS AND IT. TOOK PARTICULAR AND. ESTUARY BUT ALSO UP PROVIDE A LOT OF THIS. CERTAIN OBSERVATIONAL INFORMATION ON PROTOCOL WILL REALLY HELP TO UNDERSTAND THESE INTERACTIONS STATEWIDE AND I IT'S IT'S WORTH SAYING ESPECIALLY WITH REFERENCE TO. THE THE. INFORMATION ON THE DIE OFF IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY AS PERTAINS TO. LAST LAST WINTER'S RAINFALL. THOSE MONITORING WITH DRONES BECAUSE IT IS SO CHEAP AND ACCURATE WILL ALLOW US TO GET A TEMPORAL RESOLUTION ON SORT OF THE INNER SEASONAL VARIATION AND. EELGRASS EXTENT THAT WE'RE NOT WE'RE JUST SIMPLY NOT ABLE TO GET BY SENDING DIVERS DOWN THERE THEY JUST AREN'T UNWILLING TO ARE UNABLE TO. GO DOWN AS OFTEN AS WE NEED TO GET THAT KIND OF TEMPORAL RESOLUTION. I'M SO WE'RE REALLY HOPING THAT THIS. HONORING PROTOCOL WILL REALLY INCREASE OUR SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE. I'M SO IN SOME THE INDUSTRY KNOWS BETTER THAN ANYBODY THAT HEALTHY ILL GRASS MEANS MORE OYSTERS AND AN IMPROVED BOTTOM LINE. AND WITH THAT I GUESS I WOULD ASK YOU TO PLAY THIS LITTLE INFORMATIONAL VIDEO THAT WE'VE PRODUCED. NNOVA. THIS. CHOOSE BECOMING ANY SILLY IMPORTANT GLOBAL SHOULD SORT. AND WITH THIS GROWTH COMES URGENT UNANSWERED. THE INTERACTION. OPERATIONS BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE WITH OUR EGOS. AT THE NATURE CONSERVANCY WE ARE FOCUSING ON ADDRESSING MANY OF THESE IN PART BY BRINGING TOGETHER SO TESTS AND INDUSTRY AND TOMORROW THEY CALIFORNIA RIGHT AND CENTER SUPPOSE BACKYARD. MONITOR ONE PARTICULAR EGOS. GIL GRASS THE. IS IN PARDON IN ASTRI. BECAUSE. SO IT'S HOMES FOR A LOT OF INVERTEBRATES. FISH. A NURSERY HABITAT FOR JUVENILE STAGES OF FISH INCLUDING SOME FULL IMPORTANT. HE'S. STILL PARADIGM IS. CULTURE ACT THIS. I'M STILL TO SEE GASES HOWEVER UP PARTNERS AT HOMETOWN LISTA COMPANIES HAVE. OBSERVE THAT SOME INSTANCES THE HILL GRASS THAT. SO THERE AQUACULTURE TERRIBLE EXPAND INTO THEIR LEASES AND GROW IN AND AROUND. YEAR. WE THE FUNNY SELFISH S. LOCATIONS STAY FOR JUST ABOUT FIVE YEARS. AND I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN THAT IS AMONG THE MOST SUSTAINABLE WAYS TO TO GROW ANIMAL PROTEIN. THE PRIMARY IS FOR DOING AT ALL IN THESE IN YOUR SHORT FIREMAN. WHICH IS WHERE HE'S RESOURCES LIKE YOUR GLASS ARE. BEING IN A BUSINESS WHERE YOU TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HIM. WHAT WERE ABOUT TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT USING SCIENCE IS REALLY AN IMPORTANT PART? WE'VE SEEN CHANGES OUT HERE IN THE SAY OVER THE PAST THIRTY YEARS. WE'VE SEEN THE GROWTH IN THE THE EXPANSION OF THE REAL GRASS BEDS WE A BUFFER AREAS THAT ALL THE SUDDEN THE ADDRESSES MOVED IN. WE HAVE QUESTIONS WE HAVE THAT NEED TO BE ANSWERED OVER TIME. WHAT ARE? WHAT ARE THE DEBT? THE NEGATIVE. TO HAVE A TOOL DEVELOPED THAT IS COST EFFECTIVE ENOUGH THE GROWERS GENERAL CAN USE. WOULD BE. USING BENEFICIAL BUT THERE'S. UNCERTAINTY. AROUND SOMEBODY ENVIRONMENTAL INTERACTIONS AND I WANT TO UNDERSTAND THIS. I UNDERSTAND OUR AFFECTS NEGATIVE POSITIVE. THIS IS SUCH A GREAT STUDY BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO HELP US ANSWER SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS HOPEFULLY NOT JUST LOST PAYMENT BAY IS ALL AROUND US. ANSWER THESE. OUR TEAM IS LAUNCHING DRONES DIRECTLY OVER HIGH ISLAND OYSTER. FARMING OPERATIONS MONITOR THE GROWTH APPEAL GROUND. PROVEN TO BE EFFECTIVE. S. MONITORING TOOL IN THE HANDS OF FARMERS ALLOWING THE ON. INDUSTRY. VALUABLE CAN. FORMATION. ILL GRAB. OPERATION. THE RESEARCHERS AT UC SANTA CRUZ. TELL BROWN. TERMINATION. WHERE THE YOU'LL GRAB? THAT WE CAN USE THAT TWO FIVE. IN OTHER IN. BEING THAT WE'VE RECOVERING A LITTLE BIT LARGER AREA. GO ON FROM MULTIPLE YEARS CAN. THAT I THINK. NOW THAT ONLY OVER THE YEARS IN TALKING TO THE NATURE CONSERVANCY NEVER DID UNDERSTAND IT THAT WAS IMPORTANT IN THE BUILDING DID HONEST OPUS. DEVELOP A STUDY FINE I COULD PARTNERS AND LOOK AT THIS ISSUE IN THAT REALM. AND HOPEFULLY DEVELOPMENT THAT WILL HELP ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS. THIS THING IS WE ARE THE BEST PARTNERS WE GET THIS DATA BECAUSE WE'RE OUT OF ALL THE TIME. AND WE SHOULD KNOW WANT TO KNOW ABOUT WHAT'S GOING. I FEEL AS IF YOU WILL. SO TO ME THIS IS. WHAT'S REALLY EXCITING ABOUT THE. THE NEED FOR THIS TYPE OF RESEARCH TO FILL GAPS IN OUR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT YOUR GRASS CULTURE INTERACTIONS HAS NEVER BEEN MORE URGENT. COLLABORATIVE PROJECTS THAT UNITE INDUSTRY. SCIENTISTS AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES. THE POTENTIAL TO HELP PROMOTE HEALTHY EGOS. AND CHANGE THE WAY WE SURPRISE SUSTAINABLE SEAFOOD FROM I THINK. I THINK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE FOR THE INVITATION. IT'S. IT'S REALLY PLEASURE TO BE HERE TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE RESEARCH THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON AND I JUST FIRST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT. ALL TALK ABOUT SOME WORK THAT I'VE BEEN DOING IN COLLABORATION WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE SO THERE'S MANY SCIENTISTS THAT WORK ON THAT'S I'M I MAKE HOUSE IN NORTHRIDGE THEIR SCIENTISTS PRIME STANFORD UNIVERSITY HOPKINS MARINE STATION AT UC DAVIS AND WE ALSO HAVE PARTNERS WITH THE BAY FOUNDATION. WHICH TO ENTER INTO THE MICROPHONE BEGIN HERE AND FOR THE RECORD YET SO WE HAVE. ALSO HAVE A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE BAY FOUNDATION WHICH IS. ANOTHER ORGANIZATION THAT'S BEEN MENTIONED I MANY TIMES ALREADY SO ALL BEACH SORT OF CHANGING THE FOCUS FROM SEAGRASSES OVER TO HELP. SO I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT SOME RESULTS WE HAVE SOME FROM CURRENT PROJECTS OF THE FIRST PROJECTS IS THAT IT WAS REALLY THIS BASELINE DATA OF SEA WATER CHEMISTRY NICK HELP FOREST AND. THIS REALLY STARTED OFF AS A SIDE PROJECT THAT HAD NO FUNDING BEHIND IT AND WE WERE ABLE TO JUST COBBLE TOGETHER PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW WERE INTERESTED IN THE STATE. AND NOT SOME SOME WORK THAT HAS BEEN PUBLISHED THAT WE'RE WORKING ON AND THEN THESE TWO OTHER STUDIES. KIND OF CAME OUT OF THAT DOT IS FIRST SORT OF EFFORT BECAUSE PEOPLE REALLY INTEREST IN THESE QUESTIONS BUT THERE WAS REALLY NO INFORMATION AVAILABLE ABOUT. CUT FORESTS AND THEIR POTENTIAL TO MILITARY WATER CHEMISTRY. SO FOLLOWING UP ON THAT NOW I'M WE HAVE FUNDING FROM THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION TO DO A REALLY MECHANISTIC STUDY TO QUANTIFY RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN. HOW BIG THE CULT FOREST IS WHAT THE OCEANOGRAPHY LOOKS LIKE IN THE AREA AND THEN THE IMPACT ON THE SEA WATER CHEMISTRY AND? WE REALLY WON'T BE ABLE TO TELL YOU WHERE OR WHEN AND SO WE UNDERSTAND THOSE MECHANISMS AND THE SORT OF INTERPLAY BETWEEN THOSE DIFFERENT I'M FACTORS. AND THEN LASTLY I'M THIS UP IN THIS NEW PROJECT THAT STARTING WITH. THAT'S FUNDED BY U. S. CITIES SEE GRANT PROGRAM WE'RE LOOKING AT RESTORATION STATES THAT THE BAY FOUNDATION ARE DOING SO SO THE CALPERS FRUSTRATION IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW TO GOING INTO THOSE URCHIN PARENTS AND MANUALLY REMOVING HER CHANCEL THOSE URCHINS ARE THERE BECAUSE OF LIKE YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF THINKING OF THE LANCE THE INTERFACE BECAUSE. THE REASON NOT THAT URCHINS WERE ABLE TO REALLY GET A STRONGHOLD WAS BECAUSE OF POLLUTION AND OTHER SORT OF MULTIPLE STRESSORS THAT WERE OCCURRING. AND SO NOW IS THAT SOME OF THE STRESSES ARE REMOVED I'M YOU KNOW THEY'RE GOING THROUGH THE REMOVING OUR CHANCE AND WE'RE LOOKING AT AS THIS CULT IS COMING IN. WERE INVOLVED IN THAT THE EFFORT. THAT. I'M WAS MENTIONED EARLIER WITH THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY LOOKING AT THE POTENTIAL FOR WAVE ATTENUATION OF CULT FOREST WHICH WOULD BE THIS ADDITIONAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICE ON TOP OF ALL THE OTHER ECOSYSTEM SERVICES THEY RD PROVIDE. AND THE NOW WE'RE FINALLY GONNA START SEEING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE A HABITAT THAT WAS DEVOID OF KELP WHAT THAT CHEMISTRY LOOK LIKE AND THEN WHAT IS THE CHEMISTRY LOOK LIKE ONCE WE HAVE A HEALTHY CUP FORCE THAT'S GROWING SO. WE NOW HAVE FUNDING TO LOOK AT THAT AS WELL. SO FIRST I JUST WANTED TO YOU KNOW SORT OF REMIND US ALL WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE IN A CUP FOREST IF YOU'VE BEEN IN A CULT FOREST. AND SO YOU KNOW MOST OF THE BIOMASS IS THAT THE SURFACE SO THEY HAVE THESE MASSIVE CANOPY IS THAT YOU CAN SEE FROM SATELLITE IMAGES WHICH ARE REALLY HANDY IN TERMS OF MAPPING THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF COUPLE ON THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE OF THE CULT IS ALTERING THE HABITAT AND IT'S CHANGING THE WAY IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGING THE WAY THE WATER MOVES IN THIS AREA BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A SOLID OBJECT AND WATER MOVING RIGHT. IT CAN'T GO THROUGH THE SOLID OBJECTS IT'S EITHER GONNA HAVE TO GO AROUND HER OR DO SOMETHING OR SLOW DOWN TO GO THROUGH THOSE AREAS AND SO THERE'S SOME REALLY INTERESTING FEEDBACKS BETWEEN THAT HELP ITSELF. AND THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND HOW MUCH POTENTIAL YOU HAVE TO MODIFY THE WATER COLUMN. BUT THEY'RE STILL YOU KNOW A LOT OF BIOMASS THAT'S UNDER WATER AS WELL AND IT YOU KNOW JUST FURTHER ADDS TO THIS IDEA THAT THERE'S THIS PHYSICAL STRUCTURE THAT'S THROUGHOUT THE WATER COLUMN YOU KNOW FROM THIRTY TO FIFTY FEET THAT. IS ALSO IMPACTING ON THESE HABITATS AND REALLY INTERESTING WAYS AND SO ARE SORT OF TAKE ON THIS IS TO MEASURE ALL OF THOSE THINGS REALLY GET A HANDLE ON THE OCEANOGRAPHY. ON WHAT THAT HELP IS DOING AND THE CHEMISTRY. SO HERE'S I'M SOME OF WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION ABOUT IF HOPE FOR ITS CAN USED AS A MANAGEMENT TOOL TO MITIGATE XIN ACIDIFICATION. SO THERE DEFINITELY IS SOME POTENTIAL FOR HELP AND THERE'S SOME INDICATION THAT CALPERS LOCALLY RAISE P. H.. IN IN SOME OF THE SOME OF THE TIME SERIOUS FROM THIS WORK THAT WE DID WHICH WAS I'M SAMPLING OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR. AYE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THAT HELP FOREST OF UP TO ZERO POINT FIVE PEACH UNITS AT TIMES AND ALSO THERE'S A REALLY INTERESTING VERTICAL GRADIENT SO. I'M. AT THE SURFACE THE BEAT THE PEACH AS HIGH AS WHICH MAKES SENSE BECAUSE THAT'S AGAIN OR MOST OF THIS CULT MATERIAL IS LOCATED. AND THEN AT THE BOTTOM THAT PEACH WITH HIGHEST AT A SITE WITH LOW WAVE ACTIVITIES SO WE LOOK TO SI. THIS BIG HELP FOR US IN FRONT OF HOPKINS MARINE STATION NEXT THE MONTEREY BAY AQUARIUM. AND THE SITE THAT WAS MORE WE'VE PROTECTED HIDE A BIGGER DIFFERENCE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE BUT THE SITE THAT HAD MORE WE'VE EXPOSURE THERE SO MUCH WATER MOTION THAT IT BASICALLY JUST GOT SPLASHED OUT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TIME AT THE BOTTOM. FOR THAT HELP TO REALLY MAKE ANY KIND OF AN IMPACT AND WE HAVE SOME PRELIMINARY DATA THAT WAS I'M TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS EFFORT WITH ON THE BAY FOUNDATION AND A PHD STUDENT CRESCENT ELSEWHERE FROM UC DAVIS. AT THIS CUP FOREST RESTORATION SITE WHERE. WE TOOK SOME. DODD SOME CHEMISTRY DATA AND YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS POT THAT THESE THESE BROWN MARKS ARE SHOWING. THAT HELP ABUNDANCE THERE TIME AND SO SHOWING THAT YOU NOTED THAT IN THE BEGINNING OF THE RESTORATION THEY REMOVED URCHINS THEY KNOW THE COP WASN'T THERE AND THEN THE CULT STARTED COMING IN. AND WE SAMPLED SOME OF THE CHEMISTRY AND I WAS THE COP STARTED GROWING AND WE DEFINITELY SAW IT THIS INCREASE IN PH THE WILL BE. GOING BACK TO SOME OF THE SIGHTS AND AN ADDITIONAL RESTORATION SITES TO COLLECT. MORE DATA. SO THAT'S YOU KNOW SORT OF WHERE WE'RE AT NOW BUT WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF TIME QUESTIONS AND WE'RE WORKING ON SOME STUFF THAT I THINK WILL REALLY ALLOW US TO ADVANCE THE ANSWERS TO THIS QUESTION OVER THE NEXT TWO TO THREE YEARS. SO FIRST YOU KNOW UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS SHOULD WE EXPECT A CULT FOREST EFFECT ON CHEMISTRY SO WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO QUANTIFY MECHANISTICALLY THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN. CUT FOR A SITE IS THE LOCAL LOCAL OCEANOGRAPHY AND THE SEA WATER CHEMISTRY AND NOT YOU KNOW IS REALLY GONNA ALLOW US TO SEE. IN THIS PARTICULAR HABITAT THAT HAS THIS SORT OF WAVE ENVIRONMENT YES LIKE WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE IN A FACT OR MAYBE NO WE WOULDN'T EXPECT ISSUE THAT AFFECTS THAT'S THAT'S REALLY THE BIG GOAL. I MEAN WILL BE COLLECTING DATA. THIS SUMMER AND MODERATE A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT SITES AND THE NEXT SUMMER I'M AS WELL AND WE'RE SORT OF TARGETING THE TIME WHEN WE KNOW THE CULPRIT OF IS THE HIGHEST WILL BE WHAT EXPECTANCY A DIFFERENCE. BECAUSE DURING WINNER WHEN THE COPS ENOUGH SAYS THERE REALLY ISN'T ANY DIFFERENCE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE BECAUSE THAT HELP IS AT SUCH A LOW DENSITY BUT WILL BE ABLE TO SORT OF PUT SOME. YOU KNOW BOUNDS ON THOSE TYPES OF RELATIONSHIPS. AND HEN YOU KNOW THE NEXT QUESTION IS CUT FOREST RESTORATION LEAD TO A CHANGE IN SEA WATER CHEMISTRY SERVICES WORK WILL BE DOING OVER THE NEXT YEAR WE'RE GONNA MEASURE CHANGES IN SEA WATER CHEMISTRY WHEN HIS CUP FORESTS ARE RESTORED. SO THAT PROJECT IS STARTING RIGHT NOW BOTH OF THESE PROJECTS ARE STARTING RIGHT NOW AND SO YOU KNOW REALLY WILL BE ABLE TO KNOW SOME THINGS I'M I THINK PRETTY SOON WITHIN THE NEXT. TWO TO THREE YEARS I MEAN WE ARE ABLE THAT TO DO SOME SOME GOOD WORK WITH WITHOUT FUNDING AND I'M EXCITED THAT NOW WE HAVE FUNDING FROM THE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL BE ABLE TO YOU I'M REALLY ADVANCE OUR KNOWLEDGE ON THESE TOPICS. AND THEN YOU KNOW WHERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE PRIORITIZE PROTECTION AND RESTORATION LOTS OF COURSE THIS BIG QUESTION THAT PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW AND AND FROM RESULTS OF THESE TWO STUDIES. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO PREDICT WHEN AND WHERE HELP FOREST'S WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON CHEMISTRY AND SO AGAIN I THINK ABOUT THAT THE SORT OF END OF THE DATA COLLECTION BASIN AS WERE TRYING TO PUT ALL THE PIECES TOGETHER. HOPEFULLY WITHIN THE NEXT TWO THREE YEARS WILL HAVE SOME ANSWERS FOR YOU. SO IMPORTANT NEXT STEPS. ONE OF THE THINGS. BUT MOST BUT NOT. ALL. OKAY SO SO I GUESS THAT AFTER MECHANISTIC STUDIES WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO PRIORITIZE THE IT'S AND. AND THIS THE REALLY COOL THING ABOUT HELP IS THAT. IT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK DONE ON MAPPING ALREADY AND BECAUSE YOU CAN SEEK HELP AND SATELLITES THERE'S THIS WHOLE TEAM OF PEOPLE I'M LED BY TOM BELL AYE AYE UC SANTA BARBARA AND KYLE CAVANAUGH AT UCLA. WHERE THEY HAVE REALLY DONE THE WORK AND THEY CAN GO BACK TO THE EIGHTIES LOOKING AT HISTORICAL SATELLITE IMAGES AND COME OUT ALL OF THE CULT FORESTS THAT WERE ALONG STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ARE NOW EXPANDING IT UP ALONG THE WHOLE WEST COAST OF THE U. S.? AND TOM AS A COLLABORATOR ON ON THE WORK THAT IDEAL AND SO WE WILL BE ABLE TO AND THEY CAN ALSO LOOK AT WHICH CUT FOR US HAVE BEEN THE MOST PERSISTENT WHICH I THINK IS ANOTHER BIG PIECE OF THIS PUZZLE OF WHICH ONES YOU MIGHT WANT TO PRIORITIZE. FOR PROTECTION AND RESTORATION SO. SO IN YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MAPPING IT THERE'S UP I THINK A REALLY BIG POTENTIAL HAD. TIME TO DO SOME GOOD WORK IN THE FUTURE. AND THEN THERE'S. A LOT OF PROJECTS COMING ON BOARD I'M SURE YOU KNOW ABOUT THERE'S ARTIFICIAL REEFS GOING AND AND THE USER ACTUALLY REALLY GREAT OPPORTUNITIES TO COLLECT SIMILAR DATA TO THAT THAT WERE ALREADY COLLECTING. SO THAT WE CAN YOU KNOW. SAMPLE MORE AND MORE SITES AT THAT THIS POINT IT'S IT'S A LIMITATION OF YOU KNOW WE CAN'T BE IN ALL OF THESE PLACES AT ONCE AND SO TRYING TO SAMPLE AS MANY SITES AS POSSIBLE. TO REALLY FILL OUT THAT SPACE TO UNDERSTAND WHERE AND WHEN WE SHOULD EXPECT TO SEE AN EFFECTIVE HELP ON THAT WATER CON CHEMISTRY. SO I THINK MOVING FORWARD THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD OPPORTUNITIES IN THE STATE. AND THEN LASTLY THERE'S REALLY I AGREE EFFORTS GOING ON IN OTHER STE AND OTHER STATES AND EVEN JUST PREPARING TO BE HERE TODAY I SPOKE WITH. PEOPLE OUT I'M FROM WASHINGTON STATE WHO ARE THEY RIGHT NOW HAVE A TWO AND A HALF ACRE. CULT AQUACULTURE CITE SUGAR CULT AND THEY HAVE THEIR IT'S A COLLABORATION WITH. AQUACULTURE WITH. STATE AGENCIES WITH FEDERAL AGENCIES WITH NO I AS WELL AS WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON AND SO THEY'RE LOOKING AT THIS THEY'RE LOOKING AT SUGAR CULT WHICH IS NOT. CANOPY FORMING SPECIES LIKE MACRO CISTUS. THAT THE GIANT HELP OR THE BOOK HEALTH. SO IT'S IT'S BASICALLY JUST LIKE ONE LIKE LONG BLADE BUT THEY'RE GROWING IT ON LINES AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE OCEANOGRAPHY IN THE AREA WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE WATER CHEMISTRY AS WELL AS USES OF THE KELP AND TRYING TO SEE IF THERE'S. A WAY THAT THEY COULD BE GROWING MISC HELP THAT THAT WE COULD BRING IT ON LAND AND USED FOR FERTILIZER OR AN ANIMAL FEED FOR FOR AGRICULTURE SO. THEY'RE REALLY TRYING TO TAKE A HOLISTIC VIEW OF WHAT DESK HELP AQUACULTURE I'M IMPACT COULD HAVE SO WE HAVE NOW BEGUN SORT OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT SHARING YOU KNOW. TRYING TO COMPARE DATA SETS THINKING ABOUT DIFFERENT SPECIES AND SORT OF THE BENEFITS THAT THEY. THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE DIFFERENT SUBSPECIES AND THEN OF COURSE WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH I MEAN WE DON'T REALLY KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THESE QUESTIONS FOR BALK HELPS ALL THE WORK THAT I'VE BEEN DOING IS ON GIANT CULT IN CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND. BOOK HELP IS. YOU KNOW KIND OF A DIFFERENT BEAST THAN. THAN GIANT KELP BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S I THINK ANOTHER BIG NEXT STEP IS TO TO MOVE FORWARD WITH AN ADDED SPECIALLY WITH THE LOSS OF OF BOOK HEALTH IS. ANSWERING SIMILAR SORTS OF QUESTIONS SO I I GUESS. YEAH I'LL JUST AND BY YOU KNOW THINKING YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF I'M REALLY EXCITING PROJECTS. COMING UP AND THERE'S A LOT OF MOMENTUM ON THIS AND. IT'S IT'S A REALLY GOOD TIMES YOU I'M. TO BE ADDRESSING THESE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. DOZEN GO WITHOUT NOTICE THAT FUNDING NEEDED YEAH BUT THE COUPLE POINTS THERE THAT'S. THAT'S THAT'S REALLY GOOD. UP WITH WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE I JUST RAN INTO ONE OF THE PRINCIPLES THAT A COMPANY AND I DON'T MEMBER THE COMPANY'S NAME BUT THE WEBSITE IS PLANET DOT COM. THEY HAVE PUT INTO ORBIT. A NUMBER OF LOWER EARTH ORBIT. POLAR SATELLITES SO AS THE EARTH SPINS UNDERNEATH IT THEY LITERALLY GET. AS AS LIFE BY LINE IMAGE OF THE ENTIRE PLANET EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND THE DATE IS AVAILABLE THERE. AS I UNDERSTAND IT LOOKING TO TALK TO FOLKS WHO INTEREST IN THIS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT CENTERS IT'S ALL OPTICAL SENSORS NOW WHAT OTHER SENSORS THEY CAN PUT UP. SIDE OF THAT IS A RESOURCE THAT YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH I JUST LEARNED ABOUT IT BUT WHAT AN INCREDIBLE. RESOURCE THAT THEY'RE MAKING THAT DATA AVAILABLE. TO ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO TO USE IT IN THIS COULD BE VERY VERY VALLEY WITH IF THEY'RE VERY JUST SIT AND. COLLECTING THAT DATA THROUGH THE DATA FROM UNDERSTANDING CLIMATE CHANGE AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE BUT THAT'S THAT'S QUITE A RESOURCE LOOK AT THE DRONE FOOTAGE AND AND. HOW WE MONITOR AND MANAGE AND ALL THE IMAGES OF OF KELP BEDS SORT OF FOOD THAT FLUCTUATING AROUND THE BECAUSE? THAT'S A REALLY GOOD. RESOURCE POTENTIALLY SO IF YOU HADN'T HEARD ABOUT THAT. AND FOR. THIS NEW QUIRK THE NATURE CONSERVANCY I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE I THINK EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM. WOULD SAY WE'VE GOT TO RESTORE BECAUSE THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. BUT FOR A LOT OF OTHERS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ECONOMIC BENEFIT OF WHY ELSEWHERE RESTORING OF COURSE. LOVE THE OYSTERS FROM HOG ISLAND AND OTHERS. BUT THAT'S HIGH IN AQUACULTURE AND THAT'S WHY SEATS YOU WILL BE AT THE AIRPORT AT. SO IT MUST MANY MARINE LAB THEY'VE GOT UP THERE A BURGEONING. AQUACULTURE PROGRAM THERE THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO FEED INTO THE AQUACULTURE INDUSTRY AND AND REALLY GROW THE CAPACITY IN CALIFORNIA. TO TRAIN PEOPLE TO LEARN ABOUT IT SO THAT WE CAN DEVELOP AND AQUACULTURE INDUSTRY AND HAVING THE ECONOMIC BASIS FOR THIS WORK AS WELL AS THE ENVIRONMENTAL BASIS IT'S WORK. THOSE PARTNERSHIPS TRULY I THINK ARE IMPORTANT. APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING IN THAT HOG ISLAND OTHERS ARE DOING. TO HELP US UNDERSTAND THE. THE IMPLICATIONS BUT ONE THING THAT STRUCK ME. ESPECIALLY WITH THE TAMALES BAY. KNOWING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT OF COURSE THAT HUMBLE BAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE THE FRESH WATER FLUSHING THROUGH SERVICES GO BACK. EACH OF THOSE HAVE VERY VERY DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS ABOUT TITLE FLOW CURRENT INTO MOLLIS PAGES SORT OF CATCHES ALL OF THAT. NORTH SOUTH CURRENT. ALONG THE COAST AND SO DOESN'T FLUSH THE SAME WAY THAT SOME OF THE OTHER BAYS ARE HOW IMPORTANT IS THAT IN. THE INVESTIGATIONS AND AND ARE YOU LOOKING AT. THE DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS OF THESE PLACES. OR IS THIS STILL EARLY ENOUGH THAT THAT'S. SO IT IS NOT BE LOOKED AT YEAH ABSOLUTELY SIR THAT IS WAS A FUNDAMENTAL GOAL OF THAT EXPANSION TO ALL SIX OF THOSE SITES SO WE STARTED IN BODEGA AND SMALLEST BANG A. ORIGINALLY AND THEN WE'VE MOVED STATEWIDE IN PART OF IN PART DUE TO THE OBSERVATION THAT YOU JUST MADE WHICH IS THAT EACH OF THESE ACTUARIES. REALLY FUNCTION DIFFERENTLY AN EVEN SITES WITH IN ACTUARIES BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY SO I WOULD SAY THE SITES THAT WERE MONITORING WITHIN SMALLEST BAY. IF YOU'RE OUT TOWARDS THE MOUTH THREE YOU'RE GETTING A LOT OF OCEANOGRAPHIC INFLUENCE WE SEE SOME DIFFERENT PATTERNS AND CHARACTERISTICS THAN WE DO IN SEA GRASS MEADOWS THAT ARE MORE IN THE INTERIOR OF THE BAY. AND SO ALONG WITH THOSE. SENSORS FOR OCEAN ACIDIFICATION WE ALSO PUT SENSORS THAT ACTUALLY MONITOR THE FLOW OF THE WATER THROUGH THE SEA GRASS MEADOW. AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT DOCTOR NICHOLS WAS BROUGHT UP ABOUT WHEN WATER COMES UP AGAINST THE SEAGRASS MEADOW IS IT SLOWING AND AS IT MOVES TO THE SEA GRASS MEADOW OR IS IT MOVING AROUND THE EDGES. AND ARE THOSE BEHAVIORS DIFFERENT AT DIFFERENT SITES WITHIN AN ACTUARY ARE THEY DIFFERENT MORE BROADLY ACROSS THE STATE IN DIFFERENT ACTUARIES. AND WE WOULD LOVE TO ANSWER ALL OF THAT AND THAT'S THOSE ARE SOME BIG QUESTIONS. WOULD PROBABLY CAN'T ANSWER IT IMMEDIATELY BUT YES THAT'S OF THE DESIGN OF THE STUDY WAS ABSOLUTELY TO GET AT SOME OF THOSE DIFFERENCES OKAY OKAY WELL THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE IT'S JUST. WHAT LITTLE I KNOW ABOUT SOME OF SAID YES AND I KNOW THAT THEY? THAT THEY DO FUNCTIONAL LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY AND THEN. AND DOCTOR YOU ALSO MENTIONED YOU OFFER PUT SEAGRASS. WITH OYSTERS. AND IS THAT SAID THAT YOU CAN. SEE ABOUT THAT THE GROWTH OF THE OYSTERS YET OR OTHER SO WE ARE TRYING TO MONITOR. GROWTH RATE CHANGES WITH THE OYSTERS IF THEY'RE INSIDE VERSUS OUTSIDE OF THE SEAGRASS MEADOWS AND THOUGHT THAT PROJECT IS BEING LED BY CHRISTY CROKER WHO IS THE COLLEAGUES THAT WE HAVE IN COMMON HERE SO SHE'S ON MULTIPLE OF THESE PROJECTS SHE'S AT UC SANTA CRUZ. AND YOU KNOW PART OF THAT IS AGAIN TO LOOK AT THE. BIOLOGICAL SIGNALS. AS WELL AS A DOCTOR STOCK WHICH BROUGHT UP EARLIER WE ACTUALLY CAN'T JUST MONITOR THE CHEMISTRY WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE BIOLOGICAL RESPONSE TO THOSE THOSE CHEMICAL CHANGES. BUT I ALSO THINK THERE ARE SOME FUNDAMENTAL. DECISIONS THAT COULD BE MAN MADE ABOUT THE MANAGEMENT OF SUSTAINABLE AQUACULTURE AND SEAGRASSES TOGETHER WITH IN AN ACTUARY. IF WE KNEW HOW THOSE SEAGRASSES WERE IMPACTING. ORGANISMS THAT FORMER SHELLS SO. IN ADDITION TO THE BIGGER PICTURE INTERESTS OF THE STATE IF FOR THINKING ABOUT THE INTERESTS OF SUBSTANTIVE AQUACULTURE IT'S ACTUALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW. WHETHER OR NOT BEING INSIDE OF THE SEA GRASS MEADOW OR ON THE EDGE OF THE SEA GRASS MEADOW OR RIGHT OUTSIDE THE SEA GRASS MEADOW. IS THE OPTIMAL PLACE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF AN OYSTER. OKAY. YEAH THAT'S IN AND THAT'S WHY ALL THESE COLLABORATIONS I THINK A REALLY IMPORTANT AND IF WE CAN TAKE. IN. BUT A PRODUCTIVE USE OF SOME OF THESE SYSTEMS THROUGH SUSTAINABLE AQUACULTURE AS WELL AS HELP TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM SO THAT THEY ACTUALLY FUNCTION BETTER. AS OUR CLIMATE CHANGES AND OBVIOUSLY PARTY ANSWER ALL THIS STUFF IS TO. MITIGATE REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF CARBON WITH PUTTING THE ATMOSPHERE THAT THAT GETS ABSORBED. BUT WERE. GETTING KIND OF PASS THAT AND WE NOW NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS AND BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT WE DO? AND AND WHAT'S NEXT AND THAT'S WHY THIS IS ALL VERY FOUNDATIONAL AND. AND REALLY IMPORTANT. SO MOST OF IT. WELL ABOVE MY HEAD BUT THANK YOU FOR. BEING HERE PRESENTING AND HELPING US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. SO NEXT UP I WOULD TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE. ON ANY OF THIS. ALRIGHT. SEEING NONE I'M GOING TO WRAP UP AND TO GO BACK TO WHERE I STARTED WHAT WE DO WHAT'S MY NEXT BELT. OR ANYBODY HERE. ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES IT'S WE DO OUR BEST WORK BY TAKING A DEEP BREATH. ALLOWING SCIENCE TO DO ITS WORK AND THEN FIGURING OUT WHAT OUR NEXT STEPS ARE IN COLLABORATION WITH THE INDUSTRY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION WITH THE SCIENTISTS WHO ARE OUT THERE. THAT'S REALLY WHAT I'M HOPING WE GET OUT OF THIS IS IS A BEGINNING. THERE'S A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE WE NEED TO GO AND THEN AS WE SEEK SOLUTIONS WEATHERS RESTORING KELP BEDS. DEVELOPING AQUACULTURE TARGETING DEVELOPMENTS WERE TARGETING RESTORATIONS AND AND THINGS IT THAT THAT IS IS WHAT I THINK IS ULTIMATELY. BENEFICIAL SO APPRECIATE YOU ALL BEING HERE TODAY VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT THE CONVERSATION AND THAT THE INPUT INTO OUR PROCESSESHERE. THIS I HOPE WILL BE BY NOW IT'S GONNA BE AN ONGOING CONVERSATION BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE ALL WORKING ON AN ONGOING BASIS. BUT IF THERE ARE AND FOR ANYONE WATCHING ANYONE ENGAGED IN THIS IF THERE ARE BETTER WAYS THAT WE. AS THE LEGISLATURE HAS ADMINISTRATION AS AS GOVERNMENTS FOR CALIFORNIA CAN AND SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THESE ISSUES STEPS WE SHOULD BE TAKING HOW WE CAN BE SMARTER. ABOUT BRINGING FACILITATING ALL THESE COLLABORATIONS AND YES WE NEED TO BE FUNDING SOME OF THIS NO THAT THAT'S AN INHERENT QUESTION IN ALL OF THIS. AND ENSURING BECAUSE THOSE ARE INVESTMENTS REALLY IN OUR FUTURE AND IN OUR FUTURE ABILITY TO MANAGE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA. SO THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE GREAT PANELS GREAT INFORMATION. AND MOST THIS INFORMATION I THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO PUT UP ON THE. SELECT COMMITTEES WEBSITE SO THAT IT WILL BE OUT THERE WE WILL HAVE A VIDEO RECORDING OF THIS THAT WE CAN THEN LOOK AT REFER BACK TO. WHEN WE ARE TAKING NEXT STEP SO. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. AND WITH THAT. ALRIGHT WE'RE ADJOURNED
