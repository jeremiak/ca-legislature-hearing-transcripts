IS AND THAT- MAKES IT- IT CLARIFIES AS THE BILL HAD RICH INTO THAT THE MISSED- BY A SURPRISE MY BE S. FOR. THANK YOU SAYS SKINNER- SO HERE YOU THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU- POLITIES JUST CRACKING SOMETHING THE MOST TO BE- MEMBERS SOME VERY VERY PLEASE TO PRESENT SB SIX. YES SIXTEEN IS THE ENTER. OF A BILL S. SO. SEVEN SIX WHICH- WAS- MIND LAST YEAR IN WHICH WAS APPROVED BY THE ASSEMBLY WITH A- I DON'T HAVE THE PHONE FOR ME BUT FOR. FIFTY OR HIGHER ON THE LAST OF SESSION BUT DUE TO THE MITTEN DEADLINE THAT WE FACED. ONCE IT GOT OVER TO THE SENATE WE RAN OUT OF TIME TO TAKE IT UP. SO WE BRING IT BACK WITH THE HOPES THAT WE ARE DON'T HIT THAT MIDNIGHT. AS WE DID LAST YEAR. BUT WHAT SB SIXTEEN DOES IS BUILD UPON. THE BILL I DIDN'T TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHICH THE LEGISLATURE PASSED IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED INTO LAW. WHICH WAS SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE AND THAT BILL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FORTY YEARS OPENED CALIFORNIA'S COMPLETE BLOCK. ON ANY PUBLIC ACCESS TO. POLICE RECORDS. THAT THAT BLOCK OR THAT- IT ABILITY TO ACCESS. RECORDS EVEN INCLUDED A CHIEF OF POLICE COULD NOT GET RECORDS ON. A AN OFFICER THAT THEY WERE CONSIDERING FOR HIGHER. THEY COULD THERE WAS ONLY LIMITED THINGS THAT THEY COULD EVEN GET SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THAT PARTICULAR OFFICER ANY NO OTHER AGENCY HAD A HISTORY OF COMPLAINTS OR MISCONDUCT IN A CERTAIN SET OF THINGS. THE NEW HIRING AGENCY WOULD NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE RECORDS- SO. THE I INDICATED TWENTY ONE WAS PASSED AND IT OPENED UP ACCESS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FORTY YEARS TO A LIMITED SET OF RECORDS. THOSE RECORDS BEING SPECIFICALLY PROVEN SEXUAL ASSAULT ON THE JOBS IN OTHER WORDS AND IF AN OFFICER COMMITTED SEXUAL ASSAULT ON THE JOB. SECONDLY DISHONESTY INVOLVING INTERFERING WITH A WITNESS FOR TAMPERING EVIDENCE. AND THIRDLY DISCHARGING A FIREARM OR USE OF FORCE SO THOSE WERE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE NOW HAVE ACCESS WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS ADD A FEW OTHER CATEGORIES AND THE PRINCIPLE OF WHICH IS THAT. LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE EFFECTIVE MUST HAVE THE TRUST OF THE COMMUNITY IT SERVES AND WHEN THE COMMUNITY FEELS LIKE WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT OUR OFFICERS AND IF WE MAKE CERTAIN COMPLAINTS WE HAVE NO IDEA IF THOSE COMPLAINTS ARE EVER INVESTIGATED WORK THE OFFICERS EVER HELD ACCOUNTABLE. SO THE ADDITION THAT I WILL BE PRESENTED TO NOW ARE ADDITIONS THAT MOST PEOPLE FEEL ARE VERY READ THING THAT ALL OF US DESERVED KNOW ABOUT THE OFFICER THAT SIR. SO THE ADDITIONAL RECORDS THERE ARE SIX DAD'S ARE GETTING SPEAKING ACCESS TO USE FORCE SOME OF THE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO GET A WORK ON SO. FINDING OF HENRI- USE OF FORCE. IT ALSO PROVIDES IF NORTH OFFICER HAS A HIS OF. BIASED OR DISK. ACTS AND AGAIN SYSTEM. WE WOULD HAVE TO THOSE. THAT IF THEY HAD A HISTORY OF CONDUCT A LOS ARREST SEARCH. AND- IN ANOTHER COUNTY OF DISHONESTY. SO ALL OF THESE MUST BE SUSTAINED FINDINGS- THE LAST THING THAT THE BILL DOES. IS IT ENSURES THAT. IF AN OFFICER QUITS THEIR JOB LET'S SAY THERE'S A SET OF COMPLAINTS BROUGHT AGAINST THEM AND THE AGENCY HAS JUST OPENED AN INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN COMPLETED AND THE OFFICER CHOOSES TO AVOID. HAVING THE COMPLETE LOOKED INTO TO LEAVE THE JOB. THAT A NOTHER HIRING AGENCY BEEN CONSIDERING THE HIRING OF THAT OFFICER CAN CAN AND WOULD REQUEST FROM THE PREVIOUS AGENCY ALL RECORDS RELATED TO THAT OFFICER. SO WE DON'T HAVE A SITUATION WHERE OFFICERS ARE JUST QUITTING IT JUMPING OFF TO ANOTHER FORCE TO AVOID HAVING THEIR MISCONDUCT EVER REVEALED. SO THIS PROTECTS ALL OF US IT PROTECTS OUR AGENCIES SO THAT THEY KNOW WHO THEY'RE HIRING. SO THAT'S WHAT THE BILL DOES SPOKE SKEWS ME THERE'S ONE OTHER COMPONENT AND THAT IS ONCE FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE PASSED MOST JURISDICTIONS AND AGENCIES COMPLIED WITH THE LAW IN RELEASED THE RECORDS AS THE BILL WRECKED. IT IN FORCE- REQUIRED. HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME AGENCIES WHO WANTED TO HEAR DIRECTOR FEED FOR DOOR OR CREATE OBSTACLES AND SOME OF THE OBSTACLES THAT THEY CREATED WERE TO CHARGE OUT REGIS PRICES FOR THE REQUEST FOR TO GET RECORDS. THERE WAS ONE PARTICULAR JURISDICTION IT TRIED TO CHARGE A FAMILY SOME AT THAT THE INITIAL BILL WAS THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE REAP RECORDS THAT THEY REQUESTED. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS CLARIFY THEY CAN ONLY CHARGE FOR THE COPYING JUST LIKE OUR PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUIRES. AND THAT THEY MUST RESPOND IN A TIMELY MANNER AND IF THEY DO NOT RESPOND IN A TIMELY MANNER THERE'S THE ABILITY TO TAKE TO CHALLENGE THAT IN COURT AND FOR THERE TO BE FEES OR FINES LEVIED. BOB BASED ON THEIR REFUSAL TO COMPLY. WITH THE LAW. FOR PETER RICH BILL SB HOURS YES FOR TWENTY WAS QUITE CAN EVERY ENFORCEMENT OF. THIS BILL SB SIXTY SO LET YEAR'S SEVENTEEN SIX I WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR MAJOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES LIKE ARE YOU ENTITIES LIKE CORRECT. AND MADE SURE THAT ALL OF THE RECORDS HERE WERE SUSTAIN FINDINGS AND ADDRESSED OTHER CONCERNS THEY HAD SO I'M VERY PROUD TO SAY THAT POOR ACT FOR EXAMPLE IS NEUTRAL ON THIS BILL. THERE ARE SOME OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THAT STILL DON'T LIKE THIS BILL BUT IS NOT NEAR AS CONTENTIOUS AS FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE WAS. FOUND WITH THAT HI- WOULD GO TO MY MAIN WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER- I BELIEVE WE HAVE- A NATASHA MINSKER WITH SMART JUSTICE AND SAFEST JOHNSON WITH CALIFORNIA'S FAMILIES UNITED FOR JUSTICE- ON THE PHONE LINE SO. IF WE MIGHT START WITH A- MISS MINSKER. GOOD AFTERNOON SB SIXTEEN IS A MODEST PROPOSAL THAT PRIMARILY ADDRESSES THE PROBLEMS FAMILY MEMBERS AND THE PUBLIC HAVE ENCOUNTERED ACCESSING CONDUCT RECORD. FOR FORTY YEARS RECORD COULD NOT CONDUCT BY POLICE THE KEPT SECRET AND HIDDEN FROM THE PUBLIC. BETTER SKINNER BUILDERS THE PUBLIC RIGHT TO KNOW. ABOUT HONDA BY. ANY FAMILY MEMBERS RECORDERS IN MEMBER OF THE- REQUESTED WRECKED. AND IMMEDIATE THEY ENCOUNTERED CURIOUS WROCLAW. DEPARTMENT DESTROYED I THINK OUR PERMITTED TO DO UNDER LAW. BERMAN FUTURE TURNING PRIVILEGE READ. ABOUT STATEMENTS FROM WITNESSES. SAM WERE CHARGED OUT OF DOLLARS FOR FEES FOR RECORD STORED IN A DIGITAL. THAT CAN BE DUPLICATED WITH A FEW KEY. OFTEN- RESIGNED TO BLOCK THIS MERGER OF RECORD AND APART THE WAY JUST FOR MONEY EVEN MORE THAN A YEAR BECAUSE THERE'S NO ONE WAY TO ENFORCE THE FOR THE IN HER LAW. TO UNDERSTANDING OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM AND BUILDING TRUST BETWEEN COMMUNITIES AND POLICE. THIS INCLUDES SUSTAIN COMPLAINTS OF PREJUDICE AND BIAS BY POLICE. THE SAME COMPLAINTS OF ILLEGAL SEARCHES ARE AT. ON USE OF FORCE BY THE POLICE THIS IS CRITICAL INFORMATION FOR THE PUBLIC TO KNOW HOW THE POLICE DEPARTMENT OR TAKING MISCONDUCT COMPLAINT SERIOUSLY AND OFTEN OFFICERS HAVE A PATTERN OF MISCONDUCT. SB SIXTEEN IS A MODEST PROPOSAL THAT WILL ENSURE THE PUBLIC HAS MEANINGFUL ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION IS NEEDED AND IT WILL HELP BUILD TRUST BETWEEN POLICE AND COMMUNITY.

IT'S FAIR INJURY SEXUAL SAW SEXUALLY ASSAULTED SOMEONE FOR LIFE ON THE JOB HAVE BEEN KEPT SECRET FOR FORTY YEARS. UNTIL TWENTY NINETEEN WHEN SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE OR TWELVE BACK. A PENSION OF SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE CRACKED THE DOOR OPEN. TRANSPARENCY HOWEVER NOT WITHOUT BLATANT PUSH BACK FROM POLICING THEY JUST TO DROP THE STATE. THANKS TO THE CALIFORNIA COURTS THE RULING IN OUR FAVOR. NOW IN THIS TIME OF RECKONING WHICH IS A CRITICAL TIME FOR CALIFORNIA POLICING AGENCIES TO BUILD TRUST WITH THE COMMUNITY THEY SERVE. WE CAN CLOSE LOOPHOLES TO REAL TRANSPARENCY WITH SB SIXTEEN. SB SIXTEEN WILL GRANT ACCESS TO RECORDS ABOUT POLICE OFFICERS WHO ENGAGE IN BIASED OR DISCRIMINATORY BEHAVIOR OR USE THAT PHONE. FOR A REASONABLE FOR. IT WOULD ALSO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR AGENCIES AND INDIVIDUAL OFFICERS TO MANEUVER AROUND THE DISCLOSURE REQUIRED BY IT THE FOURTEENTH TWENTY ONE. THE FOURTEENTH TWENTY ONE FOCUSED ON COMPLETED INVESTIGATION. SB SIXTEEN WILL MAKE RECORDS PUBLIC IF THE INTERNAL CARE BEST ADDITION POTENTIAL MISCONDUCT HAD BEEN COMPLETED BY THE TIME THE OFFICER.

SO WELL I CAN'T GUARANTEE IT I CERTAINLY WILL WORK ON IT- I WANTED TO HAVE- JUST IN MY CLOTHES REFERENCE THAT EVEN WITH THE EXPANSION THAT THIS BILL DOES THE NEW CATEGORIES OF RECORDS THAT WE WOULD BE ENTITLED TO IT STILL LEAVES CALIFORNIA AND OUT LIAR COMPARED TO MANY OTHER STATES FOR EXAMPLE NEW YORK ALL RECORDS RELATED TO POLICE OFFICER ACTION ALL ARE NOW ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC LEGALLY. GEORGIA OHIO FLORIDA KENTUCKY WASHINGTON HAVE VERY FEW RESTRICTIONS ON WHAT RECORDS THE PUBLIC CAN ACCESS CAL AS I'VE INDICATED CALIFORNIA IS STILL AN OUTLIER ADDITIONALLY THE EXPANSION ON THE CATEGORIES OF USE OF FORCE THAT THIS BILL ALLOWS ARE VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE- UNDER. UNDER CURRENT LAW. THE ONLY KINDS OF USE OF FORCE THAT WE COULD GET X. ACCESS TO ARE THOSE THAT WOULD BE DEFINED AS DEADLY NOW IF WE TAKE CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN FOR EXAMPLE WHO IS UNDER TRIAL NOW. D. WHAT'S COME OUT IN THE PRESS IS THAT THEIR JOB AND HAD A HISTORY. OF VARIOUS USE OF FORCE. PAST ALLEGATIONS NONE OF WHICH RESULTED THAT I'M AWARE OF ANY DEATHS. THE NONE THAT WERE CHARACTERIZED AS DEADLY SO IN OTHER WORDS WE WOULD NOT WE NOR THE POLICE AGENCY IN IN- HIRING DIRECTOR OF AN FOR EXAMPLE WE WOULD NOT KNOW. HAVE ANY ACCESS TO HIS PAST RECORD OF THE TYPES OF USE OF FORCE THAT IS NOW BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT HE WOULD. VERY COMMONLY USED. WHAT SB SIXTEEN DOES IS GIVE US THE ABILITY TO SEE WHEN AN OFFICER HAS SUSTAINED FINDINGS OF EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE- AND WITH THAT. I HOPE THAT YOU WOULD GIVE ME- I THOUGHT. I WAS GONNA- SIR MOTION SIR THE RUSSELL MOST OF. SB SIXTEEN BANSHEE COUNSEL IF YOU WOULD CALL THE ROLL.

THREE NINE SEVEN WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS- OUTSIDE THE USUAL PROTOCOL. SB THREE NINE SEVEN IS GOING TO BE TAKEN OUT OF ORDER AFTER THREE O'CLOCK SO WHATEVER BILLS BEING PRESENTED THREE O'CLOCK WE'RE GONNA CONCLUDE THAT BILL AND NEVER GONNA TAKE UP SB THREE NINETY SEVEN. AFTER THAT BILL CONCLUDES- THAT'S TO THE BENEFIT OF THOSE WHO ARE ON THE PHONE MAYBE SOME OF THOSE WHO ARE WAITING HERE IN THE CAPITAL JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME- DEFINITION AS TO WHAT WE THINK THE AFTERNOON HOLDS IN TERMS OF. TIME AND PROCESS. ALL RIGHT- CENTER PAN THANK YOU FOR WAITING. SB SEVENTEEN THANK YOU CHAIR ON BURGER SENATORS- I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT SB SEVENTEEN WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH AN OFFICE OF RACIAL EQUITY AND RACIAL EQUITY ADVISED ACCOUNTABILITY COUNCIL IN ORDER TO ADDRESS SYSTEMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL RACISM HAS RESULTED IN POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES AND DISPARITIES% IN THE STATE. I DO WANT TO THANK YOUR STAFF HERE DISHER COMMITTEE YOU I THINK DID AN EXCELLENT- SUMMARY AND WRITE UP OF THE ISSUES THAT THIS BILL IS- TRYING TO ADDRESS THE LONG HISTORY OF- RACISM AND DISPARITIES THAT WE'VE SEEN AND NOT ONLY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT ACROSS OUR COUNTRY AND THIS BILL IS LONG OVERDUE AND AS A DOWN PAYMENT TOWARDS STATE PLAYING A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN DISMANTLING OVER THREE HUNDRED YEARS OF RACIAL INEQUALITIES. IN ENDING SYSTEMIC RACISM CENTER RESEARCH IDENTIFIED RACISM IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS LEADING TO SIGNIFICANT HEALTH DISPARITIES INCLUDING INFANT MATERNAL MORTALITY CRISIS HE'S PREVALENCE LIFE EXPECTANCY AND NOW COBIT MORTALITY. AND WELL OUR STATE HAS MADE EFFORTS TECHNOLOGY CONFRONT RACIAL DISPARITIES IN RECENT YEARS EQUITY IS OFTEN BEEN TREATED AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT OR IS A SILENT STRATEGY IT IS NOT ENOUGH JUST TO DECLARE RACISM AS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THE STATE NEEDS AN INDEPENDENT BODY TO HOLD US ACCOUNTABLE BY EXAMINIG CALIFORNIA'S POLICIES AND BUDGET WITH THE GOAL OF ACHIEVING RACIAL EQUITY AND ENDING SYSTEMIC RACISM. THIS BILL WOULD ESTABLISH AN OFFICE OF RACIAL EQUITY TO LEAD THIS WORK IN A POWER TO STATE TO IMPLEMENT IMPLEMENT RACIAL EQUITY FRAMEWORK SB SEVENTEEN IS SPONSORED BY THE ADVANCE PARTY CALIFORNIA. COMMITTEE COALITION GREEN LINING INSTITUTE NEXT GEN POLICY PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES AND SEIU STATE COUNCIL AND IS SUPPORTED BY A WIDE ARRAY OF STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING LABOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT ADVOCATES COMMUNITIES ORGANIZATIONS HEALTH PROVIDERS AND PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS THE STATE ANALYSIS HI HAVE AMENDMENTS TO MAKE TECHNICAL IN CLARIFYING CHANGES AND ADD CO AUTHORS EXPECT WE ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS B. SEVENTEEN AND IN SUPPORT I DO HAVE TWO WITNESSES WHO I BELIEVE ARE IN THE GALLERY. DANIELLE. LAFAYETTE COMMITTEE MEMBER OF THE- AND JAKE AT PAUL ADVISER WITH COMING BURKE AND BURLING. HE ON BEHALF OF THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR PAN IF OF MR LEVINE IS HERE IF I WOULD ASK. THAT HE MOVED TO THE MICROPHONE. IN NO NO WITH DANIELLE LEFT YET AS WELL I SEE MR LEVINE AND IF MISS OF LAFAYETTE IS HERE IF SHE WOULD MOVE TOWARD THE MICROPHONE AS WELL. BUT INSTEAD OF PAYING THE EXCEPT THE AMENDMENTS AS PROPOSED YES THANK THANK YOU. HI THIS LEVINE THE FLOOR IS YOURS TWO MINUTES CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. I AM HONORED TO SPEAK TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB SEVENTEEN AS AN ATTORNEY REPRESENTING THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE ONE OF THE BILL'S LEAD SPONSORS. CALIFORNIA IS KNOWN WORLDWIDE AS A LAND OF OPPORTUNITY FROM HAVING THROWN OPEN ITS DOORS TO FREE SPIRITS AND ENTREPRENEURS TO BEING A WELCOMING HOME TO THOSE WHO ARE DIFFERENT. BUT THE STATE ALSO HAS A DARKER AND EQUALLY LONG HISTORY OF PERPETUATING DEEP RACIAL AND ETHNIC INEQUITIES THAT PERSIST TODAY. TAKEOVER NINETEEN FOR BUT ONE RECENT EXAMPLE THE VIRUS HAS LAID BARE INEXCUSABLE AND I'M JUST DISPARITIES AND INEQUITIES IN ACCESS TO BASIC RIGHTS SUCH AS CLEAN AIR AND SAFE HOUSING. ATTORNEYS OF COLOR DISPROPORTIONATELY EXPOSED TO AIR POLLUTION AND DISPROPORTIONATELY BEARING THE BURDEN OF UNAFFORDABLE HOUSING HAVE BEEN MORE VULNERABLE TO RESPIRATORY DISEASE PREYED ON FAMILIES IN THEIR HOMES AND THEIR CENTRAL JOBS. BUT EVEN AS WE ACKNOWLEDGE THOSE INJUSTICES WE'LL OUT OF VACCINE ROLLOUT TO OSSIFIED THEM FURTHER FOR EXAMPLE QUALITY NO CALIFORNIANS HAVE SUFFERED 47% OF COVERT NINETEEN DEATHS. THEY HAVE ONLY RECEIVED 23% OF THE VACCINATIONS THESE BURDENS HARDLY A COMPREHENSIVE ACCOUNTING HAVE ALSO COMPOUNDED THE WEALTH GAP THAT EXISTS BETWEEN WHITE CALIFORNIANS AND CALIFORNIANS OF COLOR. THESE RACIAL INEQUITIES ARE NOT SPONTANEOUS THEY'RE THE PRODUCTS OF DECADES OF GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT HAVE BOTH FAILED TO ADDRESS THEM AND HAVE AFFIRMATIVELY ADVANCED AND- NOW GOVERNMENT HAS A CRUCIAL RESPONSIBILITY TO LEAD THE REPAIR. THAT IS THE WORK THAT SB SEVENTEEN BEGINS IT PROVIDES A THOUGHTFUL STRUCTURE FOR GOVERNMENT TO IDENTIFY SOLVE FOR AND ULTIMATELY DISMANTLE RACIAL INEQUITY. SB SEVENTEEN ESTABLISHES THE OFFICE OF RACIAL EQUITY IT WOULD CREATE AN INNOVATIVE COMMUNITY DRIVEN FRAMEWORK AND A COORDINATED APPROACH AMONG STATE AGENCIES TO PROMOTE EQUITABLE OUTCOMES AND TO USE DATA TO EVALUATE ITS OWN PROGRESS. AS WE CONFRONT THE FULL SCOPE OF RACIAL DISPARITIES AND INEQUITIES BY POCK CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCE ON A DAILY BASIS THIS BILL IS A COMMITMENT TO GUARD AGAINST THEM AND TO REVERSE THEM. I WOULD BE PLEASED TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE AND I APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU MR. LEVINE MISS LAFAYETTE. I SEE MISS LAFAYETTE MOVING TO THE MICROPHONE. FLOOR'S YOURS WAS LAFAYETTE. HELLO MY NAME IS DANIELLE LAFAYETTE AND I'M A RESIDENT OF SOUTH LOS ANGELES THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT MY TO EXPRESS MY SUPPORT OF SB SEVENTEEN DESPITE HOW MEDIA PORTRAYS THROUGHOUT THE LATE WE ARE GREAT AND FAMILY CENTER COMMUNITY I'M A GRASSROOTS LEADER WITH COMMUNITY COALITION A SOCIAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATION ANKLES PROCTOR SB SEVENTY.

HE ALSO CAME BACK TO A WAR ZONE WITHIN HIS OWN BACKYARD BECAUSE OF THE RACIST POLICIES AND PRACTICES LIKE THE WAR ON DRUGS. REDLINING AND EDUCATIONAL SEGREGATION. OUR FAMILIES HAVE BEEN TORN APART BY THE MOST BY THE SORRY OUR FAMILIES HAVE BEEN TORN APART BY THE MILITARIZATION OF OUR POLICE FORCE WE ARE HOME TO ONE OF THE HIGHEST HOMELESS POPULATION TO THE STATE. MOST OF US ARE SUFFERING FROM TRAUMA AND CHRONIC STRESS. MY FATHER EXPERIENCED ALL THESE CONDITIONS WHILE ALSO SUFFERING FROM PTSD BECAUSE OF THE WAR. MY DAD HAD A CHANCE TO REACH ITS FULL POTENTIAL HE WAS ACCEPTED INTO AN ELITE UNIVERSITY BUT ITS POTENTIAL BLESSED MAX WITH WITH THE RESOURCES HE NEEDED TO SUCCEED DUE TO RACIST POLICIES. INSTEAD HE WAS REPEATEDLY MET WITH THE JAIL CELL FEDERAL O MERELY PASSED AWAY. MY FAMILY I LIVE WITHOUT HER EVERY DAY. I AM ALSO HERE MY SO. BECAUSE I WANT THEM TO HAVE A BRIGHT FUTURE THAT I KNOW THEY ARE CAPABLE OF GET OUR SCHOOLS. CONTINUE TO UNDER CONTINUE TO BE UNDER FUNDED CRIMINALIZE BLACK CHILDREN ESPECIALLY OUR BOYS AS A DAUGHTER AND AS A MOTHER THIS IS EXHAUSTING AND UNFAIR. I AM TIRED OF CONSTANTLY FIGHTING AGAINST AND EXPERIENCING RACISM. CALL THE NINETEEN HAS ONLY MADE RACIAL INEQUALITY MORE APPARENT AND WORSE.

UNDER EXISTING LAW THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH A CONTRACTOR WHO FAILS TO USE THOSE SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE. HOWEVER UNDER SB FORTY FOUR WITH A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT. THESE PROJECTS ARE EXEMPT FROM THESE PENALTIES WE THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE A LEVEL PLAYING GROUND FOR ENFORCEMENT OF SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE. AND THE PENALTY SHOULD APPLY IRRESPECTIVE OF THE EXISTENCE OF A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT. LIKEWISE AND POTENTIALLY MORE CONCERNING FOR MEMBERS OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. UNDER PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT ON AN SB FORTY FOUR PROJECT. THE LABOR COMMISSIONER IS PROHIBITED FROM ENFORCING WAGE AND HOUR RULES. THAT ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO THE PROTECTION OF WORKERS ON CONSTRUCTION JOBS IN FACT. THE KEY ADMINISTRATIVE SUBMITTAL THAT IS USED BY PUBLIC AGENCIES AND THE LABOR COMMISSIONER AND OTHERS TO VERIFY THAT THE CORRECT WAGES AND BENEFITS HAVE BEEN PAID WHICH ARE SUBMITTED UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY. CONTRACTORS UNDER APPEAL A ADDRESS BEFORE THE FIVE OR SB FORTY FOUR EXCUSE ME. DON'T HAVE TO KEEP A CERTIFIED PAYROLL RECORDS IN ADDITION TO DENYING THE LABOR COMMISSIONER ACCESS TO ENFORCE THE LABOR CODE. WE THINK THAT SB FORTY FOUR- IS A- A VALUABLE ADDITION FOR.

SET HIM AND PICK ONE OR THE OTHER- SO I WOULD I GUESS IT'S MORE OF A ADVICE IS THAT I WOULD ASK THE AUTHOR CHOOSE ONE TO TWO SO THAT IT SAYS THAT ALL EVERYBODY IN THE GAME KNOWS WHAT IT IS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT IF YOU LIKE TO RESPOND AS CLOSE BUT- THAT'S- A CONTINUING PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE. THANK YOU. CENTER CABALLERO. YOU MISTER CHAIR- I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY A FEW WORDS I MEAN TO SAY THAT I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO BE. ADDED AS A AS A CO AUTHOR BUT- I HAVE BEEN HAVING SAID THAT- I'VE BEEN TRYING TO AS THE AUTHOR KNOWS TRYING TO DO- SOME- SEQUEL REFORM AROUND THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND IN PARTICULAR IN- VERY POOR NEIGHBORHOODS AND I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO IT MOSTLY BECAUSE- THE L. A. DELEGATION AND IN THE ASSEMBLY. DOESN'T LIKE SYKORA STREAMLINING OR OR OR OR- THE EXPEDITED JUDICIAL REVIEW- GIVEN THAT THIS IS FOR L. A. AND MY GUESS IS THEY'LL TAKE A VERY DIFFERENT VIEW OF IT IN AND OUT THERE WILL BE A PROBLEM BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THAT- I THINK THAT. THIS IS A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF THE SEQUOIA- MODIFICATION THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER- I ON A BROADER BASIS WHAT CAN BE BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THAN FOR US TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR VEHICLES TRANSPORTATION. AND TO DO IT IN OUR URBAN CENTERS IS EXACTLY WHERE IT SHOULD BE DONE. AND SO IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT WE HAD A WE HAD A LOOK AT THIS- AND INSTEAD OF AN EXPEDITED JUDICIAL REVIEW WE SHOULD LOOK AT IT AS AN ARM AND AN EXPEDITED JUDICIAL- EXPEDITED SECRET PROCESS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- AND- I. HAVE BEEN HAVING SOME CONVERSATIONS WITH ONE OF THE- ONE OF THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAS. CREATED MOST OF THE SEQUEL LITIGATION IN IN MY REGION AND THEY SEE IT THIS WAY TOO THEY THEY HAVE FINALLY- SEEN THE LIGHT AND THEY'RE INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT WAYS THAT WE CAN WE CAN NOT CHANGE HOW WE DO SECRET BECAUSE INITIALLY IN THIS IS. I WASN'T AROUND WHEN SEAT BUT WAS WAS PROPOSED AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF IT- BUT IT'S BEEN MISUSED- IT WAS. BUT NATURAL ENVIRONMENT IT WAS WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO BE DOING CONSTRUCTION. JEX IN ON LAND THAT HAD NOT BEEN. DISTURBED FOR A CONSTRUCTION PROJECT IN SO IN ANY CASE I JUST WANTED TO- TO MAKE MY WITH MY TWO CENTS WORTH IT'S A FRUSTRATION OF MINE WE ABSOLUTELY NEED AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I'M GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK ON. ON WAYS TO BE ABLE TO GET IT DONE BUT THIS THIS IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE A RIPE AREA FOR- SOME DISCUSSION IN ANY WAY THAT I CAN BE HELPFUL I WANT TO BE THERE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU CENTER CABALLERO- SEVERAL BOARD JUST SAY NO YOUR MICROPHONES UP CENTER BOARD JUST THANK YOU FOR CHAIRING THE COMMITTEE IN MY ABSENCE YEAR COMPENSATION WILL BE. APPROPRIATELY INCREASED. WITH THAT CHAIR PAY FOR VOICE ABOUT TEARS DON'T GET PAID ANYTHING EXTRA ANYWAY CENTRAL. I MUST SAY- TERM IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK WE HAD SOME. UNUSUAL SERIES OF A DISTURBANCE IS BUT LIKE ALWAYS WE GET THROUGH THEM- I KIND OF WONDERFUL ON A COMMENT THAT WAS. I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS MR PIMENTEL OR MISTER TURNER. ONE OF THIS AND TO WONDER THE TO SUPPORT WITNESSES- ONE OF THE INDIVIDUALS MADE A COMMENT THAT SEACOR IS MISUSED IT IT FACILITATES LAWSUITS IN CAN CREATE SOME UNNECESSARY DELAYS. IN NOT TO OVERSTATE THE OBVIOUS BUT I THINK THOSE ARE THE TRUISMS THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHERE THEY'RE DEALING WITH A TRANSPORTATION PROJECT OR THEIR CITY OR COUNTY EMPLOYEES DEALING WITH LAND USE. SO I'VE ALWAYS BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR DESIRE TO FIND WAYS TO MAKE SEEK WHAT WORK MORE EFFICIENTLY AND MORE EFFECTIVELY MORE TRANSPARENTLY. I THINK AT SOME POINT IN TIME WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO ALSO AGAIN HAVE THE COURAGE TO DEAL DIRECTLY WITH- THE UNDERLYING LEGISLATION AND NOT NECESSARILY JUST ALWAYS WORKING AROUND IT. BUT WITH THAT I'M GOING TO BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOUR LEGISLATION BECAUSE I THINK. IT IS. IT IS IN. I THINK WE'VE A POLTERGEIST% IN THIS BUILDING. THERE'S A LOOK AT IT WITH A BUT I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT ON THIS- THIS BILL MOVING FORWARD TODAY AND LOOK FORWARD TO OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE SINGLE WORK FOR THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU CENTER BOARD IS A SINGLE OTHER MICROPHONES- SURROUNDED LIKE CLOSE. TO PROCEED THE COMMENTS AND- SO WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU AT YOUR END OF THE DAY THIS IS THIS IS. YEAH I APPRECIATE CENTER COPIERS COMMENTS ESPECIALLY AT YEAH WHAT WHAT COULD BE GREENER. THAN GETTING MORE. TRANSIT PROJECTS ONLINE FOR PEOPLE TO GET AROUND TOWN. ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IN A SAFE AFFORDABLE CLEAN MANNER- IT'S IMPORTANT FOR OUR PREPARATIONS FOR THE OLYMPICS BUT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE. UP AND DOWN THE STATE- WE EVERY TIME I GO YOU KNOW OF OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD I I'M JUST. SOMETIMES SADDENED BY HOW MUCH BETTER THEIR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS ARE- WE GOT A LOT OF CONSTRUCTION WE WANT WE WANT TO BUILD OUT OUR OUR INFRASTRUCTURE HERE.

THANK YOU SEVEN JONES ROAD YEARS THANK YOU THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SENATE BILL THREE NINETY SEVEN ESTABLISHES. THE RELIGION IS ESSENTIAL ACT. IN SUPREME JUST. ON TEN VERSUS NEWSOME LIBERAL JUSTICES STARTED THEIR DESCENT BY STATING. QUOTE THE FIRST AMENDMENT REQUIRES THAT A STATE TREAT RELIGIOUS CONDUCT AS WELL AS THE STATE TREATS COMPATIBLE SECULAR CONDUCT IN QUOTE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES REQUIRE THE STATE TO TREAT RELIGION AS THE SAME AS ANY SECULAR ESSENTIAL SERVICE. THIS BILL UPHOLDS THE RIGHT TO WORSHIP WITH FELLOW BELIEVERS ANY CHOSEN HOUSE OF WORSHIP AS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF LIFE. WHERE DO YOU GO TO CHURCH SYNAGOGUE TEMPLE SHRINE MOSQUE OR ANY OTHER RELIGIOUS SERVICE YOU GO TO SHARE YOUR BELIEFS VALUES AND LOVE OF LIFE WITH YOUR FELLOW PRACTITIONERS AND YOUR FAITH LEADERS. PRACTICING A RELIGION IS SOMETHING THAT CROSSES ALL PARTY LINES RACIAL IDENTITIES DEMOGRAPHICS CULTURES AND LIFESTYLES. YOU'LL FIND HOUSES OF WORSHIP IN THE MOST POVERTY STRICKEN NEIGHBORHOODS OF CALIFORNIA AND YOU'LL FIND THEM IN THE WEALTHIEST ENCLAVES OF OUR STATE. YOU'LL FIND THEM IN DOWNTOWN URBAN CENTERS AND YOU WILL FIND THEM IN MIDDLE OF FARM COUNTRY IN THE SUBURBS AND IN THE INNER CITIES YOU WILL FIND THEM. EVERYWHERE TAKING AWAY THE RIGHT TO ATTEND YOUR CHOSEN HOUSE OF WORSHIP TO PRACTICE WHATEVER RELIGION YOU BELIEVE IN. AND TO SHARE THAT EXPERIENCE WITH YOUR FAMILY FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS NEGATIVELY IMPACTS PEOPLE OF EVERY WALK OF LIFE. IN OUR STATE. TODAY WE WILL SHARE TESTIMONY FROM TWO OUTSTANDING SCHOLARS FOCUSING ON THE BASIC PREMISE. THAT RELIGION IS ESSENTIAL. NOT JUST FOR OUR SPIRITUAL WELL BEING BUT ALSO FOR OUR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. YOU WILL ALSO HEAR THAT OUR GOVERNMENT THROUGH ITS ACTIONS HAS ENTRUSTED OUR LIVES IN SAFETY TO LARGE RETAIL CORPORATIONS. YET THAT SAME GOVERNMENT HAS REFUSED TO TRUST FAITH LEADERS TO PROTECT US. MEMBERS IF WE TRUST THE CEOS AND MANAGERS OF BIG BOX STORES TO ENSURE WE SOCIALLY DISTANCE IN THEIR STORES. AND WHY WOULD WE NOT TRUST THE RABBIS IMAMS PRIESTS AND PASTORS. SURE WE SOCIALLY DISTANCE IN OUR HOUSES OF WORSHIP. I'M HONORED TO HAVE TWO WITNESSES ON THE LINE TODAY WILL BE FOLLOWED BY AS MANY INDIVIDUAL SUPPORTERS BOTH HERE IN THE CAPITAL AND ON THE PHONE LINE. THAT MADE TIME TODAY FOR THIS IMPORTANT BILL. FIRST YOU'LL HAVE DOCTOR J. BHATTACHARYA AN MD AND PHD IN IN ECONOMICS. WHO IS A PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AT THE STANFORD UNIVERSITY AND A RESEARCH ASSOCIATE AT THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMICS RESEARCH. THEY WILL HAVE A GREAT SHOP IN THE LEGAL COUNSEL FOR THE ALLIANCE DEFENDING FREEDOM. A CENTER OF LEGISLATIVE ADVOCACY. MR NOT SURE WE'RE READY FOR THAT WITNESSES IF YOU ARE THANK YOU SENATE JONES IS- DR PADA CHARLES IS HE HERE OR ON THE PHONE LINE. BOTH A KEY WITNESSES ARE ON THE PHONE ALL RIGHT. SO MISTER MODERATOR IF% DR PADA CIARA IS AVAILABLE IF YOU TO HIM UP. AND IF NOT DOCTOR PRODUCTS ARE THEN- MR TELFORD. BUT I REMEMBER. I DO SHOW THAT- MISTER JOHNSON IS ON THE LINE YOUR LINE IS OPEN ALL RIGHT LET'S LET'S START WITH MR JOHNSON. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME HI MY NAME IS GREG CHAPLAIN I'M A LICENSED ATTORNEY. AND LEGAL COUNSEL WITH ALLIANCE DEFENDING FREEDOM. THE WORLD'S LARGEST NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION DEFENDING RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL. THE BILL PROTECTS THE RIGHT TO CALIFORNIANS TO WORSHIP AND TO EXERCISE THEIR FAITH ESPECIALLY IN DIFFICULT TIMES. AND IT DOES THIS WHILE STILL ALLOWING THE STATE TO REQUIRE COMPLIANCE WITH MUTUAL HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. THE COMMISSION APPROVED THE BILL FOR THREE REASONS FIRST WHICH IT IS IMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIANS AND WORSHIP SERVICES ARE INTEGRAL PART OF THE EXERCISE OF RELIGION. SECOND POTENTIALLY DURING CRISES WE TO PROTECT THE FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION BECAUSE APART FROM BEING A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT. RELIGION IS ALSO A VITAL SOURCE OF SUPPORT TO PEOPLE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. THIRD CALIFORNIANS NEED THIS BILL MAY NEED IT NOW. FOR MOST OF THE PAST YEAR COUNTY CHURCHES AND PEOPLE OF FATE SUFFERED VIOLATIONS THAT THEIR RIGHT TO EXERCISE RELIGION. THERE WERE MORE COURT CASES ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF FREE EXERCISE RIGHT TO CALIFORNIA THAN ANY OTHER STATE. AND THIS IS BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S RESTRICTIONS DISCRIMINATED AGAINST RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS THREE OF THEM WERE SPECTACULAR CONTENT THAT POSED COME TERRIBLE WRITTEN. A CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS NOTED THE STATE DETERMINATION THAT THE MAXIMUM NUMBER BUT HEARING THAT COULD SAFELY WORSHIP WHEN THE MOST CAVERNOUS CATHEDRAL ZERO. REFLECTED AN INSUFFICIENT APPRECIATION OF THE CONSIDERATION OF THE INTERESTS AT STAKE. SO WHEN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH RESTRICTS CHURCHES ON THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IS GOING TO STOP IT BUT UP TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH TO REMEDY THE PROBLEM BY NOTHING CONCRETE PROTECTIONS. THIS BILL RICHARD THE STATE WILL RESPECT THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT THE TAKEN THREE CHURCHES AT LEAST AS WELL AS SECULAR BUSINESSES THE PAYLOAD OPEN. ADJUSTING CAN CONFIRM HER DEFENSE THE COURT'S LATEST DECISION. SENATOR JONES JUST SAID THE FIRST AMENDMENT REQUIRED THAT IT BE ST LOUIS CONDUCT AS WELL AS THE PATRIOTS COMPATIBLE SECULAR CONDUCT. SO EVEN IF YOU DO NOT ASCRIBE TO RELIGION OR IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT COMMUNITY WORSHIP SERVICES ARE NECESSARY. MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS DO YOU BELIEVE THAT. AND ASIDE FROM THAT VERY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION THE CONSTITUTION ITSELF ATTACKED THE FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION AS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT. IN THIS BILL PROTECT THAT DELIBERATE I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I. URGE THE COMMITTEE TO APPROVE THE BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHILDHOOD- MODERATE DR- BUT A CHAU. ON THE ON THE LAW. I DO SHOW THE ON LINE YOUR LINE OPEN. HI THIS IS JAY ABOUT IT. DR GO AHEAD WHAT WE CAN HEARING THAT YES WE CAN GO AHEAD AT. OKAY SO GOOD BECAUSE I CAN GIVE MY TESTIMONY DONE. SO I I'M- I'M DOCTOR GAVE A SHARIA I'M A PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AT HERE STANFORD UNIVERSITY- I'M TALKING IN FAVOR OF THE RELIGION AND SHELLAC- I'VE BEEN DOING IT ALL COVERED RESEARCH INCLUDING MULTIPLE PUBLISHED PAPERS ON COLD AT THIS ARE PROBABLY BECAUSE OF IT THE FACT LOCKDOWN. AND ALSO A CO AUTHOR OF THE PAPER INTO DECORATIONS FROM A LOT OF BACKGROUND IN IN A PUBLIC POLICY AT THAT BEEN TESTIFYING AS AN EXPERT WITNESS ON MULTIPLE CASES INVOLVING CHURCHES INCLUDING AT THE TWO THAT HAVE GONE TO THE SUPREME COURT BUT THAT THAT- WOULD HAVE COME DOWN IN FAVOR. OF CHURCH OFCHURCH OPENING- SO. AM STRONG IN OF THIS. FOR A- LITTLE. AND FOR. THREE MADE THREE. FIRST IF YOU LOOK AT THE SCENE. AND WORLD HEALTH. GUIDANCE ON RELIGIOUS OR- DURING AND- BOTH OF THEM AMPLIFY. THE OF- PRIVILEGES. AND PERMITTING RELIGIOUS WORSHIP DURING CONDUCT- THAN SAY THAT- THAT TRADITIONALLY CLOSED- YOU OR TOWARD. MARSHALL BECAUSE DOOR OR A SHINING ACTUALLY BOTH. THAT AT THE GATE AND THE SOCK REPORT. FREE RELIGIOUS WORSHIP- SECOND- AND THIS IS THE MOST POINT. IF CHURCHES WOULD TO SAY. AND PUBLIC HEALTH COULD MORE WHICH- TO HAVE SAFE WORSHIP- AND IT'S NOW THAT THE IN MANY CHURCHES PUBLIC HEALTH- JUST CLOSE THE PUBLIC A LOCAL PUBLIC BASICALLY JUST CLOSES THE CHARGING DOWN. BOB AND DOESN'T ALLOW WORSHIP INSTANCE CREATED A SITUATION WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF CONFLICT WHEN THERE DOESN'T. NEED TO BE IN FACT A PUBLIC IT IF. SURE TEAM ARE STILL PUBLIC HEALTH COULD WORK THE CHURCH'S FOR STATE PORTION TO. LIKE PUBLIC REPORTS WERE OTHER. BUSINESS TALKED OPERATE SAFELY DURING AND AFTER. FINALLY MOST IMPORTANTLY CHURCH ATTENDANCE IS A KEY PART OF THAT WHILE LIVE LIFE FOR MANY MANY PEOPLE ON THE STREET FOR SYNAGOGUES AND MOSQUES AS WELL. OBVIOUSLY IT'S PROTECTED THE PERSON FOR A REASON- THEY THEY ARE ESSENTIAL AND SHOULD BE DEEMED ESSENTIAL- AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT THE TOLL COULD DO THAT. OUR EFFECT VIOLATING LEGISLATING WHAT ACTUALLY- PROTECTING PEOPLE FROM THE PANDEMIC IT IN WAYS THAT THEY COULDN'T. BE MEDICATED WITH STOP WITH. BUT STILL SORT OF- BUT NOW THE UP BACK IN THE TITLE OF THE SOCCER THANK YOU YOUR PATIENCE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. ALL RIGHT.

ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MR MODERATOR WE'RE GOING TO BRING IT BACK HERE THE CHAMBER I SEE THAT CENTER BOARD JUST SAYS IS MIKE UP. SO THE BARGES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. COLLEAGUES. IN MY OPINION THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE KIND OF TAKE A STEP BACK YOU CAN APPRECIATE THAT. THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE. I DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS A THEOLOGICAL ISSUE EITHER IN NOR IS IT LIMITED ENTIRELY TO- COVERT RELATED POLICY. IN MY OPINION THIS IS A CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO WRAP OUR ARMS AROUND. IN A SEMI POSTCODE- THE SITUATION AS WE GRAPPLE WITH WITH HOW WE CONDUCT OURSELVES DURING THE PANDEMIC. THE FIRST AMENDMENT AS WE'VE WE ALL KNOW. CONGRESS SHALL MAKE NO LAW PROHIBITING. THE EXERCISE OF RELIGION OR PEACEFUL ASSEMBLY. AND NO STATE SHALL MAKE OR ENFORCE ANY LAW. THAT DENIES THE EQUAL PROTECTION OF THE LAW. I SUBMIT TO YOU COLLEAGUES THAT I BELIEVE THIS IS A FIRST AMENDMENT CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE. THAT INVOKES EQUAL PROTECTION PROTECTIONS. LET'S GO BACK TO WIN THE PANDEMIC BEGAN. WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE VIRUS HE TOOK TIME FOR US TO UNDERSTAND ITS PATHOLOGY. WE BEGIN TO APPRECIATE THAT- IT WAS TRANSMITTED BY CLOSE PERSONAL CONTACT AND THAT OF COURSE GAVE RISE TO THE HEALTH PROTOCOLS OF THE MASK MANDATE. THE DISTANCING AND- THE HAND WASHING AND- THE DISALLOWANCE OF ATTENDING CERTAIN ACTIVITIES. BUT OVER TIME WE BEGIN UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN HEALTH PROTOCOLS. THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR A REASONABLY SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR THOSE THAT WANTED TO PARTICIPATE. IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES. NOW I'M A CHURCH GOER MY FATHER'S A CHURCH GOER MY NINETY ONE YEAR OLD FATHERS A CHURCH GOER. AND HE I DON'T THINK EVER REALLY MISSED A DAY OF CHURCH OR SUNDAY IN HIS LIFE. BUT WHEN THIS PANDEMIC HAPPENED GIVEN HIS- MEDICAL CONDITIONS IN UNDERLYING SITUATIONS. I DIDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE TAKING A TRIP TAKEN TO CHURCH AND I MYSELF DIDN'T GO TO CHURCH. FOR A EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME AND I'M AN AVID TO CONGREGATE AT SAINT GEORGE GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH IN FRESNO CALIFORNIA. BUT I BELIEVE IN SCIENCE AND I BELIEVE IN DOUBT AND I BELIEVE ON LEARNING FROM EXPERTS. I WAS A PROFESSOR FOR OVER A DECADE NINE I HOLD THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE SUFFICIENTLY SCHOOLED AND EDUCATED IN RESPECTIVE DISCIPLINES THAT THEY TELL ME. THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN ACTIVITIES YOU SHOULD AVOID OR AT LEAST UNDERTAKE TO MITIGATE THE RISKS THAT ALL LISTEN TO THEM. SO I DID NOT GO TO CHURCH FOR A WHILE. AND I BELIEVE THAT WAS THE RIGHT COURSE OF ACTION. BUT THEN SOMETHING CHANGED WE BECAME BETTER AWARE OF WHAT THE PATHOLOGY OF THE VIRUS ONCE. IN HOW WE COULD STILL PARTICIPATE ON A LIMITED BASIS. WHETHER IT BE GOING TO THE GROCERY STORE TO HOME DEPOT OR- INTERACTING WITH OTHER FOLKS. SO WHEN CERTAIN RULES WERE PUT FORWARD THAT DISALLOWED. CONGREGANTS FROM ASSEMBLING ON CHURCH GROUNDS. I WOULD ASK MYSELF WHAT IS MY CHURCH DOING TO PROTECT THESE INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE CAT COUNTY LAW AND STATE LAW WE'RE DISALLOWING CERTAIN ACTIVITIES. BUT I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THERE WAS SUFFICIENT SOCIAL DISTANCING THAT IT WAS OUTSIDE. AND ALL THE RELEVANT PROTECTIONS AND PROTOCOLS ARE PUT INTO PLACE. YET INDIVIDUALS AND MOSQUES TEMPLES AND CHURCHES WERE NOT ALLOWED FOR- TO BE OPEN FOR BUSINESS. THAT'S WHY BRING UP THIS ISSUE OF. THE CONSTITUTIONALITY. OF WHAT OCCURRED AND WHY THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE INSIDE A RELIGIOUS ISSUE. IF WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE A RIGHT TO ASSEMBLE. THEN WE NEED TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE FIGHT FOR THAT RIGHT ON THE SOLE CONDITION. THAT WE ARE ABIDING BY THE PREVAILING HEALTH PROTOCOLS. SO AS A MATTER OF EQUAL PROTECTION THE QUESTION THAT WE MUST ASK OURSELVES. WERE THESE CHURCHES FOR THESE MOSQUES OR THE SYNAGOGUES. PRACTICING THE PREVAILING HEALTH DIRECTIVES OF THE STATE THE CDC OR THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES IF THE ANSWER WAS YES. BUT I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE A RIGHT TO ATTEND. UNDER THOSE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES. SO I THINK THIS BILL TALKS ABOUT. WHETHER GOING TO CHURCH OR MOSQUE OR TEMPLE IS AN ESSENTIAL ACTIVITY. I ASK MYSELF IF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. ARE CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL IN AMERICA THAN BEING ABLE TO ATTEND THESE ACTIVITIES ON THE SOLE CONDITION BUT THEY ARE ABIDING BY THE PREVAILING HEALTH DIRECTIVES. THAT THAT IS A CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED ESSENTIAL ACTIVITIES. I'M NOT SURE HOW YOU CAN GET AROUND THAT I WANNA BE VERY CLEAR MY COLLEAGUES. I DID NOT SEND MY FATHER TO CHURCH BECAUSE I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE VIRUS. I DID NOT SEND MY FATHER CHURCH FOR MY FAMILY IF THERE WERE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THERE WAS NO SOCIAL DISTANCING THERE'S NO MASK WEARING AND THERE'S IT WASN'T OUTDOORS BUT ON THE CONDITION THAT IT WAS. IT WAS CONSISTENT. WITH THOSE PREVAILING AUTHORITY DIRECTORS I COULD NOT SEE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GOING TO HOME DEPOT. AND GOING TO CHURCH. AND THAT I THINK IS WHAT THIS ISSUE IS ABOUT TODAY. IS THAT IF WE BELIEVE THAT CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF RELIGION AND ASSEMBLY IN THE EQUAL APPLICATION. OF THE LAW. WE MUST FIND OURSELVES IN THE LEGAL DIRECTION THAT IT THAT THAT GOING TO CHURCH OR MOSQUE OR TEMPLE. IS A CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED ACTIVITY. THAT'S WHY COLLEAGUES AT ASK YOU. MAKE CERTAIN YOU DON'T GET SEDUCED BY THE PARTISAN NATURE OF HOW THIS ISSUE HAS ARISEN IN THE MEDIA. THIS IS A CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION NOT A THEOLOGICAL QUESTION. THANK YOU SIR BURGESS- CENTER HERTZBERG IS YOUR MICHAEL. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. I COMPLETELY AGREE. WITH MY COLLEAGUE. THAT THIS IS ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PARTISANSHIP IT HAS TO DO WITH THE SAKE RIGHTS. ENUMERATED THE FIRST AMENDMENT OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. CONGRESS SHALL MAKE NO LAW WHETHER IT'S FREE SPEECH FREE PRESS ASSEMBLY OR RELIGION NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY HOW THE CONSTITUTION'S BEEN INTERPRETED. SIMPLE EXAMPLES JUSTICE HOME SAID YOU CAN'T YELL FIRE IN A CROWDED THEATER WE HAVE RIGHT FREE SPEECH. DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO SAY FREE SPEECH HE'LL FIRED A CREDITOR NO BECAUSE IT CREATES A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER. TO TEST WHETHER IT'S RELIGION OR ASSEMBLY. OR OUR- SPEECH. IS BALANCED BY AND POLICE POWER AS WE TRY TO CREATE A WORKABLE GOVERNMENT. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE RIGHTS ARE HELD IN THE HIGHEST. SACRED NATURE OF WHICH THEY ARE INFORMED AND OUR CONSTITUTION BUT THERE IS ALSO A BALANCE. SO NOW YOU HAVE AN EXECUTIVE FACED WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY EMERGENCY. THE QUESTION IS OF COURSE UNDER CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES THEY HAVE TO EXERCISE STRICT SCRUTINY IN THAT REGARD. NO QUESTION BUT A STRICT READING OF WHAT WAS ARTICULATED HERE AND WHAT'S ARTICULATED THIS BILL IS THAT WERE BASICALLY TURNING OVER THE POLICE POWERS DETERMINATION OF WHAT SHOULD AND SHOULDN'T DO TO THE COURTS WERE ELIMINATING EXECUTIVES IRRESPECTIVE OF WHAT THEIR POWER IS TO MAKE THOSE DETERMINATIONS OF ALL OF US SAID THERE'S AN OUTBREAK OF LEPROSY. IF THERE'S A SHOOTER THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT IT HAPPENS TO HAVE A CHURCH AND WE WANT TO IMPOSE A CURFEW BECAUSE WE WANT TO PROTECT. PEOPLE FROM GETTING SHOT AND THEY SAY WELL I WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A RELIGIOUS OR I WANT TO BE ABLE TO ASSEMBLE IN WHATEVER MY ORGANIZATIONS COULD BE THE QANTAS CLUB I'M SORRY THE GOVERNMENT HAS A POLICE POWER. TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND IF YOU IF YOU ANALYZE THE CASES I HAVE READ IN. ATTENDED VERSES NEWSOME IT CAME DOWN APRIL NINTH I THINK THAT THE GUIDANCE BASICALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS IT SEEMS TO ME IN READING THIS CASE. IS THAT IT'S REALLY A FACT BASED CASE THAT THE EXECUTIVE RDER SHOULD HAVE MORE CLEARLY ARTICULATE GIVEN THE FACT THAT THIS RELATES TO FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF ASSEMBLY OR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF RELIGION. IT SHOULD HAVE MORE CLEARLY ARTICULATED THIS BUT IN ESSENCE WHAT JUSTICE. KAGAN SAYS JOIN WITH. R. J. BRYER JUST TO SORT OF MY ORDER. SHE TALKS ABOUT YOU KNOW WHETHER THERE'S A RISK OR NOT. IN IN LOOKING AT THE COURT AND THEY MAKE THREE POINTS FIRST WHEN PEOPLE GATHER IN SOCIAL SETTINGS THE INTERACTIONS ARE LIKELY TO BE LONGER. THAN THEY WOULD BE IN A COMMERCIAL SETTING AND LOOKING AT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN TAPPING THE COMMERCIAL CONTEXT. PERSON ASSEMBLY WHETHER IT'S RELIGIOUS OTHERWISE SECONDLY. RIVA HOUSE ARE TYPICALLY SMALLER AND LESS VENTILATED. THAN COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHMENT THIRD SOCIAL DISTRICTS AGAIN MASS WEARING ARE LESS LIKELY IN PRIVATE SETTINGS IN ENFORCEMENT IS MORE DIFFICULT. IN OTHER NECESSARY STEPS TO DO THE DIAGNOSTIC IN THAT REGARD. BUT THE PRINCIPLES REMAIN THE SAME. IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO RUN A GOVERNMENT. IF YOU STIFF IF YOU'RE TERM PROTECTION OF THE CONSTITUTION. AS SET FORTH IN THIS MEASURE WAS SO STRICT. THAT IT LITERALLY NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED YOU'D BE TO FEARFUL. THAT YOU COULD NOT ENGAGE THE POLICE POWER TO DEAL WITH. WHATEVER THE ISSUE WAS BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO WORRIED THAT THE STRICT INTERPRETATION OF THE LAWS WRITTEN WOULD ELIMINATE YOUR ABILITY DO SO. SO YES THESE ARE SACRED RIGHTS BUT THEIR BALANCE FOR ALL OF US IN SOCIETY BECAUSE WE LIVE TOGETHER WE WORK TOGETHER WE LIVE IN TH SAME COMMUNITIES. TO BE ABLE TO WORK TO MAKE IT. UNDERSTANDABLE IN A WORKABLE WAY THIS IS A GLOBAL PANDEMIC THAT AFFECTED ALL ELEMENTS. OF THE YOU THAT YOU SEE THAT STATES BUT THE GLOBE. AND SO THAT REGARD. I THINK THAT- THAT THIS MEASURE YES- PROPERLY CHARACTERIZED BY MY COLLEAGUES AND FRESNO. IT I TAKE A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION. AND WOULD NOT SUPPORT THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS HERE. THANK YOU SENATOR. HOT SEEING NO OTHER MY- THAT ARE ALL. SENATOR BOARD JUST MOVES THE BILL. SENATOR JOHN SECURE CLOSE. MISTER MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DO WANT TO THANK BOTH THE- THE SENATOR IN SUPPORT IN THE SENATE OPPOSITION FOR THEIR WELL THOUGHT OUT AND- RESPECTFUL COMMENTS. MISTER CHAIR I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT- I THINK YOU'VE VERY FAIRLY. CONDUCTED THE HEARING AND I APPRECIATE YOUR DILIGENCE IN- LISTENING TO THE SUPPORTERS. OF THE BILL- I'M GONNA THINK ALSO THE ALL THE PEOPLE THAT TESTIFIED TODAY THAT HAVE WAITED A LONG TIME TO BE ABLE TO SHARE THEIR VOICES ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. WE RECEIVE SUPPORT FROM OVER SEVEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS- SO THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO HEAR FROM JUST A SELECT PORTION OF THEM TODAY AND THAT SEVEN THOUSAND. IS ACROSS THE STATE- WHEN WE INTRODUCED THIS BILL. I WAS OVERWHELMED WITH MEDIA REQUESTS AND- COMMENTS FROM ALL OVER THE STATE. AND WHAT ARE OUR INTENTION IS TO COMMUNICATE IF YOU'RE CONSTITUENTS REACH OUT TO OUR OFFICE AT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THAT COMMUNICATION FROM YOUR OWN CONSTITUENTS. I HAVE A COUPLE FINAL THOUGHTS BEFORE WE VOTE NOW FIRST AS WE KNOW THE U. S. SUPREME COURT HAD TO INTERVENE TWICE. IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS WHEN THE GOVERNOR'S. WHEN THE GOVERNOR SOUGHT TO COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN HOUSES OF WORSHIP THE SUPREME COURT RULED THAT WHILE THE GOVERNOR CAN IMPOSE. REASONABLE SAFETY RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITS. I GOVERNOR CANNOT ARBITRARILY PADLOCK CHURCHES SHRINES TEMPLES MOSQUES AND SYNAGOGUES. EVEN THE DISSENTERS IN THESE DECISIONS BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNOR CANNOT ARBITRARILY TREAT RELIGION DIFFERENTLY THAN SIMILAR SECULAR ACTIVITIES. AS JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR WAS QUOTED THE- EARLIER- QUARTER AGAIN. QUOTE THEY MAY RESTRICTED TENDENCY TO HOUSES OF WORSHIP SO LONG AS COMPARED WILL SECULAR INSTITUTIONS FACE RESTRICTIONS THAT ARE AT LEAST EQUALLY AS STRICT. END QUOTE. THIS SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR IT AFTER THE RULING IN FEBRUARY THE COURT HAD TO STEP IN AGAIN ON FRIDAY NIGHT AND RAIN IN OUR GOVERNOR THIS TIME FOR IN HOME PRIVATE RELIGIOUS GATHERINGS MY POINT IS THAT WHILE I BELIEVE THE COURT GOT THESE RULINGS RIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT A FUTURE GOVERNOR DURING A FUTURE EMERGENCY DOESN'T I TRY THIS AGAIN. WE NEED TO GUARANTEE THE RIGHT TO PRACTICE ONE'S RELIGION. IN STATE LAW. SENATE BILL THREE NINETY SEVEN WILL DO THIS SIMPLY. DECLARING THAT RELIGION IS ESSENTIAL AND SHOULD BE ON EQUAL FOOTING. WITH ALL OTHER SERVICES AND INDUSTRIES. DESIGNATED AS ESSENTIAL DURING AN EMERGENCY. SECOND WE HAVE SEEN THE FRIGHTENING STATISTICS ABOUT THE AFFECT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS IN ISOLATION ARE HAVING ON OUR FAMILIES OUR FRIENDS AND OUR CONSTITUENTS. FEELINGS OF DEPRESSION ARE REPORTED TO BE UP AS HIGH AS FORTY TWO PERCENT. ANXIETY IS UP FOURTEEN PERCENT. DRUG OVERDOSES ARE UP DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AS FAR AS WE KNOW IS UP NINE PERCENT. NUMBER SIX V. BEGINNING TO SEE MORE AND MORE REPORTS IN THE AND THE NEWS MEDIA A TEEN AND YOUTH SUICIDE- AND ATTEMPTS. I COULD GO ON AND ON. BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT ORDERED SHUTDOWNS HAVE EXASPERATED THESE NUMBERS. ARE ALL OF THESE INCREASES DUE SOLELY TO THE CLOSURE OF HOUSES OF WORSHIP OF COURSE NOT. IT HAS CERTAINLY BEEN A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR FOR MANY. ALL THIS BILL ASKS IS FOR THE PEOPLE OF EVERY COLOR. READ GENDER AGE REGION LIFESTYLE AND POLITICAL PERSUASION. ABLE TO ENGAGE IN THEIR FREEDOM TO PRACTICE THEIR RELIGION WITH THEIR FELLOW PRACTITIONERS. WE HAVE A RIGHT TO SAFELY SHOP IN A CROWDED BIG BOX STORE SURELY WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAFELY ATTEND RELIGIOUS SERVICES. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS STRAIGHT FORWARD AND CRITICALLY IMPORTANT MAJOR THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR JONES FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL- BENNETT CHIEF COUNSEL IF YOU'D CALL THE ROLL SENATE BILL THREE NINETY SEVEN BY SENATOR JONES WITH A MOTION BY SENATOR BOARD YES THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE RE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION- BURKE NO. AMBERG NO PORGES. FORGES I CARRY IT ON NOT PUTTING. IT ON NOT VOTING DID ASAL. GONZALEZ. NO GONZALEZ NO HERTZBERG HERTZBERG NO JONES HI JONES I LAYERED NO BLARED NO STERN. WHITE HOUSE SKI NO WAY CASKEY NO WIENER. HE PUT THE BILL ON CALL TO FIVE SO FAR ON CALL OKAY. BILLS ON CALL. WE NEXT MOVED TO CENTER LEVELS BILL SB THREE THREE ONE. SENATE LABOR THE FLOOR'S YOURS. STRUCTURE GOOD AFTERNOON I WANT TO FIRST THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL MUCH APPRECIATED SENATE BILL THREE THREE ONE ALSO KNOWN AS THE SILENCE NO MORE ACT EXPANDS THE PROHIBITION ON NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS ALSO KNOWN AS NDAS IN SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS INVOLVING SEXUAL HARASSMENT SEXUAL ASSAULT SEXUAL DISCRIMINATION TO COVER SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS INVOLVING. ALL FORMS OF HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION THIS BILL ALSO EXPANDS THE PROHIBITION ON OVERLY BROAD CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON DISPARAGEMENT CLAUSES IN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS TO COVER WORKERS WHO ARE REQUIRED TO SIGN THESE TYPES OF CLAUSES AS PART OF A SEVERANCE PACKAGE. AS YOU MAY REMEMBER I AUTHORED AND THEN GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED INTO LAW SB EIGHT TWENTY ALSO KNOWN AS A STAND ACT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SB EIGHT TWENTY SPECIFICALLY BANNED NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS TO CASES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEX DISCRIMINATION. IMPORTANTLY THE ACT ALSO PERMITS THE CLAIMANTS REQUEST CONFIDENTIALITY IF THEY SO CHOOSE. NOTHING THIS HISTORIC LAW THE LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZE THAT SECRET SETTLEMENTS OR HELPING TO PERPETRATE HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENTS BY ALLOWING COMPLAIN TENDS TO BE SWEPT UNDER THE RUG. OF COURSE SECRET SETTLEMENTS PLAY AS MUCH OF A ROLE IN PERPETUATING WORK DISCRIMINATION HARASSMENT AND BIAS BASED ON RACE ETHNICITY SEXUAL ORIENTATION AGE DISABILITY AND RELIGION. BECAUSE HERE TO COMPLAIN TENS OR CAPS THE COMPLAINTS ARE KEPT SECRET AND THOSE WHO RAISE THE COMPLAINTS ARE EFFECTIVELY SILENCED. MEMBERS IT IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR ANY EMPLOYER TO TRY TO SILENCE A WORKER BECAUSE HE OR SHE WAS A VICTIM OF ANY TYPE OF HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION DISCRIMINATION. SB THREE THREE ONE WILL EMPOWER SURVIVORS TO SPEAK OUT IF THEY SO WISH SO THE PERPETRATORS CAN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND WE CAN HOPEFULLY PREVENT ABUSERS FROM CONTINUING TO TORMENT AND ABUSE OTHER WORKERS. LASTLY I'M ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AS NOTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THAT WILL MAKE CLEAR THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT PREVENT AN EMPLOYER FROM INCLUDING A RELEASE OF CLAIMS AND A SEVERANCE AGREEMENT. IT DOES NOT PREVENT AN EMPLOYER FROM PROHIBITING THE DISCLOSURE OF ANY AMOUNT OF PAID. ANY AMOUNT PAID ANY SETTLEMENT OR SEVERANCE AGREEMENT AND IT OF COURSE DOES NOT PREVENT AN EMPLOYER FROM PROHIBITING THE DISCLOSURE OF TRADE SECRETS PROPRIETARY INFORMATION OR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION THAT DOES NOT INVOLVE UNLAWFUL ACTS IN THE WORKPLACE. HERE WITH ME REMOTELY TO TESTIFY TO SHARE HER OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AS THE FORMER OSAMA. N. AS WELL PETER BROOK IN THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION THANK YOU MR THANK YOU SIR LEYVA- MISS OZTUMER THE FIRST. TWO MINUTES FOR EACH OF YOU. MISS OSAMA IF YOU ARE. THE CLOSURE GET. SHARE AMERICAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY TODAY MY ENTIRE CAREER HAS BEEN AS A TAX PUBLIC POLICY OFFICIALS USUALLY ENGAGING WITH OFFICES LIKE YOURS ON BEHALF OF LARGE COMPANIES LIKE GOOGLE FACEBOOK AND PENTRE. BACK MY LAST WORK TRIP BEFORE THE PANDEMIC SHUT DOWN PROBLEM ALL WHAT COULD BE SEATED FOR THAT WORK AYE LAD ON HEALTH MISINFORMATION. THAT WAS JUST DAYS BEFORE PINTEREST LAWYERS PRESENTED ME WITH A HIGHLY RESPECTED THE NDA THAT WAS MEANT TO KEEP ME SILENT ABOUT THE RACE AND GENDER DISCRIMINATION AND RETALIATION CLAIMS THAT I AGREED QUIETLY OVER THE PREVIOUS YEAR. WHEN I EVENTUALLY DECIDED TO COME FORWARD PUBLICLY I ALONG WITH THE COURAGEOUS FORMER COLLEAGUE NAMED ERICA COMMUNITY BANK. DID SO WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WOULD BE COVERED FOR DISCLOSURES RELATED TO GENDER BASED DISCRIMINATION UNDER AT EIGHT TWENTY WHICH WERE SO GRATEFUL TO SENATOR LEYVA FOR OFFERING DURING THE ME TOO pBLACK WOMEN WE COULD NOT DISENTANGLE OUR RATE FOR MY GENDER WHICH MEANT THAT MENTION OF THE RACE DISCRIMINATION WE IN DEREK COULD RESULT IN LEGAL RETALIATION. NO OTHER WORKERS SHOULD BE IN A POSITION WHERE PART OF THEIR IDENTITY ISN'T COVERED WHEN IT COMES TO DISCLOSING EXPERIENCES. OF DISCRIMINATION. AND HE IS LIKE THE I NO CLUE BUT TO SIGN OUR USED BY. ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WORKERS UP ON TO MENTALLY AMERICANS EACH RIGHT. IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC HOW MANY WORKERS CAN REFUSE TO SIGN ONE OF THESE AGREEMENTS. AT THE EXPENSE OF THE INCOME OUR HEALTH INSURANCE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. WHAT'S WORSE IS THAT COMPANIES DON'T EVEN NEED TO AND BE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION SAY. THAT INFO IS ALREADY PROTECTED TO THE EAST OF CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS EMPLOYEES MIGHT FIND WHEN THEY'RE HIRED. FINALLY THIS BILL MY DAUGHTER GREEN. COULD ALSO BENEFIT THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY BY INCREASING TRANSPARENCY FOR SHAREHOLDERS. UNLESS INDIVIDUALS SPEAK UP SHAREHOLDERS ARE OFTEN KEPT IN THE DARK ABOUT MISCONDUCT AT THE COMPANIES IN WHICH THEY HAVE A FINANCIAL STAKE. SB THREE THIRTY ONE AM DISCRIMINATION HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT BUT MY. HOPE IS THAT IT WILL AND THE- THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS OSAMA MISTER RICH IF YOU'RE ON THE LINE. YES GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS- I'M AN EMPLOYMENT ATTORNEY IN OAKLAND. OVER THE COURSE OF MY CAREER I REPRESENTED EMPLOYERS PUBLIC ENTITIES AN EMPLOYEE. IN A VARIETY OF EMPLOYMENT DISPUTES REVIEWING AND NEGOTIATING SETTLEMENT AND SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS AS A AS A LARGE PART OF MY PRACTICE- I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIAN PLANET LAWYERS ASSOCIATION. AND IT MISSES SOME OF THE TOURNEY- TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF SB THREE THREE ONE WILD NON DISPARAGEMENT CLAUSES AND SEVEN SCREAMIN. HAPPY COME MORE COMMON OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES THEY HAVE LITTLE SOCIAL VALUE AND WHY SHOULD. CALIFORNIANS LOOK FOR A SAFE PLACE TO WORK UNABLE TO GATHER INFORMATION ON GLASS DOOR FOR EXAMPLE. BECAUSE FRMER EMPLOYEES ARE TERRIFIED OF PUBLICLY THING TRUTHFUL THINGS ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES OF HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION. IN FACT RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THE AVAILABILITY OF NON ANONYMOUS INFORMATION GLASSDOOR ACTUALLY INCREASED AFTER SB EIGHT TWENTY. RESTRICTED THE USE OF SECRET SETTLEMENTS. AS I UNDERSTAND IT OPPONENT OF SB THREE THREE ONE ARGUE THAT THE BILL WILL DISCOURAGE EMPLOYERS FROM PAYING SEVERANCE TO WORKERS AND I HAVE TO NOTE THAT A SIMILAR ACCUSATION WAS MADE ABOUT SB EIGHT TWENTY THAT WITH THAT IF YOU TAKE AWAY THE NDA. PARTIES WON'T BE ABLE TO SETTLE CASES AND I CAN SAY THAT IN MY EXPERIENCE THAT IS NOT THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED. WHEN NDAS WERE TAKEN OFF THE TABLE THEY JUST NO LONGER BECAME A PART OF THE NEGOTIATION. WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT THE TRUE VALUE IN A SEVERANCE AGREEMENT AND RELEASE THE CLIENT NOT. HE CHRISSY PROVISION. A RELEASE AVOID THE POSSIBILITY OF MONTHS OR YEARS OF LITIGATION THE POTENTIAL AN ADVERSE JUDGMENT. FURTHER I I'D ARGUE THAT THE SECRECY PROVISIONS ARE EFFECTIVELY ENFORCEABLE- IN MY THIRTY YEARS OF LAW PRACTICE THE ONLY ENFORCEMENT ACTION I. CAN REMEMBER BEING AWARE OF WHAT'S DONALD TRUMP'S CLAIM AGAINST OUR BEGAN AGAIN. NO RATIONAL PLAYERS TO TWENTY FORCING NON DISPARAGEMENT CAUGHT DOING SO COMPLETELY PUBLICIZED. THE ALLEGED DISPARAGING COMMENTS BUT WE KNOW IS THAT THE TRUE VALUE IN THESE PROVISIONS AS THEIR INTERIM FACT AWAY TO INTIMIDATE EMPLOYEES THE THING STYLE AND EVEN ABOUT UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION OR HARASSMENT. IT'S NOT ONLY HURTS WORKERS ENDANGERS PUBLIC SAFETY AND THE PUBLIC GOOD AND DOES A DISSERVICE TO LAW ABIDING EMPLOYERS WHO ARE COMPETING FOR EMPLOYEES IN THE JOB MARKET WE URGE THE TWENTY TO VOTE YES ON SB THREE THREE ONE. THANK YOU MR AGAIN IF YOU WOULD STICK AROUND HERE- UNTIL WE TAKE OTHER SUPPORT OPPOSITION- I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT YEAH OF COURSE. C. NOLAN NELSON MCGARY- IN SUPPORT IF YOU'D TURN TO ROOM ONE TWELVE. NO ONE IN ONE ROOM ONE TWELVE ALL RIGHT LET'S GO TO THE PHONE LINE MISTER MODERATOR- IF THOSE LAWRENCE SUPPORT WOULD QUEUE UP. WILL TAKE YOUR NAME YOUR AFFILIATION IN YOUR POSITION. MISTER MODERATOR AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO QUEUE UP FOR SUPPORT IT IS ONE TWO ZERO AT THIS TIME. ONCE AGAIN IF YOU LIKE TO PLACE A LINE IN Q. FOUR SUPPORT IT IS ONE NINE ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND IF THERE ARE NO LINES IN Q. ALL RIGHT. LET'S NOT TURN THE OPPOSITION I UNDERSTAND THAT- MISS ASHLEY HOFFMAN. IT IS IN OPPOSITION IS THAT CORRECT CENTER LABEL. I BELIEVE THAT THE CHAMBER IS NO LONGER IN OPPOSITION BUT SHE HAVE A MAY HAVE A STATEMENT SHE WANTS TO MAKE A ALL RIGHT IF MISS HOFFMAN IS ON THE LINE. MISTER MODERATOR IF YOU WOULD OPEN FOR HER. THANK YOU THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THIS IS ACTUALLY HOPPIN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE- I WANT TO START BY THINKING FOUNDER LEYVA AND HER STAFF AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS- JUST BECAUSE LOOKING AT A COUPLE DAYS AGO WE ARE PRESENTLY REVIEWING THOSE AMENDMENTS WITH OUR MEMBERS. AND WILL ISSUE A LETTER NOTING ANY CHANGE IN OUR POSITION APPROPRIATE- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY I DO NOT YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. IF WE HAVE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION IT IS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. ALL RIGHT MISTER MAYOR ON THE LINE THANK YOU IF THERE'S ANYONE IN OPPOSITION IF YOU WOULD TO THEM UP PLEASE. AND AGAIN IF THERE IS ANYON WHO'D LIKE TO QUEUE UP A PROPOSITION IT IS ONE DIDN'T ZERO. AND THERE ARE NO LINES ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET ME TURN TO THE GALLERY I THINK I DID TURN THE GALLERY THERE'S NO IN THE GALLERY IN OPPOSITION AND JUST TO BE SURE ROOM ONE TWELVE THERE'S NO ONE IN ROOM ONE TWELVE IN OPPOSITION. WE'RE GOING TO BRING IT BACK HERE TO THE CHAMBER- LET ME GO TO MISTER BROKEN FOR JUST ONE MOMENT- MISTER REGAN IS STILL WITH US. OR OR CENTER LEVEL NINE AM TO TAKE THIS QUESTION. PROBABLY THE ATTORNEY WOULD BE BEST SUITED TO ASK THE QUESTION. ALL RIGHT SO- MR RUBIN. I REALIZE THERE'S A DANGER EXTRAPOLATING FROM LIMITED EXPERIENCE OF THE GENERAL CASE IN MY LIMITED EXPERIENCE THAT- THE- LEVERAGE POINT WITH RESPECT TO NON DISPARAGEMENT AND NON DISCLOSURE IT IS A SIGNIFICANT VALUE THAT THE VICTIM. MAY BE GIVING UP IN I UNDERSTAND- THIS BILL IS THAT IT IS STILL POSSIBLE TO NEGOTIATE A NON DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT AT SOME POINT IN TIME IS THAT CORRECT. THAT IS CORRECT IN IT I MEAN I THINK THOSE. THEY'RE GOVERNED BY ONE THOUSAND ONE YEAH RIGHT IT WOULD POINT IN THE PROCESS FROM POINT OF INCIDENT TO RESOLUTION CAN YOU ENTER INTO A NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT. WHILE IT ACTED SO WITH THIS THIS BILL FILLS A GAP THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE HAVE BUT THE LEGAL PARADIGM THAT SAYS YOU CAN'T HAVE. NDA AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT AND WE ALSO HAVE A PROCEDURE- THANKS THE SENATE AWAY THIS BILL A TWENTY THAT. THAT DRESSES- NONDISCLOSURE PROVISIONS IN THE COUNTRY THE SETTLEMENT BUT WHAT WAS MISSING HERE IS- A. A- A PROVISION THAT DEALT WITH NONDISCLOSURE. I AGREEMENTS NON DISPARAGEMENT CLAUSES THAT WERE BEING IMPOSED ON WORKERS KIND OF AT THE AT THE POINT OF SEPARATION OF EMPLOYMENT AND SO NOW AT THAT POINT UNDER UNDER THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION. BUT BACK KIND OF PREVENT PROVISIONAL BE UNLAWFUL UNLESS THERE WAS. AB A COMPLAINT ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINT A COURT COMPLAINT OR AN INTERNAL- COMPLAINT HAS BEEN FILED- IN WHICH CASE WE WOULD REVERT TO THE PROTECTION OF- OF. THE ONE THOUSAND ONE. OKAY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT I HAVE NEGLECTED TO GO TO THE PHONE LINES IN TERMS SUPPORT I WILL DO SO JUST SECOND BUT I JUST WANT TO FOCUS FOR SECOND ON ON NON DISCLOSURE IT BUT POINT BETWEEN AN INCIDENT. AND THE RESOLUTION CAN YOU. HAVE A PROVISION THAT PROVIDES FOR NON DISCLOSURE. WELL YOU CAN HAVE A PROVISION PROVIDING FOR. YEAH SO WHEN YOU THINK NONDISCLOSURE YOU MEAN A NON DISPARAGEMENT CLAUSES OR PROVISIONS THAT YOU CAN'T DISCLOSE ANYTHING ABOUT THE- SO THERE'S DEFINITELY IN THE WORKPLACE NINE. I DON'T WANT TO GET THE PUBLICLY BUT IS UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT. FILE ITEMS HERE ONE IS A NON DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT WITH THIS PROVISION AGREEMENT SAYS YOU CANNOT DISCLOSE THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT. AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER. CONCEPT AND THAT'S NON DISPARAGEMENT WHERE YOU CAN'T DISPARAGE THE OTHER PARTY. SO IN SEPARATING THE TWO- IT SOME POINT BETWEEN INCIDENT AND RESOLUTION YOU CAN NEGOTIATE A NONDISCLOSURE PROVISION AGREEMENT POLICE TO SARS I UNDERSTAND IS THAT RIGHT. THAT'S CORRECT OKAY YOU KNOW WHAT POINT BETWEEN INCIDENT AND RESOLUTION CAN YOU NEGOTIATE A PROVISION THAT PROVIDES FOR NON DISCLOSURE. WELL SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE WAS A COURT COMPLAINT FILED THERE WAS A MINISTER THE COMPLAINT FILED THE DEPARTMENT SHAREPOINT IN HOUSING- YOU COULD- YOU COULD GET THE IF YOU WERE. YOU KNOW IF YOU IF YOU FOLLOW THE PROCEDURES AND ONE THOUSAND ONE- YOU YOU CAN BE YOU CAN BE PREVENTED ONCE YOU FILE THE MINISTER COMPLAINED THE COR COMPLAINT YOU CAN BE PREVENTED I'M- FROM HAVING A- NONDISCLOSURE PROVISION IF. IF THERE IF THE RESOLUTION IS HAPPENING BEFORE THAT. YOU CAN'T RIGHT SO THAT NOBODY WAS MY QUESTION FORTY ONE THOUSAND ONE YEAH SO PRIOR TO FILING A COMPLAINT YOU CAN PROVIDE FOR NON DISCLOSURE BUT ONCE YOU FILE THE COMPLAINT IT IS ILLEGAL TO HAVE A RESOLUTION INCLUDES A NONDISCLOSURE PROVISION IS THAT. ACCURATE RIGHT OKAY. NOW LET'S TURN TO NON DISPARAGEMENT IT WHAT POINT IN THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THAT JUST DESCRIBED FROM INCIDENT THROUGH RESOLUTION CAN YOU NEGOTIATED NON DISPARAGEMENT AGREEMENT- PROVISION TO AGREEMENT. RIGHT SO THAT THE BILL UNDER THIS BY IT. YEAH UNDER UNDER THIS BILL- IF YOU HAVE A- A SEVERANCE AGREEMENT WHERE THERE'S NO THERE'S NO COURT ACTION FILE THERE'S NOTHING. PAKISTAN NOT TENDERED INTERNALLY TO THE COMPANY YOU CAN'T HAVE A NON DISPARAGEMENT CLAUSES IN. IN A SEPARATION AGREEMENT BOTH IN AGREEMENT WHERE THE EMPLOYEE KIND OF AS A ROUTINE MATTER OF SEPARATING IT HANDED A SEPARATION AGREEMENT AND FIND THAT. AND DOESN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO- CITY COUNCIL AND HADN'T FILED INTERNAL GRIEVANCE REGARDING B. B. UNLAWFUL CONDUCT IN THE WORKPLACE OR HAVE THEM CALL THE COURT COMPLAINT THAT THEY CAN'T BE BOUND BY A NON DISPARAGEMENT CLAUSES THE PEERS AND THE- AND YOU BRING THE- SO. FOR NON DISCLOSURE YOU CAN NEGOTIATE NONDISCLOSURE FTER A COMPLAINT IS FILED BUT NON DISPARAGEMENT YOU CANNOT AFTER A COMPLAINT IS FILED IS THAT RIGHT. WELL AFTER YOU KNOW AFTER A COMPLAINT AFTER SOME AND AFTER SOME ADMINISTRATIVE OR COURT COMPLAINT FILED ON NON DISCLOSURE SIDE. YOU CANNOT YOU CANNOT- HAVE A I NINE OKAY GALLAGHER SECTION SEMI COMPLICIT AYE AND I RIVERS YOUR CRITICAL RIGHT BUT I REVERSED IT. RIGHT YEAH OKAY. AND SO IN TERMS OF. THREADING THE NEEDLE HERE FOR A CLIENT THEN AGAIN I UNDERSTAND THE PUBLIC GOOD THAT IS ATTENDED TO THIS MEASURE BUT IN TERMS OF THREADING THE NEEDLE- IN ADVISING A CLIENT WITH RESPECT TO NON DISCLOSURE AND NON DISPARAGEMENT IS THAT BASICALLY THE STANDARD OF CARE SO THAT YOU HAVE TO ADVISE A CLIENT WHEN A CLIENT COMES IN AS TO WHAT THEIR RIGHTS AND REMEDIES ARE. EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER THEY FILED A COMPLAINT AND WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES ARE IN TERMS OF NEGOTIATING EITHER NON DISPARAGEMENT CLAUSE OR A OR A NON DISCLOSURE COSTS. YEAH I THINK I THINK IT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH A CLIENT ABOUT AND IT'S USUALLY NOT NECESSARILY THE PERSON YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN HE COMES IN THE DOOR BUT AT SOME POINT ONE RESOLUTION AS- IT CONTEMPLATED THEIR- DISCUSSION. THAT WE HAD. ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF FILING. A COURT OR ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINT- AND I MEAN THAT THAT THOSE ARE CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE HAPPENING NOW IN YOUR SB EIGHT TWENTY AND HAVE BEEN FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS- AND SO YOU KNOW YOU YOU HAVE THAT CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS ARE FILING AN ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD ACTION. ON SETTLEMENT BUT YOU KNOW I WOULD KIND OF JUST REVERT BACK TO MY EXPERIENCE- THE LAST FEW YEARS AND OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS NEGOTIATING SEVERANCE ENTITLEMENT AGREEMENT. AND THAT IS THAT IT'S REALLY AGAIN IN MY EXPERIENCE IT'S ABOUT THE RELEASE OF CLAIMS THAT THE VALUE THAT'S BEING PAID. BY THE EMPLOYER. IS FOR THE IS FOR THE RELEASE I'M NOT FOR EIGHTY EIGHT NINETY. FIVE I I'M PUTTING ASIDE KIND OF BUT YOU KNOW YOU WANT TELLING ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF SETTLEMENT ISSUE WHICH- YOU KNOW. IS A DIFFERENT ISSUE WHICH REALLY ISN'T AFFECTED BY ANY OF THE BILL THAT THAT SPOKE SPANISH BUT- IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW NONDISCLOSURE OF EVENTS IN THE WORKPLACE. I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF THE CONSIDERATION OF BEING PAID.

SENATE GONZALEZ MOVES THE BILL. MENTIONED CANCER CALL THE ROLL THIS IS THAT SENATE BILL THREE THIRTY WHEN BY SENATOR AT LEAVE ON MOTION BY SENATOR GONZALEZ- DATE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST AMEND AND THEN RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS- BURKE HI UMBERG AYE BURGESS.

NEXT I SEE SOME OF THE MALL WHO'S ONLINE- CERTAIN AMOUNT THIS BILL WAS ORIGINALLY ON CONSENT IS NO LONGER ON CONSENT THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU CHECK AND SENATORS. SB SIX THIRTY THREE GIVES NON ENGLISH SPEAKING CO SIGNERS IMPORTANT INFORMATION PROTECTS CONSUMERS FROM FRAUD WHILE ALSO PROVIDING MORE STABILITY TO BUSINESSES. THIS BILL REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY TO TRANSLATE. AND PLACE ON THEIR WEBSITES AND NOTICED A CO SIGNERS THIS NOTICE WILL BE TRANSLATED INTO BY THE FIVE MOST COMMONLY SPOKEN LANGUAGES IN CALIFORNIA AND BE PUT ON A SINGLE WEB PAGE. THE NOTICE MUST ONLY BE PROVIDED CO SIGNERS WHEN THE BUSINESS KNOWS OR HAS REASON TO KNOW THE COSIGNER DOES NOT SPEAK ENGLISH. THE DISCLOSURE PUTS THE COSIGNER ON THE NOTICE THAT THEY ARE LIABLE FOR THE CONTRACT AND DOES NOT REQUIRE THE BUSINESS TRANSLATE THE ENTIRE CONTRACT. THIS NOTICE WILL PROVIDE THE COSIGNER WITH THE ESSENTIAL INFORMATION BUT ALSO PROTECT THE BUSINESS BY GIVING THEM A TOOL FOR ENFORCEMENT TO COMBAT PLANES FROM CO SIGNERS OF THE CONTRACT IS. AN UNENFORCEABLE BECAUSE THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR OBLIGATIONS. TODAY ON THE LINE WE HAVE AYE DADDY CONDO KAISER FROM THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION AND DESIREE NEW IN ORDERS FROM THE JUSTICE AND DIVERSITY CENTER OF THE BAR ASSOCIATION OF SAN FRANCISCO TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. PLEASE THANK YOU CENTER THE MALL- OF MISCONDUCT GEYSER IF YOU'RE AVAILABLE. PLEASE PROCEED. I AM CAN YOU HEAR ME ALRIGHT WE CAN GO AHEAD. GREAT GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. OF THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION MY NAME IS DANIELLE KENDO KREIDER AND I REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION. A COALITION OF FOURTEEN LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDERS FROM AROUND THE STATE. WE THINK BOTH THE AUTHOR IN THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION FOR THE TIME THEY SPENT WORKING WITH CLICK ON THIS BILL. SB SIX THREE THREE AMEND CIVIL CODE SIXTEEN THIRTY TWO BY REQUIRING THAT A NOTICE BE PROVIDED TO A NON ENGLISH SPEAKING COSIGNER. AS THE SENATOR INDICATED IN THE NOTICE WILL BE POSTED ON BC AS AGENTS PUBLIC WEBSITE WHERE IT CAN EASILY BE ACCESSED BY BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE YOU CO SIGNERS. CURRENTLY MORE THAN SPEAK A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH. WELL EXISTING LAW REQUIRES A CONTRACT THAT'S NEGOTIATED IN SPANISH TAGALOG CHINESE VIETNAMESE OR KOREAN TO BE PROVIDED TO THE PERSON WHO WOULD BE TO GO SHE THAT THAT CONTRACT. THE SAME PROTECTION IS CANCELED OUT FOR CO SIGNERS WHEN THE BORROWER ACTS AS A TRANSLATOR FOR THE COSIGNER. GROCERS ARE FREQUENTLY NEEDED IN CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS A COMMON EXAMPLE INCLUDES COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO REQUIRE A PARENT TO CO SIGN ON HOUSING OR YOUNG ADULTS WHO NEEDS MOM OR DAD TO HELP THEM BUY THEIR FIRST CAR. AND IN THE EVENT THAT THE ORIGINAL PARTY TO THE CONTRACTORS THAT ARE NOT TRUTHFUL OR HAD NOT THE FILTER REQUIREMENTS IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE COSIGNER BE MADE AWARE AT THE TIME THE SIGNING OF THEIR FINANCIAL LIABILITY. THE PURPOSE OF SB SIX THREE THREE AND TO GIVE THE COSIGNER FAIR NOTICE THAT THEY ARE UNDERTAKING FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND THAT THEY SHOULD INVESTIGATE THE TERMS OF THEIR CONTRACT. SB SIX THREE THREE PROTECT NON ENGLISH SPEAKING CALIFORNIANS FROM FRAUD AND MISREPRESENTATION. AND IT PROTECTS BUSINESSES FROM ENTERING AGREEMENTS WITH PARTIES WHO CANNOT CONSENT TO THE TERMS. LESS GIVING BUSINESSES MORE CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT POWER. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IDENTITY. THANK YOU MISS KIND OF KAISER- MISS WHEN OR IF YOU'RE AVAILABLE. YES THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DESIREE WENT LARGE AND I AM THE SUPERVISING ATTORNEY AT THE CONSUMER ADVOCACY PROJECTS THAT THE JUSTICE NEVER SEE CENTER AT THE PARK THE TEACHING OF DIFFERENT DISCOUNTS.

TRANSACTION WHERE CONSIDERED NECESSARY BUSINESSES ARE BEST POSITIONED TO COMBAT FRAUD. THIS IS ESPECIALLY HELPFUL AS A TOOL TO PROTECT SMALL BUSINESSES. WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO CREATE THEIR OWN YOU KNOW IF. IT'S THE STATE LOCAL SUPPLY THE NOTICE AND TRANSLATION. SB SIX THREE THREE THE BIPARTISAN IT SHOULD BE TO CONTACT. THE SHARING MUTUAL FRIENDS. BECAUSE IT'S VERY LITTLE BURDEN FOR BUSINESSES. ENSURE THE BED ALL PARTY LINE CONTRACT ACTUALLY CENTER TURNED. IN A FOURTH NINETEEN YOU PERCENT OF A GREAT BENEFIT BUT SIMPLY UNDERSTANDING. THAT THEY WILL HAVE LEGAL AND FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. BECAUSE IT HAS NO IMPACT ON THE PRIMARY BORROWER.

SEND TO YOU LATE OPPOSITION- WE HAD UNDERSTOOD OUR CONCERNS WOULD BE ADDRESSED UNFORTUNATELY THEY WERE NOT- AS YOU KNOW THE CURRENT CONTRACT MUST BE PROVIDED IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE IF THE PERSON INVOLVED IN THE TRADE OR BUSINESS NEGOTIATION THAT LANGUAGE. SENATE BILL SIX THREE THREE CHANGES THAT STANARD IN REQUIRED AT THE SPECIFIC DISCLOSURE IF THE PERSON INVOLVED KNOWS OR HAS REASON TO KNOW THAT THE PERSON WHO WILL NOT RECEIVE THE GOODS IS NOT PROFICIENT IN ENGLISH- ASK FOR LEASE CONTRACT THAT IS OF COURSE THE GUARANTOR THE PENALTY FOR FAILING TO PROVIDE. A DISCLOSURE IN THE RENTAL CONTACT AS RETENTION OF THE LEAST FOR RENTAL HOUSING THE LANDLORD MAY NEVER SPEAK OR MEET THE GUARANTOR AND YET WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ELEVATED STANDARD OF CARE- THEREFORE THERE'S NO OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN STANDARD WOULD BE USED AGAINST THE LANDLORD THE LANDLORD FAILED TO PROVIDE THAT DISCLOSURE BASED MERELY ON THE ASSUMPTION ABOUT THE PROSPECTIVE TENANT. YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY IN THIS THE NATURE RENTAL HOUSING IS VERY LITIGIOUS OF CURRENT PANDEMIC WE'VE SEEN UNETHICAL PENDANT ATTORNEYS WHO'VE UTILIZED LEGALLY AMBIGUOUS CLAIMS AGAINST PROPERTY OWNERS TO STALL OBJECTIONS ORDER FOR THE LANDLORD TO PAY THE TENANT TO LEAVE. AND WHILE WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO OBJECTION TO PROVIDING THE DISCLOSURE WE HAVE RESPECTFULLY REQUESTED THAT THIS DISCLOSURE BE INCLUDED ONLY WHEN THE PERSON WHO ENGAGES IN A TRADE OR BUSINESS SPECIFICALLY THE RENTAL HOUSING PROVIDERS NEGOTIATE PRIMARILY IN ONE OF THESE LANGUAGES. HAVE BEEN THE CLEAR STANDARD FOR MANY YEARS AND WE ASK THAT IT REMAINS THAT WAY- IN THIS SITUATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HEARING OUR CONCERNS. THANK YOU MISS CARLSON- OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. ONE AGAIN IF YOU'RE IN OPPOSITE. PLEASE PRESS. ZERO WE DO HAVE ONE MORE IN THE QUEUE- WILL GO TO NUMBER FIVE SIXTY SIX THANK YOU HAD. HI CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES WE CAN GO AHEAD.

THANK YOU CHAIR AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT THE CLOSE SIGNER- THE AND- IN NO WAY THIEF THE PRIMARY SIGNER IS NEGOTIATING IN A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE OR IN AN LANGUAGE- EIGHT DOESN'T CHANGE THAT THIS IS ABOUT A CO SIGNER. IF THE LANDLORD DOES NOT HAVE. ANY EVIDENCE THAT THE COSIGNER DOES IS SPEAKS A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH THE THEY ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO OFFER ANY TYPE OF DISCLOSURE AND SO I THINK THAT THAT SHOULD JUST BE MADE CLEAR WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION- TO FURTHER CLARIFY. WILL YOU KNOW OF THIS PARTICULAR ASPECT BUT THIS BILL IS ABOUT CO SIGNERS AND NOT THE PRIMARY SIGNERS. THANK YOU SAN RAMON DOES THEIR MOTION SIR EARLIER MOVES THE BILL.

AFTER THAT WE HAVE S. B. TWO SEVENTY BY SENATOR ALSO AND THEN SB THREE TWENTY ONE BY SENATOR ALSO AND I THINK THAT COMPLETES OUR CALENDAR FOR THE DAY. I SEE SENATOR MAN WHO'S ENTERED THE CHAMBER. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY CENTER MEN WERE READY FOR YOU THANK YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH SHARON BURKE AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON SB SIX FIFTY FOUR- THIS IS A BILL. THAT CREATES NEW PROTECTIONS AND EXTENDS EXISTING SAFEGUARDS FOR CHILDREN N FAMILY COURT- PARTICULARLY THOSE ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE TESTIFYING IN RELATION TO CUT CITY AND- AND VISITATIONS SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL DOES TWO THINGS FIRST IT GENERALLY REQUIRES. THAT FOR CHILDREN ADDRESSING THE COURT SAID ABOUT CUSTODY OR VISITATION- THAT THE COURT. UP DO NOT OPEN FOR SENATE TESTIFY BEFORE THEIR PARENTS THE PARTIES UNLESS IT MAKES A DETERMINATION THAT THAT WOULD BE IN THE CHILD'S BEST INTEREST THAT CURRENTLY THE COURTS HAVE DISCRETION IT. TOO I'LL HELP ALLOW IN CAMERA TESTIMONY- BUT MANY OF THEM DECIDE NOT TO DO AND SO THEY HAVE TO FIND MAKE A FINDING IT THAT'S APPROPRIATE- AND I CAN BE VERY STRESSFUL AND TRAUMATIC FOR CHILDREN. HAVING TO TESTIFY IN FRONT OF THEIR PARENTS AS TO WHICH PARENT THEY WANT TO HAVE CUSTODY OBVIOUSLY THAT CAN BE A DIFFICULT THING IT CAN BE TRAUMATIZING- AND A NUMBER OF FOLKS BELIEVE THEY CAN CREATE LONG TERM EMOTIONAL DISTRESS AND HARM. OFTENTIMES FOR EXAMPLE CHILDREN WILL AGREE TO TESTIFY IN FRONT OF A JUDGE NOT KNOWING THAT THIS CAN ENTAIL STATING THEIR CUSTODY PREFERENCES IN FRONT OF THEIR PARENTS. HI THIS CAN SPLIT FOR FAMILIES AND I WAS JUST TALKING TO- SOMEBODY IN THIS BODY. ABOUT THIS AND THEY ARE EXPRESSING TO ME THAT THIS IS VERY TRAUMATIZING IT DOES SPLINTER FAMILIES- AND SO I THINK JEWELERS TESTIMONY CAN BE VERY IMPORTANT IN THESE TYPES OF SITUATIONS BUT- THEY SHOULD BE- OUR EMPHASIS SHOULD BE ON MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE IN SAFE ENVIRONMENTS- AND SO WHAT THE FIRST COMPONENT THIS BILL DOES. IS A SAID IS TO HAVE JUDGES- IT GENERALLY REQUIRES THE JUDGES- CREATING ALTERNATIVE TO TESTIFYING IN FRONT OF THEIR PARENTS- WHETHER THAT'S IN CAMERA TESTIMONY OR OR SOME OTHER OPTION. AND GENERALLY ONLY ALLOWS JUDGES TO FORCE CHILDREN TO TESTIFYING FROM THEIR PARENTS IN THESE MATTERS WHEN THEY DEEM THIS TO BE IMPORTANT NECESSARY. AND BENEFICIAL FOR THE CHILD'S EMOTIONAL HEALTH. THE SECOND THING THAT AS SIXTY FOUR IS THE IT TAKES EXIST SAFETY MEASURES. THAT ARE USED FOR CHILD CUSTODY DETERMINATIONS AND EXTENDS AND UNSUPERVISED VISITATIONS- CURRENTLY JUDGES MUST CONSIDER A HISTORY OF ABUSE. OR DRUG ADDICTION WHEN PLACING CHILDREN IN THE CUSTODY OF INDIVIDUALS- AND SO IF A JUDGE DOES DECIDE TO PLACE A CHILD IN THE CUSTODY OF INDIVIDUALS. WITH ANY OF THESE- TRIGGERS IN THEIR BACKGROUNDS THE JUDGE MUST CREATE A WRITTEN FINDING ON WHY THAT IS THE CASE- AND THAT ENSURES THAT RECORDS OF THESE TERMINATIONS ARE CAPPED. THIS CAN HELP SAVE LIVES IT HELPS- AS FAR AS DETERMINING CUSTODY- BUT UNFORTUNATELY RIGHT NOW THE SAME REQUIREMENT DOES NOT APPLY TO UNSUPERVISED VISITATIONS. EIGHT TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN STUDY BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE FOUND THAT 47% OF CONCEIVABLY LEADERS. CONTINUE TO RECOMMEND UNSUPERVISED VISITATIONS WITH PARENT. EVEN WHEN THE REPORTS OF VIOLENCE IN THAT HOME. HE'S ON SUPERVISORS. CAN LAST DAYS AND TOO OFTEN PUT CHILDREN IN DANGER. A TWELVE YEAR NATIONAL STUDY SHOWS THAT MANY CHILD HOMICIDE VICTIMS. ARE MURDERED TRAGICALLY BY DIVORCING OR SEPARATING PARENT DURING COURT ORDERED. AND SUPERVISED VISITATIONS WITH THAT PARENT DESPITE THE FACTS THE COURTS WERE OFTEN NOTIFIED OF A HISTORY OF ABUSE. AND EVIDENCE OF THREATS TO HARM THOSE CHILDREN. SB SIX FIFTY FOUR SIMPLY EXTENDS THE SAME OR SAFETY REQUIREMENTS CURRENTLY APPLY TO CHILD CUSTODY TO UNSUPERVISED VISITATION- THIS MINOR- BUT CRUCIAL CHANGE WILL SAVE THE LIVES OF CHILDREN- SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I VOTE AND I HAVE WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY- KIM ROBINSON A FAMILY LAW ATTORNEY. AND TRACY FELL OVER THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR YELLOW COUNTY CASF. THANK YOU CENTER MEN MISS ROBINSON ARE YOU ON THE PHONE. MYSTERONS ENDED MISS ROBINSON IS NOT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE AS MISS FATHER AVAILABLE. YES I'M HERE UP IN THAT IS MISS FABRE MISS ROBINSON. I'M SORRY- THIS IS TRACY FATHER ALL RIGHT THIS FATHER IF YOU GO AHEAD TWO MINUTES EACH PLEASE. GOOD EVENING CHAIRMAN AMERICANS SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS TRACY CALLER. AND I'M A LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF YOLO COUNTY CASA AN ORGANIZATION THAT ADVOCATES FOR THE BEST INTERESTS OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT OF CHILDREN. HEY WE UNDERSTAND THE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT OF BRAINS AND BODIES OF CHILDREN BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE WE KNOW THAT TRAUMATIC STRESS IN EARLY CHILDHOOD. AS A RESULT OF ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES OR ACES. HAS A PROFOUNDLY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF CHILDREN AND THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFE COURSE. THE GROUND BREAKING ACES STUDY PUBLISHED IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT BY DOCTORS AND PALLADIA HI THERE PERMANENTLY AND ROBERT HONDA OF THE PVC AND SUBSEQUENT RESEARCH AROUND TRAUMATIC STRESS IN CHILDREN. HAVE DRAMATICALLY HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF REDUCING THE EXPOSURE AND DOSE OF TRAUMATIC STRESS CHILDREN EXPERIENCE. F. B. FIFTY FOUR WILL ENSURE THE COURT TAKE THIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF TRAUMATIC STRESS THE CHILDREN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN TAKING THEIR TESTIMONY IN FAMILY COURT. OR WHEN MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT UNSUPERVISED VISITATION IN CASES WHERE EVIDENCE OF THE EXTENT. ENSURING THAT CHILDREN ARE NOT JUST PHYSICALLY BUT ALSO EMOTIONALLY SAFE DURING COURT PROCEEDINGS AND THE SEPARATION OF THEIR PARENTS. IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THEIR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM WELL BEING. KAFER ADVOCATES WHOSE COMPANY CHILDREN TO COURT HAVE A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON THE TOXIC STRESS THAT CHILDREN EXPERIENCE WHEN APPEARING IN COURT. EVEN WHEN SPEAKING UP FOR THEIR NEEDS. IF IT MAY BE PERCEIVED AS AGAINST THE WISHES OR DESIRES OF THE- YES CHILDREN ARE FREQUENTLY VERY WILLING TO BE OPEN AND HONEST. ABOUT HOW THEY FEEL OR WHAT THEY WANT WHERE THEY FEEL SAFE. IT IS TIME FOR THE ADULTS IN THE ROOM TO CREATE THE RIGHT CONDITIONS FOR THE CHILD RATHER THAN EXPECT THE CHILD TO ADAPT TO THE CONDITIONS. SET BY THE ADULTS IN THE ROOM IT IS TIME pTHOSE WHO WOULD ABUSE THEM THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION THANK YOU MISS FABRE DISMISS ROBINSON ON THE PHONE. YES I AM CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW- WE CAN GO AHEAD MISS ROBINSON. RIGHT THANK YOU I CHAIR ON BURKE AND SENATORS I AM A FAMILY LAW ATTORNEY WITH OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. AND I HAVE MORE THAN SYDNEY LEAVE MORE THAN MY FAIR SHARE OF HIGH CONFLICT FAMILY LAW CASES THAT INVOLVE. ISSUES OF CHILD CUSTODY WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CHILD ABUSE ALLEGATIONS- THIS BILL WOULD DO TWO IMPORTANT THINGS THE FIRST IS IT WOULD AMEND THE FAMILY CODE SECTION THREE ZERO ONE ONE. TO REQUIRE THAT COURTS WHO ARE ALLOWING UNSUPERVISED CONTACT BETWEEN A CHILD AND A PARENT WITH A HISTORY OF ABUSE. THE COURT HAS TO FIRST ISSUE WRITTEN FINDINGS AS TO HOW SUCH AN ORDER IS IN THE CHILD'S BEST INTEREST HE AND- HELLO IT IS NOT DETRIMENTAL TO THE CHILD'S HEALTH SAFETY AND WELFARE. THAT CURRENT STATUTES OF FAMILY CODE SECTION THREE ZERO ONE ONE ALREADY REQUIRES COURTS TO MAKE THESE KINDS OF WRITTEN FINDINGS WHEN IT ISSUES ITS ORDERS FOR CUSTODY. HEDGE LEGAL AND PHYSICAL CUSTODY OF CHILDREN BUT SURPRISINGLY THIS FILE THE STATUTE IS SILENT ON THE ISSUE OF UNSUPERVISED VISITS IN THE CONTEXT OF- DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR ABUSE SITUATIONS- SECONDLY. THE BILL DOES- CREATE A FURTHER PROTECTION FOR THOSE FEW CHILDREN WH DO. PROVIDE TESTIMONY TO THE COURT FOR ARE INTERVIEWED BY THE COURT- IN THE PREFERENCE WOULD BE FOR CHILDREN TO BE INTERVIEWED IN CHAMBERS WITH THE COURT REPORTER PRESENT. OUTSIDE THE PRESENCE OF THEIR PARENTS- UNLESS THE COURT MAKES WRITTEN pTHE CHILD'S BEST INTEREST TO HAVE. THE CHILD'S PARENTS PRESENT DURING THE TESTIMONY- OVER IN MY MANY YEARS OF FAMILY LAW CASES. CHILDREN DO NOT TELL IT IS A SMALL MINORITY OF CASES WHERE CHILDREN ARE BROUGHT IN AND IN SOME INSTANCES IT IS BANNED BY SEWER SPONTANEOUS QUESTS FROM THE- FROM THE JUDGE HIM OR HERSELF ONE THANK YOU.

INDICATING THAT OF FOLKS WHO HAVE A DUTY TO CREATE INJURY PREVENTION PLAN- AND THAT THE INVESTIGATION BY LETTER WOULD PROCEDURE WAS TOO BURDENSOME.
