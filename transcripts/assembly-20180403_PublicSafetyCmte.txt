GOOD MORNING WELCOME TO ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY. WAITING FOR THE OTHER MEMBERS TO COME WE HAVE A FULL. REALLY FULL AGENDA SO WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND BEGIN AS A SUBCOMMITTEE AND I WILL ANNOUNCE THE FOLLOWING. ITEMS ARE OFF CALENDAR SO FEW HERE FOR THESE. THESE ITEMS THEY WILL NOT BE HEARD TODAY. OF ITEM NUMBER ONE A. B. NINETEEN ELEVEN LACKEY PULLED BY COMMITTEE. I'M ITEM NUMBER FIVE AB TWENTY TEN CHAO PULL BY COMMITTEE. ITEM AB TWENTY FOURTEEN EDUARDO GARCIA PULL BY AUTHOR. ITEM TWENTY THREE AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTEEN POLL BY AUTHOR. ITEM TWENTY FOUR AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY FOUR. PULL BY AUTHOR. SO WE WILL BEGIN AT THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND SENSE. MR LOW IS HERE AND SIGNED UP FIRST WE WILL BEGIN WITH HIM. ONE OF. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. FIRST LIKE TO START OFF BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND THAT YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMMITTEES EFFORTS AND WORK ON THIS. I MEMBERS GUN VIOLENCE IN THE UNITED STATES IS A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY LEADING TO OVER THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DEATHS EACH YEAR. AND APPROXIMATELY TWENTY TWO THOUSAND A SUICIDES RELATED TO FAR ARMS. EVERY YEAR. HAS APPROXIMATELY OF A FEW CALIFORNIA CITIES. EACH YEAR IT'S IMMORAL HOW MANY INNOCENT LIVES WE'VE LOST TO FIRE ON VIOLENCE. AND THIS BILL RESTRICTS FAR I'M POSSESSIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS AT RISK OF HARMING THEMSELVES OR OTHERS SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL WOULD. PERMANENTLY REMOVE FIREARMS FROM ANYONE PLACE PLATE THEN PLACED ON TWO FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLDS. WITHIN ONE YEAR. THE INDIVIDUAL COULD STILL PETITION TO HAVE A FIRE ARMS RETURN BUT THEY WOULD HAVE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS. THEMSELVES AND AUTHORIZE RELEASE OF THEIR MENTAL HEALTH RECORDS. TO THE APPROPRIATE COURT FOR REVIEW OF THEIR CASE ONE BE VERY CLEAR THAT. THE ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS THAT MADE IN THIS COMMITTEE WILL ALSO OPPOSED TO RIGHTS PROCESS. AND SURE THAT INDIVIDUAL CAN PETITION EVERY FIVE YEARS. WITH ME TODAY IS JOHN HOFFMAN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AND DOCTOR JORGE WONG BEHALF THAT CALIFORNIA'S PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION. GREAT THANK YOU AND AND BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY ITEMS ARE. LIMITED TO MINISTER TO MINUTES AND I'M GOING TO BE REALLY STRICT ABOUT THAT TODAY. SIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. SHAWN HOFFMAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT WERE IN FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE ON FIREARM ISSUES WE TEND TO STAY OUT OF THOSE BUT. A VERY DIRECT IMPACT ON PROSECUTORS WHEN SOMEONE IS. SUBJECT TO A FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLD AND DISCHARGED FROM A FACILITY. SUBJECT TO A FIVE YEAR PROHIBITION ON. THE PURCHASE POSSESSION OF FIREARMS. THEY CAN PETITION WHEN THEY FILED A PETITION TO GET THOSE WEAPONS BACK PETITION COMES TO DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WE REVIEW THAT PETITION AND DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO CHALLENGE IN THE GROUNDS FOR THE CHALLENGE WOULD BE THAT WE BELIEVE WE CAN PROVE BY A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE. THAT THAT PERSON IS LIKELY NOT TO USE FIREARMS SAFELY IN THE FUTURE. I IT'S A BURDEN THAT IS HONEST APPROVED IF WE DON'T MEET THAT BURDEN THE PERSON RACKETS THEIR FIREARMS BACK. THAT'S NOT THE BURDEN IN MANY OTHER STATES MANY OTHER STATES PUT THE BURDEN ON THE PETITIONER. IN CALIFORNIA IT'S ON US AND SO WHAT WE'RE SEEKING TO DO WITH AB NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT IS TO. MAKE SOME CHANGES THAT PROCESS THAT GIVE US TIME AND INFORMATION TO MAKE A KNOWLEDGEABLE AN APPROPRIATE DECISION WHEN WE'RE DECIDING HOW TO HANDLE THAT PETITION. EXTENDING THAT PERIOD OUT FROM THIRTY DAYS TO SIXTY DAYS FOR RESPONDING TO THE PETITION. MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH RECORDS. BY WAY OF THOSE WOULD COME INTO THE COURT THE COURT TO DETERMINE WHAT'S RELEVANT WE WOULD THEN GET TO SEE THOSE RECORDS. I AND THEN AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED WHEN SOMEONE SUBJECT TO TWO FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLDS WITHIN ONE YEAR. GOING FROM A FIVE YEAR PROBATION TO LIFETIME PROBATION. BUT BUILDING IN SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO COME BACK BEFORE THE COURT. PETITION EVERY FIVE YEARS TO POTENTIALLY GET THOSE WEAPONS BACK. UNDER THE PROCESS THAT THAT EXIST TODAY. STRUCTURALLY HOW THAT THAT PROCESS PLAYS OUT US WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A VERY COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO AN ISSUE THAT BUT CERTAINLY IS. UNFORTUNATELY ALL TOO FAMILIAR IN OUR SOCIETY. I'D ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. BOB DYLAN IS CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SHARE MY. EXPERIENCE WITH YOU SOMEBODY STUCK TO HER WHO ALSO PAST PRESIDENT FOR THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION. A FEW YEARS BACK AROUND TWO THOUSAND FIVE WAS ACTUALLY WORKING WITH A TWENTY THREE YEAR OLD. A FILIPINO WOMAN WHO WAS ACTUALLY.

A CONCLUSION TO THE LAST OF COURT HEARING WHERE SHE ALSO REALIZED THAT SHE WOULD ACTUALLY NOT BE ABLE TO REGAIN CUSTODY OF HER CHILD CARE FOR YOUR CHILD BECAUSE. SHE WAS SOMEWHAT INCONSISTENT WITH MEDICATION TREATMENT AS WELL AS THERAPY AND IN THE. PROFESSIONAL CAME A FINAL LIKES AND SHE WAS QUITE THE STRUCT. I MEAN THOSE HAVING PREPARED AND SUPPORTED FOR MANY MONTHS TO. COME TO THIS A PARTICULAR POINT. THREE DAYS LEADERS OF THE HEARING OUT SHE WAS ACTUALLY FOUND DEAD AS A RESULT OF A SELF INFLICTED GUNSHOT WOUND.

LACKEY I CARILLO. CARILLO AYE GONZALEZ FLETCHER. KILEY KILEY AYE QUIRK. SANTIAGO. SECONDLY DOT DID YOU MAY BEGIN. MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS KIRK CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. A. OUR MAJOR CONCERN WITH THIS BILL IS THE VAST SUITE OF. THE SCOPE OF THE LIMITATIONS THAT IT POSES OVER AND EXPENSE EXTENSIVE PERIOD OF TIME FOR INDIVIDUALS. TO BE PRECLUDED FROM OWNING A FIREARM POSSESSING A FIREARM AFTER A PERIOD OF A COMMITMENT WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED BY THE COMMITTEE AND WE THINK THAT GOES A LONG WAY. TO. A NUMBER OF OUR CONCERNS OUR LARGEST CONCERN CONTINUES TO BE THAT THERE IS OFTEN A STEREO TYPE DEBTS ARE DRAWN BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS WHO SUFFER FROM MENTAL ILLNESSES AND. VIOLENCE AND PARTICULARLY WITH GUN VIOLENCE AND WE WOULD ASSERT THAT THIS BILL CONTINUES TO PERPETUATE THAT. BIAS AND AND IT'S IMPORTANT NOT ONLY FOR THE ISSUE OF GUN VIOLENCE IT'S TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT. SEATS OVER INTO OTHER AREAS SUCH AS EMPLOYMENT SUCH AS HOUSING SUCH AS OTHER CIVIL RIGHTS. AND SO WE WOULD. OPPOSE THE BILL FOR. FOR THAT REASON BUT DO APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS. THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS PROPOSED THANK YOU AND. GOOD MORNING LISTA BEACON WHAT THEY SELL YOU A CALIFORNIA PERSONALLY WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL AS WELL AND ALSO APPRECIATE THE A MAN'S AND THAT THAT OFFER THAT HAS TAKEN AND WE THINK THAT THIS IS DEFINITELY A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. ON BUT WE DO REMAIN OPPOSED AND OUT OF THE CLEAR THAT THEY SO YOU CALIFORNIA DOES NOT OPPOSE GUN CONTROL MEASURES THAT SUPPORT PUBLIC SAFETY AND PROTECT PUBLIC WELFARE. I'M WE ARE SUPPORTED OR WE DO WE DO NOT OPPOSE UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS PERMITS I'M WAITING PERIODS. OR THE AUTHORIZATION PROTECTIVE ORDERS TO REMOVE GUNS FROM PEOPLE WHO POSE A RISK FROM THIS TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS. PROVIDED THEIR NON DISCRIMINATORY CRITERIA FOR GOOD FOR FINDING A PERSON AS. AS A DANGER. I UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL. REQUIRES A LIFETIME BAN ONLY ON PEOPLE WITH A HISTORY OF MENTAL ILLNESS AND AS. MR CHILD HAS SAID IT STIGMATIZES PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS IT PERPETUATES THIS HARMFUL AND FALSE STEREOTYPE THAT SUCH PEOPLE ARE INHERENTLY VIOLENT AND DANGEROUS. THE REALITY IS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO COMMIT VIOLENT CRIMES I DO NOT HAVE MENTAL ILLNESS AND SO NOT ONLY. IS THIS BILL UNFAIRLY STIGMATIZING BUT ALSO AND WOULD BE INEFFECTIVE AT ACTUALLY ADDRESSING VIOLENT CRIME. SO YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO APPRECIATE THE OF MAN'S BUT WE THINK. ANOTHER STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AT A BETTER APPROACH WOULD BE TO ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO INITIATE AN ACTION TO EXTEND THE BAN. SAID THAT WITH THE BURDEN WOULD FALL ON THE GOVERNMENT RATHER THAN. THAT PRESUMING THAT A PERSON IS FOREVER UNFIT JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE A HISTORY OF THE OVEN MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE. SO AGAIN THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THIS WOULD PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND AND SO WE WE DO REMAIN OPPOSED. THANK YOU THANK YOU OR ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OKAY ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MR LOW YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR ABOUT. IF YOU. THEIR MOTION. THEIR SECOND. OKAY OF SLOTH LE. THANK YOU FOR FOR TAKING AMENDMENT. IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE IN CONSIDERATION WHAT THE OPPOSITION. HAS SAID NIGHT. AND IF THERE IS ANYTHING ELSE AS WE HOPEFULLY GET OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE WE. WE MOVE FORWARD IF THERE'S ANY LANGUAGE THAT COULD HELP PROTECT. MR LOWERED BEEN VERY VERY COOPERATIVE ON THIS MATTER AND I AM SURE HE'S WILLING. ON TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT. BUT WE. AS WE'VE SEEN WE DO NEED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH SOME OF PROTECTIONS. SPECIAL WITH PEOPLE ON THAT HAVE SOME CHALLENGES THAT. COULD BE. SAY DEFINITE AND BE GOOD COULD BE A DANGER TO THE PUBLIC SO WE GOT TO CHAIRED RECOMMENDED AYE VOTE. CULTURAL. MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ON A. B.

THE PAST TWO YEARS REQUEST FOR NEW CCW SET INCREASE IN MANY COUNTIES THE INCREASE IN YOU REQUEST A RENEWAL IS COMBINED WITH A RIGOROUS SCREENING PROCESS AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. CREATES A SIGNIFICANT ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN FOR MANY AGENCIES. THE TIMING OF THIS PROCESS POSES A HUGE BURDEN ON AGENCIES WITH LIMITED STAFF RESOURCES.

ANY WITNESSES OPPOSITION A GOOD MORNING AMANDA WILCOX WITH THE. TWENTY EIGHT CALIFORNIA CHAPTERS OF THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE. I AM I WILL BE BRIEF. THE OF THE DECISION TO CARRY A LOADED. HIDDEN GUN IN PUBLIC IS A VERY BIG RESPONSIBILITY THAT ARE POTENTIALLY CAN PUT THE GUN CARRYING INDIVIDUAL AND THE PUBLIC AT RISK. AND I THINK THE VERY LEAST WE CAN DO IN THAT SITUATION IS TO HAVE A REVIEW EVERY TWO YEARS TO MAKE SURE THAT COULD COST CONTINUES TO EXIST BECAUSE THAT SITUATION MAY CHANGE. AND THAT THE PERSON IS CONTINUES TO BE OF GOOD MORAL CHARACTER TO ME THAT'S THE LEAST WE CAN DO. I'VE HEARD THIS COMMITTEE SAY MANY TIMES THAT THE FACT THAT AS THE OPPOSITION HEARD MY OPPOSITION. ALWAYS SAYS IS THAT. THE SEAS. ARM THERE ARE OUR CCW LAWS ARE WORKING IN OUR STATE THERE HAVEN'T BEEN A BIG PROBLEM AND THE EXISTING LAW IS THAT THERE IS THE REVIEW EVERY TWO YEARS. CYBER SUGGESTS THAT WE CONTINUE WHAT IS WORKING I WILL NOTE THAT IN OTHER STATES THERE'S A LONG LIST OF CRIMES IN MISTY'S THAT HAVE BEEN DONE BY CCW HOLDERS. THERE ARE SOME IN OP FROM SACRAMENTO COUNTY. THAT WHERE THEY WERE LATER REVOKED THAT'S TRUE THEY WERE TRACKED BY THE LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT I THINK THIS IS A VERY LEASE A PRECAUTION THAT WE HAVE THE REVIEW. OF THE THE INTERMEDIATE COURSE OF TRAINING AT LEAST EVERY TWO YEARS. WE'VE SEEN IN OUR OWN IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY HERE. THE DIFFICULTY OF. HANDLING A FIREARM IN A VERY STRESSFUL SITUATION. AYE TO AIM PROBABLY NOT HIT. BYSTANDERS AND. AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED THERE CAN'T BE TOO MUCH TRAINING FOR THIS. FOR THAT RESPONSIBILITY LAS I URGE YOU KNOW VOTE. THANK YOU. ARE INDIA WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. REBECCA GONZALEZ VOLUNTEER WITH THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE SACRAMENTO CHAPTER ALSO IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU BUT ANY WITNESSES. ARNIE COMMENTS QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THE KILEY. I SELL EITHER SOME SORT OF STATE AUDIT ON THIS TOPIC IS THE AUTHOR ANY THE WITNESSES. NOTE THAT SHOWED. THANK YOU MISTER KILEY ESTHER I WASN'T AUDIT THAT WAS DONE. BUT IN LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE ON THREE COUNTIES. AND THAT WAS DONE A LAST YEAR AND DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTION ON THE AUDIT ITSELF. WELL I HEARD THAT THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO THE AUDIT SO IS THERE ANY. ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THIS. BUT NO THIS IS NOT A RESPONSE TO THE AUDIT THAT WAS THAT THAT WAS DONE NOW. I WILL SAY THE AUDIT CONCLUDED THAT THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS BACKLOG IN AND OF COURSE IF THAT IF WE WERE ABLE TO CONTINUE DIRECTORS PROCESS BUT EXTEND THE LIFE OF A CCW BUT THE TO TO LIVE LAW ABIDING. ME A PERSON. THAT THIS WOULD ADDRESS THAT ISSUE IN SOME WAY. THANK YOU. AND YOUR QUESTION. IT. YOU YOU MAY HELP ARE STRICTLY ESCRIBO. GREG UP MISTER FONG WE HAD. BRUCE. DISCUSSION ON THIS AND I'VE HAD A. A QUICK DISCUSSION WITHOUT. SOME SUPPORTERS NO HALL THERE. SOME THE NRA AND. INDIVIDUALS AND I WANTED TO CONTINUE THAT DISCUSSION I'VE HELPED. THAT WE WOULD HAVE HOST BONUS SO WE COULD TALK TO SOME OF THESE ISSUES. AND SO I'M GONNA RECOMMEND. THAT WE VOTE NO ON THIS. BOB I WILL GRANT RECONSIDERATION NAKED WE SHOULD. BECAUSE WE SHOULD CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION AND WHAT I PROPOSE TO YOU. WAS. SENSE LAW ENFORCEMENT NEEDS RESOURCES TO GO AHEAD AND CHECK TO SEE CW SWITCH TO PROVIDE THE FUNDING A RESOURCE TO SO YOU CAN. GET RID OF THAT BACKLOG SOME WE WE DID WOULD. WITH DNA AND WITH DNA KITS WOULDN'T EXTEND TIME TO LAW ENFORCEMENT EJECTED DNA KITS WE PROVIDE FUNDING SO WE COULD CLOSE THAT GAP SO WE CAN GET IT DONE. AND SO I I THINK THAT IS. THAT IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO LOOK INTO FOUND WE HAVE MEMBERS APPROPRIATIONS AND. NO DEFINITE TALK TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEE ABOUT GETTING A NUMBER FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT OF WHAT KIND OF RESOURCES AT THE KNEES AGAIN TAKE CARE THE BACKLOG. I THINK IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A STATE TO PROVIDE THAT FUNDING SO THAT WE CAN ELIMINATE DEBT THAT LOW AND SO THAT WE CAN CAN KEEP. TO SEE CW ARM POLICIES PROCEDURES THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. WHAT A SAVING BROKE DON'T FIX IT? WE SHOULD KEEP IT AS IS INSULT THAT I'M RECOMMENDING A NO VOTE. BUT AB NINETEEN THIRTY ONE THE MOTION IS TO PASS JONES SAWYER. NO JONES SAWYER NO LACKEY. LACKEY AYE KALLIO. CARILLO NO GONZALEZ FLETCHER. KILEY. KILEY AYE QUIRK. SANTIAGO. BUILT ON CALL THANK YOU. AND NOW WE HAVE. MISS RUBIO. I THINK AYE SONGS. XCF. AB TWENTY SEVEN OH ONE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. GOOD MORNING. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SEVEN TO ONE A BILL RELATING TO TIME I RECOVERY CENTERS AND SCHOOLS. MEDICAL RESEARCH ESTABLISHES THAT THOMAS CREATING NEGATIVE NEUROBIOLOGICAL RESPONSE IN A YOUNG PERSON'S DEVELOPING BRAIN YOUNG TRAUMA. VICTIMS SUFFERED REDUCE ABILITY TO FOCUS ORGANIZE AND PROCESS INFORMATION LEADING TO LOWER ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT DECREASED READING ABILITY AND INCREASE SCHOOL ABSENCES. CHILDREN AND YOUTH WHO ARE LOW INCOME MINORITY AND IMMIGRANT. YOUTH ARE DISAPPEAR DISPROPORTIONATELY MORE LIKELY THAN OTHERS TO BE EXPOSED TO COMMUNITY VIOLENCE ANOTHER DRAMATIC DRAMATIC EVENTS OR TWO MEDICS CIRCUMSTANCES MOREOVER CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN HIGH POVERTY NEIGHBORHOODS ARE OVERWHELMINGLY. CONCENTRATED IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT FAIL TO MEET THE EDUCATIONAL MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF TRAUMA IMPACTED STUDENTS. THAT'S EXACTLY IT XR BEER I CAN PRONOUNCE MY OWN WORDS. IT INCREASES THE EFFECTS OF TRAUMA AND UP TO BRIDGE. AND. LIMITS THE ABILITY OF THESE KIDS TO. TO LEARN. AB TWENTY SEVEN NO ONE WILL ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BY ENCOURAGING SCHOOLS TO DEVELOP TRAUMA INFORMED PRACTICES ON THE CAMPUS SAYS. THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE UPON APPROPRIATION AND THAT'S THE KEY UPON APPROPRIATION BY THE LEGISLATURE THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION BOARD TO ADMINISTRATE PROGRAM THAT WOULD A WORRIED GRANTS SCHOOL BASED CHARMER RECOVERY CENTERS. BIT BY INCENTIVIZING AND CREATING THE SENATORS IT IS MY HOPE THAT MORE STUDENTS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO VALUABLE EVIDENCE BASED. RESOURCES WHICH WILL INCREASE EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS AND IMPROVE THE OVERALL SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT WITH ME TODAY I HAVE ANDREA PERRY POLICY ADVOCATE FOR CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE. THE SPONSORS OF THE LEGISLATION WE ALSO HAVE MARTHA MERCHANT ON BEHALF OF CARDS SAN FRANCISCO AND JAMES ANDERSON ARC CO FOUNDER AND SOCIAL. IMPACT DIRECTOR AT THE YERBA MATE COMPANY. THANK YOU. SO YOU HAVE FOUR MINUTES BETWEEN THREE PEOPLE. SO OKAY TIME. HI GOOD MORNING. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS ANDREA CARRYING ON THE POLICY ADVOCATE FOR. WELL IS THAT CHAIR IN YOUR STAFF. FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS MEASURE CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE AIMS TO PROMOTE THAT EFFECTIVE CRIMINAL JUSTICE STRATEGIES. TO STOP THE CRIME AND CONSEQUENTLY BUILD HEALTH THAT HEALTHY AND THRIVING COMMUNITIES TODAY. A. B. TWENTY SEVEN A ONE IS THE BILL THAT WE ARE BRINGING BEFORE YOU AND EVEN THOUGH WE ARE CRIME REFORM ORGANIZATION WE ARE ALSO FOCUSING ON LIFTING THE VOICES OF CHILDREN WHO EXPERIENCE TRAUMA. I WILL GIVE THE REST OF MY TIME TO MY WITNESSES. HER MY NAME IS JAMES ANDERSON I'LL BE QUICK GOOD MORNING MEMBERS I'M I'M HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF HIS BILL I'M ALSO HERE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF. OF THE KIDS THAT COULD NOT BE HERE TODAY. AND I WANT TO SPEAK IT WITH SPECIFICITY VISIT THE THAT THE KIDS I'M SPEAKING ABOUT OR THE KIDS AND NEVER HAD A CHANCE. EITHER BECAUSE SOCIETY TOLD HIM SO OR EITHER BECAUSE THEIR ZIP CODE DETERMINE THE AXIS OF REACH THEY WOULD HAVE TO A RESOURCE. NOW. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE TO ME BECAUSE I WAS ONCE ONE OF THESE KIDS. WE TALK ABOUT SECOND CHANCES BUT WHAT ABOUT THE CHILDREN THE NEVER HAD A FIRST ONE TO BEGIN WITH. WHAT ABOUT THE KIDS I GREW UP IN A HOME THOSE VOTED ABUSE WHY WITNESSED ABUSE WERE I WAS ABUSING THAT I WENT TO A SCHOOL SYSTEM THAT TOLD ME I WAS ALSO GOING TO BE NOTHING? AND THEN I WENT TO A SCHOOL SYSTEM THAT ASSUME. THE EVERY I WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE EVERYTHING ELSE FIGURED OUT BECAUSE THE LACK OF RESOURCES SHOWED ME THAT. THE LACK OF RESOURCES TOLD ME THAT WHATEVER IS HAPPENING IN YOUR HOME IS NORMAL. AND THIS IS NOT A PLACE TO COME AND HELP YOU WITH THOSE ISSUES. SO AS A CHILD TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO I WAS OR WHAT I WAS TRYING TO ACHIEVE IN LIFE OR WHO ARE HOW TO EVEN SURVIVE. I FOUND MYSELF FALLING. IN LINE WITH THE ONLY THING I KNEW HOW TO DO WHICH WAS THE GANGS THAT PROVIDED THE SUPPORT AND THE LOVE THAT I THOUGHT EXISTED IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE I COULD NOT HAVE ACCESS TO IN SCHOOLS SO WE TALK ABOUT SAFETY AND PREVENTION. IT'S IRONIC THAT THE KIDS THAT ARE OFTENTIMES REAP THE MOST REPEAT VICTIMS BUT THE KIDS ARE OFTENTIMES THE MOST IN NEED OR THE ONE THAT HAD THE LEAST. AXIS CITIES RESOURCES. OVER AND OVER RECEIVED ITS SUFFERING. SO I COME TODAY IN SUPPORT. IN A BILL THAT I BELIEVE PROVIDES. ACCESS TO THE TRAUMA RECOVERY. AND RESOURCES NEEDED FOR THEM TO HAVE A FUTURE AND TO HAVE THAT FIRST CHANCE THAT WE ALL DESERVE. YOU. MEMBERS UMP MY NAME IS DOCTOR MARTHA MERCHANT AND I'M WITH. HEARTS HEALTHY ENVIRONMENTS RESPONSE TROHMAN SCHOOLS. WHICH IS A MULTI TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT THAT AIMS TO PREVENT. THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE TO INTERRUPT THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. AND THE IDEAS THAT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT MORE THERAPY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS WHOLE SCHOOL CHANGE A CHANGE IN THE CULTURE OF THE SCHOOL SO THAT. STUDENTS LIKE JAMES CAN. GO TO SCHOOL AND FEEL LIKE THIS IS A PLACE FOR ME THIS IS A PLACE WHERE I CAN GET HELP THIS IS A PLACE WHERE I CAN. A BECOME THE BEST ME THAT I THAT I WANT TO BE. THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT AIMS AT. RID. IMPROVING. EDUCATION FOR ALSO TEACHERS WERE TALKING ABOUT. THE. ADDRESSING CHRONIC TRAUMA AND STRESS ACROSS THE BOARD SO THERE'S A. A CULTURE SHIFT AT THE SCHOOL. M. AND THAT. THE IN THE ENVIRONMENT BECOMES A SAFE AND SUPPORTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT AND TEACHING ENVIRONMENT. SO THAT PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T HAVE A FIRST CHANCE OR COMING FROM A PLACE WHERE THEY NEED MORE THAN WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO GET AT HOME THEY CAN GET SOME OF THAT AT SCHOOL SO IT'S NOT ABOUT I'M SETTING UP MORE THERAPY SPACES IT'S ABOUT. CHANGING THE WAY THE SCHOOLS THE KIDS WHO HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY TRAUMA I'M EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BECAUSE WE ALSO KNOW THE COMMUNITY VIOLENCE IS A THING THAT HAPPENS TO KIDS WHO MAY BE GROWING UP IN PERFECTLY LOVING HOUSEHOLDS. AND I'M FEELING LIKE. WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH IS THE NORM AND AND I SHOULD JUST BE ABLE TO FIGURE IT OUT? IS TERRIFYING TO CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE ANSWERS. SO. WE REALLY ARE TALKING ABOUT BUILDING CAPACITY IN SCHOOLS WRAP IT UP YES WE'RE TRYING TO BUILDING CAPACITY IN SCHOOLS AND AND AND NOT JUST. THERE BE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE TROUBLE. THANK YOU. OF ANY WITNESSES INSOFAR OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. NAME AN ORGANIZATION. YOUR LITTLE AMONG FOLK ARE SOME OTHER TIME IN AGAINST GANGS COALITION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU.

CLEARLY AND VERY SUPPORTIVE OF OF THE PREMISE BEHIND YOUR BILL HERE. I WE WANT TO GIVE GREATER ACCESS TO TREATMENT FOR ALL THOSE WHO NEED IT. I DO HOWEVER HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE BREADTH OF THE BILL AND SOME OF THE VERY BROAD LANGUAGE. THIS BILL TARGETS THE VICTIM'S RESTITUTION FINES. AS IT'S A. FUNDING SOURCE WHICH IS PROBLEMATIC FOR TWO REASONS. OF THE FUND IS DWINDLING RAPIDLY. AND RESEARCH INSOLVENCY IN JUST A FEW SHORT YEARS. AND THE BILL LANGUAGE DOES NOT SPECIFY THE BOOKS BEING TREATED. ARE TRULY VICTIMS OF CRIME. WHICH LEADS TO PROBLEMS WITH FEDERAL FUND MATCHING. AND THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS. ARE ANY OF. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENT. YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU. MISTER AND MISTER LACKEY YES. I APPRECIATE BUT THE COMMENTS AND WHERE WORKING DILIGENTLY TO TRIUMPH OF FIND A DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCE BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISH THE THE FRAMEWORK. SO THAT WE HAVE THESE.

AND TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. BEGIN. BOB THANK YOU I CAN BE BRIEF I'M ALSO HERE ON BEHALF AMANDA WILCOX AS OF SEVEN THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE. I'M ALSO HERE ON BEHALF OF GIFFORD'S LAW CENTER WERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THE ENTERING OF ALL. RECOVER GUNS TO PROTECT THE CRYING GUNS INTO ULTIMATELY ATF'S TRACE IN CALIFORNIA WE DO THAT FIRST. BY DATA BEING ENTERED INTO DOJ'S AUTOMATED FIRED SYSTEM THAT'S BEEN A PRIORITY POLICY ISSUE FOR OUR NATIONAL BRADY CAMPAIGN. AS WELL AS OUR CHAPTERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN OUR COALITION IN CALIFORNIA. TRACE IS IMPORTANT FOR FOR REASONS ONE IS TO GET LEADS. INVESTIGATIVE LEADS ON INDIVIDUAL CRIME GUNS TWO IS TO IDENTIFY GUN TRAFFICKING PATTERNS KNOW WHERE COMMUNITIES COMING FROM AND ARE THERE. PARTICULAR GUN DEALERS SO CALLED BAD APPLE GUN DEALERS THAT SUPPLY SO MANY OF THESE CRIME GUNS IN TWO THOUSAND IN YEAR TWO THOUSAND I BELIEVE IT WAS. TRACE DATA FOUND THAT ONE GUN DEALER WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR HALF OF THE CRIME GUNS IN OAKLAND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THOSE PATTERNS AND WE FORMER SHUT DOWN THOSE DEALERS. THEN IN CALIFORNIA I'M GETTING THAT INFORMATION INTO A F.* IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR OUR ARMED PROHIBITIVE PERSON SYSTEM PROGRAM WHICH RELIES ON GOOD DATA FOR CROSS CHECKING FIREARM OWNERS IN A FS. WITH. PEOPLE WHO HAVE BECOME PROHIBITED AND AS YOU KNOW DOJ GOES TO DISARM THOSE PEOPLE WHAT DOJ AS FINE AS THEY GO TO DISARM. A PERSON WHO'S IN APPS AND THEY DISCOVER THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT ALREADY HAD BEGUN BUT THEY DIDN'T AND HURT TO SYSTEM SO IT REALLY INTERFERES WITH THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR APPS PROGRAM AND BRINGING DOWN THE BACKLOG. IN THE FINALLY NEXT YEAR OUR AMMO BACKGROUND CHECKS SYSTEMS GOING INTO PLACE. WHERE A FS THAT DATABASE IS COMPARE WITH APPS OF SOMEONE HAS A GUN REGISTERED TO THEM AND THEY'RE NOT IN NAPS AND THEY'RE GOOD TO GO AND FIND AMMUNITION WELL THE PAY PERSON MAY NOT ACTUALLY HAVE THE GUN IT SHOULD NOT BE REGISTERED TO THEM? LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS IT SO AGAIN IF THAT DATA IS NOT ACCURATE AND KEPT UPDATED. OF THEIR COULD BE IN RHODIA'S AMMUNITION CELL SO WE WANT GOOD DATA IN DOJ SYSTEMS WE WANT CRIME GUNS TRACED SO WE CAN SOLVE THESE CRIMES IDENTIFY. THE CORRUPT GUN DEALERS. SUCH IMPORTANT POLICY ISSUE IT HAS BEEN LAW IN CALIFORNIA THAT SHE'S. CHAIR DEPARTMENTS ENTER THE DATA THAT'S VERY SPOTTY IN OUR STATE SOME DO SOME DON'T ALL. OUR IN HOUSE AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES DO NOT HAVE THE REQUIREMENT THEY MAY BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE TO OBVIOUSLY WE WANT ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO DO THIS. AND WE WANT OUGHT TO BE DONE IN A TIMELY WAY SO THE INFORMATION'S MORE ACTIONABLE ALSO I KNOW IT'S HUMAN NATURE IF THERE'S NO TIMELINE YOU CAN DO IT ANYTIME SOMETIMES YOU NEVER DO IT. SO WE WANT OUR INCREASED TRACING IN OUR STATE. URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. OR ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

A LAW THAT WE COME UP WITH AND THEY AGREE WITH WHAT WE'RE DEALING AND THEY'VE GIVEN US. SOME ASSURANCES THAT THEY CAN GET IT DONE DESIST AWAY. EVERY BILLS SHOULD BE DONE SO. I AM TUESDAY AFTER GLEE AS EVERYONE FOR AN AYE VOTE. BUT AB TWENTY TO TWENTY TWO THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. JOBS ARE I LACKEY. LACKEY I CARILLO CARILLO AYE GONZALEZ FLETCHER. KILEY. KILEY AYE QUIRK. AYE QUIRK AYE SANTIAGO. SANTIAGO AYE. THE MEASURE PASSES. SO MISTER HARPER. YOU SIGNED A LITTLE EARLIER. AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY THREE. AND IF I MAY ASK THE CHAIR WE HAD THE A SHARE FROM SHASTA COUNTY ARRIVE WITH US WOULD IT. BE OKAY WITH THE CHAIR TO HAVE THREE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR SHOULD WE LIMIT TO HAVE FOUR MINUTES AND. THAT'S IT MEN SO WHATEVER WAY YOU WANT TO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY THREE THIS BILL WOULD REMOVE THE MICROSCOPIC REQUIREMENT FOR NEW MODEL HANDGUNS TO BE CERTIFIED FOR SALE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. MICROSCOPIC A HANDGUN INVOLVES THE IMPRINTING OF A MICROSCOPIC ARRAY OF CHARACTERS THAT IDENTIFY THE MAKE MODEL AND SERIAL NUMBER OF THE HANDGUN. CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY REQUIRES THAT A HANDGUN IS IN PREGNANT CHORE MORE PLACES ON THE INTERIOR SERVICE OR ON THE WORKING PART OF THE GUN. STATE ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE IDENTIFYING CHARACTERS ARE TRANSFERRED ONTO EACH CARTRIDGE CASE WHEN THE FIREARM INSPIRED. WHEN THIS OUT WELL THIS SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT WAY TO BE ABLE TO TRACK DOWN FIREARMS WITH THE BULLETS THEY'RE SHOT FROM THEM THE PROBLEMS AT THE MICROSCOPIC TECHNOLOGY IS NOT VIABLE. THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE MICROSTATE APPEAR TWICE ON THE FIREARMS CASING IS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCOMPLISH. IN ADDITION SCIENCES CONFIRMED THAT THE MARKS LEFT BY THE INTERNAL COMPONENTS OF A GUN THAT ARE ALTERED FROM NORMAL USE WHICH MAKES THE MICROSCOPIC USELESS. IF TECHNOLOGY WAS BOUGHT AT THE TECHNOLOGY WAS VIABLE A CRIMINAL COULD EASILY FILED DOWN THE MARKER STAMP AND ELIMINATE ITS PURPOSE. FOR THE REASONS FOR THESE REASONS GUN MANUFACTURERS HAVE YET TO EVEN IMPLEMENT THIS TECHNOLOGY SINCE NEW HANDGUNS ARE UNABLE TO BE MICRO STAMPED IN ACCORDANCE WITH CALIFORNIA LAW FOR AT LEAST THE LAST FIVE YEARS. THAT HAS A LIMITED A BILL A LIMITED THE ABILITY FOR CONSUMERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO EXERCISE AND FIND THEIR OF FIND A FIREARM FOR THEIR PERSONAL PROTECTION. THIS BILL IS NEEDED TO EXPAND THE AVAILABILITY OF AFFORDABLE RELIABLE HANDGUNS WHILE PRESERVING CURRENT SAFE HANDGUN CERTIFICATIONS WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY THREE. IS DAN READ FROM THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION SAM PRAISE FROM THE DONORS ARE GUN OWNERS OF CALIFORNIA AS A STATED A. TOM BUT CINCO THE SHERIFF CORNER OF SHASTA COUNTY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD THE AND READ. I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEANT FOR. US BRING THIS REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION AS HE STATED MICRO STEPPING TECHNOLOGY. HAS SERVED AS A BAND AIDS STYMIED. THE AVAILABILITY OF NEW MODEL SEMI AUTOMATIC FIREARMS TO THE HANDGUN ROSTER SINCE IT WAS CERTIFIED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. NO MANUFACTURE HAS IMPLEMENTED THIS THIS TECHNOLOGY. AND STUDIES HAVE CONSISTENTLY CONCLUDED THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS NOT VIABLE EVEN THE. THE CREATOR IN THE PATENT HOLDER OF THIS TECHNOLOGY AYE MR LUSARDI HIMSELF ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE'S LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS. REGARDING BOTH THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS IS WELL AS PRODUCTION COSTS IN THE DATABASE MANAGEMENT THAT WOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH MICROSCOPIC. YOU SEAT OF IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS YES ENGRAVING. THE MAKE MODEL SERIAL NUMBER CALDERON THE FIRING PIN THESE HAVE TO BE OPTIMIZED AND EVEN IN. LABORATORY CONDITIONS WITH SOPHISTICATED MICROSCOPES THIS TECHNOLOGY WAS NOT RELIABLY IMPRINTING AND THAT ONE OF THE STUDIES EVEN TALKS ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU NEED. POSSIBLY TEN SHELL CASINGS TO EVEN COME UP WITH THE FULL CODE THAT WENT ALONG AND TO IDENTIFY DID THE FIREARM. AND MOST FOR A CRIME I JUST DON'T HAVE THIS TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY IN AGAIN. IT'S. IT'S JUST NOT RELIABLE EVEN IN THOSE OPTIMIZE SITUATIONS AND CAN EASILY BE DEFEATED WITH WITH A FILE OR SOME HOUSEHOLD GOOD WITH THE SHERIFF WILL TALK ABOUT. CALIFORNIANS WHO SHOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO A LOT THAT'S JUST NOT RELIABLE. AND FOR THAT WE THINK THERE ASSEMBLYMAN. FOR BRINGING THIS AND WE URGE AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THE BOARD THOMAS CYCLE CHEST COUNTY SHERIFF. I SUPPORT THIS BILL AND ENCOURAGING AYE VOTE AS THE. WITNESS AND ALTER HAVE STATED MANY REASONS FOR THIS IT ALSO LIMITS THE ABILITY FOR MANUFACTURERS TO PROVIDE FIREARMS. TO THE CITIZENS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND FOR CITIZENS TO OBTAIN THE FIREARMS OF THE MICRO STAMPING IS EASILY DEFEATED EITHER JUST DUE TO NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR. ON THE END OF A FIRING PIN WHICH IS LIKE THE DIAMETER OF A PIECE OF THE PENCIL LEAD. THAT IT CAN ALSO BE INTENSELY REMOVED VERY EASILY WITH ABRASIVE SUCH AS EMERY CLOTH OR FILE OR A FINGERNAIL FILE. YOU'D ALSO SEED A CRIME SCENE WITH OBTAINING MICRO STAMPED. BRASS. LEAVING IT THERE TO BELIEVE SOME TYPE OF. OF REASONABLE DOUBT OF WHO COMMITTED THAT CRIME AND SO FOR THESE REASONS AND OTHERS. IF THEY WANTED TO COMMIT A CRIME THEY COULD USE A REVOLVER WHICH DOES NOT. EL EXPEL THE BRASS INTO A CRIME SCENE BUT STILL STAYS WITHIN THE CYLINDER SO FOR THESE REASONS AYE ENCOURAGING AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL. I THINK MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GIVEN LIMITED TIME I WANNA PUT OUT A COUPLE OF THINGS MANUFACTURES HAVE NOT REJECTED THE USE OF THEM. THEY SAY THAT IF THEY DO USE IT BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTIES AND THE PROBLEMS WITH THAT THEY COULD BE SUED OUT OF EXISTENCE IF THEY MAKE ONE MISTAKE. IMPAIRING HIM A A FIRING PIN TO A PARTICULAR FRAME. IF. IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS IN THE ASSEMBLY PROCESS IN CUSTOMIZING PROCESS THOSE THINGS GET MESSED UP THEY'RE GOING TO BE SUED OUT OF EXISTENCE. NO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY HAS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. BY THE GUNS THAT DON'T HAVE THIS THAT ALL THE CITIZENS DON'T. CANNOT GET BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ON THE APPROVED LIST BECAUSE OF MICRO STAMPING. BECAUSE THEY ARE SAFER MORE EFFICIENT MORE COST EFFECTIVE. CITIZENS SHOULD BE AFFORDED THE SAME. PRIVILEGE OR RIGHT MICHAEL STAMPING IS ONE TWENTY SIX THAT THICKNESS OF A HAIR. THAT'S WHAT THE IMPRESSION IS ON THE FIRING PIN. IT CAN BE REMOVED VERY EASILY IT REMOVES ITSELF. WITH CONTINUED USE. AND THEN IT'S IT'S IT'S GONE BUT THAT HAS PREVENTED. SAFE. INEXPENSIVE. OUR MODERN FIREARMS FROM BEING ABLE TO BE SOLD THEY STILL HAVE THAT LOADED CHAMBER INDICATORS MAGAZINE DISCONNECT THEY HAVE TO BE DROPPED THAT SIX FEET ON CONCRETE THEY CAN ACCIDENTALLY GO OFF. THEIR VERY SAFE GUNS AND THIS PROVISION THAT REQUIRES A TECHNOLOGY THAT NOBODY. IN THOUGH WORLD USES. AS A MATTER OF FACT NO MANUFACTURE HAS PURCHASED THE MILLION DOLLAR MACHINERY THAT IT WHICH IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO HAVE THIS CAPABILITY AND FINALLY. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE. TO FOLLOW THIS LAW BECAUSE YOU CANNOT. IMPRESS THAT. EVEN IF YOU COULD TO IT SUCCESSFULLY YOU CANNOT IMPRESSIVE IN TWO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS ON A CASE. IT CANNOT BE DONE. THAT'S WHY. LIZOTTE ABANDONED HIS PATENT WHICH MADE IT AVAILABLE FOR FOR THE OF THE. ODD. AT AT CERTIFICATION BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR THOSE REASONS SEN AND OTHERS WE ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL CONSIDER THIS MEASURE WHERE SUPPORT. THAT IT'S A RARE OCCASION AWARENESS ALVARADO WHERE WE'RE HERE AND. ASK YOUR SUPPORT AND IF WE GET IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THE TECHNOLOGIES WE'RE HERE TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS THANK YOU. ARE ANY OHER. MEMBERS AND ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT NAMING ORGANIZATION OR GRIFFITH ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA RIFLE PISTOL ASSOCIATION STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU TERM THANK YOU. A ONE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. THEN AMANDA WILCOX ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTERS OF THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT COME VIOLENCE TODDLERS ARE ACTUALLY ABANDON THE PATENT BECAUSE HE SAW THE PUBLIC SAFETY BENEFITS AND HE WANTED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN. HE WAS NOT INTERESTED IN MAKING MONEY TO. MONEY OFF OF THIS IT TOOK AWHILE TO GET THE PATENTS UNENCUMBERED BECAUSE I'M THE NOTES TO HIM THE GUN LOBBY RENEW THE PATENT. SO THAT'S THE HISTORY ON THAT ALLOW THESE ARGUMENTS I HEARD WHEN WE FIRST PASSED THE BILL IS A PRIORITY BILL FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTERS. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN'S WHEN IT WAS ENACTED. AT THAT TIME WE MADE THE POINT ABOUT THE NUMBER OF. GUN CRIME TWO WORDS ON SOFT PARTICULARLY AFTER DRIVE BY SHOOTINGS WHERE THE ONLY EVIDENCE LEFT ARE WHERE THE BULLET CASINGS THE CARTRIDGE CASINGS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE. AND THE IDEA IS TO HAVE INTENTIONAL MARKS THAT WILL LINK THOSE CASINGS ARE TO THE GUN WHERE THEN THE. THE RANDOM. BALLISTIC EVIDENCE THAT WOULD BE THERE OTHERWISE. AND THAT NEED OF COURSE TO SOFT ON CRIME IS STILL THERE. ARMY MY ITEM WHEN. THAT LEGISLATION WAS PASSED TO REQUIRE NEW HANDGUNS NEW MODELS OF HANDGUNS TO HAVE CHAMBER LOAD INDICATORS A MAGAZINE DISCONNECT AND THE GUN DESERVES INDUSTRY SAID WE CANNOT DO IT. AND WE WILL NOT DO IT AND THEY DIDN'T FOR NUMBER OF YEARS AND THEN FINALLY ONE MANUFACTURE DECIDED TO AND THEN WE SAW THOSE KIND GUNS COME ONLINE. I SUSPECT THIS WILL BE THE SAME THING BUT WE'LL SEE. ARE THIS IS RIGHT NOW PENDING IN THE COURT ABOUT WHETHER. THE CAN BE DONE OR NOT MY SUGGESTION IS TO LET THE COURTS PROCESS PLAY OUT LET THEM DECIDE. BUT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY'RE SUCH RESISTANCE TO ADDING THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL HELP US SOLVE CRIME AND SAVE LIVES ASK YOU TO OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE LEADING THE WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. AMANDA COULD DO WAS WILCOX YOU STAY ARE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MISTER QUIRK. YES I'M. MS WILCOX ARM. WHAT ABOUT THIS QUESTION THAT THE TIME STAMP CAN BE FILED OFF? IT PROBABLY CAN. I MEAN THERE'S WELL LIGHTED THAT. IT IS A REAL CONCERN WELL YOU KNOW WATCHING THAT WOULD BE PART OF THE COURT CASE. YOU KNOW I REMEMBER HAVING THIS CONVERSATION WITH. THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE NAY TALKED ABOUT THE NUMBER OF TIMES A CRIMINAL LEAVES A CRIME SCENE WITHOUT REMOVING THEIR LICENSE PLATES THERE'S THE ARGUMENT THAT PEOPLE GO TO. GO. YOU KNOW SCOOP UP. CASINGS AND ARRANGE THEN TAKE IMPLANET AT A CRIME SCENE I MEAN I SUPPOSE THOSE THINGS COULD HAPPEN. GENERALLY CRIMINALS DON'T TAKE THAT. NO BAD AT THAT KIND OF ACTION TO HAVE. TO EVADE DETECTION BUT SURE I THINK IT COULD BE DEFERRED DEFEATED THAT WAY. IF SOMEONE TOOK THAT EFFORT. BUT I MEAN THAT'S TRUE WITH LOTS OF THINGS. WELL AGAIN IT SEEMS THIS IS A VERY TECHNICAL QUESTION THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO ANSWER TO DAY AND I DO SUGGEST THAT WE LEAVE IT TO THE COURT'S THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU MAKE CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH A MISTER CHAIR. I. WHEN I LEFT UP TO THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS I'M OF THE BELIEVER THAT LEGISLATION IS PREFERABLE TO LITIGATION IN TERMS OF DECIDING POLICY CHOICES. THE REASON FOR THIS PER OUR REASON FOR THIS BILL IS SIMPLE. I THE MICROSTATE UPPING REQUIREMENT WAS PASSED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN ARE BASED ON HIGH HOPES BUT UNFORTUNATELY TECHNOLOGY HASN'T BARED OUT. THE MICR STAMPING REQUIREMENT CHILLS MARKET FORCES AND LIMITS THE POOL TECHNOLOGY. TO OF TECHNOLOGICALLY SUPERIOR FIREARMS TO CALIFORNIANS THE BILL REVERSE THIS THE REMOVAL OF THE MICROSCOPIC MANDATE WILL EXPAND THE AVAILABILITY OF AFFORDABLE. RELIABLE. HANDGUNS WHILE PRESERVING. CURRENT SAFE HANDGUN CERTIFICATIONS I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALL THOSE WHO SPOKE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GIVE THEIR PERSPECTIVES ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC AND OF THIS. ISSUE THEY CAN EASILY BE RESOLVED BY THE STATE LEGISLATURE. CALIFORNIA'S MADE IT SAFER AND MORE RELIABLE HANDGUNS THAT CAN BE OUR CALIFORNIA SHOULD MAKE IT. SAFER MAKE SAFER MORE LEVEL HANDGUNS. TO BE ABLE TO BE SOLD HERE FOR PERSONAL PROTECTION. REQUIREMENT THE HANDGUNS BE MICRO STAMPED IS SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE IN TODAY'S MARKET WITH TODAY'S TECHNOLOGY. THIS BILL WILL LIMIT THE MICROSTATE BANG REQUIREMENT ALLOW NEWER AND SAFER HANDGUNS TO BE SOLD IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE IN THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. AND UP. DID NOT I APPRECIATE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT AND NOT THINK MISTER QUIRK HAS A HAS A VALID. QUESTION ON YOUR YOUR STATEMENT ABOUT LEGISLATION VERSUS COURT ORDERS. IF IT WASN'T FOR BROWN VERSUS BOARD OF EDUCATION OVEN MONEY USC. ITSELF SOMETIMES A COURT CASES. BETTER THAT LEGISLATION. AND SO I'M GONNA RECOMMEND NO VOTE BECAUSE I ALSO WANT COURT CASE TO PAN OUT. I THINK THEY'RE GOING INTO DETAIL WHICH IS WHAT MR QUIRK IS TALKING ABOUT. FIVE MANUFACTURING WAS NOT TO MEET DONE. THE WHOLE ISSUE OF FILING. KUTCHER FILING IS TO SHIFT INTO DEFILING GUNS RIGHT NOW FILING OFF DHEA. THAT THAT SERIAL NUMBER SO THAT. THAT ENOUGH CRIME FLAT DUTCH. DONE ANYWAY AND WE STILL REQUIRE. SERIAL NUMBERS ON GUNS WE DIDN'T ABANDON SO OF. UNREGULATED A NO VOTE AND. MCCULLOUGH RULE. IT'S NO MOST. YEAH. IT WAS A BIT. IT WAS NOT DELIBERATE. AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY THREE THE MOTION IS TO PASSED THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER NO LACKEY. LACKEY I CARILLO. ON AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY THREE. GOTTA YOUR. GALIANO GONZALEZ FLETCHER. KILEY. QUIRK NO SANTIAGO. SOME NEVER KNOW. A MEASURE PASSES. A FAILED FROM TARA FAILED OPEN SO I KNOW. IT I I DID THE SAME THING SO. MR VIA MY GOOD FRIEND WE'RE. WHAT ALTERNATE UNIVERSES TODAY? YOU'RE OF HERE WITH THAT WITH YOUR A CONSIDERATION LIKE TO RESPECTFULLY ASK RECONSIDERATION IF A LOT GRANTED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BY UNANIMOUS CONSENT. SO. I MISTER KILEY HE AT HIS A WITNESS THAT NEEDS TO GO. AND. AND I'M PASS THROUGH BECAUSE I NEED TO GO PRESENT COULD COMMITTEE. SOMA PASS IT TO MISTER LACKEY. AND. I'M SORRY. THEY ALSO GOOD WOOD MISTER TING. YOU MAY PROCEED. GOOD MORNING AT MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE FIFTY SIX IS A VITAL MEASURE TO COMPLEMENT OTHER IMPORTANT STEPS THAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS TAKEN TO COMBAT HUMAN SEX TRAFFICKING. SEX TRAFFICKING IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST RAPIDLY SPREADING CRIMES AND THIS PARTICULARLY PREVALENT IN CALIFORNIA. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE CASES OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING REPORTED IN CALIFORNIA AND OF THOSE CASES ONE THOUSAND FIFTY ONE. WERE SEX TRAFFICKING CASES IN SOME COUNTIES THE CRIME IS GROWING AT A NEAR EPIDEMIC RATE. THE GROWTH OF THESE NUMBERS HAS PERHAPS BEEN AIDED BY OUR CRIMINAL CODES COUNTERINTUITIVE TREATMENT OF THIS DEVASTATING CRIME. HUMAN SEX TRAFFICKING IS AN OFFENSE WITH VIOLENCE AT ITS CORE YET IT IS NOT CONSIDERED A SERIOUS OR VIOLENT CRIME UNDER CURRENT LAW. THIS MEANS THAT MANY SEX TRAFFICKERS COULD BE RELEASED FROM PRISON AFTER SERVING ONLY HALF THEIR SENTENCE IT ALSO MEANS THE RELEASED AFTER ONLY SERVING A SENTENCE FOR ONE VICTIM. REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY VICTIMS THERE WERE CONVICTED OF TRAFFICKING. AB TWO THREE FIVE SIX WOULD FIX THIS ANOMALY WOULD SIMPLY ADD A SEX TRAFFICKING TO THE LIST OF CRIMES THEY'RE CONSIDERED. A VIOLENT FELONY I WOULD I THINK SENATOR GALGIANI FOR JOINING ME AS A CO AUTHOR AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE. JOINING YOU TODAY ARE WAS AT SUITOR WITH THE EL DORADO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WHERE SHE IS THE TEAM LEADER. FOR THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT IN CHARGE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AS WELL AS I CRISTINA DUARTE WITH STAND UP PLUS. MAY I PROCEED THINK YOU THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR HEARING US TODAY. NO SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH SICK SEX TRAFFICKING WITH. SEX CASES INVOLVING HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS ON OUR STATE THERE'S BEEN WONDERFUL NEW LAWS ON EDUCATION AND TRAINING GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE FOR VICTIMS. BUT THAT'S ONLY PART OF THE SIX THE SOLUTION AND IF WE DON'T. START TAKING A LOOK AT HOW WE CAN IT KEEP THE ACTUAL TRAFFICKERS TO DO THEIR TIME THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY SENTENCED TO. THIS CYCLE OF VIOLENCE WILL CONTINUE WITH THESE TRAFFICKERS BECAUSE THESE VICTIMS ARE NOT HAVING TIME TO. GET LIFE SKILLS THEY'RE NOT HAVING THEIR STILL BEING CONTROLLED BY THE TRAFFICKERS IN PRINT IN PRISON IN JAIL WHERE THEY ARE EVERY CASE THAT I SEE THAT IS WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE REACHING OUT. SO THESE VICTIMS DO NOT HAVE FAITH IN OUR SYSTEM THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO COOPERATE AT INITIALLY. SOME NOT ALL THEY'RE HAVING VERY DIFFICULT TIMES BELIEVING IN THE FAITH THAT THIS PERSON IS REALLY GOING TO BE LIKE THAT LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. IF A PERSON WHO IS CONVICTED OF SEX TRAFFICKING IS SENTENCED TO EIGHT YEARS IN STATE PRISON. THERE OUT IN FOUR YEARS. VICTIMS NO THAT'S THE MARCY'S LAUNCHERS THAT ALL VICTIMS ARE TOLD AND GIVEN THIS INFORMATION UPON. A DISPOSITION OR A GUILTY CONVICTION. NOW YOU TAKE THAT SAME PERSON AND NOW YOU HAVE THREE VICTIMS FOR FIVE IT DOESN'T MATTER. IF IF THREE VICTIM CASE. THAT TAKEN THAT'S BLOW TERM OF EIGHT YEARS AND YOU ADD THOSE OTHER TWO VICTIMS ON THAT BE ABOUT SEVENTEEN YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS. THAT TRAFFICKER IS STILL ELIGIBLE FOR. RELEASE AFTER FOUR YEARS AND THESE ARE THE FACTS THAT WE HAVE TO TELL. VICTIMS AND TRYINGTO CONVINCE THEM TO COOPERATE WITH POLICE IT'S VERY DAUNTING SITUATION AND THEY ARE CONSTANTLY IN FEAR FOR THEIR LIVES AND THEIR SAFETY AND NOT WANTING TO COME FORWARD. IF THIS IS A VIOLENT FELONY THAT CHANGES THAT IT MAKES THEM BE ABLE TO. EIGHTY PERCENT OF THEIR SENTENCE AND SET A FIFTY PERCENT ANOTHER KEY VALUABLE POINT THAT MAKING THIS A VIOLENT FELONY CHANGES. AS. AS A GENERAL RULE PROSECUTORS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY IF THEY'RE UNABLE TO PROCEED AT THE END OF. WHEN IT'S TIME TO GO TO TRIAL WITHIN STATUTORY TIMELINES ON A FELONY. THEY GET TWO CHANCES THEY CAN I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REFILE UNDER CURRENT LAW. A VIOLENT FELONY HOWEVER YOU HAVE A THIRD CHANCE. AS A PROSECUTOR IF THEY'RE UNABLE TO PROCEED THESE. HOW MANY HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASES SPECIALLY INVOLVING SEX TRAFFICKED VICTIMS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND ARE VICTIMS THEY'RE FROM OUT NAY OF THEM ARE HOMELESS THEY'RE HAVING IN SHELTERS? TAKES A LOT OF TIME MANY MANY CONVERSATIONS TO GAIN THE TRUST OF THAT THEY SHARE WITH US THAT THEY TELL US WHAT'S HAPPENING. AND THESE TIME CONSTRAINTS WHICH ARE GOOD TIME RESTRAINTS FOR STATUTORY REASONS FOR TO PROTECT THOSE THAT ARE ACCUSED BUT TO ALLOW US THAT THIRD CHANCE FOR MAKING THIS A VIOLENT FELONY WOULD BE VERY CRITICAL. IN THE OVERALL SOLUTION TO HOW TO COMBAT THIS PROBLEM THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. YOU. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME IN MY CURRENT PRESENTS THE POSITION RIGHT NOW AS A HUMAN TRAFFICKING OUTREACH COORDINATOR I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT TRAFFICKING VICTIMS AS WELL AS SUPPORT THEM ONE ON ONE. TO THEIR JOURNEY AND IN THIS TIME I HAVE HEARD MANY STORIES ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE ABOUT THE THE VIOLENCE THAT THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED A. I'M ABOUT THE TRAUMA ABOUT THE FEARS THAT THEY HAVE THE BARRIERS THAT THEY HAVE. AND A THESE BARRIERS THAT THEY BRING UP THEY DO OFTEN INCLUDE OR THEY COME UP WHEN WE ARE TALKING TO THEM ABOUT MOVING FORWARD WITH PROSECUTION WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH THIS DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN ORDER. TO HAVE A SOLID CASE SO THAT THEY CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PROSECUTION AND ENSURE THAT THEIR TRAFFICKER IS PUT INTO. A PRISON AND THAT TIME IS SERVED AND THERE ARE MANY BARRIERS AND TOO MANY TO STATE FOR TIME. CONSTRAINTS TODAY BUT ONE THAT COMES UP TIME AND TIME AGAIN THAT WAS JUST STATE IT IS TIME THE TIME THAT THIS PROCESS TAKES. AS WELL AS THE TIME OF THE SENTENCING THAT WHEN EVERYTHING IS SAID AND DONE SO TODAY I SPEAK IN HOPES TO. HELP CONTINUE WITH THE CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE MADE NOT ONLY TO HOLD THE PERPETRATORS FULLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR CRIMES BUT EVEN MORE SO SO THAT WE AS SOCIETY STAND BEHIND OUR WORDS. AND REALLY PUT LAWS IN ACTIONS BEHIND WHAT WE ARE SAYING I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT NOW THAT WE'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY AS A COMMUNITY AS A SOCIETY TO HEAR FROM TRAFFICKING VICTIMS AND HEAR THEIR EXPERIENCES. IT'S FAIR AND JUST TO SAY THAT IT IS A CRIME OF VIOLENCE THEY EXPERIENCE A LOT OF VIOLENCE AGAINST THEMSELVES. AND SO IT'S FAIR JUST TO SAY THAT WE NEED TO CALL IT WHAT IT IS WHEN WE START CALLING A CRIME AND PUTTING THAT TITLE TO IT THAT IT DESERVES. I BELIEVE THAT'S WHEN CHANGE CAN BE MADE SO I FIRST JUST SAYING WHAT IT IS AND THAT WILL SPEAK VOLUMES HE'LL SPEAK VOLUMES TO ALL PARTIES INVOLVED THE TRAFFICKER AS WELL AS THE VICTIM. IT HELPS TO CONFIRM TO THEM YES WE SEE THAT YOU'R A VICTIM THIS IS UNFAIR AND WE ARE GOING TO SUPPORT YOU. I RECENTLY SUPPORTED A CLIENT THROUGH THE COURT PROCESS OF PROSECUTION OF HER TRAFFICKER AND BY ALL PARTIES INVOLVED SHE WAS VERY A COOPERATIVE SHE WANTED TO WORK WITH THE DA SHE WANTED TO WORK WITH THE LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO MAKE SURE THAT HER TRAFFICKER WAS PUT INTO JAIL. AND FROM THE VERY BEGINNING EVEN THOUGH SHE HAD TO DEAL WITH HER OWN TRAUMA IN TRYING TO GT SAFE AND THINK ABOUT HER OWN SAFETY NOT ONLY IN THE MOMENT THAT HER WELL BEING A LONG TERM MOVING FORWARD BUILDING THE LIFE THAT SHE DESERVED. FROM THE MOMENT THAT HE WAS ARRESTED EVEN AFTER HE WAS SENTENCED AND TRANSFERRED TO WHERE HE WAS GOING TO BE SPENDING HIS TIME HE CONTINUE TO REACH OUT TO HER TO THREATEN TO HURT TO THREATEN HER FAMILY MEMBERS. TO CONTACT HER ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND SO ALL THAT THAT DID WAS NOT ONLY CONFIRMED HER THE FEARS THAT SHE HAD WERE ALIVE AND VALID BUT IT ALSO CHANGED HER TIMELINE SHE KNEW. THAT HE WAS IN CONTROL STILL EVEN THOUGH HE WAS LOCKED UP AND NOT VERY SOON BECAUSE THE PLEA THAT HE DID ACCEPT THAT HE WOULD BE GETTING THAT HE WOULD BE GETTING OUT. SO I THINK THAT IF AS A COMMUNITY WE THINK IT'S HARD TO HEAR THE STORIES AND IT'S CHALLENGING TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS. TO TRY TO HELP THESE VICTIMS THAT WE CAN TAKE A MINUTE JUST TO THINK HOW MUCH HARDER IS THAT FOR THE VICTIMS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THESE STORIES AND THESE EXPERIENCES TO MOVE FORWARD AND THAT IF WHAT WE CAN GIVE THEM. IS MORE TIME THAN I THINK THAT IS VERY FAIR. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. TIFFANY MATTHEWS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IT'S PART. OKAY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING CATHY SHARPER FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB TWENTY THREE FIFTY SIX. BY ADDING NEWMAN SEX TRAFFICKING TO THE LIST OF VIOLENT FELONIES AB TWENTY THREE FIFTY SIX WOULD PERPETUATE CALIFORNIA'S EXPENSIVE AND INEFFECTIVE OVER RELIANCE ON INCARCERATION. IN DIRECT CONTRADICTION TO WHAT THE VOTERS INTENDED WHEN THEY VOTED FOR PROP FIFTY SEVEN. AB TWENTY THREE FIFTY SIX ALSO SINGLES OUT HUMAN TRAFFICKING. A CRIME FOR WHICH INCREASED PENALTIES UP TO FIFTEEN TO LIFE HAVE JUST RECENTLY GONE INTO EFFECT. AND IT WOULD MAKE SEX TRAFFICKING A STRIKE EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF THAT LAW TO FURTHER SET BACK THE CLOCK AND KEEP MORE PEOPLE BEHIND BARS FOR FAR LONGER. THIS IS NOT A BILL THAT FIXES A MISTAKE THE OPPONENTS OF PROP FIFTY SEVEN EXPRESSLY POINTED TO HUMAN SEX TRAFFICKING AMONG OTHER CRIMES. IN ARGUING AGAINST THE PROPOSITION. THE VOTERS DIDN'T BUY IT BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT THE CHOICE THEY WERE MAKING WAS WHAT WAS NEEDED TO MOVE THE NEEDLE ON PRISON COSTS. THERE ARE WAYS TO COMBAT HUMAN SEX TRAFFICKING WE DON'T DO NOT BELIEVE THAT INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF TIME SERVED FOR IT. AS WOULD HAPPEN UNDER THIS BILL IS THE WAY TO DO THAT. REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PRISONERS AND THE COST OF INCARCERATING THEM IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IF CRIME BY CRIME THE LEGISLATURE RECLASSIFIED OFFENSES SO AS TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF TIME OFFENDERS MUST SIR. WE ARCHER NO VOTE ON AB TWENTY THREE FIFTY SIX. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OKAY COME MITCHELL COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THE COURT YES I AM I JUST DON'T BELIEVE IN THREE STRIKES PERIOD. SO I WILL BE VOTING FOR YOUR BILL. KEN. EXCUSE ME THERE'S ONE MORE WITNESS THAT WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT CALLING YOU. SO SORRY IT ROSA CABRERA BEHALF OF THE ALLIANCE WAS MEN OF COLOR IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. KILLING PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. AND THANK YOU TO AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL TO OUR ATTENTION AS WELL AS THE WITNESSES TODAY. I THINK FOR A LOT OF THOSE THREE STRIKES ARE PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN HOWELL. IT'S IMPACTED PRIMARILY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. BLACK MEN LATINO MEN ARE. INCARCERATED AT DIFFERENT RATES ACROSS OUR STATE AND ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. HOWEVER IT IT BOTHERS ME THAT CRIMES THAT ARE COMMITTED AGAINST WOMEN WHICH ARE WOMEN ARE PREDOMINANTLY THE THE VICTIMS OF SEX TRAFFICKING. ARE NOT SEEN AS VIOLENT. AND THE FACT THAT. THESE CRIMES ARE COMMITTED OVER AND OVER AND OVER TO A PERSON'S BODY. I THINK SAYS A LOT ABOUT. HOW WE MANAGE OUR OUR LEGISLATION IN TERMS OF WHAT WE CONSIDER TO BE VIOLENT CRIMES? AND FOR HOPE. TO. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY ULTIMATELY WHILE. SEX TRAFFICKING OCCURS TO MOSTLY WOMEN. IT ALSO OCCURS TO MEN. AND THE BEAT GOES BEYOND GENDER. AND IT GOES BEYOND AGE SINCE WE KNOW A LOT OF VICTIMS ARE UNDER AGE AS WELL. SO WHILE I DO HAVE SOME RESERVATIONS IN TERMS OF WHAT THIS MEANS I THINK. I WILL BE VOTING YES BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT CRIMES COMMITTED AGAINST WOMEN PREDOMINANTLY ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO VIOLENCE SEX. I. THE TRAFFICKING SO VERY SERIOUS ISSUE FOR OUR STATE. AND I WILL CONTINUE TO BE A SERIOUS ISSUE ACROSS OUR COUNTRY ANNA'S. JUST ON A SIDE NOTE I THINK SOMETHING THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN ALLEN LOS ANGELES SPECIFICALLY. IS WHEN THE OLYMPICS COME. WHAT WILL BE THE? THE UNDERLYING AND. UNDERGROUND ECONOMY OF SEX TRAFFICKING AS WELL WHICH WE KNOW IS IS A BIG ISSUE IN LOS ANGELES I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS TO OUR ATTENTION. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. SUMMARY MIKLOS. I THINK THAT WHAT THIS IS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THEIR THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR KNIFE AT. OKAY WE NEED A SECOND. OKAY. OF THE QUESTION. AB TWENTY THREE FIFTY SIX THE MOTION IS TO PASSED THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. LACKEY AYE AYE LACKEY I CARILLO. CARILLO AYE CONCISELY JR. GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE KILEY. KILEY AYE QUIRK NO QUIRK KNOW SANTIAGO SANTIAGO AYE. MEASURE PASSES. SO MEMBER TING. MAYBE TWENTY OR THIRTY EIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. A. AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY A. STRIVES TO STREAMLINE OUR CURRENT EXPUNGEMENT PROCESS. THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS. WE KNOW THAT. PEOPLE WHO HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME BY SERVE PROBATION. HAVE CRIMINAL RECORDS THERE THEY HAVE A TEN PERCENT INCREASE IN EMPLOYMENT RATE ONCE. OUR RECORDS HAVE BEEN EXPUNGED ARE CURRENTLY ARE EXPLAINED REPRISE THIS IS. THE ARE RATHER ONEROUS IT'S A LITTLE BIT COMPLICATED. AND WE HAVEA BACKLOG WHAT WE HOPE TO DO IS TO STREAMLINE THIS PROCESS MOVING FORWARD WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE CONCERNS. REGARDING THE FISCAL COST FOR GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO NINETEEN SEVENTY. SO WE WILL BE REMOVING THAT ARE RETROACTIVE NATURE OF FROM THE LEGISLATION. IN JUST MOVING AHEAD AND LOOKING AT THIS PRO ACTIVELY. WE ALSO ARE VERY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO ADDRESS THEIR PARTICULAR CONCERNS. ABOUT WHETHER SHE SHOULD COUNSEL PROBATION OR THE TRIBUTARIES WITH THE CONTINUING. TO OUR WORK WITH THEM AS WE MOVE FORWARD. COME. AS YOU ALL KNOW IN THIS COMMITTEE THAT WE SPEND ABOUT ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN OUR CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. BUDGET. ONE OF THE BIG HURDLES FOR AND THE BIG EXPENSES ARE THEIR CAN THE REAP REPEAT OFFENDER SO WHERE THE MAIN REASONS WE HAVE REPEAL. PEOPLE CANNOT GET EMPLOYMENT I. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROCESS PROGRESS OVER THE LAST NUMBER YEARS. TO. HELP PEOPLE ONCE THEY'VE. SERVE THEIR CRIME AND SERVE THEIR TIME. REALLY HAVE THOSE RECORDS CLEAR. AND THIS REALLY IS THAT PROCESS MOVING FORWARD ON. THE RECORDS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT PURPOSES WILL REMAIN SO IF YOU ARE AT PEACE OFFICER YOU'RE A JUDGE YOU'RE A PROBATION OFFICER JUST PRETENDING YOU WILL CONTINUE DEAL TO SEE. THOSE RECORDS IN YOUR DATABASE THIS IS. A BUT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT TRYING TO HELP THOSE INDIVIDUALS GET EMPLOYMENT ONCE THEY HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME. NOT WITHOUT A HAPPY TO HAVE TWO WITNESSES. ANDRE PERRY FROM CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE AND. HE ONLY SEES HERNANDEZ FROM THE DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE. HI GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MISTER TANG IN YOUR CENTER FOR WORKING WITH US ON THE SPELLING THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AS WELL. AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER HAS ALREADY STATED MOVING FORWARD WE ARE. REMOVING. THE RETROACTIVE PEACE AND MAKING SURE THAT THIS BILL WILL START FROM. THE DAY AT ITS SIDE MOVING FORWARD. AS WE KNOW THE ISSUE AND COULD BEING CONSIDERED TODAY IS NOT ONLY A CONSEQUENTIAL STEP TOWARDS OUR COLLECTIVE GOAL OF ENSURING. THAT COMMUNITIES THRIVE BUT IT'S ALSO FUNDAMENTAL TO ERADICATE THE BARRIERS TO ENTRY ONCE AN INDIVIDUAL HAS PERFORMED AT PERFORM THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY I WILL AND CUT MY TIME SHORT IN ORDER TO GIVE OUR TIME FOR. HI GOOD MORNING. HONORABLE JONES SAWYER IS NOT HERE AND ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS ONLY SAYS THAT NONE THIS. CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLICY COORDINATOR WITH THE DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE IN LOCAL AND NATIONAL ORGANIZATION ADVOCATING FOR DRUG POLICIES CREDITED SCIENCE HEALTH. AND HUMAN RIGHTS THE REAL OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY EIGHT. IN THE LAST THREE YEARS I'VE ORGANIZED AND EXECUTED OVER FOUR DOZEN EXPUNGEMENT FAIRS AND HVE HELPED THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS OBTAIN EXPUNGEMENT. AND OTHER FORMS OF POST CONVICTION RELIEF THE CURRENT EXPOSURE PROCESS IN CALIFORNIA IS DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE EXPENSIVE TIME CONSUMING AND ARDUOUS IT REQUIRES A PETITIONER TO BE FAMILIAR WITH DOZENS OF LEGAL FORMS. OF FEE WAIVERS AND CORE PROCESS HE'S MAKING IT ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT IF THEY HAVE MULTIPLE CONVICTIONS IN VARIOUS COUNTIES AND IN VARIOUS COURT HOUSES. EACH EXPUNGEMENT. ALSO NEEDS TO BE SUBMITTED AT THE COURTHOUSE THEY WERE CONVICTED SO THAT'S ALSO VERY TROUBLESOME. IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE THE X. BUT REPETITION IS EIGHT PAGES LONG YOU NEED TO MAKE FIVE COPIES AND SUBMITTED TO FIVE DIFFERENT AGENCIES. AND LA COUNTY THE EXPOSURE PETITION CAN BE UP TO TWELVE PAGES LONG WITH EACH COURTHOUSE REQUIRING DIFFERENT FORMS AND WAIVERS. ANYTHING CAN LEAD TO A REJECTION EVEN NOT HOLE PUNCHING THE DOCUMENTS CORRECTLY. THERE'S A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS FILING FEE FOR EVERY EXPERT REPETITION FILED THIS YOU CAN STACK UP IF YOU HAVE MULTIPLE CONVICTIONS CAUSING BARRIERS FOR PEOPLE WHO. ARE LOW INCOME OR CAN'T GET JOBS OR EVEN IN SOME COUNTIES WHERE THE FEE CANNOT BE WAIVED. IN SHORT THERE IS NO UNIFORM SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA THAT CAN BE EASILY OR SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATED BY REGULAR PERSON EVEN SOMEONE LIKE MYSELF WAS YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN THIS. THERE ARE FOUR THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED STICK RESTRICTIONS THAT. EXIST FOR SOMEONE HAS A CRIMINAL RECORD OF THESE RESTRICTIONS FIFTY PERCENT ARE EMPLOYMENT RELATED AND SEVENTY THREE PERCENT ARE PERMITTED BANDS. A MANY OF THESE RESTRICTIONS ARE REMOVED AND THE INDIVIDUAL GETS ON X. OF THE CONVICTION EXPUNGED AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY EIGHT ALLOWS FOR MORE CALIFORNIANS TO OBTAIN RELIEF. OPENING THE DOORS ARE TO HOUSING EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. I KNOW COMMUNITY WINS WHEN THERE ARE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO CAN'T GET A JOB OR HOUSING. ONCE AGAIN I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY EIGHT A BILL THAT WILL HELP OUR COMMITTEE'S DRIVE BY REMOVING THE BARRIERS TO RE ENTRY. THANK YOU AND. HONORABLE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME'S JAIL AMERICAN I'M WITH THE EAST BAY TWENTY LAW CENTER AS MY COLLEAGUES HERE ALREADY STATED THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR A LOT OF REASONS EMPLOYMENT. IT'S CRITICAL ON THE GROUND AND ALAMEDA COUNTY. WHERE I WORK BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT FOLKS THERE'S SUCH A BACKLOG THAT YOU CAN APPLY FOR AN EXPUNGEMENT IN JANUARY AND NOT ACTUALLY GET A COURT DATE UNTIL SEPTEMBER? KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS IS IF YOU HAVE EMPLOYMENT ISSUES IF YOU HAVE IMMIGRATION ISSUES IF YOU HAVE HOUSING ISSUES THAT COME UP IN THE EANTIME. THEN YOU'RE JUST YOU JUST LOSE OUT. AND THAT'S WHAT FOLKS ARE FACING AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID IN OTHER COUNTIES IT'S EVEN WORSE IN OTHER COUNTIES THERE MAY BE A SITUATION THERE'S NOT ORGANIZATION LIKE DB CLC AND YOU HAVE TO FIGURE THIS OUT ON YOUR OWN YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT ALL THIS LEGAL LANGUAGE. ON YOUR OWN SO I THINK. I THINK ASSEMBLY RETAINING FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS I THINK AND I REALLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. HI. MY NAME IS THE INHERENT I'M REPRESENTING A CHECKER A CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY IN NATIONALLY CREDIT BACKGROUND SKINNER. I'M HERE TODAY. REPRESENTING CHECKER. BECAUSE THIS BILL IS UP MORE THAN ABOUT THE AYE EXPUNGEMENT BUT. MORE SO ABOUT EMPLOYMENT SO. CHECKER DO YOU SOME CONTEXT HAS RUN ABOUT SIXTEEN MILLION BACKGROUND CHECKS IN LAS FOR YEARS. TWENTY BACKGROUND CHECKS. WHAT COMES OUT OF THAT IS NOT CHEST UP PUBLIC RECORD BUT ALSO THE DECISIONS THAT EMPLOYERS MAKE SO I'M HAVING A CRIMINAL RECORD? JUST IN GENERAL CUTS APPLICANTS JOB CHANCES BATES CLEAN HOUSE BY FIFTY PERCENT. BY. EXPANDING DOT THE KIND A PATHWAY TO GET EXPUNGEMENT. WERE SEEING NOW PLAYERS HOP ON. THE WAGON HERE TO ACTUALLY LOOK FOR MORE LEGISLATION BECAUSE THEY'RE LOOKING FOR WORKERS IT SAT A TIGHT JOB MARKET RIGHT NOW AND. COMPANIES ARE GROWING IT'S A GOOD TIME FOR THE ECONOMY SO YOUR TRADITIONAL KIND OF AB KIM PULLS. ARE NOT AVAILABLE LIKE THEY WERE A FEW YEARS AGO SO. WERE LOOKING FOR. EMPLOYERS LOOKING FOR MORE PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY COME TO THE TABLE AND ARE LOOKING TO GIVE FAIR CHANCES BUT. BEING AFFAIR. BEING A BACKGROUND SCREENER WE ARE ARE REGULATED BY THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT. IN WITH THAT WE HAVE A. RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE ACCURACY. THAT INCLUDES EXPUNGEMENT AND THE ACTUAL. ACCURACY OF SOMEBODY'S EXPUNGEMENT STATUS SO. IF SOMEBODY HOUSING EXPUNGEMENT REPORTING AGENCIES LIKE OURSELVES. WHICH ALL EMPLOYERS ARE USING FOR BACKGROUND CHECKS WILL NOT REPORT THAT KIND OF INFORMATION THAT'S GIVING PEOPLE. A BETTER HEADWAY FOR A JOB BACKGROUND CHECKS IN ESSENCE ARE BARRIERS FOR PEOPLE CRIMINAL RECORDS. SO BY. HAVING BETTER PATHWAYS TO EXPUNGEMENT WE ARE AYE GIVING PEOPLE MORE. AVAILABILITY TO EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY. ORDERS COMMITTED VOTES. AYE ON THIS THANK YOU. GIVE TAKE YOU A OTHER WITNESSES AND SPORT. KATHY SHARE FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. DRESS LIKE OUT IT UP WITH THE ALLIANCE WAS MEN OF COLOR SUPPORT. ERIC ANDERSON WITH ELLA BAKER CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS SUPPORT. CALIFORNIA CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCACY IN MANY HYATT IN SUPPORT. AND I CHAU CRIMES REYES FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE IN SUPPORT. TO ANYONE WITH A SENIOR UN SUPPORT. OKAY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION GOOD MORNING MEMBERS AND COMMITTEE I MY NAME IS DANIEL SANCHEZ ON BEHALF OF THE ARCHIE PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA FIRST I WANT TO THANK. ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAM IN AND HIS OFFICE ON AND THE SPONSORS FOR WORKING VERY VERY CLOSELY WITH. SEE PARK ON THIS ISSUE WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS. ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WE I'M CERTAINLY SHARE THE INTENSE WE ARE STRONG PROPONENTS OF REMOVING BARRIERS I'M TO RE ENTRY TO. YOU KNOW WANTING TO FACILITATE HOUSING EMPLOYMENT ALL OF THOSE SERVICES SO I THINK WE COME FROM A. AYE AYE SHARED MISSION ON IN THAT REGARD. FOR APPROPRIATION AS WE LOOK AT THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL RIGHT NOW WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE REMOVAL OF THE RETROACTIVITY PIECE. ON THAT THAT ADDED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT I THINK. FROM THE WORKLOAD PERSPECTIVE OPERATION CURRENTLY HAS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. PERSONS UNDER OUR SUPERVISION AND SO WE AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE AUTO EXPUNGEMENT. FOR THAT POPULATION THERE'S MANY QUESTIONS THAT ARISE ABOUT. WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT IN THAT CASE WHERE SOMEBODY WHICH WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO SEE BUT WERE SOME HE DOES COME BACK INTO THE SYSTEM? HOW MANY TIMES ARE THEY ELIGIBLE FOR ON THIS RELIEF WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE WE WE OBVIOUSLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH THE COURT'S PERMISSION IN THE ENTIRE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION WE NEED TO BEST SERVE THEM? WHEN THEY COME BACK IF THEY DO COME BACK INTO THE SYSTEM. SO THERE CERTAINLY FISCAL COSTS I THINK. FOR PERMISSION WE STILL BELIEVE THERE'S A. A VERY STRONG NEED FOR THE COURT TO HAVE A ROLE IN THIS. IN THIS PROCESS AND IN LOOKING AT THESE PETITIONS SO I'M WERE CERTAINLY COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TIFFANY MATTHEWS ON HALF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AND WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY EIGHT. EXISTING LAW PRESENTLY HOW THE PROCESS BY WHICH A PERSON CAN WITH MINIMAL EFFORT OBTAIN THIS RELIEF. AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY EIGHT ELIMINATES OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PROSECUTING AGENCY TO CHALLENGE THE RELIEF. IF THEY BELIEVE THE PERSON DOES NOT QUALIFY BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF ANOTHER OFFENSE OR FACING CURRENT CHARGES. ALL OF THESE CHANGES RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS AND WORKLOAD FOR A TRIAL COURT'S LIKELY AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR CURRENT TASKS IN OBLIGATIONS. WHICH TEND TO BE MORE PUBLIC SAFETY RELATED RATHER THAN CLEANING UP OLD RECORDS. WE BELIEVE THE EXISTING PROCESS OFFICIALLY BALANCES A PERSON'S OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK RELIEF. BUT THE PROSECUTION'S RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT ONLY QUALIFYING OFFENDERS ARE ABLE TO BENEFIT. WE'RE ABLE TO DO THIS WITHIN EXISTING RESOURCES AND SEE NO REASON WHY THE PROCESS NEEDS TO BE CHANGED. SHARON RILEY. ON BEHALF OF JUDICIAL COUNCIL VERY BRIEFLY WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE BILL WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S. AMENDMENTS. HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME PRACTICAL. CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THE COURTS WILL GET ACCESS TO INFORMATION. IN ORDER TO VERIFY THAT THE INDIVIDUAL IS ELIGIBLE FOR EXPUNGEMENT AND FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS. WOULD BE DETERMINING WHETHER AN INDIVIDUAL HUSTLER LIVED IN HONEST AND UPRIGHT LIFE. AND ALSO I'M COURTS DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE. THE RAP SHEETS AND THEY WOULD ORDINARILY GET THAT INFORMATION FROM THE PROBATION DEPARTMENTS SO AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO LOOKING AT WORKING WITH AUTHOR AND THE SPONSOR IN THE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. ON ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WORLD. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. IN. SEEING NONE ARE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MISTER KILEY. BAG MORNING THAT MISTER TING AND SO I THINK THERE'S A. A LOT BEHIND THIS THAT I I CAN. SUPPORT IN PRINCIPLE AND I I WILL NOTE THE SORT OF DIE IN INCONGRUITY THAT. THIS BILL WILL NOT A FACT I THE QUALIFICATION OF SOMEONE. WHO HAS A CONVICTION FOR AN OCCUPATIONAL LICENSE THAT IS? THAT IS. GIVEN BY. BY STATE THE STATE OR STATE AGENCIES. AND IN FACT US SUCH PEOPLE WILL STILL NOT BE AYE QUALIFIED EVEN GET A LICENSE IN MANY CASES. SO I THINK THERE'S SOME. INCONGRUITY. IN THAT THE VERY THING THE IDEA THAT IS A CRIMINAL CONVICTION. THAT DISQUALIFIES YOU. FROM BEING LICENSED BY THE STATE I'M THIS BILL IS KIND OF DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO AYE CONCEAL FROM EVEN BEING A FACTOR IN THE DECISION A PRIVATE EMPLOYERS AND SO. I'M ACTUALLY AYE TAKING ON. MEASURE TO. ADDRESS THE FIRST PART AND I INVITE YOU TO WORK WITH ME ON THAT AND WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU AS A CO AUTHOR OF. AND THAT YOU KNOW I IF IT'S TRUE THAT IT'S TAKING A LONG TIME FOR PEOPLE TO GET THE SORT OF RELIEF THE BACKLOG OF ONE OF THE WITNESSES. I'VE TALKED ABOUT. I THINK THAT'S BAD AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT. AND I COULD CERTAINLY. YOU KNOW. THE MAGIC SUPPORTING THE MORE STREAMLINED PROCEDURE BUT I THIS IS FOR THE REASONS THAT BEEN CITED HERE IN OPPOSITION SIMPLY I MAKING THE SOMETHING AUTOMATIC I DON'T THINK IS IS IN THE INTERESTS OF OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT. I THINK IS REALLY WORKABLE. BUT I APPRECIATE THAT INTENDS BEHIND IT. ANY OTHER. YES. CARILLO THANK YOU THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION BOTH AND SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION. I JUST A QUESTION ON THE AND THE REMOVAL OF THE AUTOMATIC EXPUNGEMENT. SO DOES THAT MEAN THAT. FOLKS THAT WERE ON PROBATION AFTER NINETEEN SEVENTY WILL STILL BE ABLE TO APPLY. YES DAHLE WILL GO THROUGH THAT APPLICATION PROCESS. WE JEWS WOULDN'T ALLOW THEM THE AUTO EXPUNGEMENT PROCESS AND PART OF THAT IS. BASED ON OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH PROBATION JUDICIAL COUNCIL DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S ON THEY FOUND THAT PROCESS RATHER ONEROUS AND THE WORKLOAD FAIRLY FAIRLY SIZEABLE SO. WE REALLY FELT THAT HOME BASED ON BASED ON THAT SITUATION WE WANTED TO DO IT MOVING FOR START AGAIN JANUARY FIRST WHEN THE BILL WOULD BECOME ACTIVE OKAY THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION. YES MISS GONZALEZ FLETCHER. IRONMAN. STILL NOT SURE. I I THINK THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT I MEAN I I WAS OUT A NO I UNDERSTAND THERE WERE NEGOTIATIONS THE RECOMMENDATION WILL NOW BE A YES. I'M CONCERNED BUT I DON'T KNOW I I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN A FAX HAVE ASK FOR. SPECIFICALLY A LIST OF. OF THE THE CRIMES THAT ARE AUTOMATICALLY EXPUNGED. I. THAT ALWAYS CONCERNS ME BECAUSE I HAVE VOTED IN THIS COMMITTEE BEFORE ON THINGS AND THEN LATER FOUND OUT ON THE WERE CERTAIN CRIMES ON THEIR THAT. I WOULDN'T BE COMFORTABLE WITH AN AUTOMATIC EXPUNGEMENT FOR. IN SO I'M NOT SURE WHEN OR HOW I CAN GET THAT LIST. I A I A. INSISTS THAT ON THE ONE HAND FROM ESPECIALLY APPROPRIATIONS STANDPOINT WHICH ARE NOT CONSIDERING HERE THE THE REMOVAL OF THE NINETEEN SEVENTY. KIND OF ARBITRARY DATE IS A POSITIVE ONE BUT ON THE OTHER HAND. I THINK ABOUT KIND OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND HOW FAR WE'VE COME AND. HOW MUCH MORE FAIR IT IS TODAY THAN IT HAD BEEN ESPECIALLY THROUGH THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND SO I'M CONCERNED THAT I MIGHT HAVE IT CREATING KIND OF A TWO CLASS SOCIETY THAT ARE? EXASPERATING WHAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM A A TWO CLASS SOCIETY JUST LOOK AT THE WAY WE DEAL WITH DRUGS TODAY COMPARED TO. YOU KNOW THE CRACK EPIDEMIC IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND NINETIES. SO. I'M CA AYE AYE. FROM A FISCAL STANDPOINT APPRECIATE THIS CHANGE BUT FROM A. A EQUITABLE FAIRNESS STANDPOINT THINK THAT THEY'RE AT THAT. I CONCERNED. I'M. OF THOSE ANSWERS. ANSWERED I THINK I'M GONNA HAVE TO LAY OFF TODAY I'M REALLY PSYCHED THAT WANT TO GET THERE I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS WRITE MY THING YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY HAVE DONE A LOT OF WORK IN POST CONVICTION RELIEF IN ALL OF THESE THINGS. IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME AND YET I JUST HAVE TOO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS AND I DON'T WANT TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE. WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS IN APPROPRIATIONS AND I'M MAKING POLICY DECISIONS. AND THEN WE'RE COMING BACK HERE BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN THE PAST AND SO. WE WILL I I JUST WANNA GET IT RIGHT AND SO I'M THE LAYOFF OF AT THIS TIME I'D LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU IN YOUR OFFICE AND. I'M GETTING TO A POINT OF FEELING MORE COMFORTABLE ABOUT THIS BILL BEFORE I CAN SUPPORT IT I'M AND I HOPE THAT IT MOVES FORWARD I JUST CAN'T SUPPORT IT TODAY. RICK IN IT COULD DISMISS AYE TORT CROSS WHAT QUICK ISSUE SO I'M HAPPY TO GET TO THE I THINK WE DO HAVE A LIST. MY STAFF CAN. PROVIDE THAT SO JUST JUST TO CLARIFY THIS BILL DOES NOT EXPAND OR CONTRACT THE CURRENT THE CURRENT. CRIMES THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR EXPUNGEMENT IT JUST STREAMLINED THAT PROCESS. SURE BUT IT MAKES AN AUTOMATIC CORCORAN WHICH. LEAVES JUDGMENT OUT CRACKED. WHOA WHOA. THANK YOU POLITE. LET I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS NOW YEAH THANK YOU TEAR COMMITTEE MEMBERS SO SO THE BASE IS BEHIND THIS A LEGISLATION IS ARM TO WHAT THREE POINT FOUR WHICH IS EXPUNGEMENT RIGHT IT'S. REMOVAL OF PLEA. IT SAYS STATES IN STATUE THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE MANDATED EXPUNGEMENT BUT THIS BILL IT WILL NOT TAKE. I'M DISCRETION AWAY FROM THE DATE THE DETERMINES OFFICE ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT TO STOP EXPUNGEMENT. THEY'VE THEY WITH TWO OF THE THIRTY DAYS TO STOP NEXT MONTH IF THEY WANT TO DO IT EXPEDITED PROCESS AND TAKES THE ONUS. OFF OF THE INDIVIDUAL WHO WERE POURING CANNOT YOU KNOW. GO TO TRAVEL TO FOUR DIFFERENT COUNTIES IT JUST SAYS HEY PROBATION WILL AUTUMN WALL EXPEDITE THE PROCESS RIGHTS WOULDN'T CHANGE ANY ANY CURRENT LAW IT'S IT'S LITERALLY PUTS THE ONUS ON PROBATION WHICH WHEN THEY TERMINATE PRO PROBATION. THEY WERE RECOMMENDING EXPUNGEMENT IT'S PARTY IN STATUTE ALREADY IT SAYS YOU KNOW THAT. PROBATIONER. SALE GET THE RECORD EXPUNGED. THROUGH A TO BECOME THE PROCESS LIKE TUCKER. TESTIFIED EARLIER AND EBSCO SEE IN DPA AND ALL OF OF TO OPPOSE EXPERT RELIEF REALIZE THAT PEOPLE ONE EXPUNGEMENT BUT IT JUST SOUL SO HARD SO IF IN STATUTE THERE ALREADY MANDATE THE GIVEN EXPUNGEMENT WHY NOT HAVE THAT PROCESS EXPEDITED. THROUGH. THROUGH. THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT WHICH WHICH WHICH. WHICH IS MANDATED BY STATUTE ALREADY AND DO NOT TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM THE DA'S OR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO STOP EXPUNGEMENT. THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL ACTUALLY APPRECIATE THAT I'M. THERE IS ONE THING THAT CONCERNED ME IT RELIEVES A LOT OF MY CONCERNS ON A POLICY STANDPOINT. THAT IN ACTUALLY I'M. GETS ME CLOSER THERE THINK CONCERNED PACEY SAID HE PUTS THE ONEROUS ON PROBATION. WELL WORK ORGANIZA. SO IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S THE PROCESS WHICH WE'RE LOOKING AT IS A VERY IS A PROCESS IN WHICH. YOU KNOW IT'S ADMINISTRATIVE THEN IT MAKES IT A LOT EASIER AND SO ON THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATION IS TO LOOK AT A PROCESS THAT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY. RIGHT TO CHORDS THE PURSUING YOU KNOW EVERYBODY A LOT OF MONEY AND MAKE THAT PROCESS LESS MONEY. MAKE THE THE PROCESS MORE EFFICIENT AND THEN MAKE YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA WAS LIKE SO THE THIRTY DAY. CHALLENGE PORTION DOES THAT. DOES THAT. IS THAT THIRTY DAYS RIGHT AFTER A PERSON IS FINISHED PROBATION OR WHEN THEY APPLY FOR EXPUNGEMENT. WHEN I APPLY FOR ITS BUDGET. ONCE A PIE FOR EXPUNGEMENT. SO I AM SORRY I JUST HAVE NO IDEA HOW THIS WORKS AT THAT WOULD I ACTUALLY THOUGHT WAS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. SO. HOW IS THAT IS SO? WHEN YOU SAY IT'S PRIMER ONEROUS. ON PROBATION. POWELL Y.. COR FOR THE QUESTION WILL YOU SAID THIS TAKES AWAY THE OWNERS OF THE CRIMINAL. I'M I DON'T USE THE WORD CRIMINAL THAT YOU ARE THAT I WAS LIKE I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE. DEFEND AND THE PLEA YOUR LOVE. THE PERSON IN THE COURT SYSTEM AND PUTS IT. MORE PUT MORE ONEROUS ON BUT THERE'S MORE OWNERS PLAYED A PROBATION NOT ON PROBATION LIKE ON THE PROCESS SO IT ON THE PROCESS NOT ON PROBATION OFFICERS NO ADDITIONAL STEP ON THE PROCESS THERE YOU GO. I MISSPOKE YOU YOU GUYS REALLY GOT TO GET IN EXPLAINS BILLS TO ME BEFORE RECENTLY AND. AND I MEAN SERIOUSLY THIS IS A REALLY COMPLICATED AND I'M I'M I WANT TO GET THERE AND FOR SOMEBODY LIKE ME TO COME IN AND BE VERY CLEAR THAT. I DON'T THINK I'M THERE THAT LIKE HEY THAT SHOULD BE A RED FLAG THAT IT'S NOT REALLY CLEAR WHAT'S GOING ON HERE SO. AND YET IMAGINE IF YOU ARE NOT CLEAR NOW PERSON WHO DIDN'T EXPLODE WITH RELIEVING CLOUT IN JUST MATTER IF I'M NOT UNCLEAR THERE TO ME LIVE OTHER LEGISLATORS WHO PROBABLY AREN'T IN THE SAME MENTAL SPACE THAT ARE SO ALRIGHT. SO. WITH THAT I THINK ALL OF SANTIAGO WITH IT IS THAT YOU COULD CAN I FINISH I'M SORRY. TO SHARE. I WILL SUPPORT IT TODAY I'M ON THE CONDITION OF EVERYTHING YOU'RE TOLD ME IS TRUE WHAT YOU MEAN BY OPENNESS AND WHO IS RESPONSIBLE BUT I DO AGREE THAT THERE IS A SYSTEM THAT IS BACKLOGGED. THERE IS IF WE DON'T UNDERSTAND IT HERE ARE YOU KNOW ASK LEGISLATORS I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR EVERYDAY PEOPLE TRYING TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS ESPECIALLY. IF THEY ARE INVOLVED IN DIFFERENT COUNTIES THAT HAVE DIFFERENT STEPS ACROSS OUR STATE. SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT TO OUR ATTENTION. SANTIAGO DOMESTIC WORK. SURE AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR FOR HIS HARD WORK JUST MAKE IT MAYBE ECHOA COUPLE THINGS IF IF I MAY. UM. BECAUSE IT DID GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT OF HEARTBURN IN A COUPLE DIFFERENT PLACES RIGHT AND I'M. I WON'T ECHO TOO MUCH ON THE TWO TIER SYSTEM BY THINK I THINK AT SOME POINT AND NEED THAT DOES NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. AND CERTAINLY WE WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE A SECOND OPPORTUNITY. STRUGGLE LITTLE INTERNALLY WITH THE PERSON WHO WHO ON THEIR OWN. WANTS TO CHANGE THEIR LIFE AND TAKE SOME SORT OF INITIATIVE. TO CHANGE OUR LIFE AND GOES TO THE EXPUNGEMENT PROCESS AS OPPOSED TO LET'S JUST SIX BUNGE EVERYBODY EVEN THOSE WHO ARE NOT LESS FEELING SOME SORT OF CHANGE OR REMORSE OR. WANTING TO GET THEIR LIFE ARE ON TRACK EVEN THOUGH I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE INTENT IS. ALSO STRUGGLE FROM TIME TO IT HEARING THIS. KIND OF LIKE SOME ALLOWS WE PASSED IT IN THE PAST RIGHT SO IF A USED TO BE A FELONY DE TO STEAL SOMETHING. AT A CERTAIN NUMBER NINE FIFTY IN OFFICE AND IT'S A MISDEMEANOR. I WOULDN'T WANT TO YOU THERE SOME WHO ALLEGE THAT WE'VE CREATED A SYSTEM NOW WHERE PEOPLE WILL GO TO THIS RIGHT UNDER. AND NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS BECAUSE IT'S NOW A MISDEMEANOR FREE PASS AYE ONE WANT TO CREATE THROUGH THIS. A PROCESS WHERE PEOPLE SAY WHY GO DO IT'S GONNA GET EXPLAINS ANYWAYS. AND NOW IT'S LIKE HATE THOSE METAL WE DO IT'S EXPUNGED. AND SO JUST TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION I THINK AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CREATE A SYSTEM THAT IS FAIR FOR PEOPLE. AND CERTAINLY. THAT REWARDS THE THE INCENTIVE INSIDE OF A PERSON THAT SAYS HEY I WANT CHANGE AND I WANNA GO GET A JOB I WANT TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE. AMOUNTS ARE SURE THAT I FEEL COMFORTABLE ON. BUT I KNOW I MAY REGRET Y. SE BUT WANTING TO HELP THOSE WHO DON'T WANT TO CHANGE OUR LIFE I DON'T WANT TO HELP. AND I'D RATHER FOCUS MY RESOURCES ON THOSE WHO WANT TO DO SOMETHING WITH OUR LIVES. AS MR COURT. ARM. THE FIRST THING THEY SAY IS. WHAT FIRST OF ALL OF THE WITNESS NEXT YOU MISTER TANG COULD YOU? IDENTIFY YOURSELF AND AND WHO YOU REPRESENT. DAY JORDAN CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFETY JUSTICE. THANK YOU. ARE.ꓧTHINK VERY IMPORTANT WE ADVANCE THIS BILL TODAY. MISTER CHANG IS. AN EXEMPLARY A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE I KNOW THAT HE WILL BE WORKING WITH EVERYONE TO MAKE SURE IT IS FAIR. I ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT IF YOU HAVE MET THE PEOPLE. ARE UGLY WAS AFTER PROP FORTY SEVEN THERE WERE A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO. WERE SUDDENLY ELIGIBLE FOR EXPUNGEMENT. IT LETS A DIFFICULT PROCESS AND OU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER THAT THE PEOPLE WHO COMMIT THESE CRIMES TYPICALLY HAVE VERY COMPLICATED LIVES. AND THEY MAY NOT HAVE AS MUCH EDUCATION AS THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM HERE. AND AS A RESULT. AND EIGHTEEN PAGE. A PAPER IS VERY HARD TO DEAL WITH OR THE FACT THAT ONE PERSON YOU HAVE TWO DIFFERENT COURTS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TWO DIFFERENT EXPUNGEMENT STUDIO. AND THE. THE RESULTS CAN DIFFER COURT TO COURT. I THINK THIS IS IN THE CENTRAL BAIL. BECAUSE WHAT WE REALLY WANT. IS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE MADE A MISTAKE IN THE PAST TO BE ABLE TO GO FORWARD. AND THEY CAN'T GO FORWARD IN TO WORK LEGALLY IF THEY'RE PREVENTED FROM GETTING THAT WORK BY HAVING SOMETHING ON THEIR RECORD. SO I THINK IN TERMS OF MAKING THE BEST MOVE FORWARD. HAVE A SOCIETY WHERE PEOPLE CAN MAKE A LIVING. FARM THINGS OTHER THAN CRIME THIS WOULD BE A MAJOR STEP FORWARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHANG. AND. NO IF NO FURTHER QUESTIONS MISTER TING YOU MAKE LOVE THEY THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF REALLY JUST THINK MY COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMITTEE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE ALL YOUR QUESTIONS. THIS IS A IS A PROCESS BILL AS YOU COULD TELL IT'S TRYING TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS THAT IS. I AT THIS POINT NOT VERY USER FRIENDLY. A WE HAVE STE. THREE MAJOR STAKEHOLDERS IN THAT PROCESS THAT WE ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY TO SO THAT. THEY CAN BE PART OF THAT STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. ON IT AND SO I'VE I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS I THINK YOU ALL UNDERSTAND HOW DIFFICULT. AND COMPLICATED THIS PROCESSES. AND AGAIN JUST A ECHO ON THEIR WITNESSES POINT THAT THIS IS EVEN MORE CHALLENGING IF YOU'RE THE ONE AT THE BEGINNING OF THAT TRYING. PROCESS TRYING TO GET TO THE TOP. SO AGAIN HERE WE WILL ACTUALLY BE WORKING TO A FIND A WAY TO CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT PROBATION JUDICIAL COUNCIL DISK TWENTIES WILL HAVE THEIR ABILITY TO HAVE INPUT. WE ALSO DON'T WANT TO NOTSTREAMLINED THE PROCESS BECAUSE THERE'S A FEW EXCEPTIONS WHICH WHICH IS WHAT REALLY HAPPENS ARE A FEW EXCEPTIONS. THAT GET PULLED OUT OF THE MANDATORY IT EXPUNGEMENT PROCESS BUT WE DON'T WANT TO LET EVERYBODY ELSE SIT THERE IN PURGATORY BECAUSE OF THAT. SO AGAIN VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE CHAIR AYE AYE RECOMMENDATION VERY MUCH APPRECIATE ALL YOUR QUESTIONS WILL CONTINUE TO. WORK ON THIS AND AND I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A MORE. MORE REFINED BILL HOPEFULLY BY THE TIME IT IT IT CAN REACH THE FLOOR. THANK YOU. WITHOUT RESPECT US FOR ABOUT A DAY AND END UP AND I WOULD THANK YOU MISTER KING FOR. YOU KNOW LISTENING TO MY CONCERNS BUT AND. AND WHAT UNTIL I REALIZED. JUST RECENTLY THAT THAT YOU KNOW. POSSIBLY CHAIR OF BUDGET IN A CHAIR OF APPROACH. MIGHT BE. FAVORABLE TO ACTUALLY HELPING TO FUND IT BEFORE SEVENTY NINE WHICH I DIDN'T. THINK WOULD BE POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE. SO I'M GLAD SHE PULLED IT BACK BUT WE DO NEED TO LOOK AT. LOOK AT PEOPLE BEFOREHAND IF WE WANT TO DO THAT. M. WHATEVER THAT EXPENSES WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO. TO TO DO THAT AND AND TO PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS AND THE NET THE INTO TODAY. IF WE WANT TO HELP THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN. PROSECUTED FOR CRIMES THAT ARE NOW LEGAL. WELL THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT I WOULD ALSO. TAKE DIRECT MEDICATIONS OF OF OF THE MEMBERS HERE. WHO SAID COME TO OUR OFFICE AND EXPLAIN I FOR EXAMPLE SHARE? PUBLIC SAFETY I'VE HAD. HUNDREDS OF INDIVIDUALS COME TO ME AND TELL ME HOW DIFFICULT IT IS. I GET AN EXPUNGEMENT. AND I'VE HEARD FIRST HAND ALL THE HORROR STORIES AND I WOULD SUGGEST YOU BRING THOSE INDIVIDUALS INTO THESE OFFICES. SO THEY CAN RELAY THEIR THEIR DIRT. THERE DIFFICULTY TRYING TO GET THROUGH THE REGULAR EXPUNGEMENT PROCESS AND WHY YOU EVEN. TAKING THIS ON. BECAUSE. AS. SOME MEMBERS ARE SAYING. I JUST THINK ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS FILL OUT A PREFAB NOT. THE MEDIAN DATING JUST NEED PHILIP PIECE OF PAPER AND IT'S DONE. AND IT'S IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE AND IN SOME CASES IT MAY NOT EVEN BE FAIR AND OR MAYBE SOME PERSONAL PREJUDICES GOING ON EVEN IN THAT. AND WHICH I'VE HEARD AGAIN BRINGING SOMEONE INTO TO EXPLAIN WHAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH AND I GUESS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS. WHAT IS DEPRIVE I HAPPEN TO BE FAMILIAR WITH IT BECAUSE I'VE HEARD SO MANY STORIES? BUT I THEIR MEMBERS HERE I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE PROCESS IS AND THEN LASTLY I THINK YOU WILL. WILL MAKE SURE WE DON'T BOMB. WE DON'T END UP IN A SITUATION WHERE WE KNOWINGLY. CREATE A AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CRIMINALS TO ABUSES OF. THAT AND I. I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE GO ON OUR WAY TO THINK OF THE WHAT IFS. CRIMINALS WILL BE CRIME AND YOU TROUBLES GOING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET AROUND. ANYTHING WE DO. AND SO. BUT WHEN WE CONSCIOUSLY KNOW THAT THEY MIGHT. AND WE DON'T PUT ANY SAFEGUARDS. I THINK CLUB MEMBERS HERE WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME SOMETHING IN HERE THAT GIVES US SOME. SOME OF FEELING OF CONFIDENCE THAT THAT WON'T HAPPEN. AND SO THE CHURCH RECOMMENDING AND VOTE SO THAT WE CAN GO AHEAD AND. THE MOVE DISHONESTY MOVES TO. A COMMITTEE THAT I THINK WILL BE VERY GOOD AT. HELPING YOU GET TO THAT NEXT LEVEL. THAT THAT I NEED A MOTION AND A SECOND. ON AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY EIGHT THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER AYE AYE JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY. LACKEY NO CARILLO. CARILLO AYE GONZALEZ FLETCHER. GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE KILEY. KILEY NO QUIRK. QUIRK AYE SANTIAGO SUBJECTS I. THE MEASURE PASSES THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISTER PATTERSON. AB TWENTY FOUR OH FIVE AND AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTY SEVEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND OUT MEMBERS APPRECIATE THE. OPPORTUNITY OF OF PRESENTING A. B.. TWO FOUR ZERO FIVE. THE BEGINNINGS OF OF. THIS BILL. WHICH REALLY WITHOUT. THE AWAKENING OF THE OF THE OUR OPIOID A CRISIS. AND ALL OF THE INTER PLAYING. REALITIES THAT ARE COMING DOWN. AS A RESULT OF. OPIOIDS WE KNOW ABOUT BUT ALSO OPIOIDS THAT ARE. OFTEN TIMES. HIDDEN OR OR CUTTING IN MIXED WITH. WITH OTHER DRUGS AND. THERE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THESE PARTICULAR DRUGS. SO. A AB TWO FOUR OH FIVE ADDRESSES. CAR FENTANYL. IT IS AN OPIOID. IT IS TEN THOUSAND TIMES MORE POTENT THAN MORPHINE. AT IT IS INTENDED USE IS AS A SEDATIVE FOR ELEPHANTS. IT ONLY TAKES A FEW GRANULES A FEW GRANULES. OF CAR FEDERAL THE SIZE OF GRAINS OF TABLET SALT. KILL SOMEONE. HOWEVER THE DANGER OF THIS DRUG. IS NOT REFLECTED IN OUR CURRENT LAWS. IN A COUPLE OF AREAS. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT I THINK IS IT IS NOT A SCHEDULE TWO DRUG. SO AB TWO FOUR OH FIVE WILL ADD CAR FEDERAL TO THE LIST. SCHEDULED TO DRUGS. IN ORDER TO HIGHLIGHT TO THE. GROWING THREAT OF THIS PARTICULAR. A DRUG THAT IT THAT IT POSES. BUT ALSO A IN ORDER TO CLEAR UP THE AMBIGUITIES THAT UP RESULT IN CAR FENTON ALL BEING IN SOME IN SOME WAYS A. EITHER A DERIVATIVE. A OF. ONE OF OF OFFEND ALL BUT. NOT THAT THE THE BIGGER PROBLEM HERE IS THAT IT IT IS IT IT LITERALLY IS. A OFTENTIMES. THE HIDDEN FROM. THIS SCHEDULE TO. PROSECUTION AND CONVICTION AND SO BRINGING IT OUT OF THAT UNCERTAINTY IN AMBIGUITY. IS WHAT THE BILL DOES AS WELL IT IT IS IMPORTANT. TO KNOW WHAT THE BILL DOESN'T DO WE DO NOT. A PUNISH IN THIS BILL THE USER. INSTEAD WE FOCUS. ON STOPPING INDIVIDUALS. M. HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE WITH PENALTIES. WHO WILLFULLY AND INTENTIONALLY USE THE DRUG? AND SALAS. THE IS AGAIN IT IS NOT THE USERS THAT WE ARE GOING AFTER IT IS THOSE WHO ARE. CUTTING IT MIXING IT. S. AND SELLING IT IN AND TRANSPORTING IT FOR SALE. AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE BUT WE WANT TO HAVE TO ELEVATE THIS TO THIS KIND OF ATTENTION. ISN'T IT IT IT IS SUCH A TERRIBLE DRUG. ARE. DEADLY. ARE. M. IT THE AMBIGUOUS WITH RESPECT TO. THOSE WHO SELL AND DISTRIBUTE THAT. A CAR FEDERAL THAT WE WANT TO. MAKE THAT VERY VERY CLEAR IN THE LAW. AND HELP US UNDERSTAND THAT I'VE OF WITH ME TODAY MISTER FLINT ANDERSON. WHO IS THE FOUNDER OF PARENTS AND ADDICTS IN NEED? AND HE'S HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU MISTER PATTERSON A THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY TODAY. YES I AM FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT PAIN PARENTS IN ATTICS IN NEED. I AM ALSO A RECOVERING DRUG ADDICT OF SEVENTEEN YEARS OF SOBRIETY I HAD A TWENTY THREE YEAR ADDICTION TO OPIATES. AND YOU KNOW AGAIN WE AS YOU ALL KNOW WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF AN OPIOID CRISIS THAT MAKES HIV LOOK LIKE COLD AND FLU SEASON. THIS IS THIS IS LITERALLY KILLING LITERALLY KILLING. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE EVERY DAY. AND THE FACT THE MATTER IS IS THAT CAR FENTON ALL NOW IS A SYNTHETIC OPIOID THAT IS MAN MADE. AND IT IS BEING SHIPPED INTO OUR BORDERS ALONG THE EASTERN SEABOARD AND AT SEA BOARD AND THE AND THE AND THE WEST COAST. THE FACT THE MATTER IS IS THAT THESE DRUGS ARE KILLING THESE KIDS IT'S TASTELESS IT'S ODORLESS. NOBODY EVEN KNOWS THAT IT IS ON THE DRUG THEY ARE LAY SEEN ST NORCO WITH THAT ST VIKING AND WHAT THAT ST LORD HAVE WITH THAT. THEY'RE LACING HEROIN WITH IT AND NOT EVEN. TELLING. THE END USER THAT THAT IT IS LACED WITH THIS. AND JUST SO YOU DO NOW. I'D NOR CAN IS INEFFECTIVE AGAINST CAR FENTON ALL. BY THE TIME YOU TAKE THIS AND USED AS FIRST RESPONDERS ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SAVE THEIR LIVES WITH MARK AND. THEY'RE LITERALLY DEAD BEFORE THEY HIT THE GROUND. THIS THIS THIS IS A CRISIS THAT THAT HAS WE HAVE FORESEEN THIS COMING FOR QUITE SOMETIME. NOT ONLY IS THIS RUINING. THE PERSON THAT IS USING THE DRUG IT IS RUINING THEIR FAMILIES AS WELL. WE'VE SEEN OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED FAMILIES IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND SENT OVER FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE TO TREATMENT. AND THESE ARE ALL IN THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLDS. I BEEN TO NINETEEN FUNERALS. IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS HALL FROM OVERDOSE. AND THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT WE KNOW OF. WE KNOW WE ARE IN A BATTLE WE ARE NO WE KNOW WE HAVE TO CHANGE US AND WE HAVE TO FIX THIS SOMEHOW SOME WAY. AND I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WILL HAVE A LOT OF AFFECT ON THOSE THAT ARE MANUFACTURING THIS DRUG. AND KILLING OUR CHILDREN WITH IT. THIS THIS IS THIS IS NO LONGER. SOMEBODY ELSE'S PROBLEM. THIS IS NO LONGER IT'S IT JUST HAPPENS TO SOMEBODY ELSE. THIS AFFECTS ALL PEOPLE. ALL RACES. IT AFFECTS EVERYONE WHETHER WHETHER WHETHER YOU LIVE ON ONE SIDE OF TOWN OR THE OTHER. WE WE HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE AND GET AN OUR PROGRAMS THAT WERE THAT WERE COLLEGE BASEBALL PLAYERS. THAT STARTED OUT WITH THE TYPICAL OPIOID FOR THEIR PAIN. AND NOW BECAUSE THEY THEY THEY THAT PAIN KILLER NO LONGER DOES THE TRICK FOR THEM. NOW THEY TURN TO STRONGER DRUGS THEY TURN TO OXYCONTIN THE CHURCH YOU HEROIN. THIS IS THIS IS A FACT OF LIFE THIS IS WHAT IS GOING ON ALL ACROSS OUR STATE. AND OF COURSE I ALWAYS GET ASKED THE QUESTION ESPECIALLY BY PARENTS. CAN CAN AND AT THE CAN MARIJUANA KILL YOU AND OF COURSE MY ANSWER WAS ALWAYS NO. TODAY IT'S A RESOUNDING YES. BECAUSE DRUG DEALERS ALSO LACED MARIJUANA. WITH CAR FENTON ALL. AND WHEN YOU CAN'T SMELL IT AND YOU CAN'T TASTE IT AND YOU CAN'T FEEL IT. AND YOU INGEST IT. IT IS A NINETY NINE POINT NINE PERCENT CHANCE YOU'RE GOING TO DIE ON THE SPOT. WITH WITH WITHOUT HELP FROM ANYBODY OR ANY OTHER DRUG TO HELP YOU PULL YOURSELF OUT OF IT. I AM IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. I AM STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND I THANK MISTER PATTERSON.

LUCIA MUCH ROBBIE HAVE TO CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION AND THE VIET BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CRIME LAB DIRECTORS AND SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. ARI ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE GOING BACK AS FOR DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE. THE AUTHOR HAS IDENTIFIED A REAL PROBLEM. THE RATE OF DRUG OVERDOSE RELATED TO OPIOIDS INCLUDING CAR FENNEL AND FENNEL. IS WIDESPREAD IN WORSENING. HOWEVER THIS SOLUTIONS FOR THE OVERDOSE CRISIS PRIMARILY BE FOUND HEALTH COMMITTEE AND HEALTH BUDGET. IF THERE IN THIS COMMITTEE THEY WILL NOT BE DRAMATICALLY INCREASING PENALTIES BY FOUR TO FIFTEEN YEARS. WE'VE HAD THE DRUG WAR FOR FORTY YEARS FOR FORTY YEARS WE'VE RESEARCH THE EFFECTS OF LONG SENTENCES. AND THE EFFECTS OF LONG SENTENCES DID NOT REDUCE THE AVAILABILITY OF DRUGS. SURELY DO NOT REDUCE THE SPREAD OF HIV AND. HEPATITIS AN OVERDOSE RELATED TO DRUGS DRUGS ARE STRONGER. CHEAPER AND MORE AVAILABLE THAN EVER BEFORE SO THIS TYPE OF SOLUTION DIDN'T WORK AND SHOULD NOT BE REPLICATED. THE. RESEARCH IS ROBUST AND FINDS THAT IT DOES NOT REDUCE AVAILABILITY. THAT YOU TAKE ONE DRUG. SELLER OFFER THE STREET FOR A SHORT PERIOD TIME OR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME THEY WILL REAP. REPLACED BY ANOTHER DRUG SELLER BECAUSE THIS IS A DEMAND MARKET. THAT'S WHY DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE AND OUR ALLY SUPPORT. PREVENTION TREATMENT CAN HARM REDUCTION. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES PUBLISHED A FOUR HUNDRED FORTY FOUR PAGE REPORT. ON THE AFFECT. ON THE AFFECTS OF GET TOUGH PENALTIES WHAT IS THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCE BASED ON THE AVAILABLE RESEARCH OVER FORTY YEARS. IT'S THE REDUCTION OF PENALTIES REDUCTION OF THE PRISON POPULATION AND SPENDING ARE LIMITED GOVERNMENT MONEY ON PREVENTION TREATMENT AND HARM REDUCTION. BY THE WAY AS I BELIEVE THE AUTHORS ACKNOWLEDGE MUCH OF THE ADDITION OF FENTANYL IN CARBONDALE. TO THE. TO DRUGS HAPPENS BEFORE IT ENTERS THE. ST BEFORE ENTERS THE NATION HAPPENS OUTSIDE OF THE U. S.. EVEN PEOPLE WHO ARE POSSESSING FOR SALE OR CAN TO SELL SMALL AMOUNTS OF HEROIN MAY NOT KNOW THAT THERE'S CAR FENELLA FENN THOUGH IN THE PRODUCT SO THEY WOULD BE SUBJECT TO EXTREMELY HIGH PENALTIES. WITHOUT INTENT. I WANT TO. WRAP UP AND ALSO SAY THAT MY COMMENTS WILL APPLY TO THE OTHER BILL RELATED TO MASSIVE A INCREASE IN PENALTIES SO I WILL NOT. A OVER USE THE TIME OF THE COMMITTEE. I DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO SOLVE A PROBLEM AND WOULD WELCOME THE CHANCE TO WORK WITH HIM AND OTHERS. ON. POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN EVALUATEDTO WORK IN REDUCING DEATH DISABILITY AND SUFFERING. THANK YOU. CATHY SURE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA I WILL JUST JOIN IN THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE AND SAY THAT WE KNOW THAT INCREASED SENTENCES ARE NOT THE ANSWER TO THE. EPIDEMIC OF OPIOID ABUSE BUT INDEED DIVERT RESOURCES THE FROM THE THINGS THAT WORK LIKE TREATMENT AND HARM REDUCTION AND WE ASK FOR YOUR NOBLE. THANK YOU OTHER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MISTER QUIRK YEAH I'M FIRST OF ALL OF THE WITNESS FOR THE BILL. AGE VERY SERIOUS PLEASE NEVER SAY IT'S LIKE CULT BUT DON'T SAY ANYTHING PLEASE. SECOND I AGREE VERY MUCH WITH THE. A TESTIMONY WITH MISTER GLENN BACK HAS. IT IS DEFINITELY THE CASE THAT IF WE'RE GONNA SPEND MONEY WHAT WE OUGHT TO SPEND IT ON THIS TREATMENT. AND. YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD A WAR ON DRUGS WE HAD INCREASES IN PENALTIES. I DON'T THINK IT EVER DID ANY GOOD. PUTTING MORE PEOPLE IN PRISON IS A LOT OF MONEY IT WOULD BE BETTER SPENT IN OTHER WAYS THANK YOU. IT'S MUCH CARILLO. I THINK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL TORE ATTENTION I'LL ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE MISTER QUIRK WHO. WELL LET ME LET ME SAY THIS AT COST ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO INCARCERATE SOMEONE IN PRISON AND LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS FOR LA COUNTY MY COUNTY IT'S ABOUT FORTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS. IT'S A LOT OF MONEY IN FACT ARE COUNTY JAIL SYSTEMS ALREADY OVERCROWDED. FOLKS I SHOULD BE THERE BECAUSE THEY'RE WAITING FOR BAIL OUR HELP LONGER. OF PUTTING SOMEONE IN PRISON COUNTY JAIL PUTTING SOMEONE IN COUNTY JAIL FOR FIFTEEN YEARS IS ALREADY. LOOKING AT THE PROBLEM IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T FIND A SOLUTION IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE GET DRUGS OFF THE STREETS TO BEGIN WITH AND SO. IT'S A LOT OF MONEY TO CONTINUE TO INCARCERATE FOLKS. WE KNOW DISPROPORTIONATELY THIS IMPACTS PEOPLE OF COLOR. AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO MEN PREDOMINATELY. AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WAYS IN WHICH WE THINK ABOUT A REHABILITATION. AND THINK ABOUT BETTER SPEND TAXPAYER DOLLARS ON MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITY EQUITY AND JUSTICE SO THAT THEY'RE NOT. HAVE COMMITTING THESE CRIMES TO BEGIN WITH AND I DO THINK THAT IT IS AN EPIDEMIC I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE. A REALLY SERIOUS ISSUE ON OUR HANDS I'M NOT SURE THAT INCARCERATING FOLKS FOR FIFTEEN YEARS IS THE RIGHT ANSWER TO THAT. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE PROVIDE TO OUR ATTENTION. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENT. MR PASSION YOU MAKE CLOTHES I I REALLY. FIRST OF ALL BOB WANNA MAKE SURE WE DON'T THAT. CONFLATING CONNECT OF WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE. A. USERS ARE NOT A PART OF THIS EFFORT. ARE WE RECOGNIZE THAT USERS. ARE IN MANY TIMES VICTIMIZED. WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH HERE IS A HORRIBLE DRUG THAT IS INCREASINGLY FINDING ITS WAY? UP INTO THE THE THE VERY CARTELS IN THE VERY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE CRIMINAL. AT AND ARE CREATING THESE KINDS OF PROBLEMS AND IF THAT IS NOT A LAW ENFORCEMENT ISSUE I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS. I ALSO WITH WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THERE ARE DIFFERING. OPINIONS AND POINTS OF VIEW WITH RESPECT TO WHETHER OR NOT THIS APPROACH. A IS MERITORIOUS AYE THINK IT IS. A LITTLE BIT ONE SIDED TO. IGNORE THE SUPPORT OF. AT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S THE PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION THE POLICE CHIEF OUR SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION'S. THE DEPUTY SHERIFFS UP OF PEOPLE TREATING A PEOPLE A FOR THESE KINDS OF ADDICTIONS. THAT THERE DOES COME A POINT IN WHICH A PARTICULAR DRUG AND AND THE. PURPOSEFUL A WOULDN'T BLENDING EVIDENT AND SELLING IT TO PEOPLE RISES TO A LEVEL OF A SIGNIFICANT. CRIME THAT SHOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PENALTY. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND I APPRECIATE THE. A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW HERE BUT I THINK WE HAVE SEPARATED DEL. FROM USERS AND I THINK WE HAVE RAISED A. REAL WARNING FLAG. OVER WHAT CAR FENTON ALL IS CAPABLE OF DOING EN IS IN DOING IT AND DOING NOW. I HOPE I AM NOT. PROPHETIC HERE I HOPE I'M NOT BACK BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE OR OTHERS COMMITTEE ON I SERVE ON THE. HAVE SERVED ON THE HEALTH COMMITTEE AS WELL I UNDERSTAND THESE KINDS OF THINGS. BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT I THINK THERE'S A TICKING TIME BOMB COMING AND I DO BELIEVE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND. PENALTIES THAT REALLY DO THAT THAT SIGNAL VERY CLEARLY THAT THAT THIS KIND OF DRUG SELLING IT. I IS GOING TO COME WITH SOME SEVERE PENALTIES I THINK THAT IS HELPFUL ALL THINGS CONSIDERED SO I APPRECIATE YOU HEARING. THE BILL AND WOULD ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER PATTERSON AND I KNOW. ON BECAUSE WE'VE SPOKEN ON THE FLOOR IN AND DAY OUT SEVERAL CASE I KNOW YOU. WE GENERALLY WANT TO DO SOMETHING. AND NEWT AND YOU TRULY BELIEVE. ON THAT THIS PARTICULAR METHODOLOGY IS THE WAY TO MOVE FORWARD. AND WE'RE ALL ENTITLED TO. DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON HOW TO COME TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. I WORKED. IN A MORTUARY BUSINESS FROM. SEVENTY NINE TO ABOUT NINETEEN NINETY. AND I SAW WHAT THE CRACK COCAINE EPIDEMIC DID I REMEMBER LAWS. THAT CAME ABOUT HOW AFRAID WE WERE. AND HOW WE THOUGHT THREE STRIKES. WITH THE WAY. TO GET OUT OF THE CRACK COCAINE EPIDEMIC. BUT ALSO SAW THE NUMBER OF DAMAGE FAMILIES. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO DIED. BOTH ON THE CRIMINAL SIDE FROM SELLING IT IN KILLING EACH OTHER TO PEOPLE WHO. SMOKERS CELLS INTO AN EARLY GRAVE AND FAMILIES JUST DESTROYED INSIDE. UNBELIEVABLY SYMPATHETIC. WITH WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO. BUT I ALSO NOW THAT THE METHODOLOGY THAT WE USED AT THAT TIME TRYING TO JAIL AWAY. OUT OF THE EPIDEMIC I THINK ULTIMATELY. PEOPLE. STOP USING IT OR WE STARTED USING MORE STARGATE MORE HELP AND WE JUST STARTED GETTING HEALTHY. AND A HEALTHY WE GOT WE KINDA GOT OUT OF THAT THAT AT THE CRACK COCAINE EPIDEMIC. BUT. ANOTHER ONE COMES UP AGAIN AND AGAIN. AND SO HEALING PEOPLE AT THE BEGINNING ON. TEACHING PEOPLE HAVE. IF THIS GENTLEMAN WHO ARE TYPICALLY. SAID AND I AGAIN I. I CAN FIGURE PASSION FOR FOR THIS AND I APPRECIATED. NAM. BUT I'M. I'M HOPEFULLY. DAVID BEATING JAIL YOU AWAY BUT WE CAN. CARSON RATE YOU THE POINT WHERE YOU GOT OFF DRUGS THAT YOU'VE GOT SOME KIND OF. HELP. TO TO GET OFF OF THAT AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM SOME OF THE MEMBERS HERE THAT LET'S GIVE THIS A TRY. LET'S START. USING YOUR HEALTH COMMITTEE FUNDING FOR THAT TO GO AND THEN GET RID OF THE CUSTOMERS. AND STOPS INDIVIDUALS FROM GETTING TRAPPED INTO THAT AND SO. THAT'S WHY I RECOMMEND NO VOTE SO THAT WE CAN. GET SOMEBODY'S THESE THESE PROGRAMS STARTED. WE CAN START GETTING PEOPLE FUNNELED INTO THEM AND WE ULTIMATELY ARE ARE ABLE TO DO SOME GOOD SAW. UNFORTUNATELY I'M ENOUGH TO RECOMMEND THE NO VOTE. HELP. THAT CYCLICAL ROLE. ON AB TWENTY FOUR FIVE THE MOTION IS TO PASSED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. NO JONES SAWYER NO LACKEY LACKEY I CARILLO. CARILLO NO GONZALEZ FLETCHER. GONZALEZ FLETCHER NO KILEY. KILEY AYE QUIRK. QUIRK NO SANTIAGO. SANTIAGO NO. SORRY THAT MEASURE FAILS. YEAH WOULD I'D LIKE TO REQUEST RECONSIDERATION PLEASE. AND BY UNANIMOUS CONSENT IF THIS IF THIS ISN'T THE APPROPRIATE TIME OR. THAT TALKED WITH MILLER BUT ABOUT IT. LOOK LATER WHAT BY ANOTHER RECONSIDERATION I DON'T KNOW WHETHER. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IN THE IN THE CAR FENTON A BILL. WE WERE ALSO SEEKING TO A ATTITUDE. AS A SCHEDULE. TO DRUG. I THINK THAT'S NOT GOING TO DO ANY ENHANCEMENT THAT'S NOT GOING TO ADD ANY ADDITIONAL TIME. BUT WHAT IT WILL DO IS MAKE IT VERY VERY CLEAR. WITH RESPECT TO PROSECUTIONS THAT IT IS A IT IS IT IS IN FACT TAKE A SCHEDULE TWO DRUG WE CAN DISCUSS IT AFTER THIS RIGHT NOW THAT BILLS FAILS BECAUSE I STAND AT. CURRENT BUT I'M WILLING. DISCUSS ANYTHING. YOU WANNA BRING UP CHAIR THANK YOU. TWENTY FOUR SIXTY SEVEN. AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AYE. BOB. OBVIOUSLY PHANTOM ALL IS A MUCH MORE IDENTIFIABLE. NAME TO A DRUG AND I THINK WE ARE ALL. VERY AWARE OF WHAT IT HAS DONE. THE SACRAMENTO AREA WAS. INUNDATED WITH. DEATHS. WITH RESPECT TO IT SOMETIME BACK. IT IS A VERY POWERFUL ANESTHETIC IT'S FIFTY TIMES MORE POTENT THAN HEROIN. A HUNDRED TIMES MORE POTENT THAN MORPHINE. ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THE RAPID SPREAD OF FENTON ALL IS THAT IT OFFERS A VERY HIGH PROFIT MARGIN. THE TRAFFICKERS. CHAIRMAN THAT RAISING THE BAR ON THE PENALTY FOR TRAFFICKERS. IS A VERY EFFECTIVE WAY A TWO HERB SHED SOME OF THOSE PROFITS AND MAKE IT MUCH MORE ENTICING AN INTERESTING TO DO THE DEED IN THE FIRST PLACE. I THINK THERE IS AN IMPORTANT LAW ENFORCEMENT ASPECT TO THIS ACCORDING TO THE D. E. A. A TRAFFICKER. TYPICALLY PURCHASES A KILOGRAM OF FEDERAL FOR A FEW THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM A CHINESE SUPPLIER. EASILY TRANSFORMS THAT INTO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS. OF PILLS. AND THE. STREET MARKET. VALUE TURNS THAT. THOUSAND DOLLARS INTO MILLIONS MILLIONS. OF DOLLARS. LONG FORSMAN OFFICERS HAVE SEIZED MORE THAN A KILOGRAM AFFECT NOW IN LOS ANGELES. IN SAN FRANCISCO SINCERO CHULA VISTA AND OTHER CALIFORNIA CITIES. AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTY SEVEN. ADDS A SENTENCING ENHANCEMENT FOR THE POSSESSION FOR SALE AND FOR TRANSPORT. FOR SALE AGAIN WE ARE NOT. ATTEMPTING TO. PUNISH THE USER. BUT TO INSTEAD FOCUS ON THE DRUG TRAFFICKER. AND. I MEAN I I RECOGNIZE THAT WE'VE WE THERE IS A HEALTH COMPONENT TO THIS. AND GETTING THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE PART ARE HOOKED ON THIS KIND OF. OF STUFF THE KIND OF HELP IN THE IN THE TREATMENT THEY NEED. BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THERE IS A CONSEQUENTIAL SIDE AND THERE IS ALSO. A A A PUNITIVE SIDE THAT IN FACT I ACTUALLY BELIEVE. AND THERE'S. REPORT THAT THE BILL HAS ARE FROM INSTITUTIONS AND INDIVIDUALS WHO SEE A CONNECTION. BETWEEN THE TRAFFICKERS. OF BEING ABLE TO EXTRACT PENALTIES AN TO ESSENTIALLY SIGNAL THAT THIS IS THE KIND OF. THE HORRIBLE DRUG THAT IS. YEAH. WORSE CONSEQUENCES IN AN EASIER FOR TRAFFICKERS. TO MAKE BIG PROFITS. I THINK WE GOTTA START CUTTING INTO THEIR PROFITS AS WELL I THINK THERE'S A SUPPLY SIDE. QUESTION I THINK THERE'S A DEMAND SIDE QUESTION. BUT I DO THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE WE'RE NOT PUNISHING THE USERS. THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS AND CARTELS WHO KNOWINGLY. A GET THESE. AMOUNTS CUT THEM UP. AND KILL PEOPLE WITH IT KNOWINGLY. I THINK THEY NEED TO. KNOWINGLY A APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THERE WILL BE ENHANCED CONSEQUENCES FOR. THAT KIND OF. DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR. SO I'M GOING TO ASK FOR SUPPORT OF THE BILL AGAIN RECOGNIZING THAT. THERE ARE THE POINTS OF VIEW THAT ARE. VERY MUCH DIFFERENT DATA FROM. THOSE WHO ARE IN SUPPORT OF OF THE BILL HERE AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I UNDERSTAND IT. BUT I DO WANT YOU TO HEAR FROM PAM SMITH IS A CONSTITUENT IN MY DISTRICT. AND AGAIN FROM MISTER MISTER FLINT ANDERSON FOUNDER. OF PARENTS IN ATTICS IN NEED THEM THEY HAVE. ABSOLUTE IN SPECIFIC. EXPERIENCE WITH THE HORRORS OF PROFESSIONAL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

TO QUICKLY REITERATE PAM'S. THERE ARE SOME. CIRCUMSTANCES AND SOME PEOPLE WHO ACT IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MUST RAISE THE PENALTY FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.

NO THAT I AND THE JOINT AUTHORED THIS MEASURE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA BUT HE COULDN'T BE WITH US TODAY SOME PRESENTING. FOR BOTH OF US AND I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS WHICH WE ACCEPT. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE NAME OF VICTIMS AND WITNESSES TO GANG CRIMES. I CAN BE ACCESSED USING A PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST. THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE THAT WHERE A VICTIM OR A WITNESS TO A GANG CRIME REQUESTS CONFIDENTIALITY. THEIR NAME WOULD BE REDACTED. AND ANY REPORTS AND DOCUMENTS. BEFORE THOSE DOCUMENTS OR RELEASED PURSUANT TO PR A REQUEST. SIMILAR CONFIDENTIALITY PROTECTIONS EXISTING CURRENT LAW FOR VICTIMS OF SEX CRIMES AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. OFFENSES BUT NOT TO GANG RELATED OFFENSES ON THIS BILL WOULD. AT A MODEST LAYER PROTECTION TO VICTIMS OR WITNESSES. AND HOPEFULLY DETER WITNESS INTIMIDATION EFFORTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MY NAME IS GOVERNMENT CAM THE SERGEANT WITH THE SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE. THIS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL. I MADE THIS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL FIDEL. I MADE THIS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL. A TO ASSEMBLYMAN COURT CUNNINGHAM'S OFFICE ON THIS RESULT OF SOME EXPERIENCE AND A PARTICULAR CASE THAT I INVESTIGATED IN. JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. ASKING ME. DURING THAT TIME PERIOD I WAS ASSIGNED AS A GANG DETECTIVE TO THE SALAS WAS WILL COUNTY GANG TASK FORCE. AND WAS INVESTIGATING. A CASE IN WHICH A FOR FRESNO BULLDOGS. CAME TO APPLE BEACH. AND. ASSAULTED A GROUP OF FRIENDS THAT WERE AT A FARMER'S MARKET. I DURING THIS IS THE ASSAULT WAS A RESULT. OF A BRIEF. A REFUSAL OF HAVEN'T ADVANCED THAT ONE OF THE OTHER GANG MEMBERS IT MAY TOWARDS OF ONE OF THE FEMALE VICTIMS. THE THE BULLDOGS DECIDED IN RETALIATION THAT WOULD RESULT THESE FRIENDS. AND DURING THE COURSE OF THE ASSAULT. ONE OF THE THE GAMING MEMBERS PICKED UP A PARTIALLY FULL CORONA BEER BOTTLE AND THREW IT. AT THE FEMALE VICTIM SAID CAUSING A SKULL FRACTURE IN A LARGE LACERATION REQUIRED MEDICAL TREATMENT AT A HOSPITAL. AS I WAS CONDUCTING FALL OF INVESTIGATION AND IDENTIFIED. TWO DIFFERENT COUPLES. THAT WERE WITNESSES IN THIS CASE. THEY WERE CONSIDERED REALLY GOOD WITNESSES. AND THEY HAD SEEN THE WHOLE ATTACK. THEY'RE UNBIASED THEY HAD NO PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SUSPECTS OR THE VICTIMS. AND THEY WERE ARTICULATE AND BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WHAT THEY SAW EFFECTIVELY. A ONE OF THE ONE OF THESE BIG ERRORS EXCUSE ME ONE OF THESE WITNESSES WAS A REGISTERED NURSE SHE PROVIDED MEDICAL AID TO THE VICTIM ON SCENE WHILE WAITING FOR THE AMBULANCE TO ARRIVE. AS AS A SPEAKING TO. THIS THIS WITNESS. AND WE BEGAN TALKING ABOUT WHAT TYPE PROTECTIONS SHE HAD AS A WITNESS SHE KNEW THAT THE SUSPECTS IN THIS CASE WERE BULLDOGS SHOOTS PER MILLION WITH THAT GANG. AND SHE WAS FEARFUL OF RETALIATION AGAINST HERSELF MISTER FAMILY. AND AGAINST HER HUSBAND. WHEN EXPLAINED TO HER THAT. ON HER NAME WOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE POLICE REPORT. SHE DECIDED THAT SHE DID NOT WANT TO COOPERATE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE INVESTIGATION REQUESTED THAT ALL. DOCUMENTATION ON. BE. STOPPED IN HER INTERVIEW. UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS KIND OF A COMMON EXPERIENCE THAT WE HAVE IS AS GANG. DETECTIVES AND INVESTIGATORS. MANY CRIMES GO UNREPORTED OR IF THEY ARE REPORTED THEIR. IT'S DIFFICULT TO SOLVE THEM BECAUSE IT'S DIFFICULT TO HAVE WITNESSES THAT ARE WILLING TO ASSIST US. I BELIEVE THAT THIS THIS BILL WOULD. PROVIDE SOME LEVEL. OF. COMFORTING WITNESSES THAT DO WANT TO HELP AND THE SUCH INVESTIGATIONS PERFECT BETTER FEARFUL OF RETALIATION. AND THIS LEGISLATION IN NO WAYS INTENDED TO CIRCUMVENT DISCOVERY REQUIREMENTS IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS SIXTH AMENDMENT RIGHT TO CONFRONT WITNESSES AGAINST HIM OR HER. WILL NOT BE INFRINGED ON BY THIS LEGISLATION. THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY WOULD STILL BE PROVIDED. WITH ALL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION OF WITNESSES NECESSARY. TO MOUNT A COMPETENT AND REASONABLE DEFENSE FOR THEIR CLIENT. I STRONGLY. REQUEST THAT YOU SUPPORT THIS BILL I THINK THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAYS TO ASSISTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND MAKING ALL OF OUR COMMUNITY SAFER THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THINK THANK YOU. AND YET ONE MORE MINUTE DO YOU WANNA. YOU NO ALONSO GARZA FOUNDER. OF MOTHER'S EGGMAN AGAINST BANKS COALITION. MOTHER AND VOICE OF MARTINEZ BUT THE CARS OF. WHOM WAS TAKEN. ON JANUARY SIXTH TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN BY A GANG MEMBER. IN JANUARY I CAME BEFORE YOU'RE SIMPLY. WITH. ASSEMBLYMAN. NUMBER OF THE AUTHOR GARCIA. AND ALL OF YOU. AGREED UPON ONE THING THAT WE HAVE A GANG PROBLEM. AND IT IT'S TIME TO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT GANG PROBLEM. I THINK ACR ONE THIRTY FOUR. DECLARING JANUARY GANG AWARENESS AND PREVENTION MONTH WAS THE FIRST STEP WE NEEDED TO TAKE. I FEEL FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE GIVEN A VOICE HERE AS A MOTHER. BUT I ASK RESPECTFULLY TO GIVE ME. TWO ADDITIONAL MINUTES FOR MY SON AND TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED. JANUARY FIFTH. MY SON WENT OUT WITH THE SISTER. AND UNFORTUNATELY MATT. WITH. SOME FRIENDS AND DECIDED TO MEET. NEW PEOPLE. UNFORTUNATELY A COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE THAT PERPETRATOR WAS RELEASED ON A PLEA DEAL BECAUSE. THERE WAS A LACK OF WITNESSES DUE TO THE LACK OF PROTECTION FOR GANG CRIME. WITNESSES AND VICTIMS. PERSON DID MINIMUM TIME. WAS RELEASED ON THURSDAY. AND ON SATURDAY NIGHT. IT KILLED MY SON. AND CHANGED MY JOURNEY. AND. MY FAMILY'S FUTURE FOR EVER. FOUR DAYS LATER ON JANUARY TENTH TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. I DECIDED I PUT MY PURSE DOWN AS A MOTHER. AS A COMMUNITY MEMBER AS A TEACHER. TO MAKE SURE THAT NOTHER FAMILY DID NOT EXPERIENCE THIS. I HAVE TAKEN IT UPON. MYSELF AND THOSE THAT SUPPORT US. TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS VOICES ARE HEARD. I SAT HERE FOR ABOUT TWO AND HALF HOURS LISTENING TO SO MANY. CASES. AND ALMOST EVERY TIME I WANTED TO GET UP AND SAY SOMETHING BECAUSE IT. IT RELATED SO MUCH TO MY SON'S CASE. BUT TODAY. I WANT TO ASK EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU TO PUT YOUR PURSE DOWN LIKE MY FAMILY DEAD. LIKE THE WITNESSES. THAT WE WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE. AGAINST. EVERY NOW AND. GANG MEMBERS THAT HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO BE STOPPED. AND IT WAS THROUGH THE PASSION AND THE NURTURING THAT OUR FAMILY DID. FOR EACH AND EVERYONE OF THESE WITNESSES THAT WE ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE JUSTICE. BUT NOT JUST OUR FAMILY DESERVES JUST. ALL FAMILIES OF GANG CRIME DESERVE JUSTICE. I'M PROTECTION. AND I ASK THAT EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU PLEASE VOTE IN FAVOR. AND SUPPORT. ASSEMBLYMEMBER CUNNINGHAM'S LEGISLATION. A BLACK TWENTY THIRTY. THANK YOU OR ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. CHEN MEMBERS ARE SHOWN MUCH LOBBY HAVE TO CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION KATHY SURE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. FIRST LET ME EXPRESS MY CONDOLENCES TO THE WITNESS WHO JUST SPOKE. AND SAY. WE AGREE THAT ALL THAT ALL FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA DESERVE JUSTICE. AND THAT CUTE INCLUDES BOTH THE FAMILIES OF VICTIMS AND THE FAMILIES OF PERSONS WHO ARE ACCUSED OF GRANT AND CRIMES AND OTHER CRIMES. WE BELIEVE THAT PUBLIC OVERSIGHT OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS ESSENTIAL TO THE PROTECTION OF LIBERTY. FOR ALL OF US. THE POWER EXERCISED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN CRIMINAL CASES IS THE GREATEST OF GOVERNMENTAL POWERS THE POWER TO DEPRIVE AN INDIVIDUAL OF HIS LIBERTY. THE NEED TO EXERCISE THAT POWER OAK OPEN TO PUBLIC VIEW IS EXPRESSED IN THE SIXTH AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION. WHICH PROTECTS THE RIGHT OF THE ACCUSED TO A PUBLIC TRIAL AND TO CONFRONT WITNESSES AGAINST HIM. I AM IN CALIFORNIA THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT FURTHER SUPPORTS PUBLIC OVERSIGHT OF THE CUP CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. BY ENSURING THAT THE PUBLIC HAS ACCESS TO THE RECORDS OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND CAN REVIEW IN ONE CASE OR AS TO MANY CASES WHETHER JUSTICE IS BEING DONE. WE WOULD ARGUE THAT KEEPING A STE CASES OPEN TO PUBLIC USE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN GANG CASES WHERE INDIVIDUALS ARE PROSECUTED NOT SOLELY ON THE BASIS OF THEIR ACTIONS BUT ALSO ON THE BASIS OF THEIR ASSOCIATIONS. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE OVERSIGHT THAT IS PROVIDE PROVIDED UNDER THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT IS BALANCE ALREADY BALANCED AGAINST THE NEED TO PROTECT VICTIMS AND WITNESSES. GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION SIXTY TWO FIFTY FOUR F. EXPRESSLY STATES THAT THE NAMES AND ADDRESSES OF VICTIMS AND WITNESSES ARE NOT SUBJECT TO DISCLOSURE WHERE DISCLOSURE WOULD QUOTE. ENDANGER THE SAFETY OF A WITNESS OR OTHER PERSON INVOLVED IN THE INVESTIGATION OR WOULD ENDANGER THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE INVESTIGATION OR RELATED INVESTIGATION. WE THINK THOSE PROTECTIONS AND THE BALANCE THAT THAT STRIKES IS IS APPROPRIATE. WE THINK THAT AB TWENTY THIRTEEN IS UNNECESSARY. VICTIMS AND WITNESSES ARE ALREADY PROTECTED WHEN THEIR SAFETY IS THREATENED. AND WHAT THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THEM TO DO IS IN ANY CASE WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS ANY SUGGESTION THAT THERE WAS SUCH A THREAT. TO. TO KEEP THAT INFORMATION FROM BEING DISCLOSED UPON A PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST AND. I I HAVE NOT AT LEAST HEARD TESTIMONY THAT THAT. PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST ARE BEING USED ITEM IN ORDER FOR. AYE OTHER GANG MEMBERS TO TO GET ACCESS TO THE NAMES AND ADDRESSES OF VICTIMS AND WITNESSES SUCH SO AS TO. ENGAGE IN RETALIATION AGAINST. TOM. WE BELIEVE THE PROSECUTION OF GANG CRIMES AS OF OTHER CRIMES NEEDS PUBLIC OVERSIGHT AND WE ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE SO THAT INFORMATION ABOUT THESE PROSECUTIONS IS NOT POINTLESSLY WITH HELD FROM PUBLIC VIEW. THANK YOU FOR ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MISTER QUIRK YA I THINK THIS IS A NECESSARY BUILT PROTECT PEOPLE'S LIVES IN SURE. PROSECUTION AND. AGAIN. I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE BILL AND. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE CAN DO TO. TO GET RID OF CRIMES IS TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO TESTIFY. AND IT IS THE CERTAINTY OF. SOMEONE BEING FOUND OUT CONVICTED FOR CRIME THIS THE WAY TO PREVENT THEM. AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS. FOSTER STATS SO I'LL BE VOTING FOR YOUR BILL THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. YOU MAY CLOSE MOST CUNNINGHAM I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU AN DOT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE. ON ON THE AMENDMENTS I THINK IT. IS THE LEAST GOT ME TO WHERE I'M. RECOMMENDING THAT I ENJOYED AYE RECOMMENDATION. OF. IT IN CONTINUE TO TO TO LISTEN TO TO OTHERS WHO. WHO HAVE CONCERNS AND AS YOU MOVE FORWARD IF YOU CAN FIND ANY WAY TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS PLEASE SO? I KNOW YOU WELL. SURE THAT YOU'LL LISTEN TO THEM SO. TO GET THE MOTION. A MOTION SECOND. SELECT AB TWENTY THIRTEEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER AYE JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY. LACKEY I CARILLO. CARILLO AYE GONZALEZ FLETCHER. KILEY. KILEY AYE QUIRK. QUIRK AYE SAN DIEGO. THE MEASURE PASSES. RELATIONS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR FOR TESTIFIED. TO GALLAGHER. TWENTY TWO NINETY. ITEM NUMBER TEN. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASURE. TO BE IN YOUR COMMITTEE. AT THIS MORNING AND SO TODAY I AM PROUD TO PRESENT. AB TWO TWO NINE ZERO. WHICH WOULD EXPAND POST CONVICTION RESTRAINING ORDERS. TO PROTECT ALL WITNESSES A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHO IN MANY CASES OUR CHILDREN. VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN THEIR IMMEDIATE. FAMILY MEMBERS OFTEN NEED GREATER PROTECTION POST CONVICTION. THAN THEY DO PRE CONVICTION UNDER CURRENT LAW. THE COURT THE COURT MAY ISSUE A POST CONVICTION RESTRAINING ORDER. PROTECTING THE VICTIM THEMSELVES AND A PERCIPIENT WITNESS. THOSE WHO HAVE WITNESSED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND HAVE BEEN CALLED UPON. TO TESTIFY. HOWEVER THE COURT RIGHT NOW AS POWERLESS TO ISSUE A POST CONVICTION RESTRAINING ORDER. PROTECTING A WITNESS OF THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. INCIDENT WHO DID NOT TESTIFY IN COURT. UNLESS THEY CAN PROVE THAT THEY'RE IN DANGER AND IN MANY CASES THESE ARE CHILDREN. A EVEN IF THE DEFENDANT IS NOT PHYSICALLY ABUSED A MINOR IN THE PAST OR IF THE MINOR DID NOT TESTIFY AGAINST THE DEFENDANT. THE MINOR WHO WITNESSED THESE AXES STILL. IN IMMINENT PHYSICAL% DANGER AB TWENTY TWO NINETY WOULD EXPAND THE IMPORTANT PROTECTION OF POST CONVICTION RESTRAINING ORDERS. TO INCLUDE ALL WITNESSES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE NOT JUST PERCIPIENT WITNESSES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND ASK FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AT US FOR AYE VOTE I DON'T HAVE WITH ME A WITH THIS. SORRY OF. NOT A WITNESS BUT THE. SUPPORTER OF THE BILL ORDER LARRY DOYLE. OKAY IF. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THIS COMMITTEE PASSED IN THE LEGISLATURE EVENTUALLY ENACTED AB EIGHTEEN FIFTY. WHICH FILLED A GAP. WITH REGARD TO PROTECTIVE CRIMINAL PROTECTIVE ORDERS. PREVIOUSLY YOU KNOW IT THIS IS PRE CONVICTION PROTECTIVE ORDERS. PREVIOUSLY YOU COULD ONLY. APPLY THOSE PROTECTIVE ORDERS TO THE VICTIMS OR YOU COULD DO PERCIPIENT WITNESSES BUT. YOU COULD NOT DO WITNESSES EVEN THOSE WHO ACTUALLY WITNESSED THE CRIME UNLESS THEY ACTUALLY TESTIFIED. WHICH LEFT VULNERABLE MOSTLY YOUNG CHILDREN WHO WEREN'T ABLE TO. YOU COULDN'T PUT IN THERE THE SITUATION BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T TESTIFY COMPETENTLY OR YOU DIDN'T WANT TO PUT THEM THROUGH THE TRAUMA OF TESTIFY. AND SO WE EXPANDED THE DEFINITION OF WITNESS TO INCLUDE. THESE YOUNG CHILDREN BASICALLY THAT'S OF THAT WAS THE TARGET. DEMOGRAPHIC WHO WE WERE LOOKING TO PROTECT. WE DIDN'T DO THAT HOWEVER AT THE TIME FOR POST CONVICTION. ORDERS THAT'S WHAT AB TWENTY TWO NINETY DOES IT TAKES THE SAME. CONCEPT OF WITNESSES THE YOUNG CHILDREN AND ALLOWS THEM TO BE PROTECTED IT BY EXPANDING THE OF PROTECTIVE ORDERS THAT ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE NOW FOR THE. OF VICTIMS AND FOR PERCIPIENT WITNESSES UNDER ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW'S BILL FOR LAST YEAR. JUST TRYING TO FILL IN SOME OF THE BLANKS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE AN ANOMALOUS SITUATION WHERE. YOU CAN PROTECT ANYBODY EXCEPT THE KIDS WHO MAY HAVE SEEN THE WITH THE USE. OF BUT COULD NOT BE. COULD NOT TESTIFY IN THE EARLIER SITUATION. WE ALSO LAST YEAR WHEN WE WERE WORKING ON THIS BILL. ORDER IS SIMILAR BILL. WEEK GOV ADDED A MEANS WHEREBY YOU CAN GUARANTEE THAT THEY. DEFENDANT IN A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE COULD UP GET OF. GO RANGE FOR. DOES SEEK CUSTODY OR VISITATION. SO THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND. IF ANYBODY HAS ANY QUESTIONS HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY BUT WE HOPE YOU WILL VOTE YES ON THE BILL. THANK YOU ARE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. KATHY SURE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. THIS SESSION WE'RE SEEING BILL AFTER BILL THAT IT TRIES TO. THAT ASKED TO EXPAND OUT SPAM THE COURT'S POWER TO ISSUE POST CONVICTION RESTRAINING ORDERS TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE IT THIS IS AN EXPANSION BEYOND THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF OF WHAT THOSE RESTRAINING ORDERS WE'RE MEANT TO DO WHICH WAS TO PROTECT. VICTIMS IN VERY SPECIFIC KINDS OF CASES ARM. AFTER I'D DEFENDANT WAS RELEASED FROM CUSTODY. WHERE THERE WAS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THAT THAT PARTICULAR VICTIM? MIGHT SUFFER FURTHER HARM IT AT THE THE HANDS OF THE DEFENDANT. WE'RE SEEING THIS EXPANSION. AT THE TO A KIND OF. EXTENSION OF CONTROL OF THE COMMUNAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WHERE THERE'S NOT THAT SAME TYPE OF VERY SPECIFIC THREAT. ON TO BE VERY CLEAR THE THESE ORDERS KEEP DEFENDANTS UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM FOR A PERIOD THAT CAN BE FAR LONGER THAN THE PERIOD OF THE SENTENCE OR EVEN. FROM WHEN THEY'RE ON ON PAROLE OR PROBATION FOR UP TO TEN YEARS IT CAN MAKE IT THAT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TO RE INTEGRATE INTO THE COMMUNITY AFTER RELEASE. AS WHEN THE TERMS OF THE ORDER MAKE IT SO THAT THE PERSON CANNOT GO BACK TO THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD OR. TO A FAMILY HOME. WHERE ARE THE OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS OTHER THAN THE VICTIM UP MIGHT BE ABLE TO? PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THAT PERSON'S REINTEGRATION. WE CERTAINLY AGREE THAT CHILDREN WHO WITNESS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DESERVE PROTECTION AND WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA LAW ALREADY PROVIDES FOR THAT PROTECTION IN THE APPROPRIATE MANNER. THROUGH THE FAMILY CODE PROVISIONS FOR ISSUANCE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROTECTIVE ORDERS. THOSE ORDERS CAN INCLUDE ORDERS TO PROTECT CHILDREN OR OTHER HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS WHO ARE WITNESSES TO ABUSE. THE PROVISIONS UNLIKE THE PROVISIONS PROPOSED IN THIS BILL RECOGNIZE THAT THE PERSON WHO IS SUBJECT TO SUCH AN ORDER MAY WELL BE THE PARENT OF THE CHILDREN INVOLVED. IT IS TO SAY THE LEAST A DIFFICULT SITUATION. ONE WHERE THE COURT NEEDS TO BALANCE THE NUMBER OF COMPETING INTERESTS. NEEDS TO HAVE TOOLS AT THEIR DISPOSAL BEYOND. SIMPLY TELLING THE. THE INDIVIDUAL TO BE RESTRAINED THAT THEY ARE RESTRAINED BUT FOR EXAMPLE IN FAMILY COURT DATE THERE ARE ORDERS TO PROVIDE FOR A SUPERVISED VISITATION IN SOME CASES WHERE THE PERSON IS OTHERWISE RESTRAINED FROM SEEING THOSE CHILDREN. WE THINK THAT FAMILY COURTS HAVE THE EXPERTISE. THAT IS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THIS KIND OF DIFFICULT BALANCING IN A WAY THAT CRIMINAL COURT SIMPLY DO NOT. AND WE OUT STATE THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD NOT ASK THE CRIMINAL COURTS TO DO THE JOB THAT THE FAMILY COURTS ARE ALREADY DOING. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NOVEL. THANK YOU OR ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ARE NAY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THE QUIRK. UP SO MISTER DOYLE ERA REPRESENTING TAKE OUR ASSOCIATIONS ZACHAREK CONVERTS A CALIFORNIA MURATSUCHI YES. SO UNDER CURRENT LAW. THEY CAN FIT THE JUDGES CAN ISSUE A RESTRAINING ORDER IS AN A IS SET THAT'S CORRECT AND UNDER THIS LAW. IT WOULD STILL BE OPTIONAL. FOR THE JUDGES TO ISSUE A RESTRAINING ORDER. YOU'RE SIMPLY. ALLOWING THAT RESTRAINING ORDER TO TO. TO ALSO. AFFECT A TRIAL. BUT AGAIN THAT IS THAT'S AT THE JUDGE'S DISCRETION OF I GOT THAT RIGHT YES YOU'RE CORRECT. SO THIS IS ALL WITH THE JUDGE'S DISCRETION. SO FOR THE ACLU Y. AND VOTED AGAINST SOME OF THESE LAWS WHICH TO EXPAND THAT PROHIBITION. BUT IN THIS CASE IF A JUDGE SHE SITS NECESSARY TO PROTECT CHILD I'VE GOT TO BELIEVE THAT THAT'S BECAUSE HE'S ALSO ISSUE WE WANT TO PROTECT MOTHER. SO I DON'T THINK THAT THIS ADDS A. PARTICULARLY ONEROUS. REQUIREMENT IN TERMS OF SOMEONE STAYING AWAY. DO YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW ON THAT. WELL AGAIN I WOULD RAISE THE SITUATION WHERE FOR ABOUT FIRST I I WOULD SAY IN MANY OF THOSE THOSE CASES THE RESTRAINING ORDER STAYING THE STAY AWAY FROM THE MOTHER WHO NAM WOULD ALSO. AS A MATTER OF PRACTICE PROTECT THE CHILDREN. THE CASES WHERE THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE TRUE I THINK ARE THE ONES WHERE THOSE CHILDREN ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE. THE PERSON WHO WHO IS THE DEFENDANT. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE I THINK THAT A FAMILY COURT HAS OF. BETTER ABILITY TO. ADDRESS ALL OF ALL OF THE INTERESTS IN THE SITUATION AND. AND CRAFT IN ORDER THAT MANY. RESTRICT THE PERSON FROM CONTACT WITH THOSE CHILDREN MOST WHILE STILL ALLOWING FOR EXAMPLE VISITATION. BECAUSE. THAT PERSON HAS AN INTEREST IN MAINTAINING A RELATIONSHIP WITH WITH HIS OR HER CHILDREN. SO I IF I UNDERSTAND THIS THEN MISTER DOYLE. THIS WOULD TRANSFERRED THAT RESPONSIBILITY. AWAY WHO WHO HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE REALLY RAINING ORDER FOR THE MOTHER. IS THAT IN FAMILY COURT OR IN CRIMINAL COURT. WELL THE THE ORIGINAL PROTECTIVE ORDER COMES OUT OF THE CRIMINAL COURT MUSIC CRIMINAL GETS A PROTECTIVE ORDER WHICH IT WE ARE. PROPOSING IS EXPANDED HE CAN BE CAN BE EXPANDED UNDER. APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES OF YEAH AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COURT. TO INCLUDE THE. ESSENTIALLY THE CHILDREN AND VERY OFTEN THE CHILDREN OF THE MARRIAGE OR THE RELATIONSHIP. BUT A WHAT DID THE BILL PROVIDE SPECIFICALLY THAT YOU DO HAVE. A SITUATION WHERE YOU CAN EITHER AT THE TIME OF THE ISSUANCE OF THE ORDER. HE THEY'VE. TAKEN A. AND PROVIDE FOR. THE FAMILY COURT TO MAKE CONSIDERATION. DOWNSTREAM OR AT THAT TIME FOR APPROPRIATE. VISITATION OR CUSTODY ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDING SUPERVISED VISITATION IF THAT'S APPROPRIATE. OF WHERE WERE AND THEY ARE PREPARED PASSING IT ALONG TO THE FAMILY COURT ORDER CAN HAPPEN. FARTHER DOWN THE LINE BUT CANNOT HAPPEN EX PARTE. IT WOULD HAVE TO BE HAPPENED BE HAPPEN AND NOTICED HEARING. YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE BE SURE THAT THE PARENTS. OR THAT THE MOTHER THE GUARDIANS OF THE CHILD ARE ENGAGED AND THAT THE PROSECUTOR FROM THE INITIAL CASE WHO IS AWARE OF THE EXTENT OF THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. IS ALSO NOTIFIED AND IS ALSO BEING ABLE TO BE BROUGHT INTO THE SITUATION SO THAT WE ARE GUARANTEED THAT THE INTERESTS OF THE CHILD ARE GOING TO BE PART FULLY PROTECTED UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. SO THE FAMILY COURT COULD STILL MAKE ASSIST DECISION TO ALLOW. SUPERVISED. OKAY. THEN I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. YOU MAKE. ME CLOSER TO GALLAGHER AYE DISASTER AYE VOTE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. AND UP AND THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION OF MISTER QUIRK OF. BECAUSE IT SEEMED LIKE OF JURISDICTIONAL. AND AND AND I DO BELIEVE FAMILY COURT. MAY HAVE MORE EXPERTISE MAY HAVE LOVED A BETTER UNDERSTANDING IN. AND MAY EVEN BE A LITTLE SENSITIVE TO FAMILY SITUATIONS FUND GLAD THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES IF THERE'S. WAY TO. TO PUT SOME VERBIAGE IN NEAR SO THAT THE FAMILY COURT CAN BE INVOLVED. BY WHICH. I WOULD SUGGEST AS YOU MOVE FORWARD OF TO LOOK IN THAT INSULAR CHAIRED YEAR ENJOYING AYE RECOMMENDATION.

KILEY AYE QUIRK. QUIRK AYE SANTIAGO. THE MEASURE PASSED JUST AS A POINT OF CLARIFICATION. THE BILL YOU JUST MOVE WAS AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTEEN. THE NARCOTICS REGISTRATION OF. AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTEEN WOULD DELETE THE CURRENT REGISTRATION REQUIREMENT FOR A PUBLIC DEFENDER FROM THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE. EVERY CAR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY DESTROYED ON A COMICS OFFENDER REGISTRATION RECORDS AS THEY ARE CURRENTLY ON FILE. THIS BILL WAS BROUGHT TO ME BY THE CONFERENCE OF CALIFORNIA BAR ASSOCIATION HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN AFTER MY ANY QUESTIONS. AGAIN IS LARRY DOYLE. MEMBERS ARE RESPECT LAST WE AYE VOTE. THANK YOU OF MISTER CHAIR. MRS OF MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE A LARGE OIL ON BEHALF OF THE CONVERTS CALIFORNIA BAR ASSOCIATIONS. THE PRINCIPAL THING THAT AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTEEN DOES IS ELIMINATES REQUIREMENT OF THE CREATION NARCOTICS REGISTRY BECAUSE. QUITE FRANKLY IT. IT IS A REQUIREMENT THAT DOESN'T REALLY BENEFIT ANYBODY. IT IS A REQUIREMENT THAT. SPEND TAKES SO UNLIKELY THE CITY OF. THOSE SOCKS RIGID SEX OFFENDER REGISTRATION. A PROCESS THERE IS NO WEBSITE OR ANYTHING ELSE WERE YOU LOOKING FOR NOCKARD EX OFFENDERS. IT IS. A CASE WHERE OFFENDERS ARE FIRST TO REGISTER WHICH TAKES THEIR TIME IT TAKES A TIME OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. WHICH ALREADY KNOWS THE INFORMATION THAT'S THERE. IT'S KIND OF LIKE. NOBODY REALLY CARES NOBODY BENEFITS WE SHOULD USE THE GA RESOURCES TO DO. MORE IMPORTANT THINGS. GO GIVES MORE IMPORTANT CRIMES. A. THERE WERE SOME AMENDMENTS THAT I BELIEVE THERE WERE. OKAY OKAY. WHERE AND WHAT IF? IF I WAS ABLE TO TAKE SOME AMENDMENTS UP TAKEN. CARE. I'M NOT IT WASN'T SURE OF IT ANYWAY. OKAY. LET'S GO THERE THERE IS A PROVISION OF THE BILL THAT WAS IT ISSUE WAS BROUGHT UP BY THE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION. REGARDING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND THE. WHO HAVING TO DO WITH TEACHERS? CURRENTLY UNDER EXISTING LAW THE SHERIFFS ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT. TO OF THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT MONEY. TEACHER IS ARRESTED. THERE ARE CURRENTLY UNDER CURRENT LAW THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS ALSO REQUIRED TO BAKE A SIMILAR REPORT. SO THERE'S REALLY NOT A LOT OF BENEFIT TO THAT ADDITIONAL. REQUIREMENT TO AND THE IDEA OF REPORTING. ON THE AT A. THE FACT OF AN ARREST. IS THERE. NO. CAN A PRE JUDGMENT ON THE TEACHER BECAUSE ARREST DOES NOT MEAN CONVICTION DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE WAS. OF PROBABLE CAUSE EVEN NECESSARILY IT JUST SIMPLY MEANS THAT SOMEBODY WAS ARRESTED FOR A CRIME. AND YOU COULD HAVE A VERY DELETERIOUS EFFECT ON A TEACHER'S CAREER FOR NO GOOD PURPOSE SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WHAT WE'RE DOING I BELIEVE WITH THE AMENDMENTS AS THEY WERE PRESENTED TO ME. IS TO REMOVE THAT REQUIREMENT THE BILL LEAVE IT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO DO WHAT. NEEDS TO BE DONE TO MAKE SURE THAT. OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WHERE THAT. OR THAT THE TEACHERS ARE AWARE. OR THE THE OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE AWARE OF THAT THEIR PROBLEMS WITH THE TEACHERS AND. ACT IT THERE ARE NO AMENDMENTS BUT WE ARE GOING TO WORK WITH THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT TO MAKE SURE THIS CLARIFICATION. SO WE DON'T HAVE REDUNDANCY THANK IT IS REPORTED. IS REPORTED DOJ AND WOOD WHERE WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE WE WORK TO CHERISH TOOK TO ENSURE THAT ITS REPORT IT SOMEWHERE. AND THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE ONUS ON BOTH OF THEM AT THE SAME TIME. MY APOLOGIES FOR THE COMMITTEE. I'M STILL CONFUSED LET'S LET'S MOVE FORWARD. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. YET MEDI HIRED CALIFORNIA'S HILLARY'S ADVOCACY IN SUPPORT. CATHY SURE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. REBEKAH GONZALEZ NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IN SUPPORT. GAVE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OKAY. ABOUT COMMITTEE MEMBERS SO YEAH IT'S SO THAT THERE'S NOT ANY CONFUSION. THE INTENTION OF THE BILL IS THAT THERE'D STILL BE REPORT IF TEACHERS ARRESTED FOR DRUGS. ARE IN THAT WOULD COME FROM DOJ IS THAT CORRECT. CRAP QUE. ON. I SAY THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME HAVING HAD A DAUGHTER. WHO WAS TAUGHT BY SOMEONE WITH A DRUG PROBLEM WAS NEVER SOLVED EVENTUALLY? WAS BEATEN TO THE POINT WHERE HE BECAME A. I HAD TO INDICATE WHEN INTO A VEGETATIVE STATE SO FOR BOTH HIM AND MY DAUGHTER IT WAS JUST A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. AND I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT TO A SCHOOL DISTRICTS BE INFORMED AND SINCE THE BILL PRESERVES THAT I'LL BE VOTING AYE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS I DO HAVE A COMMENT BECAUSE THIS IS VERY CRITICAL PART OF THIS BILL FOR ME AS WELL ARMENIA. GIVING SCHOOL DISTRICTS NOTIFICATION IS VERY VERY CRITICAL TO ME. BECAUSE WE NEED TO PROTECT STUDENTS WE JUST REALLY THAT THAT'S A VERY VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT TO ME. AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT THIS AMENDMENT. IS. IF JUDGE ORDERS NO AMENDMENT HERE. THE LEFT TO GO IN YOUR WORD. IT WILL RESOLVE THAT IN A MEANINGFUL WAY AND. IT NEEDS TO BE. VERY. TIMELY NOTIFICATION. AS THAT IS WHAT I WOULD ASK FOR. OKAY. I JUST READ IT DOES.

AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY TO WOULD SURE THAT FOR THE PURPOSE OF PAINT INFRACTION FIND THE VALUE OF ONE HOUR OF COMMUNITY SERVICE IS AT LEAST DOUBLED. THE CALIFORNIA MINIMUM WAGE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES CALIFORNIA FEES AND FINES ARE AMONG THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION. AS AN EXAMPLE THE BASELINE FOR RED LIGHT VIOLATIONS A HUNDRED DOLLARS BUT AFTER PENALTIES AND ASSESSMENT THE TOTAL AMOUNT DUE IS FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY DOLLARS. THESE LARGE FINE AMOUNTS OR BURDENSOME FOR LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS AND DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT PEOPLE OF COLOR. COURTS DO HAVE THE DISCRETION TO SENTENCE INDIVIDUAL TO COMMUNITY SERVICE IF THE TOTAL FINE AMOUNT WOULD CAUSE A FINANCIAL HARDSHIP. THE CALIFORNIA DOES NOT HAVE A CONSISTENT MINIMUM RATE FOR CONVERTING COMMUNITY SERVICE HOURS. AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY TWO WOULD REVENUE THIS BY PROVIDING A UNIFORM RATE FOR CONVERTING INFRACTION FINDS INTO COMMUNITY SERVICE HOURS SPECIFICALLY TO CONVERSION RATE WOULD BE EQUAL TO NO LESS THAN DOUBLE THE MINIMUM WAGE. WAGE RATE FOR BUSINESSES WITH FEWER THAN TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES. THIS IS CONSISTENT WOULD A RECOMMENDATION FROM THE DISH ó COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA. IN HERE WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY AS A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL MEMBERS OUR RESPECT LAST FREE AYE VOTE. MOVED TO BELL. AND THE LIVING BOMB JUDICIAL COUNCIL I JUST WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER VERY MUCH FOR CARRYING THIS BILL WE'RE PLEASED TO SPONSOR IT AS HE SAID OUR FEES AND FINES ARE HIGH IN CALIFORNIA COURTS ALREADY ARE OFFERING. COMMUNITY SERVICE TO PEOPLE FOR WHOM IT IS. IMPOSSIBLE TO PAVE THE DOLLARS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FINES AND FEES AND THIS JUST CREATES A REASONABLE RATE AT WHICH THEIR COMMUNITY SERVICE HOURS SHALL BE VALUED. YOU. OKAY ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. COMMITTEE MEMBERS. COMMENTS. SO WHY DO WE CHOOSE TWENTY TWO AYE TWICE THE MINIMUM WAGE IS THE APPROPRIATE. YOU KNOW AMOUNT OF REIMBURSEMENT. SO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL EXPLORED THAT VERY ISSUE AND IT WE LOOKED AT A NUMBER OF ALTERNATIVES WE THOUGHT OF CREATING A STANDARD RATE JUST A DOLLAR AMOUNT AND WE DECIDED THAT'S NOT REASONABLE BECAUSE ECONOMIES CHANGE AND SO CREATING A DOLLAR AMOUNT STATUTES SEEMED A LITTLE BIT. INFLEXIBLE WE THOUGHT ABOUT JUST THE MINIMUM WAGE BUT WE FELT THAT WHEN SOMEBODY IS GIVING UP A PERHAPS A DAY OF WORK. PERHAPS THEY'RE MAKING MORE THAN THE MINIMUM WAGE TO ONE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE VALUE FOR THEIR TIME GIVING TO SOCIETY IS REASONABLE WE DIDN'T WANT THEM TO BE. PAYING LESS THAN SOMEBODY WOULD BE PAYING IN FINES SO WE TRIED TO CREATE A MIDDLE GROUND THAT EQUATED THE VALUE OF THEIR TIME TO THE AMOUNT THAT THEY WOULD BE PAYING IN DOLLARS.

MUCH OF THE EVIDENCE GATHERED BY THE SPECIAL SERVICES UNIT AND THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS IS OBTAINED WHILE UNDERCOVER OR HAPPENSTANCE. BUT WHEN SUBMITTED TO LOCAL DISTRIBUTARY. ISN'T AFTER IS THE AFTER IS AFTER THE FACT AND NOT PERMISSIBLE AS LEGAL EVIDENCE BECAUSE NEITHER OF THE SWORN PEACE OFFICERS ARE INCLUDED IN PENAL CODES. SIX THREE THREE MANY TIMES EVIDENCE IS PRESENTED IS OFFICERS WHILE PERFORMING THEIR DUTIES ARE JUST HAPPEN TO BE REVEALED ACCIDENTALLY WITHOUT PRE PLANNING. SPECIAL SERVICES UNIT AND THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS ARE RESTRICTED FROM USING THIS EVIDENCE BECAUSE THEY NEED A LOCAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S WARRANT PRIOR TO GAMING BE EVIDENCE. THIS PROBLEM IS WHY PEACE OFFICER AGENCIES ARE LISTED IN PENAL CODE SIX THREE THREE INCH AND WHY SF YOU AND ADDED. OUT WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY IS MICHAEL BRODY A FIELD OFFICER WITH SS YOU AND FORD CANOE. A OF THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONS SUPERVISORS ORGANIZATIONS MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IBM. OF GOOD AFTERNOON OF MY NAME'S FORD CANET I'M A MINISTRY TO THE SYSTEM FOR THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL SUPERVISORS ORGANIZATION. FOR MANY YEARS. SS YOU AND ó I A WHICH OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS AND SPECIAL SERVICE UNIT. WORKED UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF SIX THIRTY THREE BECAUSE THEY WORK WITH. OTHER POLICE AGENCIES TO BUILD THEIR CRIMINAL CASES. BUT AFTER. AB ONE OH NINE AND. PROP FORTY SEVEN. THE POLICE HAD THE SHERIFF'S. HAD A LOT MORE PUT ON THEIR PLATE. AND THEY DON'T HAVE. THE MANPOWER TO ASSIST AS A FEW ORAL A IN BUILDING THEIR CASES. QUITE OFTEN EVERYDAY SOMETIMES WE STILL DO AND SO THERE'S STILL UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF SIX SIX THREE WITH THE PENAL CODE. BUT. SINCE THAT TIME. ESSAYS YOU WHICH IS AN UNDERCOVER ORGANIZATION WHO WEARS WIRES. WHO OF WIRETAPS UNDER BODY AND ALSO? HAVE. CONFIDENTIAL A NETWORK OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANTS BECAUSE THEY INNER DIPPED BETWEEN PRISON GANGS IN THE STREET GANGS. AND THEY ALSO. UP PURSUE ESCAPEES. BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY BUILD THEIR CASES FROM THE TOP DOWN ALL BY THEMSELVES WITHOUT. THE OTHER PEACE OFFICERS THEY NOW DON'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF BEING UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF SIX SIX THREE THAT. THE IT BETTER THEY NEED TO BE LISTED IN IT. SO THEY DON'T LOSE THE EVIDENCE THAT THEY GARNER. WELL OUT IN THE FIELD. AND. AS FAR AWAY WE OWE A IS TRYING TO PLEASE FIFTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. AND THERE'S BAD APPLES OUT THERE AND ANY ORGANIZATION OF FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE AND THERE'S A LOT OF CRIMINAL ACTS A BRINGING IN. DRUGS INTO THE INSTITUTION WE'VE HAD GANG MEMBERS BECOME PEACE OFFICERS BECAUSE THEY PASSED BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS WITHOUT A MYRIAD OF CRIMES. THAT OF ALL A HAVE TO INVESTIGATE AND IF THEY'RE NOT. IF THEY'RE NOT. WORKING WITH THE LOCAL POLICE THEN THEY'RE NOT UNDER THE SIX SIX THREE ON UMBRELLA AND THEY ALSO NEED TO BE LISTED. TODAY I BROUGHT. AGENT OF MICHAEL BRODY. INDEED HE'S. HAS A TWENTY FIVE YEAR CAREER IN NEVIS UNDERCOVER AGENT FOR SS YOU. GOOD MORNING. COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR LET ME SHARE A LITTLE BIT. I'M A LOT OF PEOPLE REALIZE THAT S. ISSUE IS ACTUALLY ON LAW ENFORCEMENT ARMOR CITY ARE THAT WE ALL WORK INSIDE PRISON WE ACTUALLY WORKED STREET. NOW SWITCHED BACK INTO MY POCKET. AND UP. WE'RE WE'RE THE ONLY PART OF CDC ARE THAT IT'S UNDER A THIRTY POINT TWO FOUR AS A PEACE OFFICER WITH FULL TIME PEACE OFFICER STATUS. IN A MILLION THINGS THAT WE DO WE WE INVESTIGATE COMPLICATED CRIMINAL GANGS. CASES IN USUALLY S. AND A SEEN BY MANY LAW ENFORCEMENT AS THE GANG EXPERTS SO WHEN THEY HAVE A CASE THAT'S. HAS A CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION NEXUS THAT FLOWS OF COMES INTO THE PRISON OR THE PRESENCE. D. S. STAFFED IN INFORMATION AS IT RELATES TO CRIMINAL GANGS ON THE STREETS WE WERE CALLED IN TO INVESTIGATE THAT AND WORK WITH LOCAL PEOPLE LOCAL AGENCIES. IN BUILDING THOSE CASES FOR THEM AND LIKE MISTER CANNOT SAID WE MANY TIMES WHERE THE LEAD CO AGED AND SO WE'RE DOING THE DIRECT FILING. WE ALSO DO X. SCAPES NAM WHEN GUYS X. GAPE WALK AWAY FROM FIRE CAMPS OR PRISONS WE'RE THE ONES IN PURSUIT OF THOSE. AND WHAT. BE COVERED ON SIX THIRTY THREE WHAT IT DOES FOR US IS IT ALLOWS US IN THE COURSE OF OUR INVESTIGATION WHETHER WE WORK UNDERCOVER. WORKING WITH INFORMANTS OR IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR INVESTIGATION IT ALLOWS US TO BE ABLE TO CAPTURE. A SPONTANEOUS STATEMENTS MADE. REGARDING THEM THE CRIMINAL ACTS THAT WERE INVESTIGATING OR OTHER CRIMINAL ACTS THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT SOMEBODY. CONFESSES WITHOUT BEING THAT COVERED UNDER THAT SIX THIRTY THREE WE CANNOT USE THAT AND COR. EVEN THOUGH. IT. WE HAVE THE INFORMATION. SO THE GO BACK AND GET A WARRANT AFTER THAT TO CALL BACK AND TRY TO RE INTERVIEW AND CAN SAY THE SAME STATEMENTS PUTS US AT A HANDICAP.

KATHY SURE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. QUITE SIMPLY WE THINK THE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS PROVIDED UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW AND THE LIMITED EXCEPTIONS FOR SOME BUT NOT ALL TYPES OF PEACE OFFICERS. HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR FIFTY YEARS. AND DON'T SEE THAT THERE'S BEEN A CASE MADE FORTUNES REVISITING THAT DECISION. AT THIS POINT IN TIME ON WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THAT ABI DESERTING IT AS TO THE SPECIFIC WORK FOR PEACE OFFICER. PEACE OFFICERS REQUESTING. TO BE INCLUDED IN THE EXCEPTION IS IS GOING TO LEAD TO. A ONE AND ANOTHER AND AND. RE OPENING THE WHOLE QUESTION OF WHICH PEACE OFFICERS ARE ACCEPTED FOR IT FROM THE EXISTING LAW WE ASK FOR YOUR NOVEL. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ARE YOU OPPOSED TO SIX SIX THREE GENERALLY. ARE THE ABILITY OF POLICE OFFICERS TO REPORT. AS. TO THE COURT. I MEAN IS IT IS SISSACH CONCERN I MEAN I THINK THEY MADE A GREAT CASE THAT THEY'RE LIKE OTHER POLICE OFFICERS WHY SHOULDN'T WE INCLUDE THEM. ARE YOU GENERALLY AGAINST SIX SIX THREE WHICH ALLOWS THIS FOR OTHER POLICE OFFICERS ARE YOU SPIT DO YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC REASON. FOR EXCLUDING THIS GROUP. NO I WOULDN'T SAY WE ARE GENERALLY OPPOSED I I THINK THAT THAT BALANCE THAT WAS STRUCK. DAVID IT. IT EXTENDED THE THE EXCEPTION TO. MOST KINDS OF. PEACE OFFICERS AND AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS BUT BUT THERE ARE MANY KINDS WHO ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE EXCEPTION. YOU KNOW TO OUR KNOWLEDGE IT IT HAS NOT PRESENTED A PROBLEM FOR THOSE AGENCIES AND DOING THEIR WORK. AND AND WE'RE HESITANT TO SEE. THE EXPANSION OF THE EXCEPTION SO THAT THAT THE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS ARE ARE NARROWED. IN TERMS OF OF WHERE THEY APPLY GOT IT SO I'LL BE VOTING AYE ON THE BILL I JUST DON'T SEE A GREAT DEAL OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT LOCAL POLICE TO. IN THEIR TASK FORCES AND WHAT THIS GROUP IS DOING SO HOT IF I SAW A DIFFERENCE OF SOME TYPE. AND YOU COULD TELL ME WHAT THAT IS I. MIGHT CONSIDER VOTING NO BUT RIGHT NOW I'M VOTING AYE. LETS YOU CAN THINK OF A GOOD REASON THAT THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT THAN SAY LOCAL POLICE. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. WELL MOTION.
