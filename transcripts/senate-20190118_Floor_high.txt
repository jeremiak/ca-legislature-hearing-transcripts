THANK YOU MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT SAW THIS IS INDEED A RESOLUTION CELEBRATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE TWENTY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF NORTHRIDGE. BUT I DON'T USE THAT TERM IN THE CONTEXT OF CELEBRATION.

WE WOKE UP IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY TO A SIGNIFICANT EARTHQUAKE. THIS EXTRAORDINARY SIXTY THOUSAND HOUSES.

AND IS LUCY JONES SAID YESTERDAY THAT EVENT TO CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE IT STILL WAS A VERY SMALL EARTHQUAKE COMPARED TO WHAT WE CAN OTHERWISE FACE. AND SO THE THE ANY OTHER THING THAT YOU SAID THAT I FOUND QUITE ASTOUNDING. IS THAT THE CHANCE THAT CALIFORNIA WILL EXPERIENCE A SIX POINT SEVEN OR LARGER EARTHQUAKE IN THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS. IS 99%. SO THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHEN WHERE AND HOW BIG NOT THAT IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. SO WE NEED TO BE PREPARED OUR JOB IN GOVERNMENT IN SO MANY RESPECTS IN TERMS OF REPAIRING THE LIVES OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN DEALING WITH ALL THE OTHER CHALLENGES TO BE THERE BE AVAILABLE TO FIGURE IT OUT WE KNOW. THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN LET'S GET AFTER IT AS SOME FAMOUS SON OF THE GOVERNOR SAID FROM NEW YORK. WE HAVE A CENTER ON THIS FLOOR THAT THE LAST FOUR YEARS FROM SAN MATTEO WHO'S BEEN DILIGENTLY GETTING THE FUNDING FOR EARLY WARNING SYSTEM ELEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE NOTES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THAT GIVE YOU TEN SECONDS. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE EARLY WARNING WHAT'S AT TEN SECONDS FOR STOPPING ELEVATORS OPENING DOORS FOR FIRES A STATIONS THAT OTHERWISE COULD BE CLOSE TO FIRST RESPONDERS CAN GET OUT. BEING ABLE TO GET OUT OF YOUR HOME AND ALL SORTS SMALL STEP AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE I THINK IN THE COMING YEAR A NUMBER OF OTHER. MEASURES IN THIS LUCY JONES SAID YESTERDAY. THE EARTHQUAKE IS INEVITABLE. BUT THE DISASTER IS NOT. AND THAT IS UP TO US THAT IS UP TO US IN TERMS OF OUR ROLE IN GOVERNMENT SO I STAND HERE TODAY. REALLY NOT SO MUCH IN CELEBRATION OF THE ANNIVERSARY BUT A REMEMBRANCE CALL THE ACTION. FOR ALL OF US TO GET AFTER IT. I ASKED RIVAL [inaudible] MAJORITY LEADER. CENTER STERN AND THEN SENATOR ALLEN SENATOR STERN THE FLOOR IS YOURS SIR. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT JUST BRIEFLY RISE JOIN MY COLLEAGUES -- FROM THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY WE SHARE NORTHRIDGE. I DON'T WANT TO BE STANDING HERE A YEAR FROM NOW MORNING. OR TWO YEARS FROM NOW SAYING WHAT WE COULD HAVE DONE I WANT TO FOCUS ON WHAT WE CAN DO NOW. TO GET AHEAD OF THIS -- THE MAGNITUDE IS ALMOST TOO LARGE. TO TO TO IMAGINE AND IT'S A DIFFERENT ANIMAL THAN A FIRE OR FLOOD -- THESE REALLY TO BLINDSIDE YOU BUT THOSE SECONDS COUNT. WE HAVE NEW TECHNOLOGY COMING ONLINE BUT IT'S ABOUT THE HOUSING STOCK IN LOOKING IT SOFT STORY HOUSING AND ALL THE FAMILIES THAT ARE VULNERABLE ALL THROUGHOUT LOS ANGELES IN.
