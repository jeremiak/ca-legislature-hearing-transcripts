THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I'M HAPPY AND AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WILL HOLD ALL QUESTIONS TILL. ALL THREE PEOPLE HAVE PRESENTED THE NEXT PERSON IS CHASING CONSTANT. TOURISTS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE PANEL SO. A GOOD MORNING CAN- THERE'S A CONSTANT SLUDGE AND OFFICE BEFORE I DIVE INTO THE LIBRARY PROPOSALS I WANTED TO TOUCH ON A THEME THAT YOU'LL HEAR US REITERATE THROUGHOUT THE HEARING TODAY. AND THAT IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SUBMITTED A LOT OF PROPOSALS COVERING MANY DIFFERENT PRIORITIES AND ACROSS MANY DIFFERENT AGENCIES. I MEAN A LOT OF CASES THESE PROPOSALS HAVE VERY LIMITED INFORMATION AND THE LEGISLATURE HAS VERY LITTLE TIME TO ASSESS THEM BASED ON THIS LITTLE INFORMATION. AND THEN EVEN WHERE INFORMATION DOES EXIST FOR THESE PROPOSALS- IT'S OFTEN- PRELIMINARY OR INCOMPLETE. DESPITE THAT A LACK OF INFORMATION WE THINK THERE ARE PROPOSALS WHERE THE LEGISLATURE COULD START MAKING DECISIONS ON THESE PROPOSALS- EITHER THE PROPOSALS HAVE MERITS AND ARE WORTHY OF CONSIDERATION IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. WELL THEY RAISE ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE LEGISLATURE ONE AWAY. OR THE PROPOSALS ARE PROBLEMATIC PROBLEMATIC ENOUGH THAT YOU COULD REJECT THEM WITHOUT- NECESSARILY GETTING MUCH MORE INFORMATION. AND THEN THERE ARE PRPOSALS WHERE- THAT PROPOSALS AND CONCEPTS SEEM REASONABLE BUT THERE IS SOME INFORMATION LACKING- AT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD WANT TO GET MORE INFORMATION BEFORE AUTHORIZING- AND IN THIS PARTICULAR- LIBRARY ITEM WE THINK THAT YOU SEE OLD ALL OF THESE KINDS OF PROPOSALS HERE. I JUST WALK THROUGH A FEW OF THE MAJOR ONES. ARE MY DIRECTOR TENSION TO THE VERY FIRST BULLET ON LIBRARY INFRASTRUCTURE ON PAGE TWO OF YOUR AGENDA. ON A LIBRARIAN FOR STRUCTURE IS SOMETHING THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS TALKED ABOUT IN PREVIOUS HEARINGS IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A- CONSIDERATION- FOR THE SENATE'S BUDGET. SO THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO PURSUE THE WE THINK THEY HAVE GOVERNORS MAY REVISION PROPOSAL- PROVIDES A POTENTIALLY GOOD STARTING POINT TO WORK FROM. THAT SAID WE DO HAVE SOME RECOMMENDED MODIFICATIONS TO THIS IF THAT'S AN THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO PURSUE. FOR EXAMPLE WE RECOMMEND LIMITING THE SCOPE OF THIS- PROPOSAL TO- CAPITAL OUTLAY AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ANOTHER FACILITY RATED RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE. AS YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE RELATED PROPOSALS- FOCUSED ON BROADBAND ACCESS AND WE'D ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE THAT- THERE'S NO DUPLICATION AMONG ITS DIFFERENT GRANT PROGRAMS. WELL I THINK THERE ARE SOME PROPOSALS HERE THAT YOU COULD CONSIDER REJECTING- FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU LOOK UNDER THAT SUB HEADING EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING. THE FIRST TWO PROPOSALS ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE IN AN ONLINE TUTORING. OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THESE ARE SUPPORTING ACTIVITIES THAT- SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ALREADY COVER THE STATE PROVIDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR THESE PURPOSES- WE DON'T SEE THE RATIONALE IN CREATING A SEPARATE PROGRAMS FOCUSED- ON LIBRARIES- LARGELY DUPLICATING THE SERVICES WE RECOMMEND YOU REJECT THESE ONES. AND THEN FINALLY WE THINK THERE ARE PROPOSALS THAT- SEEM- POTENTIALLY REASONABLE CONCEPT THERE'S JUST- NOT A LOT OF INFORMATION ON THEM AT THIS TIME. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF US SMALLER INITIATIVES OR WE THINK THIS IS THE CASE. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE A LOT OF THESE PROPOSALS- AT POSITION OF AUTHORITY TO THE STATE LIBRARY BUT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT PROVIDED MORE DETAILED WORKLOAD ANALYSES ON THESE POSITIONS. ARE DESCRIBING- THEIR ACTIVITIES AND ALSO WALKING THROUGH WHAT ALTERNATIVES WERE CONSIDERED IT FOR EXAMPLE- WHY EXISTING STAFF CANNOT ABSORB THESE ACTIVITIES WE RECOMMEND- GETTING MORE INFORMATION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON THESE PROPOSALS BEFORE AUTHORIZING FUNDS FOR THEM. NOW I HAVE A FULL AGENDA TODAY SOMEWHAT FOR THE SAKE OF TIME I'LL LEAVE MY JUST GOT MY COMMENTS THERE. BUT HAPPY TO EXPAND ON ANY OF THESE DURING YOUR DAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO GREG LUCAS TO STATE WHAT BURNS. I THANK SENATOR. WELL WE'RE ALWAYS HAPPY TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION. ANALYSTS IF THAT HELPS THEM IN THEIR ASSESSMENT- I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT- ANY ITEMS YOU AND THE COMMITTEE HAVE- QUESTIONS ABOUT QUESTIONS ABOUT I MEAN I THINK JENNA J. SOME SORT OF LAID OUT THE- IDMS IN THE GENERAL. COURAGE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I HAVE ONE QUESTION AND I AM NOT SURE MAYBE THE STATE LIBRARIAN IS THE BEST TO TAKE A SHOT AT IT. ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND BROADBAND PROPOSALS THAT- BARB- INCLUDED HERE AND WHAT WILL THE PROCESS BE TO DECIDE- WHO MOST HAS NEED AND HOW ARE YOU OLD SORT OF DISTRIBUTE THIS LIMITED AMOUNT OF MONEY. HELLO WHAT'S WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS IF THIS IS LEFT IN THE BUDGET EXACTLY THE WAY THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED. SO GREAT BREAKING THE TWO ITEMS RIGHT SO THAT THERE'S A THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR. GRANT PROGRAM INVOLVING BROADBAND FOCUSING ON THE FACILITY'S FIRST THE INTENT OF THE ADMINISTRATION HAS TO GIVE UP THAT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS- ON ON AN EQUITY BASIS WITH A PROGRAMS I MEAN WE USE A VARIETY OF DETERMINERS BUT A KEY YARDSTICK. MAYBE I'M OUT OF PER CAPITA SPENDING IN A JURISDICTION- FOR LIBRARIES SO. TO SO THAT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS RIGHT SO WHAT. EXCUSE ME ON STUMBLING OVER THIS BUT. SO THE LEAST RESOURCE LIBRARIES RIGHT WOULD BE GET FIRST CALL ON THAT MONEY AND THAT'S PRIMARILY SMALL AND RURAL LIBRARY JURISDICTIONS AND POCKETS OF URBAN AREAS WITH HIGH AND LOW INCOME- AND LIKE POPULATIONS AND IF THERE pRESOURCE THEN YOU'RE REQUIRING A 0% MATCH IS THAT GOINGTO BE SOMETHING THAT SCREAMS PEOPLE OUT BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO GO TO THE WASTE RESOURCE AND THEN THEY DON'T HAVE THE 50% MATCH. WELL WELL. I MEAN. YEAH THAT'S THE CATCH TWENTY TWO RIGHT I MEAN THE LEAST RESOURCE PEOPLE HAVE THE LEAST ABILITY. TO MAKE THE MATCHING REQUIREMENTS HOWEVER I MEAN THIS PROPOSAL HAS- WALKING GIVES US THE ABILITY. TO REDUCE RIGHT THE AMOUNT OF- MATCHING FUNDS THAT SHOULD BE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE GRANT PROGRAM. AND THEN ONE OTHER QUESTION I'M SORRY TO GO INTO THE WEEDS. A LOT OF TIMES WHEN THEY'RE THAT SMALL AND THEY DON'T HAVE MUCH CAPACITY THEY DON'T HAVE EXTENSIVE CAPACITY TO COMPLETE APPLICATIONS IS THERE GOING TO BE A WAVE THAT. THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE SCREENED OUT OF THIS BY ANY PROBLEM IN THE BUILDING TO DO THAT. UP TO TWO YEARS AGO- WE RECEIVED A NUMBER OF- MEMBERS REQUEST INVOLVING LIBRARY PROJECTS AND SO WE CREATED A APPLICATION PROCESS AND REPORTING PROCESS TO HANDLE THOSE MAPS- WE TRIED TO MAKE IT AS EASY TO COMPLY WITH THAT AS POSSIBLE WHILE MAINTAINING THE- YOU KNOW THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE TO COLLECT HER I THINK IT WOULD BE SIMILAR. I MEAN TO BE. IF YOU KNOW THE PROCESS THAT WE WENT THROUGH WITH SANTA CRUZ COUNTY ON THE FELTON LIBRARY- I MEAN IT'S IT WOULD BE IN THE WAY WE'RE LOOKING AT IT NOW IT WOULD BE COMPARABLE TO THAT ROOM- SORRY TO DRAW ON A- ASKED INCARNATION BUT WHEN I WAS RESOURCES SECRETARY AND WE FACED THIS. WE WOULD HAVE PEOPLE DO LETTERS OF INTENT. AND IF THEIR LETTER OF INTENT WHICH WAS VERY BRIEF DEMONSTRATED NEED THEN WE'D WORK WITH THEM ON THE CAPACITY WE WOULDN'T LET THE APPLICATION SCREEN THEM OUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE ALREADY THERE SO- I APPRECIATE. YOUR RESPONSE WHEN WE ASKED THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THAT COULD BE A GREAT DAY THAT COULD BE A GREAT WAY TO FACILITATE JAMAICAN SO KNOCK DOWN SOME BARRIERS SO. GREAT THANK YOU HAPPY TO CHAT OFFLINE ABOUT THAT. DO THE OTHER MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. I DO- CENTRED ROADSHOW BOOK. I'M AND THIS IS FOR THE LIBRARY- I JUST HAVE A QUESTION WITH REGARDS TO THAT THE CONCERNS THAT THE LA- HAD WITH REGARDS TO THE- ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE PROGRAMS AND- K. TWELVE ONLINE HOMEWORK HELP DESK- WITH SCHOOLS ALREADY BEING PROVIDED ARE. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS- FOR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES PROVIDING LOGISTICAL LANGUAGE PROGRAMS. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON ON THEIR REMARKS. I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING SENATOR- THERE'S SO MUCH DIVERSITY IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND FAMILIES AND SO MANY DIFFERENT SITUATIONS THAT BEARS MULTIPLE PATHS TO SUCCESS AND I THINK PART OF GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY IS TO CREATE. AS MANY PATHS SO TO THAT SUCCESS RIGHT THE FACILITATE- YOU KNOW THE DESIRES AND THE GOALS OF% INDIVIDUAL CALIFORNIANS SO THE EXPERIENCE THAT'S GOING ON IN SO THEY'VE BEEN LITERACY PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA LIBRARY SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR. AND SO THIS PROPOSAL ADDS ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE TO ONE OF THE ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED BY THESE LOCAL LITERACY PROGRAMS AND THE REASON THE PROPOSAL IS HERE IS BECAUSE ONE- THE STATE IS SPENDING ABOUT 50% LESS IN ADULT EDUCATION AND WAS. YOU KNOW EIGHT OR NINE YEARS AGO WHEN GOVERNOR BROWN TOOK OFFICE- BEARS FAN. YEAH THE EXPENSE- IF I'VE CALLED G. THERE'S LESS CLASSES AVAILABLE AND ALSO THERE'S PEOPLE WHO DON'T- SIXTY DOES WELL IN A CLASSROOM AND FIRE. AND SO WHAT WE HAVE REPORTED TO US BY. YOUR REPRESENTATIVES OF- ELEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY LIBRARIES AROUND THE STATE IS THAT THERE'S A STRONG DESIRE- BANDS. OF PEOPLE COMING TO THE LIBRARY AND SPEAKING ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE L. AND SO. I MEAN I THINK IT SPEAKS SO WHAT THAT'S I CAN'T REALLY IMPROVE ON THAT AS FOR TUTORING- I MEAN I MEAN THERE'S- THERE THERE'S A VARIETY OF PROPOSALS- ROUNDS AROUND TUTORING I SUPPOSE- I MEAN I HEARD THE GOVERNOR ARTICULATE ONE THAT WAS IN K. THROUGH TWELVE. BUT I THINK AGAIN IT GOES BACK TO. IF WE HAVE A NETWORK OF ELEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY LIBRARIES RIGHT SO WHOSE MISSION IS TO CLOSE THE OPPORTUNITY GAP. AND OVER THE PAST YEAR THAT THEIR PHYSICAL DOORS CLOSE AND MORE PEOPLE HAVE ENTERED THEM ENTERED THROUGH DIGITAL DOORS TO MAKE AVAILABLE TO ANY STUDENT WHO WANTS IT ANYTIME OF THE DAY THEY WANTED. ONLINE TUTORING IN ENGLISH SPANISH AND MANDARIN. FOUR RIGHT AS A PILOT PROJECT RIGHT BUT TO MAKE THAT AVAILABLE FOR. RELATIVELY SPEAKING THIS MODEST AMOUNT OF MONEY- THROUGH EVERY PUBLIC LIBRARY IN THE STATE SEEMS LIKE IT'S A BENEFIT THAT HELPS OTHER. ELEMENTS IN THE PROPOSED MAY BEGIN ONLY IN THE MAY REVISION SUCCEED BETTER. DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION- HE GAVE ME A RATIONALE SO YES THANK YOU- WHEN YOU PASS ON TO SENATOR MAN HOPE WHILE I'VE SEEN MANY QUESTIONS ON STATE LIBRARIES YEAH I HAD A QUESTION- AND THIS IS FOR THE LIBRARY AND ALSO I GUESS FRIENDLY- BUT- I'M INTERESTED IN THE BROADBAND ACCESS GRANTS PROPOSAL. IN A REVISED WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE WAYS IN WHICH THE CORONA VIRUS A PANDEMIC HAS EXPOSED THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN THIS STATE- AND I GUESS I'M JUST NOT I'M NOT KNOWING. YOU KNOW WHAT THE EXISTING ARCHITECTURE LOOKS LIKE WHAT IS THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS GET US AND TO THE LIBRARY DO YOU DO YOU MAYBE YOU COULD COMMENT ON HOW YOU SEE THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES AND ADDRESSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. YEAH THANK YOU SENATOR I'M HAPPY TO. THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION IS EIGHTY. EIGHT PILOTS TO INVESTIGATE A STRATEGY THAT WE'VE HAD SOME SUCCESS WITH OVER THE PAST YEAR. IN WORKING WITH. K. THROUGH TWELVE OUR COUNTERPARTS IN THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION SO FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OFFERS A DISCOUNT RIGHT IT'S CALLED THE E. RATE DISCOUNT AND SO IF YOUR OLD LIBRARY YOU'RE TRYING TO CONNECT YOU GET ANY RATE DISCOUNT. IF YOUR SCHOOL WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO CONNECT YOU GET ANY RATE JUST. SO WE WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT IF WE FIND A LIBRARY TO CONNECT. AND THE SCHOOL TO CONNECT AND BUILD THE PROJECTS AT THE SAME TIME. THOSE TWO DISCOUNTS HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT. TO GET BIDDERS TO AGREED TO SET TO DO PROJECTS TO CONNECT PLACES. THAT DIDN'T PENCIL OUT FOR THEM PREVIOUSLY. SO THIS THIRTY FIVE MILLION CHANGE THAT STRATEGY RIGHT SO THAT I CAN TELL YOU SOME OF THE PLACES THAT YOU WANT THAT WE'VE- COLLECTED USING THAT APPROACH LAST YEAR. SO THIS PROPOSAL TAKES THAT STRATEGY AND ENHANCED TELEHEALTH TO IT WHICH IS ALSO AN ADDITIONAL E. RATE DISCOUNT. SO IN OTHER WORDS IF WE'RE ABLE TO CONNECT PROJECTS THAT WEREN'T PENCILING OUT PREVIOUSLY BY DOING LIBRARIES PLUS SCHOOLS. THIS PROPOSAL AS LIBRARIES PLUS SCHOOLS PLUS TELESALES. AND THEN THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER THERE'S ANOTHER POT OF MONEY HERE ONE TIME MONEY IN A LIBRARY BUDGET. BUT WE'VE BEEN USING IT TO MAKE A MATCH RIGHT TO THAT SO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAYS. IT IN ESSENCE FOR EVERYBODY YOU PUT IN WILL GIVE YOU A CHANCE. SO WE ALSO MAKE A MATCHING FUND LIKE WRITE THE CHECK AND ALSO REDUCE THE COST OF. CONSTRUCTION AND- SO THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT GROUP DOES IS. A STRATEGY TO FIND PROJECTS THAT. SORT OF HAVE THAT KIND OF PRIVATE SECTOR. OF WHICH THERE ARE NUMBERS THAT WE'VE WE'VE ALREADY DETERMINED THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES FOR ME TO FOLLOW UP BEFORE WE GET TO LA- I GUESS I'M JUST A LITTLE BIT UNCLEAR STILL FROM YOUR DESCRIPTION AND FROM- THAT THAT PAPER THAT WE RECEIVED. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IS I MEAN YOU'RE OUTFITTING THE LIBRARIES THEMSELVES USING SUB DIFFERENT SUBSIDY PROGRAMS LIBRARIES THEMSELVES BECOME WIFI HUBS ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT PROVIDING YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN CHILDREN RECEIPT CARDS. THAT ALLOW THEM ACCESS TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF FIVE G. NETWORKS- YOU KNOW I GUESS I'M A LITTLE UNCLEAR ON ON WHAT DECISION I GUESS THE FOLLOW UP IS ONE OF THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO GET US ON A PILOT PROGRAM IS AT ONE LIBRARY IT TOTALLY OUTFITTED ISN'T. AND YOU KNOW HOW I WOULD TO WHAT DEGREE. ARE WE TALKING ABOUT EXPANDING INTERNET ACCESS- I CAN TAKE A CUT OF THAT UNLESS YOU UNLESS YOU WANT TO J. SOME- IT'S NOT ONE LIBRARY IT'SSMALL IT'S INVASION DAY AS BEING YOU KNOW MULTIPLE PROJECTS HOW MANY I CAN'T REALLY TELL YOU. SO FOR THE PAST SEVEN YEARS- LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN CONNECTING WE'VE BEEN HELPING LIBRARIES CONNECT TO. A BROADBAND NETWORK THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS PART OF C. S. U. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS. AND SO PART OF THE PROCESS OF CONNECTING TO THIS BROADBAND NETWORK IS EXTENDING BROADBAND PLACES THAT DON'T HAVE. SO THIS THIRTY FIVE MILLION TO HELPS RIGHT SO IT'S CONNECT. AT LEAST TO THIS BROADBAND NETWORK MIKE OKAY YEAH THAT THAT IS THAT HELPING FAMILY CONNECTING LIBRARIES THEMSELVES THE EXISTING NETWORK I GOT PRECISELY RIGHT LIBRARIES PLUS SCHOOLS AND THEN OFFERING AND THEN A TELEHEALTH CONNECTION AS WELL AS WHAT THE INTENT OF THIS PILOT PROJECT. WITH WITH AN IDEA WHAT THEY MEAN THE IDEA BEING THAT WITH THESE MULTIPLE DISK TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THESE MULTIPLE DISCOUNTS HARDER TO CONNECT PLACES IN THE STATE WHAT THE HELL WILL HAVE A GREATER LIKELIHOOD OF BEING. AND IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE I SAY IT'S A IT'S A THREE FOR TWO RIGHT. CANADA ASCEND REMAIN THAT- OKAY HE'S GOOD I THINK I'M GOOD- ALTHOUGH LA- HAS ANY COMMENTS THAT WOULD BE INTERESTED IN THOSE. ASHURA I'LL TAKE A STAB SO- MAYBE JUST TO REITERATE A FEW POINTS GREG MADE- HISTORICALLY LIBRARIES WERE IN CALIFORNIA WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR- DEVELOPING THEIR OWN CONNECTIONS TO THE INTERNET BUT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE STATE BEGAN AN INITIATIVE TO CONNECT LIBRARIES TO THE STATE'S EXISTING- INTERNET SYSTEM FOR EDUCATION AGENCIES THAT SYSTEM INCLUDES HIGHER READING K. TWELVE AND IT'S OVERSEEN BY AN ENTITY CALLED SCENIC- AND SUPPORTING THIS INITIATIVE THERE'S SOME ONGOING COSTS INCLUDING IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET- TO PAY FOR THE CONTRACT TO SCENIC. BUT THERE'S ALSO SOME OTHER STATE IN PREVIOUS YEARS AS PROVIDED SOMEONE TIME FUNDS- TO ASSIST LIBRARIES AND CONNECTING TO THE INTERNET AND ALSO FOR LIBRARIES THAT ARE CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET TO EXPAND THEIR- BROADBAND CAPACITY. IN YOUR AGENDA THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT GRANT PROGRAMS THERE'S- THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ONE AND IN THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR ONE. OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR ONE IS- A BIT MORE TYPICAL OF THE PREVIOUS GRANTS THAT WERE PROVIDED IS FOCUSED ON. CONNECTING LIBRARIES TO THIS MORE MORE LIBRARIES OF THE SYSTEM AND THEN EXPAND FOR LIBRARIES ARE CONNECTED IN. CONNECTING TO EXPANDING THEIR BROADBAND ACCESS. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT MOST LIBRARY JURISDICTIONS ARE CONNECTED TO THE SYSTEM BUT NOT ALL BRANCHES BRANCH LIBRARIES ARE SO- THAT WOULD BE SORT OF THE FOCUS IS GETTING THOSE REMAINING BRANCHES CONNECTED. AND THEN ALSO SIMILARLY FOR SOME JURISDICTIONS EXPANDING THEIR BROADBAND CAPACITY. HELLO ON THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL WE WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT- IN YOUR YOUR GENDER I THINK DESCRIBE THIS LATER BUT THERE'S SOME. ADDITIONAL UNSPENT FUNDING FROM PREVIOUS GRANT AWARDS IT'S ONE POINT THREE MILLION- IT WOULD BE REALLY APPROPRIATE IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU ADOPT THE REAPPROPRIATION- BUT THAT YOU GET MORE CLARITY AS TO- WHAT THEY- REMAINING NEED IS AND WHETHER- IN ALL THE SIX MILLION TO BE SPENT IN THIS YEAR OR- THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED THIS YEAR WITH THE REAPPROPRIATION AND- REDUCING THIS ONCE THOSE UNSPENT FUNDS ARE FULLY SPENT DOWN. ON THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL- I UNDERSTANDING IS IT IS THIS IS A SOMEWHAT NEWER INITIATIVE THAT'S INTENDED TO. FURTHER EXPAND INTERNET ACCESS THROUGH. COLLABORATIVE SPAM WITH SCHOOLS IN TELE HEALTH AGENCIES. AND HERE WE JUST HAVE A LOT MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL- IT'S A LITTLE UNCERTAINTY LAST HOW MANY CLAPPERS WITH THIS WITH SUPPORT IT'S ON. CERTAIN TO US HOW MUCH MORE FEDERAL E. RATE WOULD BE- DRAWN DOWN AS A RESULT OF THE PROPOSAL. I MEAN IT'S ALSO INCLUDING LAST- WHAT THE STATE FUNDS WOULD SPECIFICALLY COVER AND- BY THIS FUNDING IS NEEDED RIGHT WHY THESE AGENCIES- CAN'T FIND THESE ACTIVITIES FROM THEIR OPERATIONS. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE PROPOSALS WERE STILL WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON BUT THE ADMINISTRATION HASN'T- FULLY PROVIDED ALL THE INFORMATION ON THIS ONE. I THANK YOU I APPRECIATE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THIS PANEL WE APPRECIATE IT LET ME MAKE JUST A FEW BRIEF COMMENTS. R. ONE IS THAT- NOTE TO LA O'S OPENING COMMENTS. ABOUT EVERY ITEM IN AND WE APPRECIATE THAT THAT IS TRUE WE'LL TAKE A HARD LOOK AT EVERY ITEM. SECOND CHECK IN PRIOR HEARINGS WE TALKED ABOUT MAYBE NET YEAR LOOKING AT THE GOVERNANCE OF THE LIBRARY AND SEEING IF THERE'S A WAY. HER TO REVIEW IT SINCE IT'S BEEN A NUMBER OF DECADES THAT IS JUST CHANGE BIT BY BIT HANFORD. THE ISSUE OF- A FUNDING REQUEST FOR. RENEWING THE GRANT PROGRAM THAT EXISTED BEFORE. FOR L. G. B. T. ARCHIVES CAME UP AND I SUPPORT ADDING THAT. THERE WAS A CONCERN EXPRESSED SINCE THEN THAT THERE SHOULD BE A BROADER GROUPS. ARE INCLUDED AND I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT CONCERN IN THIS CASE. THERE'S A BIG CATCH UP IN ON WANTED NEEDED MAYBE NEXT YEAR. WE CAN LOOK AT A DIFFERENT GROUPS DIFFERENT ARCHIVES AND SEE IF THERE'S AN ISSUE AND WITH THAT- WILL COME BACK IN A FUTURE HEARING. FOR THE DECISIONS ON THIS ITEM BUT IT'S BEEN REALLY HELPFUL OF THIS DISCUSSION AND I APPRECIATE EVERYBODY. THAT WAS HERE TODAY. WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER TWO ISSUE NUMBER TWO WHICH IS THE MAY REVISION PROPOSALS FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. OF THE PANEL IS BRIAN RUTLEDGE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JASON CONSTANT TOURISTS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICER CEO BURTON AND FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE HERE THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. SO LET'S GO IN THAT ORDER AND BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD MORNING CHAIR SENATORS BRIAN RUTLEDGE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO WE HAVE A NUMBER OF. PROPOSALS FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA I'LL TRY TO BE QUICK AND SAVE SOME TIME FOR QUESTIONS. THE FIRST IS A 2% BASE AUGMENTATIN OF SIXTY NINE POINT THREE MILLION. ONGOING GENERAL FUND THAT WOULD BE IN ADDITION TO THE 3% A HUNDRED AND THREE POINT NINE MILLION BASE AUGMENTATION WE PROPOSED AT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SO EFFECTIVELY WE'RE PROPOSING TO COME UP TO A 5% TOTAL BASE AUGMENTATION FOR BUDGET YEAR. ALSO THAT'S IN ADDITION TO THE FEBRUARY EARLY ACTION AGREEMENT WHERE YOU SEE. WHAT IS NOW TO RECEIVE THREE HUNDRED TWO POINT FOUR MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND WHICH REFLECTS OUR- THE LEVEL OF THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT PRODUCTION. SO I'LL NOTE THAT THIS THIS BASE AUGMENTATION FROM A REVISED IT'S ALSO PREMISED ON THE SAME EXPECTATIONS YOU'LL RECALL FROM GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THAT'S THAT'S THAT THE UC WILL ADOPT POLICIES TO INCREASE ONLINE OFFERINGS AT TEN PERCENTAGE POINTS ABOVE PRE COBIT LEVELS THAT. DO YOU SEE WILL IMPLEMENT A NEW DUAL ADMISSIONS PROGRAM. AND THAT YOU SEE WILL HAVE A REPORT BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO DETAILING OUR PLANS TO CLOSE EQUITY GAPS BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. MINOR AMENDMENT WE'RE PROPOSING IT MAY IS ON THE EQUITY REPORT. OFFERED THANKS THAT WAS ORIGINALLY DUE JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE'RE NOW PROPOSING TO EXTEND THAT REPORTING REQUIREMENT TO DECEMBER THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THAT GOES FOR ALL SEGMENTS. ANOTHER ONGOING ADJUSTMENT THIS IS LARGELY TECHNICAL IN NATURE IS THAT FOR THE GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION PROP FIFTY SIX BACK FILL. OPPOSING A ONE POINT SIX MILLION OUR GENERAL FUND REDUCTION THAT'S TO MAINTAIN THE JIMMY RESIDENCY SLOT PROGRAM AT THE TOTAL OF FORTY MILLION. RESOURCES THAT THERE YOU SEE HAS TRADITIONALLY HAD. ANOTHER ONGOING OUR PROPOSAL WOULD BE TO ELIMINATE THE USE C. O. P. DO YOU SEE A AND R. AND YOU SEE PASS LINE ITEM THAT HAS BEEN SEPARATE FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. IN ORDER TO PRESERVE. TRANSPARENCY AND TO ALLOW FOR LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE BRANCH OVERSIGHT WE'RE ALSO PROPOSING SOME SOME BUDGET ILL LANGUAGE TO NOW ATTACHED TO THE HOUSTON MAIN ITEM THAT WOULD IN OUR VIEW OF TACTICALLY PRESERVE ON THE TRANSPARENCY FROM HAVING A SEPARATE ITEM. MOVING ON TO SOME ONE TIME ADJUSTMENTS THE BIGGEST FOR YOU SEE IS A PROPOSAL ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT FUNDS. SO THIS ONE FIFTY IN FEDERAL FUNDS. WOULD BE IN ADDITION TO THE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION FROM GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND THAT WOULD ALL BE FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECTS. SO AGAIN THAT'S A GENERAL FIND OUT FROM G. B. HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE AND NOW FEDERAL FUNDS OF A HUNDRED FIFTY FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. THE OTHER ANOTHER BIG ONE TIME PROPOSAL FOR YOU SEE IS FORTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME FOR ANIMAL SHELTER GRANTS. THE FUNDING WOULD GO TO UC DAVIS SCORED- ANIMAL SHELTER MEDICAL- THE SHELTER PROGRAM- THAT WOULD BE TO BUILD ON THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT INCLUDED A- THE FIVE MILLION- AUGMENTATION FOR UC DAVIS TO START THIS PROGRAM THE FORTY FIVE MILLION. WOULD ESSENTIALLY LET- UC DAVIS ROLL OUT OVER FIVE YEARS A GRANT PROGRAM AND SUPPORT. SHELTERS ACROSS THE STATE IN ACHIEVING WHAT IS ALREADY ON THE BOOKS AS A STATEWIDE GOAL SO THAT NO TREATABLE OUR ADOPTABLE ANIMALS WOULD BE EUTHANIZED. ALL KNOW THAT THERE'S WE ALSO TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO IMPLEMENT THAT GRANT PROGRAM. ANOTHER ONE TIME PROPOSALS FIFTEEN MILLION ONE TIME TO RENOVATE UCLA'S LAWSON LABOR CENTER FACILITY. ANOTHER ONE TIME PROPOSAL IS TEN POINT TWO MILLION GENERAL FUND FOR THE UCSF DYSLEXIA CENTER THAT'S BUILDING ON PREVIOUS INVESTMENTS IN DYSLEXIA. THIS WOULD SPECIFICALLY BE FOR- IMPROVING DEVELOPING AN APT FOR OUR SCREENING AND EARLY INTERVENTION. IN ADDITION TO TEACHER TRAINING SUPPORT AND DYSLEXIA RESEARCH. ANOTHER INVESTMENT IS FIVE MILLION ONE TIME IN THE UCLA ASIAN AMERICAN STUDIES CENTER THAT WOULD BE FOR ANALYSIS AND RESEARCH THAT PREVENTS I HATE INCIDENTS RELATED TO API COMMUNITIES AS% WELL AS- PROVIDE GRANTS TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO DO THE SAME. THE LAST ONE TIME INVESTMENT IN YOU SEE% WE'RE PROPOSING IS ONE MILLION. FOR THE UC BERKELEY ALTERNATIVE MEATS LAB TO SUPPORT THE LAB. SHE ALSO NOTE A COUPLE ARE ADJUSTMENTS HERE THAT AREN'T- THEY DON'T INVOLVE THE GENERAL FUND AMOUNT. PROPOSING TO EXTEND TO IT TOO. TO UNDO ELIMINATE THE SUMMER TERM FINANCIAL AID SUSPENSION LANGUAGE SO IN THE PAST FEW YEARS WE'VE ADJUSTED EACH BUDGET. THE SUNSET DATE OF THE SUMMER TERM FINANCIAL AID SO EFFECTIVELY THIS WOULD IMPACT BUDGET YEAR WHICH ARE READY BASED ON GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS SET TO PROVIDE YOU SEE FOUR MILLION FOR SUMMER ED. THIS WOULD EFFECTIVELY MEAN THE OUT YEARS BUT FOUR MILLION IS ONGOING. YOU'LL SEE SOMETHING SIMILAR FOR CSU. THE EMERGENCY STUDENT FINANCIAL AID THAT WE PROPOSE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FIFTEEN MILLION ONE TIME WE'RE ALSO PROPOSING AMENDMENTS TO THE ELIGIBILITY THE GOAL IS TO ALIGN WITH AB EIGHTY FIVE. MAYBE EIGHTY FIVE PROVIDED CCC STUDENTS WITH CURRENT YEAR EMERGENCY STUDENT FINANCIAL AID. AND IT SPECIFIED THAT STUDENTS WERE ELIGIBLE IF THEY WERE ENROLLED HALF TIME AND IT EXEMPTED STUDENTS FROM A GPA REQUIREMENT IF THEY WERE ENROLLED AND DISABILITY PROGRAMS CHARMIN MINTS ARE ESSENTIALLY TO ALIGN WITH THAT AND THE RESULT WOULD BE WE'RE PROPOSING TO RESCIND UNDER A WORK REQUIREMENT. TO CHANGE THE FULL TIME REQUIREMENT AT HALF TIME. I TEND TO INCLUDE A G. P. EXEMPTION FOR DISABILITY ENROLLED STUDENTS- THAT'S ALL FOR THE ELIGIBILITY FOR THAT EMERGENCY. FINANCIAL AID FUND- FINDING. THE ONE OTHER MINOR ADJUSTMENT IS THE BIG ONE AT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE PROPOSED A MILLION. ONGOING RESOURCES FOR- YOU SEE TO ADOPT A COMMON LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO ALIGN WITH THE OTHER SEGMENTS. WE'RE CLARIFYING OR PROVIDING AN AMENDED LANGUAGE TO CLARIFY THAT THE INTENT OF THE PROPOSAL IT IS NOT TO ADOPT A SPECIFIC PROGRAM INSTEAD IT'S TO. HAVE THE SEGMENTS WORK TOGETHER TO ADOPT THE MOST REASONABLE PROGRAM. LASTLY AND THIS IS A BIG BIG PROPOSAL THAT AFFECTS ALL SEGMENTS BUT IT DOES SHOW UP IN UC'S BUDGET SPECIFICALLY. THAT'S WERE PROPOSING ONE BILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND SPLIT BETWEEN BUDGET HERE AT TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE SO FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN BUDGET YEAR FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. THAT WOULD BE TO ESTABLISH LEARNING ALIGNED EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM. TO PROVIDE LEARNING ALIGNED LONG TERM CAREER DEVELOPMENT FOR UC CSU AND CCC STUDENTS. SO THE WAY THIS WOULD WORK IS THE BILLION. ONE TIME GENERAL FUND WOULD CREATE AN ENDOWMENT ADMINISTERED BY THE UC. BASED ON THE PROPORTION OF PELL ELIGIBLE STUDENTS AT EACH SEGMENT YOU SEE WOULD ALLOCATE THE ANNUAL RETURNS FROM THE AN ENDOWMENT. AND THEN DOT FUNDING WOULD SUPPORT A STATE FUNDED WORK STUDY PROGRAM. KNOW THAT THE ELIGIBILITY FOR THAT STATE FUNDED WORK STUDY PROGRAM WHICH WOULD BE R. EIGHT A STUDENT WITH FINDING DEMONSTRATED FINANCIAL NEED. THAT ISN'T FROM AN UNDERREPRESENTED BACKGROUND. AND WE'RE ALSO PRIORITIZING STEM MAJORS IN STEM EMPLOYERS WITH THAT- WE HAVE THE TRAILER BILLING WHICH ASSOCIATE WITH THAT AS WELL SO WITH THAT ALL ALL SAY WE ARE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO THE LA- SO I THINK IT'LL BE HELPFUL TO THEM I WORK FROM PAGE SEVEN OF YOUR AGENDA. THIS PAGE SHOWS A TABLE SUMMARIZING ALL OF THE GENERAL FUND- PROPOSALS THAT YOU SEE- IT SHOWS NO PROPOSALS THAT WERE AND GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BACK IN JANUARY. ON THE PROPOSALS NOW UNDER MAYOR VISION AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO- AND I WOULD JUST NOTE IT'S ALL GENERAL FUND THERE IS A AN ADDITIONAL AT THE MOMENT AS HE ADMINISTRATION NOTED ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDING FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE- THAT SADDAM. IS IMPORTANT BUT NOT B. B. THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. IMAGINE pDAUNTING TO WORK THROUGH I CAN THINK OF TIME I WON'T GO THROUGH EVERY SINGLE PROPOSAL. I'LL JUST TOUCH ON FOUR KEY ISSUES- THAT THE COMMITTEE IS FACING RIGHT NOW. THE FIRST ISSUE I WILL HIGHLIGHT IS BASED IN PART FOR YOU SEE. AND THAT IS REALLY SUMMARIZED IN THOSE FIRST TWO ITEMS UNDER THE ON GOING. THAT'S THE THREE OH TWO MILLION OR ON RESTORATION FUNDS TO GET YOU SEE BACK TO ITS- PREVIOUS LEVEL SUPPORT PRE PANDEMIC. AND THEN AN ADDITIONAL BASE INCREASE UNDER THE MAY REVISION IT THE ADMINISTRATION'S INCREASING THE BASE INCREASE FROM 3% 25% WELL WE THINK IT'S REASONABLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONTEMPLATE PROVIDING. A BASE INCREASES TO UC EVEN ABOVE RESTORATION FUNDS YOU SEE DOES FACE COST PRESSURES EACH YEAR AND THIS YEAR CERTAINLY DIFFERENT- IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT WHAT THAT BASING CREASE COULD BE WE THINK A REASONABLE PLACE TO START- CONSIDERATION FOR YOUR BASE INCREASE IS- YOU SEIZE. KEY OPERATING COSTS THINGS LIKE. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT COST INCREASES DEBT SERVICE. WHEN WE SUM THAT UP IT GETS US TO A LITTLE UNDER EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS OR A JUST OVER 2% BASED INCREASE BUT THE LEGISLATURE COULD PREVENT CONSIDER PROVIDING- LARGER BASE INCREASE IN THAT FOR EXAMPLE BY ADOPTING A 3% PROPOSED IN JANUARY OR THE DOING THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS IT WOULD BE FINDING ADDITIONAL YOU SEE PRIORITIES LIKE EMPLOYEE SALARY INCREASES STUDENT SUCCESS INITIATIVES OR ENHANCING STUDENTS CERTAIN STUDENT SERVICES. THAT SAID A YOU SEE WOULD HAVE FLEXIBILITY TO WAIVE THESE DIFFERENT PRIORITIES WITH AN UNRESTRICTED BASE INCREASE OF THE LEGISLATURE. WANTS TO ENSURE THAT YOU SEE IS FUNDING SOME OF THESE PRIORITIES WE RECOMMEND IT SPECIFY THAT IN THE END BUDGET ACTS. THE SECOND ISSUE I WANT TO TOUCH ON IS THAT VERY FIRST ONE TIME PROPOSAL IN OUR TABLE IT SAYS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN BUDGET YEAR. THE PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THAT IN THERE. AND THAT YOU'RE AFTER SO THIS WOULD BE A BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL. AND WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO DO IS TO PROVIDE YOU SEE ONE TIME FUNDING TO CREATE AN ENDOWMENT THAT WOULD. THEN SUPPORTS- EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS- THE SUPPORT WOULD COME FROM THE ANNUAL EARNINGS FROM THE ENDOWMENT. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE FUNDING% APPROACH- INVESTING THE FUNDS IN AND DOMINANCE- COULD POTENTIALLY MEAN INVESTING THEM IN EQUITIES. BUT THIS IS UNUSUAL FOR STATE FUNDS TYPICALLY THE STATE INVESTED FUNDS AND LOWER RISK- SECURITIES LIKE GOVERNMENT-SECURITIES. ON SO THAT'S A CORE ISSUE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER IS SORT OF THE ADDED RISK- FOR THESE PARTICULAR STATE FUNDS. ALSO BY EXPOSING THE FUNDS TO EQUITIES- THE ANNUAL REVENUE COMING FROM THE INDICTMENT. COULD BE VOLATILE AND THAT COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR CAMPUSES AND FOR STUDENTS TO THE PLAN EACH YEAR. THE PROPOSAL ALSO RAISES SOME PROGRAMMATIC QUESTIONS IN OUR MIND- IT'S UNCLEAR HOW THE WHAT THE ROLE OF THE STATE VERSUS EMPLOYERS WOULD BE AND I'M PAYING FOR STUDENT STIPENDS. AND IT'S ALSO UNCLEAR HOW THIS PROGRAM AND INTERACT WITH THE STATE'S EXISTING FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS. FOR ALL THESE REASONS ON THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL WE RECOMMEND YOU REJECT IT. NOW DOES THIRTY SHE WANNA COVER IS ALL OF THE REMAINING ONE TIME PROPOSALS HERE AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THE MAY REVISION NOTABLY INCREASES THE NUMBER OF- ONE TIME PROPOSALS THAT YOU SEE. SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS ARM WE THINK OUR HIGH STREET PRIORITIES AGAIN- YOU'VE HEARD AS MENTIONED THIS MANY TIMES BEFORE AND HEARINGS WE THINK DEFERRED MAINTENANCE- IT HAS VERY CERTAIN BENEFITS TO THE STATE IT FUNDS PROJECTS THAT IF THEY ARE OTHERWISE COVERED WITH. INCREASING COSTS IN FUTURE YEARS. TO ADDRESSING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE HELPS ADDRESS BUDGET RESILIENCY BOTH FOR YOU SEE AND FOR THE STATE. OTHER PROPOSALS COVER UP PRIORITIES- THAT COULD BE OF INTEREST TO LEGISLATURE BUT THE BENEFITS ARE- POTENTIALLY IN CERTAIN. THINGS LIKE- ANIMAL SHELTER OUT REACH RESEARCH ON ALTERNATIVE MEAT PRODUCTS- RESEARCH ON DEVELOPING NEW EDUCATION BASED TECHNOLOGIES. WE ALSO NOTE THAT ALL OF THE ONETIME PROPOSALS MEANS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S EFFECTIVELY PROPOSING TO SPREAD IT A ONE TIME FUNDING OVER MANY DIFFERENT PRIORITIES THIS ALLOWS THE STATE TO COVER LOTS OF PRIORITIES BUT IT ALSO. SPREADS FUNDS SIMPLY AND POTENTIALLY UNDERMINES THE STATE'S ABILITY TO ADDRESS ANY OF THESE PRIORITIES MEANINGFULLY OR FULLY. ONE ALTERNATIVE THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER IT TO BE A BIT MORE STRATEGIC AND PRIORITIZE PROVIDING MORE ONE TIME FUNDING- FOR A SELECT NUMBER OF ONE OF PRIORITIES THAT. ARE AT THE HIGHEST. BENEFIT TO THE STATE AND OF THE HIGHEST INTEREST TO THE LEGISLATURE. THE FINAL ISSUE I WANT TO TOUCH ON IS ACTUALLY NOT IN THIS TABLE IT'S A LANGUAGE ONLY ISSUE AND THAT IS THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT'S LINE ITEM. NOW IS STARKLY YOU SEE. HAS HAD THE ABILITY TO ALLOCATE FUNDS TO THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT I'M FROM THEIR APPROPRIATION- BUT A FEW YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED- A LINE ITEM ON THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT WITH THE INTENT OF GETTING MORE OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL OVER THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET. ON THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOW REQUESTING TO ELIMINATE THIS LINE ITEM AND GIVE YOU SEE- MORE FLEXIBILITY TO MANAGE ITS RESOURCES ACROSS THE SYSTEM. ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE WE RECOMMEND MAINTAINING THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT'S LINE ITEM- FOR ONE THING WE THINK THAT THE COST PRESSURES SMALL DATE THERE ARE SOME SIMILAR COST PRESSURES BETWEEN THE CAMPUSES IN THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT- THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T. FACE A ROMAN GROWTH FOR EXAMPLE DOESN'T FACE COST PRESSURES WERE WITH A STUDENT ON SUCCESS AND IT SHOULD HAVE YOUR STUDENT SERVICES. I THINK IT'S REASONABLE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WANT TO TARGET FUNDS DIFFERENTLY FOR THESE DIFFERENT DIVISIONS WITHIN YOU SEE. WE ALSO THINK HAVING A LINE ITEM AND IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY WHICH WE UNDERSTAND THAT ADMINISTRATION'S RATIONALE OF PROPOSING NEW REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. WITHIN THOSE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS- ARE WORTHY OF ADOPTING. BUT WE THINK HAVING A LINE ITEM FURTHER ENHANCES TRANSPARENCY BY CLARIFYING HOW MUCH STATE FUNDING IS BEING PROVIDED TO THESE DIVISIONS. WE DO RECOMMEND SOME MODIFICATION TO THE CURRENT LINE ITEM FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A THERE'S ONE PART OF THE ONE ITEM THAT PROVIDES FUNDING FOR A PROGRAM CALLED YOU SEE PAST. THIS IS A CENTRALIZED ADMINISTRATIVE PROGRAM- THAT FOCUS ON THINGS LIKE PAYROLL AND HUMAN RESOURCES- SHIFTING THOSE FUNDS BACK TO THE CAMPUS APPROPRIATION WOULD ALLOW THE UNIVERSITY TO FUND THE PROGRAM BY CHARGING CAMPUSES FEES. WE THINK THAT MODEL IS A BIT MORE EFFICIENT IT WAS. IT BETTER IN SOME DEVICE CAMPUSES TO MANAGE THEIR OWN ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS WHEN SUPPORTING THIS PROGRAM. THIS PARTICULAR ONE FOR FREE C. PAP THE PARTICULAR WE RECOMMEND- SHIFTING THAT BACK TO THE CAMPUSES. AGAIN FOR THE SAKE OF TITLE ENDED THERE BUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THAT. COME UP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WILL MOVE TO THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. BUT THANK YOU TERROR ALERTS CITY OF R. TEN AND- FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA- ALL DRESSED EACH OF THE ITEMS IN THE AGENDA IN CHARGE- ON TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS GRATEFUL TO THE GOVERNOR PROPOSING A 5% BASED BUDGET INCREASE THAT USED THE OPERATING BUDGET. IN ADDITION TO THE FULL BASE BUDGET RESTORATION THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE CREATURE IN FEBRUARY. UC REGENTS REQUESTED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SIX MILLION TO SUSTAIN CAMPUS OPERATIONS AND PROVIDE POLICY COVERED STAFF AND FACULTY. 83% SALARY ADJUSTMENT. WE CONTINUE TO REQUEST AN ADDITIONAL EIGHTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO MEET THESE GOALS FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. THESE FUNDS WILL ARE THE UC CAMPUSES TO COVER NEW COSTS SUCH AS RETIREMENT HEALTH CARE REPRESENTED LABOR SALARY AGREEMENTS. OUR DESIRE TO PROVIDE A SALARY ADJUSTMENTS ARE POLICY COVERED STAFF IS DRIVEN BY WANTING SALARIES TO KEEP UP WITH INFLATION. UC CAMPUSES CONTRIBUTE GREATLY TO THE LOCAL ECONOMIES AND S. THIRD LARGEST EMPLOYER IN THE STATE IT IS IMPORTANT WE ENSURE THE WELLBEING OF OUR EMPLOYEES. IN ADDITION YOU SEE CONTINUES TO REQUEST- FOR TARGETED INVESTMENTS FOR OUR STUDENTS. WE REQUEST THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDE HOUSTON WITH THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING FUNDING TO BEGIN CLOSING GRADUATION EQUITY GAPS. ALONG WITH MORE TIME TO ACHIEVE THE RESULTS. IN ADDITION YOU SEE REQUEST FORTY THREE MILLION AND ONGOING INVESTMENTS IN BONNER WILL STUDENTS INCLUDING EXPANSION. OF THE SUCCESSFUL STATE PROGRAM THAT PREPARES UNDERSERVED STUDENTS FOR UNIVERSITY EDUCATION. YOU SEE REQUEST THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME INVESTMENTS FROM THE STATE. INCLUDING REPATRIATION OF TRIBAL REMAINS STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH TELEHEALTH CAPACITY AND ONLINE. LEARNING EQUIPMENT AND PREPARATION. I I'LL CONTINUE TO THE I'D ON YOUR- WHICH IS USE YOUR FELINE I- WE'RE VERY. THANKFUL TO GOVERNOR OR RECOGNIZING THE DIFFICULTIES TO YOU STILL P. OPERATIONS CENTER. AS A RESULT OF PCAOB LINE ITEM. THERE ARE A FEW NOTES I WISH TO MAKE ABOUT THIS TOPIC. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS A CHANGE IN FUNDING METHODOLOGY ONLY. EXTENSIVE BUDGET REFORMS YOU SEE UNDERTOOK TO IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. WILL STAY IN PLACE. ONE OF THESE REFORMS WAS THE FORMATION OF THE EXECUTIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE COMPOSED OF CHANCELLORS VICE CHANCELLORS OF FINANCE AND OTHER CAMPUS LEADERS. REVIEW USE YOUR P. EXPENDITURES AND PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO PRESIDENT ON THE USE YOUR B. PROGRAMS AND EXPENDITURES. THIS GROUP WILL CONTINUE IN THIS IMPORTANT ROLE PROVIDING CAMPUS INPUT ON YOU STILL BE FINANCES. BUT THERE ARE MANY MORE FARMS SOME OF THEM TECHNICAL BUT NO LESS IMPORTANT. THESE REFORMS INCLUDE Q. C. O. P. RESERVE POLICY THAT WAS DEVELOPED AND DOCUMENTED. YOU C. O. P. RESERVES ARE NOT REPORTED QUARTERLY TO THE UC REGENTS ALONG WITH BUDGETED AMOUNT FOR ACTUAL EXPENDITURES. THESE PUBLIC QUARTERLY PRESENTATIONS WILL CONTINUE UNCHANGED. YOU SEE OKAY EMPLOYMENT DID AN ENTIRE NEW BUDGET AND PLANNING SYSTEM. ORACLE CLOUD FINANCIAL SYSTEMS PROVIDES YOU STEAL PEOPLE GENERAL LEDGER THAT ALLOWS THE TRACKING OF PLANNED BUDGETS AND ACTUAL EXPENDITURES. WITH FAR GREATER EASE. USING THIS AND HAS TRACKING SYSTEM SEE OKAY NOW YOU ACTUAL X. ABOARD. PROVIDE GREATER ACT. THESE WERE FOR WILL STATE EVEN AS DIFFERENT FUNDING METHODOLOGY IS ADOPTED. OTHER HELPFUL REFORMS THAT WERE COMPLETED INCLUDE A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF EACH USE YOU'LL BE FINE AND ITS USE. THERE WAS ALSO AN EXPENSIVE PROCESS TO DOCUMENT EACH PROGRAM AN INITIATIVE AND PROVIDE CLEAR DEFINITIONS OF EACH. A LONG LIST OF IMPLEMENTED REFORMS MEANS THAT THE UCP BUDGET TODAY IS NOT TO USE YOUR B. BUDGET OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. TRANSPARENCY DOCUMENTATION AND DECISION MAKING YOU HAVE ALL CHANGED THESE IMPORTANT CHANGES WILL REMAIN EVEN AS THE FUNDING MECHANISM CHANGES. AMONG THE CHANGES FROM THE LINE ITEM WAS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW C. O. P. UNALLOCATED RESERVES OVER A HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN PROVIDED BY YOU STILL CREATE THE CAMPUS'S LEADING YOU SEE OKAY WITH UNALLOCATED RESERVE OF ZERO BY JUNE TWENTY NINETEEN. THIS DID CAUSE DIFFICULTIES AND RESPONDING TO THE PANDEMIC WHEN YOU C. O. P. COULD NOT BE NIMBLE AND RESPONDING. TO EVOLVING CAMPUS NEEDS. THIS CALL CONSTRAINTS OF HAVING SEE OKAY BUDGET MAINTAINS OR- SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN WERE VERY MUCH HIGHLIGHTED DURING THE PANDEMIC. FOR EXAMPLE WITH HOSPITALS OPERATING CRISIS MODE THAT WAS NEAT OUR SYSTEM WIDE CHIEF CLINICAL OFFICER. IN ORDER TO HIRE SUCH AN INDIVIDUAL YOU SEE WHAT WE HAD TO LET GO OTHER POSITIONS IN ORDER TO FREE UP FUNDS FOR THE CRITICAL FUNCTION. THIS SLOWED DOWN HIRING BY MONTH'S END MEANT THE LOSS OF EMPLOYEES WHO CONDUCTED OTHER WORK FOR THE SYSTEM. YOU STILL PAY COULD NOT USE FEDERAL STIMULUS FUNDS FOR EMERGENCY BECAUSE AS A SEPARATE LINE ITEM WE COULD NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE FROM THE CAMPUSES. I ASK THAT YOU APPROVED THE CHANGE THAT YOU SEE OKAY FUNDING METHODOLOGY. AND I'LL MOVE ON TO THE LEARNING ALIGNED IN GOVERNMENT NEXT AND I DO HAVE SOMEONE HERE AS WELL WHO CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS- WE ARE VERY THANKFUL FOR THE- TRUST THAT THE GOVERNOR PLACES AND USE YOUR INVESTMENT TEAM IN PROGRAM MANAGEMENT- THE PROPOSAL TO CREATE A STATE FUNDED LEARNING ALIGNED. IMPLEMENT PROGRAM WOULD HELP INCENTIVIZE MEANINGFUL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR STUDENTS. DOING SO SERVES THE STATE'S INTEREST BY CREATING WELL PREPARED WORK FORCE AS WELL AS A STRONGER CONNECTION BETWEEN INSTITUTES OF HIGHER EDUCATION THAT EMPLOYERS. FURTHERMORE ELIZA ST I'M PRESIDENT DRAKE'S INTEREST IN PROVIDING DEBT FREE OPTIONS FOR OUR STUDENTS. THE FIRST PART OF CREATING A DEBT FREE PATH IS MORE FINANCIALLY BUT THESECOND PART IS CREATING MEANINGFUL WORK FOR STUDENTS TO SATISFY THE WORK STUDY COMPONENT OF ANY FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE. CURRENTLY YOU SEE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER MANAGES APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX. HUNDRED AND SIXTY BILLION EXCUSE ME- IN ASSETS SO ADDING A ONE BILLION DOLLARS IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE AND YOU SEE HAS A PROCESS IN PLACE. OR. MANAGING AFFILIATED ENDOWMENTS. YOU STAND DOWN ARE ABOUT FOUR POINT 75% INTEREST PER. AND ALL AND- AND EARNINGS ARE PAID AT THE END OF JUNE YEAR. THIS MEANS OF THE PAYMENT CAMPUSES WILL TAKE PLACE JUNE TWENTY ONE TWO. I DO THINK THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN THE FIRST COUPLE YEARS MAYBE SUBSTANTIAL AND I HOPE TO RETURN TO THE COMMITTEE SOON. WHEN THE INVESTMENT NEEDED TO GET PROGRAM OPERATIONAL IF ADDITIONAL- INVESTMENT IS NEEDED- I DO WANT TO EXPRESS A CAUTION THE STOCK MARKET CAN LOSE VALUE AND SOMETIMES. GREATLY AS WE SAW IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. THIS MEANS THAT THE INVESTED ENDOWMENT PRINCIPAL CAN DECREASE IN VALUE DUE TO FACTORS OUTSIDE IF YOU SEIZE CONTROL. DURING THE YEARS WHEN THE INVESTMENT VALUE TO CLIENTS TO PAY OUT OF THE PROGRAM WOULD ALSO DECLINE. TAYLOR THE LANGUAGE- WE HAVE TO COMPLIANCE CONCERNS. FIRST WE DO NOT THINK THAT THE PROGRAM CAN BE LIMITED TO UNDER REPRESENTED STUDENTS GIVEN THE STATE'S CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS OF PROP TWO OH NINE. AND SECOND WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO PROVIDING THESE FUNDS JOHN DOCUMENTS STUDENTS BUT WE NEED TO NOTE THAT ONLY STUDENTS WITH WORK AUTHORIZATION THEY HAVE EMPLOYMENT EVEN IF. IT EVEN IF IT IS STATE MONEY AND- THE THIRD ISSUE I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FOR THE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION IS WHETHER THESE FUNDS ARE PLACED IN AN ENDOWMENT. OR A FUN FUNCTIONING AS AN INDICTMENT. OF THESE TWO FUNDS ARE VERY SIMILAR BUT THE PRINCIPLE OF BEING DOWN IT CANNOT BE WITHDRAWN EASILY. WE RECOMMEND YOU APPROVE FUNDING FUNCTIONING AS AN INDICTMENT IN CASE YOU WISH TO MAKE CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM OR RE UTILIZED TO ONE BILLION PRINCIPAL FOR NEW PURPOSE IN FUTURE YOUR- AND THEN. LET ME JUST- QUICKLY COVER DEFERRED MAINTENANCE- WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED INVESTMENT OF THREE TWENTY. THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION TOWARDS UC'S DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND ENERGY PROJECTS. IN OUR EARLIER REQUEST MISTAKE WE HAD IDENTIFIED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF PROJECTS THAT WOULD START VERY SOON. THE REMAINING FUNDING WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO OUR CAMPUS IS BASED ON A FORMULA. OF IN PARK SQUARE FOOTAGE AND THE AGE OF CAMPUS STATES A PORTABLE SPACE. BERMAIN PROJECTS WILL COME FROM A LIST OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS ALREADY IDENTIFIED BY THE CAMPUSES. ARE CRITICAL PROJECTS THAT ARISE AND WERE PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN. EVERY UC CAMPUS. WILL RECEIVE A PORTION OF THESE FUNDS. THESE FUNDS WILL ALLOW THE UNIVERSITY TO ADDRESS CRITICAL DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ISSUES- COMPLETE ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECTS AND INCREASE LOCAL EMPLOYMENT. IN ADDITION TO THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE UC HAS BILLIONS IN SEISMIC RENOVATION NEEDS AND BUILDING UPGRADES. WE SUBMITTED A ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR LIST FOR THESE PROECTS AND THE GOVERNOR AND IF THE COMMITTEE HAS AVAILABLE FUNDING JALAN KE TOWARDS THESE PARTNERSHIPS WE WOULD APPRECIATE THAT. NEXT LET ME MOVE ON TO THE INDIVIDUAL PROPOSALS BY THE GOVERNOR- WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S SPACE IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM AND LOOKING TO US FOR EXPERTISE. JUST A TRUCK TOUCH ON THESE VERY QUICKLY TO UCLA LABOR CENTER EXERCISING GLOBAL BY BUILDING THAT NEEDS TO BE RENOVATED. UC SAN FRANCISCO DYSLEXIA CENTER FUNDING. WOULD HEY THE TRANSLATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH AT UC SAN FRANCISCO AND APPLY IT TO A REAL USABLE TOOL FOR OUR KINDERGARTEN FIRST AND SECOND GRADE TEACHERS TO ASSESS STUDENTS FOR LEARNING DISABILITIES. CURRENTLY MANY STUDENTS ESPECIALLY LOW INCOME AND UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY STUDENTS WHO ARE EARLY ON IN THEIR- SCHOOLING. ARE NOT DIAGNOSED PROPERLY FOR LEARNING DISABILITIES I'M PROVIDING TEACHERS WITH THIS TOOL COULD BE REALLY LIFE CHANGING FOR THE STUDENTS. THE TOOL- IS GOING TO BE USABLE ON A SIMPLE COMPUTER IT WILL BE EXPANDED TO. OTHER BRAIN FUNCTIONING STAR FUNDAMENTAL FOR SCHOOL READINESS READINESS AND READING A QUESTION C. INCLUDING WORKING MEMORY LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION OF START REASONING TASK SHIFTING AND COGNITIVE AND EMOTIONAL CONTROL. ATTENTION EMOTIONAL RECOGNITION AND EMOTION REGULATION- WE'RE ALSO WORKING ON A SPANISH VERSION OF THAT RULE SO WE REQUEST YOUR APPROVAL EXPANDS. AND FINALLY- THE ASIAN AMERICAN STUDIES OF FUNDING IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN A DRAMATIC INCREASE OF HATE INCIDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. AND TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES AND MAKE CERTAIN THAT- THESE SORTS OF INCIDENTS DON'T SPREAD IT AND R. ALLEVIATED WE REQUEST YOUR APPROVAL OF THESE FUNDS. THE BERKELEY ALTERNATIVE NEEDS LAST MONDAY WILL BE USED- TOWARDS PROVIDING FOOD ALTERNATIVES WHICH ARE VERY IMPORTANT OR- CLIMATE CHANGE AND NOW LET ME TURN IT OVER TO- OUR DIRECTOR OF DEFEAT CORRECT- ADAMS SHIP CORRECT SHELTER MEDICINE PROGRAM KATE HURLEY DR KATE HURLEY WHO WILL. BRIEFLY. DISCUSS THE- ANIMAL SHOW PO. I APPRECIATE THAT AND I KNOW TO BRIEFLY SO- PLEASE IT BECAUSE HAVE A- FOR MORE ITEMS AND A LOT OF QUESTIONS ON THIS UNLIMITED TALK SO WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I JUST TRIED A LITTLE TINY BIT OF CONTEXT SENSING ANIMAL SHELTERS ARE NOT COMMONLY DISCUSSED IN THE COMMITTEE. THE PROPOSAL WAS ORIGINALLY ENTERED INTRODUCED IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY IN THE CONTEXT OF MORE ANIMALS LOSING THEIR LIVES IN CALIFORNIA SHELTERS AND IN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE LAST.IN SPITE OF THE STATE'S POLICY BALL SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT NO HEALTHIER TREATABLE ANIMAL BE EUTHANIZED THAT WERE THE MOST POPULOUS STATE IN THE COUNTRY TO BE FAIR AND THERE HAS BEEN SOME PROGRESS MADE BUT% MANY OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES SEVEN LEFT BEHIND. AND RURAL AREAS AND POCKETS OF URBAN AREAS. AND WE STILL SEE THE HIGHEST RATES OF INTAKE AND EUTHANASIA AND ARTS REGIONS THIS PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD. AND ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE SERVED BY SHELTERS THAT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO KEEP ANIMALS HEALTHY AND SAFE GET THEM OUT THE DOOR LIGHTS AND KEEP PETS AND PEOPLE TOGETHER. AND THEN TO PROVIDE SOME MORE RECENT CONTACTS THE COMBINATION. AND WILDFIRES HIGHLIGHTED THE ESSENTIAL ROLE THAT SHOT JUST PLAY IN CALIFORNIA'S CRISIS RESPONSE AND RECOVERY SHELTERS PROVIDING CARE FOR PETS AND PEOPLE ARE HOSPITALIZED WITH COLIN. THEY FOUND WAYS TO DELIVER IT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE HOME BOUND SO IT COULD STAY WITH THEIR ANIMALS THEY CARE FOR PETS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE DISPLACED BY WILDFIRES AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE A GROUP CRITICAL PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY RECALL. A KEEPING DANGEROUS INTERNET ANIMALS- OFF THE STREETS AND PROPERLY CARED FOR AGAIN WE SAW THE LEAST RESOURCE CENTER STRUGGLING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE HARDEST HIT COMMUNITIES. AND AS WE MOVE INTO THE RECOVERY PHASE WE ALSO SEE THAT WE ARE SEEING SOME THREATS AS SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO GO BACK TO WORK AND OTHER PEOPLE CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH THE ECONOMIC. FALLOUT IN INTAKE CONTINUES TO RISE AT SHELTERS SO THIS ONE TIME INVESTMENT WOULD PROVIDE BOTH THE TRAINING FOR OUR PROGRAM. AND THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TARGETED GRANTS FOR SOLDIERS TO SUPPORT PEOPLE AND FAMILIES. THROUGHOUT THE RECOVERY AND BEYOND. THANK YOU I WAS VERY ENOUGH. YES HE WORKED WITH YOU AND WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO QUEST BUT LET ME MAKE A COMMON ABOUT THAT FOR. IT WHICH IS. I CHAIRED A MAY SPECIAL ONE I WAS IN ASSEMBLY AND THE ESTIMATE FOR THE ANNUAL COST OF THAT MANDATE AT THE TIME OF THE ADOPTION OF THE BILL. IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT WAS THREE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THEN THIS LINE ITEM IS FIFTEEN TIMES THAT IT IS A FRACTION OF WHAT THE STATE SPENDS ON ANIMAL SHELTERS AND SO. THAT THAT IS JUST A CONTEXT TO BE CONSIDERED. THE THERE THERE WAS A LOT OF SUBJECTS ARE RAISED HERE AND SO WHAT THE BEGIN OF WITH A FEW QUESTIONS AND THEN GO TO MY COLLEAGUES. FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- WERE ME BEGIN BY ASKING WHAT THE RATIONALE WAS. FOR KEEPING ENROLLMENT FLAT AT UC AND NOT FUNDING ENROLLMENT GROWTH. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SURE LAYERED SO THE MAY REVISION AS YOU KNOW DOES NOT SPECIFY ENROLLMENT TARGETS FOR YOU SEE THIS IS ALSO FOR CSU- WE RECOGNIZE THE CALIFORNIA RESIDENT ROLE MEANT. AT UC AND CSU IS A PRIORITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE WE'RE OPEN TO FURTHER DISCUSSION. THE ADMINISTRATION IS INTERESTED IN WORKING WITH UC AND CSU ON WHAT A ROMAN TARGETS COULD LOOK LIKE NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE. AS PRIORITIES FOR THOSE SECONDS. LET ME JUST MAKE A QUICK COMMENT BECAUSE WE JUST HAD A HEARING ON ON THIS LAST WEEK. AND I THINK THE DYNAMICS WERE FASCINATING WHICH IS. THE LEGISLATURE WAS VERY INTERESTED IN- ANNULMENT CAP THE TWO CAMPUSES WITH THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF OUT OF STATE STUDENTS WE HEARD FROM SOME OUT OF STATE STUDENTS THAT DON'T. WANT CHANGES AND WE ALSO HEARD FROM PEOPLE THAT ARE BEING DIVERTED FROM THEIR FIRST CHOICE THAT OUR- KIDS OF CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS. AND SO THE FACT THAT WAS OUT OF STATE STUDENTS IS JUSTIFIED ON THE MONEY IT BRINGS BUT THEN A NUMBER OF IN STATE STUDENTS ARE BEING DIVERTED AWAY FROM THAT AS THEIR FIRST CHOICE. AND SO IT IS ME MOVING PIECES AND IF THERE IS. TO BE SOME CHANGES IN THAT WHICH YOU SEE CLEARLY DIDN'T WANT ONE POINT WE DISCUSSED THIS LAST WEEK ONE OF THE WAYS TO CUSHION THAT IS ADDITIONAL ENROLLMENT GROWTH AND IMPLY THAT IN STATE STUDENTS IN A WAY THAT IT RELEASES THAT PRESSURE SOME MORE SO. THAN JUST MAKE THAT COMMENT AND WE WILL GO TO IT. I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT ALSO ASK QUESTIONS. ABOUT THE- THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. LINE ITEM THAT WAS DISCUSSED BY DO PEOPLE. AND- LET ME GO TO YOU FIRST- YOU MENTIONED IN THE COMMENTS. AN AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATION THAT HAD BEEN IMPLEMENTED THAT WAS ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED ITS OWN LINE ITEM. AT THE TIME OF THAT AUDIT HAS UC IMPLEMENTED ALL OF THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THAT TIME. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SURE LAYERED- UC HAS IMPLEMENTED THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE STATE AUDITOR OF THE ONE RECOMMENDATION BUT THE AUDITOR WOULD LIKE US TO CONTINUE. TO- MOORE IS HAVING THE REGENTS APPROVED A UC ABOUT OPIATE BUDGET. BY MARCH- FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR- FOR THE NEXT YEAR AND BECAUSE THE REGIONS DON'T GET AT THAT TIME HAVE THE INFORMATION AS TO HOW MUCH STATE GENERAL FUND THE SYSTEM WILL HAVE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO DO THAT. YOU SEE REGIONS DO APPROVE A PROPOSED BUDGET FOR YOU C. O. P. H. NOVEMBER- AND WE PUT THAT FORWARD. TO YOU AND TO THE GOVERNOR FOR AS A FUNDING REQUEST. EACH YEAR SO WE ARE PUBLICIZING OUR FINANCIAL NEED AND OUR INTENT AS EARLY AS pDOESN'T GET APPROVED UNTIL AFTER THE LEGISLATURE HAS APPROVED THANK YOU SEE BYE JEFF SO. OUR TIMING WISE STAR SOME ISSUES WITH THAT BUT THE OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS TOP AND- IMPLEMENTED. AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE. JUST BECAUSE- THE MOVE THE LINE ITEM. DID NOT COME FROM THIS HOUSE BUT IF IN FACT- THERE'S GOING TO BE ANY CHANGE A THRESHOLD ISSUE WILL BE. THAT THE AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE TO HAVE BEEN MET SO I THINK. THE ROOM NOT EVEN AT THIS HEARING BUT MAYBE ONE IN THE OTHER HOUSE THAT'S WHERE THAT'S GOING TO BE MUCH MORE OF AN ISSUE. AND INCLUDED. IN THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT IS- AGATE NATURAL RESOURCES A. N. R. AND I ASKED THE QUESTION AT A PREVIOUS HEARING AND GOT A UNSATISFYING ANSWER AND IT REFLECTS ON THIS ISSUE SO LET ME TRY AGAIN. I THINK THE COMMITTEE IS INTERESTED. IN TRYING TO HELP COOPERATIVE AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION THAT GOES THROUGH YOU SEE TO THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. IF THE FUNDING IS BEEN FLAT FOR TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS THERE WERE MAJOR CUTS MADE AT THE TIME OF THE REDUCTIONS AND SO THEY'RE BEEN VACANCIES IN STEP BACKS AND GRADUAL CUTS OVER TIME. AND I THINK THE COMMITTEE IS INTERESTED IN USING THIS ECONOMIC SITUATION TO MOVE AHEAD AND WHEN I PASSED AT A PREVIOUS HEARING AND I WANNA TRY TO PARAPHRASE CORRECTLY. IF WE PUT MONEY IN THE BUDGET FOR THAT PURPOSE HOW WE WERE GUARANTEED IT WOULD GO FOR THAT PURPOSE. THERE WAS NOT A PARTICULARLY SATISFYING ANSWER SO ONLY ASK AGAIN. IF WE WERE TO PUT MONEY IN THE BUDGET. TO TRY TO REHABILITATE- AG COOPERATIVE EXTENSION PROGRAM HOW DO WE KNOW EVERY DOLLAR WE PUT FOR THAT PURPOSE WE'LL GO FOR THAT PURPOSE AND THAT'S TO UC. THANK YOU SIR THE WAY WE GUARANTEE THAT FUNDING WILL GO TO A PARTICULAR PROGRAM IS TO PUT IN- BUDGET BILL TAXED. INTO A BUDGET BILL WE WOULD ALSO REPORT TO YOU ANNUALLY- AND YOU CAN ALSO YOUR STAFF WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THE PUBLIC QUARTERLY REPORTING HAPPENING TO THE REGIONS. ARE ALL YOU SEE ARE YOU C. O. P. PROGRAMS WHICH- THAT REPORTING WILL CONTINUE AND BE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE FOR EVERYONE- BY HAVING. A BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE RATHER THAN A SPECIFIC LINE ITEM BUT DIRECTED LANGUAGE YOU CAN- HAVE PARTICULAR PROGRAMS FUNDED AT ANY LEVEL THAT YOU CHOOSE. AND WE WILL DEFINITELY HEAR YOU ON YOUR WISHES AND ENSURE THAT UC ANR FUNCTIONS ARE FUNDED AT THE LEVEL YOU WANT. THERE ARE TWO POSSIBLE FUNDING MECHANISMS WITHOUT THE LINE ITEM THAT CAN ALSO BE UTILIZED ONE IS THE CAMPUS ASSESSMENT THAT WE UTILIZE PRIOR TO THE LINE ITEM. WE ALSO HAVE SOMETHING CALLED CAMPUS SET ASIDES. THESE ARE PROGRAMS THAT ARE FUNDED SORT OF OFF THE TOP OF THE GENERAL ALLOCATION BEFORE THE FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTED FOR OTHER PURPOSES- WE FIND CERTAIN PROGRAMS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE LEGISLATURE AND TO OUR SYSTEM IN THIS MANNER. FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE PROGRAMS RECEIVE A- SET ASIDE. EACH YEAR TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE FULLY FUNDED- SO DO THE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATIONS SO WE COULD MOVE AT UC ANR TWO EIGHT SET ASIDE. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT. THEY ARE GUARANTEED A CERTAIN LEVEL OF FUNDING. OKAY I THINK OUR STAFF MIGHT WORK WITH YOU ON THAT IT REALLY REFLECTS ON THE ISSUE OF- BOTTOM. OF THE LINE ITEM BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IF WE APPROPRIATE FOR SOMETHING IT GOES FOR SOMETHING. AND SO. YOU KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS YOU JUST SAID TO YOU. AND I'M ALWAYS- A SKEPTIC IN SOME WAYS BECAUSE IT LOOKED LIKE THERE MIGHT BE A COUPLE OF LOOPHOLES IN THERE I JUST WANT TO KNOW FOR SURE. THAT WITH APPROPRIATED FOR PURPOSE IT GOES FOR THE PURPOSE OF WILL HAVE THE STAFF WORK WITH YOU IN CASE STARTS BUDGET LANGUAGE SURE- FULL FURTHER THINGS AND THEN. MAYBE ONE MORE QUESTION BEFORE GOING TO MY COLLEAGUES. MMHM THE THERE WAS THE ISSUE OF I WOULD REFER TO IT AS A WORK STUDY PROGRAM BOOKMARK BASED FINANCIAL AID THAT WAS DISCUSSED- IN MAY BE STARTING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WHY ö BASED FINANCIAL AID A PRIORITY OVER DIRECT GRANT AID. WHY WAS THAT DECISION MADE TO DO IT THAT WAY. SEOUL SAY THAT THIS IS IN COMBINATION WITH CONTINUING TO MAINTAIN THE STATE'S MOST SIGNIFICANT DIRECT AID CAL GRANTS SIX CETERA. THIS IS A SUPPLEMENTARY- PROGRAM THAT WOULD BE AIMED AT THE OVERALL ISSUE OF AFFORDABILITY. SO JUST TO GIVE YOU THE HIGH LEVEL JUSTIFICATION THERE IT'S THAT. BIG PICTURE QUESTION HOW DO YOU TURN ONE TIME. FUNDING WHEN THE STATE ONLY HAS RESOURCES ONE TIME- DOESN'T CAN'T PREDICT THE FUTURE AND MAKE THAT AN ONGOING RESOURCE AND THIS IS AN INNOVATIVE PROPOSAL THAT WOULD WITH THE ENDOWMENT CREATE AN ONGOING PAY OUT. TO STUDENTS IN ALL THE SEGMENTS AND THAT THAT'S OUR- THE ALTERNATIVE OF MAKING SOME ONE TIME INVESTMENT IN DIRECT AID. WOULD ONLY HAVE THAT ONE TIME IMPACT ON ON ONE YEAR OF STUDENTS OR OR YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY ONE COHORT BUT THIS PROPOSAL WAS FRAMED. TO ATTACK THE BIGGER PROBLEM OF AFFORDABILITY AND WE'RE FOCUSED ON THE THAT BIG QUESTION OUT. IN ADDITION TO MAINTAINING AND PROVIDING DIRECT SUBSIDIES THROUGH CAL GRANT THAT ALREADY EXIST HOW DO YOU SUPPLEMENT THAT WITH WITH AN ONGOING RESOURCE. THANK YOU A FREE RESPONSE TO THAT QUESTION AND THIS ALSO IS A THING WE HAD A HEARING ON- LAST WEEK. AND I THINK IT WAS OUR GENERAL DIRECTION. THAT BROADLY REFORMED A CAL GRANT PROGRAM WITH LESS RESTRICTIONS ALLOWING REENTRY STUDENTS ARE EXPEDITED PROCESS ALLOWING FOR- FORK SPENCE'S THAT WEREN'T JUST FEES. WORK ORDER THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF DOING THAT NOW AND I KNOW THAT SME OF IT IS ON GOING MONEY BUT I THINK THAT THE- THE COMMITTEE IS REALLY INTERESTED IN THAT AND SO I MAKE THAT STATEMENT NOW JUST WITH THIS ITEM WE'RE GOING TO BE HEARING THEM STUDENT AID COMMISSION LATER AND- THERE ARE MANY PIECES OF STUDENT AID THAT ARE IN DIFFERENT PARTS. OF THE BUDGET FOR THE THREE BRANCHES BUT I WOULD. CALL THAT OUT AS A AS A CONCERN OF THE COMMITTEE AS AS WE MOVE THROUGH- OTHER THINGS. AND LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE- I'M SORRY I HAVE A- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE RAISED HAND. THANK YOU MR CHAIR BACK OCCURRED DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST TO ADD TO MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS ON THE PROPOSAL ONE OTHER KEY BENEFIT THAT WE SEE THAT THIS PROPOSAL COMPARED TO JUST TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL AID APPROACHES IS BECAUSE IT OFFERS LEARNING ALIGNED EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES PARTICULARLY GEARED TO UNDER REPRESENTED OR FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS. IT'S OFFERING WORKFORCE CONNECTIONS TO THE STUDENTS THAT THEY MAY NOT OTHERWISE ENCOUNTER OR HAVE AS NATURALLY AS THEIR FIRST GENERATION STUDENT FROM AN UNDERREPRESENTED GROUP. NUMBER WANTED PRITCHARD THAT COMMENT I THINK IT DOES IT NEGATE WHAT I JUST SAID THAT MAYBE IN FACT. WE DO IT ALL. GIVEN THE FACT THAT THERE'S ONE TIME MONEY SO IT IS REALLY THE BROADER DIRECT STUDENT AID AND THEN WORK OPPORTUNITIES AND THE BENEFITS THAT COME FROM THAT BUT I THINK WE- THIS IS A ONCE IN A GENERATION OPPORTUNITY TO REFORM THE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM IN. IT AND I DON'T WANT TO DO IT AROUND THE EDGES OF SO WE WILL SEE WHERE WE GET BUT I APPRECIATE THAT COMMENT. I WAS GONNA GO TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR QUESTIONS- WHO- CENTER ROAD SCHAUMBURG AND THEN SENATOR MEANT. GOOD MORNING. I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE U. C. M. CAN YOU CAN USE THE COMMON UNDER CONSIDERATION OF INCREASING TUITION BEGINNING FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO I'M CURIOUS AS TO THE OUTSTANDING FUNDS NEEDED TO- FINDING. NEEDS GIVEN THE MAY REVISION FOR THE UPCOMING YEAR- PROVIDES APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED SIX MILLION IN UNDERGOING FUNDS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR UC REGENTS ARE CONSIDERING A NEW TUITION FINANCING MODEL CALLED COVERT BASED TUITION WHICH WOULD ENSURE THAT WHILE ENROLLED NO YOU SEE STUDENT WOULD SEE THEIR FEES INCREASED. THE FEES WOULD INCREASE- BEFORE THE STUDENT AND ROLLS AND THEY WOULD KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE COST OF THEIR EDUCATION WOULD BE. MODEL HAS NOT YET BEEN ADOPTED NOR ARE HAS TUITION BEEN INCREASED OR- OR FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO THAT IS STILL BEING CONSIDERED AND THE MODEL MAY BE ADOPTED WITHOUT RAISING TUITION AS WELL- THE INTENT OF THE MODEL IS TO PROVIDE CERTAINTY TO STUDENTS FALL THEY'RE INVOLVED AT THEIR FEES WOULD NOT INCREASE. AND IT WOULD BE- ALSO INCREASE THE FINANCIAL AID AVAILABLE TO OUR POOREST STUDENTS TO HELP THEM KEEP UP WITH THE COST OF LIVING SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO TAKE OUT MORE LOANS TO LONGER THERE ARE GOLD- IF I CAN ASK A FOLLOW UP QUESTION IT. JUST FOR A MOMENT BECAUSE I THINK. THE CALL WAS JUST ABOUT THE MODEL AND IN DEFENSE OF YOU EE. THE DISCUSSION OF TUITION WAS INITIATED ON THE AGENDA BEFORE ANYBODY KNEW WHAT TO MAY REVISE ADDITIONAL FUNDING WAS GOING TO BE I THINK THE QUESTION IS. SORT OF WHY RAISE TUITION. A WITH ALL THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT'S BASE LEVEL FUNDING THAT'S COMING FROM THE STATE FOR UC IT. THANK YOU SIR FOR THE CLARIFICATION- IF YOU SEE WAS TO RECEIVE SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO COVER OUR COSTS FOR OPERATING INCREASES FOR. THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE YEAR WE MAY NOT HAVE NEED TO RAISE TUITION AND THOSE DECISIONS MAY BE PUT OFF- FURTHER INTO THE FUTURE AND THEN THAT. LEADS TO THE OPENING OF WHAT IS ADEQUATE FUNDING TO DIVERT THAT DO YOU BELIEVE THAT WHAT'S IN THE MAY REVISE IS ADEQUATE. TO NOT. TO HANDLE THE BASE FUNDING EXPENSES TO NOT GO TO THE REGIONS FOR TUITION INCREASE- IT IS FORTY EIGHT TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO PER YEAR WHICH COVERS- ARE. ARE REQUESTED MOST OF OUR REQUESTED INVESTMENTS AND ALL OF OUR MANDATORY COST INCREASES- BUT FOUR D. TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE FISCAL YEAR AT THE UNIVERSITY WILL HAVE. YET ANOTHER SET OF MANDATORY COST INCREASES THAT WILL DISCUSS NEXT YEAR WITH YOU AND HOPEFULLY THE STATE'S REVENUES WILL CONTINUE TO BE ROBUST AND TUITION INCREASE SAYS- DO YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE UNDERTAKEN OR CAN BE REVERSED. SO THOSE STUDENTS ARE NOT PERMITTED IN ANY WAY- THE LEGISLATURE HAS IN PRIOR YEARS BOUGHT OUT YOU SEIZED- TUITION INCREASES AREN'T WHAT ME THANK MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR TROUBLED FOR LETTING ME DO THAT FOLLOW UP AND CLARIFICATION WILL GO BACK TO HER. FOR A REMAINING QUESTIONS. THIS IS WHY TRUST EXPERTISE IN YOUR- AND- LAYERED YOU CAN COME IN AT ANY TIME. FOR CLARIFICATION PURPOSES. AND I DO HAVE A QUESTION WITH REGARDS TO- THE MANY ITEMS THAT WE ARE- FINANCING- IN ARGENTA- THE ON GOING AND THE ONE TIME FUNDING AND SO FORTH. I'M KIND OF YOURS AND I BELIEVE THIS MAY BE A QUESTION FOR THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WITH REGARDS TO ACCOUNTABILITY SO THE STATE IS INVESTING A LOT OF MONEY IN THESE PROGRAMS HOW DOES THE STATE HAD TO DO WITH THE LEGISLATURE- FOLLOW UP AND MAKE SURE THAT. THESE FINDINGS ARE- SPENT THE WAY THAT THEY ARE BEING APPROPRIATED IS THERE ANY- TOOLS OR ANYTHING IN SUCH A THAT WILL HAVE IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THAT ACCOUNTABILITY. MOVING FORWARD SAY IN A YEAR TWO YEARS WHEN WE HAVE A REPORT OR DO WE HAVE A REPORT THAT COMES BACK AND SAYS OKAY THIS IS HOW WE SPEND THE MONEY. YEAH THAT'S A- THAT'S A KEY QUESTION OF THE LEGISLATURE FACES EVERY YEAR- WHAT'S THAT SO LOOK THERE TWO WAYS REALLY THE LEGISLATURE HAS TO ENSURE THE FUNDS ARE OURS STANDS- THE WAITING TENS AND IDEALLY THE LEGISLATURE DOES BOTH THE FIRST IS TO SPECIFY PROVISIONS IN THE BUDGET BILL ITSELF THAT DIRECT- FOR EXAMPLE YOU SEE HOW TO SPEND THE FUNDS- AND THEN THE SECOND- TOOL TO THE LEGISLATURE HAS. IS REPORTING- AFTER THAT- INITIATIVE HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED- USUALLY DOES SUBMIT A NUMBER OF REPORTS BUT FOR A LOT OF THESE NEW INITIATIVES PARTICULARLY ONE TIME INITIATIVES- IN ORDER TO GET INFORMATION YOU NEED TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OTHERWISE THERE THERE WON'T BE- AUTOMATIC REPORTING TO THE LEGISLATURE- THE REGIONS DO- OVERSIGHT HEARINGS SO SOMETIMES THESE. INITIATIVES ARE DISCUSSED IN THE BOARD OF REGENTS AND- THOSE pLEGISLATURE ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO HOLD AN INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS IN FUTURE YEARS ON THESE INITIATIVES. I'M ALSO MANY INITIATIVES IN THE BUDGET OBVIOUSLY THAT CAN BE THAT CAN BE QUITE CHALLENGING- TO DO ON EVERY ITEM SO I TYPICALLY REPORTING LANGUAGE ON THIS PRETTY KEY THERE. WHEN IT COMES TO REPORTING LANGUAGE. SOMETIMES THERE'S A TEMPTATION TO HAVE REPORTING LANGUAGE BE VERY BOILER PLATE. A VERY SIMPLISTIC BUT- USUALLY IT'S HELPFUL TO THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVES THAT- THIS INITIATIVE IS TRYING TO ADDRESS AND THEN THINKING ABOUT WHICH OUTCOMES- UNIVERSITY COULD REPORT THAT- ENSURE THE LEGISLATURE'S TRACKING THAT THOSE ULTIMATE UTCOMES WERE MET. SO THERE ARE SOME OF THE TOOLS AVAILABLE TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND I'M ASSUMING THAT WILL START. WHEN DO WE START. REQUIRING THAT LANGUAGE SHOULD BE ADAM. WELL WE COULD DO LANGUAGE AS PART OF THE BUDGET APPROVAL IF THAT'S WHAT WE WANTED TO DO AND I THINK THAT THAT CENTER ROAD TROUBLE RAISES A REALLY REALLY GOOD ISSUE BECAUSE AS WE MOVE BROADER IN THIS BUDGET. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S SOME TRANSPARENCY AND HOW THINGS ARE BEING SPENT AND WHETHER IT'S ACHIEVING WHAT WAS REPRESENTED IN THE BUDGET AND- NORMALLY WE DO OVERSIGHT AND NORMALLY THERE CAN BE CERTAIN REPORTS I THINK WE JUST HAVE TO DECIDE IF WE WANT TO ASK FOR SPECIFIC REPORTS. FOR WHITE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS OR FIGURE OUT WHAT WE WANT TO DO BUT IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION AND I THINK. I'LL TALK TO THE STAFF ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE DONE THERE. THANK YOU THE SECOND PLEASE YOUR QUESTIONS SENATOR MEN. THANK YOU TURN ALERT- I GUESS I WANT TO START BY JUST. APPLAUDING IT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR I KNOW OF AND- PRIORITIES I THINK- RESTORATION OF IN IN AUGMENT I'VE THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE- I ALSO WOULD COMMAND ALL- HIGHLIGHTING THE IMPORTANT ISSUE OF ANTI ASIAN HATE. I DO WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF CHAIR LAYERED ON DO YOU SEE IN OUR PROGRAMS- IT TRANSPARENCY IS IMPORTANT AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE ALL DEALING WITH THIS IS. YOU KNOW WHETHER I'S THE ELIMINATION OF THE U. COP LINE ITEM. WHETHER IT'S- YOU KNOW TRYING TO ALLOCATE FUNDS FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSE HAPPEN HOW DO WE KNOW IS MY COLLEAGUE- CENTER TO A TO A BOOK HE SAID. THAT THAT THESE FUNDS ARE BEING. USED FOR THEIR INTENDED PURPOSES IN AN EFFICIENT WAY. OF DOING THAT I JUST HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS- FIRST ON THE ONE BILLION DOLLAR ENDOWMENT. I SEE THE PURPOSE OF THIS IT'S I THINK VERY INTERESTING INNOVATIVE AS YOUSAID AND AS A FORMER LAW PROFESSOR. I KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF WORK BASED EXPERIENCE INTERNSHIPS EXTERNSHIPS AND ALLIED- I GUESS MY MAIN QUESTION AND I THINK SENATOR. LAYER TO GOT TO THIS A LITTLE BIT. BUT TO WHAT DEGREE IS THIS DUPLICATIVE OF EXISTING PROGRAMS AND I GUESS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I KNOW THAT STUDENTS IN THE UC'S WHETHER THEIR UNDERGRADS AND GRAD STUDENTS. OUR OUR GUEST AT SEA TRYING TO NAVIGATE THROUGH ALL THE DIFFERENT AID PROGRAMS ALL THE DIFFERENT- PROGRAMS THAT THEY CAN ACCESS. AND IT CAN BE QUITE CONFUSING FOR THEM THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS THE RESOURCES WITHIN THE CAMPUSES TO CONNECT UP STUDENTS WITH THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF AID THAT THEY MIGHT RECEIVE. I ALSO KNOW THAT EVERY TIME YOU CREATE NEW PROGRAM- YOU HAVE MORE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS WHICH TAP INTO THAT EFFECTIVELY CREATING A TAX ON. THE PHONE SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS TO WHAT DEGREE IS THIS APPROACH- DUPLICATIVE OF OTHER PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE FUNDING FOR A PERIL EITHER PARALLEL PURPOSES OR THIS EXACT PURPOSE OF FUNDING INTERNSHIPS AND EXTERNSHIPS. AND I'LL BE BY YOUR QUESTION FOR DEPARTMENT FINANCE AND ALSO DO YOU SEE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR MEANT. SO THE FROMOUR PERSPECTIVE THIS IS NOT TO PUT IT IN FOR IT IS DESIGNED TO PARALLEL THE EXISTING FEDERAL WORK STUDY PROGRAM. THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE FEDERAL WORK STUDY PROGRAM HAS A- A BROADER CAME. BY SO OUR OUR PROGRAM THE STATE FUNDED VERSION WOULD FOCUS YOU HAVE TO BE AN UNDERREPRESENTED BACKGROUND- AS A STUDENT- WHERE IS THE FEDERAL IS FOCUSED MORE ON DEMONSTRATED FINANCIAL NEED. OURS WOULD ALSO PRIORITIZE STEM MAJORS AND STEM- EMPLOYERS. DID THE OTHER KEY DIFFERENCE HERE AND THIS IS THE ROOT OF THE WHY HAVE THIS PROGRAM AT ALL IT'S THAT THE FEDERAL WORK STUDY- TARGETS ONE ISSUE WHICH IS. IF YOU'RE A STUDENT HI AND YOU YOU'RE ENTERING AS A FRESHMAN. AND YOU WORK WITH THE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM MADE YOU THE IS PACKAGE AND YOU SHOULD TRY TO WORK EXPERTS. TOWARDS EUROPE OF CONTRA. YOU CAN THAT FINANCE AID FOR THAT THEY YOU. YOU SAW UP ARE YOU WORK IN THE LIBRARY FOR FIFTEEN TWENTY HOURS A WEEK- AND THAT HELPS YOUR YOUR FINANCIAL SITUATION. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TAKE THAT WHEN YOU'RE CONTRIBUTING TO YOUR FINANCIAL AID- CONTRIBUTION AS AS DESIGNED BY THE FINANCIAL AID ADMINISTRATORS WITH YOU. WE DON'T WANT THAT JUST TO BE YOU'RE GETTING AN HOURLY WAGE WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT SO THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY LINKED UP WITH AN EMPLOYER THAT'S EITHER IN YOUR MAJOR OR- OR IT HAS INDICATED TO THE UC CAMPUS THAT THEY'RE POTENTIALLY GOING TO HIRE FUTURE UC GRADUATES. SO WE'RE TRYING TO LINK THE HOURLY WAGE WITH ALSO LONGER TERM CAREER DEVELOPMENT. SIEVE IF THAT'S ENOUGH I COULD STOP THERE BUT YET LET ME REPHRASE MY QUESTION BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND YEAH THIS ISN'T NOT MEANT TO BE FOR STUDIES IS NOT WORKING IN THE LIBRARY OR THE CAFETERIA. IT'S ABOUT INTERNSHIPS AND EXTERNSHIPS AS THEIR FAMILIARLY KNOWN AS IS MY UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOUR PRODUCT HERE IS. I GUESS I JUST QUESTION- BLUNTLY IS. WATER PROGRAMS ALREADY EXIST STATEWIDE AND SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S NONE AND THEN AT THE DIFFERENT CAMPUSES WHERE I KNOW THERE ARE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR INTERNSHIPS AND EXTERNSHIPS. YOU KNOW HAVE YOU MAPPED THAT OUT TO WHAT DEGREE DOES THIS TACK ON TO THOSE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS- YOU KNOW I JUST DON'T HAVE A SENSE I KNOW THAT MY FORMER EMPLOYER. YOU SEE AROUND SCHOOL LAW WE HAD DIFFERENT PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR INTERNSHIPS AND EXTERNSHIPS. FOR SOME STUDENTS I DON'T HAVE A SENSE OF THE SCALE OF THAT OUTSIDE OF LAW SCHOOL. OR CERTAINLY OUTSIDE OF THE UC IRVINE CAMPUS BUT I GUESS THAT'S MY QUESTION- THAT'S YET THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION I WOULD SAY WE DEFINITELY TAKE YOUR POINT THAT. PER CAMPUS THERE'S A RANGE OF VARIOUS INTERNET EXTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIES. THE KEY DIFFERENCE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AND WHY THIS WOULD BE NECESSARY IS THAT. WHEN YOU HAVE A FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE THROUGH THE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM- THOUGH DOES INTERNSHIPS AND EX EXTERNSHIP CAN OFTEN BE A SEPARATE FROM THE DESIGN OF THAT PACKAGE. AND SO THE IDEA HERE IS THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE BUILT IN O. YOUR AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH YEAR YOU'RE WORKING WITH THE FINANCIAL AID OFFICE TO SAY YOU'RE GONNA RECEIVE EXPEL GRANT X. CETERA- AND THEN. THEY'RE GONNA HELP ALIGN YOU WITH THIS PROGRAM AND THAT'S GOING TO CONTRIBUTE PART OF YOUR OVERALL- FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE AS YOUR YOUR WORK STUDY CONTRIBUTION. SO THAT'S JUST IT'S A MORE OF A CLOSE LINKAGE BETWEEN THE OVERALL EXISTING FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM. THEN IT EXISTS WITH NECESSARILY ALL OF THE INDIVIDUAL. IT'S OUR OPPORTUNITY SET UP FRONT. ASSESSOR FOR UP FRONT- OFFERING RATHER THAN SORT OF SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS EACH SUMMER I TAKE IT. GREAT YEAH YEAH I GUESS THAT'S THE THEME IS MORE IT'S GREATER IT'S BETTER ALIGNS TO FINANCIAL AID ADMINISTRATION. GOT IT. I I'M NOT SURE ANY DAY I THINK YOU ANSWERED MY QUESTION BUT IF THE YOU SEE HAS ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. OKAY. MY SECOND QUESTION YOU HAVE INTERESTING AND I THINK- YOU KNOW IMPORTANT RESEARCH PRIORITIES THAT YOU ALLOCATE ONE TIME FUNDING FOR HERE I'M TALKING DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- YOU GOT ANIMAL SHELTERS DYSLEXIA ALTERNATIVE MEAT AND I THINK A FEW OTHERS. I GUESS MY QUESTION IS HOW WERE THESE RESEARCH PRIORITIES CHOSEN. OVER ANY OTHER PRIORITY AND- I GUESS GIVEN YOU KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF FIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE AND WILDFIRES RIGHT NOW WHY WERE THESE SAYING A COLLECTED AND NOT GIVEN RESEARCH FINDING WHERE I THINK RESEARCH IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT FOR THESE PARTICULAR AREAS. ARE AND WHY WERE SOME OF THESE OTHER ONES SELECTED. I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION ALL ALL I CAN'T SPEAK RESPECTFULLY TO WHAT'S NOT WHAT'S NOT HERE SO. NO NO CLEAR JUSTIFICATION WE'RE NOT GOING TO JUSTIFY WHY IT'S NOT. IN HERE BUT THE- THE HOW WERE THESE SHOWS AND THESE ARE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PRIORITIES. CIVICALLY THE EASIEST TO POINT TO IS THE ANIMAL SHELTER GRANT PROGRAM. WE HAD PROPOSED THAT LAST YEAR. DUE TO THE TWENTY TWENTY COMPLEXITY. WE DIDN'T MANAGE TO REACH THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF GETTING A FULLY FUNDED GRANT PROGRAM. SO THAT'S BACK IN HERE OF COURSE THE- IS AN AMERICAN STUDIES CENTER THAT WAS A UNIDENTIFIED NEED THAT'S BEEN EXACERBATED RECENTLY AND SO THAT'S SPEAKING TO THAT- AND THE SAME WITH DYSLEXIA IS AN ESTABLISHED ADMINISTRATION PRIORITY. ABOUT THE RESTORATION OF LOTS OF PRIORITIES I GUESS- YEAH YEAH I GUESS MY QUESTION WRIT LARGE AS WOULD HAVE BEEN. PERHAPS MORE EFFICIENT THEY JUST SAID WE WANT TO FIND X. AMOUNT OF DOLLARS FOR GENERAL RESEARCH ON WHAT THE UC'S DECIDE WHERE THAT'S BEST. THE PURPOSE. I WOULD SAY THIS IS JUST A CASE OF US TRYING TO BE SPECIFIC IT AND PRIORITIZE THE ADMINISTRATION'S- PRIORITIES SO THEY'RE THEY'RE REPRESENTED IN THESE THESE ARE PROPOSALS. I APPRECIATE THAT I ONE LAST QUICK QUESTION BECAUSE JUST BEFORE YOU GO TO THAT QUICK QUESTION LET ME ADD. A COMMENT. SENATOR AND THAT IS I WAS VISITED BY REPRESENTATIVES FOR TRULY A BY REPRESENTATIVES OF UC BERKELEY LAST WEEK. BECAUSE THEY'RE SEEKING IN THE CLIMATE CENTER TO DO WILD FIRE RESEARCH AND ESTABLISH SORT OF A WILDFIRE SECTION AND THEY WERE. SUGGESTING THAT NINE MILLION DOLLARS OF STATE MONEY MIGHT BE REALLY HELPFUL TO MATCH TO OTHER NINE MILLION DOLLARS THAT MIGHT BE COMING IN AND SO- YOUR POINT IS REALLY WITH MERIT BECAUSE THEY'RE COMING AT US WITH WITH DIFFERENT THINGS EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT NOT BE INCLUDED IN THIS AND IF THERE WERE. MORE GLOBAL LOOK RESEARCH AND THEN. WE COULD ACTUALLY DIRECT THEM TO THEM RATHER THAN COMING TO US BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN IN THEIR BUDGET THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL SO I THINK THAT WAS IT. A GOOD GENERAL DIRECTION THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME MAKE THAT COME IN AND YOU HAD AN ADDITIONAL QUESTION- AND THEN JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON YOU WHAT YOU SAID YOUR LETTER I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THE ADMINISTRATION HERE'S- PICKING WINNERS AND- I GUESS BY. DEFAULT PICKING LOSERS AS WELL AND- YOU KNOW TO WHAT DEGREE SHOULD THE STATE SENATE'SPRIORITIES ALSO MAP ON TO THIS- PARTICULAR BUDGET IS A QUESTION BUT- I THINK THAT'S QUESTION FOR ANOTHER DAY- MY LAST QUESTION IS GOING BACK. TO THE BILLION DOLLAR ENDOWMENT. DO YOU SEE RIGHT. RACE TAKE. AROUND I AM FORGETTING FOR A DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS. THAT THIS MIHT RAISE CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS HAVE YOU HAVE YOU LOOKED INTO THIS AND ASSISTED IN FORMING A FINANCE OBVIOUSLY. WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK I HEARD IT. WE APPRECIATE THE ALL SAY THAT ON THAT POINT IN TERMS OF OTHER DETAILS ABOUT THE PROGRAM WE ARE WORKING NOW WITH YOU SEE. AND WE'RE WE'LL WORK THROUGH THOSE ISSUES. OKAY WELL CONSTITUTION PROBABLY CAN'T BE WORKED THROUGH BUT BUT HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET A GOOD OUTCOME I THINK SO MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR MAN AND THANK EVERYBODY ON THIS PANEL ONLY MAKE A BRIEF COMMENT WHICH IS THAT- THERE WAS SO MUH IN HERE AND WE HAVE SUCH A PACKAGE AND- THAT WE MIGHT NOT HAVE GOTTEN TO EVERYTHING THAT WAS A MAJOR ISSUE OF CONCERN AND IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE MIGHT NOT WANT TO STILL HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND DECIDE. TO DO WORK TOWARD TO GO SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY AS WE MOVE INTO THE NEGOTIATIONS TO SHUT DOWN THE BUDGET- IT'S JUST THAT- MORE ALREADY WAY BEHIND- PART TIME BUT IT- AND WE WILL HAVE TO TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END AND SO I JUST WANTED TO I THANK MY COLLEAGUES BECAUSE I THINK WE GOT A LOT OF THE HIGH LEVEL ISSUES THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK FRANTICALLY AND UNLIMITD NUMBER OF DAYS WE HAVE LEFT TO CLOSE DOWN SOME OF THESE ISSUES. SO WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE WHICH IS MAY REVISION PROPOSALS FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM THE PANEL'S JENNIFER LOUIS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OR LEASE A KING FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND RUN STORM FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AND WE DO HAVE FOUR MORE ITEMS INCLUDING THIS ONE SO I'M GOING TO TRY TO JUST HAVE PEOPLE BE DISCIPLINED THE RESPONSE IS GOING FOR. SO WHAT STAR WITH JENNIFER LOUISE- AND WE'LL GO IN THE ORDER I JUST MENTIONED WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE SO AGAIN I MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS INCLUDE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE NEIGHBOR VISION PROVIDES NINETY NINE POINT FOUR MILLION ONGOING AND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND RESOURCES TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM WHICH INCLUDES A BASE AUGMENTATION OF SEVENTY FOUR POINT. FOUR MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND. THE MAIN. ALSO PROVIDES THE FOLLOWING AND- FOR HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLION A ONE TIME GENERAL AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION ONGOING GENDER FUND. TO SUPPORT TRANSITIONING YES YOU HUMBLE TOOK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY. AND THE SECOND ITEM IS TWENTY FIVE MILLION ONE HUNDRED OFF I JUST SUPPORT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE STATE AS YOU NORTHRIDGE CENTER FOR EQUITY AND INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY. AS WELL AS A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION ONE TIMEFEDERAL CORONA VIRUS CAPITAL PROJECT FUNDS. TO THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO SUPPORT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. AS WELL AS THE REMOVAL OF THE SUSPENSION DATE FOR SUMMER TERM FINANCIAL AID THEREBY CONTROLLING CONTINUING THE SIX MILLION ANNUAL AUGMENTATION FOR THE PROGRAM. ON AN ONGOING BASIS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR IMPROVED PER SHARE. COMMENTS- HELLO. MORNING SENATORS BE SEEKING I JUST ANALYST'S OFFICE. INTERESTED TIME ALSO BECAUSE I'M JUST A FEW OF THE MAJOR PROPOSALS FIRST YES YOU. STARTING WITH THE BASE AUGMENTATION. IN A PREVIOUS KENNEL MY COLLEAGUE JASON CONSTANT CARS RACING ISSUS FOR THE- SUBCOMMITTEE TO CONSIDER REGARDING YOU SEE SPACE AUGMENTATION AND BY AND LARGE THOSE SAME ISSUES APPLY HERE. MUCH LIKE UCCS YOUR FACES CERTAIN OPERATING COST INCREASES IN THE BUDGET HERE SUCH AS EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND I THINK IT'S ALSO A NEW STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS. DOES COST ESTIMATED TO TOTAL FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING AND SO WE WAIT. FOR SUCH SUCH A TREAT AT FIFTY SEVEN MILLION AS A STARTING POINT TO MINIMUM AMOUNT BASED ON MEDITATION TO PROVIDE. A LIST PROVIDED FURTHER AUGMENTATION ON TOP OF THAT IT COULD EXPECT YES YOU USE THOSE FUNDS ON ON PRESIDENTIAL HIRING OR OTHER CSU PRIORITIES. SUCH AS THE GRADUATION INSTEAD OF. FINANCE NOTED ALSO A PURPLE TO FIND A TRANSIT. TO A POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY AT HUMBOLDT STATE. THIS TRANSITION WOULD HAVE NOTABLE IMPLICATIONS FOR CAMPUSES COURSE OFFERINGS ENROLLMENTS OPERATIONS. ALSO ITS ROLE WITHIN THE BROADER CSU SYSTEM. OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE CAMPUS IS CURRENTLY CONDUCTING A SELF STUDY REGARDING THIS TRANSITION AND THAT IT IS CURRENTLY EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETE THE SEPTEMBER. GIVEN THAT LACK OF INFORMATION LEGISLATURE CURRENTLY HAS A PROPOSAL WE THINK IT WOULD BE PREMATURE TO FUND THIS PROPOSAL BEFORE THE SELF STUDY IS COMPLETE AND AVAILABLE FOR REVIEW. AT SOME RECOMMEND REJECTING THIS TIME ACTUALLY VISITING IN THE FUTURE. WE DID ALSO JUST WANT TO RAISE SOME COMMENTS SPECIFIC TO THE CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE HUMBLE PROPOSALS FOR DUEL SENIOR GENDER LISTED BOTTOM. LINE THE TOPIC PAGE TIME. THE TWO LARGEST CAPITAL PROJECTS AS PART OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE FOR STUDENT HOUSING. FINDING THESE PROJECTS WOULD BE A DEPARTURE FROM THE STATE'S CURRENT PRACTICE OF FUNDING MACROGENICS IS ALREADY IS THE UNIVERSITY IS WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT HOUSING DINING AND OTHER SOFTWARE PROGRAMS. I'LL BE SOUGHT SUPPORT SOMEBODY'S. THERE IS ALSO SOME FUNDING IN THIS PACKAGE THAT WAITED OUT INSTRUCTIONAL SPACE AT THE HUMBLE CAMPUS HERE WOULD KNOW THAT THAT CURRENT UTILIZATION RATES OF EXISTING. CUSTOMERS FACES IN THE CAMPUS ARE RELATIVELY LOW. THESE ARE THE TYPES OF ISSUES THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD WANT TO CONSIDER WHAT YOUR READERS OF THIS PROPOSAL TRANSLITERATED. REGARDING THE CENTER FOR EQUITY INNOVATION TECHNOLOGY AT CSU NORTHRIDGE THIS PROPOSAL WOULD CONSTRUCT A NEW BUILDING. BUILDING BUT INCLUDES A SPACE FOR OUTREACH TO YOUNGER STUDENTS INCLUDING IN THE K. TWELVE AREA AND AS WELL AS AN ADDITIONAL LAB SPACE FOR THE COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCE. SURE WE WOULD ENCOURAGE LEGISLATURE TO AWAIT US ARMONK ITS OTHER PRIORITIES FOR CAPITAL OUTLAYS YES YOU. IF YOU HAS THAT SUBSTANTIAL DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG OF ABOUT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL. INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS RELATING TO LIKE SAFETY CONCERNS AND- CAMPUS WIDE OPERATIONS. AND SO I JUST I DON'T WANT TO WAIT THAT BENEFITS OF CREATING. NEW BUILDINGS CONSTRUCTING NEW BUILDINGS AGAINST ADDRESSES DEFICIENCIES. IN EXISTING BUILDINGS AND INFRASTRUCTURE. WHICH IS THE LAST TOPIC THAT I WANTED TO RAISE WHICH IS A DIFFERENT MAINTENANCE. THE GOVERNOR'S DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROPOSAL IN THEIR VISION WOULD BRING THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR THIS PURPOSE I HAVE MANY REVISION TO THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION ONGOING I'M SORRY ONE TIME IN THE BUDGET YEAR- GIVEN THE SIZE IS SIX YEARS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG AS WELL AS THAT RESPECT THESE COSTS COULD. GROW OVER TIME TO FIND A DRESSED WE THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER THIS AS A STARTING POINT AND- BUT WANT TO FIGHT IT AND BASED. ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED. FOR DIFFERENT PROJECTS. THANK YOU I'D BE HAPPY TAKING QUESTION BEFORE A GRAND TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE REPRESENTATIVE OF CSU. GOOD MORNING SENATORS. I'M RYAN STORM REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. I'LL TALK ABOUT THREE ISSUES FIRST THE BASE AUGMENTATION WE'RE THANKFUL TO THE GOVERNOR FOR THE RESTORATION OF THAT TWO HUNDRED NINETY NINE MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET CUT FROM LAST YEAR. FIGHTING ANOTHER SEVENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TO OUR BASE TO HELP ELIMINATE THOSE EQUITY GAPS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT OVER THE SPRING- IN IN IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR PRO OVERALL PROGRAM THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THIS MONEY WILL ALSO ALLOW US MANDATORY COST INCREASES IN PARTICULAR ITEMS LIKE EMPLOYEE HEALTH CARE COST INCREASES OCCUR EACH YEAR SO GRATEFUL FOR THAT THANK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THAT. ON HOW BOLD WE WELCOME THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR A THIRD POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY AT THE HUMBOLDT STATE CAMPUS. THE CREATION OF A POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY ON THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COAST WILL PROVIDE MORE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES IN THE REGION. HER STUDENTS FOR IN DEMAND CAREERS. IN THE NORTH COAST REGION AND THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA ALTERNATELY TO. AND LASTLY ON DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WE WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS PROPOSAL TO USE A STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS TO ADDRESS THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS. BUT WE ALSO URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDS. TO ELIMINATE HELP ELIMINATE THE BACKLOG OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS THAT WILL ALSO HELP WITH ENROLLMENT HOUSING NEEDS AIR CIRCULATION UPGRADES AND OTHER VITAL PROJECTS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO QUESTIONS. IN LET ME ASK FINANCE THE SAME QUESTION I ASKED YOU SEE WHICH IS- THE RATIONALE FOR KEEPING ENROLLMENT FLAT AT CSU WERE NOT FUNDING AND ROAM ACROSS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT SIMILARLY FOR THAT QUESTION- JENNIFER LU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- AS I PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED BY MY COLLEAGUE. AND FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ON THE MAY REVISION DOES NOT SO THIS VIRAL MOMENT TARGETS FOR BOTH THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AND- THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA- HOWEVER WE DO RECOGNISE THAT CALIFORNIA RESIDENT ROWLEY IS A PRIORITY AND TO THE LEGISLATURE AND WE'RE OPEN TO FURTHER DISCUSSION AS WE MOVE ON. WITH THAT- BUT YOUR PROCESS AND THE ADMINISTRATION IS INTERESTED IN WORKING WITH BOTH SEGMENTS OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AND UNIVERSITY HEALTH RAN ON WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER IT'S LOOK LIKE AND NOW IN IN THE FUTURE AS PART OF A DISCUSSION OF PARTIES ARE FOR BOTH SEGMENTS OKAY THANK YOU MY APPRECIATE THAT RESPONSE AND I'M SURE WILL. ENJOY HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT WHAT ME ASK A RELATED QUESTION OF- CSU. AND THAT DOES YES YOU IS HAD PROGRAM AND I'M- BECAUSE THE NAME ESCAPES. RIGHT NOW. TO ELEVATE THE PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS THAT GO THROUGH AND FOR YEARS AND THE PERCENTAGE SYSTEM WIDE HAS GONE UP IN A MEASURABLE WAY WHICH THEN. I H. MORE MOMENT SPACES BECAUSE PEOPLE MOVING THROUGH IN FOUR YEARS. WITH THE OR I WAS GONNA ASK WHAT THE STATUS IS OF THAT PROGRAM AND I KNOW THAT IN THE PAST. THERE'S BEEN A SPECIFIC ALLOCATION FOR IT IS THAT PROGRAM. COVERED ADEQUATELY UNDER THE- ADDITIONAL FUNDS IN THE MAY REVISION FOR CSU. THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERED FOR THAT QUESTION THE PROGRAM IS CALLED THE GRADUATION IS SHIPPED TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IT'S A SIX YEAR LONG ENDEAVOR OF. CREASING OUR- BASE BUDGET BY ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. IN AGGREGATE SO THAT'S BEEN A- I THINK WE ARE NOW- FOR THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO YEAR WE ARE IN THE FIFTH YEAR OF ATTEMPTING TO FULLY FUND OUR PROPOSAL WHAT THAT DOES IS THAT THE DAY HAS A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT. HIGH LEVEL GOALS ARE MANY SUB LEVEL GOALS ASSOCIATE BUT I'LL KEEP A VERY HIGH LEVEL FOR BREVITY'S SAKE ULTIMATELY- WHEN THE MAJOR GOALS IS TO INCREASE GRADUATION RATES WRIT LARGE. AND SO FAR THE PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN SUCCESS- WE'VE GONE FROM A FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE IN AT 19% BACK IN. BACK AT THE START OF THE INITIATIVE AND WE ARE AT THIRTY ONE FOR R. 31% FOR A FIRST TIME FRESHMEN YOU SEE SIMILAR SORTS OF INCREASES FOR OUR ALL OF OUR- ETHNIC GROUPS OF OUR STUDENTS. YOU SEE THAT IN TERMS OF FRESHMEN AND TRANSFER GRADUATION RATES ALL OF THOSE POSTS HAVE HAVE RISEN AND SO THAT'S A REALLY GOOD THING. I THINK THE ONE THING THAT WE STILL CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH IS NEARING WHAT WE CALL THE EQUITY GAP. WHICH IS WHERE- YES I. IF YOU KNOW ALL OF US. ALL OF OUR STUDENTS ARE PEOPLE AND WE WANT ALL STUDENTS TO GRADUATE AT THE SAME RATES ULTIMATELY. RIGHT AND SO THAT'S THE GOAL IN IN IN IN IN THE CASE OF THE C. ISSUE WE HAVE DIFFERENT RATES OF PROGRESS BETWEEN YOUR M. STUDENTS. AND MORE TRADITIONAL STUDENTS- I MEAN THE STUDENTS THAT ARE WHITE OR ASIAN DESCENT. THERE'S A GAP BETWEEN THOSE TWO. AND IN SOME INSTANCES ON CAMPUSES ARE CAMPUSES THAT NARROW THAT GAP COMPLETE OTHER CASES THEY HAVEN'T SYSTEM WIDE WE HAVE A AN OVERALL GAP. IN TERMS OF YOUR M. STUDENTS AS WELL AS AND INTEL GRANT ELIGIBLE STUDENTS. SO GETTING TO THE BOTTOM LINE OF YOUR QUESTION DOES THAT MAKE DOESN'T MIRROR VISION FULLY FUND THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE IT DOES. IT FULLY FUNDS WHAT THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES REQUESTED IN NOVEMBER WHICH WAS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. TO FULLY FROM THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE. WE'RE REALLY APPRECIATIVE OF THAT AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO END UP BEING A REAL GOOD CORN SEED SO TO SPEAK. IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO REACH OUR GOAL AT EIGHT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE OF HAVING ALL THOSE EQUITY GAPS NARROWED OR ELIMINATED. FULLY THAT'S WITH R. U. R. M. STUDENTS AS WELL AS WITH OUR PELL GRANT ELIGIBLE POPULATION STUDENTS. THANK YOU THAT'S REALLY- RESPONSIVE ANSWER IN A GOOD ANSWER AND- DOES THAT MEAN THAT IN A YEAR OR TWO. WE WILL ALL BE TALKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL VERSION OF THIS GOING FORWARD AFTER THE CURRENT TIME FRAME AND GOALS ARE COMPLETED. QUITE POSSIBLY- THIS PLACE KNOWN AS CALIFORNIA IS ALWAYS ON THE MARCH TO TRY TO DO BETTER SO WE MADE LAYER ON TOP OF THIS A NEW INITIATIVE COULD EXTEND IT IT JUST DEPENDS- WE HAVE A BRAND NEW CHANCELLOR AND HE HAS TO LAY OUT HIS HIS VISION FOR HIS ADMINISTRATION HOWEVER LONG THAT IS. RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN THE THICK OF THE GRAND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN HE'S FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE ONE THAT WE ARE PURSUING RIGHT NOW RIGHT AND THEN I HAVE ONE. LAST QUESTION. FOR YOU THE CSU SYSTEM. THE GOVERNOR- HIS PROPOSAL ABOUT. MAKING HUMBOLDT STATE TO BECOME A POLITICIAN I REPRESENTED CAL POLY MY MOTHER GRADUATED FROM THE OTHER CAL POLY AND YOU GUYS ALL TALKED ABOUT IT. BUT LET ME ASK THE QUESTION A DIFFERENT WAY IF. IT COMES HUMBLED STAGES. HAS ITS OWN NICHE NOW IS REALLY STRONG WHEN I WAS RESOURCES SECRETARY I THINK A MAJORITY OF THE CAL FIRE FORSTER SAID GRADUATED FROM HUMBOLDT STATE FORESTRY PROGRAM- WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE. THE COURT WHAT WOULD WE SEE. OUR OUR IF POSSIBLE STATE BECOMES A CAL POLY WHAT DO WE SEE. FROM THE OUTSIDE. AS A DIFFERENCE IN ITS MISSION OR OUTPUT HOW IT OPERATES WHAT IT MEANS IF POSSIBLE STATE BECOMES A COUPLE. WELL OBVIOUSLY SENATOR- WE'RE AT THE EARLY STAGES OF FIGURING THIS OUT AS MY COLLEAGUE MISS KING SAID FROM THE LA- THE CAMPUS IS DOING A SELF REFLECTION OR SELF STUDY. ON HOW FEASIBLE IT IS TO ADVANCE- COUPLE EIGHT W. I'M SORRY HUMBLE TO A POLYTECHNIC. I THINK YOU TOUCHED ON ONE OF THE MAIN- APPLIED SCIENCES PROGRAMS THAT I THINK WOULD BE STRENGTHENED. AT HUMBLE WHICH WOULD BE THE FORESTRY- SIDE OF THINGS YOU ALSO SEE AN INCREASE IN A NUMBER OF ENGINEERING PROGRAMS- GENERALLY ACROSS THE STATE THERE IS A COLOSSAL DEMAND FOR. ADDITIONAL ENGINEERING SPACE WE OFFER MORE OF THAT AT HUMBLE. THERE'S ALSO OTHER NICHE AREAS IN IN THAT AREA OF THE STATE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF OCEANOGRAPHY. AN AQUACULTURE THAT COULD BE EXPANDED THERE'S A LOT OF REALLY GOOD OPPORTUNITIES THERE- AND- I THINK I THINK I'LL STOP THERE I DON'T WANNA GET TOO FAR AHEAD OF IT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE CAMPUS IS REALLY DREADING THIS INTERNALLY IN TRYING TO WORK WITH OTHERS IN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO WORK THROUGH WHAT THE ACADEMIC PLAN WOULD BE- BUT BUT CLEARLY- AS THERE IS SO MUCH DEMAND AT OUR OTHER- A POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITIES- THERE IS ROOM. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE COULD BE A THIRD AND IT COULD BE- WELL SITUATED TO SERVE MORE CALIFORNIANS IN THAT WAY MON I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE- JUST NOTE ONE THING OUT OF THE RESPONSE WHICH IS IT'S BEING VETTED AND NETWORK. ASKING TO PROVE WHAT HASN'T TOTALLY BEEN VETTED IN WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL TOTALLY BE AND SO I THINK THAT'S JUST QUESTION WILL HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH AND NOT. IN THE BUDGET PROCESS AND IT GOES BACK TO CENTER GROVE CHUG CHUG BUGS QUESTION OF. OF HOW YOU VET HOW THINGS ACTUALLY TURNED OUT TO THE END AND HOW YOU MEASURE THEM AND SO. THIS IS A VERY MUCH A MOVING TARGET I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT IN THE COMING DAYS AND WEEKS. LET ME GO TO MY COLLEAGUES OR OTHER QUESTIONS. US SENATOR MAN AND THEN. START WITH. HERE WANTED TO FOLLOW UP- ON THE OF FOUR HUMBLED AND- I THINK IT SOUNDS LIKE A FINE PROPOSAL GIVEN THAT NEEDS FOR MORE POLYTECHNIC EDUCATION. BUT YOU KNOW I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IT FOR ALLOCATING FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR. CAPITAL NEEDS AND INFRASTRUCTURE. YET YOU KNOW THAT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A LOT OF MONEY ARE YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS AS AS I THINK THE CSU REPRESENTATIVE MR STORM DESCRIBED BY EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IS WHAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES IS WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO BASICALLY IT LOOKS LIKE GIVE THE WHOLE HOG KUMBLE. WHILE- YOU KNOW NOT. BITING EQUITABLE FUNDING TO THE OTHER CSU'S INCLUDING CSU FULLERTON WHICH IS IN MY NECK OF THE WOODS THAT. I KNOW HAS ENORMOUS INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. H. AS FAR AS NEW CAPITAL PROJECTS AS FAR AS JUST UPDATING SOME OF ITS- OUTDATED FACILITIES- YOU KNOW WHY HUMBLE AND- WHY NOT. DECIDE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE SHOULD BE INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING SHOULD BE SHARED MORE EQUITABLY. THANK YOU CENTERMAN FOR THE QUESTION I GENEROUSLY WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE FLORIDA THREE THREE MILLION OF ONE TIME TOWARD INFRASTRUCTURE IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSITION- TO ONBOARD THE INCREASED NUMBER OF STUDENTS IS. THAT WILL BE ENROLLED WHEN AND IT SEEMS YOU HUMBLE BECOMES A POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY AND AS- MY COLLEAGUE RAIN STORM AT SEA AS YOU MENTION- BECAUSE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DEMAND BY US STUDENTS TO ATTEND- COULD THE CURRENT- POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITIES AT CAL POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO AND HOPEFULLY COME OUT AND- THE MINISTRATION BELIEVES THAT. THE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS- TO UPGRADE ALL LABORATORIES AND THE APPLIED SCIENCES AS WELL AS- AS HOUSING IN PARTICULAR- ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE TRANSITION AND TO MEET DEMAND ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR PRIZE AND THAT INCREASED TO A ROMANCE AS WELL AS TO ALLEVIATE- THE LOCAL HOUSING MARKET I'M ASSOCIATED WITH THAT RISING STUDENTS- AND- AND THAT'S THE REASON FOR AT THIS SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT VERSUS YOU HUMBLE. SURE BUT I GUESS JUST A FOLLOW UP I MEAN T. S. U. FULLERTON. WHICH IS NOT MY DISTRICT PROTEST OUTSIDE- WE HAVE HOUSING FOR THERE IN FACT THERE STUDENTS ARE HOMELESS BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF. THEY'RE LIVING IN THEIR CARS. DO YOU HAVE AN URGENT NEED FOR LABORATORY SPACE THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH. SO ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEMS YOU MENTIONED WITH HUMBLE CERTAINLY EXISTS FOR OTHER CSU'S. SO AGAIN MY QUESTION IS WHY PRIORITISE ONE CAMPUS AT THE EXPENSE OF ALL THE OTHERS. MEDICATIONS THAT DANCER QUESTION ANSWER I HAD TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR ANSWER THAT QUESTION. AS THIS YOU HUMBLE M. IS AT A PARTY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE IT THEY WERE. RECOGNIZED THAT- HUMBLE AND IS AND IS IT PRIME- AMBLE POSITION TO HELP WITH THEIR WORKFORCE MAN'S PARTICULARLY AND STAB. AND ECAUSE OF THAT NEED A NEED- AND THE OVERALL WORK FORCE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- THAT'S THE REASON WHY FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE. IN MS LOUIS. YOUR COLLEAGUE HAS A RAISED HAND DID SHE MAY BE TRYING TO RESCUE YOU RIGHT NOW SO WHAT. I'LL RECOGNIZE PRETTY ON APPROACH. I THINK YOU MIGHT CHAIR I YES FOR IS THAT. A THE RIGHT SHOT AND I ECHO HER COMMON AS WELL. THE ONLY THING THAT I WOULD ADD IS THAT WE DO ALSO HAVE DIFFERENT MEANINGS PATHFINDING PROPOSED. IN THE BUDGET WE HAD A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION FROM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- THAT IS STILL A PART OF THE PROPOSAL AND TO DATE. THERE'S ALSO AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR DIFFERENT MEAT AND SO WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT NEED AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM FOR DIFFERENT MAINTENANCE MARK BROADLY- WE SEE THE FORMAT AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID WE SEE THE FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE MILLION. SPECIFIC TO WHAT THEY NEED FOR TRANSITIONING- CS YOU HUMBLED INTO A COLLEGE TECHNICS- SO BACK IN NICE AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT NEEDS THE REST OF THAT THAT SEGMENT- DESK PROPOSAL IS SYMPATHETIC TO THE TRANSITION ITSELF I GUESS I JUST FOLLOW UP AND NOTE THAT. YOU KNOW YEAH AMONG THE THINGS BEING FUNDED BY FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS OUR STUDENT HOUSING WHICH IS TRADITIONALLY SELF SUPPORTED- AND OTHER USES THAT. YOU KNOW SEEM LIKE YOU'RE GIVING THEM THE GOLD PLATED TREATMENT AND- I'LL JUST NOTE THAT THERE'S THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS BUDGET. FOR THE ENTIRE CSU SYSTEM AND YOU'RE PROPOSING TO DEDICATE FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE AGAIN INCLUDING PROGRAMS. THEY'RE NOT TRADITIONALLY SUPPORTED BY THE STATE- TO THE HUMBLE TRANSITION- IN I WOULD SAY I WISH I HAD SOME PROBLEMS WITH THAT NIGHT I'D LOVE TO HEAR FROM MR STORM IT'S. YES YOU WANT ON HIS OVERALL PERSPECTIVE. NOT QUITE ON THE SPONSOR- I WAS JUST A PLAYING A LITTLE BIT OF DIGITAL CHALLENGING HERE TRYING TO FIND MY A NEW BUTTON AND- ANYWAY REAL QUICKLY- YES CHALLENGE SENATOR OF COURSE WE HAVE FOUR BUT AS AS MY COLLEAGUE MS KING FROM THE LA- SAID WE HAVE FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE- AND THERE'S A LOT OF NEED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM AND- ON THE ONE HAND- OBVIOUSLY I AGREE WITH YOU IN A IN A LOT OF WAYS YOU KNOW MORE. MORE FUNDING PER OUR REQUEST THAT YOU'VE HEARD US CALLOUSLY SUGGESTED WE NEED TO INCREASE HARD FOR MAINTENANCE BUT THE OTHER ON THE OTHER HAND TO THERE'S THIS THIS OPPORTUNITY HERE WITH AS MUCH FUNDING AS THE STATE HAS TO DO REAL VISIONARY CHANGER FOR HUMBOLDT STATE SO OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO DO IT ALL AND- WE MAYBE THERE'S A WAY THAT YOU ALL CAN FIGURE THAT OUT IN YOUR BUDGET AND MAKE THAT ALL WORK. BUT THAT THOSE ARE THOSE ARE BOTH- IT BUT BOTH SIGNIFICANT NEEDS I THINK- HUMBLED STATE FOR AS MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW- HAS HAD ITS CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF KEEPING ENROLLMENT AT CURRENT LEVELS% AND THE CURRENT OFFERINGS IS ABLE TO HOLD AND I THINK THIS- HUMBOLDT STATE UNIVERSITY AS A POLYTECHNIC MAY BE. A SIGNIFICANT GAME CHANGER FOR KEEPING THAT- SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT UP IN THE NORTH. COAST THERE- VIABLE GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU. A CENTER OF TROUBLE DID YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY I HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION BEFORE WE MOVE ON BECAUSE IT OCCURRED TO ME.

OF THE STATE CONTRIBUTION TO MATCH THE DISASTER FUNDS FOR THE REBUILDING AND ISSUES AND BIG BASIN PARK BUT I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING HERE. FOR CAL POLY SWANTON AND I KNOW THAT- THAT I HAVE I WAS THERE BEFORE THE FIRE AND I WAS THERE AFTER THE FIRE AND WAS UNRECOGNIZABLE MY COULDN'T EVEN SEE WHERE. THE SMALL GAUGE RAILWAY AND SOME OF THE OTHER CAL POLY BUILDINGS HAD BEEN THE ONLY CAL POLY BUILDING THAT SURVIVED WAS ONE THAT WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIELD THAT SOMEHOW THE FIRE WENT BY.

SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES- WITHOUT THANK YOU AND IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY. I BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE MY COLLEGE OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. WERE GOING TO GO ON TO THE LA O'S OFFICE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING AUSTIN HAUSEN WITH THE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AS YOU JUST HEARD THERE'S A LOT HAPPENING WITH THAT COMMITTEE COLLEGE BUDGET YOU HAVE TO BE REVISION. WE SEE- SOME SOME REAL POSITIVES HERE- SPECIALLY ON THE TWO BIGGEST- SPENDING PROPOSALS IN ONE TIME MONEY- THAT'S MONEY FOR DEFERRALS AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WE THINK IT'S VERY POSITIVE. TO SEE THE MAY REVISE PROPOSED RETIRE ALL THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DEFERRALS IN THE BUDGET YEAR WE TALKED ABOUT THAT THIS COMMITTEE- BACK IN FEBRUARY WE RECOMMEND LEGISLATURE APPROVES THAT. OUR MESSAGE ON FUNDING TO ADDRESS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS VERY SIMILAR TO THE MESSAGE YOU JUST HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUES ON THE UNIVERSITY'S BUDGETS. WE THINK IT HAS MERIT AND WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE TREAT THEM A REVISED PROPOSAL PROPOSED FUNDING LEVEL AS A MINIMUM. GIVEN THE SIZE OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG WHICH IS OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS. THE LEGISLATURE COULD FREE UP FUNDS TO ADDRESS EVEN MORE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FOR ADDRESS OTHER COST PRESSURES WHICH MANY COLLEGES ARE FACING SUCH AS PENSIONS. BY REJECTING THOSE BUDGET PROPOSALS THAT THE LEGISLATURE. DEEMS UNJUSTIFIED OR OTHERWISE LOWER PRIORITY FOR EXAMPLE THE MAY REVISE PROPOSES FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS YOU JUST HEARD FROM CODED RESPONSE BLOCK GRANT BASED ON DISCUSSIONS WE'VE HAD WITH A NUMBER OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. FEDERALLY FUNDS ARE SUFFICIENT TO COVER THOSE COSTS SUCH AS COSTS TO A TRANSITION TO RE. RE OPENED CAMPUSES IN THE FALL. IN TERMS OF ONGOING SPENDING THE LARGEST PROPOSAL COVERS A 4% COST OF LIVING INCREASE FOR APPORTIONMENT. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THAT WILL HELP THE COLLEGES ADDRESS RISING SALARY BENEFIT NO OTHER COST PRESSURES. THE VICE PROPOSES A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT AND OR OTHER TYPE OF BASE AUGMENTATION TO SOME CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS OF THE PERCENT VARIES FROM ONE POINT GIMME A CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS. WOULD NOT RECEIVE ANY TYPE OF BASE AUGMENTATION EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE A NUMBER OF STUDENT SUPPORT PROGRAMS A STAFF YOU'LL PERSONNEL- DO YOU HAVE SALARY BENEFIT COST PRESSURES. SO THE LEGISLATURE REALLY HAS AN OPPORTUNITY HERE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO GIVE A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT TO THE SAME SET OF CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS AS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR GIVE A HIGHER. AMOUNT TO THOSE FORTUNATE TO FIND A LARGER SET OF CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS AND AS WE HAVE THE ONE TIME FUNDS LEGISLATURE COULD FREE P FUNDS- FROM MONEY THAT THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING AN ONGOING EXPENSES IDENTIFIED THOSE ONGOING PROPOSALS THAT ARE UNJUSTIFIED OR ARE LOWER PRIORITIES LEGISLATURE. AND PERHAPS USE THAT MONEY REDIRECTED TO FUND HIGHER COST OF LIVING- HIGHER COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR TWO CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS SO THERE'S MANY OPPORTUNITIES HERE FOR LEGISLATURE TO START ITS OWN PRIORITIES HERE. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO IN THE COMING WEEKS A WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE STAFF TO. COME TO A PACKAGE THAT'S REALLY REFLECTIVE OF THE LEGISLATURE AND WHAT IT VALUES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THEN WE'LL. MOVE ON TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CENTER LARRY MEMBERS THE SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION MY NAME IS LIZ AND- AT I AM THE VICE CHANCELLOR COLLEGE FINANCING FACILITIES PLANNING AT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ADDRESSING A HARDSHIP FOR COMPLETE COLLEGE STUDENTS FACE DUE TO THE PANDEMIC HAS REQUIRED TREMENDOUS EFFORT BY STUDENTS FACULTY STAFF AND ADMINISTRATORS IN THE OVERALL SYSTEM TO RESPOND SWIFTLY AND URGENTLY. PUTTING STUDENTS FIRST CONTINUES TO BE THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND ALL ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE CALGARY COLLEGES. CHRISTY TREATS DID HE TAKE IT INVESTMENTS PAVE THE ROAD FORT TO RECOVERY. WE COLLEGES AND STUDENTS HAVE SUFFERED THE MOST DURING THE ACADEMIC AND INTACT THIS IS WHY I FIRST WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE. FOR THEIR APPROVAL OF THE IMMEDIATE ACTION PACKAGE. THOSE INVESTMENTS FOCUSED ON EMERGENCY AID AND STUDENT ENGAGEMENT AT EIGHT IN THE FIRST STEPS TO RECOVERY. WE THINK THAT WE THINK THE GOVERNOR AND HIS ADMINISTRATION FOR A MAIN REVISED PROPOSAL THAT PLAYS A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR RE EMERGING FROM THE PANDEMIC. EQUITABLY AND RESILIENT LEE AND FOR SEEING OUR SYSTEM AS A AS A KEY STRATEGY IN THAT PLAN. INVESTMENTS PRESENTED IN THE MAY REVISION GENERALLY FALL INTO SIX CATEGORIES RESTORING INSTITUTIONAL RESOURCES. I WAS GONNA MAKE RECOVERY DIVERSITY EQUITYAND INCLUSION AFFORDABILITY AND BASIC NEEDS WORK FORCE AND PATHWAYS. I'LL COVER SOME POINTS AROUND EACH OF THESE INVESTMENTS- GROUND ON RESTORING INSTITUTIONAL RESOURCES COST PRESSURES FOR COLLEGES CONTINUE TO GROW AND- MAKING THE INVESTMENT IN ONGOING FUNDS CRITICAL WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE GOVERNOR FOR PURSUING- AND PROPOSING THE FULL PAY DOWN OF THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION THE DEFERRALS CHAR COLLEGES. CAME DOWN THE STEPS TO COLLEGES IT'S A KEY STAT AND PUTTING THE HARDSHIPS OF THE PANDEMIC BEHIND US. WE ALSO THANK THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE FOR HEARING OUR CONCERNS AROUND THE LACK OF CLARITY IN THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT TO CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND STRONGLY SUPPORT THE PROPOSED COMPOUNDED COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT OF FOUR POINT 005% FURTHER WE SUPPORT OUR EFFORTS TO ENSURE HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE ACTIONABLE PLANS AND STRATEGIES TO COPE LOWS LINGERING AND STUBBORN EDUCATION OUR EQUITY GAPS. HELLO HOWEVER WE DO CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS AROUND A PROPOSAL TO REQUIRE DISTRICTS TO MAINTAIN ONLINE COURSES ONLINE AND AT LEAST 10% HIGHER THAN THEY WERE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN. THOUGH WE DO NOT HAVE CONCERNS WITH OLINE COURSES AND BELIEVE THEY PROVIDE MUCH FLEXIBILITY TO POST TRADITIONAL LEARNERS THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE- TO SUPPORT THE HARD AND FAST RULE OF 10% AROUND POST ENDEMIC RECOVERY OF THE PANDEMIC CONTINUES IN OUR DISTRICTS REQUIRE ON GOING RESEARCH SINCE AS THEY PREPARE FOR INCREASED COSTS. AND RECURRING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH SAFE CAMPUS REOPENING- AS A RESULT WE STRONGLY SUPPORT EFFORTS TO RE ENGAGE AND HELP OUR STUDENTS RETURN TO OUR CAMPUSES THESE DISRUPTIONS HAVE LEFT LINGERING SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES. THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES OF COLOR AND CONTINUE TO THREATEN A LONG ELUSIVE EQUITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION AS EVIDENCED BY OUR ENROLLMENT DECLINES SO AGAIN WE SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL. AROUND DIFFERENT MAINTENANCE COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE A DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG OF OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S THE SHARED BY- MY ALLEY- COLLEAGUE. SO WE ALSO- WILL TURN TO DIFFERENT MAINTENANCE TO HELP OUR RE OPENING OF CAMPUSES FOR INSPIRATION INSTRUCTION WITH KEEPING SAFETY AT THE FOREFRONT SO WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE INVESTMENT OF THREE ON THREE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN MILLION ONE TIME AND PROP NINETY EIGHT. AND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FROM THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN THIS ISN'T A STEP IN HELPING US ACHIEVE. A SAFE FREE OPENING ADDRESSING OUR BACKLOG. AND ENSURING THAT WE PROVIDE SAFETY TO OUR STUDENTS FACULTY AND STAFF. AROUND EVERY SEE EQUITY AND INCLUSION INVESTMENTS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES- AND PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE OUR IMPORTANT WORK TO DISMANTLE STRUCTURES AND PRACTICES THAT PERPETUATE SYSTEMIC RACISM. WE SUPPORT THE FOLLOWING INVESTMENTS IN LINE WITH THE CHALCEDONY COLLEGES VISION FOR SUCCESS TO CLOSE EQUITY GAPS THESE INCLUDE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY INVESTMENT OF TWENTY MILLION. TO HELP IMPLEMENT BEST PRACTICES TODAY VERSUS FIRE FACULTY AND STAFF. AND TO RETURN SO THAT THEY MAY REFLECT THE RICH DIVERSITY OF OUR STUDENTS. SEE SEE SEE REGISTRY MODERNIZATION OR WHAT THE PROPOSED ONE MILLION INVESTMENT FOR SECURITY UPGRADES AND MODERNIZATION OF pDISTRICT REGISTRY TO HELP. TALENTED INDIVIDUALS FIND JOBS AND OPPORTUNITIES AND ARE GREAT SYSTEM. AND A BASED ON MEDITATION OF TWENTY THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION FOR OUR STUDENT EQUITY AND ACHIEVEMENT PROGRAM. THIS IS A CRITICAL EQUITY PROGRAM THAT IS. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR CAMPUSES. AROUND ONE FORCE- WE AS A SYSTEM ARE THE PLACE THAT CALIFORNIANS TURN TO DEFINE WORKFORCE OPPORTUNITIES I AND IF YOU FIND A LIVABLE. WAGES AS A RESULT OF THEIR EDUCATION THE PROPOSAL HAS VARIOUS WORKFORCE INVESTMENT WILL TALK ABOUT A FEW OF THEM. HI ROAD TRAINING PARTNERSHIP SAID REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS THIS IS AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT WE COLLABORATE WITH CROSS AGENCIES. LIKE THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARDS TWENTY MILLION INVESTMENT WILL HELP CALIFORNIANS CAME BACK TO WORK. STRONG WORK FORCE HAS BEEN OUR LONG STANDING COLLEGE AND COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY OUR WORKFORCE IS STRONGLY SUPPORT THE BASE INCREASE OF 5% GROUNDWORK BASED LEARNING WE'RE GLAD TO SEE THE INCLUSION OF AN ADDITIONAL TEN MILLION FOR THIS STRATEGY SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON EMERGING. CLOUD COMPUTING AND ZERO EMISSION- AND I SUPPLY CHAIN FEELS. AND THEN AROUND AFFORDABILITY OUT FOR MANY OF OUR STUDENTS FINANCES HOW ARE THE MAIN BARRIER TO ACHIEVING EDUCATIONAL GOALS FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE PREPARING THESE CONNECTED TO EDUCATION- DURING THE ACADEMIC AND THIS HAS BEEN A HUGE CHALLENGE SO WE'RE GLAD TO SEE VARIOUS INVESTMENTS IN ZERO TEXTBOOK COST YOU GREASE INCLUDING. HUNDRED FIFTEEN MILLION ONE TIME WE BELIEVE ZERO TEXTBOOK COST AND LOW COST PATHWAY TO SAVE STUDENTS AN AVERAGE OF SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PRIOR MODEST INVESTMENTS IN ZERO TEXTBOOK COST YOU CREATE AND SAVE ESTIMATED FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR STUDENTS TRANSITIONING FROM OUR DEPENDENCY ON EXPORTS TO MORE INNOVATIVE MODELS SUCH AS OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES. CAN SUPPORT THE AFFORDABILITY AGENDA IN THIS BUDGET AND ACROSS OUR SYSTEM. BROWN BASE NEEDS AND FEBRUARY. I HATE TO INTERRUPT THE COULD YOU BEGIN TO WRAP UP BECAUSE WE'RE- REALLY WAY BEHIND HERE. AND I KNOW EVERY ONE OF THESE ISSUES IS IMPORTANT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YES AND THE ONLY THING- ADARAND BASIC NEEDS THAT WE HOPE THAT- THE LEGISLATURE WILL CONSIDER A COMPREHENSIVE CONCEPT THAT LOOKS AT LOOKING AT MORE OFFERING THESE SUPPORTS MORE HOLISTICALLY TOURISTS STUDENTS BY ENSURING THAT WE PROVIDE BASIC NEEDS OF FOOD SUPPORTS AND FINANCIAL AID. A COMPREHENSIVE MODEL AND THEN WE SUPPORT THE VARIOUS- PATHWAY INVESTMENTS IN THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDING GUIDED PATHWAYS TECHNOLOGY IN COURSE NUMBERING LASTING ALL ADDRESS THAT IS YOU KNOW THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE HAS A STACK OF ONLY A HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX. INDIVIDUALS TO SUPPORT TWO POINT ONE MILLION SYSTEM SEVENTY THREE DISTRICTS AND A HUNDRED SIXTEEN COLLEGES SO WE URGE THE CONSIDERATION OF GREATER CAPACITIES TO SUPPORT THESE NEW AND EXPANDED INITIATIVES THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR- COMMENTS. LET ME GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FIRST THERE'S JUST BEEN SOME CONFUSION OVER JUST TERMINOLOGY COULD YOU EXPLAIN. WHAT A FOUR POINT 5% INCREASE COMPOUNDED MEANS BY THAT IS IT JUST A FOUR POINT. 5% INCREASE. SURE DAN HAD OUR AND OUR ARGUMENT MY BEST- SO I THINK SPECIFICALLY THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT THAT HAS TRADITIONALLY PROVIDED AND- STATUTE IS THE IMPLICIT PRICE DEFLATOR AND SO THE COUPLE- BASED ON THAT CALCULATION FOR THE BUDGET YEAR WAS ONE POINT 7% AT THE MARAVICH AND- HOWEVER WE REALIZE THAT A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT WAS NOT PROVIDED TO THE- APPORTIONMENT FUNDING IN THE CURRENT YEAR. SO WE ALSO WANTED TO REFLECT THAT FINDING OUT THAT THERE IS A VEIL ON GOING FUNDING PROVIDED IN THE BUDGET SO IN IN ATHENS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WILL BE RECEIVING A FOUR POINT 005% COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS FOR THEIR PORTION THAT'S MOVING FORWARD- HOWEVER WE WANTED TO SYMBOLICALLY NOTE THAT- DIMINISHES AS OPPOSED TO IS TO PROVIDE FUNDING. FOR THAT- PORK ON COLOR IN THE CURRENT YEAR. OKAY IT'S JUST THAT THERE'S STILL SOME CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS AND SOME PEOPLE THINK IT MEANS MORE AND SOMETHING PEOPLE THINK IT MEANS LESS AND SO ON THERE. YES IF YOU'D LIKE I CAN. GO FOR TRANSIT SO I THINK ALL IT MEANS IS IN THE CURRENT THE CURRENT YEAR COLLEGES SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN I THINK IT WAS AROUND A TWO POINT DIDN'T GET THAT BECAUSE OF THE TIME WHEN THE BUDGET WAS ENACTED A YEAR AGO- THERE WAS A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT THE BUDGET SITUATION. SO FOR THE BUDGET YEAR THE GUNNERS RISING ONE POINT 7% SO I THINK. THE IDEA OF A COMPOUNDED COSTLY JUST IS JUST. FIRST THE COLLEGES GET A TWO POINT THREE PERCENT. INCREASE SO THEY GOT THAT INCREASE IN ON DEMAND THEY GET A ONE POINT 7% ON TOP OF THAT SO WHEN YOU ADD THAT UP IT'S NOT JUST A 4% INCREASE OR IT'S ABOUT IT'S A FOUR POINT 005% BECAUSE IT'S THE- BUDGET YEAR. COST OF LIVING IS ON TOP OF THE- THE MONEY THEY GET FROM A CALL UP FROM THE CURRENT YEAR. THE MAKE UP CALL LIFE YOU. AND LET ME TRY TO DIFFERENT WAY. THAT THAT'S HELPFUL. THAT'S DEFINITELY TRUE- IF. WE WERE PRE PLANNED- MAC. TO NILES WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO. IN IN FUNDING THERE WAS A CUT OF A CERTAIN AMOUNT AND THEN IT CAME BACK TWO OR THREE TIMES- I BELIEVE THAT THERE'S AN INCREASE OVER THE PRE PLANNED- MAKE FUNDING WHAT'S THE NATURE OF THAT INCREASE. SO LEADING- SORT OF TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS- FLAT THERE WAS NO SPECIFIC CUTS TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BUDGET THERE WAS A- POST. PRODUCTION AND- WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED WAS THAT SHOULD BE AN APARTMENT FOR ALL. SO FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE A PORTION THERE WILL BE. A COMPARATIVE PREPAID DEBIT CALLS. IT A FOUR POINT 005% INCREASE OVER THE PREPAID DEBIT BUBBLES. PERFECT THAT'S WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT. AND THEN LET ME ASK- ONCE AGAIN FINANCE. WHILE WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE INCREASE- IN THE COLA. THERE'S CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS THAT. HELP SUPPORT STUDENTS MASSA POINT TO A PART TIME FACULTY OFFICE HOURS. NONE OF THOSE RECEIVED A COLA. R. R. CAN YOU SAY. WHY THEY DIDN'T RECEIVE A CALL. SURE WHILE THE ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZED THAT THESE CHEMICALS TO PROVIDE IMPORTANT PROGRAMS AND SERVICES TO STUDENTS- DOCTOR LIVING ADJUSTMENTS WERE PROVIDED TO THE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE TYPICALLY RECEIVED A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. AND BUDGET HISTORICALLY SO WE SIMPLY CONTINUE THAT PRACTICE OF PROVIDING COUNSELING ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE TRADITIONALLY RECYCLE. AT LEAST THAT'S THE CONSISTENT WITH THE ANSWER THAT I GOT IN FEBRUARY. EXCEPT I DIDN'T LIKE IT THAT. AND IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY DIDN'T MAKE THE CUT IN THE PAST THERE CONTINUED TO BE PENALIZED BECAUSE THEY GIVE GOOD SERVICES AND VALUABLE SERVICES SO I HOPE THAT. THAT WE CAN LOOK AT COST OF LIVING INCREASES FOR EVERYONE AND NOT JUST BECAUSE THERE WEREWINNERS AND LOSERS HISTORICALLY THE LOSERS. ARE CONTINUE THE NAME OF LASTLY- THE COMMON COURSE NUMBER RING IT WAS MENTIONED IN PASSING IN. WHAT'S THE VALUE WHAT WHAT WHAT'S THE GAIN IN SPENDING THIS AS OPPOSED TO SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE AREA. IN THE SYSTEM. AND I GUESS I SHOULD START WITH A FINANCING. SURE SO I CAN CLOSE BY THAT CURRENTLY THERE ARE DISPARATE NUMBERING SYSTEMS ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN SOME WORK IN THE TERRIERS ARE JUST REMEMBERING SYSTEMS FOR COURSES ACROSS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. SO BY CREATING A COMMON COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM WE CANNOT ON THE- MAKE IT EASIER FOR STUDENTS TO MAP OUT THEIR THEIR PATHWAY AND FIGURE OUT WHAT SORT OF COURSES THEY NEED BUT ALSO IF THEY TRANSFER TO A DIFFERENT COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR EVEN TO AC IF YOU CAN HELP CLARIFY THE PROCESS FOR THOSE STUDENTS AND- MAKE IT A MUCH MORE SIMPLE PROCESS PER PER STUDENT DATA GETTING THREE. BETWEEN A COLLEGE SYSTEM MUCH I THINK ALIGNS WITH THE PATHWAYS AND A LOT OF WORK BEING DONE TO THE VISION FOR SUCCESS SO WE DID IT IN ONE NOW THE OVERALL EVERY COMMUNITY COLLEGE AS AN ARTICULATION STUDY WHICH IS BASICALLY HOW IT'S COURSES CONNECT IN TRANSFER ABILITY IS SIX EXPECTED IF YOU DID COMMON COURSE NUMBER ON. THAT IT TAKES AWAY A BUNCH OF THE NEED TO DO. A LOT OF BRICK ARTICULATION STUDIES. AND MAY. THIS MAYBE ALL. A DAN AND GO IT WAS A ON THIS ONE. FESTA HAPPY TO ADD ON THIS- CORE COMMON COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM WOULD ALLOW STUDENTS AND- ANY INSTITUTION WHERE STUDENTS TAKES THAT COURSE ON TO KNOW WHAT. WHAT THEY'VE LEARNED WITHIN THAT COURSE AND SO A PHYSICS CLASS IN ONE DISTRICT IS- WITH THE SAME NUMBER THAT CAN BE EXPECTED TO HAVE THE SAME LEARNING OUTCOMES AS A PHYSICS CLASS IN ANOTHER. AT ANOTHER DISTRICT THAT'S THE BENEFIT IT ALSO EASES CONFUSION FROM A STUDENT- ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES ME SCENE AND SOME OF OUR COMPLETION EFFORTS IS THAT STUDENTS HAVE. AN AVERAGE OF NINETY UNITS TO COMPLETE AN ASSOCIATE'S DEGREE WHICH SHOULD REQUIRE SIXTY UNITS OFTEN THIS IS BECAUSE THEY TAKE CLASSES THAT WERE REDUNDANT OR THEY ULTIMATELY DID. SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT COURSE RING NUMBER RANG WITH ELIMINATE PEOPLE TAKING RETURNED CLASSES IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. THAT'S ONE OF THE BENEFITS YES. HELLO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION SO ON THAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWER OTHER SENATORS ANY QUESTIONS. US SENATOR MAN. I JUST HAD A COMMENT I WANTED TO- ECHOED THE COMMENTS OF THE CCC REPRESENTATIVE ABOUT THE ONLINE LEARNING REQUIREMENT- PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC HI I DON'T PRETEND TO BE FULLY STEEPED IN D. PEDAGOGICAL RESEARCH OUT THERE BUT- I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THE CONSENSUS IS THAT THERE ARE DRASTIC DIFFERENCES IN THE QUALITY AND OUTCOMES BETWEEN IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. AND ONLINE LEARNING AND WE'VE JUST GONE THROUGH A YEAR AND A HALF LONG ALMOST YEAR AND A HALF LONG EXPERIMENT WITH A LOT OF DATA POINTS- AND I AND I THINK AT THIS POINT IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE RAFTS TO BE REQUIRING A 10% INCREASE IN ONLINE LEARNING. WHEN IT THE DATA SUGGESTS THAT THAT'S UNFAIR AND WE'RE ABOUT TO GET A LOT MORE DATA ANALYZED TO THAT EFFECT SO I WOULD SUGGEST THERE MIGHT BE A BETTER POLICY PATHWAY TO CONSIDER HOLDING OFF ON THAT RATHER THAN CREATING A WHAT IS BEEN DESCRIBED AS AN ARBITRARY PERCENTAGE NUMBER THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE A VERY STRONG POLICY BASIS BUT- THAT'S JUST MY TWO CENTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MAN SINGH NO OTHER QUESTIONS- LET ME MAKE SORT OF A CLOSING COMMENT BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN THERE'S A LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY IN THIS BUDGET TO THAT OUR TIME DID NOT ALLOW US TO FULLY EXPLORE TODAY- BECAUSE I THINK. APPRECIATED THE EXPLANATION ABOUT THE- THE COLON YOUR HERE. PURCHASE THE FACT THAT THE DEFERRALS ARE PAID OFF HERE BUT FOR SOME REASON THEY'RE NOT PAID OFF IN K. THROUGH TWELVE- AND THE THERE ARE SOME ONGOING ISSUES WANT TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT TO CALL US FOR CERTAIN PROGRAMS. AND I THINK EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT BEING ADDRESSED IN THIS BUDGET IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY FROM A COUPLE OF ISSUES THAT WE WANT TO. AN ON GOING BASIS AND MAYBE NEXT YEAR LOOK AT WHICH IS. THE HISTORIC- ATTEMPT OVER THIRTY YEARS TO CHANGE THE FULL TIME PART TIME PERCENTAGE. AND ALSO THE FORMULA WE ARE NOT ADDRESSING THE FORMULA WE HAVE A TWO YEAR. HOLD HARMLESS STILL IN PLACE BECAUSE THERE'S A NUMBER OF DISTRICTS GO OVER FINANCIAL CLIFF IN TWO YEARS IF WE DON'T REVISE THAT. IT WAS MY HOPE THAT THAT WE LOOK AT THAT IN A MORE PERMANENT FIX. I KNOW THERE'S A CONTRACT WITH A CONSULTING FIRM TO LOOK AT THE OVERALL FORMULA RATHER THAN JOSH. I'D TRIED TO FIX IT FOR THE WINDSORS AND HOLD HARMLESS AN ON GOING BASIS SO MAYBE. THAT CONSULTING WORK WILL HELP US GOING INTO NEXT YEAR BUT THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT JUST ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED WE JUST CAN'T KEEP KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD AND WHILE WE'RE KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD BECAUSE IT WAS PRE DECIDED FOR TWO MORE YEARS. TO DO THE HOLD HARMLESS- I THINK THAT NEXT YEAR WE HAVE TO FUNDAMENTALLY ADDRESS THAT ISSUE AND BY CALLING IT OUT NOW NOBODY WILL BE SURPRISED OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS AND WE TALK ABOUT IT IN. AND TRY TO GET THERE. BUT WITH THAT. ARE WOMEN JUST THANK EVERYBODY- FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE AND WE HAVE LOTS OF CONVERSATIONS IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS WILL MOVE TO ISSUE FIVE WHICH IS MY REVISION. ALSO FOR THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION WE HAVE GABRIELA CHAVEZ FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LISA KING FROM THE LA O'S OFFICE CENTRIC BREMNER FROM THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION AND I KNOW THERE ARE OTHERS AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS SO LET'S GO IN THAT ORDER. AND WELCOME THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE REPRESENTATIVE. MORNING CHAIR LAYER AND MEMBERS THAT WERE LIKE CHILD WAS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. BYE THIS MONEY WILL BE BRIEF AND FOCUS MOSTLY ON THE MAY REVISION PROPOSALS- THE MAY REVISION PROVIDES ONE BILLION ONE TIME FEDERAL AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT FINES TO SUPPORT WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN DISPLACED AS A RESULT OF THE COPA NINETY PANDEMIC. THE PROPOSAL WILL ALLOW THE RICE'S STUDENT A COMMISSION CEASE ACT TO PROVIDE GRANTS TO DISPLACE WORKERS TO THE UC. AND AS EXTENSION CENTERS UC CSU AND CCC CAMPUSES. GRANTS WILL RANGE FROM ONE THOUSAND TO TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND COULD BE USED TO COVER COSTS A PAST SECONDARY PROGRAMS HIGH QUALITY TRAINING PROGRAMS OR TO START A BUSINESS. HE SAID WILL DETERMINE THE GRANT AMOUNT. MUST PRIORITIZE THE NEEDIEST ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS AND MUST PROVIDE AT LEAST HALF OF THAT FUNDING TO PROVIDE GRANTS TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CARING FOR A DEPENDENT CHILD. HI AT THE CHRISTIAN INSTITUTIONS ARE ENCOURAGED TO MATCH GRANTS USE OTHER INSTITUTIONS SIG AGE SHOULD BE USED TO SELL SUPPLEMENT AND NOT TO SUPPLANT OTHER SOURCES OF EIGHT. THE MAY REVISION ALSO PROVIDES AN INCREASE OF FOUR HUNDRED MILLION GENERAL FIND ONE TIME FOR A TOTAL OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM. THERE IS ALSO A TRAILER BILL ASSOCIATED WITH THIS AUGMENTATION- WHICH EFFECTIVELY OUT THE RICE'S INTERNS WHO PARTICIPATE AND TEACHING CREDENTIAL PROGRAMS TO BENEFIT FROM THE PROGRAM. THE TRAILER BILL ALSO AMENDS THE DEFINITION OF A HIGH NEED FAIL TO INCLUDE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION THERE ARE SEVERAL CASELOAD I JUST MEANT TO DIFFERENT CULTURAL PROGRAMS AND THE MAY REVISION ALSO UPDATES BECAUSE FOR THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS. BASED ON THE LATEST AVAILABLE INFORMATION FROM THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION AND I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE A SPECIFIC DETAILS DOWN QUESTIONS ON THESE UPDATED COSTS. OR IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ON THE OTHER- THE REVISION PROPOSALS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS WILL MOVE TO THE LA O'S OFFICE. INTERESTED TIME ALTHOUGH THAT'S JUST ON THE LARGEST PROPOSAL. THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION. WHICH IS THAT ON STATE EDUCATION ENTREPRENEURSHIP TRAINING GRANTS PROGRAM THAT THE ONE BILLION DEBT. IT'S JUST. CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL FIRST IT ISN'T WELL CONNECTED WITH THE STATE'S BROADER WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM INCLUDING PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED BY LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARDS IN SOCIAL SERVICES AGENCIES. FOR CONTENT MANAGER ASKED MANY OF THE BARRIERS TO RETRAINING THAT DISPLACED WORKERS FACE SUCH AS NOT KNOWING WHAT SHOPS RETRAINED FOR HOW TO ACCESS THAT TRAINING ACCESS. SUPPORT SERVICES SUCH AS CHILDCARE. PROGRAMS QUITE DIFFERENT NATURE FROM OTHER FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION MINISTRIES SUCH AS THE COMPOUND PROGRAM WHICH CAME UP EARLIER AND SHE'S HEARING. I BRING THIS UP BECAUSE WE THINK THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT EFFORT SECOND RESOURCES IN TIME. FOR THE COMMISSION TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTING THIS NEWLY PROPOSED PROGRAM. IT WOULD INVOLVE NOT JUST DISTRIBUTING GRANTS TO COLLEGE STUDENTS IS CHRISTIAN CONNIE DOES BUT ALSO DISTRIBUTING GRANTS TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. ENSURING THAT THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS HAVE APPLIED FOR BUSINESS LICENSES AND- BUILD A BUSINESS PLAN. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HAVING THAT A PROGRAM THAT WOULD TAKE SIGNIFICANT TIME RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT PARTICULARLY BECAUSE IT'S INTENDED TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES IT IS TIME SENSITIVE IN NATURE. JAYNE KAMIN SO GIVEN THESE CONSIDERATIONS BEING RECOMMENDED ACTING THIS COASTAL. THE COMMITTEE WILL BE TRYING TO CALL THE STATE TO TRANSFER FULL TOMORROW SO I ATE WELL AND COMING TOGETHER AT THIS TIME BUT I AM HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS ON ANY OTHER ITEMS DESTINY CHRISTIAN BUDGET AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VEY MUCH AND I WILL MOVE TO THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION. GOOD MORNING CHAIR LAYERED AND SENATORS I'M J. BREMNER HERE ON BEHALF OF THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN TODAY. MR NATE COMMISSION IS GRATEFUL TO SEE THE PROPOSED GOLDEN STATE EDUCATION ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND TRAINING GRANT PROGRAM INCLUDED IN THE MAY REVISION WHICH WOULD HELP US BETTER SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS AS THEY SEEK EDUCATIONAL AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES. OR START THEIR OWN BUSINESS ENTERPRISE. CONFIDENT THAT WITH THE APPROPRIATE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDING AND STAFFING CONSIDERATIONS AS WELL AS ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR HIGHER EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE AND BUSINESS PARTNERS BUT THE COMMISSION COULD EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT THIS NEW APPROACH TO SUPPORTING DISCONNECTED WORKERS. A PROPOSAL WOULD ALSO BE A MEANS OF DRAWING DISLOCATED WORKERS BACK INTO POST SCONDARY EDUCATION FOR UP SKILLING AND RE SKILLING. ADDITIONALLY THIS IS THE VERY POPULATION THAT IS CURRENTLY UNDER SERVED BY OUR TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS. AS WE DISCUSSED AT THE SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING LAST WEEK. GRAHAM STILL FEATURES OUTDATED RATIONING DEVICES THEY KEEP OUT STUDENTS OR OLDER WERE TAKING SOME TIME TO WORK AFTER HIGH SCHOOL. THESE ARE THE SAME STUDENTS IN THE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT PROGRAM WHERE THEY FACE A ONE IN EIGHT CHANCE OF RECEIVING AN AWARD DESPITE HAVING ELIGIBILITY BASED ON THEIR FINANCIAL STATUS AND ACADEMIC STAND. AND I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THESE GRANTS UNDER THE GOLDEN STATE EDUCATION ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND TRAINING GRANT. PROGRAM WOULD ALLOW US TO RE ENGAGE THE SAME POTENTIAL STUDENTS AND BRING THEM BACK INTO POST SECONDARY EDUCATION WELL IT DROPPING THE CAL GRANT EQUITY FRAMEWORK THAT. WE DISCUSSED LAST WEEK WOULD PROVIDE THEM WITH GREATER ACCESS TO FINANCIAL AID TO SUPPORT THEIR SUCCESS AFTER THE ANIMAL. AND ALL LEAVE MY COMMENTS THERE AND- BE PREPARED TO TAKE ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND APPRECIATE EVERYBODY'S OF BREVITY. OF WEBPAGES BEGIN WITH ONE QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE END- HE I WAS JUST GOING TO ASK WHAT THE RATIONALES FOR NOT ADDRESSING THE STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS WITH. THE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM A BROADER STRUCTURAL REDO SUCH AS THE SENATE'S DEBT FREE COLLEGE PROPOSAL RATHER THAN- THE OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE AROUND THAT. IN THE BUDGET. HAVE A LIKE TABLETS WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THANK YOU CHAIR FOR THE QUESTION THE ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT HAVE A DECISION ON ON THE PROPOSAL AT THIS MOMENT. I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT BOTH THE COUPLE YEARS BY DID AND THE MAIN REVISION INCLUDING BASEMENTS TO REDUCE THE AUTHOR- COST OF ATTENDANCE FOR STUDENTS AND THIS PROPOSED ON AUGMENTATION USE THE MAJORITY OF THE ONE TIME FUNDS THAT DID NOT HAVE THE SAME TYPE OF PRESSURE A LIABILITY. TO THE OVERALL STATE BUDGET SOME OF THESE INVESTMENT INCLUDING STUDENT HOUSING- INCREASED NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE CONFERENCE CHILD SAFETY SEAT COUNTS AND THE REDUCED TEXTBOOK COSTS FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE- FOUR BILLION. ONE TIME GENERAL FINE. WE WILL BE A SPY INTO DID YOU. TO EXCEL AS A LAW BECAUSE STUDENT HOUSING GRANT. WHICH FOCUSED ON EXPANDING AVAILABILITY OF AFFORDABLE SITTING HOUSE. THANK YOU I THINK. THAT IN SOME WAYS TALK SO WELL ROUNDED BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE REALLY COMMITTED TO A RESTRUCTURING OF THE- OF THE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM AND I THINK THAT WILL BE- I TALKED ABOUT IT EARLIER IN THE HEARING I THINK THAT WILL BE OUR CONVERSATION THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AND WE WERE REALLY. WHAT TO WORK ON THAT AND DO THAT SERIOUSLY SO APPRECIATE- YOUR ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION- SENATORS OTHER QUESTIONS. CENTERMAN. I WANNA BE KISSED- ASK A SIMILAR VERSION OF THE QUESTION I ASKED EARLIER- ON THE GOLDEN STATE EDUCATION ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND TRAINING GRANT PROGRAM- I COMPLETELY APPLAUD THE GOALS OF THIS- I GUESS MY QUESTION AGAIN IS TO WHAT DEGREE DOES THIS DUPLICATE EXISTING- PROGRAMS OUT THERE JUST BECAUSE ANY TIME AGAIN YOU CREATE A NEW PROGRAM- IT. MEANS THERE'S ONE MORE THING IN A STUDENT SEEKING AID NEEDS TO FIGURE OUT- IT'S ONE MORE STEP THEY HAVE TO TAKE AND IT'S MANY MORE PEOPLE YOU HAVE TO HIRE TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM- SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS- IS IT POSSIBLE TO ROUTE THIS THROUGH EXISTING PROGRAMS TO A DEGREE C. C. UNIQUE AND TO WHAT DEGREE DOES IT DUPLICATE. EXISTING PROGRAMS. NINE I GUESS THAT'S FOR THE PART IN FINANCE OR CCC. GOVERNMENT JOBS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION CENTER MAIN- THIS PROGRAM IS VERY SPECIFIC. ADDED TO THE PASSCODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS USING AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN AN AXE- IT IS STAYING TEN OF THE PROGRAM TO ASSIST INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC- THEREFORE THEY ARE NOT EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT DIRECTLY ADDRESS THESE NEEDS. OUR HOPE IS THAT WE USE IN THIS FEDERAL ONE TIME FUNDS WE CAN SUPPORT THE DISPLACED WORKERS WERE SEEKING BEING RESKILL AND UPSKILL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES OR ARE TRYING TO START A NEW BUSINESS- I'M ALSO HAPPY TO TAKE ANY OF THE FEEDBACK TO MY MANAGEMENT TEAM. ALL UP WITH THE- YES IT'S NO I THINK YOU'RE MICROPHONE- SORRY LET ME JUST FOLLOW UP HERE. IT IS A NEW PROGRAM I GET THAT BUT- TO WHAT DEGREE DO ITS PURPOSE SEES- YOU KNOW COULD THEY BE ROUTED THROUGH EXISTING PROGRAMS OR DO YOU NEED TO ESTABLISH SOMETHING NEW TO ALLOCATE THIS. PARTICULAR SET OF AID. WE ARE LOOKING AT HOW THE FEDERAL FUNDS ARE STRUCTURED- TWO US SEES INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN DISPLACED AND UCLA- DIFFERENT CAMPUSES WHERE HOPING TO HAVE IT BE APPROACHED- HE HE BACK TO MINE- COLIC BREANNA PRINCE WHO HAS WORKED ON IT. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR AFTER YOUR QUESTION SENATOR MEN I WOULD ECHO GOT REALIZED THAT EARLIER COMMENTS THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE SEEING THIS IS A PROGRAM TO REALLY DIRECT YEAH THE MEDIA NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS. WHO'VE BEEN DISPLACED DUE TO THE COLD IN NINETEEN PANDEMIC SO WELL YES WE DO THAT THE STATE HAS A LARGE VARIETY OF FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS THAT SERVE STUDENTS THIS PROGRAM IS REALLY TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO DISPLACED WORKERS- MANY OF WHOM WE ARE NOT CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN AN INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION SO WE'RE SEEING THIS AS A WAY. TO BETTER ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS IN THE MOMENT. AND THEN I GUESS I GUESS MY ONLY YOU KNOW WITHOUT KNOWING ALL THE SPECIFICS AND I TRUST YOU GUYS TO DO THE NECESSARY RESEARCH AND- BUT I GUESS MY- BROADER POINT WOULD BE THAT ANY TIME YOU SET UP A NEW PROGRAM. EIGHT IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET RELIEF OUT QUICKLY. THAT'S NOT THE WAY TO DO IT IF YOU'RE TRYING TO ACTUALLY DO THAT IMMEDIATELY TRY TO. REACH OUT TO DISPLACE COVERT STUDENTS ARE WORKERS- I THINK IT'S ALWAYS MORE EFFECTIVE TO USE EXISTING PATHWAYS THAT ESTABLISH THAT STUDENTS AND WORKERS ARE AWARE OF- THEY HAVE SOME PENETRATION AND STAFF AND ALL THAT RATHER THAN TRY TO BUILD UP SOMETHING NEW SO. I GUESS MY STRONG BIAS WOULD BE TO SAY THAT IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO ROUTE THESE FUNDS THROUGH. EXISTING PATHWAYS AND PROGRAMS- THAT WOULD BE FAR PREFERABLE THAN TRYING TO CREATE SOMETHING BRAND NEW ON. BUT YEAH I CAN I TRUST YOU GUYS AS FAR AS- YOU KNOW. TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY AND LOOKING AT THAT POINT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR MEN- THAT COMPLETES- THAT ITEM AND- I APPRECIATE THE- THE COMMENTS AND WE'VE BEEN CLEAR ABOUT CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'RE STILL GONNA HAVE. WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO THE LAST ITEM- ON THE AGENDA ISSUE SIX VARIOUS MAY REVISION PROPOSALS FOR THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE IN HASTINGS COLLEGE OF THE LAW.

SHOW JUST START OFF- WE'LL START OFF WITH THE CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS BECAUSE ONE THE CALIFORNIANS FOR ALL COLLEGE SERVICE PROGRAM. REVISION OF THE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE POINT TWO MILLION ONE TIME OF WHICH TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE POINT FOUR MILLION AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT FUNDING AND FORTY FIVE POINT EIGHT MILLION OF WHICH IS GENERAL FUND FOR THE CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS. TO CREATE THE CALIFORNIANS FOR ALL COLLEGE SERVICE PROGRAM IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM AND THE CALIFORNIA JUNIOR COLLEGES. THIS PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE UP TO TWELVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PART TIME JOB OPPORTUNITY TO COLLEGE STUDENTS AND CRITICAL ISSUE AREAS SUCH AS CLIMATE ACTION EDUCATION AND YOUTH DEVELOPMENT. HELP IN DISASTER RESPONSE. WORKING IN THAT. WILL GAIN. EXPERIENCE WACHTER THEIR- I WILL BE ELIGIBLE. FOR UP TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN COMPENSATION VIA SKYPE AND CALLER SHIP. NEXT I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THE HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT HOUSING PROPOSAL. A MEMBER OF THE FOUR BILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND INVESTMENT IN HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT HOUSING- OUT EVENLY OVER TWO YEARS TWO MILLION TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND TWO BILLION AND TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL FINANCE AUTHORITY WIL ADMINISTER GRANTS THE THREE PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION AND- STUDENT HOUSING PROPOSAL AIMED TO ADDRESS HOUSING INSECURITY BY COVERING THE UP FRONT COST OF HOUSING CONSTRUCTION OR HOUSING ACQUISITION AND RENOVATION AND INCREASING THE AVAILABILITY OF LOW COST HOUSING TO DIRECTLY. ADDRESS STUDENT DOCTOR TENDED. NEXT I'LL BE TALKING BACK TO REACH CHARACTERISTICS AND YOU CAN CLASS. MAY REVISION INCLUDING IN THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH BUDGET AIMED AT ALIGNING HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS AND REGIONAL WORKFORCE NEED. IN MINISTRATION ALLOCATING THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND SET ASIDE FROM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM FOR REGIONAL TEACHERS SIXTEEN COLLABORATIVE. THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH. WOULD PROVIDE GRANTS TO COLLABORATIVE THAT INCLUDES. AT LEAST ONE CAMPUS WHEN ALL THREE PUBLIC SEGMENT PRE OCCUPATIONAL PATHWAYS THAT LEAD TO HIGH PAYING IN DEMAND JOBS AND A DOCTOR RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE HIGHER EDUCATION RECOVERY WITH EQUITY TAX FOR. LASTLY I'LL BE TALKING AT THE HASTINGS COLLEGE OF THE LAW. THE MAYOR VERSION IS THREE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT AN ALTERNATIVE CAMPUS PUBLIC SAFETY PROGRAM HE RECENTLY IS STATING GENERATED DURING THE COPA NINETEEN CAN'T SHUT DOWN THE PILOT WHAT HAD BECOME A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PROGRAM. AND MAKING THE FUNDS AVAILABLE OVER THREE YEARS WELL I HATE TO HATE THANK YOU EXTEND IT AND PRESERVE IT BENEFITS. WITHOUT MY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE AND ARE ALSO JOINED BY REPRESENTATIVES FROM HASTINGS THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL PLANT THE GORY THE OFFICE OF HEALTH PLANNING AND RESEARCH AND HEALTH AND CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I DO KNOW THAT THERE'S- PEOPLE. FOR ANSWERING QUESTIONS IN ADDITION TO OUR FOUR PANELISTS WILL GO TO THE OHIO'S OFFICE. FACING CONSTANT TORRICELLI L. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME ALL FOCUSED ON WHAT IS THE LARGEST PROPOSAL WHICH IS THAT A STUDENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROPOSAL. WELL HERE WE DON'T HAVE- HARD RECOMMENDATION AND I'LL ALSO POINT OUT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT YET RELEASED THE ASSOCIATED TRAILER LEGISLATION. SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO PROVIDE ON UNTIL THAT'S RELEASED. BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE DID WANT TO RAISE A COUPLE OF KEY ISSUES FOR YOU TO CONSIDER AS YOU'RE WEIGHING THIS PROPOSAL. THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE IS THAT ON THE SURFACE THIS WOULD BE A NEW DIRECTION FOR THE STATE. OF. AND SUPPORTING ACADEMIC FACILITY PROJECTS- WITH HOUSING PROJECTS BEING SUPPORTED. BY STUDENT FEE REVENUE- IT'S ALSO A NEW DIRECTION IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING FORD ABILITY AND HISTORICALLY THE STATE HAS TRIED TO ADDRESS AFFORDABILITY BY EXPANDING FINANCIAL AID. BECAUSE THIS WOULD BE A NEW DIRECTION THERE ARE A COUPLE OF UNCERTAINTIES TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON AFFORDABILITY- WE DON'T HAVE HARD ESTIMATES FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON. HOW MANY BEDS THIS WOULD- CONSTRUCT BUT- BASEDON DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. IT'S ALSO LIKELY THAT THE PROPOSAL WOULD- FIND- SPANNED A BED FOR A FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS BUT WOULDN'T COVER. ME FOR ALL FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS. THAT MEANS YOU HAVE SOME FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS WHO WOULD WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT OTHER STUDENTS WHO MIGHT NOT. ANOTHER ISSUE TO THINK ABOUT IS IMPLEMENTATION ABOUT WHAT WE WANT WE'VE TALKED TO THE SEGMENTS OF THE SEGMENTS HAD A PARTICULARLY UNIVERSITIES AND SOME YEARS RAMPED UP STUDENT HOUSING- SO THEY THEY HAVE DEMONSTRATED SOME ABILITY TO DO THAT WE'VE ALSO HEARD- FROM CAMPUSES IN THE PAST THOUGH THAT THEY DO FACE SOME LOCAL CONSTRAINTS IN EXPANDING HOUSING- TO THE EXTENT THAT- THEY FACE CONSTRAINTS WITH THIS PROPOSAL THAT THAT COULD IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO SPEND DOWN THE FUNDS. AND THE FINAL THING FINALLY SHOULD CONSIDER IS A GIVEN THAT THIS WOULD BE SORT OF A NEW WAY OF APPROACHING HOUSING STUDENT HOUSING. WHICH WOULD CONSTRAIN. OUR RENTS FOR STUDENTS. TO RAISE A QUESTION ONCE HOT ONCE THE FACILITIES ARE BUILT- WHERE THEY HAVE ADEQUATE FUNDING TO MAINTAIN THE FACILITIES LONG TERM. ON THAT NOTE I AGAIN FOR THE SECOND TIME I LEAVE IT THERE AND- HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE REPRESENTATIVE ON THE PHONE. THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH. YES GOT MORGAN NO NO FURTHER COMMENT ON THAT ON THE K. THROUGH TWELVE- SIXTEEN PROPOSAL THAT DLF PRESENTED ON HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS IF NEEDED.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I ONE QUESTION FOR THE REPRESENTATIVE OF HASTINGS BUT BEFORE I DO THAT I'M JUST GOING TO MAKE A COMMENT. THE TWO OUT OF THREE THESE PROGRAMS THOSE SERVICE PROGRAM AND THE STUDENT HOUSING. STILL LACKED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF DETAIL ON THE RATHER THAN ASK QUESTIONS.

IN A REALLY SORRY FOR THE HASTINGS REPRESENTATIVE BECAUSE I DID NOT HAVE THE PAPERWORK THAT I MEANT TO BRING WITH ME A SENATE REPORT TO TINO. BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION- AIDS SCHOLARSHIP OR AID PROGRAM AND IT INVOLVES- OF JERRY STUDENTS OF SOME I THINK ARE FOREIGN STUDENTS.
