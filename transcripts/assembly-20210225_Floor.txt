AS AN ACADEMIC ALL AMERICAN SWIMMER A COLLEGIATE ROWER AND A WATER POLO PLAYER FOR TWO YEARS AND MY DAUGHTER WAS -- COLLEGIATE GROWER AS WELL AS AN ATHLETE I HAVE SEEN FIRSTHAND THE IMPACT THAT SPORTS HAVE ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF GIRLS AND WOMEN AS THEY PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO CULTIVATE LEADERSHIP AND GROW SELF ESTEEM I MYSELF LEARN THE SKILLS OF DISCIPLINE AND PERSEVERANCE WHICH SERVED ME WELL IN THIS BODY PARTICIPATING IN ATHLETICS HAS LASTING IMPACTS FOR EXAMPLE EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED FEMALE EXECUTIVES GREW UP PLAYING SPORTS RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THAT GIRLS WHO PARTICIPATE IN SPORTS ARE LESS LIKELY TO SMOKE EXPERIENCE TEENAGE PREGNANCY AND HAVE LOWER RATES OF DEPRESSION THAT SAID NOT ALL GIRLS AND WOMEN HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO SPORTS OR TRAIN ARE TREATED WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF RESPECT BY THEIR PEERS AND ADMINISTRATORS THE WOMEN'S SPORTS FOUNDATION COLLECTS AND PUBLISHES DATA ON GENDER DISPARITY AND WITHIN ATHLETICS ANNUALLY BOYS GET ONE POINT ONE MILLION MORE SPORTS OPPORTUNITY THAN GIRLS I MYSELF HAD TO SWIM ON THE BOYS SWIM TEAM SINCE IT WAS NO GIRLS SWIM TEAM AT MY HIGH SCHOOL WOMEN ATHLETES AND COACHES FACE EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT BIASES THAT LIMIT THEIR OPPORTUNITIES AND DEPRIVE THEM OF SELF IMPROVEMENT AND HINDERS THEIR QUALITY OF PLAY THIS RESOLUTION BRINGS AWARENESS TO THE DISPARITY THAT REMAINS AND HOPEFULLY INSPIRES GIRLS AND YOUNG WOMEN
