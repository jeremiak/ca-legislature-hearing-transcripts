00:29:53.825 --> 00:29:54.926
OUR FOCUS ON THE RISKS OF

00:29:54.993 --> 00:29:56.427
PETROLEUM DEPENDENCE AND DEMANDS

00:29:56.494 --> 00:29:58.796
THAT WE CONSIDER HOW WE WILL

00:29:58.863 --> 00:30:00.431
TRANSITION AWAY FROM FOSSIL

IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THAT

00:30:08.606 --> 00:30:11.075
TRANSITION HOW BEST TO MANAGE A

00:30:11.142 --> 00:30:12.177
DECLINING RESOURCE AN AGING

00:30:12.243 --> 00:30:14.913
INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS ALSO A

00:30:14.979 --> 00:30:17.081
SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF JOBS AND

00:30:17.148 --> 00:30:19.083
REVENUE THAT MUST BE PLAYED.

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:20.351
THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM THAT WILL

00:30:20.418 --> 00:30:22.687
SOLVE ITSELF AND THE CLOCK IS

00:30:22.754 --> 00:30:24.422

THAT WE AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE

00:39:08.145 --> 00:39:10.481
DON'T JUST. PINPOINT ONE ISSUE

COAST LINE. TO HAVE A MASTER

00:39:18.689 --> 00:39:20.791
PLAN. AND IN A COORDINATED

00:39:20.858 --> 00:39:22.226
MASTER PLAN. THAT WORKS TOGETHER

00:39:22.293 --> 00:39:25.062
ANY COORDINATION WITH EACH OTHER

00:39:25.129 --> 00:39:26.697
SINCE THEIR NEXT DOOR TO EACH

00:39:26.764 --> 00:39:27.932
OTHER. BECAUSE WHAT WE FOUND.

00:39:27.998 --> 00:39:30.034
DURING THIS. IT DURING THIS TIME

00:39:30.101 --> 00:39:32.069

SIMILAR MASTER PLAN. THAT THE

00:39:54.792 --> 00:39:58.562
SMOOTH. SO AND AS WE CONTINUE ON

ECONOMY. WHEN THIS HAPPENED WE

00:40:13.677 --> 00:40:16.313

ARTIFICIAL REEF PROGRAM SO LONG

01:06:30.152 --> 01:06:31.687
AS THE STATE ASSUMES TITLE IN

CRITERIA CALIFORNIA DO YOU HAVE

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.042
AN ARTIFICIAL REEF PROGRAM. BUT

01:06:53.109 --> 01:06:54.677
IT WAS FOCUSED ON CONSTRUCTING

01:06:54.744 --> 01:06:56.779
REEFS THAT MIMIC NATURAL REEFS

REMOVAL- BUT NEVERTHELESS-

01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:19.635
BECAUSE WE DID NOT HAVE A STATE

01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:22.071
LAWFUL REMOVAL WAS STILL

01:07:22.138 --> 01:07:24.440
REQUIRED. BEGINNING IN NINETEEN

01:07:24.507 --> 01:07:26.108
NINETY EIGHT THERE WERE SEVERAL

RESOURCES LEGACY ACT. THE BILL

01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:49.832
PASSED IN LARGE PART BECAUSE IT

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:52.501
REQUIRED A ROBUST SCIENTIFIC

BENEFITS TO THE MARINE

01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:59.442
ENVIRONMENT A FULL REMOVAL

01:07:59.508 --> 01:08:02.545
VERSUS PARTIAL REMOVAL AND THEN

01:08:02.611 --> 01:08:04.680
NOT IN OUR OFFICE WOULD RESULT

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:06.515
IN A DETERMINATION OF WHICH

01:08:06.582 --> 01:08:08.951
OPTION WOULD RESULT IN A NET

OIL PLATFORM IN AND OF ITSELF-

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:30.840
CREATED ECOLOGICAL BENEFIT. THE

01:08:30.906 --> 01:08:32.675
BILL ALSO PASSED BECAUSE THERE

01:08:32.741 --> 01:08:34.777
WAS A COST SAVING OUR OUR

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:53.262
DECOMMISSIONING I WILL FOCUS ON

01:08:53.329 --> 01:08:55.231
SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WILL

01:08:55.297 --> 01:08:56.699
NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AS EACH

01:08:56.765 --> 01:08:59.101
PLATFORM IS REVIEWED ON ITS OWN

01:08:59.168 --> 01:09:03.873
MERITS FIRST ECOLOGICAL ISSUES.

01:09:03.939 --> 01:09:06.141
ALSO NEED TO CONSIDER SETTING

01:09:06.208 --> 01:09:08.911
AND PRESENCE OF OTHER HABITAT IN

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:10.112
THE VICINITY EACH PLATFORM IS

01:09:10.179 --> 01:09:11.881
DIFFERENT THEY RANGE IN DEPTH

01:09:11.947 --> 01:09:15.918
FROM THIRTY EIGHT TO ALMOST

01:09:15.985 --> 01:09:16.886

NAVIGATIONAL SAFETY REQUIREMENTS

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:26.662
. SO THAT NOW WE HAVE TO

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:27.997
CONSIDER HOW THE LOSS OF THE TOP

01:09:28.063 --> 01:09:29.965
OF THE POPS FOR ME AFFECT

01:09:30.032 --> 01:09:30.566

HAS NOT OCCURRED IN STATE

01:25:46.574 --> 01:25:48.776
WATERS. HOWEVER A COUPLE OF

01:25:48.843 --> 01:25:51.112
YEARS AGO- THE STATE LANDS

01:25:51.179 --> 01:25:53.481
COMMISSION DID TERMINATE I STATE

01:25:53.548 --> 01:25:55.216
PIPELINE LEASE THAT CONNECTED A

01:25:55.283 --> 01:25:56.951
FEDERAL FEDERAL PLATFORM

01:25:57.018 --> 01:25:58.186
PRODUCTION PLATFORMS TO THE LONG

01:25:58.253 --> 01:26:04.492

01:26:07.862 --> 01:26:09.297
FEDERAL PLATFORM OKAY. IT WAS AN

01:26:09.364 --> 01:26:10.665
ACTUAL TO GET THIS STATE HAVE

01:26:10.732 --> 01:26:12.734
BEEN SAY IN ALL THE FED PLATFORM

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:14.235
THAT ARE OUT. THEN I JUST WANT

01:26:14.302 --> 01:26:15.003
TO REMIND COLLEAGUES. THE

01:26:15.069 --> 01:26:16.905
PLATTS. OIL SPILL IT HUNT BEACH

01:26:16.971 --> 01:26:18.540
IT WOULD NOT COME THE PLAQUE.

01:26:18.606 --> 01:26:20.041
AND ANCHORED. THE PIPELINE THAT

01:26:20.108 --> 01:26:22.210
RAN FROM THE OFFICE WORK TO THE

01:26:22.277 --> 01:26:23.778
ON TO THE SHORE. THAT IS WHERE

01:26:23.845 --> 01:26:25.246
WE GOT TO GET CRITICAL TO WATCH

01:26:25.313 --> 01:26:27.849
THE BANKERS AND ALL THE SHIPS

01:26:27.916 --> 01:26:29.284
THAT WE HAVE IN THE PORT. AND

01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:31.786
THEN ONE OTHER QUESTION I'M

01:26:31.853 --> 01:26:33.154
GONNA GO FORTH OF DAMON. SO THAT

01:26:33.221 --> 01:26:35.056
WE'RE NOT USING THAT MUCH OIL IN

01:26:35.123 --> 01:26:36.457
CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA CONSUMES

01:26:36.524 --> 01:26:38.693
ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION GALLONS

01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:41.129
OF OILA DAY. SO FOR NOT

01:26:41.195 --> 01:26:42.797
PRODUCING IT IN CALIFORNIA STILL

01:26:42.864 --> 01:26:44.933
GOING TO COME HERE TO BE

01:26:44.999 --> 01:26:47.902
REFINED. FUEL WE'RE NOT GOING TO

01:26:47.969 --> 01:26:49.971
CHANGE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:26:50.038 --> 01:26:52.407
FROM OIL TO ELECTRICITY

01:26:52.473 --> 01:26:54.642
OVERNIGHT AS CAN BE A SLOW

01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:56.411
PROCESS WE CAN'T GET TOO FAR

01:26:56.477 --> 01:26:57.378
AHEAD OF THE GAME AND INCLUDING

01:26:57.445 --> 01:26:59.047
THANK YOU FOR THAT BUT I JUST

01:26:59.113 --> 01:27:00.982
WANT A CAR FACTS I THINK THE

01:27:01.049 --> 01:27:02.650
POINT THAT DAMON WAS THIS AT. IN

01:27:02.717 --> 01:27:04.385
WAS RELATED TO THE AMOUNT OF

01:27:04.452 --> 01:27:05.253
PRODUCTION THAT IS BEING

01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:07.655
GENERATED FROM THE OFFSHORE

01:27:07.722 --> 01:27:09.390
FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT

01:27:09.457 --> 01:27:11.693
OFFSHORE PRODUCTION AND IN THE

01:27:11.759 --> 01:27:13.161
STATE OF CALIFORNIA ACCOUNTS FOR

01:27:13.227 --> 01:27:17.065
ONE THIRD. OF 1% OF ALL US OIL

01:27:17.131 --> 01:27:18.566
PRODUCTION I THINK THAT WAS

01:27:18.633 --> 01:27:21.002
WE'RE STILL CONSUMING ONE POINT

01:27:21.069 --> 01:27:22.704

THERE THAT I. HAVE SEEN AT

THE COMMISSION AND THE STATE

01:32:41.455 --> 01:32:43.758
ACTUALLY DID NOT HAVE ANY KIND

01:35:13.941 --> 01:35:16.010
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK- JENNIFER I

01:35:16.077 --> 01:35:19.980
HAVE A QUESTION. THE YOU

01:35:20.047 --> 01:35:22.817
MENTIONED THE COST OF THE FIVE

01:35:22.883 --> 01:35:24.351
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND

01:35:24.418 --> 01:35:26.253
UNFUNDED LIABILITIES POTENTIALLY

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:28.422
. WHAT IS THE COST TO AND JUST

01:35:28.489 --> 01:35:30.191
AN APPROXIMATE I KNOW THAT EVERY

01:35:30.257 --> 01:35:32.693
POT FORMS ARE DIFFERENT AND THE

01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:35.429
LAMP AND- THE SIZE EVERYTHING

01:35:35.496 --> 01:35:36.664
AND HOW LONG IT'S BEEN IN THERE

01:35:36.730 --> 01:35:39.500
AND ETCETERA- WHAT WHAT IT COSTS

01:35:39.567 --> 01:35:40.835
TO DECOMMISSION LIKE ONE

01:35:40.901 --> 01:35:43.304
PLATFORM. LIKE ON AVERAGE YEAH

01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:45.239
SO WHEN I TALKED ABOUT THAT

01:35:45.306 --> 01:35:46.507
APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED

01:35:46.574 --> 01:35:47.575
MILLION AN UNDIVIDED LOT

01:35:47.641 --> 01:35:49.243
LIABILITIES THAT HAS TO DO WITH

01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:51.078
THE LONG BEACH OPERATIONS CALMLY

01:35:51.145 --> 01:35:52.613
SO THOSE ARE THE FOUR APPLE OIL

01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:55.983
ISLANDS AND THAT- WELLS THAT-

01:35:56.050 --> 01:35:57.451
PRODUCE UNDER AND THEY'RE

01:35:57.518 --> 01:35:59.453
LOCATED UNDERLYING THE PORT OF

01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:00.221
LONG BEACH. THAT'S A THAT'S A

01:36:00.287 --> 01:36:01.822
TOTALLY SEPARATE UNIQUE

01:36:01.889 --> 01:36:04.758
SITUATION- THAT- BECAUSE OF THE

01:36:04.825 --> 01:36:06.961
HISTORY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF

01:36:07.027 --> 01:36:10.631
THAT AREA- FOR PLATFORMS- ALL I

01:36:10.698 --> 01:36:14.502
CAN. REALLY PROVIDE AS INSIGHT

01:36:14.568 --> 01:36:16.904
AND I GAS OR AN ESTIMATE IS WHAT

01:36:16.971 --> 01:36:18.572
WERE AND ANTICIPATING WITH

01:36:18.639 --> 01:36:21.775
PLATFORM HOLLY- BECAUSE REALLY

01:36:21.842 --> 01:36:24.578
IT COMES DOWN TO- AT. THE

01:36:24.645 --> 01:36:26.147
SPECIFICS OF THE PLUGGING AND

01:36:26.213 --> 01:36:27.781
ABANDONMENT OF THE WELLS WHICH

01:36:27.848 --> 01:36:30.050
EVERY SINGLE WELL EVEN ON ONE

01:36:30.117 --> 01:36:32.319
PLATFORM CAN BE VASTLY DIFFERENT

01:36:32.386 --> 01:36:34.722
IN TERMS OF THEIR COMPLEXITY-

01:36:34.788 --> 01:36:37.925
AND- THEN THE PLATFORM ITSELF

01:36:37.992 --> 01:36:38.626
AND THE ASSOCIATED

01:36:38.692 --> 01:36:40.828
INFRASTRUCTURE SO. WHAT I CAN

01:36:40.895 --> 01:36:43.264
TELL YOU IS BASED ON WHAT EXXON

01:36:43.330 --> 01:36:45.299
HAS- ESTIMATED IN THEIR COURT

01:36:45.366 --> 01:36:47.501
FILINGS IT'S ABOUT THREE HUNDRED

01:36:47.568 --> 01:36:49.069
FIFTY MILLION BUT THAT WAS PRE

01:36:49.136 --> 01:36:50.704
PANDEMIC AND WE'VE ONLY YOU KNOW

01:36:50.771 --> 01:36:53.040
GONE UP IN COSTS BECAUSE OF THE

01:36:53.107 --> 01:36:55.042
PROLONGED DELAY IN BEING ABLE TO

01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:56.944
PURSUE THE PLUGGING AND

01:36:57.011 --> 01:36:58.412
ABANDONMENT- PLUS THE HUNDRED

01:36:58.479 --> 01:37:02.416
AND TEN- MILLION DOLLARS. THAT

01:37:02.483 --> 01:37:03.884
WAS APPROPRIATED I'M THE STATE

01:37:03.951 --> 01:37:10.958
LEGISLATURE. PLUS I MEAN IT'S A

01:37:11.025 --> 01:37:11.959
PLATFORM HOLLY APPEARS TWENTY

01:37:12.026 --> 01:37:14.461
ONE SOUTH OUR BEST GUESS FOR

01:37:14.528 --> 01:37:15.529
HALL IS IT'S GOING TO BE FOUR

01:37:15.596 --> 01:37:16.897
HUNDRED AND FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

01:37:16.964 --> 01:37:19.500
DOLLARS. MY AND MY NEXT QUESTION

01:37:19.567 --> 01:37:25.673
IS. WOULD YOU WOULD YOUR AGENCY

01:37:25.739 --> 01:37:28.409
OR FOR WHICH AGENCY WOULD IT BE-

01:37:28.475 --> 01:37:30.177
WHO COULD GIVE US KIND OF LIKE A

01:37:30.244 --> 01:37:31.812
- AND BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE'RE

01:37:31.879 --> 01:37:32.413
LOOKING AT TWENTY ONE BILLION

01:37:32.479 --> 01:37:36.116
DOLLARS IN- BUT IN REVENUE. FOR

01:37:36.183 --> 01:37:38.852
THE STATE AND THAT AND THEN

01:37:38.919 --> 01:37:39.820
AFFECTS THREE HUNDRED SIXTY

01:37:39.887 --> 01:37:42.723
THOUSAND JOBS. HAVE WE AWARE

01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:47.528
WILL OR WHO WILL BE LOOKING INTO

01:37:47.595 --> 01:37:48.662
HOW WE PLACE THAT TWENTY ONE

01:37:48.729 --> 01:37:51.198
BILLION AND HELP THE THREE

01:37:51.265 --> 01:37:52.099
HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND

01:37:52.166 --> 01:37:53.734
INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE JOBS WITH

01:37:53.801 --> 01:37:56.337
THAT BE YOUR COMMISSION OR WHAT

01:37:56.403 --> 01:37:59.406
OTHER AGENCIES OUT THERE. THAT

01:37:59.473 --> 01:38:00.841
IS A GREAT QUESTION I THINK

01:38:00.908 --> 01:38:04.578
THAT- A LOT OF THAT IS BEING

01:38:04.645 --> 01:38:06.180
LOOKED AT IN THE PROPOSED

01:38:06.247 --> 01:38:08.315
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- THROUGH THE

01:38:08.382 --> 01:38:11.418
STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL GOBIZ-

01:38:11.485 --> 01:38:14.388
AT CAL JAM. OUR AGENCY IN TERMS

01:38:14.455 --> 01:38:16.023
OF- THE ENERGY COMMISSION IN

01:38:16.090 --> 01:38:17.791
TERMS OF THE WHOLE ENERGY

01:38:17.858 --> 01:38:20.661
TRANSITION- BOTH THAT LOOKING AT

01:38:20.728 --> 01:38:22.396
HOW WE NOT ONLY TRANSITION OUR

01:38:22.463 --> 01:38:24.198
ENERGY PRODUCTION AND

01:38:24.265 --> 01:38:26.433
CONSUMPTION BUT ALSO LOOKING AT

01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:27.501
WHAT THAT MEANS FOR A TRIP

01:38:27.568 --> 01:38:29.536
DRESSED. TRANSITION FOR WORKERS

01:38:29.603 --> 01:38:31.238
WHAT THAT MEANS FOR- PLUGGING

01:38:31.305 --> 01:38:33.007
AND ABANDONING AND DEALING WITH

01:38:33.073 --> 01:38:34.908
OUR ORPHAN AND LEGACY WELLS AND

01:38:34.975 --> 01:38:36.644
HOW WE TRANSITION THOSE WORKERS

01:38:36.710 --> 01:38:38.445
I AM NOT THE BEST PERSON TO

01:38:38.512 --> 01:38:39.780
SPEAK TO THAT. ALTHOUGH ARE

01:38:39.847 --> 01:38:42.049
COMMISSION PLAYS A SMALL ROLE IN

01:38:42.116 --> 01:38:43.817
THAT TRANSITION- AND I THINK

01:38:43.884 --> 01:38:45.853
THERE MAY BE OTHER PANEL MEMBERS

01:38:45.919 --> 01:38:47.721
TODAY THAT CAN SPEAK MORE

01:38:47.788 --> 01:38:49.290
DIRECTLY TO THAT BUT I KNOW THAT

01:38:49.356 --> 01:38:51.258
THAT IS A HUGE PRIORITY AND THE

01:38:51.325 --> 01:38:52.993
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THAT'S BEING

01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:54.795
ADDRESSED ON MULTIPLE DIFFERENT

01:38:54.862 --> 01:38:56.030

STILL ON. THE COASTLINE ON IN MY

01:39:16.016 --> 01:39:18.819

GOVERNMENT'S DOING THEIR OWN

01:39:20.454 --> 01:39:22.056
INVESTIGATION AND ALL THAT OTHER

01:39:22.122 --> 01:39:24.058

WANNA CALL IT BECAUSE IT'S OUT

01:59:20.353 --> 01:59:22.221

01:59:22.288 --> 01:59:24.123
MOVING FORWARD HAVE TO REALIZE

01:59:24.190 --> 01:59:25.992
THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT I

01:59:26.058 --> 01:59:28.094
ONCE WORKED THERE NEED TO FIND

01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:30.630

02:13:01.306 --> 02:13:04.543
AN INTENTIONAL PROFESSION- AND

02:13:04.609 --> 02:13:10.882
THEY DON'T WANT. TO DO. SO I

02:13:10.949 --> 02:13:13.118
THINK. THAT AND MISSED YOU KNOW

02:13:13.185 --> 02:13:15.787
UNQUOTE JOSH. AND THEN LET'S

02:13:15.854 --> 02:13:17.255
TALK ABOUT JOB REACH FOR. IS IT

02:13:17.322 --> 02:13:21.393
SOME A CO OF SAN. THAT THAT YOU

02:13:21.460 --> 02:13:24.429
KNOW THESE GUYS WHEN I SAY GUYS

02:13:24.496 --> 02:13:25.530
IT'S NOT A WAY WILL TAKE. YOU

02:13:25.597 --> 02:13:27.866
KNOW WHATEVER IS. TO THEM. WELL

02:13:27.933 --> 02:13:29.201
THAT'S THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE THEY

02:13:29.267 --> 02:13:31.336
WANT TO DO WITH JOB. THEY WERE

02:13:31.403 --> 02:13:32.504
TRAINED TO DO AND WANT TO DO

02:13:32.571 --> 02:13:34.873
THAT. THAT THEY'RE PROUD TO DO

02:13:34.940 --> 02:13:36.241
AND WHEN YOU KNOW. THERE'S EIGHT

02:13:36.308 --> 02:13:37.642
HI WITHIN THE BUILDING TRADES

02:13:37.709 --> 02:13:39.244
BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR

02:13:39.311 --> 02:13:41.113
MEMBERS GOES HOME AT THE END OF

02:13:41.179 --> 02:13:43.448
THE DAY ARE GOES HOME AT THE END

02:13:43.515 --> 02:13:45.717
OF SHIPS AND THEY'RE TIRED. AND

02:13:45.784 --> 02:13:46.952
DIRTY BUT THEY HAVE BUILT

02:13:47.018 --> 02:13:49.688
SOMETHING THEY HAVE MADE IT

02:13:49.755 --> 02:13:50.655
SOMETHING. AND THE SENSE OF

02:13:50.722 --> 02:13:52.791
CRIED THEY GET FROM THAT IS

02:13:52.858 --> 02:13:54.226
NOTHING THAT YOU CAN YOU KNOW BE

02:13:54.292 --> 02:13:56.728
TRAINED THEM TO DO- THIS IS

02:13:56.795 --> 02:13:58.463
THEIR CHOSEN PROFESSION THIS IS

02:13:58.530 --> 02:14:00.065
WHO THEY ARE AND THAT'S HOW THEY

02:14:00.132 --> 02:14:02.200
IDENTIFY THEMSELVES. AND I THINK

02:14:02.267 --> 02:14:04.803
AS WE GO FORWARD IT'S IMPORTANT

02:14:04.870 --> 02:14:07.739
TO GIVE. YOU KNOW THE RISKS

02:14:07.806 --> 02:14:10.275
BACK. OF WHAT A TRADE MEANS TO

02:14:10.342 --> 02:14:11.877
ANOTHER PERSON AND YOU KNOW

02:14:11.943 --> 02:14:12.978
THAT'S WHY WE WERE NOT

02:14:13.044 --> 02:14:14.746
INTERESTED COLLECTIVELY IN THIS

02:14:14.813 --> 02:14:16.515
SENSE OF YOU KNOW THAT'S GOING

02:14:16.581 --> 02:14:18.483
TO PRODUCE JEFF TRANSITION.

02:14:18.550 --> 02:14:20.519
BECAUSE YOU KNOW OUR GUYS ARE

02:14:20.585 --> 02:14:22.053

02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:23.922
TRADE BUT THEY WEREN'T THEY

02:14:23.989 --> 02:14:25.590
INTENDED TO DO THAT THEY WORK TO

02:14:25.657 --> 02:14:27.526
DO THAT THEY TRAINED TO DO AND

02:14:27.592 --> 02:14:30.028
THAT THEY DO DAY IN AND DAY OUT.

02:14:30.095 --> 02:14:30.595

SLIDE PLEASE. MY INTEREST IN

02:17:41.586 --> 02:17:43.588
RIGS AS REEFS REALLY BEGAN IN

02:17:43.655 --> 02:17:48.326
GRADUATE SCHOOL WHERE I WAS A-

02:17:48.393 --> 02:17:50.562
SETTING THESE PLATFORMS. AND

02:17:50.629 --> 02:17:54.332
BEING ADVISED BY DR MILTON LOVE

02:17:54.399 --> 02:17:55.867
. I SCRIPT INSTITUTION OF

02:17:55.934 --> 02:17:59.004
OCEANOGRAPHY. WE WERE LOOKING AT

02:17:59.070 --> 02:18:01.039
THESE PLATFORMS WHICH FROM ONE

02:18:01.106 --> 02:18:02.273
SPEECH SHARE REALLY LOOK LIKE

02:18:02.340 --> 02:18:05.377
INDUSTRIAL MENACING GIANTS BUT

02:18:05.443 --> 02:18:07.078
WHEN YOU GO BELOW THE SURFACE

02:18:07.145 --> 02:18:09.881
THERE IS SO MUCH MORE AND AS

02:18:09.948 --> 02:18:11.216
PRODUCTION IS COMING TO AN END

02:18:11.282 --> 02:18:13.184
WE REALLY NEED TO ASK THE

02:18:13.251 --> 02:18:14.919
QUESTION NEXT SLIDE. OF WHAT

02:18:14.986 --> 02:18:17.922
HAPPENS WHEN THE OIL WELLS DRY

02:18:17.989 --> 02:18:20.492
UP. NEXT SLIDE. ENTER THIS

02:18:20.558 --> 02:18:21.826
ENGINEERING FEAT OF A LIFETIME

02:18:21.893 --> 02:18:23.228
HOW TO REMOVE THE STRUCTURE SOME

02:18:23.295 --> 02:18:24.462
THE SIZE OF THE EMPIRE STATE

02:18:24.529 --> 02:18:26.765
BUILDING FROM THE SEA FLOOR. AS

02:18:26.831 --> 02:18:28.800
WE'VE HEARD FROM PREVIOUS

02:18:28.867 --> 02:18:30.468
PRESENTATIONS TODAY THIS PROCESS

02:18:30.535 --> 02:18:32.170
OF DECOMMISSIONING CAN BE VERY

02:18:32.237 --> 02:18:35.106
TECHNICALLY COMPLEX AND HAVE

02:18:35.173 --> 02:18:37.142
SOME SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL

02:18:37.208 --> 02:18:39.010
CHALLENGES AS WELL NEXT SLIDE.

02:18:39.077 --> 02:18:40.412
SPECIALLY WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT

02:18:40.478 --> 02:18:42.814
BELOW THE SURFACE EVERY BEAM AND

02:18:42.881 --> 02:18:43.715
CROSSBEAM OF CALIFORNIANS

02:18:43.782 --> 02:18:45.617
PLATFORMS ARE COVERED IN MARINE

02:18:45.684 --> 02:18:47.519
LIFE WE SKI SEA SCALLOPS AND

02:18:47.585 --> 02:18:50.055
ENEMIES. SCHOOLS OF JACK

02:18:50.121 --> 02:18:52.323
MACKEREL NEXT SLIDE. WE EVEN SEE

02:18:52.390 --> 02:18:54.426
SOME OF OUR STATE SALTWATER FISH

02:18:54.492 --> 02:18:56.227
THAT GARIBALDI THAT NASA MAKE

02:18:56.294 --> 02:18:57.462
THEIR PERMANENT HOME ON THESE

02:18:57.529 --> 02:19:04.469
OFFSHORE STRUCTURES. NEXT SLIDE. RIGS TO REEF PROVIDES AN

02:19:04.536 --> 02:19:05.770
ALTERNATIVE TO COMPLETELY

02:19:05.837 --> 02:19:07.672
REMOVING THE POP FROM JACKET

02:19:07.739 --> 02:19:09.107
FROM THE WATERCOLUMN IN WHICH

02:19:09.174 --> 02:19:10.475
THE STRUCTURE IS MODIFIED SO

02:19:10.542 --> 02:19:12.243
THAT IT CAN CONTINUE TO FUNCTION

02:19:12.310 --> 02:19:15.146
AS AN ARTIFICIAL REEF. DIRECTORY

02:19:15.213 --> 02:19:16.748
OF CONVERSION THE WELL IS GOING

02:19:16.815 --> 02:19:18.850
TO BE SEALED AND CAPPED AND THE

02:19:18.917 --> 02:19:20.018
OIL COMPANIES WILL RETAIN

02:19:20.085 --> 02:19:22.554
LIABILITY FOR THAT WELL IN

02:19:22.620 --> 02:19:23.488
PERPETUITY BUT THE PLATFORM

02:19:23.555 --> 02:19:25.690
JACKET WHICH TO MEET COAST GUARD

02:19:25.757 --> 02:19:28.059
REGULATIONS WOULD BE CUT DOWN

02:19:28.126 --> 02:19:29.527
EIGHTY FIVE FEET BELOW THE WATER

02:19:29.594 --> 02:19:31.362
SURFACE TO ALLOW FOR SHIPS TO

02:19:31.429 --> 02:19:32.897
SAFELY DROPPED OVER. AND NOT

02:19:32.964 --> 02:19:34.399
REMAINING PLATFORM JACKET WOULD

02:19:34.466 --> 02:19:36.868
REMAIN IN THE WATER COLUMN TO

02:19:36.935 --> 02:19:39.204
FUNCTION AS AN ARTIFICIAL REEF

02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:42.273
BACKSIDE. BUT BEFORE WE GET TOO

02:19:42.340 --> 02:19:43.842
FAR AHEAD OF OURSELVES WHAT

02:19:43.908 --> 02:19:45.143
REALLY IS AN ARTIFICIAL REEF.

02:19:45.210 --> 02:19:47.112
YOU CAN'T JUST SAY EVERYTHING WE

02:19:47.178 --> 02:19:48.980
PUT IN THE OCEAN IS GOING TO

02:19:49.047 --> 02:19:50.882
MAKE FOR. GOOD HABITAT NEXT

02:19:50.949 --> 02:19:54.252
SLIDE RESEARCHERS HAVE PLACED RE

02:19:54.319 --> 02:19:55.386
FALLS ON THE SEA FLOOR TO LOOK

02:19:55.453 --> 02:19:58.523
AT HOW MARINE LIFE COLONIZES AND

02:19:58.590 --> 02:20:00.625
THEY- LOOK AT COLONIZATION RATES

02:20:00.692 --> 02:20:02.260
AND USE A SAYS THE STUDY POINT

02:20:02.327 --> 02:20:05.630
NEXT LINE. ARTISTS EVEN HAVE

02:20:05.697 --> 02:20:07.599
THEIR OWN TAKE BY. LOOKING AT

02:20:07.665 --> 02:20:09.234
HOW THEIR INSTALLATIONS ON THE

02:20:09.300 --> 02:20:10.902
SEA FLOOR CAN BE ENHANCED BY.

02:20:10.969 --> 02:20:12.270
THE DEVELOPMENT OF MARINE LIFE

02:20:12.337 --> 02:20:14.906
NEXT SLIDE. BUT WHAT MAKES AN

02:20:14.973 --> 02:20:17.041
OIL PLATFORM A GOOD CANDIDATE

02:20:17.108 --> 02:20:19.177
FOR AN ARTIFICIAL REEF NOW THIS

02:20:19.244 --> 02:20:20.512
SICK REALLY LIES IN THE

02:20:20.578 --> 02:20:23.114
STRUCTURE ITSELF FROM SEA FLOOR

02:20:23.181 --> 02:20:24.983
TO SEE SERVICE YOU HAVE A LOT OF

02:20:25.049 --> 02:20:26.851
REAL ESTATE. AND COMPLEXITY WITH

02:20:26.918 --> 02:20:29.053
THE STRUCTURES BEAMS AND CROSS

02:20:29.120 --> 02:20:31.089
BEAMS THAT ATTRACT MARINE LIFE

02:20:31.156 --> 02:20:31.890
THESE PLATFORMS HAVE BEEN

02:20:31.956 --> 02:20:33.591
STUDIED HERE IN CALIFORNIA FOR

02:20:33.658 --> 02:20:35.460
OVER THIRTY YEARS AND HAVE BEEN

02:20:35.527 --> 02:20:37.529
FOUND TO BE AT SOME OF THE MOST

02:20:37.595 --> 02:20:39.397
PRODUCTIVE MARINE HABITATS ON

02:20:39.464 --> 02:20:44.536
THE PLANET. NEXT SLIDE. BUT

02:20:44.602 --> 02:20:46.271
CALIFORNIA IS NOT THE ONLY PLACE

02:20:46.337 --> 02:20:47.972
WHERE THEY'RE OFF THROWINGGAS

02:20:48.039 --> 02:20:50.708
PLATFORMS NEXT SLIDE. AND SO I'D

02:20:50.775 --> 02:20:54.546
LIKE TO SHOW A QUICK. VIDEO OF

02:20:54.612 --> 02:20:56.581
RICK'S REEF PROGRAMS AROUND THE

02:20:56.648 --> 02:20:59.484
WORLD HERE SEE A MAP OF THE

02:20:59.551 --> 02:21:01.820
GLOBE IN THE RED AND- THE RED

02:21:01.886 --> 02:21:02.487
AND BLUE REPRESENTS OIL AND GAS

02:21:02.554 --> 02:21:04.956
FIELDS. AS YOU CAN SEE THE

02:21:05.023 --> 02:21:06.724
FIELDS ARE HIGHLY CONCENTRATED

02:21:06.791 --> 02:21:07.559
ALONG THE SHORELINE AND

02:21:07.625 --> 02:21:10.428
OFFSHORE. IN FACT IN EVERY OCEAN

02:21:10.495 --> 02:21:13.031
UP WE ARE EXTRACTING OIL AND GAS

02:21:13.097 --> 02:21:15.300
RESERVES. SO WITH THIS

02:21:15.366 --> 02:21:16.434
INTERNATIONAL REACH YOU WOULD

02:21:16.501 --> 02:21:18.203
THINK THAT DECOMMISSIONING

02:21:18.269 --> 02:21:19.671
ALTERNATIVES ARE DECOMMISSIONING

02:21:19.737 --> 02:21:21.239
DISCUSSIONS WOULD BE DISCUSSED

02:21:21.306 --> 02:21:23.007
ON AN INTERNATIONAL STAGE BUT

02:21:23.074 --> 02:21:25.210
THIS IS NOT THE CASE THERE ONLY

02:21:25.276 --> 02:21:27.212
A FEW PLACES THAT HAVE. RICK'S

02:21:27.278 --> 02:21:28.713
REEF ALTERNATIVE SOMEONE TAKE A

02:21:28.780 --> 02:21:30.548
CLOSER LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE

02:21:30.615 --> 02:21:31.649
PROGRAMS THAT ARE WELL

02:21:31.716 --> 02:21:34.352
ESTABLISHED AS WELL AS THOSE

02:21:34.419 --> 02:21:35.587
THOSE THAT ARE JUST BEGINNING TO

02:21:35.653 --> 02:21:37.155
DEVELOP. FIRST WE'LL TAKE A LOOK

02:21:37.222 --> 02:21:39.390
AT CALIFORNIA WHERE BACK IN TWO

02:21:39.457 --> 02:21:40.358
THOUSAND TEN FORMER GOVERNOR

02:21:40.425 --> 02:21:42.694
SCHWARZENEGGER SIGNED IN AB

02:21:42.760 --> 02:21:44.596
TWENTY FIVE OH THREE. THE MARINE

02:21:44.662 --> 02:21:45.263
RESOURCE LEGACY ACT WHICH

02:21:45.330 --> 02:21:47.866
PERMITS- DECOMMISSIONING OF OUR

02:21:47.932 --> 02:21:50.335
PLATFORMS AS POTENTIAL REEFS.

02:21:50.401 --> 02:21:52.704
HOWEVER DUE TO SOME OF THE

02:21:52.770 --> 02:21:54.138
LEGISLATIVE ISSUES WITHIN THE

02:21:54.205 --> 02:21:56.040
LAW IT DOESN'T INCENTIVIZE THE

02:21:56.107 --> 02:21:57.709
OIL COMPANIES FOR THE STATE TO

02:21:57.775 --> 02:21:59.310
REALLY PARTICIPATE MANY OF THESE

02:21:59.377 --> 02:22:01.212
ISSUES ARE WITH THE LIABILITY

02:22:01.279 --> 02:22:03.715
ASSOCIATED WITH THE POP FROM

02:22:03.781 --> 02:22:04.949
JACKET ITSELF. SO SINCE ITS

02:22:05.016 --> 02:22:08.753
SIGNING IN TWO THOUSAND TEN NONE

02:22:08.820 --> 02:22:09.320
OF OUR PLATFORMS HAVE BEEN

02:22:09.387 --> 02:22:10.955
BRIEFED. NOW THIS STANDS IN

02:22:11.022 --> 02:22:12.891
STARK CONTRAST TO THE GULF OF

02:22:12.957 --> 02:22:13.458
MEXICO WHERE THE STATES OF.

02:22:13.524 --> 02:22:14.626
LOUISIANA AND TEXAS HAVE BEEN

02:22:14.692 --> 02:22:16.628
REAPING THEIR PLATFORMS FOR OVER

02:22:16.694 --> 02:22:17.528
THIRTY YEARS THEY HAVE SOMEWHERE

02:22:17.595 --> 02:22:20.031
BETWEEN. FIVE HUNDRED AND SIX

02:22:20.098 --> 02:22:21.466
HUNDRED PLATFORMS THAT ARE

02:22:21.532 --> 02:22:22.267
CURRENTLY FUNCTIONING AS

02:22:22.333 --> 02:22:25.470
SUCCESSFUL ARTIFICIAL REEFS AND

02:22:25.536 --> 02:22:28.106
MANAGED BY THE STATE'S THEIR- IN

02:22:28.172 --> 02:22:29.173
THE STATE'S DEPARTMENT OF FISH

02:22:29.240 --> 02:22:31.876
AND WILDLIFE. NOW WILL HEAD OVER

02:22:31.943 --> 02:22:32.477
TO SOUTHEAST ASIA AND TAKE A

02:22:32.543 --> 02:22:34.312
LOOK AT PER NIGHT WHICH HAS

02:22:34.379 --> 02:22:36.281
REPURPOSE A STRUCTURE FOR ECO

02:22:36.347 --> 02:22:38.883
TOURISM THEY RETROFITTED THE TOP

02:22:38.950 --> 02:22:40.018
SIDE SO THAT GUESTS COULD COME

02:22:40.084 --> 02:22:42.086
AND STAY THERE AND THEN DIVE IN

02:22:42.153 --> 02:22:43.321
THE PLOT FROM JACK IN THE

02:22:43.388 --> 02:22:44.289
SURROUNDING REEF THIS IS A

02:22:44.355 --> 02:22:46.724
POTENTIAL RE PURPOSING IDEA THAT

02:22:46.791 --> 02:22:48.726
HAS WORKED TO GENERATE. MONEY

02:22:48.793 --> 02:22:51.262
FOR THE LOCAL ECONOMY HERE OFF

02:22:51.329 --> 02:22:54.399
THE COAST OF FOR NINE. OTHER

02:22:54.465 --> 02:22:56.301
AREAS IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA

02:22:56.367 --> 02:22:58.770
INCLUDING THE GULF OF THAILAND

02:22:58.836 --> 02:23:01.205
HAVE BEGUN TO DEVELOP. THEIR OWN

02:23:01.272 --> 02:23:02.874
RIGS TO REEF PROGRAMS OVER THE

02:23:02.941 --> 02:23:05.610
PAST TEN YEARS THEY'VE BEEN

02:23:05.677 --> 02:23:07.645
RESEARCHING. HOW TO. MAKE A

02:23:07.712 --> 02:23:09.347
SUCCESSFUL ROOFING PROGRAM WHICH

02:23:09.414 --> 02:23:11.115
INCLUDED DISCUSSING THESE

02:23:11.182 --> 02:23:12.717
PROGRAMS WITH MULTIPLE

02:23:12.784 --> 02:23:14.218
STAKEHOLDERS FISHING

02:23:14.285 --> 02:23:15.386
STAKEHOLDERS REGULATORY

02:23:15.453 --> 02:23:17.388
STAKEHOLDERS AND- THE GULF OF

02:23:17.455 --> 02:23:18.690
THAILAND HAS JUST PASSED THEIR

02:23:18.756 --> 02:23:22.360
FIRST. RETHINK CANDIDATE. OUR

02:23:22.427 --> 02:23:24.262
LAST STOP WILL BE OFF THE COAST

02:23:24.329 --> 02:23:26.164
OF AFRICA IN THE BONE WHERE DR

02:23:26.230 --> 02:23:27.198
NICK SALA AND NATIONAL

02:23:27.265 --> 02:23:28.499
GEOGRAPHIC EXPLORER WENT AND

02:23:28.566 --> 02:23:30.168
BUILT ON THESE PLATFORMS WHAT WE

02:23:30.234 --> 02:23:32.236
FOUND IS THAT WHILE TRAWLING HAD

02:23:32.303 --> 02:23:33.071
DECIMATING THE FISHING

02:23:33.137 --> 02:23:34.305
POPULATIONS IN THE SURROUNDING

02:23:34.372 --> 02:23:36.507
AREA. THESE PLATFORMS WERE HOT

02:23:36.574 --> 02:23:38.276
SPOTS FOR LIFE AND HIS RESEARCH

02:23:38.343 --> 02:23:41.079
GOT THESE PLATFORMS INCORPORATED

02:23:41.145 --> 02:23:42.814
INTO AFRICA'S LARGEST MARINE

02:23:42.880 --> 02:23:48.086
PARK. NEXT SLIDE. NOW I WANT TO

02:23:48.152 --> 02:23:50.688
DO A QUICK OVERVIEW OF SOME OF

02:23:50.755 --> 02:23:51.856
THE PROS AND CONS OF THIS

02:23:51.923 --> 02:23:56.260
PROGRAM NEXT SLIDE. NEXT SLIDE.

02:23:56.327 --> 02:23:59.297
FIRST CON WE SEE. AS A LACK OF

02:23:59.364 --> 02:24:01.966
GLOBAL LEGISLATION FOR A WHILE.

02:24:02.033 --> 02:24:03.201
EVERY STREET PROGRAM IN THE GULF

02:24:03.267 --> 02:24:04.969
OF MEXICO MIGHT BE SUCCESSFUL

02:24:05.036 --> 02:24:06.804
FOR THE STATE OF TEXAS AND

02:24:06.871 --> 02:24:08.406
LOUISIANA WE NEED TO LOOK AT HOW

02:24:08.473 --> 02:24:09.674
THE PROGRAM WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL

02:24:09.741 --> 02:24:11.109
IN CALIFORNIA AND REALLY.

02:24:11.175 --> 02:24:12.677
ADDRESS OUR STAKEHOLDER NEEDS

02:24:12.744 --> 02:24:14.579
AND PREFERENCES TO HAVE A

02:24:14.645 --> 02:24:19.884
SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM. NEXT SLIDE.

02:24:19.951 --> 02:24:21.586
INVASIVE SPECIES IS ANOTHER

02:24:21.652 --> 02:24:23.955
CONCERN THIS PHOTO WAS TAKEN. ON

02:24:24.022 --> 02:24:25.323
A DIVE ON THE PLOT FROM THE GULF

02:24:25.390 --> 02:24:27.091
OF MEXICO THAT'S A LINE FISH

02:24:27.158 --> 02:24:29.394
WHICH IS INVASIVE. THERE HAVE

02:24:29.460 --> 02:24:30.495
BEEN FOUND TO BE INVASIVE

02:24:30.561 --> 02:24:31.863
SPECIES ON CALIFORNIA'S

02:24:31.929 --> 02:24:33.531
PLATFORMS AND THEY'VE DONE SOME

02:24:33.598 --> 02:24:35.366
RESEARCH ON THIS IN THE GULF OF

02:24:35.433 --> 02:24:37.135
MEXICO AND THEY FOUND THAT

02:24:37.201 --> 02:24:38.102
WHILE. THE PLATFORMS WERE ACTING

02:24:38.169 --> 02:24:40.104
AS A STEPPING STONE FOR THE

02:24:40.171 --> 02:24:41.773
SPREAD OF INVASIVE SPECIES THEY

02:24:41.839 --> 02:24:43.441
WEREN'T SPREADING AT A RATE ANY

02:24:43.508 --> 02:24:45.743
GREATER THAN THE NATURAL NEARBY

02:24:45.810 --> 02:24:49.914
BRIEFS. NEXT SLIDE. ANOTHER CON

02:24:49.981 --> 02:24:51.382
WE SEE AS A LACK OF PUBLIC

02:24:51.449 --> 02:24:52.483
UNDERSTANDING FOR WHEN MOST

02:24:52.550 --> 02:24:54.619
PEOPLE SEE OFFER PLATFORMS

02:24:54.685 --> 02:24:56.187
UNLESS YOU'RE A DIVER FISHERMAN

02:24:56.254 --> 02:24:57.955
YOU. LIKELY HAVE NO IDEA THAT

02:24:58.022 --> 02:24:59.624
THERE COULD BE A MARINE

02:24:59.690 --> 02:25:00.892
ECOSYSTEM BENEATH THE SURFACE.

02:25:00.958 --> 02:25:02.193
THIS IS WHERE A LOT OF OUR WORK

02:25:02.260 --> 02:25:03.828
IS REALLY FOCUSED ON

02:25:03.895 --> 02:25:05.163
DISSEMINATING THE SCIENCE AND

02:25:05.229 --> 02:25:06.964
COMMUNICATING TO THE PUBLIC THE

02:25:07.031 --> 02:25:09.100
VALUE OF THE STRUCTURES. AS

02:25:09.167 --> 02:25:11.769
ARTIFICIAL REEFS. AND THIS ALSO

02:25:11.836 --> 02:25:14.205
WILL HELP THEM TO MAKE. INFORMED

02:25:14.272 --> 02:25:15.807
DECISIONS REGARDING THE FUTURE

02:25:15.873 --> 02:25:17.742
OF THEIR OCEAN RESOURCES NEXT

02:25:17.809 --> 02:25:23.014
SLIDE. ANOTHER CON WE SEE IS IF

02:25:23.081 --> 02:25:24.515
THE STRUCTURES ARE PERMANENTLY

02:25:24.582 --> 02:25:27.285
INSTALLED AS RE STABLE BE. AN

02:25:27.351 --> 02:25:29.554
OBSTRUCTION ON THE SEA FLOOR TO

02:25:29.620 --> 02:25:32.690
LIMIT OTHER. OCEAN USERS FROM

02:25:32.757 --> 02:25:34.625
ACCESSING THAT SPACE ONE

02:25:34.692 --> 02:25:36.461
POTENTIAL CONFLICT COULD ARISE

02:25:36.527 --> 02:25:38.296
WITH TROLL FISHERMEN WHO.

02:25:38.362 --> 02:25:39.831
TROLLING IS LIKE TAKING A

02:25:39.897 --> 02:25:41.833
GIGANTIC NOT THE SIZE OF A

02:25:41.899 --> 02:25:44.802
FOOTBALL FIELD AND RUNNING ALONG

02:25:44.869 --> 02:25:45.803
THE SEA FLOOR MALIK MAY HAVE

02:25:45.870 --> 02:25:47.305
SOME DESTRUCTIVE COMPONENT TO IT

02:25:47.371 --> 02:25:49.207
IT IS A VIABLE FISHING INDUSTRY

02:25:49.273 --> 02:25:51.509
AND WITH THESE PLATFORMS IN THE

02:25:51.576 --> 02:25:53.978
WAY IT THEIR INSTRUCTION TO THAT

02:25:54.045 --> 02:25:58.516
PARTICULAR FISHERY. NEXT SLIDE.

02:25:58.583 --> 02:26:00.184
NOW TAKE A QUICK LOOK AT SOME OF

02:26:00.251 --> 02:26:02.286
THE PROS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR

02:26:02.353 --> 02:26:03.154
THE STRUCTURES TO ENHANCE OUR

02:26:03.221 --> 02:26:05.056
LOCAL FISHERIES NEXT SLIDE

02:26:05.123 --> 02:26:09.994
ESPECIALLY AS OUR- NEXT SLIDE.

02:26:10.061 --> 02:26:11.896
ESPECIALLY AS OUR NEARSHORE

02:26:11.963 --> 02:26:14.398
HABITATS ARE DEGRADED BY. RUNOFF

02:26:14.465 --> 02:26:15.967
POLLUTION OVERFISHING WHAT WE'RE

02:26:16.033 --> 02:26:17.502
FINDING IS THAT MANY SPECIES ARE

02:26:17.568 --> 02:26:19.070
MOVING OFF SHORE AND MAKING

02:26:19.137 --> 02:26:20.671
THEIR PERMANENT HOME ON THESE

02:26:20.738 --> 02:26:24.408
PLATFORMS NEXT SLIDE. ANOTHER

02:26:24.475 --> 02:26:25.877
PRO WE SEE IS THE ECONOMIC

02:26:25.943 --> 02:26:27.612
BENEFITS IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED

02:26:27.678 --> 02:26:28.513
HERE TODAY THAT THERE ARE

02:26:28.579 --> 02:26:30.248
SIGNIFICANT COSTS ASSOCIATED

02:26:30.314 --> 02:26:31.916
WITH DECOMMISSIONING. IF A

02:26:31.983 --> 02:26:34.452
STRUCTURE IS REACHED THERE WILL

02:26:34.519 --> 02:26:37.054
BE A SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS

02:26:37.121 --> 02:26:40.825
AND- ACCORDING TO AB TWENTY FIVE

02:26:40.892 --> 02:26:41.993
OH THREE A PORTION OF THAT

02:26:42.059 --> 02:26:43.261
SAVINGS WOULD GO BACK TO THE

02:26:43.327 --> 02:26:44.996
STATE INTO AN ENDOWMENT FOR

02:26:45.062 --> 02:26:45.930
MARINE PRESERVATION AND

02:26:45.997 --> 02:26:50.501
CONSERVATION NEXT SLIDE. IN FACT

02:26:50.568 --> 02:26:52.937
IF TWENTY THREE OF CALIFORNIA'S

02:26:53.004 --> 02:26:54.238
TWENTY SEVEN PLATFORMS WERE

02:26:54.305 --> 02:26:55.339
REMOVED THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:26:55.406 --> 02:26:58.376
WOULD GET 600-528-0050 MILLION.

02:26:58.442 --> 02:27:00.077
AS PART OF A TOTAL ONE BILLION

02:27:00.144 --> 02:27:07.718
AND SAVE COSTS. EXCITED. WE HAVE

02:27:07.785 --> 02:27:09.754
RESOURCES AVAILABLE AT BLUE

02:27:09.820 --> 02:27:11.289

REACH OUT TO ME- VIA VIA MY

02:27:15.893 --> 02:27:17.662
EMAIL AND I LOOK FORWARD TO

02:27:17.728 --> 02:27:19.564
HAVING COLLABORATIVE DISCUSSIONS

02:27:19.630 --> 02:27:21.165
WITH YOU ALL ABOUT THIS

02:27:21.232 --> 02:27:24.936
IMPORTANT CONSERVATION ISSUE.

02:27:25.002 --> 02:27:27.939
THANK YOU AT QUESTIONS. I HAVE I

02:27:28.005 --> 02:27:29.640
HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS TO

02:27:29.707 --> 02:27:33.511
AND WE EVER HEARD THAT THE REEFS

02:27:33.578 --> 02:27:35.213
THAT'S RIGHT THE RAGS OF

02:27:35.279 --> 02:27:37.215
CALIFORNIA'S COAST ARE IN WATER

02:27:37.281 --> 02:27:39.784
I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW FROM

02:27:39.850 --> 02:27:40.785
THIRTY EIGHT FEET TO TWELVE

02:27:40.851 --> 02:27:43.321
HUNDRED FEET DEEP- SUIT WHAT ARE

02:27:43.387 --> 02:27:46.357
THE CRITERIA THAT MAKE A RAKE

02:27:46.424 --> 02:27:49.760
SUITABLE FOR YOU KNOW EVEN

02:27:49.827 --> 02:27:50.795
CONSIDERING THIS THIS KIND OF

02:27:50.861 --> 02:27:51.395
THING. ARE THERE CERTAIN DEPTH

02:27:51.462 --> 02:27:53.698
REQUIREMENTS- ARE THERE ANY

02:27:53.764 --> 02:27:56.701
LIMITATIONS TO WHAT KIND OF A

02:27:56.767 --> 02:27:57.702
RIG COULD ACTUALLY BE

02:27:57.768 --> 02:27:59.103
APPROPRIATE FOR ROOFING

02:27:59.170 --> 02:28:01.138
ABSOLUTELY SO. EVERY PLATFORM

02:28:01.205 --> 02:28:04.075
NEEDS TO BE AT. LOOKED AT ON A

02:28:04.141 --> 02:28:06.010
CASE BY CASE BASIS AND WATER

02:28:06.077 --> 02:28:07.945
DEPTH PLAYS. PLAYS IN

02:28:08.012 --> 02:28:09.680
SIGNIFICANTLY HERE ESPECIALLY IF

02:28:09.747 --> 02:28:13.684
WE NEED TO- IT HERE TO THE U. S.

02:28:13.751 --> 02:28:14.919
COAST CARDS REGULATION OF HAVING

02:28:14.986 --> 02:28:17.255
AT CUT OFF DEPTH OF EIGHTY FIVE

02:28:17.321 --> 02:28:18.956
FEET. OBVIOUSLY THE PLATFORMS IN

02:28:19.023 --> 02:28:21.425
SHALLOWER WATERS ARE NOT GOING

02:28:21.492 --> 02:28:22.994
TO BE. A GREAT CANDIDATE

02:28:23.060 --> 02:28:25.363
COMPLEXITY IS ANOTHER. MAJOR

02:28:25.429 --> 02:28:27.131
COMPONENT A STRUCTURE THAT IS

02:28:27.198 --> 02:28:29.367
MORE COMPLEX WILL LIKELY HAVE

02:28:29.433 --> 02:28:31.202
MORE NOOKS AND CRANNIES AREAS

02:28:31.269 --> 02:28:33.404
FOR MARINE LIFE THAT TO DEVELOP.

02:28:33.471 --> 02:28:34.972
AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER CRITICAL

02:28:35.039 --> 02:28:38.042
COMPONENT THAT WE NEED TO LOOK

02:28:38.109 --> 02:28:41.245
AT- IN CALIFORNIA SOME OF OUR

02:28:41.312 --> 02:28:43.648
PLATFORMS HAVE BURNED STALLED

02:28:43.714 --> 02:28:45.149
DECADES AGO AND SO THEIR

02:28:45.216 --> 02:28:46.951
TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS AS WELL

02:28:47.018 --> 02:28:49.153
IN TERMS OF HOW WE CAN FEASIBLY

02:28:49.220 --> 02:28:51.255
REMOVE THAT STRUCTURE AND WHERE

02:28:51.322 --> 02:28:53.224
ARE WE GOING TO BRING IT ON

02:28:53.291 --> 02:28:54.925
SHORE OR DISMANTLE IT IN ANOTHER

02:28:54.992 --> 02:28:57.328
AREA SO THOSE ARE ALL

02:28:57.395 --> 02:28:58.396
CONSIDERATIONS THAT WE NEED TO

02:28:58.462 --> 02:29:02.133
LOOK AT. AND SO THAT THE- TWENTY

02:29:02.199 --> 02:29:04.268
SEVEN PLATFORMS- IN IN

02:29:04.335 --> 02:29:06.537
CALIFORNIA WATERS. DO YOU HAVE

02:29:06.604 --> 02:29:08.639
AN ASSESSMENT ON AROUND HIM HOW

02:29:08.706 --> 02:29:10.975
MANY OF THOSE MIGHT BE SUITABLE

02:29:11.042 --> 02:29:13.644
FOR ROOFING. WE HAVE NOT DONE AN

02:29:13.711 --> 02:29:15.279
ASSESSMENT ON HOW MANY WOULD BE

02:29:15.346 --> 02:29:17.748
A SUITABLE FOR ROOFING BUT THERE

02:29:17.815 --> 02:29:19.817
ARE MANY THAT WOULD BE

02:29:19.884 --> 02:29:22.219
APPLICABLE CANDIDATES. YES I

02:29:22.286 --> 02:29:24.221
KNOW THAT THERE ARE TWENTY THREE

02:29:24.288 --> 02:29:26.991
AND FEDERAL WATERS AND AS YOU GO

02:29:27.058 --> 02:29:28.993
FURTHER OFF SHORE IT YOU GAIN

02:29:29.060 --> 02:29:30.261
GREATER AND GREATER DEATH

02:29:30.328 --> 02:29:32.463
WRITTEN SO THOSE COULD BE

02:29:32.530 --> 02:29:34.231
POTENTIALLY. GOOD CANDIDATES.

02:29:34.298 --> 02:29:36.167
AND I THINK WE HAVE I'M MISS

02:29:36.233 --> 02:29:39.870
CRAP. ON FOR THIS PANEL AS WELL

02:29:39.937 --> 02:29:41.472
. I KNOW YOU MENTIONED SOME OF

02:29:41.539 --> 02:29:42.907
THIS IN YOUR PRESENTATION AS

02:29:42.973 --> 02:29:46.177
WELL I DO YOU HAVE A PET HAVE

02:29:46.243 --> 02:29:48.279
YOU OR YOUR ORGANISATION DONE AN

02:29:48.346 --> 02:29:50.214
ASSESSMENT AROUND. I DON'T WHAT

02:29:50.281 --> 02:29:52.116
PLATFORMS IN FEDERAL AT SORRY IN

02:29:52.183 --> 02:29:55.386
CALIFORNIA WATERS WOULD

02:29:55.453 --> 02:29:58.522
POTENTIALLY BE SUITABLE. THANK

02:29:58.589 --> 02:30:01.292
YOU VERY MUCH- WHAT WE HAVE TO

02:30:01.359 --> 02:30:04.128
LOOK AT IS- THE CRITERIA THAT

02:30:04.195 --> 02:30:05.496
ARE ESTABLISHED IN THE STATE

02:30:05.563 --> 02:30:07.698
LAW- SO THESE HAVEN'T BEEN

02:30:07.765 --> 02:30:09.467
APPLIED YET BUT THE CRITERIA

02:30:09.533 --> 02:30:11.635
REQUIRE- THE STATE TO CONSIDER

02:30:11.702 --> 02:30:13.604
THE DEPTH OF THE PLATFORM THE

02:30:13.671 --> 02:30:15.673
LOCATION OF THE PLATFORM AND

02:30:15.740 --> 02:30:18.209
PROXIMITY TO OTHER REEFS- TO

02:30:18.275 --> 02:30:20.811
LOOK AT POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO

02:30:20.878 --> 02:30:22.613
BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES AND WATER

02:30:22.680 --> 02:30:24.849
QUALITY FOR FULL REMOVAL VERSUS

02:30:24.915 --> 02:30:27.151
PARTIAL REMOVAL. LOOK AT

02:30:27.218 --> 02:30:28.586
POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO THE

02:30:28.652 --> 02:30:29.453
ENVIRONMENT A FULL VERSUS

02:30:29.520 --> 02:30:31.689
PARTIAL REMOVAL- LOOK AT THE

02:30:31.756 --> 02:30:34.625
CONTRIBUTION TO PRODUCTIVITY OF

02:30:34.692 --> 02:30:36.861
FICTION WRITING LIFE AND FINALLY

02:30:36.927 --> 02:30:38.329
TO LOOK AT POTENTIAL MANAGEMENT

02:30:38.396 --> 02:30:40.131
RESTRICTIONS SUCH AS DEALING

02:30:40.197 --> 02:30:43.167
WITH FISHING- ON THE STRUCTURES

02:30:43.234 --> 02:30:45.102
SO AFTER ALL THAT ANALYSIS IS

02:30:45.169 --> 02:30:46.937
DONE THE STATE IS REQUIRED ON

02:30:47.004 --> 02:30:48.372
THE PLATFORM BY PLATFORM BASIS

02:30:48.439 --> 02:30:50.074
TO DETERMINE WHICH OPTION

02:30:50.141 --> 02:30:52.543
PROVIDES THE NET BENEFIT TO THE

02:30:52.610 --> 02:30:55.079
RATE ENVIRONMENT- I AGREE WITH

02:30:55.146 --> 02:30:57.448
DESPITE THAT- THE SHOWER

02:30:57.515 --> 02:30:58.749
PLATFORM PROBABLY DON'T EVEN

02:30:58.816 --> 02:31:00.117
QUALIFY BECAUSE OF THE

02:31:00.184 --> 02:31:03.354
NAVIGATIONAL REQUIREMENTS BUT- I

02:31:03.421 --> 02:31:05.523
THINK THE TAKEAWAY HERE IS THAT

02:31:05.589 --> 02:31:07.658
WE'RE EMBARKING ON THAT PROCESS-

02:31:07.725 --> 02:31:09.160
HOLLY WILL BE THE FIRST PLATFORM

02:31:09.226 --> 02:31:11.562
BUT THERE'S- EIGHT. IN THE QUEUE

02:31:11.629 --> 02:31:13.130
NOW WE THINK THAT NUMBER WILL

02:31:13.197 --> 02:31:14.965
INCREASE PRETTY DRAMATICALLY

02:31:15.032 --> 02:31:16.400
GIVEN THAT MOST OF THE PLATFORMS

02:31:16.467 --> 02:31:17.902
OFFER CALIFORNIA ARE NOT

02:31:17.968 --> 02:31:25.509
PRODUCING VERY MUCH- AND- ARMIES

02:31:25.576 --> 02:31:27.545
OF SCALE WILL MAKE THE- MORE

02:31:27.611 --> 02:31:29.747
FOR- ONE. THE COMPANIES COULD-

02:31:29.814 --> 02:31:31.415
JOINT. INSURANCE OF THE CALL

02:31:31.482 --> 02:31:33.384
WORKS ONE THE LARGEST COSTS OF

02:31:33.451 --> 02:31:35.653
DECOMMISSIONING IS BRING IN THE

02:31:35.719 --> 02:31:36.854
RESOLVER FROM THE NORTH SEA-

02:31:36.921 --> 02:31:38.923
THAT'S BEEN IMPEDIMENT. BUT NOW

02:31:38.989 --> 02:31:40.591
THEY CAN SHARE THOSE COSTS AND

02:31:40.658 --> 02:31:42.026
SO WE THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE

02:31:42.092 --> 02:31:44.128
THAT NUMBER GO UP WE'RE GONNA

02:31:44.195 --> 02:31:45.796
YOU HAVE THESE ANALYSES I'M AS

02:31:45.863 --> 02:31:47.631
WELL AS THE ENVIRONMENT REVIEW

02:31:47.698 --> 02:31:49.767
SO I THINK WE'RE ON OUR WAY- AND

02:31:49.834 --> 02:31:51.669
THEN WE'LL- FIND OUT WHICH

02:31:51.735 --> 02:31:54.171
PLATFORMS. ARE APPROPRIATE- TO

02:31:54.238 --> 02:31:58.976
BE- PARTIALLY REMOVED AND WHICH

02:31:59.043 --> 02:32:00.077
ARE MORE APPROPRIATE TO BE FULLY

02:32:00.144 --> 02:32:02.813
REMOVED. AND I SUIT THE EX

02:32:02.880 --> 02:32:04.482
MARINE CALIFORNIA'S MARINE

02:32:04.548 --> 02:32:07.084
RESOURCES LEGACY ACT- WE SPACE

02:32:07.151 --> 02:32:08.519
PASSED IN TWENTY TEN IN AT LEAST

02:32:08.586 --> 02:32:10.154
IN CONCEPT ESTABLISHED TO RIGS

02:32:10.221 --> 02:32:11.889
TO REEF. FRAMEWORK FOR

02:32:11.956 --> 02:32:13.524
CALIFORNIA- IS YOU BOTH

02:32:13.591 --> 02:32:16.160
MENTIONED IN YOUR REMARKS THAT.

02:32:16.227 --> 02:32:17.862
HAS NOT RESULTED IN ANY. OF

02:32:17.928 --> 02:32:19.430
THESE PLATFORMS ACTUALLY BEING

02:32:19.497 --> 02:32:21.532
RECEIVED I'M REALLY INTERESTED

02:32:21.599 --> 02:32:23.133
IN BOTH OF YOUR PERSPECTIVES-

02:32:23.200 --> 02:32:26.337
ROUND OUT WHY THAT'S THAT HAS

02:32:26.403 --> 02:32:29.306
BEEN THE CASE. AND IF THERE ARE

02:32:29.373 --> 02:32:32.276
APPROPRIATE- MODIFICATIONS TO

02:32:32.343 --> 02:32:34.378
THAT OR IF THERE ARE MARK

02:32:34.445 --> 02:32:36.881
MODIFICATIONS TO THAT FACT THAT

02:32:36.947 --> 02:32:43.287
YOU BELIEVE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE. WELL I CAN YEAH I THINK THAT.

02:32:43.354 --> 02:32:45.022
IS AREALLY SIMPLE ANSWER WHICH

02:32:45.089 --> 02:32:48.492
AT JUNE GENERAL CASEY MENTION.

02:32:48.559 --> 02:32:50.794
THE STATE CANNOT FORCE THE

02:32:50.861 --> 02:32:53.230
COMPANY TO DECOMMISSION

02:32:53.297 --> 02:32:55.199
PLATFORM. ONCE THAT LEASES

02:32:55.266 --> 02:32:58.235
ISSUED AND PRODUCTION AND SUSE

02:32:58.302 --> 02:32:59.737
THE COMPANY CONTINUED TO

02:32:59.803 --> 02:33:01.005
PRODUCING AS LONG AS THEY WANT

02:33:01.071 --> 02:33:05.509
WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IS-

02:33:05.576 --> 02:33:07.578
LOBBYIST. EVERITT STALLED WHAT

02:33:07.645 --> 02:33:10.581
YOU DON'T SIXTIES YEARS AGO ARE

02:33:10.648 --> 02:33:12.850
WRAPPING UP THEIR- VIABLE

02:33:12.917 --> 02:33:14.952
PRODUCTIVE LIFE AND SO WE ARE

02:33:15.019 --> 02:33:16.687
STARTING TO SEE POPCORN SNAPPING

02:33:16.754 --> 02:33:18.722
DECOMMISSION WE HAVE EIGHT IN

02:33:18.789 --> 02:33:20.324
THE Q. AND AS I MENTIONED I

02:33:20.391 --> 02:33:21.325
COULD SEE THAT DOUBLE IN THE

02:33:21.392 --> 02:33:24.028
NEXT FEW YEARS- SO IT'S NOT TOO

02:33:24.094 --> 02:33:26.196
MANY PEOPLE OF THE LAW IT'S BEEN

02:33:26.263 --> 02:33:29.266
A ECONOMIC- DETERMINATION BY

02:33:29.333 --> 02:33:31.502
THESE- PLATFORM OPERATORS AND

02:33:31.569 --> 02:33:33.070
OWNERS. THEY ARE THIRTIES

02:33:33.137 --> 02:33:36.340
DECOMMISSIONED- SO NOW LET'S LET

02:33:36.407 --> 02:33:40.144
THE LAW WORK. YES THANK YOU

02:33:40.210 --> 02:33:42.746
LINDA JUST TIME ADD ON TO THE I

02:33:42.813 --> 02:33:44.915
WOULD SAY THAT. SOME OF THE

02:33:44.982 --> 02:33:48.352
ISSUES WITH THE LAW OUR-

02:33:48.419 --> 02:33:50.254
PRIMARILY WITH THE LIABILITY FOR

02:33:50.321 --> 02:33:52.423
THE STRUCTURE ITSELF WHILE THE

02:33:52.489 --> 02:33:54.758
WELLS RICH REMAIN WITH THE OIL

02:33:54.825 --> 02:33:56.026
COMPANIES SO SHOULD THERE EVER

02:33:56.093 --> 02:33:57.361
BE A LEAK OR SPILL THEY'LL

02:33:57.428 --> 02:33:59.196
ALWAYS BE RESPONSIBLE THE

02:33:59.263 --> 02:34:00.364
LIABILITY FOR THAT PLATFORM

02:34:00.431 --> 02:34:02.866
JACKET IT'S NOT CLEARLY STATED

02:34:02.933 --> 02:34:04.501
IN AB TWENTY FIVE OH THREE WHO

02:34:04.568 --> 02:34:07.938
WOULD. TAKE THAT ON AND SO. IT

02:34:08.005 --> 02:34:09.239
WOULD DEFAULT TO THE OIL

02:34:09.306 --> 02:34:10.741
COMPANIES TO RETAIN THAT

02:34:10.808 --> 02:34:12.576
LIABILITY BUT THE OIL COMPANIES

02:34:12.643 --> 02:34:14.345
ARE NOT INTERESTED AND HOLDING

02:34:14.411 --> 02:34:16.347
ON TO THE STRUCTURE. MULTIPLE

02:34:16.413 --> 02:34:17.848
YEARS DOWN THE LINE AS IT'S

02:34:17.915 --> 02:34:19.183
FUNCTIONING AS AN ARTIFICIAL

02:34:19.249 --> 02:34:21.986
REEF AND SO IN THE GULF OF

02:34:22.052 --> 02:34:24.021
MEXICO WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS.

02:34:24.088 --> 02:34:26.657
THEY HAVE DEVELOPED DEPARTMENT

02:34:26.724 --> 02:34:28.592
OF FISH AND WILDLIFE ARTIFICIAL

02:34:28.659 --> 02:34:30.594
REEF AND RIGS TO REEF PROGRAMS

02:34:30.661 --> 02:34:33.063
IN LOUISIANA TEXAS MISSISSIPPI

02:34:33.130 --> 02:34:35.599
AND THOSE PROGRAMS. MANAGE THESE

02:34:35.666 --> 02:34:37.635
STRUCTURES AND TAKE ON THE

02:34:37.701 --> 02:34:39.169
LIABILITY AS THEY MANAGE ALL THE

02:34:39.236 --> 02:34:40.838
OTHER ARTIFICIAL REEFS UNDER

02:34:40.904 --> 02:34:43.607
THEIR JURISDICTION. AND IF WE

02:34:43.674 --> 02:34:45.209
WERE TO LOOK AT THE GULF OF

02:34:45.275 --> 02:34:46.477
MEXICO AS AN EXAMPLE WE COULD

02:34:46.543 --> 02:34:49.179
SAY WE COULD ESTABLISH A RIGS TO

02:34:49.246 --> 02:34:50.447
REEF PROGRAM THROUGH OUR

02:34:50.514 --> 02:34:51.815
DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE

02:34:51.882 --> 02:34:53.951
TO TAKE ON THAT LIABILITY. AND

02:34:54.018 --> 02:34:56.220
THE LEGISLATION WOULD NEED TO

02:34:56.286 --> 02:34:57.488
HAVE SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO

02:34:57.554 --> 02:34:59.256
ACCOMMODATE FOR THAT TRANSFER OF

02:34:59.323 --> 02:35:01.392
LIABILITY AND MAKE IT CLEAR OF

02:35:01.458 --> 02:35:03.293
THAT SPECIFIC PATHWAY AND SO

02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:05.295
THAT COULD BE ONE OPTION THAT

02:35:05.362 --> 02:35:07.731
WOULD POTENTIALLY. MAKE IT AN

02:35:07.798 --> 02:35:09.500
INCENTIVIZE BOTH THE OIL

02:35:09.566 --> 02:35:11.735
COMPANIES AND THE STATE TO

02:35:11.802 --> 02:35:12.936
PARTICIPATE IN THIS LAW AND

02:35:13.003 --> 02:35:14.571
THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL SENATE

02:35:14.638 --> 02:35:18.642
BILLS THAT HAVE. TRIED TO MAKES

02:35:18.709 --> 02:35:19.777
CERTAIN REVISIONS FOR THE LAW TO

02:35:19.843 --> 02:35:21.779
MAKE IT. YOU KNOW MORE.

02:35:21.845 --> 02:35:24.381
ACCEPTABLE BY THIS STAKEHOLDERS

02:35:24.448 --> 02:35:26.450
INVOLVED BUT NONE OF THOSE HAVE

02:35:26.517 --> 02:35:29.987
EFFECTIVELY CHANGE THE LAW. IF I

02:35:30.054 --> 02:35:32.723
MIGHT ADD ON TO THAT- RIGHT AND

02:35:32.790 --> 02:35:33.991
NOW WE'RE RUNNING SHORT ON TIME

02:35:34.058 --> 02:35:35.359
I'D JUST LIKE TO RESPOND REAL

02:35:35.426 --> 02:35:37.361
QUICKLY FIRST OF ALL- THERE HAVE

02:35:37.428 --> 02:35:42.633
BEEN EFFORTS TO CHANGE- AB- FIVE

02:35:42.700 --> 02:35:44.568
OH THREE NONE OF THEM HAVE DEALT

02:35:44.635 --> 02:35:45.202
WITH THE LIABILITY ISSUE THEY'VE

02:35:45.269 --> 02:35:46.937
ALL DEALT WITH TRYING TO WEAKEN.

02:35:47.004 --> 02:35:49.873
THE SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS NUMBER

02:35:49.940 --> 02:35:51.508
TWO AND THE GULF OF MEXICO THEY

02:35:51.575 --> 02:35:53.210
DON'T HAVE ANY NATURAL ROCKY

02:35:53.277 --> 02:35:55.713
WEEK HABITAT SO THEY KIND OF

02:35:55.779 --> 02:35:57.081
VIABLE. ARTIFICIAL REEF PROGRAM

02:35:57.147 --> 02:35:58.782
FOR YEARS AND THE WAY THEY'VE

02:35:58.849 --> 02:36:02.352
ADAPTED TO MAKE ST AS- THEY HAVE

02:36:02.419 --> 02:36:03.921
SET ARTIFICIALLY SITES AT THE

02:36:03.987 --> 02:36:05.989
STATE DOES MANAGE PRIMARILY FOR

02:36:06.056 --> 02:36:07.891
RECREATIONAL FISHING. THEY ALLOW

02:36:07.958 --> 02:36:08.959
CLOUT FROM OPERATORS TO

02:36:09.026 --> 02:36:11.195
CONTRIBUTE SOME MATERIALS TO

02:36:11.261 --> 02:36:12.963
THOSE REVIEW SITES THEY DON'T GO

02:36:13.030 --> 02:36:15.399
AROUND AND MANAGE EVERY SINGLE

02:36:15.466 --> 02:36:17.067
PLATFORM- OPERATOR DOESN'T WANT

02:36:17.134 --> 02:36:18.769
TO REMOVE. THAT WOULD BE

02:36:18.836 --> 02:36:21.772
UNTENABLE SO UP.FOR THE MOST

02:36:21.839 --> 02:36:23.474
PART I KNOW SOMETIMES PLATFORMS

02:36:23.540 --> 02:36:25.242
REMAIN A PLACE BUT FOR THE MOST

02:36:25.309 --> 02:36:26.577
PART THEY ARE REMOVED AND THE

02:36:26.643 --> 02:36:28.145
COMPANIES THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE

02:36:28.212 --> 02:36:31.715
SOME MATERIALS TO. A SET MANAGED

02:36:31.782 --> 02:36:34.218
RECREATIONAL FISHING A REEF SO

02:36:34.284 --> 02:36:35.419
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAT WHAT'S

02:36:35.486 --> 02:36:36.286
BEING PROPOSED HERE IN

02:36:36.353 --> 02:36:38.689
CALIFORNIA AND- I CAN TELL YOU

02:36:38.756 --> 02:36:43.961
I'VE WORKED ON. ALL THE BILL

02:36:44.027 --> 02:36:44.561
SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT.

02:36:44.628 --> 02:36:46.463
ONLY READ AB TWO FIVE OR PASS

02:36:46.530 --> 02:36:47.998
WHAT BECAUSE OF IN DOWN TO.

02:36:48.065 --> 02:36:49.433
PROVISION STATE NOT WANT

02:36:49.500 --> 02:36:50.467
LIABILITY IN PERPETUITY FOR THE

02:36:50.534 --> 02:36:52.369
SITES- IT'S JUST NOT

02:36:52.436 --> 02:36:54.471
ECONOMICALLY STE- RESPONSIBLE

02:36:54.538 --> 02:36:58.976
FOR THE STATE TO DO. WELL THANK

02:36:59.042 --> 02:37:02.312
YOU BOTH I HAD. A QUESTION FROM

02:37:02.379 --> 02:37:04.715
SOMEONE OF THEM- NOT NOT A

02:37:04.782 --> 02:37:06.049
QUESTION REALLY- A COMMENT

02:37:06.116 --> 02:37:07.818
PERHAPS THAT'S A NOTE OF

02:37:07.885 --> 02:37:11.054
CAUTION- I APPRECIATE THE FACT

02:37:11.121 --> 02:37:13.257
THAT TO OTHERS A LOT OF FOUGHT

02:37:13.323 --> 02:37:15.893
THAT'S BEING CUT PUT AN- END TO

02:37:15.959 --> 02:37:19.163
THIS PROGRAM- BUT I HAVE TO PUT

02:37:19.229 --> 02:37:20.931
HIM EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH

02:37:20.998 --> 02:37:23.834
THE ENTIRE TOPIC AND THE REASON-

02:37:23.901 --> 02:37:27.971
IS. FACTUAL AND EMOTIONAL FOR ME

02:37:28.038 --> 02:37:31.275
WE'VE BEEN USING THE OCEANS AS

02:37:31.341 --> 02:37:34.511
OUR GARBAGE CANS WHEN I SAY WE I

02:37:34.578 --> 02:37:36.814
MEAN. THE HUMAN RACE HAS BEEN

02:37:36.880 --> 02:37:39.449
USING THE OCEANS AS OUR GARBAGE

02:37:39.516 --> 02:37:42.119
CANS FOR CENTURIES- YOU KNOW

02:37:42.186 --> 02:37:43.353
WE'VE THROWN EVERYTHING FROM

02:37:43.420 --> 02:37:46.456
PLASTIC BAGS TO- THINGS THAT

02:37:46.523 --> 02:37:49.026
BREAK DOWN INTO MICROPLASTICS TO

02:37:49.092 --> 02:37:51.094
FISHING LINE AND FOLKS SURE I

02:37:51.161 --> 02:37:53.997
MEAN WE FOR YOU FOR YEARS BOTH

02:37:54.064 --> 02:37:57.334
WERE JUST SUNK IN PLACE- SPARE

02:37:57.401 --> 02:38:00.938
TIRE AND NOT SPARE TIRES USED

02:38:01.004 --> 02:38:03.173
TIRES- THAT EVERYTHING UNDER THE

02:38:03.240 --> 02:38:06.076
SUN. IS SITTING ON THE FLOOR OF

02:38:06.143 --> 02:38:08.579
THE OCEAN WHY DO WE NOT PAY THAT

02:38:08.645 --> 02:38:10.314
MUCH ATTENTION TO IT WE DON'T

02:38:10.380 --> 02:38:13.483
SEE IT- BUT IT IT IS POLLUTING

02:38:13.550 --> 02:38:17.287
AND FOLLOWING GOT WATER AROUND

02:38:17.354 --> 02:38:22.125
THE GLOBE. AND. I YOU KNOW I

02:38:22.192 --> 02:38:24.394
RECOGNIZE THAT THESE STRUCTURES

02:38:24.461 --> 02:38:26.029
ARE OUT THERE AND WE HAVE TO

02:38:26.096 --> 02:38:28.532
FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH THEM-

02:38:28.599 --> 02:38:29.466
YOU KNOW NOW THAT THEY'RE OUT

02:38:29.533 --> 02:38:31.401
THERE ALREADY BUT THE UNTANGLING

02:38:31.468 --> 02:38:36.006
OF THIS PROBLEM- IS ONE. THAT I

02:38:36.073 --> 02:38:38.809
THINK WE NEED TO GIVE AN EXTREME

02:38:38.876 --> 02:38:41.712
AMOUNT OF THOUGHT TO- AND NOT

02:38:41.778 --> 02:38:45.282
JUST. CONCEPTUALLY THINK WELL

02:38:45.349 --> 02:38:47.251
YOU KNOW WE GET TO TURN THIS

02:38:47.317 --> 02:38:50.554
INTO A ROOF IT'S LEFT OVER

02:38:50.621 --> 02:38:53.357
GARBAGE THAT WE ARE TRYING TO

02:38:53.423 --> 02:38:55.058
TRANSITION TO SOMETHING THAT'S

02:38:55.125 --> 02:38:57.594
USEFUL BUT IT'S STILL GARBAGE-

02:38:57.661 --> 02:39:00.764
AND WE DON'T THINK ABOUT THIS IN

02:39:00.831 --> 02:39:01.698
THE CONTEXT OF MAYBE THAT THE

02:39:01.765 --> 02:39:03.200
STRUCTURE SHOULD BE THERE IN THE

02:39:03.267 --> 02:39:05.736
FIRST PLACE- THERE'S A CERTAIN

02:39:05.802 --> 02:39:07.537
AMOUNT OF. I'LL BE SELF

02:39:07.604 --> 02:39:09.573
CRITICAL- IN IN MAKING THIS

02:39:09.640 --> 02:39:11.308
STATEMENT I BELIEVE AN OFFSHORE

02:39:11.375 --> 02:39:13.777
WIND YOU KNOW SO THERE'S GOING

02:39:13.844 --> 02:39:15.712
TO HAVE TO BE STRUCTURES FOR

02:39:15.779 --> 02:39:20.450
THAT- I JUST WANT US TO NOT BE

02:39:20.517 --> 02:39:23.720
ONLY THINKING ABOUT. THIS FROM-

02:39:23.787 --> 02:39:27.891
YOU KNOW A SINGULAR PERSPECTIVE-

02:39:27.958 --> 02:39:29.026
WE SHOULD BE THINKING

02:39:29.092 --> 02:39:31.628
HOLISTICALLY ABOUT THIS PROBLEM-

02:39:31.695 --> 02:39:33.530
BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST THE- OF

02:39:33.597 --> 02:39:35.332
THE OIL RIGS THAT ARE OUT THERE

02:39:35.399 --> 02:39:37.467
THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT NEEDS TO

02:39:37.534 --> 02:39:39.403
BE CLEANED UP IN THE OCEAN. YES

02:39:39.469 --> 02:39:41.338
THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THOSE

02:39:41.405 --> 02:39:43.140
COMMENTS I HAVE IF I MAY RESPOND

WHAT YOU'RE WHO. ARE SAYING AND

02:39:46.977 --> 02:39:49.379
I THINK THAT THIS REALLY CALLS

02:39:49.446 --> 02:39:50.414
TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW

02:39:50.480 --> 02:39:52.849
PROCESS THAT IS BEING PRESENTED

02:39:52.916 --> 02:39:54.651
TO US THROUGH THE- THROUGH THE

02:39:54.718 --> 02:39:56.486
EIS AND THROUGH OUR SEQUEL

02:39:56.553 --> 02:39:58.422
PROCESS WE CAN REALLY RELY ON

02:39:58.488 --> 02:40:00.390
THAT AS AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR

02:40:00.457 --> 02:40:02.693
LOOKING AT. USING PORTENT

02:40:02.759 --> 02:40:04.094
ENVIRONMENTAL DECISIONS THAT WE

02:40:04.161 --> 02:40:07.631
HAVE TO MAKE WITH A PROBLEM THAT

02:40:07.698 --> 02:40:09.700
YORK THEY FROZE SUBWAY CARS AND

02:40:09.766 --> 02:40:11.134
YOU'RE RIGHT TIRES OFF OF

02:40:11.201 --> 02:40:12.970
FLORIDA. AND OUR OCEANS ARE NOT

02:40:13.036 --> 02:40:14.604
A DUMPING GROUND AND THIS IS A

02:40:14.671 --> 02:40:16.173
MOMENT WHERE WE NEED TO LOOK AT

02:40:16.239 --> 02:40:17.708
AN EXISTING PROBLEM AND

02:40:17.774 --> 02:40:19.409
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE BEST

02:40:19.476 --> 02:40:21.545
ENVIRONMENTAL OPTION IS. AND I

02:40:21.611 --> 02:40:23.146
THINK THAT WE CAN FALL BACK ON
