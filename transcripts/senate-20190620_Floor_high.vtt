00:29:24.462 --> 00:29:24.996
ELEVEN HUNDRED STRUCTURES AND

00:29:25.063 --> 00:29:26.698
SEVEN LIVES.

00:29:26.764 --> 00:29:29.400
WE HAD A FIRE TORNADO.

00:29:29.467 --> 00:29:31.202
WE HAVE AYE FIVE RUNNING UP TO

00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:33.371
THE MIDDLE OF THE CITY WE HAD TO

00:29:33.438 --> 00:29:35.039
NINETY NINE WHICH RUNS.

00:29:35.106 --> 00:29:36.174
ACROSS WAYS AND WE ARE TRYING TO

00:29:36.241 --> 00:29:38.276
MOVE PEOPLE.

00:29:38.343 --> 00:29:40.578
AROUND OUR CITY AND SAVE LIVES

00:29:40.645 --> 00:29:42.080
AND WE HAD EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES

00:29:42.147 --> 00:29:44.115
OUR SYSTEM IS NOT BEEN UPDATED

00:29:44.182 --> 00:29:46.351
IN FAILED US.

00:29:46.417 --> 00:29:48.419
THEN ON TOP OF THAT.

00:29:48.486 --> 00:29:49.754
WE HAD THE CAMP FIRE WHICH

00:29:49.821 --> 00:29:52.257
HAPPENED FOUR MONTHS LATER.

00:29:52.323 --> 00:29:53.791
AND WE LOST EIGHTY SEVEN LIVES

00:29:53.858 --> 00:29:56.861
IN PARADISE.

00:29:56.928 --> 00:29:58.963
I REPRESENT MIGUEL YEAH.

00:29:59.030 --> 00:29:59.931
WHICH HAS.

00:29:59.998 --> 00:30:01.633
ELEVEN A NINETY I DID REPRESENT

00:30:01.699 --> 00:30:03.234
ME I IT'S IT'S NOT MY SENATE

00:30:03.301 --> 00:30:04.302
DISTRICT.

00:30:04.369 --> 00:30:05.670
BUT WHEN I FIRST REPRESENTED

00:30:05.737 --> 00:30:07.605
THAT AREA I WENT OUT AND LOOKED

00:30:07.672 --> 00:30:08.706
AND I KNEW THAT THERE WAS THERE

00:30:08.773 --> 00:30:10.208
WAS A FIRE PRONE AREA AND THAT

00:30:10.275 --> 00:30:11.643
THERE WAS SOME POINT THERE WOULD

00:30:11.709 --> 00:30:13.144
BE A FIRE THERE SO WE PUT IN A

00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:15.079
ACCESS ROAD.

00:30:15.146 --> 00:30:17.048
ACTUALLY ADMITTED A BILL TO HAVE

00:30:17.115 --> 00:30:17.882
AN X. CAPER OUT FROM THE

00:30:17.949 --> 00:30:19.951
GALLERIA.

00:30:20.018 --> 00:30:21.920
AND WITH THE FIRE FOR THE

00:30:21.986 --> 00:30:23.288
CAMPFIRE CAME THROUGH.

00:30:23.354 --> 00:30:24.789
MANY PEOPLE DID NOT KNOW THAT

00:30:24.856 --> 00:30:26.124
THAT ROUTE WAS AVAILABLE AND

00:30:26.191 --> 00:30:28.459
THEY WENT DOWN THE HILL INSTEAD

00:30:28.526 --> 00:30:30.328
OF GOING UP THE HILL.

00:30:30.395 --> 00:30:31.462
IF THIS SYSTEM WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:30:31.529 --> 00:30:33.431
IN PLACE AND EXERCISE AND

00:30:33.498 --> 00:30:34.899
WARNINGS I THINK.

00:30:34.966 --> 00:30:36.000
THE OUTCOME WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:30:36.067 --> 00:30:37.368
SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT.

00:30:37.435 --> 00:30:40.371
I'M NOT GONNA SAY THAT THE NINE

00:30:40.438 --> 00:30:40.738
ONE ONE SYSTEM.

00:30:40.805 --> 00:30:41.506
IS GONNA.

00:30:41.573 --> 00:30:43.374
EVERY TIME SAVE LIVES.

00:30:43.441 --> 00:30:44.609
BUT THIS SYSTEM IS BROKEN AND ON

00:30:44.676 --> 00:30:46.344
TOP OF THAT.

00:30:46.411 --> 00:30:47.879
MANY PEOPLE THAT PAY INTO THE

00:30:47.946 --> 00:30:49.280
SYSTEM IT WAS BASED OFF OF LAND

00:30:49.347 --> 00:30:51.049
LINES.

00:30:51.115 --> 00:30:52.984
THEN WE ADDED CELL PHONES.

00:30:53.051 --> 00:30:54.919
AND THERE'S STILL PEOPLE WHO USE

00:30:54.986 --> 00:30:56.154
THE SERVICE WHO DON'T PAY INTO

00:30:56.221 --> 00:30:57.322
THE SERVICE [inaudible]

00:30:57.388 --> 00:30:59.557
NOW.

00:30:59.624 --> 00:31:00.058
I LOOK AT THIS PIECE OF

00:31:00.124 --> 00:31:01.593
LEGISLATION.

00:31:01.659 --> 00:31:02.727
THERE'S A LOT TO DEBATE WHETHER

00:31:02.794 --> 00:31:04.362
SHOULD BE.

00:31:04.429 --> 00:31:06.331
IT IN YOU KNOW TAXES AND FEES

00:31:06.397 --> 00:31:08.800
AND I LOOK AT WHAT GOVERNMENT'S

00:31:08.866 --> 00:31:09.934
PRIMARY FUNCTIONS ARE

00:31:10.001 --> 00:31:12.370
[inaudible] FOR ME.

00:31:12.437 --> 00:31:14.505
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO THINGS.

00:31:14.572 --> 00:31:15.073
THAT THE PEOPLE CAN'T DO ON

00:31:15.139 --> 00:31:17.375
THEIR OWN. TO COLLECTIVELY WE

00:31:17.442 --> 00:31:19.277
PUT IN WATER SYSTEM SO WE CAN

00:31:19.344 --> 00:31:20.044
ALL HAVE WATER SO WILL PAY A

00:31:20.111 --> 00:31:20.478
LITTLE BIT.

00:31:20.545 --> 00:31:22.313
COLLECTIVELY WE BUILD

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:25.116
INFRASTRUCTURE ROADS SCHOOLS WE

00:31:25.183 --> 00:31:27.051
PROTECT OUR NATION.

00:31:27.118 --> 00:31:28.119
THOSE ARE THINGS THE GOVERNMENT

00:31:28.186 --> 00:31:29.721
IS SUPPOSED TO DO.

00:31:29.787 --> 00:31:31.189
AND I BELIEVE THAT PUBLIC SAFETY

00:31:31.256 --> 00:31:33.224
IS ONE OF THOSE FIRST ISSUES

00:31:33.291 --> 00:31:36.060
THAT WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT.

00:31:36.127 --> 00:31:38.696
pPERFECT NOW.

00:31:38.763 --> 00:31:40.031
BUT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

00:31:40.098 --> 00:31:41.466
ALONG THE WAY.

00:31:41.532 --> 00:31:43.201
CHECK IN AND HELP.

00:31:43.268 --> 00:31:44.902
CRAFTED IN A WAY THAT WILL MAKE

00:31:44.969 --> 00:31:47.338
OUR COMMUNITIES MORE SAFE.

00:31:47.405 --> 00:31:48.439
AND A SYSTEM THAT WORKS I WANT

00:31:48.506 --> 00:31:49.874
TO ALSO PAINT A PICTURE I

00:31:49.941 --> 00:31:52.377
REPRESENT A DISTRICT.

00:31:52.443 --> 00:31:53.811
MY ASSEMBLY DISTRICT PART OF MY

00:31:53.878 --> 00:31:55.980
SENATE DISTRICT IS WAS TWENTY

00:31:56.047 --> 00:31:57.849
FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE MILES.

00:31:57.915 --> 00:32:00.084
MY WIFE AND I TRAVEL THOSE ROADS.

00:32:00.151 --> 00:32:01.152
AND NOT EVERYWHERE DO YOU HAVE

00:32:01.219 --> 00:32:02.920
CELL SERVICE OUT THERE.

00:32:02.987 --> 00:32:04.889
WE CAME UPON AN ACCIDENT.

00:32:04.956 --> 00:32:06.991
WHERE LIVES WERE THREATENED WE

00:32:07.058 --> 00:32:09.160
HAD A DRIVE A FEW MILES BEFORE

00:32:09.227 --> 00:32:10.862
WE GOT CELL SERVICE?

00:32:10.928 --> 00:32:13.731
AND WHEN WE CALLED.

00:32:13.798 --> 00:32:14.299
NINE ONE ONE THEY DON'T KNOW

00:32:14.365 --> 00:32:16.968
WHERE YOU'RE AT SO IT CAN BE YOU

00:32:17.035 --> 00:32:18.403
CAN BE LASSEN COUNTY AND THE

00:32:18.469 --> 00:32:20.004
CALL MAY GO TO MODOC COUNTY.

00:32:20.071 --> 00:32:21.406
THEN HAS TO BE RE ROUTED FROM

00:32:21.472 --> 00:32:24.742
THE C. H. P.. TO THE CALL CENTER

00:32:24.809 --> 00:32:25.343
TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE HECK

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:27.111
YOU'RE OUT OUT THERE.

00:32:27.178 --> 00:32:28.546
THEN AFTER TWENTY MINUTES OF

00:32:28.613 --> 00:32:30.415
GETTING RE ROUTED AND TELLING

00:32:30.481 --> 00:32:32.383
THEM WE HAVE A EMERGENCY.

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:34.352
THEN WE GO BACK AND TELL THE

00:32:34.419 --> 00:32:35.720
PEOPLE WE HAVE HELP ON THE WAY

00:32:35.787 --> 00:32:37.755
WHICH IN THIS CASE IS.

00:32:37.822 --> 00:32:39.257
OURS IN SOME CASES FOR UP TO AN

00:32:39.324 --> 00:32:40.591
HOUR TO GET FIRST RESPONDERS

00:32:40.658 --> 00:32:42.327
THERE.

00:32:42.393 --> 00:32:43.995
SO I THINK THIS IS A GREAT PIECE

00:32:44.062 --> 00:32:46.297
OF LEGISLATION I AM VERY HAPPY

00:32:46.364 --> 00:32:47.465
TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT I DON'T

00:32:47.532 --> 00:32:48.966
I DON'T KNOW WHERE MARK GILL OUR

00:32:49.033 --> 00:32:50.268
DUTY IS IF HE'S IN HERE I WANT

00:32:50.335 --> 00:32:52.170
TO SAY I KEPT MY PROMISE TO YOU

00:32:52.236 --> 00:32:53.638
I THE BILL DID NOT GET. TO THE

00:32:53.705 --> 00:32:55.006
ASSEMBLY LAST YEAR AND I TOLD

00:32:55.073 --> 00:32:56.841
HIM OUT TO THE CAR FIRE I WOULD

00:32:56.908 --> 00:32:57.709
VOTE FOR THIS BILL.

00:32:57.775 --> 00:32:58.509
I WANT TO KEEP MY WORD I'M GONNA

00:32:58.576 --> 00:32:59.677
VOTE FOR THIS BILL TODAY I THINK

00:32:59.744 --> 00:33:01.012
IT'S A GOOD BILL I THINK IT

00:33:01.079 --> 00:33:02.714
NEEDS A LITTLE BIT OF WORK --

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:03.848
BUT I THINK THIS IS WHAT

00:33:03.915 --> 00:33:05.616
GOVERNMENT IS SUPPOSED TO DO.

00:33:05.683 --> 00:33:07.018
COLLECTIVELY WE ARE SUPPOSED TO

00:33:07.085 --> 00:33:08.886
GET EVERYBODY THE TABLE.

00:33:08.953 --> 00:33:10.054
EVERYBODY'S USING THE SERVICE

00:33:10.121 --> 00:33:11.889
SHOULD PAY A LITTLE BIT.

00:33:11.956 --> 00:33:13.257
AND WE SHOULD PUT TOGETHER A

00:33:13.324 --> 00:33:15.193
SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS US TO KEEP

00:33:15.259 --> 00:33:17.362
OUR COMMUNITY SAFE.

00:33:17.428 --> 00:33:18.830
NOW THIS CLOSE WITH THIS I HAVE

00:33:18.896 --> 00:33:19.464
A NINE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER ROSLIN

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:20.365
WHO.

00:33:20.431 --> 00:33:21.666
CANNOT HAVE A CELLPHONE UNTIL

00:33:21.733 --> 00:33:24.035
SHE'S.

00:33:24.102 --> 00:33:24.669
THIRTEEN THAT'S THE RULE IN THE

00:33:24.736 --> 00:33:25.937
DELI HOUSE.

00:33:26.003 --> 00:33:27.805
BUT WHAT SHE HAS THAT PHONE.

00:33:27.872 --> 00:33:29.841
I WANT HER TO BE ABLE TO DIAL

00:33:29.907 --> 00:33:30.908
911- IF SHE NEEDS ANYTHING IF

00:33:30.975 --> 00:33:32.477
SHE'S BEEN ASSAULTED IF SHE'S

00:33:32.543 --> 00:33:34.278
WHATEVER IT MAY BE AND IT.

00:33:34.345 --> 00:33:37.582
THE RESPONSE TO BE QUICK TO HER.

00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:39.450
SO I URGE AN AYE VOTE I THINK

00:33:39.517 --> 00:33:40.952
YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK ON

00:33:41.018 --> 00:33:42.186

YOUR DUTY AND THE GOVERNOR --

00:33:46.991 --> 00:33:48.860
FOR AND THEN THE REST OF PEOPLE

00:33:48.926 --> 00:33:49.427
THAT WORK ON THIS BILL IS A

00:33:49.494 --> 00:33:51.195
TOUGH BILL.

00:33:51.262 --> 00:33:51.796
BUT IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO

00:33:51.863 --> 00:33:52.897
THANK YOU.

00:33:52.964 --> 00:33:58.336
THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON.

00:33:58.403 --> 00:34:00.872
HI TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS

00:34:00.938 --> 00:34:02.306
MEASURE AND APPRECIATE THE THE

00:34:02.373 --> 00:34:05.076
WISE WORDS OF OUR NEWEST MEMBER

00:34:05.143 --> 00:34:06.444
ONE OF OUR NEWEST MEMBERS THE

00:34:06.511 --> 00:34:07.712
GOOD SENATOR FROM.

00:34:07.779 --> 00:34:12.417
I BELIEVE IT'S BIEBER -- AS THE

00:34:12.483 --> 00:34:14.886
THE VICE CHAIR IN IS THE FORMER

00:34:14.952 --> 00:34:16.821
CHAIR OF THE JOINT aMITTEE

00:34:16.888 --> 00:34:19.023
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT I TO SHARE

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:20.158
THE BELIEVE.

00:34:20.224 --> 00:34:21.492
THE ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL

00:34:21.559 --> 00:34:23.795
RESPONSIBILITIES OF GOVERNMENT

00:34:23.861 --> 00:34:25.463
IS THE SAFETY OF ITS PEOPLE.

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:27.031
AND SO TO ME THIS IS NOT A

00:34:27.098 --> 00:34:28.499
PARTISAN BILL.

00:34:28.566 --> 00:34:31.969
THIS IS NOT AN IDEOLOGICAL BILL.

00:34:32.036 --> 00:34:33.604
THIS IS A PRAGMATIC BILL THAT

00:34:33.671 --> 00:34:35.940
WILL GO A LONG WAY TO ASSISTING

00:34:36.007 --> 00:34:37.375
AND HELPING.

00:34:37.442 --> 00:34:39.110
MEET THAT PROMISE OF GOVERNMENT

00:34:39.177 --> 00:34:43.080
TO KEEP OURS OUR COMMUNITY SAFE.

00:34:43.147 --> 00:34:43.915
LIKE THE GOOD SENATOR FROM

00:34:43.981 --> 00:34:45.917
BIEBER I HAVE A STORY ABOUT THE

00:34:45.983 --> 00:34:48.486
INADEQUACIES OF OUR CURRENT NINE

00:34:48.553 --> 00:34:50.021
ONE ONE SYSTEM EVEN IN OUR NON

00:34:50.087 --> 00:34:51.422
RURAL AREA.

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:52.924
WHERE THE PINKING THAT WENT ON

00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:55.159
MISDIRECTED THE MOST CRITICAL

00:34:55.226 --> 00:34:57.528
EMT SERVICES THAT HAD THEY BEEN

00:34:57.595 --> 00:34:58.763
MORE ACCURATE WOULD HAVE SAVED

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:00.364
THE LIFE?

00:35:00.431 --> 00:35:02.033
IN MY COMMUNITY WHICH WAS LOST

00:35:02.099 --> 00:35:03.835
AS A RESULT.

00:35:03.901 --> 00:35:05.102
COLLEAGUES THIS SYSTEM IS FORTY

00:35:05.169 --> 00:35:06.604
YEARS OLD.

00:35:06.671 --> 00:35:07.872
AND FOR THOSE OF US WHO CAN

00:35:07.939 --> 00:35:11.008
REMEMBER BACK FORTY YEARS OLD WE

00:35:11.075 --> 00:35:13.211
HAD DIAL TELEPHONES.

00:35:13.277 --> 00:35:14.745
WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE INTERNET

00:35:14.812 --> 00:35:16.647
WAS I HAD NO IDEA WHAT A

00:35:16.714 --> 00:35:18.449
GIGABYTE WAS.

00:35:18.516 --> 00:35:20.451
WHAT IS CELL PHONE WAS THAT'S

00:35:20.518 --> 00:35:22.220
FORTY YEARS AGO THERE WAS NO

00:35:22.286 --> 00:35:24.622
ANALOG THERE WAS NO DIGITAL?

00:35:24.689 --> 00:35:26.190
THERE WAS NOTHING LIKE WHAT WE

00:35:26.257 --> 00:35:28.926
HAVE TODAY AND HERE THE STATE

00:35:28.993 --> 00:35:30.595
THAT INVENTS THE FUTURE.

00:35:30.661 --> 00:35:32.663
THAT IS THE HOME OF THE ADVANCED

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:34.131
TECHNOLOGIES.

00:35:34.198 --> 00:35:36.501
THE FACT THAT WE ARE ONLY ONE OF

00:35:36.567 --> 00:35:38.769
THREE STATES LEFT IN THE ENTIRE

00:35:38.836 --> 00:35:40.705
UNITED STATES.

00:35:40.771 --> 00:35:42.673
THAT HAS FAILED TO UPGRADE TO

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:44.075
THE SYSTEM.

00:35:44.141 --> 00:35:46.410
IS FRANKLY APPALLING.

00:35:46.477 --> 00:35:49.213
AND WHETHER YOU THINK IT THIS IS

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.715
TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE.

00:35:50.781 --> 00:35:53.050
THE FACT IS WHAT IS A LIFE WORTH

00:35:53.117 --> 00:35:54.385
TO YOU.

00:35:54.452 --> 00:35:56.187
BECAUSE WHEN WE HAVE FIRES WHEN

00:35:56.254 --> 00:35:58.556
WE HAVE EMERGENCIES WE NEED TO

00:35:58.623 --> 00:36:00.958
GET WHAT WE CALL REDUNDANCY WE

00:36:01.025 --> 00:36:03.528
NEED EVERY WAY POSSIBLE TO LET

00:36:03.594 --> 00:36:04.762
PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY ARE IN

00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:06.664
DANGER.

00:36:06.731 --> 00:36:08.399
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST ADVANCED

00:36:08.466 --> 00:36:11.369
WAYS WE CAN DO THAT WE WOULD BE

00:36:11.435 --> 00:36:13.337
REMISS IN OUR RESPONSIBILITIES

00:36:13.404 --> 00:36:14.572
IF WE DIDN'T DO THAT.

00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:16.207
AND SO THERE'S AN ARGUMENT ABOUT

00:36:16.274 --> 00:36:18.242
WHETHER SHE WE TAX PEOPLE OR

00:36:18.309 --> 00:36:20.578
SHOULD WE TAKE A ONE TIME FEE.

00:36:20.645 --> 00:36:22.947
I ASK YOU THIS WHAT IS A LIFE

00:36:23.014 --> 00:36:24.715
WORTH TO YOU.

00:36:24.782 --> 00:36:27.585
WHAT IS YOUR HOME WORTH TO YOU?

00:36:27.652 --> 00:36:29.854
WHAT IS YOUR?

00:36:29.921 --> 00:36:31.589
LARGE STOCK WORK DO YOU FOR YOUR

00:36:31.656 --> 00:36:33.858
PETS AND THE ANSWER IS.

00:36:33.925 --> 00:36:36.327
IT'S WORTH FOR MORE THAN ARGUING

00:36:36.394 --> 00:36:39.096
OVER WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE A

00:36:39.163 --> 00:36:40.631
ONE TIME.

00:36:40.698 --> 00:36:42.300
THE INFLUX OF MONEY IN FACT IT

00:36:42.366 --> 00:36:44.435
CAN'T BE BECAUSE HE SYSTEM WILL

00:36:44.502 --> 00:36:46.971
CONTINUE TO BE REVISED AS

00:36:47.038 --> 00:36:49.574
TECHNOLOGIES IMPROVE WE NEED TO

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.809
WE WANT WE DESERVE.

00:36:51.876 --> 00:36:53.411
THE MOST ADVANCED WARNING

00:36:53.477 --> 00:36:55.546
SYSTEMS IN A STATE WHERE RIGHT

00:36:55.613 --> 00:36:58.749
NOW WE ARE UNDER FIRE ALERT THIS

00:36:58.816 --> 00:37:00.885
VERY MINUTE AS WE SPEAK.

00:37:00.952 --> 00:37:02.153
AND AS THE GOOD SENATOR FROM

00:37:02.219 --> 00:37:03.854
BEEPER AND OTHER COLLEAGUES OF

00:37:03.921 --> 00:37:06.057
MINE HAVE THE EXPERIENCE THESE

00:37:06.123 --> 00:37:08.092
WILDFIRES AND HOW QUICKLY THEY

00:37:08.159 --> 00:37:08.993
MOVE.

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:10.795
ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING WE CAN

00:37:10.861 --> 00:37:12.363
DO TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF DANGER

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:14.765
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IT IS OUR

00:37:14.832 --> 00:37:17.969
RESPONSIBILITY AND SO I STAND IN

00:37:18.035 --> 00:37:20.605
STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS EFFORT.

00:37:20.671 --> 00:37:22.073
WHETHER IT'S FR WILDFIRES

00:37:22.139 --> 00:37:24.241
WHETHER IT IS FOR A CHILD AT

00:37:24.308 --> 00:37:26.310
HOME DURING A BREAK IN ONE OF

00:37:26.377 --> 00:37:27.478
THE THINGS THAT THE SYSTEM WILL

00:37:27.545 --> 00:37:29.280
DO IT WILL ALLOW THOSE WHO

00:37:29.347 --> 00:37:32.817
EITHER CAN'T GET PHONE SERVICE.

00:37:32.883 --> 00:37:34.285
OR ARE UNABLE TO USE THE PHONE

00:37:34.352 --> 00:37:36.454
TO BE ABLE TO TAXED OR VIDEO

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:39.857
THEIR CONCERNS IF THERE IS A A

00:37:39.924 --> 00:37:41.292
PREDATOR IN ONE'S HOME A FEW

00:37:41.359 --> 00:37:42.727
YEARS SUBJECT OF A BURGLARY YOU

00:37:42.793 --> 00:37:44.261
DON'T WANT TO GET ON THE PHONE

00:37:44.328 --> 00:37:45.262
AND CALL.

00:37:45.329 --> 00:37:47.231
WITH THIS SYSTEM YOU'LL BE ABLE

00:37:47.298 --> 00:37:49.800
TO TEXT THE EMERGENCY SYSTEM

00:37:49.867 --> 00:37:51.535

DOWNTOWN SANTA BARBARA OR OTHER

00:37:59.477 --> 00:38:04.348
PLACES WE WILL BE ABLE TO HELP.

00:38:04.415 --> 00:38:05.650
AND THAT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY

00:38:05.716 --> 00:38:06.417
FOR GOVERNMENT.

00:38:06.484 --> 00:38:08.619
REGARDLESS OF PARTY REGARDLESS

00:38:08.686 --> 00:38:10.955
OF IDEOLOGY THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

00:38:11.022 --> 00:38:14.258
MEASURE AND I RESPECTFULLY URGE

00:38:14.325 --> 00:38:15.826
AN AYE VOTE ON IT.

00:38:15.893 --> 00:38:23.501
THANK YOU SENATOR BATES

00:38:23.868 --> 00:38:26.604
HELP CENTER.

00:38:26.671 --> 00:38:27.271
I'M SORRY.

00:38:27.338 --> 00:38:29.006
MISTER PRESIDENT I DIDN'T

00:38:29.073 --> 00:38:32.143
RECOGNIZE MY NAME.

00:38:32.209 --> 00:38:33.477
GOT A LITTLE HEARING PROBLEM

00:38:33.544 --> 00:38:33.978
TODAY.

00:38:34.045 --> 00:38:36.814
BUT I DO RESPECTFULLY ROUTE RISE

00:38:36.881 --> 00:38:38.716
IN OPPOSITION OB PROBABLY BETTER

00:38:38.783 --> 00:38:39.817
SAY IT SAID I WILL NOT BE ABLE

00:38:39.884 --> 00:38:40.885
TO SUPPORT.

00:38:40.951 --> 00:38:42.820
OUR THE MEASURE TODAY I DO NOT

00:38:42.887 --> 00:38:44.588
DISAGREE THAT WE NEED TO A NEW

00:38:44.655 --> 00:38:46.991
MODERNIZE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM.

00:38:47.058 --> 00:38:48.993
ARE CERTAINLY ONE THAT INVOLVES

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.695
WITH CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY BUT

00:38:50.761 --> 00:38:53.030
THIS PROPOSAL REMAINS FLAWED AND

00:38:53.097 --> 00:38:54.565
WE DEALT WITH THAT LAST YEAR ON

00:38:54.632 --> 00:38:55.966
SOME OF THE SAME ISSUES I'M

00:38:56.033 --> 00:38:57.234
GOING TO RAISE.

00:38:57.301 --> 00:38:59.203
IT'S A BLANK CHECK IT LACKS A

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:00.404
CLEAR PLAN AND IT LACKS

00:39:00.471 --> 00:39:01.906
ACCOUNTABILITY AND MOST

00:39:01.972 --> 00:39:03.240
IMPORTANTLY BASED ON THE

00:39:03.307 --> 00:39:05.109
PREVIOUS DISCUSSION FROM MY

00:39:05.176 --> 00:39:07.478
FELLOW MEMBERS -- THERE IS NO NO

00:39:07.545 --> 00:39:09.513
ASSURANCE THAT THIS IS GOING TO

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:10.981
HAPPEN IN THE NEAR TERM.

00:39:11.048 --> 00:39:12.149
THE CURRENT TAX THAT WE HAVE

00:39:12.216 --> 00:39:14.418
GENERATES APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY

00:39:14.485 --> 00:39:16.120
MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY AND

00:39:16.187 --> 00:39:17.388
THAT'S LEVY DON AS WE KNOW BOTH

00:39:17.455 --> 00:39:19.724
LAND LINES AND WIRELESS ACCOUNTS.

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:21.492
THIS PROPOSAL INCREASES AND

00:39:21.559 --> 00:39:22.927
BROADENS THE NINE ONE ONE TAX

00:39:22.993 --> 00:39:24.628
BASED UPON THE NUMBER OF ACCESS

00:39:24.695 --> 00:39:25.596
LINES.

00:39:25.663 --> 00:39:27.098
I RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO BROADEN

00:39:27.164 --> 00:39:29.066
THE TAX AS A MATTER OF FAIRNESS

00:39:29.133 --> 00:39:30.301
AND STABILITY.

00:39:30.367 --> 00:39:31.969
UNFORTUNATELY THIS PROPOSAL

00:39:32.036 --> 00:39:34.171
ALLOWS THE ADMINISTRATION AND I

00:39:34.238 --> 00:39:36.140
WANT TO EMPHASIZE THIS MEMBERS

00:39:36.207 --> 00:39:38.109
NOT US NOT LEGISLATIVE MEMBERS

00:39:38.175 --> 00:39:40.044
NOT OUR REPRESENTATIVES OF THOSE

00:39:40.111 --> 00:39:41.779
PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE PROMISED TO

00:39:41.846 --> 00:39:43.214
ENSURE THEIR SAFETY.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.115
IT REMAINS WITH THE

00:39:44.181 --> 00:39:46.450
ADMINISTRATION TO INCREASE THE

00:39:46.517 --> 00:39:48.385
TAX RATE TO GENERATE A TOTAL OF

00:39:48.452 --> 00:39:50.421
ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION

00:39:50.488 --> 00:39:53.357
DOLLARS ANNUALLY ON GOING.

00:39:53.424 --> 00:39:54.391
THE UPPER CAP OF EIGHTY CENTS

00:39:54.458 --> 00:39:55.926
WOULD GENERATE MORE THAN TWICE

00:39:55.993 --> 00:39:59.029
AS MUCH REVENUE AS YES THINKS

00:39:59.096 --> 00:40:01.265
LET ME EMPHASIZE THAT THINKS IT

00:40:01.332 --> 00:40:02.066
NEEDS.

00:40:02.133 --> 00:40:03.768
ARE WHAT IS THE TOTAL COSTS

00:40:03.834 --> 00:40:06.003
NEEDED FOR NINE ONE ONE UPDATE.

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:07.004
ON MEETING WITH THE GOVERNOR

00:40:07.071 --> 00:40:10.074
LAST YEAR THAT THAT QUESTION WAS

00:40:10.141 --> 00:40:11.709
BOB POSED -- TO YES THEY COULD

00:40:11.776 --> 00:40:13.277
NOT ANSWER THE QUESTION WHAT

00:40:13.344 --> 00:40:14.945
WILL THE COST OF THE ANNUAL

00:40:15.012 --> 00:40:16.580
OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE NEED

00:40:16.647 --> 00:40:18.649
GOVERNOR BROWN ASKED DIRECTLY TO

00:40:18.716 --> 00:40:20.117
THE OYSTER AFTER.

00:40:20.184 --> 00:40:21.752
THERE WAS NOT AN ANSWER WHEN

00:40:21.819 --> 00:40:23.254
WILL THE PROJECT BE COMPLETED

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.755
AND WE HAVE JUST HEARD HOW

00:40:24.822 --> 00:40:26.557
URGENT HOW URGENT THAT IS NEEDED

00:40:26.624 --> 00:40:32.296
BECAUSE WE ARE FACING MAJOR

00:40:32.363 --> 00:40:34.064
CLIMATE CHANGES THAT DRIVEN SOME

00:40:34.131 --> 00:40:34.698
OF THESE HORRIBLE CATASTROPHES.

00:40:34.765 --> 00:40:35.766
WE DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER TO THAT

00:40:35.833 --> 00:40:36.567
AND WE LOOK AT OUR OTHER OUR

00:40:36.634 --> 00:40:38.102
TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS HERE IN OUR

00:40:38.169 --> 00:40:40.104
STATEGOVERNMENT AW THEY HAVE

00:40:40.171 --> 00:40:42.473
NOT -- MATT WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:44.308
INTENDED WHAT IF THIS SYSTEM

00:40:44.375 --> 00:40:45.910
DOES NOT THERE HAVE BEEN NO

00:40:45.976 --> 00:40:47.611
CLEAR ANSWERS AND WE DESERVE

00:40:47.678 --> 00:40:49.847
THESE ANSWERS NOW IF WE ARE TO

00:40:49.914 --> 00:40:52.449
ENSURE TO ENSURE THE SAFETY.

00:40:52.516 --> 00:40:54.118
OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN SO

00:40:54.185 --> 00:40:58.189
DEVASTATED -- AND POPE TENSELY

00:40:58.255 --> 00:40:59.723
THAT CAN HAPPEN IN THE NEAR

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:01.826
FUTURE SO WE NEED IMMEDIATE

00:41:01.892 --> 00:41:02.760
ANSWERS.

00:41:02.827 --> 00:41:04.328
THE SAD TRUTH IS THAT OUR STATE

00:41:04.395 --> 00:41:05.696
GOVERNMENT HOUSE SUPPORT TRACK

00:41:05.763 --> 00:41:07.131
RECORD WHEN IT COMES TO

00:41:07.198 --> 00:41:08.399
DELIVERING PROJECTS HAD BEEN

00:41:08.465 --> 00:41:10.034
PROMISED TO EACH AND EVERYONE OF

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:10.935
US.

00:41:11.001 --> 00:41:12.436
IN A VARIETY OF OUR COMMITTEES

00:41:12.503 --> 00:41:13.838
STATE REPUBLICAN SENATE

00:41:13.904 --> 00:41:15.773
REPUBLICANS DID PROPOSE THAT THE

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.541
GENERAL FUND BE USED TO PAY JUST

00:41:17.608 --> 00:41:19.009
FOR THE DEVELOPMENT TO GET IT

00:41:19.076 --> 00:41:20.611
GOING TO BUILD OUT THE NEW ONE

00:41:20.678 --> 00:41:22.213
ONE SYSTEM LET'S ET IT GOING.

00:41:22.279 --> 00:41:24.348
THIS WOULD EXPEDITE THE PROJECT

00:41:24.415 --> 00:41:25.850
LAST YEAR WE HAD TEN MILLION

00:41:25.916 --> 00:41:27.451
DOLLARS FOR EACH EACH MARINE

00:41:27.518 --> 00:41:28.385
MUSEUM.

00:41:28.452 --> 00:41:29.854
THIS YEAR WE HAVE MILLIONS OF

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.522
DOLLARS FOR DOG PARKS AND SUMMER

00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:33.924
CAMPS SURELY SURELY WE HAVE

00:41:33.991 --> 00:41:34.458
MONEY.

00:41:34.525 --> 00:41:36.961
OUR TO FIND A NEW NINE ONE ONE

00:41:37.027 --> 00:41:39.230
SYSTEM BUILD OUT IMMEDIATELY

00:41:39.296 --> 00:41:40.598
ONCE THE SYSTEM IS OPERATIONAL

00:41:40.664 --> 00:41:42.833
DOWN WE WOULD BE ABLE TO WORK

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:44.602
OUT WHAT THE NEEDS WOULD BE FROM

00:41:44.668 --> 00:41:45.936
ABROAD IN TAX STRUCTURE THAT I

00:41:46.003 --> 00:41:47.271
THINK WE WOULD ALL BE VERY VERY

00:41:47.338 --> 00:41:48.606
SUPPORTIVE UP.

00:41:48.672 --> 00:41:50.174
BECAUSE WE DO NEED TO FUND THE

00:41:50.241 --> 00:41:52.209
OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE AND

00:41:52.276 --> 00:41:52.776
ANY UPGRADES THAT WOULD BE

00:41:52.843 --> 00:41:53.644
NEEDED.

00:41:53.711 --> 00:41:55.746
THEREFORE WE WOULD REQUEST THAT

00:41:55.813 --> 00:41:57.381
A LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL AT LEAST

00:41:57.448 --> 00:41:59.250
BE REQUIRED FOR FUTURE RATE

00:41:59.316 --> 00:42:00.885
INCREASES AND TO KNOW OUR WHAT

00:42:00.951 --> 00:42:02.686
IS WORKING IN TERMS OF THE

00:42:02.753 --> 00:42:04.221
DEVELOPMENT WHAT IS NOT WORKING.

00:42:04.288 --> 00:42:05.522
WE WOULD ALSO REQUEST THAT THERE

00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:07.691
BE TRANSPARENCY AND REPORTING TO

00:42:07.758 --> 00:42:09.393
THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:11.195
ACCOUNTABILITY ON THE PART OF

00:42:11.262 --> 00:42:12.263
THE ADMINISTRATION.

00:42:12.329 --> 00:42:14.164
THIS WOULD PROVIDE FOR SOME

00:42:14.231 --> 00:42:15.699
ASSURANCE OF THE PROJECT GETS

00:42:15.766 --> 00:42:18.202
BUILT GETS BUILT QUICKLY IN THAT

00:42:18.269 --> 00:42:20.437
IT ACTUALLY WORKS -- YES ONCE A

00:42:20.504 --> 00:42:21.872
BLANK CHECK THE LEGISLATURE GETS

00:42:21.939 --> 00:42:23.941
NO CERTAINTY THAT THE PROJECT

00:42:24.008 --> 00:42:25.643
GETS BUILT OR THAT IT WORKS AND

00:42:25.709 --> 00:42:27.578
WE HAVE THE EXPERIENCE THAT AND

00:42:27.645 --> 00:42:33.317
I DON'T WANT TO MENTION THE

00:42:33.384 --> 00:42:33.617
DIFFERENCE.

00:42:33.684 --> 00:42:35.786
BOB IBM'S THAT WE'VE HAD WITH

00:42:35.853 --> 00:42:37.154
SOME OF OUR AGENCIES BUT IT'S A

00:42:37.221 --> 00:42:38.656
FACT SO SHOULD WE ENSURE THAT

00:42:38.722 --> 00:42:39.657
THIS IS NOT GOING TO FALL.

00:42:39.723 --> 00:42:40.424
ON THE SAME PROBLEM WE'RE ALSO

00:42:40.491 --> 00:42:41.091
BEING ASKED TO PROVIDE A MASSIVE

00:42:41.158 --> 00:42:41.659
TAX INCREASE IN PERPETUITY

00:42:41.725 --> 00:42:42.293
WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT THE COSTS

00:42:42.359 --> 00:42:43.327
OF OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE

00:42:43.394 --> 00:42:44.261
WILL BE.

00:42:44.328 --> 00:42:45.696
I DO BELIEVE WE CAN DO BETTER WE

00:42:45.763 --> 00:42:48.232
TRIED LAST YEAR I WOULD LIKE TO

00:42:48.299 --> 00:42:50.200
REMIND US ALL THAT -- YES IS HAD

00:42:50.267 --> 00:42:52.036
ONE WHOLE YEAR TO COME OUT WITH

00:42:52.102 --> 00:42:53.604
AT LEAST WHAT THEY WERE GONNA

00:42:53.671 --> 00:42:55.205
PUT IN OUR IF P. AS THEY WENT

00:42:55.272 --> 00:42:56.340
OUT TO BID ON THIS PROJECT.

00:42:56.407 --> 00:42:57.775
AND I HAVING SERVED AT THE

00:42:57.841 --> 00:42:59.076
COUNTY GOVERNMENT THIS WOULD

00:42:59.143 --> 00:43:00.945
NEVER HAPPEN IN YOUR COUNTY

00:43:01.011 --> 00:43:02.713
GOVERNMENTS THAT SOMEONE COULD

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:03.914
TAKE A YEAR.

00:43:03.981 --> 00:43:05.149
BE REJECTED THE FIRST YEAR SAY

00:43:05.215 --> 00:43:07.418
COME BACK WITH THE SPECIFICS

00:43:07.484 --> 00:43:09.086
WE'LL GET IT ROLLING THEY NEVER

00:43:09.153 --> 00:43:11.422
DID THAT SO I WILL NOT BE ABLE

00:43:11.488 --> 00:43:13.023
TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY.

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:15.292
AND CERTAINLY I AM VERY VERY

00:43:15.359 --> 00:43:17.127
CONCERNED WITH US SAFETY WE HAD

00:43:17.194 --> 00:43:19.496
TERRIBLE FIRES AN ORANGE COUNTY

00:43:19.563 --> 00:43:21.165
WE HAVE A REVERSE NINE ONE ONE

00:43:21.231 --> 00:43:21.799
SYSTEM.

00:43:21.865 --> 00:43:23.000
THAT ARE COUNTY IMPLEMENTED AND

00:43:23.067 --> 00:43:24.735
IT WORKS VERY WELL PERHAPS

00:43:24.802 --> 00:43:26.737
THAT'S THE ANSWER IN THE SHORT

00:43:26.804 --> 00:43:27.671
TERM AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT.

00:43:27.738 --> 00:43:29.039
BUT IN THE LONG TERM WE NEED

00:43:29.106 --> 00:43:32.176
BETTER ANSWERS ON THIS WE NEED A

00:43:32.242 --> 00:43:33.610
SYSTEM THAT SAW A LITTLE LIKE.

00:43:33.677 --> 00:43:35.446
CLASSE AND I'M NOT SURE THIS IS

00:43:35.512 --> 00:43:36.447
GOING TO GET US THERE SO TODAY I

00:43:36.513 --> 00:43:37.915
WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT

00:43:37.982 --> 00:43:39.216
THIS THANK YOU.

00:43:39.283 --> 00:43:44.688
THANK YOU SENATOR BATES SENATOR

00:43:44.755 --> 00:43:46.290
GROVE.

00:43:46.357 --> 00:43:48.292
THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT.

00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:48.892
I TO JOIN MY COLLEGE FOR MY

00:43:48.959 --> 00:43:49.560
COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY TO

00:43:49.626 --> 00:43:50.160
RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL

00:43:50.227 --> 00:43:51.295
AND I KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:43:51.362 --> 00:43:52.830
EMOTIONS AROUND THIS PARTICULAR

00:43:52.896 --> 00:43:54.598
PIECE OF LEGISLATION BECAUSE

00:43:54.665 --> 00:43:56.333
THERE WERE LIVES LOST.

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.601
IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIAIN THE

00:43:57.668 --> 00:44:00.037
CITY OF BE BURKE AND ALSO WHERE --

00:44:00.104 --> 00:44:02.106
IN CITY SANTA BARBARA WHERE MY

00:44:02.172 --> 00:44:03.107
OTHER COLLEAGUES SPOKE ABOUT

00:44:03.173 --> 00:44:03.907
THIS.

00:44:03.974 --> 00:44:05.642
IN -- SKIN THE YEARS CAN FIRE IN

00:44:05.709 --> 00:44:08.312
MY DISTRICT WE HAD LIVES LOST --

00:44:08.379 --> 00:44:10.014
SO I KNOW IT IS VERY IMPORTANT I

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:11.448
DO AGREE AND I THINK WE ALL

00:44:11.515 --> 00:44:13.283
AGREE THAT IT'S AN ANTIQUATED

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:14.651
SYSTEM IN THAT IT NEEDS TO BE.

00:44:14.718 --> 00:44:17.454
IMPROVED AND IT NEEDS TO BE.

00:44:17.521 --> 00:44:19.023
DEVELOPED INTO A SYSTEM THAT

00:44:19.089 --> 00:44:20.424
BENEFITS OUR CONSTITUENTS AND

00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:22.593
PROVIDES OF A HIGHER QUALITY OF

00:44:22.659 --> 00:44:24.361
SAFETY FOR CONSTITUENTS.

00:44:24.428 --> 00:44:24.995
BUT YOU KNOW COLLEAGUES WE HAVE

00:44:25.062 --> 00:44:26.930
A TWENTY TWO BILLION TWENTY TWO

00:44:26.997 --> 00:44:29.533
BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS -- THAT

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.235
CAN EASILY PAY FOR THIS AND I

00:44:31.301 --> 00:44:32.870
THINK THAT THE ISSUE WAS THE

00:44:32.936 --> 00:44:33.370
PAYMENT.

00:44:33.437 --> 00:44:35.172
AND I THINK WHAT FRUSTRATES ME

00:44:35.239 --> 00:44:36.240
THE MOST IS THAT WE TAKE AN

00:44:36.306 --> 00:44:37.674
EMOTIONAL ISSUE WHETHER IT'S

00:44:37.741 --> 00:44:38.909
THIS ISSUE THE DEVELOPMENT OF

00:44:38.976 --> 00:44:40.778
STABILITY COMMUNITY WHATEVER THE

00:44:40.844 --> 00:44:41.979
ISSUE IS.

00:44:42.046 --> 00:44:44.515
IF IT'S A AN EMOTIONAL ISSUE

00:44:44.581 --> 00:44:45.949
THEY THREW A TAX INCREASE OUR

00:44:46.016 --> 00:44:48.452
TAX INCREASES ALWAYS PROPOSED ON

00:44:48.519 --> 00:44:49.853
ONE OF THESE TYPES OF ISSUES

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.355
WHEN WE HAVE THE RESOURCES

00:44:51.422 --> 00:44:53.090
WITHOUT IMPOSING ADDITIONAL

00:44:53.157 --> 00:44:54.024
TAXES.

00:44:54.091 --> 00:44:57.728
ON CALIFORNIANS TO BE ABLE TO

00:44:57.795 --> 00:44:59.730
PAY FOR THIS STRUCTURE.

00:44:59.797 --> 00:45:00.931
MY COLLEAGUE HAS MENTIONED

00:45:00.998 --> 00:45:01.532
EARLIER IT WAS MENTIONED IN

00:45:01.598 --> 00:45:02.366
ANOTHER IECE OF LEGISLATION A

00:45:02.433 --> 00:45:04.201
COUPLE OF DAYS AGO THAT 53% OF

00:45:04.268 --> 00:45:05.702
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BELIEVES

00:45:05.769 --> 00:45:06.703
THAT IT'S NOT AFFORDABLE TO

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:07.304
LEAVE HERE.

00:45:07.371 --> 00:45:09.206
IF YOU TAKE THAT TO MILLENNIALS

00:45:09.273 --> 00:45:11.341
AT 63% OF THE STATE CONTINUING

00:45:11.408 --> 00:45:13.644
TO INCREASE TAXES DOES NOT MAKE

00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:15.212
IT MORE AFFORDABLE TO LIVE HERE.

00:45:15.279 --> 00:45:16.713
AND I SAW SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:19.283
IT'S JUST EIGHTY CENTS BUT WHEN

00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:21.051
YOU ADD EIGHTY CENTS ON TOP OF

00:45:21.118 --> 00:45:23.220
ADDITIONAL GAS TAX INCREASES

00:45:23.287 --> 00:45:24.288
THAT CONTINUALLY RISE IN THE

00:45:24.354 --> 00:45:25.489
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:45:25.556 --> 00:45:27.191
THERE'S OTHER WAYS TO MAKE SURE

00:45:27.257 --> 00:45:28.759
THAT WE CAN PROVIDE SAFETY AND

00:45:28.826 --> 00:45:31.128
SERVICES TO OUR CONSTITUENTS SO

00:45:31.195 --> 00:45:34.398
THAT WE HAVE AN UPDATED. NINE

00:45:34.465 --> 00:45:35.833
ONE ONE SYSTEM THAT WORKS

00:45:35.899 --> 00:45:36.900
WHETHER YOU LIVE IN A RURAL

00:45:36.967 --> 00:45:38.769
COMMUNITY OR YOU LIVE IN

00:45:38.836 --> 00:45:40.237
DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES.

00:45:40.304 --> 00:45:42.473
BUT THE IDEA TO INCREASE TAXES

00:45:42.539 --> 00:45:43.740
ON THE ENTIRE STATE OF

00:45:43.807 --> 00:45:45.075
CALIFORNIA AGAIN.

00:45:45.142 --> 00:45:48.245
AND WHEN WE HAVE THE RESOURCES

00:45:48.312 --> 00:45:50.314
IN AS IN AS IN AS FAR AS A SLUSH

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:52.149
FUND BUT IN A RESERVE FOR TWENTY

00:45:52.216 --> 00:45:53.283
TWO BILLION DOLLARS.

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:54.618
IN THE BUDGET BILL THAT WE

00:45:54.685 --> 00:45:55.853
PASSED ON THURSDAY PASSED OUT

00:45:55.919 --> 00:45:57.554
ALMOST THREE HUNDRED MILLION

00:45:57.621 --> 00:45:59.590
DOLLARS IN PET PROJECTS. TO A

00:45:59.656 --> 00:46:01.058
LOT INDIVIDUALS DISTRICTS IT'S

00:46:01.125 --> 00:46:02.426
JUST NOT THE WAY THAT WE AGREE

00:46:02.493 --> 00:46:05.963
TO FINANCING SO THE OPPOSITION

00:46:06.029 --> 00:46:06.964
IS NOT ABOUT.

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:08.365
THE OPPOSITION IS NOT ABOUT

00:46:08.432 --> 00:46:09.299
HAVING A NINE ONE SYSTEM NINE

00:46:09.366 --> 00:46:10.701
ONE ONE SYSTEM THAT WORKS THE

00:46:10.767 --> 00:46:12.936
OPPOSITION IS ABOUT THE PAYMENT

00:46:13.003 --> 00:46:15.305
AND HOW RESOURCES ARE REQUIRED

00:46:15.372 --> 00:46:17.708
TO PAY FOR THIS SYSTEM.

00:46:17.774 --> 00:46:21.145
SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE A NO VOTE

00:46:21.211 --> 00:46:21.445
[inaudible]

00:46:21.512 --> 00:46:23.814
SENATOR NIELSEN.

00:46:23.881 --> 00:46:25.182
MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES AND

00:46:25.249 --> 00:46:28.385
GENTLEMEN THE SENATE I RISE IN

00:46:28.452 --> 00:46:30.888
SUPPORT BUT WITH A STRONG

00:46:30.954 --> 00:46:31.989
MEASURE OF FRUSTRATION.

00:46:32.055 --> 00:46:35.259
OVER THIS ISSUE.

00:46:35.325 --> 00:46:37.761
I STOOD AGAINST IT LAST YEAR.

00:46:37.828 --> 00:46:40.230
THEN RIGHTEOUS GOOD CONSCIENCE.

00:46:40.297 --> 00:46:41.298
SOME OF THE SAME REASONS MY

00:46:41.365 --> 00:46:44.968
ORANGE COUNTY CALLING JUST SPOKE.

00:46:45.035 --> 00:46:47.437
LIKE MOST AGENCIES WHO COME TO

00:46:47.504 --> 00:46:49.306
THE LEGISLATURE FOR MONEY.

00:46:49.373 --> 00:46:51.742
THEY DON'T HAVE A PLAN.

00:46:51.808 --> 00:46:54.011
THEY EXPECT US TO JUST INVEST IN

00:46:54.077 --> 00:46:56.480
THEIR IDEA.

00:46:56.547 --> 00:46:58.682
MAYBE IN EFFECT GIVING THEM.

00:46:58.749 --> 00:47:01.552
A BLANK CHECK.

00:47:01.618 --> 00:47:03.854
OVER THESE MANY MANY MONTHS I'VE.

00:47:03.921 --> 00:47:05.122
ADMONISHED [inaudible]

00:47:05.189 --> 00:47:06.256
AND REQUESTED [inaudible]

00:47:06.323 --> 00:47:09.560
THE PLAN.

00:47:09.626 --> 00:47:12.196
WELL FINALLY JUST THE OTHER DAY.

00:47:12.262 --> 00:47:13.697
I GOT A VERBAL OUTLINE OF THE

00:47:13.764 --> 00:47:16.633
PLAN.

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:18.168
NOT A DOCUMENT BETTER OF VERBAL

00:47:18.235 --> 00:47:18.969
OUTLINE.

00:47:19.036 --> 00:47:22.039
OF A PLAN.

00:47:22.105 --> 00:47:23.473
THAT'S UNSATISFACTORY AND IS

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:26.476
TYPICAL OF THE ON RESPONSIVENESS

00:47:26.543 --> 00:47:29.313
OF GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES.

00:47:29.379 --> 00:47:32.416
I HAVE TO WEIGH THAT THOUGH.

00:47:32.482 --> 00:47:33.750
AGAINST THE NEED THAT WE HAVE

00:47:33.817 --> 00:47:37.321
HERE.

00:47:37.387 --> 00:47:37.854
THEN THIS IS UP FRONT AND

00:47:37.921 --> 00:47:41.692
PERSONAL [inaudible] FOR FOLKS.

00:47:41.758 --> 00:47:42.292
WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT

00:47:42.359 --> 00:47:44.995
FIRE.

00:47:45.062 --> 00:47:46.763
I'M IN THE MIDDLE.

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:49.800
OF THE FIRE.

00:47:49.866 --> 00:47:51.268
THE KNOW HUNDREDS WHO LOST THEIR

00:47:51.335 --> 00:47:52.436
HOMES AND THEY'VE BEEN WORKING

00:47:52.502 --> 00:47:54.905
EVER SINCE. TO ASSIST THE

00:47:54.972 --> 00:47:57.307
COMMUNITIES PEARL. TO DIG OUT OF

00:47:57.374 --> 00:48:00.844
THIS MESS.

00:48:00.911 --> 00:48:01.578
ALSO.

00:48:01.645 --> 00:48:05.782
I WAS A PART OF THE OROVILLE.

00:48:05.849 --> 00:48:07.484
STILL WAY FAILURE AND I REMEMBER

00:48:07.551 --> 00:48:08.752
VIVIDLY TALKING TO THE SHERIFF

00:48:08.819 --> 00:48:10.220
ELEVEN O'CLOCK THAT NIGHT AS

00:48:10.287 --> 00:48:11.655
THEY WERE ANTICIPATING THE SPILL

00:48:11.722 --> 00:48:13.323
WAY FAILURE.

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:15.826
FEELING THE WEIGHT.

00:48:15.892 --> 00:48:17.894
OF CEREMONIES BURDEN BECAUSE HE

00:48:17.961 --> 00:48:19.896
SAID CHEN D. W. R. [inaudible]

00:48:19.963 --> 00:48:22.299
ANOTHER AGENCY.

00:48:22.366 --> 00:48:24.835
BUT SOMETIMES FAILS.

00:48:24.901 --> 00:48:25.902
WE'RE NOT GIVING HIM CLEAR

00:48:25.969 --> 00:48:28.405
SIGNALS OF THE NEEDS. FOR THE

00:48:28.472 --> 00:48:30.340
IMMINENCE OF A BREAK.

00:48:30.407 --> 00:48:32.943
I'M NOT SURE WHAT TO DO.

00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:34.511
I SAID CORY HERE'S WHAT YOU DO

00:48:34.578 --> 00:48:36.246
YOU DO WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT I

00:48:36.313 --> 00:48:37.781
WILL NOT BE BEHIND YOU I WILL

00:48:37.848 --> 00:48:39.650
NOT BE DECIDE YOU I'LL BE IN

00:48:39.716 --> 00:48:40.651
FRONT OF YOU.

00:48:40.717 --> 00:48:42.619
RUN INTERFERENCE.

00:48:42.686 --> 00:48:44.388
AND HE MADE HIS DECISION A

00:48:44.454 --> 00:48:44.888
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT

00:48:44.955 --> 00:48:46.790
THOUSAND PEOPLE [inaudible]

00:48:46.857 --> 00:48:48.558
WERE EVACUATED.

00:48:48.625 --> 00:48:50.127
AND YOU KNOW THE NINE ONE ONE

00:48:50.193 --> 00:48:53.363
WAS A PART OF THAT.

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:55.766
THE COUPLE YEARS PRIOR.

00:48:55.832 --> 00:48:58.268
IRONICALLY I WAS IN [inaudible]

00:48:58.335 --> 00:48:59.670
CHICO.

00:48:59.736 --> 00:49:01.471
AT A DINNER.

00:49:01.538 --> 00:49:03.940
HONORING THE NINE ONE ONE OFFERS

00:49:04.007 --> 00:49:07.644
OF RESPONDENTS [inaudible]

00:49:07.711 --> 00:49:11.248
THE DISPATCHERS.

00:49:11.315 --> 00:49:13.583
AND AS I ARRIVED IT WAS A KIND

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:16.386
OF A SPARSE CROWD IN THE DEPUTY

00:49:16.453 --> 00:49:17.287
SHERIFF CAME UP THAT CENTER

00:49:17.354 --> 00:49:19.089
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A NOT MUCH

00:49:19.156 --> 00:49:22.259
OF AN AUDIENCE HERE TONIGHT.

00:49:22.326 --> 00:49:24.261
THERE'S BEEN A ACCIDENT ON I.

00:49:24.328 --> 00:49:25.762
FIVE FOURTEEN CARS INVOLVED.

00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:27.230
NOW THIS ACTION IT WAS ABOUT

00:49:27.297 --> 00:49:29.299
FIVE MILES FROM A RANGE.

00:49:29.366 --> 00:49:30.500
SO I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE

00:49:30.567 --> 00:49:33.203
AREA.

00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:35.372
THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE

00:49:35.439 --> 00:49:36.973
HONORED BY US THAT NIGHT.

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:39.609
HAD TO DEPART. TO DO THEIR

00:49:39.676 --> 00:49:41.545
DUTIES.

00:49:41.611 --> 00:49:43.980
THAT'S QUITE A MESS.

00:49:44.047 --> 00:49:47.384
LIVES WERE LOST.

00:49:47.451 --> 00:49:47.984
WE HAD ANOTHER INCIDENT IN THE

00:49:48.051 --> 00:49:49.886
SCHOOL.

00:49:49.953 --> 00:49:52.522
ABOUT TEN MILES FROM OUR PLACE

00:49:52.589 --> 00:49:52.823
[inaudible]

00:49:52.889 --> 00:49:55.192
THE SHOOTER.

00:49:55.258 --> 00:49:56.159
AND THERE'S NO CELL.

00:49:56.226 --> 00:49:57.527
ACCESS [inaudible]

00:49:57.594 --> 00:49:59.162
AFTER.

00:49:59.229 --> 00:50:00.831
WE WORK CHANCE TO ACCOMPLISH

00:50:00.897 --> 00:50:02.499
SOME FOR THEM.

00:50:02.566 --> 00:50:04.868
BUT THE POINT I MAKE.

00:50:04.935 --> 00:50:06.103
AS WE REACH A DECISION HERE

00:50:06.169 --> 00:50:07.971
TODAY.

00:50:08.038 --> 00:50:10.640
THE YEARS HAVE PASSED.

00:50:10.707 --> 00:50:11.975
THOUGH I AM NOT ALTOGETHER

00:50:12.042 --> 00:50:13.877
COMFORTABLE AND HAPPY.

00:50:13.944 --> 00:50:14.945
WITH THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE THAT

00:50:15.011 --> 00:50:16.913
WE HAVE BEEN PRESENTED WITH WHAT

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:19.216
WE ARE QUOTE BUYING INTO.

00:50:19.282 --> 00:50:20.083
AND BY THE WAY THAT'S FLAVORED

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:21.952
BY THESE.

00:50:22.018 --> 00:50:24.221
BILLION DOLLAR TECH PROJECTS

00:50:24.287 --> 00:50:26.022
THAT THE STATE HAS INVESTED IN

00:50:26.089 --> 00:50:27.257
FOR DECADES THAT HAVE.

00:50:27.324 --> 00:50:29.226
GONE AWRY.

00:50:29.292 --> 00:50:31.728
COST IS BILLIONS IN OVER RUNS.

00:50:31.795 --> 00:50:34.731
AND NOT BEEN DONE ON TIME.

00:50:34.798 --> 00:50:36.433
AND I THINK WE'VE BEEN ADVANTAGE

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:37.033
BY PROVIDERS.

00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:38.969
IN THIS.

00:50:39.035 --> 00:50:40.737
SCENARIO OVER THE YEARS.

00:50:40.804 --> 00:50:42.939
COSTING TAXPAYERS A LOT MORE.

00:50:43.006 --> 00:50:44.541
THAN IT SHOULD AND WE HAVE NOT

00:50:44.608 --> 00:50:47.477
HAD GOOD OVERSIGHT THE AGENCIES

00:50:47.544 --> 00:50:50.480
IN CHARGE OF OVERSIGHT.

00:50:50.547 --> 00:50:52.282
NOW I THINK IT'S CALLED DO IT.

00:50:52.349 --> 00:50:54.851
HAVE NOT DONE THE JOB.

00:50:54.918 --> 00:50:56.386
BUT THAT BEGS THE ISSUE OF WHERE

00:50:56.453 --> 00:50:58.522
WE'RE AT THIS MOMENT

00:50:58.588 --> 00:50:58.822
[inaudible]

00:50:58.889 --> 00:51:00.557
THIS MOMENT.

00:51:00.624 --> 00:51:02.993
THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US

00:51:03.059 --> 00:51:04.694
TO UPGRADE THE SYSTEM I WISH I

00:51:04.761 --> 00:51:06.029
KNEW EXACTLY HOW AND MORE ABOUT

00:51:06.096 --> 00:51:07.764
IT.

00:51:07.831 --> 00:51:10.000
UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T.

00:51:10.066 --> 00:51:11.568
BUT AS LONG AS I'M PRIVILEGE TO

00:51:11.635 --> 00:51:13.570
SERVE ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE

00:51:13.637 --> 00:51:15.238
AND AS VICE CHAIRMAN.

00:51:15.305 --> 00:51:17.474
I WILL GUARANTEE THAT I WILL BE

00:51:17.541 --> 00:51:19.910
A CONSCIENCE WATCHING OVER THIS

00:51:19.976 --> 00:51:22.112
[inaudible] TO ENSURING.

00:51:22.179 --> 00:51:24.281
THAT IT IS IMPLEMENTED FULLY

00:51:24.347 --> 00:51:24.581
[inaudible]

00:51:24.648 --> 00:51:26.216
ON TIME.

00:51:26.283 --> 00:51:28.685
THEN ON BUDGET.

00:51:28.752 --> 00:51:31.087
THIS IS TRULY A CRITICAL ISSUE

00:51:31.154 --> 00:51:33.590
THIS IS A LIFE AND DEATH ISSUE

00:51:33.657 --> 00:51:35.459
THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN MANY

00:51:35.525 --> 00:51:36.560
OTHER ISSUES WE WILL EVER

00:51:36.626 --> 00:51:38.762
CONSIDER.

00:51:38.829 --> 00:51:44.367
TODAY I URGE AN AYE VOTE

00:51:44.434 --> 00:51:44.668
[inaudible]

00:51:44.734 --> 00:51:47.971
SENATOR BORCHERS.

00:51:48.038 --> 00:51:49.372
RESIDENT -- I WASN'T PLANNING ON

00:51:49.439 --> 00:51:52.075
SPEAKING ON THIS ISSUE I THINK

00:51:52.142 --> 00:51:53.710
YOU CAN CAN TELL MY COLLEAGUES

00:51:53.777 --> 00:51:55.278
CAN TELL THERE'S A SPLIT.

00:51:55.345 --> 00:51:57.180
AMONG SOME OF US.

00:51:57.247 --> 00:51:57.981
BOB BUT I BELIEVE THERE'S A

00:51:58.048 --> 00:51:59.149
FALSE CHOICE THAT HAS BEEN

00:51:59.216 --> 00:52:01.418
DEVELOPED HERE.

00:52:01.485 --> 00:52:03.787
THAT YOU EITHER CREATE THE TAX

00:52:03.854 --> 00:52:06.056
TO SAVE LIVES OR YOU DON'T IN

00:52:06.122 --> 00:52:07.624
LIVES WILL BE LOST.

00:52:07.691 --> 00:52:10.727
THAT IS NOT ACCURATE IN MY IN MY

00:52:10.794 --> 00:52:11.795
OPINION AND I BY THE WAY I

00:52:11.862 --> 00:52:12.896
REPRESENT.

00:52:12.963 --> 00:52:14.197
A LOT OF FOOT HILL MOUNTAIN

00:52:14.264 --> 00:52:15.932
COMMUNITIES IN MY DISTRICT THIS

00:52:15.999 --> 00:52:17.133
IS A CUTE LY.

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:19.202
OF CONCERN TO THE FOLKS I

00:52:19.269 --> 00:52:22.572
REPRESENT -- IN THOSE BEYOND.

00:52:22.639 --> 00:52:24.174
WHEN WE HAVE A TWENTY TWO

00:52:24.241 --> 00:52:26.276
BILLION DOLLAR RESERVE?

00:52:26.343 --> 00:52:28.478
AND IF OF BUDGET REFLECTS OUR

00:52:28.545 --> 00:52:29.846
PRIORITIES.

00:52:29.913 --> 00:52:32.382
THEN IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US TO

00:52:32.449 --> 00:52:33.817
ALLOW THAT BUDGET TO REFLECT OUR

00:52:33.884 --> 00:52:36.219
PRIORITIES IN THIS CERTAINLY IS

00:52:36.286 --> 00:52:37.087
ONE OF THEM.

00:52:37.153 --> 00:52:40.023
AND IT SHOULD BE A GENERAL FUND

00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:41.958
APPROPRIATION TO FUND THIS

00:52:42.025 --> 00:52:45.729
WORTHY CAUSE -- WE HEARD -- OF

00:52:45.795 --> 00:52:48.265
FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM US A

00:52:48.331 --> 00:52:49.266
SANTA BARBARA WHO POSE THE

00:52:49.332 --> 00:52:52.569
QUESTION WHAT IS A LIFE WORTH.

00:52:52.636 --> 00:52:54.538
WELL I BELIEVE THAT.

00:52:54.604 --> 00:52:56.306
ALL LIVES ARE WORTHY AND THEY

00:52:56.373 --> 00:52:59.009
SHOULD BE -- PROTECTED THROUGH

00:52:59.075 --> 00:53:01.177
GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION FOR

00:53:01.244 --> 00:53:03.747
THE AMOUNT OF WHATEVER IS NEEDED.

00:53:03.813 --> 00:53:05.682
BUT THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE THIS

00:53:05.749 --> 00:53:07.717
RESERVE WITH THIS SURPLUS UNDER

00:53:07.784 --> 00:53:09.286
THESE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES AND

00:53:09.352 --> 00:53:11.588
HAVE THE WHERE WITH ALL TO MAKE

00:53:11.655 --> 00:53:13.924
OUR INVESTMENT LIKE THIS.

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:15.559
I BELIEVE WE SHOULD.

00:53:15.625 --> 00:53:17.494
AND THERE'S NO JUSTIFICATION FOR

00:53:17.561 --> 00:53:19.262
DOING SO OUTSIDE OF THAT

00:53:19.329 --> 00:53:21.631
APPROPRIATION PROCESS TAX NOT

00:53:21.698 --> 00:53:22.065
NECESSARY UNDER THE

00:53:22.132 --> 00:53:24.167
CIRCUMSTACES BUT THE NEED IS

00:53:24.234 --> 00:53:25.535
COMPELLING.

00:53:25.602 --> 00:53:27.237
IMMEDIATE AND NOW.

00:53:27.304 --> 00:53:28.939
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE

00:53:29.005 --> 00:53:30.340
AREN'T -- TAPPING INTO THE

00:53:30.407 --> 00:53:31.708
RESERVE TO FUND THIS WORTHWHILE

00:53:31.775 --> 00:53:35.078
PROGRAM.

00:53:35.145 --> 00:53:37.581
ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION

00:53:37.647 --> 00:53:39.649
SEEING AND HEARING NONE SENATOR

00:53:39.716 --> 00:53:41.117
MITCHELL YOU MAY CLOSE.

00:53:41.184 --> 00:53:44.220
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR.

00:53:44.287 --> 00:53:45.622
YOU KNOW COLLEAGUES AS WE GO

00:53:45.689 --> 00:53:47.958
THROUGH THE BUDGET BE ILL.

00:53:48.024 --> 00:53:49.593
BUDGET BILL JUNIOR THE VERY

00:53:49.659 --> 00:53:50.994
FIRST TRAILER BILLS THERE ARE

00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:54.164
SOME ASPECTS OF THE BUDGET

00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:56.132
DEVELOPMENT MAKING PROCESS THAT

00:53:56.199 --> 00:53:58.401
ARE VERY COMPLEX THAT ARE MULTI

00:53:58.468 --> 00:53:59.402
LAYERED.

00:53:59.469 --> 00:54:00.503
THAT TAKE US ALL A MINUTE TO

00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:02.739
WRAP OUR MINDS AROUND THE WE

00:54:02.806 --> 00:54:04.874
RELY ON STAFF AND FINANCE AND

00:54:04.941 --> 00:54:07.377
ELLIE EL. TO PROVIDE A SUPPORT

00:54:07.444 --> 00:54:08.411
AND GUIDANCE.

00:54:08.478 --> 00:54:10.680
COLLEAGUES I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

00:54:10.747 --> 00:54:11.548
THIS ISN'T ONE OF THEM.

00:54:11.615 --> 00:54:17.654
THIS IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE.

00:54:17.721 --> 00:54:20.724
THERE IS NO STATE IN THE UNION.

00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:22.525
THAT PAYS FOR THEIR NINE ONE ONE

00:54:22.592 --> 00:54:23.760
EMERGENCY SERVICES OUT OF

00:54:23.827 --> 00:54:25.328
GENERAL FUND.

00:54:25.395 --> 00:54:27.263
NOT.

00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:29.733
ONE AND THEIR REASONS FOR THAT.

00:54:29.799 --> 00:54:30.800
YOU ALL KNOW WILL BE HERE FOR A

00:54:30.867 --> 00:54:31.835
NUMBER OF YEARS THAT ARE GENERAL

00:54:31.901 --> 00:54:34.571
FUND.

00:54:34.638 --> 00:54:36.873
ALL THIS IS.

00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:37.974
VERY FROM YEAR TO YEAR.

00:54:38.041 --> 00:54:38.642
THIS YEAR WE HAVE THE PLEASURE

00:54:38.708 --> 00:54:40.110
OF HAVING A TWENTY ONE BILLION

00:54:40.176 --> 00:54:42.012
DOLLAR RESERVE.

00:54:42.078 --> 00:54:42.946
AND FOR SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES

00:54:43.013 --> 00:54:44.481
WHO ARE NOW SUGGESTING WE USE

00:54:44.547 --> 00:54:46.349
THAT TO PAY FOR THIS.

00:54:46.416 --> 00:54:47.717
IN BUDGET HEARING AS RECENT AS

00:54:47.784 --> 00:54:49.919
YESTERDAY THE CLAIM WAS WE HAD

00:54:49.986 --> 00:54:51.354
SAVED ENOUGH THE ONE THAT I'M

00:54:51.421 --> 00:54:55.058
CONFUSED.

00:54:55.125 --> 00:54:56.826
AND THERE ARE YEARS JUST THE

00:54:56.893 --> 00:54:57.694
NINE YEARS I'VE SERVED IN THE

00:54:57.761 --> 00:54:59.229
LEGISLATURE WE HAVE HUGE

00:54:59.295 --> 00:55:01.164
DEFICITS.

00:55:01.231 --> 00:55:03.066
THAT'S ONE VERY FOUNDATIONAL

00:55:03.133 --> 00:55:05.602
BASIC REASON WHY NOT A SINGLE

00:55:05.669 --> 00:55:07.404
STATE IN THE UNION USES THEIR

00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:09.906
GENERAL FUND TO PAY FOR THEIR

00:55:09.973 --> 00:55:12.008
NINE ONE ONE EMERGENCY SERVICES.

00:55:12.075 --> 00:55:16.112
THIS IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE.

00:55:16.179 --> 00:55:18.148
WHEN WILL IT BE COMPLETED WELL

00:55:18.214 --> 00:55:19.983
COLLEAGUES I REMEMBER VERY

00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:22.786
CLEARLY STANDING ON THIS FLOOR?

00:55:22.852 --> 00:55:24.754
VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE OUTCOME

00:55:24.821 --> 00:55:26.823
OF THAT DECISION A YEAR AGO OR

00:55:26.890 --> 00:55:28.158
WE COULDN'T GET IT DONE.

00:55:28.224 --> 00:55:29.592
SO I WOULD SUGGEST IF WE CAN'T

00:55:29.659 --> 00:55:31.494
GET IT DONE AGAIN THIS YEAR.

00:55:31.561 --> 00:55:32.662
THERE IS NO PROJECTION WHEN WE

00:55:32.729 --> 00:55:35.732
WILL GET A COMPLETED.

00:55:35.799 --> 00:55:37.467
YOU KNOW COLLEAGUES IT NEVER

00:55:37.534 --> 00:55:38.802
OCCURS TO ANY OF OUR

00:55:38.868 --> 00:55:41.738
CONSTITUENTS WERE EVER WE LIVE.

00:55:41.805 --> 00:55:44.441
IN A FIRE PRONE AREA OR NOT IT

00:55:44.507 --> 00:55:47.310
NEVER OCCURS TO A SINGLE

00:55:47.377 --> 00:55:49.713
CALIFORNIA RESIDENT.

00:55:49.779 --> 00:55:50.346
AND YOU COULD TAKE THIS TO THE

00:55:50.413 --> 00:55:51.147
BANK.

00:55:51.214 --> 00:55:52.415
THAT WHEN THEY PICK UP THEIR

00:55:52.482 --> 00:55:55.819
PHONE AND CALL 911- THAT THERE

00:55:55.885 --> 00:55:57.153
IS A CHANCE THAT IT MIGHT NOT

00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:59.589
WORK.

00:55:59.656 --> 00:56:02.092
IT NEVER OCCURS TO ANY

00:56:02.158 --> 00:56:04.961
CALIFORNIA RESIDENT.

00:56:05.028 --> 00:56:05.795
AND WHEN YOU HAVE HAD THE

00:56:05.862 --> 00:56:07.597
OCCASION TO PICK UP THE PHONE

00:56:07.664 --> 00:56:10.500
AND DIAL 911- IT'S BECAUSE YOU

00:56:10.567 --> 00:56:13.603
ARE IN TROUBLE.

00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:18.208
AND YOU NEED HELP.

00:56:18.274 --> 00:56:19.843
AND IF WE'RE GOING TO SIT HERE

00:56:19.909 --> 00:56:20.543
ON THIS FLOOR.

00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:23.513

01:24:24.159 --> 01:24:25.660
PROTECTING THE RESERVES WE NEED

01:24:25.727 --> 01:24:26.428
TO WRITE OUT A DOWNTURN SO WE

01:24:26.494 --> 01:24:28.496
DON'T SEE A SITUATION WHERE WE

01:24:28.563 --> 01:24:30.565
FIND AND THEN WE LITERALLY RUN

01:24:30.632 --> 01:24:32.267
OUT OF MONEY AND THEN WE COULD.

01:34:33.968 --> 01:34:37.872
DIVERSITY OF SERVICES.

01:34:37.938 --> 01:34:38.773
I WANT TO PROVIDE ONE POINT OF

01:34:38.839 --> 01:34:41.175
CLARIFICATION.

01:34:41.242 --> 01:34:43.811
WE'VE NOT MADE ANY REDUCTIONS

01:34:43.878 --> 01:34:45.212

SERVICES.

01:34:47.848 --> 01:34:49.917
THIS TRAILER BILL REFLECTS

01:34:49.984 --> 01:34:51.419
AUGMENTATIONS THAT WE WERE ABLE

01:34:51.485 --> 01:34:53.054

AND SO WHILE WE FULLY UNDERSTAND

01:34:55.523 --> 01:34:56.424

pTHE SERVICES.

01:35:00.528 --> 01:35:01.629
BECAUSE THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE

01:35:01.695 --> 01:35:02.763
IS SO LOW.

01:35:02.830 --> 01:35:04.698
THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS.

01:35:04.765 --> 01:35:07.201
TRAILER BILL THAT WILL ELIMINATE

01:35:07.268 --> 01:35:09.103

DONE TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL.

01:35:13.607 --> 01:35:15.576
BOATS RICE BUT THERE'S NOTHING

01:35:15.643 --> 01:35:17.812
IN THIS TRAILER BILL THAT

01:35:17.878 --> 01:35:19.246
ELIMINATES A SERVICE.

01:35:19.313 --> 01:35:21.082
THERE WAS ELOQUENT TESTIMONY IN

01:35:21.148 --> 01:35:23.684
THE BUDGET COMMITTEE YESTERDAY.

01:35:23.751 --> 01:35:25.119
IT REMINDED ME OF THE TOUGH

01:35:25.186 --> 01:35:27.154
VOTES AND DECISIONS WE HAD TO

01:35:27.221 --> 01:35:28.756
MAKE A WE ELIMINATE WE DID

01:35:28.823 --> 01:35:30.291

01:35:31.125 --> 01:35:34.361
WHICH PREVENT IT THE STATE'S

01:35:34.428 --> 01:35:35.629
ABILITY TO FUND.

01:35:35.696 --> 01:35:38.732
EARLY INTERVENTION.

01:35:38.799 --> 01:35:40.401
AND EARLY DIAGNOSIS FOR MANY DE

01:35:40.468 --> 01:35:42.103

01:35:42.169 --> 01:35:44.538
ISSUES.

01:35:44.605 --> 01:35:46.807
CHILDREN ON THE SPECTRUM.

01:35:46.874 --> 01:35:48.409
WE WERE ABLE TO REFUND THAT

01:35:48.476 --> 01:35:50.611
PROGRAM A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO.

01:35:50.678 --> 01:35:51.812
AND WE WERE REMINDED THAT THIS

01:35:51.879 --> 01:35:54.181
TRAILER BILL SHOULD AND WE MUST

01:35:54.248 --> 01:35:57.518

01:35:58.552 --> 01:35:59.520
COMMUNITY.

01:35:59.587 --> 01:36:00.287

01:36:03.624 --> 01:36:04.358
THAT.

01:36:04.425 --> 01:36:05.960
BUT COLLEAGUES WE HAVE COME SO

01:36:06.026 --> 01:36:08.629
