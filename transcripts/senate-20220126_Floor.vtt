00:37:43.027 --> 00:37:45.429
LEGISLATION. THAT I'VE WORKED ON

00:37:45.496 --> 00:37:47.298

EARLIEST YEARS OF LEARNING

SPECIFICALLY SB SEVENTY WILL

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.375
REQUIRE STUDENTS TO COMPLETE ONE

00:37:57.441 --> 00:37:58.876
YEAR OF KINDERGARTEN PRIOR TO

00:37:58.943 --> 00:38:00.344
ENTERING THE FIRST GRADE OF A

00:38:00.411 --> 00:38:02.346
PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. TO BE

00:38:02.413 --> 00:38:04.515
CLEAR- WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE

00:38:04.582 --> 00:38:07.051
COMPULSORY AGE. AS AN ELEMENTARY

00:38:07.118 --> 00:38:08.686
SCHOOL TEACHER I HAVE PERSONALLY

00:38:08.753 --> 00:38:10.287
WITNESSED HOW EARLY EDUCATION

00:38:10.354 --> 00:38:12.189
CAN HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON

00:38:12.256 --> 00:38:14.458
STUDENT ACADEMIC SUCCESS. YOU

00:38:14.525 --> 00:38:16.394
CAN EASILY DISTINGUISH THE

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:17.928
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BILLS HAVE

00:38:17.995 --> 00:38:19.196
BEEN IN CANDOR AND THOSE THAT

00:38:19.263 --> 00:38:21.399
HAVE NOT. I HAVE BEEN IN A FIRST

00:38:21.465 --> 00:38:22.933
GRADE CLASSROOM WHEN I HAVE TO

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.569
STUDENTS THAT ARE THE SAME AGE

00:38:25.636 --> 00:38:27.705
HOWEVER. ONE STRUGGLES TO SIT IN

00:38:27.772 --> 00:38:29.874
A CLASSROOM SETTING DOESN'T KNOW

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.275
WHAT TO DO WITH THE PENCIL IS

00:38:31.342 --> 00:38:33.411
HOLDING THE BOOK UPSIDE DOWN

00:38:33.477 --> 00:38:34.879
BECAUSE THEY'VE NEVER HAD THAT

00:38:34.945 --> 00:38:36.414
EXPERIENCE. WELL THE OTHER

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.748
STUDENT IS ALREADY READING

00:38:37.815 --> 00:38:39.717
SECOND GRADE LEVEL THE WRITING

00:38:39.784 --> 00:38:42.019
FULL SENTENCES AND GOING EVEN

00:38:42.086 --> 00:38:43.320
FURTHER TALKING ABOUT ALL THE

00:38:43.387 --> 00:38:44.722
SCIENCE PROJECTS THAT WORKED ON

00:38:44.789 --> 00:38:46.490
DURING THE SUMMER. SO THAT

00:38:46.557 --> 00:38:48.059
DISPARITY ONLY GROWS

00:38:48.125 --> 00:38:51.495
EXPONENTIALLY AS THE CHILDREN GO

00:38:51.562 --> 00:38:52.763
UP IN GREAT LEVELS. NOW MORE

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:54.131
THAN EVER WE MUST SUPPORT OUR

00:38:54.198 --> 00:38:55.266
YOUNGEST LEARNERS BY ENSURING

00:38:55.332 --> 00:38:57.168
THAT THEY RECEIVE THOSE CRITICAL

00:38:57.234 --> 00:38:59.236
INSTRUCTION EARLY ON WHICH IS

00:38:59.303 --> 00:38:59.970
THE BUILDING BLOCKS FOR LATER

00:39:00.037 --> 00:39:02.807
YEARS. FOR STUDENTS WHO HAVE NOT

00:39:02.873 --> 00:39:03.974
BEEN ENROLLED IN KINDERGARTEN

00:39:04.041 --> 00:39:05.976
OFTENTIMES IT'S THE TEACHERS AND

00:39:06.043 --> 00:39:07.545
THE PARENTS WHO ARE SPENDING SO

00:39:07.611 --> 00:39:09.780
MUCH TIME. TRYING TO TEACH THEM

00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:11.449
THE FOUNDATIONAL SKILLS THAT

00:39:11.515 --> 00:39:12.683
THEIR OTHER PEERS HAVE ALREADY

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:14.552
MASTERED IN KINDERGARTEN.

00:39:14.618 --> 00:39:16.554
ADDITIONALLY OUR TEACHERS

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:18.989
STRUGGLE NOW MORE THAN EVER US

00:39:19.056 --> 00:39:20.858
WE KNOW AND THE BEST WAY WE CAN

00:39:20.925 --> 00:39:22.460
SUPPORT THEM IS BY HAVING

00:39:22.526 --> 00:39:25.129
STUDENTS PREPARED. IN CLASS AND

00:39:25.196 --> 00:39:26.430
AS THEY MOVE UP IN ACADEMIC RATE

00:39:26.497 --> 00:39:29.200
LEVELS AGAIN AS A TEACHER I CAN

00:39:29.266 --> 00:39:31.202
ATTEST THAT WE- OFTEN HAVE THREE

00:39:31.268 --> 00:39:33.237
TO FOUR LEVELS GOING ON IN ONE

00:39:33.304 --> 00:39:33.771
CLASSROOM. AND HAVING TWO

00:39:33.838 --> 00:39:35.473
DIFFERENT DIFFERENTIATE AND

00:39:35.539 --> 00:39:37.441
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY

00:39:37.508 --> 00:39:39.477
CHILD LEARNS IS A CHALLENGE WE

00:39:39.543 --> 00:39:41.612
DO IT WE DO IT GLADLY. BUT WE

00:39:41.679 --> 00:39:43.247
NEED TO SUPPORT OUR TEACHERS

00:39:43.314 --> 00:39:45.316
STUDENTS CANNOT AFFORD THE GAP

00:39:45.382 --> 00:39:47.218
THAT INCREASES. EXPONENTIALLY AS

00:39:47.284 --> 00:39:49.587
I STATED AND THIS IS THE TIME

00:39:49.653 --> 00:39:51.722
ACROSS THE STATE WE HAVE SEEN

00:39:51.789 --> 00:39:53.390
LARGE DROPS IN SCHOOL

00:39:53.457 --> 00:39:55.359
ENROLLMENT. AND AS WE KNOW COVE

00:39:55.426 --> 00:39:57.595

00:44:07.244 --> 00:44:09.179
DISTRICT THEY CAN DECIDE. IF

IS A STANDARDIZED ARE TESTING-

00:44:17.554 --> 00:44:19.456
SITUATION WHERE PARENTS CAN ASK

00:44:19.523 --> 00:44:20.758
THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO PROVIDE A

00:44:20.824 --> 00:44:22.726
TEST AND THE TEST. IS THEN GIVEN

00:44:22.793 --> 00:44:24.762
TO THE CHILD CORRECT AND SO

00:44:24.828 --> 00:44:26.030
THAT'S LEFT TO THE DISCRETION OF

00:44:26.096 --> 00:44:26.997

IS READY TO MOVE ON TO FIRST

00:44:32.936 --> 00:44:34.004
GRADE THANK YOU I THINK THE

00:44:34.071 --> 00:44:35.706

00:44:35.773 --> 00:44:36.807
THE OLD DAYS. KINDERGARTEN AND

EVEN PRE SCHOOL WORKING

00:44:38.675 --> 00:44:40.144
OBVIOUSLY LUXURIES THAT A LOT OF

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:42.212
KIDS DIDN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

00:44:42.279 --> 00:44:43.080
TO PARTICIPATE IN. BUT I THINK

00:44:43.147 --> 00:44:44.815
WHAT WE'VE SEEN WITH OUR TEST

00:44:44.882 --> 00:44:46.216
RESULTS IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL

00:44:46.283 --> 00:44:47.618
CHALLENGES WITH OUR CHILDREN IS

00:44:47.684 --> 00:44:49.586
THAT WE NEED MORE EMPHASIS ON

00:44:49.653 --> 00:44:51.822
EARLY EDUCATION MORE OPPORTUNITY

00:44:51.889 --> 00:44:56.126
FOR EARLY EDUCATION. THIS IS A

00:44:56.193 --> 00:44:57.761

THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I. KIND

00:44:59.229 --> 00:45:02.199

CALIFORNIA STATE STANDARDS THAT

OKAY QUESTION. THANK YOU I'M

THAT BUT- AS AS I STATED IN THE

00:53:35.946 --> 00:53:37.614
COMMITTEE IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING

00:53:37.681 --> 00:53:39.282
THAT IT'S ALREADY IN STATUTE.

00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:40.784
I'M HAVING THE ABILITY FOR THE

00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:43.853
LOCAL COUNTY. BOARD OF EDUCATION

TO CHOOSE TO CHANGE THE DATE OF

THE ELECTION. AND BEING THAT

00:53:48.725 --> 00:53:50.160
IT'S ALREADY SUCH A HAD ASKED

00:53:50.226 --> 00:53:51.027
WHETHER OR NOT IT HAD ALREADY

00:53:51.094 --> 00:53:54.297
BRING BY THAT BROUGHT UP TO. THE

00:53:54.364 --> 00:53:56.099
TO THE BOARD BY THEIR OWN

00:53:56.166 --> 00:53:58.001
CONSTITUENTS TO SEE WHETHER OR

00:53:58.068 --> 00:53:59.970
NOT IT WAS A CONCERN AND THEY

00:54:00.036 --> 00:54:00.937
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT- IT

00:54:01.004 --> 00:54:02.238
COULD BE CHANGED SO I WAS

00:54:02.305 --> 00:54:04.040
WONDERING IF YOU HAD FOLLOWED UP

00:54:04.107 --> 00:54:06.443
ON THAT AND WHETHER OR NOT IT

00:54:06.509 --> 00:54:07.143
HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP TO THE BOARD

00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:08.778
FOR LOCAL DECISION MAKING. THANK

00:54:08.845 --> 00:54:09.846
YOU FOR THE QUESTION- I

00:54:09.913 --> 00:54:11.047
APPRECIATE THAT SENATOR AND I'D

00:54:11.114 --> 00:54:13.183
SAY WE DID FOLLOW UP WE WERE NOT

00:54:13.249 --> 00:54:14.985
ABLE TO DRILL DOWN AND A 100%

00:54:15.051 --> 00:54:16.820
CERTAIN ANSWER WHICH IS WHY WE

00:54:16.886 --> 00:54:17.887
DIDN'T RESPOND- YET BUT- WHAT MY

00:54:17.954 --> 00:54:19.255
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE'S

00:54:19.322 --> 00:54:21.024
NOT BEEN A FORMAL PROPOSAL MADE

00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:22.559
TO THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF

00:54:22.626 --> 00:54:23.927
EDUCATION. BUT THERE HAVE BEEN A

00:54:23.994 --> 00:54:24.995
NUMBER OF CONSTITUENTS AND

00:54:25.061 --> 00:54:26.630
OTHERS WHO HAVE BROUGHT THIS UP

00:54:26.696 --> 00:54:28.264
TO MEMBERS INDIVIDUALLY ABOUT

00:54:28.331 --> 00:54:32.068
THE DIP IDEA OF MOVING THIS

00:54:32.135 --> 00:54:33.970
ELECTION TO. NOVEMBER SO IT IS

00:54:34.037 --> 00:54:34.871
SHORT ANSWERS I DON'T BELIEVE

00:54:34.938 --> 00:54:36.439
THERE'S BEEN A FORMAL PROPOSAL

00:54:36.506 --> 00:54:37.874
MADE BUT THERE HAVE BEEN

00:54:37.941 --> 00:54:42.178
INFORMAL ENQUIRIES. I DO HAVE A

00:54:42.245 --> 00:54:43.613
FOLLOW UP QUESTION MADAM

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:44.581
PRESIDENT YOU MAY PROCEED THANK

00:54:44.648 --> 00:54:46.816
YOU. SO IN OTHER WORDS WE HAVING

00:54:46.883 --> 00:54:53.623
GIVEN. IN STATUTE IS THAT

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:55.659
CORRECT. THAT IS CORRECT YES AND

00:54:55.725 --> 00:54:57.060
THAT BEING SAID I THINK THE

00:54:57.127 --> 00:54:59.062
GENERAL TENOR IN BELIEF BY MANY

00:54:59.129 --> 00:55:00.430
CONSTITUENTS IS THAT THIS.

00:55:00.497 --> 00:55:02.666
PARTICULAR BOARD OF EDUCATION I

00:55:02.732 --> 00:55:04.701
IS VERY PARTISAN AND IS UNLIKELY

00:55:04.768 --> 00:55:06.169
TO MOVE THAT I THINK THAT'S

00:55:06.236 --> 00:55:07.871
PROBABLY REFLECTED IN SOME OF

00:55:07.937 --> 00:55:08.905
THE PUBLIC COMMENTS THAT THEY'VE

00:55:08.972 --> 00:55:09.873
ALREADY MADE ABOUT THIS BILL.

00:55:09.939 --> 00:55:11.408
NONE OF WHICH HAVE SUBSTANCE

00:55:11.474 --> 00:55:12.709
LIAM SUBSTANTIVELY ADDRESS THAT

00:55:12.776 --> 00:55:14.978
THE IDEA OF MOVING ELECTION FROM

00:55:15.045 --> 00:55:16.079
THE PRIMARY TO THE NOVEMBER

00:55:16.146 --> 00:55:17.781
GENERAL ELECTION- BUT WHICH HAVE

00:55:17.847 --> 00:55:20.483
REALLY ENGAGE IN A LOT OF

00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:21.017
VITRIOLIC STATEMENTS IN.

00:55:21.084 --> 00:55:22.152
INCLUDING SOME ONES THAT ARE

00:55:22.218 --> 00:55:23.887
PERSONAL OFFENSIVE IN AND SO I

00:55:23.953 --> 00:55:25.255
THINK THE SENSE IS THAT THIS

00:55:25.321 --> 00:55:27.724
PARTICULAR MAKE UP OF THIS

00:55:27.791 --> 00:55:29.893
BOARD. IS NOT LIKELY TO MOVE IT.

00:55:29.959 --> 00:55:32.028
OKAY SO MY COMMENTS COMING FROM

00:55:32.095 --> 00:55:34.030
A LOCAL PERSPECTIVE AS FAR AS

00:55:34.097 --> 00:55:36.366
GOVERNMENT GOES I ALWAYS FEEL

00:55:36.433 --> 00:55:36.966
THAT THE CONSTITUENTS HAVE THE

00:55:37.033 --> 00:55:39.302
AUTHORITY TO POWER TO CHANGE THE

00:55:39.369 --> 00:55:41.137
LOCAL BOARD IF THEY'RE NOT HAPPY

00:55:41.204 --> 00:55:42.472
WITH THE DECISIONS ARE BEING

00:55:42.539 --> 00:55:45.575
MADE IN THAT DIRECTION SO- I AM

00:55:45.642 --> 00:55:47.844
VERY HESITANT TO BRING THIS TO

00:55:47.911 --> 00:55:49.779
THE STATE LEVEL TO INTRUDE ON

00:55:49.846 --> 00:55:50.880
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHEN THEY

00:55:50.947 --> 00:55:52.048
HAVEN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO

00:55:52.115 --> 00:55:53.683
ADDRESS IT LOCALLY SO I

00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:55.752
RESPECTFULLY WILL NOT BE

00:55:55.819 --> 00:55:58.054
SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY.

00:55:58.121 --> 00:56:00.857
SENATOR BRIDGES. I THINK MY

00:56:00.924 --> 00:56:04.994
COLLEAGUES- JUST SAID I THINK

00:56:05.061 --> 00:56:06.162
SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

00:56:06.229 --> 00:56:08.598
POINTS. IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO

00:56:08.665 --> 00:56:10.400
THINK THAT THIS IS A DISTRICT

00:56:10.467 --> 00:56:12.469
FILL. THISIS NOT A DISTRICT

00:56:12.535 --> 00:56:15.205
BILL. THIS IS A BILL THAT IS

00:56:15.271 --> 00:56:17.874
SEEKING TO TAKE THE STRONG ARM

00:56:17.941 --> 00:56:21.945
OF THE STATE. N. R. ORCHESTRATE-

00:56:22.011 --> 00:56:24.748
IN OUTCOME AT A LOCAL LEVEL. I

00:56:24.814 --> 00:56:26.649
KNOW A LOT OF YOU ARE IN THIS

00:56:26.716 --> 00:56:29.419
ROOM BELIEVE IN LOCAL AUTHORITY

00:56:29.486 --> 00:56:31.654
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. THIS IS AN

00:56:31.721 --> 00:56:34.991
EXAMPLE WHERE LOCAL AUTHORITIES

00:56:35.058 --> 00:56:36.693
SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:39.062
DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES. WHETHER A

00:56:39.129 --> 00:56:43.099
PRIMARY SHOULD BE IN A- IN A- IN

00:56:43.166 --> 00:56:45.135
JUNE OR THERE MIGHT BE A GENERAL

00:56:45.201 --> 00:56:47.470
IN WHATEVER FORMAT THAT THEY SEE

00:56:47.537 --> 00:56:50.173
FIT. AND I THINK HEARING THE

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:52.609
MOTIVATION BEHIND THIS- WAS EVEN

00:56:52.675 --> 00:56:53.877
MORE DISTURBING THAT THE

00:56:53.943 --> 00:56:55.912
PARTISAN NATURE OF THE BOARD

00:56:55.979 --> 00:56:59.215
WOULD DISALLOW THIS SO WHAT HAS

00:56:59.282 --> 00:57:01.251
TO BE DONE AT THE STATE. IS THAT

00:57:01.317 --> 00:57:02.385
THE NATURE OF OUR FORM OF

00:57:02.452 --> 00:57:03.820
GOVERNMENT. THAT THE

00:57:03.887 --> 00:57:06.389
DETERMINATIVE BODY IF THEY

00:57:06.456 --> 00:57:08.091
DECIDE TO DO SOMETHING OR NOT DO

00:57:08.158 --> 00:57:09.292
SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE DECIDED

00:57:09.359 --> 00:57:11.561
THERE IN THAT ENDS IN THAT IS

00:57:11.628 --> 00:57:13.997
THE ISSUE. THIS IS TERRIBLY

00:57:14.063 --> 00:57:16.833
DANGEROUS FOR US TO LOOK UPON

00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:19.269
THIS AS A DISTRICT BILL BECAUSE

00:57:19.335 --> 00:57:21.604
IT IS USING THE STATE RESURFACED

00:57:21.671 --> 00:57:22.939
THE STRONG ARM OF THE STATE TO

00:57:23.006 --> 00:57:24.841
COME IN AND TELL THEM THAT IF

00:57:24.908 --> 00:57:27.243
YOU DON'T DO WHAT WE WANT YOU TO

00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:28.812
DO THAT WE WILL CHANGE THE

00:57:28.878 --> 00:57:30.980
RULES. IN MORE INTELLECTUALLY ON

00:57:31.047 --> 00:57:32.916
BROOCH WHAT FOR TO BE A COMPLETE

00:57:32.982 --> 00:57:34.984
STATEWIDE PROCESS WHERE

00:57:35.051 --> 00:57:37.020
PRIMARIES IN GENERAL ARE

00:57:37.086 --> 00:57:39.088
DETERMINED ACROSS THE STATE BUT

00:57:39.155 --> 00:57:41.491
I HEARD THERE WAS A LEASE FIVE

00:57:41.558 --> 00:57:43.893
JURISDICTIONS THEY DON'T DO IT

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:45.261
IN THAT FASHION. I WOULD

00:57:45.328 --> 00:57:46.396
ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUE AND I

00:57:46.462 --> 00:57:49.632
HAVE THE HIGHEST RESPECT FOR HIM

00:57:49.699 --> 00:57:51.935
. TO REVISIT THIS I THINK IT BE

00:57:52.001 --> 00:57:53.436
BETTER SUITED NOT IN ADDITION

00:57:53.503 --> 00:57:55.104
BILL FORMAT BUT AS A MATTER OF

00:57:55.171 --> 00:57:57.774
STATE POLICY AND THEN WE CAN

00:57:57.841 --> 00:57:58.908
DEBATE ON THE MERITS IN THAT

00:57:58.975 --> 00:58:05.148
FASHION. SENATOR UMBERG. I JOIN

00:58:05.215 --> 00:58:06.416
MY ESTEEMED COLLEAGUES FROM

00:58:06.482 --> 00:58:08.318
FULLERTON AND IRVINE IN

00:58:08.384 --> 00:58:11.721
SUPPORTING S. B. AT TWO EIGHTY

00:58:11.788 --> 00:58:13.756
SIX I TAKE THE POINT- THAT OUR

00:58:13.823 --> 00:58:15.859
COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO REYES BUT

00:58:15.925 --> 00:58:17.994
IT IS A STATE WIDE INTEREST I

00:58:18.061 --> 00:58:19.562
THINK TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:58:19.629 --> 00:58:21.497
ELECTIONS HAVE THE GREATEST

00:58:21.564 --> 00:58:23.266
PARTICIPATION AS IS POSSIBLE

00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:25.268
THIS IS A UNIQUE COLLECTION IT'S

00:58:25.335 --> 00:58:26.369
A PLURALITY VOTE AND IT SHOULD

00:58:26.436 --> 00:58:29.038
BE DONE- WITH THE LARGEST

00:58:29.105 --> 00:58:29.906
CONSTITUENCY THE LARGEST

00:58:29.973 --> 00:58:32.242
ELECTORATE AS IS POSSIBLE NUMBER

00:58:32.308 --> 00:58:35.445
I URGE. SENATOR NEWMAN. AT THANK

00:58:35.511 --> 00:58:37.914
YOU MEASURE DUBBED AS SOMEBODY

00:58:37.981 --> 00:58:40.183
WHO SPOKE IN SUPPORT OF THAT I'D

00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:43.319
LIKE TO RESPOND TO MY COLLEAGUE

00:58:43.386 --> 00:58:44.821
FROM FRESNO JUST TO BE VERY

00:58:44.888 --> 00:58:47.156
CLEAR- MY INTEREST AND I THINK I

00:58:47.223 --> 00:58:49.158
CAN SPEAK FOR OTHERS- AND FOR

00:58:49.225 --> 00:58:50.260
THOSE WHO VOTED COMMITTEE IT

00:58:50.326 --> 00:58:53.229
THERE THERE'S NO PARTISAN ANIMUS

00:58:53.296 --> 00:58:56.232
TO THIS VOTE- THE QUESTION HERE

00:58:56.299 --> 00:58:58.501
IS WHETHER OR NOT THE ELECTION

00:58:58.568 --> 00:59:00.470
FOR A VERY IMPORTANT OFFICE FOR

00:59:00.536 --> 00:59:02.038
COUNTY WIDE EDUCATION OFFICE.

00:59:02.105 --> 00:59:04.207
SHOULD THE RESULT SHOULD BE AS

00:59:04.274 --> 00:59:06.576
REPRESENTATIVE AS POSSIBLE- HOW

00:59:06.643 --> 00:59:08.144
WHATEVER FORM THAT TAKES BY WAY

00:59:08.211 --> 00:59:10.313
OF PARTISAN RESULT IS IMMATERIAL

00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:12.949
TO ME IT'S THIS IS A MATTER OF

00:59:13.016 --> 00:59:14.884
EQUITY NOW THIS IS A MATTER

00:59:14.951 --> 00:59:16.986
PARTICIPATION- AND ENSURING THAT

00:59:17.053 --> 00:59:18.688
THE VOICES OF THOSE MOST

00:59:18.755 --> 00:59:20.757
AFFECTED ARE HEARD- AND I KNOW

00:59:20.823 --> 00:59:22.492
THAT MY COLLEAGUE LEVINE WILL

00:59:22.558 --> 00:59:24.127
POINT THIS OUT- HIS INITIAL

00:59:24.193 --> 00:59:25.862
INTENT WAS WAS ACTUALLY TO MAKE

00:59:25.929 --> 00:59:27.730
THIS A STATEWIDE BILL- AND THERE

00:59:27.797 --> 00:59:29.332
WERE MANY WHO SUPPORTED THAT THE

00:59:29.399 --> 00:59:30.300
DECISION WAS MADE AS IT MOVED

00:59:30.366 --> 00:59:31.834
THROUGH COMMITTEE. THAT TO LIMIT

00:59:31.901 --> 00:59:33.903
THIS TO ORANGE COUNTY FOR NOW-

00:59:33.970 --> 00:59:35.004
THAT'S THE BASIS OF OUR VOTE

00:59:35.071 --> 00:59:37.140
TODAY- AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT IT

00:59:37.206 --> 00:59:39.175
IS NECESSARY IMPORTANT PRECISELY

00:59:39.242 --> 00:59:41.244
BECAUSE THE MEMBERSHIP OF THIS

00:59:41.311 --> 00:59:44.447
BOARD IS THE LEAST INCLINED TO

00:59:44.514 --> 00:59:45.715
CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF

00:59:45.782 --> 00:59:47.417
CHANGING LOCAL- AND THAT

00:59:47.483 --> 00:59:50.086
UNFORTUNATELY IS WHY NOW WE FEEL

00:59:50.153 --> 00:59:55.058
THE NEED TO DO THAT HERE. IN

00:59:55.124 --> 00:59:55.892
SACRAMENTO TODAY THANK YOU. IS

00:59:55.959 --> 00:59:58.361
THERE ANY FURTHER DOES OR TO BE.

00:59:58.428 --> 00:59:59.329
SENATOR- CHIU. SO I'M RESPONSE

00:59:59.395 --> 01:00:01.364
TO MY COLLEAGUES I DON'T THINK

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:02.265
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT

01:00:02.332 --> 01:00:05.835
WE BELIEVE THAT- IT'S TO THE

01:00:05.902 --> 01:00:07.937
INTENT TO HAVE THE GREATEST

01:00:08.004 --> 01:00:10.073
TURNOUT FOR VOTERS I THINK THE

01:00:10.139 --> 01:00:12.075
QUESTION HERE REMAINS AT LEAST

01:00:12.141 --> 01:00:14.477
FOR ME PERSONALLY. THE FACT THAT

01:00:14.544 --> 01:00:16.512
IT'S ALREADY IN STATUTE THAT

01:00:16.579 --> 01:00:19.983
THESE ELECTIONS CAN BE CHANGED-

01:00:20.049 --> 01:00:22.051
AND IT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED

01:00:22.118 --> 01:00:22.952
LOCALLY WHICH HAS NOT BEING

01:00:23.019 --> 01:00:24.287
GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE

01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:26.656
ADDRESSED COOLEY TO CHANGE THAT.

01:00:26.723 --> 01:00:28.091
WHETHER OR NOT THE MAKE UP

01:00:28.157 --> 01:00:30.860
HEATERS TO THAT TO THAT CHANGE I

01:00:30.927 --> 01:00:32.061
THINK SHOULD BE DECIDED BY THE

01:00:32.128 --> 01:00:33.896
LOCAL RESIDENTS AND LOCAL

01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:35.865
CONSTITUENTS WHO VOTE IN THOSE

01:00:35.932 --> 01:00:36.866
BOARD MEMBERS SO WHAT WE'RE

01:00:36.933 --> 01:00:39.769
SEEING HERE IS THAT. IF WE

01:00:39.836 --> 01:00:42.372
SUPERSEDE THE LOCAL CONSTITUENTS

01:00:42.438 --> 01:00:45.074
WERE SAYING THAT THE STATE IS

01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:47.276
TELLING THE LOCAL PEOPLE. HOW

01:00:47.343 --> 01:00:48.611
THEY SHOULD GO WHAT THEY SHOULD

01:00:48.678 --> 01:00:50.847
DO AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT IS

01:00:50.913 --> 01:00:54.417
ACTUALLY A FAIR- AND QUITE

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:57.186
FRANKLY- SERVICE PLEASE. RIGHT

01:00:57.253 --> 01:01:00.323
WORD FAT. WE ARE OVERSTEPPING ON

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:04.994
LOCAL VOTING CONSTITUENTS AND

01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:07.730
WHAT THEY WANT IF THEY DON'T DO

01:01:07.797 --> 01:01:09.832
NOT AGREE WITH OUR LOCAL BOARD

01:01:09.899 --> 01:01:11.501
LOCAL CONSTITUENTS HAVE THE

01:01:11.567 --> 01:01:13.770
AUTHORITY HAVE THE POWER TO

01:01:13.836 --> 01:01:15.838
CHANGE THAT PORT AND WHAT WE'RE

01:01:15.905 --> 01:01:17.140
SEEING HERE IS BECAUSE WE DON'T

01:01:17.206 --> 01:01:19.242
AGREE WITH THAT BOARD THAT THE

01:01:19.308 --> 01:01:21.010
STATE HAS THE POWER TO COME OVER

01:01:21.077 --> 01:01:22.979
AND SAY OKAY THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE

01:01:23.046 --> 01:01:25.181
GOING TO DO. SO I THINK FOR ME

01:01:25.248 --> 01:01:26.916
THE BIGGEST CONCERN IS THAT WE

01:01:26.983 --> 01:01:28.484
SHOULD ALLOW THE LOCAL

01:01:28.551 --> 01:01:30.787
CONSTITUENTS TO CHOOSE THE BOARD

01:01:30.853 --> 01:01:32.989
THAT THEY WISH AND HAVE THE

01:01:33.056 --> 01:01:35.625
BOARD THEN DIRECT AT WENDY'S

01:01:35.691 --> 01:01:36.692
ELECTIONS ARE ADDRESSED THE

01:01:36.759 --> 01:01:39.796
ISSUE THERE LOCALLY I THINK

01:01:39.862 --> 01:01:40.997
THAT'S THE BIGGEST CONCERN FOR

01:01:41.064 --> 01:01:42.098
ME. YOUR ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION

01:01:42.165 --> 01:01:44.600
OR DEBATE. DISCUSSION OR DEBATE

01:01:44.667 --> 01:01:46.569
CENTER MENU MAKE INCLUDE YES IF

01:01:46.636 --> 01:01:48.371
I COULD RESPOND TO A FEW MIKE-

01:01:48.438 --> 01:01:50.273
COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES FOR SO

01:01:50.339 --> 01:01:51.641
I THINK MY FELLOW COLLEAGUES

01:01:51.707 --> 01:01:53.076
FROM ORANGE COUNTY FOR

01:01:53.142 --> 01:01:54.744
SUPPORTING THIS BILL I IN

01:01:54.811 --> 01:01:56.145
RESPONSE MY COLLEAGUES FROM

01:01:56.212 --> 01:01:58.214
YUCAIPA IN FRESNO I WOULD I

01:01:58.281 --> 01:01:59.749
WOULD JUST SAY THIS THE ORIGINS

01:01:59.816 --> 01:02:01.317
OF THIS BILL WERE BASED ON THE

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:03.319
IDEA THAT WE SHOULD HAVE MAXIMUM

01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:04.020
TURNOUT. AND IN RESPONSE THE

01:02:04.087 --> 01:02:06.122
IDEA THAT THIS IS A LOCAL MATTER

01:02:06.189 --> 01:02:07.990
I'LL JUST POINT OUT THAT THE

01:02:08.057 --> 01:02:09.325
ABILITY TO CHANGE THIS ELECTION

01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:10.726
DATE HAS EXISTED FOR SOMETHING

01:02:10.793 --> 01:02:11.494
LIKE TWENTY TO THIRTY YEARS AND

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:13.129
NOTHING HAS HAPPENED AND THIS

01:02:13.196 --> 01:02:14.964
BILL IS NOT PARTISAN IN NATURE

01:02:15.031 --> 01:02:16.132
AS AS MY COLLEAGUE IMPORTANT

01:02:16.199 --> 01:02:18.267
POINTED OUT I TRY TO APPLY THIS

01:02:18.334 --> 01:02:19.268
INITIALLY TO ALL COUNTY WIDE

01:02:19.335 --> 01:02:20.903
ELECTIONS ACROSS THE STATE.

01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:22.105
UNFORTUNATE THAT BILL DID NOT

01:02:22.171 --> 01:02:23.606
HAVE ENOUGH SUPPORT TO GET OUT

01:02:23.673 --> 01:02:25.274
OF COMMITTEES- SO I NEVER TO

01:02:25.341 --> 01:02:27.977
ORANGE COUNTY AND TO THE ONE

01:02:28.044 --> 01:02:30.279
BODY THAT HAS ELECTIONS WE

01:02:30.346 --> 01:02:32.315
DECIDED IN A PRIMER THERE'S NO

01:02:32.381 --> 01:02:33.850
OTHER SIGNIFICANT BODY OUT THERE

01:02:33.916 --> 01:02:35.284
THAT DOES THIS OUR BOARD OF

01:02:35.351 --> 01:02:36.586
SUPERVISORS OUR DISTRICT

01:02:36.652 --> 01:02:38.254
ATTORNEYS ARE SHERIFFS ALL HAVE

01:02:38.321 --> 01:02:40.323
A TOP TWO THAT ADVANCES OUT IF

01:02:40.389 --> 01:02:42.158
SOME UNLESS SOMEONE GETS 50% THE

01:02:42.225 --> 01:02:43.493
PRIMARY. ARE STATE LEGISLATIVE

01:02:43.559 --> 01:02:44.861
OFFICES IN OUR FEDERAL OFFICES

01:02:44.927 --> 01:02:46.896
COURSE HEAVY TOP TO THE DANCE IS

01:02:46.963 --> 01:02:48.764
THE GENERAL ELECTION INTO YOUR

01:02:48.831 --> 01:02:50.199
THE TWO MIGHT THE POINT MADE BY

01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:51.968
MY COLLEAGUE FROM YUCAIPA ABOUT

01:02:52.034 --> 01:02:53.603
ALLOWING LOCAL CONSTITUENTS TO

01:02:53.669 --> 01:02:55.338
DECIDE THIS LOCALLY THAT'S

01:02:55.404 --> 01:02:57.340
PRECISELY THE POINT OF THIS BILL

01:02:57.406 --> 01:02:58.841
I'VE TALKED TO TOO MANY PEOPLE

01:02:58.908 --> 01:03:00.243
WHO DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THEY

01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:01.878
GET TO VOTE FOR BOARD OF

01:03:01.944 --> 01:03:02.378
EDUCATION SIMPLY DON'T

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:03.146
PARTICIPATE GENERALLY IN

01:03:03.212 --> 01:03:05.414
PRIMARIES. MOST PEOPLE OUT THERE

01:03:05.481 --> 01:03:05.915
BELIEVE IT WITH SAWDUST

01:03:05.982 --> 01:03:07.283
EDUCATION THE PRIMARIES ARE

01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:09.519
MEANT TO DECIDE YOUR CHOICES FOR

01:03:09.585 --> 01:03:11.854
THE GENERAL ELECTION AND SO THEY

01:03:11.921 --> 01:03:13.156
JUST GENERAL ELECTION TO DECIDE

01:03:13.222 --> 01:03:14.991
THE BOOK BETWEEN THOSE TOP TWO

01:03:15.057 --> 01:03:15.958
THEY NEVER GET THAT CHANCE AND

01:03:16.025 --> 01:03:17.994
NEVER GET THE CHANCE TO CHANGE

01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:19.896
THE MAKE UP OF THAT BOARD AND SO

01:03:19.962 --> 01:03:22.131
THIS BILL IS BASED ON THE IDEA

01:03:22.198 --> 01:03:23.799
THAT WE SHOULD GET RID OF THAT

01:03:23.866 --> 01:03:24.634
CONFUSION. WE SHOULD MAXIMIZE

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:25.902
TURN OUT. IN POWER AT THE TYPES

01:03:25.968 --> 01:03:27.236

01:11:28.784 --> 01:11:30.586
JUST ABOUT THE- COMPANY OR THE

01:13:31.373 --> 01:13:34.443
MAKING A HAMBURGER OR SHIPPING

01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:37.412
SOMEONE A NEW PAIR OF JEANS AND

01:13:37.479 --> 01:13:39.248
I THINK THE INCENTIVE TO HAVE

01:13:39.314 --> 01:13:41.683
THAT MAPPED OUT THERE WITHOUT

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:43.218
ANY REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

01:13:43.285 --> 01:13:45.120
OBLIGATION LET'S BE CLEAR THIS

01:13:45.187 --> 01:13:47.856
IS NOT A NEW REGULATORY REGIME

01:13:47.923 --> 01:13:49.792
THIS IS NOT A NEW ENFORCEMENT

01:13:49.858 --> 01:13:52.427
PROTOCOL THIS IS JUST ABOUT

01:13:52.494 --> 01:13:53.395
STANDARDIZING THE MATH. AND SO

01:13:53.462 --> 01:13:54.830
WHEN EXXON MOBIL GOES OUT AND

01:13:54.897 --> 01:13:57.266
SAYS THEIR NET ZERO BUT THEY SAY

01:13:57.332 --> 01:13:58.867
OH BUT WE DIDN'T INCLUDE ANY OF

01:13:58.934 --> 01:14:00.669
THE EMISSIONS FROM COMBUSTION

01:14:00.736 --> 01:14:01.770
ALL OF OUR GASOLINE ALL OVER THE

01:14:01.837 --> 01:14:04.106
WORLD. BUT WE'RE NOT ZERO. IS

01:14:04.173 --> 01:14:07.376
THAT REALLY FAIR. SO I WOULD I

01:14:07.442 --> 01:14:09.812
WOULD SUBMIT- THAT THIS IS GOING

01:14:09.878 --> 01:14:12.147
TO BE GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA THAT

01:14:12.214 --> 01:14:14.383
THIS IS NOT SUPERFLUOUS DATA AND

01:14:14.449 --> 01:14:16.518
THAT WHEN PEOPLE SAY SOMETHING-

01:14:16.585 --> 01:14:18.520
THEY HAVE TO MEET IT. AND

01:14:18.587 --> 01:14:20.255
ESPECIALLY CORPORATIONS IF WE'RE

01:14:20.322 --> 01:14:21.423
GOING TO TREAT THEM LIKE OTHER

01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:23.492
PEOPLE THEY HAVE TO MEAN IT TOO.

01:14:23.559 --> 01:14:25.027
SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL.

01:14:25.093 --> 01:14:33.535
CENTER GROVE. AT CENTER GROVE

01:14:33.602 --> 01:14:37.439

MADAM PRESIDENT I JUST WANTED TO

01:14:39.575 --> 01:14:41.643
COMMENT BRIEFLY YOU KNOW THAT ON

01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:43.846
THIS FOR AND ON THE ASSEMBLY

01:14:43.912 --> 01:14:45.447
FLOOR IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:14:45.514 --> 01:14:46.782
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF

01:14:46.849 --> 01:14:49.451
ANECDOTAL AND SCIENTIFIC DEBATE

01:14:49.518 --> 01:14:52.154
ON. GLOBAL WARMING GLOBAL

01:14:52.221 --> 01:14:55.190
CLIMATE CHANGE SEA LEVEL RISE.

01:14:55.257 --> 01:14:57.793
BUSINESS REGULATION AND THE

01:14:57.860 --> 01:15:00.596
IMPACTS OF A POLICIES ON

01:15:00.662 --> 01:15:03.232
BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA. BUT

01:15:03.298 --> 01:15:04.166
ONE THING THAT'S NOT OUR TO

01:15:04.233 --> 01:15:05.400
THINGS THAT AREN'T ADDING

01:15:05.467 --> 01:15:07.002
ANECDOTAL THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE

01:15:07.069 --> 01:15:09.037
NEWS RECENTLY AND THAT WERE ALL

01:15:09.104 --> 01:15:10.839
EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW IS FOR

01:15:10.906 --> 01:15:13.275
THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF

01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:14.009
CALIFORNIA. WE'VE LOST A

01:15:14.076 --> 01:15:15.777
CONGRESSIONAL SEAT THAT'S NOT

01:15:15.844 --> 01:15:19.014
ANECDOTAL. WHAT CAUSES A STATE

01:15:19.081 --> 01:15:21.316
TO LOSE A CONGRESSIONAL SEAT IS

01:15:21.383 --> 01:15:23.151
WHEN PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT STATE.

01:15:23.218 --> 01:15:25.053
AND WE BET BEGAN SEEING THIS IN

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:26.955
THE EIGHTIES WITH WHAT NOW IS

01:15:27.022 --> 01:15:28.957
CALLED THE RUST BELT STATES.

01:15:29.024 --> 01:15:29.725
WHEN THEY BEGIN LOSING

01:15:29.791 --> 01:15:30.993
CONGRESSIONAL SEATS THEY STILL

01:15:31.059 --> 01:15:32.995
HAVE NOT RECOVERED. FROM THOSE

01:15:33.061 --> 01:15:34.763
LOSSES IN SOME OF THOSE STATES

01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:35.898
EVEN CONTINUE TO LOSE

01:15:35.964 --> 01:15:39.401
CONGRESSIONAL SEATS. THIS YEAR.

01:15:39.468 --> 01:15:41.603
N. AS STATES LOSE CONGRESSIONAL

01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:43.071
SEATS THEY LOSE POLITICAL

01:15:43.138 --> 01:15:44.740
INFLUENCE AND POWER IN

01:15:44.806 --> 01:15:47.075
WASHINGTON DC. AND I WOULD HATE

01:15:47.142 --> 01:15:48.510
TO SEE OUR STATE MOVE

01:15:48.577 --> 01:15:50.846
CONTINUOUSLY IN THAT DIRECTION.

01:15:50.913 --> 01:15:51.847
THE SECOND THING IS NOT

01:15:51.914 --> 01:15:53.982
ANECDOTAL I WAS THE HEADLINE

01:15:54.049 --> 01:15:55.751
LAST WEEK IS THE MOVING COMPANY

01:15:55.817 --> 01:15:58.220
YOU HALL ACTUALLY RAN OUT OF

01:15:58.287 --> 01:16:00.822
VEHICLES. PEOPLE MOVING OUT OF

01:16:00.889 --> 01:16:03.258
CALIFORNIA. THAT IS AN

01:16:03.325 --> 01:16:07.029
UNBELIEVABLE STATISTIC AND

01:16:07.095 --> 01:16:09.932
STATEMENT OF FACT THAT ONE OF

01:16:09.998 --> 01:16:11.833
THE LARGEST MOVING COMPANIES IN

01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:15.103
THE COUNTRY ACTUALLY RAN OUT OF

01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:17.773
VEHICLES FOR PEOPLE LEAVING THE

01:16:17.839 --> 01:16:20.275
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HELLO WE

01:16:20.342 --> 01:16:22.177
CAN HAVE A DEBATE ON GLOBAL

01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:22.978
WARMING AND ITS IMPACTS ON

01:16:23.045 --> 01:16:25.614
BUSINESSES AND I THINK WE'VE HAD

01:16:25.681 --> 01:16:27.082
SEVERAL OF THOSE ROBUST DEBATE.

01:16:27.149 --> 01:16:28.684
BUT WHEN WE GET DOWN THE BOTTOM

01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:29.952
LINE OF POLICIES SUCH AS THIS

01:16:30.018 --> 01:16:33.388
ONE. WE HAVE TO ANALYZE. IS THIS

01:16:33.455 --> 01:16:35.590
COMPOUNDING THE PROBLEM. OF

01:16:35.657 --> 01:16:37.659
COMPANIES TRYING TO DO BUSINESS

01:16:37.726 --> 01:16:40.529
IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE TALK ABOUT

01:16:40.595 --> 01:16:42.631
BILLION DOLLAR COMPANIES YOU

01:16:42.698 --> 01:16:44.099
KNOW ONE OF THE IMAGES WERE

01:16:44.166 --> 01:16:46.234
TRYING TO PRO TRAIN THAT IS

01:16:46.301 --> 01:16:48.136
BILLIONAIRES AND MILLIONAIRES.

01:16:48.203 --> 01:16:49.805
BUT ONE OF THE IMPACTS THAT WE

01:16:49.871 --> 01:16:51.573
FORGET IT IS IT'S ACTUALLY

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:52.841
MIDDLE CLASS AND MORTGAGE

01:16:52.908 --> 01:16:55.143
PLAYING PAYING CALIFORNIANS THAT

01:16:55.210 --> 01:16:57.245
WORK FOR THESE BILLION DOLLAR

01:16:57.312 --> 01:16:59.114
COMPANIES. AND JUST BECAUSE

01:16:59.181 --> 01:17:00.282
THEY'RE BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY

01:17:00.349 --> 01:17:02.384
DOESN'T MEAN THEY MAKE BILLIONS

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:04.286
OF DOLLARS IN PROFIT. MEANS THEY

01:17:04.353 --> 01:17:05.454
HAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:07.322
REVENUE AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:17:07.389 --> 01:17:09.658
IN EXPENSES OF LABOR. AND PEOPLE

01:17:09.725 --> 01:17:11.193
THAT ARE LIVING IN CALIFORNIA

01:17:11.259 --> 01:17:12.694
WORKING IN CALIFORNIA WANT TO

01:17:12.761 --> 01:17:14.896
LIVE IN CALIFORNIA AND WANT TO

01:17:14.963 --> 01:17:17.332
STAY IN CALIFORNIA. AND I THINK

01:17:17.399 --> 01:17:19.301
AS WE PROVIDE PROGRESS OVER THIS

01:17:19.368 --> 01:17:21.403
COMING YEAR IT WOULD BE REALLY

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:23.972
WISE OF US. TO LOOK AT POLICIES

01:17:24.039 --> 01:17:26.842
SUCH AS THIS. AND I ACKNOWLEDGE

01:17:26.908 --> 01:17:28.710

01:17:32.347 --> 01:17:35.050
PROBLEMS OF CALIFORNIA. BUT THIS

01:17:35.117 --> 01:17:36.351
PARTICULAR POLICY I THINK DOES

01:17:36.418 --> 01:17:39.621
NOT DO THAT BUT DOES COMPOUND

01:17:39.688 --> 01:17:42.124
THE PROBLEM y

01:17:42.190 --> 01:17:43.792
AT CALIFORNIA AS A PLACE TO DO

01:17:43.859 --> 01:17:45.794
BUSINESS. COMPANIES THERE IN

01:17:45.861 --> 01:17:47.262

BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA AND

ANALYZING POLICIES LIKE THIS AND

01:17:51.566 --> 01:17:53.568
HAVING TO MAKE AN ECONOMIC

01:17:53.635 --> 01:17:55.303
DECISION ON WHETHER TO STAY OR

01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:57.906
NOT. I WOULD SUGGEST MEMBERS

01:17:57.973 --> 01:17:59.374

01:17:59.441 --> 01:18:03.178

01:20:42.571 --> 01:20:44.039
DISASTROUS IN UNDENIABLE IN

01:27:29.377 --> 01:27:30.912
BILLION DOLLARS. BUT I'LLI WORK

01:27:30.979 --> 01:27:32.080

FOR A LONG TIME AND THIS BILL IS

01:27:34.682 --> 01:27:36.484
JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE. OF

OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS I JUST

01:33:57.264 --> 01:33:58.632
HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR

01:33:58.699 --> 01:34:00.034
BASED ON SOME OF THE COMMENTS

01:34:00.101 --> 01:34:01.969
THAT I MADE IS THAT- IF YOU

01:34:02.036 --> 01:34:03.404
BECAUSE YOU AND I. DO NOT A

01:34:03.471 --> 01:34:05.006
QUESTION. YOU WILL. SO IT'S MY

01:34:05.072 --> 01:34:06.540
UNDERSTANDING AT THIS BILL.

01:34:06.607 --> 01:34:08.409
IMPACTS OF THOSE COMPANIES THAT

01:34:08.476 --> 01:34:09.910
DO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA RATHER

01:34:09.977 --> 01:34:11.012
THAN THOSE THAT ARE. THAT ARE

01:34:11.078 --> 01:34:12.413
BASED IN CALIFORNIA. WHEN THE

01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:15.049
CAUGHT SO WE IS THAT IS THAT

01:34:15.116 --> 01:34:18.285
CORRECT. I'M THROUGH THE CHAIR-

01:34:18.352 --> 01:34:20.554
YES THAT IS CORRECT THIS BILL

01:34:20.621 --> 01:34:21.956
APPLIES TO COMPANIES TO DO

01:34:22.023 --> 01:34:23.724
BUSINESS HERE. IT IS NOT LIMITED

01:34:23.791 --> 01:34:25.126
TO COMPANIES THAT ARE

01:34:25.192 --> 01:34:26.560
HEADQUARTERED HERE SO THIS IS

01:34:26.627 --> 01:34:29.797
NOT A SITUATION WHERE. YOU BUY

01:34:29.864 --> 01:34:32.199
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THIS IS NOT A

01:34:32.266 --> 01:34:33.868
SITUATION WHERE IF YOU DO A FAKE

01:34:33.934 --> 01:34:35.803
MOVE LIKE TESLA DID. TESLA

01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:37.505
DIDN'T REALLY MOVE. BABY

01:34:37.571 --> 01:34:38.773
INCORPORATED OR MOVE THEIR

01:34:38.839 --> 01:34:40.107
HEADQUARTERS TO TEXAS AND

01:34:40.174 --> 01:34:42.843
EXPANDED THEIR OPERATIONS IN

01:34:42.910 --> 01:34:43.978
CALIFORNIA. BUT MOVING YOUR

01:34:44.045 --> 01:34:45.813
HEADQUARTERS WILL NOT GET YOU

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:47.314
OUT OF THIS BILL IF YOU'RE STILL

01:34:47.381 --> 01:34:48.416
DOING BUSINESS HERE BECAUSE

01:34:48.482 --> 01:34:50.051
TESLA IS STILL SELLING AN

01:34:50.117 --> 01:34:50.951
ENORMOUS NUMBER OF CARS HERE.

01:34:51.018 --> 01:34:52.653
AFTER WE SUBSIDIZE THE HECK OUT

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:55.289
OF THE COMPANY TO GET THEM WHERE

01:34:55.356 --> 01:34:57.291
THEY ARE. TODAY SO THIS IS ABOUT

01:34:57.358 --> 01:34:58.225
DOING BUSINESS HERE I DON'T

01:34:58.292 --> 01:35:00.428
THINK THAT CHEVRON IS GOING TO

01:35:00.494 --> 01:35:02.696
CLOSE ALL OF ITS GAS STATIONS IN

01:35:02.763 --> 01:35:04.398
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO

01:35:04.465 --> 01:35:06.467
GOD FOR BID. PROVIDE DATA I

01:35:06.534 --> 01:35:08.235
DON'T THINK AMAZON IS GOING TO

01:35:08.302 --> 01:35:10.638
SHUT DOWN ALL OF ITS WAREHOUSES

01:35:10.704 --> 01:35:12.239
AND DELIVERIES IN CALIFORNIA.

01:35:12.306 --> 01:35:14.008
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO ACTUALLY

01:35:14.075 --> 01:35:15.709
PROVIDE SOME DATA I DON'T THINK

01:35:15.776 --> 01:35:16.977
MOVERS GOING TO SHUT DOWN ITS

01:35:17.044 --> 01:35:20.181
OPERATIONS. IN CALIFORNIA

01:35:20.247 --> 01:35:21.015
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE

01:35:21.082 --> 01:35:23.451
SOME DATA- DOES NOT GOING TO

01:35:23.517 --> 01:35:24.618
HAPPEN IT'S ABOUT DOING BUSINESS

01:35:24.685 --> 01:35:26.220
HERE. NOT BEING HEADQUARTERED

01:35:26.287 --> 01:35:28.989
HERE. OKAY I'M OBVIOUSLY IF YOU

01:35:29.056 --> 01:35:30.958
WERE TO FOCUS ON THOSE

01:35:31.025 --> 01:35:31.926
HEADQUARTERED HERE I THINK

01:35:31.992 --> 01:35:33.394
THEY'LL BE VERY PROBLEMATIC BUT

01:35:33.461 --> 01:35:35.062
THE REASON WHY. I RESPECTFULLY

01:35:35.129 --> 01:35:36.697
PUSH BACK ON SOME OF THE COMMON

01:35:36.764 --> 01:35:38.032
MADE. AT CERTAINLY GONNA SUPPORT

01:35:38.099 --> 01:35:38.966
THIS GIVEN THE SEVERITY THE

01:35:39.033 --> 01:35:43.137
CLIMATE CRISIS AND THE NEED FOR

01:35:43.204 --> 01:35:43.971
DATA COLLECTION. THERE'S NO

IN PLACE RIGHT NOW AND THOSE

01:43:20.994 --> 01:43:22.696
WERE ADDRESSED ACTIVELY LOOKING

01:43:22.763 --> 01:43:24.331
CALIFORNIA FLORIDA LEAD I THINK

01:43:24.398 --> 01:43:26.833
WE REALLY NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT

01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:27.935
CARBON IN GENERAL- I DID A BILL

01:43:28.001 --> 01:43:30.504
LAST YEAR- TO CAL CARBON FROM

01:43:30.571 --> 01:43:32.339
FOREST FIRES WHICH CALIFORNIA

01:43:32.406 --> 01:43:34.341
CURRENTLY DOESN'T COUNT. THE

FOREST FIRES NOW WE CAN'T BERMAN

01:43:39.913 --> 01:43:41.782
FROM- TRANSPORTATION. WE COUNT

01:43:41.848 --> 01:43:43.884
CARBON FROM. ENERGY PRODUCTION

01:43:43.951 --> 01:43:45.319
AND ALL THOSE THINGS BUT WE

01:43:45.385 --> 01:43:47.988
DON'T COUNT. THE CARBON THAT IS-

01:43:48.055 --> 01:43:50.157
SPEWED OUT IN FORCE FIRES WHICH

01:43:50.223 --> 01:43:52.125
IS THE LARGEST. CARBON EMITTER

01:43:52.192 --> 01:43:53.927
IN CALIFORNIA AND THE WORLD IN

01:43:53.994 --> 01:43:57.030
SO. I THINK THAT THIS THIS

01:43:57.097 --> 01:43:58.665
RESOLUTION IS GOING TO LEAD US

01:43:58.732 --> 01:44:00.233

HAVE A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND

01:44:03.370 --> 01:44:05.172
THAT WOULD MEAN THAT TO. THE

01:44:05.238 --> 01:44:06.006

HEALTH CRISIS. IN FOR ME I THINK

01:44:11.345 --> 01:44:12.779
THAT IS VERY DANGEROUS AND I

01:44:12.846 --> 01:44:14.781
THINK THE POLICIES THAT COME OUT

01:44:14.848 --> 01:44:17.384
OF A OF THIS HOUSE- IN THIS IN

01:44:17.451 --> 01:44:20.320
THIS LEGISLATURE ARE. FLAWED

01:44:20.387 --> 01:44:22.255
CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD.

01:44:22.322 --> 01:44:24.491
LAST YEAR HAD AN AUDIT IN THEY-

01:44:24.558 --> 01:44:25.559
DETERMINED DURING THAT AUDIT

01:44:25.626 --> 01:44:27.494
THAT- THEY WEREN'T DOING A GOOD

01:44:27.561 --> 01:44:29.463
JOB OF SPENDING HAT. MONEY OF

CALIFORNIANS THROUGH. THEIR

01:44:30.831 --> 01:44:33.233
RESOURCES BOARD AND WHAT WE WERE

01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:35.435
GETTING FROM. ALL THESE POLICIES

01:44:35.502 --> 01:44:37.704
IS DRIVING UP THE COST OF LIVING

01:44:37.771 --> 01:44:40.040
IS DRIVING UP OUR ENERGY WE PAY

01:44:40.107 --> 01:44:42.275
60% HIGHER ELECTRIC BILLS. THEN

01:44:42.342 --> 01:44:43.110
ANYWAY MOST PLACES IN THE

01:44:43.176 --> 01:44:45.646
NATION. AND THAT'S WHY PEOPLE

01:44:45.712 --> 01:44:46.246
ARE ACTUALLY IN CALIFORNIA WE

01:44:46.313 --> 01:44:49.516
DON'T COUNT- NUCLEAR IN. IN OUR

01:44:49.583 --> 01:44:51.818
ENERGY AS AS A CARBON NEUTRAL WE

01:44:51.885 --> 01:44:54.388
DON'T COUNT A LARGE HYDRO ONLY

01:44:54.454 --> 01:44:55.956
THIRTY MEGAWATTS OF LAST. A

01:44:56.023 --> 01:44:57.557
WIRED THOSE COUNTED AND WIRE

01:44:57.624 --> 01:44:58.992

BUT IT DID BUT WHILE WE'RE DOING

01:45:04.731 --> 01:45:06.767
REALLY IS WERE EXPORTING JOBS.

01:45:06.833 --> 01:45:09.403
FROM CALIFORNIA TO COUNTRIES

LIKE CHINA THAT ARE. OR WHITE

01:45:12.105 --> 01:45:13.707
FRANKLY BUILDING COAL FIRED

01:45:13.774 --> 01:45:15.842
POWER PLANTS IT'S AS WE SPEAK

01:45:15.909 --> 01:45:17.411
AND WE'RE BREATHING THAT AIR SO

01:45:17.477 --> 01:45:18.979
I THINK THE POLICY IS WHAT WE

01:45:19.046 --> 01:45:20.814
REALLY NEED TO TALK ABOUT NOT

01:45:20.881 --> 01:45:23.617
JUST MAKING A STATEMENT AND IN.

01:45:23.684 --> 01:45:26.386
MAKING PEOPLE. MORE FEARFUL

01:45:26.453 --> 01:45:27.754
THAT'S REALLY LEAD IF WE'RE

01:45:27.821 --> 01:45:28.822
GONNA LEADING CALIFORNIA'S

01:45:28.889 --> 01:45:31.258
LEADING US LET'S DO SOME REAL

01:45:31.324 --> 01:45:32.359
GOOD ENVIRONMENTAL WORK AND THAT

01:45:32.426 --> 01:45:34.461
MEANS. LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT THE

01:45:34.528 --> 01:45:35.729
FORCES TALK ABOUT A WATERSHED

01:45:35.796 --> 01:45:37.497
JUST TALK ABOUT THE WILDLIFE

01:45:37.564 --> 01:45:38.365
THAT IS IT DID DID DID

01:45:38.432 --> 01:45:40.667
DESPERATELY NEEDS. TO BE LOOKED

01:45:40.734 --> 01:45:44.404
AT NOT JUST STATING F. THIS

01:45:44.471 --> 01:45:46.707
RESOLUTION IS SAYING HEY WE IT'S

01:45:46.773 --> 01:45:48.308
A CLIMATE EMERGENCY YEP NO DOUBT

01:45:48.375 --> 01:45:50.410
WHEN A CRIME IS NOT AN ALMOST A

01:45:50.477 --> 01:45:51.044
MILLION ACRE FIRE. BUT WE DON'T

01:45:51.111 --> 01:45:53.647
DO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT FIRES WERE

01:45:53.714 --> 01:45:54.581
REGULATING LAWN MOWERS WEED

01:45:54.648 --> 01:45:56.883
EATERS. AND GENERATORS WHICH WE

01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:58.118
NEED BECAUSE WE ARE POWER

01:45:58.185 --> 01:45:59.986
OUTAGES THAT'S THE STUFF THAT

01:46:00.053 --> 01:46:01.488
JUST LEGISLATURE DOING IS WHAT'S

01:46:01.555 --> 01:46:02.456
COSTS. CAUSING CALIFORNIA TO PAY

01:46:02.522 --> 01:46:04.858
HIGHER IN BUILDING FEES HIGHER

01:46:04.925 --> 01:46:08.095
IN. IN THE TRANSPORTATION COST.

01:46:08.161 --> 01:46:09.529
AND THAT'S WHAT'S THE REALLY THE

01:46:09.596 --> 01:46:10.630
PROBLEM HERE CALIFORNIA THAT'S

01:46:10.697 --> 01:46:12.866
CAUSING INFLATION TO GO UP AND

01:46:12.933 --> 01:46:16.069
IS THE RESULT OF THE LACK OF

01:46:16.136 --> 01:46:17.104
THIS LEGISLATURE DOING REAL

01:46:17.170 --> 01:46:18.338
GOOD. ENVIRONMENTAL WORK I'M

01:46:18.405 --> 01:46:19.039
LOOKING FOR SOME ENVIRONMENTS

01:46:19.106 --> 01:46:20.307
THAT REALLY CARE ABOUT THE

01:46:20.373 --> 01:46:22.409
ENVIRONMENT THE WANT TO DO THE

01:46:22.476 --> 01:46:22.943
RIGHT THING AND NOT JUST.

01:46:23.009 --> 01:46:24.745
REGULATE AND PUT FEAR INTO THE

01:46:24.811 --> 01:46:26.079
PEOPLE LET'S TALK ABOUT THE

01:46:26.146 --> 01:46:26.847
POLICIES. THAT COME OUT OF THIS

01:46:26.913 --> 01:46:28.815
LEGISLATURE IN THIS BILL THIS

01:46:28.882 --> 01:46:31.818
BILL. IS- IS THIS GONNA DO MORE

01:46:31.885 --> 01:46:33.320
HERE AND IT IS GOING TO SOLVE

01:46:33.386 --> 01:46:35.122
THE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEMS ARE WE

01:46:35.188 --> 01:46:36.556
HAVE A BULLET TRAIN. WE'RE

01:46:36.623 --> 01:46:38.325
SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON

01:46:38.391 --> 01:46:39.726
THAT IS NOT EVER GOING TO GET

01:46:39.793 --> 01:46:42.229
OUR- CARBON REDUCED. ITS BECAUSE

01:46:42.295 --> 01:46:43.396
SPECIAL INTERESTS IS RUNNING

01:46:43.463 --> 01:46:45.265
THIS AND IT'S REALLY NOT ABOUT

01:46:45.332 --> 01:46:46.867
THE ENVIRONMENT I PREFER TO BE

01:46:46.933 --> 01:46:47.834
ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT SHOULD

01:46:47.901 --> 01:46:49.503
INCLUDE FORCE FIRE. YOUR CARBON

01:46:49.569 --> 01:46:53.406
OUTPUT. SO FOR THOSE REASONS I'M

01:46:53.473 --> 01:46:54.608
NOT GONNA BE SUPPORTING THIS

01:46:54.674 --> 01:46:55.408
LEGISLATION. IS THERE ANY

01:46:55.475 --> 01:46:57.010

RUSHED TO GREEN AND TRANSITION.

01:47:10.357 --> 01:47:12.092
IS ALREADY DISASTER BULL AND

01:47:12.159 --> 01:47:14.728
DISASTROUS AND- DENIABLE HERE IN

01:47:14.795 --> 01:47:17.030
CALIFORNIA. WE TALKED ABOUT-

01:47:17.097 --> 01:47:18.532

OF THOSE THINGS. ONE OF THE

01:47:23.303 --> 01:47:25.071
THINGS THAT WE DON'T REALIZE IS

01:47:25.138 --> 01:47:26.239
THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS

01:47:26.306 --> 01:47:28.041
THE NUMBER ONE PURCHASER OF

01:47:28.108 --> 01:47:30.210
ECUADORIAN OIL. WHEN YOU LOOK AT

01:47:30.277 --> 01:47:31.578
THEM THE OIL THAT'S PRODUCED IN

01:47:31.645 --> 01:47:33.513
ECUADOR. IT'S AN ALTERNATIVE TO

01:47:33.580 --> 01:47:34.881
LOCAL AND GAS PRODUCTION AND

01:47:34.948 --> 01:47:36.149
IMPORTATION FROM FOREIGN

THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY. AND WE

01:47:58.471 --> 01:48:00.106
IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T NEED OR

01:48:00.173 --> 01:48:02.275
USE THE OIL AND GAS THAT IS

01:48:02.342 --> 01:48:04.177
PRODUCED. WE JUST DON'T PRODUCE

01:48:04.244 --> 01:48:06.112
IT IN OUR BACKYARD LIKE NIMBYISM

01:48:06.179 --> 01:48:07.981

WORLD COUNTRY TAKE THE FIVE

01:50:34.427 --> 01:50:35.395
POOREST COUNTRIES IN THE NATION

01:50:35.462 --> 01:50:36.896
THEY HAVE NO PETROLEUM AND NO

01:50:36.963 --> 01:50:40.066
OIL AND GAS. SO TO SET A GOAL

01:50:40.133 --> 01:50:41.534
EVEN THOUGH IT'S A NON BINDING

01:50:41.601 --> 01:50:43.937
RESOLUTION BUT TO SET A GOAL OF

01:50:44.004 --> 01:50:46.072
WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THIS STATE

01:50:46.139 --> 01:50:48.341
CAPITOL TO DESTROY AGAIN

01:50:48.408 --> 01:50:50.176
NIMBYISM. YOU DON'T WANT TO

01:50:50.243 --> 01:50:51.411
PRODUCE IT HERE UNDER THE

01:50:51.478 --> 01:50:52.012
STRICTEST MOST ENVIRONMENTAL

01:50:52.078 --> 01:50:54.347
QUALITY PRO LAWS IN THE MOST

01:50:54.414 --> 01:50:56.216
EXTREME JUST LABOR LAWS IN THE

WORLD. BUT YOU LET THEM TEAR

01:50:58.251 --> 01:51:00.053
DOWN THE RAINFOREST- YOU'LL LET

01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:02.222
THEM TAKE AWAY INDIGENOUS

01:51:02.288 --> 01:51:04.124
INDIANS- YOU KNOW THE AREA OF

01:51:04.190 --> 01:51:05.992
SPACE THAT THEY LIVE IN JUST TO

01:51:06.059 --> 01:51:07.060
GET THOSE SAME COMFORTS THAT YOU

HERE ACROSS OUR ECOSYSTEM. IN

01:51:11.865 --> 01:51:14.567
VESSELS THAT BUNKER FUEL THAT

01:51:14.634 --> 01:51:15.869
PUT MORE CARBON EMISSIONS OUT

01:51:15.935 --> 01:51:18.071
INTO THE AIR. ALMOST PROBABLY

01:51:18.138 --> 01:51:19.773
EQUIVALENT TO OVER A PRETTY

01:51:19.839 --> 01:51:21.474
DECENT WILDFIRE SO I WOULD JUST

01:51:21.541 --> 01:51:23.309
ASK YOUR NO VOTE ON THIS

01:51:23.376 --> 01:51:24.377
RESOLUTION IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT

01:51:24.444 --> 01:51:25.678
GLOBAL WARMING AND CLIMATE

01:51:25.745 --> 01:51:27.514
CHANGE AND IT IS. EXACTLY WHAT

YOU THINK IT IS ABOUT YOU KNOW

01:51:29.416 --> 01:51:30.784
DISASTROUS IT'S COMING THEN

LET'S ADDRESS IT FROM A GLOBAL

01:51:33.787 --> 01:51:35.088
PERSPECTIVE AND USE THE MOST.

01:51:35.155 --> 01:51:37.524
RELIABLE CHEAP RELIABLE ENERGY

01:51:37.590 --> 01:51:38.925
THAT SAFE AND PRODUCED HERE IN

01:51:38.992 --> 01:51:40.860
CALIFORNIA BEFORE IMPORTING ALL

01:51:40.927 --> 01:51:43.563
THESE- THESE PRODUCTS FROM THE

01:51:43.630 --> 01:51:44.831
COUNTRY THE NUMBER ONE IS

01:51:44.898 --> 01:51:47.400
HOSTILE AS HAS HUMAN RIGHTS

01:51:47.467 --> 01:51:49.602

OF CLIMB EMERGENCY AS WE ALL

01:52:59.205 --> 01:53:00.673
KNOW THE POWERS OF THE GOVERNOR

01:53:00.740 --> 01:53:01.274
ARE ESTABLISHED BY THE STATE

01:53:01.341 --> 01:53:03.576
CONSTITUTION. AND ENHANCED

01:53:03.643 --> 01:53:04.777
THROUGH STATUTE NOT THROUGH A

01:53:04.844 --> 01:53:07.747
RESOLUTION. AND I AM CONCERNED

01:53:07.814 --> 01:53:09.916
ABOUT WE HAVE HAD THE GOVERNOR

TOO MANY OF THE PEOPLE ARE YOUR

01:53:23.329 --> 01:53:24.931
FRIENDS BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR'S

01:53:24.998 --> 01:53:25.932
MAKING ALL THE DECISIONS BY

01:53:25.999 --> 01:53:28.668
PASSING US. IN I DON'T THINK ANY

01:53:28.735 --> 01:53:29.836
ONE OF US SHOULD AGREE THAT

01:53:29.903 --> 01:53:31.037
THAT'S THE PROPER WAY TO GOVERN.

01:53:31.104 --> 01:53:32.138
UNDER OUR CONSTITUTION SHOULD BE

OPERATING IN THIS JUST ABOUT THE

01:53:34.474 --> 01:53:35.875
NEW STAGE FOR THAT. SO I WILL

GUARDRAILS I TO MAKE SURE THE

02:07:56.902 --> 02:07:59.605
FLAWED SCIENCE DOES NOT MAKE ITS

WHATEVER. BASED ON ALLEGATIONS.

THESE ARE JUST MORE ATTEMPTS TO

02:08:36.308 --> 02:08:39.611
BE ROLLED THE JUSTICE SYSTEM TO

02:08:39.678 --> 02:08:41.447
ENSURE THAT JUSTICE FOR THE

02:08:41.513 --> 02:08:43.949
VICTIMS OF CRIMES DO NOT SEE

02:08:44.016 --> 02:08:46.985
JUSTICE DONE. THAT INDIVIDUALS

MORE VENUES TO ESCAPE ANY

02:08:51.657 --> 02:08:54.827
CONSEQUENCES FOR THEIR BEHAVIORS

02:08:54.893 --> 02:08:56.595

CITIES UPON CITIES AND WHAT'S

02:09:24.123 --> 02:09:25.757
GOING ON WITHIN THOSE CITIES

02:09:25.824 --> 02:09:28.460
RIGHT NOW IS JUST AMERICA FOR

02:09:28.527 --> 02:09:30.729
THE FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN I

02:09:30.796 --> 02:09:32.898
THINK NOT AND THERE'S MORE OF

02:09:32.965 --> 02:09:36.101
THESE INCREMENTAL BILLS. THAT

02:09:36.168 --> 02:09:38.170
ARE COMING THE TRIM AROUND THE

02:09:38.237 --> 02:09:40.139
EDGES TO GIVE THE DEFENSE

02:09:40.205 --> 02:09:44.776

WRONGFULLY CONVICTED. WE HAVE

02:10:03.328 --> 02:10:04.596
MANY VENUES FOR THOSE

02:10:04.663 --> 02:10:08.734
INDIVIDUALS TO SEE JUST REMEDY.

02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:10.769

THANK GOD SHE DOES BECAUSE THERE

02:10:12.337 --> 02:10:16.275
ARE ERRORS. BUT NOT NEAR AS MANY

02:10:16.341 --> 02:10:19.244
AS SOME TALENT RIGHT NOW. YOU

02:10:19.311 --> 02:10:21.747
KNOW FOR A WHILE A FEW YEARS WE

02:10:21.813 --> 02:10:25.951
WENT THROUGH THIS. TREND OR THE

02:10:26.018 --> 02:10:29.388
FAD ALL DIMINISH IT EVEN TO CALL

THOSE YEARS OF QUOTE TO TOUGH ON

02:10:38.197 --> 02:10:39.898
CRIME IN THE MINDS OF SOME.

02:10:39.965 --> 02:10:43.969

JUSTICE DONE IN THOSE RARE

02:10:48.807 --> 02:10:50.776
INSTANCES WERE JUSTICE DID NOT

THE INSTANCES. I REGION NO VOTE

02:10:58.317 --> 02:10:59.985
ON ALMOST ALL OF THESE BILLS

02:11:00.052 --> 02:11:02.354
LADIES AND GENTLEMAN IT'S TIME

02:11:02.421 --> 02:11:05.357
TO SAY ENOUGH JUSTICE FOR

02:11:05.424 --> 02:11:08.026
CONVICTED CRIMINALS AND MORE

02:11:08.093 --> 02:11:11.463
JUSTICE FOR A LAW ABIDING SIX

02:11:11.530 --> 02:11:14.633
CITIZENS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY.

02:11:14.700 --> 02:11:18.904
VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES.

02:11:18.971 --> 02:11:29.047
SENATOR KAMLAGER. THANK YOU

SEVEN I WASN'T REALLY PLANNING

02:11:37.856 --> 02:11:39.992
TO SAY ANYTHING BUT- AFTER

02:11:40.058 --> 02:11:42.961
LISTENING TO SOME OF THE COMMON

02:11:43.028 --> 02:11:48.066
SPELLED- COMPELLED- YOU KNOW.

02:11:48.133 --> 02:11:49.801
OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM IS NOT

02:11:49.868 --> 02:11:53.372
PERFECT. B. IT IS INCREDIBLY

02:11:53.438 --> 02:11:56.208
FLAWED BECAUSE OUR JUSTICE

02:11:56.275 --> 02:11:58.810
SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED AND IS RUN

02:11:58.877 --> 02:12:03.348
BY PEOPLE. AND PEOPLE ARE FLAWED

02:12:03.415 --> 02:12:05.817
AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY NOT

02:12:05.884 --> 02:12:08.120
TO TURN AROUND THE EDGES BUT TO

02:12:08.186 --> 02:12:13.659
REALLY INJECT. SOME FAIRNESS- AN

02:12:13.725 --> 02:12:17.963
OBJECTIVE THINKING ABOUT

02:12:18.030 --> 02:12:22.134
TESTIMONY AND ABOUT INFORMATION

02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:25.971
THAT IS SHARED WITH JURORS

02:12:26.038 --> 02:12:28.940
DURING TRIALS AND HOW THAT

02:12:29.007 --> 02:12:31.643
INFORMATION IS SHARED AND OFTEN

02:12:31.710 --> 02:12:35.447
TIMES IT IS SHARED BY FOLKS WHO

02:12:35.514 --> 02:12:39.318
ARE LOOSELY TERMED EXPERTS THIS

02:12:39.384 --> 02:12:41.253
BILL IS A NOT IT IS NOT ABOUT

02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:43.422
CRIMES THE BILL IS NOT ABOUT

02:12:43.488 --> 02:12:45.991
CRIMINALS IT IS NOT ABOUT PEOPLE

02:12:46.058 --> 02:12:47.859
DOING STUFF THAT'S BAD. IT'S

02:12:47.926 --> 02:12:50.062
ABOUT PROCESS AND IT'S ABOUT

02:12:50.128 --> 02:12:52.998
TESTIMONY. AND SO MANY FOLKS CAN

02:12:53.065 --> 02:12:57.035
FIND THEIR WAY. INTO A TRIAL IN

02:12:57.102 --> 02:12:59.971
FRONT OF A JURY WITH THAT TITLE

02:13:00.038 --> 02:13:03.308
EXPERT. LAUDING SOME KIND OF

02:13:03.375 --> 02:13:06.511
INFORMATION THAT IS FLAWED THAT

02:13:06.578 --> 02:13:11.183
IS SUBJECTIVE. AND THAT IS HARD

02:13:11.249 --> 02:13:14.686
TO VERIFY. BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS

02:13:14.753 --> 02:13:16.421
WHEN YOU COME BEFORE A JURY

02:13:16.488 --> 02:13:22.294
JURORS. WITH PARTICULAR TITLES.

02:13:22.361 --> 02:13:24.329
WHEN IT COMES A LOT OF

02:13:24.396 --> 02:13:25.697
ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE KIND OF

02:13:25.764 --> 02:13:26.698
INFORMATION THAT YOU'RE

02:13:26.765 --> 02:13:28.400
PRESENTING. AND WHEN YOU'RE

02:13:28.467 --> 02:13:30.168
DISCUSSING WHETHER OR NOT TO

02:13:30.235 --> 02:13:32.437
SEND SOMEONE SOMEONE AWAY. FOR

02:13:32.504 --> 02:13:36.775
LONG PERIODS OF TIME OR FOR LIFE

02:13:36.842 --> 02:13:40.212
. IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD THING. TO

02:13:40.278 --> 02:13:42.981
MAKE SURE THAT THE FOLKS WHO ARE

02:13:43.048 --> 02:13:45.016
TESTIFYING IN PROVIDING

02:13:45.083 --> 02:13:47.352
INFORMATION ARE PROVIDING

02:13:47.419 --> 02:13:52.290
ACCURATE VERIFIABLE. INFORMATION

02:13:52.357 --> 02:13:53.625
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY YOU ARE

02:13:53.692 --> 02:13:55.994
DECIDING IF SOMEONE IS GOING TO

02:13:56.061 --> 02:14:00.031
GO AWAY FOR LIFE. VERY LONG TIME

02:14:00.098 --> 02:14:03.301
OR NOT. THAT IS WHAT THIS BLL

02:14:03.368 --> 02:14:05.670
SAYS AND ONCE AGAIN I JUST

02:14:05.737 --> 02:14:08.073
IMPLORE US TO CONSIDER THE

02:14:08.140 --> 02:14:11.109
JUDICIAL SYSTEM. AND IT IS A

02:14:11.176 --> 02:14:14.212
BATTLE BETWEEN SIDES OFFERING

02:14:14.279 --> 02:14:23.822
INFORMATION AND NARRATIVE. ABOUT. YOU SHOULD REALLY MAKE SURE

02:14:23.889 --> 02:14:26.057
THAT THE INFORMATION THAT YOU

02:14:26.124 --> 02:14:28.960
ARE PRESENTING IS TRUE. AND IS

02:14:29.027 --> 02:14:32.898
NOT CLOUDED BY TITLES AND FALSE

02:14:32.964 --> 02:14:36.601
INFORMATION THAT IS NOT WHAT WE

02:14:36.668 --> 02:14:39.404
WANT OUR COURTS TO REPRESENT SO

02:14:39.471 --> 02:14:41.873
WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE

02:14:41.940 --> 02:14:43.775
VOTE ON AS BEFORE SIX SEVEN.

02:14:43.842 --> 02:14:49.981
SENATOR BRIDGES. THIS IS AN

02:14:50.048 --> 02:14:53.585
INTERESTING ISSUE. THE COUPLE OF

02:14:53.652 --> 02:14:55.954
POPULAR COMMENTS. THE BEEN

02:14:56.021 --> 02:14:59.424
AROUND FOR A LONG TIME. THAT

02:14:59.491 --> 02:15:01.426
EVEN A HAM SANDWICH COULD BE

02:15:01.493 --> 02:15:04.830
INDICTED. AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING

02:15:04.896 --> 02:15:07.866
FOR AN EXPERT TO SERVE AS AN

02:15:07.933 --> 02:15:11.837
EXPERT WITNESS. SKY'S THE LIMIT

02:15:11.903 --> 02:15:13.839
YOU CAN GET ANYBODY TO SAY

02:15:13.905 --> 02:15:16.508
VIRTUALLY ANYTHING. IT IS

02:15:16.575 --> 02:15:19.010
ACTUALLY TRUE THE SYSTEM IS

02:15:19.077 --> 02:15:23.482
PRONE TO BUY AN OPINION- TYPE OF

02:15:23.548 --> 02:15:26.284
SCENARIO WE'VE SEEN IT WE KNOW

02:15:26.351 --> 02:15:28.019
WHAT HAPPENS. BUT I THINK WE

02:15:28.086 --> 02:15:29.054
ALSO HAVE A FLIP SIDE OF THIS

02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:31.022
COIN I THINK THE AUTHOR IS

02:15:31.089 --> 02:15:33.458
TRYING TO REMEDY SOMETHING IS

02:15:33.525 --> 02:15:35.727
MERITORIOUS. IS THAT WE WANT TO

02:15:35.794 --> 02:15:37.562
BRING. A GREATER SCRUTINY

02:15:37.629 --> 02:15:39.130
GREATER CREDENTIALS GREATER

02:15:39.197 --> 02:15:41.166
QUALIFICATIONS IN THE ASSESSMENT

02:15:41.233 --> 02:15:43.602
OF ALL THAT THAT GOES INTO

02:15:43.668 --> 02:15:44.803
WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE SHOULD BE

02:15:44.870 --> 02:15:46.404
DEEMED AN EXPERT. I WOULD

02:15:46.471 --> 02:15:47.906
CAUTION MY COLLEAGUES HOWEVER

02:15:47.973 --> 02:15:49.374
THAT THERE COULD BE A SERIOUS

02:15:49.441 --> 02:15:52.410
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE HERE. AND

02:15:52.477 --> 02:15:53.612
THAT WOULD BE THE CREATION OF

02:15:53.678 --> 02:15:55.580
COTTAGE INDUSTRY. TO ABSOLUTELY

02:15:55.647 --> 02:15:57.182
CREATE COUNTER SCIENCE

02:15:57.249 --> 02:16:00.285
DELIBERATELY TODAY WHEN YOU DO

02:16:00.352 --> 02:16:02.220
HAVE SOMEBODY OUR WHO IS

02:16:02.287 --> 02:16:04.222
PRESENTING ON MATERIAL BASED ON

02:16:04.289 --> 02:16:07.025
SCIENCE OR DATA THAT THERE IS A

02:16:07.092 --> 02:16:08.560
BODY OF SCHOLARSHIP OUT THERE

02:16:08.627 --> 02:16:11.763
THAT CAN BE USED PRECISELY FOR

02:16:11.830 --> 02:16:13.398
THE PURPOSE OF. UNDERMINING IT.

02:16:13.465 --> 02:16:14.799
THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS

02:16:14.866 --> 02:16:16.968
SITUATION THAT FRANKLY COULD BE

02:16:17.035 --> 02:16:18.470
AS DANGEROUS IT'S THE SITUATION

02:16:18.537 --> 02:16:21.406
WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW. I APPLAUD

02:16:21.473 --> 02:16:23.708
THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING ON THIS

02:16:23.775 --> 02:16:25.810
THIS IS A- THIS PROJECT THIS

02:16:25.877 --> 02:16:28.346
PIECE OF LEGISLATION. BUT I

02:16:28.413 --> 02:16:30.482
DON'T SEE HOW IT'S GOING TO

02:16:30.549 --> 02:16:32.117
RESOLVE WHAT IS INHERENTLY

02:16:32.183 --> 02:16:35.186
UNRESOLVABLE WHICH IS THE JURY

02:16:35.253 --> 02:16:36.788
OR THE JUDGE HAS THE

02:16:36.855 --> 02:16:38.690
RESPONSIBILITY TO DETERMINE THE

02:16:38.757 --> 02:16:42.627
WEIGHT. AN EXPERT OPINION HAS ON

02:16:42.694 --> 02:16:43.828
THE BEARING AN OUTCOME OF THE

02:16:43.895 --> 02:16:46.965
CASE. THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF OUR

02:16:47.032 --> 02:16:49.901
SYSTEM. SAME WAY IT IS WITH

02:16:49.968 --> 02:16:51.903
SOMEONE WHO IS A PROPOSED

02:16:51.970 --> 02:16:54.673
WITNESS. THEY WEIGHED THE MERITS

02:16:54.739 --> 02:16:57.509
AND IN CIRCUMSTANCES OF THAT

02:16:57.576 --> 02:16:59.578
OPINION OR THAT OBSERVATION. I

02:16:59.644 --> 02:17:01.513
DON'T THINK THERE'S A WAY OUT OF

02:17:01.580 --> 02:17:04.416
IT- RUSSIAN REGRETFULLY I'M

02:17:04.482 --> 02:17:06.685
GONNA HAVE TO- NOT SUPPORT THIS

02:17:06.751 --> 02:17:09.054
TODAY BUT I THINK WHAT HE'S

02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:10.288
TRYING WITH WITH THE OTHERS

02:17:10.355 --> 02:17:12.123
TRYING TO DO HAS MERIT. BUT I

02:17:12.190 --> 02:17:13.892
THINK THAT THERE IS A MORE

02:17:13.959 --> 02:17:14.859
NATURAL WAY THAT IT CAN BE

THEMSELVES AS EXPERTS OFTENTIMES

02:17:41.686 --> 02:17:43.455

SENATOR A. THANK YOU AMEND

PROSECUTOR WHO ULTIMATELY BECAME

02:17:53.565 --> 02:17:55.300
A DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN IS PRO

02:17:55.367 --> 02:17:57.802
LIFE SERVED ACTUALLY IN THIS

02:17:57.869 --> 02:18:01.806
LEGISLATURE IN ANOTHER CHAMBER.

CONVERT CONVICTED INDIVIDUAL WHO

02:18:09.981 --> 02:18:13.518
IS GUILTY. IT TAKES A GREAT

02:18:13.585 --> 02:18:14.919
PROSECUTOR TO CONVICT SOMEONE

02:18:14.986 --> 02:18:19.424

02:18:19.491 --> 02:18:22.127
SIMPLY PUTS. EXPERT WITNESS

TESTIMONY ON THE SAME FOOTING IS

02:18:24.229 --> 02:18:26.564
TESTIMONY OF PERCIPIENT FACT

02:18:26.631 --> 02:18:28.767
BASED WITNESSES WHO TESTIFY IN

02:18:28.833 --> 02:18:31.936
TRIAL. AND WE'RE THERE ARE

02:18:32.003 --> 02:18:34.406
DEFECTS IN THAT TESTIMONY OF ONE

02:18:34.472 --> 02:18:36.808
SORT OR ANOTHER. WHETHER IT'S A

02:18:36.875 --> 02:18:38.276

02:18:41.379 --> 02:18:44.849
DISCOVERED POST TRIAL. THAT THE

02:18:44.916 --> 02:18:51.923
CASE IS REVIEWED. BY A COURT.

02:18:51.990 --> 02:18:53.792
AND IN APPROPRIATE CASES JUSTICE

02:18:53.858 --> 02:18:57.529
IS DONE. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS

02:18:57.595 --> 02:19:00.198
PROCESS IS ALL ABOUT. IT'S NOT

02:19:00.265 --> 02:19:02.634
PROSECUTING THOSE IN CONVICTING

02:19:02.701 --> 02:19:05.270
THOSE WHO ARE NOT GUILTY. WHERE

02:19:05.336 --> 02:19:06.971
THERE ARE PROSECUTING THOSE

02:19:07.038 --> 02:19:09.174

TESTIMONY TO ENSURE THAT THEY

02:19:13.078 --> 02:19:15.213
ARE CONVICTED EVEN THOUGH THEY

02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:17.015
MAY NOT BE. IT IS MAKING SURE

02:19:17.082 --> 02:19:20.185
THAT THE PROCESS IS FAIR. AND

02:19:20.251 --> 02:19:22.654

SCIENCE. TESTIMONY THAT IS

02:19:29.627 --> 02:19:31.896

SHOULD BE A CRIME OR NOT A

02:20:13.571 --> 02:20:14.572
CRIME. WHY SHOULD THE SENTENCE

BE- AND SO ON AND SO FORTH AND

02:20:17.108 --> 02:20:18.877

THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE FIGHTS

02:20:27.285 --> 02:20:29.287

FIFTEEN YEARS AS- AS A ATTORNEY

02:21:45.063 --> 02:21:46.164
MOST OF IT HERE THE BOTTOM LINE

02:21:46.231 --> 02:21:48.233
OPINION IT'S SO POWERFUL. AND

02:21:48.299 --> 02:21:50.535
YOU REALIZE THAT IS BASED TRULY

02:21:50.602 --> 02:21:52.737
ON JUNK. AND SOMETIMES IT'S

02:21:52.804 --> 02:21:56.174
BECAUSE- FIFTY YEARS AGO. THE

02:21:56.241 --> 02:21:58.109
CALIFORNIA COURT OF APPEAL.

02:21:58.176 --> 02:22:00.612
DECIDED THAT ACCESS KIND OF ACTS

02:22:00.678 --> 02:22:02.347
FOR WITNESSING WAS APPROPRIATE.

02:22:02.413 --> 02:22:03.514
AND EVEN THOUGH THERE'S BEEN

02:22:03.581 --> 02:22:05.783
ENORMOUS SCIENCES SINCE AND THAT

02:22:05.850 --> 02:22:08.553
HAS SHOWN. THAT IT IS REALLY

02:22:08.620 --> 02:22:10.421
DUBIOUS COURTS JUST KEEP LETTING

02:22:10.488 --> 02:22:12.457
IT AND LETTING IT END. BECAUSE

02:22:12.523 --> 02:22:14.058
OF WHAT HAPPENED YEARS AGO WE'VE

02:22:14.125 --> 02:22:16.227
SEEN THIS WITH. MICRO HAIR

02:22:16.294 --> 02:22:18.596
ANALYSIS RECEITA WITH

02:22:18.663 --> 02:22:20.632
FINGERPRINTING ANALYSIS THAT

02:22:20.698 --> 02:22:22.901
OVER TIME NEW SCIENCE COMES OUT.

02:22:22.967 --> 02:22:24.936
AND YET THESE THIS TESTIMONY

02:22:25.003 --> 02:22:27.138
JUST KEEPS COMING IN. AND THIS

02:22:27.205 --> 02:22:29.007
SIMPLY STRENGTHENS THE GUARD

02:22:29.073 --> 02:22:30.975
RAILS. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

02:22:31.042 --> 02:22:33.478
KIND OF JUNK SCIENCE WERE REALLY

02:22:33.544 --> 02:22:35.747
DEEPLY DISPUTED SCIENCE DOES NOT

02:22:35.813 --> 02:22:40.485
OVERWHELM. ON A JURY. AND TO BE

02:22:40.551 --> 02:22:42.353
CLEAR. WHAT THIS ISN'T ABOUT

02:22:42.420 --> 02:22:44.455
WHETHER RELATING CRIMINALS GET

02:22:44.522 --> 02:22:46.958
OUT OF JAIL FREE. THIS IS ABOUT

02:22:47.025 --> 02:22:48.526
MAKING SURE THAT IF WE CAN PICK

02:22:48.593 --> 02:22:49.894
SOMEONE IT'S ACTUALLY THE PERSON

02:22:49.961 --> 02:22:52.030
WHO DID IT THE ONE INNOCENT

02:22:52.096 --> 02:22:54.465
PERSON GOES TO JAIL. NOT ONLY

02:22:54.532 --> 02:22:55.867
DOES NOT DESTROY THE LIFE OF

02:22:55.934 --> 02:22:57.969
THAT INDIVIDUAL AND THEIR FAMILY

02:22:58.036 --> 02:23:00.104
HOW IS THAT FAIR TO THE VICTIM.

02:23:00.171 --> 02:23:01.039
THE PERSON WHO ACTUALLY

02:23:01.105 --> 02:23:02.473
COMMITTED THE CRIME IS NOT THE

02:23:02.540 --> 02:23:04.842
ONE WHO WENT TO JAIL THAT

02:23:04.909 --> 02:23:05.610
DOESN'T HELP THE VICTIMS THAT'S

02:23:05.677 --> 02:23:10.548
IT INSULT. TO THE VICTIM. SO THE

02:23:10.615 --> 02:23:11.983
WE NEED TO REALLY FOCUS THAT

02:23:12.050 --> 02:23:13.952
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT AND IF

02:23:14.018 --> 02:23:15.987
SOMEONE GETS HIDEOUS CORPUS

02:23:16.054 --> 02:23:18.089
BECAUSE OF THIS AND- CONVICTIONS

02:23:18.156 --> 02:23:20.692

WILL HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY

02:23:27.465 --> 02:23:29.233
AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL DO IT THE

02:23:29.300 --> 02:23:31.069
RIGHT WAY AND IF I CAN'T DO IT

02:23:31.135 --> 02:23:32.837

WHERE THESE KIDS ARE GOING AND

02:32:00.644 --> 02:32:03.080
WHY THE PARENTS ARE CHOOSING- TO

TRY TO GET THEIR KIDS EDUCATED

02:32:04.381 --> 02:32:06.217
IN DIFFERENT PLACES THAN WHERE

02:32:06.283 --> 02:32:07.051

SCHOOLS OVER THE LAST COUPLE

02:32:13.524 --> 02:32:15.125
YEARS AND I THINK- AT LEAST IN

02:32:15.192 --> 02:32:17.261
MY DISTRICT AND- PROVOKES I'M

02:32:17.328 --> 02:32:20.030

02:32:20.097 --> 02:32:21.365
THEY WANT SOME MORE OPTIONS AND

02:32:21.432 --> 02:32:22.933
THEY WANT THEIR MONEY TO BE ABLE

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:24.168
TO FOLLOW THEIR CHILDREN TO

02:32:24.235 --> 02:32:26.103
SCHOOLS THAT THEY CHOOSE- IN IN

02:32:26.170 --> 02:32:27.805
THIS BASICALLY IS CONTINUE TO

02:32:27.872 --> 02:32:30.875
KICK THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD AND

02:32:30.941 --> 02:32:33.377

PANDEMIC FOR SOME LONGER BUT BUT

02:32:45.122 --> 02:32:47.591
THE OVER ISSUE IS WHY OUR KIDS

02:32:47.658 --> 02:32:48.526
ARE. AND WHY ARE PARENTS

02:32:48.592 --> 02:32:49.827
CHOOSING OTHER OPTIONS AND THE

02:32:49.894 --> 02:32:51.028
