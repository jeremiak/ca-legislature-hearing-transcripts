INSURANCE SAID TODAY WE HAVE ONLY ONE BELL I DO SEE THAT WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM YET SO WE WILL PROCEED AS A SUBCOMMITTEE WELCOME MR DAILY. YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL. IT WAS ON THE FLOOR AND YOU. VERY KINDLY CALLED IT BACK HERE THIS COMMITTEE SO THAT WE COULD TO SUGGEST SOME AMENDMENTS. BASED ON MY DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU. I INTEND TO MAKE THE FOLLOWING AMENDMENTS WHEN THIS BILL RETURNS TO THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE. TO INCREASE THE MINIMUM NOTICE PERIOD FOR A NON RENEWAL TO SEVENTY FIVE DAYS. TO CLARIFY THAT VERY HIGH FIRE RISKS OWN SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE FARE PLANNED RIGHT OUT CREDIT SYSTEM. AND REQUIRE THE FAIR PLAN REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE ON THE AFFECTING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CHANGES MADE BY THIS BILL TO THAT RIGHT OUT CREDIT SYSTEM. ALSO I'M ASKING TO ADDED URGENCY CLAUSE WHEN THIS BILL GOES TO THE FLOOR. AND WITH ME IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE FAIR PLAN. OF WHO I THINK WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. YES THANK YOU AND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE THE FAIR PLAN SUPPORT TO THE RIGHT OUT CREDIT AREA EXPANSION. THE REASON I'M SUPPORTING THIS IS BECAUSE COMPANIES NEED ANOTHER REASON NEED A GOOD REASON TO WRITE IN AREAS THAT ARE HIGH IN VERY HIGH FIGHTING FIRE DANGER AREAS. AND BY PROVIDING A RIGHT OUT CREDIT FOR WRITING. A HOMEOWNER'S POLICY IN THESE AREAS COMPANIES ACTUALLY ARE GIVEN INCENTIVES RIGHT IN THESE AREAS BECAUSE WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS THEY'RE REDUCING. THE POTENTIAL FOR A LARGE ASSESSMENT IN THE EVENT THAT THE FAIR PLAN NEEDS TO DO AN ASSESSMENT SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY MATTERS QUITE A BIT TO COMPANIES AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD. FRANKLY SUPPORT THE FAIR PLAN. OF WRITING LESS BECAUSE THE VOLUNTARY MARKET WOULD WRITE MORE SO I'M IN FULL SUPPORT OF THE EXPANSION OF THOSE AREAS. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT THIS IS MARGARET WRECKAGE THE ASSEMBLY INSURANCE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT AND I THINK HE'S HERE JUST ANSWER ANY TECH QUESTIONS THAT MAY ARISE IF I MAY I JUST FEEL AS WE DO HAVE A QUORUM SO WE'RE GONNA TAKE. CARL FACE BEFORE WE PROCEED THANK YOU RUBIO. HERE RUBIO PRESENT JONES. ARCHULETA ARCHULETA PRESENT BATES BATES PRESENT BURGESS JUST PRESENT DODD. DOT PRESENT GALGIANI GLAZER HUESO. HUESO PRESENT MITCHELL MORLOCK MORE LIKE PRESENT PORTANTINO ROUGH. GALGIANI ROTH GEN PRESENT. WE DO HAVE. YOU MAY PROCEED I KNOW THAT YOU WERE HERE FOR ANY QUESTIONS ANY MEMBERS MAY HAVE. MISTER MARLAND. JUST IN LAYMAN'S TERMS COULD YOU DEFINE RIGHT OUT CREDIT THANK YOU. ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. QUESTION YES I'M WE TEND TO GET OUT ON THE INSURANCE STUFF SO IF THE FAIR PLAN NEEDS FUNDS TO PAY CLAIMS AFTER CATASTROPHE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO TO THE MEMBER COMPANIES WHICH IS ANY ADMITTED RIDER IN THE MARKET PLACE. ON A MARKET SHARE BASIS AND REQUEST MONEY FROM THEM SO WERE BACKED BY THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WHERE IS THEIR BACK ME SIGA SO IF WE NEED MONEY TO PAY CLAIMS WE GO OUT TO THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND WE ASK FOR MONEY AND THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT EACH INSURANCE COMPANY NEEDS TO. SEND TO THE FAIR PLAN IS BASED ON MARKET SHARE. BUT RIGHT OUT CREDITS CAN. IF YOU WRITE IN CERTAIN AREAS AREAS WHERE WE WANT TO PROVIDE INCENTIVE I II HI IN VERY HIGH FIRE DANGER AREAS. THEY CAN ACTUALLY REDUCE THEIR MARKET SHARE PERCENT. BY WRITING BUSINESS IN THOSE AREAS AND THE REASON THIS IS IMPORTANT AS WE WANT TO GIVE COMPANIES AN INCENTIVE TO WRITE IN THESE AREAS. AND WE ARE CURRENTLY IN A FINANCIAL POSITION TODAY AT THE FAIR PLAN WE ARE SITTING ON ABOUT THIRTY. JUST OVER THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S NOT MUCH MONEY. ONE CATASTROPHE WERE DOING AN ASSESSMENT COMPANIES CARE ABOUT THIS SO ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO GIVE THEM INCENTIVE TO WRITE IN THESE AREAS WHICH WILL THEN REDUCE THE AMOUNT THAT THEY WOULD THEN HAVE TO PAY US. IS A WIN WIN IT HELPS THE CONSUMER BECAUSE THEN THESE COMPANIES WILL WRITE IN THESE AREAS THEY WON'T HAVE TO COME TO THE FAIR PLAN. CERTAINLY HELPS THE COMPANY THAT HAVE TO GIVE LESS MONEY TO THE FAIR PLAN AND CANDIDLY HELPS THE FAIR PLAN WE WRITE FEWER POLICIES WHICH. I WORK IN OPPOSITE WORLD WE'RE TRYING NOT TO WRITE POLICIES SO. AS I EE ITIT'S A WIN WIN SO THOSE RIGHT OUT CREDITS. IT'S AN INCENTIVE FOR COMPANIES TO WRITE IN THESE AREAS WHERE WE WANT THEM TO WRITE. AND THEN. WOULD THEY HAVE TO RAISE THEIR PREMIUMS TO WRITE OUR. KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN LET'S SAY A COMPANY HAS 10% OF THE MARKET SHARE IN STATEWIDE BEFORE WE DO THE ADJUSTMENT FOR THE YEAH RIGHT CREDITS LET'S SAY THEY WRITE A FULL 1% OF THAT 10% PREMIUM IN THESE AREAS. WITHIN REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF AN ASSESSMENT THAT THEY WOULD BE ASKED TO PAY ESTÃ¡N HOW MUCH PREMIUM THEY WRITE IN THOSE AREAS SO AGAIN IT COSTS THEM NOTHING IF ANYTHING COMPANIES WHO ARE ACTIVELY WRITING THESE AREAS WILL BENEFIT. FROM LOWER ASSESSMENTS FROM THE FAIR PLAN. SO IT DOESN'T BUT IT DOESN'T COST ANYBODY ANYTHING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'RE VERY WELCOME. MR DOT. DID YOU HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION QUESTION. ONE A ONE YES THE OTHER MEMBERS. THANK YOU MANAGER OF I AM REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS AND IT IT IS FANTASTIC BECAUSE OF THE FCT THAT WOULD BE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE AFFECTED BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT THE POLICY WOULD WOULD COVER THE DWELLING AND NOT BARNES OUTSIDE AREAS ONLY THE- DWELLING ITSELF IS THAT CORRECT. ARE YOU REFERRING TO THE FAIR PLAN POLICY ITSELF IT JUST DEPENDS ON WHAT IS SCHEDULED ON THE POLICY SO WE CAN COVER OUTBUILDINGS IS ONE OF THE OTHER. YES AND ALSO THE FAIR PLAN DOES GO INTO AREAS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT. PERHAPS THERE'S A MIXED USE THEIR WAR IT'S AN OLDER PROPERTY THAT THE FARMERS ALLSTATE STATE FARM WOULDN'T TOUCH. BUT THE FAIR PLAN WOULD. ARE WE INCREASING THE RATE FOR THEM AND COVER THEM AS WELL. WE WILL WRITE IN THIS IS WHAT I. SAID THIS MORNING AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING THE FAIR PLAN RIGHTS WHAT THE NORMAL INSURANCE MARKET WANT. THAT'S REALLY THE WAY TO LOOK AT IT IF THEY WON'T WRITE IT WE WILL WE ARE THE BACKSTOP IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR PROPERTY INSURANCE THE PURPOSE OF THE FAIR PLAN IS TO MAKE SURE. THAT ANYBODY WITH INSURABLE PROPERTY MEANING THERE'S NO LIKE ON REPAIR DAMAGE IT HASN'T BEEN VACANT FOR TOO LONG THAT THEY CAN IN FACT GET INSURANCE THAT'S THAT'S OUR ROLE IN THE MARKETPLACE. GOOD THANK YOU WELCOME ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. MASTER FORTRESS. THANK YOU JUST A VERY MUCH A BASIC QUESTION. ONE MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A DIRECT NEXUS SO IF THE INSURANCE COMPANY. IS WILLING TO ISSUE POLICIES IN. PRONE AREAS HIGH RISK PRONE AREAS. IN ORDER FOR THEM TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT TAX CREDIT THEY HAVE TO IDENTIFY THAT IT IS FOR THOSE PRONE AREAS THOSE ISOLATED AREAS YOU CAN'T BE DISTRIBUTED ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT SO THE CAL FIRE MAPS OUR GEO CODED AND WE WOULD REQUIRE THAT COMPANIES THEY HAVE TO SUBMIT TO THE FAIR PLAN ON ANNUAL BASIS. OF WHAT ARE CALLED RIGHT CREDITS WE ACTUALLY GET POLICY LEVEL INFORMATION AND WE WOULD THEN CONFIRM THAT EACH POLICY THAT THEY SENT US DATA FOR IS IN FACT. WITHIN THOSE AREAS BASED ON YOUR COAT. GREAT SO HOW IS THE EVALUATION OF THE TAX CREDIT. BORN INTO IN CALCULATED BY THE INSURANCE PROVIDERS IS THERE ANY DEGREE OF OVERSIGHT THAT WERE EXPECTING TO BE DONE BY FAIR THAT WOULD IDENTIFY THAT. THIS IS COMMENSURATE WITH THE TAX INSTEAD OF THE RECEIVING I'D I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANY TAX INCENTIVE THAT THEY'D BE RECEIVING WATCHING ME THE CREDIT EXCUSE ME YET WE WOULD WE WOULD VALIDATE THAT. SO EVERYBODY HAS TO SUBMIT DATA TO US ON AN ANNUAL BASIS IF THEY SO CHOOSE NOW RIGHT CREDITS OF COURSE ARE. A BENEFIT TO THE COMPANY BUT I'M NOT ALL COMPANIES CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE WERE HOPING CANDIDLY THAT THE EXPANSION OF THESE AREAS WILL INCENTIVIZE MORE COMPANIES TO NOT ONLY WRITE IN THESE AREAS BUT THEN CENTERS THAT DATA BUT THEN WE WOULD VALIDATE THAT DATE. NOW IN LLOYDS OF LONDON. DID THEY CONTRIBUTE TO. THE FAIR PLAN OR THE INSURANCE GUARANTY ASSOCIATION. DO YOU MEAN VIS A VIS AN ASSESSMENT OR MY QUESTION IS SOME OF THE LAST FOLKS THAT USED TO ISSUE POLICIES AND HE'S PRONE AREAS AND I ONLY JUST BRING OUT AND TOTALING. LLOYDS OF LONDON WERE THEY PARTICIPATING IN IN THESE PROGRAMS THE ONLY THE ONLY COMPANIES THAT PARTICIPATE IN THIS ARE THE- A LIMITED INSURANCE COMPANIES SO LLOYDS OF LONDON IS NOT AN ADMITTED INSURANCE COMPANY SCOTTSDALE AND VOIGTS LONDON WERE NOT. CORRECT SO THE LAST TWO ISSUING AND- THE FOOT HILL MOUNTAIN TERRITORIES MY UNDERSTANDING. THAT THAT COULD BE I AM THE FAIR PLAN OF COURSE THEM OKAY LAST QUESTION IS HOW DO SOMETHING AT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND START IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE I GET UPDATED. IF YOU DID MANAGE TO GO UP TO MILLION FIVE. AND THE GOOD NEWS IS WE ARE INCREASING OUR LIMITS TO THREE MILLION. WERE YOU SHIFTING GEARS TO THE GUARANTEE ASSOCIATION WHICH IS HERE. COLLEGES FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO A MILLION. FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO A MILLION FOR PURPOSES OF HOMES PLUS THE ADDITIONAL ALIY AND CONTENTS SO IT'S ACTUALLY A HIGHER THAN A MILLION NUMBER AND HOW TO TAKE ALL THE WAY UNTIL NOW FOR ANYBODY SAID. THAT DOESN'T WORK FOR HOMEOWNERS IN CALIFORNIA ANYMORE I THINK TO BE HONEST WITH YOU MERCED CASUALLY TO HENDERSON PERCENT CASUALTY TO FOR US TO FIGURE THAT OUT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS BY MEMBERS. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THAT AFTERNOON ANNA BACK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IN SUPPORT WE SEE THIS AS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE THAT WILL INCREASE STERN INSURANCE AVAILABILITY IN OUR STATE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON STACY HE WROTE COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA R. C. R. C. ALSO IN SUPPORT AND WE ALSO SUPPORT THE PROPOSED SEVENTY FIVE DAY AMENDMENT AS WELL. THANK YOU. YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON SIR AND TELL THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION CALIFORNIA. WE UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES THE HOMEOWNERS ARE FACING IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL WITH THE SIXTY DAY NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT. AND WHILE SEVENTY FIVE DAYS WOULD PUT CALIFORNIA ON THE OUTER EDGES OF THE TIME FRAME NATIONALLY. WE RESPECT THE INTENTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE AUTHOR AND THAT DOES NOT CHANGE OPPOSITION. MADAM CHAIR-MEMBERS YOUR MEMBERS ABOUT THE AMERICAN PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE ASSOCIATION WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF THE SIXTY DAYS FOR THE NOTICE PERIOD THE SEVENTY FIVE DAYS MISTER TAYLOR SAID PUTS US ON THE OUTER LIMIT LITTLE BIT HARDER FOR MEMBERSHIP BUT WE UNDERSTAND THE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA SO WE REMAIN. IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. IS THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. IS THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OKAY SO I DO UNDERSTAND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE ONCE SAID TESTIFY AT NIGHT I'M UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY YOU'RE NOT TAKING A POSITION BE ONE ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES. GO AHEAD THANK YOU. COULD SEE. GOOD AFTERNOON MIKE MARTINEZ RUBIO FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME BRIEFLY TESTIFY HERE IT IS TRUE THE DEPARTMENT AND IN TRANSMISSION DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE A POSITION ON THIS RECENT VERSION OF THE BILL. WE HAVE A PREVIEW OF THE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF ON THIS MEASURES IT CONTINUES TO MOVE FOR THERE ARE THREE ELEMENTS. TO THIS BILL. THAT WE DO A VARYING DEGREES OF PERSPECTIVE ON. SO THE FIRST THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED IS THE INCREASE FROM FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND LIMIT TO ONE MILLION. WE DO SUPPORT THE ELEMENT OF THE BILL WE THINK THAT IS CERTAINLY LONG OVERDUE. AND AGREED TO THE RECENT MERCED CASUALTY INSOLVENCY THAT WE SAW. LAST YEAR WAS REALLY WAS. OF THE MOST RECENT EVENT TO OCCUR THAT UNDERSCORED THE INSUFFICIENT. LEVEL THAT. FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND WOULD HAVE FOR MANY HOME PROPERTIES IN CALIFORNIA WHOSE REPLACEMENT VALUE IN INSURANCE COVERAGE EXCEEDS THAT CAP UP AGAIN AT THAT POINT IN TIME SO WE SUPPORT THAT ELEMENT OF THE BILL. ONE OTHER ITEM IS THAT THE SB NINE A ONE COMMISSION ON CATASTROPHIC WHILE FOR COST RECOVERY ALSO RECOMMENDED THE INCREASE FROM FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ONE MILLION. IN ITS JUNE TWO TWENTY NINETEEN REPORT FROM EARLIER THIS YEAR SO WANTED CAN BE THAT DOCTORS THAT PARITY. SECOND ELEMENT IS THE FAIR PLAN RIGHT OFF WE ARE GENERALLY SUPPORT OF THE INTENT OF THAT WE ARE A AND HAVE BEEN TALKING ON THE AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD BE COMING OUT. ON THE BILL AND AS THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS BRIEFLY POINTS OUT ON PAGE FIVE. OF THAT INSURERS THAT THERE ARE YOU KNOW POTENTIAL CONCERN THAT INSURERS COULD CHERRY PICKED THEIR CREDIT SOME SHOW A PREFERENCE FOR HIGH RISK AREAS OVER VERY HIGH RISK AREAS AND SO AS A RESULT THE DEPARTMENT WILL MONITOR AND REVIEW. INFORMATION FROM THE FAIR PLAN ON HOW THE RIGHT OUT CREDITS ARE USING THE NEW SYSTEM PROPOSED IN THIS BILL BY ENSURING ONLY THE LOWEST RISK WE REALLY WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT. THE INTENT BETTER THE AUTHOR HAD HAD SET OUT. IS ACTUALLY IT'S ULTIMATELY ACHIEVED IN THIS PARTICULAR ELEMENT OF THE BILL SO AGAIN THAT'S SOMETHING NOT. AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD AND IT'S CLEARLY WITH THE FAIR PLAN REPORTING BACK. THAT WE AS THE INSURANCE REGULATORY WILL CERTAINLY LOOK TO. TWO WOULD VERIFY AND ENSURE THAT THAT DATA IS UP STANDING INCISIONS REPORTED TO THE DEPARTMENT. AND THEN THE THIRD ELEMENT OF THE BILL THE THIRD AND LAST IS THE NON RENEWALS AND THE DEPARTMENT COMMISSIONER WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE GENERAL DIRECTION. OF THE BILL WITH HOPEFULLY MORE TO GO WE UNDERSTAND WE APPRECIATE. THE AUTHOR AND- ACCEPTING NOW THE SEVENTY FIVE DAY NOTICE AMENDMENT AS PROPOSED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT TIME FOR CONSUMERS TO SHOP THE THING THAT ARE A DYNAMIC THAT THE COMMISSION THE DEPARTMENT IN THE MANY. A TOWN HALL MEETINGS THAT WE ARE HAVING THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND HAVE HAD THESE LAST SEVERAL. MONTHS IS THAT IT'S A POINT OF CONSIDERATION IS THAT AS MUCH TIME THAT THE THAT WE BELIEVE THE CONSUMER SHOULD HAVE SHOULD THEY BE NON RENEWED OR THE NOTICE OF. NON RENEWAL IS GIVEN TO THAT POLICY HOLDER THAT WE WANT THEM TO HAVE SUFFICIENT TIME OR AS MUCH TIME AS POSSIBLE TO. BE ABLE TO SHOP FOR ALTERNATIVE INSURANCE POLICIES IN THE ADMITTED MARKET PLACE AMONG THE SURPLUS LINES OR AMONG THE FAIR PLAN. THERE'S ANOTHER ASPECT THAT ADDITIONAL TIME WOULD GIVE IS ACTUALLY TO BE ABLE TO GIVE TIME. TO THAT HOMEOWNER TO MITIGATE THEIR PROPERTY THAT SOME INDIVIDUALS MAY NOT KNOW THAT IT'S ALSO THE TO TAKE THE TIME TO SHOP. FOR AN ALTERNATIVE POLICY IT'S ALSO TIME FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO MITIGATE THEIR PROPERTY REMOVE TREES OR BRUSH AND ACT STRUCTURAL REPAIRS. MOVE PROPANE TAKES AWAY FROM THE HOME REPLACE ATTACK WITH NON COMBUSTIBLE MATERIALS AND CLOSE THE VENTS THIS THAT TAKES TIME. AND AT TIMES THAT OF CURRENT. UNDER EXISTING LAW FORTY FIVE DAYS CAN BE. ON A INSUFFICIENT AND THAT'S WHERE YOU DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR FOR WANTING TO EXTEND AMOUNTS FROM SIXTY DAYS AS PROPOSED IN THE BILL TO NOW SEVENTY FIVE BUT THAT WE ALSO FEEL THAT THERE SHOULD BE MORE TIME THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER AND THAT THE COMMISSIONERS ALSO HAS BEEN PROPOSING ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS TO BE CONSIDERED SO THAT'S WHERE WE WANTED AT LEAST CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE ON THIS PARTICULAR ELEMENT. BUT IN ALL WE DO APPRECIATE THE BILL TO MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU. KILL AS THERE ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO THIS EXPRESSED CONCERNS I KNOW WE HAVE. A TWEENER A CD I ANYBODY ELSE I JUST WANT TO SHARE THE CONCERNS. NOW. OKAY WITHOUT MEMBERS ANY OTHER FURTHER QUESTIONS. SO WHAT THANK YOU SO MUCH CAN YOU PLEASE EXPRESSED TO OUR INSURANCE COMMISSIONER THAT THAT WE APPRECIATE HIS CONCERNS AND DOWN JUST FOR EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND MISTER DATING I DID SIT DOWN WE DID DISCUSS ALL THE CONCERNS AND DIE AND I KNOW THAT FOR US WE WERE. TRYING TO DO SOMETHING NOW TO TRY AND HELP SOME OF THOSE FOLKS THAT ARE STRUGGLING AND WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO HAVING DISCUSSIONS FURTHER IN THE COMING MONTHS TO ADDRESS THAT THE NUMBER OF DAYS BUT THE REASON WE WENT FROM A- SIXTY TO SEND IF I WANTED TO ADD ANOTHER MONTH FOR FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO SHOP AROUND AND I KNOW IT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT EVERYONE WANTED BUT- IT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION SO I FELT THAT. AT LEAST FOR NOW I WANTED TO GO THAT EXTRA MONTH AND SO WITH THAT FEES WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE MISTER DAILY JUST TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE. COMMENTS AND FOR YOUR COOPERATION. WE ARE COMMITTEE STAFFS CORPORATION WE HAD A TWO HOUR HEARING THIS MORNING ON THE FAIR PLAN AND ONE OF THE INTERESTING POINTS THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE FAIR PLAN MADE IS THAT MANY FOLKS WHO. BUY INTO THE FAIR PLAN WITHIN MONTHS. UGH CONTINUE SHOPPING AND BUY ANOTHER POLICY AND DROP THE FAIR PLAN SO IT IS A PLAN OF LAST RESORT BUT IS NOT NECESSARILY PERMANENT NOR IS IT ALWAYS IDEAL FOR THE HOMEOWNER BUT IT IS THERE AS A AS A PRODUCT OF LAST RESORT SO IT'S SO IT'S WORKING PRETTY WELL I HOPE THAT THESE TWO WEEKS WILL MAKE IT WORK EVEN BETTER.
