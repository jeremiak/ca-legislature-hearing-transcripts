THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TODAY TO PRESENT MY BUDGET REQUEST WHICH WILL ALLOCATE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. FOR EXPANSION IN ADMINISTRATION OF THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL SERGEANT SHRIVER'S CIVIL COUNCIL ACT PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS ARE ADMINISTERED BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND OPERATED BY LEGAL SERVICES NONPROFITS WORKING IN COLLABORATIONS WITH LOCAL COURTS. THE SEARCH SHRIVER PROGRAM PROVIDES LEAK VITAL LEGAL REPRESENTATION TO LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS IN LIFE CHANGING CIVIL LEGAL MATTERS. IN MANY CASES HAVING AN ATTORNEY CAN BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAVING A HOME ARE BEING AFFECTED GAINING OR LOSING CUSTODY OF A CHILD OR SECURING A GARDEN. YOUR GUARDIAN OR CONSERVATORSHIP FOR LOVE. ONE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL RELEASED AN EVALUATION WHICH FOUND THAT THESE PROGRAMS NOT ONLY DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED OUTCOMES FOR LITIGANTS. BUT ALSO THAT THEY INCREASE SETTLEMENTS REDUCE COSTS ON THE COURT SYSTEM AND PROVIDED NUMEROUS OTHER EFFICIENCIES. IN SHORT THE EVALUATION DEMONSTRATED THAT THE SHRIVER PROGRAM HELPS LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA SECURE ACCESS TO JUSTICE. IT CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES THE URGENT NEED TO SCALE TRIVERS PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. FUNDING HAS BEEN AND REMAINS AN ISSUE FOR THESE PROGRAMS. FUNDED BY CERTAIN CIVIL FILING FEES THE SHRIVER PROGRAMS HAVE RECEIVED LESS MONEY EACH YEAR AS CIVIL FILINGS HAVE DECREASED. ORIGINALLY PROJECTED TO HAVE ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY THE SHRIVER PROGRAMS ONLY RECEIVED ABOUT FOUR FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION IN THE 200-017-2000 EIGHTEEN FISCAL YEAR. INSTEAD OF EXPANDING THEIR SERVICES SHRIVER ACT PROGRAMS OF HAD TO SCALE BACK THE NUMBER OF CASES THEY CAN ACCEPT AND FOREGO CREATING NEW PROGRAMS IN OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE. INVESTING IN THIS WHERE THE PROGRAM ALLOW MORE CALIFORNIANS IN MORE PARTS OF THE STATE TO ACCESS JUSTICE. THE INFLUX OF THIS MONEY WILL HELP SERVE MORE LOW INCOME LITIGANTS ALLOW PROGRAMS TO HELP OTHER UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS. EXPAND SERVICES TO OTHER CRITICAL AREAS SUCH AS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND ESTABLISH NEW PROGRAMS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE.% I JUST WANNA SAY THE THE FUNDAMENTAL THESIS BEHIND THIS BILL IS THAT JUSTICE SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY IN THE STATE. REGARDLESS OF YOUR INCOME AND REGARDLESS OF YOUR ABILITY TO AFFORD AN ATTORNEY AND WE SEE IN SO MANY AREAS THE LAW THAT HAVING AN ATTORNEY OR NOT HAVING ATTORNEY IS REALLY OUTCOME DETERMINATIVE AND SO FOR THE THE THE CALIFORNIANS OF THE LEAST MEANS THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES THEM. WITH ATTORNEYS AND WE'VE SEEN THAT THAT'S MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THEIR CASES AND IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN A BENEFIT TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND HAS SAVE THE STATE MONEY. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION OF THIS REQUEST WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE WHERE HE MAY HAVE. AND WITH ME TO TESTIFY IS GERRY SMITH THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF LEGAL SERVICES OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS MADAM CHAIR. THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR LEGAL SERVICE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE PROVIDE FREE CIVIL LEGAL SERVICES IN TWENTY THREE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES AND WE ARE ONE OF THE TEN SHRIVER CIVIL COUNCIL. PROJECTS WHICH WE OPERATE. UNDER THE UNDER THE PARTNERSHIP OF DEAL COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT IN OUR OFFICE IN -- WOODLAND. BY I THINK THAT -- IT BEARS EMPHASISED THAT THIS HAS BEEN ALWAYS A BI PARTISAN PROJECT. GOVERNOR SCHWARTZ AND I SCHWARZENEGGER SIGNED A. B. FIVE NINETY IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE AND NAMED AFTER HIS FATHER IN LAW [inaudible] TO REMOTE THE THE THE IDEA OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN THE COURTS OF CALIFORNIA. THE PROJECT HAS RECEIVED NATIONAL ATTENTION AND RECOGNITION AS A POLICY INITIATIVE TOWARDS A VISION OF COMPREHENSIVE ACCESS TO JUSTICE. OUR PROGRAM IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LA COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT IS BEEN OPERATING THIS PROJECT SINCE TWENTY TWELVE AND HAS ASSISTED OVER TWO THOUSAND TENANTS. SINCE THAT TIME OUR CLIENTS INCLUDE PEOPLE WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OLDER ADULTS VETERANS AND PEOPLE WITH SIGNIFICANT DISABILITIES IN HERE'S HOW THE YOLO COUNTY PRESIDING JUDGE. RECENTLY DESCRIBED THIS PROJECT QUOTE IT IMPROVES ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR UNLAWFUL DETAINER LITIGANTS BY REDUCING THE DISPARITY THAT EXISTS IN REPRESENTATION IN A FICTION CASES. IT PROVIDES LANGUAGE ACCESS FOR LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT LITIGANTS IT ENCOURAGES SETTLEMENT THROUGH MEDIATION AND OFFERS NEUTRAL EXPERT WITNESS TESTIMONY IN CASES INVOLVING SUBSTANDARD. HOUSING AND IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL HAS POINTED OUT THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN SCRUPULOUSLY ADMINISTERED BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND RIGOROUSLY EVALUATED BY AN INDEPENDENT OF VALUE. EVALUATOR WITH -- IMPERIAL IT EMPIRICALLY DOCUMENTED POSITIVE RESULTS AND I WOULD URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS -- WE HAVE SOMEONE WANTS TO JUST GIVE THE NAME AND SAY THEY SUPPORT YES. MADAM TURN MEMBER SYLVIA SOLELY SHAUN BEHALF OF LOS ANGELES CITY ATTORNEY MIKE FEWER AUTHOR OF THE IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION PROGRAM HAS A SUCCESSFUL TRACK RECORD AND WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BUDGET REQUEST THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS AND THE LEGAL AID SOCIETY I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE DIFFERENCE OF THE DIFFERENT JURISDICTION -- EQUAL ACCESS. THE EQUAL ACCESS -- ONE MADAM CHAIR -- GENERALLY FUNDS CIVIL LEGAL SERVICES FOR POOR PEOPLE AND AND THERE ARE OVER ONE HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS THEY GET THAT. MONEY THAT FUNDING THE SHRIVER PROJECT IS A VERY SPECIFIC PROGRAM AND THERE ARE TEN OF THEM NOW IN THE STATE. ALL OF THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT RECEIVE SHRIVER PROJECT ARE ALSO RECIPIENTS OF THE EQUAL ACCESS FUNDING BUT THIS IS SPECIFIC DESIGNATED FUNDS TO DO PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COURTS. TO TRY AND LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD IN CERTAIN SUBJECT AREAS LIKE HOUSING CUSTODY IN AND OTHER FAMILY WOMEN IN THE WAY THAT WAS DESCRIBED IN THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION IS A LIFE CHANGING CIVIL LEGAL MATTERS SO THESE ARE CASES WHERE THERE IS THE MOST ON THE LINE FOR FOLKS THEY'RE FACING. THE POSSIBILITY OF INFECTION THERE FACING THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING CUSTODY OF A CHILD THE TYPE OF THINGS AND HAVE A DRAMATIC IMPACT ON ONE'S LIFE. AND IT'S FOCUSED ON FOLKS OR SO IT'S THE MOST LOW INCOME FOLKS IN THE HIGH STAKES CASES OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I THINK WE HAVE MISTER RAMOS HERE WE CATION -- HE DID ON THE OTHER ONE HE WAY THAT PRESENTATION YES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND A MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT A REQUEST FOR TEN MILLION DOLLARS.

SO WE NEED TO START TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND MOVE FORWARD IN REQUESTING THESE TYPES OF GRANTS IN FRONT OF US TODAY. AND WILL CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE ON THESE NEEDS. THIS BUDGET REQUEST PROVIDES FOCUSES ON PROVIDING TRIBES THE RESOURCES TO CONNECT WITH YOU. TO PROVIDE THEM THE RESOURCES THEY NEED AND TO DIVERT AWAY FROM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.

SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION THANK YOU CHAIR. ITEM ISSUE NUMBER. TWO WHICH IS THE FUNDING FOR THE STANDARDS AND TRAINING FOR THE LOCAL CORRECTION A WHEN ASKED YOU TO COME FIFTY TWO HELLO. YES PLEASE THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND KATIE HOWARD THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS. ON THE PROPOSAL IS OUTLINED HERE IN YOUR AGENDA MY COLLEAGUE YVONNE GARNER SHE'S THEY DIVISION DIRECTOR OF OUR STANDARDS AND TRAINING FOR CORRECTIONS DIVISION HAS JUST A COUPLE COMMENTS ON THE PROPOSAL FOR YOU THANK YOU. SO THIS REQUEST IS FOR A SIX POINT TWO MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IN ONGOING FUNDING FOR TRAINING FOR CORRECTIONS STAFF WORKING IN PROBATION JUVENILE FACILITIES AND JAILS. THE FUNDING SUPPORTS THE INCREASED TRAINING NEEDS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL RESULTING FROM THE MORE COMPLEX SUPER VISION MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS THAT REQUIRE THOSE OFFICERS TO HAVE MORE AND BETTER TRAINING. TO SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY PERFORM THEIR JOBS. THE BOARD IS REQUIRED BY STATUTE TO SET MINIMUM TRAINING STANDARDS FOR CORRECTION STAFF WE RECENTLY COMPLETED A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THOSE STANDARDS AND BROUGHT TOGETHER MANY SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT WORK GROUPS. TO ASSESS THE TRAINING STANDARDS IDENTIFY GAPS AND MAKE CHANGES WERE NECESSARY. IN JANUARY THE BOARD APPROVED OF THOSE NEW TRAINING SANDERS AND THEY INCLUDE TRAINING IN CRITICAL AREAS LIKE MENTAL HEALTH. DE ESCALATION TRAUMA INFORMED CARE GENDER IDENTIFICATION AND SEXUAL ABUSE AND ASSAULT. BUT THESE TRAINING OR THESE INCREASE TRAINING PARLIAMENTS COME ON THE HEELS OF RECENT REDUCTIONS THE PROGRAM SENDING STEMMING FROM DECLINING REVENUES IN THE STATE PENALTY FUND. THIS REQUEST HELP TO BRIDGE THAT GAP AND PROVIDE SOME ASSISTANCE TO CORRECTIONS AGENCIES IN MEETING THE STATE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS REQUEST THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS FROM FINANCE. HELLO AGAIN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CAITLYN O'NEILL WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. I DESPITE RECENT DECLINES AND FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM WE FOUND THAT COMPLIANCE RATES WITH THE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS ARE QUITE HIGH. TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ONLY FORTY SEVEN OUT OF THIRTY THREE THOUSAND ELIGIBLE OFFICERS FAILED TO MEET THEIR REQUIRED TRAINING AMOUNT UNDER THE PROGRAM. SO IT DOES APPEAR THAT PROVIDING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES UNDER THE EXISTING -- DISBURSEMENT FORMULA AS HIS PROPOSED -- WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE PAYING AGENCIES MORE TO DO WHAT THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH ALREADY DOING -- SO IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE A MEANINGFUL IMPACT ON TRAINING. IN ADDITION THE BOARD DOESN'T COLLECT DATA ON THE TYPES OF TRAINING THAT OFFICERS ARE PURSUING TO MEET THEIR ANNUAL TRAINING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE PROGRAM. SO IT'S NOT FULLY CLEAR AT THIS TIME WHAT TYPES OF TRAINING ARE BEING SUPPORTED BY THE PROGRAM. SO WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THE PROPOSAL GIVEN THAT IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT TO HAVE A THAT IT WOULD HAVE A MEANINGFUL IMPACT ON TRAINING. I IN ADDITION WE RECOMMEND DIRECTING THE BSE SEE TO BEGIN COLLECTING DATA ON THE TYPES OF TRAINING THAT OFFICERS ARE COMPLETING AS A PART OF THE PROGRAM. BECAUSE WE THINK THAT THIS INFORMATION WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE WHEN MAKING DECISIONS ON THIS PROGRAM IN THE FUTURE. HOWEVER IF THE IN THE MEANTIME IF THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO ACCOMPLISH A PARTICULAR GOAL IN IN THE NEAR TERM AND FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY IT COULD. CREATE A SEPARATE GRANT PROGRAM -- THAT IS MORE TARGETED AND LIMITED TERM. OKAY. ANY OF QUESTIONS [inaudible] COMMENTS. DID YOU EVER SPONSOR OF THE ANY OF THE ISSUES. I WOULD JUST WANT TO CLARIFY WE DO COLLECT DATA FROM EACH AND EVERY PARTICIPATING AGENCY ON PARTICIPATION WE ACTUALLY DO MONITOR COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS -- ANYONE CAN EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT HOW WHAT THE OROVILLE WHICH OF COURSE WE'RE HAPPY TO SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE RIGHT AND THAT THE INFORMATION OF THE DATE DATA THAT WAS BEING REFERRED TO BY THE LA -- IS THAT A TYPE OF A TRAINING THAT IS USED TO COMPLETE THE ANNUAL TRAINING REQUIREMENTS ONLY SEVEN HOURLY TRAINING REQUIREMENT FOR THAT. AND WE LEAVE THE CONTENT TO BE DETERMINED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE THEY ARE MUCH MORE PREPARED TO IDENTIFY SAID WITH THE LOCAL PRIORITIES ARE THE AGENCY REQUIREMENTS ARE. AS WELL AS WITH THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF THE EMPLOYEE ARE. SO WE ALLOW THOSE DECISIONS TO BE MADE WE DO HAVE -- LOCALLY AND WE DO HAVE A CERTIFICATION SYSTEM SO WE COULD RUN QUERIES BECAUSE EVERY COURSE HAS TO BE CERTIFIED OF OUR SYSTEM TO IDENTIFY WHERE IS TRAINING OCCURRING ACROSS THE STATE WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TYPE BACK TO THE INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE. BUT WE CAN SEE SAID WHAT TRAINING IS OCCURRING AND WE REQUIRES PART OF THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS THAT IT BE RELATED TO THE JOB SO THEY HAVE TO SORT OF BUILD THAT BRIDGE BETWEEN THE TRAINING THAT THEY RECEDING. TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT AND THE NEEDS OF THE JOB [inaudible] OKAY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU HELLO. THE COMMENTS I'M SORRY. PUBLIC COMMENTS WILL BE BRIEF GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS DANIEL SANCHEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA AND VERY STRONG SUPPORT -- PROBATION DOES OUR CORN ANNUAL TRAINING THROUGH THIS PROGRAM THIS REALLY IS A IN OUR EYES KIND OF A RESTORATION -- A FUNDING FROM PREVIOUS YEARS AS WE HAVE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT CLIENT DECLINE -- OF SEVERAL MILLION SO WE APPRECIATE THIS COMMITTEES -- HISTORICAL WORK -- TO INVEST IN STC AND WE CERTAINLY HOPE. THAT AS DISCUSSIONS GO FOR IT FOR THAT CONSIDERATION THIS YEAR THANK YOU THANK YOU. BUT I'M SURE NUMBERS COURCELLES ALONG WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION HERE IN SUPPORT. OF THE INCREASE REQUIREMENTS FOR TRAINING UNDER THE REEVALUATION THAT BSE HAS DONE WITH THE HELP OF PRACTITIONERS IN THE FIELD ACROSS MANY DISCIPLINES -- AND IN THE CONTEXT OF HAVING FUNDING FOR ADDITIONAL TRAINING -- AS WE SUPPORTER FOR POSTING AS THIS COMMITTEE HAS SUPPORTED IN THE PAST WERE APPRECIATIVE OF THE OPPORTUNITY HERE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU I THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER COMMENTS YES.

BUT CAREFUL THIS ONE DOWN YOU MIGHT AS WELL HERE. OKAY -- WELL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN YEAH I HAD A TO PRESENT A BILL IN AND REVVING TAX AND APPRECIATE YOU GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO PRESENT ON THE SIDE AND BOTTOM LINE WE'RE ASKING FOR SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND THE OBJECTIVE HERE IS TO GET -- THIRTY EIGHT MEDICAL OR MENTAL HEALTH BEDS IN THE BUTTE COUNTY JAIL. YOUR POST REALIGNMENT WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT -- THAT IS -- TO PROVIDE THOSE THOSE RESOURCES -- THE BEAT CAN'T BE COUNTED RECEIVED FORTY MILLION -- THROUGH THE THE SEC -- FUNDS -- BUT WITH THE CONSTRUCTION COSTS THAT HAVE RISEN BOTH. STATE WHY BUT ALSO BECAUSE THE DISASTERS WE'VE HAD IT OR A BILL IN THE CAMPFIRE. ACOSTA INCREASE GREATLY SORE ASKING FOR SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO MAKE SURE WE CAN BUILD THESE. BILL THESE MUCH NEEDED BEDS AND I DO HAVE THE BE COUNTY SHERIFF -- HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OKAY THANK YOU. MAN CHARM. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS ACTUALLY THE PRIMARY SO I CAME HERE TO VISIT. SO -- SINCE THE RATHER BILLS THAT -- CERTAINLY -- WERE WORTHY OF SUPPORT OF THIS ONE THOUGH OF COURSE THERE DURING MY HEART IS YOU KNOW WE RECEIVED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS A FUNDING THROUGH THE EIGHT SIXTY THREE PROGRAM. WITH A MATCH A FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION WE WERE GONNA BILL TO BUILD A FACILITY THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF THE INMATE POPULATION THAT WE SERVE POST AB -- ONE NINE MY COUNTY EMBRACED AB ONE OH NINE WE WORKED HARD TO IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS. THAT WERE DESIGNED TO DEAL WITH A DIFFERENT INMATE POPULATION -- DESIGNED TO DEAL WITH THEIR COMMISSIONING NEEDS AND PROVIDE EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS. EVERYTHING WAS GOING ALONG QUITE WELL UNTIL THE CAMPFIRE AND AFTER THE CAMPFIRE -- WHEN WE START OF WHAT LOOKING AT WHAT IT WAS GONNA COST TO BUILD OF THE FACILITY THAT WE NEED -- WE REALIZE THAT WE WERE ABOUT SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS SHORT. I'M TOLD THAT THE REASON FOR THAT IS THE ANTICIPATED INCREASE THE COST OF LABOR -- RIGHT NOW -- THERE IS VERY LITTLE IN THE WAY OF HOUSING BUTTE COUNTY -- WE DON'T HAVE MUCH LODGING AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BRING CONSTRUCTION -- WORKERS FROM OUT OF THE AREA -- I'M TOLD THAT IN ORDER TO BE COMPETITIVE FOR A HALF PAY ABOVE PREVAILING WAGE AS WELL AS A PROVIDE HOUSING AND SUBSISTENCE FOR THOSE WORKERS -- THAT'S THE ONE OF THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THE INCREASE BUT REGRETTABLY BUTTE COUNTY HAS BEEN NO STRANGER -- TO NATURAL DISASTERS THAT HAVE BECAUSE IN US TO HAVE THESE KIND OF PROBLEMS THE OROVILLE DAM SPILLWAYS. OF BEING ONE OF THEM THE BOTTOM LINE IS AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE THAT KNOWS CAN LAY THE DAY I WANNA MAKE IT FAST. THE BOTTOM LINE IS -- WE'RE LOOKING -- TO EXPANDER DEVELOP A FACILITY IN BUTTE COUNTY THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF THE INMATE POPULATION DAY AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE HANDOUT THAT I PROVIDED YOU -- THIS WOULD BE PAGE ONE WAS IS THE PROPOSED UP -- PROJECT THAT -- WAS ULTIMATELY -- THE WE WE ALSO RECEIVE THE FUNDING FOR IF YOU GO TO PAGE TWO THIS ILLUSTRATES SOME OF THE NEED.
