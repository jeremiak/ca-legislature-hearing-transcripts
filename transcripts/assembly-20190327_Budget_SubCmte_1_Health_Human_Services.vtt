I THINK MY ROLE IS TO TALK ABOUT

00:40:37.368 --> 00:40:38.803
THESE THINGS FROM -- TRIPLE A

00:40:38.869 --> 00:40:39.637
PERSPECTIVE.

00:40:39.703 --> 00:40:43.073
SO ED DID A NICE JOB -- AS HAS

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:44.141
THE REST OF THE APARTMENT OF AB

00:40:44.208 --> 00:40:46.243
DESCRIBING THE SITUATION IN THE

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:47.611
PROCESS OF THE PROCESS SOUNDS A

00:40:47.678 --> 00:40:49.680
LITTLE CONVOLUTED BUT ACTUALLY

00:40:49.747 --> 00:40:51.148
WORKS REALLY WELL.

00:40:51.215 --> 00:40:53.317
BECAUSE IT'S TAKING INPUT FOR

00:40:53.384 --> 00:40:55.886
THE STATE PLAN FROM ALL AREAS IN

00:40:55.953 --> 00:40:57.421
ONE OF THE BEST THINGS ABOUT HOW

00:40:57.488 --> 00:40:58.689
THE SERVICES WORK.

00:40:58.756 --> 00:41:01.125
IS FEDERAL GUIDELINES WITH LOCAL

00:41:01.192 --> 00:41:03.627
CONTROL THAT IS SO IMPORTANT AND

00:41:03.694 --> 00:41:05.362
SO EFFECTIVE BECAUSE PROVIDING

00:41:05.429 --> 00:41:06.430
SERVICES.

00:41:06.497 --> 00:41:09.133
IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES IS VERY

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.601
DIFFERENT THAN AND RULE SAN

00:41:10.668 --> 00:41:12.636
BENITO COUNTY CELL OF THE ACT

00:41:12.703 --> 00:41:14.171
ALLOWS FOR THAT FLEXIBILITY IN

00:41:14.238 --> 00:41:15.639
THAT LOCAL EXPERTISE TO MAKE

00:41:15.706 --> 00:41:16.140
SURE.

00:41:16.207 --> 00:41:18.075
THE SERVICES ARE USED AS

00:41:18.142 --> 00:41:19.310
EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE.

00:41:19.376 --> 00:41:21.846
I'M A COUPLE THINGS ABOUT ME.

00:41:21.912 --> 00:41:24.548
AND AND HOW WE DOCUMENT THAT.

00:41:24.615 --> 00:41:26.584
I'M JUST THE SHEER GROWTH OF THE

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:29.420
POPULATION IS IMPACTING TRIPLE

00:41:29.486 --> 00:41:31.155
A.'S EXTREMELY HARD AND

00:41:31.222 --> 00:41:33.090
UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE NOT DEALING

00:41:33.157 --> 00:41:34.959
WITH A POPULATION THAT FOR THE

00:41:35.025 --> 00:41:37.061
MOST PART IS AGING AND TO WELL.

00:41:37.127 --> 00:41:38.162
THAT WOULD MAKE THINGS SO MUCH

00:41:38.229 --> 00:41:40.164
EASIER BUT CALIFORNIA HAS THE

00:41:40.231 --> 00:41:42.032
GREATEST PERCENTAGE OF SENIORS

00:41:42.099 --> 00:41:44.335
IN GREATEST NUMBER OF SENIORS

00:41:44.401 --> 00:41:46.337
LIVING IN POVERTY.

00:41:46.403 --> 00:41:48.305
ARM ONE IN SIX ARE ALSO LIVING

00:41:48.372 --> 00:41:49.340
ALONE AND LIVING ALONE HAS A

00:41:49.406 --> 00:41:52.042
HUGE IMPACT ON HEALTH AND IT'S A

00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:54.311
GREAT HEALTH PREDICTOR -- IT'S

00:41:54.378 --> 00:41:55.980
BEEN COMPARED THAT TO LIVING

00:41:56.046 --> 00:41:57.581
ALONE IN BEING ISOLATED IS

00:41:57.648 --> 00:41:59.984
EQUIVALENT TO A SMOKING HALF A

00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:01.418
PACK OF CIGARETTES A DAY IN

00:42:01.485 --> 00:42:03.454
TERMS OF HEALTH AND IMPACTS SO I

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:04.722
THINK WE'RE GONNA BE HEARING

00:42:04.788 --> 00:42:05.789
MORE ABOUT THAT.

00:42:05.856 --> 00:42:07.958
IN COMING YEARS IT'S KIND OF A

00:42:08.025 --> 00:42:09.927
CUTTING EDGE -- FACTOR RIGHT NOW

00:42:09.994 --> 00:42:10.828
THAT PEOPLE JUST STARTING TO

00:42:10.895 --> 00:42:12.696
LOOK AT ONE IN FIVE OR MEDI CAL

00:42:12.763 --> 00:42:14.899
ELIGIBLE SO WE REALLY HAVE THE

00:42:14.965 --> 00:42:16.433
NUMBERS AND I THINK THE

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:17.568
DOCUMENTATION OF THE NEED.

00:42:17.635 --> 00:42:19.236
THE CHALLENGES WHAT TO DO ABOUT

00:42:19.303 --> 00:42:21.338
IT AND WITH THE POPULATION

00:42:21.405 --> 00:42:24.675
HAVING GROWN BY 40% IN THE PAST

00:42:24.742 --> 00:42:26.677
DECADE THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDES

00:42:26.744 --> 00:42:27.778
SOME REALLY GOOD NUMBERS ABOUT

00:42:27.845 --> 00:42:28.312
THAT.

00:42:28.379 --> 00:42:34.685
I'M ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS.

00:42:34.752 --> 00:42:36.754
JUST MATCH REALLY THINKING YOU

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:38.155
WOULD EXPECT THE DOLLARS TO AT

00:42:38.222 --> 00:42:38.789
LEAST GROW IN A SIMILAR MANNER

00:42:38.856 --> 00:42:39.423
IF THE NEED IS STILL THERE AND

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:40.024
YOU'RE TRYING TO EFFECTIVELY

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:41.058
SERVE THOSE PEOPLE.

00:42:41.125 --> 00:42:44.795
BUT UNFORTUNATELY IN.

00:42:44.862 --> 00:42:45.362
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN THE

00:42:45.429 --> 00:42:46.931
STATE WHEN OUR COUNTRY WAS IN AN

00:42:46.997 --> 00:42:49.366
ECONOMIC CRISIS AGING PROGRAMS

00:42:49.433 --> 00:42:51.368
PARTICULARLY OLDER AMERICANS ACT

00:42:51.435 --> 00:42:53.003
RELATED PROGRAMS OLDER

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:55.072
CALIFORNIA'S ACT PROGRAMS.

00:42:55.139 --> 00:42:57.341
GOT CUT INTO HOLE BY ABOUT

00:42:57.408 --> 00:42:58.542
THIRTY THREE MILLION IN GENERAL

00:42:58.609 --> 00:43:01.712
FUNDS WE WENT FROM I THINK SIXTY

00:43:01.779 --> 00:43:02.479
FIVE BILLION I MIGHT BE OFF BY

00:43:02.546 --> 00:43:04.748
MILLION OR TWO ON HERE. TO THE

00:43:04.815 --> 00:43:06.684
SIX FROM SIXTY TWO MILLION TO

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:07.418
THIRTY THREE MILLION.

00:43:07.484 --> 00:43:10.054
SO THAT JUST DEVASTATED THE

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.823
TRIPLE A NETWORK AND OUR ABILITY

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:13.390
TO MEET.

00:43:13.457 --> 00:43:16.060
NEW SERVICES OR NEW DEMAND ON

00:43:16.126 --> 00:43:17.094
SERVICE MADE US EXTREMELY

00:43:17.161 --> 00:43:18.629
INNOVATIVE I MEAN I WOULD ARGUE

00:43:18.696 --> 00:43:20.831
WE ALWAYS HAD BEEN BUT WHEN THAT

00:43:20.898 --> 00:43:22.232
HAPPENED YOU SAW PROGRAM

00:43:22.299 --> 00:43:24.068
INTEGRATION BEYOND BELIEF BUT

00:43:24.134 --> 00:43:25.836
YOU ALSO SAW PROGRAM

00:43:25.903 --> 00:43:27.204
DETERIORATION.

00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:29.106
IN AN EXAMPLE OF THAT IS HOW DO

00:43:29.173 --> 00:43:31.842
WE KEEP MEETING MEAL NUMBERS

00:43:31.909 --> 00:43:33.010
MEAL DEMANDING AND I'LL TALK

00:43:33.077 --> 00:43:35.045
ABOUT THAT LATER IN A IN ANOTHER

00:43:35.112 --> 00:43:35.412
PANEL.

00:43:35.479 --> 00:43:39.950
BUT WHEN RESOURCES ARE SHRINKING

00:43:40.017 --> 00:43:41.385
LIKE THAT.

00:43:41.452 --> 00:43:42.586
DRASTIC STEPS ARE OFTEN TAKEN TO

00:43:42.653 --> 00:43:43.220
MAKE SURE SOME YOU'LL STILL GET

00:43:43.287 --> 00:43:44.188
OUT THERE SO THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:43:44.254 --> 00:43:45.923
PROGRAMS THAT INSTEAD OF

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:48.092
DELIVERING A DAILY MEAL DELIVER

00:43:48.158 --> 00:43:49.460
MEALS ONCE A WEEK.

00:43:49.526 --> 00:43:50.928
AND THAT TIES INTO ANOTHER THING

00:43:50.995 --> 00:43:52.396
JUST THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

00:43:52.463 --> 00:43:54.064
SUPPORTS THESE PROGRAMS THE

00:43:54.131 --> 00:43:55.899
PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO HELP

00:43:55.966 --> 00:43:57.401
REALLY USE VOLUNTEERS.

00:43:57.468 --> 00:43:59.236
AND THEY'RE NOT JUST VOLUNTEERS

00:43:59.303 --> 00:44:02.239
THAT LICK ENVELOPES OMBUDSMAN IS

00:44:02.306 --> 00:44:03.874
A GREAT EXAMPLE OF VOLUNTEERS IN

00:44:03.941 --> 00:44:05.275
THE THE HIGH LEVEL OF SKILL.

00:44:05.342 --> 00:44:06.710
THE HIGH CAP PROGRAM HEALTH

00:44:06.777 --> 00:44:08.145
INSURANCE COUNTS AND ASSISTANCE

00:44:08.212 --> 00:44:10.180
PROGRAM THAT RELIES ON

00:44:10.247 --> 00:44:12.716
VOLUNTEERS TO EXPLAIN MEDICARE

00:44:12.783 --> 00:44:13.751
FOR PEOPLE AND THAT'S A VERY

00:44:13.817 --> 00:44:16.053
COMPLICATED SYSTEM FOR SOMEBODY

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:18.389
OFF THE STREET WHO'S NOT

00:44:18.455 --> 00:44:19.623
COMPENSATED TO TRY TO DO.

00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:21.125
TAX ACCOUNTING PROGRAMS FOR

00:44:21.191 --> 00:44:22.893
SENIORS AGAIN THESE ARE

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.195
VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS NOW IMAGINE

00:44:25.262 --> 00:44:25.963
IF.

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:27.698
H. AND R. BLOCK OR REQUIRED TO

00:44:27.765 --> 00:44:31.568
USE VOLUNTEERS TO DO THEIR TAXES

00:44:31.635 --> 00:44:33.170
OR IF.

00:44:33.237 --> 00:44:33.804
SCHOOLS WERE REQUIRED TO USE

00:44:33.871 --> 00:44:36.306
VOLUNTEERS TO TEACH CLASSES OR

00:44:36.373 --> 00:44:37.941
YOU KNOW IF BANKERS HAVE THEY

00:44:38.008 --> 00:44:40.611
HAVE 75% OF THEIR STAFF BE

00:44:40.677 --> 00:44:43.313
VOLUNTEERS WE WE WOULD JUST.

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:45.282
NEVER CONSIDER THAT REALISTIC OR

00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:48.552
ACCEPTABLE BUT THAT'S THE WAY

00:44:48.619 --> 00:44:49.920
THE AGING COMMUNITY AN AGING

00:44:49.987 --> 00:44:51.955
PROGRAMS ARE SET UP BUT YOU HAVE

00:44:52.022 --> 00:44:53.757
TO USE PRIMARILY VOLUNTEERS FOR

00:44:53.824 --> 00:44:55.225
A LOT OF THESE PROGRAMS.

00:44:55.292 --> 00:44:56.160
SO.

00:44:56.226 --> 00:44:58.562
THAT'S A CONCERN THAT THAT I

00:44:58.629 --> 00:44:59.963
THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT I KNOW

00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:01.532
I'M GOING ON FOR A WHILE SO I'LL

00:45:01.598 --> 00:45:05.002
TRY TO WRAP UP HERE -- I THINK

00:45:05.069 --> 00:45:06.603
THERE'S THERE'S TWO KEY FACTORS

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:08.439
GOING FORWARD THAT WE SHOULD ALL

00:45:08.505 --> 00:45:09.106
THINK ABOUT.

00:45:09.173 --> 00:45:11.942
AND ONE IS YOU KNOW DO WE DO

00:45:12.009 --> 00:45:14.111
SOMETHING PROGRESSIVE OR

00:45:14.178 --> 00:45:14.745
CREATIVE AROUND THIS FOR WEEKS

00:45:14.812 --> 00:45:17.381
DO WE JUST TRY TO AVOID IT.

00:45:17.448 --> 00:45:19.516
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS AND WE CAN

00:45:19.583 --> 00:45:21.518
DO EITHER SO FAR MOST OF THE

00:45:21.585 --> 00:45:25.556
ACTION HAS BEEN TO HOPE FOR THE

00:45:25.622 --> 00:45:26.723
BEST WITH NO.

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:27.958
AGGRESSIVE OR PROGRESSIVE ACTION

00:45:28.025 --> 00:45:29.059
BEING TAKEN TO DEAL WITH THIS

00:45:29.126 --> 00:45:31.261
HUGE INCREASE IN THE POPULATION.

00:45:31.328 --> 00:45:33.630
SO IF WE DO THAT WHAT HAPPENS WE

00:45:33.697 --> 00:45:34.765
HAVE MORE PEOPLE

00:45:34.832 --> 00:45:36.600
INSTITUTIONALIZED WHICH IS

00:45:36.667 --> 00:45:37.568
PROBABLY THE HIGHEST

00:45:37.634 --> 00:45:39.837
INTERVENTION POSSIBLE FOR THE

00:45:39.903 --> 00:45:41.405
ONLY ONE THAT'S HIGHER IS MORE

00:45:41.472 --> 00:45:42.573
PEOPLE BEING INJURED OR HAVING

00:45:42.639 --> 00:45:44.475
STROKES ARE CATASTROPHIC

00:45:44.541 --> 00:45:44.775
ILLNESSES.

00:45:44.842 --> 00:45:47.077
THAT DAN AND UP IN HOSPITALS SO

00:45:47.144 --> 00:45:48.946
THAT'S THE DO NOTHING ROUTINE

00:45:49.012 --> 00:45:50.747
WHICH I THINK YOU KNOW WE COULD

00:45:50.814 --> 00:45:52.015
DO THAT BUT WE'RE GOING TO PAY

00:45:52.082 --> 00:45:53.517
THROUGH THE NOSE FOR TO HAPPEN

00:45:53.584 --> 00:45:55.819
IN THE QUALITY OF LIFE OBVIOUSLY

00:45:55.886 --> 00:45:58.055
GOES DOWN. FOR WE CAN LOOK AT

00:45:58.122 --> 00:46:00.190
CREATIVE SOLUTIONS THAT TRY TO

00:46:00.257 --> 00:46:02.226
AVERT OUR PREVENT OR DELAY THOSE

00:46:02.292 --> 00:46:03.460
THINGS FROM HAPPENING.

00:46:03.527 --> 00:46:05.395
AND IF WE INVEST A LITTLE MONEY

00:46:05.462 --> 00:46:07.898
IN THAT WE CAN LOWER THE OVERALL

00:46:07.965 --> 00:46:10.467
COSTS AND INCREASE THE QUALITY

00:46:10.534 --> 00:46:11.935
OF LIFE THAT EVERYBODY RECEIVES

00:46:12.002 --> 00:46:15.072
IT'S A CHOICE THAT WE ALL HALF.

00:46:15.139 --> 00:46:16.540
YOU KNOW IF WE DON'T DO ANYTHING

00:46:16.607 --> 00:46:18.842
WHERE BASICALLY CHOOSING LET'S

00:46:18.909 --> 00:46:20.010
HAVE THE HIGHEST INTERVENTIONS

00:46:20.077 --> 00:46:21.245
OUT THERE POSSIBLE.

00:46:21.311 --> 00:46:22.980
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WE DON'T

00:46:23.046 --> 00:46:24.381
HAVE TO CREATE BRAND NEW

00:46:24.448 --> 00:46:27.251
PROGRAMS THE PROGRAMS THAT ED

00:46:27.317 --> 00:46:29.052

00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:30.787

00:46:30.854 --> 00:46:31.822
EFFECTIVELY.

00:46:31.889 --> 00:46:33.390
AND ALL WE NEED TO DO IS MAKE

00:46:33.457 --> 00:46:34.291
SURE THERE'S ADEQUATE

00:46:34.358 --> 00:46:36.393
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THOSE TO WORK

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:38.061
SO IT'S NOT ARE YOU KNOW

00:46:38.128 --> 00:46:39.730
ANYTHING NEW INNOVATIVE IS IS

00:46:39.796 --> 00:46:41.198
OBVIOUSLY WELCOME AND GREAT.

00:46:41.265 --> 00:46:43.200
BUT THE BASS LINE IN COURT IS

00:46:43.267 --> 00:46:45.169
ALREADY THERE SO WE CAN HAVE

00:46:45.235 --> 00:46:47.004
SUCCESS BOTH FINANCIALLY IN

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:48.172

01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:29.819
AS AN ASSOCIATION WE DO NOT

01:01:29.886 --> 01:01:31.888
BELIEVE THAT THE ONE FULL TIME

01:01:31.954 --> 01:01:34.090
EMPLOYEE TO TWO THOUSAND BEDS IS

01:01:34.157 --> 01:01:35.591

I APPRECIATE THAT OKAY SO SO

01:01:43.199 --> 01:01:44.667

01:01:52.175 --> 01:01:54.043
NINETEEN NINETY THREE DATA.

01:01:54.110 --> 01:01:56.212
SO IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO USE THE

01:01:56.279 --> 01:01:58.681
WORK THAT WE WERE DOING IN

01:01:58.748 --> 01:01:59.248
NINETEEN NINETY FIVE AS THE

01:01:59.315 --> 01:02:00.450
MEASURE FOR FUNDING THE PROGRAM

01:02:00.516 --> 01:02:02.351
IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN I'D

01:02:02.418 --> 01:02:03.920
LIKE TO POINT OUT A FEW THINGS

01:02:03.986 --> 01:02:04.353
THAT HAVE CHANGED.

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:06.589
I'M NOT GOING TO EVEN GO INTO

01:02:06.656 --> 01:02:10.426
TECHNOLOGY OR BUDGETS BUT JUST.

01:02:10.493 --> 01:02:13.429
WHO HAD THAT RIGHT -- BUT IN.

01:02:13.496 --> 01:02:14.030
NINETEEN NINETY THREE THE TOP

01:02:14.097 --> 01:02:15.832
COMPLAINT THAT LOCAL OMBUDSMAN

01:02:15.898 --> 01:02:18.968
PROGRAMS INVESTIGATED A 21% FOR

01:02:19.035 --> 01:02:22.071
QUALITY OF CARE. 18% WERE

01:02:22.138 --> 01:02:24.674
RESIDENT RIGHTS LESS THAN 10% OF

01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:26.142
ALL THE COMPLAINTS INVESTIGATED

01:02:26.209 --> 01:02:28.010
THAT YEAR HAD ANYTHING TO DO

01:02:28.077 --> 01:02:29.979
WITH ABUSE.

01:02:30.046 --> 01:02:31.647
AND YET IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

01:02:31.714 --> 01:02:33.015
FORTY HEARD IT REPORTED.

01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:34.917
NEARLY ONE IN EVERY FOUR

01:02:34.984 --> 01:02:36.519
COMPLAINTS INVESTIGATED FELL

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:38.054
UNDER THE CATEGORY OF ELDER

01:02:38.121 --> 01:02:40.456
ABUSE.

01:02:40.523 --> 01:02:42.625
OUR TOP GO GETTER THIS YEAR

01:02:42.692 --> 01:02:45.628
RESIDENT ON RESIDENT CONFLICT.

01:02:45.695 --> 01:02:47.196
FOLLOWED SHORTLY BY PHYSICAL

01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:48.431
NEGLECT.

01:02:48.498 --> 01:02:49.899
SO IF YOU WANT TO USE YOUR RATIO

01:02:49.966 --> 01:02:51.501
OF ONE TO TWO THOUSAND I THINK

01:02:51.567 --> 01:02:53.302
YOU HAVE TO USE THE COMPARISON

01:02:53.369 --> 01:02:54.303
THE WORKLOAD AND IT IS CHANGED

01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:54.604
[inaudible]

01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:56.806
SECOND.

01:02:56.873 --> 01:02:59.509
THIS PROGRAM THIS THIS REPORT

01:02:59.575 --> 01:03:01.644
IDENTIFIES MINIMUM EFFECTIVE

01:03:01.711 --> 01:03:03.546
PROGRAM.

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:05.114
WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD WE WANT

01:03:05.181 --> 01:03:07.216
TO USE THAT AS OUR STANDARD? TO

01:03:07.283 --> 01:03:08.718
START OUT OUR DISCUSSION WITH

01:03:08.784 --> 01:03:09.685
THIS BEING THE MINIMUM

01:03:09.752 --> 01:03:10.853
EFFECTIVENESS.

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:15.858
THIS IS CALIFORNIA.

01:03:15.925 --> 01:03:17.627
THE OTHER PART OF THAT.

01:03:17.693 --> 01:03:19.629
IS THAT WHEN THIS REPORT WAS

01:03:19.695 --> 01:03:22.098
WRITTEN IT'S A FEDERAL REPORT.

01:03:22.165 --> 01:03:23.232
AN OMBUDSMAN PROGRAMS ARE RUN

01:03:23.299 --> 01:03:25.067
VERY DIFFERENTLY ACROSS THIS

01:03:25.134 --> 01:03:25.768
COUNTRY.

01:03:25.835 --> 01:03:26.969
THEY'RE ON BUT IT'S BEEN

01:03:27.036 --> 01:03:29.572
PROGRAMS THAT HAVE -- ONE

01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:31.541
CENTRAL OFFICE THAT DOES ALL OF

01:03:31.607 --> 01:03:34.477
THE PHONE INTAKE OR ALL OF THE

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:36.746
THE THE AT ADMINISTRATIVE WORK

01:03:36.812 --> 01:03:37.847
OR THERE ARE STATES WHERE THEY

01:03:37.914 --> 01:03:40.716
HAVE A FEW LOCAL PROGRAMS.

01:03:40.783 --> 01:03:41.984
BUT CALIFORNIA AS YOU HEARD

01:03:42.051 --> 01:03:44.487
EARLIER WE BELIEVE IN THE TRIPLE

01:03:44.554 --> 01:03:47.123
A PROCESS WE BELIEVE IN LOCAL

01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:48.658
CONTROL AND SO THE OMBUDSMAN

01:03:48.724 --> 01:03:50.026
PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA.

01:03:50.092 --> 01:03:51.694
IS EITHER A CONTRACTED PROGRAM

01:03:51.761 --> 01:03:53.429
OR A DOES WRECKED SERVICE

01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:55.398
PROGRAM THROUGH THE THIRTY THREE

01:03:55.464 --> 01:03:56.799
AREA AGENCIES ON AGING.

01:03:56.866 --> 01:03:58.034
SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE THAT

01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:00.469
STANDARD OF THE ONE TO TWO

01:04:00.536 --> 01:04:01.270
THOUSAND THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE

01:04:01.337 --> 01:04:03.439

THAT WE HAVE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

01:04:05.575 --> 01:04:08.110

01:29:56.057 --> 01:29:57.225
THAT'S ALSO UNDER THE PARM

01:29:57.291 --> 01:29:58.493
HEALTHCARE SERVICES WOULD HAVE

01:29:58.559 --> 01:29:59.560

I DO WANT TO COMMITMENT.

01:30:10.138 --> 01:30:11.906
IT IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT ISSUE

01:30:11.973 --> 01:30:13.207
AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO

01:30:13.274 --> 01:30:15.409
INSTEAD OF SAY WE WILL TRY.

01:30:15.476 --> 01:30:18.012
WE HAVE TO DO IT WE HAVE TO LOOK

01:30:18.079 --> 01:30:19.147
TO SEE.

01:30:19.213 --> 01:30:20.782
BECAUSE LOTS OF WORK HAS GONE

01:30:20.848 --> 01:30:22.884
INTO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE

01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:24.185
MAKE THE SUSTAINABLE.

01:30:24.252 --> 01:30:27.321
AND IF IF THERE HAVE BEEN.

01:30:27.388 --> 01:30:28.756
IF THERE'S ALREADY BEEN WORK

01:30:28.823 --> 01:30:30.758
DONE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHERE

01:30:30.825 --> 01:30:32.326
WE CAN GET THE MONEY TO MAKE IT

01:30:32.393 --> 01:30:34.128
SUSTAINABLE WE REALLY OWE IT TO

01:30:34.195 --> 01:30:36.964
THE ADVOCATES. TO FIND OUT.

01:30:37.031 --> 01:30:40.401
IF THIS IS DOABLE AND IF IT IS

01:30:40.468 --> 01:30:42.203
FIGURE OUT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.

01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:43.805
BUT IT TAKES US BACK TO THE THE

01:30:43.871 --> 01:30:45.373
TO THE MASTER PLAN.

01:30:45.439 --> 01:30:47.508
OUR OUR GOVERNOR IN THE STATE OF

01:30:47.575 --> 01:30:49.677
THE STATE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

01:30:49.744 --> 01:30:52.280
SO WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT BEFORE

01:30:52.346 --> 01:30:54.515
IT OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE HERE

01:30:54.582 --> 01:30:56.517
HAVE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THIS

01:30:56.584 --> 01:30:57.618
BEFORE WE NEED A MASTER PLAN.

01:30:57.685 --> 01:30:59.954
OUR DOCTOR WOULD JUST TALKED

01:31:00.021 --> 01:31:00.555
ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE NEED A

01:31:00.621 --> 01:31:01.289
MASTER PLAN.

01:31:01.355 --> 01:31:03.124
OUR GOVERNOR HAS NOW TALKED

01:31:03.191 --> 01:31:03.724
ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE NEED A

01:31:03.791 --> 01:31:05.226
MASTER PLAN.

01:31:05.293 --> 01:31:06.627
WE'RE GOING TO GET A MASTER PLAN.

01:31:06.694 --> 01:31:08.229
AND I THINK IT IS EXTREMELY

01:31:08.296 --> 01:31:09.831
IMPORTANT THAT WE ALL MOVE IN

01:31:09.897 --> 01:31:13.034
THAT DIRECTION -- IN THE IN THE

01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:15.903
LAST -- SUB ONE A HEARING THAT

01:31:15.970 --> 01:31:17.939
WE HAD THERE WAS A REQUEST FOR

01:31:18.005 --> 01:31:20.274
MILLION DOLLARS FOR STUDY.

01:31:20.341 --> 01:31:21.776
SO WE'RE GOING TO STUDY WITH THE

01:31:21.843 --> 01:31:24.111
NEEDS OF OUR SENIORS ARE.

01:31:24.178 --> 01:31:25.313
AND THEN WHAT.

01:31:25.379 --> 01:31:26.614
WE DON'T HAVE A PLAN WITH WHAT

01:31:26.681 --> 01:31:29.083
WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH THAT.

01:31:29.150 --> 01:31:31.552
WITH THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY

01:31:31.619 --> 01:31:33.487
THEN IT BECOMES MEANINGLESS AND

01:31:33.554 --> 01:31:34.589
THAT'S A MILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE

01:31:34.655 --> 01:31:36.757
SPENT ON THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM

01:31:36.824 --> 01:31:38.125
INSTEAD OF SPENDING ON STUDY.

01:31:38.192 --> 01:31:39.894
WE HAVE AN IDEA ALREADY WHAT THE

01:31:39.961 --> 01:31:41.729
PROBLEM IS WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE

01:31:41.796 --> 01:31:43.164
OUT A WAY.

01:31:43.231 --> 01:31:45.132
AND IT ISN'T TO SAY THAT

01:31:45.199 --> 01:31:46.200
SOMEONE'S OF FOLDER SOMEONE'S

01:31:46.267 --> 01:31:48.236
NOT AT FAULT WE'RE ALL IN THIS

01:31:48.302 --> 01:31:50.071
TOGETHER.

01:31:50.137 --> 01:31:51.405
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER I

01:31:51.472 --> 01:31:53.908
SHARED THE STORY LAST TIME THAT

01:31:53.975 --> 01:31:55.509
I I ONCE A WEEK.

01:31:55.576 --> 01:31:57.879
OR WHAT ONE WEEK PER YEAR I

01:31:57.945 --> 01:32:00.181

01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:07.881
SOMETHING WE NEED TO DO WITH THE

01:43:07.948 --> 01:43:09.950
FEDERAL SIDE TO GET THAT FORMULA

01:43:10.017 --> 01:43:12.920
CHANGED -- I HAVE NO PROBLEM BY.

MAYBE MISTER WAS OR ALL OF US.

01:43:18.125 --> 01:43:22.262
ON TO ASK THAT COULD CHANGE.

01:43:22.329 --> 01:43:23.864
TO I CAN THINK OF CALIFORNIA

01:43:23.931 --> 01:43:25.432
OKAY LIKE I CAN ALSO SPEAK TO

01:43:25.499 --> 01:43:26.266
THAT THE THE THE ALLEN THE FUNNY

01:43:26.333 --> 01:43:27.834
ALLOCATION IS IN.

01:43:27.901 --> 01:43:29.536
THE WELL FOR INSTITUTIONS CODE

01:43:29.603 --> 01:43:30.837
IN CALIFORNIA LAW BUT THE

01:43:30.904 --> 01:43:32.472
ADMINISTRATION ON AGING IS

01:43:32.539 --> 01:43:35.242
CONDUCTING A NEW EVALUATION OF

01:43:35.309 --> 01:43:36.643
LONG TERM CARE BUTTON PROGRAM.

01:43:36.710 --> 01:43:40.581
THAT WILL UPDATE THAT RATIO SO.

01:43:40.647 --> 01:43:42.916
THAT IS IMMINENT.

01:43:42.983 --> 01:43:44.351
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT

01:43:44.418 --> 01:43:46.053
THAT THAT IS AGAIN A FEDERAL

01:43:46.119 --> 01:43:46.987
STANDARD.

01:43:47.054 --> 01:43:48.689
THAT IS NOT BASED ON THE

01:43:48.755 --> 01:43:50.057
CALIFORNIA MANDATES WHICH WE

01:43:50.123 --> 01:43:51.358
DON'T WANT TO GET RID OF BECAUSE

01:43:51.425 --> 01:43:52.893
WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT

01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:53.927
THAT.

01:43:53.994 --> 01:43:56.697
RESIDENTS HAVE WITNESSING --

01:43:56.763 --> 01:43:57.931
ACTIONS FOR ADVANCE HEALTH CARE

01:43:57.998 --> 01:44:00.367
DIRECTIVE AND WE WE BELIEVE THAT

01:44:00.434 --> 01:44:01.668
THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF THE

01:44:01.735 --> 01:44:03.370
OMBUDSMAN BEING THAT AND

01:44:03.437 --> 01:44:05.405
MICHELLE RECEIVER OF ELDER ABUSE

01:44:05.472 --> 01:44:06.807
ALLEGATIONS THAT THAT SHOULD

01:44:06.873 --> 01:44:08.875
CONTINUE THERE'S ONLY FOUR OTHER

01:44:08.942 --> 01:44:10.210
STATES IN THE NATION THAT HAVE

01:44:10.277 --> 01:44:12.245
THAT SO THIS FEDERAL STANDARD

01:44:12.312 --> 01:44:12.646
ONE INCLUDE SOME.

01:44:12.713 --> 01:44:15.983
SOME SIGNIFICANT WORKLOAD FOR US

01:44:16.049 --> 01:44:17.584
IN A MANTHAT'S WHY MISSION.

01:44:17.651 --> 01:44:19.653
AS THE MEMBERS HERE ALL

01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:22.723
SUPPORTIVE THAT WE CAN DO AN AJ

01:44:22.789 --> 01:44:24.024
ARE ASKING THE FEDERAL.

01:44:24.091 --> 01:44:24.858
GOVERNMENT.

01:44:24.925 --> 01:44:28.895
TO POSSIBLY CHANGE THEIR FORMULA

01:44:28.962 --> 01:44:29.196
[inaudible]

01:44:29.262 --> 01:44:32.566
FOR BUT CALIFORNIA.

01:44:32.633 --> 01:44:35.469
GOOD LUCK TO US ON THAT QUESTION.

01:44:35.535 --> 01:44:36.103
BOB YET MAYBE WILL PUT IT IN ON

01:44:36.169 --> 01:44:37.304
MY NAME.

01:44:37.371 --> 01:44:39.306
WE JUST MIGHT HAVE.

01:44:39.373 --> 01:44:41.908
TO SO AT MY LAST QUESTION.

01:44:41.975 --> 01:44:43.677
IF THE IF THE INVESTMENT IS MADE

01:44:43.744 --> 01:44:45.979
TO AUGMENT THE LONG TERM CARE

01:44:46.046 --> 01:44:48.015
OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM TO FUND THE

01:44:48.081 --> 01:44:49.650
ABILITY FOR THE PROGRAM TO VISIT

01:44:49.716 --> 01:44:51.618
ALL FACILITIES.

01:44:51.685 --> 01:44:53.887
ON AT LEAST A QUARTERLY.

01:44:53.954 --> 01:44:55.355
QUARTERLY BASIS.

01:44:55.422 --> 01:44:57.758
THEN I THINK THE SUGGESTION IS

01:44:57.824 --> 01:44:58.792
THAT WE HAVE TRAILER BILL

01:44:58.859 --> 01:45:03.196
LANGUAGE -- TO CODIFY.

01:45:03.263 --> 01:45:04.665
THIS PRACTICE.

01:45:04.731 --> 01:45:05.198
I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:45:05.265 --> 01:45:06.867
TALKING ABOUT.

01:45:06.933 --> 01:45:08.969
WE HAVE A REACTION FROM THE

01:45:09.036 --> 01:45:14.841
ADMINISTRATION.

01:45:14.908 --> 01:45:17.377
MY MY ONLY CONCERN WITH WITH

01:45:17.444 --> 01:45:20.347
CODIFYING THAT.

01:45:20.414 --> 01:45:22.849
IS THAT -- SHOULD THE

01:45:22.916 --> 01:45:24.017
LEGISLATURE IN THE MINISTRY

01:45:24.084 --> 01:45:26.119
ADMINISTRATION DECIDE TO AUGMENT

01:45:26.186 --> 01:45:29.923
THIS PROGRAM WITH THIS REQUEST.

01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:33.493
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THINGS GET BAD

01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:35.462
AGAIN AND WE LOSE MONEY?

01:45:35.529 --> 01:45:37.831
IF WE HAVE THIS ON THE BOOKS

01:45:37.898 --> 01:45:38.131
[inaudible]

01:45:38.198 --> 01:45:41.234
WE'RE WE'RE WE'VE GOT A MANDATE

01:45:41.301 --> 01:45:42.969
THAT WE CAN'T MEET.

01:45:43.036 --> 01:45:49.309
THAT'S THAT'S MY ONLY CONCERN.

01:45:49.376 --> 01:45:52.312
IT'S IT'S NOT IT'S IT'S AN

01:45:52.379 --> 01:45:53.814
IMPORTANT STANDARD THAT THE

01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:55.916
ADMINISTRATION ON AGING WANTS US

01:45:55.982 --> 01:45:57.384
TO STRIVE [inaudible]

01:45:57.451 --> 01:45:59.886
FOR BUT THEY KNOW THAT THEIR

01:45:59.953 --> 01:46:01.221
FUNDING.

01:46:01.288 --> 01:46:02.289
AND THE FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVE

01:46:02.355 --> 01:46:04.658
FROM CONGRESS.

01:46:04.725 --> 01:46:07.160
ISN'T ALWAYS GOING TO BE ABLE TO

01:46:07.227 --> 01:46:09.296
SUPPORT THAT IN EVERY STATE.

01:46:09.362 --> 01:46:10.430
I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM

01:46:10.497 --> 01:46:12.499
THOUGH IS THAT IF WE DON'T SET A

01:46:12.566 --> 01:46:16.303
STANDARD AND THAT'S WHY I THE

01:46:16.369 --> 01:46:19.306
FIRST PART OF MY SENTENCE WAS.

01:46:19.372 --> 01:46:20.707
IF AN INVESTMENT IS MADE TO

01:46:20.774 --> 01:46:24.010
AUGMENT IT.

01:46:24.077 --> 01:46:26.179
DO THEN CODIFY IT BECAUSE IF.

01:46:26.246 --> 01:46:29.382
WE AUGMENTED THE IF WE INCREASE

01:46:29.449 --> 01:46:30.984
THE FUNDING.

01:46:31.051 --> 01:46:34.988
AND WE DON'T CODIFY IT THEN I I

01:46:35.055 --> 01:46:35.589
I'M NOT SAYING THIS IS WHAT

01:46:35.655 --> 01:46:36.690
WOULD HAPPEN.

01:46:36.757 --> 01:46:37.891
BUT CLEARLY.

01:46:37.958 --> 01:46:39.126
THERE COULD BE THAT MONEY COULD

01:46:39.192 --> 01:46:40.660
BE USED FOR SOMETHING ELSE.

01:46:40.727 --> 01:46:42.429
WHERE IS IF WE CODIFY IT THEN WE

01:46:42.496 --> 01:46:44.531
ARE SAYING THIS IS WHAT NEEDS TO

01:46:44.598 --> 01:46:46.066
HAPPEN THERE NEED TO BE

01:46:46.133 --> 01:46:49.136
QUARTERLY -- VISITS.

01:46:49.202 --> 01:46:50.504
ARE UNANNOUNCED VISITS AS HAVE

01:46:50.570 --> 01:46:52.372
BEEN HAVE BEEN TESTIFIED TO

01:46:52.439 --> 01:46:53.073
THERE HAVE TO BE QUARTERLY

01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:55.142
VISITS WITH THEM ARE ABLE TO

01:46:55.208 --> 01:46:57.644
PROTECT OUR SENIORS IN A BETTER

01:46:57.711 --> 01:47:00.514
WAY THAN WE'RE ABLE TO NOW -- IF

01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:02.983
THE CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD CHANGE

01:47:03.049 --> 01:47:05.152
THEN CERTAINLY THE LEGISLATURE

01:47:05.218 --> 01:47:07.053
HAS THE ABSOLUTE POWER TO CHANGE

01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:09.189
THE LANGUAGE ALSO OF WHAT IS

01:47:09.256 --> 01:47:10.824
REQUIRED OF YOU.

01:47:10.891 --> 01:47:12.659
IF IT'S AN UNFUNDED MANDATE

01:47:12.726 --> 01:47:13.927
WE'RE TELLING YOU YOU'VE GOT TO

01:47:13.994 --> 01:47:15.328
GO OVER A QUARTER AND YET WE

01:47:15.395 --> 01:47:18.965
GIVE YOU ENOUGH TO JUST GO ONCE

01:47:19.032 --> 01:47:21.334
A YEAR -- THE LEGISLATURE JUST

01:47:21.401 --> 01:47:22.269
AS WE WOULD WANT TO WORK WITH

01:47:22.335 --> 01:47:24.704
YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE WOULD

01:47:24.771 --> 01:47:25.172
WORK WITH YOU THEM.

01:47:25.238 --> 01:47:27.374
WE CAN'T EXPECT YOU TO DO

01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:28.975
SOMETHING YOU CANNOT.

01:47:29.042 --> 01:47:32.712
YOU DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING.

01:47:32.779 --> 01:47:33.346
FOR PLEASE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY

01:47:33.413 --> 01:47:35.248
SOMETHING -- I HAVE DONE A QUICK

01:47:35.315 --> 01:47:36.750
POLL OF OUR MEMBERS.

01:47:36.817 --> 01:47:38.185
AND THAT BY AND LARGE THE

01:47:38.251 --> 01:47:40.253
MEMBERS ARE SUPPORTIVE OF BEING

01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:41.788
GIVEN SOME GUIDELINES.

01:47:41.855 --> 01:47:44.524
THAT CONCERNS ARE THAT IT NOT

01:47:44.591 --> 01:47:47.861
HAPPEN ON JULY FIRST THAT YOU.

01:47:47.928 --> 01:47:49.162
GIVE US FIVE POINT TWO MILLION

01:47:49.229 --> 01:47:51.865
AND EXPECT BY THE END OF TWO

01:47:51.932 --> 01:47:52.732
THOUSAND NINETEEN THAT WE WOULD

01:47:52.799 --> 01:47:54.167
BE ABLE TO MEET THAT.

01:47:54.234 --> 01:47:56.236
ARE HIGHER BARK IT WILL TAKE US

01:47:56.303 --> 01:47:58.905
A NUMBER OF YEARS TO GET FROM

01:47:58.972 --> 01:47:59.806
SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX

01:47:59.873 --> 01:48:01.908
VOLUNTEERS BACK UP. TO THE

01:48:01.975 --> 01:48:03.510
THOUSAND OR MORE THAT WE NEED AS

01:48:03.577 --> 01:48:05.312
WELL AS TRAINING STAFF THIS IS

01:48:05.378 --> 01:48:07.080
NOT A JOB THAT YOU CAN WALK IN

01:48:07.147 --> 01:48:10.217
ON MONDAY AND DO IT ON FRIDAY.

01:48:10.283 --> 01:48:12.719
SO IF YOU GIVE US A FEW YEARS OF

01:48:12.786 --> 01:48:15.121
TIME TO GO FROM OUR 60%

01:48:15.188 --> 01:48:16.590
COMPLIANCE OP.

01:48:16.656 --> 01:48:18.191
THE OTHER PART TO CONSIDER IS

01:48:18.258 --> 01:48:19.826
THERE WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A

01:48:19.893 --> 01:48:22.295
PERCENTAGE OF BLOCKS JUST A

01:48:22.362 --> 01:48:25.732
SIMPLE EXAMPLE IF S. A FACILITY

01:48:25.799 --> 01:48:30.670
IS NAMED ABC IN THE VERY FIRST

01:48:30.737 --> 01:48:31.137
QUARTER OF THE YEAR.

01:48:31.204 --> 01:48:33.173
AND THEN SOMETHING HAPPENS AND

01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:34.741
THE CHANGE ON OUR SHIP AND ON

01:48:34.808 --> 01:48:36.843
THE SECOND QUARTER OF THE YEAR.

01:48:36.910 --> 01:48:40.247
THEY TURN INTO X. Y. Z. FACILITY.

01:48:40.313 --> 01:48:41.715
THE OMBUDSMAN'S CURRENT

01:48:41.781 --> 01:48:43.850
REPORTING STATUS WOULD SAY YOU

01:48:43.917 --> 01:48:46.553
VISITED ABC IN THE FIRST QUARTER

01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:48.588
BUT YOU DID NOT VISIT THEM IN

01:48:48.655 --> 01:48:49.289
THE SECOND THIRD AND FOURTH

01:48:49.356 --> 01:48:50.156
QUARTER.

01:48:50.223 --> 01:48:51.691
THEY DIDN'T EXIST.

01:48:51.758 --> 01:48:53.894
SO YOU WE GOT DETAINED FOR THAT

01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:55.729
ONE ABC FACILITY AND THEN

01:48:55.795 --> 01:48:57.163
BECAUSE YOU NOW HAVE THE X. Y.

01:48:57.230 --> 01:48:58.732
Z. FACILITY THAT IS OPEN AND YOU

01:48:58.798 --> 01:49:00.500
VISITED THEM SECOND THIRD AND

01:49:00.567 --> 01:49:02.269
FOURTH QUARTER YOU WOULD STILL

01:49:02.335 --> 01:49:03.670
BE DOING.

01:49:03.737 --> 01:49:05.672
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T GET TO THAT

01:49:05.739 --> 01:49:07.440
FACILITY ALL FOUR QUARTERS WAR

01:49:07.507 --> 01:49:09.876
YOU HAVE EXAMPLES OF FACILITIES

01:49:09.943 --> 01:49:11.044
THAT WERE IN FIRES THOSE

01:49:11.111 --> 01:49:12.913
FACILITIES BURNED DOWN THERE

01:49:12.979 --> 01:49:14.381
WOULD BE NO POINT IN GOING TO

01:49:14.447 --> 01:49:15.649
VISIT A FACILITY.

01:49:15.715 --> 01:49:17.284
THAT HAS BEEN OPENED SO I WOULD

01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:19.686
SAY IF YOU DON'T EXPECT A 100%

01:49:19.753 --> 01:49:23.757
IF YOU SAID MAYBE 8085% WELL

01:49:23.823 --> 01:49:26.559
RATHER THAN SAY PERCENTAGE.

01:49:26.626 --> 01:49:31.064
I I THINK THAT IF YOU WERE TO IF.

01:49:31.131 --> 01:49:32.565
THE OMBUDSMAN APPROACH.

01:49:32.632 --> 01:49:33.433
PEOPLE WERE TO COME TO US AND

01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:34.801
SAY.

01:49:34.868 --> 01:49:37.637
THIS FACILITY BURNED DOWN SO WE

01:49:37.704 --> 01:49:40.073
CAN'T IN -- VISIT.

01:49:40.140 --> 01:49:41.441
RIGHT THE LANGUAGE WOULD

01:49:41.508 --> 01:49:43.076
CERTAINLY BE PUT IN I WOULD THAT

01:49:43.143 --> 01:49:44.344
HAPPEN WE HAVE TO WORK ON THE

01:49:44.411 --> 01:49:45.712
LANGUAGE YES WE KNOW WHAT THE

01:49:45.779 --> 01:49:47.747
CONCEPT IS WE KNOW WHAT IT IS WE

01:49:47.814 --> 01:49:49.049
WANT TO ACCOMPLISH.

01:49:49.115 --> 01:49:50.784
SO IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE MONEY

01:49:50.850 --> 01:49:52.018
IN IS GOING TO REQUIRE THE

01:49:52.085 --> 01:49:55.155
LANGUAGE TO CODIFY IT IS TO WHAT

01:49:55.221 --> 01:49:57.157
WE'RE GOING TO BE SPENDING THE

01:49:57.223 --> 01:49:59.492
MONEY ON YEAH.

WE ARE IS ALL WE WERE ABLE WE

01:50:00.393 --> 01:50:01.795
JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHERE

01:50:01.861 --> 01:50:03.997
WE'RE GOING TO GET THE MONEY.

01:50:04.064 --> 01:50:05.932
AND THEN HOW WE'RE GOING -- TO

01:50:05.999 --> 01:50:10.704

01:50:10.770 --> 01:50:13.206
THAT WE WANT. FOR WHICH WE WANT

01:50:13.273 --> 01:50:15.508
THAT MONEY TO BE SPENT.

01:50:15.575 --> 01:50:17.043
BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE EVERYBODY

01:50:17.110 --> 01:50:18.311
WORKING TOGETHER ON THAT AND

01:50:18.378 --> 01:50:19.980

REALLY BEING A DISINVESTMENT

02:01:45.998 --> 02:01:47.667
THAT THE GENERAL FUNDING IN THE

DEPARTMENT OF AGING TODAY IS.

02:01:51.504 --> 02:01:52.905

02:01:52.972 --> 02:01:54.974
IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT IF YOU

02:01:55.041 --> 02:01:56.542

CONTINUUM NEEDS TO BE FUNDED --

02:02:47.793 --> 02:02:50.529
THIS IS A MODEST INVESTMENT.

02:02:50.596 --> 02:02:52.898
AROUND IT RESTORES FUNDING TO

INFRASTRUCTURE OF SERVICES.

IF WE'RE GOING TO BUILD INTO

02:03:09.215 --> 02:03:11.617
ANYTHING THAT'S BETTER.

02:03:11.684 --> 02:03:14.386

LEGISLATIVE CO CHAIR.

02:03:23.796 --> 02:03:25.498
FOR CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF

02:03:25.564 --> 02:03:27.133
AREA AGENCIES ON AGING SOME

02:03:27.199 --> 02:03:29.001
BRING A COUPLE HATS -- FIRST OF

02:03:29.068 --> 02:03:30.369
ALL I JUST WANT TO REALLY THANK

02:03:30.436 --> 02:03:34.273
ASSEMBLYMAN CHIU AND WINDY

02:03:34.340 --> 02:03:35.040
PETERSON FOR THEIR PROPOSAL

02:03:35.107 --> 02:03:35.341
[inaudible]

02:03:35.407 --> 02:03:37.943
IT'S A IT SHOULD BE THE STARTING

02:03:38.010 --> 02:03:39.912
POINT THIS SHOULD BE THE MINIMUM

02:03:39.979 --> 02:03:41.981
THAT WE DO AND THIS IS HOW WE

02:03:42.047 --> 02:03:43.849
FIX WHAT IS LITERALLY A BROKEN

02:03:43.916 --> 02:03:44.550
SYSTEM.

02:03:44.617 --> 02:03:47.253
SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WE START

02:03:47.319 --> 02:03:49.321
BY FIXING WHAT WAS BROKEN TEN

02:03:49.388 --> 02:03:50.456
YEARS AGO.

02:03:50.523 --> 02:03:52.758
BY PUTTING BACKING AND WHAT WORK

02:03:52.825 --> 02:03:53.359
BEFORE.

02:03:53.425 --> 02:03:56.228
AND AFTER THAT THEN LET'S TALK

02:03:56.295 --> 02:03:57.763
ABOUT THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING

02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:59.265
SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL

02:03:59.331 --> 02:04:00.166
WITH THE GROWTH.

02:04:00.232 --> 02:04:01.801
IN THE POPULATION AND FIGURE OUT

02:04:01.867 --> 02:04:03.269
BETTER WAYS TO DO THINGS BUT I

02:04:03.335 --> 02:04:06.038
THINK THIS IS THE STARTING POINT.

02:04:06.105 --> 02:04:07.640
REGARDING THE NUTRITION ASK

02:04:07.706 --> 02:04:08.974
SPECIFICALLY.

02:04:09.041 --> 02:04:11.110
THERE'S NO STANDARD ABOUT HOW

02:04:11.177 --> 02:04:14.547
MANY SENIORS CAN GO HUNGRY.

02:04:14.613 --> 02:04:15.548
THERE'S NO PERCENTAGE --

02:04:15.614 --> 02:04:16.949
CALCULATION ABOUT WHAT'S

02:04:17.016 --> 02:04:18.184
ACCEPTABLE THERE'S NO

02:04:18.250 --> 02:04:19.952
CALCULATION ABOUT HOW MANY

02:04:20.019 --> 02:04:21.253
SENIOR SHOULD BE EATING DOG FOOD

02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:22.888
IN OUR COMMUNITY AND WE KNOW

02:04:22.955 --> 02:04:24.156
THAT IS HAPPENING.

02:04:24.223 --> 02:04:25.457
THAT'S REALLY WHAT DROVE THE

02:04:25.524 --> 02:04:27.827
CREATION OF OLDER AMERICANS ACT

02:04:27.893 --> 02:04:29.962
IT WENT AWAY FOR AWHILE BUT NOW

02:04:30.029 --> 02:04:31.630
WITH THE STAGNATION OF FUNDING

02:04:31.697 --> 02:04:33.432
OR THE LOSS OF FUNDING.

02:04:33.499 --> 02:04:34.834
THE D. INVESTMENTS.

02:04:34.900 --> 02:04:36.802
THAT'S BECOME A REALITY AGAIN

02:04:36.869 --> 02:04:38.037
AND WE'RE HEARING DIRECT STORIES

02:04:38.103 --> 02:04:39.038
IN OUR COMMUNITY ABOUT THAT

02:04:39.104 --> 02:04:40.673
HAPPENING.

02:04:40.739 --> 02:04:42.842
IT'S REALLY NOT OK.

02:04:42.908 --> 02:04:45.778
WE ALSO KNOW THERE IS ONE POINT

02:04:45.845 --> 02:04:47.012
TWO MILLION.

02:04:47.079 --> 02:04:49.982
SENIORS THAT ARE FOOD INSECURE.

02:04:50.049 --> 02:04:51.450
RIGHT NOW OUR MEAL PROGRAMS ARE

02:04:51.517 --> 02:04:53.118
FEEDING ABOUT A QUARTER OF A

02:04:53.185 --> 02:04:54.520
MILLION SENIORS PER YEAR

02:04:54.587 --> 02:04:54.820
[inaudible]

02:04:54.887 --> 02:04:56.455
SO.

02:04:56.522 --> 02:04:58.490
MY LACK OF ACTION AND BY NOT

02:04:58.557 --> 02:04:59.992
FUNDING THESE PROGRAMS WERE

02:05:00.059 --> 02:05:01.460
BASICALLY SAYING THAT THE

02:05:01.527 --> 02:05:03.162
STANDARD IS.

02:05:03.229 --> 02:05:05.865
THAT IT'S OKAY THAT 80% OF OUR

02:05:05.931 --> 02:05:09.034
AT RISK SENIORS GO HUNGRY.

02:05:09.101 --> 02:05:10.336
OR THE EAT POOR MEALS.

02:05:10.402 --> 02:05:13.739
AND THAT'S REALLY TO ME YOU KNOW

02:05:13.806 --> 02:05:15.674
I LOVE MY STATES BUT THAT'S AN

02:05:15.741 --> 02:05:17.810
EMBARRASSMENT THAT WERE SAYING

02:05:17.877 --> 02:05:19.645
THAT FOUR OUT OF FIVE SENIORS IN

02:05:19.712 --> 02:05:21.513
ME FACING HUNGER FACING THE

02:05:21.580 --> 02:05:23.282
CHOICE BETWEEN A MEAL.

02:05:23.349 --> 02:05:25.751
AND THEIR MEDICATION OR OTHER

02:05:25.818 --> 02:05:27.052
ESSENTIAL.

02:05:27.119 --> 02:05:29.889
MY SUSTAINING ACTIVITIES THAT

02:05:29.955 --> 02:05:33.359
THEY HAVE TO GO WITHOUT FOOD.

02:05:33.425 --> 02:05:35.160
PROGRAMS I MENTIONED EARLIER

02:05:35.227 --> 02:05:36.795
HAVE SURVIVED BY.

02:05:36.862 --> 02:05:39.732
CREATIVE APPROACHES TO KEEPING

02:05:39.798 --> 02:05:41.267
THEIR PROGRAMS OPEN.

02:05:41.333 --> 02:05:44.370
BY NOT PAYING STAFF WAGE

02:05:44.436 --> 02:05:47.339
INCREASES FOR A DECADE.

02:05:47.406 --> 02:05:49.041
AND WHAT WE DO WITH THAT IS WE

02:05:49.108 --> 02:05:51.310
CREATE A POVERTY REALITY FOR

02:05:51.377 --> 02:05:52.912
EVERYBODY PROVIDING THESE TYPES

02:05:52.978 --> 02:05:54.480
OF SERVICES IF YOU WANT TO DO

02:05:54.546 --> 02:05:55.681
GOOD IN YOUR COMMUNITY AND SERVE

02:05:55.748 --> 02:05:57.082
SENIORS.

02:05:57.149 --> 02:05:58.717
AND YOU'RE A STAFFER.

02:05:58.784 --> 02:05:59.785
YOU HAVE TO DECIDE THAT YOU'RE

02:05:59.852 --> 02:06:01.420
GOING TO TAKE A VOW OF POVERTY

02:06:01.487 --> 02:06:03.889
YOURSELF AND END UP MEETING THE

02:06:03.956 --> 02:06:06.025
SAME SERVICES THAT YOU'RE TRYING

02:06:06.091 --> 02:06:07.559
TO HELP THE COMMUNITY.

02:06:07.626 --> 02:06:09.295
RECEIVING HALF.

02:06:09.361 --> 02:06:11.263
AND THAT'S NOT OKAY.

02:06:11.330 --> 02:06:12.364
AND I THINK ALL OF US AND I

02:06:12.431 --> 02:06:14.800
APPRECIATE THIS COMMITTEE HAVING

02:06:14.867 --> 02:06:17.036
PASSING AROUND THESE ISSUES.

02:06:17.102 --> 02:06:19.204
AND IT'S IT'S REFRESHING TO SEE

02:06:19.271 --> 02:06:21.373
THAT THERE'S PASSION HERE ABOUT

02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:23.208
DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

02:06:23.275 --> 02:06:25.744
WE ALSO HAVE FEWER PROVIDERS

02:06:25.811 --> 02:06:27.413
THAT WE CAN FIND TO GET SERVICES

02:06:27.479 --> 02:06:29.281
FROM MANY OF OUR CONTRACT TO

02:06:29.348 --> 02:06:30.849
PROVIDERS ARE JUST BREAKING

02:06:30.916 --> 02:06:33.319
CONTRACTS OR SAYING NO MORE

02:06:33.385 --> 02:06:35.087
BECAUSE THEY CANNOT CONTINUE TO

02:06:35.154 --> 02:06:36.288
MEET THE NEED.

02:06:36.355 --> 02:06:38.090
ON THE POOR REIMBURSEMENT RATE

02:06:38.157 --> 02:06:40.159
THE TRIPLE A.'S OR OTHER FUNDING

02:06:40.225 --> 02:06:41.894
SOURCES ARE PROVIDING.

02:06:41.961 --> 02:06:44.063
AND I THINK WE NEED TO THINK

02:06:44.129 --> 02:06:46.498
ABOUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENS NOT

02:06:46.565 --> 02:06:47.933
ONLY WHEN SOMEBODY DOESN'T GET A

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:49.601
MEAL I THINK THAT PART IS EASY

02:06:49.668 --> 02:06:50.269
TO GRASP.

02:06:50.336 --> 02:06:53.372
WE HAVE DATA AND AND A LOT OF

02:06:53.439 --> 02:06:55.174
INFORMATION ABOUT HOW.

02:06:55.240 --> 02:06:56.909
POOR NUTRITION LEADS TO

02:06:56.976 --> 02:06:58.677
INCREASED HEALTH COSTS INCREASED

02:06:58.744 --> 02:07:00.646
INSTITUTIONALIZATION INCREASE

02:07:00.713 --> 02:07:03.215
STROKES INCREASED HEART ATTACKS

02:07:03.282 --> 02:07:04.783
NONE OF WHICH IS OKAY.

02:07:04.850 --> 02:07:06.885
BUT THE CUTS PROGRAMS ARE BEING

02:07:06.952 --> 02:07:09.355
FACED TO MATE.

02:07:09.421 --> 02:07:11.590
OUR DRASTIC AND I DON'T THINK WE

02:07:11.657 --> 02:07:13.158
HEAR ABOUT THOSE IN EARLIER I

02:07:13.225 --> 02:07:15.627
MENTIONED THE ISSUE OF ONE

02:07:15.694 --> 02:07:17.496
STRATEGY IS RATHER THAN VISITING

02:07:17.563 --> 02:07:19.798
AT SENIOR EVERY DAY WITH THE

02:07:19.865 --> 02:07:21.066
HOME DELIVERED MEALS.

02:07:21.133 --> 02:07:22.401
A LOT OF PROGRAMS ARE UNDER

02:07:22.468 --> 02:07:24.770
PRESSURE TO DELIVER FROZEN MEALS

02:07:24.837 --> 02:07:26.105
BE THERE ONCE A WEEK OR OR

02:07:26.171 --> 02:07:27.406
WHATEVER AND ONE OF OUR LOCAL

02:07:27.473 --> 02:07:29.475
PROGRAMS IS FACING THAT RIGHT

02:07:29.541 --> 02:07:30.042
NOW.

02:07:30.109 --> 02:07:31.410
THERE ARE DISCUSSION SHOULD THEY

02:07:31.477 --> 02:07:34.680
START PROVIDING FROZEN MEALS AND

02:07:34.747 --> 02:07:36.015
VISIT ONCE A WEEK OR NOT.

02:07:36.081 --> 02:07:38.751
AND THIS LAST YEAR DURING ONE OF

02:07:38.817 --> 02:07:40.352
THEIR HOME VISITS AND DELIVERIES

02:07:40.419 --> 02:07:43.122
THEY FOUND A CLIENT LYING ON THE

02:07:43.188 --> 02:07:45.657
FLOOR IN HER OWN WAY STE WHO'D

02:07:45.724 --> 02:07:47.426
BEEN THERE SINCE ABOUT TEN

02:07:47.493 --> 02:07:48.827
O'CLOCK THE NIGHT BEFORE.

02:07:48.894 --> 02:07:51.797
SHE HAD FALLEN COULDN'T GET UP.

02:07:51.864 --> 02:07:54.066
AND LUCKILY WAS RESCUED BY HER

02:07:54.133 --> 02:07:55.567
DRIVER WHO SAW THIS AND CALLED

02:07:55.634 --> 02:07:57.870
AUTHORITIES AND SHE WAS ABLE TO

02:07:57.936 --> 02:07:59.805
BE TAKEN TO A HOSPITAL IN

02:07:59.872 --> 02:08:01.874
REHYDRATED IN AND BASICALLY

02:08:01.940 --> 02:08:03.809
RECOVERED AND CONTINUES.

02:08:03.876 --> 02:08:05.210
TO LIVE AT HOME TODAY.

02:08:05.277 --> 02:08:07.746
NOW IF THIS PROVIDER HAS TO CUT

02:08:07.813 --> 02:08:10.215
CORNERS ONE MORE TIME AND ONLY

02:08:10.282 --> 02:08:12.351
DELIVER MEALS ONCE A WEEK THAT

02:08:12.418 --> 02:08:13.852
PERSON WOULD BE DEAD.

02:08:13.919 --> 02:08:15.354
IN AND THAT'S THE REALITY IN THE

02:08:15.421 --> 02:08:16.855
CHOICE THEY WERE PUTTING OUR

02:08:16.922 --> 02:08:18.424
PROVIDERS IN.

02:08:18.490 --> 02:08:20.225
THE EITHER HAVE TO KNOW THAT A

02:08:20.292 --> 02:08:22.661
SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THOSE THEY

02:08:22.728 --> 02:08:24.163
SERVE WILL DIE.

02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:26.198
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO STOP MAKING

02:08:26.265 --> 02:08:28.667
DAILY DELIVERIES OR A LARGER

TRYING.

02:12:48.727 --> 02:12:50.595
TO MAKE THAT CORRELATION ABOUT

02:12:50.662 --> 02:12:52.464
HOW MUCH MONEY WE SAVE UP BY

02:12:52.531 --> 02:12:54.399
FEEDING THESE FOLKS AND MY LONG

02:12:54.466 --> 02:12:56.134
TERM GOAL AND YOU KNOW THIS IS A

02:12:56.201 --> 02:12:58.103
PIE IN THE SKY TYPE OF GOAL IS

02:12:58.170 --> 02:12:58.704
THAT.

02:12:58.770 --> 02:13:00.005
YOU KNOW AT SOME POINT --

02:13:00.072 --> 02:13:02.841
NUTRITION IS MEDICATION SO THAT

02:13:02.908 --> 02:13:05.277
DOCTORS ARE ABLE TO PRESCRIBE

02:13:05.344 --> 02:13:06.678
NUTRITIOUS FOOD.

02:13:06.745 --> 02:13:10.048
AS PART OF A A RECOVERY --

02:13:10.115 --> 02:13:11.383
PROGRAM AND I THINK.

02:13:11.450 --> 02:13:14.186
IF WE THOUGHT ABOUT FOOD AS

02:13:14.252 --> 02:13:16.088
MEDICATION THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE

02:13:16.154 --> 02:13:17.823
THESE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE NOW

02:13:17.889 --> 02:13:19.124
AND HOPEFULLY.

02:13:19.191 --> 02:13:23.328
AGAIN PLAN THIS GUY A TYPE OF

02:13:23.395 --> 02:13:24.196
THINKING BUT IF DOCTORS WERE

02:13:24.262 --> 02:13:24.963
ABLE TO PRESCRIBE AND WE WOULD

02:13:25.030 --> 02:13:27.132
SPEND THE MONEY ON FOOD THAT WE

02:13:27.199 --> 02:13:28.266
DO ONE MEDICATION I THINK THEY

02:13:28.333 --> 02:13:29.634
WOULD BE YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT

02:13:29.701 --> 02:13:33.505
WE COULD -- ALL GET AROUND -- OR

02:13:33.572 --> 02:13:35.674
SUPPORT -- I THINK WE ALL SEE

02:13:35.741 --> 02:13:37.342
THAT WE SUPPORTED BUT IF WE

02:13:37.409 --> 02:13:41.113
DON'T SEE ANY DATA -- TO WE HAVE

02:13:41.179 --> 02:13:43.315
THE DATA BUT IF WE DON'T LOOK AT

02:13:43.382 --> 02:13:46.518
IT LIKE OUR BUDGET FOLKS LOOK AT

02:13:46.585 --> 02:13:48.253
IT AS A LINE ITEM ISSUE AS

02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:50.288
OPPOSED TO A YOU KNOW FEEL GOOD

02:13:50.355 --> 02:13:51.056
ISSUE.

02:13:51.123 --> 02:13:54.326
BOB WE'RE NOT GOING TO EVER --

02:13:54.393 --> 02:13:56.228
CONTINUE THE FUNDING WITHOUT

02:13:56.294 --> 02:13:57.963
HAVING TO CUT IT AND YOU KNOW

02:13:58.029 --> 02:13:59.698
AND THE DON DOWNTURN.

02:13:59.765 --> 02:14:02.734
ECONOMIC TIMES BUT ANYWAY SO I

02:14:02.801 --> 02:14:05.470
DID SOME FOOD DELIVERY AND JUST

02:14:05.537 --> 02:14:07.205
TO SEE THE REACTION FROM THE

02:14:07.272 --> 02:14:10.142
FOLKS THAT ARE BEING -- VISITED.

02:14:10.208 --> 02:14:11.343
YOU KNOW ONE COMPONENT IS THE

02:14:11.410 --> 02:14:13.044
FOOD BUT THE ACTUAL HUMAN

02:14:13.111 --> 02:14:14.513
CONTACT.

02:14:14.579 --> 02:14:16.615
ESPECIALLY FOR THE THE ELDERLY

02:14:16.681 --> 02:14:18.784
POPULATION IS JUST AS CRITICAL

02:14:18.850 --> 02:14:20.252
AS THE NUTRITION THAT THE

02:14:20.318 --> 02:14:22.320
RECEIVING AND SAW IT.

02:14:22.387 --> 02:14:24.022
I KNOW I'M SPEAKING TO THE CHOIR

02:14:24.089 --> 02:14:25.991
BUT THE THESE PROGRAMS ARE

02:14:26.057 --> 02:14:27.292
CRITICAL BUT I THINK IN THE LONG

02:14:27.359 --> 02:14:28.293
TERM.

02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:32.063
A YOU KNOW BUDGETARY -- LOOK IS

02:14:32.130 --> 02:14:33.899
THERE GOING TO SAVE US MONEY BY

02:14:33.965 --> 02:14:36.835
PROVIDING -- THESE PROGRAMS AND

02:14:36.902 --> 02:14:38.670
THE AND THE FOOD TO TO THE

02:14:38.737 --> 02:14:40.539
ELDERLY BECAUSE IF NOT WE'RE

02:14:40.605 --> 02:14:42.274
GOING TO HAVE FOLKS THAT ARE

02:14:42.340 --> 02:14:44.209
FALLING OR NOT BEING RESCUED

02:14:44.276 --> 02:14:45.844
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BUY A HOUSE

02:14:45.911 --> 02:14:47.846
THEM AND THEN -- RESIDENTIAL

02:14:47.913 --> 02:14:49.247
CARE FACILITIES ARE GOING TO

02:14:49.314 --> 02:14:51.316
COST MUCH MORE SO I HOPE BUT

02:14:51.383 --> 02:14:53.051
THAT THAT AT SOME POINT WE GET

02:14:53.118 --> 02:14:55.053
TO THE POINT WHERE WE'RE LOOKING

02:14:55.120 --> 02:14:56.988
AT THESE AS PREVENTION.

02:14:57.055 --> 02:14:59.958
OF PREVENTATIVE OF MEASURES SO

02:15:00.025 --> 02:15:01.827
THAT WEEK IF WE LOOK AT IT IS

02:15:01.893 --> 02:15:02.961
THAT BUDGETARY ISSUE WE'RE

02:15:03.028 --> 02:15:04.563
SAVING MONEY IN THE LONG RUN.

02:15:04.629 --> 02:15:06.898
AND SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN WORK

02:15:06.965 --> 02:15:08.633
TOGETHER TO TRY AND MAKE THESE.

02:15:08.700 --> 02:15:10.502
ONGOING FUNDING NOD ONE TIME AND

02:15:10.569 --> 02:15:11.670
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP

02:15:11.736 --> 02:15:13.271
COMING BACK EVERY SINGLE TIME

02:15:13.338 --> 02:15:16.007
BECAUSE FOR US IF WE LOOK AT

02:15:16.074 --> 02:15:17.542
LINE ITEMS.

02:15:17.609 --> 02:15:19.578
IT'S ONE THING BUT IF WE LOOK AT

02:15:19.644 --> 02:15:20.111
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE BEING

02:15:20.178 --> 02:15:21.313
AFFECTED.

BUDGETARY HATS TOGETHER -- YOU

02:16:55.607 --> 02:16:56.675

02:16:56.741 --> 02:16:59.110
GOVERNOR TO MAKE THAT AN ISSUE

02:16:59.177 --> 02:17:02.213
THAT IS PART OF THIS ONGOING --

02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:03.448
PREVENTION.

02:17:03.515 --> 02:17:05.584
OF METHODS THAT WE ARE ALL

02:17:05.650 --> 02:17:07.519
LOOKING FOR TO HELP THE SENIOR

02:17:07.586 --> 02:17:09.120

GET.

02:17:13.358 --> 02:17:14.359
FOOD AS A PRESCRIPTION I THINK

02:17:14.426 --> 02:17:15.694
THAT WOULD HELP NOT JUST THE

02:17:15.760 --> 02:17:17.095
ELDERLY POPULATION BUT ALL OF

INTO THE WHOLE DIABETES ISSUE

02:17:19.965 --> 02:17:21.967
BUT THAT WOULD BE FOR ANOTHER

02:17:22.033 --> 02:17:23.368
CONVERSATION BUT I THINK IF WE

02:17:23.435 --> 02:17:26.037
THOUGHT OF FOOD AS AS PREVENTION

02:17:26.104 --> 02:17:27.072
AND HIS MEDICATION AND THAT.

02:17:27.138 --> 02:17:29.641
WE WE WOULD BE ALL HAPPY TO

02:17:29.708 --> 02:17:31.376

THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING.

02:17:36.448 --> 02:17:37.916
AND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WE'RE

02:17:37.983 --> 02:17:39.184
THINKING OUTSIDE OF THE BOX

02:17:39.250 --> 02:17:41.119
BECAUSE WE KNOW WE HAVE TO FIND

02:17:41.186 --> 02:17:42.187
A SOLUTION.

02:17:42.253 --> 02:17:44.856
ALASKA NOW ALLOWS DOCTORS TO

02:17:44.923 --> 02:17:46.224
PRESCRIBE HOUSING.

02:17:46.291 --> 02:17:48.526
SO IF HOUSING IF THE DOCTOR

02:17:48.593 --> 02:17:51.796
COULD BRING OUT HIS HIS --

02:17:51.863 --> 02:17:53.832
PRESCRIPTION PAD AND SAY THIS

02:17:53.898 --> 02:17:56.534
PERSON NEEDS HOUSING THAN

02:17:56.601 --> 02:17:58.269
ABSOLUTELY THE EVEN TO A GREATER

02:17:58.336 --> 02:17:59.537
DEGREE THEY NEED TO HAVE FOOD

02:17:59.604 --> 02:18:01.272
THEY NEED TO TUITION.

02:18:01.339 --> 02:18:02.774
SO THINKING OUTSIDE OF THE BOX

02:18:02.841 --> 02:18:04.576

TOTALLY AGREE WITH WHAT BOTH OF

02:18:11.983 --> 02:18:12.851
YOU ARE SAYING AND JUST ONE

02:18:12.917 --> 02:18:15.086
SUGGESTED AROUND THAT IS TO LOOK

02:18:15.153 --> 02:18:17.522
AT ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVERS WHICH

02:18:17.589 --> 02:18:18.890

MEDICAID DOLLARS TO BE USED FOR

02:18:22.060 --> 02:18:23.428
NON MEDICAL.

02:18:23.495 --> 02:18:24.896
CARE AND THAT WOULD BRING IN

02:18:24.963 --> 02:18:26.464
FEDERAL DOLLARS TO IT WOULDN'T

02:18:26.531 --> 02:18:28.900

02:18:32.737 --> 02:18:34.005
THAT COULD BE A REAL CREATIVE

02:18:34.072 --> 02:18:35.940

SIDES WE CAN GET SOME DATA THAT

02:18:44.816 --> 02:18:46.851

I'M JUST NOT FAMILIAR RIGHT NOW

02:22:22.033 --> 02:22:25.536
WITH KIND OF HOW TO BUILD.

02:22:25.603 --> 02:22:27.739
ONE WELL THERE'S SOME TALK ABOUT

02:22:27.805 --> 02:22:30.541
THE WAITING LIST.

02:22:30.608 --> 02:22:34.012
DO WE HAVE A GOOD GRASP ON WHAT

02:22:34.078 --> 02:22:36.047
THIS WAITING LIST IS.

02:22:36.114 --> 02:22:39.751
THE AMOUNT ON THE WAITING LIST.

02:22:39.817 --> 02:22:43.288
NOT ALL TRIPLE A.'S ARE FOR AREA

02:22:43.354 --> 02:22:44.555
AGENCIES ON AGING A RECALL.

SOME DON'T SO THE INFORMATION

02:22:51.896 --> 02:22:54.532
THE ONE WITH HALF AROUND WAITING

02:22:54.599 --> 02:22:55.700
LISTS WOULD.

02:22:55.767 --> 02:22:58.002
VERY ACROSS SYRIA AS AN

02:22:58.069 --> 02:23:00.505
PROVIDERS SO YOU COULD HAVE

02:23:00.571 --> 02:23:02.206
PARTIAL INFORMATION.

02:23:02.273 --> 02:23:03.474
BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU A

02:23:03.541 --> 02:23:08.146
PICTURE OF WHAT OF WAITING LISTS

02:23:08.212 --> 02:23:09.547

02:23:11.516 --> 02:23:13.484
PROVIDERS AND AREA AGENCIES TO

02:23:13.551 --> 02:23:15.753
KEEP THAT INFORMATION TO SHARE

02:23:15.820 --> 02:23:17.455
ABOUT BUT IT'S NOT.

02:23:17.522 --> 02:23:19.991
A REQUIREMENT ACROSS THE PROGRAM.

02:23:20.058 --> 02:23:21.359
DO THE LOCAL PLANS GIVE US THAT

02:23:21.426 --> 02:23:23.294
INFORMATION.

02:23:23.361 --> 02:23:24.662
OF THE LOW.

02:23:24.729 --> 02:23:25.997
WE'D HAVE TO LOOK AT THE LOCAL

02:23:26.064 --> 02:23:28.800
PLAN SPECIFICALLY FOR THE HOT.

02:23:28.866 --> 02:23:31.402
IT'S CERTAINLY CONCEIVABLE THAT

02:23:31.469 --> 02:23:33.805
CERTAIN PLANS WOULD CERTAIN

02:23:33.871 --> 02:23:36.474

MAY NOT SHOW UP IN A AN AREA

02:23:41.212 --> 02:23:42.780
PLAN BECAUSE IT'S NOT REQUIRED

02:23:42.847 --> 02:23:45.883

02:23:45.950 --> 02:23:47.852
SHOULD BE REQUIRED.

02:23:47.919 --> 02:23:52.323
I THINK THAT THERE WOULD BE.

02:23:52.390 --> 02:23:54.926
THAT THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION TASK

02:23:54.993 --> 02:23:55.827
WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT

02:23:55.893 --> 02:23:59.364
RESOURCES FOR PROVIDERS WHO ARE.

02:23:59.430 --> 02:24:01.165
STRUGGLING.

02:24:06.504 --> 02:24:07.905
THERE IT BUT THERE ARE CONCERNS

02:24:07.972 --> 02:24:10.208
ABOUT ENABLING PROVIDERS TO

REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE GOING TO

02:24:16.647 --> 02:24:18.349
BE BURDENSOME TO THEM UNLESS

02:24:18.416 --> 02:24:20.451
THEY HAVE THE FUNDING TO MEET

02:24:20.518 --> 02:24:22.086
THOSE REQUIREMENTS.

02:24:22.153 --> 02:24:24.455

RESOURCE TO DO THAT.

02:24:37.235 --> 02:24:38.603
I UNDERSTAND THAT IF WE'RE

02:24:38.669 --> 02:24:41.172
TRYING TO DETERMINE HOW MANY OF

02:24:41.239 --> 02:24:43.574
OUR SENIORS ARE NOT RECEIVING

02:24:43.641 --> 02:24:45.143

THEY MAY BE LOW INCOME THEY MAY

02:25:09.400 --> 02:25:12.203

THERE ARE A VARIETY OF SERVICES

02:25:15.940 --> 02:25:17.642
THAT A FACT [inaudible]

ABILITY OF PEOPLE L. WHO.

02:25:44.702 --> 02:25:46.604
SOLD ME SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS

02:25:46.671 --> 02:25:48.706
THERE IS THERE IS NOT A SIMPLE

02:25:48.773 --> 02:25:51.075
ANSWER TO THE QUESTION OF HOW DO

TRY TO GET OUT UNMET NEED.

02:26:04.555 --> 02:26:06.791
IN OLDER AMERICANS ACT NUTRITION

02:26:06.858 --> 02:26:09.026
PROGRAMS.

02:26:09.093 --> 02:26:12.063
WHAT THEY DID IS THEY LOOKED AT?

02:26:12.130 --> 02:26:13.564
THE DATA FROM THE CURRENT

02:26:13.631 --> 02:26:15.967
POPULATION STUDY.

02:26:16.033 --> 02:26:18.603
AND THEY'VE TRIED TO UNDERSTAND

02:26:18.669 --> 02:26:21.506
AMONG LOW INCOME ADULTS.

02:26:21.572 --> 02:26:23.975
WHAT WERE THEY RECEIVING?

02:26:24.041 --> 02:26:26.043
WITH REGARDS TO SERVICES THAT

02:26:26.110 --> 02:26:29.013
WERE SIMILAR.

02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:32.683
TO OLDER AMERICANS ACT TITLE.

02:26:32.750 --> 02:26:34.519
THREE NUTRITION SERVICES.

02:26:34.585 --> 02:26:37.455
OF WHAT THEY FOUND A THEIR THEIR

02:26:37.522 --> 02:26:39.157

IT'S THAT WERE BELOW A HUNDRED

02:26:44.095 --> 02:26:46.364
AND 85% OF POVERTY.

02:26:46.430 --> 02:26:47.899
SO THEY COULDN'T BE GENERALIZED

02:26:47.965 --> 02:26:51.936
TO THE POPULATION OF PERSONS WHO

02:26:52.003 --> 02:26:53.237
MIGHT HAVE.

02:26:53.304 --> 02:26:55.006
A LITTLE MORE RESOURCES.

02:26:55.072 --> 02:26:57.508
AND WHAT THEY FOUND THAT THEY

02:26:57.575 --> 02:26:59.343
CAME UP WITH AN ESTIMATE THAT

02:26:59.410 --> 02:27:02.647
90% OF LOW INCOME OLDER ADULTS.

02:27:02.713 --> 02:27:04.916
DID NOT RECEIVE MEAL SERVICES

02:27:04.982 --> 02:27:07.051
LIKE THOSE FUNDED.

02:27:07.118 --> 02:27:10.321

ADULTS WHO WERE FOOD IN SECURE

02:27:20.031 --> 02:27:20.865
WERE.

02:27:20.932 --> 02:27:25.469
AS MEASURED BY SUCH THINGS AS OF

02:27:25.536 --> 02:27:28.172
WORRYING ABOUT FOOD.

02:27:28.239 --> 02:27:29.707
SKIPPING MEALS BECAUSE THERE

02:27:29.774 --> 02:27:32.176
WASN'T ENOUGH MONEY FOR FOOD.

02:27:32.243 --> 02:27:33.878
OR NOT EATING FOR A WHOLE DAY

02:28:03.441 --> 02:28:05.610
FOREIGN EXCHANGE UNITS IN HIGH

02:28:05.676 --> 02:28:05.977
SCHOOL I KNOW.

02:28:06.043 --> 02:28:10.047
HE NEEDS. TEN DOLLARS A DAY FOR

02:28:10.114 --> 02:28:11.515
LAUNCH.

02:28:11.582 --> 02:28:12.650
IT'S FIVE DAYS A WEEK THAT FIFTY

02:28:12.717 --> 02:28:13.217
BUCKS A WEEK THE THESE ARE

02:28:13.284 --> 02:28:14.785
SIMPLE MULTIPLICATION PROBLEMS

02:28:14.852 --> 02:28:16.354
OF MY NINE YEARS OLDS COULD

02:28:16.420 --> 02:28:17.655
FIGURE OUT.

02:28:17.722 --> 02:28:19.357
SO I'M VERY FRUSTRATED WITH THAT

02:28:19.423 --> 02:28:20.725
AND THE FACT THAT IN THE SCHOOL

02:28:20.791 --> 02:28:22.393
SYSTEM WE FIGURED OUT FREE AND

02:28:22.460 --> 02:28:25.263
REDUCED BREAKFAST AND LUNCH FOR

02:28:25.329 --> 02:28:26.897
ALL OF OUR KIDS REGARDLESS.

02:28:26.964 --> 02:28:30.034
OF THEIR INCOME BRACKETS.

02:28:30.101 --> 02:28:31.769
MAYBE TALKING OF THE DEPARTMENT

02:28:31.836 --> 02:28:33.871
OF HEALTH. TO FIGURE SOME OF

02:28:33.938 --> 02:28:35.339
THIS OUT -- THEN YOU GUYS THIS

02:28:35.406 --> 02:28:36.807
ISN'T ROCKET SCIENCE.

02:28:36.874 --> 02:28:37.875
AND I THINK ALL MEMBERS ARE

02:28:37.942 --> 02:28:39.477
EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED AND I THINK

02:28:39.543 --> 02:28:41.379
THE PUBLIC EVEN MORE FRUSTRATED

02:28:41.445 --> 02:28:42.546
ABOUT THIS.

02:28:42.613 --> 02:28:43.414
BUT IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT FREE

02:28:43.481 --> 02:28:46.751
AND REDUCED LUNCH IN OUR SCHOOLS.

02:28:46.817 --> 02:28:48.052
WE WE ALREADY HAVE DEPARTMENTS

02:28:48.119 --> 02:28:50.988
DOING THIS TALK TO EACH OTHER.

02:28:51.055 --> 02:28:52.690
PLEASE WELL.

02:28:52.757 --> 02:28:54.025
I I WILL SAY.

02:28:54.091 --> 02:28:57.128
THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING.

02:28:57.194 --> 02:28:59.397
HAS WITHIN THE RESOURCES THAT WE

02:28:59.463 --> 02:29:01.666
HAVE.

02:29:01.732 --> 02:29:04.068
TRY TO ADDRESS ISSUES OF FOOD IN

02:29:04.135 --> 02:29:06.137
SECURITY THROUGH COLLABORATIONS

02:29:06.203 --> 02:29:08.039
WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS.

02:29:08.105 --> 02:29:10.007
WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK AROUND

02:29:10.074 --> 02:29:12.910
CAL FRESH OUT REACH.

02:29:12.977 --> 02:29:14.779
WE'RE WORKING RIGHT NOW WITH THE

02:29:14.845 --> 02:29:16.147
DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SOCIAL

02:29:16.213 --> 02:29:18.015
SERVICES IN THE AREA AGENCIES ON

02:29:18.082 --> 02:29:21.552
AGING TO WORK ON SS I CASH OUT --

02:29:21.619 --> 02:29:27.425

ADDRESS ISSUES OF FOOD IN

02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:31.262
SECURITY FOR AWHILE.

02:29:31.329 --> 02:29:34.265
ALL I'M SAYING IS GETTING OUT AN

02:29:34.332 --> 02:29:38.135
EXACT PERCENTAGE OF UNMET NEED.

02:29:38.202 --> 02:29:40.604
IN IN MY OPINION PERHAPS THAT'S

02:29:40.671 --> 02:29:43.407
NOT AS IMPORTANT IS RECOGNIZING

02:29:43.474 --> 02:29:44.642
THAT THERE'S NEED.

02:29:44.709 --> 02:29:46.310
BUT I THINK IF WE'RE GOING TO

02:29:46.377 --> 02:29:47.745
PUT MONEY.

02:29:47.812 --> 02:29:50.281
WE ALL KNOW THERE'S NEED RIGHT.

02:29:50.348 --> 02:29:52.850
ARE WE ALL KNOW IT.

02:29:52.917 --> 02:29:56.320
AND I A SHE EIGHT MR MATHIS'S

02:29:56.387 --> 02:29:58.289
COMMENT.

02:29:58.356 --> 02:29:59.957
WE REALLY DO NEED TO KNOW WHAT

02:30:00.024 --> 02:30:01.492
THE NEED IS BECAUSE IF WE'RE

02:30:01.559 --> 02:30:02.960
GOING TO PUT THE MONEY FOR GOING

02:30:03.027 --> 02:30:04.528
TO BUDGET THIS.

I THINK IF YOU HAD THE

02:32:54.498 --> 02:32:57.434
IMPRESSION THAT ANYBODY HERE ON

02:32:57.501 --> 02:32:58.636

02:33:03.040 --> 02:33:04.608
NOBODY IS ASKING FOR AN EXACT

02:33:04.675 --> 02:33:05.876

DISABILITY.

03:07:58.333 --> 03:07:59.835
IN A SURVEY THAT WE RECENTLY

03:07:59.901 --> 03:08:01.269
CONDUCTED AMONG THE EMESIS P.

03:08:15.217 --> 03:08:16.318
WE WERE WILLING TO HELP WITH

03:08:16.385 --> 03:08:17.619
THIS AGING DILEMMA THAT WE'RE

03:08:17.686 --> 03:08:19.354
FACING AND THE WIND ONE OF THE

03:08:19.421 --> 03:08:20.288
WAYS THAT WE DO THAT IS

03:08:28.930 --> 03:08:30.599
WE PREVENT AND DELAY NURSING

03:08:30.666 --> 03:08:31.833
HOME PLACEMENT BY USING

03:08:31.900 --> 03:08:33.602
COMMUNITY BASED SUPPORT

03:08:33.669 --> 03:08:36.505
ALTERNATIVES SUCH AS I HSS.

03:08:36.571 --> 03:08:38.106
ANSWERED MEALS ON WHEELS.

03:08:38.173 --> 03:08:40.142

AND WE OFFER PROFESSIONAL STAFF

03:08:41.643 --> 03:08:43.512
THAT CONSIST OF REGISTERED

03:08:43.578 --> 03:08:45.313
NURSES AND SOCIAL WORKERS WHO

03:08:45.380 --> 03:08:47.416
EVALUATE THE BENEFICIARY'S NEEDS

03:08:47.482 --> 03:08:49.117
AND HELP THEM ACCESS A NETWORK

03:08:49.184 --> 03:08:51.353
OF COMMUNITY BASED RESOURCES.

03:08:51.420 --> 03:08:52.254
THAT INCLUDE MEDICAL

INTERVENTIONS AND ADDRESS

03:08:54.089 --> 03:08:56.124
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES

03:08:56.191 --> 03:08:58.360
THAT IMPACT ONCE HELL.

03:08:58.427 --> 03:08:59.394
THE SUPPLEMENTAL INCREASE THAT

03:08:59.461 --> 03:09:01.430
WE'RE REQUESTING WOULD BE SPREAD

03:09:01.496 --> 03:09:03.198
OVER THREE YEARS.

03:09:03.265 --> 03:09:06.802
A FIRST YEAR 25% INCREASE IN THE

03:09:06.868 --> 03:09:10.138
BASE -- RATES -- WOULD MAKE UP

03:09:10.205 --> 03:09:11.540
FOR THE RATE OF INFLATION

03:09:11.606 --> 03:09:13.675
BETWEEN TWENTY AND SEVENTEEN

03:09:13.742 --> 03:09:14.710
TWENTY SIX AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN

03:09:14.776 --> 03:09:17.145
AND THAT WOULD BE A 25% INCREASE.

03:09:17.212 --> 03:09:18.647
THAT WOULD ALLOW THE EMPHASIS P.

03:09:18.714 --> 03:09:20.782
SITES TO REBUILD AND TO

03:09:20.849 --> 03:09:22.551
STABILIZE THE PROGRAMS THAT.

03:09:22.617 --> 03:09:23.819
HAVE NOT SEEN A RATE INCREASE AS

03:09:23.885 --> 03:09:25.520
YOU SAID FOR THIRTEEN YEARS AND

03:09:25.587 --> 03:09:27.189
IN THAT THIRTEEN YEARS WE'VE

03:09:27.255 --> 03:09:29.024
ALSO EXPERT EXPERIENCE TO BUDGET

03:09:29.091 --> 03:09:31.793
CUTS TO TOTAL TWENTY TWO AND A

03:09:31.860 --> 03:09:32.928
HALF PERCENT.

03:09:32.994 --> 03:09:35.130
SO THESE BUDGET CUTS IMPOSED AN

03:09:35.197 --> 03:09:39.134
ONGOING STATEWIDE REDUCTION OF

03:09:39.201 --> 03:09:40.168
220-004-0090 SEVEN IMUS'S PIECE

03:09:40.235 --> 03:09:41.136
LOTS.

03:09:41.203 --> 03:09:43.271
SO WE ARE DOWN FROM WHERE WE

03:09:43.338 --> 03:09:44.906
WERE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX THE

03:09:44.973 --> 03:09:47.109
SPENDING PROPOSAL RESTORE 50% OF

03:09:47.175 --> 03:09:49.611
THOSE SLOTS IN YOUR TO AND THE

03:09:49.678 --> 03:09:52.214
OTHER 50% IN YOUR THREE BRING

03:09:52.280 --> 03:09:54.483
CALIFORNIA BACK TO PRE RECESSION

03:09:54.549 --> 03:09:57.152
CAPACITY OF ELEVEN THOUSAND

03:09:57.219 --> 03:09:57.753
SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE

03:09:57.819 --> 03:09:58.787
SLOTS.

03:09:58.854 --> 03:10:00.822
KEEP IN MIND THAT WE THAT IS NOT

03:10:00.889 --> 03:10:02.591
A ONE FOR ONE THAT WE OFTEN HAVE

03:10:02.657 --> 03:10:04.292
CLIENTS THAT REVOLVE OFF THE

03:10:04.359 --> 03:10:05.861
PROGRAM SO WE FIGURED THAT

03:10:05.927 --> 03:10:07.863
THAT'S LOOKING AT ALMOST.

03:10:07.929 --> 03:10:09.197
FOURTEEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS

03:10:09.264 --> 03:10:11.600
THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO SERVE.

03:10:11.666 --> 03:10:13.101
IN THIS IT ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY

03:10:13.168 --> 03:10:15.203
REDUCE OUR WEIGHTLESS WHICH IS

03:10:15.270 --> 03:10:17.672
CURRENTLY AT FIFTEEN HUNDRED

03:10:17.739 --> 03:10:18.640
STATEWIDE.

03:10:18.707 --> 03:10:20.642
AND THAT'S WITHOUT HAVING ANY

03:10:20.709 --> 03:10:22.377
KIND OF AGGRESSIVE.

03:10:22.444 --> 03:10:24.713
RECRUITMENT PROCESS AND PROCESS

03:10:24.780 --> 03:10:26.581
AND AND JUST KIND OF LIVING

03:10:26.648 --> 03:10:29.351
PEOPLE BE REFERRED TO AS WE

03:10:29.417 --> 03:10:30.719
STILL HAVE FIFTEEN HUNDRED IF WE

03:10:30.786 --> 03:10:32.287
AGGRESSIVELY RECRUITED I'M SURE

03:10:32.354 --> 03:10:34.489
THAT WOULD DOUBLE VERY QUICKLY.

03:10:34.556 --> 03:10:38.894
SO -- THEY'RE WEIGHTLESS IF WE

03:10:38.960 --> 03:10:40.195
CAN REDUCE THAT THAT WOULD

03:10:40.262 --> 03:10:41.530
INCREASE THE PROGRAM'S ABILITY

03:10:41.596 --> 03:10:42.464
TO DIVERT.

03:10:42.531 --> 03:10:44.266
AFFORDABLE NURSING HOME MISSION

03:10:44.332 --> 03:10:45.901
AND TO DE INSTITUTIONALIZE OLDER

03:10:45.967 --> 03:10:48.470
ADULTS WHO ARE ABLE TO RETURN TO

03:10:48.537 --> 03:10:50.772

03:25:07.361 --> 03:25:08.663

FEW MONTHS OF MY LIFE.

03:25:21.409 --> 03:25:23.010
IN A NURSING HOME I DON'T THINK

03:25:23.077 --> 03:25:24.412
ANYBODY WANTS THAT IN IN

03:25:24.478 --> 03:25:26.647
