THAT WERE NOT BEING REALISTIC

00:34:47.285 --> 00:34:48.753
IN SOME WAYS ABOUT THE SCOPE.

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:50.087
OF THIS RECESSION AND HOW LONG

00:34:50.154 --> 00:34:52.824

OCCURRING. AND BEING REALISTIC

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:34.451
OKAY WHEN IT COMES TO FEDERAL

00:42:34.518 --> 00:42:36.553
FUNDING THIS IS WHERE THE TWO

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:38.355
PACKAGES REALLY HAVE A

00:42:38.422 --> 00:42:39.223
FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:42.293
APPROACH AND THEY ARE DIFFERENT

00:42:42.359 --> 00:42:43.827
SUCH THAT THEIR THEIR BASELINE

00:42:43.894 --> 00:42:45.930
ASSUMPTIONS ON ON WHETHER OR

00:42:45.996 --> 00:42:48.065
NOT ADDITIONAL FEDERAL AID WILL

00:42:48.132 --> 00:42:49.967
BE FORTHCOMING MAKES IT SO THAT

00:42:50.034 --> 00:42:51.602
IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF DIFFICULT

00:42:51.669 --> 00:42:53.604
TO COMPARE THE TWO PACKAGES.

00:42:53.671 --> 00:42:54.972
ACCORDING TO THEIR BASELINE

00:42:55.039 --> 00:42:56.807
ASSUMPTIONS SO WHAT I MEAN IS

00:42:56.874 --> 00:42:59.576
AS MR TING ALREADY ALLUDED TO

00:42:59.643 --> 00:43:02.713
THE- THE MAY REVISION IS

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:04.882
STARTING FROM A PRESUMPTION

00:43:04.949 --> 00:43:06.350
THAT NO ADDITIONAL FEDERAL

00:43:06.417 --> 00:43:08.118
ASSISTANCE WILL BE FORTHCOMING

00:43:08.185 --> 00:43:11.121
AND THEREFORE. ON JULY FIRST-

00:43:11.188 --> 00:43:14.925
IT INCLUDES AROUND FIFTEEN

00:43:14.992 --> 00:43:16.260
BILLION IN REDUCTIONS. BUT IT

00:43:16.327 --> 00:43:17.995
ALSO INCLUDES- TRIGGER

00:43:18.062 --> 00:43:21.765
PROVISIONS THAT WOULD. REVERSE

00:43:21.832 --> 00:43:23.834
THOSE REDUCTIONS IN THE EVENT

00:43:23.901 --> 00:43:25.970
THAT ADDITIONAL FEDERAL AID

00:43:26.036 --> 00:43:29.606
WERE TO ARRIVE. THE LEGISLATIVE

00:43:29.673 --> 00:43:30.708
BUDGET PACKAGE ON THE OTHER

00:43:30.774 --> 00:43:31.809
HAND STARTS FROM THE

00:43:31.875 --> 00:43:33.510
PRESUMPTION THAT WE WILL

00:43:33.577 --> 00:43:35.646
RECEIVE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL AID-

00:43:35.713 --> 00:43:37.014
HOWEVER IN THAT CASE THE

00:43:37.081 --> 00:43:38.582
CONTINGENCY IS A TRIGGER

00:43:38.649 --> 00:43:40.517
REDUCTION THAT WOULD TAKE PLACE

00:43:40.584 --> 00:43:42.286
ON OCTOBER FIRST IF THE

00:43:42.353 --> 00:43:44.088
ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING DOES

00:43:44.154 --> 00:43:48.392
NOT MATERIALIZE. SO BECAUSE

00:43:48.459 --> 00:43:50.361
THOSE TWO BASELINE ASSUMPTIONS

00:43:50.427 --> 00:43:52.062
ARE KIND OF COMING AT THIS FROM

00:43:52.129 --> 00:43:52.997
A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT

00:43:53.063 --> 00:43:55.032
PLACES OF THE BALANCE OF MY

00:43:55.099 --> 00:43:56.300
REMARKS WILL COMPARE THE TWO

00:43:56.367 --> 00:43:58.635
PACKAGES UNDER THESE DIFFERENT

00:43:58.702 --> 00:44:00.804
SCENARIOS ONE WHERE WE DO HAVE

00:44:00.871 --> 00:44:01.939
THE DIGITAL FEDERAL AID. AND

00:44:02.006 --> 00:44:03.173
THE OTHER WHERE WE DON'T HAVE

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:04.375
ADDITIONAL FEDERAL LAKES I

00:44:04.441 --> 00:44:06.510
THINK THAT IS PROBABLY THE

00:44:06.577 --> 00:44:07.978
CLEAREST WAY TO TALK ABOUT IT.

00:44:08.045 --> 00:44:11.015
SO MOVING TO THE SECOND PAGE OF

00:44:11.081 --> 00:44:13.584
THE OF THE HANDOUT. I'LL START

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:15.119
WITH TOUCHING ON THE CASE IN

00:44:15.185 --> 00:44:16.220
WHICH THERE IS ADDITIONAL

00:44:16.286 --> 00:44:18.922
FEDERAL AID. IN THIS CASE THE

00:44:18.989 --> 00:44:21.191
LEGISLATIVE BUDGET PACKAGE AND

00:44:21.258 --> 00:44:22.926
THE MAY REVISION ARE ACTUALLY

00:44:22.993 --> 00:44:25.062
BROADLY SIMILAR WITH A FEW KEY

00:44:25.129 --> 00:44:27.598
DIFFERENCES. ALL JUST TOUCH ON

00:44:27.664 --> 00:44:30.934
A FEW- THAT ONE ONE NOTABLE

00:44:31.001 --> 00:44:31.869
DIFFERENCES THAT THE

00:44:31.935 --> 00:44:33.070
LEGISLATIVE BUDGET PACKAGE

00:44:33.137 --> 00:44:35.172
WOULD IN THE FISCAL YEAR WITH

00:44:35.239 --> 00:44:37.141
AROUND A BILLION DOLLARS IN

00:44:37.207 --> 00:44:38.909
TOTAL RESERVE HIGHER TOTAL

00:44:38.976 --> 00:44:41.945
RESERVE BALANCES- AT THE END OF

00:44:42.012 --> 00:44:45.049
IT BUDGET YEAR ANOTHER. COUPLE

00:44:45.115 --> 00:44:48.285
OF POINTS OLD NOTE- ONE IS THAT

00:44:48.352 --> 00:44:50.521
THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET PACKAGE

00:44:50.587 --> 00:44:52.256
PROVIDES AROUND A BILLION

00:44:52.322 --> 00:44:54.758
DOLLARS OF FUNDING FOR COUNTIES

00:44:54.825 --> 00:44:57.127
FOR THE REALIGNMENT PROGRAMS-

00:44:57.194 --> 00:45:00.297
REALIGNMENT FUNDING IS EXPECTED

00:45:00.364 --> 00:45:02.299
TO SUFFER SOME SIGNIFICANT.

00:45:02.366 --> 00:45:04.068
DECREASES BECAUSE OF THE COVERT

00:45:04.134 --> 00:45:06.837
NINETEEN RECESSION. AND THE

00:45:06.904 --> 00:45:08.372
LEGISLATIVE BUDGET PACKAGE

00:45:08.439 --> 00:45:11.442
RECOGNIZES THE- DIFFICULTY THAT

00:45:11.508 --> 00:45:13.477
THAT WOULD PUT THE COUNTIES IN

00:45:13.544 --> 00:45:15.045
FROM A FISCAL STANDPOINT AND

00:45:15.112 --> 00:45:16.213
WOULD PROVIDE ABOUT A BILLION

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.315
DOLLARS OF FUNDING TO HELP

00:45:18.382 --> 00:45:19.783
ALLEVIATE THOSE STRESSES

00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:22.519
ALTHOUGH- AROUND SIX HUNDRED

00:45:22.586 --> 00:45:24.221
MILLION OF IT WOULD BE- THE

00:45:24.288 --> 00:45:26.056
SUBJECT TO TRIGGER REDUCTION IN

00:45:26.123 --> 00:45:27.691
THE EVENT WE DON'T RECEIVE

00:45:27.758 --> 00:45:30.127
ADDITIONAL FEDERAL AID. ON

00:45:30.194 --> 00:45:32.029
SIMILARLY THE LEGISLATIVE

00:45:32.096 --> 00:45:33.363
BUDGET PACKAGE DOES PROVIDE

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:34.731
SOME AUGMENTATION TO FUNDING

00:45:34.798 --> 00:45:37.601
FOR THE UNIVERSITY'S. HOUSE CAL

00:45:37.668 --> 00:45:39.136
STATE UNIVERSITY IN THE UC

00:45:39.203 --> 00:45:42.439
SYSTEM'S ALTHOUGH THAT FUNDING

00:45:42.506 --> 00:45:44.007
TO WOULD BE SUBJECT TO

00:45:44.074 --> 00:45:46.376
REDUCTION IF ADDITIONAL-

00:45:46.443 --> 00:45:46.810
FEDERAL MONEY IS NOT

00:45:46.877 --> 00:45:49.746
FORTHCOMING. THERE ARE TWO

00:45:49.813 --> 00:45:51.682
AREAS WHERE YOU KNOW THAT ARE

00:45:51.748 --> 00:45:53.717
DIFFERENT REGARDLESS OF FEDERAL

00:45:53.784 --> 00:45:55.853
FUNDING THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET

00:45:55.919 --> 00:45:57.654
PACKAGE PROVIDES THREE HUNDRED

00:45:57.721 --> 00:45:59.223
AND FIFTY MILLION IN LOCAL

00:45:59.289 --> 00:46:01.825
HOMELESSNESS FUNDING. AND ALSO

00:46:01.892 --> 00:46:03.393
WOULD EXPAND THE EARNED INCOME

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:08.165
TAX CREDIT PROGRAM TO INCLUDE-

00:46:08.232 --> 00:46:10.234
TAXPAYERSTHAT FILE USING

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:12.035
INDIVIDUAL TAX IDENTIFICATION

00:46:12.102 --> 00:46:14.471
NUMBERS I TEN FILERS WITH

00:46:14.538 --> 00:46:17.107
CHILDREN AT THE AGES SIX AND

00:46:17.174 --> 00:46:20.177
UNDER SO- THOSE TWO ITEMS ARE

00:46:20.244 --> 00:46:21.979
SHOWN AT THE LATTER PART OF THE

00:46:22.045 --> 00:46:23.881
TWO BOTTOM POINTS ON THE ON THE

00:46:23.947 --> 00:46:27.084
FIRST SECTION OF THE- THIS PAGE.

00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:30.053
NOW I'LL TURN TO TALKING ABOUT

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:32.422
HOW THE TWO PACKAGES DIFFER IN

00:46:32.489 --> 00:46:34.091
THE EVENT THE STATE DOES NOT

00:46:34.158 --> 00:46:36.026
RECEIVE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL AID

00:46:36.093 --> 00:46:38.128
BECAUSE IN THIS CASE THE

00:46:38.195 --> 00:46:40.230
PACKAGES ARE QUITE DIFFERENT.

00:46:40.297 --> 00:46:41.698
MOVING TO PAGE THREE ALL START

00:46:41.765 --> 00:46:43.534
WITH- DISCUSSION OF BUDGET

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:48.105
RESERVES AND ACTUALLY IF I IF I

00:46:48.172 --> 00:46:50.440
MAY I WOULD- TALKED- BEGIN BY

00:46:50.507 --> 00:46:52.042
SPEAKING TO THE SECOND BULLET

00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:53.977
POINT THERE THE CODED NINETEEN

00:46:54.044 --> 00:46:56.046
CONTINGENCY FUND AS YOU RECALL

00:46:56.113 --> 00:46:57.848
THIS WAS A PROPOSAL IN THE MAY

00:46:57.915 --> 00:46:59.416
REVISION TO ESTABLISH A TWO

00:46:59.483 --> 00:47:01.285
POINT NINE BILLION DOLLAR. A

00:47:01.351 --> 00:47:03.654
CONTINGENCY FUND- THAT WOULD BE

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:07.057
USED TO PAY FOR AS YET UNKNOWN-

00:47:07.124 --> 00:47:09.693
CODE RED NINETEEN RELATED

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.395
RESPONSE ACTIVITIES. THE WAY

00:47:11.461 --> 00:47:13.530
THAT THE FUNDING FOR THIS FOR

00:47:13.597 --> 00:47:15.966
THIS FUND WHICH WOULD BE- COME

00:47:16.033 --> 00:47:17.134
TO BE UNDER THE NAY REVISION

00:47:17.201 --> 00:47:18.769
WAS. FIRST WITH AN

00:47:18.835 --> 00:47:21.305
APPROPRIATION FROM THE GENERAL

00:47:21.371 --> 00:47:23.140
FUND FOR SEVEN HUNDRED AND

00:47:23.207 --> 00:47:24.441
SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WHICH

00:47:24.508 --> 00:47:26.510
WOULD SERVE AS A STATE AS THE

00:47:26.577 --> 00:47:28.812
STATE'S MATCH. TO GENERATE AN

00:47:28.879 --> 00:47:30.681
ADDITIONAL ROUGHLY TWO POINT

00:47:30.747 --> 00:47:32.382
TWO BILLION IN FEDERAL FEMA

00:47:32.449 --> 00:47:34.518
FUNDING. SO THE TOTAL WOULD BE

00:47:34.585 --> 00:47:36.386
TWO POINT NINE BILLION BUT WITH

00:47:36.453 --> 00:47:38.855
THE STATE COST REALLY BEING THE

00:47:38.922 --> 00:47:39.623
SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:41.625
MILLION. SO THE LEGISLATIVE

00:47:41.692 --> 00:47:44.094
BUDGET PERHAPS A PACKAGE.

00:47:44.161 --> 00:47:45.295
REJECT THE CREATION OR

00:47:45.362 --> 00:47:47.297
ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS FUND AND

00:47:47.364 --> 00:47:49.433
RATHER IT TAKES THE SAME STATE

00:47:49.499 --> 00:47:51.335
CONTRIBUTION TO THAT FUND THE

00:47:51.401 --> 00:47:52.169
SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN

00:47:52.236 --> 00:47:54.471
MILLION AND DESIGNATED WITHIN

00:47:54.538 --> 00:47:56.406
THE- SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC

00:47:56.473 --> 00:47:57.808
UNCERTAINTIES. AND IT WOULD

00:47:57.874 --> 00:47:59.643
THEN BE AVAILABLE LATER IN THE

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:01.511
YEAR IN THE EVENT WE NEED. THE

00:48:01.578 --> 00:48:02.980
ADDITIONAL MONEY TO ADDRESS

00:48:03.046 --> 00:48:05.716
CODED NINETEEN RELATED RESPONSE

00:48:05.782 --> 00:48:08.285
ACTIVITIES. THE OTHER ITEM I

00:48:08.352 --> 00:48:12.656
WANTED TO TOUCH ON HERE IS THAT.

00:48:12.723 --> 00:48:14.791
YOU'D SEE THAT THE LEGISLATIVE

00:48:14.858 --> 00:48:17.327
PACKAGE DRAWS DOWN A BIT MORE

00:48:17.394 --> 00:48:18.595
IN THE BUDGET STABILIZATION

00:48:18.662 --> 00:48:19.930
ACCOUNT AND WHAT THAT MAY

00:48:19.997 --> 00:48:22.432
REVISION PROPOSED- JUST AS A

00:48:22.499 --> 00:48:23.867
BRIEF REMINDER I THINK IT CAN

00:48:23.934 --> 00:48:26.103
BE HELPFUL UNDER PROPOSITION

00:48:26.169 --> 00:48:28.272
TWO. HALF OF THE BUDGET

00:48:28.338 --> 00:48:30.040
STABILIZATION ACCOUNT IS

00:48:30.107 --> 00:48:31.642
AVAILABLE IN THE FIRST YEAR OF

00:48:31.708 --> 00:48:33.377
A BUDGET EMERGENCY. AND AS A

00:48:33.443 --> 00:48:36.346
REMINDER THE BUDGET EMERGENCY

00:48:36.413 --> 00:48:40.150
IS THAT CAN BE- ESTABLISHED IN

00:48:40.217 --> 00:48:42.719
TWO WAYS ONE THROUGH A- NATURAL

00:48:42.786 --> 00:48:45.589
DISASTER DECLARATION- AND THEN

00:48:45.656 --> 00:48:48.292
THE OTHER WAY IS TO IF THE

00:48:48.358 --> 00:48:48.825
GOVERNOR DECLARES A FISCAL

00:48:48.892 --> 00:48:50.394
EMERGENCY. IN A FISCAL

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:52.729
EMERGENCY IS DEFINED AS A

00:48:52.796 --> 00:48:54.998
CIRCUMSTANCE IN WHICH-

00:48:55.065 --> 00:48:56.967
RESOURCES IN THE CURRENT YEAR

00:48:57.034 --> 00:48:58.869
AND THE UP COMING YEAR ARE

00:48:58.935 --> 00:49:01.004
EXPECTED TO BE INSUFFICIENT TO

00:49:01.071 --> 00:49:03.540
COVER- THIS IS SPENDING AT THE

00:49:03.607 --> 00:49:05.208
HIGHEST LEVEL OF THE PAST THREE

00:49:05.275 --> 00:49:07.344
BUDGETS ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION

00:49:07.411 --> 00:49:10.180
AND POPULATION. SO TODAY AT IT

00:49:10.247 --> 00:49:12.015
AS WE SPEAK WE HAVE AROUND A

00:49:12.082 --> 00:49:13.083
SIXTEEN POINT TWO BILLION

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:14.785
DOLLAR BUDGET STABILIZATION

00:49:14.851 --> 00:49:16.853
ACCOUNT BALANCE. AND YOU SEE

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:17.921
THAT WE WOULD BE TO BRING IT

00:49:17.988 --> 00:49:19.756
DOWN TO SIX POINT FIVE BILLION

00:49:19.823 --> 00:49:21.358
UNDER THE LEGISLATIVE PLAN.

00:49:21.425 --> 00:49:23.460
WHICH IS CLEARLY MORE THAN HALF

00:49:23.527 --> 00:49:26.063
OF THE SIXTEEN POINT TWO SO-

00:49:26.129 --> 00:49:27.531
YEAH I CAN BRIEFLY ADDRESSED

00:49:27.597 --> 00:49:30.367
THAT AND- OF THE SIXTEEN

00:49:30.434 --> 00:49:32.636
BILLION ABOUT THREE BILLION HAS

00:49:32.703 --> 00:49:34.338
BEEN PUT INTO THE BUDGET

00:49:34.404 --> 00:49:36.673
STABILIZATION ACCOUNT IN RECENT

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:40.110
YEARS ON AN OPTIONAL BASIS. SO

00:49:40.177 --> 00:49:42.179
YOU KNOW THE VIEW IS THAT ALL

00:49:42.245 --> 00:49:43.180
OF THAT THREE BILLION IS

00:49:43.246 --> 00:49:46.116
AVAILABLE WHICH THEN LEADS OF A

00:49:46.183 --> 00:49:47.384
THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET

00:49:47.451 --> 00:49:49.453
STABILIZATION ACCOUNT BALANCE

00:49:49.519 --> 00:49:51.621
SO HALF OF THAT IS SIX SIX AND

00:49:51.688 --> 00:49:52.789
A HALF BILLION OR SO

00:49:52.856 --> 00:49:55.125
APPROXIMATELY AND THEN WHEN YOU

00:49:55.192 --> 00:49:56.893
BRING THAT AND ADD IT TO THE

00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.295
THREE BILLION THAT'S HOW WE

00:49:58.362 --> 00:50:00.530
REDUCE THE BUDGET STABILIZATION

00:50:00.597 --> 00:50:04.568
ACCOUNT BY- ROUND OVER NINE

00:50:04.634 --> 00:50:05.602
BILLION DOWN TO THE SIX POINT

00:50:05.669 --> 00:50:13.043
FIVE. OKAY MOVING TO SLIDE FOR.

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:14.511
BUT THIS IS AN AREA WHERE

00:50:14.578 --> 00:50:16.480
THERE'S SOME OTHER DIFFERENCES

00:50:16.546 --> 00:50:18.281
FROM THE NAY REVISION THIS IS

00:50:18.348 --> 00:50:21.685
IN THE CATEGORY OF CAUTIOUS

00:50:21.752 --> 00:50:25.322
AND- INTER FUND TRANSFERS SO IF

00:50:25.389 --> 00:50:27.357
I MADE DRY YOUR ATTENTION TO

00:50:27.424 --> 00:50:30.093
THE MIDDLE ROW THERE WHERE IT

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:31.962
SAYS REINSTATE DEFERRALS. YOU

00:50:32.028 --> 00:50:34.531
WOULD SEE THAT THE AMOUNT

00:50:34.598 --> 00:50:35.532
LISTED IS ONE POINT EIGHT

00:50:35.599 --> 00:50:37.634
BILLION. UNDER THE LEGISLATIVE

00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:41.004
PLAN. THAT IS THAT REFLECTS TO

00:50:41.071 --> 00:50:42.773
DEFERRALS THAT THE LEGISLATIVE

00:50:42.839 --> 00:50:46.243
PLAN CONTEMPLATES ONE IS THE A

00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:48.211
DEFERRAL OF THE FOURTH QUARTER

00:50:48.278 --> 00:50:49.980
STATE THIS DEFERRAL OF THE

00:50:50.046 --> 00:50:51.548
STATE'S FOURTH QUARTER

00:50:51.615 --> 00:50:54.418
CONTRIBUTION TO CALPERS- FROM

00:50:54.484 --> 00:50:56.453
LATE JUNE EARLY JULY. AND THEN

00:50:56.520 --> 00:51:00.557
IT ALSO INCLUDES A- DEFERRAL OF

00:51:00.624 --> 00:51:03.894
THE JUNE PAYROLL- FROM THE YOU

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:05.562
KNOW BY BASICALLY ONE DAY FROM

00:51:05.629 --> 00:51:07.531
THE AT THE VERY END OF JUNE TO

00:51:07.597 --> 00:51:09.900
THE FIRST DAY OF JULY. NOW

00:51:09.966 --> 00:51:13.170
THERE'S AN IMPORTANT- YOU KNOW-

00:51:13.236 --> 00:51:14.571
ADD ON THAT I NEED TO MAKE TO

00:51:14.638 --> 00:51:15.739
THAT AND THAT IS THAT THE

00:51:15.806 --> 00:51:19.176
LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL INCLUDES.

00:51:19.242 --> 00:51:20.744
WHAT I WOULD CALL A JANUARY

00:51:20.811 --> 00:51:24.548
DETERMINATION PROVISION. SO IF

00:51:24.614 --> 00:51:27.184
IT IF WE GET TO JANUARY AND IT

00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:28.685
APPEARS THAT THE STATE'S FISCAL

00:51:28.752 --> 00:51:31.888
CONDITION IS BETTER IN BETTER

00:51:31.955 --> 00:51:33.690
CONDITION THAN WHAT IT IS AT

00:51:33.757 --> 00:51:35.625
THE TIME OF BUDGET ENACTMENT.

00:51:35.692 --> 00:51:36.760
SO THAT WOULD BE MEASURED BY

00:51:36.827 --> 00:51:38.261
HIGHER REVENUES SOME

00:51:38.328 --> 00:51:39.763
COMBINATION OF HIGHER REVENUES

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:41.264
IN LOWER EXPENDITURES THAN WE

00:51:41.331 --> 00:51:42.766
THOUGHT WHEN THE BUDGET IS

00:51:42.833 --> 00:51:44.468
ENACTED AT THAT YOU KNOW IN

00:51:44.534 --> 00:51:47.704
JUNE. AND IF THAT'S THE CASE

00:51:47.771 --> 00:51:49.139
THEN THIS PAYROLL THE PEARL

00:51:49.206 --> 00:51:50.740
WOULD NOT GO FORWARD IT WOULD

00:51:50.807 --> 00:51:54.177
BE ELIMINATED BUT- STARTING

00:51:54.244 --> 00:51:55.245
FROM JUST THE BASELINE

00:51:55.312 --> 00:51:56.813
ASSUMPTIONS WE'RE SHOWING IT IN

00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:00.116
THIS LIFE. AND ANOTHER KEY

00:52:00.183 --> 00:52:01.918
POINT ABOUT THESE DEFERRALS IS

00:52:01.985 --> 00:52:03.386
THAT THEY WOULD APPLY TO BOTH

00:52:03.453 --> 00:52:05.088
THE GENERAL FUND AND TO THE

00:52:05.155 --> 00:52:09.125
STATE'S SPECIAL FUNDS. SO THEN

00:52:09.192 --> 00:52:11.061
THIS SPECIAL FUNDS THE SAVINGS

00:52:11.127 --> 00:52:12.429
THAT WOULD BE REALIZED BY THE

00:52:12.496 --> 00:52:15.065
SPECIAL FUNDS BY BY-

00:52:15.131 --> 00:52:16.900
IMPLEMENTING THESE DEFERRALS

00:52:16.967 --> 00:52:18.235
WOULD BE SHIFTED TO THE GENERAL

00:52:18.301 --> 00:52:20.237
FUND IN THE FORM OF A LOAN TO

00:52:20.303 --> 00:52:21.972
THE GENERAL FUND AND SO

00:52:22.038 --> 00:52:24.007
ACTUALLY IF THE THIS RELATES TO

00:52:24.074 --> 00:52:26.176
THE LINE OR THE ROW JUST ABOVE

00:52:26.243 --> 00:52:27.577
REINSTATEMENT DEFERRALS THE

00:52:27.644 --> 00:52:30.080
FIRST ROW SPECIAL FIND LOANS

00:52:30.146 --> 00:52:31.681
AND TRANSFERS YOU'LL NOTE THAT

00:52:31.748 --> 00:52:33.917
THE- LEGISLATURE. IS IT IS

00:52:33.984 --> 00:52:35.318
ABOUT ONE POINT ONE BILLION

00:52:35.385 --> 00:52:37.120
HIGHER THAN THE NAY REVISION IN

00:52:37.187 --> 00:52:39.623
THIS AREA. AND THAT ONE POINT

00:52:39.689 --> 00:52:41.525
ONE BILLION. IS REALLY THE

00:52:41.591 --> 00:52:43.193
REFLECTION OF THAT THAT

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:45.395
ACCOUNTS FOR THE SAVINGS THAT I

00:52:45.462 --> 00:52:47.163
JUST DESCRIBED- THAT THEIR

00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:49.199
SPECIAL FUNDS WOULD REALIZE

00:52:49.266 --> 00:52:51.401
FROM THESE- DEFERRALS. SO

00:52:51.468 --> 00:52:53.370
THAT'S HOW THE TWO TWO ROWS

00:52:53.436 --> 00:52:57.641
RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER. OKAY

00:52:57.707 --> 00:53:02.045
MOVING TO. THAT SLIDE FIVE.

00:53:02.112 --> 00:53:04.247
HERE I WOULD SPEAK ABOUTTHE

00:53:04.314 --> 00:53:05.715
FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS AND

00:53:05.782 --> 00:53:08.552
COMMUNITY COLLEGE FUNDING UNDER

00:53:08.618 --> 00:53:11.288
THE LEGISLATIVE PLAN THERE IN

00:53:11.354 --> 00:53:13.089
THIS IS A CASE WHERE THERE'S NO

00:53:13.156 --> 00:53:15.792
ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING- TO

00:53:15.859 --> 00:53:19.262
ADDRESS THE CODED RECESSION. IN

00:53:19.329 --> 00:53:20.664
THIS CASE IN THE LEGISLATIVE

00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:22.499
BUDGET PLAN FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS

00:53:22.566 --> 00:53:24.501
AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES DIFFERS

00:53:24.568 --> 00:53:25.769
FROM THE NAY REVISION IN THAT

00:53:25.835 --> 00:53:27.871
THERE IS NO REDUCTION AND TO

00:53:27.938 --> 00:53:29.439
THE OVERALL LEVEL OF FUN

00:53:29.506 --> 00:53:31.041
FUNDING THAT GOES TO THE

00:53:31.107 --> 00:53:32.275
SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES

00:53:32.342 --> 00:53:34.144
IN FACT THERE'S AN INCREASE AND

00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:36.913
COMPARED WITH THE MAY REVISION-

00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:38.915
FUNDING FOR THE FOR THE SCHOOLS

00:53:38.982 --> 00:53:40.350
AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES WOULD BE

00:53:40.417 --> 00:53:42.586
HIGHER THAN THE NAY REVISION BY

00:53:42.652 --> 00:53:45.956
ABOUT. EIGHT BILLION. THE

00:53:46.022 --> 00:53:48.959
SOURCE OF HIGHER FUNDING IN THE

00:53:49.025 --> 00:53:51.361
LEGISLATIVE PLAN IS FROM FROM

00:53:51.428 --> 00:53:55.165
TWO PLACES ONE IS THE-

00:53:55.231 --> 00:53:56.633
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:58.602
FUNDING LEVEL OF PROVIDED BY

00:53:58.668 --> 00:54:00.470
THE GENERAL FUND WOULD BE ABOVE

00:54:00.537 --> 00:54:02.038
THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE AND IT

00:54:02.105 --> 00:54:05.742
WOULD BE- FOR ABOUT TWO POINT

00:54:05.809 --> 00:54:06.309
SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS ABOUT

00:54:06.376 --> 00:54:11.047
THAT LEVEL. THEN IN ADDITION.

00:54:11.114 --> 00:54:14.250
THERE WOULD BE THE USE OF THE

00:54:14.317 --> 00:54:15.852
LEGISLATIVE PLAN WOULD CONVERT

00:54:15.919 --> 00:54:17.687
ABOUT FIVE POINT THREE BILLION

00:54:17.754 --> 00:54:19.956
OF FUNDING TO DEFERRALS AND AT

00:54:20.023 --> 00:54:22.092
THE SAME TIME PRESERVE- IN

00:54:22.158 --> 00:54:23.360
DOING SO PRESERVE THE

00:54:23.426 --> 00:54:24.861
PROGRAMMATIC LEVEL OF FUNDING

00:54:24.928 --> 00:54:27.130
FOR THE SCHOOLS BUT WITH THAT

00:54:27.197 --> 00:54:28.698
RELATIVE TO THE MAY REVISION AN

00:54:28.765 --> 00:54:30.100
ADDITIONAL FIVE POINT THREE

00:54:30.166 --> 00:54:31.668
BILLION OF THAT BEING PROVIDED

00:54:31.735 --> 00:54:34.938
IN- DEFERRAL IN DEFERRED FUNDS.

00:54:35.005 --> 00:54:37.107
SO THE FIVE POINT THREE BILLION

00:54:37.173 --> 00:54:38.375
PLUS THE TWO POINT SEVEN

00:54:38.441 --> 00:54:40.310
BILLION IS HOW YOU GET TO THE

00:54:40.377 --> 00:54:42.579
EIGHT BILLION. IN HIGHER

00:54:42.646 --> 00:54:44.414
FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS UNDER THE

00:54:44.481 --> 00:54:46.149
LEGISLATIVE PLAN RELATIVE TO

00:54:46.216 --> 00:54:50.954
THE NAY REVISION. OKAY MOVING

00:54:51.021 --> 00:54:53.323
FINALLY HERE TO THE LAST PAGE

00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:56.359
ON SLIDE SIX. THIS SLIDE

00:54:56.426 --> 00:54:58.461
DISPLAYS SOME OF THE MAJOR

00:54:58.528 --> 00:55:00.563
PROGRAMMATIC DIFFERENCES

00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:02.265
BETWEEN THEM A REVISION AND THE

00:55:02.332 --> 00:55:04.167
LEGISLATIVE PLAN AND IF YOU

00:55:04.234 --> 00:55:06.036
THINK ABOUT THE SCENARIO WHERE

00:55:06.102 --> 00:55:07.137
THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL FEDERAL

00:55:07.203 --> 00:55:09.773
FUNDING THAT BECOMES AVAILABLE.

00:55:09.839 --> 00:55:11.641
I WOULD SAY THAT THIS SLIDE

00:55:11.708 --> 00:55:13.276
REALLY IS AT THE HEART OF HOW

00:55:13.343 --> 00:55:15.545
THE TWO PACKAGES DIFFER FROM

00:55:15.612 --> 00:55:17.814
ONE ANOTHER. YOU WOULD NOTE-

00:55:17.881 --> 00:55:21.518
AS- DOCTOR RANDY LISTED. THE TO

00:55:21.584 --> 00:55:22.886
THE LEGISLATIVE PLAN HERE

00:55:22.952 --> 00:55:24.621
REJECTS THE GOVERNOR'S

00:55:24.688 --> 00:55:26.890
PROPOSED. REPURPOSE SCENE OF

00:55:26.956 --> 00:55:28.992
THE PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDS

00:55:29.059 --> 00:55:31.528
TO. WHICH IN THE MAY REVISION

00:55:31.594 --> 00:55:33.563
IT WITH THOSE THE FUNDING THERE

00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:35.031
WOULD BE USED TO PAY FOR GROWTH

00:55:35.098 --> 00:55:37.000
IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM THE

00:55:37.067 --> 00:55:38.635
LEGISLATIVE PLAN- REJECTS

00:55:38.702 --> 00:55:40.036
DOUBTING WOULD CONTINUE TO USE

00:55:40.103 --> 00:55:46.042
THE FUNDS. FOR SIMILARLY THE

00:55:46.109 --> 00:55:47.877
LEGISLATIVE PLAN REJCTS THE

00:55:47.944 --> 00:55:50.747
PROPOSAL TO REDUCE THE AYE HSS

00:55:50.814 --> 00:55:54.417
SERVICE HOURS. AND YOU KNOW SO

00:55:54.484 --> 00:55:55.785
THE OTHER ITEMS YOU CAN SEE

00:55:55.852 --> 00:55:57.921
HERE LISTED ON THE SLIDE IN

00:55:57.987 --> 00:56:01.091
THESE THESE ARE- SOME OF WHAT

00:56:01.157 --> 00:56:02.792
YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. AS

00:56:02.859 --> 00:56:04.828
KEY PROGRAMMATIC DIFFERENCES

00:56:04.894 --> 00:56:07.464
BETWEEN THE TWO PACKAGES. BUT I

00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:09.265
WOULD JUST POINT OUT TO INCLUDE

00:56:09.332 --> 00:56:12.235
MY PREPARED REMARKS THAT YOU

00:56:12.302 --> 00:56:13.536
KNOW THE WAY THAT THE

00:56:13.603 --> 00:56:15.505
LEGISLATIVE BUDGET PACKAGE IS

00:56:15.572 --> 00:56:17.173
ABLE TO PROVIDE THESE OR

00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:18.942
MAINTAIN THE FUNDING LEVEL FOR

00:56:19.008 --> 00:56:21.277
THE SERVICES IS REALLY.

00:56:21.344 --> 00:56:23.613
SUMMARIZED IN THREE POINTS-

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:25.515
FIRST THE USE OF THE LA-

00:56:25.582 --> 00:56:27.117
CASELOADS AS I WAS SAYING

00:56:27.183 --> 00:56:29.385
EARLIER SECOND THE L. THE

00:56:29.452 --> 00:56:31.755
LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE USES A BIT

00:56:31.821 --> 00:56:33.723
MORE OF THE STATE'S RESERVES-

00:56:33.790 --> 00:56:35.492
THAN THE NAY REVISION WOULD.

00:56:35.558 --> 00:56:38.595
AND THEN THIRD- THEN THE

00:56:38.661 --> 00:56:40.597
LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE DOES USE. A

00:56:40.663 --> 00:56:44.134
BIT MORE CAUTIOUS- AS I JUST

00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:45.502
TALKED ABOUT UNDER THAT EARLIER

00:56:45.568 --> 00:56:48.271
SLIDE SO THOSE THREE ACTIONS

00:56:48.338 --> 00:56:49.572
ARE REALLY WHAT PROVIDE THE

00:56:49.639 --> 00:56:51.608
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AT LEAST

00:56:51.674 --> 00:56:54.310
ON AT. A ONE TIME BASIS IN A

00:56:54.377 --> 00:56:56.079
COUPLE OF THOSE CASES- THE

00:56:56.146 --> 00:56:57.947
ENABLE THAT THE PACKAGE TO

00:56:58.014 --> 00:56:59.849
SUSTAIN THESE PROGRAMS AS

00:56:59.916 --> 00:57:03.253
DESCRIBED ON THE SIX A SLIGHT.

00:57:03.319 --> 00:57:04.721
SO WITH THAT THAT'S A SUMMARY

00:57:04.788 --> 00:57:07.056
OF. HOW WE VIEW THE TWO

00:57:07.123 --> 00:57:08.925
PACKAGES AND HOW THE- OR

00:57:08.992 --> 00:57:10.360
SIMILAR AND HOW THEY ARE

00:57:10.426 --> 00:57:12.762
DIFFERENT HOW THEY DIFFER. WITH

00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:14.364
THAT I WILL BE HAPPY TO.

00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:16.666
RESPOND TO QUESTIONS WHEN THE

00:57:16.733 --> 00:57:18.802
TIME IS APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU

00:57:18.868 --> 00:57:19.736
WITHOUT WILL GO TO DEPARTMENT

00:57:19.803 --> 00:57:20.603
OF FINANCE MISTER THIS WHEN

00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:23.206
THEY- DO YOU MISTER CHANG

00:57:23.273 --> 00:57:24.641
MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE

00:57:24.707 --> 00:57:26.109

BRIEF AT AND JUST MAKE THREE

00:57:28.077 --> 00:57:30.346
POINTS- ABOUT- A REVISION AND

00:57:30.413 --> 00:57:31.815
THE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL. THE

00:57:31.881 --> 00:57:33.783
FIRST IS I WANT TO NOTE LIKE MR

00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:35.418
PADDACK- NUMBEROF ITEMS THAT

00:57:35.485 --> 00:57:36.686
ARE IN COMMON BETWEEN THE NAY

00:57:36.753 --> 00:57:38.388
REVISIONS AND THE LEGISLATIVE

00:57:38.454 --> 00:57:41.391
BUDGET PROPOSAL IN PARTICULAR-

00:57:41.457 --> 00:57:42.559
GRATEFUL FOR A. B. CONTINUED

00:57:42.625 --> 00:57:44.661
PLUSH. AMONG MEMBERS FOR A

00:57:44.727 --> 00:57:46.162
GREATER FEDERAL FUNDS IN ACTION

AND CONGRESS. WE APPRECIATE THE

00:57:48.231 --> 00:57:50.166
FACT THAT THE REVENUES-

00:57:50.233 --> 00:57:52.101
ESTIMATES FOR EACH OF THESE

00:57:52.168 --> 00:57:54.304
PACKAGES ARE THE SAME- AND AT

00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:55.438
THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET PROPOSAL

00:57:55.505 --> 00:57:56.506
ALSO INCLUDES THE TEMPORARY NEW

00:57:56.573 --> 00:57:58.174
REVENUES. THAT WERE IN THE NAY

00:57:58.241 --> 00:58:00.443
REVISION. AND WHILE AS MR

00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:02.445
PADDOCK NOTED WE HAVE AYE

00:58:02.512 --> 00:58:03.980
DIFFERENCES ON CASE WHAT

00:58:04.047 --> 00:58:05.782
ASSUMPTIONS AND- ON A KIND OF

00:58:05.849 --> 00:58:07.450
SEVERAL BILLION DOLLARS WE KNOW

00:58:07.517 --> 00:58:08.518
THAT SOMETHING THAT WILL BE

00:58:08.585 --> 00:58:11.287
CONTINUING TO DISCUSS- IN THE

00:58:11.354 --> 00:58:12.522
DAYS AHEAD. THIS POINT I WANT

00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:14.390
TO MAKE THOUGH ABOUT

00:58:14.457 --> 00:58:15.625
LEGISLATURE PROPOSAL THAT THE

00:58:15.692 --> 00:58:16.860
ADMINISTRATION DOES REMAIN

00:58:16.926 --> 00:58:18.928
CONCERNED. ABOUT STRUCTURAL

00:58:18.995 --> 00:58:20.463
DEFICITS PARTICULARLY IN THE

00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:22.699
OUT YEARS AND WE UNDERSTAND

00:58:22.765 --> 00:58:24.167
THAT IN THE MAIL REVISION. EVEN

00:58:24.234 --> 00:58:25.969
THE BUDGET THAT WE PUT FORWARD

00:58:26.035 --> 00:58:27.403
HAD SOME STRUCTURAL ISSUES THAT

00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:29.005
NEED TO BE ADDRESSED- IN THE

00:58:29.072 --> 00:58:30.406
YEARS AFTER THE BUDGET YEAR.

00:58:30.473 --> 00:58:32.175
AND THAT IS WHAT OUR BEST

00:58:32.242 --> 00:58:34.110
ESTIMATE OF THE REVENUES. NOW

00:58:34.177 --> 00:58:35.912
AS EVERYONE KNOWS WE ARE IN A

00:58:35.979 --> 00:58:37.914
VERY UNCERTAIN SITUATION. IT'S

00:58:37.981 --> 00:58:39.115
POSSIBLE THAT CONGRESS WILL

00:58:39.182 --> 00:58:40.617
COME THROUGH WITH EVEN MORE AID

00:58:40.683 --> 00:58:42.452
THAN WE ARE EXPECTING. IT'S

00:58:42.518 --> 00:58:43.653
POSSIBLE THAT THE ECONOMY CAN

00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:46.789
RECOVER MORE ROBUSTLY- DAN OUR-

00:58:46.856 --> 00:58:48.258
ECONOMIC EXPERTS ARE.

00:58:48.324 --> 00:58:49.859
PROJECTING BUT IT'S ALSO

00:58:49.926 --> 00:58:51.127
POSSIBLE THAT ALL THESE NUMBERS

00:58:51.194 --> 00:58:52.328
COULD BE EVEN WORSE THAN WE ARE

00:58:52.395 --> 00:58:54.264
PROJECTING RIGHT NOW SO WE WANT

00:58:54.330 --> 00:58:55.565
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO PREPARE

00:58:55.632 --> 00:58:57.066
FOR THAT POSSIBILITY. AND WE

00:58:57.133 --> 00:58:58.735
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT A BUDGET

00:58:58.801 --> 00:58:59.736
THAT ADDS SEVERAL BILLION

00:58:59.802 --> 00:59:01.938
DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL DEFICITS.

00:59:02.005 --> 00:59:03.473
IN THOSE OUT YEARS. AND THAT

00:59:03.539 --> 00:59:04.741
BRINGS ME TO MY LAST POINT

00:59:04.807 --> 00:59:06.442
WHICH IS THE CONTENT OF THE

00:59:06.509 --> 00:59:07.944
TRIGGER POTS- THAT MR PADDOCK

00:59:08.011 --> 00:59:09.579
MENTIONED. WELL WE ARE ALL

00:59:09.646 --> 00:59:11.648
HOPEFUL THAT CONGRESS WILL GET

00:59:11.714 --> 00:59:12.982
ITS ACT TOGETHER AND PASS A

00:59:13.049 --> 00:59:14.851
PACKAGE THAT PROVIDES. MUCH

00:59:14.918 --> 00:59:16.185
GREATER STATE AND LOCAL AID WE

00:59:16.252 --> 00:59:17.220
ALSO KNOW THAT THERE'S A

00:59:17.287 --> 00:59:19.322
POSSIBILITY THAT THEY WILL NOT

00:59:19.389 --> 00:59:20.623
COME THROUGH IN WASHINGTON DC.

00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:21.624
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

00:59:21.691 --> 00:59:24.160
CONTENT OF THE TRIGGER CUTS ARE

00:59:24.227 --> 00:59:25.828
ONE TIME IN NATURE WHETHER THEY

00:59:25.895 --> 00:59:27.697
ARE CAUTIOUS OR DIGITAL USES OF

00:59:27.764 --> 00:59:29.933
RESERVES. THOSE ARE AREAS THAT

00:59:29.999 --> 00:59:31.334
WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE IN THE

00:59:31.401 --> 00:59:33.369
YEAR AFTER THE BUDGET YEAR.

00:59:33.436 --> 00:59:34.437
WHICH COULD FORCES TO RESERVE

00:59:34.504 --> 00:59:37.040
ON. CHOICES ON WHAT WE'RE

00:59:37.106 --> 00:59:41.911
ALREADY SEEING ON THE

00:59:41.978 --> 00:59:42.512
LEGISLATURE AND ON THE GO. SO

00:59:42.578 --> 00:59:43.079
THE ARE SOME CONCERNS BUT I

00:59:43.146 --> 00:59:43.813
WANT TO REITERATE. WE THE

00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:45.248
POINTS AND CON. WE KNOW THAT WE

00:59:45.315 --> 00:59:46.282

IN CALIFORNIA CROSS A NATION.

01:08:08.284 --> 01:08:09.919

THAT WHEN WE NEGOTIATED- CAP

01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:09.291
AND TRADE AND TO FOLLOW UP ON

01:12:09.358 --> 01:12:10.526
WHAT MISTER COOPER TALKED ABOUT

01:12:10.592 --> 01:12:11.660
THE OBJECTIVE OF THE CAPITATE

01:12:11.727 --> 01:12:13.729
PROGRAM WAS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS

01:12:13.796 --> 01:12:15.364
IT WASN'T A REVENUE GENERATING

01:12:15.431 --> 01:12:16.799
PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED TO JUST

01:12:16.865 --> 01:12:18.233
GENERATE REVENUE CONTINUOUS

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:20.736
THESE CORRECT GENERALLY IT THE

01:12:20.803 --> 01:12:22.438
REASON THAT WE DISCUSS REVENUES

01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:23.639
SIMPLY BECAUSE WE'RE PUTTING

01:12:23.706 --> 01:12:25.841
FORWARD THAT BUDGET PLAN- BUT

01:12:25.908 --> 01:12:26.842
CERTAINLY THE IDEA BEHIND

01:12:26.909 --> 01:12:28.444
CAPTAIN TRADERS TO STEP AWAY

01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:31.213
REDUCE THE NOT BE- EMISSIONS OF

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:32.381
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OKAY SO

01:12:32.448 --> 01:12:33.115
THEN IT IS. THERE'S AN

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:37.720
UNDERSTANDING. THAT THAT. IF

01:12:37.786 --> 01:12:39.254
INTRIGUED BECOME IS EFFECTIVE

01:12:39.321 --> 01:12:41.190
AND- WOULD. THAT THAT THE

01:12:41.256 --> 01:12:41.790
MATTER REVENUE WILL PROBABLY

01:12:41.857 --> 01:12:43.692
TAKE OVER TIME. CORRECT

01:12:43.759 --> 01:12:45.360
CERTAINLY OVER OR TIME ALTHOUGH

01:12:45.427 --> 01:12:47.563
THE CAP ALSO DECLINES OVER TIME

01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:49.198
SO THEIR NUMBER OF SHIFTING

01:12:49.264 --> 01:12:50.899
DYNAMICS- IN THE IN THE CAP AND

01:12:50.966 --> 01:12:53.435
TRADE MARKET. RIGHT SO. I GUESS

01:12:53.502 --> 01:12:54.636
I'M I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

01:12:54.703 --> 01:12:56.805
AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS RULE

01:12:56.872 --> 01:12:59.875
MAKING- IS THAT WHY SHOULD.

01:12:59.942 --> 01:13:02.377
THIS BE DONE IN THEBUDGET WE

01:13:02.444 --> 01:13:03.912
SHOULD WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER.

01:13:03.979 --> 01:13:05.681
DONE THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE

01:13:05.748 --> 01:13:08.817
PROCESS. ESPECIALLY IF. BY BY

01:13:08.884 --> 01:13:10.619
REDESIGNING CAP AND TRADE AND-

01:13:10.686 --> 01:13:12.254
AND IF THE IF THE IF THE GOAL

01:13:12.321 --> 01:13:15.457
IS. EMISSIONS AND NOT REVENUES

01:13:15.524 --> 01:13:16.358
THEN THAT WILL LEAD TO A

01:13:16.425 --> 01:13:18.861
DIFFERENT- I GUESS A DIFFERENT.

01:13:18.927 --> 01:13:21.263
DID WE DECIDE BUT YOU CAN'T

01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:23.031
INCREASE REVENUES IN CAP AND

01:13:23.098 --> 01:13:24.466
TRADE WITOUT. DIRECTLY

01:13:24.533 --> 01:13:27.436
INCREASING THE COSTS. TO

01:13:27.503 --> 01:13:29.138
CALIFORNIANS WHEN WRITTEN AT

01:13:29.204 --> 01:13:30.506
LEAST WITH INTERVIEW AND IN

01:13:30.572 --> 01:13:32.574
RELATIONSHIP TO- GAS PRICES

01:13:32.641 --> 01:13:34.209
UTILITY BILLS TO YOU KNOW

01:13:34.276 --> 01:13:35.944
WHATEVER COSTS. INTO THE

01:13:36.011 --> 01:13:37.780
GENERATING ENERGY- SO I'M JUST

01:13:37.846 --> 01:13:40.249
SO I UNDERSTAND. THE REDESIGN

01:13:40.315 --> 01:13:42.251
WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER DONE- THE

01:13:42.317 --> 01:13:45.487
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND NOT TO

01:13:45.554 --> 01:13:46.321
THE BUDGET. SO I CAN'T SPEAK

01:13:46.388 --> 01:13:47.790
WITH TO THAT BECAUSE IT'S SO.

01:13:47.856 --> 01:13:49.558
PROPOSAL IN AND WAS NOT OF THAT

01:13:49.625 --> 01:13:51.026
NEIGHBOR THAT THE GOVERNOR

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:53.195
PROPOSED LAST MONTH- I THINK

01:13:53.262 --> 01:13:54.730
GENERALLY FOR THE BUDGET YOU

01:13:54.797 --> 01:13:56.632
KNOW WE ARE FOCUSED ON- THE

01:13:56.698 --> 01:13:57.699
POSSIBILITY THAT THERE WILL BE

01:13:57.766 --> 01:13:59.535
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED REVENUES.

01:13:59.601 --> 01:14:00.803
NEXT YEAR WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE

01:14:00.869 --> 01:14:02.571
OUR PAY AS YOU GO MACINNES THEM

01:14:02.638 --> 01:14:04.606
I WILL SAY THAT- WHILE THAT

01:14:04.673 --> 01:14:06.208
PRIMARY PURPOSE A CAP AND TRADE

01:14:06.275 --> 01:14:06.942
IS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS

01:14:07.009 --> 01:14:08.277
OVERTIME. AT THE REVENUE

01:14:08.343 --> 01:14:10.045
GENERATED BY THOSE PROGRAMS-

01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:11.980
DOES FIND SOME PRETTY IMPORTANT

01:14:12.047 --> 01:14:12.948
INITIATIVES FROM THE

01:14:13.015 --> 01:14:14.349
ADMINISTRATION'S PERSPECTIVE

01:14:14.416 --> 01:14:16.318
AND WE SAW IN OUR PROPOSAL TO

01:14:16.385 --> 01:14:17.953
HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THOSE THAT WE

01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:18.420
BELIEVE ARE ESPECIALLY

01:14:18.487 --> 01:14:20.322
IMPORTANT SUCH AS COMMITTEE-

01:14:20.389 --> 01:14:22.825
PROTECTION- FORCED A WILDFIRE

01:14:22.891 --> 01:14:24.092
SAFETY. AND SAID IN A PORTABLE

01:14:24.159 --> 01:14:25.260
DRINKING WATER SO WE ARE

01:14:25.327 --> 01:14:27.129
COGNIZANT OF THE FACT THAT-

01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:28.797
WHILE THE REVENUE CAN VARY OVER

01:14:28.864 --> 01:14:30.065
TIME THEIR NUMBER OP IMPORTANT

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:32.768
PROGRAMS- THAT YOU RELY ON THAT

01:14:32.835 --> 01:14:34.236
FUNDING BUT I'D BEYOND THAT I

01:14:34.303 --> 01:14:35.103
DON'T WANT TO APPLY

01:14:35.170 --> 01:14:35.537
SPECIFICALLY ON THE

01:14:35.604 --> 01:14:37.306
LEGISLATIVE. SINCE IT WAS NOT

01:14:37.372 --> 01:14:38.340
IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD DO YOU KNOW

01:14:38.407 --> 01:14:39.708
IF THE THAT THE LANGUAGE OF THE

01:14:39.775 --> 01:14:41.810
PROPOSAL IS PERMISSIVE SO IF IT

01:14:41.877 --> 01:14:44.046
HAPPENS TO BE THAT HERE BE.

01:14:44.112 --> 01:14:45.881
ANALYZES THE CHANGES FINDS OF

01:14:45.948 --> 01:14:48.250
TO BE DETRIMENTAL TO RATEPAYERS

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:50.185
ARE TO CALIFORNIA'S ARE TO COME

01:14:50.252 --> 01:14:51.486
TO ENTITIES ARE INVOLVED IN THE

01:14:51.553 --> 01:14:52.921
PROGRAM THAT WOULD IF THEY

01:14:52.988 --> 01:14:54.857
CHOSE TO CLOSE THE RULE MAKING

01:14:54.923 --> 01:14:56.158
WITH ACTION IS THAT POSSIBLE.

01:14:56.225 --> 01:15:00.429
I'D HAVE. TO DOUBLE CHECK ON

01:15:00.495 --> 01:15:02.698
THAT QUESTION. OKAY AT MID MAY

01:15:02.764 --> 01:15:05.234
THIS IS A THAT I AM IF WANTED

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:07.636
TO. AT THE TIME AND IS. IT DO

01:15:07.703 --> 01:15:08.537
THEY HAVE PURSUE. ON PROPOSED.

01:15:08.604 --> 01:15:10.672
IS THIS AN ERROR THAT. SHOULD

01:15:10.739 --> 01:15:11.406
GO THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE

01:15:11.473 --> 01:15:13.242
PROCESS AND NOT THROUGH THE

01:15:13.308 --> 01:15:20.382
BUDGET. AND OVERLOOKED. OH

01:15:20.449 --> 01:15:23.418
SORRY. IF YOU START COME UP TO

01:15:23.485 --> 01:15:25.287
JUST LOOK TALKING YEAH I KNOW I

01:15:25.354 --> 01:15:26.955
THINK I WOULD ALSO NEED TO

01:15:27.022 --> 01:15:28.056
CHECK WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON

01:15:28.123 --> 01:15:33.996
THAT PARTICULAR QUESTION. I

01:15:34.062 --> 01:15:35.230
MEAN I THINK WHETHER OR NOT YOU

01:15:35.297 --> 01:15:37.466
WOULD WANT TO DO IT THROUGH THE

01:15:37.532 --> 01:15:39.234
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IS REALLY A

01:15:39.301 --> 01:15:41.336
DECISION FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:15:41.403 --> 01:15:43.272
MAKE I MEAN IT- PROVOCATIVE

01:15:43.338 --> 01:15:44.172
WHETHER YOU WANT TO DO IT

01:15:44.239 --> 01:15:45.374
THROUGH THE LEGEND THE- THE

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:47.409
POLICY PROCESS OR THROUGH THE

01:15:47.476 --> 01:15:49.311
BUDGET PROCESS. IS THE MEAN IS

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:50.879
IT IS IT MY INTERPRETATION

01:15:50.946 --> 01:15:54.049
CORRECT THAT THAT A LOOK IF

01:15:54.116 --> 01:15:56.985
THE BUDGET- LANGUAGE. WHO

01:15:57.052 --> 01:15:59.054
DIRECTS THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD

01:15:59.121 --> 01:16:00.589
TO CONDUCT RULE MAKING THAT

01:16:00.656 --> 01:16:02.891
WERE RELINQUISHING OUR ABILITY

01:16:02.958 --> 01:16:05.394
TO. BASICALLY REVIEW AND

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:07.229
REDESIGNED CAP AND TRADE I WAS

01:16:07.296 --> 01:16:08.764
PUT THE LEGISLATURE NEGOTIATED

01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:10.432
YEARS AGO AND WE'RE GIVING THAT

01:16:10.499 --> 01:16:13.235
POWER TO AN AGENCY WOULDN'T IS

01:16:13.302 --> 01:16:14.169
A MY INTERPRETATION CORRECT

01:16:14.236 --> 01:16:16.004
INCORRECT AND IN THAT AND IN

01:16:16.071 --> 01:16:18.774
THIS MANNER. WELL I'M NOT TO MY

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.442
KNOWLEDGE THAT WILL THEM TO MY

01:16:20.509 --> 01:16:21.376
KNOWLEDGE THAT THAT THAT

01:16:21.443 --> 01:16:23.211
LANGUAGES AND NOT FINALIZED AT

01:16:23.278 --> 01:16:26.915
THIS POINT SO I'D BE RELUCTANT

01:16:26.982 --> 01:16:28.817
TO. SAY ONE WAY OR THE OTHER

01:16:28.884 --> 01:16:32.120
BUT THERE'S ACT MY GUESS IS

01:16:32.187 --> 01:16:32.988
THAT THAT CONCERNED THOUGH.

01:16:33.055 --> 01:16:34.589
POSSIBLE ATTENTION EIGHT

01:16:34.656 --> 01:16:36.792
PASSING OKAY NINE I THINK THAT

01:16:36.858 --> 01:16:38.860
AND THAT I THINK THAT'S MY OF

01:16:38.927 --> 01:16:41.229
MY PERSPECTIVE IS MY CONCERN

TO NOW SOMEHOW. HAVE AN AGENCY

01:16:56.812 --> 01:16:59.748
BE ASKED TO CONDUCT RULE MAKING

01:16:59.815 --> 01:17:01.016
AT A TIME WHEN THAT PROBABLY

01:17:01.083 --> 01:17:02.217
SHOULD BE WITHIN THE PURVIEW

01:17:02.284 --> 01:17:03.452
THE LEGISLATURE I THINK THAT'S

01:17:03.518 --> 01:17:06.288
SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO BE

01:17:06.355 --> 01:17:06.922
CONCERNED ABOUT. THANK YOU VERY

01:17:06.989 --> 01:17:10.425
MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER MOORE.

UNLESS LIKE TO PIGGY BACK ON

01:17:14.029 --> 01:17:14.930
MISTER COOPER MISTER FARMS

01:17:14.997 --> 01:17:16.365
QUESTIONS ABOUT CAP AND TRADE

01:17:16.431 --> 01:17:17.699
BECAUSE I THINK MOST OF THE

01:17:17.766 --> 01:17:19.301
PEOPLE ON THE DíAS HERE WERE

01:17:19.368 --> 01:17:20.902
OF MEMBERS THE LEGISLATURE WHEN

01:17:20.969 --> 01:17:23.839
THAT PACKAGE WAS NEGOTIATED AND

01:17:23.905 --> 01:17:25.507
I WE- WE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR

01:17:25.574 --> 01:17:26.975
THE PURPOSE OF CAP AND TRADE IS

01:17:27.042 --> 01:17:28.043
TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS

01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:29.511
EMISSIONS AND THEY REVENUE THAT

01:17:29.578 --> 01:17:31.279
RAISE THAT GETS RAISED IS KIND

01:17:31.346 --> 01:17:32.948
OF AN ANCILLARY BENEFIT FROM

01:17:33.015 --> 01:17:34.049
THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE SO IT

01:17:34.116 --> 01:17:35.717
REALLY KIND OF ANGERS ME. TO

01:17:35.784 --> 01:17:37.219
HEAR THE PART IN A FINANCIAL

01:17:37.285 --> 01:17:39.287
PINE THAT WE NEED TO MAKE

01:17:39.354 --> 01:17:40.856
CHANGES STRUCTURALLY TO THE

01:17:40.922 --> 01:17:42.024
PROGRAM BECAUSE IT'S NOT

01:17:42.090 --> 01:17:43.959
RAISING OF REVENUE- YOU KNOW

01:17:44.026 --> 01:17:45.360
THE FACT THAT WE'RE SELLING

01:17:45.427 --> 01:17:47.529
FEWER THAN THE NUMBER OF

01:17:47.596 --> 01:17:48.930
EMISSIONS ALLOWANCES THAT WE

01:17:48.997 --> 01:17:49.865
HAVE ON THE MARKET IS A GOOD

01:17:49.931 --> 01:17:51.600
THING IT MEANS THAT GREENHOUSE

01:17:51.666 --> 01:17:53.435
GAS EMISSIONS ARE DECLINING

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:55.270
AND- THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK

01:17:55.337 --> 01:17:56.338
WE SHOULD CELEBRATE AND NOT TRY

01:17:56.405 --> 01:17:58.673
TO FIX- I HAD A QUESTION FOR

01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:00.042
THE LA- ABOUT THAT BECAUSE WE I

01:18:00.108 --> 01:18:01.710
DON'T THINK WE CAN FORGET. YOU

01:18:01.777 --> 01:18:02.844
KNOW WHAT BEFORE FOR MOVE OFF

01:18:02.911 --> 01:18:05.947
THE TOPIC IT OVER TO OKAY THE

01:18:06.014 --> 01:18:06.715
PROGRAMS A GIFT OUT OF CARE AND

01:18:06.782 --> 01:18:10.118
TRADE REVENUES YOU ONE OF THEM

01:18:10.185 --> 01:18:11.319
IS HIGH SPEED RAIL GOT A 20%

01:18:11.386 --> 01:18:13.855
STATURE TO APPROPRIATION FROM

01:18:13.922 --> 01:18:16.358
THAT THOSE FUNDS EVERY YEAR AND

01:18:16.425 --> 01:18:18.860
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE

01:18:18.927 --> 01:18:20.028
THAT THAT IS ONE PROGRAM AMONG

01:18:20.095 --> 01:18:21.029
ALL THESE COPS ALL BUT CERTAIN

01:18:21.096 --> 01:18:26.835
PEOPLE AND. WE'RE WE'RE SO ON

01:18:26.902 --> 01:18:27.936
THIS DIET. ABOUT TO EDUCATION

01:18:28.003 --> 01:18:29.104
TALKED TELECOM TO HELPING

UNTOUCHED. SO IF YOU WANT TO

01:18:33.542 --> 01:18:34.509

01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:36.812
PROGRAM IS HURTING. FOR MAYBE

01:18:36.878 --> 01:18:39.448

01:18:39.514 --> 01:18:41.283
POSTER ONE I JUST WANT. ONE

01:18:41.349 --> 01:18:42.584
VERY QUICKLY I BELIEVE THAT.

01:18:42.651 --> 01:18:45.387
THE ALTHOUGH I MAYBE MISSED. I

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:48.623
BELIEVE IS A- PROPOSAL FOR

01:18:48.690 --> 01:18:50.659
REGARDING AT HOW TO RESPOND IF

01:18:50.725 --> 01:18:51.827
THERE IS LESS REVENUE THAN WE

01:18:51.893 --> 01:18:53.395
ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED. BUT I

01:18:53.462 --> 01:18:53.929
BELIEVE THAT WHAT YOU'RE

01:18:53.995 --> 01:18:55.497
REFERRING TO A IS IN FACT A

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:57.032
LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL THAT WE

01:18:57.099 --> 01:18:57.999
HAVE NOT YET. YEAH ABSOLUTELY I

01:18:58.066 --> 01:18:59.201

GOING TO BEAT UP ON YOU ABOUT

01:19:00.368 --> 01:19:01.937
THAT THE DIET WAS DEPARTMENT OF

THE PURPOSE OF THE PROGRAM WAS

01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:09.177
TO CREATE REVENUE AND THAT'S

01:19:09.244 --> 01:19:10.112
WHAT THAT'S WHAT GOT ME GOING

01:19:10.178 --> 01:19:12.347

OKAY HAPPEN TRADE IS TO REDUCE

01:19:16.785 --> 01:19:18.019

01:19:18.086 --> 01:19:22.190
WANT TO GOOD HERE. I ALSO MIND

01:19:22.257 --> 01:19:23.558
EVERY. THAT IT THAT IS EIGHT.

01:19:23.625 --> 01:19:25.727
THAT WE HAVE CREATED FOR THESE.

01:19:25.794 --> 01:19:27.829
MISSIONS ALLOWANCES AND IN ALSO

01:19:27.896 --> 01:19:29.998
PARK FREE MARKET. APPLY HERE.

01:19:30.065 --> 01:19:30.966
PART OF THE WITH THE-

01:19:31.032 --> 01:19:34.035
LEGISLATURE'S PROPOSAL HERE. IS

01:19:34.102 --> 01:19:36.705
TO RAISE THE FLOOR PRICE. FOR

01:19:36.771 --> 01:19:38.140
THESE ALLOWANCES AND SO I HAVE

01:19:38.206 --> 01:19:39.841
A QUESTION FOR MR PADDOCK YOU

01:19:39.908 --> 01:19:41.543
GIVEN THAT THIS IS A FREE

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:43.345
MARKET SITUATION WOULDN'T

01:19:43.411 --> 01:19:51.586
RAISING THE FLOOR PROGRESS.

01:19:51.653 --> 01:19:52.954
RESULT IN FEWER ALLOWANCES.

01:19:53.021 --> 01:19:55.557
SOLD TIONS. IT'S NOT A- I SEE

01:19:55.624 --> 01:20:01.830
WHAT. TO THE MARKET. THE I

01:20:01.897 --> 01:20:02.831
THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE A

01:20:02.898 --> 01:20:04.733
REASONABLE INTERPRETATION. OKAY

01:20:04.799 --> 01:20:06.601
LET'S HOME ON THE MARKET IS

01:20:06.668 --> 01:20:07.235
THAT IF WE MOVE FOR WITH THIS

01:20:07.302 --> 01:20:08.336
PER. WHICH I THINK CAME OVER

01:20:08.403 --> 01:20:10.172
FROM THIS IN WE ARE NOT

01:20:10.238 --> 01:20:10.772
GUARANTEED THAT THIS GOING TO

01:20:10.839 --> 01:20:11.640
PRODUCE MORE REVS AT MY PRETTY

01:20:11.706 --> 01:20:12.774
ROUTE LIE REVENUE IF YOU RAISE

01:20:12.841 --> 01:20:14.242
THE PRICE OF SOMETHING PEOPLE

01:20:14.309 --> 01:20:16.111
BUY LESS OF IT AND SO I THINK

01:20:16.178 --> 01:20:17.479
TO ASSUME THE JUST RAISING THE

01:20:17.546 --> 01:20:18.947
FOR PRICE IS GOING TO RESULT IN

01:20:19.014 --> 01:20:20.549
THE RESTORATION OF THE FUNDING

01:20:20.615 --> 01:20:23.218
TO THE PROGRAMS IN THE CAP AND

01:20:23.285 --> 01:20:23.785
TRADE PROGRAM I THINK THAT

01:20:23.852 --> 01:20:26.821
THAT'S FOOLISH. I'M WELL I GOT

01:20:26.888 --> 01:20:27.956
YOU MISTER PATRICK- I WANTED TO

01:20:28.023 --> 01:20:30.625
ASK ABOUT. THE FISCAL

01:20:30.692 --> 01:20:32.427
RESPONSIBILITY OF SOME OF THE

01:20:32.494 --> 01:20:33.628
THINGS LEGISLATURE'S PROPOSING

01:20:33.695 --> 01:20:35.931
TO DO IN THIS BUDGET SO- WHEN

01:20:35.997 --> 01:20:37.299
WE FIRST WERE EXAMINING THE

01:20:37.365 --> 01:20:38.967
GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE I

01:20:39.034 --> 01:20:40.969
EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS ABOUT.

01:20:41.036 --> 01:20:42.671
THE AMOUNT OF. THEIR PHONE

01:20:42.737 --> 01:20:43.905
BORROWING- THE GOVERNOR HE

01:20:43.972 --> 01:20:45.540
PROPOSED OVER TEN BILLION

01:20:45.607 --> 01:20:46.741
DOLLARS OF INTER FUND BORROWING

01:20:46.808 --> 01:20:47.909
THAT MONEY'S GOT TO BE PAID

01:20:47.976 --> 01:20:49.277
BACK. WE'RE BORROWING FROM

01:20:49.344 --> 01:20:50.612
FUNDS WITH RESTRICTED USES

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:51.413
PUTTING THAT MONEY THE GENERAL

01:20:51.479 --> 01:20:53.415
FUND. AND WE HAVE TO PAY THAT

01:20:53.481 --> 01:20:54.583
MONEY BACK IN THE FUTURE SO I

01:20:54.649 --> 01:20:55.917
WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.

01:20:55.984 --> 01:20:57.485
UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE GOING TO BE

01:20:57.552 --> 01:20:58.453
UNDER THE LEGISLATURE'S

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.789
PROPOSAL. BORROWING OVER A

01:21:00.855 --> 01:21:02.490
BILLION DOLLARS MORE- ALSO

01:21:02.557 --> 01:21:03.558
EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE

01:21:03.625 --> 01:21:05.293
AMOUNT OF DEFERRALS I MEAN

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:06.461
OBVIOUSLY TO FOR OVER JUST

01:21:06.528 --> 01:21:07.495
PAYING MONEY WILL. WORK JUST

01:21:07.562 --> 01:21:08.797
PAYING OUR BILLS A DAY LATE SO

01:21:08.863 --> 01:21:09.764
WE CAN SAY THAT THEIR NEXT

01:21:09.831 --> 01:21:11.433
YEAR'S BILLS. INSTEAD OF THIS

01:21:11.499 --> 01:21:12.500
YEAR'S BILLS THAT MIGHT HELP US

01:21:12.567 --> 01:21:13.969
THIS YEAR DOES NOT HELP US NEXT

01:21:14.035 --> 01:21:15.637
YEAR MAKES THINGS WORSE. SO THE

01:21:15.704 --> 01:21:17.038
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED FIVE

01:21:17.105 --> 01:21:18.506
BILLION DOLLARS IN DEFERRALS-

01:21:18.573 --> 01:21:20.208
WE'RE DOUBLING DOWN ON THAT

01:21:20.275 --> 01:21:21.843
GIMMICK WE WANT TO- IF THE

01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:23.478
FEDERAL TRIGGERED. GETS AN

01:21:23.545 --> 01:21:26.648
ACTED WE WANT TO BORROW OVER-TEN. BILLION DOLLARS AND

01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:28.083
DEFERRALS. SO I I'M I'M

01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:29.584
WONDERING BECAUSE MISTER. THIS

01:21:29.651 --> 01:21:30.986
ONE EATEN UP. RAISE THE POINT

01:21:31.052 --> 01:21:33.388
IN HIS OPENING. THAT THAT WE'RE

01:21:33.455 --> 01:21:34.689
ALL CONCERNED ABOUT LONG TERM

01:21:34.756 --> 01:21:36.057
STRUCTURAL BUDGET DEFICITS HERE

01:21:36.124 --> 01:21:37.892
IN THESE THINGS THAT. WE'RE

01:21:37.959 --> 01:21:39.227
PROPOSING TO DO THE BUDGET MAKE

01:21:39.294 --> 01:21:40.462
THAT PROBLEM WORSE NOT BETTER

01:21:40.528 --> 01:21:42.397
SO- IN YOUR OPINION IS THIS OR

01:21:42.464 --> 01:21:43.798
IS IT OR IS RESPONSIBLE STEPS

01:21:43.865 --> 01:21:50.372
TO TAKE. I THERE'S A- OF. I

01:21:50.438 --> 01:21:51.339
WOULD MAY ABOUT INTEREST. TO

01:21:51.406 --> 01:21:52.540
THAT MR OBERNOLTE. THE FIRST IS

01:21:52.607 --> 01:21:53.575
THAT THE STATE IS LIKELY TO BE

01:21:53.642 --> 01:21:55.310
FACING A STRUCTURAL PROBLEM

01:21:55.377 --> 01:21:56.778
UNDER ALMOST ANY OF THE

01:21:56.845 --> 01:21:58.747
SCENARIOS THAT. ARE WE ARE ALL

01:21:58.813 --> 01:22:00.548
CONSIDERING TODAY. UNDER THE

01:22:00.615 --> 01:22:02.284
MAY REVISION UNDER THE

01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:04.586
LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE. AND UNDER

01:22:04.653 --> 01:22:06.054
THIS SCENARIO IN WHICH WE EVEN

01:22:06.121 --> 01:22:07.055
GET ADDITIONAL FEDERAL

01:22:07.122 --> 01:22:08.723
ASSISTANCE MOST LIKELY ALMOST

01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:09.758
CERTAINLY THAT FEDERAL

01:22:09.824 --> 01:22:11.192
ASSISTANCE WOULD BE LIMITED

01:22:11.259 --> 01:22:12.761
TERM IN NATURE ONE OR TWO YEARS

01:22:12.827 --> 01:22:14.829
AT THE MOST AND SO. AT THAT

01:22:14.896 --> 01:22:15.630
POINT THERE COULD BE

01:22:15.697 --> 01:22:18.266
ADDITIONAL- STRUCTURAL PRESSURE

01:22:18.333 --> 01:22:20.068
ON THE BUDGET. I THINK AS

01:22:20.135 --> 01:22:22.771
MISTER MISS WHEN A THIN SAID-

01:22:22.837 --> 01:22:24.873
BUT YOU KNOW HE'S CORRECT THAT-

01:22:24.939 --> 01:22:27.776
THAT- THE- YOU KNOW THE FUTURE.

01:22:27.842 --> 01:22:30.578
BUDGET OUTLOOK IS THAT TERE IS

01:22:30.645 --> 01:22:33.048
NOT A- YOU KNOW. BASED ON OUR

01:22:33.114 --> 01:22:34.249
CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS IN WHAT WE

01:22:34.316 --> 01:22:35.617
HAVE WITH THE INFORMATION WE

01:22:35.684 --> 01:22:37.886
HAVE TODAY. THERE WOULD BE A

01:22:37.952 --> 01:22:38.953
BUDGET PROBLEM IN THE OUT

01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:41.489
YEARS- IT. UNDER PRETTY MUCH

01:22:41.556 --> 01:22:43.491
ANY OF THESE SCENARIOS SO WITH

01:22:43.558 --> 01:22:45.360
THAT SAID. THEN THE QUESTION

01:22:45.427 --> 01:22:50.665
IS- I THINK ONE OF BALANCE IN

01:22:50.732 --> 01:22:51.166
WHAT I HAVE SORT OF THE

01:22:51.232 --> 01:22:51.700
LEGISLATIVE. COLLECTIVELY

01:22:51.766 --> 01:22:53.368
WHAT'S THE LEGISLATURE'S RISK

01:22:53.435 --> 01:22:55.970
TOLERANCE AND TO THE EXTENT YOU

01:22:56.037 --> 01:22:57.605
USE MORE OF THE ONE TIME

01:22:57.672 --> 01:23:01.543
RESOURCES NOW. IT DOES- REDUCE

01:23:01.609 --> 01:23:03.578
PROBABLY THE HUMAN TOLL THAT IS

01:23:03.645 --> 01:23:05.513
BEING TAKEN BY THE EFFECTS OF

01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:07.382
THE COVERT NINETEEN AND THE

01:23:07.449 --> 01:23:10.418
RECESSION. ON PEOPLE THAT ARE-

01:23:10.485 --> 01:23:13.822
BENEFICIARIES OF STATE PROGRAMS

01:23:13.888 --> 01:23:16.124
SO YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S-

01:23:16.191 --> 01:23:18.426
CLEARLY ONE CONSIDERATION BUT

01:23:18.493 --> 01:23:20.161
THEN ON THE ON THE OTHER HAND

01:23:20.228 --> 01:23:21.629
IF YOUR VIEW IS THAT THE

01:23:21.696 --> 01:23:24.399
ECONOMY WILL STILL BE IN IT YOU

01:23:24.466 --> 01:23:26.201
KNOW DEPRESSED CONDITION NEXT

01:23:26.267 --> 01:23:28.269
YEAR AT THIS TIME. WE WILL HAVE

01:23:28.336 --> 01:23:30.705
FEWER- ONE TIME RESOURCES

01:23:30.772 --> 01:23:33.174
AVAILABLE TO US AND THEN MORE

01:23:33.241 --> 01:23:35.009
ONGOING TYPES OF SOLUTIONS

01:23:35.076 --> 01:23:37.178
WOULD THEN BE NECESSARY. IF ON

01:23:37.245 --> 01:23:38.413
THE OTHER HAND YOU FELT THAT

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:41.015
THE ECONOMY IS- ITS JUST AT

01:23:41.082 --> 01:23:42.884
SOME LEVEL REACHING- TROUGH

01:23:42.951 --> 01:23:44.619
HERE IN THE IN THE NEXT COUPLE

01:23:44.686 --> 01:23:45.820
OF MONTHS AND THAT WE WILL

01:23:45.887 --> 01:23:48.423
BEGIN TO RECOVER AND BY NEXT

01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:49.691
YEAR AT THIS TIME THE ECONOMY

01:23:49.758 --> 01:23:51.793
IS IN A- MUCH MORE OF A GROWTH

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:54.095
MODE. THOSE KIND OF SOLUTIONS

01:23:54.162 --> 01:23:57.732
WOULD BE LESS LESS NEEDED BUT I

01:23:57.799 --> 01:23:59.167
DON'T THINK ANY OF US KNOW AT

01:23:59.234 --> 01:24:00.535
THIS TIME WHAT THAT WILL WHAT

01:24:00.602 --> 01:24:04.706
THAT WILL LOOK LIKE- AND SO TO

01:24:04.773 --> 01:24:06.875
SOME EXTENT IT REALLY EPENDS I

01:24:06.941 --> 01:24:10.345
THINK ON YOUR- WILLINGNESS TO

01:24:10.412 --> 01:24:12.147
ASSUME THAT SOME AMOUNT OF

01:24:12.213 --> 01:24:15.316
RISK. ABOUT THE ECONOMIC

01:24:15.383 --> 01:24:17.352
OUTLOOK AT THIS POINT. THANK

01:24:17.419 --> 01:24:19.287
YOU ARE YOU KNOW I JUST WANT

01:24:19.354 --> 01:24:20.855
EVERYONE TO FOCUS ON THE AMOUNT

01:24:20.922 --> 01:24:21.456
OF RISK THAT WE'RE CONSIDERING

01:24:21.523 --> 01:24:23.224
TAKING HERE WE'RE TALKING AT

01:24:23.291 --> 01:24:24.959
TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS. EVEN

01:24:25.026 --> 01:24:26.661
WHEN THINGS WERE GOING WELL WE

01:24:26.728 --> 01:24:28.096
HAD ABOUT A SIX BILLION DOLLAR

01:24:28.163 --> 01:24:30.231
BUDGET SURPLUS THIS YEAR THAT

01:24:30.298 --> 01:24:31.766
WAS A BACK IN JANUARY I MEAN

01:24:31.833 --> 01:24:33.301
THAT MEANS THAT IF AT THAT

01:24:33.368 --> 01:24:34.369
LEVEL OF ECONOMIC GROWTH IT

01:24:34.436 --> 01:24:37.205
WOULD TAKE US THREE AND A HALF

01:24:37.272 --> 01:24:37.806
YEARS TO PAY THAT MONEY BACK-

01:24:37.872 --> 01:24:39.441
AND IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A

01:24:39.507 --> 01:24:41.209
SNORT. WE DON'T HAVE ECONOMIC

01:24:41.276 --> 01:24:42.377
GROWTH THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:24:42.444 --> 01:24:45.847
THE THAT'S GOING TO TAKE EVEN

01:24:45.914 --> 01:24:46.414
LONGER AND THAT'S JUST A ONE

01:24:46.481 --> 01:24:47.749
YEAR PROBLEM IF YOU'RE ASSUME

01:24:47.816 --> 01:24:49.918
IF YOU'RE- ASSUMING THAT WE'RE

01:24:49.984 --> 01:24:50.952
GOING TO HAVE A STRUCTURAL

01:24:51.019 --> 01:24:53.388
DEFICIT AS BOTH THE ONLY WHEN

01:24:53.455 --> 01:24:55.323
THE DEAL AFTER. PROJECT FOR

01:24:55.390 --> 01:24:57.459
THIS YEAR I MEAN THE WE'RE

01:24:57.525 --> 01:25:00.628
GOING TO BE. BE BACK NEXT YEAR

01:25:00.695 --> 01:25:01.262
WE'RE TO KICK THE CAN DOWN THE

01:25:01.329 --> 01:25:03.031
ROAD THE WAS JUST GONNA BIGGER

01:25:03.097 --> 01:25:06.334
SAY THAT'S MIKE ABOUT THAT AND

01:25:06.401 --> 01:25:08.036
LAST BUT FOR MISTER THIS ONE

01:25:08.102 --> 01:25:10.772
EITHER YOU KNOW BUT SENATE

01:25:10.839 --> 01:25:12.640
OPENING ABOUT. YOU TALK ABOUT

01:25:12.707 --> 01:25:14.375
OPTIMISM THAT. FEDERAL WOULD

01:25:14.442 --> 01:25:20.181
ACT AND WILL PROVIDE ADDITION.

01:25:20.248 --> 01:25:22.350
FEDERAL FUNDING PENDANT ACOSTA

01:25:22.417 --> 01:25:25.019
IT'S- AND I'M ON IF YOU COULD

01:25:25.086 --> 01:25:25.887
ALLOW A LITTLE BIT A WHAT LEVEL

01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:29.757
OF. IS THAT THE GOING TO. ASK I

01:25:29.824 --> 01:25:30.325
DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE A GREAT

01:25:30.391 --> 01:25:30.925
AUNT TO THAT. I WOULD SAY IN

01:25:30.992 --> 01:25:33.795
THE LAST DAYS WE'VE SO HOPEFUL

01:25:33.862 --> 01:25:34.395
SIGNALS OUR PARTNER AND WATCH

01:25:34.462 --> 01:25:36.297
DC. AND IT DOES THAT SOME KIND

01:25:36.364 --> 01:25:37.599
OF PATH DOES TO BE MOVING

01:25:37.665 --> 01:25:39.133
PERHAPS ON A MORE BIPARTISAN

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:40.602
BASIS THEN WE MIGHT HAVE

01:25:40.668 --> 01:25:42.570
EXPECTED A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.

01:25:42.637 --> 01:25:43.771
THAT BEING SAID AT THE REASON

01:25:43.838 --> 01:25:46.274
ARMY REVISION- STARTS WITH THE

01:25:46.341 --> 01:25:47.842
TRIGGER CUTS IF THE FUNDING IT

01:25:47.909 --> 01:25:49.143
DOES NOT COME IN ON JULY FIRST

01:25:49.210 --> 01:25:51.079
IS BECAUSE- THE GOVERNOR'S

01:25:51.145 --> 01:25:52.580
BELIEF WAS A WASTE WHEN HE PUT

01:25:52.647 --> 01:25:53.414
UP IN A REVISION ON MAY

01:25:53.481 --> 01:25:55.250
FOURTEENTH. THAT WHILE WE ARE

01:25:55.316 --> 01:25:56.818
HOPING AND PUSHING FOR

01:25:56.885 --> 01:25:58.019
CONGRESSIONAL ACTION WE

01:25:58.086 --> 01:25:59.254
COULDN'T COUNT ON IT AT THAT

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:00.755
TIME THE SIGNALS IN THE LAST

01:26:00.822 --> 01:26:02.190
COUPLE WEEKS HAVE CERTAINLY

01:26:02.257 --> 01:26:03.825
GOTTEN BETTER BUT- AT THIS

01:26:03.892 --> 01:26:04.626
POINT I WOULD STILL DESCRIBE

01:26:04.692 --> 01:26:05.727
THIS IS VERY CAUTIOUSLY

01:26:05.793 --> 01:26:07.562
OPTIMISTIC. OKAY I HOPE YOU'RE

01:26:07.629 --> 01:26:09.130
RIGHT- I'M I'M A LITTLE MORE

01:26:09.197 --> 01:26:10.565
PESSIMISTIC THAN YOU ARE ONLY

01:26:10.632 --> 01:26:11.966
BECAUSE LOOKING AT THE

01:26:12.033 --> 01:26:13.835
CONGRESSIONAL CALENDAR IT SEEMS

01:26:13.902 --> 01:26:16.538
TO ME LIKE- THE HOUSE OF

01:26:16.604 --> 01:26:18.172
REPRESENTATIVES ONLY IN SESSION

01:26:18.239 --> 01:26:19.374
THIRTEEN DAYS BETWEEN NOW AND

01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:20.842
THE TRIGGER DATE THAT THE

01:26:20.909 --> 01:26:22.477
LEGISLATURE SET UP OF THE FIRST

01:26:22.544 --> 01:26:24.245
OF SEPTEMBER. SO THAT'S IMPLIED

01:26:24.312 --> 01:26:26.814
HAVE REALLY SHORT TIME HORIZON

01:26:26.881 --> 01:26:28.650
TO ENACT SUCH A MOMENTOUS PIECE

01:26:28.716 --> 01:26:30.685
OF LEGISLATION SO I WILL

01:26:30.752 --> 01:26:31.920
CERTAINLY FIND OUT BUT I WANNA

01:26:31.986 --> 01:26:33.187
CAUTIOUS ALL OF CAUTION ALL OF

01:26:33.254 --> 01:26:35.957
US THAT. THE PRETENDING THAT

01:26:36.024 --> 01:26:37.559
THIS IS GOING TO THE PRETENDING

01:26:37.625 --> 01:26:39.027
THERE'S A HOW 2% CHANCE OF THIS

01:26:39.093 --> 01:26:40.562
HAPPENING IS VERY ANALYZE.

01:26:40.628 --> 01:26:43.665
RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN.

01:26:43.731 --> 01:26:44.799
I THINK YOU WERE GONNA GOODNESS

01:26:44.866 --> 01:26:47.402
MCCARTY NEXT. THE YOU AND

01:26:47.468 --> 01:26:50.138
MISTER CHAIR I I'VE SERIES OF

01:26:50.204 --> 01:26:51.739
HERE BUT I THINK I THINK IT'S

01:26:51.806 --> 01:26:52.340
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT EVERY

01:26:52.407 --> 01:26:54.108
VOTE WE TAKE UP HERE IS A RISK

01:26:54.175 --> 01:26:55.577
AND REWARD WE HAVE TO ANALYZE

01:26:55.643 --> 01:26:57.745
THE DOWNSIDES. AND OF COURSE

01:26:57.812 --> 01:26:59.047
THE UP SIDES AND I DON'T KNOW

01:26:59.113 --> 01:27:00.915
WE CAN CONSIDER THIS A PURITY

01:27:00.982 --> 01:27:02.784
TEST FOR AN AUSTERITY BUDGET

01:27:02.850 --> 01:27:03.851
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE FLIP SIDE

01:27:03.918 --> 01:27:06.187
BECAUSE- THIS ISN'T A TYPICAL

01:27:06.254 --> 01:27:08.089
RECESSION. WE'VE HAD IN THE

01:27:08.156 --> 01:27:09.958
PAST FEW DECADES THIS IS ONE

01:27:10.024 --> 01:27:11.492
THAT WAS BORN BY S. LITERALLY

01:27:11.559 --> 01:27:14.395
TURNING OFF THE ECONOMY SO IF

01:27:14.462 --> 01:27:16.564
WE WANT TO GET PEOPLE BACK TO

01:27:16.631 --> 01:27:18.499
WORK GET CONSUMER SPENDING BACK

01:27:18.566 --> 01:27:21.002
GOING GETTING OUR R. HEALTHCARE

01:27:21.069 --> 01:27:23.705
NETWORK- WORKING PROPERLY AS

01:27:23.771 --> 01:27:25.473
DOCTOR ARAMBULA SAID THESE ARE

01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:27.909
CHOICES WE HAVE TO MAKE SO-

01:27:27.976 --> 01:27:29.844
KEEPING THE STATE OF FLOAT. AND

01:27:29.911 --> 01:27:31.946
KEEPING OUR SYSTEMS OF LOW THAT

01:27:32.013 --> 01:27:33.348
MAKE CALIFORNIA AT WORK AND

01:27:33.414 --> 01:27:34.649
HAVE PEOPLE GO BACK TO WORK IS

01:27:34.716 --> 01:27:36.651
A CHOICE WE'RE MAKING- SO I

01:27:36.718 --> 01:27:38.152
THINK THAT YOU HAVE TO ALSO

01:27:38.219 --> 01:27:39.454
LOOK AT THE FLIP SIDE IF WE

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:41.456
DIDN'T MAKE THESE CHOICES. OURS

01:27:41.522 --> 01:27:42.724
IS OUR ECONOMY GONNA BE

01:27:42.790 --> 01:27:44.826
FLOUNDERING FOR YEARS DOWN THE

01:27:44.892 --> 01:27:46.227
ROAD I THINK DURING LAST

01:27:46.294 --> 01:27:47.895
RECESSION WHENEVER NOTABLE

01:27:47.962 --> 01:27:49.330
ECONOMISTS AS OUR OUR BUDGETARY

01:27:49.397 --> 01:27:51.532
REMINDS US FROM- UC BERKELEY%

01:27:51.599 --> 01:27:56.037
DOCTOR D'ANDREA TYSON TALKED

01:27:56.104 --> 01:27:56.771
ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY.

01:27:56.838 --> 01:27:59.073
STYLIST WAS WELL ABLE TO RE. US

01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:01.376
QUICKLY WE MAY SO MUCH

01:28:01.442 --> 01:28:03.444
DRACONIAN CUTS TO ALL PROGRAMS

01:28:03.511 --> 01:28:03.945
THAT JUST YOU KNOW KEEP

01:28:04.012 --> 01:28:06.514
CALIFORNIA. SO I THINK WE JUST

01:28:06.581 --> 01:28:07.615
BE MINDFUL ABOUT THAT THE

01:28:07.682 --> 01:28:10.718
CHOICES WE MAKE. YOU KNOW FOCUS

01:28:10.785 --> 01:28:12.987
ON THE BIG PICTURE AS WELL I DO

01:28:13.054 --> 01:28:14.656
HAVE. A FEW QUESTIONS I WANT TO

01:28:14.722 --> 01:28:16.357
START RIGHT HERE WITH MY OWN

01:28:16.424 --> 01:28:18.192
DISTRICT- THE STATE CAPITAL OF

01:28:18.259 --> 01:28:20.161
COURSE- BIG PART OF OUR

01:28:20.228 --> 01:28:21.629
CONSTITUENCY OUR OUR STATE

01:28:21.696 --> 01:28:24.365
WORKERS. AND IN THE PROPOSAL IN

01:28:24.432 --> 01:28:27.468
IN- IN THE MAY REVISED YOU PUSH

01:28:27.535 --> 01:28:30.138
FOR THAT AT THAT 10% POTENTIAL-

01:28:30.204 --> 01:28:33.007
CUT TO. STATE WORKER SALARY IN

01:28:33.074 --> 01:28:35.576
IT WOULD GENERATE A ONE POINT

01:28:35.643 --> 01:28:37.845
SEVEN BILLION. I THINK WE PULL

01:28:37.912 --> 01:28:39.280
BACK A LITTLE BIT OUR BUDGET

01:28:39.347 --> 01:28:41.449
DOESN'T DOESN'T- AS ALIEN NOTES

01:28:41.516 --> 01:28:43.184
DOESN'T ASSUME THAT AMOUNT AND-

01:28:43.251 --> 01:28:44.919
WOULD- PUT TIS TO THE

01:28:44.986 --> 01:28:46.220
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS I

01:28:46.287 --> 01:28:49.991
THINK THE- THE LOCAL ENTITIES.

01:28:50.058 --> 01:28:51.459
LED BY S. C. ONE THOUSAND. ARE

01:28:51.526 --> 01:28:53.428
TALKING ABOUT OTHER WAYS TO

01:28:53.494 --> 01:28:55.063
HAVE TO HELP THE STATE AND THIS

01:28:55.129 --> 01:28:56.397
IS LOW PREMATURE TO BECAUSE WE

01:28:56.464 --> 01:28:57.165
DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WE'RE

01:28:57.231 --> 01:28:57.899
GETTING FROM THE FEDERAL

01:28:57.965 --> 01:28:59.500
GOVERNMENT TO HELP US BRIDGE

01:28:59.567 --> 01:29:01.569
NEXT COUPLE YOURSELF. ONE OF

01:29:01.636 --> 01:29:02.637
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE COULD AND

01:29:02.704 --> 01:29:03.938
LIGHTNESS WE'RE AT WITH OUR

01:29:04.005 --> 01:29:06.174
STATE WORKERS. YES SO I CAN

01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:07.475
ONLY SPEAK ON IT VERY AT

01:29:07.542 --> 01:29:09.010
GENERAL LEVEL I'LL MAKE TWO

01:29:09.077 --> 01:29:10.878
POINTS I THINK NUMBER ONE OUR

01:29:10.945 --> 01:29:13.081
POSITION- IS ALSO WITH REGARD

01:29:13.147 --> 01:29:13.781
TO THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

01:29:13.848 --> 01:29:15.283
PROCESS THAT THAT IS WHERE WE

01:29:15.349 --> 01:29:16.751
DO WANT TO. ACHIEVE THOSE

01:29:16.818 --> 01:29:19.620
SAVINGS SO FOR THAT 10% OF

01:29:19.687 --> 01:29:21.689
REDUCTION- THAT'S ASSUMED IN

01:29:21.756 --> 01:29:23.157
THE BUDGET BUT IN TERMS OF HOW

01:29:23.224 --> 01:29:27.095
IT GETS DONE- WE ARE HOPING TO

01:29:27.161 --> 01:29:28.096
ACHIEVE THAT AT THE BARGAINING

01:29:28.162 --> 01:29:29.831
TABLE OFFER ALL THE- BARGAINING

01:29:29.897 --> 01:29:31.599
UNITS- AND THAT'S- THE SECOND

01:29:31.666 --> 01:29:32.934
POINT I'LL MAKE IS WITH REGARD

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:33.701
TO THE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT.

01:29:33.768 --> 01:29:36.304
WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING- THAT IS

01:29:36.370 --> 01:29:38.272
ONE OF THE TRIGGER POT SO IF

01:29:38.339 --> 01:29:39.941
WASHINGTON DC DOES COME.

01:29:40.007 --> 01:29:41.075
FORWARD WITH THE REQUISITE

01:29:41.142 --> 01:29:41.576
LEVEL OF STATE AND LOCAL

01:29:41.642 --> 01:29:43.277
ASSISTANCE DâN THAT THOSE

01:29:43.344 --> 01:29:48.750
CUTS- WOULD BE RESTORED. OKAY

01:29:48.816 --> 01:29:50.284
SO WHAT'S THE TIME LINE FOR ALL

01:29:50.351 --> 01:29:52.253
THAT HAPPENING I'LL GET ON THE

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:54.088
MAY REVISE YOU YOU PUT AN AD

01:29:54.155 --> 01:29:56.290
NUMBER IN THERE AND AMOUNTS AND

01:29:56.357 --> 01:29:57.458
IT KIND OF SET DIFFERENT

01:29:57.525 --> 01:30:00.228
EXPECTATIONS SO HOW DOES THAT.

01:30:00.294 --> 01:30:02.063
HOW HOW'S THAT EVOLVED IN THE

01:30:02.130 --> 01:30:05.733
LAST. MONTH SO I CAN I. WOULD

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:07.201
HAVE TO CHECK THAT WITH OURS

01:30:07.268 --> 01:30:08.169
FOLKS OR WORKING WITH PEOPLE

01:30:08.236 --> 01:30:09.837
THE BARGAINING SO LET ME BACK

01:30:09.904 --> 01:30:13.040
TO THAT OKAY I WANTED TO. NOW

01:30:13.107 --> 01:30:15.810
THE REVENUE ISSUES REVENUE

01:30:15.877 --> 01:30:18.613
IDEAS I KNOW THAT- YOU KNOW MY

01:30:18.679 --> 01:30:19.614
COLLEAGUE FROM ELK GROVE REYES

01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:20.948
SAID CONCERNS AS FAR AS THE

01:30:21.015 --> 01:30:22.884
IMPACT OF CERTAIN INDUSTRIES. I

01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:24.118
KNOW THERE ARE ARE ARE MANY

01:30:24.185 --> 01:30:25.586
PEOPLE LEGISLATURE THAT WANT TO

01:30:25.653 --> 01:30:28.122
PUT. EVEN MORE REVENUE IDEAS ON

01:30:28.189 --> 01:30:29.490
THE TABLE POTENTIALLY GO TO THE

01:30:29.557 --> 01:30:31.325
BALLOT TO REALLY LOOK AT. THE

01:30:31.392 --> 01:30:34.362
OVERALL- FUNDING FOR. KEY

01:30:34.428 --> 01:30:35.930
PROGRAMS LIKE EDUCATION OUR

01:30:35.997 --> 01:30:37.098
STATE AND I BY PERSONALLY

01:30:37.165 --> 01:30:38.800
SUPPORT THAT LOOKING AT AT

01:30:38.866 --> 01:30:40.668
REVENUE INCREASES BUT- I THINK

01:30:40.735 --> 01:30:43.271
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT-

01:30:43.337 --> 01:30:44.906
THIS IS AGAIN ABOUT CHOICES AND

01:30:44.972 --> 01:30:46.407
RISK REWARD DO WE WANT TO KEEP

01:30:46.474 --> 01:30:47.241
THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA

01:30:47.308 --> 01:30:49.177
FLOAT. WHICH IS THE MAJOR ARE

01:30:49.243 --> 01:30:50.444
INDEED DRIVER FOR OUR FOR OUR

01:30:50.511 --> 01:30:52.280
STATE. OUR C. S. YOUR COMMITTEE

01:30:52.346 --> 01:30:53.581
COLLEGES ARE CAR K. TWELVE

01:30:53.648 --> 01:30:55.283
SCHOOLS AND SO. HAVING THAT

01:30:55.349 --> 01:30:58.152
TIME OUT ON THESE FOR A NUMBER

01:30:58.219 --> 01:30:59.720
OF US SEVERAL YEARS AND NOT BE

01:30:59.787 --> 01:31:01.289
THE PERMANENT IN THE NATION. I

01:31:01.355 --> 01:31:03.691
THINK IS THE CHOICE THAT WE

01:31:03.758 --> 01:31:04.392
HAVE TO MAKE SO WE CANNOT DO

01:31:04.458 --> 01:31:06.294
THAT. AND WE CAN WE CAN SAY

01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:07.128
OKAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO THAT

01:31:07.195 --> 01:31:08.696
AND I WOULD JUST TELL PEOPLE

01:31:08.763 --> 01:31:10.965
WHO ARGUE THAT. OKAY GIVE US

01:31:11.032 --> 01:31:12.834
THE CUTS GIVE US TO GIVE US THE

01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:13.768
PLACES YOU WANT TO CUT. YOU

01:31:13.835 --> 01:31:15.269
WANT TO CUT WHEN WHAT'S THE

01:31:15.336 --> 01:31:16.337
AMOUNT AGAIN ON THE OTHER DAY

01:31:16.404 --> 01:31:17.738
FOR THE NEW REVENUES TOGETHER

01:31:17.805 --> 01:31:19.373
IT'S ABOUT A LITTLE OVER FOUR

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:20.508
BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR.

01:31:20.575 --> 01:31:22.143
KERR US SO IT CHANGES YEAR TO

01:31:22.210 --> 01:31:23.377
YEAR BUT IN THE COMING YEAR

01:31:23.444 --> 01:31:24.679
IT'LL BE FOUR POINT FOUR BILL

01:31:24.745 --> 01:31:26.447
OKAY YEAH. SO I SENSUALLY AS

01:31:26.514 --> 01:31:28.182
THE STATE EQUIVALENT FOR THE

01:31:28.249 --> 01:31:30.318
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. SO IF

01:31:30.384 --> 01:31:31.219
THERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO GO ABOUT

01:31:31.285 --> 01:31:33.621
DOING THAT. I'M ALL YOURS BUT-

01:31:33.688 --> 01:31:34.689
I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A

01:31:34.755 --> 01:31:36.591
REALITY CHECK ON JUST THE

01:31:36.657 --> 01:31:39.760
SIMPLE MATHEMATICS SO THAT- I

01:31:39.827 --> 01:31:41.896
ALSO WANT TO JUST. A LIEU THAT

01:31:41.963 --> 01:31:43.731
I DO SUPPORT HOW WE'RE RE

01:31:43.798 --> 01:31:45.766
EVALUATING THAT THAT CAP AND

01:31:45.833 --> 01:31:49.237
TRADE- PLAN IN OUR PROPOSAL BUT

01:31:49.303 --> 01:31:51.105
I WILL NOTE THAT I AM. VERY

01:31:51.172 --> 01:31:51.939
VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE

01:31:52.006 --> 01:31:54.642
HIGH SPEED EL. AUTOMATIC I'M

01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:56.677
25% OFF THE BOARD AND I'M

01:31:56.744 --> 01:31:57.778
WAITING FOR THE MOMENT RIGHT

01:31:57.845 --> 01:31:59.780
CAN VOTE TO. RESEND THAT I

01:31:59.847 --> 01:32:02.083
THINK THAT WE ARE BETTER WAYS

01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:03.117
TO SPEND THAT MONEY THAT FOCUS

01:32:03.184 --> 01:32:05.453
ON OUR NEED. EVEN AND WELL AND

01:32:05.519 --> 01:32:06.153
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND

01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:07.788
TRANSIT. AND COMMUTER RAIL FROM

01:32:07.855 --> 01:32:09.690
HERE TO THE BAY AREA FROM LA TO

01:32:09.757 --> 01:32:16.364
ORANGE. COUNTY UP AND DOWN THE

01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:16.998
ON. THIS THE CENTRAL VALLEY THE

01:32:17.064 --> 01:32:17.565
ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE MY

01:32:17.632 --> 01:32:18.266
BETTER. TO ON THOSE DAHLE. ON

01:32:18.332 --> 01:32:19.433
COMMUTER RAIL THEY CAN ACTUALLY

01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:21.135
WORK. THAT WERE POPULAR BASES

01:32:21.202 --> 01:32:22.536
LIVE. AND WE HAVE A BIGGER

01:32:22.603 --> 01:32:24.538
IMPACT ON REDUCING. OUR CARBON

01:32:24.605 --> 01:32:26.440
FOOTPRINT IN CALIFORNIA SO I DO

01:32:26.507 --> 01:32:29.243
CONCUR ON THAT- I WANT TO NOW

01:32:29.310 --> 01:32:29.810
SHE HAVE TO THE AREA THAT I

01:32:29.877 --> 01:32:31.512
FOCUSED MONTHS. MOST ON THE

01:32:31.579 --> 01:32:33.648
BUDGET AND THAT'S- EDUCATION

01:32:33.714 --> 01:32:35.650
FROM EARLY EDUCATION THROUGH.

01:32:35.716 --> 01:32:37.385
THROUGH HIGHER IN K. TWELVE IN

01:32:37.451 --> 01:32:40.321
THE MIDDLE- YOU KNOW THE CUTS

01:32:40.388 --> 01:32:41.989
POTENTIAL CUTS IN THE TRIGGER

01:32:42.056 --> 01:32:44.191
FOR. THAT THEY MAY REVISE. I

01:32:44.258 --> 01:32:46.827
THINK. JUST A CUT IN AND OF

01:32:46.894 --> 01:32:48.629
ITSELF. THE PEOPLE ARE

01:32:48.696 --> 01:32:49.764
EVERYONE'S AGAINST THE CUT AND

01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:51.198
I GUESS PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TWO

01:32:51.265 --> 01:32:52.366
REASONS I DON'T LIKE THE CATS

01:32:52.433 --> 01:32:55.169
ONE. THEY KNOW IT'S CAN IMPACT

01:32:55.236 --> 01:32:58.272
A PERSON. AT YOU KNOW FIFTIES.

01:32:58.339 --> 01:32:58.839
THOUSAND TEACHERS LOSE THEIR

01:32:58.906 --> 01:33:00.441
JOBSAND THE KERR MAY REVISE A

01:33:00.508 --> 01:33:02.176
PUZZLE. HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:33:02.243 --> 01:33:03.711
CLASSIFIED WORKERS FROM.

01:33:03.778 --> 01:33:04.946
CLASSMATES BUS DRIVERS

01:33:05.012 --> 01:33:06.247
CAFETERIA WORKERS THAT'S A

01:33:06.314 --> 01:33:07.181
PERSON THAT WOULD THAT WOULD

01:33:07.248 --> 01:33:08.616
PHYSICALLY LOSE THEIR JOB AND

01:33:08.683 --> 01:33:09.750
SO THAT YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WARES

01:33:09.817 --> 01:33:12.186
ON PEOPLE MAKING DECISIONS- AND

01:33:12.253 --> 01:33:12.987
THEN WE ALL BELIEVE IN THE

01:33:13.054 --> 01:33:14.522
PROGRAMS THAT THEY PROVIDE. SO

01:33:14.588 --> 01:33:15.823
WE GET THAT BUT I THINK THE

01:33:15.890 --> 01:33:18.125
BIGGER ICTURE WHAT I MENTIONED

01:33:18.192 --> 01:33:19.994
EARLIER. IS THAT. THESE CUTS

01:33:20.061 --> 01:33:20.995
DON'T JUST HAVE THOSE TWO

01:33:21.062 --> 01:33:22.797
IMPACTS THEY HAVE THE IMPACT

01:33:22.863 --> 01:33:24.732
THAT THEY WOULD. SLOW DOWN OUR

01:33:24.799 --> 01:33:26.400
ABILITY TO TURN THE ECONOMY

01:33:26.467 --> 01:33:28.602
BACK ON BECAUSE- YOU KNOW MY

01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:31.372
FAMILY. FAMILIES ALL ACROSS

01:33:31.439 --> 01:33:33.374
ACKERMAN AND CALIFORNIA.SCHOOL

01:33:33.441 --> 01:33:35.309
AND CHILD CARE DEPEND ON PEOPLE

01:33:35.376 --> 01:33:36.177
GOING BACK TO WORK PEOPLE

01:33:36.243 --> 01:33:38.279
PARENTS ARE LITTLE A STRADDLED.

01:33:38.346 --> 01:33:39.613
IN THEIR HOMES BECAUSE THEY

01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:40.715
NEED TO BE. CHILD CARE

01:33:40.781 --> 01:33:42.350
PROVIDERS NEED TO BE THE HOME

01:33:42.416 --> 01:33:43.985
SCHOOL TEACHER. AND HOW DO

01:33:44.051 --> 01:33:45.519
PEOPLE GET BACK AT IT HOW DO WE

01:33:45.586 --> 01:33:47.254
TURN OUR ECONOMY BACK ON WITH

01:33:47.321 --> 01:33:48.889
SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE WORKING

01:33:48.956 --> 01:33:51.592
COHORT. AGE YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO

01:33:51.659 --> 01:33:52.126
ARE IN THEIR PRIME WORKING

01:33:52.193 --> 01:33:54.095
YEARS. A LOT OF THEM WE NOW

01:33:54.161 --> 01:33:55.830
HAVE CHILDREN SIX MILLION

01:33:55.896 --> 01:33:56.764
CALIFORNIA KIDS IN PUBLIC

01:33:56.831 --> 01:33:58.933
SCHOOLS. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

01:33:59.000 --> 01:33:59.900
IN OUR CHILD CARE PROGRAMS AND

01:33:59.967 --> 01:34:01.902
SO. IF WE DON'T ACKNOWLEDGE

01:34:01.969 --> 01:34:03.738
THAT WE CAN'T TURN THAT LIGHT

01:34:03.804 --> 01:34:06.407
SWITCH BACK ON- TO THE ECONOMY

01:34:06.474 --> 01:34:09.076
SO. THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT EASY TO

01:34:09.143 --> 01:34:11.078
DO THE DEFERRALS. BUT WHAT'S

01:34:11.145 --> 01:34:12.680
THE ALTERNATIVE GET GET AN

01:34:12.747 --> 01:34:14.181
AWARD PAT ON THE BACK FOR THE

01:34:14.248 --> 01:34:16.851
AUSTERITY BUDGET. AND SHUT DOWN

01:34:16.917 --> 01:34:18.285
SCHOOLS IN CHILD CARE CENTERS.

01:34:18.352 --> 01:34:19.787
THAT'S NOT GONNA HELP. TURN THE

01:34:19.854 --> 01:34:21.789
ECONOMY BACK ON SO I THINK YOU

01:34:21.856 --> 01:34:24.058

01:34:45.212 --> 01:34:47.348
THAT THE CONCLUSION IS. WE'RE

01:34:47.415 --> 01:34:49.316

01:39:06.707 --> 01:39:08.475
LITTLE BIT TO HIGHER EDUCATION

01:39:08.542 --> 01:39:10.544
AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. IT WILL

01:39:10.611 --> 01:39:12.012
BE PUT TO. THE WILL THE THEY

01:39:12.079 --> 01:39:13.781
MAY REVISE I THINK HAD REALLY

01:39:13.847 --> 01:39:15.916
TOUGH CHOICES FOR AT ALL

01:39:15.983 --> 01:39:17.718
EVERYBODY AND THOSE TRIGGERS

01:39:17.785 --> 01:39:19.153
WOULD HAVE BEEN. DISASTROUS FOR

01:39:19.219 --> 01:39:20.554
SCHOOLS EARLY AT HIGHER AND

01:39:20.621 --> 01:39:22.256
COMMITTEE CALL JUST. I THINK

01:39:22.323 --> 01:39:24.158
THAT WE'RE VERY PLEASED ABOUT

01:39:24.224 --> 01:39:25.592
THE OBVIOUSLY WE EMBRACE IT

01:39:25.659 --> 01:39:27.027
TODAY THE ASSEMBLY SENATE

01:39:27.094 --> 01:39:28.896
PACKAGE- THE ONE THAT WE

01:39:28.962 --> 01:39:31.365
WEREN'T ABLE TO FIND- ENOUGH

01:39:31.432 --> 01:39:33.801
RESOURCES TO. IT IN MY IN MY

01:39:33.867 --> 01:39:34.735
OPINION IS OUR COMMUNITY

01:39:34.802 --> 01:39:36.070
COLLEGES ASSUMING THAT WE'RE

01:39:36.136 --> 01:39:38.005
TRYING TO ACKNOWLEDGE. AND

01:39:38.072 --> 01:39:39.006
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

01:39:39.073 --> 01:39:41.108
WE MADE THAT THE CHOICE AND

01:39:41.175 --> 01:39:43.711
IT'S YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE- MAY

01:39:43.777 --> 01:39:44.878
NOT LIKE IT BUT I THINK THE

01:39:44.945 --> 01:39:46.480
MAJORITY LEGISLATURE BIPARTISAN

01:39:46.547 --> 01:39:48.682
THOUGHT IT WAS THE RIGHT CALL.

01:39:48.749 --> 01:39:51.285
TO ELIMINATE THE EXPERIMENT OF

01:39:51.352 --> 01:39:54.488
CALIBRATE- WE'VE ALLOCATE LAST

01:39:54.555 --> 01:39:56.090
TWO BUDGETS OVER TWO HUNDRED

01:39:56.156 --> 01:39:57.925
MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING AND

01:39:57.991 --> 01:40:01.095
ONE TIME. TO SERVE. UP SEVENTY

01:40:01.161 --> 01:40:02.563
FIVE STUDENTS TO HAVE YOU KNOW.

01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:05.032
EXECUTIVES WITH ALMOST THAT WAY

01:40:05.099 --> 01:40:06.233
MORE SALARY IN THE GOVERNOR I'M

01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:07.501
NOT SURE HOW MUCH IT IS MAYBE

01:40:07.568 --> 01:40:10.104
ALMOST ON- POTENTIALLY DOUBLE

01:40:10.170 --> 01:40:11.638
WHAT ARE GOVERNOR MAKES. TO

01:40:11.705 --> 01:40:13.474
SERVE SEVENTY FIVE STUDENTS AND

01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:15.075
SO SERVING SEVENTY FIVE

01:40:15.142 --> 01:40:16.643
STUDENTS OR SERVING TWO POINT

01:40:16.710 --> 01:40:17.344
ONE MILLION WE THINK OUR

01:40:17.411 --> 01:40:19.079
PRIORITIES WE SHOULD PROP UP.

01:40:19.146 --> 01:40:20.881
HELPING THE TWO POINT ONE.

01:40:20.948 --> 01:40:22.349
MILLION STUDENTS WHO ARE ALL

01:40:22.416 --> 01:40:24.118
DOING ONLINE RIGHT NOW SO WE

01:40:24.184 --> 01:40:25.152
THOUGHT THT WAS THE RIGHT

01:40:25.219 --> 01:40:27.755
CALL. TO HELP THAT WITH THOSE

01:40:27.821 --> 01:40:29.189
EXISTING STUDENTS AND PROP UP

01:40:29.256 --> 01:40:32.025
THE ONLINE- PROGRAM WE HAVE FOR

01:40:32.092 --> 01:40:32.893
EXISTING COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:35.462
SYSTEM AND SO- WHEN TO MAKE

01:40:35.529 --> 01:40:39.133
SURE THAT WE BE- CAN PUT THAT

01:40:39.199 --> 01:40:40.934
ON THE RECORD TODAY. LASTLY I

01:40:41.001 --> 01:40:43.203
JUST WANTED TO LAY OUT. AND

01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:45.305
THEN ASK YOU- YOUR YOUR YOUR

01:40:45.372 --> 01:40:46.974
THOUGHTS I KNOWING YOU'RE

01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:48.809
NEGOTIATING RIGHT NOW WITH OUR

01:40:48.876 --> 01:40:50.377
WITH OUR LEADERSHIP FROM THE

01:40:50.444 --> 01:40:51.712
SPEAKER IN THE PRO TEM ON THE

01:40:51.779 --> 01:40:54.214
CELL- I WANT TO RESPECT THAT

01:40:54.281 --> 01:40:57.217
PROCESS. BUT WE IN THE

01:40:57.284 --> 01:40:59.586
LEGISLATURE- RELATE TO EARLY

01:40:59.653 --> 01:41:01.054
EDUCATION LIKE I SAID EARLIER

01:41:01.121 --> 01:41:02.723
WE REALIZE IT'S NOT JUST

01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:03.791
IMPORTANT NOT JUST IMPORTANT

01:41:03.857 --> 01:41:05.893
THAT THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF A

01:41:05.959 --> 01:41:07.461
CHILD'S BRAIN AND HELPING

01:41:07.528 --> 01:41:09.630
PARENTS GO TO WORK AND BEING AN

01:41:09.696 --> 01:41:11.231
ANTI POVERTY PROGRAM AND ALL

01:41:11.298 --> 01:41:12.766
THE REASONS WE SUPPORT EARLY

01:41:12.833 --> 01:41:13.934
AND WHAT REALLY MATTERS BUT WE

01:41:14.001 --> 01:41:16.003
THINK. IT'S SO KEY FOR PEOPLE

01:41:16.069 --> 01:41:18.705
TO GET BACK TO WORK AND SO WE

01:41:18.772 --> 01:41:20.507
COULDN'T STOP- A PICKUP

01:41:20.574 --> 01:41:22.276
APPROVED REGARDLESS OF TRIGGER

01:41:22.342 --> 01:41:24.645
Nó TRIGGER THOSE CUTS TO CHILD

01:41:24.711 --> 01:41:25.946
CARE IN FULL DAY PRE SCHOOL

01:41:26.013 --> 01:41:27.181
PROGRAMS THAT THEY'RE BARELY

01:41:27.247 --> 01:41:29.850
AFLOAT NOW BEFORE THAT PANDEMIC

01:41:29.917 --> 01:41:32.252
AND- THE FINANCIALLY DON'T

01:41:32.319 --> 01:41:33.220
CANCEL OUT AND SELL THAT WOULD

01:41:33.287 --> 01:41:35.422
JUST BE- YOU KNOW THE DEATH

01:41:35.489 --> 01:41:36.190
SENTENCE TO SOME OF THOSE

01:41:36.256 --> 01:41:37.458
PROGRAMS AND JUST FURTHER

01:41:37.524 --> 01:41:39.426
HAMPER OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY-

01:41:39.493 --> 01:41:41.195
WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THERE'S

01:41:41.261 --> 01:41:43.697
GOING TO BE IN NEXT- HEROES

01:41:43.764 --> 01:41:44.665
BACK AT THE CONGRESSIONAL

01:41:44.731 --> 01:41:47.401
LEVEL. AND ONE THING THAT AS

01:41:47.468 --> 01:41:49.670
BEEN BIPARTISAN SO FAR IS EARLY

01:41:49.736 --> 01:41:50.637
EDUCATION FROM THE

01:41:50.704 --> 01:41:52.306
CONGRESSIONAL LEVEL FROM

01:41:52.372 --> 01:41:53.474
REPUBLICANS FROM THE WHITE

01:41:53.540 --> 01:41:56.043
HOUSE IN DID DEMOCRATS AS WELL

01:41:56.109 --> 01:41:58.378
AND SO ONE THING THAT WE WANT

01:41:58.445 --> 01:41:59.947
TO DO IS TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN

01:42:00.013 --> 01:42:02.216
PRE PROGRAM NOT IN FOCUS ON

01:42:02.282 --> 01:42:04.017
ACCESS NOT JUST KEEPING A FLOW

01:42:04.084 --> 01:42:05.919
BUT HOW DO WE SERVE. MORE

01:42:05.986 --> 01:42:07.788
PEOPLE WHO ARE IS TO WORKERS

01:42:07.855 --> 01:42:10.224
AND YOU KNOW PRETTY MUCH THE

01:42:10.290 --> 01:42:11.058
PEOPLE WHO GO TO THE STATE

01:42:11.124 --> 01:42:12.793
FUNDED CHILDCARE PROGRAMS. OVER

01:42:12.860 --> 01:42:15.529
I THINK TO ARE BY DEAF THE

01:42:15.596 --> 01:42:16.597
SENSE OF WORKERS EITHER IN

01:42:16.663 --> 01:42:18.098
HEALTH CARE OR THAT SERVICE

01:42:18.165 --> 01:42:19.900
FIELD AND YOU KNOW THERE'S A

01:42:19.967 --> 01:42:22.803
HUGE NEED. AND SO AS FAR AS-

01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:24.938
ACCESS AND SLOTS AND-

01:42:25.005 --> 01:42:26.473
STABILIZING THE RATES TO MAKE

01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:28.475
SURE THEY ACTUALLY- CANCEL OUT

01:42:28.542 --> 01:42:30.210
AND CAN STAY AFLOAT FINANCIALLY

01:42:30.277 --> 01:42:31.979
AND JUST OVERALL INFRASTRUCTURE

01:42:32.045 --> 01:42:34.948
SO- WE PUT FOR THAT A PROPOSAL

01:42:35.015 --> 01:42:37.017
IN OUR PLAN AND YOU KNOW WE

01:42:37.084 --> 01:42:38.785
THINK THAT IT IS NOT JUST RIGHT

01:42:38.852 --> 01:42:40.654
FOR THE MORAL REASONS BUT RIGHT

01:42:40.721 --> 01:42:44.057
FOR OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY. AND

01:42:44.124 --> 01:42:45.225
WANTED TO ASK YOU IF YOU HAD

01:42:45.292 --> 01:42:46.927
INITIAL THOUGHTS ON THAT. YEAH

01:42:46.994 --> 01:42:48.529
I'LL SAY VERY BRIEFLY- AND I

01:42:48.595 --> 01:42:49.730
KNOW JUST ON THE LINE AS WELL

01:42:49.796 --> 01:42:52.165
THAT THAT GOVERNOR SHARES OF

01:42:52.232 --> 01:42:53.267
COURSE SO MANY OF THE ARGUMENTS

01:42:53.333 --> 01:42:55.536
THAT YOU JUST MADE AND ONE

01:42:55.602 --> 01:42:56.136
THING YOU MADE IN PARTICULAR

01:42:56.203 --> 01:42:57.471
ABOUT FEDERAL FUNDING IS IN

01:42:57.538 --> 01:42:59.473
ADDITION. TO THE FLEXIBLE

01:42:59.540 --> 01:43:01.708
RELIEF THAT WE ARE ALL HOPING

01:43:01.775 --> 01:43:03.243
FOR AT THE GOVERNOR IS ALSO

01:43:03.310 --> 01:43:04.945
APPRECIATED THE EXTRA FUNDING

01:43:05.012 --> 01:43:05.746
FOR THE CHILD CARE DEVELOPMENT

01:43:05.812 --> 01:43:06.914
BLOCK GRANT THAT CONGRESS

01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:08.549
PROVIDED AND WE'RE HOPING FOR

01:43:08.615 --> 01:43:10.350
MORE SPECIFICALLY IN THAT AREA

01:43:10.417 --> 01:43:12.519
AS WELL- WHEN IT COMES ARE

01:43:12.586 --> 01:43:14.621
SPECIFICALLY TO THE CUTS ARE IN

01:43:14.688 --> 01:43:15.722
THE NAY REVISION COMPARED TO

01:43:15.789 --> 01:43:17.190
THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE. I KNOW

01:43:17.257 --> 01:43:20.260
THERE WILL BE MORE TO SAY ABOUT

01:43:20.327 --> 01:43:20.827
HOW TO RESOLVE THOSE IN THE

01:43:20.894 --> 01:43:22.062
NEXT COUPLE DAYS. OKAY THANK

01:43:22.129 --> 01:43:29.570
YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR RENTAL.

01:43:29.636 --> 01:43:31.872
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND AS I

01:43:31.939 --> 01:43:34.908
BEGAN I WANT TO START WHERE-

01:43:34.975 --> 01:43:37.477
OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO-

01:43:37.544 --> 01:43:40.247
WAS WHICH WAS THAT WE WERE NOT

01:43:40.314 --> 01:43:40.981
PRESENT DURING THE LAST%

01:43:41.048 --> 01:43:43.016
RECESSION. AND I THINK MANY OF

01:43:43.083 --> 01:43:46.119
US HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND LOOK

01:43:46.186 --> 01:43:48.989
TO OUR PREDECESSORS TO FIGURE

01:43:49.056 --> 01:43:50.190
OUT IF THERE ARE SOME LESSONS

01:43:50.257 --> 01:43:52.626
TO BE LEARNED. AND IF WE DON'T

01:43:52.693 --> 01:43:54.628
STAND. AS WE'VE LEARNED FROM

01:43:54.695 --> 01:43:56.697
HISTORY THOSE WHO DO NOT ARE

01:43:56.763 --> 01:43:59.166
DOOMED TO REPEAT IT. AND I WANT

01:43:59.232 --> 01:44:01.568
TO ASK YOU TWO QUESTIONS MR

01:44:01.635 --> 01:44:04.171
THIS ONE EVEN IF I CAN'T. FIRST

01:44:04.237 --> 01:44:06.740
CAN YOU HELP ME TO DEFINE WHAT

01:44:06.807 --> 01:44:09.142
SUBSIDIARITY MEETINGS WHAT DOES

01:44:09.209 --> 01:44:10.777
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:44:10.844 --> 01:44:14.047
CATEGORIZE IT AS- SO THAT WAS

01:44:14.114 --> 01:44:16.183
THE TERM- THAT WAS USED OFTEN

01:44:16.249 --> 01:44:18.986
BY GOVERNOR BROWN- SO I DON'T

01:44:19.052 --> 01:44:20.220
WANT TO SPEAK FOR A GOVERNOR

01:44:20.287 --> 01:44:22.356
BROWN- BUT MY RECOLLECTION IS

01:44:22.422 --> 01:44:24.291
THAT. IT REFERS TO- GIVING

01:44:24.358 --> 01:44:27.027
GREATER RESPONSIBILITY TO

01:44:27.094 --> 01:44:27.594
JURISDICTIONS LOCALLY ON THE

01:44:27.661 --> 01:44:31.331
GROUND. SO IF I CAN I. THINK

01:44:31.398 --> 01:44:32.265
IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT

01:44:32.332 --> 01:44:33.467
SUBSIDIARITY HAS NOT BEEN

01:44:33.533 --> 01:44:36.670
PERFECT. AND I WOULD USE AS AN

01:44:36.737 --> 01:44:39.339
EXAMPLE OF THE FACT THAT IN

01:44:39.406 --> 01:44:41.675
NINETEEN NINETY ONE AND IN

01:44:41.742 --> 01:44:42.275
TWENTY ELEVEN WE'VE HAD TO DO

01:44:42.342 --> 01:44:45.112
REALIGNMENT. AND SO I THANK MY

01:44:45.178 --> 01:44:46.380
QUESTION FOR YOU MY FINAL

01:44:46.446 --> 01:44:47.814
QUESTION AND I'M SORRY FOR

01:44:47.881 --> 01:44:50.450
BEING SO POINTED. IS THAT GIVEN

01:44:50.517 --> 01:44:52.152
THE FISCAL CONSTRAINTS THAT ARE

01:44:52.219 --> 01:44:54.488
COUNTIES NOW FACE. IS THE

01:44:54.554 --> 01:44:56.223
ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERING

01:44:56.289 --> 01:44:58.325
DISCUSSIONS WITH COUNTIES ON

01:44:58.392 --> 01:45:00.694
HOW BEST TO REALIGN PROGRAMS

01:45:00.761 --> 01:45:03.497
AND FUNDING TO BETTER PROTECT

01:45:03.563 --> 01:45:05.565
OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS

01:45:05.632 --> 01:45:07.868
AND TO BETTER REFLECT OUR

01:45:07.934 --> 01:45:10.337
CALIFORNIA VALLEY'S. ON THE

01:45:10.404 --> 01:45:12.873
QUESTION I WILL SAY NUMBER ONE

01:45:12.939 --> 01:45:14.474
IT JUST AS WITH THE LEGISLATURE

01:45:14.541 --> 01:45:16.009
WERE IN TOUCH WITH COUNTIES AND

01:45:16.076 --> 01:45:17.044
CITIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:45:17.110 --> 01:45:18.879
AND ALL THESE ISSUES ESPECIALLY

01:45:18.945 --> 01:45:20.580
NOW GIVEN THE STRESS THAT

01:45:20.647 --> 01:45:22.282
THEY'RE UNDER AND WE APPRECIATE

01:45:22.349 --> 01:45:23.884
THAT STRESS AND- WE KNOW IT'S

01:45:23.950 --> 01:45:25.552
EASY TO LOOK AT OUR OWN YOU

01:45:25.619 --> 01:45:26.787
KNOW FIFTY FOUR POINT THREE

01:45:26.853 --> 01:45:27.654
BILLION DOLLAR BUDGETGAP BUT

01:45:27.721 --> 01:45:29.756
WE UNDERSTAND THOSE. STRESSES

01:45:29.823 --> 01:45:30.557
THAT THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

01:45:30.624 --> 01:45:33.026
ARE FACING SECOND- SPECIFICALLY

01:45:33.093 --> 01:45:34.895
WHEN IT COMES TO COUNTIES THE

01:45:34.961 --> 01:45:36.897
NAY REVISION INCLUDED ONE POINT

01:45:36.963 --> 01:45:37.931
THREE BILLION DOLLARS OF THE

01:45:37.998 --> 01:45:40.267
FEDERAL ALLOCATION TO HELP-

01:45:40.333 --> 01:45:41.568
COUNTY- HEALTH AND SOCIAL

01:45:41.635 --> 01:45:43.503
SERVICES AND SO WE UNDERSTAND

01:45:43.570 --> 01:45:44.604
THAT THAT ALLOCATION IS NOT

01:45:44.671 --> 01:45:46.206
SUFFICIENT TO ALLEVIATE. ALL

01:45:46.273 --> 01:45:47.908
THE STRESSES- THAT- THOSE

01:45:47.974 --> 01:45:49.876
JURISDICTIONS ARE FACING- WE

01:45:49.943 --> 01:45:51.078
ALSO KNOW FROM THE LEGISLATIVE

01:45:51.144 --> 01:45:52.379
PACKAGE THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS

HAS A MIXTURE OF ENTITLEMENT

01:47:39.452 --> 01:47:41.221
PROGRAMS AND NON ENTITLEMENT

01:47:41.288 --> 01:47:43.590

01:47:43.657 --> 01:47:45.458
LIKELY WILL HAVE TO PRIORITIZE

01:47:45.525 --> 01:47:47.761

HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY IN THEM.

01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:56.870
BUT NOW THAT SAID SOME OF THE

01:47:56.937 --> 01:47:58.138
PROGRAMS OVER WHICH COUNTIES

01:47:58.205 --> 01:47:59.606

TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL

01:48:05.412 --> 01:48:07.447

01:48:07.514 --> 01:48:08.949
OF CONCERN FOR THE LEGISLATURE

01:48:09.015 --> 01:48:10.116

COUNTIES IN TERMS OF HOW THEY

01:48:17.958 --> 01:48:20.026
MIGHT PLAN TO GO ABOUT DEALING

01:48:20.093 --> 01:48:21.828
WITH THE REDUCTIONS IN REVENUE.

01:48:21.895 --> 01:48:23.163
ABOUT LIKELY AS I MENTIONED

01:48:23.230 --> 01:48:25.098

RESPONSES- OVER THE NEXT YEAR

01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:29.069
OR SO. AND I REALLY DO

01:48:29.135 --> 01:48:30.337

01:48:30.403 --> 01:48:32.639
YOU'VE HIT- RIGHT ON THE NAIL

01:48:32.706 --> 01:48:35.308

BE MOST AT RISK WHETHER OR NOT

01:48:38.812 --> 01:48:40.347

01:48:40.413 --> 01:48:42.649
SERVICES OR- ADULT PROTECTIVE

01:48:42.716 --> 01:48:44.451
SERVICES I THINK WE NEED TO

01:48:44.517 --> 01:48:46.253
ACKNOWLEDGE AND TO KNOW AS A

01:48:46.319 --> 01:48:48.655
LEGISLATIVE BODY- WHO WHAT.

01:48:48.722 --> 01:48:51.124
THOSE POTENTIAL CUTS ARE ON THE

01:48:51.191 --> 01:48:52.826
TABLE BY THE FIFTY DIFFERENT

01:48:52.893 --> 01:48:55.161
COUNTIES. NOW IF I CAN SAY

01:48:55.228 --> 01:48:57.264
DURING THE LAST RECESSION I

01:48:57.330 --> 01:48:58.665
THOUGHT THERE REALLY WAS A

01:48:58.732 --> 01:49:01.334
TRAGIC CHANGE. THAT WE MADE ONE

01:49:01.401 --> 01:49:03.236
THAT I HOPE WE CAN IMPROVE UPON

01:49:03.303 --> 01:49:05.805
NOW TO OUR CAL WORKS TIME

01:49:05.872 --> 01:49:07.507
CLOCKS. AND IN MANY COUNTIES

01:49:07.574 --> 01:49:09.910
INCLUDING- THE DISTRICT THAT I

01:49:09.976 --> 01:49:12.345
REPRESENT. WHICH WERE SOME OF

01:49:12.412 --> 01:49:13.680
THOSE WHICH WERE HARDEST HIT

01:49:13.747 --> 01:49:15.282
AND STILL HAVE YET TO QUITE

01:49:15.348 --> 01:49:17.684
RECOVER. MY FEAR IS THAT MANY

01:49:17.751 --> 01:49:19.019
OF THE POLICIES THAT WE STILL

01:49:19.085 --> 01:49:21.788

01:49:21.855 --> 01:49:23.256
DISPARITIES THAT WE SEE WITHIN

01:49:23.323 --> 01:49:25.425
OUR COMMUNITIES. AND SO MY NEXT

01:49:25.492 --> 01:49:27.294
QUESTION FOR THE LA- IF I CAN

01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:29.062

THERE'VE BEEN A NUMBER OF

01:49:45.645 --> 01:49:47.180
STUDIES THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S

01:49:47.247 --> 01:49:48.381

01:53:02.709 --> 01:53:03.776
WANT TO THANK THOSE WHO WORKED

01:53:03.843 --> 01:53:05.745
VERY HARD ON THIS BUDGET YOU

01:53:05.812 --> 01:53:08.481
KNOW THAT WE FINALLY ARRIVED AT.

01:53:08.548 --> 01:53:09.883
ROUGHLY A BETTER CONCLUSION

01:53:09.949 --> 01:53:11.151
THAT WOULD START WITH THE FORD

01:53:11.217 --> 01:53:12.485
SO IT MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT

01:53:12.552 --> 01:53:13.253
BETTER A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:53:13.319 --> 01:53:15.688
PALATABLE ARE STILL ASKING A

01:53:15.755 --> 01:53:16.756
LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT WE NEED

01:53:16.823 --> 01:53:20.126
TO ASK- JUST WANTED TO- IN

01:53:20.193 --> 01:53:22.295
DELVING A LITTLE BIT INTO THE-

01:53:22.362 --> 01:53:24.898
UNIVERSITY FUNDING AND- LOOKING

01:53:24.964 --> 01:53:25.498

PROFESSOR. WELL THE LAST TIME%

01:53:33.173 --> 01:53:34.607
WHEN WE WERE ENGAGED IN

01:53:34.674 --> 01:53:36.743
SOMETHING LIKE THIS- AS WE WERE

01:53:36.809 --> 01:53:39.479
CUTTING- POSITIONS DOING FOR

01:53:39.546 --> 01:53:41.181
LITTLE SWITCHING ARRANGEMENTS.

WAY MONEY FOR OTHER THINGS AND

01:53:44.984 --> 01:53:46.119
THEN WE FOUND OUT RECENTLY OF

01:53:46.186 --> 01:53:47.921
COURSE THAT THEY HAD OVER

01:53:47.987 --> 01:53:49.689
BILLION DOLLARS THAT THEY HAD

01:53:55.461 --> 01:53:57.163
INCREASES EXPERIENCING

01:53:57.230 --> 01:53:58.898
FURLOUGHS 10% CUTS IN THEIR

THESE FUNDS THAT HAD BEEN REYES

01:54:04.237 --> 01:54:06.873
NOT NECESSARILY- IN THE BEST

01:54:06.940 --> 01:54:08.408
WAY ARE WE REQUIRE THAT THEY

01:54:08.474 --> 01:54:10.176
UTILIZE THOSE FUNDS AT THIS

01:54:10.243 --> 01:54:12.145
TIME THE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:54:12.212 --> 01:54:13.980

THE PHONE AND HE'LL BE ABLE TO

01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:24.958
SPEAK IN DETAIL TO THE NATION.

01:54:25.024 --> 01:54:25.825
YEAH CHRIS SERVICE FROM THE

01:54:25.892 --> 01:54:27.627
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SO OUR

01:54:27.694 --> 01:54:31.364
PROPOSAL TO GO LOCAL FIRE THEM

01:54:31.431 --> 01:54:32.599
TO A REQUIRED TO SEGMENT THAT

01:54:32.665 --> 01:54:34.434
IT'S TO UTILIZE THEIR-

01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:37.036
RESEARCH- FOR THE PURPOSES YOU

01:54:37.103 --> 01:54:39.105
NOTED. HOWEVER UNDER THE

01:54:39.172 --> 01:54:41.274
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. IT

01:54:41.341 --> 01:54:43.876
IS ASSUMED THAT BOWL THE UC AND

01:54:43.943 --> 01:54:46.379
SEE IF SHE WOULD NEED TO- USED

01:54:46.446 --> 01:54:47.513
AS WELL OF THE COMMUNITY

01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:49.749
COLLEGES WOULD NEED TO. TAP

01:54:49.816 --> 01:54:54.520
INTO THEIR RESERVES TO. SUSTAIN

01:54:54.587 --> 01:54:55.622
THEIR CORE OPERATIONS. BUT WHEN

01:54:55.688 --> 01:54:56.556
REQUIRING WHICH MEANS THEY

01:54:56.623 --> 01:54:59.025
COULD DO IT SOME OF THEM DID

01:54:59.092 --> 01:54:59.659
AND THAT WAS TO INCREASE

01:54:59.726 --> 01:55:02.028
STUDENT FEES- NOT ONLY WITH A

01:55:02.095 --> 01:55:04.063
PARKING FEES BUT OTHER STUDENTS

01:55:04.130 --> 01:55:05.865
SUPPOSEDLY ACADEMIC FEES.

01:55:05.932 --> 01:55:08.401
AROUND THE SYSTEM AS A RESULT

01:55:08.468 --> 01:55:09.402
WERE ABLE TO STOCKPILE THESE

01:55:09.469 --> 01:55:11.671
RESOURCES- WHILE THEY WERE OF

01:55:11.738 --> 01:55:13.206
SUPPOSEDLY CUTTING PROGRAMS AND

01:55:13.273 --> 01:55:15.642
CUTTING SALARIES- I JUST THINK

01:55:15.708 --> 01:55:17.844
THAT- IF WE IF WE'RE HONEST

01:55:17.910 --> 01:55:18.911
ABOUT IT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

01:55:18.978 --> 01:55:20.480
THAT WE CAREFULLY WATCH THAT

01:55:20.546 --> 01:55:22.282
THAT'S AN ONGOING CONCERN. WE

01:55:22.348 --> 01:55:23.983
PASS LEGISLATION THAT THOUGH

01:55:24.050 --> 01:55:26.286
SUPPOSEDLY DOES NOT ALLOW THEM

01:55:26.352 --> 01:55:27.587
TO RAISE FEES WITHOUT STUDENT

01:55:27.654 --> 01:55:29.422
INPUT AND MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

01:55:29.489 --> 01:55:30.523
I GOT FROM SOMEONE THE OTHER

01:55:30.590 --> 01:55:31.958
DAY IS OUR CAMPUSES ARE STILL

01:55:32.025 --> 01:55:32.825
DOING IT DESPITE THE

01:55:32.892 --> 01:55:35.528
LEGISLATION. AND SO WE HAVE TO

01:55:35.595 --> 01:55:36.029
MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE

01:55:36.095 --> 01:55:38.164
OVERSIGHT ON THAT WE KNOW THAT

01:55:38.231 --> 01:55:39.499
TIMES ARE HARD BUT AT THE SAME

01:55:39.565 --> 01:55:41.067
TIME IT'S ALSO HARD ON OUR

01:55:41.134 --> 01:55:42.702
EMPLOYEES AND SO WE WANT TO

01:55:42.769 --> 01:55:44.003
MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T

01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:45.305
HAPPEN THAT THAT HAPPENS IN A

01:55:45.371 --> 01:55:46.439
DIFFERENT WAY. SO THAT THEY DO

01:55:46.506 --> 01:55:49.075
DO THAT- I HOPE IT AS WE TALK

01:55:49.142 --> 01:55:50.510
WHAT EDUCATIONAL FLEXIBILITY

01:55:50.576 --> 01:55:52.812
AND THAT'S IMPORTANT- WE ARE IN

01:55:52.879 --> 01:55:54.180
A DIFFERENT PLACE THE LAST TIME

01:55:54.247 --> 01:55:56.916
WE DID- WHEN YOU HAD TO DO CUTS

01:55:56.983 --> 01:55:58.351
OF WE HAD A LOT OF CHEMICAL OR

01:55:58.418 --> 01:55:59.786
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE CATEGORY

01:55:59.852 --> 01:56:01.120
BECAUSE NOT THAT MUCH NOW. BUT

01:56:01.187 --> 01:56:02.555
I KNOW THERE'S A DESIRE FOR

01:56:02.622 --> 01:56:05.024
FLEXIBILITY- AND WHILE I

01:56:05.091 --> 01:56:06.693
GENERALLY SUPPORT FLEXIBILITY I

01:56:06.759 --> 01:56:08.261
TRY NOT TO SUPPORT IT AT THE

01:56:08.328 --> 01:56:09.996
EXPENSE OF THE POOREST KIDS IN

01:56:10.063 --> 01:56:12.065
OUR DISTRICT. AND SO I THINK WE

01:56:12.131 --> 01:56:12.765
HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE'VE SEEN

01:56:12.832 --> 01:56:15.201
THAT IN OUR- AUDIT REPORT THE

01:56:15.268 --> 01:56:16.703
USE THE MISUSE OF DOLLARS THAT

01:56:16.769 --> 01:56:18.204
SHOULD HAVE GONE TO POOR KIDS

01:56:18.271 --> 01:56:19.439
WERE ROLLED OVER TO THE NEXT

01:56:19.505 --> 01:56:21.240
YEAR WE HAVE LEGISLATION NOW.

01:56:21.307 --> 01:56:22.275
TO PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING

01:56:22.342 --> 01:56:23.576
BUT AS PEOPLE CLAMOR FOR

01:56:23.643 --> 01:56:25.278
FLEXIBILITY WE HAVE TO MAKE

01:56:25.345 --> 01:56:26.212
SURE WE KNOW WHAT THEY WANT TO

01:56:26.279 --> 01:56:28.514
BE FLEXIBLE ABOUT AN OFTENTIMES

01:56:28.581 --> 01:56:30.416
AT LEAST IN OUR DISTRICTS OF.

01:56:30.483 --> 01:56:31.984
THE POOREST FAMILIES THOUGH OF

01:56:32.051 --> 01:56:33.686
COURSE CHILDREN OF THE LEAST

01:56:33.753 --> 01:56:35.355
PERFORMING ONES BECAUSE IT

01:56:35.421 --> 01:56:36.889
CLAMOR SOUL IS SO GREAT FROM

01:56:36.956 --> 01:56:39.525
OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MORE

01:56:39.592 --> 01:56:42.095
AFFLUENT THEY END UP ALL- NOT

01:56:42.161 --> 01:56:43.830
HEARING THE VOICES OF THOSE WHO

01:56:43.896 --> 01:56:45.965
ARE BEHIND. AND I WANT TO MAKE

01:56:46.032 --> 01:56:46.899
SURE THAT WE KNOW THAT

01:56:46.966 --> 01:56:50.436
FLEXIBILITY IS NOT INCLUDE USE

01:56:50.503 --> 01:56:51.838
OF THE- SUPPLEMENTAL GRANTS AND

01:56:51.904 --> 01:56:52.605
WE'RE SATISFIED TO CLOSE THE

01:56:52.672 --> 01:56:56.876
ACHIEVEMENT GAP THAT IS A NON.

01:56:56.943 --> 01:56:57.944
NEGOTIABLE IN SHOULD BE IN THE

01:56:58.010 --> 01:56:59.112
LINE TO GIVE THEM. A NEGOTIABLE.

01:56:59.178 --> 01:57:00.179
US BECAUSE THAT JUST DAY TO DAY

01:57:00.246 --> 01:57:02.215
HOLE. AND MAKES IT HARDER FOR

01:57:02.281 --> 01:57:03.015
OUR KIDS AND OUR AND OUR- AND

01:57:03.082 --> 01:57:04.884
OUR TO ECONOMY TO REBOUND. SO I

01:57:04.951 --> 01:57:05.818
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IS CLEAR

01:57:05.885 --> 01:57:06.853
BECAUSE IT SOUNDS GOOD ON THE

01:57:06.919 --> 01:57:07.854
SURFACE THAT THE ONE

01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:09.655
FLEXIBILITY- BUT WE KNOW WHAT

01:57:09.722 --> 01:57:10.923
HAPPENED. WHEN THEY HAD ALL THE

01:57:10.990 --> 01:57:12.692
FLEXIBILITY AND IN GOOD TIMES.

01:57:12.759 --> 01:57:13.993
THEY DID NOT DID THEY USED

01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:15.862
WELL. I KNOW IN MY COUNTY AND

01:57:15.928 --> 01:57:18.531
IN ANOTHER. TWO DISTRICTS- OVER

01:57:18.598 --> 01:57:19.632
THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

01:57:19.699 --> 01:57:21.134
WERE.WERE ROLLED OVER TO BE

01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:23.102
USED TO OF THE FOR PENSIONS AND

01:57:23.169 --> 01:57:24.370
A HOST OF OTHER THINGS. SO WE

01:57:24.437 --> 01:57:25.571
CAN'T AFFORD TO ALLOW THAT TO

01:57:25.638 --> 01:57:27.340
HAPPEN FOR KIDS TO. UNDERSTAND

01:57:27.407 --> 01:57:28.541
IS ABOUT SEVENTEEN BILLION

01:57:28.608 --> 01:57:29.776
DOLLARS THAT DID NOT GET TO OUR

01:57:29.842 --> 01:57:30.676
CHILDREN THAT SHOULD HAVE GOT

01:57:30.743 --> 01:57:31.944
TO OUR KIDS AND IT FIVE YEAR

01:57:32.011 --> 01:57:33.780
PERIOD. SO WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT

01:57:33.846 --> 01:57:34.747
UP WHEN WE TALK FLEXIBILITY

01:57:34.814 --> 01:57:36.382
IT'S NOT ABOUT FLEXIBILITY ON

01:57:36.449 --> 01:57:37.950
THE BACK OF THE POOR. AND THOSE

01:57:38.017 --> 01:57:39.185
WHO BEHIND SO ON MAKE SURE OF

01:57:39.252 --> 01:57:40.620
THAT BECAUSE I THINK WE CAN. IT

01:57:40.686 --> 01:57:41.888
SOUNDS GOOD ON THE SURFACE BUT

01:57:41.954 --> 01:57:42.855
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOES

01:57:42.922 --> 01:57:45.792
NOT- YOU KNOWS US CDC ARE HIS

01:57:45.858 --> 01:57:47.293
IT HASN'T SUFFERED AS MANY CUTS

01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:48.494
AS EVERYBODY ELSE IN AND

01:57:48.561 --> 01:57:49.862
UNDERSTAND WHY THAT LITTLE.

01:57:49.929 --> 01:57:51.197
GENERAL PUBLIC'S FEAR OF

01:57:51.264 --> 01:57:52.365
OPENING THE GATES OF THE

01:57:52.432 --> 01:57:54.801
PRISONS. IS PRETTY. SIGNIFICANT

01:57:54.867 --> 01:57:55.935
AND AS A RESULT FOLKS ON TO

01:57:56.002 --> 01:57:57.670
MAKE SURE. THE PRISON DOORS AT

01:57:57.737 --> 01:58:01.007
THEIR- MY- MY CONCERN CONTINUES

01:58:01.073 --> 01:58:02.275
TO REMAIN THAT THINGS ARE

01:58:02.341 --> 01:58:04.043
HAPPENING DESPITE WHAT WE HAVE

01:58:04.110 --> 01:58:08.014
SAID IN. COMMITTEE THAT WE WANT

01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:09.482
TO SEE FIRST. YOU KNOW. THE

01:58:09.549 --> 01:58:10.883
YEAH I STILL PLAN TO BEGIN THE

01:58:10.950 --> 01:58:12.718
PROCESS OF. OF THE VALUE

01:58:12.785 --> 01:58:14.053
WAITING AND ALL AND SHUTTING

01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:17.056
DOWN PRISONS- AND MAYBE EVEN.

01:58:17.123 --> 01:58:18.357
ONE IN THE COMING YEAR THAT

01:58:18.424 --> 01:58:19.659
PEOPLE DON'T THE CALIFORNIA

01:58:19.725 --> 01:58:20.793
SOMETHING PRISON I FORGET WHAT

01:58:20.860 --> 01:58:22.395
IT IS IT'S A- PRIVATE PRISON.

01:58:22.462 --> 01:58:25.164
BUT I'M LOOKING AT THAT AND WE

01:58:25.231 --> 01:58:27.834
HAVE CONSISTENTLY SAID- TWO. OF

01:58:27.900 --> 01:58:29.602
YOUR OPERATION AND OTHERS.

01:58:29.669 --> 01:58:31.904
WHERE ARE THE STANDARDS BY

01:58:31.971 --> 01:58:32.905
WHICH WE CLOSE PRISONS. AND

01:58:32.972 --> 01:58:34.874
MEMBERS ARE CONCERNED BECAUSE

01:58:34.941 --> 01:58:37.076
IT CAN BECOME VERY ARBITRARY.

01:58:37.143 --> 01:58:38.478
AND WE SHOULD BE IN A POSITION

01:58:38.544 --> 01:58:40.480
WHERE WE CAN SAY. OF THESE ARE

01:58:40.546 --> 01:58:41.814
THE STANDARDS THESE ARE THE

01:58:41.881 --> 01:58:43.316
EXPECTATIONS AND THIS IS WHAT

01:58:43.382 --> 01:58:45.885
WE FOUND AND WHY WE CLOSE X.

01:58:45.952 --> 01:58:48.020
PRISON VERSES Y. PRISON. THAT

01:58:48.087 --> 01:58:49.956
IF WE CAN ARTICULATE THAT TO

01:58:50.022 --> 01:58:51.457
THE PUBLIC THEY WILL BE MORE

01:58:51.524 --> 01:58:52.725
THAN LIKELY WILLING TO ACCEPT

01:58:52.792 --> 01:58:53.860
IT RATHER THAN THING IS SOME

01:58:53.926 --> 01:58:55.361
KIND OF POLITICAL DECISION.

01:58:55.428 --> 01:58:56.729
THAT WE MADE BASED ON WHO THE

01:58:56.796 --> 01:58:58.431
MOST INFLUENTIAL MEMBER WAS IN

01:58:58.498 --> 01:58:59.999
THE ROOM WITH THE TIME. AND SO

01:59:00.066 --> 01:59:01.367
WE REALLY HAVE TO HAVE THAT

01:59:01.434 --> 01:59:03.336
FIRST AND I GET FRUSTRATED WHEN

01:59:03.402 --> 01:59:04.670
I SEE THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY

01:59:04.737 --> 01:59:06.339
WHAT WE'VE DONE FIRST- WE'RE

01:59:06.405 --> 01:59:07.773
WORKING ON IT I KEEP BEING TOLD

01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:08.508
AND THERE'S SOME THINGS

01:59:08.574 --> 01:59:09.976
FLOATING AROUND. BUT THEN I

01:59:10.042 --> 01:59:11.143
HEAR ABOUT PEOPLE MAKING

01:59:11.210 --> 01:59:12.044
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CLOSE

01:59:12.111 --> 01:59:13.846
CERTAIN PLACES AND I'M SAYING

01:59:13.913 --> 01:59:15.748
BUT DID THEY MEET THE STANDARDS

01:59:15.815 --> 01:59:16.349
THAT I HAVE THAT WE HAVE NOT

01:59:16.415 --> 01:59:18.651
SEEN. AND WEARABLE STANDARDS

01:59:18.718 --> 01:59:20.553
AND THAT AND THAT IS CRITICAL-

01:59:20.620 --> 01:59:21.988
I'M NOT SURE WHERE WE PLAN TO

01:59:22.054 --> 01:59:22.989
MAKE THOSE SAVINGS WITH S

01:59:23.055 --> 01:59:24.123
GOING TO BE IN THIS BUDGET OR

01:59:24.190 --> 01:59:25.258
THE NEXT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

01:59:25.324 --> 01:59:27.093
THIS. PROCESS FOR DOING AND

01:59:27.159 --> 01:59:28.895
THAT'S A CONCERN. WANT TO MAKE

01:59:28.961 --> 01:59:30.196
SURE SOMEONE MENTIONED THAT THE

01:59:30.263 --> 01:59:32.265
MOVEMENT OF DJJ ONCE AGAIN

01:59:32.331 --> 01:59:33.900
ANOTHER ISSUE THAT IS SO OVER

01:59:33.966 --> 01:59:36.569
YEAR OLD- AND WHAT MOST OF US

01:59:36.636 --> 01:59:37.136
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:59:37.203 --> 01:59:38.538
IDENTIFY THE PROGRAMS IN

01:59:38.604 --> 01:59:40.406
ADVANCE THAT WILL BE IN DJJ. SO

01:59:40.473 --> 01:59:41.440
WE MAKE SURE THAT THE YOUNG

01:59:41.507 --> 01:59:42.608
PEOPLE GETTING WHAT THEY

01:59:42.675 --> 01:59:46.178
DESERVE. AS WELL AS- OUR ROLE

01:59:46.245 --> 01:59:47.513
IN OVERSIGHT THAT WAS RAISED

01:59:47.580 --> 01:59:49.215
BEFORE THAT WE WANT TO ENSURE

01:59:49.282 --> 01:59:50.416
THAT AS WE MOVE THESE YOUNG

01:59:50.483 --> 01:59:51.751
PEOPLE TO THE VARIOUS COUNTIES

01:59:51.817 --> 01:59:53.252
IN PROGRAMS. THAT THEY'RE NOT

01:59:53.319 --> 01:59:54.887
WINNERS AND LOSERS YOU KNOW

01:59:54.954 --> 01:59:56.122
THEY'RE NOT COUNTIES WHERE THEY

01:59:56.188 --> 01:59:57.056
HAVE LOTS OF MONEY IN THE KIDS

01:59:57.123 --> 01:59:59.091
ARE GETTING OUT. OF A CADILLAC

01:59:59.158 --> 02:00:00.927
EDUCATION AND THEN WE'LL GO TO

02:00:00.993 --> 02:00:02.828
OTHERS AND THEY'RE DRIVING TO A

02:00:02.895 --> 02:00:05.064
BURNOUT PANTO SO WE HAVE TO

02:00:05.131 --> 02:00:06.732
MAKE SURE. THAT THERE IS

02:00:06.799 --> 02:00:08.234
OVERSIGHT ON OUR PART AND I

02:00:08.301 --> 02:00:09.802
HAVEN'T YET TO SEE WHAT WE'RE

02:00:09.869 --> 02:00:11.604
SAYING THAT EVERY EVERY KID HAS

02:00:11.671 --> 02:00:13.839
TO GET. OUR WHAT OUR OUTCOME

02:00:13.906 --> 02:00:15.741
SHOULD BE AND IF WE MOVE IT TO

02:00:15.808 --> 02:00:17.009
THE COUNTIES WHERE THE NOT THE

02:00:17.076 --> 02:00:18.210
COUNTY SO PREPARE TO RECEIVE

02:00:18.277 --> 02:00:21.814
THEM- SO- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:00:21.881 --> 02:00:23.916
DOING A LOT OF THINGS AND I AND

02:00:23.983 --> 02:00:24.517
I'M CONCERNED THAT WE HAVEN'T

02:00:24.584 --> 02:00:25.518
DONE THE PRELIMINARY WORK TO

02:00:25.585 --> 02:00:27.687
MAKE IT HAPPEN. THAT THAT COULD

02:00:27.753 --> 02:00:30.089
BE DONE SO. WHAT THANK YOU GUYS

02:00:30.156 --> 02:00:30.656
FOR THE WORK YOU'VE DONE I'M

02:00:30.723 --> 02:00:32.158
I'M GLAD THAT I JUSTICE FOLKS

02:00:32.224 --> 02:00:34.026
TONIGHT IS GOING TO BE AS HURT

02:00:34.093 --> 02:00:35.828
AS AS WE THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE.

02:00:35.895 --> 02:00:36.862
IN A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT

02:00:36.929 --> 02:00:39.231
APPEAR BUT- OF MY PERSPECTIVE

02:00:39.298 --> 02:00:41.367
FROM A CDC ARE. THE BUT THE

02:00:41.434 --> 02:00:43.536
PUBLIC SAFETY THAT WE MAKE A

02:00:43.603 --> 02:00:47.840
LOT OF RECOMMENDATIONS. AND WE

02:00:47.907 --> 02:00:48.474
DON'T DO A WHOLE LOT OF PLAN. I

02:00:48.541 --> 02:00:49.809
THE REASON. IT WAS LIKE THEY'RE

02:00:49.875 --> 02:00:50.376
EXPENDABLE PEOPLE BE. IF WE

02:00:50.443 --> 02:00:51.711
FAIL THE PROCESS. OR WILL THEY

02:00:51.777 --> 02:00:52.845
JUST WAS A BUNCH OF PRISONERS

02:00:52.912 --> 02:00:54.947
ANYWAY- RATHER THAN THINKING

02:00:55.014 --> 02:00:56.048
THAT THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT WE

02:00:56.115 --> 02:00:57.083
HAVE EVEN A GREATER

02:00:57.149 --> 02:00:58.551
RESPONSIBILITY. FOR BECAUSE

02:00:58.618 --> 02:00:59.619
THEY'RE IN THE CARE OF THE

02:00:59.685 --> 02:01:00.553
STATE WITH THE REST OF THE

02:01:00.620 --> 02:01:02.922
FOLKS AND NOT. AND WE OUGHT TO

02:01:02.989 --> 02:01:03.756
BE MUCH MORE CONSCIOUS OF THE

02:01:03.823 --> 02:01:05.992
HEALTH CARE- I'VE YET TO SEE A

02:01:06.058 --> 02:01:07.460
REALLY GOOD PLAN. THE DEALS

02:01:07.526 --> 02:01:10.563
WITH COVERT IN THE PRISONS-

02:01:10.630 --> 02:01:12.832
THAT TELLS ME THAT- THAT. THAT

02:01:12.898 --> 02:01:13.265
THEY'RE HANDLING IT

02:01:13.332 --> 02:01:14.800
EFFECTIVELY. AND THAT WOULD

02:01:14.867 --> 02:01:16.035
FLOW LIKE DON'T. THEY ARE. HAVE

02:01:16.102 --> 02:01:17.937
BEEN TESTED IN QUARANTINE IN A

02:01:18.004 --> 02:01:18.738
PUT BACK INTO THEIR

02:01:18.804 --> 02:01:20.339
COMMUNITIES. WITH SOME SAFETY.

02:01:20.406 --> 02:01:23.676
AND WE YOU KNOW. WE TILT I'M

02:01:23.743 --> 02:01:24.477
TOLD EVERYBODY'S WORKING ON

02:01:24.543 --> 02:01:25.911
THAT. IT WAS WILL MAKE IT

02:01:25.978 --> 02:01:27.079
HAPPEN. BUT IF WHAT WE'RE

02:01:27.146 --> 02:01:28.381
WORKING ON IT IT'S HAPPENING

02:01:28.447 --> 02:01:30.750
ALL AT THE SAME TIME WHICH IS

02:01:30.816 --> 02:01:31.884
REALLY KIND OF SCARY HOPE WE'LL

02:01:31.951 --> 02:01:33.519
GET SOME. A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:01:33.586 --> 02:01:34.120
STRUCTURE AND WHAT WE'RE DOING

02:01:34.186 --> 02:01:41.861
THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS CARLY.

02:01:41.927 --> 02:01:43.095
A GOOD MORNING THAT QUESTION

02:01:43.162 --> 02:01:44.296
FOR THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

02:01:44.363 --> 02:01:46.766
THERE BEEN ANY ANALYSIS OF

02:01:46.832 --> 02:01:49.869
SAVINGS FROM REFORMING- POST

02:01:49.935 --> 02:01:51.771
EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS SUCH AS-

02:01:51.837 --> 02:01:54.607
HEALTH BENEFITS I'VE HEARD-

02:01:54.674 --> 02:01:56.008
ESTIMATES THAT WE COULD SAVE

02:01:56.075 --> 02:01:58.177
BILLIONS IF WE JUST HAD- THEM

02:01:58.244 --> 02:01:59.512
STRUCTURED IN A WAY THAT WAS ON

02:01:59.578 --> 02:02:01.213
PAR WITH SOME OF OUR FRIENDS IN

02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:03.215
THE WESTERN STATES PACKED LIKE

02:02:03.282 --> 02:02:05.785
COLORADO AND OREGON IS THAT

02:02:05.851 --> 02:02:06.352
SOME OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S

02:02:06.419 --> 02:02:08.721
LOOKED AT. SO THOSE TYPES OF

02:02:08.788 --> 02:02:10.322
CHANGES ARE NOT CONTEMPLATED IN

02:02:10.389 --> 02:02:12.958
OUR MAY REVISION- THAT DATA IN

02:02:13.025 --> 02:02:14.694
ADDED AT A GENERAL LEVEL IS

02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:16.395
AVAILABLE YOU KNOW BOTH. IN

02:02:16.462 --> 02:02:17.930
SOME OF OUR DOCUMENTS AS WELL

02:02:17.997 --> 02:02:19.298
AS IN CALIFORNIA IS A

02:02:19.365 --> 02:02:20.466
COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL

02:02:20.533 --> 02:02:22.568
REPORT- BUT IN TERMS OF THE

02:02:22.635 --> 02:02:24.270
SPECIFICS- I'D HAVE TO GET BACK

02:02:24.336 --> 02:02:26.005
TO YOU ON MORE DETAILS WHAT WE

02:02:26.072 --> 02:02:29.008
HAVE AVAILABLE. I IS IF THE LA-

02:02:29.075 --> 02:02:29.608
STILL HERE IS THIS I MEAN THAT

02:02:29.675 --> 02:02:36.048
YOU'VE LOOKED AT. HELLO YES- WE

02:02:36.115 --> 02:02:37.950
HAVE WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT

02:02:38.017 --> 02:02:41.087
THAT QUESTION OVER TIME AND- IT

02:02:41.153 --> 02:02:42.555
IS VERY COMPLICATED I THINK

02:02:42.621 --> 02:02:44.890
THAT IN GENERAL THE- BENEFITS

02:02:44.957 --> 02:02:47.026
THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED. OVER

02:02:47.093 --> 02:02:50.663
TIME- YOU KNOW YOU- TYPICALLY-

02:02:50.730 --> 02:02:52.531
CHANGES TO THE BENEFIT PACKAGE

02:02:52.598 --> 02:02:55.367
WOULD. FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT

02:02:55.434 --> 02:02:56.936
THE SAFEST WAY TO APPROACH IT

02:02:57.002 --> 02:02:58.537
WOULD BE TO MAKE CHANGES TO

02:02:58.604 --> 02:03:00.372
FUTURE EMPLOYEES RATHER THAN

02:03:00.439 --> 02:03:03.109
EXISTING BENEFITS. BUT THERE IS

02:03:03.175 --> 02:03:04.276
SOME LEGAL QUESTION ABOUT HOW

02:03:04.343 --> 02:03:07.346
MUCH. THE WAY THE LEGISLATURE

02:03:07.413 --> 02:03:09.482
WOULD HAVE TO REDUCE BENEFITS

02:03:09.548 --> 02:03:11.784
PARTICULARLY FOR- EXISTING

02:03:11.851 --> 02:03:15.087
RETIREES SO- YOU KNOW IT'S

02:03:15.154 --> 02:03:16.288
SOMETHING THAT WE COULD WE

02:03:16.355 --> 02:03:17.890
COULD WORK WITH YOU YOU AND

02:03:17.957 --> 02:03:18.991
YOUR STAFF TO PROVIDE A MORE

02:03:19.058 --> 02:03:21.160
DETAILED RESPONSE IF YOU WOULD

02:03:21.227 --> 02:03:29.135
LIKE BUT- YOU KNOW. IT EIGHT.

02:03:29.201 --> 02:03:32.404
SORRY I HAD. NICE GOING TO SAY

02:03:32.471 --> 02:03:34.373
I MEAN IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A

02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:36.575
FAIRLY COMPLICATED ISSUE THAT

02:03:36.642 --> 02:03:39.178
HAS SOME- QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

02:03:39.245 --> 02:03:41.013
CONSTITUTIONALITY OF CHANGING

02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:43.382
BENEFIT LEVELS AND PARTICULARLY

02:03:43.449 --> 02:03:44.850
WITH REGARD TO HOW THE STATE

02:03:44.917 --> 02:03:46.485
HAS APPROACH TO FINDING THE

02:03:46.552 --> 02:03:49.989
BENEFIT IN RECENT YEARS- ASKING

02:03:50.055 --> 02:03:52.158
EMPLOYEES TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS

02:03:52.224 --> 02:03:54.460
TO THE BENEFIT US YOU KNOW

02:03:54.527 --> 02:03:56.061
COULD COULD SET UP A AN

02:03:56.128 --> 02:03:58.264
ARGUMENT THAT THE- BENEFIT IS

02:03:58.330 --> 02:04:00.533
MORE DIFFICULT TO CHANGE-

02:04:00.599 --> 02:04:04.804
RETROACTIVELY SO- IS FAIRLY.

02:04:04.870 --> 02:04:07.039
COMPLEX I THINK TO PUT IT

02:04:07.106 --> 02:04:10.042
BLUNTLY. SURE WELL I THINK

02:04:10.109 --> 02:04:10.810
THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE

02:04:10.876 --> 02:04:12.511
LOOKING AT- IF NOT PART OF THIS

02:04:12.578 --> 02:04:14.046
BUDGET I MEAN I EVEN IF IT'S

02:04:14.113 --> 02:04:15.581
JUST FOR ON A FORWARD GOING

02:04:15.648 --> 02:04:16.949
BASIS THERE ARE SUCH A STANCE

02:04:17.016 --> 02:04:19.518
ALL SAVINGS HERE AND I YOU KNOW

02:04:19.585 --> 02:04:20.553
THE LEVEL OF THAT WERE

02:04:20.619 --> 02:04:22.421
SUBSIDIZING RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT

02:04:22.488 --> 02:04:23.823
EVEN CLEAR HOW MUCH OF VALUE IT

02:04:23.889 --> 02:04:25.391
PROVIDES TO THE RETIREES IN

02:04:25.457 --> 02:04:27.059
TERMS OF THEI HEALTH AND WELL

02:04:27.126 --> 02:04:29.361
BEING AND FINANCIAL SECURITY-

02:04:29.428 --> 02:04:30.663
DOES MAKE ONE COMMENT ON THE

02:04:30.729 --> 02:04:32.565
ISSUE OF EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY

02:04:32.631 --> 02:04:33.999
AYE AYE AT THAT SPENDING

02:04:34.066 --> 02:04:35.401
FLEXIBILITY AYE. I AGREE

02:04:35.467 --> 02:04:37.069
ACTUALLY WITH DOCTOR WEBER AND-

02:04:37.136 --> 02:04:39.205
MISTER MCCARTY- IT IN AS MUCH

02:04:39.271 --> 02:04:42.274
AS THERE IS A DISTINCTION

02:04:42.341 --> 02:04:44.743
BETWEEN THE CONCENTRATION

02:04:44.810 --> 02:04:46.846
FUNDING FOR LCF OUT FOR WE HAVE

02:04:46.912 --> 02:04:48.180
PROVIDED A DISPROPORTIONATE

02:04:48.247 --> 02:04:50.182
SHARE OF STATE EDUCATION

02:04:50.249 --> 02:04:51.550
DOLLARS TO DISTRICTS THAT HAVE

02:04:51.617 --> 02:04:53.118
A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF

02:04:53.185 --> 02:04:55.554
UNDERSERVED STUDENTS AND IT'S-

02:04:55.621 --> 02:04:58.357
WE'VE SEEN THAT THAT FUNDING

02:04:58.424 --> 02:04:59.792
HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN TARGETED AT

02:04:59.859 --> 02:05:01.727
THE STUDENTS IT'S MEANT FOR- IT

02:05:01.794 --> 02:05:03.529
IN THE WAY THAT WILL ACTUALLY

02:05:03.596 --> 02:05:05.197
LEAD TO A CLOSING EDUCATIONAL

02:05:05.264 --> 02:05:06.498
ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AND THAT'S WHY

02:05:06.565 --> 02:05:08.067
I'VE SUPPORTED DR WEBER'S

02:05:08.133 --> 02:05:09.802
EFFORTS. TO TRY TO BRING-

02:05:09.869 --> 02:05:11.103
GREATER OVERSIGHT AND

02:05:11.170 --> 02:05:12.771
ACCOUNTABILITY THAT PROCESS

02:05:12.838 --> 02:05:13.906
THAT ON THE OTHER HAND THERE

02:05:13.973 --> 02:05:16.842
ARE SOME RESTRICTIONS OF

02:05:16.909 --> 02:05:19.211
GENERAL FLEXIBILITY THAT TO ME

02:05:19.278 --> 02:05:20.412
DON'T SEEM PARTICULARLY WELL

02:05:20.479 --> 02:05:21.847
GROUNDED WHICH I YOU KNOW

02:05:21.914 --> 02:05:23.382
MISTER MCCARTY ALLUDED TO A

02:05:23.449 --> 02:05:24.250
COUPLE OF THEM I'VE HEARD

02:05:24.316 --> 02:05:25.818
ABOUT- THE FUN DEALING WITH

02:05:25.885 --> 02:05:27.219
THAT IS BOTH SPECIAL NEEDS

02:05:27.286 --> 02:05:28.854
STUDENTS I AND STUDENTS WITH

02:05:28.921 --> 02:05:30.022
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WHERE

02:05:30.089 --> 02:05:31.657
THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS- OR EVEN

02:05:31.724 --> 02:05:33.792
POTENTIALLY DEVELOPMENT FEES-

02:05:33.859 --> 02:05:35.594
AND THAT SORT OF THING SO IF

02:05:35.661 --> 02:05:39.064
WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT THIS.

02:05:39.131 --> 02:05:41.100
THROUGH NOT JUST THE LANDS OF-

02:05:41.166 --> 02:05:42.635
YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING

02:05:42.701 --> 02:05:45.738
THAT'S BEING PROVIDED BUT ALSO-

02:05:45.804 --> 02:05:47.039
THE VALUE THAT FUNDING

02:05:47.106 --> 02:05:49.275
PROVIDES- YOU KNOW LIFTING

02:05:49.341 --> 02:05:50.542
RESTRICTIONS WHERE THEY DON'T

02:05:50.609 --> 02:05:53.178
NEED TO EXIST- IS ONE WAY THAT

02:05:53.245 --> 02:05:54.813
YOU CAN ADD VALUE I WITHOUT

02:05:54.880 --> 02:05:56.382
HAVING TO HAVE EXTRA DOLLARS

02:05:56.448 --> 02:05:58.317
AND FRANKLY I WOULD EXTEND TO

02:05:58.384 --> 02:06:01.020
THAT POINT TO A MUCH BROADER

02:06:01.086 --> 02:06:03.055
SWATH OF EDUCATION POLICY AND

02:06:03.122 --> 02:06:06.158
WE HAVE A VERY THICK EDUCATION

02:06:06.225 --> 02:06:07.226
CODE. THAT HAS A LOT OF.

02:06:07.293 --> 02:06:09.361
MANDATES ARE NOT NECESSARILY AT

02:06:09.428 --> 02:06:10.329
THAT ARE DONE ARE REALLY

02:06:10.396 --> 02:06:12.164
NECESSARY FOR DISTRICTS AND THE

02:06:12.231 --> 02:06:13.198
REASON WE KNOW THAT IS BECAUSE

02:06:13.265 --> 02:06:15.234
THERE'S A PARTICULAR. A SUBSET

02:06:15.301 --> 02:06:17.136
OF OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM

02:06:17.202 --> 02:06:18.337
THAT ISN'T SUBJECT TO A LOT OF

02:06:18.404 --> 02:06:19.471
THOSE MANDATES THE CHARTER

02:06:19.538 --> 02:06:21.273
SECTOR. SO IF WE COULD THINK

02:06:21.340 --> 02:06:22.741
ABOUT WAYS TO PROVIDE

02:06:22.808 --> 02:06:24.543
FLEXIBILITY IN THAT SENSE WHERE

02:06:24.610 --> 02:06:26.679
WE'RE NOT. HAVING SO MANY

02:06:26.745 --> 02:06:29.181
MANDATES IMPOSED ON DISTRICTS

02:06:29.248 --> 02:06:30.149
THEN THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER WAY

02:06:30.215 --> 02:06:31.350
THAT I THINK WE CAN ALLOW THEM

02:06:31.417 --> 02:06:33.185
TO DO THEIR JOB OF. OF

02:06:33.252 --> 02:06:34.320
PROMOTING STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT

02:06:34.386 --> 02:06:37.723
BETTER- I HAD A TIME WHEN WE

02:06:37.790 --> 02:06:38.324
DON'T HAVE AS MUCH FUNDING TO

02:06:38.390 --> 02:06:42.061
BRING TO THE TABLE. THANK YOU

02:06:42.127 --> 02:06:43.595
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE

02:06:43.662 --> 02:06:47.633
COMMITTEE. OKAY THEN I'M GONNA

02:06:47.700 --> 02:06:49.668
GET TO MY QUESTIONS I JUST

02:06:49.735 --> 02:06:52.705
GOING TO GO ON CAN YOU DESCRIBE

02:06:52.771 --> 02:06:54.673
THE DIFFERENCES IN STRUCTURAL

02:06:54.740 --> 02:06:56.141
DEFICITS BETWEEN THE

02:06:56.208 --> 02:06:57.710
LEGISLATURE'S PROPOSAL AND THE

02:06:57.776 --> 02:07:01.413
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL- AS A- AND

02:07:01.480 --> 02:07:03.449
ALSO WHEN WE GET THE FOURTEEN

02:07:03.515 --> 02:07:05.584
BILLION. AND WHEN WE DON'T GET

02:07:05.651 --> 02:07:10.923
THE FOURTEEN DAY. ONCE YOU. YES

02:07:10.990 --> 02:07:13.959
MISTER KING I KNOW I KNOW THAT-

02:07:14.026 --> 02:07:16.762
UNDER THE MAY REVISION AS WE

02:07:16.829 --> 02:07:19.198
FIRST LOOKED AT IT THERE WERE-

02:07:19.264 --> 02:07:21.233
STRUCTURAL DEFICITS IN THE

02:07:21.300 --> 02:07:23.268
SEVERAL BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

02:07:23.335 --> 02:07:25.070
RANGE. AND THEN THERE IS

02:07:25.137 --> 02:07:26.638
ACTUALLY SOME INCREASE IN THE

02:07:26.705 --> 02:07:29.174
FINAL YEAR OF THE MULTIPLE YOUR

02:07:29.241 --> 02:07:32.678
OUTLOOK IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE

02:07:32.745 --> 02:07:33.846
TWENTY FOUR AT THAT POINT IT

02:07:33.912 --> 02:07:37.116
WOULD INCREASE TO- AROUND

02:07:37.182 --> 02:07:38.784
SIXTEEN BILLION PARTLY BECAUSE

02:07:38.851 --> 02:07:40.986
SOME OF THE REVENUE PROVISION

02:07:41.053 --> 02:07:43.989
ANDS. WOULD HAVE DROPPED OFF BY

02:07:44.056 --> 02:07:46.325
THEN AND SOME OTHER CHANGES

02:07:46.392 --> 02:07:48.560
THAT WERE OR WERE PROPOSED IN

02:07:48.627 --> 02:07:51.030
THE MAY REVISION. I MUST SAY I

02:07:51.096 --> 02:07:53.565
DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE SEEN A

02:07:53.632 --> 02:07:57.002
MULTIPLE YEAR- I HAVE NOT SEEN

02:07:57.069 --> 02:07:59.972
A MULTIPLE YEAR OUTLOOK FOR-

02:08:00.039 --> 02:08:01.640
THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE AT THIS

02:08:01.707 --> 02:08:03.442
TIME SO I THINK THAT'S A

02:08:03.509 --> 02:08:04.643
DISCUSSION THAT YOU KNOW WE

02:08:04.710 --> 02:08:06.612
COULD CONTINUE TO HAVE WITH

02:08:06.678 --> 02:08:09.648
THAT WITH THE DATA YOU KNOW

02:08:09.715 --> 02:08:10.082
WITH SOME ADDITIONAL

02:08:10.149 --> 02:08:11.316
INFORMATION. GREAT AND THEN

02:08:11.383 --> 02:08:12.885
WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S

02:08:12.951 --> 02:08:14.787
PROPOSAL DO YOU ALSO FACTOR IN

02:08:14.853 --> 02:08:16.989
ALL THE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

02:08:17.056 --> 02:08:18.090
LAYOFFS WOULD HAVE TO DO

02:08:18.157 --> 02:08:19.591
BECAUSE OF ALL THE BUDGET CUTS

02:08:19.658 --> 02:08:21.760
IN TERMS OF TEACHERS. ON IN

02:08:21.827 --> 02:08:23.362
HEALTH POOR SERVICE CARE GIVERS

02:08:23.429 --> 02:08:24.830
PEOPLE WHO STAFF THESE ADULT

02:08:24.897 --> 02:08:28.133
DAY HEALTH CENTERS- ALL ALL THE

02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:32.204
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO- WORK THE-

02:08:32.271 --> 02:08:34.640
DDS CENTERS WHAT WAS THAT A

02:08:34.706 --> 02:08:36.508
FACTOR IN YOUR IN THE IN THE

02:08:36.575 --> 02:08:40.679
ANALYSIS THAT IS A- VERY. GOOD

02:08:40.746 --> 02:08:42.848
QUESTION AND IT REASONABLE

02:08:42.915 --> 02:08:45.350
CONCERN BUT THAT'S AND THAT IS-

02:08:45.417 --> 02:08:48.053
KIND OF A- AN EFFECTIVE THE

02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:49.521
PROPOSAL THAT WE DID NOT TAKE

02:08:49.588 --> 02:08:52.391
INTO ACCOUNT IN OUR INITIAL

02:08:52.458 --> 02:08:54.359
ANALYSIS OF THE OF THE PACKAGE.

02:08:54.426 --> 02:08:55.894
WHAT WOULD BE A FAIR ASSUMPTION

02:08:55.961 --> 02:08:57.896
THAT TERM. YOU KNOW YOU KNOW

02:08:57.963 --> 02:08:59.731
UNEMPLOYMENT CASELOAD AS WELL

02:08:59.798 --> 02:09:01.233
AS ALL THE DIFFERENT TIME ONE

02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:03.836
CASELOAD PROGRAMS WOULD. GO UP

02:09:03.902 --> 02:09:08.974
BECAUSE OF THOSE MAILS. FOR THE

02:09:09.041 --> 02:09:10.876
PEOPLE AFFECTED BY BY THAT-

02:09:10.943 --> 02:09:12.511
YEAH I THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO

02:09:12.578 --> 02:09:14.113
THINK THAT THEY MAY IN SOME

02:09:14.179 --> 02:09:17.783
CASES YES BE BE- NEEDING TO

02:09:17.850 --> 02:09:19.451
UTILIZE THOSE KIND OF SERVICES

02:09:19.518 --> 02:09:22.721
YES. GREAT THANK YOU TO JUST GO

02:09:22.788 --> 02:09:25.057
BACK TO OUR DEPARTMENT FINANCE-

02:09:25.124 --> 02:09:27.793
LOOKING AT THE FOUR BILLION

02:09:27.860 --> 02:09:29.928
DOLLAR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

02:09:29.995 --> 02:09:32.865
MEDI CAL. CAL WORKS- CASELOAD

02:09:32.931 --> 02:09:35.801
ASSUMPTIONS. BECAUSE OF THAT-

02:09:35.868 --> 02:09:37.269
BECAUSE OF THE HUGE INCREASING

02:09:37.336 --> 02:09:41.073
CASELOADS IN YOUR PROPOSAL THAT

02:09:41.140 --> 02:09:42.007
DROVE MANY OF THE BUDGET CUTS

02:09:42.074 --> 02:09:44.176
AND HUMAN SERVICES AND THE-

02:09:44.243 --> 02:09:49.014
PUBLIC HEALTH AREA SO IF THE

02:09:49.081 --> 02:09:51.984
ASSUMPTION WAS INCORRECT AND

02:09:52.050 --> 02:09:55.420
YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE- CASE LOAD.

02:09:55.487 --> 02:09:56.889
THE U. IT ANTICIPATED WHAT

02:09:56.955 --> 02:09:58.190
WOULD BE DONE WITH THE MONEY

02:09:58.257 --> 02:10:01.360
THE SAFETY. SO IF IT TURNS OUT

02:10:01.426 --> 02:10:02.761
THAT EXPENSES ARE LOWER THAN WE

02:10:02.828 --> 02:10:04.129
ARE PROJECTING THEN THAT MONEY

02:10:04.196 --> 02:10:05.931
IT CERTAINLY WOULDN'T GO AWAY

02:10:05.998 --> 02:10:08.000
IT WOULD SIMPLY- ROLLING TO THE

02:10:08.066 --> 02:10:09.334
NEXT YEAR FOR APPROPRIATION BY

02:10:09.401 --> 02:10:12.671
THE LEGISLATURE. SUSAN RESERVE.

02:10:12.738 --> 02:10:15.174
YEAH IT WOULD BE- THE- AND

02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:16.808
ASSUMING EVERYTHING ELSE WAS

02:10:16.875 --> 02:10:19.011
EXACTLY HOW WE PROJECTED IT-

02:10:19.077 --> 02:10:20.979
THE AND YOUR BALANCE- SO THE

02:10:21.046 --> 02:10:23.115
KERRY AND SURPLUS- WOULD BE

02:10:23.182 --> 02:10:24.249
THAT MUCH HIGHER BY HOWEVER

02:10:24.316 --> 02:10:26.251
MANY BILLION DOLLARS- THEN WE

02:10:26.318 --> 02:10:27.853
ARE PROJECTING. I SHOULD NOTE

02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:29.788
THOUGH AS WE ALL KNOW THAT. FOR

02:10:29.855 --> 02:10:31.390
THE YEAR AFTER THIS YEAR- WE

02:10:31.456 --> 02:10:32.925
ARE CURRENTLY PROJECTING A

02:10:32.991 --> 02:10:34.259
STRUCTURAL DEFICIT OF SEVERAL

02:10:34.326 --> 02:10:35.894
BILLION DOLLARS SO IT WOULD

02:10:35.961 --> 02:10:37.162
MORE ABOUT THE FACT IF

02:10:37.229 --> 02:10:38.063
EVERYTHING WERE TO GO WAS WE'RE

02:10:38.130 --> 02:10:40.032
PROJECTING. OF REDUCING THE

02:10:40.098 --> 02:10:42.034
SIZE OF THAT STRUCTURAL DEFICIT

02:10:42.100 --> 02:10:43.468
RATHER THAN CREATING A SURPLUS.

02:10:43.535 --> 02:10:48.106
GAGAN BUT THE SAME TIME. THE

02:10:48.173 --> 02:10:48.674
ONE THE ONE IMPACT WE WOULD

02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:50.742
HAVE THIS. MANY OF THE SERVICES

02:10:50.809 --> 02:10:52.878
THAT WERE PROPOSED CUTS WOULD

02:10:52.945 --> 02:10:54.479
BE CUT SEE YOU WOULD HAVE

02:10:54.546 --> 02:10:56.381
SENIORS WHO WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO

02:10:56.448 --> 02:10:58.217
GET MEALS YOU HAVE SENIORS

02:10:58.283 --> 02:11:00.786
COULDN'T GET. HELP AT HOME YOU

02:11:00.852 --> 02:11:03.355
HAVE- PEOPLE WHO WORKED RELY ON

02:11:03.422 --> 02:11:05.457
MEDI CAL COULDN'T ACCESS MANY

02:11:05.524 --> 02:11:06.992
OF THESE ADDITIONAL SERVICES

02:11:07.059 --> 02:11:08.794
LIKE DENTAL CARE A DIFFERENT

02:11:08.860 --> 02:11:10.729
OPTIONAL BENEFITS- PICNIC THEY

02:11:10.796 --> 02:11:12.164
COULDN'T GET THOSE SO THAT THE

02:11:12.231 --> 02:11:13.532
PART WE WOULD KNOW FOR CERTAIN.

02:11:13.599 --> 02:11:18.036
THAT'S CORRECT SO ON. ONE ONE

02:11:18.103 --> 02:11:19.738
THING AS WE AS WE TALKED ABOUT

02:11:19.805 --> 02:11:21.173
AND I THINK MISS MCCARTY FRIEND

02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:25.177
A VERY WELL. IS WE- NONE OF US

02:11:25.244 --> 02:11:26.511
KNOW WHERE THE ECONOMY'S GOING

02:11:26.578 --> 02:11:27.846
I THINK I THINK THE ONLY THING

02:11:27.913 --> 02:11:29.815
WE KNOW FOR. EVERY BUDGET THAT

02:11:29.881 --> 02:11:32.150
WE PUT TOGETHER IS WHATEVER WE

02:11:32.217 --> 02:11:33.485
WHATEVER BUDGET WE PUT TOGETHER

02:11:33.552 --> 02:11:35.153
IS GOING TO BE WRONG. IT'S AN

02:11:35.220 --> 02:11:36.622
IT'S NEVEREXACTLY AS WE

02:11:36.688 --> 02:11:38.624
PROTECT WE OBVIOUSLY WANT TO

02:11:38.690 --> 02:11:42.327
INSURE. THAT WE ARE BEING-

02:11:42.394 --> 02:11:44.496
FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE. BUT I

02:11:44.563 --> 02:11:47.366
THINK THE QUESTION ISIN ORDER

02:11:47.432 --> 02:11:49.268
TO PROTECT OUR BOND RATING WE

02:11:49.334 --> 02:11:51.436
HAVE SNOW INTO CALIFORNIANS

02:11:51.503 --> 02:11:53.972
WHO. CAN'T GET ACCESS TO FOOD

02:11:54.039 --> 02:11:56.275
CAN'T GET ACCESS TO HOUSING-

02:11:56.341 --> 02:11:58.777
HAVE- CHALLENGES GETTING HEALTH

02:11:58.844 --> 02:12:01.680
CARE ACCESS IN I THINK WE ARE

02:12:01.747 --> 02:12:04.716
TRYING TO- TO SOME EXTENT.

02:12:04.783 --> 02:12:08.453
BROUGH SAY IT'S OKAY THAT IF.

02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:10.756
WE HAVE A LOWER BOND RATING IN

02:12:10.822 --> 02:12:12.591
ORDER TO PROTECT. THOSE

02:12:12.658 --> 02:12:14.559
MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS I

02:12:14.626 --> 02:12:16.495
THINK THAT'S WHERE I WOULD SAY

02:12:16.561 --> 02:12:18.030
IS- ONE OF THE PRIMARY

02:12:18.096 --> 02:12:19.598
DIFFERENCES IN IN OUR BUDGET

02:12:19.665 --> 02:12:23.068
THAT WE ARE. ASSUMING GREATER-

02:12:23.135 --> 02:12:25.771
FINANCIAL RISK. FOR THE MILLING

02:12:25.837 --> 02:12:27.973
TO CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE ABLE TO

02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:29.675
SAY FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS CAN'T

02:12:29.741 --> 02:12:31.743
GET ACCESS TO CREDIT CAN BORROW

02:12:31.810 --> 02:12:33.945
ANY MONEY CAN'T ASSUME. ANY OF

02:12:34.012 --> 02:12:37.149
THAT- ANY OF THE FINANCIAL RISK.

02:12:37.215 --> 02:12:39.451
I THINK GOING BACK TO THE-

02:12:39.518 --> 02:12:40.986
SISTER BUT DOCTOR WEBER SAID

02:12:41.053 --> 02:12:43.088
ABOUT THE STATE PRISON CLOSURE-

02:12:43.155 --> 02:12:46.058
WE DID IT- PUT FORWARD- TRAILER

02:12:46.124 --> 02:12:49.027
BILL- WE REALLY HOPE THAT- THAT

02:12:49.094 --> 02:12:51.096
WE CAN FIND A FIND A PATH TO

02:12:51.163 --> 02:12:52.764
AGREEMENT ON THAT TRAILER BILL.

02:12:52.831 --> 02:12:56.168
I KNOW THAT ONE OF OUR- ONE OF

02:12:56.234 --> 02:12:57.803
ONE OF THE POINTS OF FOCUS WE

02:12:57.869 --> 02:12:59.871
HAD IN THAT TRAILER BILL. WAS

02:12:59.938 --> 02:13:01.606
TO ENSURE THAT THEIR WORK COST

02:13:01.673 --> 02:13:03.508
SAVINGS THAT IF WE WERE GOING

02:13:03.575 --> 02:13:05.177
TO DO THE TO PRISON CLOSURES.

02:13:05.243 --> 02:13:06.178
THAT WE WERE ALSO GONNA HAVE

02:13:06.244 --> 02:13:08.413
COST SAVINGS BUT ALSO HAVE

02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:11.249
MINIMUM IMPACT TO BOTH THE

02:13:11.316 --> 02:13:12.784
WORKERS BUT ALSO TO THE

02:13:12.851 --> 02:13:14.086
FAMILIES OF THE INMATES AS

02:13:14.152 --> 02:13:16.521
WELL. AND WE REALLY HOPE THAT-

02:13:16.588 --> 02:13:18.290
THAT WE CAN FIND AN AGREEMENT

02:13:18.357 --> 02:13:19.758
NO THE ADMINISTRATION SHARES

02:13:19.825 --> 02:13:22.027
SHARES IS EXACT SAME GOALS. AS

02:13:22.094 --> 02:13:24.529
THE- THE WAY THE TRAILER BILL

02:13:24.596 --> 02:13:25.364
PUTS WRITTEN BUT WE HOPE THAT

02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:27.232
WE CAN. HAVE A CONVERSATION OF

02:13:27.299 --> 02:13:31.670
THAT. BUT I THINK. OVER ALL.

02:13:31.737 --> 02:13:34.272
WHERE AS AS WE PUT TOGETHER THE

02:13:34.339 --> 02:13:38.377
CONSTRUCTION OF THIS BUDGET-

02:13:38.443 --> 02:13:40.112
YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO KIND OF

02:13:40.178 --> 02:13:42.681
IMAGINE THE WORLD BEFORE. MOVE

02:13:42.748 --> 02:13:44.983
IT BUT IF WE THINK ABOUT WHERE

02:13:45.050 --> 02:13:48.520
WE WERE IN FEBRUARY. I THINK

02:13:48.587 --> 02:13:50.155
IT'S A GOOD REMINDER WE WERE AT

02:13:50.222 --> 02:13:52.924
FULL UNEMPLOYMENT. BUT YET WE

02:13:52.991 --> 02:13:55.327
HAD MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS

02:13:55.394 --> 02:13:59.598
WHO. NEVER HOW. FULL EMPLOYMENT

02:13:59.664 --> 02:14:01.466
FOR DOES A UNEMPLOYMENT I'M

02:14:01.533 --> 02:14:02.100
SORRY EXCUSE OKAY THANK YOU FOR

02:14:02.167 --> 02:14:04.202
THAT CORRECTION- WE HAVE WE

02:14:04.269 --> 02:14:05.036
HAVE FULL WE HAVE FULL

02:14:05.103 --> 02:14:07.205
EMPLOYMENT- BE AT THE SAME TIME

02:14:07.272 --> 02:14:08.807
WE HAD MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS

02:14:08.874 --> 02:14:11.843
WHO NEVER- REALLY RECOVERED

02:14:11.910 --> 02:14:13.645
FROM THE LAST RECESSION AND I

02:14:13.712 --> 02:14:16.548
THINK. THAT IS- MAINLY DUE TO

02:14:16.615 --> 02:14:18.817
MANY THE DEVASTATING CUTS TO

02:14:18.884 --> 02:14:20.819
OUR SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROGRAMS

02:14:20.886 --> 02:14:24.689
THAT- MANY MANY FAMILIES RELY

02:14:24.756 --> 02:14:27.626
ON A AND BECAUSE OF THAT-

02:14:27.692 --> 02:14:29.795
BECAUSE OF THOSE CUTS WE HAD

02:14:29.861 --> 02:14:31.863
SOME OF THE LARGEST INCOME

02:14:31.930 --> 02:14:33.999
INEQUALITY AT THE WE'VE EVER

02:14:34.065 --> 02:14:35.734
SEEN IN THE STATE'S HISTORY.

02:14:35.801 --> 02:14:37.335
THIS STATE HAS TRADITIONALLY

02:14:37.402 --> 02:14:38.570
ALWAYS BEEN A STATE WHERE WE'VE

02:14:38.637 --> 02:14:40.605
HAD VERY A VERY STRONG MIDDLE

02:14:40.672 --> 02:14:43.508
CLASS WE'VE HAD PROSPERITY FOR

02:14:43.575 --> 02:14:45.277
PEOPLE WHO'VE COME FROM OTHER

02:14:45.343 --> 02:14:46.344
PARTS OF THE COUNTRY OR THE

02:14:46.411 --> 02:14:47.813
PARTS OF THE WORLD TO REALLY

02:14:47.879 --> 02:14:49.848
COME HERE WITH A NOT A WHOLE

02:14:49.915 --> 02:14:51.116
LOT TO BE ABLE TO FINANCIALLY

02:14:51.183 --> 02:14:54.219
SUCCEED. IT IS HARDER EVERY DAY

02:14:54.286 --> 02:14:55.787
FOR PEOPLE WHO COME HERE BUT

02:14:55.854 --> 02:14:56.555
ALSO FOR THE PEOPLE WHO GREW UP

02:14:56.621 --> 02:14:58.690
HERE TECHNICALLY TO CD AND I

02:14:58.757 --> 02:15:01.359
THINK PART OF THAT IS THE

02:15:01.426 --> 02:15:03.562
SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ARE-

02:15:03.628 --> 02:15:06.498
BUDGET PUTS TOGETHER WAS REALLY

02:15:06.565 --> 02:15:08.200
HAMPERED IN THE LAST RECESSION.

02:15:08.266 --> 02:15:12.103
SO I THINK WHAT WE WANTED TO DO

02:15:12.170 --> 02:15:14.840
WAS BEFORE. WE ARE MAKE THESE

02:15:14.906 --> 02:15:17.075
DEVASTATING CUTS. THAT ARE

02:15:17.142 --> 02:15:19.344
BASED ON FISCAL ASSUMPTIONS

02:15:19.411 --> 02:15:22.047
THAT AGAIN NONE OF US KNOW HOW

02:15:22.113 --> 02:15:24.382
ACCURATE. THEY WILL BE A IS TO

02:15:24.449 --> 02:15:26.418
REALLY MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T

02:15:26.485 --> 02:15:27.786
DO THOSE CUTS UNTIL WE

02:15:27.853 --> 02:15:30.021
ABSOLUTELY. HAVE TO DO THEM.

02:15:30.088 --> 02:15:31.022
WE'RE AT A POINT WHERE THE

02:15:31.089 --> 02:15:34.326
ECONOMY IS STARTING TO RE OPEN.

02:15:34.392 --> 02:15:36.528
WE HOPE IT WILL RE OPEN-

02:15:36.595 --> 02:15:40.031
WITHOUT ANOTHER SPIKE IN COVERT

02:15:40.098 --> 02:15:43.435
CASES- BUT WE DON'T KOW- AND

02:15:43.502 --> 02:15:45.670
IF NOT- WITHOUT A CURSE THE

02:15:45.737 --> 02:15:47.672
HOPE IS THAT PERHAPS- WE'RE

02:15:47.739 --> 02:15:48.940
GOING TO BE IN A BETTER

02:15:49.007 --> 02:15:52.244
ECONOMIC SITUATION. THEN I WILL

02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:53.545
HAVE PROJECTED DEPARTMENT

02:15:53.612 --> 02:15:54.746
FINEST PROJECT I KNOW THAT'S

02:15:54.813 --> 02:15:55.981
WHAT WE ALL HOPE FOR WE'RE NOT

02:15:56.047 --> 02:15:57.716
HOPING FOR A DIRE PREDICTION.

02:15:57.782 --> 02:16:00.218
SO AND GET ON HOPES OF THAT I

02:16:00.285 --> 02:16:04.489
THINK IT MAKES SENSE IN JUNE.

02:16:04.556 --> 02:16:06.558
TWO NOT PULL THE BUTTON BECAUSE

02:16:06.625 --> 02:16:08.260
ONCE YOU CUT THESE PROGRAMS.

02:16:08.326 --> 02:16:09.995
THE VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO

02:16:10.061 --> 02:16:13.198
BRING BACK- WE CAN IF THE

02:16:13.265 --> 02:16:14.866
ECONOMY CONTINUES TO GO BAD WE

02:16:14.933 --> 02:16:16.368
OBVIOUSLY CAN REVISIT THESE

02:16:16.434 --> 02:16:18.103
DISCUSSIONS IN AUGUST. I

02:16:18.169 --> 02:16:19.404
MEASURE WILL BE REVISITING

02:16:19.471 --> 02:16:21.006
ISSUE THESE ISSUES IN JANUARY

02:16:21.072 --> 02:16:22.874
WHEN WE COME BACK TO SESSION. I

02:16:22.941 --> 02:16:25.277
THINK THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME TO

02:16:25.343 --> 02:16:27.913
REACT TO THE SITUATION TO. DO

02:16:27.979 --> 02:16:29.447
WHAT WE THINK IS BEST AT THE

02:16:29.514 --> 02:16:33.652
TIME THAT WE DO THEM. SO I

02:16:33.718 --> 02:16:34.286
REALLY WOULD JUST URGE. THE AS

02:16:34.352 --> 02:16:35.987
WE GO IN THIS DISCUSSION. TO

02:16:36.054 --> 02:16:37.989
JUST THINK VERY CAREFULLY

02:16:38.056 --> 02:16:40.358
ABOUT- THESE CUTS BEFORE YOU DO

02:16:40.425 --> 02:16:41.860
THAT BECAUSE ONCE YOU DO THEM

02:16:41.927 --> 02:16:46.097
AGAIN. EVEN IF THE PROJECTIONS-

02:16:46.164 --> 02:16:48.166
COME IN MUCH MORE OPTIMISTIC

02:16:48.233 --> 02:16:50.368
THAN WE HAD PREVIOUSLY HOPED-

02:16:50.435 --> 02:16:52.404
YOU CAN'T JUST BRING BACK

02:16:52.470 --> 02:16:52.938
TEACHERS TO BEEN LAID OFF

02:16:53.004 --> 02:16:54.806
BECAUSE THEY'RE GONE. YOU CAN'T

02:16:54.873 --> 02:16:56.374
JUST BRING BACK THESE PROGRAMS

02:16:56.441 --> 02:16:58.209
TO START AT THE TAKES A YEARS

02:16:58.276 --> 02:16:59.778
OFTENTIMES TO START UP THESE

02:16:59.844 --> 02:17:02.347
PROGRAMS AGAIN. SO AGAIN- I

02:17:02.414 --> 02:17:03.882
THINK IT IS IT IS IMPORTANT I

02:17:03.949 --> 02:17:05.951
THINK WE HAVE PUT TOGETHER. A

02:17:06.017 --> 02:17:10.622
FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE BUDGET--BECAUSE WE'VE WAITED THE COST

02:17:10.689 --> 02:17:13.658
OF NOT HELPING THE MILLIONS OF

02:17:13.725 --> 02:17:16.227
CALIFORNIANS WHO WOULD GO WOULD

02:17:16.294 --> 02:17:18.630
GO HUNGRY WOULD GO ON SHELTER-

02:17:18.697 --> 02:17:21.333
WOULD REALLY BE IN DIRE NEED

02:17:21.399 --> 02:17:23.768
WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE THAT WE

02:17:23.835 --> 02:17:25.904
COULD. PROVIDE THE SO WITH THAT

02:17:25.971 --> 02:17:28.106
I SEE A DARK MIST MISTER BLOOM

02:17:28.173 --> 02:17:29.341
HAS SOME THANKS IF I COULD JUST

02:17:29.407 --> 02:17:32.010
ASK A QUICK QUESTION WHICH I

02:17:32.077 --> 02:17:34.145
HOPE WILL BE INFORMATIVE- HOW

02:17:34.212 --> 02:17:36.314
ARE ACTUAL REVENUES DOING

02:17:36.381 --> 02:17:39.384
COMPARED TO THOSE. PROJECTED IN

02:17:39.451 --> 02:17:42.587

02:17:42.654 --> 02:17:43.955
CHAMBERLAIN ON THE LINE WHO

02:17:44.022 --> 02:17:45.390
COULD SPEAK TO IN TERMS OF JUST

02:17:45.457 --> 02:17:47.525
THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS I SHOULD

02:17:47.592 --> 02:17:50.195
CLARIFY THAT THE REAL- WE'LL

02:17:50.261 --> 02:17:51.796

02:17:51.863 --> 02:17:52.831
FIFTEENTH BECAUSE THAT'S THE

02:17:52.897 --> 02:17:54.399
APRIL FIFTEENTH- PUSH THREE

02:17:54.466 --> 02:17:56.301
MONTHS FORWARD- BUT J. CHAMBER

02:17:56.368 --> 02:17:57.268
ONE CAN SPEAK TO THAT EVERY

02:17:57.335 --> 02:17:59.471
MONTH WE MOVE FORWARD IT.

02:17:59.537 --> 02:18:04.342
BECOMES MORE ACCURATE. HI MA'AM

02:18:17.322 --> 02:18:20.759
WITH PROJECTED ARE STILL DOWN A

02:18:20.825 --> 02:18:21.426
VERY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE

02:18:21.493 --> 02:18:24.596
PRIOR YEAR- BUT THROUGHOUT

02:18:24.663 --> 02:18:28.767
NINETEEN. BUT OKAY BUT THE TO

ROUGHLY IT'S ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED

02:18:43.615 --> 02:18:45.884
MILLION DOLLARS OVER OUR-

02:18:45.950 --> 02:18:47.652
PROJECTION I THINK IT WAS IT

02:18:47.719 --> 02:18:49.788
WAS PRIMARILY WITHHOLDING CAME

02:18:49.854 --> 02:18:51.990
IN STRONGER THEN WE HAD

02:18:52.057 --> 02:18:57.862

THAT THE QUESTION IN AGAIN I

02:19:22.153 --> 02:19:25.190
THINK IT DEMONSTRATES- THE

02:19:25.256 --> 02:19:28.126
POINT TO INSURE THAT WE HAVE

02:19:28.193 --> 02:19:31.196
