HOW CAN WE INSURE?

00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:35.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT LOW INCOME CHILDREN ARE

00:20:36.001 --> 00:20:38.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RECEIVING THE TESTING THAT'S.

00:20:38.704 --> 00:20:42.140 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REQUIRED AND IS PAID FOR BY THE

00:20:42.207 --> 00:20:44.509 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%

SO.

00:20:46.311 --> 00:20:48.080 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:20:48.146 --> 00:20:49.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND.

00:20:49.715 --> 00:20:52.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IN MORE DETAIL HOW THE STATE

00:20:52.284 --> 00:20:53.552 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TRACK

00:20:53.619 --> 00:20:55.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CHILDREN ON THESE PROGRAMS

00:20:55.821 --> 00:20:57.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
SUCH AS MEDI CAL.

00:20:57.356 --> 00:20:58.924 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO ENSURE THEY RECEIVING THEIR

00:20:58.991 --> 00:21:00.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
BLOOD TEST.

00:21:00.926 --> 00:21:03.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AS THEY ARE ARE REQUIRED TO DO.

00:21:03.962 --> 00:21:06.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND TO ENSURE THEY ARE RECEIVING

00:21:06.732 --> 00:21:08.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THESE BLOOD LEAD TO HAVE TESTS

00:21:08.567 --> 00:21:10.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
IS THEY SHOULD.

00:21:10.335 --> 00:21:13.105 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WE CAN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

00:21:13.171 --> 00:21:15.307 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
WE CAN'T HELP THE KIDS.

00:21:15.374 --> 00:21:17.075 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
UNLESS THEY'RE TESTED.

00:21:17.142 --> 00:21:19.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
AND.

00:21:19.444 --> 00:21:21.546 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BOB THAT PANELS CAN ADDRESS THIS

00:21:21.613 --> 00:21:23.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ISSUE THE PUBLIC DATA WE SEEM

00:21:23.682 --> 00:21:25.317 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SHOWS THAT ONLY ABOUT TWENTY

00:21:25.384 --> 00:21:26.518 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EIGHT PERCENT OF THE CHILDREN ON

00:21:26.585 --> 00:21:27.886 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
MEDI CAL.

00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:29.655 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I HAVE BEEN TESTED ANNUALLY FOR

00:21:29.721 --> 00:21:31.657 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
THE PAST FIVE YEARS.

00:21:31.723 --> 00:21:33.992 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO IS THAT DATA CORRECT AND IS

00:21:34.059 --> 00:21:35.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO MAKE

00:21:35.127 --> 00:21:36.928 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
IT BETTER.

00:21:36.995 --> 00:21:39.564 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE HAVE LONG KNOWN THAT LED IS

00:21:39.631 --> 00:21:41.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HIGHLY TOXIC ESPECIALLY FOR KIDS

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THERE'S JUST NO SAFE LEVEL

00:21:43.535 --> 00:21:47.272 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
OF LEAD.

00:21:47.339 --> 00:21:49.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
CAUSES REAL.

00:21:49.141 --> 00:21:50.942 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PERSONALITY DISORDERS THERE IS

00:21:51.009 --> 00:21:53.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SOME SPECULATION THAT THE

00:21:53.445 --> 00:21:55.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
DECREASE IN CRIME.

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:57.516 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STARTED NINETIES I WAS DUE TO

00:21:57.582 --> 00:21:59.351 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE FACT THAT SO MUCH LEAD WAS

00:21:59.418 --> 00:22:01.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TAKEN OUT OF THE ENVIRONMENT.

00:22:01.153 --> 00:22:02.554 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NO ONE KNOWS IF THAT'S TRUE OR

00:22:02.621 --> 00:22:04.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NOT. BUT THE FACT THAT YOU CAN

00:22:04.656 --> 00:22:06.858 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
EVEN MAKE THAT HYPOTHESIS.

00:22:06.925 --> 00:22:08.493 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SHOWS THE DANGERS OF LAND IN

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.329 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
BLOOD.

00:22:11.396 --> 00:22:13.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
A LETTER COURSE IS LISTED UNDER

00:22:13.231 --> 00:22:14.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PROP SIXTY FIVE IS SUBSTANCE

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT CAN CAUSE REPRODUCTIVE

00:22:16.401 --> 00:22:17.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
DAMAGE.

00:22:17.569 --> 00:22:19.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
BIRTH DEFECTS.

00:22:19.204 --> 00:22:21.106 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
ARMED.

00:22:21.173 --> 00:22:23.542 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LEAD EXPOSURE IN LEAD POISONING

00:22:23.608 --> 00:22:25.310 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ARE ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH

00:22:25.377 --> 00:22:27.746 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
COGNITIVE ANOTHER HEALTH
IMPACTS.

00:22:27.813 --> 00:22:30.015 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ESPECIALLY TO CHILDREN AND THEY

00:22:30.082 --> 00:22:32.584 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
CAN BE A REVERSIBLE.

00:22:32.651 --> 00:22:34.119 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
MILLIONS OF CHILDREN ARE

00:22:34.186 --> 00:22:35.353 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EXPOSED TO LEAD IN THEIR HOMES

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:36.955 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
THROUGH LEAD PAINT.

00:22:37.022 --> 00:22:39.157 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUT THERE ARE OTHER SOURCES WELL

00:22:39.224 --> 00:22:40.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
YOU CAN JUST BE IN AN OLDER

00:22:40.759 --> 00:22:41.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
NEIGHBORHOOD AND WHILE YOUR

00:22:41.727 --> 00:22:43.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HOUSE DOESN'T HAVE LEAD PAINT

00:22:43.929 --> 00:22:45.430 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
EDUCATION HOMES CAN.

00:22:45.497 --> 00:22:47.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU CAN BE NEAR A HIGHWAY WHERE

00:22:47.733 --> 00:22:50.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THERE WAS LOTS OF EXHAUST FROM

00:22:50.268 --> 00:22:52.104 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
CARS THAT HAD LEAD IN IT.

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:54.372 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ARM AND WE KNOW THAT IT CAN

00:22:54.439 --> 00:22:56.641 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CAUSE PROBLEMS TO THE BRAIN SLOW

00:22:56.708 --> 00:22:58.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT.

00:22:58.577 --> 00:23:00.145 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LEARNING AND BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS

00:23:00.212 --> 00:23:03.715 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
HEARING AND SPEECH YOU

00:23:03.782 --> 00:23:05.183 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND ALTHOUGH ALL KIDS ARE AT

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:07.452 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RISK PARTICULARLY THE KIDS ON

00:23:07.519 --> 00:23:09.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
MEDICARE HOW OF POOR AND

00:23:09.221 --> 00:23:10.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
MINORITY CHILDREN ARE

00:23:10.188 --> 00:23:11.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED NET

00:23:12.023 --> 00:23:13.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
HIGHEST RISK.

00:23:13.725 --> 00:23:15.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND IF ANY CHILD AT HIGH RISK

00:23:15.327 --> 00:23:17.095 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GOES UNTESTED THAT CHILD WILL

00:23:17.162 --> 00:23:18.330 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%

THAT'S.

00:23:23.168 --> 00:23:24.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

WORK.

00:33:45.823 --> 00:33:47.325 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IS FIRST FALL IS THE NUMBER

00:33:47.392 --> 00:33:49.494 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT.

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:50.795 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHICH IS THE ONLY PUBLIC NUMBER

00:33:50.862 --> 00:33:52.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WE HAD FOR THE NUMBER OF

00:33:52.897 --> 00:33:54.365 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CHILDREN WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR.

00:33:54.432 --> 00:33:56.401 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
REIMBURSEMENT UNDER MEDI CAL

00:33:56.467 --> 00:33:57.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
AND BLACK

00:33:57.668 --> 00:33:59.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THEM

00:33:59.103 --> 00:34:00.304 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BEING TESTED IS THAT DO YOU

00:34:00.371 --> 00:34:02.306 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
THINK A GOOD NUMBER.

00:34:02.373 --> 00:34:04.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO I DON'T WE DON'T HAVE GOOD

00:34:04.375 --> 00:34:06.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MEANING AT ACCURATE IDEA BECAUSE

00:34:06.144 --> 00:34:07.145 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO THINK NOW WE ALL AGREE IT

00:34:07.211 --> 00:34:08.346 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WOULDN'T BE GOOD IF ONLY TWENTY

00:34:08.413 --> 00:34:10.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EIGHT PERCENT AT HOW ACCURATE IS

00:34:10.148 --> 00:34:11.549 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT NUMBER SO I'M GOING TO

00:34:11.616 --> 00:34:12.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DEFER QUESTIONS AT THAT THAT

00:34:12.884 --> 00:34:14.919 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
RELY ON MEDI CAL DATA TO.

00:34:14.986 --> 00:34:16.587 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MY COLLEAGUE JENNIFER CAN'T

00:34:16.654 --> 00:34:17.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY WE DON'T

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:19.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAVE ACCESS TO THE MEDICAL DATA

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:21.592 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT.

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:23.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WHAT VOTE CALIFORNIA LED

00:34:23.661 --> 00:34:24.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PREVENTION PROGRAM POISONING

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:26.497 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PREVENTION PROGRAM HAS DONE IN

00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:27.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
THE PAST?

00:34:27.698 --> 00:34:30.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IS A MANUAL ASSESSMENT OF.

00:34:30.401 --> 00:34:32.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ARE OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE

00:34:32.837 --> 00:34:33.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
PERCENTAGE OF LOW INCOME

00:34:33.738 --> 00:34:34.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE

00:34:34.906 --> 00:34:36.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
BEEN TESTED.

00:34:36.441 --> 00:34:37.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
WE'VE DONE THIS BY.

00:34:37.575 --> 00:34:39.777 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
USING U. S. CENSUS DATA TO

00:34:39.844 --> 00:34:40.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
ESTIMATE THAT THERE

00:34:40.711 --> 00:34:42.346 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
APPROXIMATELY A MILLION CHILDREN

00:34:42.413 --> 00:34:43.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN CALIFORNIA BETWEEN THE AGES

00:34:43.848 --> 00:34:44.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF ONE AND TWO SO THAT'S THE

00:34:44.982 --> 00:34:48.052 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
POPULATION. OVER ALL WITH WHO

00:34:48.119 --> 00:34:49.954 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARE I'M AT OR BELOW TWO HUNDRED

00:34:50.021 --> 00:34:51.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FIFTY PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL

00:34:51.189 --> 00:34:52.657 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
POVERTY LEVEL TO THAT'S THE

00:34:52.723 --> 00:34:54.158 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NUMBER OF CHILDREN THAT WE WOULD

00:34:54.225 --> 00:34:56.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
EXPECT TO HAVE TESTED.

00:34:56.661 --> 00:34:58.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IF AT THE SAME TIME WE IF WE

00:34:58.896 --> 00:35:00.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN

00:35:00.164 --> 00:35:02.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
WHO WERE LED TESTED IN

00:35:02.133 --> 00:35:04.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
CALIFORNIA WHAT WE SEE IS

00:35:04.068 --> 00:35:04.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY TWO

00:35:05.002 --> 00:35:06.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
PERCENT.

00:35:06.971 --> 00:35:08.272 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF THE CHILDREN THAT WE HAVE

00:35:08.339 --> 00:35:09.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT NUMBER THAT WE EXPECT TO BE

00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:10.875 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN TESTED AT

00:35:10.942 --> 00:35:11.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
LEAST ONCE.

00:35:12.009 --> 00:35:13.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
AND.

00:35:14.045 --> 00:35:15.546 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DR CHARLTON WLL CORRECT ME IF I

00:35:15.613 --> 00:35:16.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MAKE ANY MISSTATEMENTS ABOUT

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:17.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THOSE

00:35:17.415 --> 00:35:19.884 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SO THAT WE DON'T BE BECAUSE.

00:35:19.951 --> 00:35:22.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LEVEL OF INCOME IS NOT AN IT

00:35:22.887 --> 00:35:24.522 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BAG COLLECTED WITH FOR THE

00:35:24.589 --> 00:35:25.590 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING

00:35:25.656 --> 00:35:27.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
PREVENTION DATA WE GOT.

00:35:27.925 --> 00:35:29.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WITH ELECTRONIC LAB REPORTING

00:35:29.794 --> 00:35:31.329 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OF ALL LEAD TESTING DONE IN

00:35:31.395 --> 00:35:33.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CALIFORNIA ALL AGES INCLUDING

00:35:33.231 --> 00:35:34.432 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
ALL CHILDREN.

00:35:34.499 --> 00:35:36.801 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HOWEVER THE INCOME THE FAMILY

00:35:36.868 --> 00:35:38.636 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INCOME LEVEL IS NOT ONE OF THE

00:35:38.703 --> 00:35:41.706 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PIECES OF DATA THAT'S COLLECTED.

00:35:41.772 --> 00:35:42.373 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
SO WE'VE USED THIS.

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:46.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SURROGATE METHOD FOR ESTIMATING

00:35:46.177 --> 00:35:46.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF TESTING

00:35:47.044 --> 00:35:48.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT'S HOW BOOK OKAY BUT HOW

00:35:48.145 --> 00:35:50.448 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MANY TOTAL CHILDREN ARE THERE.

00:35:50.515 --> 00:35:52.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
ARE.

00:35:52.617 --> 00:35:54.385 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BETWEEN THE AGES OF ARE SIX

00:35:54.452 --> 00:35:57.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
MONTHS AND SIX YEARS.

00:35:57.154 --> 00:35:58.356 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THERE WERE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED

00:35:58.422 --> 00:35:59.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THOUSAND CHILDREN BORN IN

00:35:59.891 --> 00:36:01.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
CALIFORNIA EVERY YEAR.

00:36:01.692 --> 00:36:03.561 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT'S DROPPED A LITTLE OVER THE

00:36:03.628 --> 00:36:04.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OKAY RETAILERS THAT WOULD BE

00:36:04.729 --> 00:36:07.398 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ABOUT A MILLION TOTAL CHILDREN.

00:36:07.465 --> 00:36:09.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
AGE TWO AND THREE.

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:10.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND I'M WE HAD ESTIMATED AT

00:36:11.002 --> 00:36:11.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TWENTY FIFTY PERCENT OF POVERTY

00:36:12.036 --> 00:36:13.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LEVEL THAT THERE'S ABOUT FIVE

00:36:13.604 --> 00:36:14.639 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND SUCH

00:36:14.705 --> 00:36:16.641 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
CHILDREN.

00:36:16.707 --> 00:36:17.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
AND WE GET OUR.

00:36:17.375 --> 00:36:18.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
BLOOD LEAD TEST RESULTS

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:20.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ELECTRONICALLY FROM THE LABS SO

00:36:20.778 --> 00:36:21.846 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE GET INDIVIDUAL REPORTS AND

00:36:21.913 --> 00:36:23.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THE CHILDREN WERE TESTED.

00:36:23.748 --> 00:36:25.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
OKAY SO THIS FIVE HUNDRED

00:36:25.082 --> 00:36:27.051 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SEVENTY THOUSAND CHILDREN AND

00:36:27.118 --> 00:36:29.387 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEN HOW MANY ACTUAL TESTS ARE

00:36:29.453 --> 00:36:32.390 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DONE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND NINE

00:36:32.456 --> 00:36:34.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THOUSAND WOULD INCLUDE. CHILDREN

00:36:34.358 --> 00:36:36.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AGE NINE MONTHS TO TWELVE MONTHS

00:36:36.127 --> 00:36:37.094 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BECAUSE SOME CHILDREN GET THEIR

00:36:37.161 --> 00:36:39.096 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ONE YEAR VISIT IN A FEW MONTHS

00:36:39.163 --> 00:36:40.598 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BEFORE. AND THEN ABOUT THREE

00:36:40.665 --> 00:36:42.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND

00:36:42.099 --> 00:36:44.702 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CHILDREN AGED TWO AND THREE.

00:36:44.769 --> 00:36:46.571 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SHOW WHEN WE COMPARE THOSE WE'RE

00:36:46.637 --> 00:36:48.539 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ENDING UP WITH A. AS WAS SAID

00:36:48.606 --> 00:36:50.041 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AYE AYE NUMBER IN THE MID

00:36:50.107 --> 00:36:53.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SEVENTIES FOR CHILDREN WHAT WE

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:53.911 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BELIEVE ARE GETTING TEST. BUT.

00:36:53.978 --> 00:36:54.979 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT'S ASSUMING THAT ALL THE

00:36:55.046 --> 00:36:56.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CHILDREN GETTING TESTED ARE LOW

00:36:56.447 --> 00:36:58.849 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
INCOME.

00:36:58.916 --> 00:37:00.718 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO AND THAT'S OUR TARGETED GROUP

00:37:00.785 --> 00:37:02.553 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AS WITH EXPLAIN WHY AND WHEN WE

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:04.655 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LOOK AT CASES CHILDREN WHO HAVE

00:37:04.722 --> 00:37:05.590 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
VERY HIGH BLOOD LEAD LEVEL TO

00:37:05.656 --> 00:37:07.425 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
GET THE. CASE SERVICES THAT

00:37:07.491 --> 00:37:08.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
DOCTOR SMITH EXPLAINED

00:37:08.593 --> 00:37:10.061 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF

00:37:10.127 --> 00:37:12.597 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
THEM ARE MEDI CAL.

00:37:12.663 --> 00:37:13.497 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SHOW YOU COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT

00:37:13.564 --> 00:37:15.433 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND AND MOVE IT DOWN. AND THEN

00:37:15.499 --> 00:37:17.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ALSO SOME CHILDREN GET A TEST

00:37:17.335 --> 00:37:19.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AFTER TO THAT MAKE UP TEST SO

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:20.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
THEY MAY BE.

00:37:20.738 --> 00:37:22.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THREE AND A HALF OR SOMETHING

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.674 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
LIKE THAT.

00:37:23.741 --> 00:37:25.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
TOGETHER TO WE BELIEVE A

00:37:25.376 --> 00:37:26.911 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CONSIDERABLY MORE CHILDREN ARE

00:37:26.978 --> 00:37:27.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BEING TESTED THEM THAT TWENTY

00:37:28.012 --> 00:37:29.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EIGHT PERCENT WOULD INDICATE.

00:37:30.014 --> 00:37:32.350 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
OKAY ARM.

00:37:32.416 --> 00:37:34.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:05%
I.

00:37:34.151 --> 00:37:37.288 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
CERTAINLY.

00:37:37.355 --> 00:37:38.356 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND PREPS I CAN ASK MY STAFF

00:37:38.422 --> 00:37:54.672 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
JUST TO QUESTION

.

00:37:58.943 --> 00:38:00.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THIRD DOWN RIGHT I'LL GET SO I'M

00:38:00.578 --> 00:38:02.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
JUST NOT SURE I BELIEVE YOUR

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:04.649 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NUMBERS. AYE BUT I'D ONE WILL

00:38:04.715 --> 00:38:06.584 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WILL HAVE WILL TRY AND GO TO IT.

00:38:06.651 --> 00:38:07.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:38:08.052 --> 00:38:09.954 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THOSE EXTRAPOLATIONS ARE REALLY

00:38:10.021 --> 00:38:12.390 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
DEPENDING UPON.

00:38:12.456 --> 00:38:14.558 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
THE FACT THAT.

00:38:14.625 --> 00:38:16.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WELL FOR EXAMPLE I COULD BELIEVE

00:38:16.527 --> 00:38:18.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:20.598 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THERE IS A LESS OF A CHANCE OF

00:38:20.665 --> 00:38:22.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
HIGHER INCOME PEOPLE.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.068 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LIVING IN HOMES THAT HAVE LED

00:38:24.135 --> 00:38:25.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PROBLEMS AND IF FOR SOME REASON

00:38:26.003 --> 00:38:27.805 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THEY WERE GETTING TESTED AT A

00:38:27.872 --> 00:38:29.940 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HIGH RATE YOU CAN. UNDERESTIMATE

00:38:30.007 --> 00:38:31.609 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE NUMBER WHERE IS THE NUMBER

00:38:31.676 --> 00:38:33.277 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE'RE GETTING FROM MEDICAL DATA

00:38:33.344 --> 00:38:36.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IS I THINK MORE HARD DATA BUT.

00:38:36.447 --> 00:38:40.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I WILL ADMIT TO BEING CONFUSED.

00:38:40.251 --> 00:38:41.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
AND I MENTIONED

00:38:41.719 --> 00:38:43.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE DID IT WAS A FEW YEARS BACK.

00:38:43.287 --> 00:38:45.056 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
TO AN ACTUAL MATCH

00:38:45.122 --> 00:38:46.123 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I'M GETS CHILDREN WHO AND MEDI

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:47.324 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
CAL

00:38:47.391 --> 00:38:49.160 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
TALK COULD FIND AND LOOK.

00:38:49.226 --> 00:38:50.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AT WHETHER WE COULD FIND THEM

00:38:50.361 --> 00:38:52.430 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BETWEEN AGE NINE MONTHS AND

00:38:52.496 --> 00:38:52.997 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TWENTY SEVEN MONTHS IN OUR

00:38:53.064 --> 00:38:55.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DATABASE. OF CHILDREN SHOWING UP

00:38:55.599 --> 00:38:57.134 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
FOR SERVICES AT MEDICO.

00:38:57.201 --> 00:38:58.302 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WE GOT ABOUT THE SAME ABOUT

00:38:58.369 --> 00:38:59.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SEVENTY FIVE SEVENTY SEVEN

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:01.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PERCENT OF CHILDREN WERE GETTING

00:39:01.539 --> 00:39:03.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AT LEAST ONE BUT LET TEST.

00:39:03.074 --> 00:39:03.574 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AND FOR CHILDREN THAT WE

00:39:03.641 --> 00:39:04.875 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
COULDN'T DOCUMENT ANY OTHER

00:39:04.942 --> 00:39:06.210 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
MEDICAL SERVICES

00:39:06.277 --> 00:39:08.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
WE WERE GETTING SIXTY.

00:39:08.345 --> 00:39:09.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THREE PERCENT CHAU SO CLEARLY WE

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:11.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ALL NEED TO TO TRY AND FIGURE

00:39:12.016 --> 00:39:13.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OUT WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE MARIN.

00:39:13.184 --> 00:39:14.819 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WELL EVEN IF IT'S SEVENTY SOME

00:39:14.885 --> 00:39:16.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PERCENT THEN THERE'S TWENTY FIVE

00:39:16.987 --> 00:39:19.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
PERCENT WHO AREN'T. UP.

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:21.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WHAT OTHER THINGS FOR THE

00:39:21.892 --> 00:39:23.394 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE

00:39:23.461 --> 00:39:25.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PERCENT AND SEVENTY PERCENT THAT

00:39:25.596 --> 00:39:27.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
AREN'T BEING TESTED?

00:39:27.231 --> 00:39:30.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
UP WHERE WHERE WE LOSING PEOPLE.

00:39:30.067 --> 00:39:32.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
SO.

00:39:33.003 --> 00:39:34.171 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DON'T KNOW

00:39:34.238 --> 00:39:35.706 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUT I'M NOT SAID I THINK THAT

00:39:35.773 --> 00:39:37.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE MOST LIKELY IT LIKELY IS THE

00:39:37.975 --> 00:39:40.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE SAME POPULATION THAT WE ARE

00:39:40.411 --> 00:39:41.746 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NOT REACHING IN OTHER WAYS TO

00:39:41.812 --> 00:39:43.414 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THOSE WHO ARE NOT ACTIVELY

00:39:43.481 --> 00:39:45.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ENGAGING IN ANY SERVICE SO

00:39:45.883 --> 00:39:47.284 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
WHETHER IT'S.

00:39:47.351 --> 00:39:48.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
A WOMEN IT'S FOR INFANTS AND

00:39:48.652 --> 00:39:49.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CHILDREN BUT THEY'RE ALSO NOT

00:39:49.887 --> 00:39:51.622 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ACCESSING HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS

00:39:51.689 --> 00:39:54.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
* WHO WHO BILL THEY MAY BE

00:39:54.425 --> 00:39:56.026 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GETTING SERVICES IN FREE CLINICS

00:39:56.093 --> 00:39:57.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ETCETERA SO THERE'S A LARGE

00:39:57.261 --> 00:39:58.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
POPULATION OF PEOPLE

00:39:58.329 --> 00:40:00.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
PARTICULARLY. OF RECENT

00:40:00.231 --> 00:40:02.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IMMIGRANTS WHO DON'T ACTUALLY.

00:40:02.666 --> 00:40:04.635 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ENGAGE IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR

00:40:04.702 --> 00:40:06.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
VERY MUCH AT ALL AND IT MAY BE

00:40:06.504 --> 00:40:07.938 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
THAT A PORTION OF THOSE
CHILDREN.

00:40:08.005 --> 00:40:10.508 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
ARE THERE I'M NOT SURE AS FAR
AS.

00:40:10.574 --> 00:40:12.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE THE MEDI CAL POPULATION PER

00:40:12.476 --> 00:40:13.377 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
SE.

00:40:13.444 --> 00:40:15.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I'M NOT REALLY FAMILIAR WITH

00:40:15.746 --> 00:40:16.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE MEDICAL DATA AND SO I THINK

00:40:16.647 --> 00:40:18.682 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I WOULD I ONCE AGAIN REFER TO

00:40:18.749 --> 00:40:19.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
MISS KENT ON THAT.

00:40:19.183 --> 00:40:20.451 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
OKAY.

00:40:20.518 --> 00:40:24.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:40:24.321 --> 00:40:25.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST A BE DONE

00:40:25.656 --> 00:40:27.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
TO GET?

00:40:27.124 --> 00:40:28.559 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE KIDS WHO ARE BEING TESTED

00:40:28.626 --> 00:40:29.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DOES THAT MEAN WE NEED TO DO

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:33.798 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
MORE WITH FREE CLINICS OR.

00:40:33.864 --> 00:40:35.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I THINK THAT M. INNER SPIRIT

00:40:35.866 --> 00:40:37.101 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I'VE WORKED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

00:40:37.168 --> 00:40:38.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOR TEN YEARS BEFORE COMING TO

00:40:39.036 --> 00:40:39.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE STATE AND I WILL SAY THAT

00:40:39.937 --> 00:40:41.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE. YOU SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF

00:40:42.039 --> 00:40:43.240 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE CHILDHOOD LEAD PREVENTION

00:40:43.307 --> 00:40:45.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PROGRAM AND AND I I DO ACTUALLY

00:40:45.376 --> 00:40:46.777 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE WITH THE

00:40:46.844 --> 00:40:47.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CHILD HEALTH AND DISABILITY

00:40:47.411 --> 00:40:48.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
PROGRAM.

00:40:48.179 --> 00:40:50.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THEY WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH WITH

00:40:50.881 --> 00:40:53.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CLINICS PARTICULARLY FQHCS AND

00:40:53.284 --> 00:40:53.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
OTHER.

00:40:53.918 --> 00:40:55.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CLINICS IN COMMUNITIES THAT

00:40:55.653 --> 00:40:56.587 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
REALLY REACH THESE MOST

00:40:56.654 --> 00:40:58.656 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND THEY

00:40:58.722 --> 00:41:00.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DO A VERY GOOD JOB OF MAKING THE

00:41:01.025 --> 00:41:03.294 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
CLINICIANS AWARE OF LEAD
TESTING.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THERE ARE SOME BARRIERS BUT

00:41:05.596 --> 00:41:07.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THERE ARE BARRIERS WITHIN THE

00:41:07.164 --> 00:41:08.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
SYSTEM SO FOR EXAMPLE.

00:41:08.899 --> 00:41:10.968 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IN MANY CLINICS POINT OF CARE

00:41:11.035 --> 00:41:12.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
LEAD TESTING SO THE KIND OF

00:41:12.636 --> 00:41:15.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TESTING OR MUNICIPALITY. A SMALL

00:41:15.306 --> 00:41:16.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TEST AT WHAT SITES ARE NOT

00:41:16.774 --> 00:41:18.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AVAILABLE AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS

00:41:18.943 --> 00:41:20.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT THAT FAMILY THEN HAS TO GO

00:41:20.811 --> 00:41:22.346 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TO A BLOOD COLLECTION SITE

00:41:22.413 --> 00:41:25.382 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ACTUALLY STAY GET THE TOSSED

00:41:25.449 --> 00:41:27.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEY MAY HAVE TO PAY A CO PAY.

00:41:27.651 --> 00:41:29.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THE EACH STEP REMOVED THAT

00:41:29.587 --> 00:41:31.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU ARE IS A STEP THAT CREATES A

00:41:31.522 --> 00:41:32.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BARRIER AND THAT'S TRUE FOR ANY

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:33.357 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
KIND OF.

00:41:33.424 --> 00:41:35.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TESTING THAT REQUIRES A BLOOD

00:41:35.092 --> 00:41:36.994 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DRAW AND THAT MAY BE ONE OF THE

00:41:37.061 --> 00:41:38.362 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AREAS WERE RELEASING SOME

00:41:38.429 --> 00:41:39.597 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
CHILDREN AS WELL.

00:41:39.663 --> 00:41:41.332 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SO ARM WOULD YOU SUGGEST IT

00:41:41.398 --> 00:41:42.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA IF WE COULD

00:41:42.867 --> 00:41:44.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DO AT LEAST A SCREENING TEST

00:41:44.969 --> 00:41:46.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHEN THE CHILDREN ARE GETTING

00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:50.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
THEIR CHECKUPS.

00:41:50.341 --> 00:41:51.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I YOU KNOW IT TO PI DON'T KNOW

00:41:52.042 --> 00:41:53.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ENOUGH ABOUT THE STATE OF THE

00:41:53.143 --> 00:41:54.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ART OF POINT OF CARE LEAD

00:41:54.612 --> 00:41:56.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TESTING THERE HAVE BEEN THERE

00:41:56.447 --> 00:41:58.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ARE TECHNOLOGIES AVAILABLE MY

00:41:58.148 --> 00:41:59.350 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THEY ARE

00:41:59.416 --> 00:42:00.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
IN FACT.

00:42:00.951 --> 00:42:02.720 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SOME ARE DEVELOPING IN THAT.

00:42:02.786 --> 00:42:04.321 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RECENTLY THAT WAS OF SOME OF THE

00:42:04.388 --> 00:42:06.090 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TECHNOLOGY THAT'S AVAILABLE HAS

00:42:06.156 --> 00:42:07.191 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ACTUALLY BEEN CALLED INTO

00:42:07.258 --> 00:42:08.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
QUESTION AS FAR OF ITS AS FAR AS

00:42:08.893 --> 00:42:10.828 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ITS ACCURACY GOES IN AND SO

00:42:10.895 --> 00:42:12.663 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WITHOUT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:14.131 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S AVAILABLE

00:42:14.198 --> 00:42:16.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I WOULD HESITATE. HESITATE TO

00:42:16.467 --> 00:42:18.302 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CALL FOR A BROAD ADOPTION OF

00:42:18.369 --> 00:42:19.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
POINT OF CARE TESTING COULD YOU

00:46:47.437 --> 00:46:48.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
VERSUS THOSE WHO ARE

00:46:49.006 --> 00:46:49.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
CONTINUOUSLY ENROLLED IN

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:51.775 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
MEDICARE WILL?

00:46:51.842 --> 00:46:54.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE NUMBERS ARE VERY DIFFERENT.

00:46:54.578 --> 00:46:56.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FOR TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE

00:46:56.213 --> 00:46:57.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NUMBER TESTED WERE TWO HUNDRED

00:46:58.048 --> 00:46:59.616 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
TWENTY ONE THOUSAND.

00:46:59.683 --> 00:47:01.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE NUMBER AND ROLLED WERE SEVEN

00:47:01.084 --> 00:47:03.253 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN GIVING US A

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:05.022 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TWENTY EIGHT POINT ONE PERCENT.

00:47:05.088 --> 00:47:06.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT WERE ACTUALLY TESTED.

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:09.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:13.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SO AGAIN I AM WHERE WERE WE.

00:47:13.297 --> 00:47:14.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
I'M GONNA DEFER TO.

00:47:14.898 --> 00:47:17.801 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
JEN CAN'T WE DEAL WITH I'M THE

00:47:17.868 --> 00:47:20.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ACTUAL LABORATORY TESTS SO WE

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:21.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
HAVE THE END OF THE PROCESS

00:47:21.972 --> 00:47:23.941 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I'M RATHER THAN WHAT WE'RE
WHICH.

00:47:24.007 --> 00:47:27.411 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HEALTH INSURER THE CHILD IS IS

00:47:27.477 --> 00:47:30.080 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
SADDAM IS INSURED BY.

00:47:30.147 --> 00:47:31.682 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHAT EVERY SINGLE LABORATORY

00:47:31.748 --> 00:47:34.785 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TEST DONE FOR LOUD FOR EVERYONE

00:47:34.851 --> 00:47:36.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IN CALIFORNIA COMES THROUGH OUR?

00:47:36.353 --> 00:47:38.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SYSTEM AND SO WHEN WE MET WHEN

00:47:38.388 --> 00:47:39.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE MAKE ESTIMATES AND THEY ARE

00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:41.124 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ESTIMATES AGAIN WE DON'T GOT

00:47:41.191 --> 00:47:42.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
FAMILY INCOME LEVEL.

00:47:42.693 --> 00:47:45.462 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE USE WHAT WE HAVE FROM CENSUS

00:47:45.529 --> 00:47:47.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DATA AND THE NUMBER OF SO WE

00:47:47.331 --> 00:47:48.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MAKE AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT THE

00:47:48.131 --> 00:47:50.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TOTAL POPULATION IS USING U. S.

00:47:50.267 --> 00:47:52.302 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CENSUS DATA. AND WE KNOW HOW

00:47:52.369 --> 00:47:52.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
MANY.

00:47:53.036 --> 00:47:54.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SAMPLES WE RECEIVE FROM KIDS IN

00:47:55.005 --> 00:47:56.940 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE APPROPRIATE AGE RANGE AND

00:47:57.007 --> 00:47:58.442 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT'S HOW WE MAKE OUR ESTIMATES

00:47:58.508 --> 00:48:00.811 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF THE NUMBER OF ANTICIPATED

00:48:00.877 --> 00:48:02.379 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
CHILDREN IN POVERTY IN

00:48:02.446 --> 00:48:04.314 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CALIFORNIA UNDER TWO HUNDRED

00:48:04.381 --> 00:48:05.849 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FIFTY PERCENT OF PART OF. THE

00:48:05.916 --> 00:48:07.551 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL ARE BEING

00:48:07.618 --> 00:48:09.219 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TESTED AND IT'S BASED ON LEAD

00:48:09.286 --> 00:48:11.388 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TEST RESULTS. I DON'T I DON'T.

00:48:11.455 --> 00:48:13.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
REALLY HAVE I NEITHER HAVE

00:48:13.223 --> 00:48:15.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ACCESS TO NOR UNDERSTAND THE

00:48:15.092 --> 00:48:16.293 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
MEDICAL DATA.

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:18.095 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
SO I WILL I KNOW THAT.

00:48:18.495 --> 00:48:19.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THIS KENSHIN TENDS TO TALK

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:22.432 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ABOUT IT AND IF I COULD CLARIFY.

00:48:22.499 --> 00:48:23.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OUR NUMBERS ARE INDIVIDUAL

00:48:23.834 --> 00:48:25.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
CHILDREN TESTED.

00:48:25.969 --> 00:48:27.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SO IF A CHILD GETS TO BLOOD

00:48:27.738 --> 00:48:28.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BLOOD TESTS THAT WERE ONLY

00:48:28.772 --> 00:48:30.340 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
COUNTING THEM ONCE.

00:48:30.407 --> 00:48:31.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
SO IT'S A D. DUPLICATED

00:48:31.141 --> 00:48:33.443 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
INFORMATION.

00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:38.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE PROCESS THAT WE DO MANUALLY.

00:48:38.148 --> 00:48:39.583 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO THE QUESTION IS THEN SHOULD

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:42.152 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BE REFERRED TO NEXT HANNAFORD

00:48:42.219 --> 00:48:43.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
CAN'T CONCERT.

00:48:43.954 --> 00:48:45.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ULTIMATELY I THINK THAT.

00:48:45.322 --> 00:48:48.325 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IF IF WE HAD DATA SYSTEMS THAT

00:48:48.392 --> 00:48:50.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WOULD ALLOW US TO TO ACTUALLY

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:51.695 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
DIRECTLY.

00:48:51.762 --> 00:48:54.698 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OUT COMPARED THE MEDICAL DATA

00:48:54.765 --> 00:48:57.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND YOU KNOW SORT OF. REALLY.

00:48:57.267 --> 00:48:59.403 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RUN ANALYSES ON THE TWO SYSTEMS

00:48:59.469 --> 00:49:01.672 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TOGETHER WE WOULD BE ABLE TO

00:49:01.738 --> 00:49:02.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
PROVIDE MUCH MORE.

00:49:03.006 --> 00:49:04.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ACCURATE DATA RATHER THAN

00:49:04.975 --> 00:49:06.276 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ESTIMATING BUT AT THIS TIME WE

00:49:06.343 --> 00:49:08.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
JUST DON'T HAVE THAT TECHNOLOGY.

00:49:08.612 --> 00:49:09.513 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
WOULD YOU AGREE THAT.

00:49:09.579 --> 00:49:11.481 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

00:49:11.548 --> 00:49:12.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
TEST

00:49:12.849 --> 00:49:14.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
CHILDREN.

00:49:14.818 --> 00:49:16.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOR LED ABSOLUTELY AND WOULD YOU

00:49:16.853 --> 00:49:18.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AGREE THAT THE CHILDREN FROM LOW

00:49:18.955 --> 00:49:20.791 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
INCOME THAT THE COME FROM LOW

00:49:20.857 --> 00:49:21.992 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INCOME FAMILIES. ARE AT A HIGHER

00:49:22.059 --> 00:49:23.393 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
RISK

00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:25.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF LEAD POISONING YES THAT'S

00:49:25.896 --> 00:49:27.664 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EXACTLY WHAT WE PRIORITIZE THAT

00:49:27.731 --> 00:49:29.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
POPULATION AND I THINK THAT IT

00:49:29.433 --> 00:49:31.068 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EL ALONG THOSE LINES THEM TO THE

00:49:31.134 --> 00:49:34.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CHILDREN THAT ARE LOW INCOME.

00:49:34.137 --> 00:49:35.906 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ARE USUALLY ON MEDI CAL AND

00:49:35.972 --> 00:49:37.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:38.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
REQUIREMENT THEM THAT THEY BE

00:49:38.542 --> 00:49:40.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
TESTED.

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:42.179 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WE AGREE YES SHOULD THEY BE

00:49:42.245 --> 00:49:43.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TESTED ONCE OR SHOULD THINK THEY

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:45.649 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
BE TESTED MORE THAN ONCE

00:49:45.716 --> 00:49:47.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WELL THE REQUIREMENT IS FORTY.

00:49:47.284 --> 00:49:49.152 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOR TESTING BOTH A AT SIX MONTHS

00:49:49.219 --> 00:49:51.521 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND AT TWELVE MONTHS AND SO DOT

00:49:51.588 --> 00:49:53.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DOT IS WHAT OUR RECOMMENDATION

00:49:53.256 --> 00:49:54.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
WOULD BE.

00:49:54.157 --> 00:49:58.128 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
VERY GOOD.

00:49:58.195 --> 00:49:59.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PART OF THE REASON THAT THAT OF

00:49:59.296 --> 00:50:01.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
A FOR MY GREAT INTEREST AS.

00:50:01.965 --> 00:50:03.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CHAIRMAN KNOWS I I DID INTRODUCE

00:50:03.867 --> 00:50:06.002 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO

00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:07.471 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE WE WERE

00:50:07.537 --> 00:50:09.005 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
FINDING THAT MANY OF OUR

00:50:09.072 --> 00:50:11.575 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CHILDREN. WERE NOT BEING TESTED.

00:50:11.641 --> 00:50:13.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE IT WAS

00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:14.578 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REQUIRED THAT THE THAT THEY BE

00:50:14.644 --> 00:50:16.680 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TESTED WE'RE FINDING BECAUSE OF

00:50:16.747 --> 00:50:18.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE STATISTICS THAT WAS NOT

00:50:18.081 --> 00:50:20.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
HAPPENING.

00:50:21.051 --> 00:50:21.551 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND IF I COULD MAKE ONE MORE

00:50:21.618 --> 00:50:22.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
COMMENT.

00:50:22.919 --> 00:50:24.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OUR NUMBER IS PROBABLY A LOW

00:50:24.221 --> 00:50:25.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
NUMBER.

00:50:25.956 --> 00:50:27.691 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BECAUSE WHAT OUR NUMBERS ARE AS

00:50:27.758 --> 00:50:28.759 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE BLOOD LEAD TESTS THAT ARE

00:50:28.825 --> 00:50:30.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
REPORTED TO US.

00:50:30.727 --> 00:50:32.329 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SO IF THERE'S ANY ABSENCE OF

00:50:32.396 --> 00:50:34.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REPORTING OR ANY PATCHES THAT'S

00:50:34.331 --> 00:50:35.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
NOT REPORTED ARE ARE NUMBERS

00:50:36.032 --> 00:50:37.367 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WOULD BE YOU KNOW SO IN OTHER

00:50:37.434 --> 00:50:38.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WORDS A RATHER THAN IT BEING

00:50:38.869 --> 00:50:40.871 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OVERESTIMATE. I WOULD THINK IT

00:50:40.937 --> 00:50:44.674 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
TENDS TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF
LOVE.

00:50:44.741 --> 00:50:46.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WELL WE ALL AGREE THEIR CHILDREN

00:50:46.376 --> 00:50:48.178 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU SHOULD BE TESTED WHO ARE NOT

00:50:48.245 --> 00:50:50.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SELL THAT THAT WE CAN AGREE ON.

00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:53.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:54.818 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I AND THE. OTHER ANY OTHER

00:50:54.885 --> 00:50:56.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
QUESTIONS

00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:57.654 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BEFORE I STE AYE I HAVE I ALWAYS

00:50:57.721 --> 00:50:59.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
HAVE MORE QUESTIONS.

00:50:59.356 --> 00:51:01.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:51:01.124 --> 00:51:03.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IT DEPICTED GEOGRAPHICAL DATA

00:51:03.727 --> 00:51:05.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHEN YOU GET THE RESULTS OF THE

00:51:05.228 --> 00:51:07.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
TEST AND YES WE DO.

00:51:07.697 --> 00:51:09.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT I WATCHED CHICAGO DATA WHOM

00:51:09.666 --> 00:51:11.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE HAVE ADDRESS DATA WE HAVE TO

00:51:11.067 --> 00:51:13.303 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOLLOW THESE CHILDREN SO WE WE

00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:14.971 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND CHECK IT OUT TRUST INTO FARM

00:51:15.038 --> 00:51:16.907 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IT DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO FIND.

00:51:16.973 --> 00:51:18.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE

00:51:18.074 --> 00:51:19.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
PARTICULARLY.

00:51:20.277 --> 00:51:22.446 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
IN DANGER OF HAVING THAT

00:51:22.512 --> 00:51:22.979 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%

00:51:25.282 --> 00:51:27.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN A WITH THE APPROPRIATE DATA

00:51:27.117 --> 00:51:29.186 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SYSTEMS WE DO DO GEO MAPPING WE

00:51:29.252 --> 00:51:31.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
COULD DO JAIL MAPPING I DON'T

00:51:31.188 --> 00:51:33.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
KNOW JUST THE SYSTEM A LOT. AND

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:35.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WE DO HAVE DONE ZIP CODE.

00:51:35.125 --> 00:51:36.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AREAS IT'S ACTUALLY POSTED ON

00:51:36.793 --> 00:51:38.028 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OUR WEBSITE TO SHOW THE ZIP

00:51:38.094 --> 00:51:40.063 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
CODES THAT HAVE A HIGHER

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:41.598 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PERCENTAGE OF VERY GOOD CHILDREN

00:51:41.665 --> 00:51:43.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN. I'M

00:51:43.166 --> 00:51:43.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
INCREASED.

00:51:43.467 --> 00:51:44.634 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:51:44.701 --> 00:51:46.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
BUT.

00:51:47.003 --> 00:51:47.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WITH ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED

00:51:47.971 --> 00:51:49.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THOUSAND BLOOD LEAD TEST COMING

00:51:49.739 --> 00:51:51.608 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
IN EACH YEAR.

00:51:51.675 --> 00:51:51.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
AND.

00:51:51.875 --> 00:51:53.610 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SOME OF THESE TESTS ABOUT

00:51:53.677 --> 00:51:55.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FIFTEEN PERCENT OR SO LACK

00:51:55.712 --> 00:51:57.714 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COMPLETE ADDRESSES SO WE HAVE TO

00:51:57.781 --> 00:51:59.216 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WORK WITH THE LAB TO GET IT.

00:51:59.282 --> 00:52:01.485 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SOME OF THE MAPPING IT IS NOT SO

00:52:01.551 --> 00:52:02.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ACCURATE FOR THE DENOMINATOR SO

00:52:02.919 --> 00:52:03.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WITHIN MY BLOOD LEAD LEVEL WE

00:52:04.054 --> 00:52:05.555 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WORK REALLY HARD TO FIND THAT

00:52:05.622 --> 00:52:06.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
CHILD TO GET SERVICES.

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:07.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT IT'S A VERY LOW BLOOD LEAD

00:52:08.024 --> 00:52:08.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LEVEL THAT WOULD JUST BE THE

00:52:08.925 --> 00:52:10.494 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DENOMINATOR CHILDREN TESTED IN

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:12.362 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT AREA. IT THEY THEY MAY NOT

00:52:12.429 --> 00:52:14.331 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
QUITE GET THE. THE THE RESEARCH

00:52:14.397 --> 00:52:15.765 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ATTENTION BUT WE'RE WORKING ON

00:52:15.832 --> 00:52:16.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
IT AND.

00:52:17.234 --> 00:52:20.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
A GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM

00:52:20.103 --> 00:52:21.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IS PART OF WHAT WE'RE DEVELOPING

00:52:21.805 --> 00:52:23.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WITH OUR DATABASE NOW. SO THAT'S

00:52:23.073 --> 00:52:24.641 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EXCELLENT BECAUSE WHO WOULD BE

00:52:24.708 --> 00:52:27.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
VERY GOOD IF WE COULD LET

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:28.478 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
PEDIATRICIANS NO.

00:52:28.545 --> 00:52:30.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ARE WHAT AREAS THEY SHOULD

00:52:30.914 --> 00:52:34.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PARTICULARLY LOOK OUT FOR.

00:52:34.184 --> 00:52:35.452 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ALRIGHT ALAMEDA COUNTY HAVE ONE

00:52:35.519 --> 00:52:38.388 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
MORE QUESTION.

00:52:38.455 --> 00:52:41.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO ARM YOU HAVE THIS THEIR BLOOD

00:52:41.324 --> 00:52:44.761 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
LEVEL TRACKING SYSTEM ARE
RASCAL.

00:52:44.828 --> 00:52:46.363 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
AND THAT HOW WAS THAT.

00:52:46.429 --> 00:52:48.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PROGRAM COMING ALONG WENDY

00:52:48.732 --> 00:52:49.032 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
THINK KILL HAVE.

.

00:52:50.734 --> 00:52:53.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OF IMPROVE DATABASE SO CHAU

00:52:53.103 --> 00:52:54.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
RASCAL WHICH STANDS FOR THE

00:52:54.738 --> 00:52:56.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RESPONSE AND SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM

00:52:56.239 --> 00:52:58.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FOR CHILD AND LEAD EXPOSURE.

00:52:58.375 --> 00:52:58.942 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MAYBE MORE THAN YOU WANTED TO

00:52:59.009 --> 00:53:01.611 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
KNOW. WAS THAT A DATA SYSTEM

00:53:01.678 --> 00:53:03.313 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT WAS DEVELOPED ALMOST TWENTY

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:04.114 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
YEARS AGO.

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:05.849 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND RECEIVES ALL THE BLOOD THE

00:53:05.916 --> 00:53:07.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TEST WE'VE TALKED ABOUT GETS

00:53:07.284 --> 00:53:09.819 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
INFORMATION ABOUT CASES
DETECTOR.

00:53:09.886 --> 00:53:11.354 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SO WE ARE LOOKING NOW AT IT

00:53:11.421 --> 00:53:12.722 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
UPGRADING IT TO MODERN

00:53:12.789 --> 00:53:13.823 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TECHNOLOGY AND TO DO THESE

00:53:13.890 --> 00:53:15.959 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT. THE NEW

00:53:16.026 --> 00:53:17.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SYSTEMS CAN BE CALLED SHIELD.

00:53:17.794 --> 00:53:19.029 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I'M JUST TO DISTINGUISH AT ITS

TOOK RASCAL AND USED IT FOR WHAT

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:31.408 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT DISSEMINATED AROUND THE THE

00:53:31.474 --> 00:53:33.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NATION I'M YEARS AGO AFTER WE

00:53:33.176 --> 00:53:35.045 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DEVELOPED IT. AND SO IT SERVED

IT CUT ABOUT DIABETES THERE'S A

01:00:26.122 --> 01:00:27.390 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
LOT OF DIFFERENT CLINICAL.

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:29.492 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
MEASURES AND METRICS THAT WE
USE.

01:00:29.559 --> 01:00:30.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND COMMUNICATING WITH THE

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:32.095 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PLANS AS WELL AS THE PROVIDERS

01:00:32.161 --> 01:00:34.564 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
DOWN BELOW.

01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:36.332 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHEN PROVIDER SEE A CHILD IN

01:00:36.399 --> 01:00:37.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
MEDI CAL.

01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:40.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEY WILL BILL AN ENCOUNTER TO

01:00:41.037 --> 01:00:42.305 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE HEALTH PLAN SAID THIS IS A

01:00:42.372 --> 01:00:44.507 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PHYSICIAN THAT HAS A CHILD IN

01:00:44.574 --> 01:00:46.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THEIR OFFICE AND THEY'RE DOING A

01:00:46.175 --> 01:00:48.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WELL CHILD VISIT. AND THEY MAY

01:00:48.144 --> 01:00:49.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BE DOING A VARIETY OF THINGS.

01:00:49.645 --> 01:00:51.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
FOR THAT CHILD AT THAT

01:00:51.881 --> 01:00:53.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PARTICULAR VISIT ONE OF WHICH

01:00:53.783 --> 01:00:55.284 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MAY BE A BLOOD LEAD SCREENING

01:00:55.351 --> 01:00:57.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE

01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:58.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THINK PERHAPS SOME OF THE STATE

01:00:58.855 --> 01:00:59.489 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
THAT IS AND SUCH.

01:00:59.555 --> 01:01:02.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:01:02.091 --> 01:01:04.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IT AND IT'S A IT'S NOT MATCHING

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:05.628 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
UP WITH WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:01:05.695 --> 01:01:07.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
PUBLIC HEALTH IS. THAT.

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:10.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PROVIDER MADE DO THE SCREENING

01:01:10.099 --> 01:01:11.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT THEY SIMPLY MAY NOT REPORT

01:01:11.567 --> 01:01:13.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
THAT TESTS

01:01:13.202 --> 01:01:14.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO THE HEALTH PLAN WHICH IS ARE

01:01:14.771 --> 01:01:17.540 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MEAN AGGREGATOR OF SUCH DATA.

01:01:17.607 --> 01:01:23.179 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO IF YOU'RE A PROVIDER AND YOU

01:01:23.246 --> 01:01:24.080 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARE SEEN THOSE PATIENTS AND ALL

01:01:24.147 --> 01:01:24.714 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU'RE DOING IS SUBMITTING WHAT

01:01:24.781 --> 01:01:25.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE CALL AN ENCOUNTER TO THE PLAN

01:01:26.015 --> 01:01:27.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IT BASICALLY TELLS THE PLAN I

01:01:27.717 --> 01:01:29.519 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SAW THIS CHILD FOR WELL CHILD

01:01:29.585 --> 01:01:31.587 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
VISIT. AND SO THE PLAN REPORTS

01:01:31.654 --> 01:01:32.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT WELL CHILD VISIT TO US BUT

01:01:32.989 --> 01:01:34.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT MAY NOT INCLUDE ALL THE SUB

01:01:34.924 --> 01:01:36.059 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
COMPLIMENTS OF WHAT THAT

01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:38.161 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PROVIDER. GAVE ARE PERFORMED ON

01:01:38.227 --> 01:01:40.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT CHILD SO THAT'S ONE KIND OF

01:01:40.463 --> 01:01:41.931 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
KEY AREA WHERE WE THINK THE DATA

01:01:41.998 --> 01:01:43.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IS PROBABLY NOT AS GOOD AS WE

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.234 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
WOULD LIKE IT TO BE.

01:01:45.301 --> 01:01:47.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
THERE WERE.

01:01:47.303 --> 01:01:48.805 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
CHANGES MADE.

01:01:48.871 --> 01:01:51.674 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO A FORM THAT WE USE TO USE

01:01:51.741 --> 01:01:54.310 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT WAS A PAPER BASED AND.

01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:57.547 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CARBON TRIPLICATE FORM AND IT

01:01:57.613 --> 01:01:59.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WAS CALLED THE PM ONE SIXTY.

01:01:59.248 --> 01:02:01.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
IT'S GONE AWAY IT WASN'T

01:02:01.284 --> 01:02:02.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
COMPLIANT WITH A LOT OF

01:02:02.685 --> 01:02:04.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE IN

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:05.621 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TODAY'S WORLD AROUND HEALTH

01:02:05.688 --> 01:02:07.757 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND

01:02:07.824 --> 01:02:09.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PRIVACY AND IT DIDN'T ACTUALLY

01:02:09.358 --> 01:02:10.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
FIT INTO ANY KIND OF.

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:13.496 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I TEAR AUTOMATED SYSTEM AND SO

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:15.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE HAVE PHASED OUT THE PM ONE

01:02:15.431 --> 01:02:17.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SIXTY BUT WHAT THAT DOCUMENT AND

01:02:17.433 --> 01:02:18.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WITHOUT FORM USED TO DO FOR US

01:02:18.968 --> 01:02:20.436 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WAS THAT WAS KIND OF ONE OF THE

01:02:20.503 --> 01:02:22.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WAYS THAT PROVIDERS INDICATED

01:02:22.405 --> 01:02:24.040 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT THEY HAD DONE A CHILD LED.

01:02:24.107 --> 01:02:26.375 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SCREENING ON A CHILD SO THEY CAN

01:02:26.442 --> 01:02:28.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
VOLUNTARILY PROVIDE THAT

01:02:28.211 --> 01:02:29.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
INFORMATION BUT THEY'RE NOT

01:02:29.545 --> 01:02:31.447 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MANDATED TO PROVIDE IT AND SO

01:02:31.514 --> 01:02:33.249 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THERE'S NOT ALWAYS A FAIL SAFE

01:02:33.316 --> 01:02:35.351 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WAY TO CAPTURE AN ACCOUNT FOR

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:36.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

01:02:36.152 --> 01:02:37.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PROVISION OF SERVICE AND SO WE

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THINK THAT THAT IS PROBABLY ONE

01:02:39.222 --> 01:02:40.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
AREA.

01:02:40.323 --> 01:02:42.191 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN WHICH WERE NOT GETTING A LOT

01:02:42.258 --> 01:02:43.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OF COMPLIANCE AND WITH THE

01:02:43.893 --> 01:02:45.094 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PROVIDER COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY IF

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:46.596 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THEY'RE NOT BEING. PAID TO

01:02:46.662 --> 01:02:48.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PROVIDE SOME OF THESE PIECES OF

01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:49.432 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DATA RIGHT THEY IF THEY'RE LIKE

01:02:49.499 --> 01:02:50.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
I'M GETTING.

01:02:50.633 --> 01:02:51.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU KNOW FIFTY DOLLARS FOR THIS

01:02:51.934 --> 01:02:54.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EXAM BUT I'M NOT GOING TO BE

01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:56.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
REIMBURSED FOR THE TIME SPENT

01:02:56.139 --> 01:02:57.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
YOU KNOW FILLING OUT A

01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:59.075 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
VACCINATION RECORD OR FILLING

01:02:59.142 --> 01:02:59.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
OUT OF.

01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:01.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
YOU KNOW A SPORTS CLEARANCE

01:03:01.744 --> 01:03:03.312 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AURA LED SCREENING OR SOMETHING

01:03:03.379 --> 01:03:04.480 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
LIKE THAT WE MAY THEY MAY

01:03:04.547 --> 01:03:05.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PERFORM ALL THOSE THINGS BUT WE

01:03:05.681 --> 01:03:07.416 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MAY JUST NOT SEE THE APPROPRIATE

01:03:07.483 --> 01:03:08.718 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
KIND OF DOCUMENTATION AND PAPER

01:03:08.784 --> 01:03:10.620 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
WORK AROUND THAT.

01:03:10.686 --> 01:03:12.388 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY.

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:14.123 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ON SOME OF THE DATA IS THAT WE

01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:16.192 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
KNOW ON HOW MANY CHILDREN WE

01:03:16.259 --> 01:03:18.094 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAVE AND MEDI CAL AND WHAT I

01:03:18.161 --> 01:03:19.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THINK WAS AND VERY TELLING WHEN

01:03:19.729 --> 01:03:20.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WE WERE WORKING WITH THE

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:21.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:22.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHICH WE WORK WITH I'M QUITE

01:03:22.965 --> 01:03:24.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CLOSELY AT IT. IN PARTICULAR

01:03:24.767 --> 01:03:26.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HISTORICALLY ON THIS PROGRAM IS

01:03:26.736 --> 01:03:27.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THEY.

01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:28.871 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARE VERY ACCURATE WHEN THEY SAY

01:03:28.938 --> 01:03:31.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THEY SEE THE END OF THE PIPELINE

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:33.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO THEY KNOW HOW MANY CHILDREN

01:03:33.376 --> 01:03:34.777 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WERE TESTED BECAUSE THEY'RE SEEN

01:03:34.844 --> 01:03:37.313 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE ACTUAL LAB TESTING DATA. WE

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:38.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
ARE SEEN.

01:03:38.414 --> 01:03:40.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SOME OF THE DATA ON THE FRONT

01:03:40.116 --> 01:03:42.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ENDS MEANING THE PROVIDER HAS.

01:03:43.085 --> 01:03:44.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SCREEN THE CHILD BUT THEN THE

01:03:45.054 --> 01:03:47.123 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

THERE WAS AND I DON'T KNOW THAT

01:05:18.681 --> 01:05:19.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE COMMITTEE WAS AWARE OF THAT

01:05:20.049 --> 01:05:20.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
THERE WAS.

WE HAVE WE HAVE AND WE ARE A

01:05:35.831 --> 01:05:36.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
STATE THAT DOES UNIVERSAL

01:05:36.966 --> 01:05:38.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
SCREENING.

01:05:38.067 --> 01:05:39.302 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

TARGETED SCREENING IS MORE

01:05:45.408 --> 01:05:47.209 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
APPROPRIATE AYE EE.

01:05:47.276 --> 01:05:48.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
YOU DON'T HAVE TO

01:05:48.377 --> 01:05:49.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SCREEN EVERY CHILD BUT YOU HAVE

01:05:50.012 --> 01:05:51.414 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO JUST SCREEN CHILD CHILDREN IN

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.782 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CERTAIN AREAS WHERE YOU BELIEVE

01:05:52.848 --> 01:05:53.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
THAT THERE'S A HIGH

01:05:53.282 --> 01:05:54.850 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PREPONDERANCE OF FLAT OR IN

01:05:54.917 --> 01:05:56.852 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CERTAIN POPULATIONS. THEY LEFT

01:05:56.919 --> 01:05:58.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
IT OPEN TO THE STATE'S.

01:05:58.321 --> 01:06:00.489 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND WE AS A STATE HAVE NOT

01:06:00.556 --> 01:06:01.924 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CHANGED OUR UNIVERSAL SCREENING

01:06:01.991 --> 01:06:04.126 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
APPROACH BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS

01:06:04.193 --> 01:06:05.094 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

01:06:05.161 --> 01:06:07.997 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OTHER PAYERS MEANING PRIVATE

01:06:08.064 --> 01:06:10.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COMMERCIAL INSURANCE AND OTHER.

01:06:10.466 --> 01:06:12.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SYSTEMS HAVE GONE TO TARGETED

01:06:12.835 --> 01:06:15.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SCREENING AND SO WE ALL USE THE

01:06:15.204 --> 01:06:16.305 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
SAME.

01:06:16.372 --> 01:06:18.541 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
DOCTORS AND SO THERE IS

01:06:18.607 --> 01:06:20.443 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
PROBABLY WE ASSUME SOME

01:06:20.509 --> 01:06:21.811 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
CONFUSION IN THE PROVIDER

01:06:21.877 --> 01:06:23.012 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
COMMUNITY WHICH IS DO WE DO

01:06:23.079 --> 01:06:24.714 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
UNIVERSAL SCREENING OR DO WE DO

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:26.015 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TARGETED SCREENING AND THEY'RE

01:06:26.082 --> 01:06:27.750 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GETTING CONFLICTING MESSAGES.

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:29.752 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
BOTH FROM US AS A PAYER.

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:31.654 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AS WELL AS FROM OTHER PEER

01:06:31.721 --> 01:06:33.055 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
GROUPS AND SO I WOULD JUST

01:06:33.122 --> 01:06:34.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STIPULATE THAT THAT ALSO IS KIND

01:06:34.590 --> 01:06:36.525 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OF OUT THERE IN THE. PROVIDER

01:06:36.592 --> 01:06:37.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF THEY'RE

01:06:37.593 --> 01:06:38.527 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
NOT QUITE SURE WHETHER THEY

SHOULD BE SCREENING EVERYONE OR

01:06:39.895 --> 01:06:41.397 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
IF THEY SHOULD ONLY BE.

01:06:41.464 --> 01:06:43.032 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SCREENING CHILDREN THAT HAVE

01:06:43.099 --> 01:06:44.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
CERTAIN RISK FACTORS.

01:06:44.266 --> 01:06:46.068 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%

YES THANK YOU.

01:07:15.097 --> 01:07:16.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT JUST THE

01:07:16.699 --> 01:07:18.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
LAST THING YOU WERE TALKING

01:07:18.134 --> 01:07:19.101 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ABOUT TARGETING SCREENING VERSES

01:07:19.168 --> 01:07:21.837 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
UNIVERSAL SCREENING.

01:07:21.904 --> 01:07:23.539 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EVEN IF WE TALK ABOUT TARGETING

01:07:23.606 --> 01:07:25.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
SCREENING.

01:07:25.241 --> 01:07:27.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WOULD YOU AGREE THAT. THOSE ON

01:07:27.376 --> 01:07:29.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MEDI CAL SHOULD BE TARGETED FOR

01:07:29.445 --> 01:07:31.881 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
THE SCREENING.

01:07:31.947 --> 01:07:33.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NO I THINK I MEAN THIS IS WHY WE

01:07:33.783 --> 01:07:35.351 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AS A STATE HAVE NOT CHANGED OUR

01:07:35.418 --> 01:07:36.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
APPROACH FROM UNIVERSAL

01:07:36.652 --> 01:07:37.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SCREENING THE TARGETED SCREENING

01:07:37.753 --> 01:07:38.621 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
IS I THINK THAT.

01:07:38.687 --> 01:07:41.157 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:07:41.223 --> 01:07:42.825 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A QUICK AND TO BE HONEST IN A

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:44.093 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
STATE AS LARGE.

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:46.028 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND IS KIND OF COMPLICATED AS

01:07:46.095 --> 01:07:47.897 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OURS IS I'M NOT EVEN SURE AND WE

01:07:47.963 --> 01:07:49.098 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CERTAINLY DON'T POSSESS THE

01:07:49.165 --> 01:07:49.965 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
CLINICAL.

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:52.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EXPERTISE FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL

01:07:52.835 --> 01:07:54.170 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STANDPOINT I DON'T KNOW HOW WE

01:07:54.236 --> 01:07:55.337 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AS A DEPARTMENT WOULD LOOK AT

01:07:55.404 --> 01:07:57.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CERTAIN EITHER GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

01:07:57.273 --> 01:07:58.574 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OF THE STATE AND SAY OH YES

01:07:58.641 --> 01:08:00.176 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
THESE ARE DEFINITELY PLACES
THAT.

01:08:00.242 --> 01:08:02.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SHOULD BE TARGETED OR THESE ARE

01:08:02.445 --> 01:08:04.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CERTAIN I'M HOUSING COMPLEXES

01:08:04.346 --> 01:08:06.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT SHOULD BE IDENTIFIED I

01:08:06.148 --> 01:08:08.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THINK WE FEEL THAT IS PROBABLY

01:08:08.117 --> 01:08:10.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
JUST SAFER ON THE NATURAL TO

01:08:10.519 --> 01:08:12.087 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
JUST ASSUME. THAT EVERYBODY

01:08:12.154 --> 01:08:13.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SHOULD BE SCREENED AND TO THE

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:15.558 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EXTENT THAT UNIVERSAL SCREENING.

01:08:15.624 --> 01:08:18.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HELPS IDENTIFY CERTAIN AREAS

01:08:18.127 --> 01:08:19.462 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SUCH AS WHAT PUBLIC HEALTH WAS

01:08:19.528 --> 01:08:20.729 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SAYING WE CAN YOU KNOW DRIVE

01:08:20.796 --> 01:08:21.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DOWN TO ZIP CODES AND WE CAN

01:08:21.897 --> 01:08:23.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
REALLY HONE IN ON. CHILDREN IN A

01:08:24.033 --> 01:08:25.401 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PARTICULAR AREA THAT ARE SHOWING

01:08:25.468 --> 01:08:26.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HIGH LEVELS OF LEAD IN THEIR

01:08:26.902 --> 01:08:27.603 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
BLOOD TESTS.

01:08:27.670 --> 01:08:30.005 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT'S GREAT BUT I THINK OUR

01:08:30.072 --> 01:08:31.240 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ATTITUDE IS IS WE WOULD PREFER

01:08:31.307 --> 01:08:32.675 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PROBABLY JUST TO STAY AT A

01:08:32.741 --> 01:08:34.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
UNIVERSAL SCREENING LEVEL AND

01:08:34.243 --> 01:08:35.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NOT ASSUME ANYTHING ESPECIALLY

01:08:36.011 --> 01:08:37.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
BECAUSE WE DON'T POSSESS.

01:08:37.847 --> 01:08:39.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SCIENTIFIC EXPERTISE ON HOW TO

01:08:39.949 --> 01:08:43.185 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
BETTER TARGET.

01:13:09.518 --> 01:13:11.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
WERE NOT TESTED.

01:13:11.153 --> 01:13:12.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE FACT THAT THEIR CHILDREN

01:13:12.321 --> 01:13:13.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WERE NOT TESTED WHAT DO YOU

01:13:13.989 --> 01:13:15.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
RECOMMEND THAT WE DO WHAT WHAT

01:13:16.024 --> 01:13:18.026 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SHOULD BE REQUIRED SO THAT WE

01:13:18.093 --> 01:13:18.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GET CLOSER TO THE ONE HUNDRED

01:13:18.927 --> 01:13:20.496 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
PERCENT.

01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:21.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IF TESTING OUR CHILDREN WELL I

01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:23.732 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
THINK YOU KNOW CERTAINLY WHAT
WE.

01:13:23.799 --> 01:13:25.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DETERMINED AFTER WORKING.

01:13:26.001 --> 01:13:27.536 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WITH BOTH YOUR STAFF AS WELL AS

01:13:27.603 --> 01:13:28.971 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
PUBLIC HEALTH IS THAT WE

01:13:29.037 --> 01:13:30.739 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OURSELVES ARE GONNA GO BACK TO

01:13:30.806 --> 01:13:33.008 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
THE PLANTS THAT WE CONTRACT
WITH.

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:33.709 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
AND.

01:13:33.776 --> 01:13:35.577 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DO A REVISION ON BOTH THE

01:13:35.644 --> 01:13:37.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
POLICY AND PROCEDURE RIGHT WHICH

01:13:37.212 --> 01:13:38.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IS YOU KNOW MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:40.682 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PLANS KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THIS

01:13:40.749 --> 01:13:42.684 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENT. WE ARE

01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:44.620 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GOING TO REVIEW THE ALL PLAN

01:13:44.686 --> 01:13:45.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LETTER IN THE GUIDANCE THAT WE

01:13:45.821 --> 01:13:47.089 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
GAVE TO THE PLANS.

01:13:47.156 --> 01:13:48.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SEVERAL YEARS AGO TO MAKE SURE

01:13:48.791 --> 01:13:50.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IT STILL BALLOT OBVIOUSLY A LOT

01:13:50.359 --> 01:13:51.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
HAS CHANGED.

01:13:51.894 --> 01:13:53.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND OUR PROGRAM UMB WITH THE

01:13:53.962 --> 01:13:55.197 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
EXPANSION.

01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:57.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND WE HAVE

01:13:57.366 --> 01:13:59.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
A MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT.

01:13:59.067 --> 01:14:01.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BENEFICIARY PARTICIPATION THAN

01:14:01.637 --> 01:14:02.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE DID BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND

01:14:03.005 --> 01:14:04.907 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TWO SO I THINK THIS WAS A GOOD.

01:14:04.973 --> 01:14:06.875 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BOTH REMINDER TO US TO GO BACK

01:14:06.942 --> 01:14:07.543 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
AND.

01:14:07.609 --> 01:14:10.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
RE REVIEWS SOME OF OUR BOTH

01:14:10.312 --> 01:14:11.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
GUIDANCE AND REQUIREMENTS

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:13.749 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I THINK IT WILL ALSO AND BE

01:14:13.816 --> 01:14:14.950 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO WORK

01:14:15.017 --> 01:14:15.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WITH PUBLIC HEALTH AND I KNOW

01:14:15.984 --> 01:14:17.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT AND DIRECTOR SMITH. ALSO

01:14:17.686 --> 01:14:19.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
REFERENCED IT IN TERMS OF MAKING

01:14:19.221 --> 01:14:20.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SURE THAT OUR DATA IS MAYBE

01:14:20.923 --> 01:14:22.191 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
BETTER.

01:14:22.257 --> 01:14:24.326 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
LINKS BECAUSE WE ARE WE ARE

01:14:24.393 --> 01:14:25.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
CLEARLY NOT COMPARING.

01:14:25.861 --> 01:14:27.729 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THE SAME NUMERATORS AND

01:14:27.796 --> 01:14:28.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DENOMINATORS RIGHT THEY HAVE A

01:14:28.897 --> 01:14:31.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
VERY DIFFERENT WAY OF HOW THEY.

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:33.035 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAVE A METHODOLOGY FOR HOW THEY

01:14:33.101 --> 01:14:34.336 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ASSUME THE LEVEL OF TESTING IN

01:14:34.403 --> 01:14:36.238 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CALIFORNIA AND I THINK YOU KNOW

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:42.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOUR YOU SHOULD DO BETTER AS TO

01:14:42.711 --> 01:14:43.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DEPARTMENTS TO SAY ALRIGHT LET'S

01:14:43.779 --> 01:14:44.980 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
PUT. YOUR TESTS.

01:14:45.047 --> 01:14:47.216 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DATA TOGETHER WITH OUR IN

01:14:47.282 --> 01:14:49.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ELIGIBILITY DATA AND LET'S SEE

01:14:49.651 --> 01:14:51.753 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EITHER WHAT THE OVERLAP IS OR.

01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:53.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IS THERE A BETTER WAY THAT WE

01:14:53.889 --> 01:14:55.324 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
CAN COMMUNICATE WITH.

01:14:55.390 --> 01:14:56.558 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PROVIDERS ARE CLINICS IN WHICH

01:14:56.625 --> 01:14:58.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THESE POPULATIONS ARE MOST

01:14:58.260 --> 01:14:59.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LIKELY TO BE SEEKING CARE TO

01:14:59.394 --> 01:15:00.462 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ENSURE THAT THEY KNOW WHAT

01:15:00.529 --> 01:15:01.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEY'RE DOING I THINK THE OTHER

01:15:01.530 --> 01:15:03.498 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THING IS. THERE'S A VARIETY OF

01:15:03.565 --> 01:15:05.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE WORK WITH

01:15:05.601 --> 01:15:06.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
AS WELL AS I'M WHAT THE

01:15:06.869 --> 01:15:08.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS

01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:10.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IN TERMS OF OUTREACH WITH.

01:15:10.138 --> 01:15:11.173 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
I'M LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
ORGANIZATIONS.

01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:14.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THE LEAD PIPE PREVENTION

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:16.078 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROGRAMS FIRST FIVE THERE'S A

01:15:16.144 --> 01:15:16.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
LOT OF DIFFERENT.

01:15:16.945 --> 01:15:19.114 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ENTITIES THAT WE CAN WORK WITH

01:15:19.181 --> 01:15:19.548 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
TO.

01:15:19.615 --> 01:15:21.250 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BOTH HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE

01:15:21.316 --> 01:15:21.717 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
ABOUT.

01:15:21.783 --> 01:15:23.252 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE SCREENING AND TESTING AS

01:15:23.318 --> 01:15:25.187 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WELL AS ENSURING THAT OUR

01:15:25.254 --> 01:15:26.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PROVIDERS KNOW THAT THIS IS AN

01:15:26.221 --> 01:15:27.522 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EXPECTATION ON THEM WHEN THEY

01:15:27.589 --> 01:15:28.390 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SEE THESE CHILDREN AT THE

01:15:28.457 --> 01:15:31.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CERTAIN PERIODICITY SCHEDULES.

01:15:31.493 --> 01:15:33.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THANK YOU. PLANET A VICE CHAIR

01:15:33.328 --> 01:15:35.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
CHEN.

01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:37.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

01:15:37.633 --> 01:15:39.801 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MY QUESTION IS SINCE THERE IS

01:15:39.868 --> 01:15:41.436 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
YOU KNOW A FINITE AMOUNT OF

01:15:41.503 --> 01:15:43.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
FINANCIAL RESOURCES.

01:15:43.138 --> 01:15:44.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND THOUGH I THINK UNIVERSAL

01:15:44.306 --> 01:15:45.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
TESTING IS

01:15:45.807 --> 01:15:47.776 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A GREAT WAY TO GO. IS IT MORE

01:15:47.843 --> 01:15:50.412 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EFFICIENT. AS A MORE SCIENTIFIC

01:15:50.479 --> 01:15:52.481 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IF WE HAD TESTING IN SPECIFIC

01:15:52.547 --> 01:15:54.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AREAS THAT YOU HAVE HOMES THAT

01:15:54.116 --> 01:15:55.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
ARE.

01:15:55.717 --> 01:15:57.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PRE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT THAT

01:15:57.552 --> 01:15:58.687 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DO HAVE AREAS IN WHICH THEY DO

01:15:58.754 --> 01:16:00.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NOT HAVE MUNICIPAL WATER LINES

01:16:00.856 --> 01:16:02.391 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ON THAT ARE A LOT MORE MUCH MORE

01:16:02.457 --> 01:16:04.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HIGHER ENTERS A LIKELIHOOD OF

01:16:04.593 --> 01:16:07.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAVING. THAT LED A ISSUES IF YOU

01:16:07.195 --> 01:16:08.430 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
WILL.

01:16:08.497 --> 01:16:09.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SUPPOSE OTHER NEWER COMMUNITIES

01:16:09.731 --> 01:16:11.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
THROUGHOUT OUR STATE.

01:16:11.533 --> 01:16:13.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
AND GIVEN THE FINANCIAL

01:16:13.268 --> 01:16:13.769 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE'RE IN

01:16:13.835 --> 01:16:15.871 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
RIGHT NOW.

01:16:15.938 --> 01:16:18.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO COUPLE THOUGHTS I'M ONE IS

01:16:18.073 --> 01:16:19.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT WOULD AND LIKE I SAID

01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:21.643 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EARLIER. WE DON'T NECESSARILY

01:16:21.710 --> 01:16:21.843 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
HAVE.

01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:23.779 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:16:23.845 --> 01:16:25.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
THE ENVIRONMENTAL.

01:16:25.347 --> 01:16:27.516 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FOR SCIENTIFIC EXPERTISE TO

01:16:27.582 --> 01:16:29.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
KIND OF DETERMINE WHAT THOSE.

01:16:29.184 --> 01:16:31.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HIGHER. PERCENTAGES PART PARTS

01:16:31.987 --> 01:16:33.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OF CALIFORNIA ARE IN TERMS OF

01:16:33.922 --> 01:16:36.124 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
HOUSING AND WE DO A LOT OF

01:16:36.191 --> 01:16:38.093 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THINGS BUT WE DON'T DO AS WELL

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:39.795 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
LEAD ASSESSMENTS VERY WELL

01:16:39.861 --> 01:16:41.363 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT'S NOT OUR OUR BODY OF.

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:43.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
EXPERTISE SO I WOULD.

01:16:43.231 --> 01:16:44.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE WOULD DESPERATELY NEED TO

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RELY ON SOMEONE ELSE TO BE ABLE

01:16:46.969 --> 01:16:48.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO HELP US DETERMINE IF WE WERE

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:50.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GOING TO TARGET WHAT WOULD THAT

01:16:50.205 --> 01:16:51.340 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
LOOK LIKE AND HOW WOULD WE DO
IT.

01:16:51.406 --> 01:16:53.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ON AS A MEDICAID PROGRAM IT'S AN

01:16:53.408 --> 01:16:55.610 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM WHICH MEANS

01:16:55.677 --> 01:16:57.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ANY BENEFICIARY THAT IS ENTITLED

01:16:57.679 --> 01:16:59.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO MEDICAID SERVICES RECEIVE

01:16:59.414 --> 01:17:00.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
THEM SO WE DON'T.

01:17:00.148 --> 01:17:01.883 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:02.484 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I DON'T THINK WE WOULD EVER

01:17:02.551 --> 01:17:04.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TARGET AND LIMIT SCREENINGS ONLY

01:17:04.987 --> 01:17:06.655 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO A CERTAIN POPULATION WITHIN

01:17:06.722 --> 01:17:08.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MEDICAID BECAUSE THAT'S NOT HOW

01:17:08.223 --> 01:17:10.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE OPERATE ANY OF THE SERVICES

01:17:10.125 --> 01:17:11.493 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
THAT WE HAVE TODAY.

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:12.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE ONLY OTHER THING I WOULD

01:17:12.961 --> 01:17:15.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SAY IS THAT WE PAY THE PLANS.

01:17:15.697 --> 01:17:16.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
AN ACTUARIAL.

01:17:18.166 --> 01:17:19.801 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
APPROVED AND BASED RATE FOR

PROCEDURES ARE DONE AND SO IT'S

01:25:51.212 --> 01:25:52.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN US AND

THESE ARE ALL.

01:25:56.150 --> 01:25:57.986 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT ON

THAT MAKE OUR WORK YOU KNOW BOTH

01:26:00.221 --> 01:26:01.222 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
VERY VALUABLE BUT ALSO

01:26:01.289 --> 01:26:03.892 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
CHALLENGING SOMETIMES.

01:26:03.958 --> 01:26:05.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I. WOULD APPRECIATE ALL THAT

STANDPOINT IN THAT RELATES TO A

01:26:13.868 --> 01:26:14.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES I THINK IS

01:26:15.036 --> 01:26:16.337 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. IN

01:26:16.404 --> 01:26:18.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ADDITION TO THAT I THINK THIS IS

01:26:18.072 --> 01:26:19.874 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A A NON PARTISAN ISSUE I THINK

01:26:19.941 --> 01:26:22.310 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE INVESTMENT IN THIS IS. A

01:26:22.377 --> 01:26:24.212 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND IS

01:26:24.279 --> 01:26:25.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GOING TO READ NOT WHEN TERMS OF.

01:26:25.713 --> 01:26:27.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PUBLIC POLICY REWARDS ON SOCIAL

NOW WHEN THE BUILDING IS DONE.

01:27:49.797 --> 01:27:52.567 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ARMED IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE

THE LAB BUT WE HAVE THE

01:28:21.963 --> 01:28:24.032 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MECHANICS IN PLACE WE THINK TO

01:28:24.098 --> 01:28:26.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DO THE DATA MATCH ON OUR SIDE

01:28:26.134 --> 01:28:27.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

MEDICAL DATA BASE THAT WE CAN DO

ALREADY BEEN ADDRESSED ONE OF

01:34:09.143 --> 01:34:11.379 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEM WAS I THINK PROBABLY MOST

01:34:11.445 --> 01:34:12.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IMPORTANT QUESTION THAT I CAN.

01:34:12.813 --> 01:34:14.682 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SPEAK TO IS IS WHY THESE TESTS

01:34:14.749 --> 01:34:17.051 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AREN'T HAPPENING AND HEARING THE

01:34:17.118 --> 01:34:17.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
PRIOR.

01:34:18.019 --> 01:34:20.087 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TESTIMONY OR IN THE CAR THE

01:34:20.154 --> 01:34:21.055 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PRIOR STATEMENTS AND THEN ALSO

01:34:21.122 --> 01:34:23.124 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COMPANY TOGETHER MY KNOWLEDGE.

01:34:23.190 --> 01:34:24.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF WHAT HAPPENS I THINK ONE OF

01:34:24.191 --> 01:34:26.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE. THINGS I SEE ON THE GROUND

01:34:26.660 --> 01:34:26.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
A LOT IS.

01:34:26.927 --> 01:34:28.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:29.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PHONE CALL NOT COMPLEXITY NOT

01:34:29.096 --> 01:34:30.297 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ADHERENCE TO A PARTICULAR

01:34:30.364 --> 01:34:32.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
TREATMENT PLANTS.

01:34:32.166 --> 01:34:34.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SO ONE EXAMPLE MIGHT BE THE

01:34:34.802 --> 01:34:35.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FAMILY MISSES THE TWELVE MONTH

01:34:35.569 --> 01:34:36.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
POINT BECOMING A FIFTEEN OR

FOURTEEN MONTHS AND YOU'RE

01:34:37.938 --> 01:34:38.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THINKING ABOUT THE FIFTEEN MONTH

WHERE IT'S.

01:34:40.107 --> 01:34:41.442 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU KNOW WHAT THE TWELVE MONTH

01:34:41.509 --> 01:34:43.177 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IS THAT NO STANDARD BREAD AND

01:34:43.244 --> 01:34:44.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUTTER TEACHING TO. TO DO THAT

01:34:44.678 --> 01:34:46.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE LEAD SCREENING AND THEN SAME

01:34:46.647 --> 01:34:47.248 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THING AGAIN AT HOW TWENTY FOUR

01:34:47.314 --> 01:34:48.516 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MONTHS THEY MISSED TWENTY FOUR

01:34:51.452 --> 01:34:53.320 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CRAZY AND SO THEY THEY MISS THAT

01:34:53.387 --> 01:34:54.655 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND YOU DON'T THINK BACK TO YOU

01:34:54.722 --> 01:34:56.457 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
KNOW THE THE LEAD TESTING.

01:34:56.524 --> 01:34:58.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AT THE TWENTY FOUR MONTH KIND

01:34:58.492 --> 01:34:58.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
OF APPOINTMENT.

01:34:58.859 --> 01:35:00.361 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:35:00.428 --> 01:35:01.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I SETS SO THAT'S ONE PART OF IT

01:35:01.929 --> 01:35:03.130 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
I'M NOT SURE IF MEDI CAL

01:35:03.197 --> 01:35:04.298 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ACTUALLY CAPTURES LIKE WHEN

01:35:04.365 --> 01:35:05.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PEOPLE ACTUALLY MISS THOSE

01:35:05.599 --> 01:35:07.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
APPOINTMENTS YOU KNOW AT THE AT

01:35:07.334 --> 01:35:09.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE SETS PERCENT TIMES. I'M AND

01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:11.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEN OF COURSE NOT GETTING THE

01:35:11.539 --> 01:35:13.474 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TESTS THEMSELVES RIGHT SO I

01:35:13.541 --> 01:35:15.042 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES I.

01:35:15.109 --> 01:35:16.210 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GO BACK MY YOU KNOW ELECTRONIC

01:35:16.277 --> 01:35:17.278 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HEALTH RECORD BOX EXPECTING TO

01:35:17.344 --> 01:35:18.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SEE SOME LAB RESULTS AND THERE'S

01:35:18.546 --> 01:35:20.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NOTHING THERE NOTHING CONTINUES

01:35:20.648 --> 01:35:21.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO COME BACK BECAUSE THE FAMILY

01:35:21.282 --> 01:35:22.149 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
JUST.

01:35:22.216 --> 01:35:24.218 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MISUNDERSTOOD WHAT I WENT HOME

01:35:24.285 --> 01:35:25.152 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OR THE GYM WAS REALLY UPSETS OR

01:35:25.219 --> 01:35:26.087 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IN A ONE OF A MILLION THINGS

01:35:26.153 --> 01:35:27.588 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COULD HAVE HAPPENED AND AND THE

01:35:27.655 --> 01:35:29.990 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TEST OF SIMPLY. DIDN'T HAPPEN.

01:35:30.057 --> 01:35:31.525 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND SO YOU KNOW IT'S KINDA

01:35:31.592 --> 01:35:32.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NATURE THE LIFE WE HAVE A SMALL

01:35:32.693 --> 01:35:35.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
KID AND THAT THINGS LIKE THAT TO

01:35:35.229 --> 01:35:35.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
COME UP.

01:35:35.463 --> 01:35:36.597 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:35:36.664 --> 01:35:37.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AND SO I THINK THAT THAT

01:35:37.898 --> 01:35:38.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ACTUALLY MIGHT PLAY A LITTLE BIT

01:35:38.566 --> 01:35:40.434 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF A ROLE AS WELL AS IT IS TOUGH

01:35:40.501 --> 01:35:41.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO CAPTURE THAT RIGHT AT THE

01:35:41.869 --> 01:35:43.537 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LEVEL OF AGAINST ON THE FOLKS

01:35:43.604 --> 01:35:44.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
WHO'VE BEEN SPEAKING.

01:35:44.071 --> 01:35:45.272 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
BEFORE ME.

01:35:45.339 --> 01:35:47.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BUT THAT COULD BE SOMETHING

01:35:47.441 --> 01:35:48.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING UPS I'VE

01:35:48.309 --> 01:35:48.843 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SEEN IT HAPPEN ON A HOW MANY

01:35:48.909 --> 01:35:50.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TIMES EVEN IN THE LAST WEEK WITH

01:35:50.711 --> 01:35:52.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
DIFFERENT TESTS FOR ALL

01:35:52.113 --> 01:35:53.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DIFFERENT AGES ACROSS THE THE

01:35:53.681 --> 01:35:55.382 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
SPECTRUM THAT I SEE.

01:35:55.449 --> 01:35:57.318 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:35:57.384 --> 01:35:58.052 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SO I THINK THOSE ARE KIND OF

01:35:58.119 --> 01:35:59.487 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SOME OF THE MAIN THINGS.

01:35:59.553 --> 01:36:01.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
JUSTICE SPEAK REALLY QUICKLY TO

01:36:01.322 --> 01:36:02.823 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE POINT OF CARE TESTING WHICH

01:36:02.890 --> 01:36:04.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HAVE COME UP UP AS WELL AS WAS

01:36:04.191 --> 01:36:05.192 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
LOOKING THROUGH SOME OF THE

01:36:05.259 --> 01:36:06.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT PUBLIC

01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:06.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
HEALTH.

01:36:06.794 --> 01:36:09.330 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
HIM BROCHURES THAT'S NEVER

01:36:09.396 --> 01:36:10.331 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
REALLY GREAT SET OF OF.

01:36:10.397 --> 01:36:12.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INFORMATION PACKETS ONLINE AND

01:36:12.533 --> 01:36:13.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THERE IS YOU KNOW A AN

01:36:13.534 --> 01:36:15.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EXHORTATION TO REPORT THE POINT

01:36:15.136 --> 01:36:16.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF CARE TESTING BUT AGAIN THOSE

01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:18.105 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ARE. NOT AS EASY TO GET IN THE

01:36:18.172 --> 01:36:19.607 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CLINIC SO IF YOU TO TRY TO

01:36:19.673 --> 01:36:21.075 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
MITIGATE THAT'S KIND OF

01:36:21.142 --> 01:36:23.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NONCOMPLIANCE FROM THE THE BLOOD

01:36:23.310 --> 01:36:24.145 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DROP IN THE ARE WHICH CAN BE

01:36:24.211 --> 01:36:25.379 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LIVE THE MORE PAINFUL ARE MORE

01:36:25.446 --> 01:36:26.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DIFFICULT TO GET. BY GETTING THE

01:36:26.914 --> 01:36:28.382 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
POINT OF CARE TESTING.

01:36:28.449 --> 01:36:29.850 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NEARLY AS THEY SOUGHT TO REPORT

01:36:29.917 --> 01:36:32.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUT IT'S IT SOMETIMES IT'S A

01:36:32.353 --> 01:36:32.653 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
LITTLE BIT MORE.

01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:33.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:36:34.054 --> 01:36:35.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAD DIFFICULTY MAINTAINER TO GET

01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:36.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT POINT AFTER TESTING IS NOT

01:36:36.924 --> 01:36:38.759 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ALWAYS NO CHEAP POOR ARE WORTH.

01:36:38.826 --> 01:36:40.427 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FINANCIALLY WORTH YOU KNOW

01:36:40.494 --> 01:36:41.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
KEEPING IN THE CLINIC AS OPPOSED

01:36:41.729 --> 01:36:43.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO JUST HAVING THE PERSON GO

01:36:43.097 --> 01:36:44.098 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
OVER TO THE LABORATORY

01:36:44.165 --> 01:36:45.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LABORATORY DOES AS WE MENTIONED

01:36:45.699 --> 01:36:47.668 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BEFORE. NO REPORT OVER TO.

01:36:47.735 --> 01:36:49.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH

01:36:49.770 --> 01:36:50.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
BUT.

01:36:50.204 --> 01:36:52.506 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DUBBED THE POINT OF TESTING YOU

01:36:52.573 --> 01:36:53.440 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
KNOW THAT THAT GOES TO A

01:36:53.507 --> 01:36:55.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DIFFERENT SORT OF REPORTING FORM

01:36:55.309 --> 01:36:56.210 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RIGHT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T COME

01:36:56.277 --> 01:36:57.478 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FROM A LAB COMMISSION THE CLINIC

01:36:57.545 --> 01:36:58.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
ITSELF.

01:36:58.345 --> 01:37:00.147 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SO THAT'S ONE ONE AREA THAT

01:37:00.214 --> 01:37:02.516 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MIGHT BE KIND OF A CAP IN THEIR

01:37:02.583 --> 01:37:03.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN THAT WEEK BMB LACKEY MISSING

01:37:04.051 --> 01:37:05.419 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SOME PEOPLE WHO. COULD GET

01:37:05.486 --> 01:37:06.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CLINICAL TESTING BUT THE ICONS

01:37:07.054 --> 01:37:08.522 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

BOB YOU WERE DISCUSSING THAT

01:38:03.844 --> 01:38:05.246 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SOMEONE WHO WAS SUPPOSED

COMMENDED TWELVE MONTHS COMES IN

01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:08.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AT FIFTEEN THIS MAY CREATE SOME

01:38:08.782 --> 01:38:11.252 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CONFUSION IN THE DOCTOR'S MIND.

01:38:11.318 --> 01:38:12.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AS TO WHETHER OR NOT I SHOULD BE

DATA YES.

01:38:23.497 --> 01:38:24.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
LIFE CAN BE VERY HECTIC FOR

01:38:24.698 --> 01:38:26.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
PEDIATRICIANS.

01:38:26.734 --> 01:38:27.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THEY DON'T GET PAID ENOUGH

01:38:28.002 --> 01:38:29.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND. THEY END UP HAVING MORE

01:38:29.937 --> 01:38:33.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
PATIENCE THAN THAN NAM.

01:38:33.807 --> 01:38:36.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THEN PERHAPS IS OPTIMAL AND.

01:38:36.176 --> 01:38:38.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO IT'S IT IS A DIFFICULT LIFE.

OUR DAD TO.

01:38:47.288 --> 01:38:50.124 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

01:38:50.190 --> 01:38:51.925 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TESTIS THERE SOME. SOMETHING

01:38:51.992 --> 01:38:54.128 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ANY OF THEIR MEDICAL RECORDS

01:38:54.194 --> 01:38:56.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT COULD BE ADDED THAT WOULD

01:38:56.297 --> 01:38:56.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
TURN ON.

01:38:56.530 --> 01:38:58.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
YOU NOW.

01:38:58.132 --> 01:38:59.867 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NEXT ALLEY LOOKS AT THAT MEDICAL

01:38:59.933 --> 01:39:02.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RECORD IT SHOWS UP BRIGHT RED

01:39:02.202 --> 01:39:04.171 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GET IT WOULD GET LEAD TEST WE

01:39:04.238 --> 01:39:05.339 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
HAVE BEEN DONE IT YET.

01:39:05.406 --> 01:39:08.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
ARM.

01:39:08.208 --> 01:39:09.777 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
JUST ANY SUGGESTIONS YOU COULD

01:39:09.843 --> 01:39:10.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
MAKE WOULD BE HELPFUL YEAH

01:39:10.778 --> 01:39:12.880 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD POINT SO.

01:39:12.946 --> 01:39:14.214 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
ACTUALLY.

01:39:14.281 --> 01:39:16.317 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SEE BOTH ADULTS AND KIDS ACTION

01:39:16.383 --> 01:39:18.485 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
OF TO BOARD CERTIFICATION

01:39:18.552 --> 01:39:19.320 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SERGEANTS IN WHAT'S FROM THE

01:39:19.386 --> 01:39:21.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ADULTS I BECAUSE I'M WHERE I

01:39:21.188 --> 01:39:22.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WORK WE ACTUALLY DO HAVE KINDA.

01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:24.425 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SCOTT HEALTH MAINTENANCE TAB.

01:39:24.491 --> 01:39:25.759 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND I WOULD IMAGINE A LOT OF

01:39:25.826 --> 01:39:26.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PLACES DO THAT FOR KIDS WHO JUST

01:39:26.994 --> 01:39:28.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STARTED DEVELOPING AT FOR ADULTS

01:39:28.329 --> 01:39:30.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OF FOR EXAMPLE FIFTY TWO YEAR

01:39:30.097 --> 01:39:31.865 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OLD MALE COMES AND. SHOULD HAVE

01:39:31.932 --> 01:39:32.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
A COLONOSCOPY BY THAT POINT

01:39:32.933 --> 01:39:35.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THERE'S A BIG RED DOT BY KIND OF

01:39:35.436 --> 01:39:36.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN THAT PORTION OF THE TAB THAT

01:39:36.070 --> 01:39:36.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
SAYS HEY.

01:39:36.770 --> 01:39:37.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
S. PERSON ACTUALLY NEEDS A

01:39:37.338 --> 01:39:38.372 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
COLONOSCOPY BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:39:38.439 --> 01:39:39.873 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PASSED THE POINT OF GETTING A

01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:41.408 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TEST. YOU CAN IMAGINE THE SAME

01:39:41.475 --> 01:39:42.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THING YOU KNOW GOES FOR SO

01:39:43.010 --> 01:39:44.912 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ACTUALLY DO HAVE A FOR VACCINES

01:39:44.978 --> 01:39:46.480 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOR OUR CHILDREN AND SO ALSO YOU

01:39:46.547 --> 01:39:47.147 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
KNOW THEY NEED TO.

01:39:47.214 --> 01:39:49.483 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE NEXT IN AMMONIA VACCINE

01:39:49.550 --> 01:39:50.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT'S IN READ WITH A DATE THAT IT

01:39:51.018 --> 01:39:51.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE.

01:39:51.685 --> 01:39:52.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SO THAT ACTUALLY A GREAT

01:39:52.653 --> 01:39:53.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MECHANISM TO TO JUST REMIND

01:39:53.921 --> 01:39:55.389 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
DOCTORS THAT THAT'S

01:39:55.456 --> 01:39:56.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
BUT THAT'S THEIR.

01:39:56.590 --> 01:39:58.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ENDS NOT ALL OF THE DIFFERENT

01:39:58.759 --> 01:40:00.227 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HEALTH PLANS ARE ALL DIFFERENT

01:40:00.294 --> 01:40:01.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CLINICS ARE SINCE THEN THE HR

01:40:01.729 --> 01:40:02.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOR THE MOST PART SOME OF THEM

01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:04.531 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEM VERY DIFFERENT THAN OTHERS

01:40:04.598 --> 01:40:06.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUT. YOU COULD HAVE YOU KNOW

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THOSE KINDS REMINDERS PAPA. NAM.

01:40:10.504 --> 01:40:12.139 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DOES THAT MAKE YOU WOULD HAVE TO

HIGH SATISFY THAT TOOK ARE.

01:40:13.107 --> 01:40:13.240 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
CLEAR.

01:40:13.307 --> 01:40:15.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:40:15.175 --> 01:40:16.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NOT HAVE A A COMPLIANCE BAR OKAY

01:40:16.810 --> 01:40:17.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WELL PERHAPS WE COULD HAVE.

01:40:17.378 --> 01:40:19.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:40:19.813 --> 01:40:22.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OUR DISCUSSIONS LATER RON.

WITH APPROPRIATE FOLKS TO SEE.

01:40:25.419 --> 01:40:26.587 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
HOW WHETHER OR NOT?

01:40:26.653 --> 01:40:29.456 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THIS EXISTS PARTICULARLY IN THE

01:40:29.523 --> 01:40:31.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
ONLINE MEDICAL RECORDS.

01:40:31.725 --> 01:40:33.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

01:41:18.138 --> 01:41:20.140 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AGAIN I REALLY THINK AND WE'LL

01:41:20.207 --> 01:41:22.376 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FIND OUT FROM THE MEMBERS OF THE

01:41:22.443 --> 01:41:23.410 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FIRST PANEL WHETHER OR NOT

01:41:23.477 --> 01:41:25.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
THERE'S AN ACCURATE.

01:41:25.345 --> 01:41:27.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
IN OFFICE TEST.

01:41:28.048 --> 01:41:29.249 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT MIGHT BE USED FOR THAT AND

01:41:29.316 --> 01:41:30.551 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
OTHERS.

01:41:30.617 --> 01:41:32.419 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
ARM.

01:41:32.486 --> 01:41:33.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE DON'T YET KNOW WHETHER OR NOT

01:41:33.954 --> 01:41:36.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THERE ARE ADEQUATE TESTS AND

01:41:36.223 --> 01:41:37.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THEY'VE EVEN SAID THAT.

01:41:38.025 --> 01:41:39.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THE BLOOD DRAW HAS TO BE.

01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:41.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
FROM MA.

01:41:42.029 --> 01:41:43.697 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OWNER SHOULD NOT BE VENOUS BLOOD

01:41:43.764 --> 01:41:45.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DROP THAT HAS TO BE FROM THE.

01:41:45.566 --> 01:41:47.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
HI.

01:41:47.334 --> 01:41:49.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
TARTARY.

01:41:49.336 --> 01:41:51.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO THAT JUST TO GET THE ACCURACY

01:41:52.005 --> 01:41:55.776 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT THEY NEEDS OF THAT TIME.

01:41:55.843 --> 01:41:57.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WELL WE'LL SEE IF THAT'S CLOSELY

01:41:57.778 --> 01:41:59.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHICH REALLY NECESSARY IN TRYING

01:41:59.112 --> 01:42:01.048 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO GET A BETTER IDEA THAT DO YOU

01:42:01.114 --> 01:42:02.850 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON.

01:42:02.916 --> 01:42:04.785 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ACCURACY OF IN OFFICE TASKS

01:42:04.852 --> 01:42:06.753 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
VERSUS VENUS TASK VERSUS ARTERY

01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:08.489 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
TEST

01:42:08.555 --> 01:42:10.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THERE ARE ALSO SMART TO MY

01:42:10.591 --> 01:42:11.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
KNOWLEDGE THINK VENUS TESTING

01:42:11.725 --> 01:42:13.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STILL BAND CONCERTS. ADEQUATE

01:42:13.794 --> 01:42:15.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
FOR FOR.

01:42:15.128 --> 01:42:16.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FOR BLOOD DRAWS I THINK THAT

01:42:16.797 --> 01:42:18.031 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN IN THE

01:42:18.098 --> 01:42:19.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
LIMITS OF DETECTION IN THE

01:42:19.433 --> 01:42:20.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ACCURACY FOR THE POINT OF CARE

01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:22.569 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ONCE OR EVEN IN BUSY OFFICES

01:42:22.636 --> 01:42:24.471 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
THAT ARE.

01:42:24.538 --> 01:42:25.205 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
BIKE UP I TALKED ABOUT TO

01:42:25.272 --> 01:42:26.473 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PEDIATRICIANS KIND OF BEEN IN MY

01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:27.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
AREA IN.

01:42:27.808 --> 01:42:28.575 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
KIND OF IN PREPARATION FOR THIS

01:42:28.642 --> 01:42:29.643 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IS WHILE THEY'RE ALL PRETTY

01:42:29.710 --> 01:42:32.212 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RIGID ABOUT GETTING THE TESTING.

01:42:32.279 --> 01:42:33.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BUT A LOT OF ACTION BUT NOT

01:42:34.047 --> 01:42:35.048 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MADE THE POINT TO GET THAT THE

01:42:35.115 --> 01:42:36.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
POINT COURTESY AGAIN BECAUSE OF

01:42:36.750 --> 01:42:37.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE ACCURACY SO I THINK AS WE

01:42:37.718 --> 01:42:38.986 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SEE A LITTLE MORE DEVELOPMENT

01:42:39.052 --> 01:42:41.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND THOSE TESTS. AND WE MIGHT

01:42:41.221 --> 01:42:42.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SEE MORE ADOPTION OF UP AND DOWN

01:42:42.990 --> 01:42:44.825 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AGAIN THROUGH YOU KNOW THAT THE

01:42:44.892 --> 01:42:45.259 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
ADEQUATE REPORTING.

01:42:45.325 --> 01:42:45.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:42:46.059 --> 01:42:47.828 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT WOULD PROBABLY BRING UP THE

01:42:47.895 --> 01:42:49.897 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LEVELS LITTLE BIT. IN TERMS OF

01:42:49.963 --> 01:42:50.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU KNOW HOW MANY KIDS ARE BOTH

01:42:51.064 --> 01:42:52.232 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TESTED AND REPORTED RIGHT TO

01:42:52.299 --> 01:42:53.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COME CLOSE THAT KIND OF GAP OF

01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:55.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHO'S NOT WHO MIGHT BE TESTED

01:42:55.269 --> 01:42:56.537 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUT NOT REPORTED IN THE FIRST

01:42:56.603 --> 01:42:56.737 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
PLACE.

01:42:56.803 --> 01:42:58.372 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:42:58.438 --> 01:42:59.139 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
AND THEN.

01:42:59.206 --> 01:43:00.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
AND I RECEIVED A COSTS

01:43:01.041 --> 01:43:02.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
A FACTOR FOR SOME CLINICS IS IS

01:43:02.409 --> 01:43:03.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
A BIG DEAL WITH THESE TESTS

01:43:03.243 --> 01:43:04.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
POINT ACCORDIONS ARE. CHEAPER

01:43:04.311 --> 01:43:05.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
JUST GOING THROUGH A FOR A BUNCH

01:43:05.546 --> 01:43:07.080 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
OF OTHER DIFFERENT TESTS.

01:43:07.147 --> 01:43:08.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NOT ONLY LEAD BUT FOR YOU KNOW

01:43:09.049 --> 01:43:09.750 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
KINDA LIVER TESTS AND THINGS

01:43:09.816 --> 01:43:10.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
LIKE THAT IN A CLINIC AND

01:43:10.851 --> 01:43:12.452 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT CHEAP

01:43:12.519 --> 01:43:12.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
UNFORTUNATE FOR NOW AND

01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:14.288 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
HOPEFULLY AS.

01:43:14.354 --> 01:43:15.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
YOU KNOW.

01:43:15.222 --> 01:43:17.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
EWING THINGS GO OF IT LESS

01:43:17.124 --> 01:43:18.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EXPENSIVE TECHNOLOGIES BASS IS A

01:43:18.358 --> 01:43:19.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
LITTLE BIT THEN WE CAN MORE

01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:21.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RELIABLY USE THOSE ARE EXPECTED

01:43:21.662 --> 01:43:23.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO BE A LITTLE BIT LESS MORE

01:43:23.897 --> 01:43:25.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COST EFFECTIVE LESS EXPENSIVE.

01:43:25.232 --> 01:43:25.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
LEARN.

01:43:25.999 --> 01:43:27.401 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
ARM.

01:43:27.467 --> 01:43:29.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT MEANS TAKE A LOOK AT TO SEE

01:43:29.202 --> 01:43:30.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER

01:43:30.270 --> 01:43:31.438 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
QUESTIONS I HAVE IN MY NOTES

01:43:31.505 --> 01:43:34.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
HERE.

01:43:34.141 --> 01:43:36.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
HOME.

01:43:36.243 --> 01:43:38.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DO YOU SEE HERE A DIFFERENCE IN

01:43:38.612 --> 01:43:40.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT TYPE OF PRACTICE PEOPLE

01:43:40.647 --> 01:43:40.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
HAVE.

01:43:40.847 --> 01:43:43.150 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DEPENDING ON. WHERE THEY ARE

01:43:43.216 --> 01:43:45.519 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FOR EXAMPLE PEROT PRACTICES

01:43:45.586 --> 01:43:47.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
VERSUS PRACTICES IN THE CITY'S

01:43:47.220 --> 01:43:49.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
VERSUS PRACTICES AND CLINICS

01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:50.691 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
PURSES?

01:43:50.757 --> 01:43:52.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OUR POSITIONS AND ARE AT AT TAKE

01:43:52.926 --> 01:43:54.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
KAISER WHICH IS HALF THE STATE

01:43:54.928 --> 01:43:56.496 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THIS POINT BUT IT'S DIFFERENT

01:43:56.563 --> 01:43:58.498 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
FROM PRIVATE PRACTICE.

01:43:58.565 --> 01:43:59.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
I UNIVERSITIES.

01:43:59.399 --> 01:44:00.867 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:44:00.934 --> 01:44:02.336 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DO YOU SEE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES

01:44:02.402 --> 01:44:04.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
IN DIFFERENT AREAS.

01:44:04.338 --> 01:44:05.272 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YEAH I MEAN I THINK THERE ARE

01:44:05.339 --> 01:44:05.906 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
DIFFERENT.

01:44:05.973 --> 01:44:07.407 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE COULD EVER PRACTICES IN

01:44:07.474 --> 01:44:09.009 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
DIFFERENT AREAS SO.

01:44:09.076 --> 01:44:10.277 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
FOR EXAMPLE I SPOKE WITH

01:44:10.344 --> 01:44:11.178 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SOMEONE WHO IS IN PRIVATE

01:44:11.244 --> 01:44:12.846 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PRACTICE WHO WAS VERY VERY

01:44:12.913 --> 01:44:14.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
DILIGENT AND CONSCIENTIOUS

01:44:14.414 --> 01:44:15.682 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
PEDIATRICIAN.

01:44:15.749 --> 01:44:17.317 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
SHE.

01:44:17.384 --> 01:44:19.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DOES THAT BASIN THAT RISK

01:44:19.853 --> 01:44:21.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ASSESSMENT RYAN WAS NEW RISK

01:44:21.154 --> 01:44:23.090 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ASSESSMENT. THEY'LL SAY OKAY IS

01:44:23.156 --> 01:44:24.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE DOES THE CHILD MEETS COMIC.

01:44:24.591 --> 01:44:27.094 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CRITERIA TO GET TESTED AND ON

01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:27.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE GO AHEAD AND TOSS THEM AND

01:44:27.961 --> 01:44:29.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ACTUALLY SHE'S ALL HAD ONE CHILD

01:44:29.129 --> 01:44:30.464 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TURNED POSITIVE BECAUSE. RISK

01:44:30.530 --> 01:44:32.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ASSESSMENT IS PRETTY GOOD ENOUGH

01:44:32.232 --> 01:44:34.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IF YOU ASK THEM REPORT AND HOUSE

01:44:34.801 --> 01:44:36.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THOSE MADE BEFORE YOU KNOW

01:44:36.203 --> 01:44:36.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT OR

01:44:37.037 --> 01:44:38.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
WHATEVER.

01:44:38.138 --> 01:44:41.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND SO YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S

01:44:41.808 --> 01:44:44.211 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
THAT PRACTICE THEIR.

01:44:44.277 --> 01:44:48.315 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IN ME I LIKE A COUNTY CLINIC OR.

01:44:48.382 --> 01:44:51.318 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FQHC FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH

01:44:51.385 --> 01:44:54.488 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
CENTER THEY TEND TO BE MUCH
MORE.

01:44:54.554 --> 01:44:56.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ARE ON TOP OF THE INCOME OF

01:44:56.790 --> 01:44:57.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THAT'S JUST WHAT THEY DO

01:44:58.058 --> 01:44:59.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
UNIVERSALLY RIGHT BECAUSE THEY

01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:02.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HAVE THE MEDI CAL. UP PATIENTS

01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:05.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ARE HEROES BECAUSE MOST OF THE

01:45:05.966 --> 01:45:07.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RURAL ENVIRONMENT HAS ALLIES.

01:45:07.834 --> 01:45:09.803 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
QUITE THE OPPOSITE THAT BUT.

01:45:09.870 --> 01:45:14.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUT IT DEPENDS YOU KNOW THAT.

01:45:14.341 --> 01:45:15.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:45:15.375 --> 01:45:16.443 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT DOES DEPEND EVEN WITHIN THE

01:45:16.510 --> 01:45:17.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CITY OF ALACHUA COUNTY OF LA

01:45:17.110 --> 01:45:17.944 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHERE IT WHERE YOU'RE PRACTICING

01:45:18.011 --> 01:45:18.211 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
WHAT THAT.

01:45:18.278 --> 01:45:19.212 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:45:19.279 --> 01:45:20.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EXPECTATIONS ARE THAT YOU HAVE
