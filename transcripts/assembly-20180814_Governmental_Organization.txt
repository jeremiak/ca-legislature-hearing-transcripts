I'D JUST LIKE TO REMIND ALL INTERESTED PARTIES THAT NO FORMAL VOTE WILL BE TAKEN TODAY. TODAY'S HEARING IS FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO BE BRIEFED ON THE CONTENTS OF THE CONTACT AS IT CANNOT BE AMENDED BY THE LEGISLATURE. AS PETE ONE ZERO FIVE ONE BY CENTER DODD WHICH IS PENDING ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR IS THE RATIFICATION BILL FOR THIS CONTACT. AND AT SOME POINT WILL BE TAKEN UP FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE ENTIRE BODY ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR. I WOULD LIKE UP PERSONALLY AND AS A COMMITTEE THANK OUR WITNESSES IN ADVANCE FOR TAKING TIME OUT OF THEIR BUSY SCHEDULES TO BE WITH US TODAY. WITHOUT FURTHER ADO LET'S BEGIN THE HEARING. WHO WOULD LIKE BUT I'D LIKE TO INVITE THE? THE UP MEMBERS OF THE TRIBAL COUNCIL TO COME UP IN PRESENT. MR DOING WHICH YOU PROBABLY LIKE TO SET THE STAGE FOR THIS ACTUALLY. THANK YOU AND I WILL -- GO LET YOU KIND OF HANDLE THE INTRODUCTION OF OF THE DIFFERENT PARTIES AND HAVE THEM READ -- ABSOLUTE CHAIRMAN MY OF MY HONOR TO DO SO -- I THINK IS ALWAYS YOU PROVIDED OUTSTANDING SUMMARY OF THE COMPACT -- THAT THE BAND HAS THE NINETEEN NINETY NINE TRAVEL STATE GAMING COMPACT BUT CURRENTLY DOESN'T HAVE ANY CLASS THREE GAMING -- THEY'RE LOCATED IN A BEAUTIFUL SECTION OF NORTH SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUT CLEARLY THAT PROVIDES CHALLENGES WITH A GUIDE TO DEVELOPING -- COMMERCIAL GAMING OPERATIONS I THINK THEY THEY BEEN A DOING A VARIETY OF THINGS INCLUDING I THINK ZIP LINE TO TO TRY -- TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE BEAUTIFUL LOCATION THAT THEY HAVE BUT WITH THAT WITH THIS COMPACT -- IT'S SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THE OTHER COMPACTS THAT WE'VE NEGOTIATED YOU'VE RATIFIED I THINK THERE A COUPLE THINGS THAT'LL TOUCH UPON THAT ARE UNIQUE TO TO LOW HIGH IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE [inaudible] ONE WITH REGARD -- TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION PROVISIONS WE'VE BEEN NEGOTIATING WITH THE HIGHEST PART OF A LARGER GROUP FOR THREE AND A HALF TO FOUR YEARS AS WE GOT CLOSE TO THE END OF THE SESSION -- WE FOCUSED ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE TRIBE BEEN AND WERE ABLE TO TO COME TO A FINAL AGREEMENT. BUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROVISIONS THERE ARE NEW AND THEY REFLECT THAT -- THE RECOGNITION THAT THAT -- THAT THE CHALLENGES FACING SMALLER TRIBES OR A DIFFERENT SO. WE BUILT IN TO THAT COMPAQ. THE SAME BASIC -- STEPS THEY'RE INVOLVED IN IN ALL COMPACT AT THE GARDEN FOR A MIDDLE MITIGATION THE TRIBE WILL IF THERE'S A PROJECT WILL IDENTIFIED THAT -- OFF RESERVATION IMPACTS COME UP WITH A PLAN TO ADDRESS THOSE IMPACTS TO MITIGATION -- WHICH ULTIMATELY RESULTED IN MITIGATION AGREEMENT IN THIS CASE BETWEEN THE STATE THERE ARE SOME -- STEPS IN THE PROCESS THAT INCLUDE NOTICE TO OF ALL INCHES PARTIES INCLUDING THE LOCAL AFFECTED JURISDICTION. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS SOME DISAGREEMENT AS TO WHETHER THAT MEDICATION AGREEMENT EFFECTIVELY MITIGATES THERE'S A PROCESS FOR ARBITRATION -- IN ADDITION ONE OTHER UNIQUE ASPECT ABOUT THE COMPACT REFLECTS SOMETHING UNIQUE ABOUT THAT THE TRIBE IN THAT IS THE FACT THAT. THEIR RESERVATION AND THE VERY MIDDLE OF THE RESERVATION IS IS A SPANISH LAND GRANT WHICH IS -- REFLECTED I GUESS ON THE MAP THAT'S ADDED APPENDIX A OF THE COMPACT AS AS A PORTION OF OF OF LAND THAT -- IS POTENTIALLY ELIGIBLE FOR GAMING UNDER FEDERAL LAW -- BUT IF IT BECOMES -- ENTRUSTS HELD IN TRUST BY UNITED STATES FOR THE TRIBE THAT WITHOUT AN AMENDMENT TO THE CONTACT THE TRIBE COULD GAME ON THAT LAND -- SO THOSE ARE THE TWO THINGS I THINK BETTER. OF DIFFERENT ABOUT THE COMPACT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OTHERWISE ALTERNATE OVER TO THE CHAIRMAN OF RODRIGUEZ AND FROM THE LIVE BAND. WHEN WE GO AHEAD OF CHAIRMAN RODRIGUEZ AND AND?

AND WE PUT A CASINO OR EVEN BUSINESS SO -- WHERE LITTLE UP FAR OUT -- WE WERE ABOUT THREE THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL UPON A MOUNTAIN SO. WE HAVE TO GO UPGRADE. AND BY BELOW US IS RINCON GA HAS A BIG HARRIS CASINO DOWN BELOW WHICH IS MAYBE ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES FROM US. BUT BECAUSE WERE UP THE HILL AND BACK EAST A LITTLE EAST FOR THEM -- IT'S A CHALLENGE. TO INVITE PEOPLE UP AND AND YOU KNOW BECAUSE WHEN I GO UP THERE. WHEN THEY HAVE A CASINO DOWN BELOW RIGHT SO WE HAVE?

I WOULD BE WE WOULD LIKE IT. YOUR SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MISTER GRIFFIN I SEE THAT YOU'RE HERE -- MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS -- MY NAME'S JACK RIBBON. I WORK WITH UNITE HERE THE HOTEL AND CASINO WORKERS UNION IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LETTING ME TESTIFY WE ARE. REALLY HAPPY WITH HOW THIS -- SECRETARY OF OR OR LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE -- FOR THE GOVERNOR AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE TRIBES HAVE WORKED TOGETHER OVER THE PAST NUMBER OF YEARS. AND CREATING A SITUATION WHERE. TRIBES HAVE AN ABILITY TO CREATE -- AND AN OPPORTUNITY -- TO TO EDUCATE THEIR KIDS AND MOM AND CREATES AN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WHILE KEEPING IN MIND THE OTHER AREAS THAT NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT WORKERS LOCAL COMMUNITIES ETCETERA. AND WE JUST. SUPPORT THIS COMPACT. IN EVERY WAY WE POSSIBLY CAN. AND WE WHICH THE LAW HIGH UP BAND OF LIVE SANYO INDIANS ARE THE BEST OF LUCK -- AND HOPEFULLY YOU'RE UP AND RUNNING SOON. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THOSE COMMENTS. HOW ABOUT OF -- WE OPENED UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT DOES ANYONEWISH TO STEP UP AND AND GIVE. COMMENTS OF SUPPORT. IS THERE ANYONE HERE WITH COMMENTS OF OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE BRING IT BACK. TO THE DIGEST ANYONE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. SEEING THAT I MIGHT HAVE A COUPLE MISTER DOLAN IF YOU COULD YOU KNOW THIS THIS COMPACT -- IT'S PRETTY MUCH A STRAIGHTFORWARD MERE OF MANY OF THE CONTACTS IT THAT EXISTS BUT THIS ONE DOES HAVE A LITTLE TWIST TO IT DOES ALLOW FOR THREE FACILITIES. COULD YOU EXPLAIN TO US HOW WE WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ON ON THAT ACTION AND HELP EXPLAIN IT BETTER TELL YOU SIR I I THINK THAT. THE NINETY NINE COMPACT ALLOWED -- FOR TO YEAH ANY NEGOTIATIONS INVOLVES -- TRYING TO FIND -- TERMS THAT WORK FOR FOR BOTH PARTIES AND AND I THINK FROM THAT THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE AS LONG AS WE HAVE EFFECTIVE. REGULATORY OVERSIGHT DO WE HAVE THE PROVISIONS FOR THE GUARDIAN VIABLE MITIGATION -- DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF OF IT TRIES RESERVATIONS SOME TRIBES MAY -- SEEK TO A GAME AND TO FACILITIES SAM THREE SOME HAVE AGREED TO ONE JUST BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THAT THE RESERVATION SO WE WE WORKED HARD TO TRY TO GET. AND WE'RE PLEASED THAT THAT -- I THINK IT WORKS FOR THE TRIBE BUT IT ALSO WORKS FOR THE STATE WITH REGARD TO THE PROVISIONS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO US WHETHER IT'S LABOR. ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION THE CREDITS THAT PROVIDE SUPPORT TO KNOW IF THE TRIBE GROWS TO THAT LEVEL OF SUPPORT NOT JUST FOR THE MEMBERSHIP BUT ALSO FOR THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. WELL I I CERTAINLY AGREE I THINK THE COMMENTS THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN MADE -- KINDA REFLECTED WHAT THEIR GOALS AND ASPIRATIONS ARE AND THEY RECOGNIZE -- THE FACT THAT. THEY'RE A SMALLER COMMUNITY AND AND AND THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THEY COMPETE IN THE BIGGER WORLD -- SO I WAS JUST CAN RAISE IN THE QUESTION AND I WAS RAISING A A CONCERN WITH WITH ANY STUDIES DONE IN MARKET SHARE. IF THAT'S SUSTAINABLE ON HOW THAT COULD WORK AT JUST BECAUSE OF THE CLOSE PROXIMITY OF COMPETITION. AND HAVING THREE WOULD THAT BE SUSTAINABLE YEAH THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION -- VICE CHAIR I WOULD SAY THAT THAT THE COMPACT ALLOWS THE TRIBE THE FLEXIBILITY TO GROW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THREE OR THAT THEY'RE GOING. TO GO TO TWO THOUSAND I THINK WE ALL KNEW THAT THERE WOULD BE CHALLENGES I THINK LIKE ANY. GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT AGREEMENT OF THERE ARE A VARIETY OF CONSIDERATIONS THAT WE ALL MAKE INCLUDING -- GOING BACK TO THE MEMBERS PLAIN WHAT. WAS THE PRODUCT OF FOUR YEARS OF NEGOTIATION AND I THINK -- THE TRIBE AGREED TO THE TERMS THAT WERE IMPORTANT TO US AND I THINK THIS WAS IMPORTANT TO THE LEADERSHIP AND THE MEMBERSHIP TO GET SOMETHING TO SHOW THAT. THAT WHAT THEY GAVE UP WAS WAS WORTH WHAT THEY GOT. WHEN I THINK THAT SOME THAT THAT'S REALLY GOOD COUNSELOR DID YOU? ONE YES I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT THAT -- FOR THAT RECORD FOR THE RECORD JUDGE JAMES KAWAHARA LEGAL COUNSEL FOR INVITING WANNA OF YOUR LAST YEAH THAT'S IT -- LEGAL COUNSEL FOR THE TRIBE -- TO GET YOUR QUESTION DIRECTLY -- THIS PROVIDES OPTIONS FOR THE TRIBE -- OBVIOUSLY THE THEY WILL NOT. WANT TO CANNIBALIZE OUR OWN MARKETS SO IT'LL JUST GIVE THEM OPTIONS GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE RESERVATION. AND THAT THEY HAVE -- ACCESS TO HIGHWAY SEVENTY SIX OF TO ENTRY POINTS ON THE RESERVATION SO THIS WAS JUST GIVE OPTIONS THAT THERE'S NO CRIME. PLANT HAVE THREE FACILITIES YES. WHILE I APPRECIATE THAT. MR DON'T MAYBE YOU COULD ALSO ADDRESS FOR THE COMMITTEE THE THE PAYMENT PROVISION -- THAT'S WITH INSIDE THE BODY OF FOR THE ARTIST YOU HAVE. OR THE TNG F. ON FUNDS MAYBE COULD HELP EXPLAIN THAT FOR EVERYONE HOW'S IT GOING TO WORK. BUT YES SIR SO -- CONSISTENT WITH THAT THE COMPACT THAT WE DID -- LAST YEAR WHERE THAT -- THAT THE DEVICE LIMIT IS LOWER THAN SOME OF THE ONES THAT WE'VE DONE IT AND SPECIFICALLY DEALING WITH TRIBES THAT IN THIS CASE SIR RECIPIENTS OF THE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND OR HAVE SMALLER FACILITIES. WE RECOGNIZE THAT UP TO TWELVE HUNDRED SLOTS. WE BELIEVE THE TRIBE SHOULD BE ABLE TO RETAIN THAT THE FUNDS THAT THAT GENERATE FROM THAT THE GAMING FOR THAT THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY NEED WHETHER IT'S THE EDUCATION THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT FOR THEIR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WHATEVER IT IS THE TRIBAL GOVERNMENT. BELIEVES IS APPROPRIATE FOR INVESTING IN. IN THEIR OWN GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS BEYOND THAT IF THEY GET ABOVE TWELVE HUNDRED THEN -- THE THE TRIBE WOULD BE CONTRIBUTING A PERCENTAGE OF ITS REVENUE FROM. WITH THE REDUCTION FOR THE THE KINDS OF CREDITS THAT AGAIN THAT WE YOU'VE SEEN IN THE AND OTHER RECENT COMPACT ALONG THE LINES OF THE THINGS THAT YOU DESCRIBE SWEPT WHETHER IT'S FOR PAYMENTS -- TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE DISTRICTS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OR FIRE OR INVESTMENTS IN IN -- ON RESERVATION ACTIVITIES WHETHER IT'S WATER CONSERVATION RENEWABLE ENERGY HERE OR OTHER KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE THINK ARE BENEFICIAL NOT JUST FOR THE MEMBERSHIP BUT FOR THE OVERALL COMMUNITY. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER AN OPPORTUNITY. AREN'T. ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS YOU'D LIKE TO AD -- IF NOT I DON'T THINK I HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS I KNOW COUPLE MEMBERS CAME IN AFTER THE FACT THAT THE OF ME ASKING IF WE WERE.

AGAIN AN AMENDMENT TO THE TRIBAL STATE GAMING COMPACT. THAT IS BEFORE US -- WHICH WAS EXECUTED AGAIN ON AUGUST FIRST TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BETWEEN GOVERNOR BROWN. ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE CORD HOOK. KARUK THANK YOU TRIED. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE TRIBE IS THE SECOND LARGEST TRIBE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH APPROXIMATELY THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED MEMBERS. THIS IS TRIVIA INFORMATION THAT EVERYBODY BEST REMEMBER. TODAY WE WILL HEAR FROM THE PRINCIPAL ARCHITECTS OF THIS CONTACT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE CHAIR OF THE TRIED. THE AMENDED CONTACT WITH THE GROUP -- TRIED CONFORMS THE PROVISIONS OF THE TWENTY FOURTEEN CONTACT. WITH THE STATE REGARDING WORKERS COMPENSATION. TO THOSE OF MORE RECENT RATIFIED CONTACTS THE TRIBE HAS RECENTLY OPENED AND IS CURRENTLY OPERATING DE GAMING FACILITY. S. B.. TWENTY S. B. TEN FIFTY ONE BY SENATOR DON WHICH IS PENDING ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR IS UP FOR RATIFICATION IS A RATIFICATION BILL FOR THIS CONTACT AND AT SOME POINT WILL BE TAKEN UP. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE ENTIRE BODY OF THE SIMPLY I WOULD LIKE TO ONCE AGAIN THANK OUR WITNESSES IN ADVANCE FOR TAKING TIME OUT OF THEIR BUSY SCHEDULES. TO BE WITH US TODAY AND RECOGNIZE THAT. THERE IS NO ACTION TAKEN HERE TODAY IT WILL BE JUST THAT ON THE FLOOR [inaudible] SO. MR DON'T. WOULD YOU LIKE THE LEADOFF YES SIR THANK YOU VICE CHAIRMAN THAT AS YOU'VE INDICATED THE TRIBE HAS. A COMPACT THAT WAS NEGOTIATED RATIFY THE TWENTY THIRTEEN BENEFIT SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN SINCE THEN ONE OF THE PROVISIONS THAT WE'VE INCLUDED IN OUR OUR COMPACTS. HOME ADDRESSES WORKERS COMPENSATION BY GIVING THE TRIBE AN OPTION THEY CAN ELECT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STATE PROGRAM OR THEY CAN -- OPERATED INDEPENDENT THE COMPARABLE SYSTEM AND WE PROVIDE DETAILS WITH REGARD TO THAT THE COMPONENTS OF THAT COMPARABLE SYSTEM -- THAT PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS JUST INCLUDE THE LANGUAGE THAT WE THE SUCH INCLUDED AND I THINK ALL OF OUR CONTACTS. TWENTY FIFTEEN INTO THE CREW CON -- THAT'S ALL IT DOES I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT -- THE TRIBE IS YOU CAN'T IT HAS RECENTLY OPENED -- THEIR THEIR GAMING FACILITY YEAH I THINK THAT IT'S A BIG DEAL NOT JUST FOR THAT FOR THE TRIBE I THINK 30% OF THAT. THE EMPLOYEES ARE TRIBAL MEMBERS -- BUT IT'S ALSO A BIG DEAL FOR THE COMMUNITY -- YOU KNOW CLEARLY IT'S NOT A TO SEE A LOT OF ECONOMIC INVESTMENT AND I THINK HAVING THAT. THE AND ENTERTAINMENT OPTIONS AS WELL AS THE JOB OF THE THINGS THAT -- GAMING FACILITY BRINGS IS A BIG THING FOR A WAY WEAKENED SISKIYOU COUNTY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF YOU EVER REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE TRIBE YEAH GOOD MORNING MELANIE GAVE US WITH THE TIME CRUZ COMPANY -- ON BEHALF OF KARUK AND CHAIRMAN AND A VERY WHO UNFORTUNATELY HAD TO LEAVE THE CAPITAL EARLY. TRAVEL PURPOSES SO IF ME TODAY -- THIS IS THE FIRST AMENDMENT TO OUR TRIBAL STATE COMPACT AND AS YOU HAD EARLIER STATED WE ARE THE SECOND LARGEST TRIED TO CALIFORNIA WITH OVER. THIRTY EIGHT HUNDRED MEMBERS LOCATED NEAR THE OREGON BORDER IN CALIFORNIA AND TO PROVIDE JOBS THE RECENTLY OPENED THE GAMING FACILITY. AND I WAS OPEN IN APRIL TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND HIGHS AND HAD AN IMMEDIATE BOOST TO THE LOCAL ECONOMY. FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE BEGAN HIRING EARLY TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE HELD A JOB FAIR FOR TWO HUNDRED JOBS AND EAT SHOWED UP. I'M SIMILAR TO OTHER TRIBES ARE TWENTY FOURTEEN COMPACT IS A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE ABOUT OUR SOVEREIGNTY WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF CERTAIN. AYE PROTECTION STANDARDS -- AND PRESENTLY IT COSTS MORE FOR US TO ENSURE A GAMING EMPLOYEE THAT IT DOES FOR A MEMBER OF OUR FIRE CARILLO. AND SO WE'RE LOOKING TO AMEND THE WORKERS BECAUSE AND THESE HIGH INSURANCE COSTS ARE UNRELATED TO THE JOB AND COST THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WHICH RESULT IN A LOSS OF FUNDS TO OUR ESSENTIAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES. AND OTHER GAMING TRIBES HAVE ENCOUNTERED THE SAME ISSUE AND AS A RESULT THE LEGISLATURE HAS SINCE GIVEN IT RATIFIED SIMPLE COMPACT AMENDMENTS THAT PERMITTED TRIED TO OPERATE ITS OWN WORKERS COMPENSATION. SYSTEM IF IT COMPLIES WITH STRINGENT SURE ITS REQUIREMENTS AND PROVIDES A SYSTEM OF REDRESS FOR WORKPLACE INJURIES. SO THE FIRST AMENDMENT YOUR TWENTY FOURTEEN COMPACT REFLECTS THESE ALTERNATIVE REQUIREMENTS AND WOULD ALLOW US TO ACHIEVE PARITY WITH OTHER TYPES IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE OFFER OUR THANKS TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS AS WELL AS THE AT YOUR COMMITTEES YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU DID VERY GOOD JOB REPRESENTING THE CHAIRMAN [inaudible] MISTER GRIFFIN. I YES MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AGAIN JACK RIBBON WITH UNITE HERE THE HOTEL AND CASINO WORKERS UNION AND WE SUPPORT. THE GA CAREW COMPAQ AS WE DID SEVERAL YEARS AGO. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WILL OPEN UP THE FLOOR TO SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT OF THIS -- MEASURE. SCENE NINE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. AGAIN SEEN NINE QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS [inaudible] SEEING NONE. I JUST HAVE. ONE TIME THIRTY SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT HUNDRED ROUGHLY MEMBERS IN THE IN THE TRIED THAT'S A HUGE NUMBER. HOW LARGE IS THE COMMUNITY THAT IT SERVES IN THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA WOULD YOU SAY [inaudible] ONE YEAH WELL THAT IT'S ACTUALLY A LARGE RESERVATION I'LL JUST ACKERMAN ALL AS A SO THAT THE GAMING FACILITIES LOCATED. WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS OF A WEEK AND THERE'S THERE'S HOUSING RIGHT THERE IS RIGHT OFF OF I FIVE IT'S NEXT TO SEE YOU COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS. THAT THE MAIN TRIBAL ADMINISTRATION BUILDING IS IN ISN'T HAPPY CAMP WHICH IS PROBABLY AN HOUR PLUS. AWAY AND THEN THEY ALSO HAVE LAND IN ORLEANS WHICH IS ANOTHER. HOUR PLUS AWAY SO IT ISN'T JUST THE SIZE OF THAT. THE MEMBERSHIP OR THE SIZE OF THE RESERVATION BUT THAT THE FACT THAT IT IS SO. DISTRIBUTED YEAH SO A LOT OF CHALLENGES IN AND WHERE WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THIS AMENDMENT IN THE COMPACT THE GAMING FACILITY HELPS THE GOVERNMENT ADDRESS. THAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF THE QUESTIONS JUST THE EXPANSIVENESS OF THE AREA. GEOGRAPHICALLY THAT YOU SERVED AS HE HUMONGOUS AND SO THE OPPORTUNITIES. ARE TREMENDOUS SO CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR OPENING AND UP MUCH SUCCESS -- TO YOU. THINK SO WITH THAT THAT THIS CONCLUDES OUR PUBLIC HEARING ON ALL OF THE CONTACTS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY STATED. AND I APPRECIATE ALL THE MEMBERS FOR BEING HERE AND ALL THE STAFF SUPPORT. OUR THANKS TO THE GOVERNOR AND HIS STAFF FOR ALL OF YOUR EXCELLENT WORK ONCE AGAIN MISTER DILLON UNIT YOU SHINE. SO WELL SO ANYWAY. THIS IS IT EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TODAY [inaudible] SO [inaudible] ANYWAY. HEARING IS CLOSED
