THE LONGEST AND STRONGEST DEMOCRACY IN HISTORY. AND I FOUND MYSELF REPEATING A COMMON REFRAIN. DEMOCRACY IS ALWAYS A WORK IN PROGRESS. FOR OUR COUNTRY AND FOR ANY COUNTRY. AND IN DURING DEMOCRACY MUST POSSESS THE ABILITY TO ADAPT AND MODERNIZE TO BE NIMBLE AND RESPONSIVE TO CHANGING TIMES WHILE IT HEARING THE TIME TESTED PRINCIPLES.

MR GVERNOR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE HONOR OF YOUR PRESENCE HERE TODAY. TODAY'S PROCEEDINGS IS MORE THAN TRADITION OR SYMBOLISM. THAT EACH BRANCH OF STATE GOVERNMENT COMES TOGETHER AS WE ARE HERE TODAY AND YET REMAINS DISTINCT AND SOVEREIGN IN ITS OWN RIGHT. IT IS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR DEMOCRACY. IT IS THE ESSENTIAL PRECAUTION IN FAVOR OF LIBERTY AS MADISON WROTE IN THE FEDERALIST. FORTY SEVEN BECAUSE THE ACCUMULATION OF ALL POWERS LEGISLATIVE EXECUTIVE AND JUDICIARY IN THE SAME HANDS. IS THE VERY DEFINITION OF TYRANNY DAY WE RENEW OUR COMMITMENT TO THAT ESSENTIAL PRECAUTION WE ARE RESPECTFULLY TOGETHER AND YET PROBABLY DISTINCT. WITH THAT IS MY GREAT PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE CALIFORNIA'S SUPREME COURT JUSTICES MAIN CHEN [inaudible] CAROL CORRIGAN [inaudible] GOODWIN LIU. MARIANO FLORENTINO QUAY ARE. LEON -- KRUEGER.

AND ALSO MEMBERS OF THE JUDICIARY INCLUDING THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL BENCH BAR COALITION AND OPEN COURTS COALITION I'M GRATEFUL THAT SOME OF MY BELOVED FAMILY MEMBERS ARE HERE MY HUSBAND MARK. MY IN LAWS BUREAU AND DOROTHY MY SISTER IN LAW VICKI AND FRIENDS. THE MOTTO OF THE SENATE. IS TO GUARD THE LIBERTY OF THE PEOPLE. THIS MOTTO IS IN ACCORD WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY THAT LINK IN ENVISIONED WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE BY THE PEOPLE AND FOR THE PEOPLE. OUR CALIFORNIA THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT STRIVE TO PUT THE PEOPLE'S RIGHTS. PROTECTIONS AND FREEDOMS FIRST. EVEN WITHOUR DISTINCT ROLES AND DIFFERENT POWERS AND THE NECESSARY CHECKS AND BALANCES OF GOOD GOVERNMENT WE ALL ARE GUARDIANS OF THE PEOPLE'S LIBERTY. EACH GENERATION ENDEAVORS TO CHANGE THE PRESENT FOR THE FUTURE CASE IN POINT. WE ARE APPROACHING THE ONE HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY. OF THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT GIVING WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE. GENERATIONS FOUGHT FOR THIS RIGHT AND ITS IMPORT CANNOT BE OVERSTATED BECAUSE THE RIGHT TO VOTE. IS THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE. IS THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AND IT'S THE RIGHT TO BE HEARD. ALL ARE NECESSARY ELEMENTS IF WE ARE TO OUR BIRTHRIGHT TO JUSTICE. MANY OF US ARE HERE TODAY BECAUSE OF THE SACRIFICE AND DETERMINATION OF THOSE PAST GENERATIONS. SO TODAY IN SPEAKING TO YOU ABOUT THE STATE OF THE JUDICIARY I START WITH THE FACT. THAT ABOUT ONE THIRD OF OUR JUSTICES AND JUDGES ARE RELATIVELY NEW TO THEIR POSITIONS. THANKS TO GOVERNOR BROWN WHO BREATHE NEW LIFE INTO THE JUDICIARY WITH SIX HUNDRED PLUS JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS TWO HUNDRED OF THOSE IN HIS FINAL YEAR. IN THE LAST YEAR THESE NEW APPOINTEES SELF REPORT THAT 41% ARE NON WHITE. AND OVER HALF OF THESE APPOINTMENTS ARE FEMALE. THIS IS TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THE JUDICIARY NOW IS MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE IN EVERY WAY. WE'VE ALSO MADE PROGRESS WITH YOUR HELP. BECAUSE WE ARE MORE FOCUSED ON OUR GOALS AND OUR PLANS AND WE HAVE WHAT WE CALL ACCESS THREE D. VISION FOR ACCESS TO JUSTICE. THE ACCESS TO JUSTICE BE THREE DIMENSIONAL ONE OF COURSE THAT IT BE PHYSICAL FOR YOUR DAY IN COURT. TO TO BE REMOTE -- ONLINE SO YOU CAN ACCESS INFORMATION AND TOOLS AND KNOWLEDGE AND THREE THAT IT BE EQUAL ACCESS. SO PHYSICAL ACCESS IS OF COURSE COURTROOMS IN COURTHOUSES WITH YOUR HELP WE MAINTAIN OVER FIVE HUNDRED COURTHOUSES IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE ARE CONSTRUCTING TEN NEW SAFE AND SECURE COURTHOUSES IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. REMOTE ACCESS MEANS ONLINE ACCESS IT MEANS YOU MAY CONDUCTOR LEGAL BUSINESS VIA AN APP. OR VIDEO FOR THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO DO SO. TO YOUR FUNDING OF OUR INNOVATIVE GRANT PROGRAM LOCAL COURT SERVE AS INCUBATORS FOR OVER FIFTY NEW PROJECTS THAT INCLUDE THE NEW TECHNOLOGY. SO THAT WE MAY EVENTUALLY TEST THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY AND USE IT STATE WIDE. THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY INCLUDES THINGS LIKE A MOBILE APP. A MULTI LINGUAL SELF HELP WEBSITE. AVATAR GUIDES A VIDEO HEARINGS AND VIDEO REMOTE INTERPRETERS. THESE GRANTS ALLOW THE JUDICIARY TO PROTOTYPE AND BETA TEST THESE NEW PROGRAMS A NEW POLICIES IN NEW PROJECTS. SO THAT WE CAN REPLICATE THEM STATEWIDE FOR OTHER COURTS. BECAUSE IMPROVING ONLINE ACCESS TO JUSTICE IT MAKES SENSE IN CALIFORNIA MANY CALIFORNIANS EXPECT THIS KIND OF SERVICE FROM THEIR COURTS. YET WE MUST ALWAYS REMEMBER AND UNDERSTAND THAT TECHNOLOGY CAN ONLY TAKE US SO FAR. JUSTICE WILL ALWAYS REQUIRE A HUMAN TOUCH WE WILL ALWAYS NEED JUDGES AND COURT STAFF AND LAWYERS TO LISTEN TO PEOPLE IN CRISIS. TO GUIDE THEM AND TO HELP. AN ESTIMATED FOUR AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE COME TO COURT EACH YEAR WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY SEEKING JUSTICE THESE FOLKS NEED HELP TO ACCESS OUR COURT SYSTEM AND TO PRESS THEIR RIGHTS. THAT'S WHY I'VE ADVOCATED FOR WAY FINDERS OR WHAT WE CALL COURT NAVIGATORS. THIS IS EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE THE THIRD COMPONENT OF ACCESS THREE D.. IN THE STATE AS DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE LIKE CALIFORNIA WE WILL ALWAYS BE WORKING ON ACCESS TO JUSTICE. FOR EXAMPLE A FEW YEARS AGO WE DECIDED TO STUDY THE NEED FOR LANGUAGE ACCESS IN THE COURTS WE ISSUED A REPORT. WE MADE RECOMMENDATIONS AND RECENTLY WE IMPLEMENTED THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS THANKS TO THE EXCEPTIONAL LEADERSHIP OF SUPREME COURT JUSTICE TINO QUAY ARE. YOU KNOW WILL TELL YOU IT'S BECAUSE OF MY OUTSTANDING TASK FORCE COMMITTEE WHICH IS TRUE -- BUT THANKS TO THEIR EFFORT. AND YOUR FUNDING WE NOW PROVIDE INTERPRETERS IN CRITICAL CIVIL CASES LIKE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. CHILD CUSTODY ELDER ABUSE ANY FICTIONS WE'VE EXPANDED THE USE OF MULTI LINGUAL SIGNAGE IN THE COURTS AND WE ALSO NOW PROVIDE INTERPRETERS AT SERVICE DESKS NOW. BUT IS JUST AS QUICKLY. TOLD US THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL JUST LAST WEEK WE HAVE MUCH MORE WORK TO DO. BUT WE ARE COMMITTED TO DOING THAT WORK. EVERY GENERATION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING DEMOCRACY AND NEW. A DEMOCRACY THAT IS RELEVANT AND RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF THAT GENERATION ONE THAT EXPANDS UPON. AND COMPLETES THE PREVIOUS WORK OF THE PRIOR GENERATION. IN MY VIEW THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT THAT BEGAN IN THE FIFTIES REMAINS UNFINISHED. DALY WE HEAR IN THE NEWS ABOUT ACTIONS LIKE HASH TAG BLACK LIVES MATTER HASH TAG ME TO HASH TAG TIME'S UP. JUST TO NAME A FEW. FREDERICK DOUGLASS SAID. WHERE JUSTICE IS DENIED? WHERE POVERTY IS ENFORCED IGNORANCE PREVAILS WHERE ANY ONE CLASS IS MADE TO FEEL THAT SOCIETY IS AN ORGANIZED CONSPIRACY? TO ALL PRESS ROB OR DEGRADE THEM. NEITHER PERSON NOR PROPERTY IS SAFE. WE IN THE JUDICIARY RECOGNIZE THIS AND WE NEED TO WORK ON OUR OWN CHALLENGES. WE MUST ENSURE THAT INCOME INEQUALITY DOESN'T TRANSLATE INTO A TWO TIERED JUSTICE SYSTEM. WE MUST ENSURE THAT FINES AND FEES NO LONGER FALL ON THOSE LEAST ABLE TO AFFORD THEM. WE MUST ENSURE THAT MINOR TRAFFIC OFFENSES DON'T TURN FOR DRIVERS INTO POOR CRIMINALS. WE MUST ENSURE THAT WE KEEP OUR WORKPLACES SAFE AND FREE FROM DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT IN THAT WE TREAT EACH OTHER. AT THE PUBLIC WE SERVE WITH RESPECT. WE NEED OUR CHALLENGES IN THE JUDICIARY BY CONVENING THE MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE DELIBERATING THE FACTS AND THE LAW AND THEN PURSUING RECOMMENDATIONS TO ALL THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT BECAUSE WE HAVE LEARNED. AS GOVERNOR NEWSOME SAID IN HIS STATE OF THE STATE. THAT WE GO FAR WHEN WE GO TOGETHER. SO AN EXAMPLE OF THIS CONVENING ISN'T WE CONVENED A WORK GROUP TO STUDY THE PRACTICES AND REFORM OF EXISTING PRE TRIAL DETENTION. AND WE ASK THIS TASK FORCE TO COME BACK WITH NEXT STEPS TO MAKE THIS PROCESS. FAIRER AND SAFER WE THANK GOVERNOR NEWSOME FOR HIS VISION HIS RESOLVE AND HIS COMMITMENT TO FAIRNESS AND SAFETY WITH HIS PROPOSAL OF SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. TO THE COURTS TO DEVELOP INTO EIGHT PRE TRIAL DETENTION DECISION MAKING COURTS EIGHT TO TEN COURTS AND ALL. WE ARE GRATEFUL AND I'M THANKFUL THAT I SEE ONE OF OUR PARTNERS IN THIS EFFORT HERE TODAY THE PRESIDENT OF THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA CHIEF STEPHANIE JAMES [inaudible] THE LEADER. HER COUNTY IN PRE TRIAL DETENTION REFORM. AND WE THANK PROBATION FOR THEIR PARTNERSHIP. AND FOR HELPING US LEAD THE WAY. WE THANK CHIEF JAMES AND SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP EFFORTS AND FOR GENEROUSLY SHARING THEIR TIME AND THEIR KNOWLEDGE WITH THOSE WHO ARE WILLING AND OPEN TO CHANGING THEIR PRACTICES. ANOTHER METHOD OF SHOWING OUR WAY WITH OF CONVENING IS OUR WORK GROUP ON THE PREVENTION AND DISCRIMINATION OF HARASSMENT AND ABUSE. WE HAVE A WORK GROUP THAT WILL COME BACK TO US IN THE SUMMER. WITH RECOMMENDATIONS WE HOPE JUSTICE HILL TO AND JUDGE BORE YURI TO MAKE OUR WORKPLACE SAFER. RESPECTFUL AND BETTER FOR ALL. OUR ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR MARTIN WHO SHE NOW HAS ALREADY ACTED IN THIS REGARD HE HAS MADE UNCONSCIOUS BIAS TRAINING MANDATORY FOR ALL JUDICIAL COUNCIL EMPLOYEES BECAUSE HE RECOGNIZES THE SCIENCE AS TO WHY. THAT THE FORMATION OF UNCONSCIOUS STEREO TYPES CAN AFFECT ATTITUDES ACTIONS AND BELIEVES IT ALL ENCOUNTERS WHERE WE MEET SOMEONE DIFFERENT FROM OURSELVES. I'VE ASKED MARTIN TO REVIEW OUR STATE Y. JUDICIAL EDUCATIONAL CURRICULUM. TO ENSURE THAT THIS KIND OF TRAINING IS AVAILABLE FOR JURISTS BECAUSE I PLAN ON TAKING THE FIRST CLASS. IN CLOSING I WANT TO PAY TRIBUTE TO WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH. BY NOTING THAT ONE HUNDRED YEARS AFTER GIVING US THE RIGHT TO VOTE. WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA HAVE TRULY MADE THEIR MARK. CURRENTLY OUR PRESIDENT FIRST FEMALE TO LEAD THIS AUGUST BODY. WE HAVE THIRTY SIX FEMALE LEGISLATORS. DOWN FOR MORE MAJORITY BUT WE STILL HAVE THREE CURRENT FEMALE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES. IN OUR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OUR CONTROLLER ARE TREASURER OR ALL FEMALE. THE LAST THREE FEMALE CHIEFS OF STAFF TO THE GOVERNOR FEMALE. THE CURRENT CHIEF OF STAFF TO THE GOVERNOR IS EMAIL. IN OUR FIRST PARTNER IS A FILMMAKER WRITER PRODUCER DIRECTOR AND WORKING MOM. I OFTEN MENTION THAT HAMILTON QUOTE THAT LAWS ARE A DEAD LETTER WITHOUT THE COURTS BUT THIS TIME I'M GOING TO END WITH. HAMILTON AN AMERICAN MUSICAL. NO SINGING. HAMILTON'S SISTER IN LAW ANGELICA SCHUYLER SAYS THAT SHE APPRECIATES THAT THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF EVIDENT. THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL BUT WHEN SHE MEETS THOMAS JEFFERSON SHE'S GOING TO COMPEL HIM TO PUT WOMEN IN THE SEQUEL. I SUBMIT TO YOU THAT THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT PUT US IN THE SEQUEL. AND NOW WE'RE READY FOR THE THIRD INSTALLMENT. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING CHIEF JUST TOO ONEROUS WITH YOUR PRESENCE HERE IN THE SENATE CHAMBER. ON BEHALF OF MY COLLEAGUE SPEAKER RENDON AND I WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE ADDRESS TODAY THANK YOU FOR BEING OUR GUEST TODAY AGAIN. GOVERNOR THANK YOU TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE AND THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR THANK YOU. AND TO OUR INCREDIBLE CONTROLLER BETTY THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US TODAY. AND I UNDERSTAND THERE'S A RECEPTION -- AT FOUR THIRTY AT THE LIBRARY IN COURTS BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET AND I'M ASSUMING WE'RE ALL INVITED SINCE I JUST ANNOUNCED IT TO A TO EVERYONE HERE -- BUT TO THE MEMBERS OF THE JUDICIARY AND OUR OUR LEGAL COMMUNITY I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING OUR GUEST TODAY HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY
