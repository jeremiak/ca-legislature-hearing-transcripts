SKINNER STERN STONE. AMBERG. WHAT KASKI [inaudible] HI. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE SECRETARY NOTICES THE PRESENCE OF THE QUORUM AGAIN WELCOME EVERYONE TO OUR PARDON ME. OUR FOURTH FULL BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARING FOR THIS BUDGET YEAR AND AGAIN HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY. YOU HAVE TO SAY IT LIKE THAT TO LIKE YOU'RE REALLY HAPPY HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY -- MY COACH HERE USING MY BY SHEER SEVENTEEN NIELSEN -- HAS PRESSING BUSINESS IN HIS DISTRICT TODAY AND HE WILL NOT BE WITH THIS THE FOCUS OF TODAY'S HEARING IS REALLY TO PART WE'RE LOOKING AT A PROPOSALS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOCUSING ON HEALTHCARE. FIRST BEING OF THE EXPANSION OF MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY TO YOUNG ADULTS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS. AND THE SECOND MAJOR NEW COMPONENT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS LEVERAGING THE STATE'S PURCHASING POWER TO LOWER THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR MEDI CAL AND OTHER STATE HEALTH PROGRAMS AS WELL AS THE PRIVATE MARKET. WHILE CALIFORNIA'S LED THE NATION IN X.. THERE ARE STILL MILLIONS OF OUR FELLOW RESIDENTS THAT REMAIN WITHOUT ACCESS TO ADEQUATE HEALTH COVERAGE. THE LARGEST GROUP AMONG THE POPULATION OF REMAINING UNINSURED ARE UNDOCUMENTED RESIDENTS WHO ARE IN ELIGIBLE FOR BOTH MEDICARE AL. AND PARTICIPATION THE COVER CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFIT PACKAGE. IN TODAY'S HEARINGWILL HAVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE CHARACTERISTICS AND HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF THE UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION BASED ON A RECENT REPORT. PUBLISHED BY THE CENTER FOR LABOR RESEARCH AND EDUCATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY. FOLLOWING THAT PRESENTATION APARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES WILL PROVIDE US WITH AN OVERVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO EXPAND FULL SCOPE MEDI CAL COVERAGE TO YOUNG ADULTS UP TO AGE. TWENTY SIX NEXT WE'LL DISCUSS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO LOWER THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. RISING PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS FROM NEW HIGH COST TESTING DRUGS SHARP PRICE INCREASES FOR EXISTING DRUGS AND OTHER FACTORS HAVE LED TO SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL IMPACTS ON OUR PUBLIC HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS CALIFORNIA'S FAMILIES AS WELL AS OUR BUDGET. THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES WILL PRESENT THE ACTIONS OUTLINED IN THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER TO IMPLEMENT A STATEWIDE BALL PURCHASING PROGRAM FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS WITH THE AIM OF REDUCING COSTS FOR STATE HEALTH PROGRAMS. AND ALLOWING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PRIVATE PAYERS AND HELP CONSUMERS TO BENEFIT FROM THE STATE'S PURCHASING POWER. THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES WILL THEN PRESENT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO TRANSITION MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS FROM MANAGED CARE TO FEE FOR SERVICE WITH THE AIM OF NEGOTIATING ADDITIONAL REBATES ON DRUGS PROVIDED TO MEDI CAL THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION COVERED. BENEFICIARIES. PRIOR TO OUR FIRST PRESENTATION. IS ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS -- SEEN NONE AND WITH THE TO NIELSEN NOT BE IN TODAY WILL GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED. WITH OUR INITIAL PRESENTATION. AGAIN THE TITLE OF THE REPORT IS EXPAND YOU TOWARD UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVERAGE EXPANDING MEDICAID ALL THE LOW INCOME UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS. SO IF MISS LUCIA WILL COME FOR HELLO MISS LUCIA IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE HEALTH CARE PROGRAM AT UC BERKELEY CENTER FOR LABOR RESEARCH AND EDUCATION. YOU BEING HERE AND WE'LL GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE RESEARCH TODAY OF THE AT SENATOR MITCHELL SAID MY NAME IS LAURA LEE C. I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE HEALTH CARE PROGRAM AT THE UC BERKELEY LABOR CENTER. LAST WEEK WE RELEASED IN THE RECORDS -- THAT. BOTH THE SUMMARIZE THE EXISTING RESEARCH SHOWING THE NEEDED FOR THE EXPANSION OF INSURANCE TO UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS AND ALSO ESTIMATED HOW MANY. CALIFORNIA ADULTS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE AND THEN ROLL UNDER SUCH AN EXPANSION AND I REPORT PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON AN EXPANSION TO ALL ITS OLD -- BUT THE THE FINDINGS ARE ALSO APPLICABLES OF COURSE A TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO EXPAND MEDIC HELL TO UNDOCUMENTED YOUNG ADULTS. SO WE STARTED BY PROVIDING SOME CONTEXT ABOUT A IS -- AND DOCUMENT A CALIFORNIANS ARE AND HOW INTEGRAL THEY ARE TO OUR STATE. THE RESEARCH CENTER ESTIMATES THAT THEIR TWO POINT TWO MILLION UNDOCUMENTED RESIDENTS IN THE STATE. AND THE UNDOCUMENTED WERE 9% OF THE WORK FORCE AND PAID THE THREE BILLION IN STATE AND LOCAL TAXES EACH YEAR SO THERE REALLY AND A GIRL TO OUR STATE'S ECONOMY -- THERE ALSO INTEGRAL TO OUR COMMUNITIES ABOUT TWO THIRDS HAVE LIVED IN THIS COUNTRY FOR AT LEAST A DECADE. AND MORE THAN A QUARTER HOMEOWNERS. AND THEIR INTEGRAL TO OUR OUR FAMILIES IN THE STATE ONE OUT OF SIX CALIFORNIA CHILDREN HAS AND UNDOCUMENTED PARENTS. IN SPITE OF HOW INTEGRAL THEY ARE TO OUR STATE THEY'RE LARGELY LEFT OUT OF OUR HEALTH INSURANCE SYSTEM. WITH THEIR COLLEAGUES AT THE UCLA CENTER FOR HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH WE PROJECTS THAT FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS WILL REMAIN UNANSWERED IN TWENTY TWENTY AND THAT WILL GROW TO FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION. AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND THE LARGEST GROUP OF AN INSURED IS UNDOCUMENTED. ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION. UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS ARE AN INSERT IS OUR ESTIMATE. AND THE REASON THAT UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS IN THE STATE HAVE SUCH A HIGH RATE OF AN INSURANCE IS THAT THEY'RE XCLUDED FROM FULL MEDICAID BENEFITS UNDER FEDERAL POLICY. THEY'RE ALSO NOT ELIGIBLE FOR COVERED CALIFORNIA ENROLLMENT EITHER WITH OR WITHOUT SUBSIDIES ALTHOUGH THEY CAN PURCHASE COVERAGE DIRECTLY FROM AN INSURER ALTHOUGH WITH THEIR INCOME PROFILE -- THAT COVERAGE IS AN AFFORDABLE FOR MOST WITHOUT SUBSIDIES. AND THEY'RE ALSO LESS LIKELY TO HAVE EMPLOYER SPONSORED INSURANCE BECAUSE THEY TEND TO WORK IN OCCUPATIONS AND INDUSTRIES THAT ARE LESS LIKELY TO OFFER INSURANCE TO WORKERS. AND SO ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS HAVE INCOME LOW ENOUGH THAT THEY MEET THE INCOME CRITERIA FOR MEDI CAL OR HAVE INCOME AT OR BELOW A HUNDRED AND 38% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. SO A LOT OF THE THE POLICY DISCUSSION HAS FOCUSED ON EXPANDING MEDIC HOUSE. AS A FIRST STEP TO CLOSING THE COVERAGE GAPS FOR UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS. AMONG LOW INCOME UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS AND PARTICULARLY THE THAT I'M INSURANCE RATE IS ESPECIALLY HIGH A 90% OF LOW INCOME UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS ARE UNANSWERED. BASED ON ESTIMATES BY MY COLLEAGUE PROFESSOR PERON AT UCLA. THAT'S COMPARED TO A 10% AN INSURANCE RATE FOR CITIZENS AND DOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS OF THE SAME INCOME RAINS. SOME OF THESE UNINSURED ADULTS. DO YOU HAVE RESTRICTED SCOPE MEDI CAL -- WHICH USING FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDS COVERS EMERGENCY AND PREGNANCY RELATED SERVICES. BUT UNLESS ONE IS PREGNANT RESTRICTED SCHEMATIC HELL DOES NOT COVER PREVENTIVE CARE PRIMARY CARE DRUGS AND OTHER BASIC HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND LESS THE REQUIRED FOR THE TREATMENT OF AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION. SO WE DO HAVE A TO A TO A PATCHWORK SYSTEM BETWEEN RESTRICTED SCOPE MEDI CAL AND INSERTING A COUNTY IS CERTAIN UNDOCUMENTED DULTS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR ACCESS TO CERTAIN HEALTH CARE SERVICES LIKE IN HELL THE SAN FRANCISCO AND AND MY HEALTH LA PROGRAMS -- AND ALSO -- THE SAFETY NET HEALTHCARE SYSEM PLAYS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN IN PROVIDING HEALTH CARE TO UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS. BUT IT IN SPITE OF THAT PATCHWORK SYSTEM AND DOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS. HAVE WORSE ACCESS TO CARE SO THIS IS ALSO RESEARCH FOR MY COLLEAGUE AT UCLA SHOWING THAT UNDOCUMENTED LOW INCOME ADULTS -- A USUAL SOURCE OF CARE THE LOT HIGHER THAN THE 24% OF THEIR CITIZEN UNDOCUMENTED COUNTERPARTS IN THE SAME INCOME RAINS. AND IN TH REPORT WE OFFER OTHER EXAMPLES FROM THE THAT THE RESEARCH THAT SHOW THE WORST ACCESS TO CARE THAT THE THIS POPULATION PIECES. A BUT THE THE THE RESEARCH EVIDENCE DOES SHOW THAT WHEN PEOPLE HAVE INSURANCE THEIR ACCESS TO CARE AND THEIR HEALTH -- IS BETTER A THE THERE'S A LOT OFRESEARCH ON INSURANCE EXPANSIONS THAT HAPPENED PRIOR TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT LAKE MASSACHUSETTS STATE HEALTH REFORM. AND THEN THERE'S ALSO BEEN A LOT OF RESEARCH IN THE LAST FEW YEARS ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT MEDICAID EXPANSION. AND THE IMPACTS -- THEY'VE HAD AND AND SO IN TERMS OF THE HEALTH AND ACCESS TO CARE. HAVING INSURANCE HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED USE OF PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES PRIMARY CARE -- GETTING MORE REGULAR CARE IF YOU HAVE A CHRONIC CONDITION IMPROVED ACCESS TO TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT. A INSURANCE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO READ SPITTLE EMISSIONS AND EVEN REDUCE DEATH RATES. INSURANCE ALSO HAS BENEFITS FOR PEOPLE'S FINANCIAL SECURITY IN TERMS OF REDUCE DEBT REDUCED -- COLLECTIONS. AND AND PEOPLE REPORT FEWER PROBLEMS PAYING MEDICAL BILLS WHEN THEY HAVE INSURANCE. THERE HAS ALSO BEEN SOME RESEARCH SHOWING IMPROVED WORKFORCE PRODUCTIVITY WITH INSURANCE -- ONE STUDY SHOWED THAT PEOPLE WITH INSURANCE. MISS FEWER DAYS OF WORK. AND THERE'S RESEARCH FROM THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE THAT SHOWED. AND COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE HIGH AND INSURANCE RATES EVEN INSERTED ADULTS REPORTED MORE DIFFICULTY OBTAINING CARE AND WERE LESS SATISFIED WITH THE CARE THAT THEY RECEIVED. SO CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY TAKEN SOME BIG AND IMPORTANT STEPS TOWARDS MORE INCLUSIVE MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY POLICIES RECOGNIZING THE VALUE THAT INSURANCE HAS. A USING STATE FUNDS OF MEDIC HAL OFFERS FULL BENEFITS -- TO LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENTS WHO'VE BEEN IN THE COUNTRY LESS THAN FIVE YEARS. TWO ADULTS WITH DHAKA A DEFERRED ACTION OR CHILDHOOD ARRIVALS AND STARTING IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TO ALL LOW INCOME CHILDREN REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS. SO NOW 200- AND FIFTY THOUSAND UNDOCUMENTED KIDS IN THE STATE HAVE FULL MEDICAL BENEFITS AND MANY OF THOSE WERE ALREADY ENROLLED IN RESTRICTED SCOPE MEDI CAL PRIOR TO THE EXPANSION AND WE'RE AUTOMATICALLY TRANSITION TO THOSE FULL BENEFITS. SO I. ESTIMATE THAT APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT ONE FIVE MILLION UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS IN THE STATE WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR FULL MEDICAL BENEFITS IF A AND EXPANSION OCCURRED -- OF THOSE NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO THOUSAND OR THE VAST MAJORITY ARE ALREADY AND ROLLED IN RESTRICTED SCOPE MEDI CAL. AND THIS IS SIGNIFICANT FOR TWO REASONS COULD BE AUTOMATICALLY TRANSITION TO FULL COVERAGE ON THE FIRST DAY THE POLICY WAS EFFECTIVE -- BUT IT ALSO MEANS THAT THE THE INVESTMENT OF THE STATE WOULD MAKE AN PREVENTIVE AND PRIMARY CARE WOULD BUILD ON THE EXISTING FEDERAL AND STATE SPENDING THAT'S ALREADY OCCURRING FOR EMERGENCY IN PREGNANCY RELATED SERVICES. SO THERE I ESTIMATED THAT APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND WHO WOULD BE ELIGIBLE BUT ARE NOT CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN RESTRICTED SCOPE MEDI CAL. AND THERE'S THESE OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW MANY OF THOSE WOULDN'T ROLL BUT I HAVE ASSUME THAT 50%. WITH WITH NEARLY AND ENROLLIN MEDIC HOW AND THAT THAT'S INTENDED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT A SMALL NUMBER OF UNDOCUMENTED LOW INCOME ADULTS DO YOU HAVE A PRIVATE INSURANCE MOSTLY. EMPLOYER SPONSORED INSURANCE ROUGHLY A HUNDRED THOUSAND LOW INCOME UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS HAVE PRIVATE INSURANCE. AND THERE IS THERE IS SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT ALL OF THE ELIGIBILITY AND ENROLLMENT ESTIMATES ÐAUSE ASK. OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR UNDOCUMENTED STATUS THE HOUSE TO BE INFERRED AFTER THE FACT BY RESEARCHERS SO THERE IS UNCERTAINTY BOTH ABOUT THE OVERALL SIZE OF THE UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION IN THE CITY. ENDS THEIR INCOME DISTRIBUTION. SO WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED A IN TERMS OF IN ROMANS IN TERMS OF NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO THOUSAND ADULTS TRANSITIONING TO FULL BENEFITS FROM RESTRICTED SCOTT MEDI CAL. AND ROUGHLY A HUNDRED THOUSAND NEARLY AND ROLLING THAT'S WHAT I CALLED SCENARIO ONE IN IN IN IN MY REPORT THAT WOULD BE A TOTAL OF ONE POINT ZERO FIVE MILLION. UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS AND ROLLING. I ALSO -- CONSIDERED A SECOND SCENARIO WHICH I CALLED SCENARIO TO THAT THAT RELATES TO FEDERAL PROPOSALS AROUND PUBLIC CHARGE. SO IN OCTOBER THE A PROPOSED TO THE TO TOUGHEN AND GREATLY EXPANDS AN EXISTING POLICY. ALL THE PUBLIC CHARGE RULE AND THIS WOULD MEAN THAT IF THIS GOES INTO A FACT THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COULD DENY PEOPLE GREEN CARDS ARE VISA. VISAS BASED ON THEIR USE OF CERTAIN PUBLIC PROGRAMS INCLUDING THE MEDICAID. AND THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THIS IF THE RULE IS FINALIZED -- THAT IT WOULD HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT ON IMMIGRANT FAMILIES IN TERMS OF THEIR ENROLLMENT PUBLIC PROGRAMS -- INCLUDING AMONG THOSE NOT DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THE RULE THE RULE IS VERY COMPLEX THERE'S LIKELY TO BE A LOT OF CONFUSION AND FEAR -- AND AND BASED ON EXPERIENCE WITH WELFARE REFORM IN THE NINETIES THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THAT COULD BE A BROADER A CHILLING EFFECTS. AND SO. IT IN OUR RESEARCH WITH UCLA ON ON THIS. BECAUSE PUBLIC CHARGE RULE AND AS A HIGH AND THIS IN A MOMENT SCENARIO. WE ASSUMES THAT UP. TO THE IN ROMAN COULD DROP BY UP AMONG CERTAIN IMMIGRANT FAMILIES -- AND OTHER RESEARCHERS NATIONALLY MADE A SIMILAR ASSUMPTION IN THEIR ANALYSIS. AND SO OF A IN TERMS OF APPLYING THAT ASSUMPTION TO AND DOCUMENTED OLD SPECIFICALLY I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THE PUBLIC CHARGE TESTS WOULD NOT APPLY IT'S TO EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES. AND IT ALSO WOULD NOT APPLY TO STATE FUNDED BENEFITS OF THE THAT ARE NOT CASH ASSISTANCE -- HOWEVER THE THE BROADER CHILLING EFFECTS BECAUSE THE RULE IS SO COMPLEX -- IS LIKELY TO ALSO APPLIES TO UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS BOTH IN TERMS OF RESTRICTED SCOPE MEDI CAL ENROLLMENT AND IF AN EXPANSION OCCURS IN TERMS OF FULL SCOPE BENEFITS. IT'S NOT CLEAR WHEN THIS THIS CHILLING EFFECT WOULD HAPPEN THE RULE HAS NOT BEEN FINALIZED IT'S NOT CLEAR WHEN IT WOULD BE EFFECTIVE IF IT IS FINALIZED. AND ALSO -- HOW HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE FOR THIS CHILLING EFFECTIVE FULLY OCCUR -- OF THESE THE SECOND SCENARIO IS REALLY INTENDED TO SIGNIFY AND SO THAT THIS PROPOSED PUBLIC CHARGE RULE NOT ONLY THREATENS OUR CURRENT LEVEL OF MEDIC HELLO ENROLLMENT -- BUT COULD HINDER THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO GET CLOSER TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. LESLIE -- IN TERMS OF WHO IT IN THE ROLE OF THE UNDER AN EXPANSION MOST OF THOSE WHO WOULD IN ROLE WOULD BE WORKING NEEDS A NON DISABLED ADULTS. ABOUT THE ESTIMATE THAT ABOUT 2% OF THOSE WHO WOULD IN ROLE WOULD BE SENIOR IS OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE AND THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE SHARE OF THE OVERALL UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION THAT SIXTY FIVE OR OLDER. AND THE FEW WOULD BE DISABLED -- BECAUSE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS HAVE A LOWER RATE OF A DISABILITY THAN OTHER WORKING AGE ADULTS. AND FINALLY AYE ESTIMATE THAT AROUND A HUNDRED AND FOUR THOUSAND YOUNG ADULTS WOULD AND ROLL UNDER AN EXPANSION. SO JUST TO SUM UP UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS ARE THE LARGEST GROUP OF UNINSURED AND LOW INCOME UNDOCUMENTED. HAVE A PARTICULARLY HIGH AND INSURANCE RATE OF 90%. IN THE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THIS IS A GROUP THAT HAS BURST ACCESS TO CARE -- BUT THE THE THE READ SHARON'S CAN IMPROVE THAT ACCESS AND IT CAN ALSO IMPROVE HEALTH AND FINANCIAL SECURITY AND WORKFORCE PRODUCTIVITY. OF THE ESTIMATE THAT ONE POINT ONE FIVE MILLION ADULTS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE ARE ALREADY -- IN RESTRICTED SCOTT MEDI CAL AND COULD BE AUTOMATICALLY TRANSITIONS AND DEPENDING ON WHAT HAPPENS WITH FEDERAL IMMIGRATION POLICY AND HOW AND PEOPLE RESPOND TO THAT IN TERMS OF THEIR ENROLLMENT DECISIONS. BETWEEN SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND AND ONE POINT ZERO FIVE MILLION COULD IN RAW. A AND THAT WOULD MEAN A REDUCTION IN THE STATE'S UNINSURED POPULATION BY UP TO ONE QUARTER. I WELCOME YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER MONEY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IN THANK YOU FOR THIS EXCELLENT OVERVIEW -- YOU TALKED ABOUT THE RESPECTIVE IMPACT TO THE PUBLIC CHARGE REGULATIONS OF THE PROPOSED EXPANSION OF OF THOSE. THAT DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA SHOWING A CURRENT. CHILLING EFFECT IN THE COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT PEOPLE AREN'T WAITING STATE THEY'RE ALREADY. PULLING BACK FROM PROGRAMS THEY MIGHT CURRENTLY BE ELIGIBLE. FOR BECAUSE OF THE FEAR THAT IN THE COMMUNITY OF ADVERSE IMMIGRATION IMPACT. HE I HAVE IN A I'VE I'VE ONLY LOOKED IN MEDI CAL I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT CONFERENCE OROTHER PUBLIC PROGRAMS THAT COULD BE AFFECTED -- AND IN TERMS OF MEDI CAL ENROLLMENTS -- THERE HAS BEEN A A SLIGHT DECLINE IN OVERALL MEDI CAL ENROLLMENTS AND AM A SLIGHTLY LARGER DECLINE AMONG. THOSE IN RESTRICTED SCOPE BUT A IS BOTH THE KINDS HAVE BEEN IN THE RANGE OF A FEW PERCENTAGE POINTS AND THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT ENROLLMENT LEVELS LIKE. THE STRONG ECONOMY WE HAVE RIGHT NOW LIKE THE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE AND SO IT'S HARD TO DISENTANGLE -- WHAT THE FACTS AND THE HI MINTA FEAR IS HAVING ON ENROLLMENTS? THANK YOU AND THEN WITH RESPECT TO THE RESTRICTED SCOPE ELIGIBILITY. FOR PREGNANT HOMES -- YOU INCLUDE THEM ALSO IN THE IN THE CATEGORY THE ARE CONCERNED -- COULD BE IMPACTED BY THE PUBLIC CHARGE -- AMBER STATION IF YOU WILL YES THE THE LEGAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE PUBLIC CHARGE REAL FOR PREGNANT WOMEN ARE ARE MORE COMPLICATED TO RULE THE PROPOSAL DOES SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDE EMERGENCY MEDICAID BENEFITS BUT DOES NOT EXCLUDE PIC PREGNANCY RELATED BENEFITS BUT I THINK THERE IS SOME QUESTION ABOUT. WOMEN WHO ARE INVOLVED IN IN PREGNANCY RELATED SERVICES FOR A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME WITH THE BE PENALIZED UNDERTHE PART PUBLIC CHARGE TEST -- BUT I HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY IN MY ANALYSIS FOR PREGNANT WOMEN THAN. FOR OTHER ADULTS THANK YOU KNOW I THINK THE CONCERN IS. EVEN IF REGULATIONS CARVE OUT -- PROTECT. ACCESS OR ELIGIBILITY. THE THIS DIG MONTH OF JUST FEAR IN THE COMMUNITY -- HAS THE POTENTIAL TO OVERRIDE THAT ELIGIBILITY WITH PEOPLE. WANTING TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF SAFETY AND NOT ACCESSING -- PROGRAMS THEY MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE FOR RATE THE RULE IS EXTREMELY COMPLEX THEY CAN'T TELL ME TELL YOU HOW MANY HOURS I SPENT ON CALLS WITH OTHER RESEARCHERS ALL OF US TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE IN AND SO THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF CONFUSION AND FEAR -- ANDS -- IT M. PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THE RULE BECAUSE THEY ALREADYHAVE A GREEN CARD OR MAY NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET A GREEN CARD. A A COULD EXPERIENCE THIS CHILLING EFFECT AND AND AND THERE COULD BE A CHILLING EFFECT ON PUBLIC PROGRAMS THAT ARE NOT NAMED IN THE RULE AS WELL. IF I MAY JUST ASK IN ANOTHER pPRESENTATION THE HEALTH AND LIST THE BENEFITS OF THOSE WHO DO HAVE INSURANCE FROM ACCESS TO PREVENTIVE CARE. PRIMARY CARE SERVICES -- AND A NUMBER OF BENEFITS -- MEASURED IN THESE CATEGORIES. DO YOU HAVE. FOUR DO YOU HAVE OR IS THERE ANY INDEX THAT ALONG WITH THIS ACCESS SHOWS. SAVINGS -- COST SAVINGS FOR PEOPLE TO GET FRONT END MEDICAL SERVICES WHO WARRANT THEN ACCESSING EMERGENCY ROOM SERVICES OR GOING ON TREATED IN HAVING AN AND TREATED. EARLY CONDITION MANIFESTS IN A FULL BLOWN -- MEDICAL CRISIS. I I THINK THE STRONGEST EVIDENCES THAT THAT PREVENTIVE AND PRIMARY CARE REALLY BENEFITS HEALTH -- THAT THE RESEARCH IS MORE MIXED ON THE AFFECT THE INSURANCE HAS ON THE USE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. ON THE ONE HAND WHEN PEOPLE GET PREVENTIVE AND PRIMARY CARE IT CAN PREVENT AND CERTAIN MORE COSTLY CARE DOWN THE LINE BUT ON THE OTHER HAND. WHEN PEOPLE DON'T HAVE INSURANCE A IT IS IT'S EXPENSIVE TO TO VISIT THE EMERGENCY ROOM -- AND SO THE THE EVIDENCE ON WHAT BUT A FACT THAT PASSED EXPANSIONS HAVE HOME EMERGENCY ROOM USES IS MIXED IN AND GENERAL I WOULD SAY THAT. THIS EXPANSION WOULD REQUIRE SOME STATE INVESTMENT RIGHT NOW I GUESS [inaudible] THE CHALLENGES. THERE'S A HUMANITARIAN SIDE OF THIS THAT WOULD SUGGEST HEALTHCARE FOR ALL. BUILD HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES REDUCES DISEASE AN ILLNESS THAT SENTRA. BUT FROM A BUDGET SIDE -- IT WOULD BE HELPFUL I THINK TO UNDERSTAND THAT ANYTHING WE MIGHT INVEST IN A FRONT END TO BROADEN AND EXPAND ACCESS TO CARE. HAS A LONG TERM BUDGET BENEFIT IS WELL AND I KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE FROM WHAT YOU JUST SAID. WE DON'T HAVE THAT DISPOSITIVE EVIDENCE AT THIS POINT THAT. I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND LOOKING AT IT STRICTLY FROM A IN BUDGET INVESTMENT POINT OF VIEW. IN OUT YEARS CAN WE REDUCE ON TO THE STATE BUDGET BY GETTING PEOPLE ENROLLED IN. PREVENTION PROGRAMS ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE AT CENTER SO MORE OF A STATEMENT THAN A QUESTION BUT IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I HOPE THAT YOU DIRECT THAT QUESTION -- TO THE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE PRIVATE FINANCE WILL BE ON THE PANEL LATER THANK YOUNG LOOK FORWARD TO THEN I THINK YOU. SENATOR BAIL. THANK YOU ON OVER HERE -- WOULD THE US. OF THAT -- THE PEOPLE IN YOUR CLASS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- UNDOCUMENTED WOULD. HEY CASH FOR THEIR HEALTHCARE AND HAS ANYBODY MEASURED. THAT ISSUE BECAUSE IN MY COMMUNITY AND SALAS A IT'S PREVALENT WAY THAT PEOPLE PAY FOR THEIR HEALTHCARE. AND A ITS. COURSE DEPENDED ON WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE THE CASH. OF SO HAVE YOU MEASURE THAT HAS THAT BEEN LOOKED AT ALL. N. DOCUMENTED ADULTS WHO ARE UNINSURED OFTEN STILL ARE USING SOME CARE THEY'RE JUST NOT GETTING ALL THE CARE THEY NEED AND AND SOMETIMES LIKE CARE IS THROUGH -- THE SAFETY NET SYSTEM WHETHER THAT BE PUBLIC HOSPITALS OR ARE A COMMUNITY CLINICS OR PUBLIC CLINICS. THE AND AND OFTEN IT'S PROVIDED ON A SLIDING SCALE AND AND SO THEY THEY ARE. PAYING FOR SOME OF THEIR HEALTHCARE ALREADY -- I DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC AND WAY OF THINKING YOU THINK THE PUBLIC CHARGE RULE WOULD. THE MORE PEOPLE TO ABANDON. ANY KIND OF PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM AND GO TO CASH PAYING. OF MODES TO GET THEIR HEALTH CARE TO AVOID ANY KIND OF PUBLIC CHARGE OF RULE THAT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAY IMPOSE. I A DO YOU THINK BECAUSE OF THE RULE IS SO COMPLEX AND CONFUSING THERE WILL THERE WILL BE PEOPLE WHO ARE FEARFUL AND AND DO NOT ENROLL IN AN PUBLIC PROGRAMS EVEN IF THEIR PUBLIC PROGRAMS THAT ARE NOT WOULD NOT DIRECTLY BE AFFECTED BY THE RULE. AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION MANAGERS THE LIMITED -- MEDI CAL PROGRAM. OF AND THE FACT THAT A LOT OF THE CARE IS PROVIDED WITH EMERGENCY ROOMS. HAS HAD. LIMITED MEDI CAL -- DOES AND TO A FOCUS AT ALL ON CHRONIC. ONGOING ELLEN'S ILLNESSES ARE A BRING UP MENTAL HEALTH. OF THE MERGER ROOM IS NOT EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH MENTAL HEALTH THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY DO -- CAN YOU COMMENT ON THOSE KINDS ILLNESSES THAT ARE JUST COMPLETELY NOT COVERED. BY. THIS PATCHWORK. EMERGENCY OF KIND OF SYSTEM THAT UNDOCUMENTED. INDIVIDUALS ARE USING. AND AND SPECIFICALLY CAN YOU TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH RIGHT AS A ISSUE. YES THE RESTRICTED SCOPE. A MEDIC HOW WOULD NOT COVERED THE THE SERVICES SOMEONE WOULD NEED OVER THE LONG TERM -- SOMEONE WITH A MENTAL HEALTH. AGNES SAYS AND OCCASIONS OR OTHER GRAY WOULD NOT COVER THE DRUGS THE EAT. ME IN SOME CASES COVER A LITTLE BIT OF THE CHARACTERS YOU KNOW GET THEM STABLE AND OUT OF THE ER BUT BUT NOT THE LONG TERM. THE ON GOING CARE -- THAT THEY WOULD NEEDS. AND IF THE RESEARCH IS CLEAR THAT THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE BIG VALUES OF INSURANCES IS IMPROVING ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES. IF YOU ANALYZE THE LIKE YOU HAVE THIS PROPOSAL HERE. FOR WE'RE LOOKING AT FOR COMPLETE COVERAGE AGE -- TWENTY SIX HELLO THE ON COVERED ADULTS WHEN WE STARTED THE MEDICAL SYSTEM EXPANDING. WERE PEOPLE HAT HAD MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS -- WITH THAT POPULATION FOR UNDOCUMENTED BE THE SAME THAT WOULD BE A LOT OF MENTAL HEALTH FROM. CONDITIONS IN THAT POPULATION. AS A THINK THE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THERE IS CERTAINLY A SEGMENT OF TE UNINSURED UNDOCUMENTED ADULT POPULATION HAS A A REAL NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND IS NOT GETTING THE SERVICES. THANK YOU -- MEN SURE THANK YOU I THINK THE JUST. HAVING -- EXPERIENCES CHAIR OF THE HOSPITAL COMMITTEE IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY -- THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THIS WOULD SAVE MONEY. OF FROM THE MEDICAL SYSTEM PROBABLY -- AND A LOT OF OTHER. SYSTEMS TO AND I'M I'M INCLUDING -- EDUCATION CRIMINAL JUSTICE ALL THE OTHERS SYSTEMS AS WELL AS THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. AND NAM. HAS THERE BEEN ANY RESEARCH QUANTIFYING OLE. THOSE KINDS OF SAVINGS IN THIS IN THIS AREA. I DON'T I DON'T HAVE GOOD NUMBERS ON THAT BUT I AGREE WITH THE CONCEPT THAT YOU KNOW AS ONE EXAMPLE THAT I MENTIONED IMPROVE WORKFORCE PRODUCTIVITY WHEN PEOPLE MISS FEWER DAYS. WHEN PEOPLE HAVE INSURANCE THEY MISS FEWER DAYS OF WORK AND THAT COULD ULTIMATELY HAVE BROADER SAVINGS TO OUR SOCIETY IN? EDUCATION IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE OR OTHER ARE OTHER GOOD EXAMPLES OF THE I THINK IT'S JUST HARD TO TO TO QUANTIFY THOSE IN AND TURN THOSE INTO INTO BUDGET ESTIMATES. ANOTHER ANOTHER FINANCIAL IMPACT THOUGH THAT I DO WANT TO MENTION IS THAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD CERTAINLY REDUCE UNCOMPENSATED CARE COSTS FOR PROVIDERS -- THAT WOULD BE IT ANOTHER RELEVANT. THANK YOU SENATOR OFF. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY QUESTION THAT WE NEED TO TRY. TO COVER MORE FOLKS WITH INSURANCE OF SOME SORT -- ONE OF THE WAYS WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WTH THIS ESCALATING COSTS OF HEALTH CARE. MORE COVERAGE COMMUNITY CLINICS AS OPPOSED TO EMERGENCY ROOMS. BUT IF WE HAVE TO MAKE CHOICES AND OBVIOUSLY CHOICES HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL. TO EXPAND COVERAGE FOR THOSE BETWEEN NINETEEN AND TWENTY SIX YEARS OF AGE -- HAVE YOU ANALYZE THE PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH COVERING THE NINETEEN TO TWENTY SIX YEAR OLDS. AS OPPOSED TO COVERING THOSE WHO WERE SIXTY FIVE OR OLDER OR THOSE WHO WERE SIXTY OR OLDER. SENIORS WHO ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE SERIOUS MEDICAL CONDITIONS TO TODAY IF UNDOCUMENTED ARE NOT COVERED. BY ANYTHING ANYWHERE. WELL I THINK LIKE YOU SAID IT REALLY IT COMES DOWN TO A PUBLIC POLICY DECISION I MEAN BASED ON OUR RESEARCH THERE'S A NEED FOR FOR ALL. FOR INSURANCE ACROSS ALL OF THESE AGE GROUPS -- BUT LIKE YOU SAID AS AS SOME PEOPLE HAVE PROPOSED FOCUSING ON SENIORS BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE THE THE HIGHEST NEED FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND AND OTHERS HAVE A PROPOSED FOCUSING ON YOUNG ADULTS. BECAUSE TODAY THERE ARE TO OUR CHILDREN WHO ARE AGING OUT OF OF MEDI CAL -- AND AN EXPANDING TO YOUNG ADULTS WOULD. PREVENT THAT AT LEAST FROM A FEW YEARS FOR A FEW YEAR THE AFFORDABLE. CARE ACT EXPANSION REQUIRING A PRIVATE INSURERS TO ALLOW YOUNG A YOUNG ADULT DEPENDENCE TO BE ON THEIR PARENTS PLAN TO THEIR TWENTY SIXTH BIRTHDAY. BUT I REALLY I REALLY THINK IT DOES. COME DOWN TO IT A PUBLIC POLICY DECISION IF THE EXPANSION CAN'T OCCUR TO ALL AGE GROUPS THAT ONES IN TERMS OF DECIDING HOW TO PRIORITIZE OTHER BEEN ANY STUDIES DONE ON ON UTILIZATION PROJECTED UTILIZATION RATES. FOR THE NINETEEN TO TWENTY SIX YEARS OF AGE GROUP AS OPPOSED TO THOSE WHO ARE SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER OF THOSE WHO ARE SIXTY AND AND OVER. I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING SPECIFICALLY FOR UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS IN THOSE AGE GROUPS -- I AM SURE THERE CERTAINLY IS A% RESEARCH ON ON DIFFERENCES AND UTILIZATION BY AIDS ACROSS THE BROADER POPULATION BY AGE GROUP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SPOTS AND YOU PRESENTATION THANK YOU VENTURE THANK YOU DR GRANT. THANK YOU IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU YET. AGAIN. HE HAD TO JUST COUPLE DAYS AGO I'M TALKING ABOUT FOR ABILITY -- SO FREE SHE YOUR PRESENTATION -- AYE AYE A THE FIRST OF ALL JUST. TO SUCH A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT -- CENTER ROCK JUST ASKS ND TO TO I GUESS ONE OF THE THINGS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. SORT OF DOING EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX VERSES IN OLDER AGE GROUP -- WE TOUCH ON PREVENTION -- AGAIN I RECOGNIZE THAT THE OLDER AGE GROUP HAS. PERHAPS GREATER IMMEDIATE HEALTH NEEDS ARE NEEDS -- THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY -- FOR PERHAPS MORE PREVENTION WITH SOME THAT YOU'LL RECOGNIZE ALSO THE IDEA IS THE ONE THAT OTHER THINGS WHEN WE ENROLL MORE PEOPLE INTO HEALTH COVERAGE FOR THINGS TO RECOGNIZE IS THAT WHEN SOMEONE HASN'T HAD CONSISTENT HEALTH COVERAGE AND YOU CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. THEY'RE NOT THAT FAMILIAR THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT HEALTH COVERAGE RIGHT. SO THE ACTAL TO LEARN HOW TO USE IT SO WHAT YOU SEE IS WHEN YOU FIRST DO AN EXPANSION YOU'LL SEE SPIKE IN EMERGENCY ROOM USE EVER GOES ALL WAIT A MINUTE I THOUGHT COVERAGE SUPPOSED TO LOWER EMERGENCY ROOM USE WELL IF THAT'S WHAT YOUR NORMAL HABIT IS. YOU DON'T GO THERE WHEN YOU'RE ON INSURED BECAUSE IT'S EXPENSIVE UNLESS YOU REALLY HAVE TO BUT STILL THAT'S THE PLACE TO GO -- AND AND BECAUSE THAT'S MAY BE YOUR ONLY OPTION ARE ONE OF THE FEW OPTIONS -- MAYBE IF YOU'RE FORTUNATE TO HAVE A COMMUNITY CLINIC YOU MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT BUT SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE TO TEACH PEOPLE TO SAY WELL ACTUALLY THAT'S NOT WHERE YOU GO FIRST YOU ACTUALLY HEAR YOU ACTUALLY HAVE OTHER OPTIONS NOW. AND SO -- THAT BIT OF TRANSITION I THINK IT'S SOMETHING SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T RECOGNIZE YOUR ROLLING PEOPLE INTO COVERAGE THAT IS NOT JUST ABOUT -- HERE'S INSURANCE CARD YEARS MEDIC HOW YOU'RE GOOD IT'S LIKE WELL HOW DO YOU USE IT. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN WHAT CAN YOU ACTUALLY ACT YEAH GO OFF AND? THEY'LL GO OFF AND BE HEALTHY SO -- WE DO I THINK THERE'S AN EDUCATION COMPONENT THERE AND I SO WHEN WE SAW THAT HEALTHY FAMILIES AND SO THE HELP EXACTLY WHEN WE GAVE THE CHILDREN COVERAGE BUT NOT THE PARENT RIGHT SO SO I I GO THROUGH THIS I APPRECIATE THAT IT IS JUST. TO IN TERMS OF SETTING EXPECTATIONS ABOUT WHAT WE EXPECT TO HAPPEN. AND SO I THINK THAT SO THERE'S SOME ARGUMENT TO SAY WE HAVE. HOPEFULLY WE HAVE -- KIDS WHO AS THEY GET OLDER YOU CANDEVELOP MORE OF A HABITS A SOCIAL NORM ABOUT COVERAGE THAT WE CAN SUPPORT. MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT ON THE BENEFIT SIDE OF WHY WE POLICY WHY SHE'S ONE OR THE OTHER -- CERTAINLY THE UTILIZED LESS SO WE CAN PROBABLY COVER MORE FOR THE SAME AMOUNT OF DOLLARS AGAIN THERE'S A PUBLIC POLICY CHOICE ABOUT WHERE THE NEED IS AND SO FORTH -- I I DO A TOUCH ABOUT SO AND YOU KNOW WE MENTION THIS IN THE PREVIOUS HEARING A LITTLE BIT BUT IN TERMS OF EXPANDING. YOU KNOW -- THERE PEOPLE ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE I'LL. TO LEARN AND ROLLING AND THEN WE HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED WHO ARE ELIGIBLE BUT WE ALSO KNOW WE A LOT BLENDED FAMILIES RIGHT YEAH. AND SO AND WHAT WE ALSO KNOW FROM PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WITH HEALTH CARE EXPENSES THAT. OFTENTIMES OF ONE FAMILY MEMBER CAN'T GET AT THERE'S LESS INCLINATION FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY TO ENROLL. AND THEN WELL LATER ON TOP OF THAT PUBLIC CHARGE RIGHT SO. SO PUBLIC CHARGES IN JUST ABOUT -- WITH THE UNDOCUMENTED MEMBERS OF THE HOUSEHOLD WANT TO AFRAID TO TAKE PUBLIC SERVICES AT THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD. THEY'RE AFRAID THAT THEY'LL BE LINKED TOGETHER SO REJECTION ON SITE -- PAGE FOR THE SLIDE -- IS. DID YOU BUILD THEN FOR PUBLIC CHARGE IN THIS AT ALL OR NOT SO THIS IS JUST THE BETTER CASE SCENARIO WITHOUT PUBLIC CHART RIGHT THIS IS THE THE BETTER CASE SCENARIO WE DON'T HAVE ANY ANY CHILLING EFFECT FROM PUBLIC CHARTER FROM THE BROADER. IS FEAR THAT'S BEEN YOU KNOW CREATED UNDER THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION -- AND AND SO THIS PICTURE COULD BE WORSE AT THE PUBLIC CHARGE RULES FINALIZED SEPARATELY WE HAVE DONE RESEARCH WITH THE UCLA CENTER FOR HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH. ON HOW MANY CALIFORNIANS MIGHT DESCEND ROLE FOR MEDI CAL AND USING IT IN THAT RESEARCH. WE ESTIMATED THAT I THINK IS AROUND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND FEWER PEOPLE MY AND ROLE IN MEDIC HOW UNDER. THE THE THE WORST CASE THE FEDERAL MEANT SCENARIO THE 35% ISN'T ROMANCE IN THE AREA AND ROLE FOR MEDI CAL WOULD BE. ED CHILDREN MOSTLY CITIZENS CHILDREN IN THESE THAT MAKE STATUS FAMILIES. OKAY. I'D APPRECIATE YOU -- CLARIFYING THAT AND THE OTHER QUESTION I JUST HAD WAS IS THAT -- SO YOU MENTIONED THAT A LOT OF MANY OF THE END DOCUMENT OUT -- ARE ABOUT ALMOST A MILLION ARE RESTRICTED SKILL MEDI CAL BUT I JUST WANT CLEAR FIGHT FOR PEOPLE'S ACCESO PERSONAL -- PEOPLE ON RESTRICTED SKILL MEDI CAL YOU CONSIDERED -- UNINSURED ARE DO YOU COUNT THEM AND THEN SHARED -- IN IN THE IN ALL OF OUR ESTIMATES INCLUDING INCLUDING THE FIGHTING RAGES REFERENCING AS THERE ARE PEOPLE UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS WHO REPORT TO SURVEYS LIKE THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY AND TO THE CENSUS THAT THEY MEDI CAL. AND IN OUR ESTIMATES WE TREAT THEM AS UNANSWERED BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THEIR THEIR ONLY ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE LIMITED SERVICES OKAY IT'S LIKE CLARIFY THAT AND THE OTHER THING IS IS THAT. WHO? SO SO WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT WHAT. A RESTRICTED MEDI CAL IS BECAUSE OF BUT WHO CAN ACTUALLY ACT EVEN ACCESS RESTRICTED MEDI CAL. WHICH WHICH PEOPLE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THOSE -- RESTRICTED SCOPE MEDI CAL AS IS AVAILABLE TO LOW INCOME PEOPLE EARNING LESS THAN A HUNDRED AND WHICH IS ABOUT SIXTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A SINGLE PERSON. TO IT REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS MOST OTHER. THE MOST CITIZENS UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE IN THAT INCOME RANGE ARE ALREADY ELIGIBLE FOR FROM WITH GOT MEDI CAL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RESTRICT IT'S GOT MEDI CAL BEING FOR UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS. OKAY BUT ANYONE OF THAT BELOW THAT AIRING HAZARD AND THE RESTRICTIONS IN TERMS OF SIGNING UP BECAUSE IT IS A AND IS THAT YOU HAVE -- YEAH [inaudible] THE NO DID DID YOU HAVE ONE IN THE OTHER SIDE TO SIDE SO THROUGH JUST TO CLARIFY DOES AND SO THAT AND THAT'S ONLY COURSE ONLY FOR EMERGENCIES. EMERGENCY IN PREGNANCY RELATED SERVICES ALSO USING STATE FUNDS AND RESPECT IT'S GOT MEDI CAL DOES PROVIDE SOME A NURSING HOME SERVICES TO PEOPLE WHO NEED IT AND THERE ARE FEW OTHER AND SMALL EXCEPTIONS LIKE THAT. SO I GUESS I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT -- EVEN THOSE PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT WHETHER THE FIGHT COVERAGE OR NOT CONFERENCE OF COVERAGE OR NOT. I WOULD KEEP IN MIND THAT -- PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE COVERAGE NOT ONLY OF COURSE THEY SUFFERED THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU OUTLINED PRESENTATION WE'RE STILL PAYING FOR THEM [inaudible] HER. OR SO PAINFUL IN SOME WAY WHETHER THROUGH -- YOU KNOW THROUGH RESTRICTED SKILLED MEDI CAL ACTUALLY OR THE OTHER WAY WE ACTUALLY PAID FOR THEM IS IS THAT -- WHEN THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY FOR THE CARE THEY GET THOSE CLASS GETS SPREAD OUT TO EVERYONE ELSE WHO HAS INSURANCE PRIVATE INSURANCE OTHER PEOPLE SO FORTH THOSE COSTS GET SPREAD OUT? SO I THINK THAT IN SOME SURVEYING* WELLS SO WHY SHOULD WE SPEND MONEY ON IS THAT WE KIND OF ALREADY ARE. IT JUST DEPENDS ON WHERE THE MONEY FLOWS BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE WE HOPEFULLY NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. THOSE COSTS DON'T JUST GO AWAY IF WE DON'T PROVIDE COVERAGE THEY FIND A WAY IT GETS UP TO THE GETS COVERED SOME OF THE WAY AND MAYBE LESS AND AND A LESS FUNCTIONAL WHERE IN A WAY THAT MAY NOT NECESSARY TREATMENT CENTER SO THE RIGHT KIND OF CARE. BUT THOSE COST TO MAKE THE WAY AROUND AND THEIR OPINION ON THAT. RATE RATE A AGREE THAT -- WE ARE ALREADY SPENDING ON CARE FOR THIS -- GROUP -- IN AND HOW WORSE WHERE THOSE DOLLARS ARE COMING FOR IT FROM IS QUITE COMPLICATED. AND ALSO THERE'S A LOT OF CARE THAT'S NEEDED THAT THAT'S NOT BEING OBTAINED THEM. BECAUSE OF THE THE ACCESS TO CARE THERE'S A LOT OF UNMET AND RAIL CARE KNEES BUT IN THE END. WHEN THEY FINALLY DO? SIX CHAIR OFTENTIMES LATER AND MORRIS THIS AND MORE EXPENSIVE SETTINGS OTHER TYPES OF THINGS WE ALL DO BEAR THE WE VENTURE. WE'VE ACTUALLY DO THAT THOSE COSTS ARE THERE AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN FIND MORE EFFECTIVE WAYS OF DELIVERING THAT CARE TO PRODUCE BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES. OKAY THANK YOU AGAIN THANK YOU BEGIN MEASURE THANK YOU ONE THING THAT OCCURRED TO ME SENATOR PANEL LISTEN TO YOUR QUESTIONS AS WE TALK AS WE TALK ABOUT A CHILL AFFECT WE WILL HAVE CREATED OUR OWN CHILL AFFECT IF WE'VE COVERED. ON CHILDREN LAST YEAR AND IF THIS ACTION ISN'T TAKEN WILL HAVE A WHOLE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO WILL AGE OUT. OF AT NINETEEN OF COVERAGE BE PROVIDED GO BACK INTO A SITUATION WHERE THEY'RE NOT COVERED SO THAT CREATES A DIFFERENT KIND OF CHILL EFFECT IN TERMS OF A LACK A LACK OF STATE IS DONE IN TERMS OF PROVIDING COVERAGE [inaudible] SENATOR STONE. HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY MADAME CHIANGTO USE THEIR MEMBERS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I I APPRECIATE I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS -- I I DO APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION IT WAS VERY -- IN LIGHTNING -- FIRST A ABOUT THE PUBLIC CHARGE. THAT'S KIND OF A NEW CONCEPT TO ME -- YOU SAID IT'S A POLICY AND IN THE MAKING POTENTIALLY IS THAT SOMETHING THAT -- I ASSUME IT'S HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES -- ADOPTS THEMSELVES OR DOES THIS REQUIRE CODIFICATION BY. CONGRESS AND WE TALK ABOUT THE CHILLING EFFECTS BUT CAN YOU TELL US WHAT THE DIRECT EFFECTS ARE NOT ONLY. TO THE BENEFICIARIES NOT WHAT THEY THINK COULD HAPPEN TO THEM BUT WHAT CAN HAPPEN TO THEM AND DOES THIS PUBLIC. CHARGE HAVE ANY AFFECT ON OUR MEDI CAL WAIVER WHICH IS UP IN TWENTY TWENTY AND WILL IT HURT OUR ABILITY. TO GET TRADITIONAL FUNDS THAT WE NEED TO FIND OUR MEDICAID PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA. THE A THERE IS A LONG STANDING A PUBLIC CHARGE POLICY ALREADY IN PLACE IT WAS ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED IN THE EIGHTEEN EIGHTIES RIGHT AROUND THE SAME TIME AS THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT IF THAT GIVES YOU A SENSE O WHERE IT CAME FROM. TO THE BUT IT ITS RELATIVELY NARROW RIGHT NOW -- IT APPLIES TO PEOPLE WHO ARE APPLYING FOR A GREEN CARD OR VISA AND THE THE PUBLIC PROGRAMS ED THAT COUNTS AGAINST YOU IF YOUR PURSE YOU PARTICIPATE OUR INSTITUTIONAL LONG TERM CARE. AND CERTAIN CASH BENEFITS EARLY PEOPLE WHO ARE APPLYING FOR A GREEN CARD OR VISA ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE SERVICES AND SO THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE OF DIRECTLY AFFECTED UNDER CURRENT POLICY IS IS RELATIVELY LIMITED -- THE IT'S THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY THAT'S PROPOSING THIS CHANGE. THE PROPOSAL CAME OUT IN OCTOBER THE COMMENT PERIOD. CLOSED IN DECEMBER WAITING TO SEE IF THEY ISSUE A FINAL RULE -- IT WOULD NOT REQUIRE A CONGRESS OF THE A AND THE PROPOSED RULE I FOCUSED ON THE PUBLIC PROGRAM ASPECT OF IT FOR THIS PRESENTATION BUT IT WOULD GREATLY EXPANDS THE NUMBER OF THE CRITERIA. THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COULD LOOK AT AND DETERMINING WHETHER SOMEONE GETS A GREEN CARD OR VISA AND IT WOULD COUNT AGAINST SOMEBODY. IF THEY HAVE LOW INCOME IF THEY HAD LINKED LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY A NUMBER OF OTHER FACTORS. IN TERMS OF DETERMINING WHETHER THEY GET THE GREEN CARD SO THERE'S A DIRECT A FACT IN TERMS OF LIMITING IMMIGRATION. BUT THE FACT WE'VE BEEN MOST FOCUS ON IN OUR RESEARCH SOMETIME FOCUS ON HEALTH CARE IS. THE THE BROADER CHILLING EFFECT IT COULD HAVE ON PUBLIC PROGRAMS NOT TESTS MEDI CAL BUT ALSO CAL FRESH FOOD STAMPS AND OTHER PROGRAMS -- AS YOU KNOW -- WE WE DID SESSION WHICH WAS A NECESSITY WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY. AND AS A RESULT MEDI CAL FEES DOCTORS ALBEIT SOME OF BEEN INCREASED -- THE DAILY PART OF YOUR STUDY -- LOOK AT AT THE PRESENT DAY -- ACCESSIBILITY TO OUR EXISTING NETWORK OF PROVIDERS THAT TAKE MEDICARE WHICH IS LIMITED BECAUSE OF THE LOWER FEES. AND WHAT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT WOULD BE -- ADDING THIS POPULATION TO THOSE THOSE ROLES ARE ALREADY STRESSED. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF GOOD RESEARCH ON MEDI CAL AT ACCESS IS NOT MY SPECIFIC AREA OF EXPERTISE IN TERMS OF THE INTERACTIONS WITH THIS POLICY -- AS AS DOCTOR PAN WAS DESCRIBING UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS ARE ALREADY GETTING SOME OF THE CARE THEY NEED IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND I THINK BRINGING THEM INTO. THE HEALTH INSURANCE SYSTEM IN A MORE FORMAL THE PLANNED OUT WAY WOULD HELP. THE STATE PLAN. FOR ITS ITS THE PROVIDER CAPACITY NEEDS AND HELP TO IT THE BETTER ADDRESSED SOME OF THOSE ACCESS ISSUES. AND SO AS A PART OF THE YOU OF QUANTIFIED DO IT WITH THE COSTS ARE GOING TO BE TWO OF IN ROLL pPROGRAM. I BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE COST NEXT OKAY SO -- I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ON THAT AND AND THE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT COULD BE LOST. AS A RESULT OF OF THAT SO -- THANK YOU FOR A STATION. THANK YOU ROSWELL. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION -- NINE AND ALSO APPRECIATE THE CONTEXT THAT YOU GAVE THE STABILITY. OF THE UNDOCUMENTED DOG COMMUNITY THE THEY'RE ALREADY INTEGRATED INTO OUR COMMUNITIES OUR SOCIETY NO MATTER WHERE WERE ALL. WELL IN THE SAME COMMUNITIES -- START A REPRIEVE SHAPE THAT CONTEXT THAT YOU GAVE -- TWO QUESTIONS ONE IS -- I KNOW YOU KIND OF REFERRED TO THIS BUT REALLY WHO ASSUMES. WHERE IS THE RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT BEING? TO GIVE MEDICAL ATTENTION. TO THE SOME. TO THE UNDOCUMENTED -- I MEAN IT'S NOT LIKE. THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THEIR ILLNESS WHAT WHAT REALLY ENDS UP HAPPENING WHERE WHERE DO THEY END UP GOING WHO ASSUMES THE THE RESPONSIBILITY. OF TAKING CARE OF THEM WORK SOME WEIGHT RESPONDING TO THEIR MEDICAL NEEDS. WELL TODAY A LOT OF THE CARE THAT UNDOCUMENTED RESIDENTS GET IS THROUGH PUBLIC HOSPITALS THROUGH A PUBLIC CLINICS THROUGH. A COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS. WHO OFFER CARE TO EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS AND OFTEN DO SO ON A SLIDING SCALE BASIS -- THE SAN CALIFORNIANS DO YOU HAVE ACCESS TO NON EMERGENCY SERVICES -- THROUGH COUNTY PROGRAMS LAKE HEALTHY SAN FRANCISCO AND MY HEALTH LA -- BUT IT'S A DON'T PROVIDE INSURANCE BUT OFFER AND CARE AT GREATLY REDUCE COSTS OF THEM. ED BUT THOSE. NOT EVERY COUNTY HAS A PROGRAM LIKE THAT THOSE ARE ARE SOME OF THE MORE COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAMS AND A LOT OF THE COUNTIES THAT DO OFFER ANY EMERGENT NON EMERGENCY SERVICES. TO UNDOCUMENTED RESIDENTS OFFER LIMITED BENEFITS AND THEN THERE ARE OTHER COUNTIES THAT HAVE ENROLLMENT CAPS FOR THEIR PROGRAMS SO. THERE'S STILL A LOT OF GAPS IN THE SYSTEM AND IT'S AND IT'S NOT CONSISTENT ACROSS THE BOARD SO. RAY IT'S VERY THINKING FRAWLEY'S DIFFERENT FROM THIS COUNTING YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT OKAY -- AND THEN YOU MENTIONED -- ONE OF THE REASONS -- FOR HIGH PERCENTAGE OF THE UNDOCUMENTED NOT HAVING A COVERAGE IS BECAUSE OF NOT HAVING EMPLOYER COVERAGE COMPARED TO THE REST OF ALL OUR COMMUNITIES. IF YOU HAVE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT -- COULD YOU EXPAND -- I'M. FLIPPING TO THE RELEVANT PAGE INNER FOR IT -- SO. FROM THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY -- WE CAN LOOK AT IT NON CITIZENS WITHOUT A GREEN CARD WHICH INCLUDES SOME PEOPLE WITH A VISA -- WHO ARE NOT UNDOCUMENTED BUT IS MOSTLY A GROUP THAT'S UNDOCUMENTED? AND AMONG WORKING AGE ADULTS THE GREEN CARD HAD EMPLOYER SPONSORED INSURANCE IN. TWENTY FOURTEEN AND THAT'S COMPARED 268% OF CITIZENS AND CARD SO SIGNIFICANT LAKE ABOUT A THIRD OF THE RATE OF HAVING EMPLOYER SPONSORED INSURANCE AS CITIZENS. EXPLANATION FOR THAT. THEY WORK IN THE TO OFF IN THE LOW WAGE JOBS INDUSTRIES -- THAT DON'T NECESSARILY PROVIDE HEALTH BENEFITS TO THEIR WORKERS AND THE AS OF THE EMPLOYERS HAVE A ROLE IN A YOU KNOW A REALLY BIG ROLE IN THIS STATE AND OFFERING HEALTH INSURANCE AND STILL HALF OF CALIFORNIANS. GET COVERAGE THROUGH THEIR JOB OR FAMILY MEMBERS JOB -- BUT THE EMPLOYERS THAT'S NOT TRUE FOR THE EMPLOYERS THAT OF A UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS TO THE SAME EXTENT. IF YOU HAVE OTHER CITIES OR IF YOU CAN GET. MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT I WOULD APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THERE ARE MORE LOT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY THING TO YOU SIR. I'M. IN LOOKING AT TODAY'S AGENDA WE DON'T HAVE MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS OR POSITION GROUPS OR HOSPITALS ON THE AGENDA AND I I I I AM WONDERING IF I SHOULD ASSUME THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT. THAT THEY MIGHT BENEFIT FROM. THIS SOURCE OF REVENUE AND THEY'RE JUST GONNA BE REAL HAPPY. BASED ON SOME OF YOUR PRIOR REMARKS AT EIGHTY HERE AT LEAST THERE'S A FUNDING SOURCE NOW. WE HAVE A DOCUMENTED INDIVIDUAL SHOW UP IN OUR EMERGENCY ROOMS IT SAID IT WAS IT WOULD THAT BE A CORRECT ASSUMPTION I CAN'T SPEAK FOR ANY SPECIFIC GROUPS BUT IN GENERAL THE REMAINDER STANDING IS THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND INSURERS ARE ARE SUPPORTIVE BRING EVERYONE INTO THE SYSTEM. THEN -- I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SITTING ON IT COUNTY OPERATED HEALTH SYSTEM. BOARD FOR FOUR YEARS AND I I SEE THAT IT'S AN AMAZING MODEL I I'M WONDERING IN YOUR RESEARCH DID YOU REVIEW THE COUNTY OPERATE HEALTH SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA. A IT HASN'T IT HASN'T BEEN A FOCUS OF MY RESEARCH I THINK I THINK IT IS A REALLY. GOOD QUESTION TO LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE MODELS AND AND WHAT. IMPACT THEY'RE HAVING BUT IT HASN'T BEEN A FOCUS FOR ME. I SAT ON THE CAL OPTIMA BOARD SO. IF YOU WANT TO DO A LITTLE SIDE JOURNEY ON EXPERIENCE -- THE MEMBERSHIP IS IS RATHER DRAMATIC COMPARED YOU KNOW FOR A POPULATION OF THREE MILLION IN OUR COUNTY. THINK WE'RE UP TO ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS IT'S REALLY [inaudible] OF THEN CáC QUITE PHENOMENAL BUT BUT THE ISSUE IS BANNED AS CENTER STONE RAISED IS IS BEEN BINDING. POSITIONS AND HOSPITALS TO TO COOPERATE -- EVEN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE THEIR HOSPITAL WAS NOT BIKE VERY HELPFUL TO CAL OPTIMA. IN SEEING PATIENTS SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU'VE DONE ANY REVIEW RESEARCH AND IN THAT AREA JUST. OKAY WITH HOW DO WE HOW DO WE ACTUALLY. YOU KNOW WHAT ARE. FILL THE VACANCIES YOU KNOW HOW DO WE GET THE DOCTORS BECAUSE AS AS DOCTORS DON'T MENTION THAT THE MEDICAL RATES. WHEN WE HAD THE RECESSION WE HAD TO KEEP CUTTING 10% 10% AND THE AND AND THE DOCTORS ARE JUST SINGLE TIME OUT IF OR NOT GONNA BE COMPENSATED FAIRLY? IN THE YOU'RE LOOKING AT A GROUP THAT I WOULD THINK WOULD NEED. BILINGUAL SKILLS AS WELL. IT OUT AN OLD MULTITUDE OF LANGUAGES AS I'M JUST JUST CURIOUS HOW DO WE MANPOWER THIS WHOLE. PROJECT YEAH WE DEFINITELY HAVE GOT CENTER CAPACITY IMMINENT IF THIS WILL COME UP AND OTHER OTHER. OTHER HEARINGS BUT THERE IS A GREAT REPORT LAST WEEK ON THE FUTURE OF THE HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE THAN WHAT THE STATE NEEDS TO DO -- TO TO BUILD UP THAT CAPACITY -- AND I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU OF IN TERMS OF THE NEED FOR CULTURAL CARE. AT THE THERE'S ALREADY A GREAT NEED FOR THAT AND BASED ON WHO WHO'S ALREADY ELIGIBLE AND THAT WILL GROW EVEN FURTHER -- WITH THIS EXPANSION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. C. APPRECIATED THANK YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU AND WE HAVE. RECENT BUDGET HISTORY -- SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT PROP FIFTY SIX AND ACKNOWLEDGING THAT REALITY IN TERMS TO PROVIDE A SHORTAGE AND HAVE. HAVE DONE OUR DUE DILIGENCE -- IN IN IN THE IN THE GOOD TIMES OF OF BUDGET RECENT HISTORY IN TERMS OF ACKNOWLEDGING THAT AND DO WHAT WE CAN TO INCREMENTALLY IMPROVE -- REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND YOU KNOW PERHAPS EXPANDING THE MEDI CAL POOL WOULD ATTRACT MORE PROVIDERS BACK INTO THE SYSTEM -- I THINK THAT'S ONE WAY OF LOOKING AT IT AS WELL. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS -- BEFORE WE MOVE ON OUR AGENDA. TO THE NEXT PANEL. SEEN ON THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. FOR JUMP STARTING THIS -- VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. I'M SORRY I HAD ONE QUESTION I MISS MY OWN NOTE. EVERYONE ELSE COME ON THE NEXT PANEL COME JOIN. AND I HAD IT IN MY HAND LOOKING AT IT GEE WHIZ PAGE NINE OF YOUR SLIDE AND YOU MAY HAVE SAID YOU PRESENTATION I MISSED IT. WHERE YOU SHOW CURRENT ENROLLED IN RESTRICTED MEDI CAL? AN ELIGIBLE BUT NOT ROLL THE STONE ONLY 80% BUT TO IT BOUT TWENTY TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE. ANY SENSEOF WHY THEY AREN'T ENROLLED. WELL AS THAT ENROLLMENT RAY IS NOT TOO DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE SEE FROM THE OVER ALL OF THE BUTTON MEDI CAL POPULATION GOT IT. TO OVERALL WE ESTIMATE THAT MORE THAN 90% OF THOSE CITIZENS UNLAWFULLY PRESENT IMMIGRANTS WERE ELIGIBLE TO ENROLL BENEFITS -- ARE ENROLLED IN. THE AND PEOPLE CAN ENROLL IN RESTRICTED SCOTT MEDI CAL NOT ONLY. IS SOME PEOPLE ENROLL WHEN THEY ACTUALLY NEED CARE LIKE IN THE A ARSENIC BUT OTHER PEOPLE. MAY ENROLL FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THERE'S THE ENROLLING THEIR WHOLE FAMILY AND MEDICAL BECAUSE THEY HAVE CITIZEN CHILDREN WHO ARE ELIGIBLE AND THEY GET ENROLLED AT THE THING I DIDN'T KNOW IF WE HAD THE ANSWERS TO THAT QUESTION AS WE AS WE DEAL WITH THE PUBLIC CHARGE. YOU KNOW FLOW RAMP UP MIX HOUSEHOLD STATUS ALL THESE ISSUES THAT WILL COMPLICATE OUR ABILITY TO ENROLL PEOPLE ARE MOSTLY PROVIDE FULL COVERAGE SO I THAT WE MIGHT HAVE SOME INSIGHT THERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. COLLEAGUES WERE GOING TO MOVE NOW INTO OUR SECOND PANEL THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED EXPANSION OF FULL SCOPE MEDI CAL COVERAGE I THINK THIS IS THE GROUP THAT WILL ANSWER SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS THAT YOU WERE -- POLICY -- SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARD TO WHY THE THIS WAY. FIRST WE'LL HEAR FROM MISS CAN'T WELL HELLO HIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES SHOULD BE FOLLOWED BY AN TO CHING'S SECTION CHIEF ADULT PROGRAMS ESTIMATE AND AUTOMATION FROM DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. LARA YELLOW STAFF FINANCE BUDGET ANALYST FROM THE PART IN FINANCE AND SYDNEY. TANIMOTO STAFF FINANCE A BUDGET ANALYST IN THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. HELLO EVERYBODY HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY. I'M NOT WEARING RED BUT JENNIFER IS SOCIAL SHE'LL BE THE REPRESENTATIVE IN DCS THAT'S ACTUALLY. MORE OF A FESTIVE. ANYWAY -- SO THINGS ARE HAVING US TODAY SO JUST BRIEFLY I'LL GO OVER WHAT THE PROPOSAL IS AN ARE FISCAL ESTIMATE AND I KNOW AS YOU MENTIONED YOU HAVE OTHERS HERE WHO WILL SPEAK TO THEIR PIECES. SO THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING THAT WE EXPAND -- FULL SCOPE MEDI CAL TO THOSE WHO ARE AGE ãETEEN UP OF TWENTY SIX WE ARE ANTICIPATING ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WILL NOW IT WOULD BE GETTING FULL SCOPE COVERAGE AT THE END OF THE FIRST YEAR OF THIS EXPANSION -- ABOUT EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND OF THOSE ARE INDIVIDUALS ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN THE LIMITED SCOPE COVERAGE -- OUR NUMBERS ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE PREVIOUS PANELIST IN TERMS OF SORT OF THE TOTAL POPULATION NUMBERS BUT PRETTY CLOSE PROBABLY JUST DIFFERENT POINT IN TIME ESTIMATES -- IN TERMS OF THE FISCAL ESTIMATE WE EIGHT MILLION TOTAL FINES -- FOR A FULL FIRST YEAR OF OF THE END OF THE PROGRAM A HUNDRED NINETY FOUR MILLION OF THAT IS GENERAL FUND -- KEEPING IN MIND AGAIN THAT WE CURRENTLY SPEND MONEY ON THE RESTRICTED SCOPE SO WE'VE OFFSET THAT -- TO TO GET TO SERVE THAT NET INCREASE GENERAL FUND A HUNDRED NINETY FOUR MILLION. I'M OBVIOUSLY THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED THAT THIS BE AFFECTED NO SOONER THAN JULY FIRST I THINK ALL OF YOU ARE AWARE THAT -- OUR SYSTEMS DON'T TURN ON A DIME. WHO -- WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON WHAT THE YOU KNOW UP. ACTUAL TIMELINE WILL LOOK LIKE WE'RE CERTAINLY MOVING FORWARD NOW WITH THOSE NECESSARY CHANGES -- UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT SOMETHING OF THIS NATURE WILL HAPPEN SO THAT WE CAN DO IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. BUT IT'S DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO BE JULY FIRST SO JUST. TO PUT OF A YOU KNOW I THINK YOU ALL KNEW THAT BUT LET'S JUST BE BE. STRAIGHTFORWARD -- BUT WHILE WERE WORKING ON THE SYSTEM PIECE AND AGAIN THAT'S YOU KNOW EFFORT FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT PIECE -- IN TERMS OF CHANGING ELIGIBILITY DEVELOPMENT OF THE ELIGIBILITY ENROLLMENT PLAN WE DID THIS FOR SB SEVENTY FIVE AND TO THIS WILL INFORM FOLKS OF THE STEPS THAT WERE TAKING AND REALLY BE ABLE TO GET. INPUT ON WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO OUT REACH TO FOLKS SO THAT THEY'RE AWARE OF OF THIS POSSIBILITY WILL ALSO BE -- DEVELOPING BENEFICIARY NOTICES AGAIN THIS IS VERY TYPICAL FOR US AND WHAT WE DID IN SB. SEVENTY FIVE REALLY TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THEY ELIGIBLE FOR IF THEY'RE SWITCHING FROM RESTRICTED SCOPE TO FULL SCOPE -- THEIR HEALTH PLAN ENROLLMENT INFORMATION AND HOW TO ACCESS THAT AND SO WILL BE WORKING OBVIOUSLY WITH OUR CONSUMER FOCUSED STAKEHOLDER GROUP THAT WE HAVE EVERY MONTH. AS WELL AS OUR COUNTY PARTNERS IN THE ELIGIBILITY OFFICES AND SEE W. D. A TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE NOTICES ARE CLEAR AND THAT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE INFORMATION THAT'S BEING PRESENTED TO THEM. SO THAT'S REALLY THE HIGH LEVEL OF THE PROPOSAL ALL CERTAINLY -- TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SOCIAL SERVICES -- THANK YOU SIR. RIGHT FOR SOCIAL. FOR FOR SOCIAL SERVICES THREE ASSUMING ABOUT TWO POINT TWO MILLION. DOLLARS IMPLEMENTATION OF OFF THE UNDOCUMENTED. ARE WE DO HAVE A THREE MONTH LAG AFTER THE USE YES IMPLEMENTATION FOR RESTRICTED SCOPE AND SIX POINT PLAN. FOR THE AND ELIGIBLE BUT NOT RULES KEYSTONE. SO WE'RE ASSUMING THAT -- IN NINETEEN TWENTY ONLY ROUGHLY AROUND FIFTY SIX CASELOAD THAT WERE. GOING TO HAVE A JUSTICE US RISK I JUST AS RECIPIENT. THANK YOU NGUYEN WHOLE QUESTION TO THE IN COLLEAGUES. NEXT WITNESS. LARA YEAH LE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- WAS FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND ARE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. HEARD. AND FOR A AND WHENEVER YOU'RE FROM SYDNEY. SORRY JAKE A POOR WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INANCE SYDNEY ACTUALLY COULDN'T MAKE IT TODAY GOT IT OR REPLACE ALL RIGHT GREAT. WE WELCOME YOU JACOB DANCE MEGLIO. A HIGH BEN JOHNSON LA -- HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY AND THE VALENTINE'S DAY -- SO YESTERDAY WE RELEASE GOVERNOR'S MEDI CAL BUDGET AND THIS DOES INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSED INCREASE IN -- MEDI CAL EXPAND -- ELIGIBILITY FOR THIS POPULATION -- I I WOULD NOTE THAT ULTIMATELY -- UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THE NET COST OF THE EXPANSION IS A IS CURRENTLY PROJECTED TO BE A LITTLE LOWER GIVEN SOME SAVINGS ON THE WAS ESSENTIALLY A REDIRECTION OF FUNDING THAT CURRENTLY GOES TO COUNTY HEALTH ACTIVITIES -- TO ULTIMATELY OFFSET GENERAL FUND COSTING QUE IN CALORIES AND SO THAT WOULD LOWER THE NET GENERAL FUND -- ESTIMATE FOR THIS PROPOSAL TO A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS -- WE WE WE CREATED OUR SORT OF OWN SORT OF PROJECTIONS AND TRIED TO TIE THEM AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE -- TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S ASSUMPTIONS AND WHILE THE THE COST IN THE IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY WOULD BE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR MILLION WHICH WE DO AND OUR PROJECTIONS WHICH SHOW THAT IT WOULD GROW. TO HOLD POTENTIALLY ABOUT A LITTLE LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS NET GENERAL FUND IN THE OUT YEARS AS NEW ELIGIBLE BUT NOT ROLLED INDIVIDUALS COME ON TO THE PROGRAM AND AS I JUST AS COSTS. POTENTIALLY RAMP UP INTO THE OUT YEARS YOUR FINDINGS -- FIRST -- WE GRAPPLE WITH SOME OF THE SAME ISSUES AS SENATOR ROTH IN OUR ANALYSIS OF THIS PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO DECIDE AMONG ITS PRIORITIES IN TERMS OF DO WE DO WE EXPAND COVERAGE TO THE NINETEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD POPULATION THERE BY. YOU KNOW EXTENDING CONTINUOUS COVERAGE ALL THE WAY FROM -- ZERO TO TWENTY FIVE AND MAKE IT CONSISTENT WITH THE ACA. VERSES YOU KNOW OTHER CONSIDERATIONS SUCH AS ELDERLY POPULATION HAVING HIGHER HEALTH NEEDS AND HAVING HEALTH NEEDS THAT MIGHT NOT. AS OFTEN BE COVERED BY EMERGENCY IN RESTRICTED SAID PREGNANCY RELATED SERVICES SUCH AS FOR THE YOUNG ADULT POPULATION. WE DON'T HAVE A RECOMMENDATION THERE BUT JUST A A BRACE SOME OF THOSE ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION -- SECOND WE DO FIND THAT THE INCREMENTAL COST OF INCREASING THE SIX PAGER COULD BE SOMEWHAT OVERSTATED ONE FOR THE SAME REASON -- THAT -- MISS CAN'T WELL TO THE IMPLEMENTATION DATE PROBABLY NOT OCCURRING RIGHT ON JULY FIRST -- AND THEN THE SECOND IS WHAT WE FIND TO BE IN A RONI IS ASSUMPTION RELATED TO CASELOAD WHICH MAY MAKE THAT MAY MAKE THE CASE LOW'S SOMEWHAT OVERSTATED -- NOT JUST IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BUT GOING FORWARD -- IN OUR VIEW CORRECTING THIS ASSUMPTION -- THIS ARONIE IS AS I'M SURE WE THINK WOULD WOULD LOWER COSTS BY ABOUT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY -- WE ALSO DO RAISE SOME ISSUES ON THE ON THE PROPOSED RE DIRECTION ON OF REALIGNMENT WE'RE CONTINUING TO ASSESS THAT AN ALTERNATE WE WILL RELEASE A FUTURE -- ANALYSIS OF THAT -- BUT WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT SOME INCREASE IN THE REDIRECTION OF REALIGNMENT FUNDING IS LIKELY APPROPRIATE GIVEN THAT COUNTY COSTS HAVE GONE DOWN BOTH AS RESULT OF THE ACA. AS A RESULT OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE INTERVENING YEARS WITH THE EXPANSION OF CHILDREN'S COVERAGE SO UNDER ANY UNDER -- AN EXTRA A FURTHER EXPANSION -- AND WE'D ALSO NOTE THERE AND JUSTIFICATION THAT -- CERTAIN COUNTIES THAT -- WORK TOGETHER TO PROVIDE COVERAGE UNDER THAT COUNTY SERVICES -- MEDICAL PROGRAM. THAT THEY HAD THEY'VE BUILT UP A LARGE RESERVE AND I THINK THE THE PROPOSED REDIRECTION IS ATTEMPTING TO SORT OF MAKE FUNDING A LITTLE BIT MORE IN LINE. WITH THAT WITH WHAT THEIR EXISTING BUDGET IS -- BUT WE DO RIGHT WE WE WOULD RAISE. QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SCOPE AND MAGNITUDE OF THAT -- PROPOSED INCREASE IN THE REALIGNMENT RE DIRECTION -- FINDING THAT IT COULD HAVE IMPACTS ON LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES -- AND IT THAT IT IT COULD CALL FEATURE VIABILITY -- THE SERVICES FOR GIVEN THAT IT IT PROBABLY WOULD NOT RECEIVE ANY FUNDING WHATSOEVER AND REALIGNMENT -- FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE SO HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. UP I'M GONNA START IF YOU DON'T MIND CALLING THE DISK A HAVE A THE TEN THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL QUESTION YOU KNOW WE WE DID CHILDREN LAST YEAR NO WARNING. EITHER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OR FINANCES THERE'S ANY THOUGHT GIVEN IS THIS KIND OF AN INCREMENTAL APPROACH SO WE DID KIDS ARE WE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW THIS. THE NEXT SEVEN YEAR GAP. BECAUSE I'M RECOGNIZING HOW COMPLEX THIS IS. IT WE'RE GOING TO REALIGN REALIGNMENT. RECOGNIZING THE TIME AND AND EFFORT AND COST IT TAKES TO UPDATE SYSTEMS TO GET READY -- YOU KNOW. DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO PERHAPS DUE A YEAR PLANNING WHATEVER AND TALK ABOUT BRINGING THE ENTIRE UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT. INTO THE MEDI CAL SYSTEM. AS OPPOSED TO THE IF. EVERY YEAR SEVEN YEAR GROUP. THIS PIECEMEAL APPROACH THANK YOU SENATOR SONG [inaudible] IT. LAURIE LA THE BERMAN FINANCE SO. TO ANSWER HE FIRST PART OF THE QUESTION REGARDING -- IF THIS IS JUST AN INCREMENTAL APPROACH GOVERNOR HAS STATED% THAT THE GOAL IS FOR EVERYBODY TO HAVE COVERAGE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND HE DID STATE -- DAD THIS IS A FIRST STEP OF THIS IS A DOWN PAYMENT -- WITH. BRAD BUT CURRENTLY IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE PROPOSAL IS TO BUILD ON SB THIRTY FIVE EXPANSION AND CONTINUE COVERAGE THROUGH THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE TO YOUR SECOND POINT I THINK THAT IS. DISCUSS THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS ON EXPAND YOU KNOW LEGISLATORS PRIORITIES AND POTENTIAL EXPANSION TO THE FULL POPULATION AND WHAT THE COSTS OF THAT WOULD BE. BECAUSE I MEAN JUST PRACTICALLY THINKING IN TERMS OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH IT INCREMENTAL APPROACH TO UPDATING SYSTEMS BUT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREMENTAL APPROACH TO EDUCATING THE GENERAL PUBLIC ABOUT WHO'S COVERED THIS YEAR WHO'S GONNA BE COVERED NEXT YEAR WHO'S GONNA BE COVERED IN YOUR FIVE OR SIX WE HEAR. THE ISSUES AROUND THE CHILLING EFFECT OF PUBLIC CHARGES SO MANY -- CHALLENGES TO ROLLING OUT EXPANSION OF SERVICES WITH EXPERIENCE AT HISTORICALLY HEALTHY FAMILIES IT TOOK US. YOU KNOW FIVE TIMES AS LONG AS WE THOUGHT IT WOULD IN TERMS OF INTRODUCING TO A NEW POPULATION A NEW HEALTH PRODUCTS. AND SO I HOPE THAT WE WILL LEARN FROM OUR PAST EXPERIENCES AND BENEFIT FROM THEM THEY REALLY THINK ABOUT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE -- TO DO IT AT LEAST IN A BIGGER SWAPPED IN SEVEN YEAR INCREMENTS SINCE THE NINETEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD WHO'LL COME NEXT -- AND I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND FLIP IT IT REALLY IS A A QUESTION ABOUT [inaudible] STRATEGICALLY APPROACHING THIS EXPANSION. SURE SO JUST TO ADD ON TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM DEPARTMENT OFFINANCE SAID I MEAN CERTAINLY THERE ARE. YOU KNOW WOULD BE ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCIES DOING IF WE WERE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO THIS TO DO THIS AT THE SAME TIME I WOULD JUST POINT OUT AND I THINK WE SHARE THESE COSTS WITH YOUR STAFF AND CERTAINLY WITH THE LA SO. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THOSE ADDITIONAL POPULATIONS THE DOLLARS WERE TALKING ABOUT GET PRETTY SIGNIFICANT ABOUT TEN TIMES LARGER THAN THE NUMBER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE? THAT WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT LIKE ONE POINT. SIX ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS GIVE OR TAKE JUST IN THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM THAT DOES NOT REFLECT THE COSTS -- OF ADDITIONAL HSS ON THE CELLS ARE SIR THAT SORT OF IN THE OFFICE THE ARE. WE ARE NOT ALWAYS SUPER EFFICIENT AND THE COST OF ADMINISTRATION BUT WE'RE NOT WE DON'T COST ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION TO CHANGE THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. I GET THAT BUT BUT BUT BUT WE BUT WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THIS MORNING IS RECOGNIZING WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION IS CURRENTLY RECEIVE A RESTRICTED MEDI CAL. THE I JUST THIS PIECE WOULD BE BIGGER BECAUSE THE OLDER POPULATION THEIR NEEDS ARE. BROADER AND IT'S BEYOND THE SCOPE OF RESTRICTED MEDI CAL SO I GET THAT. THE ONLY -- HAVE ANY COMMENT ON MY RANT -- WELL I MERRY REALLY COVER MISS CAN'T WILL REALLY COVER DOWN -- MOST WAS GONNA SAY THE ADMINISTRATION DID RELEASE ESTIMATES WHEN WE PUT IT TOGETHER SO -- ULTIMATELY THIS PROPOSAL WOULD TOUCH MAYBE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND OF UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATES. ONE POINT TWO BILLION -- ART MILLION EXCUSE ME PEOPLE WHO COULD GAIN -- COVERAGE UNDER AN EXPANSION -- TO AND WE FIND THAT THIS WOULD AND OR AT LEAST THE ADMINISTRATION FINDS AND IN US AND TRYING TO ADD ASSOCIATE COSTS WITH AYE TO ASSESS AND SO FORTH. THIS WOULD RAISE STATE COSTUME FOR A BY OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND THIS INCLUDES EXISTING SPENDING AND THAT THAT'S THE INCREMENTAL COST ABOVE WHAT WE SPEND ON RESTRICTED SCOPE SERVICES -- FOR FOR MUCH OF THIS ONE POINT TWO POPULAR -- ONE POINT TWO MILLION POPULATION -- A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF WHOM ARE ENROLLED IN CURRENTLY IN RESTRICTED SCOPE. AND I'LL MAKE ONE LAST -- POINT THEN I'LL MOVE ON TO SENATOR ROD -- FIVE CERTAINLY -- I'D FIVE VOTED IN SUPPORT OF THE EXPANSION LAST YEAR AND WILL WE SUPPORT EXPANSION. TO UP TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLDS I JUST KNOW WE'RE GONNA SPEND A% LOT OF TIME AND ENERGY RESOURCES -- TALK ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WHEN THERE IS A BROADER POPULATION -- THAT IF PHILOSOPHICALLY WE ARE GONNA MAKE A POLICY DECISION TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO CARE TO THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE. BUT FOR THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS THIS INCREMENTAL APPROACH IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT OF TIME ENERGY. FORCE TO DO THAT WE SHOULD HAVE THE BROADER CONVERSATION SENATOR ROBB. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- I HAVE TWO AREAS AND LIKE TO ASK ABOUT ONE HAS TO DO WITH THE THE PUBLIC POLICY ISSUE UNFORTUNATELY OF RACES EVEN THOUGH. MOST OF US I THINK CERTAINLY I'M ONE OF THOSE WOULD LIKE TO COVER EVERYONE. AS A AS A MECHANISM OF TRYING TO DRIVE DOWN THE OVERALL COST OF HEALTH CARE IN THE END CERTAINLY IN CALIFORNIA IF NOT THE UNITED STATES. BUT WE CAN'T DO THAT. SO THE PUBLIC POLICY DECISION TO COVER THOSE NINETEEN TO TWENTY SIX AS OPPOSED. TO COVERING THOSE. SIXTY FIVE AND OVER ARE THOSE SIXTY YEAR OVERI'M LOOKING IN OUR ANALYSIS AND IT LOOKS TO ME THAT THE OVERALL COST OF THE NINETEEN TO TWENTY SIX IS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN MILLION. LESS THE BEFORE YOU TAKE OFF THE FEDERAL [inaudible] SHARE VIA. AND THE COST OF COVERING THE SENIORS IS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION. BEFORE YOU TAKE OFF THE A FEDERAL SURE FOR THE EMERGENCY CARE. IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT IN LOOKING AT FURTHER EIGHTEEN ALICE'S IF WE IN FACT HAVE FORTY SEVEN COUNTIES THAT ARE PROVIDING SOME. ELEMENT. OF SAFETY NET SERVICES NOT EMERGENCY CARE TO THE UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION -- AND GIVENWHAT I ANTICIPATE THE UTILIZATION RATE OF THE NINETEEN TO TWENTY SECURE ROLES TO BE. THAT WOULD MITIGATE TOWARD COVERING. THE SENIOR POPULATION IF WE HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE. COULD SOMEBODY AND I UNDERSTAND CONTINUITY OF CARE AND AND DUCT PAN A PREVENTIVE MEDICINE AND ALL THAT BUT COULD SOMEONE. TALK TO ME ABOUT THE POLICY DECISION. THAT WAS MADE. SO I JUST WANT AT ONE ONE NOTES THOSE COSTS ARE OUR DH CS COSTS IN THE IN THE MEDI CAL ESTIMATE WHAT'S NOT REFLECTED THERE ARE THE COSTS OF AYE AGES STATUS. SO I DON'T I I WOULD DEFER TO MY SOCIAL ERVICES COLLEAGUES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE CORRECT TOTAL FAR TOTAL NUMBERS BECAUSE THE TWO FIFTY SEVEN AND AND ONE FIFTEEN ARE ACCURATE-FROM. THE DTS SIDE BUT I JUST AS COST OBVIOUSLY WOULD BEVERY DIFFERENT SO I JUST I DIDN'T WANNA HAVE A MISUNDERSTANDING OF WHICH POPULATION MIGHT BE CHEAPER I THINK WHEN YOU ADD IN I JUST AS IT. CHECK IT CHANGES THE TOTALS LET'S ASSUME IT'S EQUAL. THAT'S A SUMA LET'S ASSUME A DOUBLING OF THE COST FOR THE SENIOR POPULATION. TO GET IT TO TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY OR TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN ONE ADDRESS THE POLICY ISSUE AND THE DECISION THAT WAS MADE TO COVER THE NINETEEN TO TWENTY SIX YEAR OLDS AS OPPOSED TO THE SENIOR POPULATION ANDPROBABLY HAS A HIGHER UTILIZATION RATE WITH MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT. ARE MUCH. A MORE SERIOUS THAN THE INVINCIBLE POPULATION. THANKS. DIFFERENT FINANCE THAT I THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE -- NOTE I THINK THAT A WELL TAKEN. I WOULD SAY THAT THE THAT THE POLICY DECISION WAS TO BUILD ON THE PREVIOUS EXPANSION LIKE HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN STATED. TO BUILD ON THE EXPANSION OF THE SB SEVENTY FIVE SO CURRENTLY -- INDIVIDUALS ARE COVERED THROUGH THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN SO THAN THIS WHAT A CONTINUE THROUGH THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE THAT'S THE THE GOVERNOR'S -- BUDGET THAT'S WHAT INCLUDES THROUGH TWENTY FIVE WE'RE HAPPY TO DISCUSS ANY -- THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES WELL AND BELIEVE ME I'M NOT BEING CRITICAL OF THE ADMINISTRATION I APPLAUD ANY EFFORT TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF COVERED -- INSURED INDIVIDUALS IN THE STATE OFCALIFORNIA AMONG THE UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION SO KUDOS. TO TO YOU AND TO THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THAT WILL LET ME MOVE ON TO MY SECOND AREA. AND THAT'S THIS NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT IN THE CALL BACK. COULD SOMEONE GOING TO OF THIS IS A AN ISSUE THAT I'M INTERESTED IN AND I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE TO MY RIGHT FROM RIVERSIDE COUNTY IS ALSO INTERESTED AND SO COULD SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME THE CLUB THAT PROCESS AND HOW THE AMOUNTS WILL BE. COMPUTED FOR THE CALL BACK. AND LET'S ASSUME WE'RE NOT ONE OF THE C.. WHAT WE CALL? THE SIXTY FORTY SEVENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE COUNTIES. PLUS PLUS WHATEVER SO ALL -- WALK THROUGH JUST THE DIFFERENT CALCULATIONS THAT HAPPEN AND THEN CERTAINLY MY DEPARTMENT FINANCE COLLEAGUES CAN TALK ABOUT THE PROPOSAL THAT'S CHANGING WHAT WE PUT IN PLACE WITH THE EXPANSION IN. TWENTY FOURTEEN SO WHAT WE REFER TO AS AB -- EIGHTY FIVE WAS THE INITIAL -- DETERMINATION OF HOW MUCH MONEY WE WERE EXCHANGE WITH YOU KNOW WITH THE COUNTIES TO PAY FOR CAL WORKS BECAUSE OF THAT BROUGHT EXPANSION THAT HAPPENED IN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WITH THE ACA -- THE WAY WE ENDED UP DOING THAT IN THE LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED IS THAT COUNTIES WERE BROKEN INTO THREE GROUPS. WE HAD THE CMS P. COUNTIES WHICH WERE JUST THE STREET SIXTY FORTY IN THE INITIAL AB EIGHTY FIVE WE HAD OUR PUBLIC HOSPITAL COUNTIES -- WHICH WE CALL DOES NEED A PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS THE PEACHES. LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS -- AND THEN WE HAD THE REST OF THE COUNTIES THAT ARE THAT DON'T HAVE YOU MAJOR PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS WE CALL THEM ARTICLE THIRTEEN IS JUST BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT IS IN THE STATUTE. WE WE DON'T HAVE FANCY NAMES FOR ANYTHING. SO -- SO FOR THE FOR THE NON CMS P.TOWNIES BOTH THE PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS AND THE NON PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEM COUNTIES THEY HAD A CHOICE. AS TO WHETHER THEY JUST WERE DOING THE SIXTY FORTY SO REDIRECTING 60% OF THE REALIGNMENT TO FIND CAL WORKS OR IF THEY WANTED. TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FORMULA METHOD WHICH IT'S COMPLICATED BUT THE IDEA THEY'RE BEING THAT WE WOULD CALCULATE WHAT WE WOULD EXPECT COUNTIES HAVE OTHERWISE SPENDS. IN REALIGNMENTS AND ALL THE FUNDING THAT WE THEY GETFROM MEDI CAL IN OUR IN OUR WEAVERS. AND COMPARE THAT TO THEIR COSTS THEY WERE SAVING MONEY WE WOULD RE DIRECT 80% OF THAT SAVING SO IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED FORMULA THAT WE DO. EVERY YEAR -- AND ALL OF OUR PUBLIC HOSPITAL COUNTIES HAVE CHOSEN THAT METHODOLOGY AND THEN I BELIEVE FIVE OF OUR I THINK FIVE OTHER COUNTIES CHOSE THE FORMULA SO -- THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE RE DIRECTION COMES FROM THE FORMULA BASED COUNTIES -- WITH THE SMALLER DOLLARS COMING FROM CMS P. AND THE OTHER SIXTY FORTY COUNTIES AND THE CHANGES THAT THAT. MISSILE WILL GO OVER -- ARE REALLY TODAY. THAT NON FORMULA THE FORMULA ISN'T CHANGING IT'S REALLY THE ONES WHERE IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT BASED ON COST AND REVENUE IT'S JUST BASED ON A SPLIT PERCENTAGE OF THE REALIGNMENT. RYAN MILLER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND SO -- I GUESS TO GET AT THE THE CHOICE THAT WE MADE ABOUT ABOUT WHAT LEVEL TO REDIRECT -- AS AS MS CAM WELL AT NOTED EARLIER THE GENERAL FUND COSTS OF THIS EXPANSION ARE ESTIMATED AT ONE HUNDRED NINETY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS -- COUNTIES ARE CURRENTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING HEALTH CARE TO ENGINE -- POPULATIONS AND SO -- WE LOOK TO ADD WHAT SORT OF ESTIMATE -- WE WOULD HAVE ON ON WHAT SORT OF SAVINGS THAT THEY WOULD EXPERIENCE -- THE SIXTY THREE MILLION REPRESENTS LESS THAN A THIRD OF THAT TOTAL. IT SEEM REASONABLE TO US WE'RE TALKING WITH COUNTY IS TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS BUT WHEN I THINK YOU THINK ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF IT BEING LESS THAN A THIRD OF THE TOTAL GENERAL FUND COST. WE A WE THOUGHT THAT WAS A REASONABLE ASSUMPTION IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT AND BELIEVE ME I AM. NOT AN EXPERT ON THIS SO I AND I HAVE THICK SKIN SO I WOULD EXPECT YOU TO CORRECT ME IF MY UNDERSTANDING IS INCORRECT. BUT THE FUNDING FORMULA THAT WAS ARRIVED AT AN NEGOTIATED FRANKLY BY THE COUNTIES IN THE ADMINISTRATION AT THE TIME IN. NINETEEN NINETY ONE WAS BASED ON KELLY POPULATIONS AT THE TIME CASELOADS AND THERE WAS SOME OTHER FACTOR THAT I'M CONFESS I DON'T REMEMBER. IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE RIVERSIDE COUNTY'S POPULATION WAS A MILLION OR LESS. TODAY IT'S ABOUT TO ALMOST TWO POINT FIVE MILLION IN THE CASE LOADS OF INCREASED. TO IN A IN A COMMENSURATE WAY. THE FUNDING FORMULA THE BASIC FORMULA MY UNDERSTANDING FURTHER UNDERSTANDING IS HAS NOT BEEN ADJUSTED SINCE. NINETEEN NINETY ONE THAT THERE WAS SOME GROWTH FACTOR IN THE NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT FLOW TO THE COUNTIES. AND THERE WAS OF OF THE WAY TOO FOR DIRECT. A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THE GROWTH FACTOR. TO THE UNDER FUNDED COUNTIES AND THAT'S BEEN GOING ON BUT THAT'S BEEN A RATHER SMALL. INCREMENTAL INCREASE IN THE FLOW OF MONEY THROUGH THE PIPELINE AND OF COURSE WHEN WE HAD THE HSS SITUATION A FEW YEARS AGO WAS CHEWED UP -- AND USED. APPROPRIATELY FOR NECESSARY SERVICES FOR THE H. ASSIST SERVICES. SO BOTTOM LINE IS WE HAVE UNDERFUNDED COUNTIES WHO AND WHAT I'M HUGE FUNDING DISPARITY IN THE STATE. THE URBAN COASTAL AREAS VERSUS THE INLAND AREAS NORTH CENTRAL AND IN ONE SOUTH. SO IF YOU'RE CALLING BACK MONEY YOU'RE CLAWING BACK MONEY IN SOME CASES AT THE UNDER FUNDED COUNTY LEVEL. FROM COUNTIES WHO DON'T HAVE VERY MUCH MONEY TO BEGIN WITH TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. SO MY REQUEST IS THIS MILLION CONTEMPLATING THIS POLICY -- THAT YOU THINK ABOUT WHETHER YOU CAN ADJUST THE CALLBACK. TO IN EFFECT -- DO WHAT. POLITICALLY MIGHT BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DO IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL FORMULA BUT IT JUST. OF THE MONEY THAT COUNTIES PARTICULAR THESE UNDERFUNDED COUNTIES HAVE. TO PROVIDE BADLY NEEDED HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES INSTEAD OF APPLYING A ONE SIZE FITS ALL CALL BACK. TO THE APPROPRIATELY FUNDED COUNTIES IN THOSE THAT SOME OF US WOULD ARGUE. ARE SERIOUSLY UNDERFUNDED DOES THAT MAKE SENSE. SO I JUST WANTED TO SO I WOULD I WOULD JUST POINT OUT IN TERMS OF THE WAY IT WORKS TODAY -- SINCE RIVERSIDE COUNTY IS THE ONE THAT'S BEING MENTIONED THEY ARE ONE OF THE FORMULA COUNTIES. SO IT'S ESSENTIALLY IT'S BY WHILE THEY PROBABLY DIDN'T A WAS A LOOK A LOOK AT THE REVENUES THEY WERE GETTING INCLUDING REALIGNMENT WHICH FOR THEM YOU KNOW MAY HAVE BEEN LOWER THAN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. AND THEIR ACTUAL COSTS IN PROVIDING CARE TO ONLY TAKE BACK FUNDING. TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY HAVE MORE REVENUE THAN THEY HAVE COST. WE CAN MAKE IT TO THAT WE CAN MAKE A DECISION. AS TO HOW MUCH TO CLUB BACK. FROM COUNTIES CAN'T ME RIGHT SO IT IS IN STATUTE THE A. B. EIGHTY FIVE FORMULA THE CHANGES THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED WITH RESPECT TO THIS AREN'T CHANGING WHAT RIVERSIDE FORMULA IS. IT'S IT'S BECAUSE THEY ALREADY PICKED THE FORMULA AND AREN'TA SIXTY FORTY COUNTY PRESUMABLY THIS WILL BE A TRAILER BILL OFFICE IN THE BUDGET AND RIGHT SO WE CAN ADJUST YOU COULD YOU COULD ADJUST THE FORMULA THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING THAT SOMEBODY TAKE A LOOK AT BECAUSE OF THE FULL. OF YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW I JUST THE FORMULA BUT ME A NIGHTMARE. I'VE SEEN SOME STATISTICS THAT INDICATE FOR EXAMPLE THE BAY AREA THE PER CAPITA. FUNDING FLOW IS ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER CAPITA AND IN RIVERSIDE AND SAN BERNARDINO COUNTIES IT'S ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS. PER CAPITA. NOW THAT'S A DIFFERENCE. AND IT'S A DIFFERENCE IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR A COUNTY TO MAKE UP. BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE SERVICES WERE TALKING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND THAT IMPACTS HOW WE DEAL WITH HOMELESS HOMELESSNESS AND ALL THE REST OF THE STUFF SO IF THERE'S A WAY. TO HELP COUNTIES THAT ARE UNDER FUNDED I AM ASKING THAT YOU TAKE A LOOK AT IT BECAUSE I KNOW POLITICALLY WE WILL NEVER [inaudible] PROBABLY. READJUST THE FUNDING FORMULA THE NINETEEN NINETY ONE FUNDING FORMULA BECAUSE TO DO SO WITH THAT AN INFLUX OF NEW MONEY. MEANS IT'S SOMEBODY'S LOSING A PROGRAM IN ORDER FOR SOMEBODY ELSE TO GAIN ONE SO BUT HERE YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE YOU'RE PULLING BACK MONEY FROM THE COUNTY. BECAUSE OF THIS NEW PROGRAM. TO TO ADJUST THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT YOU PULL ASKING. THANK YOU SPEAK MEASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SHOT I SHOULD MENTION THIS CAN'T WELL ACTUALLY YOUR HAIR'S RETESTED. FOR VALENTINE'S DAY. THERE YOU GO. THAT'S REAL COMMITMENTS. FOR SO I DID WANT TO BECAUSE OF MADE REFERENCE TO IT I KNOW THAT'S FALLS MORE SOCIAL SERVICE SIDE SO PERHAPS MORE QUESTION FOR FINANCE -- SO IN TERMS OF THE HSS PORTION -- HOW MUCH ARE WE LOOKING AT -- FOR FOR THIS POPULATION AND THEN IF WE WERE LOOKING BEYOND HOW FAST WITH THAT GO SO WE'RE LOOKING AT A HUNDRED NINETY FOUR MILLION GENERAL FUND -- THE FOR FOR THIS -- PROPOSED EXPANSION WHAT PROPORTION OF THAT'S AYE HSS. SUPPORT FOR THE ARM FOR THE FOR THE OVER -- TWENTY SIX POPULATION WE'RE STILL WORKING ON THAT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO COME UP WITH AN ESTIMATE. REGARDING THE THE PROPOSAL -- THAT'S BEFORE YOU SO THE FIRST YEAR THE COSTS ARE -- IT'S GOOD THERE'S A BOOK YOU KNOW A A DELAY A LAG AND THEN THERE'S A RAMP UP -- THOSE COSTS WILL GROW OVER TIME SO I THINK WE'RE ESTIMATING TWO POINT TWO MILLION FOR THE FIRST YEAR -- THEY WILL GROW -- I THINK WE'RE ESTIMATING LIKE TWENTY SIX MILLION OKAY -- AND THEN KEEPS GOING UP AFTER THAT WELL I MEAN SOME POINT THAT YOU SEE WITH THIS COMES THE POPULATION AGED SOURCE DID THE WHEN YOU STOP THE RAMP UP PARTS OF FEW YEARS SO I THINK I'M LOOKING AT AND WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT THAT. SORT OF LONG TERM WHAT IS OUT RANGE OF LIKE. IS IT FORTY MILLION APPROXIMATELY FORTY TO FORTY FIVE MILLION OKAY ITSELF ACTUALLY -- SMALL BUT IT'S CHUNK BUT STILL. YES SIGNIFICANT CHOCOLATE MODEL SIGNIFICAN RIGHT RIGHT AS LARA IS THE OTHER SIDE NUMBER THIS IS THE THE NINETEEN TO TWENTY SIX RIGHT EXACTLY SO SO I THINK. SO I THINK THAT ONE OF THINGS CERTAINLY WE DEFINITELY WHILE LOOK AS WE'RE LOOKING FARTHER OUT IS. WHAT HAPPENS TO THE AYE HSS? PORTION NOW I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT -- LOVED SO USUALLY THINK OF THE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE OR TWENTY SIX THAT'S A AS IT'S ONLY THREE HEALTHY AND THAT'S TRUE BUT YOU KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF CHILDREN WHO HAVE -- CONDITIONS AND DISABILITIES THAT -- STILL NEED HELP EVEN AFTER EIGHT SO I WOULD BE SURE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT. AS WELL -- NOW IN TERMS OF CCS ANY I GUESS EASIEST CUTS OFF AT EIGHTEEN ANYWAY BUT I MEAN I'M DISRUPTING ABOUT WHAT KIND OF SUPPORT FOR THAT I CARE WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE PROVIDE BY NOW INCLUDING THIS POPULATION -- FOR PEOPLE WITH -- WELL NOW YOUNG YOUNG ADULTS WITH A SIGNIFICANT -- CONDITIONS. EASIER TO GO TO TWENTY ONE SO THERE WILL BE SOME ADDITIONAL EXPANSION -- AND THAT'S ACCOUNTED FOR IN OUR COSTS RIGHT THOUGH I THINK THESE TO BE ON THAT IT'S YOU KNOW THE SAME SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE TO ANY OTHER FULL SCOPE MEDICAL BENEFITS YOUR AFTER THEY AGE OUT AND THE OPPORTUNITIES TO BE IN SOME OF OUR WAIVER PROGRAMS OR OTHER THINGS. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THOSE SUPPORTIVE AND MORE INTENSIVE SERVICES THAT THEY CURRENTLY GET OFTEN THREE CCS. OKAY WELL I THINK THIS IS A AND I REALIZE THAT MOST OF THIS FOCUSED ON COVERAGE -- AND WE'LL EXPLORE SOME OF THIS MORE IN OUR BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE -- AT A IS WERE LOOKING AT THIS SO IF I FOR THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT -- COORDINATION OF CARE HOW DO WE TRY TO REDUCE THE COST CURVE NOT ONLY OF COURSE FOR THIS POPULATION BUT MORE BROADLY. AT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S PEOPLE SAID IT WILL BE ONE TO GET MORE LOWER HEALTHCARE COSTS NOT JUST FOR THE STATE BUT ACTUALLY OVERALL. AND THEN -- WHAT ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO WITH MEDI CAL BEING A LARGE PURCHASER -- NO THIRD OF ALL CALIFORNIANS HALF OF ALL CHILDREN -- TO TRY TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM OF CARE AS WELL SO OKAY THANK YOU WELL. I AGREE WITH THE CHAIRS DISCUSSION ON THE HI IN. OF ABOUT ELIGIBILITY -- WHO GETS SERVED TO DOESN'T GET SERVED IS ALMOST LIKE A MORAL DECISION? WHICH IS. CREATE A LOT OF COMPLICATIONS IN MY MIND TO CHOOSE ONE GROUP THE NEEDS HEALTHCARE OVER ANOTHER GROUP I THINK [inaudible] THERE [inaudible] THERE'S SOME. THOUGHT THAT HAS TO BE PUT INTO THE A IN A REAL WAY. BEFORE WE JUST CHARGE IN DO THIS IN MY OPINION I MEAN. IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A JAR IS SO AND SO IS LIKE A MORAL DECISION YOU'RE MAKING. AND AND IS SOMEBODY'S COMMITTED -- TO UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE AS I HAVE BEEN -- I FIND IT TROUBLING I HAVE A QUESTION THOUGH-- FOR THE ELIGIBILITY -- PROCESS OF OUR ARE YOU SERVING THERE'S NO CHANGES IN THE ELIGIBILITY PROCESS AS IT STANDS NOW. WITH THE COUNTIES -- AMASSING THE SOCIAL SERVICE -- OF DEPARTMENT. YOU'RE ASSUMING THAT THE L. L. G. BILL THE PROCESS IS THE SAME. OUR AS WE HAVE NOW FOR THE COUNTY SCRIPT. YES -- ENSURING THAT THE CASE TOLD -- THE PRODIGIOUS PROVIDED WE HAVE ONE POINT 3% INTAKE. WITH WHAT THE CURRENT OF CASE WE ARE. FROM MEDI CAL TO I JUST SORT OF THERE'S NO CHANGE TO YOUR SYSTEM OKAY SO -- HAS THERE BEEN -- AS A SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCY -- DISCUSS THE OR EXPLORED -- MEDICO -- ELIGIBILITY SIMPLIFICATION -- HOW DOES THIS PROPOSAL OR MAYBE GOING TO A? BROADER -- UNIVERSAL. OF HEALTHCARE SYSTEM -- OF PRETTY OPPORTUNITY MAYBE. FOR RE EXAMINING THE ELIGIBILITY SYSTEM. AS WE KNOW IT -- IN TERMS OF PROCESSING PEOPLE TIMING. AND SO FORTH COULD DOES A SOCIAL SERVICES. ANY KIND OF ANSWER ON THAT ISSUE. SO JUST A STEP IN FOR MY COLLEAGUE HAS MEDI CAL ABILITIES ACTUALLY DONE THROUGH DTS AND NOT THROUGH SOCAL SERVICES OTHER COUNTIES TO THE COUNTY DO IT BUT IT THROUGH US -- YEAH SO -- CERTAINLY YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT HOW DO WE MAKE CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENTS -- PART OF THAT PART OF THE DECISION MAKING AND HOW WE'RE EXPANDING THE COVERAGE HERE WAS PART OF THAT SIMPLIFICATION WE DID NOT JUST LIKE FOR THE KIDS WE DID NOT INCLUDE WE DO NOT CREATE NEW AID CODES WHICH IS ITS OWN. CHALLENGING PROCESS WE ARE TRYING TO CONSOLIDATE INTO THE EXISTING AID CODES -- IN ADDITION CERTAIN AGE BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOW [inaudible] 200- THAT'S THAT'S WHY I'M TALKING ABOUT YES I IT SO. IT'S AN I WE THIS IS DEFINITELY AGREE DEFINITELY AGREE SENATOR BELL AND YOU CAN IF YOU TALK TO MY ELIGIBILITY PEOPLE YOU'LL TELL THEM. THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT I KEEP SAYING CAN GET TO LIKE TEN THEY TELL ME THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE BUT WE'RE GONNA TRY TO GET LOWER THAT'S MY GOAL. I PROMISE YOU IS MICHAEL. BUT SORT OF MONEY FOR THE COUNTIES TO IMPLEMENT A BILLS BE SYSTEM WITH HUNDREDS OF A CODE ABSOLUTELY -- SO I I KNOW THAT FOR A FACT. HIRE ALL THE ELIGIBILITY WORKERS WHEN I WAS A SUPERVISOR SO SO -- I LIKE I LIKE TO SEE -- IF WE'RE GOING IN A DIRECTION OF FULL. CARE FOR EVERYBODY. PART OF THE IMPORTANT JOB WE HAVE IS TO SIMPLIFY THE ELIGIBILITY PROCESS. AND CREATED A ELIGIBILITY PROCESS IS MUCH SIMPLER LESS EIGHT CODES. A SIMPLIFIED PROCESS BECAUSE WE'RE CHALLENGED WITH IN THIS CASE. OF THE PUBLIC CHARGE -- ISSUE WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE DISINCLINED TO WANT. TO UP PARTICIPATE IN THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE SO. WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO CHALLENGE OURSELVES. TO TO REINVENT THE ELIGIBILITY PROCESS. AND I I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A MAJOR PART OF THIS DECISION. THAT'S BEEN MADE BECAUSE I THINK IT HAS TO BE IF WE'RE MAKING CHANGES IN THE MEDICAL SYSTEM. ELIGIBILITY PROCESS IS IS CUMBERSOME COMPLICATED. IS IT -- CREATES -- MANY MISTAKES -- THE MORE THE MORE. CODE IT CODES WHERE PEOPLE WERE GOING FROM ONE A CODE TO ANOTHER FOR EXAMPLE. IT SEEMS LIKE IF THERE TWENTY SIX AND THEN THERE. TWENTY SEVEN THAT'S JUMPING FROM SOMETHING TO SOMETHING -- IF THEIR INCOME GOES UP AND DOWN I MEAN ALL THOSE KINDS OF FACTORS -- IT'S IT'S IT'S TIME THAT WE LOOK AT THE CHANGING OF THE ELIGIBILITY PROCESS SIMPLIFYING IT MAKE IT SIMPLE FOR THE CONSUMER CONSUMER FRIENDLY -- THAT'S GOT TO BE PART OF THIS I'M JUST I'M JUST SAYING RIGHT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATE BILL THAT'S A GOOD POINT TO RAISE AS I THINK WE HAVE THERE HAVE BEEN MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY SIMPLIFICATION BILL PACKAGES. FOR DECADES BUT WHAT I HEAR YOU SAYING WHICH I UNDERSTOOD YOUR TALK ABOUT A SIMPLIFICATION THE FRONT IN AND BACKING AND SIMPLIFICATION. OF FOR BENEFICIARY TO APPLY BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF THE BACK IN TERMS OF HOW IT'S ADMINISTERED -- AT THE STATE LEVEL AND THE COUNTY EXPERIENCE AS WELL I GOT IT SIMPLIFICATION ALL THE WAY AROUND THE FRONT LINE PEOPLE HAVE A LOT IDEAS ON THIS YES AND I THINK IF WE'RE ALSO OF STRATEGICALLY WE'RE GOING. TO UNIVERSAL. HEALTH CARE WE SHOULD START DOING THIS NOW BUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SIMPLIFY IT GOT IT THANK YOU SIR. CENTER WIECKOWSKI. GOING BACK TO I GUESS LISTENING TO MY COLLEAGUES AND SENATOR ROSS ISSUE ON THE CLOCK BACK YOU WERE TALKING SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS OUR HAND OUT ON PAGE SIX SHOWS THAT SOME ELEVEN COUNTIES ARE NOT. PROVIDING ANY NON EMERGENCY CARE RIGHT NOW FOR A FRIEND DOCUMENTS WHAT IS WRONG WHICH IS LETTING THEM HALF THE MONEY. IN SAYING YOU PROVIDING THE CARE NOW. WHY WOULD WHAT WHAT WHAT POSSIBLY COULD THE COUNTY HOSPITALS? TO THAT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE IT WOULDN'T BE PROVIDING SERVICES TO THE POPULATION AT THE SERVER IF WE JUST LET THEM KEEP MONEY. BUT BUT THERE'S A THERE'S ELEVEN THAT DON'T AND SOME OF THEM ARE BY PROVIDING SOME SAFETY NET WOODEN THE ON THE NATURAL WOULD NEED JUST PROVIDE MORE SERVICES. THEY HAD MORE MONEY. AND TRY TO WANT TO BE SO NAIVE. NO -- THANK YOU SENATOR -- WELL I I I I AGAIN THE PROPOSAL. FROM THE ADMINISTRATION REFLECTS THAT WE WOULD BE TAKING ON THAT RESPONSIBILITY AND I I UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT -- BUT FOR ON THE RESPONSIBILITY WE THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO MAKE THE ADJUSTMENT. AND I CAN JUST JUMP IN I MEAN I THINK THAT -- CERTAINLY WE KNOW OUR COUNTY PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS DO PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CARE AND WILL CONTINUE TO THAT TO WHOEVER REMAINS UNINSURED. I THINK -- THE REALITY IS THAT THERE IS MORE FUNDING IN TOTAL THAT THEY WOULD BE GETTING THROUGH AN EXPANSION TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES AND PROVIDE THEM ANYMORE MANAGED WAY. AND HAVING INDIVIDUALS HAVE ACCESS TO OTHER SERVICES THAT PERHAPS THEY DON'T HAVE IN THE COUNTIES TODAY BECAUSE YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW COUNTY SYSTEMS ARE VERY VARIED ACROSS THE STATE WITH SOME HAVING. SIGNIFICANT OUTPATIENT PRIMARY CARE AND OTHERS BEING MORE -- CONSTRAINT ON THAT SIDE SO WE VIEW IT AS A BENEFIT TO THE PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS TO DO THIS EXPANSION -- YES THERE IS MONEY COMING OUT IN THE IN THE REALIGNMENT REDIRECTION BUT THE OVERALL A EXPENDITURES FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS WE THINK WILL RESULT IN ON ON YOU KNOW REDUCING UNCOMPENSATED COSTS THAT THOSE COUNTIES ARE CURRENTLY -- PROVIDING AND THAT THE CARE WILL BE MORE COORDINATED. EVE EVEN THE CAVEAT THAT THE THE AYE HSS. PORTION OF IT IS GOING TO BE ANOTHER A BIGGER. AMOUNT OF LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR THE SENIOR POPULATION EVEN THOUGH IT'S ONLY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE IT JUST SEEMS THAT THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE IN THIS AREA EVEN THOUGH WE'RE ACCEPTING. MORE RESPONSIBILITY. FOR PERHAPS THE SIMPLEST OF A COHORT THE NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD SAID IN THE IN THE PEOPLE THAT AREN'T AREN'T COVERED I JUST. I JUST THROW IT OUT TO THAT IF WE DIDN'T CLUB BACK ANYTHING WAGES SUCKED UP TO SIXTY MILLION THAT THERE'S A POTENTIAL FOR FOR OTHER GOOD THINGS TO BE OCCURRED IN THIS POPULATION THAT WE'RE TRYING. TO IT'S NOT EXACTLY EXPANDING IT TO EVERYBODY BUT IT SAYS HERE WE COME [inaudible] THIS [inaudible] THROUGHOUT THE I'M. I'M STILL REALLY UNCLEAR IN TERMS OF WHY -- BE SELECTED THE NINETEEN TO TWENTY SIX AGE BRACKET -- SOME REFERENCE WAS MADE TO THE ACA BUT THE ACA DIDN'T USE THAT AGE TO EXCLUDE [inaudible] ANYBODY -- YOU NOT EXCLUDED FROM ANY BENEFITS FROM -- NINETEEN TO TWENTY SIX YOU HAD TO DO WITH WHETHER YOU GET COVERAGE UNDER YOUR YOUR YOUR ALL EXISTING HEALTH PLAN. TO EXTEND IT BUT IT WASN'T USED TO EXCLUDE ANYBODY -- IN FACT THE ONLY EXCLUSION UNDER THE ACA IS A FAIR AND DOCUMENT YOU CAN EVEN PURCHASE. INSURANCE IF YOU'RE A UNDOCUMENTED SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE THE RATIONALE OR THE OF WHY THIS PARTICULAR AGE WAS SELECTED -- AND AS SENATOR MITCHELL SAID WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS WHAT MY UNDERSTANDING IS WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE MOVING TOWARDS ELIMINATING THE UNINSURED AND THE WHOLE STATE THAT EVERYBODY HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE -- AND WE'RE GONNA DO THIS BY THESE LITTLE AGE BRACKETS WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE POLICY RATIONALE. UP IF WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS FULL CUP FULL ON MAKING SURE EVERYBODY HAS HEALTH INSURANCE ARE HEALTH THE HEALTH COVERAGE. AND WE GO FROM ZERO TO EIGHTEEN AND THEN WE GO FROM NINETEEN TO TWENTY SIX ARE WE GONNA DO THIS AND SEVEN YEAR INCREMENTS -- MEAN WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE RATIONALE -- SOMEONE MENTIONED WE'RE BUILDING ON WHAT'S BEEN DONE BUT WE WENT FROM ZERO TO EIGHTEEN TO NOW. YOU KNOW THE THE NUMBER IS SO MUCH SMALLER THAT WE'RE GOING TO COVER SO -- I WOULD RATHER THAT ARE RATIONALE BE BASED ON WE'RE MOVING. IN THIS IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET. TO QUICKLY WE'RE GOING TO GET TO EVERYBODY. I'D BEEN NO HAVE NO UNINSURED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I MEAN THERE'S BEEN. REALLY. BIG DEBATES AS I UNDERSTAND IT I WAS IN HERE. BUT WE ALL SAID OR ALL OF EVERYBODY UP HERE SAID WE WANT COVERAGE FOR EVERYBODY. THE I DON'T I DON'T GET HOW OLD THIS LITTLE [inaudible] PLEASE. OUGHT WAS ARRIVED AT AS A WAY TO GET TO WHERE WE REALLY WANT TO BE WHICH IS EVERYBODY COVERED. LARA ALLIED DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- I THINK YOUR POINTS ARE WELL TAKEN AND I THINK THAT ULTIMATELY. LIKE THE GOVERNOR HAS SEATED AIDS IT IS THE FIRST PREVIOUSLY NOTED THAT COST TO BUILD ON SB THIRTY FIVE IS POPULATION -- IS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED NINETY FOUR MILLION FOR MEDI CAL BENEFIT COSTS WHEREAS EXPANDING THROUGH THE AGE OF SIXTY FOUR AND ABOVE IS A ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION GENERAL FUND COSTS FOR MEANT FOR JUST FOR MEDI CAL NINE NOT INCLUDING I JUST AS COSTS SO. I THINK IT'S A BOTH -- BUILDING ON SB SEVENTY FIVE IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE COVERAGE THAT INDIVIDUALS MAY GET YOU KNOW THE AND AS REQUIRED THROUGH THE ACA THROUGH THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE BUT ALSO THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT -- FISCAL DECISION THAT THAT WAS MADE. DO YOU HAVE A NUMBER AS TO WHAT IT WOULD COST TO COVER EVERYONE. IN THE STATE TO ELIMINATE THE UNINSURED THAT. EVERYBODY OR JUST AND DOCUMENTAL HAVE FOR EVERYBODY TO REDUCE THE ANYBODY NOW NOT FOR EVERYBODY -- I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE THAT. I HAVE WE WERE MORE IN THE WORKS OF PUTTING TOGETHER AN ESTIMATE LOOKING AT THE MEDI CAL AND I HSS COSTS FROM THE UNDOCUMENTED -- BUT YOU KNOW COVERING EVERYBODY WOULD BE KIND OF OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF DH CS AT THIS HEARING TODAY. FROM I ADD ON TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE SAID A MOMENT AGO -- YEAH I THINK THE GOVERNOR'S MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE HAS A GOAL TO COVER ALL OF THESE FOLKS AND SO. YOU KNOW. I WOULD OFFER THAT -- GIVEN THE THE THE CAR -- AND AGAIN WE'LL HAVE TO GET BACK WITH YOU ON THE AYE HSS COMPONENT OF THAT BUT AS AS MERRY DESCRIBED EARLIER -- SOMETHING LIKE ONE POINT SEVEN ONE POINT. EIGHT BILLION FOR JUST THE MEDI CAL PART OF THAT -- THAT WOULD BE A VERY DIFFICULT COSTS TO ACCOMMODATE IN ONE YEAR AND UNDER THE BUDGET PROPOSAL IT WOULD PROBABLY MEAN HAVING TO DO PULL BACK ON SOMETHING. ELSE. THIS WAS THE RIGHT MIX FOR THE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S STANDPOINT I WOULD ALSO ADD -- THIS BUDGET DOES QUITE A BIT -- REGARDING -- YOU KNOW BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF PENSION PAYMENTS AND CLEANING UP BUDGETARY DEBT THAT'S GOING TO READ THAT'S GOING TO BE REVEALED. REAL SAVINGS IN THE FUTURE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WILL ALLOW THE STATE TO CONTINUE MAKING PROGRESS LIKE THIS -- SO. YEAH BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION WE'RE CERTAINLY YOU KNOW HEARING THESE THESE PERSPECTIVES RALLY THINGS. SENATOR STONE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION AND YOU KNOW WE SAW A LOT OF CUTS WITH THE RETURN RECESSION I I TALKED ABOUT BEFORE AND IF. IS THE IS THE GOVERNOR CONSIDERING AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH -- POTENTIALLY THIS -- THIS PLAN. AND AND MAYBE THE F. R. FURTHER EXPANSION. TO RESTORING SOME OF THE BENEFITS AND THE MEDICAL-PROGRAM PODIATRY AUDIOLOGY AND CON AND SCREAMS. PROVIDER RATES IS IS IS THAT EMANATING IN THE IN THE IN THE OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR -- TO PROVIDE A HOLISTIC. HEALTH CARE PLAN FOR PEOPLE TO TO EMBRACE NUMBER. ONE NUMBER. TWO ASSUMING A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR COST ONE NINETY FOUR MILLION TO THE GENERAL FUND -- WE'RE NOT GONNA GET ANY -- FEDERAL ASSISTANCE THAT'S GONNA BE 1100% -- STATE -- BUT HAD WE USE THAT MONEY FOR ENHANCEMENT OF THESE OTHER SERVICES OF WHAT KIND OF FEDERAL FUNDS ARE WE LEAVING OFF THE TABLE. SO OBVIOUSLY I WOULD NEVER DARE TO SPEAK FOR THE GOVERNOR BUT I'LL TRY TO ANSWER SOME OF THE PIECES I MEAN I THINK YOU KNOW IT AS AS OUR DEPARTMENT FINANCE COLLEAGUES SAID THERE HAD TO BE CHOICES MADE IN SORT OF WHAT WAS BEING DONE -- SO WHILE WE WHILE THE GOVERNOR DID NOT SPECIFICALLY PROPOSED TO RESTORE BENEFITS OR TO UNDO THE CUTS THAT STILL REMAIN ALTHOUGH NOT ALL OF THEM DO YOU. THERE IS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE PROP FIFTY SIX MONEY THAT'S GOING TO INCREASED PROVIDER RATES SO IT'S NOT A DIRECT UNDOING OF THE CUTS BUT IT'S A A SEPARATE WAY OF PROVIDING FUNDING AND INCREASE THAT AMOUNT -- BY A FEW HUNDRED MILLION IN PROP FIFTY SIX MONEY FOR THIS UPCOMING YEAR -- AS YOUR SECOND QUESTION THAT WE'VE DONE THAT ANALYSIS I DON'T KNOW THAT HOW. EASY THAT ANNOUNCES WOULD BE -- I WOULD SAY THAT WE DO GET FEDERAL FUNDS FOR THIS POPULATION BECAUSE WE STILL CONTINUE TO CLAIM. FOR THE LIMITED SCOPE SERVICES SO THAT'S WHY OUR TOTAL FUND IS TWO FIFTY SEVEN BUT OUR GENERAL FUND IS ONE NINETY FOUR SO WE ARE GETTING ABOUT SIXTY FOUR MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS -- SO YES IF THIS WAS FOR FULL YOU KNOW FULLY FEDERALLY ELIGIBLE FOLKS IT WOULD -- DRAWDOWN ADDITIONAL FEDERAL MONEY BUT IT WOULD BE GOING FROM ZERO TO SOMETHING IT WOULD BE GOING FROM SIXTY FOUR TO PROBABLY LIKE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD OAK DON'T LIKE QUOTE ME ON THE HUNDRED AND THEN FINALLY -- WE HAVE A A WAIVER WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT IS EXPIRING IN TWENTY TWENTY AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND AND NEGOTIATE -- HOW WE'RE GOING? TO PAY FOR THE SERVICES WITH FEDERAL FUNDS IN THE FUTURE. ASSUMING THAT THIS -- THIS. IDEA OF SERVICES BETWEEN NINETEEN AND TWENTY SIX AND I SHARE THE CONCERNS. OF THE SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES AND MY MY COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE -- THAT. THE NEED IS PROBABLY MUCH GREATER THE SIXTY FIVE YEAR OLDS TO OVER -- AM AM PROBABLY -- ACCESS OUR EMERGENCY ROOMS AND I HAVE A HAVE A COSTS IT IS SAID THAT THAT IS RATHER SIGNIFICANT BUT EMBRACING WHATEVER PROGRAM WE ULTIMATELY EMBRACE IS PROBABLY GOING TO CONTINUE TO DRAW MORE. UNDOCUMENTED AGREEMENT IMMIGRANTS TO THE PROGRAM DO YOU SEE THIS IN ANYWAY JEOPARDIZING OUR ABILITY TO GO -- EIGHT UP IN A POSITIVE WAY -- FOR THE STATE -- WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THAT'S A HARD QUESTION TO TO ANSWER I MEAN CERTAINLY CALIFORNIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN MUCH MORE EXPANSIVE -- IN OUR COVERAGE WE'VE WE'VE CURRENTLY PROVIDE FULL COVERAGE TO THOSE WHO ARE OTHERWISE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR A FEDERALLY COVERED WHO ARE DOCUMENTED CITIZENS -- OBVIOUSLY THAT SHOT THE CHILDREN EXPANSION THAT WE DID LAST YEAR WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANY SPECIFIC. CONCERNS OR ISSUES -- AS LONG AS WORK YOU KNOW APPROPRIATELY A HUGE STATEMENT ON WHAT -- WE DO WITH OUR STATE FUNDS CERTAINLY THE ISSUE OF THE WE WERE EXPIRING NEXT YEAR IS ONE THAT WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT -- I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT IN IN SOME STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS IN TERMS OF THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF A WILL PROBABLY NEED TO ASK FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON THE ACTUAL WEAVER SIDE WILL PROBABLY BE DECREASED. AND WILL BE LOOKING AT HOW DO WE USE SORT OF LESS SUBJECTIVE AUTHORITIES FROM THE FEDERAL SIDE TO IT. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MAINTAINING ALL THE MONEY SO WE ARE THINKING THROUGH FOR ALL OF THOSE. IMPACTS -- BUT YEAH THAT THERE HAS NOT CMS IS NOT RAISE ANY PARTICULAR ISSUES TO US ABOUT -- OUR PRIOR EXPANSIONS OR THEY ARE ALSO AWARE OF THIS PROPOSED EXPANSION AS LONG AS WERE. DOCUMENTING APPROPRIATELY THE JUST THE FEDERAL FUNDS PIECE THAT THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU CAN YOU EDUCATE ME EVEN FORGIVE MY IGNORANCE WITH RESPECT TO THE NEXUS BETWEEN. EXPANDING -- MEDICAL COVERAGE TO A DOCUMENT AS AND THE THE NEXUS TO AYE HSS COVERAGE UNDERSTANDING THAT. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT AYE HSS IS A IS A FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAM -- BUT IT BUT IS THERE IF WE IF WE OFFER -- ON DOCKS -- FIVE YEAR OLDS ARE ORDER WITH MEDI CAL COVERAGE DOESN'T HAVE TO COME ALL OR NOTHING WITH HSS EVEN THE STATE'S BACK FILLING IT. BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF THE RED FLAGS HERE TODAY SUCH AS A VERY EXPENSIVE PROGRAM -- CAN CAN WE OFFER ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER -- IS A WAY TO I'M SORRY INCREMENTALLY GET TO WHERE -- THIS THE LEGISLATURE ONCE AGO SURE CERTAINLY SO THERE WOULD NOT BE A FEDERAL REQUIREMENT TO EXTEND NAY TO ASSESS -- TO THIS POPULATION SINCE IT'S NOT A FEDERALLY REQUIRED POPULATION SO THAT WOULD BE A DECISION THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR WOULD BE MAKING ABOUT DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'VE DONE BEFORE WHICH IS WHEN WE HAVE EXPANDED FULL SCOPE COVERAGE WE GIVE THOSE INDIVIDUALS THE FULL SCOPE. OF ALL OF THE BENEFITS WHICH IS INCLUSIVE OF AYE TO ASSESS AND MANY OTHER THINGS BUT CERTAINLY THAT'S NOT REQUIRED FOR MANY FEDERAL PERSPECTIVE IT IS A STATE DECISION. AND YOU HAVE -- IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO GET THE COST OF WITH THE I. JUSTICE COSTS WOULD BE. FOR THE THE ELDERLY POPULATION THAT SEEMS TO BE -- COST PROHIBITIVE IN IN THE EYES OF WHAT I'M HEARING HERE TODAY IN OUR DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND DEPARTMENT FINDS ARE WORKING ON THAT AND SO CERTAINLY WILL GET BACK TO YOU RETREAT THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE FINAL QUESTIONS DR GRANT A JUST BRIEFLY -- SO AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT HOUSES A BE HELPFUL TO HAVE A BREAKDOWN OF THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS FOR A SPECIAL. THAT. I THINK WITH THIS AGE GROUP. FOR WE'LL DO OUR OUR SIDE I THINK AS YOU KNOW WE DO SORT OF PM OVERALL PM PM'S AND SO WE'LL PROBABLY HAVETO MAKE SOME ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT PERCENTAGES BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO DO THE BEST THAT WE CAN THEN OBVIOUSLY I TO SAYS IS BEING CALCULATED SEPARATELY [inaudible] THE WRONG. ME JUST ASK ONE QUICK QUESTION ABOUT MY UNDERSTANDING THE PREMISE BEHIND THE AGES SAYS PROGRAM IS. YOU KEEP PEOPLE HOME FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU KEEP THEM OUT OF HIGH COST INSTITUTIONS. YOU YOU I ASSUME YOU HAVE TO BUILD IN SOME COST SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ISS HSS PROGRAM. AN ADDITION TO JUST WHAT THE BILL IS RIGHT DOESN'T IT IMPACT YOUR OVERALL. MEDI CAL. COST IF YOU DON'T HAVE A AGES SAYS AND YOU HAVE PEOPLE IN INSTITUTIONS. SO I JUST I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I'M UNDERSTANDING SO IF IF WE WERE YOU KNOW TAKING THE PATH THAT THAT SENATOR STONE WAS. DISCUSSING WHETHER THE COST ON THE MEDICARE ON THE NON ART IS ASIDE WE NEED TO INCREASE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT I JUST AS WASN'T KEEPING PEOPLE OUT OF NURSING SOI THAT IS A FAIR QUESTION I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER WE'VE NEVER LOOKED AT IT BY ABOUT. SORT OF DIVIDING UP THE BENEFITS THAT WE WE WOULD HAVE TO COME UP WITH A METHODOLOGY BUT I THINK IT'S A FAIR QUESTION THAT WE WOULD NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT AND I THINK THAT'S TRUE OF ANY BENEFIT RIGHT I MEAN I THINK. TO THE DEGREE WE MAKE. DECISIONS ON CERTAIN BENEFITS IT COULD AFFECT THE OVERALL COST BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY EVEN THOUGH WE DO. HELP FUND THE AGES HAS SAID OF THE CAL THE FEDERAL SIDE NOBODY'S RECOGNIZE THE SAVINGS AND WE DON'T GET CREDIT FOR THE SAVINGS THAT WE HAVE TO CORRECT. CREW TO THE FEDERAL. MEDICARE MEDICAID PROGRAM YEAH I MEAN I THINK ONE OF THE THE CHALLENGES IN THE WAY THAT SOME OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WORKS ON EXPANDING FULL SCOPE TO THOSE WHO HAVE. WE GET SOME PORTION OF FEDERAL FUNDS IS ON THE ON THAT DEPARTMENT SIDE WE DO THAT BASED ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS SO WE WENT WE'VE HAD. YOU KNOW REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT I'M JUST I DON'T REMEMBER THE NUMBER SO DON'T QUOTE ME ON THIS BUT LIKE 45% OF THE COST WOULD OTHERWISE BE EMERGENCY COSTS THAT'S HOW WE GET TO THAT SORT OF SPLIT THAT YOU SEE. HERE WHERE WE'RE GETTING FEDERAL FUNDS SINCE NO PART OF AYE TO SAYS IS CONSIDERED EMERGENCY SERVICE A. AS IT IS A 100% STATE FUNDED AND SO THAT S ONE OF THE THE CHALLENGES AND CERTAINLY -- TO YOUR POINT IF IT WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN HIGHER OTHER COSTS THE PERCENTAGE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD GO UP IF WE-DIDN'T COVER I JUST US -- BUT THEY YES THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THEY WOULD PROBABLY RECOGNIZE OUR ADDRESS. THANK YOU THANK YOU MANAGER. THE OUR FIRST -- PRESENTER YOU KNOW THAT. I KNOW WE TEND TO ASSOCIATE AYE TSS SERVICES WITH THE ELDERLY BUT I'D JUST SAYS SERVICES CAN BE APPLIED TO ANYONE OF ANY AGE IF THEY HAVE A DISABILITY. AND SORRY. SEEING A SLIDE THAT TALKED ABOUT INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES -- HERE IT IS PAGE. ELEVEN BOMB AND IT TALKS ABOUT A HUNDRED FOUR THOUSAND YOUNG ADULTS. I TWO PUT AT SO THIS. AND SO YOU'RE FACTORING IN CURRENTLY IN TERMS OF YOUR ESTIMATES POTENTIAL I TO ASSESS COSTS. FOR EVEN YOUNGER UNDOCUMENTED RESIDENTS CORRECT THEY'RE NOT IN OUR ESTIMATE BUT YES THIS IN THE SOCIAL SERVICES ESTIMATE THEY ARE -- S. AS ASSUMING THOSE COSTS. I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR. FOR THE BILL ADDED ANOTHER QUESTION -- ONE MORE QUESTION LIKE COLUMBO. IRAQ ALONE THAT'S I I WANTED TO KNOW -- THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- WITH THE WAIVER IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR US HE'S COMING YEAR AND THE LEGISLATURE IN THIS COMMITTEE AND THE WHOLE LEGISLATION BE. FULLY ENGAGED IN. WHEN YOU KNOW THAT THE ISSUE AND I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE THAT? WE NEED TO KIND OF FULLY ENGAGE OURSELVES AND UNDERSTANDING THAT I HAD I HAD ONE PARTICULAR SERVED US A MENTAL HEALTH QUESTION -- ONE OF THE BIG -- PROBLEMS WITH -- ESSENTIALLY GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF INSTITUTIONAL FACILITIES LIKE. STATE HOSPITALS OR LA COUNTY JAIL FOR EXAMPLE THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN LA MADE SOME DECISIONS. TO START TALKING ABOUT A MENTAL HEALTH FOR A FACILITY BUT THEY HAVE THIS PROBLEM. IN IMPLEMENTING THAT WITH THE THE WAIVER THE I AM THE ISSUE. TO REQUEST THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE IS THE DEPARTMENT TO MAKE SOME EFFORT TO ALLOW CALIFORNIA [inaudible] TO BE EXCLUDED FROM THAT LAW AND AND PROCEED WITH -- THAT ISSUE SO WE CAN HAVE THESE -- PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS. OF IN CALIFORNIA. YES SO -- STATUS OF THE ON SHORE SO WE OBVIOUSLY DO YOU ALREADY HAVE THAT WITH RESPECT TO THE SUBURBS USES SIDE WE'VE BEEN HAD WE'VE HAD THAT FOR SEVERAL YEARS OF THE WAIVER. THINK THIS IS A NEW OPPORTUNITY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE -- IS A PART OF OUR OVERALL PLANNING AS WE LOOK AT OUR WEAVERVILLE NOT ONLY ARE ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER -- BUT ALSO OUR MENTAL HEALTH WAIVERS IS ALSO EXPIRING NEXT YEAR AND SO IT THAT'S A PART OF THAT THAT WHOLE PROCESS THAT WILL BE STARTING -- SOME STAKEHOLDER WORK IN THE FALL IN TERMS OF WHAT THINGS NEED TO BE INCLUDED HOW WOULD-THEY BE FUNDED. OBVIOUSLY JUST LIKE WITH THE SEVENS USE DISORDER -- WAIVER YOU KNOW IT IS SOMETHING THAT THEN COUNTIES OFTEN TO YOU SINCE COUNTIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FUNDING SO WE DON'T HAVE ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES RIGHT EVEN ON THE SENTENCE YOU SIDE. SO THAT'S JUST ANOTHER THING TO ADD TO KEEP IN WE PAY FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IT WOULD REALLY NEED TO BE ALSO BE A COUNTY DECISION TO WANT TO PROVIDE THAT -- I AM CERTAIN THERE PROBABLY SOME THAT WOULD -- THE CITY -- YEAH WELL JETER THE PRISONS YOUR ARM ON THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE MANAGER AND SKINNER -- WE WERE LIKE. KIND OF TAKEN ABACK WITH THE MULTI BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE. AND WE AND AND NO INCREASE IN THE POPULATION. SO I THINK SOME OF US OUT SO WHY IS THAT HAPPENING. WELLS BECAUSE OF FORTY FIVE HUNDRED ADDITIONAL PEOPLE. IN THE STATE PRISON WERE REQUIRED TO HAVE EXTRA MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. IN THE STATE PRISON. IN THE COSTS OF HEALTHCARE IN THE STATE PRISON IS GONE UP WE NOW SPEND NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER INMATE. NOW [inaudible] I I THINK THE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SAVING MONEY. IF YOU ADD IN THE COUNTY'S JAIL. LIKE WHAT LOS ANGELES DOING IS IS FISCALLY CORRECT TO DO. THIS TO GET THESE PEOPLE OUT OF SERVICE IN HUMANE. SITUATION AND PUT INTO A THERAPEUTIC HEALTH CARE FACILITY. AND I THINK A. WE AT THE STATE NEED TO THINK THE SAME WAY. AS THEY WERE DOING WITH OUR STATE FACILITIES WE NEED TO KIND OF HAVE A A PLANT. SO THAT'S WHERE WE NEED THIS WAIVER. NOT WE'RE SPENDING BILLIONS EVERY YEAR. THAT WE COULD BE SPENDING WITH MEDI CAL MATCH. CORRECT. UNION AMERICA BECAUSE THE STATE PRISON WE HAVE TO PAY FOR IT OF THE GENERAL FROWNED. ACOSTA 100% STATE GENERAL FUND. IF WE HAD THESE FACILITIES INTO COMMUNITIES PSYCHIATRIC SECURE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS WE COULD WE COULD THEN. CARE FOR PEOPLE REDUCE RECIDIVISM AND LOWER COST. AN I TAKE THIS AS THIS OUT SO THAT'S WHY I KEEP INSISTING. THAT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM HAS TO HAS TO BE LOOKED AT TOGETHER. IN CALIFORNIA IN OUR BUDGET IF WE DON'T IF WE KEEP LOOKING AT IT LIKE WE HAVE IN THE FILES IN SILOS. WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT GOING TO SAVE ANY MONEY IN THE SO I I I INSISTED THAT WAIVER. BE A PRIORITY THIS YEAR BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE'RE GONNA HAVE ANOTHER BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IN THE BUDGET OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM RIGHT MISSY ON MY CONSERVATIVE FISCAL. AND THEN HEAD SINCE THEY KNOW THE F. THE MEN CORNER OF THEIR SENATOR BILL THAT'S THE AMEN CORNER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- TO THE PANEL WE APPRECIATE YOU COLLEAGUES WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON WITH OUR OF ELEVEN FORTY HAVING ARRIVE -- TO OUR US STAKEHOLDER PANEL -- AGAIN UNDER THE EXPANSION. SECTION OF OUR AGENDA WE'RE GONNA HAVE REPRESENTATIVES COME FORTH FROM THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRATION POLICY CENTER. HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA. AND COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FIRST FROM MISTER. YEAH SO GAG MOESHA GAG NEEDS TO PRONOUNCE YOUR FIRST NAME FOR ME. DEEP AND I HAVE THAT RIGHT. DEEP INDIGNATION WHO'S THE SENIOR LET'S SAY THE ADVOCATE FROM THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER HE'LL BE FOLLOWED BY EVERYBODY'S FAVORITE BETH DETAIL. POLICY ADVOCATE WITH HEALTH ACCESS CAL SAY THAT BECAUSE BETH AND I WORKED TOGETHER. FOR LONGER THAN WE EITHER OF US WOULD CARE TO ACKNOWLEDGE. FOLLOWED BY MISS MICHELLE GIVENS IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA MYSTIC EGNATIA THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU AND AGAIN MY NAME IS STEVEN TCHNICIAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER. WHERE THE PROD CO SPONSORS OF THE PROPOSAL TO EXTEND MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY TO ALL INCOME ELIGIBLE RESIDENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS AND WE DO WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR INCLUDING HIS INITIAL PROPOSAL I'M TO AGES? TWENTY FIVE OMINOUS JANUARY TENTH BUDGET. CALIFORNIA LEAD THE COUNTRY IN EXPANDING OB PULLED PRO IMMIGRANT POLICIES SUCH AS HEALTH FOR ALL KIDS -- WHICH TO DATE HAS AND ROLLED OVER TWO HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND UNDOCUMENTED LOW INCOME CHILDREN WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE NOT HAVE ANY ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES -- THESE CHILDREN LIKE WAS MENTIONED BEFORE WILL AGE OUT -- OF MEDI CAL AT THE AGE OF NINETEEN AND WE DO AGREE THAT WOULD CREATE ITS OWN CHILLING EFFECT. ONE OUT OF TWO CHILDREN -- IN CALIFORNIA HAS AN IMMIGRANT PARENT BUT IMPORTANTLY ONE OUT OF SIX HAS A PARENT WHO IS UNDOCUMENTED. SADLY THESE PARENTS ALONG WITH OLDER SIBLINGS AND GRANDPARENTS -- CONTINUE TO BE SYSTEMATICALLY EXCLUDED FROM ACCESSING COMPREHENSIVE IN PRINT PREVENTATIVE HEALTHCARE. AMONG THE MANY STORIES HAVE FAMILIES DEVASTATED BY THEIR% LACK OF HEALTH INSURANCES THAT OF MARIA AND HOBBY ERR. THEIR PARENTS TO THREE CHILDREN -- WHO RESIDE JUST OUT OF SAN FRANCISCO? WHEN HAVE YEAR WAS DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES? HE AND HIS WIFE TRAVEL TO MEXICO FOR INSULIN. LAST YEAR THEY CROSS THE BORDER JUST TO GET INSULIN. AND THEY DIDN'T RETURN TO THEIR CHILDREN OUR COMMUNITY. THIS STORY AS WELL AS COUNTLESS OTHERS SHOW THE PAINFUL REALITY THAT FAMILY SEPARATION IS NOT JUST A RESULT OF WALLS AND BANDS FAMILY SEPARATION CAN ALSO RESULT FROM DEEP IN EQUITIES AND OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. HEALTHCARE IS ALSO INTEGRAL TO THE CURRENT CONVERSATION AROUND ECONOMIC DISPARITIES IN OUR STATE AS WAS ALSO MENTIONED UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS PAY AN ESTIMATED THREE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS EVERY YEAR AND STATE AND LOCAL TAXES AND MAKE UP ALMOST ONE TENTH OF OUR STATE'S WORK FORCE. AND DESPITE CONTRIBUTING SO SIGNIFICANTLY TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC VITALITY TO THEIR LABOR AND TAXES THEY'RE EGREGIOUSLY EXCLUDED FROM THE PROSPERITY WHICH THEY HAVE HELPED TO GENERATE. WHEN AND UNDOCUMENTED ADULT GETS INJURED ON THE JOB THEY HAVE FEW OPTIONS TO ACCESS CARE? IF AN ILLNESS DOESN'T GO AWAY BY ITSELF THE CONSEQUENCE IS PERMANENT DISABILITY OR DEATH. UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS CUT CONSTITUTE THE SINGLE LARGEST GROUP IN CALIFORNIA'S REMAINING UNINSURED POPULATION -- AND WE CERTAINLY AGREE THAT BROADER CONVERSATION DOES NEED TO HAPPEN -- BECAUSE IT'S MORE URGENT NOW THAN EVER THAT -- OUR LEADERSHIP AND CARING FOR AN UPHOLDING THE DIGNITY OF OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES -- IS -- AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE CONVERSATION WE HAVE THE WILL AND RESOURCES TO DO THIS -- TOGETHER AND REACH OUR GOAL THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GONNA HOLD ALL THE QUESTIONS TO THE IN THE FULL PANEL THANK YOU MISTER BELL. A BILL HEALTH FOR HEALTH TAXES CALIFORNIA WE'RE PROUD TO SPONSOR WITH CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER. THE EFFORT TO GET TO HELP FOR ALL TO COVER ALL UNDOCUMENTED ADULT IN CALIFORNIA AND TO DO SO WITH THE SAME BENEFIT PACKAGE THAT EVERY OTHER CALIFORNIAN IS ENTITLED. TO WE'VE LISTENED TO THE DISCUSSION HERE TODAY AND I WANT TO NOTE THAT IF YOU'RE OVER SIXTY FIVE OR IF YOU'RE UNDER EIGHTEEN AND YOU NEED HOME CARE YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE HOME CARE RATHER THAN SAYING THAT A FAMILY MEMBER HAS TO BE OUT. OF THE WAGE PAYING ECONOMY IN ORDER TO CARE FOR YOU THAT. WE HAVE HOME CARE. MOST PEOPLE WHO PROVIDE HOME CARE NOW OUR FAMILY MEMBERS AND THAT'S A GOOD THING IT'S SO HOW IT SHOULD BE. AND A HIGH PERSONALLY AM PROUD OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RECOGNIZES THEIR LABOR BECAUSE MOST OF THEM ARE WOMEN. I ALSO WANT TO PUT A FINER POINT ON OF THE DISCUSSION ABOUT RESTRICTED SCOPE WE TALK ABOUT SORT OF BLISSFULLY THAT YOU GET A BURKE CHEN C. OLY CARE BUT YOU DON'T CARE PRIMARY PREVENTIVE CARE LET ME. IN SPLITS THOSE AMONG YOU WHO HAVE WORKED WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED NO OR UNINSURED FOR ANY REASON. KNOW THE REALITY OF LIVING SICKER DYING YOUNGER AND BEING ONE EMERGENCY ROOM VISIT AWAY FROM BANKRUPTCY. IF YOU HAVE ASTHMA YOU DON'T GET THE MEDICATION TO CONTROL YOUR ASTHMA WHEN YOUR ASTHMA IS SO BAD YOU'RE ENDANGERING YOUR LIFE YOU WILL GET A TREATMENT IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM BUT SHE WON'T GET ONGOING MEDICATIONS. THE FAMILY WHO WERE THE ONGOING DOCTOR VISITS THE TESTS. AT ONE POINT TO ONE OF OUR COUNTIES IN IN CALIFORNIA THE DIABETES MANAGEMENT PROGRAM WAS THAT THE HEALTH DIRECTOR. VISITED THE PEOPLE WHO HAD AMPUTATIONS. K. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IF YOUR DIABETES ISN'T ISN'T MANAGE TO HAVE AMPUTATIONS THERE ARE ANY NUMBER OF ACADEMIC STUDIES ABOUT. DIABETES AND THE UNINSURED HEARING CALIFORNIA THAT SHOW THE RATE OF AMPUTATIONS ARE HIGHER FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE COVERAGE. IT'S ALSO THE RATE OF BLINDNESS SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PEOPLE NEEDING CARE. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT KEEPING PEOPLE OF THE EMERGENCY ROOM IT'S ABOUT KEEPING THEM. IN THE COMMUNITY WORKING CONTRIBUTING PAYING THEIR TAXES BEING PART OF THEIR FAMILIES. THE SAME THING IS TRUE FOR CANCER. AN AUNT WHO HAD BREAST CANCERS CHILD STOLE TO THE SOLUTION THE CARE SHE RECEIVED WAS WHEN SHE SCREAMED LOUDLY ENOUGH THAT THE NEIGHBORS CALLED THE COPS. THEY TOOK HER TO COTTAGE HOSPITAL IN SANTA BARBARA WITH THE FOR PAIN MEDS SHE WASN'T SCREENED SHE WASN'T TREATED SHE WASN'T PROVIDED ANY OTHER CARE MY GRANDFATHER SPEND HIT. HER LAST YEAR'S CARING FOR HOME THOSE ARE THE REALITIES OF BEING UNINSURED SO WE SORT OF PASS OVERWRITTEN TALK ABOUT PRIDE PEOPLE DON'T GET PRIMARY PREVENTIVE CARE. I WANTED TO PUT A SHARPER POINT FOR ON IT FOR YOU ISSUE MAKES THIS THESE DECISIONS ABOUT WHO'S GOING TO GET HERE. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET COVERAGE WHEN IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WE'VE BEEN WORKING FOR HEALTH FOR ALL FOR MORE THAN FIVE YEARS NOW? WE'RE HAPPY THAT WE'VE MADE SOME PROGRESS WE'RE DELIGHTED THAT THE GOVERNOR SAYS HE'S COMMITTED TO ALL. BUT SOMETIMES WE GET A LITTLE IMPATIENT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT REAL PEOPLE -- FINALLY WITH RESPECT TO REALIGNMENT. THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO TAKE A THIRD OF THE MONEY BUT THE ONLY PROPOSED COVER 10% OF THE PEOPLE YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT THAT -- YOU ALSO MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT SOME COUNTIES TO A FAIR AMOUNT SOME COUNTIES DON'T DO VERY MUCH. AND SOME COUNTIES HAVE RECENTLY STARTED DOING MORE WEATHERED SACRAMENTO OR THE CMS PEAK COUNTIES THAT HAVE RECENTLY EMBARKED ON DOING MORE SHE'D WANT TO KEEP THAT IN MIND AS YOU'RE THINKING. IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO EVERYBODY THIS YEAR. WE SURE HOPE. AS YOU THINK ABOUT THIS -- WE'D ASK YOU TO KEEP THOSE SORTS OF FACTORS IN MIND IN ALSO TO REMEMBER. IT'S NOT JUST DOLLARS IT'S REAL PEOPLE IN REAL CARE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS GIVENS. GOOD MORNING MICHELLE GIVEN THAT THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE'RE MANDATED TO PROVIDE INDIGENT HEALTH SERVICES AND PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES TO OUR COMMUNITIES. AT CHECK HAS BEEN SUPPORTIVE AND CONTINUES TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF EXPANDING MEDIC HELD HER ALL INDIVIDUALS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION WE SUPPORTED LAST YEAR'S BILLS IN BUDGET PROPOSALS. AND TO EXPAND COVERAGE TO UNDOCUMENTED YOUNG ADULTS AND SENIORS AND WE'RE REALLY PLEASED TO SEE THE GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S PRIORITIZED EXPENDING MEDIC CAL. HOWEVER OUR CONCERN IS THAT -- IT IN GENERAL FINANCING ADDITIONAL EXPANSIONS OF MEDIC HAL USING ADDITIONAL COUNTY REALIGNMENT DOLLARS IT JUST GIVES US GREAT PIES AND I'M HERE TODAY TO TO JUST HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THE ADVERSE IMPACTS TO COUNTIES THAT -- WEREN'T YOUR CONSIDERATION ONE CRITICAL USE OF HEALTH REALIGNMENT DOLLARS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOES NOT ADDRESS IS THE PROVISION OF PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES -- UNDER AB EIGHTY FIVE THE FORMULA INCLUDES A MECHANISM TO ALLOW COUNTIES TO RETAIN A PERCENTAGE OF FUNDING THAT WAS HISTORICALLY USED FOR PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES. HOWEVER FOR AND THE KILLINGS WERE 60% OF THOSE REALIGNMENT DOLLARS ARE BEING REDIRECTED THE UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT THAT 40% WOULD REMAIN UNCHANGED WITH THE JURISDICTIONS AND BUY IT AND AND WOULD BE A STABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR A RESIDUAL AN INSURED RESPONSIBILITIES AND FOR OUR PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES. AND LET ME JUST PAINT A PICTURE OF SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE EXPERIENCING ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH SIDE. AND CALIFORNIA HAS SEEN A HISTORIC INCREASE IN THE RATE OF STDS OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS -- WE'RE EXPERIENCING MORE DEVASTATING FIRES AND AN UPTICK IN HOMELESSNESS WHICH BOTH CONTRIBUTE TO AN INCREASED RISK OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE -- AND WE'RE ALSO SEEING DISEASES THAT WE THOUGHT WERE FOR CALIFORNIANS ARE OBESE AND 46% OF CALIFORNIANS ARE PRE DIABETIC THIS LOSS OF ADDITIONAL HEALTH REALIGNMENT DOLLARS IS REALLY GOING TO CRIPPLE OUR ABILITY AS LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ALSO ASSUMES THAT ALL COUNTIES WILL CONTINUE OUR WILL EXPERIENCE EVENINGS AND WHEN THIS POPULATION HAS MOVED INTO BEING ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL BUT IT DOESN'T ACKNOWLEDGE THE VARIOUS WAYS IN WHICH COUNTIES HAVE FILLED THEIR INDIGENT CARE RESPONSIBILITIES. AND IT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND PUBLIC CHARGE THE FEDERAL THREATS THAT REMAIN TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN THE CONTINUE NEED TO ENSURE A VIABLE SAFETY NET. WE LOOK FOR TING GAUGING WHAT THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION I'M AROUND THESE ISSUES AND WE JUST ASK THAT YOU AND CONTINUE JUST TO THINK ABOUT HOW FUNDAMENTAL NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT IS TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. BOTH TO OUR OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE INDIGENT CARE SERVICES BUT ALSO TO OUR OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES AND AND WE THINK THAT THIS IS A TIME WHERE GREATER INVESTMENTS INTO PUBLIC HEALTH IS NEEDED. AND SO THIS PROPOSAL JUST GIVES US PAUSE BECAUSE OF THOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH QUESTIONS COLLEAGUES [inaudible] DOCTOR PAN -- I'VE APPRECIATED THE THE PRESENTATION REGARDING PUBLIC HEALTH -- ARE HEALTH CAMILLE BE LOOKING AT PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE LACK THERE OF AND I KNOW THAT -- WELL THAT BASICALLY IN RECESSION MANY COUNTIES CUT BACK THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS -- WE'VE MADE SOME I GUESS IT JUST MEANS TO REALIGNMENT THAT -- PRIME MEANS FEWER DOLLARS ARE. TRICKLING DOWN TO PUBLIC HEALTH SAME TIME -- WELL I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN EACH YEAR I IT SEEMS LIKE WE ALWAYS KIND OF WONDER TO OUTBREAKS OF SOMETHING. AND THEN WE HAVE THE ON GOING -- ISSUE FOR EXAMPLE I GUESS DUTIES THE FACT THAT WE HAVE BABIES BORN WITH SYPHILIS. IN TODAY'S SOCIETY IN CALIFORNIA I MEAN. SOMETHING'S GONE VERY WRONG. SO -- SO WE SINCE WE SHOULD CERTAINLY LOOK AT THAT AND SEE WHAT WE'RE DOING TO STRENGTHEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND STRUCTURE -- NOT THAT I WANT TO OPEN UP NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT -- BUT WE SHOULD LOOK AT HOW THOSE DOLLARS SLOW INTERPLAY HAPPENS BETWEEN -- BETWEEN COUNTY AND AND AND AND AND MEDI CAL. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. FOR MORE LOT FALL BY THIRTY BELL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IBM. COMING FROM COUNTY LAND -- APPRECIATE -- MISGIVINGS YOU'RE. AT LEAST GIVING -- YOUR YOUR POSITIONS -- REALIGNMENT IT'S BEEN A KIND OF AN AWKWARD. STRATEGY FOR COUNTIES AB ONE AND I BEING THE MOST RECENT WHICH YOU KNOW YOU GIVE US ALL THE WORK AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND THEN YOU SAY YOU'LL FIND IT BUT THE FUNDING HAS ALWAYS BEEN -- BELOW WHAT THE ACTUAL COSTS HAVE BEEN SO IT'S BEEN ROLLED REAL DIFFICULT ESPECIALLY WITH AB ONE I WITH THE HEALTH CARE OF THE OF THE INMATES ARE COMING TO OUR COUNTY SO WE'RE PAYING SOME PRETTY SERIOUS. HEALTH CARE COST SO I'M JUST THE CURIOUS ABOUT -- THIS REVERSE REALIGNMENT IDEA IT WAS SORT OF IT WHEN I WHEN I WAS REVIEWING THE MATERIAL I WAS I THOUGHT THIS IS THIS IS UNIQUE OUT ARE WE HOW DO WE DO THAT SO. THANK YOU FOR DRAW -- YOU MADE A COMMENT ABOUT DISEASES THOUGHT OR EDUCATED OR SHOWING INCREASES COULD YOU. EXPAND ON THAT. SURE I THINK AND WE'RE SEEING THINGS LIKE TYPHUS WERE SEEING YOU KNOW. OTHER THIRD OF MEASLES I THINK EVERY DAY THERE'S A NEW THREAT TO PUBLIC HEALTH IT'S THAT'S COMING OUT IN THE THIS IS NOT -- THEY'RE NOT UNCOMMON AS THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE TO REPORT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND I BELIEVE THEY'LL PUBLISH THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN REPORT. THERE ARE THERE ARE A TONS OF DISEASES THAT ARE AROUND THAT pGRAPPLING WITH AND WE DO A LEVEL OF INVESTIGATION I'M IN CONTACT TRACING AND SO FORTH. AND THEN WE ALSO TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT THE SPREAD -- AND THEN I I ALSO WOULD WANT TO HIGHLIGHT NOT THAT IT'S DISEASES THAT WE THOUGHT WERE ONCE A RADIC HEATED BUT EVEN THINGS LIKE A NARROW OUTBREAK. I THINK WE FAIL TO THINK ABOUT HOW OLD THESE THINGS CAN IMPACT AT PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THE ELDERLY AND CHILDREN AND SO FORTH. AND I AM I PAINTED THE PICTURE OF HOW WILD FIRES IN THE INCREASE OF THAT REALLY CRIPPLES OR PUTS ADDITIONAL PRESSURES ON A PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. AND I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE LEARNED ABOUT THE WILDFIRE EXPERIENCE IN BICU COUNTY WHERE THERE WERE THREE OUTBREAKS OF NARAL BUYERS HAPPENING AND HOW OUR PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT% BOTH AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND AT THE STATE LEVEL HAD TO BRING IN ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO TRY TO ADDRESS. TO ISOLATE AND PARTICULARLY IN A SETTING WHERE IT YOU KNOW IT'S A CONGREGATE CARE SETTING AND YOU'RE NOT AND YOU KNOW INDIVIDUAL HOMES AND AND THINGS OF THAT MATTER SO WE WILL CONSTANTLY CONTINUOUSLY HAVE PRESSURES FOR PUBLIC HEALTH I THINK OUR FLU SEASON HAS. VARIOUS RAMP UPS AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'S STARTING TO GET A LOT WORSE RIGHT NOW -- AND SO THERE WILL ALWAYS BE IN A NEW THREAT TO PUBLIC HEALTH. THANK YOU THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU THIRTY BILL. I'M INTERESTED IN THE REACTION FROM OUR OUR REPRESENTATIVES -- READ COMMENTS ON HOW THAT WOULD -- AFFECT. IN THE ATTEMPTS THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA TO ADD. OF INSURANCE PROGRAMS MEDICARE ALL. TO UNDOCUMENTED AND ALSO. OF THE WHOLE [inaudible] CASH. PAYMENT SYSTEM FOR IMMIGRANTS. IN TERMS OF PAYING CASH HOW THAT BECOMES A EXPLOITIVE MEDICAL SYSTEM. IF YOU COULD COMMENT ON THAT PLEASE I'D APPRECIATE OR AND THANK YOU FOR BRING UP THE COMMON A PUBLIC CHARGE -- I THINK THAT WHAT WE HAVE SEEN ANECDOTALLY AND A LOT OF OUR COMMUNITIES IS THAT. THE CONSTANT -- A STRESS THAT THEY'RE NOW FACING AND TRAUMA NOT ONLY FROM PUBLIC CHARGER PROPOSALS THAT -- GENERALLY PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND AT THIS TIME -- IN IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES BUT ALSO FROM THINGS LIKE ICE RAIDS AND FAMILY -- DETENTIONS AND DEPORTATIONS AND SEPARATIONS -- THERE'S A GENERAL SENTIMENT AROUND FEAR AND SO WITH THAT I RELATION OF PUBLIC CHARGE ON BECAUSE THERE IS NO FINAL PROPOSED RULE WE CAN'T NECESSARILY SAY WHAT WILL BE AFFECTED WHAT WILL NOT BE AFFECTED -- AND AS WAS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED -- MANY UNDOCUMENTED RESIDENTS MAY NOT EVEN BE AFFECTED BUT JUST BECAUSE THAT THERE IS THE FEAR AND CONFUSION -- ANECDOTALLY RIGHT NOW WE ARE ALREADY SEEING AN UPTICK IN DESCEND ROLE MEANT -- BUT WE DO EXPECT THAT THEY WOULD HAVE. QUITE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT IS BECAUSE A LOT OF FAMILIES ARE MAKE STATUS FAMILIES AND ALSO -- SOMEBODY AT ASTUTELY MENTIONED THAT IF ONE PERSON -- DOESN'T GET HEALTH INSURANCE OR CAN'T GET IT. FOR ONE PERSON FEELS AFRAID BECAUSE THE PUBLIC CHARGE THE ENTIRE FAMILY IS LIKELY TO STAY AWAY FROM THAT BENEFIT -- TO THE CASH IS THAT THE CASH -- I'M ISSUE -- WE'RE HAPPY TO GET MORE INFORMATION TO THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE -- I DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFICS -- BUT YEAH BY I CAN I STE INCENTIVIZING -- THESE SYSTEMS THAT ARE OFFICIAL -- BECAUSE THERE IS NO COVERAGE FOR MEDI CAL FOR UNDOCUMENTED RESIDENTS OF THE DO YOU HAVE TO FIND PIECEMEAL WAYS TO FIND CARE. OR AGAIN LIKE I SAID A JUST RESULT IN PERMANENT DISABILITY OR DEATH IF THAT PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED DO THINK DO YOU THINK THAT -- THE THE WHOLE PUBLIC CHARGE AND IF WE GO IN AND WE SAY WELL WE'RE GOING TO COVER ALL THESE ADDED. PEOPLE YOU THINK WE HAVE TO HAVE A COMMUNITY OUT REACH -- TO SIGN PEOPLE UP. DO YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE ON THAT FOR US ABSENT IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO THAT IN. A WAY WHERE WE HAVE PEOPLE WITH FEARS AND AB HOW DO WE GO ABOUT DOING THAT WHAT WOULD YOUR ADVICE BE I THINK THAT WE ARE THE OTHERS. TO YEAH ABSOLUTELY I THINK WE GOT WE LEARNED A LESSON FROM THE ACA THAT IT DID REQUIRE A LOT OF OUR REGION EDUCATION TO REACH PEOPLE I MEAN ESPECIALLY IN IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES WHERE -- SOME POPULATIONS MAY ALREADY BE I'M DISTRUSTFUL OF INSTITUTIONS IT DOES REQUIRE -- A LOT OF OUR REGION EDUCATION AND SO WHEN IT COMES TO AND ROMAN PEAS -- I THINK WHAT WITH OUR DECADES OF EXPERIENCE OF WORKING WITH AN IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES -- WE SEE THAT WE NEED TIME AND PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS I'M TO REACH PEOPLE WHERE THEY'RE OUT TO AND WHERE THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH PEOPLE WHO SPEAK THEIR OWN LANGUAGE. IF I MY MENTOR BETH BELL HEALTHAXIS AGAIN WE AND OFFICIALS IN THIS INCOME LEVEL OR ALREADY AND ROLLED IN RESTRICTED SCOPE COVERAGE. AND SO WE ALREADY HAVE A CONNECTION WITH SOME THE EXPERIENCE WITH CHILDREN WHICH WAS IN A HAPPIER TIME WHEN THE WASN'T PUBLIC CHARGE ON THE HORIZON. WAS THAT WE SAID. HELLO YOU KNOW ON THE SOME SUCH DAY YOU'RE GOING TO GO FROM EMERGENCY ONLY COVERAGE COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE. AND PEOPLE WERE MOSTLY HAPPY ABOUT THAT -- WE WOULD IT THIS IS SOMETHING WHETHER IT'S THE LOW INCOME HEALTH PROGRAM THE YOU'LL RECALL FROM THE PRE ACA WE'VE ACTUALLY GOTTEN PRETTY GOOD AT MOVING POPULATIONS FROM LIMITED. COVERAGE. TO FULL CUP COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE AND SO WE WOULD HOPE BUT IT HAS TO GO HAND IN HAND WITH EXPLAINING. WHAT IT IS THAT'S GOING ON SO THAT FOLKS NOW AND THAT THE DEPARTMENT SPOKE TO THAT AND WE WOULD HOPE THAT ARE -- FOUNDATION PARTNERS WHO HAVE BEEN SO COMMITTED TO SUFFER WOULD ALSO COULD CONTINUE TO BE COMMENDED AS WELL. THANK YOU TO THE PANEL FOR BRINGING INTO THE CONVERSATION REAL LIFE EXAMPLES IN REAL LIFE HEALTH CRISISTO REALLY HELP FRAME THE CONVERSATION WE'RE HAVING WE APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. WE'RE GOING TO HOLD PUBLIC COMMENT TO THE END OF THE-HEARING. WE'RE GONNA TRANSITION NOW TO PART BE OF THE HEARING THE GOVERNOR'S PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROPOSALS. THE FIRST PANEL -- WILL FOCUS ON THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ON BULK PURCHASING. AND WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM MATT BENDER OUR LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS MANAGER DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES CLINT CALLUM ASSISTANCE PROGRAM BUDGET MANAGER DEPARTMENT FINANCE. AND OF COURSE MISTER JOHNSON FROM THE LA JOH. COLLEAGUES FOLLOW THIS PANEL WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE SECOND PANEL ON THE TRANSITION FROM -- MEDI CAL PHARMACY THE FEE FOR SERVICE AND THEY WILL GOING TO HAVE A STAKEHOLDERS PANEL -- WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM. S. CI YOU [inaudible] HEALTH ACCESS. OF THE INLAND EMPIRE HEALTH PLANS CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION PHARMA. THE CALIFORNIA PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION JUST TO GIVE YOU A HEADLINE ON WHAT'S COMING NEXT. MR BENDER WELCOME AND THANK YOU -- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND A ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY TO ALL OF YOU FROM DG US. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ALL RIGHT -- IT THE MAP UNDER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES -- HERE TALK ABOUT OUR PIECE OF THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER -- WE START OUT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POSE AN INTERESTING QUESTION -- AND THE QUESTION IS IS THERE ANY ABILITY. TO NEGOTIATE FOR LOWER PRICES ON SOLE SOURCE DRUGS THAT DON'T HAVE A GENERIC EQUIVALENT WITHOUT TURNING INTO A BINARY CHOICE WHERE OF NEGOTIATIONS BREAK DOWN THE DRUG JUST ISN'T COVERED AT ALL -- AND THE ANSWER IS YES THERE ARE WAYS TO LEVERAGE THE STATE SPEND WITHOUT TURNING IT INTO THAT KIND OF A BINARY CHOICE IN TGS -- DOES THAT CURRENTLY FOR A STATE AGENCY CUSTOMERS -- GOT NEGOTIATED PRICING AGREEMENTS FOR NINETEEN PRIORITY MEDICATIONS WITHOUT NEEDING. TO ELIMINATE ACCESS TO OTHER MEDICATIONS AND WE'VE DONE THIS BY OFFERING PREFERENTIAL PLACEMENT ON A FORMULARY. THAT DOESN'T PROHIBIT THE USE OF JERRY -- BUT BEFORE I GET INTO EXACTLY HOW WE DO IT I I NEED TO CLARIFY WHAT EXACTLY WE DO A TGS WITH RESPECT TO PRESCRIPTION DRUGS -- DDS HAS TWO DISTINCT ROLES IN ITS SUPPORT TO DRAW A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THEM -- THE FIRST ROLE WHICH IS THE GS AS TRADITIONAL ROLE IS TO BUY PHARMACEUTICALS. FOR STATE AGENCIES THAT DON'T HAVE THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT DRUG PURCHASING PROGRAMS -- THAT'S WHAT WE CALL THE STATE WIDE PHARMACEUTICAL PROGRAM -- THE CORE CUSTOMERS HERE OR CDC ARE OF THE DEPARTMENT STATE HOSPITALS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. THOSE ARE -- THOSE ARE CALLED OUT IN STATUTE AS OUR CORE CUSTOMERS IN ADDITION -- WE ALSO BY FOR THE CHP THE CSU SYSTEM AND SOME CD PH PROGRAMS -- LOCAL AGENCIES CAN ALSO USE OUR CONTRACTS AND ACTUALLY WE HAVE THREE OF THEM CURRENTLY OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY JAIL WHICH WAS ALREADY MENTIONED -- SACRAMENTO COUNTY JAIL IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY -- AND WERE ACTIVELY WERE WORKING TO RECRUIT MORE -- INCLUDING THROUGH MS GIVENS ORGANIZATION PRESENTING TO THEM AND PRESENTED TO OTHER AGENTS OTHER GROUPS THAT REPRESENT -- COUNTIES ANOTHER LOCAL. ALL OF OUR MAJOR CUSTOMERS ARE PURCHASERS TO TAKE PHYSICAL POSSESSION OF THE DRUGS AND DISPENSED THEM TO THEIR POPULATIONS. THAT'S DISTINCT FROM A PAY YEAR RULE WHERE -- WHERE IS THE PAYER IS ESSENTIALLY REIMBURSING FOR THE DISPENSATION OF A DRUG AT A RETAIL PHARMACY WE DO A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF THAT BUT OVERWHELMINGLY OUR CUSTOMERS ARE PURCHASERS -- THERE WERE THERE ALSO SOME MAJOR AGENCIES THAT DON'T PURCHASE THEIR DRUGS RUDY DJIA'S OF MEDI CAL PERS AND THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA ARE THE BIGGEST ONES. IN THAT KIND OF LEADS TO TGS IS SECOND ROLE -- WHICH IS AS THE FACILITATOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA OF PHARMACEUTICAL COLLABORATIVE -- THIS IS AN INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP THAT BRINGS TOGETHER THE MAJOR STATE TRUCK PURCHASING PROGRAMS US LOCAL AGENCY REPRESENTATIVES -- SOME REGULATORY AGENCIES AD OTHER POLICY MAKERS -- ALL OF WHOM HAVE AN INTEREST IN A PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES -- THE GOAL IS TO CONTROL PHARMACEUTICAL RELATED SPEND FOR A CD CPC MEMBERS. WE HAVE THREE BASIC FOCUSES -- THE FIRST A PROCUREMENT WHICH IS TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES AND PARTNERSHIPS. FOR JOINT SOLICITATIONS AND PRICING AGREEMENTS THAT -- AS WELL AS CONTRACT PULLMAN EXECUTION -- SECONDS POLICY -- DEVELOPING POLICY PROPOSALS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR LEGISLATIVE CHANGE -- AND THE THIRD IS PARTICIPATION OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES -- THE BILL TO SHARE INFORMATION AND IDEALLY TO SURE PURCHASING POWER -- THE CURRENT FORM OF THE CPC DATES TO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IT'S THE SUCCESSOR TO PREVIOUS GROUPS DATING BACK TO TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THAT WERE ORIGINALLY SET UP. TO FACILITATE INFORMATION SHARING BETWEEN TGS PURRS AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IN RESPONSE. TO TWO THOUSAND FIVE LEGISLATION -- SUGGESTING THAT -- OVER THE YEARS THE ROLE IN MEMBERSHIP HAS EXPANDED -- REFLECTING THE ADMINISTRATION'S INTEREST IN -- PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS -- TGS HAS ALSO RECENTLY BEEN STEPPING UP TO SUPPORT THE COLLABORATIVE ON MORE OF IT WITH YOU KNOW DEDICATED STAFF RATHER THAN AS A COLLATERAL DUTY FOR OUR DRUG PURCHASING STAFF -- THE BASICS DESK CALIFORNIA PHARMACEUTICAL COLLABORATIVE -- THE BROADER WORK GROUP -- LET ME BRING IT BACK TO THE STATEWIDE PHARMACEUTICAL PROGRAM WHICH IS OUR CORE PURCHASING OPERATION AT TGS OFFERED CCR DS HDS IN THE OTHER AGENCIES -- THE BASIC STRATEGIES WE USED TO GET LOWER PRICES FOR CUSTOMERS IS A MIX OF VOLUME PURCHASING AND PREFERENTIAL PHARMACY PLAY OUR PREFERENTIAL FORMULAR REPLACEMENT -- WE HAVE A FEW DIFFERENT CONTRACTING APPROACHES -- WE USE DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS WITH MANUFACTURERS WE USE -- WHOLE PHARMACEUTICAL WHOLESALER. THAT CAN PROVIDE AS VOLUME PRICING -- WE ALSO USE A GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATION -- TO SECURE DISCOUNTS ON OTHER DRUGS PART -- THREE BIGGEST CUSTOMERS CBC RDS AGENT EDS HISTORICALLY OUR BIGGEST CUSTOMERS -- HAVE USED A COMMON DRUG FORMULARY CREATIVELY CALL THE COMMON DRUG FORMULARY -- THAT WAS STARTED IN -- TWO THOUSAND ONE IT'S BEEN KEPT UP TO DATE SINCE THEN WITH A A MINOR WRINKLE TO THE CDC ARE RECEIVERSHIP. IT'S TECHNICALLY A SEPARATE FORMULAR BUT WE TRY TO KEEP THEM AS CLOSELY ALIGNED AS POSSIBLE -- ON THE COMMITTEES QUESTION ABOUT -- HOW WE APPROACH -- SOLE SOURCE DRUGS WITH NO GENERIC ALTERNATIVE -- GENERALLY WE'VE ACHIEVED GOOD RESULTS BY WORKING WITH OUR COMMON DRUG FORMULARY COMMITTEE ON ISSUES RELATED FORMULA REPLACEMENT -- OUR NEGOTIATING POWER DEPENDS IN SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR ABILITY TO CHANNEL THE STATE SPEND -- TOWARD PARTICULAR MEDICATIONS -- WHEN WE OF MULTIPLE DRUGS IN THE SAME THERAPEUTIC CLASS -- US SIM SAME INDICATIONS SIMILAR EFFECTIVENESS WE'VE HAD SUCCESS IN OBTAINING DISCOUNTS -- IN EXCHANGE FOR MORE FAVORABLE FORMULAR REPLACEMENT. BECAUSE IF YOU SAY HAVE FIVE ON PATENT DRUGS THAT TREAT THE SAME CONDITIONS SIMILAR EFFECTIVENESS INDICATIONS -- WE CAN PICK. ONE UP PARDON ME. WE CAN PICK ONE IS THE SORT OF THE DEFAULT FIRST LINE THERAPY -- AND COST CAN BE A FACTOR IN THAT -- WE CAN ALSO STILL BY THE OTHER MORE EXPENSIVE DRUGS -- AS SECOND LINE THERAPIES WERE FOR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS WHERE OUR FIRST LINE DRUG ISN'T A DICK INDICATED FOR WHATEVER REASON -- BUT OUR ABILITY TO CHANNEL SPEND TOWARD A PARTICULAR DRUG DOES GIVE US -- SOMETHING MEANINGFUL TO OFFER MANUFACTURERS IN EXCHANGE FOR DISCOUNTS -- OBVIOUSLY THIS APPROACH REQUIRES A LOT OF CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH CLINICIANS TO REVIEW THE DRUGS ARE THERAPEUTIC CLASS. EVALUATE ROLE TO THE FACT IN THIS DETERMINE WHAT KIND OF FORMULA REPLACEMENT AND UTILIZATION TROLLS ARE GOOD WITH. ARE CONSISTENT WITH GOOD -- MEDICAL PRACTICE -- WE WORK CLOSELY WITH COMMON DRUG FORMULARY COMMITTEE WHICH REPRESENTS OUR CORE AGENCIES. A BROADER PURCHASING PROGRAM WOULD LIKELY BRING IN -- BROADER CONSULTATION WITH PARTICIPATING AGENCIES -- BUT AS THE ON THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE POST WE DO HAVE OPTIONS -- IN MANY CASES WHERE THERE'S A SOLE SOURCE BROKEN NO GENERIC ALTERNATIVE -- I AT THIS POINT IN. EARLY EXECUTION OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO RULE ANYTHING OUT BUT THERE ARE DEFINITELY. OPTIONS THAT WE CAN PURSUE -- WITH THAT -- LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO CLINT FOR ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO ADD. CLINT COUNT APARTMENT FINANCE -- NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD HERE TO ANSWERING QUESTIONS. NOT HAVE BEEN JOHNSON WITH THE LA -- WE'RE CONTINUING TO ANALYZE THIS PROPOSAL AS THE ADMINISTRATION IS AND WE THINK ULTIMATELY A LOT IS GOING TO DEPEND ON ONE THE FUTURE FINDINGS -- OF FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON IN OF THEIR EXISTING PRACTICES AND THE AND POTENTIAL STRATEGIES FOR GOING FORWARD. WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE POTENTIAL FOR SCALING -- EXISTING PRACTICES IS LIKELY GOING TO HAVE A MAJOR EFFECT ON ITS POTENTIAL TO ALTERNATELY PRODUCE FUTURE FUTURE SAVINGS -- AT FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT CURRENTLY SAY -- DG HASSLE NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF A FEW HUNDRED THOUSAND LIVES MAY BE -- WHEREAS OTHER NEGOTIATORS MILLIONS OF LIVES UPON WHICH THEY ARE NEGOTIATING PRICES OVER SO THE THE POTENTIAL IN THE GOV UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER TO BRING IN PRIVATE IF THEY ULTIMATELY CHOOSE. TO COULD REALLY BE A A BOOST FOR THE STATE BUT ULTIMATELY WILL DEPEND ON THEIR FUTURE DESIRE TO DO SO SO BUT THIS IS SOMETHING WE CONTINUE TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND BETTER. MUCH QUESTIONS SENATOR MONEY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- THANK YOU FOR THIS THE OVERVIEW. IN. MAYBE A SHOW MY IGNORANCE BUT I GET THE IDEA OF USING. OUR BUYING POWER TO COVER. THOUSANDS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS. BUT FROM A PHYSICIAN PERSPECTIVE OFTEN. ONE DRUG THAT MIGHT WORK FOR PATIENT AMY DOES NOT WORK FOR PATIENT BE. SO HOW WHAT'S THE FLEXIBILITY THE PRESCRIBING PHYSICIAN WHEN THE STATE. IS USING ITS LEVERAGE TO PURCHASE MASSIVE QUANTITIES OF DRUG AIMED AT THAT THE PHYSICIAN CONSIDERS FOR THIS PATIENT WE NEED TO TRY DRUGS BEING MAYBE DRUG SCENE. HOW DOES THAT? FLEXIBILITY IN PRESCRIBING. PLAY INTO THE MASS PURCHASING. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION -- AS I INDICATED ARE ARE EXISTING COMMON DRUG FOR MILLER THAT WE USE FOR THE STATE INSTITUTIONS. DOESN'T YOU KNOW DOESN'T RULE OUT THE USE OF ANY DRUG -- PER SE -- WE THE UNITED SOME THERAPEUTIC CLASSES WE A ONE DRUG THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED AS YOU KNOW HAVING PREFERENTIAL PLATE PLACEMENT. AND SO THEIR UTILIZATION CONTROLS AND OTHER DRUGS THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T USE IT -- BUT TYPICALLY THERE'S AN AUTHORIZATION PROCESS IS REQUIRED TO USE IT -- THIS IS YOU KNOW NOT RADICALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION PROCESS THAT WE EXPERIENCE WITH OUR OWN HEALTH CARE -- SO THERE IS THERE IS OPPORTUNITY TO ALLOW FOR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS WHERE -- YOU KNOW. 80% OF THE TIME THE DRUGS ARE THE SAME BUT FOR THIS 20% OF THE POPULATION DRUG AXES REALLY YOU'RE BETTER PAT -- EVEN IF IF OVER TIME YOU LEARN THAT. AS MANY AS 20%. WON'T BENEFIT FROM DRUG A CAN CAN DRUG BE BE PART OF THAT PURCHASING. STRATEGY WHEN YOU KNOW. NON IN SOME OF THESE INSTITUTIONS THEY'RE GONNA NEED TO ACCESS THAT VERSES THE DELAY OF OF HAVING. TO GO THROUGH WHATEVER THE BUREAUCRATIC PROCESSES OF GETTING THAT AUTHORIZATION -- WE DEFINITELY CAN WE DEFINITELY CAN PURSUE MORE THAN ONE DRUG IN A THERAPEUTIC CLASS -- AND TRY AND TRY OUR BEST. TO TO OFFER THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHANNEL SPEND TOWARD THE MANUFACTURERS AND US SEE WHAT THEY'RE WILLING TO GIVE US. BEGIN IN JUST LOOKING IN ECONOMIES OF SCALE. SO CANADA HAS AMONG -- THE LEAST EXPENSIVE. DRUG PRICES IN THEY HAVE ABOUT A SIMILAR POPULATION TO THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- YOU'RE BUYING ON BEHALF OF STATE ENTITIES COVERING STATE COVERED PATIENTS -- HEY IS THERE ANY PROHIBITION TO CALIFORNIA. COMBINING WITH OTHER STATES TO FURTHER MAXIMIZE OUR LEVERAGE IN THAT MARKET TO SET REYES ANTI TRUST ISSUES OR COULD WE PARTNER WITH OREGON AND WASHINGTON FOR EXAMPLE. TO HAVE EVEN A STRONGER -- LEVERAGE IN THAT MARKET THAT THE PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCER ANY. THEY WANT THE CANADA ACCOUNT NOW THEY WANT THE NOT JUST CALIFORNIA BUT A COMBINED -- STATE THE GROUP OF EMPIRES OF THAT SO THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION IT'S AND IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT AND INNER CONSIDERING -- ACTUALLY. PRICE YOU MENTIONED OREGON WASHINGTON WHICH WERE THE ONE THE THE THE THOSE STATES HAVE EXPRESSED YOU KNOW GENERAL INTEREST. IN -- PRESCRIPTION DRUG PURCHASING AS WELL OBVIOUSLY CALIFORNIA'S MUCH BIGGER STATE THAN THOSE TWO STATES -- SO THAT THERE MAY BE YOU KNOW FRANKLY THE OTHER STATES MAY BENEFIT MORE THAN CALIFORNIA. BUT YES THERE ARE POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO JOINING WITH OTHER STATES -- IF WE CAN IF WE CAN MAKE IT ALL WORK. WHEN I HESITATE TO SAY ME WE SHOULD EXPLORE WORKING WITH TEXAS TOO BUT THAT MAY BE A NON STARTER CAM? THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THINKING. THANK VENTURE FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE -- SAFETY NET CLINICS IN SAFETY NET HOSPITALS COUNTY HOSPITALS WHO -- HAVE COME TO RELY ON THREE FORTY B. WAIVER -- AND THE DISCOUNTS -- TO STRETCH RESOURCES AND KEEP THE DOORS OPEN -- DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT THIS PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROPOSAL WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THOSE ENTITIES AND HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO MITIGATE THAT. TO A TWO PARTER. OKAY -- THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE TWO PART QUESTION -- I THINK. I DON'T HAVE -- COMPLETE ANSWER FOR THAT -- OBVIOUSLY. THE EXTENT THE EXACTLY WHO IS GOING TO BE PURCHASING THROUGH THE BULK PURCHASING PROGRAM. OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD LIKE IT TO BE EVERYONE BUT THERE ARE PARTICULAR IS WITH. DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND PRIVATE PURCHASERS -- EACH ONE HAS ITS OWN SORT OF LEGAL FRAMEWORK -- LEGAL ISSUES -- OTHER PRESS OTHER PROGRAM PRICING THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE TO THEM SO. I THINK THE SHORT ANSWER IS THAT IF WE'RE WORKING WITH SAFETY NET CLINICS. WE'RE GOING TO WORK TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY GET UNDER THREE FORTY BE -- WHETHER WE CAN WHETHER WE CAN DO SOMETHING FOR THEM THAT IS BENEFICIAL TO THEM RELATIVE TO THREE FORTY BE. AND WHAT KIND OF LEGAL OBSTACLES THERE ARE IF ANY TO THEIR PARTICIPATION WILL IT SEEMS TO ME IT'S JUST MOVING MONEY AROUND ISN'T IT SO. YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE DELTA IS AND THEY'RE EITHER GOING TO MAKE UP THE DELTA THROUGH THE THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM OR THE STATE'S GOING TO HAVE TO COME BACK IN. IF YOU VALUE THE CONCEPT OF SO AND AND AND MAKE IT UP I'M JUST ASKING THAT YOU TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION. CAN WE WE NOT HAVE A DELTA. THAT STATES NOT IT'S ON ADDRESSED AT THE END OF THIS PROCESS WE WE DEFINITELY CAN TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION WHATEVER WERE. TALKING WITH SOMEONE ABOUT BRINGING THEM INTO THE PROGRAM THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. FORGIVE ME IF I MISSED IT -- WHEN I HAD TO STEP AWAY FROM THE DANCE FOR A QUICK SECOND -- BUT THE EXECUTIVE ORDER COULD INCLUDE A PRETTY AGGRESSIVE TIMELINE FOR KIND OF ROLLING OUT THE BULK PURCHASING PROGRAM -- WHAT'S THE STATUS ON IMPLEMENTATION ARE YOU CAN IN YOUR MILESTONES -- ELSE PLANNED. IT ALSO TALKS ABOUT PROVIDING REPORT TO MORE CURIOUS AS TO WHETHER ANY THOSE REPORTS ON YOUR STATUS WILL BE MADE PUBLIC. ALL RIGHT -- LET ME -- LET ME FIRST ADDRESS STATUS -- WE HAVE -- COLLECTED DATA FROM ALL OF THE STATE MEMBERS. OF THE OF THE CPC THEY WERE ASKED TO IDENTIFY THEIR TOP FIFTY OVERALL SPEND DRUGS TO US -- WE RECEIVE THAT DATA WERE STILL US OF COLLECTING DATA FROM THE LOCAL SOME OF THAT IS STILL TRICKLING IN. BUT WE'RE ALREADY LOOKING AT THE DATA -- Là LOOKING AT PRIORITIZATION CRITERIA -- FRANKLY THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF WORK GOING ON IN PARALLEL BECAUSE OF THE AGGRESSIVE TIME ONCE YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT. BUT THE REPORT TO THE GOVERNOR -- THE FIRST FOUR TO THE GOVERNOR'S -- TO MARCH FIFTEENTH AND SO FAR SO GOOD IN TERMS OF STAYING ON SCHEDULE FOR THE OUT AND WE'LL THE BILL'S REPORT BE MADE PUBLIC. I THINK -- INITIALLY THEIR INTENDED TO BE FOR THE GOVERNOR'S DELIBERATION -- AND I DON'T KNOW THE LONG TERM PROSPECTS OF RELEASING THE PORTS REPORTS HOWEVER I WOULD SAY THAT NATURALLY WHATEVER DECISIONS COME OUT OF THE REPORTS. AND THOSE DISCUSSIONS WILL PROBABLY INCLUDE WHAT DATA WAS USE WHAT OPTIONS WERE CONSIDERED I MEAN I THINK THAT WOULD BE A LOT OF WHAT'S IN THE REPORT NOW WHETHER IN FACT THAT EXACT REPORT IS RELEASED I DON'T KNOW TURNER. I THINK WHAT MOST OF US ARE CONCERNED ABOUT AS ELECTED OFFICIALS WHAT I ASSUME IS REALLY DRIVING -- THE GOVERNOR AND FOR THAT MATTER THE THE PRESIDENT'S INTEREST IN A TO BE TO CONTROL THE COST OF PHARMACEUTICALS IS REALLY MAKING SURE THE CONSUMERS -- EXPERIENCE A SAVINGS THE BOOKS AND SO THAT THAT THEY BENEFIT FROM THE LOWER CLASS. SO. I'M CURIOUS AS TO TO WHETHER OR NOT -- YOU CAN GUARANTEE THAT THAT WILL BE THE EXPERIENCE PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE GOING TO ALLOW PRIVATE PAYERS TO BENEFIT. FROM THE STATE'S PURCHASING POWER. THAT'S A THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION -- OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE A LOT OF COMPLICATED ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE WORKED OUT -- WITH THE PRIVATE PAYER PARTICIPATION I THINK ARE PER YOU KNOW. THE THE WHOLE IDEA OF HAVING POTENTIAL PRIVATE PURCHASER PARTICIPATION IS TO GIVE THEM TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE TO PARTICIPATE IN A BIGGER POOL. THEN WOULD OTHERWISE BE THE CASE -- WERE YOU KNOW THE THE POINT IS TO GET LOWER A PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES. FOR ALL THE PARTICIPANTS -- THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SHOOTING FOR AND WE AND THAT'S WHAT WE EXPECT WOULD HAPPEN. IT'S OUR EXPECTATION BUT WE THERE'S NO. AS THE COMMERCIAL SAYS GARY AUNTIE. IF AYE AYE THERE ARE WERE ALL WERE WERE WERE A MONTH IF IT WERE A MONTH AND TO IMPLEMENT MANNING THE EXECUTIVE ORDER AND I YOU KNOW. I THINK THE WHOLE POINT. IS TO OBTAIN LOWER PRICES GET TO A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE MAKING A DECISION WHERE WHERE. ESSENTIALLY IT'S THE DECISION IS TO DO SOMETHING THAT MOVES FORWARD BUT GOES IN THE WRONG DIRECTION IN TERMS OF GETTING LOWER PRICES. I THINK WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO TAKE THE OTHER APPROACH -- WITH YOU KNOW OUR FOCUS OBVIOUSLY WE'RE LOOKING AT THE AT THE AT THE AGGRESSIVE TIMELINE TO DELIVERABLES IN THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. BOTH ULTIMATELY WERE TRYING TO MAKE THIS A BENEFIT FOR THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA AND THINGS THAT ARE TO BENEFIT FRUIT PEOPLE CALIFORNIA -- NOT THINGS THAT WE WANT TO DO. GOOD TO HEAR THANK YOU FOR THAT ANY -- FINAL QUESTIONS OH MY GOODNESS. SENATOR SHOULD OWN FOLLOWED BY SENATOR MORE LOT. ANSWERED OPINION AMOUNT OF CHAIR -- I WONDER FIRST OF ALL SAY I LINE MY CONCERNS WITH US SENATE ROTH OF THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM ESPECIALLY IN SOME OF THE MORE RURAL AREAS WITH HOSPIALS THAT. HAVE -- THESE DRUG DISCOUNT PRO CLOSE THE DOORS AND WILL HAVE OTHER PROBLEMS ON OUR WATCH -- YOU MENTIONED -- AND NEGOTIATING WITH -- SIMILAR PHARMACOLOGICAL CLASSES OF DRUGS TO PUT ONE ON A FORMULARY AND AND ANSWER -- CENTER MONIES QUESTION OF PHYSICIANS CAN MAKE THE CASE FOR PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS THIS ATIENT IS ALLERGIC TO THIS BRAND NAME DRUG IN THE START WORK THE SAME WAY. AND THEREFORE THAT'S THE ONLY DRUG THAT THEY CAN BE PUT ON AN ULTIMATELY THEY THEY DO ONE THE QUESTION IS WHETHER YOU CAN NEGOTIATE WITH THEM IF THEY'RE NOT THE DRUG OF CHOICE ON ON A FORMULARY. BUT ONE AREA THAT HAS SEEN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN A YOU YOU DIDN'T ADDRESS AT AND THAT IS THE ISING COST OF GENERIC DRUGS -- THERE WE DON'T SEE THE THE DELIVERY OF NEWER DRUGS COMING ON THE MARKET LIKE WE DID IN THE EIGHTIES NINETIES -- GETTING THROUGH THE FTA AS A VERY ARDUOUS LONG COMPREHENSIVE PROCESS IT SHOULD BE BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE DRUGS ARE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE BUT A WAY THAT. DRUG COMPANIES ARE BOOSTING THEIR PROFITS IS TAKING DRUGS AT YOU KNOW ORIGINALLY AS AN EXAMPLE FOR HE'S NOW -- THEY'VE GONE UP TO IN SOME CASES -- FIVE HUNDRED TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS A THOUSAND SO YOU IT'S NOT THE INGREDIENTS HAVE GONE UP IT'S JUST THAT. THEY'VE DECIDED THAT THEY'RE GOING TO RAISE THE PRICE. SO WHAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE IS THAT WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING -- FOR PREFERRED -- DRUGS ON A FORMULARY LIST THAT YOU NEED TO LOOK AT MANUFACTURES AND GET THESE MANUFACTURERS TO COMPETE WITH ONE ANOTHER -- ALSO I THINK -- PURCHASING IN VOLUME IS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE GIVING EXCLUSIVITY TO CERTAIN FORMULARIES AND IT SOUNDS LIKE -- YOU DO SOME OF THE BIDDING FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YOU DON'T DO MUCH FOR UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA OR MEDI CAL. SO -- WHILE I HAVE NEVER BEEN AN ADVOCATE OF THE EXPANSION OF GOVERNMENT -- I'M GONNA FLOOR ON AN IDEA THAT I MENTIONED BEFORE I THINK WE SHOULD FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT PRESCRIPTION PURCHASING AN ADJUDICATION. AND WHAT I THINK THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD DO. IS GET INTO THE PBM BUSINESS AND WE SHOULD HAVE A STATE PBM. THE MAYBE CUT CONTRACT WITH WASHINGTON CONTRACT WITH OREGON DO THEIR EACH INDICATIONS AND INSTEAD OF ALLOWING THESE PRIVATE COMPANIES TO OPERATE IN A BLACK BOX. AN EXTRACT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AWAY FROM LORING PREMIUMS AND BENEFITS FOR OUR BENEFICIARIES THAT WE SHOULD BE AT THAT TABLE IT SOUNDS LIKE TO ME WHAT THE STATE IS TRYING TO DO IS RECREATE THE WHEEL THAT THE P. B. M.'S OF ALREADY. DONE -- BUT WHY SHOULD WE YOU KNOW ALLOW THEM. TO SIPHON OFF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHEN WE HAVE SO MANY IS WE HAVE A DISCUSSION TODAY ABOUT PROVIDING. CARE FOR UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE OF ALL AGES YOU KNOW TO TRY TO SAVE THE STATE MONEY BECAUSE WE WANT TO GOING TO EMERGENCY ROOMS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- IMPLEMENTING A EIGHT A PENALTY -- TO BACK FILL THE FEDERAL LACK OF A PENALTY. HAVING OUR OWN PVM ABOUT WHERE THE COST OF THE PENALTIES A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS HAVING OUR OWN PBM LADIES AND GENTLEMAN CAN RAISE NOT A BILLION BUT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR. FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO EMBARK ON A SOME OF THE GOALS AND ASPIRATIONS -- THAT WE ALL -- EITHER EMBRACE PHILOSOPHICALLY OR PARTIALLY -- SO -- I THROW THIS OUT THERE THIS IS A BIG IDEA BUT CALIFORNIA. SHOULD LOOK AT BIG IDEAS. AND AND AND NOT RECREATE THE WHEEL MY CONCERN ABOUT WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN IS IS THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE ANY OF THE FRUITS OF OUR LABORS TILL. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO YOU COULD FORMA PBM IN SIX MONTHS AND YOU CAN HAVE AN OPERATING. VERY AGGRESSIVELY -- BY NEXT YEAR. AND YOU IF YOU FORM YOUR PBM YOU'RE NOT GOING AFTER REACH OUT TO THE DRUG COMPANIES THEY'RE GOING TO REACH OUT TO YOU THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THEM LINED UP AT A TABLE. AND BELIEVE ME YOU CAN GET SOME SIGNIFICANT -- BREAKS THAT ARE ON UP WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT. HOW PBM IS TRULY OPERATE BUT WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT USED TO BE A SWITCH OF FIFTEEN CENTS AS A TRANSACTION MEDIATOR BETWEEN A PATIENT AND A? IN A AN INSURANCE COMPANY. COMPANIES LIKE EXPRESS SCRIPTS THAT HAVE A VALUE OF FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS BELIEVE ME IT'S NOT FROM GETTING FIFTEEN CENTS A TRANSACTION -- TRANSMITTING PRESCRIPTION CLAIMS SO I SAY WE OUGHT TO TAKE THAT OPPORTUNITY INVESTIGATED HAVE OUR OWN CALIFORNIA PBM HAVE OUR OWN -- DEPARTMENT THAT OVERSEES AT WHICH WILL I GUARANTEE YOU BRING AND THOUSANDS MORE THAT'S GOING TO COST US TO CREATE THIS DEPARTMENT WE GET ONLINE FASTER AND WE GIVE THE HEALTH CARE THAT OUR CITIZENS DESERVE AND NEED AT THE LOWEST COST POSSIBLE SO. I'D LIKE TO GET YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS -- THIS VOLLEY -- WHAT THAT WILL THANK THANK YOU FOR THE SUGGESTION I MEAN? WE'RE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF IMPLEMENTATION IN THERE A LOT OF DIRECTIONS THAT WE CAN GO IN -- I'M I'M GLAD THE WORK HEARING IDEAS THAT ABOUT. A POTENTIAL ULTIMATE SOLUTIONS -- I WOULD SAY. WE'RE ACUTELY AWARE THAT. IN MANY YOU KNOW IT THAT IN MANY CASES THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF VALUE THAT'S BEING CAPTURED BY THE PBM -- THAT WE DON'T REALLY WE DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW ABOUT BECAUSE THE THE PAYMENTS ARE GOING TO WERE FROM. THE STATE THIS IS MORE OF AN ISSUE. DTS. DOES VERY LITTLE PEAK WORK WITH PVM AS WE USE THEM ON A LIMITED BASIS FOR SERVICE DELIVERY TO CERTAIN. POPULATIONS THAT NEED TO USE A RETAIL PHARMACY -- FOR THE MOST PART WE DO NOT -- FOR OUR OWN -- ACTIVITIES AS A PURCHASE -- BUT THE THE THE CONCEPT OF FINDING WAYS TO CAPTURE THE VALUE THAT THE P. B. M.'S ARE CURRENTLY CAPTURING IS AN INTERESTING IDEA AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT. INTERNALLY I DON'T I HAVE NOT HEARD THE THE IDEA OF CREATING OUR OWN BEFORE BUT I THINK. A LOT OF POSSIBILITIES ARE ON THE TABLE RIVERSIDE COUNTY WHEN I WAS ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WE HAD A VERY BOLD IDEA. WE WE WANTED TO EMBRACE THE THE PACE PROGRAMS THE WESTERN COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS AND CAME UP WITH A PROGRAM WHERE YOU COULD -- EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY FINANCE SOLAR PANELS SO YOUR PROPERTY TAXES IT WAS SUCH A GREAT PROGRAM WE SEVERAL WHEN WE EXPAND IT STATEWIDE. AND AS A RESULT WE CREATED SAVINGS FOR BENEFICIARIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOUBLE YOUR CARD OF COURSE GOT SOME ADDITIONAL REVENUE THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE FOR EVEN MORE SERVICES. TO RESIDENTS OF RIVERSIDE COUNTY IF WE WE SET UP THE TEMPLATE OF A STATE PBM AND WE COULD CONTRACT TO STATES LIKE. OREGON AND WASHINGTON -- THERE COULD BE SOME REVENUE STREAMS EVEN FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WHY SHOULD THE OF THE STATE'S RECREATE THE WHEEL WE'VE GOT THE THE HORSEPOWER TO DO WITH OUR POPULATION -- I THINK IT COULD BE BENEFICIAL TO TO MANY OF THE WESTERN STATES THAT I THINK WOULD BE STANDING IN LINE TO JOIN OUR EFFORTS. OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MANAGER I DON'T KNOW HOW I TOP THAT. SENATOR PLEASE DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE. TO THANK YOU MISTER BENDER BECAUSE BECAUSE WE ARE YOU KNOW YOU'RE ALREADY DOING VOLUME PRICING. YOU'VE GOT CLOUT. IN IN YOUR READY A SIGNIFICANT PLAYER AND I'M JUST WONDERING YOU KNOW MAYBE A SHORT ANSWER JUSTICE YOU KNOW JUST TO THE RAP IT INTO A SMALL BALL BUT BUT BUT HOW DO YOU. HOW DO YOU BUILD ESSES CLOUD EVEN MORE? TO YOU KNOW SQUEEZE OUT. A LITTLE MORE RAIN BUT HOW DO YOU ADD VALUE -- WELL HOW WE ADD VALUE -- RELATIVE TO WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW. IS -- I THINK THAT THE APPROACH IS TRYING TO SEE WHAT OTHER -- AGENCIES WE CAN WORK WITH -- IT ALL ENDS IT IN. IN IN THE NEAR TERM ND THEN WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT PRIVATE PURCHASERS AS WELL -- TO SEE YOU KNOW HOW CAN WE PUT THE PURCHASING POWER TOGETHER WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT -- WHAT ARE THE MEDICATIONS THAT OTHER AGENCIES ARE OURS AND I'M JUST WNDERING HOW DO YOU QUANTIFY IT MEAN? CAN YOU SAY I'M GONNA GET. THE DOLLAR OFF OF X.IN MIDDLE TRANSIT INTO WHY A WHAT. WHAT WE WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AS A AS A GOAL AS A? AS A RESULT WELL -- OUR EXISTING SORT OF BENCHMARK WERE OR OR GOAL THAT WE USE ON A SCORE CARD THE FOR THE STATEWIDE PHARMACEUTICAL PROGRAM IS 60%. OFF OF SUGGESTED WHOLESALE PRICE AND I BELIEVE THE LATEST NUMBER I'VE SEEN IS THAT WERE AT SIXTY NINE AND A HALF SO. YOU'RE GONNA GO FOR SEVENTY YEARS -- SEVENTY ONE I YOU KNOW WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE GOING TO MAKE THE DECISION ON WHETHER WE WHETHER WE SET A HIGHER GOAL BUT YEAH WE WE DEFINITELY ARE LOOKING. TO WE'RE LOOKING TO SAVE THE STATE MONEY AND I THINK IN ADDITION. TO THE SORT OF BENCHMARK THAT WE USE FIRST FIRST AND SO FORTH -- WERE ALSO MINDFUL OF THE FACT IS THE AS PURCHASERS GENERALLY THAT A THAT A DISCOUNT OFF LIST PRICE. IS A DISCOUNT OFF LIST PRICE BUT THE LIST PRICE CAN CHANGE. SO WE ALSO WANT TO LOOK AT THE DELTA WATER WE GETTING THAT WE DIDN'T GET BEFORE AND WE'RE ALWAYS TRIED TO WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO GET A LOWER PRICE. THANK YOU THANK YOU MEASURE. EVERYTHING. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH -- I KNOW WE'RE GOING. TO THE SPELL BE FOLLOWED BY A DTS ON ONE THING AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE INTERFACES BETWEEN THE TWO BECAUSE I GUESS IN THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER BASICALLY WITH ATTRACT FREE. ONE LARGE POOL. RIGHT SO FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW -- DO YOU DO ANY NEGOTIATION FOR MEDI CAL PATIENTS SO WE HAVE THE WE HAVE A BUDGET. WE HAVE A GOOD CHUNK THAT -- OUR FEE FOR SERVICE ACTUALLY -- AFFECT ME THE MOST EXPENSIVE MEDIC THE THE PHILLY -- MEDICATIONS ARE CARVED OUT SO THERE. SO THAT IF YOU -- SO THAT BEING HANDLED BY MEDI CAL DIRECTLY RIGHT NOW OR DO YOU ARE YOU INVOLVED IN THAT AT ALL -- I THINK I I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY SPECIFIC TGS ROLE THAT'S THAT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED FOR THE TRANSITION. TO FEE FOR SERVICE -- OVER IT MEDI CAL -- CURRENTLY THE TO CURRENTLY MEDIC HELP -- CHOIRS DRUGS YOU KNOW COMPLETELY INDEPENDENTLY FROM DJ US AND WE'RE NOT TRYING TO REPLICATE WHAT THEY DO -- BUT OBVIOUSLY WE'RE TALKING TOGETHER RIGHT WE'RE TALKING WITH THE AC US ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER -- AND WHAT WE CAN TO THE ISLANDS THERE'S A LOT OF THEIR A LOT OF WRINKLES TO FIGURE OUT -- THERE ARE A LOT OF THEIR A LOT OF SPECIFIC PROGRAMMATIC ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE IT THE ACS THE WE DON'T HAVE AS A AS A TRUE PURCHASER -- THE I MEAN THEY'RE OPERATING ON A DIFFERENT JUSTICE THE JUST TO CLARIFY MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE EXECUTIVE ORDER WAS TO CREATE THIS LARGER PULL SO ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT YOU'RE STILL FIGURING ARE YOU. SO IS THE INTENTION. TO BRING ALL THE PURCHASING UNDER. TGS UNDER YOUR PROGRAM THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT THESE A WATER SAID. ED TO GET THAT WRONG. I DON'T THINK. I DON'T THINK THAT IS DEFINITELY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO END UP WITH CERTAINLY WE'RE TRYING CERTAINLY WERE TRYING TO CONSOLIDATE. OKAY BUT THE BUT THEY'RE ALSO GOING TO BE SOME REPORTS THERE'S WERE OTHERS -- MAY REPORT FROM US AND THEN I BELIEVE A JULY REPORT FROM DEC US -- THAT ARE GONNA HAVE SOME IDEAS OKAY. FOR STATUTORY FOR POSSIBLY STATUTORY CHANGE -- THEIR VARIETY OF WAYS THAT YOU COULD PUT THE TWO THINGS TOGETHER THAT MIGHT NOT BE TGS ASSUMES TOTAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT WELL OKAY SO I WOULD APPRECIATE. BEING KEPT APPRISED OF THAT ALL IS. NOW IN THE BUDGET SO COMMUTER BUT THE HEALTH COMMITTEE CHAIR BECAUSE NOW BECAUSE THE NEXT QUESTION IS IS THAT. I WAS ASSUMING UNDER EXECUTIVE TO WE'RE GOING TO COME TOGETHER AYE EXPRESSION TO YOU WOULD THAT IS WHO HAS RESPONSIBILITY OVER. FOR EXAMPLE THE FORMULARY. AND IS UP TO YOU HAVE YOUR OWN PROCESS FOR DEVELOPING FORMULA AIRY. DTS L. HAS ITSELF HOW WE'RE GOING TO DEVELOP FORMERLY HOOPS WHO'S PROVIDING INPUT INTO THAT FORMULARY. SO WE TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW THE ROLE OF PROVIDERS ACTUALLY TAKING CARE PATIENTS BE SURE THAT THE FORMALLY ANY PART OF IT OBVIOUSLY ONE THE BIG GOALS IS. TO LOWER THE PRICE BUT YOU ALSO BE SURE YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE RIGHT KIND OF DRUGS HOW DO YOU DECIDE THAT HADES FIVE DRUGS ARE ALL SENSEI DENTICLE ARE NOT OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT CLASS LIKE I DID I SAID ANTI HYPERTENSIVE AS WELL AND SAY A PRETENCE OF YOU COULD HAVE BETA BLOCKERS YOU CAN HAVE DIURETICS YOU CAN HAVE SO YOU KNOW IS THAT WHAT I DID HOW BROADLY YOU CLASSIFY THEM AS BEING IN QUOTE THE SAME CLASS RIGHT. DEPENDS ON HOW YOU. CLASSIFY CLASS BETTER THAN OTHERS AND SO FORTH SO. SO WHO'S MAKING THOSE KIND OF DECISIONS BECAUSE EVENTUALLY A AND THEN ALSO WHO'S GOING TO MAKE THE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT ARE THOSE THE ONLY SAID PREFERRED. MEDICATION FINE SO WHAT. ARE THE BARRIERS TO GETTING THE QUOTE NON PREFERRED MEDICATION SO -- YELLED AT NO PRIOR YOU TALK ABOUT PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS BY THE WAY THERE'S A WHOLE PROBLEM WITH BIRD PHYSICIAN BURN OUT PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS IN THAT DENIAL OF ACCESS TO CARE NOT SAYING THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY IS MECHANISMS. AND ANY QUESTIONS HOW OFTEN THE APPLIED TO FOR EXAMPLE -- IF YOU NEED A PRIOR AUTHORIZATION FOR A QUOTE NON FORMULARY DRIVE. IS THAT SOMETHING YOU JUST DO ONCE AND YOU'RE DONE IS THAT SOMETHING EVERY REFILL I GOT A RECENT RESUBMIT PAPERWORK ON THE OTHER EXTREME IS IT BY THE WAY BECAUSE WE DO MEDI CAL COUNTY BY COUNTY AND ALSO WE HAVE COUNTIES MULTIPLE PLANS MY COUNTY SACRAMENTO HAS SIX PLANS. I BELIEVE -- SO IF THEY CHANGE FROM ONE PLAN TO ANOTHER DO YOU START ALL OVER AGAIN. ARE YOU MOVE FROM ONE COUNTY TO ANOTHER DO YOU START ALL OVER AGAIN OR DO WE SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WE KNOW THAT THIS WAS THE MEDICATION REALLY WORKS FOR YOU WE DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN RIGHT. IF YOU CHANGE -- MEDICAL GROUPS SO THOSE ARE AS I AND SO HAVING SOME CLARITY ABOUT WHO'S OVERSEEING WHAT. AND THEN YOUR PROCESS OF NEGOTIATING BECAUSE RIGHT NOW YOU'RE NEGOTIATING ESSENTIALLY FOR ENTITIES THAT. TAKE THE MEDICATION AND AND STUFF LIKE THAT CDC ARE RIGHT I MEAN IT'S NOT THAT THE YELLED A LOT LIKE THE INMATES ARE GOING AROUND BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT. SO IT'S NOW IT'S GONNA BE A BIT DIFFERENT YOU OF ALL THESE DIFFERENT PROVIDERS AND SO FOR THE A DIFFERENT PHARMACISTS YOU HAVE MEDICATIONS ARE ADMINISTERED BY A YOUNG CLINICIANS ITS ADDRESS. SO HOW IS SO -- SO ANYTIME YOU'RE GONNA INTERFACE OR SOMEONE'S GONNA BE INTERFACING WITH THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES SAYING WE'RE NEGOTIATING RIGHT. AND SO THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO KNOW. OKAY WELL WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE THE PREFERRED MEDICATION RIGHT AND HOW MUCH IS THAT DRIVE BUSINESS TOWARD MY MEDICATION VERSUS SOMEONE ELSE'S LIKE HOW MUCH MORE MARKET SHARE BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO AFFECT YOUR NEGOTIATING POSITION. RIGHT SO AND TRY TO GET SOME CLARITY AS TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WHO'S DOING ANY COACHING WHICH AGENCY IS A D. G. S. R.. AND BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND IS A BIG PULL AND THEN WHO'S GOING TO BE SETTING THE RULES FOR ALL THESE OTHER THINGS BECAUSE FRANKLY -- NOW I AM A MEDIC CAL PROVIDER I'M GOING TO HEAR FROM PATIENTS BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I ALSO TELL THIS PATIENTS TO GO TALK TO THEIR LEGISLATOR ABOUT WHY THEY CAN GET THE MEDICATION ON FORCING IN THIS DISTRICT THAT STILL BE. FOR MY COLLEAGUES -- THAT WILL BE -- YOU KNOW THAT THEY'LL BE SO SO SO SO WE NEED TO PROVIDE SOME CLARITY THERE AND MAYBE YOU DON'T HAVE THE ANSWERS NOW BUT I DO EXPECT TO HEAR IT TO WHEN WE DO OUR BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS. BUT WE DEFINITELY WANT TO KNOW THOSE ANSWERS AND IF WE COULD HEAR THAT IS -- THAT WE WOULD GET THOSE IN THAT INFORMATION AND STATE HAVING TO ASK FOR IT ALL THE TIME. AND AND BY THE WAY I KNOW THE JUST GONNA COME UP TO ME ASKING SIMILAR QUESTIONS BUT YES. AND DOCTOR BROWN I UNDERSTAND -- IT WAS NOT BUDGET COMMITTEES STAFF ASSUMPTION THAT IT WAS ALL CAN BE ROLLED INTO ONE BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME FEDERAL RESTRICTIONS -- SO WE MIGHT OFFLINE HAVE TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A BACKGROUND IN TERMS OF WHITE CAN'T BE FRAME THAT WAY. CRACKING GOING RESPOND THAT BE GREAT. THANK YOU OF AND THIS IS THE CENTER PAN HAS HAS -- UP A NUMBER OF THOSE ISSUES I'VE I'VE I'VE HEARD A COUPLE OF THOSE I'M HEARING FOR THE FIRST TIME SO I'M GLAD WE'RE HAVING THIS HEARING -- SO -- BUT THE THERE ARE AS SENATOR PANNED THE SO ELOQUENTLY DESCRIBED THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLICATIONS IS AND HOW YOU SET UP A PHARMACY. THEIR NUMEROUS COMPLICATIONS IN GOVERNANCE OVER THE PHARMACY OUR ASSUMPTION IS THAT THE AGENCIES THAT ARE PARTICIPATING. IN THE IN THE PURCHASING PROGRAM WOODS -- IDEALLY COLLECTIVELY DECIDE ON THE PHARMACY -- WE D. G. S.. YOU KNOW DON'T ARE DICTATORS IN THAT REGARD WE WERE -- BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE DEPTH OF CLINICAL EXPERTISE IN HOW THESE MEDICATIONS ARE USED IN THERE YET IN THEIR SETTINGS -- SO WE WOULD EXPECT THAT. WE WOULD EXPECT THAT IT WOULD BE A COLLECTIVE EFFORT TO SET FOR FORMULAR RULES -- AS FOR THE EXACT SHOWN TO YOU KNOW HOW YOU SET UP A PRIOR AUTHORIZATION SYSTEM. IN ORDER TO SUPPORT GOOD PATIENT CARE. AND AVOID DRIVING THE PHYSICIANS CRAZY -- THOSE ARE BOTH IMPORTANT GOALS A WITH THE THAT WE WOULD DEFINITELY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT -- OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW WE ARE TRYING TO REDUCE THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IN A WAY THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH GOOD PATIENT CARE -- KEEP IN MIND IT'S AT BOSTON I CARE ABOUT PHYSICIANS I GOING CRAZY MORE IMPORTANT LIKE THE PATIENTS THE BECAUSE OF THE PATIENTS GET FRUSTRATED THEY CAN'T A EDUCATIONS INDEED. SO -- AND I ATE FROM WHAT I'M HEARING PERHAPS AT ANY AND I WANT SELL MAYBE DH CS WHO SETS THOSE RULES. BUT YOU'RE THE NEGOTIATOR TO CERTAINLY OF DEPENDING ON AND WE'LL GO OF COURSE FEATURE WE FOLLOW CERTAIN FEDERAL RULES FOR EXAMPLE MEDI CAL YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE ALL MEDICALLY NECESSARY. MEDICATION SO I GOT THAT. I WOULD SAY IN TERMS OF A NEAR TERM -- OBJECTIVE -- WE MAY IDENTIFY IT OF A FEW DRUGS -- OR A FEW THERAPEUTIC CLASSES TO TARGET FIRST AND SO IT MAY BE AN INTERIM SITUATION WHERE WE START OUT OKAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS. A CLASS CAN WE ALL AGREE THAT YOU KNOW CAN WE ALL AGREE THAT IF THE DISCOUNT ON THIS IS GOOD ENOUGH IT'S A FIRST. THEN WE CAN AGREE TO THE SIDE OF FORMULARY RULES THIS PRIOR AUTHORIZATION -- APPROACH FOR THE JUST FOR THIS CLASS WE ALSO HAVE OUR OWN FORMULAR IS BUT WERE AGREEING ON HOW WE HANDLE THIS PARTICULAR CLASS. THAT CAN BE AN INITIAL STAGE TOWARD EVENTUALLY GETTING TO A MORE MERCH SYSTEM. WELL A LOOK FOR TEN CAN I GUESS TO POINT OUT AND THAT THERE ARE MANY OPTIONS I THINK PEOPLE ARE POINTING OUT YOU KNOW POTENTIAL CHALLENGES TO AN IMPLEMENTATION OF A BOOK PURCHASING PROGRAM ACROSS BUYERS IN PAIRS IN THOSE COMPLICATIONS. AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE THE THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS LAYING OUT IS LET'S GATHER THE DATA PRESENT OPTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION FOR THE GOVERNOR TO COME FORWARD IN THE FUTURE. BUDGET OR ARE AT SOMETIME I WE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW THE VEHICLE IN WHICH THAT WOULD SHOW -- COME TO ALL -- FOR CONSIDERATION ABOUT HOW TO CHANGE EXCELLENT POINTS AS DID OTHER SENATORS -- BUT AND WILL TAKE THAT IS FOOD FOR CONSIDERATION OF FOOD FOR THOUGHT SO. THANK YOU ANYTHING YOU WANNA. SEE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH JOHN WE APPRECIATE YOU. GOING TO TRANSITION COLLEAGUES -- TO THE TRANSITION INTO FEE FOR SERVICE FOR ALL IN THE MEDI CAL PHARMACY PROGRAM DIRECTOR CAN'T THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. HAPPY NEW YEAR AND HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY. WE HAVEN'T SEEN YOU BEFORE COMMITTEE. MISTER MILLER -- ASSISTANT PROGRAM BUDGET MANAGER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND MISTER JOHNSON WILL BE JOINING US AS WELL. DIRECTOR CAN'T MAKE HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY LITTLE HEART HERE JUSTINO FOR EXTRA FOR THE LOWER. BACK READ LOW -- SO I THINK YOU I WANT -- TO FIRST START OFF BY -- SCENE THAT YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S X. SENATE VERY -- DIFFERENT TRACKS OF WORK THAT WE INDEED YES ARE COLLABORATING ON JUST -- TO PUT A FINE POINT ON IT IS THAT D. G. S. AS THEY BALK PURCHASER OF PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES AND MEDI CAL AND OTHER TYPES OF EMPLOYERS LIKE CALPERS ARE -- PAYERS SO WHEN A INSTITUTION OR AN ORGANIZATION GHOSTED YES AND SAYS WE WOULD LIKE A THOUSAND DOSES OF FILL IN THE BLANK DDS GOES THEY NEGOTIATE WITH THE MANUFACTURER. AND THEN THOSE THOUSAND DOSES ARE DISTRIBUTED TO THAT POPULATION FOR WHICH THE ORGANIZATION IS BUYING ON BEHALF OF SO BE AT CDC OUR STATE HOSPITALS DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER -- OBVIOUSLY AS A PAIR AS MEDICARE ALL WE HAVE PATIENTS THAT RECEIVED PRESCRIPTIONS FROM THEIR PHYSICIAN THEY GO INTO A PHARMACY THE PHARMACY DISPENSES THE PRESCRIPTION AND WE REIMBURSE. US SO IT IS A VERY DIFFERENT -- PURCHASING MECHANISM AND SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT -- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE TASKS RELATED TO DO AS TO A BOOK PURCHASE SCENE -- COOPERATIVE WITH LARGER PARTICIPATION BY BOTH OTHER STATE ENTITIES AS WELL AS PRIVATE ENTITIES. AND THEN WE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES -- NOT ONLY ARE LOOKING TO MAKE CHANGES WITHIN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM MORE BARK BROADLY TO LEVERAGE OUR PURCHASING POWER BUT ALSO LOOKING AT OTHER TYPES OF SOLUTIONS IN WHICH WE CAN TRY TO LEVERAGE MEDI CAL AS A PLATFORM PROGRAM IF YOU WILL. TO DRIVE DOWN PRICES FOR OTHER TYPES OF PAYERS. I THINK -- YOU KNOW THERE WAS A HEARING PROBABLY A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND SO I SAVED -- SOME OF MY FAX JUST BECAUSE I LIKE SAID THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT WE'VE HAD THIS DISCUSSION IN THE LEGISLATURE -- I THINK I STARTED THESE DISCUSSIONS BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR WHEN I WAS WITH THE DEPARTMENT THE FIRST TIME -- SO WHEN WE LOOK AT CATALOG PRICING FOR CERTAIN CLASSES OF DRUGS IN MEDIC HOW -- AND WE HAVE THIS BUT IT WAS THE PRICING OVER FOR YOUR FOR DRUGS THAT WE EITHER COVER OR HAVE TO MAKE AVAILABLE TO BENEFICIARIES BASED ON MEDICAL NECESSITY. MOST OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH SB PEN CRACKS -- THAT AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICE OVER A FOUR YEAR PERIOD WENT UP BY TWO HUNDRED AND 69% SET ONE UP FROM EIGHTY TWO DOLLARS TO TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY AND THAT'S THE CHEAPEST INCREASE ON THIS CHART. WE HAVE DRUGS -- THAT ARE FOR ANTI CONVULSANT -- WENT UP FROM FIVE CENTS A TABLET TO A DOLLAR TWENTY TWO WHICH YOU SAY THAT'S NOT BAD BUT THAT WAS A TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND WE HAVE A DIABETES DRUG THAT WENT FROM TO CENTS A TABLET TO A DOLLAR SEVENTEEN THAT'S A FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND 32% PRICE INCREASE -- WE HAVE AN ANTI DEPRESSANT THAT WENT FROM EIGHT CENTS A CAPSULE TO FIVE DOLLARS AND SEVENTEEN CENTS. 6290% INCREASE -- HYPERTENSIVE -- WAS -- TWO CENTS A TABLET IT WENT TO A DOLLAR 854-700-0100 AND 46% PRICE INCREASE. MY FAVORITE -- IS A CAPSULE FOR EARTH THYROID THOUGH SENATOR STONE JUST LAUGHS I'M GONNA WITH HIM FOR MY PHARMACY -- IT WAS FOR SENSE -- A CAPSULE IT WENT TO TWENTY TWO DOLLARS AND NINETY SIX CENTS IT WAS A 4900071% IN CRISIS INCREASE IN PRICE. I THINK WHEN THE GOVERNOR TALKED ABOUT -- THE PRICE SCENE -- AND THE FACT THAT IS UNSUSTAINABLE -- MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES DON'T HAVE -- THEY'RE PROTECTED FROM THESE COST INCREASES WE OBVIOUSLY AS A STATE WHERE THE IMPACT OF THOSE PRICE INCREASES WE OBVIOUSLY TRY TO DO OUR BEST THROUGH -- SUPPLEMENTAL REBATE NEGOTIATIONS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE ENCOURAGING PLANS TO USE THE MOST EFFICACIOUS AND EFFICIENT -- DRUGS AS POSSIBLE BUT I THINK WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE LARGER ISSUES AROUND THE POPULATIONS THAT DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF EITHER MEDICAL COVERAGE OR THEY ARE IN THE DOUGHNUT HOLE IF THEIR MEDICARE PART D. RECIPIENT OR IF THEY ARE ON THE PRIVATE MARKET ND DON'T HAVE. ON ARE THEY HAVE A HIGH DEDUCTIBLE AND THEY'RE AT RISK FOR DRUGS UP TO A CERTAIN DOLLAR AMOUNT. THESE PRICE INCREASES FOR THEM ARE EXTRAORDINARILY BOTH -- IMPORTANT AND IN SOME CASES SIGNIFICANT SUCH THAT THEY CAN'T ACTUALLY ACCESS THE DRUG AND SO I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF LAY THAT OUT THERE FOR PURPOSES OF THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER. IS REALLY ASKING US AS A STATE DEPARTMENT TO LOOK AT SOLUTIONS MORE BROADLY NOT JUST SO THAT WE SOLVE OUR OWN PUBLIC PURCHASING ISSUES AROUND THE PRICE OF DRUGS BUT ALSO LOOK TO SOLUTIONS THAT CAN HELP. NOT ONLY OTHER STATE PURCHASERS BUT OTHER PURCHASE YOU KNOW DOWN TO THE CONSUMER INDIVIDUAL LEVEL IN CALIFORNIA SO THOSE ARE THE KIND OF IDEAS AND RECOMMENDATIONS AND SOLUTIONS THAT WE ARE LOOKING TO PROVIDE TO THE GOVERNOR BY THE JULY TWELFTH ST. I'M SPECIFIED IN THE EXECUTIVE ORDER -- IN THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER IT WAS ALSO -- DIRECTED THAT WE WOULD BE CARVING OUT. ALL PHARMACY BENEFITS -- IN THE MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PROGRAM AND RETURNING THEM TO THE FEE FOR SERVICE PROGRAM -- THEIR WORST MULTIPLE REASONS FOR THE INCLUSION OF THAT PROPOSAL IN THE EXECUTIVE ORDER -- OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE FIRST AND MOST OBVIOUS IS THAT -- BY ACCUMULATING ALL OF THE MILLIONS OF LIVES WE CURRENTLY pOFFER COVERAGE -- FOR WE HAVE TWO MILLION APPROXIMATELY IN FEE FOR SERVICE WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN MILLION IN MANAGED CARE. BY PUTTING THOSE ALL INTO -- ONE PURCHASING POOL WE ALL HAVE OBVIOUSLY INCREASE OUR NEGOTIATING LEVERAGE TO DRIVE BETTER DEALS WITH MANUFACTURERS AS WELL AS MORE SIGNIFICANT REBATES. BUT I THINK ANOTHER -- REASON THAT WE AS OF STEP IN AND MULTIPLE STEP SOLUTION IS -- FROM AN ACCESS POINT IN YOU KNOW SENATOR PAN WAS CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THIS AS WELL IS -- ACCESS -- IN MEDI CAL PHARMACY AND A FEE FOR SERVICE ENVIRONMENT WE HAVE -- PROVIDER AGREEMENTS WITH 97% OF THE PHARMACIES IN THE FEE FOR SERVICE SIDE. SO ACCESS FROM A STANDPOINT IN THE FEE FOR SERVICE SIDE IS ACTUALLY BETTER THAN IT IS AND THE MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE MARKET TODAY -- I THINKS THE OTHER THING THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CONCERNED AROUND IS THE IDEA OF A FORMULA. IN MEDI CAL SO WE DON'T HAVE A FORMULAR YOU WE HAVE A CONTRACTOR GLASS WHICH IS A SERIES OF DRUGS THAT WE HAVE SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES IN PLACE WITH ON THE MANUFACTURER'S. AND SO -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO BEFORE WE PUT ADDRESS ON THE CONTRACT DRUG LIST AS WE LOOK AT IT FOR EFFICACIOUS NOUS FOR SAFETY FOR POTENTIAL FOR MISUSE -- FOR OTHER ALTERNATIVES -- AND OBVIOUSLY COST IS ALWAYS -- AN IMPORTANT FACTOR FOR US IN THE CONSIDERATION OF THAT. PATIENTS ARE ABLE TO GET DRUGS THAT ARE NOT ON THE CONTRACTOR GLASSED AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO GET DRUGS -- AS THEY ARE APPROPRIATELY PRESCRIBED BY THEIR PHYSICIAN REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY ARE ON THE CONTRACT RECKLESS OR NOT THE CONTRACT RECKLESS IS REALLY. IN OUR WAY -- OF SETTING UP A NEGOTIATING MECHANISM WITH MANUFACTURERS WHICH IS IF YOU WANT TO BE ON THE CONTRACTOR OF LIST -- WE TYPICALLY PUT DRUGS ON THERE WITHOUT A PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENT BUT IN EXCHANGE THERE ARE SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES THAT ARE PAID BY THAT MANUFACTURE IN ORDER TO HAVE PLACEMENT ON THAT LIST BUT IT IS NOT. A FORMULARY -- SOME OF THE REASONS -- ALSO THAT WE ARE OUT WORKING TO CARVE THE DRUGS OUT OF THE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE -- WORLD IS AND WE ARE LOOKING TO STANDARDIZE BENEFITS ACROSS OUR DIFFERENT MODELS AND ACROSS THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES. OVER THE COURSE OF TIME AS A PROGRAM -- WE HAVE CARVE DRUGS IN AND OUT BASED ON COST BASED ON NEED -- SO FOR EXAMPLE BLOOD FACTOR IS A GOOD EXAMPLE WE HAVE HAD THAT INTO THE MANAGED CARE CONTRACTS WE'VE HAD IT OUT IT'S NOW CARVED OUT WE HAVE HIV DRUGS THAT ARE CARVED OUT THE PLANS ARE NOT. RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM -- WE TREAT HEPATITIS C. DRUGS AS A CATEGORY-- SOMEWHAT DIFFERENTLY THAN THE REST THEY GET A SUPPLEMENTAL CAPITATION PAYMENT -- BASED ON THE PATIENT BEING PRESCRIBE SOMETHING IN THE HEPATITIS C. CATEGORY AND SO WE ARE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING THE BENEFIT -- AND CONTINUING TO MAKE SURE THAT BEEN A FISHERIES HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THE DRUGS THAT THEY ARE PRESCRIBED BY THEIR PROVIDER WE HAVE CHOSEN -- IN THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER AND IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO SAY THAT WE THINK THAT IT IS BOTH -- BETTER ACCESS FOR THE PATIENT AS WELL AS THERE ARE SEVERAL PURCHASE SCENE -- OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE CAN USE IN THE SHORT TERM -- AS A STATE BY DOING THAT AND PUTTING IT THROUGH THE FEE FOR SERVICE SYSTEM -- THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS IS -- OTHER STATES ARE LOOKING AND GRAPPLING WITH THIS ISSUE AS WELL -- THERE ARE A VARIETY OF ALTERNATIVES THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO SEE A MASS -- I THINK THAT -- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT JUST RELEASED A PROPOSED DRAFT RULE A COUPLE IT MAY HAVE ONLY BEEN A WEEK AGO BUT IT FEELS LIKE LONGER IT MAY HAVE JUST BEEN A WEEK AGO -- TO CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN P. B. M.'S AND MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PLANS AND MEDICARE PART D. PLANS -- AND THEY'RE TRYING TO BASICALLY REMOVES THE ABILITY FOR PM'S TO HAVE PREFERENTIAL -- STEERING OF DRUGS BASED ON THE AGREEMENTS THAT THEY HAVE WITH THE MANUFACTURERS AND INSTEAD TURNING THAT INTO A FLAT FEE TYPE OF SERVICE ARRANGEMENT. THE THING THAT WE WOULD SAY IT'S INCLUDED IN THE FEDERAL THE DRAFT FEDERAL RULE IS IT WILL INCREASE PRICES IRONICALLY TO STATE PURCHASERS AND TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE NO LONGER OUR PLANS GOING TO BE RECEIVING EITHER DISCOUNTS ARE REBATES. DUE TO THOSE PBM ARRANGEMENTS AND THERE'S A FLAT FEE AND SO ACTUALLY IT RAISES THE COST OF DRUGS WHICH IN. SOME CASES JUST CONFIRMS THAT WE ARE ON THE RIGHT PATH IN TERMS OF REMOVING THE DRUGS OUT OF THE MANAGED CARE CONTRACTS ALL TOGETHER AND PUTTING THEM INTO THE FEE FOR SERVICE -- SYSTEM SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. BEFORE WE DO THAT -- LET'S HEAR FROM MR MILLER DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD. OKAY GREAT MISTER JOHNSON I WOULD MEAN GREAT BUT YOU NONE OF THE MR JOHNSON -- SO WE HAVE NOT COMPLETED OUR ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BUT SO WHAT I'LL SHARE IS REALLY JUST SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND THE QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE ASKING. TIME FIRST IS WHAT WITH THE PROPOSAL ULTIMATELY RESULT INSTATE SAVINGS -- WE THINK IT COULD -- IT WOULD ALLOW THE STATE TO COLLECT -- OR AT LEAST -- FACILITATE THE STATE COLLECTING -- SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES ON BEHALF OF ALL THE PHARMACEUTICALS THAT ARE PAID -- FOR AS OPPOSED TO JUST THE SO THIS COULD ROW -- INCREASED DAY SAVINGS FOR TO THE TUNE OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. REFERENCE YOU WE DON'T HAVE A SOLID UNDERSTANDING OF THAT FOR CONTEXT THOUGH - THE STAE A WE GOT ESTIMATES FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THE STATE DOES SPEND -- NINE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY ON DRUGS WITHIN MANAGED CARE AS OPPOSED TO FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN FEE FOR SERVICE SO THERE IS THOSE ARE QUITE A THAT'S QUITE A BIT OF NEW -- SPENDING THAT COULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES ON CELLS CONTINUE TO ANALYZE THAT OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION -- SOMETIME WILL RELEASE A FISCAL ESTIMATE OF THIS AND WILL DEFINITELY LOOK VERY CLOSELY AT THAT -- I CYCLE A SECOND SORT OF POTENTIAL IMPACT -- IS THAT -- AS CENTER OFFICE BROUGHT UP -- IT THIS THIS -- PROPOSAL COULD RESULT IN SAVINGS THAT ARE RETAINED BY THREE FORTY BE ENTITIES -- THAT INSTEAD WOULD -- ULTIMATELY BENEFIT THE STATE SO THAT'S ANOTHER AVENUE FOR SAVINGS BUT AN IMPACT ON ON SAFETY NET PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND THEN THIRD THERE COULD BE SOME REDUCE COSTS IN MANAGED CARE -- AS A RESULT OF ADMINISTRATIVE UNDERWRITING -- COSTS GOING DOWN -- WITHIN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM -- THERE ARE STILL REASONS WE THINK TO BE CAUTIOUS -- ON THE POTENTIAL FOR SAVINGS -- MEDICARE PLANS CAN LEVERAGE THEIR THEIR BUYING POWER TO DETAIN YOU KNOW GOOD RATES WITH PHARMACIES AT THE TIME OF DISPENSING AND SO FORTH SO WE WILL LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT THAT WHAT GETS INCLUDED IN THE COST ESTIMATES THERE -- BUT THEN OUTSIDE OF THE COST ESTIMATE WERE OF COURSE TRYING -- TO IMPACTS ON PERRANCE WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT WILL IT COULD STANDARDIZATION OF THE DRUG BENEFIT -- BUT ALSO WANT UNDERSTAND HOW IT IMPACTS CARE COORDINATION -- THAT TIMELY SUBMISSION -- PHARMACEUTICAL UTILIZATION DATA TO MANAGED CARE PLANS AND TO THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS THAT ARE THAT ARE ULTIMATELY COORDINATING THEIR CARE SO -- THERE'S NOT A LOT WE STILL A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND A LOT TO CONSIDER IN ANALYZING THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU ARE I I TOO AM SORRY A DOCTOR PAN IS IN HERE WE HAD A DISCUSSION AT OUR BUDGET. HEARING BRIEFING YESTERDAY -- A ABOUT THE TRANSITION FROM TO FEE FOR SERVICE ON HE EXPRESS OF THE THE CHALLENGES AS A PROVIDER HIMSELF IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO PRESCRIBE AND GUARANTEE YOUR PATIENT HAS A MEDICATION THAT AS THE POSITION HE THINKS IS IN THEIR BEST INTEREST. YOU MADE REFERENCE TO A CONTRACT DRUG LIST AND THAT I I UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECTLY WHEN YOU DIFFERENTIATED. THAT FROM AN ACTUAL FORMULARY AS WE UNDERSTAND FORMULA IN HOW ARE THEY DIFFERENT -- I THINK THAT WHEN YOU HAVE -- FORMULAR USE AND THE RATE OF IN THE NON MEDICARE ALL PURCHASED SEEN IF IT'S NOT ON THE FORMULARY THAT YOU REALLY DO HAVE TO GO THROUGH PROBABLY A PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY AND IN SOME CASES I'LL JUST SAY IT'S NOT A COVERED DRUG RIGHT SO THEY'LL SAY THAT. YOU KNOW THAT IS A DRUG YOUR PHYSICIAN MAY BE PRESCRIBING IT TO YOU BUT WE DON'T COVER AND SO THEREFORE THE BENEFICIARY OR THE COVERED IN ROWLEY HAS TO GO AND JUST. PAY CASH FOR IT AND MEDI CAL SESSION WRITES A SCRIPT FOR SOMEONE AND IT'S NOT ON THE CD L. THEY HAVE TO DO TREATMENT AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED OKAY AND THEN WE WOULD COVER IT AND ALSO THE BUT THEN HE THAT HE DID AND HE DID ACKNOWLEDGE IN OUR CONVERSATION. THE CHALLENGES FROM HIM BECAUSE IT FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE OF EVEN GOING TO THE TAR PROCESS BUT IT IS DIFFERENT IN THAT THROUGH THE TAR PROCESS. BE IT ONEROUS AND TIME CONSUMING BUT YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THE MEDICATION. AS OPPOSED TO A FORMER PROCESS WHERE YOU CANNOT. OKAY AND THEN THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY AND I FORGOT TO MENTION THIS IS AND I KNOW THAT -- DOCTOR PAN AND OTHERS HAVE CERTAINLY EXPRESSED CONCERN AROUND THE CARE COORDINATION SO FOR BENEFICIARIES THAT ARE ENROLLED IN MANAGED CARE TODAY AND THEY DO RECEIVE A CARVED OUT DRUGS SO SAY YOU HAVE SOMEONE. WITH -- CAM APHELIA AND THEY ARE ARE RECEIVING BLOOD FACTOR AND THAT IS BEING -- BOTH -- HANDLED AND DISPENSED AND WRITTEN IN THE FEE FOR SERVICE AND REIMBURSED IN THE FEE FOR SERVICE WE PROVIDE THAT DATA AND FLOW THAT DATA THE PLANS WE FLOAT ON A MONTHLY BASIS I THINK THAT WE RECOGNIZE -- WITH THE SHIFT INTO FEE FOR SERVICE THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE SOME CHANGES WITHIN OUR OWN SYSTEMS WHICH IS WHY IN SOME CASES THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. SAYS JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE ISIN WHICH WE WOULD BE FLOWING THAT INFORMATION -- IN A MUCH MORE RAPID WAY SUCH THAT PLANS WOULD BE AWARE OF WHAT BENEFICIARIES ARE GETTING IN TERMS OF PHARMACY CLAIMS. IN THE FEE FOR SERVICE WORLD TODAY -- WE GET PRETTY TIMELY CLAIMS JUST BECAUSE PHARMACIES DISPENSING DRUGS AND PRETTY MUCH SUBMIT A CLAIM ON THE SAME DAY IT'S A IT'S A PRETTY INSTANTANEOUS. OUR SYSTEM SO I THINK THAT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE SYSTEMS ISSUES THAT WE'RE AWARE OF AND WE CERTAINLY ARE COGNIZANT OF AND NOT WANTING TO DISRUPT. THE PLANS ABILITY TO SEETHE FULL ARRAY OF SERVICES THAT A BENEFICIARY MAY BE RECEIVING AND IN SOME CASES THERE ARE OTHER CARVE OUT SERVICES THAT PLANS ON ACTUALLY GET ACCESS TO THAT DATA AND SO. YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING -- TO IN MULTIPLE WAYS TO IMPROVE THAT DATA FLOW SUCH THAT PLANTS CAN SEE -- LOTS OF OTHER SERVICES THAT DON'T EXIST IN THEIR RESPONSIBILITY. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS FROM. COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SCENE NINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOU [inaudible] FOR WAITING. BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA TRANSITION INTO OUR STAKEHOLDER PANEL -- FOR THIS SECTION OF OUR AGENDA. AND WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM YOU CHAU CABRERA. S. CI YOU BEST THE PALE BRAD GILBERT. INLAND EMPIRE HEALTH PLAN BARBARA GLACIER FROM THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. ACTUALLY LESS SIX WITH THE I WITH FARMER SAY POLICY DIRECTOR FOR PHARMA. AND JOHN ROCK WITH THE CALIFORNIA PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION. I'M SORRY THAT OUR BIGGEST PANEL HAPPENS TO BE OUR LAST PANEL THE AFTERNOON BUT BE THAT AS IT MAY I'D ASK ALL OF YOU TO BE AS BRIEF AND YET COMPREHENSIVE AS POSSIBLE. WE'LL START WITH MISS CABRERA. GOOD AFTERNOON THINK YOU SO MUCH -- WE ARE HERE I'M HERE ON THE HAVE SCA YOU CALIFORNIA TO EXPRESS STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNOR'S VISION ON REFORMING HOW THE STATE PURCHASES PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. FOR OVER A THIRD OF CALIFORNIANS THROUGH BOTH ARE MEDI CAL AND OTHER STATE PURCHASERS OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY IS COMPLEX AND OPAQUE BY DESIGN SO THAT THE VARIOUS ACTORS CAN LEVERAGE THE MAXIMUM POP PROFITS POSSIBLE AND WE'VE HEARD A BIT ABOUT THAT IN THE DISCUSSION ON P. B. M.'S. WE'RE INTERESTED IN THE POSSIBILITIES OF SIR WHICH MAXIMIZES THE PUBLIC SECTOR SPEND FOR PHARMACY BENEFITS AND WHICH INVITES OTHER PUBLIC AS WELL AS PRIVATE PURCHASERS TO BUY INTO. AND WHILE WE REALIZE THAT MEDIC THE MEDIC HOW PIECES COMPLICATED BY BOTH MEDICAID BEST PRICE AND PROGRAMS SUCH AS THREE FORTY BEING IN THIS PHASE WE SHOULD BE ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE THE STATE IS NOT ADEQUATELY USING ITS SIZE AND SKILL. TO SAVE TAXPAYERS MONEY AND INNOVATE ON OUR DRUG PURCHASING WHILE AT THE SAME TIME PROTECTING MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES GUARANTEED ACCESS TO MEDICALLY NECESSARY DRUGS. AND FOR OUR SAFETY NET PROVIDERS TO REMAIN WHOLE. AS ONE EXAMPLE EVEN WITHIN MEDICAID OTHER STATES HAVE DONE AUDITS AND REPORTS WHICH YOU FOUND THAT PVM STILL HAVE A SPREAD AND THEY POCKET REBATES WITHOUT THE STATE PURCHASER KNOWING. DO OUR MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS WHO CONTRACTED P. P. B. M.'S TODAY KNOW THAT THEIR REBATES ARE BEING PASSED ON AND IS THERE TRANSPARENCY AROUND THE SPREAD IS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE THINK IS IMPORTANT. TO UNDERSTAND IF THERE IS SIGNIFICANT PUSHED BACK TO A CARVING THIS OUT INTO FEE FOR SERVICE -- WE NEED TO KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY WE'RE LEAVING ON THE TABLE AND I THINK EVEN THAT SORT OF PICTURE OF WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY SPENDING IS NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR. IN ADDITION ARE WE DOING ENOUGH TO ASSASSINATE INCENTIVIZE THE APPROPRIATE EFFECTIVE USE OF DRUGS. ARC RELEASED A REPORT THIS YEAR THAT FOUND THAT ONE IN FOUR ANTIBIOTICS -- IN COMMERCIAL COVERAGE WORK COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY AND A LARGE NUMBER OF THOSE WERE FOR CONDITIONS. THAT THEY DESCRIBED AS A NATION WHERE ANTIBIOTIC SHOULD NEVER BE USED AND SO THERE IS A TON OF EDUCATION THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT THOSE ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN ON THE BACK AND BETWEEN PERCH MANUFACTURERS PM'S AS WELL AS PHYSICIANS -- MEDI CAL THE TIME BEFORE THE NEXT BLOCKBUSTER DRUG HITS THE MARKET IN OVERWHELMS OUR STATE GENERAL FUND. THIS TYPE OF RISK REQUIRES CREATIVE POLICY SOLUTIONS INCLUDING CONSIDERATION OF AGGRESSIVE APPROACHES SUCH AS THE IDEA PUT FORTH BY A SENATOR STONE TODAY FOR A STATE RUN PBM -- AS WELL AS THE IDEA OF POT POSSIBLY LOOKING INTO THE STATE MANUFACTURING GENERICS ON ITS OWN -- WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE DONE TO A LIMITED DEGREE BUT COULD DO A LOT MORE OF WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR AND ON HIS PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROPOSAL AND APPRECIATE THE ATTENTION. TO THIS ABOUT FASTEST GROWING COST DRIVER AND HEALTHCARE THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS CAPELL BETH BILL ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA I'D LIKE TO BEGIN WITH A CLARIFICATION MADAM CHAIR. UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW OF HEALTH PLANS IN MOST HEALTH INSURERS ARE REQUIRED TO COVER ALL MEDICALLY NECESSARY DRUGS WHETHER THEY'RE ON THE FORMULARY OR NOT. THE EXCEPTION IS LARGE GROUP COVERAGE UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE WHICH WE HOPE TO RECTIFY THIS YEAR BUT OTHERWISE WHETHER TO ON THE FORMULARY OR NOT IT IS WRITTEN. IT IS REQUIRED THAT HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS COVER MEDICALLY NECESSARY DRUGS. AND THERE IS A PROCESS THE INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW PROCESS FOR DETERMINING WHETHER IT'S MEDICALLY NECESSARY OR NOT. IF THE PLAN IN THE PRESCRIBER CANNOT AGREE WE DO SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WE PROVIDE A LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR AND TO YOUR COMMITTEE AND OTHERS. WE THINK WITH SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES AND REBATES ON THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM CAN SAVE AS MUCH AS WE ARE GETTING THE MANDATORY REBATE WHICH IS ABOUT 23% -- BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THOSE SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES WHICH SHE HAD PIONEERED IN THE EARLY NINETIES. WE WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND THAT WE HAVE A SINGLE STATEWIDE FORMULARY AND THAT IT IS NEGOTIATED -- BY DRUG CLASS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS RATHER THAN BEING NEGOTIATED MANUFACTURE BY MANUFACTURERS SO CENTER PAN IN YOUR EXAMPLE OF HYPERTENSIVE IS THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH IN. EACH OF THE CATEGORIES IN THAT IF NONE OF THOSE FOR APPROPRIATE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL THAT SOMEONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THROUGH AN APPEAL PROCESS THE APPROPRIATE -- ANTI HAVE PRETENCE OF OFF FORMULAR. WE WOULD ALSO SUGGEST. THAT WE LOOK AT INFLATION ADJUSTED REBATES -- OR FLAT AMOUNT SO THAT WE DON'T TO AS THE PRICES INCREASING YOU HEARD FROM. MISS CAN'T THE DIRECTOR ABOUT SOME PRETTY DRAMATIC PRICE INCREASES THAT THOSE OF THAT WE CONTINUE TO KEEP THE AMOUNT TO THE STATE FLAT RATHER THAN. HAVING IT BE ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS. LIKE OTHERS WE SUGGEST LOOKING MULTI STATE EFFORTS WHETHER IT'S EFFECTIVENESS REVIEW OR PURCHASING. AND WE'RE VERY INTRIGUED BY THE IDEA THE STATE PBM AND WOULD BE INTERESTED IN. AND DISCUSSIONS ON THAT ONE FINAL POINT IS AS WERE THINKING ABOUT THIS -- IT. THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM INCLUDING THE MANAGED CARE TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE LAST. DECADE HAVING WE THINK ABOUT THE AC EXPANSION AND BRINGING IN TROUBLES ADULT BUT THE OTHER THINGS WITH OTHER THING WE HAVE DONE. ISSUE OF FROM FEE FOR SERVICE DEMAND THE DRAMATIC CHANGE IN AND OF ITSELF -- AS WE THINK ABOUT THOSE WE'RE NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR THAT THE MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE -- BARGAINING IN THE BEST INTEREST THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO WE WELCOME THE PROPOSAL AND FEE FOR SERVICE SO LONG AS IT'S DONE IN A WAY THAT. CONSUMERS HAVE MEDICALLY NECESSARY DRUGS AND THERE IS SOMETHING LIKE INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW TO ASSURE PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN GET WHATEVER THE NEW A STRONG GIVES WHETHER. IT'S IN THE MANAGED CARE CONTEXT OR NOT THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER GILBERT -- GOOD MORNING -- ACTUALLY NOW GOOD AFTERNOON -- I'M DOCTOR BRAD GILBERT ON THE CEO BY EACH P. WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR ORGANIZING THE CARE FOR ONE POINT TWO FOUR MILLION HUMAN BEINGS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE -- WHAT I WANT TO REALLY TALK ABOUT HIS CLINICAL ISSUES IS WHERE I WANT TO FOCUS I APPRECIATE THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ACOSTA NAY TOTALLY UNDERSTAND? THE IMPORTANCE OF COST IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM FOR SURE -- I DO WANT. TO GET A CO BEST -- COMMON ABOUT FORMULAR IS WE WERE ROUTINELY APPROVED DRUGS THAT ARE NOT ON THE FORMALLY THROUGH A PRIOR OFF PROCESS AND WE DO IT IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AS REQUIRED BY LAW. TO WERE VERY QUICK AND LOOKING AT THE NEED FOR THE DRUG AND APPROVING AT SO I'M GONNA TRY TO TALK ABOUT THREE KEY AREAS JUST AS EXAMPLES NUMBER ONE IS OPIOIDS. SO WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE'S THIS HORRIBLE WITH MANY PEOPLE ADDICTED AND HAVING ISSUES. WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THAT AT THE TIME OF THE PRESCRIPTION NOT AFTER THE FACT IF IT INDIVIDUALS PRESCRIBED AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF AN OPIATE OR THE PRESCRIBED A BENZODIAZEPINE ON TOP OF AN OPIATE. WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THAT RIGHT AT THE TIME OF THE PRESCRIPTION AND SO WE DO CLINICAL WORK. FOR THOSE MEMBERS GET THEM INTO PAIN MANAGEMENT YOU KNOW FIND ALTERNATIVES FOR THEM AND DEAL DIRECTLY WITH THEIR PRESCRIBER IF THEY HAVE MULTIPLE PRESCRIBERS OF THE GOING TO MULTIPLE PHARMACIES WE GOT A DEAL WITH THAT IN THE MOMENT SO GETTING THE INFORMATION AFTERWARDS. DOESN'T REALLY HELP. SECOND AREA ARE REALLY HIGH IN COMPLICATED DRUGS I'M SURE MANY OF YOU HAVE SEEN THE ADS FOR K. TRUDA WHICH IS A VERY COMPLEX. IMMUNOMODULATOR DRUG THAT IS USED AS A PRIMARY TREATMENT FOR SOME CANCERS BUT OVERALL VERY GENERALLY AS A FINAL TREATMENT FOR CANCERS THAT ARE NOT RESPONDING NORMAL CHEMOTHERAPY. YOU HAVE TO MAKE ABSOLUTELY SURE IT'S THE RIGHT PRESCRIBER. THAT IT'S THE RIGHT MEDICINE FOR THE RIGHT PERSON THAT IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS DRUG VERY EFFECTIVE AND IN THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES AND SO AGAIN THAT'S GOT TO BE IN THE MOMENT THAT'S GOT TO BE RIGHT WITH THAT PRESCRIPTION HITS THE SYSTEM. AND THAT WOULD BE A PRIOR AUTH REQUIRED DRUG THAT WE THEN MAKE SURE THAT IT IS. PROBABLY A TERTIARY LEVEL ON COLLEGES THAT YOU KNOW UNIVERSITY BASED SYSTEM BECAUSE TO ME THAT DRUG NEEDS TO BE USED FOR THE RIGHT PEOPLE SO WE DO A LOT OF CLINICAL WORK RIGHT AT THE TIME OF THE PRESCRIPTION. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO PROTECT OUR MEMBERS -- IN TERMS OF RIGHT RIGHT MEMBER RIGHT PRESCRIBER RIGHT DRUG. JENNIFER CAN'T MENTIONED IS ACTUALLY FOR DIFFERENTLY. BUT AGAIN YOU DON'T WANT ANYBODY PRESCRIBING HABSI DRUGS ABOUT FORTY TO SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE TREATMENT. BY THE WAY QUE TRUTH AS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR THE TREATMENT. YOU WANT THAT DRUG TO BE PRESCRIBED IN ONE OF OUR CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE WHICH ARE TO COUNTY HOSPITALS LOMA LINDA OR YOU IN OUR UNIVERSITY BASED SYSTEM. YOU WANT THAT DRUG AND THAT CARE BEING DELIVERED AND THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT IS IF WE HAVE THE INFORMATION RIGHT AT THE POINT OF THE PRESCRIPTION. THIRD AREA DIABETES WE HAVE -- CENTER STONE IS WHAT WAS ON OUR BOARD WE HAVE A PAY FOR PERFORMANCE PROGRAM FOR PHARMACIES. WHERE THEY ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED WITH THE DIABETIC MEMBERS COMING INTO THE PHARMACY AROUND ARE THE ON THE RIGHT MEDICATIONS TO THE NEED TO CONSULT WITH A PHYSICIAN? OR THEY HAVE BEEN TESTED FOR THE DIABETES SO AGAIN IT'S GOT A WORKER AT THE TIME OF THE PRESCRIPTION. SO THE POINT I'M MAKING IS THAT WE ACTUALLY DO A LOT OF VERY CLINICAL WORK AROUND THE PHARMACY BENEFIT. AND I HAVE TO SAY IS A POSITION I SEE THE PHARMACY BENEFIT AS PART AND PARCEL OF DELIVERING HEALTHCARE TORE ONE POINT TWO FOUR MILLION MEMBERS. TO THE IDEA THAT YOU COULD PULL IT OUT AND DO IT SEPARATELY. TO ME I'M GONNA HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY WITH THAT BECAUSE OF THIS NEED TO BE ENGAGED AROUND THE TIME OF THE PRESCRIPTION. AND THE ABILITY TO WORK WITH THAT MEMBER AND TREATED APPROPRIATELY. SO YOU KNOW JUST JUST A COUPLE OF FINAL THOUGHTS. CANNOT DISAGREE AROUND STANDARDIZING THE BENEFIT THAT DR DOCTORS CRAZY MY BROTHER'S A PRACTICING PHYSICIAN. HE SAYS I GOT THIRTY FOUR MILLER'S SO HE ALWAYS GIVE ME A HARD TIME [inaudible] SO. BUT I THINK THERE ARE WAYS TO DO THAT WITHOUT NECESSARILY PULLING THE BENEFIT COMPLETELY OUT OF MANAGED CARE I THINK THERE ARE WAYS TO THINK ABOUT WAYS TO STANDARDIZE THE BENEFIT ACROSS THE STATE. AND YET STILL GIVE THAT CLINICAL ABILITY AT THE PLAN LEVEL TO ACTUALLY DEAL WITH OR ONE POINT TWO FOUR MILLION MEMBERS AND THE PHYSICIANS THAT WORK FOR THEM. SO FOR ME I'D REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THE PLANS AND THOSE OF US THE CARE SO DEEPLY ABOUT OUR MEMBERS AND PROVIDERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO GIVE INPUT. AND NOT NECESSARILY SEE THIS AS AN ALL OR NONE SCENARIO THAT THERE ARE WAYS TO THINK ABOUT IT WHERE YOU KEEP BOTH PARTS YOU KEEP STANDARDIZED BENEFIT. YOU YOU MAXIMIZE REBATES DON'T CARE GREAT LOVE THAT BUT YOU MAKE SURE THAT THE PLAN IS THE ABILITY TO ACTUALLY CARE FOR A MEMBERS WHICH IS WHAT I CARE ABOUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME MUCH APPRECIATED THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS GLAZER. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS BARBARA GLAZER WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING CALIFORNIANS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED HOSPITALS. CJ STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WHICH PROPOSES A NUMBER OF CHANGES AND INVESTMENTS TO MAKE HEALTHCARE MORE AFFORDABLE AND THEY'RE FROM ARE ACCESSIBLE FOR MORE CALIFORNIANS HIS BUDGET CONTINUES TO MAKE PROGRESS TOWARD UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE LOCAL SHARED BY ALL OF THIS. DRIVING THE PUSH TOWARD AFFORDABILITY THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER TO CREATE A SINGLE PURCHASER SYSTEM PERFORMANCE TYPICAL THING CALIFORNIA IS AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO LOWER THE COST OF DRUGS ONE OF THE FASTEST RISING COSTS IN HEALTHCARE TODAY. THE GOVERNOR'S CJ'S COMMITTED TO FINDING MORE WAYS TO LOWER THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. AT THE STATE AND STATE AS THE STATE AND STAKEHOLDERS DEVELOPING NEW BULL PURCHASING ARRANGEMENT WE ASK THAT THEY KEEP IN MIND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA'S SAFETY NET HOSPITALS. AND COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS THAT PARTICIPATE IN THE THREE FORTY B. DRUG PRICING DISCOUNT PROGRAM FOR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS. CONGRESS CREATEDTHE THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO TO ENABLE SAFETY NET HOSPITALS AND COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS. TO STRETCH SCARCE FEDERAL RESOURCES AS FAR AS POSSIBLE REACHING MORE ELIGIBLE PATIENTS AND PROVIDE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES. IN CALIFORNIA MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY HOSPITAL'S PARTICIPATE IN AND RELY ON THE THREE FORTY B. DRUG DISCOUNT PROGRAM TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES. IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR THREE FORTY BE A HOSPITAL MUST BE EITHER NONPROFIT OR PUBLICLY OWNED. CAM TO SERVE A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PATIENTS. THE THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM DOES JUST THAT HOSPITALS AND COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS ARE STRETCHING SCARCE FEDERAL RESOURCES TO EXPAND ACCESS. AT HOSPITALS THIS MEANS MORE ACCESS TO ONCOLOGY SERVICES THE ABILITY TO OFFER MOBILE IN PRIMARY CARE CLINICS PROVIDE DIABETES SCREENINGS AND OPERATE HIV CLINICS. THESE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES REACH TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND IMPROVE PATIENT OUTCOMES SUPPORT MEDICATION ADHERENCE AND REDUCE THE OUR ADMISSIONS. FOR SOME OF OUR SMALLER IN RURAL MEMBERS PARTICIPATING IN THE THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM CAN LITERALLY MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STAYING OPEN AND CLOSING THEIR DOORS. IN RELATION TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT UNDER THREE FORTY BE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE HOSPITALS IN PRE STANDING CANCERS CENTERS ARE ACTUALLY PROHIBITED FROM PARTICIPATING IN A GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATION ALSO CALL THE GPO. THE LANGUAGE IN THE EXECUTIVE ORDER COULD BE INTERPRETED TO DEFINE CALIFORNIA AS THE GPO. IF THIS WERE THE CASE THESE HOSPITALS WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE THREE FORTY BE PROGRAM ALTOGETHER. LOSING ANY ABILITY TO PURCHASE DRUGS AT A DISCOUNTED RATE FOR COMMERCIAL UNINSURED AND MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES NOT JUST FOR MEDI CAL ENROLLEES. IF THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS SEEM TO BE GPO THE HOSPITAL'S MOST IMPACT WILL BE THOSE TREATING THE LARGEST PROPORTION OF MEDI CAL PATIENTS. THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS WILL PROHIBIT THESE HOSPITALS FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM AND THEY MAY BE FORCED TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE VITAL PATIENT CARE SERVICES. AND ACCESS TO FREE OR DISCOUNTED DRUGS FOR THEIR PATIENTS. WE UNDERSTAND THAT IS PART OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES IS PREPARING A REPORT AS IT PERTAINS TO BOTH PHARMACEUTICAL PURCHASING FRAMEWORK. DUE TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN MAY OF THIS SPRING ADDITIONALLY WE UNDERSTAND THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS PREPARING A COMPLETE REPORT IS IT RELATES TO THE TRANSITION OF PHARMACY SERVICES. FULLY TO THE P. PER SERVICE BENEFIT. BY JULY TWELFTH. TWENTY NINETEEN AS BOTH DEPARTMENTS PREPARE THESE REPORTS WE OFFER SEVERAL FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS WE HOPE THEY WILL CONSIDER. WILL THE STATE PURCHASE THE DRUGS MANAGE THE INVENTORY AND HAVE THEM SHIPPED TO HOSPITALS WILL HOSPITALS HAVE TO KEEP SEPARATE DRUG INVENTORIES FOR MEDI CAL PATIENTS ANOTHER. WELL THE TRANSITION OF THE PHARMACY BENEFIT FOR MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE TO MEDI CAL PEEPERS SERVICE SUPPLY TO ALL DRUGS. INCLUDING THOSE ADMINISTERED BY A PHYSICIAN AND HOSPITAL INPATIENT OUTPATIENT SETTING OR WILL THE CAR ABOUT ONLY APPLY TO THOSE DISPENSED BY A PHARMACY. EITHER WAY IT WILL IMPACT. THREE FOR HOWEVER THE BILLING COMPLEXITIES ARE FAR GREATER IF THE CHANGES APPLIED TO DRUGS AND MINISTER IN IN PATIENT AND OUT PATIENT SETTINGS. UNDER THE MEDI CAL PAPERS SERVICE CARVE OUT BENEFIT STRUCTURE FOR MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE BENEFICIARIES WHO WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR CARE COORDINATION MEDICATION ADHERENCE AND UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT. AND THEN LASTLY WILL THERE BE THOUGHT GIVEN TO THE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AND SERVICES CURRENTLY FUNDED BY THE THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM. IF SO IS THE LEGISLATURE CONTEMPLATING HOW TO FILL THE SIZEABLE FUNDING GAP SO THAT MEDI CL PATIENTS DON'T EXPERIENCE ACCESS AND SERVICE CHALLENGES AS A RESULT OF THIS PROPOSAL. C. H. A. STANDS READY TO WORK WITH THE STATE AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO CREATE A DRUG DISCOUNT PROGRAM WHOSE GOAL IS TO LOWER HEALTHCARE COSTS FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA. WE WOULD LIKE TO PARTNER WITH THIS STATE AND THIS PROPOSAL IS DEVELOPED. TO ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA'S CRITICAL SAFETY NET HOSPITALS IN COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO DELIVER THE ESSENTIAL SERVICES THEY DO TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. THANK YOU EVERYONE MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY FIRST AND FOREMOST A SHORTLIST X. SENIOR DIRECTOR OF HEALTH POLICY AT PARMA. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE TODAY SO WE REALLY SEE THIS -- HAVING TO ASPECTS AS WE'VE HEARD FROM OTHER PANELISTS THE FIRST BEING THE MOVE TO FEE FOR SERVICE FROM MANAGED CARE FOR THE PHARMACY BENEFIT WE REALLY SEE THIS AS A REINSTATEMENT OF THE PHARMACY BENEFIT FOR THE ENTIRE POPULATION THAT WAS USED AROUND SEVEN YEARS AGO IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHERE THEY STATE MANAGES THE PREFERRED DRUG LIST AND ALSO GETS THE SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES IN ADDITION TO THAT STATUTORY REBATES -- OUR PRIORITIES WITH MEDI CAL OR TO ENSURE A TRANSPARENT NEGOTIATION PROCESS AND ENSURE THAT PATIENTS HAVE ACCESS. TO THE MEDICINES THAT THEY NEED WE HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE AT THIS TIME THAT THE DEPARTMENT CHAIRS -- DOES NOT SHARE IN THOSE -- PARTY OR CONCERNS WITH THAT PART OF THE PROPOSAL -- WITH REGARD TO BALK PURCHASING OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES HAS THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO DO THIS ALREADY -- AND AGAIN WHERE WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL YET WERE MORE LIKELY TO REMAIN NEUTRAL AND THAT. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME AND SPEAK WITH YOU ALL TODAY [inaudible] Q.. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS -- JOHN ROSS I'M THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE CALIFORNIA PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION. OUR MEMBERS SERVE THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA THROUGH A VARIETY OF PRACTICE SETTINGS INCLUDING COMMUNITY PHARMACIES STATE IN PUBLIC COSTING PRIVATE HOSPITALS CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES IN A VARIETY OF OTHER SPECIALTY PRACTICE SETTINGS -- I APPRECIATE DIRECTOR CANCER TO CHELATION OF OF SOMEWHAT SEPARATING THE ISSUES BETWEEN THE TRANSITION IF YOU FOR SERVICE AND THE BOOK PURCHASING AND LIKE TO REFLECT MY COMMENTS IN THAT SAME MANNER. SEPTA STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER AND BUDGET PROPOSAL TO TRANSITION ALL PHARMACY SERVICES FOR MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE. TO FEE FOR SERVICE -- BY JANUARY. TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE BELIEVE THIS ACTION A CORRESPONDING BUDGET PROPOSAL WILL ENHANCE THE PHARMACY SERVICES AVAILABLE TO MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES. WILL RESULT IN GREATER SAVINGS TO THE STATE TO CARE FOR THE BENEFICIARIES. FROM THE BENEFICIARY PERSPECTIVE CPA TO BELIEVES A SHIFT TO FEE FOR SERVICE WILL INCREASE ACCESS TO CARE -- AS WAS MENTIONED BY DIRECTOR CAN'T BECAUSE 97% OF PHARMACIES CURRENTLY PARTICIPATE IN THE FEE FOR SERVICE PROGRAM. ON THE OTHER HAND -- PHARMACIST ROUTINELY EXPERIENCE CONCERNS WITH A NUMBER OF MANAGED CARE ENTITIES VIEWS CONTRACTORS PBM TO ADMINISTER THE PHARMACY BENEFITS BECAUSE AN INCREASING TREND TOWARD NARROW PROVIDER NETWORKS WITHIN THIS MANAGED CARE SERVICE AREAS. THESE NARROW NETWORKS DISADVANTAGED BENEFICIARIES FOR REDUCING ACCESS AND CHOICE OF PHARMACY PROVIDERS. AND CREATE IMPEDIMENTS FOR NAVIGATING CARE. UNDER A SINGLE FEE FOR SERVICE SYSTEM BENEFICIARIES AND PROVIDERS ALIKE ARE BETTER ABLE TO COORDINATE CARE. ANY AND COVERAGE AND ENSURE THAT PATIENTS ARE ABLE TO RECEIVE THEIR MEDICATIONS. I WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION TO USE EXISTING MEDI CAL FEE FOR SERVICE PHARMACY CLAIMS ADJUDICATION A PROVIDER NETWORK MODEL THROUGH DHS AND IS FISCAL INTERMEDIARY. WE WOULD NOT BE IN SUPPORT OF A STATE PROGRAM THAT ADOPTED A MODEL WHERE THESE FUNCTIONS WERE OUTSOURCED TO A THIRD PARTY NAMELY A PVM. IN THOSE MANAGEDCARE PLANS THAT USE PEAVEY AMPS FOR THEIR PHARMACY BENEFIT ADMINISTRATION. OUR MEMBERS REPORT FREQUENT CHALLENGES AND FRUSTRATIONS WITH CONTRACT PROVISIONS FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CLAIMS PROCESSING CHALLENGES. CONVERSELY PHARMACISTS ARE GENERALLY PLEASED WITH -- AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE BENEFIT. FROM A PRIVATE PROVIDER PERSPECTIVE WOULD WELCOME THE ENTIRE STATE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PHARMACY BENEFIT TO FOLLOW THE EXISTING MODEL. NOW FURTHER AS IT RELATES TO THE STREAMLINING OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROCUREMENT FORMULAE MANAGEMENT PROCESS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION SHOULD CONSIDER FORMALIZING A CALIFORNIA PHARMACY COLLABORATIVE FOR ANOTHER STRUCTURE. THAT REQUIRES ALL STATE FUNDED AGENCIES TO COURTNEY PROCUREMENT OF MEDICATIONS AND ESTABLISHED A SINGULAR CONTRACT A DRUG LIST RATHER THAN THE VOLUNTARY SYSTEM IN SOME CASES THAT'S IN PLACE TODAY. DOING SO WE DO BELIEVE WOULD ACHIEVE THE ADMINISTRATION'S GOAL IN THE EXECUTIVE ORDER OF LEVERAGING MAXIMUM SAVINGS -- VIA A SINGLE POINT OF CONTROL ADMINISTRATION THROUGH A STATE AGENCY. AND WITHOUT THAT -- SINGLE POINT OF CONTROL WE BELIEVE THAT THERE WILL BE -- DOLLARS THAT WILL BE LEFT ON THE TABLE -- AND NOT CULTIVATED BY THE STATE IN TERMS OF SAVINGS. FINALLY WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THAT SINGLE SOURCE -- POINT OF CONTRACT WOULD RESULT IN GREATER TRANSPARENCY IN HOW ALL AGENCIES OPERATOR PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE AS WELL AS PROCUREMENT. FINALLY AS ADMINISTRATION LOOKS TO ADVANCE THIS PROPOSAL WE BELIEVE ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS ARE NECESSARY AS BEEN RAISED HERE ON THIS PANEL. TO ENSURE ACCESS AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT FOR HIGH COST SPECIALTY MEDICATIONS AN ALLOWANCE FOR THE THREE FORTY BE CONTRACTED DRUG PROGRAM. THESE ARE JUST A FEW THE COMPLICATIONS AND IMPORTANT BENEFITS THAT WE STAND READY TO ASSIST. AS THIS PROPOSAL MOVES FORWARD THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE ANY QUESTIONS [inaudible] DOCTOR PAN. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. APPRECIATE THE UP PRESENTATIONS. I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS OUT THERE -- AND SAID OF C. DRUG -- DELIVERY AND ACCESS IS. OCCASIONS SAYS THIS OF A COMPLEX SO -- OR TWO IN OUR BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THE THREE FORTY BE -- IF THERE ARE GOING TO BE -- DECREASES AND AND AND FUNDING THERE HOW WE BACK FILLING THAT -- WE NEED TO LOOK AT SAID NOT ALL THE MEDICATIONS AS WE GO THROUGH A AN OUTPATIENT PHARMACY WE HAVE FIGURE OUT MEDICATIONS BECAUSE IT FACILITIES PROVIDER PROVIDED. AND OF COURSE -- IN SOME SENSES -- THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE BUT THIS IS ALL THIS COULD DEAL WITH ON A RESULT IN A BACKWARD STEP IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY COORDINATION OF CARE AND AND VALUE BASED PURCHASING APPROACHES WHICH IS REALLY THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO REALLY BEND OUT COST CURVE. LONG RUN AND SO -- YOU KNOW -- IS A DOG THESE PHARMACEUTICALS WORK THEY ACTUALLY NAM THEY'VE BEEN TESTED THEY'VE BEEN APPROVED BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE. SO -- THAT MEANS THAT ANY SORT OF SYSTEM YOU CREATE TO BETTER MANAGE CARE -- IF THEY'RE CARVED OUT -- AND THEY'RE NOT CORNING WITH THE REST OF THE PIECES THAT YOU KNOW THAT ABOUT THIS THAT -- I'LL PROVIDERS THAT FACILITIES ETCETERA THEN WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE KIND OF RESULTS WE NEED SO I APPRECIATE THE RESENTATION FROM -- FROM HEALTH PLAN ABOUT GONNA AFFECTIVELY USE. MEDICATION -- THAT HAS TO BE PART OF THE MIX AND IN FACT ACTUALLY FROM A VALUE BASED PURCHASING POINT OF VIEW. WE CAN'T THINK ABOUT ANY AS MUCH AS EVERYONE'S ANXIOUS ABOUT YOU KNOW THE CONCERNED ABOUT PHARMACEUTICAL CLASS WE CAN'T NESTLE SEPARATE THAT OUT FROM EVERYTHING ELSE I MEAN WE HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW DO WE GET THE BEST VALUE OVER ALL. RIGHT -- SO -- CERTAINLY I THINK WHEN WE LOOK AT PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES YOU KNOW IN ISOLATION THERE'S CERTAINLY A LOT OF EXAMPLES WE CAN GIVE WHERE THERE ARE CHALLENGES WHERE -- PEOPLE UNFORTUNATELY SOME PEOPLE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE PATIENTS WHO NEED THESE MEDICATIONS AND AND OF THE RAISE PRICES. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT -- THAT SOMETIMES -- ACTUALLY TO LOWER THE UTILIZATION OF OTHER TYPES OF SERVICES AS WELL AND THAT -- WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW THE HOW TO CREATE A STRUCTURE WHERE -- THOSE TRADEOFFS -- END UP WITH A NET LOWER COSTS FOR THE PATIENT RIGHT I MEAN AND THAT'S IN THE END AS IS WHAT IT'S ABOUT IS ABOUT WHAT THE PATIENTS HAVE TO PAY. TO RIGHT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT WHAT'S THE PRICE RATE IT'S ACTUALLY WHAT THE PATIENTS HAVE TO PAY SO -- YOU CAN HAVE A LOWER PRICE BUT IF YOU A MECHANISM THAT EITHER DENIES THE PATIENT ACCESS OR THAT ACTUALLY RAISES THEIR OUT OF POCKET COSTS THAN THAT'S NOT HELPING THE PATIENT EITHER. AND NOW THAT'S LESS OF AN ISSUE IN MEDI CAL LAWYER -- THERE'S A BUT I MEAN THAT'S AGAIN WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT HOW THAT STRUCTURE OVERALL BECAUSE SOME OF THESE SOME OF THE EFFECTS MAY AFFECT ALSO NOT JUST PATIENTS A MEDI CAL BUT OTHER PEOPLE USE SIMILAR FACILITIES I THINK WAS POINTED OUT BY THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. SO I LOOK FORWARD I APPRECIATE THAT -- THAT THAT ARE -- DIRECTOR DIRECTED THAT THE DIRECTIVE DTS IS STILL SITTING IN THE AUDIENCE. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING -- SUBCOMMITTEE AND SO I KNOW THERE'S A STILL A LOT OF THINGS TO WORK ABOUT -- WORK OUT BUT WE DEFINITELY WANT -- TO YOU'LL BE VERY INTERESTED IN HOW THESE ISSUES WILL BE RESOLVED MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY PROCEED WITH AN OPEN IT UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT. BOTTOM CHAIR MEMBERS SERRA FLOCKS CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION -- I WANT TO SPEAK TO THAT THE BULK PURCHASING A PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND I WANT TO SPEAK ACTUALLY -- TO NOT THE MEDI CAL PIECE OF IT BUT TO THE STATE AND PRIVATE PURCHASERS. THERE ARE SEVENTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS THAT HAVE JOB BASED COVERAGE SIX MILLION OF THOSE ARE IN SELF INSURED PLANS -- WHERE THEIR EMPLOYER OR TRUST FUND PURCHASE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS? AND THIS IS A HUGE COST BOTH TO CONSUMERS TO WORKERS AND TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CALPERS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN SAID THAT THE RISING COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. ACCOUNTED 4405% OF THEIR PREMIUM RATE INCREASES -- A HUGE COST TO BOTH THE STATE AND TO TWO MEMBERS. SO ALONG THOSE LINES ATION AS TGS DOES THE REPORTS OF IS THERE A WAY TO REMOVE THE BARRIERS SO THAT THERE COULD BE. ACTUAL STATE PURCHASING THAT THE MEDIC CAL AND STATE AND PRIVATE PURCHASERS. COULD BE IN ONE BULK POOL I'M IN ORDER TO HAVE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF PURCHASING LEVERAGE -- AND THEN I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ALIGN MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS OF SENDER STONE I THINK LOOKING AT EITHER A STATE RUN PBM OR NONPROFIT PBM HAS HUGE AMOUNT OF POTENTIALS -- TO BE THE SOLE SUPPLIER OF ALL PURCHASERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S NOT UNUSUAL IT'S WITH THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION DOES AS WELL AS THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA -- AND LASTLY I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WE AS A STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE AN INCREDIBLE RESOURCE SB SEVENTEEN BECAME A LAW THAT IS THE FIRST IN THE NATION DRUG TRANSPARENCY -- LAW WHERE DRUG COMPANIES ACTUALLY HAVE TO REPORT AND GIVE A JUSTIFICATION FOR THEIR EXCESSIVE PRICE INCREASES THAT IS GOING TO YIELD A WEALTH OF DATA THAT I THINK CAN HELP INFORM ANY KIND OF STATE PURCHASING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATED NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY TO THE FIRST PART OF THE AGENDA RELATED TO AT TO HEALTH FOR ALL YOUNG ADULTS WE APPRECIATE. AYE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO EXPAND FULL SCOPE MEDI CAL UP IT SIMILAR. TO A CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER AND HOW THE AXIS URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER EXPANDING COVERAGE TO ALL ADULTS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS. I TO THE SECOND PART WE APPRECIATE OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- TO LOOK AT COST CONTAINMENT OFFICIAL POSITION BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF AREAS THIS PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE. THAT FEE FOR SERVICE -- UP BY PHARMACY SERVICES SPECIFICALLY ANY CAR ABOUT SHOULD RECOGNIZE THE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION PROCESS. AND NARROWLY HAS UNDERGONE AS IN MANAGED CARE ENROLLEE AND PROVIDE CONTINUITY OF CARE PROTECTIONS FOR TWELVE MONTHS. A TO ENSURE INDIVIDUALS WITH MULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS DO NOT SUDDENLY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING NEEDED PRESCRIPTIONS WE RECOMMEND DH CS ELIMINATE THE SIX MONTH DRUG PER MONTH. SOFT CAP ON IN IN THE TREATMENT AUTHORIZATION PROCESS AND IN ADDITION WITH THE TREATMENT AUTHORIZATION REQUEST PROCESSING SIMILAR TO AN MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS WE BELIEVE THAT TIME LINE. SHOULD BE APPLIED OF THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS THERE'S NOT CURRENTLY A PROCESSING TIMELINE ON THE THE TREATMENT AUTHORIZATION REQUEST PROCESS. AND FINALLY -- WE BELIEVE AN EXTERNAL APPEAL PROCESS SIMILAR TO THE INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW WHERE A POSITION IS -- PROVIDING THAT THE EXTERNAL REVIEW AS WELL AS THE THE SIMILAR TIME LINES SHOULD BE FOLLOWED IN TERMS OF DUE PROCESS RIGHTS. FOR ENROLLEES THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. THANK YOU TURN MEMBERS LINDA TENER WHAT'S ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK -- WE CONTINUE IN RESPONSE TO PART A OF THE HEARING -- WE CONTINUE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE CHILLING EFFECT THAT PUBLICCHARGE HAS ALREADY HAD ON AND UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY MEMBERS -- ANECDOTALLY WE'VE HEARD HEARTBREAKING STORY FOR GOING THEIR HEALTHCARE AND PULLING OUT OF THE MEDI CAL SYSTEM. ON TO ECHO THE REMARKS OF SENATOR BELL -- WEEDING OUT REACH IS CRITICAL TO HELPING COMMUNITIES UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR AND HOW TO USE THEIR COVERAGE -- I ALSO HEARD CONCERNS FROM DOCTOR PAN ABOUT THE INFLUX OF EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS THAT COME% WITH THE EXPANSION. OF BECAUSE PEOPLE JUST HAVEN'T BEEN ACCUSTOMED -- TO GOING ANYWHERE ELSE OTHER THAN THE ER -- THAT IS ALL TO SAY THAT WE SEE AN OPPORTUNITY OF FOR THE STATE TO INVEST IN COMMUNITY BASED OUT REACH AND ROME AND NAVIGATION SERVICES. TO REALLY HELP THE HARDEST TO REACH COMMUNITY MEMBERS -- THIS* PROGRAM WAS ACTUALLY PREVIOUSLY FUNDED -- THROUGH AB AT TWO WHICH HAS SIX SINCE EXPIRED IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND WE FIND NOW MORE THAN EVER WE REALLY NEED TO REINVEST IN THE SERVICES -- TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL FOLKS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR AND HOW TO USE THEIR COVERAGE IN LIKE A FEDERAL AND TAXES FASTER ESPECIALLY PUBLIC CHARGE. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. HI GOOD AFTERNOON KEREN MEMBERS I'M LIZ A SECURE WITH THE CALIFORNIA OUT PLUS ADVOCATES AN AFFILIATE OF THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION. WHO REPRESENTS? THIRTEEN THIRTEEN HUNDRED THIRTY CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS AND SIX POINT NINE MILLION HEALTH CENTER PATIENTS. HEALTH CENTER SITES ARE SPREAD ALL OVER THE STATE AND WE'RE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES -- BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO SHARE OUR SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNOR'S DIVISION TO REFORM THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM PROVIDE AFFORDABLE COVERAGE AN AXIS. AND LOWER THE TOTAL HEALTH CARE SPENT -- THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER CREATES A SINGLE PERSON OR SAYS THE PURCHASER SYSTEM FOR DRUGS IN CALIFORNIA. AND ITS WE UNDERSTAND IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF HIS VISION. HOWEVER THE EXECUTIVE ORDER DIRECTS THE A CS TRANSITION ALL PHARMACY SERVICES FOR MEDICAL MANAGED CARE TO FEE FOR SERVICE WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY AND THE SAVINGS HEALTH CENTERS ACCRUED THROUGH THE THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM. AND ULTIMATELY LIMIT THE ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIA'S LOW INCOME GOING TO PULL COMMUNITIES. THE THREE FORTY BE SAVINGS. PROGRAM ALLOWS HEALTH CENTERS TO HAVE IN HOUSE PHARMACIES WITH EXTENDED HOURS -- OFFER TRAVEL VOUCHERS FOR PATIENTS AND PROVIDE FREE DRUGS TO THE HOMELESS -- AMONG OTHER VERY NEEDED SERVICES WHICH WITHOUT THIS FUNDING COULD BE VERY MUCH CUT. WE REMAIN COMMITTED AND WILLING TO PARTNER TO FIND A SOLUTION WHICH INCLUDES EXPRESS PROVISIONS PROTECT HEALTH HEALTH CENTERS ARE CURRENTLY OPERATE THREE FORTY B. DRUG THIS COMPARABLE. WHO STAND TO LOSE FUNDS THAT FULLY GO TO SUPPORT THE SAFETY NET? OUR GOAL IS TO PARTNER WITH THE STATE AS THEY DEVELOP THIS PROPOSAL WITH THE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT HEALTH CENTERS CAN CONTINUE TO DELIVER THE LEVEL AND SCOPE OF SERVICES TEY DO TODAY. WHICH IS PARTIALLY FUNDED BY THREE FORTY BE -- AND THEN GOING BACK -- TO THE FIRST PART OF THE HEARING -- WE WANT TO ALSO SHARE OUR FULL SUPPORT FOR EXPANDING AHMED ACCOUNT TO ALL THE DOLLS -- AND ALSO WANTED TO ECHO ON THERE'S ISSUES WITH PUBLIC CHARTS THAT HOUSE CENTERS HAVE BEEN SEEING WITHIN THEIR PATIENTS. THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. KELLY BROOKS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS -- FIRST I'D LIKE TO EXPRESS THE ASSOCIATION SUPPORT FOR EXPANDING -- HEALTH COVERAGE IN CALIFORNIA AND WE LIKE TO ENCOURAGE THE ADMINISTRATION THE LEGISLATURE -- TO WORK WITH COUNTIES TO MAKE SURE THE FINANCING PORTION OF THIS DOESN'T ADVERSELY A PAT AFFECT ON PUBLIC HEALTH AN INDIGENT SERVICES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- ON THE SECOND PART OF THE HEARING -- WE WOULD ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S EFFORTS TO REDUCE PHARMACY COSTS BUT WANT TO NOTE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE THREE FORTY BE. TO SAFETY NET PROVIDERS AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PHARMACY PROPOSAL. I WOULD KNOW THAT ALL PUBLIC -- HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS ARE ELIGIBLE THREE FORTY BE PROVIDERS -- THE PROPOSAL TO BOTH LEVERAGE THE PART THE GROUP PURCHASING AND TO MOVE PHARMACY THE PHARMACY BENEFIT FROM A MANAGED CARE TO FEE FOR SERVICE -- COULD JEOPARDIZE THE BENEFIT THAT WE RECEIVED TODAY AT THREE FORTY BE. WE ARE USING THE DRUG DISCOUNTS TODAY TO PROVIDE BETTER ACCESS TO DRUGS FOR ALL OF OUR PATIENTS AND ADMINISTER CRITICAL PROGRAMS THAT PATIENTS MAY NOT FIND ELSEWHERE INCLUDING -- HEPATITIS C. HEMOPHILIACS SERVICE SAYS FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. AS A STATE FURTHER EXPLORES WAYS TO REDUCE DRUG COSTS WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE PROVIDING THESE IMPORTANT SERVICES AND MITIGATE ANY POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THREE FORTY PROVIDERS. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. HI KATHY BURKE WITH THE HEALTH OFFICER'S ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA FOR SOMEONE ALIGN MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS MICHELLE GIVENS MADE -- ABOUT THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS DO WITH THEIR FUNDING. AND I ALSO WANT TO MENTION ABOUT THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG -- COSTS THAT WE WERE THRILLED WHEN THE DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES ASKED US WHAT DRUGS ARE THE MOST EXPENSIVE TO US THAT THEY CAN BE INCLUDED. IN THE LIST BUT WE ALSO WANT TO ADD THAT ANOTHER IMPORTANT COMPONENT IS THE DRUGS ACOSTA ZERO BECAUSE WE'RE THERE TOO EXPENSIVE FOR US TO EVEN BY. THE ONES THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD. A KEY EXAMPLE OF THAT IS ADULT IMMUNIZATIONS THAT WE WOULD LOVE OUR COMMUNITY PROVIDERS TO HAVE IN THEIR OFFICES BECAUSE PATIENTS ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE AN IMMUNIZATION IF IT'S RIGHT THERE -- AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO PURCHASE OF OTHER WAYS AND IT'S DIFFICULT FOR PROVIDERS TO KEEP THOSE IN STOCK THANK YOU. BARBARA GLAZER WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT C. H. A FULLY SUPPORTS THE EXPANSION OF THE FULL SCOPE MEDI CAL BENEFITS TO THE YOUNG UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS -- THIS WILL CERTAINLY GO A LONG WAY IN IMPROVING ACCESS TO CARE FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS. AND HELP TO KEEP THAT CARE MORE AFFORDABLE THANK YOU THANK YOU FINAL WITNESS. AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ON PREDNISOLONE I'M HERE ON BEHALF THE ASSOCIATION FOR ACCESSIBLE MEDICINES A AM REPRESENTS THE GENERIC AND BIOSIMILAR. MANUFACTURERS AND ALL THE PRE FIGHT. THANKS FOR ALLOWING MEIN STAYING AROUND FOR THE THE LAST PERSON TO TESTIFY WE DO BELIEVE THAT GENERIC ABOUT SIMILAR TO OUR LARGE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE AND WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S. GOAL TO REDUCE PATIENT CO. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF POINTS I'D I'D I WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH. 90% OF ALL PRESCRIPTIONS WRITTEN ARE FORTUNATE -- DRUGS ONLY 23% OF THE REVENUE RESULTS FROM. THOSE PRESCRIPTIONS AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN GENERIC DRUGS SAY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TWENTY THREE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. IT'S FOUR POINT SEVEN BILLION A MEDICAID SEVEN POINT SIX BILLION A MEDICARE. AND THE THE REST IN COMMERCIALLY INSURED AND CASH PAYING THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE BRAND MARKET PLACE IN THE CHIN GENERIC MARKETPLACE ARE VERY STARK. WE SELL ON A VERY NATIONAL LEVEL THERE'S THREE PURCHASERS THAT BY ARE THE THREE WHOLESALERS AFTER THAT THE GENERIC MANUFACTURERS ARE VERY LARGELY OUT OF THE COST STRUCTURE THAT CONTINUES THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN. IN FACT MANUFACTURES TAKE IN THE GENERIC SPACE ABOUT ONE THIRD. OF THE REVENUE WHILE THE REST THE SUPPLY CHAIN TAKES TWO THIRDS. THE DIFFERENCE ON THE BRAND SITE IS THE BRAND MANUFACTURERS TAKE ABOUT 75% OF THE REVENUE AND THE REST SPREAD ACROSS THE SUPPLY CHAIN. THE GENERIC PHARMACEUTICAL SPACES ABOUT THE ONLY DECLINING. SPACE WITH IN HEALTH CARE WERE DECLINING AT ABOUT 7% ANNUALLY. I THINK FIVE EARLIER SB SEVENTEEN WAS WAS BROUGHT UP AND I THINK SOME VERY INTERESTING POINTS HAVE ALREADY RESULTED FROM THAT BILL OF THE TWENTY FIVE MOST FREQUENTLY PRESCRIBED GENERIC DRUGS. THEY COMPRISE THIRTY NINE POINT POINT 8%. OF THE TOTAL DRUG SPEND AN ONLY POINT 3%. OF THE PREMIUM FOR TWENTY FIVE HIGHEST PER YEAR. A YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASED GENERIC DRUGS RESULTED IN ONLY FOUR POINT 7% OF THE TOTAL DRUG SPENT. AND YES THERE ARE SOME VERY EXPENSIVE GENERIC DRUGS I DON'T WANT -- TO DOWNPLAYS FAT FACT. THE FINAL POINT THAT CAME OUT OF THE THE DRUG LISTA REQUIRED FROM THE INFORMATION FROM THE INSURERS SUPPORT FOR THE TWENTY FIVE MOST COSTLY GENERIC DRUGS. SO RESULTED IN 25% OF ALL PRESCRIPTIONS. BELOW 8% OF THE TOTAL DRUG SPEND AND LESS THAN 1% OF HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS. THE CENTER FOR CMS NATIONAL HEALTH EXPENDITURE DATA FROM -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN SHOWS THAT HOSPITAL EXPENDITURES INCREASED BY FOUR POINT 6% TO APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT ONE TRILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE THE PRIOR YEAR WAS A FIVE POINT 6% INCREASE. POSITIONING CLINICAL SERVICES INCREASED FOUR POINT 2% TO APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS ALSO GOOD BECAUSE THAT'S REDUCTION FROM FIVE POINT 6%. THE PRIOR YEAR PRESCRIPTION DRUG SPEND INCREASED. POINT 4%. TWO THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS AGAIN THESE ARE CMS. NUMBERS. THEY CREDITED LARGELY THE GENERIC DRUG SPACE FOR ENSURING THAT LOW. INCREASE POINT 4%. REGARDING THE PURCHASING POOL AS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR. AM DOES NOT TAKE A POSITION ON ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT AGAIN BECAUSE MOST GENERICS ARE. SOLD TO THE THREE WHOLESALERS BUT WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS AND IT'S KIND OF A LONG RANGE CONCERNED WITH THIS TYPE OF THING AND WHEN WE'VE SEEN THIS -- GROWTH FROM STATE TO STATE TO THE NATIONAL LEVEL [inaudible] AND THE CONCERN IS AS YOU START TO GROW THE PURCHASING POOLS. THAT MEANS YOU'RE ELIMINATING THE NUMBER OF PURCHASERS WHEN YOU ELIMINATE THE NUMBER OF PURCHASERS YOU'RE ELIMINATING A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL SALES. WHEN YOU LIMóN EIGHT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SALES THAT MEANS THAT THERE'S NOT AS MANY MANUFACTURERS WHO ARE GOING TO BE MAKING THOSE SALES? AND SO THAT STARTS TO NARROW. THE XIN ROUTE AND IT'S THE COMPETITION WITHIN THE GENERIC SPACE THAT DRIVE DOWN PRICES. AND SO. AGAIN IT'S IT'S NOT ANY SORT OF OPPOSITION BUT JUST A THOUGHT TO LEAVE YOU WITH. THAT. THERE ARE SOME LONG RANGE CONCERNS THAT I THINK NEED TO BE. CONTEMPLATED AS THIS TYPE OF A PROPOSAL MOVES FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU ARE COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- PANELISTS MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE -- FOR STICKING WITH US AND HAVING A IMPORTANT FIRST CONVERSATION ABOUT SOME MAJOR -- EXPANSIONS IN THE GOVERNOR'S -- BUDGET PROPOSAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE HEARING IS ADJOURNED
