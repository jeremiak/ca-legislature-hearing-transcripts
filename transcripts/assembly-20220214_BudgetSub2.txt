ALTHOUGH TODAY'S HEARING IS FOCUSED ON INVESTMENTS IN THE UC CSU AND CALIFORNIA ME COLLEGES THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO PROPOSES SEVERAL FINANCIAL AID INVESTMENTS THAT WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS INTENDED THESE INSTITUTIONS. WITHOUT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE DAN THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON- DAN OR TO PREVENT A FINANCE- I WILL NOT TURN TO THE INVESTMENT INCLUDED AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AS MENTIONED EARLIER BOTTOM MY COLLEAGUE THE CCC MULTI A ROAD MAP BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE FOCUSES ON EQUITY AND STUDENT SUCCESS. IN UPON THE SYSTEM'S VISION FOR SUCCESS THE ROADMAP ESTABLISHES SHARED EXPECTATIONS AN AMBITIOUS GOALS. INVESTING AVAILABLE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RESOURCES FOR THE COLLEGES TO SUPPORT THESE EFFORTS AND EXPANDING CHAPTERS OFFICE CAPACITY. TO BETTER SUPPORT COLLEGES IN MEETING THESE GOALS. IN PARTICULAR THE MULTIROOM APP FOCUSES ON GOALS RELATED TO INTERSEGMENT OF COLLABORATION. FOR TIMELY TRANSFER REDUCING TIME 2 DEGREES CLOSING EQUITY GAPS AND IMPROVING ALIGNED WITH K. TWELVE IN WORKFORCE NEEDS. TURNED OUT TO THE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE IN THE BUDGET THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES THE STATUTORY COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT OF FIVE POINT 33% EIGHT IN ADDRESSING CONTINUED ENROLLMENT DECLINES ACROSS THE SYSTEM. ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND IS INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FIRMAMENT OUTREACH AND STUDENT RETENTION EFFORTS. BUILDING ON THE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION PROVIDED LAST YEAR. FURTHER TO MEET THE DIVERSE LEARNING MODALITY DEMANDS OF THE STATE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. THE BUDGET INCLUDES AN EXPECTATION THAT DISTRICTS PROVIDE AT LEAST 50% IN PERSON EXPERT EDUCATION. FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE ACADEMIC YEAR PROVIDED THAT APPROACH IS CONSISTENT WITH PUBLIC HELP- GUIDELINES IN PLACE AT THE TIME. AND STUDENT DEMAND ATTEND ATTEMPTED ADMISSIONS ENROLLMENT AND FINANCIAL FRAUD REPORTED ON EARLIER THIS YEAR AT THE COLLEGES THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES ONE HUNDRED MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY GENERAL FUND. TWENTY FIVE MILLION OF WHICH IS ON GOING TO SHORE UP THE PROTECTION OF SENSITIVE STUDENT AND FINANCIAL DATA AND PROVIDE NEEDED UPDATES TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE. TO SUPPORT OUR PART TIME FACULTY. ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES THE EIGHT SIGNIFICANT NEW INVESTMENT OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND IS A PART TIME FACULTY HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM. PROVIDING A STRONG FISCAL INCENTIVES FOR DISTRICTS TO OFFER HEALTH HEALTH INSURANCE TO MORE THE PART TIME FACULTY. RECOGNIZING THE CONTINUED- CONTINUING CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PANDEMIC THE INVESTMENTS AND COLLUDED IN THE BUDGET LARGELY BUILT UPON EXISTING PROGRAMS AND PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR THE SOUTH FOR THE SYSTEM TO IMPLEMENT RECENTLY CHAPTER LEGISLATION. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES ONE HUNDRED AND FIVE MILLION ONETIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. CONCOURSE NUMBERING EFFORTS RELATED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB ELEVEN ELEVEN. AND SIXTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR COLLEGES TO IMPLEMENT THE TRANSFER FORM PROVISIONS OF AB NINE TWENTY EIGHT. THAT DEMOCRATS THE DEMONSTRATION RECOGNIZES THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS NOT IMPACTED ALL GROUPS EQUALLY. THE FOURTEENTH AND- EVEN BEFORE THAT PERSISTENT LONG TERM EQUITY GAPS THAT EXISTED AT MOST IF NOT ALL OF OUR STATE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AS SUCH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES OVER FORTY MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. IN FUNDING ACROSS MULTIPLE EXISTING PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS EQUITY GAPS OF THE COLLEGES. FINALLY I WILL NOTE THAT RECENTLY RELEASED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE PROPOSED A PHASED APPROACH TO THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION IN THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA. WHICH IS SLATED TO EXPIRE AFTER THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE- IS A YEAR. THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO CREATE A FUNDING FOR USING TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE FUNDING LEVELS ALLOWING FOR A LIVING FUNDING RATES TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE BY THE STATUTORY COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. BUT REMOVING THE APPLICATION OF THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT TO BEHOLD FROM THIS PROVISION. BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. EFFECTIVELY THIS APPROACH ALLOWS DISTRICTS TO TRANSITION TO THE CORE FORMULA OVER TIME. WHILE PREVENTING PHYSICAL DECLINES BETWEEN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. WITH THAT WE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT PROPOSALS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION INCLUDED WITHIN THIS BUDGET. THANK YOU WHEN I HEAR FROM OUR L. A. L. JENNIFER CAN CHALLAN. LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO YOU SHOULD HAVE A ALEJO BUDGET THREE FOR FORTY ENTITLED OVERVIEW AND THE GOVERNOR'S HIGHER AND BUDGET PROPOSAL I'M GONNA BE REFERRING TO A FEW OF THE FIGURES IN THAT BRIEF. AFTER WALKING THROUGH A FEW OF THOSE- FIGURES ALL AND FOCUS MY COMMENTS IN THREE AREAS THE STATEMENT SPACE BUDGET ENROLLMENT AND FACILITY MAINTENANCE. SO IF YOU TURN TO FIGURE TO ON PAGE THREE YOU CAN SAY ARE GOING FUNDING FIVE STORES FOR EACH OF THE SEGMENTS ONGOING FUNDING WOULD INCREASE FOR THE COLLEGES BY FOUR POINT FOUR PERCENT. FOR CSU 6% AND FOR YEARS THE FOUR POINT 7% IF YOU'D LIKE TO START ONGOING GENERAL FUND YOU CAN SEE IT GROWING 10% AT CSU AND SEVEN POINT 7% AT UC. SO THESE ARE HIGH- INCREASES COMPARED TO MOST YEARS. IF YOU TURN YOUR FOR ON PAGE FOUR OF THE ALLEY- BRIEF YOU CAN SEE ALL THE MAJOR ON GOING A ONE TIME PROPOSALS FOR THE SEGMENTS IN THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION. REGARDING ONGOING SPENDING YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE BASING CREASES ALONG WITH THE ENROLLMENT GROWTH FUNDING FOR EACH SEGMENT. YOU CAN SEE THE LARGEST OF ALL ON GOING HIGHER AND SPENDING PROPOSALS AS A FIVE POINT. I'M SORRY A FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION AUGMENTATION AND FOR THE REVAMP MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM. SO THIS REVAMPS PROGRAM IS INTENDED PROVIDE MORE CSU AND UC. METAL AND A LOW INCOME STUDENTS WITH MORE FINANCIAL AID. AND THE REGARDING THE ONE TIME SPENDING YOU CAN SEE HAS AT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. IF YOU TURN TO FIGURE FIVE ON PAGE FIVE YOU CAN SEE ALL THE HIGHER EDUCATION SPENDING PROPOSALS THAT THE GOVERNOR EXCLUDES FROM THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS MATT. SO IF YOU WERE TO PROVIDE LAST THAN ANY OF THE AREAS SHOWN WE THINK IT LIKELY WOULD NEED TO SPEND MORE AND OTHER STYLE AREAS- ALTERNATIVELY IF YOU SPENT MORE AND ANY OF THE AREAS SHOWN YOU POTENTIALLY COULD FREE UP STYLE SPENDING ELSEWHERE. WITHIN OR BEYOND THE HIGHER EDUCATION SECTOR OF THE BUDGET. SO IT'S TURNING TO THE SEGMENTS BASED BY JETS YOU KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES A FIVE POINT APPORTIONMENT. MORE RECENT DATA SHOWING THAT COLA RATE IS LIKELY TO COMING CLOSER TO SIX POINT SEVENTEEN PERCENT. THAT WOULD RAISE COSTS ABOUT SIXTY FIVE MILLION SO INSTEAD OF A FOUR HUNDRED AND NINE MILLION DOLLAR PORTION INCREASED. COSTS WOULD BE FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION. THE COLOR RATE WILL BE LOCKED DOWN IN APRIL BUT WHETHER FIVE OR SIX OR SIX AND A HALF PERCENT THESE ARE AMONG THE HIGHEST COLDER RATES THE COLLEGES WHAT ABOUT PERCEIVED. THE COLLEGE PENSION RATES THOUGH ALSO ARE INCREASING IN THE BUDGET YEAR AT AN UNUSUAL PACE. TWO POINT 2% FOR THE STIRS DISTRICT CONTRIBUTION AND TWO AND A HALF PERCENT FOR THE PERS DISTRICT CONTRIBUTION. AND IS RELATIVELY HIGH RATES ARE LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE X. EXPIRATION OF THE PREVIOUS STATE PROVIDED PENSION RELIEF. AND THEN IN ADDITION TO PENSION PRESSURES I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT SALARY PRESSURES BOTH THE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES LIKE WE ARE- ARE LIKELY TO FACE GREATER THAN NORMAL SALARY PRESSURE GIVEN INFLATION IS AT HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVELS. THE TURN FOR A MOMENT IN THE UNIVERSITIES BASED INCREASE SAYS IF YOU LOOK AT THINGS HERE SIX ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE BUDGET BRIEF. YOU CAN SEE ABOUT CSU'S PROJECTED OPERATING COSTS SALARIES HEALTH CARE COSTS PENSION COSTS LEN IN THAT SERVICE. THOSE PROJECTED OPERATING COSTS ARE TO GROW SLIGHTLY MORE THAN THE FIVE PERCENT THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS- AT THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED. IN CONTRAST UC'S PROJECTED OPERATING COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO GROW SLIGHTLY LESS THAN ITS GENERAL FUND BASED WHEN COUPLED WITH THE TUITION REVENUE AND EXPECTS TO GAIN. AND THE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SEGMENTS IS THIS TUITION FACTOR SO WHEREAS THE ISSUES OPERATING COSTS ARE PROJECTED TO FALL SHORT. EVERY YEAR PERIOD YOU SEE IS EXPECTED TO MAKE ENDS MEET LARGELY BECAUSE OF THE GREATER TUITION REVENUE THAT'S EXPANDING ITS BUDGET CAPACITY. ATTORNEY GENERAL MATT WITH A FOCUS ON WHAT OUR MOMENT LEVELS HOW THEY'VE BEEN CHANGING WHAT'S DRIVING THOSE TRENDS ARE THEY WITHIN THE CAMPUSES CONTROL AND WHAT CAN THE LEGISLATURE DO MOVING FORWARD. SO IF YOU LOOK AT FIGURE EIGHT ON PAGE TEN IT SHOWS THOSE ENROLLMENT TRENDS. IT SHOWS THAT ENROLLMENT IS DOWN NOTABLY AT THE COLLEGES OVER THE PERIOD. IT SAYS THAT CSU ENROLLMENT WAS GROWING IN NINETEEN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT THEN FALLON TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. IT SHOWS THAT YOU SEE ENROLLMENT CLIMBED OVER MOST OF THE PERIOD BUT THEN DECLINED SLIGHTLY IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. WHEN YOU WERE STARTING YOUR ENROLLMENT TARGETS LAST YEAR YOU WERE USING THE BEST AVAILABLE DATA AT THE TIME NOT BEST DATA WITH COMING FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AT THAT THE COLLEGES WAS DOWN. BUT THE DATA WAS SHOWING THE ENROLLMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY IS WAS MORE ROBUST THAN EXPECTED. EVEN IN THE EARLY PART OF THE PANDEMIC WITH THE SHIFT TO REMOTE OPERATIONS AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE INVOLVEMENT AT THE UNIVERSITIES BROUGH. SO GIVEN THE STATE OF MOST FOLKS SIX SUSPECTED THAT UNIVERSITY ENROLLMENT WOULD CONTINUE TO GROW IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. PARTICULARLY WITH THE SHIFT BACK TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. A SENSE THAT TIME WE'VE LEARNED THAT THE UPDATED DATA IS SHOWING THE ENROLLMENT IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IS WEAKER THAN EXPECTED AT ALL OF THE SEGMENTS. WHAT'S DRIVING THE CHANGES. ONE FACTOR IS THE JOB MARKET WE KNOW THAT THE JOB MARKET IS GOOD RIGHT NOW MANY JOB OPENINGS A RECENT INCREASE IN THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE. WE JUST MORE BROADLY ARE RISING. AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE ENROLLMENT AND SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE JOB MARKET. YOU SEE ENROLLMENT AND CONTRAST IS THE LEAST THE FACTOR OF THE THREE SEGMENTS. MUNITY COLLEGES ALSO HAVE MORE STUDENTS TO HAVE CHILDREN SO THESE ADULTS MIGHT HAVE HAD TO TAKE TIME AWAY FROM SCHOOL AND WORK SO THEY COULD CARE FOR THEIR OWN CHILDREN AND OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS. AND THIS CHALLENGE AGAIN IS MOST PREVALENT AMONG COMMUNITY COLLEGES THESE PREVALENT AT UC. I'M BOTH FACTORS THE JOB MARKET AND CHILD CARE RESPONSIBILITIES ARE LARGELY BEYOND THE DIRECT CONTROL OF THE CAMPUS AS- WE ALSO KNOW THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. M. AND STARTING TO IMPACT WHAT WERE SEEN AT THE UNIVERSITIES SO TRANSFER APPLICATIONS TO CSU FOR EXAMPLE ARE DECLINING HAVE BEEN DECLINING. SO THE DECISIONS BEFORE YOU ENTERED WHICH ARMS OF WHAT TO DO ABOUT INVOLVEMENT AND YOUR CHURCH TRADITIONALLY DO SAT AND ROMAN TARGETS FOR EACH OF THE SEGMENTS. OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS YOU TYPICALLY START THEM FOR BUDGET YEAR PLUS ONE THIS GIVES THE UNIVERSITIES TIME TO PLAN AND MANAGE THEIR INVOLVEMENT WHILE STILL ALLOWING YOU DOES THAT OVERALL TAX THAT'S LEVELS. UNLESS STATE TYPICALLY PROVIDES ENROLLMENT GROWTH FUNDING NOT TO LINE TO THOSE TARGETS. THE STATE DOESN'T TYPICALLY GO BACK AND ADJUST ENROLLMENT GROWTH FUNDING RETROACTIVELY. SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THAT THE STATE PROVIDED CSU WITH GROWTH FUNDING IN NINETEEN TWENTY TO GROW BY TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS AND ENDED UP GROWING BY ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS BUT THE STATE DIDN'T GO BACK AND ADJUST CSU'S LEVEL CORD A FUNDING LEVEL ACCORDINGLY. YOU SEE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS HAS EXCEEDED ITS BUDGET TARGETS IN THE STATE HASN'T EVEN KNOWING THAT THE STATE HASN'T TO DATE GONE AND PROVIDED YOU SEE FIND MORE FUNDING. THE MAIN REASON THE STATE DOESN'T MAKE THESE RETROACTIVE ADJUSTMENTS IS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WANT THE STATEMENTS TO DISREGARD THE STATE TARGETS SO IT DOESN'T ON THE STATE THE STATE DOESN'T WANT TO ENCOURAGE THE STATEMENTS. INDEPENDENTLY MAKE THEIR OWN TARGETS THEIR OWN DECISIONS ABOUT ACCESS ABOUT ASSOCIATED STATE COSTS ABOUT ASSOCIATED PROGRAM QUALITY THE LEGISLATURE HAS WANTED TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS IN COORDINATION WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE SEGMENTS. THE LEGISLATURE DOES HOWEVER TYPICALLY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ANY UPDATED ENROLLMENT DATA WHEN IT SUCKS IT'S NEW ENROLLMENT TARGETS. SO MOVING FORWARD. FOR THE COLLEGE AS- PROVIDING A ROAMING GROWTH FUNDING EVEN IF IT'S ON USED IS VERY LOW OVER ASK IF THE COLLEGES DON'T USE THAT THAT FUNDING- REVERTS TO THE PROP NINETY EIGHT RIVERS AN ACCOUNT BECOMES AVAILABLE FOR OTHER PROP NINETY EIGHT PURPOSES. AT CSU YOU COULD CONSIDER NOT PROVIDING A MOMENT FUNDING IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. DS USER AGREEMENT IS EXPECTED TO STILL BE DOWN FROM PREVIOUSLY FUNDED LEVELS. BUT YOU COULD CONSIDER SPENDING A NEW TARGET FOR TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR THAT WOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THIS MOST RECENT WOMAN DATA. ARE YOU SEE EIGHT YOU COULD PROVIDE LESS FUNDING IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE THAN YOU EXPECTED A YEAR AGO BECAUSE I'M GONNA AS EXPECTED TO. NOT MEET THE TARGET THAT USE THAT. BUT THEN AGAIN MOVING FORWARD FOR TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR YOU COULD USE THAT MOST RECENT EMPLOYMENT DATA THAT YOU HAVE TO SET A NEW TARGET. REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU DECIDE THAT THE STATEMENTS IF YOU DECIDE ON A ROMAN TARGET WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO SET ASIDE. AFFECTIVELY RESERVE ENROLLMENT GROWTH FUNDING SO THAT YOU WOULD HAVE AND BE ABLE TO COVER IT. IN THE YEAR IN WHICH THE GROWTH MATERIALIZE THAT THIS THIS IS WHAT YOU HAD DONE THE LAST FEW YEARS. AND THAT WOULD BE IN CONTRAST TO THE GOVERNOR'S APPROACH IN THE OUT YEARS OF FINDING IT WITH IN THE BASE. FUNDING AND AS A STANDALONE ITEM IS JUST A MORE TRANSPARENT BUDGET PRACTICE. FINALLY ON FACILITY MAINTENANCE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THE STATE HAS BEEN PROVIDING THE SEGMENTS ONE TIME FUNDING FOR THEIR BACKLOGS. EVEN WITH THE STATE ALLOCATIONS. OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BACKLOG IS ABOUT THE SAME LEVEL AS IT WAS FIVE YEARS AGO. BOTH THE CSU AND UC BACKLOGS ARE NOTABLY LARGER TODAY. A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE ASK THE UNIVERSITY IS TO THE METS FACILITY MAINTENANCE REPORT BOTH OF THOSE REPORTS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED WE HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THEM. THEY SHOW THAT CSU IS FALLING ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SHORT OF SPENDING WHAT IT NEEDS TO ON AN ANNUAL BASIS TO ADDRESS THE CAPITAL RENEWAL. AND YOU SEE THE SPENDING ABOUT A BILLION LAST THAN WHAT IT NEEDS ANNUALLY TO ADDRESS ITS CAPITAL RENEWAL SO THAT'S NOT EVEN TO ADDRESS THE EXISTING BACKLOG THAT'S JUST TO KEEP THE BACKLOG FROM GROWING. ADDRESSING THESE LARGE UNDERLYING BUDGET CAPS IS LIKELY TO BE DAUNTING. BUT WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO BEGIN THINKING ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS THEM AND ULTIMATELY WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE STATEMENTS TO BUILD A LONG TERM PLAN. THAT WOULD ELIMINATE THE BACKLOG AND FULLY FUND THE ESTIMATED ANNUAL CAPITAL RENEWAL NEEDS. I KNOW I WENT OVER THAT PRETTY QUICKLY AND I'M HAPPY TO GO OVER INVOLVEMENT ISSUES OR ANY OTHER ISSUES THAT MIGHT BE OF INTEREST TO YOU MORE SLOWLY IF YOU. THANK YOU. I WANT TO START BY ASKING- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO MAKE IT A PERMANENT FINANCE BACK ON THE LINE. IF YOU CAN RESPOND TO THIS- THIS RECENT DEVELOPMENT ON THE UC ENROLLMENT. THAT LITTLE LOT LAST YEAR'S- BUDGET OUTLINE FROM THE LEGISLATURE SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR HAD YOU SEE ENROLLMENT INCREASES FOR THIS COMING FALL IT'S SIX THOUSAND PLUS THE PLUS IS. THEY'RE GONNA HAVE MORE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS BECAUSE OF THEIR NON RESIDENT ISSUE THAT MR TANG AND I'M WORKING ON FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS- THIS WAS THE AGREEMENT AND BY THE WAY THIS IS AN AMAZING STATE BUDGET I HATE I HATE TO START OUT WITH SOMETHING NEGATIVE HERE BUT IT IS AN ISSUE THAT'S OF IMPORTANCE TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WITH HER. AND THEIR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WANT TO GET TO YOU SEE NEXT FALL- AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ON JANUARY TEN MEMORIALIZED THIS UNDERSTANDING WITH- MONIES TO FIND SIX THOUSAND NEW STUDENTS TO ENROLL. THIS FALL AT THE UC SELL KIDS CAN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN LIGHTNESS ON ON YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THIS ISSUE- AND LYFT. IN LIVE AND THAT WE HAVE THE MONEY THAT WE PUT IN THE BUDGET A FEW WEEKS AGO AND THIS RECENT FORMATION I'M SURE YOU'VE GOTTEN FROM THE YOU SEE AS WELL. REBEKAH KIRK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THANK YOU FOR THE QUICK ACTION MISTER CHAIR. I GET THE GOVERNOR PERSPECTIVE THAT INCLUDES ITS FUNDING PURSUANT TO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. EVEN AT DIFFERENCE THIRTY FULL TIME EQUIVALENTS PRESIDENT STUDENTS AT THE UC IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE ACADEMIC YEAR. AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE SPECIFIES THAT THAT IS USING A BASELINE OF TWENTY IT. TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THAT SAID WE HAVE HEARD FROM UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA INTEREST IN RATES ON YOUR FOR THAT IT ENROLLMENT GROWTH AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR DISCUSSION WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE UC. AND AS YOU'RE AWARE THAT WE ADDITIONALLY HAVE FUNDING IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR THE SHIFT OF NINE HUNDRED TWO STUDENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLMENT SLOTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY. AND NON RESIDENT STUDENTS AT THREE CAMPUSES AND THAT WOULD BE SHIFTING TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENT ENROLLMENT ON TOP OF. THE SIXTY TWO THIRTY PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED. THANK YOU ARE HAVING SOME AUDIO DIFFICULTY AND SO SOME OF THE KEY NUMBERS AND DATES KIND OF CUT OUTS OUT- BUT I THINK WE GOT THE JUST TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND I THINK THE BIGGEST POINT YOU SAID AS- WE WERE ITS ONGOING WORK. LOOKING INTO AND WORKING ON IT. I GUESS THAT THE ISSUE THAT THAT WE- ARE GRAPPLING WITH IS THAT. IT WAS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT WE WOULD HAVE AT LEAST SIX THOUSAND NEW SLOTS FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS THIS FALL. AND WE PUT MONEY IN THE BUDGET AND YOU WILL YOU PUT MONEY IN THE BUDGET. ON JANUARY TENTH. THE FINALS. CELL ARE USED IT IS IT UC'S SAYING THAT THEY WANT TO. BACK OFF THAT NUMBER WHICH WE HOPE THAT THEY DON'T DO. BUT IF THEY DO IT. IS THE GOVERNOR'S. TEAM PROPOSING THAT THE YOU REDUCE. THE A PREPARATION TO UC TO BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU HAVE MONEY IN THE FOR SIX THOUSAND NOW. AND IF THEY DON'T DO SIX THOUSAND NEW DO YOU STILL THINK THEY SHOULD GET THAT ENTIRE LOT OF MONEY. WOULD YOU. ALSO IN A MONEY BACK. PROPOSED TO POSTPONE THE MONEY BACK. HOPEFULLY THERE THE AUDIO ISSUES ARE CORRECTED- OUR PROPOSAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS FOR SIXTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION THAT IS DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE ENROLLMENT GROWTH OF SIX THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FULL TIME STUDENT THE BASIS FOR THE DOLLAR AMOUNT PROPOSED IS BASED ON LOOKING AT THE MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION THAT THE UC PROVIDED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. WHEN IS THAT THE ROAMING HER THROAT WAS DISCOVERED AFTER THE PART OF PLASTIC. THIS BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS. SAID THAT THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING PRESENTLY IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS SPECIFICALLY LINKED TO THAT AMOUNT OF AN ROAMING GROWTH. BASED ON A BASS LINE HERE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THAT SAYS THE BUDGET DISCUSSION CONTINUES AND WE HAVE FURTHER CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN THE UNIVERSITY. IF THERE WERE TO BE AN ALTERNATE APPROACH THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE REPRESENTED PERHAPS AS PART OF A NEW REVISION ARE MOVING FORWARD. OKAY THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR. WITH YOU BUT BUT AGAIN IT'S OUR- HEART STRONG- NOT JUST HOPE IT'S OUR COMMITMENT THAT WE ALL CELEBRATED LAST YEAR WITH- ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM THE GOVERNOR. FROM THE SPEAKER FROM THE PRO TAN FROM THE BUDGET SURE THE ASSEMBLY FROM THE BUDGET SHARE IN THE SENATE TO ME THE BUDGETS ARE IN THE SENATE THAT THIS IS ONE OF THEIR TOP ACCOMPLISHMENTS IS YOU'RE TELLING CALIFORNIANS HEY WE HAVE AT LEAST SIX THOUSAND NEW SPOTS FOR YOU TO GO THE UC IN THE FALL. PLUS A COUPLE THOUSAND MORE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NON RESIDENT RESIDENTS WHAT SO WE INTEND TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THAT. AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAS MONEY TO PAY FOR THAT SO THIS IS A STICKING POINT THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE WEEKLY FIGURE OUT SO I WITH THAT- OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS FROM THIS PIECE FROM THE FROM THE L. A. L. OR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. MISTER MISTER MEDINA THANK YOU. YEAH I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR THE L. A. O. HAVING TO DO WITH- GOVERNOR'S A- PROPOSAL OF DOING. GOING FINALLY FOR ALL PART TIME HEALTH INSURANCE. BEFORE IT DOWN I ASK ANYBODY. I THE HELLO SO THINK THAT I WANT TO POINT OUT A RESPONSE TECHNICIAN. TO READ OF THE REVENUE BE DE AROUND SHOULD BE UP. OKAY MISCREANT WAS START OVER I WILL START OVER- I HAVE QUESTIONS OF THE L. A. O. REGARD THE GOVERNOR A PROPOSAL FOR TWO HUNDRED MILLION I'M GOING FUNDING TO THE PART TIME FACULTY HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM. BUT BEFORE ASKING THE QUESTIONS I WANT TO POINT OUT. SOMETHING THAT MY COLLEAGUE HERE FROM LONG BEACH- JUST ASK ME ABOUT AND THAT IS THE MAKE UP. OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE PART TIME FACULTY AND WHY THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE COLLEGES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA CONTINUE TO RELY. OF ON THE PART TIME FACULTY TO FUNCTION TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AND I WOULD POINT US ALL TO. I THINK A VERY. INSIGHTFUL ARTICLE THAT CAME OUT. LAST WEEK AND EDSOURCE AND IT REFERS TO THE PART TIME FACULTY AS THE GIG WORKERS OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND ASK THE QUESTION ARE CONDITION IS WORSENING IS THIS YEAR FOR CHANGES FOR ADJUNCT FACULTY. AND I WOULD JUST REMIND EVERYONE THAT YOU KNOW BEING A PART TIME FACULTY MEMBER IN- THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS A ROUGH ROAD. WITH NO OR VERY LITTLE OFFICE HOURS- NO OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH STUDENTS AND AS THE ARTICLE POINTS OUT SOMETIMES NOT EVEN HAVING THE RESPECT OF OTHER FACULTY MEMBERS AT THEIR OWN INSTITUTIONS. SO WITH THAT SAID ABOUT I'LL GO TO- MY QUESTIONS AND INDICATE THAT I VERY MUCH SUPPORT. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR PART TIME HEALTH INSURANCE- BECAUSE THEY AND ESPECIALLY THOSE PART TIME FACULTY WHO HAVE TO GO FROM ONE COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO ANOTHER HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME IN GETTING- HEALTH INSURANCE AND SO ONE QUESTION I HAVE TO- THE L. A. O. IS. AND TO THOSE FACULTY WHO HAVE TO GO FROM ONE INSTITUTION TO ANOTHER. THE EXISTING PROGRAM CURRENTLY DOESN'T ALLOW FOR ANY REIMBURSEMENTS FOR THESE SO CALLED FREQUENT FREEWAY FLYERS DESPITE WORKING OVER 40% WORKLOAD. AND I WOULD- ADVOCATE TO CHANGE THAT TO ALLOW IS FREEWAY FLYERS TO PAY OUT OF POCKET TO PURCHASE HEALTH CARE AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO. TO ADDRESS THOSE OF PART TIME FACULTY ON HEALTH INSURANCE BETTER AND THAT IS A QUESTION TO THE L. A. O. JENNIFER COULD SHOWER AGAIN FROM THE ALEJO SO THIS WAS A CONCERN THAT WE RAISED IN OUR ANALYSIS SO. IT'S NOT JUST THE YOU WERE RAISING THE ISSUE OF A PART TIME FACULTY MEMBERS WHO MIGHT BE WORKING AT MULTIPLE DISTRICTS BUT JUST WHAT THE DISTRICT IS DECIDING WHETHER TO GRANT THEM HEALTH CARE BENEFITS. AND AT THE SAME TIME THEY MIGHT BE WORKING ONE YEAR AND NOT ANOTHER YEAR DEPENDING ON THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ENROLLMENT DEMAND- SO IT'S FOR THESE REASONS THAT A FACULTY A PART TIME FACULTY MEMBERS MIGHT JUST HAVE A HARD TIME HOLDING ON TO. GOOD HEALTH CARE YEAR AFTER YEAR SO AS YOU KNOW COVER CALIFORNIA IT IS PROVIDING HEALTH CARE TO PARK CONTENT WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA IT IS SUBSIDIZED IT'S BEEN MORE GENEROUSLY SUBSIDIZED DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND SO WE WERE JUST CAUTIONING THE LEGISLATURE BEFORE CREATING A NEW PROGRAM THROUGH THE CALL URBAN AND MASSIVELY EXPANDED PROGRAM BECAUSE THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT EXISTS TODAY DATES FROM THE NINETIES BEFORE COVER CALIFORNIA- BUT FOR THE INCREASE IN SUBSIDIES THAT'S MAKING HEALTH CARE IDEALLY MORE AFFORDABLE- SO IT'S PREDATING COVERED CALIFORNIA'S THE BEFORE IT. MAKING THAT PART TIME HEALTHCARE PROGRAM MUCH BIGGER WE WERE JUST WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU WANT IN THE STATE ACTUALLY WHEN IT BE HURTING PART TIME FACULTY MEMBERS BY EIGHT MAKING THEM NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR COVER CALIFORNIA BECAUSE AS SOON AS THE DISTRICT DOES OFFER HEALTH CARE. IF IT MEETS A CERTAIN AFFORDABILITY THRESHOLD THE PART TIME FACULTY OF SORT OF OBLIGATED TO TAKE AT VAPE FORFEIT THEIR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN COVERED CALIFORNIA IT WAS ONE JUST SORT OF CAUTIONARY NOTE WHICH IS WHY WE SAID BEFORE MOVING FORWARD THE STATE COULD COLLECT MORE INFORMATION HOW MANY PART TIMERS ARE GETTING HEALTH CARE FROM WHAT SOURCE. SAYS- AND- HOW IS IT CAN TO A PARTS WORKERS IN THIS. AND WHEN WE PEOPLE OUT. AND IN GOOD HEALTH CARE THAT PART TIMERS ALREADY MIGHT BE ACCESSING SO WE DO THINK THERE ARE SOME WAYS UNDER COVER CALIFORNIA TO IMPROVE AFFORDABILITY AND I THINK OUR OFFICE IS DOING SOME WORK IN THAT AREA SO THAT WE CAN GIVE YOU SOME IDEAS ON THAT FRONT THAT SORT OF BE ON. MY HIGHER AND EXPERTISE BUT WE DO HAVE FOLKS ON OUR HEALTH UNIT THAT ARE WORKING ON THAT. RIGHT YEAH I'M NOT SURE THAT I- HAVE ANY. AT THE SAME CONCERNS YOU KNOW I MEAN IT'S CLEAR TO ME THAT THE NEED IS THERE FOR PART TIME FACULTY HI AND HELP- I'M JUST KINDA ASKING. WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO. TO HELP- IT CAN USE ANYTHING ABOUT THE 50% CAP- THAT EXIST- IN REIMBURSEMENT UNIT ENDING UP ON THAT. HELLO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS AREN'T TO REQUIRE A REQUIRED TO SPEND AT LEAST HALF OF THEIR BUDGET FOR INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSES SO FOR APPLE TV IN THE CLASSROOM THIS CAN BE PART TIME OR FULL TIME FACULTY JUST FOR INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSES- SO I IT'S A LONGSTANDING RULE IN TERMS OF IT'S AN ACCESS WITH THE HEALTH CARE- AS HEALTH CARE COSTS BECOME A LARGER PORTION OF THE BUDGET IT JUST CREATES. PRESSURE IN THIS INSTANCE- BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GOING TO BE THE MOST INSURMOUNTABLE ISSUE I THINK THE- TRICKIER ISSUE WILL JUST BE MAKING SURE THAT THE WHOLE CARE IS EITHER COMPARABLE THAN WHAT SOMEONE COULD GET IN COVERED CALIFORNIA- AND IS AS SECURE MEANING THAT THE PART TIMER REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY CLASSES ARE TEACHING REGARDLESS OF WHICH DISTRICTS REGARDLESS OF WHICH YOUR CONTROLLED ON TO. THEM AND THEN MAYBE I JUST AND BYE BYE AGAIN- SAYING WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM LONG BEACH POINTS OUT TO ME THAT WEEK WE CONTINUE TO TRY TO DO THINGS AROUND THE EDGES OF HELPING PART TIME FACULTY YOU KNOW WHETHER BE HEALTH CARE OFFICE HOURS- I KNOW THERE'S A COUPLE OF BILLS COMING UP. ONE MYSELF INCLUDED- AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ TO WORK ON- ON THE RATIOS IN THE AMOUNT OF HOURS THAT PART TIME FACULTY CAN WORK TO INCREASE THE- RIGHT TO ALLOW PART TIME FACULTY TO WORK MORE HOURS- THE FORMULAS ARE BENEFICIAL TO THEM. BUT AT THE AT THE END OF THE DAY. THE ARE NOT REALLY LONG TIMES. AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. IS THAT PART TIME FACULTY. NEED TO BECOME FULL TIME FACULTY- AND DOING ANYTHING DIFFERENT IS CONTINUING TO. EXPLOIT THE PART TIME WORKERS. AND I'LL CLOSE WITH THAT. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER O'DONNELL. THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIR AND I JUST WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE WITH REGARD TO THE PART TIME SEEMS LIKE WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN- WITH DOLLARS AND OTHER- POLICY VENTURES TO AVOID HIRING PEOPLE FULL TIME. WHEN IT MIGHT EVEN BE CHEAPER TO HIRE THEM FULL TIME AND ALL OF WITH ALL THE MONEY WE SEE BEING THROWN OF THAT EFFORT SO AGAIN I HOPE THAT SOMETHING. WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS GOING FORWARD. M. I APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS A START- THIS IS PART OF A PROCESS. BUT IF YOU JUST BACK UP A LOOK AT THIS FROM A GENERAL BUDGETING PERSPECTIVE. I QUESTION HOW RESPONSIBLE SOME OF THIS BUDGET IS BECAUSE I LOOK AT 5% INCREASE BASIC BASED INCREASE TO UC. 5% TO SEE ISSUE FIVE POINT THREE THREE. TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ABOUT SEVEN POINT FIVE PERCENT- THEY'RE ALSO GOING TO EXPERIENCE PERSON STIRS. INCREASES THIS YEAR OF AROUND TWO POINT FIVE S. IF YOU COMBINE THE TWO. SO RIGHT THERE. YOU'RE UP TO WHAT CLOSE TO TEN PERCENT. AND YET. THERE'S A 5% BASE INCREASE THE UC AND CSU. AND A FIVE POINT THREE THREE TO NINETY EIGHT ON THE ON THE COMMUNITY CALLED SIDE. IN GENERAL THERE IS ON AND I'M NOT I'M NINETY EIGHT WHICH ISN'T ENOUGH. BUT AND THEN WE'VE GOT NEW PROGRAM SO WE'RE NOT. FUNDING PLEASE COLLEGES AT A LEVEL WHERE THEY CAN STATE SUSTAIN THE PROGRAMS THEY HAVE YEAH WE'RE GOING TO GO OUT AND CREATE A BUNCH OF NEW PROGRAMS I LOOK AT. THE UC HAS WHAT ONE TWO THREE FOUR. IT'S LIKE ABOUT FOUR GIVE OR TAKE THREE OR FOUR NEW INITIATIVES NEW PROGRAMS ONGOING RIGHT DOESN'T MEAN THE NOT GOOD PROGRAMS. BUT YOU LOOK AT CSU LOOKS LIKE THERE'S ONE OR TWO THERE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE. OTHER EIGHT EIGHT NEW PROGRAMS WITH THE CPI OF ONLY FIVE POINT 33% SO THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO MORE WITH LESS NEW PROGRAMS- SO TO ME I JUST IF WE'RE NOT GOING TO FUND. THE EXISTING OPERATIONS AT A RESPONSIBLE LEVEL WHY ARE WE JUMPING INTO NEW PROGRAMS MAYBE- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND SHED SOME LIGHT ON THE. I THINK WE'VE LOST SOMEONE MISTER. YEAH DO WE HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THERE. REBEKAH CORRECT APARTMENT OF FINANCE CAN YOU HEAR ME YEAH JUST. THANK YOU ARE NOT AN AUDIT EARLIER- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I WILL FIRSTLY I WOULD NOTE SPENT BE BACK HOME BY THAT IS FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE OF THE FIVE POINT 33% THAT WAS DEVELOPED IN OF COURSE PART OF OUR GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROCESS AND WOULD BE REVISITED AS WE PREPARE FOR THE MAYOR VISION AS WELL. BASED ON ANY UPDATE THROUGH THAT PROCESS. ACTING KOLAB. GENERALLY REGARDING INVESTMENT FOR ALL THREE SEGMENTS OF COURSE FOR YOU HERE YES YOU THE PROPER FOOTBALL DIFFERENT BENEFITS FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES GIVEN THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE ARE FUNDED ACCORDING TO THE PROP NINETY EIGHT KERINCI BUT WHAT THE UC AND CSU BASE INCREASES OF 5% EACH PROPOSED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THOSE ARE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE VIEW OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF LAST YEAR'S BUDGET THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT INCLUDED 5% BASE INCREASE OF ON GOING FOR EACH SEGMENT AN ADDITIONAL IN ADDITION TO RESTORING THE CUTS THE BASED ON THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT. WE WERE JUST NOTE THAT 5% BASED BUDGET INCREASES FOR THE SEGMENT R. VERY STRONG AND HAVE BEEN VERY STRONG AND SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT IF YOU LOOK AT RECENT YEARS INVESTMENT. THANK MENSAH'S WALK. THANK YOU FOR YOU JUST ONE TO READ THAT- WE'RE GOING. TO FUND THE EXISTING PROGRAMS TO AN ADEQUATE LEVEL I DON'T KNOW THAT WE SHOULD BE STARTING A BUNCH OF NEW PROGRAMS WITH ON GOING MONEY THAT'S JUST A RESPONSIBLE BUDGET PRACTICE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS PART OF THE PROCESS. AND THEN TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OF THE RIGHT OF THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISIONS I BELIEVE IT'S TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR- THOSE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISIONS. PROVISIONS WOULD CEASE TO EXIST. IS THAT ACCURATE THAT'S A QUESTION FOR I DON'T KNOW MAYBE. SOMEONE IN FINANCE. IT DAN HAD OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO HE- THE CURRENT HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION OF THE STUDENT SENATE FUNDING FORMULA IS SET TO EXPIRE WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. SO IT'S CLEAR SAID THE LAST YEAR BE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. AND IS IT WAS A WITH THE TO ELIMINATE THAT THAT SUNSET DATE SO WHAT WE SET UP AS A CLIFF NOT NECESSARILY A SLOPE. WHAT. HOLD HARMLESS PROPOSAL SO DISTRICTS WOULD THEN BE EITHER WERE ABLE TO RECEIVE THEIR- ENTITLEMENT UNDER THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA. OR THEIR TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE- FUNDING LEVEL. AND SO THEY WOULD AT LEAST BE ABLE TO RECEIVE WHAT THEY RECEIVED IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR- IT'S JUST THAT. AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS ARE APPLIED TO THE RATES UNDER THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA- DISTRICTS WOULD STRUCTURE THIEF MORE UNDER THEIR ENTITLEMENT UNDER THE SCF THAN THEY WOULD UNDER THE FULL PROMISE ABOUT. SO IT IS MORE OF A GRADUAL SLOPE TO. ALL DISTRICTS BEING MOVED TOWARDS THE COURT- FUNDING COMPONENT OF THE FUNDING FORMULA. OKAY I LOOK AND I LOOK FORWARD TO. LEARNING MORE MORE ABOUT HOW THAT IS A SLOW. AND NOT A CLIFF FOR SOME COMMUNITY COLLEGES ACROSS THE STATE. BECAUSE AGAIN RESPONSIBLE BUDGETING WE HAVE TO LET THESE FOLKS KNOW. THAT THERE IS A CHANGE COMING AND THEY NEED TO BE PREPARED FOR AN ON THE K. TWELVE SO EITHER TO PROPOSAL. THE ROLLING THREE YEAR AVERAGE. TO CREATE A SLOPE NOT NECESSARILY A CLIFF FOR THOSE DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE THAT HAVE DECLINING ENROLLMENT. SO AGAIN I LOOK FORWARD TO LEARNING MORE ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL. SO I CAN- HAVE TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT IMPACTS. COMMUNITY. COLLEGES AND WITH THAT THANK YOU. OKAY SO MEMORY VIA DARTS. THANK YOU- SO LIKE MOSTLY THINK BUSINESSES AND FAMILIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE NATION I WOULD ANTICIPATE ANTICIPATE THE ALL THREE OF OUR SEGMENTS ARE GONNA BE FACING HIGHER OPERATIONAL COSTS- DUE TO INFLATION A THINK THE LATEST IS THAT INFLATION IS UP SEVEN PERCENT- WHICH IS THE HIGHEST THE HIGHEST IT'S BEEN SINCE I THINK I WAS TOO AND WITHOUT SHARING MY AGE IT'S BEEN MORE THAN A COUPLE OF DECADES- ONGOING COLLECTIVE BARGAINING NEGOTIATIONS- TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YOU DO YOU THINK OF THAT THE INCREASE IN BASE REFLECTED IN THE BUDGET IS SUFFICIENT TO COVER INFLATION AND OTHER OPERATIONAL COSTS FOR THIS SEGMENT I AM PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS. I ADD JENNIFER AGREE WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE 5% AT THE BASE AUGMENTATIONS FOR BOTH THE UNIVERSITY AND THE CSU SYSTEMS. ARE A PART OF THE AGREEMENT OF THE MULTI YEAR PART CONTACT AND IT IS A STARTING POINT FOR THE ADMINISTRATION- AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN WITH EACH BUDGETING CYCLE. AND TO THE L. A. L. WOULD YOU LIKE TO WEIGH IN ABOUT WHAT WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING DURING THIS TIE ESPECIALLY GIVEN INFLATION AND THE COST OF THE SEGMENTS MAY FACE THIS YEAR. YEAH YEAH IT'S AT THIRTEEN AND IN YOUR SHOES I'M IN YOUR SHOES THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS ARE FACING BECAUSE THE YOU HAVE MONEY BY INFLATION IS. SEEMING TO SUCK A LOT OF IT FROM YOUR BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS ARE FROM THE BUDGET BEFORE YOU. AND YOU DON'T HAVE THAT MANY OPTIONS. AND OTHER THAN TO BE AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL IS I THINK INDICATING EARLIER JUST TO BE CAREFUL. ABOUT THE NEW PROGRAMS THAT YOU CREATE SO THAT YOU CAN MAKE SURE YOUR EXISTING PROGRAMS ARE WELL SUPPORTED YOUR EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND FACILITIES ARE WELL SUPPORTED. BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH CREATING NEW THINGS. YOU ALSO ARE TRYING TO RESTORE TO PROTECT YOURSELF MOVING FORWARD YOU DON'T WANNA KNOW WHAT. WHETHER INFLATION IS GOING TO BE TEMPORARILY HIGH YOU DON'T KNOW THE SLOPE AT WHICH WITH IT'LL DECLINE IN SO YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR HOLD. SO ALL THE MORE REASON JUST TO BE CAUTIOUS IN YOUR EXPANSION OF ONGOING PROGRAMS AT THIS TIME IT'S SORT OF LIKE THE BEST ADVICE THAT WE CAN GO. I THOUGHT. THEY YOU'RE A AND I AGREE. YOU KNOW MY COLLEAGUE FROM BEACH- AND AS I'M LOOKING AT THE GOVERNOR'S PRIORITIES SOME OF THESE ARE REALLY GREAT PRIORITIES BUT WHETHER IT'S NEW PROGRAMS- OR SOME OF THESE GREAT PRIORITIES I REALLY WANT TO. ASK MY COLLEAGUES YOU KNOW FOR US TO FOCUS THIS YEAR. THAT IT IS OUR JOB IN THE LEGISLATURE TO ALLOCATE FUNDING ALLOCATE FUNDING- AND IF WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE TO PRIORITIZE THINGS SO. OF ALL YEARS- THAT THEIR MOST CRITICAL IN HIGHER EDUCATION LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE SETTING THE PRIORITIES HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO KNOW IF YOU CAN ALL LOOK AT THE L. A. O. PAGE EIGHT I AGREE WITH WHAT YOU'RE BOTH SAYING. AND WE'LL GET INTO IT WHEN WE GET OUR REVENUES IN THE MAY. JUST CAME OUT LAST OUR THAT LAST MONTH WE HAD SIXTEEN BILLION ABOVE. FROM WHAT'S IN THE JANUARY BUDGET SO THERE'S GOING TO BE A- SURGE. IN ONE TIME MONEY AND POTENTIALLY SOME ONGOING FOR PROP NINETY EIGHT. BUT THE MAJORITY OF THESE ONE TIME THINGS. YES I'M I'M SORRY THE MAJORITY THE SO CALLED NEW PROGRAMS. ARE ONE TIME MONEY SO WE REALLY CAN'T USE THAT ONE TIME. TO BOOST UP THE CALL ANYWAY I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE'LL HAVE AN INCREASE. PROP NINETY EIGHT NUMBER WITH THAT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE HE WILL ROUGHLY 11% SPLIT WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO DO. AN INCREASE ANYWAY. FOR THE CALYPSOSTBARTH I'M COME HOPE FOR THE BY TIME WE GET NEW REVENUE NUMBERS IN MAY. WE CANNOT DO JUST WHAT WE'RE ALL SAYING HERE RIGHT NOW. JOINT MISSOURI I JUST WANNA CLARIFY THAT THE PROGRAMS I WAS REFERENCING. OUR PROGRAM FOR THE ON GOING MONEY OKAY NOT A ONE TIME MONEY SUCH AS I UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE IN. YEAH IN IN IN AGAIN I'M GONNA MY CONCERNS. ARE ABOUT ONGOING MONEY. THAT'S IT OKAY LET'S HEAR NOW FROM OUR- FROM OUR- MISTER KING. JUST ONE QUICK QUESTION FOR DEPARTMENT FINANCE- I NOTICED YOU MENTIONED- 50% OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES WILL BE IN PERSON IS THERE A REASON. FOR THE 50% VERSUS JUST HAVING THEM GO COMPLETELY BACK IN PERSON. ON EARTH OBVIOUSLY THE UNDERSTANDING THAT PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDELINES MAY CHANGE THAT. IN ORDER PART IN A FINANCE. IMITATIONS PHOTOS REALLY DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS HAVE A VARIETY OF OPTIONS WHEN PURSUING- THEIR ENROLLMENT- WE NOTICED THE SIGNIFICANT ROLE WITH A CLIENT AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND SO D. D. CORE ASPECT OF THE- ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IS REALLY TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS HAVE AVAILABLE OPTIONS- AND I THINK. THAT'S RIGHT ABOUT 50% IS TO TRY TO MEET STUDENT DEMAND. GOT GOT IT HAVE HAVE WE HEARD FROM STUDENTS ARE DIFFERENT- COLLEGES THAT THIS IS THE WAY THEY WANNA. THEY WANT TO GO. THERE THERE HAVE BEEN SOME- ATTEMPTS TO CONDUCT SURVEYS OF STUDENTS GET UNDERTAKEN BY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE I'D I DEFER TO STAFF AND THAT THE CHANCE UP TO SPEAK MORE TO THE RESULT OF THE SERVICE BUT- I KNOW THAT HAPPENED TO. GOT IT SO THAT THE THING THAT WE COULD SAY FOR CANCER OKAY OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH I GUESS I WOULD JUST SAY I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. OF THE THREE SEGMENTS NOT THE ONE SEGMENT THAT HAS NOT. COME BACK IN PERSON EVEN THOUGH THE OTHER. INSTITUTIONS HAVE FOUND A WAY TO BE BACK IN PERSON THEY HAVE- THEY HAVE GONE BACK TO ONLINE FOR A COUPLE WEEKS BUT IN GENERAL HAVE BEEN BACK IN PERSON SO I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT THE COMMUTER CALL JUST CONTINUES TO REMAIN THIS HIGH PERCENTAGE. ON THROUGH DISTANCE LEARNING AND I DO WONDER WHETHER THAT'S THEM- KEEPING KEEPING STUDENTS LESS MOTIVATED OR KEEPING STUDENTS AWAY THANK YOU UP TO YOUR TEAM'S QUESTION IT'S CLEAR THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE ENROLLMENT HAS SUFFERED THE GREATEST LOSS AND- SO PERHAPS. THE THIS I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE VISITED- THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOW GOING TO FIFTY PERCENT- ONLINE. BUT I'M WONDERING IF THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE THAT THAT THAT BEEN IDENTIFIED- THAT ARE CAUSING THE DECREASE IN ENROLLMENT. BOTH AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND AT CSU'S AND WHAT IT IS WE CAN DO TO HELP IN THAT REGARD. MAYBE I FELT THE SPONSOR JENNIFER PAJALA AGAIN AT THE L. A. L. I'M I THINK IT'S TRICKY AGAIN BECAUSE ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS SEEMS TO BE THE JOB MARKET AND THE JOB MARKET IS REALLY COOL AND- SO THAT IS A BEEN WE DON'T KNOW AND- HOW COLLEGE IT NORMALLY WE SEE DURING ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS THAT COLLEGE ENROLLMENT DECLINES. AND COLLEGES EVEN BEFORE THAT TOWARD THE FINAL YEARS OF THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY WERE ALREADY PATCHED HOLE IN. SO IT IS THE- TO KNOW WHAT IS WITHIN THE COLLEGES CONTROL TO TRY TO INCREASE THEIR ENROLLMENT LEVELS BECAUSE IT COULD BE THAT JOBS ARE JUST VERY ATTRACTIVE FOR THE POPULATION WHO OTHERWISE. WOULD BE AND BUILDING ON THE COLLEGE'S. AND WE ARE ALSO TOLD THAT WHEN THE COLLEGES HAD BEEN OFFERING THE SAME COURSE IN PERSON ANDONLINE THEIR WAIT LIST FOR THE ONLINE ARE LONGER AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY OPENING UP MORE ONLINE. SO I THINK SOME COLLEGES ARE TRYING TO BE AS SENSITIVE TO STUDENT DEMAND AS POSSIBLE. AND BECAUSE COLLEGES GENERALLY ARE FACING SUCH ENROLLMENT DECLINES ARE STARTING TO BE MORE CREATIVE TO TRY TO ATTRACT STUDENTS SO THEY'RE STARTING TO DO SHORTER TERMS FOR CERTAIN CLASSES SO THAT MAYBE RATHER THAN A SIXTEEN WEEK SEMESTER THEY MIGHT OFFER SOMETHING FOR FOUR WEEKS. AND THEY'RE STARTING TO DO THINGS LIKE HAVE OPENED AN OPENING DATES THAT AREN'T ALWAYS JUST THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER THE BEGINNING OF JANUARY WHERE YOU COULD ENROLL A MID TERM AND STILL GET A CERTIFICATE OR COURSE CREDIT. SO THERE. ON AT LEAST SOME OF THEM ARE TRYING TO BE CREATIVE- BUT WHETHER IT'S GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO EVER GET BACK TO PRE PANDEMICS IS VERY UNCERTAIN. AND WHETHER 50% OR PROBABLY GOING TO VERY BY THE PROGRAM HOW MUCH HANDS ON WORK IS TYPICALLY REQUIRED. STUDENTS LEVEL OF INTEREST YOU CAN IMAGINE VERY DIFFERENT STRATEGIES FOR CULINARY ARTS AS AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER IN ENGLISH OR MATHEMATICS. SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT COLLEGES DO HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY TO SURVEY THEIR STUDENTS FIGURE OUT THEIR INTEREST DEVELOPED THERE- COURSE OFFERINGS ACCORDINGLY AND THAT WE CAN RECOGNIZE IT THERE ARE. THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WITHIN COLLEGES CONTROL AND THEN THINGS LIKE THAT JOB. MARKET THAT ARE OUTSIDE THEIR CONTROL. THANK YOU AND I DON'T THINK IT WAS MUCH TO PUT BLAME ON ANY JUST TO WHAT IT IS WE AS A STATE NEED TO DO. TO HELP BECAUSE IT IS A PROBLEM THIS DIDN'T DECLINE IN ENROLLMENT AND BOTH CAMPUSES AND BOTH- OKAY THE ISSUE AND THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES. SORRY FOR INTERRUPTION- OKAY NOW NOW WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM OUR THREE SEGMENTS WE'RE GONNA START WITH MICHAEL DRAKE FROM THE UC UNTIL PASTOR FROM C. U. N. N. E. LOW ORTIZ OAKLEY FROM THEIR COMMUNICATORS FROM HERE FROM ALL OF THEM AND THEN- GOING TO QUESTIONS AND- ISSUES FROM THE MEMBERS. MISTER DRAKE ARE YOU THERE. YES OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON YEP IF YOU CAN HEAR ME AM I CORRECT YES WE CAN'T THINK RIGHT BUT OKAY GOOD TO SEE ALL. TEN YEAH AGUIAR-CURRY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BUDGET. AT THREE REFLECT ON TWO YEARS OF PANDEMIC I'M REALLY PROUD OF OUR STUDENTS OUR FACULTY. AND OUR STAFF FOR THEIR STEADFAST EFFORTS TO KEEP THE UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY SAFE. AS WE CONTINUE TO OFFER THE CALIBER OF EDUCATION PATIENT CARE AND RESEARCH THAT WE ALL EXPECT. DESPITE THE CHALLENGES POSED BY COVER THE UNIVERSITY OF MAINTAINED ITS EXCELLENCE IN TEACHING. BY CONTINUING TO OFFER OPPORTUNITY AND ACCESS TO CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. FOR FALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE UNIVERSITY RECEIVED THE LARGEST NUMBER OF UNDERGRADUATE APPLICANTS ARTISTRY AND ADMIT OUR MOST DIVERSE FRESHMAN CLASS EVER. ADDITIONAL UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH SAID ARTS CENTER'S EXHIBIT EXTRAORDINARY EFFORT AND CARING FOR PATIENTS PROVIDING VACCINES AND CONDUCTING BASIC AND CLINICAL RESEARCH THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC RESEARCHERS HAVE BEEN AND ARE TODAY ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE GLOBAL CRISIS THAT WORK HAS SAVED LIVES. I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR THEIR DEDICATION AND PERSEVERANCE. WE RATE IN THIS GOOD WORK BY YOU THE LEGISLATURE AND OUR OTHER PARTNERS AND I APPRECIATE THE CRITICAL SUPPORT THAT YOU'RE PROVIDED. TURNING NOW TO THE COMING YEAR AND THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE COLLECTIVELY. WE'RE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES TO ACHIEVE A BUDGET THAT PROVIDES THE CRITICAL RESOURCES WE NEED. TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS FACULTY AND STAFF PREDICTABLY EVERY PLAN FOR THE FUTURE. WE ALSO WANT TO IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO TACKLE TOUGH ISSUES. LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE EDUCATIONAL EQUITY. AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS INCLUDING HOUSING. THE SUPPORT TO PROVIDE UNIVERSAL CALIFORNIA ENABLES US TO IN TURN TO STRENGTHEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THROUGH OUR TEACHING RESEARCH SERVICE AND PATIENT CARE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND PRODUCTION IS AN IMPORTANT AND APPRECIATED STEP IN THIS PROCESS. WE BELIEVE IT ADDRESS THIS CRITICAL RESOURCE NEEDS AND ALSO REFLECTS OUR SHARED VALUES WHEN IT COMES TO SUPPORTING CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. IMPORTANTLY THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BUDGET PRODUCTIONS WELCOME NEWS FOR ACCESS AND EQUITY. THE PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE UNIVERSAL WITH 5% INCREASES ANNUALLY FOR FIVE YEARS OFFICE BUDGET STABILITY AND RELIABLE SUPPORT THAT WILL BENEFIT OUR STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. AS WELL AS OUR FACULTY AND RESEARCHERS. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES MUCH NEEDED ONE MOMENT FUNDING FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. BY SUPPORTING THESE INVESTMENTS YOU CAN HELP US MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN ACHIEVING OUR SHARED GOALS. INCLUDING GROWING CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT EXPANDING GRADUATE EDUCATION. ELIMINATING GAPS IN GRADUATION RATES FOR STUDENTS FROM DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS. IN THE HANDS IN COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY FOR FAMILIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THIS BUDGET IS A CRITICAL BOOST NOT ONLY FOR ACCESS AND EQUITY BUT ALSO FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT. I DON'T THINK AND UNIVERSITIES UNIQUE CAPABILITIES TO MEET THE STATE'S GOALS FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCY WE CAN REALLY TAKE A BOLD STEP FORWARD AND THIS IN THIS ARENA. WE BELIEVE THESE PRIORITIES REFLECT OUR SHARED COMMITMENT TO EXPANDING THE IMPACT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ON THE LIVES OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. LET ME FIRST TURN TO ACCESS AND EQUITY. WE'RE COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT STUDENTS TO ENROLL DURING THE PANDEMIC ARE ABLE TO SUCCEED. WE WANT TO PARTNER WITH YOU TO DELIVER EXCELLENCE THAT OUR STUDENTS DESERVE. THE BUDGET MAKE MEANINGFUL PROGRESS TOWARD CLOSING GRADUATION GAPS ENSURING THAT YOU SEE STUDENTS WILL THRIVE AND CONTRIBUTE TO SOCIETY ACCESS BY INCREASING ENROLLMENT BY TWENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS BY THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY. THAT IS THE EQUIVALENT OF ADDING AN ENTIRELY NEW MIDSIZE UC CAMPUS OVER THIS DECADE. THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE BUDGET REFLECTS ALIGNMENT WITH THIS GOAL. BY SUPPORTING ECONOMIC GROWTH OF CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES AND REPLACING NONRESIDENT STUDENTS WITH RESIDENT STUDENTS AT THREE OF OUR AMPUSES WHAT THE HIGHEST NONRESIDENT ENROLLMENT. THIS MOMENT GROWTH ALONG WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO SUPPORT THE UNIVERSITY IN FUTURE YEARS WITH 1% ANNUAL ENROLLMENT GROWTH. WILL HELP THE UNIVERSITY ACHIEVE THE AMBITIOUS GOAL OF TWENTY THOUSAND ADDITIONAL STUDENTS BY TWENTY THIRTY. AND ALLOW THE UNIVERSITY TO PRODUCE A NEW DEGREE AS OUR STATE'S TWENTY FIRST CENTURY ECONOMY REQUIRES. UNIVERSITY IS COMMITTED TO ACHIEVING THE SHARED GOAL WITH THE STATE. HOWEVER IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THERE ARE SOME FACTORS THAT ARE NOT IN OUR CONTROL THAT. COULD IMPACT OUR PLANNING. FOR INSTANCE YOU MAY HAVE HEARD WE ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN LITIGATION AT THE UC BERKELEY CAMPUS THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE CAMPUS TO DECREASE ITS UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT. ABOUT FRESHMEN AND TRANSFER STUDENTS FOR FALL TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE CAMPUS'S ENROLLMENT IN COMING YEARS. EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY THIS CASE COULD IMPACT STUDENTS AND FAMILIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WOULD BE A NIGHT THE NIGHT ACCESS TO ARE YOU SEE EDUCATION. UNIVERSITY WILL CONTINUE ASSESSING THESE MATTERS EXPLORING EVERY POSSIBLE OPTION TO PROTECT STUDENT ENROLLMENTS AT UC. I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF HOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS AND EXPAND ACCESS. AT THE SAME TIME. THE BUDGET PROPOSAL INCLUDES SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES FOR FORMER FOSTER YOUTH. ARE CURRENTLY GRADUATED NOTICEABLY LOWER RATES THAN OTHER STUDENTS. SUPPORT FOR THE COUPON JUST GIVE ME SUPPORT FOR THESE FUNDS. WILL HELP IS VERY WORTHY STUDENTS SUCCEED THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. ACCESS WITHOUT AFFORDABILITY THAT'S NOT TRUE ACCESS. YOU SEE STUDENTS BENEFIT GREATLY FROM THE STATE'S TRULY EXCELLENT CAL GRANTS PROGRAM AND AS YOU KNOW THE UNIVERSITY PROVIDES AN EXCELLENT NEED BASED FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM FOR STUDENTS. THIS TOGETHER WITH PELL GRANT AND OTHER TYPES OF EIGHT. MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THE UNIVERSITY TO ENSURE THAT FULLY STUDENTS HAVE THEIR TUITION FULLY COVERED. BUT THERE'S MORE THAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE FURTHER STRIDES TOWARD A DEBT FREE EDUCATION BY THE TWENTY TWENTY TIME FRAME AVAILABLE. UNIVERSITIES BUT GOD HELPING PLANS TOWARD THIS GOAL AND IS GREATLY ASSISTED BY RECENT LEGISLATIVE CHANGES TO THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM. AND LEGISLATIVE ACTION THAT DEFINES DEBT FREE AT A LEVEL OF STUDENT CONTRIBUTION THAT COULD BE MET WITH PART TIME WORK. EARLIER I REFERENCED THE UNIVERSITY UNIQUE ABILITY TO HELP ADDRESS THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. PREVIOUS EFFORTS BY THE UNIVERSITY AVE POSITIONED US TO PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THIS FIGHT. THE TIME IS NOW TO BUILD ON THOSE PAST SUCCESSES AND SUPERCHARGE THESE EFFORTS. THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE BUDGET PROPOSAL INCLUDES A HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE UNIVERSITY TO LEVERAGE OUR INTELLECTUAL LOGISTICAL AND PHYSICAL ASSETS TO HELP THE STATE CHEAP GOALS OF CLIMATE RESILIENCY AND CLIMATE RELATED WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. UNIVERSITY IS READY TO PARTNER WITH THE STATE ON SIGNIFICANT ACTION. INCLUDING NEW INITIATIVES THAT CAN ASSIST ALL CALIFORNIANS. IN RELATED TO AND THE UNIVERSITY FUELS CHOOSE ALL OF OUR ACTIVITY. INCLUDING ADDRESSING FACILITIES NEEDS THREE CLIMATE LANCE. SO ANY ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT FOR THE UNIVERSITY'S EXTENSIVE BACKLOG OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND CRITICAL LIFE SAFETY PROJECTS. BUT NOT ONLY A NECESSITY BUT ALSO OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS AN INCREASE OUR ENERGY EFFICIENCY. AS PART OF A PATH TOWARD FULL CARBON NEUTRALITY AND ULTIMATELY DECARBONISATION. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP IN THESE EFFORTS AND FOR YOUR INTEREST IN DISCUSSING OUR PRIORITIES AND CHALLENGES LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THE COMING MONTHS DEVELOP A BUDGET THAT SUPPORT HIGHER EDUCATION. LIVES UP OUR STUDENTS AND ALLOWS THE UNIVERSITY TO CONTINUE TO SERVE CALIFORNIA. AND I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU OUR PRESIDENT DRAKE WILL COME BACK TO YOU AFTER THE OTHER TWO- MISTER CASTRO ARE YOU THERE. YES I AM CAN YOU HEAR ME YES PLEASE PROCEED. SURE MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH OU TODAY. ALONG WITH MY ESTEEMED COLLEAGUES REGARDING THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITIES FISCAL NEEDS. I WANT TO BEGIN BY EXPRESSING MY GRATITUDE FOR GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S FORWARD THINKING BUDGET PROPOSAL. WORKERS SPECIALLY APPRECIATIVE OF ITS PROPOSED MULTI YEAR CONTRACT WHICH WILL PROVIDE A RECURRING GENERAL FUND INCREASE OF AT LEAST 5% EACH YEAR THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN. IN RECOGNITION OF THE CSU'S CONTINUED COMMITMENT TOWARD ACHIEVING A NUMBER OF LONG STANDING STUDENT FOCUSED GOALS. EXPANDING ACCESS ADVANCING EDUCATIONAL EQUITY AND ENHANCING STUDENT SUCCESS. WHEN I MIGHT JUST MENTION THAT IT'S A AND- AND SO WHEN YOU INCLUDE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A TUITION AS PART OF OUR BUDGET. THAT ENDS UP BEING ABOUT A TWO POINT 85% INCREASE FOR US. WE THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR THIS PROPOSED INVESTMENT WHICH REFLECTS HIS STRONG BELIEF IN OUR MISSION AND OUR WORK. AND HIS UNDERSTANDING OF OUR NEED FOR A SUSTAINABLE PREDICTABLE FISCAL FRAMEWORK. AND I ASK FOR YOUR AND YOUR COLLEAGUES SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSED COMPACT WHICH GIVES THE CSU A MUCH NEEDED SAFETY NET TO PROTECT THE UNIVERSITY AGAINST ECONOMIC FLUCTUATION OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. A SAFETY NET THAT EXTENDS TO OUR STUDENTS. IN FACT BASED LARGELY UPON THE COMPACT I ANNOUNCED LAST MONTH THAT BARRING UNFORESEEN CHANGES TO OUR FISCAL OUTLOOK THE CSU WOULD NOT RAISE TUITION. FOR THE UPCOMING ACADEMIC YEAR. HOWEVER WELL I AM PLEASED WITH THIS PROPOSAL IT DOES LEAVE UNADDRESSED A NUMBER OF CRITICAL NEEDS AND PRIORITIES. AND I ASK THAT YOU PLEASE WORK WITH US IN TIMES SUCH AS THESE TIMES WHEN RESOURCES ARE ABUNDANT. AND NEEDS ARE GREAT TO INVEST ADDITIONAL RECURRING AND ONE TIME FUNDS SO THAT WE CAN MEET THESE KEY PRIORITIES. SPECIFICALLY WE SEEK THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO BE ADDED TO THE C. S. USE BATES BUDGET. WHILE OUR FLAGSHIP STUDENT SCCESS AFTER GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE CONTINUES TO DELIVER AN UNPARALLELED RETURN ON THE STATE'S INVESTMENT WITH GRADUATION RATES CURRENTLY AT ALL TIME HIGHS FOR STUDENTS FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS. THESE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WILL ALLOW US TO BE EVEN A TO DO EVEN MORE TO CLOSE PERSISTENT EQUITY GAPS FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR. LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS. ARE EQUITY ACTION PLAN WILL NOT ONLY ELEVATE THE LIVES OF STUDENTS OF ALL BACKGROUNDS RACES ETHNICITIES ABILITIES AND IDENTITIES IT WILL ALSO HELP US CREATE A HIGHLY SKILLED DIVERSE WORKFORCE THAT REFLECTSALL OF CALIFORNIA. AND TAKES FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE DYNAMICALLY DIVERSE TALENTS PERSPECTIVES AND SKILLS OF ALL OF OUR STATES COMMUNITIES. THESE ADDITIONAL RECURRING FUNDS WILL ALSO HELP US EARLY COMPENSATE OUR FIFTY SIX THOUSAND VALUED EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE SO ABLY CREATIVELY INSTEAD ONLY INSURED THE FORWARD PROGRESS OF OUR STUDENTS THROUGH THESE UNPRECEDENTED TIMES. THANK YOU MAY I KNOW THE UNIVERSITY FACES SIGNIFICANT COMPENSATION COSTS FOR THE SALARY INCREASES WE'VE NEGOTIATED AS PART OF THE RECENTLY APPROVED SUCCESSOR CONTRACT WITH OUR FACULTY UNION AND FOR SALARY INCREASES WE ANTICIPATE TO COME. FOR REPRESENTED AND NON REPRESENTED STAFF AND SUPERVISORS WE ARE CURRENTLY CONDUCTING A NON FACULTY STAFF SALARY STUDY THAT WILL INFORM BOTH OUR UPCOMING CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS AS WELL AS AN ADDITIONAL FUNDING REQUEST LATER THIS SPRING. BY INVESTING BOLDLY IN THE CSU YOU HELP US TO RECRUIT RETAIN AND FAIRLY COMPENSATE THE TALENTED AND MISSION DRIVEN FACULTY AND STAFF. THAT ARE SO ESSENTIAL TO OUR STUDENTS SUCCESS. WE ALSO ASKED FOR NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING TO GIVE OUR STUDENTS THE SAFE MODERN AND SUSTAINABLE FACILITIES THEY DESERVE. AND TO HELP US BEGIN TO ADDRESS THE IDENTIFIED NEED OF SIXTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FOR ACADEMIC FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND THE CSU'S CURRENT BACKLOG OF FIVE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN DEFERRED RENEWAL PROJECTS. AS FACILITY NEEDS EXIST ON EACH OF OUR TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES AND THEY RANGE FROM DECADES OLD LAB SPACES TO ANTIQUATED CLASSROOM SETTINGS THAT DETRACT FROM OUR STUDENTS LEARNING EXPERIENCE. SHARE MCCARTY AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AS WE CONTINUE TO EMERGE FROM THE EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGES OF THE PAST TWO YEARS. AND WITH OUR STATE IN A STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION. CSU STANDS READY TO DO MORE. TOGETHER I BELIEVE WE MUST DO MORE FOR OUR TALENTED AND DIVERSE STUDENTS FOR OUR REMARKABLE FACULTY AND STAFF AND FOR THE GOLDEN STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU THIS AFTERNOON. PLEASE KNOW THAT I'M ALWAYS AVAILABLE TO DISCUSS HOW THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CAN BE A RESOURCE TO YOU AS YOU CONTINUE TO EXPLORE WAYS TO DEVELOP CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE SUPPORT PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION AND TACKLE THE CRITICAL ISSUES. CURRENTLY FACING OUR GREAT STATE. THANK YOU THANK YOU CHANCELLOR CASTRO AT NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM CHANCELLOR ORTIZ OAKLEY. ARE YOU THERE. I AM HERE YES PLEASE PRESS THAT AFTERNOON AND THAT. YES GOOD AFTERNOON AND HAPPY NEW YEAR CHORE MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON EDUCATION FINANCED TO PLEASURE TO BE HERE THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION AND FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE WORK AT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE MY COLLEAGUES IN PARK RIDGE BUT YES YOU'RE THE SEE. HERE TODAY. FOR I CAN INTO A DISCUSSION OF THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BUDGET PROPOSAL I WANT TO SHARE. SOME EXCITING FINDINGS ABOUT THE IMPACT OF OUR SYTEM RECENTLY. WE RELEASED A TIMELY REPORT WITH DATA. THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME ILLUMINATES ENORMOUS VALUE OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AT THAT THE VALUE THAT IT BRINGS TO OUR STATE'S ECONOMY. OR QUANTIFIED CIRCLE IMPACT OF OUR COLLEGES AND REINFORCES THE HARD WORK OF OUR FACULTY OF OUR STAFF AND OF COURSE OF COURSE STUDENTS. AS THEY ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY. CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE HAD AN ANNUAL ECONOMIC IMPACT OF MORE THAN A HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. WHICH IS EQUAL TO APPROXIMATELY FOUR POINT 2% OF THE CALIFORNIA'S TOTAL GROSS STATE PRODUCT. FOUR HUNDRED SIXTEEN COLLEGES ARE AMONG THE STATE'S LARGEST EMPLOYERS. WITH MORE THAN NINETY ONE THOUSAND FULL TIME AND PART TIME FACULTY AND STAFF- BUT THE ECONOMIC AND- IMPACT IN THE BENEFITS OF OUR SYSTEM EXTENDS MUCH FURTHER. CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY COLLEGES PROVIDES ABOUT TO FULL RETURN ON INVESTMENT FOR OUR TAXPAYERS. FOR EVERY DOLLAR SPENT ON EDUCATING STUDENTS ATTENDING OUR COLLEGES THE PUBLIC WILL RECEIVE AN AVERAGE OF TWO DOLLARS AND TEN CENTS IN RETURN OVER THE COURSE OF STUDENTS WORKING LIFE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY FOR EVERY DOLLAR INVESTED. STUDENTS WILL GAIN FIVE DOLLARS AND FUTURE EARNINGS. THAT SUM TOTAL OF SOCIAL SAVINGS COMBINED WITH STUDENTS INCREASE FUTURE INCOME COMES TO AN ESTIMATE ESTIMATED. TWO POINT SIX TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. SO THE PRIMARY TAKEAWAYS ITS CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN OUR COLLEGES MEANS INCREASED SUCCESS FOR MILLIONS OF STUDENTS. WHO WILL IN TURN BE HIGHLY VALUED AND ESSENTIAL PART OF CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE. WE PROVIDE YOU A COPY OF THE REPORT AND I HOPE YOU GET A CHANCE TO REVIEW IT WHEN YOU GET AN OPPORTUNITY. I'LL NOW TURN MY FOCUS- TO THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES BUDGET PRIORITIES I WANT TO BEGIN. BY THANKING ALL OF YOU- THANKING EVERYONE IN THE LEGISLATURE FOR HELPING LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY JUST A YEAR AGO OUR COLLEGES WERE SHELTERING ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN DEFERRALS. AND NOW WE ARE PRESENTED WITH THE OPPORTUNITY. TO ADVANCE AN EQUITABLE RECOVERY FOR CALIFORNIA. WE'RE PROUD TO TODAY'S COLLEGE POPULATION LOOKS LIKE AND REPRESENTS CALIFORNIA IN FACT. 64% OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE. COMMUNITY COLLEGE ENROLLEES OUR STUDENTS OF COLOR STUDENTS ARE TWENTY FIVE YEARS OR OLDER. IN THE LAST FEW YEARS CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE PLACED A GREATER FOCUS ON HOW TO REACH THE POSTER ADDITIONAL STUDENTS THIS FALL. THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE VISITED EIGHT OF OUR COLLEGES TO LISTEN TO AND HEAR DIRECTLY FROM OUR STUDENTS ABOUT THEIR NEEDS. WHAT ONE STUDENT IN PARTICULAR ARE FROM SAN DIEGO COLLEGE MONIQUE SHARE THE FOLLOWING WITH US. COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE THE ONLY SAFETY NET AVAILABLE FOR INDIVIDUALS LIKE ME WHO HAVE BEEN FAILED BY OUR SYSTEM. OUR WORK IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS CHALLENGING BUT IT'S CRITICAL. AND WE ASK OUR STATE LEADERS TO REMAIN OUR STEADFAST PARTNERS SO THAT WE DON'T LOSE ANY MOMENTUM. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED ROAD MAP FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES SETS FORTH A BOLD NEW VISION FOR HIGHER EDUCATION AS A LEVER FOR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND AS A MEANS TO CLOSE STUBBORN EQUITY GAPS IN CALIFORNIA. THIS FRAMEWORK BUILDS UPON THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS VISION FOR SUCCESS GOALS IT CREATES NEW AVENUES FOR DATA SHARING ACROSS WITH THE COLLABORATION AND FUNDS ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR BOTH COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND OUR SYSTEM. WITH A CLEAR EMPHASIS ON CLOSING RACIAL EQUITY GAPS AND ADVANCING STUDENT SUCCESS THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR GOALS IN THE VISION FOR SUCCESS AND IT'S A VALIDATION OF THE WORK WE HAVE BEEN PRIORITIZING FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS. THE GOVERNOR AGAIN HIGHLIGHTS ITS COMMITMENT TO THE STUDENT CENTER FUNDING FORMULA. OATES'S MINIMUM FUNDING LEVELS FOR A DISTRICTS SOMETHING THAT MANY OF OUR DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR. THE STUDENT CENTER FROM FUNDING FORMULA IS A KEY PART OF THE SOLUTION TO AN EQUITABLE RECOVERY AND ESPECIALLY IN THIS TIME OF DECLINING ENROLLMENT. IT'S CREATED A FORM OF STABILITY FOR COLLEGE. FURTHER THE DRIVING TENANTS OF THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA ACCESS EQUITY AND SUCCESS ARE MORE RELEVANT THAN EVER. IN OUR REMINDER THAT OUR STUDENTS NEEDS AND SUCCESS MUST COME FIRST. DURING THE PANDEMIC. NATIONAL DECLINES IN ENROLLMENT HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCED. BY COLLEGES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AS WELL HERE'S CALIFORNIA. ONLY DURING MY TIME- SUPPORTING- ARE- SECRETARY OF EDUCATION MAKO CARDONA. I GOT TO SEE FIRSTHAND THE DECLINES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND THEY ARE TROUBLING IT'S BEEN POINTED OUT BY MEMBERS. OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE. UP THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES SERVE THE LARGEST PERCENTAGE OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS AND ADULT LEARNERS. SO THE PROPOSED A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME PER STUDENT RETENTION ENROLLMENT EFFORTS ARE TIMELY AND NECESSARY AND THEY WILL. ENABLE OUR COLLEGES TO DO. MARKET STRATEGIES TO ENGAGE OUR STUDENTS WHO MAY HAVE WITHDRAWN DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC AND TO CONNECT WITH CALIFORNIANS WHO MAY BE HESITATING TO ENROLL IN A COLLEGE. THIS PROPOSAL RECOGNIZES THAT OUR ENROLLMENT EFFORTS MUST ALSO INCLUDE A DEEP LOOK AT OUR ACADEMIC PATHWAYS. WE SUPPORT INVESTMENTS IN STREAMLINED ACADEMIC PATHWAYS SUCH AS COMMON COURSE NUMBER RAIN TRANSFER. AND THE ADDED MOMENTUM TO THE EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN RETENTION AND TO SUPPORT TEACHER TRAINING. WE'RE ALSO PLEASED TO SEE A ROBUST INVESTMENT IN PART TIME FACULTY HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND WE HAVE BEEN UNDER INVESTING IN THE HEALTH OF OUR PART TIME FACTOR. WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WILL INCREASE ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTHCARE FOR OUR FACULTY THIS INVESTMENT IS LONG OVERDUE. AND WE BELIEVE IT IS ESSENTIAL. AS WE ENTER THE SECOND YEAR THE PANDEMIC. WE NEED TO EMBRACE THE LESSONS AND THE OPPORTUNITIES OF THIS PANDEMIC AND RECOGNIZE THE COLLEGE'S FACULTY AND STUDENTS WILL NEED TO LEVERAGE TECHNOLOGY TO INCREASE ACCESS. AND TO CONTINUE TO INNOVATE IN AND OUT OF THE CLASSROOM. NOW I KNOW THAT THERE WILL LIKELY BE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE WE'RE AT IN TERMS OF ONLINE INSTRUCTION. THE ONE THING THAT WE HAVE LEARNED ABOUT THIS PANDEMIC IS BY IMPLEMENTING QUALITY TECHNOLOGIES AND SUPPORTING OUR FACULTY WE CAN CONTINUE TO ENGAGE OUR STUDENTS. EVEN THROUGHOUT THIS CRISIS. THE SEVERITY OF OUR NEEDS CONTINUES TO INCREASE IN THE AREA OF TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT JUST IN THIS LAST FEW DAYS WE'VE HAD ANOTHER CYBER SECURITY ATTACK ON ONE OF OUR COLLEGES SO FUNDING THIS AREA THIS AREA OF TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW TO OUR COLLEGE AND MODERNIZING OUR TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURES SUCH AS SIXTY THREE APPLYING IT'S CRITICAL TO ENSURE FACULTY AND STUDENTS SENSITIVE DATA ARE PROTECTED FROM THESE ATTACKS. A SPECIFIC IMPORTANCE TO THEIR CALIFORNIA'S A RECOVERY IS THE ABILITY OF THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO ADVANCE EQUITABLE EDUCATIONAL REFORMS AND WORKFORCE PATHWAYS TO HELP CALIFORNIANS RECOVER DR. BUT I BECAME CHANCELLOR IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. BOB MY OFFICE HAD A HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO AUTHORIZED POSITIONS ADDED MINISTER SEVENTY ONE PROGRAMS I REALLY APPRECIATE MY FAVORITE SIMPLY MEMBER FROM LONG BEACH BRINGING UP THIS ISSUE. BUT WHEN I BECAME CHANCELLOR WE HAD SEVENTY ONE PROGRAMS TODAY OUR OFFICE ADMINISTERS A HUNDRED FIVE PROGRAMS WITH ONLY FIVE ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL IN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND WHEN THE PANDEMIC STARTED 10% OF OUR STAFF WERE REDIRECTED TO STATE EMERGENCY SUPPORT AND OUR AGENCY LIKE ALL OF THE OTHER AGENCIES ALSO HAD TO ACHIEVE FIVE PERCENT. SAVINGS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO THE PROPOSED POSITIONS FOR THIS OFFICE ARE MUCH APPRECIATED AND ARE NEEDED TO CONTINUE TO BETTER SERVE OUR COLLEGES AND OUR STUDENTS LASTLY WE CONSIDER THE FINAL TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE SPENDING PLAN I URGE YOU TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE SOLUTIONS THAT REPRESENT THE TRUE TRUE COST OR THE TOTAL COST OF SUCCESS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS I THINK- MEMBER MCCARTY AND ALL OF YOU FOR THE EFFORTS THAT YOU HAVE MADE TO HELP. FUND THE TOTAL COST OF EDUCATION FOR OUR STUDENTS WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO PUSH FORWARD- AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO MAKE GREATER INVESTMENTS IN OUR STUDENTS. WHO NEED IT RIGHT NOW THE MOST PARTICULARLY IN THE AREAS OF HOUSING INSECURITY MENTAL HEALTH AND FOOD AND SECURITY ADDRESSING THE TRIP COST OF COLLEGE WILL HELP OUR STUDENTS THRIVE. AND IN TURN HELP OUR STATE. SIXTY EIGHT. I'LL CLOSE BY EMPHASIZING THAT THIS MOMENT CALLS. FOR US TO LEVERAGE TE RESOURCES PRESENTED IN THIS BUDGET TO SUPPORT STUDENTS AND WITH URGENCY THAT THEY EXPECT FROM US. WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON KEEPING STUDENTS ON THEIR SUCCESSFUL JOURNEYS AND MAKING SURE THAT IT CONTINUES TO BE THE NORTH STAR OF OUR WORK. THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR ONGOING PARTNERSHIP AND SUPPORT AND I LOOK FORWARD. TO WORKING WITH YOU THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THIS BUDGET YEAR. OKAY THANK YOU- LET ME ASK THE FIRST QUESTION TO MR MR TEAM ONE AND HE HAD THE HE HAD TO LEAVE THE HEARING BUT WHEN WE ASK ALL THREE OF YOU. TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF- GETTING BACK TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AND I KNOW ITS- FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES MORE SEVEN ISSUE THE UC AND CSU BUT- PERSONALLY YES THINGS ARE CHANGING WE'RE SEEING THE NATIONAL DEBATE RIGHT NOW WITH OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. SO WHERE ARE YOU IN OUR PLANS TO GET TWO MORE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. SURE I'D BE HAPPY TO BEGIN- A CHARMER CARTY THIS IS- I KNOW I'M GOING ISSUE THAT ALL OF OUR HUNDRED SIXTEEN COLLEGES ARE DEALING WITH AT THIS BEEN REPRESENTED. ALREADY OUR STUDENTS IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. HAVE BEEN HIT HARD BY THIS PANDEMIC- THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET- THERE- LOOKING FOR EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO BE AS FLEXIBLE AS WE POSSIBLY CAN IN ORDER TO MEET THEIR NEEDS. WE FULLY WANT TO ENGAGE OUR STUDENTS. IN PERSON IN OUR COLLEGES ARE WORKING HARD WITH OUR LOCAL HEALTH OFFICIALS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN OPEN UP MARKETS OUR CAMPUSES. IN THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF STATE MANNER AND ALSO WORKING WITH OUR FACULTY AND STAFF- RIGHT NOW WE ARE- APPROXIMATELY 60% IN PERSON GREATER THAN THAT- BEFORE THE- MAKRAN VIRUS YET. BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT HAD AN IMPACT ON OUR- SPRING SEMESTER. BUT LET ME ALSO SAY THIS WE ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO STUDENT DEMANDS- WE HAVE CONDUCTED A SURVEY OF STUDENTS. ABOUT A 60% OF OUR STUDENTS- BURKE SHOULD BE ABOUT HALF OF OUR STUDENTS 50% OUR ASKING FOR A HYBRID SOLUTIONS THAT MEANS- IT PERSON AND ONLINE I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE DEMANDING US PRESS TO PROVIDE THAT KIND OF FLEXIBILITY AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK TO PROVIDE THAT FLEXIBILITY- AND- THIS IS EVEN HIGHER FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO STUDENTS- SO WE'RE PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO. OUR STUDENTS OF COLOR AND OUR LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS- AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE- MANY OF OUR PARENTS- SO THEY'RE WAITING FOR THEIR SCHOOLS. TO BE COMPLETELY IN PERSON AS WELL CHILD CARE IS A BIG ISSUE FOR OUR STUDENTS. SO I DO FEEL THAT WE ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THAT MRE MORE STUDENTS ARE CHOOSING- IN PERSON OPTION IN OUR COLLEGES ARE ANXIOUS. TO ENGAGE THEM IN PERSON HOWEVER THERE WILL BE CONTINUED DEMAND. FOR AS MUCH AS MUCH FLEXIBILITY AS POSSIBLE AS LONG AS WE CONTINUE TO FEEL THE EFFECTS OF THIS PANDEMIC. OKAY THE UC AND CSU. DOT ORG I CAN GAGO NEXT THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN AND SAY THAT- OUR SCHOOLS ARE THAT. IF THE TWO THINGS FAR ARE HOSPITAL'S ART AND ART GRADUATE FROM- THAT PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS RELATED HEALTH SCIENCES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN PERSON OUT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE- PANDEMICS ARE PART OF OUR ENTERPRISES BEEN OPEN IN FACT WORKING THAT OUT EVEN THOUGH A BURNING THE MIDNIGHT OIL REALLY SENT- ABOUT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PANDEMIC OUR UNDERGRADUATE CAMPUSES ARE- THEY CHANGE THEY VERY A BIT BUT THEY RANGE BETWEEN ABOUT 858285% NINETY SEVEN PERCENT. IN PERSON AS WE SPEAK- AND THAT'S- THAT DEPENDING ON VARIOUS LOCAL FACTORS SO OVERWHELMINGLY THEY HAVE RETURNED DO IN PERSON- IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LARGE RESIDENTIAL MANY OF OUR STUDENTS LIVE ON CAMPUS AND SO. IT THAT THEY'RE THERE AT THE CAMPUS ALREADY IN BEING IN PERSON DOESN'T REQUIRE TRAVELING AND THAT THEY HAVE RETURNED LARGELY TO IT IN PERSON CLASS WE DO HAVE. ON ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES OF MUCH GREATER FRACTION OF INSTRUCTION AVAILABLE. AS VIRTUAL INSTRUCTION EVEN THOUGH STUDENTS ARE LIVING ON CAMPUS THEY MAY BE IN THE DORM BUT A WHOLE SERIES OF CLASSES ARE PROVIDED ARE BEING PRESENTED IN AN ONLINE FASHION AND MANY MORE THAN WITH THE THAT WERE THE CASE TWO YEARS AGO AND AS WE LOOK TOWARD THE FUTURE THAT SET AN ACTIVE AREA OF EVOLUTION. FOR OUR FACULTY WE ARE SURE THAT THE NUMBER OF ONLINE COURSES AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS. AS IS THE CASE TODAY TE ONLINE THE- NUMBER OF COURSES NUMBER OF ONLINECOURSES AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS AT THAT THAT THIS YEAR NEXT YEAR THE YEAR THEREAFTER WILL INCREASE UNTIL WE'RE AT A PLACE WHERE THERE'S A GOOD BALANCE BETWEEN. THE ONLINE AND IN PERSON. BUT BUT AS WE NOW TO BUY EIGHTY FIVE. EIGHTY FIVE TO NINETY SEVEN PER ARE A PERSON WE SPEAK. OKAY THANK YOU NEXT. YES THANK YOU CHAIR MCCARTY- FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY- THERE THERE IS A SOME DIFFERENCES BY CAMPUS BUT ON THE HIGH SIDE IT'S ABOUT 85% AND ON THE LOWER SIDE ABOUT 70% IN PERSON- WE ARE VERY MUCH STUDENT FOCUSED AND- AT EACH CAMPUS THEY'VE WORKED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING WHAT WE CAN TO SUPPORT THERE'S SUCCESS. AND AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE MENTIONED- SOME STUDENTS ACTUALLY PREFER ONLINE EDUCATION OR PREFER A HYBRID OPPORTUNITIES SO WE'RE TRYING TO BE AS THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THIS IS WE CAN GOING FORWARD AND AT THE SAME TIME WE KNOW THAT- MOST STUDENTS REALLY WANT TO BE ON THE CAMPUSES AND- WE'VE BEEN AS- SUPPORTIVE OF THAT AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. OKAY THANK YOU WELL IT CERTAINLY ARE- OUR DESIRE THAT WE GET BACK TO NORMAL AS MUCH ASWE CAN WITH FIRST AND FOREMOST IT'S ENROLLING IN HIGHER EDUCATION. EMAIL THE BURKINI COLLEGES TOOK THE BIGGEST HIT- AND ALSO COMMUNITY COLLEGES FACED THE THAN THE LARGEST NUMBER. OF OF FULLY ONLINE COURSES SO YOU KNOW IS THERE A CORRELATION THERE I DON'T KNOW BUT IT IT IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS A CONCERN- I NEXT WENT TO- MOVED TO- QUESTIONS FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA- MISTER DRAKE IF YOU CAN COME BACK. I WONDER IF YOU CAN- TALK TO THE COMMITTEE ABOUT THIS COURT DECISION THAT CAME OUT LAST WEEK I KNOW MR MEDINA IS AWARE OF IT I'M NOT SURE IF THE OTHERS BUT- HE SENSUALLY A- ALAMEDA SUPERIOR COURT- BASICALLY- PUT IN MOTION- AT A RULING WHICH WOULD ESSENTIALLY- FREEZE ENROLLMENT. AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA BERKELEY AND NOT ONLY FREEZE ENROLLMENT BUT HAVE THEM HAVE TO SLASH. THEIR FRESHMAN FRESHMAN CLASS BY ABOUT 30% OR ABOUT THREE THOUSAND STUDENTS. AND YOU KNOW THIS COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE AN IMPACT ON OTHER- COLLEGES AS WELL THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA SO- MISTER DRAKE CAN YOU GIVE US AN UPDATE ON ON AND- THAT. THAT RULING JUST A FEW DAYS AGO- WHAT'S NEXT I KNOW IT'S BEING APPEALED TO THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT. AND THEN- YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY ARE THERE ANY LEGISLATIVE- REMEDIES THAT THAT COULD BE DONE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. MR JEFF THANK YOU YES THANK YOU DOCTOR MCCARTY AND WE WERE OF COURSE VERY DISTRESSED BY THE UNFORTUNATE THAT THAT DECISION BY THE COURT AND THEN ARE WE FILED THE STAY AND- THE LAST WEEK WE HEARD THAT THE STATE WAS DENIED ALLOWING THE APPEAL TO GO FORWARD BUT DID NOT AND LET'S. WON'T BE DECIDED UNTIL THE SUMMER SOMETIME SORT REALLY A COMPLETELY THAT'S THAT FREEZING OR CAPPING OF THE STUDENTS AT THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE DOT LEVEL THAT IMPACTS BOB THAT IN A DEVASTATING FASHION THE ACCEPTANCE AS WE WOULD BE SENDING OUT OR IN THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS SO WE- HAVE FILED IT- I MOTION FOR THAT TO GRANT THE STATE TO THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT UNDERSTAND THAT WAS. FILED EARLIER TODAY THIS REALLY CAME OUT LAST THURSDAY AFTERNOON SO FILE THAT APPEAL- THE BILL TODAY SO WE WILL WORK THROUGH THE LEGAL PROCESS TO SEE IF WE CAN GET A STATE WELL THE ISSUES THAT ARE BEFORE THE COURTS ARE BEING ADDRESSED THEM. OUT SO WE'RE NOT PUTTING ALL OF OUR RESOURCES. INTO TRYING TO UP IS TRUE THAT IS THAT THE LOWER COURT ACTION HAD A- PUT ON. THE ENROLLMENT PLANNING FOR THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHICH TENDED TO BE A TIME WHICH WAS COMPLETELY A TYPICAL FOR OUR INVOLVEMENT OBVIOUSLY WE HAD. HIGHER ENROLLMENT AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE YEAR BUT THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WAS A TIME WHEN WE WORK OUT JUST- YOU'RE STILL RETURNING BACK. UNDER THE PANDEMIC AND SO IT PUTS AN ARTIFICIALLY LOW CAP ON OUR- ON OUR INVOLVEMENT AT UC BERKELEY AND- REDUCING THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN THE FRESHMAN CLASS BY THREE THOUSAND. WOULD HAVE A DEVASTATING IMPACT OBVIOUSLY ON THOSE THREE THOUSAND STUDENTS BUT THEN THAT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THAT FACT OF HAVING SO MANY OF YOUR CLASSES FOR FIRST YEAR STUDENTS WHAT IMPACT INSTRUCTION AS THEY BECAME SECOND YEAR STUDENTS AND THIRD YEAR STUDENTS. IT WOULD IN FACT UNIVERSALLY UNDERSTOOD FOR YEARS AND WE COULDN'T REMEDY THIS BY SAYING WELL THAT'S FINE THIS IS A- THAT HIP FOR THIS ONE YEAR- BIG HIT AS IT MAY BE A HIT THIS ONE YEAR NEXT YEAR WILL TAKE IN A NORMAL FIRST YEAR CLASS AND WE'RE LOOKING AT NEXT ADDITIONAL THREE THOUSAND STUDENTS. AS SOPHOMORES THERE'S NO THERE'S NO SUCH THING SO THAT WE ARE VERY- FOCUS VERY MUCH ON THIS AND- WITH THE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE LEGISLATIVE LEAD OTHERWISE THE THINGS WE WILL OF COURSE BE EXPLORING ACTIVELY AS THE WEEKS. ALONG WITH THE IN THE LEGAL ARENA TODAY WHAT WE'VE DONE IS FILED AN. APPEAL BUT TO THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT. YES CERTAINLY IT IS. AND I KNOW- YOUR REPRESENTATIVE THERE- IN BERKELEY IN THE ASSEMBLY MISS WICKS HAD BEEN COMMUNICATING WITH SOMEONE DIRECTING AND I END UP BUT IT'S NOT JUST- BERKELEY YOU KNOW FRANKLY UC BERKELEY BELONGS TO CALIFORNIA NOT JUST BERKELEY OF COURSE BUT THIS HAS AN IMPACT. ON ALL OF HIGHER EDUCATION SO- WE'RE EXTREMELY CONCERNED WE DON'T WANT TO LIMIT ACCESS AND I THINK YOU KNOW. THE FRESHENING PIECES WERE LISTENING TO THE CONCERNS OF THESE COLLEGE TOWNS LIKE BERKELEY AND SAYING OKAY WE'RE GOING TO BUILD MORE STUDENT HOUSING AND SELF I KNOW THIS CAMPUS AMONG OTHERS HAS A PLAN FOR EVERY TIME YOU ENROLL. MANY STUDENTS WE ADDRESS A HOUSING ACCORDINGLY SO- I THANK YOU THAT INSTEAD I GUESS THE QUESTION THAT I ASKED THAT IT I DIDN'T HEAR. IS YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW MILLER TRYING TO FIGHT THIS ISSUE WITH THE COURT SYSTEM BUT IS THERE ANY. FAINT POTENTIALLY THE LEGISLATURE. COULD DO. TO TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE CAN CONTINUE HIGHER EDUCATION ENROLLMENT ACCESS. YES I THINK OVER- OVER THE- IF THE MEDIUM TERM SOLUTION THAT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS CAME FROM A SEQUEL- REVIEW AND GOOD REALLY WITH EXPANDED OR IN LARGE VIEW OF WHAT IT SEEK ROUTE REVIEW SHOULD INCLUDE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT BACK TO PLAY WITH- THE OF THE LEGISLATURE AND OUT THEN AND MORE BROADLY WORK ISSUE WERE ENTIRELY. INTERESTED IN HAVING APPROPRIATE THAT STRUCK OUT AT CLASSROOMS AND LABORATORIES IN HOUSING FOR STUDENTS THAT'S WORTH ENTIRELY INTEREST IN THAT AND WE'RE ENTIRELY INTERESTED IN THAT PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE LIVE AND THOSE THINGS NEED TO BE BALANCED BOB THIS DUCK GOES ENTIRELY IN ONE DIRECTION AND ENTIRELY AGAINST THE OTHER AND- ALSO WE WILL NEED TO HAVE A LONGER TERM SOLUTION AND WE'LL BE HAPPY TO DISCUSS THIS WITH YOU AND- AND YOUR COLLEAGUES. THAT THESE DAYS AND WEEKS ROLE FOR. YEAH I KNOW THAT WAS A- HOT POTATO POLITICALLY SO TO SPEAK- YEARS AGO GOVERNOR BROWN SAID REFORMING. C. BECAUSE GOD'S WORK SOMETHING LIKE THAT. BUT- YOU KNOW I KNOW THE- FORMER CITY COUNCIL MEMBER AS WAS MY COLLEAGUE HERE MR DONNELL AND EVERY TIME WE APPROVE A NEW TARGET OR WALMART OR HOTEL. THAT'S WE HAVE A SECRET. ANALYSIS I DIDN'T NECESSARILY THINK IN ROLLING- MORE STUDENTS IN EXISTING CAMPUS- HAS THAT THRESHOLD SO I THINK THAT'S A UNIQUE UNIQUE- BASICALLY TOOL THAT SOME NIMBYS. IN A PART OF CALIFORNIA WHO WON THE FIGHT KAJOL CARE DUCATION ESSENTIALLY SO I THINK THAT RAISES SOME GOOD QUESTIONS- MISTER O'DONNELL I THANK YOU MR MCCARTY AND I FIND IT INTERESTING NOW THAT YOU CAN'T GO TO COLLEGE BECAUSE A SEQUEL. RIGHT WHAT AN INTERESTING DYNAMIC WE FIND OURSELVES IN- BUT ON TO OTHER THINGS- I THINK I APPRECIATE- ALL THE PRESENTATIONS TODAY- MIKE AND I AND AGAIN I AGREE WITH MR CARTY MISTER KING THAT COLLEGES NEED TO BE OPEN. I LIVE ACROSS THE STREET FROM LONG BEACH STATE AND I CAN TELL YOU TRAFFIC THERE IS MUCH LATER- THEN IT WOULD BE IF THE SCHOOL WERE OPEN. SO THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE. YOU KNOW FROM FROM FROM MY PERSPECTIVE- GOING ON CAMPUS SO. AGAIN I. PEOPLE LEARN BEST IN PERSON THAT'S THE TEACHER IN ME AS THE PARENT OF THE ENEMY I HAVE A DAUGHTER THAT IT COMMUNITY COLLEGE AT MR OAKLEY'S FORMER COLLEGE- ENJOYING THE COLLEGE PROMISE THAT HE HELPED CREATE. AND I CAN TELL YOU I KNOW THAT SHE'S GOING TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL SHE'S IN THAT CLASSROOM AND I UNDERSTAND. THAT SOME PEOPLE OF CHILD CARE HEALTH ISSUES THAT WE SHOULD ACCOMMODATE AS WELL BUT AGAIN- WE NEED TO GET OUR COLLEGES OPEN SCHOOLS ARE OPEN K. TWELVE ZERO COMMENT IS- FOR QUESTION REALLY IS FOR. MR OAKLEY- I ASSUME YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE RECENT K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE AUDIT- WHEREIN THAT PROGRAM WAS AUDITED THAT IS- MONEY THAT IS GIVEN TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO ADMINISTER FOR THE K. TWELVE SIDE. M. DID YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT ON THE FINDINGS OF AN HONOR ROLL MISTER PUBLIC JOE CIRCLING. WHAT THANK THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION A MEMBER O'DONNELL- IT'S IT YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE TALKED ABOUT THE K. TWELVE STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM FOR A LONG TIME- THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES STAND READY TO SUPPORT. A STRONG WORK FORCE IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM THAT WE CAN- IT WAS THIS IS NOT OUR CHOICE- THIS WAS APPROPRIATED TO US BY THE LEGISLATURE AND FORMER GOVERNOR. AND WE WILL WE WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN WITHIN THE CAPACITY THAT WE HAVE IN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. TO TO ADMINISTER THIS PROGRAM IS YOU'RE AWARE. WHEN THAT PROGRAM WAS APPROPRIATED TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANGES OFFICE IT WAS DONE SO WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL- DOLLARS FOR STAFF OR ANY RECOGNITION. OF THE STAFFING SHORTAGES THAT WE HAD AT THE TIME BUT HAVING SAID ALL THAT WE'RE COMMITTED. TO ADMINISTERING THIS PROGRAM ACCORDING TO- YOU KNOW THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PROGRAM AND THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE WORKING. TO RESPOND TO THAT AUDIT AS WE SPEAK RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT. AND I TO ME THIS THE SOLUTION QUITE SIMPLE MOV THAT MONEY BACK OVER. TO BE ADMINISTERED BY THE- THE CD THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BECAUSE THEY HAVE EXPERIENCE DOING IT IN FACT. THEY AND HAVE THOSE ONES HAVE THE C. T. FUNDS ANNUALLY. ARE DOLED OUT BY CD THEY HAVE THE LOGISTICS THEY HAVE THE EXPERTISE THIS WOULD TAKE ONE PROGRAM OFF YOUR PLATE. OF THE MANY THAT YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN- SO I THINK I THINK THE WISE MOVE HERE. AS WE HEAD FORWARD IN THE BUDGET PROCESS IS TO MOVE THAT- FUNDING BACK OVER JUST WALKED OVER TO CDP WHEREIN THEY ALREADY ADMINISTER A GOOD AMOUNT OF MONEY I AND I SHARE. YOUR YOUR RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF C. T. AS OF C. T. S. AS A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER FOR A LOT OF KIDS THAT'S THEIR HOOK IN SCHOOL THAT'S OUR HOOK. SO WE NEED TO GET THESE MONIES OUT IN AN EFFICIENT MANNER. AND I THINK YOU. MISTER DANCER OKAY THANK YOU- MR MCCORMACK YOU MISTER MEDINA THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIR- MAYBE START WITH- GRAY IF I COULD- AND MAYBE BEFORE THE QUESTION JUST LET ME REITERATE WHAT I'VE HEARD HERE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF A BOLD INVESTMENT BOLD INVESTMENT AT ALL OUR LEVELS OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND THE- THE PAYOFF THAT WE GET. ON THAT INVESTMENT COULDN'T AGREE MORE WITH THE HEADS OF ALL THREE OF OUR SEGMENTS BUT. PROGRAM AND I'M LOOKING THAT MANY OF THE STUDENTS ARE HAVE LEFT NOW FROM UC BERKELEY- THE NUMBER HERE AND I DID HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH THEM BEFORE OUR OUR SUB TO MEETING- I HAPPENED TO BE A TEACHER WHO WORKED IN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. BOTH AS A CORRECTIONAL OFFICER IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES THAT- SOLEDAD AND THEN AS A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER ADULT EDUCATION TEACHER THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION FOR WOMEN CIW RIGHT TAUGHT FOR TWO YEARS. AND TEACHING AND JUST TO YEARS AT SEA I W. I UNFORTUNATELY SAW THE RECIDIVISM THAT WE HAVE WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS THE NUMBER OF WOMEN THAT I SAW LEAVE AND COME BACK. IN THE TWO YEARS THAT I WAS THERE. AND WE NOW HAVE PROGRAMS AT ALL THREE LEVELS OF OUR HIGHER EDUCATION WE HAVE A PROGRAMS AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE THE RISING SCHOLARS WERE WE PUT IN TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET TO INCREASE THEIR PROGRAM. I HAVE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE CSU. THE C. ISSUES- RAJIT REBOUND THAT WE PUT IN IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET THREE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS AND I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE GRADUATION CEREMONY AT CAL STATE FULLERTON. AND THOSE STUDENTS. AND THOSE OF FORMERLY INCARCERATED STUDENTS THAT PARTICIPATED IN PROJECT REBOUND ANY PROUDER OF ANY OF OUR STUDENTS KNOW OUR OF CSU AND THE PRESIDENT OF CAL STATE FULLERTON FOR HIS COMMITMENT TO THAT PROGRAM- CAL STATE FULLERTON HAS A- HOUSING PROGRAM. WHERE THE FORMER INCARCERATED STUDENTS- CAN LIVE AND GET THE SUPPORT AND WE PUT IN MONEY AND THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET TO REPLICATE THAT PROGRAM ADDED ANOTHER CSU. SO THE STUDENTS ARE HERE THIS AFTERNOON ASKING US THE LEGISLATURE AND UC. TWO FOUR FOUR MILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONLY SEGMENT WHERE WE HAVE NOT SEEN INVESTMENT. AND I WILL- PUSH FOR THAT FOUR MILLION DOLLAR. INCLUSION IN THE STATE BUDGET WHICH IS NOT NOW REFLECTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ANALYST ASKED MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT ME IN THAT ASK. NOT A LOT OF MONEY BUT THE MOST EFFICIENT USE OF MONEY BECAUSE ALL THESE PROGRAMS HAVE SUCCESS AND MOST OF THESE PROGRAMS HAVE ZERO RECIDIVISM AND THEIR PROGRAM SO I SUPPORT THE ASK OF THE STUDENTS WHO ARE HERE FROM UC BERKELEY AND UC IRVINE AND WILL PASS THAT WE PUT IN FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN THE STATE BUDGET. TO FUND THE UNDERGROUND SCHOLARS PROGRAM AND I DON'T KNOW IF PRESIDENT DRAKE IF YOU COULD GIVE ME A SHORT RESPONSE TO THE STUDENTS REQUEST AM AND- THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MR NEED RIGHT NICE TO SEE YOU AND I HAD THE POP PRIVILEGE OF VISITING ABOUT THOSE WITH THAT ENOUGH FOR THE SAME STUDENTS PRIVATE THAT DEMOCRATS CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY- EARLIER THIS- THIS YEAR IN OCTOBER I WAS THERE ACTUALLY ONE OF MY FIRST VISITS TO A CAMPUS- WE WERE ALLOWING PEOPLE TO BE ON CAMPUS AND HAD A GREAT- THE GREAT TIME VISITING WITH THE MIKE BREY WITH THE MOST EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT PROGRAM. THAT'S IT AT IRVINE MAYOR THING CALLED THE ORANGE WHAT SCHOLARS PROGRAM NOT QUITE THE SAME AS A WHILE AGO THAT I WAS THERE THIS IS A PROGRAM FOR FOSTER YOUTH THAN WE HAD OF A SPECIAL WELCOMING CEREMONY THEN WE HAD A GRADUATION CEREMONY A SPECIAL PRIVATE GRADUATION CEREMONY FOR THOSE FOSTER YOUTH IN ADDITION TO THE BROADER GRADUATION CEREMONY AND I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF PARTICIPATING IN THAT CEREMONY CEREMONY WOULD HAVE SIX OR EIGHT STUDENTS AND IT COMPARED TO THE THOUSANDS THAT WE HAD WITH THE OTHERS BUT WE GOT TOGETHER WITH THEM AND REALLY. CELEBRATED THE INCREDIBLE PATHWAY THAT THEY HAD TAKEN TO GET ADMITTED TO THE UNIVERSITY AND THAT THE PROCESS THROUGH AND GRADUATE THAT THAT PROGRAM HAS GROWN- IN IN THE FIRST YEAR SO HAPPY TO HEAR THAT BURKE THE ENTERPRISE WERE REPRESENTED FOR YOU TODAY AND I'LL SAY THAT OUR AND OUR PROPOSAL- TO THE GOVERNOR WE HAD ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AND WE PUT TWO PROFESSORS ARE PROGRAMS TOGETHER AND THIS WAS ON. A PROGRAM FOR PARTIALLY IMPACTED STUDENTS AND FOSTER YOUTH OUT AMONG OUR MOST VULNERABLE AND CHALLENGE STUDENTS THE ABOUT GOVERNOR OF BUDGET ARE REFLECTED THIS THAT OUT LOWER AMOUNT AND NARROWED THE SCOPE A BIT BUT WE HAD REQUESTED THAT A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY SO THAT WE COULD INCLUDE MORE SUPPORT SERVICES FOR PARTIALLY IMPACTED THAT STUDENTS AND FOR FOSTER STUDENTS TONIGHT AGREE WITH YOU THAT EVERY ONE OF THEM WHO SUCCEEDS AS A GREAT TRIUMPH FOR THE. UNIVERSITY OF A GREAT SUCCESS FOR SOCIETY. THANK YOU PRESENT REAGAN I WOULD ON SAY THAT. I KNOW BECAUSE I'VE MET. WITH STOOD THAT USE RIVER. FORMERLY AND- STUDENTS WHO ARE PART OF THE PROGRAM AS WELL. WHO ARE TRYING TO WORK. OUT WITH WITH THIS PROGRAM TO. KIND OF GET STARTED. AT UC RIVERSIDE WHICH AS YOU KNOW I REPRESENT. SO AND THEN AND LASTLY. YOU KNOW JUST THE INCREDIBLE SUCCESS WITH THE STUDENTS I'VE HAD. GOING ON TO GRADUATE SCHOOL A MEETING ONE HERE THIS AFTERNOON WHO. WILL GO ON TO LAW SCHOOL IT'S JUST AN INCREDIBLE PROGRAM. MANY OF THEM AS I SAY GO ON TO GRADUATE SCHOOL AND- GET P. H. D.'S GET A MAYES SO I WHOLEHEARTEDLY. SUPPORT THE REQUEST THANK YOU PRESIDENT DRAKE. AND IF I COULD. DIRECT ONE QUESTION TO CHANCELLOR OAKLEY. CHANCER AUBREY- AS YOU KNOW WE'RE DOING A LOT THIS YEAR AND HOUSING ESPECIALLY FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND- WE HAVE THAT LEGISLATION BY ASSEMBLY MCCARTY IN MYSELF TO INCREASE HOUSING- ESPECIALLY THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHICH THEY AUTOS THEY DESPERATELY NEED. CHANCER OAKLEY WHAT OBSTACLES MIGHT THERE BE THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE FACING. ANY PROBLEMS THAT THE COMMUNICATORS ARE EXPERIENCING IN GETTING. THE MONEY TO- TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES CHANCELLOR OAKLEY. OR IF WE MOVE FORWARD ANY ANY. ISSUES THAT YOU MIGHT FORESEE. BUT IT THANK YOU FOR THAT- CHAIR MEDINA IS WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU IF NOT IN PERSON- AS YOU KNOW YOU'RE VERY WELL AWARE THAT OUR THAT OUR CAMPUSES ARE- HUNGRY FOR STUDENT HOUSING GIVEN THE- ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF ALARMING AMOUNT OF- HOUSING INSECURITY THAT EXIST IN OUR SYSTEM. SO WE ARE WORKING HARD TO- WORK WITH- R. SEVENTY- THREE DISTRICTS TO COME UP WITH A COMMON WAY OF APPROACHING THIS IN TO BUILD THE INTERNAL CAPACITY TO HELP THE SYSTEM. WHICH IS NOT TRADITIONALLY- OVERSEEING STUDENT HOUSING BUT NOW- THERE IS A CONSENSUS THAT THIS IS THE DIRECTION WE NEED TO MOVE AND I SUPPORT THAT. DIRECTION SO. I KNOW THAT EXECUTIVE VICE CHANCELLOR SAID NEVER READ GOING TO YOU KNOW WELL IS WORKING HARD TO. LOWER THE BARRIERS FOR OUR FOR OUR COLLEGES I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW. ONE OF THE CONCERNS ONCE WE DO BUILD A BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT WE ARE ON OUR WAY TO BUILDING MORE STUDENT HOUSING. IS HOW STUDENTS ACTUALLY PAY FOR THAT HOUSING AND CERTAINLY THE EFFORTS THAT WE'RE MAKING A ROUND CAL GRANT REFORM THE EFFORTS THAT WE'RE MAKING TO INCREASE PELL FOR COMMITTEE COSTUMES. ESPECIALLY FOR TALKING STUDENTS WILL BE IMPORTANT TO HELPING TO PAY FOR THE HOUSING- BUT- I WILL- MAKE SURE THAT EXECUTIVE VICE CHANCELLOR NAVARETTE- COMMUNICATES YOUR OFFICE ANY CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE HAVING. I THINK THE MAIN CHALLENGES THIS IS NEW FOR OUR SYSTEM WE'RE TRYING TO COORDINATE IN SUPPORT OF OUR COLLEGES- WE ARE VERY DISPERSES THURMOND UNLIKE THE CSU IN THE UC. WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR SEVENTY THREE DISTRICT TO PARTICIPATE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE ALL SEVENTY THREE HAVE DIFFERENT- CHALLENGES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM. AN EXPEDITE- THE RESOURCES THE MUCH AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU CHANCELLOR. THANK YOU MR MEDINA CORRECT IS- A PILOT A COUPLE YEAR ISSUE SO FIRST OF ALL THE- THE PROGRAMS FOR THE FORMERLY INCARCERATED 100% HOW WE'RE ALL IN ON THOSE- WE DID THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ONE LAST YEAR RISING SCHOLARS ON GOING SO WE SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THAT BUT THE REALLY THE PERSON WE SHOULD BE TALKING TO IS MISTER DRAKE HITS. YOU KNOW MAINTAINING THE SPEAKER AND ATKINS WORDS ARE TURNED OUT TO FUND OUR PRIORITIES SO THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- PUT THIS IN OUR PLAN. OKAY VERY HAPPY TO HEAR THAT AND WHEN I DRESSED IT TO PRESENT DRAKE I WAS JUST KIND OF LOOK AT NINE FOUR NINE. NUMBER GLAD TO HEAR YEAH WELL MY GOODNESS HIS HIS ROLLS OVER IN THIS PART NOW IT'S UP TO US. TO DO IT. RIGHT AND THEN FOR THIS ON. YEAH I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES HOUSING. IT'S OUR ROLE IN THIS INTO THE CHANCELLOR. WORRY SENSUALLY THE BANK USED TO GARA BORROW MONEY FROM WALL STREET THINK THEY CHARGE YOU HIGH INTEREST RATES AND THIS AND THAT AND THEY- YOU KNOW HE HAD TO. LEVERAGE A LOT JUST TO GET THE MONEY AND SO OUR ROLE IS TO JUST BE THE MIDDLE PERSON TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. THAT LANDING I'M NOT SURE THAT WE'RE IN THE POSITION TO. TO HELP PROVIDE FURTHER SUBSIDIZED HOUSING AND BITE ON THE COSTS BUT- YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE GONNA BUILD A PROJECT POTENTIALLY GO BORROW MONEY FROM- WALL STREET OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THIS IS AN OPTION TO DO IT. AT A MUCH CHEAPER RATE 0% INTEREST. AND ITS REVOLVING LOAN FUND SO. THE MONEY WILL GO BACK INTO DOING MORE HOUSING. FOR THE DECADES TOGETHER SO- I THANK WILL BE CLEAR THAT'S WHAT IT IS IT'S NOT TO. TO DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT OTHER THAN THAT- WITH THAT SOMEONE EMBRACE. THANK YOU MISTER. OF PRESIDENT REAGAN THE CHANCELLOR CASTRO SO GOOD TO BE BACK HERE ON THE SCREEN WITH YOU AND CHANCELLOR ORTIZ OAKLEY IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK FROM DC. GLAD YOU WERE THERE FOR THE PRESIDENT BUT WE'RE GLAD TO HAVE YOU BACK HERE IN CALIFORNIA. MY BIGGEST CONCERN HAS TO DO WITH THE GRADUATION RATES AND THE GAPS IN GRADUATION RATE FOR OUR MINORITY STUDENTS. OUR UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT FOSTER YOUTH THE FORMERLY INCARCERATED. WHAT IS IT THAT WE NEED TO DO WE'VE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT THE SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM I KNOW THAT AT CAL POLY POMONA DR REDFORD REESE HAS A SIMILAR PROGRAM WITH. THAT CHAIN WAS TO DO FOR MANAGING INSTITUTE FOR WOMEN. WHAT IS IT ONE OF THE SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS BESIDES THE USE THAT WE NEED TO WORK ON AND WHAT IS THE COST. ASSOCIATED WITH A PROVIDING THE SUPPORT THAT YOU NEED TO CLOSE THE GRADUATION GAP. AND THIS I WOULD ADDRESS TO EACH OF YOU IF YOU COULD JUST ADDRESS IT BRIEFLY. I'M HAPPY TO JUMP IN HERE. ASSEMBLY WOMAN NICE TO SEE YOU AND I WELCOME YOUR QUESTION BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS ONE OF OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND MY HIGHEST PRIORITY AS CHANCELLOR IS TO ELIMINATE THESE EQUITY GAPS ONCE AND FOR ALL AND FOR THE CSU- IT HAS TO DO WITH- SUPPORTING OUR STUDENTS YOUR GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WHICH I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE OF. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO INCREASE OUR GRADUATION RATES DRAMATICALLY- OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IN FACT OUR FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE IS UP SIXTY THREE PERCENT- SINCE WE STARTED THIS PROGRAM AND WE JUST HAD A THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF GRADUATES IN OUR HISTORY ABOUT A HUNDRED. AND THIRTY THREE THOUSAND GRADUATES IN MAY BUT WE STILL HAVE MUCH MORE WORK TO DO AND IN OUR BUDGET REQUEST IS A SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS- OF PERMANENT FUNDING THAT WE WOULD USE TO HIRE MORE FACULTY. FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS WHO ARE CULTURALLY COMPETENT AND UNDERSTAND THE DIVERSE STUDENTS THAT WE SERVE A MORE ACADEMIC ADVISORS AND A RANGE OF STRATEGIES THAT HAVE COME OUT OF THE WORKING GROUP THAT I SET UP IMMEDIATELY AFTER I BEGAN AS CHANCELLOR I'LL GIVE YOU THE FIVE PRIORITY AREAS OF THAT WORKING GROUP JUST VERY BRIEFLY. NUMBER ONE IS TO RE ENGAGE AND RE ENROLL ARE UNDERSERVED STUDENTS WE'VE BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN REACHING OUT TO THE STUDENTS WHO- THE LEFT US AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC- MAYBE EVEN BEFORE THAT AND WELCOMING THEM BACK TO CAMPUS AND WE'VE HAD SOME VERY GOOD SUCCESS. AT MANY OF OUR CAMPUSES ARE WE WANT TO EXPAND CREDIT OPPORTUNITIES- FOR SUMMER AND INTERCESSIONS SO THAT OUR STUDENTS CAN TAKE CLASSES DURING THOSE PERIODS OF TIME AND MAKE PROGRESS MORE QUICKLY- ENSURE ADEQUATE FULL ACCESS TO DIGITAL DEGREE ROAD MAPS SO THAT OUR STUDENTS. KNOW WHAT THEY NEED TO DO WHEN AND HOW AND IT'S- IT'S DIGITAL AND IT'S A SUPPORT TOOL FOR THEM- AND PROVIDES NUDGES TO THEM TO DO CERTAIN THINGS ATCERTAIN TIMES. WE'RE GONNA ELIMINATE ADMINISTRATIVE BARRIERS TO GRADUATION- AND THERE THERE ARE STILL SOME OF THOSE DESPITE OUR EFFORTS. AND I'M COMMITTED WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO ELIMINATING THOSE KINDS OF BARRIERS SO THAT OUR STUDENTS CAN GRADUATE. IN A TIMELY WAY AND THEN FINALLY PROMOTING EQUITABLE LEARNING PRACTICES AND REDUCING THE NUMBERS OF DEASON ABSENT WITHDRAWALS IN SOME OF OUR COURSES. THAT ARE ACTING. UNFORTUNATELY AS BARRIERS AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY THAT'S THE CASE AND IT WORKED OUT BY CUTTING ANY CORNERS ACADEMICALLY BUT WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR STUDENTS. HAVE THE TOOLS AND SUPPORT TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND I'D BE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU MORE INFORMATION LATER ABOUT THESE EFFORTS AND OTHER ONES THAT WERE UNDERTAKING. THANK YOU TRANSFERRED. MAYBE ALL OF US SPEAK UP NEXT TO SAY GREAT AND VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION AND VERY IMPORTANT PRIORITY FOR UP FOR US AS WELL AND LET ME ACTUALLY CONGRATULATED CHANCELLOR CASTRO AND HIS PREDECESSOR FOR- REALLY- IT INCREDIBLE SUCCESS OF THIS LAST DECADE IN INCREASING THE FOREIGN SIX YEAR GRADUATION RATES AT THAT THE CSU AND NOW THAT SOMETHING THAT STUCK TO GAIN NATIONAL ATTENTION AND APPRECIATE THAT I I'LL SAY THAT I HAVE TO EFFORTS THAT WE'VE WORKED ON AS WE LOOK TOWARD ELIMINATING THESE GAPS OVER THE NEXT DECADE AS WELL AS- I MENTION OUR GOAL OF INCREASING. THE SIZE OF OUR OUR UNDERGRADUATE VIRGINIA STUDENT POPULATION BY TWENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS OVER THE NEXT DECADE THAT INCLUDES AND THEN INCREASING THE SIZE OF OUR FACULTY TO TEACH THOSE STUDENTS AS WE FOCUS ON THE INCREASE IN OUR FACULTY WE ARE GOING TO BE DISPROPORTIONATELY FOCUSED ON INCREASING THE DIVERSITY OF OUR FACULTY WHICH HAS LAGGED BEHIND OUR OTHER EFFORTS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF MAKING SURE THAT OUR UNIVERSITY IN TWENTY THIRTY IS NOT ONLY LARGER BUT ALSO BROADLY FROM STUDENTS THROUGH FACULTY MORE REPRESENTATIVE. COUPLE OF PROGRAMS THAT WE PARTICIPATED IN OVER THE YEARS THAT HAVE HAVE A TERM REALLY GREAT SUCCESS AND BUT. WE ARE CONTINUING TO EXPAND BEEN IN ADDITION. BUT USE YOUR BOB I WAS TO. THERE AND THE GOAL IS TO JUST THE THINGS THAT- JEFF CASTRO MENTION THAT IS TO. LOOK AT THOSE PLACES. IMPAIR YOUR COURSES WHERE WE HAD DIFFERENCE LET. BETWEEN STUDENTS WHO CAME FROM MARGINALIZED AND MINORITY RIGHTS THEN DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS AND THE MEAN. I KNOW THAT GOD THE LAST THAT I WILL HAVE A FROM A YEAR OR SO AGO AND TWO YEARS AGO I SAY AND- THE BLACK WHITE. DIFFERENTIAL IN A GRADUATION- THAT ACHIEVEMENT HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED ESSENTIALLY AT THAT CAMPUS TO IT SO DIFFICULT LEVEL SO THAT IS GREAT THERE WERE STILL SOME OTHER. IF YOU LOOK MORE GRANULAR THERE WERE STILL SOME OTHER CHALLENGES BUT WE SAW THAT A REAL FOCUS ON PROJECT THE- BARRIER COURSES AND UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION. COULD HELP YOU TO REALLY ACHIEVE. ELIMINATE THOSE THAT GAPS BY INCREASING THE SUCCESS OF THOSE STUDENTS WHO BURKE WERE FALLING BEHIND. AT A CHANCE TO PARTICIPATE FOR. SIX YEARS AS A YEAH FIRST BEGINNING MEMBER AND THEN AS THAT COMING ON OVERSEEING PROBLEM SUPPORTER OF A THING CALLED UNIVERSITY INNOVATION ALLIANCE IT WAS A- NATIONAL EFFORT. LOOKED AT ELIMINATING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AND RAISING THE- LEVEL OF GRADUATION OF THE UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE- COUNTRY THAT PLACE THAT I WAS INCREASED ITS GRADUATION. RATE BY EIGHTEEN PERCENT. OVER THAT TIME THAT WE WERE THERE DURING THAT UC RIVERSIDE IS A PART OF THAT THAT IT FOCUSES ON. THAT'S THE THINGS THAT THE GAME CHANCELLOR CASTRO'S MENTION FOCUSES ON. MAKING SURE TO HAVE THE APPROPRIATE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR FACULTY. HELPING TEACHERS WHO ARE ALREADY GREAT TEACHERS BE EVEN BETTER TEACHERS FOR TEACHING TEACHERS TO TEACH BETTER WE COULD TALK MORE DETAIL ABOUT THAT- LATER. FOCUSING ON STUDENT ADVISING MAKING SURE THAT WE- THAT THE STUDENTS ARE SUPPORTED AND AIMED AND- AND NURTURED THROUGH THEIR PATHWAY- THROUGH THE COURSE SO THAT THEY- CAN. REALLY BE HELPED TO BE SUCCESSFUL FROM THE VERY VERY BEGINNING YOU CANNOT WAIT UNTIL SOMEONE. GETS A BAD GRADE ON A MID TERM OR FINALLY SAY GOSH THERE ARE SOMETHING WRONG. YOU START VERY EARLY WITH LOS. QUIZZES AND WITHIN THE FIRST WEEK OUR FIRST TWO OUT TO GIVE STUDENTS ABOUT FEEDBACK OVERALL. AND THEN REALLY CELEBRATING THIS THAT'S THE- HAVE ALL THE CAPS FOCUS. ON THOSE PLACES WHERE THERE ARE TREATMENT CAPS AND HAVING THE ELIMINATION OF ACHIEVEMENT GAPS OF BRITAIN INTO THE- EVALUATION CRITERIA FOR OUR CHANCELLORS AND- WE ARE VERY THAT. VERY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO ELIMINATE THOSE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AND THEN RAISE THE GRADUATION. RATES FOR OVER VERY ARE BROADRIDGE BREAKS OUT THANKFULLY ARE ARE RANKED AMONG THE HIGHEST IN THE- COUNTRY BUT THEY'RE STILL ACHIEVEMENT GAPS THAT WE WANT TO ELIMINATE AND AS WE DO THAT. OVERALL RITUAL RISE EVEN HIGHER THANK YOU MEMBER IS WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU. THE CLOSING OF EQUITY GAPS IS A FUNDAMENTAL- OVERARCHING THEME IN THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS VISION FOR SUCCESS- SO I'D SAY THERE'S A FEW THINGS THAT. I THINK- WITH YOUR PARTNERSHIP WE CAN DO TO CONTINUE TO CLOSE THESE GAPS ONE IS ME. TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT STUDENTS BASIC NEEDS THEY CONTINUE TO FOCUS EFFORTS. ON IMPROVING ACCESS TO CAL GRANT OR STUDENTS I KNOW YOU ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH OUR STUDENTS- DAY- CONTINUE TO ACCESS AND HAVE HAVE LESS ACCESS TO THE COVERAGE JUST THEM. THEN THERE APPEARS IN THIS ISSUE IN THE YEARS SINCE A WEEK AGO- THAT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART IN THE CLOSING EQUITY GAPS- SO WE HOPE THAT- WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES. ON IMPROVING THE CAL GRANTS IS DONE AND SUPPORTING THE BASIC NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS. I ALSO THINK THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO SUPPORT- OF FUNDAMENTAL REFORMS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT INTO MOTION OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS IT'S A POOR CLOSING EQUITY GAPS WE'VE SEEN. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THOSE AREAS BASED ON THESE REFORMS AND THAT WOULD BE SUPPORT FOR THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA. WHICH WE HAVE DOCUMENTED EVIDENCE THAT IT IS IMPROVING- THE TARGETING OF FUNDS TO PROGRAMS THAT. SUPPORT CLOSING EQUITY GAPS. ALSO REFORMS LIKE ASSEMBLY BILL SEVEN FIVE- AS WELL AS THE GUIDED. REYES AND THEN ALSO THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AROUND IS SUCH A DEGREE FOR TRANSFER WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENT FOR STUDENTS SO THEY CAN ACHIEVE TRANSFER TO THE CSU INTO THE UC AS WELL AS OUR A. I. C. C. PARTNERS. I WILL SAY THAT IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT AS- FOR FACULTY AND STAFF IMPROVE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT ACHIEVED THE AGREED FOR TRANSFER. OVER CAUCUS IN THE FUNDING CAPACITY AT THE CSU AND UC FOR TRANSFER- AND THEN FINALLY I'D SAY- AND AS IMPORTANTLY. THAT WE DIVERSIFY OUR FACULTY AND STAFF SO THAT STUDENTS SEE THEMSELVES IN THE CLASSROOM AND ON CAMPUS. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH MY I DO RECALL THE FIRST TIME WE WERE ALL TALKING ABOUT SOME O THESE ISSUES. THE ONE WORD THAT CONTINUED TO BE SHARED WITH EQUITY AND I WANT TO THANK THE THREE OF YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND KEEPING EQUITY AT THE TOP OF THE LIST.
