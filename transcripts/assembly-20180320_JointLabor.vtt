ABOUT AUTOMATION.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.760 region:rollup2
I EN THERE IS BEEN MUCH

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:27.761 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE BENEFITS

CONCERNED. ABOUT DISPLACEMENT OF

JOBS AND WE THINK THAT THE

00:00:40.841 --> 00:00:44.945 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION SHOULD BE ABOUT HOW

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:46.179 region:rollup2
WE WORK TOGETHER ACROSS SECTORS.

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:48.081 region:rollup2
OUGHT TO USE THOSE TECHNOLOGY

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:49.550 region:rollup2
BENEFITS.

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:51.184 region:rollup2
BUT NOT IN A WAY THAT IS NEARLY

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.619 region:rollup2
ABOUT REPLACING OF THE WORK

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:54.454 region:rollup2
FORCE AND SO WE HOPE TO HAVE A

THE ISSUE OF AUTOMATION IN THE

THAT I THINK HAVE FUNDAMENTALLY

BE UNUSUAL BACKGROUND WHILE I

HAVE BEEN AN ACADEMIC FOR MOST

00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:52.165 region:rollup2
MY CAREER AND RECENTLY BECAME

DEAN AT. BRANDEIS.

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:55.869 region:rollup2
I HAD THE HONOR OF SERVING IN

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:57.604 region:rollup2
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AS THE

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:57.871 region:rollup2
HEAD OF THE WAGE AND HOUR

00:03:57.604 --> 00:03:59.239 region:rollup2
DIVISION.

00:03:57.871 --> 00:04:02.209 region:rollup2
AT THE LABOR DEPARTMENT WHERE I

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.810 region:rollup2
SAW MANY OF THESE CHANGES FIRST

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.912 region:rollup2
HAND. AS WE DID IN FORCE MEANT

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.280 region:rollup2
OF THE MINIMUM WAGE OVER TIME

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:09.282 region:rollup2
AND OUR OTHER BASIC LABOR

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.717 region:rollup2
STANDARDS OF FROM TWO THOUSAND

00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:11.985 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN TILL THE END OF THE

00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:13.787 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION.

00:04:11.985 --> 00:04:15.956 region:rollup2
AND THE COMMENTS I WANNA MAKE

00:04:13.787 --> 00:04:17.324 region:rollup2
ARE BASED BOTH ON RESEARCH THAT

00:04:15.956 --> 00:04:18.125 region:rollup2
I'VE DONE THAT OTHER PEOPLE

00:04:17.324 --> 00:04:20.827 region:rollup2
INCLUDING.

00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:22.362 region:rollup2
AND THAT A BURN HARD AND OTHERS

00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:24.498 region:rollup2
HAVE DONE ON CHANGES IN THE

00:04:22.362 --> 00:04:26.333 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE BUT ALSO DO REFLECT.

00:04:24.498 --> 00:04:27.767 region:rollup2
WHAT WE FOUND VERY CLEARLY

00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:30.270 region:rollup2
DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:31.471 region:rollup2
ABOUT PATTERNS OF CHANGES IN THE

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.006 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE OF WORK AND THEIR

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:35.776 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS ON WORKING PEOPLE

00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:37.444 region:rollup2
ON THE VIOLATION? OF MANY OF OUR

00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:39.146 region:rollup2
MOST BASIC LABOR STANDARDS.

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:40.847 region:rollup2
THE MAIN POINTS I'D MAKE AND

00:04:39.146 --> 00:04:42.282 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE IF I COULD TAKE MY

00:04:40.847 --> 00:04:43.817 region:rollup2
TIME TO MAKE MY MAIN POINTS AND

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:45.318 region:rollup2
THEN GIVE ONE ILLUSTRATION THAT

00:04:43.817 --> 00:04:47.020 region:rollup2
I THINK SPEAKS TO. THE

00:04:45.318 --> 00:04:48.788 region:rollup2
TRANSFORMATION IS.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.657 region:rollup2
MANY OF US IN ACADEMICS HAVE

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:53.393 region:rollup2
BEEN INVOLVED IN HAD TENDED.

00:04:50.657 --> 00:04:55.829 region:rollup2
FUTURE OF WORK CONVENING SO

00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:57.430 region:rollup2
OVER THE LAST A NUMBER OF YEARS

00:04:55.829 --> 00:04:59.599 region:rollup2
OFTEN FOCUSED ON THE ISSUES OF

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.101 region:rollup2
AUTOMATION IN ARTIFICIAL

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:01.802 region:rollup2
INTELLIGENCE IN THEIR IMPACTS.

00:05:01.101 --> 00:05:04.004 region:rollup2
ON LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT.

00:05:01.802 --> 00:05:05.338 region:rollup2
.

00:05:04.004 --> 00:05:06.640 region:rollup2
WELL THAT IS INCREDIBLY

00:05:05.338 --> 00:05:07.974 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT OBVIOUSLY WILL BE THE

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.443 region:rollup2
SUBJECT OF A LOT OF TODAY'S

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:11.878 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION. I WOULD ALSO MAKE

00:05:10.443 --> 00:05:13.647 region:rollup2
THE POINT THAT THE FUTURE OF

00:05:11.878 --> 00:05:15.415 region:rollup2
WORK IS ALREADY HERE AND THERE

00:05:13.647 --> 00:05:17.017 region:rollup2
HAS ALREADY BEEN A PROFOUND

00:05:15.415 --> 00:05:18.718 region:rollup2
TRANSFORMATION IN.

00:05:17.017 --> 00:05:20.520 region:rollup2
THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP THAT

00:05:18.718 --> 00:05:22.255 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR PROBABLY

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.890 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE YEARS BUT

00:05:22.255 --> 00:05:25.458 region:rollup2
ACCELERATED AFTER THE GREAT

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.460 region:rollup2
RECESSION. AND.

00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:28.929 region:rollup2
I'VE TURNED THIS CHANGE THE

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.497 region:rollup2
FEATURED WORKPLACE IN THE

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:31.264 region:rollup2
FEATURED WORKPLACE.

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:33.366 region:rollup2
IT IS REALLY.

00:05:31.264 --> 00:05:35.101 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES REORGANIZING.

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:36.837 region:rollup2
.

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:38.872 region:rollup2
FOCUSING ON ONE HAND MORE AND

00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:40.874 region:rollup2
MORE ON CORE COMPETENCIES AND BY

00:05:38.872 --> 00:05:43.276 region:rollup2
CORE COMPETENCIES I MEAN THINGS

00:05:40.874 --> 00:05:45.145 region:rollup2
LIKE BRANDING THEIR PRODUCTS.

00:05:43.276 --> 00:05:46.079 region:rollup2
BRINGING NEW PRODUCTS TO MARKET

00:05:45.145 --> 00:05:47.647 region:rollup2
DOING THINGS LIKE LOOK

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:48.682 region:rollup2
DELIVERING OUR PACKAGES TO OUR

00:05:47.647 --> 00:05:50.750 region:rollup2
HOME.

00:05:48.682 --> 00:05:52.219 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME AS THEY'VE BEEN

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.919 region:rollup2
DOING THAT THEY HAVE ALSO BEEN.

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:56.056 region:rollup2
VERY.

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:57.224 region:rollup2
INCREASINGLY SHIFTING WORK OUT

00:05:56.056 --> 00:05:59.526 region:rollup2
OF THEIR OWN EMPLOYMENT

00:05:57.224 --> 00:06:00.927 region:rollup2
SUBCONTRACTING WORK FRANCHISING

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:02.929 region:rollup2
WORK USING THIRD PARTY

00:06:00.927 --> 00:06:05.632 region:rollup2
CONTRACTORS. TO AN EXTENT THAT

00:06:02.929 --> 00:06:07.601 region:rollup2
PEOPLE DON'T OFTEN PERCEIVED.

00:06:05.632 --> 00:06:09.603 region:rollup2
JUST HOW MANY PEOPLE WHO WE

00:06:07.601 --> 00:06:12.072 region:rollup2
THINK ARE AMAZON EMPLOYEES WHO

00:06:09.603 --> 00:06:13.607 region:rollup2
WE THINK ARE EMPLOYEES OF. A

00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:15.308 region:rollup2
COMPANIES LIKE APPLE WHO ARE NO

00:06:13.607 --> 00:06:16.810 region:rollup2
LONGER ACTUALLY THOSE DIRECT

00:06:15.308 --> 00:06:19.346 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES EVEN THOSE COMPANIES

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:21.615 region:rollup2
DIRECT THE DAY TO DAY ACTIVITIES

00:06:19.346 --> 00:06:23.316 region:rollup2
AND IT IS IN THAT CONTEXT OF

00:06:21.615 --> 00:06:25.385 region:rollup2
MAJOR CHANGES.

00:06:23.316 --> 00:06:27.020 region:rollup2
THAT AUTOMATION. THE USE OF

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:28.722 region:rollup2
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.689 region:rollup2
OTHER OF TE AT THE TRENDS THAT

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:32.092 region:rollup2
ON YOU WILL ALSO BE SPEAKING

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:33.827 region:rollup2
ABOUT ARE TAKING PLACE IN. AND

00:06:32.092 --> 00:06:36.596 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THAT I WOULD SAY SOME

00:06:33.827 --> 00:06:39.099 region:rollup2
OF THE IMPACTS OF THOSE CHANGES.

00:06:36.596 --> 00:06:40.734 region:rollup2
ON EARNINGS ON WAGES ON

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:43.103 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE WITH OUR LABOR LAWS

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:44.771 region:rollup2
ON ACCESSIBILITY TO BAN BENEFITS

00:06:43.103 --> 00:06:46.106 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN AMPLIFIED IN MAKE WORK

00:06:44.771 --> 00:06:47.274 region:rollup2
MADE WORSE.

00:06:46.106 --> 00:06:49.676 region:rollup2
SO LET ME.

00:06:47.274 --> 00:06:51.645 region:rollup2
JUST QUICKLY ILLUSTRATE WHAT I

00:06:49.676 --> 00:06:53.513 region:rollup2
MEAN BY THE FEATURED WORKPLACE I

00:06:51.645 --> 00:06:55.015 region:rollup2
COULD GIVE YOU EXAMPLES FROM

00:06:53.513 --> 00:06:56.149 region:rollup2
VIRTUALLY EVERY INDUSTRY.

00:06:55.015 --> 00:06:57.751 region:rollup2
AND I COULD GIVE YOU EXAMPLES

00:06:56.149 --> 00:07:00.654 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY AFFECTING LOW WAGE

00:06:57.751 --> 00:07:02.222 region:rollup2
WORKERS BUT INCREASINGLY WORKERS

00:07:00.654 --> 00:07:03.957 region:rollup2
WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF SKILLED

00:07:02.222 --> 00:07:04.791 region:rollup2
WORKERS EVEN WITH GRADUATE

00:07:03.957 --> 00:07:07.761 region:rollup2
DEGREES.

00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:09.562 region:rollup2
EVEN LAWYERS ARE BEING AFFECTED

00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:11.698 region:rollup2
BY BY THESE CHANGES BUT THEY

00:07:09.562 --> 00:07:13.633 region:rollup2
PROFOUNDLY HIT WORKING PEOPLE

00:07:11.698 --> 00:07:16.102 region:rollup2
WHO ARE OF LOWER WAGES AND OFTEN

00:07:13.633 --> 00:07:17.504 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE A LOT OF RESOURCES.

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:18.972 region:rollup2
IN THE EXAMPLE I WANT TO GIVE

00:07:17.504 --> 00:07:20.974 region:rollup2
YOU IS FROM RETAILING.

00:07:18.972 --> 00:07:22.976 region:rollup2
AYE HUGE TRANSFORMATION IN THE

00:07:20.974 --> 00:07:25.445 region:rollup2
WAY THAT GOODS ARE BROUGHT TO

00:07:22.976 --> 00:07:27.480 region:rollup2
STORES AND MORE RECENTLY TO OUR

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:29.516 region:rollup2
OWN FRONT DOORS A BECAUSE OF A

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.051 region:rollup2
TRANSFORMATION OF THAT I'VE BEEN

00:07:29.516 --> 00:07:32.852 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT. THE PICTURE THE

00:07:31.051 --> 00:07:35.021 region:rollup2
SLIDE I HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU IS

00:07:32.852 --> 00:07:37.357 region:rollup2
OF A DISTRIBUTION CENTER OF A

00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:38.525 region:rollup2
MAJOR RETAILER. ODDS TO PART OF

00:07:37.357 --> 00:07:40.360 region:rollup2
RETAIL DISTRIBUTION WE OFTEN

00:07:38.525 --> 00:07:42.429 region:rollup2
DON'T SEE BUT IT'S REALLY THE

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.331 region:rollup2
HEART OF MODERN RETELLING OF

00:07:42.429 --> 00:07:46.599 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES CALLED LEAN RETELLING.

00:07:44.331 --> 00:07:47.867 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU HAVE ON ONE HAND ON

00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:50.203 region:rollup2
ONE SIDE OF THAT BIG BUILDING

00:07:47.867 --> 00:07:53.039 region:rollup2
TRUCKS COMING IN OF FROM

00:07:50.203 --> 00:07:55.008 region:rollup2
SUPPLIERS BRINGING GOODS OF THAT

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:57.077 region:rollup2
ARE DESTINED FOR THE STORES OF

00:07:55.008 --> 00:07:57.610 region:rollup2
THAT RETAILER? IN ON THE OTHER

00:07:57.077 --> 00:07:59.913 region:rollup2
SIDE OF THAT DISTRIBUTION

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:01.448 region:rollup2
CENTER.

00:07:59.913 --> 00:08:03.183 region:rollup2
AT WHAT'S CALLED THE CROSS

00:08:01.448 --> 00:08:04.951 region:rollup2
DOCKING FACILITY YOU ABOUT DOWN

00:08:03.183 --> 00:08:08.555 region:rollup2
TRUCKS THAT WILL BE DESTINED TO

00:08:04.951 --> 00:08:09.022 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC. US STORES WITH

00:08:08.555 --> 00:08:09.622 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC DELIVERIES.

00:08:09.022 --> 00:08:10.390 region:rollup2
THE CHANGE THAT HAPPENED IN

00:08:09.622 --> 00:08:12.092 region:rollup2
RETAILING IN THE NINETEEN

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:13.460 region:rollup2
NINETIES REALLY LED BY WALMART

00:08:12.092 --> 00:08:16.129 region:rollup2
BUT SPREADING ACROSS ENTIRE

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:18.198 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY WAS TO CHANGE WHAT WAS

00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:19.733 region:rollup2
USED TO BE CALLED THE WAREHOUSE

00:08:18.198 --> 00:08:21.434 region:rollup2
INTO A DISTRIBUTION CENTER.

00:08:19.733 --> 00:08:23.403 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU HAVE INCOMING

00:08:21.434 --> 00:08:24.471 region:rollup2
SHIPMENTS OF GOODS YOU CAN SEE

00:08:23.403 --> 00:08:26.973 region:rollup2
IN THE LOWER?

00:08:24.471 --> 00:08:30.010 region:rollup2
HERE ARE COMING IN.

00:08:26.973 --> 00:08:31.077 region:rollup2
ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS HIGHLY

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:33.580 region:rollup2
AUTOMATED INFORMATION

00:08:31.077 --> 00:08:35.849 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES WHERE THOSE GOODS

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:37.484 region:rollup2
ARE UNLOADED USUALLY FROM TRUCK

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:39.986 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES FROM CONTAINERS. BY

00:08:37.484 --> 00:08:41.755 region:rollup2
MANUAL LABOR BUT THEN QUIT ON

00:08:39.986 --> 00:08:44.391 region:rollup2
AUTOMATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

00:08:41.755 --> 00:08:45.725 region:rollup2
CONTROLLED SYSTEMS THAT MOVE

00:08:44.391 --> 00:08:48.361 region:rollup2
THOSE GOOD SOMETIMES WITHIN

00:08:45.725 --> 00:08:49.529 region:rollup2
THREE MINUTES TO OUTGOING DOCKS

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:51.030 region:rollup2
WHERE AGAIN INFORMATION

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:51.931 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY TELLS.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:53.700 region:rollup2
.

00:08:51.931 --> 00:08:54.300 region:rollup2
THE THE SYSTEM EXACTLY WHICH

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.102 region:rollup2
STORE THAT DELIVERY SHOULD GO

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.937 region:rollup2
TO.

00:08:56.102 --> 00:09:00.140 region:rollup2
POT SO YOU HAVE A LOT OF MANUAL

00:08:57.937 --> 00:09:01.207 region:rollup2
WORK ON THE INCOMING DECK A LOT

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.376 region:rollup2
OF MANUAL WORK ON THE OUTGOING

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:05.412 region:rollup2
DECK AND THEN VERY ADVANCED

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:07.547 region:rollup2
AUTOMATED SYSTEMS. UP THAT WHOLE

00:09:05.412 --> 00:09:10.016 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WORKS BECAUSE RETAILERS

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:11.251 region:rollup2
HAVE VERY SPECIFIC HIGHLY

00:09:10.016 --> 00:09:13.053 region:rollup2
TECHNICAL STANDARDS

00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:14.621 region:rollup2
THAT THEY NEED EVERYONE TO MAKE

00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:16.356 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S THE SUPPLIER OR THE

00:09:14.621 --> 00:09:17.023 region:rollup2
TRUCK DRIVERS WHO WERE COMING IN

00:09:16.356 --> 00:09:19.659 region:rollup2
AND OUT OF THE FACILITIES.

00:09:17.023 --> 00:09:20.593 region:rollup2
.

00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:22.362 region:rollup2
AND THOSE STANDARDS AND

00:09:20.593 --> 00:09:24.063 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS ARE DICTATED BY THE

00:09:22.362 --> 00:09:25.765 region:rollup2
BUSINESS STRATEGIES OF COMPANIES

00:09:24.063 --> 00:09:25.932 region:rollup2
WE KNOW WELL LIKE WALMART AND

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:27.567 region:rollup2
AND.

00:09:25.932 --> 00:09:29.269 region:rollup2
AMAZON.

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:31.304 region:rollup2
NOW WHAT HAS CHANGED

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:33.740 region:rollup2
DRAMATICALLY IN THE LAST FIFTEEN

00:09:31.304 --> 00:09:35.341 region:rollup2
YEARS IS WHO DOES THAT WORK AND

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.343 region:rollup2
WHERE AS ONCE THE STORY I JUST

00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:38.812 region:rollup2
DESCRIBED EVERYONE IN THE IN THE

00:09:37.343 --> 00:09:40.647 region:rollup2
FACILITY WHERE EMPLOYEES OF THE

00:09:38.812 --> 00:09:41.648 region:rollup2
RETAILER. OF THAT'S NO LONGER

00:09:40.647 --> 00:09:42.949 region:rollup2
THE CASE.

00:09:41.648 --> 00:09:44.984 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE IN THE NINETEEN

00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:46.753 region:rollup2
NINETIES A MAJOR RETAILER

00:09:44.984 --> 00:09:47.754 region:rollup2
STARTED TO SAY WELL LET'S HAVE

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:49.656 region:rollup2
SOMEONE ELSE RUN THOSE

00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:50.990 region:rollup2
FACILITIES FOR US LET'S HIRE

00:09:49.656 --> 00:09:52.625 region:rollup2
COMPANIES LIKE SCHNEIDER

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:55.295 region:rollup2
LOGISTICS IS ONE OF THE MAJOR

00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:57.030 region:rollup2
GLOBAL PLAYERS IN THIS. AREA.

00:09:55.295 --> 00:09:59.232 region:rollup2
TO RUN IT BY OUR SPEX TO OUR

00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:00.934 region:rollup2
STANDARDS AND WILL BE PENALIZED

00:09:59.232 --> 00:10:02.435 region:rollup2
AND PAID BASED ON THEIR ABILITY

00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:04.404 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT BUT IT'S THEIR

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:06.039 region:rollup2
PROBLEM TO ACTUALLY RUN.

00:10:04.404 --> 00:10:07.507 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE THE PEOPLE PAY THE

00:10:06.039 --> 00:10:10.276 region:rollup2
PEOPLE AND SO ON.

00:10:07.507 --> 00:10:12.278 region:rollup2
THAT'S LEVEL ONE OF FEATURING

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:13.847 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S NOT WHERE IT STOPPED

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:15.482 region:rollup2
LEVEL TO A FEATURING HAS BEEN.

00:10:13.847 --> 00:10:17.217 region:rollup2
THAT WAS WORK FORCES ARE

00:10:15.482 --> 00:10:18.785 region:rollup2
INCREASINGLY NOT THE EMPLOYEES

00:10:17.217 --> 00:10:19.686 region:rollup2
OF THE THIRD PARTY LOGISTICS

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:22.055 region:rollup2
OPENING THE THIRD PARTY

00:10:19.686 --> 00:10:23.923 region:rollup2
LOGISTICS COMPANY GOES OUT AND

00:10:22.055 --> 00:10:25.558 region:rollup2
HIRES STAFFING AGENCY.

00:10:23.923 --> 00:10:27.360 region:rollup2
AND THOSE WORKERS ARE PAID BY

00:10:25.558 --> 00:10:29.028 region:rollup2
THE STAFFING AGENCY AND

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.264 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES HE IT THE FILTERING

00:10:29.028 --> 00:10:32.966 region:rollup2
GOES UN ONE FURTHER LEVEL WHERE

00:10:31.264 --> 00:10:33.800 region:rollup2
THE STAFFING AGENCY PAYS THOSE

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:35.335 region:rollup2
WORKERS AS IF THEY'RE

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.503 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AS IF

00:10:35.335 --> 00:10:37.770 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT EVEN THEIR EMPLOYEES

00:10:36.503 --> 00:10:39.806 region:rollup2
BUT THEY'RE BEING PAID ON A

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:41.407 region:rollup2
PIECE RATE BASIS. UMP THAT'S

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:43.743 region:rollup2
WHERE WHEN I WAS IN MY WAGE AN

00:10:41.407 --> 00:10:46.179 region:rollup2
HOUR HAD WE OFTEN FOUND FLAGRANT

00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:47.881 region:rollup2
VIOLATIONS OF NOT ONLY OVER TIME

00:10:46.179 --> 00:10:49.449 region:rollup2
IN JUST THE BASIC IDEA THAT YOU

00:10:47.881 --> 00:10:51.084 region:rollup2
SHOULD PAY PEOPLE FOR WORK. BUT

00:10:49.449 --> 00:10:52.285 region:rollup2
EVEN THE MINIMUM WAGE WOULD BE

00:10:51.084 --> 00:10:54.087 region:rollup2
VIOLATED IN THOSE SETTINGS.

00:10:52.285 --> 00:10:55.755 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S THE FEATURED

00:10:54.087 --> 00:10:57.824 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE WHERE YOU HAVE STILL

00:10:55.755 --> 00:10:59.993 region:rollup2
THE COMPANY THAT WE ALL KNOW

00:10:57.824 --> 00:11:01.461 region:rollup2
DICTATING ALL THE STANDARD SICKO

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:03.129 region:rollup2
WINE. BUT THE EMPLOYMENT

00:11:01.461 --> 00:11:04.397 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP BROKEN APART INTO

00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:06.299 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE PIECES.

00:11:04.397 --> 00:11:07.867 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THE STORY WOULD HAVE

00:11:06.299 --> 00:11:09.536 region:rollup2
TOLD YOU UP TILL ABOUT FIVE

00:11:07.867 --> 00:11:10.937 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO.

00:11:09.536 --> 00:11:12.305 region:rollup2
BUT THIS FEATURING STORY HAS

00:11:10.937 --> 00:11:14.207 region:rollup2
FEATURED FURTHER.

00:11:12.305 --> 00:11:15.708 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN JUST TO UNDERSCORE

00:11:14.207 --> 00:11:17.310 region:rollup2
AND SOMETHING THAT LINKS THE

00:11:15.708 --> 00:11:18.878 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION THAT I'M I'M PUTTING

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:20.747 region:rollup2
ON THE TABLE WITH WHAT YOU'RE

00:11:18.878 --> 00:11:22.182 region:rollup2
GOING TO HEAR MORE ABOUT.

00:11:20.747 --> 00:11:25.451 region:rollup2
IN IN OTHER SESSIONS.

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:27.921 region:rollup2
THE USE OF UBER TYPE PLATFORM

00:11:25.451 --> 00:11:28.888 region:rollup2
ECONOMIES TO CHANGE THIS EVEN

00:11:27.921 --> 00:11:30.823 region:rollup2
FURTHER.

00:11:28.888 --> 00:11:32.392 region:rollup2
AND WHAT I WOULD NOW JUST POINT

00:11:30.823 --> 00:11:35.161 region:rollup2
NOW IS THAT INSTEAD OF THE

00:11:32.392 --> 00:11:37.664 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS TRYING TO BRING GOODS TO

00:11:35.161 --> 00:11:39.832 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL STORES. IT'S NOW THE

00:11:37.664 --> 00:11:41.201 region:rollup2
GAME IS TO GET GOODS DIRECTLY

00:11:39.832 --> 00:11:42.435 region:rollup2
FOR HOME DELIVERY WHETHER THAT

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:44.971 region:rollup2
IS.

00:11:42.435 --> 00:11:47.473 region:rollup2
SOFT GOODS A KIND OF THINGS WE

00:11:44.971 --> 00:11:49.509 region:rollup2
BY WALMART OR GROCERIES.

00:11:47.473 --> 00:11:51.377 region:rollup2
AND ONCE AGAIN THAT IS BEING

00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:52.745 region:rollup2
DONE BY USING A NETWORK OF

00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:56.115 region:rollup2
BROKEN APART EMPLOYMENT

00:11:52.745 --> 00:11:57.383 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIPS SO WHAT RETAILERS

00:11:56.115 --> 00:11:59.485 region:rollup2
AND TYPICALLY COMPANIES LIKE

00:11:57.383 --> 00:12:01.187 region:rollup2
AMAZON ARE NOW DOING IS USING AN

00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:02.622 region:rollup2
INTERMEDIARY SET UP. WANT

SOMETIMES SINGLE CONTRACTOR

00:12:02.622 --> 00:12:08.294 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES MULTIPLE CONTRACTORS.

00:12:05.491 --> 00:12:09.996 region:rollup2
TO PICK UP THOSE GOODS.

00:12:08.294 --> 00:12:11.831 region:rollup2
AND THEN ROUTE THEM TO A NETWORK

00:12:09.996 --> 00:12:14.100 region:rollup2
OF CARS.

00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:15.501 region:rollup2
AND WHERE THE CARS ARE MUCH LIKE

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:17.804 region:rollup2
WE SEE IN PLATFORM

00:12:15.501 --> 00:12:19.439 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION ARE BEING OWNED

00:12:17.804 --> 00:12:21.207 region:rollup2
AND OPERATED BY INDIVIDUALS AS

00:12:19.439 --> 00:12:22.275 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS EVEN

00:12:21.207 --> 00:12:23.910 region:rollup2
THOUGH THOSE COULD BILL WAS

00:12:22.275 --> 00:12:25.678 region:rollup2
THERE THEIR MOVEMENT THERE IT

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:27.580 region:rollup2
COMPENSATION THEIR TIING THEIR

00:12:25.678 --> 00:12:29.649 region:rollup2
STANDARDS ARE ALL STILL DICTATED

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:31.985 region:rollup2
BY THE. BEAT THE RETAILER AND SO

00:12:29.649 --> 00:12:34.287 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU HAVE EVEN MORE SO IN

00:12:31.985 --> 00:12:34.854 region:rollup2
THIS MODERN SYSTEM OF RETAILING.

00:12:34.287 --> 00:12:36.923 region:rollup2
IS.

00:12:34.854 --> 00:12:37.757 region:rollup2
A MODELING OF WHO IS THE

00:12:36.923 --> 00:12:39.926 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER.

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:41.160 region:rollup2
THE MINUTE YOU CREATE I'M

00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:44.097 region:rollup2
TRAINED IN ECONOMICS AND YOU

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.965 region:rollup2
KNOW IT'S IT'S ALMOST AXIOMATIC

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:48.701 region:rollup2
THAT IF YOU BREAK APART. BUG OUT

00:12:45.965 --> 00:12:49.235 region:rollup2
A MARKET IN THE MULTIPLE PIECES

00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:49.602 region:rollup2
EVERYONE ASK TO GET THEIR

00:12:49.235 --> 00:12:51.304 region:rollup2
PROFIT.

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:52.905 region:rollup2
AND THAT MEANS WHAT'S LEFT AT

00:12:51.304 --> 00:12:54.941 region:rollup2
THE BOTTOM GET SMALLER AND

00:12:52.905 --> 00:12:56.042 region:rollup2
SMALLER AND IN PARTICULAR IF THE

00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:58.611 region:rollup2
ONLY THING YOU HAVE LEFT TO

00:12:56.042 --> 00:13:00.580 region:rollup2
CONTROL. ARE YOUR LABOR COSTS

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:01.981 region:rollup2
ARE UNFORTUNATELY IT'S WORKING

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.750 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO BEAR THE RISK OF

00:13:01.981 --> 00:13:05.618 region:rollup2
THESE THESE CHANGES. AND SO THE

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:07.453 region:rollup2
TRANSFORMATION THAT I I'VE JUST

00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:08.821 region:rollup2
OUTLINED TO YOU HAS RIPPLED

00:13:07.453 --> 00:13:10.456 region:rollup2
ACROSS OUR ECONOMY.

00:13:08.821 --> 00:13:11.691 region:rollup2
.

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:13.092 region:rollup2
I WON'T GO INTO THE DETAILS OF

00:13:11.691 --> 00:13:15.261 region:rollup2
THE SLIDE BUT I'LL JUST SIMPLY

00:13:13.092 --> 00:13:16.629 region:rollup2
TELL YOU. THAT A ONE OF THE TWO

00:13:15.261 --> 00:13:17.864 region:rollup2
OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED LABOR

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:20.166 region:rollup2
ECONOMISTS IN THIS FIELD HAVE

00:13:17.864 --> 00:13:21.200 region:rollup2
ESTIMATED. THAT NINETY FOUR

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:22.702 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.003 region:rollup2
NINETY FOUR PERCENT OF NET

00:13:22.702 --> 00:13:26.005 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT GROWTH IN THIS

00:13:24.003 --> 00:13:27.640 region:rollup2
ECONOMY FROM TWO THOUSAND FIVE

00:13:26.005 --> 00:13:28.941 region:rollup2
TO TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.777 region:rollup2
A ROSE FROM THESE KINDS OF

00:13:28.941 --> 00:13:32.512 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIPS

00:13:30.777 --> 00:13:35.481 region:rollup2
THAT VIRTUALLY ALL THE NET NEW

00:13:32.512 --> 00:13:37.283 region:rollup2
JOBS CREATED WERE IN THE FORM OF

00:13:35.481 --> 00:13:39.519 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTING ON CALL

00:13:37.283 --> 00:13:41.821 region:rollup2
WORKERS TEMPORARY HELP STAFFING

00:13:39.519 --> 00:13:44.357 region:rollup2
AGENCIES. OR WORKERS PROVIDED BY

00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:45.825 region:rollup2
SOME OTHER KIND OF CONTRACT FIRM

00:13:44.357 --> 00:13:47.627 region:rollup2
A THAT'S A LEVEL OF GROWTH OF IT

00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:50.129 region:rollup2
TYPE OF WORK PRACTICE WE HAVEN'T

00:13:47.627 --> 00:13:51.964 region:rollup2
SEEN THIS ECONOMY. I IN MY MIND

00:13:50.129 --> 00:13:53.166 region:rollup2
EVER AND IT'S IN THAT CONTEXT

00:13:51.964 --> 00:13:55.535 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE TO REALLY

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:56.502 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND AS I SAY THAT THE

00:13:55.535 --> 00:13:57.770 region:rollup2
FUTURE OF WORKERS HERE.

00:13:56.502 --> 00:13:59.639 region:rollup2
.

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:01.074 region:rollup2
THE LAST POINT BY I WOULD MAKE

00:13:59.639 --> 00:14:03.276 region:rollup2
IN CLOSING IS THAT.

00:14:01.074 --> 00:14:04.677 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING I'VE JUST DESCRIBED

00:14:03.276 --> 00:14:06.412 region:rollup2
TO YOU HAS BEEN MADE BY THE

00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:08.815 region:rollup2
CONSCIOUS CHOICES OF BUSINESSES

00:14:06.412 --> 00:14:10.683 region:rollup2
MAKING DECISIONS OFTEN BECAUSE

00:14:08.815 --> 00:14:11.517 region:rollup2
OF INTENSE PRESSURES THEY FACED

00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:12.652 region:rollup2
FROM CAPITAL MARKETS FROM

00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:13.553 region:rollup2
PRIVATE AND PUBLIC CAPITAL

00:14:12.652 --> 00:14:15.321 region:rollup2
MARKETS.

00:14:13.553 --> 00:14:17.023 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE FORCED COMPANIES

00:14:15.321 --> 00:14:18.891 region:rollup2
INCREASINGLY TO FOCUS ON CORE

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:20.526 region:rollup2
COMPETENCIES AND FIND WAYS TO

00:14:18.891 --> 00:14:22.195 region:rollup2
REDUCE OUR COSTS? THESE ARE

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:22.662 region:rollup2
CHOICES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:24.564 region:rollup2
THESE ARE CHOICES THAT

00:14:22.662 --> 00:14:26.699 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES.

00:14:24.564 --> 00:14:29.168 region:rollup2
CUT AGAINST THE GRAIN OF OUR

00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:31.637 region:rollup2
BASIC STRUCTURE OF STANDARDS.

00:14:29.168 --> 00:14:33.840 region:rollup2
AND AS A RESULT OF THAT.

00:14:31.637 --> 00:14:35.475 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT ONLY SHIFTED A LOT OF

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.310 region:rollup2
THE COSTS OF THESE PRACTICES ON

00:14:35.475 --> 00:14:38.711 region:rollup2
TO WORKING PEOPLE ARE BUT ALSO

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:39.779 region:rollup2
REQUIRE US TO RETHINK OUR WHOLE

00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:43.750 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO REGULATING THE LABOR

00:14:39.779 --> 00:14:44.550 region:rollup2
MARKET.

WE AT THE LABOR CENTER AND WITH

00:15:14.714 --> 00:15:17.283 region:rollup2
OUR ALLIES HAVE FIGURED OUT

00:15:15.948 --> 00:15:18.384 region:rollup2
AROUND WHETHER THE ROBOTS ARE

00:15:17.283 --> 00:15:20.219 region:rollup2
COMING IN WHETHER WE'RE GONNA

00:15:18.384 --> 00:15:21.154 region:rollup2
HAVE AN APOCALYPSE OR NOT. BUT I

00:15:20.219 --> 00:15:23.022 region:rollup2
JUST WANT TO SAY I REALLY

00:15:21.154 --> 00:15:24.791 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THE PAIRING ON THIS

00:15:23.022 --> 00:15:26.325 region:rollup2
PANEL OF THE TWO OF US. I THINK

00:15:24.791 --> 00:15:27.493 region:rollup2
IT'S VERYEASY AS YOU PROBABLY

00:15:26.325 --> 00:15:29.395 region:rollup2
KNOW WHEN YOU DIVE INTO THE NEW

00:15:27.493 --> 00:15:31.030 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY DEBATES TO GET TUNNEL

00:15:29.395 --> 00:15:32.432 region:rollup2
VISION AND TO THINK IT'S ALL

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:34.300 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE ABOUT TECHNOLOGY.

00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:35.635 region:rollup2
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE DAVID'S

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:38.438 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE THAT THERE IS A

00:15:35.635 --> 00:15:39.772 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF LONG TERM TRENDS HERE

00:15:38.438 --> 00:15:41.607 region:rollup2
IN THE LABOR MARKET AND

00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:43.109 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY WILL INCREASINGLY BE

00:15:41.607 --> 00:15:45.778 region:rollup2
PART OF THOSE TRENDS BUT IT'S

00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:48.314 region:rollup2
NOT THE ONLY ISSUE. THAT SAID IT

00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:50.383 region:rollup2
IS A BIG ISSUE AND.

00:15:48.314 --> 00:15:52.418 region:rollup2
I. I THINK WE ARE AT A

00:15:50.383 --> 00:15:54.387 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT POINT NOW THAN WE WERE

00:15:52.418 --> 00:15:55.488 region:rollup2
A YEAR AGO I THINK A YEAR AGO

00:15:54.387 --> 00:15:57.390 region:rollup2
AND THE RESEARCH AND POLICY

00:15:55.488 --> 00:15:59.625 region:rollup2
DEBATES WE WERE STILL VERY MUCH

00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:01.127 region:rollup2
IN THIS MODE OF. WE ARE GOING TO

00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:02.662 region:rollup2
HAVE MASSIVE JOB LOSS IN THE U.

00:16:01.127 --> 00:16:03.930 region:rollup2
S. YOU GUYS HAVE SEEN THE

00:16:02.662 --> 00:16:05.932 region:rollup2
STATISTICS YOU KNOW FORTY SEVEN

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:07.900 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF JOBS WILL BE LOST IN

00:16:05.932 --> 00:16:09.469 region:rollup2
THE U. S.. I THINK NOW WE ARE IN

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:11.037 region:rollup2
A DIFFERENT PLACE DUE IN PART TO

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:11.537 region:rollup2
REALLY GREAT RESEARCH BY

00:16:11.037 --> 00:16:14.574 region:rollup2
MCKINSEY.

00:16:11.537 --> 00:16:16.275 region:rollup2
AND I WILL JUST GIVE YOU A

00:16:14.574 --> 00:16:17.476 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF TOP LINES HERE I THINK

00:16:16.275 --> 00:16:19.712 region:rollup2
THAT CURRENT RESEARCH IS

00:16:17.476 --> 00:16:22.748 region:rollup2
SUGGESTING THAT WE ARE UNLIKELY

00:16:19.712 --> 00:16:24.350 region:rollup2
TO HAVE MASSIVE JOB DISPLACEMENT

00:16:22.748 --> 00:16:26.185 region:rollup2
IN THE NEAR AND MEDIUM TERM.

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:27.854 region:rollup2
WE CAN TALK MORE ABOUT THAT

00:16:26.185 --> 00:16:29.455 region:rollup2
STUDY DURING DISCUSSION.

00:16:27.854 --> 00:16:31.023 region:rollup2
BUT THEY DO ESTIMATED THAT THEY

00:16:29.455 --> 00:16:32.692 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE

00:16:31.023 --> 00:16:34.627 region:rollup2
THAT THE U. S. WILL HAVE ENOUGH

00:16:32.692 --> 00:16:38.231 region:rollup2
JOB GROWTH. AT LEAST AT TWENTY

00:16:34.627 --> 00:16:39.098 region:rollup2
THIRTY AND SO TO ME THE QUESTION

00:16:38.231 --> 00:16:40.299 region:rollup2
THEN BECOMES.

00:16:39.098 --> 00:16:42.268 region:rollup2
NOT THAT ONE IS NOT WORKING.

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:43.536 region:rollup2
.

00:16:42.268 --> 00:16:44.937 region:rollup2
WHAT IS GOING TO BE THE QUALITY

00:16:43.536 --> 00:16:46.439 region:rollup2
OF THE JOBS?

00:16:44.937 --> 00:16:48.007 region:rollup2
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND

00:16:46.439 --> 00:16:49.308 region:rollup2
HOWARD THESE CHANGES GOING TO

00:16:48.007 --> 00:16:51.077 region:rollup2
IMPACT VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES

00:16:49.308 --> 00:16:53.079 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IMMIGRANT

00:16:51.077 --> 00:16:55.481 region:rollup2
WORKERS WOMEN IT CETERA.

00:16:53.079 --> 00:16:55.915 region:rollup2
AND IF THAT'S THE QUESTION THEN

00:16:55.481 --> 00:16:57.450 region:rollup2
I THINK.

00:16:55.915 --> 00:16:58.551 region:rollup2
OUR PUBLIC POLICY HEARING

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:01.053 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE PRO

00:16:58.551 --> 00:17:02.488 region:rollup2
INNOVATION ABSOLUTELY BUT WE

00:17:01.053 --> 00:17:03.523 region:rollup2
HAVE TO PUT WORKERS AND IMPACTED

00:17:02.488 --> 00:17:06.058 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

00:17:03.523 --> 00:17:07.827 region:rollup2
AT THE CENTER OF THE DISCUSSION.

00:17:06.058 --> 00:17:08.661 region:rollup2
LET ME TO SHOW YOU A COUPLE MORE

00:17:07.827 --> 00:17:10.830 region:rollup2
SLIDES HERE.

00:17:08.661 --> 00:17:12.431 region:rollup2
.

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:13.499 region:rollup2
I'M JUST I'M TRYING TO TURN DOWN

00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:15.434 region:rollup2
PER YOUR SUGGESTION.

00:17:13.499 --> 00:17:16.569 region:rollup2
.

00:17:15.434 --> 00:17:18.237 region:rollup2
IF WE ARE NOT LOOKING OTHER

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:20.373 region:rollup2
ROBOTS APOCALYPSE THIS IS THE

00:17:18.237 --> 00:17:22.208 region:rollup2
GRAPH I THINK WE HAVE TO CARRY

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:24.043 region:rollup2
WITH US OVER AND OVER AND OVER

00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:25.111 region:rollup2
AGAIN SO THIS GRAPH SHOWS THE

00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:26.679 region:rollup2
GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY IN THE

00:17:25.111 --> 00:17:28.781 region:rollup2
U. S SINCE THE WORK POST WORLD

00:17:26.679 --> 00:17:30.349 region:rollup2
WAR TWO ERA. AND IT SHOWS THE

00:17:28.781 --> 00:17:32.084 region:rollup2
GROWTH IN HOURLY COMPENSATION IE

00:17:30.349 --> 00:17:33.753 region:rollup2
WAGES AND I'M SURE YOU GUYS HAVE

00:17:32.084 --> 00:17:35.955 region:rollup2
SEEN THIS GRAPH BEFORE STARTING

00:17:33.753 --> 00:17:37.990 region:rollup2
IN THE MID SEVENTIES THAT SOCIAL

00:17:35.955 --> 00:17:39.659 region:rollup2
CONTRACT BROKE APART. AND OUR

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:40.793 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVITY GAINS WERE NOT

00:17:39.659 --> 00:17:42.395 region:rollup2
SHARED WITH WORKERS.

00:17:40.793 --> 00:17:43.996 region:rollup2
AND THE REASON I FLAG THIS IS

00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:46.165 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AMONG ECONOMISTS AND A

00:17:43.996 --> 00:17:47.934 region:rollup2
LOT OF POLICYMAKERS THERE'S A

00:17:46.165 --> 00:17:49.235 region:rollup2
LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT ECONOMIC

00:17:47.934 --> 00:17:51.871 region:rollup2
GROWTH IN THE U. S. GOING

00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:53.439 region:rollup2
FORWARD. PEOPLE REALLY ARE I'M

00:17:51.871 --> 00:17:54.974 region:rollup2
ARE FOCUSED ON ARE WE GONNA HAVE

00:17:53.439 --> 00:17:56.342 region:rollup2
ENOUGH PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH AND

00:17:54.974 --> 00:17:57.944 region:rollup2
SO YOU WILL SEE ARGUMENTS AND

00:17:56.342 --> 00:18:00.079 region:rollup2
I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD THIS.

00:17:57.944 --> 00:18:01.514 region:rollup2
THAT WE SHOULD BE AYE INVESTING

00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:03.049 region:rollup2
EVEN MUCH MORE THAN WE ARE NOW

00:18:01.514 --> 00:18:05.318 region:rollup2
IN NEW TECHNOLOGY TO GET THE

00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:09.188 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH SO THAT OUR

00:18:05.318 --> 00:18:09.188 region:rollup2
ECONOMY CONTINUES TO GROW. AND

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:13.125 region:rollup2
BUT I WOULD SAY IS WE CANNOT

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:15.061 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT DEBATE WITHOUT ALSO

00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:15.895 region:rollup2
FOCUSING ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF

00:18:15.061 --> 00:18:17.630 region:rollup2
THE GAMES.

00:18:15.895 --> 00:18:18.497 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE I THINK THE DEFAULT

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:19.565 region:rollup2
WILL BE THERE'S A THERE'S

00:18:18.497 --> 00:18:21.033 region:rollup2
SEVERAL ECONOMISTS WHO ARE

00:18:19.565 --> 00:18:22.234 region:rollup2
ARGUING THAT NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL

00:18:21.033 --> 00:18:24.203 region:rollup2
JUST SERVE TO EXACERBATE

00:18:22.234 --> 00:18:26.138 region:rollup2
INEQUALITY. IF WE DON'T DO

00:18:24.203 --> 00:18:27.306 region:rollup2
ANYTHING ELSE SO JUST FOCUSING

00:18:26.138 --> 00:18:28.841 region:rollup2
ON PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH IN MY

00:18:27.306 --> 00:18:30.710 region:rollup2
MIND IS NOT ENOUGH AND I DON'T

00:18:28.841 --> 00:18:32.411 region:rollup2
THINK THIS IS AN EITHER OR LIKE

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:34.080 region:rollup2
YOU GUYS HAVE HAVE MENTIONED IN

00:18:32.411 --> 00:18:35.781 region:rollup2
YOUR OPENING REMARKS. I THINK

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.582 region:rollup2
THERE IS A WAY WE CAN HAVE

00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:38.384 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH NEW

00:18:36.582 --> 00:18:38.884 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY AND.

00:18:38.384 --> 00:18:40.419 region:rollup2
SHARE IT WITH WORKERS.

00:18:38.884 --> 00:18:41.520 region:rollup2
.

00:18:40.419 --> 00:18:43.556 region:rollup2
HERE IS.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.524 region:rollup2
.

00:18:43.556 --> 00:18:47.059 region:rollup2
A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES I HAVE OF.

00:18:45.524 --> 00:18:49.395 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF

00:18:47.059 --> 00:18:50.563 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES WE

00:18:49.395 --> 00:18:51.897 region:rollup2
HAVE AND I'M NOT GOING TO GO TO

00:18:50.563 --> 00:18:53.499 region:rollup2
ALL OF THEM BUT I WILL FLAG AND

00:18:51.897 --> 00:18:54.667 region:rollup2
THIS IS COMING FROM NEW RESEARCH

00:18:53.499 --> 00:18:55.701 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE COMMISSIONING WE

00:18:54.667 --> 00:18:57.303 region:rollup2
HAVE COMMISSIONED A SERIES OF

00:18:55.701 --> 00:18:58.104 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY STUDIES AROUND THE

00:18:57.303 --> 00:18:59.639 region:rollup2
LIKELY IMPACTS OF NEW

00:18:58.104 --> 00:19:01.741 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES.

00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:03.242 region:rollup2
IN YOU ALL HAVE HEARD A LOT

00:19:01.741 --> 00:19:05.277 region:rollup2
ABOUT LONG HAUL TRUCKING IN THE

00:19:03.242 --> 00:19:06.746 region:rollup2
COMING ABOUT TIME LIMITS TRUCKS

00:19:05.277 --> 00:19:09.115 region:rollup2
AND HOW WOULD THEY LIKE LEAD TO

00:19:06.746 --> 00:19:10.983 region:rollup2
DISPLACE THREE MILLION LONG HAUL

00:19:09.115 --> 00:19:12.351 region:rollup2
TRUCKERS THESE ARE THE GUYS WHO

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:15.121 region:rollup2
MOVE STUFF ON THE HIGHWAYS.

00:19:12.351 --> 00:19:17.390 region:rollup2
OUR RESEARCH IS SUGGESTING THAT

00:19:15.121 --> 00:19:19.191 region:rollup2
WE WILL ACTUALLY THOUGH ALSO SEE

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:20.826 region:rollup2
A GROWTH IN TRUCKING JOBS IN

00:19:19.191 --> 00:19:22.028 region:rollup2
SHORT HAUL TRUCKING AND

00:19:20.826 --> 00:19:23.963 region:rollup2
PRECISELY BECAUSE OF THE

00:19:22.028 --> 00:19:25.831 region:rollup2
GOODNESS OF TO ONLINE RETAIL IN

00:19:23.963 --> 00:19:27.099 region:rollup2
THE GROWTH OF WAREHOUSES.

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:29.368 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO NEED A LOT MORE.

00:19:27.099 --> 00:19:30.436 region:rollup2
FOLKS MOVING STUFF BETWEEN

00:19:29.368 --> 00:19:32.638 region:rollup2
WAREHOUSES AND FULFILLMENT

00:19:30.436 --> 00:19:34.240 region:rollup2
CENTERS AND THEN TO CONSUMERS

00:19:32.638 --> 00:19:35.741 region:rollup2
AND THE KEY QUESTION IS WHAT IS

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:37.677 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE THE QUALITY OF THOSE

00:19:35.741 --> 00:19:39.245 region:rollup2
JOBS. THAT SHORT HAUL TRUCKING

00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:40.746 region:rollup2
JOB IS NOW IN THE TOP TEN LIST

00:19:39.245 --> 00:19:42.982 region:rollup2
ON MONSTER DOT COM IN TERMS OF

00:19:40.746 --> 00:19:45.284 region:rollup2
JOB OPENINGS BUT YOU CAN.

00:19:42.982 --> 00:19:47.586 region:rollup2
IMAGINE THAT ONE OF THE DEFAULT

00:19:45.284 --> 00:19:48.387 region:rollup2
SCENARIOS WILL BE THAT THESE

00:19:47.586 --> 00:19:49.655 region:rollup2
WILL BE GIG JOBS.

00:19:48.387 --> 00:19:51.724 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WILL BE INDEPENDENT

00:19:49.655 --> 00:19:53.826 region:rollup2
CONTRACTORS AND THEY WILL PICK

00:19:51.724 --> 00:19:55.828 region:rollup2
UP SHORT PACKAGE DELIVERY IN

00:19:53.826 --> 00:19:57.430 region:rollup2
MOVEMENT BETWEEN WAREHOUSES BUT

00:19:55.828 --> 00:19:58.764 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT INEVITABLE.

00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:00.099 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THE QUESTION FOR US

00:19:58.764 --> 00:20:00.733 region:rollup2
IS POLICYMAKERS IN THOSE

00:20:00.099 --> 00:20:03.903 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

00:20:00.733 --> 00:20:05.538 region:rollup2
IS WHAT ARE WE GOING TO ASK OF

00:20:03.903 --> 00:20:07.206 region:rollup2
THE WAREHOUSES WHEN THEY COME

00:20:05.538 --> 00:20:09.542 region:rollup2
INTO OUR COMMUNITIES.

00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:11.377 region:rollup2
CAN WE IMAGINE THE THE

00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:13.012 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT THAT THE NEW

00:20:11.377 --> 00:20:14.547 region:rollup2
TRUCKING JOBS WILL ACTUALLY BE

00:20:13.012 --> 00:20:16.649 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES AND THAT THEY WILL BE

00:20:14.547 --> 00:20:18.818 region:rollup2
AND HOUSE JOBS RIGHT AND WE CAN

00:20:16.649 --> 00:20:19.552 region:rollup2
MAKE THAT DECISION WE CAN MAKE

00:20:18.818 --> 00:20:21.287 region:rollup2
THAT FUTURE.

00:20:19.552 --> 00:20:23.222 region:rollup2
ON THE OTHER END OF THE

00:20:21.287 --> 00:20:24.290 region:rollup2
SPECTRUM SORT OF MORE IN TERMS

00:20:23.222 --> 00:20:26.025 region:rollup2
OF OPPORTUNITIES.

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:27.593 region:rollup2
I'M HOPEFUL STORIES IN THE

00:20:26.025 --> 00:20:29.428 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SECTOR THERE IS AN

00:20:27.593 --> 00:20:30.329 region:rollup2
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF TECHNOLOGICAL

00:20:29.428 --> 00:20:32.565 region:rollup2
CHANGE THAT.

00:20:30.329 --> 00:20:34.266 region:rollup2
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME AND HAS

00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:36.268 region:rollup2
BEEN HAPPENING FOR AWHILE.

00:20:34.266 --> 00:20:37.536 region:rollup2
AND IN CALIFORNIA WE ACTUALLY

00:20:36.268 --> 00:20:39.338 region:rollup2
HAVE A REALLY INTERESTING

00:20:37.536 --> 00:20:40.873 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THAT WE ARE TRYING TO

00:20:39.338 --> 00:20:42.742 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND BETTER WITH KAISER.

00:20:40.873 --> 00:20:44.076 region:rollup2
AND SO AS YOU KNOW KAISER IS ONE

00:20:42.742 --> 00:20:45.511 region:rollup2
OF THE BIGGEST HEALTH CARE

00:20:44.076 --> 00:20:47.012 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS AND IN THE COUNTRY.

00:20:45.511 --> 00:20:48.881 region:rollup2
AND HAS A LABOR MANAGEMENT

00:20:47.012 --> 00:20:50.816 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP AND THAT LABOR

00:20:48.881 --> 00:20:53.385 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT PARTNERSHIP DOES A

00:20:50.816 --> 00:20:55.654 region:rollup2
LOT OF DELIBERATIONS BETWEEN

00:20:53.385 --> 00:20:57.256 region:rollup2
KAISER AND ITS UNIONS ABOUT HOW

00:20:55.654 --> 00:20:58.858 region:rollup2
NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE GOING TO

00:20:57.256 --> 00:21:00.426 region:rollup2
IMPACT WORKERS IN THE WORKPLACE.

00:20:58.858 --> 00:21:01.761 region:rollup2
AND IN FACT MY UNDERSTANDING IS

00:21:00.426 --> 00:21:03.162 region:rollup2
KAISER.

00:21:01.761 --> 00:21:04.497 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY IMPLEMENTED

00:21:03.162 --> 00:21:05.965 region:rollup2
ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS THEY

00:21:04.497 --> 00:21:07.700 region:rollup2
WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THEIR

00:21:05.965 --> 00:21:08.801 region:rollup2
WORKERS IN WITH THEIR UNIONS AND

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:10.870 region:rollup2
IT IS WIDELY CONSIDERED ONE OF

00:21:08.801 --> 00:21:12.037 region:rollup2
THE BEST EXAMPLES OF ELECTRONIC

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:12.972 region:rollup2
HEALTH RECORDS.

00:21:12.037 --> 00:21:14.507 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S A LOT OF BAD

00:21:12.972 --> 00:21:16.775 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES AS YOU GUYS PROBABLY

00:21:14.507 --> 00:21:18.744 region:rollup2
KNOW SO IN MY MIND THAT IS THE

00:21:16.775 --> 00:21:19.612 region:rollup2
VISION THAT WE WANT AND I THINK

00:21:18.744 --> 00:21:21.347 region:rollup2
IN IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:22.414 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES THAT WE CAN DRAW ON.

00:21:21.347 --> 00:21:24.850 region:rollup2
WHERE WORKERS ARE ACTUALLY

00:21:22.414 --> 00:21:27.620 region:rollup2
ENGAGED IN THE PROCESS ITSELF OF

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:28.754 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES?

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.422 region:rollup2
AND SO I LEAVE YOU WOULD.

00:21:28.754 --> 00:21:31.490 region:rollup2
.

00:21:30.422 --> 00:21:31.924 region:rollup2
I AM NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:34.093 region:rollup2
THIS.

00:21:31.924 --> 00:21:36.262 region:rollup2
THIS IS OUR GRADE THAT WE ARE

00:21:34.093 --> 00:21:38.197 region:rollup2
USING RIGHT NOW TO IDENTIFY

00:21:36.262 --> 00:21:40.666 region:rollup2
AREAS WHERE WE NEED PUBLIC

00:21:38.197 --> 00:21:42.434 region:rollup2
POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND WE CAN GO

00:21:40.666 --> 00:21:43.769 region:rollup2
BACK TO THIS IF WE WANT. I'D I

00:21:42.434 --> 00:21:45.271 region:rollup2
THINK YOU ALL KNOW WE HAVE VERY

00:21:43.769 --> 00:21:46.772 region:rollup2
LITTLE RIGHT NOW THAT FOLKS HAVE

00:21:45.271 --> 00:21:48.440 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED IN TERMS OF POLICY

00:21:46.772 --> 00:21:51.076 region:rollup2
RESPONSES WHEN IT COMES TO

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:52.945 region:rollup2
DISPLACEMENT OR OR EDUCATION AND

00:21:51.076 --> 00:21:55.381 region:rollup2
TRAINING AT CETERA.

00:21:52.945 --> 00:21:57.416 region:rollup2
I THINK MY CONCERN IS THAT WE DO

00:21:55.381 --> 00:21:59.485 region:rollup2
POLICY MAKING IN THIS AREA ON AN

00:21:57.416 --> 00:22:01.987 region:rollup2
AD HOC BASIS.

00:21:59.485 --> 00:22:03.789 region:rollup2
OR IN SORT OF WHACK A MOLE FORM

00:22:01.987 --> 00:22:05.958 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK WE HAVE SOME ON

00:22:03.789 --> 00:22:08.227 region:rollup2
RAMP TIME HERE RIGHT THIS IS NOT

00:22:05.958 --> 00:22:09.929 region:rollup2
ALL HAPPENING TOMORROW. LET US

00:22:08.227 --> 00:22:11.096 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE VISION

00:22:09.929 --> 00:22:13.265 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE A WHAT WE WANT

00:22:11.096 --> 00:22:15.467 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY TO DO AND LET'S ASK

00:22:13.265 --> 00:22:16.769 region:rollup2
BIG QUESTIONS THAT WILL PROVIDE

00:22:15.467 --> 00:22:19.205 region:rollup2
A FRAMEWORK FOR PUBLIC POLICY

00:22:16.769 --> 00:22:20.773 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO

00:22:19.205 --> 00:22:22.374 region:rollup2
HERE ARE SOME BIG QUESTIONS.

00:22:20.773 --> 00:22:25.010 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD IT TWENTY FIRST

00:22:22.374 --> 00:22:26.812 region:rollup2
CENTURY EDUCATION TRAINING AND

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:28.414 region:rollup2
SAFETY NET SYSTEM LOOK LIKE?

00:22:26.812 --> 00:22:30.616 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE ENSURE OUR ECONOMY

00:22:28.414 --> 00:22:32.585 region:rollup2
GROWS GOOD JOBS AND IN MY MIND

00:22:30.616 --> 00:22:35.754 region:rollup2
WHERE WORKERS WORK ALONGSIDE AND

00:22:32.585 --> 00:22:35.754 region:rollup2
WOOD TECHNOLOGY?

00:22:35.821 --> 00:22:41.427 region:rollup2
REDUCE ECONOMIC INEQUALITY AND

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:42.661 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY RACE AND GENDER BIAS?

00:22:41.427 --> 00:22:44.063 region:rollup2
AND THEN PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANT

00:22:42.661 --> 00:22:45.497 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF

00:22:44.063 --> 00:22:47.466 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS IN ANSWERING THESE

00:22:45.497 --> 00:22:49.568 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS AND IN PARTICULAR THE

00:22:47.466 --> 00:22:50.936 region:rollup2
TECH SECTOR. THERE ARE MANY MORE

00:22:49.568 --> 00:22:52.004 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS LIKE THIS BUT I THINK

00:22:50.936 --> 00:22:53.038 region:rollup2
THE USE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT

00:22:52.004 --> 00:22:55.407 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE THE STARTING PLACE

00:22:53.038 --> 00:22:57.910 region:rollup2
BEFORE WE DIVE INTO SORT OF THE

00:22:55.407 --> 00:22:59.211 region:rollup2
MY MUSHA. OF SPECIFIC PIECES OF

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:00.379 region:rollup2
PUBLIC POLICY.

00:22:59.211 --> 00:23:02.915 region:rollup2
THANK YOU SO MUCH I LOOK FORWARD

00:23:00.379 --> 00:23:03.849 region:rollup2
TO OUR DISCUSSION.

00:23:02.915 --> 00:23:05.651 region:rollup2
THANK YOU THANK YOU BOTH FOR

SUGGESTS.

00:24:03.943 --> 00:24:08.314 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PHENOMENA.

00:24:05.678 --> 00:24:09.381 region:rollup2
I IN I HAVE TO SAY THIS IS A

00:24:08.314 --> 00:24:10.482 region:rollup2
SPACE THAT I NEVER THOUGHT WOULD

00:24:09.381 --> 00:24:12.618 region:rollup2
OCCUR.

00:24:10.482 --> 00:24:14.987 region:rollup2
WHEN I HEARD PEOPLE TALKING

00:24:12.618 --> 00:24:16.422 region:rollup2
ABOUT. THE YOU KNOW AUTOMATION I

00:24:14.987 --> 00:24:18.023 region:rollup2
THOUGHT ABOUT CARTOONS I WATCHED

00:24:16.422 --> 00:24:19.958 region:rollup2
AS A KID WHERE THEY WERE ROBOTS

00:24:18.023 --> 00:24:20.693 region:rollup2
DOING THINGS FOR PEOPLE AND THEN

00:24:19.958 --> 00:24:21.493 region:rollup2
THE NEXT THING I HEARD THAT

00:24:20.693 --> 00:24:23.329 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GONNA BE EIGHTEEN

00:24:21.493 --> 00:24:26.065 region:rollup2
WHEELERS THAT WERE SOFT DRIVING.

00:24:23.329 --> 00:24:27.933 region:rollup2
TRUCKS DOING LONG HALLS AND SO

00:24:26.065 --> 00:24:29.668 region:rollup2
CLEARLY THE TECHNOLOGY IS HERE

00:24:27.933 --> 00:24:31.337 region:rollup2
HAS ARRIVED OF FROM YOUR

00:24:29.668 --> 00:24:32.204 region:rollup2
STANDPOINT HOW WHAT CONVERSATION

00:24:31.337 --> 00:24:34.940 region:rollup2
SHOULD WE BE HAVING GOING

00:24:32.204 --> 00:24:38.143 region:rollup2
FORWARD. AS A LABOR COMMUNITY

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:39.345 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY A COMPANY'S BUSINESS

00:24:38.143 --> 00:24:40.112 region:rollup2
TOGETHER OF MOVING FOR.

00:24:39.345 --> 00:24:41.246 region:rollup2
NOW I THINK THAT'S A GREAT

00:24:40.112 --> 00:24:42.848 region:rollup2
QUESTION AND I JUST WANNA MAKE

00:24:41.246 --> 00:24:44.650 region:rollup2
REALLY SURE I AM NOT PAINTING A

00:24:42.848 --> 00:24:45.284 region:rollup2
ROSY PICTURE HERE.

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:46.986 region:rollup2
SO.

00:24:45.284 --> 00:24:48.053 region:rollup2
JUST BECAUSE I'M SAYING

00:24:46.986 --> 00:24:49.788 region:rollup2
RESURGENT RIGHT NOW IS

00:24:48.053 --> 00:24:52.091 region:rollup2
SUGGESTING WE ARE NOT GONNA HAVE

00:24:49.788 --> 00:24:53.225 region:rollup2
AN IMMINENT ROBOTS APOCALYPSE WE

00:24:52.091 --> 00:24:54.760 region:rollup2
KNOW THERE'S GOING TO BE

00:24:53.225 --> 00:24:56.829 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT DISPLACEMENT OF

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.564 region:rollup2
WORKERS. WE WILL NEED TO RETRAIN

00:24:56.829 --> 00:24:59.898 region:rollup2
WORKERS ON THE JOB WE WILL WE

00:24:58.564 --> 00:25:01.734 region:rollup2
WILL NEED TO FIND NEW JOBS FOR

00:24:59.898 --> 00:25:03.902 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO TOTALLY LOSE OUR JOBS

00:25:01.734 --> 00:25:05.738 region:rollup2
ALTOGETHER THERE IS A REAL.

00:25:03.902 --> 00:25:07.339 region:rollup2
POLICY CHALLENGE HERE AND WE CAN

00:25:05.738 --> 00:25:09.408 region:rollup2
NAVIGATE WE CAN GO THROUGH THIS.

00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:11.744 region:rollup2
NEXT TRANSITION.

00:25:09.408 --> 00:25:12.745 region:rollup2
IN A PAINFUL WAY OR WE CAN DO

00:25:11.744 --> 00:25:13.946 region:rollup2
IN WAYS THAT TAKE CARE OF

00:25:12.745 --> 00:25:16.014 region:rollup2
WORKERS SIDE I DON'T PAINT TOO

00:25:13.946 --> 00:25:17.649 region:rollup2
ROSY A PICTURE. I THINK THERE'S

00:25:16.014 --> 00:25:20.352 region:rollup2
TWO PIECES HERE ONE IS.

00:25:17.649 --> 00:25:21.653 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO BE INVESTING AND WE

00:25:20.352 --> 00:25:22.988 region:rollup2
CAN PARTNER WE SHOULD BE

00:25:21.653 --> 00:25:24.590 region:rollup2
PARTNERING WITH YOU WHILE WE

00:25:22.988 --> 00:25:26.458 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE INVESTING AND THE

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:28.293 region:rollup2
TYPE OF. REALLY CONCRETE

00:25:26.458 --> 00:25:30.829 region:rollup2
RESEARCH INTO PARTICULAR

00:25:28.293 --> 00:25:32.097 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIES TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS

00:25:30.829 --> 00:25:34.366 region:rollup2
COMING DOWN THE PIPELINE IN THE

00:25:32.097 --> 00:25:35.934 region:rollup2
NEAR AND MEDIUM TERM I THINK WE

00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:37.436 region:rollup2
HAVE REACHED DOES SORT OF THE.

00:25:35.934 --> 00:25:39.238 region:rollup2
LIMITS OF WHAT THE SORT OF

00:25:37.436 --> 00:25:40.939 region:rollup2
MACKENZIE TYPE STUDIES CAN TEACH

00:25:39.238 --> 00:25:42.908 region:rollup2
US THEIR VERY AGGREGATE VERY

00:25:40.939 --> 00:25:44.543 region:rollup2
HIGH LEVEL. I THINK IN ORDER FOR

00:25:42.908 --> 00:25:46.578 region:rollup2
YOU ALL TO ACT AND IN ORDER FOR

00:25:44.543 --> 00:25:48.113 region:rollup2
UNIONS TO ACT WE NEED TO KNOW

00:25:46.578 --> 00:25:49.415 region:rollup2
LIKE IN THE GROCERY STORE

00:25:48.113 --> 00:25:51.350 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY WHAT ARE THE THREE

00:25:49.415 --> 00:25:53.152 region:rollup2
TRENDS WEARS JOB GROWTH LIKELY

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:55.254 region:rollup2
TO BE. WHERE WE GONNA LOSE IT

00:25:53.152 --> 00:25:56.889 region:rollup2
WHERE ARE OUR LEVERAGE POINTS

00:25:55.254 --> 00:25:57.890 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND SO THAT IS WHY WE HAVE

00:25:56.889 --> 00:25:59.291 region:rollup2
INVESTED IN THAT TYPE OF

00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:01.627 region:rollup2
RESEARCH AND THIS IS GOING TO BE

00:25:59.291 --> 00:26:03.162 region:rollup2
AN ON GOING? BY NEED FOR MORE

00:26:01.627 --> 00:26:05.464 region:rollup2
AND MORE INFORMATION FROM THE

00:26:03.162 --> 00:26:06.064 region:rollup2
FIELD. AND THEN I WOULD SAY

00:26:05.464 --> 00:26:08.834 region:rollup2
SECOND.

00:26:06.064 --> 00:26:10.869 region:rollup2
WE HAD A VERY INTERESTING A

00:26:08.834 --> 00:26:12.204 region:rollup2
VISIT FROM A DELEGATION FROM

00:26:10.869 --> 00:26:14.840 region:rollup2
DENMARK.

00:26:12.204 --> 00:26:16.642 region:rollup2
TWO WEEKS AGO AND I WILL SHARE

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:18.277 region:rollup2
WITH YOU THAT IN EUROPE EVERY

00:26:16.642 --> 00:26:21.547 region:rollup2

DISCUSSION ABOUT THE FUTURE OF

00:26:30.522 --> 00:26:34.793 region:rollup2
WORK. FOR TO FIND AREAS OF

00:26:32.524 --> 00:26:37.729 region:rollup2
COMMON INTEREST AND TO BEGIN TO

PUT UP PLAN ACTUAL PROGRAMMING.

00:26:37.729 --> 00:26:41.333 region:rollup2
AND IT IS AMAZING TO ME THAT

00:26:40.032 --> 00:26:43.101 region:rollup2
THE U. S. DOES NOT HAVE A

00:26:41.333 --> 00:26:44.536 region:rollup2
PROCESS LIKE THAT I THINK THAT

00:26:43.101 --> 00:26:47.806 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO HAVE TO HAPPEN AT

00:26:44.536 --> 00:26:48.307 region:rollup2
THE STATE LEVEL FRANKLY.

00:26:47.806 --> 00:26:49.007 region:rollup2

RIBBON COMMISSION BUT AS YOU

00:26:50.242 --> 00:26:51.810 region:rollup2

THE BLUEPRINTS OF WHAT

00:26:57.116 --> 00:27:00.819 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES LIKE DENMARK AND

00:26:58.383 --> 00:27:02.688 region:rollup2

IT'S A CHOICE IT'S HOW WE

00:28:09.321 --> 00:28:13.625 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE JOBS IN THE FUTURE.

THE QUESTION YOU JUST ASKED ME.

00:28:33.245 --> 00:28:38.450 region:rollup2
THERE IS ALWAYS THIS TEMPTATION.

00:28:36.114 --> 00:28:41.486 region:rollup2
AMONG BOTH ECONOMISTS.

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:43.655 region:rollup2
AND TECHNOLOGY PEOPLE TO TALK

00:28:41.486 --> 00:28:45.857 region:rollup2
ABOUT THESE CHANGES AS IF THEY

00:28:43.655 --> 00:28:47.960 region:rollup2
ARE FORCES OF NATURE THAT THEY

00:28:45.857 --> 00:28:50.162 region:rollup2

00:28:51.697 --> 00:28:57.536 region:rollup2
MARKETS MOVE IN CERTAIN WAYS

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:58.737 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF ECONOMIC FORCES BUT

00:28:57.536 --> 00:29:00.372 region:rollup2
THEY ARE STEERED BY SOCIAL

00:28:58.737 --> 00:29:02.007 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS ARE STEERED BY

00:29:00.372 --> 00:29:03.442 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT POLICIES ARE STEERED

00:29:02.007 --> 00:29:05.210 region:rollup2
BY WHO SITTING AT THE TABLE WHEN

00:29:03.442 --> 00:29:06.478 region:rollup2
THOSE CHOICES ARE MADE.

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:08.547 region:rollup2
AND SO.

00:29:06.478 --> 00:29:09.982 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT ANNETTA GAVE A GREAT

00:29:08.547 --> 00:29:12.818 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THAT BUILDS ON THE

00:29:09.982 --> 00:29:14.486 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE I PUT ON A UP ON.

00:29:12.818 --> 00:29:17.222 region:rollup2
ON THE CHART.

00:29:14.486 --> 00:29:19.391 region:rollup2
THERE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE

00:29:17.222 --> 00:29:20.726 region:rollup2
CHANGES THAT WILL ARISE FROM THE

00:29:19.391 --> 00:29:21.994 region:rollup2
AUTOMATION OF TRANSPORTATION

00:29:20.726 --> 00:29:24.429 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS.

00:29:21.994 --> 00:29:25.330 region:rollup2
BUT THERE IS THE SECONDARY

00:29:24.429 --> 00:29:27.232 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WE'RE STILL GOING TO

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:28.700 region:rollup2
HAVE TO GET PACKAGES TO PEOPLE'S

00:29:27.232 --> 00:29:30.869 region:rollup2
DOORS WERE PROBABLY GOING TO BE

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:32.604 region:rollup2
RELYING ON HUMAN BEINGS FOR THAT

00:29:30.869 --> 00:29:35.007 region:rollup2
FOR QUITE SOMETIME.

00:29:32.604 --> 00:29:37.109 region:rollup2
HOW THOSE JOBS ARE DESIGNED?

00:29:35.007 --> 00:29:38.777 region:rollup2
IS VERY MUCH GOING TO BE A

00:29:37.109 --> 00:29:40.512 region:rollup2
FUNCTION OF HOW WE THINK ABOUT

00:29:38.777 --> 00:29:42.381 region:rollup2
WHO WE HAVE AT THE TABLE WHAT WE

00:29:40.512 --> 00:29:44.149 region:rollup2
HAVE IN TERMS OF EXPECTATIONS OF

00:29:42.381 --> 00:29:45.550 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS ABOUT HOW THEY ARE

00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:47.686 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE TREATING THAT

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:50.222 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE. ITEM AND THAT WILL

00:29:47.686 --> 00:29:51.923 region:rollup2
THEN RIPPLE OUT TO HOW MUCH OF

00:29:50.222 --> 00:29:53.558 region:rollup2
THE ENORMOUS GAINS SAID ARE

00:29:51.923 --> 00:29:55.093 region:rollup2
BEING ENJOYED BY SOME OF OUR

00:29:53.558 --> 00:29:56.828 region:rollup2
HIGH TECH COMPANIES WILL BE

00:29:55.093 --> 00:29:58.363 region:rollup2
SHARED BY THEIR LABOR FORCE HOW

00:29:56.828 --> 00:29:58.930 region:rollup2
MUCH WILL BE SHARED BY THE

00:29:58.363 --> 00:30:02.034 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:03.802 region:rollup2
OPERATE. HOW MUCH OF THE RISK?

00:30:02.034 --> 00:30:06.238 region:rollup2
THE RISK THAT WORKING PEOPLE

00:30:03.802 --> 00:30:07.806 region:rollup2
FACE THAT HISTORICALLY WE ASK

00:30:06.238 --> 00:30:09.808 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS TO HELP THEM WITH THAT

00:30:07.806 --> 00:30:11.243 region:rollup2
RISK AND WE HAD PUBLIC POLICIES

00:30:09.808 --> 00:30:12.844 region:rollup2
LIKE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND

00:30:11.243 --> 00:30:14.546 region:rollup2
WORKERS COMPENSATION.

00:30:12.844 --> 00:30:16.114 region:rollup2
TO CUSHION THOSE RISKS HOW MUCH

00:30:14.546 --> 00:30:18.583 region:rollup2
OF THOSE RISK WILL BE SHIFTED

00:30:16.114 --> 00:30:20.319 region:rollup2
ONTO WORKING PEOPLE RIGHT NOW WE

00:30:18.583 --> 00:30:21.853 region:rollup2
ARE UNFORTUNATELY DRIFTING INTO

00:30:20.319 --> 00:30:22.954 region:rollup2
A SYSTEM.

00:30:21.853 --> 00:30:24.890 region:rollup2
WHERE THE IMPACTS OF SOME OF THE

00:30:22.954 --> 00:30:25.090 region:rollup2
AUTOMATION CHANGES HERE ASKING

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:26.858 region:rollup2
ABOUT?

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:27.959 region:rollup2
?

00:30:26.858 --> 00:30:30.796 region:rollup2
AND THE DOCTOR BERNHARDT

00:30:27.959 --> 00:30:32.898 region:rollup2
DESCRIBED ARE GOING TO RESULT IN

00:30:30.796 --> 00:30:34.866 region:rollup2
TWO RISKS BORN BY WORKING PEOPLE

00:30:32.898 --> 00:30:36.635 region:rollup2
AND HAVING A. WORSE AND WORSE

00:30:34.866 --> 00:30:38.637 region:rollup2
SOCIAL SAFETY NET AND GAINING

00:30:36.635 --> 00:30:40.739 region:rollup2
LESS AND LESS OF THE VALUE THEIR

00:30:38.637 --> 00:30:42.674 region:rollup2
CREATING IN THE FORM OF WAGES.

00:30:40.739 --> 00:30:44.476 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN I GO BACK TO THE

00:30:42.674 --> 00:30:47.079 region:rollup2
PREMISE WHICH IS THAT SOCIAL

00:30:44.476 --> 00:30:49.214 region:rollup2
CHOICE RIGHT NOW THAT'S BECAUSE

00:30:47.079 --> 00:30:50.515 region:rollup2
WE HAVE LEFT OPEN CERTAIN SOCIAL

00:30:49.214 --> 00:30:52.150 region:rollup2
POLICIES ABOUT WHO IS AN

00:30:50.515 --> 00:30:54.586 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE WHO IS AN INDEPENDENT

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:57.956 region:rollup2
CONTRACTOR. REALLY TO BE DECIDED

00:30:54.586 --> 00:30:59.324 region:rollup2
BY. A EMPLOYERS AND DECIDED IN

00:30:57.956 --> 00:31:01.059 region:rollup2
THE BREACH RATHER THAN HAVING.

00:30:59.324 --> 00:31:02.594 region:rollup2
PURPOSIVE PUBLIC POLICIES THAT

00:31:01.059 --> 00:31:04.696 region:rollup2
REALLY MAKE IT CLEAR WHAT

00:31:02.594 --> 00:31:06.465 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS WE WANNA HAVE OF

00:31:04.696 --> 00:31:08.133 region:rollup2
WORKING PEOPLE TO LIVE IN AND

00:31:06.465 --> 00:31:08.700 region:rollup2
THEN LETTING BUSINESSES MAKE

00:31:08.133 --> 00:31:10.168 region:rollup2
DECISIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:11.403 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:31:10.168 --> 00:31:12.771 region:rollup2
AM I GUESS YOU KNOW I'VE TAUGHT

00:31:11.403 --> 00:31:13.839 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS OF BUSINESS SCHOOL

00:31:12.771 --> 00:31:16.108 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

00:31:13.839 --> 00:31:17.843 region:rollup2
BUSINESS SCHOOL STUDENTS AND

00:31:16.108 --> 00:31:18.377 region:rollup2
PEOPLE IN THEM IN IN IN THE IN

00:31:17.843 --> 00:31:19.211 region:rollup2
THE PRIVATE SECTOR PRETTY

00:31:18.377 --> 00:31:20.879 region:rollup2
CLEVER.

00:31:19.211 --> 00:31:23.615 region:rollup2
THEY'LL FIGURE OUT WAYS TO MAKE

00:31:20.879 --> 00:31:25.217 region:rollup2
PROFITS WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF

00:31:23.615 --> 00:31:26.752 region:rollup2
CLEARLY DEFINED LAWS AND

00:31:25.217 --> 00:31:28.487 region:rollup2
EXPECTATIONS THAT'S WHAT I THINK

00:31:26.752 --> 00:31:29.521 region:rollup2
WE NEED THAT SOMETIMES OUTSIDE

00:31:28.487 --> 00:31:30.489 region:rollup2
THOSE BOUNDARIES ARE AND NOW

00:31:29.521 --> 00:31:31.556 region:rollup2
IT'S ABSOLUTELY.

00:31:30.489 --> 00:31:33.291 region:rollup2
I WOULD HEAR THE LABOR

00:31:31.556 --> 00:31:34.993 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVES ONE FINAL QUESTION

00:31:33.291 --> 00:31:35.627 region:rollup2
REALLY ALONG THESE LINES YOU

00:31:34.993 --> 00:31:37.963 region:rollup2
BOTH REFERENCE.

00:31:35.627 --> 00:31:39.064 region:rollup2
THIS SOCIAL CHOICE IN THAT THERE

00:31:37.963 --> 00:31:41.066 region:rollup2
BE THE STRUCTURE SORT OF

00:31:39.064 --> 00:31:43.068 region:rollup2
CREATING EXPECTATIONS AND

00:31:41.066 --> 00:31:45.070 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES FOR HOW THE FUTURE OF

00:31:43.068 --> 00:31:46.037 region:rollup2
WORK PROCEEDS. IT YOU KNOW OUR

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:47.339 region:rollup2
THEIR EXISTING STRUCTURES THAT

00:31:46.037 --> 00:31:48.673 region:rollup2
YOU CAN POINT TO OUTSIDE OF

00:31:47.339 --> 00:31:49.474 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT BECAUSE IN MY

00:31:48.673 --> 00:31:52.010 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE.

00:31:49.474 --> 00:31:53.411 region:rollup2
INNOVATORS CREATE.

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:55.247 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T CONSULT GOVERNMENT

00:31:53.411 --> 00:31:57.115 region:rollup2
TO SAY WHAT RAGS WILL WE BE YOU

00:31:55.247 --> 00:31:58.750 region:rollup2
KNOW PASSED TO FOLLOW.

00:31:57.115 --> 00:32:01.686 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT TYPICALLY.

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:03.855 region:rollup2
REGULATES AFTER THE FACT LE.

00:32:01.686 --> 00:32:05.323 region:rollup2
INNOVATIONS GET CREATED AND THEN

00:32:03.855 --> 00:32:07.259 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT HEARS ABOUT THINGS

00:32:05.323 --> 00:32:08.693 region:rollup2
THAT ARE GOOD AND SOMETIMES NOT

00:32:07.259 --> 00:32:09.828 region:rollup2
GOOD AND THEN GOVERNMENT TRIES

00:32:08.693 --> 00:32:11.062 region:rollup2
TO TREAT THE ENVIRONMENT THAT

00:32:09.828 --> 00:32:12.330 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY WILL SUPPORT BUSINESS.

00:32:11.062 --> 00:32:13.598 region:rollup2
AND PROTECT THE WORKERS OF THOSE

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:15.467 region:rollup2
BUSINESS AT THE SAME TIME IT

00:32:13.598 --> 00:32:17.335 region:rollup2
SEEMS TO ME THAT THE WORK WILL

00:32:15.467 --> 00:32:19.604 region:rollup2
MOVE FORWARD BEFORE GOVERNMENT

00:32:17.335 --> 00:32:20.238 region:rollup2
IS IN A POSITION TO REALLY SET

00:32:19.604 --> 00:32:23.742 region:rollup2
THOSE GUIDELINES ARE THERE OTHER

00:32:20.238 --> 00:32:24.676 region:rollup2
STRUCTURES THAT. EXIST NOW THAT

00:32:23.742 --> 00:32:25.877 region:rollup2
YOU SEE DOING JUST THAT.

00:32:24.676 --> 00:32:28.213 region:rollup2
AND SO.

00:32:25.877 --> 00:32:30.081 region:rollup2
HI HOW ARE YOU.

00:32:28.213 --> 00:32:32.150 region:rollup2
I DON'T WANNA GIVE I DO WANT TO

00:32:30.081 --> 00:32:33.819 region:rollup2
GIVE UP THE IDEA THAT WE AS.

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:34.586 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT CAN ACT QUICKLY

00:32:33.819 --> 00:32:36.588 region:rollup2
ENOUGH.

00:32:34.586 --> 00:32:37.222 region:rollup2
TO BEGIN TO SET UP THOSE

00:32:36.588 --> 00:32:39.624 region:rollup2
STRUCTURES.

00:32:37.222 --> 00:32:41.593 region:rollup2
I THINK ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

00:32:39.624 --> 00:32:43.328 region:rollup2
GOVERNANCE IS A REALLY GREAT

00:32:41.593 --> 00:32:45.330 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE WHERE.

00:32:43.328 --> 00:32:48.333 region:rollup2
IN THE TECH IN THE TECH SECTOR

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:49.968 region:rollup2
ITSELF I'M EVEN HEADS OF THOSE

00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:52.370 region:rollup2
COMPANIES ARE STARTING TO SAY WE

00:32:49.968 --> 00:32:54.072 region:rollup2
NEED A FRAMEWORK FOR ETHICS ON

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:55.540 region:rollup2
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RIGHT.

00:32:54.072 --> 00:32:56.775 region:rollup2
AND HAVE ALREADY CREATED THEIR

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:58.210 region:rollup2
OWN STRUCTURES LIKE THE

00:32:56.775 --> 00:33:00.078 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP ON A AYE.

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:01.913 region:rollup2
I THINK WE SHOULD BE MOVING

00:33:00.078 --> 00:33:03.215 region:rollup2
QUICKLY TO SAY ACTUALLY THAT

00:33:01.913 --> 00:33:04.382 region:rollup2
SPACE.

00:33:03.215 --> 00:33:06.384 region:rollup2
FOR TALKING ABOUT WHAT ARE THE

00:33:04.382 --> 00:33:09.221 region:rollup2
GOALS OF TECHNOLOGY AND WHAT WE

00:33:06.384 --> 00:33:11.523 region:rollup2
OPTIMIZING FOR THAT SHOULD BE

00:33:09.221 --> 00:33:13.225 region:rollup2
BASED IN GOVERNMENT AND I HAVE

00:33:11.523 --> 00:33:14.826 region:rollup2
SEEN SOME INTERESTING BECAUSE IN

00:33:13.225 --> 00:33:16.394 region:rollup2
THE UK FOR ESTABLISHING A

00:33:14.826 --> 00:33:17.963 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT BASED.

00:33:16.394 --> 00:33:20.332 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT.

00:33:17.963 --> 00:33:21.466 region:rollup2
A STRUCTURE THAT DOES INCLUDE

00:33:20.332 --> 00:33:22.467 region:rollup2
THE TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES

00:33:21.466 --> 00:33:24.536 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES.

00:33:22.467 --> 00:33:26.004 region:rollup2
BUT WHERE GOVERNMENT IS THE ONE

00:33:24.536 --> 00:33:27.639 region:rollup2
THAT'S DOING THE CONVENING ON

00:33:26.004 --> 00:33:29.741 region:rollup2
RAISING THE QUESTIONS ABOUT.

00:33:27.639 --> 00:33:30.909 region:rollup2
TO WHAT ND AND SO I JUST

00:33:29.741 --> 00:33:33.378 region:rollup2
WANTED TO RAISE THAT UP.

00:33:30.909 --> 00:33:35.046 region:rollup2
IN PART AS A SECOND ANSWERED TO

00:33:33.378 --> 00:33:36.281 region:rollup2
THE PREVIOUS QUESTION.

00:33:35.046 --> 00:33:38.683 region:rollup2
WE.

00:33:36.281 --> 00:33:40.552 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT FIGURING

00:33:38.683 --> 00:33:41.987 region:rollup2
OUT WHO WILL BEAR THE RISK I

00:33:40.552 --> 00:33:42.921 region:rollup2
THINK WE SHOULD BE ASKING TO

00:33:41.987 --> 00:33:44.556 region:rollup2
WHAT AND.

00:33:42.921 --> 00:33:46.858 region:rollup2
AND WHAT DO WE ACTUALLY WANT

00:33:44.556 --> 00:33:48.793 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY TO DO. IN THE

00:33:46.858 --> 00:33:50.362 region:rollup2
ENGINEERING WORLD THEY CALL THIS

00:33:48.793 --> 00:33:52.097 region:rollup2
THE AUGMENTATION VERSES

00:33:50.362 --> 00:33:54.866 region:rollup2
AUTOMATION DECISION THERE IS A

00:33:52.097 --> 00:33:55.834 region:rollup2
DESIGN CHOICE HERE AYE WE'D JUST

00:33:54.866 --> 00:33:57.402 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING AND DESIGNING

00:33:55.834 --> 00:33:59.738 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES JUST TO REDUCE

00:33:57.402 --> 00:34:01.640 region:rollup2
COSTS JUST TO REDUCE EFFICIENCY.

00:33:59.738 --> 00:34:03.675 region:rollup2
AND THEREFORE OFTEN RESULTING

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:05.143 region:rollup2
DISPLACED WORKERS OR ARE WE

00:34:03.675 --> 00:34:07.412 region:rollup2
GOING TO DESIGN TECHNOLOGY TO

00:34:05.143 --> 00:34:08.513 region:rollup2
AUGMENT WORKERS I MAKE THEM MORE

00:34:07.412 --> 00:34:10.448 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVE BUT THEY ARE STILL ON

00:34:08.513 --> 00:34:12.450 region:rollup2
THE JOB THIS IS NOT LIKE A SORT

00:34:10.448 --> 00:34:13.018 region:rollup2
OF A PIPE DREAM RIGHT THIS COMES

00:34:12.450 --> 00:34:15.020 region:rollup2
DOWN TO AT THE POINT IN THE

00:34:13.018 --> 00:34:16.955 region:rollup2
LABS.

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:17.856 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE YOU CONCEIVABLE OF

00:34:16.955 --> 00:34:19.991 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT

00:34:17.856 --> 00:34:21.026 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURING ARE YOU GOING TO

00:34:19.991 --> 00:34:21.559 region:rollup2
LEVERAGE THE FACT THAT THERE IS

00:34:21.026 --> 00:34:22.928 region:rollup2
AN EXPERIENCED WORK ON THE

00:34:21.559 --> 00:34:24.329 region:rollup2
FLOOR?

00:34:22.928 --> 00:34:26.398 region:rollup2
AND SURROUND THAT WORKER WITH

00:34:24.329 --> 00:34:28.033 region:rollup2
NEW TECHNOLOGY OR YOU GONNA MAKE

00:34:26.398 --> 00:34:30.368 region:rollup2
THAT WORKER OBSOLETE AYE THING

00:34:28.033 --> 00:34:32.470 region:rollup2
IN INDUSTRY AFTER INDUSTRY THAT

00:34:30.368 --> 00:34:34.339 region:rollup2
IS THE KEY FIRST DECISION DEBT

00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:36.007 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT. HOW TO

THEREBY DELIVERING MORE AND

00:40:37.068 --> 00:40:41.139 region:rollup2
DOING IT WITH LESS INJURIES.

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:42.807 region:rollup2
SO WE WORKED WITH THE SUPERVISOR

00:40:41.139 --> 00:40:44.575 region:rollup2
TO AMEND THE LEGISLATION SO THAT

00:40:42.807 --> 00:40:46.678 region:rollup2
COMPANIES CAN GET PERMITS TO

00:40:44.575 --> 00:40:48.212 region:rollup2
TEST THESE ROBOTS BASED ON THE

00:40:46.678 --> 00:40:50.648 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING CONDITIONS.

00:40:48.212 --> 00:40:52.350 region:rollup2
ONE THEY HAD TO BE ACTUALLY

00:40:50.648 --> 00:40:54.786 region:rollup2
BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO.

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:56.087 region:rollup2
TO THEY HAD TO HAVE LABOR PEACE.

00:40:54.786 --> 00:40:58.756 region:rollup2
MEANING THESE HAD TO BE

00:40:56.087 --> 00:41:02.260 region:rollup2
COMPANIES THAT WERE CREATING.

00:40:58.756 --> 00:41:03.628 region:rollup2
GOOD LOCAL UNION JOBS.

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:05.530 region:rollup2
AND WE WORKED OUT A DEAL WITH

00:41:03.628 --> 00:41:07.098 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE MANUFACTURERS SO THAT

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:08.1000 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY MOVE FROM THE TESTING

00:41:07.098 --> 00:41:10.868 region:rollup2
IN TO THE MANUFACTURING AND

00:41:08.1000 --> 00:41:11.903 region:rollup2
DEPLOYMENT PHASE.

00:41:10.868 --> 00:41:14.772 region:rollup2
THESE ROBOTS ARE GOING TO BE

00:41:11.903 --> 00:41:16.341 region:rollup2
BUILT AND OPERATED BY TEAMSTERS.

00:41:14.772 --> 00:41:18.076 region:rollup2
WE STARTED OUT AS A UNION

00:41:16.341 --> 00:41:19.243 region:rollup2
OPERATING TEAMS OF HORSES WERE

00:41:18.076 --> 00:41:21.179 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE OPERATING TEAMS OF

00:41:19.243 --> 00:41:24.515 region:rollup2
ROBOTS.

00:41:21.179 --> 00:41:26.617 region:rollup2
THAT'S INNOVATION TO ME.

00:41:24.515 --> 00:41:28.019 region:rollup2
BACK HERE IN SACRAMENTO LAST

00:41:26.617 --> 00:41:29.754 region:rollup2
YEAR WE WORKED WITH ASSEMBLY

00:41:28.019 --> 00:41:31.289 region:rollup2
MEMBER BERMAN.

00:41:29.754 --> 00:41:33.624 region:rollup2
AND A COMPANY CALLED PELOTON

00:41:31.289 --> 00:41:35.560 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY ON A BILL CALLED AB

00:41:33.624 --> 00:41:36.995 region:rollup2
SIX SIX NINE.

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:38.763 region:rollup2
THAT MADE SURE THAT WHEN

00:41:36.995 --> 00:41:40.932 region:rollup2
PLATOONS OF TRUCKS ARE BEING

00:41:38.763 --> 00:41:42.433 region:rollup2
TESTED IN CALIFORNIA WHERE

00:41:40.932 --> 00:41:45.269 region:rollup2
THERE'S ONE TRUCK THAT'S

00:41:42.433 --> 00:41:46.371 region:rollup2
WIRELESSLY CONTROLLING A CONVOY.

00:41:45.269 --> 00:41:48.639 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S A DRIVER WITH A

00:41:46.371 --> 00:41:49.173 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE IN

00:41:48.639 --> 00:41:50.908 region:rollup2
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE

00:41:49.173 --> 00:41:53.010 region:rollup2
TRUCKS.

00:41:50.908 --> 00:41:54.345 region:rollup2
AND AFTER TESTIFYING IN ANOTHER

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:56.647 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE

00:41:54.345 --> 00:41:58.950 region:rollup2
LAST MONTH I SPENT A LONG TIME

00:41:56.647 --> 00:42:00.918 region:rollup2
WITH THE HEAD OF INNOVATION FOR

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:03.621 region:rollup2
VOLVO OF NORTH AMERICA. TALKING

00:42:00.918 --> 00:42:05.323 region:rollup2
TO THEM AND THEY AGREED THAT IF

00:42:03.621 --> 00:42:06.858 region:rollup2
YOU WANT TO DEVELOP NEW TRUCK

00:42:05.323 --> 00:42:07.959 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY THE FIRST THING YOU

00:42:06.858 --> 00:42:09.560 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE DOING IS ACTUALLY

00:42:07.959 --> 00:42:10.661 region:rollup2
TALKING TO A PERSON WHO DRIVES A

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:13.097 region:rollup2
TRUCK.

00:42:10.661 --> 00:42:15.566 region:rollup2
THE BILL.

00:42:13.097 --> 00:42:17.935 region:rollup2
THIS IF THIS IS DONE RIGHT WITH

00:42:15.566 --> 00:42:20.138 region:rollup2
YOUR HELP THIS COULD ACTUALLY BE

00:42:17.935 --> 00:42:22.106 region:rollup2
GOOD FOR TRUCK DRIVERS IN INDIA

00:42:20.138 --> 00:42:23.508 region:rollup2
AND THE INDUSTRY.

00:42:22.106 --> 00:42:25.610 region:rollup2
BUT THAT BEING SAID NONE OF

00:42:23.508 --> 00:42:27.812 region:rollup2
THESE COMPANIES CAME TO US OF

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:29.647 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN VOLITION. THEY CAME

00:42:27.812 --> 00:42:30.982 region:rollup2
BECAUSE GOVERNMENT TOOK ACTION

00:42:29.647 --> 00:42:32.717 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU HELD HEARINGS

00:42:30.982 --> 00:42:34.619 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU PROPOSED REGULATION

00:42:32.717 --> 00:42:36.454 region:rollup2
AND LEGISLATION.

00:42:34.619 --> 00:42:38.956 region:rollup2
AND WE NEED THAT SORT OF ACTION

00:42:36.454 --> 00:42:41.192 region:rollup2
WE NEED LEADERSHIP.

00:42:38.956 --> 00:42:42.627 region:rollup2
IF YOU DON'T A THE OTHER

00:42:41.192 --> 00:42:43.961 region:rollup2
PANELISTS TALKED ABOUT THIS

00:42:42.627 --> 00:42:45.596 region:rollup2
COULD GO A VERY DIFFERENT

00:42:43.961 --> 00:42:46.898 region:rollup2
DIRECTION AND LET ME TALK

00:42:45.596 --> 00:42:48.933 region:rollup2
BRIEFLY ABOUT THAT OTHER

00:42:46.898 --> 00:42:51.102 region:rollup2
SCENARIO.

00:42:48.933 --> 00:42:52.603 region:rollup2
THE INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES MY

00:42:51.102 --> 00:42:54.238 region:rollup2
GAS ARE GONNA COME UP HERE AND

00:42:52.603 --> 00:42:56.707 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT.

00:42:54.238 --> 00:42:59.177 region:rollup2
AVOIDING REGULATION.

00:42:56.707 --> 00:42:59.677 region:rollup2
SO LET'S GO BACK TO THE DE. OF

00:42:59.177 --> 00:43:01.712 region:rollup2
TRACKING IN THE NINETEEN

00:42:59.677 --> 00:43:03.047 region:rollup2
EIGHTIES.

00:43:01.712 --> 00:43:04.782 region:rollup2
BEFORE THAT IT WAS A MIDDLE

00:43:03.047 --> 00:43:06.884 region:rollup2
CLASS JOB THERE WERE SONGS ON

00:43:04.782 --> 00:43:08.219 region:rollup2
THE RADIO WE SAW SMOKEY AND THE

00:43:06.884 --> 00:43:09.620 region:rollup2
BANDIT IN THE MOVIE THEATERS

00:43:08.219 --> 00:43:12.256 region:rollup2
HERE NOW.

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:14.459 region:rollup2
AFTER DEREGULATION AND THIS

00:43:12.256 --> 00:43:16.394 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR MODEL

00:43:14.459 --> 00:43:18.196 region:rollup2
ROSE OUT OF THE ASHES THAT WAS

00:43:16.394 --> 00:43:20.097 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT.

00:43:18.196 --> 00:43:21.933 region:rollup2
LOUDTHE TRUCKING COMPANIES TO

00:43:20.097 --> 00:43:23.267 region:rollup2
OUTSOURCE.

00:43:21.933 --> 00:43:24.569 region:rollup2
ALL THE COSTS AND RISKS OF

00:43:23.267 --> 00:43:26.337 region:rollup2
TRUCKING ON THE BACKS OF THE

00:43:24.569 --> 00:43:27.438 region:rollup2
WORKERS.

00:43:26.337 --> 00:43:29.874 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE AN INDEPENDENT

00:43:27.438 --> 00:43:31.843 region:rollup2
CONTRACTOR IS TREATED AS A SMALL

00:43:29.874 --> 00:43:34.078 region:rollup2
BUSINESS UNDER THE LAW AND CAN

00:43:31.843 --> 00:43:36.214 region:rollup2
ORGANIZE A UNION.

00:43:34.078 --> 00:43:37.548 region:rollup2
IN SHORT TIME TRUCKING WENT TO A

00:43:36.214 --> 00:43:39.650 region:rollup2
JOB WHERE PEOPLE ARE WORKING

00:43:37.548 --> 00:43:42.253 region:rollup2
SIXTY SEVENTY EIGHTY HOURS A

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:44.021 region:rollup2
WEEK. WITH NO BENEFITS NO SOCIAL

00:43:42.253 --> 00:43:45.857 region:rollup2
SECURITY NO WORKERS COMP NO

00:43:44.021 --> 00:43:48.359 region:rollup2
NOTHING MAKING LESS THAN MINIMUM

00:43:45.857 --> 00:43:50.328 region:rollup2
WAGE.

00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:53.197 region:rollup2
DOES THAT SOUND FAMILIAR.

00:43:50.328 --> 00:43:55.133 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE UBER AND LEFT MODEL.

00:43:53.197 --> 00:43:56.701 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOTHING NEW ABOUT THIS

00:43:55.133 --> 00:43:58.369 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOTHING INNOVATIVE THE

00:43:56.701 --> 00:44:00.638 region:rollup2
ONLY THING THAT'S NEW IS THE

00:43:58.369 --> 00:44:02.707 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY.

00:44:00.638 --> 00:44:06.677 region:rollup2
AND SHORT OF BOLD ACTION ON YOUR

00:44:02.707 --> 00:44:08.346 region:rollup2
PART THIS IS THE FUTURE OF WORK.

00:44:06.677 --> 00:44:10.548 region:rollup2
AS IT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT THEIR

00:44:08.346 --> 00:44:12.650 region:rollup2
MAYBE ACTUALLY NET NEW JOBS IN

00:44:10.548 --> 00:44:14.151 region:rollup2
IN LOGISTICS WORK AND SUPPLY

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:15.586 region:rollup2
CHAIN.

00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:17.421 region:rollup2
.

00:44:15.586 --> 00:44:19.624 region:rollup2
DESPITE AUTOMATION DESPITE THE

00:44:17.421 --> 00:44:21.325 region:rollup2
AMAZON A FACT.

00:44:19.624 --> 00:44:22.827 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU DON'T TAKE ACTION.

00:44:21.325 --> 00:44:25.062 region:rollup2
THESE COULD BE INDEPENDENT

00:44:22.827 --> 00:44:27.598 region:rollup2
CONTRACTOR JOBS AND PEOPLE.

00:44:25.062 --> 00:44:29.033 region:rollup2
DOING GIGS.

00:44:27.598 --> 00:44:31.435 region:rollup2
THAT MAY ACTUALLY BE THE REAL

00:44:29.033 --> 00:44:33.237 region:rollup2
APOCALYPSE AN ECONOMY THAT FAILS

00:44:31.435 --> 00:44:34.205 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL FULL TIME

00:44:33.237 --> 00:44:35.973 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:44:34.205 --> 00:44:37.441 region:rollup2
PEOPLE.

00:44:35.973 --> 00:44:40.478 region:rollup2
SO LAST THING. WHAT SHOULD YOU

00:44:37.441 --> 00:44:42.313 region:rollup2
BE DOING?

00:44:40.478 --> 00:44:44.048 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME GETS

00:44:42.313 --> 00:44:47.084 region:rollup2
TOSSED AROUND A LOT.

00:44:44.048 --> 00:44:49.587 region:rollup2
IT SOUNDS NICE BUT WHO PAYS FOR.

00:44:47.084 --> 00:44:52.156 region:rollup2
PORTABLE BENEFITS.

00:44:49.587 --> 00:44:54.625 region:rollup2
INTERESTING IDEA BUT NOT ALLOWS

00:44:52.156 --> 00:44:55.693 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS TO MISS CLASSIFY THEIR

00:44:54.625 --> 00:44:57.528 region:rollup2
WORKERS AS INDEPENDENT

00:44:55.693 --> 00:44:58.095 region:rollup2
CONTRACTORS AND AVOID PAYING

00:44:57.528 --> 00:45:00.097 region:rollup2
INTO EXISTING SOCIAL SAFETY

00:44:58.095 --> 00:45:02.066 region:rollup2
NETS.

00:45:00.097 --> 00:45:03.367 region:rollup2
RETRAINING.

00:45:02.066 --> 00:45:06.204 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER HEARING

00:45:03.367 --> 00:45:06.804 region:rollup2
ON THE FAILURES OF RETRAINING

00:45:06.204 --> 00:45:08.439 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO FIX

00:45:06.804 --> 00:45:09.840 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:45:08.439 --> 00:45:11.742 region:rollup2
I WOULD SUGGEST IT'S TIME TO GO

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:13.678 region:rollup2
BIG.

00:45:11.742 --> 00:45:15.947 region:rollup2
IN NINETEEN TWENTY NINE AMERICAN

00:45:13.678 --> 00:45:17.481 region:rollup2
WORKERS HAD FULL EMPLOYMENT

00:45:15.947 --> 00:45:19.650 region:rollup2
UNEMPLOYMENT WAS AT THREE POINT

00:45:17.481 --> 00:45:21.218 region:rollup2
TWO PERCENT.

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:23.120 region:rollup2
BY NINETEEN THIRTY THREE WALL

00:45:21.218 --> 00:45:24.021 region:rollup2
STREET HAD PLUNGE THE COUNTRY

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:26.557 region:rollup2
INTO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT

00:45:24.021 --> 00:45:28.960 region:rollup2
UNEMPLOYMENT FIFTEEN MILLION

00:45:26.557 --> 00:45:31.596 region:rollup2
WORKERS WERE OUT ON THE STREETS.

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:33.564 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE WAS NOT TO

00:45:31.596 --> 00:45:35.032 region:rollup2
BAIL OUT WALL STREET BECAUSE

00:45:33.564 --> 00:45:36.367 region:rollup2
THEY WERE TOO BIG TO FAIL.

00:45:35.032 --> 00:45:38.336 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT BAILED OUT THE REST

00:45:36.367 --> 00:45:40.071 region:rollup2
OF US.

00:45:38.336 --> 00:45:42.807 region:rollup2
THEY PASSED THE SOCIAL SECURITY

00:45:40.071 --> 00:45:44.542 region:rollup2
ACT IN NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE.

00:45:42.807 --> 00:45:46.277 region:rollup2
IN NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE DAY

00:45:44.542 --> 00:45:48.779 region:rollup2
PASSED THE NATIONAL LABOR

00:45:46.277 --> 00:45:49.814 region:rollup2
RELATIONS ACT. AND THEY SAID.

00:45:48.779 --> 00:45:51.148 region:rollup2
THEY NEEDED TO PROTECT THE

00:45:49.814 --> 00:45:52.516 region:rollup2
RIGHTS OF EMPLOYEES AND

00:45:51.148 --> 00:45:54.452 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS TO ENCOURAGE

00:45:52.516 --> 00:45:56.687 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND TO

00:45:54.452 --> 00:45:58.456 region:rollup2
CURTAIL CERTAIN PRIVATE SECTOR

00:45:56.687 --> 00:46:00.224 region:rollup2
LABOR AND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES

00:45:58.456 --> 00:46:02.426 region:rollup2
WHICH CAN HARM. THE GENERAL

00:46:00.224 --> 00:46:03.995 region:rollup2
WELFARE OF WORKERS BUSINESSES IN

00:46:02.426 --> 00:46:04.996 region:rollup2
THE ECONOMY.

00:46:03.995 --> 00:46:06.998 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD SOUND RADICAL IN

00:46:04.996 --> 00:46:08.432 region:rollup2
TODAY'S CONGRESS.

00:46:06.998 --> 00:46:09.500 region:rollup2
IN NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT THEY

00:46:08.432 --> 00:46:10.901 region:rollup2
PASSED THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:13.638 region:rollup2
ACT.

00:46:10.901 --> 00:46:15.573 region:rollup2
OVERTIME EIGHT HOUR DAY NO CHILD

00:46:13.638 --> 00:46:17.608 region:rollup2
LABOR MINIMUM WAGE.

00:46:15.573 --> 00:46:19.010 region:rollup2
IT'S TIME TO GO BIG. THAT'S THE

00:46:17.608 --> 00:46:21.045 region:rollup2
REAL INNOVATION THAT WE NEED

00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:26.317 region:rollup2

MEMBERS THAT HAVE NOT SHOWN UP

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:42.833 region:rollup2

ON THESE ISSUES AYE. OUTSIDE OF

00:46:46.137 --> 00:46:48.372 region:rollup2
GLOBAL WARMING AND CLIMATE

00:46:47.405 --> 00:46:49.540 region:rollup2
CHANGE I THINK THIS IS THE

00:46:48.372 --> 00:46:52.309 region:rollup2
CRITICAL QUESTION OF OUR TIME

00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:52.610 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT IS THE FUTURE WORK

00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:53.611 region:rollup2
LOOK LIKE.

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:55.713 region:rollup2
IT WORKERS.

00:46:53.611 --> 00:46:57.715 region:rollup2
I'M WORKERS DO NOT WANT A

00:46:55.713 --> 00:46:59.283 region:rollup2
HANDOUT THERE'S DIGNITY AND WORK

00:46:57.715 --> 00:47:00.151 region:rollup2
THERE IS MEANING IN WORK AND

00:46:59.283 --> 00:47:01.686 region:rollup2
WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE

00:47:00.151 --> 00:47:03.421 region:rollup2
CAN CONTINUE TO CREATE THAT

00:47:01.686 --> 00:47:04.355 region:rollup2
DIGNITY MEANING. I THINK THERE

00:47:03.421 --> 00:47:06.190 region:rollup2
ARE TWO QUESTIONS

00:47:04.355 --> 00:47:08.059 region:rollup2
AS WE THINK ABOUT THESE BIG BIG

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:09.560 region:rollup2
ISSUES NUMBER ONE IS THE

00:47:08.059 --> 00:47:11.295 region:rollup2
QUESTION AROUND TECHNOLOGIES

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:12.363 region:rollup2
IMPACT ON OUR WORK.

00:47:11.295 --> 00:47:13.531 region:rollup2
I WANNA TALK WITHOUT A SECOND

00:47:12.363 --> 00:47:14.999 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THERE'S ANOTHER

00:47:13.531 --> 00:47:16.567 region:rollup2
PIECE OF THIS ESPECIALLY WHERE

00:47:14.999 --> 00:47:17.535 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT PLAYS A BIG ROLE. AND

00:47:16.567 --> 00:47:20.004 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE ACTUAL UNDERLYING

00:47:17.535 --> 00:47:21.772 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC STRUCTURE THAT DRIVES

00:47:20.004 --> 00:47:23.074 region:rollup2
THAT DRIVES HIS DECISIONS. IF

00:47:21.772 --> 00:47:25.276 region:rollup2
YOU LOOK AT OUR INDUSTRY IN THE

00:47:23.074 --> 00:47:26.711 region:rollup2
YOU SCW WE REPRESENT RETAIL

00:47:25.276 --> 00:47:28.713 region:rollup2
WHERE THE RETAIL CLERKS UNION ME

00:47:26.711 --> 00:47:30.214 region:rollup2
CUTTERS IN FOOD PROCESSING WE

00:47:28.713 --> 00:47:31.215 region:rollup2
REPRESENT A LOT OF WORKERS IN

00:47:30.214 --> 00:47:32.950 region:rollup2
THE RETAIL SPACE.

00:47:31.215 --> 00:47:35.386 region:rollup2
AND A LOT OF THE LARGEST

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:35.953 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS IN OUR IN OUR SECTOR

00:47:35.386 --> 00:47:38.022 region:rollup2
ARE OWNED BY PRIVATE EQUITY

00:47:35.953 --> 00:47:39.423 region:rollup2
COMPANIES.

00:47:38.022 --> 00:47:41.025 region:rollup2
SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN.

00:47:39.423 --> 00:47:41.759 region:rollup2
FORTY THREE LARGE RETAIL

00:47:41.025 --> 00:47:44.095 region:rollup2
SUPERMARKET COMPANIES WHICH

00:47:41.759 --> 00:47:44.829 region:rollup2
OWNED TEN OR MORE STORES HAVE

00:47:44.095 --> 00:47:46.731 region:rollup2
FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY IN UNITED

00:47:44.829 --> 00:47:48.265 region:rollup2
STATES. AND EIGHTEEN OF THOSE

00:47:46.731 --> 00:47:49.467 region:rollup2
COMPANIES ARE OWNED BY PRIVATE

00:47:48.265 --> 00:47:50.768 region:rollup2
EQUITY.

00:47:49.467 --> 00:47:52.336 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT YOU KNOW

00:47:50.768 --> 00:47:53.504 region:rollup2
THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE IS TOYS

00:47:52.336 --> 00:47:54.572 region:rollup2
R. US EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT

00:47:53.504 --> 00:47:55.306 region:rollup2
TOYS R. US.

00:47:54.572 --> 00:47:56.941 region:rollup2
TOYS R. US WITH THEIR EIGHT

00:47:55.306 --> 00:47:57.842 region:rollup2
HUNDRED STORES AND THIRTY

00:47:56.941 --> 00:47:58.843 region:rollup2
THOUSAND WORKERS ARE GONNA BE

00:47:57.842 --> 00:48:00.311 region:rollup2
OUT OF A JOB THE STORES IN A

00:47:58.843 --> 00:48:02.179 region:rollup2
CLOSE.

00:48:00.311 --> 00:48:03.381 region:rollup2
AND SURE AMAZON AND OTHER ONLINE

00:48:02.179 --> 00:48:05.082 region:rollup2
RETAILERS HAVE CREATED

00:48:03.381 --> 00:48:06.283 region:rollup2
COMPETITION. BUT REALLY WHAT'S

00:48:05.082 --> 00:48:07.251 region:rollup2
HAPPENING IN THE UNDERLYING

00:48:06.283 --> 00:48:09.153 region:rollup2
PIECE OF THIS IS THE FACT THAT

00:48:07.251 --> 00:48:10.521 region:rollup2
THESE ARE COMPANIES ARE OWNED BY

00:48:09.153 --> 00:48:11.956 region:rollup2
PRIVATE EQUITY LIKE BAIN CAPITAL

00:48:10.521 --> 00:48:14.325 region:rollup2
WHO GET LOADED WITH DEBT AND

00:48:11.956 --> 00:48:15.960 region:rollup2
THEN CAN'T PY CAN'T PAY OFF.

00:48:14.325 --> 00:48:17.328 region:rollup2
THE INTEREST ON THE DEBT NOT WE

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:18.863 region:rollup2
HAVE TO DECLARE BANKRUPTCY AND

00:48:17.328 --> 00:48:20.664 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT BANKRUPTCY.

00:48:18.863 --> 00:48:22.299 region:rollup2
WHO ACTUALLY GETS PAID THE

00:48:20.664 --> 00:48:23.801 region:rollup2
WORKERS WITHOUT JOBS IN THE LEFT

00:48:22.299 --> 00:48:25.336 region:rollup2
WITH LITTLE TO NOTHING IN THE

00:48:23.801 --> 00:48:26.804 region:rollup2
SHAREHOLDERS GET MADE WHOLE?

00:48:25.336 --> 00:48:28.873 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY SAW THE ASSETS THIS IS

00:48:26.804 --> 00:48:30.408 region:rollup2
ANOTHER MAJOR PIECE OF JUST

00:48:28.873 --> 00:48:32.109 region:rollup2
WHAT'S DRIVING THIS THIS

00:48:30.408 --> 00:48:33.244 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION IS YOU HAVE

00:48:32.109 --> 00:48:35.312 region:rollup2
COMPANIES LIKE AMAZON WHO ARE

00:48:33.244 --> 00:48:38.282 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY. REINVESTING IN THEIR

00:48:35.312 --> 00:48:39.550 region:rollup2
COMPANY NOT TAKING ASSETS OUT

00:48:38.282 --> 00:48:40.818 region:rollup2
EXTRACTING ACCESO BUT ACTUALLY

00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:42.119 region:rollup2
PUTTING ASSETS BACK INTO CREE

00:48:40.818 --> 00:48:44.655 region:rollup2
LARGER VALUE AND THE

00:48:42.119 --> 00:48:47.024 region:rollup2
CAPITALIZING ON THE LOSS OF

00:48:44.655 --> 00:48:47.925 region:rollup2
BRICK AND MORTAR TAKE TO OPEN UP

00:48:47.024 --> 00:48:49.660 region:rollup2
THAT SPACE IN RETAIL SO I

00:48:47.925 --> 00:48:50.861 region:rollup2
BELIEVE. THAT'S ANOTHER LARGE

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:52.430 region:rollup2
QUESTION THAT'S NOT THE SUBJECT

00:48:50.861 --> 00:48:53.831 region:rollup2
OF THIS HEARING BUT IT IS

00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:55.766 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY WE HAVE

00:48:53.831 --> 00:48:57.468 region:rollup2
TO PAY ATTENTION TO. IS THE

00:48:55.766 --> 00:48:59.069 region:rollup2
UNDERLYING ECONOMIC STRUCTURE

00:48:57.468 --> 00:49:00.871 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE CREATING IN THIS IN

00:48:59.069 --> 00:49:01.739 region:rollup2
THIS COUNTRY AND IN THE WORLD.

00:49:00.871 --> 00:49:03.374 region:rollup2
AND I THINK BOTH THE FEDERAL

00:49:01.739 --> 00:49:04.408 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT THE STATE GOVERNMENT

00:49:03.374 --> 00:49:06.510 region:rollup2
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE A

00:49:04.408 --> 00:49:08.345 region:rollup2
REAL ROLE TO PLAY IN TERMS OF

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:09.180 region:rollup2
CREATING DISINCENTIVES. AROUND

00:49:08.345 --> 00:49:12.016 region:rollup2
THIS RESTRUCTURING AND

00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:13.818 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY UNDERMINES OUR

00:49:12.016 --> 00:49:15.186 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO CREATE WORK.

00:49:13.818 --> 00:49:16.887 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF

00:49:15.186 --> 00:49:18.622 region:rollup2
THAT QUESTION ABOUT WHAT'S THE

00:49:16.887 --> 00:49:19.190 region:rollup2
IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY IN OUR. IN

00:49:18.622 --> 00:49:21.759 region:rollup2
OUR SECTORS I WILL TELL YOU

00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:23.794 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:49:21.759 --> 00:49:25.930 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE JUST REITERATE WHAT

00:49:23.794 --> 00:49:26.964 region:rollup2
WAS SAID HERE THAT WE KNOW THAT

00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:28.732 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

00:49:26.964 --> 00:49:30.935 region:rollup2
EMBRACE THIS CHANGE AND ACTUALLY

00:49:28.732 --> 00:49:32.603 region:rollup2
CAPITALIZE ON THE POWER OF THE

00:49:30.935 --> 00:49:33.671 region:rollup2
WORK FORCE. TO MAKE THIS

00:49:32.603 --> 00:49:35.005 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND

00:49:33.671 --> 00:49:37.274 region:rollup2
INNOVATION WORK FOR WORKERS WORK

00:49:35.005 --> 00:49:38.876 region:rollup2
FOR SOCIETY. YOU KNOW ONLY A

00:49:37.274 --> 00:49:41.011 region:rollup2
STUDY BY MCKINSEY.

00:49:38.876 --> 00:49:42.313 region:rollup2
I CAME OUT WHERE IT SAID SIXTY

00:49:41.011 --> 00:49:43.747 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF JOBS

00:49:42.313 --> 00:49:45.149 region:rollup2
SIX PERCENT OF JOBS CAN HAVE AT

00:49:43.747 --> 00:49:46.851 region:rollup2
LEAST THIRTY PERCENT OF THEIR

00:49:45.149 --> 00:49:48.319 region:rollup2
WORK AUTOMATED.

00:49:46.851 --> 00:49:49.486 region:rollup2
SO THINK ABOUT THAT SO IT'S NOT

00:49:48.319 --> 00:49:50.888 region:rollup2
AS MASSIVE AS A HUNDRED PERCENT

00:49:49.486 --> 00:49:51.956 region:rollup2
BUT SIXTY PERCENT OF THOSE JOBS

00:49:50.888 --> 00:49:53.824 region:rollup2
CAN HAVE THIRTY PERCENT OF THEIR

00:49:51.956 --> 00:49:55.626 region:rollup2
WORK AUTOMATED. AND I THINK A

00:49:53.824 --> 00:49:57.528 region:rollup2
PART OF THIS A REAL BIG PART OF

00:49:55.626 --> 00:49:58.929 region:rollup2
THIS IS. WHEN YOU WHEN YOU LOOK

00:49:57.528 --> 00:50:00.531 region:rollup2
AT WHAT OUR ACTUAL UNDERLYING

00:49:58.929 --> 00:50:03.567 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE LOOKS

00:50:00.531 --> 00:50:04.835 region:rollup2
LIKE. YOU KNOW AND IN WHILE.

00:50:03.567 --> 00:50:06.604 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THE WAY THAT WE

00:50:04.835 --> 00:50:08.372 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY TRAIN WORKERS AND DO

00:50:06.604 --> 00:50:10.140 region:rollup2
THIS IN AND CREATE A TRANSITION

00:50:08.372 --> 00:50:11.675 region:rollup2
IN THIS ECONOMY. IS GONNA BE KEY

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:13.477 region:rollup2
TO HOW WE ACTUALLY HAVE WORKERS

00:50:11.675 --> 00:50:15.246 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO. TO CONTINUE TO DO

00:50:13.477 --> 00:50:17.248 region:rollup2
THE JOBS NECESSARY AND ACTUALLY

00:50:15.246 --> 00:50:19.683 region:rollup2
CREATE VALUE FOR COMPANIES AND

00:50:17.248 --> 00:50:21.418 region:rollup2
VALUE FOR CONSUMERS IN A WAY

00:50:19.683 --> 00:50:23.254 region:rollup2
THAT NO ONE ELSE CAN.

00:50:21.418 --> 00:50:24.889 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW WE GET AS WE INVEST

00:50:23.254 --> 00:50:26.457 region:rollup2
IN THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT

00:50:24.889 --> 00:50:27.758 region:rollup2
HOW WE CAN ALSO EMPOWER WORKERS

00:50:26.457 --> 00:50:29.493 region:rollup2
AND THAT THAT WAS EXAMPLES.

00:50:27.758 --> 00:50:31.462 region:rollup2
GIVEN EARLIER ABOUT WHAT WAS

00:50:29.493 --> 00:50:32.429 region:rollup2
GOING ON IN GERMANY. THE MOST

00:50:31.462 --> 00:50:33.697 region:rollup2
RECENT EXAMPLE IS BETWEEN THE

00:50:32.429 --> 00:50:35.432 region:rollup2
GERMAN GOVERNMENT THE GERMAN

00:50:33.697 --> 00:50:37.167 region:rollup2
STEEL WORKERS UNION AND THE

00:50:35.432 --> 00:50:39.436 region:rollup2
GERMAN STEEL INDUSTRY WHERE THEY

00:50:37.167 --> 00:50:40.504 region:rollup2
WILL TO NEGOTIATE CHANGES.

00:50:39.436 --> 00:50:41.872 region:rollup2
AROUND THEIR WORKING CONDITIONS

00:50:40.504 --> 00:50:43.374 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT

00:50:41.872 --> 00:50:44.909 region:rollup2
THE EIGHT HOUR DAY WILL THINK

00:50:43.374 --> 00:50:46.443 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW WE CAN RESTRUCTURING.

00:50:44.909 --> 00:50:47.912 region:rollup2
A DATA MAY YOU BE LESS THAN AN

00:50:46.443 --> 00:50:49.280 region:rollup2
EIGHT HOUR DAY FOR THE SAME PAY

00:50:47.912 --> 00:50:50.548 region:rollup2
IN GERMANY THEY REDUCE THE WITH

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:52.416 region:rollup2
THE DAY FROM A WEEK FROM THIRTY

00:50:50.548 --> 00:50:53.918 region:rollup2
SIX HOURS A WEEK TO TWENTY EIGHT

00:50:52.416 --> 00:50:54.885 region:rollup2
HOURS A WEEK. AT THE SAME TIME

00:50:53.918 --> 00:50:56.820 region:rollup2
WE'RE ABLE TO GET A FOUR PERCENT

00:50:54.885 --> 00:50:58.622 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN THEIR SALARY IN PAY.

00:50:56.820 --> 00:51:00.457 region:rollup2
AND ALSO REINVESTED IN AND

00:50:58.622 --> 00:51:01.959 region:rollup2
TRAINING AND FACILITATION OF

00:51:00.457 --> 00:51:03.193 region:rollup2
GOING TO OTHER CAREERS AS

00:51:01.959 --> 00:51:05.362 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY IMPACTS THAT

00:51:03.193 --> 00:51:06.463 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE I THINK THOSE ARE SOME

00:51:05.362 --> 00:51:06.964 region:rollup2
IDEAS WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IN

00:51:06.463 --> 00:51:09.300 region:rollup2
TERMS OF.

00:51:06.964 --> 00:51:11.702 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IN TERMS OF

00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:22.413 region:rollup2
OUR ABILITY TO. TO.

00:51:11.702 --> 00:51:23.047 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT THAT AS WE MOVE

00:51:22.413 --> 00:51:23.681 region:rollup2
AHEAD IN THIS STRUCTURE. AND I

00:51:23.047 --> 00:51:24.348 region:rollup2
WILL SAY THE FINAL THING IS YOU

00:51:23.681 --> 00:51:24.915 region:rollup2
KNOW AMAZON GO BLUE APRON SELF

00:51:24.348 --> 00:51:25.516 region:rollup2
CHECKOUT APPLE PAY AND MANY

00:51:24.915 --> 00:51:25.983 region:rollup2
OTHER ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY

00:51:25.516 --> 00:51:26.250 region:rollup2
WILL CHANGE THE RETAIL

00:51:25.983 --> 00:51:26.784 region:rollup2
LANDSCAPE.

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:27.418 region:rollup2
BUT WILL NOT WHAT WILL NOT

00:51:26.784 --> 00:51:28.052 region:rollup2
CHANGE IS THAT EMPLOYERS THAT

00:51:27.418 --> 00:51:28.719 region:rollup2
CAN CREATE AN EXPERIENCE THAT

00:51:28.052 --> 00:51:29.253 region:rollup2
ATTRACTS PEOPLE TO THE BRICK AND

00:51:28.719 --> 00:51:29.787 region:rollup2
MORTAR. BRICK AND MORTAR

00:51:29.253 --> 00:51:31.322 region:rollup2
LOCATIONS THE OPPORTUNITY

00:51:29.787 --> 00:51:32.656 region:rollup2
RETRAIN WORKERS TO GAIN SOFT

00:51:31.322 --> 00:51:33.958 region:rollup2
SKILLS IN CUSTOMER SERVICE AS

00:51:32.656 --> 00:51:35.559 region:rollup2
WELL AS HARD SKILLS. LIKE

00:51:33.958 --> 00:51:37.027 region:rollup2
EXPANDING CULINARY TRAINING TO

00:51:35.559 --> 00:51:37.928 region:rollup2
THE RETAIL SITES WILL BE OF

00:51:37.027 --> 00:51:39.430 region:rollup2
VALUE ADDED.

00:51:37.928 --> 00:51:39.930 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT BANKRUPTCY OF TOYS

00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:41.165 region:rollup2
R. US IS JUST THE LATEST

00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:42.766 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE.

00:51:41.165 --> 00:51:44.368 region:rollup2
WELL ONLINE RETAILERS IS AMAZON

00:51:42.766 --> 00:51:45.169 region:rollup2
GO GROUPON AND OTHERS HAVE

00:51:44.368 --> 00:51:46.971 region:rollup2
PROVIDED COMPETITION BRICK AND

00:51:45.169 --> 00:51:48.138 region:rollup2
MORTAR. AGAIN I BELIEVE PRIVATE

00:51:46.971 --> 00:51:49.340 region:rollup2
EQUITIES ADVANCEMENTS THAT

00:51:48.138 --> 00:51:50.941 region:rollup2
RESELL SECTOR HAS REALLY

00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:52.142 region:rollup2
EXACERBATED THE PROBLEM.

00:51:50.941 --> 00:51:53.577 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO DO A BETTER

00:51:52.142 --> 00:51:54.979 region:rollup2
JOB AT REGULATING WALL STREET

00:51:53.577 --> 00:51:56.080 region:rollup2

PARTNERSHIPS WITH LABOR TO

00:51:57.348 --> 00:51:59.416 region:rollup2
DEVELOP A TRAINING. FOR THE

00:51:58.549 --> 00:52:01.185 region:rollup2
GREAT TRANSITION THAT IS

00:51:59.416 --> 00:52:01.952 region:rollup2
HAPPENING OUR ECONOMY TO PROTECT

00:52:01.185 --> 00:52:03.253 region:rollup2
THE RIGHTS OF WORKERS TO

ADVOCATE FOR THEIR PROFESSIONS

00:52:03.253 --> 00:52:06.023 region:rollup2
AND BY EXTENSION FOR CONSUMERS

00:52:04.655 --> 00:52:06.690 region:rollup2
TO CONSUME THE GOODS. THAT

00:52:06.023 --> 00:52:07.958 region:rollup2
WORKERS AND COMPANIES ARE

00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:09.560 region:rollup2

GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY THANK YOU

00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:35.986 region:rollup2
T. OR ON BEHALF OF THE SERVICE

00:52:34.551 --> 00:52:37.221 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION

00:52:35.986 --> 00:52:38.222 region:rollup2
I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF SEVEN

00:52:37.221 --> 00:52:39.823 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THOUSAND WORKERS

00:52:38.222 --> 00:52:41.525 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE AND I REALLY. WANT TO

00:52:39.823 --> 00:52:43.060 region:rollup2
TRY TO GIVE A PERSPECTIVE ON THE

00:52:41.525 --> 00:52:44.495 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC SECTOR IMPACT OF

00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:45.863 region:rollup2
AUTOMATION I THINK WE OFTEN

00:52:44.495 --> 00:52:47.164 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT AUTOMATION I THINK

00:52:45.863 --> 00:52:48.565 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE PRIVATE SECTOR I THINK

00:52:47.164 --> 00:52:50.334 region:rollup2
MY BROTHERS HAVE GIVEN. A GOOD

00:52:48.565 --> 00:52:51.568 region:rollup2
OVERVIEW OF OF THE FEAR AND THAT

00:52:50.334 --> 00:52:52.936 region:rollup2
THE COMPLEXITIES ON THE PRIVATE

00:52:51.568 --> 00:52:54.238 region:rollup2
SECTOR SIDE BUT ON THE PUBLIC

00:52:52.936 --> 00:52:56.440 region:rollup2
SECTOR SIDE.

00:52:54.238 --> 00:52:58.008 region:rollup2
THIS FEAR OF AUTOMATION AND HAS

00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:59.677 region:rollup2
REALLY TAKEN US BY STORM WE'VE

00:52:58.008 --> 00:53:00.544 region:rollup2
BEEN ENGAGED IN IT FOR A NUMBER

00:52:59.677 --> 00:53:01.879 region:rollup2
OF YEARS SO I HOPE TO GIVE YOU

00:53:00.544 --> 00:53:03.447 region:rollup2
GUYS SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW IT HAS

00:53:01.879 --> 00:53:04.415 region:rollup2
WORK TO OUR BENEFIT. BUT THEN

00:53:03.447 --> 00:53:06.150 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE

00:53:04.415 --> 00:53:07.317 region:rollup2
LEERY ABOUT ESPECIALLY AS WE'RE

00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:08.819 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT SAFETY NET

00:53:07.317 --> 00:53:10.587 region:rollup2
BENEFITS THAT I KNOW YOU TWO IN

00:53:08.819 --> 00:53:13.023 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR CARE DEEPLY ABOUT.

00:53:10.587 --> 00:53:13.991 region:rollup2
AND HOW AUTOMATION EFFECTS THAT

00:53:13.023 --> 00:53:15.759 region:rollup2
AFFECTS THE SERVICE DELIVERY.

00:53:13.991 --> 00:53:16.460 region:rollup2
I'M I THINK IF YOU'RE THINKING

00:53:15.759 --> 00:53:18.896 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:21.331 region:rollup2
OUR APPREHENSION ON INNOVATION

00:53:18.896 --> 00:53:23.100 region:rollup2
IT'S BECAUSE THAT A LOT OF IT IS

00:53:21.331 --> 00:53:24.334 region:rollup2
BASED ON COST SAVINGS AND IF YOU

00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:25.969 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT COST SAVINGS A

00:53:24.334 --> 00:53:27.271 region:rollup2
VENDOR WANTING TO COME TO A

00:53:25.969 --> 00:53:28.772 region:rollup2
PUBLIC AGENCY AND TALK ABOUT

00:53:27.271 --> 00:53:30.340 region:rollup2
COST SAVINGS IN THE SENSE OF OUR

00:53:28.772 --> 00:53:31.608 region:rollup2
SAFETY NET BENEFITS. THERE'S

00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:33.110 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY A FEAR THAT GOES WITH

00:53:31.608 --> 00:53:34.011 region:rollup2
IT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:35.379 region:rollup2
INNOVATION THAT'S A LITTLE BIT

00:53:34.011 --> 00:53:36.880 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT I THINK THAT OUR

00:53:35.379 --> 00:53:38.549 region:rollup2
WORKERS ON THE FRONT LINES WANT

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:40.050 region:rollup2
TO BE PART OF AN INNOVATION

00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:41.251 region:rollup2
STRATEGY AND A STRATEGY TO TRY

00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:43.087 region:rollup2
TO MAKE BENEFITS AND SERVICE

00:53:41.251 --> 00:53:44.321 region:rollup2
DELIVERY. MORE ACHIEVABLE AND

00:53:43.087 --> 00:53:45.889 region:rollup2
MORE CONVENIENT FOR THE CLIENTS

00:53:44.321 --> 00:53:47.858 region:rollup2
THAT WE SERVE BUT NOT FOR THE

00:53:45.889 --> 00:53:49.259 region:rollup2
PURPOSES SOLELY OF COST SAVINGS

00:53:47.858 --> 00:53:50.327 region:rollup2
WHICH I THINK HAS BEEN THE

00:53:49.259 --> 00:53:51.328 region:rollup2
PARAMOUNT OF A LOT OF THE

00:53:50.327 --> 00:53:53.697 region:rollup2
VENDORS THAT HAVE SHOPPED AROUND

00:53:51.328 --> 00:53:54.898 region:rollup2
THE CAPITAL. FOR YEAR OVER YEAR

00:53:53.697 --> 00:53:56.400 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY FOR EXAMPLE IN OUR

00:53:54.898 --> 00:53:57.968 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL PROGRAM YOU GUYS KNOW

00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:59.036 region:rollup2
THAT WE EXPANDED MEDI CAL SOME

00:53:57.968 --> 00:54:00.504 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO WHEN THERE WAS AN

00:53:59.036 --> 00:54:01.538 region:rollup2
ATTEMPT WHEN THAT ANSETT

00:54:00.504 --> 00:54:02.840 region:rollup2
HAPPENED THEY WOULD BE

00:54:01.538 --> 00:54:04.241 region:rollup2
PRIVATIZING IT WOULD BE

00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:05.642 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE CAN APPLY

00:54:04.241 --> 00:54:07.411 region:rollup2
THROUGH. THERE ITEM THERE'S

00:54:05.642 --> 00:54:08.745 region:rollup2
THEIR PHONES IN THEIR COMPUTERS

00:54:07.411 --> 00:54:09.880 region:rollup2
AT HOME AND THAT'S NOT THE

00:54:08.745 --> 00:54:11.248 region:rollup2
REALITY OF THE SAFETY NET

00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:12.649 region:rollup2
BENEFITS THAT WE PROVIDE

00:54:11.248 --> 00:54:14.084 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY IT ROLLED OUT

00:54:12.649 --> 00:54:15.085 region:rollup2
PRETTY FAST AND YOU GUYS WERE

00:54:14.084 --> 00:54:17.321 region:rollup2
VERY PARAMOUNT IN THOSE

00:54:15.085 --> 00:54:18.555 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS WHERE. THIS IDEA

00:54:17.321 --> 00:54:20.290 region:rollup2
OF AUTOMATION WAS KIND OF THE

00:54:18.555 --> 00:54:22.025 region:rollup2
PARAMOUNT IDEA OF HOW THESE

00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:23.527 region:rollup2
FOLKS WE GET SERVICE DELIVERY IT

00:54:22.025 --> 00:54:25.095 region:rollup2
WASN'T UNTIL AFTER IT DIDN'T

00:54:23.527 --> 00:54:26.029 region:rollup2
WORK FOR SOME TIME THAT WORKERS

00:54:25.095 --> 00:54:28.165 region:rollup2
BECAME FRIGHTENED CENTER IN THAT

00:54:26.029 --> 00:54:29.433 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION. THAT WORKERS WERE

00:54:28.165 --> 00:54:31.001 region:rollup2
AT THE FRONT LINES OF HOW

00:54:29.433 --> 00:54:32.603 region:rollup2
INNOVATION WORKS AND HOW THAT'S

00:54:31.001 --> 00:54:34.671 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FROM A COST SAVINGS

00:54:32.603 --> 00:54:35.806 region:rollup2
OUR GOAL IN MENTALITY THAT WE

00:54:34.671 --> 00:54:37.374 region:rollup2
THINK DROVE A LOT OF THE

00:54:35.806 --> 00:54:38.408 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION BEFORE. THE

00:54:37.374 --> 00:54:40.611 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE AND THAT IS WHEN THE

00:54:38.408 --> 00:54:41.912 region:rollup2
WORKERS GOT INVOLVED WE ACTUALLY

00:54:40.611 --> 00:54:43.947 region:rollup2
GAVE INPUT ON WHAT ALGORITHMS

00:54:41.912 --> 00:54:50.287 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY WORK TO GET PEOPLE

00:54:43.947 --> 00:54:50.287 region:rollup2
TRANSITION VARIOUS IT

00:54:50.354 --> 00:54:52.422 region:rollup2
SEE IF THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS WILL

00:54:51.021 --> 00:54:54.658 region:rollup2
LOCK UP. IF THE SYSTEMS WHEN

00:54:52.422 --> 00:54:56.093 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY WORK BECAUSE AT THE END

00:54:54.658 --> 00:54:57.327 region:rollup2
WHEN SOMETHING IN THE AUTOMATION

00:54:56.093 --> 00:54:59.062 region:rollup2
DOESN'T WORK ESPECIALLY FOR

00:54:57.327 --> 00:55:00.931 region:rollup2
SAFETY NET BENEFITS THEY COME TO

00:54:59.062 --> 00:55:02.432 region:rollup2
THE IN PERSON WORKER AT SOME

00:55:00.931 --> 00:55:04.034 region:rollup2
POINT TIME. AND THEY'RE VERY

00:55:02.432 --> 00:55:04.968 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATED AND THEY'VE BEEN

00:55:04.034 --> 00:55:06.303 region:rollup2
THROUGH A LONG PROCESS OF BEING

00:55:04.968 --> 00:55:07.604 region:rollup2
ON A PHONE CALL PRESSING ONE

00:55:06.303 --> 00:55:09.406 region:rollup2
PRESSING TO PRESSING THREE GOING

00:55:07.604 --> 00:55:11.141 region:rollup2
BACK TO ONE AND THEY CAN'T GET

00:55:09.406 --> 00:55:12.176 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY NEED. AS A BY THE TIME

00:55:11.141 --> 00:55:14.344 region:rollup2
THEY'RE IN THE FACE OF OUR

00:55:12.176 --> 00:55:15.779 region:rollup2
SOCIAL WORKERS ARE ELIGIBILITY

00:55:14.344 --> 00:55:17.114 region:rollup2
WORKERS ARE STATE WORKERS AT

00:55:15.779 --> 00:55:18.615 region:rollup2
EDIE DEAR DIEM V. THEY ARE

00:55:17.114 --> 00:55:21.051 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED. RIGHT OUR

00:55:18.615 --> 00:55:22.586 region:rollup2
JOB AS SOCIAL SERVICE WORKERS IN

00:55:21.051 --> 00:55:24.021 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SERVICE WORKERS ARTIST

00:55:22.586 --> 00:55:26.623 region:rollup2
SERVICE THE CLIENT IT'S

00:55:24.021 --> 00:55:29.126 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY CONTRARY TO A PUBLIC.

00:55:26.623 --> 00:55:30.227 region:rollup2
MISSION OF PROFIT SAVINGS ARE

00:55:29.126 --> 00:55:31.929 region:rollup2
TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO SAVE

00:55:30.227 --> 00:55:34.464 region:rollup2
MONEY IT'S IT COMPLETELY GOES

00:55:31.929 --> 00:55:35.732 region:rollup2
CONTRADICTORY TO THAT AND I

00:55:34.464 --> 00:55:37.034 region:rollup2
THINK OUR GOAL AS FRONTLINE

00:55:35.732 --> 00:55:38.502 region:rollup2
WORKERS ON YOUR BEHALF IS TO

00:55:37.034 --> 00:55:40.404 region:rollup2
HELP THE CLIENTS. DELIVER

00:55:38.502 --> 00:55:41.805 region:rollup2
SERVICES AND PROTECT

00:55:40.404 --> 00:55:43.273 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS IN THEIR MOST

00:55:41.805 --> 00:55:44.741 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE STATE OF MIND IF YOU

00:55:43.273 --> 00:55:47.578 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT OUR SAFETY NET

00:55:44.741 --> 00:55:49.446 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS IT'S A SAFETY NET IT'S

00:55:47.578 --> 00:55:51.381 region:rollup2
THE NET THAT'S GONNA CATCH

00:55:49.446 --> 00:55:53.317 region:rollup2
PEOPLE AND THE MOST VULNERABLE

00:55:51.381 --> 00:55:55.919 region:rollup2
TIMES. IN THE RULES VULNERABLE

00:55:53.317 --> 00:55:57.187 region:rollup2
TIMES OF NEED WE HAVE TO ENSURE

00:55:55.919 --> 00:55:58.922 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE DON'T FOLLOW THOSE

00:55:57.187 --> 00:56:01.692 region:rollup2
CRACKS. HAVING A SYSTEM THAT IS

00:55:58.922 --> 00:56:02.292 region:rollup2
PUT IN PLACE ONLY TO SAVE MONEY

00:56:01.692 --> 00:56:03.427 region:rollup2
IS.

00:56:02.292 --> 00:56:04.361 region:rollup2
BY FAR GONNA HAVE MORE CRACKS IN

00:56:03.427 --> 00:56:05.095 region:rollup2
IT THAN A HUMAN BEING CAN HAVE

00:56:04.361 --> 00:56:05.762 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES ARE GONNA COME AND

00:56:05.095 --> 00:56:06.730 region:rollup2
SAY WE WANT TO INNOVATE WE WANT

00:56:05.762 --> 00:56:07.831 region:rollup2
TO STREAMLINE AND OUR MINDS

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:09.700 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE WAYS. TO TAKE AWAY

00:56:07.831 --> 00:56:10.801 region:rollup2
JOBS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR

00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:12.636 region:rollup2
WORKERS THAT YOU GUYS HAVE THAT

00:56:10.801 --> 00:56:14.137 region:rollup2
ARE ON THE FRONT LINES EVERY

00:56:12.636 --> 00:56:16.006 region:rollup2
SINGLE DAY TO DO THIS WORK.

00:56:14.137 --> 00:56:17.107 region:rollup2
I AM I THINK THAT IF WE I TALK

00:56:16.006 --> 00:56:18.575 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

00:56:17.107 --> 00:56:20.377 region:rollup2
AUTOMATION HAPPENS WITHOUT THE

00:56:18.575 --> 00:56:21.311 region:rollup2
WORKERS INPUT. WE LOSE WORKERS

00:56:20.377 --> 00:56:23.247 region:rollup2
ON THE FRONT LINES THOSE ARE

00:56:21.311 --> 00:56:25.282 region:rollup2
GOOD PAYING JOBS THAT WORKERS

00:56:23.247 --> 00:56:26.717 region:rollup2
LOSE OFTENTIMES ALL SAME WORKERS

00:56:25.282 --> 00:56:28.218 region:rollup2
ARE IN THE SAME LINES OF THE

00:56:26.717 --> 00:56:29.753 region:rollup2
SAME PEOPLE THEY ARE PROTECTING.

00:56:28.218 --> 00:56:31.388 region:rollup2
BECAUSE NOW THEY'RE OUT OF A JOB

00:56:29.753 --> 00:56:33.690 region:rollup2
AND THEY NEED SERVICES FROM OUR

00:56:31.388 --> 00:56:35.726 region:rollup2
SAFETY NET BENEFITS TRAINING IS

00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:37.194 region:rollup2
ESSENTIAL. WORKERS HAVE TO KNOW

00:56:35.726 --> 00:56:38.896 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY'RE EXPECTED TO DO HOW

00:56:37.194 --> 00:56:39.897 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEMS WORK A LOT OF THE

00:56:38.896 --> 00:56:41.131 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT ROLLED OUT A MEDI

00:56:39.897 --> 00:56:42.266 region:rollup2
CAL HAPPENED WITHOUT WORKERS

00:56:41.131 --> 00:56:44.067 region:rollup2
BEING TRAINED AND SO WORKERS

00:56:42.266 --> 00:56:45.502 region:rollup2
THAT KNOW. HOW TO ANSWER A LOT

00:56:44.067 --> 00:56:46.770 region:rollup2
OF THE QUESTIONS ONCE THEY

00:56:45.502 --> 00:56:47.905 region:rollup2
ROLLED OUT?

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:49.606 region:rollup2
IF WE ACTUALLY LOOK AT WHAT

00:56:47.905 --> 00:56:51.441 region:rollup2
HAPPENS WHEN IT WOULD INNOVATION

00:56:49.606 --> 00:56:53.010 region:rollup2
OR A COST SAVINGS MEASURES ARE

00:56:51.441 --> 00:56:54.344 region:rollup2
PUT IN PLACE FOR AUTOMATION THAT

00:56:53.010 --> 00:56:55.946 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GOES CONTRARY TO THE

00:56:54.344 --> 00:56:57.414 region:rollup2
ULTIMATE GOAL. AND A LOT OF THE

00:56:55.946 --> 00:56:58.982 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS WERE AUTOMATION WAS PUT

00:56:57.414 --> 00:57:01.184 region:rollup2
FORWARD IN THE STATE CHILD

00:56:58.982 --> 00:57:03.620 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THE COURT SYSTEMS THE M.

00:57:01.184 --> 00:57:05.555 region:rollup2
V. ET DE LA CALLE HERE'S PROJECT

00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:06.957 region:rollup2
I CAN GO ON FOR EVER. THEY ENDED

00:57:05.555 --> 00:57:07.958 region:rollup2
UP COSTING THE STATE MORE MONEY

00:57:06.957 --> 00:57:09.293 region:rollup2
THAN THEY WOULD HAVE COST IF WE

00:57:07.958 --> 00:57:11.161 region:rollup2
WOULD JUST INVESTED IN FRONTLINE

00:57:09.293 --> 00:57:12.696 region:rollup2
WORKERS BECAUSE PROCUREMENT HAS

00:57:11.161 --> 00:57:14.131 region:rollup2
TO HAPPEN. THE SYSTEMS DON'T

00:57:12.696 --> 00:57:15.565 region:rollup2
WORK CLIENTS COME TO THE TABLE

00:57:14.131 --> 00:57:17.067 region:rollup2
AND SAY I'M NOT GETTING MY

00:57:15.565 --> 00:57:18.535 region:rollup2
BENEFITS ON TIME AND YOU HAVE A

00:57:17.067 --> 00:57:19.503 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LAWSUIT FACING YOU

00:57:18.535 --> 00:57:21.271 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE HAVE A CERTAIN TIME

00:57:19.503 --> 00:57:22.339 region:rollup2
LIMIT. TO DELIVER A TO PEOPLE

00:57:21.271 --> 00:57:23.607 region:rollup2
THAT WE CARE ABOUT.

00:57:22.339 --> 00:57:24.841 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY ISN'T THAT NEW

00:57:23.607 --> 00:57:25.943 region:rollup2
AUTOMATION IN THE WORLD OF

00:57:24.841 --> 00:57:27.411 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SERVICES ISN'T

00:57:25.943 --> 00:57:29.313 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY A NEW THING THAT

00:57:27.411 --> 00:57:29.947 region:rollup2
WE'VE EXPERIENCE IT'S SOMETHING

00:57:29.313 --> 00:57:31.715 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE ENGAGED IN

00:57:29.947 --> 00:57:32.950 region:rollup2
WHOLEHEARTEDLY AND THE TIME THAT

00:57:31.715 --> 00:57:33.717 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL HAS BEEN

00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:35.352 region:rollup2
WHEN THE WORKERS ARE ON THE

00:57:33.717 --> 00:57:35.986 region:rollup2
FRONTLINE. WHEN THE WORKERS ARE

00:57:35.352 --> 00:57:36.787 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY TELLING THEIR

00:57:35.986 --> 00:57:38.355 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE THAT I HEARD MY

00:57:36.787 --> 00:57:39.623 region:rollup2
BROTHER'S TALK ABOUT TWO IN THE

00:57:38.355 --> 00:57:40.957 region:rollup2
PRIVATE SECTOR CAN TELL THEIR

00:57:39.623 --> 00:57:42.959 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE OF WHAT'S EFFECTIVE

00:57:40.957 --> 00:57:45.095 region:rollup2
AND WHAT'S NOT EFFECTIVE ABSENT

00:57:42.959 --> 00:57:46.530 region:rollup2
THAT. THE GOAL IS NOT INNOVATION

00:57:45.095 --> 00:57:48.365 region:rollup2
THE GOAL AGAIN GOES BACK TO THE

00:57:46.530 --> 00:57:50.100 region:rollup2
PROFIT SAVINGS AND THE COST

00:57:48.365 --> 00:57:51.468 region:rollup2
SAVINGS THAT AGAIN IS COMPLETELY

00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:53.370 region:rollup2
CONTRARY TO THE DELIVERY OF

00:57:51.468 --> 00:57:54.471 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SECTOR SERVICES. FOR OUR

00:57:53.370 --> 00:57:56.506 region:rollup2
SAFETY NET IN MOST VULNERABLE

00:57:54.471 --> 00:57:58.575 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS. I THINK IF YOU ASK

00:57:56.506 --> 00:58:00.010 region:rollup2
WHAT THE STATE CAN DO TO MAKE

00:57:58.575 --> 00:58:01.378 region:rollup2
SURE THAT WE CONTROLLED

00:58:00.010 --> 00:58:03.347 region:rollup2
AUTOMATION AND THE IDEA OF

00:58:01.378 --> 00:58:04.581 region:rollup2
INNOVATION ON OUR PUBLIC SECTOR

00:58:03.347 --> 00:58:06.316 region:rollup2
SERVICES IN OUR SAFETY NET

00:58:04.581 --> 00:58:08.085 region:rollup2
BENEFITS IS AGAIN. I HATE TO BE

00:58:06.316 --> 00:58:09.252 region:rollup2
REDUNDANT WORKERS HAVE TO LEAD

00:58:08.085 --> 00:58:12.155 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO BE ON THE FRONT LINES

00:58:09.252 --> 00:58:12.556 region:rollup2
OF THE DISCUSSION WE KNOW FIRST

00:58:12.155 --> 00:58:13.957 region:rollup2
HAND HOW TO MAKE.

00:58:12.556 --> 00:58:15.425 region:rollup2
APPLYING FOR SERVICES MORE

00:58:13.957 --> 00:58:17.394 region:rollup2
CONVENIENT FOR WORK FOR CLIENTS

00:58:15.425 --> 00:58:19.262 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WERE THERE AND WE SEE IT

00:58:17.394 --> 00:58:20.997 region:rollup2
A CAN BE BASED ON AN ALGORITHM

00:58:19.262 --> 00:58:23.433 region:rollup2
ARE A SYSTEM THAT IS INTENDED

00:58:20.997 --> 00:58:25.402 region:rollup2
ONLY TO SAVE COSTS THAT'S NOT

00:58:23.433 --> 00:58:27.170 region:rollup2
INNOVATION THAT AGAIN. IT'S ALL

00:58:25.402 --> 00:58:29.039 region:rollup2
AS ALL I PIVOTED AT A COST

00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:30.674 region:rollup2
SAVINGS AND OF COST SAVINGS IS

00:58:29.039 --> 00:58:31.908 region:rollup2
THE MOTIVATION THAT WE HAVE TO

00:58:30.674 --> 00:58:33.577 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT THERE'S GONNA BE

00:58:31.908 --> 00:58:34.478 region:rollup2
IMPACTS TO PUBLIC SERVICES.

00:58:33.577 --> 00:58:36.713 region:rollup2
CLIENTS ARE GONNA FALL THROUGH

00:58:34.478 --> 00:58:37.414 region:rollup2
THE CRACKS BECAUSE THE GOAL IN

00:58:36.713 --> 00:58:38.715 region:rollup2
COST SAVINGS.

00:58:37.414 --> 00:58:39.449 region:rollup2
THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN ACHIEVE IT

00:58:38.715 --> 00:58:41.151 region:rollup2
IS BY GIVING CLIENTS LESS

00:58:39.449 --> 00:58:42.686 region:rollup2
BENEFITS.

00:58:41.151 --> 00:58:43.887 region:rollup2
THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE IS TO

00:58:42.686 --> 00:58:45.322 region:rollup2
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF WORKERS

00:58:43.887 --> 00:58:46.523 region:rollup2
THAT ARE ON THE FRONT LINES.

00:58:45.322 --> 00:58:48.325 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IN BOTH OF THOSE

00:58:46.523 --> 00:58:49.993 region:rollup2
INSTANCES YOU GUYS WERE HERE HOW

00:58:48.325 --> 00:58:51.561 region:rollup2
CONTRADICTORY IDEAS TO THE GOAL

00:58:49.993 --> 00:58:52.662 region:rollup2
OF PUBLIC SERVICE WE WANT TO

00:58:51.561 --> 00:58:53.930 region:rollup2
CATCH EVERYBODY BEFORE THEY FALL

00:58:52.662 --> 00:58:55.332 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE CRACKS. WE WANT TO

00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:56.867 region:rollup2
TRY TO PROVIDE SELF SUFFICIENCY

00:58:55.332 --> 00:58:59.136 region:rollup2
IN EVERY WAY THAT WE CAN THERE

00:58:56.867 --> 00:59:00.604 region:rollup2
IS NO ALGORITHM THAT CAN TELL US

00:58:59.136 --> 00:59:02.072 region:rollup2
A PERSON THAT CAME IN FOR CAL

00:59:00.604 --> 00:59:04.007 region:rollup2
FRESH ACTUALLY NEED HOUSING.

00:59:02.072 --> 00:59:05.008 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO ALGORITHM THAT CAN

00:59:04.007 --> 00:59:06.376 region:rollup2
TELL US SOMEBODY THAT CAME IN

00:59:05.008 --> 00:59:08.011 region:rollup2
FOR HOUSING ACTUALLY MIGHT NEED

00:59:06.376 --> 00:59:09.513 region:rollup2
A MEDI CAL CARD. THAT'S

00:59:08.011 --> 00:59:10.514 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT HUMAN BEINGS SEE

00:59:09.513 --> 00:59:11.782 region:rollup2
THAT SOMETHING THAT WE SEE

00:59:10.514 --> 00:59:13.383 region:rollup2
THROUGH OUR DIALOGUE THAT OUR

00:59:11.782 --> 00:59:14.484 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM THERE IS

00:59:13.383 --> 00:59:16.520 region:rollup2
A REALITY THAT THERE ARE THOSE

00:59:14.484 --> 00:59:17.788 region:rollup2
WHO MEET THE HAPPY PATH THAT YOU

00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:19.089 region:rollup2
PROBABLY HEAR ABOUT A LOT IN

00:59:17.788 --> 00:59:20.190 region:rollup2
YOUR. SUB COMMITTEES AND YOU

00:59:19.089 --> 00:59:21.892 region:rollup2
HEAR ABOUT A LOT AS WELL THERE'S

00:59:20.190 --> 00:59:22.492 region:rollup2
SOME INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA

00:59:21.892 --> 00:59:24.828 region:rollup2
THEY CAN GO THROUGH AN

00:59:22.492 --> 00:59:26.396 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY PROCESS OR PROCESS.

00:59:24.828 --> 00:59:28.064 region:rollup2
TO THEIR PHONE ARE DOING ON MY

00:59:26.396 --> 00:59:30.033 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THAT IS HAPPY THERE'S NO

00:59:28.064 --> 00:59:31.301 region:rollup2
HICCUPS IS VERY RARE AND IT'S

00:59:30.033 --> 00:59:32.836 region:rollup2
NOT COMMON AND SO IN THOSE

00:59:31.301 --> 00:59:34.638 region:rollup2
INSTANCES THEY HAVE TO REACH OUT

00:59:32.836 --> 00:59:36.139 region:rollup2
TO WORKER THEY HAVE TO CONTACT A

00:59:34.638 --> 00:59:37.841 region:rollup2
WORKER. IN OF THE WORKER ISN'T

00:59:36.139 --> 00:59:39.543 region:rollup2
FAMILIAR AND LEADING THE

00:59:37.841 --> 00:59:41.545 region:rollup2
ALGORITHM IN THE SYSTEMS THAT

00:59:39.543 --> 00:59:42.546 region:rollup2
THE CLIENT JUST WENT THROUGH WE

00:59:41.545 --> 00:59:44.147 region:rollup2
HAVE TO TELL A WORKER I CAN'T

00:59:42.546 --> 00:59:45.515 region:rollup2
HELP YOU. OUR CLIENT I'M SORRY

00:59:44.147 --> 00:59:47.484 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN HELP YOU AND THAT'S

00:59:45.515 --> 00:59:49.086 region:rollup2
NOT SOMETHING THAT IS IS IS EASY

00:59:47.484 --> 00:59:50.554 region:rollup2
FOR A CLIENT TO ACCEPT WHEN

00:59:49.086 --> 00:59:52.289 region:rollup2
THEY'RE IN THEIR MOST VULNERABLE

00:59:50.554 --> 00:59:53.824 region:rollup2
STATE AND THEY'RE SEEKING HELP

00:59:52.289 --> 00:59:55.392 region:rollup2
AND THE MOST VULNERABLE STATE OF

00:59:53.824 --> 00:59:58.095 region:rollup2
MIND. SO I WOULD SAY THERE'S

00:59:55.392 --> 01:00:00.030 region:rollup2
ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO AS AS

00:59:58.095 --> 01:00:02.232 region:rollup2
THE ELECTED OFFICIALS AT US ON

01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:04.201 region:rollup2
THE LABOR SIDE IS WORK TOGETHER

01:00:02.232 --> 01:00:05.535 region:rollup2
WHEN AUTOMATION COMES ESPECIALLY

01:00:04.201 --> 01:00:08.472 region:rollup2
IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. AND

01:00:05.535 --> 01:00:10.807 region:rollup2
SECONDLY BE ABLE TO CALL A DUCK

01:00:08.472 --> 01:00:13.376 region:rollup2
A DUCK IF THERE IS A GOOD HAVE

01:00:10.807 --> 01:00:15.212 region:rollup2
THERE'S A GOAL OF COST SAVINGS

01:00:13.376 --> 01:00:17.414 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE IMPACT AND AT WHAT

01:00:15.212 --> 01:00:19.516 region:rollup2
COST. NOT ONLY FROM THE WORKERS

01:00:17.414 --> 01:00:21.518 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE AND PUBLIC SECTOR

01:00:19.516 --> 01:00:22.953 region:rollup2
WORKERS LOSING THEIR JOB BUT

01:00:21.518 --> 01:00:25.188 region:rollup2
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE

01:00:22.953 --> 01:00:26.423 region:rollup2
CLIENT THAT WANTED TO COME IN

01:00:25.188 --> 01:00:29.192 region:rollup2
AND RECEIVE HORIZONTAL

01:00:26.423 --> 01:00:32.062 region:rollup2
INTEGRATION OF SERVICES THAT YOU

01:00:29.192 --> 01:00:35.098 region:rollup2
GUYS ARE VERY AWARE OF AS WELL.

01:00:32.062 --> 01:00:36.733 region:rollup2
AND ONLY RECEIVE ONE SERVICE

01:00:35.098 --> 01:00:39.936 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY WENT THEY WENT

01:00:36.733 --> 01:00:42.405 region:rollup2
ONLINE SYSTEM I THINK SEIU IS

01:00:39.936 --> 01:00:44.074 region:rollup2
FULLY COMMITTED TO TRYING TO

01:00:42.405 --> 01:00:46.142 region:rollup2
INNOVATE AND TRYING TO MAKE

01:00:44.074 --> 01:00:48.411 region:rollup2
THINGS EASIER FOR CLIENTS BUT

01:00:46.142 --> 01:00:50.413 region:rollup2
NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE

01:00:48.411 --> 01:00:55.085 region:rollup2
SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. AND

01:00:50.413 --> 01:00:56.253 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF

01:00:55.085 --> 01:01:01.291 region:rollup2
GOOD PUBLIC SECTOR JOBS.

01:00:56.253 --> 01:01:03.326 region:rollup2
OF THANK YOU SO MUCH AND.

01:01:01.291 --> 01:01:04.427 region:rollup2
NOTE STATE THEY HAVE TO

01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:06.162 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAVE A MIXED RECORD

01:01:04.427 --> 01:01:08.164 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY WE'VE HAD SEVERAL

01:01:06.162 --> 01:01:09.733 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL IT PROJECTS ATTENDED

01:01:08.164 --> 01:01:11.902 region:rollup2
YOUR LOSS ABOUT THOSE IN THE

01:01:09.733 --> 01:01:13.370 region:rollup2
NEWS AND WE'VE HAD SEVERAL THAT

01:01:11.902 --> 01:01:14.337 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL IN.

01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:15.438 region:rollup2
I'VE ALWAYS MARK THAT THE.

01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:17.407 region:rollup2
ONES IN WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN

01:01:15.438 --> 01:01:19.176 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL IS OFTEN ARE THE ONES

01:01:17.407 --> 01:01:20.477 region:rollup2
WHERE THE VENDOR COMES IN AND

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:21.811 region:rollup2
SAYS I HAVE A SOLUTION AND

01:01:20.477 --> 01:01:23.547 region:rollup2
DOESN'T TALK TO THE PEOPLE

01:01:21.811 --> 01:01:26.116 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DOING THE WORK.

01:01:23.547 --> 01:01:28.051 region:rollup2
AND THEY HAVE IN THEIR MINDS

01:01:26.116 --> 01:01:29.386 region:rollup2
SOME. SOMETHING THEY IMAGINED

01:01:28.051 --> 01:01:30.086 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK

01:01:29.386 --> 01:01:30.987 region:rollup2
IN THE NEXT TALK PEOPLE DOING

01:01:30.086 --> 01:01:33.456 region:rollup2
THE WORK AND THEN THEY WONDER

01:01:30.987 --> 01:01:35.292 region:rollup2
WHY SYSTEM DOESN'T WORK VERY

01:01:33.456 --> 01:01:37.227 region:rollup2
WELL. AND THAT WHY EVERYONE'S

01:01:35.292 --> 01:01:38.028 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATED WITH IT SO.

01:01:37.227 --> 01:01:39.062 region:rollup2
.

01:01:38.028 --> 01:01:41.431 region:rollup2
SO CERTAINLY I THINK THAT

01:01:39.062 --> 01:01:42.766 region:rollup2
THAT'S. WHEN WE LOOK AT. HOW WE

01:01:41.431 --> 01:01:46.570 region:rollup2
AUTOMATE IT ELEVATES?

01:01:42.766 --> 01:01:48.138 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT ASPECT.

01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:51.274 region:rollup2
BUT IT IT YOU THINK THE OTHER

01:01:48.138 --> 01:01:52.309 region:rollup2
PIECE THOUGH IS THAT I'D LIKE TO

01:01:51.274 --> 01:01:54.077 region:rollup2
ASK YOU ABOUT IS.

01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:54.578 region:rollup2
IT IS IT WAS BROUGHT UP IS THAT.

01:01:54.077 --> 01:01:54.945 region:rollup2
.

01:01:54.578 --> 01:01:57.047 region:rollup2
THE IDEA THAT.

01:01:54.945 --> 01:01:59.583 region:rollup2
.

01:01:57.047 --> 01:02:01.518 region:rollup2
THAT ACTUALLY.

01:01:59.583 --> 01:02:04.988 region:rollup2
INNOVATION AUTOMATION CARE AND

01:02:01.518 --> 01:02:04.988 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY IMPROVES THE.

01:02:05.055 --> 01:02:09.259 region:rollup2
THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THE WORKER

01:02:07.524 --> 01:02:11.194 region:rollup2
THERE'S AN ADVANTAGE THERE.

01:02:09.259 --> 01:02:12.796 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE IS A PART ABOUT

01:02:11.194 --> 01:02:14.698 region:rollup2
THAT IMPROVE PROGRAM FACT WE'VE

01:02:12.796 --> 01:02:15.198 region:rollup2
SEEN OVER TIME THAT. WE'VE HAD

01:02:14.698 --> 01:02:17.167 region:rollup2
INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY BY

01:02:15.198 --> 01:02:19.035 region:rollup2
WORKERS.

01:02:17.167 --> 01:02:20.837 region:rollup2
SOME DO THAT AUTOMATION SOME

01:02:19.035 --> 01:02:22.205 region:rollup2
DUE TO OTHER FACTORS OVER THE

01:02:20.837 --> 01:02:24.274 region:rollup2
PAST COUPLE DECADES.

01:02:22.205 --> 01:02:26.109 region:rollup2
BUT THE ACTUAL REWARDS OF THAT

01:02:24.274 --> 01:02:28.278 region:rollup2
INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY HAS NOT

01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:28.812 region:rollup2
BEEN SHARED WITH THE WORKER IT'S

01:02:28.278 --> 01:02:30.280 region:rollup2
GOT OFF TO WALLSTREET OR

01:02:28.812 --> 01:02:32.582 region:rollup2
WHEREVER ELSE.

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:34.351 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO AS WERE

01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:36.620 region:rollup2
WORKING ON.

01:02:34.351 --> 01:02:38.455 region:rollup2
IMPROVING PRODUCTIVITY TO BE

01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:39.623 region:rollup2
ENSURING THAT.

01:02:38.455 --> 01:02:41.157 region:rollup2
THE WORKERS ACTUALLY GET A FAIR

01:02:39.623 --> 01:02:43.059 region:rollup2
SHARE OF THE PRODUCTIVITY

01:02:41.157 --> 01:02:45.428 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS THAT DATA RESULTING

01:02:43.059 --> 01:02:47.564 region:rollup2
AND HOW TO ENSURE THAT THAT

01:02:45.428 --> 01:02:48.665 region:rollup2
HAPPENS IS WERE MOVING AHEAD

01:02:47.564 --> 01:02:51.801 region:rollup2
WITH. WITH THE.

01:02:48.665 --> 01:02:54.738 region:rollup2
INNOVATION AUTOMATION LIKE

01:02:51.801 --> 01:02:56.006 region:rollup2
EVERYONE ELSE CALL IT'S.

01:02:54.738 --> 01:02:57.340 region:rollup2
SO PERHAPS WE CAN.

01:02:56.006 --> 01:02:58.608 region:rollup2
TOUCH A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT YOU

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:59.976 region:rollup2
SEE IS AS YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S

01:02:58.608 --> 01:03:01.378 region:rollup2
PRIVATE SECTOR PUBLIC SECTOR

01:02:59.976 --> 01:03:03.680 region:rollup2
PEOPLE SAY.

01:03:01.378 --> 01:03:06.116 region:rollup2
AND SAY THAT OKAY WE WANT TO END

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:07.517 region:rollup2
OF AB ONE AUTOMATE BECAUSE WE'RE

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:08.718 region:rollup2
GOING TO.

01:03:07.517 --> 01:03:10.086 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE THINK THAT THAT'S

01:03:08.718 --> 01:03:11.488 region:rollup2
ALLOW YEAR.

01:03:10.086 --> 01:03:12.989 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF THE WORKERS TO BE

01:03:11.488 --> 01:03:14.257 region:rollup2
ABLE TO DO A LITTLE MORE THAN

01:03:12.989 --> 01:03:16.259 region:rollup2
THEY WERE ABLE TO DO BEFORE

01:03:14.257 --> 01:03:17.627 region:rollup2
MAYBE DO MORE EASILY ETCETERA.

01:03:16.259 --> 01:03:19.496 region:rollup2
.

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:21.264 region:rollup2
HOW THE CONVERSATIONS GO ABOUT

01:03:19.496 --> 01:03:24.000 region:rollup2
OKAY GREAT NOW YOU GET TO WE

01:03:21.264 --> 01:03:24.601 region:rollup2
WERE DOING A LITTLE LAWYER AND?

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.735 region:rollup2
PROBABLY HOPEFULLY YOU MAKE A

01:03:24.601 --> 01:03:28.138 region:rollup2
LOT MORE MONEY AND WHAT PART OF

01:03:25.735 --> 01:03:32.175 region:rollup2
IT'S COMING BACK TO THE PERSON

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:33.376 region:rollup2
IS ACTUALLY DOING THE WORK.

01:03:32.175 --> 01:03:34.411 region:rollup2
BEGIN WITH. SO I I THINK IN

01:03:33.376 --> 01:03:36.479 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SERVICES THERE'S A NUMBER

01:03:34.411 --> 01:03:36.946 region:rollup2
OF EXAMPLES WHERE AUTOMATION HAS

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:38.648 region:rollup2
WORKED AND HELPED OUR

01:03:36.946 --> 01:03:40.950 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVITY. THAT FOR EXAMPLE

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:42.218 region:rollup2
IN CAL WORKS WE USED TO REQUIRE

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:44.120 region:rollup2
PAGE AT STEPS TO BE BROUGHT INTO

01:03:42.218 --> 01:03:45.355 region:rollup2
THE OFFICE WEEZER REQUIRE THEIR

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:47.023 region:rollup2
WHOLE BANKING STATEMENT TO BE

01:03:45.355 --> 01:03:48.692 region:rollup2
BROUGHT INTO THE OFFICE. THAT

01:03:47.023 --> 01:03:50.794 region:rollup2
CAN BE ELECTRONICALLY SCANNED

01:03:48.692 --> 01:03:51.961 region:rollup2
AND SENT TO A WORKER RIGHT SO IT

01:03:50.794 --> 01:03:53.930 region:rollup2
DOESN'T REQUIRE THE WORKER TO

01:03:51.961 --> 01:03:55.031 region:rollup2
LEAVE HER DESK AND GO TO THE

01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:56.766 region:rollup2
LOBBY COLLECT INFORMATION PUT IT

01:03:55.031 --> 01:03:58.768 region:rollup2
IN A HARD FILE. THOSE THINGS DO

01:03:56.766 --> 01:03:59.803 region:rollup2
IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY BUT ALL OF

01:03:58.768 --> 01:04:01.805 region:rollup2
THOSE THINGS IN THERE'S A NUMBER

01:03:59.803 --> 01:04:03.173 region:rollup2
OF EXAMPLES LIKE THAT WERE DONE

01:04:01.805 --> 01:04:04.407 region:rollup2
WITH THE WORKER INPUT SO IT GOES

01:04:03.173 --> 01:04:05.475 region:rollup2
BACK TO I THINK WHERE WE STARTED

01:04:04.407 --> 01:04:07.410 region:rollup2
THE CONVERSATION IF THE WORKER

01:04:05.475 --> 01:04:08.745 region:rollup2
IS SITTING DOWN. AND THERE'S A

01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:10.113 region:rollup2
QUESTION HOW DO WE INNOVATE HOW

01:04:08.745 --> 01:04:12.315 region:rollup2
DO WE IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY TO

01:04:10.113 --> 01:04:14.317 region:rollup2
HELP YOU DO YOUR JOB BETTER

01:04:12.315 --> 01:04:15.819 region:rollup2
RIGHT THRE'S A NUMBER OF IDEAS

01:04:14.317 --> 01:04:16.586 region:rollup2
THAT OUR MEMBERS CAN COME UP

01:04:15.819 --> 01:04:17.520 region:rollup2
WITH THAT WE'VE IMPLEMENTED A

01:04:16.586 --> 01:04:18.688 region:rollup2
LOT OF THEM WITH OUR

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:20.890 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIPS WITH YOU IN THE

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:22.192 region:rollup2
COUNTIES AND SUCH. I THINK THAT

01:04:20.890 --> 01:04:24.594 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEMS COME AS WHICH WHICH

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:25.495 region:rollup2
YOU SAID WHEN THEY HAPPEN BEFORE

01:04:24.594 --> 01:04:27.030 region:rollup2
THERE'S ENGAGEMENT WITH THE

01:04:25.495 --> 01:04:28.932 region:rollup2
WORKER WITH AN ANTICIPATION THAT

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:31.101 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS MIGHT HELP. AND

01:04:28.932 --> 01:04:32.502 region:rollup2
REALLY IT ACTUALLY PILES ONTO

01:04:31.101 --> 01:04:35.338 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER AND THE AMOUNT OF

01:04:32.502 --> 01:04:37.140 region:rollup2
WORK THAT WE HAVE TO DO SO HOW I

01:04:35.338 --> 01:04:38.842 region:rollup2
THINK WERE INNOVATIVE WERE

01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:40.009 region:rollup2
TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO SOLVE IT

01:04:38.842 --> 01:04:42.145 region:rollup2
BUT IF A VENDOR IS LEADING THE

01:04:40.009 --> 01:04:44.013 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION AND THE WORKERS ARE

01:04:42.145 --> 01:04:46.282 region:rollup2
ONLY IN THE CONVERSATION YOU'RE

01:04:44.013 --> 01:04:50.153 region:rollup2
STARTING OUT. FROM THE WRONG

01:04:46.282 --> 01:04:53.590 region:rollup2
BLOCK IN YOU KNOW IN WHAT I IS

01:04:50.153 --> 01:04:57.627 region:rollup2
SO AND THE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:57.994 region:rollup2
THE PRIVATE SECTOR THAT THIS TWO

01:04:57.627 --> 01:04:59.162 region:rollup2
PIECES OF THIS.

01:04:57.994 --> 01:04:59.829 region:rollup2
NUMBER ONE IS WE CANNOT ALLOW

01:04:59.162 --> 01:05:00.663 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS TO REROUTE TO REWRITE

01:04:59.829 --> 01:05:01.631 region:rollup2
THE RULES AROUND WHO WHO WHO

01:05:00.663 --> 01:05:02.265 region:rollup2
THEY WORK FOR.

01:05:01.631 --> 01:05:02.932 region:rollup2
RIGHT WE HAVE TO CREATE A EQUAL

01:05:02.265 --> 01:05:04.267 region:rollup2
LEVEL ACCOUNTABILITY ACROSS THE

01:05:02.932 --> 01:05:05.702 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIES TO HAVE REAL FAIR

01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:06.269 region:rollup2
COMPETITION RIGHT BECAUSE OF

01:05:05.702 --> 01:05:06.936 region:rollup2
SOME WORK SO IN OUR WORLD.

01:05:06.269 --> 01:05:07.470 region:rollup2
IF SOME OF THE EMPLOYERS THAT WE

01:05:06.936 --> 01:05:08.671 region:rollup2
REPRESENT ACTUALLY HAVE

01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:10.373 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES AND THEY'RE IN THERE

01:05:08.671 --> 01:05:11.074 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE BOUND BY A SERIES OF

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:11.608 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE LOGGED

01:05:11.074 --> 01:05:12.242 region:rollup2
A ONE THROUGH COLLECTIVE

01:05:11.608 --> 01:05:12.809 region:rollup2
BARGAINING. AND YOU HAVE OTHER

01:05:12.242 --> 01:05:14.277 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS THAT DON'T HAVE

01:05:12.809 --> 01:05:16.646 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES AND SUBCONTRACT OUT

01:05:14.277 --> 01:05:18.081 region:rollup2
THERE WORKING ON IT.

01:05:16.646 --> 01:05:19.449 region:rollup2
UNACCOUNTABLE TO THE SAME LEVELS

01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:20.417 region:rollup2
OF NEW LAW THAT THE THAT THE

01:05:19.449 --> 01:05:21.351 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS WE REPRESENT OUR THAN

01:05:20.417 --> 01:05:22.018 region:rollup2
THAT RIGHT THERE WAS UNFAIR

01:05:21.351 --> 01:05:22.952 region:rollup2
MARKETPLACE UNFAIR COMPETITION.

01:05:22.018 --> 01:05:24.120 region:rollup2
SO I THINK IT'S REALLY ABOUT

01:05:22.952 --> 01:05:24.721 region:rollup2
CREATING A FAIR PLAYING FIELD

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:26.122 region:rollup2
AROUND COMPETITION FOR REALLY

01:05:24.721 --> 01:05:28.224 region:rollup2
GONNA HAVE A TRUE FREE MARKET

01:05:26.122 --> 01:05:29.492 region:rollup2
RIGHT. I WOULD SAY SECONDLY.

01:05:28.224 --> 01:05:30.627 region:rollup2
.

01:05:29.492 --> 01:05:31.194 region:rollup2
YEAH I I LOOK BACK TO THAT IT

01:05:30.627 --> 01:05:32.829 region:rollup2
WAS TWO THOUSAND TEN A TWO

01:05:31.194 --> 01:05:35.265 region:rollup2
THOUSAND ELEVEN WHEN OUR BARACK

01:05:32.829 --> 01:05:37.500 region:rollup2
OBAMA GOTTEN REALLY CRITICIZED

01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:39.102 region:rollup2
HE SAID YOU DIDN'T BUILD THAT.

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:41.504 region:rollup2
RIGHT YOU KNOW HE CAME THAT

01:05:39.102 --> 01:05:42.238 region:rollup2
VISALIA RALLY IN IT WAS THE SAME

01:05:41.504 --> 01:05:44.407 region:rollup2
THAT YOU CAN BILL THAT WHAT HE

01:05:42.238 --> 01:05:47.210 region:rollup2
WAS. NO WE ALL BELOW KNOWN

01:05:44.407 --> 01:05:47.410 region:rollup2
BELIEVES. HIS ACTIONS ARE ABOUT

01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:48.711 region:rollup2
HOW.

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:49.646 region:rollup2
NO COMPANY EXISTS AN ISLAND NO

01:05:48.711 --> 01:05:50.680 region:rollup2
INNOVATION HAPPENS WITHOUT THE

01:05:49.646 --> 01:05:52.215 region:rollup2
SUPPORT OF AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:54.083 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY ABOUT HOW DO WE USE

01:05:52.215 --> 01:05:55.385 region:rollup2
THAT LEVERAGE IN THIS TRANSITION

01:05:54.083 --> 01:05:56.853 region:rollup2
TO SAY YOU'RE GONNA BE A COMBO

01:05:55.385 --> 01:05:58.321 region:rollup2
OF WE INVEST DOLLARS IN PUBLIC

01:05:56.853 --> 01:05:59.689 region:rollup2
EDUCATION. WHEN WE INVEST

01:05:58.321 --> 01:06:00.757 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN SORT OF WORKFORCE

01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:02.392 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS THAT YOU

01:06:00.757 --> 01:06:03.660 region:rollup2
COMPANY ARE BENEFITING FROM THAT

01:06:02.392 --> 01:06:04.627 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE WE HAVE TO HAVE A

01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:05.829 region:rollup2
COMMITMENT BACK FROM YOU. THAT

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:07.263 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T OF REINVEST THAT YOUR

01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:08.498 region:rollup2
WORK FORCE RIGHT AND I THINK

01:06:07.263 --> 01:06:09.632 region:rollup2
THERE'S WAYS TO DO THAT. YOU

01:06:08.498 --> 01:06:11.835 region:rollup2
KNOW WE HAVE APPRENTICESHIP

01:06:09.632 --> 01:06:13.136 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS WE HAVE WORKFORCE

01:06:11.835 --> 01:06:14.871 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT BOARD DOLLARS WE HAVE

01:06:13.136 --> 01:06:17.106 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW A SERIES OF DIFFERENT

01:06:14.871 --> 01:06:17.640 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE HAVE TRINITY COLLEGE

01:06:17.106 --> 01:06:17.941 region:rollup2
WITH A SERIES OF DIFFERENT

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.476 region:rollup2
THINGS AS.

01:06:17.941 --> 01:06:20.577 region:rollup2
AS EMPLOYES ARE GOING ON HIRING

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:22.278 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THEY'RE GETTING THE

01:06:20.577 --> 01:06:23.746 region:rollup2
BENEFIT OF THIS EDUCATIONAL

01:06:22.278 --> 01:06:25.248 region:rollup2
SYSTEM I THINK IS A TIME TO

01:06:23.746 --> 01:06:27.383 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT HOW WE RESTRUCTURE.

01:06:25.248 --> 01:06:28.852 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THESE CONCEPTS AROUND

01:06:27.383 --> 01:06:30.353 region:rollup2
JOB RETRAINING IN JUST YOU KNOW

01:06:28.852 --> 01:06:32.188 region:rollup2
JOB BECAUSE HE'S IN A WAY THAT

01:06:30.353 --> 01:06:33.756 region:rollup2
CREATES A LEVERAGE POINT. FOR

01:06:32.188 --> 01:06:34.891 region:rollup2
WORKERS IN A LEVERAGE POINT FOR

01:06:33.756 --> 01:06:37.527 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE STATE AND I THINK

01:06:34.891 --> 01:06:38.027 region:rollup2
THOSE THINGS TO DO AND GET AND

01:06:37.527 --> 01:06:38.895 region:rollup2
AND REALLY BUILD A TRUE

01:06:38.027 --> 01:06:39.529 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP.

01:06:38.895 --> 01:06:42.532 region:rollup2
TO BE IN BUSINESS AND LABOR AND

01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:43.933 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

01:06:42.532 --> 01:06:46.703 region:rollup2
I'M A TEAMSTER SO I WON'T PULL

01:06:43.933 --> 01:06:48.838 region:rollup2
ANY PUNCHES.

01:06:46.703 --> 01:06:50.173 region:rollup2
EVERY EMPLOYER THAT WE'VE DEALT

01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:52.542 region:rollup2
WITH THAT'S DOING THIS

01:06:50.173 --> 01:06:55.278 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY. TOM PAUL OF OUR

01:06:52.542 --> 01:06:57.547 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE WITH SILICON VALLEY.

01:06:55.278 --> 01:06:59.482 region:rollup2
IS THAT EVERYBODY'S VERY NERVOUS

01:06:57.547 --> 01:07:02.418 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN TERMS

01:06:59.482 --> 01:07:04.254 region:rollup2
OF REGULATION.

01:07:02.418 --> 01:07:06.289 region:rollup2
WE STILL LIVE IN A DAY AND AGE

01:07:04.254 --> 01:07:06.789 region:rollup2
WHERE LABOR HAS CONSIDERABLE

01:07:06.289 --> 01:07:09.359 region:rollup2
POLITICAL POWER IN THIS

01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:10.660 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:11.995 region:rollup2
AND AT THE LEVEL OF LOCAL

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:14.430 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

01:07:11.995 --> 01:07:15.965 region:rollup2
AND WE WORK VERY HARD TO MAKE

01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:18.601 region:rollup2
THAT A REALITY.

01:07:15.965 --> 01:07:19.936 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE SOME EMPLOYERS WHO I

01:07:18.601 --> 01:07:21.804 region:rollup2
WOULD.

01:07:19.936 --> 01:07:23.006 region:rollup2
SAY ARE ENLIGHTENED ENOUGH TO

01:07:21.804 --> 01:07:24.741 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE.

01:07:23.006 --> 01:07:28.344 region:rollup2
THAT.

NO MATTER WHAT COST SAVING GETS

01:10:16.479 --> 01:10:23.720 region:rollup2
CREATED THERE CERTAIN THINGS

01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:25.021 region:rollup2
ABOUT HAVING.

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:26.155 region:rollup2
THE WORK FORCE THAT CANNOT BE.

01:10:25.021 --> 01:10:28.191 region:rollup2
CANNOT REPLACE AND THAT NO

01:10:26.155 --> 01:10:29.959 region:rollup2
COMPANY OR ORGANIZATION IS WHAT

01:10:28.191 --> 01:10:30.993 region:rollup2
IT IS WITHOUT ITS WORK FORCE AND

01:10:29.959 --> 01:10:32.028 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU'VE. YOU'VE CERTAINLY

01:10:30.993 --> 01:10:33.162 region:rollup2
DONE YOUR MEMBERS.

01:10:32.028 --> 01:10:35.031 region:rollup2
EXTREME JUSTICE IN GETTING THAT

01:10:33.162 --> 01:10:37.100 region:rollup2
ACROSS.

01:10:35.031 --> 01:10:37.867 region:rollup2
YEAH I WON ACTUAL COUPLE

01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:39.302 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT BE

01:10:37.867 --> 01:10:42.205 region:rollup2
PROVOCATIVE THOUGH BECAUSE IT

01:10:39.302 --> 01:10:44.640 region:rollup2
SEEMS TO ME. THAT WE ARE IN THIS

01:10:42.205 --> 01:10:46.509 region:rollup2
WE ARE WHERE WE ARE MOMENT. AND

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:47.176 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THESE COMPANIES ARE

01:10:46.509 --> 01:10:48.578 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD WITH CERTAIN

01:10:47.176 --> 01:10:50.446 region:rollup2
THINGS AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT

01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:52.215 region:rollup2
THEY DO. HAVE AT THE HEART OF

01:10:50.446 --> 01:10:55.118 region:rollup2
THEM PROFIT MAKING EXPENSE

01:10:52.215 --> 01:10:58.955 region:rollup2
SAVING AND. DIRECTLY THE LOSS OF

01:10:55.118 --> 01:10:58.955 region:rollup2
JOBS UNLESS THERE IS SOME

01:10:59.021 --> 01:11:02.291 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT AND.

01:11:00.490 --> 01:11:03.226 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ONE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE

01:11:02.291 --> 01:11:04.794 region:rollup2

FLETCHER. AND I 䀡ITE

01:11:06.395 --> 01:11:09.132 region:rollup2
WHENEVER SHE'S READY IF SHE

01:11:07.797 --> 01:11:11.501 region:rollup2
WANTS TO MAKE SOME REMARKS BUT

01:11:09.132 --> 01:11:13.102 region:rollup2
ARE WE ARE WE AT SOME. AYE

01:11:11.501 --> 01:11:15.238 region:rollup2
INEVITABLE PLACE INEVITABLE

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:16.539 region:rollup2
CONFLICT WHERE COMPANIES WANT TO

01:11:15.238 --> 01:11:18.040 region:rollup2
MAKE PROFIT THAT'S WHAT THEY DO.

01:11:16.539 --> 01:11:20.443 region:rollup2
AS THEY WANT TO SAVE MONEY

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:22.311 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO AND THAT WE

01:11:20.443 --> 01:11:23.713 region:rollup2
ARE AT AN UNAVOIDABLE CONFLICT

01:11:22.311 --> 01:11:25.948 region:rollup2
THAT IS CURRENTLY PITTING.

01:11:23.713 --> 01:11:30.953 region:rollup2
THAT INTERESTS WITH THE

01:11:25.948 --> 01:11:33.122 region:rollup2
LIKELIHOOD OF JOBS BEING LOST AS

01:11:30.953 --> 01:11:35.625 region:rollup2
A RESULT ARE WE THERE.

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:37.293 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:11:35.625 --> 01:11:39.061 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THEY CAN COEXIST.

01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:40.496 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THERE IS A REALITY

01:11:39.061 --> 01:11:42.231 region:rollup2
THAT IN AND I THINK WE'VE SEEN

01:11:40.496 --> 01:11:44.467 region:rollup2
THIS IN PUBLIC SERVICES WHERE

01:11:42.231 --> 01:11:46.469 region:rollup2
YOU COULD FIND EFFICIENCIES AND

01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:48.204 region:rollup2
PROTECT JOBS AT THE SAME TIME. I

01:11:46.469 --> 01:11:50.873 region:rollup2
THINK WHEN THE GOAL STARTS OFF

01:11:48.204 --> 01:11:52.141 region:rollup2
WITH ONE ONLY ONE IN MIND WHICH

01:11:50.873 --> 01:11:54.143 region:rollup2
IS COST SAVINGS THAT ONE IS

01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:55.378 region:rollup2
GONNA FALL WITH IT AND THE SAME

01:11:54.143 --> 01:11:57.446 region:rollup2
TO THE CONTRARY IF IF THE GOAL

01:11:55.378 --> 01:11:58.514 region:rollup2
IN MIND IS ONLY TO SAVE WORKERS

01:11:57.446 --> 01:11:59.582 region:rollup2
AND YOU'RE NOT REALLY LOOKING AT

01:11:58.514 --> 01:12:01.851 region:rollup2
INNOVATION. THEN YOU DON'T

01:11:59.582 --> 01:12:03.553 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE BOTH GOALS I'VE SEEN IN

01:12:01.851 --> 01:12:04.620 region:rollup2
THE MEDI CAL OPERATION WE'VE

01:12:03.553 --> 01:12:06.222 region:rollup2
WE'VE ALLOWED ONLINE

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:07.890 region:rollup2
APPLICATIONS BUT WE CREATED A NO

01:12:06.222 --> 01:12:08.991 region:rollup2
WRONG DOOR POLICY THAT'S WHAT WE

01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:10.760 region:rollup2
WE NAMED IT IN THAT'S WHAT WE

01:12:08.991 --> 01:12:12.328 region:rollup2
WANT. YOU CAN GO THROUGH ANY

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:14.163 region:rollup2
DOOR YOU WANT TO TO RECEIVE

01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:15.531 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY FOR PROGRAMS YOU CAN

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:17.266 region:rollup2
GO TALK TO SOMEONE IN PERSON YOU

01:12:15.531 --> 01:12:18.534 region:rollup2
CAN APPLY ON YOUR SMARTPHONE YOU

01:12:17.266 --> 01:12:20.069 region:rollup2
CAN APPLY FOR PRESUMPTIVE

01:12:18.534 --> 01:12:21.804 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY AT A HOSPITAL. YOU

01:12:20.069 --> 01:12:23.372 region:rollup2
CAN GO TO A NAVIGATOR AND APPLY

01:12:21.804 --> 01:12:25.241 region:rollup2
FOR ELIGIBILITY BUT THERE'S

01:12:23.372 --> 01:12:26.709 region:rollup2
ALWAYS A NEED FOR WORKER. SO FOR

01:12:25.241 --> 01:12:28.644 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE IN MEDI CAL WHAT WE DID

01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:30.446 region:rollup2
IS NO ONE CAN DETERMINE YOUR

01:12:28.644 --> 01:12:31.480 region:rollup2
HERE IT FIXED ELIGIBILITY AND

01:12:30.446 --> 01:12:33.482 region:rollup2
LESS IT'S A HUMAN BEING

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:34.283 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY WORKER. THE SYSTEM

01:12:33.482 --> 01:12:35.451 region:rollup2
CAN TELL YOU THAT THEY THINK

01:12:34.283 --> 01:12:37.019 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE ELIGIBLE BASED ON

01:12:35.451 --> 01:12:38.588 region:rollup2
THE INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE BUT

01:12:37.019 --> 01:12:40.122 region:rollup2
A WORKER A HUMAN BEING IS WHO

01:12:38.588 --> 01:12:41.424 region:rollup2
YOU GUYS HAVE ENTRUSTED TO

01:12:40.122 --> 01:12:42.091 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DETERMINE IF THEY

01:12:41.424 --> 01:12:43.960 region:rollup2
RECEIVE STATE AND FEDERAL

01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:46.062 region:rollup2
BENEFITS. AND SO I THINK THERE'S

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:47.430 region:rollup2
A WAY THAT YOU CAN DO BOTH AND

01:12:46.062 --> 01:12:50.066 region:rollup2
IF IF IF THE GOAL IN MIND A

01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:51.467 region:rollup2
GUINNESS TO INNOVATE. AND.

01:12:50.066 --> 01:12:53.502 region:rollup2
HONOR THE WORKERS THAT YOU HAVE

01:12:51.467 --> 01:12:55.504 region:rollup2
AND AND AND REALIZE THAT THEY'RE

01:12:53.502 --> 01:12:57.039 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO ANY INFRASTRUCTURE

01:12:55.504 --> 01:12:58.474 region:rollup2
THEN THERE IS A WAY THAT THAT

01:12:57.039 --> 01:12:59.909 region:rollup2
CAN THAT CAN CO EXIST. THE

01:12:58.474 --> 01:13:01.444 region:rollup2
REALITY IS THERE MIGHT BE SOME

01:12:59.909 --> 01:13:02.445 region:rollup2
CHANGES IN AND JOB ASSIGNMENTS

01:13:01.444 --> 01:13:04.113 region:rollup2
THERE MIGHT BE WORKERS THAT YOU

01:13:02.445 --> 01:13:05.181 region:rollup2
TRANSITION TO SOMETHING THAT

01:13:04.113 --> 01:13:07.049 region:rollup2
ENHANCES THEIR EXPERIENCE

01:13:05.181 --> 01:13:07.683 region:rollup2
THROUGH AN ONLINE APPLICATION.

01:13:07.049 --> 01:13:08.818 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY HAVE

01:13:07.683 --> 01:13:10.686 region:rollup2
THE SAME JOB OR MAYBE EVEN THE

01:13:08.818 --> 01:13:11.754 region:rollup2
SAME CLASSIFICATION BUT I THINK

01:13:10.686 --> 01:13:13.456 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS A WAY THAT WE CAN

01:13:11.754 --> 01:13:14.891 region:rollup2
UTILIZE A WORKFORCE THAT WE HAVE

01:13:13.456 --> 01:13:16.259 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR.

01:13:14.891 --> 01:13:17.727 region:rollup2
WHAT TRYING TO BE INNOVATIVE

01:13:16.259 --> 01:13:19.362 region:rollup2
AND GIVE CLIENTS THE ABILITY TO

01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:20.930 region:rollup2
APPLY FOR SERVICES IN A MORE

01:13:19.362 --> 01:13:22.198 region:rollup2
CONVENIENT WAY AS A BLACK ON THE

01:13:20.930 --> 01:13:23.633 region:rollup2
SAME QUESTION AND COULD I ASK

01:13:22.198 --> 01:13:24.200 region:rollup2
YOU TO THINK BACK TO YOUR

01:13:23.633 --> 01:13:25.968 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THAT YOU GAVE ABOUT?

01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:27.536 region:rollup2
THE.

01:13:25.968 --> 01:13:28.804 region:rollup2
.

01:13:27.536 --> 01:13:30.139 region:rollup2
THE DELIVERY ROBOTS AND I

01:13:28.804 --> 01:13:31.374 region:rollup2
THOUGHT WHEN YOU SAID THAT IT

01:13:30.139 --> 01:13:32.742 region:rollup2
THAT MAKES THE JOB SAFER FOR

01:13:31.374 --> 01:13:34.243 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES AT THE AYE THAT'S A

01:13:32.742 --> 01:13:35.912 region:rollup2
GREAT THING I THOUGHT OKAY WE

01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:38.447 region:rollup2
CAN USE A AYE TO CREATE SAFETY

01:13:35.912 --> 01:13:39.782 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S A REALLY GOOD GOAL.

01:13:38.447 --> 01:13:41.884 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE IDEA OF.

01:13:39.782 --> 01:13:43.452 region:rollup2
HILL SAW DRIVING CARS.

01:13:41.884 --> 01:13:45.454 region:rollup2
AND AND THEY SAID THAT SOFT

01:13:43.452 --> 01:13:47.223 region:rollup2
DRIVING CARS WILL MAKE THE ROAD

01:13:45.454 --> 01:13:47.823 region:rollup2
SAFER FOR ALL OF US AND I DON'T

01:13:47.223 --> 01:13:49.825 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT WE JUST LOOK AT MY

01:13:47.823 --> 01:13:50.626 region:rollup2
DRIVING RECORD WHEN THEY CAME UP

01:13:49.825 --> 01:13:52.995 region:rollup2
WITH THIS BUT.

01:13:50.626 --> 01:13:54.530 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS NOBLE TO SAY THAT YES

01:13:52.995 --> 01:13:56.332 region:rollup2
YOU CAN CREATE A SCENARIO WHERE

01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:57.800 region:rollup2
THERE FEWER ACCIDENTS.

01:13:56.332 --> 01:13:59.535 region:rollup2
BUT ISN'T THERE AS A RESULT OF

01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:01.237 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:13:59.535 --> 01:14:03.572 region:rollup2
THE CONSEQUENCE THAT THERE WILL

01:14:01.237 --> 01:14:04.940 region:rollup2
BE FEWER PEOPLE TO DRIVE

01:14:03.572 --> 01:14:06.409 region:rollup2
VEHICLES AND THAT WILL BE JOB

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:08.244 region:rollup2
LOSS.

01:14:06.409 --> 01:14:10.012 region:rollup2
YEAH WELL SO LET'S THINK ABOUT

01:14:08.244 --> 01:14:11.847 region:rollup2
THIS FOR MEDICS THEM BE BACK

01:14:10.012 --> 01:14:13.549 region:rollup2
HERE ON THURSDAY TO MEET WITH

01:14:11.847 --> 01:14:14.817 region:rollup2
THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT

01:14:13.549 --> 01:14:17.687 region:rollup2
OF MOTOR VEHICLES.

01:14:14.817 --> 01:14:19.288 region:rollup2
WHO ARE DEVELOPING REGULATIONS

01:14:17.687 --> 01:14:20.756 region:rollup2
FOR SELF DRIVING TRUCKS THEY

01:14:19.288 --> 01:14:22.325 region:rollup2
JUST RELEASED?

01:14:20.756 --> 01:14:24.093 region:rollup2
THERE REGULATIONS FOR SELF

01:14:22.325 --> 01:14:24.994 region:rollup2
DRIVING CARS.

01:14:24.093 --> 01:14:27.296 region:rollup2
IT SHOULD BE ON THE ROADS OF

01:14:24.994 --> 01:14:28.764 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA NEXT MONTH AND I'M

01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:30.967 region:rollup2
SURE MANY OF YOU HEARD THAT

01:14:28.764 --> 01:14:33.336 region:rollup2
YESTERDAY A SELF DRIVING CAR

01:14:30.967 --> 01:14:36.205 region:rollup2
UBER CAR KILLED SOMEBODY.

01:14:33.336 --> 01:14:38.874 region:rollup2
IN ARIZONA.

01:14:36.205 --> 01:14:39.976 region:rollup2
I AM CONVINCED NOW FROM TALKING

01:14:38.874 --> 01:14:42.511 region:rollup2
TO SOME OF THE COMPANIES THAT

01:14:39.976 --> 01:14:43.379 region:rollup2
ARE DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGY AROUND

01:14:42.511 --> 01:14:44.814 region:rollup2
THESE TRUCKS THAT.

01:14:43.379 --> 01:14:46.749 region:rollup2
.

01:14:44.814 --> 01:14:48.918 region:rollup2
WE'RE ON THE CUSP.

01:14:46.749 --> 01:14:50.686 region:rollup2
WE COULD GO THAT DIRECTION.

01:14:48.918 --> 01:14:51.721 region:rollup2
WHERE?

01:14:50.686 --> 01:14:53.322 region:rollup2
THE NEW TRUCKS THAT ARE BEING

01:14:51.721 --> 01:14:55.691 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED.

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:57.660 region:rollup2
COULD. REALIZE SIGNIFICANT FUEL

01:14:55.691 --> 01:14:59.362 region:rollup2
SAVINGS

01:14:57.660 --> 01:15:00.963 region:rollup2
FOR THE COMPANIES SO THEY WOULD

01:14:59.362 --> 01:15:03.265 region:rollup2
SAVE MONEY.

01:15:00.963 --> 01:15:05.301 region:rollup2
WHERE IT COULD MAKE OUR MEMBERS

01:15:03.265 --> 01:15:07.470 region:rollup2
JOB SAFER BECAUSE THEY WOULD

01:15:05.301 --> 01:15:09.238 region:rollup2
HAVE THINGS LIKE DRIVERS CYSTIC

01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:10.773 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY THAT PROTECT THEM

01:15:09.238 --> 01:15:12.208 region:rollup2
THAT STOPPED THE TRUCK IN THE

01:15:10.773 --> 01:15:13.876 region:rollup2
EVENT OF ACCIDENTS AND I'VE

01:15:12.208 --> 01:15:16.078 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY? STOOD IN FRONT OF

01:15:13.876 --> 01:15:20.716 region:rollup2
DRIVERLESS BUSES AS A TEST WITH

01:15:16.078 --> 01:15:25.054 region:rollup2
ONE OF OUR EMPLOYERS TRANSDEV.

01:15:20.716 --> 01:15:26.555 region:rollup2
I'M STILL HERE SO.

01:15:25.054 --> 01:15:28.424 region:rollup2
AT ME WITH HER CROWD HELP ME I'M

01:15:26.555 --> 01:15:28.991 region:rollup2
STILL HERE. YOU KNOW.

01:15:28.424 --> 01:15:29.792 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE MY WIFE DIDN'T KNOW

01:15:28.991 --> 01:15:32.228 region:rollup2
THE.

01:15:29.792 --> 01:15:33.829 region:rollup2
THE THE TECHNOLOGY IS ACTUALLY

01:15:32.228 --> 01:15:35.431 region:rollup2
THERE THE COULD HELP.

01:15:33.829 --> 01:15:37.099 region:rollup2
THESE TRUCKS ARE REALLY

01:15:35.431 --> 01:15:39.135 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE PIECES

01:15:37.099 --> 01:15:40.903 region:rollup2
OF MACHINERY.

01:15:39.135 --> 01:15:42.838 region:rollup2
THEY REQUIRE SKILLS THAT ARE

01:15:40.903 --> 01:15:43.639 region:rollup2
MEMBERS WHO DRIVE FOR UPS AND

01:15:42.838 --> 01:15:46.609 region:rollup2
OTHER COMPANIES DON'T CURRENTLY

01:15:43.639 --> 01:15:47.043 region:rollup2
HAVE.

01:15:46.609 --> 01:15:48.344 region:rollup2
TALKING TO SOME THE

01:15:47.043 --> 01:15:50.046 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURER'S I ACTUALLY

01:15:48.344 --> 01:15:51.647 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT IF OUR MEMBERS IF

01:15:50.046 --> 01:15:53.315 region:rollup2
WE WORKED WITH THEM TO TRAIN OUR

01:15:51.647 --> 01:15:55.718 region:rollup2
MEMBERS UP TO HAVE THE SKILLS TO

01:15:53.315 --> 01:15:56.919 region:rollup2
DRIVE THIS EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT.

01:15:55.718 --> 01:15:59.021 region:rollup2
THAT THEY IN TURN WOULD HAVE

01:15:56.919 --> 01:16:01.624 region:rollup2
MORE EARNING POWER AND MORE

01:15:59.021 --> 01:16:03.359 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVE SAY FOR JOBS AND THE

01:16:01.624 --> 01:16:05.561 region:rollup2
COMPANIES THAT ARE MOVING GOODS

01:16:03.359 --> 01:16:08.130 region:rollup2
WOULD REALIZE COST SAVINGS IN

01:16:05.561 --> 01:16:10.266 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS. THAT'S A WIN WIN

01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:12.635 region:rollup2
FORMULA.

01:16:10.266 --> 01:16:15.371 region:rollup2
BUT IF THE D. M. V.. ROLLS OUT

01:16:12.635 --> 01:16:19.308 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS. BUT JUST LETS THESE

01:16:15.371 --> 01:16:21.610 region:rollup2
COMPANIES DO WHATEVER THEY WANT

01:16:19.308 --> 01:16:23.546 region:rollup2
WITH LITTLETON CHEN OR

01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:24.880 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES.

01:16:23.546 --> 01:16:26.615 region:rollup2
THEN THAT'S THE LOSE LOSE

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:27.883 region:rollup2
SCENARIO FOR EVERYBODY EXCEPT

01:16:26.615 --> 01:16:29.885 region:rollup2
FOR THE COMPANIES THAT ARE

01:16:27.883 --> 01:16:32.421 region:rollup2
LOOKING TO MAXIMIZE THEIR

01:16:29.885 --> 01:16:34.290 region:rollup2
PROFITS AND SAVE COSTS AT THE

01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:37.660 region:rollup2
EXPENSE OF WORKERS LIKE MY

01:16:34.290 --> 01:16:39.195 region:rollup2
SISTER HERE WAS TALKING ABOUT.

01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:41.497 region:rollup2
SO I IF I WOULD SAY.

01:16:39.195 --> 01:16:43.199 region:rollup2
I'M A I'M A FIRM BELIEVER IN

01:16:41.497 --> 01:16:45.367 region:rollup2
THE QUOTE THAT THE ARCHITECT

01:16:43.199 --> 01:16:46.502 region:rollup2
HISTORY BENDS TOWARDS JUSTICE.

01:16:45.367 --> 01:16:48.170 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S OUR ROLE TO BEND THAT

01:16:46.502 --> 01:16:49.839 region:rollup2
ARC OF HISTORY TOWARDS JUSTICE

01:16:48.170 --> 01:16:51.407 region:rollup2
AND AND I DO THINK WE HAVE REAL

01:16:49.839 --> 01:16:53.109 region:rollup2
CHOICES IN THIS MATTER AND

01:16:51.407 --> 01:16:55.511 region:rollup2
NOTHING IS INEVITABLE. NO THE

01:16:53.109 --> 01:16:56.645 region:rollup2
ACCEPTANCE THAT TECHNOLOGICAL

01:16:55.511 --> 01:16:57.980 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW TECHNOLOGICAL

01:16:56.645 --> 01:16:59.815 region:rollup2
REVOLUTION YOU KNOW THAT IT'S

01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:01.517 region:rollup2
HAPPENING IS INEVITABLE IS ONE

01:16:59.815 --> 01:17:03.119 region:rollup2
THAT I THAT I DON'T BELIEVE IN.

01:17:01.517 --> 01:17:04.587 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THERE'S A REAL WAY

01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:06.522 region:rollup2
TO THINK ABOUT HOW EACH OF US

01:17:04.587 --> 01:17:07.957 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND OUR ROLES IN THAT

01:17:06.522 --> 01:17:09.992 region:rollup2
EQUATION BUSINESS HAS A ROLE.

01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:11.760 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT HAS A ROLE LABOR HAS

01:17:09.992 --> 01:17:12.962 region:rollup2
A ROLE. WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:14.196 region:rollup2
WHAT THAT TRUE PARTNERSHIP LOOKS

01:17:12.962 --> 01:17:16.565 region:rollup2
LIKE IT I THINK YOU KNOW.

01:17:14.196 --> 01:17:18.200 region:rollup2
DOUG JUST GIVE YOU A VERY GOOD

01:17:16.565 --> 01:17:19.869 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE YOU KNOW SUITED TO GIVE

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:21.337 region:rollup2
A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE. IN OUR

01:17:19.869 --> 01:17:22.571 region:rollup2
WORLD.

01:17:21.337 --> 01:17:23.239 region:rollup2
YOU NO IN ESPECIALLY THE RETAIL

01:17:22.571 --> 01:17:24.807 region:rollup2
GROCERY SETTING YOU KNOW THERE'S

01:17:23.239 --> 01:17:26.542 region:rollup2
THIS BIG THING ABOUT AMAZON GO

01:17:24.807 --> 01:17:27.877 region:rollup2
RIGHT YOU DON'T HAVE THESE YOU

01:17:26.542 --> 01:17:29.145 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT HAVE THE STORES ARE NO

01:17:27.877 --> 01:17:30.379 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES AND IT.

01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:31.847 region:rollup2
IT HE WAS GONNA WALK AND TAKE

01:17:30.379 --> 01:17:32.515 region:rollup2
THEIR STUFF IN THE BAG AND THEN

01:17:31.847 --> 01:17:33.816 region:rollup2
LEAVE AND EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE

01:17:32.515 --> 01:17:34.283 region:rollup2
ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT AND YOU KNOW

01:17:33.816 --> 01:17:36.452 region:rollup2
THAT'S CAN BE GREAT.

01:17:34.283 --> 01:17:38.254 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

01:17:36.452 --> 01:17:39.588 region:rollup2
THAT WILL BE A PART OF SOME OF

01:17:38.254 --> 01:17:40.556 region:rollup2
THIS DISCUSSION AND IT'S GONNA

01:17:39.588 --> 01:17:42.391 region:rollup2
BE A PART OF THE YOU KNOW THE

01:17:40.556 --> 01:17:43.859 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC EQUATION BUT WE'VE BEEN

01:17:42.391 --> 01:17:45.995 region:rollup2
TALKING TO EMPLOYERS. AND WHAT

01:17:43.859 --> 01:17:46.595 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS TELL US THE ONES THAT

01:17:45.995 --> 01:17:47.163 region:rollup2
REALLY WANT TO WORK WITH US TO

01:17:46.595 --> 01:17:49.999 region:rollup2
SAID LOOK.

01:17:47.163 --> 01:17:51.700 region:rollup2
WE ACCEPT THAT THE ROLE OF THE

01:17:49.999 --> 01:17:53.135 region:rollup2
WORKER IS GONNA CHANGE AND WE

01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:54.937 region:rollup2
WANT TO WORK WITH YOU TO CHANGE

01:17:53.135 --> 01:17:56.572 region:rollup2
THAT ROLE TOGETHER. RIGHT

01:17:54.937 --> 01:17:58.440 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY

01:17:56.572 --> 01:17:59.708 region:rollup2
WHEN PEOPLE COME INTO THE STORE.

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:00.643 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW EVERYONE

01:17:59.708 --> 01:18:02.011 region:rollup2
HERE GO SHOPPING ON SUNDAY

01:18:00.643 --> 01:18:03.512 region:rollup2
MORNING I MEAN OR WHATEVER DAY I

GO SHOPPING Y. FAMILY THAT'S AN

01:18:03.512 --> 01:18:06.048 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE THAT YOU SHARE WITH

01:18:04.613 --> 01:18:06.849 region:rollup2
YOUR FAMILY. YOU GET TO KNOW

01:18:06.048 --> 01:18:08.651 region:rollup2
YOUR READ SO CLERK YOU TALK

01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:10.152 region:rollup2
ABOUT YOU KNOW WHATEVER PIECE OF

01:18:08.651 --> 01:18:11.620 region:rollup2
FRUIT OR YOU KNOW PIECE OF MEAT

01:18:10.152 --> 01:18:12.454 region:rollup2
THAT YOU HONOR SOME WINE THAT

01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:13.923 region:rollup2
YOU WANT TO TASTE.

01:18:12.454 --> 01:18:15.324 region:rollup2
PEOPLE LIKE THAT ACTUALLY TEND

01:18:13.923 --> 01:18:18.194 region:rollup2
TO BUY MORE THINGS

01:18:15.324 --> 01:18:19.895 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO IT'S ABOUT HOW WE RE

01:18:18.194 --> 01:18:21.530 region:rollup2
READ RETRAIN.

01:18:19.895 --> 01:18:23.032 region:rollup2
THE WORKERS IN THOSE STORES TO

01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:24.667 region:rollup2
TO HELP ADAPT TO THAT

01:18:23.032 --> 01:18:27.002 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE IMPROVING

01:18:24.667 --> 01:18:27.836 region:rollup2
AND IT'S A CHOICE. ITS A CHOICE

01:18:27.002 --> 01:18:29.872 region:rollup2
THAT EMPLOYERS HAVE TO MAKE AND

01:18:27.836 --> 01:18:31.173 region:rollup2
THAT IS ALSO A CHOICE THAT I

01:18:29.872 --> 01:18:33.609 region:rollup2
THINK WE AS A SOCIETY HAVE TO

01:18:31.173 --> 01:18:35.211 region:rollup2
MAKE. IN IN LABOR WHERE YOU KNOW

01:18:33.609 --> 01:18:36.845 region:rollup2
WITH WHAT WE HAVE LEFT

01:18:35.211 --> 01:18:38.380 region:rollup2
AGAIN OUR FIRM ARE PLACE IN THIS

01:18:36.845 --> 01:18:38.914 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION. RIGHT AND I THINK

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:40.282 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GONNA SEE A LOT OF

01:18:38.914 --> 01:18:41.217 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT UNIONS TACKLE THESE

01:18:40.282 --> 01:18:42.318 region:rollup2
ISSUES BUT I THINK IT'S A REAL

01:18:41.217 --> 01:18:43.586 region:rollup2
CHOICE AND I DO THINK WE CAN

01:18:42.318 --> 01:18:45.321 region:rollup2
BEND THAT ARC OF HISTORY TOWARDS

01:18:43.586 --> 01:18:46.388 region:rollup2
JUSTICE. AT READING THROUGH

01:18:45.321 --> 01:18:48.123 region:rollup2
THESE THINGS I THINK IT'S

01:18:46.388 --> 01:18:49.291 region:rollup2
LEGISLATORS AND CONCERN POLICY

01:18:48.123 --> 01:18:50.326 region:rollup2
MAKERS I THINK THERE'S A LOT

01:18:49.291 --> 01:18:51.961 region:rollup2
HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE CAN

01:18:50.326 --> 01:18:54.930 region:rollup2
SHOW AS EXAMPLES FOR US THE

01:18:51.961 --> 01:18:56.699 region:rollup2
COUNTRY.

01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:57.633 region:rollup2
THE ART DOESN'T BEND BY ITSELF

01:18:56.699 --> 01:18:58.667 region:rollup2
TREND DOWN THE STREET WILL STATE

01:18:57.633 --> 01:19:00.035 region:rollup2
AND SOMEONE WHO KNOWS SOMETHING

01:18:58.667 --> 01:19:02.304 region:rollup2
ABOUT THEM IN THE ARE TOWARD

01:19:00.035 --> 01:19:03.872 region:rollup2
SOCIAL JUSTICE. ACTUALLY NEVER

01:19:02.304 --> 01:19:05.140 region:rollup2
GONZALEZ FLETCHER.

01:19:03.872 --> 01:19:05.641 region:rollup2
AND AM I WANNA APOLOGIZE FOR NOT

01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:06.809 region:rollup2
BEING HERE AT TWO OTHER

01:19:05.641 --> 01:19:09.645 region:rollup2
COMMITTEES I WAS SITTING IN THIS

01:19:06.809 --> 01:19:12.147 region:rollup2
MORNING SO. I I DIDN'T GET TO

01:19:09.645 --> 01:19:12.715 region:rollup2
SEE ALL OF THE GREAT TESTIMONIUM

01:19:12.147 --> 01:19:14.350 region:rollup2
SHORE.

01:19:12.715 --> 01:19:15.884 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT I THINK I THINK THIS

01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:18.520 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT DISCUSSION AS ONE WHO

01:19:15.884 --> 01:19:19.655 region:rollup2
HAS. CONSISTENTLY FOUGHT AGAINST

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:21.490 region:rollup2
THIS NOTION THAT.

01:19:19.655 --> 01:19:22.057 region:rollup2
WERE IN A PREDETERMINED COURSE

01:19:21.490 --> 01:19:23.459 region:rollup2
OF

01:19:22.057 --> 01:19:25.261 region:rollup2
OF ACTION IN THIS COUNTRY.

01:19:23.459 --> 01:19:26.729 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS LITTLE ICE

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:28.530 region:rollup2
WATCH THE JETSONS AND WOOD BUT

01:19:26.729 --> 01:19:29.732 region:rollup2
WAS TOLD THAT BY THE TIME I GREW

01:19:28.530 --> 01:19:30.032 region:rollup2
UP THAT'S WHAT WE WOULD BE

01:19:29.732 --> 01:19:31.834 region:rollup2
LIVING AND.

01:19:30.032 --> 01:19:34.169 region:rollup2
.

01:19:31.834 --> 01:19:37.439 region:rollup2
STILL WAITING ON MY. LITTLE

01:19:34.169 --> 01:19:38.007 region:rollup2
TRANSFORMER. SPACESHIP BOMB.

01:19:37.439 --> 01:19:39.975 region:rollup2
SO I THINK A LOT OF A LOT OF

01:19:38.007 --> 01:19:41.810 region:rollup2
THE.

01:19:39.975 --> 01:19:44.079 region:rollup2
TALKS TOWARDS.

01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:46.148 region:rollup2
AUTOMATION WILD SOME THE TALK

01:19:44.079 --> 01:19:48.017 region:rollup2
IS HYPERBOLE AND AND WE HAVE TO

01:19:46.148 --> 01:19:49.785 region:rollup2
ACCEPT THAT AND IT'S USED SO

01:19:48.017 --> 01:19:51.553 region:rollup2
OFTEN. TO.

01:19:49.785 --> 01:19:52.988 region:rollup2
SUPPRESS THE CURRENT WAGES OF

01:19:51.553 --> 01:19:54.156 region:rollup2
WORKERS BOMB YOU KNOW YOU'RE

01:19:52.988 --> 01:19:57.559 region:rollup2
GOING TO LOSE YOUR JOB TO A

01:19:54.156 --> 01:19:58.694 region:rollup2
ROBOT. IF WE DEMAND A REASONABLE

01:19:57.559 --> 01:20:02.331 region:rollup2
WAGE.

01:19:58.694 --> 01:20:03.866 region:rollup2
ITS USE TO TO CHANGE THE NATURE

01:20:02.331 --> 01:20:05.034 region:rollup2
OF EMPLOYEES TEND PET

01:20:03.866 --> 01:20:06.201 region:rollup2
CONTRACTORS IT'S USED

01:20:05.034 --> 01:20:09.004 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY.

01:20:06.201 --> 01:20:10.339 region:rollup2
AT AS A WAY I THINK TO TO PUT

01:20:09.004 --> 01:20:11.840 region:rollup2
DOWN MARKERS.

01:20:10.339 --> 01:20:12.675 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S A CERTAIN SENSE OF

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:14.109 region:rollup2
REALITY WE HAVE TO LIVE WITH

01:20:12.675 --> 01:20:15.044 region:rollup2

01:24:19.087 --> 01:24:21.757 region:rollup2
AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE VERY INVOLVED

01:24:20.656 --> 01:24:23.659 region:rollup2
IN THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING US

01:24:21.757 --> 01:24:25.394 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TOUCH ON

01:24:23.659 --> 01:24:27.062 region:rollup2
THREE POINTS DURING MY TESTIMONY

01:24:25.394 --> 01:24:29.298 region:rollup2
FIRST. I JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE

01:24:27.062 --> 01:24:31.233 region:rollup2
THE OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE

01:24:29.298 --> 01:24:34.336 region:rollup2
IMPACT THAT TECHNOLOGY HAS HAD

01:24:31.233 --> 01:24:35.570 region:rollup2
OVER TIME IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF

01:24:34.336 --> 01:24:36.238 region:rollup2
OUR ECONOMY SECOND.

01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:37.472 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THOSE IMPACTS ARE

01:24:36.238 --> 01:24:38.740 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO PREDICT BEFORE THE

01:24:37.472 --> 01:24:39.541 region:rollup2
FACT AND I WANNA SPEAK ABOUT

01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:41.577 region:rollup2
THAT A LITTLE BIT AND THEN

01:24:39.541 --> 01:24:42.978 region:rollup2
THIRDLY FROM A POLICY INVENTION

01:24:41.577 --> 01:24:44.212 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE. WE'VE HEARD A

01:24:42.978 --> 01:24:45.247 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WORKFORCE BUT I

01:24:44.212 --> 01:24:47.816 region:rollup2
WANT TO DRILL DOWN ON THAT IF

01:24:45.247 --> 01:24:51.420 region:rollup2
THAT'S AN AREA THAT WE SEE. AS

01:24:47.816 --> 01:24:53.322 region:rollup2
AS VERY VERY PROMISING.

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:54.923 region:rollup2
SO FIRST IN GENERAL I REALLY

01:24:53.322 --> 01:24:57.192 region:rollup2
HOPE THAT ONE OF OUR TAKEAWAYS

01:24:54.923 --> 01:24:59.595 region:rollup2
TODAY. IS THAT THE DEPLOYMENT OF

01:24:57.192 --> 01:25:01.263 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY IN THE ECONOMY HAS

01:24:59.595 --> 01:25:03.999 region:rollup2
OVER TIME GENERALLY BEEN

01:25:01.263 --> 01:25:04.933 region:rollup2
OVERWHELMINGLY. POSITIVE.

01:25:03.999 --> 01:25:06.435 region:rollup2
IT'S DRAMATICALLY INCREASE

01:25:04.933 --> 01:25:07.636 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVITY.

01:25:06.435 --> 01:25:10.539 region:rollup2
LEADING TO HIGHER INCOMES

01:25:07.636 --> 01:25:12.240 region:rollup2
GREATER DEMAND AND NEW JOBS.

01:25:10.539 --> 01:25:13.609 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA BETWEEN NINETEEN

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:16.678 region:rollup2
EIGHTY SIX AND TWO THOUSAND

01:25:13.609 --> 01:25:16.845 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN MEDIAN WAGES PARA PARDON

01:25:16.678 --> 01:25:19.214 region:rollup2
ME.

01:25:16.845 --> 01:25:20.749 region:rollup2
MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME HAS

01:25:19.214 --> 01:25:22.250 region:rollup2
ALSO INCREASED FROM JUST OVER

01:25:20.749 --> 01:25:23.952 region:rollup2
TWENTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS A

01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:25.287 region:rollup2
YEAR TO OVER SIX

01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:27.289 region:rollup2
SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR.

01:25:25.287 --> 01:25:30.592 region:rollup2
FORCING INCREASE IN THE QUANTITY

01:25:27.289 --> 01:25:32.227 region:rollup2
OF JOBS AS WELL AS THE QUALITY.

01:25:30.592 --> 01:25:33.929 region:rollup2
IT ALSO GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT

01:25:32.227 --> 01:25:35.597 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY TRANSITIONS OF HAVE A

01:25:33.929 --> 01:25:37.132 region:rollup2
DISPROPORTIONATE COST ON CERTAIN

01:25:35.597 --> 01:25:38.800 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIES AND CERTAIN

01:25:37.132 --> 01:25:40.802 region:rollup2
GEOGRAPHIES. WE FEEL IT IS

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:43.405 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY INCUMBENT UPON ALL OF

01:25:40.802 --> 01:25:45.407 region:rollup2
US TO INVEST IN THE PEOPLE WHO

01:25:43.405 --> 01:25:47.142 region:rollup2
ARE EL WHO ARE IMPACTED BY THE

01:25:45.407 --> 01:25:48.944 region:rollup2
STERN BY THESE TRANSITIONS NOT

01:25:47.142 --> 01:25:50.746 region:rollup2
JUST BECAUSE. THE INHERENT

01:25:48.944 --> 01:25:52.114 region:rollup2
DIGNITY OF THOSE PEOPLES AT

01:25:50.746 --> 01:25:53.782 region:rollup2
STAKE FIRST AND FOREMOST BEAT

01:25:52.114 --> 01:25:55.450 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE NEED TO

01:25:53.782 --> 01:25:57.285 region:rollup2
BRING TO BEAR THE ENERGIES OF

01:25:55.450 --> 01:25:59.254 region:rollup2
EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA TO MAKE

01:25:57.285 --> 01:26:01.657 region:rollup2
THE MOST COMPETITIVE. PLACE THAT

01:25:59.254 --> 01:26:04.292 region:rollup2
IT CAN BE.

01:26:01.657 --> 01:26:04.993 region:rollup2
NOW TO LOOK TO THE FUTURE.

01:26:04.292 --> 01:26:06.395 region:rollup2
THE BEST RESEARCH THE PRINT

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:07.362 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEEN DONE REGARDING A AYE

01:26:06.395 --> 01:26:09.264 region:rollup2
AND THE FUTURE OF WORK POSES

01:26:07.362 --> 01:26:11.066 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. BUT RATHER

01:26:09.264 --> 01:26:12.868 region:rollup2
THAN PROVIDING ANSWERS IT LOOKS

01:26:11.066 --> 01:26:14.770 region:rollup2
TWO SCENARIOS.

01:26:12.868 --> 01:26:16.304 region:rollup2
THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S REALLY HARD

01:26:14.770 --> 01:26:18.840 region:rollup2
TO PREDICT THE FUTURE. IT'S

01:26:16.304 --> 01:26:20.976 region:rollup2
REALLY HARD TO PROACTIVELY MAKE

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:22.844 region:rollup2
POLICY AND GET IT RIGHT.

01:26:20.976 --> 01:26:23.745 region:rollup2
SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THE

01:26:22.844 --> 01:26:24.780 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE OF THE TEN MINUTES IT

01:26:23.745 --> 01:26:27.416 region:rollup2
WAS DEPLOYED IN THE NINETEEN

01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:28.283 region:rollup2
EIGHTIES. MANY REASONABLE PEOPLE

01:26:27.416 --> 01:26:30.719 region:rollup2
PERHAPS THE MOST REASONABLE

01:26:28.283 --> 01:26:33.121 region:rollup2
PEOPLE. THOUGHT THAT THE ATM WAS

01:26:30.719 --> 01:26:34.523 region:rollup2
GOING TO DECIMATE THE YEAR

01:26:33.121 --> 01:26:36.124 region:rollup2
FRANKS OF BANK TELLERS.

01:26:34.523 --> 01:26:37.626 region:rollup2
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

01:26:36.124 --> 01:26:39.961 region:rollup2
IN FACT THE NUMBER OF BANK

01:26:37.626 --> 01:26:41.463 region:rollup2
TELLERS INCREASE OVER TIME AS

01:26:39.961 --> 01:26:42.998 region:rollup2
BANKS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:26:41.463 --> 01:26:44.266 region:rollup2
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF BRANCHES

01:26:42.998 --> 01:26:46.802 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE COMMUNITY.

01:26:44.266 --> 01:26:48.804 region:rollup2
AND RATHER THAN GOING TO LOWER

01:26:46.802 --> 01:26:50.906 region:rollup2
QUALITY JOBS IT ENABLED THOSE

01:26:48.804 --> 01:26:52.808 region:rollup2
TELLERS TO ENABLE NEW PRODUCTS

01:26:50.906 --> 01:26:54.209 region:rollup2
AND SERVICES.

01:26:52.808 --> 01:26:57.212 region:rollup2
SO AGAIN WE SAW BOTH COUNTER

01:26:54.209 --> 01:26:59.815 region:rollup2
INTUITIVELY MORE JOBS. AND

01:26:57.212 --> 01:27:00.415 region:rollup2
HIGHER QUALITY JOBS.

01:26:59.815 --> 01:27:01.783 region:rollup2
YEAH WELL YOU MIGHT HEAR LESS

01:27:00.415 --> 01:27:03.552 region:rollup2
OF.

01:27:01.783 --> 01:27:05.187 region:rollup2
ITS IT IN THE RECESSION. MANY OF

01:27:03.552 --> 01:27:06.455 region:rollup2
THOSE RETAIL OUTLETS CLOSED.

01:27:05.187 --> 01:27:08.523 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE OVERALL IMPACT

01:27:06.455 --> 01:27:10.092 region:rollup2
THE ECONOMY SINCE THAT TIME.

01:27:08.523 --> 01:27:12.094 region:rollup2
WE'VE ALSO SEEN MOBILE BANKING

01:27:10.092 --> 01:27:14.696 region:rollup2
COME IN AS A FORCE IN THOSE JOBS

01:27:12.094 --> 01:27:16.164 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T COME BACK.

01:27:14.696 --> 01:27:18.333 region:rollup2
MY POINT HERE IS IT'S VERY

01:27:16.164 --> 01:27:20.869 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO KNOW. HOW A GIVEN

01:27:18.333 --> 01:27:30.145 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO IMPACT

01:27:20.869 --> 01:27:31.580 region:rollup2
THE ECONOMY? AND WHEN.

01:27:30.145 --> 01:27:33.248 region:rollup2
THE GOOD THING FROM OUR VIEW.

01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:34.883 region:rollup2
IS THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT

01:27:33.248 --> 01:27:36.852 region:rollup2
THINGS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:27:34.883 --> 01:27:38.253 region:rollup2
CAN DO. BOTH TO LEVERAGE THE

01:27:36.852 --> 01:27:40.188 region:rollup2
ENORMOUS POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF A

01:27:38.253 --> 01:27:41.757 region:rollup2
AYE. AND TO RALLY AROUND THOSE

01:27:40.188 --> 01:27:42.257 region:rollup2
WHO BEAR THE COSTS

01:27:41.757 --> 01:27:43.458 region:rollup2
IT'S SOMETHING WOULD BE

01:27:42.257 --> 01:27:45.460 region:rollup2
CRITICAL.

01:27:43.458 --> 01:27:47.129 region:rollup2
EVEN IF WE FROZE TODAY'S ECONOMY

01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:49.064 region:rollup2
IN PLACE AS IT IS FOR THE NEXT

01:27:47.129 --> 01:27:50.699 region:rollup2
FIFTY YEARS. AND THAT IS

01:27:49.064 --> 01:27:53.101 region:rollup2
CREATING A NIMBLE WORLD CLASS

01:27:50.699 --> 01:27:54.436 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE.

01:27:53.101 --> 01:27:55.804 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THIS MEAN WELL? THERE'S

01:27:54.436 --> 01:27:57.773 region:rollup2
A LOT OF DETAIL I COULD GO INTO

01:27:55.804 --> 01:27:59.374 region:rollup2
BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST RE

01:27:57.773 --> 01:28:01.309 region:rollup2
SKILLING CONSTANT FEET

01:27:59.374 --> 01:28:02.911 region:rollup2
CONSTANTLY RENEWING SKILLS AND

01:28:01.309 --> 01:28:04.679 region:rollup2
THIS IS FOR EVERYONE AT EVERY

01:28:02.911 --> 01:28:05.981 region:rollup2
POINT ON THE SKILLS SPECTRUM

01:28:04.679 --> 01:28:07.315 region:rollup2
THAT'S FRANKLY FOR ALL OF US IN

01:28:05.981 --> 01:28:09.151 region:rollup2
THIS ROOM. WHO NEED TO

01:28:07.315 --> 01:28:10.452 region:rollup2
CONSTANTLY BE THINKING ABOUT

01:28:09.151 --> 01:28:11.720 region:rollup2
WHERE WILL I BE IN FIVE YEARS?

01:28:10.452 --> 01:28:13.788 region:rollup2
WITH AN ECONOMY THAT'S CHANGING

01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:15.690 region:rollup2
SO QUICKLY WHAT SKILLS DO I NEED

01:28:13.788 --> 01:28:17.259 region:rollup2
TO DEVELOP SUCH THAT IT'S NOT

01:28:15.690 --> 01:28:18.293 region:rollup2
WHEN I LOSE MY JOB THAT SUDDENLY

01:28:17.259 --> 01:28:20.395 region:rollup2
I'M LOOKING AROUND THINKING OH

01:28:18.293 --> 01:28:21.396 region:rollup2
NO I'VE GOT TO RE SKILL. BECAUSE

01:28:20.395 --> 01:28:24.166 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE'VE STRUGGLE TO FIND

01:28:21.396 --> 01:28:25.534 region:rollup2
OUT FIND MODELS THAT WILL WORK.

01:28:24.166 --> 01:28:27.202 region:rollup2
NOW THAT SAID WITH THE SILICON

01:28:25.534 --> 01:28:28.870 region:rollup2
VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP. WE'VE

01:28:27.202 --> 01:28:30.172 region:rollup2
BEEN WORKING WITH OUR COMMUNITY

01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:31.406 region:rollup2
COLLEGES SEVENTEEN IN OUR AREA

01:28:30.172 --> 01:28:32.707 region:rollup2
OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:28:31.406 --> 01:28:35.043 region:rollup2
STUDENTS MATCHING THEM WITH

01:28:32.707 --> 01:28:37.212 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS. TO INFORM CURRICULA

01:28:35.043 --> 01:28:38.780 region:rollup2
AND ALSO TO MATCH THEM WITH

01:28:37.212 --> 01:28:40.048 region:rollup2
INTERNSHIPS AND JOB SHADOWING

01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:41.449 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES AND THE MANY OTHER

01:28:40.048 --> 01:28:43.385 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES CERTAINLY IN THE RE

01:28:41.449 --> 01:28:44.553 region:rollup2
SKILLING OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT

01:28:43.385 --> 01:28:45.754 region:rollup2
HAS TREMENDOUS EXPERIENCE IN

01:28:44.553 --> 01:28:48.156 region:rollup2
APPRENTICESHIPS EMPLOYMENT

01:28:45.754 --> 01:28:50.158 region:rollup2
TRAINING PANELS. TODAY WE HAVE

01:28:48.156 --> 01:28:52.594 region:rollup2
KHANACADEMY AND LINKED IN

01:28:50.158 --> 01:28:54.563 region:rollup2
LEARNING AS TOOLS THAT ARE

01:28:52.594 --> 01:28:56.665 region:rollup2
BROUGHT BETTER ACCESSIBLE

01:28:54.563 --> 01:28:58.200 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LOW COST CANDIDLY WERE

01:28:56.665 --> 01:29:00.368 region:rollup2
STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:02.470 region:rollup2
TO LEVERAGE THOSE TOOLS WELL.

01:29:00.368 --> 01:29:05.473 region:rollup2
BUT THEY ARE PART OF THE MIX AND

01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:06.374 region:rollup2
WE THINK THERE'S A BY A

01:29:05.473 --> 01:29:07.042 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL THERE.

01:29:06.374 --> 01:29:07.576 region:rollup2
THE RAPID CHANGE IN OUR ECONOMY

01:29:07.042 --> 01:29:08.376 region:rollup2
ALSO REINFORCES JUST HOW

01:29:07.576 --> 01:29:09.110 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT IT IS FOR OUR KEY

01:29:08.376 --> 01:29:09.644 region:rollup2
TWELVE SYSTEM PREPARE OUR

01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:10.312 region:rollup2
STUDENTS FOR THE FUTURE.

01:29:09.644 --> 01:29:10.979 region:rollup2
IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT

01:29:10.312 --> 01:29:11.580 region:rollup2
WE EQUIP ALL STUDENTS REGARDLESS

01:29:10.979 --> 01:29:12.681 region:rollup2
OF THEIR ULTIMATE PROFESSIONS

01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:14.749 region:rollup2
WITH SKILLS TO SUCCESSFULLY

01:29:12.681 --> 01:29:15.717 region:rollup2
NAVIGATING CONTRIBUTE. TO OUR

01:29:14.749 --> 01:29:17.986 region:rollup2
ECONOMY AND SOCIETY IN HERE ON

01:29:15.717 --> 01:29:19.187 region:rollup2
THAT BOBAK CONCERNS COMMENT AT

01:29:17.986 --> 01:29:21.189 region:rollup2
THE HEARING SEVERAL WEEKS AGO

01:29:19.187 --> 01:29:22.157 region:rollup2
AND ASSEMBLY PRIVACY. THAT WE

01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:23.925 region:rollup2
ARE CURRENTLY HAVE MORE STUDENTS

01:29:22.157 --> 01:29:25.193 region:rollup2
STUDYING POTTERY IN CALIFORNIA

01:29:23.925 --> 01:29:26.094 region:rollup2
THAN COMPUTER SCIENCE

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:27.662 region:rollup2
WE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO ON

01:29:26.094 --> 01:29:28.530 region:rollup2
THIS FRONT AND IT'S ALSO IT IS

01:29:27.662 --> 01:29:30.065 region:rollup2
ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT THIS

01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:31.266 region:rollup2
STARTS.

01:29:30.065 --> 01:29:33.368 region:rollup2
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING EARLY

01:29:31.266 --> 01:29:34.903 region:rollup2
CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IS ALSO A

01:29:33.368 --> 01:29:37.539 region:rollup2
CRITICAL PIECE ON THE SEVENTH

01:29:34.903 --> 01:29:38.039 region:rollup2
SUM. TO REALIZE THE GREAT

01:29:37.539 --> 01:29:40.942 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL OF BENEFITS.

01:29:38.039 --> 01:29:42.377 region:rollup2
WE'RE STILL.

01:29:40.942 --> 01:29:43.812 region:rollup2
I RESPECT EXACTLY RIGHTS OF THAT

01:29:42.377 --> 01:29:44.279 region:rollup2
CAME FROM THE THE GAP FROM THE

01:29:43.812 --> 01:29:45.447 region:rollup2
INTERNET TECHNOLOGY IN

01:29:44.279 --> 01:29:47.415 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

01:29:45.447 --> 01:29:49.217 region:rollup2
AND INNOVATION FOUNDATION OF

01:29:47.415 --> 01:29:50.485 region:rollup2
WASHINGTON DC BASED A AND TO THE

01:29:49.217 --> 01:29:52.887 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT ROBERT ATKINSON

01:29:50.485 --> 01:29:54.489 region:rollup2
TESTIFIED AT THE ASSEMBLY

01:29:52.887 --> 01:29:58.627 region:rollup2
PRIVACY COMMITTEE HEARING ON

AND NATIONALLY ON THE

01:32:34.215 --> 01:32:38.787 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENTIAL STORY OF ROBOTICS

01:32:36.751 --> 01:32:40.522 region:rollup2
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND THE

01:32:38.787 --> 01:32:42.123 region:rollup2
REVERBERATIONS A MIGHT HAVE ON

01:32:40.522 --> 01:32:43.892 region:rollup2
JOBS IN THE ECONOMY. IT IS

01:32:42.123 --> 01:32:45.627 region:rollup2
UNDENIABLE THAT AUTOMATION AND

01:32:43.892 --> 01:32:46.594 region:rollup2
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WILL

01:32:45.627 --> 01:32:48.563 region:rollup2
BRING ABOUT SUBSTANTIAL

01:32:46.594 --> 01:32:50.432 region:rollup2
INNOVATION TO SEVERAL SECTORS OF

THE ECONOMY.

01:32:50.432 --> 01:32:53.635 region:rollup2
ECONOMISTS ARE HOPEFUL LIKE THAT

01:32:52.434 --> 01:32:55.470 region:rollup2
LIKE THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION

01:32:53.635 --> 01:32:57.439 region:rollup2
IN THIS NEW ERA WILL CREATE AS

01:32:55.470 --> 01:32:59.140 region:rollup2
MANY JOBS AS IT DISPLACES.

01:32:57.439 --> 01:33:00.708 region:rollup2
TODAY A AYE AND MACHINE LEARNING

01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:02.310 region:rollup2
ARE PRIMARILY USED IN INDUSTRY

01:33:00.708 --> 01:33:03.411 region:rollup2
TO AUGMENT HUMANS IN SECTORS

01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:05.380 region:rollup2

LEADERS TO SPEND MORE TIME

01:33:16.157 --> 01:33:19.227 region:rollup2
SHARING THE BENEFITS OF A AYE

01:33:17.625 --> 01:33:20.929 region:rollup2
AND THE WAYS THAT TECHNOLOGY IS

01:33:19.227 --> 01:33:23.031 region:rollup2
MAKING LIFE BETTER TODAY.

01:33:20.929 --> 01:33:24.466 region:rollup2
NETFLIX AND AMAZON USE A AYE TO

01:33:23.031 --> 01:33:25.733 region:rollup2
MAKE BETTER RECOMMENDATIONS.

01:33:24.466 --> 01:33:26.768 region:rollup2
SOON THE SAME TECHNOLOGY WILL BE

01:33:25.733 --> 01:33:28.136 region:rollup2
USED TO IMPROVE ALL OTHER

01:33:26.768 --> 01:33:30.405 region:rollup2
ASPECTS OF DAILY LIFE FROM

EDUCATION. TO CRIME PREVENTION

01:33:30.405 --> 01:33:33.508 region:rollup2
AND AGRICULTURE TO HEALTH CARE.

01:33:32.173 --> 01:33:34.843 region:rollup2
AGAIN IF YOU LOOK AT HUMAN

01:33:33.508 --> 01:33:35.844 region:rollup2
HISTORY ANYTIME THERE'S BEEN

01:33:34.843 --> 01:33:37.779 region:rollup2
SOME MAJOR TECHNOLOGICAL

01:33:35.844 --> 01:33:39.180 region:rollup2
INNOVATION YOU ULTIMATELY HAVE

01:33:37.779 --> 01:33:40.949 region:rollup2
SOME SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN

01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:42.150 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVITY. WHICH THEN CREATES

01:33:40.949 --> 01:33:44.285 region:rollup2
THE NEED FOR A NEW SET OF

01:33:42.150 --> 01:33:45.687 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIES AND JOBS.

01:33:44.285 --> 01:33:47.822 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY IS NEITHER GOOD NOR

01:33:45.687 --> 01:33:49.390 region:rollup2
BAD. IT'S WHAT YOU DO WITH IT

01:33:47.822 --> 01:33:51.426 region:rollup2
THE MAKES THE DIFFERENCE.

01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:52.827 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY CAN SOLVE PROBLEMS

01:33:51.426 --> 01:33:54.362 region:rollup2
STREAMLINED PROCESS WORK FLOWS

01:33:52.827 --> 01:33:56.030 region:rollup2
AND INNOVATIONS CAN CHANGE THE

01:33:54.362 --> 01:33:57.799 region:rollup2
WAY WE LIVE WHICH CONSEQUENCE

01:33:56.030 --> 01:33:59.667 region:rollup2
LOOK CONSEQUENTLY ALLOWS US TO

01:33:57.799 --> 01:34:01.736 region:rollup2
START TO PUT. AND A PIPE PEOPLE

01:33:59.667 --> 01:34:03.471 region:rollup2
TO ISSUES AND PROBLEMS THAT WERE

01:34:01.736 --> 01:34:04.639 region:rollup2
UNIQUELY CAPABLE OF DOING AND

01:34:03.471 --> 01:34:06.074 region:rollup2
SOLVING.

01:34:04.639 --> 01:34:07.976 region:rollup2
THIS NEW REVOLUTION OFFERS

01:34:06.074 --> 01:34:09.344 region:rollup2
BOUNDLESS POSSIBILITIES HOWEVER

01:34:07.976 --> 01:34:11.179 region:rollup2
IT ALSO CREATES A HIGH DEGREE OF

01:34:09.344 --> 01:34:12.780 region:rollup2
DIFFICULTY FOR POLICY MAKERS AND

01:34:11.179 --> 01:34:15.150 region:rollup2
REGULATORS TRYING TO KEEP UP

01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:16.618 region:rollup2
WITH THE RAPID PACE OF CHANGE.

01:34:15.150 --> 01:34:18.219 region:rollup2
IT'S EASIER TO IDENTIFY THE

01:34:16.618 --> 01:34:19.921 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES OR THE INDUSTRIES AND

01:34:18.219 --> 01:34:22.090 region:rollup2
JOB FUNCTIONS THAT WELL OR COULD

01:34:19.921 --> 01:34:23.191 region:rollup2
BE REPLACED OR BETTER SERVED BY

01:34:22.090 --> 01:34:25.126 region:rollup2
INNOVATION INNOVATIVE

01:34:23.191 --> 01:34:26.928 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES AND AUTOMATION. IT

01:34:25.126 --> 01:34:28.163 region:rollup2
IS MUCH HARDER TO IMAGINE THE

01:34:26.928 --> 01:34:29.364 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WILL BE BORN OUT OF

01:34:28.163 --> 01:34:31.166 region:rollup2
THAT INNOVATION AND THE NEW

01:34:29.364 --> 01:34:33.134 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIES AND JOB FUNCTIONS

01:34:31.166 --> 01:34:34.068 region:rollup2
THAT CAN AND WILL EMERGE.

01:34:33.134 --> 01:34:36.171 region:rollup2
TOGETHER WE MUST FOCUS ON THE

01:34:34.068 --> 01:34:37.338 region:rollup2
WORK FORCE.

01:34:36.171 --> 01:34:39.007 region:rollup2
THIS STARTS WITH PRE K. AND K.

WHICH IN MANY CASES AMOUNTS TO

01:35:36.331 --> 01:35:39.467 region:rollup2
SPECIALIZED INSTRUCTION AND

YOU.

01:36:13.735 --> 01:36:18.206 region:rollup2
BUT YOU KNOW I IT COULD WELL

01:36:15.570 --> 01:36:19.574 region:rollup2
EVERY PANEL I THINK WE HEARD

01:36:18.206 --> 01:36:20.441 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS A TENSION.

01:36:19.574 --> 01:36:21.542 region:rollup2
BETWEEN.

01:36:20.441 --> 01:36:23.077 region:rollup2
INNOVATION.

01:36:21.542 --> 01:36:24.412 region:rollup2
.

01:36:23.077 --> 01:36:26.981 region:rollup2
SAFETY.

01:36:24.412 --> 01:36:30.084 region:rollup2
.

01:36:26.981 --> 01:36:32.353 region:rollup2
JOB ATTENTION. AND NEW JOB

01:36:30.084 --> 01:36:33.988 region:rollup2
CREATION AND. IS THERE ANYTHING

01:36:32.353 --> 01:36:35.757 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO

01:36:33.988 --> 01:36:37.458 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE HEARD TODAY.

01:36:35.757 --> 01:36:38.726 region:rollup2
OR ADD ANY NEW THOUGHTS ABOUT

01:36:37.458 --> 01:36:40.561 region:rollup2
THIS TENSION THAT.

01:36:38.726 --> 01:36:41.529 region:rollup2
AS I THINK EVERY SPEAKER HAS

01:36:40.561 --> 01:36:42.630 region:rollup2
SAID WE HAVE TO WRESTLE WITH

01:36:41.529 --> 01:36:44.332 region:rollup2
THIS THAT THIS SHOULD NOT BE AN

01:36:42.630 --> 01:36:45.800 region:rollup2
EITHER OR THING. THIS IS AN

01:36:44.332 --> 01:36:48.369 region:rollup2
INNOVATION AT THE AT THE EXPENSE

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:50.138 region:rollup2
OF JOBS BUT SHOULD BE INNOVATION

01:36:48.369 --> 01:36:52.040 region:rollup2
THAT MAKES JOBS SAY FOR.

01:36:50.138 --> 01:36:53.708 region:rollup2
RESERVE JOBS AND CREATES NEW

01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:54.242 region:rollup2
JOBS ANYTHING THAT YOU ALL ADD

01:36:53.708 --> 01:36:57.712 region:rollup2
TO THE MENU OF WHAT'S BEEN

01:36:54.242 --> 01:36:58.980 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED TODAY.

01:36:57.712 --> 01:37:00.481 region:rollup2
I THINK THE OTHER REASON REPEAT

01:36:58.980 --> 01:37:01.783 region:rollup2
IN A CONSUMER REPORT THAT SUB

01:37:00.481 --> 01:37:04.018 region:rollup2
AND CITED A COUPLE OF TIMES

01:37:01.783 --> 01:37:06.220 region:rollup2
REALLY CAPTURES I THINK A LOT OF

01:37:04.018 --> 01:37:07.155 region:rollup2
THE PROMISE HERE IN CALIFORNIA

01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:08.423 region:rollup2
AND THE WAYS THAT WE MIGHT THINK

01:37:07.155 --> 01:37:09.590 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT. WE CAN SEE THAT IT

01:37:08.423 --> 01:37:11.459 region:rollup2
THAT IN A NUMBER OF SECTORS

01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:13.328 region:rollup2
INCLUDING HEALTH CARE INCLUDING

01:37:11.459 --> 01:37:14.862 region:rollup2
A INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT

01:37:13.328 --> 01:37:16.331 region:rollup2
ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE

01:37:14.862 --> 01:37:17.265 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL SERVICES THEY'RE

01:37:16.331 --> 01:37:19.901 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE A TONE OF

01:37:17.265 --> 01:37:21.502 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES. IN THE COMING TEN

01:37:19.901 --> 01:37:22.970 region:rollup2
TO TWENTY YEARS OR SO I

01:37:21.502 --> 01:37:24.472 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY THINK THAT.

01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:25.873 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE

01:37:24.472 --> 01:37:27.642 region:rollup2
WHERE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ARE

01:37:25.873 --> 01:37:30.011 region:rollup2
LOOK AT OPPORTUNITIES TO INVEST

01:37:27.642 --> 01:37:30.945 region:rollup2
IN THOSE PLACES. AROUND WHAT THE

01:37:30.011 --> 01:37:32.413 region:rollup2
SAME TIME SERVE LOOKING LOOKING

01:37:30.945 --> 01:37:33.781 region:rollup2
THOSE INDUSTRIES WHERE THERE'S

01:37:32.413 --> 01:37:35.483 region:rollup2
GOINGTO BE SOME DISPLACEMENT

01:37:33.781 --> 01:37:37.051 region:rollup2
AND THINKING ABOUT HOW WE

01:37:35.483 --> 01:37:38.553 region:rollup2
PREPARE NOT JUST THE FOLKS WERE

01:37:37.051 --> 01:37:39.487 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY IN THOSE JOBS BUT BUT

01:37:38.553 --> 01:37:41.122 region:rollup2
THEIR CHILDREN ALL OF OUR

01:37:39.487 --> 01:37:43.257 region:rollup2
CHILDREN. TO BE PREPARED FOR THE

01:37:41.122 --> 01:37:43.991 region:rollup2
JOBS ARE GOING TO BE AROUND IN

01:37:43.257 --> 01:37:45.860 region:rollup2
IN TEN YEARS.

01:37:43.991 --> 01:37:47.862 region:rollup2
I JUST MIGHT ALSO ADD ON ONE OF

01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:48.763 region:rollup2
THE THEMES I AGREE THAT THAT

01:37:47.862 --> 01:37:50.064 region:rollup2
THOSE THOSE ARE THE SAME THEMES

01:37:48.763 --> 01:37:51.499 region:rollup2
THAT WE HEARD OUT OF THE

01:37:50.064 --> 01:37:53.801 region:rollup2
AUDIENCE. I'M BUT I THINK IT'S

01:37:51.499 --> 01:37:55.603 region:rollup2
THE ENGAGEMENT WITH WORKERS AND

01:37:53.801 --> 01:37:56.704 region:rollup2
PROVIDING THE SOLUTIONS AS I

01:37:55.603 --> 01:37:59.340 region:rollup2
THINK IT WAS.

01:37:56.704 --> 01:38:01.075 region:rollup2
PERHAPS TIAS IT'S THAT IT'S THE

01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:02.944 region:rollup2
SORT OF INTEGRATION AND THE CO

01:38:01.075 --> 01:38:04.479 region:rollup2
EXISTING OF TECHNOLOGY AND

01:38:02.944 --> 01:38:05.546 region:rollup2
WORKERS I'M NOT JUST BLANKETING

01:38:04.479 --> 01:38:06.681 region:rollup2
A SOLUTION.

01:38:05.546 --> 01:38:08.449 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE THINK IT SHOULD BE

01:38:06.681 --> 01:38:10.918 region:rollup2
SO BUT IT'S BACKUP COLLABORATION

01:38:08.449 --> 01:38:12.754 region:rollup2
THAT WILL PROVIDE EFFICIENCIES.

01:38:10.918 --> 01:38:14.188 region:rollup2
THROUGH TECHNOLOGY BUT YET

01:38:12.754 --> 01:38:15.423 region:rollup2
STILL SUPPORT THE WORK FORCE SO

01:38:14.188 --> 01:38:17.225 region:rollup2
TO ME I THINK THAT'S A COMMON

01:38:15.423 --> 01:38:20.061 region:rollup2
THREAD.

01:38:17.225 --> 01:38:21.396 region:rollup2
THAT SHOULD BE HIGHLIGHTED.

01:38:20.061 --> 01:38:22.830 region:rollup2
WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT IT THAN

01:38:21.396 --> 01:38:24.198 region:rollup2
THAT I'M A I'M A WHAT WE DON'T

01:38:22.830 --> 01:38:25.933 region:rollup2
DO ABOUT A KIND OF PERSON RIGHT

01:38:24.198 --> 01:38:27.935 region:rollup2
I'M I'M LOOKING OUT I SEE I SEE

01:38:25.933 --> 01:38:29.804 region:rollup2
DOUG FROM THE TEAMSTERS ICT IF

01:38:27.935 --> 01:38:30.671 region:rollup2
MESS YEAH YOU GOT SILICON VALLEY

LEADERSHIP GROUP HERE WE ARE

01:38:30.671 --> 01:38:34.709 region:rollup2

GET IT ALL SORTED OUT ALL FAITH

01:38:34.709 --> 01:38:38.279 region:rollup2
I MEAN LIKE THAT I MEAN LIKE IN

01:38:36.077 --> 01:38:41.382 region:rollup2

OUR BY IN A ROOM.

01:38:41.983 --> 01:38:43.351 region:rollup2
AND SORTED OUT IN A WAY THAT'S

01:38:42.650 --> 01:38:44.752 region:rollup2
VERY SPECIFIC TO WHAT WE DO HERE

01:38:43.351 --> 01:38:45.720 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE

01:38:44.752 --> 01:38:47.121 region:rollup2
LEADERS OF LABOR WE HAVE THE

01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:48.089 region:rollup2
LEADERS OF TECHNOLOGY AND

01:38:47.121 --> 01:38:49.724 region:rollup2
BUSINESS HERE.

01:38:48.089 --> 01:38:51.526 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SOME OF THE FINEST

01:38:49.724 --> 01:38:53.661 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS IN ACADEMIA WHO

01:38:51.526 --> 01:38:55.196 region:rollup2
PROVIDED US SOME SOME SOME

01:38:53.661 --> 01:38:56.531 region:rollup2
STORIES AND SOME DATA. ON THE WE

01:38:55.196 --> 01:38:57.431 region:rollup2
GOING TO ABOUT A WEEK AGO AND WE

01:38:56.531 --> 01:38:59.133 region:rollup2
CAN TO TAKE CARE OF THIS RIGHT

01:38:57.431 --> 01:39:00.701 region:rollup2
HERE AND NOW AND SO HOW DO WE

01:38:59.133 --> 01:39:02.336 region:rollup2
MAKE THIS A SPECIFIC THING. THAT

01:39:00.701 --> 01:39:04.505 region:rollup2
WASN'T JUST OUT A HAD A HEARING

01:39:02.336 --> 01:39:05.673 region:rollup2
AND THEN NOTHING HAPPENED BUT WE

01:39:04.505 --> 01:39:06.607 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

01:39:05.673 --> 01:39:08.309 region:rollup2
I MEAN FROM MY VIEW ONE OF THE

01:39:06.607 --> 01:39:09.644 region:rollup2
GREAT THINGS AS IT WERE ᅍING

01:39:08.309 --> 01:39:11.045 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION AT A TIME WHEN IT'S

01:39:09.644 --> 01:39:12.814 region:rollup2
IT'S AN ODD I MET MY STATEMENT

01:39:11.045 --> 01:39:14.415 region:rollup2
TO SIR. BOOK AND IF YOU WOULD AS

01:39:12.814 --> 01:39:15.650 region:rollup2
YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT WE DO ABOUT

01:39:14.415 --> 01:39:17.318 region:rollup2
IT WOULD YOU BOTH TALK ABOUT

01:39:15.650 --> 01:39:18.953 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU'RE PREPARED O DO WHICH

01:39:17.318 --> 01:39:20.354 region:rollup2
IS COMMITTED TO DUKE TO HELP.

01:39:18.953 --> 01:39:22.089 region:rollup2
MAKE THAT HAPPEN YEAH SO

01:39:20.354 --> 01:39:23.157 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY WE WAIT THE LEADERSHIP

01:39:22.089 --> 01:39:24.892 region:rollup2
GROUP HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO

01:39:23.157 --> 01:39:26.561 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FOR A LONG

01:39:24.892 --> 01:39:27.395 region:rollup2
TIME THIS IS WHERE WHAT WITH ALL

01:39:26.561 --> 01:39:29.697 region:rollup2
THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

01:39:27.395 --> 01:39:30.264 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY IN TERMS I MEAN EVEN

01:39:29.697 --> 01:39:31.732 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BUILDING

01:39:30.264 --> 01:39:33.201 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES. DON'T KNOW EXACTLY

01:39:31.732 --> 01:39:34.101 region:rollup2
WHICH ONES ARE GONNA BE

01:39:33.201 --> 01:39:35.236 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL WHICH BUSINESS MODELS

01:39:34.101 --> 01:39:36.270 region:rollup2
ARE GONNA BE SUCCESSFUL HOW

01:39:35.236 --> 01:39:37.605 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GONNA BE DEPLOYED WHAT

01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:39.674 region:rollup2
THE IMPACTS ARE GOING TO BE THIS

01:39:37.605 --> 01:39:41.108 region:rollup2
IS ONE OF THE GREAT CHALLENGES.

01:39:39.674 --> 01:39:42.176 region:rollup2
IT'S THAT UNCERTAINTY NOW

01:39:41.108 --> 01:39:43.878 region:rollup2
BUSINESS LEADERS HAVE TO MAKE

01:39:42.176 --> 01:39:45.913 region:rollup2
DECISIONS IN THAT CONTEXT AS TO

01:39:43.878 --> 01:39:46.614 region:rollup2
POLICYMAKERS SO IN OUR VIEW.

01:39:45.913 --> 01:39:48.249 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR LIVES TO MOST

01:39:46.614 --> 01:39:50.184 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY IS TO TAKE ACTION

01:39:48.249 --> 01:39:53.788 region:rollup2
WHERE AS OTHERS AND ABSOLUTELY

01:39:50.184 --> 01:39:54.422 region:rollup2
CLEAR RETURN TODAY.

01:39:53.788 --> 01:39:55.723 region:rollup2
TWO YEARS FROM NOW FIVE YEARS

01:39:54.422 --> 01:39:57.124 region:rollup2
FROM NOW TEN YEARS FROM NOW AND

01:39:55.723 --> 01:39:58.960 region:rollup2
WHERE WE HAVE I THINK VERY BROAD

01:39:57.124 --> 01:40:01.195 region:rollup2
CONSENSUS AMONG ALL OF THESE

01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:02.763 region:rollup2
FACTORS IS THAT SKILLS

01:40:01.195 --> 01:40:04.799 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT AT EACH POINT.

01:40:02.763 --> 01:40:05.967 region:rollup2
CRADLE TO CAREER IS GOING TO BE

01:40:04.799 --> 01:40:07.268 region:rollup2
CRITICAL AND EQUIP BOTH FOR

01:40:05.967 --> 01:40:08.936 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY FOR COMPANIES IN A

01:40:07.268 --> 01:40:09.904 region:rollup2
QUESTION ABOUT THAT AS FOR

01:40:08.936 --> 01:40:10.905 region:rollup2
WORKERS AS WELL TO TAKE

01:40:09.904 --> 01:40:12.874 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGE OF ALL THE

01:40:10.905 --> 01:40:14.075 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE BELIEVE

01:40:12.874 --> 01:40:15.576 region:rollup2
WILL BE THERE. SO THAT'S GONNA.

01:40:14.075 --> 01:40:17.178 region:rollup2
GO WORK FOR SEEMS TO BE A PLACE

01:40:15.576 --> 01:40:19.146 region:rollup2
WHERE WE CAN REACH CONSENSUS

01:40:17.178 --> 01:40:20.848 region:rollup2
VERY SOON YOUR LEGISLATION I

01:40:19.146 --> 01:40:21.949 region:rollup2
THINK SPEAKS OF THE.

01:40:20.848 --> 01:40:23.517 region:rollup2
SO I DO NOT THINK ABOUT THIS

01:40:21.949 --> 01:40:24.719 region:rollup2
LITTLE MORE SIMPLY WHEN MY FIFTY

01:40:23.517 --> 01:40:26.287 region:rollup2
YEAR OLD DOCTOR GETS REALLY

01:40:24.719 --> 01:40:27.588 region:rollup2
OVERWHELMED WITH CHEMISTRY WHICH

01:40:26.287 --> 01:40:29.123 region:rollup2
I CAN EVEN BEGIN TO HELP HER

01:40:27.588 --> 01:40:30.258 region:rollup2
WITH UNFORTUNATELY. I'M AYE

01:40:29.123 --> 01:40:31.792 region:rollup2
STUFF AYE TELLER START TO LOOK

01:40:30.258 --> 01:40:33.261 region:rollup2
AT IT LIKE A POSSIBLE RATE WHICH

01:40:31.792 --> 01:40:34.428 region:rollup2
PIECES DO YOU HAVE WHAT DO YOU

01:40:33.261 --> 01:40:36.631 region:rollup2
KNOW LET'S LET'S DECIDE WHICH

01:40:34.428 --> 01:40:37.965 region:rollup2
PIECES ARE MISSING. I I SORT OF

01:40:36.631 --> 01:40:39.534 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THIS IS NOT SAME WAY.

01:40:37.965 --> 01:40:40.568 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO START TO LOOK AT

01:40:39.534 --> 01:40:43.204 region:rollup2
WHAT PIECES ARE THERE.

01:40:40.568 --> 01:40:44.438 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE CAN TRULY IDENTIFY

01:40:43.204 --> 01:40:46.374 region:rollup2
WHAT PIECES ARE MISSING AND I

01:40:44.438 --> 01:40:46.908 region:rollup2
THINK WHAT WE'RE COMMITTED TO IS

01:40:46.374 --> 01:40:48.342 region:rollup2
HELPING TO PUT THE PUZZLE

01:40:46.908 --> 01:40:50.011 region:rollup2
TOGETHER.

01:40:48.342 --> 01:40:51.846 region:rollup2
SO MADE INVITATION FOR US ALL

01:40:50.011 --> 01:40:52.914 region:rollup2
GET A ROOM AND SORTED OUT I'LL

01:40:51.846 --> 01:40:54.315 region:rollup2
SPONSOR THE LIVES NOT JUST

01:40:52.914 --> 01:40:55.449 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I'M HUNGRY AND WANT TO

01:40:54.315 --> 01:40:57.184 region:rollup2
GO TO LUNCH BECAUSE.

01:40:55.449 --> 01:40:58.286 region:rollup2
I THINK IF WE DON'T TAKE

01:40:57.184 --> 01:40:59.687 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGE OF HAVING EVERYONE

01:40:58.286 --> 01:41:01.122 region:rollup2
WHO'S IN THE ROOM RIGHT NOW BE

01:40:59.687 --> 01:41:02.390 region:rollup2
IN A ROOM AND SAY OKAY WHAT WE

01:41:01.122 --> 01:41:03.524 region:rollup2
GONNA DO ABOUT TO COME UP WITH

01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:04.158 region:rollup2
THREE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO

01:41:03.524 --> 01:41:05.493 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S WORKFORCE OF

01:41:04.158 --> 01:41:07.361 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ELSE. WE'VE MISSED THE

01:41:05.493 --> 01:41:08.496 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY AND I DON'T WANT TO

01:41:07.361 --> 01:41:10.031 region:rollup2
MISS AN OPPORTUNITY SO

01:41:08.496 --> 01:41:11.866 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE YOU SAYING YOU WANT

01:41:10.031 --> 01:41:13.501 region:rollup2
BE AT THE TABLE CINEMA GONZALEZ

01:41:11.866 --> 01:41:15.536 region:rollup2
FLETCHER. I THINK. I JUST.

01:41:13.501 --> 01:41:17.405 region:rollup2
ONE ECHO YOUR EAR STATEMENT I

01:41:15.536 --> 01:41:19.407 region:rollup2
MEAN WE KNOW FOR BUSINESS TO BE

01:41:17.405 --> 01:41:21.976 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL YOU NEED CONSUMERS.

01:41:19.407 --> 01:41:24.378 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE WE NEED TO HAVE

01:41:21.976 --> 01:41:26.847 region:rollup2
FOLKS WHO WORK IS IMPORTANT.

01:41:24.378 --> 01:41:28.449 region:rollup2
AYE I GET VERY NERVOUS WHEN WE

01:41:26.847 --> 01:41:30.685 region:rollup2
LOOK AT SOLUTIONS SAID INCLUDE.

01:41:28.449 --> 01:41:33.588 region:rollup2
JUST PAIN PEOPLE NOT WORK.

01:41:30.685 --> 01:41:34.956 region:rollup2
AND SO I I THINK THAT HAVING

01:41:33.588 --> 01:41:36.490 region:rollup2
SOME DISCUSSIONS AROUND SOME

01:41:34.956 --> 01:41:38.359 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL VALUES.

01:41:36.490 --> 01:41:40.127 region:rollup2
AT ABOUT THAT TRANSITION I

01:41:38.359 --> 01:41:42.263 region:rollup2
THINK ONE OF THINGS THAT HAS.

01:41:40.127 --> 01:41:44.031 region:rollup2
REALLY FRUSTRATED ME IS THIS

01:41:42.263 --> 01:41:46.167 region:rollup2
KIND OF LAKE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

01:41:44.031 --> 01:41:47.902 region:rollup2
A SERVICE BASED SOCIETY OR

01:41:46.167 --> 01:41:49.437 region:rollup2
WHATEVER WE HAVE NOW ARE BUT WE

01:41:47.902 --> 01:41:51.005 region:rollup2
HAVE HAD. AND WE'RE GONNA JOHN

01:41:49.437 --> 01:41:53.074 region:rollup2
TO THIS COMPLETELY AUTOMATED

01:41:51.005 --> 01:41:54.442 region:rollup2
SOCIETY WITH NO WORKERS AND WE

01:41:53.074 --> 01:41:56.610 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE.

01:41:54.442 --> 01:41:58.679 region:rollup2
AND GRAND WE ALL TALK IN

01:41:56.610 --> 01:42:00.214 region:rollup2
HYPERBOLE HERE SO SOMETIMES YOU

01:41:58.679 --> 01:42:00.648 region:rollup2
NOW WE GET CAUGHT UP IN THAT.

01:42:00.214 --> 01:42:03.117 region:rollup2
AND.

01:42:00.648 --> 01:42:04.919 region:rollup2
AND I HAVE A HARD TIME BECAUSE

01:42:03.117 --> 01:42:06.320 region:rollup2
I I THINK MY GUT REACTION AS A

01:42:04.919 --> 01:42:07.455 region:rollup2
FORMER LABOR LEADER IS TO BE

01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:08.789 region:rollup2
LIKE WHY DON'T WANT ANY OF US

01:42:07.455 --> 01:42:09.657 region:rollup2
THEN YOU KNOW IF IF YOU'RE GONNA

01:42:08.789 --> 01:42:10.191 region:rollup2
TALK LIKE THAT WILL WE DON'T

01:42:09.657 --> 01:42:13.060 region:rollup2
pOPPOSE EVERY. DRIVERLESS

01:42:10.191 --> 01:42:14.061 region:rollup2
VEHICLE

01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:15.896 region:rollup2
BILL.

01:42:14.061 --> 01:42:18.065 region:rollup2
WHICH I HAVE AND AND YOU KNOW I

01:42:15.896 --> 01:42:18.899 region:rollup2
MEAN IT YOU KNOW JUST ON AND ON

01:42:18.065 --> 01:42:19.600 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT THESE ARE JOB

01:42:18.899 --> 01:42:20.968 region:rollup2
KILLERS.

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:22.269 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT PRODUCTIVE AT THEIR

01:42:20.968 --> 01:42:23.637 region:rollup2
AND I'M I'M VERY WELL AWARE OF

01:42:22.269 --> 01:42:25.239 region:rollup2
THAT BUT I THINK HAPPEN AND I

01:42:23.637 --> 01:42:27.008 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THAT'S RIGHT LIKE.

01:42:25.239 --> 01:42:28.509 region:rollup2
MAYBE MAYBE WE'VE GONE ABOUT

01:42:27.008 --> 01:42:30.378 region:rollup2
THIS WRONG AND MAYBE THE RIGHT

01:42:28.509 --> 01:42:31.112 region:rollup2
WAY IS AND HOW THESE PUBLIC

01:42:30.378 --> 01:42:33.414 region:rollup2
HEARINGS MAYBE IT IS.

01:42:31.112 --> 01:42:34.515 region:rollup2
REALLY WITH SOME PRESSURE

01:42:33.414 --> 01:42:36.017 region:rollup2
HAVING SOME VERY REALISTIC

01:42:34.515 --> 01:42:38.319 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS.

01:42:36.017 --> 01:42:39.587 region:rollup2
WITH EVERYBODY AT THE TABLE TO

01:42:38.319 --> 01:42:41.022 region:rollup2
SAY YOU KNOW.

01:42:39.587 --> 01:42:42.023 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT.

01:42:41.022 --> 01:42:44.525 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO BACK TO

01:42:42.023 --> 01:42:46.861 region:rollup2
THE PRE INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY. OR

01:42:44.525 --> 01:42:48.796 region:rollup2
OR THAT THE INDUSTRIAL AGE AND

01:42:46.861 --> 01:42:51.032 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO TO.

01:42:48.796 --> 01:42:52.500 region:rollup2
ROBOTIC GAUGE SO SO HOW DO WE.

01:42:51.032 --> 01:42:54.101 region:rollup2
.

01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:54.835 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE WORK TOGETHER IN IN

01:42:54.101 --> 01:42:56.537 region:rollup2
FACT THE TRAINING STUFF IN

01:42:54.835 --> 01:42:57.905 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR I THINK I'M REALLY

01:42:56.537 --> 01:43:00.307 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN BECAUSE IT'S NOT

01:42:57.905 --> 01:43:01.742 region:rollup2
JUST WORKFORCE TRAINING I'M FOR

01:43:00.307 --> 01:43:03.978 region:rollup2
THE EXISTING WORK FORCE THAT WE

01:43:01.742 --> 01:43:05.546 region:rollup2
CAN KIND OF? WAIT OUT THE TIME I

01:43:03.978 --> 01:43:06.947 region:rollup2
THINK ON ON ON SOME FOLKS THE

01:43:05.546 --> 01:43:08.416 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE BUT OUR NEXT

01:43:06.947 --> 01:43:09.784 region:rollup2
GENERATION LIKE YOU SAID OF KIDS

01:43:08.416 --> 01:43:11.152 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT BEING TRAINED FOR

01:43:09.784 --> 01:43:12.820 region:rollup2
THESE JOBS EITHER AND THAT'S

01:43:11.152 --> 01:43:14.021 region:rollup2
PROBLEMATIC I MEAN THE FACT THAT

01:43:12.820 --> 01:43:16.257 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE. WE HAVE AN

01:43:14.021 --> 01:43:17.224 region:rollup2
EXTENDED THE THE SUCCESS OF THE.

01:43:16.257 --> 01:43:18.359 region:rollup2
NEW BUILDING TRADES

01:43:17.224 --> 01:43:20.361 region:rollup2
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM INTO

01:43:18.359 --> 01:43:21.729 region:rollup2
OTHER SECTORS I'M IN A LOT OF

01:43:20.361 --> 01:43:23.798 region:rollup2
OTHER OUNTRIES HE'S HOUSE THEY

01:43:21.729 --> 01:43:24.098 region:rollup2
FIGURED THAT OUT SO HOW HOW DO

01:43:23.798 --> 01:43:26.133 region:rollup2
WE.

01:43:24.098 --> 01:43:28.002 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IN AND KIND OF I THINK

01:43:26.133 --> 01:43:29.503 region:rollup2
BACK EVEN WHAT WE DON'T SEE T..

01:43:28.002 --> 01:43:30.638 region:rollup2
AND GENERAL YOU KNOW WOULD I

01:43:29.503 --> 01:43:33.174 region:rollup2
WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL THERE'S TO

01:43:30.638 --> 01:43:34.508 region:rollup2
AUTOMOTIVE SHOP YOU KNOW NOW WE

01:43:33.174 --> 01:43:37.244 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THAT YET WE HAVE A

01:43:34.508 --> 01:43:38.379 region:rollup2
WHOLE NEW LINE OF AUTOMOBILES.

01:43:37.244 --> 01:43:40.281 region:rollup2
THAT WILL STILL NEED SERVICE

01:43:38.379 --> 01:43:41.549 region:rollup2
SEEN BY PEOPLE EVEN IF THEY'RE

01:43:40.281 --> 01:43:43.617 region:rollup2
RUNNING A COMPUTER TO SERVICE

01:43:41.549 --> 01:43:44.251 region:rollup2
THE CAR AND LIKE WHERE ARE WE

01:43:43.617 --> 01:43:46.654 region:rollup2
GETTING PEOPLE.

01:43:44.251 --> 01:43:48.255 region:rollup2
TRAINED UP TO DO THATTYPE OF

01:43:46.654 --> 01:43:50.524 region:rollup2
WORK IN SOUTH.

01:43:48.255 --> 01:43:51.759 region:rollup2
I THINK THOSE ARE THE KIND OF.

01:43:50.524 --> 01:43:52.893 region:rollup2
EASIER SOFTER DISCUSSIONS YOU

01:43:51.759 --> 01:43:53.694 region:rollup2
KNOW THE BORDER OF THE PUZZLE

01:43:52.893 --> 01:43:55.730 region:rollup2
THAT WE COULD PUT TOGETHER

01:43:53.694 --> 01:43:57.465 region:rollup2
EASIER ON THAT ALLOW US TO GET

01:43:55.730 --> 01:43:58.966 region:rollup2
TO THOSE REALLY TOUGH. ALL BLUE

01:43:57.465 --> 01:43:59.900 region:rollup2
SKY THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHERE

01:43:58.966 --> 01:44:01.936 region:rollup2
THE PIECES MATCH.

01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:02.670 region:rollup2
SO I LOVE THAT ANALOGY BECAUSE

01:44:01.936 --> 01:44:05.039 region:rollup2
I THINK.

01:44:02.670 --> 01:44:06.674 region:rollup2
WERE NOT EVEN DOING A VERY GOOD

01:44:05.039 --> 01:44:10.144 region:rollup2
JOB OF HAVING THAT DISCUSSION.

01:44:06.674 --> 01:44:11.412 region:rollup2

YEARS. THE COMMUNICATION CLOUD

01:44:39.907 --> 01:44:43.477 region:rollup2
IS NOT A NATURALLY OCCURRING

01:44:41.642 --> 01:44:45.513 region:rollup2
PHENOMENON OR IN INFRASTRUCTURE

01:44:43.477 --> 01:44:46.480 region:rollup2
BUILT BY THE INVISIBLE HAND OF

01:44:45.513 --> 01:44:48.249 region:rollup2
THE MARKET.

01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:50.417 region:rollup2
IT IS BUILT AND MAINTAINED BY

01:44:48.249 --> 01:44:52.553 region:rollup2
TRAIN DEDICATED MEMBERS OF CW

01:44:50.417 --> 01:44:53.621 region:rollup2
WAY AND THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IS

01:44:52.553 --> 01:44:55.122 region:rollup2
BEING THE COLLECTED BY

01:44:53.621 --> 01:44:57.091 region:rollup2
CORPORATIONS IN PURSUIT OF

PROFIT. ALL OF THIS WHETHER IT'S

01:44:57.091 --> 01:45:00.361 region:rollup2
ROBOT TO ROBOT HUMAN TO ROLL BUT

01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:03.030 region:rollup2
THIS COMMUNICATION

01:45:00.361 --> 01:45:04.632 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURES DEPENDENT WHAT

01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:06.901 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF

AMERICA ARE DOING NOW. AND AVE

01:45:06.901 --> 01:45:11.038 region:rollup2
DONE IN THE LAST TWO DECADES

01:45:08.969 --> 01:45:11.872 region:rollup2
THAT IT I FIND IT TROUBLING THAT

01:45:11.038 --> 01:45:13.674 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF

01:45:11.872 --> 01:45:16.644 region:rollup2
AMERICA IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS

01:45:13.674 --> 01:45:19.413 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION. BECAUSE WITHOUT THIS

01:45:16.644 --> 01:45:20.848 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE NONE OF THIS WILL

01:45:19.413 --> 01:45:24.485 region:rollup2
BE HAPPENING RIGHT AT THIS VERY

01:45:20.848 --> 01:45:25.419 region:rollup2

THIRTY YEARS NOW IN EARNEST.

01:47:46.994 --> 01:47:53.400 region:rollup2
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT WE'VE

01:47:49.196 --> 01:47:54.768 region:rollup2

HOW IT'S DISPLACED ARE ABOUT

01:49:40.007 --> 01:49:43.444 region:rollup2
WORKERS SINCE BEEN REALLY.

A TRAGEDY. WHEN IT COMES TO THE

AND THAT'S IMPACT THE CALIFORNIA

01:49:49.283 --> 01:49:53.120 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUSLY THEY MOVE HIM.

01:49:51.285 --> 01:49:55.422 region:rollup2
SNOW EAST AND THEN THEY MOVE

01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:56.623 region:rollup2
THEM OVERSEAS AND AT SOME OF IT

01:49:55.422 --> 01:49:58.859 region:rollup2
SO MUCH OF ITS AUTOMATED THAT

01:49:56.623 --> 01:50:01.361 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY A. AFFECTING OUR.

01:49:58.859 --> 01:50:03.030 region:rollup2
CUSTOMERS THE OTHER PART IS THE

01:50:01.361 --> 01:50:05.365 region:rollup2
NEW SYSTEMS THAT THE COMING IN.

01:50:03.030 --> 01:50:06.967 region:rollup2
THE WIRELESS HOME PHONE. A A LOT

01:50:05.365 --> 01:50:08.735 region:rollup2
OF THE WIRELESS PRODUCTS WE

01:50:06.967 --> 01:50:09.303 region:rollup2
STILL WORK ON CABLE COPPER AND

01:50:08.735 --> 01:50:11.238 region:rollup2
OPTICAL FIBER MYSELF I SPICE

01:50:09.303 --> 01:50:12.973 region:rollup2
AND.

01:50:11.238 --> 01:50:14.475 region:rollup2
NO WORKING BOTH.

01:50:12.973 --> 01:50:16.143 region:rollup2
WHAT I'VE DISCOVERED IS THAT

01:50:14.475 --> 01:50:17.444 region:rollup2
THOSE SYSTEMS THAT THEY'RE

01:50:16.143 --> 01:50:19.179 region:rollup2
TRYING TO BRING IN AND OVERLY

01:50:17.444 --> 01:50:19.947 region:rollup2
WHICH A WIRELESS?

01:50:19.179 --> 01:50:21.415 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS

01:50:19.947 --> 01:50:23.283 region:rollup2
WHICH LED TO THE TRAGEDY THAT

01:50:21.415 --> 01:50:24.718 region:rollup2
HAPPENED WHICH CLAIMED OR FORTY

01:50:23.283 --> 01:50:26.453 region:rollup2
LIVES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.

01:50:24.718 --> 01:50:28.455 region:rollup2
THE EFFECTS OF THESE FIRES AND

01:50:26.453 --> 01:50:29.890 region:rollup2
NATURAL AND MAN MADE DISASTERS

01:50:28.455 --> 01:50:30.891 region:rollup2
WILLING TO SEE THAT INCREASE.

01:50:29.890 --> 01:50:32.893 region:rollup2
BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE NOT

01:50:30.891 --> 01:50:33.494 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE CAPACITY THE ABILITY

01:50:32.893 --> 01:50:35.596 region:rollup2
TO REALLY MAINTAIN THOSE

01:50:33.494 --> 01:50:37.197 region:rollup2
NETWORKS. ANOTHER MOVING TO A

01:50:35.596 --> 01:50:39.132 region:rollup2
WIRELESS PLATFORM WHERE I'VE

01:50:37.197 --> 01:50:41.468 region:rollup2
SEEN AND IF YOU GO BACK IN TIME

01:50:39.132 --> 01:50:43.837 region:rollup2
TO FUKUSHIMA. YOU GO TO A

01:50:41.468 --> 01:50:45.472 region:rollup2
HURRICANE AS SANDY IN THE EAST

01:50:43.837 --> 01:50:46.874 region:rollup2
COAST AND YOU SEE PEOPLE LINING

01:50:45.472 --> 01:50:48.242 region:rollup2
UP. AT PAY PHONES.

01:50:46.874 --> 01:50:50.611 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEIR WIRELESS TOWERS

01:50:48.242 --> 01:50:52.779 region:rollup2
WENT DOWN IN SOME CASES IT'S THE

01:50:50.611 --> 01:50:54.414 region:rollup2
TELEPHONE POLES THAT BURN THEN

01:50:52.779 --> 01:50:56.884 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO COPPER CONNECTIVITY.

01:50:54.414 --> 01:50:58.218 region:rollup2
MY POINT IS THIS THAT A LOT OF

01:50:56.884 --> 01:50:59.553 region:rollup2
THESE CORPORATIONS.

01:50:58.218 --> 01:51:01.355 region:rollup2
ARE PUTTING ALL THEIR MONEY INTO

01:50:59.553 --> 01:51:02.689 region:rollup2
THIS PRUDENT PERSON AT THE FIRST

01:51:01.355 --> 01:51:04.324 region:rollup2
RESPONDER NETWORK THE EMERGENCY

01:51:02.689 --> 01:51:04.925 region:rollup2
NETWORK.

01:51:04.324 --> 01:51:06.727 region:rollup2
WELL THERE'S THIS THING CALLED

01:51:04.925 --> 01:51:08.228 region:rollup2
A.

01:51:06.727 --> 01:51:09.997 region:rollup2
I GUESS IT'S PREEMPTION BUT IT'S

01:51:08.228 --> 01:51:11.331 region:rollup2
ALSO CALLED ANOTHER TERM FOR IT

01:51:09.997 --> 01:51:13.100 region:rollup2
IS BRUTAL PREEMPTION I THINK

01:51:11.331 --> 01:51:15.736 region:rollup2
IT'S CALLED. ANYWAY IT'S THE ONE

01:51:13.100 --> 01:51:17.504 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY. USE THE NETWORK THEY

01:51:15.736 --> 01:51:18.572 region:rollup2
TAKE OVER THE NETWORK AND THEN.

01:51:17.504 --> 01:51:20.173 region:rollup2
ONLY FIRST RESPONDED TRAFFIC

01:51:18.572 --> 01:51:21.675 region:rollup2
IT'S ALLOWED ON IT.

01:51:20.173 --> 01:51:22.609 region:rollup2
AND LOT OF OUR CUSTOMERS WHO ARE

01:51:21.675 --> 01:51:24.244 region:rollup2
TRYING TO REACH OUT TO THE LOVE

01:51:22.609 --> 01:51:25.712 region:rollup2
ONES AREN'T ABLE TO. AND THE

01:51:24.244 --> 01:51:27.147 region:rollup2
FACT IS THE NETWORK DOESN'T EVEN

01:51:25.712 --> 01:51:28.882 region:rollup2
HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR THEM WERE

01:51:27.147 --> 01:51:30.250 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT WE THINK

01:51:28.882 --> 01:51:32.019 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE NOT PUTTING ENOUGH

01:51:30.250 --> 01:51:33.554 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT CAPITAL INVESTMENT.

01:51:32.019 --> 01:51:34.721 region:rollup2
THEY NO LONGER OPERATING

01:51:33.554 --> 01:51:36.190 region:rollup2
