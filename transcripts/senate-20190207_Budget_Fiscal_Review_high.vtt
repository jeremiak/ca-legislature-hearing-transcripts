PROPOSAL SO THE FIRST THING I'LL

00:14:30.736 --> 00:14:31.270
SAY IS WE DO HAVE --

00:14:31.337 --> 00:14:33.339

COOKING --

00:16:08.767 --> 00:16:10.469
THIS DOES NOT REPRESENT THE LONG

00:16:10.536 --> 00:16:12.705
TERM SOLUTION THAT I KNOW THE

00:16:12.771 --> 00:16:13.772
GOVERNOR IS COMMITTED.

00:16:13.839 --> 00:16:15.307
TO BUT WE ARE DEALING WITH

00:16:15.374 --> 00:16:17.976
COMMUNITIES IN CRISIS RIGHT NOW.

QUICK QUESTIONS ON THE ESTATE

00:16:36.195 --> 00:16:38.130
EMERGENCY TELEPHONE NUMBER

00:16:38.197 --> 00:16:38.697
ACCOUNT WHY ARE WE MAKING IT

00:16:38.764 --> 00:16:39.331
ALONE.

00:16:39.398 --> 00:16:41.033
SO THE REASON WE DECIDED TO

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.101
PROPOSE THAT IS ALONE IN THIS IS

00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:43.469
CAN JUMP IN CONJUNCTION WITH

00:16:43.535 --> 00:16:44.770
THAT BUDGET COMMITTEE STAFFS

00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:45.604
OVER HERE.

00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:48.340
IS THAT WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A

00:16:48.407 --> 00:16:49.641
LOT OF CONVERSATION TO BE BAD

00:16:49.708 --> 00:16:51.043
ABOUT HOW THIS WILL BE FUNDED

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:52.611
OVER THE LONG TERM --

00:16:52.678 --> 00:16:54.079
AND THERE YOU KNOW SOME FOLKS I

00:16:54.146 --> 00:16:55.647
KNOW THINK THAT WE MIGHT HAVE

00:16:55.714 --> 00:16:57.416
MONEY IN THE GENERAL FUND THE

00:16:57.483 --> 00:16:59.051
ADMINISTRATION'S VIEW IS THAT.

00:16:59.118 --> 00:16:59.885
MOST OF THE GENERAL FUND MONEY

00:16:59.952 --> 00:17:01.453
WE HAD THIS ONE TIME AND TO

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.621
ACTUALLY MAKE THESE IMPORTANT

00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:04.623
IMPROVEMENTS ON AN ONGOING BASIS

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:05.891
WE NEED A SUSTAINABLE

00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:08.527
SUSTAINABLE FORCE --

00:17:08.594 --> 00:17:10.429
SOURCE OF FUNDING.

00:17:10.496 --> 00:17:11.930
WE THOUGHT THAT THIS. TO SIDING

00:17:11.997 --> 00:17:12.798
ON HOW THAT SHOULD BE FUNDED

00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:14.099
WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WE COULD

00:17:14.166 --> 00:17:15.667
DO IN TWO TO THREE WEEKS --

00:17:15.734 --> 00:17:16.902
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THIS REVIEW

00:17:16.969 --> 00:17:18.370
IS REALLY AN EMERGENCY

00:17:18.437 --> 00:17:19.938
APPROPRIATIONS WHILE WE HAD THAT

00:17:20.005 --> 00:17:21.607

THE LONG TERM.

00:17:22.541 --> 00:17:23.842
SO THAT'S WHY WE THOUGHT IT

00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:26.612
COULD BE ALONE MAKE SURE WE

00:17:26.678 --> 00:17:27.379
BEGIN TO BUILD THOSE

00:17:27.446 --> 00:17:29.081

00:17:44.663 --> 00:17:46.198
ISSUES OF WHY WE'RE HAVING THIS

00:17:46.265 --> 00:17:47.933
PROBLEM TO BEGIN WITH AND IN

00:20:25.724 --> 00:20:27.426
WHATEVER ISSUES COME UP WHATEVER

00:20:27.492 --> 00:20:29.227

COMMITMENT IS I BELIEVE IN ORDER

00:20:55.954 --> 00:20:57.422
BECAUSE OF THE MAGNITUDE.

00:20:57.489 --> 00:20:59.324
AND THE FACT THAT THERE HAVE

00:20:59.391 --> 00:21:02.494
BEEN OTHER HUGE EVENTS THAT HAVE

00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:04.229
BEEN AFFECTING THAT COUNTY.

00:21:04.296 --> 00:21:06.298
AND INDEED POTABLE WATER IS A

00:21:06.365 --> 00:21:07.499
BIG ISSUE.

00:21:07.566 --> 00:21:09.234
UP THERE RIGHT NOW.

00:21:09.301 --> 00:21:12.804

SOLUTIONS.

00:21:15.774 --> 00:21:18.110
GOING AHEAD FOR OTHER COUNTIES

00:21:18.176 --> 00:21:20.612
AS WELL AND WE NEED TO BE AWARE

00:21:20.679 --> 00:21:22.014
OF HOW WE DEVELOP THOSE.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.016
BUT THE KEY IS THE RESPONSE AND

00:21:24.082 --> 00:21:25.317
THE IMMEDIACY OF THE NEED RIGHT

00:21:25.384 --> 00:21:27.486
NOW.

00:21:27.552 --> 00:21:29.788
THE NINE ONE ONE I HAVE NOT BEEN

TO SYMPATHETIC BUTLAST HEARING.

00:21:33.091 --> 00:21:35.127
IT WAS ENCOURAGING TO HAVE SOME

00:21:35.193 --> 00:21:36.695
DEFINITIVE DISCUSSION.

00:21:36.762 --> 00:21:38.797
ABOUT WHAT THAT'S TO LOOK LIKE

00:21:38.864 --> 00:21:41.066
AND WHAT IT IS TO ACCOMPLISH IN

00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:42.501
NINE TREAT YOU AS WE PROCEED. TO

00:21:42.567 --> 00:21:44.536
BE VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT IS

00:21:44.603 --> 00:21:45.871
THE PLAN.

00:21:45.937 --> 00:21:49.107
WEEK WE CAN'T JUST RACE HE IN A

00:21:49.174 --> 00:21:51.276
DIFFERENT MANNER.

00:21:51.343 --> 00:21:55.247
AND THEN NOT LOWERED WILL GET.

00:21:55.313 --> 00:21:57.082
AND THERE HAS TO BE A STAGING

00:21:57.149 --> 00:21:58.483
AND A GOOD PROGRAM.

00:21:58.550 --> 00:21:59.918
GOING AHEAD OF HOW WE'RE GOING

00:21:59.985 --> 00:22:02.587
TO UTILIZED AND IN A FORMAT.

00:22:02.654 --> 00:22:04.856
THAT NEW INTEGRATED. ONE NINE

00:22:04.923 --> 00:22:06.224
ONE ONE SYSTEM.

00:22:06.291 --> 00:22:07.793
A BE WATCHING VERY CLOSELY OVER

00:22:07.859 --> 00:22:09.795
THAT WITH THE POLICE LAST WEEK I

00:22:09.861 --> 00:22:11.029
WAS FOR THE FIRST TIME A LITTLE

00:22:11.096 --> 00:22:13.465
BIT ENCOURAGED COULD SEE BROUGHT

00:22:13.532 --> 00:22:16.535
FOR SOME DEFINITIVE INFORMATION.

00:22:16.601 --> 00:22:17.335
THIRTY ROCK.

00:22:17.402 --> 00:22:19.037
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF YOU

00:22:19.104 --> 00:22:21.173
KNOW WITH RESPECT TO THE THE

00:22:21.239 --> 00:22:22.207
WATER FEE.

00:22:22.274 --> 00:22:23.742
AND THE LIKE I I DON'T THINK ANY

00:22:23.809 --> 00:22:26.978
OF US OF REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT --

00:22:27.045 --> 00:22:28.146
UP HERE.

00:22:28.213 --> 00:22:30.749
AND IN THE LARGER BODY --

00:22:30.816 --> 00:22:32.084
WOULD ARGUE THAT WE HAVE A

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:33.852
SERIOUS NEED IN CALIFORNIA THEIR

00:22:33.919 --> 00:22:35.721
COMMUNITIES.

00:22:35.787 --> 00:22:37.723
MANY OF THEM DISADVANTAGED THAT

00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:38.023
ARE.

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:41.493
THAN SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.061
TO WATER THAT'S APPROPRIATE.

00:22:43.128 --> 00:22:44.396
TO DRINK OR COOK WITH OR DO

00:22:44.463 --> 00:22:47.365
ANYTHING ELSE WITH --

00:22:47.432 --> 00:22:49.201
I ASSUME THE MONEY THAT WOULD BE

00:22:49.267 --> 00:22:51.169
GENERATED BY A FEE WOULD BE USED

00:22:51.236 --> 00:22:54.306
TO PROVIDE OPERATIONAL SUBSIDIES.

00:22:54.372 --> 00:22:55.440
TO THESE SMALL DISTRICTS SENSE

00:22:55.507 --> 00:22:56.475
THERE APPEARS TO BE MONEY

00:22:56.541 --> 00:22:58.009
THROUGH VARIOUS BONDS WATER

00:22:58.076 --> 00:22:59.978
BONDS IN THE LIKE AVAILABLE FOR

00:23:00.045 --> 00:23:01.546
CAPITAL PROJECTS.

00:23:01.613 --> 00:23:03.115
SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:23:03.181 --> 00:23:05.250
OPERATIONAL SUBSIDIES. TO TRY TO

00:23:05.317 --> 00:23:06.685
DRIVE THE COST OF THE WATER DOWN

00:23:06.752 --> 00:23:08.653
SO IT'S REASONABLE ONCE WE GET

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.489
IT TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S

00:23:10.555 --> 00:23:12.390
CAPABLE OF BEING CONSUMED.

00:23:12.457 --> 00:23:14.159
I'D LIKE TO SEIZE BEFORE THIS

00:23:14.226 --> 00:23:15.293
COMES BACK.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.295
AND I KNOW WHAT WILL I'D LIKE TO

00:23:17.362 --> 00:23:18.964
SEE SOME ANALYSIS DONE TO

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:20.265
DETERMINE.

00:23:20.332 --> 00:23:21.633
HOW MANY OF THESE SMALL WATER

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.135
COME COMPANIES ARE

00:23:23.201 --> 00:23:24.836
GEOGRAPHICALLY REMOTE WHERE IT

00:23:24.903 --> 00:23:26.471
IS ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE TO

00:23:26.538 --> 00:23:27.939
CONNECT?

00:23:28.006 --> 00:23:29.274
WITH THE PIPING OF A LARGER

00:23:29.341 --> 00:23:31.042
WATER DISTRICT WHETHER WE

00:23:31.109 --> 00:23:32.644
REQUIRE THAT.

00:23:32.711 --> 00:23:34.679
CONSOLIDATION OR CONNECTION OR

00:23:34.746 --> 00:23:36.815
SIMPLY INCENTIVIZE.

00:23:36.882 --> 00:23:39.251
AND HOW MANY OR ASSOCIATED

00:23:39.317 --> 00:23:41.219
HOWEVER REMOTELY WITH LARGER

00:23:41.286 --> 00:23:43.188
WATER DISTRICTS WERE SUCH.

00:23:43.255 --> 00:23:44.790
REQUIREMENT OR INCENTIVIZE

00:23:44.856 --> 00:23:47.259
CONSOLIDATION COULD OCCUR AND

00:23:47.325 --> 00:23:48.660
THEN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR

00:23:48.727 --> 00:23:51.830
EXAMPLE THAT WOULD BE NEEDED. TO

00:23:51.897 --> 00:23:53.431
OPERATIONALLY SUBSIDIZE THE

00:23:53.498 --> 00:23:55.500
SMALL GEOGRAPHICALLY REMOTE

00:23:55.567 --> 00:23:57.569
WATER DISTRICTS.

00:23:57.636 --> 00:23:59.237
I THINK THAT WOULD HELP US SOME

00:23:59.304 --> 00:24:00.338
OF THOSE.

00:24:00.405 --> 00:24:01.807
WERE THIS WATER FEE IS A VERY

00:24:01.873 --> 00:24:03.375
VERY SENSITIVE ISSUE.

00:24:03.441 --> 00:24:03.975
HELP US DEAL WITH THE

00:24:04.042 --> 00:24:07.746
SENSITIVITY OF AS WE UNDERSTAND

00:24:07.813 --> 00:24:09.414
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE NEED.

00:24:09.481 --> 00:24:10.782
AND WHERE WE'RE GOING TO GET IT

00:24:10.849 --> 00:24:12.117
WHETHER WE GET IT THROUGH WATER

00:24:12.184 --> 00:24:14.119
FEE OR WHETHER WE GET IT THROUGH

00:24:14.186 --> 00:24:15.687
A COMBINATION OF A WATER FEE AND

00:24:15.754 --> 00:24:17.589
SOME TRUST ACCOUNT THAT WE BUILD

00:24:17.656 --> 00:24:18.857
TO THE GENERAL FUND OVER A

00:24:18.924 --> 00:24:20.792
PERIOD OF YEARS.

00:24:20.859 --> 00:24:22.661
OR SOME OTHER MECHANISM --

00:24:22.727 --> 00:24:23.829
AND WE CAN ANSWER THOSE

00:24:23.895 --> 00:24:25.430
QUESTIONS TODAY I DON'T EXPECT

00:24:25.497 --> 00:24:26.731
TO BUT I WOULD LIKE SOMEONE ELSE

00:32:16.534 --> 00:32:18.770
FINANCE PROJECT RECESSIONS.

00:32:18.836 --> 00:32:20.271
IT'S VERY HARD TO PREDICT WHEN

00:32:20.338 --> 00:32:22.340
OR HOW IT DOWNTURN WILL OCCUR

00:32:22.407 --> 00:32:23.574
THERE'S AN OLD JOKE --

00:32:23.641 --> 00:32:25.510
THAT ECONOMISTS HAD PREDICTED

00:32:25.576 --> 00:32:26.644
NINE OUT OF THE LAST FIVE

00:32:26.711 --> 00:32:28.680
RECESSIONS SO WE DON'T KNOW WHEN

00:32:28.746 --> 00:32:30.682
IT'LL HAPPEN BUT THAT BEING THAT

00:32:30.748 --> 00:32:31.649
BEING SAID --

00:32:31.716 --> 00:32:33.084
WE HAVE MODERN WE HAVE MODEL

00:32:33.151 --> 00:32:35.687
MODEL THE RECESSION INTERNALLY --

00:32:35.753 --> 00:32:37.021
FOR WHAT IF SCENARIO WHITE MIGHT

00:32:37.088 --> 00:32:38.556
LOOK LIKE AND WHAT THE FACTS

00:32:38.623 --> 00:32:39.457
THAT IT MIGHT HAVE.

00:32:39.524 --> 00:32:40.591
THE SCENARIO THAT WE PUT

00:32:40.658 --> 00:32:42.226
TOGETHER INTERNALLY --

00:32:42.293 --> 00:32:44.262
ASSUMES A RECESSION THAT IS LESS

00:32:44.329 --> 00:32:45.563
SEVERE THAN THE GREAT RECESSION

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:47.765
THAT WE SAW IN TWO THOUSAND AND

00:32:47.832 --> 00:32:49.167
EIGHT BUT MORE SEVERE THAN THE

00:32:49.233 --> 00:32:50.868
RECESSION THAT WE SAW AT THE END

00:32:50.935 --> 00:32:52.870
OF THE FIRST DOT COM BOOM AT THE

00:32:52.937 --> 00:32:54.205
END OF THE NINETEEN NINETIES.

00:32:54.272 --> 00:32:56.140
AND UNDER THAT SCENARIO --

00:32:56.207 --> 00:32:58.576
WE PROJECTED A LOSS IN REVENUE

00:32:58.643 --> 00:33:00.244
OF TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS

00:33:00.311 --> 00:33:01.879
OVER ONE YEAR.

00:33:01.946 --> 00:33:05.149
AND SIXTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS

00:33:05.216 --> 00:33:06.417
OVER [inaudible]

00:33:06.484 --> 00:33:10.588
TO EVEN ASSUME THAT PROPOSITION

00:33:10.655 --> 00:33:11.489
NINETY EIGHT WOULD BE FUNDED AT

00:33:11.556 --> 00:33:13.291
ITS MINIMUM LEVEL YOU'D STILL

00:33:13.358 --> 00:33:15.560
HAVE ABOUT FORTY BILLION DOLLARS

00:33:15.626 --> 00:33:16.394
IN -- THE

00:33:16.461 --> 00:33:17.595
BUDGET ISSUE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE

00:33:17.662 --> 00:33:19.330
TO ADDRESS SO THESE ARE THE

00:33:19.397 --> 00:33:21.232
REASONS THAT WE WANT TO BE READY

00:33:21.299 --> 00:33:22.800
FOR NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS AND

00:33:22.867 --> 00:33:24.435
WE WANTED TO BUILD.

00:33:24.502 --> 00:33:25.870
RESILIENCY RIGHT NOW.

00:33:25.937 --> 00:33:27.605
AND WE REALLY PUT IT IN JUST A

00:33:27.672 --> 00:33:30.074
COUPLE OF IMPORTANT CATEGORIES

00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:31.876
THE FIRST IS THE RATIO OF ONE

00:33:31.943 --> 00:33:34.011
TIME TO ON GOING SPENDING.

00:33:34.078 --> 00:33:35.813
WE KNOW AS WE DISCUSSED LAST

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.415
MONTH THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AS

00:33:37.482 --> 00:33:39.050
WELL AS THE LA OUT IS PROJECTING

00:33:39.117 --> 00:33:41.486
A SURPLUS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF

00:33:41.552 --> 00:33:42.720
TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS.

00:33:42.787 --> 00:33:44.655
BUT ALMOST ALL ABOUT SURPLUS IS

00:33:44.722 --> 00:33:46.057
ONE TIME AND IF WE COMMITTED TO

00:33:46.124 --> 00:33:47.959
ONGOING SPENDING IT WOULD

00:33:48.025 --> 00:33:49.026
INCREASE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE

00:33:49.093 --> 00:33:50.194
BUDGET PROBLEM THAT WE WOULD

00:33:50.261 --> 00:33:51.596
FACE IN FUTURE YEARS.

00:33:51.662 --> 00:33:53.164
IN THE EVENT OF A RECESSION SO

00:33:53.231 --> 00:33:54.732
WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES

00:33:54.799 --> 00:33:57.402
AND ITS BUDGET IS A RATIO OF SIX

00:33:57.468 --> 00:33:58.336
TO ONE SO THAT MEANS FOR EVERY

00:33:58.403 --> 00:33:58.970
DOLLAR.

00:33:59.036 --> 00:34:00.004
THAT WE'RE COMMITTING AN ON

00:34:00.071 --> 00:34:01.639
GOING SPENDING WE'RE COMMITTING

00:34:01.706 --> 00:34:03.074
ABOUT SIX DOLLARS IN ONE TIME

00:34:03.141 --> 00:34:04.709
SPENDING AND THAT SPENDING THAT

00:34:04.776 --> 00:34:06.577
WILL NOT RECUR SHOULD A DOWNTURN

00:34:06.644 --> 00:34:08.413
OCCUR IN THE BUDGET YEAR OR IN

00:34:08.479 --> 00:34:09.680
FUTURE YEARS.

00:34:09.747 --> 00:34:10.448
THE SECOND THING THAT WE'RE

00:34:10.515 --> 00:34:12.216
DOING IS PROPOSING PAYING OFF A

00:34:12.283 --> 00:34:14.485
NUMBER OF BUDGETARY DEBTS AND

00:34:14.552 --> 00:34:15.920
DEFERRALS AND THAT INCLUDES TWO

00:34:15.987 --> 00:34:17.822
POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS.

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:19.757
IN BUDGETARY DATS RELATED TO

00:34:19.824 --> 00:34:21.826
LOANS FROM SPECIAL FUNDS ONES

00:34:21.893 --> 00:34:23.194
FROM TRANSPORTATION WAIT FEW

00:34:23.261 --> 00:34:25.630
LOANS AND SOME OTHER CATEGORIES

00:34:25.696 --> 00:34:27.098
AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE.

00:34:27.165 --> 00:34:30.067
THESE LOANS WERE PART OF THAT

00:34:30.134 --> 00:34:33.137
INITIAL WALL AND DOLLARS AT

00:34:33.204 --> 00:34:35.072
START OF THIS DECADE SLOWLY BUT

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:36.073
SURELY THE STATE HAS BEEN

00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:37.842
CHIPPING AWAY AT THAT AND WE

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:39.377
THINK IN THIS TIME WHEN.

00:34:39.444 --> 00:34:40.745
THE ECONOMY REMAINS STRONG WHEN

00:34:40.812 --> 00:34:42.313
WE'RE IN A GOOD BUDGET PLACE WE

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:44.015
WANT TO MAKE SURE TO PAY OFF THE

00:34:44.081 --> 00:34:45.483
REMAINDER OF THOSE BUDGETARY

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:46.384
DEBT LOANS.

00:34:46.451 --> 00:34:46.751
ARE THE LA --

00:34:46.818 --> 00:34:49.253
HAS MADE A COMMENT SUGGESTING.

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.155
THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT WE PAY

00:34:51.222 --> 00:34:52.256
OFF THOSE LOANS BUT OVER A

00:34:52.323 --> 00:34:54.025
SPECIFIED PERIOD WE KNOW THAT'S

00:34:54.091 --> 00:34:54.992
A CONVERSATION THAT WE NEED TO

00:34:55.059 --> 00:34:57.228
HAVE WE THINK OF THAT PAYING OFF

00:34:57.295 --> 00:34:58.863
THOSE LOANS IS CONSISTENT WITH

00:34:58.930 --> 00:34:59.730
COULD BUDGET PRACTICE GOOD

00:34:59.797 --> 00:35:01.098
PHYSICAL HYGIENE.

00:35:01.165 --> 00:35:02.467
AND IS COMPLEMENTARY TO OUR

00:35:02.533 --> 00:35:04.235
PROPOSALS TO MAKE UNPRECEDENTED

00:35:04.302 --> 00:35:06.337
CONTRIBUTIONS INTO ABOUT THE

00:35:06.404 --> 00:35:08.739
CALPERS AND CAL STIRS SYSTEMS.

00:35:08.806 --> 00:35:10.107
FOR OUR DEFERRALS WERE ALSO

00:35:10.174 --> 00:35:12.577
PROPOSING REVERSING THE DEFERRAL

00:35:12.643 --> 00:35:14.512
THAT MOVED PAYROLL FOR THE STATE

00:35:14.579 --> 00:35:15.780
FROM JUNE TO JULY THE NEXT

00:35:15.847 --> 00:35:17.114
FISCAL YEAR --

00:35:17.181 --> 00:35:20.451
AS WELL AS A PAYROLL AS WELL AS

00:35:20.518 --> 00:35:21.352
A DIFFERENT TO CALPERS FOR THE

00:35:21.419 --> 00:35:22.787
QUARTERLY PAYMENT THAT WE SEND

00:35:22.854 --> 00:35:24.355
THEM IN THE SUMMER AND AGAIN WE

00:35:24.422 --> 00:35:26.123
THINK THESE WERE DECISIONS THAT

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:27.825
WERE MADE IN A BUDGET CRISIS.

00:35:27.892 --> 00:35:29.260
NOW AGAIN THAT WE'RE IN A PLACE

00:35:29.327 --> 00:35:30.728
WHERE THE ECONOMY FOR NOW IS

00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:32.463
STRONG AND ON SOLID FOOTING WE

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:33.598
THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT MOVE TO

00:35:33.664 --> 00:35:34.832
REVERSE THOSE DEFERRALS AND GET

00:35:34.899 --> 00:35:37.368
US BACK TO WHAT IS CONSIDERED

00:35:37.435 --> 00:35:37.602
NORMAL.

00:35:37.668 --> 00:35:39.136
BUDGET PRACTICE.

00:35:39.203 --> 00:35:40.505
AT THE SECOND COMPONENT OF THIS

00:35:40.571 --> 00:35:42.006
IS BUILDING UP OUR RESERVES SO

00:35:42.073 --> 00:35:43.541
IN ADDITION TO OUR RAINY DAY

00:35:43.608 --> 00:35:45.009
FUND WHICH WITH THE EXPECTED

00:35:45.076 --> 00:35:47.144
DEPOSIT IN THE BUDGET YEAR OF

00:35:47.211 --> 00:35:48.613
ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS --

00:35:48.679 --> 00:35:50.414
WE'LL GO FROM THIRTEEN POINT

00:35:50.481 --> 00:35:50.982
FIVE TO FIFTEEN POINT THREE

00:35:51.048 --> 00:35:52.383
BILLION DOLLARS IN THAT RAINY

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:53.885
DAY ACCOUNT WERE ALSO PROPOSING

00:35:53.951 --> 00:35:55.253
A SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC

00:35:55.319 --> 00:35:56.754
UNCERTAINTIES THIS IS THE

00:35:56.821 --> 00:35:58.189
STATE'S EMERGENCY ACCOUNT.

00:35:58.256 --> 00:36:03.094
AND ALSO AS WE DISCUSSED IN AB

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:03.694
SEVENTY THREE IN AN EMERGENCY

00:36:03.761 --> 00:36:06.364
BETRAY THE DISASTER RECOVERY

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:08.099
EMERGENCY OP --

00:36:08.165 --> 00:36:11.669
AND THEN FINE ARE PROPOSING

00:36:11.736 --> 00:36:13.304
SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

00:36:13.371 --> 00:36:14.272
FOR THE SAFETY NET RESERVE WHICH

00:36:14.338 --> 00:36:15.973
WOULD MORE THAN QUADRUPLE THE

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.141
AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THAT RESERVE

00:36:17.208 --> 00:36:18.009
AND I WANT TO MAKE A BRIEF

00:36:18.075 --> 00:36:19.744
COMMENT ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:20.578
KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SOME

00:36:20.645 --> 00:36:21.479
MEMBERS.

00:36:21.546 --> 00:36:22.680
MAY HAVE SOME QUESTIONS UP THAT

00:36:22.747 --> 00:36:24.115
RESERVE WAS CREATED LAST YEAR

00:36:24.181 --> 00:36:25.550
WITH INITIALLY TWO HUNDRED

00:36:25.616 --> 00:36:27.251
MILLION DOLLARS IT'S DESIGNED

00:36:27.318 --> 00:36:28.986
FOR BOTH CAL WORKS AND FOR MEDI

00:36:29.053 --> 00:36:31.589
CAL IN THE EVENT OF A DOWNTURN.

00:36:31.656 --> 00:36:33.257
LAST YEAR'S LANGUAGE --

00:36:33.324 --> 00:36:34.959
HAD THE ADMINISTRATION TASKED

00:36:35.026 --> 00:36:35.593
WITH PUTTING TOGETHER A

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:37.261
METHODOLOGY FOR HOW WE WOULD

00:36:37.328 --> 00:36:38.863
NUMBER ONE PUT CONTRIBUTIONS

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:40.264
INTO THAT ACCOUNT.

00:36:40.331 --> 00:36:42.133
AND NUMBER TO THINK ABOUT SOME

00:36:42.199 --> 00:36:43.701
SORT OF FORMULA OR STRUCTURE FOR

00:36:43.768 --> 00:36:45.636
TAKING OUT THOSE FINDS IN THE

00:36:45.703 --> 00:36:47.138
EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY I IN THE

00:36:47.204 --> 00:36:48.573
EVENT OF A DOWNTURN I'M SORRY.

00:36:48.639 --> 00:36:50.041
SO WHAT WE DID WITH THIS

00:36:50.107 --> 00:36:52.310
PROPOSAL LOOKINGINTO IT WE FELT

00:36:52.376 --> 00:36:53.744
THAT OUR PROPOSAL RIGHT NOW.

00:36:53.811 --> 00:36:55.179
IS GETS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE

00:36:55.246 --> 00:36:56.280
GOALS BUT A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:36:56.347 --> 00:36:58.349
FLEXIBLE SO WHEN IT COMES TO THE

00:36:58.416 --> 00:37:00.284
MONEY GOING AND THE METHODOLOGY

00:37:00.351 --> 00:37:01.452
WE COULD HAVE WORKED ON

00:37:01.519 --> 00:37:03.120
SUGGESTED LOOKING AT CASELOAD

00:37:03.187 --> 00:37:04.322
AND TRYING TO USE A NUMBER OF

00:37:04.388 --> 00:37:05.456
DIFFERENT MEASURES.

00:37:05.523 --> 00:37:06.457
WE THOUGHT WHATEVER THOSE

00:37:06.524 --> 00:37:07.558
MEASURES WERE THERE CERTAINLY

00:37:07.625 --> 00:37:08.893
LESS THAN SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.328
DOLLARS THE AMOUNT THAT WE'RE

00:37:10.394 --> 00:37:11.929
PROPOSING PUTTING IN RIGHT NOW.

00:37:11.996 --> 00:37:13.164
AND WE THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:14.398
FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF HOW WE

00:37:14.465 --> 00:37:16.300
FUND THAT ACCOUNT IS IN ORDER

00:37:16.367 --> 00:37:17.802
AND THAT'S A CONVERSATION THAT

00:37:17.868 --> 00:37:19.003
WE KNOW WE WANT TO HAVE A WITH

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:20.071
ALL OF YOU.

00:37:20.137 --> 00:37:22.039
AND SIMILARLY WHEN IT COMES TO

00:37:22.106 --> 00:37:23.541
MONEY COMING OUT OF THAT ACCOUNT --

00:37:23.608 --> 00:37:24.609
WE KNOW A LOT OF OUR BUDGETING

00:37:24.675 --> 00:37:27.078
IN OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE

00:37:27.144 --> 00:37:28.679
BUDGET IS BY FORMULA BUT GIVEN

00:37:28.746 --> 00:37:30.147
IN A DOWNTURN AT BOTH OF THESE

00:37:30.214 --> 00:37:32.183
PROGRAMS WILL HAVE TO MAKE UP

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:34.452
GROUND BUT IN MAY DIFFER BASED

00:37:34.518 --> 00:37:35.987
ON THE NATURE OF THE DOWNTURN.

00:37:36.053 --> 00:37:39.256
HOW MUCH IN THE WHOLE THE CAL

00:37:39.323 --> 00:37:40.324
WORKS PROGRAM MAYES VERSUS AS

00:37:40.391 --> 00:37:43.794
THE MINISTER IS TO HELP GRAHAM'S --

00:37:43.861 --> 00:37:47.498
CONNECT THAT'S RIGHT WITH THE

00:37:47.565 --> 00:37:49.100
NEEDS OF THE LEGISLATURE SO WE

00:37:49.166 --> 00:37:50.835
WANTED TO KEEP THAT FLEXIBLE FOR

00:37:50.901 --> 00:37:51.636
RIGHT NOW --

00:37:51.702 --> 00:37:53.037
SO QUADRUPLE THAT ACCOUNT BRING

00:37:53.104 --> 00:37:53.671
IT TO NINE HUNDRED MILLION

00:37:53.738 --> 00:37:56.007
DOLLARS BUT WHEN IT COMES TO HOW

00:37:56.073 --> 00:37:57.441
MUCH SHOULD GO TO MEDI CAL HOW

00:37:57.508 --> 00:37:58.743
MUCH SHOULD GO TO CAL WORKS

00:37:58.809 --> 00:38:00.177
PRESERVE THE FLEXIBILITY ABOUT

00:38:00.244 --> 00:38:01.312
THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE

00:38:01.379 --> 00:38:03.180
LEGISLATURE.

00:38:03.247 --> 00:38:04.348
A AND THEN THE LAST POINT I'LL

00:38:04.415 --> 00:38:06.684
MAKE IS ON THE PAYMENTS INTO THE

00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:08.719
PURSE STARS AND OTHER RETIREE

00:38:08.786 --> 00:38:10.554
LIABILITIES SYSTEM SO WE'RE

00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:11.856
PROPOSING AT THREE BILLION

00:38:11.922 --> 00:38:13.157
DOLLAR PAYMENT TEMPERS

00:38:13.224 --> 00:38:14.992
SUPPLEMENTAL THAT'S ON TOP OF

00:38:15.059 --> 00:38:16.227
OUR EXISTING.

00:38:16.293 --> 00:38:18.362
OBLIGATIONS AS A STATE TO MAKE

00:38:18.429 --> 00:38:20.064
AND WE'RE PROPOSING AND WE'RE

00:38:20.131 --> 00:38:20.865
WORKING WITH CALPERS TO

00:38:20.931 --> 00:38:22.333
STRUCTURE THAT PAYMENT BUT THOSE

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.402
PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE ON BEHALF

00:38:24.468 --> 00:38:25.603
OF THE GENERAL FUND DATA THAT'S

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:26.837
SOMETHING THAT THE LA --

00:38:26.904 --> 00:38:27.938
HAS POINTED OUT --

00:38:28.005 --> 00:38:29.173
COULD BE COULD PRACTICE AS WELL

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:30.408
SO WE BELIEVE THAT MONEY'S

00:38:30.474 --> 00:38:31.575
COMING FROM THE GENERAL FUND

00:38:31.642 --> 00:38:32.910
WILL BE MADE ON BEHALF OF THE

00:38:32.977 --> 00:38:34.145
GENERAL FUND. FOR ITS

00:38:34.211 --> 00:38:36.447
OBLIGATIONS AND FOR THE CAL

00:38:36.514 --> 00:38:37.748
STIRS SYSTEM --

00:38:37.815 --> 00:38:39.116
WE'RE PROPOSING ONE POINT ONE

00:38:39.183 --> 00:38:40.451
BILLION DOLLARS IN PROP TWO

00:38:40.518 --> 00:38:41.285
PAYMENTS --

00:38:41.352 --> 00:38:43.954
IN THE BUDGET YEAR AN OVERALL --

00:38:44.021 --> 00:38:46.490
GIVEN THAT WE ARE PAYING OFF OUR

00:38:46.557 --> 00:38:47.625
BUDGETARY DADS.

00:38:47.692 --> 00:38:49.093
OUT OF THE BUDGET SURPLUS IN ONE

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.594
TIME FUNDING WE'RE PROPOSING

00:38:50.661 --> 00:38:52.029
THAT NOT JUST THIS YEAR BUT IN

00:38:52.096 --> 00:38:53.497
ALL FUTURE YEARS OVER THE

00:38:53.564 --> 00:38:56.567
BUDGETARY FORECAST PERIOD.

00:38:56.634 --> 00:38:57.201
TWO TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE ALL

00:38:57.268 --> 00:38:58.369
PROP TWO PAYMENTS WILL BE

00:38:58.436 --> 00:39:00.938
DEVOTED TO LONG TERM RETIREE AND

00:39:01.005 --> 00:39:02.840
HEALTH CARE LIABILITIES THAT

00:39:02.907 --> 00:39:04.175
INCLUDES THE CAL STIRS SYSTEM.

00:39:04.241 --> 00:39:06.210
THAT INCLUDES PAYMENTS TO REPAY

00:39:06.277 --> 00:39:07.545
THE SURPLUS MONEY INVESTMENT

00:39:07.611 --> 00:39:09.213
FUND LOAN THAT WAS USED TO MAKE

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.981
A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT TO

00:39:11.048 --> 00:39:12.550
CALPERS TWO YEARS AGO.

00:39:12.616 --> 00:39:15.152
AND THAT INCLUDES PAYMENTS INTO

00:39:15.219 --> 00:39:17.521
THE TRUST FUND.

00:39:17.588 --> 00:39:18.589
SO WE THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE

00:39:18.656 --> 00:39:20.191
USE OF THOSE PRODUCTS TO FUNDS

00:39:20.257 --> 00:39:21.692
AND GIVEN THAT WE PAID OFF OUR

00:39:21.759 --> 00:39:23.194
BUDGETARY DADS WE HAVE THE

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:24.128
ABILITY TO DEVELOP THOSE

00:39:24.195 --> 00:39:27.098
PAYMENTS EXCLUSIVELY. TO THAT

00:39:27.164 --> 00:39:28.132
AND THE LAST POINT I'LL MAKE AND

00:39:28.199 --> 00:39:30.167
THIS ISN'T DIRECTLY IN THE

00:39:30.234 --> 00:39:32.470
BUDGET RESILIENCY BUCKET BUT AS

00:39:32.536 --> 00:39:33.738
YOU KNOW IN ADDITION TO ALL DAYS

00:39:33.804 --> 00:39:36.207
WE ALSO HAVE MONEY DEVOTED TO

00:39:36.273 --> 00:39:37.975
SCHOOLS THE SCHOOLS SHARE --

00:39:38.042 --> 00:39:39.310
BE CAL STIRS LIABILITY SO IT'S

00:39:39.376 --> 00:39:40.878
NOT BUDGET RESILIENCY FOR THE

00:39:40.945 --> 00:39:42.546
STATE BUT IT CERTAINLY MEANS A

00:39:42.613 --> 00:39:43.881
LOT FOR THE SCHOOLS AND WE'VE

00:39:43.948 --> 00:39:45.282
BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY --

00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:47.351
WITH CAL STAR IS ON HOW EXACTLY

00:39:47.418 --> 00:39:48.719
TO STRUCTURE THOSE PAYMENTS BUT

00:39:48.786 --> 00:39:50.387
WE'RE PROPOSING SENDING THREE

00:39:50.454 --> 00:39:52.123
BILLION DOLLARS TO CAL STARS ON

00:39:52.189 --> 00:39:54.091
BEHALF OF THE SCHOOLS. SEVEN

00:39:54.158 --> 00:39:54.892
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT

00:39:54.959 --> 00:39:56.594
WOULD BE USED TO REDUCE DIRECTLY

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:58.362
TO SCHOOLS PAYMENTS TO THE

00:39:58.429 --> 00:39:59.797
SYSTEM IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND IN

00:39:59.864 --> 00:40:01.799
THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY

00:40:01.866 --> 00:40:02.066
ONE YEAR.

00:40:02.133 --> 00:40:03.000
AND THE REMAINDER WOULD BE

00:40:03.067 --> 00:40:05.469
APPLIED TO THE LONG TERM BALANCE

00:40:05.536 --> 00:40:07.705
TO REDUCE SCHOOLS --

00:40:07.772 --> 00:40:08.672
CONTRIBUTION RATE OVER THE LONG

00:40:08.739 --> 00:40:10.040
TERM WE'RE ESTIMATING BY ABOUT

00:40:10.107 --> 00:40:12.009
HALF A PERCENTAGE POINT ALTHOUGH

00:40:12.076 --> 00:40:13.677
WE KNOW THAT THAT CAN CHANGE --

00:40:13.744 --> 00:40:15.045
SO THE LAST THING I WILL SAY IS

00:40:15.112 --> 00:40:16.547
WE ARE CLOSELY MONITORING ALL OF

00:40:16.614 --> 00:40:17.782
THIS WE KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A

00:40:17.848 --> 00:40:19.049
LOT OF ATTENTION.

00:40:19.116 --> 00:40:20.117
IN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS AND

00:40:20.184 --> 00:40:21.452
WEEKS OVER THE STATE'S CASH

00:40:21.519 --> 00:40:22.953
POSITION AND HOW REVENUE

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:25.022
PROJECTIONS ARE COMING AND WE

00:40:25.089 --> 00:40:26.490
BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE OF CHANGES

00:40:26.557 --> 00:40:28.025
IN THE FEDERAL.

00:40:28.092 --> 00:40:29.160
TAX SYSTEM THAT WE DISCUSSED

00:40:29.226 --> 00:40:30.494
THAT TAX LEGISLATION FROM

00:40:30.561 --> 00:40:32.463
DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN A LOT

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:33.964
OF PEOPLE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:40:34.031 --> 00:40:35.733
XCELERATED THEIR PAYMENTS --

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:36.867
THAT WOULD NORMALLY PAY IN

00:40:36.934 --> 00:40:39.003
JANUARY OR APRIL TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:40:39.069 --> 00:40:41.405
AND INSTEAD PAID THOSE IN --

00:40:41.472 --> 00:40:42.039
TWENTY SEVENTEEN WITH THE PLEA

00:40:42.106 --> 00:40:42.907
FOR THOSE WHO QUALIFY FOR A

00:40:42.973 --> 00:40:44.108
HIGHER STATE AND LOCAL TAX

00:40:44.175 --> 00:40:45.442
DEDUCTION.

00:40:45.509 --> 00:40:48.813
SO FOR THAT REASON WE SAW LAST

00:40:48.879 --> 00:40:52.383
PAYING AND WE'RE THINKING THAT A

00:40:52.449 --> 00:40:53.551
LOT OF THE PAYMENTS THAT HAD

00:40:53.617 --> 00:40:55.085
BEEN MADE IN DECEMBER TWENTY

00:40:55.152 --> 00:40:56.153
SEVENTEEN WILL NOW BE MADE OVER

00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:57.555
THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS AND

00:40:57.621 --> 00:40:59.256
ESPECIALLY IN A BRAWL WHEN TAX

00:40:59.323 --> 00:41:00.057
DAY COMES TO SO.

00:41:00.124 --> 00:41:01.959
IN MARCH AND APRIL AND MAY WE

00:41:02.026 --> 00:41:03.127
WILL BE IN VERY CLOSE TOUCH WITH

00:41:03.194 --> 00:41:04.528
YOU WE'LL BE WATCHING THOSE

00:41:04.595 --> 00:41:06.096
REVENUE PROJECTIONS TO MAKE SURE

00:41:06.163 --> 00:41:07.331
THAT THE BUDGET WE PROPOSE WITH

00:41:07.398 --> 00:41:09.333
THE MAY REVISE WORKING WITH YOU.

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:10.868
CONTINUES TO BE BALANCING

00:41:10.935 --> 00:41:12.903
REFLECTS THE MOST UP TO DATE --

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:13.871
VIEW OF THE STATE'S CASH

00:41:13.938 --> 00:41:15.606
POSITION AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

00:41:15.673 --> 00:41:16.974
QUESTIONS ONCE EVERYONE WRAPS U

00:41:17.041 --> 00:41:18.042

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND

00:41:25.716 --> 00:41:26.383

00:41:27.351 --> 00:41:27.818
FRONT OF YOU THAT I'LL BE

00:41:27.885 --> 00:41:29.520
SPEAKING FROM HIS HAND OUT IS

00:41:29.587 --> 00:41:31.322
ALSO BASED ON A REPORT THAT OUR

00:41:31.388 --> 00:41:33.357
OFFICE RELEASED A FEW DAYS AGO

00:41:33.424 --> 00:41:35.159
WHICH I HOPE YOU ALSO HAVE A

00:41:35.226 --> 00:41:37.228
COPY OF IN FRONT OF YOU.

00:41:37.294 --> 00:41:38.529
I'M IS SO I'M JUST GONNA HAVE

00:41:38.596 --> 00:41:40.397
SORT OF THREE AREAS OF COMMENTS

00:41:40.464 --> 00:41:43.133
HERE THE FIRST IS.

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.468
TO RE CAP --

00:41:44.535 --> 00:41:46.537
THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE

00:41:46.604 --> 00:41:48.472
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THINKING ABOUT

00:41:48.539 --> 00:41:49.440
THE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THAT

00:41:49.506 --> 00:41:50.007
BUDGET.

00:41:50.074 --> 00:41:51.642
AND THEN I'LL GIVE SOME COMMENTS

00:41:51.709 --> 00:41:53.310
FROM OUR OFFICE IN HELPING THE

00:41:53.377 --> 00:41:54.778
LEGISLATURE TO EVALUATE THAT

00:41:54.845 --> 00:41:56.580
STRUCTURE IN THINKING ABOUT EACH

00:41:56.647 --> 00:41:58.682
OF THOSE MAJOR COMPONENTS.

00:41:58.749 --> 00:42:00.584
BATTLE TRANSITION SPECIFICALLY

00:42:00.651 --> 00:42:02.486
TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS --

00:42:02.553 --> 00:42:04.188
AND GIVE OUR OFFICES COMMENTS

00:42:04.255 --> 00:42:05.756
AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON THOSE AND

00:42:05.823 --> 00:42:07.925
THOSE FALL INTO THREE AREAS --

00:42:07.992 --> 00:42:10.227
RESERVES PAYING OFF RETIREMENT

00:42:10.294 --> 00:42:12.096
LIABILITIES AND PAYING OFF

00:42:12.162 --> 00:42:16.433
BUDGETARY BORROWING.

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.402
ON THE FIRST PAGE.

00:42:18.469 --> 00:42:19.003
OUR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED

00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:19.870
BUDGET STRUCTURE HAS FOUR MAJOR

00:42:19.937 --> 00:42:20.771
COMPONENTS.

00:42:20.838 --> 00:42:22.273
THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES INCREASING

00:42:22.339 --> 00:42:23.841
RESERVES BY ABOUT TWO BILLION

00:42:23.908 --> 00:42:25.142
DOLLARS WHICH WOULD INCREASE

00:42:25.209 --> 00:42:27.278
TOTAL RESERVES I WROTE RELATIVE

00:42:27.344 --> 00:42:28.212
TO THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETY

00:42:28.279 --> 00:42:28.913
BUDGET ACT AND THAT WOULD

00:42:28.979 --> 00:42:30.514
INCREASE TOTAL RESERVES. TO

00:42:30.581 --> 00:42:32.549
ROUGHLY EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS

00:42:32.616 --> 00:42:33.617
THE LARGEST OF THIS WOULD OF

00:42:33.684 --> 00:42:34.118
COURSE BE IN THE BUDGET

00:42:34.184 --> 00:42:36.086
STABILIZATION ACCOUNT WHICH IS

00:42:36.153 --> 00:42:36.620
THE STATE'S CONSTITUTIONAL

00:42:36.687 --> 00:42:40.991
RESERVE CREATED BY PROPOSITION --

00:42:41.058 --> 00:42:41.892
TWO THERE WAS ALREADY A PRETTY

00:42:41.959 --> 00:42:43.160
GOOD DESCRIPTION OF THE SAFETY

00:42:43.227 --> 00:42:44.561
NET RESERVE BUT THAT WAS ALSO

00:42:44.628 --> 00:42:46.664
INCREASING FROM TWO HUNDRED

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:48.399
MILLION TO NINE HUNDRED MILLION.

00:42:48.465 --> 00:42:50.534
AND THEN A PRETTY KEY FEATURE OF

00:42:50.601 --> 00:42:51.769
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET STRUCTURE

00:42:51.835 --> 00:42:53.370
IS HIS NEARLY ELEVEN BILLION

00:42:53.437 --> 00:42:56.440
DOLLAR PACKAGE TO REPAY US

00:42:56.507 --> 00:42:57.741
STATES DOUBTS IN MY ABILITIES.

00:42:57.808 --> 00:43:00.144
THESE FALL INTO TWO MAJOR AREAS

00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:01.879
THE FIRST IS TO ADDRESS LONG

00:43:01.946 --> 00:43:03.213
TERM RETIREMENT LIABILITIES

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:04.648
THAT'S ABOUT SIX POINT FOUR

00:43:04.715 --> 00:43:05.649
BILLION DOLLARS.

00:43:05.716 --> 00:43:07.017
AND THE SECOND IS TO ADDRESS

00:43:07.084 --> 00:43:08.352
BUDGETARY BORROWING THOSE ARE

00:43:08.419 --> 00:43:09.620
AMOUNTS OF THE GENERAL FUND HAS

00:43:09.687 --> 00:43:12.456
INCURRED IN PAST YEARS IN ORDER

00:43:12.523 --> 00:43:15.025
TO ADDRESS BUDGET PROBLEMS THAT

00:43:15.092 --> 00:43:16.493
ARE STILL OUTSTANDING.

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:17.962
NEXT THE GOVERNOR PROVIDES

00:43:18.028 --> 00:43:20.030
ROUGHLY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN

00:43:20.097 --> 00:43:21.498
ONE TIME SPENDING.

00:43:21.565 --> 00:43:23.534
AND TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.636
DOLLARS IN ONGOING SPENDING BUT

00:43:25.703 --> 00:43:26.036
ACCORDING TO THE

00:43:26.103 --> 00:43:27.237
ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATES THAT

00:43:27.304 --> 00:43:28.372
TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION WOULD

00:43:28.439 --> 00:43:30.140
RISE TO AROUND THREE POINT FIVE

00:43:30.207 --> 00:43:31.408
BILLION IN THE OUT YEARS ONCE

00:43:31.475 --> 00:43:33.210
FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL OF

00:43:33.277 --> 00:43:36.880
THESE PROGRAMS IS ACHIEVED.

00:43:36.947 --> 00:43:37.681
ON THE NEXT PAGE --

00:43:37.748 --> 00:43:38.315
WE HAVE SOME KEY CONSIDERATIONS

00:43:38.382 --> 00:43:40.918
FOR THE LEAD X. ABOUT EACH OF

00:43:40.985 --> 00:43:42.486
THE STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS OF THE

00:43:42.553 --> 00:43:43.587
BUDGET EACH OF THESE.

00:43:43.654 --> 00:43:45.422
PIECES THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT

00:43:45.489 --> 00:43:46.423
FOR THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE OF

00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:47.558
THE BUDGET AND IT'S LONG TERM

00:43:47.624 --> 00:43:48.659
TRAJECTORY.

00:43:48.726 --> 00:43:50.728
THESE FALL INTO GENERALLY THREE

00:43:50.794 --> 00:43:52.463
AREAS THE FIRST IS THINKING

00:43:52.529 --> 00:43:54.598
ABOUT A RESERVE TARGET WHAT IS

00:43:54.665 --> 00:43:55.699
THE TARGET LEVEL OF RESERVES

00:43:55.766 --> 00:43:57.568
THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE

00:43:57.634 --> 00:43:58.135
TO ACHIEVE BY THE END OF THE

00:43:58.202 --> 00:43:59.136
YEAR.

00:43:59.203 --> 00:44:00.471
THE SECOND IS CONSIDERING

00:44:00.537 --> 00:44:02.506
ALLOCATING ONE TIME RESOURCES

00:44:02.573 --> 00:44:04.808
AMONG DEBT REPAYMENTS AND THEN

00:44:04.875 --> 00:44:06.110
PROGRAMMATIC COMMITMENTS.

00:44:06.176 --> 00:44:07.378
AND THEN THE THIRD DECIDING THE

00:44:07.444 --> 00:44:09.179
LEVEL OF ON GOING SPENDING FOR

00:44:09.246 --> 00:44:10.514
THE BUDGET.

00:44:10.581 --> 00:44:11.715
THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION

00:44:11.782 --> 00:44:12.483
HERE NOT GONNA WALK THROUGH EACH

00:44:12.549 --> 00:44:13.417
OF THESE --

00:44:13.484 --> 00:44:14.785
CONSIDERATIONS IN DETAIL BUT

00:44:14.852 --> 00:44:17.221
JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF

00:44:17.287 --> 00:44:18.589
THE IMPORTANT ONES.

00:44:18.655 --> 00:44:20.524
SO IN THINKING ABOUT RESERVES

00:44:20.591 --> 00:44:22.359
THOSE ARE AVAILABLE FOR TO KEEP

00:44:22.426 --> 00:44:24.094
PURPOSE SAYS ONE IS OF COURSE A

00:44:24.161 --> 00:44:25.829
RECESSION WHEN THE BUDGET CAN

00:44:25.896 --> 00:44:27.765
FACE MULTI BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:44:27.831 --> 00:44:29.633
IN A BUDGET PROBLEM OVER THE

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:30.868
COURSE OF A NUMBER OF YEARS.

00:44:30.934 --> 00:44:32.669
RESERVES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE FOR

00:44:32.736 --> 00:44:34.371
UNEXPECTED EVENTS INCLUDING

00:44:34.438 --> 00:44:35.939
CRISIS IS RELATED TO NATURAL

00:44:36.006 --> 00:44:38.776
DISASTERS AND OTHER COSTLY

00:44:38.842 --> 00:44:40.044
EVENTS FOR THE STATE.

00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:41.345
IN THINKING ABOUT A RECESSION

00:44:41.412 --> 00:44:43.047
SPECIFICALLY THE LEGISLATURE

00:44:43.113 --> 00:44:44.448
WILL WANT TO CONSIDER WHAT SIZE

00:44:44.515 --> 00:44:45.716
OF A RECESSION DOESN'T WANT TO

00:44:45.783 --> 00:44:46.717
PREPARE.

00:44:46.784 --> 00:44:48.452
FOR BEING PREPARED FOR A LARGER

00:44:48.519 --> 00:44:49.753
MORE SUSTAINED RECESSION WOULD

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:50.454
HAVE BEEN CALLED OF COURSE

00:44:50.521 --> 00:44:51.789
INVOLVE HIGHER LEVELS OF

00:44:51.855 --> 00:44:53.123
RESERVES.

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:55.259
A SECOND IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION

00:44:55.325 --> 00:44:56.693
IS WHAT ACTIONS OF THE

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:58.062
LEGISLATURE WILLING TO TAKE

00:44:58.128 --> 00:44:59.830
DURING A RECESSION TO ADDRESS A

00:44:59.897 --> 00:45:01.231
BUDGET PROBLEM.

00:45:01.298 --> 00:45:02.533
SO THOSE ACTIONS COULD BE

00:45:02.599 --> 00:45:04.134
REDUCING PROGRAMMATIC SPENDING

00:45:04.201 --> 00:45:05.836
INCREASING REVENUES ARE SHIFTING

00:45:05.903 --> 00:45:07.571
COSTS AS THE STATE HAS DONE IN

00:45:07.638 --> 00:45:09.073
PREVIOUS RECESSIONS. TO THE

00:45:09.139 --> 00:45:10.307
EXTENT THAT YOU'RE MORE WILLING

00:45:10.374 --> 00:45:11.809
TO TAKE THOSE ACTIONS DURING A

00:45:11.875 --> 00:45:12.810
RECESSION LESS RESERVES ARE

00:45:12.876 --> 00:45:14.278
NEEDED BUT IF YOU'D PREFER TO

00:45:14.344 --> 00:45:16.647
AVOID THOSE ACTIONS THAN MORE

00:45:16.713 --> 00:45:18.615
RESERVES ARE NEEDED.

00:45:18.682 --> 00:45:19.817
THINKING ABOUT ALLOCATING ONE

00:45:19.883 --> 00:45:21.351
TIME COMMITMENTS BETWEEN THAT

00:45:21.418 --> 00:45:22.886
AND PROGRAMS THIS IS REALLY A

00:45:22.953 --> 00:45:24.321
TRADE OFF BETWEEN THE STATE'S

00:45:24.388 --> 00:45:25.789
IMMEDIATE NEEDS VERSES ITS

00:45:25.856 --> 00:45:26.590
FUTURE NEEDS.

00:45:26.657 --> 00:45:27.858
AND THE REASON I SAY THAT IS

00:45:27.925 --> 00:45:29.226
BECAUSE ALLOCATING A DOLLAR

00:45:29.293 --> 00:45:31.328
TODAY TOWARD DAD WELL ACTUALLY

00:45:31.395 --> 00:45:33.063
FREE UP MORE THAN A DOLLAR ON

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:33.797
GOING.

00:45:33.864 --> 00:45:35.032
OVER THE COURSE OF THE BUDGET

00:45:35.099 --> 00:45:37.301
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT GRAHAM

00:45:37.367 --> 00:45:38.969
COMMITMENTS BUT OF COURSE THIS

00:45:39.036 --> 00:45:39.903
PRESENTS A TRADE OFF BECAUSE

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:41.705
THAT DOLLAR THAN CAN'T BE USED

00:45:41.772 --> 00:45:42.739
FOR PROGRAMS TODAY.

00:45:42.806 --> 00:45:43.674
SO IT'S A TRADE OFF BETWEEN

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:44.475
ALLOCATING THAT DOLLAR

00:45:44.541 --> 00:45:45.776
IMMEDIATELY TO THE STATE'S

00:45:45.843 --> 00:45:47.911
IMMEDIATE NEEDS VERSUS

00:45:47.978 --> 00:45:48.512
ALLOCATING THAT DOLLAR IN THE

00:45:48.579 --> 00:45:50.013
FUTURE.

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:51.782
FINALLY CONSIDERING THE LEVEL OF

00:45:51.849 --> 00:45:52.616
ON GOING COMMITMENTS THAT THE

00:45:52.683 --> 00:45:55.052
BUDGET HAS CAPACITY TO TAKE ON

00:45:55.119 --> 00:45:56.019
THIS IS REALLY A BASIC

00:45:56.086 --> 00:45:57.754
CALCULATION BETWEEN HOW MUCH YOU

00:45:57.821 --> 00:46:00.357
EXPECT REVENUES TO GROW RELATIVE

00:46:00.424 --> 00:46:01.725
TO CURRENT ONGOING PROGRAM

00:46:01.792 --> 00:46:02.826
COMMITMENTS.

00:46:02.893 --> 00:46:03.927
OF REVENUES ARE EXPECTED TO GROW

00:46:03.994 --> 00:46:05.829
FASTER THAN CURRENT ONGOING

00:46:05.896 --> 00:46:06.797
PROGRAMS THAT AND THERE ARE SOME

00:46:06.864 --> 00:46:08.365
CAPACITY TO MAKE THOSE

00:46:08.432 --> 00:46:09.666
COMMITMENTS AND IF NOT THEN

00:46:09.733 --> 00:46:11.535
THERE'S PERHAPS LESS CAPACITY TO

00:46:11.602 --> 00:46:14.671
MAKE ON GOING COMMITMENTS.

00:46:14.738 --> 00:46:15.906
SOME OF THE TRANSITION FROM THE

00:46:15.973 --> 00:46:17.574
SORT OF BIG PICTURE --

00:46:17.641 --> 00:46:19.776
STRUCTURAL THING --

00:46:19.843 --> 00:46:21.078
TO THE RESERVES AND THE DEBT

00:46:21.145 --> 00:46:23.614
PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY AND GIVE

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:25.048
OUR OFFICES COMMENTS.

00:46:25.115 --> 00:46:27.184
SO THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES A TOTAL

00:46:27.251 --> 00:46:28.986
RESERVE LEVEL OF EIGHTEEN

00:46:29.052 --> 00:46:29.720
BILLION DOLLARS AS I ALREADY

00:46:29.786 --> 00:46:31.155
MENTIONED AND JUST TO PUT A

00:46:31.221 --> 00:46:32.789
LITTLE CONTEXT AROUND THIS

00:46:32.856 --> 00:46:33.624
EIGHTEEN BILLION.

00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:35.692
OUR OFFICE HAS ESTIMATED IN

00:46:35.759 --> 00:46:37.461
HOUSE REPORTS BUT ABOUT TWENTY

00:46:37.528 --> 00:46:38.695
BILLION WOULD BE REQUIRED TO

00:46:38.762 --> 00:46:39.763
COVER THE BUDGET PROBLEM

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:42.199
ASSOCIATED WITH A MILD RECESSION.

00:46:42.266 --> 00:46:43.333
AND ABOUT FORTY BILLION WILL BE

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:44.334
NEEDED TO COVER THE BUDGET

00:46:44.401 --> 00:46:45.869
PROBLEM ASSOCIATED WITH A MODERN

00:46:45.936 --> 00:46:46.970
RECESSION PROVIDED THAT THE

00:46:47.037 --> 00:46:48.472
LEGISLATURE DID NOT WANT TO TAKE

00:46:48.539 --> 00:46:51.375
ANY OF THOSE ACTIONS REDUCING

00:46:51.441 --> 00:46:52.576
SPENDING OR INCREASING REVENUES.

00:46:52.643 --> 00:46:54.444
IN A NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR WE

00:46:54.511 --> 00:46:55.345
RELEASED OUR FISCAL OUTLOOK OR

00:46:55.412 --> 00:46:57.581
ANNUAL PUBLICATION AND WE FOUND

00:46:57.648 --> 00:46:59.516
THAT THREE BILLION AN ON GOING

00:46:59.583 --> 00:47:01.418
COMMITMENTS WAS SUPPORTABLE OVER

00:47:01.485 --> 00:47:03.086
THE BUDGET MULTI YEAR.

00:47:03.153 --> 00:47:04.188
PROVIDED THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:47:04.254 --> 00:47:05.522
ENTERED A RECESSION SCENARIO

00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:06.857
WITH TWENTY FIVE BILLION IN

00:47:06.924 --> 00:47:08.926
RESERVES.

00:47:08.992 --> 00:47:11.128
SO IF LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKES

00:47:11.195 --> 00:47:12.496
YOU WOULD LIKE TO CONCUR WITH

00:47:12.563 --> 00:47:13.497
THE ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH TO

00:47:13.564 --> 00:47:15.732
TAKE ON ROUGHLY THREE BILLION IN

00:47:15.799 --> 00:47:16.767
ON GOING COMMITMENTS.

00:47:16.833 --> 00:47:17.968
THEN WE DO THINK THAT AT THIS

00:47:18.035 --> 00:47:19.369
TIME MORE RESERVES WOULD BE

00:47:19.436 --> 00:47:21.171
PRUDENT.

00:47:21.238 --> 00:47:23.874
WE HAVE TWO OPTIONS FOR THE L. --

00:47:23.941 --> 00:47:24.841
FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER

00:47:24.908 --> 00:47:26.476
AS IT THINKS ABOUT PERHAPS

00:47:26.543 --> 00:47:28.011
BUILDING MORE RESERVES ONE IS OF

00:47:28.078 --> 00:47:29.746
COURSE TO JUST PUT A DEPOSIT

00:47:29.813 --> 00:47:31.548
INTO ONE OF THE STATE'S OUR CASH

00:47:31.615 --> 00:47:33.016
RESERVES ACCOUNTS.

00:47:33.083 --> 00:47:35.852
AND ANOTHER WOULD BE TO PREPAY

00:47:35.919 --> 00:47:37.588
RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION THIS IS

00:47:37.654 --> 00:47:38.789
A LITTLE BIT TECHNICAL HAPPY TO

00:47:38.855 --> 00:47:39.856
GET INTO AN IN MORE DETAIL IF

00:47:39.923 --> 00:47:40.991
YOU'RE INTERESTED.

00:47:41.058 --> 00:47:42.292
BUT ESSENTIALLY WHAT IT MEANS IS

00:47:42.359 --> 00:47:43.660
THE STATE WOULD TRANSFER TO

00:47:43.727 --> 00:47:45.829
CALPERS EARLY --

00:47:45.896 --> 00:47:47.064
A PAYMENT THAT CALPERS WOULD

00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:47.965
HOLDEN TRUST ESSENTIALLY LIKE

00:47:48.031 --> 00:47:49.533
CALPERS HOLDING THE RESERVE FOR

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:50.400
THE STATE.

00:47:50.467 --> 00:47:51.735
AND THEN THAT COULD BE APPLIED

00:47:51.802 --> 00:47:54.404
TO A FUTURE REQUIRED RETIREMENT

00:47:54.471 --> 00:47:55.906
CONTRIBUTION.

00:47:55.973 --> 00:47:57.007
EDGE OF THIS APPROACH IS THAT

00:47:57.074 --> 00:47:58.742
THE RESERVE OF THAT MONEY ONE

00:47:58.809 --> 00:47:59.543
IT'S HELD A CALPERS CAN ON A

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:01.144
SLIGHTLY HIGHER RATE OF RETURN

00:48:01.211 --> 00:48:01.945
THAT WOULD EARN.

00:48:02.012 --> 00:48:04.248
BEING IN CASH RESERVES BUT THE

00:48:04.314 --> 00:48:05.249
TRADE OFF OF COURSE IS WITH THAT

00:48:05.315 --> 00:48:06.516
WITH GREATER RETURN COMES A

00:48:06.583 --> 00:48:08.418
GREATER LEVEL OF RISK AND SO

00:48:08.485 --> 00:48:10.187
THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT

00:48:10.254 --> 00:48:10.721
WOULD NEED TO BE CAREFULLY

00:48:10.787 --> 00:48:13.390
CONSIDERED.

00:48:13.457 --> 00:48:15.359
ON THE NEXT PAGE JUST TO GIVE A

00:48:15.425 --> 00:48:17.494
BRIEF RECAP OF THE GOVERNOR'S

00:48:17.561 --> 00:48:19.329
RETIREMENT LIABILITY PROPOSAL

00:48:19.396 --> 00:48:21.231
SPECIFICALLY. TO THE GOVERNOR

00:48:21.298 --> 00:48:22.733
PROPOSES MAKING THREE IS

00:48:22.799 --> 00:48:24.067
SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PAYMENTS

00:48:24.134 --> 00:48:25.702
THESE ARE IN CONTRAST TO WHAT I

00:48:25.769 --> 00:48:27.337
JUST TALKED ABOUT ABOUT --

00:48:27.404 --> 00:48:29.339
PREPAYING A RETIREMENT LIABILITY

00:48:29.406 --> 00:48:30.607
THIS IS A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS

00:48:30.674 --> 00:48:33.210
THIS IS IN ADDITION TO A PAYMENT

00:48:33.277 --> 00:48:35.145
AS OPPOSED TO INSTEAD OF A

00:48:35.212 --> 00:48:36.613
FUTURE PAYMENT.

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:38.482
THESE THREE ARE THREE BILLION

00:48:38.548 --> 00:48:40.250
DOLLARS FOR CALPERS ONE BILLION

00:48:40.317 --> 00:48:41.451
DOLLARS FOR CAL STIRS FOR THE

00:48:41.518 --> 00:48:42.552
STATE'S SHARE OF THE

00:48:42.619 --> 00:48:43.720
CONTRIBUTION FOR THE STATE'S

00:48:43.787 --> 00:48:45.055
TRUCK LIABILITY EXCUSE ME.

00:48:45.122 --> 00:48:46.156
AND TWO POINT THREE BILLION TO

00:48:46.223 --> 00:48:47.591
CAL STIRS FOR THE DISTRICTS

00:48:47.658 --> 00:48:49.559
CHAIR OF THE LIABILITY IN MOST

00:48:49.626 --> 00:48:50.327
OF MY COMMENTS ARE JUST GONNA

00:48:50.394 --> 00:48:52.896
FOCUS ON CALPERS AND CASTERS FOR

00:48:52.963 --> 00:48:55.866
THE STATE'S SHARE.

00:48:55.932 --> 00:48:57.401
SO YOU'RE GONNA BE HERE PROBABLY

00:48:57.467 --> 00:48:58.568
MORE ABOUT THIS FROM THE

00:48:58.635 --> 00:49:00.437
ACTUARIES BUT JUST TO LAY THIS

00:49:00.504 --> 00:49:01.438
OUT A LITTLE BIT.

00:49:01.505 --> 00:49:02.739
THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS TO

00:49:02.806 --> 00:49:04.274
THINK ABOUT THE SAVINGS THAT THE

00:49:04.341 --> 00:49:06.043
STATE CAN ACHIEVE FROM EACH OF

00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:07.611
THESE PAYMENTS THE STAVING COM

00:49:07.678 --> 00:49:10.013
BASICALLY FROM LOWER SLIGHTLY

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:11.848
LOWER OVER THE VERY LONG TERM

00:49:11.915 --> 00:49:14.117
REQUIRED EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS

00:49:14.184 --> 00:49:16.153
TO BOTH OF THE SYSTEMS.

00:49:16.219 --> 00:49:17.454
AND THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT

00:49:17.521 --> 00:49:19.089
ESTIMATES FOR THINKING ABOUT HOW

00:49:19.156 --> 00:49:20.624
THE SAVINGS CAN BE ACHIEVED ONE

00:49:20.691 --> 00:49:22.192
IS WHAT'S CALLED AN ACTUARIAL

00:49:22.259 --> 00:49:23.794
MODEL AND ONE IS WHAT'S CALLED A

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:24.795
STOCHASTIC MODEL.

00:49:24.861 --> 00:49:26.496
THE ACTUARIAL MODEL SAYS WE'RE

00:49:26.563 --> 00:49:28.498
GONNA ASSUME ONE FIXED RATE OF

00:49:28.565 --> 00:49:30.600
RETURN IS ACHIEVED EVERY YEAR

00:49:30.667 --> 00:49:32.035
FOR THE NEXT FEW DECADES.

00:49:32.102 --> 00:49:34.471
SO SAY 7% RATE OF RETURN EVERY

00:49:34.538 --> 00:49:35.605
YEAR FOR THE NEXT TWO DECADES.

00:49:35.672 --> 00:49:37.808
THAT IS OBVIOUSLY UNLIKELY IN

00:49:37.874 --> 00:49:39.209
THE REAL WORLD AND SO STOCHASTIC

00:49:39.276 --> 00:49:41.611
MODELS SAYS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF

00:49:41.678 --> 00:49:42.913
THE RATE OF RETURN IS ABOVE THIS

00:49:42.979 --> 00:49:44.381
OR BELOW THIS AND WE LOOK AT

00:49:44.448 --> 00:49:45.215
THOUSANDS OF DIFFERENT --

00:49:45.282 --> 00:49:46.750
THE ACTUARIES LOOKING THOUSANDS

00:49:46.817 --> 00:49:49.252
OF DIFFERENT MODELS AT DIFFERENT

00:49:49.319 --> 00:49:51.154
POSSIBLE RETURN ASSUMPTIONS.

00:49:51.221 --> 00:49:53.323
SO THE SAVINGS FROM EACH OF THE

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:55.092
SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS WOULD VERY

00:49:55.158 --> 00:49:56.326
DEPENDING ON WHETHER YOU LOOK AT

00:49:56.393 --> 00:49:57.527
THE ARCHERY ON MODEL OR THE

00:49:57.594 --> 00:49:58.662
STOCHASTIC MODELS.

00:49:58.729 --> 00:49:59.896
WITH CALPERS THE STOCHASTIC

00:49:59.963 --> 00:50:01.965
MODEL IS A LITTLE BIT HAD

00:50:02.032 --> 00:50:03.166
ACTUALLY OF THE OXFORD A MODEL

00:50:03.233 --> 00:50:04.534
THERE'S LITTLE MORE SAVINGS.

00:50:04.601 --> 00:50:05.869
WITH CAL STIRS THERE'S LESS

00:50:05.936 --> 00:50:09.072
SAVINGS AND IN FACT WITH THE

00:50:09.139 --> 00:50:11.908
CASTERS STATE PAYMENT IN ROUGHLY

00:50:11.975 --> 00:50:12.542
AND I'M SORRY I SHOULD BE VERY

00:50:12.609 --> 00:50:14.111
CLEAR THAT'S OVER THE NEXT FEW

00:50:14.177 --> 00:50:15.712
DECADES NOT OVER THE INFINITE

00:50:15.779 --> 00:50:17.147
TIME HORIZON BUT OVER THE NEXT

00:50:17.214 --> 00:50:20.117
FEW DECADES.

00:50:20.183 --> 00:50:21.718
SO IN FACT OVER THE NEXT FEW

00:50:21.785 --> 00:50:23.420
DECADES --

00:50:23.487 --> 00:50:25.255
ON THE STATE ARE PAYMENT

00:50:25.322 --> 00:50:28.125
FORECASTERS THERE'S A 15220%

00:50:28.191 --> 00:50:28.959
CHANCE THAT THE STATE WOULD

00:50:29.025 --> 00:50:30.694
ACTUALLY ACHIEVE NO SAVINGS AS A

00:50:30.761 --> 00:50:32.429
RESULT OF THAT ONE BILLION

00:50:32.496 --> 00:50:36.199
DOLLARS SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT.

00:50:36.266 --> 00:50:36.500
THINKING --

00:50:36.566 --> 00:50:37.934
THEN NEXT SORT OF SPECIFICALLY

00:50:38.001 --> 00:50:39.136
ABOUT HOW THE CALPERS

00:50:39.202 --> 00:50:40.771
CONTRIBUTION WOULD WORK.

00:50:40.837 --> 00:50:43.907
THERE ARE FIVE DIFFERENTPLANS --

00:50:43.974 --> 00:50:46.109
WITHIN CALPERS THOSE EACH GET

00:50:46.176 --> 00:50:47.778
VARYING CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE

00:50:47.844 --> 00:50:49.179
GENERAL FUND AND THEN OTHER

00:50:49.246 --> 00:50:51.014
FUNDS LIKE SPECIAL FUNDS --

00:50:51.081 --> 00:50:52.416
THEY INCLUDE MISCELLANEOUS PEACE

00:50:52.482 --> 00:50:55.152
OFFICER AND FIREFIGHTERS AND

00:50:55.218 --> 00:50:57.220
HIGHWAY PATROL DEPENDING ON WHAT

00:50:57.287 --> 00:50:59.423
TYPE OF EMPLOYEE --

00:50:59.489 --> 00:51:01.091
HIS OF THE STATE.

00:51:01.158 --> 00:51:02.359
AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN AS

00:51:02.426 --> 00:51:03.693
WE CURRENTLY UNDERSTAND IT WOULD

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:04.594
ESSENTIALLY DIVIDE THE

00:51:04.661 --> 00:51:05.896
SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AMONG

00:51:05.962 --> 00:51:07.831
THOSE PLANS ACCORDING TO HOW

00:51:07.898 --> 00:51:09.266
MUCH THE GENERAL FUND

00:51:09.332 --> 00:51:10.534
CONTRIBUTES TO THEM.

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:11.935
SO SINCE HIGHWAY PATROL DOESN'T

00:51:12.002 --> 00:51:12.936
HAVE ANY GENERAL FUND

00:51:13.003 --> 00:51:14.304
CONTRIBUTION IT WOULD NOT

00:51:14.371 --> 00:51:16.039
RECEIVE A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT.

00:51:16.106 --> 00:51:17.774
BUT THE OTHER PLANS ALL WOOD AND

00:51:17.841 --> 00:51:19.509
THEN THE BENEFIT ASSOCIATED WITH

00:51:19.576 --> 00:51:21.211
A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT WOULD BE

00:51:21.278 --> 00:51:24.548
ACCRUED TO EACH OF THE PLANS

00:51:24.614 --> 00:51:25.682
THAT.

00:51:25.749 --> 00:51:27.751
RECEIVE THE PAYMENT ARE BOTH TO

00:51:27.818 --> 00:51:29.186
SPECIAL FUNDS AND TO THE GENERAL

00:51:29.252 --> 00:51:34.024
FUND.

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:35.659
TURNING TO THE NEXT PAGE THIS

00:51:35.725 --> 00:51:37.527
PROVIDES TO SIR HIGH LEVEL

00:51:37.594 --> 00:51:38.228
COMMENTS --

00:51:38.295 --> 00:51:39.996
ON EACH OF THESE PROPOSALS.

00:51:40.063 --> 00:51:40.664
THINKING ABOUT THE TRADE OFF

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:42.132
BETWEEN CALPERS AND CAL STIRS

00:51:42.199 --> 00:51:43.667
THIS IS REALLY A QUESTION OF

00:51:43.733 --> 00:51:44.734
WHAT IS THE GOAL OF THE

00:51:44.801 --> 00:51:46.369
SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS IF THE

00:51:46.436 --> 00:51:48.405
GOAL OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT

00:51:48.472 --> 00:51:49.206
IS TO ADDRESS THE SYSTEMS WENT

00:51:49.272 --> 00:51:51.107
UNFUNDED LIABILITIES ACROSS THE

00:51:51.174 --> 00:51:52.476
BOARD AT BOTH SYSTEMS.

00:51:52.542 --> 00:51:54.077
THEN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

00:51:54.144 --> 00:51:55.645
DOES ACHIEVE BACK ON BUT IF THE

00:51:55.712 --> 00:51:57.681
LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE A PRIMARY

00:51:57.747 --> 00:52:00.016
GOAL TO ACHIEVE STATE SAVINGS

00:52:00.083 --> 00:52:01.351
OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES.

00:52:01.418 --> 00:52:02.452
AND POSSIBLY A SUPPLEMENTAL

00:52:02.519 --> 00:52:05.288
PAYMENTS TO CALPERS VERSUS CAL

00:52:05.355 --> 00:52:06.823
STIRS WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE.

00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:08.525
ON THINKING ABOUT THE CALPERS

00:52:08.592 --> 00:52:10.093
CONTRIBUTION SPECIFICALLY WE

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:11.561
THINK IT'S BEST TO MAXIMIZE

00:52:11.628 --> 00:52:13.430
GENERAL FUND SAVINGS WHEN USING

00:52:13.497 --> 00:52:15.198
GENERAL FUND RESOURCES.

00:52:15.265 --> 00:52:16.700
AND WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT

00:52:16.766 --> 00:52:17.968
OPTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION IN

00:52:18.034 --> 00:52:20.637
ORDER TO DO THAT. ONE WOULD BE

00:52:20.704 --> 00:52:23.573
TO MAKE THE ENTIRE THREE BILLION

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:24.441
OR WHATEVER AMOUNT.

00:52:24.508 --> 00:52:26.009
OF SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT DIRECTLY

00:52:26.076 --> 00:52:27.277
TO ONE PLAN THE PEACE OFFICERS

00:52:27.344 --> 00:52:29.045
AND FIREFIGHTERS FUND BECAUSE

00:52:29.112 --> 00:52:30.814
IT'S NEARLY ENTIRELY GENERAL

00:52:30.881 --> 00:52:32.649
FUND SUPPORTED.

00:52:32.716 --> 00:52:33.517
BUT THAT WOULD OF COURSE CREE

00:52:33.583 --> 00:52:34.918
PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT FOR ONE

00:52:34.985 --> 00:52:36.052
PLAN VERSUS ALL OF THE OTHERS

00:52:36.119 --> 00:52:37.888
AND SO A SECOND OPTION WOULD BE

00:52:37.954 --> 00:52:39.556
TO STILL MAKE THE CONTRIBUTION

00:52:39.623 --> 00:52:41.191
AMONG ALL FIVE PLANS INCLUDING

00:52:41.258 --> 00:52:42.626
HIGHWAY PATROL WHICH IT DOES NOT

00:52:42.692 --> 00:52:43.827
CURRENTLY BENEFIT UNDER THE

00:52:43.894 --> 00:52:45.161
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL.

00:52:45.228 --> 00:52:46.096
BUT THEN REQUIRE THE SPECIAL

00:52:46.162 --> 00:52:49.199
FUNDS TO FUND FOR THEIR SHARES

00:52:49.266 --> 00:52:50.033
OF THE LOAN.

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:51.067
SPECIAL FUNDS WOULD ACTUALLY

00:52:51.134 --> 00:52:52.769
STILL BE BETTER OFF ON THAT

00:52:52.836 --> 00:52:54.037
BECAUSE THEY WOULD ACHIEVE THE

00:52:54.104 --> 00:52:55.605
GREATER SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:52:55.672 --> 00:52:56.840
A REDUCED RATES.

00:52:56.907 --> 00:52:58.775
BUT THE GENERAL FUND WOULD STILL

00:52:58.842 --> 00:53:00.277
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAXIMIZE

00:53:00.343 --> 00:53:02.646
ITS OWN BENEFIT.

00:53:02.712 --> 00:53:04.047
JUST VERY BRIEFLY WE ALSO

00:53:04.114 --> 00:53:05.115
RECOMMEND MAKING IS TRANSFERS

00:53:05.181 --> 00:53:06.616
LATER IN THE FISCAL YEAR.

00:53:06.683 --> 00:53:07.884
IN PLANNING DOCUMENTS THE

00:53:07.951 --> 00:53:09.586
ADMINISTRATION HAS INDICATED

00:53:09.653 --> 00:53:10.887
THAT IT'S GOING TO MAKE THESE --

00:53:10.954 --> 00:53:14.691
TRANSFERS IN JULY OF TWENTY

00:53:14.758 --> 00:53:15.725
NINETEEN SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS

00:53:15.792 --> 00:53:17.527
IN TOTAL TO CALPERS IMPOSTERS --

00:53:17.594 --> 00:53:18.962
AND GIVEN THAT EVERY YEAR

00:53:19.029 --> 00:53:20.330
REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS ARE

00:53:20.397 --> 00:53:22.332
INHERENTLY ON CERTAIN WE THINK

00:53:22.399 --> 00:53:23.366
IT MAKES SENSE TO WAIT FOR KEY

00:53:23.433 --> 00:53:24.601
REVENUE MONTHS INCLUDING

00:53:24.668 --> 00:53:26.503
DECEMBER JANUARY IN APRIL. FOR

00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:27.837
THE STATE TO JUST ENSURE THAT

00:53:27.904 --> 00:53:29.606
THE SURPLUS IS INDEED AVAILABLE

00:53:29.673 --> 00:53:30.974
BEFORE COMMITTING TO THESE

00:53:31.041 --> 00:53:32.475
TRANSFERS ONCE THESE TRANSFERS

00:53:32.542 --> 00:53:34.077
ARE MADE TO THE SYSTEMS THAT

00:53:34.144 --> 00:53:36.980
CANNOT BE TAKEN BACK SO.

00:53:37.047 --> 00:53:37.380
IT'S AN IMPORTANT.

00:53:37.447 --> 00:53:40.317
MOMENT.

00:53:40.383 --> 00:53:41.585
FINALLY AT BY JUST TO DISCUSS

00:53:41.651 --> 00:53:43.553
THE BUDGETARY BORROWING

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:45.689
PROPOSALS ON THE LAST PAGE.

00:53:45.755 --> 00:53:47.290
THE GOVERNOR HAS TWO MAJOR

00:53:47.357 --> 00:53:48.892
PROPOSALS TO REPAY BUDGETARY

00:53:48.959 --> 00:53:51.561
BORROWING. ONE IS --

00:53:51.628 --> 00:53:53.263
AS ALREADY MENTIONED ABOUT TWO

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:54.397
BILLION DOLLARS TO REPAY

00:53:54.464 --> 00:53:55.832
OUTSTANDING SPECIAL FUND LOANS

00:53:55.899 --> 00:53:57.100
THIS WOULD ELIMINATE THE CURRENT

00:53:57.167 --> 00:53:58.401
MULTI YEAR PLAN THAT'S ALREADY

00:53:58.468 --> 00:54:00.303
IN PLACE. TO REPAY THOSE LOANS

00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:02.305
OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS AND THEN

00:54:02.372 --> 00:54:03.473
THE USE THAT THAT ADDITIONAL

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:07.043
CAPACITY FOR CASTERS PAYMENTS.

00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:08.712
THE SECOND PROPOSAL IS TO USE

00:54:08.778 --> 00:54:09.679
ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS

00:54:09.746 --> 00:54:11.214
IN GENERAL FUND ON DUE TO

00:54:11.281 --> 00:54:12.649
BUDGETARY DEFERRALS --

00:54:12.716 --> 00:54:15.218
JUST ADDING A LITTLE BIT OF

00:54:15.285 --> 00:54:15.785
DETAIL TO THOSE JUNE JULY

00:54:15.852 --> 00:54:18.121
PAYROLL AND CALPERS FOURTH

00:54:18.188 --> 00:54:20.590
QUARTER JUNE JULY PAYROLL TO FOR

00:54:20.657 --> 00:54:21.491
ALL DOES NOT AFFECT PAVE.

00:54:21.558 --> 00:54:23.093
HEY ROLE IN ANYWAY SO DOES NOT

00:54:23.159 --> 00:54:24.194
AFFECT EMPLOYEES JACK'S IT'S

00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:26.363
JUST AN ACCOUNTING --

00:54:26.429 --> 00:54:27.797
MECHANISM.

00:54:27.864 --> 00:54:29.099
AND A BOTH OF THESE DEFERRALS

00:54:29.165 --> 00:54:29.933
ACTUALLY ACHIEVE ON GOING

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.502
SAVINGS FOR THE GENERAL FUND AND

00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:33.670
THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE

00:54:33.737 --> 00:54:35.005
PAYROLL GROWS OVER TIME AND

00:54:35.071 --> 00:54:36.306
PENSION COSTS GROW OVER TIME SO

00:54:36.373 --> 00:54:38.875
PAYING FOR THE PREVIOUS JUNE OF

00:54:38.942 --> 00:54:40.844
THE PREVIOUS FOURTH QUARTERS.

00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:41.778
PAYROLL OR TRY OUR CALPERS

00:54:41.845 --> 00:54:42.679
PAYMENT IS A LITTLE BIT CHEAPER

00:54:42.746 --> 00:54:44.080
THAN FOR THE CURRENT YEAR.

00:54:44.147 --> 00:54:45.448
SO THERE'S ABOUT A HUNDRED

00:54:45.515 --> 00:54:48.451
MILLION AN ONGOING GENERAL CHIEF

00:54:48.518 --> 00:54:50.086
STRUCK BY HAVING THESE IN PLACE

00:54:50.153 --> 00:54:52.255
AND I'M DOING THEM WOULD UNDO

00:54:52.322 --> 00:54:54.424
THAT A GENERAL FUND BENEFIT.

00:54:54.491 --> 00:54:55.859
SO JUST A COUPLE COMMENTS ON

00:54:55.925 --> 00:54:57.060
THESE WE DO RECOMMEND

00:54:57.127 --> 00:54:59.129
PRIORITIZING RETIREMENT

00:54:59.195 --> 00:55:00.330
LIABILITIES OVER THE SPECIAL

00:55:00.397 --> 00:55:02.165
FUND LOANS USING TWO POINT ONE

00:55:02.232 --> 00:55:03.199
BILLION DOLLARS TO PAY OFF

00:55:03.266 --> 00:55:04.501
SOMETHING THAT'S MUCH HIGHER

00:55:04.567 --> 00:55:05.201
INTEREST LIKE MAKING AN

00:55:05.268 --> 00:55:06.569
ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTION TO

00:55:06.636 --> 00:55:07.804
CALPERS.

00:55:07.871 --> 00:55:09.005
VERSES REPAYING A SPECIAL PHONE

00:55:09.072 --> 00:55:10.640
LINES WOULD SAY THE STATE AT

00:55:10.707 --> 00:55:11.374
LEAST HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

00:55:11.441 --> 00:55:12.242
DOLLARS --

00:55:12.308 --> 00:55:13.476
AND THEN THE STATE COULD STILL

00:55:13.543 --> 00:55:15.578
MAINTAIN ITS EXISTING ON MULTI

00:55:15.645 --> 00:55:18.114
YEAR PLAN TO REPAY THOSE SPECIAL

00:55:18.181 --> 00:55:19.382
FROM LOANS.

00:55:19.449 --> 00:55:20.116
AND THEN SECOND WE RECOMMEND

00:55:20.183 --> 00:55:21.384
REJECTING THE PROPOSAL TO UNDO

00:55:21.451 --> 00:55:23.887
THESE DEFERRALS --

00:55:23.953 --> 00:55:25.155
FIRST BECAUSE IT DOES ELIMINATE

00:55:25.221 --> 00:55:26.423
THAT GENERAL FUND SAVINGS THAT

00:55:26.489 --> 00:55:28.992
IS ONGOING AND IN FACT IF MONEY

00:55:29.059 --> 00:55:30.060
IS HOLDEN RESERVES AND THAT

00:55:30.126 --> 00:55:30.994
THERE CAN BE.

00:55:31.061 --> 00:55:31.861
A LITTLE BIT OF INTEREST

00:55:31.928 --> 00:55:34.064
ASSOCIATED WITH IT SO --

00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:35.732
IF THE GOAL IS TO BUILD MORE

00:55:35.799 --> 00:55:37.233
BUDGET RESILIENCY AND TO HAVE

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:38.868
SOMETHING THAT'S LIKE A RESERVE

00:55:38.935 --> 00:55:39.803
THEN THEY'RE JUST --

00:55:39.869 --> 00:55:42.272
MORE EFFECTIVE WAYS OF KEEPING

00:55:42.338 --> 00:55:44.674
UP WITH ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION.

00:55:44.741 --> 00:55:46.509
BASIC QUESTIONS.

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:23.539
IF WE WERE TO RECEIVE THE MONEY

01:02:23.606 --> 01:02:24.874
NOW CLARIFIED TO SIT IN THE

01:02:24.941 --> 01:02:25.541
SECOND.

01:02:25.608 --> 01:02:28.444
OR BOARD WAS GIVEN THE ABILITY

01:02:28.511 --> 01:02:30.012
TO ADJUST FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE

01:02:30.079 --> 01:02:31.380
CONTRIBUTION RATE.

01:02:31.447 --> 01:02:33.015
BY NO MORE THAN A HALF A PERCENT

01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:35.518
OF PAYROLL IN ANY GIVEN YEAR IF

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:36.686
IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE

01:02:36.752 --> 01:02:39.088
CONTRIBUTIONS NEEDED TO INCREASE

01:02:39.155 --> 01:02:40.123
IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THE

01:02:40.189 --> 01:02:42.792
UNFUNDED LIABILITY.

01:02:42.859 --> 01:02:43.793
SO TODAY WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:45.595
UNFUNDED LIABILITY IT'S ABOUT A

01:02:45.661 --> 01:02:47.296
HUNDRED AND SEVEN BILLION THAT'S

01:02:47.363 --> 01:02:48.464
THE LATEST FIGURE THAT WE'VE

01:02:48.531 --> 01:02:50.366
GIVEN TO OUR BOARD.

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:51.667
AND YOU STILL HAVE A PACKET IN

01:02:51.734 --> 01:02:53.603
FRONT OF YOU.

01:02:53.669 --> 01:02:55.271
IF YOU OPENED A PACKET WE HAVE A

01:02:55.338 --> 01:02:57.640
TWO PIECES OF PAPER.

01:02:57.707 --> 01:02:59.275
ON ONE OF THEM YOU WILL SEE A

01:02:59.342 --> 01:03:01.744
SHEET THAT HAS THE PIGGY BANK ON

01:03:01.811 --> 01:03:03.513
IT ANY PIE CHART.

01:03:03.579 --> 01:03:06.282
IF YOUR INTERESTED SO THE THE

01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:07.316
HUNDRED AND SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR

01:03:07.383 --> 01:03:08.951
OF UNFUNDED LIABILITY WE HAVE IN

01:03:09.018 --> 01:03:10.453
OUR SYSTEM TODAY.

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:11.687
ABOUT THIRTY FIVE BILLION

01:03:11.754 --> 01:03:14.023
DOLLARS IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF

01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:16.325
THE STATE AND ABOUT SEVENTY ONE

01:03:16.392 --> 01:03:18.628
BILLION IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF

01:03:18.694 --> 01:03:22.999
THE EMPLOYERS.

01:03:23.065 --> 01:03:23.766
THE STATE RIGHT NOW THEY'RE

01:03:23.833 --> 01:03:25.168
PROPOSING A PAYMENT OF ONE POINT

01:03:25.234 --> 01:03:26.602
ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE

01:03:26.669 --> 01:03:28.804
BUDGET YEAR TO REDUCE THE CEMENT.

01:03:28.871 --> 01:03:31.274
SO HERE IS WHERE --

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:31.841
TO DEMEAN MESSAGE WILL BEEN

01:03:31.908 --> 01:03:34.443
TELLING EVERYONE ALWAYS BE

01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:36.846
SAVINGS FROM ANY CONTRIBUTION

01:03:36.913 --> 01:03:38.014
THAT ARE SENT THE CALLOUSED OR

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:39.315
IS TO REDUCE THE UNFUNDED

01:03:39.382 --> 01:03:40.650
LIABILITY.

01:03:40.716 --> 01:03:42.785
FOR WHAT IS ON CERTAIN WITH US

01:03:42.852 --> 01:03:45.888
BECAUSE OUR BOARD HAS LIMITED

01:03:45.955 --> 01:03:47.623
THE RATE SETTING AUTHORITY.

01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:48.991
IS.

01:03:49.058 --> 01:03:51.727
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT.

01:03:51.794 --> 01:03:53.563
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE MAY NOT

01:03:53.629 --> 01:03:55.665
BE ABLE TO SET CONTRIBUTION

01:03:55.731 --> 01:03:58.668
RATES TO LEVELS THAT REFLECT THE

01:03:58.734 --> 01:04:02.371
LUMP SUM RECEIVED BY THE STATE.

01:04:02.438 --> 01:04:03.839
TO JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.

01:04:03.906 --> 01:04:06.075
TODAY WE ARE WE ARE STILL NOT

01:04:06.142 --> 01:04:08.110
COLLECTING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

01:04:08.177 --> 01:04:09.445
WE SHOULD BE COLLECTING TO

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:11.681
ELIMINATE THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY.

01:04:11.747 --> 01:04:13.182
BECAUSE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE STILL

01:04:13.249 --> 01:04:14.784
SCHEDULED TO INCREASE IT SET IN

01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:16.953
STATUTE SO FOR THE STATE TO WE

01:04:17.019 --> 01:04:18.721
ARE ABOUT FOUR YEARS AWAY.

01:04:18.788 --> 01:04:20.423
FROM BEING AT THE LEVEL THAT WE

01:04:20.489 --> 01:04:22.959
NEED TO IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE

01:04:23.025 --> 01:04:23.826
THE THIRTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR

01:04:23.893 --> 01:04:25.828
OF UNFUNDED LIABILITY BY TWO

01:04:25.895 --> 01:04:27.563
THOUSAND AND FORTY SIX WITH THE

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:29.332
PROPOSAL'S PAYMENTS.

01:04:29.398 --> 01:04:31.100
OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS WE

01:04:31.167 --> 01:04:33.169
EXPECT THAT WE WON'T NEED THE

01:04:33.236 --> 01:04:35.404
LAST YEAR OF THE INCREASES SUE

01:04:35.471 --> 01:04:37.440
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS PROPOSAL.

01:04:37.506 --> 01:04:38.941
IF YOU JUST IF THE GOAL IS TO

01:04:39.008 --> 01:04:41.377
HAVE SAVINGS EVERY SINGLE YEAR

01:04:41.444 --> 01:04:42.979
FOR THE STATE IN THEIR IN THEIR

01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:45.748
CONTRIBUTION TO CAL STAR IS FROM

01:04:45.815 --> 01:04:46.983
THIS LUMP SUM.

01:04:47.049 --> 01:04:47.717
IT MOST LIKELY WILL NOT BE

01:04:47.783 --> 01:04:49.619
POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT RIGHT NOW WE

01:04:49.685 --> 01:04:50.653
KNOW WHAT IT FOR THE FIRST THREE

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.455
YEARS THE CONTRIBUTION RATE IS

01:04:52.521 --> 01:04:53.556
GOING TO BE THE SAME WHAT ARE WE

01:04:53.623 --> 01:04:54.924
GET A LUMP SUM OR NOT.

01:04:54.991 --> 01:04:56.058
IT'S GOING TO BE IN THE FORTY

01:04:56.125 --> 01:04:57.426
HERE THAT THE STATE MAY START

01:04:57.493 --> 01:04:58.761
RECEIVING SAVINGS.

01:04:58.828 --> 01:05:01.897
NOW ONCE YOU START LOOKING AT

01:05:01.964 --> 01:05:04.100
THE ONCE YOU START LOOK AT A

01:05:04.166 --> 01:05:06.068
REAL WORLD SITUATION WE ON THE

01:05:06.135 --> 01:05:07.169
WIN IF WE LIVE IN AN UNCERTAIN

01:05:07.236 --> 01:05:08.070
WORLD WE ALL KNOW THAT

01:05:08.137 --> 01:05:08.871
INVESTMENT MARKETS GO UP AND

01:05:08.938 --> 01:05:10.273
DOWN.

01:05:10.339 --> 01:05:12.308
AND IF YOU LOOK YOU KNOW NONE OF

01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:13.809
US KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS.

01:05:13.876 --> 01:05:14.944
BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE MAY

01:05:15.011 --> 01:05:19.315
GO TO TWO DECADES OF RETURNS BI

01:05:19.382 --> 01:05:21.384
LO WHAT WE ISSUE MCALISTER'S WE

01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:23.085
CURRENTLY ASSUME 7%.

01:05:23.152 --> 01:05:24.820
UNDER SUCH SCENARIO IF WE WERE

01:05:24.887 --> 01:05:27.156
TO EARN LEXUS SIX AND A HALF OR

01:05:27.223 --> 01:05:29.258
6% -- FOR US

01:05:29.325 --> 01:05:30.359
AT CAL STAR IS BECAUSE OF OUR

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:32.161
LIMITED RATE SETTING AUTHORITY

01:05:32.228 --> 01:05:33.663
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO KEEP

01:05:33.729 --> 01:05:33.929
IN MIND.

01:05:33.996 --> 01:05:34.964
OR BOARD.

01:05:35.031 --> 01:05:37.199
WOULD HAVE TO INCREASE THE STATE

01:05:37.266 --> 01:05:39.068
CONTRIBUTION RATE BY HALF A

01:05:39.135 --> 01:05:40.436
PERCENT EACH YEAR.

01:05:40.503 --> 01:05:43.572
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE RECEIVE

01:05:43.639 --> 01:05:45.174
THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS ARE NOT SO

01:05:45.241 --> 01:05:46.509
THE QUESTION IS.

01:05:46.575 --> 01:05:47.810
IS THE LUMP SUM GOING TO

01:05:47.877 --> 01:05:49.378
GENERATE SAVINGS.

01:05:49.445 --> 01:05:51.380
THE ANSWER IS YES IT TWELVE BUT

01:05:51.447 --> 01:05:53.149
WHAT IS ON CERTAIN IS THE TIMING

01:05:53.215 --> 01:05:54.850
WHEN EXACTLY AND I CAN TELL YOU

01:05:54.917 --> 01:05:56.519
ONE THING EVEN IN SITUATIONS

01:05:56.585 --> 01:05:57.920
WHERE MAY BE.

01:05:57.987 --> 01:05:59.188
THERE MAY NOT BE ANY SAVINGS FOR

01:05:59.255 --> 01:06:01.324
THE FIRST TEN FIFTEEN OR TWENTY

01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:02.892
YEARS BECAUSE OF FOR LET'S SEE

01:06:02.958 --> 01:06:03.693
WE GO THROUGH A PERIOD OF LOW

01:06:03.759 --> 01:06:04.560
RETURNS.

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:06.395
THIS ADDITIONAL MONEY WILL

01:06:06.462 --> 01:06:09.231
ACCUMULATE OVER TIME AND ANY

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:11.067
MONEY WE GET TODAY YOU CAN BE

01:06:11.133 --> 01:06:13.469
SURE THAT EVEN IF THE STATE HAS

01:06:13.536 --> 01:06:15.204
YET TO EXPERIENCE ANY SAVINGS.

01:06:15.271 --> 01:06:16.772
YOU CAN EXPECT THE UNFUNDED

01:06:16.839 --> 01:06:18.874
LIABILITY IF WE STILL HAVE ONE

01:06:18.941 --> 01:06:20.910
BY TWO THOUSAND FORTY SIX IS

01:06:20.976 --> 01:06:22.044
GOING TO BE AT LEAST FOUR FIVE

01:06:22.111 --> 01:06:24.380
TIMES LOWER THAN THE PAYMENT WE

01:06:24.447 --> 01:06:25.514
RECEIVED FROM THE STATE.

01:06:25.581 --> 01:06:26.949
SO IF WE WERE TO RECEIVE ONE

01:06:27.016 --> 01:06:28.084
BILLION.

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:31.454
EVEN IF THE STATE DOES NOT

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:32.755
EXPRESS ANY SAY LONG TERM THAT

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:36.492
WE SAVINGS AND IN TWO THOUSAND

01:06:36.559 --> 01:06:37.960
AND FORTY SIX IT MAY MEAN THAT

01:06:38.027 --> 01:06:39.729
YOU UNFUNDED LIABILITY THIS THE

01:06:39.795 --> 01:06:41.464
THE THE SHARE THAT THE STATE IS

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:42.965
RESPONSIBLE.

01:06:43.032 --> 01:06:44.834
FOR MAYBE LARA BY FORTY FIVE

01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:46.135
BILLION DOLLARS TO SAVINGS WILL

01:06:46.202 --> 01:06:48.604
ALWAYS BE REALIZE BUT WHAT'S ON

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:50.005
CERTAIN WITH US IS.

01:06:50.072 --> 01:06:52.375
ONE AND WITH THIS I WOULD BE

01:06:52.441 --> 01:06:54.210
HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS.

01:06:54.276 --> 01:06:56.545
EXCELLENT BEFORE I OPEN IT UP TO

01:06:56.612 --> 01:06:57.780
MEMBERS --

RESPOND ANYTHING YOU HEARD

01:07:00.483 --> 01:07:02.017
BEFORE I COLLEAGUES TO MAKE

01:07:02.084 --> 01:07:05.020
COMMENTS.

01:07:06.188 --> 01:07:08.023
TO BELIEVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY.

01:07:08.090 --> 01:07:08.858
NOTHING SHOULD BE OKAY OKAY

01:07:08.924 --> 01:07:10.860
PERFECT --

01:07:10.926 --> 01:07:12.395
LET ME ASK A QUICK QUESTION

01:07:12.461 --> 01:07:13.963
FIRST AND I'M GONNA PUT OVER TO

01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:17.266
SENATOR PAN FOLLOWED BY MINING

01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:20.736
FOLLOWED BY MORE LOT --

01:07:20.803 --> 01:07:21.637
THE LA --

01:07:21.704 --> 01:07:23.205
NOTES THAT --

01:07:23.272 --> 01:07:25.074
PROPOSING THIS SEVEN BILLION

01:07:25.141 --> 01:07:26.542
DOLLAR TRANSFERRED CALPERS AND

01:07:26.609 --> 01:07:28.944
CAL STIRS IN JULY WOULD.

01:07:29.011 --> 01:07:31.247
LIMIT THE STATE'S FLEXIBILITY

01:07:31.313 --> 01:07:32.248
AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU

01:07:32.314 --> 01:07:34.683
HAVE ANY CONCERNS AROUND.

01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:36.685
CASH DEFICITS ARE CASH FLOW

01:07:36.752 --> 01:07:38.821
ISSUES AND IF SO WHAT.

01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:40.423
WOULD BE YOUR PLAN TO MITIGATE.

01:07:40.489 --> 01:07:42.458
SO THERE ARE TWO COMPONENTS OF

01:07:42.525 --> 01:07:44.360
THAT IN THE FIRST DAYS --

01:07:44.427 --> 01:07:45.661
SO FOR THE PURPOSE PAYMENT IT'S

01:07:45.728 --> 01:07:47.329
COMING FROM THE GENERAL FUND

01:07:47.396 --> 01:07:49.532
SURPLUS AND FOR THE SISTERS CAME

01:07:49.598 --> 01:07:51.267
AND THIS IS THE PART THAT IS ON

01:07:51.333 --> 01:07:52.601
BEHALF OF THE STATE RATHER THAN

01:07:52.668 --> 01:07:53.702
THE SCHOOLS.

01:07:53.769 --> 01:07:55.438
THAT'S COMING UNDER PROP --

01:07:55.504 --> 01:07:58.707
TO PAYMENT BY THIS FORMULA IN

01:07:58.774 --> 01:08:00.676
THE CONSTITUTION SO AS OUR

01:08:00.743 --> 01:08:03.345
REVENUES ARE UPDATED IN MAY AND

01:08:03.412 --> 01:08:03.979
THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS IN

01:08:04.046 --> 01:08:04.780
JUNE.

01:08:04.847 --> 01:08:06.015
THAT ACTUAL LEVEL WHICH WERE

01:08:06.081 --> 01:08:07.450
RIGHT NOW ESTIMATING AT ONE

01:08:07.516 --> 01:08:08.984
POINT EIGHT BILLION OVERALL FOR

01:08:09.051 --> 01:08:10.886
PROP TO DEBT PAYMENTS OF WHICH

01:08:10.953 --> 01:08:12.855
ONE POINT ONE WERE RIGHT NOW

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:14.256
THINKING WE WILL DEVOTE TO STIRS.

01:08:14.323 --> 01:08:15.991
ABOUT WILL FLUCTUATE SO WE WILL

01:08:16.058 --> 01:08:17.092
BE BACK WITH AN UPDATED ESTIMATE

01:08:17.159 --> 01:08:18.627
IN MAY SO THAT THERE'S A BUILT

01:08:18.694 --> 01:08:20.329
IN MECHANISM TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:08:20.396 --> 01:08:22.531
WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS IN LINE

01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:23.632
WITH WHAT WE CAN AFFORD.

01:08:23.699 --> 01:08:24.800
IT WHEN IT COMES TO THE THREE

01:08:24.867 --> 01:08:27.136
BILLION DOLLARS FOR CALPERS ON

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:29.004
THERE THERE'S A TRADE OFF SO ON

01:08:29.071 --> 01:08:30.873
THE ONE HAND IF YOU DELAY THAT

01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:32.708
PAYMENT AND MAKE IT LATER IN THE

01:08:32.775 --> 01:08:34.376
YEAR INTO THE NEXT YEAR --

01:08:34.443 --> 01:08:36.078
THEN THAT CAN GIVE YOU

01:08:36.145 --> 01:08:36.612
ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY TO

01:08:36.679 --> 01:08:37.079
ADJUSTED.

01:08:37.146 --> 01:08:38.814
AT THE SAME TIME --

01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:41.217
FOR EXACTLY THE REASONS WERE

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:41.684
TALKING ABOUT WITH THE

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:42.818
INVESTMENT RETURN RATE EVERY

01:08:42.885 --> 01:08:44.386
MONTH THAT YOU DELAY PUTTING

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:46.489
THAT MONDAY AT THAT MONEY AND

01:08:46.555 --> 01:08:47.089
IT'S A MONEY WHERE YOU'RE NOT

01:08:47.156 --> 01:08:48.924
EARNING THE RIGHT ON THAT AND

01:08:48.991 --> 01:08:50.459
AND WITH THREE BILLION DOLLARS

01:08:50.526 --> 01:08:51.460
IN OR EVEN A SMALL DATA THAT'S

01:08:51.527 --> 01:08:51.894
THAT'S A LOT.

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:52.728
OF MONEY --

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:53.529
SO THAT'S THE TRADE OFF THAT WE

01:08:53.596 --> 01:08:56.499
WERE THINKING OUT IN TERMS OF

01:08:56.565 --> 01:08:57.032
SCHEDULING THAT AS SOON AS

01:08:57.099 --> 01:09:00.870
POSSIBLE [inaudible] THIRTY PM.

01:09:00.936 --> 01:09:01.637
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I ONCE

01:09:01.704 --> 01:09:04.473
AGAIN THANK ALL THE PRESENTERS --

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:06.775
USED FOR THE QUESTION HAS TO DO

01:09:06.842 --> 01:09:08.210
WITH -- THE

01:09:08.277 --> 01:09:10.346
ACTUALLY THE SAFETY NET RESERVES --

01:09:10.412 --> 01:09:12.882
SO YOU KNOW YOU --

01:09:12.948 --> 01:09:14.817
THEN THE DESIRE FOR FLEX

01:09:14.884 --> 01:09:17.253
FLEXIBILITY HOWEVER --

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:19.488
I ALSO WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT --

01:09:19.555 --> 01:09:21.156
WE DO HAVE A PARTICULAR PURPOSE

01:09:21.223 --> 01:09:22.892
FOR THIS FIND AND IF THERE

01:09:22.958 --> 01:09:24.093
AREN'T SOME PARAMETERS.

01:09:24.159 --> 01:09:26.195
THEN IT BASICALLY REALLY AND HE

01:09:26.262 --> 01:09:27.630
HAS A DIFFERENT TITLE THAT FALLS

01:09:27.696 --> 01:09:29.131
INTO THE WASH.

01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:30.466
AND AT LEAST IN.

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:35.204
MY MIND AND CERTAINLY ARE --

01:09:35.271 --> 01:09:37.039
BUDGET CHAIR OF SOMEONE THE CREW --

01:09:37.106 --> 01:09:38.641
BEYOND THAT I SEE THE INNOVATOR

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:40.109
OF THE FUND THAT --

01:09:40.175 --> 01:09:41.410
IS SO SHE CAN CORRECT ME IF I

01:09:41.477 --> 01:09:42.578
MAKE ANY ERRORS --

01:09:42.645 --> 01:09:43.879
I I DO KNOW WE WE UNDERSTAND

01:09:43.946 --> 01:09:45.347
THAT BASICALLY WE HAVE A COUNTER

01:09:45.414 --> 01:09:47.449
CYCLICAL ISSUE WITH THE STATE

01:09:47.516 --> 01:09:49.151
BUDGET RATE OUR REVENUES ARE

01:09:49.218 --> 01:09:51.186
HIGHER WHEN TIMES ARE GOOD OUR

01:09:51.253 --> 01:09:51.820
NEEDS ARE GREATER WHEN TIMES ARE

01:09:51.887 --> 01:09:52.588
BAD.

01:09:52.655 --> 01:09:58.327
AND I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT --

01:09:58.394 --> 01:10:00.195
UNFORTUNATELY WHAT HAPPENS ON

01:10:00.262 --> 01:10:03.465
JERRY BROWN TALKED TWENTY EIGHT

01:10:03.532 --> 01:10:05.634
BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT --

01:10:05.701 --> 01:10:07.202
THAT OFTEN TIMES --

01:10:07.269 --> 01:10:08.537
SOCIAL SERVICES PARTICULARLY

01:10:08.604 --> 01:10:10.806
THINGS LIKE OUR EXIT CUT FIRST.

01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:14.410
RATE AND WE KNOW THAT --

01:10:14.476 --> 01:10:15.644
THAT OFFICE HE TO DEMAND GOES UP

01:10:15.711 --> 01:10:17.246
BECAUSE IF MORE PEOPLE WHO NEED

01:10:17.313 --> 01:10:18.380
THE SERVICES CAL AND I CAUGHT

01:10:18.447 --> 01:10:20.883
WORKS ARE MEDI CAL --

01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:22.418
SO I I GUESS I WOULD URGE.

01:10:22.484 --> 01:10:24.019
SOME THINKING AND CERTAINLY WE

01:10:24.086 --> 01:10:25.020
WANT TO DO THAT TO DO WITH THE

01:10:25.087 --> 01:10:27.222
WORKING TOGETHER ON TRYING TO

01:10:27.289 --> 01:10:28.891
SET SOME --

01:10:28.958 --> 01:10:31.594
PARAMETERS THAT REALLY REFLECT.

01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:32.895
THE GOALS OF THIS --

01:10:32.962 --> 01:10:33.696
AFTER THIS --

01:10:33.762 --> 01:10:36.165
SAFETY NET RESERVE AND AND AND

01:10:36.231 --> 01:10:38.233
TO ME IT WOULD BE --

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:39.635
PERHAPS SOME MORE BASED ALONG

01:10:39.702 --> 01:10:40.502
YOU DON'T EAT IT CAN INCREASE

01:10:40.569 --> 01:10:41.737
DEMAND BASED ON INCREASE

01:10:41.804 --> 01:10:43.072
ENROLLMENT RIGHT SO WHAT HAPPENS

01:10:43.138 --> 01:10:44.006
IS THAT WE HAVE FEWER PEOPLE ARE

01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:46.108
CAO WORKS BECAUSE ECONOMIES GOOD

01:10:46.175 --> 01:10:47.242
JOBS ARE OPERATE.

01:10:47.309 --> 01:10:49.278
IT GOES THE OTHER WAY AND SO AS

01:10:49.345 --> 01:10:51.146
THE NUMBERS INCREASE.

01:10:51.213 --> 01:10:55.851
WE DON'T WORK YOU KNOW FIND

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:57.286
YOURSELVES WERE BOTH CUTTING THE

01:10:57.353 --> 01:10:59.288
AMOUNT AND ONE THAT ALSO WE'D

01:10:59.355 --> 01:11:01.323
START ENGAGING AND FRANKLY --

01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:03.459
VARIOUS TACTICS TO TRY TO DRIVE

01:11:03.525 --> 01:11:05.461
MAKE IT HARDER FOR PEOPLE TO

01:11:05.527 --> 01:11:07.463
EVEN AND ROLE FOR THE SERVICES.

01:11:07.529 --> 01:11:08.163
LET'S JUST BE REALLY BUT WE CAME

01:11:08.230 --> 01:11:10.199
OF SOME PRETTY CRAZY IDEAS WHICH

01:11:10.265 --> 01:11:11.467
I WON'T REITERATE THAT I

01:11:11.533 --> 01:11:13.402
REMEMBER FROM THE TIME I AND I

01:11:13.469 --> 01:11:15.037
THINK A CENTER MITCHELL BOTH OF

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:16.105
US CAME TO SIMPLY AT THE SAME

01:11:16.171 --> 01:11:17.573
TIME IN.

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:18.641
TWENTY TEN AND SO WE'D LIKE TO

01:11:18.707 --> 01:11:19.308
AVOID THAT.

01:11:19.375 --> 01:11:20.409
RIGHT -- WE

01:11:20.476 --> 01:11:22.378
WE WE WE WHEN PEOPLE NEED THE

01:11:22.444 --> 01:11:23.912
PROGRAM IS NOT WHEN WE SHOULD BE

01:11:23.979 --> 01:11:25.581
THROWING UP MORE BARRIERS RIGHT

01:11:25.648 --> 01:11:27.049
SO WE SHOULD SO. TO ME IN MY

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:28.417
MIND WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT

01:11:28.484 --> 01:11:29.518
SOME PARAMETERS BASED ON IT

01:11:29.585 --> 01:11:31.153
AGAIN WE SEE LARGER NUMBERS OF

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:32.688
PEOPLE NEEDING TO SIGN UP FOR

01:11:32.755 --> 01:11:34.657
THESE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE

01:11:34.723 --> 01:11:36.425
RESERVED ALLOW US TO MAINTAIN

01:11:36.492 --> 01:11:37.092
THAT.

01:11:37.159 --> 01:11:41.430
THAT LEVEL OF YOU KNOW SERVICE --

01:11:41.497 --> 01:11:42.631
TO TO TO TO THOSE FOLKS SO --

01:11:42.698 --> 01:11:44.133
ABOUT HOPING THAT THAT THE

01:11:44.199 --> 01:11:45.968
FINANCE WILL WORK WITH US IS

01:11:46.035 --> 01:11:47.336
ONLY ONE LA AS ASSISTANCE AS

01:11:47.403 --> 01:11:47.836
WELL.

01:11:47.903 --> 01:11:49.405
IN TRYING TO SET SOME PARAMETERS

01:11:49.471 --> 01:11:51.907
BECAUSE I APPRECIATE FLEXIBILITY

01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:54.810
BUTIT WE AND I APPRECIATE AGAIN

01:11:54.877 --> 01:11:55.744
I WANT THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR

01:11:55.811 --> 01:11:57.513
PUTTING IN YOU KNOW MAKING THE

01:11:57.579 --> 01:11:58.247
SUBSTANTIAL COMMITMENT TO THE

01:11:58.313 --> 01:11:59.014
STATE THAT RESERVE.

01:11:59.081 --> 01:12:02.418
BUT IF THE STATEMENT RESERVE

01:12:02.484 --> 01:12:04.520
DOESN'T HAVE SOME.

01:12:04.586 --> 01:12:05.387
PARAMETERS AND CONCEPTS THAT WE

01:12:05.454 --> 01:12:06.388
UNDERSTOOD WE COMMONLY

01:12:06.455 --> 01:12:07.456
UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS IS FOR I'M

01:12:07.523 --> 01:12:08.490
AFRAID THE NEXT RECESSION IT

01:12:08.557 --> 01:12:10.959
BECOMES JUST PART OF THE WASH SO.

01:12:11.026 --> 01:12:12.594
YES THE TWO QUICK POINTS ON THAT

01:12:12.661 --> 01:12:13.996
FIRST I WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:12:14.063 --> 01:12:15.497
BECAUSE I KNOW I MENTIONED THE

01:12:15.564 --> 01:12:16.832
WORD FLEXIBILITY BUT THE SAFETY

01:12:16.899 --> 01:12:18.400
NET RESERVE A SEAT FOR CAL WORKS

01:12:18.467 --> 01:12:19.334
AND IT'S FOR MEDI CAL.

01:12:19.401 --> 01:12:20.836
NOT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS AND I

01:12:20.903 --> 01:12:21.437
JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THAT

01:12:21.503 --> 01:12:24.707
IS THE THE PURPOSE WHY THE

01:12:24.773 --> 01:12:25.941
SAFETY NET RESERVE WAS CREATED

01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:27.543
IN AS YOU NOTED WITH THE RAINY

01:12:27.609 --> 01:12:28.610
DAY FUND.

01:12:28.677 --> 01:12:30.879
FROM POP TO THAT IS MORE MUCH

01:12:30.946 --> 01:12:32.581
MORE GENERAL AND THERE ARE

01:12:32.648 --> 01:12:33.182
RESTRICTIONS ON IT YOU KNOW.

01:12:33.248 --> 01:12:35.084
NO MORE THAN 50% IN THE FIRST

01:12:35.150 --> 01:12:36.218
YEAR CAN BE DEPOSITED IN A

01:12:36.285 --> 01:12:38.387
BUDGET EMERGENCY FROM THE RAINY

01:12:38.454 --> 01:12:39.455
DAY FUND INTO THE GENERAL FUND

01:12:39.521 --> 01:12:40.989
BUT THAT IS FOR EVERYTHING BUT

01:12:41.056 --> 01:12:42.191
WE'RE WELL AWARE OF THAT

01:12:42.257 --> 01:12:43.092
HISTORY'S WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:12:43.158 --> 01:12:44.393
THAT -- THIS

01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:46.528
FUNDING IS JUST FOR THOSE TWO

01:12:46.595 --> 01:12:48.664
PROGRAMS OKAY.

01:12:48.731 --> 01:12:50.866
OKAY SO.

01:12:50.933 --> 01:12:51.433
LET'S HAVE THAT CONVERSATION

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:54.203
ACTION THAT YOU BELIEVE ME AS A

01:12:54.269 --> 01:12:55.671
SUMMER DECISION TAKEN MEDI CAL A

01:12:55.738 --> 01:12:57.005
SOURCE CARE ABOUT MEDI CAL BUT I

01:12:57.072 --> 01:12:57.573
THINK CAL WORKS EVEN MORE

01:12:57.639 --> 01:12:59.041
VULNERABLE YES SO LET'S HAVE

01:12:59.108 --> 01:12:59.842
THAT DISCUSSION --

01:12:59.908 --> 01:13:00.442
THE SECOND THING I WANT TO

01:13:00.509 --> 01:13:02.511
MENTION IS I APPRECIATE THE LA

01:13:02.578 --> 01:13:03.011
JOH.

01:13:03.078 --> 01:13:04.446
AS AGAIN ACTUAL PUSHING

01:13:04.513 --> 01:13:05.814
FLEXIBILITY I ACTUALLY SUPPORT

01:13:05.881 --> 01:13:07.116
THE IDEA OF LET'S PAY OFF THOSE

01:13:07.182 --> 01:13:08.784
DEBTS THE SPECIAL FUNDS LET'S

01:13:08.851 --> 01:13:10.686
GET RID OF THE FOR ALL RIGHT --

01:13:10.753 --> 01:13:12.421
AND TO TELL THE PEOPLE

01:13:12.488 --> 01:13:14.389
CALIFORNIA LOOK WE'VE ON WILD

01:13:14.456 --> 01:13:16.558
ALL THESE THINGS DOWN THEN AGAIN

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:17.192
THEY HAVE BECOME PART OF THE

01:13:17.259 --> 01:13:18.727
TOOL BOX IN CASE WE DO HAVE TO

01:13:18.794 --> 01:13:20.996
DEAL WITH A SEVERE RECESSION.

01:13:21.063 --> 01:13:22.364
BUT I I DO --

01:13:22.431 --> 01:13:23.999
ONE OF I DO I MENTION THE POINT

01:13:24.066 --> 01:13:25.067
THOUGH AND I AND I GET ALSO

01:13:25.134 --> 01:13:26.068
APPRECIATE THE CONTRIBUTION TO

01:13:26.135 --> 01:13:27.302
CALPERS.

01:13:27.369 --> 01:13:32.641
BUT THIS IDEA THAT THE TO THE

01:13:32.708 --> 01:13:34.209
SAME WAY THAT WE HALF THE

01:13:34.276 --> 01:13:37.913
SPECIAL THAT'S A GOOD IDEA AND

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:38.981
IT BENEFITS THE SPECIAL FUNDS

01:13:39.047 --> 01:13:40.449
THAT THEY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED

01:13:40.516 --> 01:13:42.117
LOANS TO THE SPECIAL FUNDS THAT.

01:13:42.184 --> 01:13:43.786
WHEN -- THAT

01:13:43.852 --> 01:13:45.320
IF IT THERE'S AN ISSUE THAT WE

01:13:45.387 --> 01:13:47.122
GET PAID BACK EVENTUALLY FOR

01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:48.857
THOSE -- AND

01:13:48.924 --> 01:13:50.425
IS IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE

01:13:50.492 --> 01:13:51.894
THEY'LL SPECIAL FUNDS LOAN TO US

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.362
WHEN WE NEEDED THEM BECAUSE THEY

01:13:53.428 --> 01:13:54.596
HAD SOME OF THOSE POTS OF MONEY

01:13:54.663 --> 01:13:56.331
AVAILABLE WHEN WE NEED TO HELP

01:13:56.398 --> 01:13:57.733
BRIDGE A RECESSION SO.

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:59.568
I WANT YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THIS --

01:13:59.635 --> 01:14:01.370
CONCEPT THAT WAS BROUGHT UP THAT

01:14:01.436 --> 01:14:03.105
THE AB AND I THINK IT'S A GOOD

01:14:03.172 --> 01:14:04.706
IDEA THAT WE DO MAKE THESE

01:14:04.773 --> 01:14:06.241
PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS BUT THAT.

01:14:06.308 --> 01:14:07.176
TO PROVIDE ACTUALLY TO INCREASE

01:14:07.242 --> 01:14:09.578
OUR LONG TERM FLEXIBILITY IN

01:14:09.645 --> 01:14:11.113
TERMS OF OF WHAT YOU KNOW WE

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:12.014
BORROW FOR THEM SOMETIMES WE

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:13.882
NEED BUT VICE VERSA I LIKE WE'RE

01:14:13.949 --> 01:14:15.050
HELPING THEM AND IT'S IT IS A

01:14:15.117 --> 01:14:17.486
NET BENEFIT STILL TO THE SPECIAL

01:14:17.553 --> 01:14:18.987
FUNDS THAT WE DOING THIS FOR

01:14:19.054 --> 01:14:19.555
THEM.

01:14:19.621 --> 01:14:20.189
SO WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT

01:14:20.255 --> 01:14:22.324
YES SO BASICALLY WHEN WE WHEN

01:14:22.391 --> 01:14:23.225
THE GOVERNOR PUT TOGETHER THE

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:25.694
PROPOSAL TEAM WANTED TO SAVE

01:14:25.761 --> 01:14:26.662
TAXPAYERS MONEY AND SAVE OUR

01:14:26.728 --> 01:14:28.063
STATE MONEY AND HE WAS THINKING

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:28.864
OF THAT.

01:14:28.931 --> 01:14:29.932
ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL FUND

01:14:29.998 --> 01:14:31.133
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WHEN YOU

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:32.868
THINK ABOUT THE BIG THREE TAXES

01:14:32.935 --> 01:14:34.069
THAT'S WHERE THEY FLOW INTO

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:35.504
VERSUS SPECIAL UNDS WHICH ARE

01:14:35.571 --> 01:14:37.072
MOSTLY FUNDED BY FEES AND OTHER

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:37.840
CONSIDERATIONS.

01:14:37.906 --> 01:14:39.741
SO THAT IS OUR INTENT --

01:14:39.808 --> 01:14:43.312
WE ARE STILL STRUCK SO THE LA OF

01:14:43.378 --> 01:14:46.114
THE I AGREE WITH WHEN IT COMES

01:14:46.181 --> 01:14:48.984
TO STRUCTURING THAT IT'S A

01:14:49.051 --> 01:14:51.019
LITTLE BIT COMPLICATED BECAUSE

01:14:51.086 --> 01:14:52.554
AS MISS ALWAYS HAD MENTIONED

01:14:52.621 --> 01:14:53.388
ENOUGH.

01:14:53.455 --> 01:14:54.590
FOR THE C. H. P. IT'S ALL FUNDED

01:14:54.656 --> 01:14:55.858
BY SPECIAL FINE WITH THE MOTOR

01:14:55.924 --> 01:14:56.959
VEHICLE ACCOUNT BUT FOR OTHER

01:14:57.025 --> 01:14:58.026
FUNDS THERE'S A DIFFERENT

01:14:58.093 --> 01:14:59.194
PROPORTION FOR EACH.

01:14:59.261 --> 01:15:00.295
SO THAT SOMETHING IN THE WEEKS

01:15:00.362 --> 01:15:01.363
AND MONTHS TO COME WE'RE GOING

01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:02.898
TO WORK ON THAT MECHANISM BUT

01:15:02.965 --> 01:15:04.433
THE INTENTION IS FOR THOSE

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.668
PAYMENTS TO BE MADE ON BEHALF OF

01:15:06.735 --> 01:15:07.202
THE GENERAL FUND.

01:15:07.269 --> 01:15:07.769
OKAY.

01:15:07.836 --> 01:15:09.171
ALL RIGHT AND THEN --

01:15:09.238 --> 01:15:11.907
FINALLY --

01:15:11.974 --> 01:15:13.342
SO IF YOU'VE PREVIOUSLY CHAIR

01:15:13.408 --> 01:15:14.977
TIA PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT TIME

01:15:15.043 --> 01:15:15.544
ACTIVITY.

01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:18.347
APPRECIATE THE UP FRONT --

01:15:18.413 --> 01:15:19.781
BESIDE THE AGAIN PRETTY TAKING

01:15:19.848 --> 01:15:21.817
SOME OF OUR TIMES IN OUR PROCESS

01:15:21.884 --> 01:15:23.485
HAS PAYING DOWN OUR UNFUNDED

01:15:23.552 --> 01:15:26.989
LIABILITIES --

01:15:27.055 --> 01:15:28.757
IN TERMS OF OUR PENSIONS OTHER

01:15:28.824 --> 01:15:30.692
THIS IS KIND OF LIKE RIGHT SO

01:15:30.759 --> 01:15:34.263
WHAT EXPECT SOMEONE IN THEIR

01:15:34.329 --> 01:15:35.597
TWENTIES UNLESS THEY REALLY HIT

01:15:35.664 --> 01:15:37.532
IT RICH THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY

01:15:37.599 --> 01:15:38.267
HAVE FULLY FUNDED THEIR

01:15:38.333 --> 01:15:38.967
RETIREMENT.

01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:39.902
WHILE THEY'RE IN THE TWENTIES OR

01:15:39.968 --> 01:15:41.470
THIRTIES RIGHT WE WE BUILD UP

01:15:41.536 --> 01:15:42.704
TOWARD RETIREMENT PEOPLE ARE ALL

01:15:42.771 --> 01:15:45.173
RETIRING AT THE SAME TIME --

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:46.308
SO EIGHT SWIMBAIT NOTED THAT

01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:47.209
WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT FUNDED

01:15:47.276 --> 01:15:48.810
LIABILITIES --

01:15:48.877 --> 01:15:51.313
THE THE OTHER THING IN BUT I I

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:53.181
GUESS ONE OF THE THINGS I JUST

01:15:53.248 --> 01:15:55.017
WANT TO TOUCH ON IS I KNOW WHEN

01:15:55.083 --> 01:15:56.285
YOU'RE DOING THIS STUFF CASTING

01:15:56.351 --> 01:15:58.020
MODELING.

01:15:58.086 --> 01:15:59.521
IN MANY WAYS WHAT WE DO IS.

01:15:59.588 --> 01:16:00.355
WELL WE CAN PICK OUT NUMBER BUT

01:16:00.422 --> 01:16:01.723
REALLY IT'S LIKE A SENSITIVITY

01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:05.327
ANALYSIS RIGHT AND SO --

01:16:05.394 --> 01:16:07.029
SO IN TERMS OF THE AND

01:16:07.095 --> 01:16:09.464
INVESTMENT WHAT'S THE WHAT WOULD

01:16:09.531 --> 01:16:10.899
BE BAYSIDE SO CASTING MOLLY

01:16:10.966 --> 01:16:11.934
MAYBE OUT OF THE OF NUMBER FRONT

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:12.634
OF YOU.

01:16:12.701 --> 01:16:13.602
THE PROBABILITY IN WHICH

01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:15.270
ACTUALLY WEWOULD HAVE A

01:16:15.337 --> 01:16:18.273
POSITIVE SAVINGS --

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:19.908
FOR THE UP FRONT MONEY THAT WE

01:16:19.975 --> 01:16:20.909
PUT IN SO WE'RE PROJECTING THAT

01:16:20.976 --> 01:16:22.344
ON AVERAGE SHE SAID FIFTY

01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:24.813
PERCENTILE SIX POINT TWO BILLION --

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:27.049
BUT SOME PEOPLE SAY WLL THERE'S

01:16:27.115 --> 01:16:28.784
POSSIBLY YOU KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW

01:16:28.850 --> 01:16:29.518
WHAT HAPPENED THAT TO THE

01:16:29.584 --> 01:16:31.253
ECONOMY THAT MAY BE A LITTLE BIT

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:32.587
Là SO WHAT KIND OF PERCENT SO

01:16:32.654 --> 01:16:34.122
WHAT CAP PERCENTAGE ARE WE

01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:35.624
LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF

01:16:35.691 --> 01:16:37.292
PROBABILITY OF AGAIN THESE ARE

01:16:37.359 --> 01:16:38.260
ALL PROBABILITIES WE CAN'T

01:16:38.327 --> 01:16:38.527
PREDICT.

01:16:38.593 --> 01:16:42.030
THE FUTURE --

01:16:42.097 --> 01:16:43.932
THAT MOVING FORWARD OBVIOUSLY

01:16:43.999 --> 01:16:47.469
VERY REMOTE THEY'RE ALL*

01:16:47.536 --> 01:16:48.403
SAVING STILL AT THAT POINT

01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:50.872
ANOTHER TO GREATER THAN 99%

01:16:50.939 --> 01:16:53.075
CHANCE THAT WE'LL STATUS. THIRTY

01:16:53.141 --> 01:16:55.444
YEARS THAT'S RIGHT YEARS OKAY

01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:58.747
THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW THANK YOU.

01:16:58.814 --> 01:16:59.881
FRESH.

01:16:59.948 --> 01:17:01.149
FORGOT TO DO IN MY TWENTIES

MONEY.

01:17:15.864 --> 01:17:16.465
HE AND THEN IT SOMEBODY BROUGHT

01:17:16.531 --> 01:17:18.800
TO MY ATTENTION THAT WE HAVE NO

01:17:18.867 --> 01:17:21.470
PENSION IS SO AND WE DON'T

01:17:21.536 --> 01:17:23.438
THAT'S WHY WE SHOULD ACTUALLY.

01:17:23.505 --> 01:17:24.840
RECORD THEN OF THESE VOTES

01:17:24.906 --> 01:17:28.010
BENEFIT US IN ANY MANNER AT

01:17:28.076 --> 01:17:32.114
SURVIVOR THAT'S RIGHT SENATOR

01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:34.349
MODERATE --

01:17:34.416 --> 01:17:35.884
SO PICKING UP A LITTLE BIT ON

01:17:35.951 --> 01:17:37.319
SENATOR PAM I THINK TO THE LA --

01:17:37.386 --> 01:17:38.620
FIRST AND THEN.

01:17:38.687 --> 01:17:40.655
OTHERS AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE.

01:17:40.722 --> 01:17:42.357
THREE THE OPTIONS YOU FRAMED WE

01:17:42.424 --> 01:17:43.558
COULD PUT MORE IN CASH RESERVE

01:17:43.625 --> 01:17:44.526
AND THEN IT SEEMED LIKE THAT WAS

01:17:44.593 --> 01:17:45.660
KIND OF JUXTAPOSED. TO PUTTING

01:17:45.727 --> 01:17:47.095
MORE INTO BUILDING DOWN SOME OF

01:17:47.162 --> 01:17:48.096
THESE LIABILITIES IN THE

01:17:48.163 --> 01:17:50.065
RETIREMENT PROGRAMS --

01:17:50.132 --> 01:17:51.466
IN I THINK YOU PARTIALLY

01:17:51.533 --> 01:17:54.903
ANSWERED THIS BUT IF WE IS THERE

01:17:54.970 --> 01:17:57.572
ANY HYBRID IN OTHER WORDS IF IF

01:17:57.639 --> 01:17:59.374
WE MAKE A LARGER INVESTMENT.

01:17:59.441 --> 01:18:01.243
IN PAYING DOWN THE LIABILITIES

01:18:01.309 --> 01:18:03.345
AND THE RETIREMENT FUNDS AND

01:18:03.412 --> 01:18:04.980
THEN WE HIT A RECESSION.

01:18:05.047 --> 01:18:07.249
IN THE MARKET [inaudible]

01:18:07.315 --> 01:18:08.550
FALLS.

01:18:08.617 --> 01:18:11.586
DO WE JEOPARDIZE HAVING FRONT

01:18:11.653 --> 01:18:12.687
LOADED --

01:18:12.754 --> 01:18:15.157
SOME OF THOSE RESOURCES VERSES

01:18:15.223 --> 01:18:17.592
IF WE PROTECTED SOME OF THEM IN.

01:18:17.659 --> 01:18:20.228
IN SAVINGS ACCOUNT SIR

01:18:20.295 --> 01:18:20.529
[inaudible]

01:18:20.595 --> 01:18:22.631
IN.

01:18:22.697 --> 01:18:25.834
MADE THAT INVESTMENT OVER TIME I

01:18:25.901 --> 01:18:27.636
KNOW EARNING LESS.

01:18:27.702 --> 01:18:29.004
BY THAT DISTRIBUTION BUT HELP ME

01:18:29.071 --> 01:18:30.906
UNDERSTAND.

01:18:30.972 --> 01:18:33.241
ACT HOW DO WE FIND THAT THAT

01:18:33.308 --> 01:18:35.744
CORRECT WERE MOST BENEFICIAL

01:18:35.811 --> 01:18:37.446
BALLOT SO START WITH LA --

01:18:37.512 --> 01:18:38.647
AND OTHERS MAY HAVE THOUGHTS ON

01:18:38.713 --> 01:18:40.148
THAT.

01:18:40.215 --> 01:18:40.849
YES SO --

01:18:40.916 --> 01:18:41.883
THIS THIS IS DEFINITELY THE

01:18:41.950 --> 01:18:44.986
TRADE OFF IS THE RISK VERSUS --

01:18:45.053 --> 01:18:47.255
REWARD OR RISK FORCES RETURN --

01:18:47.322 --> 01:18:48.190
SO.

01:18:48.256 --> 01:18:49.724
I'LL JUST MAKE A COUPLE POINTS

01:18:49.791 --> 01:18:50.826
ABOUT THIS.

01:18:50.892 --> 01:18:52.360
THIS WOULD BE THERE WOULD BE A

01:18:52.427 --> 01:18:54.096
VARIETY OF INVESTMENT STRATEGIES

01:18:54.162 --> 01:18:55.263
THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD

01:18:55.330 --> 01:18:56.798
PROBABLY TAKE WITH RESPECT TO

01:18:56.865 --> 01:18:57.833
THESE FUNDS THEY WOULD BE

01:18:57.899 --> 01:19:00.502
INVESTED MOST LIKELY IN --

01:19:00.569 --> 01:19:02.170
A TYPE OF FUND THAT WOULD EARN A

01:19:02.237 --> 01:19:04.606
LOWER RETURN THAN THE TYPICAL

01:19:04.673 --> 01:19:05.907
CALPERS INVESTMENT RETURN OF FOR

01:19:05.974 --> 01:19:08.043
THE TYPICAL ASSUMED INVESTMENT

01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:09.311
RETURN OF 7% EITHER BE A VARIETY

01:19:09.377 --> 01:19:10.345
OF STRATEGIES THAT THE

01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:11.546
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER.

01:19:11.613 --> 01:19:12.881
THAT RANGE FROM YOU KNOW HIGHER

01:19:12.948 --> 01:19:14.850
RETURN MORE RISK TO LOWERED

01:19:14.916 --> 01:19:16.485
RETURN LESS RISK ONE OF THE

01:19:16.551 --> 01:19:18.019
REASONS THAT WE BRING THIS

01:19:18.086 --> 01:19:19.621
PROPOSAL UP NOW.

01:19:19.688 --> 01:19:24.559
IS THAT BOTH STATE MIGHT HAVE

01:19:24.626 --> 01:19:27.796
NOW ACTUALLY IT DOES PROVIDE A

01:19:27.863 --> 01:19:29.764
BIT OF AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS

01:19:29.831 --> 01:19:32.134
OPTION TO BE USED --

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:33.668
MORE FLEXIBLY IN THE FUTURE AND

01:19:33.735 --> 01:19:35.403
SO BY THAT I MEAN SAY THE STATE

01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:37.506
ANSWERS A RECESSION AND TWENTY

01:19:37.572 --> 01:19:39.107
TWENTY THE CASH RESERVES COULD

01:19:39.174 --> 01:19:41.209
BE USED FIRST TO COVER A BUDGET

01:19:41.276 --> 01:19:43.211
PROBLEM WHILE FINANCIAL MARKETS

01:19:43.278 --> 01:19:44.546
ARE SUFFERING AND YOU KNOW

01:19:44.613 --> 01:19:45.881
POTENTIALLY THE VALUE OF THIS

01:19:45.947 --> 01:19:47.249
ACCOUNT IS DOWN.

01:19:47.315 --> 01:19:48.650
AND THEN SAY IN THE SECOND YEAR

01:19:48.717 --> 01:19:49.951
OF THE RECESSION ONCE FINANCIAL

01:19:50.018 --> 01:19:51.453
MARKETS HAVE RECOVERED AND

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:53.321
HOPEFULLY THE VALUE OF THIS

01:19:53.388 --> 01:19:54.623
ACCOUNT HAS RECOVERED THEN THE

01:19:54.689 --> 01:19:55.891
LEGISLATURE COULD OPT TO USE

01:19:55.957 --> 01:19:57.025
THAT -- SO

01:19:57.092 --> 01:19:58.627
PART OF THE REASON THAT WE BRING

01:19:58.693 --> 01:19:59.161
UP THIS IS BEING AN OPTION

01:19:59.227 --> 01:20:01.062
THAT'S PERHAPS MORE ATTRACTIVE

01:20:01.129 --> 01:20:03.431
NOW IS BECAUSE THE STATE HAS

01:20:03.498 --> 01:20:04.399
SOME MATCHING CASH RESERVES.

01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:06.434
THANK YOU IN.

01:20:06.501 --> 01:20:07.836
OTHERS ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT HAD

01:20:07.903 --> 01:20:10.438
HAD YOU.

01:20:10.505 --> 01:20:15.577
WHAT'S THE BEST APPORTIONMENT.

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:16.678
TO AND TO HEDGE AGAINST THE RISK

01:20:16.745 --> 01:20:20.849
OF PUTTING TOO MUCH XIN ACCOUNTS

01:20:20.916 --> 01:20:21.483
ALTHOUGH IT SOUNDED FROM THAT

01:20:21.550 --> 01:20:22.384
ANSWER.

01:20:22.450 --> 01:20:23.852
THERE'S SOME DISCRETION WITHIN

01:20:23.919 --> 01:20:26.221
THE INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS AS WELL

01:20:26.288 --> 01:20:27.556
BETWEEN HIGHER RISK IN

01:20:27.622 --> 01:20:27.856
[inaudible]

01:20:27.923 --> 01:20:30.025
IN.

01:20:30.091 --> 01:20:31.226
LOWER RISK --

01:20:31.293 --> 01:20:33.161
MORE GUARANTEED RETURN BOND

01:20:33.228 --> 01:20:35.397
MARKETS OR SOMETHING RIGHT --

01:20:35.463 --> 01:20:37.499
I THINK YOU YOU LOOKING AT YOU

01:20:37.566 --> 01:20:38.300
KNOW WE WILL KEEP IT CASH

01:20:38.366 --> 01:20:41.469
RESERVES AND HAVE A LOWER RETURN --

01:20:41.536 --> 01:20:43.205
IF YOU PUT IT IN THE WITH PREPAY

01:20:43.271 --> 01:20:44.973
RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS YOU DO

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:47.309
HAVE -- THE

01:20:47.375 --> 01:20:48.777
POTENTIAL FOR GREATER GREATER

01:20:48.843 --> 01:20:50.278
CATCH OF THE GREAT RETURNS ON

01:20:50.345 --> 01:20:52.113
THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS --

01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:54.816
THAT -- YOU

01:20:54.883 --> 01:20:55.750
THINK WELL IF IT'S AN CASH

01:20:55.817 --> 01:20:57.552
RESERVES IT'S NOT COMMITTED TO

01:20:57.619 --> 01:20:59.654
PERS IT'S COMMITTED YOU HAVE THE

01:20:59.721 --> 01:21:01.189
FLEXIBILITY FOR ANYTHING.

01:21:01.256 --> 01:21:02.657
BUT LOWER RETURNS IF YOU PUT IT

01:21:02.724 --> 01:21:04.859
IN THE IF YOU PRE PUT IN THE

01:21:04.926 --> 01:21:06.061
PREPAYMENT A CAL.

01:21:06.127 --> 01:21:07.929
IT'S BASICALLY A COMMITMENT

01:21:07.996 --> 01:21:10.732
OFFERS RITAM PENSION PLANS. FOR

01:21:10.799 --> 01:21:13.668
POTENTIAL READ REDUCTION OF YOUR

01:21:13.735 --> 01:21:15.570
REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS AT YOUR

01:21:15.637 --> 01:21:16.705
CHOOSING YOU SAW THAT

01:21:16.771 --> 01:21:18.306
FLEXIBILITY AND THEN YOU GET TO

01:21:18.373 --> 01:21:19.407
THAT THIRD OPTION WHERE YOU MAKE

01:21:19.474 --> 01:21:21.376
THAT SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT WHICH

01:21:21.443 --> 01:21:21.876
IS A ONE TIME PAYMENT.

01:21:21.943 --> 01:21:23.511
MAKES EIGHT EIGHT LIKE A

01:21:23.578 --> 01:21:26.715
PERMANENT REDUCTION.

01:21:26.781 --> 01:21:27.349
IN THE CONTRIBUTION RATE GOING

01:21:27.415 --> 01:21:28.149
FORWARD.

01:21:28.216 --> 01:21:29.784
BUT YOU'LL HAVE A MORE FLEXIBLY

01:21:29.851 --> 01:21:31.519
AT THAT AT THAT POINT WE MAKE IT --

01:21:31.586 --> 01:21:33.855
WE WE ADJUST THE RATES AT THAT

01:21:33.922 --> 01:21:34.222
POINT AND THEN.

01:21:34.289 --> 01:21:37.392
HE IF.

01:21:37.459 --> 01:21:38.393
YOU KNOW RECESSION WHERE THE

01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:39.594
CRACKER SAY SEVERAL YEARS DOWN

01:21:39.661 --> 01:21:41.863
THE ROAD.

01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:42.530
YOU.

01:21:42.597 --> 01:21:43.198
YOU YOU WOULD STILL LIKE TO MAKE

01:21:43.265 --> 01:21:44.933
THE REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS IF IT

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:45.867
WAS SET IN THE PREPAYMENT

01:21:45.934 --> 01:21:47.168
ACCOUNT YOU CAN USE THAT TO

01:21:47.235 --> 01:21:49.504
OFFSET THE REQUIRED CONRIBUTION

01:21:49.571 --> 01:21:50.472
SO IT COMES DOWN.

01:21:50.538 --> 01:21:53.808
TO THERE'S NOT A RIGHT ANSWER IT

01:21:53.875 --> 01:21:57.479
IT'S WHAT DO YOU WHAT IS BEST

01:21:57.545 --> 01:21:58.580
FOR YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION

01:21:58.647 --> 01:22:00.749
AND HE COMES DOWN TO YOUR

01:22:00.815 --> 01:22:02.517
PARTICULAR NEEDS.

01:22:02.584 --> 01:22:03.752
THANK YOU OUTS MAKE TWO POINTS

01:22:03.818 --> 01:22:05.253
IN ADDITION TO THAT --

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:06.388
THE FIRST IS THE REASON THE

01:22:06.454 --> 01:22:08.089
ADMINISTRATION FOCUSED ON MAKING

01:22:08.156 --> 01:22:09.824
A SUPPLEMENTAL CONTRIBUTION EVEN

01:22:09.891 --> 01:22:10.959
THOUGH WE KNOW REDUCES

01:22:11.026 --> 01:22:12.060
DISCRETION IS.

01:22:12.127 --> 01:22:13.895
WE REALLY WANTED TO APPLY THAT

01:22:13.962 --> 01:22:15.797
TO THE LONG TERM LIABILITY MAKE

01:22:15.864 --> 01:22:16.698
SURE THE FUNDS AND ARE THERE AS

01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:18.066
SOON AS POSSIBLE IT'S TRUE THAT

01:22:18.133 --> 01:22:19.834
THE MARKET CAN DECLINE BUT WE

01:22:19.901 --> 01:22:20.802
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO

01:22:20.869 --> 01:22:22.170
HAPPEN.

01:22:22.237 --> 01:22:24.306
AND IS ANY AND VESTING ANY

01:22:24.372 --> 01:22:24.873
PERSON GIVING GOOD INVESTING

01:22:24.939 --> 01:22:27.008
ADVICE WILL.

01:22:27.075 --> 01:22:28.443
I YOU WANT TO START EARLY AND

01:22:28.510 --> 01:22:29.210
THAT'S THE ONE THING THAT YOU

01:22:29.277 --> 01:22:30.812
CAN CONTROL WE DON'T KNOW WHERE

01:22:30.879 --> 01:22:32.247
THE MARKET IS GOING TO GO BUT WE

01:22:32.314 --> 01:22:33.214
PUT THOSE FUNDS AND AS SOON AS

01:22:33.281 --> 01:22:34.549
POSSIBLE THAT CAN MAKE A BIG

01:22:34.616 --> 01:22:35.350
DIFFERENCE.

01:22:35.417 --> 01:22:36.751
BUT THE SECOND THING I THINK

01:22:36.818 --> 01:22:38.253
PREPAYMENT IS SOMETHING THAT

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:40.355
DEFINITELY IMPROVES FLEXIBILITY

01:22:40.422 --> 01:22:41.489
AND IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING

01:22:41.556 --> 01:22:43.158
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION COULD

01:22:43.224 --> 01:22:44.459
CONSIDER IN THE YEARS TO COME.

01:22:44.526 --> 01:22:46.895
BUT EVEN THAT CAN COME AT A COST

01:22:46.961 --> 01:22:47.629
AND I KNOW --

01:22:47.696 --> 01:22:48.596
THEY SPOKE ABOUT --

01:22:48.663 --> 01:22:50.532
SOME THE COST THE OTHER COST IS

01:22:50.598 --> 01:22:51.433
ACTUALLY --

01:22:51.499 --> 01:22:53.201
IF YOU'RE PREPAYING AND THEN IN

01:22:53.268 --> 01:22:55.170
A RECESSION YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE

01:22:55.236 --> 01:22:57.238
OF THAT PREPAYMENT TO REDUCE

01:22:57.305 --> 01:22:58.873
YOUR CONTRIBUTION.

01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:01.076
THAT ALSO CAN COME OUT ACOSTA

01:23:01.142 --> 01:23:02.143
WARREN BUFFETT FAMOUS WE SAYS

01:23:02.210 --> 01:23:03.411
WHEN IT COMES TO INVESTING BE

01:23:03.478 --> 01:23:04.612
GREEDY WHEN OTHERS ARE FEARFUL

01:23:04.679 --> 01:23:05.947
YOUR FEARFUL WHEN OTHERS ARE

01:23:06.014 --> 01:23:07.015
GREEDY -- SO

01:23:07.082 --> 01:23:09.050
WHEN THE STATE IS REDUCING ITS

01:23:09.117 --> 01:23:11.353
ACTUARIAL YOU REQUIRED PAYMENT

01:23:11.419 --> 01:23:13.188
BY APPLYING A PREPAYMENT AT JUST

01:23:13.254 --> 01:23:14.789
THE POINT WHEN WE MIGHT BE AT

01:23:14.856 --> 01:23:16.191
THE BOTTOM OF THE MARKET.

01:23:16.257 --> 01:23:17.292

PAYMENTS IN BAD TIMES THOSE

01:23:29.137 --> 01:23:30.205
PAYMENTS IN BAD TIMES ARE

01:23:30.271 --> 01:23:32.307
PAINFUL FOR MAKING SURE IN A

01:23:32.374 --> 01:23:33.708
SIMILAR TO DOLLAR COST AVERAGING

01:23:33.775 --> 01:23:35.176
FOR AN INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR.

01:23:35.243 --> 01:23:36.177
THAT WE'RE GOING THROUGHOUT THE

01:23:36.244 --> 01:23:37.245
CYCLE SO THAT WE CAN TAKE

01:23:37.312 --> 01:23:40.715
ADVANTAGE OF BOTH THE TOP AND

FOR THE SCHOOLS SHARE OF CAL

01:24:33.768 --> 01:24:34.869
STAR IS THERE'S A BIT OF A

01:24:34.936 --> 01:24:36.304
COMPLICATED MECHANISM.

01:24:36.371 --> 01:24:37.806
BECAUSE WERE MAKING PAYMENTS ON

01:24:37.872 --> 01:24:38.940
BEHALF OF THE SCHOOLS THAT

01:24:39.007 --> 01:24:40.542
SCHOOLS ARE APPLYING JUST FOR

01:24:40.608 --> 01:24:42.310
THE NEXT TWO YEARS AND THE TWO

01:24:42.377 --> 01:24:43.611
REASONS THAT WE'RE DOING THAT.

01:24:43.678 --> 01:24:45.113
FUND THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS SIDE

01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:46.414
IS NUMBER ONE MAKING SURE THAT

01:24:46.481 --> 01:24:47.916
THEY DO EXPERIENCE SAVINGS IN

01:24:47.982 --> 01:24:49.250
THE NEXT TWO YEARS WE KNOW THAT

01:24:49.317 --> 01:24:50.485
OUR SCHOOLS ARE.

01:24:50.552 --> 01:24:52.420
UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE AND THE

01:24:52.487 --> 01:24:53.288
SECOND -- AS

STIRS FUNDING PLAN THAT WAS

01:24:56.024 --> 01:24:58.059
ADOPTED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN IS

01:24:58.126 --> 01:24:59.427
VERY COMPLICATED AND IT WAS

01:24:59.494 --> 01:25:01.129
ADOPTED AFTER MANY YEARS OF WORK

01:25:01.196 --> 01:25:02.230
AND SO WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE

01:25:02.297 --> 01:25:02.664
THAT.

01:25:02.730 --> 01:25:03.765
OUR FUNDING --

01:25:03.832 --> 01:25:05.166
SAVE SCHOOLS MONEY BUT IS

01:25:05.233 --> 01:25:06.267
CONSISTENT WITH THE DICTATES OF

THAT PROGRAM IN WHICH RATES FOR

01:25:08.736 --> 01:25:09.404
SCHOOLS DO NOT ACTUALLY

01:25:09.471 --> 01:25:12.006
FLUCTUATED SO I THINK AFTER

PREPAYMENT MECHANISM.

01:25:24.152 --> 01:25:25.987
DESTRUCTION QUESTION IS HOW

BUT A COUPLE YEARS AGO THE STATE

01:28:57.699 --> 01:28:58.866

01:28:58.933 --> 01:29:00.268
FIGURING OUT HOW WE CAN PRI FUND

01:29:00.334 --> 01:29:02.336
THESE OBLIGATIONS AND WHITTLE

01:29:02.403 --> 01:29:03.638

01:29:03.705 --> 01:29:06.074
THE SAME YEAR --

01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:06.941
TWENTY FORTY SIX THAT WE MISTER

WEBER MUCH FOR CAL STIRS WE HAVE

01:29:08.643 --> 01:29:10.878
THIS PLAN IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE

01:29:10.945 --> 01:29:12.980
THAT BY THAT POINT ALL BENEFITS

01:29:13.047 --> 01:29:14.215

01:29:14.282 --> 01:29:15.783
WE'RE NO LONGER PAYING ON A PAY

01:29:15.850 --> 01:29:17.118
AS YOU GO BASIS BECAUSE THOSE

01:29:17.185 --> 01:29:18.619
COSTS HAVE BEEN RISING EVERY

01:29:18.686 --> 01:29:18.820
YEAR.

01:29:18.886 --> 01:29:21.422
OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES --

01:29:21.489 --> 01:29:25.860
SO THAT'S WHY IT'S ELIGIBLE FOR

01:29:25.927 --> 01:29:29.097
PROP TO FUNDING TRUST --

01:29:29.163 --> 01:29:29.831
FOR PAD --

01:29:29.897 --> 01:29:31.232

REMEMBER TWO YEARS AGO WHEN WE

01:29:39.841 --> 01:29:41.275
TOOK OUT THAT LOAN --

01:29:41.342 --> 01:29:43.010
TO PUT IN SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT

01:29:43.077 --> 01:29:44.412

WE HAVE TO REPAY THAT LOAN --

01:29:47.849 --> 01:29:48.816
THAT WE TOOK OUT FROM OUR

01:29:48.883 --> 01:29:50.551
SURPLUS MONEY INVESTMENT FUND SO

01:29:50.618 --> 01:29:52.420
THAT ALSO IS ELIGIBLE UNDER PROP

01:29:52.487 --> 01:29:53.955
TO SIT WE LOOK AT THAT AS A

01:29:54.021 --> 01:29:55.523
CENTURY OR CALPERS PAYMENT

01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:56.591

01:29:58.993 --> 01:30:01.295
PLACE SO THAT ARE YOU GETTING

01:30:01.362 --> 01:30:03.131
LKE AT A BANK TO FOR YOUR BUCK

01:30:03.197 --> 01:30:03.765

TWO RESERVES BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY

01:30:07.735 --> 01:30:09.103
PUTTING IT INTO.

01:30:09.170 --> 01:30:10.438
THESE RETIREMENT DEBTS.

01:30:10.505 --> 01:30:11.439
BUT WE HAVE TO PAY BACK.

01:30:11.506 --> 01:30:12.673
PROP TWO FOR WHAT WE'RE PUTTING

01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:14.842
INTO SO FOR THAT LAST PART THAT

01:30:14.909 --> 01:30:16.144
WAS A DECISION THAT THAT

01:30:16.210 --> 01:30:16.744
GOVERNOR BROWN IN THE

01:30:16.811 --> 01:30:18.646
LEGISLATURE MAY TWO YEARS AGO --

01:30:18.713 --> 01:30:20.414
SO I ACTUALLYDON'T KNOW HOW

01:30:20.481 --> 01:30:22.083
IT'S WORKING OUT YOU KNOW RIGHT

01:30:22.150 --> 01:30:22.750

SEVEN THE WISDOM IN HIND SIGHT

01:30:28.823 --> 01:30:30.124
OF THAT DECISION WILL BE

01:30:30.191 --> 01:30:30.958
DETERMINED YOU KNOW OVER THE

01:30:31.025 --> 01:30:32.126
NEXT COUPLE YEARS OVER THE

01:30:32.193 --> 01:30:32.693
LONGER.

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:34.195
TERM -- BUT

01:30:34.262 --> 01:30:36.531
RIGHT NOW THEY MADE THE COUNTY

01:30:36.597 --> 01:30:38.499
SHORT TERM COST OF BORROWING

01:30:38.566 --> 01:30:40.268
FROM THOSE FINES AND THE LONG

01:30:40.334 --> 01:30:41.869
TERM RETURN RATE ASSUME THAT

01:30:41.936 --> 01:30:44.272
ABOUT 7% WAS LARGE ENOUGH TO

01:30:44.338 --> 01:30:45.606
JUSTIFY MAKING THAT ONCE AND NOW

01:30:45.673 --> 01:30:47.675
WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF PAYING

01:30:47.742 --> 01:30:49.710
THAT BACK OVER SEVERAL YEARS.

01:30:49.777 --> 01:30:50.578
HE BEEN --

01:30:50.645 --> 01:30:51.512
NEXT QUESTION WOULD BE WITH THE

01:30:51.579 --> 01:30:53.047
I. CALPERS. THREE BILLION TO

01:30:53.114 --> 01:30:54.982
CALPERS BUT SEVEN HUNDRED

01:30:55.049 --> 01:30:56.951
MILLION TO LOWER THE SCHOOL

01:30:57.018 --> 01:30:59.387
DISTRICT PAYMENTS.

01:30:59.453 --> 01:31:00.955
SO IN THE LAST MONTH.

01:31:01.022 --> 01:31:02.723
WE'VE SEEN LAUSD.

01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:04.992
DEMAND A 6% PAY INCREASE.

01:31:05.059 --> 01:31:06.761
WE NOW HAVE OAKLAND UNIFIED THAT

01:31:06.828 --> 01:31:08.596
WANTS TO CONSIDER GOING ON

01:31:08.663 --> 01:31:10.464
STRIKE PER PAY INCREASE.

01:31:10.531 --> 01:31:12.600
AND WE GET SACRAMENTO CITY

01:31:12.667 --> 01:31:14.268
SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT'S HAVING.

01:31:14.335 --> 01:31:15.703
A CASH FLOW PROBLEMS MAY BE OUT

01:31:15.770 --> 01:31:17.939
OF CASH ON NOVEMBER.

01:31:18.005 --> 01:31:18.840
SO.

01:31:18.906 --> 01:31:20.308
WE STEP IN AS A STATE AND SAY

01:31:20.374 --> 01:31:21.843

YOUR PAYMENTS.

01:31:24.545 --> 01:31:26.547
BUT IF THAT JUST TRANSLATES INTO

01:31:26.614 --> 01:31:29.016
A PAY RAISE.

01:31:29.083 --> 01:31:29.951
I'M A PICK ON THE TEACHERS I'M

01:31:30.017 --> 01:31:32.019
JUST DOING THE MATH HERE IF THAT

01:31:32.086 --> 01:31:34.121
MEANS THAT WE'RE GONNA.

01:31:34.188 --> 01:31:35.556
PROVIDE THEM THE THE JUST A

01:31:35.623 --> 01:31:36.791
LITTLE BIT OF ROOM TO GET A

01:31:36.858 --> 01:31:38.392
RAISE WHICH WHEN YOU GIVE A

01:31:38.459 --> 01:31:40.361
REYES NOW ADDS TO THE PENSION

01:31:40.428 --> 01:31:41.729
PROBLEM BECAUSE NOW YOU'RE GONNA.

01:31:41.796 --> 01:31:44.465
HAVE TO FUND FOR A HIGHER SALARY --

01:31:44.532 --> 01:31:46.601
HOW DO WE?

01:31:46.667 --> 01:31:48.069
HOW WE PUT A PROVISO ON ON YOUR

01:31:48.135 --> 01:31:51.505
SMART MOVE? TO PREPAY AND REDUCE

01:31:51.572 --> 01:31:53.074
FUTURE COSTS WHEN ALLWE'RE

01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:56.844
DOING IS SHIFTING IT TO A NEW.

01:31:56.911 --> 01:31:58.112
POTENTIAL COST I'M.

01:31:58.179 --> 01:31:59.280
RETURNING I'M JUST SAYING THIS

01:31:59.347 --> 01:32:00.615
BASED ON WHAT WE'RE WATCHING YOU

01:32:00.681 --> 01:32:01.349
KNOW.

01:32:01.415 --> 01:32:02.750
HAPPENING IN THE IN THE STATE

01:32:02.817 --> 01:32:04.485
WITH SOME OF OUR BIGGEST.

01:32:04.552 --> 01:32:05.319
SCHOOL DISTRICT BUT ALSO SOME OF

01:32:05.386 --> 01:32:09.957
OUR IN MOST FISCAL CRISIS SCHOOL

01:32:10.024 --> 01:32:12.627
DISTRICTS.

01:32:12.693 --> 01:32:14.362
TO YES ALL MAKE TWO POINTS ON

01:32:14.428 --> 01:32:15.663
THAT THE FIRST IS THE VERY BROAD

01:32:15.730 --> 01:32:16.864
POINT IN TERMS OF THE GOVERNOR'S

01:32:16.931 --> 01:32:17.965
INTENT --

01:32:18.032 --> 01:32:18.966
THIS WAS AWAY BECAUSE WE KNOW A

01:32:19.033 --> 01:32:19.834
LOT OF THESE DISTRICTS INCLUDING

01:32:19.901 --> 01:32:21.168
VERY LARGE DISTRICTS ARE

01:32:21.235 --> 01:32:23.237
STRUGGLING WITH THE COSTS WITH

01:32:23.304 --> 01:32:24.405
THESE RISING FIXED COSTS THAT

01:32:24.472 --> 01:32:25.506
THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY

01:32:25.573 --> 01:32:27.008
DISCRETION OVER SO.

01:32:27.074 --> 01:32:28.542
THIS WAS A WAY TO ENSURE THAT

01:32:28.609 --> 01:32:30.244
THEY HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL

01:32:30.311 --> 01:32:31.379
BREATHING ROOM --

01:32:31.445 --> 01:32:34.315
AND I THINK IN THE CASE OF LAUSD

01:32:34.382 --> 01:32:36.150
OVER THREE HUNDRED FROM THE TOP

01:32:36.217 --> 01:32:37.351
THAT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY NOT

01:32:37.418 --> 01:32:38.152
MILLION DOLLAR MARKET WE ARE

01:32:38.219 --> 01:32:39.220
ESTIMATING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

01:32:39.287 --> 01:32:40.688
OF FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS.

01:32:40.755 --> 01:32:42.657
OUT WITHOUT RAISING THAT PROP

01:32:42.723 --> 01:32:43.824
NINETY EIGHT BASE WHICH WE KNOW

01:32:43.891 --> 01:32:45.092
IN AN EMERGENCY YOU KNOW THAT

01:32:45.159 --> 01:32:46.827
COULD COMPOUND THE ISSUES THAT

01:32:46.894 --> 01:32:48.262
WE'RE DEALING WITH AND INCLUDING

01:32:48.329 --> 01:32:49.163
THAT.

01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:52.800
CAL WORK SINCE EIGHTEEN EVERITT

01:32:52.867 --> 01:32:53.434
IS TAKING A RESERVE IN MEDI CAL

01:32:53.501 --> 01:32:56.570
WE WANT BUT ON THE MORE SPECIFIC

01:32:56.637 --> 01:32:58.072
POINT THAT YOU RAISE THE WAY

01:32:58.139 --> 01:32:59.006
THAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS

01:32:59.073 --> 01:33:00.274
AND MISTER LAMBERT CAN WAY AND

01:33:00.341 --> 01:33:01.609
ALSO IS.

01:33:01.676 --> 01:33:03.044
THIS IS TO HELP --

01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:04.211
ADDRESS THE SCHOOLS AND THE

01:33:04.278 --> 01:33:05.813
UNFUNDED LIABILITY FOR CAL STIRS

01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:07.481
BY GIVING THEM SOME RELIEF BUT

01:33:07.548 --> 01:33:09.550
IN TERMS OF THE ADDITIONAL RACES

01:33:09.617 --> 01:33:11.385
AND YOU KNOW IF IF IF TEACHERS

01:33:11.452 --> 01:33:12.353
GOT ADDITIONAL RAISES ARE.

01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:14.455
COSTS GOING FORWARD I BELIEVE

01:33:14.522 --> 01:33:15.556
AND MISTER LAMBERT CAN CORRECT

01:33:15.623 --> 01:33:17.158
ME I BELIEVE FOR EMPLOYEES GOING

01:33:17.224 --> 01:33:19.627
FORWARD FOR TEACHERS --

01:33:19.694 --> 01:33:20.628
THESE RATES ARE SET IN STATUTE

01:33:20.695 --> 01:33:21.429
BUT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO

01:33:21.495 --> 01:33:24.532
FLUCTUATE BASED ON NORMAL COST --

01:33:24.598 --> 01:33:26.534
SO IF YOU TAKE TE ASSUMPTION

01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:27.568
FOR TEACHERS GOING FORWARD AND

01:33:27.635 --> 01:33:29.103
GO AND THIS IS FOR NEW TEACHERS

01:33:29.170 --> 01:33:31.105
AT FACE VALUE DAN --

01:33:31.172 --> 01:33:32.807
IF THAT 7% INVESTMENT RETURN

01:33:32.873 --> 01:33:35.276
RATE IS TO DECLINE AND THE

01:33:35.343 --> 01:33:36.844
CALPERS CASTERS BORDER TO MAKE A

01:33:36.911 --> 01:33:38.446
DETERMINATION THAT WE SHOULD

01:33:38.512 --> 01:33:39.213
ASSUME LESS THAN 7%.

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:40.514
THEN THE CONTRIBUTION RATE OF

01:33:40.581 --> 01:33:42.683
TEACHERS WOULD ACTUALLY GO UP --

01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:44.552
I SHOULD CLARIFY THAT I BELIEVE

01:33:44.618 --> 01:33:46.787
THIS APPLIES TO NEWER EMPLOYEES

01:33:46.854 --> 01:33:48.322
SCENE OF WHICH I AM ONE OF

01:33:48.389 --> 01:33:49.690
MYSELF YOU KNOW FOR STATE

01:33:49.757 --> 01:33:50.191
EMPLOYEE.

01:33:50.257 --> 01:33:51.826
FROM PLEASE PLACE AFTER TWENTY

01:33:51.892 --> 01:33:52.860
THIRTEEN WHERE IT CAN FLUCTUATE

01:33:52.927 --> 01:33:54.428
BASED ON NORMAL COST FOR THOSE

01:33:54.495 --> 01:33:56.497
PRECEDING EMPLOYEES IT WOULD BE

01:33:56.564 --> 01:33:57.798
BASED ON BARGAINING SO THERE'S

01:33:57.865 --> 01:33:59.734
NO SIMPLE ANSWER TO THAT.

01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:01.702
POINT YOU RAISE IT'S A MIX OF

01:34:01.769 --> 01:34:03.270
TWO DIFFERENT CONSIDERATIONS NOW

01:34:03.337 --> 01:34:04.438
I JUST DON'T WANT THE WISDOM OF

01:34:04.505 --> 01:34:05.206
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WHAT

01:34:05.272 --> 01:34:06.941
THE GOVERNOR'S TRYING TO DO ALL

01:34:07.008 --> 01:34:07.274
OF A SUDDEN.

01:34:07.341 --> 01:34:08.109
BE.

01:34:08.175 --> 01:34:10.011
OFFSET BY OTHER AGENDAS WHICH I

01:34:10.077 --> 01:34:11.612
APPRECIATE BECAUSE I HAVE A

01:34:11.679 --> 01:34:12.813
BROTHER WHO'S A SCHOOL TEACHER

01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:18.986
SO I I GET ALL THIS --

01:34:19.053 --> 01:34:20.588
BUT WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT.

01:34:20.654 --> 01:34:24.458
RAINY DAY.

01:34:24.525 --> 01:34:25.092
FOR AND SO I'M WONDERING IF THE

01:34:25.159 --> 01:34:26.093
GOVERNOR.

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:27.628
CONSIDERING SOME OF THE THAT THE

01:34:27.695 --> 01:34:28.262
PLIGHTS OF SOME OF THE SCHOOL

01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:29.764
DISTRICTS WHETHER WE SHOULD BE

01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:31.499
MAKING A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT TO

01:34:31.565 --> 01:34:32.800
THAT FUND.

01:34:32.867 --> 01:34:35.169
AHEAD OF THE FORMULA TO BE

01:34:35.236 --> 01:34:36.404
PREPARED FOR WHAT ROOM BECAUSE

01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:38.406
OF LA UNIFIED COMES KNOCKING ON

01:34:38.472 --> 01:34:40.074
YOUR DOOR.

01:34:40.141 --> 01:34:43.344
THEY NEED TEN BILLION DOLLARS

01:34:43.411 --> 01:34:43.978
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN WHERE DOES

01:34:44.045 --> 01:34:44.779
THAT COME FROM.

01:34:44.845 --> 01:34:45.613
I KNOW THAT'S A DIFFICULT

01:34:45.679 --> 01:34:46.247
QUESTION SO I WILL SAY YOU KNOW

01:34:46.313 --> 01:34:48.249
HERE WE WANTED TO MAKE THE

01:34:48.315 --> 01:34:49.417
PAYMENTS INTO THAT.

01:34:49.483 --> 01:34:50.985
PENSION FUND BECAUSE WE KNOW

01:34:51.052 --> 01:34:52.386
THAT THAT THE SAVINGS WILL

01:34:52.453 --> 01:34:54.121
COMPOUND OVER TIME AS SOME THE

01:34:54.188 --> 01:34:55.189
GENTLEMEN WERE MENTIONING THE

01:34:55.256 --> 01:34:55.790
OTHER THING I THINK IS WORTH

01:34:55.856 --> 01:34:57.925
NOTING IT'S NOT A SOLUTION BUT

01:34:57.992 --> 01:34:59.260
SOME THE SCHOOLS TO HAVE.

01:34:59.326 --> 01:35:01.228
RESERVE AMPLE RESERVES FOR A

01:35:01.295 --> 01:35:02.763
WEEK THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS THE

01:35:02.830 --> 01:35:03.764
ISSUE THAT WE ARE ALL DEALING

01:35:03.831 --> 01:35:04.965
WITH IS YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT

01:35:05.032 --> 01:35:06.000
LOOKING JUST FOR THIS YEAR NEXT

01:35:06.067 --> 01:35:07.201
YEAR EVEN THE YEAR AFTER WE'RE

01:35:07.268 --> 01:35:08.836
LOOKING AT THE LONG TERM.

01:35:08.903 --> 01:35:10.137
AND SO THAT'S A CONVERSATION

01:35:10.204 --> 01:35:10.971
THAT WE'RE ALL GOING TO HAVE TO

01:35:11.038 --> 01:35:11.705
HAVE.

01:35:11.772 --> 01:35:14.475
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU

01:35:14.542 --> 01:35:19.080

MANAGER --

01:35:21.882 --> 01:35:22.683
THANKS FOR THE THIRD DISCUSSION

01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:23.084
HERE.

01:35:23.150 --> 01:35:25.186
BY THE I WANTED TO GET A LITTLE

01:35:25.252 --> 01:35:26.720
DRILL DOWN A LITTLE MORE ON THE

01:35:26.787 --> 01:35:28.422
PROJECTION OF SCENARIOS FOR DOWN

01:35:28.489 --> 01:35:29.457
TICKS AND WHAT THEY MAY LOOK

01:35:29.523 --> 01:35:31.592
LIKE AN UNDERSTANDING THAT IS.

01:35:31.659 --> 01:35:33.928
SOMEWHAT OF A ROUGH SCIENCE IF

01:35:33.994 --> 01:35:35.563
NOT AN ART BUT YOU KNOW I WE WE

01:35:35.629 --> 01:35:39.834
SORT OF WE CENTRAL GAP GOING FOR

01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:41.168
I'M LOOKING HERE.

01:35:41.235 --> 01:35:42.403
WHERE?

01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:43.204
THIRTEEN EIGHTY ON THE RAINY DAY

01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:44.438
FUND SO YOU KNOW.

01:35:44.505 --> 01:35:45.840
SOMEWHERE AROUND ALMOST A THIRTY

01:35:45.906 --> 01:35:49.243
BILLION DOLLAR GAP --

01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:50.878
HI I AGE I DID WILL APPLY J.

01:35:50.945 --> 01:35:51.679
PRECIADO THE PROP TO

01:35:51.745 --> 01:35:53.080
INTERPRETATION AND I KNOW WE'VE

01:35:53.147 --> 01:35:54.582
GOT HUGE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS IN

01:35:54.648 --> 01:35:57.251
THE STATE BUT I THINK THAT --

01:35:57.318 --> 01:35:58.419
YOU KNOW THE VOTERS WHEN THEY

01:35:58.486 --> 01:36:00.354
SPOKE ABOUT THE RAINY DAY FUND

01:36:00.421 --> 01:36:01.355
THEY THEY DID WANT THAT

01:36:01.422 --> 01:36:03.023
DURABILITY IN OUR BUDGETS GOING

01:36:03.090 --> 01:36:04.692
FORWARD SO.

01:36:04.758 --> 01:36:06.460
I DO APPRECIATE THAT BUT WHAT

01:36:06.527 --> 01:36:08.062
WHY DO YOU THINK IT WILL ONLY BE

01:36:08.129 --> 01:36:10.731
LIKE THE NINETIES AND NOT WORSE

01:36:10.798 --> 01:36:12.166
LIKE WHAT'S WHAT'S THE DRIVING

01:36:12.233 --> 01:36:14.235
THAT SORT OF JUST GENERAL BALL

01:36:14.301 --> 01:36:15.669
PARKING THINKING.

01:36:15.736 --> 01:36:17.238
THAT SO IT'S ACTUALLY IT'S VERY

01:36:17.304 --> 01:36:18.873
DIFFICULT YOU KNOW TO KNOW WHAT

01:36:18.939 --> 01:36:20.374
WILL HAPPEN IS THAT WHAT WE'RE

01:36:20.441 --> 01:36:21.609
ACTUALLY MODELING AND WE'RE NOT

01:36:21.675 --> 01:36:24.011
PROJECTING IT BUT WE WANT TO RUN

01:36:24.078 --> 01:36:25.513
SCENARIO SOMEWHERE TO THE

01:36:25.579 --> 01:36:26.380
CENTERS FOR THE PENSION UNDS.

01:36:26.447 --> 01:36:27.248
IS THAT IT ACTUALLY WOULD BE

01:36:27.314 --> 01:36:29.617
WORSE THAN THE NINETEEN NINETIES --

01:36:29.683 --> 01:36:31.118
BUT BETTER THAN THE GREAT

01:36:31.185 --> 01:36:32.586
RECESSION AND WHAT'S ALL

01:36:32.653 --> 01:36:33.687
CERTAINLY HOPE IT'S WHATEVER

01:36:33.754 --> 01:36:34.421
COMES IS BETTER THAN THE GREAT

01:36:34.488 --> 01:36:35.656
RECESSION --

01:36:35.723 --> 01:36:37.391
SO WE JUST LOOKED AT THAT AS A

01:36:37.458 --> 01:36:38.726
MODERATE AND I KNOW LAOF SPOKE

01:36:38.792 --> 01:36:39.727
ABOUT MILES RECESSION IN

01:36:39.793 --> 01:36:41.595
MODERATE RECESSION WE JUST

01:36:41.662 --> 01:36:42.930
WANTED TO MODEL WHAT A MODERATE

01:36:42.997 --> 01:36:44.198
RECESSION WOULD LOOK LIKE AND

01:36:44.265 --> 01:36:45.666
THAT'S WHERE OUR ECONOMICS IN

01:36:45.733 --> 01:36:48.302
REVENUE UNIT CAME UP WITH THOSE

01:36:48.369 --> 01:36:50.738
NUMBERS.

01:36:50.804 --> 01:36:52.306
AND AND SO.

01:36:52.373 --> 01:36:53.874
IN THAT MODERNIZATION MATER

01:36:53.941 --> 01:36:54.909
RECESSION SCENARIO THOUGH WE

01:36:54.975 --> 01:36:56.877
STILL FACING A BIG GAP IN SAID

01:36:56.944 --> 01:36:57.711
THAT CONSTITUTIONAL CAP

01:36:57.778 --> 01:36:59.380
REGARDLESS HOW YOU INTERPRET.

01:36:59.446 --> 01:37:01.549
PROP TWO WE'RE STILL GONNA.

01:37:01.615 --> 01:37:04.585
HAVE TO FILL IT SOME WAY AND

01:37:04.652 --> 01:37:05.953
THAT IS CORRECT THAT'S GOING TO

01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:08.389
BE OUT OF HIS CUT ISN'T EVEN IF

01:37:08.455 --> 01:37:09.823
THIS MODERATE RECESSION WE'RE

01:37:09.890 --> 01:37:10.658
THAT ONLY HAPPENED IN THREE OR

01:37:10.724 --> 01:37:10.958
FOUR YEARS.

01:37:11.025 --> 01:37:11.625
THE RAINY DAY FUND BY THAT POINT

01:37:11.692 --> 01:37:13.494
WOULD BE ALMOST TWENTY BILLION

01:37:13.561 --> 01:37:14.562
DOLLARS WHICH IS A HUGE NUMBER

01:37:14.628 --> 01:37:17.631
BUT AS YOU NOTED SMALLER THAN

01:37:17.698 --> 01:37:18.199
THE NUMBERS YOU WERE TALKING

01:37:18.265 --> 01:37:20.234
ABOUT --

01:37:20.301 --> 01:37:22.503
THANK YOU FOR THAT --

01:37:22.570 --> 01:37:22.870
WHAT --

01:37:22.937 --> 01:37:24.004
WANTED TO ALSO LOOK AT THE THE

01:37:24.071 --> 01:37:25.539
ASSUMPTIONS SORT OF HISTORICALLY

01:37:25.606 --> 01:37:26.840
HOW THEY'VE MATCHED UP SO I KNOW

01:37:26.907 --> 01:37:29.376
WE WE WENT FROM SEVEN POINT FIVE

01:37:29.443 --> 01:37:30.711
DOWN TO SEVEN THAT ADJUSTMENT.

01:37:30.778 --> 01:37:33.547
THINK IT CASTERS AND AND CALPERS.

01:37:33.614 --> 01:37:34.215
SO.

01:37:34.281 --> 01:37:36.283
HISTORICALLY WHAT HAVE WE BEEN

01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:37.484
ACHIEVING.

01:37:37.551 --> 01:37:39.019
SORT OF HOW HOW HOW DO YOU HOW

01:37:39.086 --> 01:37:39.620
HOW DID WHAT IT WHAT IS YOUR

01:37:39.687 --> 01:37:40.454
THINKING BEHIND THOSE SORT OF

01:37:40.521 --> 01:37:43.324
ADJUSTMENTS AND ARE WE TOO HIGH

01:37:43.390 --> 01:37:47.127
TO LOW POTENTIALLY HERE --

01:37:47.194 --> 01:37:47.728
YEAH HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU GO

01:37:47.795 --> 01:37:50.130
ABOUT THAT THOUGHT THE FIRST

01:37:50.197 --> 01:37:51.765
HOUSES SOMETIME IT'S HARD TO

01:37:51.832 --> 01:37:53.601
JUST LOOK AT THE PAST BECAUSE

01:37:53.667 --> 01:37:57.805
IT'S LAKE OUR BOARD AT ALL.

01:37:57.871 --> 01:37:59.240
ALL RETIREMENT SYSTEMS WOULD BE

01:37:59.306 --> 01:38:00.908
DO NORMALLY ON A ON AN ONGOING

01:38:00.975 --> 01:38:02.576
BASIS SO VOTE CALLOUSED CALVET

01:38:02.643 --> 01:38:04.578
CULTURES AND CALPERS EVERY FOUR

01:38:04.645 --> 01:38:05.913
YEARS THE BOARD WILL LOOK AT HOW

01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:07.982
THE ASSETS ARE INVESTED TO TRY

01:38:08.048 --> 01:38:09.683
TO DETERMINE IF IT'S THE MOST

01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:11.085
APPROPRIATE WAY TO INVEST THE

01:38:11.151 --> 01:38:12.586
ASSETS GOING FORWARD AND IF.

01:38:12.653 --> 01:38:14.321
YOU LOOK HISTORICALLY.

01:38:14.388 --> 01:38:15.889
THE ASSET ALLOCATION A HOW THE

01:38:15.956 --> 01:38:18.025
ASSETS HAVE BEEN INVESTED HAS

01:38:18.092 --> 01:38:20.127
CHANGED QUITE A BIT AT LEAST FOR

01:38:20.194 --> 01:38:21.128
US IF YOU LOOK HISTORICALLY WE

01:38:21.195 --> 01:38:24.565
HAVE OUR OWN MORE THAN 7%

01:38:24.632 --> 01:38:27.768
HISTORY.

01:38:27.835 --> 01:38:30.404
HISTORICALLY BUT WHAT MATTERS

01:38:30.471 --> 01:38:32.106
MOST SOME FOR US WE ARE ABOUT TO

01:38:32.172 --> 01:38:33.007
START THIS CYCLE WHERE WE'RE

01:38:33.073 --> 01:38:33.574
GOING TO LOOK AT OUR ASSET

01:38:33.641 --> 01:38:34.808
ALLOCATION IS.

01:38:34.875 --> 01:38:35.743
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AS TO AS TO

01:38:35.809 --> 01:38:37.344
WHERE YOU ARE TODAY OW THE

01:38:37.411 --> 01:38:39.346
MARKETS AND WHAT IS THE OUTLOOK

01:38:39.413 --> 01:38:41.048
GOING FORWARD SO.

01:38:41.115 --> 01:38:42.683
THE LAST TIME WE DID IT.

01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:44.652
WE HARD INVESTMENT CONSULTANTS

01:38:44.718 --> 01:38:46.420
WE HAVE OUR OWN INTERNAL STAFF

01:38:46.487 --> 01:38:48.822
EVERYONE SAID 7% IS WHERE YOU

01:38:48.889 --> 01:38:49.957
SHOULD BE LONG TERM.

01:38:50.024 --> 01:38:51.392
BUT WE STILL BELIEVE THIS IS

01:38:51.458 --> 01:38:52.393
CORRECT --

01:38:52.459 --> 01:38:53.627
WE ARE GONNA GO THROUGH THAT

01:38:53.694 --> 01:38:56.430
PROCESS AGAIN THIS YEAR TO ROOM

01:38:56.497 --> 01:38:57.398
VALID ID TO SEE IF WE CAN

01:38:57.464 --> 01:38:59.099
VALIDATE THIS AGAIN BUT THIS IS

01:38:59.166 --> 01:39:01.435
A AN ONGOING QUESTION THAT.

01:39:01.502 --> 01:39:04.004
RETIREMENT SYSTEM HAVE TO ANSWER

01:39:04.071 --> 01:39:07.074
YOU KNOW CAN I STILL ASSUME 7%

01:39:07.141 --> 01:39:07.675
OF WHATEVER YOU'RE SOON GOING

01:39:07.741 --> 01:39:08.342
LONG TERM.

01:39:08.409 --> 01:39:11.445
THAT IT IS REALLY A SOMETIME

01:39:11.512 --> 01:39:13.914
IT'S HARD TO COMPARE ONE TION OF

01:39:13.981 --> 01:39:16.784
HOW YOU DECIDE TO INVEST YOUR

01:39:16.850 --> 01:39:18.252
ASSETS LIKE IF AS AN INDIVIDUAL

01:39:18.319 --> 01:39:19.720
YOU LOOK AT YOUR FOUR ONE K..

01:39:19.787 --> 01:39:20.721
AND YOU SAY I'M GONNA PUT

01:39:20.788 --> 01:39:22.556
EVERYTHING IN AND GOVERNMENT

01:39:22.623 --> 01:39:23.857
BONDS I THINK IT WOULD BE

01:39:23.924 --> 01:39:25.559
INAPPROPRIATE FOR YOU TO ASSUME

01:39:25.626 --> 01:39:27.961
YOU'RE GOING TO EARN 7%.

01:39:28.028 --> 01:39:29.229
RIGHT NOW THE THERE'S THEY'RE

01:39:29.296 --> 01:39:31.065
GIVING YOU 12% SO IT'S A DIRECT

01:39:31.131 --> 01:39:32.700
RELATION HOW YOU DECIDE TO

01:39:32.766 --> 01:39:34.735
INVEST THE ASSETS SO YOU KNOW IF.

01:39:34.802 --> 01:39:36.203
THIS WAS SOME TIME WHEN YOU

01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:39.273
COMPARE ONE SYSTEM TODAY. TO TO

01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:40.708
TO ANOTHER ONE IF YOU SEE ONE

01:39:40.774 --> 01:39:41.975
WITH A MUCH LOWER THAN.

01:39:42.042 --> 01:39:43.711
EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN THERE

01:39:43.777 --> 01:39:46.113
MIGHT BE A GOOD REASON BEHIND IT

01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:47.748
YOU MAY FIND OUT THAT THEY MADE

01:39:47.815 --> 01:39:49.717
A DECISION TO PUT MORE IN FIXING

01:39:49.783 --> 01:39:51.151
COMMON BONDS SO. TO FOR US WE

01:39:51.218 --> 01:39:52.886
ARE COMFORTABLE WITH OR 7% AND

01:39:52.953 --> 01:39:56.290
WE ARE GOING THROUGH THIS REVIEW

01:39:56.357 --> 01:40:01.095
AGAIN ONE MORE TIME --

01:40:01.161 --> 01:40:04.565
SIMILAR COMMENTS TO A MISTER

01:40:04.631 --> 01:40:06.333
LAMB ROLE --

01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:07.167
THREE FOUR YEARS --

01:40:07.234 --> 01:40:07.468
CALPERS --

01:40:07.534 --> 01:40:09.403
REVIEWS THEIR ASSET ALLOCATION

01:40:09.470 --> 01:40:11.205
WE LOOK AT THE WILL CALL THE

01:40:11.271 --> 01:40:12.906
CMA'S CAPITAL MARKET ASSUMPTIONS

01:40:12.973 --> 01:40:13.474
BOTH -- FOR

01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:14.308
WITH INTERNAL STAFF AS WELL AS

01:40:14.375 --> 01:40:16.310
OUTSIDE INVESTMENT CONSULTANTS

01:40:16.377 --> 01:40:17.344
AND WE MAKE A DETERMINATION ON

01:40:17.411 --> 01:40:18.479
OUR OUR EXPECTATIONS --

01:40:18.545 --> 01:40:19.179
THAT'S BASED ON THE

01:40:19.246 --> 01:40:20.214
CONSIDERATION OF THE ASSET

01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:21.148
ALLOCATION AND AS WELL AS LIKE

01:40:21.215 --> 01:40:25.018
THE RISK THAT THE THE BOARD ONCE

01:40:25.085 --> 01:40:25.452
TAKEN THE SYSTEM --

01:40:25.519 --> 01:40:28.622
IT'LL EVERYTHING IN VERY HIGH

01:40:28.689 --> 01:40:31.291
RISKY ASSETS TARGET YOUR RETURN

01:40:31.358 --> 01:40:32.626
BECAUSE SOMETIMES THOSE RETURNED

01:40:32.693 --> 01:40:34.695
STONE OCCUR AND THEN THOSE

01:40:34.762 --> 01:40:36.463
LOSSES HAVE TO BE MADE UP BY

01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:37.965
ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS.

01:40:38.031 --> 01:40:40.667
THAT CAUSES EXTREME VOLATILITY --

01:40:40.734 --> 01:40:42.336
SO IT'S ALWAYS A BALANCE BETWEEN

01:40:42.403 --> 01:40:43.137
WANTING THEM ALL LEVEL

01:40:43.203 --> 01:40:45.973
CONTRIBUTIONS BUT TRYING TO GET

01:40:46.039 --> 01:40:46.940
THAT THE HIGHEST RATED RETURN

01:40:47.007 --> 01:40:48.108
RIGHT --

01:40:48.175 --> 01:40:49.676
WE'VE JUST TIRED AND YOU CHAU

01:40:49.743 --> 01:40:50.444
HIS NAME SPENDING --

01:40:50.511 --> 01:40:52.613
I THINK YOU'LL BE HERE TALKING

01:40:52.679 --> 01:40:55.516
TO THE RETIREMENT COMMITTEE

01:40:55.582 --> 01:40:57.151
JOINT COMMITTEE NEXT WEEK AND

01:40:57.217 --> 01:40:59.586
WILL GIVE SOME INSIGHTS BUT HIS

01:40:59.653 --> 01:41:01.989
GOAL IN FOCUS AS HE'LL EXPLAIN

01:41:02.055 --> 01:41:04.124
IS TRYING TO THAT 7% BUT HE'LL

01:41:04.191 --> 01:41:05.259
TELL YOU STRAIGHT OUT.

01:41:05.325 --> 01:41:07.161
THAT 7% RETURN IS GOING TO BE A

01:41:07.227 --> 01:41:08.729
CHALLENGE --

01:41:08.796 --> 01:41:10.898
IF YOU LOOK AT THE EXPECTED

01:41:10.964 --> 01:41:12.466
RETURNS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL

01:41:12.533 --> 01:41:14.835
YEARS.

01:41:14.902 --> 01:41:16.537
WHAT I'M GETTING AT IT'S MEAN

01:41:16.603 --> 01:41:17.404
IT'S GOOD IT'S GONNA BE WHICH IF

01:41:17.471 --> 01:41:19.206
YOU OVERSHOOT AND WHAT HAPPENS

01:41:19.273 --> 01:41:19.873
IF YOU?

01:41:19.940 --> 01:41:20.841
IF FOURTH WE OVERSEEING THE

01:41:20.908 --> 01:41:25.946
SEVEN AND WE AND WE ONLY END UP

01:41:26.013 --> 01:41:29.082
AT FIVE THE WILL LOSSES OCCURRED

01:41:29.149 --> 01:41:31.018
YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR.

01:41:31.084 --> 01:41:33.420
YOUR RATES WOULD SLOWLY CREEP UP

01:41:33.487 --> 01:41:34.621
AND AT SOME POINT WE WOULD HAVE

01:41:34.688 --> 01:41:35.622
TO WOULD MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT

01:41:35.689 --> 01:41:36.824
DISCOUNT RATE BECAUSE IT.

01:41:36.890 --> 01:41:38.258
IT WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE AT

01:41:38.325 --> 01:41:39.860
THOSE RETURNS REALLY

01:41:39.927 --> 01:41:41.895
REALISTICALLY CAN OCCUR AND AND

01:41:41.962 --> 01:41:43.197
WE DON'T.

01:41:43.263 --> 01:41:44.631
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO

01:41:44.698 --> 01:41:48.702
CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE --

01:41:48.769 --> 01:41:49.670
HILL KIND LIKE A MISSED

01:41:49.736 --> 01:41:50.804
ALLOCATION OF FUNDS YOU'RE

01:41:50.871 --> 01:41:51.438
PUSHING OFF THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS

01:41:51.505 --> 01:41:53.340
TO THE FUTURE GENERATIONS AS

01:41:53.407 --> 01:41:56.210
OPPOSED TO ACTUALLY MAKING --

01:41:56.276 --> 01:41:58.212
THE COST PAYABLE TO BY THE

01:41:58.278 --> 01:42:00.447
TAXPAYERS RIGHT.

01:42:00.514 --> 01:42:01.315
THANKS I LOOK FORWARD TO

01:42:01.381 --> 01:42:02.382

YOUR YOUR FOUR YEAR PROCESS MY

01:42:04.651 --> 01:42:06.687

I KNOW.

01:42:10.257 --> 01:42:11.558
WHAT I'M A BUDGET RESILIENCE

01:42:11.625 --> 01:42:12.826
TODAY I BROUGHT IT UP IF FEW

01:42:12.893 --> 01:42:15.295
HEARINGS IN THE PAST ABOUT --

01:42:15.362 --> 01:42:17.130
ONE OF OUR ON GOING WHAT I

01:42:17.197 --> 01:42:18.832
CONSIDER ALSO A LIABILITY WHICH

01:42:18.899 --> 01:42:20.400
IS -- THE

01:42:20.467 --> 01:42:22.102
EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS THAT

01:42:22.169 --> 01:42:23.604
SEEM TO BE COMING UP YEAR AFTER

01:42:23.670 --> 01:42:24.371
YEAR AND IN FACT --

01:42:24.438 --> 01:42:25.105
PENSION FUNDS ARE DEEPLY

01:42:25.172 --> 01:42:27.374
INVESTED IN THE UTILITY SECTOR

01:42:27.441 --> 01:42:28.408
IN CALIFORNIA --

01:42:28.475 --> 01:42:29.943
IN P. JEANNIE AS WELL AS OUR

01:42:30.010 --> 01:42:33.213
OTHER INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES --

01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:35.415
LOOKING AT THAT.

01:42:35.482 --> 01:42:38.118
THAT ISSUE NOT SO MUCH AS SAY AN

01:42:38.185 --> 01:42:39.520
ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMMER AND

01:42:39.586 --> 01:42:41.088
ENERGY EXPENDITURE BUT BUT

01:42:41.154 --> 01:42:42.356
REALLY TRYING TO GET OUR HEADS

01:42:42.422 --> 01:42:44.525
AROUND WHAT THE ON GOING.

01:42:44.591 --> 01:42:46.293
COSTS COULD BE TO THE STATE ON A

01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:48.595
MULTI YEAR BASIS FROM THE SERVER

01:42:48.662 --> 01:42:51.098
WILD FIRE EMERGENCY SECTOR.

01:42:51.164 --> 01:42:53.700

BUT I REALLY I'M EXCITED THAT WE

01:43:00.173 --> 01:43:02.276
I THINK WE JUST RE AUTHORIZED

01:43:02.342 --> 01:43:04.278
HERE THROUGH THE VOTE TODAY INC

01:43:04.344 --> 01:43:07.180

01:43:07.247 --> 01:43:10.918
OF THE DISASTER SAID DISASTER.

THOUGHT TO TO THAT ISSUE SORT OF

01:43:21.228 --> 01:43:21.361
ODD.

01:43:21.428 --> 01:43:22.195
TO HOW.

01:43:22.262 --> 01:43:24.431
TO ACCURATELY --

01:43:24.498 --> 01:43:26.199
EVEN IF NOT PROJECT AT LEAST

01:43:26.266 --> 01:43:27.935
MODEL --

01:43:28.001 --> 01:43:29.369
WHAT THAT RISK COULD LOOK LIKE

01:43:29.436 --> 01:43:30.771
FOR US GOING FORWARD WHAT IT

01:43:30.837 --> 01:43:31.972
LOOKS LIKE TO HAVE A SORT OF

01:43:32.039 --> 01:43:33.407
STABILITY OR AT LEAST

01:43:33.473 --> 01:43:35.275
ANTICIPATING RISKS ON A MULTI

01:43:35.342 --> 01:43:37.644
YEAR BASIS ON THE DISASTER SIDE

01:43:37.711 --> 01:43:39.079
OF THINGS AND HOW TO SORT OF?

01:43:39.146 --> 01:43:41.348

01:43:44.051 --> 01:43:44.418
FLOW.

01:43:44.484 --> 01:43:46.086
TO THINK AND ELEVEN BILLION

01:43:46.153 --> 01:43:47.788
DOLLARS SOMETHING THAT THE

01:43:47.854 --> 01:43:49.590
ELEVEN POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR

01:43:49.656 --> 01:43:51.858
D. W. R. BOND WHEN WHEN WE HAD.

01:43:51.925 --> 01:43:52.960
TO LIKE TRICITY CRISIS AND I

01:43:53.026 --> 01:43:54.261
DON'T THINK THIS IS AN ENERGY

01:43:54.328 --> 01:43:56.263
CRISIS I ACTUALLY I THINK IT'S A

01:43:56.330 --> 01:43:57.531
RESTRUCTURING OPPORTUNITY

01:43:57.598 --> 01:43:58.865
ACTUALLY TO GET THINGS HEALTHY

01:43:58.932 --> 01:44:01.068
AND STABLE BUT JUST FURTHER

01:44:01.134 --> 01:44:03.203
THOUGHTS ON THAT SINCE OUR LAST

01:44:03.270 --> 01:44:03.470
HEARINGS.

01:44:03.537 --> 01:44:03.971
YES SIR THIS IS A VERY

01:44:04.037 --> 01:44:05.772
COMPLICATED ISSUE AND IT'S NOT

01:44:05.839 --> 01:44:07.407
SOMETHING SPECIFICALLY AT

01:44:07.474 --> 01:44:08.742
FINANCE WHERE WE YOU KNOW WE

01:44:08.809 --> 01:44:10.177
HAVEN'T MODELED.

01:44:10.243 --> 01:44:11.178
THE SERIOUS SPECIFICALLY RELATED

01:44:11.244 --> 01:44:12.045
TO CLIMATE BUT ACROSS THE

01:44:12.112 --> 01:44:14.648
ADMINISTRATION IS A PRIORITY SO

01:44:14.715 --> 01:44:15.282
COUPLETHINGS I WANT TO MENTION

01:44:15.349 --> 01:44:17.250
FIRST YOU KNOW AT FINANCE WE

01:44:17.317 --> 01:44:18.385

01:44:18.452 --> 01:44:19.553
HEALTHY ASSET TO YOU.

01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:21.288
NOT JUST THIS YEAR BUT OVER THE

01:44:21.355 --> 01:44:22.623
NEXT THREE YEARSBECAUSE WE KNOW

01:44:22.689 --> 01:44:24.057
THESE THINGS AT SOME POINT WILL

01:44:24.124 --> 01:44:25.158
HAPPEN AGAIN HOPEFULLY NOT WITH

01:44:25.225 --> 01:44:29.896
THIS LEVEL SEVERITY BUT IT'S NOT

01:44:29.963 --> 01:44:30.530
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN PUT AN END

01:44:30.597 --> 01:44:35.302
TO RIGHT NOW IS THROUGH THE VOTE.

01:44:35.369 --> 01:44:35.936
NINE IN ALMOST ALL THE WERE HERE

LEVEL APPOINTEES THAT WE HAVE ON

SPECIFIC PINT YOU MENTION

01:45:18.979 --> 01:45:20.414
QUANTIFYING THOSE RISKS SO I

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:21.815
DON'T KNOW THAT THERE IS A PLAN

01:45:21.882 --> 01:45:23.116
IN PLACE TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW

01:45:23.183 --> 01:45:25.552
pABOUT THE PEOPLE AND PERSONNEL

01:45:25.619 --> 01:45:26.620
INVOLVED.

01:45:26.687 --> 01:45:28.655
THERE'S A LOT OF EXPERTISE OF

01:45:28.722 --> 01:45:29.256
PEOPLE WHO ARE THINKING ABOUT

01:45:29.322 --> 01:45:30.991
THOSE QUESTIONS.

01:45:31.058 --> 01:45:37.064
YES THANK YOU THANK YOU THIRD.

01:45:37.130 --> 01:45:37.564
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR.

01:45:37.631 --> 01:45:38.198
FIRST I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK

YOU TO ALL OF YOU AND TO THE

01:45:38.865 --> 01:45:39.966
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOR ALL THE

01:45:40.033 --> 01:45:41.401
HARD WORK THAT YOU ARE DOING AND

01:45:41.468 --> 01:45:43.103
CONTINUE TO DO. TO MAKE SURE

01:45:43.170 --> 01:45:44.871
PENSION FUNDS ARE WHERE THEY

01:45:44.938 --> 01:45:46.173
NEED TO BE AND SO THE FOLKS THAT

01:45:46.239 --> 01:45:47.774
WE'VE MADE PROMISES TO WE CAN

01:45:47.841 --> 01:45:48.942
ACTUALLY DELIVER ON THOSE

01:45:49.009 --> 01:45:50.343
PROMISES.

01:45:50.410 --> 01:45:51.912
I HAD A QUESTION FOR YOU MISTER

01:45:51.978 --> 01:45:53.747
LAMB MORALE THEY SAY THAT EVEN

01:45:53.814 --> 01:45:56.116
REMOTELY CLOSE HE DID THE THING

01:45:56.183 --> 01:45:57.484
OKAY THANK YOU.

01:45:57.551 --> 01:45:59.186
SO A CAL STIR STIRS WILL BE

01:45:59.252 --> 01:46:01.788
FULLY FUNDED AND TWENTY FORTY

01:46:01.855 --> 01:46:03.190
SIX CORRECT THAT IS THE GOAL OF

01:46:03.256 --> 01:46:04.624
THAT'S THE GOAL AND WE HAVE A

01:46:04.691 --> 01:46:05.025
PLAN.

01:46:05.092 --> 01:46:06.893
SO I APPRECIATE YOU SAYING THAT

01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:08.295
BECAUSE WE HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT

01:46:08.361 --> 01:46:10.363
UNFUNDED LIABILITIES AND I THINK

01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:12.232
THAT PEOPLE MISS THE POINT AND

01:46:12.299 --> 01:46:12.899
THE FACT THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE A

01:46:12.966 --> 01:46:15.702
PLAN. TO GET US TO WHERE WE NEED

01:46:15.769 --> 01:46:18.672
TO BE SO I HOPE THAT PLAN AND

01:46:18.739 --> 01:46:20.006
THAT WE'RE GOING WE'RE WORKING

01:46:20.073 --> 01:46:22.209
HARD TO GET TO FULLY FUNDED AND

01:46:22.275 --> 01:46:23.610
NOT JUST TALK ABOUT UNFUNDED

01:46:23.677 --> 01:46:24.544
LIABILITIES BECAUSE I THINK

01:46:24.611 --> 01:46:26.012
UNFUNDED LIABILITIES.

01:46:26.079 --> 01:46:27.514
ARE JUST A FACT WHEN IT COMES TO

01:46:27.581 --> 01:46:29.516
RETIREMENT SYSTEMS AND PENSION

01:46:29.583 --> 01:46:30.851
PLANS.

01:46:30.917 --> 01:46:32.552
AND I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT --

01:46:32.619 --> 01:46:34.988
CALPERS THEIR FIFTY SEVEN

01:46:35.055 --> 01:46:36.790
BILLION AND UNFUNDED LIABILITIES

01:46:36.857 --> 01:46:37.858
THAT'S CORRECT.

01:46:37.924 --> 01:46:39.893
AND ARE THEY ALSO ON TRACK TO BE

01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:44.164
FULLY FUNDED AND TWENTY FORTY

01:46:44.231 --> 01:46:45.732
SIX YEAH ACTUALLY PROBABLY A

01:46:45.799 --> 01:46:47.734
LITTLE BIT FOR THE RIVER.

01:46:47.801 --> 01:46:49.836
AMORTIZATION POLICY THAT THAT

01:46:49.903 --> 01:46:50.670
SORT OF ALLOCATES ON A YEAR BY

01:46:50.737 --> 01:46:52.672
YEAR BASIS SO WE HAVE SOME BASIS

01:46:52.739 --> 01:46:53.874
THAT HAVE BEEN ON AND ARE BEING

01:46:53.940 --> 01:46:56.076
PAID OFF. TEN TWELVE YEARS HAVE

01:46:56.143 --> 01:46:57.811
LEFT THAT'S GREAT AND THEN THE

01:46:57.878 --> 01:46:58.979
MORE RECENT ONES ARE THE LIKE A

01:46:59.045 --> 01:47:00.881
THIRTY YEAR BASE WHICH HAS

01:47:00.947 --> 01:47:01.681
THIRTY YEARS REMAINING.

01:47:01.748 --> 01:47:04.117
ARM WE'VE JUST CHANGE OUR POLICY

01:47:04.184 --> 01:47:04.851
IN FACT WE'RE GOING TO TWENTY

01:47:04.918 --> 01:47:05.652
YEARS.

01:47:05.719 --> 01:47:08.622
MAXIMUM PERIOD STARTING WITH THE

01:47:08.688 --> 01:47:10.490
NEXT ALLEY WHICH THE COMES UP.

01:47:10.557 --> 01:47:12.425
SO WE ARE MOST THOSE BENEFITS

01:47:12.492 --> 01:47:13.527
AND OBLIGATIONS WE PAID OFF

01:47:13.593 --> 01:47:15.896
WITHIN THIRTY YEARS FANTASTIC

01:47:15.962 --> 01:47:17.097
DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING WHAT IS

01:47:17.164 --> 01:47:18.398
THE ONLY ONE COMMENT I WOULD

01:47:18.465 --> 01:47:19.900
LIKE TO MAKE IS BECAUSE SOMETIME

01:47:19.966 --> 01:47:21.134
WE HAVE EVEN FOR US WE HAVE A

01:47:21.201 --> 01:47:22.169
LOT OF MEMBERS.

01:47:22.235 --> 01:47:24.805
THAT WILL CALL US AND BE WORRIED

01:47:24.871 --> 01:47:27.440
BECAUSE THEY SEE WERE 63% FUNDED

01:47:27.507 --> 01:47:28.842
IN THE MAIN MESSAGE WE HAVE FOR

01:47:28.909 --> 01:47:30.777
EVERYONE WE REPEAT IT TWO OR

01:47:30.844 --> 01:47:32.212
BOARD ALL THE TIME.

01:47:32.279 --> 01:47:33.213
IT'S DONE THIS IS SILLY WHERE

01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:34.414
YOU ARE THAT SHOULD BE ALARMING

01:47:34.481 --> 01:47:36.216
IS OR YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING TO

01:47:36.283 --> 01:47:38.051
WHERE YOU'RE HEADING THAT'S

01:47:38.118 --> 01:47:39.186
RIGHT IF YOU LOOKED IS BACK.

01:47:39.252 --> 01:47:40.787
LAKE TEN YEARS AGO FOR US WE

01:47:40.854 --> 01:47:42.522
WERE ABOUT 80% FUNDED AT CAL

01:47:42.589 --> 01:47:43.690
STIRS.

01:47:43.757 --> 01:47:45.892
BUT WE WERE ON THE WAY DOWN

01:47:45.959 --> 01:47:49.896
BECAUSE WE CHIU IN PLACE TODAY

01:47:49.963 --> 01:47:51.665
ALL THE WITH 63% FUNDED WERE

01:47:51.731 --> 01:47:52.766
HEADING UP AND THAT'S THE KEY

01:47:52.833 --> 01:47:54.201
pYOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE FOCUSING ON

01:47:54.267 --> 01:47:55.936
WHAT'S THE DESTINATION.

01:47:56.002 --> 01:47:57.604
AND RIGHT NOW A DESTINATION IS

01:47:57.671 --> 01:47:58.805
ALL POURED WHICH IS.

01:47:58.872 --> 01:48:00.507
IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE VERY GLAD

01:48:00.574 --> 01:48:02.809
AND BE FOCUSING ON YES I AGREE A

01:48:02.876 --> 01:48:05.145
100% APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S WORK

01:48:05.212 --> 01:48:06.546
AND IF WE CAN JUST CONTINUE TO

01:48:06.613 --> 01:48:08.014
GET THAT MESSAGE OUT THERE

01:48:08.081 --> 01:48:08.915
BECAUSE I THINK SO MANY TIMES

01:48:08.982 --> 01:48:10.250
IT'S JUST TWO MEN GLOOM AND

01:48:10.317 --> 01:48:11.852
EVERYTHING IS HORRIBLE.

01:48:11.918 --> 01:48:13.186
AND THEY DON'T REALIZE THAT WE

01:48:13.253 --> 01:48:16.556
ARE ON AN UPWARD TRACK SO THANK

01:48:16.623 --> 01:48:18.792
YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

01:48:18.859 --> 01:48:23.897
THE WHITE HOUSE. ONE QUESTION --

01:48:23.964 --> 01:48:26.600
MR THIS ONE UP ON CALPERS AND

01:48:26.666 --> 01:48:28.535
CAL STIRS OUR SHAREHOLDERS IN

01:48:28.602 --> 01:48:30.570
THE P. JEANNIE REORGANIZATION

01:48:30.637 --> 01:48:31.538
ONE THE CARDINAL RULES IN

01:48:31.605 --> 01:48:32.839
BANKRUPTCY IF YOU DON'T PAY YOUR

01:48:32.906 --> 01:48:34.541
CLAIM IT'S A 100%.

01:48:34.608 --> 01:48:35.141
THOUGH SHAREHOLDERS GET WIPED

01:48:35.208 --> 01:48:36.309
OUT.

01:48:36.376 --> 01:48:38.345
CAN YOU QUANTIFY THAT SEVEN

01:48:38.411 --> 01:48:40.747
BILLION DOLLAR RISK WHAT WE MAY

01:48:40.814 --> 01:48:42.983
TWO BECAUSE TYPICALLY IN A

01:48:43.049 --> 01:48:45.418
REORGANIZATION THE DEBTOR OFFERS

01:48:45.485 --> 01:48:46.953
THOSE WIPED OUT SHAREHOLDERS AN

01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:48.021
OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE NEW

01:48:48.088 --> 01:48:50.123
SHARES AT SOME.

01:48:50.190 --> 01:48:52.659
DISCOUNTED RATE.

01:48:52.726 --> 01:48:55.595
GOING LOOKING FORWARD.

01:48:55.662 --> 01:48:55.929
SO YES SO --

01:48:55.996 --> 01:48:57.230
I DON'T HAVE A CLEAR ANSWER TO

01:48:57.297 --> 01:48:59.933
THAT QUESTION BECAUSE AS YOU

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:01.434
KNOW IN EVERY BANKRUPTCY THE OUT.

01:49:01.501 --> 01:49:02.335
OFTEN SHAREHOLDERS TO GET WIPED

01:49:02.402 --> 01:49:03.803
OUT -- BUT

01:49:03.870 --> 01:49:05.071
WHEN YOU LOOK BACK TO THE MOST

01:49:05.138 --> 01:49:06.539
RECENT P. JEANNIE BANKRUPTCY AND

01:49:06.606 --> 01:49:08.808
THE OUTCOMES WERE MUCH MILDER

01:49:08.875 --> 01:49:10.110
FOR A LOT OF THE STAKEHOLDERS

01:49:10.176 --> 01:49:10.543
THERE.

01:49:10.610 --> 01:49:11.611
SO THE ONLY ANSWER I HAVE IS

01:49:11.678 --> 01:49:13.113
NUMBER ONE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S

01:49:13.179 --> 01:49:15.615
GONNA HAPPEN BUT NUMBER --

ADMINISTRATION TO DEAL WITH THE

01:49:20.186 --> 01:49:22.255
SITUATION WILL MAKE SURE THAT

01:49:22.322 --> 01:49:23.857
WHEN IT COMES NOT JUST TO THE

01:49:23.924 --> 01:49:25.992
STATE ITSELF BUT TO CALPERS AND

BUT TO MISTER MOORE LOCKS A

01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:40.600
QUESTION OR COMMENT EARLIER SO --

01:50:40.667 --> 01:50:41.301
IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE AS I

01:50:41.368 --> 01:50:42.569
MENTIONED EARLIER WE HAVE A

01:50:42.635 --> 01:50:45.271
FUNDING PLAN IN PLACE BUT

01:50:45.338 --> 01:50:46.072

01:50:55.248 --> 01:50:57.317
BEYOND THAT POINT OR BOARD WILL

01:50:57.384 --> 01:50:59.986

THE CONTRIBUTION RTE FOR THE

01:51:01.721 --> 01:51:03.990
SCHOOL DISTRICTS WE HAVE LIMITS

01:51:04.057 --> 01:51:04.791
FOR THE I I DID MENTION IT

01:51:04.858 --> 01:51:06.292
EARLIER BUT OUR BOARD WILL BE

01:51:06.359 --> 01:51:08.428
ABLE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS.

01:51:08.495 --> 01:51:10.530
UPWARD OR DOWNWARD BY NO MORE

01:51:10.597 --> 01:51:12.966
THAN 1% IN ANY GIVEN YEAR.

01:51:13.033 --> 01:51:14.334
AND IN THE MOST RECENT

01:51:14.401 --> 01:51:16.202
INFORMATION WE PROVIDED OR BOARD

01:51:21.408 --> 01:51:22.509
THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S

18%.

01:51:26.713 --> 01:51:29.382
SO IT CREATES AN INTERESTING

01:51:29.449 --> 01:51:33.186
SITUATION FUNDING FROM THE STATE

01:51:33.253 --> 01:51:34.154

01:51:36.156 --> 01:51:38.658
POINT 1% NEXT YEAR. NINETEEN

01:51:38.725 --> 01:51:40.593
POINT 1% THE FOLLOWING YEAR AND

01:51:40.660 --> 01:51:42.195
IT POTENTIALLY OR BOARD WOULDN'T

01:51:42.262 --> 01:51:43.596
TURN AROUND A YEAR LATER AND

01:51:43.663 --> 01:51:46.366
WOULD USE IT AGAIN --

01:51:46.433 --> 01:51:48.501
I'M NOT A BUDGET PERSON I'VE OF

01:51:48.568 --> 01:51:50.837
I USED TO WORK AT CALPERS BEFORE

01:51:50.904 --> 01:51:52.338
AND I REMEMBER SOME OF THE

01:51:52.405 --> 01:51:53.440
COMMENTS THAT EMPLOYERS USE TO

01:51:53.506 --> 01:51:54.274
TELL US WHICH IS I WOULD RATHER

01:51:54.340 --> 01:51:56.643
HAVE A STABLE CONTRIBUTION RATE.

01:51:56.709 --> 01:51:58.244
THAN HAVE WANTED INCREASES AND

01:51:58.311 --> 01:52:00.280
SUDDENLY DECREASES SO I THINK

01:52:00.346 --> 01:52:01.915
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

01:52:01.981 --> 01:52:03.416
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL --

01:52:03.483 --> 01:52:04.951
IT I SORT OF A TRADE OFF AND

01:52:05.018 --> 01:52:06.953
GIVING SHORT TERM RELIEF TO

01:52:07.020 --> 01:52:09.222
EMPLOYERS AND LONG TERM RELIEF

01:52:09.289 --> 01:52:10.523
AS WELL.

01:52:10.590 --> 01:52:12.325
I PLEASE MYSELF IF I MADE A

01:52:12.392 --> 01:52:13.493
BUDGET PERSON AND I'M LOOKING AT

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:16.496
WHAT IT MIGHT DO IT'S LOOKING IN

01:52:16.563 --> 01:52:17.664
ALL ITS WORST IT SEEMS THAT IT

01:52:17.730 --> 01:52:18.731
WILL PROVIDE.

01:52:18.798 --> 01:52:20.366
MORE OF A STABLE.

01:52:20.433 --> 01:52:21.768
IF YOU WANT PATH FOR THE

01:52:21.835 --> 01:52:23.369
CONTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT TO CAL

01:52:23.436 --> 01:52:24.737
STIRS WERE POTENTIALLY IT WILL

01:52:24.804 --> 01:52:26.940
INCREASE 18% AND STAY AROUND

01:52:27.006 --> 01:52:28.308
THAT LEVEL SO.

01:52:28.374 --> 01:52:29.609
THAT'S PROBABLY ANNOYS YOU

01:52:29.676 --> 01:52:31.511
CONSIDER THIS PROPOSAL THIS THIS

01:52:31.578 --> 01:52:33.146
COULD BE VIEWED AS ONE OF THE

01:52:33.213 --> 01:52:33.813
ADVANTAGES.

01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:35.381
&lt;c.green&gt;UT THEY SHOULD PROVIDE MORE&lt;/c&gt;

01:52:35.448 --> 01:52:39.185
BUDGET STABILITY --

01:52:39.252 --> 01:52:44.124
FOR EMPLOYERS.

01:52:44.190 --> 01:52:44.324
I'M.

01:52:44.390 --> 01:52:46.092
HAVING BEEN ON A PRIVATE SECTOR

01:52:46.159 --> 01:52:47.327
PENSION PLAN OF ONE OF HE

01:52:47.393 --> 01:52:48.928
THINGS THAT ALWAYS IMPACTED THE

01:52:48.995 --> 01:52:50.263
PLAN WITH THE NUMBER OF

01:52:50.330 --> 01:52:51.931
PARTICIPANTS.

01:52:51.998 --> 01:52:53.766
AND THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYERS.

01:52:53.833 --> 01:52:57.237
SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS IN THE

01:52:57.303 --> 01:52:58.605
PUBLIC SECTOR.

01:52:58.671 --> 01:53:01.307
UP VERSION OF THE PLAN.

01:53:01.374 --> 01:53:04.344
WHAT WHAT IS THE WHAT HAS BEEN

01:53:04.410 --> 01:53:06.045
HAS THERE BEEN AN IMPACT IN

01:53:06.112 --> 01:53:08.548
TERMS OF NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS

01:53:08.615 --> 01:53:10.350
A NUMBER OF EMPLOYERS?

01:53:10.416 --> 01:53:13.586
AND IN PARTICULAR WITH CHARTER

01:53:13.653 --> 01:53:14.954
SCHOOLS --

01:53:15.021 --> 01:53:17.657
COULD YOU DESCRIBE THAT IS THAT

01:53:17.724 --> 01:53:19.559
AN ISSUE HASN'T BEEN.

01:53:19.626 --> 01:53:21.161
OR COULD YOU SEE I I CAN

01:53:21.227 --> 01:53:22.829
ELABORATE ON THIS SO AGAIN I

01:53:22.896 --> 01:53:23.863
THINK THE ANSWER MAY BE

01:53:23.930 --> 01:53:26.099
DIFFERENT BETWEEN CAL STIRS AND

01:53:26.166 --> 01:53:27.867
CALPERS --

01:53:27.934 --> 01:53:28.434
SO FOR US EVERY YEAR FOR THE

01:53:28.501 --> 01:53:33.473
LAST. FOR PRESENTING TOUR ABOARD

01:53:33.540 --> 01:53:35.041
A REPORT THAT WE CALL THE REVIEW

01:53:35.108 --> 01:53:36.576
OF CAL STORMS FUNDING LEVELS AND

01:53:36.643 --> 01:53:37.911
RISK WE WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO

01:53:37.977 --> 01:53:40.480
FOCUS AND MAKE OUR BOARD AWARE

01:53:40.547 --> 01:53:41.581
OF WHERE WHAT ARE SORT OF THE

01:53:41.648 --> 01:53:42.715
MAIN RISKS.

01:53:42.782 --> 01:53:43.983
THAT WE SHOULD BE AWARE IS A

01:53:44.050 --> 01:53:46.085
SYSTEM THAT COULD PREVENT US

01:53:46.152 --> 01:53:47.754
FROM REACHING FULL FUNDING AND

01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:49.055
YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT BECAUSE

01:53:49.122 --> 01:53:50.523
FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS WE HAVE

01:53:50.590 --> 01:53:51.991
BEEN FOCUSING ON THREE MAIN

01:53:52.058 --> 01:53:53.026
RISKS.

01:53:53.092 --> 01:53:54.494
FIRST ONE BEING INVESTMENT RISK

01:53:54.561 --> 01:53:56.496
I THINK EVERYONE IS AWARE OF THE

01:53:56.563 --> 01:53:58.364
FLUCTUATION INVESTMENT MARKETS.

01:53:58.431 --> 01:54:00.400
THE SECOND ONE BEING A HOW LONG

01:54:00.466 --> 01:54:02.268
OUR MEMBERS LIVE AND IN CASE YOU

01:54:02.335 --> 01:54:04.604
HAVEN'T SEEN RECENT NEWS REPORTS

01:54:04.671 --> 01:54:05.905
WE'VE ALWAYS KNOWN THIS AT CAL

01:54:05.972 --> 01:54:07.907
STIRS BUT THE THE EXPRESSION

01:54:07.974 --> 01:54:09.342
THAT TEACHERS LIVE FOREVER.

01:54:09.409 --> 01:54:12.078
HAS MORE AND MORE TRUTH TO IT.

01:54:12.145 --> 01:54:14.147
TAKE EACH MONTH OR BOARD MEMBER

01:54:14.214 --> 01:54:16.149
OR ARE CHAIR OF THE IN A DILLON

01:54:16.216 --> 01:54:17.317
SENDS BIRTHDAY CARDS TO OUR

01:54:17.383 --> 01:54:19.285
BOARD MEMBERS WHO TURNED ONE

01:54:19.352 --> 01:54:20.987
HUNDRED YEARS OLD TO OUR MEMBERS.

01:54:21.054 --> 01:54:24.023
AND SHE'S BEEN SIGNING CLOSE TO

01:54:24.090 --> 01:54:24.624
THIRTY OF THESE LETTERS EACH

01:54:24.691 --> 01:54:25.658
MONTH.

01:54:25.725 --> 01:54:28.394
JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA WE HAVE

01:54:28.461 --> 01:54:30.396
APPROACHING FOUR HUNDRED MEMBERS

01:54:30.463 --> 01:54:34.167
WHO ARE CURRENTLY A HUNDRED

01:54:34.234 --> 01:54:36.502
YEARS OLD A MORE.

01:54:36.569 --> 01:54:37.403
AND THE THIRD RISK THAT WE PAY A

01:54:37.470 --> 01:54:38.972
LOT OF ATTENTION --

01:54:39.038 --> 01:54:40.373
GOING BACK TO THE QUESTION IS

01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:42.008
THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS IN

01:54:42.075 --> 01:54:42.976
OUR SYSTEM.

01:54:43.042 --> 01:54:44.577
IT AGAIN IT ALL GOES BACK TO

01:54:44.644 --> 01:54:46.512
REASON WE BRING THAT UP FOUR AND

01:54:46.579 --> 01:54:48.314
THEN AGAIN IT'S JUST SPECIFIC TO

01:54:48.381 --> 01:54:50.083
OUR SITUATION.

01:54:50.149 --> 01:54:51.784
BECAUSE OUR BOARD HAS LIMITED

01:54:51.851 --> 01:54:53.286
AUTHORITY TO ADJUST CONTRIBUTION

01:54:53.353 --> 01:54:54.387
RATE.

01:54:54.454 --> 01:54:58.224
AND ONE OF THE BIG FACTOR IS OF

01:54:58.291 --> 01:54:59.826
CONTRIBUTING TEACHERS THE

01:54:59.892 --> 01:55:01.594
PAYROLL OF THE SYSTEM IF YOU

01:55:01.661 --> 01:55:03.563
WANT TO TO THE EXTENT WE WERE TO

01:55:03.630 --> 01:55:05.265
START TO SEE A DECLINE IN THE

01:55:05.331 --> 01:55:07.033
NUMBER OF TEACHERS IN CALIFORNIA

01:55:07.100 --> 01:55:08.201
FOR VARIOUS REASONS.

01:55:08.268 --> 01:55:09.569
IT COULD BE BECAUSE WE HAVE LESS

01:55:09.636 --> 01:55:11.704
CHILDREN IT COULD BE BECAUSE OF

01:55:11.771 --> 01:55:13.306
BUDGET PRESSURE WHAT WE HAVE TO

01:55:13.373 --> 01:55:14.707
REDUCE CLASS SIZES.

01:55:14.774 --> 01:55:17.243
OR FOR US WE TRY TO KEEP AN EYE

01:55:17.310 --> 01:55:18.611
ON COMMITTEE COLLEGES WHICH ARE

01:55:18.678 --> 01:55:20.179
PART OF CAL STIRS BECAUSE YOU

01:55:20.246 --> 01:55:21.147
NEVER KNOW.

01:55:21.214 --> 01:55:22.148
THE WE WOULD DELIVER IT

01:55:22.215 --> 01:55:24.083
EDUCATION MAY CHANGE DOWN THE

01:55:24.150 --> 01:55:26.586
ROAD OF WITH ONLINE LEARNING

01:55:26.653 --> 01:55:28.321
THERE MAYBE A NEED FOR LESS

01:55:28.388 --> 01:55:28.988
TEACHERS IN THE FUTURE SO THOSE

01:55:29.055 --> 01:55:30.590
ARE KIND OF WE'VE BEEN PAYING

01:55:30.657 --> 01:55:31.924
ATTENTION TO THESE RISK AND FOR

01:55:31.991 --> 01:55:32.792
US.

01:55:32.859 --> 01:55:34.460
BECAUSE WE HAVE RATE SETTING WE

01:55:34.527 --> 01:55:35.728
HAVE LIMIATION ON HOW WE CAN

01:55:35.795 --> 01:55:39.165
SET THE RATES IT BECOMES A VERY

01:55:39.232 --> 01:55:43.236
IMPORTANT PART OF THE EQUATION.

01:55:43.303 --> 01:55:46.072
HAS IT BEEN SO.

01:55:46.139 --> 01:55:47.607
YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION. TO FOR

01:55:47.674 --> 01:55:49.342
US IN THE LAST FIVE TO TEN YEARS

01:55:49.409 --> 01:55:50.510
THE NUMBERS HAVE GROWN ACT IF

01:55:50.576 --> 01:55:52.612
YOU GO BACK A DECADE --

01:55:52.679 --> 01:55:53.946
IT IT IT KIND OF DIPLO ABOUT A

01:55:54.013 --> 01:55:55.481
DECADE AGO BUT SINCE FOR THE

01:55:55.548 --> 01:55:56.849
LAST FIVE YEARS WE HAVE SEEN A

01:55:56.916 --> 01:55:59.619
CONSTANT INCREASE THE NUMBER OF

01:55:59.686 --> 01:56:01.354
ACTIVE TEACHERS IN CALIFORNIA

01:56:01.421 --> 01:56:03.523
AND SO OUR MEMBERSHIP HAS BEEN

01:56:03.589 --> 01:56:04.424
GROWING --

01:56:04.490 --> 01:56:05.858
BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT PROJECTIONS

01:56:05.925 --> 01:56:06.893
FOR EXAMPLE THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:56:06.959 --> 01:56:09.262
FINANCE ISSUES ABOUT PROJECTION

01:56:09.329 --> 01:56:11.097
OF FOR STUDENTS A K. THROUGH

01:56:11.164 --> 01:56:12.932
TWELVE STUDENTS FOR EXAMPLE.

01:56:12.999 --> 01:56:14.267
IT'S FAIRLY STABLE OR EVEN

01:56:14.334 --> 01:56:16.169
EXPECTED TO SLIGHTLY DECLINE SO

01:56:16.235 --> 01:56:17.570
WE WOULDN'T EXPECT THAT MUCH OF

01:56:17.637 --> 01:56:18.438
A GROWTH.

01:56:18.504 --> 01:56:20.873
GOING FORWARD BUT HE HAS BEEN

01:56:20.940 --> 01:56:22.608
GROWING FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS.

01:56:22.675 --> 01:56:24.077
AND IT'S BEEN ONE OF THE DRIVER

01:56:24.143 --> 01:56:26.312
OF WHY WE NOW EXPECT.

01:56:26.379 --> 01:56:30.416
A SLIGHTLY LOWER CONTRIBUTIONS

01:56:30.483 --> 01:56:31.651
TO WIN THE CAL STIRS FUNDING

01:56:31.718 --> 01:56:33.386
PLAN WAS PASSED IS BECAUSE WE

01:56:33.453 --> 01:56:36.222
HAVE MUCH MORE TEACHERS TODAY IN

01:56:36.289 --> 01:56:38.257
THE SYSTEMS THAN WE DID BACK IN

01:56:38.324 --> 01:56:43.229
TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN IRAQ.

01:56:43.296 --> 01:56:45.198
I THOUGHT THE THE FOLKS WHO KOW

01:56:45.264 --> 01:56:46.666
ABOUT THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN

01:56:46.733 --> 01:56:48.434
TALKING FOR SOME TIME ABOUT

01:56:48.501 --> 01:56:50.470
DECLINING ENROLLMENT IN CASE

01:56:50.536 --> 01:56:51.904
THROUGH FOURTEEN IN THE STATE.

01:56:51.971 --> 01:56:53.339
CERTAINLY IN THE OUT YEARS AND

01:56:53.406 --> 01:56:54.207
GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE'RE

01:56:54.273 --> 01:56:56.809
TALKING ABOUT.

01:56:56.876 --> 01:56:57.844
TWENTY FORTY SIX IF THAT'S TRUE

01:56:57.910 --> 01:57:00.313
DO YOU PLAN FOR IN YOUR

01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:01.948
PROJECTIONS FOR ANY SIGNIFICANT

01:57:02.014 --> 01:57:03.149
DECLINE.

01:57:03.216 --> 01:57:05.818
IN STUDENT ENROLLMENT IN CASE TO

01:57:05.885 --> 01:57:06.252
FOURTEEN AND AND THE

01:57:06.319 --> 01:57:07.019
COMMENSURATE.

01:57:07.086 --> 01:57:09.889
POTENTIAL FOR A REDUCTION IN

01:57:09.956 --> 01:57:12.225
YOUR PARTICIPATING --

01:57:12.291 --> 01:57:14.527
EMPLOYEES.

01:57:14.594 --> 01:57:16.062
BENEFICIARIES WITH A RECALL.

01:57:16.129 --> 01:57:17.463
RIGHT NOW BASED ON WHAT WE HAVE

01:57:17.530 --> 01:57:19.198
WHICH WE WE RELY A LOT ON SOME

01:57:19.265 --> 01:57:20.400
OF THE INFORMATION DEPARTMENT

01:57:20.466 --> 01:57:22.201
FINDS HAS ON THEIR WEBSITE THAT

01:57:22.268 --> 01:57:23.136
IS KIND OF THE PROJECTION OF K.

01:57:23.202 --> 01:57:24.470
THROUGH TWELVE STUDENTS.

01:57:24.537 --> 01:57:27.707
WERE IN ALL OF OUR WORK WE

01:57:27.774 --> 01:57:30.243
ASSUME THAT WE'RE GOING TO DE DE.

01:57:30.309 --> 01:57:30.843
FROM THE STUDENT POPULATION A

01:57:30.910 --> 01:57:31.878
NUMBER OF TEACHERS WILL REMAIN

01:57:31.944 --> 01:57:33.246
CONSTANT OVER TIME IS SORT OF

01:57:33.312 --> 01:57:34.680
THE WAY WE DO IT BUT TO THE

01:57:34.747 --> 01:57:36.382
EXTENT WE ALSO PROVIDE THE

01:57:36.449 --> 01:57:38.017
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO OUR

01:57:38.084 --> 01:57:38.718
BOARD.

01:57:38.785 --> 01:57:41.587
AND IN SITUATIONS WHERE WE IF WE

01:57:41.654 --> 01:57:43.523
WHERE TO GET TO SEE A DECLINE IN

01:57:43.589 --> 01:57:44.590
THE NUMBER OF TEACHERS THAT

01:57:44.657 --> 01:57:45.792
WOULD PUT PRESSURE ON

01:57:45.858 --> 01:57:47.527
CONTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS.

01:57:47.593 --> 01:57:49.929
PUSHING EVERYTHING UPWARD AT THE

01:57:49.996 --> 01:57:54.333
SONORA ON OUR SIDE.

THANK YOU FOR THE ROTH IN THE

01:59:06.606 --> 01:59:08.307
MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF YOUR

THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS

01:59:14.146 --> 01:59:15.548
ASSOCIATION I'D LIKE TO ECHO

01:59:15.615 --> 01:59:17.116
MANY OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE

01:59:17.183 --> 01:59:17.416
MADE -- BY

01:59:17.483 --> 01:59:18.885
MY COLLEAGUE --

01:59:18.951 --> 01:59:20.786
IN APPRECIATE THAT LEADERSHIP

01:59:20.853 --> 01:59:22.421
THAT THE GOVERNOR AND AND HIS

01:59:22.488 --> 01:59:24.123
STAFF WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:59:24.190 --> 01:59:25.424
ARE TAKING ON THIS ISSUE IT IS A

01:59:25.491 --> 01:59:26.292
TRUE THIS WILL HAVE A

01:59:26.359 --> 01:59:27.894
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT.

01:59:27.960 --> 01:59:28.995
ON HELPING SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO

01:59:29.061 --> 01:59:30.596
HAVE FLEXIBILITY IN THEIR

01:59:30.663 --> 01:59:33.533
BUDGETS FAX DO MATTER IN DURING

01:59:33.599 --> 01:59:34.934
THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT RECESSION

01:59:35.001 --> 01:59:37.036
OUR SCHOOLS LOST SIXTY FIVE

01:59:37.103 --> 01:59:38.871
BILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING FROM

01:59:38.938 --> 01:59:40.540
PROP NINETY EIGHT THAT WE NEVER

01:59:40.606 --> 01:59:42.008
RECEIVED OR NEVER GOING TO

01:59:42.074 --> 01:59:43.042
RECEIVE.

01:59:43.109 --> 01:59:44.677
THAT IS THE ONE OF THE REASONS

01:59:44.744 --> 01:59:46.512
WHY THE SYSTEMIC A LACK OF

01:59:46.579 --> 01:59:47.947
FISCAL SUPPORT DURING THAT

01:59:48.014 --> 01:59:50.049
RECESSION HAS REALLY --

01:59:50.116 --> 01:59:52.184
BECOME MORE ABOUT BOILING OVER

01:59:52.251 --> 01:59:53.185
PORT --

01:59:53.252 --> 01:59:54.554
POINT IN A LOT OF SCHOOL

01:59:54.620 --> 01:59:55.321
DISTRICTS THAT WE'RE HEARING

01:59:55.388 --> 01:59:56.489
ABOUT --

01:59:56.556 --> 01:59:58.024
IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF PENSIONS

01:59:58.090 --> 01:59:59.525
IT'S BECAUSE OF THE SYSTEMIC

01:59:59.592 --> 02:00:00.426
UNDER.

02:00:00.493 --> 02:00:02.528
OF EDUCATION FOR THE NEEDS THAT

02:00:02.595 --> 02:00:04.830
WE HAVE BECAUSE WE DO HAVE

02:00:04.897 --> 02:00:06.666
INCREASES IN CAL STIRS RATES BUT

02:00:06.732 --> 02:00:08.367
AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT TALK IN

02:00:08.434 --> 02:00:09.502
EDUCATION TERMS.

02:00:09.569 --> 02:00:11.671
SPECIAL EDUCATION HAS BEEN A

02:00:11.737 --> 02:00:15.908
SICK LACK OF FUNDING YESTERDAY I

02:00:15.975 --> 02:00:16.842
WAS WITH THE EDUCATORS FROM

02:00:16.909 --> 02:00:19.045
PARADISE IN SANTA ROSA.

02:00:19.111 --> 02:00:20.513
AND THE LACK OF ADEQUATE FUNDING

02:00:20.580 --> 02:00:22.148
IN TRANSPORTATION HAS MEANT THAT

02:00:22.214 --> 02:00:23.449
THOSE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:00:23.516 --> 02:00:26.285
IMPACTED BY THE RECENT WILDFIRES

02:00:26.352 --> 02:00:27.386
HAVE HAD TO USE MORE OF THEIR

02:00:27.453 --> 02:00:29.789
RESOURCES TO ACTUALLY HELP COVER

02:00:29.855 --> 02:00:31.691
TRANSPORTATION WHICH IS

02:00:31.757 --> 02:00:33.459
ENCROACHING INTO THEIR BUDGET.

02:00:33.526 --> 02:00:35.094
SO I DO WANT TO CLARIFY IN NOTE

02:00:35.161 --> 02:00:37.363
THAT THE STRIKE THAT WE RECENTLY

02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:38.464
HAD AN LA.

02:00:38.531 --> 02:00:39.332
THE STRIKE THAT COULD

02:00:39.398 --> 02:00:41.267
POTENTIALLY HAPPEN IN OAKLAND

02:00:41.334 --> 02:00:42.401
THE VERY COURAGEOUS

02:00:42.468 --> 02:00:44.236
CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE HAPPENING

02:00:44.303 --> 02:00:46.205
IN SACRAMENTO CITY ARE NOT

02:00:46.272 --> 02:00:47.907
BECAUSE OF PENSIONS BETTER

02:00:47.974 --> 02:00:49.875
BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF SYSTEMIC

02:00:49.942 --> 02:00:52.244
SUPPORT. FOR EDUCATION AND WE

02:00:52.311 --> 02:00:53.846
DON'T THINK THAT IT'S A CRIME

02:00:53.913 --> 02:00:55.481
FOR EDUCATORS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

02:00:55.548 --> 02:00:57.617
A SALARY TO ALLOW THEM TO LIVE

02:00:57.683 --> 02:00:58.751
IN THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY

02:00:58.818 --> 02:00:59.552
SERVE.

02:00:59.619 --> 02:01:00.886
AND EVEN IF THEY GET THOSE

02:01:00.953 --> 02:01:02.855
INCREASES THAT WOULD STILL NOT

02:01:02.922 --> 02:01:04.724
ONLY NOT ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN

02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:06.459
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WITH THEIR

02:01:06.525 --> 02:01:08.828
TRULY ASKING FOR SYSTEMIC

02:01:08.894 --> 02:01:10.329
SUPPORT IN THE CLASSROOM.

02:01:10.396 --> 02:01:11.998
SO THAT DISTRICTS CAN OFFER THE

02:01:12.064 --> 02:01:13.833
SUPPORT IN THE CLASSROOM BEFORE

02:01:13.899 --> 02:01:16.235
AND AFTER SCHOOL AS WELL AS TO

02:01:16.302 --> 02:01:18.104
MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMUNITIES

02:01:18.170 --> 02:01:19.438
NEEDS ARE HEARD --

02:01:19.505 --> 02:01:20.606
AND THEY'RE ALSO WANT TO MAKE

02:01:20.673 --> 02:01:22.875
SURE THAT THE ENCROACHMENT OF

02:01:22.942 --> 02:01:24.343
THE COST OF INCREASING OF

02:01:24.410 --> 02:01:25.911
CHARTER SCHOOLS ALSO DOESN'T

02:01:25.978 --> 02:01:27.913
INHIBIT THE DISTRICT'S ABILITY

02:01:27.980 --> 02:01:28.781
TO SERVE THE STUDENTS AND WHAT

02:01:28.848 --> 02:01:29.749
THEY NEED SO.

02:01:29.815 --> 02:01:31.884
BY SUPPORTING INTO THREE HUNDRED

02:01:31.951 --> 02:01:33.519
OUT THE THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN

02:01:33.586 --> 02:01:35.287
CAL STIRS WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS

02:01:35.354 --> 02:01:36.789
GIVING OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS MORE

02:01:36.856 --> 02:01:38.257
SUPPORT TO MAKE SURE ALL

02:01:38.324 --> 02:01:39.425
STUDENTS CAN GET SERVE

02:01:39.492 --> 02:01:41.260
HOLISTICALLY AND WE THINK THE

02:01:41.327 --> 02:01:42.928
GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP FOR THAT.

02:01:42.995 --> 02:01:44.630
