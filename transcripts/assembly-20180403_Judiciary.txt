TO THE ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE FOR TUESDAY APRIL THIRD I USUALLY DO NOT LIKE TO START THE COMMITTEE WITHOUT. A MEMBER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HERE WITH US BUT THEY HAVE NOT YET JOINED US COME TOLD THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY BUT WE'RE GONNA GET STARTED AS A SUB COMMITTEE. AND THE FIRST BILL WE'RE GOING TO HEAR IS ITEM NUMBER FIVE AB TWENTY TO SEVENTY FOUR MISTER QUIRK. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WILL BE ACCEPTING ALL THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS AND WOULD LIKE TO THANK COMMITTEE. FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THESE THOUGHTFUL AMENDMENTS. AB TWENTY TO SEVENTY FOUR CHANGES HOW COURTS RESOLVE PET OWNERSHIP CASES. ARE SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL EMPOWERS JUDGES TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE CARE FOR PETS. DETERMINING SOUL OR JOINT OFF AUTHORSHIP. CALIFORNIA'S A COMMUNITY PROPERTY STATE ALL COMMUNITY PROPERTY. AND DEBT ACQUIRED FROM THE DATE OF A MARRIAGE AND TOLD THE. MARSHALL CUT OFF DATE. IS. DIVIDED AND DISTRIBUTED EQUALLY. DIVISIONS PROPERTY INCLUDES PETS LIKE MANY PET OWNERS AYE VIEW MY PET AS MEMBER OF THE FAMILY. WELL THIS. DOES NOT CHANGE YOUR PETS LEGAL CHARACTERISED CHARACTERIZATION AS PROPERTY IT DOES GIVE GUIDANCE TO THE COURT. COURTS ARE MAKING PET OWNERSHIP DETERMINATIONS YEAH OUTCOMES ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM COURT TO COURT. BECAUSE OF A LACK OF GUIDANCE IN CALIFORNIA LAW. AB TWENTY TO SEVENTY FOUR TO REMEDY THIS. WITH WITH ME TODAY IS BRANDY CONSUL. OUT WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO SPCA AND I SEE WE ALSO HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL HERE. THANK YOU. AND I WENT UP. THANK YOU WELL WE'RE GONNA PAUSE IN. ESTABLISH A COURT IF YOU CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE HERE CUNNINGHAM CHAO. CHIU. GONZALEZ FLETCHER. HOLDEN KALRA. KILEY MAIENSCHEIN HERE RATES. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A QUORUM. THEY YOU THERE IS A MOTION IS THEIR SECOND. AND A SECOND AND THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I'M BRANDY CANCEL GENERAL COUNSEL OF THE SAN FRANCISCO SPCA AMERICA'S FOURTH. OLDEST HUMANE SOCIETY. DIVORCE IS ONE A MOST COMMON REASONS THAT PEOPLE OF SURRENDER THEIR PETS TO SHELTERS LIKE THE ONE THAT THE SAN FRANCISCO SPCA OPERATES. CURRENTLY JUDGES IN DIVORCE CASES TREAT PETS LIKE COMPUTERS ARE COUCHES THAT IS THERE JUST PIECES OF PROPERTY TO AK AWARD TO ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER BASS ANA HOPEFULLY EQUITABLE DIVISION OF PROPERTY. THIS APPROACH IS JUST A POOR FIT FOR DISPUTE INVOLVING BELOVED PETS THE BOND BETWEEN PETS AND HUMANS IS OFTEN LOST IN NEGOTIATIONS OUR PETS BECOME PAWNS AND PROTRACTED NEGOTIATIONS OF IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH UNBALANCED. POWER SITUATIONS THIS OFTEN MEANS EXPENSIVE AND PROLONG DISPUTES ABOUT PETS IN OUR FUTURE. ANIMALS ARE AS MR QUIRK SAID A LEGAL MATTER PERSONAL PROPERTY IN CALIFORNIA AB TWENTY TO SEVENTY FOUR DOESN'T CHANGE THIS AT ALL. THE IDEA BEHIND THIS MEASURE IS THAT SIMPLY THAT ANIMALS ARE A SPECIAL TYPE OF PROPERTY WORTHY OF SPECIAL CONSIDERATION UNDER THE LAW. NONE OF US CAN SPEWED THE OBVIOUS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A DOG AND COUCH. OR THE UNIQUE FACTORS THAT GO INTO A DECIDING WHERE PET GOES IN DIVORCE IT'S AS CLEAR DISTINGUISH THIS THIS THIS DISTINGUISHING FEATURE BETWEEN PROPERTY TYPES THAT IS CURRENTLY UNRECOGNIZED IN DIVORCE LAW. THAT AB TWENTY TO SEVENTY FOUR SEEKS TO REMEDY. AB TWO TWENTY FOUR IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LONG STANDING STATE NATIONAL POLICY OF TREATING ANIMALS UNIQUE AS UNIQUE PIECES OF PROPERTY CALIFORNIA HAS OVER ONE HUNDRED LAWS THAT TREAT ANIMALS DIFFERENT AND COUCHES. INCLUDING ANTI CRUELTY HUNTING REGULATIONS AND MANY MORE CALIFORNIANS RECOGNIZE THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY REMAIN PROPERTY ANIMALS MERITS SPECIAL CONSIDERATION UNDER THE LAW. AB TWENTY TWO A SEVENTY FOUR IS A CLOSE COUSIN TO FAMILY CODE SIXTY THREE TWENTY. WHICH WAS ENACTED JUST FOUR YEARS AGO. IT EXPRESSLY ALLOWS JUDGES TO INCLUDE PETS AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROTECTIVE ORDERS AND GET EXCLUSIVE CARE POSSESSION AND CONTROL TO ONE PERSON IN A RELATIONSHIP BEFORE THE COURT. THE LAW FIRM THE CONNECTION BETWEEN PEOPLE AND PETS IN THIS INSTANCE AND AB TWENTY TO SEVENTY FOUR REPRESENTS A VERY SIMILAR AFFIRMATION. WHEN CLOSE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS BECOME COME BEFORE THE COURTS AND PETS ARE INVOLVED WE SIMPLY WANT OUR JUDGES TO HAVE DISCRETION TO PAY SPECIAL HEED TO THE ANIMALS. PAKISTANI DISPUTES ARE ON THE RISE NOBODY TO MAKEYOUR DISPUTES THAT AND THEY'RE COSTLY TO COUPLES AND THE COURTS. WE'VE CITED A TWENTY FOURTEEN SURVEY CONDUCTED BY THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF MATRIMONIAL LAWYERS IN WHICH MORE THAN A QUARTER OF FAMILY LAW ATTORNEYS CITED AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CASES. BY CLARIFYING AND STREAMLINING THIS PROCESS FOR THE COURT'S AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY FOUR WILL HAVE A VALUABLE BENEFIT OF REDUCING PET RELATED DISPUTES. AND CONSERVING THE RESOURCES OF OUR ALREADY OVERTAXED COURT SYSTEM I URGE YOUR YES VOTE ON ABC TWENTY TO SEVENTY FOUR THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT IT'S WITH. IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING JENNIFER FEARING NOT HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF JUDICIAL COUNCIL THANK YOU CAN FACT HERE. ON BEHALF OF. THE CDA GO HUMANE SOCIETY BEST FRIENDS ANIMAL SOCIETY AND ALSO THE A SPC EXPRESSING STRONG SUPPORT IN URGING DRIVE VOTE THANK YOU. THINK MY MISTAKE. THAT ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MY NAME OWNERSHIP. MY NAME IS MICHELLE BROWN I'M A CERTIFIED FAMILY LAW SPECIALIST WHO'S BEEN PRACTICING LAW FOR OVER TWENTY FOUR YEARS. I AM THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE ASSOCIATION OF CERTIFIED FAMILY LAW SPECIALIST WERE COMPRISED OF OVER SIX HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE. CERTIFIED FAMILY LAW SPECIALIST ACROSS THE STATE AND WE OPPOSE THIS BILL NOT BECAUSE WE DON'T ALL LOVE ANIMALS I HAVE TWO CATS WHO I CONSIDER MY CHILDREN AS WELL. HOWEVER UNDER CURRENT LAW ANIMALS OUR COMMUNITY PROPERTY THEY ARE AN ASSET TO BE AWARDED TO EITHER A HUSBAND OR A WIFE. RIGHT NOW AS THE WITNESS IN SUPPORT STATED UNDER FAMILY CODE SECTION SIXTY THREE TWENTY BE IF THERE IS ABUSE. THEN THE COURT DEFINITELY HAS JURISDICTION TO AWARD AN ANIMAL TO ONE PARTY AND IT'S USUALLY THE VICTIM TO ENSURE THAT THAT ANIMAL IS SAFE AND FREE FROM ANY HARM. BECAUSE IN THOSE SITUATIONS AN ANIMAL CAN BE USED AS A PAWN THE COURT ALREADY HAS THAT DISCRETION ONE OF OUR MAIN CONCERNS HERE IS THE COURTS ARE ALREADY BACKLOG I WAS IN COURT JUST THIS WEEK ON A CUSTODY SITUATION WITH TWO SMALL CHILDREN. I CAN'T GET INTO COURT UNTIL THE END OF NOVEMBER. NOW WERE GOING TO BE ADDING CASSIE DISPUTES OVER CHILDREN I UNDERSTAND THE. THE STATISTICS THAT WERE RAISED BY THE WITNESS IN SUPPORT BUTTON TWENTY FOUR YEARS I'VE ONLY HAD ONE CASE WHERE THERE IS A REAL DISPUTE OVER A DOG JUST ONE IN TWENTY FOUR YEARS. NOW WE GOING TO BE HAVING JUDGES HAVING TO MAKE A DETERMINATION AS TO. JOINT OWNERSHIP CUSTODY VISITATION RIGHTS PEOPLE ARGUING OVER ANIMALS AND TAKING THE CHILDREN. AND THE LANE FROM NOW WHAT WERE FROM NOVEMBER MAYBE TELL NEXT YEAR SO THAT I CAN GET A HEARING ON CHILDREN FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOU KNOW VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE. QUESTIONS COMMENTS. ISRAEL. SO WHAT IS THE PROCEDURE NOW IF THERE IS A DISPUTE REGARDING A A PET A FAMILY PET. IT IN A DIVORCE O. DISSOLUTION PROCEEDINGS. IF YOU ARE IF EITHER PARTY IS BRINGS WOULD BRING A MOTION TO REQUESTED THE COURT WOULD HAVE THE JURISDICTION TO ISSUE AN INTERIM ORDER JUST AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN. THE JURISDICTION TO ISSUE AN INTERIM ORDER ON ANY OTHER PIECE OF PERSONAL PROPERTY WHAT USUALLY HAPPENS IN ALL HONESTY IS IF ONE PERSON WHO IS MORE ASSOCIATED ARE ALIGNED WITH THE PAT. EITHER REMAINS IN THE FAMILY RESIDENCE OR LEAVES THAT PERSON USUALLY TAKES THE PAT WITH HIM. AND AGAIN IN ALL HONESTY NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN WHOEVER HAS CUSTODY OF THE CHILDREN ARE PRIMARY CUSTODY USUALLY HAS THE PACKED WITH THEM BECAUSE THAT'S USUALLY ALIGNED WITH THE CHILD. AND I WOULD JUST ADD THAT. THIS BILL WOULDN'T CHANGE THAT BUT WHEN THERE IS A DISPUTE. IT GIVES THE CRITERIA CARRIED THE ANIMAL. AND THE PROBLEM WE HAVE IS THAT FROM COURT TO COURT THINGS VERY AND THIS GIVES THE JUDGE'S CRITERIA UNDER WHICH TO. MANAGE THAT SITUATION AND IF I MAY ADD AS WELL THAT THE IT THE SITUATION HERE IS THAT THE COURTS AREN'T SURE HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS AREA OF THE LAW RIGHT WE ALL KNOW THAT PETS ARE PERSONAL PROPERTY. BUT THERE'S SO MUCH IN THE MEDIA THERE SO MANY ARGUMENTS BE MADE BEFORE THE COURT BUT IT IT MUDDIES THE ISSUE. AND SO WE CONSIDER THIS ACTUALLY A RELIEF VALVE FOR THE BACKLOG OF CASES BECAUSE IT PROVIDES CLEAR DIRECTIVE TO THE COURTS ON HOW TO HANDLE THESE CASES. AND WE ALL KNOW THAT JUDGES ARE IN COMPLETE CONTROL OF THEIR COURTROOMS RIGHT SO THIS JUST IS WE WOULD THINK THAT THEY WOULD EMBRACE THIS PROCESS BECAUSE IT SIMPLIFIES AS IT PROVIDES A. VERY CLEAR DIRECTIVE AND. IT AND EXPEDITES IT IN A VERY EFFICIENT WAY. I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE COMMENTS WERE MADE ABOUT THE BACKLOG AND HOW THIS MIGHT INCREASE THE BACKLOG I WILL BE VOTING FOR THIS BUT I I WOULD REQUEST THAT THAT THAT THAT DISCUSSION CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THAT. THERE ISN'T THAT THAT WE'RE NOT. INCREASING THE BACKLOG FOR THE CHILDREN TO TAKE CARE VICIOUS REGARDING THE PETS THAT WOULD BE MY ONLY CONCERN BUT I WILL BE VOTING FOR TODAY. THANK YOU I'M GONNA HAVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. SO AS I UNDERSTAND THE AMENDED VERSION THE BILL SETS FORTH THE STANDARD THAT TAKES. SO SO JUDGE WOULD TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. THE CARE OF THE PET AND DEFINES CARES CERTAINLY. SO HOW IS THE JUDGE GOING TO DETERMINE. THAT. YOU AND UNDER. THE CONTEMPLATION OF THIS NEW PROCEDURE. WELL I THINK THAT THAT OUT OF GOPHERS BUT WE WOULD EXPECT THAT THE JUDGES WOULD MAKE THESE CONSIDERATIONS BASED ON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES BEFORE THEM IN A CASE JUST LIKE THEY WOULD ANY OTHER DECISION AND DIVIDING EQUITABLE COMMUNITY PROPERTY AND THE NOTION OF A PET CARE. CLINICAL CARE WE THINK IS STRAIGHTFORWARD ENOUGH THAT A TASK OF FOR A JUDGE WHO IS WELL VERSED IN TO THESE TYPES OF DECISIONS WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE. AGAIN ON THE FACTS BEFORE THEM SO. YOU KNOW THE FACTS WILL NEED TO BE WEIGHED CERTAINLY BUT THAT IS ALREADY BEING DONE THESE CASES ARE ARGUE THESE ISSUES ARE TO BE HEARD. AND IF I MAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER. EXACTLY WHAT THE WITNESS STATED IS OUR CONCERN. UNDER FAMILY CODE SECTION TWO SEVENTEEN ANY PERSON IS ENTITLED TO AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING. SO IF FAT MY SPOUSE AND I HAVE A DISPUTE OVER THE CAT I AM THEN ENTITLED TO AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING WHY MIGHT WANT TO BRING IN WITNESSES THE VETERINARIAN. A TO TESTIFIED THAT I CAN PROVIDE BETTER CARE FOR THE CAP WHICH WILL INCREASE THE BACKLOG THAT'S ONE OF OUR MAIN CONCERNS. GOOD DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT THOUGH THAT LOOK AT WORK OUT WE'RE WORKING WITH ADDITIONAL COUNSEL NOW. AND THEY HAVE THEY HAVE INDICATED TO US THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH US ON THE BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. AND SHOULD THEY DECIDE THAT HAPPENED THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM THEN I WOULD CERTAINLY RECONSIDER IT BUT WE'RE WORKING WITH JUDICIAL COUNCIL I THINK THEY'RE IN THE BEST POSITION TO MAKE THAT JUDGMENT AND I WILL BE FOLLOWING. WITH THEM ON THAT. OKAY I MEAN BUT IT'S STILL IT OCCURS TO ME THAT IF YOU'RE GONNA SET FORTH A NEW STANDARD. AND. ALLOW AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING POTENTIALLY ARE EITHER PARTY TO REQUEST ONE TO SAY HEY I CAN TAKE CARE FIND A BETTER THAN THAN. HERE SHE CAN TAKE CARE OF FIDO. THEN HOW ARE YOU NOT INCREASING THE BACKLOG IF YOU HAVE MORE GLARING THAN ANOTHER ISSUE HERE CAN BE REQUESTED IN ANY CASE UNDER CURRENT LAW EVEN WITHOUT THIS. YEAH BUT NOT NOW SETTING FORTH A NEW STANDARD THAT'S GOTTA BE THAT'S GOTTA BE LITIGATED SO I I GUESS I. TO. MS RAISE THIS QUESTION I'VE GOT THE SAME CONCERN LIKE YOU'VE GOT A BACKLOG ALREADY OF CASES INVOLVING CUSTODY WITH CHILDREN. RIGHT I MEAN I DON'T THINK ANYBODY CAN DISPUTE THAT THAT'S OF EVIDENTIARY FACT IN THE WORLD ANOTHER. I MEAN MY WIFE PRACTICES FAMILY LAW SHE'S HAVING THE SAME ISSUES. TRYING TO GET HEARINGS FOR FOR CUSTODY CASES. AND DISPUTES. INVOLVING YOUNG KIDS AND IN THIS TAKE TREMENDOUS ABOUT TIME GOT A CALL EXPERTS GOT IT PSYCHOLOGISTS AND. NOW YOU'RE ADDING A NEW. POTENTIAL SET HOWEVER I DON'T KNOW HOW BIG THE SET IS BUT YOU'RE ADDING A NEW POTENTIAL SAT DISPUTES. INVOLVING ANIMALS SO HOW ARE YOU NOT CAN INCREASE THE BACKLOG. THE UP AGAIN AS THE CHAIR SAID YOU CAN STILL ASK FOR THAT WITHOUT THIS WHAT THIS DOES IS SET A STANDARD. AND DUBBED WE ARE WORKING WITH JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND THEY ARE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT BACKLOGS THAN ANYONE ELSE'S. AND I THINK THERE WOULD BE A AND I'VE E. IT EXACTLY I THINK THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU GET TO THE OTHER QUESTION. IS GONZALEZ FLETCHER I'M I'M ALSO I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. BACKLOG ANYBODY WHO HAS BEEN IN FAMILY COURT. OF LAST YEAR'S CAN TELL YOU ESPECIALLY IF YOU GO THROUGH A PUBLIC. PROCESS. HOW LONG YOU WAIT FOR THESE DETERMINATIONS TO BE MADE AND I'M HOW UPSETTING? I HAD INTERMEDIATE SITUATION AS ON FAMILIES AND CHILDREN. AND I'M ALSO CONCERNED THAT THIS IS KIND OF OPENING UP THIS ENTIRE NEW POINT OF LEVERAGE. IN IN OTHER IN. DIVORCE DISPUTE AND. AND IN DIVORCES DISPUTES ESPECIALLY WHEN OUR CHILDREN INVOLVED. SOMETIMES PROVIDING ANOTHER POINT OF LEVERAGE. FOR THE I HAVE. FOR. THE INDIVIDUAL WHO MAYBE HAS MORE RESOURCES TO TO GO THROUGH I I AM JUST IMAGINING THAT THERE WILL BE. PET PSYCHOLOGIST PRIDE AND THAT THERE WERE I MEAN THAT THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN RIGHT THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE. CUSTODY ARRANGEMENTS MADE AND THEN SOMEBODY'S GONNA WANT TO MOVE AWAY ORDER I MEAN I CAN IMAGINE AND I'M SORRY BECAUSE I'VE SEEN KIND OF THE CHANGE IN HOW PEOPLE DEAL WITH. THEIR PETS AND THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE A COURT SYSTEM THAT SET UP RIGHT NOW TO DEAL WITH OUR CHILDREN. MAKES ME REALLY A. CONCERNED ABOUT THE SPELL I'M NOT GONNA VOTE ON IT TODAY. I'VE I'M NOT GONNA VOTE AGAINST LAYOFF I I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING HOPEFULLY AM FROM JUDICIAL COUNCIL BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING I CAN SUPPORT TODAY. I'M HAVING HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING IN FUELING COURT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IN AND SEEN HOW LONG AND TO SEE QUITE FRANKLY OW HOW CAN BE USED FAMILY COURT AS. JUST LEVERAGE ON OTHER ISSUES BECAUSE ANYBODY WHO'S DEALT WITH DIVORCES NOW. HOW PAINFUL THAT CAN BE AND AND HOW MUCH LEVERAGES OFF AND UTILIZED? IN ANY FORM AVAILABLE TO A PERSON WHO HAS MOST MOUNT MONEY SO. I'M I'M GONNA LAY OFF OF IT TODAY I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO I WANT TO BE THERE I JUST I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS WITHOUT GETTING. A FULL UNDERSTAND FROM JUDICIAL COUNCIL OF. WHAT THIS WOULD LOOK LIKE AND HOW THIS WOULD AFFECT THE COURT? LET. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. CUNNINGHAM. THANK YOU MISTER SO. AS I UNDERSTAND IT THOUGH THE. IN ADDITION TO CLARIFYING A STANDARD OR SETTING STANDARDS. YOU YOU WOULD ALSO ENABLE A JUDGE TO TO DO SOME SORT OF JOINT CUSTODY. YEAH RANGE OF THE PAT. I MEAN THAT. TO ME THAT FURTHER COMPOUNDS THE CONCERNS OVER BACKLOG BECAUSE NOW YOU'VE GOT A CUSTODY ORDER AND SOMEBODY NEEDS TO DROP OFF I DON'T FIVE O'CLOCK ON FRIDAY. AND THEY DON'T SHOW UP. AND THEN YOU GOT PEOPLE RUNNING IN THE COURT TO TRY TO GET IN. THAT ORDER ENFORCED AND IT SEEMS LIKE THAT THERE WOULD BE A PROLIFERATION. OF LITIGATION LIKE YOU SEE IN CUSTODY DISPUTES OVER CHILDREN. OVER PETS IS THAT A CONCERN THAT. YOU GUYS ARE ARE CONSIDERING. GO AHEAD. THANK YOU AND AM MISTER CHAIR MISTER CUNNINGHAM AND IN FACT AND JENNIFER FEARING AGAIN I WE JUST SPOKE WITH JUDICIAL COUNCIL. IN THAT IN THE AUDIENCE BEFORE THAT'S AND LEARN ABOUT A DEATH THAT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE AND HAVE COMMITTED TO WORKING DIRECTLY WITH THEM TO AVOID. MAKE SURE THAT IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT ONCE THE COURT ORDERS UNDER THAT'S WHICH AGAIN THEY ALREADY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO WERE JUST TRYING TO RUN TRYING TO PROMOTE OR ACCELERATE. THESE TYPES OF DISPUTES RETURN TO CREATE A PATHWAY I'M A STANDARD TO MAKE IT GO BETTER AND FASTER SO WE WE DO FEEL ABOUT WORK WHICH INITIAL COUNCIL WE CAN GET THE THOUGHT OF A PLACE THAT IT RESOLVES. THE CONCERN YOU'RE HAVING NOT EXACERBATES IT A BUT AND WE CERTAINLY CAN HANDLE. WORKING WITH JUDICIAL COUNCIL ON THIS JOINT CUSTODY ARRANGEMENT UNDERSTAND THAT ONCE THE JUDGE ORDERS THAT'S THE END OF THE. UC FAMILY COURTS AND DEALING WITH THIS MATTER IN ANY. ONE LAST COMMENT ON THAT. IF YOU LOOK IN SUB SECOND YOU MIGHT WANT TO OWN A MICROPHONE THERE THINK KIM. IF YOU LOOK IN SUBSECTION A OF THE BILL IT DOES TALK ABOUT PRIOR TO THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF OWNERSHIP OF THE PET ANIMAL. AND THEN YOU HAVEYOUR JUDGMENT DETERMINATION SO IN THIS INSTANCE YOU COULD HAVE SOMEONE FILING A REQUEST FOR ORDER. ASKING FOR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING ON DEPEND ENTIRELY DAY ORDER FOR SOLAR JOINT OWNERSHIP OF THE PAT AND THEN ALSO DEALING WITH IT AGAIN AT THE TIME OF THE FINAL TRIAL. THANK YOU. THE OTHER QUESTIONS. COMMENTS. ALRIGHT SEEING NONE ESCORT YOU MAKE CLOTHES YEAH LET ME SAY THAT I WILL NOT ALLOW THE BILL TO GO FORWARD IF IT RESULTS IN A SUBSTANTIAL. YEAH A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE CURRENT BACKLOG PERIOD. I WORK WITH JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO PREVENT THAT. I LET ME JUST SAY NOW THAT. WELL AB TWENTY TO SEVENTY FOUR MAKES IT CHANGES. IT'S NOT A HUGE WIND AND IT DOESN'T OPEN DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS TO ANYTHING THAT HAS NOT BEEN PART OF IT SUCH CASES PREVIOUSLY. OUR JUDGES ARE IN COMPLETE CONTROL OF THEIR COURTROOM AND WE ARE NOT COMPARING THIS WITH THE CHILD. CUSTODY BATTLE WITH THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD. ARE CONSIDERED WITH EXTENDED TESTIMONY. I. AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY FOUR NAY THEIR SETS UP ANY KIND OF PROCESS LIKE THAT. NOR PROMOTES IT RATHER IT PUTS THE DECISION MAKING AUTHORITY IN THE HANDS OF THE JUDGE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY. PROVIDES GUIDANCE SO THINGS WILL NOT VERY FROM COURT TO COURT AND AGAIN I PLEDGE NOT IN ANY WAY TO INCREASE. THE BACK BACK LIKE SHOULD IN ANY SUBSTANTIAL WAY. THANK YOU. SO THERE IS A MOTION TO SECOND THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. STONE BY STONE AYE CUNNINGHAM. CUNNINGHAM NO CHOW. CHOW I CHU CHU AYE GONZALEZ FLETCHER. HOLDEN.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I'M HERE PRESENTE BE TWENTY THREE EIGHTY NINE WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA STAFF. AND STUDENTS TO USE STATE FUNDS TRAVELED COLLEGIATE CONFERENCES COMPETITIONS I AS WELL AS ATHLETIC COMPETITIONS THERE CURRENTLY BANNED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHEN THE STATE FUNDED BAN ON TRAVEL WAS ENACTED THE AUTHOR THE BILL DID NOT INTEND CREE PROBLEMS WITH THE SCIENTIFIC OF AN ATHLETIC COMMUNITIES. IN MY OF BELIEF UNFORTUNATELY THIS TRAVEL BAN AFFECTS STAFF AND STUDENTS AT STUDENTS FROM ACROSS THE STATE. SUCH AS UCLA SAN JOSE STATE AND CAL POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO. STUDENTS WHO STRUGGLE WITH FOOD AND SECURITY IN EXPENSIVE RENTS ARE NOW PROHIBITED FROM RECEIVING STATE FUNDS. TO ATTEND EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH CONFERENCES UC DAVIS SENIOR MARK RIVERA WHICH ONE OF THE MANY COLLEGE STUDENTS IMPACTED BY THE TRAVEL BAN. HERE AT LEAST SEVENTEEN OTHER STUDENTS WERE UNABLE PRESENT THEIR RESEARCH AT A NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH LAST YEAR. SINCE WAS HELD AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS IN TENNESSEE. STUDENTS FROM CAL POLY CHAPTER ON THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION MINORITY ARCHITECTS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO ATTEND THE CONFERENCE LAST OCTOBER IN HOUSTON TEXAS. THEY MISTER OUT ON OPPORTUNITIES PARTICIPATING DESIGN COMPETITIONS AND POSSIBLY LAND INTERNSHIPS WITH SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES. IN ADDITION COLLEGE ATHLETES WERE PREVENTED FROM FACING THE BEST COMPETITION THE NATION. JUST LAST YEAR UC BERKELEY'S MEN BASKETBALL TEAM WAS FORCED TO WITHDRAW FROM SCHEDULING TWO GAME SERIES WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS. CALIFORNIA'S PLAYING POLITICS. EDUCATION CAREERS OF COLLEGE STUDENTS AND IT IS THE STUDENTS WHO ARE LOSING OUT. WHEN PRESIDENT CARTER ANNOUNCED THE UNITED STATES WOULD BOYCOTT. THE NINETEEN EIGHTY OLYMPIC GAMES IT WAS THE OLYMPIC ATHLETES WHO MISSED OUT ON THE OPTING FOR THE GOAL. THE BOYCOTT DID NOTHING TO CHANGE THE POLICIES OF SOVIET UNION. IN NINETEEN THIRTY SIX THERE WAS A DISCUSSION OF WHAT CAUGHT. OF THE OLYMPICS IN* GERMANY US DECIDED AGAINST. AT THOSE GAMES JESSE OWENS. ONE FOUR GOLD MEDALS AND DEMONSTRATED THAT ENGAGEMENT. NOT ISOLATION. THE BEST WAY TO CHANGE MINE. LIKE THOSE OLYMPIC ATHLETES. THESE COLLEGE STUDENTS MAY HAVE ONE CHANCE TO LEARN AND COMPETE AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. WE SHOULD NOT TAKE THAT OPPORTUNITY FROM THE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I'VE. THANK YOU. YOUR WITNESS IN SUPPORT. NO IS IS WHAT WOULD ANYONE LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS JOHN MICHAEL FOR EQUALITY CALIFORNIA. AND WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL EQUALITY CALIFORNIA BRINGS THE VOICES OF LESBIAN GAY BISEXUAL TRANSGENDER AND QUEER LGBTQ PEOPLE AND ALLIES TO INSTITUTIONS OF POWER IN CALIFORNIA. AND ACROSS THE UNITED STATES STRIVING TO CREATE A WORLD THAT IS HEALTHY JUST AND FULLY EQUAL FOR ALL LGBTQ PEOPLE. WE ADVANCE CIVIL RIGHTS AND SOCIAL JUSTICE BY INSPIRING ADVOCATING AND MOBILIZING THROUGH AN INCLUSIVE MOVEMENT THAT WORKS TIRELESSLY ON BEHALF OF THOSE WE SERVE. AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW IN TWENTY SIXTEEN PROHIBITS STATE AGENCIES AND THE LEGISLATURE FROM APPROVING STATE FUNDED OR SPONSOR TRAVEL TO A STATE THAT AFTER JUNE TWENTY SIX TWENTY FIFTEEN. HAS ENACTED A LOT THAT VOIGTS OR REPEALS EXISTING STATE LAW OR LOCAL PROTECTIONS AGAINST DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION GENDER IDENTITY GENDER EXPRESSION OR HAS ENACTED A LAW THAT AUTHORIZES A REQUIRES DISCRIMINATION. AGAINST SAME SEX COUPLES OR THEIR FAMILIES ON THE SPACEY'S. EXEMPTED FROM THE LAW IS TRAVEL THAT IS NECESSARY TO ENFORCE STATE LAW REQUIRED BY EXISTING CONTRACTS OR THAT'S NECESSARY TO PRINT PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH WELFARE OR SAFETY. AYE AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY NINE WOULD UNDERMINE AB EIGHTEEN NINETY SEVEN BY ADDING ADDITIONAL UNNECESSARY EXCEPTIONS FOR CERTAIN KINDS OF STATE FUNDED TRAVEL. THE EXEMPTIONS THAT ARE BUILT INTO AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN ARE BASED ON THE CRITERIA THAT THE STATE LEVEL DECISION MAKERS ALREADY USE TO DETERMINE TO DETERMINE WHETHER STATE FUNDED TRAVEL IS NECESSARY. AND THAT WHETHER IT SERVES THE INTERESTS OF THE STATE. THE ADDITIONAL EXCEPTIONS THAT THIS BILL WOULD ADD ARE NOT NECESSARY IN PART BECAUSE STATE FUNDS ARE RARELY USED TO SUPPORT STATE TRAVEL FOR. YOU KNOW I'VE TO SUPPORT TRAVEL FOR STATE UNIVERSITY ATHLETICS AND ACADEMIC COMPETITIONS FUNDS FOR THIS TRAVEL TYPICALLYCOME FROM OTHER REVENUE SOURCES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE EXAMPLES THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER HARPER CITED AND WE'VE ACTUALLY HEARD OF A NUMBER OF SITUATIONS WHERE PEOPLE. HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TRAVEL USING OTHER FUNDING SOURCES THIS IS REALLY ABOUT USING STATE FUNDS FOR THIS TRAVEL. I'M MOST IMPORTANTLY THE ADDITIONAL EXEMPTIONS EVEN IF THEY WOULD RARELY BE USED CHIP AWAY AT THE IMPORTANT STATEMENT THAT AB EIGHTEEN NINETY SEVEN MAKES. BY ALLOWING CALIFORNIA TAX DOLLARS TO BENEFIT STATES THAT ENGAGE IN BLATANT DISCRIMINATION UNDER MORE AND MORE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT'S REALLY OUR CONCERN HERE IS THAT THIS. UNDERMINES THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AND THE STATEMENT THAT IT MAKES DONT THE EXEMPTIONS THAT WERE ABOUT BUILDING INITIALLY WE BELIEVE COVER SITUATIONS THAT WILL ARISE WHERE STATE FUNDING DOES NEED TO BE USED FOR TRAVEL TO THE STATES. AND THAT THERE SHOULD BE OTHER FUNDING SOURCES AVAILABLE FOR TRAVEL THAT DOESN'T USE CALIFORNIA STATE DOLLARS TO BENEFIT STATES THAT COULD DISCRIMINATE AGAINST CALIFORNIANS WHEN THEY ARE THERE IN THAT STATE. AYE AND GENERALLY ARE BEING USED TO FRANKLY SUPPORT THE DISCRIMINATION AT THE STATE'S ENGAGING AND SO WE ARE SURE OPPOSITION TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. IT'S A NOT BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. WAS HARPER AM RECOMMENDING A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL I DO FIND IT TO BE. UNNECESSARY. INFRINGEMENT ON THE STATE LAW THAT WAS WE JUST RECENTLY PASSED. ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTION. THE TRIP. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ALSO BE JOINING. THE CHAIR IN OPPOSING THIS BILL I. DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY. CERTAINLY WITH THE CONTINUE DISCRIMINATION AND WOULD ALSO JUST POINT OUT THAT. EXPERIENCE THAT WE SAW IN NORTH CAROLINA AFTER IT. PASSED. IT VERY. DISCRIMINATORY BILL AGAINST. LGBT RESIDENTS IN THAT STATE. WHEN THE NCAA DECIDED TO BOYCOTT THE STATE IT HAD A VERY REAL IMPACT AND IN MOVING OF THAT LAW INTO A BETTER DIRECTION AND SO I THINK WE HAVE SEEN. WHAT THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF THE BILL THAT WE HAD PASSED PREVIOUSLY I AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT? TO USE THE WORDS OF THE AUTHOR TO PROMOTE INCLUSION AND. AND INCLUSIVITY AND TOLERANCE. THROUGHOUT OUR COUNTRY TO TO USE WHAT PURCHASING POWER THAT WE MIGHT HAVE. TO TO HAVE THAT IMPACTS WITH THAT I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. YOU EITHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM ME. ALRIGHT CIGNA MISTER HARPER YOU MAKE CLOTHES THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'VE MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. I I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT OINT OUT THAT THE STATES THAT ARE CURRENTLY LISTED. BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT FIT INTO THIS INCLUDE ALABAMA KANSAS KENTUCKY MISSISSIPPI. STILL NORTH CAROLINA. I EVEN THOUGH THAT LAW HAS CHANGED IT'S POINTED OUT OF BY THE MEMBER FROM SAN FRANCISCO SOUTH DAKOTA AYE TENNESSEE. AND TEXAS. YOU WERE TAKE CALIFORNIA. AS WELL AS THE CAL STATE UNIVERSITIES WERE TREATING. FROM COMPETITION WITH THE BEST FROM COMPETITION BOUGHT FROM CONFERENCES WITH THE BEST. PEOPLE ENGAGE AND OFTEN GO TO OUR UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA AND CAL STATE. TO BE WHAT THE BEST AND ATTEMPTED AGAINST THE BEST BUT INSTEAD. CURRENT LAW. IS A RETREAT FROM. AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO IMPACT OUR PROGRAMS BOTH ATHLETICALLY AS WELL AS ACADEMICALLY. AND WE'VE SEEN THAT IMPACT HAPPEN. NOT EVERYONE CAN BUY INDULGENCES IF YOU WILL. AND FIND PRIVATE FUNDING. FURTHER DIVISION TO DIVISION THREE. UP OR ACADEMIC COMPETITIONS WELL WEALTHY PROGRAMS SUCH AS DIVISION ONE ATHLETICS AT POPULAR PAKA COMBA TWELVE COMPETITION SCHOOLS MAY BE ABLE TO. BY THOSE INDULGENCES TO BE ABLE TO PAY THEIR WAY THROUGH. JUST AS IN THE LAST BILL. THE ARGUMENT WAS. SHOULD WE HAVE. COURT SIR. INITIATE SHOULD THE PETS BE PAWNS. IN. IT IN IN DISPUTES BETWEEN. HOT FORMER MARITAL PARTNERS. WE HAVE A SITUATION HERE'S SHOULD OUR STUDENTS. BE PAWNS IN POLITICAL DISPUTES BOB BETWEEN DIFFERENT STATES WITHIN THE UNION. I AGREE. CALIFORNIA'S MESSAGE CAN BE SPOT SPREAD BUT I SAW EVERY MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE. APPLY. WHEN ABOUT THE SAME TIME THAT THIS BILL WAS PASSED. WHEN THE NATIONAL GAY MEN'S CHORUS CAME AND PERFORM. THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY. AND THEY. SAID THAT THE NEXT THING THAT THEY'RE GONNA DO IS TRAVEL TO NORTH CAROLINA. NEVER ONE HERE APPLAUDED THAT. INSTEAD OF CALLING FOR A BOYCOTT. SO WITH THAT I CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK UP YOUR VOTE FOR THIS BILL. AYE AND ALLOW US. TO ALL NOT ALLOW US TO SEE THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AND THE CAL STATE STUDENTS. TO BE ABLE COMPETE WITH THE BEST AMONG THE BEST AND NOT RETREAT. AND HOW THAT COMPETE ARE I CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR ACADEMICS AND ATHLETIC EXPERIENCE.

THE AMENDMENT ON PAGE FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS WITH APPRECIATION AND THANKS TO A YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR THEIR WORK TO HELP CLARIFY THE INTENT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ONE LET MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THAT MORE THAN FOUR MILLION TRAFFIC INFRACTIONS ARE ISSUED IN CALIFORNIA EVERY SINGLE YEAR MAKING UP APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE CRIMINAL FILINGS IN OUR STATE. I WOULD CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF FAILING TO APPEAR IN COURT NOT TO MENTION FAILURE TO PAY ADDITIONAL FINES OVER A MINOR TRAFFIC INFRACTIONS. SUCH AS DRIVING WITHOUT A WORKING TAIL LIGHT FOR RUNNING A STOP SIGN I BELIEVE THAT IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO LOOK AT NEW WAYS OF ADJUDICATING. MINOR TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE REMAINS APPRISED OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCILS EFFORTS TO DEVELOP A CIVIL MODEL UP WITH ADJUDICATION OF THESE KINDS OF VIOLATIONS. WITH PUBLIC HEARINGS AND REGULAR PROGRESS REPORTS ULTIMATELY RESULTING IN A PROPOSAL AYE IF ADVISABLE. I WITH ME THIS MORNING IN THE INTEREST OF TIME IS CHAIRMAN OF IS OUT AND IT WOULDN'T BE BEEN BOND.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT HAS BEEN AND SHALL CONTINUE TO BE A DELIBERATE OPEN AND ROBUST PROCESS FOR THIS EFFORT.

WE ALWAYS STRIVE TO ENSURE THAT VOICES ARE HEARD ALTERNATIVES AND OPTIONS ARE FULLY CONSIDERED. I AM ONE ARRIVE AT THE BEST POSSIBLE PRODUCT AND THAT IS IN FACT THE WORK THAT ALL JUDICIAL OFFICER STRIVE TO ACHIEVE. AND THE WORK OF THE FUTURES TRAFFIC WORKING GROUP IS NO DIFFERENT. AND THAT'S AMONG THE MANY REASONS THAT WE. SPONSORED THE BILL AND AND WE ARE MUCH A GRATEFUL FOR ASSEMBLYMEMBER GLORIA'S LEADERSHIP. WE'VE SUBMITTED A ROBUST LIST OF STAKEHOLDERS WHO HAVE TO DATE OF PARTICIPATED IN SOME ITERATION OF THE PROCESS.

WHY IS A COULD JUDICIAL COUNCIL DO THIS WITHOUT THIS LEGISLATION ACQUIRES THE BILL NECESSARY? THE YES THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL COULD HAVE THE FUTURE TRAFFIC WORKING GROUP CONTINUE ITS PROCESS WITH OUT LEGISLATION REQUIRING REPORTING BACK. THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES IN THE PAST WHERE THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN CONCERNED THAT HASN'T BEEN PROPERLY ENGAGED WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WHAT'S SOMETHING AS SENSITIVE AND SWEEPING AS THE. POTENTIAL TRANSITION FROM CRIMINAL TO CIVIL ADJUDICATION OF TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS THAT AS MANY INTERESTED ENTITIES ARE ENGAGED AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE OBVIOUSLY THE LEGISLATURE. OKAY I JUST I I THINK I'M THINKING PROSPECTIVELY TOWARDS NEXT COMMITTEE MORE AND KIND OF MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT. THAT THE COST OF. OF A BILL LIKE THIS THAT MAYBE AT BECOMES A STATE MANDATE RATHER THEM SO THE BILL ITSELF AS WRITTEN I DON'T BELIEVE IT THE THERE'S NO COST TO OUR PLANNING PROCESS. THERE MAY BE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE IF FUTURES TRAFFIC WORKING GROUP RECOMMENDS TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL CHANGES TO CODE TO STATUTE TO THE RULES OF COURT. THAT MAY CARRY WITH THAT PRICE TAG. BUT WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW IS A PLANNING PROCESS TRYING TO IDENTIFY WHAT THOSE CHANGES MAY BE OR COULD BE AND WHAT THEY SHOULD LOOK LIKE. BUT WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY PROPOSING LEGISLATION RIGHT NOW WE DON'T INTEND TO PROPOSE LEGISLATION. PROBABLY BEFORE THAT TWENTY TWENTY ONE LEGISLATIVE SESSION. OKAY I THINK IT'S GOOD POLICY ADDRESS ABSOLUTE WAS THINKING FIRE AB AND WE WOULD TO WE APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER FLOOR'S YOURS GREAT THANK YOU AGAIN MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I'LL LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE CLARIFYING AMENDMENT AS PROPOSED BY THE COMMITTEE ON PAGE THREE OF THE ANNOUNCES. THE BILL AB TWENTY TWO NINETY EIGHT WOULD PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN THE RARE SITUATION WHEN IN WHICH HE JUST STATION ALL CARRIER. EXPERIENCES US SUPER FEE TATIAN AND GIVES BIRTH TO HER OWN BIOLOGICAL CHILD THE SAME TIME IS GIVING BIRTH TO THE BABY. OF AN INTENDED COUPLE. IN LATE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO WASHINGTON POST REPORTED ABOUT A CALIFORNIA WOMEN WHO HAD ENTERED INTO A CONTRACT TO BE A JUST STATION ALL. CARRIER FOR A COUPLE AND EVENTUALLY DELIVERED THE COUPLE'S TWIN BABIES. ABOUT A MONTH AFTER THE BABIES WERE BORN AND LIVING AND THEY'RE ALL NEW HOME WITH THE INTENDED PARENTS DO JUST CREATION OR CARRIER RECEIVED A PICTURE. FROM THE TWINS SO MOTHER ASKING IF THE LEGISLATION ALL CARRIER HAD ANY CLUE AS TO WHY THE BABIES LOOKED NOTHING ALIKE. DNA TEST SO TAKEN SHORTLY THEREAFTER REVEALED THAT ONE OF THEM. ONE OF THE TWINS WAS ACTUALLY THE BIOLOGICAL SON OF THE JUST ISSUED A CARRIER. THE CARRIER HAD EXPERIENCED A RARE MEDICAL CONDITION CALLED SUPER FEET HAITIAN IN WHICH SHE CARRIED. BOTH A FETUS THAT WAS BIOLOGICALLY CONNECTED TO HER CONCEIVED THROUGH INTERCOURSE AND FETUS. ARE BIOLOGICALLY CONNECTED TO THE INTENDED PERRANCE THAT HAD BEEN IMPLANTED THROUGH ASSISTED REPRODUCTION. AS IT TURNED OUT THAT YOUR STATION A CARRIER HAD UNINTENTIONALLY GIVEN AWAY HER A PARENTAL RIGHTS TO BE THAT SHE HAD NO IDEA WAS BIOLOGICALLY. HERS SO AFTER A LONG LEGAL BATTLE THE I JUST PATIENT CARY WAS ABLE TO RETAIN HER BIOLOGICAL SON. HOWEVER THE LEGISLATION IS NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT A MOTHER OUT CANNOT RELINQUISH ALL THE RIGHTS TO A BIOLOGICAL CHILD THAT SHE DOESN'T KNOW IS HERS. SO WITH THAT IN MIND AB TWENTY TWO NINETY EIGHT WOULD REQUIRE THAT ASSISTED REPRODUCTION AGREEMENTS CONTAIN. A DISCLOSURE WHICH STATES THAT ANY CHILD THAT IS CONCEIVED BY TO JUST THEY SHOULD ALL CARRIER THROUGH SEXUAL INTERCOURSE IS INDEED THE CHILD OF THE JUST ASIAN OR CARRIER. SO WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAP. ANYONE LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL.

REYES I. THANK YOU THAT BILL IS OUT. THEN WE'LL TAKE UP ITEM NUMBER THREE AB TWO OH FOUR FOUR WHICH IS MY BILL THIS MAIENSCHEIN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CHAIR. BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT. I CHAIR IS CAN BE SOME BIG CHANGES WHILE YOU. THAT THAT THAT BY APPROACH. AND I'M GOING TO REGRET THAT THEY GO OUT ON A GAVEL AND A GAVEL. SO REPUBLICANS DREAM RIGHT NOW. THANK MISTER CHAIR YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. CHAIR JUDICIARY MAIENSCHEIN. THAT. ISSUE AB TWENTY FOUR NEIGHBORING OR GREAT RING THAT YOU'VE GOT ONE YES VOTE RIGHT NOW. WE LIKE THAT. IS IS AN ATTEMPT TO TRY AND ENSURE THAT THAT CHILD SAFETY IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF ANY. CHILD CUSTODY DISPUTE. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CAN BE AND AND CHILD ABUSE OF VERY VERY SERIOUS ISSUES. AND WENT COUPLES ARE. CONTESTING IN DIVORCE CASES AND LOOKING FOR TAP CUSTODY. MAKING SURE THAT THAT CHILD IS SAFE AND THAT WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO. TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO THAT CHILD IS WHAT AB TWENTY FORTY FOUR IS ALL ABOUT. AS WE KNOW NOT JUST CHILD ABUSE BUT BUT BEING WITNESS TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS ALSO CHILD ABUSE. AND SO WHAT THIS BILL IS DOING IS TYING TOGETHER TO EXISTING CODE SECTIONS THAT GOVERN BOTH CHILD CUSTODY AND VISITATION DETERMINATIONS AND. AGAIN SETTING IT A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT STANDARD AROUND CHILD SAFETY CLARIFYING THAT THE PERPETUATION OF CHILD ABUSE AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND THE HOUSEHOLD WITH A CHILD RESIDES IS DETRIMENTAL TO THE HEALTH SAFETY AND WELFARE OF THAT CHILD. AND THAT CHILDREN HAVE A RIGHT TO BE SAFE AND FREE IF YOU. THIS BILL ALSO STRENGTHENS EXISTING PERCEPTIONS AROUND THE IN AGAINST A CUSTODY TO A BATTERER AND SET SOME STANDARDS. ALL AROUND ASKING COURTS TO LOOK AT THAT AGAIN TO PROTECT CHILDREN FROM BEING PLACED UNNECESSARILY WITH A BATTERER AND THERE'S SOME SOME DETAILS THAT YOU SEE YOU SEE IN THE BILL ABOUT HOW WE GO THROUGH THAT WE ASK THE COURTS TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS. SO IT'S A CHILD SAFETY BELT SOMETHING THAT IS BANNED LONG OVERDUE AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST RIGHT SANKEY WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. HI MY NAME'S NANCY LEMON I'M AN ATTORNEY I. HAVE BEEN ATTORNEY SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY AND I'VE BEEN FOCUSING ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISSUES BLANTYRE CAREER. I TEACH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LAW AT BERKELEY BOLT HALL SCHOOL OF LAW SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AND DIRECT THE PRACTICUM THERE IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. STARTING I ALSO WORKED ON FEE AMENDMENTS TO FAMILY CO THIRTY ELEVEN AND THIRTY TWENTY THAT ARE. TALKED MORE ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND I HELPED CRAFT THE LANGUAGE IN FAMILY COULD THIRTY FORTY FOUR. THE PRESUMPTION AGAINST CUSTODY TO BATTERERS ABOUT SIX YEARS AGO I CO FOUNDED THE FAMILY VIOLENCE APPELLATE PROJECT. AND WE SERVE LOW AND MODERATE INCOME PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE STATE WE DON'T CHARGE THEM ANYTHING. OUR CLIENTS ARE SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THEIR CHILDREN. IN THE SIX YEARS WE HAVE NO SCREEN OVER ONE THOUSAND. REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE. OF WE OF COURSE CAN'T TAKE THEM ALL BUT WE HAVE REPRESENTED PEOPLE IN FORTY TWO CASES SO FAR. AND TWELVE FRIEND OF THE COURT BRIEFS AND WE'VE OUR WORK HAS RESULTED IN THIRTY ONE PUBLISHED DECISIONS IN SIX YEARS. FELT REALLY INFO INFLUENCES SO AREA OF LAW AND WHAT WE'VE NOTICED. WILL BE SEEN VERY CLEARLY IS THAT THE TRIAL COURTS ARE STILL AWARDING CUSTODY EITHER JOINT CUSTODY OR SOLE CUSTODY TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE PERPETRATORS. OF ABUSE AND SO WE THINK THAT THE SECTIONS NEED TO BE CLARIFIED IN STRENGTHENED. TOM SPECIFICALLY. ONE OF THE MORE CONTROVERSIAL PARTS OF THE BILL I BELIEVE IS THAT ENTER FAMILY CUT THIRTY FORTY FOUR THE PRESUMPTION AGAINST CUSTODY THE BATTERS RIGHT NOW IF YOU ARE. A DAD WHO IS SEPARATED FROM THE MOM AND YOU HAVE THE CHILDREN IF YOU PART TIME. AND YOU ARE ABUSING YOUR CURRENT GIRLFRIEND OR SPOUSE EVEN IF YOU'RE CONVICTED OF THAT. THAT DOES NOT RAISE THE PRESUMPTION AGAINST CUSTODY. DONE AND WE THINK THAT IT NEEDS TO BE INCLUDED. SO IT'S NOT JUST THE OTHER PARENT OF THE CHILD THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT HAS THAT PERSON ABUSED THEM. FOR MOMMA THE CHILD BUT ALSO HAS THE DAD OR. COULD BE A MOM. ABUSE THEIR CURRENT PARTNER. BECAUSE THE CHILDREN SHOULD NOT BE EXPOSED TO THIS PERIOD. ANOTHER PART SETS IN THAT SECTION THIRTY FORTY FOUR IS TO CLARIFY THE FIVE YEARS. PROVISIONS SO IT WOULD SAY THAT THE FIVE YEARS. AND UNDER WHICH THE PRESUMPTION APPLIES STARTS WHEN THE COURT MAKES ITS INITIAL FINDING OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THIS IS VERY HELPFUL. BECAUSE IT'S SORT OF UNCLEAR FRANKLY IN THE CURRENT STATUTE WHEN THAT FIVE YEARS IS SUPPOSED TO START AND IT'S ALSO HELPFUL BECAUSE SOMETIMES CUSTODY LITIGATION LIKE GOLF FAMILY WHY LITIGATION. CAN TAKE A REALLY LONG TIME WE JUST HEARD ABOUT THAT EARLIER. THIS MORNING AND THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE. AND WE THINK THAT ONCE THAT PERSON HAS BEEN ABUSIVE ON. SOMETIMES THEY WILL ALSO TRY TO DRAG OUT THE QUICK PROCEEDING AND. IF THEY CAN MAKE IT LONGER THAN FIVE YEARS THEN FARE US SINCE THEY ABUSE THEIR PARTNERS THEN THE PRESUMPTION UNDER THE CURRENT LAW WOULD NOT APPLY AND WE THINK THAT IT. SHOULD APPLY STARTING WITH THE FINDING OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND FINALLY A WE WERE ALSO. IN FAVOR OF ADDING VISITATION. TO THE PRESUMPTION RIGHT NOW. THE COURTS OF CONSIDER THIS STUFF ONLY IN TERMS OF CUSTODY. BUT IT'S IF IT'S DANGEROUS FOR THE CHILDREN TO BE IN THE CUSTODY OF AN ABUSIVE PARENT. THEN IT'S ALSO DANGEROUS FOR THEM TO BE ALONE. WITH THAT PARENT WHETHER WE CALL IT CUSTODY OR VISITATION. AND ALONG THE SAME LINES MANY COURTS NOW ARE USING THE TERM PARENTING TIME. THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT CUSTODY THEY'LL TALK ABOUT VISITATION TALK ABOUT PARENTING TIME. AND SO WE THINK THAT THIS. ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE CHILDREN BEING WITH ABUSIVE PARENTS SHOULD BE APPLIED IN ANY KIND OF PARENTING TIME. AND THAT THEIR TIME WITH THE CHILDREN SHOULD BE SUPERVISED UNTIL THE COURT DECIDES OKAY. THEY HAVE. REDEEM THEMSELVES THEY'VE BEEN REHABILITATED THEY CAN NOW. HAVE UNSUPERVISED VISITATION LATER ON. THE FINAL PART THAT WE'RE VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF IS MORE TRAINING FOR JUDGES ON SPECIFICALLY THE EFFECTS ON CHILDREN. OF PEEING IN HOMES WHERE THERE'S ABUSE GOING ON IT'S VERY OF VERY BAD FOR THEIR BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND FOR THEIR EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL SAFETY. SO WE URGE HERE I FELT THANK YOU. KATHERINE CAMPBELL AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT CALIFORNIA PROTECTIVE PARENTS ASSOCIATION. OUR ASSOCIATION GOT STARTED TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN THERE WAS A CASE OF A CHILD WITH. MULTIPLE. STAND SHE ADDED REPORTS OF ABUSE THEM WHO WAS FORCED TO LIVE WITH HIS ABUSER. IN THIS CASE IT WAS THE FATHER. AND WE ARE SEEING ABUSE DISMISSED IN THE COURTS AND WE ARE NOW OF COURSE TWENTY YEARS OUT THIS YEAR FROM THE CDC AND THE KAISER PERMANENTE A STUDY. THAT SHOWS THE EFFECTS OF THE LONG TERM EFFECTS ON THE CHILD. WHEN THERE IS ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES IN THEIR LIFE AND IF YOU HAVE FOUR OR MORE OF THESE EXPERIENCES. YOU ARE TWICE AS LIKELY TO GET CANCER AND HEART DISEASE. IF YOU HAVE SIX YOU HAVE TWENTY YEARS OFF YOUR LIFE. THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE KNOW AND THE THINGS THAT WE CAN CHANGE AND WHEN WE IGNORE THE ABUSE. WE ARE SAYING THAT WE WANT. I MEAN WE ARE AT A POINT RIGHT NOW I JUST TURNED EIGHTEEN BURKE HARRIS SPEAK WHO'S. WHATEVER ACE EXPERTS I'M A PEDIATRICIAN IN SAN FRANCISCO. AND SHE HAS STATED THAT THIS IS THREE TRILLION DOLLARS THAT WE SPEND ON OUR ECONOMY IN THE U. S. PER YEAR. ON HEALTH ISSUES THAT CAN BE. THAT CAN BE LESSENED WE ARE. WE ARE IN THE. THE WAVE OF THE ME TOO MOVEMENT AND HOME IS THE LAST PLACE PEOPLE LIKE TO THINK THAT CHILDREN ARE BEING ABUSED. AND IT'S THE FIRST PLACE. THAT CHILDREN NEED TO BE SAFE. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE KEEP CHILDREN SAFE AND. AND THIS IS A GREAT STEP I'M I'M ASKING FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AS WELL AS I'M GOING TO. LET YOU KNOW THAT THE CENTER FOR JUDICIAL EXCELLENT ALSO IS ASKING FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS TEST SHE'S RUNNING LATE. BUT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT OUR CHILDREN MATTER. AND WE KNOW THE EFFECTS WE KNOW THE COST. TOO ARE SOCIETY WE KNOW THE COST TO THESE CHILDREN. AND WE KNOW THE RISK FACTORS WOULD JUST TWO FACED ACES GOES UP. TWO SUICIDE UNABLE TO FINISH HIGH SCHOOL. AND IT'S HURTING US. AS A SOCIETY AND IT'S TIME THAT WE LOOK AT ABUSE DIFFERENTLY AND MORE STRONGLY. AND WE DO ALSO RECOMMENDS THAT THERE IS TRAINING THERE NEEDS TO THESE JUDGES NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT A CHILD DOES GO THROUGH. WHEN THEY ARE WITH AN ABUSER. AND IT'S IT'S VERY. DETRIMENTAL WE'VE SEEN MANY OF THESE CHILDREN. AND AND WE WOULDN'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN TO ANYONE YET WHERE ALLOWING IT RIGHT NOW. SO WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. IN THIS BILL AND TO KEEP CHILDREN SAFE I'M MY FAVORITE WORDING HERE IS. IT IT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE SAFE AND FREE FROM ABUSE. AND I THINK THAT WE CAN ALL SIT HERE AND SAY THAT BUT WE NEED IT IN WRITING WE. LIVE IN A SOCIETY WHERE USES DISMISSED SO MUCH. DOT. WE NEED TO ACTUALLY PUT THESE BILLS TOGETHER TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO SAY YES I'M SUPPORTING THAT. SO I I DO VERY MUCH ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY. WE HAVE A MOTION FOR MISTRIAL RIGHT SECOND FROM IS GONZALEZ FLETCHER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEN NINE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING AGAIN MICHELLE BROWN A CERTIFIED FAMILY LAW SPECIALIST. I AM THE LEGISLATION DIRECTOR FOR THE ASSOCIATION OF CERTIFIED FAMILY LAW SPECIALIST I AM ALSO THE PRESIDENT OF A OF CC CALIFORNIA WHICH IS AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION COMPRISED OF LAWYERS JUDICIAL OFFICERS. AND MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND I AM ALSO THE CO CHAIR OF THE GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS COMMITTEE FOR THE NEW CALIFORNIA LAWYERS ASSOCIATION. ON BEHALF OF. AC FLS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE AMENDMENTS TO FAMILY CODE SECTIONS THIRTY ELEVEN AND THIRTY TWENTY. WHICH. STATE THAT CHILDREN DO HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE FREE FROM ABUSE AND THEY DO SUPPORT AND CLARIFY. THE ISSUES UNDER THIRTY ELEVEN WHICH GARNER'S THE HEALTH SAFETY AND WELFARE OF CHILDREN AND PROVIDES DIRECTION TO THE COURTS AS TO WHAT THINGS THE COURTS NEED TO LOOK AT. NOT ONLY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BUT WHAT I SEE MOST IN MY PRACTICE IS ACTUALLY THE ABUSE OF NARCOTICS AND CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. THIRTY ELEVEN AND THE AMENDMENTS I'M GREATLY ASSIST IN THAT AS DO THIRTY TWENTY. WE APART WE SUPPORT THE AMENDMENT TO FAMILY CODE SECTION THIRTY FORTY FOUR HALF WHICH REQUIRES THE JUDICIAL OFFICERS TO STATE IN WRITING. THE REASONS IF A PARTY HAS REBUTTED THE PRESUMPTION UNDER THIRTY FORTY FOUR. AYE BECAUSE APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY TO EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE LITIGANTS ARE SELF REPRESENTED THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT THE JUDGES NOT ONLY ORDER BUT WHY. UNFORTUNATELY WE MUST STRONGLY OPPOSE ALL OF THEIR AMENDMENTS TO THIRTY FORTY FOUR OF THE FORGET THAT I APOLOGIZE TO ALSO DO STRONGLY SUPPORT THE AMENDMENT TO THE GOVERNMENT CODE. FOR MORE TRAINING FOR JUDICIAL OFFICERS AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN FAMILY LAW WE ALWAYS SUPPORT MORE TRAINING FOR JUDICIAL OFFICERS AND FAMILY LAW. WHY DO WE OPPOSE THE AMENDMENTS TO THIRTY FORTY FOUR? WELL DOMESTIC ABUSE IS ABHORRENT. CHILDREN HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE PROTECTED. I DON'T THINK THERE IS A PERSON IN THIS WORLD WILL DISPUTE THAT. HOWEVER FAMILY CODE SECTION THIRTY FORTY FOUR DEALS WITH THE PRESUMPTIONS THAT THE COURT MUST LOOK AT. WHEN THEY HAVE MADE A FINDING THAT A PARTY HAS COMMITTED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AGAINST THE OTHER PARENT. THE CHILD OF THE RELATIONSHIP OR ANY OF THE CHILD SIBLINGS FORTY FOUR ALREADY PROVIDES THE FACTORS THAT THE COURT LOOKS AT TO DETERMINE WHETHER. THERE HAS BEEN A REBUTTAL OF THE. PRESUMPTION AGAINST JOINT. LEGAL CUSTODY OR PHYSICAL CUSTODY. THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS ARE CORRECT THAT IT DOES NOT CURRENTLY DEAL WITH VISITATION. WE HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THE EXPANSION OF THIS THIRTY FORTY FOUR. UNSUPERVISED VISITATION UNLESS THE COURT FINDS THE PARENT WITH THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FINDING HAS REBUTTED THE PRESUMPTION. BY COMPLETING THE REQUIREMENTS AND THIRTY FORTY FOUR WE BELIEVE THAT COULD. UNEXPECTEDLY. WHAT THEY CALL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF CONTACT BETWEEN A PARENT AND A CHILD AND SITUATION? DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HAS BEEN EXPANDED THE DEFINITION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THERE ARE CASES THAT I'M HAVE COME UP ON APPEAL. THAT IF YOU HAVE BEEN WRITING LOVE LETTERS TO A A PARTNER. AND YOUR WRITING IS HARASSING LOVE LETTERS THAT YOU WANT THAT PERSON BACK THAT'S GROUNDS FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER EVEN GET A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST YOU FOR THAT. SO IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE LET'S SAY THE MOM WHO'S BEEN THE PRIMARY CUSTODIAL PARENT HER HUSBAND LEAVES HER AND SHE'S DEVASTATED IS WRITING. HUNDREDS OF LETTERS PLEASE COME BACK TO ME HONEY. HE HAS THE GROUNDS TO GET A RESTRAINING ORDER AND THE COURT WILL LIKELY ORDER RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST THIS PRIMARY CUSTODIAL PARENT NOW THERE'S A PRESUMPTION AGAINST HER. HAVING NOT ONLY CUSTODY BUT ANY VISITATION IS NOT SUPERVISED WITH THE CHILD WHO MAY BE HER PRIMARY ATTACHMENT FIGURE UNLESS SHE REBUTS THESE FACTORS AND THIRTY FORTY FOUR. WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WE HAVE A STRONG PROBLEM WITH IS THE EXPANSION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TO QUOTE ANY OTHER PERSON. FOR WHOM THE PARTY HAS HAD A RELATIONSHIP AS DEFINED IN SECTION SIXTY TWO ELEVEN. OUR REASONING FOR THAT IS WE BELIEVE IT WILL OPEN UP A PANDORA'S BOX OF LITIGATION OF A TRIAL WITHIN A TRIAL. SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAD A A COUPLE WHO HAD A CHILD. AND THE HUSBAND HAD A ROCKY RELATIONSHIP WITH A PRICE YOUR PARTNER FOUR YEARS AGO IT'S WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. AND THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANY DOMESTIC ABUSE IN THIS RELATIONSHIP TO THE OTHER PARENT TO THE CHILDREN HOWEVER IN THIS SITUATION THEN THE PARENT WHO IS SEEKING SOLE CUSTODY AND SUPERVISES THE TATIAN. COULD MAKE THE MERE ALLEGATION BECAUSE THE AMENDMENTS JUST TALK ABOUT AN ALLEGATION THAT THE OTHER PARENT HAD COMMITTED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR DOMESTIC ABUSE AGAINST HIS A PARTNER FOR YEARS AGO ON A PRIOR RELATIONSHIP. THAT WOULD BRING UP THE PRESUMPTION IN THIS CASE. AND THE TERMINOLOGY ALSO SAYS THAT THERE IS JUST A MERE ALLEGATION OF DVD THE COURT MUST DETERMINE WHETHER THE THIRTY FORTY FOUR APPLIES BEFORE ISSUING ANY CUTS IN YOUR VISITATION ORDERS. THAT COULD CAUSE YOU TO HAVE A TRIAL WITHIN A TRIAL AS TO WHETHER ANY D. V. OCCURRED BETWEEN THIS PARENT AND A PRIMARY PARTNER FOR THIS PARENT COULD HAVE ANY UNSUPERVISED CONTACT WITH HIS OR HER CHILDREN. THAT GREATLY CONCERNS US WE ARE VERY THANKFUL THAT THE AUTHORS OFFICE HAS BEEN WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS ME UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE AUTHOR IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS WE WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT. HOWEVER WE ARE REQUESTING YOUR NO VOTE WITH REGARDS TO THOSE SECTIONS OF FAMILY CODE SECTION THIRTY FOUR THIRTY FORTY FOUR ON BEHALF OFA CFL LESS AND A FCC THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE AT QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE I WE DO HAVE A MOTION A SECOND IT'S TO PASS THAT I'D. MISTER AYE STONE WYCHECK CLOSE. I WOULD HAVE LET ME ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES I THINK. WE'RE DEALING WITH. SOMETHING OF THE HIGHEST ORDER IN THAT IT'S PROTECTING OUR CHILDREN AND WHERE EVER THERE'S BEEN A BATTERER. WHATEVER THEIR HISTORY. THE THE HISTORY OF THAT THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE PUT TOGETHER TO TRY AND OVERCOME. AND HELP THAT BATTERER ARE REALLY NETWORKING RECIDIVISM RATE IN THE BATTERY INTERVENTION PROGRAMS IS UP IN THE ORDERS OF OF EIGHTY PERCENT. AND SO WE DID WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A GOOD SITUATION BATTERERS TEND TO CONTINUE TO HURT. AND IF THEY HEARD THAT CHILD OR ARE BATTERING. SPOUSE OR CURRENT PARTNER EVEN IF IT'S NOT A RELATION TO THAT CHILD THAT HAS A VERY DETRIMENTAL EFFECT AND CAN BE ABUSIVE ON THAT CHILD. THIS IS WHY WE SET THE STANDARD WE'VE ALSO TRIED TO SET A STANDARD HERE. TO ENSURE THAT THE COURT IS IN FACT OVERSEEING BECAUSE IT'S A NUANCED SITUATION AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS IT'S VERY FACT SPECIFIC IT'S NOT NECESSARILY ALWAYS CLEAR WE WANT THE COURTS. TO BE OVERSEEING. THE PROCESS HERE AND MAKES OF THESE DETERMINATIONS BEFORE THEY'RE GOING TOWARD CUSTODY OR VISITATION AND IT IS JUST UNSUPERVISED VISITATION THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. IN THIS CASE BUT THAT BIG THAT'S RIGHT THAT I THINK WE HAVE THIS BILL HAS COME A LONG WAY. SINCE IT WAS ORIGINALLY PUT TOGETHER BECAUSE OF SOME THE OPPOSITIONS AND THE CONCERNS SOME THE CONCERNS. ARE. VERY REASONABLE THAT THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED AND AND WE'RE WILLING TO CONTINUE TO TALK WE HAVE ANOTHER STAKEHOLDER MEETING IN MAY. SO I THINK THIS BILL IS WORTHY OF PASSING AT THIS POINT I THINK THE BILL STANDS. FROM MY STANDPOINT STANDS ON ITS OWN NOW BUT KNOWING THAT THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS THAT WE DO NOT WANT TO UNNECESSARILY TAKE A CHILD AWAY FROM A PAIR BECAUSE THAT PARENTAL EXPOSURE IS VERY IMPORTANT. IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT CHILD BUT IT HAS TO BE IN THE SITUATION THAT IS FOR THE. BENEFIT OF THAT CHILD FOR THE HEALTH FOR THE WELL BEING AND AND THE FUTURE OF THAT CHILD SO WE'RE GONNA GET YOU TO HAVE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS. AND WORK THROUGH THIS BUT I THINK THIS BILL. IS WORTHY OF YOUR SUPPORT AND I WOULD APPRECIATE AND I VOTE THANK YOU. SO WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND AYE ESCORT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL STONE. AYE STONE AYE CUNNINGHAM CHAU. CHAU AYE CHIU. GONZALEZ FLETCHER. GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE HOLDEN. KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY. MAIENSCHEIN AYE MAIENSCHEIN AYE RESTS. REYES I. IT'S OUT I WASN'T SURE I WAS GOING TO GET THE. GAVEL BACK FROM MR MAINTAINED THAT WE DID SO ALL IS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HANDLING THAT HEARING OKAY WE DO HAVE A SPECIAL ORDER OF BUSINESS THAT IS AT ELEVEN. O'CLOCK MISTER GRAYSON HAS TWO BILLS. AND SO IF WE COULD COME BACK AT. TEN FIFTY SO ABOUT. THIRTY FIVE MINUTES FROM NOW. TAKE MISTER GRAYSON SPELL AND THEN TAKE THE SPECIAL ORDER OF BUSINESS. SO WE'RE GONNA. HAVE A RECESS UNTIL TEN FIFTY THAT IS FIVE MINUTES BEFORE ELEVEN. THANK YOU ANOTHER. YEAH I. THE NUMBER GIVEN TO CHANGE HER MIND. SO THE TIME BEING TEN FIFTEEN ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY IS WANTING TO COME BACK INTO SESSION AND DO OUR LAST. TWO BILLS WERE MISSING THE AUTHOR MR GRAYSON AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU GET THEM HERE THAT WOULD BE LOVELY OUR AUTHORS HERE SO WE WILL RECONVENE. MISTER GRAYSON. WELCOME. TO TAKE UP AB TWENTY TO FORTY. RIGHT. IT IS OUR ITEM NUMBER FOR THE TWENTY TO FORTY MISTER GRAYSON'S. BILL PLEASE. MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. GOOD MORNING AND I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT DO YOU ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY TO FORTY RELATING TO TRIAL JURY SELECTION. FOR SOMEONE LIKE TO THINK THE COMMITTEE ON THE SPONSOR. CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA FOR WORKING TOGETHER ON THIS LEGISLATION HIGH I DO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED. AB TWENTY TO FORTY WOULD EXEMPT PROBATION PAROLE AND CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. A JURY DUTY IN CRIMINAL TRIALS DESPITE HAVING SWORN PEACE OFFICERS WHO PROVIDE CRITICAL PUBLIC SAFETY SERVICES PROBATION PAROLE AND CORRECTION OFFICERS ARE NOT EXEMPT FROM SERVING ON JURY DUTY. THESE OFFICERS DUTIES INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO SUPERVISING OFFENDERS ON POST RELEASE SUPERVISION MANDATORY SUPERVISION PROBATION PAROLE AND MONITORING ADULTS AND JUVENILES SERVING TIME INSIDE A LOCAL. OR STATE DETENTION FACILITY. PULLING THESE PIECE OFFICERS FROM THEIR ASSIGNMENTS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THEIR RESPECTIVE AGENCIES ABILITY TO RESPECTIVELY MANAGE AND ADMINISTER PROGRAMS AND SUPERVISION. THESE PEACE OFFICES ARE OFTEN IN POSITIONS WHERE THE DEFENDANT IN A CRIMINAL TRIAL WHERE THEY ARE SERVING JURY DUTY. COULD POTENTIALLY ALSO BE UNDER THEIR WATCH AND JURISDICTION IN THE FUTURE. THIS CONFLICT CAN CREATE A PUBLIC SAFETY RISK TO THESE PEACE OFFICERS BY REQUIRING THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO BE SHARED DURING THE COURSE OF THE JURY SELECTION AND OR TRIAL. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND I DO HAVE. SOME. THE TESTIMONY OF SOME WITNESSES SO I WILL GIVE MY TIME OVER TO THEM TO SELF INTRODUCED. THANK YOU. FIRST WHAT GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS DANIEL SANCHEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA A PLEASED TO BE A SPONSOR ONE THAT THINK IT'S AMONG MEMBER I FOR CARRYING THE SUPPORT ISSUE. ALL THE FOR MY TIME INTRODUCE AYE CHIEF MARK PANINI WHO IS THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER AMADOR COUNTY. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AT THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TED TODAY TO TESTIFY. AND THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON. FOR ASKING ME TO SPEAK. ON THIS IMPORTANT. ISSUE IN THE NEED FOR AB TWENTY TO FORTY. AS YOU'VE HEARD WITH THE AGREED UPON AMENDMENTS TODAY AB TWENTY TO FORTY WOULD CHANGE CURRENT STATUTE TO EXEMPT PROBATION COROLLA CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. FROM JURY DUTY IN CRIMINAL MATTERS. CURRENTLY SHARES POLICE EACH PIECE SAM'S ESCOBAR POLICING UC AND CSU POLICE ARE EXEMPT. FROM CIVIL AND CRIMINAL JURY DUTY AB TWENTY TWO FORTY WAS SEVERAL SIMILARLY EXEMPT PROBATION OFFICERS FROM JURY DUTY IN CRIMINAL MATTERS. AND BRING SOME LEVEL OF PARITY WITH ADAM ARE PEACE OFFICERS AS FAR AS THE EXEMPTIONS GO. PROBATION OFFICERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CRITICAL PUBLIC SAFETY SERVICE INCLUDING SUPERVISING OFFENDERS ON POST RELEASE COMMUNITY SUPERVISION. MANDATORY SUPERVISION AND FELONY PROBATION. WE SUPERVISE OVER THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ADULT FELONS IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. WE ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR OPERATION AND PROGRAMMING IN JUVENILE HALLS CAMPS AND RANCHES. IN PROVIDING SERVICE TO YOUTH IN THE COMMUNITY INCLUDING COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY WRAPAROUND SERVICES REFERRALS TO MENTAL HEALTH. SUBSTANCE USE A DISORDER TREATMENT VOCATIONAL EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING AMONG OTHER THINGS. SERVING ABOUT THIRTY NINE THOUSAND YOUTH STATEWIDE AND YES WE DO SUPERVISE JUVENILE PAROLE AS WELL. JUVENILE PAROLEES. POINT PROBATION OFFICERS AWAY FROM OUR PEACE OFFICER DUTIES. A PROVIDING FOR THE SUPERVISION PROGRAMMING AND TREATMENT OF ADULT AND JUVENILE OFFENDERS TO SERVE ON JURIES. SIGNIFICANTLY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPEDES THAT WORK. AS AN ARM OF THE COURT PROBATION OFFICERS PREPARE REPORTS FOR THE COURT. WHICH INCLUDE RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING SENTENCING SUPERVISION ARE SUPERVISING OFFENDERS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WHICH INCLUDES ENFORCING LAWS AND SUPER ES SUPERVISION OF AND THEIR CONDITIONS AS FAR AS IF THE VIOLATE THE SUPERVISION CONDITIONS. PROBATION OFFICERS HAVE PRE EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR FELLOW CURRENT EXEMPT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. WE SERVE ON JOINT TASK FORCE. AND GENERALLY SUPPORT EACH OTHER WITHIN THE COMMUNITY COMMUNITY STRIVING FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. THE ROLE PUTS OFFICERS IN A POSITION WHERE THE DEFENDANT IS A. THE DEFENDANT IN A CRIMINAL TRIAL COULD POTENTIALLY BE UNDER THEIR JURISDICTION CREATING AN INHERENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND PUBLIC SAFETY RISK TO THE OFFICERS. EVEN THOUGH CURRENT LAW ALLOWS FOR US TO REQUEST NEXT TO REQUEST AN EXCUSE OR RESCHEDULE THAT THE REQUEST IS NOT ALWAYS GRANTED. AND RESCHEDULING MERELY JUST KICKS THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD. BASED ON WHAT I'VE LAID OUT BEFORE. ADDITIONALLY IT IS IMPERATIVE OFFICERS ARE NOT PUT IN SITUATIONS WHERE THEY HAVE TO SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION AS PART OF THE JURY SELECTION PROCESS. ESPECIALLY GIVEN OUR ROLE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM A SUPERVISING OFFENDERS AND THIS RECENTLY. THAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME M. I'M I'M THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER MY. PRESIDING JUDGE. WAS A. HAVE PRESIDING OVER A CRIMINAL MATTER AND I WALK IN THE DOOR ARABS IN OBSERVANCE OF MY JURY DUTY RESPONSIBILITY. AND I WAS CALLED INTO THE BOX I WAS. JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER JR. HAD TO DIVULGE AND MY WIFE'S. NAME AB YOU ARE ARE AT CURRENT CITY WE LIVE IN THE SCHOOLS IN MY AND KIDS ATTEND. NAM AND ULTIMATELY THIS WAS A CRIMINAL MATTER AND THE BARTENDER TO WRAP UP THE CENTER. DEFENDER ULTIMATELY. WAS IF FOUND GUILTY AND WAS PLACED ON CASELOADS THAT I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE TO SUPERVISE. SO WITH THAT I JUST WONDER AGAIN REITERATE THAT. AB TWENTY TWO FORTY. REALLY RECOGNIZES THE ROLE THAT THAT PROBATION OFFICERS BY WITHIN PUBLIC SAFETY AND I WOULD ASK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU EQUIPMENT. CHAIRMAN A GOOD MORNING MEMBERS COMMITTEE ALBERTA RECORDS ANYTHING COALITION PROVISION ORGANIZATIONS. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT OF THE ISSUE OF. IT'S BEEN RAISED BY THE AUTHOR THINKING WAS GRAYSON. AND THE CHIEFS. REGARDING THE POTENTIAL CONFLICT AND AND THE DANGER THAT THESE MEMBERS OF THE EXPRESSION OF SUPPORT AND. ISRAEL IS A REAL THING YOU KNOW I REPRESENT OF THE RANK AND FILE MEMBERS. NUMEROUS STORIES OF MEMBERS HAVING SERVED ON. CRIMINAL TRIALS INCLUDING MURDER TRIALS WHERE THEY ARE WITH THE AGAIN THERE. REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION. WE'RE NOT SURE WHO'S IN THE AUDIENCE THERE COULD BE OTHER. MEMBERS THAT THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN. PROCESS BY THE BARRAGE OFFICER THE PRICE DROPS OF REPORT MAY RESULT IN THOSE PEOPLE BEING SENT TO PRISON. THEY CERTAINLY HAVE AN AXE TO GRIND SO FOR US. THE ISSUE WAS ONE OF SIX PARAMOUNT SAFETY MAKING SURE THAT THE POLICE OFFICERS ARE REQUIRED TO DIVULGE INFORMATION. OTHER VERSIONS IS BILL WERE PASSED IN ONE OF THE ISSUES RAISED BY OPPOSITION WAS. THAT AS A MATTER OF COURSE BRITISH OFFICERS ARE TYPICALLY ALMOST ALWAYS DISMISSED FROM JURY DUTY. THAT THAT CASE. THE CHEAPEST TORTURED HIS STORY BUT OUR OPERATION OFFICERS HAVE ROUTINELY GOT TO THE BORDER PROCESS HAVE NOT EVEN BEEN SEATED ON CRIMINAL TRIAL SO. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NOVELS MENTAL. IF ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING. ANDY LEVON BOMB JUDICIAL COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA. UNFORTUNATELY WE MUST OPPOSE TWENTY TO FORTY. EVEN IS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED THE COUNCIL HAS A LONG STANDING POLICY OF OPPOSING CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS FROM JURY SERVICE. AND HAS CONTINUALLY FOUND THAT STATUTORY EXEMPTIONS. PACIFIC CATEGORIES OF PERSONS FROM JURY DUTY REDUCES THE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE JURORS. MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO SELECT REPRESENTATIVE JURIES AND UNFAIRLY INCREASES THE BURDEN OF JURY SERVICE ON OTHER SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION. FURTHER THE COURTS HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION TO ENSURE THAT JURY POOLS ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMMUNITY AND THAT THERE ENOUGH PROSPECTIVE JURORS. AT A COURTHOUSE EACH DAY TO AVOID HAVING TO DISMISS LAST DAY CRIMINAL TRIALS FOR LACK OF JURORS IN SMALL JURISDICTIONS YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE THERE ARE SO FEW PEOPLE. PULL FROM UNDER CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT RULE TO. THERE IS A HARDSHIP EXEMPTION WHEN THE PROSPECTIVE JUROR SERVICES ARE. QUOTE IMMEDIATELY NEEDED FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. COURTS WAS CONSTANTLY BALANCE THE NEED TO ENSURE ACCESS TO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM WITH THE NEED TO RESPECT JURORS TIME. HOWEVER WILL JURY SERVICE REQUIRES SACRIFICE ON THE PART OF CITIZENS. EXEMPTING CERTAIN CLASSES OF INDIVIDUALS BASED ON THE BURDEN IT MIGHT POSE ON THEM. UNFAIRLY INCREASES THE BURDEN ON OTHERS. THERE BEEN MANY CHANGES IN RECENT YEARS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO LESSEN THE BURDEN OF JURY DUTY ON CITIZEN. US CITIZENS SUCH AS ONE DAY ONE TRIAL. SO OF MANY PEOPLE CAN SHOW UP IN THE MORNING AND BE DISMISSED BY NOON. IMPROVING THE SUMMONS PROCESS TO ALLOW REQUESTS FOR EXCUSES TO BE MADE. BUT ALLOWING THE JURY POOL TO COME INTO THE COURT AND. MAKING SURE FOR EXAMPLE THAT SOMEBODY GOES TO A CIVIL TRIAL A RATHER THAN A CRIMINAL TRIAL IS EASIER THAN KEEPING TWO SEPARATE LIVES. WHO'S GETTING CALLED IN. COURTS AND. CALL IN A GENERIC POOL. AND WILL ASSIGN JURORS OUT THE BURDEN ON HAVING TO SEPARATE. THOSE WHO WOULD BE QUALIFIED FOR CIVIL TRIAL AND THOSE FOR CRIMINAL TRIAL IS A BURDEN THAT MANY COURTS CAN'T EASILY ABSORB. AND DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR SO FOR THOSE REASONS. IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THE COUNCIL WOULD CHANGE ITS POSITION GIVEN THE AMENDMENTS. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS LEXI HOWARD ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION REGRETFULLY ALSO OPPOSED TO AB TWENTY TO FORTY. AS IT WAS ANNOUNCED IT IS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED UP VERY RESPECTFUL OF PROBATION AND THE WORK THAT THEY DO WAS OUR JUSTICE PARTNERS. AND VERY RESPECTFUL OF THEIR WORKLOADS AND THE NEED FOR THEM TO BE OUT. I IN THE COMMUNITY AND DOING THEIR GOOD WORK HOWEVER FOR THE REASONS US STATED BY MISLEADING BOMB ALSO OPPOSED ALSO AWARE THAT. WHILE WE ARE CONCERNED FOR PUBLIC SAFETY REASONS OF NOT ONLY PROBATION OFFICERS AND OTHERS WHEN THEY COME TO COURT. TO A SERV POTENTIALLY FOR JURY DUTY THAT IF THEY HAVE A REASON THAT THEY THINK THEIR EXCUSE NEEDS TO BE HEARD PRIVATELY IN FRONT OF THE JUDGE. EVERY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC HAS THE RIGHT TO ASK FOR THAT AND JUDGES. GENERALLY GRANT IT A I HAVE HEARD ANECDOTAL STATEMENTS AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WHEN THIS BILL WAS LAST SUGGESTED. THAT JUDGES DON'T ALWAYS ENTERTAIN THAT BUT I'VE ACTUALLY NEVER HEARD THAT TO BE THE CASE. IF WE HEAR THAT WE CONSIDER THAT TO BE ONE OF EDUCATION AND NOT THAT NEEDS A STATUTORY PROVISION JUDGES DO FOR CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT THE JURY POOL. AND WANT PEOPLE TO FEEL SAFE COMING TO THEM AND SAY SAYING WE NEED AN EXCUSE BUT WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT THAT PUBLICLY. SO RESPECTFULLY WE ARE STILL OPPOSED TO AB TWENTY TO FORTY WE DO PLEDGED TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS THAT THERE'S SOMETHING MORE THAT WE CAN DO HERE. BUT JUDGES ALSO SERVE JURY DUTY IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF OUR DEMOCRACY AND WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT ASKING THE PUBLIC TO DO THINGS THAT. OTHERS ARE WILLING TO DO. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. AMENDMENTS MISTER GRAYSON AND THIS ISN'T AN ISSUE THAT I HAVE. ALWAYS BEEN VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT AND FACT. A LOT OF THE TESTIMONY AND IT WAS BUT I WAS FINE WITH THIS MOVING FORWARD WITH THE AMENDMENTS BUT SOME THE TESTIMONY RAISES EXACTLY THE ISSUES THAT I HAVE. AND. GOES RIGHT TO MY CONCERNS JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE ELSE HAS THE ABILITY TO GET OUT OF JURY DUTY DOESN'T MEAN ANOTHER GROUP SHOULD HAVE THAT. I DON'T BUY THAT AT ALL. AND BECAUSE YOUR JOB IMPORTANT AND I'M NOT MINIMIZING YOUR JOBS AT ALL I THINK THEY'RE CREDIBLY PORT I WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH. PROBATION SHE SAID APPROBATION DEPARTMENTS TRYING TO ENSURE THAT OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS AS RESPONSIVE AS IT POSSIBLY CAN BE AND ESPECIALLY TO THE NEEDS OF THOSE. IN YOUR CARE WHETHER IT'S JUVENILES OR ADULTS. TO GET OUT OF JURY DUTY FOR THAT REASON THERE ARE. ANY NUMBER OF CATEGORIES WHERE WE WOULD IF WE FOLLOW THAT LOGIC WE WOULD BE ACCEPTING PEOPLE FOR JURY DUTY THAT MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE. FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR DEMOCRACY FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM IS THE OBLIGATION FOR ALL OF US TO SERVE ON JURIES I'VE SERVED I'VE I'VE SHOWED UP I THINK KICKED OFF. I AS A LAW STUDENT I SERVED ON A JURY Y. I WAS LET STAY ON AS A LAW STUDENT STILLS I SCRATCH MY HEAD OVER BECAUSE THAT'S PROBABLY THE WORST OR YOU COULD. HAVE WAS ME AS A LAW STUDENT. BUT IT'S HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS AND IF WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO FIND EXCUSES TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO GET OUT OF JURY DUTY. THEN WE MINIMIZE THE POOLS WE WE STE FUNDAMENTALLY TAKE. A REAL HIT TO OUR OVERALL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND OUR OBLIGATIONS AS CITIZENS. THERE ARE MANY OCCUPATIONS THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND. THAT THAT THAT BEING THE REASON. IS REALLY BEYOND ME THE THE FACT THAT YOU ARE POTENTIALLY SUPERVISING SOMEBODY WHO'S THERE THAT YOU ARE. HAVING A RELATIONSHIP OR THAT YOU MIGHT. PUT YOURSELF THAT AT SOME POTENTIAL RISK. OKAY IN A CRIMINAL CONTEXT I SEE THAT THE REGIONAL BILL WAS FOR CIVIL. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE. AND SO THAT'S WHY IT WAS ACCEPTABLE TO. TO TAKE TO PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND AND REALLY ONLY TALK ABOUT. THE CRIMINAL SIDE OF THINGS BUT IT YOU KNOW THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD. DON'T MISTAKE THIS COMMITTEES PERSPECTIVE ON IT THAT. WE ARE GOING TO BE OPENING UP. ANYBODY THE COME FORWARD AND SAY MY JOB IS TO IMPORTANCE TO TO. WALK AWAY FROM MY FUNDAMENTAL OBLIGATION AS A CITIZEN OF THIS COUNTRY AND SERVE ON JURY ME THAT CAN'T BE WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT THAT CAN'T BE WHAT THIS DIRECTION IS ABOUT. SO I I JUST GOTTA PUT THAT ON THE RECORD. THAT WAS WHAT MOST THE TESTIMONY WAS THAT TO ME WAS PERSONALLY VERY FRUSTRATING SINCE I. THOUGHT WE WERE PRETTY CLEAR AND IN WHY WE WERE. DO ANY AMENDMENTS THAT WE DEBT SO ANYWAY THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM. COMMITTEE MEMBER. ALRIGHT SING NONE MISTER GRAYSON UN CLUB. MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PERSPECTIVE. AND. AND THE RIGHT PERSPECTIVE AS FAR AS MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T OPEN THIS UP. FOR ANYBODY THAT JUST FEELS THEY HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT DUTY OR JOB OR THE CONTRIBUTING IN A PARTICULAR WEIGHT TO SOCIETY. BUT THEY FEEL THAT. IT SHOULD EXEMPT THEM FROM THEIR DUTY. AND SO. IN ADDRESSING. THE REQUEST HERE AND THE CONTENT THAT THE MEDIA THE BILL THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT PROVIDING AND IT'S NOT AT ALL PROVIDING. A A MEANS OF CONVENIENCE FOR A PARTICULAR INDUSTRY OR A PARTICULAR GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT JUST DON'T WANNA SERVANT JURY THAT DUTY THIS IS ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY. IT'S ABOUT RECOGNIZING THAT SWORN OFFICERS SWORN PEACE OFFICERS. ARE EXEMPTED FOR A REASON. AND THAT PROBATION BASED ON SOME OF THE EFFECTS UNINTENDED AS THEY MAY BE. SOME OF THE AFFECTS OF PROP OF FORTY SEVEN. AND AB ONE OH NINE TO WHERE THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF PROBATION OFFICERS HAVE BEEN ENHANCED. THEY HAVE ALSO BECAUSE OF THE REALIGNMENT. THEY HAVE ALSO NOW BEEN PUT IN A POSITION WHERE THEY FACE EVEN MORE DANGERS. THAN THEY WERE BEFORE AN YOU HEARD THE TESTIMONY OF BEING ON THE STAND AND DELIVERING PERSONAL INFORMATION WHICH IS WHY WE WOULD EXEMPT. ADD ON ANOTHER GROUP FOR THAT SAME REASON SO I FULLY AGREE. DATA THIS SHOULD NOT BE IN THE OPEN DOOR FOR JUST ANY GROUP TO BE ABLE TO COME FORWARD BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE PRECEDENT ALREADY FOR. AND WE'RE ACTUALLY CAUSING THIS PRESIDENT TO BE ABLE TO REACH OUT AND BRING IN WITH. WITH THE TESTIMONY THAT WE'VE HAD AND WITH MUCH MUCH RESPECT. THE TESTIMONY THE OPPOSITION AS WELL AND ALSO YOUR WORKS MISTER CHAIR I RESPECTFULLY HAS FOR NIGHT VOTE TODAY. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

EIGHTY A AND RELATED LAWS AND REGULATIONS THE GUARANTEE EQUAL ACCESS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES FIRST. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS LEGISLATION AND I DO EXCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS PER THEIR ANALYSIS. MEMBERS AB THREE THOUSAND TO IS THE RESULT OF APRS OF MEETINGS WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON HOW BEST TO PROVIDE BUSINESSES WITH BETTER INFORMATION ABOUT THE EIGHTY A. AND A AND CONNECT THEM WITH THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO AID WITH COMPLIANCE. TOO OFTEN BUSINESSES ESPECIALLY SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WITH IT WELL. HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES AND THEY'RE UNAWARE OF THE IN INTRICACIES OF THESE LAWS WHEN CONSTRUCTING OR MODIFYING THE PUBLIC FACILITIES. KEY IS GETTING THE INFORMATION INTO THE HANDS OF BUSINESS OWNERS EARLY IN THEIR PLANNING PROCESS BEFORE THE SHOVEL HITS THE GROUND. THAT IS WHY OF AUTHORED THE BILL TO REQUIRE ANY LOCAL AGENCY THE ISSUES BUILDING PERMITS. FOR RENOVATION OR NEW CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS TO ATTACH AN INFORMATIONAL EIGHTY A NOTICE DIRECTLY TO THE APPLICATION FOR A BUILDING PERMIT. THESE NOTICES WILL ALSO WHEN. INCLUDE INFORMATION ON WHERE TO FIND CERTIFIED ACCESS. SPECIALIST IN THEIR AREA WHO CAN INSPECT BUILDINGS AND SITES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE STATE AND FEDERAL. A CONSTRUCTION RELATED ACCESSIBILITY STANDARDS AND FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. I DO HAVE A WITNESS IN IN THE FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. EVELYN I WILL HAVE SOME WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WE DO SUPPORT THE MEASURE IT'S IT'S. GOOD TO SEE PROACTIVE ON LEGISLATION THAT. MAINTAINS THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF PEOPLE TO PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AFTER SO MANY YEARS OF WORKING. SO HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROTECT THOSE RIGHTS I'M AND AND DEALING WITH REACTIVE MEASURES RATHER THAN PROACTIVE ONCE AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE SUPPORT THE BILL.
