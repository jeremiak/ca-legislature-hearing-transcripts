THANK YOU MEDICARE LET ME FIRST START BY THANKING CHAIRMAN HOLDEN AND HIS COMMITTEE STAFF ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH ME AND MY COALITION ON SIGNIFICAN AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL I AM ACCEPTING ALL THE MOMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS INCLUDING AMENDMENTS DISTRICT PLANNING TARGETS AND INSTEAD DIRECT THE CDC TO IDENTIFY STATE GOALS FOR LARGE SCALE AFTER A WIND IN TWENTY THIRTEEN TO TWENTY FORTY FIVE. AND MAKE IT EXPLICIT THAT OFFER A WIN SHOULD BE DEVELOPED IN A MANNER THAT PROTECTS COASTAL AND MARINE ECOSYSTEMS THIS IS A COMMITTEE THE KNOWS FULL WELL THAT THIS PAST YEAR ALONG WITH THE PANDEMIC IN THE LOSS OF OVER A MILLION JOBS IN OUR STATE CALIFORNIA HAS EXPERIENCED INTENSE CLIMATE CRISIS HEAT WAVES WILDFIRES ROLLING BLACKOUTS AND MORE. AND AS WE THINK ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS THIS CLIMATE CRISIS AND PUT PEOPLE BACK TO WORK THERE IS A ONCE IN A. GENERATION OPPORTUNITY TO DO BOTH JUST TWENTY TO THIRTY MILES OFF OUR COAST CALIFORNIA'S ACCESS TO ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST UNTAPPED RESOURCES OF RENEWABLE ENERGY OFFSHORE WIND. WIND THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE MEET CLEAN ENERGY GOALS AND PROVIDE GOOD PAYING JOBS. THE BY DEMONSTRATION HAS RECENTLY ANNOUNCED SWEEPING INVESTMENTS AND CLIMATE INFRASTRUCTURE. INCLUDING PLANNING FOR THIRTY GIGAWATTS OF OFFSHORE WIND BY TWENTY THIRTY. ALONG WITH THREE BILLION DOLLARS FOR PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE INDUSTRY. THIS PLAN ALSO EXPLORES UNLOCKING A PATH TO A HUNDRED AND TEN GIGAWATTS BY TWENTY FIFTY. AND DESIGNATE SUITABLE C. SPACE OFF THE EAST COAST. EAST COAST DATES OF SEPT TWENTY NINE GIGAWATT GOALS RESULTING IN SIXTEEN PROJECTS UNDER CONTRACT AND COUNTY. GIVEN THAT OUR CAPACITY OF A HUNDRED AND TEN GIGAWATTS IS ENOUGH TO MEET ALL OF OUR ENERGY NEEDS. WE ARE BEHIND AND WE NEED TO TAKE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO STEP UP AND ENSURE THAT WERE PART OF THIS NATIONAL PLANS. OFFER WINDOWS A SMART STRATEGY THAT COMPLEMENTS OUR SOLAR INDUSTRY BECAUSE IT GENERATES ENERGY AT NIGHT WHEN SOLAR CANNOT. OFFSHORE WIND ALSO HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ADD THOUSANDS OF GOOD PAYING JOBS IN SUPPLY CHAIN DEVELOPMENT CONSTRUCTION OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE. THIS BILL AB FIVE TWENTY FIVE WOULD JUMPSTART THE OFFSHORE WIND INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA BY CREATING A PLAN TO CONSTRUCT AND HARNESS THE POWER OF OFFSHORE WIND. IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE START PLANNING NOW TO MEET THE GOALS OF OUR STATE AND OUR COUNTRY AND WITH THAT- REALLY APPRECIATE THE STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT WE'VE HAD ON THIS BILL. ON ONE HAND THINGS OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE IN JOINT AUTHORS SIMPLY NUMBER CUNNINGHAM. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I'D LIKE TO ECHO ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOOSE- WORDS OF GRATITUDE TO THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING SO HARD ON THIS AND TO- CHAIRMAN HOLDEN FOR HIS. DEDICATION TO THE- LANDING THIS BILL IN THE RIGHT PLACE AS WE MOVE FORWARD- THE AB FIVE TWENTY FIVE IT WOULD FOR THE FIRST TIME ACTUALLY FORMALIZE CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT TO OFFSHORE WIND POWER DEVELOPMENT AND WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT WELL CALIFORNIA HAS TO DIVERSIFY OUR ENERGY PORTFOLIO TO MEET THE AMBITIOUS CLIMATE GOALS WE'VE SET FOR OURSELVES AN OFFSHORE WIND IS A VITAL COMPONENT. TO REACHING THAT GOAL. WE CAN LOOK NO FURTHER THAN ACROSS THE POND TO THE UNITED KINGDOM AS AN EXAMPLE SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS REDUCED ITS CO TWO EMISSIONS MORE THAN ANY OTHER DEVELOPED NATION IN THE WORLD. THEY'VE DONE THAT BY INVESTING IN AND BUILDING OFFSHORE WIND. AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THEIR INVESTMENT OFFICER WHEN THEY'VE SEEN THOSE CLIMATE REDUCTIONS THEIR ENERGY HAS GOTTEN CHEAPER AND THEIR ENTIRE SOCIETIES BENEFIT. CALIFORNIA'S A PERFECT PLACE. TO DEVELOP THIS NEW MARKET AN EXCITING TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE WHEN THE BLOWS TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY JUST THIRTY FORTY MILES OFF OUR COAST. THE PEAK PRODUCTION AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED AS AT NIGHT. WHEN THE PEAK DEMAND IS ON THE GRIP. THAT'S A NICE THING AND THAT'S UNLIKE SOLAR WHICH IS WHY COMPLIMENTS SO A VERY VERY VERY WELL IF WE DON'T DO THIS AND WE DON'T HAVE A PLAN WE FACE SOME PRETTY DIRE CIRCUMSTANCES COMING UP HERE IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IF YOU DON'T KNOW OUR STATE'S LAST NUCLEAR POWER PLANT DOUBLE CANYON NUCLEAR POWER PLANT WHICH IS IN MY DISTRICT IS SLATED TO BE DECOMMISSIONED GO OFFLINE WHEN THAT HAPPENS WE WILL LOSE NEARLY 10% OF OUR STATEWIDE ENERGY PRODUCTION. OVERNIGHT SO WE GOT TO START NOW AND PLANNING FOR HOW WE REPLACED THE OUTLOOK AND ITS POWER HOW WE GROW THE OFFSHORE WIND. MARKET AND HOW CALIFORNIA CAN LEAD THE WAY ON THE WEST COAST. WITH THIS EXCITING NEW TECHNOLOGY AND I SHOULD MENTION LASTLY. THIS COULD BE A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF HIGH PAYING JOBS. AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULDN'T FORGET EITHER AS WE MOVE FORWARD. I AM GLAD IN GREAT GRATEFUL TO. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHU OUR OTHER JOINT AUTHORS ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN. FOR TAKING A LEADERSHIP ROLE ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT.

COMMEND THE AUTHORS OF THIS IMPORTANT BILL YOU KNOW WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT HOW WE NEED TO HAVE A JUST TRANSITION TO GET MORE- YOU KNOW GOOD UNION LABOR BUILDING ARE RENEWABLE- UTILITY SCALE PROJECTS AND SO THIS IS. AN EMBODIMENT OF THAT EFFORT- WITH YOUR- APPROVAL THIS ISSUE I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. OUR QUE HAN YEAH IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I TO JUST WANT TO THANK- THE AUTHORED HIS JOIN AUTHOR FOR AND PRESENTING THIS BILL TODAY I THINK IT'S SO CRITICAL AS I SAID IN OUR PREVIOUS HEARING AND I KNOW MANY OF US AGREED THAT WE LOOK AT ALL THE PASSWORD TO A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE IN THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF THAT PUZZLE. BEING CALIFORNIA HAVING THIS RESOURCE ON OUR DOORSTEP AND NOT USING IT TO THE FULLEST EXTENT FEELS. LIKE NOT THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND SO I'M GLAD YOU'RE MOVING THIS FORWARD I YOU KNOW. I WISH YOU'RE DOING IT IN A MORE AGGRESSIVE WAY BUT WE ARE WHERE WE ARE AND I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT. AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I. THE THING ME UP AT NIGHT IS MY CHILDREN'S FUTURE. AND CLIMATE CHANGE AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL HAVE A WORLD THAT THEY CAN HAVE IT THAT IS SAFE. AND AGAIN THIS IS JUST A STEP% IN MAKING SURE DOING EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO ENSURE THAT FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN SAID THANK YOU MISTER CHIP. THANK YOU- MISTER. MISTER PATTERSON ARE VICE CHAIR JUST. THE OPPOSITION THAT WAS PRIMARILY- ON THE BILL- WAS BASICALLY THAT CALIFORNIA LARGE ENERGY- USERS A LOT OF AGRICULTURAL FOLKS- AND I'VE HAD- SIGNIFICANT CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM AND ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE REMOVED IT THERE- OPPOSITION THERE ARE UNDERLYING. CONCERNS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO- HAVE CONSIDERED AS AS THIS MOVES TO THE- TO THE BILL- STAGE WITH WITH RESPECT TO WHAT HAPPENS AT THE AT THE- WHAT WITH THE PLAN HERE SO- I'M GONNA LAY OFF THE BILL PRESENTLY- RESERVE MY- WHICH ON THE FLOOR- BUT DO WATER. REMIND FOLKS THAT. IT IS AGRICULTURE AND IT IS THE MARGIN OF G. USERS- THAT OFTEN HAVE- THEIR RATES INCREASED AS A RESULT OF SOME OF THE RENEWAL SO WE'VE SEEN THAT- FAIRLY REGULARLY- AND SO I THERE THERE ARE SOME STILL LATENT CONCERNS AND- FOR THAT REASON A LAYOFF PRESENTLY. THANK YOU MISTER CUNNINGHAM YEAH WITH CHAIRS INTELLIGENCE VEGAS THANK THE VICE CHAIR FOR RAISING THAT ISSUE IS ALWAYS A STRONG. PROPONENT FOR AG AND- I AM AS WELL RIGHT TRY TO BE JUST A COUPLE THOUGHTS FOR CONSIDERATION ON THAT I MEAN. THE MORE ENERGY WE CAN PRODUCE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE LESS RELIANT WE WILL BE ON IMPORTED ENERGY FROM OUT OF STATE AND WE HAVE MAJOR. GRID RESILIENCY PROBLEMS EVEN TODAY. AND THAT IS WE'RE ONLY LESS THAN FOUR YEARS AWAY FROM LOSING AGAIN. THE LAST NUCLEAR PLANT WHICH IS 10% OF THE STATE'S POWER NOW TWENTY FOUR SEVEN THREE SIXTY FIVE. SO I THINK. IN TERMS OF INCREASING SUPPLY TO MATCH SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND KEEP THE GRID RESILIENCE I THINK. THAT ANYTHING WE DO TO PRODUCE OR STORE. MORE ELECTRONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE WERE WE ARE CONTRIBUTING TO GRID RESILIENCY WHICH WILL HELP KEEP COSTS DOWN BECAUSE- AS WE'VE LEARNED AND GOING BACK. TWENTY YEARS OR SO OR MAYBE NINETEEN YEARS WHATEVER IT WAS THE LAST ENERGY CRISIS I MEAN. WE CAN END UP AS A STATE AND A VERY BAD PLACE IF WE END UP. RELYING ON OUT OF STATE IMPORTED POWER BECAUSE- WE NEED TO COVER THAT LAST 1% AND THEN WE'RE AT THE MERCY OF WHATEVER SOMEBODY FROM. A PRODUCER FROM ANOTHER STATE ONCE ONCE THE CHARGER CAN LEGALLY CHARGE AND I DON'T WANT END UP BACK THERE AGAIN SO I SEE THIS AS- ACTUALLY SUPPORTIVE OF AG. AS AN INDUSTRY WHICH HAS A LARGE CONSUMER OF ENERGY IN A LARGE PURCHASER- BECAUSE I THINK IT WILL INCREASE OVER TIME FOR ABLE TO BUILD THIS OUT TO THE SCALE- WE'RE HOPING TO. IN TERMS OF OFFSHORE WIND GENERATION IT WILL CONTRIBUTE POSITIVELY TO GRID RELIABILITY AND HOLD PRICES DOWN THE LONG RUN. AS ONE TO MAKE THAT OBSERVATION. THANK YOU SEEN ALL FURTHER COMMENT- MR SHE WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. L. PERSONALLY JUST APPRECIATE. THE COMMENTS AND ALL THE FEEDBACK TO THE PROCESS AND- WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGING WITH THE LARGE ENERGY CONSUMERS HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO DO SO I WANT TO JUST MAKE A FEW POINTS ON THAT- IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL- THE IDEA IS THAT. AS OFFER WIND IS COMMERCIALIZED WE ARE EXPECTING ENERGY COSTS TO FALL SO OUR HOPE IS. AS WE MOVE THIS FORWARD COSTS WILL BE REDUCED WE ALSO KNOW THAT. WE NEED TO ADD OFFER WIND IS PART OF A DIVERSE PORTFOLIO SO THAT WE CAN STABILIZE- THE ENERGY SOURCES THAT WE HAVE- THERE WAS AN SB ONE HUNDRED JOINT AGENCY REPORT- THAT HAD REPORTED THAT WITHOUT OFFSHORE WIND. TOTAL ENERGY COSTS BECOME A BILLION DOLLARS MORE EXPENSIVE IN THE FUTURE- BECAUSE OF REASONS WE STATED BEFORE. GIVEN THE TIME WHEN THE SENATE IS PRODUCED AT IN THE EVENING TO GET A COMPLIMENTS WHAT'S HAPPENING SILVA. LET ME ALSO JUST AND BY ECHOING THE COMMENTS OF OUR EAST BAY COLLEAGUE- LIKE HER AND LIKE MANY OF YOU. I HAVE A YOUNG CHILD AND WE KNOW AT THIS MOMENT WE HAVE TO ACT NOW WHEN IT COMES TO THIS CRISIS AND I REALLY WANT TO THANK- THE SIGNIFICANT COALITION OF ENVIRONMENTALISTS. THE CLEAN ENERGY INDUSTRY AS WELL AS LABOR FOR COMING TOGETHER. TO MOVE FORWARD THIS VISION NOT JUST FOR OFFER WIN BUT WHAT A JUST TRANSITION MEANS. HI THIS IS GOING TO BE INSTRUMENTAL FOR US TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CRISIS. AND ALSO CREATE THE JOBS THAT WE NEED TO FOR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY ECONOMY THAT WE WANT TO CALIFORNIA. AND WITH THAT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU SIX PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. I AND NUMBER TWO EIGHTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED AS AMENDED TO NATURAL RESOURCES.

ENERGY CALIFORNIA ALTERNATE RATES FOR ENERGY PROGRAM NET ENERGY METERING ELECTRICAL CORPORATION DISTRIBUTED ELIGIBLE RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCE ALLOCATION INTERCONNECTIONS MISS GONZALEZ YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU- MADAM CHAIR AT FIRST I WANT TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS OR THE REWRITE OF MY BILL- AS DESCRIBED IN THE NOW SAYS AND THINK THE CHAIRED COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR VERY HARD WORK ON THIS BILL. AB ELEVEN THIRTY NINE THE FULLER EQUITY IN REGULAR PAYER RELIEF ACT WOULD PHASE OUT CALIFORNIA'S INEQUITABLE ENERGY RATE STRUCTURES IF THE CPUC FAILS TO ADOPT NM THREE BY NEXT YEAR AND MAKE OTHER MUCH NEEDED CHANGES PER CUSTOMER GENERATORS. CALIFORNIA FIRST INTRODUCED NETWORK ENERGY METERING TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCENTIVIZE THE ADOPTION OF REACH TOP SOLAR WHICH AT THE TIME WAS A PLEDGING INDUSTRY. UNDER NAM CUSTOMERS NOT ONLY HAVE LOWER BILLS BECAUSE THEY'RE USING LESS ENERGY FROM THE GRID BUT ALSO FROM THE CREDITS THEY RECEIVE FOR SELLING BACK THEIR ACCESS POWER THE RETAIL RATES TO UTILITY. I KNOW THIS FIRSTHAND BECAUSE I ALSO IN ME ROOFTOP SOLAR CUSTOMER HOWEVER STUDIES DONE BY THE C. U. P. HAVE FOUND THAT THEY ACROSS THE STATE ROOFTOP SOLAR CUSTOMERS ARE CONSISTENTLY BENEFITING FROM THE RATE STRUCTURE MORE THAN THE VALUE OF THE ENERGY GENERATION SOLAR CUSTOMERS ARE ABLE TO AVOID PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. OF FIXED COSTS TO THE GREAT BY AVOIDING ENERGY USAGE CHARGES DESPITE ALL OF US INCLUDING SOLAR CUSTOMER STILL RELYING ON GRID INFRASTRUCTURE THOSE COSTS ARE THEN SHIFTED TO OTHER RATEPAYERS IN A RULE MAKING PROCEDURE BEFORE THE CPUC THE STATEWIDE KASHIF WITH ESTIMATED ROUGHLY THREE BILLION DOLLARS AND EXPECTED TO GROW TO FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS BY TWENTY THIRTY. A RECENT STUDY BY UC BERKELEY IN TOUGH FOUND THAT EVEN AFTER CONTROLLING FOR INCOME AND HOME OWNERSHIP BLACK AND LATINO NEIGHBORHOODS HAD LESS ROOFTOP SOLAR INSTALLED IN WHITE MAJORITY NEIGHBORHOODS LEADING THEM TO BE DISPROPORTIONATELY BEAR THE BURDEN OF THIS COST SHIFT. AB ELEVEN THIRTY NINE IS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED WOULD REFORM THE KASHIF AND REQUIRE CUSTOMER GENERATORS TO BE CREDITED FOR ENERGY EXPORTS AT WHOLESALE MARKET RATES THE SAME AS ANY OTHER GENERATOR N. B. CHARGE FIXED FEES TO COVER THE NON GENERATION COSTS OF SERVING THE CUSTOMER. THIS SUCCESSOR CHERUB. WOULD GO INTO EFFECT DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY WHEN THREE ALL. IF THE C. P. HAS FAILED DOCTORS. TO PROVIDE AMPLE UPPER TO ALLOW THE C. P. TO ACT. THE AMENDMENTS WHICH EXIT NUMBER. TO THE SIX CARE OF. NO LATER THAN FIVE YEARS AFTER IN. OR TEN YEARS FOR CARE CUSTOMERS. THE AMENDMENTS WOULD ALSO REQUIRE. WAGE FOR INSTALLING NEW RENO ENERGY FOR. AFTER THIRD FIRST TWO TWENTY. IN REQUIRE THE C. P. U. C. H. INCLUDING. ON THE GROWTH OF RESIDENTIAL ROOFTOP SOLAR AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THEIR ANNUAL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE. BY CHARGING SOLAR CUSTOMERS THEIR FAIR SHARE AB ELEVEN THIRTY NINE WOULD GREATLY REDUCED RATES FOR NON THEM CUSTOMERS WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO PUSH COSTS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SERVES EVERYONE. ONTO NON SOLAR CUSTOMERS FURTHER EXASPERATING ANY INEQUITIES IN THE STATE BOTH FINANCIALLY AND IN ACCESS TO RENEWABLE ENERGY. AB ELEVEN THIRTY NINE WOULD PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED REFORM I HAVE I HAD TO WITNESSES ON THE PHONES I BELIEVE. SCOTT WHICH EMERGES THAT. WHO MADAM CHAIR MEMBER SCOTT WHICH ON BEHALF OF THE STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS. AB ELEVEN THIRTY NINE IS ABOUT CORRECTING GROSS INJUSTICES. 91% OF ALL YOUR RATE PAYERS ARE SUBSIDIZING THE OF MORE THAN THREE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. AT LEAST ONE THIRD OF THAT WINDFALL DOESN'T EVEN GO TO RATEPAYERS AT ALL HE GOES TO BIG CORPORATIONS LIKE TESLA AND SUNRUN. WELL COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND. YOU ALL THE SEEN THE UC BERKELEY STUDY ON THE RACIAL INEQUALITY OF OUR SOLAR PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE IN RANCHO SANTA FE ONE OF THE STATE'S WEALTHIEST COMMUNITIES. THEM WELL IN THE FIVE POOREST ZIP CODES AND CA DIEGO IT'S A LITTLE MORE THAN 1% THE CALIFORNIA SOLAR INITIATIVE PROGRAM SPENT THREE BILLION DOLLARS SUBSIDIZING ROOFTOP SOLAR AND LESS THAN 2% WENT TO LOW INCOME AFFORDABLE OR MULTI FAMILY HOUSING. WELL 98% WENT TO WEALTHY COMMUNITIES AND BIG CORPORATIONS. IN ADDITION TO THIS ABSURD WINDFALL THE 91% OF RATE PAYERS ARE BURDENED WITH PAYING ALL THE SYSTEM COSTS THAT THE 9% AVOID. ITS REVERSE ROBIN HOOD. MAKE NO MISTAKE AS YOUR ANALYSIS CORRECTLY POINTS OUT THIS IS ABOUT LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY BEING RESPECTED EIGHT YEARS AGO THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED AB THREE TWENTY SEVEN. DIRECTING THE CPUC TO FIX THIS COST SHIFT AND THEY HAVE FAILED TO COMPLY AB ELEVEN THIRTY NINE HOLDS THE COMMISSION'S FEET TO THE FIRE FINALLY. THIS BILL APPLIES PREVAILING WAGE TO THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS SOLAR INSTALLERS MAKE BETWEEN ELEVEN DOLLARS AND FIVE CENTS AND TWENTY BUCKS AN HOUR WITH LITTLE TO NO BENEFITS. THIS IS NOT LIVABLE. DON'T BE SWAYED BY WEALTHY CELEBRITIES PAGE SPOKESPEOPLE FOR SUN RUN AND ARE NOT LICENSED CONTRACTORS IN CALIFORNIA. IF YOU'RE SINCERE ABOUT CREATING GOOD GREEN JOBS PLEASE VOTE FOR AB ELEVEN THIRTY NINE. THANK YOU NEXT ART WE HAVE MARKET ALSO WITH ADAMS BROADWELL JOSEPH AND CARDOSO YOU MAY PROCEED WITH YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. WITH THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THIS BILL WOULD GIVE THE COMMISSION A DEADLINE TO MAKE A LONG OVER DUE COURSE CORRECTION IN A ROOFTOP SOLAR PROGRAM. CURRENTLY REPAIRS WITHOUT SOLAR PAY RATE PAYERS WITH SOLAR AT THE FULL RETAIL RATE. IS THE COMMITTEE MET ANALYSIS DOCUMENTS ON PAGE THREE. IN TWENTY TWENTY ALONE NET ENERGY METERING IS SHIFTING COSTS TO THOSE WITHOUT. TO THE TUNE OF MORE THAN THREE BILLION DOLLARS AND GROWING. THIS IS NOT SUSTAINABLE. THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WOULD ADDRESS THE CURRENT KASHIF BY WINNING EXISTING THEM CUSTOMERS OFF THE CURRENT RATE. OR THAT MORE THAN ONE THIRD THE CURRENT CUSTOMERS ARE SOLD TO COMPANIES THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY LEASE THE ROOF AND RETAIN OWNERSHIP OF THE SYSTEM. FOR CARE CUSTOMERS MORE THAN HALF ARE OWNED BY THE COMPANIES. THEY JUST PASS ON A SMALL SAVINGS TO THE RESIDENT. THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ALSO REQUIRE THE FUTURE NAME SYSTEMS BECAUSE SCRIPTED USING THE PREVAILING WAGE THIS IS TOTALLY JUSTIFIED. THE LARGE SCALE SYSTEMS THAT SUPPLY UTILITIES AND CCA'S ARE ALMOST ALL BUILT WITH PREVAILING WAGE AND THEY ONLY COST THREE CENTS A KILOWATT HOUR SO THERE'S NO QUESTION. ABOUT THE COST TO PREVAILING WAGE. AND ALSO WE CAN'T FORGET THAT THE BIGGEST SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS S. TRANSPORTATION. WE NEED ALECTRA CITY TO BE THE FUEL OF CHOICE TO REDUCE TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS. BUT NET ENERGY METERING IS DRIVING UP RATES SO MUCH THAT WE DON'T DO SOMETHING ELECTRICITY WILL COST MORE THAN GASOLINE AND DIESEL INSTEAD OF LESS. FINALLY THE BILL AS AMENDED BY THE COMMITTEE WILL NOT KILL THE SOLAR INDUSTRY. REMINDER COMMITTEE WHICH YOU ALL KNOW WHICH IS THAT THE ENERGY COMMISSION HAS REQUIRED SOLAR ON NEW CONSTRUCTION. SO THEY'LL BE PLENTY OF ROOFTOP SOLAR IN THE FUTURE IT JUST WON'T COME AT THE EXPENSE OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE ROOFTOP SOLAR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE HAVE TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TESTIFYING BY PHONE. PHONE MODERATOR WE HAVE TROY CARROLL. YOU MAY PROCEED WITH YOUR TESTIMONY. JERRY GARCIA BY FIVE SHARE PATTERSON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY MY NAME IS FOR CAROL AND I LIVE IN BAKERSFIELD AND I URGE YOU TO OPPOSE AB ELEVEN THIRTY NINE. I'M A KERN COUNTY LOCAL WERE GROWING UP THERE WERE TWO MAJOR JOB OPPORTUNITIES FARMING AND OIL. I CHOSE ALL. IF YEARS AGO FACING THE UPS AND DOWNS OF OIL BUSINESS AND CONSTANT TRAVEL I WAS LOOKING FOR MORE STEADY A PROMISING WORK TO SUPPORT MY FOUR KIDS AND KEEP A CLOSE TO HOME. I FOUND THAT JOBS IN THE ROOFTOP SOLAR INDUSTRY THIS IS THE FUTURE. BUT AT ELEVEN THIRTY NINE THREATENS MY JOB AND THE JOB OF HIM BUT THOUSANDS OF OTHER SOLAR WORKERS LIKE ME. I'M NOT ALONE IN MY STORY. HALF OF MY CO WORKERS TRANSITION FROM OIL TO SOLAR. WHICH IS TESTAMENT TO HOW LARGE A CENTRAL VALLEY SOLAR MARKET IS. BAKERSFIELD IN FACT IS THIRD IN THE STATE FOR ROOFTOP SOLAR INSTALLING ALMOST AS MUCH OF LOS ANGELES AND SAN DIEGO. THIS IS A GOOD THING. A LOT OF POLITICIANS FROM JOE BIDEN THE GOVERNOR NEWSOM WONDER HOW WE ARE GOING TO TRANSITION FROM FOSSIL FUELS. TO CLEAN ENERGY JOBS. WELL IN BAKERSFIELD. THAT TRANSITION IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING. THAT IS UNLESS AB ELEVEN THIRTY NINE PASSES. NOW I WANT TO BE CLEAR I AM NOT AGAINST OIL JOBS I AM FOR SOLAR JOBS I THINK WE NEED TO TRANSITION TO CLEAN ENERGY. BUT THE TRANSITION NEEDS TO BE STATIC IT NEEDS TO BE REAL AND IT NEEDS TO BE FELT THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE CAN'T HAVE OUR CALIFORNIA'S BALL FOR ROOFTOP SOLAR ONE DAY AND THEN THE NEXT DAY IF NOT. CALIFORNIA CAN'T BE PERSONAL WORK IN LIMITED SITUATIONS FOR NARROW SET OF CONSUMERS. EIGHTY ELEVEN THIRTY NINE O'CLOCK CALIFORNIA TO GO FROM BUILDING ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND SOLAR ROOFS A YEAR. TO LESS THAN TWENTY THOUSAND. THIS WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH TO SUPPORT MY JOB I'M NOT SURE. WHAT CALIFORNIA HAS DONE THROUGH NET METERING DISCRETE CONSISTENT RULES FOR CONSUMERS BUSINESSES AND WORKERS TO PLAN AROUND THESE CONSISTENT RULES CAN BE CHANGED. BUT THE CHANGES NEED TO BE SLOW AND GRADUAL SO THERE IS TIME TO ADJUST TO GROW INTO THEM. AND THEY CAN'T BE RETROACTIVE. I THINK THAT IS WHAT BOTHERS ME THE MOST ABOUT EIGHTY ELEVEN THIRTY NINE. IT WOULD HAVE CALIFORNIA GO BACK ON HIS WORD TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE MADE THE INVESTMENT IN CLEAN ENERGY. AND YOU JUST CAN'T DO THAT. THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE IT AROUND THE PURPORTED COST SHIFT. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN KERN COUNTY BECAUSE CONSULAR. ARE NOT WEALTHY. THEY INVESTED IN SOLAR BECAUSE IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND BECAUSE THEY ARE FED UP WITH P. GENIES PROBLEMS. THE WILDFIRES. COMMENTS BANKRUPTCIES. THE HIGH ENERGY BILLS THEY WANT CHOICES THEY WANT SOLUTIONS. THAT PG&amp;E IS TRYING TO BLAMES COLOR USERS FOR THEIR PROBLEMS THAT THEY HAVE CREATED WILL BE LAUGHABLE IF IT WASN'T SO DEADLOCKED. IN CLOSING I WOULD LIKE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT BRAD HEAVEN OR THE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA SOLAR AND STORAGE ASSOCIATION IS ALSO ON THE LINE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. PLEASE DO NOT KILL MYSELF A JOB. PLEASE VOTE NO ON AT ELEVEN THIRTY NINE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE HAVE JONATHAN SCOTT WITH SCOTT BROTHERS GLOBAL. MODERATOR THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU SERVICIOS VICE CHAIR PATTERSON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT YOU SPEAKING TO ME I- BY JONATHAN SCOTT I LIVE IN LOS ANGELES AND I JUST WANNA SAY RIGHT OFF THE TOP I OPPOSE AB ELEVEN THIRTY NINE ELECTED THE POTENTIALLY AMENDED I'LL TELL YOU WHY I HAVE A VERY UNIQUE BACKGROUND IN THE HOME AND ENERGY SPACE THAT SEPARATE THAT FROM RENOVATING OVER FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY HOMES ARE SHOW PROPERTY BROTHERS I HELP THOSE FAMILIES BUT ALSO IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS OF MY LIFE TRAVELING ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOR MY DOCUMENTARY POWER TRIP. THAT EXAMINE THE WAR BETWEEN FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY AND RENEWABLE ENERGY COMPANY AND I INTERVIEWED HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE FROM VARIOUS STATE EVERY WALK OF LIFE YOU CAN IMAGINE AND PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO CHOOSE WHETHER OR NOT TO PAY THEIR POWER BILLS FOR TO PAY FOR FOOD ON THE TABLE FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND THAT IS CRAZY. THAT THAT'S HAPPENING IN AMERICA AND THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT REALLY STOOD OUT TO ME ON A JOURNEY ONE IS THAT IN ENERGY IS BEING MADE INTENTIONALLY COMPLICATED WHEN IT DOES NOT NEED TO BE THERE ARE SOLUTIONS THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR UTILITIES AND THEIR WORKERS AND THAT A VERY IMPORTANT THING IN CREATING NEW JOBS BUT ALSO PROTECTING THE JOB THAT WE ALREADY HAVE- BUT AT ALL QUICK TO BE GOOD FOR THE INDIVIDUAL ESPECIALLY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND THE SECOND BIG THING THAT I DISCOVERED IS THAT THE REST OF THE COUNTRY LOOKED UP TO CALIFORNIA WHEN IT COMES TO RENEWABLE ENERGY. IT WAS AMAZING TO ME THAT THEY SAW CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER AND WHEN I MOVED TO CALIFORNIA I WAS PROUD TO BE A PART OF A STATE THAT HAD THAT KIND OF FORWARD THINKING I LIVED IN NEVADA AND I LIVED THROUGH THE NET METERING DISASTER IN THE NEVADA AND ONE OF THE VENGEFULLY OVERTURNED NEVER IN MY LIFE HAVE I SEEN A CATASTROPHIC RESPONSE TO APPEASE THE BAD LEGISLATION LIKE THAT THE PUBLIC OUTCRY WAS INCREDIBLE EVERYBODY FULLER CUSTOMERS AND NON CORE CUSTOMERS WERE UPSET BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THE IMPACT OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING. AND I THINK IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE GOING DOWN THE SAME PATH EXCEPT THE RESULT WILL BE EVEN WORSE BECAUSE PEOPLE EXPECTING CALIFORNIA THAT WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW POLICY THAT SUPPORT CLEAN AFFORDABLE ENERGY ACCESS. FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS- COMMITTEE CRICKET BUILD LUMPING TO. THAT THINGS THAT SHOULD NOT BE DEALT WITH TOGETHER. THERE IS AN ECHO ISSUE IN. BUT THIS IS NOT HOW SOLVE IT. AND WE WOULD ASK YOU SEE A NET JOB LOSS IN THE STATE. IF WE WENT WITH THE BILL THE IT'S WRITTEN. AND FRANKLY NOT ME DOES NEED ENOUGH. BUT OTHER THREAT IT WOULD ACTUALLY EXACERBATE THE ISSUE. AND EFFECTIVELY CANCEL OUT ANY. SAVINGS FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IF YOU WANT ROOF TOP. THE OTHER. THAT IT'S BEEN TWO MINUTES HE PLEASE READ UP. YES I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT WE WOULD NOT BE A LEADER WE GROUP WE GO THIS PATH WE WOULD FALL TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PACK AND YOU KNOW AB ELEVEN THIRTY NINE IS TALKING SOME OF THE RIGHT. THING THAT I DO AGREE WITH A LOT OF HARD WORK BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO REALLY THINK CAREFULLY BECAUSE THIS WOULD CREATE A LARGER IMBALANCE AND WE'RE EVEN SEEING NOW SO I'D SAY PLEASE VOTE NO.

MISS BURKE- FIRST I WANT TO START BY AT LEAST A POINT ACKNOWLEDGING AND APPRECIATING THAT THE OPPOSITION ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE INEQUITIES IN THE SYSTEM AND IN THE PROGRAM I THINK THAT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT I DO WANT TO STAY IN NO WAY DOES THIS BILL KILL THE SOLAR INDUSTRY. AND IF THE ONLY WAY THE SOLAR INDUSTRY CAN EXIST IS ON THE BACK OF LOW INCOME COMMUTERS I WOULD CERTAINLY HOPE THAT THE OPPOSITION THAT HAVE CALLED IN WOULD BE CALLING IN WITH A MUCH DIFFERENT ATTITUDE. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR I KNOW THAT CHALLENGING RACIAL AND ECONOMIC INEQUITIES. IN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY IS REALLY HARD AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING ON THAT CHALLENGE- YOU KNOW REBELLING. EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PROGRAMS IS LONG OVERDUE AND THE ISSUE OF COST SHIFTING IS AN IMPORTANT ONE AND I'M A BELIEVER THAT. EQUITY ON ALL LEVELS OF OUR AND FIRE BERMAN A POLICY IS VITAL FOR ALL COMMUNITIES TO TRULY PARTICIPATE AT. TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE- I HAVE LEGISLATION THAT CALLED ATTENTION AND TRY TO MAKE RIGHT FROM IN EQUITIES IN THE COMMUNITY AND MY DISTRICT IN THE DISTRICT OF THE AUTHOR FACES AS WELL BECAUSE FAR TOO OFTEN. THEY ARE AN AFTERTHOUGHT IF THOUGHT OF AT ALL. SO I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS BILL AND- I WILL BE VOTING I THINK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER KING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF I AM A PROUD- SORT HAD BEEN THE SOLE SUPPORTER FOR YEARS AND YEARS BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR WORKING ON THIS ISSUE I THINK IT IS TIME THAT WE TAKE A LOOK AT HOW WE PAY FOR THE OVERALL SYSTEM- HOW THOSE COSTS ARE DIVIDED I THINK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PIECES OF THEBILL THAT I PROBABLY SUPPORT ESPECIALLY. ON THE ON PREVAILING WAGE PART OF THE BILL I DID HAVE SOME CONCERNS I KNOW THAT MY OF MY OFFICE TO CALL YOUR OFFICE ABOUT WAS. THE AMOUNT OF TIME- FERDINAND CUSTOMERS AFTER THEY WERE INSTALLED TO. RECOUP SOME OF THEIR COST I KNOW THAT I WAS AN EARLY ADOPTER. OF SOLAR AND REALLY DID RELY ON THEM TO. HELP RECOUP THAT SOMEONE. YOU ARE THE AUTHOR WOULD CONSIDER GOING FROM FIVE YEARS TO TEN YEARS THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I WOULD BE. DISTANCING ALSO KNOW THAT- IN A VERY LATE VERSION OF THE BILL. THERE WAS A THERE WAS LANGUAGE THAT WAS STRUCK. YEAH I KNOW THE INDUSTRY AT THE STORE SHE'S VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. THAT STRUCK THE PART THAT SAYS CUSTOMER SIDE TO RENEWABLE ENERGY MUST GROW SUSTAINABLY. AND I'M HOPING THAT THE AUTHOR COULD WORK- WHAT THE SOLAR INDUSTRY TO REALLY FIVE- LANGUAGE THAT WOULD BE MORE ACCEPTED ONE OF THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY REALLY- FIELD IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM. AND I THINK IF YOU WERE WILLING TO WORK ON THOSE TWO PROVISIONS I THINK THIS IS A BILL THAT I COULD. SUPPORT TO GET OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY- WITH- THE IDEA THAT I HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK ON THE FLOOR TO SEE WHAT IT WOULD. LOOK LIKE WITHOUT THE FOR. AND I AM HOPEFUL ARE ARE I. DID YOU BACK TO YOU. WILL WORK ON BOTH OF THOSE THINGS I HAVE THAT. NO REAL CONCERNS EXTENDING IT TO TEN YEARS FOR BOTH KAREN ON HERE- AT CUSTOMERS I DO UNDERSTAND I'M ALSO SOLAR AT. CUSTOMER IN FACT MY CONTRACTOR CALLED TWICE IT SOUNDED LIKE- ID ARE UTILIZED IBEW WORKERS FOR ROOFTOP SOLAR. THERE'S ONE COMPANY AND THEY AT. IN SAN DIEGO AND I DID DO EXTENSIVE RESEARCH ON HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE BACK WE WILL GET OUR MONEY BACK EVEN USING. UNION INSTALLERS BUT BEFORE THE TEN YEARS AND SO I JUST I APPRECIATE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BUT THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REALLY START PUSHING. THANK YOU. THIS CARILLO. COULD CAN HEAR MY FOR GO I'M I HAVE A QUESTION I WONDER IF MR JONATHAN SCOTT IS STILL THE INITIAL WITNESS IS STILL ON THE LINE. MODERATOR. THIS IS KIND OF A LEVEL. WHENEVER WE LOOKING FOR I DID CATCH IT. WE'RE LOOKING FOR MISTER JONATHAN SCOTT ONE OF THE ORIGINAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WHAT IF YOU DEVELOP A ONE MOMENT PLEASE. YOUR STRATEGY TO ON THE CALL PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO OPEN UP YOUR LINE. I DON'T WANT TO CALL ANYMORE. THANK YOU FOR THAT- IF FOR THOSE OF HIS I GET THE GROUP THAT HE'S CALLING ON BEHALF FROM I'M JUST CURIOUS IF HE'S A PAID SPOKESPERSON FOR SON RUNS FOR SON RAN SUN RUN AND IF HE'S ALSO A LICENSED CONTRACTOR IN CALIFORNIA CONSIDERING HIS COMMENTS ON OUR STATE. LET ME CONTINUE ON WITH MY COMMENTS I- I WROTE AN ORIGINAL BILL- RELATED TO NET ENERGY MEETING LAST YEAR WHICH WE HELD ECAUSE OF COLD IT AND HAVE BEEN JUST COMPLETELY STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT THIS AT THE NET ENERGY METERING HAS NOT BEEN RESTRUCTURED. UP FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW GIVEN THAT THE CALIFORNIA PC HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO AND HAS NOT DONE SO- THIS BILL DOES NOT KILL SOLAR ENERGY THAT'S A COMPLETE FALSEHOOD- AND I WOULD SAY THAT NOW MORE THAN EVER POLICYMAKERS AND REGULATORS ALIKE HAVE AN OBLIGATION. TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE PURSUING OUR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS AND TRANSITIONING 21100% CLEAN ENERGY IN A MATTER THAT ACHIEVES A MAXIMUM BENEFIT OF THE LEASE AND THE LEASE POSSIBLE COSTS FOR CUSTOMERS THE CURRENT STRUCTURE FOR NAM FAILS TO ACHIEVE THAT OBJECTIVE BECAUSE IT MANDATES THAT UTILITIES PURCHASE EXCESS POWER GENERATED FROM ROOFTOP SYSTEMS THAT ARE. AT A RATE ROUGHLY FIVE TIMES HIGHER THAN A CAN BE PURCHASED ANOTHER SOURCES EVERYBODY BENEFITS FROM OF THE ENERGY GRID AND EVERYBODY SHOULD PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE AND THAT'S NOT CURRENTLY THE REALITY AND THAT'S NOT THE REALITY OF EQUITY IN ENERGY A STRONG RELIABLE ELECTRICAL GRID IS CRITICAL TO ALL ELECTRICITY CUSTOMERS ALSO HAVE. SOLAR AT HOME AND THOSE WHO DON'T AND HOWEVER THE CURRENT AD TERRIBLE L. SOLAR CUSTOMERS TO BY PASS THESE MAINTENANCE COSTS IN ADDITION TO A PORTION OF PUBLIC PURPOSES PROGRAMS COST NAM TERRORISTS SHOULD NOT BE REGRESSIVE AND EXCESSIVE IN COMPARISON TO OTHER POLICY MANDATES THE MAGNITUDE OF THE ANNUAL NAMM KASHIF NOW EXCEEDS THAT OF THE CALIFORNIA ALTERNATIVE RATE FOR ELECTRICITY WHICH IS THE CARE PROGRAM. WHICH IS A SUBSIDY AT ABOUT A COST OF ONE BILLION AND IT HELPS. TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION VULNERABLE OWING SOME CUSTOMERS OF THE STATE. MEANWHILE JUST ABOUT NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND CUSTOMERS RECEIVE SUBSIDIES FOR THEIR SOLAR SYSTEMS AND YET ARE RESPONSIBLE. FOR RAISING THE ENERGY RATES TO LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME CALIFORNIANS AT A COST OF ABOUT TWO BILLION ANNUALLY. THIS IS NOT A FORMULA BASED ON EQUITY NOR SHOULD IT BE A FORMULA AS PRAISED AS THE ANSWER TO THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE. ALL CALIFORNIANS SHOULD CONTRIBUTE EQUITABLY TOWARDS THE STATE'S CLEAN ENERGY GOALS AND CERTAINLY OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. SHOULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO CARRY THE LOAD FOR THOSE. WITH HIGHER INCOMES CLEAN ENERGY INVESTMENTS TO MEET CALIFORNIA'S 1100% CLEAN POWER GOAL SHOULD BE BALANCED. CUSTOMER CHOICES AND THAT THEY SHOULD BE EQUITABLE. I STRONGLY SUPPORT OUR STATE CLEAN ENERGY GOALS AND CUSTOMERS CONTINUED ABILITY TO CHOOSE TO INSTALL SOLAR HOWEVER. NOT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE THE OPTION OF GENERATING OR STORING THEIR OWN CLEAN POWER. A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT WHO OWNS THEIR HOME. AND HAS THE LUXURY OF INSTALLING SOLAR SHOULD NOT BE SUBSIDIZED BY A RENTER WHO DOESN'T OWN THE ROOF OF THEIR HOME. AND HAS TO MAKE UP FOR THE COST. OF OUR MUCH NEEDED ENERGY GRID. THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSIONS HAD AND HAS SQUANDERED THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES AND ADJUSTING. NET ENERGY METERING ON THE BACKS OF WORKING CLASS CALIFORNIANS AND THEIR LACK OF ACTION HAS CREATED A FALSE NARRATIVE. WHICH WE HEARD THROUGHOUT THE TESTIMONY. AND THE WITNESSES CALLING IN. SO THE CHOICE OF ONE CUSTOMER TO INSTALL ROOFTOP SOLAR SHOULD NOT CONTINUE. TO RESULT IN AN INCREASE OF THE ELECTRICAL BILLS TO CUSTOMERS WHO DON'T HAVE THIS CHOICE. FOR THOSE. THAT BELIEVE IN. THE PILLARS OF THE GREEN NEW DEAL THOSE PILLARS INCLUDE A JUST TRANSITION OF WORKERS. IT INCLUDES CALLING OUT FOR GOOD QUALITY WELL PAID SECURE JOBS GOOD UNION JOBS. FOCUSING ON AREAS IN COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE ARE NEEDED. THE MOST IT SEEKS TO DRAW ON THE SKILLS AND POTENTIAL OF PEOPLE TO TRANSFORM THE WAY THAT WE- TRAVEL THE WAY THAT WE CREATE ENERGY. THE WAY THAT WE PRODUCE AND CONSUME ENERGY AND THE WAY THAT WE MANAGE THE LAND THE WAY WE GROW FOOD HOW WE EAT AND HOW WE WORK WE ARE IN AN INTERESTING TIME IN THE WE KEEP TALKING. ABOUT IT JUST TRANSITION AND DOING VERY LITTLE TO ACTUALLY HELP WORKERS ACHIEVE THAT. ADJUSTING THE NET ENERGY METERING TO TODAY'S REALITIES AND COSTS IS ESSENTIAL. IN CALIFORNIA ACHIEVING CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS AND ULTIMATELY A DIVERSE ENERGY PORTFOLIO WHICH WE- VERY MUCH NEED I AM PROUD TO BE A JOINT AUTHORS ON THIS BILL. I AM HAPPY TO CONTINUE HAVING THE CONVERSATIONS OF. THE ACTUAL HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE OF THIS INDUSTRY LOOKS LIKE AND HOW WE ACTUALLY TRULY. DO A JUST TRANSITION THANK YOU. THANK A MISFIRE HERE HERE THAT THAT THAT THAT BECAUSE I ANSWERED THE QUESTION POSED THIS IS BRAD HAD HER- CALIFORNIA SOLAR STORAGE ASSOCIATION AND THE PANELISTS IN OPPOSITION AND TO ANSWER THE FIRST QUESTION- JONATHAN SCOTT IS NOT A PAID CONSULTANT AND SPOKESPERSON OF SUN RUN AND. IS NOT PAID BY ANYONE TO APPEAR TODAY. THE SECOND QUESTION WAS SIERRA A LICENSE CONTRACTOR IN THE STATE. I DO NOT KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION. THANK YOU MISTER ARCHAEON. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE LEARNED A LOT JUST BY READING ANALYSIS ON THIS BILL. AND THEM IS COMPLICATED AND I ALSO AM A ROOFTOP SOLAR CUSTOMER. AB BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS MOST ARE DOING TO ME IN READING THIS ANALYSIS WITH THAT CHART. THEY LAID OUT THE AMOUNT OF COST SHIFTING THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST BUT ALSO WHAT WE PROJECT TO SEE IN THE FUTURE IN THE AMOUNT OF GROWTH IN COST SHIFTING. AND I DO REALLY WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR- UNDER EFFORTS ON THIS BILL WHICH ARE. LARGEST NOT AN EASY EFFORT- TO REALLY LOOK AT THAT QUESTION BECAUSE WE SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS THING BETWEEN COMMUNITIES THEY COULD AFFORD SOLAR. AND THOSE THEY CANNOT OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THEY DON'T GET THE BENEFITS OF THIS PROGRAM. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE PC SHOULD HAVE ALREADY DONE. YEAH AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE SAY THAT HERE TODAY. THAT IS THE BODY WITH OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY OVER THE P. YOU SEE THEY HAVE FAILED TO DO WHAT THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO DO TODAY. AND I THINK IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US TO URGE THEM TO DO IT. AND TO DO IT RIGHT THEY'RE THE ONES WITH THE EXPERTISE. TO DO THIS IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE. AND ONE OF MY CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL IS THAT ALTHOUGH I ABSOLUTELY LOVED. THE EFFORTS OF THE AUTHOR AND I THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE ALREADY READY AUTHOR WANTS US TO BE WHICH IS NOT SHIFTING THOSE COSTS. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT- I SHERM MISTER TINGS. CONCERNS ABOUT THE STRIKING OF ENSURING. THAT CUSTOMER SITED RENEWABLES CONTINUES TO GROW SUSTAINABLY AND I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM WITH THAT. BUT AS SOMEONE WHO REPRESENTS. A COMMUNITY WHERE WE ACTUALLY HAVE AN AREA THAT HAS SEEN A GROWTH IN SOLAR FARMS IN SOME OF THE LARGER. SOLAR INSTALLATIONS IT'S HARD TO GET THOSE DONE. THE PERMITTING IT'S HARD IT HAS TO BE NEAR. CONNECTIONS TO UTILITIES IN ORDER FOR IT TO PAN OUT WHICH ISN'T ALWAYS TRUE. THERE'S A LOT OF FIGHTS LIKE THE ONE WE SAW TODAY WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY NOT WHEN YOU SEE THAT OPEN SPACE TURNED INTO A SOLAR FARM. AND IT WAS A RESULT OF ALL OF THAT. I THINK THAT ROOFTOP SOLAR HAVE TO BE A PART OF. OUR ANSWER TO GETTING TO A 1100% CLEAN FUTURE WHICH I KNOW THE AUTHOR AGREES WITH I KNOW SHE DOES NOT INTEND TO KILL ROOFTOP SOLAR NOR DOES. SHE BELIEVE THIS. THIS SAID SHE IS THAT BUT I DO THINK WE NEED A BALANCE BETWEEN. ELIMINATING THE COST SHIFTING WHICH IS UNACCEPTABLE AND ENSURING THAT WE ARE. INCENTIVIZING SOLAR SUIT ROOFTOP SOLAR SO CONTINUES TO GROW. AND I'M SORRY TO SEE THE PARTS OF THE BILL THAT INCENTIVIZE DID ESPECIALLY OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES REMOVED I THOUGHT THAT WAS. A WONDERFUL EFFORT EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY WHICH IS INCENTIVIZING. SOLAR SO I REALLY HOPE THAT WE GET TO A. PLACE WHERE THE P. C. DOES THIS. AND CHANGES THE DYNAMIC THAT IS ON A- TO. AND DOES IT IN A THEY CAN TO. SCHOOL THIS PART OF OUR RENEWABLE FUTURE TO. GROW AND THRIVE AND PROVIDE ENERGY IN THE WAY THAT DOES TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SEEN NO FURTHER COMMENTS FROM. MEMBERS I DO I HAVE A MOTION. A MISSED I APOLOGIZE MISTER MAYES. AS MICROPHONE UP. THINK ABOUT CHAIR SO I HAVE A LOTS OF QUESTIONS BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE- THIS THE BILL CAME UP- WAS SAVED GOD WELL IT WAS GUTTED- AND THERE'S- THERE'S NEW LANGUAGE I THINK- IN HERE- AND- SO I'M AND I'M KIND OF STRUGGLING FRANKLY. I WITH WHERE I'M AT ON THIS BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE THE COST OF EITHER- FACT THAT IS IT IS NOT AN OPINION IS A FACT- IT WAS A POLICY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO SUBSIDIZE ROOFTOP SOLAR AT THE BEGINNING. A WHEN IT WAS IN ITS IN ITS INFANCY- IT IS NO LONGER IN ITS INFANCY- WHY DO WE KNOW THAT WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE IT'S THREE BILLION DOLLAR COST SHIFT AND WE JUST HEARD ALL OF THEM THE SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS THAT HAVE FORMED- A THIRD TO PROTECT AT THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY AND OF COURSE. THAT'S WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUTTHREE BILLION THREE BILLION DOLLARS AT THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW I REPRESENT A DESERT A COMMUNITY WE HAVE AN AWFUL LOT OF ROOFTOP SOLAR IN MY DISTRICT A LOT OF ROOFTOP SOLAR AND IN THE SUMMERTIME. WE DON'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THAT SEA BREEZE I FOR SOME OF THE COASTAL COMMUNITIES AND YOU KNOW OUR ELECTRIC BILLS AREN'T TWO HUNDRED OR THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH THEY ARE EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH A THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. AND THIS SOLAR ENERGY IS- IS REALLY SOMETHING THAT IS- IS SO IMPORTANT JUST JUST FOR OUR LOCAL ECONOMY AND SO I'M STRUGGLING SORT OF BACK AND FORTH ON WHAT TO DO WITH THIS WHAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT WE NEED TO ACTUALLY HAVE A REAL. CONVERSATION ABOUT IT SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO SUBSIDIZE- THIS- THIS IS NOT A INTO INDUSTRY LONG LONGER WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO SUBSIDIZE IT SO IF I CAN'T IF THERE'S SOMEBODY TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER- MAYBE A FEW A FEW QUESTIONS- ONE OF THEM- IS- ON I'M LOOKING AT PAGE SEVEN OF THE ANALYSIS WHERE IT TALKS ABOUT NAM ONE. POINT OH- IN TWO POINT OH- IT'S- THE LEGACY. FROM ONE POINT OH TO POINT OH THIS THREE POINT OH TERROR I DON'T KNOW THAT MEANS SO THE RATES THAT WERE PUT IN UNDER NAB ONE POINT OH ARE STILL IN EXISTENCE FOR THOSE- SOLAR CUSTOMERS THEY PROBABLY REAP THE BENEFITS BEYOND. IMAGINABLE AND GOTTEN THEIR MONEY BACK ON ON THE FULLER INSTITUTE TO. THE NEXT REITERATION WITH NUMBER TWO POINT NOW. THIS WOULD BE NUMBER THREE POINT OH TO RESTRUCTURE AGAIN THE RATES THAT IT AND HOW ARE CALCULATING THOSE RATES WHAT IT SAYS IS THOSE EARLIER CUSTOMERS. THE BILL NOW SAYS WILL EASE IN IN THE AGREEMENT I MADE JUST A FEW MINUTES GO WITH MISTER KING IS OVER TEN YEARS THEY WILL EASE INTO THESE NEW RATES SO. IF FOR IT. AND I'M A PERFECT EXAMPLE WE GOT SOLAR LAST YEAR- AND SO WE WERE STRUCTURING OUR HE BACK IF YOU WILL. BASED ON THE NAMM TWO POINT OH RATES IT WOULD ENSURE THAT I KEEP THOSE RATES FOR TEN YEARS SO WOULD BE PAID OFF- BEFORE YOU KNOW THE BIGGEST SUBSIDY WOULD BE GONE. THE PROBLEM IS ESPECIALLY WITH THE NO ONE POINT OH CUSTOMERS IS WE ARE OVER SUBSIDIZING. WHICH WE DIDN'T JUST INCENTIVIZE YOU KNOW THEY THEY PAY BACK THEIR SYSTEM. IN THERE NOT JUST GETTIN THEIR SAVINGS OF SOLAR THEY'RE GETTING- REALLY SUBSIDIZED ON THEIR PAYMENT TO THE GREAT AND THAT'S WHAT WE EVENTUALLY NEED TO GET AWAY FROM. SO MAYBE THE ONE OTHER WAY OF ASKING THIS QUESTION IS IF YOU ARE PUTTING ON A HUGE CAPITAL OUTLAY OUT YOUR SPENDING 300-004-0000 WHATEVER THE AMOUNT IS. YOU MAKE THAT DECISION BASED UPON A PROMISE OR WHETHER THE CONTRACT WITH ITS IMPLIED OR NOT- THAT. IF I PUT THIS ON TODAY I AM GOING TO GET THIS BENEFIT COMING OUT ARE WE CHANGING- THAT DEAL- OR OR WHERE WHERE SEND SETTING OUT THAT DEAL SO NOBODY WILL BE IN A SITUATION WHERE IT DIDN'T MAKE. SENSE TO GET THE SOLAR THAT THEY LOST MONEY ON THE SOLAR WE'RE GOING TO PRESERVE THEIR ABILITY TO MAK MONEY ON THEIR SOLAR BUT THEY'RE GOING TO QUIT MAKING AS MUCH MONEY ON. THEIR SOLAR AT TEN YEARS FROM NOW. BECAUSE YOU'RE SAYING THAT THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN PAID BY. THE SYSTEMS ARE BE PAID BACK IN AS A THEY'RE MAKING MONEY. OFF OF- OFF THE TOP THE GRID HAVING TO BUY THEIR EXCESS SOLAR GET AND THEN THE OTHER OF MAYBE ONE OTHER QUESTION IF I CAN MADAM. MADAM CHAIR IS- UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS THE FIRST HEARING RIGHT THIS IS THE OF THE FIRST YEAR TO TWO YEAR SESSION. AND THERE ARE- BILLS THAT COME UP- AND WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A- REAL CONVERSATION AND REAL DISCUSSION. AND SOMETIMES THE LEGISLATURE HAS TO DO THINGS. TO MAKE OTHER AGENCIES- BEGIN TO WORK ITS WAY UNDER. I UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT IS US HAVING THIS BILL THIS VEHICLE TO CONTINUE TO MOVE. SO THAT WE CAN MAYBE FOR SOME OTHER AGENCY LIKE THE P. YOU SEE- TO- TO DO WHAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO DO. SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO ME HERE IS THAT THE WHOLE POINT OF THE COMMISSION. IS IT FOR TO BE NONPOLITICAL AND YET THEY FOUND THERE'S A LOT OF THESE COMMISSIONS. THAT ACTS A VERY POLITICAL- AND IF THE POLITICAL BODIES THE ONE IT'S ACTUALLY HAVING TO COME INTO FORCE. IN FORCES ACTUALLY UPSIDE THE UPSIDE DOWN OR BACKWARDS. THAT'S HOW IMPORTANT IS IT THAT THIS OF THIS VEHICLE MOVES SO IT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND- I THINK THAT IT WAS MADE EVEN MORE STRIKINGLY IMPORTANT BY THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS BECAUSE IT. DOESN'T IF YOU SEE ACCESS IT DOESN'T GO INTO EFFECT THEY CAN MAKE A NEW. RATE STRUCTURE- WE ARE JUST SAYING IT'S TIME FOR THE PC TO ACT IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO ACT WILL LEGISLATE ON IT OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE FOR THE PC TO ACT. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU X. HONORING MY MEMBERS WE HAVE OR BILL. AND WE NEED VACATE BY FOUR THIRTY BUT- THE DISCUSSION A IMPORT. THIS WAY IF. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR EIGHT I SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE COMES FROM MISTER KING- MAYES- AND I THINK. MOST OF THAT HAS BEEN RESOLVED I THINK THAT. THE LAST QUESTION FROM FROM- THE GENTLEMAN FROM YOUR FIVE K. IS THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTINUING THIS CONVERSATION ALL RIGHT. I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND FROM THE OPPOSITION I THINK THOSE ARE NOT TAKEN LIGHTLY. AND MAKING SURE THAT THE CUT CONVERSATION CONTINUES AND THAT THIS BILL. MOVES FORWARD AND IN THE END YOU'RE RIGHT WE WANT TO DO YOU SEE TO. DO THE WORK. WE'RE ASKING THEM TO DO SO- I FOR TODAY I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. RESERVE MY RIGHT TO A DIFFERENCE WHEN IT COMES BACK TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENED. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. BILL REMEMBERS BURKE SECOND ALBUM IS CARILLO MR GARCIA A BE BRIEF THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY A FEW WORDS I. MY COLLEAGUE FROM RESTAURANTS I THINK HE MOVED FROM YUCAIPA YUCCA VALLEY NOW TO FRENCH BRONZE. TWENTY TERRIFIED THAT HE MAKES SOME EXCELLENT POINTS. OUT WE SHARE THE DESERT COMMUNITIES- ALIKE AND THE SOLAR INDUSTRY CERTAINLY HAS REACHED OUT TO US AND SAID HEY THIS IS GOING TO BE ONE. A JOCULAR MAYBE YOU CAN BE ADDRESSED THAT POINT IN YOUR CLOSING COMMENTS NUMBER TWO. YOU KNOW- I SEE THIS AS US PUSHING THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. TO DO THEIR JOB- THE JOB THAT THEY'VE BEEN TAKEN DOWN THE ROAD FOR QUITE SOME TIME. AND THEN THE CORE OF THE BILL TO THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE EAGLE ROCK AREA- THIS IS ABOUT ADDRESSING SOME INEQUITY- FORMULAS- THAT HAS BEEN OVERBURDENING. SUBPOPULATION FOR OTHERS TO BENEFIT FROM GETTING SOLAR YOU KNOW MAYBE IN YOUR CLOSING COMMENTS YOU CAN ALSO SHARE WITH US HOW THIS WILL BE BECAUSE MY WHOLE PURPOSE IN GOLDEN. ENGAGING INTO THE CLIMATE SPACE. DISCUSSIONS IS HOW DO WE HAVE POOR PEOPLE. THE PART OF. THE BENEFITS OF OUR PAUL ARE POOR PEOPLE GETS OLDER. UNDER UNDER HOUSES HARDLY ARE POOR PEOPLE IN E. V. VEHICLES TO TRY TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES HOW DO WE MAKE SURE. AS ONE OF OUR FORMER LEADERS THE SENATE USED TO SAY THE MARKET TIES ARE CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES IN CALIFORNIA. FOR PURPOSES OF BRINGING EVERYONE ALONG AND MAYBE YOU CAN ADDRESS THOSE. IN YOUR CLOSING COMMENTS AS IT RELATES TO THIS BILL THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU WILL MOVE ON TO THE SERVER IS TO CHANGE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATED THE AUTHORS THE LAST COMMENT ABOUT THE- AGREEMENT THAT IDEALLY THE PC SHOULD BE ACTING ON THIS BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT THE PC HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS LENGTHY STAKEHOLDER. DRIVEN PROCESS AND SO- I'M HOPING THAT THE PC WILL DO THE JOB I MEAN. AND CLEARLY- THIS BILL RACES- IN ISSUE THAT WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING FOR A LONG TIME THIS ISSUE OF COST SHIFTING- OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT FAIR THAT- THAT LOW INCOME PEOPLE ARE. CARRYING THE BURDEN OF- OF- AND THAT THE- THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO. INSTALL SOLAR- HAVE BEEN ABLE TO AVOID IN TERMS OF THE MANY OF THE COSTS- THAT- THAT- THEY THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO AVOID- THIS IS BEEN A THIS IS A DIFFICULT BILL FOR ME I MEAN ON THE ONE HAND OBVIOUSLY I DON'T TO- I WANT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF COST SHIFTING I WANT TO SUPPORT. THE GOOD UNION JOBS- THAT WOULD- GO TOWARD- THE- BILL'S PROPOSAL ON THE OTHER HAND I. I DON'T LIKE LOOKING AT THE LETTERS I MEAN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE- THE CONCERNS- REYES ON THIS BILL YOU KNOW FRANKLY DON'T SEEM TO BE ADDRESSED. IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THE COMMITTEE NOW ALSO STRUCK ME AS MORE OF AN EDITORIAL THAT A- OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS OF A- OF A MANY DEDUCTIONS- REYES LIKE FOR EXAMPLE I SEE THAT THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL IS IN SUPPORT AND CONCEPT. SO DOESN'T SEEM LIKE ALL OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS ARE IN UNANIMITY IN OPPOSITION- AND SO BOTTOM LINE ITEM I. WELL NOW BE VOTING TODAY AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW THIS BILL CONTINUES TO DEVELOP THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE RIGHT I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER WORK ON THIS AND FOR AGREEING TO THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS I WILL ASK HER FOR HER CLOSING COMMENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU AND- THE PC HAS HAD THE MANDATE TO TAKE CARE OF THIS FOR A WHILE AND THE THEY THE MORE WE ASKED THE MORE GETS PUSHED OFF- SO DOES BEAR. ON US TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS I LIVE IN A COMMUNITY QUITE FRANKLY I LIVE A LIFE WHERE I TRY TO BE GUILT FREE LIVE IN A COMMUNITY THAT MOST PEOPLE CANNOT AFFORD ROOFTOP SOLAR IT EITHER BECAUSE THEY DON'T OWN THEIR ACTUAL HOUSE THAT THEY'RE LIVING IN OR IT'S JUST TOO EXPENSIVE AN OUTLAY AND INSTEAD THEY'RE BEARING THE BRUNT OF ME. PUTTING SOLAR ON MY HOUSE. THERE'S SOMETHING PERVERTED ABOUT THAT AND SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ADD A FAIRNESS TO. DO WE HAVE TO FIND WAYS FOR WORKING CLASS FOLKS AND POOR FOLKS TO HAVE. TO BENEFIT AS AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID FROM FROM THE GREEN ECONOMY WE DO WE DO AND I TRIED TO PUT SOME OF THAT INTO THE BILL. THE COMMITTEE NOW SAYS WANTED TO JUST DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE WHICH I'M WILLING TO DO AND COME BACK AND DEAL WITH SOME OF THE INCENTIVES ON THE OTHER. I DO THINK WE HAVE TO GET WE WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO INCENTIVIZE SOLAR- AND SOME POINTS FOR SOME CUSTOMERS FOR A VERY LONG TIME. THAT IS THAT IS A PROGRAM WE SHOULD BE WORKING ON AS WELL. BUT IT IS NOT- EQUITABLE IT IS NOT FAIR- TO CONTINUE TO HAVE. FOR EXAMPLE AND THE GERMANFROM NO LONGER FROM YUCAIPA PREVIOUSLY FROM YUCAIPA. WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE THOSE SUMMERTIME BILLS THINK ABOUT THIS THE SUMMERTIME BILLS WHEN YOU CAN'T AFFORD SOLAR. AND IT'S TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. IN RISING BECAUSE MORE PEOPLE ARE GETTING SOLAR AND SHIFTING THOSE COSTS TO YOU THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG THERE. AND SO IT IS UP TO US TO TRY TO CORRECT IT. DESPITE SOME OF THE OPPOSITION'S COMMENTS I DON'T THINK ANYONE HERE HATE SOLAR NOBODY'S GOING TO KILL SOLAR WE HAVE A SOLAR MANDATE ON NEW CONSTRUCTION OF HOUSES. THAT IT IS IT IS- TERROR LANGUAGE LIKE THAT THAT IS SCARING PEOPLE OUT OF COMMONSENSE REFORMS THAT CAN BENEFIT ENTIRE COMMUNITIES. AND QUITE FRANKLY SOMEBODY WHO. CONSIDERS HERSELF A MEMBER OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY IT IS DISHEARTENING.TO SEE THE DISMISSAL OF THE COST SHIFTING ISSUE. BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT I FEEL STRONGLY ENOUGH TO TAKE THE CRITICISM. FROM FOR HIM THE OPPONENTS TO TRY TO DEAL WITH. THAT THERE'S PROBABLY. JUST THE PRICE OF LIVING IT IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST ISSUE IN MY DISTRICT AND I KNOW SOME OF YOU HAVE THE SAME TYPE JUST. TRYING TO GET BY YOUR ELECTRICITY BILL. SO WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. IT WON'T MAKE ME THE MOST POPULAR ENVIRONMENTALISTS THE STATE WHAT WE TRY TO DO IT I'M OKAY WITH THAT BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE STRETCHING AND WILLING TO LET THIS CONVERSATION MOVE. SO THAT WE CAN PUSH THE P. YOU SEE HOPEFULLY TO DO THEIR JOB. AT PREVAILING WAGE DISTILLER WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE ALL ALONG AND FINALLY GET THEM RIGHT. SO WITH THAT RESPECT LAST NIGHT ABOUT.

IT'S BEEN MOTION BY MISS BURKE SECOND THAT RAMOS CARILLO SPARKING ON THE FOR SERVICE THANK YOU M. THANK. FIRST I WOULD IMAGINE THE PART OF THE BILL WHERE YOU ASK FOR HAVING DIVERSITY ON THE COMMISSIONERS I THINK THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL FOR A WHOLE HOST OF REASONS AND SOMEONE MENTIONED TODAY AND EVEN IN MY WORK HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE I FIND THAT WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE. WHO LIVE IN DIFFERENT UTILITIES YOUR GRAPHIC AREAS THEY SEE IT DIFFERENTLY RIGHT AND I JUST THINK THAT REPRESENTATION IS REALLY CRITICAL SO I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE I DID WANT TO ASK YOU TO DISCUSS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY WE WOULD BE MOVING THE HEADQUARTERS A LOOK LIKE THEREWOULDN'T BE AN INCREDIBLE DESPITE THE FACT THAT I WAS SURPRISED THAT WE WOULDN'T SEE ANY. COST SAVINGS BY MOVING TO STOCKTON IT APPEARED THE ANALYSIS THAT THAT MAY BE THE CASE AND I WHAT I DID SHARE THE CONCERNS OF SEIU ONE THOUSAND THAT WE WOULD BE DISPLACING HUNDREDS OF WORKERS. WHO LIVE AND WORK CURRENTLY IN SAN FRANCISCO AND HAVE SPECIALIZED SKILLS IN THIS. AND WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE FOR THE WORKERS. BERRIES ARE GIVE VERY VERY. I MEAN IT'S WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF FOLKS THAT ARE JUST MOVING. ELSE ELSEWHERE FROM THERE AND- I MEAN I HAVE EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND CARS THAT LEAVE. FROM OUR DISTRICT OUT TO DRIVE. I MEAN IT'S JUST GETTING TOUGHER AND TOUGHER- MY DISTRICT IS A MELTING POT I MEAN IT'S YOU YOU NAME IT WE HAVE ACTED YOU NAME WHATEVER RACE WE HAVE IT. AND I JUST THINK THAT YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS SEEM TO GET. PASSED OVER. AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU KNOW WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUT STOCKTON ON THE MAP. BUT ALSO NOT JUST STOCKTON RIGHT IT'S JUST THIS IS REALLY TO DIVERSIFY AND- TO WORK. WITH WITH THROUGHOUT THE STATE NOT JUST SAYING BAY AREA THIS ONE AREA THIS IS THIS IS WE ARE. WILLING TO YOU KNOW AT ANY THE MINISTERS. THE WHOLE THING IS A REALLY TO WORK WITH OTHERS. SO I AM HERE I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE CONSIDER SPECIALLY GIVEN THE COST OF KEEPING THAT OFFICE SPACE IN SAN FRANCISCO AT THE STATE BUILDING ISN'T INCREDIBLY HIGH BASED ON THE ANALYSIS. THAT WE ALLOW THE WORKERS THAT ARE CURRENTLY BASED THERE. TO A POTENTIALLY STAY THERE AND MAYBE HAVE AN ADDITIONAL YOU KNOW WE HAVE OFFICES IN LA SACRAMENTO AND SAN FRANCISCO RIGHT NOW AND LOOK AT THE OPTION OF ADDING BUT NOT DISPLACING ALL THOSE WORKERS I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T DISRUPT THEM ANDTHEIR FAMILIES. AND WE KEEP THE CONTINUITY OF THEIR EXPERTISE. THANK YOU. THE COURT. THE AUTHOR HOW TO SACRAMENTO CAPT IS IT BAY AREA ORG CENTRAL VALLEY- SACRAMENTO YEAH. WE CALL THAT PART OF THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT IT'S PART OF THE CENTRAL OKAY SO A MAJORITY OF THE COMMISSIONERS COME FROM SACRAMENTO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM. WELL I MEAN I DO WE DO WE NEVER HAVE HAD ANYONE ON THE COMMISSION. YOU GO UP TO. BAKERSFIELD YOU KNOW- FRESNO STOCKTON WE'VE NEVER HAD ENDED IT JUST AGAIN LIKE I SAID IT IT JUST SEEMS THAT. THIS YEAR IT JUST SEEMS TO GET PASSED OVER YOU KNOW SO I'M REALLY TRYING TO FIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M NOT TRYING TO TAKE AWAY FROM ME ANY OTHER. CITIES I'M TRYING TO MAKE THIS UNIFIED. FACT THAT OUR CITY ALSO. IS LIKE I SAID IT'S A MELTING POT YOU KNOW THIS IS THIS IS THESE ARE. OUR COMMUNITY SHOULD BELONG. AND THAT'S WHAT I TRY TO DO IS PUSHED OUT MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS. THANK THANK YOU. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY I APPRECIATE THE EQUITY COMPONENT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS YOUR BILL HAVE A COMMUNITY THAT'S OFTEN LOOKED LOOKED PAST THE AND NOT INCLUDED SO IF YOU DID THAT I DO HAVE SOME CURRENT CONCERNS ABOUT THAT PART OF THOSE FILLING IN THOSE SCHOOLS BEING LOST- WHEN WE'RE DISCUSSING MOVING THE AGENCY AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT MA'AM AS YOU TAKE AND THAT IT'S ONLY A CONSIDERATION AND NOT A MANDATE- AND THERE BUT- AS THIS BILL PROCEEDS UNDER DISCUSSION FOR A PROCEED- I THINK AT SOME POINT MAYBE CONSIDERING IF- CONVOLUTED IN THE CONVERSATION AS WE'RE TRYING TO ELEVATE.

FIVE ELEVEN ZERONOS THANK YOU THINK THAT BILLS THAT WILL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS NEXT WE HAVE ITEM. SIX FIVE EIGHTY FOUR TWENTY SEVEN BY BARKHANE HAN ELECTRICITE RESOURCE ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS YOU MAY BEGIN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR AND STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL AND DISCUSSING IMPORTANT LEGISLATION THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US AND I WANT TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S AMENDMENT. TODAY PROUD TO PRESENT EIGHTY FOUR TWENTY SEVEN AS A NEEDED STEP FORWARD TO RELIABLE CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE FOR CALIFORNIA LAST SUMMER WE SAW DRASTIC RESULTS OF THE FAILURES IN OUR SYSTEM WITH EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMES AND BUSINESSES LOST POWER FULLER GLOBAL COMMUNITIES WERE LEFT IN THE DARK IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC AT THE SAME TIME WE HAD ENOUGH ENERGY STORED IN BEHIND THE METER STORAGE OR IN OUR BATTERY SUPPLIES. TO SUPPLY COMMUNITIES WITH THE CRITICAL NEEDED POWER THE HORRIBLE BLACKOUTS WERE SYMPTOM OF LARGER ISSUES WITH HIGH DEMAND CALIFORNIA IS THE COUNTRY'S NUMBER ONE ENERGY IMPORTER A QUARTER OF OUR ENERGY IS IMPORTED FROM OUT OF STATE AND HIGH COST OF REPAIRS HOWEVER WE HAVE PLENTY OF ENERGY FROM SOLAR DURING THE DAY BUT NO ACCESS TO THAT ENERGY ONCE IT'S STORED IN BATTERIES AT NIGHT THERE IS NO NEED TO BUILD A NEW POWER PLANT- BY MORE ENERGY FROM UTAH AND COLORADO. WE HAVE THE ENERGY WE NEED SOARED IN THE THOUSANDS OF BATTERIES AT HOMES. AND BUSINESSES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. AB FOR TWENTY SIMPLY REQUIRES THE P. YOU SEE EACH DEVELOP REGULATIONS. TO FULLY UTILIZE THE RELIABLE CLEAN ENERGY STORED IN BEHIND THE METER BATTERIES. THESE BATTERIES WILL SHORE UP THE GRID AND OFFSET THE PRICE SPIKES. THAT AREPASSED ON TO RATEPAYERS AND I THINK THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT WHEN WE HAVE THESE ENERGY SPIKES BECAUSE THERE IS A MASSIVE DEMANDED ENERGY. WE PAY THE HIGHEST COSTS FOR ENERGY TO IMPORTED FROM OUT OF STATE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CHARTS OF WHAT WE WERE PAYING IN AUGUST FOR ENERGY. THAT IS CAUSING AN INCREASE IN RATES THAT ARE BEING PAID BY OUR CONSUMERS AND IF WE CAN DRIVE THAT COSTS DOWN BY USING BEHIND THE METER ENERGY. R. COSTA REPAIRS WILL GO DOWN. THE ENERGY NEWLY AVAILABLE WILL HELP PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S MOST BLACKOUTS AND THE REGULATIONS WILL LIKE CLEAN ENERGY INSTALLATION MORE AFFORDABLE. STORAGE IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE. THIS BILL ALLOWS US TO STEP UP AND UTILIZE THE STORAGE WE ALREADY HAVE. THE BILL IS SUPPORTED BY CLEAN ENERGY ADVOCATES IN INDUSTRY AND WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT- LIST OUST. BOARD PRESIDENT OF THE RANDY UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT AND RACHEL.

PROVIDE LOCAL RELIANCE. PROVIDE ENHANCED TO BE AND ELECT SYSTEM. ASSEMBLY RESILIENCY. AND CUSTOMER LEVEL SERVICES AS TRYING TO YOU FELT MANAGED PEAK ROAD SHOW AN PROVIDING UP POWER TO COST AND AMOUNT OF GRATITUDE. WE NOW OUR FIRST CALL IN TWENTY NINETEEN WITH EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY WHICH WILL BE LOCATED ON SITE AND WEST OAKLAND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AREA AND WILL HELP TO OFFSET THE LEGACY JET FUEL POWER PLANTS IN THAT AREA WE SEEK OUT PROJECTS. WITH SIMILAR COMMANDED THAT. AND I ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAUER K. MENTION DETECT PROJECT ALTHOUGH HUGE POTENTIAL FOR THE STATE AND COULD BE TO. AGREE POWER TO CUSTOMERS AND THE NEIGHBORHOODS PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF. AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE FOR BACK UP GENERATION. SO POWER PLANT BECAUSE WITH THE- HELP THE CALLOUS. BY CERTAIN. ON THE CLASS TWENTY THREE PROJECTIONS FROM THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION SHOW AT THIS TIME RESOURCE ADEQUACY NEED HAVE BETWEEN SEVEN THOUSAND AND- ONE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS. JUST A FEW SHORT YEARS FROM NOW. I ANALYSIS TO THE BY RUN STATION A AND NINETEEN FOUND THAT THE TECHNICAL. FOR VIRTUAL POWER PLANT WITH ABOUT NINE THOUSAND MAKE A LOT STATEWIDE. THE THREE THIRTY THAT ARE CLOSE TO LOAD AND DO NOT REQUIRE ANY TRANSMISSION OF ANTICIPATION WE CONTROL OUR BATTERIES REMOTELY AND GET INSIGHT INTO HOW MUCH POWER THE BATTERIES HAVE AND- ANY GIVEN TIME. AND IMPORTANTLY WE'RE ABLE TO DISPATCH OUR BATTERIES CAN MEET OUR REPORTS ADEQUATELY OBLIGATIONS WITHOUT HARMING THE CUSTOMER. NOT A MAJOR BARRIERS FOR THE PRODUCTS WHICH EIGHTY FOUR TWENTY SEVEN TO LEVY A IS THAT BEHIND IT OR STORAGE SYSTEM DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE A CAPACITY OF METHODOLOGY TO QUALIFY FOR REFER SIDE OF THE CITY AND WHAT THIS MEANS AS- THEY DO NOT COUNTY MARIE PHOTOGRAPHY PROSPECTUS. TODAY VIRTUAL POWER PLANT PROJECTS MISUSED THE METHODOLOGY DESIGNED FOR DEMAND RESPONSE RESOURCES WITH YOU THE BASIC PLAN APPROACH AND DO NOT RECOGNIZE ANY EXPORT FROM THE FUNDS TO THE GRAD. NOT TAKEN TOGETHER THESE TWO ELEMENTS. NEED A REDUCTION IN THE ACTUAL VALUE BY ANYWHERE FROM 6270% DEPENDING ON THE CONFIGURATION. NOW FOUR SEVEN WITH TERRIER BY THE PC HAS SET UPON TO PASS BY THE BEHIND METER STORE. IN THAT'S EXPORT. IN THE FIFTH. JUNE WERE REVERSED AFTER THAT THE INTO TWENTY TO. FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY THREE YEAR HOME RUN OTHERS HAVING MULTIPLE PROPOSAL AS THE PC 3% OF THE PRECEDING AND WHILE ONE WORKSHOP. IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR- BASED ON EVERYTHING WE UNDERSTAND TODAY IT IS NOT BEING ADDRESSED AND WILL NOT BE IN THIS YEAR THE FISH ON HOW I DID WANT TO SPEAK TO A FEW I THINK MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE PHONE. ON A REMAIN YOU HAVE BEEN IN THIS LIMIT YOU COULD PLEASE SEPARATE COMMONSENSE. OKAY YES I HAVE ABOUT OR SO. ON THE BILL WE NOT REQUIRE YOU TO BUY CAPACITY BEHIND STORAGE BUT IT WOULD ADVANCE BEHIND THE METER STAR SYSTEM OVER OTHER RESOURCES EITHER BY GETTING THEM MORE VALUE OR A HIGHER COST. I RECESSES WOULD STILL HAVE TO BE SELECTED ON THE COSTS AND BENEFITS WE BE COMPETING WITH ALL OTHER RESOURCES. AND FINALLY IT WOULD NOT CIRCUMVENT ANY ANALYSIS BY THE PC BUT BUILT NOT PRESCRIPTIVE AND WOULD NOT CIRCUMVENT STAFF ANALYSIS. FOR PUBLIC COMMENT INTO THE PROCESS ALL IT DOES THIS BY THE DEADLINE. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS THANK YOU. FOR MODERATOR- WE HAVE LIST DOES. WITH ARE IN THE UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT YOU MAY PROCEED WITH YOUR TESTIMONY. GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR NUMBERS MY NAME IS WITHOUT AND I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES FOR THE AROUND THE UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT WERE SMALLER DISTRICTS FEATURE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS PUT FOUR ON THE STREET SCHOOL ONE MIDDLE SCHOOL. AND WE'RE LOCATED IN A HIGH FIRE THREAT STONE WE ALSO HAVE A LIMITED BUDGET ONE OF THE LOWER FUNDED DISTRICTS IN THE STATE IN TERMS OF OUR LTFS FUNDING. EIGHTY FOUR TWENTY SEVEN. WOULD HELP OUR DISTRICT TO GET TO GET ME. PROVIDING RESILIENCY IN CRITICAL BACKUP POWER TO OUR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY. AT THE SAME TIME THAT ENABLED US TO BE USEFUL RESOURCE FOR THE GRIT. WE HAVE FULLER SYSTEMS INVOLVING ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS. BUT ALONE THEY DON'T PROTECT AGAINST POWER OUTAGES. ADDING BATTERIES WOULD OFFER MANY BENEFITS TO THE SCHOOLS IN THE LARGER COMMUNITY. MAKING A MUCH MORE RESILIENT. AND SEVERE HEAT ENERGY TO IS USUALLY HIGHER AFTER SCHOOL IS OUT FOR THE DAY. WHEN SCHOOL BATTERY CAN SUPPLY ENERGY TO THE GRID. ARE GUESTS ARE GIVEN FORTUNATELY INDOOR MULTIPLE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF. AND IT HAD TO CANCEL SCHOOL CUTTING LOCKS INSTRUCTIONAL TIME SERIOUS DISRUPTIONS FOR OUR COMMUNITY. BLACKOUT CURRENTLY MEAN THE LOSS OF ESSENTIAL INSTRUCTIONAL DAYS IN AN UNSAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR TEACHING AND LEARNING. DURING THE PAST YEP YEP AND THEN WE HAD TO RELY ON EMERGENCY GENERATORS AND SPAGHETTI SAUCE ON SERVICE. THE GLOBAL LACK OF LIGHT VENTILATION IN CLASSROOM WE CHOSE TO TEACH DURING THE OUTAGES. BIRTH CONTROL COMPLETELY. DESPITE MANY BENEFITS. ARE DIFFERENT CURRENTLY CAN TO ADD BATTERY BECAUSE THE FOR CALL FOR Q. AB TWENTY SEVEN COULD CHANGE THAT BY ALLOWING THE BATTERY CAPACITY. THE VALUE OF BATTERY MAKES BETTER FINANCIAL SENSE. WE JUST GOT THE ENERGY STORAGE WITH PROVIDERS MORE CONFIDENT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO COMPETENTLY MANAGE OUR SYSTEM IN RESPONSE TO GREAT NEEDS. THE TIME WHEN THE GRAINY POWER THAT WE HAVE SOARED WE WANT TO BE A PUBLIC REPORT ESPECIALLY THE TIMING OF PEAK DEMAND PERIOD. WORKS SO WELL WITH OUR SCHOOL HOURS. ADDED VALUE THIS BILL WOULD HELP PROVIDE IN ORDER TO MAKE IT HAPPEN FOR OUR DISTRICT. AS WELL AS OTHERS IN HIGH FIRE THREAT STONE. PLEASE VOTE IN SUPPORT OF AB FOUR TO SEVEN THANK YOU SO MUCH.

GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE HOLDS EIGHT AROUND WHAT THE COSMIC SOLAR IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB FOUR TO SEVEN THANK YOU. AND AT THIS TIME THERE'S NO ONE ELSE IN HERE. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. MISTER PARK. TERRACE IS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD WE ALLOW RIGHT NOW THE I SO WHEN IT'S LOOKING AT DEMAND AND THINKS IT'S GOING TO BE- HIGHER THAN WE CAN GENERATE VAST PEOPLE NOT TO USE- THE ENERGY THAT THEY COULD IN RETURN THEY GET A DISCOUNT. THAT'S FINE. BUT AND I'M ALSO FINE WITH FRANKLY PUTTING THE DEADLINE ON THE CHAMBER ON THE COMMISSION THE PROBLEM I HAVE HERE IS ON PAGE FOUR LINE TWENTY NINE. SAYS A STATUS RULES THAT ALLOW DEMAND RESPONSE PROGRAMS AND RESOURCES PROCURED BY A LOAD SERVING ENTITY TO MAKE THE LOAD SERVING ENTITIES RESOURCE ASKING. ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE PROGRAM IS INTEGRATED INTO THE WHOLESALE MARKET. OVERSEEN BY THE ACT INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR IT SEEMS TO ME THAT LEAVES A BIG HOLE. BECAUSE IF THE INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATORS NOT PART OF IT HOW DOES IT BALANCE LOADS. YEAH SO PER COMMITTEE MANAGER ACTUALLY STRIKING THAT SO YOU YOU ARE FOURTEENTH ACTUALLY WHAT THE COMMITTEES SITE AND WE'RE LEAVING- SO THE MEAT OF THE BILL IS NOW ON THIS PAGE SEVEN K. WHICH CREATES V. M. BUT CAPACITY VALUATION METHODOLOGY. INTERESTS ARE CONCERNED YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GOT GOING HERE IN MY FOR HERE I'M SORRY I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU SAID OKAY. CAN I REPEAT. OKAY THE AMENDMENTS WHAT YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IS PART OF WHAT WE STRUCK FROM THE BATTLE HE DID STRIKE OUT OF THE WELL THAT'S GREAT- THAT MAKES THINGS A LOT MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD. THE OTHER CONCERN I HAVE IS. SO WE HEARD FROM THE SCHOOL AND THEY WANT THEIR BATTERY BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO EDUCATE THEIR KIDS WHEN THERE'S A POWER SHOT OFF. AND THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE SO THEY MAY HAVE KIDS STARTING AT EIGHT OR NINE IN THE MORNING GOING TO THREE THIRTY THERE'S A POWER SHOT OFF. THE TIME WHEN YOU MOST NEED PEOPLE TO BRING DOWN THEIR LOADS IS WHAT'S CALLED THE NAKED ATTACK BUT BASICALLY IT'S A PERIOD WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN UNTIL AROUND SIX OR SEVEN AT NIGHT THAT'S WHEN THE LOW JUST GOES LIKE CRAZY. THE PROBLEM IS THE I SO WILL NOT KNOW THAT THAT BATTERY. WAS USED BY THE SCHOOL. OR PERHAPS IN THE WHOLE REGION THAT'S LOW ON POWER THEY HAVE A WHOLE POWER SHUT OFF IN THE ISO JUSTICE AGAIN NO THIS. BECAUSE THE ISO DOESN'T KNOW IT'S LIKELY TO SAY OVER FINE. WE HAVE ALL THESE BATTERIES THAT CAN COME ONLINE AND THEY CAN'T. SO THAT'S THAT'S THE SORT OF PRACTICAL CONSIDERATION I'M WORRIED ABOUT YEAH AN OSTRICH MCMAHON TO ADDRESS THAT CENTER AND ACTUALLY HAS AN INTEREST MODEL I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT FOR WORKING ON THIS BILL WHERE THEY CONTROL THE BATTERIES SO THEY WITHHOLD ABOUT FIFTY REGIONAL CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT 50% FOR. THE SCHOOL AND TO THE HOME TO USE BUT THE REST IS ACTUALLY CONTROLLED TO PROVIDE THAT ADEQUACY AND THEY GUARANTEE IT AND REGIONAL CAN ELABORATE ON THAT BUT IT ADDRESSES EXACTLY CONCERNED YOU'RE- DISCUSSING YOUR HAVE TO ELABORATE ON. THE FOR THE BILL OKAY. THANK YOU MY SURPRISE. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY FURTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS MISS REYES. THANK YOU MANAGER I DO KNOW THAT THE BILL HAS BEEN AMENDED- QUITE A BIT AND HAS ADDRESSED SOME OF THE ISSUES- FROM. THE UTILITY WORKERS I B. W. AND OTHERS WHO WORK ON ON THIS.
