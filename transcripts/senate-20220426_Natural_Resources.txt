B. NINE FIFTY THREE SO CENTER MAN IF YOU'RE UP FOR TO PRESENT TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE WE APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION AND THANK YOU CHAIR STERN VERY GOOD THANK HIGH AND I WANT TO THANK COMMITTEE STAFF WHO'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH US ON THIS BILL AS WELL AS -- THE VERY STAKEHOLDERS BOTH IN SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSE WITH CLOSELY WITH I ALSO WANT TO BEGIN BY SAYING THAT WHEN I FIRST RAN FOR THE OFFICE I NOW HOLD I NEVER THOUGHT IT INTRODUCED A BILL LIKE THIS I DO BELIEVE CLIMATE CRISIS IS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT PERSONALIZATION I WE HAVE TO ACT BOLDLY AND DECISIVELY TO MEET THIS CHALLENGE HEAD ON AT THE SAME TIME I I FOCUS MY EFFORTS ON ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS AND I HAVE TO CONFESS DID NOT PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO THE TWENTY EIGHT PLATFORMS OFF THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA I IS HE SAID THAT'S ACTIVELY BEEN SUBJECT A MORATORIUM ON NEW DRILLING SINCE THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES BUT THEN THE EVENTS OF LAST FALL OCCURRED AND AS YOU ALL KNOW IN OCTOBER AND MAJOR OIL SPILL TOOK PLACE OFF THE COAST OF ORANGE COUNTY RIGHT OFF OF HUNTINGTON BEACH ORIGINATING FROM AN UNDERWATER PIPELINE CONNECTED TO PLATFORM ELLIE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND GALLONS OF OIL SPILLED INTO COASTAL WATERS KILLING BIRDS AND FISH FORCING BEACH CLOSURES AND HURTING LOCAL ECONOMIES IN HUNTINGTON BEACH NEWPORT BEACH AND LAGUNA BEACH WHICH IS THE CITIES I REPRESENT IT TOOK NEARLY FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE IN ALMOST THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO CLEAN UP THE SPILL NOT INCLUDING FEDERAL COSTS AND FRANKLY WE DODGED A BULLET THE HUNTINGTON BEACH OIL SPILL WAS ORIGINALLY PREDICTED TO BE MUCH MUCH WORSE ON AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE SIMILAR TO THE REFUGIO BEACH OIL SPILL IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WHICH SHUT DOWN SANTA BARBARA COASTLINE FOR SIX MONTHS FORTUNATELY THE SMELL THIS BILL IS MUCH SMALLER THAN EXPECTED AND WE ALSO BENEFITED FROM A TIMELY STORM THAT BLEW IN THE NEXT NIGHT PUSHING MOST OF THE OIL RESIDUE OUT TO SEA AND WE FOR OUR COASTLINE BUT NONE THE LESS THIS CLOSE OUR BEACHES FOR A WEEK I HAD A MASSIVE ECONOMIC IMPACT AND THEN JUST AS WE'VE BEEN CUT BECAUSE BEGUN RECOVERING FROM THIS EVENT ONLY TWO MONTHS AFTER THE SPILL A RUPTURE OIL PIPELINE FROM PLATFORM EVA EXPERIENCE ANOTHER LEAK NOW AS I SAID EARLIER I BELIEVE CLIMATE CHANGE IS A PRESSING ISSUE FOR US BUT EVEN IF YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THAT I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT THE RISKS POSED BY OFFSHORE DRILLING ARE NOT JUSTIFIED BY THEIR BENEFITS OFFSHORE OIL PRODUCTION IN BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE WATERS IN CALIFORNIA ACCOUNTS FOR LESS THAN POINT THREE PERCENT OF ANNUAL PRODUCTION UNITED STATES THAT'S NOT EVEN A DROP IN THE BUCKET AT THE SAME TIME THESE OFFSHORE RIGS THREATEN A VIBRANT CALIFORNIA COASTAL KANEMI THAT GENERATES FORTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND EMPLOYS OVER A HALF MILLION CALIFORNIANS FULL COASTLINE AND PRECIOUS MARINE ECOSYSTEMS ARE ALSO CORE PART OF AYE OUR IDENTITY IS CALIFORNIANS NOT ONLY IN COASTAL COMMUNITIES LIKE THE ONES I REPRESENT BUT ALSO ACROSS THE STATE PEOPLE FROM ENGLAND FLOCKED OUR BEACHES AND COASTLINES BECAUSE THIS IS PART OF WHO WE ARE A CORE PART OF WHO WE ARE CALIFORNIANS AND LET'S BE CLEAR THE PLATFORMS OFFER COSTAR KICKING TIME BOMBS THE REMAINING LEASES ARE LARGELY HELD BY THINLY CAPITALIZED FIRMS THAT DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO REPAY TAXPAYERS IN THE EVENT OF ANOTHER MAJOR OIL SPILL AND DON'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO INVEST IN AGING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE IN NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND NINETEEN EIGHTIES ANOTHER MAJOR OIL SPILL IS INEVITABLE UNLESS WE AND OFFSHORE DRILLING IT'S TIME TO PUT AN END TO THE USE OF THIS AGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND AID THE STATE IS TRANSITION TOWARDS MORE SUSTAINABLE RESOURCE PROCUREMENT WE HAVE AN APPROACH THAT WE BELIEVE IS FAIR TRANSPARENT AND WELL WE'LL AN OFFSHORE DRILLING IN STATE WATERS WITHIN TWO YEARS HERE'S WHAT OUR BILL WOULD DO FIRST IT REQUIRES THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION TO COMPLETE WITHIN ONE YEAR AN AMORTIZATION STUDY ASSESSING THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THESE LEASES INCLUDING BOTH THE ANTICIPATED PROFITS AND ALSO IMPORTANTLY THE COST OF CAPPING AND DECOMMISSIONING THESE REQS WE PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT DISCRETION LANDS COMMISSION TO CONDUCT THE STUDY AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT THEY WILL COME TO EXPLORE DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR DECOMMISSIONING AS PART OF THEIR STUDY SECOND OUR BILL WOULD DIRECT LANDS COMMISSION TO TRY TO NEGOTIATE A VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT WITH THE LEASEHOLDERS OPERATING STATE WATERS TO AN OIL PRODUCTION WITH COMPENSATION PROVIDED BASED ON THE FINDINGS OF THE AFFIRMATION AMORTIZATION STUDY THIS IS THE CORE PART OF OUR BILL WE ARE HOPING THAT LANCE COMMISSION AND THE OPERATORS CAN REACH A VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT AND WE GIVE THEM A TWO YEAR WINDOW UNTIL DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FOUR TO TRY TO REACH THAT AGREEMENT THIRD IF ANY GREEN IS NOT REACHED BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THIS BILL WOULD INSTRUCT LANDS COMMISSION TO TERMINATE THE LEASES FOR OIL PRODUCTION IN STATE WATERS AND PROVIDE JUST COMPENSATION TO THESE LEASE HOLDERS BASED ON THE FAIR MARKET VALUE AS DETERMINED BY THEIR IMMUNIZATION STUDY WE ARE TRYING TO PROVIDE LANDS COMMISSION WITH THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO COME TO A NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT AND THAT IS REALLY WHAT THE OUTCOME THAT WE'RE HOPING FOR NOW I ALSO WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THE IMPACT OF JOBS HAS TO BE A CORE PART OF THIS BILL THE HARD WORKING MEN AND WOMEN ON THESE RIGS DESERVE A FAIR TRANSITION AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO BE PART OF THIS PROCESS WERE OPEN TO WORKING WITH DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS TO TRY TO DEVELOP VARIOUS OPTIONS FOR THESE WORKERS I ALSO WANT TO THANK OPPOSITION WHICH HAS BEEN VERY OPEN TO WORKING WITH OUR OFFICE WE'VE HAD CLOSE AND CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING OPPOSITION WE BELIEVE THE BILL HAS MOVED INTERACTION HAS ADDRESSED MANY OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY OPPOSITION AND SHOULD THIS BILL MOVE OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY -- YOU HAVE MY WORD THAT WILL CONTINUE -- HAVING THESE DISCUSSIONS LOOKING TO TRY TO COME TO A PLACE WHERE WE ADDRESS THE REMAINING CONCERNS I ALSO WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THIS BILL IMPACTS JUST THREE OFF SHORE PLATFORMS EVA ANNIE AND ESTHER ALL OF WHICH CURRENTLY OPERATE OFF THE COAST OF ORANGE COUNTY THESE PLATFORMS WERE CONSTRUCTED BETWEEN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE AND NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE I ALSO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS BILL CREATES A FRAMEWORK THAT IS FRANKLY A MUCH BETTER DEAL FOR TAXPAYERS THAN THE STATUS QUO TOO MANY OF THE REMAINING LEASEHOLDERS HAVE A HEADS I WIN TAILS YOU LOSE SITUATION WHERE IF THERE'S A MAJOR OIL SPILL THEY DECLARE BANKRUPTCY THEY DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS TO PAY OFF THE COST TO TAXPAYERS IF THEY DRAINED THE LEASES DRY AND WALK AWAY AS WE SAW WITH PLATFORM HOLLY ARE THEY WALK AWAY DECLARE BANKRUPTCY AND LEAVE THE TAXPAYER HOLDING THEY'LL IN THE CASE OF PLATFORM HOLLY THAT BILL IS ESTIMATED TO BE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS I SO WHAT ARE BILL WOULD DO IS ACCOUNT FOR THE COSTS OF DECOMMISSIONING UP FRONT MAKE THAT PART OF THE FAIR MARKET VALUE I IN IS AGAIN A A GOOD DEAL FOR TAXPAYERS IT'S A FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE APPROACH NO MORE TORRANCE ARE NOT ENOUGH WE HAVE TO END THE DRILLING IF WE WANT TO STOP THIS BILLING AND WE WE SEE THIS IN STILL AFTER SPILL OUT THE EFFECTS ON WHO WE ARE CALIFORNIANS I WANT TO TELL BREE STORY BEFORE TURNING OVER MY WITNESSES I JUST ABOUT TWO YEARS AFTER I WAS BORN MY DAD WAS A DOCTOR IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING WAS DECIDING WHETHER TO ACCEPT A POSITION AN ACADEMIC POSITION IN THE MIDWEST OR TO JOIN LOCKHEED MARTIN HERE IN CALIFORNIA HE CAME OUT HERE INTERVIEWED AND THEN DECIDE TO DRIVE A FEW MINUTES THE COASTLINE HE BY HIMSELF A FISH SANDWICH TOOK OFF HIS SHOES AND SOCKS WALKED ALONG THE WATER ALONG THE SHORELINE WHILE EATING HIS DINNER AND THOUGHT HIMSELF THIS IS WHAT I WANT FOR MY LIFE AND THAT'S HOW I ENDED UP IN CALIFORNIA AS A YOUNG KID MY BROTHER MY FAMILY GOING UP HERE OF COUNTLESS CALIFORNIANS OUR COASTLINE IS WHO WE ARE AND IT'S WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR COASTLINE FROM THE CONSTANT SPECTER OF OIL SPILLS ARE BILL WOULD DO

A. COUNTY WE CAN TALK ABOUT CAUSES -- AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED THAT FATEFUL DAY OR MANY DAYS MAY HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE INCIDENCES THAT LED UP TO IT BUT WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A DUTY OF THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION AND FOR US AS LEGISLATORS TO LOOK AFTER THE PUBLIC TRUST HERE AND THAT THERE IS A LOT OF VALUE THAT IS CURRENTLY NOT ASSESSED IN THE THIS FORMULA WE USE WE USE FOR DETERMINING THE THE USEFULNESS OF MANY OF THESE ASSETS -- AND I APPRECIATE YOU TRYING TO TO WALK THE LINE ON THIS QUESTION OF AMORTIZATION THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS I KNOW THERE'S BEEN CONCERNS RAISED BY SOME OF THE FOLKS ON THE FENCE -- WHO ARE NECESSARILY IN OPPOSITION BUT WITH CONCERNS ABOUT -- JUST JUMPING THE GUN ON THE AMORTIZATION PROCESS AND AND LEADING STRAIGHT STRAIGHT INTO A TAKINGS ISSUE AND AS WELL AS THE THE NEED TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL THE COSTS AND AND BENEFITS WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT FAIR MARKET VALUE AS THE BILL NOTES -- IT IT DOESN'T REALLY GET INTO ALL THOSE DETAILS -- IN TERMS OF WHAT ARE THE WHAT ARE THOSE COSTS -- EVERYTHING FROM RISK OF FUTURE SPILLS -- COSTS BRING THE PLATFORMS AN ASSOCIATE IN INFRASTRUCTURE UP TO CURRENT STANDARDS ACOSTA SAYS YOU WITH ABANDONMENT REMOVAL AND REMEDIATION WE KNOW SOME OF THOSE ISSUES ARE OUTSTANDING AND THAT -- AND THAT OTHER OPPOSITION TO THE BILL HAVE HAVE FURTHER CONCERNS ABOUT JUST THE THE APPROACH I HAD TO GO THROUGH THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION IN THE FIRST PLACE HERE BUT I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE MOVING FORWARD AND THAT YOU HAVE WE HAVE TO KEEP THIS LEGISLATION MOVING -- AND THIS CONVERSATION GOING SO YOU KNOW THE WORK YOU'VE DONE WITH STAKEHOLDERS UP TO THIS POINT I THINK IS EVIDENCE OF YOUR YOUR WORK ETHIC BUT ALSO THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS ISSUE AND I APPRECIATE YOU NAVIGATING -- FROM THE YOU KNOW THE THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY WHO ARE WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE POLLUTER PAYS PRINCIPLE AND THAT WE DON'T WANT TO BE SUBSIDIZING IS REALLY THE RESPONSIBILITY INDUSTRY THAT'S PROFITED IN THE BILLIONS THAT'S JUST OFFSHORE BUT ON SHORE AS WELL SO FOR THIS COMMITTEE IT'S AN IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE THAT HERE TOO AND I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR RECOGNITION OF THAT TODAY AND GOING FORWARD AND WHAT WE DON'T HAVE TOTAL RESOLUTION ON THAT I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTING THE MEASURE TO TO GIVE YOU SOME SPACE TO TO KEEP WORKING -- THANKS ED HERTZBERG HAS A QUESTION COMMENT I DO HAVE A STRONG CUP SOME QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS THE FIRST QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE THEM WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE AND SECONDLY WHAT ARE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN TERMS OF FIXING THOSE SOLUTIONS CHAU NGUYEN FIRST OF ALL THIS TWENTY SEVEN OFFSHORE WELLS IN CALIFORNIA INTO WATERS IN IRAN CALIFORNIA TWENTY FOUR OF THEM ARE FEDERAL AND THREE OR STATES ARE CORRECT THERE'S TWENTY EIGHT WITH A FOR HIS PART PLATFORM HOLLY SO OKAY THE PLATFORM HOLLYWOOD WHICH IS SHUT DOWN THE PRESS RIGHT AT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE I DID A BILL ON THAT THAT WAS EXACTLY THE PROBLEM YOU'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH HERE DON'T TALK ABOUT SO NOW YOU WILL REALLY THE FOCUS OF THIS BILL IS THREE THREE OPTIONAL AS WELL AS WELL IF I MIGHT INTERJECT CENTER SURE WE WE ARE WE OBVIOUSLY CANNOT IMPACTED DIRECTLY OR I BELIEVE INDIRECTLY THAT RAKES IN FEDERAL WATERS CORRECT BUT WE ARE IN DISCUSSIONS OF COURSE WITH OUR CONGRESSIONAL COUNTERPARTS AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES IN FACT THAT WELL WE KNOW THEY'RE LOOKING AT THIS BILL AND WHETHER SUCCESSFUL AS AS POTENTIALLY A MODEL FOR FEDERAL LEGISLATION SO WE I'VE TALKED WITH KATIE PORTER MIKE LEVIN AND OTHER -- CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES REPRESENTING DIFFERENT PARTS THE ARE COUNTY COASTLINE KICK BUT THE REALITY IS IF IF THE RISK THAT WE'RE FACING BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT YOU'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO IS TO GET OFF OIL BUT IF IN FACT WE ARE JUST LOOKING AT THE AT THE FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE OF THIS BECAUSE I'M I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN TERMS OF COST BECAUSE IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET OFF OIL WHICH BUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S A SECONDARY REST THE CHAIRMAN TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE BEACHES WHICH YOU ALLUDED TO WITH RESPECT TO YOUR FATHER WALKING ON THE BEACH THAT IT HURTS THIS EXTRAORDINARY ASSETS SO IF YOU'VE GOT OIL AND YOU WANT TO GET OFF OIL NOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU REALLY ARE UNLESS YOU INCREASE PRODUCTION ON SHORE SO YOU'RE NOT AFFECTING THE SHORELINE RIGHT YOU ARE DEALING WITH TANKERS YOU'VE GOT THIS THIRTY PERCENT OF THE PARTICULAR MATTER IN THE HARBOR THAT WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT WITH ASTHMA AND ALL THESE OTHER KIDS AND ALL THE IMPACTS ARE COMING ON THOSE TANKERS RIGHT IS THAT A FAIR STATEMENT I'M NOT ABOUT RIGHT WHEN WAS I'M SORRY OKAY WE DID POINT IS IS THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING IS YOU'RE REPLACING ONE RISK WITH ANOTHER RISK IN TERMS OF IF YOU'RE IN FACT GOING TO IMPORT OIL OFF OF TANKERS THEN YOU'RE SAYING OKAY WE'RE TO MOVING THE BEACH RISK BUT WE'RE ADDING AIR POLLUTION RISK AS A CONSEQUENCE YOU FORGET IMPORTANT LIST WILL BE INCREASED DRILLING HERE NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO WHICH CONCERNS ME IN THE DISCUSSION I'VE HAD WITH YOU ALREADY AND I APPRECIATE YOUR EARNESTNESS WITH RESPECT TO THIS MEASURE BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A LONG TIME FOR THIS -- STRUCTURE YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY DEALING WITH THIS BILL WHICH CAUSED BY A TANKER NOT BY THE WAY WAS IT WAS IT A TANKER THAT DRAG DRAG THE THE AND THE AND THEN THE ALARMS DIDN'T GO OFF OR THEY MAY HAVE GONE OFF BUT DIDN'T ALERT THEM BECAUSE THEY PROBABLY WEREN'T UPDATED WHAT IS THE STATE WE'RE WE'RE HERE WOOD WORRIES ME AND I DEALT WITH THIS IN REGARDS TO REEFS RIGHT I KNOW THERE WAS SOME ISSUE ABOUT THAT WE PASS OF THE SENATE THREE TIMES WHERE WE SET UP ANIL WE ALIGNED INTERESTS IN A WAY AND I THINK THIS IS SENATOR HIMSELF WE'RE INNOCENT AND THOSE SPEAKER PEREZ DID THE SAME THING WE'RE TRYING TO ALIGN INTERESTS TO BE ABLE TO INCENTIVIZE THESE FOLKS TO ELIMINATE THESE OFFSHORE RIGS AND I KNOW THESE ARE AND SHALLOWER WATERS IN TERMS OF RIGS TO REEFS BUT RIGHT NOW YOU'RE EXPOSED TO THIS EXTRAORDINARY TAXPAYER EXPENSE AND MONEY'S NOT PRINTED ON TREES SO YOU'RE SAYING WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS MONEY OUT OF FOSTER CARE -- WE'RE GOING TO TAKE IT OUT OF MONEY THAT WE NEED TO BUILD HOUSING FOR HOMELESS WE IN GOVERNMENT HAVE AN OBLIGATION AS WE SPEND TAX DOLLARS TO BALANCE IT'S EASY JUST TO SAY YES TO EVERYBODY ALL THE TIME AND NOT BE RESPONSIBLE IN GOVERNMENT WHICH IS OUR JOB WHERE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO COST WE KNOW THAT IF IF WE TAKE THESE THEY'RE CLEARLY IN THE LAW THIS IS A TAKING AND THE QUESTION IS I LOOK AT THIS AND QUITE FRANKLY AND AS I ANALYZED AFTER TALKING TO YOU AND TRYING TO GIVE YOU THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT AND BEATING THE ANALYSIS IS TO SAY OKAY WHY DON'T WE JUST DO ONE OFF EACH ONE OF THESE WHY CAN'T WE DO TRADE OFFS IN TERMS OF NEGOTIATING EACH ONE YOU SET UP THIS WHOLE PROCESS WITHIN THE BUREAUCRACY OF GOVERNMENT THEN TIES YOU TO THIS FRAMEWORK WHERE YOU COULD BASICALLY DOES THIS ONE OF THESE COMPANIES WHAT AMY ESTHER ME WHATEVER THE THREE PLATFORMS ARE CALLED DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO NEGOTIATE WHERE WHERE ONE OF THESE COMPANIES I DON'T HOLD THESE THINGS HAVE NO CLUE BUT OFTEN THE GO SHAKE SOMETHING WITH THEM TO REDUCE THE RISK ON THE GENERAL FUND THAT AFFECTS PEOPLE I I THINK THAT YOU PROBABLY COULD BUT NOW WHAT'S HAPPENED IS YOU'VE SET UP THIS PROCESS AND I UNDERSTAND SO WORK IN PROGRESS AND I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS MANY TIMES BUT WHEN I LOOK AT THE BASIC FRAMEWORK YOU'RE SAYING TO ME IN THAT TO ASKING FOR FOR ME TO SUPPORT THIS THAT YOU KNOW YES OKAY FINE WE WANT TO DO ALL THIS GREAT WE WANT TO GET THIS DONE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AGREE AGREE AGREE NO QUESTION BUT YOU'RE NOT BALANCING IT AGAINST ONE OF THE OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ALL THE OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH GOVERNMENT AND THEN YOU'RE SETTING UP THIS FRAMEWORK WITH THE CALIFORNIA LANDS COMMISSION I WORKED WITH MANY MANY YEARS ON A NUMBER OF THINGS AND IT IT IS QUITE PROBLEMATIC AND SO I I JUST I GOTTA TELL YOU FROM MY PERSPECTIVE DO YOU KNOW UNLESS YOU'RE BASICALLY SPENDING ALL THIS MONEY TO BEG ELIMINATE OIL COMPLETELY YOU'RE NOT REALLY SOLVING THE PROBLEM IN YOUR CREATING A WHOLE HOST OF NEW PROBLEMS I'D LIKE TO GET SOME OF INSIGHT YOU HAVE A BRIGHT FELLA ON SOME OF THE STUFF BUT I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S THE SAME THING HAPPENS IN THIS JOB ALL THE TIME PEOPLE COME IN ON ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER SIDE AND THEY WANT TO YOU KNOW HAVE SOME POLITICAL THING THAT HAPPENED THEIR COMMUNITY AND THEY WANT TO MAKE A STATEMENT BUT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO DEAL WITH THIS IN A REALLY INTELLIGENT WAY AND THAT MEANS SPENDING ARE THE TAXPAYERS DOLLARS IN THE WAY MOST EXPEDITIOUSLY AND IF YOU'RE OUT HERE TO STAY YOU'RE GOING TO ELIMINATE OIL WHAT ARE YOU REALLY DOING THAT HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING ELSE IN TERMS THAT CONSEQUENCE RIGHT AND WHAT PRICE TO PAY AND ARE YOU PUTTING YOURSELF IN A FRAMEWORK THAT IS SO RIGID THAT YOU'RE BASICALLY SETTING A TONE THAT PUTS US IN A VERY DIFFICULT POSITION TO NEGOTIATE BECAUSE I KNOW YOU MENTIONED THE BIG STORY THING WHERE THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES TO LOOK AT THIS THING IN A DIFFERENT WAY BUT I I'D LIKE TO GET SOME OF YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS BECAUSE I'M HAVING TROUBLE IT IN TERMS OF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR OBJECTIVE IS YEAH WITHOUT SEEING ALL OF THE HORRIBLE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND NOT REALLY GETTING TO THE ROOT OF SOLVING THE PROBLEM YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE THANK YOU CENTER AT THANK YOU OF COURSE PLEASE SOME MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL AND MAYBE THAT IS I WASN'T COMMUNICATING CLEARLY I THINK YOU ARE NOT HERE IN FORCING FOR MY OPENING STATEMENT OKAY BUT THE POINT IS BILLS NOT TO GET RID OIL WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE GET THE STATE OFF WHERE THAT THAT'S A SECONDARY RIGHT THAT'S THE SUBJECT OF A WHOLE DIFFERENT DEBATE THIS THIS IS A NARROWER GOAL WHICH IS IS ABOUT BALANCING AS YOU SAID BALANCING THE RISKS OF OFFSHORE OIL SPILLS THAT JEOPARDIZE OUR COASTLINE AND R. FORTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR ECONOMY IT AND THAT'S A REAL RISK AND WE'VE SEEN IT TIME AFTER TIME AND YES SOME OF THAT RISK IS AGGREGATED IN THE TANKERS A LOT OF IT THOUGH COMES FROM THE PLATFORMS AND IN THIS CASE IT WAS OIL FROM PLATFORM IT WAS A SHIP I I BELIEVE IT WAS IN THE TANKER WAS A CARGO SHIP IT MAY HAVE BEEN A TANKER BUT EITHER WAY IT WAS ABOUT AN EXPOSE PIPELINE IT WAS ABOUT AN ALARM THAT ALLEGEDLY WENT OFF BUT NOBODY ANSWERED IT AND AND THAT SEEMS LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN A CASE OF NON INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS ALL TOO COMMON WITH THESE THINGS AND I THINK IN TALKING TO THE SENATE AND I APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THE RIG THREE FINAL YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT THIS ISSUE -- BUT YOU ALSO KNOW THEN THAT A LOT OF THIS INFRASTRUCTURE IS OLD IF THERE'S NO MEANINGFUL INCENTIVES FOR THE EXISTING OPERATORS WHO ARE YOU KNOW -- TWO OR THREE GENERATIONS DOWN OTHER THE MAJORS ARE ALL OUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE INCENTIVES TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE INCENTIVES IS ABOUT RISKS AND BALANCING THOSE RISKS I THINK THIS FRAMEWORK DOES COME TO THAT BUT THIS IS NOT ABOUT TRYING TO GET RID OF OIL IT'S ABOUT BALANCING THE RISKS OF SPILLS FROM THESE WHAT I THINK ARE TICKING TIME BOMBS AND I THINK PEOPLE STUDY THIS AGREE WITH THAT -- AND AND THE REST SAY POSTCARDS ARE SHORT IN OUR OUR BEACHES AND I REALLY DO THINK THAT UNLESS WE STOP THE DRILLING WE WILL END UP INEVITABLY HAVING ANOTHER MAJOR MAJOR OIL SPILL WHETHER IT'S IN A YEAR TEN YEARS TWENTY YEARS WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO SEE THAT HAPPEN -- UNSERE IS NUMBER APPOINT SOMEONE TO GO THROUGH THEM -- THE COSTS -- AND I SHOULD ALSO SAY THIS IS NOT ON FOR DRILLING OIL PRODUCTION THIS BILL IS LIMITED TO THE THREE PLATFORMS WITH THE HOPE OF PROVIDING EXAMPLE FOR THE OTHER TWENTY FOUR PLATFORMS IN FEDERAL WATERS THEN AGAIN I KNOW THAT OUR CONGRESSIONAL COUNTERPARTS ARE BIT CLICK VERY CLOSELY FOLLOWING WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW WITH THIS BILL -- THEY MAY USE THIS IS A MODEL THEY MAY NOT BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT DEPENDS ON WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS BILL ON THIS COMMITTEE AND GOING FORWARD -- YOU KNOW THE COST OF THIS BILL WE THINK WILL BE CONSTRAINED IN AGAIN I EMPHASIZE THE POINT THAT THIS THIS FRAMEWORK ACTUALLY INCORPORATES THE UP UP FRONT THE COST OF DECOMMISSIONING IN A WAY THAT I THINK IS A BETTER DEAL TO TAXPAYERS THAN THE ALTERNATIVE WE SAW THIS WITH PLATFORM HOLLY UNFORTUNATELY WHERE THE COST OF DECOMMISSIONING SHOULD HAVE BEEN PAID FOR BY THE OPERATOR I THEY DECLARE BANKRUPTCY AND LEFT US HOLDING BACK AND I THINK UNFORTUNATELY THE THE MOST THE COMPANIES HOLDING THESE AYE SO DITE DE CORPORATE DIE CORP WHICH I BELIEVE IS HOUSTON BASED COMPANY ALSO LEASES AND OPERATES TO THE PLATFORMS OF THE THREE WERE TALKING AT THE OTHERS OPERATED BY C. R. C. AND -- YOU KNOW MY BELIEF IS THAT IF WE HAVE ANOTHER MAJOR OIL SPILL OR WE HAVE ANOTHER MAJOR A SET OF DECOMMISSIONING COSTS WE WE MAY FACE THAT SAME DILEMMA OF A COMPANY WALKING WAY DECLARING BANKRUPTCY AND LEAVING TAXPAYERS HOLDING THE BAG SO AT LEAST THIS APPROACH -- INCORPORATES UP FRONT THE COST OF DECOMMISSIONING IT GETS RID OF THE RISKS OF OFFSHORE SPILLS FROM THESE RIGS AGAIN I KNOW THERE ARE OTHER WAYS IN WHICH OFFERS BILLS CAN HAPPEN BUT IT DOES REMOVE THAT RISK AND WE THINK THAT IT DOESN'T LINE IN SENTENCE IN THAT IT PROVIDES THE POWER AND TOOLS FOR PLANTS TO BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE A SETTLEMENT THAT'S WITH THE GOAL OF THIS FRAMEWORK YOU CAN'T NEGOTIATE A SETTLEMENT WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT THE FAIR MARKET VALUES I'M NOT GOING TO GO IN AND DID ON YOU KNOW SOMETHING ON EBAY WITHOUT HAVING SOME SENSE OF THE CONDITION OF THAT WHAT IT'S WORTH I WOULD THAT'S WHAT REALLY AUTHORIZING LANDS COMMISSION TO DO WE DO ANTICIPATE THERE WILL BE AN APPROPRIATION FOR THIS AND TRYING TO COME TO A FAIR DEAL AND AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS IS ABOUT THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION WITH STEP UP ABOUT WHETHER IT'S APPROPRIATE TO HAVE A TERMINATION CLAUSE WE FEEL LIKE THEY NEED THAT NEGOTIATING POWER TO BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE A FAIR DEAL BUT IT'S SOMETHING WE'LL CONTINUE TO DISCUSS WITH CHIP -- WISPA I AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS SHOULD THIS BILL NEVADA COMMITTEE TODAY IT WE WANT TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK AND ROBUST SET OF TOOLS FOR INDIGO SHOULD HAPPEN THAT'S OBVIOUSLY IN EVERYONE'S INTERESTS ARE BECAUSE THE WRISTLET ADDITION ARE THERE THE CONSULATE ADDITION COULD BE HIGH AND WE LIKE TO TRY TO AVOID THAT BUT WE DO THINK THE COSTS WILL BE MORE MANAGEABLE THAN SOME HAVE PREDICTED -- WE DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S NOT MUCH OIL LEFT IN THESE THREE PLATFORMS I HAVE BACK OF THE ENVELOPE NUMBERS FROM ONE OF THE PLATFORMS I'M HAPPY TO TALK WITH YOU OFFLINE ABOUT THOSE -- BUT WE DO WE DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE IN THE BILLIONS WE THINK IT'S GOING TO BE -- YOU KNOW SOMETHING MUCH LESS THAN AND I DON'T WANT TO THE RIGHT NUMBERS BUT BUT WE THINK IT'S MANAGEABLE AND IN THE CONTEXT AGAIN -- FORTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL COASTAL KANEMI WE THINK THAT THIS BILL IS A PARTICULARLY FACTOR IN DECOMMISSIONING COSTS IS ACTUALLY GOOD DEAL FOR TAXPAYERS AT A TIME WE HAVE A RECORD SURPLUS IT'S NOT ABOUT MONEY GROWING ON TREES IT'S ABOUT MANAGING LONG TERM RISK AND AND TRYING TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT BECAUSE I I THINK WE ALL KNOW OIL SPILLS ARE DEVASTATING IN MY DISTRICT ALONG WITH SEVEN DAYS OF SHUT DOWN BEACHES THE CONCERT ANY PRETTY PRETTY HIGH FROM THAT IF THEY HAD BEEN AS SEVERE AS REFUGIO WHERE THE BEACHES WERE SHUT DOWN FOR SIX MONTHS I HAVEN'T SEEN A STUDY OF ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THAT BUT SIX MONTHS OF SHUT DOWN BEACHES AND PLACES LIKE WE'RE GOING TO NEWPORT AND HUNTINGTON I'M GONNA HAVE MASSIVE COST AS YOU KNOW THE HUNTING THE HUNTING BEACH OIL SPILL SHUT DOWN THE SECOND DAY OF THE AIR SHOW WE HAD A MILLION A HALF THE TOURISTS IN TOWN THEY WERE GONNA GO OUT TO BARS GONNA GO OUT BE ON THE BEACH ARE THEY ALL WENT HOME INSTEAD AND SO I TALKED TO NUMEROUS SHOP OWNERS WHO ESTIMATED THE LOSS YOU KNOW A HUGE DAY OF REVENUES BECAUSE THAT THEN THE WEEK FOLLOWING -- WHEN THERE'S NO REVENUE -- THEY THEY SUFFERED AS WELL I ONE SHOP OWNER TOLD ME SHE LOST ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF HER MONTHLY INCOME ON AGAIN IT COULD'VE BEEN MUCH MUCH WORSE IF IF THIS BILL HAD BEEN AS BAD AS EXPECTED SO -- CONNECTIONS ONE FOLLOW YEAH AND OKAY GOOD YEAH I JUST AMEND LISTENING TO YOU IF YOU'RE TELLING US THAT MAHOOD PURPOSE SO CONCERNED IF YOUR PURPOSE IS NOT TO GET RID OF OIL IF THAT'S WHAT YOUR PURPOSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU'VE SET UP A STRUCTURE THAT BASICALLY PUTS THE TAXPAYER INCH IN THE JACKPOT OKAY AND HERE'S THE REASON WHY IF I DON'T KNOW WHO THESE COMPANIES ARE OF THE OF ON SHORE OIL BUT BEFORE EITHER GONNA STOP GETTING AWFUL FOR NOT THEN WE'VE GOT TWO OPTIONS PUMP MORE FROM CALIFORNIA I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND THAT'S GIVING YOU A HYPOTHETICAL AGAINST PROFESSOR AND THEN THE SECOND THING IS WE CAN IMPORT THOSE ARE ONLY TWO OPTIONS OKAY BRING IT FROM OVER THERE AND ALL THE VARIOUS ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUNKER FUEL AND ALL THOSE PROBLEMS BUT THE WHOLE YOU'RE THINKING OF IS NOT TO GET RID OF OIL YOU'VE LIMITED YOUR SKILL YOUR ABILITY TO GET SOMETHING DONE BECAUSE IF YOUR PURPOSE IS TO PROTECT THE BEACH LEGIT LEGIT LEGIT OKAY BUT YOU CAN GO AND WORK OUT WITH THESE COMPANIES IS YOU'VE GOT TO PAY BASIC RESEARCHER MISSING ONE INSTEAD OF PUTTING THE TAXPAYERS AND JUG JEOPARDY YOU CAN GO TO THIS COMPANIES SAY YOU'RE MAKING FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ON THIS PROJECT WE'LL GIVE YOU A RESOURCE OVER HERE TO MAKE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR BUT YOU'RE LIMITING THAT THAT'S NOT HAPPENING AS OF AS AN OPTION SECOND THING YOU'RE DOING YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IF THAT COMPANY FILES B.

ONE IS GOING TO STOP BEING A WORK IN PROGRESS AND WHAT ARE THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WILL GET YOU THERE RENT AND WHO WITH THAT AND WHERE DO YOU THINK YOUR PATH IS IF IF YOU MOVE THIS BILL OUT OF COMMITTEE SURE AND I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION SENATOR FIRST OF ALL ON THE LIABILITY TAXPAYERS WHICH IS SOMETHING WE'D BE HAPPY TO DISCUSS WITH YOU GOING FORWARD AND AND TO THINK ABOUT SOME OF THE MECHANISMS THAT SENATOR HERTZBERG AYE HAS RAISED AS YOU POINT OUT THESE ARE UNLIKELY CANDIDATES FOR EXTRA REEF OUT WE DO ANTICIPATE THAT LANDS COMMISSION IN H. FOR THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD -- IN CONDUCTING AMORTIZATION STUDY WOULD SS AND EXPLORE ALL DIFFERENT AVENUES FOR THE USE OF THESE REEFS ERROR THESE USE -- PLATFORMS AND -- THAT IS SOMETHING WE HOPE IS PART OF THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS IS COULD THIS BE USED FOR ALTERNATIVE USES AND AND DOES THAT CHANGE THE CALCULUS AS FAR AS THE COST OF DECOMMISSIONING TO THE TAXPAYER OR OTHERWISE -- AS FAR AS OUR PATHWAY FORWARD OBVIOUSLY WE ARE ENGAGED WITH BOTH OUR SUPPORTERS IN OPPOSITION WE FEEL LIKE THIS BILLS ALREADY MOVED A LONG WAY WITH SOME OF OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH OPPOSITION AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OTHER REPRESENTATIVE FROM SEEP UP MENTION THAT AT THIS POINT THEY'RE ONLY OPPOSED TO THE TERMINATION CLAUSE THAT BEING SAID EVEN IF WE GET TO A POINT WHERE WE AN AGREEMENT WITH SOME OF THE OPPOSITION THERE THERE'S SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU AND SENATOR HERTZBERG HAVE RAISED ABOUT MAKING SURE THIS IS THIS WE RESPONSIBLE FOR TAXPAYERS I IS THAT SOMETHING WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAFF OF COMMITTEES MOVING FORWARD THIS STAFF YOUR STAFF IN YOURSELF IF YOU IF YOU TO BE SO INCLINED LANDS COMMISSION AND OTHER FOLKS INVOLVED WITH THIS THEY'LL BE MINISTERING THIS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE BEST PATHWAY FORWARD THAT PROTECTS TAXPAYERS GETS TO OUR GOAL OF ENDING THESE PLATFORMS IN A WAY THAT IS FAIR TRANSPARENT AND -- MINIMIZES LITIGATION RISK THEN HAPPY TO DO IT I WISH I STILL HAD TO STAFF RESOURCES BECAUSE THEY'D BE THE ONES THAT WOULD BE BEST TO ENGAGE WITH YOU UP ON THIS BUT THE ARE ME THAT YOU DO THE DRESSES ISSUES IF THIS MOVES ALONG AN ENDED AND I A I NOTED THAT THE THAT THERE WAS SORT OF A MOVE TO NEUTRALITY ON ONE PART OF THE BILL OR AT LEAST SOME MEASURE OF ACCEPTANCE SAID AND THE THING THAT WE HAVE OUTLINED IS THE REMAINING THING WHERE THERE'S STILL SOME CONCERN AND AND I THINK ONE OF THE HARDEST ISSUES ARE ALWAYS IT IS THE ISSUE OF LIMITING MORAL PRODUCTION HERE AND THE OPTIONS OF TANKERS OR OIL TRAINS OR OTHER THINGS THAT THAT ARE REALLY GOOD IT'S A QUESTION OF WHICH WAY ARE WE GOING TO TAKE ARE POISONED AND SO ARE I AM INCLINED TO MOVE THIS BILL ALONG AND GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO CONTINUE TO WORK BUT I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU COULD FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET TO THE END SOONER RATHER THAN LATER WE'RE WE'RE TRYING AND I I DO I WILL SAY I THINK WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN RECENT DAYS AND WEEKS -- AND AGAIN I I KNOW THAT THE AMOUNT OF WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IS IS I DON'T ASSIST AMENDMENTS BUT IT'S A VERY SMALL FRACTION OF CALIFORNIA OIL PRODUCTION AND U. S. OIL PRODUCTION WE TALK ABOUT THREE PLATFORMS IT FAIRLY SHALLOW WATERS ANY AND ALL OFFSHORE PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA OFF THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA ACCOUNTS FOR LESS THAN POINT THREE PERCENT OF U. S. OIL PRODUCTION -- SO I DON'T THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WITH THESE THREE PLATFORMS ARE SHIFTING TO LIKE A MASSIVE CHANGE AND SUBSTITUTES OF PRODUCTS YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VERY SMALL DROP OF WITH THEIR SMALL DROP IN THE BUCKET BUT WE HAVE SEEN MISTER CHAIR WITH YOUR INDULGENCE WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE -- -- IN THE PLATFORM THAT SENATOR HERTZBERG A REFERENCE JUST HOW ONE CAN GO TO FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN LIABILITY YEAH AND WE IN OUR DISCUSSION LAST WEEK ON THE BONDING VERSUS OTHER ALTERNATIVES WE'VE SEEN WHAT THE LIABILITY TO THE STATE IS THAT IS REALLY BIG YEAH WITH THE EXISTING WELLS BEFORE WE EVEN MOVED TO SOMEWHERE ELSE SO THESE ARE REAL ISSUES THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE IF I MIGHT REPLY JUST REAL QUICK PLEASE YOU KNOW BUT YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO TAKE THESE THINGS THAT IT MAYBE WITH A GRAIN OF SALT BUT I DO BELIEVE THEY'VE LEARNED A LOT FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF THE COMMISSION HOLLY AND THEY THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE GOT A BETTER GRASP ON THE COST OF DECOMMISSIONING THE PROCESS AND WE ACTUALLY SAW SIMILAR ANALOG HERE WITH THE RESPONSE THAT WAS BILLS -- THAT THAT THAT WHAT WE SAW WITH OSCAR AND COMMAND CENTER IN HUNTINGTON BEACH OIL SPILL WAS WAS TRULY AMAZING I THAT COORDINATE A RESPONSE I THINK WAS THE RESULT OF LEARNED EXPERIENCE OF REALLY BUILDING ON THE LESSONS OF THE PAST AND LANCE COMMISSION IT SURE'S US THAT THEY HAVE LEARNED A LOT THEY HAVE A BETTER HANDLE ON HOW TO VALUE THIS AND ESTIMATED FOR EXAMPLE THAT PLATFORM ANY I BELIEVE IS IS GOING TO HAVE A DECOMMISSIONING COSTS ALL IN ABOUT NINETY TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF THE BALLPARK FIGURES WERE TALKING ABOUT NOW I'M NOT SAYING THAT ALL THREE PLATFORMS OF THE SAME BUT THEY CAN'T REALLY START THAT DECOMMISSIONING PROCESS ON ALL THREE PLATFORMS OR THE THE SETTLEMENT WITHOUT SOME KIND OF AUTHORIZATION WHICH IS WHAT OUR BILL AIMS TO DO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WOULD MOST OF THEM OKAY MOTION FOR CENTER LAYERED CENTER EGGMAN THANK YOU -- I THINK I'M ELEMENT SET UP WHO DOES NOT REPRESENT A COASTAL COMMUNITY SO THAT PUSHED ME TO A DIFFERENT POSITIONS AND AND MORE DEPENDENT UPON MY PEERS AND THEIR EXPERIENCE AND SO I RESPECT EVERYBODY BUT PEOPLE OF SAID -- THAT THIS INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED ISSUE WITH A HUGE LIABILITY POTENTIALLY TO THE TAXPAYERS -- AND A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT SHIFTING RISK FROM COASTLINES TO INTERCITY PORTS WHICH YOU KNOW WE KNOW WHO LIVES THERE AND THE THOSE COMMUNITIES SO I I HAVE I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE COST I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE SHALL DETERMINATION -- AND I HAVE CONCERNS THAT THERE ARE THAT THAT WE ARE WE ARE GIVING OVER BUREAUCRACY AND MY EXPERIENCES BUREAUCRACIES DON'T SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT THE STRUCTURE IN WHICH TO DO THAT THAT'S MORE FLEXIBLE AND PROVIDES FOR -- VARIATION BETWEEN THOSE THREE WELLS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT JUST ONE ONE THING AND WE'RE WE'RE DOING ONE BILL FOR THREE WELLS SO I WILK SUPPORTED TODAY I BUT I WILL NOT CONTINUE TO SUPPORT IT IF WE DON'T RESOLVE THE ISSUES THAT I THINK ARE VERY REAL IN FRONT OF US THANKS FOR THE COMMENT -- WE DO HAVE A MOTION FROM CENTER LAYERED A CEREMONY OF A COMMENT QUITE WELL AND I'LL JUST COMMENT AND INPUT FROM HOLLY HAS COME UP MULTIPLE TIMES I THINK PEOPLE KNOW THAT'S IN THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT -- AND SURELY THIS IS AN ONGOING DISCUSSION AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEE THESE DISCUSSIONS COME UP IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE I I I DO THINK THAT THE CONSTITUENCIES WILL REPRESENT IS A SHIFT IN HOW WE THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW WHERE WE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE ON THE RISKS AND THAT AND THAT THIS BILL IS IN LINE WITH WHERE AT YOU KNOW CONSTITUENTS FEEL IN MY DISTRICT THINK LOOKING AT THE ANALYSIS WE YOU AND I HAD MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS AND ABOUT THIS ISSUE OVER ALL -- BUT IN MY FEELING IS IS THAT THIS IS A BILL THAT'S IN THE FIRST COMMITTEE IF YOU KNOW IF I HAD TO GUESS I THINK IT'S GONNA BE A WORK IN PROGRESS ALL THE WAY THROUGH BECAUSE THESE ARE VERY HARD ISSUES WE DON'T KNOW WHERE WE LAND UNTIL THE END -- AND IT'S REALLY THE FEEDBACK THE ANALYSIS AT THE BACK AND FORTH OF LEGISLATIVE INPUT AND INSIGHT AND OVERSIGHT AT THAT KIND OF GETS PUT INTO THIS BILL THAT WILL HELP US -- WHERE IS THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION WAS WHERE THEY'RE AT NOW IN TERMS OF THEIR UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THESE PLATFORMS -- AND THAT WITH THE WELLS OVERALL IT IS A THINK DIFFERENT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK A LOT OF EVOLVEMENT EXPERTISE AT AND ABILITY TO COME IN -- AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT I'M GRATEFUL BECAUSE AS I SPEAK RIGHT THERE COME INTO THE DISTRICT TO DO A TOUR WITH CONSTITUENTS WITH THE PUBLIC ABOUT ONE OF THE WEALTHY AND YOU'RE SMILING BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS RIGHT IT'S AN UNDERSTANDING OF TRYING TO TALK TO THE YOU KNOW PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA OF WHAT THIS WHAT THE TRADE OFFS ARE AND ALSO HAVE THEM SEE -- FIRST HAND -- WHERE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES ARE SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS -- AND ALSO I'M GRATEFUL FOR FOR COLLEAGUES TO ALLOW THE CONVERSATION TO KEEP GOING THIS IS GOING TO KEEP COMING UP AND UNLESS YOU KNOW MY FEAR IS IT WHAT'S STOPPING THIS CONVERSATION SO EARLY WE DON'T GET TO THE PROCESS OF A LEGISLATIVE INSIGHT OVERSIGHT THAT I THINK IS REALLY NEEDED IT TO CRAFT AT THE END PRODUCTS SO -- I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS IS WELL AND LOOK FORWARD TO AND I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS AND HAVE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS THANK YOU CENTER THANK YOU CEREMONY WE DO HAVE A MOTION BEFORE US ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE AFTER VERY ROBUST DISCUSSION APPRECIATE ALL THE THE -- DIRECTIVES AND WATCHFULNESS THIS COMMITTEE AND I'LL I'LL JUST REITERATE AGAIN IT THE HARD WORK BUT AS YOU GO FORWARD BEFORE THE FLOOR WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT ALL THE ISSUES RAISED HERE -- THE TRUE COSTS OF THESE PLATFORMS AND OF THIS INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING COST THE PUBLIC -- WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHATEVER THE MARKET VALUE OR THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THESE ASSETS ARE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T HIDE THOSE COSTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE IMPOSED ON ON THE PUBLIC ON OUR NATURAL RESOURCES I KNOW YOU'LL BE WATCHFUL THAT GOING FORWARD SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR WORK TO CLOSE YOU TO MY COLLEAGUES THANK YOU TO THE COMMENTERS FOR A VERY ROBUST CONVERSATION I I DO APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK AND AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK AND I THINK IF YOU SAW THE VERY FIRST ITERATION THIS BILL YOU SEEN IT'S IT'S MOVED A LOT SINCE THEN I WILL CONTINUE TO TRY TO MODIFY THIS BILL AND AND BE FLEXIBLE ON IT SO THAT IT ADDRESSES THE CONCERNS RAISED TODAY ABOUT RISKS ABOUT LIABILITY AND SOME OF THE OTHER COMMENTS -- REYES SO -- YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT THAT WILL KEEP WORKING WE'LL KEEP WORKING WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS -- AND SEE WHAT WE CAN COME UP WITH AN AND -- I CAN'T PROMISE YOU THIS BILL WILL GET ALL THE WAY FOR WILL BUT WE'LL TRY OUR BEST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS THAT I CAN HOPEFULLY EARN YOUR SUPPORT I TODAY AND ALSO GOING FORWARD SO I

C. U. S. THIS IS A SENTIMENT SHARED WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE PRESIDENT BIDEN'S AMBITIOUS DOMESTIC CLIMATE GOAL OF NET ZERO EMISSIONS ECONOMY WIDE BY TWENTY FIFTY THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION PROJECTS THE NEED TO CAPTURE TRANSPORT AND PERMANENTLY SEQUESTER SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES OF CARBON DIOXIDE THERE IS A REAL TIME BENEFIT TO SEE COS THAT PROVIDES IT ENVIRONMENTALLY THE PROCESS CAPTURE CAPTURES CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS STRAIGHT FROM THE SOURCE TO AVOID RELEASED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE IN FACT CARBON CAPTURE METHOD SEQUESTER MORE THAN NINETY PERCENT OF CO TWO EMISSIONS FROM POWER POWER PLANTS AND INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES NINETY PERCENT OF WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE RELEASED THIS IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TOOL AND A PRACTICAL METHOD ESTIMATES ALSO INDICATE APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE STATE'S TOTAL CO TWO EMISSIONS CAN BE CAPTURED AND STORED WITH C. C. U. S. C. C. U. S. HAS BENEFITS ENVIRONMENTALLY BUT ALSO FOR OUR WORK FORCE AND OVERALL ECONOMY THE USE OF C. C. U. S. WOULD ENABLE DIFFICULT TO DECARBONISE INDUSTRIES TO STAY IN BUSINESS AND CONTINUE TO MAKE LARGE CONTRIBUTIONS TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY WHILE DRAMATICALLY REDUCING THEIR GHG EMISSIONS C. C. U. S. ACTIVITIES WOULD ALSO PROVIDE GOOD PAYING JOBS FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH SKILL SETS THAT WE NEED TO SUPPORT AS WE MAKE IT CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION ALSO CONSIDER THAT MANY ORGANIZATIONS AND COMMERCIALIZE SECTORS ARE READILY ABLE TO SUPPLY C.

C. U. S.

C. U. S. REGULATIONS WILL ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA IS WORKING WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS IN AN EFFICIENT AND LOGICAL FASHION WE ALSO DISCUSSED THE -- LIABILITY ISSUES AS WELL AS THE NEED FOR THERE TO BE -- LIABILITY -- INDEFINITELY INTO THE FUTURE AND THAT OBVIOUSLY WE START TALKING ABOUT POOR SPACE CALIFORNIA COULD BECOME A GLOBAL LEADER IN C. C. U. S. DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT TO ACHIEVE ITS CLIMATE GOALS AS IT HAS IN OTHER CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES BUT TO DO SO IT NEEDS TO ACT AND ACT COMPREHENSIVELY BY SUPPORTING MEASURES THAT ENDEAVOR TO UTILIZE C.

WORKING ON THE DETAILS -- WE'RE WORKING WITH -- THE WORKING GROUP THAT THEIR LEADERSHIP HAS PUT TOGETHER -- WHICH IS ABLY CHAIRED BY SENATOR LAYERED HE'S DONE AT A TREMENDOUS JOB AT KEEPING OUR NOSE TO THE GRINDSTONE -- AND IT IS MY ANTICIPATION AND -- CENTERING THEM YOUR MOM CAN -- CAN AGREE OR NOT I THINK WE BOTH WANT THIS TO BE RESOLVED BY THE TIME WE GET TO THE FLOOR ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AND THAT WILL HAVE A PACKAGE THAT WILL HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF ELEMENTS IN IT THAT WILL -- REALLY PROVIDE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE THINK ARE REALLY IMPORTANT BOTH IN TERMS OF -- AT PRODUCING ENERGY WHICH WHICH WHICH WE DEFINITELY NEED TO DO WE NEED A GRADE THAT IS RELIABLE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT STARTS TO -- MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS BECAUSE WE DON'T DO CARBON CAPTURE EVERY BUDDY SAYS WE CAN'T GET THERE WE HAVE VERY AMBITIOUS GOALS WE CAN'T GET THERE AND AS WE START TO GET THERE I'D LIKE TO THINK WE CAN ALSO CLEAN UP OUR POLLUTED AIR A LOT OF IT WHICH RESIDES IN MY DISTRICT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND SO SO IT IT WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH A WHOLE BUNCH OF GOALS HERE AND -- IT'S IT'S A DELICATE THREAD AND -- WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU IS THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE AS WE -- NARROW NARROW THE BILL'S DOWN TO REALLY FOCUS ON ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE SO I YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT TO TAKE ALL ALL OF THE AMENDMENTS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THAT ONE AND WE'RE WORKING ON IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- EARLIER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I DID SAY WHAT I WANT A LOT OF WHAT I WANT TO SAY ON THE PREVIOUS BILL THE END DUE TO GO ON -- AND I APPRECIATE THE EXCHANGE WITH THE CHAIR AND AND THE AUTHOR MR HANNAN'S COMMENTS -- -- FOR -- FOR ONE REASON AND THAT IS IS THAT I APPRECIATED HIM TALKING ABOUT COMMITMENTS TO GOALS AND THE FACT THAT HE'S COMMITTED I APPRECIATED HIS MENTION OF OFFSHORE WIND BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS ANOTHER PLACE THAT WE CAN FIND UNITY I KNOW CENTER MCGUIRE AND I HAVE THE TWO LARGE PROPOSALS THAT ARE OFF OF OUR DISTRICTS AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO MOVING AHEAD AND WORKING OUT THAT FIREMEN WISHES AND THE PLANNING ISSUES AND AND TRYING TO DO IT EXPEDITIOUSLY AND THAT IS THE THEME THAT IS BEHIND THE DISCUSSION ON THIS BILL AND THE PREVIOUS ONE WHICH IS WE ARE TRYING TO WORK THINGS OUT SO WE CAN MOVE AHEAD AND WHILE I MIGHT OF EXPRESSES IT IN THE DISCUSSION OF THE PREVIOUS BILL SOME PROBLEMS I MIGHT HAVE PERSONALLY ON THIS ISSUE THAT WERE REFLECTED BY SOME OF THE OPPOSITION COMMENTS IT IS MORE IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW THAT WE TRY TO MOVE AHEAD AND WORK THINGS OUT AND AND THAT IS WHAT'S GOING ON IN A VERY CONSTRUCTIVE MANNER AND I THINK THAT IT MAY BE BAFFLING TO SOME ADVOCATES ARE SOME PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES WHY WE WOULD MOVE OUT BOTH BILLS BUT I THINK WE'RE MOVING IT OUT IN THAT SPIRIT OF NOT BEING WHERE WE WERE AT THE END OF THE SESSION LAST YEAR BUT THE JUDGE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT CONSTRUCTIVE WAYS TO MOVE AHEAD BECAUSE THE CLOCK IS TICKING IN A RATHER HORRIFIC WAY ON CLIMATE AND WE CAN'T AFFORD TO JUST GO TO OUR CORNERS AND NOT TALK AND NOT WORKING OUT AND NOT FIND A COMMON GROUND I JUST WANT TO KNOWLEDGE IN THE TESTIMONY OF OF ONE OF THE KEY WITNESSES SO IN THAT SPIRIT TO CONTINUE ON WITH WHAT WE DID WITH THE PREVIOUS BILL I WILL MOVE THIS BILL SO THAT'S A MOTION FROM CENTER LAYERED AND -- COMING FROM CEREMONY THANK YOU AND THANK YOU SENATOR CONRAD I THINK WE'VE BEEN -- YOU KNOW VERY PUBLIC ABOUT HOW MUCH WE'VE WORKED ON THIS ISSUE AND YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT AT THIS IS A ONE OF THOSE ISSUES WERE YOU KNOW SOME STAKEHOLDERS HAVE EXPRESSED A LOT OF CONCERN SUPPORTING YOUR BILL IN THE SPIRIT OF ONGOING CONVERSATIONS AND THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHERE WE LAND -- AND THAT IS NOT AND I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR FOR THE RECORD IN ANY WAY TO DISMISS -- OVERRIDE OR NOT LISTEN TO THOSE THAT HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS I THINK THAT THOSE CONCERNS THINK THEY'RE SHARED BY MULTIPLE FOLKS I MEAN INCLUDING YOURSELF AND I I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT IN ORDER TO TRY TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS A CONVERSATION NEEDS TO CONTINUE ON THIS TOPIC AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH YOU AND WITH YOU KNOW REALLY SO MANY OTHER MEMBERS WHO HAVE WEIGHED IN ON THIS WHO I KNOW WILL BE WEIGHING IN CONVERSATION COMMA I SHARE YOUR GOAL OF WANTING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE WE GET UP BEFORE WE RE FOR ANY OF THESE BILLS POTENTIALLY REACH THE FOR THANK YOU CEREMONY -- SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS -- SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS IN OTHER AB ONE IN THE ONE OF THE AUDIENCE -- BUT PRESHEAF THE HARD WORK COMMITMENT FROM THE AUTHOR -- AND THAT AND REALLY THE HARD WORK IT IS COMMITTEE I WANTED THINK CATHERINE MORE PARTICULAR WHO -- PUT IN OVERTIME -- TO TRY TO GET THIS RIGHT SO STRONG FRAMEWORK HERE WITH ONE BIG OUTSTANDING ISSUE GOING FORWARD -- THAT I KNOW WE'RE ALL COMMITTED TO WORKING THROUGH SO AND ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND I I I ALWAYS APPRECIATE THE ROBUST CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE HAD AROUND THIS ISSUE -- IT DEFINITELY IS NOT AT AN EASY ISSUE TO GRAPPLE WITH AND I WANT TO THANK MY MY COLLEAGUES FOR ALL THE WORK ON THAT ON THE CLIMATE -- THE SENATE CLIMATE WORKING GROUP -- WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE HAD MANY MANY HOURS OF DISCUSSION IF I COULD MISTER CHAIR THAT -- I JUST WANNA MAKE A CLARIFICATION ON AN AMENDMENT NUMBER TWO -- ARE WHILE WE UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO HAVE THE MINERAL RIGHTS -- ALSO ALIGN WITH THE POOR RIGHT ABOUT WAS PIERCING BEING ABLE TO PIERCE -- FROM ONE ONE ONE I'M AT LEVEL TO THE OTHER AND YOU DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE THE MINERAL RIGHT SEPARATED FROM THE PAR RATE SO THAT THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE ON THAT THAT WAS -- DIRECTION THAT WE GOT FROM -- THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WHICH THIS BILL DOES NOT GO TO AND I THINK WE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WORK ON THAT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS I JUST WANT TO KIND OF POINT THAT OUT M. IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS IT IS IS ARTICULATED IN THIS PARTICULAR -- -- ONE SENTENCE AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT WE WERE GOING TO NEED TO WORK ON IT IT IT'S IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE NUANCED SO WITH THAT -- I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I.

AND I'LL JUST SAY JUST TO FURTHER CLARIFY THAT THE AMENDMENT REALLY HINGES ON THE THE WELLS OR OR DIVERSIONS THAT ARE UN PERMITTED SO THE IDEA HOPEFULLY IS THAT WE'RE USING THEIR RIGORS IN OUR IN OUR GROUNDWATER REGULATION FRAMEWORK TO GET LAW ENFORCEMENT THE INFORMATION THEY NEED AND SOME BASIS THAT THEY'RE GONNA NEED TO TO GO AFTER THESE GROWS WE KNOW THAT THEIR ALSO CARTELS OPERATING OUT THERE AND THAT THE FEDS ARE INVOLVED WE'VE HAD NUMEROUS ISSUES ON FAMILY FARM -- WITH NOT JUST DIVERSION OF WATER BUT ALL SO -- YOU KNOW THE RAMPANT USE OF ILLEGAL PESTICIDES -- HAD LOST PET -- TO SOME

I WANT TO ACCEPT THE EXCELLENT COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS LISTED ON PAGE SIX OF THE ANALYSIS YES I'M COMPLIMENTING MY OWN COMMITTEE AND I WILL SAY THAT THE THE THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THAT OF NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS RELATED TO BUILDINGS THAT'S IT THAT'S IT STRENGTHENS THE BILL AND AND FURTHER EXPANDS THE APERTURE TECHNOLOGIES AND AND SOLUTIONS THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO DEAL WITH THE EXTREME HEAT AS WE'VE LEARNED ALL TOO QUICKLY THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND EMERGE THIS EMERGENCY EYES BUT TO IN MY VIEW AND IN THE STATE IS PREPARING THIS OUT MORE AND MORE THE MORE WE LEARN -- HE IS THE GREAT KILLER I WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT WILDFIRES FLOODS SEA LEVEL RISE BUT THE SILENT KILLER OR THOSE HOT DAYS AND THOSE HOT NIGHTS THAT DON'T ALLOW PEOPLE TO RECOVER FROM THESE EXTREME HEAT EVENTS CREATE UNSAFE CONDITIONS FOR THE ELDERLY FOR INFANTS FOR CHILDREN FOR EXPECTANT MOTHERS AND WITH HEAT ON THE RISE ACCORDING THE GOVERNOR'S TRAFFIC STREAM HEAT REPORT WE'RE GONNA SEE DAILY AVERAGE MAXIMUM TEMPERATURES -- ANYWHERE FROM FOUR TO SIX DEGREES -- OVER THE COMING DECADES AS AN INCREASE FOR SOMEONE WHO'S HAD THE HOTTEST DAY EVER RECORDED IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY FOR THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION WITH A HUNDRED TWENTY DEGREES -- CANOGA PARK IN WOODLAND HILLS -- I KNOW ALL TOO WELL THE DANGERS HERE WE KNOW WE'RE ATTACKING THIS ISSUE WITH URBAN FORESTRY SOLUTIONS WITH RESILIENCE HUBS -- BUT THE THE THE PREMISES BILLS THAT WE REALLY ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT OUR BUILDING STOCK AND OUR HOUSING IN PARTICULAR AND HOW TO KEEP PEOPLE NOT JUST IN A POSITION WHERE THEY HAVE TO GO TO COOLING CENTERS ON A VERY HOT DAY OR HAVE TO LEAVE THEIR HOME BUT HOW THEY CAN BE SHELTERING IN PLACE I'M IN THE SAFETY OF A COOL AND HABITABLE HOME THE GOVERNOR PUT FORWARD A SERIES OF PROPOSALS AND THIS YEAR'S BUDGET DOES THE SAME -- WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT EVERYTHING FROM DIRECT INSTALL PROGRAMS TO LOW IN FOR LOW INCOME BUILDINGS AND RETROFITS LOOKING AT ELECTRIC ELECTRIFICATION INSULATION ENERGY EFFICIENCY AS WELL AS CONSUMER REBATES FOR UPGRADES TO OLD CLUNKY FURNACES AND AIR CONDITIONERS THAT CAN BE REPLACED WITH NEW OFFICIAL AFTER KEEP PUMPS -- AND ACCELERATING THE ADOPTION OF PHASING OUT CERTAIN ULTRALOW POTENTIAL REFRIGERANTS WITH NEW LOW GLOBAL WARMING FRAZIER IN TECHNOLOGY -- SO THIS BILL REALLY LOOKS IT PROVED PUTTING FORWARD AN APPLICATION TO LOW INCOME RESIDENTS WERE THE MOST EXTREME EXTREMELY VULNERABLE MAXIMIZE THE REACH THE REACH OF EASY EXISTING PROGRAMS AND THEN -- PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT TO REALLY MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE AND GET TESTIMONY FROM THE COMMUNITY I THINK MOST PEOPLE OUT THERE MAY NOT REALIZE THAT IF THEY HAVE THAT SWAMP COOLER THAT BUSTED AIR CONDITIONER -- OR THAT -- INSULATION THAT'S NOT WORKING THAT THEY ACTUALLY ARE NOW GOING TO HAVE SOME KIND OF RECOURSE FOR THEMSELVES HABITABLE AND TO TO DEAL WITH THE EXTREME HEAT THAT'S GOING TO BE -- CONTINUING TO BE A FATAL INFLUENCE ON CALIFORNIA FOR YEARS TO COME AND WITH ME TODAY TESTIFYING REMOTELY IS MERION BOARDS AND WITH AN RTC YOU MAY PROCEED GREAT GOOD MORNING BURNING COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- I THINK VERY IMPORTANT AND I'M A SENIOR SCIENTIST AT THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL I KNOW THAT MANY OF THE OTHERS COMMITTEE ARE LIKE SENATORS VERY DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF INCREASINGLY EXTREME HEAT ON OUR COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND OR TO MAKE A FINAL OPTIONS INCLUDING FOR NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS THE BURDEN OF EXTREME HEAT -- AND I KNOW THAT YOU ALSO KNOW THAT WE NEED TO GO TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE AND TO PREPARE FOR THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE WE'RE ALREADY EXPERIENCING I WOULD ARGUE THIS BILL WILL BE BOTH OF THOSE THINGS -- AS WELL AS ADDRESS INCOMING HOUSING DISPARITY FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCING EXTREME HEAT THE TOTAL PROPOSED A PROGRAM THAT COMBINES MEASURES THAT WOULD REDUCE H.

B. TWELVE SIXTY ONE THE MOTIONS DO PASSES AMENDED THE FIRST AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS STERN STERN ALRIGHT JONES ALAN EGGMAN HERTZBERG HUESO LEARNED HI THERE ALL RIGHT LET ALONE THAT BILL HAS TWO VOTES WILL PUT IT ON CALL AND BACK I DON'T HAVE ANY BILLS -- -- -- -- I COULD MAKE SOME UP BUT IT BUT IT'S LIKE TWELVE WHICH IS A SENATE BILL FOURTEEN OH FOUR BY SENATOR STERN AND LET ME JUST SAY ARM TO SENATORS DAUGHTER CORTESE YOUR THE TWO AUTHORS THAT ARE LEFT WHEN WE'RE DONE WITH THIS BILL WILL WANT TO MOVE TO YOU AND -- AND I'M SURE THE CHAIR WILL EXHORT ALL THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO SHOW UP FOR THE CALLS OF PROVIDING WE CAN ACTUALLY GET THROUGH THESE NEXT THREE BILLS ARE RECOGNIZED OF THE CHAIR FOR TO PRESENT SENATE BILL FOURTEEN OH FOUR THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS BEFORE BEGIN PRESENTATION I WANT TO JUST INFORM THE COMMITTEE THAT LAST WEEK WE ACCEPTED AMENDMENT AN ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE I DO TO TIMING ISSUES WE HAVE TO ADOPT THOSE AMENDMENTS HERE AND SENATE NATURAL RESOURCES SO IN ADDITION TO THE AMENDMENT THAT I'M ACCEPT BEING ON PAGE SEVENTY COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES WILL ALSO BE ADOPTING THE E. Q. AMENDMENTS -- AND I ALSO WANT TO STATE AT THE OUTSET -- THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SPECIFICALLY THOSE -- IN OPPOSITION WHO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BREADTH OF IN SCOPE OF THE BILL -- SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THESE AMENDMENTS TO BE OUR OUR FINAL -- EFFORT AT TAILORING THIS LEGISLATION I'M IN FACT WE'VE BEEN HAVING MORE PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS AS OF LATE AND THE COMMITTEE ITSELF HAS BEEN DOING SOME DEEPER RESEARCH WITH SOME OF YOUR -- WITH SOME OF YOUR INPUT ABOUT WAYS TO TO LOOK AT AREAS THAT WOULD BE INCLUDED -- RIGHT NOW IT DID THE LANGUAGES THAT THE BILL WOULD ONLY APPLY IN AREAS MAP BY STATE OR LOCAL AGENCIES AS AREAS CRITICAL TO HABITAT LINKAGE AND NATURAL RESOURCE PROTECTION OR OTHERWISE RELATED ABOUT DIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION BUT I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT THAT LANGUAGE MAY BE OVERLY BROAD SO WE WANT TO GET VERY SPECIFIC -- HERE IN TERMS OF EXACTLY WHAT KIND OF MAPS WERE TALKING ABOUT THERE SO THAT -- SHOULD THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD THAT PEOPLE WILL KNOW EXACTLY WHAT AREAS MAY BE IN OR OUT -- AND WHAT THE PROCESS WOULD BE -- BUT I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE ABOUT EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION ACRES OF OAK WOODLANDS IN ABOUT FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION ACRES OF OAK FOREST COMPRISING ABOUT ONE EIGHTH OF THE STATE -- THAT'S BLUE OAK VALLEY OAK OREGON WHITE OAK COASTAL LIVE OAK ANGLE MEADOW OAK INTERIOR LIVE OAK AND SO ON HABITAT FOR AT LEAST THREE HUNDRED THIRTEEN SPECIES OF BIRDS MORE TWO MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND PLANT SPECIES AN ESTIMATED FIVE THOUSAND INSECT SPECIES AND THERE ARE ALSO A HUNDRED THIRTY KNOWN SENSITIVE PLANT SPECIES THAT OCCUR IN OAK WOODLANDS OAK WOODLANDS ALSO PROVIDE CARBON SEQUESTRATION BENEFITS IMPROVE WATER QUALITY CRITICAL NATURE BASED SOLUTION TO PROVIDING -- FIRE BUFFERS FOR NEARBY COMMUNITIES NOW AMONG THOSE THOUSANDS OF ACRES THERE'S CERTAIN ACRES THAT MATTER MORE THAN OTHERS AND THE PROBLEM WITH CURRENT LAWS THAT THE COUNTY IS RESPONSIBLE AND STATES AND CITIES AND MUNICIPALITIES RESPONSIBLE FOR JURISDICTION OVER CONVERSION OF AN OAK WOODLAND OR THE THE DESTRUCTION OF -- OAK WOODLAND OFTEN RESULT IN ADOPTING A ONE TO ONE OAK TREE MITIGATION POLICY THAT DOES NOT ADEQUATELY ACCOUNT FOR THEIR VALUE WHETHER YOU'RE REPLACING A HUNDRED YEAR OAK WITH A A SAPLING OR WHETHER YOU'RE FAILING TO RECOGNIZE THAT CERTAIN STANDS OF OAK WOODLANDS -- WHILE THEY MAY BE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY OR IN A SORT OF MORE URBAN FACING TO THAT WILD LAND THEY ARE STILL PART OF THAT HABITAT AND THEREFORE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT SO THAT'S THE THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS TO GET TO ALL THOSE OAK WOODLANDS -- THAT ARE CURRENTLY NOT BEING ADEQUATELY MITIGATED FOR AND HOPEFULLY FIND SOME WAY TO MEET THE GOALS OF OF OUR HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE BUILD OUT -- WITHOUT DECIMATING OUR ECOSYSTEMS I THINK WE CAN DO BOTH ESPECIALLY WITH THE INCREASED FOCUS ON INFILL AND URBAN GREENING AND AND AND -- URBAN DEVELOPMENT I THINK THAT WE CAN WE CAN FIND A WAY TO TO NOT DESTROY THAT URBAN WILDLAND URBAN
