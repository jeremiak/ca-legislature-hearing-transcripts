DEVELOPMENT. AS WELL AS THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON NINE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS AND I WELCOME THE CHAIR OF THAT COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW HERE AT BY SIDE. I OUT WHEN A ESPECIALLY THANK OUR PANELISTS WHO HAVE TRAVELLED HERE ALTHOUGH ONE MISSED A PLANE WHICH ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IN A SECOND BUT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE TRAVELLED HERE TO PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S DISCUSSIONS. WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR INCITING AND YOUR INVOLVEMENT. IN THIS ISSUE. TOGETHER OUR TWO COMMITTEES CONDUCTOVERSIGHT OF REGULATORY BOARDS AND PRACTICES ACT. THROUGH THE SUNSET REVIEW OVERSIGHT PROCESS. THE BOARD OF BARBERENA IN COSMETOLOGY IS SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. GIVEN THE CONSIDERABLE RESEARCH AND COMMENTARY FROM ACROSS THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SPECTRUM SUGGESTING THAT ARE OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING SYSTEM MAY CREATE BARRIERS TO ENTRY THAT ARE NOT NECESSARY TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. WE ARE FOCUSING ON THIS TOPIC TO THE LANDS OF THE BOARD OF BARBER IN COSMETOLOGY AND THE PRACTICES THE BOARD REGULATES. THIS IS OUR SECOND HEARING IN A SERIES OF HEARINGS ON THIS BOARD AND PRACTICES SHE'S WITHIN THE BEAUTIFICATION SERVICE INDUSTRY. IT MAY NOT BE THAT WELL KNOWN BUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE LICENSE. TO PRACTICE THAT THIS WORK HERE. THAT'S QUITE A LOT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND. I AS WE LEARNED THAT ARE HEARING IN AUGUST THE TRAINING REQUIRED FOR LICENSURE. BY THE BOARD CAN COST TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. AND INDIVIDUALS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE. UP TO SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS OF TRAINING. MORE THAN WHAT WE REQUIRE FOR POLICE OFFICERS. EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIANS AND EVEN TATTOO ARTISTS. OUR GOAL TODAY IS TO LEARN ABOUT REQUIREMENTS FOR LICENSURE OF PROFESSIONS GENERALLY. AS WELL AS SPECIFIC TRENDS THROUGHOUT THE NATION AND THE REGULATION OF THE BEAUTIFICATION SERVICES. BEFORE WE WELCOME OUR FIRST WITNESS I'D LIKE TO INVITE. ASSEMBLY% MEMBER LOW CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE TO PROVIDE ANY OPENING REMARKS THAT HE WOULD LIKE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GLACIER AND THE UC OF THOSE COMMENTS ABOUT THE A SECOND INFORMATIONAL HEARING THAT WE'VE ARE HOSTING AND GIVES THE SENSE OF THE LEVEL SERIOUSNESS THAT WE TAKE A TO THIS MEASURE A PARTICULARLY WHEN WE ARE OUT OF SESSION BUT SIMILARLY IN THE REPORT WITH RESPECT TO. THE COMMENTS THAT THE CHURCH LATER MADE ON THE LIVER HOOVER COMMISSION ON THE BARRIERS TO ENTRY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TO CONTINUALLY TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE REGULATION WILL ALSO INTERNED CONSUMER PROTECTION BUT ALSO REMOVING AS MANY BEERS TO ENTRY FOR THE CURRENT EXISTENCE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I LOOK FOR TO THE CONTINUE DIALOGUE AND LET'S GET GOING.

YEAH SO SEE IF YOU'RE A. NUMBER PRESS PRESS AGAIN. AT A LATER ON THERE YOU GO. I CAN'T ABOUT YOU MOVE A LITTLE CLOSER TO YOU IF YOU CAN. I'M NOT TALL ENOUGH TO MAKE IT WORK VERY WELL. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME A LITTLE BIT YOU MAY HAVE MISSED BIOGRAPHY ON ME AND THE- MATERIALS THAT YOU HAVE. BASICALLY MY ROLE IN THIS WOULD BE THAT I HAVE SPENT THE BETTER PART OF THE LAST ELEVEN YEARS TRAVELING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WORKING WITH. VIRTUALLY EVERY STATE. ON HOW TO FIGURE OUT THIS SORT OF CONUNDRUM WE'VE GOTTEN GOTTEN INTO WITH OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING. IN THE COSMETOLOGY AND BARBERENA ARENA. I'M A BIG PORTION OF IT IS THAT MY BACKGROUND IS NOT IN COSMETOLOGY MY BACKGROUND IS IN OR SEEN AND MICROBIOLOGY SO. MY EFFORTS HAVE BEEN AT REFOCUSING US ON WHERE LICENSURE WAS MEANT TO BE WHICH IS AND HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY. SO I'VE HELP STATES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WITH REVISING THE RULES. THEIR CURRICULUM AND NOW A LOT OF STATES LOOKING AT REVISING WHAT THEY'RE REQUIRING AS ENTRY POINTS. THE CRITERIA FOR ENTRY INTO THIS CAREER FIELD. PUT TOGETHER A LITTLE BIT OF THE HISTORY OF WHAT'S GOING ON ON THEIR OUT THERE RIGHT NOW ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. SOME OF THE TRENDS THAT WE'RE SEEING ACROSS THE COUNTRY IS PRESSURE LITERALLY IN EVERY STATE. TO REDUCE OCCUPATIONAL LICENSURE. SCENE THE MOST COMMON THING I HEAR IS GOVERNOR'S WHO ARE GIVING A 30% REDUCTION. THEY WANT 30% ACROSS THE BOARD PAPERWORK. OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD WHATEVER YOU CAN DO TO REDUCEBY 30% SEEMS TO BE A NUMBER THAT IS PRETTY PREVAILING ACROSS THE COUNTRY. SO LOTS OF STATES ARE MAKING AN EFFORT TO REDUCE BOTH THE RULES ON THEIR CURRICULUM AND ALL THEIR LICENSURE BY ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT. THE CHANGING JOB MARKET I HAVE UP THERE WHICH IS KIND OF INTERESTING. IN AND OUT OF CAN PROBABLY SPEAK TO THIS LITTLE BIT BETTER BUT- THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR IS ESTIMATING THAT IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS. WE'LL SEE SOMEWHERE AROUND FORTY MILLION PEOPLE WITHOUT A JOB BASED ON. AUTOMATION ROBOTICS AND- ARTIFICIAL OR- ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. AND THOSE PEOPLE OUT BE OUT LOOKING FOR JOBS AND WHEN YOU'RE THIRTY SEVEN WITH A MORTGAGE AND THREE KIDS IT'S KIND OF DIFFICULT TO GO AND SPEND ANOTHER FOUR YEARS GOING TO GET A UNIVERSITY DEGREE. SO THERE ARE SOME PRESSURES IN THAT REGARD A TOWARDS WHAT WE WOULD HAVE CALLED LOCATIONS IN% THE PAST TO TRY TO GET THE BEARS ENTRY LOWERED. SO THAT MORE PEOPLE HAVE CAREER OPPORTUNITIES AND THOSE FIELDS. ON AND THEN MOST STATES THAT COMING OUT TRULY FUNDING HONEST THEY WANT TO HAVE A PREEMPTIVE TO THE DEREGULATION. RISK THEY WANT TO DO WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO SO PEOPLE DON'T COME IN AND TRYING TO DEREGULATE THEM ENTIRELY. SO IF I'M BEING TOTALLY HONEST THAT'S WHY A LOT OF STATES COME OUT TO TRY TO HELP THEM SO THAT THEY DON'T IT'S A PREEMPTIVE STRIKE. BEFORE SOMEBODY COMES IN AND GET THE BILL SUCCESSFUL SUCCESSFULLY. TO DE REGULATE THEM. SOME OF THE THINGS I'M SAYING THE MOST COMMON THING IS SEEN AS PRODUCTION HOURS. NEW YORK AND MASSACHUSETTS. HAVE ALWAYS HAD A THOUSAND HOURS AS THEIR. TWO POINT AND SO TO TESTING THOSE TO STATE THAT THE THOUSAND HOURS TO BE CLEAR MASSACHUSETTS. IS THE NUMBER ONE MOST ON OUR STATE ON TO FOR JUSTICE LIST AND THAT IS BECAUSE- IT'S A THOUSAND HOURS AND IN THE CLASSROOM BUT THEY ALSO REQUIRE. TWO HOURS OF APPRENTICESHIP OR TWO YEARS OF APPRENTICESHIP ON TOP OF THAT SO. IT DOES BECOME MUCH MORE LIKE THE PROCESS BUT I'M GONNA SHOW YOU WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO CHANGE THAT MASSACHUSETTS. WHICH IS KIND OF INTERESTING. TEXAS VERMONT INTO A THOUSAND HOURS THIS YEAR ON TEXAS DOESN'T TAKE PLACE UNTIL. NUMBER TWENTY. BUT THAT'S BEEN INTERESTING TO WATCH THAT CHANGE OVER ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT TEXAS IS THEY'VE BEEN DOING A THOUSAND HOURS AND THEIR HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAM. FOR EVER AND SO IF YOU WERE TO DECIDE AT SIXTEEN I WANT TO BE A COSMETOLOGIST YOU COULD GO FOR THOUSAND HOURS. GET YOUR CERTIFICATE AND GRADUATE AND BECOME A COSMETOLOGIST. IF THE DAY AFTER YOU GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL YOU WANT TO BECOME A COSMETOLOGIST TO KEEP FIFTEEN HUNDRED HOURS SO. THAT WAS SORT OF THERE WAS A- SORT AN EASY TRANSITION FOR THEM. FLORIDA IS GOING TO TWELVE HUNDRED HOURS ELEVEN STATES TO REDUCE THEIR HOURS IN THE LAST THREE YEARS THAT REDUCTION MIGHT NOT BE SIGNIFICANT SOME STATES HAVE GONE TO TWENTY FROMTWENTY ONE HUNDRED HOURS. TO EIGHT HAN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HOURS BUT THEY'RE STILL STARTING TO REDUCE AND THEN WE HAVE EIGHT STATES THAT ARE CURRENTLY LOOKING TO REDUCE THEIR HOURS. MOST OF THEM WERE TRYING TO GET TO A THOUSAND. THAT IS SEEMS TO BE THE GOAL THAT EVERYONE'S TRYING TO GET TO. NOW. SOME OF THE OTHER METHODS OF LICENSURE THAT ARE GOING ON OUT THERE THAT WERE SEEN. IN MASSACHUSETTS. NEW AND INNOVATIVE. THEY'RE HAVING A FEW ISSUES WITH IT AND I'M GOING TO BRING UP WHAT THE ISSUES ARE WHEN THEY DO ON. THEY HAVE A PROGRAM NOW WHERE THEY SPEND SIX HUNDRED HOURS IN THE SCHOOL AND FOUR HUNDRED HOURS. ARE IN A PAID AND I ONLY PAID BECAUSE THAT'S SIGNIFICANT FOR THEM. A PAID APPRENTICESHIPS SO THAT STUDENTS AND GO OUT AND WORK. NOT IN A SORT NOT IN A SCHOOL SETTING BUT OUT IN A SALON SETTING WHETHER. A PRACTICE BY THE- ASSEMBLY SALON OWNERS. THE REQUIRED TO BE PAID DURING THAT. TIME PERIOD. SO THEY'RE STARTING TO. YOU KNOW ON WHILE THEY LEARN TYPE OF CNCEPT. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THEY'RE HAVING WITH IT IS THEY WOULD SAY THE CAUTIONARY NOTE THERE IS TO HAVE GOOD OVERSIGHT EVERY APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. I HEARD PRESENTATION BY AN FBI AGENT COUPLE YEARS AGO ABOUT HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND- APPRENTICESHIP SEEM TO BE A WAY A LOT OF. HIM TRAFFICKING CASES ARE FUNNELED INTO THE STATE'S. SO REAL CAUTION WITH THE OVERSIGHT ON THAT WAS WHAT THEY WOULD TELL YOU. OREGON HAS BEEN DOING COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION INTESTINE THEY'VE OFFERED IT FOR A NUMBER OF. YEARS WHAT THEY HAVE. EVERYBODY I TALKED TO THE WORKING PEOPLE OF WORK WITH IN OREGON. THE GREAT THING ABOUT IT IS STUDENTS PROCEED AT THEIR OWN PACE BASED ON WHAT THE COMPANY SAYS SO ARGUABLY YOU COULD FINISH SCHOOL. MUCH SOONER IF YOU CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPETENCE MORE READILY. YOU COULD ALSO DO COMPETENCY BASED TESTING THAT WOULD ALLOW STUDENT THAT IS VERY. IS ABLE TO FINISH IN A VERY MUCH SHORTER TIME THAN SOMEBODY WHO REQUIRES A LITTLE BIT MORE. THEIR BIGGEST CHALLENGE IN THE REASON ONLY ABOUT TWENTY SCHOOLS ARE 20% OF THE SCHOOLS OFFER. COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION AN ORGAN IS BECAUSE OF FINANCIAL AID SO IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET FINANCIAL AID FOR THE STUDENTS AND SO. ON THEY HAVE A DROP OFF OF STUDENTS WHO WANT TO DO THAT I KEEP LOOKING YOU TO CHANGE JUST. THIS SEEMS TO BE THE MOST POPULAR THING EVERYBODY'S LOOKING AT AND ORGAN HAS BEEN DOING THIS ACTUALLY SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. YOU WOULD KIND OF NOT BY THE WAY THAT THEIR STRUCTURE REALLY WORKS. BUT STACKABLE LICENSES IS REALLY WHAT I HEAR OTHER STATE WANTING TO TALK ABOUT DOING. AN IN OREGON THEY TOOK AWAY THE COSMETOLOGY UMBRELLA LICENSE ENTIRELY THEY THERE YOU CAN'T GET IT BACK BECAUSE LICENSE IN OREGON ANYMORE. YOU KNOW GET A HAIR DESIGN LICENSE WHICH ALSO INCLUDES CHEMICALS AYE BARBERING LICENSE AND AESTHETIC LICENSE OR NAILS LICENSE YOU GO IN AND YOU DO THE ONE THING. THE ONE AREA THAT YOU WANT TO WORK IN. AND THEN YOU CAN GO BACK AND GET ANOTHER LICENSE AND YOU CAN CONTINUE TO GET ALL FOUR OF THE LICENSES. BUT YOU DON'T TO YOU DO YOU DO NOT. GET ONE COSMETOLOGY LICENSE. OBVIOUSLY THAT REDUCES A BARRIER TO ENTRY BECAUSE NOW I CAN GO AND GET A NAILS LYSONS IN TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE HOURS AND SEVENTY OPERATIONS. ON A THAT'S OBVIOUSLY SIGNIFICANT LAST TIME AND SIGNIFICANTLY LESS MONEY. IF ALL I EVER WANT TO DO IS NAILS. THEY'VE TAKEN HELP THE PUBLIC SAFETY OUT OF A GENERIC CLICK FOR EXAMPLE CALIFORNIA YOU HAVE A HELP THE PUBLIC SECTOR AN INFECTION CONTROL. ON NUMBER OF HOURS THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO DO. IN ORGAN WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS EACH OF THOSE SEPARATE LICENSES HAS ITS OWN HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY OR INFECTION CONTROL COMPONENT. AND IT IS BASED SPECIFICALLY. ON THAT THE PRACTICE. ONE OF THE THINGS THEY WOULD TELL YOU AS A CAUTIONARY TALE THE STATE WOULD TELL YOU THAT'S NOT THE SCHOOL. BECAUSE OF I TALKED SCHOOL THAT TIME IS FOR THE STATE IT. IS THAT THERE'S A TENDENCY TO WANT TO BUNDLE THESE AT THE- SCHOOL LEVEL. SO THAT BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE NAILS AND THE AESTHETICS BY THEMSELVES. WOULD NOT QUALIFY. FINANCIAL BATES. BUNDLE THEM. SO WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS BETTER THAN FIFTY PERCENT. OF THE STUDENTS TODAY. CAN ARE GOING THE FULL. EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HOURS AND BASICALLY. GETTING A COP LICENSE BUT. DELTA THERE THERE. THERE'S AN INSIDE THEM TO COULD NOT TOGETHER SO. THERE ARE SOME CAUTIONARY TALES AND HOW TO MAKE THAT WORK A LITTLE BIT BETTER. THIS IS SORT OF THE OVERRIDING PROBLEM THAT I WOULD SAY THAT WE HAVE IN HOW WE DO LICENSING TODAY. IS THAT THIS IS HOW MOST OF OUR CURRICULUM SO TODAY. ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT IT NO MATTER WHAT MY CAR THE HAIR INDUSTRY. AND 20% SET AND NAILS AND SKIN. BUT THIS IS THE RISK THAT WE SEE OUT THERE FROM HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY PERSPECTIVE THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF INJURIES THAT WE SEE. COME OUT OF THE NAIL AND THE SKIN MARKET. AND THE FEW THAT COME OUT OF HER MARKET ARE ALMOST ALWAYS CHEMICAL RELATED. AND SO. THERE DOES NEED IN MY ROOM IN MY ESTIMATION NEED TO BE SOME DRIVE TOWARDS GETTING TOWARD. ADDING TO REGULATE STARTING TO WRITE CURRICULUM STARTING TO MAKE THE ENTRY TO THIS PROFESSION BE BASED ON HOW DO I. MITIGATE THE RISK OF WHERE THE RISK REALLY LIVE LET'S REALLY TALK ABOUT THAT LET'S BE HONEST ABOUT WHERE THE RISKS ARE. THERE ARE REAL RISK IN THIS INDUSTRY BUT LET'S BE HONEST WHAT THEY ARE AND LET'S START THERE AND LET'S WORK FROM THAT POINT. ON THE FEDERAL CONVERSATION WHICH I THINK MATT MATT WAS THAT HE WAS IS GOING TO GET TO I'LL PREFACE IT A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE HE WAS GETTING READY TO TALK ABOUT THE AWESOME OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING EDUCATION CONSORTIUM. AND WHAT THAT WAS WAS A JOINT EFFORT BETWEEN NCSL IN THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND THEY TOOK I THINK IT STARTED TEN STATES I THINK IT AND NOT BEING EIGHTEEN STATES. MADE SOME TEAMS AND WE LOOKED AT THIRTY LICENSE OCCUPATION ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND IT WAS REALLY A SURVEY PUT A BEST PRACTICE DURING WHAT COULD HAPPEN WHAT HAPPENED I DON'T BRING IT UP. ONE NUMBER OF MARYLAND HOME TEAM HAS THAT I WAS SELECTED FOR THE HOME TEAM BECAUSE WE LOOKED AT COSMIC COSMETOLOGY BARBERING WE ALSO LOOKED AT PLUMBING HVAC AND REALTORS AND THE MARYLAND TIME TEAM. THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT WERE TAKE AWAYS FOR ME THAT I THOUGHT WERE SIGNIFICANT ONE IS THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OUT AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC. ABOUT HOW HARD SOME OF THESE JOBS WILL BE TO FILL IN THE COMING YEARS SAID THAT NOBODY WANTS THEIR KID TO NOT GO TO A FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY THAT IS EVERY. PARENT'S NIGHTMARE ACCORDING TO THESE PEOPLE THAT THEIR CHILD WILL NOT USE IT FOR YOUR EDUCATION AT THEIR CHILD CHOOSE A LOCATION SO THAT WE DO NEED TO MAKE THESE OCCUPATIONS WE NEED TO KEEP THEM I IN MY OPINION STRUCTURED WE NEED TO KEEP THEM AT A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE. A LOT OF TIMES WHEN A STUDENT COMES HOME AND SAYS I WANT TO BE A PLUMBER I WANT TO BE A COSMETOLOGIST WHATEVER THOSE THINGS ARE THE TO DISAPPOINTMENT AND THIS IS WHAT I HEARD FROM HIS MEDIAN IS A DISAPPOINTMENT TO THEIR PARENTS AND I THINK KEEP. IT A LITTLE MORE ON THE. THING AND I GET TO GO TO WORK SOONER I DON'T HAVE TO SPEND ALL THIS TIME. THEY WERE MORE SUCCESSFUL AND THEY REPORTED MORE JOB SATISFACTION IN THE LONG TERM. BECAUSE THE OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE AND WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN A TYPICALLY. A WELL ESTABLISHED IN THEIR LIVES THERE TYPICALLY IN THESE CAREER PATHS IN THEIR EARLY TWENTIES. THEY JUST WANT TO GET TO WORK THEY WANT TO DO THIS THING SO. WHAT WE CAN DO TO GET THEM OUT FASTER AND LEARNING. ON THEIR FEET. WHAT I'M A NURSE. AND YOU WOULDN'T WANT ME TO BE YOUR NURSE ON MY FIRST AT A NURSING SCHOOL I WAS NOT GREAT. I LEARNED THE VAST MAJORITY OF I LEARNED ABOUT BEING A NURSE BEING ON THE FLOOR RIGHT I DIDN'T. I DIDN'T LEARN IT ON SCHOOL I LEARNED A LOT IN SCHOOL BIG PREPARED ME. FOR WHAT I LEARNED ON THE FLOOR SO. I UNDERSTAND THAT GET TO WORK. ON AND WHAT. THERE IS A DEPARTMENT OF LABOR REPORT THAT'S GOING TO BE RELEASED. IT MIGHT BE RELEASED THIS WEEK. AND I WAS REVIEWER ON THAT REPORT. AND WHAT THAT REPORT. I CAN ONLY SENATE JORDAN GENERAL SENSE IS GOING TO. SUPPORT AT AM IS LICENSURE FOR THE HELP THE PUBLIC SAFETY ASPECT. OF WHAT. WHAT IS DONE IN THIS FIELD. AND CERTIFICATION FOR THE TECHNIQUE AREAS SO WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT HOW TO SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING NOT DO THEY DO IT SAFELY WHEN WE SAY HOW DO YOU DO IT. THAT WOULD BECOME MORE OF A CERTIFICATION A TECHNIQUE. ISSUE VERSUS A LICENSURE ISSUE. LIKE I HAVE TO SAY THIS BECAUSE THERE ARE REAL RISKS THERE ARE REAL RISKS IN THE REAL RISK THESE ARE THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD I COULD SHOW YOU REALLY NASTY PICTURES MAKE YOU ALL GO GROW I MEAN I'VE- HUNDREDS OF DISGUSTING PICTURES ON MY COMPUTER. I USED TO WORK ON THESE ON AIRPLANES AND TELL PEOPLE SITTING NEXT TO ME GAVE ME DIRTY LOOKS. BUT THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE NOT UNCOMMON RIGHT A CHEMICAL BURN FROM SOMEBODY GETTING A HAIR COLOR SERVICE. A MIKE THIS IS ACTUALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE MICROPLATE THE EYEBROWS OR SEEN DOWN HERE ON THE BOTTOM. MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER THAT EVEN NOT EVEN IN EVEN REGULATED FIELD BECAUSE IT TAKES SO LONG FOR STATES TO CATCH UP WITH WHAT. GOES ON OUT IN THE REAL WORLD THE BY THE TIME THE STATE RIGHT TO RULE PEOPLE OF ALL SORTS ARE ALREADY DOING THIS. THIS ACTIS. AND CREATING ALL KINDS OF HAVOC AND ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT I DO SEE STATES FACING IS THAT. AND ONE OF THE REASONS I'M OF A PROPONENT OF KEEPING SOME LICENSE FROM PLACE. IS THAT. WHAT I'M NOT A COME TELL JUST I DON'T OFFEND ANY COSMETOLOGIST SITTING BEHIND ME. BUT THE REALITY IS THEY COME UP WITH SOME REALLY DUMB IDEAS. THEY THAT ARE PAID THAT HURT PEOPLE RIGHT AND SO WE HAVE TO KEEP OUR ARMS AROUND IT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SAY. NO YOU CAN'T DO THAT IF YOU DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IT THIS WAY. IN ORDER TO BE SAFE SO IS RUSTY WHAT WAS THE PROCEDURE BEING DONE THE EYEBROWS MICRO GERMAN LINE ON THAT. MIKE MY KERN MICRO PLANING ON EYEBROWS. MICRO BLADING ITS THE BLADE THAT THEY RUN THROUGH THE EYEBROWS AND THEY- PUT. SOME KIND OF A PIGMENT IN THERE AND IT MAKES EYEBROWS AND THESE OTHER I GET HUNDREDS OF THESE. LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF THESE PICTURES A MONTH. PEOPLE SENDING ME THOSE INJURIES. BUT IN MOST STATES THEY CONSIDERED NON REGULATED BECAUSE IT'S NOT SPECIFICALLY REGULATED YET IT'S KIND OF A- NEW. SORT OF A NEW TECHNIQUE SO IS THAT A TATOO. IT IS A FORM OF ATTACH IT'S NOT IT WOULDN'T FALL UNDER THAT YOUR TATTOO REGULATIONS. SO IT'S A FORM OF TATTOOING THAT WOULD NOT FOUNDER TATTOO REGULATIONS AND I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON TATTOOING BUT- ISN'T THERE A LOT OF REDNESS AND SORENESS THAT HAPPENS IT TO. SOME OF THESE ARE VERY LONG TERM INJURIES SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE LITTLE IN THESE TACKLE END UP WITH A YEAR JUST GIVE AN EXAMPLE CS ONE UNDERSTAND OF THE ONE ON THE TOP RIGHT I DO WANT TO BE THE ONE OF THE TOP RATED YOU WANNA SPEND A SECOND ON BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING WE FORGET WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT SOMEBODY GETS EDUCATED ON A COSMETOLOGY SCHOOL. AS A LADY HAD A MASTECTOMY FOR BREAST CANCER. AND GOVERNOR ELSTON AND SOMEBODY USED A NOT PROPERLY DISINFECTED EMPLOYMENT ON HER AND SHE NOW HAS PERMANENT DAMAGING TO HER LEFT ARM IS MUCH LARGER THAT HER RIGHT ARM. AND PATIENTS THAT HAD MASTECTOMIES MONTH ACTIVITIES ONE BATMAN CARE CAN MAKE THEM PERMANENTLY HAVE. REALLY JUST FIGURING OUT COMES AND SO SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE JUST THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE TEACHING WE SHOULD BE XIN OUT TO THE PUBLIC WE. SHOULD BE TEACHING THE CONSUMER BUT ALSO BE SPENDING TIME ON IT. I MET THE WOMAN WHO HAS LIVED A DAM AND HER ONE RIGHT ARM WAY SIXTY POUNDS ONE ARM WAY SIXTY POUNDS. SHE'S DISABLED FROM WORKING SHE I MEAN SHE HAS ALL KINDS OF DISABILITY. AND HERS CAME FROM A MANAGER SITUATION SO ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE REAL RISK THERE I'M NOT GOING TO YOU KNOW SHOW YOU THAT CRAZY THINGS ON. YOU KNOW THERE'S LITTLE THINGS THAT HAPPEN IS BIG THINGS HAPPEN ON THE OTHER IN. RARE CIRCUMSTANCES. I'VE TESTIFIED WRONGFUL DEATH CASES BUT- I'VE ASSOCIATED. WITH THOSE OF THE RARITIES THESE OF THE COMMON THINGS THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT THE SAM. IF I CAN INTERRUPT YOU AGAIN I'M ALWAYS WELL WAS SOMEWHAT WARY ABOUT ANECDOTAL INFORMATION EVEN PICTURES BUT- CAN YOU SPEAK TO. ME SAY THIS IS COMMON. I GOT A PRECAUTION FLIGHT SAY WELL. YOU GOT TO GIVE A CONTEXT IS THERE ANY CONTEXT YOU CAN GIVE TO. THAT THAT'LL GET YOUR RIGHT IN WHAT I WHAT I WAS TRYING TO SAY IS IT THESE ARE THEM SORT OF MIDDLE OF THE ROAD THINGS IF YOU WERE TO TALK TO THE LICENSING. THE BOARD IN ANY STATE. AND THEY WERE TO SAY WE GOT FIVE HUNDRED COMPLAINTS OF INJURY THIS YEAR. THE VAST MAJORITY ARE GONNA FALL INTO THINGS LIKE THIS A CHEMICAL BURN OKAY. USUALLY THESE ARE ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN IS NOT A REFLECTION ON. WHETHER IT'S 1% OF THOSE WHO HAVE THOSE PROCEDURES OR- 10% OR FRACTION OF A PERSON THAT'S VERY ALSO DIFFICULT TO TELL BECAUSE- QUITE FRANKLY. A LOT OF FOR EXAMPLE THE SCROLL DOWN ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT. THIS IS AN INFECTIOUS PROCESS SHE HAD HER EYEBROWS WAXED IN TWENTY ELEVEN THIS IS HOW SHE LOOKED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. BUT IT TOOK AWHILE FOR THE INFECTION TO TAKE PLACE RIGHT SHE GOT THE SHE WAS EXPOSED TO THE- TO A BACTERIA. SHE GOT AN INFECTION AND BY THE TIME SHE WENT TO THE BOARD IN THE STATE SHE WAS AND THEY SAID WELL YOU KIND OF GOT MY SUMMER ELSE. THERE IS A DISASSOCIATION IS NOT UNLIKE IF I TRY TO COME HERE AND TELL YOU THAT PEOPLE GET FOOD POISONING RESTAURANTS AND YOU ASKED ME TO GIVE ME YOUR NUMBER. I CAN'T I CAN'T DEFINITIVELY SAY I GOT IT FROM THIS RESTAURANT BECAUSE I GOT SICK TWELVE HOURS LATER SO I CAN GIVE YOU NUMBER BUT WHAT I CAN SAY. IS THE NUMBER THAT ARE REPORTED. OUR IS PROBABLY UNDER REPORTED FOR THE NUMBER OF INJURIES THAT ACTUALLY EXIST BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME AGAIN CORRELATION BETWEEN THE TWO THINGS. THAT MAKE SENSE ONE THING IT DOES FOR THE THAT PEOPLE FALL OFF OF THANKS DOES THAT MAKE BICYCLE RIDING ON SAFE. AND THEN WE LOOK FOR CONTEXT THERE RIGHT. AND IS WE MAKE THEM DECIDE ABOUT LAWS REGULATING HELMETS WE TRIED AT LEAST HAVE SOME CONTEXT. I THINK WHAT'S DIFFERENT I GET WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I THINK WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS IN A LOT OF OTHER. LICENSED OCCUPATIONS. IS THAT WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS IT'S OKAY FOR YOU TO PUT YOUR HANDS ON OTHER OTHER PEOPLE STRANGERS. AND USE ALL KINDS OF THINGS CHEMICALS MACHINES ALL KINDS OF THINGS ON OTHER HUMAN. IF I RIDE A BIKE AND I FALL OFF. IT'S ME AND MY BIKE RIGHT IN AND I'VE I AM I HAVE TO RIDE MY BIKE SAFELY IT'S MY DECISION. BUT WHAT WE'RE SAYING IN IN THE BEAUTY INDUSTRY IS WERE ALLOWING PEOPLE. SOMETIMES PEOPLE THAT ARE MAYBE NOT EVEN VERY WELL EDUCATED TO. THERE WERE USING THINGS AT THE LABELS MIGHT NOT ADEQUATELY REFRESH THE **** WITH THAT PRODUCT CAN DO SO I THINK THERE IS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN YOU KNOW I'VE HEARD THE ARGUMENT FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT I CAN GO BY HER COLOR TARGET. AND THAT HAVE TO A LICENSE PLATE ON WHAT THE COLOUR TARGET ALL I DO IS MAKE TWO THINGS TOGETHER THERE IS NO QUESTION HOW I DO IT RIGHT HOW I MIX THOSE TWO THINGS TOGETHER I DON'T HAVE ANY DISCRETION ON WHETHER I USE MORE OF A CHEMICAL OR NOT SO I THINK IT IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. IF OKAY IN ALL FAIRNESS OR NOT AND THEN LAST BUT NOT LEAST I DO THIS IS PROBABLY THE ONE OF THE BIGGEST EVER WRITING THINGS PEOPLE FORGET AND THAT IS. RECIPROCITY IF I IF A PERSON IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S A LICENSE AND LET'S SAY IN ANY STATE LET'S SAY A STATE GOES WAY LOW LET'S. TAKE A FIVE HUNDRED HOURS. PART OF BEING ABLE TO MOVE AND CONTINUE YOUR EMPLOYMENT AND OTHER STATE IS TO GET A LICENSE IN ANOTHER STATE BECAUSE- EVEN IF CALIFORNIA WERE TO MAKE A CHANGE. FIRST OF FORTY NINE OTHER STATES OUT THERE THAT STILL HAVE A REQUIREMENT FOR ENTRY INTO THEIR STATE TO BECOME LICENSE. A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THAT IS IN FLORIDA THEY MOVED THEIR NAIL AND AESTHETICS. TURNED ME INTO A CERTIFICATION INSTEAD OF A LICENSE. AND NOBODY WILL ACCEPT AS THE ESTHETICIANS OR NOW TAX. IN ANY OF THE OTHER STATES TO COME WORK THERE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT LICENSED. OR CERTIFIED. SO THERE ARE THINGS TO CONSIDER I'M NOT SAYING YOU CAN YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING YOU WANT TO DO. BUT YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER WHAT IT DOES TO YOUR CURRENTLY. LICENSED PEOPLE AND ALL THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WANT TO GET LICENSE OR WANT TO WORK AS A COSMETOLOGIST. IF THEY WANT TO LEAVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RIGHT THAT DOES BECOME OF. A BIGGER ISSUE. I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT INCLUDES OUR MILITARY FAMILIES. IMMIGRANTS ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH PROBLEMS RIGHT MOVING FROM ONE STATE TO ANOTHER AND ALL OF THOSE GROUPS OFPEOPLE WILL BE. WHAT DIFFICULTY LEAVING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IF THEIR CAREER PATH IS. AS A COSMETOLOGIST FOR BARBER. AND STARTING OUT. AND THEN THIS IS JUST MY EXPERIENCE MY LAST SIGH THIS IS MY EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH OTHER STATES WHAT HAS MADE FOR SUCCESSFUL CHANGE WERE HAVE STATES HAD PROBLEMS. THAT THEY DID NOT PERCEIVE THE FIRST ONE IS. JUST I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO HAVE A THOUGHTFUL PROCESS WHICH APPEARS LIKE YOU'RE ALREADY DOING TAKE THE TIME TO DO THE RIGHT THING. WHEN STATES DO THINGS TOO QUICKLY. THERE% SEEMS TO BE A LOT LACK OF. LOOKING AT HOW ALL THE- PLAYERS FIT INTO IT. THIS SECOND ONE HAVING A SINGLE AGENCY TO PROVIDE. OVERSIGHT OVER ALL THE ASPECTS. WHEN YOU HAVE TOO MANY AGENCIES INVOLVED THAT'S ONE THING I'VE SEEN A LOT OF STATES LIKE IT TOO MANY AGENCIES INVOLVED. AND WHAT HAPPENS IS YOUR THINGS THAT FALL TO THE CRACKS THERE'S NO NOBODY WANTS TO BE. NOBODY'S ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANYONE THING AND SO HAVING ONE AGENCY HAVING OVERSIGHT. AND THEN UNDERSTANDING OBVIOUSLY THE FINANCIAL ISSUES FOR ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS. ANTICIPATING THAT COMING IN WITH A SOLUTION TO SAY WE UNDERSTAND. FOR THE STUDENTS FOR THE SCHOOLS FOR THAT OVERSIGHT AGENCY THERE WILL BE SOME FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS. AND WHAT DO WE FOUR SEE IF YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM THE ANSWER BUT WHAT WE FORESEE. AS BEING AWAY TO MEDICATE THOSE FEARS. AND THAT'S ALL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF FOR THE TESTIMONY OF I DID HAVE A COUPLE FOLLOW QUESTIONS. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT RECIPROCITY AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE STATES. ARE THEY BASED ON ANY CERTAIN. REQUIREMENTS SAME TYPE OF TEXT BOOKS US INTENT OF CURRICULUM HOW IS THAT RIGHT RECIPROCITY SO IT WORKED OUT REALLY IT IS THERE IS A MAP THAT THE NATIONAL COUNCIL COUNCIL STATE LEGISLATURES HAS MAYBE HE'LL BE ABLE TO SHOW IT AT SOME POINT. AND IT SHOWS THE DESPITE THE VAST DISPARITY OF ALL AMONGST THE STATE'S SOME STATES WILL ALLOW YOU TO COME IN AND YOUR WORK YOUR WORK HISTORY HE WORKED FOR I THINK CALIFORNIA'S LAST THREE THREE OUT THE LAST FIVE YEARS AS A COSMETOLOGY ANOTHER STATE THAT COUNTS. SOME STATES LIKE OHIO MAKE YOU RETEST NO MATTER HOW LONG YOU WORKED IF YOU WORK FOR THIRTY OUT OF THIRTY YEARS YOU KNOW ON THE FIELD YOU HAVE TO RETEST ON NATIONAL EXAM IT'S ALL OVER THE BOARD SOME STATES WILL MAKE YOU MAKE UP THE HOURS SO IF YOU WORK IN TEXAS FOR EXAMPLE WORKS AT THAT AS AN HOUR. AND A YOU GO TO A STATE THAT IS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HOURS THEY MAY MAKE YOU GO BACK TO SCHOOL FOR EIGHT HUNDRED HOURS. TODAY AND TAKE A AN EXAM IT'S VERY VERY SICK. WIDELY ACROSS THE COUNTRY THERE'S NO SET METHOD. AND YOU TALK ABOUT EXAMS. IS THERE ANY TYPE OF. I'D NATIONAL EXAMINE EACH OF THESE FIELDS IN WHICH ONE CAN THEN. POINT THERE AND SAY. FORGET HOW MANY. HOURS OF TRAINING. OR EXPERIENCE YOU HAVE FORGET HOW MANY TEST YEAH IT'S THE COMPETENCY BASE THAT WOULD BE NICE. AND WHAT IS CALLED THE NATIONAL EXAM RIGHT NOW WHICH IS THE AND I SEE EXAM AS CURRENTLY ONLY IN TWENTY EIGHT STATES OF THE START REALLY EVERY STATE UNTIL WE GET AN EXAM THAT IS ACCEPTED BY. IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF STATES RIGHT NOW I'M SOME STATES CREATE THEIR OWN EXAM SOME STATES HAVE PRACTICAL SOME STATES DOWN. IT'S A THERE'S NO CONSENSUS AROUND THE COUNTRY OF HOW TESTING IS HOW EVEN TESTING IS DONE. SO AND I GUESS IN CALIFORNIA WE USE THE NATIONAL EXAMS AS AND I SWEET TO ME. AND SO WHY NOT JUST THAT. YOU KNOW IT. I GUESS TEACH FOR THE TEST IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO POSE THE QUESTION BUT- WHAT WHY WHY NOT JUST HAVE. A SET THE STANDARD OF PASSING THAT NATIONAL EXAM. AND IF YOU CAN DO THAT JUST. IF YOU IF YOU WANT TO BE A LAWYER IN CALIFORNIA YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT TELL I'M NERVOUS AT THE PAST YOU HAVE TO PASS THE STATE BAR. RIGHT AND THEN YOU CAN PRACTICE AND- DO SOME STATES PROVIDE THAT AS AN ALTERNATIVE SIMPLY THAT YOU PASSED THE STANDARDS. AND THEREFORE YOU CAN YOU GET THE LICENSE. THAT'S VERY LIMITED SO THERE IS BEEN A LOT OF TALK AT THE CONSORTIUM GROUPS. ABOUT CONTACT LAW WHICH IS THE BEST WAY PROBABLY TO ACHIEVE THAT I'M A NURSE AND WE OPERATE AT A NURSING CONTACT. THIRTY FOUR STATES PARTICIPATE IF I WERE TO MOVE TO ANY OF THE OTHER STATES IT DUMPED US PAID. I WOULD HAVE OTHER ENTRY REQUIREMENTS SO. IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A THERE'S NOT IT THERE IS NOT A NATIONAL EXAM THAT EVERY STATE EXCEPT YET. I WILL SAY THAT SO IS THERE IS THE ABILITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO EAT I MEAN. SO CERTAINLY WERE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL STANDARDS. THAT COME INTO PLAY BUT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THERE'S A LOT. IS THE ROOM FOR CALIFORNIA TOOK TO CARPET SOME PATH IN TERMS OF COMPETENCY AS THE STANDARD NOT EDUCATION. YOU COULD CARVE YOUR OWN PATH IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE OTHER FORTY NINE STATES ARE GONNA ACCEPTED FOR ENTRY FROM I'LL FROM SOMEBODY FROM CALIFORNIA THAT THAT'S MY WHOLE POINT THERE THERE IS SUCH A SORT OF SOVEREIGNTY ISSUE IN ALL THE STATES THAT IT'S HARD TO MAKE EVERYBODY. COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE I HEAR THE DRIVER'S LICENSE ARGUMENT ALL THE TIME THAT I GET A DRIVER'S LICENSE AND I LIVE IN KANSAS I GET A DRIVER'S LICENSE IN KANSAS AND I CAN DRIVE IN ALL FIFTY STATES. THAT'S THROUGH CONTACT LAW AND THAT IS THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IF THIS INDUSTRY CAN EMBRACE IT WOULD I THINK I'M WOULD. HELP THE INDUSTRY IF EVERYBODY COULD AGREE THAT IF I'M SAFE AND OF THAT I'M ALSO SAFE IN CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE. BUT THAT'S NOT WHERE IT IS TODAY I WILL SAY THAT IT'S NOT THERE IN HOUSTON AND I'M SENSITIVE TO THE RECIPROCITY ISSUE BUT IT IS ABOUT TRYING TO PROVIDE THE RIGHT STANDARDS FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO PRACTICE IN CALIFORNIA MOST OF WHOM ARE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS OKAY COULD YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT. PRIVATE VERSUS PUBLIC EDUCATION IN THESE FIELDS. WHO IS WHO IS WHO WHO'S TRAINING WHO'S EDUCATING. I IT AND IF YOU HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE THERE YOU COULD SHARED BE GREAT. SO ARE YOU SPEAKING WHEN HE SAID PRIVATE EDUCATION VERSUS A PUBLIC ARE USED WHEN YOU SAY PUBLIC ARE YOU TALKING THE COLLEGE TYPE EDUCATION OR THE HIGH SCHOOL BASED PROGRAMS I'M DONE TALKING ABOUT EITHER ONE THAT. THAT THAT AS I UNDERSTAND IT SO MANY OF THE- THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS THAT ARE OFFERED IN THIS AREA IN CALIFORNIA ARE DONE THROUGH PRIVATE. ENTITIES FOR PROFIT NONPROFIT. THAT THE VERY FEW WERE DONE THROUGH OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND CERTAINLY PUBLIC SCHOOLS. IS THAT CONSISTENT WITH WHAT YOU UNDERSTAND HAPPENS AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT HAPPENS AROUND THE COUNTRY EVERYBODY HAS SOME MIX OF THOSE TWO THINGS A LOT OF STATES ALSO HAVE HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAMS. SO STUDENT COULD ARGUE THEY GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND GET THEIR COSMETOLOGY LICENSE AND GO TO WORK AND MOST OF THOSE STATES. I WOULD SAY THERE'S NO. REAL ANSWER HERE IT IS DEPENDENT ON. THERE'S GOOD SCHOOLS. SCHOOLS I MEAN JUST LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE THERE ARE THERE'S GOOD YOU KNOW. IF THE STATE REALLY WANTED TO CLEAN AND THAT THEY WOULDN'T BE FROM MAKING A NEW. PIECE OF LEGISLATION IT WOULD BE GETTING BETTER OVERSIGHT TO SEE SOMEBODY AND SOME TYPE OF A AGENCY THAT COULD. THE BAD SCHOOLS AND GET RID OF THEM GIVE THEM THAT OVERSIGHT TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE THERE'S GOOD SCHOOLS ARE BAD SCHOOLS. IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM THE ONE THING THAT THEY DO BENEFIT FROM IS THAT BENEFIT FROM A STANDARDIZED CURRICULUM. AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. SEEMS TO HAVE A THE STRUCTURE AROUND THEM THE SCHOOL STRUCTURE AROUND THEM EVERYTHING ELSE THAT IS HAPPENING FROM AN ADMINISTRATIVE LEVEL SEEM TO HELP THEM GET PEOPLE THROUGH AND AT A CERTAIN REGIMENTED SORT OF WAY BUT AYE AYES PLACE IN GOOD SCHOOLS BAD SCHOOLS GOOD TEACHERS BAD TEACHERS AND THAT THE PROBLEM IN MY MIND ISN'T HE DOES IT IT'S WHO. WHO HAS OVERSIGHT TO REGULATE THE GOOD AND THE BAD. I GOT SHOULD THERE AYE AYE THERE. I THINK FOR ME AT LEAST IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THAT YEAH IT'S ALSO ABOUT. KEEPING COSTS LOW SO THE PRIVATE SECTOR PROGRAMS THAT BY THEIR VERY NATURE ARE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN IF THEY WERE OFFERED A COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO I THINK THERE F THERE'S A FEW MORE THE ISSUES INVOLVED IN. IN THAT CHOICE AND. AT THE END AND IT DOES. GIVEN HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN PROFESSIONAL CAREERS OUR CAREERS IN THESE FIELDS AND GIVEN HOW MUCH HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ENROLLING IN THOSE PRIVATE COURSES HERE IN OUR STATE AND I LOOK FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THAT AS WE GO FORWARD WITH OUR- HEARING PROCESS. IT SEEMS LIKE THAT IT IT OUR OUR PUBLIC AREAS OUR PUBLICATIONS IS THE CANARY COLLEGES FAILING TO PROVIDE THAT CURRICULUM OPPORTUNITY. THAT THAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING A BETTER JOB WE HAVE OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES. CALIFORNIA AND ARE THEY BEING RESPONSIVE TO THE- THE INTEREST THAT'S OUT THERE. THE I. D. IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE DONE FOR THE LAST ELEVEN YEARS AS I'VE DONE A LOT OF IN SCHOOL ON TRAININGS ALL GO OUT AND DO INFECTION CONTROL AND- ON TALK ABOUT CHEMICAL SAFETY IN THE SCHOOL SO I'VE BEEN IN BOTH ENVIRONMENTS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE TYPE ENVIRONMENT. EVEN HIGH SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT AND IN THE PRIVATE SCHOOL SECTOR AYE I DON'T HAVE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE- PUBLIC SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT IS ANY LESS VALUABLE THAN WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE- PRIVATE COMMITTEE I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A COST DIFFERENTIAL. AND BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS ALSO THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT. AMOUNT. THERE IS THAT THERE'S NOT AS MUCH AVAILABILITY OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM SO PEOPLE WHO WANT TO DO IT TODAY. YOU KNOW THEY CAN'T GET IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM NON GO TO THE PRIVATE SCHOOL SYSTEM RIGHT AND THAT RAISES SOME OF THE AREA OF NURSING. IF THEY'RE NURSING PUBLIC NURSING OPERAS COOLS ARE FULL. YOU UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO CHOOSE A MORE EXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE THEY COULD ARGUE. THERE'S A HIGHER QUALITY LEVEL BUT WHATEVER THE CASE. IT'S OUT OF AN ABSENCE OF OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE PUBLIC TRACK. AND IT SEEMS LIKE THAT THAT MAY BE A AT PLAY HERE AS WELL. LET ME FINALLY ASK YOU ABOUT THE SLIDE THAT YOU PRESENTED ON RISK VERSUS CURRICULUM. WHERE YOU HAD THE UPSIDE DOWN TRIANGLE SHOWING THAT FOR THE FOR THOSE. PROCEDURES THAT ARE MOST AT RISK WOULD PROVIDE THE LOWEST LEVEL OF CURRICULUM WHAT WHY IS THAT IF HEALTH AND SAFETY IS THE FOR STANDARD THAT I THINK WE ALL. MUTUALLY SHARE IN TERMS OF. MAKING SURE THOSE WHO PRACTICE. THESE TRADES ARE DOING IN A SAFE MANNER. WHY IS IT THAT THE CURRICULUMS UPSIDE DOWN IN YOUR VIEW. THAT IS NOT A QUESTION THAT I FEEL LIKE I KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS I FEEL LIKE. I'M ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS TO THAT. IS THAT IF I WANT TO DO NAILS. FIVE I DON'T KNOW I HAVE TO SIT THROUGH. A HUNDRED HOURS A HAIR I DON'T KNOW I HAVE TO DO THAT IF I WANT TO DO NOW IS I SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO NAILS AND DO IT SAFELY AND MOVE ON. BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT HOW THAT HAS OCCURRED I'M NOT SURE OVER TIME HOW THE CURRICULUM HAS GROWN SO MUCH IN THE HAIR INDUSTRY IN EIGHT STANDARD COSMETOLOGY LICENSE I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER FOR THAT. OKAY ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. A DECISION YET THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND CHOCOLATE SHOULD BE TO SIMILAR THAT THE YOU TALKED ABOUT THE COMBINATION OF THE CURRICULUM THOUGH GIVEN THE KIND OF SCHOLARSHIPS AND FINANCIAL AID THAT ALL COMES WITH AN ASSOCIATE OF IT SO. YOU DID YOU WOULD YOU WOULD YOU AGREE AT THE OBSERVATION THAT PERHAPS THAN THE SCHOOLS MAY BE PUTTING UP THE STRUCTURE IN PLACE TO FOCUS ON STUDENT GOING TO THE PROGRAMS BECAUSE OF THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES THAT THE STRUCTURE IN PLACE FOR CURRICULUM. HELPS TO PROMOTE THAT THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER THING I'M NOT REALLY PREPARED I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW I DO KNOW THAT PROGRAMS WHERE. IN STATES THAT I'VE WORKED AND WHERE THEY HAVE. LOWER OUR OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENTRY. WHEN STUDENTS CANNOT GET FINANCIAL AID THOSE ARE NOT POPULAR CHOICES THAT I CAN SAY THAT THAT IS NOT DEPEND ON POPULAR CHOICES BECAUSE- OF THE- THE FINANCIAL ASPECT OF THEM. SURE EVEN THOUGH. THERE ARE STATES WHERE THERE'S A- THERE ARE STATES WHERE. BECAUSE THE HOURS ARE SO LOW. IN SOME OF THE FOR EXAMPLE FOR NAILS. ARGUABLY THE IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING SOME THEY COULD PAY FOR YOU KNOW IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THERE ARE PROGRAMS THAT DO. THEY SELL FINANCE THEMSELVES THAT KIND OF THING BUT I. I CAN'T ANSWER FOR WHY THE CURRICULUM GREW THE WAY IT DID. YOU KNOW I HAVE NO ANSWERS. SURE ABOUT ANY OF OBSERVATION THERE MAY BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO ANY OF THE ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO THE DEMOGRAPHICS AS CERTAINLY IN THE CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE THE LANGUAGE ACCESS AND WITHIN THESE INDUSTRIES I THINK I SAW ON THEIR STATISTICS THAT IS ALMOST THREE TO ONE FOR ASIAN LANGUAGES. WE DON'T NECESSARILY COLLECT THE STATISTICS ON THAT OF THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF LICENSED INDIVIDUALS BUT UP THE ACTUAL TEST TAKERS THAT THREE THE ALL THE RATIOS ALMOST THREE TO ONE IN TERMS OF TAKING THESE EXAMS IN THE NATION LANGUAGE THERE BY THE- HIGH PERCENTAGE OF ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDERS MANY INTO OFTENTIMES RECENT IMMIGRANTS. SOME OF THESE OTHER COSTS BEARERS COULD ALSO BE IN EFFECT TO DO YOU HAVE ANY OBSERVATIONS WITH AFFECTED THE INTERACTIVE BETTER ABLE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION FROM WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN ABOUT A THEY I THINK THEY GET THEIR LIFE THEIR EXAM IN FIVE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES FIVE EIGHT DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. AND ONE THING I WILL SAY IS THAT YOU HAVE A UNIQUE PROBLEM NOT A PROBLEM UNIQUE SITUATION IN CALIFORNIA SOMETHING THAT REALLY NO OTHER STATE HAS YOU HAVE I GO TO RURAL STATES OR I GO TO STATES THAT ARE. VERY HIGHLY POPULATED SMALL STATES WITH HIGH POPULATION BASES. EVERYBODY IS A LITTLE BIT OF BUT YOU GUYS REALLY HAVE. THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS ARE THE WORST OF BOTH WORLDS FROM A LEGISLATIVE STANDPOINT BECAUSE YOU HAVE SO MUCH REAL AREA I THINK PEOPLE THE OTHER FORTY NINE STATES. FORGET HOW MUCH ROLL ERA YOU HAVE LIKE TO DO IS DRIVE BETWEEN. TWO YOU KNOW POPULATION CENTERS AND YOU'LL SEE HOW MUCH REAL AREA HAVE TO DEAL WITH. YOU HAVE IMMIGRANTS FROM FAR MORE COUNTRIES THAN ALMOST VERY IN A VERY FEW STATES HAVE AS MANY IMMIGRANTS AS YOU DO. AND YOU'RE DEALING WITH RURAL AND POPULOUS BASED AM. ISSUES SO I THINK. YOU GUYS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AS YOU SAID IN THE BEGINNING TO SORT OF BE THE LEADERS AND ALL THIS IS WHY I WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO. THINK IT THROUGH IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU PUT FORWARD BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE UNIQUE. ISSUES WITH. IN THERE ARE STATES WILL ONLY GIVE THEIR EXAMINE ENGLISH THERE'S LOTS OF THEM THERE ARE A LOT OF STATES IT WILL ONLY GIVE THAT. EXAMINE ENGLISH BECAUSE- IN THEIR MINDS GOT TO SPEAK ENGLISH WELL LOOK. I CAN FUNCTION IN THE COMMUNITY AND LOTSOF I CAN FUNCTION A LOT THE COMMUNITIES HERE AND NEVER SPEAK A WORD OF ENGLISH AND BE PERFECTLY FUNCTIONAL. AND DO MY JOB SAFELY SO. TO YOUR QUESTION ADAM MIGHT BE BETTER ABLE TO ANSWER IT BUT I'VE CAN ENCOURAGE YOU TO KEEP ALL THINGS AND YOU KNOW. AND ALSO TO HAVE SORT OF A VISION FOR WHAT OTHER PEOPLE WHO LOOK IN THE CALIFORNIA SEE. IT'S PRETTY EVEN I HAVE A TON OF POWER HERE RIGHT AND I THINK YOU KNOW THAT AND I THINK THAT USED HARD JUDICIOUSLY. BECAUSE IT DOES FILTER I STARTED MY PRESENTATION MEANT TO CALL MY NATIONAL PRESENTATIONS THIS YEAR. AND I SHOWED MAPS AND I SAID THIS IS. IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR THIS IS TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR THIS IS TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND ONE NEXT HOLY READ. ONE NAP IS READ A LITTLE BIT OF GREEN AND THE FIRST SCREEN STATE. OF CALIFORNIA AND THEN TWENTY TWELVE AND ALL PATCHWORK IN IN TWENTY NINETEEN WORDS ALL GREEN AND A PLACE TO STATES THAT AREN'T. AND THAT WAS. A LEGISLATION DENIED STATE THAT HOW QUICKLY IT HAPPENED AND SO. THE POWER THAT. YOU KNOW STATES LIKE YOURS HAVE. MAKING DECISIONS TO THE TO THE CAN FOLLOW SO. THANK YOU TO USE ITS USE THAT POWERS YOU KNOW ANNA IF THOUGHTFUL WAY. VERY GOOD AT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY MISTRUSTING WATCHES STICK AROUND AND SEE THAT THERE'S FURTHER CONVERSATION WE COULD HAVE. BUT I WANT TO NOW WELCOME THE ADAM HIGGINBOTTOM HERE TO. OUR HEARING ROOM YOU'RE THE DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE NEVADA STATE BOARD OF COSMETOLOGY. WE HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN THIS FIELD WE WELCOME YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME AND THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO. SPEAK TO US THE CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OFFER. MY NAME IS ADAM HIGGINBOTHAM I AM THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE ABOUT US THE POOR COSMETOLOGY. PRIOR TO THAT I WAS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE WEST VIRGINIA STATE BAR PERSON COSMETOLOGIST. I'M NOT A LICENSED PARTICIPANT NOR HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN. ANY BEAUTY SERVICE TECHNIQUES. I DO HAVE ELEVEN YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WITH OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING BOARDS. AND IN THOSE ELEVEN YEARS I'VE BEEN PART OF TEAMS. THAT HAVE USE TECHNOLOGY TO DELIVER FAST APPLICATION PROCESSING TIMES. TO COLLECT BETTER DATA DURING OUR INSPECTIONS. TO IMPROVE OUR CONSUMER AWARENESS BY DISPLAYING SO ON INSPECTION RESULTS ON A WEBSITE IN REAL TIME. OF WE USE TECHNOLOGY TO DEVELOP AN API WITH THE CONTACT THE CONTRACTED STATE VENDOR. TO STREAMLINE NEVADA'S TESTING TO LICENSING PROCESS. AND WE USE TECHNOLOGY TO DELIVER TO ORGANIZE OUR DATA. THAT WE COLLECT SO WE CAN REVIEW REPORTS TO IMPROVE OUR CONSUMER AWARENESS AND TO IMPROVE THE DELIVERY. OF OUR TESTING LICENSING AND INSPECTION AND EDUCATION SERVICES. TODAY I'M PRESENTING A LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT A PROJECT IN ABOUT HIS BEEN WORKING ON. THE STAFF HAS BEEN WORKING ON A PROJECT TO IDENTIFY THE RISKS IN BEAUTY SERVICES. IT IS TO IS MY OUR TO BE ONE OF THE OF THE CONTRIBUTORS TO BE COMMUNICATING ABOUT THE PROJECT TODAY. BEFORE YOU. YOU HAVE TO REMIND ME. HI SINCE FEBRUARY OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE NEVADA STATE BOARD COSMETOLOGY'S BEEN WORKING ON A PROJECT TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL RISKS IN NINETEEN COMMON BEAUTY SERVICES AND THESE ARE BEAUTY SERVICES THAT A NEWLY MARKET PARTICIPANTS. SHOULD BE ABLE TO PERFORM SAFELY AND WITH BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE TECHNIQUES BEHIND. AS OF OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THERE BEEN MORE THAN THIRTY PROJECT POLITICA COLLABORATORS WITH OVER FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OF LICENSE EXPERIENCE. AND THEY REPRESENT SIXTEEN DIFFERENT STATE JURISDICTIONS. THE COLLABORATORS HAVE INCLUDED INDUSTRY REGULATORS SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS THEORY EXAM CONTENT DEVELOPERS PRACTICAL EXAM RAIDERS LICENSED INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS IN LICENSED INSTRUCTORS IN THE FIELDS OF COSMETOLOGY HAIR DESIGN AESTHETICS NOW TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY DISTRIBUTOR. THE PROJECT COLLABORATORS HAVE HELD SEVERAL MEETINGS WORK PRODUCT MEETINGS WHERE WE'VE WE'VE WHERE WE HAVE REVIEWED HAIR NAIL AND SKIN CARE SERVICES. EARLY IT IS AS ESTIMATED THAT WE HAVE SPENT OVER TWO THOUSAND HOURS WORKING ON THIS PROJECT. NEVADA STATE BORDER COSMETOLOGY'S A SELF SUPPORTING BOARD THAT IS FULLY ON THOMAS. AND WE CONSTANTLY USE TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE THE DELIVERY OF OUR SERVICES. THE IMPLEMENTED TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS HAVE LED TO OUR EFFICIENCIES. THAT HAS CREATED THE TIME FOR THE STAFF TO WORK ON THIS PROJECT. ALONG WITH OUR FOR OUR BOARD STRUCTURES IT LEADS PER HAS PROVIDED US WITH THE FLEXIBILITY NEEDED SO WE COLLABORATE WITH OUR PARTNERS ON THIS PROJECT. THE VOTE IS EXPECTED TO RELEASE TO THE PUBLIC WITH SOME LIMITATIONS THE CONCLUSIONS OF THIS PROJECT IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY. YOU'RE THE FIRST BODY TO SEE THIS. CLICK CLICK. THE PROJECT STARTED OUT WITH SEVEN OBJECTIVES THE FIRST OBJECTIVE WAS TO IDENTIFY COMMON BEAUTY SERVICES THE BEAUTY SERVICE INDUSTRY NEOPHYTES SHOULD BE ABLE TO PERFORM UNDER CURRENT COSMETOLOGY LICENSING STRUCTURE. pADVANCED SERVICES AND TECHNIQUES. THE SECOND OBJECTIVE IS WITH IS TO LIST THE STEPS IN SUB STEPS NEEDED IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THAT BEAUTY SERVICE. THE THIRD OBJECTIVE WAS TO IDENTIFY THE TOOLS AND IMPLEMENTS THAT WE USED IN EACH OF THOSE SERVICES THE FORCE OF FOURTH OBJECTIVE IDENTIFIED THE PRODUCTS USED IN EACH OF THOSE SERVICES AND AT EACH STEP ALONG THE WAY OF THAT SERVICE. A FIST THE FIFTH OBJECTIVE IDENTIFIES THE AREA OF RISK FOR EACH STEP IN SUB STEP OF THAT SERVICE. THIS SIX OBJECTIVE IDENTIFIED WHETHER THE RISK WAS AN INJURY OR INFECTION. AND THE SEVENTH OBJECTIVE IDENTIFIED THE WRIST OUTCOME POSSIBILITIES. AFTER WE IDENTIFY THE COMMON HERE NOW AND SKIN SERVICES AND WE WERE ABLE TO COMPLETE THE STEPS AND SUB STEPS NEEDED TO PERFORM THAT SERVICE. THE COLLABORATORS THEN ANSWERED. FOR EACH STEP IN EACH SUB STEP THE SAME SIX QUESTIONS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. WE ASKED WHAT TOOL OR EMPLOYMENT WAS USED AT THIS SPECIFIC. POINT IN THE SERVICE WHAT PRODUCT WAS USED AT THIS POINT IN THE SERVICE WHAT CHEMICALS ARE MIXED TO APPLIED AT THAT SPECIFIC POINT IN THE SERVICE. WHAT PROTECTIVE GEAR SHOULD BE WORN BY THE LICENSE PROFESSIONAL OR BY THE CONSUMER. AT THAT SPECIFIC. POINT A SERVICE. WE IDENTIFY WE ASK WHAT ARE THE RISKS TO THE CONSUMER AT THAT SPECIFIC POINT IN ORDER THE REST TO THE BEAUTY SERVICE PROFESSIONAL. AT THAT THE SERVICE POINT. THE DATA COLLECTED FROM THIS PROJECT WAS PUT INTO A SIMPLE EQUATION BY TAKING THE NUMBER. OF SERVICES. THE NUMBER OF SERVICE STEPS NEEDED TO COMPLETE. OF THE I'M SORRY THE SIMPLE QUESTIONS BY TAKING THE NUMBER OF THE SERVICE THE SERVICE IS NUMBER STEPS OR SUBSTANCE THERE WERE IDENTIFIED AS RISKS. AND DIVIDED INTO THE TOTAL NUMBER STEPS ARE SUCH STEPS FOR THE SERVICE. TO ESTABLISH A WRIST PERCENTAGE THAT WE CAN HOPE THAT WE HOPE LEADS TO IMPROVED CONSUMER AWARENESS. THE WRIST PERCENTAGES NOT A PERCENTAGE OF AN INJURY OR INFECTION ACTUALLY OCCURRING. IT SHOWS THE WRIST PERCENTAGE INDICATES THE NUMBER OF AREAS. WITHIN A SERVICE THAT IF THAT PARTICULAR STEP IS NOT PERFORMED PROPERLY. WHAT ARE THE OUTCOMES. IN THE NEXT FEW SLIDES ALSO WE'LL SHOW YOU TWO ON RELEASE SERVICE INFO SHEETS. THAT IDENTIFIED THE FACIAL SERVICE AND EYELASH EXTENSION SERVICE. SO ON THIS SERVICE INFO SHE YOU'LL SEE. THIS PART IS JUST ONE PART ONE OF A THREE SECTION SERVICE INFO SHEET. HI THIS SERVICE SERVICE AND SO IN FOR INFO SHE JUST BROKE DOWN A THREE SECTIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS PRESENTATION THIS FIRST SECTION CONTAINS THE RIBS NOW IF YOU NOTICE IN THE PERCENTAGE INDICATOR ON THE RIGHT CORNER. IT IDENTIFIES THAT THEIR SIXTY PERFECT 64% OF THE FACIAL SERVICES STEPS OR SUBSTANCE COULD POSE A RISK TO A CONSUMER IF THE STEPPER SUB STEP IS NOT PROPERLY PERFORM. AS WE TRANSITION INTO. THE OTHER AREA THE INFO SHE DECEMBER SHEET IDENTIFIES THE PARTICULAR TOOLS AND IMPLEMENT SOME PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED. AT THAT MOMENT OF THE SERVICE. AND THEN TRANSITIONING INTO. THE THIRD PART OF THE INFO SHEET YOU'LL SEE IT BREAKS DOWN THE STEPS IN SUB STEPS NEEDED. TO PERFORM THE FACIAL SERVICE AND THE SUB STEPS THAT ARE HIGHLIGHTED IN RED REPRESENT THAT IF THIS SERVICE AREA IS PERFORMED IMPROPERLY. IT COULD POSE A RISK TO A CONSUMER. AND I HAVE THE SAME BREAKDOWN FOR THE EYELASH EXTENSION THIS PERCENTAGE I'M SORRY THIS PERCENTAGE IS AT FIFTY NINE PERCENT. BREAKDOWN AND IF YOU CAN SEE ON THE SERVICE IN FOR SHEET SHOWS INFECTION RELATED CROSS CONTAMINATION IN THE POSSIBLE OUTCOMES OF THAT INFECTION THE INJURY OR DAMAGE RELATED TO A SPECIFIC SERVICE. AND IT OUTLINES THE DAMAGE SURE THE INJURY WHETHER IT'S WHAT THE INJURY COULD BE. RELATED TO THAT SPECIFIC SERVICE. AND THEN THERE ARE THE CLIENT CONSULTATION PART WHICH IS WHERE. IT'S THE IT'S A LICENSED PROFESSIONALS KNOWLEDGE BASE THAT SIN IS THAT THEY HAVE AN IN INSIDE THE BRAIN THAT IS RETRIEVED FOR PERFORMING A SCAN ANALYSIS. IT'S ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS TO A CAN'T TO THEIR TO THEIR CUSTOMER. THAT WOULD HELP IDENTIFY PRODUCT ALLARD ALLERGIES OR CURRENT MEDICS MEDICINE TO MAKE COUNTERACT WITH THE PRODUCTS THAT A CONSUMER MAY BE RECEIVING. ON THEIR SKIN. AND ALSO IF THE PROPER ANALYSIS ISN'T DONE THEN A SERVICE CAN BE PERFORMED ON IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY WHICH COULD RESULT IN. A PRODUCT INGREDIENT GETTING INSIDE OF A CUT OR A WOUND AND THAT MEASUREMENT. THERE ARE TOO MANY VARIABLES AT THAT POINT. AGAIN TOOLS IMPLEMENTS ARE LISTED FOR THE EYELASH EXTENSION SERVICE. ALONG WITH THE STEPS RELATED TO PERFORM AN EYELASH EXTENSION SERVICE AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A STEP IN A SUBSTANCE. A STEP IS A SUPER CATEGORY THAT SAYS THIS IS THE GENERAL. INFORMATION IT'S GOING TO BE TALKED ABOUT. WALLACE SUCH STEP IS TALKING ABOUT THE ACTUAL DETAILS WITHIN THAT STEP. SO THE SUB STEP FOR CRYING FOR THE STEP FOR CLIENT CONSULTATION YOU CAN SEE HAS BOTH AN INJURY I CON ALONG WITH AN INFECTION I CON. NOW YOU'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW FOR THE EYELASH EXTENSION IF THIS WAS A HAIR CUT. YOU WILL NOT SEE ANY RISKS IN A CLIENT CONSULTATION BECAUSE. SKIN CARE THIS PARTICULAR SERVICE MAY REQUIRE. CERTAIN PRELIMINARY QUESTIONS SHOULD BE IDENTIFIED FOR THIS TYPE OF SERVICE THAT MIGHT NOT. BE COMPARABLE TO ANOTHER THE SERVICE. AS MENTIONED EARLIER THE PROJECT IS STILL ONGOING AND THE REPORT ISN'T EXPECTED TO BE RELEASED UNTIL JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY. HOWEVER WE ARE WORKING ON THESE TEN HAIR CARE SERVICES BLOW DRY CAP HIGHLIGHT CHEMICAL RELAXER CURLING SERVICE. FORTY FOUR YEAR OLD HIGHLIGHTS HERE CALLER. CUTTING PERM WAVE SO AND EXTENSIONS AND SHAMPOO AND DEEP CONDITIONER SERVICES. THE SERVICES RELATED TO HER NOW CARE WILL BE. MANAGER NOW ENHANCEMENTS PEDICURE AND POLISH. AND FOR SKIN CARE WE'LL HAVE EYELASH EXTENSIONS FACIAL MAKEUP TWEEZING AND WAXING SERVICES. THE DATA COLLECTION PROCESS SO FAR NO HAS LED TO THE ORGANIZATION OF MORE THAN THREE THREE THOUSAND DATA POINTS THEY CAN CAN PINPOINT WHEN AND WHERE AN ACTUAL TOOL. AND A PRODUCT IS MET ON A CONSUMER FOR PARTICULAR BEAUTY SERVICE END THAT KNOWLEDGE IS APPLIED TO EXECUTE DOES SO WE CAN FIND OUT THE STEPS AND SUB STEPS FOR THE SPEEDY SERVICES. AS THE PROJECT COLLABORATORS TOOK A STEP BACK FROM THE DATA THAT WERE ACTUALLY COLLECTING IN THIS PROJECT. IT WAS OBSERVE THAT THIS INFORMATION COULD LEAD TO FUTURE DEVELOPMENT IN OTHER AREAS. SOME OF THOSE AREAS SOME OF THE POTENTIAL USES FOR THIS INFORMATION COULD. COULD BE IN SOME CAPACITY USE FOR CONSUMER AWARENESS INFORMATION WHICH IS THE PRIMARY DRIVEN PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT IN THE STATE OF NEVADA. BUT ALSO COULD BE USED FOR LEGISLATIVE INFORMATION EDUCATIONAL CONTENT. DILLON DEVELOPMENT IMPROVED SANITATION INSPECTION PROCESS IS THEORY EXAMINATION CONTENT APPLIED TO SPECIFIC AREAS OF RISK AND IN OTHER AREAS THAT WE HAVE NOT YET LISTED OR IDENTIFIED. MAN IN CLOSING I LIKE TO THINK YOU OFFER INVITING. MYSELF AND SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF ALL THE COLLABORATORS THAT HAVE WORKED VERY HARD ON THIS PROJECT. I'M VERY HONORED TO BE THE ONE COMMUNICATING SO THANK YOU THE PERSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT OF MY APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY AND THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING IN NEVADA. SO I WANT TO STRETCH YOU A LITTLE BIT HERE AND WE HAD A CONVERSATION WITH LESLIE EARLIER ABOUT A COUPLE OF AREAS THAT. YA ARE RAISING ISSUES THAT WERE TAKEN A LOOK AT AND I WANTED TO SEE IF YOU WANTED AT TALK ABOUT HOW NEVADA'S HANDLING SOME OF THOSE SOME OF THOSE ISSUES. WHAT IS THE TYPICAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENT IN NEVADA FOR COSMETOLOGY LICENSE. THE OUR REQUIREMENT IS SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS FOR COSMETOLOGY ANY YOU HEARD LESLIE TALK ABOUT THE RISK VERSUS THE CURRICULUM ISSUE. HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THAT ADD ANY COMMENTS ABOUT THAT. I THINK THAT THIS PROJECT IS A GOOD FOUNDATION TO WORK ON DETAILING AREAS OF WHAT LESLIE WAS TALKING ABOUT ON HER INVERTED PYRAMID. OF I THINK THE INFORMATION IT'S THE SAME TYPE OF INFORMATION JUST COMMUNICATING DIFFERENT MANNER. OUR A AND SHE I'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT IN SOME STATES THEY HAVE A MUCH MORE NARROW LICENSE IN THESE FIELDS AND A GREAT EXAMPLE I THINK WAS THE ONE. THAT FOCUSED ON NAILS WITH THE LEAST AMOUNT OF FAT TRAINING FOR CERTIFICATIONS THAT RIGHT LESLIE. HAVE YOU EXAMINED THAT AS AN AS A- CENTRAL PRACTICE INTO THAT AT ALL. MORE NARROW LICENSES PROVIDING EASIER ACCESS. FOR THE TRAINING EDUCATION AND THEN PRACTICE. I'M SORRY ARE YOU REFERRING TO MORE SPUR NICHE LICENSES ARE SPECIALLY LICENSES YES YOU WE HAVE AN ABOUT A IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WE IMPLEMENTED A MAKE UP ARTISTS CERTIFICATION A THREADING. CERTIFICATION AS WELL AND A THREADING ESTABLISHMENT CERTIFICATION WHICH IS A TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR FEE FILL OUT THE APPLICATION. AND THEY CAN PERFORM THOSE TYPES OF SERVICES HE SAID THREADING WHAT IS THAT THREADING IS SEE TECHNIQUE WE USE THREAD. TO USE THE THREAD. ROLLING ACROSS THIS THE EYEBROW TO REMOVE YOUR HAIR AND THE FROM EUROPE. OKAY GOOD LEARN SOMETHING IT'S AN ANCIENT TECHNIQUE FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN TOLD IT'S IT GOES BACK OKAY LONG BEFORE WE WERE HERE OKAY FAIR ENOUGH THANKS FOR SHARING THAT. DO YOU A IN TERMS OF THAT WITH WHERE IT IS IN NEVADA. BEGIN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF YOUR PRESENCE HERE. OUT WHERE WHERE DO MOST OF YOUR RESIDENTS GET TRAINING FOR THESE CERTIFICATIONS ARE AS IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THE PRIVATE SIDE ANY OBSERVATIONS THERE YOU COULD SHARE. IN NEVADA WE HAVE TO SCHOOLS THAT ARE STATE FUNDED ONE IS IN A VOCATIONAL SCHOOL THAT'S ONLY FOR. HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. AND THE OTHER US STATE FUNDED SCHOOLS ANY PRISON. HIGH I CAN X. CAN COMMUNICATE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE IN WEST VIRGINIA. WHENEVER I WAS I START IN WEST VIRGINIA TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THERE WERE ELEVEN FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS TO STATE FUNDED SCHOOLS. I'VE BEEN AWAY FROM FROM THAT WE MADE SOME LEGISLATIVE CHANGES IN THE SIX YEARS I WAS THERE I'VE BEEN GONE FIVE YEARS NOW. AND SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT WE MADE THERE ARE NOW FIFTEEN STATE FUNDED SCHOOLS PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS. SO IT HAS GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY WHILE THE FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS IN WEST VIRGINIA I THINK. HAS REMAINED RELATIVELY THE SAME AND I CAN SHARE A CONTACT INFORMATION WITH YOU AFTER THIS. IF YOU ALL WOULD LIKE TO LEARN MORE INFORMATION THANK YOU FOR THAT AND AN END OF THAT I HAS THE LICENSES BEEN GOING UP OR DOWN ANY KENNETH. A TREND THAT YOU SEE IN YOUR STATE ON THAT. WE'RE OUR NUMBERS ARE INCREASING AND LESLIE'S AT THE SAME NATIONALLY DO YOU KNOW OF ANY NATIONAL NUMBERS ABOUT. HOW MANY FOLKS ARE GETTING LICENSES GOING UP OR DOWN. VERY DEAR MICROPHONE PLACE VERY GEOGRAPHICAL SO YOU'LL SEE AND MORE AND THE MORE RURAL STATES IT STAYS FAIRLY STABLE IN THE- TO CLEAN THE STATE TREE SEE MORE MOVEMENT OF THE YOUNGER POPULATION YOU'LL SEE THOSE NUMBERS GOING UP. BUT IN THE RURAL STATES IT STAYS PRETTY STATIC. AND GET OUT OF GOING BACK TO YOU. DO YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF A CONFIDENCE MODEL FOR GETTING A LICENSE OR IS IT STILL BASED ON HOURS OF EDUCATION. OR ON THE JOB EXPERIENCE. OUR HOURS OF FOR SCHOOL IF YOU LIVE IN A RURAL AREA THEN WE HAVE AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THAT COULD BE UTILIZED. AND ANY TO ANY DISCUSSIONS THAT YOU HAD ABOUT FOCUSING ON CONFIDENCE RATHER THAN THE OUR THE REQUIREMENT AS A STANDARD. WE'RE LOOKING FOR LEADERSHIP IN OTHER AREAS BEFORE EXPLORING THOSE TYPES OF TOPICS. AND WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU EXAMINED THAT SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS THAT WHAT YOU SAID AS A REQUIREMENT. HAVE YOU DONE ANY KIND OF EXAMINATION OF THE EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS TO SEE IF THEY'RE STILL CURRENT AND APPROPRIATE. WE DID IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE LOWERED. OUR COSMETOLOGY HOURS FROM. EIGHTEEN TO SIXTEEN HUNDRED AND TWO THOUSAND I'M SORRY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. AND IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE LOWERED OUR AESTHETICS HOURS IN OUR HAIR DESIGN HOURS. ARE SIX HOURS WE WERE REDUCED BY THREE HUNDRED HOURS. AND THE E. AESTHETICS BY TWO I'M SORRY IN THE HAIR DESIGN BY TWO HUNDRED HOURS. GOOD TO MY AT. CO CHAIR. SLOW ANY QUESTIONS I HEAR MUCH SIMILARLY AS A- FOR THE PREVIOUS CONVERSATION ABOUT ANY OBSERVATIONS IDEA OF SIMILAR SET UP A CHALLENGES WITH THAT TYPE OF DEMOGRAPHICS ASSUME IN IN ABOUT A- OF LOVE LICENSEES. A MOVE WHICH THE CHALLENGES OF THE CHALLENGES OF THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF QUESTIONS EARLIER MY BY MY APOLOGIES WAS WITH RESPECT TO LANGUAGE BARRIERS AND THE TYPE OF COMMUNITIES. TYPICALLY WITHIN THIS INDUSTRY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PREDOMINATELY THAT OF BEING OF ASIAN DESCENT AND MIGHT YOU SEE ANY SPECIFIC CHALLENGES WITH RESPECT TO LICENSURE AND THAT OF THE STATE IN NEVADA. GIVEN THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF BEERS COMMUNITIES. WE ARE VERY DIVERSE GROUP. WELL I'M BRANCHED OUT OF LAS VEGAS AND THERE WAS AN ARTICLE THAT CAME OUT BELIEVE IN USA TODAY THAT SAYS LAS VEGAS IS WHAT AMERICA CAN EXPECT TO LOOK LIKE IN TWENTY FIFTY WE'RE VERY DIVERSE THAN ABOUT A STEEPLE COSMETOLOGY STAFFS FOR VERY DIVERSE. I GO THROUGH MY DAY I CAN BE IN MEETINGS SPEAKING FIVE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES BECAUSE OUR STAFF CAN SPEAK KOREAN VIETNAMESE CHINESE AND SPANISH. IN OUR TESTS ARE AVAILABLE IN THAT LINK IN ALL THOSE LANGUAGES AS WELL. AND WE'RE WORKING TIRELESSLY TO MAKE SURE ANY OF OUR INFORMATION THAT WE PRESENT. IN ENGLISH IS GOING TO BE IN THOSE SAME LANGUAGES. MEET ME OF A MY SISTER MAY KEEP MANY MORE CLARIFIED AND THAT'S THE BECAUSE THE QUESTION WHICH IS. ARE THERE SOME UNIQUE CHALLENGES SPECIFICALLY TO THE ASIAN COMMUNITY THAT AND SINCE YOU. MENTIONED THAT THIS IS THE PREDOMINANT DEMOGRAPHIC OF OTHER LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH TWO OTHER UNIQUE CHALLENGES TO THIS COMMUNITY. WOULD GIVE IN YOUR ROLE IN THE STATE OF NEVADA. OUR OUR UNIQUE CHALLENGE WOULD BE THAT WE HAVE A GROWING DIVERSE POPULATION. IN OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTES ARE NOT OFFERING. THE EDUCATION NEEDED IN THE LANGUAGE THAT ARE. OUR NEW RESIDENTS NEED. AND IS THAT THAT THAT'S ONLY THE THIS IS THE SOLE OBSERVATION THAT YOU WOULD MAKEGIVING YOUR CAPACITY OF THE DEMOGRAPHICS UNLESS THERE'S A SPECIFIC AREA THAT YOU WOULD LIKE FOR ME TO. HAVE IT JUST TO ME THAT THE RIGHT AS A NEW IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY THAT THERE MAY BE LANGUAGE ASPECTS ISSUES ON WITH THE ACCESS TO LICENSURE MAY BE SINCE YOU'RE SEEING CERTAIN TRENDS WITH RESPECT TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING MAYBE SEEING GARNISHES A WAGES WHICH THEFT WHAT ARE THOSE TYPE OF THINGS THAT I THINK MIGHT DISPROPORTIONATELY HURT THESE RECENT IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. GIVEN THE TYPE OF CHALLENGES THAT EXIST. WAIT IF ANY IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY NEED TO BE THAT THAT THERE IS ONE BUT ONE THAT MIGHT STAND OUT. THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE THAT I I'M EXPERIENCING IS THE EDUCATIONAL. THE LANGUAGE BARRIER AT THE EDUCATIONAL COMPONENT AS THEY NEED TO TREAT BEFORE THEY TRANSITION INTO THE STATE'S OUR ARENA OF OBTAINING THAT LICENSE IS THE DIFFICULTY PRIOR TO THAT LICENSING STATUS BECAUSE ONCE THEY REACH US. ON TO FIND OUT THEIR LICENSING MEANS WE CATER TO THE MEN AND THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE THAT THEY DESIRE SO ANY AREA THAT THE EXPERIENCE IS BY. NOT STATE CITIZEN OF OURS STATE RESIDENT ISSUE IT'S THAT NEWLY RESIDENTS ISSUE WITH WHATEVER'S EXISTING BEYOND STATE INSIDE THAT INDUSTRY THREE TO JUST LIKE LANGUAGE ACCESS IS WHAT YOU WOULD THAT LANGUAGE BARRIERS. IN SUMMARY LANGUAGE LANGUAGE IT IS THE GREATEST CHALLENGE FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE IN IN THE NEVADA JURISDICTION BECAUSE WE DO NOT OFFER THE PROGRAMS. I AM I AM UNAWARE OF A SCHOOL THAT OFFERS THE PROGRAMS IN LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'RE GONNA GO TO MISTER SHADE FOR JUST A MOMENT LET ME ASK A FINAL QUESTION TO YOU BOTH. THE UNLICENSED SIDE OF THIS INDUSTRY. DO YOU YOU COULD EITHER YOU SPEAK TO WHAT YOU KNOW OF THE ON LICENSE. FOLKS DOING THIS IN THE NEVADA OR AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT MR A HIGGINBOTHAM YOU WANNA START THEIR TEACH YOU KNOW. WHO WHO'S PRACTICING IN YOUR STATE THAT DOESN'T HAVE A LICENSE. WE HAVE TEAMS TO MONITOR SOCIAL NETWORKS AND IF THERE ARE ADVERTISEMENTS AND THAT INDIVIDUAL IS NOT LICENSED. THEN WE SEND THEM A NAME. CITATION PRETTY MUCH AND THEY'LL HAVE TO PAY THAT CITATION. IF THEY DON'T COOPERATE BY REMOVING THAT THEN WE GET LOCAL AUTHORITIES INVOLVED WITH THAT. OR WE FOUND. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE BEEN LAS VEGAS IS FULL OF H. AWAY SO. HM WAYS ARE A GREAT PLACE FOR US TO SAY HEY THERE'S A NON AUTHORIZED BUSINESS OPERATING IN YOU GET A COMMUNITY. THAT TYPE OF ISSUE. HELPS US. TACKLE AND LICENSE ACTIVITY AND YOU HAVE A SENSE OF WHETHER IT'S BEEN GOING UP GOING DOWN. AND NUMBERS TO FOLKS WHO ARE PRACTICING. WITHOUT A LICENSE AND YOUR STAGE OF ANY IN ANY SENSE OF THAT. NO THEY'RE GETTING. THEY'RE GETTING SMARTER WITH OTHER ADVERTISING ON SOCIAL NETWORKS SO. OKAY AND WHAT ABOUT DATA AND OTHER STATES NATIONALLY I AM OBVIOUSLY AND LICENSE TO A PRACTICES AN ISSUE IN EVERY STATE I WOULD CLARIFY TO SAY THAT AND LICENSE DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN AN EDUCATED. AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW IN YOUR OWN NUMBERS CERTAINLY IN LARGE NUMBER PEOPLE DON'T PASS EXAMS EVERY YEAR DOESN'T MEAN THEY-DON'T PRACTICE IT JUST MEANS THEY DON'T RETURN TO TRY TO PASS THE EXAM THE SECOND TIME SO IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE EQUIVALENT OF NOT BEING EDUCATED THEY MAY JUST NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO. PASSED THE EXAM REQUIRED AND THAT COULD BE A LANGUAGE BARRIER OR SOME OTHER ISSUE BUT IT ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE NUMBER ONE WAY THAT UNLICENSED WORKERS ARE DISCOVERED IS THROUGH HUMAN TRAFFICKING INVESTIGATIONS SO THIS ISN'T INDUSTRY WITH. I'M NOT A SURPRISE ANY OF YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT THERE'S A LOT OF LARGE NUMBER OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS THE SENATE STRING AND IT'S VERY HARD FOR REGULATORS ON INSPECTORS TO DETERMINE WHERE THAT'S OCCURRING AND I OFTENTIMES STATES FIND THAT OUT THROUGH. FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS FBI THAT TYPE OF THING IF THROUGH HUMAN TRAFFICKING INVESTIGATIONS. YOU A DEBT PROVIDED SOME TESTIMONY EARLIER ABOUT INJURIES THAT HAVE COME FROM THESE TYPES OF FIVE PRACTICES THAT HAVE GONE BAD IS THERE ANY BREAKDOWN OF THOSE TYPES OF INJURIES BASED ON LICENSE ON LICENSE FOR DONE. SO I GET THAT QUESTION ALL THE TIME PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS DONE YOU KNOW WHAT IS THAT ANSWER SOMEBODY UNLESS THE PROBLEM WITH ALL OF THIS IS THAT IF YOU ARE NOT LICENSE IT'S A MATTER OF THE BOARD ANYMORE SO TO TRY TO. CORRAL THOSE NUMBERS AT TIMES YOU'VE ENTERED SOME ANOTHER. SITUATION IT'S NO LONGER. SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT. TO CALL THOSE NUMBERS. NOT GONNA HAVE THAT. ON THE BOTTOM TEAR AND CERTAINLY NOT THE ON LICENSE RECURSOS NUMBERS ARE REALLY HARD TO COME BY. AND WITH THAT WANT YOU TO STAND BY THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY SEE WE GO BACK TO MISTER SHADE FOR WE HAVE AN AUDIO CONNECTION THAT WERE. CAN BRING ON UP HERE THE ON THE LINE NOW SENATOR GLAZER AND ENSURE LOW THE BACK HERE IN THE AND CALIFORNIA CAN YOU CAN HEAR US. YES I CAN HEAR IT IT'S VERY FAINT BUT- I CAN HEAR A LITTLE BIT OKAY LET YOU CAN KEEP YOUR MOUTH CLOSE TO THE RECEIVER WE CAN HEAR YOU VERY WELL AND AGAIN SORRY FOR THE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES. AND WE WELCOME YOU TO BE TO BEGIN YOUR TESTIMONY AGAIN. SO. WHERE I LEFT OFF BEFORE OUR TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES WAS TALKING ABOUT ARE OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING CONSORTIUM THAT THE COUNCIL STATE GOVERNMENTS THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF STATE LEGISLATURES IN THE NATIONAL GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION HAS CONVENE OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS OF THAT INITIATIVE IS FUNDED BY A GRANT FROM THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. AND THERE SIXTEEN STATES THAT HAVE BEEN PARTICIPATING IN THE CONSORTIUM AND WITH THE BROAD GOALS OF HELPING THE STATE. TO ENSURE THAT EXISTING AND NEW REQUIREMENTS ARE OVERLY BROAD OR BURDENS RESTRICTIVE. AND THAT THEY DON'T CREATE UNNECESSARY BARRIERS TO LABOR MARKET ENTRY AND IN SECOND TO IMPROVE THE PORTABILITY AND RECIPROCITY PROVISIONS FOR OCCUPATIONS TO HEALTH PRACTITIONERS MOVED THEIR LICENSE ACROSS STATE LINES SO IF WE MOVE TO THE NEXT SLIDE WE CAN SEE ON THE MAP. THE PURPLE STATES ARE THERE IS AND ORIGINAL APPLICATION PROCESS OR ELEVEN STATES WERE ADMITTED TO JOIN THE CONSORTIUM AND THEN FIVE MORE WERE ADDED AT. A LATER DATE DUE TO SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING SO. SHE IS SHE HAS BEEN HEAVILY INVOLVED IN THIS WORK FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS HELPING THE STATE. TACKLE THIS COMPLEX ISSUE AND SO I HAVE JUST PULLED OUT FIVE HIGH LEVEL SCHEMES OR SOME TRENDS THAT WE'VE SEEN AMONG THE STATE AND THEN STAYED OUTSIDE OF THE CONSORTIUM AS WELL THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH. SO WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE THE FOR THE FIRST TRAINED I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IS TARGETED RFORM FOR SPECIFIC POPULATION. AND SO FOOD WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE WE CAN SEE THE FIRST POPULATION THAT WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF STATES REALLY PUT EMPHASIS ON. HIS MILITARY SPOUSES. SO THE MAIN. THE MAIN ISSUE HERE IS MILITARY SPOUSES DUE TO THEIR SPOUSES DEPLOYMENT OFTEN MOVE VERY FREQUENTLY. A LOT OF TIMES TO DIFFERENT BASES IN DIFFERENT STATES WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO. GET RE LICENSED UPON MOVING TO THE NEW STATE SO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN STATE ADOPT TO REMOVE THESE BARRIERS FOR MILITARY SPOUSES LICENSURE BY ENDORSEMENT WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY A STATE ISSUING A NEW PERMANENT LICENSE WITHOUT ANY KIND OF FURTHER TRAINING OR EXAMS. IF THE APPLICATION IS MOVING FROM A STATE WITH SIMILAR STANDARDS. TEMPORARY LICENSURE JUST ALLOWS A SPOUSE TO PRACTICE FOR A SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME WITHOUT FILLING ANY NEW REQUIREMENTS FINISHES FIRST THAT PERIOD OF TIME. AND AN EXPEDITED LICENSORS IS THE FAST PASS STORE FAST LANE WEARS THEM THE STATE BOARD PROCESSING THE APPLICATION WILL PRIORITIZE THE SPOUSES. APPLICATION IN OFTEN. I PASSING A LOT OF THE STEPS REQUIRED FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC. AND THEN LASTLY EXEMPTION THE FOUR STATES ARIZONA FLORIDA ISLAND UTAH HAS JUST SAID MILITARY SPOUSES DO NOT NEED TO GO TO THE LICENSING PROCESS IN THE NEW STATE THEIR PREVIOUS OLD STATES LICENSE WILL BE RECOGNIZED. IN THE NEW STATE SO HERE'S ON A FLORIDA AND IOWA YOU DO NOT HAVE TO GET RE LICENSED IF YOU ARE AN MILITARY ABOUT. THEY'LL RECOGNIZE THAT OLD LICENSE SO WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE WE CAN SEE SOME STATS ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S SO SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY SPOUSES IN CALIFORNIA. THERE'S A COUPLE PROVISIONS THIS IS BASED ON THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA STUDY WHO DID A FIFTY STATE AUDIT OF LICENSING BOARDS AND HOW THEY PROCESS MILITARY SPOUSE APPLICATIONS. SO WE CAN SEE A COUPLE BILLS HERE THAT ARE PERMITTED TO MILITARY SPOUSES THAT REQUIRE EXPEDITED LICNSURE IN THE IN. AB NE EIGHTY SIX WHICH I FORGOT THE DAY BUT AS IT WAS TWENTY FOURTEEN REQUIRED TEMPORARY LICENSURE. SO THOSE TWO THINGS ARE IN PLACE FOR MILITARY SPOUSES. THE UNIVERSITY MINNESOTA'S STUDY THE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY WORD TO EXPAND THE THOSE TWO BILLS AND ALLOW AND AN ENDORSEMENT PROCESS AS WELL FOR SPOUSES. AND IT'S ALSO ENCOURAGE BOARD STAFF TO IMPROVE THEIR UNDERSTANDING AND APPLICATION OF THESE BILLS I GUESS THERE IS A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE LAW IN WHAT IS BEING PRACTICED BY THE STATE BOARD. THAT'S MILITARY SPOUSES WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE ANOTHER SPECIFIC POPULATION OF FOLKS THAT WE SEEN A LOT OF MOVEMENT. IN THIS AREA OF REGULATION REFORM IS WITH PEOPLE WITH CRIMINAL RECORDS. SO THE MAIN BARRIER HERE IS A LOT OF LICENSING STATUTES CONTAIN LANGUAGE THAT ARE SOMEONE WITH A CRIMINAL RECORD FROM GETTING A STATE LICENSE SO IT MIGHT HAVE A FELONY BLANKET BAN OR FOR CERTAIN MISDEMEANORS IT WILL SAY THE BOARD EITHER SHALL OR MAY. DENY LICENSURE FOR THESE FOLKS SO HERE'S SOME SOME DIFFERENT POLICY OPTIONS THAT WE'VE SEEN STATES PURSUE SO LIMITATIONS ON TYPE OF CONVICTIONS CONSIDERED THIS IS ESSENTIALLY JUST. LIMITING THE CONVICTIONS THAT A BOARD MAY CONSIDER NGUYEN DENYING FOR LICENSURE SO MAYBE JUST THEY WOULD JUST DENY FOR VIOLENT CRIMES OR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO IT'S- NARROWING THE SCOPE. AND NOT BEING AS AS BROAD AN ALL ENCOMPASSING. LIMITATION BASED ON TIME SINCE CONVICTION SO THAT SET THE TIME PERIOD USUALLY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIVE AND TEN YEARS THAT TELLS THE LICENSING BOARD IF THE CRIME OCCURRED. BEYOND THIS SET AMOUNT OF TIME THEN THE BOARD CAN NOT CONSIDER IT AND THEIR THEIR- APPLICATION WERE YOU. DIRECT RELATIONSHIP REQUIREMENTS THAT ESSENTIALLY IS MANDATING THAT THE BOARD PROOF THAT THERE IS A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CONVICTION IN THE LICENSE THAT YOUR YOU THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE APPLYING FOR INDIVIDUALIZED CONSIDERATION THIS IS ESSENTIALLY. ESTABLISHING A METHODOLOGY OR CRITERIA FOR BOARD TO THAT THEY'RE THEY HAVE TO CONSIDER WHEN THEY'RE REVIEWING A SOMEONE WITH A CRIMINAL RECORD THEIR LICENSE APPLICATION AND AGAIN ALL OF THESE ARE ESSENTIALLY JUST TRYING TO NARROW THE SCOPE TO THE INDIVIDUAL AND NOT MAKE BROAD BLANKET STATEMENTS THAT WOULD PROHIBIT CERTAIN PEOPLE WHO WHO MAY HAS BEEN COMPLETELY REHABILITATED AND PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY AND WE WOULD MAKE A GREAT LICENSE THE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO HELP THE BOARD BECOME MORE NARROW IN TAILORED IN SPECIFIC WITH THE REVIEWS SO THAT. EVERYONE IS NOT BARRED FROM LICENSURE. PRELIMINARY ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION THAT'S ONE WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF STATES PURSUE KNOW THAT AS THE EXAMPLE THAT I SAY HERE. AND THAT'S ESSENTIALLY THE INDIVIDUAL WITH THE RECORD CAN PETITION THE BOARD AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE APPLICATION PROCESS TO SEE IF THERE'S A CONVICTION THAT WOULD PROHIBIT HIM FROM RECEIVING A LICENSE SO. IT HELPS THEM ON THE FRONT END SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS IN GET ALL THIS TRAINING AND DO ALL THIS EXPERIENCE ONLY AT THE VERYEND OF THE PROCESS TO FIND OUT. THAT THEY HAVE BEEN DENIED SO IT TELLS AND AT AT THE VERY ONSET AT THE FRONT OF THE APPLICATION PROCESS WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE A CONVICTION THAT WOULD PROHIBIT THEM FROM ACHIEVING THE LICENSE. AND THEN WRITTEN NOTICE OF THE NILE THIS REQUIRES THE BOARD TO SAY YOU KNOW PRECISELY WHY THEY DENIED AND NOT NOT JUST TELL SOMEONE THAT THEY WERE DENIED IN USE FAKE LANGUAGE BUT AS SAY EXACTLY PRECISELY. WHAT THE REASONING FOR THAT WAS. FIVE FOODS SO THOSE ARE SOME OF POLICY OPTIONS THAT WE SEEN. FOR PRE PEOPLE WITH CRIMINAL RECORDS. ON THE NEXT SLIDE OUR OUR LAST KIND OF TARGET POPULATION THAT WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF STATES FOCUS ON. IS IMMIGRANTS IN FOREIGN TRAINED APPLICANTS IN IN ONE THING I HIGHLIGHT HERE FROM UTAH. IS THE USE OF COMPETENCY BASED ASSESSMENT SO THE MAIN THE MAIN BEER HERE FOR IMMIGRANTS IS A LOT OF TIMES LICENSING BOARDS DO NOT. RECOGNIZE TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE THAT SOMEONE HAS RECEIVED FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY SO THE CLASSIC EXAMPLE. OF THE YOU KNOW THE PHYSICIAN FROM INDIA WHO. DRIVING A CAB OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WE WANT TO HELP THESE FOLKS TO YOU. GET THEIR THEIR EXPERIENCE AND THEIR TRAINING RECOGNIZED FOR A STATE LICENSE HERE IN AMERICA SO UTAH HAS SAID TO THESE COMPETENCY BASED ASSESSMENT THAT WE'RE GONNA TRY TO MOVE AWAY FROM THESE TIME BASED. TIME SENSITIVE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS YOU KNOW A THOUSAND HOURS OR THREE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE OR- SOMETHING LIKE THAT AIM JUST PROVED TO US THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO THE TRADE THAT YOU'RE- THAT YOU'RE APPLYING. FOR THE FOR THE LICENSE SO H. B. TWO TWO SIX IS ESSENTIALLY ALLOWING UTAH'S.% LICENSING DEPARTMENT TO UTILIZE COMPETENCY BASED ASSESSMENTS RATHER THAN THESE THESE TIME BASED REQUIREMENTS WHICH WOULD REALLY HELP IMMIGRANTS BE ABLE TO PROVE THAT HE'S COMPETENT IN HIS AREA OFTRADE WITHOUT HAVING TO. GO THROUGH THE FULL LICENSURE PROCESS OVER AGAIN. ON THE NEXT SLIDE WE CAN SEE SOME OTHER STRATEGIES THAT WE'VE SEEN STATES PURSUE I THINK THE MOST POPULAR ONE JUST DEVELOPING AN IMMIGRANT LICENSING GUIDE THAT SECOND ONE IT'S REALLY LOW COST AND REALLY EASY. AND IS ESSENTIALLY JUST MAPPING OUT YOU KNOW WHAT DOES IT TAKE AS AN IMMIGRANT FOR YOU TO RECEIVE A STATE LICENSE AND YOU'RE GIVEN FIELD. A LOT OF TIMES ESPECIALLY IF ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE JUST THE WHOLE LICENSING PROCESS IN THE STRUCTURE IN THE STATE IS SO DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE THAT THEY JUST GIVE UP ON THE FRONT AND- AND DON'T PURSUE THAT SO IF THERE IF THERE IS LITERATURE AVAILABLE THAT WOULD. CLEARLY MAP OUT THE STEPS THAT IT TAKES TO RECEIVE A LICENSE IN THEIR GIVEN FIELD THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAY. AND ALSO YEAH ESTABLISHING BRIDGE PROGRAMS IN INVESTING IN. ENGLISH CLASSES AND THINGS LIKE THAT. SO THAT'S REALLY THAT'S THE FIRST TREND THAT WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF STATES PURSUE A THESE TARGET REFORMS FOR. SPECIFIC OCCUPY A SPECIFIC POPULATIONS OF FOLKS SO SPOUSES PEOPLE CRIMINAL RECORDS AND IMMIGRANTS. WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE THE SECOND TRENDS THAT I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT IS THIS CONCEPT OF UNIVERSAL LICENSE RECOGNITION SO WE MOVED TO THE NEXT SIDE WE CAN SEE THERE'S THREE STATES THAT CURRENTLY. HAVE UNIVERSAL RECOGNITION AND WHAT I MEAN BY UNIVERSAL RECOGNITION IS THEY WILL UNIVERSALLY EXCEPT IN OUT OF STATE. APPLE CAN THEY WILL RECOGNIZE THAT OUT OF STATE LICENSE SEE IF CERTAIN CRITERIA ARE MET. AND I WILL KNOW SO OUT OF THESE THREE PENNSYLVANIA MONTANA IN ARIZONA. ARIZONA IS THE ONLY ONE THAT DOESN'T HAVE A CLAUSE THAT REQUIRES THE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR SO THAT'S KEY BECAUSE IN MONTANA AND IN PENNSYLVANIA THEY HAVE THIS UNIVERSAL RECOGNITION THE LAW IN PLACE BUT IT STILL SAYS THAT YOUR OLD STATES REQUIREMENTS NEED TO BE. SIMILAR TO OURS AND LICENSING BOARD. WILL REVIEW TO ENSURE THAT THE REQUIREMENT TO SIMILAR. ZONA DOES NOT SAY THAT THEY THEY DO NOT CARE WHAT THE OLD STATES REQUIREMENTS WERE ALL THAT THEY CARE ABOUT IS THAT YOU'VE ESTABLISHED ARIZONA RESIDENCY AND PASS AN EXAM SO WE GO. TO THE NEXT SLIDE WE CAN SEE. WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR UNIVERSAL RECOGNITION UNDER THE ARIZONA MODEL SO ALL ALL YOU HAVE TO HAVE PROVEN IS THAT YOU ARE IN ARIZONA RESIDENTS. YOU'VE BEEN LICENSE FOR AT LEAST A YEAR IN YOUR OLD STATE. YOU COMPLETED ALL THE REQUIREMENTS IN THE ORIGINAL STATE. AND IN ANY ERA ZONA SPECIFIC EXAMS BEYOND THE LICENSING EXAMS SO THIS IS NOT TALKING ABOUT IF YOU'RE APPLYING TO BE A PLUMBER THIS IS NOT THE PLUMBING SAND. BUT ADDITIONAL EXAMS LIKE JURISPRUDENCE EXAMS OR IN AT THE EXAM OR ARE AN EXAM ON A ARIZONA SPECIFIC LOSS OF NOT A LICENSEE SAM BUT- AND OTHER ADDITIONAL EXAM WITH THAT. NO DISQUALIFYING CRIMINAL HISTORY IN AND PAY YOUR FEES SO THAT THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IN ARIZONA TO QUALIFY. AS AN OUT OF STATE APPLICATION TO RECEIVE AN ARIZONA LICENSE THAT WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF STATES THAT ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN THIS CONCEPT. I WILL NOTE. THAT IT'S MOSTLY LEGISLATORS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THIS AND PEOPLE IN THE REGULATORY COMMUNITY ARE NOT AS KEEN ON THIS IDEA. AND ALSO NOTE THAT THIS. STRUCTURE THIS UNIVERSAL LICENSE STRUCTURE DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH. EXISTING RECIPROCITY AGREEMENT SO IF. THERE IS AN INTERSTATE COMPACT IN THE PROFESSION OR AN EXISTING RECIPROCITY AGREEMENT THE UNIVERSAL RECOGNITION DOES NOT AFFECT THAT IN ANY WAY THIS IS JUST FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T ALREADY HAVE SOME SORT OF. A RECIPROCITY SYSTEM IN PLACE. THAT IS THE SECOND TRADE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT UNIVERSAL RECOGNITION THERE'S A LOT OF MEDIA COVERAGE ON THIS GOVERNOR DO YOU SEE AN ARIZONA. DROVE UP TO THE SIGNING OF THE BILL AND THE YOUTH AND THE U. HAUL TO SYMBOLIZING WE WANT PEOPLE TO MOVE TO ARIZONA. IN IN SO WE'RE GOING TO RECOGNIZE ALL THESE AT THE STATE LICENSEES THAT ARE APPLYING IN ARIZONA. FOR THE SURGERY AND I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IS. THE STATE A STAB MACHINE A SUNRISE AND SUNSET PROCESS. IN SO IT THIS IS SOMETHING I KNOW THAT THIS COMMITTEE IS CURRENTLY TASKED WITH IS HIS SON SETTING. THE SUNSET REVIEW FOR THE COSMETOLOGY BEAUTY LICENSING BOARDS SO TO YOU ON THE THIS SUNRISE AND IS A REVIEW BEFORE THE BREAK IT BEFORE CREATE ANY REGULATION SUNSET. IS IT STILL NEEDED AFTER THE REGULATION HAS BEEN HAS BEEN CREATED SO I DO NOT BELIEVE CALIFORNIA HAS SUNRISE PROVISION FOR LICENSING BOARDS BUT- OBVIOUSLY THERE IS A SUNSET PROVISION ALREADY IN PLACE. SO WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE WE CAN SEE SOME CRITERIA THAT STATES HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT FOR WINTER SUN RISE AND NEW BOARD TO INTRODUCE A NEW. REGULATION AND I PULLED THESE FROM VERMONT FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE THEY HAVE A REALLY ROBUST SUNRISE AND SUNSET. STRUCTURE IN THAT STATE AND SO THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT THEY ASK WHEN THEY SUNRISE A NEW BOARD SO IS THERE ON REGULATED PRACTICE. THAT CAN CLEARLY HARM ENDANGER THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE WELL AND OF. OR WELFARE OF THE PUBLIC AND IT'S NOT IT'S THE HARM IS RECOGNIZABLE IT'S NOT REMOTE IT'S NOT SPECULATIVE. AND THAT THE PUBLIC CAN BE REASONABLY BENEFITTED OF ASSURANCE OF INITIAL AND CONTINUING PROFESSIONAL ABILITY AND THERE'S NO OTHER LESS RESTRICTIVE MEANS BY WHICH THE PUBLIC CAN BE PROTECTED SO SOMETHING LIKE A CERTIFICATION. OR REGISTRATION OR MAYBE INSURANCE OR BONDING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. ON THE NEXT SLIDE WE CAN SEE SUNSET CRITERIA SO THIS IS WHAT FOR MINE THE QUESTIONS THEY ASK WHEN SUN SETTING ABOARD. IT IS STILL IN THE INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC IN FILLING IN FOR LEGISLATIVE INTENT THEY THINK ABOUT COST SCOPE OF REGULATIONS SO DOES THE AMOUNT OF TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE THAT WE'RE REQUIRING IT IS ACT HE COOL TO THE POTENTIAL HARM. ARE THE REQUIREMENTS CONSISTENT WITH PUBLIC INTEREST IS. AT THE SIDE PUBLIC OPINION EFFECTIVENESS AND COMPLAIN SO ALL THESE THINGS ARE THINGS THAT THEY'RE CONSIDERING WHEN THEY SUNSET ABOARD. AND SO WE MOVED TO THE NEXT SIDE WE CAN SEE SEVERAL STATES THAT HAS INTRODUCED THESE SUNSET PROCESSES JUST THIS PAST LEGISLATIVE SESSION WE SEEN THE BRASS CAM LOUISIANA HEIAU. AND THEY HAVE COMMITTED TO EXAMINING A FRACTION OF THEIR LICENSING BOARDS EACH EACH YEAR IN NEBRASKA'S EXAMPLE TO ONE FIFTH EVERY FIVE YEARS SO ALL THE BOARDS GET EXAMINED OCE EVERY FIVE YEARS. THEY MUST PROVE THAT THERE IS PRESENT SIGNIFICANT SUBSTANTIATED HARM AND THEY'RE ALSO REQUIRED TO CONSIDERED THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE MEANS OF REGULATIONS. FIRST BEFORE THEY MOVE ON TO FULL LICENSURE. AND IT'S INTERESTING THE OHIO BILL ACTUALLY. NOTE THAT THE BOARDS WILL EXPIRE EVERY SIX YEARS UNLESS THEY'RE EXPLICITLY RENEWED BY LAWMAKERS SO IT'S REQUIRING LEGISLATORS TO TAKE THAT ACTIVE STEP TO RENEW THE BOARD AND IF THEY DON'T IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY EXPIRE. FIVE SO THAT IS THE THIRD AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE MOVE TO THE NEXT SLIDE THE FORCE CHANGING REGULATORY STRUCTURE. SO WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT HERE. EACH STAGE STRUCTURES THEIR LICENSING BOARDS VERY DIFFERENTLY SOME STATES. LIKE CALIFORNIA HAVE A CENTRALIZED SYSTEM WHERE THERE'S AND IN UMBRELLA AGENCY THAT HOUSES ALL OF THEIR BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. OTHER STATES THE BOARDS ARE COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT AND THEY HAVE THEIR OWN RULE MAKING AUTHORITY THEY HAVE THEIR OWN FEE STRUCTURES SEPARATE FROM OTHER LICENSING BOARDS THEIR THEIR INDEPENDENCE. AN AUTONOMOUS. AND SO WE'VE SEEN A IN THE WAKE OF NORTH CAROLINA DENTAL CASE THAT WENT TO THE SUPREME COURT. THAT ESTABLISHED THAT LICENSING BOARDS MUST HAVE ACTIVE STATE SUPERVISION FROM A NEUTRAL STATE ENTITY ARE WE SEEING A LOT OF STATE TO MOVE AWAY FROM THIS AUTONOMOUS STRUCTURE IN A INTO A CENTRALIZED STRUCTURE SO WE SEEN. IT IT IT ALL STEMS FROM THIS THIS NEED TO ESTABLISH ACTED STAYS SUPERVISION SO LICENSING BOARDS ARE AFRAID THAT IF THEY REMAIN AUTONOMOUS AND INDEPENDENT. THAT AN ACTION THAT THEY TAKE AGAINST THE LICENSEE MIGHT BE CONSIDERED A VIOLATION OF THE ANTI TRUST LAW AND THEY COULD BE PERSONALLY HELD LIABLE. THAT THAT BIG RULING FROM THAT NORTH CAROLINA CASES WELL IS THAT THE BOARD THE BOARD MEMBERS AND OF CAN INDIVIDUALLY HE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR ACTIONS TAKEN ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD AND- WE SEE A LOT OF STATE. TRYING TO PROTECT THEMSELVES BY ESTABLISHING THIS ACTIVE STATE. SUPERVISION A WITH WOULD BE. ALSO INTERESTED IN CENTRALIZING JUST FOR IT MINISTRY TO PURPOSES SO GROUP BEING AGENCIES TOGETHER AND BROAD FUNCTIONAL AREAS CREATING A CONNIE'S OF SCALE AND ESTABLISHING JUST A FEW DEPARTMENTS RATHER THAN ALL OF THESE INDEPENDENT BOARDS WHO ARE KIND OF YOU KNOW OUT ON THEIR OWN. SO IF WE MOVE TO THE NEXT SLIDE WE CAN SEE THIS COMES FROM THE COUNCIL OF LICENSURE ENFORCEMENT AND REGULATION CLEAR IT CREATED THIS MODEL STRUCTURE OF HOW STATE BOARDS ARE SET UP SO WE CAN SEE MODEL A AT THE TOP. COMPLETELY AUTONOMOUS AND IN MODEL HE AT THE VERY BOTTOM WHERE THERE'S A CENTRAL AGENCY THAT HAS COMPLETE AUTHORITY AND BOARDS ARE ARE YOU ADVISORY ONLY SO STATES ARE FALLING SOMEWHERE IT'S NOT AS RIGID AS THEIR INDEPENDENCE OR DEPENDENT BUT THERE'S KIND OF THIS SPECTRUM. THAT THAT BOARDS ARE FALLING UNDER. IN THEIR THEIR REGULATORY STRUCTURE. UNTIL WE MOVED TO THE NEXT SLIDE WE CAN SEE SOME SPECIFIC. REFORMS THAT STATES HAVE DONE THE PAST YEARS SO COMBINING SIMILAR OCCUPATIONS UNDER AN UMBRELLA BOARD SO THAT WOULD BE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE TAKING THE COSMETOLOGY BOARD. IN THE BARBERING BOARD AT THOSE RISKS SEPARATING CREATING ONE SINGLE UMBRELLA BOARD SO PURSUING THAT IDEAL CENTRALIZATION THERE. KENTUCKY IT IS IN THERE ATTEMPTING TO CENTRALIZE ALL OF THEIR LICENSING BOARD. UNDERNEATH ONE CABINET. MISSISSIPPI IN OKLAHOMA AND ESTABLISHED COMMISSIONS THAT ARE ARE REGULARLY REVIEWING BOARD SO THAT THEY HAD THAT THAT ACTIVE STATE SUPERVISION. THAT WE TALKED ABOUT. FROM THE NORTH CAROLINA DENTAL CASE. BUT THAT IS THE FOURTH TREND IF WE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE. FIFTH AND FINAL TREND THAT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THAT STATES ARE VERY INTERESTED IN IS THE INTERSTATE COMPACT SO THE ISSUE HERE IT GOES BACK TO THE MOBILITY ISSUE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT WITH UNIVERSAL RECOGNITION HOW DO WE HELP. PRACTITIONERS MOVE ACROSS STATE LINES MORE SEAMLESSLY WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE FULL LICENSURE PROCESS OVER AGAIN. SO WHAT IS AN INTERSTATE COMPACT ESSENTIALLY IT IS AN AGREEMENT A FORMAL CONTRACT BETWEEN STATE. THAT THEY ENTER INTO THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND IT'S BINDING IT BINDS STATES TOGETHER INTO AN AGREEMENT TO SAY THAT THERE JOINT LEAD GOING TO DO SOMETHING TOGETHER SO WE'VE SEEN. A LOT OF STATES PURSUE THESE FOR OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING RECIPROCITY. A IN THE COUNCIL STATE GOVERNMENT HAS A PARTICULAR EXPERTISE AN INTERSTATE COMPACT BECAUSE WE ARE ACTUALLY HOME TO THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR INTERSTATE COMPACT HERE AT CSG IT'S A POLICY PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE. WHERE WE ASSIST PROFESSIONS IN STATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT IN THE MAINTENANCE OF INTERSTATE COMPACTS ONCE THEY'RE AS STAB LIST. SO WE'RE THE ONLY INFORMATION CLEARINGHOUSE AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDER. ON INTERSTATE CONTACTS IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY. BUT IF WE MOVE TO THE NEXT SLIDE WE CAN SEE. HERE OUR THE ACTIVE INTERSTATE COMPACT ON THE LEFT SIDE SO THERE ARE CONTACTS IN PLACE FOR NURSING FOR MEDICINE FOR POSITIONS EMS COMPACT IS FOR EMS PROFESSIONALS. PHYSICAL THERAPY SIDE PACKED IS FOR PSYCHOLOGY AND SPECIFICALLY DEALS WITH TELL US PSYCHOLOGY. AND THEN IT BANS PRACTICE NURSING SO WE HAVE SEEN A LARGE NUMBER OF PROFESSIONS EXPRESSED INTEREST IN DEVELOPING THESE YOU CAN SEE ON THE RIGHT SIDE THESE ARE THE PROFESSIONS THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY. IN THE PROCESS WITH THE SPEECH THERAPY AND AUDIOLOGY COMPACT IS FINISHED AND FINALIZED AND WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR PASSAGE AND LEGISLATORS AND TWENTY TWENTY. WE'RE WORKING WITH THE DENTAL COMMUNITY ON DENTAL HYGIENE POSITION SAYS AND T. A LICENSED PROFESSIONAL. LICENSED PROFESSIONAL. COUNSELORS AND LASTLY TEACHERS SO. WE SEE THIS BE A VERY EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR ACHIEVING RECIPROCITY AMONG STATES YOU CAN SEE THE NURSE LICENSE OR CONTACT AS THIRTY FOUR STATES THAT ARE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THAT CONTACT SO IF YOU ARE IF YOU LIVE IN A COMPACT STATE. ESSENTIALLY ACTS AS A IS SIMILAR TO A DRIVER'S LICENSE WHERE YOU CAN PRACTICE IN ANY OTHER STATE THAT PARTICIPATES IN THE COMPACT WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH AND- GO THROUGH THE ROOF THE RELATIONSHIP PROCESS SO IT'S SEAMLESS YOU CAN JUST CROSS STATE LINES AND- CONTINUE TO PRACTICE WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH. THAT BURDENSOME PROCESS OF RE APPLYING TO THE BOARD AND IN WAITING FOR YOUR APPLICATION BE ACCEPTED AND PAYING THE THIS ON THESE UNITS TO GO ACROSS STATE LINES LIKE. YOU WOULD IF YOU WERE DRIVING A CAR ACROSS STATE LINES. AND WE SEE AN INTEREST IN THESE DISTRICTS BLOATING OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WE EXPECT THE NURSE LICENSURE CONTACT TO CONTINUE TO GAIN MOMENTUM AND WILL PROBABLY. BE ABOVE FORTY STATE HERE WITH HER VERY SOON. SO THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE HAS OFFICIALLY ENDORSED INTERSTATE COMPACT IS REALLY THE GOLD STANDARD FOR ESTABLISHING LICENSE RECIPROCITY. THESE LIKE PIECEMEAL RECIPROCITY AGREEMENTS ARE TEMPORARY SOLUTIONS BUT INTERSTATE COMPACT OR SEEN AS REALLY THE MAIN IS THAT THE GOLD STANDARD FOR ACHIEVING LICENSE RECIPROCITY. SO IF WE MOVE TO THE NEXT SLIDE I APOLOGIZE I'M NOT SURE HOW WELL THIS TEXT WILL SHOW UP BUT YOU CAN SEE THE PARTICIPATING STATES AND ALL THE CONTACT. IN THE WHITE STATE ARE STATES THAT DO NOT PRACTICE IN ANY OF THE CONTACTING SEE CALIFORNIA HAS NOT ENTERED INTO ANY OF THESE AGREEMENTS. AND THE DARKER STATES ARE THE ONES THAT PARTICIPATE IN MORE SO THERE ARE THERE'S NO STATES THAT PARTICIPATE IN ALL OF THEM SO IT'S A VARIETY OF. KIND OF RANGES THE SPECTRUM FOR HOW STATES ARE UTILIZING THESE SO. EACH INTERSTATE COMPACT IS REALLY DIFFERENT THIS IS NOT MODEL LEGISLATION THIS IS NOT YOU KNOW A PURSE PRESCRIPTIVE PROCESS BUT- WE REALLY TRY TO BE COLLABORATIVE AS COLLABORATIVE AS POSSIBLE AND BRINGING PEOPLE ROM ALL OVER THE PROFESSION. AND POLICY MAKERS FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. TOGETHER TO JOINTLY. DALGLISH THE THESE COMPACT SO THAT NO ONE STATE CAN SAY YOU KNOW I WASN'T A PART OF HELPING DRAFT THIS WE REALLY LIKE TO BRING A DIVERSE GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER WHEN MAKING THESE SO. WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE THAT IS ALL THAT I HAVE I'M NOT SURE. IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE THEM NOW OR IF WE MOVE ONE MORE SLIDE MY CONTACT INFORMATION. AND I'LL JUST NOTE THAT U. R. L. THE BOTTOM LICENSING DOT C. S. T. AT WORK THAT'S A WEBSITE THAT HOUSES ALL OF OUR OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING WORK THAT WE PRODUCE LOTS OF REPORTS. DIFFERENT POLICY BRIEF. THERE IS A DATABASE ON THERE THAT HAS LICENSING REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL FIFTY STATE. SO WE TOOK THIRTY FOUR DIFFERENT PROFESSIONS AND MAPPED OUT THE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL FIFTY STATES SO YOU COULD DO A COMPARISON. TO SEE HOW CALIFORNIA RANGE VERSUS NEIGHBORING STATES OR THE WHOLE REGION OVER THE WHOLE COUNTRY WHATEVER YOU'RE INTERESTED IN SO THAT'S A VERY USEFUL TOOL AS WELL. SO I WILL STOP THERE AND SEE IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS THAT I COULD POTENTIALLY ANSWER NOT SURE HOW WELL BE ABLE TO HEAR THEM BUT- DRY. SO MATTER CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AB VERY INFORMATIVE I THINK YOU STIMULATED A LOT OF FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS A FEW OF WHICH I MASS TODAY BUT YEARS CERTAINLY A GREAT RESOURCE FOR A WHAT IS HAPPENING AROUND THE COUNTRY IN THIS IN THIS AREA YOU KNOW I'M TRYING TO WRESTLE WITH THAT THE SLIDE THAT YOU SHOWED AT THE END WHERE THESE INTERSTATE COMPACTS SHOWS CALIFORNIA HAS A- HAS REALLY HAD. NOT ENTERED INTO ANY OF THEM. AND THE YOU KNOW THE AD EVERYBODY WILL HAVE A REASON FOR THAT BUT CERTAINLY. AT THE HEART. OF THE OF THAT IS A CONCERN THAT THE STANDARDS THAT HAVE BEEN APPLIED IN THOSE PLACES. FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY. ARE ADEQUATE FOR US. AND THIS IS THAT THIS IS A CHALLENGE WE WE'VE SENT OUT A LITTLE BIT TIME OR EARLIER IN THIS HEARING AND ROUGH YOU COULD LISTEN AND HER COULD HEAR AND- TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT STANDARDS AROUND THE COUNTRY FOR TRAINING AND EDUCATION. DO YOU HAVE ANY BROAD OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THAT ISSUE OF HEALTH AND SAFETY AND THEN HOUSE OF MANY STATES ARE INTERPRETING THIS IMPORTANT QUESTION SO DIFFERENTLY. SURE SO I THINK I GOT THE GIST OF YOUR QUESTION SO IF YOU NOTICE ON. ON THE SLIDE THAT THAT SHOWS WHICH PROFESSIONS HAVE HAVE ESTABLISHED THESE INTERSTATE COMPACTS. ALL OF THEM ARE IN AND HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONS AND THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT AND CONTACTS REALLY THRIVE ON UNIFORMITY SO UNIFORMITY OF REQUIREMENTS MAINLY. SO LET IT FROM OUR. WHEN WE DEVELOP THESE CONTACTS WE ESTABLISH A UNIVERSAL STANDARD FOR PRACTICE SO YOU'RE NOT SAYING THAT YOU ARE ACCEPTING ARIZONA STANDARDS BUT THE COMPACT ITSELF IS CREATING A NEW STANDARD THAT STATES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO HEAR TO IN SOME OF THE STATES WILL HAVE TO RAISE THE BAR TO ENTER INTO THE COMPACT. IN THE STATE'S MIGHT HAVE TO LOWER THEIR BAR TO ENTER INTO THE CONTACT BUT HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONS WE'VE SEEN ARE FAIRLY UNIFORM ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND THEIR LICENSING REQUIREMENTS OF WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A NURSE IN CALIFORNIA IS TYPICALLY WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A NURSE IN IN MOST OTHER STATES SO THAT YOU KNOW BACHELOR'S DEGREE PASSING THE AND COLLECT. AND IN HAVING SOME SORT OF FELLOWSHIP OR ASSISTANTSHIP SO IN THE SAME FOR THE MEDICAL LICENSE OR COMPACT IN PHYSICAL THERAPY THESE ARE ALL PROFESSIONS WHERE STANDARD TO PRACTICE IS PRETTY UNIFORM ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND THE DIFFERENCES ARE. ARE MORE MENIAL I WILL NOTE SO I HAVE. TEACHERS UNDER. CONTACTS AND DEVELOPMENT STAGE THAT'S ONE PROFESSION IS THAT THAT IS CERTAINLY AN OUT LIAR ON THIS LIST THE ALL THE OTHER PROFESSIONS ARE ARE HEALTH CARE. BUT TEACHERS THAT THAT'LL BE. A DIFFICULT CONTACT TO ESTABLISH BECAUSE THE STANDARDS ARE ARE SO VASTLY DIFFERENT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND BECAUSE SO MANY THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT TRACKS TO BECOMING A TEACHER I TO BE VERY HARD TO ESTABLISH ONE SINGLE STANDARD. THAT STATES WILL IT HERE TOO WHEN THEY ENTER INTO THE COMPACT SO THAT'S HOW I WOULD RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION IS THAT COMPAQ'S REALLY THRIVE ON UNIFORMITY AND THAT'S WHY. THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONS THAT HAVE PURSUED THESE IS BECAUSE- THEY HAVE RELATIVE UNIFORMITY. AND THEIR LICENSING REQUIREMENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND SO MATT IS IT NAIVE OF ME TO RAISE THE QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THE COMPLEXITY THAT GOES INTO BEING A NURSE. IS HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE COMPLEXITY THAT GOES INTO BEING ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF SOMEONE'S NAILS. SORRY I MISSED THE LAST PART OF THAT QUESTION LINE AYE AYE AYE YEAH I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WITHIN THE COSMETOLOGY. AND BARBERING AREAS THAT WHY WE'RE FAILING TO COME UP WITH A REASONABLE STANDARDS IS IT. AND I GUESS IT WAS A- A YOU KNOW SOMEONE SUGGEST THAT BEING A NURSE IS SOMEWHAT MORE COMPLEX. IN TRAINING AND EDUCATION AND SAFETY THAN THAN ONE MIGHT. NEEDED TO TAKE CARE OF SOMEONE'S NAILS. YOUR HAIR ANY OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THAT. SURE SO YEAH I MEAN SO FOR NURSING I MEAN IT'S- THE STANDARD ACROSS THE COUNTRY IS REALLY FOUR YEAR BACHELOR'S DEGREE AND PASSING THE AND COLLECTS THE NURSING EXAM SO THAT I THINK THAT'S A PRETTY YOU KNOW A FOUR YEAR DEGREE WHAT IS. I WOULD SAY THE HIGHER BAR THAN JUST A AS A SET NUMBER OF TRAINING HOURS IN IN BEAUTY SCHOOL. I DON'T BELIEVE FOR BARBERING IN COSMETOLOGY THERE'S ANY KIND OF EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS OTHER THAN THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF HOURS IN BEAUTY SCHOOL THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE REQUIRED YOU. TO LOG SO A IN THAT I WILL SAY WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PROFESSIONS THAT HAVE UNIFORMITY. THIS IS CERTAINLY THE BEAUTY PROFESSIONS IN COSMETOLOGY IS CERTAINLY A INDUSTRY THAT DOES NOT HAVE UNIFORMITY THE GATE AND YOU CAN TELL BY THE DATABASE THAT I CITED THAT HAS ALL HE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS ACROSS CITY STATE. THE VARIANCE BETWEEN THE LOW END OF THE NUMBER OF HOURS IN THE HIGH END IS EXTREMELY HIGH I KNOW SOME STATES REQUIRE TWO THOUSAND HOURS AND THEN THERE'S OTHER STATES THAT. REQUIRE LESS THAN A THOUSAND SO THERE REALLY IS NOT I DON'T THINK STATES HAVE COME TO ANY KIND OF A CONSENSUS WHEN IT COMES TO. APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF ENTRY LEVEL REQUIREMENTS FOR THESE BEAUTY PROFESSIONS AND MATT DO YOU HAVE A VIEW OF AS WHY THAT IS SO WHAT WHAT WHY WHY ARE WE HAVING SUCH STRUGGLES THERE TO FIND UNIFORMITY. AND REASONABLE STANDARDS. SURE I THINK THAT ONE MAJOR FACTOR IS. THAT THE BEAUTY THE STATE BOARD AND THE THAT BEAUTY SCHOOLS HAVE AN INCENTIVE THAT TO KEEP THE HOURS HIGHER SO THE LONGER. YOU'RE IN SCHOOL THE MORE MONEY THAT THAT BEAUTY SCHOOL MAKE THEY HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO KEEP THE HOURS AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE. AND I THINK REGULATORS AND POLICY MAKERS ARE KIND OF. YOU KNOW COMING TO THEIR SENSES A DATING THING DO YOU KNOW DO WE REALLY NEED TO BE REQUIRING TWO THOUSAND HOURS OR BOARD THIS PROFESSION WHEN MAY BE YOU KNOW A MORE REASONABLE AND NOW WOULD BE TWELVE HUNDRED OR SOMETHING THAT SOMEWHERE MORE IN THE MIDDLE. BUT THE BEAUTY SCHOOLS THAT ARE YOU KNOW PROFITING OFF OF THESE APPLICANTS. HAVE INCENTIVE TO KEEP THE NUMBER AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE SO I THINK THAT'S A BIG REASON IS. THE BEAUTY SCHOOLS WANT. TO KEEP PEOPLE IN SCHOOL AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. AND ARE THERE ANY PLACES THAT YOU THINK WE SHOULD LOOK TO HAVE A MORE OBJECTIVE OBSERVATIONS ABOUT WHAT REALLY IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS THAT WE ALL WANT. I WOULD I WOULD JUST POINT YOU TO THE- THAT DATABASE OF REQUIREMENTS THAT I MENTIONED I THINK YOU KNOW IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF HOURS. THAT OTHER STATES HAVE DONE AND MAYBE. THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW THE RATIONALE FOR WHY WOULD YOU KNOW STAY ONLY OFF ONLY A REQUIRE THOUSAND AND MAYBE THINK ABOUT MOVING MORE TOWARDS THAT THAT LOW AND WE'VE WE'VE DEFINITELY SEEN. DATE. BAKER LEE AND THIS INDUSTRY OF THE BEAUTY PROFESSIONS. THE REGULATING MORE INSTEAD OF AT RAMPING UP THE REGULATION SO I DON'T I DON'T SEE ANY STATE ADDING ON MORE HOURS I ONLY SEE STATE REMOVING THE NUMBER OF HOURS THAT THEY REQUIRE SETTING NATIONALLY THERE'S IS KIND OF A TREND. TO KIND OF LOOSENED THE REQUIREMENTS A LITTLE BIT AND THIS THIS AREA. BUT YEAH I WOULD JUST I WOULD LOOK AT THAT THE DATABASE AND LOOK AT THE REQUIREMENTS ACROSS STATES AND PICK SOMETHING IN THE MIDDLE YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THE STATE WITH THE LOWEST REQUIREMENTS BUT- IF YOU'RE ON THE HIGHER AND- MAYBE THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW WHY ARE ALL THESE OTHER STATES. I REQUIRING SO MANY LAST. THING CALIFORNIA ONE MORE FOLLOW QUESTION FOR ME AND THEN OTHERS ON THE PANEL MAY HAVE OTHER QUESTIONS MATT. SO THE I HEAR WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT TRYING TO FIND THAT MIDDLE GROUND BUT MY CHALLENGE ON THE HOURS ISSUE. IS THAT IT ALL SEEMS VERY ARBITRARY I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON. THE MERITS THE SUBJECT MATTER THE COMPLEXITY THE HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS THAT WE THINK ARE REASONABLE. RATHER THAN THIS ARBITRARY NATURE OF OURS I MEAN I KNOW I TALK ABOUT IT A LOT THIS HEARING SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS SEEMS. TO ME TO BE EXCESSIVE WHEN IT TAKES. EIGHT HUNDRED PLUS HOURS TO BE A POLICE OFFICER AND YOU CAN LOOK AT IT. YOU KNOW YOU CAN EVEN LOOK AT LOOK YOU CAN LOOK AT IN RELATION TO OTHER. PRACTICES AND THEIR EDUCATION TRAINING BUT- AT THE END OF THE DAY. IT SHOULD JUST BE ABOUT AN ARBITRARY NUMBER IT REALLY SHOULD BE ABOUT WHAT ARE WHAT ARE THE OUTCOMES ARE TRYING TO SEE. WHAT ARE THE COMPETENCIES WE WANT THEM TO ACHIEVE. SO HEALTH AND SAFETY IS PROTECTED SO. I APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK ABOUT. ALSO IN THE MAIL. THERE'S A LOW THERE'S A HOT. HELP THERE ARE WHAT. IS THIS. I KNOW THE OUT OF. THAT WE THINK. ARE REASONABLE. AND THEN AND THEN TO GO FROM. BUT LET ME SEE I CHAIR LOW ANY FOR FATHER QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. NOT MISTER FALL FALL QUESTION BUT SIMILAR TO CHECK ON SOME OF THOSE COMMENTS OF SHARING OBSERVATIONS TO. WE LOOK AT THE BUREAU OF LABOR AND THE REPORTS THAT THE MEAN INCOME. OF FOR MANY THESE INDIVIDUALS IS THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND A COMMENSURATE WITH THAT TYPE OF TRAINING. AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING SO I THINK IT'S OUR OUR OBLIGATION TO TAKE A LOOK AT SEEING WHAT. BEARERS THEY MIGHT BE TO HELP THEM BE SUCCESSFUL SETTING THEM UP FOR SUCCESS. PARTICULAR. GIVEN THE COST OF LIVING ALSO. IN IN THE STATE. ABSOLUTELY I I'D BE HAPPY TO JOIN AND I. SINCERELY APOLOGIZE FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE AND I HOPE ITWAS STILL. BENEFICIAL FOR THE COMMITTEE IT WAS THANKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET ME UP BEFORE WE GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT I JUST WANNA GIVE LESLIE IN ADAM AN OPPORTUNITY TO BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO FOLLOW MATT AND OUR ORIGINAL SCHEDULE BUT I WANT TO SEE IT TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO REACT IN A THEIR CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAD WITH HAVE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO SAY AND- IN CLOSING ON THIS. MICROPHONE. DOES THE TWO THINGS THAT I WOULD POINT OUT THAT WHEN HE'S HOT TALKED ABOUT THE CONSISTENCY AND HEALTH CARE PART OF THE DIFFERENCE AND HEALTH CARE POPULATIONS IS THAT WHEN YOU GRADUATE FROM A PROGRAM WHETHER IT'S IN NURSING OR MEDICINE OR ANYTHING IT'S ALWAYS AN ACCREDITED PROGRAM AND THAT IS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE WITH BEEN CONSISTENT IN COSMETOLOGY IS THAT IS SO MANY PROGRAMS THAT DON'T FALL INTO THAT ACCREDITED STATURE SAYS A STATUTE SO WHEN YOU MIX THOSE TWO THINGS OF NON ACCREDITED SCHOOLS AN ACCREDITED. SCHOOLS IN THE FALL OFF THAT GRAPHIC THAT HE HAD. FIND OUT. WHAT TYPE OF EDUCATION GETTING BE MY ONE COMMENT. Q. ADAM ANYTHING YOU WANT TO SAY IN REGARD TO MATS TESTIMONY. MR SHAFER SAID A- A LOT OF STUFF THAT I AGREE WITH IN THAT WE AGREE WITH THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TARTED THIS PROJECT SO WE CAN IDENTIFY THE RISK CAN CHANGE A DIALOGUE. THAT IS OCCURRING BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THE DIALOGUE IS VERY KERN IS ABOUT HOURS. AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE ORIGINAL OUR REQUIREMENT IF EVER CAME UP THAT'S WHY. THIS TYPE OF DOCUMENT YOU KNOW WE'RE WORKING ON IDENTIFYING THE RISK. IS A GOOD FOUNDATIONAL POINT OF US. REESTABLISHING WHERE THOSE HOURS CAME OUT IN THE FIRST PLACE. HE ALSO RAISED THAT I MEAN FOR US WE'RE TRYING TO FIND OBJECTIVE INFORMATION SO WE MAKE GOOD CHOICES. AND HE HE RAISE THE QUESTION THAT THERE IS A SELF PROTECTION INTEREST IN DETERMINING THE EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS. THAT WAS PRETTY PRETTY POINTS AS AN EIGHT AND I'M NOT AGREEING OR DISAGREEING WITH IT EXCEPT THAT WHEN IT COMES TO OUR WORK HERE. TRYING TO ASSESS THIS AND CARP THE PATHWAY GOING FORWARD. WE WANT TO MAKE US MORE CHOICES AND WE WANT TO BRING IN EXPERTS AND THERE ARE FOLKS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THIS FIELD FOR A LONG TIME THAT ARE VERY SOME SMARTER THAN ME FOR SURE. AND CERTAINLY WHEN HE GETS INTO THE- THE AT THAT THE MEDIA OF THE EDUCATION PROGRAM YOU KNOW I WANT TO HEAR FROM SMARTER PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT REALLY IS REQUIRED AND WHY AND HAVE IT BE JUSTIFIED IN. BUT I WANT TO HAVE I WANT TO HAVE. THAT INFORMATION I CAN TRUST. AND THAT ISN'T BASED ON A SELF INTEREST. AND THAT'S PART OF OUR CHALLENGE GOING FORWARD I KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE MORE CONVERSATIONS WE CERTAINLY HAVE GREAT STAFF EXPERTISE HERE THAT WE CAN RELY UPON. SO WITH THAT I'M GONNA GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT LIST AND ANYONE ELSE HAS ANYTHING TO ADD OKAY WELL THANK YOU TO BOTH OF YOU. FOR TRAVELING HERE LESLIE BOSTIAN ADAM HIGGINBOTHAM THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR SHARING YOUR EXPERTISE WITH US VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. SO IF OUR FOLKS WHO WOULD LIKE TO SHARE THEIR VIEW AND OUR PUBLIC COMMENT PORTION WE HAVE A MICROPHONE. ON THE SIDE OF THE ROOM. THERE THAT FOLKS INCOME AND SHARE THEIR THOUGHTS. WE HAVE JUST A COUPLE MINUTES LEFT ANYBODY WANT TO PROVIDE ANY THOUGHTS IN OUR PUBLIC TESTIMONY SECTION. IF YOU CAN IDENTIFY YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD IF YOU WISH. GOOD AFTERNOON JUST AFTERNOON FRED JONES ON BEHALF OF THE PROFESSIONAL BEAUTY FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA. JUST A COUPLE OF POINTS. THERE SIX HUNDRED TWENTY ONE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS LICENSING BY THE STATE BOARD OF BARRING COSMETOLOGY IN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S OVER 2% OF EVERY ADULT IN CALIFORNIA. TWO OUT OF A HUNDRED. THROW A BOWLING BALL IN A ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE YOU'LL IT TO STE TWO PEOPLE LICENSE BY THIS BOARD. SO THE QUESTION OF BARRIERS TO ENTRY. I'M NOT SURE WHO'S BAKING THAT QUESTION BUT IT SEEMS TO ME IT'S A SOLUTION LOOKING FOR A PROBLEM. MISS RUSTY ACSI SERVED WITH ME IN A NUMBER OF INDUSTRY FOLKS ON A RECENT STATE BOARD CONVENE TASK FORCE ON THE SIXTEEN HUNDRED OUR PROGRAM. AND BY CONSENSUS WE AGREED THAT THE SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS OFFERED IN CALIFORNIA IS THE MIDDLE GROUND OF ALL FIFTY STATES WE WENT THROUGH ALL OF THE CURRICULUM AND DECIDED IT WAS APPROPRIATE. HOWEVER MY ASSOCIATION WANTS TO EMBRACE COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION. WE THINK WE SHOULD THE STATE SHOULD OFFER IT AS AN OPTION. DON'T THROW THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATHWATER OUR INDUSTRY HAS ALREADY HAD TO ABSORB A LOT OF MAJOR CHANGES RECENTLY. BUT MAYBE REQUIRE FOUR HUNDRED HOURS OF HEALTH AND SAFETY THEORETICAL INSTRUCTION AND THEN ALLOW SCHOOLS TO CERTIFY THE TECHNIQUE COMPETENCIES. SO THAT YOU BASS HAVE A BASE AMOUNT OF HOURS AND THEN A CERTIFICATION PROCESS I THINK THERE'S LOTS OF WAYS WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THAT. WE ALSO PROPOSE DRAMATICALLY INCREASING EXTERNSHIP RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE TO GET 60% OF THOSE SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS BEFORE YOU CAN QUALIFY TO WORK IN THE SALON AS AN EXTRA AS AN UNPAID EXTRA. WE WOULD LIKE TO REDUCE THOSE HOURS GET KIDS INTO SALON SOONER AND ALLOW THEM TO BE PAID. WERE ALLOWING THE PROCESS TO BE PAID AFTER ONLY RECEIVING THIRTY NINE HOURS OF INSTRUCTION. AND THEN THEY GO THROUGH A TWO YEAR PROCESS OF BEING EARNING WHILE THEY'RE LEARNING SO WE THINK EXTERNSHIP SHOULD BE DRAMATICALLY INCREASED. IN TERMS OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAMS I BELIEVE THERE'S ONLY SIX COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAMS TEACHING COSMETOLOGY IN THE ENTIRE STATE BUDGET TWELVE NOW OKAY SO THERE'S ONLY TWELVE AND PART OF THAT REASON IS COMMITTEE COLLEGES VALUE TO BUY TWO TRANSFERS THEY'RE LOOKING OUT FOR YOUR DEGREES AS A PRIORITY WE CERTAINLY WOULD. EMBRACE MORE COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAMS BEING OFFERED. BUT GOOD LUCK DEALING WITH EACH COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT THEIR THEIR OWN FIVE TIMES. RECIPROCITY MOST OF THE PRESENTATION AT THE END WAS ABOUT STATE COMPACTS IN TWO THOUSAND SIX WE SPONSORED A BILL WITH LIZ FIGUEROA SENATOR FIGUEROA TAX TO CREATE LICENSURE BY ENDORSEMENT SO IT'S A MOOTPOINT SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IF YOU WANT TO MOVE FROM NEW YORK TO CALIFORNIA THE SHOW THAT YOU'VE WORKED THREE OF THE LAST FIVE YEARS WITH A LICENSE IN NEW YORK YOU PAY A FIFTY DOLLAR APPLICATION FEE AND YOU GET A LICENSE TOMORROW. SO A LOT OF THAT PRESENTATION WAS FAIRLY IGNORANT OF WHAT CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED DO YOU REALIZE WE ACTUALLY HAVE BARBERING PROGRAMS HAPPENING IN OUR STATE PRISONS. AND THAT ANY CONVICT CAN APPEAL TO THE STATE BOARD IN ADVANCE OF THEIR EDUCATION TO FIND OUT WHETHER THEIR CRIMINAL OFFENSE WILL DISQUALIFY THEM FROM LICENSE. STARBOARD FREE DECADES HAS PUSHED THE ENVELOPE IN EMBRACING PEOPLE THAT HAVE CRIMINAL BACKGROUNDS. TO BE ABLE TO COME AND BE LICENSED IN OUR INDUSTRY. ASSEMBLYMEMBER LOW YOU MENTION THE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR A YEAR SALARY. I HATE TO ADMIT IT. WE HAVE A HUGE UNDER REPORTING PROBLEM IN OUR INDUSTRY IN ALL CASH BUSINESSES THAT'S TYPICAL IT'S VERY TYPICAL IN OUR INDUSTRY AND THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM WHEN YOU START GETTING INTO DEBT TO RATIO INCOME EARNING RATIOS. WE HAVE SUCH A HUGE PROBLEM OF UNDER REPORTING. THE IRS LABOR STATISTICS BOARD HAVE NO CLUE HOW MUCH WE ACTUALLY EARN I CAN SHOULD PROVIDE SOME INFORMATION THAT OUR STATE BOARD PRESIDENT HAS COMPILED FROM THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. IT'S OVERWHELMING WHAT A UNDER REPORTING PHENOMENON AND PROBLEMS THE HOUSE IN THIS INDUSTRY AND JUST ONE FINAL COMMENT TO CHAIRMAN GLAZER. AS AN ATTORNEY I CAN TELL YOU YOU CANNOT TAKE THE BAR EXAM UNLESS YOU'VE GONE TO A STATE ACCREDITED SCHOOL. FOUR YOU'VE WORKED UNDER A JUDGE FOR FOUR YEARS AND PAID QUARTERLY FEES TO THE STATE BOARD FOR FOUR YEARS. SO JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT ONE CLARIFICATION. GREAT THANK YOU MISTER JONES ANY UP OR ANYBODY ELSE WANT TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY. IF YOU LINE UP BEHIND THE MIKE SO I KNOW HOW MANY REMAIN THAT WOULD BE GOOD IF HE'S A LOT OUT OF TIME. THURSDAY AND DECIDE ON THE AISLE HIGH. GOOD YOUR NAME AND PLEASE AFTERNOON I'M MY NAME IS JAMIE SHOT BACK AND THE STAKEHOLDERS IN THE AUDIENCE KNOW ME WELL BECAUSE OVER THE LAST TWELVE YEARS I'VE ATTENDED MORE THAN FIFTY FIVE STATE BOARD MEETINGS AT MY OWN EXPENSE. I'M A LICENSE MEDICARE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO AND I OWN AN EMPLOYEE BASED NAIL SALON IN CARMEL CALIFORNIA. I DID EARN A FOUR YEAR DEGREE AND SHORTLY THERE AFTER ACTUALLY PAID MY WAY THROUGH GRADUATE SCHOOL DOING NAILS. TO EARN A PHD IN EDUCATION WITH AN EMPHASIS ON CURRICULUM AND INSTRUCTION AND LANGUAGE AND LITERACY SO I COULD SPEND HOURS TALKING ABOUT EDUCATION IN OUR INDUSTRY BUT I'D RATHER FOCUS ON A COUPLE OTHER THINGS INSTEAD. I TEACH MORE CLASSES AT MORE BEAUTY SHOWS THAN ANY OTHER DEAL PRO IN OUR INDUSTRY. AND I'M COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT I TEACH AT SHOWS IN THE STATES THAT HAVE THE LARGEST LICENSEE POPULATION SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT NEW YORK FLORIDA TEXAS ILLINOIS OHIO SO I INTERACT WITH THESE PEOPLE ON A REGULAR BASIS AND LESLIE INTERACTS IN A DIFFERENT WAY BECAUSE SHE'S TRAVELING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND DEALING DIRECTLY WITH THE LEGISLATORS. AND THE REGULATORS I'M DEALING WITH THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND I'M DEALING WITH THE LICENSEES IN THE SALON OWNERS ALL OVER. AND I WILL SAY THAT. NOTHING TO THIS POINT THAT ANY STATE. HAS LEGISLATIVE WORTH CONSIDERING LEGISLATING IS NEARLY AS IMPORTANT OR IMPACTFUL AS WHAT CALIFORNIA COULD AND SHOULD DO THAT IS THE LEVEL OF INFLUENCE AND POWER THAT YOU HAVE OVER THIS INDUSTRY. AND I JUST WANT TO ADD A FEW THINGS HERE BUT REFER TO MY NOTES AND I'M OLD DEL SECTOR CLASSES. BUT I WANT TO SAY. THAT SPEAKING FOR MYSELF BOTH PERSONALLY ND PROFESSIONALLY. I'D RATHER BE ALONE THAN IN BAD COMPANY. AND I THINK THIS IS A TIME WHERE WE DEFINITELY HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE OUR LEADERSHIP. AND WE HAVE THAT POWER TO DO THAT. AS A MANICURIST I KNOW A LOT OF THESE CONVERSATIONS COME BACK TO MALES. AND I AM READY AND PREPARED FOR THE SCRUTINY THAT I FEEL THAT WE DESERVE FROM THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE IF WE CANNOT. JUSTIFY HOW WE DO THINGS. AND WHY WE DO THE THINGS THAT WE DO. THEN WE SHOULD BE CHALLENGED. EVERYTHING THAT WE DO COULD DEFINITELY USE IMPROVEMENT BUT I WILL SAY TO THIS POINT THAT. CHRISTY UNDERWOOD AND HER STAFF HAVE WORKED DILIGENTLY OVER THE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE BOARD WHICH IS BEEN OVER TWELVE. TO MEET LEGISLATIVE MANDATES. OVER THE YEARS AND PERHAPS THE LEGISLATURE WAS AND ALWAYS ASKING FOR THE RIGHT THINGS. AND O HERE WE ARE. SO GOING FORWARD LET ME JUST POINT OUT THAT. WE CAN ATTACK THIS LOTS OF DIFFERENT ANGLES AS A CONSUMER WE TELL CONSUMERS. TO DO THEIR RESEARCH. BY LICENSURE THE BREEZE SYSTEM BUT WHAT'S THE POINT THE TECHNOLOGY WHEN ESTABLISHMENT OWNERS AND LICENSEES CAN MARKET THEMSELVES AND ADVERTISE WITH FAKE NAMES THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT YOU IS A LICENSEE ACTUALLY USE YOUR NAME AND YOUR ADVERTISEMENT SO I WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE WORTHWHILE TO REQUIRE US IS LICENSEES ESTABLISHMENT OWNERS TO ADVERTISE WITH OUR LICENSE NUMBERS SO THAT CONSUMERS CAN DO THEIR DUE DILIGENCE AND LOOK US UP AND MAKE SURE THAT WE DO HOLD. A VALID LICENSE FROM BORDER BARBERING COSMETOLOGY. WE NEED TO UPDATE OUR LICENSING CATEGORIES THIS GOES ALONG WITH THE COMP ASIAN ABOUT OUR REQUIREMENTS WE SHOULD HAVE A HERE ONLY LICENSE WE SHOULD HAVE LICENSES FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO WAX ONLY OR WHO WANT TO MAKE UP ONLY. SO THEY CAN GET INTO THE INDUSTRY FASTER THAT WILL REDUCE THE BARRIER TO ENTRY. AND THEN LASTLY AS WERE MENTIONED THAT. WE DO NOT HAVE A CLEARLY DEFINED SCOPE OF PRACTICE FOR ANYTHING THAT WE DO WHERE IS THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN. MEDICAL AND BEAUTY pPODIATRY. AND NAILS. WE DON'T HAVE IT THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE ALL THIS FUNNY STUFF HAPPENING WE HAVE PEOPLE DOING INGROWN TOENAIL WORK. WITH PEOPLE GETTING INFECTIONS I SERVE AS AN EXPERT WITNESS NOT ONLY FOR THE STATE BOARD BUT I ACTUALLY DO TAKE ON CASES THAT INVOLVE. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SUING. THEY'RE SUING THE ESTABLISHMENTS THEY'RE TRYING TO GET COMPENSATION. NOW ALL THESE THINGS RUN THROUGH THE STATE BOARD IN FACT MOST OF THE LAWYERS I TALKED TO HAVE NO INTEREST IN HAVING THEIR CLIENT REPORT THEIR INJURY THE STATE BOARD BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHERE THE MONEY IS MONEY IS IN THE INSURANCE COMPANY. SO FOR ALL THE INJURIES THAT WE FIND OUT ABOUT BECAUSE THEY ARE POSTED OR LESLIE'S COLLECTING THESE PHOTOGRAPHS. THIS IS THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. SO I WOULD ASK THAT. WE BE A PART OF THIS PROCESS AGAIN I WELCOME THE SCRUTINY. I WOULD WANT TO US TO BE ABLE TO JUSTIFY OUR EXISTENCE AND TO EARN YOUR TRUST AS LICENSEES THAT WE'RE HERE TO FOLLOW THE LAW. BUT WE ALSO ASK THAT YOU. REGULATORS JUDICIOUSLY SO THAT WERE ABLE TO COMPETE N A VERY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY SO THAT WE CAN DO OUR BEST. IT'S UP TO US TO ALSO PROTECT OUR CLIENTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY YES SIR NEXT UP. CENTER GLAZER AND SIMPLY MEN LOW AND COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME SPEAK MY NAME IS PETER WEST RECKON THE PROFESSOR. AT RIVERSIDE CITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. I GET SOMEONE TO TAKE THE FOR THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM TODAY. BUT I'VE BEEN ACTIVELY ENGAGED SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY AND THE- WITH ALL THE INDUSTRY IN TWENTY YEARS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR THE DUCATION OF BEEN DEPARTMENT CHAIR AND DIRECTOR OF COSMETOLOGY RIVERSIDE CITY COLLEGE NOW FOR THE PAST SIXTEEN YEARS I WAS ALSO PRESENT AT THE MEETING THAT MISTER JOHNSON SPEAKING OF OR THE CURRICULUM. COMMITTEE GOT TOGETHER AND LOOKED AT THE CURRICULUM NOT ONCE DID WE DISCUSS HOURS FOR OUR BENEFIT AS YOU KNOW IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR I GET PAID EITHER WAY DOESN'T MATTER TO ME. BUT WE LOOK AT THE CURRICULUM AND STILL LEARNING OUTCOMES WHAT OUR STUDENTS ARE GOING TO PERCEIVE WHAT THEY SHOULD LEARN AT THE END OF THE DAY. I HAVE TO KIND OF REMEMBER THAT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CURRICULUM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TEACHING STUDENTS A CHANGE IN BEHAVIOR WHICH CAUSES THE COGNITIVE DOMAIN. AS CYCLE MOTOR SKILLS SAID DOMAIN AND EFFECTIVE DOMAIN WHICH CAUSES A CHANGE OF BEHAVIOR NOT SIMPLY REMEMBERING FACTS BUT WE WANT THEM TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR SO THAT WHEN THEY GET EMPLOYED. THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE ON. WORKING IN RISK FREE AND INDUSTRY SO THEY DON'T HAVE THESE PROBLEMS LATER DOWN HE ROAD WAS SITE AND FIND IN ISSUES. SO THERE'S THE DESIRE THERE'S THE AND PUT THERE'S THE ASSIMILATION AND THE OTHER PART IS THE REPETITION THAT STUDENTS NEED TO DO. TO BECOME EFFECTIVE IN INDUSTRY. SO WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE HOURS SCOPE OR THE HOURS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ACTUALLY OUR PROGRAM IN OUR C. C. IS ACTUALLY. SIXTEEN HUNDRED FIFTY HOURS WE HAVE STUDENTS TO STICK AROUND FOR TWO THOUSAND HOURS. BECAUSE THEY WANT THAT SECURITY BEFORE THEY GET LICENSE. WE JUST HAD A REMEDIAL CLASS HAD FORTY STUDENTS ATTEND REMEDIAL NOT BECAUSE THEY NEEDED TO ARE REQUIRED TO BUT THEY WANT TO COME TO. THE COLLEGE AND GET FURTHER TREATMENT. FURTHER EDUCATION SO WE CALL REMEDIAL COURSE AND THE BIGGEST THING THAT I SEE IN THE REMEDIAL COURSES IS THAT. PEOPLE ARE COMING INTO THE INDUSTRY WITH NOT A CHANGE IN BEHAVIOR THEY COME WITH FACTS TO PASS THE TEST. AND COGNITIVE SKILLS SETS TO OUR CYCLE MORE SCHOOL SAYS TO PASS THE TEST AND THEN FROM THERE ON THE DON'T LEARN. WE NEED A CHANGE IN BEHAVIOR FOR THE STUDENTS AND THOSE ARE DETERMINED BY THE STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THE OUR STRUCTURE ONCE AGAIN WE GOVERNMENT IS THE COGNITIVE SKILL SET. THERE'S A PSYCH MOTOR TO MAIN SKILL SET. AND THEN THE REPETITION WHICH IS THE EFFECTIVE DOMAIN TO GIVE THE STUDENTS VALUE FOR WHAT THEY'RE DOING WE GRADUATE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED STUDENTS YEAR I THINK WE'RE DOING PRETTY GOOD AT OUR PUBLIC. COMMITTEE COLLEGE OF WHERE WE'RE AT AND RIVERSIDE. AND I NOT SURE I THROUGHOUT TWELVE BUT WE KEEP INCREASING. BARSTOW COMMITTEE COLLEGES OPEN UP THE COSMETOLOGY PROGRAM WE JUST OPEN UP IN AS STAKES PROGRAM. WHEN THE BIG BENEFITS THAT WE HAD THIS LAST. THREE YEARS AGO AND WE'RE ON OUR FOURTH YEAR FUNDING CYCLE NOW IS STRONG WORK FORCE. AMY GAVE US A LOT OF THAT DOLLARS AND STATE DOLLARS TO MATCH THAT SO I'M WITH YOU CENTER GLAZER WHO COMMITTEE COLLEGES DO NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB IT'S CLEAR TECH EDUCATION. AND WE COULD USE THE SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH JUST COMING TO THE END HERE YES MA'AM WELCOME TO SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS OF I SPOKE BRIEFLY LAST TIME MY NAME IS WENDY COCHRAN I'M A LICENSED ESTHETICIAN I'M THE FOUNDER OF CALIFORNIA. ASCETIC LIFE A STATIC ALLIANCE AND WE ARE REGISTERED WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS A TRADE AGENCY AND FOR EDUCATION. I REPRESENT OVER FIVE THOUSAND LICENSED ESTHETICIANS IN MY GROUPS AND CONTINUING EDUCATION IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR US I BELIEVE THAT WHEN WE ARE DISCUSSING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE VALUE OF THE PRIVATIZED SCHOOLS VERSUS THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. THE PUBLIC SCHOOL EDUCATION THAT THEY ARE RECEIVING IS. MORE ON TARGET WITH STAYING WITHIN SCOPE OF PRACTICE THEY TEND TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE RELIABLE WITH STAYING IN SCOPE FOR NOT VENTURING OUT INTO THE THINGS THAT THE PRIVATE MANUFACTURERS ARE BRINGING TO THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS THAT ARE COMING IN ON REGULATED SO PROCESSES LIKE MICRO BLADING WHICH ARE NOT PART OF OUR SCOPE OF PRACTICE IN CALIFORNIA ARE BEING BROUGHT INTO THE PRIVATIZED SCHOOLS ALL THE TIME. SO THOSE STUDENTS ARE LEARNING THESE PROCESSES THAT ARE WAY OUT OF SCOPE OF PRACTICE IN THESE PRIVATE SCHOOLS WITH WITH NO NO I HAVE REPERCUSSIONS SO THEY GO OUT INTO THE INDUSTRY ON THEIR OWN USUALLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE AN EMPLOYMENT SITUATION TO GO TO THEY JUST OPEN UP SHOP START A BUSINESS LICENSE AND THEY'RE ON THEIR OWN. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PEOPLE THAT ARE THEY'RE NOT REALLY BEING SUPERVISED VERY HONESTLY THEY ARE COMING OUT AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO WORK IN AN ACTUAL SALON ENVIRONMENT AS AN EMPLOYEE. THEY'RE ALL FREELANCERS DOING THEIR OWN THING. SO THESE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE EVERYONE TO CONSIDER WHEN YOU'RE MAKING YOUR DECISIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE WISH TO TESTIFY. SO YOU'RE GONNA BE ENTERTAINED FOR TWENTY MORE SECONDS THIS REAL QUICK BECAUSE ROCK THANK YOU. I DID THE BASIC MATH HERE FOR THE OREGON STACKABLE LICENSING. AND THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES THE COSMETOLOGY AESTHETICS AND NAILS AND IF YOU ADD THOSE TOGETHER THAT'S NINETEEN HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN HOURS. AND CUT IT EVERY OTHER STATES ABOUT THE SAME WAY. AND WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE A COSMETOLOGY LICENSING ONLY THAT CARRIES ALL THOSE. CATEGORIES WITH SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS SO IT IS A STREAMLINED. LICENSING TO PROVIDE ALL THOSE THOSE. DISCIPLINES AND ALSO REMEMBER THAT WE OF APPROVED ELEVEN HUNDRED OUR HAIR STYLING LICENSE TO WE'D LIKE TO SEE THEM VERY GOOD ALL RIGHT WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR A CLOSING COMMENT SOMEONE INVITE DATE COULD. MY CO CHAIR LOW TO A SHARE HIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR AGAIN WANT TO THANK ALL OF THOSE WHO HAVE COME OUT TODAY TO PROVIDE. OTHER INPUT CERTAINLY THERE ARE NUMBER OF ISSUE SAID TO BE ADDRESSED BY THINK THIS HELPS. I PROVIDED SOME DIRECTION ON THE OUTSTANDING ISSUES IN COMPARISON TO THE OTHER STATES. CERTAINLY I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO JUST STATE THAT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA GIVEN OUR CAPACITY THAT WE DO LIKE TO. SET THE STANDARDS IN THE LEAD WITH RESPECT TO THE NATION JUST GIVEN THE SCOPE AND THE TYPE OF. DEMOGRAPHICS AND ECONOMIC ENGINE THAT WE ARE AS A STATE. I ALSO WANT TO JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT I KNOW THAT THERE. COULD BE SME ADDITIONAL CONVERSATION WITHOUT OF THE BOARD OF CURRENTLY AS I UNDERSTAND IT WE ONLY  CURRENTLY HAVE FIVE OF THE NINE. BOARD MEMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN FILLED SO THEY'RE CURRENTLY A NUMBER OF VACANCIES WITH RESPECT TO THE BOARD SO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS. THAT TYPE OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE THAT CAN BE APPLICABLE AND SO WE NEED TO ASK THAT QUESTION AS TO WHY THEY WERE. ON THOSE OUTSTANDING VACANCIES A SIMILARLY WILL MENTION AND MIGHT BE A BROKEN RECORD AS WE CONTINUE ONE OF THESE ON PUBLIC HEARINGS BUT I DO THINK THAT THAT JUST GIVEN THE DEMOGRAPHICS AS WELL. OF THAT OF THE LICENSE POPULATION OF THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES SHOULD BE REFLECTED. AND HAVE THAT INPUT AS WELL SO NO THAT WILL ELICIT THAT ENGAGEMENT. AND THEN. FINALLY MAY ALSO JUST MENTION THAT I KNOW THAT AS A POINT OF. INFORMATION THAT THIS THE SECOND INFORMATIONAL HEARING UP FOR THIS. BOARD AND I KNOW THAT WE WILL BE EXPLORING AN ADDITIONAL ADD ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONAL HEARING. BEFORE THE LEGISLATIVE SESSION AND THEN RE CONVENES IN ADDITION TO THE VARIOUS POLICY INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS THAT WE WILL HAVE BOTH IN TE ASSEMBLY AND IN THE SENATE. AS WELL AS THE APPROPRIATIONS IN THE FISCAL COMPONENTS SO FOR REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD NOT BE THE BORDER OR DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS THE CONVERSATION WITH RESPECT TO THE MINISTRATIONS HAVING RESERVATION ON POLICY CHANGES WITHOUT FRAUD STAKEHOLDER INPUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR THIS PROSTATE COLDER INPUT AND SO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THE SERBS SUBSTANTIVE POLICY. CHANGES SHOULD BE MADE IN THESE SUNSET BILLS OR IF THIS IS APPROPRIATE VEHICLE AGAIN THERE ARE THREE IN BUT THREE INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS IN ADDITION TO THE POLICY HERE IS THAT WE HAVE SO AS TO REFLECTED HERE WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE POLICY CONVERSATIONS AND FRAUD INFORMATIONAL INPUT SO AGAIN OF THE OF THE CONVERSATION WITH ADMINISTRATION SHOULD BE SUCH THAT WE WILL CONTINUE. TO ELICIT AS MUCH BROAD STAKEHOLDER INPUT AS POSSIBLE SO AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH A CHAIR AND TO THE STAFF WE'VE ALSO ENGAGED IN A CONVERSATION THANK YOU TEACHER LOW AND THANK YOU TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF YOUR LEADERSHIP. ON THIS IN MANY AREAS IN OUR LICENSING WORLD CERTAINLY THANK YOU TO OUR TO OUR STAFF HERE IN THE SENATE. TO THOSE WHO HAVE COME TO TESTIFY TODAY THANK YOU AND MEMBERS THE. WHO HAVE SPECIAL EXPERTISE WHICH I APPRECIATE. FOR SURE IN THEIR THOUGHTS THANK YOU AS WELL. AND I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTIONS THAT HAVE COME EVEN TODAY FROM THE PUBLIC TESTIMONY. THAT'S THE IMPORTANT PART OF THE WORK THAT WE DO IS THAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN YOUR IDEAS. WE WANT TO DO THINGS BETTER THAT'S THE WHOLE GOAL HERE IS THAT WE WANT TO BE SMARTER. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE PUBLIC. IS PROTECTED. AND SO I APPRECIATE IN PARTICULAR THE IDEAS THAT YOU HAVE COME OUT TODAY. ABOUT HOW WE MIGHT EXAMINE THE AT THE THESE THESE ISSUES AS WE GO FORWARD. ABOUT WITH CONSTRUCTIVE IDEAS AND WHAT WE WANT TO AVOID AND I. I I'M SURE THAT MY AYE COCHAIR FEELS THE SAME. IS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO. MAKE LAST MINUTE CHANGES IN THE SUMMER. TO THESE PROGRAMS WE WANT TO HAVE THESE IDEAS WE PRIDE OUT AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE. SO TO HAVE CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT MEANS THE TO GET IN THE GAME AND TO COME UP WITH YOUR THOUGHTS AND IDEAS AND THAT CERTAINLY APPLIES. TO FOLKS THAT HAVE COME TODAY AND IT CERTAINLY APPLIES TO THE ADMINISTRATION. I WANTED TO MENTIONED INCLUDING INCLUSION THAT. WE ARE GOING TO BE MEETING IN THE COMING MONTHS TO LEARN ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE OF STUDENTS. WHO ATTENDED BOARD APPROVED. SCHOOL EXPERIENCES WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE PERSPECTIVE ABOARD LICENSEES AS WE HAVE HEARD. AND WE WANT TO TALK TO A- WE WANNA LOOK AT THE REALITIES OF CONSUMERS WHO ARE SEEKING OUT AND RECEIVING BEAUTIFICATION SERVICES. THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND HOW THAT'S WORKING. LICENSE AND ON LICENSE AND WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING ABOUT IT. AND SO WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN MY COACH HERE.
