HIGHWAY COUNT TO THE GENERAL

00:06:50.042 --> 00:06:52.912
FUND THE BOTTOM LINE FOR ME IS

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:54.847
THIS THIS GOES AGAINST A

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:56.916
PROMISE A PROMISE THAT THE

00:06:56.983 --> 00:06:57.950
STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE

00:06:58.017 --> 00:06:59.619
LEGISLATURE AND IN THE THEN

00:06:59.685 --> 00:07:02.288
GOVERNOR- IT MADE IN PROP SIXTY

00:07:02.355 --> 00:07:05.558
NINE. THAT REGARDLESS OF THE

00:07:05.625 --> 00:07:07.460
SOURCE WHETHER IT'S DIRECT FROM

00:07:07.527 --> 00:07:08.961
THE GAS TAX THEIR INTERESTS

00:07:09.028 --> 00:07:11.030
ITSELF THAT IS FROM THE GAS TAX

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:12.932

I THINK THIS IS A BROKEN

00:07:16.035 --> 00:07:17.970
PROMISE A BROKEN PROMISE IF

00:07:18.037 --> 00:07:19.906
THIS LEGISLATURE AND THE

00:07:19.972 --> 00:07:21.841

ABLE TO- THAT DO THEIR WORK-

00:22:51.837 --> 00:22:53.572

YES- CSU CHICO CONDUCTED A

00:23:23.869 --> 00:23:26.071
STUDY ON- AGRICULTURAL

ARE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND- THE

00:23:34.312 --> 00:23:35.514
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TESTING

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.115
THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING SO FAR WE

00:23:37.182 --> 00:23:39.284
HAD UP UNTIL TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:23:39.351 --> 00:23:41.052
FOR MOBILE- WHICH FOCUSED ON

00:23:41.119 --> 00:23:43.421
URBAN RURAL AND TRIBAL BUT NOT

00:23:43.488 --> 00:23:45.323
SPECIFICALLY AGRICULTURAL LANDS

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:46.725
SO THAT STUDY WAS LOOKING

00:23:46.792 --> 00:23:48.193
SPECIFICALLY AGRICULTURAL

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.629
LANDS. I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

00:23:50.695 --> 00:23:53.298
GAP MAY BE IN ORDER TO

00:23:53.365 --> 00:23:56.535
INTRODUCE PRECISION AGRICULTURE.

00:23:56.601 --> 00:23:57.135
AND SO WHAT WITH THIS PROPOSAL

00:23:57.202 --> 00:23:59.805
BE. SO THIS PROPOSAL IS TO

00:23:59.871 --> 00:24:01.139
REINSTITUTE OUR STATEWIDE

00:24:01.206 --> 00:24:03.008
TESTING AND THE REASON WE'RE

00:24:03.074 --> 00:24:04.810
PROPOSING TO DO TESTING

00:24:04.876 --> 00:24:06.578
MULTIPLE TIMES A YEAR IS THAT

00:24:06.645 --> 00:24:07.946
TECHNOLOGY IS CONSTANTLY

00:24:08.013 --> 00:24:10.715
EVOLVING AS ARE THE HANDSETS SO

00:24:10.782 --> 00:24:12.284
EACH TIME A NEW HANDSET COMES

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:13.218
OUT EACH TIME THE TECHNOLOGIES

00:24:13.285 --> 00:24:15.353
UPDATED. WE HAVE TO RETEST

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:16.788
UNDERSTAND HOW COVERAGE HAS

00:24:16.855 --> 00:24:18.290
CHANGED HOW MOBILE PERFORMANCE

00:24:18.356 --> 00:24:20.959
HAS CHANGED WHAT YOU CAN DO-

00:24:21.026 --> 00:24:24.095
ZOOM CALLS AT HOME FOR SCHOOL-

00:24:24.162 --> 00:24:26.031
WHETHER AGRICULTURAL LANDS ARE

00:24:26.097 --> 00:24:27.265
COVERED FOR PRECISION

00:24:27.332 --> 00:24:29.134
AGRICULTURE AND MOST

00:24:29.201 --> 00:24:31.136
IMPORTANTLY FOR PUBLIC SAFETY

00:24:31.203 --> 00:24:33.038
SO THAT WE UNDERSTAND FIRST A

00:24:33.104 --> 00:24:34.472
BASELINE OF WHAT THE COVERAGES

00:24:34.539 --> 00:24:36.308
BEFORE THERE'S ANY DISASTER.

00:24:36.374 --> 00:24:37.209
AND THEN WHEN THERE IS A

00:24:37.275 --> 00:24:42.414
DISASTER WHAT THE- URGENCY-

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.850
BASICALLY COVERAGE- SYSTEMS

00:24:44.916 --> 00:24:46.918

PROVIDE THAT EXTRA COVERAGE

00:24:48.053 --> 00:24:49.821
WHEN CELL SITES GO DOWN I

00:24:49.888 --> 00:24:50.622
UNDERSTAND THAT PERFORMANCE

00:24:50.689 --> 00:24:53.592
LET'S FINALLY. AT THE END WHEN-

00:24:53.658 --> 00:24:55.026
THERE'S RESTORATION BEING PUT

00:24:55.093 --> 00:24:56.461
IN PLACE BASED ON THE CELL

00:24:56.528 --> 00:24:57.429
SITES ARE BEING BROUGHT BACK UP

00:24:57.495 --> 00:25:02.100

UNSERVED COMMUNITIES- BUT

00:27:52.871 --> 00:27:53.738
SOMEHOW THERE NEEDS TO BE. A

00:27:53.805 --> 00:27:55.040
ONE AGENCY THAT THAT SAYS OKAY

00:27:55.106 --> 00:27:56.107

00:36:09.901 --> 00:36:12.303
ONES THAT ARE LOANS AND POINT

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:14.205
TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A

00:36:14.272 --> 00:36:16.007
FUTURE GENERAL FUND OBLIGATIONS

00:36:16.073 --> 00:36:19.610
THAT'S CREATED BY THAT TO REPAY

00:36:19.677 --> 00:36:23.214
THOSE. FUTURE THE- MAY REVISION

00:36:23.281 --> 00:36:24.415
ALSO INCLUDES A NUMBER OF

00:36:24.482 --> 00:36:26.150
GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION SO

00:36:26.217 --> 00:36:29.086
WELL MOST OF THE FOCUS IS ON.

00:36:29.153 --> 00:36:32.023
REDUCING COSTS- TRANSFERRING

00:36:32.089 --> 00:36:34.392
FUNDING IN ORDER TO. MAXIMIZE

00:36:34.458 --> 00:36:35.593
THE BENEFIT TO THE GENERAL FUND

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:36.360
GIVEN THE GENERAL CONDITION

00:36:36.427 --> 00:36:37.395
THERE ARE A FEW PLACES WHERE

00:36:37.461 --> 00:36:39.230
THAT THERE WHERE THERE ARE

00:36:39.297 --> 00:36:40.565
CHANNELS AND AUGMENTATION.

00:36:40.631 --> 00:36:41.666
AGAIN A COUPLE OF THESE ARE ON

00:36:41.732 --> 00:36:43.935
YOUR AGENDA TODAY BUT I JUST

00:36:44.001 --> 00:36:44.902
HIGHLIGHT THE FIRST TWO IN

00:36:44.969 --> 00:36:46.203
PARTICULAR UNDER PARKS AND

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:48.372
CDFA. THIS IS FUNNY THAT WE

00:36:48.439 --> 00:36:50.942
VIEW IS GENERALLY NECESSARY IS

00:36:51.008 --> 00:36:52.944
TO BACK FILL FOR THE STATE

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:55.580
AFFILIATED FAIRS AS WELL STATE

00:36:55.646 --> 00:36:58.316
PARKS TOO THEY CAN- OPERATE

00:36:58.382 --> 00:37:00.885
CONTINUE TO OPERATE. OR PAY FOR

00:37:00.952 --> 00:37:02.820
UNNECESSARY COSTS. EVEN THOUGH

00:37:02.887 --> 00:37:04.021
THEY HAVE A REDUCTION IN

00:37:04.088 --> 00:37:06.190
REVENUES FROM THEIR SHIPPING

00:37:06.257 --> 00:37:08.359
FEES OR FROM OTHER BANDS SO

00:37:08.426 --> 00:37:09.694
THESE ARE A NECESSARY COST

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:10.995
DRIVEN REALLY BY B. COVE IN

00:37:11.062 --> 00:37:14.599
NINETEEN. CRISIS AND PEOPLE

00:37:14.665 --> 00:37:15.333
STAYING AT HOME. IN ADDITION

00:37:15.399 --> 00:37:17.501
YOU CAN SEE A FEW OTHER-

00:37:17.568 --> 00:37:18.636
GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION

00:37:18.703 --> 00:37:20.504
PROPOSE IN THE MAY REVISION.

00:37:20.571 --> 00:37:22.440
IT'S NOT VERY MANY BUT- THERE

00:37:22.506 --> 00:37:24.675
ARE A FEW NOTABLE ONES THAT ARE

00:37:24.742 --> 00:37:26.944
ON THE AGENDA TODAY. A COUPLE

00:37:27.011 --> 00:37:30.081
OF HIGH LEVEL- COMMENTS ABOUT

00:37:30.147 --> 00:37:32.049
THE GENERAL FUND BUDGET AND

00:37:32.116 --> 00:37:34.318
OVERALL ARCHITECTURE. IN

00:37:34.385 --> 00:37:35.219
GENERAL I FIND THAT THE

00:37:35.286 --> 00:37:36.554
PROPOSALS INCLUDING THE

00:37:36.621 --> 00:37:37.521
EXPENDITURE REDUCTIONS ARE

00:37:37.588 --> 00:37:39.457
REASONABLE IN LIGHT OF THE

00:37:39.523 --> 00:37:41.926
GENERAL FUND CONDITION THAT'S-

00:37:41.993 --> 00:37:44.595
THAT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED BUT IT

00:37:44.662 --> 00:37:46.263
IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT MANY

00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:48.165
OF THE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS ARE

00:37:48.232 --> 00:37:49.867
ONE TIME IN NATURE OF THE LOANS

00:37:49.934 --> 00:37:51.836
TRANSFERRED AND ALSO THE SHIPS.

00:37:51.902 --> 00:37:53.237
THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER WHERE

00:37:53.304 --> 00:37:54.538
SPECIAL FUNDS ARE BEING USED TO

00:37:54.605 --> 00:37:56.107
BACKFILL GENERAL FUND

00:37:56.173 --> 00:37:58.275
REDUCTIONS. WINDOWS ARE JUST

00:37:58.342 --> 00:38:01.612
ONE TIME AND WE DO PROJECT A

00:38:01.679 --> 00:38:03.681
MULTI YEAR BUDGET PROBLEM. BUT

00:38:03.748 --> 00:38:05.549
WITH RESPECT TO THE LAST TWO

00:38:05.616 --> 00:38:07.985
COMMENTS HERE JUST- THE ARE

00:38:08.052 --> 00:38:09.120
REALLY IN SOME WAYS THE SIDES

00:38:09.186 --> 00:38:12.023
OF THE SAME COIN- BROADLY WHAT

00:38:12.089 --> 00:38:12.790
ARE YOU LOOKING AT IT WHETHER

00:38:12.857 --> 00:38:14.091
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE- CUTS

00:38:14.158 --> 00:38:15.826
IMPROVE- PROPOSED IN THE MAY

00:38:15.893 --> 00:38:18.596
REVISION FOR THE AUGMENTATIONS-

00:38:18.663 --> 00:38:21.065
THESE. ULTIMATELY ARE ONES THAT

00:38:21.132 --> 00:38:22.266
REFLECT THE GOVERNOR'S

00:38:22.333 --> 00:38:23.534
PRIORITIES AND SO WE'D

00:38:23.601 --> 00:38:24.535
RECOMMEND THAT AS YOU LOOK AT

00:38:24.602 --> 00:38:26.203
EACH OF THESE. THAT YOU

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:28.305
CONSIDER THEM- WHETHER THEY ARE

00:38:28.372 --> 00:38:29.507
CONSISTENT WITH YOUR GENERAL

00:38:29.573 --> 00:38:31.075
FUND PRIORITY AND NOT JUST

00:38:31.142 --> 00:38:32.677
WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF RESOURCES

00:38:32.743 --> 00:38:34.111
AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.

00:38:34.178 --> 00:38:35.746
BUT IN IN THE CONTEXT OF THE

00:38:35.813 --> 00:38:38.249
BROADER STATEWIDE BUDGET WHERE

00:38:38.315 --> 00:38:40.117
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF- CHANNEL

00:38:40.184 --> 00:38:42.119
FIND PRODUCTIONS THAT HAVE TO

00:38:42.186 --> 00:38:44.822
BE. IMPLEMENTED IN ORDER TO

00:38:44.889 --> 00:38:48.025
HAVE A BALANCED BUDGET. BY JUNE

00:38:48.092 --> 00:38:51.262
FIFTEENTH. IT'S ALSO WORTH

00:38:51.328 --> 00:38:52.830
MENTIONING THERE ARE A FEW

00:38:52.897 --> 00:38:54.298
SIGNIFICANT SPECIAL AND BOND

00:38:54.365 --> 00:38:56.133
FUND RELATED PROPOSALS AND THEN

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.569
A REVISION AS YOU KNOW A

00:38:58.636 --> 00:38:59.704
SPECIAL FUNDS AND BONDS AND

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:00.738
ACTUALLY MAKE A VERY LARGE

00:39:00.805 --> 00:39:03.207
PERCENTAGE OF OVERALL SPENDING

00:39:03.274 --> 00:39:04.542
IN THE RESOURCES ENVIRONMENTAL

00:39:04.608 --> 00:39:06.444
PROTECTION PROGRAMS SUCH A

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:07.812
HIGHLY VERY QUICKLY JUST A FEW

00:39:07.878 --> 00:39:09.680
OF THOSE YOU KNOW MOST OF THE

00:39:09.747 --> 00:39:11.415
DISCUSSION OF LATE IS FOCUSED

00:39:11.482 --> 00:39:13.617
ON THE- CHANNELS ON THERE ARE

00:39:13.684 --> 00:39:15.319
SOME IMPORTANT PROPOSALS HERE

00:39:15.386 --> 00:39:16.887
THE FIRST IS CAP AND TRADE

00:39:16.954 --> 00:39:18.522
EXPENDITURE PLAN IT'S IMPORTANT

00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:19.690
TO NOTE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

00:39:19.757 --> 00:39:21.625
BUDGET CONTINUES TO PROPOSE THE

00:39:21.692 --> 00:39:23.194
SAME SPENDING PLAN AS IN

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:25.229
JANUARY INCLUDING A NINE

00:39:25.296 --> 00:39:25.763
HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:27.531
DOLLAR DISCRETIONARY. SPENDING

00:39:27.598 --> 00:39:29.433
PLAN IMPORTANTLY THAN A

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.635
REVISION DOES HAVE MODIFIED

00:39:31.702 --> 00:39:32.770
BUDGET LANGUAGE THAT

00:39:32.837 --> 00:39:34.071
PRIORITIZES THE REVENUES

00:39:34.138 --> 00:39:36.640
TOWARDS CERTAIN PROGRAMS. AND

00:39:36.707 --> 00:39:38.142
IN OUR VIEW THIS IS HAVING SOME

00:39:38.209 --> 00:39:39.910
SORT OF PRIORITIZATION IS

00:39:39.977 --> 00:39:41.112
REALLY CRITICAL THERE'S A LOT

00:39:41.178 --> 00:39:43.447
OF UNCERTAINTY GIVEN REDUCED

00:39:43.514 --> 00:39:44.715
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY REDUCE

00:39:44.782 --> 00:39:46.383
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. THERE

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:48.219
IS A SIGNIFICANT POSSIBILITY

00:39:48.285 --> 00:39:50.721
THAT REVENUES WILL BE LOWER. IN

00:39:50.788 --> 00:39:51.255
THE BUDGET YEAR THAN HAD

00:39:51.322 --> 00:39:53.591
PREVIOUSLY BEEN. ASSUMED SO

00:39:53.657 --> 00:39:54.925
ESTABLISHING SOME SOME SORT OF

00:39:54.992 --> 00:39:56.894
MECHANISM TO PRIORITIZE

00:39:56.961 --> 00:39:58.796
REVENUES FOR CERTAIN PROGRAMS

00:39:58.863 --> 00:40:01.065
IS VERY REASONABLE. WE SIMPLY

00:40:01.132 --> 00:40:02.133
POINT OUT THERE ARE DIFFERENT

00:40:02.199 --> 00:40:02.867
WAYS THAT YOU COULD STRUCTURE

00:40:02.933 --> 00:40:04.802
THIS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

00:40:04.869 --> 00:40:07.705
ESSENTIALLY HAVE. TWO TIERS THE

00:40:07.772 --> 00:40:08.873
FIRST SET OF PROGRAMS THAT

00:40:08.939 --> 00:40:10.608
WOULD RECEIVE FUNDING. AS

00:40:10.674 --> 00:40:12.042
REVENUE COMES IN AND ONCE THOSE

00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:13.778
ARE FULLY FUNDED BEEN THE

00:40:13.844 --> 00:40:15.312
REMAINING PROGRAMS COULD START

00:40:15.379 --> 00:40:16.547
RECEIVING FUN YOU COULD HAVE

00:40:16.614 --> 00:40:17.481
MORE CARE YOU COULD STRUCTURE

00:40:17.548 --> 00:40:18.616
IT DIFFERENT WAYS. AND OF

00:40:18.682 --> 00:40:20.551
COURSE MOST IMPORTANTLY THE

00:40:20.618 --> 00:40:21.652
FINAL SPENDING PLAN SHOULD

00:40:21.719 --> 00:40:25.422
REFLECT THE PROGRAM THAT YOU

00:40:25.489 --> 00:40:25.990
THINK ARE MOST IMPORTANT. I

00:40:26.056 --> 00:40:26.724
WORTH NOTING THE MAYOR

00:40:26.791 --> 00:40:28.793
WITHDRAWS TWO MAJOR CLIMATE

00:40:28.859 --> 00:40:30.895
PROPOSALS FROM JANUARY OF FOUR

00:40:30.961 --> 00:40:32.129
POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR

00:40:32.196 --> 00:40:35.099
CLIMBED UP ON. AND ALSO TWO

00:40:35.166 --> 00:40:36.200
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS

00:40:36.267 --> 00:40:38.002
FOR NEWLY ESTABLISHED CLIMATE

00:40:38.068 --> 00:40:42.540
CATALYSTS LINED. AND TWO OTHER

00:40:42.606 --> 00:40:44.408
QUICK NOTES- THE MAY REVISION

00:40:44.475 --> 00:40:46.177
AND STILL CONTINUES WHAT IS A

00:40:46.243 --> 00:40:47.711
VERY SIGNIFICANT POLICY

00:40:47.778 --> 00:40:50.381
PROPOSAL THAT WOULD RELATE TO

00:40:50.447 --> 00:40:52.116
THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC

00:40:52.183 --> 00:40:54.151
SUBSTANCES CONTROL. THIS IS TO

00:40:54.218 --> 00:40:55.753
CREATE A NEW OVERSIGHT BOARD

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:57.021
THAT WOULD- IN ADDITION TO

00:40:57.087 --> 00:40:58.422
DOING OVERSIGHT WITNESSED WHICH

00:40:58.489 --> 00:41:00.524
SET FEES IN THE FUTURE AND ALSO

00:41:00.591 --> 00:41:01.926
TRAILER THE LANGUAGE THAT WOULD

00:41:01.992 --> 00:41:03.327
ESTABLISH A NEW FEE STRUCTURE

00:41:03.394 --> 00:41:05.329
FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO ADDRESS

00:41:05.396 --> 00:41:07.064
ONGOING STRUCTURAL DEFICIT AND

00:41:07.131 --> 00:41:08.432
THEN NOTABLY THERE'S ALSO

00:41:08.499 --> 00:41:09.600
INCREASE SPENDING IN THE MAY

00:41:09.667 --> 00:41:11.368
REVISION. FROM BOND FUND

00:41:11.435 --> 00:41:13.404
PRICKLY PROPOSITION SIXTY THREE

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:15.105
APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE.

00:41:15.172 --> 00:41:18.576
TWO YEARS AGO- THIS IS

00:41:18.642 --> 00:41:19.109
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT HELPS

00:41:19.176 --> 00:41:21.545
EXPLAIN AND- WHY EVEN THOUGH

00:41:21.612 --> 00:41:22.947
YOU SEE ALL THOSE GENERAL FUND

00:41:23.013 --> 00:41:25.983
REDUCTIONS. IN THE BUDGET- THIS

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:27.351
INCREASE IN MONTANA IS THAT ONE

00:41:27.418 --> 00:41:28.686
OF THE MAJOR REASONS THAT

00:41:28.752 --> 00:41:30.387
OVERALL SPENDING APPEARS TO BE

00:41:30.454 --> 00:41:34.758
FLAT. SO WITH THAT- I AM HAPPY

00:41:34.825 --> 00:41:36.560
TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS OF COURSE

00:41:36.627 --> 00:41:37.328

CAN SEE FROM THE AGENDA HAVE

00:42:24.375 --> 00:42:27.244
BEEN- BUT PUSHED OUT SO WE CAN

00:42:27.311 --> 00:42:29.179
HAVE A DISCUSSION ON THIS I

00:42:29.246 --> 00:42:30.714
KNOW ONE OF THE CRITERIA THAT

00:42:30.781 --> 00:42:32.483
THIS SUBCOMMITTEE HAS USES.

00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:33.984
REDUCTION IN GREENHOUSE GAS

00:42:34.051 --> 00:42:35.786
EMISSIONS THERE ARE OTHER VERY

00:42:35.853 --> 00:42:37.821
VALUABLE PUBLIC POLICY PROGRAMS

00:42:37.888 --> 00:42:41.191
THAT WE HAVE- THE FINANCE

00:42:41.258 --> 00:42:42.626
DEPARTMENT AND THE GOVERNOR'S

00:42:42.693 --> 00:42:44.695
BUDGET PUTS OUT A PROPOSAL WE

00:42:44.762 --> 00:42:48.032
HAVE. WORK THAT WE DO HERE

00:42:48.098 --> 00:42:50.701
DETERMINING WHICH- PROGRAMS

00:42:50.768 --> 00:42:51.835
GIVE US THE BIGGEST BANG FOR

00:42:51.902 --> 00:42:52.937
THE BUCK BECAUSE WE STILL DO

00:42:53.003 --> 00:42:54.605
HAVE A CLIMATE CRISIS AND IT'S

00:42:54.672 --> 00:42:56.307
IMPORTANT THAT WE USE WHATEVER

00:42:56.373 --> 00:43:01.145

EXTENDING. THE FIRE. ENGINE

00:54:28.632 --> 00:54:31.167
AVAILABILITY. RIGHT IN THE BACK

00:54:31.234 --> 00:54:32.469
INTO THE FIRE SEASON IS ONE OF

00:54:32.535 --> 00:54:34.971
THE MAIN FOCUS IS THIS PROPOSAL

00:54:35.038 --> 00:54:35.572
IS TO BE ABLE TO REMOVE THAT

00:54:35.639 --> 00:54:38.742
RELY ON. MY INSTAGRAM- THAT ONE

00:54:38.808 --> 00:54:43.980

BASE FUNDING TO GET.

00:54:44.648 --> 00:54:45.749
ACCESSIBILITY TO TRY THOSE. ON

AN ONGOING INITIALLY KNOW THAT

00:54:48.018 --> 00:54:48.918
YOUR FUNDAMENTAL OF THIS

00:54:48.985 --> 00:54:50.754
PROPOSAL IS PROVIDE BOTH

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:53.123
FLEXIBLE AND PERSONAL RESOURCES

00:54:53.189 --> 00:54:54.491
IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE

00:54:54.557 --> 00:54:55.825
STATE'S INVESTMENT BOTH OUR

00:54:55.892 --> 00:54:57.494
PROTECTION. AND FOREST

00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:58.261
MANAGEMENT I THINK IT'S

00:54:58.328 --> 00:55:00.130
IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT

00:55:00.196 --> 00:55:02.432
IT'S REALLY IN BOTH AREAS- ONE

00:55:02.499 --> 00:55:05.035
OF THE KEY IMPORTANT PIECES OF.

00:55:05.101 --> 00:55:07.270
PERMANENT STAFFING. IS THAT

00:55:07.337 --> 00:55:09.205
THEY ARE AVAILABLE IN THE NON

00:55:09.272 --> 00:55:16.212
B. SEASON TWO DUE FOREST. KILLS.

00:55:16.279 --> 00:55:16.813
REDUCTION PROJECTS WERE THERE

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:17.881
BE. CAN HOLD THEM UNION AND

00:55:17.947 --> 00:55:19.482
CLEARING OR PRESCRIBED THE

00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:21.484
OTHER TOOLS AVAILABLE. SO I

00:55:21.551 --> 00:55:22.986
THINK THAT'S REALLY HARD

00:55:23.053 --> 00:55:24.187
FLEXIBILITY IN THE PERSON TOLD

00:55:24.254 --> 00:55:28.658
ME THIS PACKAGE PROVIDES. AND

00:55:28.725 --> 00:55:30.026
THEN LASTLY JUST. IT WAS RIGHT

00:55:30.093 --> 00:55:32.395
AT JUST ABOUT TERM FUNDING WE

00:55:32.462 --> 00:55:34.230
WILL THAT THAT AT THIS POINT

00:55:34.297 --> 00:55:37.033
WOULD COMPROMISE SOME OF THE

00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:38.735
ACCUSATIONS HE'S- AND IT'S YOU.

00:55:38.802 --> 00:55:41.271

00:55:41.337 --> 00:55:43.573
WE HIRE TEMPORARY OR SEASONAL

00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:46.209
WORKERS- THAT HELPS ME KEEP

00:55:46.276 --> 00:55:48.278
FIREMEN ALEXIS JUST TALKING

00:55:48.344 --> 00:55:49.679
ABOUT HAVING THAT WORK FORCE IN

00:55:49.746 --> 00:55:53.116
THE OFF. SEASON TO HELP

00:55:53.183 --> 00:55:54.150
YOURSELF LAST THE BOARD THEY

00:55:54.217 --> 00:55:55.618
NEEDS TO BE DONE WORKFORCE.

00:55:55.685 --> 00:55:59.823
ALSO I THINK ONE OF THE-

00:55:59.889 --> 00:56:01.057
REASONS FOLKS TALK ABOUT

00:56:01.124 --> 00:56:02.926
SEASONAL IS THAT THERE'S A LOT

00:56:02.992 --> 00:56:04.027
OF IT MAYBE IT'S LESS EXPENSIVE

00:56:04.094 --> 00:56:06.262
THAN- HAVING A PERMANENT I

00:56:06.329 --> 00:56:08.164
THINK WITH A NUMBER OF FACTORS

00:56:08.231 --> 00:56:10.834
THAT COME WITH HIRING AND- AND

00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:12.535
DOWN SIZING THE SEASONAL STAFF

00:56:12.602 --> 00:56:13.436
AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT'S

00:56:13.503 --> 00:56:14.838
REALLY NOT. A GREAT DEAL OF

00:56:14.904 --> 00:56:16.539
ACTUAL SAVINGS THAT COMES WITH

00:56:16.606 --> 00:56:21.511
THAT A ROUTE OVER AND- THANKS.

00:56:24.547 --> 00:56:26.483
LOT OF BODIES THAT HAVE LOWER

SKILL LEVEL AND- FOR INSTANCE

00:56:28.718 --> 00:56:31.421
SO THAT THE LATTER SKILLS AND

00:56:31.488 --> 00:56:33.256
TRAINING THAT YOU GET FROM THE

00:56:33.323 --> 00:56:34.991

IT AROUND THEY CAN GET A WHOLE

00:56:47.604 --> 00:56:48.705
BUNCH OF DIFFERENT PIECES OF

THE NEED AND YOU LOSE A BUNCH

BE CONTINUED DISCUSSIONS. ON

01:19:52.487 --> 01:20:00.795
THE PROPOSAL BETWEEN. THE

01:20:00.862 --> 01:20:01.263
ADMINISTRATION AND THE

01:20:01.329 --> 01:20:01.830
LEGISLATURE. WHAT WE DON'T

01:20:01.897 --> 01:20:02.564
THINK IT'S JUST A THIS. BUT

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:04.900
BELIAU ONLINE AT READ. THANK

01:20:04.966 --> 01:20:06.334

WITH THE LEGEND OFFICE- WE HAVE

01:20:09.804 --> 01:20:10.572
THERE ARE A LOT OF MOVING

01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:14.442
PIECES HERE- ON ON THIS I THINK

01:20:14.509 --> 01:20:16.211
THE FIGURE ON PAGE ONE OF SEVEN

01:20:16.278 --> 01:20:17.879
OF YOUR AGENDA IS HELPFUL I

01:20:17.946 --> 01:20:19.214
THINK THERE ARE THREE COMMENTS

01:20:19.281 --> 01:20:20.582
WE WOULD MAKE FOR YOU TO THINK

01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:22.417
ABOUT WITH THIS PROPOSAL. THE

01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:23.885
FIRST IS AROUND THE HABITAT

01:20:23.952 --> 01:20:25.387
CONSERVATION FUND IS THE CHAIR

01:20:25.453 --> 01:20:27.255
MENTIONED AND- THERE WERE A LOT

01:20:27.322 --> 01:20:28.423
OF CONCERNS EXPRESSED ABOUT

01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:30.692
THAT EVEN IN JANUARY WHEN IT

01:20:30.759 --> 01:20:31.393
WAS PROPOSED BECAUSE OF THE

01:20:31.459 --> 01:20:33.094
IMPACT ON WILDLIFE CONSERVATION

01:20:33.161 --> 01:20:34.663
BOARD FROM WHERE THE FUNDS WILL

01:20:34.729 --> 01:20:36.164
BE TRANSFERRED. NOW WITH THE

01:20:36.231 --> 01:20:38.366
FORCES THOUGH FRESH OLD IT GETS

01:20:38.433 --> 01:20:40.969
EVEN HARDER SO- THAT WOULD BE

01:20:41.036 --> 01:20:42.237
THE FIRST IS THAT SOMETHING YOU

01:20:42.304 --> 01:20:43.505
WANT TO PURSUE AND IS THAT

01:20:43.572 --> 01:20:44.539
SOMETHING EVEN FEASIBLE TO

01:20:44.606 --> 01:20:46.808
PURSUE I THINK THE SECOND AS MR

01:20:46.875 --> 01:20:52.247
BROWN. USING RESOURCES THAT IS

01:20:52.314 --> 01:20:53.715
BEING PROPOSED FOR A BASELINE

01:20:53.782 --> 01:20:55.550
KINDS OF THIRTY THREE POINT

01:20:55.617 --> 01:20:57.118
SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS PARKS IS

01:20:57.185 --> 01:20:58.920
THE OTHER WHICH I'LL GET TO IN

01:20:58.987 --> 01:21:00.455
YOUR AGENDA SO IS THAT

01:21:00.522 --> 01:21:01.756
SOMETHING YOU FEEL LIKE YOU

01:21:01.823 --> 01:21:03.692
NEED TO DO YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN A

01:21:03.758 --> 01:21:05.327
LOT OF CLARIFICATION OVER HOW

01:21:05.393 --> 01:21:06.895
THOSE CUTS WOULD BE TAKEN AT

01:21:06.962 --> 01:21:07.562
THE DEPARTMENT THE

01:21:07.629 --> 01:21:08.997
ADMINISTRATION IS SAYING THAT

01:21:09.064 --> 01:21:10.799
THEY WOULD LOOK. AT WAYS

01:21:10.865 --> 01:21:11.967
THROUGH USING THEIR SERVICE

01:21:12.033 --> 01:21:13.268
BASE BUDGET BUT THAT DOESN'T

01:21:13.335 --> 01:21:14.502
PROVIDE YOU A LOT OF

01:21:14.569 --> 01:21:16.338
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE

01:21:16.404 --> 01:21:17.239
IMPACTS OF THESE CUTS WOULD BE

01:21:17.305 --> 01:21:19.007
IF YOU TOOK THEM. AND THEY ARE

01:21:19.074 --> 01:21:20.141
BEING PROPOSED AS PART OF THE

01:21:20.208 --> 01:21:21.643
FEDERAL TRIGGER BUT THAT WOULD

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:23.878
JUST BE IF WE GOT FEDERAL FUNDS

01:21:23.945 --> 01:21:26.047
ONE TIME SO AFTER THE BUDGET

01:21:26.114 --> 01:21:27.115
YEAR THIS WOULD BECOME BASELINE

01:21:27.182 --> 01:21:29.985
CUTS. AND MORE- SIGNIFICANT IF

01:21:30.051 --> 01:21:31.186
YOU DON'T HAVE THE H. C. F.

01:21:31.253 --> 01:21:33.021
TRANSFERRED HELP OFFSET THEM.

01:21:33.088 --> 01:21:35.290
AND THEN THE THIRD ISSUE AS

01:21:35.357 --> 01:21:36.291
NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA THERE ARE

01:21:36.358 --> 01:21:37.959
ACTUALLY SOME AUGMENTATIONS

01:21:38.026 --> 01:21:40.295
BEING PROPOSED HERE AS WEL SIX

01:21:40.362 --> 01:21:41.796
POINT TWO MILLION IN TOTAL FOUR

01:21:41.863 --> 01:21:43.098
MILLION FOR- GETTING CUTTING

01:21:43.164 --> 01:21:45.066
THE GREEN TAPE INITIATIVE. AND

01:21:45.133 --> 01:21:46.534
TWO POINT TWO MILLION FOR LANCE

01:21:46.601 --> 01:21:48.603
MANAGEMENT WELL THOSE EFFORTS

01:21:48.670 --> 01:21:49.971
MAY HAVE A LOT OF MERIT AND

01:21:50.038 --> 01:21:51.606
THEY'RE NOT HUGE DOLLAR AMOUNTS

01:21:51.673 --> 01:21:53.208
YOU KNOW WE JUST WOULD WANT YOU

01:21:53.275 --> 01:21:54.276
TO THINK ABOUT IT DOESN'T MAKE

01:21:54.342 --> 01:21:56.177
SENSE TO AUGMENT PROGRAMS AT

01:21:56.244 --> 01:21:57.579
THE SAME TIME. YOU'RE BEING

01:21:57.646 --> 01:21:59.881
PROPOSED TO CUT PROGRAMS AND

01:21:59.948 --> 01:22:01.383
ESSENTIALLY IT'S PRIORITIZING

01:22:01.449 --> 01:22:03.285
NEW EXPANDED EFFORTS OVER SOME

01:22:03.351 --> 01:22:07.889
EXISTING EFFORTS AND IS THAT-

01:22:07.956 --> 01:22:08.523
AND APPROACH YOU WANT TO TAKE.

01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:09.724
DIRECTED BY. HOLDING OFF ON THE

01:22:09.791 --> 01:22:11.259
BASELINE CUTS FOR A MINUTE CAN

01:22:11.326 --> 01:22:13.795
YOU ADDRESS THE- THE CUTTING

01:22:13.862 --> 01:22:18.300
GREEN TAPE AND- THE- THE- FUND

01:22:18.366 --> 01:22:20.135
LAND MANAGEMENT AUGMENTATIONS.

01:22:20.201 --> 01:22:22.137
MR GOOD MORNING IT'S NICE TO

01:22:22.203 --> 01:22:23.672
SEE YOU AND ALL THE MEMBERS

01:22:23.738 --> 01:22:27.208
EVEN UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES.

01:22:27.275 --> 01:22:29.444
SO LET ME FIRST START WITH THE

01:22:29.511 --> 01:22:32.414
CUTTING THE GREEN TAPE CONCEPT

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:34.449
WHICH IS A FOUR MILLION DOLLAR

01:22:34.516 --> 01:22:37.152
CONTINUATION OF A PROPOSAL

01:22:37.218 --> 01:22:37.686
COMING OUT OF THE JANUARY

01:22:37.752 --> 01:22:40.588
BUDGET. THIS IS GOOD WORK IT'S

01:22:40.655 --> 01:22:42.891
SMART WORK IT ACTUALLY MAY BE

01:22:42.957 --> 01:22:45.093
MORE STRATEGIC WORK NOW IF ONE

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:46.828
THINKS ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF

01:22:46.895 --> 01:22:49.264
FUTURE STIMULUS. RESTARTING THE

01:22:49.331 --> 01:22:52.033
ECONOMY AND PUTTING ENERGY INTO

01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:54.436
GREEN JOBS. WHAT WE FIND IS

01:22:54.502 --> 01:22:56.237
THAT APARTMENT IS WHERE ONE OF

01:22:56.304 --> 01:22:59.174
THE- GATEWAY FUNDERS FOR

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:00.642
RESTORATION WORK ACROSS THE

01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:03.244
WORLD LANDSCAPE AS WELL AS A

01:23:03.311 --> 01:23:06.214
PRIMARY PERMIT OR OF THOSE

01:23:06.281 --> 01:23:08.717
RESTORATION PROJECTS THE THINGS

01:23:08.783 --> 01:23:10.585
THAT MAKE A RIVER HEALTHIER.

01:23:10.652 --> 01:23:12.487
THE THINGS THAT OUR INVESTMENTS

01:23:12.554 --> 01:23:14.189
TO BRING BACK OUR SALMON THE

01:23:14.255 --> 01:23:15.857
THINGS THAT ARE FOR RESTORING

01:23:15.924 --> 01:23:18.059
WETLANDS SO THIS FOUR MILLION

01:23:18.126 --> 01:23:20.095
DOLLARS. WOULD ALLOW US TO

01:23:20.161 --> 01:23:22.397
INCREASE THE SCALE AND PACE OF

01:23:22.464 --> 01:23:24.599
RESTORATION WORK. INCORPORATE

01:23:24.666 --> 01:23:26.134
INEFFICIENCIES INTO OUR GRANT

01:23:26.201 --> 01:23:28.703
MAKING SO WE CAN KEEP. MOVING

01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:30.872
PROPOSITION FUNDS OUT TO OUR

01:23:30.939 --> 01:23:33.108
NONPROFIT AND TRIBAL PARTNERS

01:23:33.174 --> 01:23:35.176
AND PURSUE PROGRAMMATIC

01:23:35.243 --> 01:23:38.279
PERMITTING OPTIONS THEY CAN GET

01:23:38.346 --> 01:23:38.813
ALL OF THIS GOOD WORK DONE

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:41.349
FASTER. NOW IT MAY SEEM LIKE

01:23:41.416 --> 01:23:42.984
IT'S NEW WORK BUT WE DO A LOT

01:23:43.051 --> 01:23:44.419
OF THIS WORK ALREADY AND I

01:23:44.486 --> 01:23:46.221
WOULD ARGUE IT'S POSSIBLE THE

01:23:46.287 --> 01:23:47.422
FOUR MILLION DOLLARS BECOMES AN

01:23:47.489 --> 01:23:50.091
OPTIMIZATION. RATHER THAN AN

01:23:50.158 --> 01:23:51.926
ENTIRELY NEW KIND OF WAR.

01:23:51.993 --> 01:23:53.395
THAT'S THE CUTTING THE GREEN

01:23:53.461 --> 01:23:57.132
TAPE ASPECT. ON THE LANDS FRONT

01:23:57.198 --> 01:23:58.099
THE TWO POINT TWO MILLION

01:23:58.166 --> 01:24:00.301
DOLLARS IN MY JUDGMENT IS A

01:24:00.368 --> 01:24:02.537
PRUDENT INVESTMENT NO MATTER

01:24:02.604 --> 01:24:04.572
THE ECONOMIC CLIMATE HERE'S WHY.

01:24:04.639 --> 01:24:06.174
OUR DEPARTMENT OWNS AND MANAGES

01:24:06.241 --> 01:24:08.376
ABOUT A MILLION ACRES ONE OF

01:24:08.443 --> 01:24:09.778
THE THINGS WE SEE FROM OUR

01:24:09.844 --> 01:24:11.346
SERVICE BASED BUDGETING EFFORT

01:24:11.413 --> 01:24:13.782
IS ARE. LESS THAN SUPERIOR

01:24:13.848 --> 01:24:15.583
ABILITY TO MANAGE THOSE LANDS

01:24:15.650 --> 01:24:17.552
FOR THEIR FUTURE USE. THEIR

01:24:17.619 --> 01:24:19.487
CLIMATE UP THE ADAPTABILITY

01:24:19.554 --> 01:24:21.723
THEIR RESILIENCY THIS TWO POINT

01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:23.324
TWO MILLION DOLLARS WITH LET US

01:24:23.391 --> 01:24:25.260
KEEP DOING IMPORTANT LANCE

01:24:25.326 --> 01:24:26.261
MAINTENANCE OF OUR OWN

01:24:26.327 --> 01:24:28.863
PROPERTIES WITH AN EYE TOWARDS

01:24:28.930 --> 01:24:31.900
THAT CLIMB. HI EXCELLENT WITH

01:24:31.966 --> 01:24:32.801
THE SUBCOMMITTEE HAS SPENT

01:24:32.867 --> 01:24:34.903
SOME. HOURS ON THAT SERVICE

01:24:34.969 --> 01:24:37.238
SPACE- MANAGEMENT AND I KNOW

01:24:37.305 --> 01:24:38.406
THAT ALL THE MEMBERS KNOW MORE

01:24:38.473 --> 01:24:41.576
ABOUT A GAUGE STREAM- TESTING

01:24:41.643 --> 01:24:42.677
THEN THEY THEY THOUGHT THEY

01:24:42.744 --> 01:24:43.845
WOULD HAVE KNOWN ALL RIGHT

01:24:43.912 --> 01:24:46.347
MEMBERS DON'T SEE ANY. COMMENTS

01:24:46.414 --> 01:24:49.851
CENTER STERN JUST VERY BRIEFLY-

01:24:49.918 --> 01:24:52.787
I KNOW WE TOUCHED ON THE- GREEN

01:24:52.854 --> 01:24:55.256
TAPE INITIATIVE BUT- HI THIS IS

01:24:55.323 --> 01:24:56.624
A BIT OF A HOBSON'S CHOICE HERE

01:24:56.691 --> 01:24:58.226
AT NIGHT IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE

01:24:58.293 --> 01:24:59.761
WE HAVE ONE ALTHOUGH THE FOUR

01:24:59.828 --> 01:25:02.397
FIFTHS VOTE THRESHOLD DOES END

01:25:02.464 --> 01:25:05.867
UP BECOMING VALIDATED THEN

01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:06.935
THAT'LL OBVIOUSLY GIVE THE

01:25:07.001 --> 01:25:08.369
LEGISLATURE AN OPPORTUNITY-

01:25:08.436 --> 01:25:10.138
PINE ON RESCINDING THE WILL OF

01:25:10.205 --> 01:25:11.272
THE VOTERS TO FULLY FUND THE

01:25:11.339 --> 01:25:13.074
HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND THAT

01:25:13.141 --> 01:25:14.943
pTHE LEGISLATURE ALSO SPOKE LAST

01:25:15.009 --> 01:25:15.610
YEAR AND IT SEEMS TO

01:25:15.677 --> 01:25:18.446
CONTRAVENE. OUR INTENT AND IT'S

01:25:18.513 --> 01:25:20.882
NO. DIRECT CRITIQUE OF DIRECTOR

01:25:20.949 --> 01:25:22.951
BONHAM OR CDFW IN FACT YOU GUYS

01:25:23.017 --> 01:25:25.920
ARE STILL UNDER RESOURCE. BUT

01:25:25.987 --> 01:25:27.689
ROBBING FROM PETER TO PAY PAUL

01:25:27.755 --> 01:25:29.791
OR TO KEEP ALL THESE PROGRAMS

01:25:29.858 --> 01:25:32.060
UP AND RUNNING SEEMS LIKE A

01:25:32.126 --> 01:25:34.028
FALSE CHOICE AT THIS POINT SO I

01:25:34.095 --> 01:25:35.864
I'D LOVE TO SEE. SOME FUTURE

01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:37.899
CONSIDERATION OF RESTORING

THESE FUNDS- AND REALLY

01:25:40.068 --> 01:25:41.269
VALIDATING THESE PROGRAMS FOR

01:25:41.336 --> 01:25:42.504
THE CRITICAL IMPACT THEY HAVE

01:25:42.570 --> 01:25:44.539

CALIFORNIA OVER THE NEXT DECADE

01:25:48.543 --> 01:25:50.178
BUT- THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE

01:25:50.245 --> 01:25:51.513
PERFECTLY GOOD CHOICE EITHER.

01:25:51.579 --> 01:25:52.647
THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO

01:25:52.714 --> 01:25:55.316

DECLINES IN REVENUE ASSOCIATED

01:26:51.272 --> 01:26:53.875
WITH THE WHITE CLOSURES- THE

01:26:53.942 --> 01:26:55.243
EXACT IMPACT OF THESE

01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:57.278
REDUCTIONS IS THAT I KNOW NOW

01:26:57.345 --> 01:26:59.447
I'M OF COURSE BECAUSE IT'S ALSO

01:26:59.514 --> 01:27:00.915

01:27:03.318 --> 01:27:04.552
RESTRICTIONS IN A MANNER THAT

01:27:04.619 --> 01:27:06.888
STILL CONSISTENT WITH PUBLIC-

01:27:06.955 --> 01:27:09.490
HELLO ORDERS AND AN ACCIDENT

01:27:09.557 --> 01:27:11.459

CHANNEL FIND REDUCTION- THAT

01:27:17.365 --> 01:27:19.267
WOULD BE A TRIGGER REDUCTION AS

01:27:19.334 --> 01:27:23.771
NOTED AND- DOT INSTEAD SIMPLY

01:27:23.838 --> 01:27:24.572
TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT

01:27:24.639 --> 01:27:27.108
ADDITIONAL- ONGOING EXPENDITURE

01:27:27.175 --> 01:27:27.809

LOCAL FEDERAL AND COPPER. AND

01:27:41.155 --> 01:27:42.924
USING SERVICE BUDGETING MODEL

01:27:42.991 --> 01:27:44.025

01:27:48.396 --> 01:27:48.930
THE THINK THAT MILLION THIS

01:27:48.997 --> 01:27:51.866
YEAR AS OF OR IS IT AT THE

01:27:51.933 --> 01:27:52.367
CEILING OR SOMEWHERE IN

01:27:52.433 --> 01:27:55.069

01:27:58.640 --> 01:27:59.607
DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND

01:27:59.674 --> 01:28:01.843
RECREATION A RIGHT NOW TO TRY

01:28:01.909 --> 01:28:04.012
TO GET MORE INFORMATION ON. AND

01:28:04.078 --> 01:28:06.314
IN A TYPICAL YEAR HOW MUCH OF

01:28:06.381 --> 01:28:07.482
THE REVENUES INTO THE STATE

01:28:07.548 --> 01:28:08.883
PARKS AND RECREATION FIND HIGH

01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:11.986
MAN FINE LINE. AND IT'S NOT AN

01:28:12.053 --> 01:28:15.390
UNREASONABLE AMOUNT AND GIVEN

01:28:15.456 --> 01:28:16.724
THAT MOST OF THE REVENUES THAT

01:28:16.791 --> 01:28:18.393
CURRYING ARE GOING TO BE IN THE

01:28:18.459 --> 01:28:20.728
SPRING AND SUMMER AND FALL

01:28:20.795 --> 01:28:22.563
MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR WE DO

01:28:22.630 --> 01:28:24.632
THINK THAT THERE IS LIKELY TO

01:28:24.699 --> 01:28:26.167
BE SOME MORE INFORMATION THAT

01:28:26.234 --> 01:28:27.402
COMES TO LIGHT IN THE COMING

01:28:27.468 --> 01:28:29.203

REFINE THE ESTIMATE AND IT'S

01:28:31.439 --> 01:28:33.941
POSSIBLE IT COULD BE SOMEWHAT

01:28:34.008 --> 01:28:35.677
LAST IT COULD BE HIGHER AND-

01:28:35.743 --> 01:28:37.512
BUT IT'S POSSIBLE IT COULD BE

01:28:37.578 --> 01:28:38.646
LESS AS WELL WHICH MIGHT BE

01:28:38.713 --> 01:28:39.881
ABLE TO FREE UP SOME OF THE

01:28:39.947 --> 01:28:41.049
RESOURCES THAT HAVE BEEN

01:28:41.115 --> 01:28:43.217
SATISFIED- BEFORE BOTH THE

01:28:43.284 --> 01:28:44.419
CURRENT YEAR AND THE BUDGET

01:28:44.485 --> 01:28:45.753
YOUR PERKS BACKFILL THAT

01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:47.221
CERTAINLY THE CURRENT YEAR

01:28:47.288 --> 01:28:47.955
THERE SHOULD BE MORE

01:28:48.022 --> 01:28:49.424

01:29:00.935 --> 01:29:01.836
LANGUAGE IN JULY WE'LL HAVE A

01:29:01.903 --> 01:29:03.705
BETTER IDEA OF HOW THAT SEASON

01:29:03.771 --> 01:29:06.240
IS GOING AROUND. THE RECOVERY-

01:29:06.307 --> 01:29:07.909
LOOKS LIKE AT LEAST FIFTY PARKS

01:29:07.975 --> 01:29:12.180
PEOPLE. GOING OUT TO THE PARKS.

01:29:12.246 --> 01:29:14.649

CUT SO YES WE ARE AND SO JUST

01:29:22.056 --> 01:29:23.858
TO KNOW THAT IT'S PROPOSED FOR

AND WELL IT'S DESCRIBED IN THE

01:29:29.230 --> 01:29:30.698
BUDGET SUMMARY THERE DOES NOT

01:29:30.765 --> 01:29:32.066

ADDITION THAT THAT TRIGGERING

01:29:37.505 --> 01:29:39.273
OFF MECHANISM RELATED TO

01:33:58.099 --> 01:33:59.300
INTO AT LEAST IN THE NORTHERN

01:33:59.367 --> 01:34:00.835
PART OF THE STATE THE IN THE

OPEN PEOPLE CAN USE THEM TO

01:34:05.006 --> 01:34:07.775

DIFFICULT TO TRY TO BUDGET

01:34:13.447 --> 01:34:14.548
BETTER SCENARIO WHEN YOU DON'T

01:34:14.615 --> 01:34:16.150
KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE

01:34:16.217 --> 01:34:19.653
BUT THE QUESTION I HAVE IS SO.

01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:20.755

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT KICK IN

01:34:35.970 --> 01:34:36.704

01:34:48.816 --> 01:34:49.583
SOMETHING THAT MAYBE THE

01:34:49.650 --> 01:34:51.318
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I CAN

01:34:51.385 --> 01:34:52.653

THE REVISION. WHO DETERMINES.

01:35:23.651 --> 01:35:26.921
