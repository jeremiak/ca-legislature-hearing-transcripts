THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THE- COMMITTEE ON THE MOTION THE SECOND- I INTRODUCED AB FIFTY FIVE AT THE REQUEST OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. IT WOULD ESTABLISH CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN DAY AS A PAID HOLIDAY FOR CALIFORNIA COURTS WITHOUT INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PAID COURT HOLIDAYS. JUDICIAL COUNCIL EMPLOYEES ARE COVERED UNDER A SEPARATE CODE SECTION. IN OTHER STATE WORKERS THEREFORE THIS IS EXCLUSIVE TO THEM. CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN DAY IS ALREADY A STATE HOLIDAY. I LOBBIED IT IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT WITH AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER JOE BACA. BUT IT'S AN UNPAID HOLIDAY AND WHAT THE JUDICIAL COURTS IS DOING IS EXCHANGING HER COLUMBUS DAY. AND CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN DAY FOR THE PAID HOLIDAY. AND FOR MANY TOWARDS MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS I HAVE WORKED TOWARDS CREATING A PAID STATE HOLIDAY TO RECOGNIZE AND LEARN ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE. CONTINUING TO WORK TO EDUCATE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS WITH HOW HELP TO MOVE THAT FORWARD WHEN A ONE EXAMPLE IS MANY OF THE HIGHWAYS THAT WE TRAVEL OR ONCE INDIAN TRAILS AND NOW WE TRAVEL THOSE ROADS. IN MY AREA AND REDLANDS THE INDIAN PEOPLE SERRANO CAREER GABRIELLE PEOPLE HELP TO DIG DESIGN OTHER BROUGHT WATER INTO RESIDENTS THAT HAVE THAT COMMUNITY FLOURISH.

THE PROCESS FOR SURVIVORS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING BEGIN TO HAVE THEIR RECORDS CLEARED ALSO KNOWN AS THEY GET YOUR RELIEF. CURRENT LAW CREATES A CATCH TWENTY TWO THAT MAKES IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR SURVIVORS TO CLEAR THEIR CRIMINAL. RECORD SURVIVORS OFTEN HAVE TO PAY ALL FINES BEETLE PROBATION REQUIREMENTS BEFORE THEY CAN EVEN ASK A COURT TO CLEAR THEIR CRIMINAL RECORD OF NONVIOLENT. OFFENSES WITHOUT A- CLEAR- RECORD EMPLOYMENT IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT EMPLOYMENT PAYING A FEE TO THE COURT AS A BARRIER THAT PREVENTS MANY SURVIVORS. FROM EVEN TRYING TO CLEAR THEIR RECORDS SO THE BILL WOULD PREVENT A COURT FROM REFUSING TO HEAR A HUMAN TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS PETITION- FOR REC. RECORD CLEARANCE DUE TO UNPAID FINES OR FEES IT ALSO WOULD GIVE SURVIVORS THE ABILITY TO PETITION FOR VACATION RELIEF AT ANYTIME AFTER THEY ARE REMOVED. FROM TRAFFICKING CURRENT LAW HIS AMBIGUOUS AS TO HOW MUCH TIME- PAST IS REASONABLE. AB TWO SIX TWO IS SEEKING A CLEARER PATH WITH MORE CERTAINTY. FOR SURVIVORS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING.
