THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THIS WILL BE AND IS ONE OF THE LOW WELL CITIES IT REALLY STRUGGLES. EVEN THOUGH IT HAS A FAIRLY DECENT PROPERTY TAX BASE GIVEN THE CURRENT STRUCTURE THEY GET VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THAT. THAT THE CITY HAS LONG BEEN VERY. VERY FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE AND HOW IT MANAGES ITS FINANCES AND IN FACT IS GOING TO GO THROUGH A BUDGETING PROCESS COMING UP. AND HAS ASKED ME TO BRING THIS BILL FORWARD SO THAT WE CAN THEY CAN LOOK AT THIS. SALES TAX AS A POTENTIAL TOOL AS THEY FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE MANAGING THEIR BUDGET PROVIDING THE SERVICES THAT ARE EXPECTED BY THEIR CONSTITUENCIES. THIS IS IN THE SAME FORM AS OTHER BILLS SIMILAR THEY'RE ABOUT TO THIS COMMITTEE WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTES AND I HAVE WITH ME JIM READ. WHO IS A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER AS SEVERAL TIME MAYOR OF THE CITY OF SCOTTS VALLEY LONG STANDING? LOCAL COMMUNITY MEMBER AND MEMBER OF THE CITY COUNCIL AND WHO HAS BEEN A VERY SIGNIFICANT PART OF MANAGING THE CITY AND BROUGHT THIS BILL TO MY ATTENTION THE NEED FOR THIS BILL TO MY ATTENTION [inaudible] THANK YOU. I QUITE. SO IT MARK PUT IT VERY WELL WE ARE LOW WELL CITY -- WE ONLY GET BACK ABOUT SIX AND A HALF PERCENT OF OUR PROPERTY TAX REVENUE. AND WE'VE HAD SEVERAL TIMES IN THE PAST WHERE BECAUSE WE YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE AUTO DEALERSHIPS IN OUR TIME WE DON'T HAVE A LARGE MALL WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TRADITIONALLY LARGE SALES TAX GENERATORS. SO WHEN TIMES ARE REALLY GOOD WE DON'T SEE A SPIKE THE LOT OF JURISDICTIONS TO WERE JUST FLAT. AND SO EVEN IN THE CON TO BE LIKE THIS DESPITE US BEING VERY VERY FRUGAL -- ANYTIME AN EMPLOYEE LEAVES FIGHT NATURAL ATTRITION WE TRY NOT TO REPLACE THEM -- WE'VE GOT ABOUT I THINK ABOUT 2025% LIGHTER -- AND STAFFING THAT WE WERE JUST FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WE'RE NOT ABLE TO MAKE ENDS MEET -- THIS BEEN A PERENNIAL PROBLEM FOR US IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE OUR ANSWER WAS TO DO A TEMPORARY FIVE YEAR QUARTER CENT SALES TAX WE WENT OUT TO THE VOTERS WITH. WE GOT 72% ON THAT WE LET IT EXPIRE WE HOPE WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH SOME ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES THAT WOULD ENABLE US TO RIGHT THE SHIP FISCALLY. THOSE DIDN'T COME TO PASS LARGELY BECAUSE THE ECONOMY SO INTO TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY THIRTEEN EXCUSE ME WE WENT OUT FOR A SEVEN YEAR HALF CENT. SALES TAX. AND AGAIN WE ENGAGED COMMUNITY ENOUGH HONEST CONVERSATION HERE THE SERVICES THAT WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE YOU TODAY. WE DON'T SEE ANY OF ANY PLACE MORE THAN WE CAN CUT WE'VE LAID OFF PEOPLE WHEN TIMES ARE BAD WE'VE CUT THIS CORNER THAT CORNER BUT WE DON'T THINK WE CAN CUT ANYMORE WITHOUT CUTTING BONE AND MUSCLE. AND WE'VE INVITED THE COMMUNITY COME LOOK AT OUR BOOKS TELL US A FOR MISSING SOMETHING AND WE HAD VERY STRONG SWEET COMMITTEE SUPPORT. FOR THAT MEASURE WE GOT ASSEMBLYMEMBERS SAID WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LOOK AT ANOTHER OPTION I THINK POTENTIALLY GOING UP TO THREE QUARTERS OF A CENT. IT'S NOT DEFINITE YET -- WILL KNOW THAT AT THE END OF OUR BUDGET PROCESS -- IN MAY OR JUNE BUT PERSONALLY I THINK IT'S BEEN FAR MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED THAT THREE QUARTERS SENT. TO OUR COMMUNITY CAN CONTINUE TO ENJOY THE SERVICES THAT WE HAVE TODAY -- SO IF WE JUST HAVE THE ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN THAT HONEST CONVERSATION WITH OUR ELECTORATE ABOUT THE PLUSES AND MINUSES OF THIS ADDITIONAL REVENUE AND WHAT IT'LL GO -- FOR WE THINK THE IT WOULD BE A GREAT SERVICE -- TO TO OUR CONSTITUENTS WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR BRING THIS UP IN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. YOU'RE VERY WELCOME THANK YOU -- FOR TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT AND WE SEE OUR LOCALS COME AND TESTIFY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THING OTHER THAN THE OPPOSITION WHAT KIND OF COURSE? MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON DAVID WOLF THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION TO YOU AB SIX ONE EIGHT AND MEMBERS WE'VE -- SALES TAX AUTHORIZATION BILLS LIKE THIS -- ONE FOR AS LONG AS THE TWELVE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN AT HOWARD JARVIS ANYTHING EVEN NOW LISTEN THIS DOES A BY BY LOCAL VOTER APPROVAL AND OBVIOUSLY WE'RE VERY. PLEASED BY THAT WE'RE CONCERNED BECAUSE WE'RE DEALING WITH PROGRESSIVE SALES TAX -- AUTHORIZATIONS HERE SCOTTS VALLEY HAS A 9% SALES TAX RATE -- ONE OF THE HIGHEST IN THE STATE CERTAINLY IN THE TOP 20% OF ALL OF THE JURISDICTIONS THAT ACTUALLY AUTHOR IS SALES TAXES IN CALIFORNIA. AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT CONSUMER SPENDING MAKES UP -- ABOUT 70% OF THE NATION'S ECONOMIC OUTPUT AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VERY REGRESSIVE TAX INCREASES HERE -- AUTHORIZATIONS OF THIS KIND ARE VERY CONCERNING TO US AND YOU KNOW WE UNDERSTAND COMMUNITIES NEED MORE MONEY -- AND YOU KNOW WE'RE SYMPATHETIC TO THAT OBVIOUSLY UP TO A POINT BUT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER A LOT OF THIS MONEY IS GOING TO GO TO UNFUNDED PENSION LIABILITIES ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A GENERAL TAX WHICH WE ARE HERE. THERE'S NO REASON THAT THIS FUNDS CAN'T BE SPENT FOR ANYTHING INCLUDING UNFUNDED PENSION LIABILITIES. AND WE JUST THINK DEALING WITH PROGRESSIVE TAXES OF THIS TYPE FOR THAT PURPOSES UNWISE SO FOR THOSE REASONS ASPIRIN OF A THANK YOU VERY MUCH EITHER IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. IF YOU LIKE TO COME UP TO THE MICROPHONE. PARKING IS HORRENDOUS I JUST GO HERE. YEAH THE NO IT SHOULD BE ON RIGHT. AND THEN AS WE LOOK IT UP JUST LIKE THAT. I'M IN A POSITION I I ASSUME WE'RE STILL IN A CA ONE NO. THOUGH THIS IS. ANOTHER BILL I SAW MR WEALTH HERE AND FIGURED THIS WAS THE ONE AND PARKING IS THE PITS OUT THERE THANK YOU. HE'LL BE HERE FOR AWHILE TODAY. OKAY IS THE WHAT. ANY OTHER OPPOSITION FOR ABC SIX EIGHTEEN THING NONE. MEMBERS DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. I HAVE A MOTION [inaudible] SECOND IT. HEY WE HAVE A MORE SECOND ANY QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE I WOULD. BUT OF SHARON AND JUST BRIEFLY I FIND THE OPPOSITION A LITTLE BIT DISINGENUOUS. YES SALES TAXES ARE REGRESSIVE ABSOLUTELY AND IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE AN HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT SALES TAX IN THE AFFECTED SALES TAXES. THE REASON THE RATE IS SO HIGH IS THE SALES AND USE TAX WAS PUT IN PLACE WHEN WE WERE PROBABLY NOW SIT CALIFORNIA'S PROBABLY SO THOUGH THE RATE GOES UP BECAUSE THE BASE HAS GONE DOWN AND IF BY THEIR CONCERN FOR A REGRESSIVE TAX THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION SAYING WE SHOULD LOOK AT MAKING. SALES AND USE TAX LESS REGRESSIVE BY TAXING ACROSS THE ECONOMY I WOULD WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE AND I'M HOPING THAT THEY'LL BE A PARTNER TO HELP US ADDRESS THE REQUESTED MISS OF THAT. OTHER THAN THAT WE HAVE REMOVED FROM LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MANY OF THE LEVERS THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO FUNCTION AND TO OPERATE WE EVER SEVERELY RESTRICTED. THEIR ABILITY TO RAISE AND TAKE BENEFIT OF THEIR LOCAL PROPERTY TAXES IS ONE PROP THIRTEEN WAS PUT INTO PLACE CITIES LIKE SCOTTS VALLEY WHICH ARE VERY SMALL IN IN A RURAL AREA. HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE GROWTH OF THE VALUE OF THEIR PROPERTIES OVER THE YEARS BECAUSE OF THESE RULES THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE AND REALLY STRANGLED CITIES. SO THAT THIS IS A CITY THAT HAS BEEN FISCALLY VERY RESPONSIBLE OF A CITY THAT HAS ALWAYS GONE OUT TO THE VOTERS IN A TRANSPARENT WAY. ALL WE'RE ASKING HERE TODAY IS THAT WE ALLOW THE VOTERS THEMSELVES TO ASK THE QUESTION OF THEMSELVES THAN HOLD THEIR CIVIC LEADERS ACCOUNTABLE. TO THE TO THE DECISION OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT. TO RAISE THE SALES TAX NOW THEY WOULD I'M SURE LOVE TO NOT HAVE TO USE THIS PARTICULAR LEVER. BUT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OTHERS WE'VE HAD BETWEEN THE CITY IN THE COUNTY. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME DISPUTES BACK AND FORTH BECAUSE HE'S BEEN TRYING TO PROTECT ITSELF AND ITS ABILITY TO TAKE ITS FAIR SHARE. OF THAT PROPERTY TAX REVENUES BUT UNDER THE EXISTING STRUCTURE THAT HAS PROVEN IMPOSSIBLE TO DO. SO WE HAVE TO PROVIDE SOME RELIEF SOMEWHERE. THIS IS THE ONLY LEVER THAT THEY HAVE I ASKED FOR IT I VOTE TO GIVE SCOTTS VALLEY THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRY AND HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD MANNER WITH THEIR CONSTITUENCIES AND BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THEIR PHYSICAL NEEDS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I ASKED FOR AND I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY I SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF THE COMMUNITY.

AND WE HAVE OTHER WITNESSES WITH US. WILL WEIGH IN THE FLICK. YES BEFORE YOU START OKAY I WANT REMIND YOU GET TWO PEOPLE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH I FORGOT THANK YOU MISSION. A MAN CHAIRED MEMBERS -- DICK YOU'RE GONNA BE AWFULLY CALIFORNIA CITIES -- YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN WORKING FOR THE WEEK FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS BUT WHEN I STARTED RANCHO CORDOVA WAS ACTUALLY IN THE PROCESS OF THE RESIDENTS RUSHED OR GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS OF TRYING TO INCORPORATE SO. IT'S BEEN SOMETHING THAT I'VE I'VE SEEN ALL THROUGHOUT MY CAREER -- THE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY IT DURING THE RECESSION -- THERE WAS A A TRAILER BILL THAT WENT THROUGH WITHOUT REALLY A LOT OF REVIEW IT ONE OF THE THINGS IT IT THE THAT IT DID WAS IT TOOK AWAY -- THAT REALLY THE THE THE FOUNDATIONAL OF FINANCING ARM ON THE THAT IS WAS AVAILABLE TO IN CORPORATIONS PRIOR TO THAT DATE -- TWO YEARS AGO AS PART OF A LEGISLATIVE DECISION THERE WAS A A FIX THERE WERE FOUR RECENTLY INCORPORATED CITIES THAT WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HARMED BY THAT BY THAT TRAILER BILL THERE WAS A FIX IT ALL THE LEGISLATORS AGREE. TO ALL THIS BILL DOES IS GIVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY FOR FUTURE COMMUNITIES TO TO USE THE SAME METHOD -- THAT WAS APPROVED FOR THE FOR CITIES -- IN ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO BY THE UNANIMOUSLY BY THE LEGISLATURE BUT THIS ISN'T A ON A SILVER BULLET. EVEN IF THIS ALL OF THIS BILL IS PASSED IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT SOME OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE REPRESENTED YEAR OLD WHO ACTUALLY ACHIEVING CORPORATION THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER HOOPS AND HURDLES THEY'VE GOT TO GO THROUGH. BUT IT LEAST GETS THEM BACK TO A LEAST AT THE STARTING POINT THAT THEY HAD -- PRIOR TO THE TRAILER BILL AND AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS -- IT AND FOR ALL THE COMMUNITIES -- THAT ARE HERE ON THE TABLE THERE REALLY ALL LOOKING FOR SELF GOVERNMENT FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVE SERVED ON CITY COUNCILS AND BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS YOU UNDERSTAND THE THE VALUE OF THAT AND AND THERE ARE. YOU KNOW LOOK AT LOOKING TO AT LEAST HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO HAVE THE SAME -- SAME OPPORTUNITY -- TO TO TO GATHER COMMUNITIES HAVE MORE SELF GOVERNMENT -- THAT THAT YEAH YOU DID AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR THOSE REASONS WE SUPPORT -- LET ME ASK FOR THE LADIES TO SPEAK AS THE MEN OF HAD THE SHOW SO FAR. THANK YOU FOR BEING SO OBSERVER MISTER. I'M NOT A KNUCKLE HEAD. ALL THE TIME. OKAY GOOD GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TIME TODAY MY NAME IS SERRA RAYMOND'S I'M A RESIDENT OF ONE OF THESE ARE MANY UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITIES. I'M NOT SURE THAT MATTERS WHICH WON THE SUFFICE IT TO SAY MIND COMPRISES OVER SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE -- THERE ARE OVER SIX MILLION PEOPLE LIKE ME IN CALIFORNIA LIVING IN UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITIES WITHOUT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITHOUT ANY SORT OF ELECTED REPRESENTATION DIRECT TO THEIR COMMUNITIES -- LIVING WITHOUT THAT SORT OF ON COURT. WITHOUT A CORPORATION IN OUR COMMUNITIES IT'S UNDEMOCRATIC ITS DIFFERENCES IT DOESN'T FRANCHISING IT MEANS WE DON'T HAVE LOCAL ELECTED GOVERNMENT FROM MILLIONS OF US HERE IN CALIFORNIA I'M. IT MEANS THAT RED TAPE -- IS HIGHER FOR US IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND FEWER LOCAL IDEAS COME TO FRUITION IN OUR COMMUNITY IF. IT TAKES RESOURCES FROM OUR COMMUNITIES AND RESIDENTS TO COUNTIES PRIORITIES WHICH OFTEN DON'T MATCH WITH OUR DIRECT PRIORITIES IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS HAS GOT TO CHANGE -- MILLIONS OF US ARE LIVING WITH THESE SYSTEMS BECAUSE THE FUNDING STREAM -- THAT PREVIOUSLY SUPPORTED IN CORPORATIONS TAKING AWAY FROM OFF AND THIS BILL PROVIDES A MUCH NEEDED LEGISLATIVE FIX WITH OUR WHAT WE SEE OF MINIMAL IF IN. A MINIMAL FISCAL IMPACT ON THE REST OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TIME. IF I MAY JUMP IN JUST FOR A MOMENT AND WHEN I AM GOING TO ASK EACH PERSON IDENTIFY YOURSELF -- I OF COURSE RECOGNIZES YOU ALL DO IN MY COLLEAGUES FROM -- SAM BIRD IN A COUNTY BOARD SUPERVISORS THERE IS LOCAL GOVERNMENT A FORM OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS FOR THESE COMMUNITIES.

ONLY ONE REPRESENTS OUR COMMUNITY DONDE TOLD A GREAT GUY BUT HE ACTUALLY HAS THE BIGGEST DISTRICT IN THE COUNTY. SO ON ANY GIVEN DAY WE ONLY HAVE A PIECE OF DONNA TOLL IS FOCUS. BECAUSE IT JUST WAS SO LARGE. ANY OTHER AS TO THE OTHER FOR THEIR ONLY THINKING ABOUT RICHARD OVER IN A IN A SORT OF PER FOR A WAY. TO THEIR DISTRICTS. SO IT'S NOT THAT THERE IS NOT THAT REPRESENTATION BUT CITY HOOD AFFORDS A CONCENTRATED FOCUS ON THE FUTURE. FIVE PEOPLE ALL THE TIME IF THAT'S THE NUMBER YOU HAVE -- AND IT'S SO IT IS A DIFFERENCE IN QUALITY. WHICH IS WHY TO ME CITY WHO IS ALL ABOUT BRINGING YOUR FUTURE HOME RIGHT THERE IN THE BORDERS.

WELCOME MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU RUNNING UP AND DOWN THE STAIRS I AM OUT OF BREATH AND OUT OF SHAPE. SO -- BUT I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE -- WITH ALL OF YOU AND I HIT A PRESENT SENATE BILL. TWELVE FIFTY THREE A GOOD GOVERNMENT BILL SEEKING TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCIES IN THE DELIVERY OF MUNICIPAL SERVICES. SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY THREE LAUGH GOES LOCAL AGENCY FORMATION COMMISSIONS HAVE OPERATED IN ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR MEETING IMPORTANT STATUTORY DIRECTIVES TO TO MAINTAIN ORDERLY BOUNDARIES AND SEEK GREATER EFFICIENCIES AND THE DELIVERY OF LOCAL SERVICES. AB TWELVE FIFTY THREE WOULD ESTABLISH A FIVE YEAR PILOT PROGRAM. TO PROVIDE GRANT FUNDING TO LAUGH GOES AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THE COMMUNITIES TO SIGNIFICANTLY LACK THE FINANCIAL ABILITY TO FINANCE IMPORTANT LAUGHTER ACTIVITIES. AND MEET OR ACCOMPLISH STATUTORY DIRECTIVES. NOT HAVING MYSELF BEEN A MEMBER OF LAUGH GO FOR NUMBER OF YEARS DURING MY TIME AS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR. I CAN SHARE WITH YOU MY EXPERIENCES OF THE CHALLENGES WE ENCOUNTERED AS A LAUGH GO FROM A SMALLER COUNTY. OR ON A DISTRICT. ARE FUNDING LIMITATIONS A CONSTRAINT ABSOLUTELY IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO INITIATE PLANS TO CONSIDER STUDIES IN OPTIONS -- TO CREATE LOCAL EFFICIENCIES AND ULTIMATELY ELIMINATE WASTE. SO AS DETAILED IN THE ANALYSIS THE GRANT PROGRAM ESTABLISHED -- THROUGH THIS BILL WOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL -- AND THE RESPONSIBILITIES WOULD INCLUDE ADOPTING PROGRAM GUIDELINES TIMELINES APPLICATION AND REPORTING CRITERIA FOR PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION -- SO WITH ME. HERE THIS AFTERNOON IS SANTA CRUZ COUNTY SUPERVISOR IN CURRENT LAUGH GO COMMISSIONER JOHN LEOPOLD. AND ALSO WITH THIS IS PAMELA MILLER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL AGENCY FORMATION COMMISSION. THANK YOU MANAGER WELCOME. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- PAMELA MILLER WITH CAL ASCO I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. SO THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS ALL TOO WELL -- GIVEN THE LARGE NUMBER OF LAUGHTER BILLS THAT YOU SEEN OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS -- THAT LAUGH COAST ARE UNDER GROWING CRITICISM. FOR NOT INITIATING ACTION TO CREATE GREATER EFFICIENCIES OR ADDRESSING EXISTING ISSUES IN THE DELIVERY OF LOCAL SERVICES. SO WHILE THERE IS ACTION BY LAUGH BECAUSE IN BY DISTRICTS -- EVIDENCE SHOWS MORE CAN BE DONE. THIS BILL WAS BEFORE YOU LAST YEAR BUT IT LOOKED A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT -- WE TOOK AMENDMENTS FROM THIS COMMITTEE WE TOOK AMENDMENTS IN SENATE GOV IN FINANCE AS WELL AS NATURAL RESOURCES AND WATER. AND NEGOTIATED A COMPROMISE ON THE PROTEST THRESHOLDS WITH CSTA THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION. TO WHAT YOU SEE IN THE BILL TODAY. AND AS A RESULT LAST YEAR THEY MOVED FROM -- OPPOSED TO SUPPORT. THE BILL MADE IT ALL THE WAY TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK LAST YEAR BUT UNFORTUNATELY WAS VETOED. BUT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT RESOURCE FOR LEFT COAST SO WE ARE ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT ONCE AGAIN. AND I WANT TO SHARE JUST FOR A MOMENT THE REALITY OF LIFE BECAUSE IT AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER REAVIS HAS ALREADY. SHARED WITH YOU HIS EXPERIENCE AND SUPERVISOR LEOPOLD WILL SHARE HIS IN SANTA CRUZ. THE BILL ANALYSIS SITE SOME LASKO BUDGET DATA -- AND THE REALITY IS WHEN YOU'RE LASKO HAS AN ANNUAL BUDGET OF UNDERTWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH WHY DO. IN FACT 30% HAVE LESS THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR BUDGET. AND YOU HAVE AN ANNUAL WORK PLAN TO FOLLOW A TO MEET ALL THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS FOR LASKO IN YOUR SOURCE OF REVENUE IS HIGHLY LIMITED. THERE IS LITTLE TO NO ROOM TO TAKE IN DEPTH LOOK AT AREAS WERE SERVICE EFFICIENCIES CAN BE GAINED. SERVICE EFFICIENCIES THAT WILL ULTIMATELY PROVIDE A STREAM LINED. OF AND COST EFFECTIVE WAY OF DELIVERING QUALITY SERVICES. THERE'S ALSO A LITTLE TO NO FINANCING ROOM TO INITIATE ACTION IS A LAUGH ACOSTA ABSORB ALL OF THE COSTS IN THOSE CASES. AND THESE ARE ISSUES ARE SPECIALLY TRUE AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHICH IS THE FOCUS OF THE BILL. THE BILL ALSO ALLOWS LAUGH KERN ISSUED ACTIONS ONLY DURING THIS FIVE YEAR PERIOD AND PERTAINING TO THIS PROGRAM. TO HAVE PROTESTS THRESHOLDS THAT REFLECT. PROTEST THAT THAT REFLECT THE ELECTIONS CODE RELATED TO RECALL ELECTIONS WHICH IS A TIERED APPROACH. THE THRESHOLD TO PRESERVE THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO PROTEST ACTION AND TO HAVE THEIR VOICE HEARD. THIS TIERED APPROACH IS MORE PROPORTIONATE TO THE POPULATION AND THE POPULATION OF A REGISTERED VOTERS THAN A FLAT AND THIS CHANGE ONLY APPLIES TO POTENTIAL ACTIONS TAKEN RELATED TO THIS SPECIAL GRANT PROGRAM WHICH IS DESIGNED FOR LAUGH BECAUSE TO ADDRESS KNOWN SERVICE AND GOVERNANCE CONCERNS IDENTIFIED IN A PREVIOUS MUNICIPAL SERVICE REVIEW. AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT -- KNOWN SERVICE ISSUES THE BERWICK THE BILL CLEARLY STATES THAT THERE MUST BE DOCUMENTED SERVICE CONCERNS PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED IN AN MSR. AS A QUALIFICATION TO APPLY FOR THESE GRANT FUNDS THAT MEANS THAT LAUGH BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GO WHY OLD -- THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GO OFF THE DEEP END -- THE THE WITH -- WITH TRYING TO INITIATE ACTION. THIS BILL IS A GOOD STEP IN PROVIDING LEFT BECAUSE THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO DO WITH THE LEGISLATURE HAS ASKED THEM TO DO AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JOHN LEOPOLD A MEMBER OF THE SANTA CRUZ COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ON THE COMMISSION ARE ON THE SANTA CRUZ COUNTY LOCAL AGENCY FORMATION COMMISSION. AND I'M PAST CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LAUGH GOES THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO LISTEN TO MY TESTIMONY AND FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF AB. TWELVE FIFTY THREE I ALSO WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER REVERSE FOR AUTHORING THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION. OVER MY TEN YEARS ON OUR COUNTIES LAUGHTER WE HAVE DONE A NUMBER OF MUNICIPAL SERVICE REVIEWS ARE MS OURS THAT APPOINTED TO AREAS WHERE SERVICE PROVIDERS COULD GAIN EFFICIENCIES AND SERVICE. ABOUT A DOZEN YEARS AGO WE USED ALL OF OUR SPECIAL STUDIES FUNDS TO LOOK AT FIRE DISTRICTS COUNTY WIDE AT A COST OF ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. OUR STUDY POINTED TO AREAS WERE CONSOLIDATION OF SERVICES OR MERGERS MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO IMPROVE THE FINANCIAL PICTURE A LONG TERM VIABILITY OF SERVICES. WE HELD HEARINGS -- WHEN PRESENTED TO EVERY FIRE DISTRICT AND FOUND THAT NONE OF THE FIRE DISTRICTS EVEN WHEN PRESENTED WITH THIS INFORMATION WERE INTERESTED IN MAKING THE ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES TO THEIR DISTRICT? IN OUR LAST ROUND OF MSR AS WE DID NOT INTEND TO DO A DETAILED STUDY OF EACH FIRE DISTRICT GIVEN THE RESPONSE OF THE PREVIOUS ROUTE PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED. BUT UNLIKE BEFORE ONE OF THE DISTRICT TOLD US THEY WERE READY TO SERIOUSLY LOOK AT THIS ISSUES. THE DISTRICT CONTAINS A SIZEABLE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY AND COUNTS ON THE FIRE DISTRICT FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT. WE REACHED OUT TO THE NEIGHBORING FIRE DISTRICT AND FOUND INTEREST THERE AS WELL. AT LEAST ONE BOARD WAS READY TO GO AND BOTH FIRE JESTER COULD JUST LIKE OTHER FIRE CHIEFS PRESENTING A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO CLEAR THE HURDLES THAT USUALLY STAND IN THE WAY. OF THESE DISCUSSIONS WE HAD GOOD INTEREST BUT LOW FUNDS TO CONDUCT A STUDY THAT CAN LEAD TO BETTER SERVICES AND FINANCIAL STABILITY FOR THESE FIRE DISTRICTS. THE REASON THAT THE FIRE DISTRICT WERE INTERESTED WAS DUE TO THE INCREASING COSTS IN OPERATION OUR LOCAL LASKO HOWEVER HAD SPENT MOST OF OUR SPECIAL STUDY REVENUE. ON ARE LOOKING AT PARKS AND SANITATION DISTRICT WHICH IS ALSO OUR RESPONSIBILITIES SO WE FACED A CROSSROADS. IF WE HAD A GRANT PROGRAM LIKE THE ONE ENVISIONED IN AB TWELVE FIFTY THREE THE CHOICE WOULD HAVE BEEN CLEAR. THROUGH A SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION WE COULD STUDY THE ISSUES OF INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICE DELIVERY SALARY AND BENEFITS PARITY A LONG TERM PERSONAL BENEFITS. A STUDY LIKE THIS WOULD COST ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WOULD TAX THE BUDGET OF ALL THE THREE AGENCIES -- IF WE HAD TO DO IT OURSELVES. OF THE TOP REASON THAT LAUGH BECAUSE DO NOT INITIATE ACTIONS TO IMPROVE SERVICES IS THE LACK OF LACK OF FUNDING ALWAYS FEATURED PROMINENTLY. AS MUCH. AS PAMELA MENTIONED THE 47% OF OUR LAUGH GOES HAVE AN ANNUAL BUDGET. OF UNDER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR SO YOU CAN SEE THE FINANCIAL IMPACT FOR THESE KIND OF STUDIES. WHAT HAVE OUR LOCAL LAUGH GOES? THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION RARELY RECOMMENDS FUNDING TO SOLVE PROBLEMS BUT FORTUNATELY SAW THAT A SMALL ONE TIME INFUSION OF OF FUNDS -- FOR THIS GRANT PROGRAM COULD POTENTIALLY SAVE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS ADDITIONAL MONEY IF IT LEADS TO STREAMLINE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND IMPROVED EFFICIENCY AND SERVICE DELIVERY. OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAS SOMETIMES. BEEN FRUSTRATED WITH THE SLOW AND DELIBERATIVE LAUGH GO PROCESSES AND INTRODUCED BILLS THAT WOULD TAKE AWAY LOCAL ANALYSIS OF ISSUES SUCH AS THE CONSOLIDATION OF SPECIAL DISTRICTS. TODAY I ASK YOUR SUPPORT FOR AB TWELVE FIFTY THREE TO PROVIDE THE ONLY FUNDING WE WOULD GET FROM THE STATE TO CONDUCT OUR STATE MANDATED RESPONSIBILITIES AND HELP US CONDUCT THESE STUDIES AND IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY IS A SPECIAL DISTRICT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THROUGH THIS LEGISLATION WE CAN KEEP THE DECISION MADE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THAT IS THE BEST PLACE TO RESOLVE COMPLICATED ISSUES OF MERGERS AND CONSOLIDATION. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST -- I BUILT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY ARE THERE ANY OTHER. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THAT HEAD ON COLLISION. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS ANTHONY TAMIL WITH CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION. IN SUPPORT OUT ONE I THINK THE WHOLE LAUGHTER TEAM WORKING WITH US LAST YEAR SO HERE ON AROUND TOO WE CAN INTO THE ASTOR KLAY SAY SUPPORT. THANK YOU. DO A KERRY FULLY CALIFORNIA'S RESULTS IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ELIZABETH ESPINOSA HERE ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. JOHN KENNEDY ON BEHALF OF THE RURAL COUNTIES ALSO IN SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU. Q. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT SEEING NONE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR WELL ENOUGH MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CHRIS ANDERSON I'M ON BEHALF OF ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES -- I WANNA PREFACE MY COMMENTS BY SAYING THAT WERE NOT A PART WE HAVE A POSITION OF NOT OPPOSE PROPOSED UNLESS AMENDED -- BUT OUR BUT I DOES NOT CONCERN ESTABLISHING THE GRANT PROGRAM RATHER OUR OPPOSITION. IT ADDRESSES THE PROTEST THRESHOLD IN THE BILL UNDER EXISTING LAW WHEN I LAUGHED -- INITIATES AN ORGANIZATION A REORGANIZATION -- A THAT THAT ORGANIZATION THAT ACTION. USE THE MICROPHONE YES. SORRY ABOUT THAT [inaudible] THAT ACTION. MUST BE SUBMITTED TO THE VOTERS IF. AT LEAST 10 OF REGISTERED VOTERS. PROTEST THE PROPOSED ACTION THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A DUPLICATE OF PROTEST THRESHOLD -- A TIERED PROTEST THRESHOLD THAT WOULD FOR THE EXACT SAME LASKO INITIATED ACTION SO OUR BELIEF IS THAT THIS WOULD CONFUSE EXISTING LAW AND ALSO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT -- FOR AFFECTED REGISTERED VOTERS IN AFFECTED TERRITORIES. TO PROTEST. LASKO INITIATED ACTION. IN ADDITION WE'RE LOOKING FOR TWO ADDITIONAL WE'RE LOOKING FOR TO AMENDMENTS. ONE WOULD BE TO EXEMPT PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES FROM THIS BILL THAT WOULD THAT THEORY IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS GIVEN THE STATE WATER BOARD. THE ABILITY TO CONSOLIDATE AND EXTEND SERVICE TO AREAS THAT. ARE CURRENTLY IS SERVED BY AGENCIES THAT FAILED TO PROVIDE SAFE DRINKING WATER AND THE OTHER AND THEN AT THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS A PUBLIC STAKEHOLDER PROCESS WHEN CAL LASKO AND MEN AND AT THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL. DISCUSS THE GUIDELINES AND CRITERIA FOR THIS -- APPLICATION. AND I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- HIS STAFF -- AND CAL LASKO FOR CONTINUING TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH US ABOUT THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU. DENNIS ALBION AB HALF OF MESA WATER COSTA MESA CALIFORNIA WE ASSOCIATE OUR COMMENTS HE DID A EXCELLENT JOB CHRIS DID FROM AQUA. AND LOCALLY IT IS AN ORANGE COUNTY THERE ARE. FOLKS THAT DO TO VIEW SOMETIMES VIEW -- GOVERNMENT A LITTLE SKEPTICAL AND THE ISSUE WITH THE DIFFERENT THRESHOLDS. WE THINK IT FRANKLY DOESN'T NECESSARILY MAKE SENSE TO HAVE THE TIERED THRESHOLDS I KEEP IT ONE STANDARD -- YOU KNOW THE KNOX CORTESE HERTZBERG ACTING WHEN THE HERTZBERG WAS ADDED TO IN. TWO THOUSAND THIS WAS A WELL NEGOTIATED. OF THRESHOLD THAT WAS WITH THAT WAS APPROVED AND WE THINK IT'S BEST TO MAINTAIN THE EXISTING THRESHOLD. AND GO FROM THERE I THINK WILL HELP. AS FOLKS AS PUBLIC FUNDS ARE USED FOR THESE GRANTS TO TO DO THESE IN ADDRESS AN ACTIVE -- ENTITIES AS WELL AS OTHER -- CONSOLIDATIONS THAT IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A BIG YOU KNOW POWER GRAB WITH SOME PUBLIC FUNDS AND SO I THINK AND AGAIN NOT THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. JUST THAT'S THE PERCEPTION OF SOMETIMES SO IT IS ESPECIALLY IN. CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE. SO WE THINK THE THRESHOLD TO SAY THE SAME AND THEN WILL BE THE THE STANDARDIZED VIEW THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE OTHER IN QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. YES. ASSEMBLYMEMBER VOEPEL SO. THE CORE POINTS OF THIS. THE BILL MAKES SENSE TO ME AND I SUPPORT [inaudible] BUT THE PROTEST THRESHOLDS. HI I WOULD LIKE TO ASK -- THE LEFT CO PEOPLE. WHY NOT LEAVE IT A 10% BY MONKEY WITH IT MAKE IT TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY OR WHATEVER -- I DON'T GET THAT PART OF IT. THROUGH THE CHAIR IF I MAY. UM SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL. THE THE SO SUPERVISOR LEOPOLD HAD MENTIONED A FUNDING WAS ONE OF THE MAJOR DETERRENCE FOR LAUGH CO TO INITIATE ACTION. BECAUSE WHEN LAUGH BECAUSE INITIATE THE ACTION THEY AND IN ESSENCE BECOME THE APPLICANTS AND THEY HAVE TO PAY ALL OF THOSE FEES. ANOTHER MAJOR DETERRENT. OF FOR LAUGH CLOSE TO INITIATE ACTION IS THE DESPAIR AT PROTESTS THRESHOLD -- AND IF I COULD -- RESPOND TO ONE OF THE OPPONENTS COMMENTS ABOUT THE WELL NEGOTIATED A 10% VERSUS 25% THERE IS A A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY ABOUT WHY THEY ARE THE WAY THEY ARE. AND SO THERE 25% WAS PUT IN PLACE MANY MANY. YEARS AGO FOR NON LAUGH CONUS SHADED ACTIONS. IT WAS BACK IN I BELIEVE NINETEEN NINETY THREE WHEN LAUGH COAST ACTUALLY WERE GIVEN THE AUTHORITY TO INITIATE ACTION IT WAS THROUGH ASSEMBLY MEMBER GOTCH OF RAN A BILL. AND THE ORIGINAL BILL HAD 25% AS THE THRESHOLD SO IT MIRRORED EXISTING STATUTE. COME. UP AS WE KNOW HOW THINGS GO WHEN -- WHEN THEY GO THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE? THAT WAS NEGOTIATED DOWN 210%. AN ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS WERE PLACED ON LAUGH KOS IN ORDER FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY INITIATE ACTION THAT DON'T EXIST FOR NON LAUGHED WHEN SHE DID ACTION. AT THAT AT THAT POINT IT WAS NEGOTIATED DOWN A BECAUSE FOLKS WERE AFRAID AGAIN THAT LAUGH BECAUSE WE'RE JUST GOING TO GO WILD WITH. INITIATING ACTIONS AND THE REALITY IS THAT -- COOK NOTHING COULD BE FARTHER FROM THE TRUTH I MEAN THERE PROCESSES IS DELIBERATE IT'S BEEN CREATED THAT WAY BY THE LEGISLATURE -- AND OUT SO -- WHEN THE WHEN THE? THE OF LEVEL IS 10% OF IT IT IS A HUGE DETERRENT. AND SO -- WHAT? OR WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING IS FOR PURPOSES OF THIS GRANT PROGRAMS THAT IT BE TIERED AND SO FOR EXAMPLE IF. IF WE USE THE ELECTION CODE THAT IS BEING USED IF YOU HAVE A HUNDRED A HUNDRED THOUSAND REGISTERED VOTERS. I WANNA MAKE SURE I'M I'M GETTING THIS A 100% ACCURATE I HAVE HERE WITH ME. SO IF. IF THE REGISTER EFFORT IF THERE'S LESS THAN A THOUSAND REGISTERED VOTERS THE THRESHOLD WOULD BE 30% AND IT IT IT TEARS FROM THERE. AND IF THERE'S A HUNDRED THOUSAND OR MORE REGISTERED VOTERS THAN THE LEVEL IS 10% SO CLEARLY THE LARGER THE COMMUNITY THE LARGER THE PROTESTS THRESHOLD IS [inaudible] MAY I SO YOU SAID IT WAS A DETERRENT. A DETERRENT TO WHO. SO -- IF FOR THE LAUGH CO TO INITIATE ACTION. ALL I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE -- ONE OF ONE EXAMPLE IS -- IN ONE OF THE A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES THE LAUGHTER WAS LOOKING AT A NUMBER OF A FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICTS. OF FOR CONSOLIDATION AND THEY HAD DONE A MUNICIPAL SERVICE REVIEW AND THEY HAD ALL THE THE BACKUP MATERIAL. AND THEY WERE CONSIDERING -- INITIATING A CONSOLIDATION OF THESE FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICTS. THERE THEY WERE VERY VERY SMALL AND SO THE THRESHOLD -- TO ANISH TO TRIGGER AN ELECTION WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE HUNDRED SIGNATURES OR PROTESTS -- ANNA TO REACH THE SO THE LEFT -- REALIZED THAT -- THAT WITH THIS SUCH A SMALL COMMUNITY THEY KNEW THAT. IT. IT WOULD FAIL. AND O THE LAUGH CO IS THE ONE THAT INITIATES THE ACTION THEY PUT ALL OF THEIR OWN RESOURCES NOBODY FUNDS IT IT COMES OUT OF THIS SMALL LAUGH CHO BUDGET. TO PROCESS THE APPLICATION TO TO DO THE ELECTION ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND SO -- WE'RE SIMPLY ASKING FOR A LITTLE A LITTLE LENIENCY THEIR IF I COULD MAKE ONE MORE COMMENT ABOUT THE PROTEST. THIS LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION REPORT THAT WE'VE ALL A YOU KNOW HEARD ABOUT -- THAT WE WE'VE LIVED FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS NOW -- THEY MADE A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO LAUGH CO AND ONE OF THEM WAS REGARDING. THE PROTEST THRESHOLDS -- WE HAVE GATHERED A GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS AND WE ARE FORMING RIGHT NOW. A WORKING GROUP OF TO TAKE A AT LEAST A TWO YEAR LOOK. AT THE UP AT THE CURRENT PROTEST PROCESS SEES AND THE THRESHOLDS BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE A VERY CONVOLUTED. UP -- BUT WE FEEL THAT -- THAT IS OF SEPARATE AND APART THAT THE THAT THIS ACTION THIS GRANT PROGRAM THIS FUNDING -- AT AND WHAT'S CONTAINED IN THE PROGRAM IS SEPARATE FROM. THAT FULL REVIEW. I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION MADAM CHAIR I HAVE NO OTHER QUESTIONS MAY I MAKE A CLOSING STATEMENT. SURE THANK YOU. SOAP HERE'S WHAT I HAVE TROUBLE WITH GOING TO THE TIERED -- TWENTY FIVE OR 30% EXCEPT -- OVER 10%. LEFT GO MAY HAVE A TIGHT BUDGET I I GET THAT. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER REVERSE I UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM AND I SUPPORT ALMOST I SUPPORTED ALL ALL EXCEPT FOR THE 10% HERE'S WHY. YOU HAVE A TIGHT BUDGET. OKAY [inaudible] CITIZENS. THAT ARE PROTESTING A CHANGE TO THEIR LITTLE WORLDS OR THEIR BIG WORLD'S DEPENDING UPON. THE POPULATION LEVEL. THEY SHOULD HAVE. THE ABILITY TO PROTEST AT THE THEY DON'T. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO ORGANIZE A CITIZEN PROTEST WITHOUT MONEY UNLESS THERE'S SOME OUTSIDE MONEY. SO YOU HAVE A TREMENDOUS ADVANTAGE TO ME -- THE 10% LEVEL IS FAIR. THEY HAVE A CHANCE. AND I WAS MAYOR OF A CITY FOR SIXTEEN YEARS. AND WE DID A LOT OF BUSINESS WITH LAUGH CO AND ON A FEW OCCASIONS THE CITIZENS REVOLTED. AND LOST ONE OUT OF TWO OKAY THAT I RECOLLECT. SO THE POINT I'M MAKING IS. GREAT BILL EVERYTHING BUT CHANGING THE 10% IS THERE ANY WAY THERE COULD BE AN AMENDMENT ON THAT. ONE AND I'M DONE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SO I'M IN A SO MANY ENTERTAIN A MOTION. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I DO APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS YOU KNOW I DO APPRECIATE -- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN. YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THE THE TIERED APPROACH FOR TRACK THE FOR FOR THE PROTEST YOU KNOW THE THAT THAT THRESHOLD WE BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW IT IS A LOGICAL ONE THEY STILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROTEST -- BUT CERTAINLY WE CAN YOU KNOW EXPLORE YOU KNOW -- THE OPTION BUT CERTAINLY. YOU KNOW THIS IS A BILL THAT ADDRESSES A NEED YOUR GOAL LONG WAY IN THE TO SUPPORT SMALLER LAP GO DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- IT AGAIN FROM MY EXPERIENCE AS A LAUGH GO COMMISSIONER FROM A SMALL COUNTY YEAH I KNOW FROM FIRST HAND -- THAT LAUGH GOES ACROSS THE STATE AND SMALLER DISTRICTS ESPECIALLY THOSE SERVING DISADVANTAGED -- THE COMMUNITIES LACK THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO MAKE CHANGES CHANGES NECESSARY TO ENHANCE SERVICES THE DELIVERY CREATE EFFICIENCIES -- THE MANAGER THANK YOU -- AND I RESPECTFULLY URGE AND I ABOUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I WORK WITH LIFE GOES FOR QUITE SOME TIME AS WELL. THE MY FRUSTRATION WAS ALWAYS THE LACK OF FUNDING FOR YOU TO MOVE THINGS ALONG. AND SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY -- I APPRECIATE IT'S TAKEN A LONG TIME FOR THESE CONVERSATIONS OF THE TWO TIER THING I APPRECIATE MR VOEPEL AS A COMMENTS AS WELL. BUT WE NEED TO GET SOME FUNDING SO WE CAN GET THESE THINGS YOUR WE ARE PROJECTS MOVING IN SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THAT FORD. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TRIP ALL THE WAY UP FROM SANTA CRUZ TO TESTIFY THE TODAY WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT. I'M WITHOUT DIXIE YOU US USING. SECRETARY CREE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND WE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS AGUIAR-CURRY. AGUIAR-CURRY I LACKEY LACKEY NO BLOOM. BLOOM I'D CHIU RAMOS. RAMOS SIDE A THREE OF US. THREE OF US SIDE ROBERT RIVAS. ROBERTRIVERSIDE VOEPEL RESPECT VOEPEL NO. MEASURES THAT FIVE TO TWO THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] THANK. NUMBER [inaudible] ONE SEVEN YEAH SHARE. YEAH HE'S BACK. ITEM NUMBER SIX A CA. ONE SHARE AGUIAR-CURRY THANK YOU -- THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS ACA ONE WILL LOWER THE NECESSARY VOTER THRESHOLD FROM TWO THIRDS. TO A 55% SUPERMAJORITY TO PROVE LOCAL GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS AND SPECIAL TAXES WHEN PROPOSED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SUPPORTABLE HOUSE SUPPORT OF HOUSING AND PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. THIS IS A VOTE THRESHOLD THAT WE HAVE ALREADY APPROVED FOR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ISSUE SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION BONDS. THIS MEASURE GIVES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS A MORE REALISTIC FINANCING OPTION TO FUND AN INCREASE IN THE SUPPLY OF HOUSING. AND TO ADDRESS THE NUMEROUS LOCAL PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES CITIES COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS ARE FACING EACH DAY. IN THIS COMMITTEE. WE ARE WELL AWARE OF THE MANY MANY EXAMPLES STATEWIDE WHERE BUILDINGS ARE FALLING APART. ROADS ARE IN NEED OF REPAIR. LIBRARIES AND PARKS ARE SCARCE AND THE NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING HAS REACHED A STAGGERING LEVEL. ACA ONE IS A TOOL FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT PROJECTS TO PRIORITIZE. TO BE CLEAR. NOTHING IN THIS BILL INCREASES TAXES. NOTHING IN THIS BILL REQUIRES A JURISDICTION TO PROPOSE A MEASURE TO ITS VOTERS. WHAT THIS BILL DOES DO IS PROVIDE A TOOL FOR OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS TO HELP THEM DECIDE HOW TO BESTSERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES? WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO PASS IT OFF TO MY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT FROM HOUSING CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS TYRONE BUCKLEY WITH HOUSING CALIFORNIA PLEASE -- TO SUPPORT THIS IMPORTANT BILL -- WE ALL KNOW THAT OUR STATE IS MIRED IN A HOUSING CRISIS ONE KEY SOLUTION IS TO BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE HOMES. AN ACA ONE HELPS US KNOCKED DOWN ONE OF THE MANY BARRIERS THAT OUR STATE MUST REMOVE TO MAKE AFFORDABLE HOUSING EASIER TO BUILD SO THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF RACE INCOME AGE. CONTINUE TO CALL OUR STATE HOME. HOUSING PRICES. ARE DRIVING THE COSTS OUT OF REACH FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS AS A RESULT ONE IN THREE HOUSEHOLDS CANNOT MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS. WE ALL KNOW ACCORDING TO LATEST REPORTS THAT DESPITE PASSAGE OF RECENT WAS LEGISLATION AND BONDS IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN HOUSING PACKAGE AND BY THE VOTER STATE FUNDING TODAY REMAINS WELL BELOW. THE TWENTY TWO THOUSAND TWELVE LEVELS UNDERMINING PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING THIS CRISIS. ACA ONE PROVIDES A GREATER OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMUNITIES THAT WISH TO PUT. THEIR OWN SKIN IN THE GAME AND DO THEIR PART TO ADDRESS THE STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS. BY REDUCING THE VOTER THRESHOLD. ADDITIONALLY THE VOTE AND AND AND THE MEMBER MENTIONED THIS. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE VOTE THRESHOLD AN ACA ONE WOULD PUT LOCAL HOUSING BONDS ON THE SAME LEVEL AS LOCAL SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION -- WHICH ALSO REQUIRES 55% IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE STATE SOUGHT VOTER APPROVAL FOR RECENT HOUSING AND PARKS ONES AT THE STATE LEVEL -- SOMETHING THAT HOUSING CALIFORNIA HELP CHAMPION IN THE VOTE REQUIREMENT WAS JUST A SIMPLE MAJORITY. I HAVE HEARD PERSONALLY FROM LEADERSACROSS THE STATE IN PLACES LIKE SANTA CRUZ SACRAMENTO WEST SACRAMENTO. THAT REDUCING THE THRESHOLD 55% WOULD ALLOW THEM TO RAISE INVESTMENT THEY NEED TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. WE'RE PLEASED TO SUPPORT THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION OUR MEMBERSHIP IS IN STRONG SUPPORT AND SEES IT AS A KEY TOOL TO SOLVING THE HOUSING CRISIS. AND WE ARE DRIVERS. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHRISTY BOMB ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. POLICE TO BE CO SPONSORS OF THIS MEASURE. A YOU KNOW OUR MEMBERS RESPOND ALL KINDS OF DISASTERS -- IN THE RESPONDING OUT OF FIRE WHO HOUSES WHO THAT ARE DECADES OLD MAYBE WE GET A NEW FIRE HOUSE WHEN THERE'S A BRAND NEW DEVELOPMENT BUT OTHER FIRE HOUSES HAVE BEEN AROUND. FOR DECADES AND DECADES THAT NEED RETROFITTING AND ATTENTION. OF IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THESE FIREFIGHTERS I THINK THE IMPORTANT POINT OF THIS MEASURE IS. THIS IS A QUESTION TO BE PUT TO THE VOTERS THAT'S ALL WE'RE ASKING TO DO IS. TO ASK THE VOTERS WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT A VOTE THRESHOLD CHANGE FROM TWO THIRDS 255%. BUT YOU'RE NOT RAISING ATTACKS TODAY IN THIS VOTE YOU'RE SUPPORTING YOUR COMMUNITIES TO GO TO THEIR VOTERS. THE PREVIOUS WITNESS SAID AND HAVE A CONVERSATION WHAT MAKES SENSE FOR THEIR COMMUNITY. WHAT SHOULD DETERMINE? WHEN YOU LEVY A TAX IN A COMMUNITY OR ISSUE BONDED INDEBTEDNESS SO WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT TODAY? THANK YOU ARE THERE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. IT LOOKS LIKE THE RIGHT. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE BAKER WITH THEIR NATIVE SAYS HIS FOR THE PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS IN CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT.

MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS HAULING MICHON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD IN THE CITY OF GOLD LEADER IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLACE. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THAT GOOD AFTERNOON DAVID WOLF WITH THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION DAY CA. ONE MEMBERS LET ME JUST START AND REALLY JUST MAKE IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR. A VOTE FREE CA ONE WILL MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO OWN PROPERTY IT'LL MAKE IT MORE EXPENSIVE FOR PEOPLE TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES. AND IT WILL DIRECTLY HARM LOW INCOME PEOPLE TO THE POTENTIAL AUTHORIZATION OF HIGHER REGRESSIVE SALES TAXES -- THIS IS A MIDDLE CLASS TAX INCREASE OR AUTHORIZATION THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO SOLVE CALIFORNIA'S RECORD HIGH 20% POVERTY RATE. THERE'S BEEN NUMEROUS PPIS PP I SEE POLLS DONE WITHIN THE LAST YEAR FIRST OF ALL 62% OF INDIVIDUALS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CONTINUOUS SUPPORT PROP. THIRTEEN THERE IS MAJORITY SUPPORT IN EVERY SINGLE GEOGRAPHIC AREA OF CALIFORNIA FOR MAINTAINING THE TWO THIRDS VOTE FOR PERSONAL TAXES. AND MEMBERS WITH GOOD REASON PERSONAL TAXES ARE VERY AGGRESSIVE IN THAT IT'S THE SAME FLAT RATE AMOUNT THAT IMPACTS EVERY SINGLE PROPERTY OWNER IN THIS STATE. DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR INCOME IT DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR HOW SITES. OKAY EXTREMELY REGRESSIVE TAX AND I THINK THAT REALLY SPEAKS TO WHY THE TWO THIRDS VOTE IS SO IMPORTANT. IN A QUOTE THAT'S OFTEN ATTRIBUTED TO BENJAMIN FRANKLIN YOU WAS FOND OF SAYING DEMOCRACY IS TWO WOLVES AND A SHEEP. DECIDING WHAT'S FOR DINNER. IN THAT INSTANCE EVERYONE -- KNOW WHAT WHAT'S MEANT BY THAT QUOTE RIGHT EVERYBODY VOTES BUT ONLY PROPERTY OWNERS PAY. THERE WAS A COMMENT THAT WAS MADE AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE ON A CA ONE TODAY -- REGARDING PROP THIRTEEN PROTECTING A VOCAL MINORITY. AND MEMBERS THERE'S ONLY ABOUT THAT ACTUALLY OWNS THEIR OWN HOMES. AND I'M ONE OF THEM WE ARE BASICALLY A MINORITY. IN OTHER WORDS WE'RE THE SHEEP THAT DON'T WANT TO GET EATEN BY THE WOLVES POTENTIALLY ADDING HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS TO PROPERTY TAX BILLS. TO HIGHER PERSONAL TAX. NEXT POINT THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF BONDS OR PERSONAL TAXES THE CAN BE PASSED BY CITIES AND COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS. AGAIN THE QUESTION NEEDS REPOSE HOW DO HIGHER BONDS AND PERSONAL TAXES EXCLUSIVELY AGAINST PROPERTY OWNERS PROMOTE HOMEOWNERSHIP. AND THE ANSWER IS VERY SIMPLE THEY DO NOT. ALSO WE NEED TO QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT LOWERING THE THRESHOLD IS EVEN NECESSARY THERE HAVE BEEN LITERALLY DOZENS OF TWO THIRDS VOTE BONDS AND SPECIAL TAXES THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. IN THE STATE SINCE. TWO THOUSAND TEN WHAT IS IN GENERAL ORANGE COUNTY OF ALL PLACES PAST YOU TRANSPORTATION SALES TAXES OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. WHEN YOU IF YOU LOOK BACK OVER THE LAST THREE NOVEMBER ELECTIONS THESE MEASURES BONDS AND SALES TAXES AND PERSONAL TAXES HAVE OVER A 50% TAX RATE? PASS RATE SO IS IT DIFFICULT TO PASS THESE MEASURES OF COURSE IS IT IS IT IMPOSSIBLE ABSOLUTELY NOT. THESE CAN AND YOU PASS WITH A TWO THIRDS VOTE. SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED CALIFORNIA IS TWENTY FIRST AND COMBINED STATE AND LOCAL PER CAPITA PROPERTY TAXES ACCORDING TO THE TAX FOUNDATION EVEN WITH PROPOSITION. THIRTEEN OKAY WE WE ARE VERY HIGH PROPERTY TAX STATE AND THAT'S PRECISELY BECAUSE OF THESE LOCAL BONDS IN PERSONAL TAXES BEING APPROVED BY VOTERS AND WHY WOULD HE MAKE THAT PROCESS EASIER. AND MEMBERS FINALLY IN CLOSING -- THE ARGUMENTS BEEN NAY HEY WE SHOULD JUST LET THE VOTERS DECIDE WHY CAN'T WE JUST LET THE VOTERS DECIDE AND PUT IT ON THE BALLOT. AND THE FACT REMAINS THAT TWICE IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS VOTERS HAVE DECIDED MOST RECENTLY IN TWO THOUSAND SIX PROPOSITION EIGHTY EIGHT WAS ON THE BALLOT BACK THEN. THAT WAS A FIFTY DOLLAR PERSONAL TAX INCREASE ON PRETTY MUCH ALL PROPERTIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THAT WAS REJECTED WITH US REJECTED SEVENTY FIVE TO TWENTY FIVE SO I THINK THE VOTERS HAVE SPOKEN VERY VERY CARLY BOTH RECENTLY AND AGAIN THROUGH THE PPA SEE POLLS THAT THEY DON'T WANT THIS THRESHOLD WORRIED SO FOR ALL THOSE REASONS ASPIRIN OVER. OKAY FAHRRAD REPRESENTING COALITION PRODUCT WITH SCHOOL HOUSING. I IN OUR LETTER WE WERE CLEAR -- WE WERE NOT ASKING FOR NOVELL TODAY WERE IN THE PROPOSAL AS AMENDED. AND THAT IS BECAUSE WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR. AND OUR STAFF. WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. FROM A SCHOOL POINT OF VIEW. HI. WE ARE. WANTING TO BE SURE ON THE PROVISIONS THAT THERE'S A UNDERSTANDING THAT UNDER TO SCHOOL 55%. WE HAVE A CAP ON THE AMOUNT OF DEBT WE CAN ISSUE -- WE ALSO ARE CAPPED ON OUR TAX RATE. SO YOU WANT TO SEE IF WE CAN HAVE THOSE TYPES OF DISCUSSIONS. NOT IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. BECAUSE THAT'D BE TOO RESTRICTIVE AND CONSTRAINING. BUT IN SEPARATE STATUTE. I WOULD SAY IF THE AMENDMENT PASSES. THAN SIMILAR TYPES OF PROVISIONS. WOULD BE APPLICABLE. OF FOR THIS 55% HAS ARE APPLICABLE TO THE SCHOOL 55%. SO WE HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE HAVE CONVERSATIONS WE CAN CONTINUE TO DISCUSS THESE ISSUES AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR TREES TO MAY REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE TEND TO THIS BILL WE RESPECTFULLY MUST SUPPOSE WE HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL. NUMBER ONE IS THAT THIS BILL COULD POTENTIALLY HARM THOSE THAT IT INTENDS TO HELP. BY FACILITATING TAX INCREASES ON BOTH SALES AND PARCEL TAXES. IT COULD POTENTIALLY INCREASE THE COST OF HOUSING CONSTRUCTION. SECONDARILY IT IMPOSES A TAX ON THOSE WORKING FAMILIES THAT IT THIS IS INTENDED TO HELP. THE GOVERNOR AND HIS STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS WANTED TO MAKE CALIFORNIA AFFORDABLE FOR ALL. AND WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THERE MAY BE INADVERTENT CONSEQUENCES AS A RESULT OF FACILITATING TAX INCREASES. ON WORKING FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR COMMENTS -- AND I I WANT TO BE EVEN HANDED HERE SO -- I ASKED -- FOR BRIEF COMMENTS -- FROM -- A PROPONENTS ANALYST FOR THE SAME FROM OPPONENTS. THANK YOU. KAREN KLINGER LOCAL REAL ESTATE BROKER I SEE THIS BILL AS NOTHING BUT DISCRIMINATION. AGAINST HOMEOWNERS WHO HAVE PAID CONSTANTLY FOR ADDED TAXES I'VE HANDED THE GENTLEMAN TWO PAGES OF TAXES THIS IS A DISCRIMINATION AGAINST YOUNG PEOPLE. WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BUY A HOME BECAUSE CONVERSION HAS PARCEL TAXES WERE ASKING YOU TO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS BRIEF THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THEN IT'S ALL GONNA BE WE HAVE THE FAMILY BUSINESS ASSOCIATES CALIFORNIA WHICH HAS HIT OUR COMMENT. WITH CAL TAX AND THE OTHER FOLKS -- WE WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ONGOING TAXATION OF BUSINESS IS LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. BUT DROUGHT COOK FOR THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WE ARE POST. THANK YOU I DO HAVE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE IS THERE A MOTION. MR TO MAKE THE MOTION AND HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS AND I'M. PLEASED TO BE A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL AS THE CHAIR OF THE HOUSING COMMITTEE I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT -- WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF THE MOST INTENSE HOUSING CRISIS AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. AND LONG TERM WE ALL KNOW THAT OUR STATE FACES A VERY SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE CRISIS. AS WAS RELATED BEFORE WERE NOT VOTING -- TO RAISE ANYONE'S TAXES -- WE'RE SIMPLY ALLOWING FOR LOCAL CONTROL. AND I JUST HAVE TO RELATE -- A PHONE CONVERSATION I HAD WITH THE CONSTITUENT WHO SAID WHY ARE YOU SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE SUPPORTING A 55% VOTER THRESHOLD. AND I SAID -- BECAUSE IS RIGHT THING TO DO AND HE SAID WHY IS IT NOT 50% WHY YOU RAISING. THE TAX THRESHOLD AND I HAD TO EXPLAIN THE HISTORY OF HOW WE GOT HERE -- BUT THE FACT THE MATTER IS MOST MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC BELIEVE IN OUR DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY THAT WE OUGHT TO HAVE A ONE MAJORITY ABILITY TO VOTE THIS INSURES THAT A CLEAR MAJORITY OF OUR COMMUNITY IS ABLE TO SUPPORT MEASURES. AND I WANT TO ALSO JUST TAKE A MOMENT I DO UNDERSTAND AND RESPECT THE PERSPECTIVE OF SOME OF THE BUSINESS TRADE ASSOCIATIONS THAT ARE OPPOSING THIS. I'VE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH BUSINESS LEADERS WHO BELIEVE. THAT OUR ECONOMY IS DEEPLY THREATEN AT THIS TIME BECAUSE OF OUR STATES LACK OF INVESTMENT IN HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SO MANY COMPANIES THAT ARE TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHER. THEY CAN HAVE WORKERS WHO CAN AFFORD TO LIVE NEAR THEIR JOBS WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF WORKERS WERE THINKING OF LEAVING OUR STATE. A BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE HOUSING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR ALL THOSE REASONS HAPPY TO VOTE FOR THIS AND HOPE THAT THIS COMMITTEE WILL BE ABLE TO AS WELL. THANK YOU DID YOU WANT TO ADD COMMENTS SMITH'S REVERSE ALL RIGHT TO ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THEN -- I'LL I'LL JUST AT THAT -- I THINK THIS IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BILL -- TO ALL ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS WITH THE THOSE OF OUR HOUSING CHAIR MISTER CHIU -- AND AND JUST ADD THAT -- IT'S A CRISIS OF WE HAVE. TO MAKE A STATEMENT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE GOING TO TREAT IT AS A PRIORITY IN THIS HOUSE -- AND IF WE WAIT AROUND -- FOR SOMETHING THAT IS A PERFECT VEHICLE THEN NOTHING WILL EVER HAPPEN -- THERE IT I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT TO NOBODY -- TAKES A RAISING FEES OR TAXES LIGHTLY -- BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN WE HAVE TO DO IT AND IF THIS IS NOT THAT TIME -- THEN I DON'T KNOW -- WHAT IS AND AGAIN WERE SIMPLY ALLOWING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBILITY AND GETTING TO THAT PLACE -- NOW -- MISS AGUIAR-CURRY -- I'M SHOCKED BUT THIS BILL ENJOYS DO PASS RECOMMENDED SHARE. A HOME WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YES I WOULD I LIKE TO WHILE ONCE AGAIN REITERATE THAT IN PRACTICE LOCAL OFFICIALS PROPOSE A LOCAL BOND OR SPECIAL TAX AND THEN THE VOTERS OF THAT COMMUNITY DECIDE WHETHER THEY SUPPORT. THE IDEA OR NOT. VOTERS WILL IT WOULD STILL NEED TO OVERWHELMINGLY SUPPORT A MEASURE FOR IT TO BE APPROVED WITH 55% OF THE VOTE. ACA ONE WILL LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD AND CREATE PARITY BETWEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CITIES COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS SO THAT ALL GOVERNMENTS HAVE A VIABLE FINANCING TOOL TO ADDRESS COMMUNITY NEEDS. MEMBERS THE QUESTION IS WHETHER IN OUR STATES DEMOCRACY YOU THINK ONE VOTER SHOULD COUNT HALF AS MUCH AS ANOTHER. I THINK THE TIME HAS COME THAT WE SHOULD SHOW ALL COUNT. ALL COUNT EQUALLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I ASK FOR YOUR IBM. THANK YOU. WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND WE WILL AS THE SECRETARY TO CALL THE ROLL.
