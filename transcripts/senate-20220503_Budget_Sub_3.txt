WITHIN OUTCOMES- WHICH THERE IS A PORTION OF THE REQUEST THAT WOULD BE GOING TO DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES TO- ASSIST IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF OUR STATE HEARING PROCESS- REALLY APPRECIATE STAFF WORK ON ON THE- AGENDA AS DOES A REALLY NICE- JOB IN. WRITING THE PROPOSAL BUT QUICKLY I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT IN. ORDER FOR US TO BEST SUPPORT FAMILY. THROUGHOUT THEIR JOURNEY AND WORKING. IN THE DEVELOPMENT ON. SYSTEM ACCESSING SERVICES AND NAVIGATING IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO CONTINUE TO STAY INVOLVED AND ENGAGED WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND THOSE WHO SUPPORT THEM. SO WE REALLY CAN'T TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES TO BEST UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES IMPROVE- HOW WE CAN ACCESS SERVICES FOR THE INDIVIDUALS. AND MAKE THOSE ENHANCEMENTS SO WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WERE REALLY ACHIEVING WHAT WERE- NEEDING AND WANTING TO DO AS FAR AS SUPPORTING THOSE. INDIVIDUALS THAT- ALL STAGES OF LIFE. THE NEW DIVISION WHAT WOULD IT DO IT WOULD REALLY ENABLE US TO CENTRALIZE AND FOCUS ON ALIGNING. THE COMPLAINTS AND RESOLUTIONS- BUT ALSO GIVING US AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY EMBRACE THE CULTURAL LINGUISTIC DIFFERENCES AND SENSITIVITIES THAT THE INDIVIDUALS WE SERVE. MAKE SURE THAT WERE EMBRACING TRANSPARENCY AND UNDERSTANDING THE TRENDS. THAT WE SEE AND THAT CRITICAL AREAS OF COME. SORRY OUTCOMES AND BRINGING FORWARD- I'M RESOLUTIONS AND IMPLEMENTING THE EXISTING INITIATIVES THAT WE'VE ALREADY PRESENTED- AND HAVE ACTION ITEMS ON FROM PRIOR- BUDGET AX. FOUR KEY COMPONENTS TO THIS PROPOSAL ONE IS IMPROVING MANAGEMENT OF OUR COMMUNITY COMPLAINTS REFORMING OUR APPEALS AND FAIR HEARING PROCESS. AND ENHANCING THE DEPARTMENT'S RESOURCES FOR QUALITY ASSURANCE OF WE CAN REALLY FOCUS ON THOSE QUALITY OUTCOME MEASURES. I'M FOCUSED ON EFFORTS- REGARDING RISK MANAGEMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT- JUST COLLECTING DATA BUT WE ARE REALLY TAKING TIME TO BE ABLE TO REVIEW. AND. LOOK AT PLAY AND MITIGATE PLAN TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS. THE ROOT OF THE WEEK ON. THE REST TO INDIVIDUALS AND THEN LASTLY REALLY CREATING OMBUDSPERSON OFFICE IT'S REALLY BEEN. A GREAT EXPERIENCE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS WITH THAT SELF DETERMINATION OMBUDSPERSON WHILE IT'S VERY MUCH IN ITS INFANCY RIGHT NOW. WE'VE ALREADY LEARNED THAT BY HAVING AN OFFICE OR HAVING THE AVAILABILITY OF STAFF TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT IMPARTIAL- LATE TO THE COMMUNITY IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO OPEN UP. A BROADER NOT ONLY WITHIN SELF DETERMINATION BUT HAVE A CENTRAL LOCATION WHERE WE CAN HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE IMPARTIAL ACCESS TO INFORMATION THAT CAN BE READILY AVAILABLE TO THE COMMUNITY- I DO WANT TO JUST TAKE A SECOND SAID. THANK OUR STAKEHOLDERS. FOR THEIR CONTINUED ENGAGE. AND ALL THE INPUT THAT THEY GAVE TO HELP. AND INFORM THE KEY ELEMENTS WITHIN THE REFORM OF THE FAIR HEARING PROCESS. AND THEN ALSO WITH REGIONAL CENTERS AND DGS- THE DIRECTOR AND THE STAFF OVER IF YOU JUST HAVE REALLY- DEDICATE A LOT OF TIME TO- ALSO LISTEN TO WHAT THE CONCERNS ARE AND TO- UNDERSTAND KIND OF PROPOSAL TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. SO NOW- TURN IT OVER TO AND FUTURE PATH FOR- INTERESTING THAT OTHER QUESTIONS THAT ARE OUTLINED IN THE AGENDA THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND WELCOME MR SHRINK. THANK YOU FOR SHOULD BE UP. TO BE HERE. THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE DEPARTMENT'S. FOCUS ON OUTCOMES FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WE'RE SERVING AND- AND AS THE DIRECTOR OUTLINED THEIR MANY COMPONENT PIECES HERE BOTH IN TERMS OF INDIVIDUALS SYSTEMS AND INFORMATION. BUT ALSO OVERALL SYSTEM QUALITY ASSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT TOOK TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY DETAILED QUESTIONS- ARE SPECIFIC TO THE ONES LISTED IN THE AGENDA TODAY- WE MENTION OUR PROPOSAL- WORK ON CHANGING SPECIAL INCIDENT REPORTING- AND THAT SON OF. A REQUIREMENT IN OUR SYSTEM IT'S IN OUR SYSTEM FOR MANY MANY YEARS. HI AND SPECIAL INCIDENTS KIND OF RUN THE GAMUT OF EVERYTHING FROM. MISSED MEDICATION DOSES ALL THE WAY TO FATALITIES. AS PEOPLE. AND AS THERE'S A FAIRLY LENGTHY LIST OF THINGS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE REPORTED IN IN PART NOT BECAUSE WE WANT TO PUNISH PEOPLE FOR THOSE THINGS HAPPENING BUT BECAUSE WE WANT TO LEARN FROM THEM WHY THEY HAPPEN. AND WHAT WE CAN DO IS A SYSTEM TO PREVENT- AND IT HELPS US TARGET TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO. OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS IT HELPS US LEARN OUR OWN BEHAVIORS- INFORMS TRAINING. AND THOSE. KINDS OF THINGS. THE QUESTIONS WAS ASK WHY CHANGE ARE WE CALL. HER NEXT IT'S BEEN A FOR QUITE A FEW YEARS AND THE CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE OVER THOSE ALMOST- TWENTY YEARS OR LONGER HEAVILY BEEN INCREMENTAL. WE ARE MEETING WITH STAKEHOLDERS. ACROSS THE SYSTEM INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES REGIONAL CENTER SERVICE PROVIDERS FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS- ADVOCATES AND OTHERS. AND WE BASICALLY STARTED WITH A LIST OF HERE'S WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO. REQUIRING PEOPLE TO REPORT A NUMBER OF REGIONAL CENTERS CURRENTLY REQUIRE OTHER PEOPLE TO- SERVICE PROVIDERS TO REPORT INCIDENTS. BEYOND WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT'S REGULATIONS REQUIRE SO WE LOOKED AT AND WHAT THOSE THINGS ARE AND WHY THEY'RE IMPORTANT TO TRACK- AND THEN JUST FEEDBACK FROM EVERYBODY GENERALLY LIKE. WHAT'S LESS IMPORTANT TO YOU WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WHAT WE NOT CAPTURING THAT WOULD LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT IT AND IN SOME CASES. PARTICULARLY LIKE MEDICATION ERRORS. WHAT WHAT IS IT THAT WE WOULD LIKE IN TERMS OF MORE DETAIL SO TO. MAKE THAT INFORMATION MORE USEFUL AND ACTIONABLE FOR US. TO PROTECT PEOPLE GOING FORWARD. WELL SO WE DON'T HAVE A- PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME WE'RE ENGAGED IN WHAT I CALL THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS AND ADVANCES LAWMAKING WE ANTICIPATE AT THE PRESENT TIME THAT SOMETIME THIS FALL WILL. WILL START- WHAT WE ESTIMATE IT WILL BE A YEARLONG BILL MAKING PROCESS. THAT UPDATES- ALL OF THOSE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND HOW THE REPORTED AND TIME FRAMES SUCHER- IN THAT PROCESS TO WILL GIVE GREAT CONSIDERATION TO OF COURSE THE TRAINING OUT OF- MOST. OUR OWN DEPARTMENT STAFFS REGIONAL CENTERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS DOING THE REPORTING AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES IN THE COMMUNITY SO THAT WE ARE TRAINING ASPECT OF THAT OUT THEY'LL BE SOME IT SYSTEM- CHANGES ALSO TO CAPTURE. THOSE UPDATES THAT WE MAKE- BEFORE WE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED SO ALL TO SAY IT'S A REALLY ROBUST PROCESS WE LOVE THE COLLABORATION AND PARTNERSHIP WE'VE GOTTEN FROM THESE FOLKS. I WITH MANY OF THEM WE'VE HAD MULTIPLE MEETINGS ALREADY AND EXPECT THAT TO CONTINUE THE BEEN REALLY PRODUCTIVE AND I THINK EVERYBODY AGREES AN UPDATE IS DUE- BUT MAYBE EVEN MORE INFORMATION THAN YOU WANTED BUT A DESCRIPTION OF. THE CONTENT AND PROCESS AND- ALSO THE TIME FRAME. THAT WE'RE LOOKING OUT THERE. WITH REGARD TO THE THIS FAIR HERE FROM. AS THE DOOR MEANT- YOU KNOW GREAT APPRECIATION HERE AS WELL TO OUR STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY FOR IDENTIFYING ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE RESOLVED- AND THERE'S QUITE A LONG LIST OF THEM. I BEGINNING AT THE TOP OF PAGE FOR YOUR AGENDA DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB DESCRIBING THE PROCESS THAT THE DEPARTMENT WENT THROUGH TO LOOK AT THIS BEGINNING IN APRIL OF. TWENTY TWENTY ONE- AND THAT'S BECAUSE THESE CONCERNS WERE WERE WERE RAISED SWEETENING SIX DIFFERENT FOCUS GROUPS- ADVISORY COMMITTEES WITH INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES SOME OF OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS- SELF ADVOCATES ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS- A LONG LIST OF THEM WE ALSO IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY ONE- SENT OUT A SURVEY TO. OVER SIXTEEN HUNDRED. ASSEMBLY MEMBERS THEMSELVES ADVOCATES WHO EXPERIENCE THAT THE HEARING PROCESS IN THE LAST THREE YEARS AND COLLECTED RESPONSES FROM THEM. OTHER THAN THE THEMATIC RESULTS THAT WE GOT BACK AS A RESULT OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND THE SURVEY. ARE ALL THINGS THAT ARE REFLECTED IN OUR PROPOSED A TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND THAT'S BEFORE YOU FOR CONSIDERATION. YOU KNOW STARTING WITH THE BASICS- NEEDING MORE INFORMATION AND MORE TRAINING ABOUT THE HEARING PROCESS ITSELF AND HOW AND WHERE TO GET ASSISTANCE. IN NAVIGATING THAT PROCESS WELL THAT IT'S A COMPLICATED PROCESS SO THINKING THROUGH. POTENTIAL SIMPLIFICATIONS FOR THAT- WHAT WE'VE PROPOSED IS A THREE STEP. WE CALL IT AN OVERALL APPEALS PROCESS INCLUDING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR INFORMAL MEETINGS FORMAL MEDIATION AND THEN THE HEARING AND OFFERINGS PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PICK. UP ANY OF THE THREE ANY COMBINATION OF THE THREE OR ALL THREE. AND AFTER HAVING MADE THAT CHOICE ALSO OFFERING THE OPPORTUNITY IN THE PROCESS IS THAT. THEY'RE NOT SATISFIED IN ANY. TIME TO GO AND AMEND THEIR CHOICE. ALWAYS SEEKING ARREST AT THE END OF- LEVEL. AND FOR ON FOR STICK TOGETHER TO WRESTLE. WELL I SPOKE AS AGO ABOUT OF THE PROCESS BEING CALM- INVOLVED TO GO TO A FAIR HEARING PROCESS WELL AND EVERYTHING FROM NOTICES OF ACTION- BEING DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND- TIME FRAMES BEING TOO SHORT TO RESPOND- AND THEN CONDUCT OF THE HEARINGS THEMSELVES OF MANY FAMILIES FELT IT WAS OVERLY FORMAL- AND MADE IT KIND OF DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO ENGAGE IN A MEANINGFUL WAY IN THE PROCESS THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THERE TO SERVE THEM- AND THEN THINGS THAT- TO GO ALONG WITH THAT. OF COURSE RIGHT ADEQUATE ACCESS. IN IN TERMS OF TRANSLATION AND INTERPRETATION WELL FOR INFORMATION BUT AT ANY OF THESE MEETINGS THEMSELVES. AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THE MECHANISM SECOND SOURCE HEARING DECISIONS WHEN THE L. J. MAKES THAT FINAL RULING WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT AND WHAT HAPPENS. WHAT KIND OF OPTIONS DO YOU HAVE YES- THE DECISION IS IMPLEMENTED IN A TIMELY MANNER SO ALL OF THOSE TEAMS WERE RAISED ON THE CENGAGE WENT WITH US- AND WE HAVE PROPOSALS- IN THE TRAILER BILL. ON ALL OF THOSE TOPICS. WITH ANY BIG UPDATE LIKE THIS OF COURSE AS YOU MAKE CHANGES THEY NEED TO BE STAGED- WE'VE TALKED WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS. ABOUT THE NEED. EIGHT USUALLY BEST- DON'T FOR DOES NOT HAVE DAY. CAN NO DOES NEEDS TO BE FIRST SECOND AND THIRD. OBVIOUSLY IT'S- IF YOU GOING CHANGE THE PROCESS. OF THAT BEFORE YOU IMPLEMENT THAT PROCESS YOU'VE PROVIDED INFORMATION AND- TRAINING TO IT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS OF TRYING TO ACCESS THAT PROCESS. SO CLEARLY SOME THINGS LIKE THAT BASIC INFORMATION AND TRAINING NEEDS TO HAPPEN FIRST BEFORE WE- FULLY INTO THAT THAT PROCESS. AS WE MAKE THAT CHANGE OF COURSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S DONE CORRECTLY- WE'VE PUT IN OUR LANGUAGE FEEDBACK LOOPS- BUT WITH WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON A RECURRING ADVISORY GROUP INVOLVING THE HEARING OFFICE. OUR HEARINGS ARE OF THE ACTUAL FORMAL HEARINGS ARE RUN. OF FOR US- UNDER CONTRACT WITH DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS. AND THEY WOULD PARTNER WITH US AS WELL- IN. ALL OF THE EFFORTS WE'VE DESCRIBED IN OUR PROPOSAL- TO GET RECURRING FEEDBACK ABOUT HOW THINGS ARE GOING. ON A CAP OVER EMPHASIZE THE ABILITY NOT JUST TO LISTEN TO PEOPLE BUT TO HEAR WHAT THEY'RE SAYING. ON BROUGH AT- SO AT. AND AS THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED WE HAVE COMMITMENTS FROM DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES FROM THE DIRECTOR ON DOWN TO THEIR TEAM. SIX SPEND THAT PARTNERSHIP AND- WE'VE PROVIDED SOME RESOURCES TO DEDICATE TO THIS CHANGE AS WELL- SO YOU KNOW W'RE REALLY EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. PARTICULARLY WHEN PEOPLE ARE UNABLE TO RESOLVE THEIR ISSUES AT LOWER LEVELS TO MAKE THE PROCESS ACCESSIBLE IF YOU WELL IN THE BROADEST POSSIBLE SENSE. EXCUSE ME. THE NEXT QUESTION ON THE AGENDA ASK US ABOUT A DIFFERENT TOPIC OR WHETHER THERE WERE ANY LESSONS LEARNED WITH THE SELF DETERMINATION OMBUDSPERSON OFFICE THAT CAN BE LEVERAGED WHEN DESIGN DOES DESIGNING THE SYSTEM WIDE ALMOST FIRST IN OFFICE- AND THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES ABSOLUTELY WE'VE BOTH AFFIRMS LESSONS AND LEARNED LESSONS WELL A COUPLE THAT WE USE- IT- A COUPLE THAT WE HAVE A FIRM. WELL WE FOUND IT REALLY HELPFUL AND WE'VE GOTTEN A CERTAINLY EVEN YEARS SO THIS IS JUST HAVING MULTIPLE WAYS FOR PEOPLE TO REACH THE OFFICE YOU KNOW PHONE CALL EMAIL ADDRESS AND ALSO ON THE INTERNET THERE'S A WET INTAKE FORM WHERE PEOPLE COULD SUBMIT ONLINE. QUEST FOR HELP KIND OF MAKE NOT FROM IT'S OFFICES AS- WHILE HIRING- PERMANENT STAFF SUNDAY THAT'S A US. ON AND GROW THANKS TO KATIE HOW. ARE AT ON FIRST FORGET THIS AND HELPING WITHOUT HIRING THE SOONER WE BEEN ABLE TO OPEN THEIR ALSO STIRRED HIS CENTER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS THAT ASSISTANCE- LESSON LEARNED RELATED TO HIRING START SOONER- SO WE'RE WE'RE ON THAT. WE ARE WORKING ON PAPERWORK- AND IS FOR THE HIRING PROCESS AND WE WANT TO BE READY- JET JANET THE GROUND RUNNING ON THE PRESUMPTION THIS PROPOSAL. WOULD GET APPROVED OR NOT TO BE PRESUMPTIVE OF THAT BUT TO BE READY FOR THAT- THE OTHER THING THAT WE HAD A FRIEND IS- THE MOST IMPORTANT THING REALLY. IS HOW MUCH HOW MUCH PEOPLE REALLY NEED A PLACE TO GO TELL THEIR STORY AND TO GET UNBIASED ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE. THAT'S REALLY REALLY CRITICAL. LESSONS LEARNED KIND OF INVASION OF HAVING STAFF UP AND READY TO GO- AND TO HELP PEOPLE- WE NEED WAYS TO TRACK WITH THEIR TIMELINESS REMEMBER WHO'S CALLED WHEN THERE'S CALLED WHAT FOLLOW UP WE'VE COMMITTED TO. AND HOW THAT ISSUE WAS RESOLVED. NOT BECAUSE FIRST WERE IN PART T THATPERSON SPECIFICALLY BUT ON THE THIRD IT'S IMPORTANT TO THEM BUT ALSO TO US IN OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY. SYSTEMIC ISSUES IN THE SYSTEM. SO MISTER SWISS CABLE YOU HAVE FROM AND LATER ON A DIFFERENT PROPOSAL BOB AND HIS TEAM IN THE I. T. DIVISION IS WORKING ON A SOLUTION FOR US- SO THAT WE- HAVE A MORE FORMAL WAY OF DOING THAT. SO I BOTH LESSONS LEARNED AND LESSONS UP FROM THERE. WELL I BELIEVE THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE LISTED IN THE AGENDA OF COURSE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND APPRECIATE THEIR COMMITTEE HONOR IN THIS PROPOSAL AS A SENSIBLE IMPORTANT PART OF OUR DEPARTMENT'S ABILITY TO FOCUS ON OUTCOMES FOR THE PEOPLE. THAT WE SERVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE DO APPRECIATE THE WORK YOU'VE DONE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HEY CHRIS FOR OATMEAL DEPARTMENT FINANCE NOTHING FURTHER OUT ON THIS ITEM THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH LMAO. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR SONYA PADDOCK WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE HAVE REVIEWED THE PROPOSAL AND THE ASSOCIATED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. AND THINK THE PROPOSAL IDENTIFIES AND TRIES TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE KEY PROBLEMS THAT HAVE RAISED- IN THE- EARNINGS AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS. IMMEDIATELY WE DO NOT HAVE MAJOR CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL HOWEVER WE ARE CONTINUING TO REVIEW THE DETAILS AND WILL REACH OUT TO SUB COMMITTEE STAFF IF. WE HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS AS WE CLOSE OUT THE BUDGET. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- LET'S MOVE NOW TO SOME STAKEHOLDERS THAT WE WERE INVITED FOR THIS AND LET'S BEGIN WITH THE MISS VIVIAN ONE WITH A DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU SENATOR EGGMAN MY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE HERE TODAY NOT ONLY AS DRC ATTORNEY ASSEMBLING OF PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. WE'RE GRATEFUL TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THEM AND THE THOUSANDS OF OTHER RESEARCH IDENTITY SYSTEM. WE THANK THE DEPARTMENT FOR A KNOWLEDGE IN THAT THE CURRENT HEARING PROCESS CAN BE INTIMIDATING AND EXPERIENCED AS UNFAIR PARTICULARLY BY THOSE FOR WHOM ENGLISH IS NOT A FIRST LANGUAGE OR FOR WHOM QUESTIONING AUTHORITY. CULTURALLY DIFFICULT. AND WE APPLAUD THE DEPARTMENT FOR MAKING A PUBLIC COMMITMENT DURING THIS MATTER. DO THAT TOGETHER. IT STARTS BY GIVING DISABLED PEOPLE A SAFE WAY TO SPEAK UP WITH THE BEANS BETWEEN WHEN THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE NOT GETTING THEM. THAT CHANGE NEEDS TO HAPPEN BOTH FROM THE BOTTOM UP AND TOP DOWN. MY COLLEAGUE WE'LL TALK LATER ABOUT TOP AND- BUT I'LL START BY TALKING ABOUT CHANGE IN THE BOTTOM. WHICH MEANS ELEVATE THE VOICES OF DISABLED PEOPLE AND DESIGNING AROUND HERE EXPERIENCES AND NEEDS. FIRST WE RECOMMEND ESTABLISHING SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT CURRENTLY EXIST IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WHICH IS A COMMITTEE FOR THE SPECIFIC PURPOSE OF ADVISING THE HEARING OFFICE ON HOW TO IMPROVE HEARING PROCEDURES. OTHER HEARING SYSTEMS HAVE LONG HAD THIS KIND OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE. THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS ALREADY DOES THIS FOR ITS SPECIAL EDUCATION YOU PROCESS HEARING. ANY DEVICE RICAN'S BOTH SIDES MEET WITH THE HEARING OFFICE TO DISCUSS EVERY DAY IN THE WEEDS PROBLEMS LIKE SCHEDULING AND CALENDARING WHERE AND HOW TO SUBMIT CERTAIN DOCUMENTS REQUEST. TECHNOLOGY MEETING LOGISTICS FOR SOMEONE WITH ADD ASSEMBLY MEMBER. FIGURE OUT THE DETAILS CAN BE A BEAR TO ACCESSING FAIR HEARING. NOT JUST THE DEPARTMENT MAKES GOOD POLICY SENSE. THAT'S RIGHT VIæT COMMITTEES LIKE THIS HAVE BEEN STANDARD PRACTICE AND OTHER DISABILITY BENEFITS SYSTEMS FOR SOME TIME AND IT'S TIME TO DO THIS FOR HEARINGS IN THE D. SYSTEM AS WELL. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVING HEARING OFFICER TRAINING ARE A GOOD START STILL MISSING ONE CRITICAL PIECE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING OFFICERS TO HEAR DIRECTLY FROM THE VERY PEOPLE THAT THE DECISIONS IMPACT OFFICERS YOU SEEN IMPATIENT WITH THE PERCENT INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY WHO TALKED OVER THEM. STILL I'M FAMILIAR WITH HOW TO INTERACT WITH THEM ON A BASIC LEVEL. PEOPLE WITH IT DESERVE BETTER. WANT TO REGAIN TRUST IN THIS HEARING SYSTEM ONLY TO KNOW THE HEARING ARE HEARING THEM. THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR HEARING OFFICER TRYING TO HAVE A COMPONENT THAT GIVES PEOPLE WITH IT. DOES REPRESENT THEM AN OPPORTUNITY EVEN IF IT'S JUST ONCE A YEAR SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCES DIRECTLY WITH HEARING. SO THEY CAN LOOK AT THE HEARING ON HAVE AT LEAST SOME BACKGROUND SOME CONTEXT ABOUT WHO THEY ARE AND WHAT THEIR ISSUES IN THEIR LIVES I LIVE. AS DEFINED BY THEM. CREATING A FAIR SHARING SYSTEM STARTS WITH LISTENING TO THE PEOPLE IT SERVES. BUT IT DOESN'T END THERE IN AND THAT'S WHAT MY COLLEAGUE WAS SPEAKING. THANKS AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION NOW WE'LL MOVE ON TO YOUR COLLEAGUE MISTER WILL WIENER- FROM ALSO FROM DRC. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR IN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT PROPOSAL. I ALSO WANT TO THANK JDS AND DIRECTOR PARCHMENT FOR GETTING THESE LONG OVER TO THEIR HEARING OR FORMS ON THE TABLE. MY COLLEAGUES JUST HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF CREATING AN EQUITABLE HEARING SYSTEM FROM THE BOTTOM UP. I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN DO THIS FROM THE TOP DOWN BY CHANGING THE STRUCTURE OF THE HEARING PROCESS ITSELF. OKAY SMART. WITTY INSTEAD OF A QUALITY. BECAUSE HERE'S THE THING ABOUT THE CURRENT AWAY H. HEARING PROCESS. DESPITE THE ENORMOUS POWER IMBALANCE BETWEEN REGIONAL CENTERS AND THE PEOPLE SERVED BY THEM. IT TREATS BOTH SIDES THE SAME. IF YOU EXAMPLES WHEN HEARING IS FILE NEITHER THE PERSON SERVED OR REGIONAL CENTER HAVE A RIGHT TO COUNSEL. ALTHOUGH WE KNOW WHICH I CAN AFFORD ONE. BOTH THE PERSON SERVED AND THE REGIONAL CENTER NEED TO EXCHANGE WITNESSED TESTS AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE BEFORE THE HEARING. ALTHOUGH THERE'S ONLY ONE SIDE WITH FULL TIME STAFF TO HELP PREPARE THESE MATERIALS. HEARING OFFICER RULED SPECS BOTH SIDES TO PRESENT THEIR CASE TO THE BEST OF THEIR ABILITY. ALTHOUGH WE KNOW WHICH SIDE PRACTICE. AND BOTH THE PERSON SERVED IN THE REGIONAL CENTER CONFINEMENT PEEL IN SUPERIOR COURT TO TEN NEWS ALTHOUGH WE KNOW WHICH SIDE HAS THE RESOURCES TO DO THIS. IT'S NO SURPRISE THEN THAT 70% OF ALL CASES WITHDRAWN BEFORE THEY EVER GET TO HEARING. WHY PEOPLE ARE OVERWHELMED AT THE PROCESS AND JUST GIVING OUT. ANY CASES THAT GO HEARING HIM FOR WINNING ABOUT TYPES OF INEQUITABLE OUTCOMES THAT UNDERMINE THE TRUST PEOPLE HAVE IN OUR SYSTEMS AND UNDERSCORES THE NEED TO CREATE A HEARING PROCESS THAT LEVELS THE PLAYING FIELD. THE DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSAL IS A VERY STRONG STEP IN THIS DIRECTION. HOW PROHIBITS REGIONAL CENTERS FROM HIRING ATTORNEYS TO GO UP AGAINST DISABLED PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES AND THAT'S THE PERSON SERVED ALSO HAS AN ATTORNEY. IT ALSO GIVES PEOPLE THE OPTION TO ACCESS MEDIATION WITHOUT HAVING TO GRAPPLE WITH WHETHER TO ASK FOR A HEARING AT THE SAME TIME. TAKEN TOGETHER THESE TWO CHANGES REMOVED CONSIDERABLE DRIVERS OF THE POWER IMBALANCE THAT EXISTS BETWEEN PEOPLE IN REGIONAL CENTRES. BUT THERE'S STILL MORE TO BE DONE AND WE CAN LOOK TO THE HEARING PROCESS FOR OTHER PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS FOR GUIDANCE. LAKE TSS STATE HEARINGS GREATER EQUITY IS INTERWOVEN INTO THAT PROCESS. YOU'RE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES. BEFORE THE HEARING THE AGENCY THAT MADE THE DECISION GIVES THE PERSON A POSITION STATEMENT WITH ITS ARGUMENTS AND EVIDENCE. THE PERSON DOESN'T HAVE TO GIVE THE AGENCY ANYTHING UNTIL THE HEARING. DURING THE HEARING HEARING OFFICERS HELP UNREPRESENTED PEOPLE CAN ON THEIR CASE INSTEAD OF EXPECTING THE PERSON TO AUTOMATICALLY KNOW WHAT TO SAY OR DO. WE CALL THIS ENGAGED NEUTRALITY. WE ALSO KNOW THE HEARING OFFICERS CAN GET IT WRONG. SO AFTER THE HEARING PEOPLE CAN RECOVER ATTORNEYS FEES IF THEY APPEAL THEIR CASE TO THE SUPERIOR COURT AND WHEN. THESE THESE CRITICAL FEATURES EITHER DON'T EXIST OR ONLY PARTIALLY EXISTENCE APARTMENTS PROPOSED REFORMS. MORE CAN BE DONE. I'LL CLOSE MY TESTIMONY WITH THIS. PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES TO SERVICE SAFE PROCESS FOR RESOLVING CONFLICTS WITH REGIONAL CENTERS. ONE WHERE THE BALANCE OF POWERS LAST YEAR. WHERE PEOPLE HAVE A MEANINGFUL VOICE IN THE DECISIONS THAT AFFECT THEIR LIVES WHERE THE SYSTEM BILLS OPEN AND HELPFUL THE PEOPLE WHO REPRESENT THEMSELVES. WE WERE PEOPLE FEEL TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT A GOOD STEP IN THE RIGHT TREE IN THE DISTRACTION. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT IN THE SUB COMMITTEE TO GET IT RIGHT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY BUT DIRECTOR BRIDGMAN OR MR AS YOU BRING COULD YOU WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- FIRST JUST THE BOTTOM UP KIND OF ENGAGEMENT ON THAT THE PROCESS IS IN PLANS TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE CLIENTS AND THE CLIENTS FAMILIES VOICE CENTRAL TO THE PROCESS. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- SO FIRST WE DO HAVE WITHIN THE PROPOSAL I'M AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT IS IN CONJUNCTION WITH- DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES. ON THAT WOULD BE INCLUSIVE AND PURPOSEFUL FOR SELF ADVOCATES FAMILY MEMBERS- AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS AS TO YOU KNOW HOW WE- LOOK AT AND CONSTRUCT THAT ADVISORY GROUP AND- WELCOME AND BUT- AND RECOMMENDATIONS- AND THEN. MISTER TRIPPY SERVING AND MAY HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AS WELL. IF YOU DRINK OF. SURE THANKS THANKS AGAIN- YEAH I THINK THAT THAT POINT IS EXACTLY RIGHT WE WANT TO INCLUDE THE VOICES OF PEOPLE THAT WE'RE SERVING AND WE'RE EXPERIENCE IN THE PROCESS OF THOSE WE SERVE. THEIR FAMILIES AND SUPPORT NETWORKS IN THE PROCESS- SHARE THIS MISS MISS LINERS- RETIRED TEST AND KIND OF THE CHANGE ARE REALLY GOOD STAR WE'RE WE'RE OPEN TO TALK ABOUT WHAT I YOU STILL- WE DO HAVE- PROVISIONS AROUND THE APPEARANCE OF COUNSEL AT THE HEARINGS AS HE NOTED. ON PAGE TWELVE OF OUR PROPOSAL- WE HAVE DETAILS ABOUT THE TRAINING THAT ARE- THE MINISTRY OF WINE JUDGES WILL GO THROUGH THAT'S ON PAGE TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY THREE. ENGAGED NEUTRALITY ON THE CONDUCT OF THE HEARING OVER ALL AGES TWENTY FOUR AND TWENTY FIVE- IMPLEMENTATION OF DECISIONS MAKING SURE THAT THAT STUFF HAPPENS ON PAGE THIRTY. WE HAVE THE DIRECTOR'S ABILITY TO LOOK AT A PROPOSED DECISIONS AND THEN YOU KNOW IMPORTANTLY BACK YOU KNOW CLOSING WITH THAT THE VOICE OF THE CONSUMER. THE FAMILY WE DO HAVE A PROPOSAL FOR A STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY GROUP- IT'S ON PAGE THIRTY TWO OF THE LANGUAGE THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF THE STAFF COMMON AND- MISTER LINERS. COMMON AS WELL. AROUND THAT AND IT'S A VERY. GROUP IN A APARTMENT BUT ALSO THE HEARING. AND FRANKLY YOU KNOW WITNESSES AND WHERE DGI WAS UP WITH US THEY ARE POINT US TO THE LANGUAGE USED FOR. EDUCATION AND THE HEARINGS THAT THEY CONDUCTED HE USES A MODEL FOR THIS LANGUAGE AND YOU KNOW. EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT TRYING TO TELL YOU IT'S PERFECT. WE'RE OPEN FEEDBACK ON IT BUT ONE OF THE TO BE AWARE THAT ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE PART OF OUR- THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE A REAL. USE USE PREVIOUS MOM THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL FOR YOU- IN ADDITION TO REALLY TRYING TO EMBED THIS. THROUGHOUT THE VOICE. OF THE- THE PARTICIPANT- OKAY SO. SO I THINK WE ALL HEARD COMMITMENTS TO KEEP ON WORKING ON THIS AND CONTINUE TO INTEGRATE- VOICES OF CONSTITUENTS- AND PARTICIPANTS AND- AND I THINK WE'RE ALL GONNA BE DIVING DEEPER INTO ALL THE DETAILS. TO MAKE URE WE GET IT RIGHT. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WITH THAT I THINK WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO- AND I UNDERSTAND- DIPPY DIRECTOR CARLA CUSTOM YOU KNOW WILL BE PRESENTING FOR THIS. DISCUSS ANY OTHER YEAR IN OF SO WELCOME. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR PROBABLY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. FOR THIS SIX ISSUE THE RESEARCHING ONCE REQUEST.

AND THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM- ANY IN THIS- WE YEARS FORMER FOR. HERE IT IS ASSEMBLY CHANGED TO DELETE THE ANNUAL REPORTING WORK- AND WELL THAT SOUNDS LIKE A NEGATIVE WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING INSTEAD IS TO WEB POSTERS FOR GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND DO IT MORE FREQUENTLY- IN MY- DECADE OF EXPERIENCE A LITTLE LONGER THAN A DECADE OF EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PARTICULAR REPORT IT'S NOT ONE THAT WE GOT QUESTIONS ABOUT. AND WE THINK IN PART BECAUSE IT'S NOT STRUCTURED IN A WAY THAT MAKES THE INFORMATION USABLE FOR PEOPLE SO WE WOULD LIKE TO PUT THIS INFORMATION INSTEAD ON THE WEBSITE UPDATED MORE FREQUENTLY.

HAVING BETTER LUCK WITH THAT THE MY COMPUTER SO- APOLOGIES AGAIN FOR THE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES I'M ISSUE FIVE CONCERNS SENATE BUDGET PRIORITIES IMPROVING SERVICES FOR THE INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY COMMUNITY. THE SUB COMMITTEE HAS ASKED OUR OFFICE THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE TO PRESENT THE FOLLOWING PROPOSALS AND WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THIS DOES NOT CONSTITUTE. AN L. A- RECOMMENDATION PER SE BUT WERE READING THESE ON BEHALF OF THE SUB COMMITTEE- THE SENATE BUDGET PRIORITIES THE SENATE IS CONSIDERING THE FOLLOWING PROPOSALS TO IMPROVE SERVICES TO THE INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES IDG COMMUNITY. ONE X. CELERY BERMAN SHIN OF THE RATE STUDY APPROVED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT BY ONE YEAR TO ADDRESS STAFFING SHORTAGES AND SERVICE DISRUPTIONS. INTO REQUIRING REGULAR UPDATES TO THE RATE MODELS IN THE GDS RATE STUDY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I BELIEVE WE ARE% GOING TO HAVE SOME STAKEHOLDER INPUT ON THAT- AND THAT WILL BE JORDAN LINDSEY THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ARC IN UCP CALIFORNIA COLLABORATION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR A GREAT AGENDA- MY NAME IS JORDAN LINDSAY I'M EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ARC UNITED STRUGGLE POLICY CALIFORNIA COLLABORATION. I SPEAK TO YOU TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE TWENTY TWO OUR CHAPTERS IN TEN U. C. P. AFFILIATES ACROSS THE STATE. NUMBER THIRTY SEVEN BOARD MEMBERS COMPRISED OF PARENTS AND FAMILY MEMBERS INDIVIDUALS WITH ID. WELL AS INDIVIDUALS WITH ID TEAM I ALSO SPEAK TO ON BEHALF OF THE LATER COALITION. AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CRITICAL ISSUES FACING CALIFORNIA'S INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY COMMUNITY A FEW WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED TODAY. BUT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE TOP PRIORITY. AS A CRITICAL WORKFORCE SHORTAGE THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM. CAUSING INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES TO GO WITHOUT SUPPORTS AND SERVICES. AS WE KNOW IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE DDS RATE STUDY IDENTIFIED THAT DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES WERE BEING UNDERPAID ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION. LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE INCLUDING OF COURSE THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH LEANED INTO OUR COMMUNITY AND THREW A ROCK EFFORTS. CLUE OF COURSE YOU SENATE LEADER. AND ASSEMBLY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND ADVOCACY COMMUNITY WAS ABLE TO PASS THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RATE STUDY STARTING WITH 25% IN JUST THIS PAST APRIL. THE IMPLEMENTATION WILL INCLUDE EFFORTS TO CREATE A TRULY PERSON SUPPORTS AND SERVICES AND THERE IS REAL HOPE AND OPTIMISM OPTIMISM THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY ABOUT THE FUTURE. BUT WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE PRESENT. AS WE NOTED IN THE IT WAS NOTED IN THE AGENDA A RECENT SURVEY INDICATES THAT NEARLY ONE FIFTH OF THE WORK FORCE IS GONE SINCEMARCH TWENTY TWENTY. AND WE HAVE BEEN ON ABLE TO REPLACE THIS WORKFORCE THERE ARE LOTS OF POSSIBLE REASONS BUT WHEN THERE ARE SIGNS IN EVERY WINDOW OFFERING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER HOURLY WAGES. IN FOR WORK THAT IS LESS DEMANDING THE DIRECT SUPPORT WORK IT'S PRETTY EASY TO ASSUME THAT WAGES IS A BIG REASON PEOPLE ARE LEAVING. THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE CAN'T COMPENSATE I JUST SIMPLY RAISING WAGES WHICH IS WHY WE NEED INCREASED RATES NOW BECAUSE THAT MONEY WILL GO STRAIGHT. TO WAGES FOR DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS AND WE ARE WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN THE LEGISLATURE COMMITTEE STAFF TO MAKE SURE PROVIDERS ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR INCREASING WAGES. WHEN THAT MONEY SHOULD ARRIVE. MOST CRITICALLY I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPACT OF THE WORK FORCE SHORTAGE THE BURDEN. IS BEING SHOULDERED BY INDIVIDUALS WITH IDEA THEIR FAMILIES AS A VERY QUICK SNAPSHOT BOTH THE ARK OF CALIFORNIA'S BOARD PRESIDENT. IN PAST PRESIDENT HAVE THEIR ADULT CHILDREN MOVING OUT OF THEIR INDEPENDENT LIVING IN BACK IN WITH THEM AS PARENTS BECAUSE THERE ARE NO STAFF TO SUPPORT THEM. AND TRAGICALLY ALSO LOSING SEXUALLY HOUSING OTHER WAIVER AS A RESULT OF MOVING OUT OF THEIR INDEPENDENT LIVING. WE CANNOT WAIT FOR THE RIGHT STUDY IMPLEMENTATION TO TRICKLE OUT THE NEXT FOUR YEARS THE NEED IS URGENT WHICH IS WHY WE ARE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL THAT THE SENATE INCLUDING THIS COMMITTEE SENATE PRO TEM ACT AND BUDGET SURE SKINNER. RECENTLY INCLUDED IN THEIR BUDGET PLAN HE WON YOUR ACCELERATION OF THE RATE MODEL IMPLEMENTATION- THE RECENTLY RELEASED SENATE BUDGET PLAN WE ARE VERY VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT THANK YOU WE ARE HOPEFUL. THAT THE SENATE PRIORITY IN AS A BUDGET REQUEST ON THE OTHER SIDE BY SOME OF THE- CHEER ARAMBULA. THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR WILL COME TOGETHER TO EASE THIS TREMENDOUSLY CHALLENGING TIME FOR THE I. D. COMMUNITY. WE BELIEVE THAT BY ACCELERATING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RATE STUDY BY ONE YEAR AS A ONE TIME INVESTMENT REALLY FOR THIS YEAR. AND ALSO ACCELERATING THE QUALITY OUTCOMES BASED REQUIREMENTS SO WE CAN BEGIN TO AGGRESSIVELY COMPETE. FOR WORKERS. WE ALSO DON'T WANT TO END UP IN THE SAME SITUATION IN JUST A FEW YEARS TIME WHERE WE ARE TREMENDOUSLY UNDERFUNDED AGAIN WHICH IS WHY. WE ALSO SEE THE NEED FOR A REGULAR UPDATING OF THE RATE MODELS AND SUBSEQUENTLY THE RATES AND WE ARGUE AN EXTRA. GRATEFUL TO THE SENATE FOR ALSO INCLUDING THIS PROPOSAL IN THE SENATE BUDGET. FINALLY WE HAVE CHANGED AS A COMMUNITY SINCE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN TWO YEARS AGO AND THE RATE STUDY ANALYZED TO PREPAY INTERMIXED SYSTEM SUPPORTS AND SERVICES AND WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A NEED. FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO REQUEST AN ADDENDUM TO THE RATE STUDY THAT BRINGS NEEDED UPDATES TO RATE MODELS ELIGIBLE SERVICES AND BILLING METHODS. THIS TOO WE HAVE CERTAIN ESTIMATED TO THE COMMITTEE FOR CONSIDERATION. WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR INCLUDING THESE PRIORITIES IN THE SENATE BUDGET PLAN. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ANSWERING QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR MUCH- MISTER LINDSEY YEAH WE ARE. WE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT BEING ABLE TO DO THIS AND WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT- WORKFORCE AND WORKFORCE ISSUES HAVE BEEN A MAJOR IMPACT COMING OF THE PANDEMIC. AND IF YOU DON'T IF YOU DON'T PAY PEOPLE AS MUCH AS THEIR HEARTS MIGHT BE BIG AND GOOD I IT'S HARD TO STAY IF YOU CAN'T PAY YOUR BILLS SO- THIS IS CERTAINLY BEEN A PRIORITY TO BE ABLE TO INCREASE WAGES. ANNA AND ALSO TO BE ABLE TO HAVE. A IT IT IT DOES NOT GET IN THIS SITUATION AGAIN SO THAT WE KEEP OUR EYE ON CONTINUING TO FIND AND HAVE- ACCELERATORS WHEN AND WHERE. IS NEEDED- SO. WE'RE WERE HAPPY YOUR WE'RE HAPPY YOU'RE HAPPY- M. AND WE REALLY HOPE THIS IS GONNA GO ALONG WAY. TO IMPROVING CARE FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS- OKAY. I THINK THAT BRINGS US TO THE END. OF OUR OF OUR HEARING TODAY WE THANK EVERYBODY FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION AND THE DEPARTMENT FOR- THERE APRIL SPRING LETTERS IN THE WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE. TO THE L. A. O. AND- DEPARTMENT FINANCE AND NOW WE WOULD SEE IF THERE ARE ANYBODY HERE TO PROVIDE ANY COMMENTS PUBLIC COMMENTS. OKAY AND WE DO HAVE ONE PERSON HERE IN PERSON SO WOULD INVITE YOU TO THE MICROPHONE. WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS AMY WESTLING AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES WE REPRESENT ALL THE STATE'S TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS WHO COLLECTIVELY ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND BOWLS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES I NEED WON THE DIVISION OF COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE AND RESOLUTION I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT REGIONAL CENTERS UNDERSTAND THE ONLY WAY THAT OUR WORK IS POSSIBLE IS THROUGH COLLAB RELATIONSHIP. PEOPLE FOR FAMILY. REGIONAL CENTER SOME ISSUE DENIAL. QUESTS OR FOR ELIGIBILITY BUT THEY DO SO ONLY WHEN THEY BELIEVE THEY HAVE NO LEGAL AUTHORITY TO GRANT THE REQUEST. WE APPRECIATE THE DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSAL- THAT WILL ENHANCE THE ABILITY TO ADDRESS DISAGREEMENTS WHILE MAINTAINING OR STRENGTHENING THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN REGIONAL CENTERS IN THE PEOPLE THEY SERVE AND ESPECIALLY THE CRITICAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE SERVICE COORDINATORS AND THE FAMILIES THAT THEY SUPPORT. SUPPORT THE OPPOSE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE INCLUDING RELATING TO LIMITING THE ROLE OF COUNSEL AND BELIEVE IT PRESENTS A THOUGHTFUL APPROACH TO MODERNIZING THE REGIONAL CENTER APPEALS PROCESS HAVE WITH THE DETAILS IN THE TVO THE FIRST AND I BELIEVE MISTER TREVECCA SPOKE TO USE AROUND THE TIMELINE FOR IMPLEMENTATION THIS IS A LOT OF CHANGE AND WE AGREE THAT THE PROCESS FOR CHANGE NEEDS TO BE. A STAGED ROLLOUT THAT'S THOUGHTFUL SO THAT PEOPLE DON'T FIND THEMSELVES CAUGHT BETWEEN TWO SYSTEMS WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY AND WHAT WE ANTICIPATE DOING IN THE FUTURE. AND I CAN'T KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE REGIONAL CENTER STAFF WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTING THESE CHANGES AND WE JUST ASK THAT AS THE PROCESS CONTINUES THERE BE CONSIDERATION TO ENSURING REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE ADEQUATE STAFF TO MEET THESE NEW DEMANDS. PIVOTING QUICKLY TO ISSUE FIVE. WE AGREE WITH- THE LETTERMAN COALITION AND ARE PROUD MEMBERS OF THE WOMEN COALITION- AND MR LINDSEY'S PRESENTATIONS THAT THERE ARE REALLY TWO ISSUES THE FIRST IS A SHORT TERM FIX. HELLO RIGHT STUDY ACCELERATION WE'RE PLEASED TO SUPPORT THIS IS AN ORGANIZATION AS WELL BECAUSE WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO IN PERSON SERVICES AND TO RECEIVE THE SUPPORTS THEY NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL THE SECOND IS A LONG TERM SOLUTION WHICH IS AS YOU SAID- CARE EGGMAN TO ENSURE THAT WE DON'T END UP BACK HERE- SO THAT WE DON'T ALLOW THE SYSTEM TO FALL INTO DISREPAIR AND THIS IS PROBABLY THE MORE IMPORTANT OF THE TWO PROPOSALS IN FRONT OF YOU. BECAUSE THIS SYSTEM. DESERVE STABILITY IN THE PEOPLE THAT IT SERVES NEED AND DESERVE STABILITY. I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT- OUR CAT AS WELL AS AS HE ARE YOU CALIFORNIA ALSO HAVE A PARALLEL PROPOSAL RELATED TO THIS- THAT WOULD REQUIRE REGULAR UPDATES TO THE WAY THAT REGIONAL CENTERS ARE BUDGETED FOR CRITICAL SERVICE COORDINATION AND OTHER STAFF.
