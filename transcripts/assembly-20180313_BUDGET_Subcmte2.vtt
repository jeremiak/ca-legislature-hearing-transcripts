I THINK. IS THE EARLY EDUCATION

00:30:14.179 --> 00:30:18.917 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA WE KNOW IT'S

STORING SOME OF THE CUTS IN THE

GREAT RECESSION BUT WE HAVE A

00:30:27.392 --> 00:30:31.263 region:rollup2
LONG WAYS TO GO AND IT WILL

00:30:29.127 --> 00:30:32.397 region:rollup2
BEGIN. THAT TODAY'S HEARING WITH

OPPORTUNITIES TO RESTORE THESE

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.669 region:rollup2
CRITICAL PROGRAMS FOR

00:30:35.767 --> 00:30:39.871 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:41.540 region:rollup2
SO WITH THAT WE WILL FOCUS ON A

00:30:39.871 --> 00:30:42.974 region:rollup2
FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN AND THAT

INCENTIVIZING FULL DAY

00:30:57.055 --> 00:31:00.625 region:rollup2
KINDERGARTEN THIS IS A FOLLOW UP

00:30:58.824 --> 00:31:02.361 region:rollup2
FROM SOME SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING

00:31:00.625 --> 00:31:04.663 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE THAT THE. LEGISLATURE

00:31:02.361 --> 00:31:07.065 region:rollup2
ENACTED WITH LAST YEAR'S BUDGET.

00:31:04.663 --> 00:31:08.767 region:rollup2
ASKING FIRST CD AND THEN OUR

00:31:07.065 --> 00:31:09.735 region:rollup2
OFFICE TO LOOK AT THIS QUESTION

00:31:08.767 --> 00:31:12.838 region:rollup2
OF.

00:31:09.735 --> 00:31:14.239 region:rollup2
HOW A COMMON IS IT FOR PROGRAMS

00:31:12.838 --> 00:31:16.475 region:rollup2
TO OFFER FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN?

00:31:14.239 --> 00:31:18.176 region:rollup2
AND WHAT COULD THE STATE DUE TO

00:31:16.475 --> 00:31:19.778 region:rollup2
FURTHER INCENTIVIZE PROGRAMS TO

00:31:18.176 --> 00:31:21.813 region:rollup2
SHIFT FROM PART DAY TO FOLD A

00:31:19.778 --> 00:31:23.181 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

00:31:21.813 --> 00:31:25.817 region:rollup2
SO CD <u><c.green>.</c></u>

00:31:23.181 --> 00:31:27.619 region:rollup2
CONTRACTED WITH THE TEAM FROM

00:31:25.817 --> 00:31:30.389 region:rollup2
UCLA THEY SURVEYED.

00:31:27.619 --> 00:31:32.791 region:rollup2
NUMBER DISTRICTS ABOUT SIXTY.

00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:34.926 region:rollup2
AND FOUND THAT OF MOST OF THEM

00:31:32.791 --> 00:31:36.328 region:rollup2
ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT WERE ALREADY

00:31:34.926 --> 00:31:37.996 region:rollup2
OFFERING ONLY FULL DAY

00:31:36.328 --> 00:31:39.197 region:rollup2
KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS. OF THE

00:31:37.996 --> 00:31:40.966 region:rollup2
REMAINING FORTY PERCENT ABOUT

00:31:39.197 --> 00:31:42.501 region:rollup2
HALF OF THEM WERE OFFERING A

00:31:40.966 --> 00:31:44.469 region:rollup2
MAKES A FULL DAY IN PART DAY

00:31:42.501 --> 00:31:46.004 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS AND. THE OTHER HALF

00:31:44.469 --> 00:31:47.472 region:rollup2
WERE OFFERING ONLY PART A

00:31:46.004 --> 00:31:49.808 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

00:31:47.472 --> 00:31:50.008 region:rollup2
NOW WHAT'S INTERESTING HERE IS

00:31:49.808 --> 00:31:51.910 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:31:50.008 --> 00:31:53.645 region:rollup2
.

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:55.914 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF HOW LONG A

00:31:53.645 --> 00:31:57.616 region:rollup2
KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM IS OFFERED

00:31:55.914 --> 00:31:59.751 region:rollup2
THE STATE OFFERS THE SAME PER

00:31:57.616 --> 00:32:01.319 region:rollup2
CHILD FUNDING RATE ON TO THE

00:31:59.751 --> 00:32:03.522 region:rollup2
LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA.

00:32:01.319 --> 00:32:06.625 region:rollup2
SO UNDER STATE LAW.

00:32:03.522 --> 00:32:07.959 region:rollup2
KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS MUST WHAT

00:32:06.625 --> 00:32:09.227 region:rollup2
OPERATE AT LEAST THREE HOURS PER

00:32:07.959 --> 00:32:11.863 region:rollup2
DAY.

00:32:09.227 --> 00:32:13.632 region:rollup2
SOME PROGRAMS OPERATE MORE THAN

00:32:11.863 --> 00:32:15.634 region:rollup2
TWICE AS LONG AS THAT BUT IN ALL

00:32:13.632 --> 00:32:17.002 region:rollup2
CASES REGARDLESS OF HOW LONG THE

00:32:15.634 --> 00:32:18.804 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS OFFERED.

00:32:17.002 --> 00:32:20.438 region:rollup2
DATE RECEIVE THE SAME PER CHILD

00:32:18.804 --> 00:32:22.574 region:rollup2
FUNDING RIGHT SO I THINK THERE

00:32:20.438 --> 00:32:23.909 region:rollup2
ARE SOME QUESTIONS A IN THE

00:32:22.574 --> 00:32:25.677 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE IS WHETHER THAT

00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:27.112 region:rollup2
POLICY MADE SENSE AND IN

00:32:25.677 --> 00:32:28.914 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR. WHETHER

00:32:27.112 --> 00:32:30.248 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIATED FUNDING RATES

00:32:28.914 --> 00:32:32.684 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE OFFERED FOR FOLDING

00:32:30.248 --> 00:32:33.552 region:rollup2
PARTY PROGRAMS.

00:32:32.684 --> 00:32:36.721 region:rollup2
NOW.

00:32:33.552 --> 00:32:38.256 region:rollup2
WHAT CD TO HE'S STUDY FOUND WAS

00:32:36.721 --> 00:32:40.192 region:rollup2
THAT EVEN UNDER CURRENT FUNDING

00:32:38.256 --> 00:32:41.459 region:rollup2
POLICIES MOST PROGRAMS ARE

00:32:40.192 --> 00:32:44.162 region:rollup2
OFFERING FULL DAYS? A

00:32:41.459 --> 00:32:46.665 region:rollup2
KINDERGARTEN THAT IN MOST CASES.

00:32:44.162 --> 00:32:48.633 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT ARE NOT FULL DAY.

00:32:46.665 --> 00:32:50.302 region:rollup2
HAVE EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN

00:32:48.633 --> 00:32:52.404 region:rollup2
OFFERING FULL DAY PROGRAMS BUT

00:32:50.302 --> 00:32:53.138 region:rollup2
THEY SAID A LACK OF FACILITIES

00:32:52.404 --> 00:32:55.941 region:rollup2
AS.

00:32:53.138 --> 00:32:57.609 region:rollup2
THAT PRIMARY BARRIER TO

00:32:55.941 --> 00:32:59.945 region:rollup2
OFFERING A FULL DAY PROGRAM.

00:32:57.609 --> 00:33:01.680 region:rollup2
NOW WHAT WE LOOKED AT WAS MORE

00:32:59.945 --> 00:33:03.448 region:rollup2
THE FISCAL SIDE WE ARE INTERESTS

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:05.116 region:rollup2
IN THIS QUESTION OF WHAT ARE THE

00:33:03.448 --> 00:33:06.651 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

00:33:05.116 --> 00:33:07.986 region:rollup2
FULL THEY IMPARTED PROGRAMS.

00:33:06.651 --> 00:33:10.488 region:rollup2
AND SOMEWHAT SURPRISINGLY WE

00:33:07.986 --> 00:33:12.324 region:rollup2
FOUND THAT IN MOST CASES.

00:33:10.488 --> 00:33:12.824 region:rollup2
PARTY PROGRAMS DON'T COST THAT

00:33:12.324 --> 00:33:14.359 region:rollup2
MUCH LESS THAN FULL DAY

00:33:12.824 --> 00:33:16.828 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

00:33:14.359 --> 00:33:18.897 region:rollup2
NOW IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT A

00:33:16.828 --> 00:33:20.999 region:rollup2
COST OF A KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM

00:33:18.897 --> 00:33:22.801 region:rollup2
IS IT IT CONSISTS OF A NUMBER OF

00:33:20.999 --> 00:33:24.436 region:rollup2
THINGS. START WITH THE CLASSROOM

00:33:22.801 --> 00:33:26.838 region:rollup2
ITSELF.

00:33:24.436 --> 00:33:28.039 region:rollup2
A MATERIALS ADMINISTRATION ALL

00:33:26.838 --> 00:33:30.509 region:rollup2
THESE THINGS TEND TO BE

00:33:28.039 --> 00:33:32.277 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY MINOR ON A PER CHILD

00:33:30.509 --> 00:33:33.712 region:rollup2
BASIS BECAUSE THESE ARE. COSTS

00:33:32.277 --> 00:33:35.881 region:rollup2
THAT ARE SPREAD OUT OVER A

00:33:33.712 --> 00:33:37.315 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF CHILDREN OFTENTIMES

00:33:35.881 --> 00:33:39.417 region:rollup2
OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS.

00:33:37.315 --> 00:33:41.486 region:rollup2
IT ON A PER CHILD BASE IS THE

00:33:39.417 --> 00:33:42.621 region:rollup2
PRIMARY COST IS THE COST OF THE

00:33:41.486 --> 00:33:44.356 region:rollup2
TEACHER WHO'S LEADING THAT

00:33:42.621 --> 00:33:46.625 region:rollup2
CLASSROOM.

00:33:44.356 --> 00:33:48.927 region:rollup2
NOW IN THEORY APART A CLASSROOM

00:33:46.625 --> 00:33:50.629 region:rollup2
COULD SAVE SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE

00:33:48.927 --> 00:33:53.265 region:rollup2
COST OF A TEACHER IN ONE OF TWO

00:33:50.629 --> 00:33:56.268 region:rollup2
WAYS. ONE EIGHT EIGHT COULD HAVE

00:33:53.265 --> 00:33:57.936 region:rollup2
A SINGLE TEACHER LEADING TO

00:33:56.268 --> 00:33:59.304 region:rollup2
CLASSES EVERY DAY IT COULD LEAD.

00:33:57.936 --> 00:34:01.573 region:rollup2
OF MORNING CLASS IN AN

00:33:59.304 --> 00:34:03.174 region:rollup2
AFTERNOON CLASS OR TWO IT COULD

00:34:01.573 --> 00:34:05.210 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE. THAT TEACHER IN A PART

00:34:03.174 --> 00:34:06.678 region:rollup2
TIME BASIS.

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:07.779 region:rollup2
NOW WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT

00:34:06.678 --> 00:34:09.381 region:rollup2
NEITHER OF THESE OPTIONS ARE

00:34:07.779 --> 00:34:10.916 region:rollup2
REALLY EXERCISED OFTEN IN

00:34:09.381 --> 00:34:14.686 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA FIRST.

00:34:10.916 --> 00:34:16.254 region:rollup2
IT'S ACTUALLY AGAINST STATE LAW

00:34:14.686 --> 00:34:18.356 region:rollup2
FOR A KINDERGARTEN TEACHER TO

00:34:16.254 --> 00:34:19.658 region:rollup2
TEACH TO KINDERGARTEN CLASSES IN

00:34:18.356 --> 00:34:21.726 region:rollup2
A SINGLE DAY.

00:34:19.658 --> 00:34:24.029 region:rollup2
WELL NOW IT'S NOT AGAINST STATE

00:34:21.726 --> 00:34:25.297 region:rollup2
LAW TO EMPLOY TEACHERS ON A PART

00:34:24.029 --> 00:34:27.065 region:rollup2
TIME BASIS BUT WE DO FIND THAT

00:34:25.297 --> 00:34:28.566 region:rollup2
IT'S A VERY UNCOMMON PRACTICE IN

00:34:27.065 --> 00:34:29.734 region:rollup2
MOST CASES.

00:34:28.566 --> 00:34:32.037 region:rollup2
EVEN KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS WHO

00:34:29.734 --> 00:34:33.939 region:rollup2
ARE LEADING ONLY A SINGLE PARTY

00:34:32.037 --> 00:34:35.407 region:rollup2
PROGRAM ARE EMPLOYED ON A FULL

00:34:33.939 --> 00:34:37.142 region:rollup2
DAY BASIS WHICH MEANS WHEN

00:34:35.407 --> 00:34:38.710 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT LEAVING A CLASSROOM.

00:34:37.142 --> 00:34:40.278 region:rollup2
THE CONDUCTING OTHER ACTIVITIES

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:42.080 region:rollup2
MAYBE ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES

00:34:40.278 --> 00:34:44.015 region:rollup2
IN MANY CASES THEY'RE SERVING AS

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:46.151 region:rollup2
AN AID IN ANOTHER PART DAY

00:34:44.015 --> 00:34:47.819 region:rollup2
KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM SO HOW THAT

00:34:46.151 --> 00:34:49.454 region:rollup2
WORKS IS IT WILL BE TO TEACHERS.

00:34:47.819 --> 00:34:51.189 region:rollup2
MISS SINGLE CLASSROOM ONE WILL

00:34:49.454 --> 00:34:52.490 region:rollup2
SERVE AS.

00:34:51.189 --> 00:34:54.926 region:rollup2
THE TEACHER IN THE MORNING AND.

00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:56.595 region:rollup2
IN EIGHT IN THE AFTERNOON OTHER

00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:59.264 region:rollup2
WILL SERVE AS THE EIGHT IN THE

00:34:56.595 --> 00:35:00.432 region:rollup2
MORNING TEACHER AND AFTERNOON.

00:34:59.264 --> 00:35:02.033 region:rollup2
NOW IF YOU'RE FOLLOWING THAT

00:35:00.432 --> 00:35:03.435 region:rollup2
PRACTICE.

00:35:02.033 --> 00:35:04.536 region:rollup2
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE PARTY

00:35:03.435 --> 00:35:06.338 region:rollup2
PROGRAM DOESN'T SAVE THAT MUCH

00:35:04.536 --> 00:35:07.639 region:rollup2
MONEY IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY

00:35:06.338 --> 00:35:09.007 region:rollup2
BECAUSE HE GETS TO SHARE THE

00:35:07.639 --> 00:35:11.276 region:rollup2
CLASSROOM.

00:35:09.007 --> 00:35:12.944 region:rollup2
A AMONG TWO CLASSES OF

00:35:11.276 --> 00:35:14.946 region:rollup2
ABSTINENCE TICKETS TO SHARE

00:35:12.944 --> 00:35:16.247 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT AND OTHER MATERIALS

00:35:14.946 --> 00:35:18.283 region:rollup2
BETWEEN TWO CLASSES DISTANCE BUT

00:35:16.247 --> 00:35:21.553 region:rollup2
THESE COSTS ARE. RELATIVELY

00:35:18.283 --> 00:35:23.154 region:rollup2
SMALL BETWEEN THE TWO CLASSES.

00:35:21.553 --> 00:35:24.789 region:rollup2
BASED ON THESE FINDINGS FIRST

00:35:23.154 --> 00:35:26.458 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:35:24.789 --> 00:35:28.426 region:rollup2
UNDER CURRENT POLICIES MOST

00:35:26.458 --> 00:35:30.028 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS ARE ALREADY FULL DAY IN

00:35:28.426 --> 00:35:31.663 region:rollup2
SECOND THAT THERE ISN'T A

00:35:30.028 --> 00:35:33.465 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT FISCAL DIFFERENCE

00:35:31.663 --> 00:35:35.066 region:rollup2
BETWEEN. THE COST OF OPERATING

00:35:33.465 --> 00:35:36.434 region:rollup2
FULL TIME PARTY PROGRAMS WE DO

00:35:35.066 --> 00:35:37.969 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THE STATE'S CURRENT

00:35:36.434 --> 00:35:40.171 region:rollup2
FISCAL POLICIES.

00:35:37.969 --> 00:35:41.606 region:rollup2
ARE SUFFICIENT TO INCENTIVIZE

00:35:40.171 --> 00:35:43.108 region:rollup2
FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN BUT THE

00:35:41.606 --> 00:35:44.142 region:rollup2
STATE DOES HAVE SOME OPTIONS IF

00:35:43.108 --> 00:35:46.444 region:rollup2
HE WANTED TO FURTHER INCENTIVIZE

00:35:44.142 --> 00:35:48.713 region:rollup2
HE'S PROGRAMS.

00:35:46.444 --> 00:35:50.048 region:rollup2
FIRST BECAUSE HE BE FOUND AND

00:35:48.713 --> 00:35:51.216 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT

00:35:50.048 --> 00:35:53.651 region:rollup2
WE'VE HEARD.

00:35:51.216 --> 00:35:55.420 region:rollup2
FROM THE FIELD THAT IN MOST

00:35:53.651 --> 00:35:57.155 region:rollup2
CASES THE BARRIER TO OFFERING. A

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:58.456 region:rollup2
FULL DAY PROGRAM IS A LACK OF

00:35:57.155 --> 00:36:00.191 region:rollup2
FACILITY SPACE

00:35:58.456 --> 00:36:02.160 region:rollup2
THE STATE COULD OFFERS SOME

00:36:00.191 --> 00:36:03.895 region:rollup2
FACILITY GRANT SPECIFICALLY FOR

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:05.063 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS INTEREST IN SHIFTING

00:36:03.895 --> 00:36:07.298 region:rollup2
FROM PART DATE FULL DAY.

00:36:05.063 --> 00:36:09.501 region:rollup2
KINDERGARTEN.

00:36:07.298 --> 00:36:11.669 region:rollup2
A SECOND THE STATE COULD

00:36:09.501 --> 00:36:13.271 region:rollup2
INCENTIVIZE FULL DAY PROGRAMS BY

00:36:11.669 --> 00:36:15.140 region:rollup2
OFFERING A LOWER FUNDING RATE

00:36:13.271 --> 00:36:16.875 region:rollup2
FOR PART A KINDERGARTEN NOW

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:18.076 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE COSTS AREN'T

00:36:16.875 --> 00:36:19.844 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT.

00:36:18.076 --> 00:36:21.312 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THESE TWO PROGRAMS WHAT

00:36:19.844 --> 00:36:24.215 region:rollup2
WE DON'T THINK THERE'S A. A

00:36:21.312 --> 00:36:26.384 region:rollup2
SINGLE ANALYTICAL ANSWER FOR.

00:36:24.215 --> 00:36:27.519 region:rollup2
WHAT APART DAY RATE SHOULD BE AS

00:36:26.384 --> 00:36:30.622 region:rollup2
OPPOSED TO FULL THEY RATE BUT WE

00:36:27.519 --> 00:36:31.689 region:rollup2
DO THINK? THAT ANY CUT TO THE

00:36:30.622 --> 00:36:33.858 region:rollup2
PARK DAY RATE WOULD OFFER A

00:36:31.689 --> 00:36:35.493 region:rollup2
FURTHER FISCAL INCENTIVES FOR

00:36:33.858 --> 00:36:38.263 region:rollup2
SOME PROGRAMS TO START MOVING TO

00:36:35.493 --> 00:36:39.898 region:rollup2
FOLD A PROGRAMS.

00:36:38.263 --> 00:36:41.833 region:rollup2
I'LL LET THESE THERE. THE A TO

00:36:39.898 --> 00:36:42.767 region:rollup2
OPTIONS THAT HAVE A LOT OF

00:36:41.833 --> 00:36:45.370 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

00:36:42.767 --> 00:36:47.072 region:rollup2
DESIGN ELEMENTS HERE QUESTIONS

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:48.473 region:rollup2
I WOULD HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED IF

00:36:47.072 --> 00:36:50.542 region:rollup2
YOU GO DOWN THAT PATH AND.

00:36:48.473 --> 00:36:52.510 region:rollup2
A. OF COURSE WILLING TO ANSWER

00:36:50.542 --> 00:36:53.278 region:rollup2
ANY QUESTIONS BUT.

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:55.980 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALL MY PAPERS PREPARED

00:36:53.278 --> 00:36:58.650 region:rollup2
REMARKS.

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:59.250 region:rollup2
THANK YOU CHAIRMAN OF EDUCATION.

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:00.351 region:rollup2
GOOD MORNING DEBORAH BROWN ON

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:01.920 region:rollup2
BEHALF A STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF

00:37:00.351 --> 00:37:03.321 region:rollup2
PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TOM TOXIN AYE

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:05.523 region:rollup2
I'LL JUST BUILD ON WITH THE LA

00:37:03.321 --> 00:37:06.991 region:rollup2
O. M. REPORT WHICH PROVIDED. A

00:37:05.523 --> 00:37:09.060 region:rollup2
GOOD SUMMARY OF WHAT THE AS

00:37:06.991 --> 00:37:09.894 region:rollup2
STUDY FOUND SO WHAT I WOULD JUST

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:11.796 region:rollup2
LIKE TO DO IS JUST HIGHLIGHT A

00:37:09.894 --> 00:37:13.798 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF ADDITIONAL POINTS FROM

00:37:11.796 --> 00:37:14.866 region:rollup2
THAT OF EVALUATION SO. WE REALLY

00:37:13.798 --> 00:37:15.800 region:rollup2
AS WE LOOK AT THE RESULTS WE

00:37:14.866 --> 00:37:17.602 region:rollup2
FIND THAT THAT.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:19.337 region:rollup2
THE FINDING SUPPORT THE NEED TO

00:37:17.602 --> 00:37:20.839 region:rollup2
LOOK AT HAVING SMALLER CLASS

00:37:19.337 --> 00:37:22.874 region:rollup2
SIZES AND ART ARE BETTER AT

00:37:20.839 --> 00:37:24.142 region:rollup2
TEACHER TO TO CHILD RATIOS

00:37:22.874 --> 00:37:27.545 region:rollup2
EITHER THROUGH. I'M HAVING IT AN

00:37:24.142 --> 00:37:27.545 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL TEACHER IN THE

00:37:27.612 --> 00:37:30.782 region:rollup2
TO BEST SUPPORT THE

00:37:28.046 --> 00:37:33.017 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF. THAT FORTY

00:37:30.782 --> 00:37:35.520 region:rollup2
QUE AND THEN ALSO APART DAY

00:37:33.017 --> 00:37:38.089 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS ABOUT DO RECOGNIZE THAT

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:39.591 region:rollup2
THIS DOES HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE.

00:37:38.089 --> 00:37:40.959 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS THAT ARE ALREADY

00:37:39.591 --> 00:37:42.360 region:rollup2
HAVING A FACILITY SHORTAGE WHICH

00:37:40.959 --> 00:37:44.295 region:rollup2
IS LEADING TO THEM NOT BEING

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:45.663 region:rollup2
ABLE TO IMPLEMENT A OR

00:37:44.295 --> 00:37:47.999 region:rollup2
RESTRICTING THEIR ABILITY TO

00:37:45.663 --> 00:37:49.534 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT FULL DAY PROGRAM. I'M

00:37:47.999 --> 00:37:51.569 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT

00:37:49.534 --> 00:37:53.705 region:rollup2
THAT WAS ALSO INTERESTING WAS.

00:37:51.569 --> 00:37:56.441 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT WE CONSIDERING

00:37:53.705 --> 00:37:58.543 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENTIATION AND FULL DAY

00:37:56.441 --> 00:38:00.712 region:rollup2
VERSUS PART THEY'VE WORKED

00:37:58.543 --> 00:38:02.580 region:rollup2
PRETTY QUE SO WE HOPE SO THE

00:38:00.712 --> 00:38:04.415 region:rollup2
REPORT SHOWED THAT SOME OF THE

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:07.051 region:rollup2
TEACHERS FELT THAT.

00:38:04.415 --> 00:38:09.687 region:rollup2
WHILE THEY WOULD LIKE FULL DAY

00:38:07.051 --> 00:38:13.758 region:rollup2
FOR KINDERGARTEN IT WAS NOT

00:38:09.687 --> 00:38:16.494 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY APPROPRIATE FOR I'M.

00:38:13.758 --> 00:38:17.562 region:rollup2
T. CASE STUDENTS AND SO MAKING

00:38:16.494 --> 00:38:20.532 region:rollup2
SURE THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT THAT

00:38:17.562 --> 00:38:24.002 region:rollup2
WHEN WE WHEN WE DIFFERENTIATE

00:38:20.532 --> 00:38:28.039 region:rollup2
BETWEEN INCENTIVES FOR FULL DAY.

00:38:24.002 --> 00:38:29.374 region:rollup2
AYE CANDOR AND T. K. I'M ONE OF

00:38:28.039 --> 00:38:32.944 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THINGS WAS REALLY THAT

00:38:29.374 --> 00:38:35.113 region:rollup2
THAT I KEY FOR AYE NEEDING SOME

00:38:32.944 --> 00:38:35.647 region:rollup2
SOCIAL EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT

00:38:35.113 --> 00:38:42.554 region:rollup2
INCLUDING AND SO. HOW AND

00:38:35.647 --> 00:38:43.822 region:rollup2
ACTIONS AND SO PROVIDING

00:38:42.554 --> 00:38:47.058 region:rollup2
MORE SUPPORT FOR TEACHERS COME

00:38:43.822 --> 00:38:48.359 region:rollup2
AROUND THOSE AND WAYS TO BETTER

00:38:47.058 --> 00:38:50.228 region:rollup2
INTEGRATE BOTH THE AT

00:38:48.359 --> 00:38:51.296 region:rollup2
KINDERGARTEN STANDARDS AND THEN

00:38:50.228 --> 00:38:52.463 region:rollup2
THE LEARNING FOUNDATIONS?

00:38:51.296 --> 00:38:54.132 region:rollup2
AND WILL ALSO LOOK AT DIFFERENT

00:38:52.463 --> 00:38:56.668 region:rollup2
WAYS TO CONCERT TO PROVIDE

00:38:54.132 --> 00:38:57.702 region:rollup2
PLANNING SUPPORT FOR A DISTRICTS

00:38:56.668 --> 00:38:58.603 region:rollup2
IS THAT SO THAT THEY COULD

00:38:57.702 --> 00:39:00.205 region:rollup2
TRANSIT TRANSITION TO A FULL DAY

00:38:58.603 --> 00:39:02.373 region:rollup2
PROGRAM SO NOT ONLY THINKING

00:39:00.205 --> 00:39:03.875 region:rollup2
ABOUT. PROPS BEST PRACTICES FOR

00:39:02.373 --> 00:39:06.277 region:rollup2
FOR ADDRESSING HAVING THAT THE

00:39:03.875 --> 00:39:08.880 region:rollup2
FACILITIES CONSTRAINTS ON IN THE

00:39:06.277 --> 00:39:09.614 region:rollup2
CLASSROOM SUPPORT. I'M A PUBLIC

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.748 region:rollup2
COMMENT ON THE LA

00:39:09.614 --> 00:39:11.516 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT I THINK

00:39:10.748 --> 00:39:13.551 region:rollup2
THAT THE.

00:39:11.516 --> 00:39:14.786 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION FROM THE ALLEY

00:39:13.551 --> 00:39:16.087 region:rollup2
ó AROUND LOOKING AT PROVIDING

00:39:14.786 --> 00:39:16.821 region:rollup2
SOME.

00:39:16.087 --> 00:39:18.189 region:rollup2
SUPPORT OR INCENTIVE FUNDING

00:39:16.821 --> 00:39:18.923 region:rollup2
THROUGH EITHER GRANTS OR LOANS

00:39:18.189 --> 00:39:22.060 region:rollup2
ON THE FACILITIES WOULD BE A

00:39:18.923 --> 00:39:23.528 region:rollup2
GOOD THING FOR THE STATE TO. TO

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:24.929 region:rollup2
A SUPPORT TO THAT THAT WOULD

00:39:23.528 --> 00:39:26.431 region:rollup2
REMOVE AT LEAST THAT ONE BARRIER

00:39:24.929 --> 00:39:28.433 region:rollup2
LIMIT THAT BARRIER TO

00:39:26.431 --> 00:39:30.034 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION. AND WE WOULD

00:39:28.433 --> 00:39:31.469 region:rollup2
ALSO SUGGEST RATHER LOOKING AT

00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:33.171 region:rollup2
OTHER OPTIONS AND SUPPORTS FOR

00:39:31.469 --> 00:39:35.273 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGING MORE FULL DAY RATHER

00:39:33.171 --> 00:39:36.474 region:rollup2
THAN LOOKING AT REDUCING THAT.

00:39:35.273 --> 00:39:40.578 region:rollup2
THAT RATE FOR.

00:39:36.474 --> 00:39:43.147 region:rollup2
FOR AYE KINDERGARTEN AYE FOR

00:39:40.578 --> 00:39:45.149 region:rollup2
APART DAY PROGRAM SO WE GET

00:39:43.147 --> 00:39:46.551 region:rollup2
EIGHTY CAN COULD INCLUDE AN

00:39:45.149 --> 00:39:48.586 region:rollup2
ONGOING INCENTIVE FUNDING FOR

00:39:46.551 --> 00:39:50.088 region:rollup2
EVEN ONE TIME PLANNING SUPPORTER

00:39:48.586 --> 00:39:52.123 region:rollup2
MULTIYEAR PLANNING SUPPORT

00:39:50.088 --> 00:39:53.825 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN ONGOING FUNDING. AND

00:39:52.123 --> 00:39:55.426 region:rollup2
THEN I WOULD SAY IN RESPONSE TO

00:39:53.825 --> 00:39:57.762 region:rollup2
THAT QUESTION POSED IN THE

00:39:55.426 --> 00:40:00.765 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS THAT.

00:39:57.762 --> 00:40:02.734 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW WE COULD UTILIZE THIS

00:40:00.765 --> 00:40:04.435 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AND PERHAPS DO LOOK

00:40:02.734 --> 00:40:06.537 region:rollup2
AT THE STUDY FOR FUTURE

00:40:04.435 --> 00:40:08.973 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION UNTIL ULTIMATELY I

00:40:06.537 --> 00:40:11.376 region:rollup2
THINK WE THOUGHT THAT THAT. THAT

00:40:08.973 --> 00:40:13.845 region:rollup2
THAT EVALUATION WAS A GOOD ONE

00:40:11.376 --> 00:40:15.780 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT WAS MULTIFACETED SO

00:40:13.845 --> 00:40:17.081 region:rollup2
IT INCLUDED THE SURVEYS THE

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:19.717 region:rollup2
INTERVIEWS AND THEN ALSO THE

00:40:17.081 --> 00:40:21.619 region:rollup2
CLASSROOM OBSERVATIONS. AND WE

00:40:19.717 --> 00:40:23.087 region:rollup2
COULD REPLICATE THAT BY AND

00:40:21.619 --> 00:40:25.490 region:rollup2
DOING THAT EVERY TWO TO FOUR

00:40:23.087 --> 00:40:28.459 region:rollup2
YEARS IN THE ADVANTAGE TO THAT

00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:30.061 region:rollup2
WOULD BE YOU WOULD GET ON A

00:40:28.459 --> 00:40:32.130 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT MORE LONG TERM DATA

00:40:30.061 --> 00:40:34.365 region:rollup2
BUT WE CAN ALSO PERHAPS MEASURE.

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:37.135 region:rollup2
THE IMPACT IN TWO TO FOUR YEARS

00:40:34.365 --> 00:40:40.605 region:rollup2
AROUND THAT THE RECENT CHANGES

00:40:37.135 --> 00:40:43.207 region:rollup2
FOR IT CASE NAMELY THAT CHANGE

00:40:40.605 --> 00:40:43.741 region:rollup2
THAT JUST TOOK AFFECT AROUND NOT

00:40:43.207 --> 00:40:46.110 region:rollup2
HAVING TO HAVE TEA QUE QUE

00:40:43.741 --> 00:40:51.716 region:rollup2
BEING.

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:52.283 region:rollup2
THE SAME TIME FINANCE.

GOOD MORNING INTERNET MEDIA

00:40:52.283 --> 00:40:56.387 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

00:40:54.385 --> 00:40:57.689 region:rollup2
THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD LIKE TO

00:40:56.387 --> 00:40:58.790 region:rollup2
JUST KNOW THAT WE SUPPORT THE

00:40:57.689 --> 00:41:00.792 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET.

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:03.261 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE A PROPOSAL

00:41:00.792 --> 00:41:04.329 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC TO THIS ISSUE AT THIS

00:41:03.261 --> 00:41:05.563 region:rollup2
POINT BUT BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

00:41:04.329 --> 00:41:07.999 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

00:41:05.563 --> 00:41:09.233 region:rollup2
OKAY THANK YOU.

00:41:07.999 --> 00:41:10.568 region:rollup2
ALL START OFF WITH WITH THE LA

00:41:09.233 --> 00:41:13.104 region:rollup2
OUT FACT I GUESS THERE'S IS TWO

00:41:10.568 --> 00:41:14.939 region:rollup2
FOLD IS THAT ONE IF YOU WANTED.

00:41:13.104 --> 00:41:16.741 region:rollup2
TO TO DO SOMETHING WHAT YOU WHAT

00:41:16.741 --> 00:41:20.078 region:rollup2
COUPLE OPTIONS BUT. FRICKE FROM

00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:22.280 region:rollup2
YEAR BENEFIT FOR.

00:41:20.078 --> 00:41:24.515 region:rollup2
FOR CALIFORNIA AND FOR THE

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:26.417 region:rollup2
FAMILIES AND AND.

00:41:24.515 --> 00:41:28.252 region:rollup2
THE STUDENTS AS FAR AS A SCHOOL

00:41:26.417 --> 00:41:29.854 region:rollup2
READINESS AB WHAT WHAT DO YOU

00:41:28.252 --> 00:41:31.723 region:rollup2
THINK THE OVERALL VALUE OF DOING

00:41:29.854 --> 00:41:33.324 region:rollup2
SOMETHING LIKE.

00:41:31.723 --> 00:41:35.593 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD BE TO TO FURTHER.

00:41:33.324 --> 00:41:37.862 region:rollup2
INCENTIVIZE AND PUSH THE OTHER

00:41:35.593 --> 00:41:40.031 region:rollup2
FORTY PERCENT TO GO FULL DAY.

00:41:37.862 --> 00:41:41.165 region:rollup2
PHONE SO ASIDE SAY THEY'RE

00:41:40.031 --> 00:41:42.934 region:rollup2
THEY'RE TWO PARTS TO THAT

00:41:41.165 --> 00:41:44.802 region:rollup2
QUESTION ONE IS WHAT IS THE

00:41:42.934 --> 00:41:46.604 region:rollup2
VALUE OF INCENTIVIZING FULL DAY

00:41:44.802 --> 00:41:48.706 region:rollup2
KINDERGARTEN AND TWO IS. A

00:41:46.604 --> 00:41:50.541 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO APPROACH

00:41:48.706 --> 00:41:52.410 region:rollup2
THAT AT SAINT ON THE FIRST

00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:55.380 region:rollup2
QUESTION THAT LITERATURE IS

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:55.680 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY A LITTLE MIXED A. THE

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:56.314 region:rollup2
LITERATURE.

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.715 region:rollup2
.

00:41:56.314 --> 00:42:00.385 region:rollup2
MANY STUDIES HAVE LOOKED AT.

00:41:57.715 --> 00:42:01.986 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS GENERATED

00:42:00.385 --> 00:42:03.521 region:rollup2
BY A FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN AND

00:42:01.986 --> 00:42:04.722 region:rollup2
IN MANY CASES THEY FIND THAT

00:42:03.521 --> 00:42:05.490 region:rollup2
WHILE THERE ARE POSITIVE

00:42:04.722 --> 00:42:07.125 region:rollup2
BENEFITS?

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:08.226 region:rollup2
AND IN TERMS OF STE

00:42:07.125 --> 00:42:10.094 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WHO ATTEND FULL DAY

00:42:08.226 --> 00:42:10.862 region:rollup2
KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS TO HAVE

00:42:10.094 --> 00:42:13.464 region:rollup2
HIGHER TEST SCORES IN LATER

00:42:10.862 --> 00:42:16.000 region:rollup2
GRADES. THE BENEFITS ARE WITHA

00:42:13.464 --> 00:42:18.069 region:rollup2
IN MANY CASES RATHER MARGINAL.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.270 region:rollup2
AT SO THAT QUESTION DOES BECOME

00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:20.304 region:rollup2
IT

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:21.005 region:rollup2
HOW HIGH OF A PRIORITY SHOULD

00:42:20.304 --> 00:42:22.774 region:rollup2
THIS BE.

00:42:21.005 --> 00:42:25.877 region:rollup2
NOW.

00:42:22.774 --> 00:42:28.046 region:rollup2
IT IS THE CASE IN MANY STATES A.

00:42:25.877 --> 00:42:29.280 region:rollup2
THERE ARE DIFFERENT PRACTICES

00:42:28.046 --> 00:42:31.682 region:rollup2
AROUND HELD KINDERGARTEN

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:33.851 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS ARE STRUCTURED IN

00:42:31.682 --> 00:42:36.187 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR. AND MANY STATES PART

00:42:33.851 --> 00:42:37.522 region:rollup2
DAY PROGRAMS ARE RUN SUCH THAT

00:42:36.187 --> 00:42:39.290 region:rollup2
ONE TEACHER WILL BRIGHTEN A

00:42:37.522 --> 00:42:40.658 region:rollup2
MORNING CLASS ONE WALDRON AN

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:42.260 region:rollup2
AFTERNOON CLASS THAT MEANS THAT

00:42:40.658 --> 00:42:43.461 region:rollup2
THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT. COST

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:45.163 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE IN PROVIDING THESE

00:42:43.461 --> 00:42:46.697 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS AND THAT'S ALSO

00:42:45.163 --> 00:42:48.800 region:rollup2
SOMETHING OF THE STUDIES

00:42:46.697 --> 00:42:50.668 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY TAKE IT TAKE INTO

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.636 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT SO THE STUDIES. MANY

00:42:50.668 --> 00:42:53.838 region:rollup2
CASES SAY.

00:42:51.636 --> 00:42:54.872 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THE ADDED COST OF

00:42:53.838 --> 00:42:57.308 region:rollup2
RUNNING A FULL DAY PROGRAM

00:42:54.872 --> 00:42:57.875 region:rollup2
VERSES THE ADDED BENEFIT AND

00:42:57.308 --> 00:42:59.077 region:rollup2
THEY WILL FIND IN SOME CASES

00:42:57.875 --> 00:43:00.378 region:rollup2
THAT?

00:42:59.077 --> 00:43:01.913 region:rollup2
THAT THE COST OUTWEIGHS THE

00:43:00.378 --> 00:43:03.681 region:rollup2
BENEFIT THIS PROBABLY NOT THE

00:43:01.913 --> 00:43:06.350 region:rollup2
CASE IN CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY

00:43:03.681 --> 00:43:08.086 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OUR PART DAY PROGRAMS.

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:09.587 region:rollup2
TEND TO COST ABOUT AS MUCH AS A

00:43:08.086 --> 00:43:12.223 region:rollup2
FULL DAY PROGRAM SO EVEN ON A

00:43:09.587 --> 00:43:14.158 region:rollup2
MARGINAL. IT IMPROVEMENT AND

00:43:12.223 --> 00:43:17.628 region:rollup2
BENEFITS WILL PROBABLY OUTWEIGH

00:43:14.158 --> 00:43:19.097 region:rollup2
THE COST OF A. FURTHER

00:43:17.628 --> 00:43:20.131 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGING FULL DAY PROGRAMS.

00:43:19.097 --> 00:43:21.766 region:rollup2
NOW WITH THAT IN MIND THE

00:43:20.131 --> 00:43:24.635 region:rollup2
QUESTION BECOMES WHAT IS THE

00:43:21.766 --> 00:43:26.204 region:rollup2
BEST WAY TO INCENTIVIZE OF FULL

00:43:24.635 --> 00:43:28.372 region:rollup2
DAY PROGRAM A.

00:43:26.204 --> 00:43:30.575 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT THE APPROACH THAT

00:43:28.372 --> 00:43:32.176 region:rollup2
IS BEST TARGETED TO THE SPECIFIC

00:43:30.575 --> 00:43:34.312 region:rollup2
PROBLEM THAT WE'RE HEARING FROM

00:43:32.176 --> 00:43:36.447 region:rollup2
THE FIELD IS SOMETHING TO

00:43:34.312 --> 00:43:38.649 region:rollup2
ADDRESS AT THE AVAILABILITY OF

00:43:36.447 --> 00:43:40.585 region:rollup2
FACILITY SPACES. NOW THAT COULD

00:43:38.649 --> 00:43:42.753 region:rollup2
BE STRUCTURED IN MANY WAYS IT IT

00:43:40.585 --> 00:43:43.821 region:rollup2
COULD BE. A A GRANT PROGRAM I

00:43:42.753 --> 00:43:45.723 region:rollup2
COULD BE A LOAN PROGRAM

00:43:43.821 --> 00:43:47.692 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY CAN'T BE A CARVE

00:43:45.723 --> 00:43:49.627 region:rollup2
OUT FROM THE EXISTING PROP FIFTY

00:43:47.692 --> 00:43:51.796 region:rollup2
ONE FUND FUNDING BECAUSE OF

00:43:49.627 --> 00:43:54.432 region:rollup2
RESTRICTIONS A A IN THE LANGUAGE

00:43:51.796 --> 00:43:56.734 region:rollup2
OF THAT. PROPOSITION BUT THE

00:43:54.432 --> 00:43:57.335 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE MANY

00:43:56.734 --> 00:43:59.637 region:rollup2
OPTIONS IF IT WAS INTERESTING

00:43:57.335 --> 00:44:01.339 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:43:59.637 --> 00:44:02.273 region:rollup2
AND THEN AS FAR AS THE BENEFITS

00:44:01.339 --> 00:44:03.908 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THERE'S THE ACADEMIC

00:44:02.273 --> 00:44:05.743 region:rollup2
BENEFITS BUT OF COURSE THERE'S

00:44:03.908 --> 00:44:07.745 region:rollup2
FAMILY BENEFITS AND.

00:44:05.743 --> 00:44:09.780 region:rollup2
CHILD CARE CONSIDERATIONS IN.

00:44:07.745 --> 00:44:11.816 region:rollup2
HAVING THREE DAYS OR THREE HOURS

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:13.518 region:rollup2
THAT THAT YOU KNOW.

00:44:11.816 --> 00:44:16.754 region:rollup2
SOMETHING FREE FOR YOUR CHILD TO

00:44:13.518 --> 00:44:19.724 region:rollup2
DO VERSUS FIVE. WORKER PARA OR

00:44:16.754 --> 00:44:20.324 region:rollup2
MORE. YEAH I THINK THAT'S A FAIR

00:44:19.724 --> 00:44:21.792 region:rollup2
POINT AND IT.

00:44:20.324 --> 00:44:23.661 region:rollup2
DOES NOT APPEAR TO ME THAT THE

00:44:21.792 --> 00:44:25.630 region:rollup2
LITERATURE OFTEN TRIES TO

00:44:23.661 --> 00:44:26.430 region:rollup2
QUANTIFY THOSE BENEFITS OF THAT

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:27.331 region:rollup2
WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT'S

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:27.632 region:rollup2
MISSING FROM. THE CURRENT

00:44:27.331 --> 00:44:29.500 region:rollup2
LITERATURE.

00:44:27.632 --> 00:44:32.069 region:rollup2
OKAY.

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:34.038 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:35.439 region:rollup2
YES MISTER MADONNA SO SO WHY DO

00:44:34.038 --> 00:44:36.107 region:rollup2
WE WANT WILL A CANDOR I'M STILL

00:44:35.439 --> 00:44:37.441 region:rollup2
STRUGGLING WITH THIS.

00:44:36.107 --> 00:44:39.944 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS TO ME.

00:44:37.441 --> 00:44:41.012 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:44:39.944 --> 00:44:42.246 region:rollup2
OUR OUR CHILDREN ENTER THE

00:44:41.012 --> 00:44:43.981 region:rollup2
ACHIEVEMENT GAP WOULD BENEFIT

00:44:42.246 --> 00:44:45.249 region:rollup2
MORE FROM FULL DAY CANTOR THAN

00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:47.518 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO ART.

00:44:45.249 --> 00:44:48.953 region:rollup2
DO WE HAVE EIGHT DOT DATA

00:44:47.518 --> 00:44:50.021 region:rollup2
RELATIVE TO THAT BECAUSE WHERE I

00:44:48.953 --> 00:44:51.622 region:rollup2
COME FROM AS IT SHOULD BE AN

00:44:50.021 --> 00:44:53.524 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL OF HEARD. IT

00:44:51.622 --> 00:44:54.559 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T BE ABOUT DAYCARE WHEN

00:44:53.524 --> 00:44:56.127 region:rollup2
I HEAR PEOPLE WANT DAYCARE.

00:44:54.559 --> 00:44:58.162 region:rollup2
DAYCARES EXPENSIVE I GET IT BUT

00:44:56.127 --> 00:44:59.697 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW THAT'S NECESSARILY

00:44:58.162 --> 00:45:00.898 region:rollup2
ALWAYS THE STATE'S OBLIGATION.

00:44:59.697 --> 00:45:04.235 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE ABOUT EDUCATION NOT

00:45:00.898 --> 00:45:05.570 region:rollup2
ABOUT JUST PROVIDING.

00:45:04.235 --> 00:45:06.904 region:rollup2
YEAH DAYCARE FOR THE FULL DAY

00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:08.506 region:rollup2
I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT

00:45:06.904 --> 00:45:09.974 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I LIKE MY OWN CHILDREN

00:45:08.506 --> 00:45:11.576 region:rollup2
WENT TO PARTY.

00:45:09.974 --> 00:45:13.945 region:rollup2
DOING FINE BUT I KNOW THAT WE

00:45:11.576 --> 00:45:14.679 region:rollup2
ALSO HAVE HAVES YOU KNOW SUMMER

00:45:13.945 --> 00:45:17.081 region:rollup2
TO FALL INTO THE CHIMNEY CAP

00:45:14.679 --> 00:45:18.516 region:rollup2
THAT I IMAGINE WOULD VERY MUCH

00:45:17.081 --> 00:45:19.817 region:rollup2
BENEFIT FROM CALLED A CANTOR.

00:45:18.516 --> 00:45:20.885 region:rollup2
SUCH AS I MEAN IT TO HEAR THE

00:45:19.817 --> 00:45:21.719 region:rollup2
WORDS MOSTLY RESTORING THERE'S A

00:45:20.885 --> 00:45:23.120 region:rollup2
REAL PROBLEM OUT THERE WOULD

00:45:21.719 --> 00:45:24.889 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM BEFORE WE

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:26.090 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT THE SOLUTIONS.

00:45:24.889 --> 00:45:28.226 region:rollup2
YEAH I WILL SAY THAT THE WOULD

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:30.328 region:rollup2
IT SURE DOES OF SUGGEST THAT

00:45:28.226 --> 00:45:32.063 region:rollup2
THERE ARE ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO

00:45:30.328 --> 00:45:34.098 region:rollup2
FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN MAY JUST

00:45:32.063 --> 00:45:35.099 region:rollup2
TEND TO BE RATHER SMALL.

00:45:34.098 --> 00:45:37.001 region:rollup2
.

00:45:35.099 --> 00:45:38.536 region:rollup2
NOW I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH ANY

00:45:37.001 --> 00:45:40.838 region:rollup2
STUDIES THAT SPECIFICALLY LOOK

00:45:38.536 --> 00:45:42.673 region:rollup2
AT ARE THOSE BENEFITS LARGER FOR

00:45:40.838 --> 00:45:44.408 region:rollup2
CERTAIN POPULATIONS OF STUDENTS

00:45:42.673 --> 00:45:46.644 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE LOW INCOME STUDENTS

00:45:44.408 --> 00:45:48.145 region:rollup2
ENGLISH LEARNERS SO. THAT I AM

00:45:46.644 --> 00:45:49.547 region:rollup2
AFRAID I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT

00:45:48.145 --> 00:45:51.215 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC SHOULD AGAIN THANK YOU

00:45:49.547 --> 00:45:52.016 region:rollup2
I I JUST THINK WE SHOULD FOCUS

00:45:51.215 --> 00:45:53.517 region:rollup2
ON CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP.

00:45:52.016 --> 00:45:54.352 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN PROVIDING DAYCARE

00:45:53.517 --> 00:45:55.953 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY BECOME A LITTLE

00:45:54.352 --> 00:45:57.121 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS.

00:45:55.953 --> 00:45:59.023 region:rollup2
AND IF WE NEED TO PUSH MORE

00:45:57.121 --> 00:46:00.391 region:rollup2
DOLLARS. INTO THOSE CLASSROOMS

00:45:59.023 --> 00:46:02.260 region:rollup2
THAT HAD TO HAVE THOSE STUDENTS

00:46:00.391 --> 00:46:03.361 region:rollup2
THAT ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE.

00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:04.595 region:rollup2
TO FALL UNDER THE ACHIEVEMENT

00:46:03.361 --> 00:46:05.529 region:rollup2
GAP THAT'S WHERE WE SHOULD GO

00:46:04.595 --> 00:46:06.364 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR DOLLARS THAT'S WHERE

00:46:05.529 --> 00:46:08.833 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD GO WITH THEIR EFFORT

00:46:06.364 --> 00:46:11.502 region:rollup2
NOT JUST PROVIDING DAYCARE I GET

00:46:08.833 --> 00:46:12.103 region:rollup2
IT IS APPARENT. IT'S EXPENSIVE

00:46:11.502 --> 00:46:14.238 region:rollup2
I'D LOVE FOR THE STATE TO PAY

00:46:12.103 --> 00:46:16.607 region:rollup2
FOR IT BUT THE SAME TIME I THINK

00:46:14.238 --> 00:46:17.208 region:rollup2
A PURSUIT PURPOSE HEARS ABOUT

00:46:16.607 --> 00:46:19.744 region:rollup2
CLOSING THAT ACHIEVEMENT GAP.

00:46:17.208 --> 00:46:25.316 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

00:46:19.744 --> 00:46:25.816 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAVEZ.

00:46:25.316 --> 00:46:27.885 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD THIS

00:46:25.816 --> 00:46:29.253 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION ON. THE ROLE OF.

00:46:27.885 --> 00:46:30.855 region:rollup2
EARLY KAGYU DEVELOPMENT

00:46:29.253 --> 00:46:31.722 region:rollup2
CHILDREN FOR A NUMBER YEARS

00:46:30.855 --> 00:46:34.625 region:rollup2
CHAIR AND I THINK.

00:46:31.722 --> 00:46:36.127 region:rollup2
BOTH REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATS

00:46:34.625 --> 00:46:37.595 region:rollup2
HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THIS AREAS OF

00:46:36.127 --> 00:46:39.230 region:rollup2
AN ISSUE.

00:46:37.595 --> 00:46:41.065 region:rollup2
BUT I'M GONNA GO BACK TO.

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:42.500 region:rollup2
.

00:46:41.065 --> 00:46:43.601 region:rollup2
THE TERM USED EARLIER ON THE

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:44.335 region:rollup2
SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING THEIR

00:46:43.601 --> 00:46:47.038 region:rollup2
CHILDREN.

00:46:44.335 --> 00:46:48.806 region:rollup2
THE.

00:46:47.038 --> 00:46:51.475 region:rollup2
IS THERE ANY STUDIES IT.

00:46:48.806 --> 00:46:52.510 region:rollup2
SHOW HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE A

00:46:51.475 --> 00:46:54.111 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT IS THE BEST SETTING

00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:55.946 region:rollup2
FOR THIS IS IT. IS IT EIGHT

00:46:54.111 --> 00:46:56.914 region:rollup2
HOURS IS FOUR HOURS WHAT IS

00:46:55.946 --> 00:46:58.649 region:rollup2
ANYTHING THAT SHOWS.

00:46:56.914 --> 00:47:00.685 region:rollup2
FOR THE CHILD.

00:46:58.649 --> 00:47:03.387 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO.

00:47:00.685 --> 00:47:04.388 region:rollup2
IBM HAD DIRECTED SYSTEM.

00:47:03.387 --> 00:47:06.624 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THE WEB'S BEST?

00:47:04.388 --> 00:47:08.993 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE.

00:47:06.624 --> 00:47:11.796 region:rollup2
A I'M NOTPERSONALLY FAMILIAR

00:47:08.993 --> 00:47:13.431 region:rollup2
WITH ANY OF THAT I I WILL SAY I

00:47:11.796 --> 00:47:14.932 region:rollup2
WERE. A.

00:47:13.431 --> 00:47:16.300 region:rollup2
THE AT THE LA O. OUR PRIMARY

00:47:14.932 --> 00:47:17.902 region:rollup2
INTEREST IN LOOKING AT THIS

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:19.770 region:rollup2
QUESTION WAS ON THE FISCAL SIDE

00:47:17.902 --> 00:47:21.572 region:rollup2
SO WE WERE WE WERE NOT AROUND

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:23.207 region:rollup2
YOU.

00:47:21.572 --> 00:47:24.341 region:rollup2
YET STEP AROUND A YET I DIDN'T

00:47:23.207 --> 00:47:25.609 region:rollup2
SORT OF BUILDING ON ON MR

00:47:24.341 --> 00:47:26.911 region:rollup2
O'DONNELL'S COMMENT AS WELL JUST

00:47:25.609 --> 00:47:28.713 region:rollup2
IF I REALLY THINK WHAT WE FOUND

00:47:26.911 --> 00:47:29.046 region:rollup2
AS WE LOOK AT AND I CAN'T SPEAK

00:47:28.713 --> 00:47:31.182 region:rollup2
TO ANY OTHER.

00:47:29.046 --> 00:47:32.383 region:rollup2
BUT STUDIES BUT WE CAN

00:47:31.182 --> 00:47:34.151 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY LOOK INTO BUT AS AS

00:47:32.383 --> 00:47:35.553 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE EVALUATION

00:47:34.151 --> 00:47:37.455 region:rollup2
AND THE RESPONSES FROM THAT THAT

00:47:35.553 --> 00:47:38.856 region:rollup2
THAT TEACHERS. WHAT THEY FOUND

00:47:37.455 --> 00:47:40.524 region:rollup2
WAS REALLY JUST THIS IDEA UPS

00:47:38.856 --> 00:47:42.360 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY WHEN WE HAVE CLASS

00:47:40.524 --> 00:47:44.228 region:rollup2
SIZES AS LARGE AS THEY ARE THAT

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:46.197 region:rollup2
HAVING THE FULL DAY PROGRAM SO

00:47:44.228 --> 00:47:48.032 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW IF OF? MORE THAN

00:47:46.197 --> 00:47:49.433 region:rollup2
FOUR HOURS ALLOW THEM MORE TIME

00:47:48.032 --> 00:47:50.701 region:rollup2
TO NOT ONLY GO OVER THE THAT

00:47:49.433 --> 00:47:52.536 region:rollup2
THAT CONTENT STANDARDS WITH THEM

00:47:50.701 --> 00:47:53.971 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR WITH THEIR STUDENTS

00:47:52.536 --> 00:47:54.905 region:rollup2
BUT THEN ALSO SPEND MUCH TIME ON

00:47:53.971 --> 00:47:56.607 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL

00:47:54.905 --> 00:47:58.342 region:rollup2
LEARNING AS WELL. AND THE IDEA

00:47:56.607 --> 00:48:00.177 region:rollup2
THAT THEY COULD TAKE WHAT ONE

00:47:58.342 --> 00:48:02.780 region:rollup2
TEACHER THAT TURNED IN THE IN

00:48:00.177 --> 00:48:04.148 region:rollup2
THE EVALUATION BRAIN BREAKS SO

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:06.650 region:rollup2
IT SO HAVING THAT THE FULLER DAY

00:48:04.148 --> 00:48:08.452 region:rollup2
PROGRAM. GAVE THEM MORE TIME

00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:11.055 region:rollup2
AGAIN IT IT IT INCLUDED A

00:48:08.452 --> 00:48:12.256 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE OF FACTORS NAMELY ONE

00:48:11.055 --> 00:48:13.724 region:rollup2
STARTING WITH LARGE CLASS SIZES

00:48:12.256 --> 00:48:15.459 region:rollup2
BUT THE WHOLE AND THEY NEEDED

00:48:13.724 --> 00:48:17.895 region:rollup2
MORE TIME BECAUSE THEY HAVE A

00:48:15.459 --> 00:48:20.998 region:rollup2
LARGER CLASS EXACTLY SO MAYBE HE

00:48:17.895 --> 00:48:22.733 region:rollup2
ANSWERS A SMALLER CLASS SIZE.

00:48:20.998 --> 00:48:24.435 region:rollup2
MISS REGARDING ANY KIND OF THIS

00:48:22.733 --> 00:48:27.405 region:rollup2
ARE DOMINANT IN DIFFERENCE

00:48:24.435 --> 00:48:29.807 region:rollup2
BETWEEN MY CHILD I WENT THROUGH

00:48:27.405 --> 00:48:31.742 region:rollup2
A TWENTY TO ONE A MUCH OTHER

00:48:29.807 --> 00:48:35.646 region:rollup2
WINTER THIRTY FIVE TO ONE THEIR

00:48:31.742 --> 00:48:40.084 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE EVEN TODAY. THEREIN

00:48:35.646 --> 00:48:40.785 region:rollup2
LIES THE AND THAT THE SUMMERS

00:48:40.084 --> 00:48:42.586 region:rollup2
EFFECT.

00:48:40.785 --> 00:48:43.187 region:rollup2
CHAVEZ IS.

00:48:42.586 --> 00:48:44.455 region:rollup2
I SPOKE TO MY COMMENTS SO I

00:48:43.187 --> 00:48:45.289 region:rollup2
JUMPED AND I APOLOGIZE.

00:48:44.455 --> 00:48:46.657 region:rollup2
YOU DID REFERENCE MY COMP SO I

00:48:45.289 --> 00:48:47.625 region:rollup2
TOOK THE LIBERTY I APOLOGIZE.

00:48:46.657 --> 00:48:48.292 region:rollup2
GET IT WILL MAKE SURE WE KNOW

00:48:47.625 --> 00:48:49.093 region:rollup2
WHAT THE RULES ARE THE.

00:48:48.292 --> 00:48:49.560 region:rollup2
I WANTED TO GO ON THE ISSUE OF A

00:48:49.093 --> 00:48:53.397 region:rollup2
PARENTAL CHOICE NOW.

00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:54.031 region:rollup2
WHAT IF THE PARENTS WANT TO

00:48:53.397 --> 00:48:55.099 region:rollup2
THEIR ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:48:54.031 --> 00:48:55.599 region:rollup2
THE?

00:48:55.099 --> 00:48:56.500 region:rollup2
EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF THE

00:48:55.599 --> 00:48:58.536 region:rollup2
CHILDREN'S.

00:48:56.500 --> 00:49:01.138 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY LEANING TO?

00:48:58.536 --> 00:49:03.808 region:rollup2
I'D SALUTE CD IS A STUDY WAS

00:49:01.138 --> 00:49:04.108 region:rollup2
REALLY FOCUSED ON FISCAL

00:49:03.808 --> 00:49:05.376 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE.

00:49:04.108 --> 00:49:07.378 region:rollup2
AT SO.

00:49:05.376 --> 00:49:09.180 region:rollup2
THAT PARENTAL INPUT WOULD ONLY

00:49:07.378 --> 00:49:11.148 region:rollup2
BE IN DIRECTLY FROM WHAT IT

00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:12.216 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS THINK THAT PARENTS ONE I

00:49:11.148 --> 00:49:14.018 region:rollup2
I DO THINK THAT THE GENERAL

00:49:12.216 --> 00:49:16.821 region:rollup2
IMPRESSION IS THAT.

00:49:14.018 --> 00:49:18.756 region:rollup2
PARENTAL INTEREST IN MOST

00:49:16.821 --> 00:49:20.791 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES THE TRIPS TOWARDS

00:49:18.756 --> 00:49:21.759 region:rollup2
THE FULL DAY PROGRAMS FOR MANY

00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:22.426 region:rollup2
OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN

00:49:21.759 --> 00:49:24.628 region:rollup2
BROUGHT UP.

00:49:22.426 --> 00:49:26.764 region:rollup2
IN PREVIOUS COMMENTS HERE ABOUT

00:49:24.628 --> 00:49:28.532 region:rollup2
JUST IT CAN BE INCONVENIENT FOR

00:49:26.764 --> 00:49:30.401 region:rollup2
PARENTS WERE WORKING TO. HAVE TO

00:49:28.532 --> 00:49:32.036 region:rollup2
PICK UP. A CHILD IN THE MIDDLE

00:49:30.401 --> 00:49:33.437 region:rollup2
OF THE DAY YOU MAKE AN ECONOMIC

00:49:32.036 --> 00:49:35.639 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT WILL BETTER THE PARENTS

00:49:33.437 --> 00:49:36.207 region:rollup2
WANT AS FAR AS A SOCIAL

00:49:35.639 --> 00:49:37.007 region:rollup2
EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE

00:49:36.207 --> 00:49:38.509 region:rollup2
CHILDREN.

00:49:37.007 --> 00:49:40.077 region:rollup2
I I DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION

00:49:38.509 --> 00:49:41.479 region:rollup2
ON ON ON THAT AT THE MAKE AND AS

00:49:40.077 --> 00:49:43.347 region:rollup2
MISTER ANDERSON SAID THIS STUDY

00:49:41.479 --> 00:49:45.115 region:rollup2
WAS REALLY AROUND WHAT TEACHERS

00:49:43.347 --> 00:49:45.883 region:rollup2
AND AND SCHOOL LEADERS WANTED I

00:49:45.115 --> 00:49:47.852 region:rollup2
CAN CHECK TO SEE IF WE HAVE

00:49:45.883 --> 00:49:49.220 region:rollup2
ANYTHING. THAT THAT QUANTIFIES

00:49:47.852 --> 00:49:50.921 region:rollup2
HOW PARENTS FEEL ABOUT THE

00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:52.323 region:rollup2
LONGER DAY VERSES THAT THE

00:49:50.921 --> 00:49:53.591 region:rollup2
SHORTER DAY BUT I THINK THE

00:49:52.323 --> 00:49:55.793 region:rollup2
OTHER ISSUE IS REALLY FROM THEIR

00:49:53.591 --> 00:49:57.628 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE MORE TIME AT SCHOOL

00:49:55.793 --> 00:49:59.763 region:rollup2
IT IS EASIER FOR THEM. MS BROWN

00:49:57.628 --> 00:50:02.700 region:rollup2
WHICH IS AS FAR AS THE COST OF

00:49:59.763 --> 00:50:03.701 region:rollup2
THE. OR PAY FOR QUALITY TEACHERS

00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:05.302 region:rollup2
IN THESE PROGRAMS.

00:50:03.701 --> 00:50:08.038 region:rollup2
ARE THEY COMPATIBLE TO LET'S SAY

00:50:05.302 --> 00:50:09.840 region:rollup2
A FIRST OR SECOND GRADE. TEACHER

00:50:08.038 --> 00:50:11.208 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT TO PAY FOR.

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:12.910 region:rollup2
SO I I BELIEVE THE ANSWER IS E.

00:50:11.208 --> 00:50:14.812 region:rollup2
IS YES ALTHOUGH THAT THAT IS

00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:16.680 region:rollup2
PART OF A AT DISTRICTS A

00:50:14.812 --> 00:50:19.083 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT.

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:19.717 region:rollup2
SO WHAT'S WHAT'S YOUR VIEW

00:50:19.083 --> 00:50:20.651 region:rollup2
EITHER WHEN YOU KNOW ACROSS THE

00:50:19.717 --> 00:50:21.418 region:rollup2
STATE.

00:50:20.651 --> 00:50:22.853 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY'S GOING IN THESE

00:50:21.418 --> 00:50:24.889 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS ARE THEY PAID

00:50:22.853 --> 00:50:26.957 region:rollup2
COMPARABLE TO.

00:50:24.889 --> 00:50:29.059 region:rollup2
YES IN MOST CASES.

00:50:26.957 --> 00:50:30.461 region:rollup2
ALL MULTIPLE SUBJECTS

00:50:29.059 --> 00:50:32.429 region:rollup2
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHERS ARE

00:50:30.461 --> 00:50:34.231 region:rollup2
PAID ON A UNIFORM SALARY

00:50:32.429 --> 00:50:35.733 region:rollup2
SCHEDULE BASED ON THEIR

00:50:34.231 --> 00:50:37.268 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE AND EDUCATION. SO THE

00:50:35.733 --> 00:50:39.203 region:rollup2
ONLY DIFFERENCE THEN IS.

00:50:37.268 --> 00:50:41.238 region:rollup2
OF THEREFORE OUR CLASS OR NAY

00:50:39.203 --> 00:50:43.774 region:rollup2
TO OUR CLIENTS NO ACTUALLY IN

00:50:41.238 --> 00:50:45.175 region:rollup2
MOST CASES I'D EVEN IF YOU'RE A

00:50:43.774 --> 00:50:45.743 region:rollup2
TEACHER WHO'S LEADING ONLY A

00:50:45.175 --> 00:50:47.077 region:rollup2
FOUR HOUR CLASS. AS LONG AS

00:50:45.743 --> 00:50:49.013 region:rollup2
YOUR.

00:50:47.077 --> 00:50:51.649 region:rollup2
EMPLOYED ON A FULL TIME BASIS

00:50:49.013 --> 00:50:54.418 region:rollup2
YOU'RE RECEIVING THE SAME SALARY

00:50:51.649 --> 00:50:55.586 region:rollup2
AS SAY A THIRD GRADE TEACHER.

00:50:54.418 --> 00:50:56.954 region:rollup2
SO THE FACT THAT WAS ONE MY

00:50:55.586 --> 00:50:58.756 region:rollup2
CONCERNS ALSO IS THE MAKE SURE

00:50:56.954 --> 00:51:00.057 region:rollup2
THAT THE.

00:50:58.756 --> 00:51:01.425 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

00:51:00.057 --> 00:51:02.526 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE.

00:51:01.425 --> 00:51:04.194 region:rollup2
QUALIFIED TEACHERS IN THERE IN

00:51:02.526 --> 00:51:05.396 region:rollup2
THE ENVIRONMENT AND WE NEED TO

00:51:04.194 --> 00:51:06.864 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE.

00:51:05.396 --> 00:51:09.099 region:rollup2
PREPARED BEING GIVEN ALL THE

00:51:06.864 --> 00:51:10.601 region:rollup2
TRAINING AND AND ALL THE SKILLS

00:51:09.099 --> 00:51:11.969 region:rollup2
TO BE THE BEST LIKE AND THEIR.

00:51:10.601 --> 00:51:14.071 region:rollup2
AND THE LAST STATEMENT I'LL JUST

00:51:11.969 --> 00:51:15.873 region:rollup2
MAKE A STATEMENT NOT A.

00:51:14.071 --> 00:51:17.441 region:rollup2
MIA DANCERS THE FACT THAT.

00:51:15.873 --> 00:51:18.943 region:rollup2
RESERVE WAYNE AND I THINK SO

00:51:17.441 --> 00:51:20.811 region:rollup2
HEAVILY IN THIS IS IT DEMANDS IN

00:51:18.943 --> 00:51:22.780 region:rollup2
OUR SOCIETY TODAY WITH SINGLE

00:51:20.811 --> 00:51:24.682 region:rollup2
PARENT FAMILIES YOU KNOW DUAL

00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:26.817 region:rollup2
FAMILY WORK GAME. WHEN THEY WERE

00:51:24.682 --> 00:51:29.386 region:rollup2
CHILDREN GOING TO BE IN. AND IN

00:51:26.817 --> 00:51:30.321 region:rollup2
AN IDEAL SITUATION THE CARE BE

00:51:29.386 --> 00:51:31.322 region:rollup2
AGREES THAT.

00:51:30.321 --> 00:51:32.756 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW OF OF A CHILD WE AT

00:51:31.322 --> 00:51:34.758 region:rollup2
HOME DEVELOP AND LEARN AT THEIR

00:51:32.756 --> 00:51:35.826 region:rollup2
OWN LEVEL AND WHATEVER ISSUES

00:51:34.758 --> 00:51:37.595 region:rollup2
ARE BUT WE KNOW THAT.

00:51:35.826 --> 00:51:40.164 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT REALITY ME IN MANY OF

00:51:37.595 --> 00:51:41.432 region:rollup2
OUR NOW.

00:51:40.164 --> 00:51:43.067 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE STRESS

00:51:41.432 --> 00:51:44.668 region:rollup2
ECONOMICALLY.

00:51:43.067 --> 00:51:47.371 region:rollup2
AND THAT IN ITSELF COST AGAINST

00:51:44.668 --> 00:51:48.005 region:rollup2
GOING TO CHILDREN WE KNOW THAT

00:51:47.371 --> 00:51:49.640 region:rollup2
THE OBJECTIVE IS THAT WHEN THE

00:51:48.005 --> 00:51:52.076 region:rollup2
CHILDREN. DOES GO TO SCHOOL.

00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:53.677 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW FIRST.

00:51:52.076 --> 00:51:55.212 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE PREPARED TO DO THAT

00:51:53.677 --> 00:51:56.947 region:rollup2
INTO MANY OF OUR CHILDREN

00:51:55.212 --> 00:51:57.881 region:rollup2
SPECIAL COLOR GOING TO SCHOOL

00:51:56.947 --> 00:52:00.384 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT PREPARED BECAUSE OF

00:51:57.881 --> 00:52:01.885 region:rollup2
THEIR. ECONOMIC SITUATIONS I.

00:52:00.384 --> 00:52:02.886 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS IS AN EXTREMELY

00:52:01.885 --> 00:52:04.622 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THING WE'VE BEEN

00:52:02.886 --> 00:52:06.090 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT THIS.

00:52:04.622 --> 00:52:07.691 region:rollup2
THIS MY SIXTY YEAR HERE HERE AND

00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:08.359 region:rollup2
THE SONG DISCUSSION SHOULD WE DO

00:52:07.691 --> 00:52:10.394 region:rollup2
IT.

00:52:08.359 --> 00:52:12.129 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO DO IT.

00:52:10.394 --> 00:52:12.463 region:rollup2
I THINK WHAT YOU NEED WHERE TO

00:52:12.129 --> 00:52:14.231 region:rollup2
POINT NOW IS.

00:52:12.463 --> 00:52:15.866 region:rollup2
.

00:52:14.231 --> 00:52:17.134 region:rollup2
ARE WE BEING SUCCESSFUL IN IT.

00:52:15.866 --> 00:52:17.568 region:rollup2
AND HOW MUCH MORE MONEY TO WE

00:52:17.134 --> 00:52:19.303 region:rollup2
GOTTA PUT INTO IT.

00:52:17.568 --> 00:52:20.371 region:rollup2
IN.

00:52:19.303 --> 00:52:20.938 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS A QUESTION YOU KNOW

00:52:20.371 --> 00:52:22.773 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THE SCORECARD COMING

00:52:20.938 --> 00:52:24.208 region:rollup2
OUT.

00:52:22.773 --> 00:52:25.676 region:rollup2
IS THIS PART OF THE EVALUATION

00:52:24.208 --> 00:52:26.744 region:rollup2
AND MISS BROWN IS.

00:52:25.676 --> 00:52:28.912 region:rollup2
AS WERE EVALUATING

00:52:26.744 --> 00:52:31.015 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE.

00:52:28.912 --> 00:52:32.950 region:rollup2
SUCCESS AN EDUCATION IS IS BEING

00:52:31.015 --> 00:52:34.351 region:rollup2
MEASURE GAP. SECOND CARE WE ARE

00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:34.918 region:rollup2
REFERENCING THAT THE CALIFORNIA

00:52:34.351 --> 00:52:37.588 region:rollup2
THAT SCHOOL DASHBOARD YET SO

00:52:34.918 --> 00:52:38.389 region:rollup2
AND.

00:52:37.588 --> 00:52:40.057 region:rollup2
YOU THE ANSWER IS YES AND NO

00:52:38.389 --> 00:52:41.825 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE'D WE ALSO DON'T HAVE

00:52:40.057 --> 00:52:43.027 region:rollup2
WE DON'T ADMINISTER THE AND

00:52:41.825 --> 00:52:44.928 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE ASSESSMENTS UNTIL

00:52:43.027 --> 00:52:46.163 region:rollup2
THIRD GRADE SO IT DOESN'T HAVE

00:52:44.928 --> 00:52:47.765 region:rollup2
THAT ACADEMIC COMPONENT. BUT TO

00:52:46.163 --> 00:52:49.800 region:rollup2
THE EXTENT THAT SCHOOLS ARE

00:52:47.765 --> 00:52:51.235 region:rollup2
USING I'M THEIR OWN.

00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:52.403 region:rollup2
AT ADDITIONAL INDICATES OR

00:52:51.235 --> 00:52:54.605 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS ARE USING AYE

00:52:52.403 --> 00:52:55.673 region:rollup2
INDICATORS A LOCALLY DETERMINATE

00:52:54.605 --> 00:52:57.441 region:rollup2
ACHE INDICATORS THEY COULD

00:52:55.673 --> 00:52:59.143 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY LOOK AT THAT THERE'S

00:52:57.441 --> 00:53:00.811 region:rollup2
ALSO OTHER INDICATORS. AROUND

00:52:59.143 --> 00:53:02.980 region:rollup2
AND CONDITIONS AND CLIMATE BUT

00:53:00.811 --> 00:53:03.847 region:rollup2
AROUND THE ACADEMICS PER SE IT'S

00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:05.449 region:rollup2
NOT PART OF THAT BECAUSE WE

00:53:03.847 --> 00:53:07.384 region:rollup2
DON'T DO THIS STATEWIDE

00:53:05.449 --> 00:53:07.918 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENTS ABOUT GREAT.

00:53:07.384 --> 00:53:09.353 region:rollup2
SO THE ANSWER IS A FROM A

00:53:07.918 --> 00:53:11.288 region:rollup2
PARENT.

00:53:09.353 --> 00:53:11.822 region:rollup2
DO I BE ABLE TO GO TO ANYWHERE

00:53:11.288 --> 00:53:15.526 region:rollup2
TO SEE HOW WELL THE SCHOOL

00:53:11.822 --> 00:53:16.960 region:rollup2
DON'T.

00:53:15.526 --> 00:53:18.529 region:rollup2
E. YOU CAN BUT IF YOU'RE TRYING

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:20.764 region:rollup2
TO LOOK JUST SOLELY AT

00:53:18.529 --> 00:53:21.965 region:rollup2
KINDERGARTEN IT'S IT'S NOT

00:53:20.764 --> 00:53:23.567 region:rollup2
MEASURED IN AND THAT WAY THE

00:53:21.965 --> 00:53:24.935 region:rollup2
SAME AS IT IS. IN THE UPPER

00:53:23.567 --> 00:53:26.637 region:rollup2
GRADES.

00:53:24.935 --> 00:53:29.339 region:rollup2
SHOWS NO.

00:53:26.637 --> 00:53:31.175 region:rollup2
RIGHT

00:53:29.339 --> 00:53:31.842 region:rollup2
IT THOR EDGAR CALLED THE LEADS

00:53:31.175 --> 00:53:33.310 region:rollup2
THAT ABOUT FIVE IF I WOULD HAVE

00:53:31.842 --> 00:53:33.977 region:rollup2
MEANT THAT I THINK. THAT THEM

00:53:33.310 --> 00:53:35.412 region:rollup2
MOST OF SHOULD TO BE TAUGHT THEM

00:53:33.977 --> 00:53:36.180 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE SOME KIND OF

00:53:35.412 --> 00:53:37.581 region:rollup2
MEASUREMENT THAT THEY'RE DOING

00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:39.316 region:rollup2
IT THEY KINDERGARTEN FIRST GRADE

00:53:37.581 --> 00:53:40.784 region:rollup2
SECOND GRADE SURVEY. IF FOR

00:53:39.316 --> 00:53:42.453 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THEIR THIRD GRADE TEST

00:53:40.784 --> 00:53:43.454 region:rollup2
SCORES ARE NOT ARE NOT GREAT

00:53:42.453 --> 00:53:44.722 region:rollup2
THEY MIGHT LOOK AND SAY OKAY

00:53:43.454 --> 00:53:47.024 region:rollup2
WHERE DO WE THINK THE START AND

00:53:44.722 --> 00:53:48.158 region:rollup2
IN SOME CASES THAT MIGHT. MEAN

00:53:47.024 --> 00:53:49.393 region:rollup2
BEING ABLE TO SAY OKAY WE THINK

00:53:48.158 --> 00:53:51.462 region:rollup2
THAT THEY SHOW UP IN CANADA ARE

00:53:49.393 --> 00:53:52.529 region:rollup2
NOT PREPARED AND AND I THINK

00:53:51.462 --> 00:53:54.164 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE.

00:53:52.529 --> 00:53:55.299 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT USING ANY

00:53:54.164 --> 00:53:56.667 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURE

00:53:55.299 --> 00:53:58.502 region:rollup2
KINDERGARTEN BUT DEFINITELY A.

00:53:56.667 --> 00:54:00.337 region:rollup2
MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS PART OF

00:53:58.502 --> 00:54:01.572 region:rollup2
WHAT WILL BE HEARD OF THEIR

00:54:00.337 --> 00:54:02.706 region:rollup2
THEIR ACTIONS ARE TAKING TO TRY

00:54:01.572 --> 00:54:04.875 region:rollup2
TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR THEIR

00:54:02.706 --> 00:54:07.344 region:rollup2
STUDENTS IN THE LONG RUN. IF THE

00:54:04.875 --> 00:54:09.213 region:rollup2
FOCUS MORE ON AYE MICKEY

00:54:07.344 --> 00:54:10.981 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT THAT YOU CAN EARN

00:54:09.213 --> 00:54:12.616 region:rollup2
RTK FIRST GRADE.

00:54:10.981 --> 00:54:14.785 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S NOT.

00:54:12.616 --> 00:54:20.491 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE DON'T START

00:54:14.785 --> 00:54:21.058 region:rollup2
MEASURING THE BETH BACK TO THE

00:54:20.491 --> 00:54:21.492 region:rollup2
SORT OF THIRD GRADE WE DON'T

00:54:21.058 --> 00:54:22.426 region:rollup2
HAVE SORT OF THIS.

00:54:21.492 --> 00:54:23.393 region:rollup2
THIRD PERFORMANCE MEASURE THAT

00:54:22.426 --> 00:54:24.061 region:rollup2
WE LOOK AT THE GET THE CONVERT

00:54:23.393 --> 00:54:25.129 region:rollup2
RATE WE'VE NEVER HAD ANYTHING AT

00:54:24.061 --> 00:54:25.829 region:rollup2
THAT AT THAT EARLY IN THE.

00:54:25.129 --> 00:54:26.230 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM.

00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:27.064 region:rollup2
REFRESH MY MEMORY.

00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:28.999 region:rollup2
.

00:54:27.064 --> 00:54:30.300 region:rollup2
WE STARTED DOING TO T. K. WHEN.

00:54:28.999 --> 00:54:31.468 region:rollup2
TWENTY TEN GUY I THINK THE FIRST

00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:32.636 region:rollup2
COHORT WITH ELEVEN TWELVE BUT

00:54:31.468 --> 00:54:34.204 region:rollup2
THAT WAS THAT WAS ONLY ONE MONTH

00:54:32.636 --> 00:54:34.872 region:rollup2
SO SO RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW IT'S

00:54:34.204 --> 00:54:35.506 region:rollup2
THREE MONTHS UPELIGIBILITY IS

00:54:34.872 --> 00:54:37.107 region:rollup2
WITHIN A THREE MONTH WINDOW AT

00:54:35.506 --> 00:54:40.043 region:rollup2
FIRST IT WAS JUST. ONE MONTH OF

00:54:37.107 --> 00:54:41.245 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY WE SORT OF A FAITH

00:54:40.043 --> 00:54:42.813 region:rollup2
THAT IN SO THAT I THINK FIVE A.

00:54:41.245 --> 00:54:43.547 region:rollup2
IT'S LIKE THE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN

00:54:42.813 --> 00:54:44.882 region:rollup2
YEAR WHEN WE HAD THE FOR FULL

00:54:43.547 --> 00:54:46.116 region:rollup2
COOPER AS WE HAD NO CAME

00:54:44.882 --> 00:54:47.651 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN AND SO.

00:54:46.116 --> 00:54:49.686 region:rollup2
SO THE CHILDREN WHO AND FOURTEEN

00:54:47.651 --> 00:54:50.320 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW IF THEY'RE IN THERE

00:54:49.686 --> 00:54:51.455 region:rollup2
AND THIRD GRADES WILL BE ABLE TO

00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:53.957 region:rollup2
SEE.

00:54:51.455 --> 00:54:55.292 region:rollup2
HOW IT'S GOING IS THAT CORRECT?

00:54:53.957 --> 00:54:57.427 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THE THIRD YEAR NOW

00:54:55.292 --> 00:54:58.862 region:rollup2
STARTING TO GET A STUDENTS WHO

00:54:57.427 --> 00:54:59.429 region:rollup2
WERE INTRODUCED NUCLEAR AND WHEN

00:54:58.862 --> 00:55:01.064 region:rollup2
OUR IN THIRD GRADE AND WE'RE

00:54:59.429 --> 00:55:01.265 region:rollup2
STARTING TO FEE. THAT WE WOULD

00:55:01.064 --> 00:55:02.800 region:rollup2
HAVE.

00:55:01.265 --> 00:55:04.635 region:rollup2
ASPECTS COURSE FOR THEM THAT'S

00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:05.903 region:rollup2
THAT'S CORRECT HAVE YOU NOTICED

00:55:04.635 --> 00:55:07.504 region:rollup2
THE IMPACT YET.

00:55:05.903 --> 00:55:09.039 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK I MEAN WE HAVE I

00:55:07.504 --> 00:55:10.140 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S ANYTHING

00:55:09.039 --> 00:55:12.142 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC THING THAT WE CAN FEED

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:12.476 region:rollup2
THAT'S TIED TO THE TRANSITIONAL

00:55:12.142 --> 00:55:13.177 region:rollup2
KINDERGARTEN.

00:55:12.476 --> 00:55:15.145 region:rollup2
.

00:55:13.177 --> 00:55:16.013 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I WE ALSO IN THAT

00:55:15.145 --> 00:55:17.114 region:rollup2
DURING THAT PERIOD ALSO CHANGE

00:55:16.013 --> 00:55:18.816 region:rollup2
STEPHENS WILL HAVE THREE YEARS

00:55:17.114 --> 00:55:20.417 region:rollup2
WORTH OF TEST WE HAVE SEEN.

00:55:18.816 --> 00:55:21.618 region:rollup2
FROM THE FIRST FROM FIRST YOU'RE

00:55:20.417 --> 00:55:23.720 region:rollup2
THINKING YOU'RE A BIG INCREASE

00:55:21.618 --> 00:55:26.156 region:rollup2
IN AFFECT SCORES A LOT MORE FLAT

00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:27.191 region:rollup2
IN FROM A AND FROM THE SECOND TO

00:55:26.156 --> 00:55:29.126 region:rollup2
THE THIRD YEAR.

00:55:27.191 --> 00:55:30.160 region:rollup2
SOME OF THAT THAT I I DON'T

00:55:29.126 --> 00:55:31.695 region:rollup2
KNOW HOW MUCH OF THAT WE COULD

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.663 region:rollup2
TIED TO WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON AT

00:55:31.695 --> 00:55:33.363 region:rollup2
THE TO KILL BUT VERY SOMETHING

00:55:32.663 --> 00:55:34.998 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:55:33.363 --> 00:55:35.832 region:rollup2
RIGHT ASSUMING THAT THAT

00:55:34.998 --> 00:55:37.267 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS COULD BE LOOKING AT

00:55:35.832 --> 00:55:40.270 region:rollup2
BECAUSE DISTRICTS WILL NOW HAVE

00:55:37.267 --> 00:55:41.838 region:rollup2
BOTH STUDENTS WHO ARE WHO WERE

00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:42.673 region:rollup2
TO QUE STUDENT INSTANCE

00:55:41.838 --> 00:55:43.674 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT TAKING STUDENTS IN THE

00:55:42.673 --> 00:55:44.708 region:rollup2
FAME CLASSROOMS IN. SECOND THIRD

00:55:43.674 --> 00:55:46.610 region:rollup2
FOURTH GRADE TO YOU THAT THERE

00:55:44.708 --> 00:55:47.945 region:rollup2
MAY BE A A CONSENT THAT THEY

00:55:46.610 --> 00:55:49.179 region:rollup2
MIGHT HAVE ABOUT BENEFITS.

00:55:47.945 --> 00:55:50.247 region:rollup2
I WILL HAVE A HEARING LATER ON

00:55:49.179 --> 00:55:51.815 region:rollup2
WAS SUMMONED AND.

00:55:50.247 --> 00:55:53.584 region:rollup2
EDUCATORS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:55:51.815 --> 00:55:55.319 region:rollup2
INVOLVED THIS FOR FOUR YEARS IT

00:55:53.584 --> 00:55:56.653 region:rollup2
COULD GIVE THAT OBSERVATION.

00:55:55.319 --> 00:55:58.222 region:rollup2
ANTITANK PARA.

00:55:56.653 --> 00:55:59.790 region:rollup2
SURE WHEN WE HEAR THE PROP

00:55:58.222 --> 00:56:00.757 region:rollup2
NINETY EIGHT SIDE THAT I THINK

00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:02.459 region:rollup2
THAT CERTAINLY SOMETHING TO

00:56:00.757 --> 00:56:04.228 region:rollup2
CONSIDER WE DID AGENDA IS THIS

00:56:02.459 --> 00:56:06.296 region:rollup2
THE LAST COUPLE YEARS YOU HAD AT

00:56:04.228 --> 00:56:08.599 region:rollup2
A PANEL ON. T. K. HOW IT'S

00:56:06.296 --> 00:56:10.634 region:rollup2
WORKING AND I WILL SAY THAT. THE

00:56:08.599 --> 00:56:11.535 region:rollup2
A OUR STUDY CAME OUT TUESDAYS IN

00:56:10.634 --> 00:56:13.470 region:rollup2
LAST.

00:56:11.535 --> 00:56:15.672 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN MONTHS SEWING JACK

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:17.541 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUS SUCCESS OF TEA QUE.

00:56:15.672 --> 00:56:18.275 region:rollup2
IN THE IN THE COURT OF THE KIDS

00:56:17.541 --> 00:56:20.244 region:rollup2
THAT WERE IN THE TICKET

00:56:18.275 --> 00:56:22.980 region:rollup2
CLASSROOMS AND WILL CONTINUE TO

00:56:20.244 --> 00:56:25.415 region:rollup2
TO TO TALK ABOUT THAT. THIS THIS

00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:26.950 region:rollup2
IS S. FOCUS PRIMARILY TODAY ON

00:56:25.415 --> 00:56:29.519 region:rollup2
THE EARLY AT PROPOSALS AND WE

00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:31.989 region:rollup2
DID PUT IN. THIS PIECE I'M KIND

00:56:29.519 --> 00:56:33.523 region:rollup2
OF AT. THE HYBRID WHAT INSPIRES.

00:56:31.989 --> 00:56:35.926 region:rollup2
A FULL DAY QUE THANK YOU.

00:56:33.523 --> 00:56:37.261 region:rollup2
SOME REMEMBER LIMON.

00:56:35.926 --> 00:56:38.662 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU AND I REGRET THAT I

00:56:37.261 --> 00:56:39.897 region:rollup2
AM JOINING THE CONVERSATION A

00:56:38.662 --> 00:56:41.632 region:rollup2
LATE THAT FROM MY AYE.

00:56:39.897 --> 00:56:42.799 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I ALSO KIND OF WANTING

00:56:41.632 --> 00:56:45.202 region:rollup2
TO COMMENT ON.

00:56:42.799 --> 00:56:46.970 region:rollup2
IN. WHAT THE EDUCATIONAL

00:56:45.202 --> 00:56:48.238 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES MIGHT BE RIGHT SO

00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:49.206 region:rollup2
THERE'S THE PIECE THAT'S BEEN

00:56:48.238 --> 00:56:50.374 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED WHICH IS THE

00:56:49.206 --> 00:56:51.775 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT THE FINANCIAL

00:56:50.374 --> 00:56:53.744 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT WE MAKE IN LOOKING

00:56:51.775 --> 00:56:56.413 region:rollup2
INTO AT A FULL DAY PROGRAM?

00:56:53.744 --> 00:56:57.781 region:rollup2
ANY THINK THAT AT LEAST FOR ME

00:56:56.413 --> 00:56:58.582 region:rollup2
MY THOUGHTS ON WHETHER THE

00:56:57.781 --> 00:57:01.218 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT.

00:56:58.582 --> 00:57:02.786 region:rollup2
IT IS THE RIGHT APPROACH ALSO

00:57:01.218 --> 00:57:03.987 region:rollup2
DEPENDS ON THE OUTCOMES WE GET

00:57:02.786 --> 00:57:06.356 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT THERE'S BEEN.

00:57:03.987 --> 00:57:07.624 region:rollup2
A LOT OF RESEARCH ON EARLY

00:57:06.356 --> 00:57:09.092 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION PROGRAMS EARLY

00:57:07.624 --> 00:57:11.061 region:rollup2
CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS AND THE

00:57:09.092 --> 00:57:12.696 region:rollup2
IMPACT THEY HAVE PARTICULARLY ON

00:57:11.061 --> 00:57:13.964 region:rollup2
FIRST NATION COLLEGE BOUND.

00:57:12.696 --> 00:57:15.299 region:rollup2
STUDENTS COMING FROM LOW INCOME

00:57:13.964 --> 00:57:16.133 region:rollup2
BACKGROUNDS AND.

00:57:15.299 --> 00:57:17.734 region:rollup2
.

00:57:16.133 --> 00:57:19.536 region:rollup2
I YOU I THINK YOU MENTIONED THE

00:57:17.734 --> 00:57:21.204 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT.

00:57:19.536 --> 00:57:22.706 region:rollup2
CASE THAT CASE I AM I MAKING

00:57:21.204 --> 00:57:23.907 region:rollup2
THAT UP IS THAT I FEEL LIKE

00:57:22.706 --> 00:57:24.941 region:rollup2
THERE'S A AT LEAST IN THE SCHOOL

00:57:23.907 --> 00:57:26.777 region:rollup2
DISTRICT AS A PART OF A SCHOOL

00:57:24.941 --> 00:57:28.445 region:rollup2
BOARD WE DID HAVE A KINDERGARTEN

00:57:26.777 --> 00:57:28.812 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT TEST.

00:57:28.445 --> 00:57:30.180 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S HOW.

00:57:28.812 --> 00:57:31.415 region:rollup2
.

00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:34.084 region:rollup2
IT YOU KNOW IT'S WHEN YOU SIT

00:57:31.415 --> 00:57:35.686 region:rollup2
DOWN SHAPES EITHER THE I MEAN I

00:57:34.084 --> 00:57:35.886 region:rollup2
SAT THROUGH THEM AND WATCH THEM.

00:57:35.686 --> 00:57:37.854 region:rollup2
AND.

00:57:35.886 --> 00:57:40.057 region:rollup2
.

00:57:37.854 --> 00:57:40.757 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A CLEAR DIFFERENCE

00:57:40.057 --> 00:57:45.195 region:rollup2
BETWEEN.

00:57:40.757 --> 00:57:46.630 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WHO HAD A PRIOR BY YOU

00:57:45.195 --> 00:57:48.432 region:rollup2
KNOW WHETHER IT WAS T. K. OR

00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:49.433 region:rollup2
PRESCHOOL OPPORTUNITIES VERSUS

00:57:48.432 --> 00:57:51.268 region:rollup2
THOSE THAT DIDN'T.

00:57:49.433 --> 00:57:52.869 region:rollup2
I MEAN YOU HAVE THE FIRST FIVE

00:57:51.268 --> 00:57:54.271 region:rollup2
MODEL THAT CONSTANTLY TALKS

00:57:52.869 --> 00:57:56.039 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE THREE YOU KNOW MILLION

00:57:54.271 --> 00:57:58.075 region:rollup2
WORDS THAT STUDENTS ARE NOT

00:57:56.039 --> 00:57:59.343 region:rollup2
EXPOSED TO IF THEY DON'T HAVE AN

00:57:58.075 --> 00:58:01.044 region:rollup2
EARLY CHILDHOOD CHILDHOOD KIND

00:57:59.343 --> 00:58:02.245 region:rollup2
OF EDUCATION PROGRAM. AND SO I

00:58:01.044 --> 00:58:03.780 region:rollup2
JUST DON'T KNOW IF WE COULD

00:58:02.245 --> 00:58:05.415 region:rollup2
COMMENTS A LITTLE BIT MORE ON

00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:06.383 region:rollup2
THE EXPECTED OUTCOME FOR AN

00:58:05.415 --> 00:58:07.918 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT

00:58:06.383 --> 00:58:08.518 region:rollup2
UNLIKE THIS THAT THERE ENOUGH

00:58:07.918 --> 00:58:09.353 region:rollup2
THERE'S A FINANCIAL INVESTMENT

00:58:08.518 --> 00:58:11.521 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:58:09.353 --> 00:58:13.357 region:rollup2
THE OUTCOME OF TRANSITIONING TO

00:58:11.521 --> 00:58:17.127 region:rollup2
FULL DAY AND WHETHER OR NOT

00:58:13.357 --> 00:58:18.695 region:rollup2
THERE IS A BELIEF THAT I.

00:58:17.127 --> 00:58:20.097 region:rollup2
THAT THIS WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE A

00:58:18.695 --> 00:58:21.365 region:rollup2
GREATER IMPACT ON.

00:58:20.097 --> 00:58:23.633 region:rollup2
FIRST GENERATION LOW INCOME

00:58:21.365 --> 00:58:28.338 region:rollup2
STUDENTS AS OPPOSED TO STUDENTS

00:58:23.633 --> 00:58:30.607 region:rollup2
UP TO OTHER STUDENTS.

00:58:28.338 --> 00:58:30.807 region:rollup2
A.

00:58:30.607 --> 00:58:32.442 region:rollup2
YEAH.

00:58:30.807 --> 00:58:34.911 region:rollup2
SO.

00:58:32.442 --> 00:58:36.413 region:rollup2
I I WOULD SAY THAT THE BILL OF

00:58:34.911 --> 00:58:37.714 region:rollup2
LITERATURE THAT'S WILL DONE

00:58:36.413 --> 00:58:39.783 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY THE QUESTION OF THE

00:58:37.714 --> 00:58:41.184 region:rollup2
ACADEMIC BENEFITS FOR A FULL DAY

00:58:39.783 --> 00:58:43.153 region:rollup2
VERSES PARTY PROGRAMS HAS

00:58:41.184 --> 00:58:44.388 region:rollup2
GENERALLY CONCLUDED THAT THERE

00:58:43.153 --> 00:58:45.989 region:rollup2
ARE BENEFITS FOR FULL DAY

00:58:44.388 --> 00:58:47.724 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS BUT THEY TEND TO BE

00:58:45.989 --> 00:58:49.926 region:rollup2
QUITE SMALL. CERTAIN THAT

00:58:47.724 --> 00:58:51.695 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY STUDENTS TO ATTEND

00:58:49.926 --> 00:58:53.663 region:rollup2
A FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM

00:58:51.695 --> 00:58:55.232 region:rollup2
TEND TO DO BETTER ON TEST SCORES

00:58:53.663 --> 00:58:57.634 region:rollup2
IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS BUT THE

00:58:55.232 --> 00:59:00.370 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT IS A IS IN MANY

00:58:57.634 --> 00:59:01.338 region:rollup2
CASES MARGINAL.

00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:02.539 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD JUST ADD THAT YOU

00:59:01.338 --> 00:59:03.774 region:rollup2
THAT YOU ARE CORRECT THERE ARE A

00:59:02.539 --> 00:59:05.075 region:rollup2
VARIETY OF KINDERGARTEN

00:59:03.774 --> 00:59:06.043 region:rollup2
READINESS ASSESSMENTS THE CASE

00:59:05.075 --> 00:59:07.511 region:rollup2
THAT BEING ONE OF ON THE

00:59:06.043 --> 00:59:09.079 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT HAS ONE. CALLED THE

00:59:07.511 --> 00:59:10.247 region:rollup2
DESIRED RESULTS DEVELOPMENTAL

00:59:09.079 --> 00:59:10.814 region:rollup2
PROFILES SO THERE ARE A VARIETY

00:59:10.247 --> 00:59:12.482 region:rollup2
OF ASSESSMENTS THAT YOU CAN

00:59:10.814 --> 00:59:14.584 region:rollup2
GIVE.

00:59:12.482 --> 00:59:16.219 region:rollup2
TIP PRESCHOOLERS AND AND THEN

00:59:14.584 --> 00:59:17.888 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ENTERING T. CARE QUE

00:59:16.219 --> 00:59:20.023 region:rollup2
THAT ASSESS THEIR KINDERGARTEN

00:59:17.888 --> 00:59:21.358 region:rollup2
READINESS.

00:59:20.023 --> 00:59:22.592 region:rollup2
AND I WILL NOTE THE SOMEONE

00:59:21.358 --> 00:59:24.661 region:rollup2
MARILYN ON THAT THAT NEXT

00:59:22.592 --> 00:59:26.763 region:rollup2
THREE ITEMS ARE REALLY GET INTO

00:59:24.661 --> 00:59:28.598 region:rollup2
THE LARGER QUESTION ON.

00:59:26.763 --> 00:59:30.367 region:rollup2
I PREPARATION SUCCESS FOR OUR

00:59:28.598 --> 00:59:31.301 region:rollup2
YOUNGEST LEARNERS SO WITH THAT

00:59:30.367 --> 00:59:33.603 region:rollup2
SCRIPTURE CAN ADJUST MATHIS

00:59:31.301 --> 00:59:35.105 region:rollup2
O'DONNELL QUESTION A COMMENT BUT

00:59:33.603 --> 00:59:36.006 region:rollup2

STRENGTHEN POLICY.

01:52:49.463 --> 01:52:52.599 region:rollup2
OUR FOCUS IS ON THE FEDERAL FOOD

01:52:51.231 --> 01:52:54.868 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS LIKE THE CHILD ADULT

01:52:52.599 --> 01:52:56.637 region:rollup2

YOUNGER CHILDREN.

01:52:56.637 --> 01:53:00.474 region:rollup2
STATE NATIONAL SURVEYS SHOW THAT

01:52:58.238 --> 01:53:02.009 region:rollup2
MOST AMERICANS CONSUME FAR FEWER

01:53:00.474 --> 01:53:03.377 region:rollup2

PREFERENCES AND DIETARY HABITS

01:53:13.987 --> 01:53:17.190 region:rollup2
THAT WILL LAST A LIFETIME.

01:53:15.722 --> 01:53:18.191 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY FRUIT AND

01:53:17.190 --> 01:53:20.093 region:rollup2

01:53:18.191 --> 01:53:21.294 region:rollup2
