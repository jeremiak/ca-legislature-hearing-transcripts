THOSE THOUGHTS. BUT IT'S REALLY GREAT TO BE HERE TODAY AT THE CAL POLY POMONA CAMPUS YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL CAMPUS I WAS LAST YEAR. FORTY YEARS AGO. I WAS STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT AT SAN DIEGO STATE AND AS A PART OF THE CSSA WE- WOULD ROTATE THE CAMPUSES AND- HAD MANY OCCASIONS TO COME HERE AT THIS BEAUTIFUL CAMPUS. I SEE SOME CHANGES I SEE SOME THINGS THAT. STILL SEEM THE SAME. THAT COW IS STILL THERE I KNOW THAT COUNTS. BUT THE HEARING ON STUDENT SUCCESS IS PART OF OUR TWO YEAR STATEWIDE TOUR OF COLLEGE CAMPUSES. EXPLORING STUDENT NEEDS AND THEIR ABILITY TO SUCCEED IN THE CLASSROOM.

AND SENATOR RICHARD ROTH WE'RE GONNA GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAY SOME THINGS HERE IN A FEW MINUTES THEY'D LIKE. THE MISSION OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON STUDENT SUCCESS. IS TO GATHER EXPERTS FOR DISCUSSION. NOT TO PUSH A SPECIFIC AGENDA. BUT DISCUSSION TO LEARN. BEST PRACTICES. AND INNOVATIONS TO IMPROVE STUDENT SUCCESS. OUR FOCUS IS ON STUDENTS AND PUTTING THEM ON A PATH. TO A SUCCESSFUL GRADUATION. AT THIS HEARING WE INTEND TO EXPLORE A GROWING CRISIS FACING STUDENTS. AS THEY JUGGLE CLASSROOM CHALLENGES. AND THEIR ABILITY TO GRADUATE ON TIME. AND FOR ME THAT'S FOUR YEARS. BUT TO DO SO WITH MANY OTHER ISSUES IN THEIR WORLD THAT MAYBE WEREN'T AROUND WHEN AS MUCH WHEN I WAS A STUDENT THAT'S ISSUES OF HUNGER. ISSUES OF MENTAL HEALTH. ISSUES OF HOMELESSNESS. STUDENTS WHO STRUGGLE WITH BASIC NEEDS ARE MORE LIKELY TO STRUGGLE WITH THAT. GOAL OF GRADUATION COMPARED TO THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE THE SAME ISSUES. AND EVEN STUDENTS WHO DON'T FACE HEALTH AND HOUSING AND BASIC NEED ISSUES. OFTEN ARE STILL MET WITH OBSTACLES TO GRADUATION. TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO GET THE COURSES THAT THEY NEED TO GRADUATE ON TIME. WE ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM THAT. THE EXPERTS AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM AS TERMS OF HOW WE ARE DOING ON GRADUATION RATES THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE SYSTEM. AND THE SUPPORT AND SUCCESS OF THE CAL PROMISE PROGRAM WE PASSING LEGISLATION IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. AND WE DO SEE A LOT OF DIFFERENCES AMONG CAMPUSES. AND I LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THOSE THAT ARE DOING A PARTICULARLY GOOD JOB AND THAT'S SACRAMENTO STATE AND SAN JOSE STATE THEY HAVE THOUSANDS OF THEIR KIDS INVOLVED IN THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE PHOENICIAN FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT NAMES FOR IT.

OUR FACULTY STAFF AND STUDENTS WHO WERE IN ATTENDANCE AT THE HEARING. AS WELL AS THOSE JOINING US VIA THE LIVESTREAM. IT IS A PRIVILEGE TO TALK TODAY ABOUT THE PROGRESS BEING MADE ACCOUNT HOLLY POMONA AND OUR COMPREHENSIVE AND COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TO STUDENT SUCCESS. CAMPAGNA MONA IS A CAMPUS ON THE MOVE. JEFF SENSE TWENTY CAN I'M ROWLAND HAS GROWN BY MORE THAN A QUARTER WHICH MEANS THAT NEARLY SIX THOUSAND ADDITIONAL STUDENTS ARE BENEFITING FROM A WORLD CLASS KALPANA MONNING EDUCATION TODAY COMPARED TO A DECADE AGO. AND DURING THAT SAME TIME PERIOD THE NUMBER OF INCOMING TRANSFER STUDENTS ARE ROLLING EACH YEAR HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED. NOTABLY OUR INCOMING CLASS OF SEVEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED STUDENTS THIS FALL WAS ROUGHLY HALF FIRST TIME FRESHMEN AND HALF TRANSFER STUDENTS. THIS COMMITMENT TO ACCESS COMBINED WITH OUR INCLUSIVE POLYTECHNIC EDUCATION IS UNIQUELY PREPARING STUDENTS FOR SUCCESS LONG AFTER THEY LEAVE OUR CAMPUS. CONSIDER THE VARIOUS RANKINGS MEASURING SOCIAL MOBILITY WHETHER IT'S IN THE US NEWS ANALYSIS THE SOCIAL MOBILITY INDEX OR THE RESEARCH TEAM AT HARVARD. CAL POLY POMONA RANKS IN THE TOP TEN IN HE- A TESTAMENT TO OUR HARD WORKING STUDENTS AND THE LEARNING THAT TAKES PLACE ON OUR CAMPUS. WE HAVE A GUIDING PRINCIPLE ACCOUNTTYPE MONA THAT SAYS ONE TEAM ONE GOAL STUDENT SUCCESS AND THE TESTIMONY TODAY YOU WILL HEAR THIS PHRASE REPEATED. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY YOU WILL SEE HOW IT MANIFEST IN OUR PROGRAMS AND OUR PROJECTS. THROUGHOUT THE PANEL COMMENTS TODAY WE WERE REFERRED TO THE COMPONENTS OF OUR INTEGRATED MODEL OF STUDENT SUCCESS AND YOU WILL SEE THAT LINE. ON THE SCREEN BUT I THINK YOU ALSO HAVE IT AVAILABLE IN YOUR PACKAGE. AS AN ACTION STAFF OF OUR ACADEMIC MASTER PLAN WE CREATED THIS MODEL TO CONCEPTUALIZE OUR WHOLE LISTING APPROACH TO STUDENT LEARNING ENGAGEMENT AND GROWTH. EACH PIECE OF THE OUTER RAIN DESCRIBES AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF STUDENT SUCCESS WHEN TAKEN TOGETHER THEY PUT OUR STUDENTS ON A GUIDED PATHWAY TO SUCCESS AT CAL POLY POMONA AND BEYOND. BY INVESTING IN THE TOTAL STUDENT WE CONNECT OUR ACADEMIC MASTER PLAN TO OUR OVERARCHING GOAL OF STUDENT SUCCESS. WHEN THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WAS LAUNCHED WE SAW AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE MORE INTENTIONAL AND COMPREHENSIVE IN OUR WORK UTILIZING THE RESOURCE IS CONNECTED TO THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE WE HAVE FOCUSED ON ELIMINATING SILOS INCREASING COLLABORATION STRENGTHENING OUR DATA ANALYTICS CAPABILITIES AND REMOVING BARRIERS TO STUDENT SUCCESS. AND WE ARE INVESTING IN INNOVATION WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON MOST PRESSING NEEDS SUCH AS ADDING CLASS SECTIONS BOWSTRING ADVISING AND STRENGTHENING OUR BASIC NEEDS CAPACITY. FOR EXAMPLE A CENTRAL PIECE OF OUR STUDENT SUCCESS AFTERWARDS WE HAVE EMBARKED ON A FACULTY HIRING PLANS. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WE CONDUCTED FORTY FIVE TENURE TRACK SEARCHES AND LAST YEAR WE CONDUCTED FIFTY ONE FIFTY HAVE BEEN APPROVED FOR THIS YEAR SIMILARLY WE'RE COMMITTED TO RETURNING TO PRE RECESSION TEN YEAR DENSITY LEVELS. THE PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT FROM MY COLLEAGUES ON THE PANEL TODAY REPRESENT JUST A PORTION OF OUR EFFORTS TO PROMOTE STUDENT SUCCESS AND WELL BEING. WHAT IS REPRESENTATIVE EXAMPLES THESE ENDEAVORS TO DEMONSTRATE OUR COMMITMENT TO DATA DRIVEN DECISION MAKING OUR FOCUS ON INNOVATION OUR STEADFASTNESS AND CAREFULLY MEASURING OUR PROGRESS AND OUR COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TO CONSIDERING THE NEEDS OF THE WHOLE STUDENT. AND EVEN AS WE CELEBRATE OUR PROGRESS WE ARE MINDFUL OF THE SERIOUS CHALLENGES WE FACE. I REGRET THE NUMBER C. ISSUE ALLEN JOEL STUDENTS THAT GOT TURN THAT WERE TURNED AWAY FROM OUR CAMPUS THIS FALL WE DENY JUST OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND C. ISSUE ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS. IN TERMS OF AFFORDABILITY THREE FOURTHS OF OUR STUDENTS QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL AID BUT THE AVERAGE AWARD IS ONLY ABOUT HALF THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE WE ARE PROUD OF OUR RECENT PROGRESS IN GRADUATION RATES BUT ARE ALSO AWARE. THAT WE BENEFITED FROM THE MOTIVATING FORCE OF OUR CONVERSION FROM QUARTERS TWO SEMESTERS WHICH BECAME OFFICIAL. IN FALL OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND WHILE WE'RE ON PACE TO REACH OUR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE GOALS OUR OBJECTIVE FOR OUT FOR YOUR GRADUATION RATE IS COMPLICATED BY THE NUMBER OF PROGRAMS ON OUR CAMPUS PARTICULARLY IN ENGINEERING THAT REQUIRE FIVE YEARS OF STUDY BY DESIGN. THESE CHALLENGES ARE SERIOUS BUT AS YOU WILL HEAR FROM OUR PANELISTS TODAY WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A FIRM FOUNDATION FOCUSED ON STUDENT SUCCESS AND BASIC NEEDS THAT UNDERLINED THE ENTIRE C. ISSUES SYSTEMS FOCUS ON THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND THAT FOCUS WILL PROPEL US TO OUR GOALS THANK YOU AGAIN FOR BEING HERE CALIFORNICA MONA AND THE SUPPORTING THE C. ISSUES SYSTEM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARTICLE IN FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND YOUR GRACIOUS WELCOME TO US HERE ON THE CAMPUS TO LOOK FOR TO TALKING WITH YOUR STAFF THROUGHOUT THE MORNING HERE NINE DIGGING DOWN A LITTLE BIT MORE EACH OF THESE AREAS WE APPRECIATE ALL THE GREAT PROGRESS YOU'RE MAKING HERE.

FROM UCLA BECAUSE THAT WAS A BREAK DOWN THERE. THIS IS THE LA BREAKDOWN. IT'S OKAY WE WE'VE WE THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. AND WE LOOK FOR IS YOUR TESTIMONY. GOOD MORNING CENTERS GLAZER CENTER CHANG AND SENATOR ROTH AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE SOME OF OUR STUDENTS SUCCESS STRATEGIES TODAY THIS MORNING. AT CAL POLY POMONA WE BELIEVE IN THE SHARED INSTITUTIONAL AND CROSS DIVISIONAL GOAL OF STUDENT SUCCESS IN OUR AS OUR PRESIDENT MENTIONED. WE REFERRED TO IT AS ONE TEAM ONE GOAL STUDENT SUCCESS. WE'VE DEVELOPED A COMPREHENSIVE AND INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK FOR STUDENT SUCCESS WHICH ALIGNS BOTH WITH THIS YES YOU GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND OUR CAMPUS STRATEGIC PLAN TO PROVIDE A HOLISTIC SUPPORT FOR OUR STUDENTS. THE INTEGRATED MODEL WHICH AS THE PRESIDENT MENTIONED YOU HAVE IN YOUR PACKET AND ALSO SHOWN ON THE SCREENS. REFLECTS OUR UNIQUE INCLUSIVE POLYTECHNIC APPROACH. I'D LIKE TO BRIEFLY HIGHLIGHT ONLY A FEW TARGETED STUDENT SUCCESS REFUGEES THAT REFLECT THIS AND A GREAT APPROACH. FIRST IS DATA INFORMED HOLISTIC ADVISING WE'VE TAKEN SIGNIFICANT STEPS TO REPOSITION RESOURCES REINVESTING ADVISING A JOSH PROCESS SEASON POLICIES AND USE TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE A MORE DATA SUPPORTED. INTEGRATED AND HOLISTIC SUPPORT. HOLISTIC STUDENT ADVISING EXPERIENCE WITH G. I. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE FINDING WE HIRED NINE NEW ADVISERS EIGHT RETENTION AND GRADUATION SPECIALIST ONE IN EACH ACADEMIC COLLEGE. AND A CENTRALIZED THE ADVISING COORDINATOR TO COORDINATE WITH CAMPUS PARTNERS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN EARLY ALERT AND PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS SYSTEM. THIS NEW ADVISING TECHNOLOGY WHICH WE CALL C. PP CONTACT. PROVIDES ADVISORS. WITH ACTIONABLE DATA TO BETTER SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS IN JUST EIGHT SHORT MONTHS WE'VE HAD OVER ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR ADVISORS AND TUTORS UTILIZING THIS NEW ADVISING PLATFORM STUDENTS HAVE SCHEDULED OVER THIRTY SIX THOUSAND ADVISING APPOINTMENTS. AND OVER NINETY FOUR HUNDRED TUTORING SESSIONS THROUGH THESE INVESTMENTS WOULD DECREASE THEIR ADVISER TO STUDENT RATIO FROM ONE ADVISER FOR EVERY. ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR STUDENTS WHICH IS QUITE HIGH. TWO ONE FOR EVERY NINE HUNDRED AND- EIGHTY SEVEN STUDENTS WITH CONTINUED FUNDING THE CAMPUS IS WORKING TO REDUCE THE STUDENT TO ADVISOR RATIO TO THE RECOMMENDED NATIONAL STANDARD OF ONE FOR EVERY FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS. WE RECOGNIZE THAT REDUCTIONS IN ADVISER LOADS MEAN MORE SUSTAINED AND PERSONAL ATTENTION FOR STUDENTS LEADING TO HIGHER RETENTION RATES PARTICULARLY IN THE STUDENTS FIRST TWO YEARS. NEXT I'LL TALK ABOUT FINANCIAL WELL BEING. WHILE MY COLLEAGUE WILL ADDRESS THE BROAD SPECTRUM OF STUDENT WELLBEING I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THE IMPORTANCE OF ALSO ADDRESSING FINANCIAL WELLNESS 74% OF OUR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS RECEIVE SOME FORM OF FINANCIAL AID. TO BETTER SERVE THEM WITH DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED A FINANCIAL WELLNESS PROGRAM THAT TARGETS DIFFERENT STUDENT POPULATIONS DURING DIFFERENT STAGES OF THEIR ACADEMIC JOURNEY WITH APPROPRIATE FINANCIAL LITERACY INFORMATION CAP HOLLY RAMONA HAS PARTNERED WITH I CRACKED. TO BRING STUDENTS AND PARENTS OF FINANCIAL LITERACY AND WELLNESS PLATFORM I GRAD IS AN ENGAGING AND INTERACTIVE TOOL THAT HELPS STUDENTS LEARN ABOUT FINANCIAL WELLNESS AND PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION ON AN ARRAY OF PERSONAL FINANCE TOPICS. NEXT I'LL TALK ABOUT CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROMISE PLEDGE PROGRAMS KAPALI POMONA WAS A PIONEER IN THE CSU AS ONE OF THE FIRST CAMPUSES TO LAUNCH A GRADUATION PLEDGE PROGRAM WHICH PREDATES THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE PLEDGE PROGRAM. AT THE PINNACLE OF KAPALI POMONA'S PLEDGE PROGRAM WE SERVED OVER ONE THOUSAND STUDENTS. OUR EXPERIENCE WITH OUR HOMEGROWN PLEDGE INITIATIVE HAS SET A GOOD FOUNDATION TO FULLY IMPLEMENT CALIFORNIA PROMISE. IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN WE BEGAN A PHASED IMPLEMENTATION OF CALIFORNIA PROMISE WITH TWO ACADEMIC PROGRAMS FOR FIRST TIME FRESHMEN AND ALL ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER OR AT T. PROGRAMS FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE OPEN CALIFORNIA PROMISE TO SEVERAL MORE MAJORS FOR FIRST TIME FRESHMEN. THIS YEAR WE'VE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ALL MAJORS FOR FIRST TIME FRESHMEN EXCEPT FOR ARCHITECTURE WHICH BY DESIGN IS A FIVE YEAR PROGRAM. THIS YEAR WE'VE HAD OVER THREE HUNDRED STUDENTS HAVE COMPLETED ALL OF THE NECESSARY STEPS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM WHICH INCLUDES ENROLLING IN FIFTEEN UNITS AND THEIR FIRST TERM TO REACH THEIR THIRTY UNITS BY THE END OF THE SUMMER. AND MEETING WITH AN ADVISER TO DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED ACTOR THE ACADEMIC PLAN. GIVEN THAT THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON SERVING FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS STUDENTS FROM SCHOOLS WITH LOW COLLEGE ATTENDANCE RATES. AND FROM SCHOOLS THAT SERVE MANY LOW INCOME STUDENTS WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT OUR OUTREACH STRATEGIES ARE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF THE STUDENTS. AND THAT WE DO OUR BEST TO ENSURE THAT WE UTILIZE INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES TO ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CALIFORNIA PROMISE. OUR GOAL IS TO CONTINUE INCREASING NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIA PROMISED STUDENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. NEXT I'LL TALK ABOUT THE AVERAGING AT LOW THAT THE STUDENTS STEAK AND OUR TAKE THIRTY CAMPAIGN INITIATIVE. IN ORDER TO STAY ON TRACK FOR FRESHMEN FOR YOUR GRADUATION AND TRANSFER TO YOUR GRADUATION STUDENTS NEED TO TAKE AN AVERAGE OF FIFTY UNITS OF TERM. I KAPALI POMONA WE LAUNCHED A TAKE THIRTY CAMPAIGN. AN EFFORT WHICH IS YIELDING VERY PROMISING RESULTS IN THE FALL OF TWENTY SIXTEEN TERM WHEN WE WERE STILL ON THE QUARTER CALENDAR. ONLY 22% OF INCOMING FRESHMEN STUDENTS ENROLLED IN FIFTEEN OR MORE UNITS. SO ARE TAKE THIRTY CAMPAIGN WE'VE SEEN A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF INCOMING FRESHMEN STUDENTS AND ROLLED IN FIFTEEN OR MORE UNITS WILL FALL TWENTY NINETEEN TURN. TO AN ALL TIME HIGH OF 61% NEXT I'LL TALK ABOUT STUDENT ENGAGEMENT SUPPORTED AND ENHANCED BY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OR A I. I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT OUR EFFORTS TO ENGAGE WITH NEW STUDENTS USING AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CHAT BOT. WHICH MEETS STUDENTS WHERE THEY ARE WHICH IS ON THE PHONES. WE CALL THIS TOOL DAILY CHAT. BILL RICHARD IS OUR HEY I TEXT MESSAGING ROBOT AVAILABLE TO INCOMING FRESHMEN AND TRANSFER STUDENTS STUDENTS CAN TEXT BILLY QUESTIONS AND GET ANSWERS TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. WHEN BILLY CANNOT PROVIDE AN APPROPRIATE ANSWER A STAFF MEMBER STEPS IN TO NOT ONLY ANSWER THE MORE DIFFICULT QUESTIONS BUT ALSO A DESIGN SAME TIME TO ADD TO BILL IS. GROWING KNOWLEDGE BASE. WE ALSO USE BILLY CHAT TO COMMUNICATE WITH STUDENTS WHO NEED NOTCHES TO ENROLL IN THE UNIVERSITY SUCCESSFULLY. THESE NOT JUST HAVE INCLUDED REMIND STUDENTS ABOUT THE EARLY START REQUIREMENT. REGISTERING FOR INTONATION AND TRANSCRIPTS OF MISSION. WE INITIALLY COMMUNICATED WITH EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED NEW STUDENTS BILLY CENTS OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND MESSAGES AND HAS RECEIVED NEARLY EIGHTY THOUSAND WITHIN THE FIRST COUPLE OF MONTHS THIS IS AN IMMEDIATE SAVINGS OF NEARLY ONE THOUSAND AND THREE HUNDRED STAFF HOURS. WHO IN TURN CAN DIRECTOR FOCUS ON HI TOUCH ADVISING CASES. WHERE CAMPUS WITH A HIGH NUMBER OF FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS AND BAILEY IS CRITICAL IN HELPING THE STUDENTS TRANSITION INTO UNIVERSITY LIFE. NEXT I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT ELIMINATE BARRIERS TO GRADUATION. TO ASSIST STUDENTS AT THE END OF THE ACADEMIC JOURNEY KAPALI POMONA LAUNCHED A SUMMER COMPLETION INITIATIVE AND I MIGHT ADD USING PRIVATE FOUNDATION DOLLARS TO ASSIST STUDENTS WITH COMPLETING THEIR DEGREE DURING THE SUMMER TERM INSTEAD OF WAITING UNTIL THE FALL TERM. IN SUMMER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN CAL POLY POMONA OFFERS SUMMER COMPLETION GRANTS TO STUDENTS WHO WERE LESS THAN EIGHT UNITS 2 DEGREES. THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN STUDENTS OR WERE GIVEN THE GRANTS AND 93% WHICH IS A VERY HIGH SUCCESS RATE 93% COMPLETED THE DEGREE DURING THAT SUMMER. FROM THE STUDENTS PERSPECTIVE THIS IS AN IMMEDIATE SAVINGS OF NEARLY THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND A LONGER TERM SAVINGS OF NEARLY THIRTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS. THIS EFFORT SUPPORTED OUR DIVERSE STUDENT POPULATION REGARDLESS OF FINANCIAL NEED. ARE THE STUDENTS WHO COMPLETED THE DE QUEEN IN THE SUMMER OF UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY STUDENTS AND 62% WERE FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS. WE RECENTLY COMPLETED YOUR TWO OF THE SUMMER COMPLETION INITIATIVE AND ARE WAITING FOR THE FINAL GRADUATION RESULTS TO COME IN. FINALLY I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE PROGRESS. THE STRATEGIES IS HIGHLIGHTED ARE BUT A FEW OF OUR INSTITUTIONAL EFFORTS TO IMPROVE RETENTION INCREASE GRADUATION RATES FOR BOTH FRESHMAN AND TRANSFERS AND CLOSE EQUITY GAPS. THE C. AS YOUR GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE PROVIDES US WITH CLEAR METRICS AND SYSTEM SUPPORT TO ACHIEVE THESE AMBITIOUS GOALS. OUR CAMPUS HAS MADE STEADY PROGRESS IN BOTH INCREASING FRESHMAN ENTRANCE GRADUATION RATES AND DECREASING EQUITY GAPS. AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE HAND OUT TABLE THAT IS PROVIDED TO YOU AND ALSO CAN BE SEEN ON THE SCREENS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE WERE ONE OF ONLY TWO CAMPUSES AMONG THE TWENTY THREE CSU CAMPUSES. TO MAKE PROGRESS ON ALL SIX METRICS. CONTINUED SUPPORT FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND THE SYSTEM WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN REACH OUR GOALS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTORATE IT'S A GREAT GREAT PRESENTATION AND- YOU KNOW WHEN I LOOKED AROUND THE- THE C. S. U. FOR EXAMPLES OF GREAT LEADERSHIP IN THE AREA OF GRADUATION RATES. IT WAS ONE OF TWO CAMPUSES THAT I FOCUSED ON BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT YOU DID AND YOU CALL THAT YOU WERE A PIONEER AND IT WAS TRUE. THAT SIDE YOUR GRADUATION PLEDGE THAT YOU BEGAN ON OFFER THAT'S TWO THOUSAND. NINETEEN NINETY NINE NINETEEN NINETY NINE YEAH. AND IT WAS IT WAS BOTH OF POMONA SANDRA DINO WITH THE TWO LEADERS ON THIS. AND PART OF CREATING THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM WAS TO USE YOUR CAMPUSES GREAT LEADERSHIP AND SUCCESS AND PUTTING THAT LEGISLATION FORWARD. AND I THINK AS YOU MENTIONED AT THAT AT ONE TIME HE HAD A THOUSAND KIDS IN THAT PROGRAM. AND I GUESS THE THING THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT SURPRISED ME ABOUT POMONA ONE IS THAT. IS THAT THE GOALS PRETTY LOW. I KNOW YOU'VE MADE GREAT PROGRESS BUT IF YOU LOOK AT IT FROM A STATEWIDE BASIS. OTHER MODEST IN AND OUT WHAT YOU WANT TO ACCOMPLISH I THINK GIVEN THE PROGRESS YOU'VE MADE SO FAR WHICH HAS BEEN TREMENDOUS PSYCH. THE CEILINGS THAT YOU HAD A STEREO THAT THE GOALS THAT YOU ESTABLISH TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. I'M HOPING YOU GUYS BLOW THROUGH THAT. BY FAR I REALLY THINK YOU CAN. AND I HOPE THAT IT MAYBE ALLOWS YOU TO DO A RE ASSESSMENT OF WHAT YOUR POTENTIAL REALLY IS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S MUCH GREATER THAN A- 38% FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE. PROFESSIONAL I. IS EVEN THOSE NUMBERS. THE UNFORTUNATE PART THERE'S GROWTH AND THEN THERE'S THE NUMBERS. AND MAYBE YOU CAN SPEAK TO. NO. ANP TALK ABOUT BEING DATA DRIVEN. THOUSANDS OF KIDS ARE STILL DROPPING OUT OF THIS UNIVERSITY AND MANY OTHERS AROUND THE STATE. DO YOU DO ANY KIND OF SYSTEMATIC SURVEY OF THOSE STUDENTS TO FIND OUT WHY. WE HAVE THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION WE HAVE A LOT OF STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS OUR RETENTION RATES. WE HAVE WERE USING DATA ANALYTICS TO UNDERSTAND WHY STUDENTS AREN'T RETURNING SO FOR EXAMPLE. AS AN EXAMPLE OF AND GETTING READY FOR THE SPRING TERM. WE HAVE DATA THAT WE CAN SEE WHO WERE THE STUDENTS WHO WERE HERE IN THE FALL BUT HAVE NOT YET ENROLLED FOR THE SPRING TERM. WE HAVE TARGETED STRATEGIES TO TARGET THOSE STUDENTS TO UNDERSTAND WHY THEY ARE NOT RETURNING WHAT IS THE REASON IS IT IS IT A FINANCIAL REASON OR DO OTHER REASONS. AS FAR AS A SERVICE SURVEY I CAN. DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUES TO DO SPECIFICALLY SPEAK OF SURVEYS. ANYBODY HAVE ANY INSIGHT ABOUT DAY ACTUALLY TALKING TO STUDENTS WHO HAVE DRAWN DOWN. LET ME JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT ATKINS I APPRECIATE IN YOUR METRICS HERE WE TALK ABOUT DATA DRIVEN DECISION MAKING. AND THERE'S LOTS OF WAYS TO APPLY THAT BOTH INTO MAKING CLASSES AVAILABLE IF STUDENTS WANT TO TAKE. IT'S ALSO TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE BARRIERS ARE THAT MADE THEM SAY THEY THEY COULD CONTINUE CERTAINLY FINANCIAL ISSUES WILL ALWAYS BE IN PLAY. BUT WE HEAR A LOT FROM STUDENTS TO THAT THEY COULDN'T GET THEIR CLASSES THEY COULDN'T GET THERE WAS THERE WAS A PREREQUISITE REQUIRED AND IT WASN'T AVAILABLE. NOW IS GONNA SET THEM BACK FOR A SEMESTER OR YEAR WITH AT GREAT COST AND EXPENSE. I THINK WE WOULD BENEFIT FROM TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. THAT STARTLING NUMBER THAT WE DON'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT MUCH BUT IT'S TRUE. IT'S NOT JUST HUNDREDS IT'S TENS OF THOUSANDS EVERY YEAR STATEWIDE DROPOUT. AND IT BE GOOD FOR IF WE HAD THE DATA TO CAN UNDERSTAND THAT. I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE AND- GREAT PHRASE HERE TAKE THIRTY CAMPAIGN AND THAT THE NUMBERS THAT YOU HAVE MOVED ON FRESHMAN IS X. EXTRAORDINARY. EXTRAORDINARY AND I'D LOVE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT ADVERTISING THAT WENT INTO THAT THE PROMOTION OF THAT BECAUSE WHAT WHAT'S STUNNING NUMBERS. THAT YOU SHARED WITH US. TODAY GOING FROM 22% FRESHMAN TAKING. 3261% THAT'S INCREDIBLE. THE IF I MAY SENATOR IF WITH RESPECT TO THE CLASS SCHEDULE WE USE BOTH DATA ANALYTICS AND ALSO INFORMATION FROM ADVISERS TO STUDENTS SENATE DEPARTMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE CLASSES THAT THE STUDENTS NEED ARE OFFERED IN THE CLASS SCHEDULE WE HAVE. WORKED VERY HARD WITH ALL OF OUR DEPARTMENTS AND COLLEGES TO INSURE THAT WE EXPANDED THE TIMES THAT THE CLASSES ARE OFFERED FROM EARLY IN THE MORNING TO LATE IN THE EVENING. EVEN ON THE WEEKENDS SO WE HAVE MORE CLASSES EARLIER IN THE MORNING WE HAVE MORE CLASSES LATER IN THE EVENING SO MORE MORE CLASSES. ON THE WEEKENDS. TO ADDRESS THAT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. OUR AS I. HAS JUST INITIATED A PROGRAM TO. TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF NON NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS AS WELL SO WE WILL PARTNER WITH THEM TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THOSE NEEDS FOR CLASS. NOT A GREAT ANYWAYS I CERTAINLY HERE THAT I HEARD THIS MORNING. AND BY MEETING. WITH SOME OF THE STUDENT LEADERS AND LET ME JUST TODAY. FINISH UP WITH THE- ONE MORE OBSERVATION AND THEN ASK A QUESTION. IN THE SUMMER COMPLETION INITIATIVE IS SOMETHING THAT I KNOW THAT WE HAVE BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO. TO FIND AND TO HELP YOU MENTION YOU GOT PRIVATE MONEY TO DO THAT SO THAT'S A DOUBLE PRAISE FOR. THAT ACCOMPLISHMENT I THINK THAT. MANY OF US WITH LOOK FOR WAYS TO TRY TO SUPPORT THE SUMMER INITIATIVES WITH FUNDING FROM THE STATE. AND I HOPE WE CAN CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION FIGURE OUT A WAY TO DO THAT BECAUSE- TO TAKE THOSE THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN STUDENTS THERE WERE EIGHT UNITS AWAY FROM A DEGREE AND WE KNOW THE DIFFERENCE WITH NO DEGREE DEGREE IT'S A MASSIVE DIFFERENCE ECONOMICALLY. AND TO BE ABLE TO GET THEM OVER THE TOP WITH THAT SUMMER PROGRAM IS INCREDIBLY. VALUABLE FOR THEM AND FOR THE STATE AND I'D CERTAINLY LIKE TO FIND A WAY TO SUPPORT THE EFFORTS WITH PUBLIC DOLLARS NOT JUST YOUR SUCCESS IN RAISING. A PRIVATE DOLLARS BUT MY POINT FINAL QUESTION AND MAYBE THIS WILL CONTINUE. WITH OTHER FOLKS THAT ARE GOING TO TESTIFY. IS SHE IS IT IS THE ISSUE OF THE PROMISE PROGRAM THE COMMITMENT THE PLEDGE. IT'S ONE THING TO SEE AN ENCOURAGING AND ENCOURAGE MORE UNITS TO BE TAKEN. IT'S ANOTHER THING TO HAVE A COMMITMENT BETWEEN THE INSTITUTION A STUDENT THAT SAYS IF A STUDENT WANTS TO GET THROUGH IN FOUR YEARS AND MAINTAINS A C. AVERAGE OR C. PLUS AVERAGE. AND TAKES THIRTY UNITS THAT WE'RE GONNA GUARANTEE THAT THEY CAN DO IT. AND THAT'S THE ESSENCE OF THE PROMISE PROGRAM IS A PLEDGE FROM BOTH SIDES. AND IT IT DE IT DOES CREATE PRESSURES ON THE INSTITUTION. AND I KNOW THAT IT'S SACKS STATED AT SAN JOSE STATE WHEN THOSE G. THE UNIVERSITY LEADERSHIP AGREED TO PROMOTE THAT PROMISE PROGRAM AND SAID THE KIDS YOU WANNA GET OUT IN FOUR YEARS. YOU MAKE THESE COMMITMENTS WE MAKE THESE AND WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT TO A TOGETHER THAT'S IT THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE POWERFUL PARTNERSHIP. GOING FORWARD AND I I'M SURPRISED THAT THAT. THAT HE WOULD POMONA TAKES AN X. SIX OR SEVEN MOUSE CLICKS. ON IT. ON YOUR WEBSITE TO FIND ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR PHOENICIAN FOR YOUR CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM. ACTUAL SCREEN SHOTS I'M GOING TO THE POMONA WEBSITE TRY TO FIND INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROGRAM AND WE CAN REVIEW THAT. BUT I'M I'M JUST WONDERING WHY YOU'RE NOT PUTTING UP A STRONGER EFFORT INTO INTO AT THE PROMISE PROGRAM GETTING THE STUDENTS TO COMMIT TO IT AND HAVING YOU MAKE A SIMILAR COMMITMENT THAT THE NUMBERS OF THREE HUNDRED. EVEN YOUR HISTORICAL NUMBERS WE HAD A THOUSAND IN IT TEN YEARS AGO. TO SEE IT SOLO WAS SURPRISING TO ME. THANK YOU SENATOR THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO THIS QUESTION. I I'D LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT ABSOLUTELY WHEN WE NEED TO DO A LOT BETTER OUR WE ARE IMPLEMENTED CALIFORNIA PROMISED LAST YEAR WE STARTED. WITH A SMALL NUMBER THIS YEAR WE'VE GROWN TO PROGRAM QUITE A BIT WE HAVE. JUST ABOUT DOWN THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY STUDENTS AT THE MOMENT ABOUT TWO THIRDS ARE FIRST TIME FRESHMEN ABOUT ONE THIRD I TRANSFER STUDENTS. WE RECOGNIZE WE NEED TO HAVE A MUCH GREATER COMMITMENT TO RECRUITING THE STUDENTS FOR ON CALIFORNIA PROMISE MAKING SHORT AT. THE MOMENT THEY COMMIT TO COMING TO KAPALI POMONA. THAT WE REACH OUT AND WE ENJOYED THAT. THAT THE THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN THE PROGRAM. A SHARP PIPELINES NEED TO BE MUCH STRONGER THOSE FOUR AND COMING FIRST TIME FRESHMEN STUDENTS BUT ALSO TRANSFER STUDENTS. THOSE PIPELINES NEED TO ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO JOIN THE PROGRAM BUT ALSO THE INVITATION THAT THE STUDENTS GET ONCE THEY ARE ON CAMPUS WE NEED TO DO A MUCH BETTER JOB TO IMPROVE THOSE NUMBERS. WE WERE JUST AWARDED A M. APART A TITLE FIVE GRAND AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF THAT WENT TO JUST TO DO PRECISELY THAT TO IMPROVE OUR PIPELINE PROGRAMS. GREAT THAT'S GREAT TO HEAR AND I LOOK FORWARD IT'S A PARTNERSHIP WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. AND WE WANT TO HELP THE HELP YOU TO AND THE FOUR TO WORKING ON THAT. YES ALSO JUST RESPOND AS YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THE PROMISED. LAND IN FACT. THE UNDERLYING PHILOSOPHY AND THE VALUE OF THE PROMISE PROGRAM. FROM CAL POLY POMONA'S PERSPECTIVE IS WHAT ALSO G. I. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IS ABOUT. BECAUSE WE WHILE WE CERTAINLY WILL. CONTINUE TO BE INTENTIONAL BUT THOSE STUDENTS. WHO CAN AND WILL MAKE THAT. DEFINITIVE PLEDGE WHAT WE FOUND AS WE LOOK TO SOME OF THE DATA FOR THE STUDENTS WHO STARTED AND CONTINUE THE PROGRAM. IS IT MORE OFTEN THEY CHANGED MAJORS. THEY ENDED UP DECIDING FOR. OFTEN TIMES FINANCIAL REASONS THAT THEY NEEDED TO BOTH WORK PART TIME AND GO TO SCHOOL. AND SO WHAT THE LIST THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE BUT ALSO. THE BORDER. GRADUATION INITIATIVE THE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. IT HAS ALLOWED THE CAMPUSES TO DEVELOP THE INFRASTRUCTURE. I THINK THAT WHAT WE HAVE HAVE SHOWN. IS THAT THE ABILITY TO TRACK STUDENTS THE ABILITY TO FOLLOW WHAT THE STUDENTS. JUST THE BILLY CHAT. ALONE HAS SHOWN. THAT THE FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVE FROM THE STATE. HAS BEEN THE SENSUAL. TO CREATE AN INSTITUTIONAL CULTURAL SHIFT. AND WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS THE- DEVELOPMENT OF THESE ELEMENTS THAT WE THINK ARE CRITICAL AND THE NEED TO WORK. TOGETHER AND SO WHETHER IT'S THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE WOULD JUST SAID THERE'S REALLY BEEN A FOUNDATION. FOR OUR THINKING HERE AT CAL POLY POMONA ABOUT HOW WE STRUCTURE. THE BROADER NETWORK OF. OF SERVICES AND ACTIVITIES. SO THAT YOU WILL SEE ARE THE. KIND OF PROGRESS. YOU MADE MENTION IN TERMS OF THESE NUMBERS DID THE GOALS THAT WERE SET WE RECOGNIZE TO AND I'M AND AS THE CHANCES OFFICE IS WORKING WITH THE VARIOUS CAMPUSES ALSO LOOKING IF YOU WILL AT. THE ADVISER TO STUDENT RATIO LOOKING OUT WHAT WILL IT HEY. IT THEN ALLOWED US TO STEP BACK AND THINK IN A MUCH MORE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK MANNER AS TO HOW WE WERE GOING TO OPERATIONALIZE AND IMPLEMENT. AND NOW THAT WE HAVE A PATH FORWARD YOU WILL SEE THE CAMPUSES GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT THOSE THOSE EXPECTATIONS ARE AND SO WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE TRAJECTORY THAT WE ON THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR REID JUST ONE COMMENT I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE AND I. THINK YOU PROBABLY AGREE THAT. EFFECTIVE COUNSELING IS FAIRLY KEY TO ATTEND THE GRADUATION. SO AS WE MOVE INTO THE NEXT BUDGET CYCLE WHAT I HOPE AND TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO I HOPE FOR LISTENING TO THIS. THE FROM AN INSTITUTIONAL STANDPOINT WE SEE SOME NUMBER APPEAR THAT TO TELLS US WHAT EXACTLY WE NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO FUND. TO GET YOU FROM ONE TO NINE HUNDRED OR ONE TO A THOUSAND DOWN ON CLOSER TO ONE TO FIVE HUNDRED. BECAUSE I THINK EFFECTIVE COUNSELING. TALKING TO STUDENTS ABOUT WHAT THEY NEED TO TAKE WHAT THEY SHOULDN'T WASTE THEIR TIME TAKING WILL HELP US MOVE PEOPLE THROUGH THE PIPELINE A LITTLE FASTER. WITH THE KIND OF DEGREE THAT'S GOING TO PRODUCE A GOOD. GOOD PAYING JOB CUSTOMER SATISFACTION INSTITUTIONAL SATISFACTION IT'S A WIN WIN FOR EVERYBODY SO I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT NUMBER WHEN WE START THE BUDGET PROCESS THIS NEXT YEAR THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU SENATOR AND I ALSO WOULD JUST JUST LIKE TO ADD THAT. WHAT WE'VE ALSO RECOGNIZE AND THEN THE BEAUTY. OF THE GRADUATION NISH IT HAS BEEN THAT THE CAMPUSES. I'VE BEEN ALLOWED TO INDIVIDUALIZE THEIR NEEDS BECAUSE FOR SOME CAMPUSES THAT. THAT COUNSELOR RATIO IS LOWER FOR KAPLAN MONNING GETS HIGHER AND SO WHAT THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE HAS REALLY. IN COVERAGE IS RATHER THAN A COOKIE CUTTER APPROACH TO THE WAY WE WOULD. MEET OUR GOALS AND MAKE SURE THAT OUR STUDENTS SUCCEED IS IT THE CAMPUSES ARE ABLE TO PUT THE DOLLARS BASED ON FORD THERE IS THE GREATEST NEED AND SO YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. ACCOUNT POLY POMONA IT WAS LOOKING AT ADVISORS AND CHANGING THAT RATIO FOR ANOTHER CAMPUS. THAT ADVISING SYSTEM IS ALREADY BEEN IN PLACE AND SO THEIR DOLLARS ARE GOING TO GO TO AREAS THAT THEY HAVE THAT OUR GREATEST NEED SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE. THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE SUPPORT FOR THE GRADUATION ISSUE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WELL WE OBVIOUSLY NEED TO GET YOU MORE MONEY WELL YOU KNOW. WHAT MONA WILL NEVER TURN DOWN. BUT I THINK I THINK IT YOU KNOW AS WE LOOK AT AND I'M AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW I'M ON THE FUTURE OF WORK COMMISSION AND WHAT WE RECOGNIZE IS THAT IS A C. ISSUE SYSTEM OF FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENTS. AND THE ECONOMY OF CALIFORNIA BEING FUELED BY THE STUDENTS INTO THAT INTO THAT MAINSTREAM THAT THE ENTIRE. TWENTY THREE CAMPUS SYSTEM IS CAN IS NEEDING TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THE WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN MOST APPROPRIATELY. MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR REGION AND OF OUR LOCAL LOCAL AREA SO THIS I THINK AS I'M BUT TALK WITH SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES IN OTHER STATES THIS HAS BEEN. THE MOST INNOVATIVE AND I THINK IMPACTFUL PIECE OF LEGISLATION OF THE SUPPORT OF THE G. I. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IN HIGHER EDUCATION WELL I THINK MAYBE WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS LOOK AT. THE BUDGET BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE BUDGET TO ZERO SUM GAME SO WHICH IS VERY DIFFICULT IT HAS TO BALANCE AND WE DON'T PRINT MONEY. BUT PERHAPS WHAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT IS DIRECTING A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY. AT THE INSTITUTION LITTLE THE BILL WOULD ALLOW THE CHANCELLOR TO FOR COUNSELING PURPOSES THAT WILL ALLOW THE CHANCELLOR TO REDIRECT MONEY. TO THOSE CAMPUSES IN THE ADDITIONAL COUNSELING RESOURCES FOR WHATEVER REASON SO ANYWAY I'M NOT GOING TO BELABOR THIS BUT LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING A CONVERSATION. JANET IT'S A IT'S A GOOD POINT AND I JUST TO CLARIFY YOUR TIME ACADEMIC COUNSELOR WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH SOME OTHER COUNSELING ISSUES INVOLVED ACADEMIC JOBS AND THE PHONE RANG. RIGHT PROS ALTHOUGH I THINK WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT THE OTHER TYPES OF COUNSELING I THINK HOPEFULLY YOU'RE. THE SENATE WILL CONTINUE AND THAT DIRECTION AS WELL. YES SIR. QUICKLY OUR RESPONSE THANK YOU CENTER ROTH FOR ASKING A QUESTION UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT GOALIE AND- PROVOST ALTHOUGH THE CAMPUS HAS ENGAGED IN A MULTI YEAR. ADVISER ON HIRING PLANNED TO DETERMINE WHAT IT TAKES TO BRING THE NUMBERS THE RECOMMENDED NUMBER OF. DODD ONE ADVISER FOR EVERY FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS. WITH THE COST STRUCTURE THAT IS REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL. THANK YOU SOPHIA AND HERE'S A DE DATA POINT. TAKE IT FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH IT'S A COUPLE YEARS OLD BUT WHEN THE C. S. YOU LOOKED AT. ALL THOSE WHO HAD GRADUATED THEY'VE GOT THEIR DEGREE. THE AVERAGE. GRADUATE HAS TAKEN ALMOST FIFTEEN UNITS EXTRA. THAN THEY NEEDED TO GET THEIR DEGREE NOW. PART OF THAT'S THAT TO WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID EARLIER PEOPLE CAN CHANGE MAJORS THAT CAN CHANGE YOUR MIND THEY CAN JUST. C. CLASS THEY WANTED TAKEN. TAKE IT. NOBODY CAN RESTRICT THAT. BUT IT DOES ALSO POTENTIALLY SPEAK TO. THE BENEFITS THAT WOULD COME FROM THAT ENHANCED ACADEMIC ADVISING AND I KNOW THE TOOLS OF WITH THE ADVENT IMPROVED IN TERMS OF. PATHWAYS FOR STUDENTS IN ONLINE AND THEIR RATE REGISTRATION FOR CLASSES AND ALL THE REST TO. SEE WHETHER SOMETHING IS APPLICABLE TO THEIR DEGREE OR NOT AND THEY'RE GONNA MAKE THE CHOICE TO WANNA MAKE BUT AT LEAST THEY- WON'T DO IT THINKING THAT HELP SENATE AND IT REALLY DOESN'T. AND WE HAVE A- A COHORT OF GRADUATES THAT HAVE TAKEN A FULL EXERCER MASTERED THAT'S MORE THAN NECESSARY YOU HAVE TO GO AND EXAMINE THAT AND- AND THAT DATA WILL. HELP FURTHER. ALL RIGHT WITH THAT I WANT TO CONTINUE ON WITH ARE WONDERFUL. EXPERTS THAT WE HAVE HERE DOCTOR LEVINE IS A LIVING AIRLINE. LEVINE I DID GET IT RIGHT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THE DEAN AND PROFESSOR OF MUSIC HERE AT POMONA. AND YOU. SHARE SOME OF YOUR OWN. EXPERTISE OF FACULTY PERSPECTIVE AND OTHERS WE WELCOME YOU AND WE LOOK FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. SO MUCH GOOD MORNING SENATORS I AM IRIS LEVIN THE DEAN OF THE COLLEGE OF LETTERS ARTS AND SOCIAL SCIENCES AS YOU JUST HEARD. AND IT IS MY PLEASURE TO TALK ABOUT HOW OUR COLLEGE PLAYS A ROLE IN THE INTEGRATED MODEL. OF STUDENT SUCCESS THROUGH HOLISTIC ADVISING AND COACHING. OUR COLLEGE PROMOTES HOLISTIC ADVISING FOR STUDENTS AND HIS INITIATE IT INITIATED A PILOT PROGRAM OF COACHING STUDENTS CALLED FIRST CLASS COACHING WITH CLASS BEING THE ACRONYM FOR THE COLLEGE OF LETTERS ARTS AND SOCIAL SCIENCES. WE ARE COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING THE WELL BEING AN EDUCATIONAL ASPIRATIONS FOR OUR STUDENTS FOR WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRULY SHAPE STUDENTS FUTURE IN SUPPORT OF A LIFETIME OF ACHIEVEMENT. OUR FACULTY ARE ENGAGED IN BOTH THE ADVISING AND COACHING MODELS AND WE HAVE A ROBUST FACULTY LED STUDENT SUCCESS COMMITTEE THAT ARE CHAMPIONS FOR OUR COLLEGE INITIATIVES. OUR COLLEGE HOUSES APPROXIMATELY FIFTY EIGHT HUNDRED STUDENTS IN FIFTEEN DIFFERENT PROGRAMS OF STUDY AND 68% OF OUR STUDENTS ARE FROM UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES PRIMARILY LET NECKS AND AFRICAN AMERICAN. OUR ADVISING MODEL IS A HOLISTIC TEAM APPROACH CONSISTING OF STAFF ADVISORS IN OUR STUDENT SUCCESS CENTER. FACULTY ADVISORS IN EACH OF OUR LEVIN DEPARTMENTS OUR FACULTY STUDENT SUCCESS COMMITTEE. OUR PEER MENTORS AND THE TWENTY ONE COACHES INVOLVED IN FIRST CLASS COACHING. IN OUR STUDENT SUCCESS CENTER WE HAVE FOUR STAFF ADVISORS ONE OF WHOM IS A RETENTION AND GRADUATION SPECIALIST. LITTLE CHANGE IN OUR ADVISING PROCESS IS THE MOVE FROM PASSIVE ADVISING WAITING FOR STUDENTS TO COME TO SEE US TO ACTIVE ADVISING SCHEDULING APPOINTMENTS WITH STUDENTS HOLDING WORKSHOPS ON STUDY SKILLS AND STRESS MANAGEMENT. PROVIDING ADVISING CHECKLIST FOR FIRST TIME FRESHMEN CONNECTING STUDENTS WITH OUR CAREER CENTER AND UTILIZING A ROBUST APPROACH TO COMMUNICATING VIA SOCIAL MEDIA AND DIGITAL DISPLAYS THROUGHOUT OUR BUILDINGS. OUR FIRST CLASS COACHING PROGRAM IS A THREE YEAR PILOT PROGRAM IN COLLABORATION WITH STUDENT AFFAIRS. THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES AN ACADEMIC ADVISING COACH TO ALL FIRST TIME FRESHMEN UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITIES AND FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS. THESE COACHES ARE EXISTING STAFF AND FACULTY WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN A COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING OF THIS COACHING METHODOLOGY. THIS TRAINING WAS SUPPORTED BY PRIVATE FUNDING. OUR STAFF COACHES NOW HAVE THESE RESPONSIBILITIES WRITTEN INTO THEIR CURRENT JOB DESCRIPTIONS AND FACULTY COACHES HAVE RECEIVED RELEASE TIME FROM TEACHING TO SUPPORT THEIR EFFORTS IN COACHING. IN YEAR ONE WE HAD FIFTEEN COACHES WORKING WITH OVER FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY STUDENTS. THIS YEAR YEAR TWO WE HAVE TWENTY ONE COACHES WORKING WITH JUST ABOUT THAT SAME NUMBER OF STUDENTS. COACHES HAVE A VARIETY OF TOPICS THAT THEY DISCUSS WITH STUDENTS RANGING FROM ACADEMICS AND CAREER TO KEEPING COMMITMENTS HEALTH FINANCES AND GRADUATION HOPES. YOU CAN SEE THE PERCENTAGES IN THE PIE CHART WHICH IS ON THE SCREEN AND I BELIEVE IN YOUR HANDOUT AS WELL. AS WE ARE NOW IN THE SECOND YEAR OF THIS OF THIS PROGRAM WE HAVE PRELIMINARY DATA ON FALL TO FALL RETENTION RATES OF YOU ARE M. STUDENTS AND FIRST GENERATION STONES IN THIS COACHING PILOT. FROM THIS LAST YEAR AND THE PRELIMINARY RESULTS ARE VERY PROMISING. FOR FIRST YEAR UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITY STUDENTS IN CLASS WE HAD A ONE YEAR INCREASE IN RETENTION OF SIX POINT 5% FOR EIGHTY THREE POINT 2% TO EIGHTY NINE POINT 7% RETENTION. AND FOR FIRST YEAR FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS WE HAD A ONE YEAR INCREASE IN RETENTION OF SIX POINT 8% FROM EIGHTY TWO POINT FOLLOWING YOUR ONE WE ALSO CONDUCTED A SURVEY OF THOSE STUDENTS ENROLLED IN THE FIRST CLASS COACHING PROGRAM. SOME OF THE UNSOLICITED QUOTES FROM STUDENTS ARE ON THIS NEXT SLIDE AND AGAIN IN YOUR HANDOUT. ON ITS FACE IT SEEMS RATHER UNNECESSARY BUT AS YOU MEET WITH YOUR COACH IT'S NICE TO KNOW THAT SOMEONE AT THE UNIVERSITY IS GENUINELY INTERESTED IN YOU AS A PERSON. AND CARES ABOUT YOU DOING WELL IN ALL ASPECTS OF YOUR LIFE. AND FROM ANOTHER STUDENT. THE PROGRAM ALLOWED ME TO HAVE SOMEONE I COULD ALWAYS TALK TO AND MAKE SURE THAT I STAYED ON TRACK FOR MY FUTURE GOALS. IT WAS VERY COOL TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS AND IT WAS DEFINITELY EFFECTIVE. WE ARE VERY PROUD OF OUR EFFORTS WITH RESPECT TO ADVISING AND COACHING. THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT OUR HOLISTIC APPROACH TO ADVISING AND COACHING THANK YOU DOCTOR LIVING WHAT A GREAT STORY THAT YOU HAVE SHARED AND THE- NO I USED TO OUTPLAY I'LL A FEW YEARS AGO ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE I MADE A AN OBSERVATION ABOUT. THE FRUSTRATION OF FIVE STUDENTS IN OUR UNIVERSITIES BEING TREATED LIKE A NUMBER. NOT LIKE A PERSON. AND I HELD UP A PIECE OF FRUIT AND SAID THAT THERE ARE MORE TOUCHES TO THIS PIECE OF FRUIT FROM HARVESTING TO. BE PICKING UP IN A GROCERY STORE MORE TOUCHES BY PEOPLE. A PIECE OF FRUIT IN THERE IS TO STUDENT IN MANY OF OUR UNIVERSITIES. AND YOUR WORK THAT YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL WORK IN TRYING TO. BREAK THROUGH THAT AND CREATE THAT PERSONAL CONNECTION IS INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE. AND IMPORTANCE AND I KNOW WE HAVE REPRESENTS FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE HERE TAKING NOTE ABOUT BEST PRACTICES AND YOU'VE GIVEN A GREAT EXAMPLE OF A- OF A WONDERFUL BEST PRACTICE IN AND CERTAINLY ASKING STAFF AND FACULTY TO DO MORE. AND THAT'S NOT EASY TO DO THEY HAVE A LOT OF APPLICATIONS SO I APPRECIATE THAT THAT REQUIRED THEM TO STEP UP AND- IMPORTANT WAYS NOW HOPE THEY FEEL THAT FILAMENT. AND THE SUCCESS THAT YOU SHARE WITH US TODAY THANK YOU. SENATE ROCK MISTER CHAIR MA'AM I WAS JUST CURIOUS ON THE PIE CHART. UNDER DISCUSSIONS WITH COACHES THERE'S A CATEGORY. OF HEALTH SENATE INDICATES A PERCENT. HOW DOES THAT. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN PROVIDE ANY MORE DETAIL ON THAT PARTICULAR CATEGORY AND I'M CURIOUS AS TO HOW THAT RELATES TO OUR EFFORTS WITH RESPECT TO MENTAL HEALTH CAMPUSES MENTAL HEALTH OF STUDENTS AND OTHER RELATED ISSUES. RIGHT I DON'T I CAN'T TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT THOSE COMMENTS WERE WITH RESPECT TO HEALTH BUT THE USER THESE PERCENTAGES WERE BROUGHT TO US FROM THE STUDENT SURVEYS SO THEY'RE THE ONES WHO REPORTING BACK THAT THEY TALKED WITH THEIR COACHES ABOUT ISSUES OF HEALTH AND WHEN THEY DO OUR COACHES ARE TRAINED TO KNOW WEIRD TO WALK THAT STUDENT OVER TO WHETHER IT IS THE COUNSELING CENTER OR WHETHER IT IS THE HEALTH CENTER ON CAMPUS OR WHETHER IF THEY'RE HAVING SOME ISSUES WITH AGAIN WITH REGARDS TO WHETHER IT'S HOMELESSNESS SOME MENTAL HEALTH. ISSUES THAT THERE ARE CONTACT THAT'S PART OF THE TRAINING THAT OUR COACHES GO THROUGH SO THEY KNOW WHO ARE THE PARTNERS ON. CAMPUS THAT THEY CAN BRING STUDENTS TO. WELL FOR THOSE WHO FOLLOW THE- EDUCATION BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS THIS PAST YEAR WE SPENT A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME ON A MENTAL HEALTH ON THE Q. THREE TWELVE CAMPUSES IN OUR HIGHER EDUCATION CAMPUSES COMMUNITY COLLEGE THE ISSUE YOU SEE. AND HEARD FROM A VARIETY OF STUDENTS DURING THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD ABOUT CANCELING THE DELAYS IN IN THE TRAINING COACHING SERVICES AT A **** A MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELLING SERVICES IN A VARIETY OF OTHER RELATED ISSUES WE DID OUR BEST.

AND BEFORE WE- WANTED TO SHARE A- PERSONAL ANECDOTE ON THIS ISSUE OF. MENTAL HEALTH. AND WHEN I WAS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES WE HAD A PRESENTATION ON. THIS BROADER CATEGORY OF ISSUES AND I. I ASKED THE QUESTION. WHAT'S THE AVERAGE WAIT TIME TO IF SOMEONE SAYS I AM HAVING A- DIFFICULT TIME STRESSED OUT. WHAT'S THE AVERAGE WAIT TIME IN THE C. S. UCF COUNSELOR. AND THE ANSWER BACK WAS ABOUT THREE WEEKS. YESTERDAY DOMINGUEZ HILLS I ASKED THE- THE DOCTOR IN CHARGE OF THE COUNSELING PROGRAM TO.

HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE ME TO SEE SOMEONE AND OBVIOUSLY DEPENDING ON THE TIME OF THE YEAR THAT COULD CHANGE WE GAVE A VERY WIDE RANGE. HE SAID WELL WE WOULD SAY BE BETWEEN FOUR AND EIGHT WEEKS. FOR AN EIGHT WEEKS FOR SOMEONE WHO'S UNDER GREAT DEAL OF STRESS. SO WE LOOK FOR YOUR INSIGHT AND WISDOM ABOUT HOW THINGS ARE GOING HERE. AND I DO FIND IT SAID IT'S A CHALLENGE FOR US TO NOT JUST DEAL WITH THE STIGMA. OF MENTAL HEALTH AND THAT THAT CRAZY STIGMA WHICH SHOULDN'T BE THERE. BUT TO GET THE SUPPORT THAT OUR COUNSELORS NEED TO BE ABLE TO SERVICE STUDENT BODY LIKE THIS. LOOK FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING EVERYONE SO AGAIN IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN MY POSITION AS WELL AS THE AREA OF STUDENT HEALTH AND WELL BEING WAS CREATED AND INCLUDED THE INTEGRATION OF THE FOLLOWING PROGRAMS STUDENT HEALTH SERVICES BRONCO WELLNESS WHICH IS OUR HEALTH EDUCATION AREA COUNSELING AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES DISABILITY RESOURCE CENTER WHICH ALSO INCLUDES AN ACHIEVEMENT RETENTION AND COMMITMENT TO HIGHER EDUCATION SUCCESS GRANT PROGRAM.

IN TERMS OF BEST PRACTICES AS A COUNSELOR FOR EVERY FIFTEEN HUNDRED STUDENTS. SOLANA IMPROVEMENT FROM TWENTY TWO HUNDRED TO ONE IS TO TWENTY. AT TWENTY TWO THOUSAND ONE IS A IS GOOD THERE'S STILL ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT THERE YES AND HERE'S THE PROVERBIAL QUESTION I'M A STUDENT HERE AT POMONA. AND I'M VERY VERY STRESSED OUT. AND THAT I NEED SOMEONE TO TALK TO. AN OUTHOUSE AND CAN I GET AN APPOINTMENT IF IT'S AN URGENT MATTER HANNAH CRISIS YOU CAN SEE SOMEONE. J. IF IT ISN'T IN OUR J. CRISIS MATTER YOU CAN SEE SOMEONE WITHIN ONE TO TWO WEEKS SOMEONE TWO WEEKS IS THE- IS THE ANSWER. AND CERTAINLY THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO WORK ON AND TRY TO IMPROVE UPON BECAUSE- IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE REALLY STRESSED OUT AND YOU'RE REACHING OUT. IT'S NOT USUALLY AND IF YOU'RE NOT SAYING THE WORD SUICIDE OR TAKING YOUR OWN LIFE FOR HARMING YOURSELF. YOU'RE GONNA BE IN THAT THAT. THAT GROUP THAT'S GONNA HAVE TO SIT AROUND AND WAIT AWHILE. UNDER GREAT DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES THAT NO ONE WOULD WANT ANYONE TO THE KIND OF FACE. DO YOU WHAT WHAT DO YOU DO WHAT YOU DO WHAT YOU DO ON THE CAMPUS TO DE STIGMATIZE. COUNSELING MENTAL HEALTH. ASSISTANCE WHAT WHAT WHAT EFFORTS TO GO ON TO. HELP IMPROVE THAT RELATIONSHIP. I THINK DEFINITELY WHEN WE HAVE BIG CAMPUS WIDE EVENTS SUCH AS THE SUN SIGNS BACKING THAT SENSE THAT. GIVES THE MESSAGE THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND THAT WE WANT SINCE YOU SEE THAT OTHERS ARE EXPERIENCING CONCERNS THAT ARE RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH WE HAVE WE OFFER WORKSHOPS IN MANY DIFFERENT AREAS ON CAMPUS SO THAT STUDENTS CAN. FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE ATTENDING AMENITY. FOR TO MY CLASSES IN THE ROOM WHO ELSE WANTS TO ASK ABOUT. RATHER THAN WAIT WE ARE CURRENTLY IN MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS WEEK I KNOW AND HAVE A LOT OF EVENTS GOING ON. AROUND IT NO AND I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT AND I THINK AS A STUDENT LEADER SAID TO ME. THIS MORNING THAT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT A WEEK IT'S A GOOD THING TO HAVE A WEEK WE FOCUS ON IT. BUT IT'S REALLY FIFTY TWO WEEKS A BOX OF RECENTLY WE HAVE AN INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT AND WE'RE SHARING A LOT OF INFORMATION ACTUALLY ACROSS ALL THE SOCIAL MEDIA. FOR THAT WELLBEING AREA WE SHARE FOR ALL AREAS SO HEALTH AND COUNSELING AND DISABILITY RESOURCE CENTER WE CROSS SHARE AND WE HAVE STUDENTS. COMMENTING ON THAT. THAT'S THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR. DROPPING I START NANCY RATHER THAN. WE ALSO HAVE. CAN YOU HEAR ME WE ALSO HAVE DROP IN GROUPS EVERY MONTH AND CHATS AND DIFFERENT CENTERS ACROSS CULTURAL CENTERS DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS OF PRESENTATIONS THAT WE DO REQUEST OF DIFFERENT INSTRUCTORS ON HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS IS IT IN DISTRESS HOW TO MANAGE ANXIETY TEST TAKING AND JUST DIFFERENT THINGS SO WE TRY TO MAKE A PRESENCE IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS ON CAMPUS BY REQUEST AND ALSO. ALSO IN DIFFERENT EVENTS LIKE DIFFERENT FARES WE HAVE FOR EXAMPLE. YEAH THOSE MARTYRS COMING AND COMING UP IN NOVEMBER AND ARE LATER IN OCTOBER AND FOR THAT DAY WERE DOING A REMEMBRANCE AND WE'RE USING A MENTAL HEALTH FAME SO WE TRY TO PARTICIPATE IN DIFFERENT EVENTS SO THAT THE MENTAL HEALTH THEME IS PRESENT IN. MIKE TALKED ABOUT THAT'S VERY GOOD. DO YOU DO ANY DATA COLLECTION OF STUDENTS IN TERMS OF THEIR ISSUES OF STRESS AND MENTAL HEALTH. YES AND WE ALSO PARTICIPATE IN THE NATIONAL COLLEGE HEALTH ASSESSMENT. THAT'S WHERE WE GET OUR GOT THE NUMBERS AROUND ANXIETY DEPRESSION AND STRESS AND ALSO SLEEP. YES NO THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR AT THE CAMPUS WE WERE AT YESTERDAY THE DATA THAT THEY GOT FROM THEIR STUDENT BODY WAS THAT. OF 14% ATKINS AT CONSIDERED TAKING THEIR OWN LIFE. THE PAST YEAR 14% SO THERE'S THAT. JUST SAID WHICH ARE SICK IS IT'S CRITICAL TO WHAT WE ARE ALL FOCUSING ON HERE ACCOUNT MIKE THE MONA IS THAT IT'S IMPORTANT WHEN STUDENTS FIRST ARRIVE SO WE HAVE TOTALLY CHANGED OUR ORIENTATION PROGRAM OF FOCUSING ON SPEECH STUDENTS AS THEY COME INTO THE UNIVERSITY SO THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE NUMBER OF AREAS THAT MAY AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO MATRICULATING. IN THERE MAY BE PHYSICAL THERE MAY BE MENTAL HEALTH THERE MAY BE JUST NOT KNOWING HOW TO NAVIGATE THIS LARGE UNIVERSITY AND SO THE FOCUS HAS BEEN TO AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WITH THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE. TO MAKE THE STUDENTS AWARE. ON AN AS NEEDED BASIS BECAUSE MANY TIMES THE STUDENTS AREN'T IT'S NOT UNTIL THEY GO TO THEIR FIRST SEMESTER THAT WE FIND THAT. THE STRESS THE ANXIETY AND SO FORTH AND SO WE WANT TO WANT TO NOT ONLY WITH ACCESS TO BILLY CHAT WITH COMING INTO THE UNIVERSITY THE ORIENTATION SESSIONS ARE MAKING THEM AWARE AND NORMALIZING. WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A STUDENT AN INDIVIDUAL WHERE WE ALL HAVE STRESSORS THAT ALL HAVE PROBLEMS THAT WE WANT TO SUPPORT YOU IN IN ADDRESSING SO YOUR POINT ABOUT IT NOT JUST. A ONE WEEK IT IS A ROW HOW DO WE INSTITUTIONALIZE IN FACT WHAT IS ARE ON OUR ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS AND DEAL WITH THOSE BARRIERS THAT PREVENT YOU FROM HAVING THE SUCCESS THAT WE EXPECT UP YOU. THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT AND BEFORE I GO TO SENATOR ROTH ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF GOING TO A LOT OF COLLEGE CAMPUSES YOU GET TO HEAR A LOT OF DIFFERENT PRACTICES IN SOME CASES YOU KNOW BEST PRACTICES AND- ONE OF THE TAKE AWAYS FROM ONE OF OUR CAMPUS VISITS WAS THE FACULTY REPRESENTATIVE SAYING THAT. AS A PART OF EVERY SYLLABUS IN A CLASS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE. IS A AN EXPLANATION INFORMATION ABOUT BASIC NEED ISSUES. I THOUGHT WOW THAT'S THAT'S REALLY CONNECTING IT TO. YOU KNOW WHAT WE THINK IS THE HEART OF THE UNIVERSITY WRITE THE ACADEMICS BUT YET WE HAVE TO NOW IT'S THE WHOLE PERSON HAS TO BE THERE IF IT'S OVER TO BE SUCCESSFUL SO I SURE THAT. A BEST PRACTICES SENATE ROTH. THANK YOU MR TRUMP I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT HOW THE MENTAL HEALTH. COUNSELING PEACE WORKS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CANCERS OF THE HEALTH PRACTITIONER. PSYCHOLOGISTS SOCIAL WORKERS OR SOMETHING ELSE I'LL BE ABOUT WE HAVE. LIFE PSYCHOLOGIST WE HAVE LICENSED MARRIAGE FAMILY. COUNSELLING TREATMENTS SO I'VE STUDENTS ARE REFERRED OUT IF THEY HAVE. THEY NEED MORE LONGER TERM TREATMENT SO WE HAVE ALSO WHAT WE HAVE OUR WELLBEING COACH ALSO SERVES AS OUR CASE MANAGER. WAS THIS THE STUDENT IN MAKING THAT CONNECTION WITH AND OUTSIDE RESOURCES AND ENSURES THAT THE WARM HAND OFF OCCURS SO NOT JUST GIVING THEM THE NUMBER BUT ENSURING THAT THEY ACTUALLY GET CONNECTED. THAT'S FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE MORE LONGER TERM WE DO OFFER. SOME LONG TERM CASES BUT NOT EVERY CANCER CAN CAN NOT AT WE CAN'T HAVE ALL STUDENTS BE LONG TERM CARE. SO WHEN THE WHEN THE WARM HAND OFF OCCURS IN THE STUDENTS IS ASSISTED WITH THE- OUTSIDE REFERRAL WHO PAYS FOR THE OUTSIDE SERVICES RYAN WELL WHEN THE HAVE INSURANCE. THEIR PRIVATE INSURANCE BUT THAT IS AN AREA. OF NEED DEFINITELY A BASIC NEEDS THAT SOME STUDENTS DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING FOR THAT SO WE DO TAKE ON SOME OF THIS IS THAT WE TAKE ON LONG TERM. OUR STUDENTS WHO CANNOT ACTUALLY AFFORD IT. RIGHT AND THE REASON I ASKED THE QUESTION YOU KNOW WE- AS I SAID IT WAS ALWAYS HANNAH HAD COME BUT WITH THE BUDGET WE WERE ABLE TO PUT ABOUT SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR. FOR ADDITIONAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SOME OF THAT HIGHER EDUCATION NOT NEARLY. ENOUGH FOR HIGHER EDUCATION FRANKLY NOT NEARLY NEARLY ENOUGH FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE. I ASKED THE QUESTION BECAUSE I REALIZE ALTHOUGH WE NEED TO DO MORE FOR THE UC SYSTEM AS WELL BUT THERE IS A- WHAT ABOUT A MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE UC SYSTEM IN THE C. ISSUE INSTITUTION AND THAT'S YOU SEE HEALTH AND THAT'S THE INSURANCE OF PROGRAMS THAT. THE UC PROVIDES SO. FOR ITS. STUDENTS PROBABLY MANDATES AS I RECALL. AND FOR C. ISSUE IS HISTORICALLY NOT DONE THAT DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT PERCENTAGE OF YOUR- STUDENT POPULATION IS SOMEHOW COVERED BY. INSURANCE IT INCLUDES MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE COVERAGE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER WITH WE CAN GET IT IT'LL BE SOMETHING THAT I'LL BE TALKING TO THE INSTITUTION ABOUT WHEN WE START THE BUDGET CONVERSATION THIS YEAR. BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CRACK THAT NOT. WE'RE EITHER GONNA HAVE TO PROVIDE MORE MONEY. TO THE INSTITUTION INTO THE INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES TO BE FOR MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING SERVICES FOR STUDENTS OR WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. MAKE SURE THAT THE STUDENTS HAVE THE INSURANCE COVERAGE THAT THEY NEED TO PROVIDE AT LEAST SOME. PORTION OF MENTAL HEALTH. SERVICES THE WE CAN'T PROVIDE ON THE CAMPUS SO. THANK YOU MR LINCOLN CENTER ON A RECESSION VERY GOOD CENTER CHANG. THANK YOU DO YOU HAVE SPECIFIC DATA BEHIND THE MENTAL HEALTH WHETHER OR NOT IT'S DRIVEN BY. ACTIVITIES AT THE SCHOOL OR SITUATION AT FIRST BUT FOR A FIFTH SEVEN STRESSORS THE DISTRESS LARA WE DO HAVE INFORMATION AROUND THAT SOME OF THE STUDENTS ALREADY COME INTO CAMPUS WITH PRE EXISTING MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS SUBSTANCE ARE EXPERIENCING TRAUMA MAYBE TRY MEXICAN C. WHILE IN SCHOOL BASED ON A LOST A FAMILY MEMBER OR- YOU KNOW IT DRAMATIC SITUATIONS SEXUAL ASSAULT THAT MIGHT OCCUR. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE REASONS WHY THEY'RE SHARING BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING MORE AS AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS COMING AND WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS ALREADY AND EVEN IN THE SEVERITY OF. WHAT THEY'RE PRESENTING WITH IN TERMS OF THEIR MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. WE DO HAVE THAT I CAN SHARE THOSE WITH. THAT'S A GREAT AND IN TERMS OF HOUSING AND THIS IS JUST MY BEING OFF THE WHOLE QUESTION BUT I STARTED NOTICING THIS A LOT ON. ON YOUTUBE WHERE STUDENTS ARE NOW LIVING OFF THE GRID. BECAUSE THEY CHOOSE TO THAT THE BAND LIKE THE CAUGHT THE BAND LIFE AND THEY- CHOOSE TO DO THOSE THOSE US STUDENTS IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AS HOMELESS. I'M GOING TO DEFER THAT TO OUR BASIC NEEDS COORDINATOR JUDY ARE YOU SEEING THAT. AT HELLO MY NAME IS JUDY AND THE BASIC NEEDS COORDINATOR I HAVE SEEN THAT AS STUDENTS WHO DO IDENTIFY WITH THE VAN LIFE AS YOU MENTIONED. AND THEY DO CONSIDER THEMSELVES SELVES HOMELESS ON THE STUDENTS THAT I DO WORK WITH WE TALK ABOUT RESOURCES AND THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE BOTH SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM SHORT TERM MEANING ARE TEMPORARY UNIVERSITY HOUSING. AND LONG TERM IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW LOOKING AT HOW CAN WE GET THE STUDENT YOU KNOW ADJUSTED THEIR FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE HOW DO WE GET THEM CONNECTED WITH SOME REGULAR INCOME SO LOOKING IN. I CONNECTING THEM WITH SERVICES SUCH AS CAL FIRST CAL WORKS BUT ALSO SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY I WILL SAY THAT WORKING WITH NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS OR IT'S JUST STUDENTS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY SIX RANGE. IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO SEE TO GET SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY FOR FOLKS OUTSIDE OF THAT COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE HOMELESS SO THINKING ABOUT A STUDENT WHO MIGHT BE. THIRTY FIVE YEARS OLD AND LIVING ON THEIR OWN HOMELAND SIME AND WITHOUT ANY CHILDREN THE SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY ARE A LOT LESS COMPARED TO A STUDENT WHO IS EIGHTEEN AND HOMELESS ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING STUDENTS WHO HAVE FAMILIES AS WELL. SO I AM. DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION YEAH. OKAY SENATORS NANCY SOMETHING ON ONE OF THE STUDENT YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELF MY NAME'S LOUIS BUT TO COLONEL I'M A STUDENT HERE AT CAL POLY POMONA. I'VE BEEN RECENTLY WENT THROUGH SOME FINANCIAL NEEDS AND HUNGER AND HOMELESSNESS AND- I JUST WANNA THING JUDY WHAT IS SHE'S AMAZING. FOR THE WORK THAT SHE DOES I KNOW MY SCENE THE NUMBERS. NOW THEY LOOKING GOOD AND THE- AND THE DATABASES BUT THEY'RE REALLY GRATEFUL STAFF COORDINATORS. AND I'M REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THEIR SUPPORT AND THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT STORY THANK YOU AND I'M SURE IT'S REPEATED MANY TIMES OVER BY MANY OTHERS. THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT I KNOW WE'RE GONNA TOUR THE FOOD FOOD PANTRY AFTER THE GERMAN OF THIS HEARING. AND WE'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE DISCUSSIONS WITH THAT SOMEONE THANK YOU THE DOCTOR.

AND YOU'RE GONNA STAY SHARE YOUR STORY AND YOUR INSIGHT ON THE ROLE OF DISABILITY READ THE RESOURCE CENTER. HELPING STUDENTS HERE ON THE CAMPUS. SO WELCOME. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU. THE D. R. C. WITHIN THE CLUSTER OF STUDENT HEALTH AND WELL BEING IS THE DEPARTMENT ON CAMPUS THAT DETERMINES APPROPRIATE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. THEIR EDUCATION AND OUTREACH THE D. R. C. WORKS CLOSELY WITH FACULTY TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE. NEEDED TO CREATE AN INCLUSIVE EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT FOR A COUPLE OF MONNING STUDENTS. BY PARTNERING WITH FACULTY WE COLLECTIVELY ENSURE STUDENTS EXPERIENCE ACCESS IN THEIR COURSE. WORK THROUGH ACCOMMODATIONS OR OTHER OUTCOMES. IN THE PAST TEN YEARS THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES ACT HELP HOLLY POMONA HAS MORE THAN TRIPLED. WITH JUST OVER FOUR HUNDRED STUDENTS IN TWO THOUSAND NINE TO PROTECTED TWELVE HUNDRED STUDENTS BY THE END OF THIS ACADEMIC YEAR. THIS REPRESENTS ABOUT 3% OF THE UNDERGRADUATE POPULATION. HOWEVER NATIONAL DATA TELLS US THAT ROUGHLY 11% OF ALL ENROLLED UNDERGRADUATES HAVE A DISABILITY. ALTHOUGH OUR NUMBERS HAVE INCREASED IMMENSELY THERE ARE ADDITIONAL KAPALI POMONA STUDENTS WHO COULD POTENTIALLY QUALIFY FOR SERVICES. WELL OUR DATA SHOWS GROWTH IN ALL DISABILITY TYPES THE AREA WITH THE LARGEST INCREASES MENTAL HEALTH. WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS STUDENTS SEEKING ACCOMMODATIONS FOR MENTAL HEALTH DISABILITIES HAS INCREASED BY OVER ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY PERCENT. THE DEER C. HAVE STRENGTHEN OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH COUNSELING AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS WHO ARE BEING SEEN BY CAPS FOR COUNSELLING. ARE ALSO THEN BEING REFERRED TO THE D. R. C. FOR THE ACADEMIC ACCOMMODATIONS AND SUPPLEMENTAL SUPPORTS THEY NEED TO PERSIST. THESE TYPES OF COLLABORATIONS ARE CRITICAL TO CONNECTING STUDENTS TO ACCOMMODATIONS WHEN THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE NOT BEEN AWARE THAT THEY WERE ELIGIBLE FOR D. R. C. SERVICES. THE DEER C. ALSO SUPPORT STUDENTS WITH MENTAL HEALTH DISABILITIES THROUGH INVOLVEMENT IN OUR CAMPUSES INTEGRATIVE CARE NETWORK. DEAR C. CURRENTLY HAS TO STOP SERVING AS CARE COORDINATORS WITHIN THE NETWORK. THESE INDIVIDUALS NOT ONLY PRESCRIBE ACCOMMODATIONS BUT THEY SEEK TO IMPROVE ACCESS AND CONNECTIONS TO RESOURCES THROUGH COORDINATED EFFORTS. SENDING US APART FROM OTHER CAMPUSES IS OUR CARE COORDINATORS STUDENT SUCCESS COACHING. OUR ARTISAN SPECIALIST PROVIDES ENGAGEMENT COACHING A PROGRAM THAT FOCUSES ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF STUDENT'S SELF DETERMINATION. THIS INCLUDES SELF AWARENESS SELF ADVOCACY AND BEHAVIORAL SELF REGULATION. OUR ADHD SPECIALIST PROVIDES EXECUTIVE SKILLS COACHING. A STRING SPACE PROGRAMS THAT ASSIST STUDENTS IN OVERCOMING EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING CHALLENGES INCLUDING TIME MANAGEMENT. PLANNING AND ORGANIZATION. THIS EIGHT WEEK PROGRAM WAS INTRODUCED THIS PAST WINTER AND HAD AN IMMEDIATE WAIT LIST WHICH ONLY DEMONSTRATES STUDENTS NEEDS FOR THESE TYPES OF SERVICES. LASTLY THE DRC INITIATED A PEER MENTORING PROGRAM WHERE D. R. C. STUDENTS APPEARS MET REGULARLY TO DISCUSS ACADEMIC CHALLENGES. AND A LITTLE MORE THAN SIX MONTHS IN EXISTENCE DEAR C. STUDENTS PARTICIPATED IN OVER ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE COACHING. AND TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY PEER MENTORING SESSIONS. THESE TYPES OF SUPPORT SERVICES IN ADDITION TO MANDATED ACCOMMODATIONS ARE IMPORTANT TO ENSURING STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES SUCCEED. THE DEER C. CONTINUES TO LOOK AT INNOVATIVE WAYS TO INCREASE RETENTION AND GRADUATION RATES OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. WELL THE DEER SHE'S PRIMARY ROLE IS TO PRY IT IS TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO ACCOMMODATIONS WE RECOGNIZED AXIS ALONE HAS NOT MET THE STUDENTS UNIQUE NEEDS AND ACHIEVING ACADEMIC SUCCESS. IN ADDITION TO THE CARE COORDINATORS WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF HIRING AN ACADEMIC OUTREACH ADVISER WHO WILL PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTAL RISING AND DEVELOP A NEW PEER TUTORING PROGRAM. THE DEER SHE'S PULLED TO MY GOAL IS TO CREATE A CENTER THAT WILL PROVIDE EACH STUDENT WITH AN INDIVIDUALIZED PLAN OF SERVICES. INCLUDING SUPPLEMENTAL ADVISING DISABILITY MANAGEMENT CAREER AND GRADUATE SCHOOL GUIDANCE PEER TUTORING AND MENTORING AND REALLY A HOME BASED UPON TO FOSTER A SENSE OF CONNECTION THAT WILL COURAGE THEM TO SEEK THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO PERSIST AND GRADUATE.

THE LEGISLATION THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND FOR SHARING THAT THE STUDENTS YOU WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE AND THE CAMPUS AND SUPPORT AREAS THANK YOU RACHEL THANK YOU A GOOD MORNING. THROUGHOUT MY FOUR YEARS BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED WITH MY MAJOR CLUBS AND AS I. STERN GOVERNMENT I'VE EXPERIENCED THE EVOLUTION OF THE RESPONSE TO OUR STUDENTS FOOD INSECURITY IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN STUDENT LEADERS PAST THE S. I. SENATE BILL THE POLY PANTRY COMMITTING STUDENT DOLLARS TO IDENTIFYING THE NEED FUNNY IN A FULL TIME POSITION AND ESTABLISHING A AND ACCESSIBLE LOCATION FOR PERMANENT FOOD PANTRY. BEFORE THE POLY PANTRY WAS ESTABLISHED CAL POLY POMONA COLLABORATED WITH EXTERNAL PARTNERS LIKE SO IN FUTURE LIFE TOP MOBILE FOOD PANTRIES TO ASSIST STUDENTS IN IMMEDIATE NEED. WELL AS I WAS WORKING ON THE POLY PANTRY THE UNIVERSITY WAS WORKING ON THE ENTRY. INTEGRATED CARE NETWORK ALLOWING THE S. I. KERR QUARTER TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THIS NETWORK. THIS NETWORK HAS CONNECTED STUDENTS TO MUCH NEEDED RESOURCES AND GIVING CONSTANT OPPORTUNITIES PER STUDENT LEADERS TO BE AT THE TABLE ADVOCATING FOR STUDENTS NEEDS. OUR CAMPUS HAS MADE THE CONTINUAL COMMITMENT TO STALKING THE POLY PANTRY FOR COORDINATING STRATEGIC CHANGES THAT HELP COMBAT THE INCREASING NEED. OUR CLUBS AND ORGANIZATIONS HAVE RISEN TO THE CHALLENGE BY TAILORING THEIR EVENTS ROUND DONATING FOOD. THE AGRICULTURAL CLUBS HAVE CHOSEN TO MAKE THE POLY PANTRY PART OF THEIR ACT BEAUTIFICATION PROJECT ENCOURAGING THEIR MEMBERS TO TONY BACK TO THE CAMPUS COMMUNITY. THE FRATERNITIES AND SORORITIES DONATED OVER FOUR THOUSAND CANCER THE POLY PEAR TREE AS A COMPETITION AMONG THEIR ORGANIZATIONS. AND THE COMMUNITY SERVICE CLUBS ENCOURAGE THEIR MEMBERS TO DONATE THEIR TIME TO THE HOLLY PANTRY. AMONG THE UNIVERSITY THERE ALSO SHIPS SHIPS TO HELP AS WELL. UP ALL CONFERENCE ONE OF THE UNIVERSITY'S BIGGEST EVENTS THEIR DECORATIONS ARE PURELY ITEMS THAT CAN BE DONATED DONATED BACK TO THE HOLLY PANTRY. ADDITIONALLY SOME SERVICE LEARNING COURSES HAVE YOU NEVER EVEN ALLOWED STUDENTS TO VOLUNTEER AT THE PANTRY. FOR CREDIT IN THEIR COURSES. AS THE POLY PANTRY GO GROWS. STUDENT LEADERS ARE ATTEMPTING TO EXPAND THE SERVICES OFFERED OFFERED BY A SITE IN THE UNIVERSITY. THERE ARE CONNECTIONS WITH SOWING SEEDS FOR LIFE WE HAVE PARLAYED WE HAVE PILOTED A PROGRAM TO OFFER FREE MITCHELL PRODUCTS AN ACE I OWN FACILITIES. IN S. I. WE AMPLIFY THE STUDENT VOICE BY CULTIVATING VITAL STUDENT PROGRAMS SERVICES AND SPACES TO CREATE THE CONDITIONS FOR COMMUNITY AND SELF. FULFILLMENT IN ORDER TO AMPLIFY TRADITIONALLY UNDERSERVED VOICES YES I STUDENT GOVERNMENT HAS CREATED THREE NEW POSITIONS THE SI OFFICER BASIC MEANS OFFICER DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION AND OFFICER TRANSFER ENGAGEMENT. THE STUDENTS HAVE WORKED TIRELESSLY TO CREATE AND COLLABORATE WITH THE UNIVERSITY ON INITIATIVES LIKE HUNGER AND HOMELESS WEEK NATIONAL TRANSFER WEAK AND CAMPUS CLIMATE EVENTS. IN ALL OF THESE PROJECTS AND INITIATIVES YES I AM UNIVERSITY WORK HAND IN HAND TO HELP STUDENTS KNOW THAT THEY BELONG HERE CAL POLY POMONA. TEST OR RACHEL THANK YOU AND THANK YOU TO YOUR STUDENT. COMMUNITY FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE UNIVERSITY SAY HERE THAT IN A LOT OF YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY THAT. THESE THINGS JUST DIDN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE ONE IT'S C. SAID WE CARE BUT- EVERYBODY WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE PRESIDENT. HOLLY AND YOUR STAFF ALL HE WOULD SAY ASIDE AND ADVANCE THESE INITIATIVES ARE. IT'S GOOD TO GOOD TO HEAR ABOUT. ABOUT AND THAT. WE HAVE RECENTLY THIS THIS PAST YEAR BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE ARE NUMBER OF CIVIC AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION GROUPS. THEY HAVE NOW DONATED WE HAVE ONE GROUP THIS NON DONATED FROM THEIR FUND RAISER TO THE A. S. I. POLY PANTRY AND SOME OF THE MEMBERS. OF THIS COMMUNITY GROUP NOW VOLUNTEER TO WORK IN THE POLY PANTRY A PARTICULAR POINT SO THE COMMUNITY IS ALSO VERY MUCH BECOMING A PART. OF THIS BORDER BORDER AFTER IT. THAT'S REALLY GOOD TO HEAR AND- MAYBE I ASKED THE OBVIOUS QUESTION YOU'VE BEEN HERE FOR FOUR YEARS AND I KNOW YOUR ENGAGEMENT. IN STUDENT LEADERSHIP IS NOT JUST STARTED YOUR ONE BUT IN EACH OF THESE AREAS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HOUSING. IN A IN SECURITY FOOD AND SECURITY NESTLE HELP. GRADUATING YOU KNOW ON TIME. GIVE US YOUR PERSPECTIVE THINGS UP AT ABOUT THE SAME OR THINGS GETTING BETTER THINGS HAVE GOTTEN WORSE. FOR STUDENTS HOW HOW WOULD YOU ASSESS THAT. WELL WHEN IT COMES TO FOOD INSECURITY I DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASE IN RESOURCES AVAILABLE FROM MY FIRST YEAR I HAD NO IDEA WHAT CAL FRESH WAS BUT THROUGHOUT MY INVOLVEMENT IN THROUGHOUT ON THE ORIENTATION SERVICES. THAT TRYING TO EXPOSE MORE STUDENTS TO OPTIONS THAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE THROUGH COW FRESH THROUGH THE FOOD PANTRY. SO I REALLY DO FEEL LIKE OUR RESPONSE TO FOOD AND SECURITY HAS BEEN PRETTY ROBUST. AND I THINK THAT WE'RE SUPPORTING OUR STUDENTS AS MUCH AS WE CAN AT THIS POINT. I OF COURSE THE NEXT BIGGEST CHALLENGE I FEEL LIKE FOR US IS HOUSING AND SECURITY EVEN THOUGH WE CAN COLLABORATE AS MUCH AS WE CAN WITH EXTERNAL PARTNERS WE HAVE EMERGENCY HOUSING. MOST STUDENTS DON'T KNOW THE RESOURCES AND SO. ESPECIALLY IF I HAD BEEN DOING OUR BEST TO COLLAPSE BY. WITH OUR STUDENTS WHICH IS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WE MEET THE- BASIC NEEDS OFFICER. JUST BECAUSE THAT'S A REAL BIG FOCUS ON COMMUNICATION BECAUSE WE CAN HAVE ALL THE RESOURCES THAT WE DO HAVE THE COMMUNICATIONS WITH STUDENTS IS KEY. AND I REALLY DO FEEL LIKE SI ON PLAYS A CRUCIAL PART IN THAT. YEAH. COURSE CAN I ADD TO THAT WE'VE ALSO COLLABORATED WITH OUR UNIVERSITY POLICE OF THEY ARE OUT PATROLLING AND THEY C. STUDENT WHO POTENTIALLY MAYBE EXPERIENCING HOUSING AND SECURITIES THAT THEY PROVIDE THEM WITH A HANDOUT THAT HAS OUR RESOURCES AND A RACIAL ONE BOB I'LL FOLLOW UP FOR ME DO YOU FEEL LIKE I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF STUDENTS THAT THAT THAT THEY DON'T ENGAGE THEY COME TO THE CAMPUS WITH BLINDERS ON. BY THEIR CLASS FIND THE RESTROOM AND THEN FIND THE CAR AND THAT'S ALWAYS A CHALLENGE TO DEAL WITH A LOT OF LEVELS BUT DO YOU FEEL THAT THE CAMPUS IS DOING ENOUGH TO CREATE THE AWARENESS LEVEL AT ALL THESE ARE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF HELPING HANDS HERE THAT'S OVER HERE AND THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE CARE AND WANT TO HELP DID YOU FEEL LIKE THAT IS ENOUGH BEING DONE SO THAT THE STUDENTS THAT ARE HAVE BLINDERS ON OR WE'RE GETTING IN THEIR SPACE AND. THE RIGHT WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM AND- LET THEM KNOW. OUR I WAS ASKED TO GET MY FIRST YEAR I WOULD PARK COME TO MY CLASS AND LEAVE IT WAS ONLY THROUGH. THE STUDENTS WHO ENCOURAGED ME TO GET INVOLVED BUT I DID GET INVOLVED. SO I DEFINITELY KNOW THAT STRUGGLE AND I THINK THE NEW APPROACH TO MAKING SURE THE ADVISORS KNOW ABOUT THESE. RESOURCES AND REALLY CONNECTING OUR STUDENTS IS WHERE THE MOST HELP WILL BE BECAUSE STUDENTS ARE FORCED TO GO. TO ADVISE AND THEY SHOULD GO TO ADVISING TO GRADUATE. BECAUSE THE STUDENTS WERE BLINDERS ARE REALLY ABOUT GETTING THEIR DEGREE IN GETTING OUT. SO I THINK THE MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH OF MAKING SURE ADVISORS KNOW ABOUT ALL OF THESE RESOURCES AND CONNECTING STUDENTS. IT'S REALLY A GOOD PART ESPECIALLY IN CLASS EVEN THOUGH I HAVE NOT BEEN A PART OF THE STUDY OR THE CLASS COACHING BECAUSE I'M A FOURTH YEAR. THE PART OF MAKING SURE THAT ADVISERS ARE COACHING THE STUDENTS AS WELL AS ADVISING THEM ON THEIR ACADEMICS I THINK MAKES THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE. THAT'S CERTAINLY A BIG INDOOR. SPIN ABOUT DOCTOR LIVING. PROGRAM. AT HER COLLEGE AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A APPLIED ACROSS THE BOARD TO THE OTHER COLLEGES HERE BUT CERTAINLY I. IT'S A GOOD POINT OF AFFIRMATION FOR THAT GOOD WORK OF. CONNECTING EVEN IF IT'S ON THE ACADEMIC SIDE. IT'S ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR A TOUCH THAT COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN A PERSON'S LIFE. I ATE ABOUT. THAT'S OKAY I WANT TO OPEN UP OUR PUBLIC HEARING FOR THOSE WHO. HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE TO SHARE SOME THOUGHTS WE- WE ARE ON A SCHEDULE SO WE ARE OPEN TO. ASK YOU TO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS BRIEF BUT- ANYBODY HERE WOULD LIKE TO SHOW US THE ANY THOUGHTS WITH US ON THE ISSUES AT HAND. WHEN WALKING INTO THE CENTER OF THE- OF THE ROOM WITH A MICROPHONE IS THERE TO. FOR ALL OF US. HERE AND THOSE WATCHING AT HOME TWO. OTHER OFFICES HERE AS WELL. ANYONE HAVE ANYTHING THEY WANT TO COME COME ON UP TO THE MICROPHONE. AND YOU'RE WELCOME TO SHARE YOUR NAME IF YOU WISH. HI GOOD AFTERNOON FERMENTERS I WANT TO HI MY NAME'S FOR CAL AND I WORK AT COUNSELING AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES.

I'VE BEEN ABLE TO LINK STUDENTS THAT DON'T HAVE INSURANCE. TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BOTH PSYCHIATRIC AND LONG TERM THERAPY WITHIN THE COMMUNITY SO THERE ARE SO THERE IS THAT TYPE OF SERVICE AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. I'M ALSO WORKING WITH SOME STUDENTS ON FINDING AND REPLYING TO MEDIC CAL FOR THOSE THAT. DO QUALIFY AND WHAT ELSE. I THINK A REBOUND CORONADO WHO'S THE DIRECTOR OF HE- THE LEAD EXCUSE ME OUT FOR THE ENIGMA INTEGRATED CARE NETWORK HAS DONE A REALLY OUTSTANDING JOB AND FINDING COMMUNITY PARTNERS. SUCH AS CHARTER OAK HOSPITAL TRI VALLEY. I CITY MENTAL HEALTH AND OTHER. MENTAL HEALTH CLINICS SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE SEEN IN GUARANTEED THAT THE ARE ARE BEING SEEN AND FOLLOWED UP SO I THINK THAT SOME REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH BECAUSE YES THEY DO NEED SERVICES AND SOMETIMES. WE DON'T WANT THEM TO WAIT SO IF I HAVE INSURANCE I CAN CONNECT THEM IF THEY DON'T HAVE INSURANCE I CAN STILL CONNECT THEM SO THAT PARTNERSHIP IS HERE I JOHN M. TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU WERE AWARE. THANK YOU VERY THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE SECOND ONE UP TO THE MICROPHONE STUDENTS HERE. THAT THE STAFF YOU ARE WELCOME TO SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS HI MY NAME IS DESTINY VICKERS ON A TRANSFER STUDENT IS MY FIRST SEMESTER HERE I JUST KAPALI ONE IS A GREAT UNIVERSITY I JUST FEEL THAT THEY CAN BE A LITTLE MORE PARENT FRIENDLY BECAUSE THERE'S NO PARENT HOUSING AND I'M FINDING IT A STRUGGLE TO. ADJUST THEIR SUPPORT WHAT THE LIKE OKAY I'M JUST GOING TO STOP GOING TO SCHOOL BECAUSE IS. TOO MUCH TO FIND I'M RELOCATING FROM VICTORVILLE AND IT'S A. IS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO FIND HOUSING IMAGE DUTY AND THE PRESIDENT OUGHT TO BE ABLE WHEN THEY'VE BEEN HELP ME AS MUCH AS THEY CAN BUT I FEEL LIKE IF THERE WAS. A PLACE FOR PARENTS TO COME TO FEEL MORE WELCOME. LIKE PERMANENT PARENTING HOUSING ON CAMPUS OR NEARBY THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING GREAT. BUT THAT THAT FEEDBACK IS IMPORTANT AND I IS THERE ANY KIND OF. PARENTAL APPARENT. COUNSELING GROUP FOR YES THEY HAVE THOSE ON CAMPUS AND LIKE I SAID MISS JUDY AND- OTHER STAFF ON CAMPUS HAVE BEEN HELPING ME.

SEE YOU SET HIGHER GOALS BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE CAPABLE AS UNIVERSITY AND WITH THE GREAT LEADERSHIP HERE OF DOING EVEN BETTER FOR THE STUDENTS THAT WE HAVE. I DO THINK THAT. THERE THE CONTRACTUAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROMISE IS SOMETHING THAT. IT PLAYS AN IMPORTANT PART IN. GETTING THAT COMMITMENT FROM STUDENTS TO. TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE ACADEMICALLY AND ALSO. TO GET THAT COMMITMENT FROM THE INSTITUTION TO BREAK DOWN BARRIERS THAT ARE THERE. AT VENICE STUDENT FROM. GRADUATING IN FOUR YEARS. I WANT TO APPLAUD THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE ON BASIC NEEDS.
