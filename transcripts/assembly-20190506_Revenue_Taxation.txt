THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- GOOD AFTERNOON AND I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB ONE THIRTY SIX WHICH I AN INTER DO STERN RESPONSE TO THE RECENT COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL. ADMISSIONS TO COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE AS STUDY HIGHLIGHTED THAT AT THIRTY EIGHT COLLEGES IN THE U. S. INCLUDING IVY LEAGUE SCHOOLS. MORE STUDENTS COME FROM THE TOP THE ENTIRE BOTTOM 60%. THIS UNDERLIES THAT STUDENTS FROM LOW TO MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES HAVE EVEN LESS OF A CHANCE OF BEING ADMITTED TO THESE TOP COLLEGES. AND MARCH TWENTY NINETEEN MORE THAN FIFTY PEOPLE WERE CHARGED OR INDICTED BY FEDERAL PROSECUTORS CHARGES RANGE FROM COLLEGE COACHES ALLEGEDLY PAID BY BRIBES STANDARDIZE COLLEGE TESTING ADMINISTRATORS. WHO WERE PAID FOR A HOST OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITY AND PARENTS WHO PAID FOR THEIR CHILDREN TO SECURE IN MISSIONS TO THE BEST UNIVERSITIES THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS TO OFFER? IT'S INVOLVE USED A NUMBER OF SCHEMES WHICH ALSO VIOLATE FEDERAL AND STATE TAX LAWS WILL ALSO REAPING TAX BENEFITS INCLUDING NUMBER. ONE USE OF PARENTS BUSINESS TO INVOICE CONSULTING FEES SO THEY CAN WRITE IT OFF AS A BUSINESS EXPENSE. STOCKTON NATION'S ALLOWED INDIVIDUALS TO WRITE OFF THE MARKET VALUE OF THE STOCK. AS WELL AS AVOIDING PAYING CAPITAL GAIN TAX ON THE APPRECIATION OF THE SHARES A DOUBLE TAX BENEFIT. NUMBER THREE DIRECT MONETARY CHARITABLE DONATION ALLOWED OPPORTUNITY TO WRITE OFF DONATIONS ON THEIR TAXES.

TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NAMED IN THE FEDERAL INDICTMENT AND FOUND GUILTY TO MEND THEIR STATE TAX RETURNS AND DISCLOSURES FOR TAXABLE YEARS BEGINNING ON OR AFTER JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY FOURTEEN THIS CRIMINAL ACTION HAS VICTIMIZE HARD WORKING STUDENTS AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS WHO WERE DOT DENIED IN MISSIONS BECAUSE OF THE ACTIONS OF THOSE INVOLVED AND THEY WERE ABLE TO DO SO AT THE EXPENSE.

ADMISSIONS SCANDAL AND AS THIS CONTINUES THERE CONTINUES TO BE MORE -- TYPES OF INQUIRE ABOUT MANY MORE THAT MAY BE INVOLVED AND SOME HAVE ASKED WILL WILL THIS REALLY RESULT IN ANY RETURN TO OUR TAX BASE AND EVEN IF IT'S A SMALL PERCENTAGE THAT WE GET BACK. THAT IS A GOES A LONG WAY AND TO MAKING SURE THE PUBLIC KNOWS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN -- VERY -- MANY WAYS THAT OUR SYSTEM WAS REALLY ATTACKED BY -- THIS TYPE OF PERSON WHO'S DOWN STARTED THIS ENTRY INTO COLLEGE AND THERE'S VERY REPUTABLE -- CANCERS ACTUALLY BECAUSE WE HAVE A MANY. CAL STATE FULLERTON IN MY DISTRICT WHICH HAS BECOME A BIGGER AND BIGGER COLLEGE -- I'VE MET MANY WHO HELP STUDENTS THROUGH THE PROCESS -- AND I THINK THAT NGUYEN FAMILIES AND AND PARTICULARLY PARENTS KNOW WHERE TO DRAW THE LINE -- THAT CERTAINLY GETTING HELP ALONG THE WAY IS NOT THE PROBLEM IT'S WHEN YOU BREAK THE LAW.

TO AB TEN TWENTY SEVEN BY THE CHAIR. CANADA'S CAM OF GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TEN TWENTY SEVEN WHICH WILL IMPROVE UPON THE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP ESTABLISHED BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GO BIT. BY ALLOWING THE STATE TO DIRECTLY INVEST IN HIGH PERFORMING COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA. AB TEN TWENTY SEVEN WORKS WITHIN THE EXISTING CALIFORNIA COMPETES TAX CREDIT FRAMEWORK BY ALLOWING TAX PAYERS TO OFFER AN INTEREST IN OUR TO ALLOW ALLOWING A TAXPAYER OFTEN AN INTEREST IN ITS COMPANY AS PART OF THE APPLICATION PROCESS. THIS PROGRAM IS COMPLETELY VOLUNTARY AND MADE AT THE ELECTION OF THE COMPANY. BY ALLOWING THE STATE TO CONSIDER THE OWNERSHIP INTEREST AS ONE OF THE FACTORS IN EVALUATING APPLICATIONS COMPANIES THAT ARE UNABLE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE ON PAR WITH LARGER COMPANIES WILL HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF QUALIFYING FOR THE PROGRAM. ALLOWING TO SHARE THE STATE IN THE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY WILL ALSO ALLOW US TO RAISE THE CAPITAL NEEDED TO MAKE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT IS CURRENTLY ALLOCATED TO GO BIZ. IN FACT IF SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED GO BIZ CAN BECOME A SELF FUNDED PROGRAM AB TEN TWENTY SEVEN ALLOWS MORE TAXPAYERS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CALIFORNIA COMPETES TAX CREDIT PROGRAM AND ALLOWS THE STATE TO FUND FUTURE INVESTMENTS. FINALLY I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT WE WILL BE TAKING THE COMMITTEES RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS AN APPROPRIATION FOR TIMING PURPOSE -- THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE [inaudible] SIERRA. SEE NON QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. XENON MADAM CHAIR WE JUST FOLLOW THEIR QUESTION I WILL. RETIREMENT MORAL. OFFER VOTE THANK YOU YEAH. FILE ITEM. FOR THIS MCCARTY MISTER GALLAGHER PROJECT OPEN OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I PRESENT TO YOU AB FOURTEEN SIXTY EIGHT ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUE HERE ASSEMBLY MEMBER JAMES GALLAGHER. IT'S NOT TOO OFTEN THAT HE AND I PERCENT BILLS -- TOGETHER BUT THIS TALKS ABOUT. THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS ISSUE IN BRINGING -- BIPARTISAN SAYS TO SUPPORT TO THIS ISSUE TODAY. THIS IS ABOUT THE OPIOID PREVENTION AND REHABILITATION ACT AND COMING TOGETHER TO TACKLE FUNDING FOR THE CRISIS FACING OUR STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF FOR FOR WORKING WITH US AND WENT TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT. I THINK IT'S JUST ONE OF THEM CORRECT YES THANK YOU AND SO JUST WANT TO CLARIFY -- WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH THESE LATEST AMENDMENT -- WE CLARIFY THAT OPIOID SOLD DISTRIBUTED IN THE STATE I WOULD NOT BE DOUBLE COUNTED -- WE REDUCE THE GOAL TO FIND FROM ONE HUNDRED MILLION TO I THINK A MORE -- RESPONSIBLE NUMBER OF FIFTY MILLION WE CLARIFIED THE PENALTIES ARE REDUCE THEM TO MAKE SURE THE NOT -- TO BURDENSOME ON OUR SMALL BUSINESSES AND WE HAD LANGUAGE THAT CLARIFY THAT IS IF THERE ARE LESS OPIOID SOLD THE STATE AND THE TOTAL AMOUNT THE FUND. THE FUND WOULD ALSO BE REDUCED PROPORTIONALLY. AND LASTLY WE CLARIFIED THAT IF THERE IS A STATE SETTLEMENT ON OKAY NO THAT'S I'M SORRY THAT WOULD BE FOR THE THAT'S DOWN THE ROAD WE CLARIFY THAT FUNDS WILL BE GRANTED ON APPLICATION BASIS TO COUNTIES A NONPROFIT COMMUNITY BASED. CLINICS -- BASED UPON NEED NOT JUST GOING OUT TO COUNTIES THESE AMENDMENTS WERE ADDED BASED UPON THE CONCERNS THAT WE HEARD FROM -- THE OPPOSITION SO IT IN SOME THAT THIS IS BASED ON THE NOTION THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN PRODUCTS IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THERE IS A NEGATIVE EXTERNALITY BORN. WE KNOW ABOUT THIS WHEN YOU BUY A MATTRESS -- TV BATTERIES YOU PAY INTO A STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM. AS CONSUMERS WE SUPPORT UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF PAYING FOR THESE NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS BRING TO THE ENVIRONMENT AT THE SAME MENTALITY OR BRING TO THIS MEASURE. THIS BILL REQUIRE THE MANUFACTURERS OF COURSE WHOLESALERS THE SELLER DISTRIBUTE OPENS IN CALIFORNIA. REPORT THE NUMBERS OF HOW MUCH ARE SOLD TO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THEN PAY INTO THE FUND BASED UPON THEIR MARKET SHARE. WE KNOW ABOUT THE CASUALTIES OF THE NEED FOR THIS THE NUMBERS ARE ALARMING THE EPIDEMIC IMPACTS ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. THE NUMBER OF OF COURSE -- OVERDOSES AND GAS AND IMPACTS ON FAMILIES BUT ALSO THE IMPACTED TAXPAYERS WE KNOW THAT. EVERY TIME INDIVIDUAL GOES TO AN E. R. THAT'S ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY IT'S BORN UPON THE TAXPAYER TO PAY FOR THIS. AND THIS -- PROPOSALS BASED UPON THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT TODAY WERE ALL PAYING FOR IT BUT IT SHOULDN'T LARGELY BE BORN ON THE BACKS OF TAXPAYERS. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE INDUSTRY MUST STEP UP AND BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION. A COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE ARE FILING LAWSUITS AGAINST MANUFACTURES NORTH WHOLESALERS TO FOCUS ON ACCOUNTABILITY. THIS TO BE ANOTHER -- MEASURE -- WE'RE PROUD OF OUR CURRENT STATEWIDE EFFORTS TO DRAW DOWN A FEDERAL FUNDING TO FIGHT THIS EPIDEMIC BUT AS OUR WITNESSES WILL TESTIFY. A MORE IS NEEDED PLUS THE FEDERAL MONEY WILL EXPIRE IN TWENTY TWENTY THE YEAR THE REVENUES FROM THIS MEASURE COME INTO A FAX A VERY TIMELY. WE NEED A FINANCIAL PLAN TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR CURRENT EFFORTS -- THIS MEASURE WILL PROVIDE OUR CLINICS IN PROVIDERS WITH CRITICAL RESOURCES NEEDED AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTES BUT FIRST LET ME ALLOW. MY A JOINT AUTHOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER TO PRESENT. CAN CAN WE JUST PAUSE FOR A MINUTE WE HAVE A QUORUM MISS HAVING WE CALL THE ROLL -- GROW. CHU GRAY MAYES. WELL IN THIS [inaudible] MULLIN [inaudible] PETRIE-NORRIS [inaudible] QUIRK. RIVAS HERE KING. WE HAVE A QUORUM THIS GALLAGHER OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- YOU KNOW AS AS WE ALL KNOW IN THIS ROOM THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC IS A PRESSING PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT REALLY THROUGHOUT THE NATION AND THIS IS SOMETHING IS BEING TALKED ABOUT AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. DRUG TEST ESPECIALLY THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH PRESCRIPTION OPIOID DRUGS ARE RISING FASTER THAN EVER. AND ARE NOW THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG AMERICANS UNDER THE AGE OF FIFTY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN A LONG. SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE DIED FROM DRUG OVERDOSES THIS IS THE LARGEST ANNUAL JUMP EVER. RECORDED THESE NUMBERS ARE STAGGERING. AND I'M HERE TO GIVE YOU A PERSPECTIVE FROM FROM THE RURAL AREAS HOW THIS IS IMPACTING US -- IT'S ESPECIALLY HITTING RURAL PARTS OF CALIFORNIA VERY HARD -- DRUG OVERDOSE DEATHS ARE ALSO THE MOST COMMON IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SOME REAL COUNTIES HAVE MORE OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS. THAN PEOPLE. IN BUTTE COUNTY ALONE THERE OVER THIRTEEN HUNDRED PRESCRIPTIONS PER ONE THOUSAND RESIDENTS. SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH -- WE HAVE A AND M. M. E. RATE -- AT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED PER RESIDENT ANNUALLY THE NATIONAL AVERAGE IS. SIX HUNDRED FORTY SO WE ARE DEALING WITH A HUGE CRISIS ON OUR HANDS AND AND RIGHT NOW AND THE REASON WHY I HAVE COME ON IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AND WHY I THINK IS DESPERATELY NEEDED IS MY LOCALS ARE THE ONES WHO ARE HOLDING THIS BURDEN ALONE -- IT'S IT'S MY IT'S MY SHERIFF'S IT'S MY HEALTH PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS IT'S MY HOSPITALS -- THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST OVER OVERDOSE ADMISSION RATES -- THAT IS COSTING EVERYBODY MORE MONEY AND ALL I'M REALLY ASKING FOR ALL THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS THAT THE MANUFACTURERS WHO HELPED CREATE THIS CRISIS. BE PART OF THE SOLUTION -- AND THAT'S WHAT AB FOURTEEN SIXTY EIGHT TRULY DOESN'T ABOUT PUNISHING ANYBODY. IT'S ABOUT SAYING TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS FOR THIS CRISIS THAT WERE ALL THAT WELL FACING WE'VE ALL GOT SKIN IN THE GAME AND WE'VE WE'VE PASSED LAWS TO GET OUT PRESCRIPTIONS. AND TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUES THE ABUSES WE WERE SEEN AMONG DOCTORS AND OTHERS RIGHT WE WE HAVE WE HAVE TRIED TO EXPAND -- THE ABILITY TO PRESCRIBE. MEDICATIONS THAT WILL HELP GET PEOPLE OFF OF OPIOIDS -- WE TRY TO REMOVE THOSE BARRIERS BUT WE NEED THE FUNDING. FEDERAL FUNDING HAS STARTED TO DWINDLE OFF FOR THIS WE'RE GONNA NEED THE FUN IN LONG TERM TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE TREATMENT. NOW THERE'S A SPOKEN HUB. MODEL THIS WORKING VERY WELL BUT IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO NEED FUNDING GOING FORWARD SO AGAIN THIS IS A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR FUND NOW WE'VE WE'VE MADE THAT AMENDMENT -- THEY WERE TRYING THAT WE'RE SEEKING TO GET THE MANUFACTURERS TO BE TO BE PART OF WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH INDUSTRY. AND ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TO TRY AND GET REAL SOLUTIONS HERE -- AND SO YOU KNOW I JUST ASK FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION UNDERSTANDING THAT THE THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THAT WE HAVE ON OUR HANDS -- AND THAT THAT REALLY WE NEED THE RESOURCES WE ARE TOTALLY. ELIZA NEVER RESOURCE WE HAVE AVAILABLE AND AND IT IS VERY TOUGH AND I DO HAVE A WITH US TODAY TO HELP TESTIFY ARE ARE COUNTY SHERIFF -- FROM BUTTE COUNTY. COR HONEY SHOULD BE JOIN US AS WELL. I'M NOT SURE IF COME ON UP. HI WITNESSES THANK YOU FOR JOINING US WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU -- THE COMMITTEE APPRECIATE IT AS YOU KNOW MY NAME IS COREY HOW AND THE SHERIFF OF YOU COUNTY AND I'M A SUPPORT THIS BILL. JUST AS A QUICK FAQ IS IN A OF OF THINGS DO. A RECENT STUDY BIãU CAN IS THE FIFTH WORST OPIATE OVERDOSE DEATH RATE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM AND NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT ARE. NOT CREATE A PROBLEM -- WE NOW ARE STARTING TO SEE A FICTITIOUS OXYCONTIN PILLS MADE OUT OF FENNEL. ARE BEING BROUGHT INTO THE COUNTY AND I THINK THAT ILLUSTRATES. HOW SIGNIFICAN THE PROBLEM IS? ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO PROVIDE TREATMENT TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ADDICTED THIS I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL AND SO THAT'S WHY I'M IN SUPPORT OF IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT [inaudible] THANKS. A GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW THE WHOLE CENTER PERSPECTIVE ON A. B. FOURTEEN SIXTY EIGHT MY NAME IS ALLEY PRETENDS AND I'M THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF QUALITY AT THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION. THE STATE RIGHT ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA'S THIRTEEN HUNDRED COMMUNITY CLINICS AND HEALTH CENTERS THAT PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY COMPREHENSIVE CARE TO SIX POINT NINE MILLION CALIFORNIANS EACH YEAR. WE ARE IS PROUD TO SUPPORT AB FOURTEEN SIXTY EIGHT AND WE BELIEVE THAT ALL PLAN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO EXPAND TREATMENT FOR OPIOID USE DISORDER. THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC CONTINUES TO DEVASTATE CALIFORNIA ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH 70% OF OPIOID RELATED OVERDOSE DEATHS IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN INVOLVED PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA HEALTH CENTERS ARE DEEPLY INVESTED IN EXPANDING ACCESS TO TREATMENT FOR A PURE DOES USE DISORDER INCLUDING EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES LIKE INTEGRATED MEDICATIONS IS TO TREATMENT OR AM. EIGHTEEN WHICH COMBINES MEDICATIONS COMPLEMENTED BY A RANGE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTERVENTIONS. AND HEALTH CENTERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE AMONG THE PRIMARY PROVIDERS OF OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS IS TO TREATMENT. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN HEALTH CENTERS OF NEARLY DOUBLED THE NUMBER OF CLINICIANS LICENSE TO PRESCRIBE MEDICINES. FOR OPIOID ADDICTION YES HEALTH CENTERS CONTINUE TO FACE CHALLENGES IN SUSTAINING THE SERVICES WITH EXISTING PAYMENT STRUCTURES. THE REMIX REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM IS SIMPLY NOT DESIGNED FOR THE INTENSIVE CARE MANAGEMENT FAMILY SUPPORT AND COMMUNITY PREVENTION AND EDUCATION THAT IS NEEDED. HEALTH CENTERS RELY ON GRANTS TO SUSTAIN THE SUPPORT OF STAFF AND SERVICES NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE OUTCOMES. THE HIGH COST BUT LOW REIMBURSEMENT IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE TO THE FULL ADOPTION OF MHC ACROSS THE STATE. AB FOURTEEN SIXTY EIGHT BY CREATING THE OPIATE PREVENTION AND REHABILITATION PROGRAM FUND WILL PROVIDE A MECHANISM TO SUSTAINABLE ONGOING FUNDING TO CONTINUE AND EXPAND LOCAL EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE OPIOID CRISIS. THROUGH COMPETITIVE GRANTS TO HIGH NEED COMMUNITIES FURTHERMORE THE INFORMATION PROPOSED TO BE DISCLOSED BY THE MANUFACTURER OR WHOLESALER AS OUTLINED IN THIS ACT. WOULD BE INVALUABLE TO UNDERSTANDING THE AVAILABILITY OF PROBLEMATIC OPIOIDS. WE CAN UNDERSTAND OR MEETING FULLY IT TACKLE THE SCOPE OF THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE BREATH OF THE SUPPLY CHAINS IMPACT. IT IS FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY ON AB. FOURTEEN SIXTY EIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS -- TOM RENT FREE WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION I'M NOT GONNA REPEAT THE THE STATEMENTS MADE BY THE AUTHORS ABOUT THE EXTENT OF THE OPIOID CRISIS YOU ALL KNOW HOW IT'S DEVASTATING YOUR COMMUNITIES. I WOULD JUST SAY THAT -- ONE ADD ONE THING THAT ACCORDING TO THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION THREE OUT OF FOUR HEROIN USERS BEGAN THEIR ADDICTION BY MISS USING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. DESPITE THE CLAIMS MADE BY SOME COMPANIES THAT THESE OPIOID -- PRESCRIPTIONS ARE NON ADDICTIVE THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE ESTIMATES THAT UP 225% OF PEOPLE WHO BEGIN USING PRESCRIPTION PAIN PILLS OVER THE LONG TERM BECOME ADDICTED TO THESE MEDICATIONS. ARE IN OUR WHAT IT WANTED JUST ADDRESS QUICKLY ONE AND STATEMENT THAT WAS MADE IN THE ANALYSIS ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF FEDERAL FUNDING AND YES CALIFORNIA HAS RECEIVED. MONEY THROUGH THE FEDERAL CURES ACT. THESE ARE GRANT FUNDS THAT HAVE COME THAT HAVE ENABLED US TO ESTABLISH A HUB AND SPOKE -- A MODEL SYSTEM FOR PCA FOR EXPANDING ACCESS TO MEDICATIONS FOR ADDICTION TREATMENT -- IN IN MANY AREAS OF CALIFORNIA AND YET -- IT'S FAR FROM CERTAIN THAT THIS FEDERAL FUNDING IS GOING TO CONTINUE THE PROBLEM WITH FEDERAL GRANTS -- WELL WELL WE APPRECIATE THE MONEY IT'S IT'S IT'S THAT INEVITABLY WHEN THIS -- MONEY GOES AWAY AND THIS IS TRUE THIS IS TIME LIMITED THEN THESE PROGRAMS HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TO SHOW THAT THEY CAN SUSTAIN BE SUSTAINED OTHERWISE IF IF THE GRANT MONEY GOES AWAY. AND THEY CAN'T BE SUSTAINED AND THEN WE LOSE THOSE PROGRAMS AND THAT WOULD BE REALLY UNFORTUNATE SO WE THINK THAT FUNDING AVAILABLE THROUGH THIS. THROUGH THIS BILL WOULD BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THESE GOOD PROGRAMS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT -- NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE. AND I'M CHAIR MEMBERS ROBERT HARRIS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE. THIS IS A LONG TERM PROBLEM THIS IS A LONG TERM SOLUTION ONCE PEOPLE ARE ADDICTED THEY DON'T GET OVER RIGHT AWAY. SO. WE WANT TO CONTINUE GIVING THE TREATMENT SO THAT PEOPLE GET. CLEAN AND SOBER.

TEST BY AMERICA. WHAT DOES HOLD ON ONE SECOND WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS LET -- THESE FOLKS TESTIFY AND THEN WE'LL WE'LL TAKE YOU IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE [inaudible] GO AHEAD. CHAIRMAN BURKE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LEAH LINDAHL AND THE SENIOR DIRECTOR OF STATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR THE HEALTH CARE DISTRIBUTION ALLIANCE. A SHE IS THE NATIONAL TRADE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING PRIMARY PHARMACEUTICAL WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTORS -- WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTORS ARE THE VITAL LINK IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN CONNECTING PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS TO ROUGHLY SEVENTEEN THOUSAND POINTS OF CARE SO PHARMACIES HOSPITALS NURSING HOMES. HOSPICE CENTERS THAT CENTER ACROSS CALIFORNIA -- WE'RE HERE TODAY AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO ASSEMBLY BILL. FOURTEEN SIXTY EIGHT THE LEGISLATION AS A MODELED AFTER NEW YORK FATHER WAS RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL IT WOULD CREATE AN ARBITRARY FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS SURCHARGE ON PHYSICIAN PRESCRIBE OPIOID TREATMENT THE MEDICATION. IN THE FEDERAL JUDGE'S DECISION IT WAS MADE CLEAR THE PLACING A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL ASSESSMENT UNLIKELY ORDERED AND PRESCRIBE MEDICATIONS AS ILL CONCEIVED. AND COULD WILL REDUCE THE AVAILABILITY OF OPIOID MEDICATIONS FOR THOSE WHO CRITICALLY NEED THEM -- THE SURCHARGE TARGETS MEDICATIONS NOT JUST DOWN IN MEDICS MEDICINE CABINETS BUT ALSO THOSE NEEDED BY PATIENTS UNDER THE CARE OF LICENSE MEDICAL PROVIDERS. INCLUDING THOSE UNDERGOING SURGICAL PROCEDURES CANCER PATIENTS SEEKING TO REDUCE PAIN. INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING END OF LIFE CARE -- IN THOSE OF DEBILITATING PAINFUL CONDITIONS WHO ARE TRYING TO LIVE A NORMAL EVERYDAY LIFE HOW FOR EXAMPLE LIKE A MOTHER GOING INTO IT -- LABOR AND DELIVERY AND THAT BUT DURRELL IS AN OPIOID PRODUCT THAT WOULD INCREASE IN COST -- ULTIMATELY LIVING A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL ASSESSMENT ON OPIOID PRODUCTS WOULD IMPOSE A COSTLY BURDEN ON THE PHARMACEUTICAL SUPPLY CHAIN AND ON THE PATIENTS PROVIDERS AND PHARMACIES. AND WHICH IT SERVICE THE PROPOSAL DOES NOTHING TO ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE EPIDEMIC. AND NORMAL TO DECREASE THE NUMBER OF OPIOIDS IT WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SUPPLY CHAIN AND INSTEAD RAISES THE COST BASED ON THE CURRENT DEMAND. BASIC ECONOMICS IN THE RECENT COURT DECISION OVERTURNED THE NEW YORK Là CONCLUDED THAT COST INCREASES IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND SHE WILL INEVITABLY BE SHARED BY CONSUMERS. AT THE TIME WHEN CALIFORNIA'S MAKING MANY POLICY STEPS TO ADDRESS THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. IT SEEMS COUNTER PRODUCTIVE TO PLACE A NOTABLE SO ON THE SAME PRODUCTS WERE TRYING TO CONTROL COSTS OF SO IT'S J. THEREFORE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT YOU OPPOSE THE LEGISLATION ADDITIONAL. AFTERNOON MANAGER MEMBERS PROMOTION WITH THE ASSOCIATION FOR ACCESSIBLE MEDICINES AM REPRESENTS THE GENERIC. AND BIOSIMILAR MANUFACTURERS -- WE'RE ALSO POSED A A A MEMBERS ARE ACUTELY AWARE OF THE ADDICTIVE NATURE OF THESE PRODUCTS -- IS PRECISELY THESE REASONS THAT THERE IS A HIGHER LEVEL OF SCRUTINY APPLY TO THEM BY THE FDA AND THEY ARE HIGHLY REGULATED ALSO BY THE D. E. A.. EIGHTY A MEMBER SUPPORT THIS OVERSIGHT [inaudible] AND AND THE RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT HIM THEY HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE I THINK. ONE OF THE THINGS FOR THE GENERIC MANUFACTURERS -- IS THE MARKET PLACES CHANGED SINCE THIS REALLY BECAME A CRISIS. IN WHAT. MOST OF THE LAWSUITS THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED -- ARE TYPICALLY THE THE PHARMACISTS THE ARMS AND THE BRAND MANY FACTORS THAT ARE NAMED. AMERICAN FACTORS NOW MAKE ABOUT ARMS ARE ABOUT 90% OF ALL THE PRESCRIPTIONS NOW OR ARE GENERIC. SO THE MARKET PLACES MOVED FROM WHAT WAS A BRAND PRODUCT. GENERIC MANUFACTURERS DON'T MARKET. THEY DID NOT DO DIRECTOR PRESCRIBER -- DETAILING. THEN IT'S TRULY THE ACCESS FOR PATIENTS WHO ARE IN NEED BECAUSE THESE ARE IMPORTANT PRODUCTS FOR MANY MANY PATIENTS. WHETHER IT'S END OF LIFE CARE CANCER -- INTRACTABLE PAIN MANY PATIENTS STILL NEED THESE. AND BECAUSE OPIATES ARE NOW A VERY. HIGH -- VERY LOW MARGIN PRODUCT BUT RELY ON A HIGH VOLUME. THE FEES THAT COULD BE CHARGED -- ACCORDING TO THIS BILL ARE OFTEN GOING TO BE MORE THAN MANUFACTURERS ACTUALLY MAKE AN REVENUE ONE MANUFACTURES DURING THE NEW YORK -- CASE IT'S BEEN BEEN REFERENCED A COUPLE OF TIMES TESTIFIED THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE FEE WAS TRULY MORE THAN. THE REVENUE. WHEN THAT HAPPENS IN ANY INDUSTRY IN ANY PRODUCT? MANUFACTURER CAN NOT STAY IN BUSINESS. AND THAT'S WHAT IS GOING TO REDUCE THE ACCESS OR INCREASE THE COST FOR THOSE WHO DO REMAIN. WITHIN. THE THIS MARKET PLACE THE WAY THAT THE BILL IS STRUCTURED IF ANYONE MANUFACTURER PULLS OUT. THEN HE OTHER MANUFACTURERS THAT ARE LEFT ARE GONNA BE HIRING PAYING A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF OF THE FEE. BECAUSE OF THOSE REASONS THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO DRIVE EITHER THE COSTS OF WAR THE ACCESS DOWN. NOT ALL PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE MANUFACTURERS EITHER SOME OF THEM -- ESPECIALLY -- INJECTABLE MEDICINES AT HOSPITALS. ONLY HAVE ONE OR TWO MANUFACTURERS AND WHEN THE THE COSTS OF PAYING THIS FEE OR TAX. GO UP IS GOING TO BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THOSE MANUFACTURERS TO REMAIN IN THE MARKETING CALIFORNIA. ALSO THIS IS A NATIONAL MARKETPLACE WE DON'T SELL. PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO CALIFORNIA WE SELL PRIMARILY TO THREE WHOLESALERS WHO. PURCHASED 90% OF ALL GENERIC DRUGS. WE DON'T CONTROL THE AS MANUFACTURERS WHERE THOSE GO WE DON'T NECESSARILY EVEN KNOW THEY'VE THEM WITH THE MANUFACTURE THE WHOLESALERS -- REQUEST A CERTAIN NUMBER OF UNITS THAT'S WHERE WE SELL THEM SO WE DON'T NECESSARILY A DIRECT THEM INTO CALIFORNIA. WE DON'T MARKET THEM WITHIN -- WE DON'T PRESCRIBE THEM WE'RE NOT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT LIMIT THE ALTERNATIVE CARE OR TREATMENT MODALITIES THAT MANY PATIENTS COULD FACE -- AND AND BECAUSE OF THOSE REASONS -- WORRY OR IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION NAME AND AFFILIATION. COME ON UP. THANK YOU LORRAINE JOSEPH DOBSON AND I RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE A. B. FOURTEEN SIXTY EIGHT I'M NOT ELDER CARE SPECIALIST.

COST INCREASES -- FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX WILL BE BORNE BY THE HOSPICE PROGRAMS AND WILL COMPROMISE THE CARE IS PROVIDED THE TERMLY ELEANOR AND UNHAPPILY OPPOSED. THINK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MACHAR RIVAS WITH THE CALIFORNIA PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION ALSO IN OPPOSITION WHILE WE APPRECIATE WHAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS FOR TRYING TO DO WE DO BELIEVE THAT PHARMACISTS WILL BEAR THE COST OF THIS TAX AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR NO BOAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. JUST IN REGARDS TO I VOTED NO ON THIS -- IN HEALTH COMMITTEE COURSES IS REVENUE TAX -- AND HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS OVER THE WEEKEND. AND I STRUGGLE A LOT -- WITH -- THESE THINGS FROM A PHILOSOPHICAL PERSPECTIVE WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS. A VOTED NO ON THE TOBACCO TAX -- EVEN THOUGH I DON'T LIKE TOBACCO -- PAID THE DIDN'T SUPPORT THE SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGE TAX ON EVEN THOUGH I KNOW THE INCREDIBLE DAMAGE. OTHER THAT SAID DOING TO TO TO PUBLIC HEALTH. AND WE KNOW THE IMPACT THAT BOMB THAT OPIOIDS ARE HAVING ON OUR SOCIETY. AND SO THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE IS IF IT'S NOT A TAX TO BE ABLE TO BRING IN SOME REVENUE TO BE ABLE. TO HELP FUND SOME PROGRAMS AND WHAT IS THE ANSWER CITY OPPOSITION THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE HERE SPEAKING FOR THE OPPOSITION WHAT IS THE ANSWER -- TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE BECAUSE IT IS HAVING A MAJOR IMPACT. ON PEOPLE'S LIVES AND AT SOME LEVEL I THINK THOSE WHO ARE PRODUCING OF THIS PRODUCT THERE IS SOME LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY THAT'S THERE. SO IF NOT THIS THEN WHAT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. IT'S A A. M. -- DOES BELIEVE OBVIOUSLY THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THIS -- A. M. HAS SUPPORTED ELEMENTS -- PERSON. LIMITS ON THE PRESCRIBING -- AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE THE CONTROL OF WHERE THESE DRUGS COME FROM THE MANUFACTURERS SIMPLY FILL ORDERS [inaudible] AND WHILE. THE NUMBER OF DRUGS THAT ARE ARE BEING -- SOLD OR DISTRIBUTED OR OR PASSED THROUGH PHARMACIES. THEY ALL TAKE A PRESCRIPTION -- THERE'S EDUCATION OF THE PHYSICIANS OR THE PRESCRIBER SEWER WRITING THE DRUGS. ADDITIONAL EDUCATION OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TAKING THE DRUGS. HOW TO DISPOSE OF THEM PROPERLY? HELL. TO NOT TAKE THEM BEYOND WHAT THEIR PHYSICIAN ORDERS ARE -- WHETHER IT'S THAT THE USE OF PDM PEAS TO STOP ANY OF THE ILLEGAL -- DISTRIBUTION WHETHER IT COMES FROM THE MANUFACTURER FROM THE WHOLESALER -- BEING STOLEN FROM A PILL MILK OR FROM A PHARMACY OR PATIENTS WHO ARE DOCTOR SHOPPING. SO THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT STEPS OUR CONCERN AGAIN IS JUST THE WAY THAT THAT THIS FEE IS STRUCTURED NOT THAT. THERE'S NOT A PROBLEM. BUT THE WAY THAT THAT THE TAXES IS BEING DONE AND WILL FOCUS ON WE BELIEVE ON THE ON THE ON THE MANUFACTURER'S EVEN THOUGH. AGAIN WE'RE JUST FILLING IN ORDER THAT THAT'S BASED ON A NATIONAL LEVEL SALE -- SO WE DON'T EVEN CONTROL WE DON'T KNOW THE PHARMACY THAT. IS -- PERHAPS PRESCRIBING -- OR I'M SORRY DISTRIBUTING MORE PILLS THEN THERE ARE PEOPLE WITHIN THE TOWN OR THE PHYSICIAN THAT'S WRITING. UP MORE SCRIPTS THAN PATIENTS IN THE REGION -- AND THOSE ARE OTHER ASPECTS THAT CAN BE DONE IN ARE BEING DONE -- AND THROUGHOUT THE NATION REALLY -- TO HELP ADDRESS THE PROBLEM BUT SIMPLY PUTTING A TAX ON A PRODUCT JUST IS GOING TO INCREASE THE COST OF THE PRODUCT AND FOR CLARIFICATION SOME LIMITING BILLS HAVE NOT MADE IT OUT OF THIS HOUSE IN THE LAST TWO YEARS SO LIKE PRESCRIPTION LIMITS FOR CHILDREN WAS NOT. DID IT MAKE IT OUT OF THE SENATE LAST YEAR SO NOT ALL LIMITING BILLS AND NOT ARE ARE REALLY BEING PASSED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO FOR CLARITY FOR THE COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER PATRONIZE. FOLLOW UP QUESTION FOR YOU I'M DO YOU KNOW. SAID SO YOU'RE ASSOCIATION ACCESSIBLE MEDICINE DO YOU KNOW. HOW MUCH PROFIT YOUR MEMBERS MADE FROM THE SALE OF OPIATES IN? TWENTY EIGHTEEN YOU KNOW QUITE HONESTLY THAT'S ONE OF THE THE BENEFITS OF WORKING FOR AN ASSOCIATION IS I DO NOT NEED TO KNOW THAT AND I I HONESTLY I DON'T. I CAN SAY THAT WHICH IS ACTUALLY A VERY SMALL MARGIN ARM SORRY A SMALL PORTION OF THE BROADER -- GENERIC MARKET PLACE MANY MANUFACTURERS DON'T PARTICIPATE IN THE OPIOID MARKET AT ALL -- WE DO KNOW THAT THE NUMBER OF OF PILLS THAT ARE BEING DISTRIBUTED OR IT'S ACTUALLY CONTROLLED BY THE D. E. A. R. MANUFACTURERS CAN'T MAKE ANY MORE PILLS THAN WHAT THE D. E. A. AUTHORIZES EACH YEAR. THAT NUMBER'S BEEN DROPPING PRETTY PRECIPITOUSLY OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AS I RECALL IT'S ABOUT 25% LOWER THAN IT WAS A COUPLE YEARS AGO -- IT'S BUT AS FAR AS THE EXACT REVENUE NOW I DON'T KNOW -- BUT IT IS A SMALL MARGIN DRUGS -- MEANING THAT THERE'S MANY COMPETITORS MAKING THE EXACT SAME PRODUCT. OKAY. NOT NOT NECESSARILY YOUR GROUP OF THE ASSOCIATION MEMBERS BUT AS A WHOLE THE INDUSTRY IS MAKING AND HAS MADE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IS THAT CORRECT -- I I I CAN'T ANSWER THAT WITH ENOUGH CLARITY -- YOU KNOW WE CAN LOOK INTO IT BUT I I THINK I WOULD GO BACK TO MY COMMENTS EARLIER THAT THE MARKET PLACES CHANGE PRETTY PRECIPITOUSLY. SINCE THE BRANDS -- HAVE LOST PATENT PROTECTION AND IT HAS BECOME PRIMARILY A GENERIC PRODUCT. OKAY AND THAT WAS TO MY PROFIT SIDE OF THE QUESTION. DON'T ASK MUCH ABOUT THAT THE COST SO THEY WE ALL KNOW THAT. THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC IS EXACT IS AT EXACT TEAM. TREMENDOUS HUMAN CALL. AND WOULD YOU ALSO AGREE THAT IT IS EXACTING A TREMENDOUS FINANCIAL TOLL. ON CALIFORNIAN CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. YEAH I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DISCREPANCY ON THAT -- I THINK PART OF THE QUESTION THOUGH IT REMAINS AND I THINK THE SHERIFF ACTUALLY BROUGHT IT UP THE FACT THAT THE USE OF OF ILLEGAL FENNEL. AND NOT FROM PRESCRIBED DRUGS IS ON THE RISE AND THAT IS ONE OF THE MAIN AREAS THAT I THINK NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN THIS BILL WILL DO NOTHING. TO ADDRESS THE INCREASED USE OF OF FENNEL THAT IS NOT COMING THROUGH THE NORMAL DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL THERE HAVE BEEN LAWSUITS -- AND THOSE IN ON OUR VIEW SHOULD CONTINUE -- WHETHER IT'S AGAINST THE PILL MILLS THE PHYSICIANS WHO ARE OVER PRESCRIBING OR IF THERE ARE MANUFACTURERS THAT OR OR DISTRIBUTING THEM THAT'S THE APPROPRIATE VENUE BUT AGAIN I DON'T THINK THAT. TAXING THIS PRODUCT IS REALLY GOING TO END UP REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF DRUGS THAT IS COMING THROUGH THE LEGAL. PRESCRIPTION SUPPLY CHAIN. BUT I THINK I AGREE WITH YOU THAT THERE'S THERE'S MUCH THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE THE SPACING I THINK. THE OBJECT OF THIS SPELL IS TO RAISE SOME RESOURCES TO FIND DESPERATELY NEEDED TREATMENTS -- CONSERVE GETTING BACK TO MY QUESTION THINK THE ANSWER IS IT IS IT'S IT'S COSTING CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND I THINK TO THE AUTHOR'S POINT. IT'S REGULAR TAXPAYERS IT'S IT'S OUR CONSTITUENTS. YOU KNOW ALL ACROSS THE STATE WE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE PICKING UP THE TAB. AND YOU KNOW I THINK. MY COLLEAGUES TO THE RIGHT RAISE THE QUESTION ABOUT KIND OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL APPROACH AND THAT THIS IS BEEN A TOUGH ONE FOR ME AS WELL SO I'M PRO BUSINESS AND PRO TAX PAYER. I LOOK VERY CLOSELY AT THE IDEA OF ANY ADDITIONAL FEE BUT I THINK. THAT I'M WHEN I LOOK AT THE THE TOLL THAT IS BEING EXACTED -- ALL ACROSS. YOU KNOW MY COMMUNITY ALL ACROSS THE STATE. AND IT FEELS TO ME LIKE. MY TAXPAYERS OF MY CONSTITUENTS ARE THE ONLY ONES WERE REPAIRING THE BIRD AND I DO FEEL LIKE THE INDUSTRY. NEEDS TO STEP UP AND THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT EVERYONE. IN THE INDUSTRY IS IN A BEEN A BAD ACTOR BUT NO. WHETHER IT'S BEEN THROUGH HAPPENSTANCE OR OR OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW MORE NEFARIOUS. THERE HAS BEEN A CRISIS IT'S BEEN CREATED AND I I DO THINK THAT THE INDUSTRY NEEDS TO COME TO THE TABLE INTERNIST AND I'VE FOR THAT REASON YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THIS. IT'S A PERFECT PIECE OF LEGISLATION BUT I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY AND HAVE NO ONE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE CAN MOVE THIS FORWARD SO THAT WE CAN. CAN HAVE A SERIOUS CONVERSATION AT ALL THE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE BECAUSE THE BOTTOM LINE IS EVERYTHING YOU TALKED ABOUT. IN A BETTER EDUCATION BETTER ENFORCEMENT. THAT STUFF COSTS MONEY AND RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS ARE THE ONES HE'S PAYING FOR IT AND WE NEED. WE NEED HELP TO GET THIS GET THIS DONE [inaudible] MR GREAT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AND THANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS OR BRING IN FORWARD. AN INTERESTING TOPIC AND I'LL CERTAINLY GIVE YOU ACCOLADES FOR THE BOTH OF YOU HAVE -- LOBBIED ME HEAVILY. ON THIS BILL AND MADE -- BEEN GOOD ADVOCATES FOR YOUR ISSUE -- THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH I WANT TO COVER HONESTLY -- YOUR WHATEVER LOOK AT BILL IT'S KIND OF THE THREE BASIC TENETS LIKE IS THERE A PROBLEM. I THINK WE CAN EASILY ANSWER THAT QUESTION -- IN THIS CASE IS A HUGE PROBLEM. IS A PROBLEM GOVERNMENT COULD SOLVE. CERTAINLY I THINK GOVERNMENT'S ROLE. DOES THE BILL PROPOSED HAVE ANY OF THOSE SOLUTIONS ANDRIGHT THAT'S THE THIRD QUESTION AND YOUR STRIKES ME. IT MAY THIS COULD BE A PIECE OF THE PROBLEM I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK THIS IS THE ENTIRE PUZZLE. FOR NINETEEN YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN AROUND THIS INSTITUTION. ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY. SHOW UP IN A TO SOME DEGREE CRY POOR MOUTH. I SAW YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE ALMOST BROKE OTHER THAN THE PHARMACOGNOSY SAY WERE MAKING LOTS OF MONEY BUT WE NEED FOR OUR DE. EVERYBODY ELSE IS GOING BROKE MEANWHILE WE SPEND MORE ON HEALTH CARE PER CAPITA THAN MOST OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD. WHEN WE VOTED LAST YEAR? ON SB SEVENTY IN THE THE TRANSPARENCY BILL. YOUR VARIETY OF THE STAKEHOLDERS IN THAT WROTE LETTERS TO MY OFFICE. ARGUING THAT -- IS -- KAISER PERMANENTE. OUR ARGUE THE MUCH THE GREATEST THREATS AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE IS THE FIRM'S CORNISH PRICING OF NEW AND EXISTING MEDICATION -- LEADING TO HIGHER COSTS -- ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS TO RISING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS HAVE BEEN SIZE A MAJOR DRIVER OF PREMIUM INCREASE WE GO ON AND ON AND ON AND ASK THE SERVER ARE WE SETTING OURSELVES UP FOR ANOTHER. COST DRIVER AND THE WHAT WE BALANCE IN THAT WITH IN YOU KNOW OTHER LEGISLATION BECAUSE THE END IF WE ALL AGREE OF GOTTA GET HEALTH CARE COSTS REDUCED RIGHT -- IN THE CASE OF PREDICTION AND LAST THE AUTHORS. GUILD CURRENTLY HOUSES THAT COVERED BETWEEN MEDICARE HEALTH MEDICARE AND PRIVATE INSURANCE IS EVERYONE HAVE COVERAGE ON PREDICTION. ON I HOPE YOU A TREATMENT -- DICTION TREATMENT YEAH. I CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION. SOME OF THE CLINICS OTHER PROVIDERS CAN TELL YOU BUT I I WILL SAY THAT. FOR FOR THE COST IF YOU'RE GETTING A PAIN CLING THAT SICK PRETTY CLEAR. 195% OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AFTER THE FOUR WHEEL CARE ACT. HAVE SOME TYPE OF INSURANCE MAN I'LL BE ALWAYS BE ABLE SEE IF PROVIDERS AS YOU KNOW. BUT WHEN THEY GET A PRESCRIPTION THEY HAVE A COPAY SO TO TRADITIONAL COPAY TWENTY BUCKS SO 95% OF PEOPLE. WHO ARE UTILIZING THAT MENTIONED EARLIER? A MOM WHO GOES IN FOR LABOR DELIVERY CELL 95% OF PEOPLE IN THAT SITUATION ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE. THEIR THEIR THEIR MEDICINE PROVIDED FOR THEM. AND WE BORN WITHIN THE COPAY AND I WILL NOTE THAT A LOT OF TALK TODAY ABOUT PASSED THROUGH. THE PEOPLE THAT. THERE ARE IT IN INTO THE ROAD OF THAT COAT THERE THE INSURANCE FOLKS. AND THEY'RE NOT HERE IN OPPOSITION SO THIS REALLY IS I THINK MORE OF THE PHILOSOPHIC ARGUED SOME PEOPLE OPPOSE BECAUSE TWENTY THREE MILLION PRESCRIPTIONS A YEAR IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR FINE NO ROUGHLY -- TWO BUCKS PURSE PRESCRIPTION IS THAT GOING TO BREAK THE BANK I DON'T KNOW I THINK THAT IS A IS A PRICE TO PAY -- FOR ALL THE BILLIONS NOTED EARLIER THAT WE'RE PAYING CALIFORNIA TO PAY FOR THIS CRISIS. THE AGENCY RESPONSE I'D I DON'T. NEED IT TO KINDA LAMBERT ON THE QUESTION FURTHER. I REALIZE THAT FORMA AND KIND OF THE THE RICH PROFITS -- THAT THEY ENJOY IT TIMES HE IS A GOOD BOGEYMAN IN POLITICS. BUT THE PROBLEM SEEMS FAR MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT AND THAT. YOU'RE EVERYBODY'S GOT KIND OF A SEAT AT THE TABLE AND DRIVING COSTS UP AND EVERYBODY OUT OF THE SEAT AT THE TABLE DRIVE COSTS DOWN. AND THAT'S REALLY -- IN A WERE MIKE MY QUESTIONS REPORT AND WHAT ARE WE DOING TO ENSURE THAT. WE ARE EFFECTIVELY PROVIDING OVERSIGHT WE BEING THE LEGISLATURE -- THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHERS YEAH I READ IN THE ANALYSIS HERE AND THANK YOU TO THE STAFF FOR AND WELL DONE COMEDIAN HOUSES BUT IN THIS. TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN REPORTER THE STATE UNDER SAYING THAT. WE ARE WE'VE GOT FUNDS AT DID SHE ASKED AND PASS ON THE COUNTIES WERE WERE SITTING ON THE COUNTIES ARE SET ON TO EARN THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. WELL AND SO THAT WOULD ESTABLISH ANOTHER FUN FOR ANOTHER HUNDRED MILLION WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT'S THAT AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO SAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE COVERAGE AND CARE. UNLESS MAYBE YOU LIVE IN A RURAL YOU KNOW PART OF THE STATE WHERE THERE'S NOT THE PROVIDERS THE PROGRAMS RIGHT -- AND HOW ARE WE INSURING AGAIN THAT ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE I UNDERSTAND THE BILL HOW WE'RE ENSURING THAT -- THAT FOREIGN COUNTRIES HAVE SU TABLE AND FRANKLY I THINK THAT MAY BE AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD BUT I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK WE'VE GOT OUR ARMS AROUND THE ENTIRE THE PROBLEM OR THE ENTIRETY OF THE FOLKS THAT I TO BE AT THE TABLE. AND ALSO BECAUSE WE KEEP DEALING WITH THESE ISSUES IN SILOS. RATHER SIT DOWN AND PUT IN A REAL PACKAGE OF REFORM TOGETHER THAT KIND OF HOLDS EVERYBODY SPEAK TO THE FIRE JUST DOESN'T STRIKE ME AS THE RIGHT APPROACH IT WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE THERE. WHICH ALSO YEAH GOOD JUST HOW WE AMENDED IT AND THEN I WENT MISTER GALLAGHER TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT ON REAL. IS THAT WE HAD CONCERNS LIKE YOU IF YOU LOOK AT THE MENTAL HEALTH ACT THESE COUNTIES ARE SITTING ON MONEY SO WE DIDN'T WANT THE MONEY GOING OUT AS A PRIOR VERSION JUST TO COUNTIES BECAUSE THEY MAY JUST DO THAT. WE BROUGHT UP NOW SO -- CLINICS IN PROVIDERS IN YOUR COMMUNITIES CAN DIRECTLY APPLY FOR IT -- IN ADDITION TO COUNTY SEAT LIKE TO PARTICIPATE -- SO THERE WAS A LOT IN THERE BUT I'VE BEEN JUST A COUPLE THINGS THAT I WOULD RESPOND TO IS -- ONE IT WHAT HAS HELPED GET OUT INTO THE RURAL AREAS IS THIS HUB AND SPOKE MODEL THAT. I WAS REALLY STARTED TO FEDERAL FUNDS -- THAT IS HELPING GET BASICALLY SUPPORT CLINICS GOING INTO GOING OUT INTO A RULER AND THEN STE AND THEN ESSENTIALLY SPOKE IN OFF OF THE HUB SO -- FOR EXAMPLE AGES WHICH IS OF A PRIVATE COMPANY BUT IS IN THIS SPACE SAYS USE THOSE FUNDS. TO ESTABLISH -- CLINICS IN RED BLUFF YOU KNOW MY DISTRICT -- AND IS HOPING TO USE THAT CONTINUE THAT HUB AND SPOKE MODEL TO CONTINUE TO GET IT OUT. AND TO ALL THE AREAS -- BUT THAT MONEY IS IS DWINDLING AWAY IT'S NOT GONNA BE HERE LONG TERM WE DO NEED TO HAVE A CONTINUOUS SOURCE OF FUNDING AND SO I SEE THIS. AS A WAY TO DO THAT -- AND I AGREE LIKE THIS ISN'T THE ONLY SOLUTION BUT YOU KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THE THINGS THAT ARE BEING DONE. YOU KNOW LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF PILLS -- HAVING DRUG TAKE BACK PROGRAMS ALL THESE THINGS ARE GOOD. RIGHT BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE DAMAGE IS ALREADY DONE PEOPLE ARE ALREADY ADDICTED TO THIS STUFF OKAY SO THAT THAT KIND OF HELPS. YOU KNOW KINDA HEAD YOU KNOW HEADS THE IS A TOURNIQUET READ IT KIND OF KEEPS IT FROM SPREADING MORE. BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO ALREADY ADDICTED THE ONLY WAY TO REALLY DEAL WITH US TO GET THEM OFF OF YOU KNOW NOT ADDICTED ANYMORE RIGHT WHICH IS A MORE EXPENSIVE PROBLEM -- AND THAT'S WHERE THIS FUNDING AND TRYING TO GET MORE MORE THESE TREATMENT TREATMENTS AVAILABLE MAKE THEM MORE WIDESPREAD. HIS CELL PHONE TO THIS POINT THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT. YOU KNOW WE HAVE DEALT WITH DOCTORS AND PRESCRIBING WE HAVE DEALT WITH A LOT OF THESE OTHER AREAS. THE GROUP THAT HASN'T REALLY DONE MUCH ON THIS IS THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY THAT MANUFACTURES AND SO. TO ME AND SAYING HEY YOU KNOW THE PUBLIC'S DOING A LOT THE LOCALS ARE DOING A LOT -- PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS ARE DOING A LOT. HOW ABOUT YOU GUYS DO A LITTLE BIT ON THIS AS WELL RISING HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE A HUGE ISSUE AND IT'S PROBABLY BIGGER THAN JUST THIS DISCUSSION RIGHT HERE? BUT WHAT I SEE IS THAT THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY WERE LIMITING. AND YOU KNOW WE'RE LIMIT HOW MUCH YOU CAN REIMBURSE THAT MEDI CAL ALL THOSE THINGS RIGHT WE'RE WE'RE LIMóN A LOT OF THINGS WE'RE NOT REALLY LIMITING WHAT YOU CAN CHARGE FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. LAST I CHECKED -- SO. YOU KNOW IT IN THAT SPACE AND A AND AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT. NESTLE SHOULD GET INTO THAT RIGHT BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING IN THERE AND TELLING THEM WHAT THEY CAN CHARGE. THAT SET SEVENTEEN WAS PURELY A TRANSPARENCY BILL IF YOU'RE GOING TO RAISE THE PRICE. YEAH BUT MORE THAN 16% THEN HEY YOU SHOULD PROBABLY TELL EVERYBODY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT RIGHT -- SO THEY CAN PREPARE FOR THOSE INCREASING COSTS -- BUT THAT'S THE THE RISING HEALTHCARE COSTS THAT ISSUE IS. IS NOT JUST. NO THAT'S NOT GONNA BE IMPACTED BY THIS BILL RIGHT HERE. IT'S IMPACTED BY A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER FACTORS. THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH RIGHT -- AND SO. YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T TAG. THAT WHOLE PROBLEM ON ON THIS ONE BILL WHERE ARE YOU KNOW AS HE SAID A LOT OF EVERYBODY'S IN YEARS IN THE CAT THE COST IS GOING TO GET PASSED ON TO US OR TO US OR TO WHICH ONE IS IT. YOU KNOW I THINK THE REALITY IS INSURANCE IS ACTUALLY THE ONE WHO PICKS UP MOST OF THE COST OF THIS. AND IF IT WAS THAT HUGE OF A DRIVER TO THEM I WOULD THINK THEY WOULD BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST PEOPLE IN HERE IN OPPOSITION. THE FACT THEY'RE NOT I THINK IS A IS A PRETTY TELLING POINT. I THANK YOU [inaudible] FOR IDENTIFIED. AGAIN A MARKER BLAME THE ENTIRE RISING COST OF HEALTHCARE ON THE GALLAGHER BILL. BUT PARTY GO. THE THE GALLAGHER MCCARTY BOB JUST LIKE YOU SAYING THAT -- BUT BUT I DO THINK IT'S IT'S IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE TO CONTRIBUTOR TOWARDS RIGHT -- INCREASE HEALTHCARE COSTS EVEN IF IT'S IN A NOBLE. DEED OR A NOBLE ACTIVITY THAT WE'RE IT'S MORE MONEY IN THE POT. AND YOU DIDN'T ADDRESS IN YOUR ANSWER ALL DOCTORS TO GET YOUR OPINION BECAUSE YOU AND I HAVE A DISTRICTS THAT ARE BOTH RURAL IN NATURE -- WHAT ABOUT THE PROVIDER ISSUE ARE YOU SATISFIED THERE'S ADEQUATE? HELP IN THIS SPACE -- OUT -- ROE VERSUS YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT WHEN YOU SAY PROVIDER DO YOU MEAN I MEAN BECAUSE IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE A DOCTOR. ALL RIGHT NINE EIGHT AND BUT I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHERE THIS FUNDING IS GOING TO IS. THE THE GOAL THAT IS TO HIRE MORE PEOPLE IN THE DRUG TREATMENT SPACE THOSE COULD BE. DOC SAY COULD BE YOU KNOW. DRUG TREATMENT SPECIALISTS -- LIKE I SAID THERE'S ACTUALLY IN LISA MY DISTRICT IT'S MORE OF THIS THIS PRIVATE SPACES TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE MONEY IN. AN EXPANDING EN EN. AND MAKING A DIFFERENCE YOU KNOW -- BUT IN ORDER TO DO SO THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO CONTINUE TO HAVE FUNDING SO THEY CAN HIRE. THOSE PEOPLE AN OPEN THE AND OPEN THE CLINICS TO MAKE. MAKE THAT TREATMENT AVAILABLE -- SO I I I REALLY T&lt;c.cyan&gt; THE&lt;/c&gt; FUNDING TO THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE. TO HAVE MORE ACCESS. TO DRUG TREATMENT PROVIDERS -- AND YOU KNOW E CAN GET INTO THE THE WHOLE OTHER ISSUE OF LIKE HEY DO WE NEED. NO NOT MORE NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND KNOWS IT IS WHO CAN PRESCRIBE. CERTAIN MEDICATIONS THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT WE'VE TRIED TO DEAL WITH THAT I THINK WE DID PASSED LEGISLATION LAST YEAR -- THAT DEALT WITH THAT ISSUE -- BUT I DO CONNECT THE TWO AND THAT THIS WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO INSURING MORE ACCESS FOR APPRECIATE PRODUCTION PRECISELY MY POINT IS THAT THERE'S A NUMBER OF ISSUES MOVING FORWARD ON A PARALLEL TRACK HERE THAT -- THEY MAYBE NEED TO BE CONSIDERED -- IN CONCERT. AND THAT'S KIND OF MY POINT -- TOWARD YOUR BILL IS NOT THAT THIS COULD BE PIECES SOLUTION BUT WE CERTAINLY HAVE TO LOOK AT THE OTHER -- THE OTHER SPOKES ON A WHEEL THERE AND I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE DOING THAT AND UNFORTUNATELY IT'S ONLY IN THESE MOMENTS WHEN BILLS ARE UP FOR VOTES THAT WE GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY THAT PRESSURE -- TO ACCOMPLISH THAT RIGHT BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE HEAR OVER TO TAKE CARE THAT OTHER PROBLEM LATER. AND LATER NEVER COMES RIGHT AND THOSE OF US LIBERAL COMMUNITIES AND HOW MANY TIMES WE EXPANDED -- MEDI CAL AND IN ALL KINDS OF MAJOR INCREASES IN FUNDING AND WE DO NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PROVIDER SHORTAGE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES. AND WILL SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM WE GET THE NEXT BILLION AND THEN THE NEXT BILLION NEVER COMES SO -- AGAIN WHILE I SUPPORT WHAT YOU GUYS ARE ATTEMPTING TO ACCOMPLISH THIS IN IN THIS BILL AND I THINK THERE'S A MAJOR EPIDEMIC HERE AND I AND I COMMEND YOU FOR TAKING IT ON I DON'T THINK I'M PREPARED TO SUPPORT. YOUR BILL TODAY I'M GONNA GO AHEAD LAY OFF LEAVE OPEN THE POSSIBILITY THAT I CAN SUPPORT THIS TOMORROW -- BUT I WANT TO ENGAGE IN. SOME MORE THOROUGH DISCUSSIONS ON THESE TOPICS SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE SOLVING THE WHOLE PROBLEM -- AND NOT JUST SHIFTING. THE PROBLEM AROUND. ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] ASSEMBLYMEMBER RIVAS. FOR THAT THEY THE LOCKERS. FOR BRINGING THIS TO THE COMMITTEE. FOR THE CONVERSATIONS ARE. OF YOU I HAD ONE QUESTION YOU'D MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THERE WAS FEDERAL FUNDING THAT WILL END IN. TWENTY TWENTY WAS THIS FEDERAL FUNDING FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS. FOR THESE PEOPLE OR CORRECT. AT TWO FOLD -- ONE EVEN IF THE FEDERAL MONEY. DIDN'T RUN OUT WHICH RIGHT NOW THE FOLKS AT CONGRESS ARE SAYING WE HADN'T TOLD TWENTY TWENTY AND WHO KNOWS THAT. NEXT ELECTIONS AND PRESIDENT SO FORTH. OUR WITNESSES EARLIER OUR OUR TESTIFYING THAT THEY COULD DRAMATICALLY USE MORE MONEY ON TOP OF THE FEDERAL MONEY RIGHT NOW THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO AREN'T BEING SERVED IN THIS. HUB AND SPOKE MODEL WHO DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET. THIS COMMITTEE TREATMENT TO TO TO GET OFF. THIS DEADLY DISEASE -- BUT YES -- THE WE WE ARE ANTICIPATING THAT IT WOULD RUN OUT. AND IF THIS MEASURE BECAME LAW THE MONEY TO START COMING IN LITERALLY THE SAME YEAR THAT RUNS OUT BECAUSE THIS IS. IMPLEMENTED -- GET THE OUT YEAR PLUS ONE SO IT ACTUALLY OP TIES UP -- NICELY. OKAY WELL -- I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY. AND YOU KNOW I'D LIKE TO SEE THIS DISCUSSION CONTINUE YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES REYES TODAY -- BUT I THINK THAT. IF WE CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION I HOPE TO SEE. OF THOSE RESOLVED THAN US TO MOVE FORWARD IN A WAY THAT WILL HELP -- THE PEOPLE. THAT -- ADDICTED THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I SEEN AND I HAVE SOME -- I'M SORRY MR GRAY LEFT BECAUSE THEY DO. I DO THINK THAT THIS THAT AS AN ASSEMBLY AND SENATE WE HAVE WORKED ON THE FRONT AND LIKE YOU SAID ASSEMBLYMEMBER GALLAGHER I% THINK WE'VE LOOKED AT HOW DO WE SLOW THE BLEEDING ON THE SITUATION BUT WE HAVEN'T SPENT ACTUALLY AS MUCH TIME ON ADDICTION. AND THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY ADDICTED -- I AM A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED BY SOME OF THE TESTIMONY OF THE OPPOSITION I'M TO SAY BUSINESS AS USUAL IS OKAY IS CLEARLY NOT THE CASE AND A LOT OF OUR DISTRICTS WHERE WE HAVE MORE UPDATE PROJECT PRESCRIPTIONS THEN WE HAVE PEOPLE -- AND I THINK THERE'S A REAL CONCERN AND THERE'S A REAL NEED TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT I DON'T THINK THE INTENTION OF THE BUT THIS BILL IS TO HAVE PHARMACISTS TAKE ON THIS BURDEN EIGHT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT'S THE INTENTION AND I'M SURE. THE OTHERS WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS TO TO ASSURE THAT -- THREE OUT OF FOUR TEENAGERS BEGIN THEIR HER WAY INTO HEROIN ADDICTION WITH A PRESCRIPTION OPIOID. IN THEIR HOME AND UP UP CLEARLY THAT WAS PRESCRIBED TO THEM BY A DOCTOR. SO THIS IS A SERIOUS EPIDEMIC AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE SERIOUS WORK TO CREATE A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM AND I DO AGREE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY THAT THIS IS NOT THE TOTAL SOLUTION. HOWEVER WE NEED FUNDS WE NEED FUNDS FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES WE NEED FUNDS FOR CLINICS. AND ALTHOUGH NOT THE PERFECT SOLUTION I DO THINK THIS IS A STEP FORWARD AND CONVERSATION AND A SOLUTION FOR ADDICTION. NOT THE COMPLETE PROBLEM -- THERE ARE CROP COST DRIVERS -- BUT WE ALL DO PAY FOR OPIATE ADDICTION. WHETHER IT IS IN OUR HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS ARE IN STATE FUNDS I MEDI CAL WE ALL PAY FOR IT. SO TO ELIMINATE MANUFACTURERS FROM PAYING FOR IT I THINK IT'S UNREALISTIC AT THIS POINT. WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I I JUST -- APPRECIATE THAT THE DEBATE HERE IN THIS IS NOT ALWAYS AN EASY -- CONVERSATION HAVE ABOUT IT -- CHARGING A FEE I I DON'T THINK IT'S A TAX IT'S NOT A CERTAINLY NOT A JOB KILLER ANY PRODUCTS WHAT WE KNOW. SOMETHING ON THE OTHER NATIVE HAPPENS AND YOU OUTLINED IT THERE IS THAT -- YEAH THIS IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE FEDERAL CRISIS AND I CAN KERR BUT PEOPLE WHO ARE HOOKED ON FENNEL STARTED BECAUSE THEY EVERY ABUSING PAIN KILLERS. AND THE INDUSTRY HAS RESPONSIBILITY STEP UP AS PART OF THE SOLUTION. YEAH WOULD YOU SAID THIS IS IT I THINK AS YOU OUTLINE I MEAN THIS IS A VERY UNIQUE SITUATION -- AND IT IS A VERY UNIQUE CRISIS. YEAH I'M CERTAINLY NOT THE ONE THAT'S ALWAYS. STEPPING UP TO SAY HEY WE SHOULD HAVE MORE FEES OR OR A YOU KNOW. BUT IN THIS CASE WITH ALL THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW AND EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN GOING ON AND ALL THE THINGS WE'VE ALREADY DONE. I THINK IT IS WARRANTED -- AND IT JUST SAYS HEY YOU KNOW. MANUFACTURES BE PART OF THE SOLUTION BE PART OF THE SOLUTION TO GET PEOPLE OFF OF THIS. OF THESE DRUGS THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH WITH THE ADDICTION. AND ME TELL YOU RIGHT NOW ADDICTION IS IS AS I SAID LAST COMMITTEE ADDICTION IS THE BIGGEST JOB KILLER -- WHEN I'VE SEEN YOU KNOW PEOPLE GET ADDICTED TO THESE DRUGS AND NOT BE ABLE? TO LIVE PRODUCTIVE LIVES -- AND THAT HURTS YOUR ECONOMY THAT HURTS. YOUR LOCAL -- INDUSTRIES -- IT HURTS YOUR LAW ENFORCEMENT PUBLIC SAFETY. YOUR HOSPITALS ALL ACROSS THE BOARD SO. WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING I THINK THIS IS IS THIS BILL IS NEEDED AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THIS HIGHLY CALL THE ROLL. I WE NEED A MOTION AND A SECOND YEAH. MS HIGHLY CALDERON [inaudible] BURKE.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MEGAN SUPERS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH PLUS ADVOCATES THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE DOCTOR QUIRK. SO. HOW DO YOU HANDLE PROFESSIONAL GAMBLERS AND HOW DO YOU DEFINE IT SO THAT ANYBODY WHO HAS A LOSS TO US DOESN'T FIND THEM? JUST DECIDES THEIR PROFESSIONAL GAMBLER. WE'VE ENGAGES WITH DISCUSSIONS -- TRYING TO GET AFTER THE PROFESSIONAL ISSUE AS IT RELATES TO WORLD SERIES OF POKER AND SOME OF TOUCH VETS HAVE ARRIVED. YOU KNOW AT THAT CONCLUSION I THINK IT'S DIFFICULT TO YOUR POINT -- DEFINED IN SUCH A FASHION THAT YOU DON'T. YOUR OVERLY BROAD. HINTS AND AND BRING IN A BOOK OF THAT KIND OF LEISURE GAMBLING MONEY WHICH FRANKLY I THINK IS TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE AS A WRITE OFF ME TO COST -- THE STATE'S ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR -- IN REVENUE ON TOP OF THE FACT THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT JUST EXPANDED. THE RIGHT OFF SO SOME OF THAT PROFESSIONAL QUESTION MAY GET ANSWERED IN AS WE GET THE ANALYSIS FROM THE FROM THE FEDS ON HOW MUCH OF AN EXPANSION AND HOW THAT -- SAID CHANTING GLOBE WITH THAT WITH OUR BILL. GREAT I'M CERTAINLY WILLING TO SUPPORT IT TO YOU CAN GET IT DONE THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. ANY -- MYSTERIES. I WAS ACTUALLY GOING -- TO TO MOVE THIS THINKING BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF NOT HAVING ENOUGH DOCTORS IN. IN CALIFORNIA. BUT AS SOMEBODY WHO USED TO PREPARE TAXES -- I WAS SHOCKED AT THE NUMBER OF OF INDIVIDUALS -- WHO WOULD COME IN WITH TEN NINETY NINES IN FACT SOMETIMES ROLES OF TEN NINETY NINES? I'M YOU'D HAVE -- WE HAD A LOT OF NURSES THAT WOULD -- FIND THEMSELVES GAMBLING I'M QUITE A BIT OF THOSE WHO IS A NICHE OF BUSINESS THAT I HAD. AND IT ALMOST ALWAYS IF THEY HAD FIFTY SIXTY SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OF INCOME ALMOST ALWAYS THEY HAD FIFTY SIXTY SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OF LOSSES COURSE MAKE PERFECT SENSE -- THE FOR THAT TO BE THE CASE AND SO WOULD BE DIFFICULT WITHOUT THAT AND FOR ME IT WILL SUPPORT THAT. TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE REVENUE WOULD BE USED FOR WHICH THERE IS A DEFINITE NEED -- BUT JUST UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO DO GAMBLE AND THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN ESSENCE THEY'RE GONNA BE PAYING A TAX FOR FOR INCOME THAT THEY'VE NEVER. THEY'VE NEVER RECEIVED AND SO OFTEN THAT TO STAY OFF TODAY. IT DOES CONCERT I CERTAINLY WAY THAT QUESTION IN MY MIND -- ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION IT GAMBLING LIKE MANY OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT IS AN APPROPRIATE -- RIGHT OFF OF REGARDS SITUATION SO BUT I APPRECIATE WHERE YOU COME FROM THANK YOU.
