THE VERY PROFOUND ROAD THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE TRAVELED OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS- AND CERTAINLY THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE. BUT WHAT I'VE SEEN IS- A LOT OF VISIONARY LEADERSHIP- ON THE PART OF THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IT IS REALLY REWORKING AND RETHINKING AND REDIRECTING THE SYSTEM. SO THAT IT MORE FULLY MEETS THE NEEDS OF THAT ONE POINT TWO MILLION STUDENTS THAT WE SERVE AND IT IS PAN AND ENERGETIC. AND. A CHALLENGING ROLE BUT I- THE VISION- AND LITERALLY THE VISION FOR SUCCESS HAS BEEN. IS ONE THAT. BEST AND WILL BEST SERVE OUR STUDENTS FOR THE YEARS TO COME IT'S RECOGNIZED THAT THE CHANGES IN THE STATE THE CHANGES IN THE DEMOGRAPHICS AND THE CHANGES IN THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS. AND REALLY SORT OF REFRAME THE WHOLE- SO THAT STUDENTS ARE LOOKED AT IN A HOLISTIC MANNER MANNER SORRY AND IN A WAY- THAT WILL REALLY ENSURE THEIR EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS- IN THE NOT TO TAKE UP TOO MUCH TIME BUT THE- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S BEEN GREAT ABOUT THIS PROCESS IS. IT'S ALSO OCCASION FOR ME TO TAKE A LOOK BACK AND REALISE- WHAT EXTRAORDINARY CULMINATION OF PUBLIC SERVICE WORK THAT I'VE DONE IN THE PAST THIS IS- I WORKED AT A HEAD START I WORK CURRENTLY WITH YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE. AND BEING ABLE TO BE PART OF A SYSTEM THAT REALLY RECOGNIZE THE RESILIENCE RECOGNIZE THE RESILIENCE AND THE HOPE AND THE POTENTIAL IN EVERY SINGLE USE AN ADULT IN CALIFORNIA- IS. SOMETHING THAT I'M REALLY PROUD TO BE A PART OF IT IT SEEMS. FROM MY STANDPOINT TO BE ABLE TO DO THE WORK THAT I DO SORT OF WRIT LARGE- IN PARTICULAR AS- THERE ARE NOW ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND FOSTER YOUTH IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM UP FROM YEARS PAST AND I'VE SEEN FIRST. HOW IMPACTFUL THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE FOR THOSE USE AND HOW THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE THEIR GATEWAY TO A BETTER FUTURE AND HAVE PROVIDED SUPPORT SYSTEMS. AND AN OPEN DOOR POLICY- THAT IS REALLY GOING TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT. DIFFERENCE FOR THE ISSUES. AND I'VE SEEN IT FIRST HAND- OUR DAUGHTER WHO WE ADOPTED FROM FOSTER CARE- WAS A STUDENT AT SANTA MONICA COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND USED TO TRANSFER TO UC DAVIS SO- I SEE IT EVERY DAY IN THE WORK THAT I DO IN FIRSTHAND SO AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND- I AM HONORED TO BE ABLE TO SERVE- THE STUDENTS AND THE ADULTS OF THE STATE AND THE IN THE STATE IN SUCH A MANNER.

I HEAR MEMBERS OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON RULES- MY NAME IS DR BOBBY A LITTLE. HERE'S A PRIVILEGE TO BE HERE TODAY ARE LIKELY TELL YOU JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- AFTER SERVING IN THE MARINE CORPS FOR YEARS. I HAD A VERY IMPORTANT DECISION TO MAKE AND THAT WAS EITHER REINVEST. OR LEAVE THE MILITARY GO BACK TO SCHOOL- HOWEVER AFTER FOUR YEARS IN THE SERVICE OF NOT SURE COLLEGE IN THE RIGHT PLACE FOR ME. AND THAT IS WHEN A FRIEND MENTIONED ON THE CITY COLLEGE AND APPARATUS WORK WITH THAT I REALIZED LBCC WILL GET A PERFECT PLACE FOR ME TO BEGIN MY ACADEMIC CAREER- I HAVE SINCE I WAS A CAREER WORKING WITH VETERANS AND MILITARY FAMILIES. AND EVERY PRODUCT OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM I CAN HONESTLY SAY. I WOULD NOT BE WHERE I AM TODAY WITHOUT THE SUPPORT AND EDUCATION I RECEIVED. AS A STUDENT BACKGROUND. MOSTLY CITY COLLEGE- SERVING ON THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS IS AN HONOR AND PRIVILEGE AND I THINK YOU'RE VERY SERIOUSLY. AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE MY BEST REPRESENTING OUR STUDENT VETERANS AND MILITARY FAMILIES BROTHERS TWO. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO MEET WITH THIS AFTERNOON AFTER THE AFTER THE HEARING FLETCHER INSPECTIONS YEAH THANK YOU.

I AM THANK YOU- CHAIR. IN AND LET ME JUST SAY I KNOW THESE TO THIS HEARING WAS POSTPONED AND- I MET WITH YOU NUMBER FOUR WEEKS AGO. AND IT WAS RELLY HELPFUL MEETING WITH BOTH OF YOU AND I'M REALLY COMFORTABLE BUT I THOUGHT I'D PUT ONE QUESTION JUST SORT OF TO EACH OF YOU OUT OF THE MEETING AND- AND TO JENNIFER PERRY. OF THIS IS A REAPPOINTMENT FOR YOU AND YOUR FORTY SERVE SIX YEARS ON THE BOARD AND WE TALKED ABOUT. WHAT YOU'VE LEARNED OVER SIX YEARS AND HOW IT'S GOING TO HONE IN ON YOUR FOCUS FOR THE NEXT TERM AND I THOUGHT I'D GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO. TO SPEAK TO THAT AND PUBLIC HOW WOULD YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE LEARNED DURING YOUR SERVICE AND HOW IT'S GOING TO FOCUS YOU GOING FULL. THANK YOU SENATOR AND IT WAS IT WAS A PLEASURE TO MEET WITH YOU AS A- COUPLE WEEKS AGO WHATEVER IT WHENEVER IT WAS- AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I MEAN. THE TRUTH IS YOU KNOW THE EARLY PART OF THE SIX YEARS WAS A HUGE LEARNING CURVE. AND WE THINK THE GLASS AND I HAVE DISCUSSED THIS I MEAN THE SYSTEM AS YOU KNOW. COMPLEX AND INTRICATE AND MULTI FACETED SO- PART OF. REALLY SOME OF THE GREAT PRO THAT TAKE AWAY FROM THAT FOR SIX YEARS. I UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM. SO MUCH BETTER- AND- THAT WILL. SERVE ME WELL IN TERMS OF- LOOKING FORWARD- TO WHAT I WANT TO FOCUS ON AS- AS I THINK I'VE MENTIONED. TO YOU BEFORE I. ONE PROUD OF AND LUCKY ENOUGH TO SERVE. ON THE BOARD AT THE TIME WHEN WE ARE CREATING THE VISION FOR SUCCESS. AND IMPLEMENTING- SORT OF OUR D. III STRUCTURE AND PRIORITIES FOR THE YEARS TO COME. SO THOSE ARE. ON THEIR WAY BUT THERE'S STILL A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK TO BE DONE THERE ALREADY WAS OBVIOUSLY THE PANDEMIC. HAS SLOWED DOWN THE PROGRESS- OF SOME OF THE BIG INITIATIVES THAT WE'VE BUT WE'VE UNDERTAKEN. BUT I THINK YOU KNOW SR VICE CHANCELLOR AS YOU GONZALEZ SAID TO US IN A RECENT MEMO WE STILL NEED TO KEEP LASER FOCUSED ON. OUR STUDENTS FROM IN SPITE OF ALL THAT I THINK. SO FAR- WE ARE DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF THAT- GIVEN GIVEN EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON- FROM A PERSONAL STANDPOINT- I WOULD I MY FOCUS REALLY WILL CONTINUE TO BE. THOSE FORTY SOME ODD THOUSAND YEARS IN FOSTER. CARE THAT. OUR ATTENDING OR CAN YOU OLLEGE. THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD WORK THAT CAN BE DONE- HAS BEEN DONE. HEY WE NEED A- OUR PROGRAMS LIKE NEXT UP- TO. DROP THE AGE FOR ELIGIBILITY TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM TO MORE CAMPUSES. WE NEED TO EXPAND OUR INCREASE OUR COMMUNICATIONS WITH THOSE FOSTER USE BECAUSE- WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO WELCOME THEM TO. MAKE SURE IT'S OKAY TO BE KNOWN AS OUR OUR- VERY LUCKY- IN OUR VICE CHANCELLOR TO HAVE- A FORMER FOSTER YOUTH AND WE HAVE. COMING ON TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS A YOUNG MAN WHO'S SUPPOSED TO BE. WHO BY ALL ACCOUNTS IS VERY DYNAMIC AND- HE'S MENTIONED AND I THINK HE'S RIGHT NOW PART OF OUR ROLE IS TO- IS TO. ACTUALLY INCREASE COMMUNICATION PROFESSION YOU SO THAT THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE ACCESSING THE STUDENTS THAT WE ARE WE ARE. JUST STARTING WITH THE- THE SERVICES THAT WE HAVE BEEN THERE FOR THEM- SO. I THINK THAT LOOKING FOR WILL BE A BIG PART OF MY ROLE AND ALSO. AS I MENTIONED TO YOU- ENSURING THAT CALIBRATE- WHICH HAS REGAINED ITS FOOTING- TO A GREAT DEGREE. CONTINUES ON THAT COURSE NOT BECAUSE I THINK IT HAS A LOT TO. OFFER THAT THE STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. I THANK YOU FOR THAT TO A RESPONSE I APPRECIATED AND- AND YOU DID MENTION A NUMBER OF THINGS INCLUDING CAL BRIGHT THAT WE TALKED ABOUT A DURING THE SESSION. AND I KNOW WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE FUNDING FORMULA AND THE FACT THAT THAT'S GOING TO NEED TO BE. DEALT WITH GIVEN SOME OF THE COLLEGES THAT ARE IN HOLD HARMLESS STAGE IN THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WORK ON THAT GOING FORWARD NOT APPRECIATED BOTH OF YOUR COMMENTS ON THAT. AND FOR DOCTOR OF VIA LOBOS. JUST AS AS MISS PERRY TALKED ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE. WITH FOSTER CARE BEING A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT SHE BRINGS TO. THE BOARD WHEN WE TALKED. YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AS A VETERAN AND VETERANS PROGRAMS. I SEEM LIKE IT WAS- SOMETHING THAT. ARE YOU BROUGHT TO THE BOARD IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF VETERANS THAT ARE IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. AND I DID ENJOY OUR BRIEF MOMENT WHERE YOU TALKED ABOUT PEOPLE WITH NO GRADES BEING CHALLENGED IN GETTING VA BENEFITS. YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND YOU WERE TALKING TO THE ONE MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE. THAT HAS A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE DEGREE WITHOUT GETTING A SINGLE LETTER GRADE. IT AND YOU WALKED RIGHT INTO THAT AND YOU WERE VERY. YOU HAD UPON WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT SO- WHAT'S YOUR- TALK ABOUT YORK'S. AS A VETERAN AND WITH VETERANS PROGRAMS AND WHAT THAT PROMPTS YOU TO DO AS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE- GOVERNOR. YES SIR R. WILL FIRST AND FOREMOST- I CAN TELL YOU THAT- OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE DOING INCREDIBLE JOB WORKING WITH OUR VETERANS AND MILITARY FAMILIES. WHEN I FIRST STARTED AT LONG BEACH CITY COLLEGE IN SPRING TWO THOUSAND FOUR- BETTER RESOURCE CENTERS FOR NOT A- WE'RE NOT A BANK PERCENT. WE HAD NO BUDGET RESOURCE CENTERS ON CAMPUS AT THE TIME- THOSE DID NOT COME UNTIL WAY AFTER- BUT I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH AND BLESSED TO BE ABLE TO SEE THEM GET BALLS AND- TRYING TO WHAT THEY ARE TODAY. WHICH IF THE SPACE FOR VETERANS AND MILITARY FAMILIES REALLY GET TOGETHER AND- TALK TO SOMEONE ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF FIVE FOR THE BENEFITS AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE VETERANS AND MILITARY. FAMILY MEMBERS ARE IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE- AS A VETERAN COMMUNITY COLLEGE THAT THE MARKETS THAT MIGHT BENEFIT- ALLOWED ME TO USE. BACK TO SCHOOL- THIS THAT I RECEIVE AT THE- COLLEGE- REALLY. INFLUENCED MY CAREER PATH- BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO NEEDS- HUNDREDS. OF VETERANS AND MANY OF THEM WERE ACTUALLY STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND HOUSING YOU CHOOSE. AND THAT IS WHAT SPARKED MY INTEREST IN THE BACK FROM SPACE TO WORK WITH VETERANS AND- MILITARY FAMILIES IN THE FIRST PLACE- THAT IS YOU KNOW I COULD WALK INTO A CAREER WORKING WITH SECONDS AND ALL HER FAMILY- BUT IT ALSO HAS- OPENED MY EYES TO SOME OF THE- IT WILL CHALLENGES OUR VETERANS ARE FACING- IN THE SYSTEM. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VETERANS AND MILITARY FAMILIES WITH STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES HOUSING ISSUES- EMPLOYMENT ISSUE. AND MICHAEL- FOR THE NEXT THAT WE WANTED TO. CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON WORKING FLAT- NEEDED ORGANIZATIONS AND THE BATHROOMS ARE CENTERS OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO. MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR ACTION OUR FAMILY. AS THEY ARE NEEDED- MICHAEL HAS ALWAYS CHANGE YOU. ARE ENGAGED WITH A BACK AND POPULATION. AND TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES. THE FOURTEENTH- NEEDS BECOME A CRISIS ARE FORTUNATELY WHAT I'VE SEEN. THROUGHOUT MY CAREER SEVERAL TIMES IN FACT WE- START TO ENGAGE A POPULATION. IN THE STATE BACKED UP FOR EXAMPLE ONCE THEY ARE PRICES AND MICHAEL DOLLARS THANK YOU FOR ACTIVE AND IDENTIFY THOSE NEEDS- I HAD A TIME IN REALLY BE MORE PROACTIVE AND- ADDRESS THOSE MOVE BEFORE THEY GET TO A POINT WHERE- NOW THEY CRISIS MODE- THAT'S WHY I'M VERY THANKFUL. TO HAVE BEEN REAPPOINTED TO THE BOARD- I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE MET- BAKER RESOURCE CENTERS AND- VETERANS AND MILITARY FAMILIES WATER SYSTEM AND- THE FIFTEENTH RIGHT THAT APPOINTMENT CHALLENGES YOU'RE FACING. AND ADDRESS. THANK YOU APPRECIATE APPRECIATE BOTH YOUR COMMENTS LOOK FORWARD SUPPORT YOU BOTH. THANK YOU SENATOR- LET ME ASK MA'AM SURE YOU READ OR DO YOU ME TO GIVE YOU A MORE TO. I AM A GOOD BECAUSE. I AM I AM ON NOT YET YOU ARE. I'M I'M A LITTLE DISCOUNT GUYS PAULA EYES I JUST FROM SO I HAVE TO GO BACK SO I KNEW IN. COLUMN BUT I WANTED TO SHARE MINE WITH YOU INITIALLY I THINK THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST THINGS CALIFORNIA'S DONE AN EXPANDING IT IS THE PROVIDED ME AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY. HI TO NOT TO LOSE A YEAR OF COLLEGE MAKING MY PARENTS VERY HAPPY WHEN I WAS ABLE TO GO COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND PICK UP A SEMESTER BECAUSE I'D BE AND- OUT OF THE COUNTRY ARE. DOING AS A FOREIGN NOT EXCHANGE STUDENT SO THAT WAS GREAT AND THEN WHEN I RETURNED I WAS ABLE TO PICK UP SOME ADDITIONAL- ADDITIONAL UNITS ALSO TO MOVE FORWARD IN IN MY CAREER AS A SOCIAL WORKER SO. IT'S JUST GREAT AND NOW LOOKING AT YOUR RESUMES AND HEARING. ACTUALLY YOUR RESUME AS AN ANODE KNOWING THE TIME THAT YOU MISS PERRY. AND YOU DOCTOR VIA LOBOS HI I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IS OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING THAT. I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF AND SUPPORTIVE OF YOU THE QUESTIONS I WAS GOING TO. ASK WERE ABOUT THE FOSTER YOUTH AND ALSO ABOUT THE VETERANS. RESOURCE CENTER IN WHAT'S GOING ON THERE I KNOW ON MY COMMUNITY COLLEGE SAID ABOUT COMMUNITY COLLEGE. IN SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY HAS BEEN VERY INVOLVED. I SEE YOU NODDING YOUR HEAD SO I. DIDN'T BE AN AGRI AND ALSO ON THE WORK FORCE ON INVESTMENT THE WORK FORCE OF COLLEGE. OR THE WORKFORCE. SKEWS THE WORK FORCE OF. AGENDA THAT THEY HAVE THAT THE CLASSES EXCUSE ME TO HELP WITHOUT CERTAINLY VERY IMPORTANT FOR BOTH OF OUR FOSTER YOUTH AND OUR VETERANS SO THAT WOULD I COULD LET YOU OFF THE HOOK AND NOT ASK ANY QUESTIONS BECAUSE THEY WERE ASKED SPECIFICALLY THAT I WAS VERY INTERESTED IN THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES BE AND REALLY I THINK VERY FUNDAMENTAL IN TAKING OUT ON. AS WE'VE SEEN PEOPLE TRANSITION- ITO NEW CAREERS AND ESPECIALLY AFTER THE PANDEMIC OF THE OPPORTUNITY FOR RETRAINING AND HERE RE ENTERING AND FOR VETERANS FOR LAND FOR FOSTER KIDS SO LET ME START WITH YOU MISS PERRY AND THEN DOCTOR VIA LOBOS JUST GIVE ME YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHETHER WE WERE MEETING TARGETS ON THAT WHOLE- COMPONENT OF WHAT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE TAKEN ON HOW TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRANSITION INTO. NEW CAREERS IF THE ONE YOU HAD LOST DIDN'T WORK OUT OR OR WE'VE LOST- BASICALLY- AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EMPLOYMENT AND THEN AND NOW NOW WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT BECAUSE AND THERE'S AN ISSUE REGARDING ACCOUNTABILITY AND WHETHER WE'RE MEETING THAT THE TARGETS I GUESS BETTER SAID THE GOALS THAT CERTAINLY UP. THAT YOU ALL WOULD HAVE BEEN HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE ON THE COLLEGES HOUSEHOLDS ACROSS THE STATE THAT ARE FOCUSING AND MEETING SOME OF THE GOALS. THAT YOU WOULD HOLD WOULD BE ATTAINED- THANK YOU CENTER THANK YOU FOR THE- I MEAN FROM A- THE- WE'VE MADE GREAT STRIDES- THAT. THERE HAS BEEN. AND TREMENDOUS INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SERVICES AVAILABLE PLUS YOU CAN EVEN RENAME SOME OF THE PROGRAMS AND COUNTIES TO. DO NEXT UP AND THERE'S BEEN AN ONGOING RECOGNITION THAT THOSE STUDENTS NEED BOTH- THE ACADEMIC OPPORTUNITY BUT TO BE BOLSTERED BY- SUPPORTS THAT RECOGNIZED- THE PARTICULAR HARDSHIPS THEY FACED IN THEIR YOUNG LIVES SO. I THINK WE PLAYED A GREAT FOUNDATION AS I MENTIONED NEXT UP IS A FORTY FIVE COLLEGES YOU KNOW WE HOPE IT'LL BE A NINETY COLLEGES- IT. AND IT CAN SERVE MORE AND MORE USE THAN I THINK- SINCE WE HAVE A POPULATION AS SIGNIFICANT POPULATION OF PROPERTIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- CERTAINLY WE NEED MORE SERVICES TO SERVICE USE BUT WE HAVE. LAID THE FOUNDATION AND WORKING DOWN AND MOVING FORWARD- I SEE GREAT PROMISE FARE- YOUR QUESTION ABOUT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT- I DO AGAIN THINK THAT WERE ON A REALLY STRONG TRACK. MOVING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THOSE I THINK IT'S ABOUT A MILLION SORT OF MID MIDDLE INCOME- HIGHER HIGHER INCOME JOBS THAT WILL BE- NEEDED TO BE FILLED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE NEXT FIVE OR SO YEARS. AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING FROM WORK FORCE DEVELOPMENT STANDPOINT- AND FOCUSING A LOT ON- HEALTHCARE AND HOSPITALITY ISSUES BUT CREATING THE CONSORTIUM COLLEGES AND EMPLOYERS AND SEVEN DISTRICTS LOOKING TO CREATE AN ACTUAL QUITE WANT TRY BLIND IT WILL TRAIN THE STUDENTS. IN A TRADE THAT MATCHES THE EMPLOYERS NEED AND YOU'RE SEEING A LOT OF SUCCESS IN THAT AREA YOU'RE SEEING STUDENTS- IT'S ON THE COLLEGES THAT ARE- BEING ENTERED INTO JOBS THAT ARE PAYING. 9% AND MORE OF WHAT THEY PREVIOUSLY EARNED- AND YOU'RE SEEING THEM. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT HELP THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. MY FEELING THAT. NIELSEN NEED TO BE FILLED CORPORATE TYPE OF JOBS- I THINK WE'VE GOT. FIVE THOUSAND COMPLETIONS THAT AREA AGAIN AGAIN REALLY GOOD START THERE SO MUCH MORE WE CAN DO BUT I DO SEE A LOT OF PROMISE. IN THE WORK FORCE DEVELOPMENT AREA. THANK YOU. INDUCTOR WILL BMO BOTH YOUR THOUGHTS FOR VETERANS ON THAT. WHAT WE AND- FIRST AND FOREMOST FACT THAT I DON'T LOVE UNITY COLLEGES THAT THE STATE- I CAN TELL YOU- SETTLE BACK IS IT GOING ON AMAZING JOBS- ALONG WITH OUR- OTHERS BUT FELL BACK IT'S NOT AN AMAZING JOB CERTAIN THE BECKHAM POPULATION- I WANT TO BE PACKED A LOT OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

RESOURCE CENTER ARE YOU MADE JOB WITH A POPULATION OF MAIL CARE- IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR ME A CALL- THE RESEARCH CENTERS YOU. HAVE PARTNERSHIP WHERE IT LOOKED WORKING. AND ALLOW THEM TO PROVIDE A DISH RESOURCE FOR ABOUT AND SO TALKING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH HOUSING EMPLOYMENT RESOURCE- WE HAVE BACKED SCREENING OUR- GRADUATE WITH A TRADE AND THEY ARE A- TO KEEP CONNECT WITH LOCAL. WE'RE GONNA THAT COMPLY THEM. INTO A JOB FOR TO PARTNER. IF I WOULD BE- WERE ALSO TO- YOURS THAT ARE. I DIDN'T FIND IT ME. RIGHT THERE ARE. THAT PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR. AND THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR CONNECTED WITH ALL THESE ORGANIZATIONS YOU. ARE IN A PROACTIVE WAY ENGAGE THE VETERAN POPULATION I THINK YOU NEED A SERVICE THAT THAT. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I'M VERY PROUD OF OUR COLLEGES- BECAUSE IT TAKES A LOT OF EXTRA WORK- THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS THE PHONE JOB DESCRIPTION DOESN'T REALLY LITERALLY SOMEONE TAKE IN ADDITIONAL TIME OUT OF HIS SCHEDULE. TO ENGAGE WITH LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS AND IDENTIFY THE RESOURCES ARE VETERANS NEED AND MAKE SURE THAT OUR PENSIONS GET THOSE SOURCES. HAVING ORGANIZATION AFTER THE CAMPUS OFFENSE AND FIND EVERY EVERY WEEK LIKE THEY DO I SETTLE BACK FOR EXAMPLE. AND BE AVAILABLE FOR VETERANS AND MILITARY FAMILIES THOSE RESOURCES.

AND APPLYING FOR GRANTS AND THE NEWS ARTICLES GOES ON THAT AFTER THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT WAS BROUGHT UP BY A PROFESSOR. TO THE ORGANIZATION AND THEY CHECKED- DID THE BACKGROUND OR DID SOME INVESTIGATING THEY FOUND OUT THAT THEY WERE HUNDRED SIXTEEN COLLEGE SYSTEMS THAT SAY THERE HAD A SPIKE IN CYBER ATTACKS. THE BOATS WERE FEELING AT CLASSES AND TAKEN SLOTS FROM REAL STUDENTS IT TERM SEEM TO BE WELL ORCHESTRATED AND A AND A LITTLE COOLEY LED THE ASSAULT OF WEAKNESS IN THE SYSTEM. IT'S A SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND APPLICATIONS WERE TAKEN FROM ONE.

IF YOU WANT I CAN START AND NOT PLASTIC YOU WANT TO FILL IN- THANK YOU FOR- THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO BE WITH US EARLIER AND FOR BRINGING UP THIS ISSUE BECAUSE YES WE ARE WELL AWARE- OUR OUR VICE CHANCELLOR. AT ACTING- CHANCELLOR SKEWS ME GONZALEZ- BROUGHT THIS TO OUR ATTENTION IMMEDIATELY- AND STARTED OUTLINED THE STEPS THAT SHE'S TAKING ACROSS THE SYSTEM- TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE- WHICH OBVIOUSLY NONE OF US WANT TO HAVE. HAPPEN AND- WE NEED TO ADDRESS IT NOW AND STRONGLY AND FIRMLY- SHE'S ALREADY WORKING WITH- THE INSPECTOR GENERAL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION- THEY ARE. LOOKING AT NEW DATA REPORTING- FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE ON UP LOOKING AT MODERNIZING OUR- CCC APPLY SYSTEM TAKING IMMEDIATE AND STRONG STEPS TO ADDRESS AND ROOT OUT THIS FRAUD BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT NO ONE WANTS THEIR TAX DOLLARS. GOING TOWARD ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE STUDENTS FOR- FOR WHOM THERE ARE A LOT IT SO THAT THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS HAVE BEEN MADE VERY AWARE OF THIS AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT WE WILL HAVE A- LENGTHY AND IN DEPTH PRESENTATION AT OUR- UPCOMING MEETING- SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO. TO LOOK AT THIS AS A LOOK AT THIS PROBLEM AND MAKE SURE IT IS AT. ADEQUATELY. ADDRESSED THANK YOU. MR VIA LOBOS YOU HAVE A TO ADD. YES AND- FOR MOST BETTER GROWTH THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE WHILE- AS- MEMBER MENTIONED- IT'S- AN ITEM OF THE UP IMPORTANCE- HAVING WORKED IN THE NONPROFIT SECTOR FOR SO MANY YEARS I CAN TELL YOU THAT. NO ONE WANTS TO SEE AN ALERT ANY OF OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE GOING AWAY- ESPECIALLY IN A BROADWAY- I AM- RIGHT THERE WITH- MEMBER CARRYING ON HER KIND OF COMING- I KNOW THAT YEAH CHAPLET BOPPARD- MONITORING THE SITUATION AND- YOU HAVE WHILE- AND WE HOPE TO GET TO.

WELL THE YOU VERY MANAGE AM I IT'S COME. IN YOUR EYES CAN BOTH- YOU AND MY PERRY. IT'S NOT COMPLETE IN YOUR- BUT WOULD YOU- SUPPORT AN AUDIT IN THIS- TO DO A COMPLETE INVESTIGATION SO THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY FIND OUT IF THERE IS. A FRAUD TAKING PLACE AND- I MEAN WE OBVIOUSLY KNOW THERE'S FRAUD TAKING PLACE BUT THAT WE'VE BEEN COVERED IN. LOSS OF DOLLARS AND HOW WE CONDEMN THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR COULD POSSIBLY MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO PREVENT THIS FRAUD FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE. I THINK CENTER THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THIS IS SO NEW- IT WOULD BE OUT OF MY PURVIEW TO COMMENT ON WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE IN ON IT I THINK YOU KNOW GIVE US A MONTH OR SO TO REALLY FULLY. OR A COUPLE OF MONTHS TO REALLY LOOK AT THIS AND DIGEST AND REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING SO. I THINK IT WOULD BE PREMATURE FOR ME- IN TERMS OF WHERE WE ARE IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING THE CHALLENGE AND ALSO- TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION IN THE AFFIRMATIVE OR THE NEGATIVE AT THIS JUNCTURE- AND ALSO LET ME TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY. TO- TELL NUMBER AVAILABLE VIA LOBOS AND I WERE FOR DOING THAT WE- HEAR FROM THE REMAINDER OF THE MEETING APOLOGIES. WE'VE CONNECTED A LOT THROUGH THIS PROCESS SO APOLOGIES FOR THE INFORMALITY. I DON'T THINK HE WOULD BUT HE MINDS I THINK IT'S AND- MORE PERSONAL WE DO HAVE A AT A PROTOCOL HERE TO. YOU KNOW. MEMBER PERRY MEMBER AND- AS- AS- THE LOBOS AND- I MEAN THERE'S PEOPLE I MEAN THE OTHER DAY I WAS CONSUMMATE GALA G. INTERNS GALGIANI THAT I'VE ALWAYS COME TO THE L. G. YOU KNOW SO IT'S- IT'S JUST DIFFERENTLY AND IT SHOWS CLOSENESS AND PERSONAL PERSONALITY SO I WOULDN'T I DON'T THINK I'D WORRY ABOUT IT I'M NOT SPEAKING FOR YOU. MR VILLALOBOS. YEAH HE DID. THE MOST CERTAINLY AT- AS YOU WITH THAT- WE NEED WITHOUT. HOT SO THIS LAST MONTHS I'VE PREPARE FOR THAT WHILE SO HAVE TO FOUND RIGHT BELOW- DESPITE THAT AND THAT THIS. AND NOT A LITTLE PERSON BY. OUR AGREE WITH HER ON HER- REGARDING- IT BEING PERFECT PRICE. I GIVE YOU RESPONSE RIGHT NOW- YEAH YOU KNOW. TO FROM NOW WILL BE ABLE TO ANSWER SITUATION AND WE'RE COME BACK. TO YOU WITH A WORK. ANSWER AND IT'S TOPIC. I RESPECT THAT RISK AND I YOU VERY MUCH FOR- MAKE. I SPENDING TIME BOTH OF YOU THE OTHER DAY. ESPECIALLY WITH YOUR- ON- I BRING THIS ISSUE THAT I BROUGHT IT PUBLICLY TODAY BECAUSE I WASN'T AWARE ABOUT IT AND WE'RE OF IT UNTIL THIS AFTERNOON OR YESTERDAY ACTUALLY. SO THANK YOU AND I LOOK FORWARD. TO YOUR GUISES CONFIRMATION. OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR WATER THANK YOU MADAM TEM O. AS SOMEONE WHO ONCE ON A- BOARD OF TRUSTEES FOR OUR OTHER COMMUNITY. DISTRICT I HAVE MUCH RESPECT YOU BOTH- I BELIEVE YOU BOTH TO BE ABLE TO QUALIFY FOR THESE APPOINTMENTS AND I HAVE NO QUESTIONS SINCE MANY OF THE QUESTIONS I WOULD HAVE ASKED. HAVE ALREADY BEEN POSED TO YOU SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR- AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE- THEN AS NOW. I'M I THINK- AS I ONLY HAVE ONE QUESTION I. LIKE MY COLLEAGUES REALLY RESPECT THE SYSTEM FEEL LIKE WE HAVE SOME EXCELLENT EXAMPLES OF MY OWN COMMUNITY IN SAN DIEGO. OF FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. IT IS A VERY LARGE SYSTEM WITH OVER TWO MILLION STUDENTS I BELIEVE AND- IN TERMS OF THE REPRESENTATION WE HAVE OBVIOUSLY- URBAN AREAS LIKE THE LOS ANGELES AREA THE BAY AREA YOU KNOW SAN DIEGO WHILE WE HAVE EIGHT OR NINE- IT'S STILL SMALLER THAN THAT AND I THINK THE BAY AREA AS A WHOLE AND LOS ANGELES. BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE STATE- AND OTHER COUNTY SO I GUESS I WOULD ASK YOU TO INDULGE ME AND HELP ME. UNDERSTAND YOUR PERSPECTIVE AS YOU APPROACH THE WHOLE SYSTEM. AND WHAT THE NEEDS OF SOME OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE AND MAYBE SOME OF OUR MORE RURAL COMMUNITIES AND COUNTIES VERSUS SAY ARE LARGER URBAN AREAS. AND AS A IT ARE THE CERTAINLY A GOVERNOR ON THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS. YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU LOOK AT THAT JUST AT IT'S NOT A DIRECT SPECIFIC QUESTION BUT IT'S MORE WHAT'S YOUR PHILOSOPHY ON. REPRESENTATION FOR AREAS BROADER THAN AREAS YOU MIGHT REPRESENT FOR THE WHOLE SYSTEM SO MISS PERRY I'LL START WITH YOU AND THEN- I GO TO DOCTOR VIA LOBOS- THANK YOU CENTER AND I ACTUALLY THINK ONE OF THE- STRENGTHS OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM IS EXACTLY THAT. IT'S EXTRAORDINARY BREADTH AND DIVERSITY NO ONE COLLEGE IS EXACTLY LIKE THE OTHER YOU KNOW WITHIN LA YOU HAVE A COLLEGE THAT HAS A GREAT AERONAUTICS PROGRAM- YEAH AND YOU KNOW. IT IN THE VALUE OF ONE THAT HAS A PROGRAM IT'S WORKING WITH TESTS ON CARS IN THE MORE RURAL AREAS THAT EACH. WHAT'S BEEN REALLY WONDERFUL ABOUT THE WAY THE SYSTEM WORKS AND SOMETIMES CHALLENGING BECAUSE YOU HAVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN- PHYSICAL ENTITIES THAT ARE SERVING VERY DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES IN VERY DIFFERENT NEEDS BUT- THE WAY THE SYSTEM IS STRUCTURED. IT DOES TO A LARGE DEGREE IN ABLE EACH COLLEGE TO DEVELOP. THE PLANS AND SERVICES THAT.
