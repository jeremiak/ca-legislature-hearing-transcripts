HELLO AGAIN HONORABLE CHAIR PORTANTINO AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M JOHANNA FINNEY OF THE NEVADA COUNTY TELECOM PUBLIC WORKING GROUP. THANK YOU FOR TIME TO SPEAK TODAY MANY OF THIS YEAR'S STATE BROADBAND BILLS INCLUDING AB FOURTEEN UNNECESSARILY SUBSIDIZE SUBSIDIZED THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY EXPANSION. WE ALONG WITH MANY OTHERS SUPPORT THE INTENTIONS OF THIS BILL LISTED IN SECTION ONE THE BILL INTENDS TO CREATE A FIBER OPTIC NETWORK FOR MIDDLE MILE BROADBAND SERVICE DEPLOYMENT. AMBAC CALL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR UNSERVED HOUSEHOLDS TO CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE WITH RELIABLE INTERNET CONNECTIVITY. THE PROBLEMS ARE IN THE DETAILS THE ALLEGED TECHNOLOGY NEUTRALITY BETWEEN WIRED AND WIRELESS SERVICE. THERE IS NO REAL EQUIVALENCE BETWEEN THE TWO WIRELESS OF ANY G. IS CHEAP THIRD RATE BROADBAND SERVICE FAR INFERIOR TO FIBER OPTIC OR CABLE SERVICE DIRECTLY TO HOMES. WIRELESS INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT RELIABLY FAST ENOUGH AS AN AND NOT SYMMETRIC THE DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY AND THERE JUNE TWENTY ONE OF FUNDING RECOMMENDS REQUIREMENTS FOR BROADBAND CORONAVIRUS RECOVERY FUNDS. STATES THAT WHAT IS NEEDED FOR FEDERAL BROADBAND FUNDING IS ONE HUNDRED MEGABITS DOWN ON WHAT WE RECEIVED AND ONE HUNDRED UPLOAD WHAT WE STAND THIS IDEA WAS ALSO SUPPORTED ON JULY EIGHTH. BY THE GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE WIRELESS BROADBAND FROM WIRELESS INFRASTRUCTURE CAN'T MEET THE STANDARD PERIOD ACCORDING TO CLASS SPEECH CHECK IN PC MAGAZINE. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE FIVE G. IS NO FASTER THAN FOUR G. AND IT'S A SYMMETRIC UPLOAD SPEEDS ARE A SMALL FRACTION OF ITS DOWNLOAD SPEEDS WIRELESS USE USES MICROWAVE RADIATION THROUGH THE AIR. A PROVEN CARCINOGEN NEUROTOXIN AND IMMUNO SUPPRESSOR TO SEND AND RECEIVE DATA BY CONTRAST FIBER OPTICS USES VISIBLE LIGHT THROUGH A CABLE TO SEND AND RECEIVE DATA. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WIRELESS AND FIBER OPTIC FREQUENCIES ARE SIX ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE OR ONE MILLION TIMES THIS MEANS FIBER OPTICS CAN CARRY OVER A MILLION TIMES MORE DATA. THE WIRELESS CAN.

WHICH IS AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE HIGHER THAN THE COST ESTIMATED IN THE ASSEMBLY REPORT- THIS IS A OBVIOUSLY A VERY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT THAT'S GOING TO INVOLVE REAL TRADE OFFS AND CHOICES FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. ALSO SOMEWHAT PERVERSE BECAUSE MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL FUNDS THIS YEAR AND- AND THEY ARE BEING ENCOURAGED OF THOSE FEDERAL MANDATES TO EXPLORE COURSES LIKE ETHNIC STUDIES. SO THIS BILL SHIPS. OF SORT OF A FEDERAL FISCAL OPPORTUNITY INTO A STATE ONGOING RESPONSIBILITY. WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT THE- THE BENEFITS COMING FROM THOSE COSTS AND- OVER A HUNDRED SCHOLARS HAVE SUBMITTED THE LETTER WHICH AFFORDED TO STAFF ABOUT THE- THE EFFECTIVENESSOF THIS CURRICULUM AND THEIR COLLUSION IS THAT- THE EFFECTIVENESS IS NOT BEEN SHOWN.
