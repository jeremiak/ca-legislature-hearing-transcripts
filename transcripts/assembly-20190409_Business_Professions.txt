AND JUST FOR A WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION AT UP TO TWO MINUTES FOR THIS BILL. SUMMER CALDERON WELCOME PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PRESENT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB ONE NINETY NINE THE CALIFORNIA ONLINE. NOTARIZED ATION ACT OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN NOW. I DON'T REMEMBER I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS KNOW THE LAST TIME YOU HAD TO USE A NOTARY BUT I REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I HAD TO USE A NOTARY AND IT WAS JUST LAST YEAR SO I DO NOT ONE WITHOUT FOR OFFICE YOU HAVE TO HAVE. YOUR PAPERS NOTARIZED IN ORDER TO FILE THAT YOU COULD DO THAT AT THE COUNTY OR IF YOU CAN'T GO MAKE IT DOWN THE COUNTY REGISTRAR'S OFFICE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A NOTARY COME MEET UP. AND WALK TO SIGN THE PAPER AND AUTHORIZES WELL THAT WAS MY SITUATION AND WHEN I DID THAT. THE ONLY TIME I COULD DO IT THAT MET UP WITH THE NET MIGHT. THAT THE TIME WITH THE NOTARY THAT I WAS GOING TO USE WAS WHEN MY WIFE PICKED ME UP. FROM THE AIRPORT AFTER FLYING HOME AFTER SESSION -- SO THAT I COULD GO WITH HER TO HER HAIR APPOINTMENT. SO THAT I CAN WATCH AT THAT TIME OUR EIGHT MONTH OLD -- BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANYBODY WATCHER AND I WAS COMING IN HER MOM COULD HELP I AND SO WHILE MY WIFE WAS GETTING HER HAIR DONE I HAD TO THEN GO INTO A HOTEL THAT WAS NEXT TO HER HAIR SALON. MEET WITH THE NOTARY AND HAVE. HER WATCH WE SIGNED THE PAPERS AND RIGHTS PAPERS VERIFY THAT I AM WHO I SAY I AM AND THAT WAS MY LAST EXPERIENCE THAT I HAD. WITH. A NOTARY SO [inaudible] BUT TECHNOLOGY AND THE INTERNET HAVE SIMPLIFIED MOST. ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS FOR EXAMPLE CONSUMERS CAN NOW SAFELY AND SECURELY APPLY FOR MORTGAGES ONLINE PROVIDE DOCUMENTATION THROUGH WEB PORTALS OF SMARTPHONES. AND CHECK THE STATUS OF THEIR APPLICATION ALL OVER THE INTERNET. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO NOTARIZED DOCUMENTS CALIFORNIANS ARE REQUIRED TO MEET IN PERSON WITH A NOTARY OR INVITE A MOBILE NOTARY INTO THEIR HOME WHICH CAN BE TIME CONSUMING AND BURDENSOME. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT UPDATES THIS ANTIQUATED SYSTEM BY AUTHORIZING REMOTE ONLINE NOTARIZED ATION CALIFORNIA? THIS MEASURE PERMITS WON'T PAN ON MY NOTARY APPROVED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO NOTARIZED A DOCUMENT WITH AN INDIVIDUAL WHO APPEARS BEFORE THE NOTARY BY SECURE TO WEIGH IN OUR INTERACTIVE VIDEO AND AUDIO AND VIDEO COMMUNICATIONS THE BILL DIRECTS THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO DROP REGULATIONS.

MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS PAT IS ANGELA I'M WITH KP PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSOCIATION. THE CALIFORNIA MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSOCIATION SUPPORTS AB ONE ANY NINE BECAUSE REMOTE ONLINE NOTIFICATION WILL UPDATE AND MAKE MORE CONVENIENT MORTGAGE TRANSACTIONS FOR CONSUMERS FOR NOTARIES AND FOR LENDERS WHILE ALSO ENSURING THE NECESSARY AUTHENTICATION AND SECURITY. THE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY IS SHIFTING FROM AN IN PERSON HEAVY PAPER PROCESS TO MORE STREAMLINED CONSUMER FRIENDLY TECHNOLOGY DRIVEN PROCESS. AND THE NEXT STEP IN DOING THAT IS TO IMPROVE A CLOSINGS THROUGH REMOTE REMOTE ONLINE ORDERS ATION OR RON. RON WOULD ALLOW CONSUMERS IN THE NOTARY TO BE IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND STILL SAFELY SIGN DOCUMENTS ELECTRONICALLY SO THE PROCESS FOR MORTGAGES IS IS BECOMING MORE TECHNOLOGY DRIVEN BUT WHEN YOU GET TO THE NOTRE IS ATION A PART OF THE PROCESS IT'S LIKE GOING BACK IN A TIME MACHINE. AT THAT POINT YOU'RE EITHER AS ASSEMBLYMAN CALDERON MENTION EITHER HEADING TO MEET IN ORDER YOUR NOBODY'S COMING TO YOU WHILE THE REST OF THE MORTGAGE PROCESS IS KEPT UP WITH THE TIMES THE CLOSING HAS NOT FOR THIS REASON WE SUPPORT THE BILL. AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COME FROM MIKE FROM NAME AND AFFILIATION IF YOU WISH TO DO SO. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MIKE BELOW FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING ANNA BACK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING EMILY HAPPENS ON BEHALF OF NOTARIZED IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS NEARLY FOR JOHN WITH MAKE YOU CAPTAIN ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CREDIT UNION LEAGUE IN SUPPORT. MORNING MY NAME IS TERRY VANDERBUR CEO SAFE DOCKS AND WE'RE HERE TO SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT SEEN ON ANY WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COME UP. TO THE TABLE HERE AND AGAIN WILL ALLOW UP TO THREE MINUTES OF IN TOTAL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PRESENT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AND ASSEMBLYMAN CAULDRON MY NAME IS MATT MILLER I'M AN ACTIVE CALIFORNIA NOTARY PUBLIC AND THE ORGANIZER PROPOSED AB. ONE NINETY NINE I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING INDEPENDENT NOTARIES AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION ALL OVER OUR STATE WE'RE NOT HERE TO STAND IN THE WAY OF PROGRESS BUT WE BELIEVE THIS BILL AS WRITTEN CONTRADICTS THE CURRENT CODE. WILL PUT NEW REASON THE PUBLIC A LARGE DIRECTLY INTO HARM'S WAY. TWO POINTS I WANTED TO POINT A CONCERN I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY OUR DATA PRIVACY CONCERNS AND LIABILITY ISSUES. CURRENTLY INFORMATION COLLECTED IN AN ETERNAL TRANSACTION IS A WRITTEN PROCESS AND IS MAINTAINED EXCLUSIVELY BY THE NOTARY NEVER SHARE TO PUT ON THE INTERNET AND SOUL. THIS DATA IS KEPT BY THE NUTRIENT TOLD RETIREMENT OR DEATH UPON WHICH TIME TO SURRENDER TO THE COUNTY CLERK FOR RECORDING. THE CORE A AS DESCRIBED IN ARTICLE TWO SECTION EIGHT TWO THREE ONE DOT SIX THIS BILL STATE THAT AN ONLINE NOTARY PUBLIC SO KEEP AN ELECTRONIC JOURNAL AND RECORD EACH ONLINE TO REACT PERFORMED INCLUDING IDENTITY INFORMATION CITY CHORES AND PHYSICAL LOCATION OF THE PRINCIPLE. ALSO THE PRINCIPAL MUST UPLOAD A COPY OF EVERY DOCUMENT BEING NOTARIZED TO THE ONLINE NOTARIES PLATFORM. HOWEVER THIS BILL CONTAINS NO LANGUAGE THAT PROTECTS THE PRINCIPLES ARE NOTARIES DATA FROM BEING MINED SHARED OR SOLD BY THE HANDFUL OF TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES HOSTING THE ONLINE PLATFORMS REQUIRED BY THIS BILL. NOR DOES THIS BILL ADDRESS DATA BREACHES OUTAGES OR DATA LOSSES THIS BILL ALSO DOES NOT DIRECTLY LINK THE TIME ELECTRONIC CHECK THE ACTUAL DATA MUST BE STORED. REGARDS TO EXCESSIVE LIABILITY ISSUES ACCORDING TO ARTICLE TWO SECTION EIGHT TWO THREE ONE DOT FIVE THIS BILL STATES THAT AN ONLINE NEW REPUBLIC MAY PERFORMER ON LATER IS SAFE FOR PRINCIPLE LOCATED ANYWHERE ON THE PLANET. IF THE ONLINE ORDERING HAS NO KNOWLEDGE THE NOTARY ACT IS PROHIBITED IN THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH THE PRINCIPLES LOOK AT THE TIME OF THE MILITARIZATION. SO AB ONE NINETY NINE IMPOSES AN IMPOSSIBLE NUDITY UPON NOTARIES TO CONFIRM THE LOCATION OF THE REMOTE SIGNER AND ANOTHER NOTARIAL LAWS OF ALL FIFTY STATES AND A HUNDRED NINETY FIVE SOVEREIGN STATES ON THE GLOW. IN THE STATE OF IOWA FOR EXAMPLE THE LAW INCLUDES A PROVISION THAT STATES NO RESERVATIONS PERFORMED IN ANOTHER STATE WILL ONLY BE RECOGNIZED IF THE SIGNER IS PHYSICALLY LOCATED BEFORE PHYSICALLY APPEARED BEFORE THE NOTARY. SO ULTIMATELY THIS BILL CREEK LIABILITY ISSUES FOR NOTARIES NEW RISING DOCUMENTS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO ENSURE THE LOCATION OF THE PRINCIPAL AND WHATNOT TERREL EXPERT HEADED IN THE JURISDICTION WHERE THE PRINCIPALS PHYSICALLY LOCATED. MEMBERS THESE ARE JUST A COUPLE OF OUR MANY CONCERNS THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO WHOM ALL ONE HUNDRED SIXTY SIX THOUSAND CALIFORNIA NO REPUBLICS ARE ACCOUNTABLE WAS OPPOSED TO THIS -- SAME BILL IN THE LAST SESSION FOR MULTIPLE CONCERNS OTHER THAN OUR OWN. DESPITE HAVING MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND THIS COMMITTEE THERE HAVE BEEN NO AMENDMENTS TO DATE SO MISTER CHAIRMAN WE RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU TABLE THIS BILL TODAY SO THE STAKEHOLDERS AND NOTARIES. CAN WORK TOGETHER WITH THE AUTHOR TO CRAFT A BETTER BILL THAT PROTECTS DATA PRIVACY AND ALIGNS WITH KERR NOTARIAL CODE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AND ASSEMBLYMAN CALDERON I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND ONE NOW YOU'LL THE FLOOR SO THAT OTHER OPPOSITION -- OTHER FOLKS IN OPPOSITION TO MAKE THE VOICE OF GREAT FIFTEEN SECONDS LEFT. A MISTER LOGAN'S RUN KINGSTON I REPRESENT THE ESCROW INSTITUTED CALIFORNIA. WE ARE PRINCIPALLY CONCERNED ABOUT ONE THING. WHEN WE SEE AN IRREGULARITY IN A NOTARIZED DOCUMENT? WE WON'T KNOW -- THE ENTERED THE ENFORCEMENT ENTITY. BECAUSE IF IT WAS RECORD IF THE AT THE ROOT A NOTARY WAS RECORDED IN CONNECTICUT FOR EXAMPLE NO DEA NO ENFORCEMENT ARM WILL GO THERE -- WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH. MISTER CALDERON -- WE HAVE MET WITH HIM HIS STAFF WE RECOGNIZE THE BILL SHOULD GO ON A COMMITTEE TODAY. AND ANY AMENDMENTS ARE REALLY CRITICALLY NECESSARY AS BEEN OUTLINED IN OUR THANK YOU LETTER AND I KNOW I NEED THANK YOU VERY MUCH DID YOU HAVE ANY SOME JUST SUMMARY COM. DID YOU HAVE A STATEMENT ON THE CALIFORNIA NOTARY IT'LL TAKE LESS THAN A MINUTE OKAY WOULD YOU CAN YOU DO IT IN FIFTEEN SECONDS. PLEASE JUST FIFTEEN SECONDS ON THE NOTARIAL ACT IS ALL ABOUT FRAUD PREVENTION PERSONAL APPEARANCES THE CORNERSTONE FOR THE PREVENTION OF FRAUD DURING A NOTARIAL ACT. WHEN WE DO THAT THROUGH THE FOLLOWING MEANS WE TOUCH THE SIGNERS IDENTIFICATION AND COMPARE THE IDEA TO THE PERSON BEFORE US AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WE LOOK AT AND TALK TO THE PERSON TO ASSESS WILLINGNESS AND DETERMINE MENTAL CAPACITY DURING THE NOTARIAL ACT? IF NEEDED WE ASK OTHERS TO LEAVE THE ROOM TO DO THIS THIS CANNOT BE RELIABLY ACCOMPLISHED REMOTELY DEPICT VIDEO TECHNOLOGY ISRAEL STEADILY ADVANCING AND OF DEEP CONCERN. SO THE TERMS REMOTE AND NOTRE IS ATION ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU BUT WE WANT TO BE FAIR WITH EVERYONE'S TIME. NOW IN ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION NAME AND AFFILIATION IF YOU WISH TO DO SO. HI MY NAME IS TERRY GILLETTE AND I'M A FULL TIME PROFESSIONAL NOTARY IN MARIN COUNTY I OPPOSE THIS BILL IT IS AS AS IT'S CURRENTLY WRITTEN FOR MANY REASONS. BUT EVER MOST IS THE LACK OF SECURITY FOR THE DOCUMENTS THAT RUN THROUGH THE ONLINE PROVIDER. THE NEXT TIME YOU ARE PERHAPS ONE OF YOUR KIDS BUYS A REFINANCE IS A HOME ALL THE INFORMATION ON YOUR LOAN APPLICATION WILL NOT BE SECURE. BECAUSE THERE'S NO ACCOUNTABILITY THROUGH THE PROCESS FOR THE SECURITY IT'S NOT JUST YOUR BANK BALANCES ON YOUR ACCOUNTS BUT ALSO YOUR ACCOUNT NUMBERS IT'S NOT JUST A CREDIT CARD BALANCES. BUT YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBERS -- IT'S NOT JUST YOUR HOUSE ADDRESS IT'S ALL THE ADDRESSES FOR THE PROPERTY THAT YOU OWN SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER MONTHLY INCOME IT TO ADDRESS. I RESPECTIVELY I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO VOTE NO ON THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I AM I AM A EVEN TOWARDS A NOTARY PUBLIC AND SPECIFICALLY A LOAN FINING AGENT I OPPOSE THIS BILL AS WRITTEN. OF THE NOTARY PUBLIC IS AN OATH TO FOLLOW THE LAWS AS WRITTEN AND ACCEPTS CONSEQUENCES. IF HE OR SHE FAILS IN THOSE DUTIES -- THIS LOOK UP I AM A NOTARY PUBLIC -- AN EXPERT LOAN FINING AGENT AND I UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO STREAMLINE THE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY -- BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT IT'S THE NUMBER THE NOTARY IS NOT THE BOTTLENECK THE ACTUAL -- LAST PROCESS OF POSING THAT IS ACTUALLY NOT WHERE THE BOTTLE NECK IS. SO THE BIT THE BILL AS WRITTEN I OPPOSE SO THAT IT CAN BE RE WRITTEN -- WITH THE HELP OF ACTUAL NOTARIES DURING THE CLOSING THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HI MY NAME IS SANDRA WINTERS AND I AM A NOTARY PUBLIC IN ANOTHER WE FIND AN AGENT I UNDERSTAND WITH THE BILL IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. BUT I HAVE. DONE THIRTY TWO YEARS WITH STATE OF CALIFORNIA I'M RETIRED NOW BUT I WAS A CONTRACT MANAGER AND I DID DO MULTI MILLION DOLLAR I. T. CONTRACT SO I UNDERSTAND. HOW IT'S IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA TO STAY UP ON TECHNOLOGY HOWEVER I AM OPPOSED TO THIS BILL BECAUSE I FEEL THAT IT'S NOT PROTECTED? THE CUSTOMER THAT WE SERVE AND ALSO FOR THE NOTABLY WHEN THE NOTARY NOTARIZED WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PERSON IS WHO THEY SAY THEY ARE EVEN IF WE USE THE BLACK LIGHT AGAINST THE FLASHLIGHT -- GETS THEIR ID CARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE WHO THEY ARE WE ALSO TAKE CLASSES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE IDENTIFIED THE PEOPLE PROPERLY WITHOUT THIS I THINK IT'S A HUGE LIABILITY FOR THE MOLD EVERYTHING YOU'LL START HAVING NOTARIES DROP OUT. THANK YOU VERY AND I THINK ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. YES PLEASE IF YOU COULD. THE COMMISSION MY PHONE. MY NAME IS FRANK ABOUT ECONOMIC CALIFORNIA REPUBLIC AYE OPPOSED THIS BILL AS IT IS WRITTEN BECAUSE EVERY NO REPUBLIC WOULD HAVE TO KNOW ALL. THE NOTARY LAWS IN ALL FIFTY STATES.

HELLO MY NAME IS JENNIFER HAD -- Là AND I'M A NOTARY PUBLIC AND ALONE CITING AGENT AND I OPPOSE THIS BILL. I BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THE PRIMARY DUTIES OF A NOTARY IS TO MEET WITH THE PERSON FACE TO FACE AND ALSO TO SEE THEIR ID IN PERSON. AND THIS BILL WOULD TAKE AWAY THAT POSSIBILITY I OPPOSE ONE NINETY NINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FIFTY MARK ON BEHALF OF SECRETARY STATE OUT EXPEDIA WERE A TWEENER WE JUST WANTED TO THANK THE MEMBER SO MUCH FOR ALL THEIR HARD WORK THE STATE. OF HOLDERS AND WE WE HAD CONCERNS LAST YEAR THAT WE STATED IN A LETTER VOTE OUT OF RESPECT FOR IT TO THE VERY GENUINE EARNEST AND OF VISIONARY -- VIEW THAT THE AUTHOR HAS FOR THE INTENT OF THE BILL WE HAVE NO FORMAL POSITION AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION FREE TO LINE UP AN APPROPRIATE FASHION IF THERE'S ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE LINE UP SO THIS IS THE FINAL PERSON IF I DON'T SEE ANYBODY ELSE. PLEASE GO AHEAD. I'M ANDREA AND I AM A NOTARY PUBLIC AND I OPPOSE THIS BILL. BECAUSE IT WOULD JUST MAKE IT TOO EASY FOR PEOPLE TO TRY TO MANIPULATE. THE SYSTEM VIA. BEING NOT FULLY VERIFIED IN PERSON THAT'S IT THANKS OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW WE'LL GO TO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

I AM IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL AND IS AS IT IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN AS IT DOES NOT SUPPORT THOSE OF US THAT DEPEND ON THIS IS OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF INCOME TO HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY. TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR CLIENTS AND PROTECT THE PLOT PUBLIC UNDER THE OATH THAT WE HAVE TAKEN. AS NOTARIES PUBLIC IT DOES NOT SUPPORT THAT THE TECHNOLOGIES. THAT ARE REQUIRED. ARE NOT IN REACH OF THOSE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND I THINK IT WOULD BE AN IMPACT OUR ECONOMY IN A NEGATIVE WAY SO AT THIS TIME I DO OPPOSE THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THEY GIVE TO EVERYONE WHO'S COME TO THE STATE CAPITOL TO PROVIDE YOUR TESTIMONY NOW I'M BRINGING THE CONVERSATION BACK TO THE BNP COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME. SEEM NO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME WE CURRENTLY -- ARE NOT ABLE TO DEVOTE TO THE LACK OF A QUORUM -- BUT A SIMILAR COLOR DO YOU WISH TO CLOSE YES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I JUST WANT TO DRESS A COUPLE THINGS --YOU KNOW WHEN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT -- AND BECOMES EFFECTIVE JENNER FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY AND WITH THAT LAW CALIFORNIA WILL LEAD THE NATION IN SANDERS FOR STANDARDS FOR DATA SECURITY THIS LANDMARK LEGISLATION REQUIRES DATA TO BE ENCRYPTED AND KEPT SAFE AND IN THE EVENT. OF A BREACH REQUIRES NOTIFICATION AND VERY STRONG REMEDIESTHIS BILL REQUIRES THE NOTARY TO PERFORM THE ACT WITHIN THEIR COMMISSIONING JURISDICTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH CALIFORNIA'S LAWS AND SUBJECT TO CALIFORNIA'S REGULATION AND SUPERVISION. MUCH AS THEY ARE ALLOWED TO DO IN THE TRADITIONAL PAPER NOTARY ACT SO THERE IS NO ISSUE OF A NOTARY TRYING TO PERFORM AN ACT IN. ANOTHER JURISDICTION AND FINALLY THIS BILL REQUIRES THE JOURNAL BE CAPPED UNDER SIMILAR STANDARDS TO PAPER NOTARIES. INCLUDING IT BE KEPT UNDER THE EXCLUSIVE CONTROL OF AN AN INDIVIDUAL NOTARY AND GIVEN TO A COUNTY CLERK AT THE TERMINATION OF THE COMMISSION. HOWEVER THE PRACTICAL SECURITY ASPECTS OF ONLINE PERFORMANCE GOODNESS ACETATE HAVING A SEPARATE JOURNAL FOR EACH PLATFORM WHICH IS SOMETHING WE WILL ALLOW THE NOTARY TO DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES. YOU KNOW THIS THIS BILL IS ABOUT CHOICE. NOBODY'S GONNA BE REQUIRED TO USE AN ONLINE NOTARY IT'S UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL TO MAKE THAT CHOICE CHANGE IS DIFFICULT EVERY TIME WE TRY TO DO SOMETHING NEW WE GET PUSHED BACK I UNDERSTAND IT. AS OPPOSITION FROM NOTARY TODAY THERE SIXTEEN OTHER STATES ARE CURRENTLY DO THIS NOT ONE POSITION OF ANYBODY THAT CAME FORWARD DID ANYBODY SAY FROM ANY ONE OF THOSE SIXTEEN STATES OR SOMETHING WRONG HAPPENS. OR THAT SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED SO WHY IS IT THAT IT CAN BE DONE RIGHT SIXTEEN OTHER STATE BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN WE TRY TO DO THIS IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE SO -- YOU KNOW. WHEN I MET WITH THAT MISTER VI&lt;c.cyan&gt; WE HAD A LOT OF&lt;/c&gt; CONVERSATIONS HIS HIS CONCERNS WERE MORE FOCUSED ON THE COST IMPLEMENTATION WHICH WERE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH HIS OFFICE ON? HAVE A GREAT WORKING RELATIONSHIP SO I'VE VERY CONFIDENT THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO TO GET TO IN. A MINIMAL POSITION WITH HIM -- AND THEN ALSO WHEN IT COMES TO NOT CARING ABOUT THE NOTARIES IN THEIR BUSINESS AYE I ABSOLUTELY DISAGREE -- THIS IS ABOUT ACCESS AND GOING ONLINE IS GOING TO PROVIDE FOR NEW BUSINESS NEW ACCESS MAKING THIS MORE ACCESSIBLE TO MORE PEOPLE WHICH I THINK WILL BE GET MORE CLIENTS AND SELL WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON AB. ONE NINETY NINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MAJORITY LEADER CALDERON -- SIMILARLY -- I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE ARTICULATED TO ADD TO OUR COMMITTEE THE UTILIZATION OF REMOTE -- NORMALIZATION AT AND THE UTILITY OF NEWER TECHNOLOGY THAT EXISTS TO ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE MUCH OF THE JOB CREATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL TOO I'VE ALSO STATED PUBLICLY THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION. AS THE BILL A SHOULD CONTINUE NOT AFFORD SO APPRECIATE THAT THE PUBLIC ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AS WELL TOO SO HAVING SAID THAT WE ARE ACTING AS A SUB COMMITTEE RIGHT NOW AND WILL TAKE UP THE BILL ME AS HAVE ESTABLISHED A QUORUM. THANK YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE NOW MOVE ON THEN TO A FILE ITEM NUMBER THREE WHICH IS BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL THIS IS ASSEMBLY BILL [inaudible] THREE EIGHTY SEVEN AGAIN ASSEMBLY [inaudible] MEMBER [inaudible] GABRIEL AB. THREE EIGHTY SEVEN ASSEMBLYMEMBER GABRIEL HELLO [inaudible] I KNOW. I HAVE A WITNESS I BELIEVE IS HEREBY TASK. NUMBER OKAY [inaudible] IF THERE [inaudible] ONE YEAH. ALL RIGHT SOUNDS LIKE HE'S COME. IT'S QUITE A CROWD OUT THERE YES IS THERE IS QUITE A CROWD JUST AS A AS A REMINDER WILL OUT UP TO THREE MINUTES FOR TESTIMONY. OF FOR ADDITIONAL WITNESSES AND SUPPORT AND UP TO THREE MINUTES FOR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OF COURSE THE AUTHORS FEEL FREE. TO TAKE OUR LONG AS YOU WISH BUT AGAIN THIS IS FILE ITEM NUMBER THREE WHICH IS AB. THREE EIGHTY SEVEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GABRIEL SIMILAR GABRIEL PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PRESENT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TODAY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL THREE EIGHTY SEVEN A BILL THAT WOULD MAKE. MINOR CHANGES TO PRESCRIPTION DRUG LABELING TO HELP AVOID CONFUSION REDUCE ERRORS AND IMPROVE PATIENT SAFETY. THE GENESIS OF THIS BILL IS A CONVERSATION I HAD WITH SOME SENIORS IN MY DISTRICT TO BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THE ENORMOUS COSTS OF ADVERSE DRUG EVENTS. CAUSED BY CONFUSION AROUND PRESCRIPTION DRUG LABELING. THE ISSUE RESONATED WITH ME BECAUSE IT WAS CONSISTENT WITH MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE SEVERAL YEARS AGO MY GRANDFATHER SUFFERED A SCARY EPISODE WHEN HE WAS TRAVELING IN CONFUSED TWO OF HIS MEDICATIONS. AS I LOOKED INTO THE ISSUE I WAS STRUCK BY THE DATA WHICH DEMONSTRATES THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM. DUE TO MEDICATIONS WITH SIMILAR NAMES ARE ESTIMATED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THOUSANDS OF DEATHS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN COSTS EVERY YEAR. IN FACT EACH YEAR ADVERSE DRUG OFFENSE ACCOUNT FOR SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS A HUNDRED THOUSAND HOSPITALIZATIONS AND COST THE U. S. HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS. THIS BILL PROVIDES AN EASY WAY TO PREVENT THOSE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES BY ENCOURAGING PHYSICIANS TO WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF A DRUG ON ITS PRESCRIPTION LABEL WHICH HELPS REMIND PATIENTS WHICH MEDICATION IS FOR WHICH ELEMENT. THE FIX IS A SIMPLE AS ADDING TWO OR THREE WORDS FOR EXAMPLE WRITING FOR ASTHMA OR FOR BLOOD PRESSURE OR FOR BACK PAIN AT THE END OF A LABEL. THE OPTION IS ALREADY AVAILABLE FOR PATIENTS THIS BILL MERELY CHANGES THE CURRENT SYSTEM FROM AN OPT IN TO AN OPT OUT. THE BILL ALSO PRESERVES PATIENT PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY SINCE WHAT IF ANYTHING IS PRINTED ON THE LABEL IS ENTIRELY THE PATIENT'S DISCRETION. THE PATIENT CAN DECIDE NOT TO HAVE ANYTHING PRINTED ON THE LABEL OR THE PHYSICIAN CAN DESCRIBE THE PURPOSE OF THE MEDICATION AT A HIGH LEVEL OF GENERALITY SUCH AS FOR INFECTION THAT WILL NOT DISCLOSE ANY SENSITIVE INFORMATION. I'M ALSO PLEASED TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS FROM THE PHARMACIST AND RETAILERS AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH PHYSICIANS TO ADDRESS THEIR IMPLEMENTATION CONCERNS. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT FOR SOME PATIENTS ESPECIALLY SENIORS THERE CAN BE SEVERE CONSEQUENCES FOR FAILING TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN TWO MEDICATIONS THAT LOOK OR SOUND ALIKE. ADDING A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE PURPOSE OF A MEDICATION TO ITS LABEL IS AN EASY WAY TO AVOID CONFUSION REDUCE ERRORS AND IMPROVE PATIENT SAFETY. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE AND WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS TED TOP IN REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA STATE RETIREES. STOPPING. YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TED TOP IN FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE RETIREE STRONGLY IN SUPPORT. THIS IS A BILL WE'VE SUPPORTED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS IN THE CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE -- A PRETTY WERE THE PURPOSE WE WOULD SAY A SIMPLE DESCRIPTION OF WHAT A JUDGE PURPOSES. THAT WILL LIMIT. DRUG ADVERSE FACTS AND EVENTS. AND LEAD. TO IMPROVED HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR DOT JUST RETIREES AND SENIORS BUT ALL CALIFORNIANS. MERGER AYE VOTE. ARE THERE ANY OF WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. YOU PLEASE COME FORWARD AND STATE YOUR NAME. IT WILL BE READY FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. YOU MAY PROCEED. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MAKING ALL RIGHT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. THEME IS REGRETFULLY OPPOSED TO AB THREE SEVEN AS IT RAISES SERIOUS PRIVACY CONCERNS ADDS EVEN MORE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS TO PHYSICIANS AND IS NOT NECESSARY AS THE ABILITY TO HAVE THE REASON FOR PRESCRIPTION PRINTED. ON THE PRESCRIPTION LABEL IS ALREADY AVAILABLE TO PATIENTS AB THREE TO SEVEN WOULD REQUIRE A POSITION TO PUT THE REASON FOR PRESCRIPTION ON THE LABEL OF EVERY PRESCRIPTION WRITTEN FOR A DRUG OR DEVICE. WELL THE AUTHOR INTENDED FLEXIBILITY. BY USING THE TERM REASON FOR THE PRESCRIPTION WE INTERPRET THAT REASON TO BE THE DIAGNOSIS WHICH THE DRUG IS BEING PRESCRIBED TO TREAT. SO UNDER THIS BILL EVERY PATIENT'S DIAGNOSIS WHICH REQUIRES TREATMENT. WOULD BE PRINTED ON THE LABEL OF ALL OF THEIR PRESCRIPTIONS UNLESS THEY AFFIRMATIVELY OPTED OUT. THIS RAISES SERIOUS PRIVACY CONCERNS AS A DIAGNOSIS. OR REASON NECESSITATING MEDICATION IS CONFIDENTIAL AND SENSITIVE INFORMATION SHARED BETWEEN A PATIENT AND THEIR POSITION. PATIENTS MAY VERY WELL NOT WANT THEIR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION SHARED WITH THEIR PHARMACIST PHARMACY TECH. OR ANYONE ELSE THAT MIGHT COME ACROSS THEIR PRESCRIPTION LABEL. THEY'RE ALSO IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES TO THIS PROVISION. SUCH AS HOW MANY TIMES A PATIENT WOULD HAVE TO OPT OUT IF THEY DIDN'T WANT THEIR DIAGNOSIS ON THE PRESCRIPTIONS. WOULD BE ONCE AND COVER ALL MEDICATIONS OR WHAT IT HOW WOULD THEY HAVE TO OPT OUT FOR EACH MEDICATION WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF A PATIENT SENT A MESSAGE THEIR POSITION AND THE POSITION THEN EAT PRESCRIBE MEDICATION. WITHOUT THE PATIENT HAVING A CHANCE TO OPT OUT. THESE IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES ALSO RAISE THE SECOND MAJOR CONCERN WHICH IS THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN. WE FREQUENTLY DISCUSSED THAT THE HIGH COST OF HEALTHCARE AND POSITION ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN AS A DRIVER OF THESE COSTS THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE PHYSICIAN TO ASK EVERY PATIENT FOR EVERY PRESCRIPTION. IF THEY WANTED THEIR MEDICATION LABELED WHETHER DIAGNOSIS OR REASON FOR NEEDING THE MEDICATION. THE SIX CRITICAL TIME AWAY FROM THE ALREADY TIME CRINGED APPOINTMENTS FINALLY THESE PRIVACY CONCERNS ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS COULD BE ALLEVIATE ALLEVIATED. BY SIMPLY UTILIZING THE MECHANISM IN PLACE CURRENTLY WHICH ALLOWS FOR A PATIENT TO REQUEST THE SPECIFIC REASON OR DIAGNOSIS INFORMATION TO BE PRINTED ON THEIR PRESCRIPTION LABEL. AND THEN REQUIRES THAT THE INFORMATION TRANSMITTED TO THE PHARMACY IS PLACED ON THE LABEL OF MAKING MAJOR TROUBLE FOR WOMAN SO WE CAN A SUBSEQUENT PLEASE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LOW. HERE BROKE. BLOOM GEN [inaudible] JILL [inaudible] CUNNINGHAM. DALY EGGMAN FONG. GIPSON. GLORIA GRAYSON. HOLDEN. IRWIN. MCCARTY MEDINA MULLIN. PROBLEMATIC [inaudible] THANKS [inaudible] WHAT? THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE BELIEVE THE CURRENT MECHANISM FOR LABELING CAN BE AS ACTIVE AND SUFFICIENT IF UTILIZED BY THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO HAVE THIS INFORMATION PRINTED ON THE LABEL AND FOR THESE REASONS WE BRAG REMAIN OPPOSED AB THREE TO SEVEN THANK YOU. JENNIFER SNYDER BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION AND THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CHAIN DRUG STORES FIRST WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING AMENDMENTS THAT ADDRESSED -- A FEW OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE DID REYES WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THAT AND HOPE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR -- AS WE CONTINUE TO RAISE A FEW MORE CONCERNS LIKE TO ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE -- BRACE BY MAKING HER WITH CMA THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION -- WE CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT PATIENT PRIVACY ABOUT CONDITION ON THE LABEL THAT MIGHT BE AN OFF LABEL USE OF THAT DRUG AND THE ABILITY FOR US TO FOR OUR PHARMACISTS ABOUT ACTUALLY BE ABLE -- TO PLACE THE CONDITION ON THE LABEL AND HAVE THAT LABEL BE ABLE TO BE READ I'M NOT KNOWING EXACTLY HOW LONG THAT CONDITION SHOULD BE. I'M MORE CONCERNED THAT PATIENTS MAY NOT WANT TO HAVE THE CONDITION ON THEIR LABEL AND ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT LIABILITY ISSUES IF AGAIN IF IT'S AN OFF LABEL USE -- THE CONDITION IS NOT. DIRECTLY AFFILIATED WITH WHAT THE FDA APPROVES FOR THAT DRUG -- AGAIN WE DO APPRECIATE THE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN -- THEY THEY ACTUALLY DRESSED AND ONE OF THE NUMBER ONE CONCERNS FOR OUR PHARMACIES WAS IF OF POSITION DOES NOT HAVE THE CONDITION ON THE PRESCRIPTION AS IT COMES TO THE PHARMACY WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PHARMACY HAVING TO FOLLOW UP. AND WITH EVERY PHYSICIAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT CONDITION WAS ON THE LABEL SO WE DO APPRECIATE THAT THAT. WAS ADDRESSED IN THE AMENDMENTS HI MY HOPE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR OF IT AND DO HAVE CONTINUED CONCERNS WITH THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE FEEL FREE TO LINE UP HERE AT THE MICROPHONE THEY CAN THIS IS WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION FOR AB THREE EIGHTY SEVEN PLEASE FEEL FREE TO LINE ABOUT THE MICROPHONE IF YOU WISH. TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AGAIN NAME IN FILIATION IF YOU WISH TO DO SO. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RANDALL HAGER FOR THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION JUST REAL BRIEFLY. IF A MENTAL HEALTH OR A PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSIS IS PUT ON A LABEL AND AND IT'S DONE SO INADVERTENTLY. COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS DO A COMPANY MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS GOING TO BE CERTAIN THAT THAT -- INDIVIDUAL WHAT WE CHOOSE TO OPT OUT -- A TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD WITH BI POLAR. AND HAVING THAT FACT DISCLOSED -- COULD HAVE THAT CONSEQUENCE FOLLOW THEM THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFE AND THAT IS A VERY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCE AN OUTCOME. TO SO FOR THOSE REASONS WERE OPPOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. SEEN NONE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS NOW FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I MISSED THE MISTER GABRIEL TO BEGINNING OUR THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS YEAR YOU'RE ACCEPTING US I YES SIR. BUT I'D. I THINK YOU'RE TACKLING A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE I THINK THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS REALLY MAKE THE BILL A LOT BETTER. IN MY OPINION IT IT SHIFTS ME -- TO POSITION OF OPPOSED TO POSITION OF YOU KNOW TRYING TO GET TO SUPPORT -- ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAD THOUGH REGARDS THE LANGUAGE FOR OPT OUT AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONFUSION ABOUT THAT AND I'VE HAD PEOPLE ASK ME. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN THAT -- YOU HAVE TO OPT OUT -- EVERY SINGLE TIME IN OTHER WORDS IS THE PHYSICIAN REQUIRED TO HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH THE PATIENT FOR EVERY PRESCRIPTION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO OPT OUT OR IS THE PAY IS IF THE PATIENT'S RESPONSIBILITY TO SAY HEY I'D LIKE TO OPT OUT. YEAH I THINK THAT'S IN AN ACTUAL QUESTION AND AND THANK YOU FOR THAT IN THIS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT -- I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY DISCUSS WITH CMA YESTERDAY UNFORTUNATELY TO HAVE A CHANCE TO TO MEET IN PERSON AND UNTIL YESTERDAY AFTERNOON -- WE'RE CERTAINLY OPEN TO ANY KIND OF CONVERSATION TO IT REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN SUPPORT THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS NOT. TO PLACE AN ADDITIONAL MYSTERY TO BIRDS ON PHYSICIANS WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE OVERWORKED IT'S TWO IN APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES TRIGGER THIRTY SECOND CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE PATIENT AND THEIR PHYSICIAN WHICH THEY CAN. THE THE THE PATIENT CAN MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY THEY WANT TO OPT OUT IF THERE'S SOME KIND OF BLANKET OPT OUT FORM THAT'S ACCEPTABLE TO THE PATIENT THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE BE OPEN TO PUTTING IN AS WELL -- AND AND WE'VE EXPRESSED OUR ARE ARE VERY SINCERE DESIRE TO WORK WITH THOSE WERE IN OPPOSITION TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MINIMIZE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS WHILE STILL PRESERVING FOR THE PATIENT. THE RIGHT TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO HAVE TWO OR THREE WORDS PRINTED ON THE LABEL THAT MIGHT HELP REMIND THEM WHY THEY'RE TAKING A CERTAIN PRESCRIPTION. GREAT I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION I THINK THAT THOSE PROVISIONS WOULD MAKE THE BILL BETTER AND I THINK AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD HERE. I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU TO CONTINUE THOSE DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE I THINK YOU NEED SOME MORE LANGUAGE IN THERE TO TO REALLY CLEARLY DEFINED WHAT IT MEANS TO OPT OUT -- TO TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THAT THAT'S NOT OBLIGATION IN A POSITION IT'S AN OPTION FOR THE PATIENT -- AND ALSO MAYBE TO LOOK AT OTHER SECTIONS OF CODE FOR LANGUAGE THAT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT ONCE YOU'VE OPTED OUT YOU CAN OPT THAT OPT OUT CAN BE -- APPLY PERMANENTLY RATHER THAN HAVING TO OPT OUT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO CONTINUING THIS CONVERSATIONS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS ALL THOSE IS AGAINST THE ILLUSTRATE THE GREAT WORK OF A COMMITTEE STAFF AS WELL SO THANK YOU FOR THAT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT WOULD THEN GO TO DOCTOR EGGMAN FALL BY DOCTOR WOULD. I THINK YOU -- I THINK YOU BRING THIS IMPORTANT BILL FORWARD I THINK IT'S I'VE WORKED A LOT WITH THE SENIOR LEGISLATURE ALSO. AND I KNOW THEY HAVE A LOT OF PASSION ABOUT A LOT OF ISSUES -- I'VE I'VE EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS ABOUT ABOUT THIS BILL AND NOT WELL WELL I THINK IT PROBABLY NEEDS TO GO FORWARD I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT TODAY -- AS SOMEONE WHOSE WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO FOR WHOM CONFIDENTIALITY IS NO POURTANT ISSUE I YOU KNOW PEOPLE GO WHEN PEOPLE'S BATHROOMS THEY OPEN THEIR CABINETS I DON'T KNOW IF EVERYBODY WANTS TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE BEING TREATED. FOR DEPRESSION OR RECTAL DYSFUNCTION OR VENEREAL DISEASE OR WHATEVER THE PLETHORA OF THAT PEOPLE MIGHT BE BEING TREATED -- FOR SO I GUESS I JUST SEE IT MORE A LITTLE BIT MORE COMMONSENSE RATHER THAN. AN AUTOMATIC OPT IN WHY NOT JUST HAVE THE PHYSICIAN ASK THE PATIENT. WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPT IN. VERSES AND A MANDATORY OPTION SO THAT'S TO ME THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE COMMONSENSE OR IF IT'S IF IT'S FOR SENIORS THAT WE'RE TARGETING THEN MAKE IT. ALTHOUGH I'M I'M APPROACHING AT SIXTY FIVE OR OLDER -- VERSUS BEING A BLANKET FOR FOR EVERYBODY. SO THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS AND AND I LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE TO SEE THIS MOVE FORWARD AND WORKING ON THIS BILL. I THINK IT'S AN INTERESTING. ISSUE BUT I THINK JUST ASKING PEOPLE IF THEY WOULD LIKE THAT INFORMATION ON THEIR LABEL MIGHT BE AN EASIER WAY THAN JUST MANDATING IT BE ON THERE FOR EVERYBODY. YEAH I AND I I JUST TO TO BE CLEAR IF I MIGHT RESPOND ESTHER CHAIR THANK YOU -- YOU KNOW OUR ART THE ATTENTION OF THE BILLS TO TRIGGER A CONVERSATION BETWEEN AND I I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHAT'S REQUIRED AS A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE PHYSICIAN AND THE PATIENT -- AND WE'VE PURPOSELY CRAFTER THE LANGUAGE DOESN'T REQUIRE THE DIAGNOSIS RIGHT IT REQUIRES THE PURPOSE AND LEAVES UP TO THE DISCRETION OF BOTH ULTIMATELY THE PATIENT BUT ALSO THE FISH PHYSICIAN. THE LEVEL OF GENERALITY WHICH TO DESCRIBE IT SO YOU CAN IMAGINE A SITUATION WHERE THERE'S SOMETHING THAT SENSITIVE OR THE KIND OF DIAGNOSIS THAT SOMEONE MIGHT WANT TO KEEP CONFIDENTIAL IT'S A 100% IN THE PATIENT'S. DISCRETION AT THAT POINT TO ASK THE PHYSICIAN OR TO HAVE A CONVERSATION POSITIONS A NOW. I PREFER THAT THAT NOT BE ON THE LABEL AND THERE'S NOTHING HERE THAT WOULD PREVENT THE PHYSICIAN FROM SAYING TO THE PATIENT MIGHT I SUGGEST THAT WE NOT PUT THIS ON THE LABEL RIGHT SO IT'S I I THINK IT'S IT JUST LEAVE THE FLEXIBILITY FOR VERY COMMONSENSE APPROACH. IT ALSO IT THE THE LEVEL OF GENERALITY WHICH SOMETHING IS DESCRIBED IS IS UP TO THE IS UP TO THE PHYSICIAN AND THE PATIENT HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT RIGHT SO. RATHER THAN SAYING YOU KNOW FOR VENEREAL DISEASE YOU COULD CHECK FOR INFECTION OR SOMETHING AT A AT A AT A HIGH LEVEL OF GENERALITY THAT WON'T DISCLOSE ANY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. STILL PROVIDE A TRIGGER OR REMINDER IF THE PATIENT WANTS. ONE WITHOUT RECALL WITHOUT DISCLOSING ANY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND YOUR FINAL POINT ABOUT AGE YES WE HAVE HEARD A LOT OF CONCERNS FROM SENIORS ABOUT THIS. BUT WE'VE ALSO HEARD FROM FOLKS ABOUT THE CARE GIVERS OF SENIORS WHO MAY WANT TO BE REMINDED IF THERE'S A LOT OF MEDICATIONS. AND ALSO FOR PARENTS RIGHT TO HAVE CHILDREN WHO MAY HAVE -- A VARIETY OF AILMENTS MAYBE ON A LOT OF DRUGS IN THEIR MINISTERING ALONE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TRUCKS TO THEIR CHILDREN TO HAVE A REMINDER ON THE BOTTLE -- OF WHICH DRUGS FOR WHICH EMMET CAN HELP THEM TO AVOID CONFUSION BECAUSE THE NAMES OF THESE MEDICATIONS ARE SO LONG SO COMPLICATED ARE OFTEN COMMON NAMES THAT ARE EASY TO CONFUSE AND SO THIS IS JUST ABOUT ADDING TWO OR THREE WORDS. AT THE PATIENT SELECTION TO HELP AVOID THAT CONFUSION WHICH ARE WE SEEN AS A WRIT IS A REAL ISSUE IT'S IT'S ASSAULTING IN DEATH IT'S COSTING OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. WE THINK THERE'S AN EASY FIX HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR WHAT. YES I WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER GABER FOR BRING THIS BILL FORWARD -- IT KIND OF MAKES ME REFLECT ON WHEN I WAS PRESCRIBING ON A REGULAR BASIS I WOULD ROUTINELY. THIS IS BEING PRESCRIBED FOR PAIN THIS IS BEING PRESCRIBED -- FOR INFECTION I DID THAT -- MAKES ME NOW WONDER IF I'M IN VIOLATION OF SOMETHING -- BUT BUT BECAUSE I KNEW THAT MY PATIENTS DIDN'T ALWAYS KNOW. WHAT THE THIS PARTICULAR MEDICATIONS WERE? FOR NOW AS I CARE FOR MY MY MOTHER WHO HAS -- SOME COGNITIVE ISSUES -- AND IN SHARING THAT CARE WITH TWO BROTHERS WHO HAVE NO EXPERIENCE IN HEALTH CARE -- AND SHE'S TAKING A MYRIAD OF MEDIC MEDICATIONS AND BEING ASSISTED BY AN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY THERE -- TRYING TO KEEP TRACK OF WHAT THE DIFFERENT MEDICATIONS ARE FOR IS A CHALLENGE WHEN YOU DEAL WITH MULTIPLE PARTIES SO I I COMPLETELY APPRECIATE THE PRIVACY CONCERNS. BUT I ALSO AND GET CONCERNED THAT THERE IS POTENTIAL CONFUSION AND THAT A PATIENT A PERSON MIGHT ACTUALLY END UP TAKING THE WRONG MEDICATIONS ARE TOO MUCH OF THE WRONG MEDICATIONS -- AND SO -- YOU KNOW I CAN'T CONTROL SOMEONE GOING INTO SOMEBODY'S -- HOUSE AND AND DO THAT AND I CERTAINLY DON'T EXPECT THE PEOPLE ARE WALKING AROUND WITH ALL THESE MEDICATIONS AROUND THEIR NECKS AND I CAN NECKLACE. SO -- SO I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING -- WASN'T EVEN AWARE THAT -- THERE WAS -- AN OPT IN POTENTIAL OUT THERE BECAUSE I JUST ROUTINELY WE CAN PRESCRIBE A LOT OF THAT IS REALLY DIDN'T PRESCRIBE THINGS IN DENTISTRY. THAT WOULD RAISE A LOT OF EYEBROWS SO THEY'RE A COUPLE MEDICATIONS THAT PEOPLE MIGHT WONDER ABOUT. BUT BUT SO I APPRECIATE WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY AND I HOPE THAT AS I I KNOW YOU COMMIT TO CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS. AND PRIVACY CONCERNS ARE AN ISSUE BUT I ALSO THINK -- SAFETY IS AN ISSUE -- FOR PEOPLE AND AND AND SOME SENIORS ARE HAVING SCHOOL HAVING HAVING CHALLENGES SO I APPRECIATE PRETTY WEIRD WHICH WERE YOU TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GAME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AS A MEMBER GRAYSON THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THE MISTER REAL THANK YOU FOR THIS LEGISLATION. I REALLY APPRECIATED COMING FORWARD AND I UNDERSTAND THE SITE ABOUT WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE -- SOME KIND OF IDENTIFIER ON THE LABEL TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE TAKING THE RIGHT PRESCRIPTIONS -- AT THE SAME TIME I ALSO UNDERSTAND THE PRIVACY CONCERNS -- SPECIALLY THAT MY COLLEAGUE DR EGGMAN BROUGHT UP AS WELL I SURE THOSE CONCERNS A SHE ARTICULATED A LOT MORE A LOT BETTER THAN I COULD -- SO I FIND MYSELF IN A A PLACE TODAY WHERE I'D PROBABLY NOT GOING TO VOTE ON THIS BUT I DO LOOK FOR TO SUPPORTING IT. AS IT MOVES FORWARD WITH THE CONTINUED WORK THAT YOU HAVE COMMITTED TO DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. THE ONE THING THAT -- DID CATCH ME REAL QUICK WAS THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT JUST INITIATING A FIFTEEN SECOND CONVERSATION WITH THE WITH THE DOCTOR AND THAT WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR MORE ADMINISTRATIVE. COULD NOT ALREADY BE DONE NOW WITH THE FIFTEEN SECONDS -- CONVERSATION WHERE THE DOCTOR ADDRESSES THE PATIENT SAYS WOULD YOU LIKE ME -- TO PUT THIS ON THE PRESCRIPTION LABEL -- OR IS IT IN YOUR ESTIMATION ABSOLUTE NECESSARY THAT WE SWITCH OF FROM AN OPT IN TO AN OPT OUT. I I'M NOT SURE -- BY THE WAY THE CONVERSATION TO TAKE PLACE SO. YEAH I THINK I THINK THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I APPRECIATED -- AND AND ALSO THE VERY CIRCUIT SINCE YOUR PRIVACY CONCERNS AND UNDERSTAND THOSE -- THE THE THE THINKING ABOUT GOING FROM -- IN OPT INTO AN OPT OUT IS WHEN IT'S AN OPTION IT REQUIRES THE PATIENT TO KNOW THAT SO YOU THERE BEEN SOME SUGGESTION THAT RATHER DURING THIS BILL WE SHOULD DO AN EDUCATION CAMPAIGN BUT AT THAT POINT WE'RE GONNA TRY TO EDUCATE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE. ABOUT THE SPECIFIC RIGHT THAT THEY HAVE WHO HAVE LESS INTERACTION WITH THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM MAY ONLY GET A COUPLE OF PRESCRIPTIONS A YEAR -- VERSUS GOING TO THE FOLKS WHO ARE PRESCRIBING MEDICATION PRESUMABLY EVERY DAY -- HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH THEM AND JUST PUTTING ON THEM -- THE ONUS TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH THEIR PATIENTS AND YOU KNOW I'VE EXPRESSED TO TO SEE A MAN TO OTHERS -- WILLINGNESS -- TO STRUCTURE THE IMPLEMENTATION IN A WAY THAT WOULD BE FEASIBLE TO PERHAPS HAVE DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION GIVE THEM TIME TO TO TRAIN AND WORK WITH PHYSICIAN SO THAT THEY'RE AWARE OF THIS REQUIREMENT. AND PHASE IT IN IT IN A WAY THAT WOULD BE -- THE MOST AMENABLE FOR THAT SO I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF YOU KNOW WHAT DO WE DO WE NEED TO WE EDUCATE FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS ABOUT THE RIGHT TO OPT IN OR DO WE ASK FORTY FOUR THOUSAND PHYSICIANS HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THEIR PRESERVE. WITH THEIR PATIENTS ABOUT THIS AND WE JUST THOUGHT IT WAS A MUCH MORE EFFICIENT TO TO TO HAVE THE PHYSICIAN INITIATE THE CONVERSE AYE. AYE AYE WHAT A GREAT RESPONSE AND SITTING RIGHT BESIDE DR WITH HERE AND HAVING HIM SAY I WASN'T EVEN AWARE THAT THERE WAS AN OPT IN WAS -- INTERESTING THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER GIBSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT TO THANK THE OFFER BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU AND I HAVE HAD CONVERSATION WITH RESPECT TO THIS BILL I KNOW THAT THEIR THIS IS SOMETHING.

BILL PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PRESENT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE CHAIR IN HIS STAFF FOR ALL OF THEIR EFFORTS WORKING WITH ME. AND THE OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL TO REACH A CONCEPTUAL CREAM AND ON THE BILL'S FRAMEWORK AND AMENDMENTS. AS SUCH WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. IT IS A ONE THANK BOTH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IN THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION NURSE PRACTITIONERS THE COMPROMISE IS BOTH GROUPS WERE WILLING TO MAKE TO HELP US LAND ON THE AGREED UPON FRAMEWORK WE HAVE TODAY. I KNOW IT WASN'T EASY FOR EITHER PARTY. I INTEREST IN THIS ISSUE WAS PROMPTED BY A GROWING REALIZATION THAT MANY DIFFERENT STRATEGIES I HAVE SUPPORTED TO HELP INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. WAS JUST NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH. WE CANNOT FIND ENOUGH RESIDENCY PROGRAMS FOR LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAMS TO MEET THE HEALTHCARE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY THOSE IN RURAL AND UNDERSERVED URBAN AREAS. IT'S BEEN A YEAR AND A HALF ON THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION WORKFORCE COMMISSION WORKING WITH STATEWIDE LEADERS IN THE AREAS OF HEALTH LABOR GOVERNMENT TO DEVELOP A PLAN TO ME CALIFORNIA'S WORKED OF COURSE NEEDS. FOR THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS. ALLOWING. THERE'S PRACTITIONERS FULL SCOPE AUTHORITY WAS ONE THAT REPORTS TOP RECOMMENDATIONS THE BILL FOR BEFORE YOU HAS THREE KEY COMPONENTS FIRST ARE THE PATHWAYS TO PRACTICING UNSUPERVISED. THE NURSE PRACTITIONER CAN EITHER WORK AS A PART OF AN INTEGRATED TEAM WHAT THEY WANT TO PRACTICE OUTSIDE THOSE SETTINGS THERE IS A REQUIREMENT FOR A THREE YEAR TRANSITION TO PRACTICE. WHICH ONE BALL COMPENSATE MONEY WILLS AND AN EXAM. SECOND IS A REGULATORY STRUCTURE INCLUDING A NEWLY CREATED BOARD OF ADVANCED PRACTICE REGISTERED NURSING IT TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE NEED FOR PHYSICIAN INPUT AND INVOLVEMENT WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF MAINTAINING A SINGLE STANDARD OF CARE. THIRD IS AN APPROACH THAT PRESERVES THE CORPORATE BAN ON THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. SO THE PRACTICE IN PEACE WILL BE TREATED IN THE SAME MANNER AS PHYSICIANS WHILE ALSO PRESERVING THE ABILITY OF NURSE PRACTITIONERS TO REMAIN EMPLOYEES. THEY CHOOSE BUT WITH DIFFERENT RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES THAN THOSE REPORTED AUTONOMOUS. AND NURSE PRACTITIONERS ON ON A HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF. I BELIEVE THIS RISK FRAMEWORK RIGHT REPRESENTS A BALANCE BETWEEN GREATER AUTONOMY AND A CAUTIOUS APPROACH TO SERVE AS JURORS ADDITIONAL CLINICAL EXPERIENCE AND MENTORSHIP PRIOR TO ALLOWING AND THEN P.. TO WORK OUTSIDE AN INTEGRATED SETTING WE STILL HAVE ISSUES TO ADDRESS INCLUDING HOW TO TRANSITION INTO THE NEW PRACTICE ENVIRONMENT WAS EXISTING MPS WHO HAVE BEEN MANY YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE. AS WELL SOME PRACTICAL ISSUES INVOLVING THE TRANSITION TO A NEW REGULATORY BOARD. AND CONTENT I COMMITTED TO WORK ON THESE ISSUES AND AGAIN I WISH TO THANK ALL INVOLVED FOR THEIR PATIENTS AND THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS PROPOSAL. WITH ME TODAY'S ADRIN SHELTON WITH THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE AND HER SUBJECT MATTER SUSAN CHAPMAN. WE CAN. BUILD ON FIVE MINUTES OF FOR WHEN THIS IS INTO A TALLY FOR SUPPORT AND THEN UP TO FIVE MINUTES IN OPPOSITION SO PLEASE FEEL FREE PRESENT. GOOD MORNING MR CHERRY MEMBERS ADRIAN SHELTON WITH THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE AND WE ARE PROUD TO SUPPORT AB EIGHT NINETY TODAY. THE SUMMER INSTITUTE IS COMING OUT THIS ISSUE FROM AN ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE PERSPECTIVE. WE KNOW FROM RECENT STUDIES THAT TWO THIRDS OF CALIFORNIA ADULTS WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS ARE NOT RECEIVING TREATMENT. AS WELL AS TWO THIRDS OF ADOLESCENTS WITH SERIOUS DEPRESSIVE CONDITIONS ARE ALSO NOT RECEIVING TREATMENT. WE SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH OF OUR WORK FORCE ARE HEALTH WORKFORCE IN THE RIGHT PLACES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR GROWING. AGING AND INCREASINGLY DIVERSE POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA AND SO THAT'S WHAT HAS BROUGHT US TO THIS ISSUE TODAY AND WHY WE ARE SUPPORTING AB. EIGHT NINETY I AM VERY PLEASED TO INTRODUCE SUSAN CHAPMAN WHO IS A PROFESSOR AT THE UCSF SCHOOL OF NURSING AT A SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT ON THIS TOPIC. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OFTHE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SUSAN CHAPMAN AND I AM A PROFESSOR UCSF IN THE SCHOOL OF NURSING AND I AM PROUD TO SUPPORT AB. EIGHT NINETY I TRAINED AS A PSYCH NURSE MANY YEARS AGO AND WORKED IN THE FIELD FOR ABOUT EIGHT YEARS BEFORE RETURNING TO ACADEMIC WORK. I'M NOW ON THE FACULTY AT UCSF AND I TEACH HEALTH POLICY TO NURSES. I'M HERE TO TALK BUT I ALSO DO WORK FORCE RESEARCHING OF DONE THAT FOR ABOUT TWENTY YEARS. I'M HERE TO TALK TO ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT PSYCH MENTAL HEALTH AND PEACE ARE TO ADDRESSING OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORK FORCE CRISIS. AS ADRIAN MENTIONED WE HAVE A CRISIS US 17% OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE OF MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS AND ONLY ABOUT ONE IN. TWENTY ARE ARE A BIT AND ONLY ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF TWO THIRDS ARE NOT GETTING THE SERVICES THEY NEED. I'VE SPENT ABOUT FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS IN THE FIELD. DOING RESEARCH -- INTERVIEWING. PRACTITIONERS NURSES PSYCHIATRISTS WHO ARE LOOKING WHO ARE WORKING IN THE MENTAL HEALTH FIELD. WE CONDUCTED RESEARCH AND SIX STATES WITH DIFFERENT SCOPES OF PRACTICE. IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE LOOKED AT FIVE COUNTIES. IN OF I'LL TELL YOU MORE ABOUT OUR FINDINGS ON THAT -- RELATED TO SCOPE OF PRACTICE SUPERVISION WAS REPORTED AS AN ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN BY MANY OF OUR INTERVIEW IS. FINDING A SUPERVISOR. CHANGING A SUPERVISOR ONE ONE OR THE OTHER LEFT THE PRACTICE. SCHEDULING MEETINGS COULD COMPETE WITH PATIENT CARE TIME. IT'S ALSO COSTLY SUPERVISION IS COSTLY TO THE ORGANIZATION WHETHER IT'S A COST IN PAIN THE PSYCHIATRISTS TO DO THE SUPERVISION -- IN EXTRA SALARY YOU'RE TAKING MONEY AWAY FROM PATIENT CARE TAKING MONEY AWAY FROM PATIENT CARE BASICALLY. IT'S CAN BE COSTLY TO INDIVIDUAL NURSE PRACTITIONERS WITH OUT OF POCKET COSTS. IN SOME STATES WE FOUND THAT THAT NURSE PRACTITIONERS ARE PAYING UP TO THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS OUT OF THEIR POCKET FOR SUPERVISION EXPENSE. YOU JUST SPEAK UP LOUDLY INTO THE MIKE PLEASE SURE THANK YOU SORRY. IS THAT BETTER SORRY OKAY -- MORE IMPORTANTLY IN THE FIELD. WE GOT A SENSE OF OF HOW THIS WORKS MORE COLLABORATIVELY. WE DIDN'T SEE AN ADVERSARIAL PRACTICE ENVIRONMENT WE DIDN'T SEE HIGHER ARKY. WE SAW EVERYBODY WORKING TOGETHER TO SHARE THE GOALS OF PATIENT CARE AND ACCESS TO CARE. AND RESPECT FOR EACH OTHER'S EXPERTISE. WE FOUND THE PRACTITIONERS APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT WITH EACH OTHER A DIFFICULT CASES CHALLENGING CASES SOMETHING THAT WASN'T IN THEIR EXPERTISE. BUT THAT WAS BETWEEN NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND PSYCHIATRISTS. CONSULTATION IS GOOD CONSULTATION IS HELPFUL PARTICULARLY FOR NEW PRACTITIONERS. MANDATED SUPERVISION IS NOT THE WAY TO APPROACH THAT CONSULTATION. SOME OF OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS REPORTED ALSO THAT IN SOME COUNTIES THEY COULDN'T RECRUIT PSYCHIATRISTS SO THEREFORE THEY COULDN'T RECRUIT IN PEACE. IF YOU CAN'T RECORD A PSYCHIATRIST YOU CAN'T RECRUIT AN EMPTY. IN THE PRACTICE AREA. LACK OF IN PEACE CAN ALSO. ADVERSELY IMPACT RURAL AREAS. AS WE TRY TO ADDRESS THE WORLD HEALTH WORK FORCE. THE SUPERVISION ISSUE COMES UP IF WE CAN FIND A PSYCHIATRIST TO SUPERVISE IN A RURAL AREA WE WON'T BE ABLE TO TRAIN THE THE END PIECE THERE IT IT REALLY ARE IS IS TO TAKE PEOPLE FROM THE RURAL AREA. AND GROW YOUR OWN THIRTY SECONDS LEFT OKAY -- SO IN SUMMARY I JUST WANTED TO SAY WE NEED PSYCHIATRISTS AND WE NEED MENTAL HEALTH NURSE PRACTITIONERS. WE NEED TO REDUCE THE BURDEN OF ADMINISTRATION AND THE AND THE COST OF SUPERVISION. AN INCREASE ACCESS TO CARE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT.

WITNESSES TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO ASSEMBLY BILL. EIGHT NINETY THE KILEY MAKE SOME ROOM. HERE AT THE TABLE [inaudible] THANK YOU. AGAIN FOR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION UP TO FIVE MINUTES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MAKING ALL RIGHT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. I WANT TO FIRST THANK THE COMMITTEE CHAIR COMMITTEE STAFF AS WELL AS THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF WILL WORK TO SEE A MADE TO DEVELOP FRAMEWORK THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FRAMEWORK WE LAID OUT IN OUR LETTER. HOWEVER MAJOR AND SUBSTANTIAL SUBSTANTIVE DETAILS ARE YET TO COME IN DISCUSSION. THIS IS THE FIRST POLICY COMMITTEE AND THE FIRST HOUSE AND WE WANTED TO ENSURE THAT THERE WAS A FRAMEWORK IN PLACE TO ALLOW FOR DISCUSSION TO CONTINUE. COMMITTEE AMENDS ACHIEVE THAT BUT BY NO MEANS IS THE BILL A FINISHED PRODUCT THERE STILL ARE SIGNIFICANT AREAS IN WHICH WE DIFFER FROM THE AUTHOR AND SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL THAT IMPACT PATIENT SAFETY. SUCH AS THE GRANDFATHERING IN OF KERR NURSE PRACTITIONERS THE COMPETENCY TEST REQUIREMENT. AND LANGUAGE THAT NEEDS TO BE INCLUDED TO ENSURE LAY INDIVIDUALS AREN'T INTERFERING WITH THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. OFTENTIMES PEOPLE THINK THAT THE CORPORATE BAR SIMPLY IN THE CUT. THINK OF THE COVER BAR SIMPLY IN THE CONTEXT OF EMPLOYMENT. IF THERE'S A WHOLE SET OF RULES TO ENSURE PRACTITIONERS AREN'T INTERFERED WITH IN TERMS OF THEIR CLINICAL JUDGMENT. AS A NOTE FOR THE COMMITTEE THERE'S NOTHING IN THE BILL THAT ENSURES THIS REMOVAL OF SUPERVISION. WILL ADDRESS ACCESS TO CARE WE PASSED A LOTS OF DATA THAT SHOWCASES THE FACT THE NURSE PRACTITIONERS DON'T MOVE TO RURAL AREAS WHEN GRANTED INDEPENDENT PRACTICE AND NOTHING IN THE BILL ENSURES THAT THEY WILL DO THAT IN CALIFORNIA. WE'RE COMFORTABLE CONTINUING THIS CONVERSATION BUT ASK THE MEMBERS RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CHANGE THEIR VOTE ON THE FLOOR OF THIS IS YET TO BE AS THIS IS YET TO BE FULLY COOKED LEGISLATION WITHOUT WE REMAIN OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED BUT LOOK FOR ITS ON GOING DISCUSSIONS. THANK YOU TERM LOW AN ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS DOCTOR YURI AND I MADE DOUBLE BOARD CERTIFIED PHYSICIAN IN PRIVATE PRACTICE AND IN THE UNIVERSITY SETTING. AFTER HEARING ABOUT THIS BILL I CANCELED MY CLINIC TODAY AND FLEW IN LAST NIGHT TO BE HERE. I AM ALSO A MEMBER OF PHYSICIANS FOR PATIENT PROTECTION A GRASSROOTS GROUP OF TEN THOUSAND PHYSICIANS ADVOCATING FOR PHYSICIAN LIKE CARE. AND TRANSPARENCY AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. I WANT TO EXPRESS MY OPPOSITION AB EIGHT NINETY AS IT STANDS. I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT I HAVE A DEEP RESPECT FOR NURSE PRACTITIONERS AS THEY ARE INTEGRAL MEMBERS OF THE HEALTHCARETEAM. THIS IS NOT A TURF WAR. MY MOTHER WAS A GRADUATE OF THE FIRST NURSE PRACTITIONER CLASS AT UC DAVIS AT A I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THEIR ROLE IN HEALTH CARE. HOWEVER I ALONG WITH MOST PHYSICIANS IN THIS STATE ARE OPPOSED INDEPENDENT PRACTICE OF MEDICINE BY ADVANCED PRACTICE NURSES WHO HAVE 3% OF THE TOTAL TRAINING OF A BOARD CERTIFIED PHYSICIAN. TO BE CLEAR NURSE PRACTITIONER TRAINING IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO PHYSICIAN TRAINING IT IS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT TRAINING BASE IN NURSING CARE INSTEAD OF MEDICAL CARE. TO BELIEVE THAT ADVANCED PRACTICE PROVIDERS ARE OR CAN BECOME EQUIVALENT TO BOARD CERTIFIED PHYSICIANS IS NOT ONLY INCORRECT IT'S DANGEROUS. IT'S ANALOGOUS TO A DENTAL HYGIENISTS PRACTICING INDEPENDENT DENTISTRY OR PARALEGALS PRACTICING LAW. I UNDERSTAND THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS TO ATTEMPT TO FILL THE VOID OF A PERCEIVED PHYSICIAN SHORTAGES SPECIAL IN RURAL AREAS. MY MOM IS A FAMILY NURSE PRACTITIONER IN A REAL HEALTH CARE CLINIC IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY FOR FORTY YEARS. AND CARED FOR THE POPULATIONS THAT ARE AT GREATEST RISK. HOWEVER RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT IN STATES WHERE AND P. INDEPENDENCE THAT INDEPENDENCE IS LEGAL. A SMALL PERCENTAGE ARE IN RULES SETTINGS AND THE RATS PRACTICE IN URBAN AND SUBURBAN SETTINGS AND MOST PRACTICE SPECIALTY CARE INSTEAD OF PRIMARY CARE OR PSYCHIATRIC PSYCHIATRY. THIS CLOSELY MIRRORS THE PRACTICE DISTRIBUTION OF PHYSICIANS AND DOESN'T REALLY ALLEVIATE. ANY SHORTAGES IN CARE. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THIS BILL FAILS TO MANDATE THAT ANY NURSE PRACTITIONERS WHO CHOOSE TO PRACTICE INDEPENDENTLY SHOULD ONLY DO SO WITHIN RURAL AREAS. I WENT IN THE FIELD THE PRIMARY CARE ONLY. WITHOUT THIS STIPULATION THE CORE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS LEFT UNADDRESSED. UNFORTUNATELY THE CURRENT TRAINING AND OVERSIGHT OF NURSE PRACTITIONERS IS NOT ADEQUATE FOR INDEPENDENT PRACTICE IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE REALITY IS THAT YOU CANNOT LEGISLATE EDUCATION. NURSE PRACTITIONERS ARE NOT EDUCATED IN THE ART OF MEDICINE. NOR DO THEY UNDERGO RIGOROUS TESTING TO VALIDATE THEIR COMPETENCY. THE SIMPLE TRUTH IS THAT WE DO NOT HAVE A PHYSICIAN SHORTAGE. WE HAVE A LEGISLATIVE BOTTLENECK. EVERY YEAR EIGHT THOUSAND MEDICAL STILL SCHOOL GRADUATE PHYSICIANS DON'T MATCH AND A RESIDENCY POSITIONS BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS MAINTAINED ITS FUNDING CAP OF MEDICARE FUNDED RESIDENCY POSITION SINCE. NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN DESPITE HAVING FOUR YEARS OF MEDICAL SCHOOL FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED MORE HOURS OF HANDS ON CLINICAL PRACTICE. THE NURSE PRACTITIONERS FIVE HUNDRED HOURS OF SHADOWING THESE ON MATCH POSITIONS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO PRACTICE INDEPENDENTLY. INSTEAD OF SPENDING LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY INCREASING NURSE PRACTITIONER TRAINING AND CREATING A NEW REGULATORY BOARD FOR THEM. PERHAPS WE SHOULD FIND MORE RESIDENCY POSITIONS AND INCENTIVIZE PHYSICIANS TO STAY WITHIN UNDERSERVED AREAS TEN SECONDS LEFT THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS TO ADDRESS THE LACK OF QUALITY HEALTHCARE AND RULE SETTING BUT THIS BILL AS IT STANDS IS NOT THE ANSWER. I BELIEVE THAT THE ANSWER WILL INVOLVE SOME PERMUTATION OF AN INCREASE IN PHYSICIAN RESIDENCY POSITIONS AND INCENTIVES FOR BOTH PHYSICIANS AND NURSE PRACTITIONERS. TO PRACTICE WITHIN RULES SETTINGS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR FLYING ALL THE WAY UP HERE TO PROVIDE YOUR TESTIMONY WHEN NOW CALL UP INDIVIDUALS WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO ASSEMBLY BILL. EIGHT NINETY PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COME TO THE MICROPHONE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY AGAIN THIS IS NOW A OPPOSITION TO ASSEMBLY BILL. EIGHT NINETY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MY NAME IS RANDALL HAGER WITH A CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION WE HAVE AN OPPOSE LESS AMENDED ON THIS BILL. PRIOR TO THE AMENDMENTS WERE STUDYING THEM -- I THINK WE WOULD LIKE TO ASSOCIATE OUR COMMENTS WITH OUR COLLEAGUE FROM THE CMA. ON THIS WE HAVE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS WE LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING THE AUTHOR AND ON THOSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN MOVE THE BILL IF YOUR LINE UP. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M HERE -- WITH CONCERNS WE DON'T HAVE ANY SUPPORT OR OPPOSE POSITION I'M DOUG CHIP PETA. WITH THE UNION OF AMERICAN PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS WE'RE KIND OF A UNIQUE ENTITY IN THAT WE REPRESENT GOVERNMENT POSITIONS BUT DONNELLY THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO SIT DOWN WITH THE AUTHOR SO I WANT -- TO AVOID GETTING INTO ANY TECHNICAL CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO THE BILL I WOULD JUST SAY THIS THAT THE BILL AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN HAS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR PUBLIC SECTOR POSITIONS. WE'VE DEALT WITH THIS BILL OVER THE YEARS SO CHAIRMAN HERNANDEZ OF BROUGHT IT FORWARD FROM THE SENATE A COUPLE TIMES BEEN THREE OR COMMITTEE.

ISSUES FACING OUR STATE AND THAT IS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND RURAL COMMUNITIES. WE TALKED BEFORE AND LIKE YOU I REPRESENT A DISTRICT THAT'S PRETTY RURAL. AND I'M TELLING YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS SINCE I'VE BEEN IN OFFICE IT. IT IS TREMENDOUSLY CHALLENGING TO GET QUALIFIED MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS TO MOVE TO RURAL COMMUNITIES AND INCREASE ACCESS TO CARE -- SO I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE WITH THE GOALS OF YOUR BILL. I HINK I'VE MET WITH ALL SIDES ON THIS ISSUE I THINK EVERYBODY MAKES REALLY. HONESTLY GREAT POINTS AND AND IS OPERATING GOOD FAITH -- I THINK THIS THIS COULD REPRESENT A POSITIVE MOVE FORWARD OUT RIGHT NOW THERE'S A FEW ISSUES WITH THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE THING THAT I'M STILL TRYING TO GET COMFORTABLE WITH -- AWAY OFF THE BILL TODAY -- AND I LOOK FOR TO SING OUT OF ALSO IN THE PROCESS BUT I THINK THERE. I'D LIKE TO BROADEN THE DISCUSSION TO AT A LATER TIME TO YOU KNOW HOW COOPER ABOUT TELEMEDICINE.

THAT GET MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS TO MOVE TO THESE UNDERSERVED AREAS AND I THINK -- SO AGAIN I JUST WANT TO SAY THANKS FOR YOUR FOCUS ON THIS THANKS FOR DILIGENT WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS.

OF ONE THINK THE DOCTOR FOR PROVIDING HER TESTIMONY MAKERS SACRIFICE ON TO FLY HERE IN REGISTERING YOUR CONCERNS -- WITH THE OP I'M WITH THE PARTICULAR BILL -- BUT I AM I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT I'M MORE CONFIDENT WITH THE AUTHORS WILLINGNESS TO WORK AND FIND A BALANCE. THAT THIS BALANCE CAN GO BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE IN PEOPLE WHO HAVE ANY KIND OF REFERENCE RESERVATIONS WILL IN FACT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL MOVING FORWARD.

AND I THEN I ALSO THINK IT'S IT'S RATHER INSULTING -- TO TO COMPAREA NURSE PRACTITIONER TO A DENTAL HYGIENIST -- I THINK WE'RE TALKING APPLES AND ORANGES AND THEN AGAIN WE KNOW THAT THIS WORKS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. WE KNOW AND NOT JUST IN RURAL AREAS BUT IN URBAN AREAS WITH A LOT OF THE HIGH DEGREE OF POVERTY A HIGH DEGREE OF NEED -- THAT THERE IS A SEVERE PHYSICIAN SHORTAGE. THIS WORKS OTHER PLACES THERE'S NO -- THERE'S NO REASON IT CAN'T WORK HERE. AND I LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS AS IT GOES THROUGH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A SUMMARY DALY FALL BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA. I DO THINK THE AUTHOR AS SOMEONE WHO.

THANK YOU MISTER CHART AND DOCTOR WHAT I THINK EVERYTHING'S BEEN BROUGHT UP THE CONCERNS OF MEMBERS ONE THING THAT HASN'T BEEN BROUGHT UP THAT I WANT. TO BOB REYES AS YOU CONTINUE YOUR WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION IS THAT WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF OTHER ENTITIES THE MIDWIVES AND ATHLETIC TRAINERS THAT I'VE WANTED. NEW BOARDS -- THIS IS A NEW BOARD AND I'M JUST FEARFUL THAT THIS MAY OPEN THE GATE. TO OTHER -- MEDICAL PROVIDERS AND HAVE THEM COME BACK IN.

HOWEVER THERE ARE URBAN AREAS THAT WE FIND THAT ARE COMPLETELY UNDERSERVED. AND LACK OF HEALTH ACCESS -- NAMELY ONE IN RICHMOND WHERE DOCTORS HOSPITAL WAS CLOSED.

I'D ALSO SHARE THE CONCERNS OF RESIDENCY AND BOTH FOR DOCTORS AS WELL AS A NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND THE AMOUNT THAT THEY HAVE NOW VERSUS WHAT I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE A BIT MORE ADEQUATE IF THEY'RE GOING TO DO INDEPENDENT WORK AS WELL SO -- LOOK FOR TO SEE IN THIS BILL IS A PROGRESSES FORWARD AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY.

SEE NOTE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME DOCTOR WHAT DO YOU WISH TO CLOSE I DO AND I WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS FOR THEIR COMMENTS TO THEIR AYE I WILL MAKE ONE COMMENT -- WITH REGARDS THE OPPOSITION AND THAT -- I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS SHORTAGE OF PHYSICIANS IS A PERCEIVED STORAGE I BELIEVE IT IS ABSOLUTELY REAL -- WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF FORTY SEVEN WE WILL HAVE BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE A SHORTAGE OF FORTY SEVEN HUNDRED BY TWENTY THIRTY WILL BE TEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS IN THIS DAY.

IMPLICATIONS TO THE WHICH THIS HAS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LET ME ALSO JUST CLARIFY AND MAKE THE STATEMENT THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT. THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IS FUNDAMENTALLY OPPOSED TO THE IDEAL. AT THE IDEA OF A AND P. INDEPENDENT PRACTICE AND YET THEY HAVE ALSO COME TO THE TABLE -- BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS A MEASURED APPROACH AS IT COMES TO THE FIRST POLICY. HEARING AS WELL -- TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE. SAFETY BUT I WANT TO JUST GET THE A KNOWLEDGE MEANT TO ASK THAT QUESTION ON THE KEY PRINCIPLES AND FRAMEWORK I SHOULD THIS BE THE BILL BE THE COMMITTEE WHICH IS THAT AGAIN OF THE REGULATORY STRUCTURE OF THE BOARD. THE PATHWAYS TO PRACTICE WHICH INCLUDES THE AMOUNT OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING CURRENTLY IN THE BILL AND THE LIMITED APPLICATION OF THE CORPORATE BAND IS THAT CORRECT DOCTOR WHAT IS CORRECT AND IT SIMPLY TO THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IS THAT SIMILE TO THE AGREEMENT OF THE PRINCIPLES. IN THE FRAMEWORK WORKING TOGETHER AS IT LEAVE THIS POLICY COMMITTEE. PERFECT -- AND SO AGAIN WITH -- THAT NOTE I MADE I KNOW IT PERHAPS MAYBE PERCEIVE THAT THIS HAS. COME ABOUT IN SUCH EASY FASHION BUT I JUST WANT TO URGE AND GIVE THIS SENSE PARTICULARLY FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS BECAUSE AS COMMITTEE MEMBERS WE RUN AROUND AND AND AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT.

AND THE REASON IS -- I'LL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS THAT WILL REPLACE THE CURRENT BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD PROHIBIT A PHYSICIAN FROM CHARGING THEIR PATIENTS MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS TO COMPLETE. A STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE MEDICAL FORM. THE NEW AMENDMENT WILL REQUIRE A PHYSICIAN TO CHARGE A REASONABLE FEE BASED ON THE ACTUAL TIME AND COST FOR FILLING OUT MEDICAL FORMS WHICH WOULD INCLUDE THE STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE APPLICATION. ZERO AB THREE SEVENTY WOULD ALSO CLARIFY THAT IT IS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE THAT THE COMPLETED MEDICAL FORMS BE MADE AVAILABLE AT THE LOWEST COST TO THE PATIENT. THE GOAL OF THIS MAJORS TO PROTECT PATIENTS FROM BEING REQUIRED TO PAY EXISTS COSTS IN ORDER TO GET A DOCTOR TO FILL OUT ONE SHEET. OF PAPER WHICH IS WHAT THE DOCTORS PORTION OF A DISABILITY FORM IS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT AN INDIVIDUAL APPLYING FOR STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE MAY ALREADY FACE SOME FORM OF WAGE LOSS DUE TO THEIR DISABILITY THAT'S ASKING DOCTORS AND PHYSICIANS.

THANK YOU MISTER TURN MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT TODAY ON A. B. FOURTEEN SEVENTEEN AN ACT RELATING TO THE ADVERTISING OF AN LICENSE CANNABIS BUSINESS. BUSINESS SAYS I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO EXPAND THE SCOPE OF THE BILL TO APPLY. TO ALL ADVERTISING PLATFORMS AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF FOR HELPING US WITH THESE AMENDMENTS AND HELPING US STRENGTHENED THE BILL I ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO COOPER THE BILL AS AMENDED. I'M AS YOU KNOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA STARTED ISSUING STATE LICENSES AT THE BEGINNING OF LAST YEAR FOR CANNABIS BUSINESSES TO OPERATE IN THE STATE. DESPITE SOME SUCCESS DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF LEGAL SALES THE BLACK MARKET HAS CONTINUED TO FLOURISH DRIVING DOWN THE EAGLE SALES. ACCORDING TO A RECENT REPORT BY THE CANNABIS ADVISORY COMMITTEE LACK OF ENFORCEMENT IS CREATING A THRIVING ENVIRONMENT FOR THE UNREGULATED UNDERGROUND MARKET. IN ADDITION TO DWINDLING TAX REVENUES THE UNDERGROUND MARKET PRESENTS SERIOUS PUBLIC SAFETY AND PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS TO OUR COMMUNITIES. NEWS ARTICLES FROM AROUND THE STATE HAVE DOCUMENTED VIOLENCE AND CRIME AT THESE ONLINE SAYS UNLICENSED DISPENSARIES. IN ADDITION TO THE KIND OF ITS PRODUCTS SOLD AT THESE LOCATIONS THEY DO NOT MEET ESTABLISH QUALITY STANDARDS AND EVADE STATE TESTING. COMBATING THE UNDERGROUND MARKET IS A KEY POLICY GOAL FOR THE LEGISLATIVE FOR THIS LEGISLATIVE HERE. THIS BILL WOULD TARGET THE BLACK MARKET BY CRACKING DOWN ON A SPECIFIC PROBLEM THE ADVERTISING OF THE ILLEGAL CANNABIS BUSINESS. CERTAIN PLATFORMS HAVE BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED WHEN IT COMES TO THE PRACTICE IN ADVERTISING LEGAL OPERATIONS FOR PROFIT. AB FOURTEEN SEVENTEEN WILL CLASSIFIED THE ACT OF PUBLISHING THESE ILLEGAL ADVERTISEMENTS AS AN UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICE AND CREATE CIVIL PENALTIES FOR AND FOR ENTITIES WOULD DECIDE TO ADVERTISE THE LEGAL OPERATIONS IN EXCHANGE FOR PROFIT. AS THE LEGISLATURE WE CANNOT SAY THAT WE ARE TAKING CANNABIS BLACK MARKET SERIOUSLY IF WE ALLOW THE REGULAR PROMOTION AND ADVERTISEMENT OF ILLEGAL BUSINESSES. TO EXIST WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE WE KNOW THAT THESE ADVERTISEMENTS DRUG BUSINESS TOWARDS THE LEGAL OPERATE OPERATORS AND MUST FIND A WAY TO RESTRICT THIS PRACTICE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY NINE NOW WILL NOW TURN -- TO THE MICHAEL RICHARDS SPONSORS AND SUPPORTERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND UP TO THREE MINUTES IN TOTAL YEAH MARIN PINERA -- WITH CALIFORNIA ADVOCACY HERE WITH MY CLIENT IN A CAN HAS BEEN ASSOCIATION WHO WOULD DO THAT TESTIMONY. HELLO MY NAME IS JARED KILEY LOW ON THE PRESIDENT THE UNITED CAN WITH BUSINESS ASSOCIATION I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB. FOURTEEN SEVENTEEN THIS BILL IS NOT TO RESTRICT ADVERTISING IN TECHNOLOGY OF LEGAL BUSINESSES THIS BILL IS AN EFFORT TO HOLD A SMALL NUMBER OF TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR DELIBERATE IGNORANCE. OF THE CLIENTS THAT FACILITATE FAIL FOR AND PROFIT OFF THE ILLEGAL SALE. CANNABIS LAWS OUR STATE REGULATED SO THE ADVERTISING SHOULD BE AS WELL -- SOME OTHER CITIES AND STATES LIKE THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES HELD A POPULAR CANNABIS WEBSITE WE'D MAPS ACCOUNTABLE TO LAWS THAT RESTRICTED ADVERTISING FOR UNLICENSED BUSINESSES. AND THEY COMPLIED OTHER STATES HAVE HELD THE SAME DEMANDS OF THIS OF THIS ADVERTISING PLATFORM AND THEY HAVE COMPLIED AS WELL SO WHY HERE IN CALIFORNIA DO WE DO WE TELL A STATE AGENCY THAT THEY WILL NOT COMPLY WITH STATE LAW. IT'S MONEY. THEY TAKE TOO MUCH MONEY IN CALIFORNIA FOR ILLEGAL CANNABIS OPERATIONS TO STOP THE UNDERMINING OF OUR NEWLY ENACTED REGULATIONS. THERE ARE THREE CURRENT -- TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS THAT CURRENTLY ADVERTISE CAMPUS BUSINESSES YELP AS ONE OF THEM IT IS FREE OR UP TO THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH TO BE HAVE A LISTING AS A STATIC MENU HAS HANDS OFF APPROACH. IS USER GENERATED RED FLAGS IN CASE THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT WE'D MAPS ON THE OTHER HAND CAN TAKE UP TO THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH IN CASH. THEY HAVE A LIVE MENU THEY HAVE A SHOPPING CART TO FACILITATE THE DELIVERY THE PRODUCT TO A TO RESIDENTS NO USER GENERATED RED FLAG FOR INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT AND THE PET LEGAL VERSUS ILLEGAL BUSINESSES AGAINST EACH OTHER. BY FACILITATING A BIDDING WAR FOR TOP SPOT FOR ADVERTISING. I'M WE HAVE RESTRICTED ADVERTISING FERTILITY FACILITATING FAILED OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITY FROM BACK PAGE DOT COM AND FROM CRAIG'S LIST THE OWNERS A BACK PAGE SERVE JAIL TIME FOR THEIR AIDING AND ABETTING OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. SO THIS IS NOT A PRECEDENT SETTING REGULATIONS WE ALLOW BUSINESSES TO PROFIT OFF IF IF WE ALLOW BUSINESSES TO PROFIT OFF THE SKIRTING OF STATE LAW. THEN IT EMBOLDENED OTHERS TO ENTER THIS BASE AND ACCOUNTABILITY NEEDS TO SLOW OR STOP THE PROLIFERATION. LIKE ALL THEIR BUSINESS IS ADAPTING THE CHANGING REGULATIONS IT IS JUST PART OF THE JOB I MATH IN THE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY KNOWINGLY AND WILLINGLY ADVERTISING FREE LEGAL BUSINESSES. BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE UNDER THIS PROVISION BECAUSE WE HAVE TO CHANGE THEIR BUSINESS MODEL WITH THE FIFTH IN THE FIFTH LETTER FROM THE BUREAU OF CAMPUS CONTROL THEY DID NOT COMPLY THAT IS WHY WE NEED AB. FOURTEEN SEVENTEEN THIS IS THE KEEP OUR ENFORCEMENT OF OUR STATE CAMPUS REGULATIONS SILO INSIDE OUR STATE BORDERS. THEY SHOULD NOT BE A FEDERAL ISSUE OTHER STATES HAVE FOUND A WAY FOR ACCOUNTABILITY SO CAN CALIFORNIA WITH THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIRMAN OF HELLO THANK YOU ARE YOU IN YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF AND THE OF COURSE THE AUTHOR OF THE BUILT.

WITH ONE GOAL IN MIND TO RAISE A CENTER LIVING FOR THE WORKERS TO CREATE UP TO HELP CREATE AND REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS IN CALIFORNIA. MUCH LIKE WE'VE DONE WITH CLOSER WORKERS. THE BIGGEST THREAT TO THE WORK WE'RE DOING IN THIS SPACE IS THE LIST OF MARKET PLACE THIS BILL. WE THANK.

FOURTEEN TO SEVENTEEN FIGURE KILEY MAKE SOME ROOM HERE AT THE DESK AGAIN THIS IS TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO ASSEMBLY BUILT. FOURTEEN SEVENTEEN IF YOU WOULD. KILEY NAME AND AFFILIATION AND UP TO THREE MINUTES. TOTAL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE JIM HE WORKED WITH A CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION WE APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO GET A LETTER IN ON TIME. WHEN THE BILL WAS SET WE HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE TO EXPRESS THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE? ABOUT THAT PROVISION OF THE BILL WHICH CREATES. OF STRICT LIABILITY FOR NEWSPAPERS BROADCASTERS AND OTHERS -- THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF AN UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICE REFERENCE. AND IT. THE WITH THE WAY THAT IT WOULD WORK IS -- IF IT IS JUST FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR TO REQUIRE A NEWSPAPER -- ADVERTISER I WAS COULD MEAN. ADD TAKER OUGHT -- TO YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IS IN EACH AND EVERY AD THAT THEY TAKE -- MOST ADVERTISEMENT COMING COPY READY -- BUT THIS DOESN'T EVEN REQUIRE THAT THE NEWSPAPER NO THAT THE AD WAS -- LEGALLY INFIRM -- THERE'S NO STANDARD APPLIED IF THE AD RUNS WITH OUT THE APPLICANTS LICENSE NOW OR THE LICENSEES LICENSE NUMBER IN THE AD. THEN THE NEWSPAPERS AUTOMATICALLY LIABLE -- THAT'S JUST FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR -- WHAT THIS ATTEMPTS TO DO AND AND AND BUT LET ME BE CLEAR WE WE DON'T OPPOSE THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THIS BILL IS -- BEING CONSIDERED -- TRYING. TO CUT BACK OR CURB -- ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES BUT ARE TO DEPUTISE NEWSPAPERS -- CREATES -- FROM A PUBLIC POLICY STANDPOINT. ARE A MUCH WORSE HARM -- THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT SEEKS LAW ENFORCEMENT BETTER LAW ENFORCEMENT -- FOR IN -- FOR FOR ENSURING THAT THE LAW IS FOLLOWED BUT IN DEPUTISING NEWSPAPERS THAT IS NOT THE ANSWER AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF MY NAME'S MARK POWERS AND I REPRESENT THE RADIO AND TELEVISION STATIONS THAT SERVE YOUR DISTRICTS. A WE POSE THIS BILL BECAUSE WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE MEDIA SHOULD NOT BE A REGULATORY ARM OF GOVERNMENT. THAT WOULD BE A HUGE CHANGE IN CURRENT ADVERTISING ALONG THE RADIO AND TV STATIONS IN YOUR DISTRICT ARE CONVEYORS OF INFORMATION. NOT ENFORCERS OF THE LAW THE REGULATORY BURDENS YOU IMPOSE SHOULD ALWAYS FALL ON THE CREATORS OF THE INFORMATION. THAT YOU MIGHT THINK THAT ENSURING AN ADVERTISEMENT HAS A LICENSE NUMBERS A MINIMAL EFFORT. BUT IT HAS TO BE AN ACCURATE LICENSE NUMBER WHICH MEANS STATIONS COULD NEVER RELY ON THE ADVERTISER TO PROVIDE THEM WITH INFORMATION. ALWAYS HAVE TO DOUBLE CHECK WITH WHATEVER REGULAR RATE REGULATORY AUTHORITY THERE WAS. NOW AFTER YOU PASS THIS BILL IMAGINE THE SAME LOGIC THAT YOU'RE GONNA APPLY TO REAL ESTATE AND CONTRACTORS LICENSES NUMBERS DISCLOSURES AN AUTO ADDS DISCLOSURES AND POLITICAL ADS. FOOD BRED **** AND PRODUCT CLAIMS AND SO ON THE REASON WHY MEDIA IS NOT PLACED IN THIS POSITION. THEY WOULD HAVE TO KNOW THE SPECIFIC LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL LEGAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ADVERTISING EVERY POSSIBLE INDUSTRY AND ITEM FOR SALE. YOUR STATIONS INFORM ADVERTISERS WHEN THEY SEE AN ERROR. AND THEY REFUSE ADS WHEN THOSE ERRORS ARE NOT CORRECTED. BUT KNOWING WHAT THOSE COUNTLESS POSSIBLE REGULATORY ISSUES MIGHT BE IS NOT THEIR JOB AND CERTAINLY NOT THE RIVER LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY SO WE ASK FOR NO VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COME WITH A MICROPHONE NAME AND AFFILIATION IF YOU WISH TO DO SO MISTER CHAIRMAN -- MEMBERS -- GEORGE MILLER ON BEHALF OF WE MAPS AND SIMILAR -- TO MYSTERY OR IT'S STATEMENT A MOMENT AGO ABOUT NOT HAVING A LOT OF OPPOSITION AND I SINCERELY APOLOGIZE TO THE AUTHOR AND THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- FOR ALSO NOT HAVING ONE AND WE WOULD JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE AUTHOR IS TAKEN AND THE SPONSORS OF TAKEN. WE BELIEVE THAT THE BILL'S FAR MORE EQUITABLE IN ITS APPLICATION WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS MOMENT FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS ASSEMBLYMEMBER GRAYSON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AND IT AT FIRST WHEN I WAS -- LOOKING AT THE BILL IT SEEMS LIKE THE THAT IT WAS ADDRESSING PLATFORMS WITH THE MAIN PURPOSE WAS GIVING INFORMATION ABOUT THE SALE OF CANNABIS. BUT THERE ARE -- BUT IF IF I UNDERSTOOD IT CORRECTLY AND I CAN BE CORRECTED BECAUSE I JUST WALKED IN HERE -- THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER SITES ON THE INTERNET THAT PUT OUT INFORMATION ON ON MULTITUDE OF TOPICS BUT ALSO INCLUDE -- CANNABIS AS WELL SO -- WOULD IT BE. AND IT MAY BE THE AMENDMENTS ALREADY ACCOMPLISH THIS WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO ADDRESS THE EXPANSION -- TO BE ABLE TO CAPTURE. ANY PLATFORM THAT IS PROMOTING THE SALE OF CANNABIS INSTEAD OF LIMITING IT TO JUST CERTAIN PLATFORMS AND IS IT SO THAT THE AMENDMENTS ADDRESS THAT. YES MISTER GRAYSON THE CURRENT A COMMITTEE MEN MEANS THAT THE AUTHOR HAS AGREED ACCEPTED -- HAVE IT TO BE MORE ENCOMPASSING OF THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT WELL THANK YOU AND I APOLOGIZE FOR ANY REPETITIOUS -- TESTIMONY THERE AND I THINK YOU TO THE OFFICE FOR BRING THE SUPPORT OF THE SUPPORTING THE BILL. NUMBER WOULD YOU WISH TO ADD ON AND ANY ADDITIONAL AYE LOOKING YES THAT THAT THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR A THROUGH THE WEEKEND -- TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS ALL OF THE ISSUES AND AGAIN I THINK THAT THE OTHER COMMITTEE STAFF AND THAT CHAIR -- FOR BEING -- WILLING TO HELP ME -- CLARIFY THIS AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET IT TO THE NEXT STEP. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF SOMEONE WOMAN I'M. SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS -- I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT ON ALL OF US TO TRY AND ENFORCE COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING LAWS AND AND REDUCE. THE ADVERTISING OF NON LICENSE SERVICES. I HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT THE BILL AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THAT THAT YOU WERE AWARE OF UP IN BOTH MY CONCERN AND SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF AND REYES BY THE OPPOSITION. SO. I I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH REQUIRING A SOPHISTICATED PLATFORM LIKE WE'D MAPS TO COMPLY WITH CALIFORNIA LAW REGARDING CANNABIS I THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT THEY WOULD BE EXPERTS ON WHAT THAT LAW SAYS BUT OTHER ADVERTISING PLATFORMS I'M NOT SURE THAT IT'S REASONABLE AND I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE. I THAT IS YOU KNOW I COME FROM A VERY SMALL TOWN. I ONE OF THE SMALLEST IN MY DISTRICTS AND AND WE HAVE ONE PAPER IN TOWN THE BIG BEAR GRIZZLY -- IT'S GOT A CIRCULATION OF JUST A COUPLE OF THOUSAND COPIES IT ONLY COMES OUT ONCE A WEEK. SO -- FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT LET'S SAY THE SOMEONE ADVERTISES CANNABIS FOR SALE IN THE GRIZZLY I DON'T THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT THEY WOULD BE. EXPERTS ON CALIFORNIA CANNABIS LAW AND MY READING OF THE BILL LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT IF THEY WERE TO ALL MET. THE LICENSE NUMBER ALTHOUGH THE ADVERTISER WOULD IF THEY WERE TO MAKE A LIGHT THEIR LICENSE NUMBER. AND THE GRIZZLY WERE NOT TO CATCH IT -- AND THEY WERE TO CORRECT THAT IF THAT AIR WAS BROUGHT TO THEIR ATTENTION THEY WERE CORRECT AT THE VERY NEXT ISSUE THAT SEVEN DAYS A TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY THEY BE LIABLE. FOR ALMOST TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN -- AND CIVIL PENALTIES AND I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S THAT'S REASONABLE. YEAH I ALSO. TO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE RIGHT A PRIVATE ACTION IN THE BILL. BECAUSE I'M CONCERNED THAT -- RATHER THAN GOING AFTER THE SOPHISTICATED ACTORS LIKE WE PERHAPS THAT WILL HAVE OPEN THE DOOR TO LAW FIRMS GOING AFTER THE UNSOPHISTICATED ACTORS LIKE THE BIG BEAR GRIZZLY THE THOUSANDS OF OTHER NEWSPAPERS. Là SIMILAR THEM ACROSS THE STATE SO THAT'S MY CONCERN AND I REALLY WISH THAT -- THAT THAT THE BILL HAD BEEN NARROWED A LITTLE BIT TO RECOGNIZE SOME OF THE TRADE OFFS THERE BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO BE SUPPORTED BUT UNFORTUNATELY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BE. TODAY BECAUSE OF THOSE ISSUES. THANK YOU. MISTER WOULD KNOW TO YES I I AGREE AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE THE COMMITTEE TRYING TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES THIS BILL IS STILL GOING TO DO JUDICIARY AND I'M. THE COMMITTEE CHAIR HAS -- AGREED TO WORK WITH ME ON TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT BY IT I I THINK THE BIGGER PICTURE I AGREE WITH YOU BUT THE BIGGER PICTURE IS THAT -- WE ARE ADVERTISING ON REGULATED -- DISTRIBUTORS AND THIS IS DANGEROUS NOT JUST. FOR SELF BUT SOME OF THESE THESE -- PRODUCTS ARE NOT TESTED SO IT'S DANGEROUS TO THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AND SO I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE CHAIR AND WOULD LOVE TO SIT DOWN AND TALK TO YOU ABOUT. HOW WE CAN ADDRESS THIS IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE BUT AT THIS TIME THIS IS THE ONLY I THINK THE ONLY AVENUE TO BEGIN THE CONVERSATION WE HAD A SIMILAR BILL LAST YEAR? AND BUT THAT IS NOT BEING COMPLIED WITH BECAUSE THEY HAVE -- I THINK THE THE VENDOR WITH SAYING THAT IT'S WE DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO REGULATE THE ONLINE PLATFORM SENSE OF THEY'RE NOT COMPLYING WITH BAD BECAUSE OF THE ONLINE. ONLINE REGULATION BY THE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ADDRESS THIS FOR ME MY CONCERN IS FIRST AND FOREMOST THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY SOME OF THESE PRODUCTS ARE NOT BEING TESTED IN ITS. ITS POISON AND SOUL SOUL WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO RESTRICT THESE VENDORS AND I AGREE WITH -- THE SMALL ADVERTISERS BUT YOU KNOW JUST IN MY HEAD I'M THINKING IF YOU WERE GOING TO ACCEPT ADVERTISEMENTS THERE SHOULD BE -- YOU DON'T JUST SEND IN AN ADVERTISEMENT AND SENT MONEY YOU HAVE TO DO A CONTRACT. OR AT LEAST -- YOU HAVE TO SUPPLY THE INFORMATION OF WHO THE VENDOR IS AND THE AND THE PAYMENT. IT'S JUST LIKE YOU ASK FOR A CREDIT CARD NUMBER YOU CAN ASK FOR A VENDOR. LICENSE NUMBER AND IF YOU'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT THEN. THE THE BIG BEAR GRIZZLY CAN CAN CHECK BACK THAT IS AN ONLINE PLATFORM BAD -- THE STATE PROVIDES WHERE THEY CAN CHECK THE LICENSES OF THOSE VENDORS SOLD FOR ME. AGAIN I'M NOT IN THAT ARENA BUT IT SEEMS SIMPLE ENOUGH THAT IF YOU'RE PROVIDING A CONTRACT TO THESEPEOPLE WHEN THEY ADVERTISE THAT THEY THEY NEED TO INCLUDE THEIR THEIR CANNABIS LICENSOR LEVIN WE COMPLETELY AGREE ABOUT THAT BUT THE PROBLEM IS YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT THAT IS A STATE. REQUIREMENTS. AND ADVERTISERS COME IN ALL DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES FOR ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF SERVICES AND TO EXPECT A A SMALL NEWSPAPER TO KNOW ABOUT ALL OF THE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS IN ALL OF THE DIFFERENT AREAS OF STATE LAW. I THINK IS NOT REASONABLE ONE SO WELL. TRUE I THINK WE SHARE THE SAME GOAL YES SO I I'M I'M CONVINCED THAT MAYBE THERE'S A MIDDLE GROUND THERE RIGHT SO I'LL SEE IT AGAIN AND JUDICIARY ON I'D WELCOME THE CONVERSATION AND AND I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO TO FIND A WAY -- THAT WERE REASONABLE WITH RESPECT TO THOSE KINDS OF REQUIREMENTS THAT'S THAT STILL ACCOMPLISHES THE AIM OF THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME -- AND JUST FOR CLARIFICATION ON THE A DIALOGUE THAT JUST OCCURRED THE COMMITTEE MEN'S ARE SILENT ON THE PROVISIONS MISTER OBERNOLTE THAT YOU THAT JUST ADDRESS WITH THE AUTHOR.

AGAIN THIS IS FILE ITEM NUMBER NINE ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTEEN THIRTY BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY. AND AGAIN FOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT UP TO THREE MINUTES AND WHEN THIS IS AN OPPOSITION UP TO THREE MINUTES ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY. GOOD. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE BEFORE YOU TODAY ON THIS BILL -- THIS BILL STANDS OUT FOR ME BECAUSE IT'S FOR REFLECTS AN AREA OF CONCERN AND POLICY THAT I WORKED ON FOR MORE THAN FIFTEEN YEARS. I'VE COURSE WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN THE FOUNDING OF A CITY. DESIGNED TO PROMOTE LOCAL CONTROL THE ABILITY OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO SET. GOALS FOR THE CHARACTER OF LIFE IN OUR COMMUNITY -- AND THAT'S THE THIS BILL FIFTY THIRD RELATES. TO WHAT I BELIEVE IS THE POLICY THAT WAS SET IN MOTION BY THIS COMMITTEE IN. TWENTY FIFTEEN WITH THE VOTE ON A. B. TWO SIX SIX WHEN I WAS THE AUTHOR OF IT WE EVENTUALLY SHIFTED AUTHORSHIP. I GAVE THAT BILL ABOUT CALLING MR BONTA. BUT WHEN THE BILL WAS FIRST HEARD IN THIS COMMITTEE IN. TWENTY FIFTEEN THE LOCAL CONTROL MEDICAL MARIJUANA BILL PASSED BY A THIRTEEN TO ONE VOTE -- ANY OTHER BILL ONLY GARNERED NINE VOTES. SO REALLY THE WHOLE CHEMISTRY OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA BACK IN. TWENTY FIFTEEN THAT COURSE WAS SET BY THE ASSEMBLY BMP COMMITTEE. WHEN YOU CAME DOWN VERY SHARPLY ON BEHALF OF LOCAL CONTROL? ON THE SUBJECT MATTER THAN MORE GENERALLY OF MARIJUANA IS SOMETHING I'VE WORKED ON FOR QUITE AWHILE. BACK IN TWENTY TEN YOU MAY RECALL THERE WAS A BALLOT PROPOSITION DEAL WITH MEDICAL DEAL WITH RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA. AND I ACTUALLY DID A OVERVIEW THAT BALLOT MEASURES IT WORKED ITS WAY ON TO CALIFORNIA CHOICES DOT ORG OR STATEWIDE WEBSITES. FOCUSED ON POLICY CONVERSATION. ALSO IN TWENTY TEN I SUPPORTED. PUT ON THE BALLOT AS MAYOR A LOCAL ORDINANCE RETRO A TAX ON MARIJUANA CULTIVATION. WHICH PASSED IT BY MORE THAN 55% SO. AS I APPROACH THIS ISSUE AND THIS BILL. THE CENTERPIECE OF AB TWO SIX SIX THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA BILL. THAT WAS SET IN MOTION BY THIS COMMITTEES VOTE IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY FIFTEEN WAS A CENTERPIECE OF WHAT WENT TO THE GOVERNOR I ACTUALLY WROTE THE GOVERNOR THAT YEAR. SPEAKING OF AB TWO SIX SIX THAT ENSURES A STATE AND LOCAL LICENSE MUST BE IN PLACE FOR MEDICAL MARIJUANA BUSINESS TO OPERATE. THAT'S CREDIBLE STATEWIDE STANDARDS AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THIS WAS AN ALMOST TWENTY YEAR IMPASSE ON MEDICAL MARIJUANA YEAR TO YEAR THE LECTURES AND FAILED TO ADOPT RULES. BOARD THAT LOCAL CONTROL PROTECTION AT THE HEART OF THE TWENTY FIFTEEN DEAL THAT WENT TO THE GOVERNOR HE SIGNED INTO LAW. THIS TO ME IS WHY THE PROPONENTS OF PROP [inaudible] SIXTY FOUR IN. SIXTEEN SAID AS THEY DID SAY. THAT IT WOULD PROTECT THE LOCAL AUTHORITY. THAT IS WHAT THE BALLOT ARGUMENTS SAID. THAT IS WHAT THE SO THE ARGUMENTS MADE ON BEHALF OF BY THE PROPONENTS SAID OF PROTECT ALL CONTROL. THE LA OWES IMPARTIAL BALLOT. STATEMENTS SAID THE SAME THING AND I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT. THIS LEGISLATURE. BY SAFEGUARDED LOCAL CONTROL SO THE LOCALS DO NOT ACTUALLY FEEL THREATENED. BY STATE LICENSURE. BY LOCAL NOT HAVING A GRIPE ABOUT STATE REGULATION AS I COULD MOST ARE YOU SURE THEY GRIPE ABOUT THE A. B. C.'S. APPROVAL OF NEW LIQUOR STORES AND BARS IN CITIES AND COUNTIES WITH VERY LITTLE. SAY. THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY DIDN'T GO DOWN THAT TRAIL OF TAKEN AWAY LOW CONTROLLERS SAFEGUARDED. AND EVEN IN THE COURSE OF THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA CONVERSATION. MY ASSIST WAS ALWAYS. I HAD TWO GUIDING PRINCIPLES A GUIDED THAT WHOLE CONVERSATION AND THIS BILL TIES INTO IT. SAFEGUARD LOCAL CONTROL. AND IF YOU SAFEGUARD LOCAL CONTROL WHAT YOU'LL GET IS SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY BE MORE COMFORTABLE EARLIER. BUT THEY WILL SHOW HOW THESE BUSINESSES ACTUALLY DO WORK. SO THE PARADE OF HORRIBLE'S THAT LOCAL OFFICIALS HAVE THEIR MINDS ABOUT HOW BAD THESE BUSINESS ARE. CAN GET SORTED OUT THEY JUST REALIZE OKAY MY APPREHENSIONS ARE NOT WELL FOUNDED IN FACT. AND THIS WILL ALLOW OTHER JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE RESISTANT AT FIRST TO KIND OF FALL INTO LINE [inaudible] AND THIS BILL. WHICH WILL SAFEGUARD THAT ABILITY MAINTAIN A BAND IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT. ALSO INCORPORATES A BUDGET ASK FOR GRANTS. TO SUPPORT LOCALS AS A START OPEN UP THIS MARKET TO GET SOME HELP ON ENFORCEMENT. SO THIS BILL CARRIES OUT THE VISION THAT I WAS AT THE HEART OF BY ADVOCACY AND AND PROP. TWO SIX SIX RESPECT LOCAL CONTROL. BUT AT THE SAME TIME TRY TO WOO THE LOCALS TO GET PASTOR PRAYED FOR BULLS DEAL WITH THE REALITY. AND THIS TO ME IS A MUCH MORE SUSTAINABLE LONG TERM STRATEGY FOR HOW WE AS LAWMAKERS. CAN FIND A WAY TO ADVANCE PUBLIC POLICY WITHOUT. CREATING CONFLICTS BELOW THE COMPLEX WORK THEMSELVES OUT BY ADROIT LEADERSHIP -- I WANT TO SAY THAT THE DECISION OF THIS COMMITTEE AT THAT. AT THAT FIRST TERRY TO PASS. THE BILL OVERWHELMINGLY THE HEAD LOCAL CROLLES HEART. PLAYED OUT IN OUR HOUSE DRAMATICALLY BECAUSE COME JUNE. WHEN THE SENATE WAS MOVING A BILL DEALING WITH MEDICAL MARIJUANA? THE AUTHOR IN THE END THAT HOUSE MUSTARD A PRETTY GOOD VOTE OF THE SENATE FOR ON THE SAME DAY ARE VOTE WAS TAKEN. THEY GOT A TWO TO ONE VOTE TWENTY SIX TO THIRTEEN AND FOR THE SENATE. GOOD JOB BY SENATOR MCGUIRE. BUT ON THAT DAY IN OUR HOUSE. THE ASSEMBLY PASSED. THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA BILL OF LOCAL CONTROLS HEART. SIXTY TWO TO EIGHT SO WE ACTUALLY SIDE WITH LOCAL CONTROL. BROUGHT PEOPLE THE MIDDLE. AND ACTUALLY CREATED THE MOMENTUM THAT EXPLAINS WHY THE PROPONENTS OF PROP SIXTY FOUR SUPPORTED IT. RODE INTO SIXTY FOR USE IN THEIR ARGUMENTS WHY THE LA -- SOUGHT THEIR AND AND IT'S WHY I NOW BRING THIS BILL ST I'M STILL A PROPONENT OF PRESERVING LOCAL CONTROL. BUT I STILL HAVE IN MIND THIS LONG TERM STRATEGY AS YOU RESPECT LOCAL CONTROL. YOU CAN. ENCOURAGE JURISDICTIONS YOU KNOW THEY WERE SORT OF JAMMED UP WITH THE WAY PROP SIXTY FOUR WAS PASSED. THEY HAD TO HAVE A POLICY IN PLACE BY JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND WHEN YOU HAVE A SHORT TIME FRAME LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO ADOPT SOMETHING. YOU CAN TRY TO GET A NEW US POLICY WHICH INVARIABLY TAKES A LONG TIME A LOT OF CONVERSATION. WE JUST GO THE BAN. SO I ACTUALLY FEEL THAT THE NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE BANDS I DON'T ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT REPRESENTS LONG TERM ANIMUS. TOWARDS THIS POLICY CHANGE THAT THE VOTERS OF BRACED. I SEE THAT AS EXPEDIENT REACTION. TO FILL IN THE CLOCK LOOMING. AND JUST TAKE IT A STEP TO KIND OF INSURE THAT LOCAL CONTROL WAS RESPECTED. AND SO TO ME THIS BILL REPRESENTS A LONG ONGOING EFFORT ON MY OWN PART TO KIND OF WORK IN THIS BASED RESPECT LOCAL CONTROL. BUT THE SAME TIME TO ADVANCE POLICY AND TO AVOID TRAIN WRECKS. AND JUST SUPPORT DISABILITY FOR ALL. EVERY ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES OF ALL FIVE HUNDRED CITIES TO KIND OF TAKE A MORE [inaudible] STOP HYPERVENTILATING. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE PRINTER HORRIBLE. FOCUS ON THE FACTS AND MAKE SOME SPECIFIC DECISIONS. AND ON THE ISSUE OF OF THEM ACCESS TO MEDICAL MARIJUANA I DO WANT TO SAY [inaudible] THAT. I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT EVEN MAJOR SEARCH WHICH BANDS CULTIVATION A COMMERCIAL SENSE CANNOT BAN. CULTIVATE FOR PRIVATE USE WHICH IS THE RIGHT TO FIFTEEN AFFORDED. AND I WOULD SAY THERE'S ACTUALLY NO MEMBER IN THE ORIGINAL GANG OF FIVE WORK ON THIS. THAT WAS MORE PERSISTENT INSANE DO NOT LOSE TRACK OF ACCESS TO MEDICAL MARIJUANA. INDEED IN THE BILL THAT WE SENT THE GOVERNOR MEDICAL MARIJUANA. THE BILL PROVIDED FOR A TASK FORCE TO HELP ADVICE TO BUREAU. REGARDED ISSUES A PATIENT ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY WHICH WAS A PROVISION I INSISTED BE THERE. AND EVEN PROP SIXTY FOUR DOES NOT STATE OVER RULED THAT. IT DOES SAY THEY TRIED TO STREAMLINE THINGS THAT SORT OF THING BUT SOUL. I ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT. ACCESS TO MEDICAL MARIJUANA IS IMPORTANT. UC SAN DIEGO HAS THE MEDICAL. CANNABIS RESEARCH INSTITUTE OUR WHICH ESTABLISHES THAT THERE'S GREAT MANY FUNCTIONALITY CAN RISE AND USE OF CANNABINOIDS AND CANNABIS. TO DEAL WITH EPILEPSY AND MANY OTHER AFFLICTIONS. IN A WAY THAT'S ACTUALLY SUPERIOR TO MORE OPIOID BASED THING SO I THINK WE NEED TO BE ENCOURAGED THAT. SO THAT IS MY BACKSTORY ON THE BILL -- I FEEL REFLECTS. AS I SAY. AN INTEREST IN QUALITY OF LIFE LOCALLY THAT IS WHY I AM ACTUALLY MEMBER TODAY BECAUSE IT PROFIT RUN FORMA CITY AND THEN BECOME MAYOR. THIS INTEREST A MARIJUANA GOING BACK TO TWENTY TEN ONE NINETEEN WAS ON ABOUT. AND I PUT MY OWN LOCAL ORDINANCE -- AND YET I'M STILL WORK OF THIS IDEA OF PROTECT THE LOCAL CURRENT CONTROL THE ONE HAND HOW DO YOU WILL -- LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO FEEL THEY CAN PUT THEIR TOLL ON THE WATER. GET PAST THEIR FEARS. AND BROADNESS REACH I THINK THAT'S A LONG SUSTAINABLE STRATEGY. AND I KNOW I HAVE MY COLLEAGUES HERE IN SUPPORT SO I WILL JUST. INVITE THEIR COMMON I THANK YOU ALL FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THREE MINUTES PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TROUT HARVEY IN BEHALF OF THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES WE SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. THIS BILL A SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES -- AN ENTIRELY NEW POLICY -- THAT ALLOWS FOR CANNABIS TO BE TO BE DELIVERED STATEWIDE -- REGARDLESS OF ANY CITY OR COUNTY PROHIBITION OR LIMITING ORDINANCE -- ON SUCH ACTIVITY -- NOW AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED AT AS PASSED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE A U. M. A. -- AND POWER THE LEGISLATURE ACTION TOO MANY INITIATIVE -- BY EITHER SIMPLE MAJORITY OR TWO THIRDS VOTE I DEPENDING ON THE SPECIFIC NATURE OF THOSE AMENDMENTS -- BUT ONLY IF THE MEASURE FURTHERS THE PURPOSE -- AND INTENT OF THE ACT YOU KNOW OTHERWISE THE VOTERS THEMSELVES MUST WEIGH IN -- AS WE'VE YOU IT'S HARDLY ARGUABLE THAT THAT THE RULE AND AND QUESTION THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SIX TWO DIRECTOR -- FIVE YOU KNOW BILLS THE FOR THAT PURPOSE AND AND AND INTENT OF OF THE ADULT USE MARIJUANA ACT AND SO -- YOU KNOW MOREOVER UNLIKE. VIRTUALLY ALL OTHER NEWLY ESTABLISHED CANNABIS POLICY -- THIS POLICY AT ISSUE WAS CREATED IN A REGULATORY VACUUM BY THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL DEVOID OF ANY THOUGHTFUL LEGISLATIVE. CONVERSATION OR DEBATE -- CONSEQUENTLY BY HAPHAZARDLY REMOVING A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REASONABLE REGULATORY AUTHORITY ON CANNABIS DELIVERIES -- IT WILL BE C. IS IMPOSE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH -- TO ALL TO CANVASS REGULATION THAT REALLY DOESN'T REFLECT CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE POPULATION AND WIDE SPECTRUM OF THE POINTS ON THE TOPIC. NOW FROM THE LEAGUE'S HE POINT THERE A FEW CONCERNS THAT UNDERSCORE THE NEED FOR THIS LEGISLATION -- FIRST THE STATE WIDE DELIVERY REGULATION SERVES AND OURS THE NATION AS A BROKEN PROMISE TO THOSE WHO PASSED PROP SIXTY FORMED UNDER THE BELIEF THAT LOCAL AUTHORITY WOULD BE PRESERVED -- THE STATE OF THE A YOU I'M A GUARANTEE THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS YOU KNOW PURSUANT TO THE CREATION AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF A DUAL LICENSING STRUCTURE WOULD BE ABLE TO ALLOW. REGULATE OR PROHIBIT ANY AND ALL COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE. COMMUNITIES. AND WAS REALLY ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS THE MEASURE RECEIVED THE SUPPORT THAT IT DID FROM CITIES AND COUNTIES -- THE REGULATION AT ISSUE EFFECTIVELY STRIP THAT LOCAL DECISION MAY AUTHORITY AWAY -- FROM LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND REALLY SERVES THE CLEAR OVERREACH THE BCC AND ULTIMATELY MADE FOR AN UNJUSTIFIED EXPANSION OF EXISTING LAW THIS. SURE ONE MINUTE LEFT. SO I MEAN REALLY IN OUR ESTIMATION CURRENT RULE IS CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT -- WHERE THE ILLICIT MARKET CAN GROW AND THRIVE WITHOUT FEAR OF CRIMINAL CONSEQUENCE -- WHICH IS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT PROP SIXTY FOUR YOU KNOW START TO START -- TO TO ACHIEVE. AND SO YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY AB FIFTEEN THIRTY WOULD RECTIFY THE IMPACT OF OF ANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR NOT JUST CITIES WITH BANDS BUT THOSE WITH MANY ORDINANCES AND EVEN THOSE WHO AUTHORIZED DELIVERY WERE TRYING TO PROTECT THOSE LOCAL OPERATORS FROM. HAVING TO COMPETE NOT JUST AGAINST ILLICIT MARKET PLACE BUT THE AGAINST OTHERWISE LEGITIMATE OPERATORS FROM OUT OF JURISDICTION -- AND SO WHAT THE LEAGUE IS NEITHER PRO NOR ANTI CANNABIS BUT THIS IS ABOUT RESTORING THE ABILITY OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS BUT TO REASON THE REGULATE AS THEY SEE FIT FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES. IN SECONDS MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS PAUL SMITH WITH THE ROLE COUNTIES ASSOCIATION WE WERE ALSO AT THE PARTY -- IN TERMS OF THE CRAFTING THE M. ZERO SAID THING ON ONE OF JUST REAL QUICKLY BUILD UPON -- SOMETHING THAT -- MISTER COOLEY SAID WHEN THIS COMMITTEE PASSED HIS LEGISLATION. THE THE PRESUMPTION WAS THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAD TO ACT TO PROHIBIT MOBILE DELIVERIES PROP SIXTY FOUR COMES ALONG AND CHANGES THAT PRESUMPTION BUT IT'S STILL PRESERVES LOCAL CONTROL WHAT WHAT MR CALL THESE REALLY ASKING FOR HERE IS NOT TO GO BACK TO THE M. SIERRA SAY BUT JUST REAFFIRM. WHAT BOB SIXTY FOUR SAYS WE WOULD URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU ANY? JUST A QUICK COMMENT CARE MARTIN ST ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES WE'LL JUST SAY THAT WE ARE PARTNERS WITH THE STATE IN THIS REGULATORY PROGRAM I'M SERIOUS SAME PROP SIXTY FOUR WERE FOUNDED SORT OF ON A PROMISE OF THAT PARTNERSHIP OF LOCAL CONTROL. WE ARE TRYING TO INCENTIVIZE SPOKES THAT ARE INTERESTED IN REGULATING TO COME TO THE TABLE AND CRAFT REALLY REASONABLE -- APPROACHES TO AT INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO GET OUT OF THE ILLICIT MARKET INTO THE REGULATED MARKET PLACE WE FEEL THIS BILL RESPECTS THE INTENT OF SIXTY FOUR AND CERSEI ND MATT KERR SO I AYE RESPECTING LOCAL CONTROL -- YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL.

GOOD AFTERNOON OR MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AMY JENKINS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. I'D ACTUALLY LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY FOR HAS LONG STANDING COMMITMENT TO DEVELOPING A FRAMEWORK FOR THE REGULATION AND LICENSURE OF COMMERCIAL CANNABIS. MR COOLEY WAS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL -- FIVE WHO BELIEVE THAT A REGULATED SYSTEM WAS ESSENTIAL TO ACHIEVING IMPORTANT STATE PUBLIC POLICY OBJECTIVES THAT SUPPORT A THRIVING LEGAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY WHILE ENHANCING PUBLIC AND CONSUMER SAFETY. THIS IS PRECISELY WHY CCA'S OBJECTIVE WHEN THE ORGANIZATION WAS FOUNDED -- TO TO YOU KNOW SUPPORT A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK WHICH IS WHY WE SADLY AND MUST REGRETTABLY OPPOSE AB FIFTEEN THIRTY TODAY. AS HE NOTED A KEY CORNERSTONE OF THIS FRAMEWORK IS LOCAL CONTROL FOR THE RECORD CCA HAS NEVER OPPOSED LOCAL CONTROL. IN FACT AS THE MEDICINAL FRAMEWORK WAS BEING DEVELOPED OVER FOUR YEARS AGO CCA WORKED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ASSOCIATIONS INCLUDING THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES TO MAKE THIS FRAMEWORK A REALITY. UNFORTUNATELY NO ONE ANTICIPATED HOW FEW CITIES AND COUNTIES WHICH ULTIMATELY CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE. AFTER SIXTEEN MONTHS -- SINCE THEY DON'T USE TOOK AFFECT WE ARE SEEING CALIFORNIA'S COMPLIANT CANNABIS INDUSTRY CONTRACT FOR THE FIRST TIME. JUST 20% OF OUR STATE CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE AUTHORIZING SOME FORM OF COMMERCIAL CANNABIS ACTIVITY AND LEAD EVEN LESS ARE AUTHORIZING COMMERCIAL CANNABIS RETAIL. ACCORDING TO STATISTICS OBTAINED BY THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL JUST YESTERDAY JUST UNDER A THOUSAND RETAIL LICENSES HAVE BEEN ISSUED STATEWIDE. AND SANTA CLARA THEIR EIGHT WE TELL LICENSES -- IN ONE CITY OF FIFTEEN CITIES IN KERN THERE ARE THREE REAL RETAIL LICENSES IN ONE OF ELEVEN CITIES AND LA APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE AND TWENTY OF EIGHTY EIGHT CITIES. IN ORANGE COUNTY THIRTY RETAILERS IN ONE CITY OF APPROXIMATELY. THIRTY FOUR IN SAN BERNADINO FOURTEEN RETAILERS AND THREE OF TWENTY FOUR CITIES WITH THE RATIO OF AND RETAIL LICENSE PER HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED RESIDENTS. A NO VOTE ON AB FIFTEEN THIRTY WILL NOT IMPROVE THESE A VISIBLE STATISTICS HOWEVER OPPOSING THIS BILL TODAY WILL UPHOLD LOCAL CONTROL. CITIES AND COUNTIES WILL STILL BE ABLE TO BAN BROKEN WATER CANNABIS FACILITIES IN THEIR COMMUNITY. AT THE SAME TIME AND NO VOTE WILL ENSURE THAT CANNABIS CONSUMERS AND PATIENTS CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS TO QUALITY PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BEEN TRACKED TESTED PROPERLY LABELED AND CONTAINED IN CHILD RESISTANT PACKAGING. IT WILL FURTHER ENSURE THAT CANNABIS OPERATORS HAVE VERIFIED THAT THE CONSUMER IS OVER. TWENTY ONE FOR THESE REASONS CCA STRONGLY OPPOSES AB FIFTEEN THIRTY AND URGES HERE NO VOTE TODAY TWENTY SECOND [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE MY NAME IS AN CANKER I'M A PARENT OF OR FOUR SONS ONE OF WHOM HAS EPILEPSY.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES TO WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME AGAIN WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. AT THIS TIME TO ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTEEN THIRTY SING THAT THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTEEN THIRTY ARE THE NOW QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME WILL BEGIN BY. GOING OFF WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AS JUST -- NOT THAT I THINK I NEED ANNOUNCES BUT I HAVE -- ABSOLUTE THEM IMMENSE RESPECT FOR THE AUTHOR. AND FOR THE INTENT THAT HE HAS ON THE BILL HOWEVER I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT TODAY -- THIS BILL. FOR THE FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT -- DELIVERY IS A WAY OF ACCESS NGUYEN -- THE BANNING OF OF THE PRODUCT AS FAR AS GROWTH I I UNDERSTAND THERE'S A A PROVISION FOR MEDICAL GROWTH TO BE ABLE -- TO FOR FOR FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO GROW FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES HOWEVER AS WAS STATED IN PRIOR TESTIMONY -- RENTERS MAY NOT BE IN THAT POSITION TO BE ABLE -- I AND TO TO PERSONALIZE THIS A LITTLE BIT THERE'S NO DOUBT -- THAT MY MOTHER WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY HAD SHE JUST HAD ACCESS. AND BECAUSE OF THAT -- OPIATES PRETTY MUCH HARDEN HER BODY UP FROM HEAD TO TOE. SO WITH THAT ACCESS FOR ME IS THE THE BIGGEST BIGGEST ISSUE EVEN THOUGH I DO SUPPORT LOCAL CONTROL I FELT LIKE THE DELIVERY WAS A WAS THE MEDIUM THAT THAT ACCESS. NGUYEN A LOCAL JURISDICTION WOULD PAN -- OTHER PARTS OF IT WHETHER IT BE STOREFRONTS MANUFACTURES OR WHATEVER SO -- I APPRECIATE THE INTENT AND WANT TO HELP TRY TO PRESERVE LOCAL CONTROL IN EVERY WAY I CAN -- BUT AT THE SAME TIME NOT HINDER -- ACCESS AND I UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU WILL I DO UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS THE HOPE OF THE AUTHOR RELEASED I DO MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME -- THAT LOCAL AGENCIES WOULD THEN WITH LOCAL CONTROL BE ABLE TO OPEN UP THEIR THEIR ABILITY TO ACCOMMODATE ACCESS. BUT I DON'T FORESEE THAT HAPPENING IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE AS YOU TESTIFIED IT'S A NEW WANTS THAT TAKES TIME. SO I WANT TO KEEP ACCESS OPEN. IT WAS IT WAS AT A FORM OF OF A QUESTION MISTER GRAYSON OR DO YOU KNOW IT WAS. OKAY WAS ALONG JUST FINE AND AGAIN IT I JUST WANT TO GET CLARIFICATION AND THE AUTHOR CAN ADDRESS WHICHEVER COMES THAT YOU WISH LIGHTNING IS CLOSE YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK -- I THINK -- THE POINT THAT I BROUGHT UP ABOUT -- THE INTENT OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IS IT IS IT YOUR INTENT THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WOULD TAKE YOUR BILL AND USE IT FOR LOCAL CONTROL TO ALLOW. ACCESS -- TO MEDICAL MARIJUANA. I WANT TO JUMP ON THAT ACTUALLY ABSOLUTELY THAT WOULD BE MY INTENT. I THINK THE PROBLEM YOU HAVE IS THE AS WE PASSED A BALLOT PROPOSITION. THIS SAYS THE LEGISLATURE CANNOT CHANGE EXCEPT TO FURTHER ITS INTENT. THE INTENT EXPRESSED IN THE BALLOT ARGUMENTS. IS LOCAL CONTROL. INDEED THE LA -- ANALYSIS SAYS. A PERSON CAN GET DELIVERY FROM THEIR LOCAL BUSINESS FROM THEIR BUSINESS. SO IT ACTUALLY THE BALLOT ARGUMENT DOES NOT ALLOW FOR JULY DELIVERY IT CUT THE PLACE I HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BRICKS AND MORTAR STORE. AND GET DELIVERY. SO BILLS THE PROPOSED A DIFFERENT DELIVERY MODEL. DON'T ALIGN WITH THE LANGUAGE OF THE PROPOSITION. DON'T LINE WITH THE REPRESENTATION THE PUBLIC IN THE BALLOT ARGUMENTS. DON'T ALIGN WITH A JASON KENNEY WAS TELLING PEOPLE MONTHS BEFORE THE VOTE. SO THIS FACT WHICH I HAD NO PRIOR NOTICE OF THAT THE SERIES OF NOW SUIT ON THIS ISSUE. WHATEVER YOU THINK THE THE VIEWS THE MERITS OF DELIVERY. THERE NEEDS YOU NEED SOMEBODY. TO TRY TO FIND A WAY TO RECONCILE THESE VIEWS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF PROP SIXTY FOUR AND THE POLICY IN THIS AREA. AND I WOULD ACTUALLY SUBMITTED AB [inaudible] FIFTEEN THIRTY BECAUSE IT IS CLEARLY SUPPORTED LOCAL CONTROL. BUT JUST AS CLEARLY SUPPORTING MOVEMENT BY LOCALITIES TO GET INTO THIS BUSINESS OF ALLOWING IT. AND THEN POLICING A PROGRAM. IS THE PATH. THAT I THINK YOU START WORKING ON THINGS I WILL SAY. I COME OUT OF CITIES BUT YEAH. I ACTUALLY HAVE A STRONG CONNECTION. THE LEAGUE OF CITIES BECAUSE I BECAME A COUNCIL MEMBER NO. THREE ALL. FOR I'VE GOT ACT WITH THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AND BIO NINE I WAS FIRST VICE PRESIDENT STATEWIDE. I JUST MOVED TO THE RANKS OF THE LEAGUE. TOP LEADER I DIDN'T END UP TAKING THAT JOB BECAUSE I STEPPED AWAY FOR THAT BECAUSE OF THE NEW JOB FROM MY PERSONAL POINT. THAT DIDN'T FEELS COMPATIBLE. BUT SO I ACTUALLY FEEL I HAVE STRONG RELATIONS LEAGUE OF CITIES. I ALSO APPRECIATED PAUL SMITH BEING HERE. BECAUSE I REMEMBER SITTING IN JIM WOODS OFFICE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW THIS WILL ALL IN FULL. AND WAS IN THAT MEETING THAT I EXPRESSED THE VIEW WHICH I I BELIEVE IS THE PATH OUT OF THIS DILEMMA. WHICH IT CAN IT'S KIND OF A FUNNY ANALOGY. DECISIONAL MISTER SMITH IS GONNA BE LIKE WORLD WAR TWO IN THE PACIFIC. WE'RE GONNA MAKE HEADWAY. ON CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS. AND OF OTHERS AREN'T THERE ON A ONE THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE AS WE MAKE HEADWAY THE PRADO HORRIBLE SCHOOL. DIMINISH IN PEOPLE'S MINDS WILL PICK UP ON THE JURISDICTION. I FEEL THAT IS THE WAY TO RECONCILE. THE LONG RUNNING POLICY THE STATE'S SUPPORTING LOCAL CONTROL THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROP. SIXTY FOUR WHAT THE BALLOT ARGUMENTS AFFIRMED WHAT THE LA OR FIRM. TO AVOID LITIGATION ALI WORK ON THAT THIS YEAR. BUT I I THAT THE PROBLEM I THINK YOU HAVE IS THAT YOU CANNOT PASS A BILL THAT GOES CONTRARY TO THE INTENT. AND THE RECORDS PRETTY DARN CLEAR. AND TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST I'VE AYE AYE PROBLEM INCLINED TO KIND OF RIGHT OR NOT BAD AND PLACE IT SOMEWHERE. ESPECIALLY MY VIEW OF ALL OF THIS IF. IF I'M NOT AFFORDED THE OPPORTUNITY TO THE CONVERSATION THE CONTEXT OF AB [inaudible] FIFTEEN THIRTY BUT I SORT OF FEEL WERE AT A MOMENT LIKE WE WERE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WHERE THIS COMMITTEE. BY A FIRM IN A GENERALIZED PATH. AT THE FIRST POLICY HEARING IN A TO HOUSE PROCESS AT LEAST THE GOVERNOR'S DESK. CONSORTIUM POINT OUT A DIRECTION FOR SOME FURTHER WORK WHICH I WOULD CERTAINLY UNDERTAKE. I'M NOT LATE TO THE CONVERSATION. I'VE BEEN IT'S IN THIS TOPIC FOR A LONG LONG TIME. AND TRY TO BE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR EGGMAN. THANK YOU BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION -- I I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY I DON'T THINK YOU CAN TAKE SOMETHING AWAY FROM PEOPLE AFTER THEY YOU OF ALREADY GRANTED THE ACCESS -- I THINK WE HEARD FROM A LOT OF FOLKS OUT THERE AND WE ALL HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH THE OPIOID CRISIS -- THE SAFE AND LEGAL AT A CANNABIS PROVIDES PEOPLE A DIFFERENT OPTION -- AS AS A VETERAN AND I WAS ALSO SOMEBODY WHO COMES FROM LOCAL. CITY GOVERNMENT -- I APPRECIATE THAT WHEN WE PASS IT WAS ABOUT BRICKS AND MORTAR AGAIN THIS IS ABOUT DELIVERY -- SO I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY BUT I APPRECIATE THE THE THE HISTORY YOU PERCENT PROP. SIXTY FOUR TALK ABOUT YOUR LOCAL STORE AND GET IT DELIVERED FROM IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YET YOU KNOW I I'M NEW TO THAT BEING P. COMMITTEE AND IS MY FIRST TIME IN YOUR SEARCH TURNED THE BUDGET COMMITTEE THE SAME TIME. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THIS ISSUE. AND THE AND THE FOUR OTHERS IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND I I WORKED WITH YOU LOCAL GOVERNMENT HERE AT SAKS CITY WE WERE WE WERE THE ROBUST CITY. THAT STEPPED UP AND LICENSE SO MANY THESE FACILITIES AND THAT'S ONE ONE OF MY CONCERNS I HAVE FOUR ISSUES I CAN'T VOTE FOR THIS BILL I WAS GONNA LET ME OUT FOR ISSUES. ONE IS THAT IS ACCESS. SACRAMENTO HAS STEPPED UP. IN SAN FRANCISCO HAS. AND BUT ALL AROUND US ARE THESE DESERT'S. A PEOPLE WHO CAN'T GET ACCESS AND SO FRANKLY IT'S GREAT FOR SACRAMENTO BECAUSE OUR READ OUR TAX REVENUE FROM OUR SALES. OUR THROUGH THE CHARTS. THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO IS LITERALLY KILLING IT AS FAR AS BRINGING IN REVENUE. FROM MARIJUANA FROM THE MEDICINAL AND NOW FOR FROM FROM LEGAL USE. BUT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DRIVING. TEN TWENTY THIRTY FORTY FIFTY SIXTY HUNDRED MILES TO GO FROM THEIR RESIDENCES TO SACRAMENTO. IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM FAIR. AND SOME OF THEM DON'T HAVE THE ACCESS FOR TRANSPORTATION SO I JUST DON'T THINK. THAT MAKES SENSE -- THE TWO ISSUES I THINK ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO ME ARE FRANKLY ARE THE THAT THE HOW DO YOU BALANCE LOCAL CONTROL VERSES WILL THE VOTERS. SO I GET WE HAVE LOCAL CONTROL BUT WE ALSO HAVE. A BALLOT MEASURE ON A MAJOR CONVERSATION WITH ELECTION OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEY HAD SOME UNDERSTANDING AS FAR AS WHAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND SO. YOU CAN HAVE A COMMUNITY WHERE IT A CITY WHERE THE VOTERS SAID YES WE WE WANT TO HAVE THIS LEGALIZING ONE HAVE ACCESS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT COULD GO. THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. AND THEN THE THE LAST THING IS IS BY HAVING MORE JURISDICTIONS SHUT IT DOWN. THAT JUST MEANS FEWER DOLLARS -- FOR THANK YOU TAXES COMING INTO CALIFORNIA. FEW OPPORTUNE A REGULATE THIS MARKET AND FURTHER PERPETUATES THE LEGAL MARKET SO I'M NOT SURE HOW THIS REALLY HELPS THESE ISSUES WERE TRYING TO ADDRESS AND CAL THE PROBLEM IS KEVIN THAT. PURSUANT TO THE BALLOT PROPOSITION. LOCAL IT ALLOWS LOW COVERS TO BAN ON MEDICAL MARIJUANA BUSINESSES. SO SO THE ISSUE IS. THIS POWER TO BAN IS WITHIN THE EXPRESS. UNDERSTAND THE VOTERS. SO WHAT YOU REALLY NEED IS A STRATEGY TO INDUCE COMPANIES GET OFF A BIT. WHICH IS THIS BILL BY A FIRM AND THEY HAVE LOCAL CONTROL BUT GIVE THEM AN INCENTIVE. TO MOVE OUT OF THAT POSITION. THE PROBLEM IS THE VOTERS. AUTHORIZED THESE BANDS IT'S NOT CONTRARY. IT'S A LINE WITH. AND SO YOU HAVE SORT OF A YOUR YOUR YOU HAVE A LITTLE CONUNDRUM. HOW DO YOU BACK UP? WHEN THE VOTERS AUTHORIZED BANDS? AND THEN THE BAND BECAME THE EXPEDIENT WAY TO GET A LOCAL POLICY OF PLACE TO RESERVE LOCAL CONTROL. YOU NEED A PATH TO ENGAGE IN A CONVERSATION. TO JUST HAVE PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT BANDS ARE NOT. THE PRODUCTIVE LONG TERM ROUTE. WE'VE INVESTED A RESEARCH AT UC SAN DIEGO. THE MEDICAL CANNABIS RESEARCH INSTITUTE WHICH DOCUMENTS ITS UTILITY FOR EPILEPSY. AND OTHER PURPOSES WE HAVE A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE OUT THERE. AND WE HAVE [inaudible] THOSE JURISDICTIONS WHICH OUR DOCUMENT THAT YOU CAN THESE ARE COMPATIBLE THEY DO NOT DESTROY COMMITTEE QUALITY OF LIFE. THERE'S REASONABLE PROCEDURES IN PLACE THE LOCAL. JOHN D'ARMES THE POLICE CAN OPERATE COMPATIBLE IN CHECK ON ENFORCEMENT ALL OF THIS IS. IT'S KINDA WORKING HIS WAY OUT ITS THIS EXAMPLE OF YOU GET YOUR BE CHAD JURISDICTIONS. AND THEN YOU. EDUCATE OTHER JURISDICTIONS ON EASE UP. AND THIS MY APPROACH REFLEXIS LONG TERM STRATEGY SUPPORT LOCAL CONTROL. BUT INDUCE LONG TERM MOVED. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FISCALLY SHALL WE ACCEPT THAT AS YOUR CLOSE MISTER COURTS YES YES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND SEEING THAT THAT WELL AS YOUR CLOTHES AND NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME. A MYSTICAL IN THE AND FOR MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. YOU WILL SEE A NUMBER OF BILLS BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE ON WHITE SPECTRUMS WITHIN THE ISSUE OF CANNABIS. WE HAVE THE BILL PRESENTED BEFORE US AND WE ALSO HAVE A BILL THAT WILL SEE AT OUR LAST HEARING WITH RESPECT -- TO OF FORCING CITIES TO APPROVE OF DISPENSARIES WHERE IS THIS BILL WOULD PROHIBIT DELIVERY TO CITY SO WIDE SPECTRUM OF YOURS ISSUES THAT WE WILL BE TAKING A LOOK AT IN ADDITION. TO A BILL PROPOSAL TO LOWER THE TAX. TAXATION OF CANNABIS THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE WITH RESPECT TO THE CANNABIS WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN NOW OF THE ONLY A YEAR AND FOUR MONTHS OR SO INTO LEGALIZATION. IS THIS WEIRD MARRIED OF VARIOUS REGULATORY BODIES WHETHER IT BE THE LEGISLATURE THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL FOOD AND AGRICULTURE AND PUBLIC HEALTH. HOW DO WE HAVE A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO WHAT WE WANT TO DO WITH RESPECT TO THE DIRECTION OF THE REGULATED MARKET? AND WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE TO STAMP OUT THAT OF THE BLACK MARKET. WE SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE AUTHOR HERE BEFORE US HAS HAD AN EXTENSIVE HISTORY WITH RESPECT TO YOUR PERSONAL WORK IN THE CANNABIS -- YOUR LEGACY WITH RESPECT TO LOCAL CONTROL AS YOU'VE ARTICULATED TO US YOUR ENGAGEMENT AND LEADERSHIP IN THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CITIES. AS WE KNOW YOU ARE EQUALLY DEDICATED TO THAT OF LOCAL CONTROL. AT THE SAME TIME WE ALSO KNOW THAT THIS ISSUE BEFORE US IS. ONE ASPECT OF CANNABIS ON LOCAL CONTROL -- THE CHALLENGE THAT EXISTS AS BEEN ALREADY BEEN ARTICULATED BY MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE -- AND THE ISSUE OF THE DISRUPTION. TO THAT OF WHERE WE ARE HEADED IS OF PARTICULAR CONSIDERATION. HAVING SAID THAT -- I DID INDICATE TO YOU MISTER COLLEY THAT GIVEN YOUR EXTENSIVE LEGACY IN HISTORY OF WORK ON THIS ENDEAVOR IT DOES MERIT -- SUPPORT -- FROM IT TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION -- SO I AM GOING TO VOTE I TODAY BUT AS SHOULD THIS BILL MAKE IT OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE IN ITS CURRENT FORM -- I WILL BE VOTING NO GIVEN THE CURRENT CONTEXT OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED BUT YOU HAVE MADE A COMMITMENT TO IDENTIFYING THE KEY COMPONENTS THAT WE STILL NEED TO ADDRESS AGAIN. IS THIS IS THE FIRST POLICY HEARING OF THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE AND WITH THAT THAT'S WHY I AM GOING TO BE VOTING IN SUPPORT OF THIS -- BUT HAVING SAID THAT ALSO HAVE THE SIGNIFICANT RESERVATIONS -- THAT WE'VE OUTLINED. HAVING SAID THAT AND I WOULD JUST AFFIRM THAT THAT IS MY REPRESENTATION. YES SO THAT'S ON THE RECORD YES AND AGAIN. MY VOTE IS TO ARTICULATE THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE CONVERSATION BUT AGAIN THE HESITATION ON THE MOVING PIECES THAT WE'VE ALREADY HAD -- BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE SO HAVING SAID THAT IS THERE A MOTION ON THIS BILL.
