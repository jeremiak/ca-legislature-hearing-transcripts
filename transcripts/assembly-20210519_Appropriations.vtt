THE COMMISSION TO SELL ISOLATED

WILL GENERATE ADDITIONAL

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:51.300
REVENUES. THE PROBLEM UNDER

01:02:51.367 --> 01:02:52.235
EXISTING LAW IS THAT THE

COMMISSION IS CONSTRAINED BY

01:02:54.137 --> 01:02:56.239
THE EXISTING 5% CAP FOR THE USE

01:02:56.305 --> 01:02:58.241
OF FUNDS TO PAY ANCILLARY COSTS

01:02:58.307 --> 01:02:58.808
ASSOCIATED WITH LAND PERSON

01:02:58.875 --> 01:03:01.043
PURCHASES. AND THE EXISTING CAP

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:01.978
UNDERMINES THE COMMISSION'S

01:03:02.044 --> 01:03:03.646
COMPETITIVENESS IN THE MARKET

01:03:03.713 --> 01:03:05.515
BECAUSE IT MUST RELY ON SELLERS

01:03:05.581 --> 01:03:07.984
TO VOLUNTEER MOMENTARILY. TO

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:09.785
PAY THE COSTS THAT EXCEED THE

MAY BE WILLING TO PAY ALL

01:03:12.855 --> 01:03:14.690
COSTS. IN ADDITION IT'S NOT

01:03:14.757 --> 01:03:15.825
CLEAR WHAT THIRD PARTY COSTS

01:03:15.892 --> 01:03:17.360
ARE FOR SPECIFIC SEAL AND THE

01:03:17.426 --> 01:03:19.195

01:03:20.196 --> 01:03:21.998
TIMELY FASHION BECAUSE THEY DO

01:03:22.064 --> 01:03:23.065
NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO

01:03:23.132 --> 01:03:25.201

ACQUISITION COSTS. AND REMOVES

01:03:28.838 --> 01:03:31.841
THE 5% CAP ON THESE EXPENSES.

01:03:31.908 --> 01:03:33.109
THE BILL ALSO PROVIDES THAT THE

01:03:33.176 --> 01:03:34.644
COMMISSION MORE FLEXIBILITY

01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:35.912
