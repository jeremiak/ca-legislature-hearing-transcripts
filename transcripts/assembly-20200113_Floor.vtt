01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:29.898
CALIFORNIA. HE WAS SO POWERFUL

01:14:29.965 --> 01:14:31.233
THAT THE ONLY WAY THEY COULD

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:32.434
GET HIM OUT OF OFFICE WAS TO

01:14:32.501 --> 01:14:34.570
PASS A LAW TO LIMIT TERMS.

01:14:34.636 --> 01:14:36.305
BECAUSE OTHERWISE HE WOULD

01:14:36.371 --> 01:14:37.673
STILL BE HERE AS SPEAKER OF

01:14:37.739 --> 01:14:40.475
THIS ASSEMBLY. HE WAS JUST THAT

01:14:40.542 --> 01:14:41.443
POWERFUL OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHEN

01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:43.212
YOU THOUGHT MET WILLIE BROWN HE

01:14:43.278 --> 01:14:45.180
ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT THE FUTURE.

01:14:45.247 --> 01:14:46.381
NOT WHAT WHAT'S BUT WHAT COULD

01:14:46.448 --> 01:14:48.750
BE. AND PEOPLE IN THIS HOUSE%

01:14:48.817 --> 01:14:51.253
ACTUALLY WERE SECURE IN KNOWING

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:52.554
THAT WHEN THINGS HAPPEN WILLIE

01:14:52.621 --> 01:14:55.490
WOULD HANDLE IT. AND HE COULD

01:14:55.557 --> 01:14:56.058
UP AND DOWN THE STATE HAMMER

01:14:56.124 --> 01:14:58.594
THE ISSUE IS THAT WHAT BEFORE

01:14:58.660 --> 01:14:59.328
SAYS. AS THE LEGISLATURE. WHEN

01:14:59.394 --> 01:15:00.596
I WAS RUNNING FOR OFFICE IT WAS

01:15:00.662 --> 01:15:02.097
INTERESTING THAT EVERY TIME I

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:03.832
TALK TO SOMEBODY. ABOUT WHAT

01:15:03.899 --> 01:15:05.500
WAS HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:15:05.567 --> 01:15:07.269
HOW WE WERE IN CRISIS AND THEY

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:07.903
WOULD ALWAYS SAY BUT IT WILL IT

01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:10.239
WAS THERE. IT WOULDN'T BE THAT

01:15:10.305 --> 01:15:12.474
WAY. HE WOULD HAVE HANDLED IT

01:15:12.541 --> 01:15:13.842
HE WOULD HAVE DONE THIS A DONE

01:15:13.909 --> 01:15:15.410
THAT AND SO THAT WAS A HIGH

01:15:15.477 --> 01:15:16.778
LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE IN HIS

01:15:16.845 --> 01:15:18.714
LEADERSHIP NOT ONLY. IN TERMS

01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:20.249
OF DEMOCRATS BUT ALSO IN TERMS

01:15:20.315 --> 01:15:22.017
OF REPUBLICANS. HE WAS A BI

01:15:22.084 --> 01:15:23.785
PARTISAN LEADER IN EVERY SENSE

01:15:23.852 --> 01:15:25.554
OF THE WORD. A MAN WHO WAS A

01:15:25.621 --> 01:15:28.056
MASTER AT POLITICS AND STILL IS

01:15:28.123 --> 01:15:29.958

01:15:35.063 --> 01:15:37.032
BASICALLY TRYING TO CHANGE AND

01:15:37.099 --> 01:15:38.967
INFLUENCE LEGISLATION. AND

01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:40.903
PEOPLE IN THIS HOUSE. WHILE

HE'S SITTING IN SAN FRANCISCO.

01:15:42.771 --> 01:15:44.740

01:15:47.943 --> 01:15:49.511
MAN WHO STARTED FROM BASICALLY

WHEN HE BECAME THE SPEAKER.

01:16:07.896 --> 01:16:09.531
SHOCKED CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF

01:16:09.598 --> 01:16:11.433
HOW HE BECAME SPEAKER WHILE
