OKAY WE ARE A COUPLE OF- ITEMS TO NOTICE ITEM NUMBER TEN AB FIFTEEN EIGHTY WHICH IS THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE BILL IS BEING MOVED TO THE PROPOSED CONSENT AGENDA. AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE. A SLIGHT CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF BILL PRESENTATIONS WE'RE GONNA TAKE AB THREE SEVENTY ONE. BY MISTER JONES SAWYER WHICH IS OUR ITEM NUMBER FOUR FIRST. BECAUSE WE ARE ACCOMMODATING A WITNESS. WHO WE HAD HOPED WOULD BE HERE. BUT I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE WITH US ON THE PHONE SO LET US MOVE TO OUR TO OUR ITEM NUMBER FOUR AB THREE SEVENTY ONE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I. AM THINKING OF BOTH MY WITNESSES ARE VISUALLY CHALLENGING BY OTHER WITNESSES HERE RIGHT NOW SO I. I THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR MAKING ACCOMMODATION FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ADHD CHALLENGES. I PRESENT AB THREE SEVEN ONE THIS BILL EXTENDS LIABILITY PROTECTION TO PEDESTRIANS IF THEY ARE INJURED BY AN ELECTRIC SCOOTER OR BIKE COLLECTIVELY E. DEVICES. AB THREE SEVENTY ONE ALSO REQUIRES THE ADDITION OF BRAILLE AND TACTILE SIGNAGE TO THESE DEVICES SO NON VISUAL PEDESTRIANS HAVE TO CONTACT INFORMATION TO FILE ANY TO REPORT. IF THEY EXPERIENCED AN ACCIDENT SAYS IS TRIPPING OVER AN ABANDONED P. DEVICE ON THE SIDEWALK. WHEN THIS BILL SPONSOR THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF THE BLIND. FIRST CONTACTED ME I NEED TO REACH OUT TO MY BROTHER DR FRED JONES WHO IS ALSO NON VISUAL. I RECALL TIME WHEN I HELPED MY BROTHER WALK INTO A BATHROOM AND HE HEARD ME TURN ON THE LIGHT AND HE SAID WHY DID YOU DO THAT I CAN'T SEE ANYWAY. IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT THAT I REALIZED THAT I NEEDED TO TALK TO SOMEONE WHO IS VISUALLY CHALLENGE TO REALLY UNDERSTAND. WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE. NOT DID WAS LIKE TO HAVE THE CHALICE GENDER STAND ISSUES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT VISUAL YOU CAN I HAVE YOUR EYES WIDE OPEN. BECAUSE OF THE COUNTLESS EXPERIENCE MY BROTHER HIS FACE AND STILL CONTINUES TO FACE. I WANT TO ENSURE EQUITY AND ACCESSIBILITY FOR NON VISUAL PEDESTRIANS. OUT ARE THE HEART OF THIS BILL. FIRST I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE I HAVE TAKEN AMENDMENTS IN PRIVACY COMMITTEE. TO INDEMNIFY COMPANIES FROM BEING HELD LIABLE IF AN ACCIDENT RESULTED FROM USER NEGLIGENCE SUCH AS A USER DRIVING WHILE INTOXICATED. THESE AMENDMENTS ENSURE THAT PROPER PARTY CAN BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR NEGLIGENCE WITHOUT TAKING AWAY PEDESTRIANS AND ACCIDENT VICTIMS LIABILITY COVERAGE. FOR INJURIES RESULTING FROM NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. SECOND I'VE TAKEN AMENDMENTS TO DELETE ALL REFERENCES TO TRACKING. THE CURRENT ISSUE WE ARE FACING IS THAT EXISTING LIABILITY COVERAGE INVOLVING E. DEVICES ONLY EXTENDS TO USERS INJURED AS A RESULT OF OPERATING E. DEVICES. IF IT DOES NOT COVERED PEDESTRIANS AS IT DOES NOT COVER PEDESTRIANS ACCIDENT VISTA. THE EXISTING INSURANCE COVERAGE SHOULD SEND SIMILARLY BE EXTENDED TO PEDESTRIANS INJURED BY EACH DEVICES AT THE BURDEN OF RESPONSIBILITY SHOULD NOT FALL ON THE ACCIDENT VICTIMS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE PEDESTRIANS WERE NON VISUAL THAT THEY RELY ON CLEAR WALKWAYS FREE OF HINDRANCE ALSO THE ABSENCE OF BRAILLE AND TACTILE SIGNAGE PREVENTS NOT VISUAL INDIVIDUAL FROM ASSESSING THE KHI DEVICE COMPANIES. CONTACT INFORMATION AFTER AN INJURY THE ADDITION OF DESIGNERS WILL GUARANTEE NON VISUAL ACCIDENT VICTIMS CAN PROPERLY IDENTIFY THE DEVICE. COMPANIES INFORMATION TO CONTACT ABOUT ANY TO REPORT. AB THREE SEVEN ONE ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS ESPECIALLY THE NON VISUAL HAVE A METHOD TO BE COMPENSATED IF INJURED BY IMPROPER USE OF STORAGE OR STORAGE OF THE DEVICES. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. IS JEFF TOM OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF THE BLIND. AND MY BROTHER DR FRED JONES FOR MOST OF HIS LIFE HAD BEEN REFUSED THE OPPORTUNITY HAVE IS SEEN AYE DOG IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WAS TOTALLY COULD HAVE BRAILLE AS GOING TO COLLEGE. BUT HE OVERCAME ALL OF THAT BECAUSE IT IS PHD. AND HE'S A MEMBER OF THE NON VISUAL COMMUNITY ON THE PHONE. THANK YOU WITH THE MESSAGE ALSO YOU MENTION AMENDMENTS YOU'RE YOU'RE TAKING AS AUTHORS OF EVENTS THE ONES THAT ARE LISTED IN THE- IN THE ANALYSIS CORRECT JUST FOR CLARIFICATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT WERE OFFERED BY PRIVACY COMMUNITY. IN BRAVE AND GO INTO THAT YES. OKAY SO LET US MOVE SINCE WE HAVE MISTER JEFF TOM HERE IN. THE CHAMBERS MISTER TOM. YES THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS JEFF TOM I AM THE GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS COMMITTEE CHAIR. FOR THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF LINES. WE'RE THE LARGEST AND OLDEST ORGANIZATION OF CONSUMERS WITH VISION LOSS. AB THREE SEVEN ONE IS A COMMON SENSE SOLUTION. TO A SIGNIFICANT PEDESTRIAN SAFETY CHALLENGE. THE USE OF EITHER VICES SCOOTERS ON THE BIKE HAS BECOME AN EVER IMPORTANT AND GROWING- PORTION OF OUR TRANSPORTATION LANDSCAPE. BUT WITH SUCH CHANGES HAVE PROBLEMS OCCURRED AND ONE OF THEM IS A PEDESTRIANS HAVE SUFFERED INJURIES DUE TO COLLISIONS WITH OR DUE TO FALLING OVER THESE DEVICES WHEN THEY'RE CARELESSLY LEFT ON THE SIDEWALK. THUS SOME SOLUTION MUST BE FOUND IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE PEDESTRIANS WERE INJURED. BY THESE DEVICES. WHETHER THROUGH COLLISIONS OR FALLING OVER THEM OUR- NOT ARE ABLE TO COLLECT FOR THE DAMAGES DUE DUE TO PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE THAT THEY SUFFER. AB THREE SEVEN ONE PROVIDES A SIMPLE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM BY MAKING LIABILITY INSURANCE HELD BY THE SHARED MOBILITY DEVICE COMPANIES APPLICABLE TO SITUATIONS WHERE THE NEGLIGENCE FALLS ON THE PART OF THE COMPANY OR THE END USER. THIS IS A FAIR SOLUTION IT IS NOT A SOLUTION INTENDED TO HARM THE INDUSTRY IN FACT WHEN THE INDUSTRY EMBRACES THE SOLUTION AND MAKES IT WORK. I THINK IT WILL ENHANCE THE ABILITY OF THE INDUSTRY TO THRIVE AND PROSPER. I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GIVE US A TOM. SO DR FRED JONES WHO I BELIEVE IS WITH US ON THE TELEPHONE ARE YOU WITH THE SECTOR JOBS. APOLLONIAN CAPTAIN OF MY BROTHER REGINALD JONES. HOW YOUR DOING THIS AFTERNOON I'M GOING TO ALSO IF DOORS IS- EIGHTY THREE SEVENTY ONE BILLS WELL UNDER TWO CATEGORIES. ATTITUDINAL BARRIERS AS WELL AS ARCHITECTURAL BARRIERS FOR A PERSON WITH A VISUAL IMPAIRMENT THIS BILL WILL ALLEVIATE THE ARCHITECTURAL BARRIERS BECAUSE ONCE A PERSON IS WALKING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE STREET TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET. THEY ARE USING THEIR TAX ALKANE INFORMATION TO ENSURE THAT THEY LIKELY CROSS THE STREET WITHOUT ANY OBSTRUCTION SEVEN EIGHT EIGHT. IN THE MIDDLE OF A WALKWAY FOR A STREET CALLED THEM TO HAVE TO GO AROUND THE HOOTER AND REPOSITION THEMSELVES TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE. LUCRECE ARCHITECTURAL BARRIER BECAUSE IT'S IN THEIR WAY OF GETTING FRANKLY ACROSS THE STREET. AND IT ALSO HAS THE ADDED SIMPLE VERY ATTACHED TO IT BECAUSE THE PERSON WHO LEFT IT THERE HAD NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE CARELESS IN THEIR THOUGHT PROCESS. OF HOW A PERSON WITH A VISUAL IMPAIRMENT OR SOMEONE JUST WALKING ACROSS THE STREET WE GET AROUND THIS VEHICLE. SO THEY'RE ONLY THINKING OF THEMSELVES AND THAT CREATES AN ADDED TO THE VALUE IN OUR SOCIETY TODAY. SO WITH THIS BILL IS PASSED IT WILL ALLEVIATE AND THE MINISTER ADDED TO HER BARRIER AS WELL AS THE ARCHITECTURAL BARRIERS THAT. WILL IMPOSE FOR BLIND PERSON FAKE BECAUSE FROM ONE SIDE OF THE STREET TO THE OTHER. WITHOUT ANY HURT PROPER DANGER AND THEY HAVE THE BRAILLE THERE SO IT GIVES SOMETHING HAPPENED THAT CAUSED THE INJURY THEY CAN ACTUALLY USE THE ROYAL PALM BEACH SCOOTER.

GO AHEAD. OKAY GREAT- GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS BRETT MILLER SENIOR PUBLIC POLICY MANAGER AT THE BANK HERE IN RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO AB THREE SEVENTY ONE TO START WE DO NOT DISPUTE THE AUTHORS GOAL TO PROVIDE EQUITY AND ACCESSIBILITY WHICH IS WHY WE ARE HAPPY TO ADD KEY CONTACT INFORMATION IN BRAILLE AND ALL OF OUR COMBINED FIFTY THOUSAND ELECTRIC SCOOTERS THE MAIN PROBLEM AB THREE SEVENTY ONE SIX OR TRACK IT INJURIES THAT RESULT FROM IMPROPERLY PARKED SCOOTERS OR RECKLESS WRITING WE UNDERSTAND THE SAFETY CHALLENGES WITH MICROBIOLOGY AND WE ARE WORKING HARD TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS. CITY ALT WHERE WE OPERATE ALSO IMPOSED VERY SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS TO MANAGE THEIR PUBLIC RIGHT AWAY BONTA SPEAKING TO PRICE ACTED TO NEW AND MARK DEPENDABLE TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS IMPROVING SAFETY OUTCOMES FOR BOTH WRITERS AND PRODUCTION IS OUR TOP PRIORITY AT THE INDUSTRY INDEED OUR VIABILITY OF THE BUSINESS DEPENDS ON IT THIS COMMITMENT STARTS WITH EDUCATING ALL OF OUR USERS ABOUT THE FRIDAY AND PARKING PRACTICES WHERE THEY ARE REQUIRED TO TAKE A FEW KEY COURT AND LOCAL RULES TEST BEFORE THEIR FIRST FLIGHT OF COURSE WE ALL KNOW THAT NOT EVERYBODY FOLLOWS THE RULES THAT'S WHY WE ALSO TAKE A PARKING. PLACE WE HAVE A CLEAR THREE STRIKES AND YOU'RE OUT POLICY FOR WRITER TO BREAK THE RULES REPEATEDLY SPEND ALSO REQUIRES WRITERS TO TAKE IT INTERPOSED A WHEN THEY COMPLETE THEIR TRAP TO MAKE SURE THEIR SCOOTER PARKED PROPERLY AND OUT OF THE PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY MOST RECENTLY HAS BEEN WE HAVE EVEN STARTED PILOTING REALTIME SIDEWALK PROTECTION TECHNOLOGY WHICH I KNOW SOUNDS IMPOSSIBLE BUT I TRIED IT MYSELF ACTUALLY AND IT REALLY CAN'T READ THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THIEF AND AUDIBLY WARN BOTH RIDERS AND PEDESTRIANS IF SOMEONE USED TO DATE COULD ARE ON THE SIDEWALK. DESILU SINCE WILL LEAD TO BETTER ENFORCEMENT AND COMPLIANCE DATA AND MEANINGFULLY IMPROVED SAFETY OUTCOMES UNFORTUNATELY AB THREE SEVENTY ONE ACCURATE AND GOES BEYOND THIS ISSUE AND REQUIRED INSURANCE THAT WILL AND ACTED TO MAKE MOBILITY CALIFORNIA FOR BOTH SHARED SCOOTERS AND E. BIKES UNLIKE ANY OTHER STATE OR COUNTRY AND AFFECT ANY OTHER PRIVATE INDUSTRY THIS BILL WOULD SET A NEW PRECEDENT BY MAKING SHARED MOBILITY COMPANIES LIABLE FOR THE NEGLIGENCE NEGLIGENCE OF THEIR USERS MEANING WE HAVE COMPANIES WOULD BE LIABLE FOR OUR WRITERS. BEHAVIOR LEAVING THEM OFF THE HOOK FOR THEIR- OWN ACTION. WE DISAGREE THAT THEY CAN THEN BE A- THAT WOULD ALLOW IT TO BE. INTENSIFIED USERNAME. THREE OUT IS THE MEN AND ONLY INCUR. PRO WOULD. AND THESE MICRO. TO PUT THE BILL UP FOR THE- OF OTHERS. NO OTHER COMMERCIAL INSURANCE MODEL POLITICS APPROACH. WHEN YOU RENT A CAR FOR EXAMPLE A DRIVER MUST HAVE THIRD PARTY LIABILITY COVERAGE IN THE STATE TO COVER DAMAGES TO OTHERS. IF THIS THE CURRENT THE DRIVER IT'S WIDELY HELD RESPONSIBLE AND LIABLE FOR THEIR OWN ACTIONS. THE RENTAL CAR COMPANY IS NOT LIABLE THAT THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. AB THREE SEVENTY WHAT WOULD CHANGE THAT ONLY PER SHARE YOU BY CONTRIBUTORS. IN THIS WAY WE BELIEVE THIS BILL UNFAIRLY SINGLED OUT THE SHARED MOBILITY INDUSTRY. IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT THE ONLY MICROBLADING INSURER HAS. STATED IN WRITING THAT THIS WOULD CHANGE THE MICRO BILITY LANDSCAPE OR OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THEY ARE WILLING TO PROVIDE INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR. THAT APPLY TO GOING.FORWARD AS WELL- IF ENACTED SUCH COVERAGE WOULD ALSO BE COST PROHIBITIVE KEEP IN MIND THAT THE POLICY LIMITS PROPOSED IN THIS BILL FOR BODILY INJURY OF A PEDESTRIAN. R. SIXTY SEVEN TIMES HIGHER THAN WHAT IS REQUIRED FOR CARPET CALIFORNIA. SPECIFICALLY I'M REFERRING TO A ONE MILLION DOLLAR MINIMUM FOR SCOOTERS AND BIKES IN A SPELL OR SAY FIFTY THOUSAND MINIMUM LIABILITY COVER FOR CARS. THAT SIMPLY HAD NO REASONABLE OR DATABASES. WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO KEEP THE LINES OF COMMUNICATIONS OPEN AT THIS TIME WE CONTINUE TO REMAIN OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED. BY THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT THAT THE DOES NOT ADDRESS OUR IABILITY CONCERNS BECAUSE THE BILL CONTINUE TO TREAT IT DIFFERENTLY COMPARED TO ANY OTHER GOOD IN OUR ECONOMY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE ON THE LINE WHO. IS SUPPOSED TO AB THREE SEVENTY ONE. OPERATOR PARDON ME MISTER CHAIRMAN ARE YOU CALLING FROM THE FOR THE TELEPHONE LINES AT THE TOP. YES FOR THOSE IN OUR LOCATION. ABSOLUTELY AND IF YOU WERE SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION OF THIS MEASURE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. ONE MOMENT PLEASE WHILE WE PROVIDE THEM THEIR LINE NUMBERS. WE WILL FIRST GO TO LINE THE NUMBER THIRTY THREE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD MORNING MR SURE NUMBERED AND UNITY HERE- OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED ON BEHALF OF THE LINE AND BIRD. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. WE WILL GO TO LINE THIRTY ONE GO AHEAD PLEASE. SH GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS HASN'T CHANGED HELPED WITH THE SUPPORT JUSTIFICATION CALIFORNIA ALSO APPROACH INVESTMENT AT A MOTEL THANK YOU THANK YOU. WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. I THANK YOU AND JUST TO DOUBLE CHECK ANYONE IN THE CHAMBERS MONEY SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF A- NEW ONE. SEEING NONE. ALRIGHT I WILL OFFER YOU MAY CLOSE THE LINES FOR AB THREE SEVENTY ONE I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. I WAS IN THE HOUSE I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING US FOR IT- AND I THINK YOUR BROTHER HAS IT RIGHT IT'S- AN ATTITUDINAL CHANGE I MEAN TO EVEN THINK THROUGH. THE WORST CASE SCENARIO OF MISPLACING A SCOOTER RIGHT- AND I HAVE TO ADMIT. I'VE BEEN YOUR TAINTED KIND OF YOU KNOW HAVING TO WALK AROUND BUT I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THE- TRUE AFFECTED IT HAS ON THOSE WITH SIGHT CHALLENGES HEALTH THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I WANT TO NOTE. YOU KNOW THE COMPANIES THAT SAY WELL NOBODY'S EVER TREAT US LIKE THIS WELL YOU KNOW I QUITE HONESTLY. THESE THESE NEW COMPANIES THEY'RE COMING ONLINE DON'T WANT TO FOLLOW ANY RULES AND SO YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO SET THE RULES AS WE GO ALONG WITH THEM. AND THEY'VE BEEN SUCCESS ONE OF EIGHTEEN. MOST ARE OUR NORMAL KIND OF WAYS WE OPERATE SO YOU KNOW THEY MOVE FAST AND BREAK-THINGS AND SOMETIMES THOSE BROKEN THINGS ARE PEOPLE AND WE NEED TO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING US FORWARD. THIS GOVERNOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND YET AND WE THIS BILL IN PRIVACY- AND- I SUPPORTED THE LEGISLATION. MAKE THE AUTHOR- I THINK- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THE PORTION OF THIS BILL IS DEALING WITH HAVING THE- THE BRAILLE IDENTIFIER SO THAT- YOUR BLIND PERSON WOULD BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHO OWNS THIS THIS DEVICE THANK IMPROPERLY REPORT WE TALKED ABOUT THAT I THINK THAT IS- YOU KNOW A GREAT PORTION OF THIS BILL- THE INSURANCE SEEMS TO BE THE THING WE'RE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT RIGHT AND- AND PEOPLE BROUGHT UP THE ISSUE OF- AND I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES. YOU KNOW JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING IS NEW DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU KNOW. AND WE'RE WOULD THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HEY WHAT'S THE PROPER. RULE TO REGULATE THIS NOW THAT THIS NEW THING IS HERE IT. IT IS A GOOD THING IT'S A POSITIVE THING FOR OUR COMMUNITIES AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE USING THESE TO GET AROUND- BUT- WHEN NEW THINGS COME UP WHAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW DOES OUR LAW. AND OUR BODY OF LAW. APPLY TO THIS THIS NEW THING I MEAN I THINK THAT'S A REALLY COMMON THEME- ON THE INSURANCE SIDE I DIDN'T HEAR OPPOSITION SAY SOMETHING ABOUT HOW WITH CARS STILL LIMIT IS. IS FIFTY THOUSAND OR SOMETHING PER PER USER WHERE THIS WOULD BE. REQUIRED TO BE AT A MILLION. BUT- YOU MAY COULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT LIKE ARE YOU GUYS RESULT POINT THERE WERE WOULD BE ANOTHER LIKE A GENERAL AGGREGATE YEAH THIS IS JANET HOW TO COVER BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT PER. VEHICLE ARE PER USER. IT WOULDN'T HAVE A I BELIEVE IN IT BUT I'LL DOUBLE CHECK BUT I BELIEVE THAT THAT MILLION DOLLAR HALF MILLION. IS WHEN THEY GOING TO CITIES ANYONE TO SET UP. THEIR WHOLE- THE WHOLE INDUSTRY WITHIN THE CITY AND THE CITY REQUIRE THAT MILLION DOLLARS. THIS IS A USING THAT AS WORST CASE SCENARIO. WHAT I OFFERED TO- THE- REPRESENTATIVES. FOR THE- THE INDUSTRY YESTERDAY. IS I DON'T BELIEVE IF YOU RENT. WANTED THE SCOOTERS. FOR FIVE DOLLARS YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE A FIFTEEN DOLLARS. INSURANCE PAYMENT AND SO THAT I WILL WORK WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE IT'S NOT OUT OF WAY OUT OF WHACK. THAT WE WORK TOGETHER WE WORK TOGETHER WE COME UP WITH A- A PRODUCT. THAT WORKS FOR THE INDUSTRY DOESN'T BANKRUPT THEM BUT IT ALSO MAKES SENSE FOR THAT ONE TIME USER. OKAY AND THEN TO THE OPPOSITION YOU MAY RESPOND. AS TO WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT DIFFERENCE IN INSURANCE COVERAGE. AND THEN ALSO IN RESPONDING TO THAT. I KNOW THEY BROUGHT UP THAT- WILL. YOU'RE PUTTING US IN A POSITION WHERE WE WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE NEGLIGENCE OF OUR USERS. HOWEVER WOULDN'T YOU BE ABLE TO CYBERGATE. YOU KNOW AS AN INSURANCE COMPANY CYBERGATE AGAINST A NEGLIGENT. USER PASS AS THEY DO IN THE AUTOMOBILES AND OTHER- INDUSTRIES. THANKS THANKS FOR YOUR QUESTIONS TO YOUR TO YOUR FIRST POINT THE MINIMUM SUMMER BRING TO IS IN THE BILL THERE'S A ONE MILLION DOLLAR MINIMUM FOR SCOOTER AND BIKE COMPANIES PER INCIDENT- OF HARM TO A PEDESTRIAN BURKE IS A FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLAR MINIMUM WHEN IT COMES TO LIABILITY COVER FOR CARS. AND UP AT SIXTY SEVEN TIMES HIGHER IN TERMS OF THE TYPE OF INSURANCE ARE ASKING US FOR AND TO YOUR SECOND POINT ABOUT NEGLIGENCE. AND OUR ABILITY TO CONGREGATE. WE WOULD BE ON THE HOOK. ON THE FRONT END ANY ANY CLAIMS AGAINST US MEANING WE WOULD THEN HAVE TO GO TO COURT. AND PROVED THAT THE USER WAS NEGLIGENT IN THIS CASE TO GET ANY OF OUR MONEY BACK THERE'S NO MODEL FOR THAT EXISTING INSURANCE WHERE THE COMPANIES WOULD HAVE TO ASSUME ALL LIABILITY ON THE FRONT END WITHOUT. WITHOUT ANY PROTECTION. RIGHT I MEAN LIKE IN THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY IF THE PEOPLE DO CYBERGATE AGAINST THE NEGLIGENT DRIVER ALL THE TIME. RIGHT. YEAH WELL WHEN IT COMES TO THE RENTAL CAR INDUSTRY THERE IS THE GREAT COMMANDMENT RIGHT THAT PROTECT RENTAL INSURANCE COMPANIES FROM CLAIMS AGAINST THEM WHEN A DRIVER RENTS A VEHICLE AND ACCIDENTALLY HIT- PEDESTRIAN OR A THIRD PARTY- AND WHEN YOU'RE RENTING A CAR. THE INDIVIDUAL TAKES THE INSURANCE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST LIABILITY COVERAGE THE RENTAL COMPANY DOESN'T FRONT THAT INSURANCE ON THE FRONT END AND THEN PROPER GATE TO GET MONEY BACK- AFTER PROVING IN COURT THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY THE DRIVER WHO WAS AT FAULT THE ASSUMPTION FROM THE BEGINNING AT THAT THE DRIVER WAS AT FAULT AND THAT PERSON IS THE ONE WHO GETS. HIT THIS PEDESTRIAN. THE RENTAL CAR COMPANY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT INCIDENT. RIGHT BUT IT IS STILL IN EFFECT CHANGES THE MODEL BY YOU KNOW ALL REQUIRING US TO PAY ALL OF THESE DAMAGES UP FRONT AND THEN. ON THE BACK END GOING AND TRYING TO PROVE THAT THE USER WITH THAT THOUGHT AND THERE'S NO GUARANTEE OF COURSE THAT THE USER WILL BE ABLE TO PAY THAT. RIGHT RIGHT. WHY YEAH SO THERE ARE A LOT OF IN PRACTICAL TERMS THE DIFFERENCE OKAY WAIT TO THE QUESTIONS IN HIS HOUSE BEFORE YOU RAMBLE ON SO I THINK IT'S A GOOD POINT THAT- I THINK IT IS A GOOD POINT TO MAY WE MAYBE WHAT WE COULD CONSIDER- MISTER JONES SAWYER IS HAVING THE REQUIRE. YOU KNOW THE PURCHASE OF SOME INSURANCE FOR THE USER READ THE MAYBE AS PART OF THEIR FEE THAT THEY PAY YEAH IT LOOKS LIKE MAYBE THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING YOU'RE LOOKING AT. WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF THAT BUT IF YOU JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU AND PRIVACY COMMITTEE- WE TOOK. AMENDMENTS TO PERSUADE ALL OF THAT THEY MAY NOT AGREE WITH IT BUT WE DID MAKE IT- I AFTER. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THAT EFFORT BECAUSE THIS. THIS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT A DRUNK DRIVER WHO WOULD BE NEGLIGENT. BUT IT BUT IDENTIFIED IN LANGUAGE INCLUDING THIS BILL WOULD MEAN TO COMPANIES WOULD NOT BE LIABLE FOR AN INTOXICATED. DRIVER SIDE AND TALKED AT KßT RABBIT SO THAT'S THAT'S A BLACK POINTER WORST CASE SCENARIOS. SO WE ARE GOING TO WORK REAL HARD TO MAKE SURE. WHOEVER IS LIABLE IT STAYS HERE. BUT AS YOU KNOW- IT REALLY CAN'T STOP SOMEONE FROM CORPORATE DEPARTMENTS WHICH IS WHY I THINK HE'S THINKING OF A WITH THE WITH THE LAWYERS AGAIN. I'M NOT A LAWYER SO. PRACTICING LAW WITHOUT A LICENSE- A LOT OF. THESE LAWSUITS THEY GO AFTER THE- DIP WITH A TAKE A DEEP POCKETS. AND THEY MAY STILL. YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAN'T STOP SOMEONE FROM SUING WOULD PUT THE INTENDED THIS BILL. IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PERSONS LIABLE WHO WHO ACTUALLY DID THE INJURY. ACTUALLY PACE. AND PROVIDES THE INSURANCE TO THE AGGRIEVED. RIGHT WELL I MEAN. MY POINT IS I THINK WE SHOULD TRY TO MAKE THIS. WE ASSUME AS POSSIBLE TO WHAT OTHER INDUSTRIES ARE DOING SO RENTAL CARS AS MAY BE A GOOD ONE. THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN RENTAL CARS THOUGH RIGHT THANK YOU WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO GET A RENTAL CAR YOU GOT TO SHOW LICENSE. THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS INVOLVED THAT WITH THESE MOBILE DEVICES LIKE ANYBODY COULD JUST WALK UP. YOU KNOW YOU USE YOUR CARD IN YOUR HAND. AND YOU'RE AND YOU'RE ALL RIGHT I MEAN SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT THE SAFEGUARDS AREN'T REALLY THE SAME. BUT BUT SENATE SOME PEOPLE TRY TO. HAVE INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS BE SOMEWHAT SIMILAR. INTO YOUR POINTS I THINK THAT SHE USED TO HOMEOWNERS ARE. THERE TO LIVE BILLION SHARES A DAY EXISTING HALF. TO COVER THEMSELVES SO. THEIR THEIR WORK AROUNDS WE JUST NEED COOPERATION. FROM THE OTHER SIDE TO GET TO THAT BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE CAN COME WATER REALLY EQUITABLE. SOLUTION THAT WILL WORK FOR ALL PARKS. OKAY THANK YOU FOR. YOUR OTHER QUESTIONS. COMMENTS FROM. THE COMMITTEE. THE STATUS THANK YOU AND I JUST WANTED. ON ENOUGH MR GALLAGHER'S COMMENTS FIRST OF ALL I UNDERSTAND THIS LAW AND BEING- OF. VOLUNTEER FOR THE LIONS CLUB IN AND VOLUNTEERING FOR THE SEEING IMPAIRED I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THIS AND IT'S PROBABLY MISSING I WAS WALKING THE OTHER DAY JUST SEEING THESE SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF ROADS. I MEAN AND HOW DANGEROUS THEY ARE- I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THIS THAT IS MY CONCERN THOUGH BECAUSE I MEAN I WANT TO MAKE THIS BILL SO IT'S FAIR ON BOTH SIDES. AND SO I WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU GUYS WORK. WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES AGAIN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S NEW- BUT I THINK THAT IF WE COULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE- EQUAL TO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WITH THE- REYNOLDS YOU KNOW. THE RENTAL CAR AND WHAT THEIR POLICY IS AND PUTTING THE RESPONSIBILITY ON THE INDIVIDUAL AND I WOULD APPRECIATE THE INTOXICATION. BUT ALSO- RECKLESS RIDING I THINK SHOULD BE IN THERE AS WELL IF IT'S NOT ALREADY- BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT METHODS THAT YOU CAN DO THAT ARE DANGEROUS OUT THERE. SO AT THIS POINT RIGHT NOW- I WOULD SUPPORT IT BUT WOULD ASK THAT SHE WOULD HAVE AMENDMENTS ARE MADE THAT WE CAN MAKE THIS- FAIR ACROSS THE TABLE. AT NIGHT I COMMIT TO THAT FIND ANY COOPERATION FROM THE OTHER SIDE THEIR THEIR- THEIR LOBBYISTS HAVE BEEN VERY UNDERSTANDING HAVE COME MADE THAT COMMITMENT TO. TO GIVE THAT INFORMATION TO THE OTHER SIDE- BUT THEY'VE BEEN. REAL'S CANNOT STUCK IN NOT WANTING TO WORK WITH US IT'S NOT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO THE INSURANCE COMPANIES. WILL MAKE MONEY AND THEY WILL FIGURE OUT A WAY- TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IT'S EQUITABLE I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WE PROBABLY COULD COME UP WITH SOME ANSWER WITH THE INSURANCE COMPANIES- IT'S JUST A WEEK WE NEED TO HELP FROM THE INDUSTRY. TO MAKE THIS SO THAT THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE. AND. WE NEED TO GET THEM THERE BUT- THAT THEY DON'T WANT THIS AT ALL. WELCOME EVERYONE CAN COME THE TABLE. M. AND MAKE THIS A- POLICY. THANK YOU THE- ANOTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MR JONES SAWYER I APPRECIATE THIS AND I THINK. FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN YOU'VE TAKEN AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS. BUT THOSE CONCERNS ARE STILL ARTICULATED BUT WITHOUT ANY HELP. FROM THE INDUSTRY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES AND FRANKLY WE WE'VE HEARD THIS WE'VE GONE THROUGH THE SCENARIO BEFORE NUMBER YEARS AGO WHEN WE DEALT WITH LIFT AND UBER WHO ARE SAYING OH MY GOSH YOU CAN'T MAKE US RESPONSIBLE. FOR OUR DRIVERS AND THEY THEY CONTINUED TO PUT THAT BURDEN ON THE DRIVER'S. AND WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING WAS IT WAS AN INSURANCE. POLICY QUESTION IN THE END IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WAS VERY HAPPY TO START TO WRITE POLICIES FOR THAT SO THIS IS GOING TO RESOLVE IN THAT WAY ANYWAY WHICH IS WHAT YOU'RE DRIVING AT. BUT THESE. DEVICES ARE VERY VERY DIFFERENT THAN CARS ME NOT JUST THE RESPONSIBILITY THE TRAINING THE DRIVER'S LICENSE ISSUES AT ALL BUT WALK AROUND TOWN HERE. I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT CARS DRIVING THE WRONG WAY IN BIKE LANES IS I'M TRYING TO CROSS A ONE WAY STREET. BUT YOU SEE SCOOTERS DOING THAT. ALL THE TIME THERE'S NO SENSE OF ACCOUNTABILITY THESE ARE FUN THEY'RE INTERESTING. THEY'RE WRITTEN. MORE FOR THE JOY OF THEM THEN THE RESPONSIBILITY OR JUST AS A TRANSPORTATION VOTE AND YOU SEE FOLKS ON IDEWALKS AND BIKE LANES. GOING AGAINST TRAFFIC. AND THEN LEADING THEM WHEREVER THEY WANT TO. SO THE ANSWER HAS TO BE THE COMPANY'S HOLDING THEIR- CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTABLE. AND SO YOU'RE APPROACH HERE IS REALLY TRYING TO DO THAT AND I'VE- APPLIED YOUR EFFORT. THE REASONS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO THIS YES IT'S AN IRRITATION FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE CITED. BUT THOSE WHO ARE UNDECIDED IN WHEEL CHAIRS AND STRUGGLING TO GET ALONG. ON SIDEWALKS. WHERE EVER AND JUST WALKING HERE THE THREE BLOCKS AHEAD OF THE CAPITAL THERE WERE ANY NUMBER OF THEM ALL OVER THE PLACE IS AN INAPPROPRIATELY. ALL OVER THE PLACE SO I THINK THE INDUSTRY REALLY NEEDS TO STEP UP HERE AND NOT JUST COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS BUT IF THEY WANT A DIFFERENT SOLUTION PROPOSED A DIFFERENT SOLUTION. AND HELP YOU OUT SO THAT YOUR NAME CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED AND NOT JUST BY THEM SAYING WE'LL DO OUR BEST AND LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON. BUT ACTUALLY TAKE RESPONSIBILITY THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS SO I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU DON'T. COMPROMISE THIS TOO MUCH THE END. TO ACCOMMODATE THE INDUSTRY I WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR ACCOMMODATING TO PEOPLE WHO NEED THE RELIEF FROM THE PROLIFERATION OF THESE DEVICES. BEING LEFT EVERYWHERE BEING DRIVEN EVERYWHERE THAT ARE INAPPROPRIATE SO I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY ON THE RIGHT TRACK. AND I KNOW YOU AND I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO TRY AND DEAL WITH THE INDUSTRY. AS APPROPRIATE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS STILL CARRIES THE TEETH NECESSARY TO CHANGE THOSE BEHAVIORS IN YOUR BROTHER PUT IT VERY WELL THAT ATTITUDE THAT THEIR CUSTOMERS HAVE THAT WE DON'T SEE IN THE RENTAL CAR INDUSTRY SO I THINK YOU'VE HIT ON SOME OF THOSE SPECIFIC DIFFERENCES ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU WITH THAT. YOU MAY CLOSE IT AND THANK YOU YOU SAID IT ALL AND WHAT. I WHAT I WOULD SAY TO THE INDUSTRY IS- THEIR MEMBERS AND THE ASSEMBLY AND SOME IN THE SENATE. THIS IS FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT I SAID IN PRIVACY WHERE. I WAS ASKED TO MAKE THE LAW STRICTER. I AM YOUR HONEST BURKE RIGHT HERE. I AM THAT I'M THE ONE THAT CAN BRING EVERYBODY TOGETHER AND PLEASE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT BECAUSE I'M BEING PUSHED. CLOSE THE TWO. PLACES THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO GO SO- IT WOULD BE GREAT TO COME IN AND MEET WITH ME BUT MOST IMPORTANT- I TELL EVERYONE. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND THIS ISSUE YOU NEED TO CLOSE YOUR EYES TO BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON. THANK YOU.

IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK ON IT I DON'T SEE ANYONE ANYONE IN THE- VIDEO WRITTEN THIS ROOM. NO ONE THERE ARE BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE THEN. QUESTIONS COMMENTS MR GALLAGHER. YEAH SO- I SYMPATHIZE WITH THE ISSUE- ACTUALLY HAD SOME EXPERIENCE WITH MYSELF I HAD I HAD A GUY WHO'S ARE ASKING ME- LITERALLY I MEAN TRYING TO DO MY JOB. HE OF- TAKE MY JOB- SO I BROUGHT SUIT AGAINST HIM- YOU KNOW TO. GET A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER- TO STOP IT FROM TRYING TO DO MY JOB AND I HIS NAME IS GAVIN NEWSOM- AND I YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW HIS ADDRESS. I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE SO YOU KNOW I YOU KNOW WE ATTEMPTED TO SERVE HIM- YOU KNOW DROPPED OFF COPIES OF THE DOCUMENTS AT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HERE IN. BILLION INFORM HIS ATTORNEY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL- INFORMED THEM THAT WE WILL BE SEEKING THAT T. R. O. AND- NO FORCING ON APPEAL YOU KNOW THE THIRD DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS REASONABLE ENOUGH- NOTICE pABOUT HIS ATTORNEY. AND DROPPING OFF DOCUMENTS AT HIS MAIN OFFICE- SO I DEFINITELY SYMPATHIZE I'M NOT EXPECTING YOU TO COMMENT TO THAT- MISTER BYRD. BUT BUT I SYMPATHIZE WITH THE ISSUE- ONE THING THOUGH I MEAN. THAT THAT I HAVE ON THIS- SPECIFIC ISSUES WE PASSED MR LEVINE'S BILL LAST YEAR. DEALING WITH- I THINK WAS LAST YEAR. INVOLVED IN A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS. AND I THINK WHAT WE HAD IN THERE WAS A REQUIREMENT THAT THEIR LEASE BE LIKE REASONABLE DILIGENCE TO TRY AND SERVE- IN THIS IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE SAYING HEY WE'RE WE JUST HAVE TO REPRESENT THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE ADDRESSES. I MEAN IF YOU CONSIDER MAYBE ADDING THAT IN IN THIS PROOF IN THIS BILL TO SAY AT LEAST SOME KIND OF REASONABLE DILIGENCE I TRIED TO SERVE THE PERSON. BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WITH RESTRAINT ORDERS. YOU WANT TO TRY AND GIVE THAT PERSON SOME CHANCE TO RESPOND- I AM VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THE SITUATION BECAUSE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU'RE BEING HARASSED YOU DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE PERSON RIGHT- BUT AT THE SAME TIME. WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE'S RIGHTS WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO BE. HAVING AND YOU KNOW- BUT ENFORCEABLE ORDER AGAINST THEM WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THEY AT LEAST HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY- TO RESPOND SO MAYBE JUST YOU KNOW WAS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU CONSIDER MAYBE. PUT AN END TO THIS BILL AS YOU MOVE FORWARD OR- YEAH I KNOW APPRECIATE THEM AS VICE CHAIR AND I'M GLAD THAT THAT THAT YOU'RE VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THIS BECAUSE HOPEFULLY YOU'LL SUPPORT. THE BILL I'LL TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED WITH MR LEVINE'S BILL WILL REALLY TRY TO DO IS JUST A LINE HARASSMENT WITH THINGS LIKE. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE- AND SOME OF THE OTHER STATUTES THAT ALLOW FOR MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR THE COURT- SO pAT LEAST BE. YEAR OVER YEAR OLD REAL REASON THAT THAT'S NECESSARY- CAN'T SPEAK TO MR LEVINE'S BILL- WITHOUT TAKING A- CLOSE LOOK AT IT BUT I'M OPEN TO YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT'S USED. FOR LESLIE BUT IS REALLY JUST USED WHEN THE NECESSITY ARISES. OKAY MAYBE JUST MAKE IT STAFF AT ALL COMMENT ON THAT MAYBE LIKE IS IT RIGHT NOW IS THAT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE DID WITH LEVIN'S BILL. A FEW YEARS AGO DO YOU KNOW. WILL GET AN ANSWER FOR YOU RIGHT NOW YEAH I JUST I MEAN WE'RE JUST DEALING WITH THIS BILL I THINK THIS TIME BECAUSE RIGHT NOW FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THE BILL JUST REQUIRES THEM TO SAY HEY WE FIGHT I DON'T KNOW THE LOCATION OF THIS PERSON I DON'T KNOW THEIR ADDRESS- MAYBE JUST MAKING IT AGAIN THE SAME AS WHAT WE DO A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS WHERE YOU LEAST HAVE TO SHOW SOME REASONABLE DILIGENCE- TO SERVE THE PERSON. THIS IS KIND OF WHAT I WOULD BE LOOKING FORWARD TO- I'LL TAKE A CLOSER LOOK TO MAKE SURE- MY WITHHOLD MY JUDGEMENT TODAY COMMITTEE BUT LIKE THAT BE SOME LIKE FOR THE FLOOR IF THAT'S A PROVISION THAT YOU CAN INSERT AND LATER YEAH HAVE A TAKE A LOOK AT YOU KNOW I THINK YOU- I DON'T THINK THIS IS BEEN ABUSED IN OTHER CASES YOU KNOW WITH OTHER. IS NOT. THE PARTICULAR STATUTES SO. I DON'T THINK THE COURT WOULD ALLOW IT IF THEY FELT LIKE IT WAS BEING KIND OF ABUSE BUT WILL MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S SOMETHING IN THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT. IT IS REALLY ONLY USE ONE. WHEN IT'S SHOWN TO BE NECESSARY. I REQUEST COMMENTS FOR. COMMITTEE MEMBERS. RIGHT SEEING NONE OF THE MISTER BERMAN THIS BILL MEETS OF THIS CAN BE AT THIS SO YOU'RE GONNA BE LOOKING TO TAKE OF THEM AND SO I HOPE THAT YOU. WE'RE BACK WITH US TO MAKE SURE. THE WERE NOT ON.

IT'S MEDICAL NONCONSENSUAL ACTIONS DURING SEXUAL INTERCOURSE. INCLUDING REMOVING OR REFUSAL TO OUR PROTECTION DURING INTERCOURSE WITHOUT HIS PARTNER'S CONSENT. IT IS A VIOLATION TO THAT PERSON'S BODY. AS SUCH IT IS A VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. MEN WHO ENGAGE IN THIS BEHAVIOR MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AT LEAST BY LAW AT THE TURN WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN TO VICTIMS COME A BILL WOULD LIKE TO MORE PRECAUTIONS. WHILE THEY CONTINUE THEIR LIVES WITH ZERO CONSEQUENCES. IT IS NINE A FLOCK OF ACCOUNTABILITY WHEN NEARLY HALF OF U. S. PREGNANCIES ARE UNINTENDED. PORTION NEARLY THREE MILLION WOMEN EACH YEAR TO TERMINATE FOR CARRY TO TERM A PREGNANCY THEY WERE NOT READY FOR. DISMISSAL ACCOUNTABILITY WITH THOUSANDS OF WOMEN ARE FORCED TO BE SINGLE MOTHERS WHEN THEY REFUSED TO HAVE AN ABORTION. IF NETWORK ACCOUNTABILITY WITH THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN ARE RAISED WITHOUT FATHERS. IT MEANT A LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY WHY ABORTION IS STILL A TOPIC BEING DISCUSSED. IT IS MY BLOCK ACCOUNTABILITY WITH THOUSANDS OF WOMEN AND THEIR PREGNANCIES AND THE NETWORK OF ACCOUNTABILITY ONE THOUSANDTH OF ONE AND A LOT. I THINK THE NEXT SIX I'M EXPECTING MY BEHALF.

MISTER CHAIRMAN WE HAVE NO ONE QUEUING UP TO THIS POINT ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MAY CLOSE THE LINES THAT'LL BRING IT BACK. MISS GONZALEZ. SIMONET SUPPORT THIS BILL- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. BUT ACTUALLY THE WITNESS KIND OF WORRIES ME- SO IF THE CONSEQUENCE THAT WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO SUE FOR IS CHILDBIRTH OR PREGNANCY. THEN IT SEEMS THAT- THAT WE WOULD ALSO NEED TO- BUT TAKING CONSIDERATION CASES THAT DO HAPPEN WHERE WOMEN CLAIM TO BE ON BIRTH CONTROL AND- AND MEN ARE CONSENTING TO SEX UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS AND THEN A WOMAN GETS PREGNANT. THERE'S NO CONSEQUENCE FOR THAT THE PREGNANCY AS A CONSEQUENCE MAKES JUST MAKES ME NERVOUS I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX IT- BUT YOU KNOW THERE ARE. IT AND I'M NOT SUGGESTING WOMEN TRY TO GET BUT YOU KNOW. WE KNOW THAT HAPPENS AND SO- I'M I'M JUST I'M JUST BRINGING UP I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A FIX TO THIS IT'S JUST THAT SEEMS LIKE THAT YEAH IF WORK COMPENSATING PEOPLE FOR. AN AN INTENDED PREGNANCY- WELL THAT THAT MAKES ME NERVOUS. I THINK- THE FRAUD THAT YOU'RE DISCUSSING IS IMPORTANT TO BE DISCUSSED AND SHOULD BE ADDRESSED AT SOME POINT ANOTHER SOLUTION HERE AT THIS POINT BUT I DO THINK THAT. THIS DISCUSSION WORKS BOTH WAYS AND CONSENT WORKS BOTH WAYS IT'S NOT JUST ONE OR THE OTHER- AND- BUT THERE'S PREGNANCY OR STDS. I DO THINK YOU BEING A VALID POINT TO THE DISCUSSION THAT NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT AROUND CONSENT. AND NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED OUT TO BOTH SIDES AND SO I DON'T DISAGREE WITH SOME OF THAT AND I THINK I THINK IT SPEAKS TO THE WORK WE HAVE TO BE DOING ON THE EDUCATION OUT THERE ON BOTH SIDES. HOW MANY WITH THE BILL I JUST. THINK WE NEED TO DISCUSS RIGHT I'M UNCOMFORTABLE EVEN TALKING ABOUT IT BUT IT'S- YOU KNOW THEN YOU START THINKING LIKE. WELL IS A MAN LIABLE IF HE- PLACES THE CONDOM ON INCORRECTLY- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY HE'S HE'S LIABLE UNDER OTHER FORMS OF LIABILITY FOR PRODUCING A CHILD. YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE LAWS THAT THAT HOLD MEN ACCOUNTABLE NOT SENSE FOR CHILD SUPPORT. BUT AS A- AS A CIVIL MATTER- CAUSING A PREGNANCY I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER I'M SORRY I'M JUST KIND OF. LETTING YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING I'D LIKE YOU O CONTINUE TO WORK ON I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD APOLOGIZE I THINK THAT THIS COMFORT YOU FILL SPEAKS TO THE CONVERSATIONS WE NEED TO BE HAPPY ABOUT THE RESPONSIBILITIES WE HAVE BEEN DISTILLATION SHIPS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE- OF. OF THE OF THE DIET A RELATIONSHIP SO ACTUALLY WOULD ASK NOT TO PARTS THEY THINK THE CONVERSATION YOU ARE- ASK MISSING EIGHTEEN IS IMPORTANT. AS A RESULT OF MOTION. I MEAN. OKAY THAT'S MOST WILL. A SECOND OF THIS WHICH I JUST READ SECOND RIGHT THANK YOU SEE GALA. YEAH I MEAN THE ACT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE ACTIONABLE I MEAN ABSOLUTELY LIKE IF YOU KNOW THE- THAT TO USE DECEPTION IN THAT WAY- I THINK EVERYBODY AGREES WHAT I'M WONDERING ABOUT IS CURRENT LAW DOES CURRENT LAW ALREADY ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE BECAUSE- I'M GOING BACK TO MY- MY TOWARDS- AND LAW SCHOOL. YOU KNOW AND IT'S AN INTENTIONAL ACT- AND THERE WAS SEXUAL BATTERY- CONSENT CAN BE IN FACT LIMITED YOU KNOW YOU HEY I'M ONLY GIVING CONSENT TO THIS. TYPE OF THING I THINK THERE WAS THAT CASE AND LAW SCHOOL WAS A I CONSENT TO USING MY- YEAH- ORGANS OR WHATEVER FOR RESEARCH BUT NOT FOR OTHER THINGS TO BE PROFITEERING OFF OF AND THEY WERE FOUND THE HEY THAT'S LIMITED CONSENT THERE'S LIMITED CONSENT HERE YOU KNOW DOES NOT FALL INTO. I MEAN CAN'T PEOPLE ALWAYS ALREADY BRING A CASE FOR SEXUAL BATTERY UNDER THIS PRESENT LOOK I DIDN'T CONSENT TO HAVE UNPROTECTED SEX WITH YOU. YEAH I CONSENTED TO PROTECTED SEX RIGHT SO IS THAT ALREADY ACTIONABLE UNDER CURRENT LAW WITH WITH YOU KNOW THE INTENTIONAL TORT OF SEXUAL BATTERY- AND THEN IT I MEAN TO THE ISSUE OF AND THEN IF THERE'S PARITY I MEAN IF THERE'S A CHILD INVOLVED HERE AND YOU CAN PROVE PARENTAGE THAN. ART OUR CHILD SUPPORT SYSTEM COMES IN LIKE A WILL YOU ARE YOU ARE THE FATHER OF THIS CHILD YOU ARE GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE NOW FOR. THE CARE OF THIS CHILD THAT YOU FATHERED RIGHT SO I MEAN. MAYBE JUST RESPOND THAT LIKE IS THE CURRENT SYSTEM DOESN'T ALLOW FOR PEOPLE TO ALREADY TAKE ACTION IN THIS WAY AND DEAL WITH THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED. AT THANK YOU MR GALLAGHER I REMEMBER HOW MUCH I MISS BEING ON THIS COMMITTEE THAT'S THAT I'M ATTORNEY I WE HAVE BEEN ASKING THIS QUESTION FOR MULTIPLE YEARS AND ASKING FOR A LEGAL EXPERT ADVICE FROM THE ATTORNEYS IN THE BUILDING AND- THEY DO AGREE THAT HAVING CLARIFICATION MAKES IT EASIER. FOR VICTIMS TO KNOW THAT THEY CAN PURSUE DAMAGES- AND THIS CASE AND I THINK WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING ON YOU KNOW THE- PREGNANCY SETTING AND INCLUDE AS TO DECENT INCLUDES A THEIR ABILITY TO BE COMPENSATED FOR BOTH MEDICAL EXPENSES THAT ARE PHYSICAL BUT ALSO MENTAL. AS WELL THAT THAT GO WITH THAT ALONG THE WAY AND I THINK CALLING IT SOMETHING MAKES EDUCATION PIECE A LITTLE BIT EASIER WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO. PREVENT THIS I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THE OTHER DAY IT'S ABOUT HOW DO WE PREVENT THIS OR. NOT YOU KNOW AND THE SITUATIONS. RIGHT- AND THEN LAST YEAR WE HAD. HOW DOES THIS SQUARE OF WHEN THE LAST READY WE HAVEN'T MR WIENER'S BILL SENATOR WIENER'S BILL THAT WAS ABOUT LIKE IF SOMEBODY. I DON'T KNOW IF I'M REMEMBERING CORRECTLY HAS SOMEBODY INTENTIONALLY OR- OR KNEW THAT THEY HAD BEEN S. HIV OR AN STD AND THEN. WE TOOK AWAY SOME OF THE CRIMINALITY ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. THIS BILL IS NOT AVAILABLE BUSINESSES IN A CIVIL SENSE RIGHT DOES IT DOES IT AFFECT. THAT LEGISLATION. THIS BILL IS ONLY IN THE CIVIL PART OF OUR CODE AND NOT AT ALL ON THE PEEL SET OF A PHOTO FOR- YOU DID HAVE LEGISLATION PREVIOUSLY THAT WOULD HAVE MADE THIS MORE IN THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT I WONDER IS THAT IS THAT MAYBE THE MORE APPROPRIATE THING BECAUSE THIS THIS DOES SEEM CRIMINAL I MEAN IT SEEMS IS. A MORE FEELS LIKE A CRIMINAL ACT WHEN SOMEONE DOES- WHEN SOMEBODY DOES THIS RIGHT- I MEAN MIGHT BE MORE APPROPRIATE TO BE IN THE CRIMINAL. STANDPOINT I THINK THE DISCUSSION OF SHOULD BE AN HONOR THE OTHER ARM BOTH ASKING CONTINUE I THINK AT THE END THEY HAVE UNIT AT A MINIMUM AND OUR CIVIL CODE GIVES THE SOMETHING THAT I GUESS THAT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT YOU HAVE- A RIGHT. TO PURSUE- FOR DAMAGES BUT ALSO TO HAVE A DISCUSSION MAKES IT CLEAR THAT THIS IS. WHAT THE MORAL ANY LEGAL. TEN ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISS GARCIA. THE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR THIS BILL AND I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS AROUND THIS BUT THERE'S SOME DEEP QUESTIONS ABOUT CONSENT AND WE AS A SOCIETY OR SO SQUEAMISH WHEN IT COMES TO THE- EVEN TALKING ABOUT. SACHS SEXUAL INTERCOURSE IN SOME OF THOSE INTERACTIONS THAT THE CLARITY THAT YOU'RE PROVIDING HERE. IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND THE- WE'RE NOT. CRIMINALIZING WERE MAKING A SELECTION REALLY RUN THE PREGNANCY IT'S ABOUT THE CREATING A BATTERY FOR THIS ACTION OF STEALTH THING OF.

RIGHT THANK YOU OPERATOR YOU MAY CLOSE ALLIANCE AND I'M GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MISTER GIBSON I SAW THIS AND MADE SOME COMMENTS IN HUMAN SERVICES I APPRECIATE THIS BILL. THE PART THAT. I'M ACTUALLY SAD TO SEE IS THAT YOUR SON SETTING THIS BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH AND I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH. KIDS WERE CAUGHT UP IN THIS WITH COVE IT BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS. IS THERE. ARE SITUATIONS THAT HAPPENED FAR TOO OFTEN WHERE A CHILD IS APPROACHING. EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY AND JUST DOESN'T GET IT JUDICATA BUT THE FACT THAT THEY'VE BEEN REMOVED FROM THE HOME THE FACT THAT THEY'VE- THEY HAVE. REALLY TOUCH THE SYSTEM AT ALL MEANS WE NEED TO SUPPORT THEM AND WE NEED TO SUPPORT THEM BEYOND EIGHTEEN AND THAT I AND I THINK THE- OPPOSITION SUCH AS IT WAS. TO THIS BILL WAS MISPLACED BECAUSE THE QUESTIONS NOT SHOULD WE SUPPORT THESE KIDS ABSOLUTELY WE SHOULD SUPPORT THESE KIDS. THE ISSUE IS WE NEED TO FUND THAT WE NEED TO ADEQUATELY FUND THAT PROGRAM SO THAT. ALL KIDS WHO HAVE TOUCHED THE JUVENILE. THE DEPENDENCY SYSTEM WELL ACTUALLY DEPENDENCY OR DELINQUENCY SYSTEM WHEREVER THEY ARE THAT NEED THE SUPPORT AND THE HELP. THAT NEEDS TO CONTINUE BEYOND THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN AND SO YOU'RE TAKING A STEP I APPRECIATE THAT STEP AND IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO IN THIS CONTEXT. BUT WE HAVE CALIFORNIANS NEED TO BE SMARTER ABOUT THIS AND RECOGNIZE THE NEEDS OF THESE KIDS EVEN BEYOND EIGHTEEN AND THOSE WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH THE TRAUMAS AND GONE THROUGH. THE FAMILY SITUATIONS THAT THEY HAVE. OR DESERVES A LITTLE BIT BETTER SUPPORT ULTIMATELY THAT WE GIVE THEM THAT'S WHAT AB TWELVE WITH ABOUT. FOR DEALING WITH NON MINOR DEPENDENTS. BUT I WOULD SUBMIT THAT WE NEED TO DO BETTER FOR ALL OF THOSE KIDS WHO HAVE NEEDED HELP IN SERVICES ALONG THE WAY. THAT WE HAVE THOSE. SERVICES AVAILABLE TO THEM. SO I APPRECIATE THE BILL HERE AND. I HOPE IT PASSES THAT I'M SURE TO PASS THIS COMMITTEE BUT OVERALL THAN AND THAT WE ARE RESPONSIBLE TO THESE KIDS THANKS FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS DAVIS THANK YOU MISTER GIPSON THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS AYE- YOU KNOW HAD THIS BROUGHT IN AND HUMAN SERVICES AS WELL AND I THINK YOU FOR BEING THE VOICE OF THOSE THAT HAVE NO VOICE.

WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN FOR HIS- COMMENTS AND CERTAINLY WE HAVE TAKEN THOSE COMMENTS THE HEARTS AND- WE WILL LOOK AT HOW WE- WORK ON THIS AND MOVING FORWARD- AS THE- ONE OTHERS SPEAKERS WHO TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL TALKED ABOUT TIED. I BELIEVE THAT- THIS BILL ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE FOUR NINE ABSOLUTELY STANDS UP FOR TIES. OF LIKE HIM AND OTHER PEOPLE- THAT ARE DEALING WITH THIS SITUATION- I ALSO WANT TO MAKE MENTION OF THE LETTER AND THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW AND CERTAINLY- THAT THE SPIRIT OF LAW WHICH HAS NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T BE IN THIS PLACE WHERE WE ARE TODAY. AND SO WE WANT TO CORRECT THE LOSS THE WEEKEND. ACCURATE ADEQUATELY MAKING SURE THAT THE LAW DOES NOT ALLOW PEOPLE LIKE TIßN OTHERS TO FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS- WE BELIEVE THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. DURING THIS PANDEMIC WHICH IS UNUSUAL TIMES THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE. ARE NOT PENALIZED BECAUSE THEY'RE IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AND THEY DON'T FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS BECAUSE THEY TURN. THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT I BOUGHT FROM THIS COMMITTEES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER GIPSON. WE DO HAVE A MOTION A SECOND THAT MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. STONE. HI STONE AYE THANK GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER I'D- CHIU. DAVIES DAVEY SECOND SALAS. GONZALEZ I HOLDEN KALRA KALRA KILEY MAIENSCHEIN FRENCH AND IRIS. THE BILL IS OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER GIPSON. RIGHT WE SEEM TO HAVE. A LACK OF AUTHORS MR LEVINE OR MR MCCARTY. ALL RIGHT SEEING NONE OF THIS GALLAGHER YOU READY PERCENT. MISTER MISTER AT. OKAY RIGHT RIGHT ON. THERE YEAH YOU CAN COME UP AFTER. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TO YOU AB ONE ONE ONE FOUR- WHICH TENDS TO DEAL WITH- YOU KNOW I THINK A VERY DIFFICULT ISSUE- THAT WE ARE ALL- GRAPPLING WITH- IN THESOCIAL MEDIA AROUND- AND- THIS IS THE FIRST ATTEMPT- IN CALIFORNIA OF US TRYING TO APPLY. FIRST AMENDMENT PRINCIPLES TO SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. AND THERE'S ACTUALLY EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A NEW CONTEXT THERE IS ACTUALLY A LOT OF CALIFORNIA CASE LAW ON THIS POINT- REALLY FIRST OF ITS KIND CALIFORNIA CASE LAW ON THIS POINT WHERE WE HAVE IN FACT APPLIED FIRST AMENDMENT PRINCIPLES TO PRIVATE PROPERTY AND NOT JUST AGAINST GOVERNMENT ACTORS- AND THEN INTO RESEARCHING THIS MYSELF- I ACTUALLY HAD NOT READ. CALIFORNIA'S CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION WHEN IT COMES TO FIRST AMENDMENT SPEECH RIGHTS SPEECH RIGHTS WE ALL KNOW THE U. S. CONSTITUTION'S- PROVISION THAT CONGRESS SHALL MAKE NO LAW RIGHT THIS IS ESTABLISHING- YOU KNOW THAT THAT WOULD ABRIDGE THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH. BUT CALIFORNIA'S- REVISION ACTUALLY SAYS EVERY PERSON IT DOESN'T SAY LEGISLATURE SHALL MAKE NO LAW. IT SAYS EVERY PERSON MAY FREELY SPEAK WRITE AND PUBLISH HIS OR HER SENTIMENTS ON ALL SUBJECTS BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ABUSE OF THIS RIGHT. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS PIECE% OF LEGISLATION ATTEMPTS TO DO. IN THAT CALIFORNIA SPIRIT WE SEEK TO PROTECT FUNDAMENTAL SPEECH RIGHTS THE RIGHT OF EVERY PERSON TO FREELY SPEAK WRITE AND PUBLISH WHILE ALSO ENSURING RESPONSIBILITY. FOR ITS ABUSE. AND SO AB ONE ONE FIVE ONE FOUR PROVIDES THAT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. TWITTER FACEBOOK- WOULD BE SUBJECT TO FIRST AMENDMENT PRINCIPLES UNDER THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT PRUNE YARD- DECISION. AND ALSO PROVIDES THAT THE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES HAVE A POLICY MANDATES THAT THEY HAVE A POLICY TO ADDRESS ON PROTECTED FORMS OF SPEECH- WE KNOW MANY OF THESE INCITEMENT TO VIOLENCE. TRUE THREATS. DEFAMATORY STATEMENTS- SO WOULD ENSURE THAT THE PAUL THEY WOULD HAVE. A POLICY IN PLACE TO ADDRESS THOSE TYPES OF STATEMENTS OF THE UNPROTECTED. SPEECH SHOULD IT SEEK TO DO BOTH THINGS WE DO HAVE A LOT OF BILLS. WE HAVE SEVERAL BILLS THIS YEAR THAT ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS A POLICY THAT SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES HAVE. AND I'M WORKING WITH THOSE AUTHORS AS WELL MR GABRIEL AND MR CHOW- BUT WE ALSO NEED TO DO THE SIDE OF PROTECTING SPEECH RIGHTS- GETTING TO THE PRUNE YARD CASE BECAUSE THAT THAT YOU KNOW AND I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE THE COMMITTEE. STAFF DID AN EXCELLENT JOB I THINK OF A REALLY SHOWING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LAW ON THIS POINT- THE PRUNE YARD CASE. DEALT WITH A GROUP OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. WHO HAD GONE TO A PRIVATE SHOPPING CENTER. AND SET UP A CARD TABLE TO PUT TO CIRCULATE- A PETITION. AGAINST A U. N. THE UNITED NATIONS RESOLUTION- CONDEMNING ZIONISM. ON THESE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS SET UP THEIR TABLE THEY'RE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY THE SECURITY CARD CAME OVER AND SAID HEY YOU'RE IN VIOLATION OF OUR PROTOCOLS. FOR THE SHOPPING CENTER AND TOLD THEM TO LEAVE THE PREMISES AND GO OUT. ON TO THE PUBLIC STREET- THE SUPERIOR COURT. THE FIRST COURT HEAR THE CASE SAID YEP THIS PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS. GOVERNMENT'S NOT INVOLVED HERE- YOU DON'T THERE'S NO FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTION AS AGAINST A PRIVATE ACTORS. I WIN THAT ONE UP TO THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT. THIS CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT SAID ACTUALLY NO- THE CALIFORNIA STATE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS. REGARDING SPEECH ARE ACTUALLY STRONGER THAN. ACTUALLY GO FURTHER THAN THE U. S. CONSTITUTION'S. FIRST AMENDMENT. AND IN FACT LOOKING AT PREVIOUS CASE LAW WE'RE DEALING WITH FOR EXAMPLE ANTI WAR DEMONSTRATORS WHO SHOWED UP AT A PRIVATE RAIL YARD RAIL STATION- THAT WAS A PRECEDENT WHERE A CALIFORNIA COURT SAID YES THEY CAN DEMONSTRATE THERE EVEN THOUGH IT WAS PRIVATE PROPERTY- AND THEY FALL THROUGH IN THIS CASE. ALL THE PRECEDENTS AND ESTABLISH THAT NO YES THE STUDENTS. HAD A RIGHT TO SPEAK. ON THIS PRIVATE PROPERTY BECAUSE AND HERE'S THE KEY CRITERIA THAT WE AS A COMMITTEE I THINK SHOULD REALLY BE THINKING ABOUT- THE KEY CRITERIA WAS THIS WAS A PLACE THAT WAS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC COMPLETELY OPEN TO THE PUBLIC- ENTERED ACTUALLY X. SORT OF DISPLACED. WHAT USED TO BE. THE PUBLIC SQUARE YOU KNOW IN IN TRADITIONALLY YOU'D HAVE THE PUBLIC SQUARE LIKE KIND OF IN THE TOWN CENTER. YOU KNOW AND PEOPLE WOULD GATHER THERE AND THEY WOULD SPEAK THEIR PEACE THEY WOULD YOU KNOW- TALK ABOUT DIFFERENT ISSUES OF THE DAY. AND THAT'S WHERE YOU'D SEE A LOT OF THAT EXPRESSION WELL. BY THE TIME THIS CASE ROLLED ROLLED AROUND IN THE SEVENTIES. WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF THAT BE DISPLACED AND NOW YOU KNOW SHOPPING MALLS HAVE BECOME MUCH MORE PREVALENT AND THAT'S WHERE PEOPLE. WERE DOING THAT WELL NOW WE'RE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THERE'S NOT LESS PEOPLE BEING AT SHOPPING MALLS. A LOT OF SHOPPING MALLS GOING OUT OF BUSINESS ACTUALLY- AND CLEARLY MUCH OF OUR POLITICAL DIALOGUE. IN OUR DISCOURSE IS NOW HAPPENING ON SOCIAL MEDIA FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE. THAT'S WHERE IT'S HAPPENING. SO THE NEW PUBLIC SQUARE AND I THINK WE COULD ALL REALLY AGREE ON THIS THE NEW PUBLIC SQUARE IS IN FACT IN FACEBOOK AND TWITTER WE ALL HAVE ACCOUNTS. RIGHT AND IN FACT WE'RE TOLD AS PUBLIC OFFICIALS. IF WE HAVE AN ACCOUNT. AND WE'RE AND WE COMMENT AND PEOPLE ARE COMMENTING ON OURS WE CANNOT ACTUALLY EXCLUDE THOSE PEOPLE FROM COMMENTING BECAUSE WE HAVE CREATED A LIMITED PUBLIC FORUM. SUPREME COURT JUST ACTUALLY RULED THAT THAT IS THE CASE- SO CLEARLY WE NOW HAVE IN SOCIAL MEDIA THE NEW TOWNSQUARE VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT THE PRUNE YARD CASE HAD A SAID ABOUT SHOPPING MALLS. IT'S OPEN TO THE PUBLIC. ANYBODY CAN GET IT FACEBOOK OR TWITTER ACCOUNT YOU GO ON THERE YOU SIGN UP AND YOU GET GOING RIGHT I MEAN NO ONE IS ACTUALLY EXCLUDED. FROM GOING ON THERE AND CERTAINLY PEOPLE SAY ALL KINDS OF THINGS- ON THOSE ACCOUNTS- AND THEN THE OTHER IMPORTANT CRITERIA IS THAT ALSO THAT NO ONE COULD REASONABLY ATTRIBUTE THE SPEECH TO THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY SO THEY SAID IN THIS CASE WILL LOOK NO ONE'S REASONABLY GOING TO ATTRIBUTE THAT THIS PETITION ABOUT ZIONISM IS WHAT THE- OWNERS OF THE SHOPPING MALL THINK. THEY KNOW THAT IT'S THIS GROUP THAT HAS A CARD TABLE THAT'S THEIR SPEECH RIGHT. SO TO ON SOCIAL MEDIA I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR SOMEONE COMMENTING OR SOMEONE POSTING IT'S THEIR VIEW POINT NO ONE WOULD HONESTLY SAY OH THAT'S MARK ZUCKERBERG'S. VIEWPOINT YOU KNOW IT'S VERY CLEAR THIS IS JUST A PLATFORM. THEY'RE NOT THE YOU KNOW THEY ARE NOT THE- THE ONES THAT ARE ACTUALLY SPEAKING AND SO THESE PRINCIPLES FIT RIGHT IN LINE WITH CALIFORNIA CASE LAW. THAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT SHOULD APPLY TO THE SOCIAL MEDIA. PLATFORMS. NOW I KNOW THERE IS A HESITATION WITH THAT BECAUSE IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THIS IS NEW BUT I HAD WERE IN THIS THEME I THINK IN THIS COMMITTEE OF HOW WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO APPLY LEGAL PRINCIPLES TO NEW THINGS. NEW INNOVATIONS THAT HAVE COME IN- AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK THIS IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE TO SAY THAT JUST AS IT WAS THE CASE IN THE SHOPPING MALL CASE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM SHOULD BE SUBJECT. TO THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND FREE SPEECH. PROTECTIONS GET INTO THE SECOND PART. I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT HEY THERE ARE ABUSES AND WE SEEN THOSE ABUSES. SO THAT IS WHY WE OUT INTO THIS BILL A PROVISION THAT REQUIRES. PROTECTED FOUR FORMS OF SPEECH OBSCENITY. INCITEMENT TO VIOLENCE- IT DOES GET SOMEWHAT STICKY AND ALSO I'LL BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT THIS IS HARD TO FIGURE OUT BECAUSE EVERYBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT MISINFORMATION HOW DO WE DEAL WITH MISINFORMATION. AND THE PROBLEM FOR FIRST AMENDMENT. CASE LAWS LOOK. TO SAY QUITE SIMPLY PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO BE WRONG. JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE SAYING SOMETHING THAT IS WRONG. IS NOT REALLY A BASIS FOR SOMEONE TO SUPPRESS THAT SPEECH. TRADITIONALLY THE WAY THAT WE'VE DEALT WITH THAT IS BY THE IS BY FREE SPEECH ITSELF BY PEOPLE CALLING OUT. THE FALSENESS ARE SAYING THAT'S NOT TRUE WHEN YOU HAVE A TRUE FREE MARKET OF SPEECH. IS ALLOWED TO CALL THAT CALL THAT OUT IT'S HARD TO GET AT MISINFORMATION THE BEST WE HAVE REALLY IN THE COMMERCIAL CONTEST FOR FALSE ADVERTISING. YOU KNOW THAT IS UNPROTECTED SPEECH WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO SELL SOMETHING. AND YOU SAY THAT IT DOES SOMETHING IT IN ACTUALLY DOES NOT. YOU KNOW THAT IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE REGULATED AND ACTED UPON- AND THAT BUT THAT'S- THE WINDOW WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH IS HOW DO WE DEAL WITH ABUSES. OF SPEECH THIS DOES ENSURE THAT THOSE THOSE JUST SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. WOULD BE REQUIRED TO HAVE. SUCH A POLICY SO I THINK IT STRIKES THE BALANCE. AND IT DOES SO CONSISTENT WITH CALIFORNIA'S- UNIQUE AND I THINK VERY IMPORTANT FREE SPEECH RIGHTS IN ITS CONSTITUTION- AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS I ASKED YOU KNOW FOR YOUR SUPPORT I KNOW THIS IS THIS IS A NEW. NEW FRONTIER THAT WE'RE DELVING INTO- BUT AS WE MOVE FORWARD I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THIS RIGHT AND CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE THE LEADER ON THIS WE ARE THE HOME. TO THESE LARGE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. AND WE HAVE CERTAINLY ALWAYS BEEN THE BASTION. OF INDIVIDUAL LIBERTIES AND FREE SPEECH THE FREE SPEECH MOVEMENT WAS BORN. OUT AT- OF UC BERKELEY. SO I THINK WE HAVE A YOU KNOW OF THE KEY ROLE TO PLAY HERE AND I WOULD ASK. MY COMMITTEE MEMBERS THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION OF THIS MEASURE THAT I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MY JOINT AUTHORS. I DO NOT HAVE THE JOINT AUTHORS LISTED SO I'M NOT GONNA ALLOW ANOTHER SPEAKER ON THIS IS A KILEY WILL BE ABLE TO SPEAK IN DUE COURSE BUT WE DON'T TYPICALLY ALLOWED CO AUTHORS TO CO PRESENT UNLESS THEY'RE LISTED AS JOINT AUTHORS. A BUBBLY IS A JOINT AUTHORS. NOT ACCORDING TO THE BILL AND PRINT. OKAY WELL. I'LL HAVE HIM MAYBE CLOSE THEN IF THAT WOULD BE ALRIGHT MISTER MISTER CHAIRMAN- I DO HAVE ONE WITNESS HERE IN SUPPORT. PERHAPS YOU COULD DO THAT. WHEN IT COMES BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. BUT I'M I'M SERIOUS YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT I DON'T HAVE YOU INDICATED AND NOBODY TOLD ME THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A JOINT PRESENTATION. NOT THAT. I WANT THE DISCOURSE. BUT I'M ALSO VERY SENSITIVE TO THE NEXT. BILL AUTHOR WHO COMES IN AND WANTS CO AUTHORS TO PRESENT. YEAH OKAY IS JUST AS CO AUTHOR SO I DID HAVE AN INDICATION SO I'D I'D RECOMMEND EITHER BEING A JOINT AUTHORS WERE CLEARING UP WITH ME NEXT TIME. AGAIN IT'S PROCEDURAL PROBLEM I AM NOT REALLY TRYING TO INTERFERE MR KILEY WITH YOUR ABILITY TO SPEAK ON THIS BILL BUT I'M COGNIZANT OF SORT OF THE NEXT BILL IN THE NEXT BILL IN THE NEXT BILL AND IF WE HAVE THE EXPECTATION THAT ANY NUMBER OF CO AUTHORS BECAUSE LOTS OF BILLS HAVE LOTS OF CO AUTHORS. THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE CONDUCIVE TO GETTING BUSINESS DONE IN THE COMING YEAR ALLOWANCE. TO DISCUSS THIS ACTION. I LET'S LET'S. YEAH LET'S DO THAT ONE BRING BACK TO THE COMITTEE. BECAUSE THAT STILL IS ON THE RECORD AND STILL IS A PART OF IT. SO WE'LL MOVE AND MISTER CALDERON I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED THAT THE BILL BEFORE US TODAY. IS THE IS THE TWO SECTIONS BECAUSE WHEN YOU AND I SPOKE ON THE PHONE. AS I INDICATED MY CONCERN FOR. BRING THESE PLATFORMS UNDER THE AMBIT OF. THE PRINTER DECISION BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT I THINK THERE ARE SOME VERY IMPORTANT DISTINCTIONS. THAT THERE YES WE HAVE YET TO SOLVE. SO I WAS EXPECTING. THE BILL TO BE MODIFIED THAT WAS WITH OUR DISCUSSION WAS TO REALLY WHAT IS NOW THE SECOND SECTION SO THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IS RECOMMENDING THAT THE BILL BE MODIFIED THAT THAT YOU TAKE THE AMENDMENT TO DELETE THE FIRST SECTION SECTION AND A AND THEN ALLOW SECTION BE. AND THE DEFINITIONS TO BE THE BILL AND MOVE FORWARD. SO AT MY UNDERSTANDING IS YOU'RE NOT TAKING THAT AS AN ADMIN. I'M NOT AND I MAY PERHAPS I WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN YOU AND I WE TALKED ON THE PHONE. MY UNDERSTANDING OF THAT CONVERSATION IS THAT I WAS GOING TO ATTEMPT TO. TALK TO ADD THE SECOND PART WHICH IS WHY I MADE THE AMENDMENT. TO ADD THE SECOND PART TO ENSURE THAT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS HAD A POLICY. AND THAT WITH THOSE TWO COMBINED. WOULD THAT BE SOMETHING THAT YOU MIGHT. BE SUPPORTIVE OF MY ENTITLED. TO DISCUSS THE DISCUSSION WAS WHAT WOULD BE WHAT WOULD I BE SUPPORTIVE OF. AND I WAS VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT SO I WAS EXPECTING. THE BILL. TO BE AMENDED TO BE SOMETHING THAT YOU AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT. I JUST WANNA BE CLEAR THAT AND I AND I AM NOTICING THAT MEN. MISTER CHAIRMAN IS JUST IT WOULD BE ANY DIFFERENT THAN SAY MISTER CHAO'S BILL WHICH WE WHICH WE HAD. ADDRESS LAST WEEK OR OR MR GABRIEL'S BILL WHICH IS TRYING TO ADJUST. THE pCOMPANIES SHOULD HAVE. OR NOT. REALLY THE SPIRIT OF THIS IS TO SAY LOOK THE FIRST AMENDMENT. SHOULD APPLY I GET THAT THAT YOU DON'T THINK IN THIS CONCERT GREATER THAT'S THAT'S WHY I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED. TO SEE THE IMMENSE BUT JUST CLARIFY. OKAY SO WILL MOVE TO YOUR- YOU HAVE A WITNESS IN SUPPORT WHO HAS IN THE- I DO HAVE A WITNESS INTO THE ROOM HERE TODAY MATT NICK REYNOLDS FROM FROM THE VISITORS JUSTICE INSTITUTE. RIGHT GOOD MORNING TWO CAN YOU HEAR ME. THAT GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MATTHEW MCREYNOLDS OF THE PACIFIC JUSTICE INSTITUTE'S CENTER FOR PUBLIC POLICY HERE IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN FOURTEEN. AND IT'S HARD IMPROVE ON- MR GALLAGHER'S PRESENTATION MEMBER GALLAGHER- BUT THERE'S A LOT THERE THAT WOULD STRONGLY AGREE WITH YEAH I JUST WANT TO. TOUCH ON A COUPLE OF THINGS THEY WERE RAISED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS- FIRST OF ALL THIS IS AN AREA THAT WE HAVE LITIGATED- SUCCESSFULLY AND QUITE A BIT THE LIMITS AN EXTENSION OF THE PERSON YARD LINE OF CASES- UNDER ARTICLE ONE SECTION TO THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT FORTY YEARS AFTER THE US SUPREME COURT IT BEGAN ITS TRADITIONAL SPEECH- FOR ANALYSIS IN HEY VERSUS CHAU- THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT EXTENDED THAT TO. YOU IN PRONE YARD TO THE SHOPPING MALL CONTEXT BECAUSE PUBLIC FORUMS TO CHANGE SO MUCH AND SO HERE WE STAND JUST OVER FORTY YEARS BEYOND PRUNING YARD WITH AGAIN. MAJOR SHIFTS IN WHAT PUBLIC FORUMS ARE AND HOW PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY COMMUNICATING WITH EACH OTHER AND SO. I WOULD JUST- RESPECTFULLY THAT DISAGREE WITH THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS INTERPRETATION OF WHERE WE STAND AFTER THE GOLDEN GATE WAYS DECISION- GOLDEN GATE WAYS BEING THE PLURALITY DECISION IN TWO THOUSAND ONE CAN BY JUSTICE JANICE ROGERS BROWN- WITH GREAT RESPECT FOR JUSTICE BROWN CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT IN OUR STATE COURTS IN A VASTLY DIFFERENT PLACE. TODAY THAN THEY WERE TWENTY YEARS AGO AND WE BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE POISED. TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION THAT MISTER BILL WOULD. ADVANCE TO BRING GREATER- REALITY REALLY TO PUBLIC FORUM DR THE ONE OTHER THING I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION IN CONNECTION WITH THIS. OFFICE FOR THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IS CONCERNED IT WAS VERY CONCERNED TO. SEE THE GO THE ADDITION OF THE POLICY ASPECT OF THE BILL THAT WOULD GO THE DIRECTION OF ATTEMPTING TO SUGGEST DEMONSTRABLY FALSE SPEECH ISN'T PROTECTED SPEECH THAT IS OUT OF LINE WITH WHAT THE US SUPREME COURT HAS HELD THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THE STOLEN VALOR CASE COMES TO MIND- AS WELL AS THE IN A CASE INVOLVING THE SUSAN B. ANTHONY LIST AND IT WITHIN THE SPECIALLY THE LAST FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS YES THE PRINT CORD IS MADE IT. CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT THEY'RE NOT INTERCHANGING. EXPANSIONS OF UNPROTECTED SPEECH AND THEREFORE AT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULDN'T- I'VE SO- WITH THAT I KNOW TIME IS LIMITED HERE SO JUST WAT TO RESPECTFULLY ASK- FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN FOURTEEN THANK YOU THANK YOU OPERATOR IF YOU WOULD NOW OPEN THE LINES FOR OTHERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT WILL TAKE NAME AND AFFILIATION AND SUPPORT.

AND ONCE AGAIN TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB ONE ONE ONE FOUR. THIS PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND WE HAVE NO RESPONSE IN QUEUE WITH THIS TIME. THANK YOU OPERATOR SO WE WILL NOW MOVE TO OPPOSITION I HAVE TWO WITNESSES. LISTED DYLAN HOFFMAN FROM THE INTERNET ASSOCIATION ON THE TELEPHONE AND CAMERON TO METER FROM TECHNET ALSO ON THE TELEPHONE. ARE EITHER OF YOU HERE. YOUR CARE- DON'T OFTEN ON BEHALF OF INTERNET SENSATION REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY- WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE ELEVEN FOURTEEN- WHICH ONE PR SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES ABILITY TO MODERATE THE LEGAL CONTENT ON THEIR PLATFORMS. AND EXPOSE USERS TO MANY FORMS OF HARMFUL SPEECH- ARE COMPLETE SHARE THE AUTHORS- INTERESTS AND INTENT IN FOSTERING DIVERSE ONLINE DISCOURSE- HOWEVER THE BAT WE BELIEVE THAT INTEREST IS NOT SERVED OF OUR COMPANIES ARE REQUIRED TO HOST ALL CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED CONTENT- TODAY PLATFORMS REGULARLY TAKE ACTION AGAINST SPAM MALWARE AND VIRUSES CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL. SCAMS THREATS AND HARASSMENT THE PERSON ASIAN NON CONSENSUAL INTIMATE IMAGES HE SPEECH FALSE INFORMATION AND OTHER CONTENT THAT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED OR NOT IS HARMFUL TO THE USERS OF THEIR SERVICES AND THE PUBLIC AT LARGE AB ELEVEN FOURTEEN WITH A FIFTY MEASURES. ARE TAKEN DAILY BASIS AT RISK BY SEEKING TO LIMIT MODERATION DECISIONS THAT CAN BE UNDERTAKEN WITHOUT THE THREAT OF LIABILITY WE BELIEVE CONSUMERS WILL NOT BENEFIT FROM US. AB ELEVEN FOURTEEN ALSO RAISES SERIOUS CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS AND IS PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW IS WELL ESTABLISHED THAT COMPANIES COVERED BY THE SPELL HAVE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS IN THE CONTROVERSIAL DECISIONS THAT SUCH RIGHTS ARE AN INHERENT PART OF THEIR PROPERTY RIGHT. IN ADDITION BUT HE TO LIMIT THE ABILITY OF INTERNET COMPANIES TO BLOCK REMOVE CONTENTTHEY CONSIDER OBJECTIONABLE THE BILL IS CLEARLY INCONSISTENT PROTECTION TO THIRTY OF THE COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT. SECTION TWO THIRTY BARS ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OUR LIABILITY BE IMPOSED ON INTERNET COMPANIES UNDER STATE LAWS THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THAT THOSE PROTECTIONS APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE CONTENT MANAGER IS CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED. BY US WE BELIEVE AB ELEVEN FOURTEEN IS UNLIKELY TO SURVIVE SCRUTINY IN THE COURTS IF IT WERE. TO PASS AND BE SIGNED INTO LAW. AT THE HEART OF THIS A SIMPLE FACT OF MY CONT ON SOCIAL PLATFORMS REALLY. SOMETIMES DECISION REMOVE OBJECTION CONTENT EASY I'M CALLING. BUT OTHER TIMES THERE DOES WERE AND- CAN DISAGREE.

REGARDLESS OF THE DECISIONS ARE MADE CONSTANTLY AND CONSISTENTLY AS POSSIBLE AS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PIECES OF NEW CONTENT PER SHARED EVERY SINGLE DAY. ACROSS SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS EVERY DIVISION OF THE PERFECT OUR COMPANIES ARE DOING THEIR BEST TO BE A PLACE WHERE IDEAS CAN FLOURISH WHILE ALSO ENFORCING THESE BASIC COMMUNITY STANDARDS- AT ELEVEN FOURTEEN BUT SEVERELY IMPEDE OUR COMPANY'S EFFORTS TO PROVIDE SAFE.

GOOD MORNING SHARE MEMBERS MY NAME IS KEVIN IMAGERY WITH TECH THAT TECHNIP THE NATIONAL BIPARTISAN NETWORK OF TEXIER CONTINUE EXACTLY. PROMOTES THE GROWTH OF INNOVATION ECONOMY. WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB ONE ONE ONE FOR WHICH IS SUBJECT CALIFORNIANS TO MORE OF CNN LEGAL CONTENT ON THE INTERNET BY CREATING LIABILITY RESTS FOR SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES THAT MOVE OBJECTION ALL CONTENT ON THEIR PLATFORMS. OUR MEMBERS ARE COMMITTED TO KEEPING OUR USERS SAFE ONLINE WHICH IS WHY SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES REVIEW MILLIONS OF PIECES OF CONTENT EVERY DAY. IN ORDER TO REMOVE HARMFUL CONTENT THAT COMPLEXITY POLICIES. CALIFORNIANS SHOULD ENCOURAGE COMPANIES HAVE CONTACT POLICIES OF THE GOVERNMENT REMOVAL OF CONTENT SHOWING THE EXPLOITATION OF CHILDREN GLORIA HARASSMENT. GORE WHEN AUGUSTINE STAFF. SO MEDIA COMPANIES UNDER THAT THEY HAVE ADOPTED. TO REMOVE THE FACTIONAL CONTACT. OTHERWISE THEIR USERS WILL BE SUBJECTED TO DANGEROUS LIKE IMAGES OF CHILD ENDANGERMENT FINANCIAL SCAMS SPAM AND OTHER NEFARIOUS LINKS. COMPANIES TAKE THIS RESPONSIBILITY SERIOUSLY REMOVING HARMFUL CONTENT IN AN UNBIASED MANNER WHILE KEEPING THEIR SERVICES OPEN TO A BROAD RANGE OF IDEAS. IN THE OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF CASES REMOVAL OF OFFENSIVE CONTENT IT'S ACCOMPLISH AS INTENDED. HOWEVER THIS YEAR BOTTOM OF CONTACT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS PER DAY SURE THAT BOTH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND HUMAN REVIEWERS ACT COMPANIES CANNOT GET IT RIGHT A 100% OF THE TIME. THANK YOU TRANSACTION THAT FOR ALL WILL NEED TO BE REPAIRS WILL BE FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR TO APPLY POTENTIAL DRACONIAN PENALTIES FOR INSTANCES WHERE CUT. MISFIRED A SIMPLE MISTAKE THIS MAY.

PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THIS TIME ONE TEN ZERO. ONE MOMENT PLEASE. PLEASE STAND BY WILL GO TO WHILE LINE THIRTY FIVE. AND ONE MOMENT PLEASE. ONE THIRTY FIVE GO AHEAD PLEASE. HI THERE MY NAME'S WHAT MUHAMMAD WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL THANKS. AND AT THIS TIME WE HAVE NO FOR THE RESPONSE IN Q. ALL RIGHT THERE THANK YOU OPERATOR YOU CAN CLOSE THE LINES ON A. B. ELEVEN FOURTEEN. SO WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MR GALLAGHER AYE AYE I DO HAVE AN ISSUE AND I DON'T AGREE. THAT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT OVERLY SIMPLISTIC TO SUGGEST C. AS IN PRUNING ARE THAT THESE ARE. LIMITED PUBLIC FORUMS BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT DISTINCTIONS HERE AND THAT IS THE- ANYBODY INCLUDING THE KIDS COULD WALK INTO THE PRISON YARD AND SET UP A TABLE. BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS IN ORDER TO. EXPRESS SPEECH ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM YOU NEED TO BE A MEMBER HAVE AN ACCOUNT AND THOSE COUNTS. ARE OFTEN VETTED AND WE'VE REALLY STRUGGLED WITH WITH WITH THE BOX AND THE OTHER SORT OF ILLEGITIMATE. ACCOUNTS THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED AND WE'VE BEEN HAVE BEEN ASKING THE- AND SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO CLEAN SOME OF THAT UP. ALSO THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS OVER THE YEARS HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO EVEN WEIGH IN ON ANY CONTENT AND I THINK THE PRESSURE OVER THE YEARS HAS FINALLY KIND OF COME TO THE FORE WHERE THEY ARE MORE SENSITIVE TO BEING AND WILLING TO REMOVE HATE SPEECH AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IN FACT OBJECTIONABLE. AND IF WE CREATE A LIMITED PUBLIC FORUM IN THIS CASE IT IN IN THAT CASE WHICH WHICH I WHICH I STILL THINK FUNDAMENTALLY IS. IS NOT APPROPRIATE EVEN UNDER PRUNE YARD AND THE JURISPRUDENCE ALONG THE WAY BUT IF WE- DO. CREATE A LIMITED PUBLIC FORUM IT IS GOING TO HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT ON WHAT WE'RE ASKING. THE PLATFORMS TO DO AND THAT IS REMOVED HATE SPEECH AND REMOVE SPEECH THAT THAT IS OBJECTIONABLE WHICH IS WHY I THINK IT'S MORE PORT AT THIS POINT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PLATFORMS ARE IDENTIFYING VERY CLEAR. ABOUT THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT THE REMOVING OR NOT I THINK THAT IS UNCLEAR TO MOST OF US AND HOW THEY FUNCTION AND HOW THEY FUNCTION BEHIND THE SCENES. ONE OF THE WITNESSES MENTIONED THAT A. I. OKAY I KNOW THAT'S BEING DONE THROUGH A I'VE- BUT WHAT. WAS DEVELOP WHAT ALGORITHMS ARE DRIVING THAT A. I. AND HOW THAT'S BEING PROCESSED OR THINGS THAT I THIN WE ALL IN THE PUBLIC AND THE USERS OF THESE PLATFORMS REALLY NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND. SO THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE STEP I AM VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT TAKING THIS LEAP TO SAYING THAT IT IS A LIMITED PUBLIC FORUM BECAUSE OF THE VERY CLEAR DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN WHAT THESE FORMS ARE. AND SOMETHING LIKE A SHOPPING MALL TWITTER FACEBOOK ARE NOT LIKE SHOPPING MALLS NOW AMAZON AND OTHER COMPANIES THAT ARE PROVIDING ELECTRONIC MARKETPLACES ARE BECAUSE YOU DON'T REALLY NEED TO. HAVE AN pACTUALLY AND A LOT OF THOSE YOU DON'T NEED TO HAVE AN ACCOUNT IN ORDER TO ACQUIRE THE SERVICES BUT TO PARTICIPATE IN SOCIAL MEDIA YOU DO. AND SO THE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY TO HAVE AN INTERACTION WITH THE INDIVIDUAL AND WE WANT TO FACILITATE THAT OTHERWISE IF WE SAY THAT THESE ARE NOW LIMITED PUBLIC FORUMS WE ARE GOING TO BE OPENING UP. ALL KINDS OF POSSIBILITIES FOR SPEECH THAT WE ARE FINALLY IS A SITE SOCIETY TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH THIS THING NOT APPROPRIATE IN THE SETTINGS AND WE WOULD DEFINITELY SORT OF CHILL FOR THAT AND THAT'S WHY I HAD THOUGHT WE WERE IN AGREEMENT. TO TAKE OUT. LINES SIX THROUGH NINE SUBSECTION HEY AND THEN RE LETTER RIGHT AND THAT'S THE AMENDMENT THAT WAS. THAT WAS PROPOSED AND- INSURE THAT WE HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THESE PLATFORMS ARE DOING RATHER THAN THROWING THEM IN APPROPRIATE INTO THE CATEGORY OF LIMITED PUBLIC FORUM. WHICH WOULD THEN FACILITATE THE OR OR BLOCK THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE THE PROGRESS WE HAVE WE HAVE SEEN THEM MAKING IN GOING AFTER HATE SPEECH INAPPROPRIATE SPEECH. WE WOULD BE PUTTING THEM. IN A VERY TOUGH POSITION I THINK NOT MAKING DECISIONS BECAUSE IS WHAT THEY'VE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT BEFORE DECIDING WHAT IS CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED SPEECH WHAT IS A CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED SPEECH. AND I'LL- I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR US TO GO DOWN THAT PATH. SO I AM IT IF. I'D BE HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL WITH THE AMENDMENT IF IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AMENDED THAT I'M RECOMMENDING AND I'M HOPING THAT THIS COMMITTEE. WILL VOTE NO ON THIS BILL SO I HAVE MISTER MAIENSCHEIN AND MISTER KILEY I'M GONNA GO TO MISTER KILEY FIRST JUST BECAUSE OF SORT OF THE INTERACTION HERE WHO WANTED TO ADDRESS ONE OF THE TOPICS IN THE BILL AND THEN I'LL GO TO MISTER MAIENSCHEIN AND- DID ANYONE ELSE. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE PRIVILEGE OF. SPEAKING ON A BILL I'M CO AUTHORING ABOUT FREE SPEECH- I DID WANT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES. RELATED TO SECTION TWO THIRTY- THAT WERE. QUITE APPROPRIATELY BROUGHT UP- IN THAT COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND- I'LL RAISE BY OPPOSITION AND IN THE ANALYSIS BY THE WAY I THOUGHT WAS REALLY WELL DONE. AND THIS IS OBVIOUSLY THE- THE MAJOR- IMPEDIMENT TO ANY ATTEMPT TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE IS THAT- SECTION TWO THIRTY DOES PROVIDE- PRETTY SWEEPING IMMUNITY- BOAST BOTH FOR WHAT IS POSTED AND- FOR WHAT IS. A REMOVED. HOWEVER I THINK THAT THERE ARE A COUPLE ANSWERS TO THAT- IN THIS CONTEXT THE FIRST I HAVE A PRETTY. NARROW POINT- WHICH IS BASED UPON THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT CASE OF HASSLE THE BIRD NOW THE APPELLATE COURT IN THAT CASE- HELD THAT IN. A PARTICULAR CONTEXT- THE LIABILITY SHIELD IS NOT A BAR TO INJUNCTIVE RELIEF THAT MIGHT BE A BAR TO MONETARY RELIEF. BUT NOT TO INJUNCTIVE RELIEF THAT DECISION WAS REVERSED FOR THREE BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT. HOWEVER IT WAS IN A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT POSTURE WERE THERE THEY WERE DEALING WITH LIABILITY FOR POSTING AS OPPOSED TO HEAR DEALING WITH LIABILITY. AFTER REMOVING THERE'S ALSO BEEN A PERHAPS DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SECTION- TWO THIRTY JURISPRUDENCE SINCE THEN THAT WOULD MAKE THE DISSENTING OPINION IN THAT CASE THE ARGUMENTS THERE PERHAPS HAVE MORE FORCE. ABOUT MY BROTHER ARGUMENT. IS THAT- I THINK THAT. THE SECTION TWO THIRTY- JURISPRUDENCE IS A VERY A WIDE AREA OF WATER RIGHT NOW- AND- AS- THIS GALLAGHER MENTION IN HIS PRE. WE EVEN HAVE A RECENT. DECISION OF THE FEDERAL COURT'S SHOWING THAT IN. A PARTICULAR CONTEXT A PUBLIC FIGURE'S POSTS EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE- THROUGH A PRIVATE PLATFORM- CAN BE CONSIDERED GOVERNMENT SPEECH. AND I THINK THERE ARE MANY INDICATIONS THAT- THAT THINGS WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP- IN THAT WAY BECAUSE IT'S A WELL ESTABLISHED PRINCIPLE OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. THE QUOTE THE GOVERNMENT MAY NOT INDUCE ENCOURAGE OR PROMOTE PRIVATE PERSONS TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT IT IS CONSTITUTIONALLY FORBIDDEN. TO ACCOMPLISH AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN WITH SECTION TWO THIRTY. IS THE GOVERNMENT HAS ESSENTIALLY BY GRANTING IMMUNITY. ALLOWED A HANDFUL OF MAJOR COMPANIES- TO BECOME THE MAJOR GATEKEEPERS AFTER PUBLIC DISCOURSE IN OUR SOCIETY. AND I THINK THAT AT THE POINT AT WHICH- THE GOVERNMENT HAS PROVIDED THE LATTER THROUGH WHICH THEY ASSUME THEIR DOMINANT MARKET SHARE. I THEN ACCORDING TO WELL ESTABLISHED PRINT- PRESIDENTS OF THE U. S. SUPREME COURT. THEN THE OBLIGATIONS OF GOVERNMENT NOT TO INTERFERE WITH SPEAK CONSCIOUSLY PROTECT PROTECTED SPEECH- ATTACH AT THAT POINT AS WELL. IN FACT YOU CAN EVEN GO A STEP FURTHER. THERE ARE MULTIPLE EXAMPLES AND I FEEL LIKE THERE IS AN ALLUSION TO THIS EVEN IN THE CHAIR'S REMARKS THAT WE JUST HEARD- REGULATORS AND OF GOVERNMENT. GIVING THESE COMPANIES DIRECTION ON EXACTLY WHAT THEY SHOULD CENSOR AND WHAT HE SHOULD REMOVE. AND AT THAT POINT IT'S VERY CLEAR. THAT THEY HAVE BEEN DEPUTIZED- BY THE STATE OR ACTING. OUT OF FEAR OF- YOU KNOW A PUNITIVE RESPONSE ON THE PART OF THE STATE. AND THERE'S ALSO A VERY WELL ESTABLISHED LINE OF CASES SHOWING THAT CONSTITUTIONAL FREE SPEECH PROTECTIONS. ATTACHED WHEN THAT IS THE CASE SO I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW THIS AREA IS THAT RIGHT. FOR A FURTHER DEVELOPMENT IN CASE LAW I THINK THE- CAL. PROVIDES A IDEAL- YOU KNOW A SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THAT DEVELOPMENT NOT ONLY BECAUSE WE'RE DEALING HERE WITH A LOT OF CALIFORNIA COMPANIES- BUT ALSO FOR THE REASON. MR GALLAGHER CITED IN HIS REMARKS THE CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF I THINK IT'S ONLY A FEW STATES THAT GOES BEYOND THE U. S. CONSTITUTION'S PROHIBITION OF GOVERNMENT INTERFERE ON GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE WITH SPEECH BUT ACTUALLY HAS AN INFORMATIVE GUARANTEE. OF THE RIGHT TO SPEAK FREELY WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE A PRUNE YARD PRINCIPLE IN CALIFORNIA- WHERE IT DOESN'T EXIST UNDER THE US CONSTITUTION IT DOESN'T EXIST. IN MANY OTHER STATES AND I FIND IT VERY HARD TO BELIEVE THAT WHEN THE DRAFTERS OF SECTION TWO THIRTY CAME UP WITH THIS IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX IT WAS THEIR INTENTION. TO PREEMPT STATE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. AS FAR AS PRE FREE SPEECH IS CONCERNED BECAUSE AT THAT POINT IN TIME. IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ENVISIONED THAT. THESE COMPANIES ARE JUST A FEW OF THEM. WOULD BECOME SUCH GATEKEEPERS A PUBLIC DISCOURSE THAT THE STATE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS ARE IMPLICATED BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENED. AND IT HAPPENED BECAUSE OF THE ASSISTANCE THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO THESE COMPANIES. BY THE LIABILITY SHIELD OF SECTION TWO THIRTY SO. I THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT THOSE PARTICULAR LEGAL CONCERNS OUGHT NOT TO CARRY THE DAY HERE- AND JUST BRIEFLY. YOU KNOW AS FAR AS AS THE POLICY GOES I MEAN I THINK THAT. MIGHT FAVORITE EXPRESSION OF THIS IDEA COMES FROM JOHN STUART MILL'S SORT OF CLASSICAL% ENLIGHTENMENT LIBERAL THINKER HE SAID THE PECULIAR EVIL OF SILENCING THE EXPRESSION OF AN OPINION IS IT IS ROBBING THOSE WHO TO STAND FOR THE OPINION. STILL MORE THAN THOSE WHO HOLD IT. IF THE IDEA IS RIGHT THEY ARE DEPRIVED OF THE OPPORTUNITY OF EXCHANGING ERROR FOR TRUTH IF WRONG THEY LOSE WHAT IS ALMOST AS GREAT A BENEFIT. THE CLEARER PERCEPTION AND LIVELIER IMPRESSION OF TRUTH. PRODUCED BY ITS COLLISION WITH AIR. THERE ARE SOME TRULY ODIOUS ID. HEY SPEECH. TERRIBLE THINGS THAT ARE BEING EXPRESSED ON THE INTERNET BUT BY REMOVING THEM FROM THE MOST POPULAR SITES THEY DON'T GO AWAY THEY SIMPLY BUBBLE OFTEN RESURFACE IN AREAS WHERE THERE SN'T THE SAME OPPORTUNITY FOR REASONS COUNTER ARGUMENT AND PERSUASION WHICH IS WHY THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF HISTORY. THE AS OUR SUPREME COURT HAS PUT IT THE REMEDY HAS ALWAYS BEEN MORE SPEECH NOT ENFORCED SILENCE AND WHAT IS BEING SUPPRESSED IS NOT JUST THESE TRULY ODIOUS IDEAS BUT A MUCH BROADER SWATH OF SPEECH USED THE TERM STILL NOT SHOWING AFFECTED SOMEHOW REFER TO YOU KNOW- NOT ENOUGH CENSORSHIP BUT THE ACTUAL CONCEPT OF CHILLING FACT IS THAT- SOMEONE WILL STEER FAR CLEAR OF THE UNLAWFUL ZONE AND IT'S ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH THINGS LIKE DEACTIVATING YOUR TWITTER ACCOUNT. OR YOUR FACEBOOK ACCOUNT MIGHT BE A BIG PART OF SOMEONE'S LIFE AND YOU SAY WELL IF YOU VIOLATE SOME NEBULOUS TERMS WE'RE GOING TO DELETE THAT ENTIRELY THEN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT WHAT THEY DO AND SAY AND IT'S AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF SPEECH. IT IS SUPPRESSED AS A RESULT I'LL GIVE YOU I JUST A FINAL EXAMPLE THAT WE SAW RECENTLY THAT A PUBLIC ROUNDTABLE HOSTED BY FLORIDA GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS WAS REMOVED FROM YOU TOO THIS IS A ROUND TABLE WITH PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS IN EPIDEMIOLOGISTS FROM HARVARD FROM STANFORD AND FROM OXFORD AND IT WAS- PROVIDING INSIGHT. INTO WHY GOVERNOR TO SANTOS HAS PURSUED THE POLICIES THAT HE HAS THAT BUT HE WAS REMOVED SUPPOSEDLY BECAUSE THERE WAS A BRIEF MENTION IN THAT VIDEO OF HOW- ONE OF THE EXPERTS THERE DIDN'T BELIEVE IT WAS ADVISABLE TO HAVE KIDS UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE- WEAR MASKS AND YOU TO PROVE IT SAYING THIS RUNS CONTRARY TO YOU KNOW PUBLIC HEALTH OPINION ACROSS THE GLOBE. THAT'S ACTUALLY WRONG THAT WHAT THE EXPERTS SAID WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE WHO'S OWN GUIDANCE BUT LET'S SAY THAT YOU'RE A CRITIC OF GOVERNOR TO SANTA'S IN HIS POLICIES WOULD YOU WANT. TO HAVE ACCESS TO A VIDEO THE HIDES INSIDE INTO WHY PURSUED COURSE THE HE HAS ORDER CAN YOU CAN HAVE AN ON. AND CAN BE PREPARED TO MAKE COUNTER ARGUMENTS THAT SPEAK TO THOSE ISSUES. SO I THINK WE'RE DEALING WITH SOMETHING MUCH MORE IMPORTANT- HERE THAN. APPS THE COMMENTS THAT WE'VE HEARD- THAT WOULD LEAD US TO BELIEVE I THINK IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT MEASURE AND IT'S A WAY TO CALIFORNIA AND SORT OF BE CLAIM. ITS ROLE AS A NATIONAL LEADER IN THESE PRINCIPLES OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH. SO THANK YOU MR GALLAGHER FOR BRINGING THIS FORTRESS MEASURES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER MISTER CHAIRMAN- MICHELLE YES ME TO GIVE IT MY- THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION I HAVE- THIS IS LIKE A- COMPLICATED LAW SCHOOL THE FINAL QUESTION FINAL EXAM QUESTION BY THE WAY RIGHT- LET ME ADDRESS. WHAT I LIKE TO DRESS IS KIND OF BREAKING INTO TWO PARTS. I'M AN ADDRESS WHAT AT LEAST I FEEL IS YOUR LACK LESS COMPELLING. AT ISSUE HERE I THINK IT'S- JUST KIND OF THE NOBODY LIKES I THINK IT'S YOU IF YOU AGREE. TO WHICH IS SORT OF THIS POLICY. ISSUE PART OF IT IS. EVEN SO S. B. ASSUMING THIS WOULD THAT A REQUIREMENT. OF A PRIVATE COMPANY TO HAVE A CERTAIN POLICY. IS A GOOD IDEA OR SOMETHING WE SHOULD PURSUE THE POLICY BUT I THINK WE WOULD AGREE WOULD PROBABLY BE PRETTY BROAD AND PRETTY BASIC RIGHT WOULD BE ENOUGH WE WANT TO HAVE FAIR AND HONEST OPEN COMMUNICATION RIGHT OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES. IT WOULD PUT. THEN THE ONUS BACK ON THE LEGISLATURE TO REVIEW WHETHER. A POLICY OF A PRIVATE COMPANY IS GOOD ENOUGH. AND THEN FROM THERE HOW IS IT IN FOUR STRAIGHT BECAUSE THE COMPANY WOULD SAY WE ARE WE'RE FORCING IT WE WERE EVERYTHING WE FOUND HERE IS TRYING TO BE FAIR AND HONEST AND OPEN WHATEVER KIND OF. SO CALLED VERY BROAD. HOW HOW AS A PRACTICAL MATTER OR- WOULD YOU GET AT A EVEN. WHY WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO TELL A PRIVATE COMPANY TO DEVELOP A POLICY RIGHT WE ALL GET AWAY WITH ME. YOU MIGHT EVEN REMEMBER BACK IN WORKING FOR A LAW FIRM MY FIRST DAY THERE I GOT OUR FIRM'S POLICY RIGHT POLICY MA'AM MOSTLY WHEN HE STARTED JOB RIGHT THERE'S A LOT OF POLICIES HUGE BOOK OF POLICIES VERY BROADLY WRITTEN BY AN HR. CONSULTANT RIGHT. HOW WOULD YOU GET OUT EVEN SO EVEN A WHY YOU THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE PRIVATE COMPANIES DO THAT AND THEN BE EVEN IF THEY DID HOW THE LEGISLATURE REVIEW. WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THE- EIGHT TRILLION SOCIAL MEDIA POSTINGS AND SALE YOU SHOULD HAVE GRABBED THIS ONE MAGICIAN AND GRAB THAT ONE. YEAH I KNOW IT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND I AND- IT'S SOMETHING I'VE BY STRUGGLE WITH I MEAN THAT'S WHY I SORT OF BROUGHT IN THE POLICY SECONDARILY THIS STARTED OFF AS A BILL JUST APPLYING FIRST AMENDMENT PRINCIPLES TO THE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES. BUT I GET YOU KNOW WHY A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE ABUSES THAT WERE SEEN RIGHT- THEN IF YOU TALK TO THAT THE TECH COMPANY THE SOCIAL MEDIA COMES A SAY WHAT WE HAVE POLICIES THE PROBLEM IS NOBODY REALLY KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE. I MEAN THEY CAN READ A MINUTE I DON'T THINK THEY REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW THEY'RE EVEN APPLIED OR ENFORCED RIGHT. AND SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE I TRIED TO GET YEAH I'M TRYING TO. THREAD THE NEEDLE HERE. IF YOU WILL BY SAYING LOOK I THINK WE NEED FREE SPEECH PROTECTIONS. WE NEED TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO SPEAK FREELY- ON THESE PLATFORMS WHICH I THINK HAVE BECOME THE PUBLIC SQUARE RIGHT THE NEW PUBLIC SQUARE. WELL THEN ALSO LIKE HAVING. YOU KNOW SOMETHING AND I TO ME THE BEST WAY TO MAYBE DO HAS A SAY IN THE REALM OF UNPROTECTED SPEECH WHERE THE WHERE THE COURTS HAVE ALREADY RULED THESE THINGS ARE UNPROTECTED OBSCENITY. INCITEMENT TO VIOLENCE TRUE THREATS THE DEFAMATORY STATEMENTS. THAT THEN PUT THE ONUS ON THE BUSINESSES SAY HEY HAVE A POLICY THAT ADDRESSES. THOSE THINGS THAT. I THINK THAT'S WHERE MOST PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED THAT THERE ISN'T ONE RIGHT. YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT THEN HOW DO YOU ENFORCE THAT RIGHT AND WHO WHO AND FORCES THAT HE SAYS YOUR POLICY IS GOOD ENOUGH. THE I THINK THOSE ARE THE CHALLENGES MISTER CHOW HAS A BILL. TRYING TO DO THE SAME THING. THE OTHER WE PASSED. LAST WEEK- ED. MEMBER GABRIEL I THINK ALSO HAS A BILL WHERE HE'S TRYING TO DELPH THIS AND I THINK WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THAT RIGHT POLICY IT'S TOUGH. ON THE FLIP SIDE. BUMPERS AMENDMENT. WE MIGHT WE MIGHT. WE MIGHT HAVE A FEELING THAT WE I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD POLICY FOR FIRST AMENDMENT TO APPLY I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE CHAIRMAN IS SAYING HE DOESN'T THINK IT'LL ULTIMATELY BE GOOD POLICY FOR FIRST AMENDMENT TO APPLY TO SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. I DON'T THINK IT REALLY MATTERS WHETHER NOT YOU AGREE WITH THAT TO GET POLICY OR NOT IT'S REALLY ABOUT DOES THE LAW REQUIRE IT AND IT SURE IT SURE LOOKS TO ME LIKE IT IS GOING TO ULTIMATELY THAT'S WHERE THIS IS GOING. BECAUSE THE PRINCIPLES IN PRUNE YARD ARE VERY MUCH OF THE PLUGGABLE YOU KNOW TO SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS I DON'T HAVE BEEN LABOR THE POLICY PART IN ANYTHING EXCEPT I FIND THAT THE LESSER OF THE COMPELLING RIGHT. I GUESS I'LL JUST SAY IS IT WOULD END UP I THINK AS A PRACTICAL MATTER IT WOULD END UP WITH. I THINK THE GOVERNMENT DEVELOPING A POLICY FOR PRIVATE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY AND SO THEN IT WOULD BE A GOVERNMENT HANDED DOWN POLICY TO BE IN. SECONDARILY I JUST DON'T SEE HOW THAT WOULD EVER BE ENFORCED BECAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE BROAD ENOUGH AND WHAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS OF WHAT'S FAIR AND WHAT'S NOT FAIR WHAT'S UP ON AS MUCH NOT OPEN AND NOT OPEN. SO I WOULD I WOULD JUST SAY IS A PRIME I JUST DON'T SEE HOW THAT COULD EVER BOTH FROM A SORT OF PHILOSOPHICAL STANDPOINT REALLY MORE SO FROM A PRACTICAL STANDPOINT HOW THAT COULD WORK BUT I WANT TO GET INTO THE WHAT I THINK IS MORE COMPELLING ABOUT THIS OKAY. BECAUSE THERE THERE HAS BEEN SUCH AS- BAD CHANGE IN OUR LIFETIMES AS TO HOW WORK HOW THE PUBLIC IS COMMUNICATED WITH BOTH BY THE. GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE PARTIES- AND TYPICALLY. IN FIRST. CASES RIGHT THE LEVEL OF REVIEW IS SORT OF WHAT. DETERMINES THE OUTCOME FOR EXAMPLE TIME PLACE AND MANNER. WE HAVE A VERY LOW LEVEL REVIEW BECAUSE WE AGREE OF THE GOVERNMENT. AT THE- CAMP. REQUIRE PEOPLE TO HAVE A PERMIT FOR PARADE THANK WE- REGRET THAT WE SHOULDN'T DO PARADES THROUGH NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. SO YOU DO THAT IF THEY HAVE PARKS YOU HAVE TO GET A PERMIT FOR A PART. AGAIN BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THERE'S- WE CAN DISCRIMINATE HOW TO HAND OUT THE PERMITS. WHEN WE- LET IT GET THAT WEEK WE AGREE WE COLLECTIVELY AGREE THAT YOU CAN HAVE YOU HAVE TO PROTEST FOR A PROPOSAL PART. OF A PARTY AT A PARK OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE. IN SORT OF IN THE MIDDLE. IS IN A CONTACT WE AGREE THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME REGULATION HAS ON. CAN'T YELL FIRE IN A CROWDED ELEVATOR YOU CAN'T INCITE VIOLENCE. IN THE. MOST RESTRICTIVE IS OPINION. GOVERNMENT WE DON'T WANT WE COLLECT WE DON'T THE GOVERNMENT TO EXPRESS AN OPINION WHETHER SOME OF. FAVOR SIR RELIGIOUS. A SPECIFIC IN. OUTCOME AND SO ALMOST IN EVERY CASE WHERE THE GOVERNMENT ENDS UP EXPRESSING OPINIONS. HE GETS IT AND GOES COURT CORNER OR WHERE THEY EXCLUDE SOMEONE'S APPARENT RACISM IS BEING RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S- IT'S THE IDEA BEHIND IT IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULDN'T. HAVE A PREFERRED OPINION WE- TYPICALLY. OVERWHELMINGLY NEGATIVELY FORMALLY PUSHED BACK ON- SOCIAL MEDIA. COMPANIES ARE PRIVATE RIGHT THEY HAVE THEY CAN KIND OF INCLUDE AND EXCLUDE. IF AND THEN WE AS THE PUBLIC HAVE THE RIGHT TO TURN IT OFF. OR NOT YOU HAVE AN ACCOUNT. EVERYBODY CHOOSES HAVE AN ACCOUNT. RIGHT OR THEY CAN CHOOSE HOW MUCH TIME THEY SPEND THE DAY YOU KNOW. SCROLLING THROUGH THAT'S UP TO ALL OF US WOULD BE ZERO MINUTES TODAY COULD BE SOME PEOPLE ON IT EIGHT TEN HOURS WE KNOW THAT- BUT I DO THINK THAT'S A- WHY. NOT THE FIRST MINUTE GETS A GOVERNMENT CONTACT CONTACT. WHEREAS PRIVATE PARTY CONTACT WITH. IS DIFFERENT IN MANY MANY WAYS NOT LEAST OF WHICH IS WE CAN GET AWAY FROM IT AND WHEN YOU CAN'T GET AWAY FROM GOVERNMENT ACTION. GOVERNMENT IS PERFORMING CERTAIN CERTAIN FUNCTIONS ONLY GOVERNMENT. DOES AS OPPOSED TO WHAT THIS PRIVATE COMPANIES DOING WHICH IS IT'S IN SOME WAY DISSEMINATING INFORMATION. BUT BECAUSE IT'S BEING MORE SUCCESSFUL IN SOME WAYS AND BY SIX SEVEN FIVE I IS LOOKING. DOES IT MEAN IN MY VIEW THAT MR SHOULD BE HELD THAT THAT SHOULD BE HELD TO DIFFERENT STANDARDS AND- LET'S GO BACK FOR A TIME. BACK BEFORE YOUR AND MY TIME. THERE WERE THREE MAJOR NEWS CHANNELS RIGHT WALTER CRONKITE TO OTHERS AND PROBABLY 99% OF AMERICANS GET THEIR NEWS FROM ONE OF THOSE THREE CHANNELS. BUT JUST BECAUSE THAT WAS THE PREFERRED METHOD OF VIEWING DIDN'T MEAN THAT THEY HAD DIFFERENT STANDARDS AND THEY HAVE TO HEAR TO. A GREAT. THAT I DON'T BELIEVE SO I MEAN. AND AGAIN I WAS BEFORE MY TIME RIGHT DID YOU WE DID GO TO LAW SCHOOL AFTER THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THEY DIDN'T HAVE DIFFERENT STANDARDS EIGHT HERE TOO BECAUSE FOR WHATEVER REASON EVERYBODY TURN TO THEM FOR NEWS RIGHT ON THE BUT I DON'T THINK THERE WAS AN ISSUE OF THOSE NEWS COMPANIES EXCLUDING VIEWERS AND SAYING. YOU KNOW OR MAYBE WE ARE TAKING THEM ARE SAYING YOU CAN'T WATCH OUR SHOW. RIGHT I MEAN. SO A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT CONTACT MAYBE BUT THEY ALSO. I MEAN THEY HAD ON SOME OF MAKE A DECISION WHAT'S GOING TO BE INCLUDED OR- EXCLUDED ON A THIRTY MINUTE BROADCAST. RIGHT AND THEY WERE THEY WERE THEY WERE THE ONES WHO ACTUALLY CREATED THE CONTENT AND SOCIAL MEDIA IT'S ACTUALLY THE PEOPLE WHO WATCHING OR PEOPLE USERS WHO ARE CREATING THE CONTENT ALL YES ALTHOUGH I GUESS A NEW STORY THAT A CAMERA PERSON IS GOING ON RECORDING WITH A FIRE THE NEWS CHANNEL IS A GREAT. FINALLY THE RECORDING THE FIRING THREE LANE AT TASKRABBIT THEY'RE THE ONES DECIDING TO. VIDEO THAT FIRE AND THAT'S MY DOES NOT LIKE THE PERSON THAT STARTED THE FIRE THE FIRE WAS LIKE HEY COME THAT IS I THINK CONFINED ME THAT INFO IS RIGHT IT'S NOT. THERE THERE REPLANT THEIR MAKING A CHOICE AND WHAT THEY COVER RIGHT RIGHT AND SAME AND SAME IN THIS INSTANCE RIGHT NOW PEOPLE CAN GET THEIR NEWS FROM NEWSPAPERS AND GET FROM TELEVISION STATIONS YOU KNOW FROM SOCIAL MEDIA WE GET FROM ALL DIFFERENT BLOG I MEAN MILLIONS OF RESOURCES THAT GET THEIR-NEWS FROM. BECAUSE SOCIAL MEDIA- AND I HAVE HERE YOU KNOW I'VE SPENT. LITTLE TIME ON SOCIAL. WITH MY DAUGHTERS I JUST JUST. I THINK IT IS. IT'S A TREMENDOUS IN A WASTE OF NOT GETTING ON AND LIVING YOUR ACTUAL LIFE AS OPPOSED TO LIFE LONG. SO I'M I'M NOT HERE TO YOU KNOW SEE WHAT IT BUT- BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE. DO IT I DON'T. I DON'T SEE WHY THAT WOULD INCORPORATE FIRST AMENDMENT STAND STANDARDS AND A DIFFERENT. SORT OF WAY SOME COULD YOU SPEAK TO THAT. I'D SAY IT IT IS B. OF THE CASE LAW IN CALIFORNIA. THE LANDMARK CASE BE IMPROVING YOUR SHOPPING CENTER I DON'T SEE HOW. THESE GUYS ARE ANY DIFFERENT THAN NOT SHOPPING MALL THERE. AGAIN NOT SHOPPING MALL IS COMPLETELY PRIVATE. BUT THEY OPEN THEMSELVES UP TO A ANYBODY CAN COME ON COME IN HERE COMING HERE FOR FREE. SAMPLE SOCIAL MEDIA THERE I DON'T THINK THERE'S A REAL HIGH BAR. YEAH I THINK WE COULD TALK ALL REASONABLY AGREE THERE'S NOT A HIGH BAR TO GET A SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT OKAY LIKE. IT'S NOT DIFFICULT IT'S NOT LIKE GETTING A LICENSE OR SOMETHING THAT- I MEAN ANYBODY CAN GET ON THERE YOU SIGN UP. YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS RIGHT WHEN NOT WHICH NO ONE READS- BUT YOU AGREE AND- ANYBODY IS VERY OPEN TO THE PUBLIC. AND AGAIN LIKE THE SPEECH IS REALLY NOT SOMETHING THAT ANYBODY WOULD REASONABLY ATTRIBUTE TO. THE COMPANY ITSELF SO IT'S NOT A COMPELLED SPEECH TYPE SITUATION WHERE. WHERE SOMEBODY IS THINKING- FACEBOOK IS SAYING THIS NO IT'S- IS VERY CLEAR THERE'S A USER. HIS NAME IS THEY'RE THEY'RE COMMENTING THERE POSTING IT'S THEIR SPEECH. SO IT KNOWS TO THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES CALIFORNIA CASE LAW IN OUR IN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL. FOR FREE SPEECH AMEND YOU KNOW- AMENDMENT TO OUR CONSTITUTION- PROVIDES THAT YES IN FACT PRIVATE PROPERTY CAN BE. A PLACE THAT WOULD BE A PUBLIC FORUM WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR POINT THAT YOU RAISED ON THAT EXACT POINT. YOU SAID LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IN REYES MARK ZUCKERBERG NO ONE IT SEEMS IS A MARK ZUCKERBERG'S RIGHT RIGHT OR FACEBOOK THE COMPANY. YEAH YEAH BUT ALSO. MARK SEVERAL WAS. HE THESE NO ONE ELSE CONFUSES HIM WITH THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT EITHER. RIGHT HE'S A PRIVATE PARTY. HE CREATED SUCCESS SUCCESSFUL SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY AND YOU KNOW WHATEVER HAS YOU PLAY LIKE HE'S JUST A PRIVATE CITIZEN RIGHT WE CARE ABOUT THAT FROM THE FIRST MOMENT WAS THE GOVERNMENT PRECISELY BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT PERFORMS FUNCTIONS THAT MARK ZUCKERBERG DOESN'T PERFORM HE'S JUST CREATED A COMPANY. IT'S ALWAYS NOT HE DOESN'T PICK UP THE TRASH HAVE A POLICE FORCE HAVE A FAR HAVE AN AMBULANCE ALL THESE THINGS THAT A CITY OR A GOVERNMENT DOES. DOES WHAT HAPPENS ON FACEBOOK THE FACT PUBLIC FUNCTIONS LIKE ELECTIONS FOR EXAMPLE WHAT I WOULD SAY THOUGH THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE FIRST MINUTES CAN AT YES I WOULD SAY YES IT DOES. BUT IT'S STILL PRIVATE COMPANY DOES A POLITICAL CONSULTANT. FOR THE REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRATIC PARTY YEAH. THEY AFFECT IT BUT THAT'S NOT WITH THE FIRST MEMBERS FIRST MEMBERS AGAIN AFTER THE GOVERNMENT. SO JUST BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOK AT 6 OR TWO OR THREE OR FOUR FIVE SUCH MAKE UP DOES NOT MEAN THEN THAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT NEEDS TO BE PEOPLE AND THAT THE OTHER THING WAS HE TOO IS. TALK ABOUT CABLE NEWS CHANNEL FOR EXAMPLE THEY ALL HAVE BIASES NOW IN A WAY THAT PROBABLY DIDN'T EXIST FIFTY YEARS AGO. MAYBE TEN YEARS AGO. BUT THAT ALSO GOES TO THEIR CREDIBILITY. PEOPLE CAN SAY YOU KNOW WHAT. I'M GOING TO GIVE THAT NEWS STORY THE- I'M VIEWING THAT THROUGH THE FACT THAT THIS CABLE NEWS CHANNEL WHICH HAS A BIAS IN THIS CERTAIN AREA. THEY WAY OUT. SUPPOSED CREDIBILITY SAME WITH SOCIAL MEDIA T. YOU SAID WE ALL AGREE THE BAR IS VERY LOW SO WE CAN GO ON THERE AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT. ANY PERSON COMPOSED ANY CRAZY THING ON HERE. AND HOW DO I KNOW IT'S TRUE YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE- ALL THAT OUT WHEN WE LOOK AT SOCIAL MEDIA THE VERY LOW BAR. YEAH SO I MEAN WHAT I WOULD SAY IN RESPONSE THAT IS ONE THE CALIFORNIA CASE LAW DISAGREES WITH YOU THE YES IT DOES APPLY NOT JUST THE GOVERNMENT. BUT ALSO IT DOES APPLY TO PRIVATE ACTORS. AND THEN I WOULD SAY THERE IS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN CABLE NEWS SHOWS. AND SOCIAL MEDIA CABLE NEWS SHOWS HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OVER THEIR CONTENT. THEY'RE SAYING WE'RE GOING TO BROADCAST THIS SHOW. ALL THESE THINGS WHEREAS ON SOCIAL MEDIA IT'S COMPLETELY GENERATED BY USERS USERS ARE THE ONES WHO GENERATE THE CONTENT. AND I THINK THAT IS A PRETTY DIFFERENT DISTINCTION OKAY SO I'M AND THEN IF YOU START SAYING WELL NO YOU CAN'T USE THAT YEAH I'M INVITING YOU ON TO COME AND SPEAK IN. AND CREATE THE CONTENT. BUT NOW I'M GOING TO GET IN THE BUSINESS OF CONTENT AND SAY NO IF I CAN'T HAVE YOU- YOU SPEAKING BECAUSE I DON'T THIS DOESN'T MEET MY POLICY RIGHT OR WHATEVER RIGHT. THAT'S WHERE IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FROM LIKE THE- THIS REGIONAL CABLE NEWS. AND I AGREED TO MEND THE DEVOLUTION OF MEDIA. OVER TIME IS WHAT IS KIND OF LED US TO THIS POINT IN THE FIRST PLACE NOBODY. SEE SOMEONE AS AN OBJECT THERE IS NO WALTER CRONKITE. YEAH THAT YOUR PEOPLE. DO AS AN OBJECTIVE. OBSERVER FACT YOU KNOW JUST GIVING THE FACTS ANYMORE RIGHT SO AND SO PEOPLE HAVE GONE TO. OTHER AVENUES FOR OUR SON I WOULD ALSO SAY. I DON'T KNOW THE CALIFORNIA SPORTIST AND I ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT SOME NOT OPINING ON REALLY. RIGHT BUT TOMORROW WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO MY POINT ON ON SOCCER BURKE IS. THE SO HE'S A PRIVATE ET TO WHATEVER EXTENT HE'S GOT A VIEWPOINT WOULD WOULDN'T YOU AGREE IT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN. A. GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL. ACTIONS WHO IS ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT. YEAH HE'S NOT A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL RIGHT YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT AGAIN I JUST LIKE THIS CASE LAWS SAID IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE THIS CAN APPLY WHEN CERTAIN PRINCIPLES ARE MET AND I AND I AND IN SOME RESPECT THEY ARE A VICTIM OF THEIR OWN SUCCESS. IF YOU WILL BECAUSE IT NOW HAS BECOME SO INFLUENTIAL. AND I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE THAT MAN STUFF THAT IS SAID ON FACEBOOK AND TWITTER AND- THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE AGAIN INFORMATION IT LITERALLY INFLUENCES OUTCOMES IT LITERALLY INFLUENCES ELECTIONS. BOARD ABOUT BOTS AND INTERFERENCE BECAUSE PEOPLE COULD PUT FAKE STUFF ON THERE RIGHT AND- THAT RILES PEOPLE UP. WE OBVIOUSLY SEE THAT IT HAS BECOME SO INFLUENTIAL IN AFFECTS PUBLIC LIFE SO MUCH WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT TUNE YARDS SAYS IS ANOTHER FACTOR THAT YOU. WHEN THIS IS AFFECTING THE PUBLIC INTEREST SO MUCH THAT YES IN FACT. THIS CAN BECOME A PUBLIC FORUM- THAT IS SUBJECT TO FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTIONS YEAH TAX DOLLARS ARE CREATING. A SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY NOT FUNDING THE SOCIAL NO CAMPAIGN AGAIN IN A WAY THAT THERE FOR ME THEY WERE THERE FORMING THE NEW THEY DEVELOP A SHOPPING CENTER EITHER. RIGHT HOW MAY BE I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE ABOUT THAT. I WOULD STILL SUGGEST. KIND OF APPLES AND ORANGES BUT LET'S TAKE AWAY THAT SHOPPING CENTER EXAMPLES IS JUST THAT THERE'S NOT. THERE'S NO GOVERNMENT DOLLARS GOING INTO FORM A BODY THAT'S PERFORMING GOVERNMENT ACTIONS THAT WOULD THEN BRING IN. THE FIRST MINUTE AND ONE REASON BY THE WAY ONE REASON WHY I THINK. THEY'RE GOING AFTER FOR EXAMPLE HEATH SPEECH HARPER OR SEEMS LIKE A MORE CONCERTED EFFORT FOR BOX IN A MORE CONCERTED EFFORT. IS BECAUSE CONSUMERS HAVE ASKED FOR THEY HAVE SAID WERE CHALLENGING THE CREDIBILITY. OF WHAT WERE YOU SEEN ON HERE. AND WE DON'T WANT TO KEEP USING THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM. IF THEY TURN A BLIND EYE TO HATE SPEECH OR THEY TURN A BLIND EYE TO BOTS SO IT'S ACTUALLY BEING. LARGELY MARKET DRIVEN THEY'RE SAYING WE'RE GOING TO. QUIT CLICKING ON THIS SITE IF THEY DON'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT THESE THINGS. ISN'T IT IT'S NOT NICE TO THE GOVERNMENT ST HAVE A POLICY ON IT. BECAUSE THEY THEY A THEY PROBABLY ALREADY DO AND BE I KNOW HOW FACT THAT THAT THAT THAT THIS IS IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE IN EFFECT. IN AND OF ITSELF RIGHT. BUT I MEAN. I JUST THINK IT'S IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER I MEAN ACCORDING TO THE CHAIRMAN. THERE AND THEY ARE NOT RESPONDING TO WHAT PEOPLE ARE WANTING THEM TO DO RIGHT. THIRTY NINE THEY ARE WILL NOT GO THERE AND THEY ARE AND I MEAN AND THEY KIND OF. IT DEPENDS ON IT DEPENDS ON YOUR PERSPECTIVE I THINK I THINK THREE I GUESS WHAT I'D SAY IS I THINK NOW WHY WOULD I AGREE THAT THEY DISCUSSION ITS CONSUMER FOR HIS REYES CONSUMER DRIVEN IS WHAT'S BUSINESSES RESPOND TO CONSUMERS. RIGHT NOW SO THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE HOW EFFECTIVE THEY'RE BEING OUT IT IS DEBATABLE. BUT JUST THE FACT THAT. THEY'RE STARTING TO DO IT AND STARTING TO ADDRESS IT. I THINK IN A MORE PHOTO MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY KNOW MORE FOCUSED AND DIRECT MANNER. IS BECAUSE CONSUMERS- HAVE ASKED FOR THAT. SO YOU KNOW. AND I WOULD JUST REACH OUT IS AND WITH THE SAME. AND FREE SPEECH IS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH MARKET CONSUMERS- AND SUPPLY AND DEMAND IT'S ACTUALLY FREE SPEECH. IS COMPLETELY CONSISTENT WITH THAT. ACT WHICH IMPORTANT BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS WHY I THINK. THIS WOULD END UP NOT. THAT WOULD HAVE AGAINST YOUR THIS. WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING BECAUSE THE MARKET IS. HAVING A CHANGE IN A WAY THAT IT'S TELLING THEM TO HAVE A POLICY MANUAL FIRST FOR EXAMPLE. THE WAY. SO I UNDERSTAND THAT. STILL HAVE REGULATION ON EITHER SIDE IS WHAT YOU'RE SAID REALLY TO TWO THIRTY IS. YEAH I MEAN YOU'RE KIND OF SAYING THAT I DON'T THINK THE POLICY WOULD BE IT'S THE RIGHT SCOPE FOR. US AS A LEGISLATORS TRYING TO DETERMINE WHAT POLICY SHOULD BE FOR A PRIVATE SOCIAL MEDIA. AND THEN FROM THERE WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR SOME. SO I THINK THAT THAT THAT I CAN GET THEM I THINK WHERE THE FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUES I JUST I THINK EQUATING A SOCIAL MEDIA. COMPANY WITH THE GOVERNMENT. JUST BECAUSE A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE LOOKING AT. AND MY GUESS I DON'T KNOW THIS MY GUESS ACTUALLY IT'S PROBABLY EVEN IF THE LATTER AND ACTUALLY IS PROBABLY LESS THAN THE THREE MAJOR NETWORKS BACK IN NINETEEN THE FIFTIES OF THE FORTIES ACTUALLY. JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE REALLY ONLY THREE AND NOW SYSTEM IS COMPETING WITH. SMALLER BUT STILL NEWSPAPERS STILL CABLE NEWS CHANNEL STILL. SO THE PERCENTAGE OF WOULD STILL PROBABLY BE LOVE ACTUALLY. BUT ANY OF THAT I JUST I DON'T SEE IT AS- THE ANYBODY COULD CONFUSE MARK ZUCKERBERG FOR EXAMPLE AS A GOVERNMENT ACTORS- IS IT BECAUSE SOMEBODY. WE SHOULD BE. PUT RIGHT WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY. WE GET PUT ON THE CEO OF. FACEBOOK KEEP TO THEMSELVES. RIGHT WE PUT GOVERNMENT PEOPLE THERE ARE WE- WE GO TO GET A LICENSE ONLY WITH US AND WE- WE EXPECT TO NOT HAVE. CERTAIN THINGS ARE CURRENTLY WE DON'T HAVE TO SIGN SOMETHING SENIR CERTAIN RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OR POLITICAL BELIEFS OR OPINIONS BELIEFS WHEN WE GET A DRIVER'S LICENSE REALLY WOULD BE OFFENDED BY THAT BECAUSE IT IS THE GOVERNMENT SORT OF TELLING US WELL WE'LL GIVE YOU DRIVERS RIGHT. BUT IN EXCHANGE YOU GOT TO DO THIS AND THAT'S WORKING IN THAT IN SOME SMALL SENSE IS WHY THE RATE IS BY THE FIRST MINISTER AND I JUST DON'T SEE THOSE SAME THINGS WHEN IT COMES TO A SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY THAT. WOULD TO RACKED. JUST BECAUSE A SOMEWHAT SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE ON SOCIAL MEDIA WE'VE NOW GOT TO MAKE THIS EQUATE THEM WITH THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. WHICH IS MUCH BIGGER AND HAS MUCH BROADER RESPONSIBILITIES. AND THINGS THAT IT DOES TO INTERACT WITH OUR EVERYDAY LIFE IN A WAY THAT SOCIAL MEDIA WHICH WE CAN TURN OFF ANYTIME YOU WANT. CAN DELETE IT WE CANNOT GO ON THERE WE HAVE THE ULTIMATE SAY. WE DON'T KNOW IT WOULD ALWAYS UTILIZE OUR POWER WE AS A SOCIETY ON THAT TO JUST SAY NO I'M A QUIT LISTENING TO YOU. RIGHT WHEN I DO THAT SO FOR ME I DON'T GET THERE AND I WANT EXPLAIN TO WHY YOU'RE ASKING BE THOUGHTFUL I HOPE I HAVE BEEN- AS TO WHY I JUST DON'T SEE THE THAT A SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY IS THE EQUIVALENT OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FIRST AMENDMENT. PROTECTIONS AS ARE YOU ARE ALWAYS THOUGHTFUL THANK YOU. ASSIGNOR MAIENSCHEIN SO I APPRECIATE THE DIFFICULT DISCUSSION RIGHT MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I APPRECIATE THE DIALOGUE I THINK THAT- SUMMER GALLAGHER YOU CERTAINLY ABOUT FOR THE BILL THAT. REQUIRES I THINK A LOT OF INSIGHT AND IN CONVERSATION AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IN A THOROUGH ANALYSIS. THAT WAS DONE ON BOTH OF THE TWO MAJOR ITEMS. OTHER BEING BROUGHT FORWARD WITH THIS BILL- I AGREE WITH THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS BUT I ALSO DO THINK THAT. THE PROVISION OF THE BILL THAT DOES REQUIRE- THE DOCKING OF POLICIES AND MECHANISMS FOR ADDRESSING- THE MONTHLY PAAS CONTENTS IN AN UNPROTECTED SPEECH- IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK THAT IS BORN OUT. IN IN RECENT YEARS OR SOMETHING THAT I THINK NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED- AND SO- TO THAT END AND I I'M I'M GOING TO MAKE AN ATTEMPT. AT A MOTION HEARING OF COURSE. THE PLAN WOULD HAVE WITH IT'S ALWAYS A TO THE TUNE AUTHORED A- THEY- HOW THEY WANT TO PROCEED- UPON EMOTIONALLY MADE BUT I'D LIKE TO MAKE. THE MOST A MOTION DO WITH MEN'S AS RECOMMENDED BY COMMITTEE- AND TO BE CLEAR- AS STATED IN THE ANALYSIS ON. THE TOP OF PAGE TEND TO DELETE LINE SIXTY NINE IN THE TEXT THE BILL AND. I WAS FOR THIS SECTION OF THE BILL THAT MOST SEEM TO BE IN AGREEMENT WITH TO MOVE FORWARD. WITH THE PARTY DEBATE WE'VE HAD ON THE FIRST SECTION AND YOU CAN ALWAYS AGREE ON EVERY SPECIAL WHEN IT COMES TO LEGAL MATTERS- BUT I DO THINK THAT HOPEFULLY WE CAN AGREE THAT. OF THE PORTION OF THE BILL THE THAT- THAT THE- COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IS A SUGGESTED. SUPPORT OF- CAN CONTINUE AND WE CAN STILL HAVE- CONTINUE DEBATE AND THE MOVEMENT FORWARD ON THAT ITEM SO THAT'S MY QUESTION THANK YOU SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND THAT MOTION IS. TO PASS AS AMENDED IN THE AMENDMENT IS LISTED AT THE TOP OF PAGE TEN. WHICH WOULD BE IN THE BILL TO DELETE LINES SIX THROUGH NINE AND THEN RE LETTER THE SUBDIVISIONS ACCORDINGLY. TO HAVE A SECOND AND WE HAVE A SECOND THANK YOU. RIGHT. GONZALEZ- FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU I ACTUALLY THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT TO DISCUSS AND I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT- YOU KNOW WE COULD ALL TALK LEGAL THEORY IN CASE ON WE DON'T KNOW RIGHT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN BOTH IN IN A CALIFORNIA A CHALLENGE TO THIS LIKE ANY OF THE BILLS WE PASS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN- IN THE STATE OR FEDERALLY- IF WE CREATE THIS. MY CONCERN IS THIS THESE TWO PORTIONS ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH ANOTHER ONE ANOTHER I BELIEVE BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE WOULD HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT ON SELF REGULATION IF WE SAID THERE ARE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS RIGHT NO I WOULD THINK FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE- THE SOCIAL CLAPPED THAT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS WOULD WOULD REALLY CARE ON THE SITE ALLOWING ALL SPEECH- BECAUSE- IT'S EASIER THAN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT. WHAT EXACTLY- SHOULD BE LIMITED AND I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE AND PERHAPS MY OWN EXPERIENCES. IT IS NEARING WHAT YOU KNOW I I'M WORRIED ABOUT. IS THAT FREE SPEECH TO WRITE MY ADDRESS ON A SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM. NOT ME FOR SOMEBODY ELSE AFTER EVERYONE MY POST TO POST MY PERSONAL ADDRESS MAYBE YOU KNOW IS IT FREE SPEECH AFTER MY PERSONAL POST TO POST MY DAUGHTER'S PICTURE WHERE SHE WORKS WHERE SHE LIVES. MIGHT BE MIGHT BE FREE SPEECH BUT RIGHT NOW LET'S LEAVE- WE CAN TRY TO SOMETIMES SUCCESSFULLY SOMETIMES NOT SUCCESSFULLY GET THE MEDIA PLATFORMS TO TAKE THESE AND THESE ARE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO ME NOT ONCE. IT IN IN A ROUND OF NOT DIRECT THREATS BUT TRACKING PEOPLE WHO ARE CLEARLY UPSET IN IN RAGE WITH ME TO HAVE INFORMATION THAT COULD LEAD TO A THREAT. I DON'T KNOW IF- GIVING YOU KNOW. BILLS FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS ON A SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM- WHICH HAS BECOME KIND OF THIS UNIQUE AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO I TRULY DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS BUT IT IT'S IT OTHERWISE BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE STARTING TO FINALLY GET TO A SITUATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND I'M TALKING AS AN ADULT AND YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE STUFF THAT HAPPENS WITH KIDS WITH ONE ANOTHER THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED ABSOLUTELY FREE SPEECH- I WOULD PREFER MORE REGULATION NOT LESS. AND SO. IN THIS PLATFORM I THINK IT'S HIGHLY DESTRUCTIVE I THINK IT IS- VERY DANGEROUS. AND WE ARE IT'S BECOMING MORE DANGEROUS NOT LESS SO. WITH THAT I CAN'T SUPPORT- YOUR BILL IN ITS ENTIRETY BUT AM SUPPORTING OBVIOUSLY THE AMENDED VERSION TO. PROVIDE MORE CLARITY FOR CONSUMERS. NO AND I APPRECIATE THAT I MEAN IT IT THIS IS A DIFFICULT ISSUE IT IS YEAH MY I FACED A THREAT MYSELF- THIS YEAR TO. YOU- FROM AN ANGRY PERSON- AND YOU KNOW. THE CURRENT STATUS OF FIRST AMENDMENT LAWS IT INCITEMENT TO VIOLENCE OR TRUE THREATS ARE NOT PROTECTED SPEECH YOU KNOW AND SO THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO LIKE I SAID THREAD THE NEEDLE ON THIS BY SAYING LOOK WE NEED TO PROTECT THE RIGHT FOR PEOPLE TO SPEAK WHAT THEY BELIEVE IN WHAT THAT YOU KNOW HOW AND THE FREEDOM TO SPEAK AND PUBLISH WHILE ALSO HAVING SOMETHING THAT'S WHY I'M- ADDING THE SECOND COMPONENT THAT. I THINK THAT'S WHAT MAKES MY BILL DIFFERENT FROM WHAT OTHERS ARE DOING IS I'M DOING. BOTH THINGS. AND THAT'S WHY PROBABLY IF YOU GUYS IF YOU PASSAGE. YOU KNOW WITH THIS AMENDMENT I PROBABLY WOULD MOVE FOR WITH IT BECAUSE OTHERS ARE ALREADY DOING THAT I MEAN. AS I SAID- SOME MEMBER CHAO. IS WORKING ON. YOU KNOW- COMPANIES HAVING A POLICY I THINK SO AS A- CIMBER GABRIEL'S SAID MR GALLAGHER. THERE WASN'T REALLY A QUESTION IN THERE AND WE HAD LOTS OF KIND OF CALL I MEAN BACK AND FORTH WHICH WHICH- I'VE BEEN PAID I WAS THE- ONE WE HAVE- AND AS OF YET. NO NO NO I DO UNDERSTAND. IT ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS. OKAY THIS MAJOR JUST TO CLARIFY WHAT COULD YOU CLARIFY WHAT THE MOTION S. YES THE MOTION IS TO PASS THE BILL AS AMENDED AND THE AMENDMENT WOULD BE TO DELETE SECTION HEY SO STRIKE LINE SIXTY NINE WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY SECTION HEY WHICH IS THE PART THAT SAYS THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS WILL BECOME TRADITIONAL WILL BE TREATED AS TRADITIONAL FIRST AMENDMENT FORMS. AND IT LEAVES THE SECOND PIECE WHICH IS ASKING SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO DEVELOP POLICIES AND BE CLEAR. ABOUT WHAT THOSE POLICIES ARE. AND THAT'S WHAT MY RECOMMENDATION IS OR WAS AND THAT'S WHAT ACTUALLY AFTER MY DISCUSSION WITH MR GALLAGHER WHO WANTED THE BILL TO MOVE FORWARD THAT THAT WOULD BE. WOOD BEEN ACCEPTABLE TO JUST ONE WITH THE AMENDMENT IS ONE LITTLE CLARIFICATION IT WOULD JUST LEAVE THE POLICY IN THE BILL THAT MANDATES SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES TO HAVE A POLICY YES ADDRESS SEEN ON PROTECTED FORMS OF SPEECH- THAT I LISTED EARLIER. OKAY THANK YOU SO OKAY. WE CLEAR BUT A MEASURE CLEAR BUT THE MOMENTS ARE. RIGHT JUST FOR MY COMMENTS I WANT TO BE CLEAR HERE AND SOMETHING THAT MR KILEY SAID AND I'M SORRY THAT THAT HE'S NOT HERE TO SEE THIS WAS ATTRIBUTING SOMETHING TO ME. AND I REALIZED THAT I WAS. IN EXACT IN MY SPEECH WHEN I WAS USING THE WORD WE I WAS NOT MEANING WE AS GOVERNMENT I WAS MEETING WE AS SOCIETY CONTROLLING THESE BECAUSE I FIND THAT IF WHAT WE DO IS MY OBJECTION TO THIS IS. THE STATE LEGISLATURE AFFIRMATIVELY SAYS THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ARE IN FACT FIRST AMENDMENT FOR. THAT WE ARE NOW IS A GOVERNMENT WEIGHING IN ON WHAT THEY WHAT WE EXPECT ACTIONS WITH THOSE PLATFORMS TO BE ABLE TO DO. I THINK. I DON'T SEE THAT THERE'S A CHALLENGE WITH FREE SPEECH FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THOSE FORMS BUT FOR US. TO GO TO AND TO SAY THAT A PRIVATE COMPANY A SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM IS NOW BY DEFINITION. BY THE BY THE LEGISLATURE GOING FORWARD SAYING YOU ARE NOW YOU ARE A REPLACEMENT FOR THE PUBLIC FORUM. FOR THE PUBLIC SQUARE. I THINK THAT'S NOT TRUE I THINK THAT'S IT OVERSIMPLIFICATION I THINK THERE ARE OTHER COMPLICATING FACTORS THAT ARE THERE. I DON'T DISAGREE THAT THERE'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO BE DOING WHICH IS WHY YOU ASK ME WHAT WOULD I AGREE TO I WOULD AGREE TO ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE. POLICIES TRANSPARENT POLICIES AND THAT THAT THE PUBLIC CAN SEE WHAT THEY ARE SO THAT THE PUBLIC WE AS THE PUBLIC CAN MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HOW WE'RE INTERACTING. I DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR. US IS THE LEGISLATURE TO BE DICTATING YOU ARE NOW. A PUBLIC FORUM YOU'RE NOT A PUBLIC FORUM. THAT HAS TO BE AT THE END INTERACTION BECAUSE THE POSTERS ARE THE ONES WHO ARE ARE AND THEIR FREE SPEECH RIGHTS ARE IN FACT. PROTECTED HOURS IN FACT WE AS AS PUBLIC OFFICIALS. GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. WE CAN'T BLOCK. POSTERS WERE PEOPLE WE CAN'T BLOCK. THINGS THAT WE FIND OFFENSIVE EVEN IF THEY ARE TRULY OFFENSIVE. BECAUSE IF WE HAVE AN OFFICIAL SITE THAT CARRIES WITH IT THE EXPECTATION THAT WE ARE A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL AND ARE LIMITED THAN IN WHAT WE CAN DO. THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM SO THE USERS INDIVIDUALLY. INCLUDING ALL OF US AS GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. HAVE PARTICULAR RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES THAT ARE ABSENT FROM THE WITH THAT ARE DIFFERENT. ACTUALLY FROM THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM SOURCE TO IMPOSE UPON THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS THAT YOU ARE NOW A FIRST AMENDMENT PUBLIC FORUM I pTHAT'S WHY I COULD BE THE RECOMMENDATION THAT I DID. ALL RIGHT MISS GALLAGHER YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND LOOK AT I THINK THIS IS BEEN A GOOD DISCUSSION- I'LL I'LL JUST TAKE SOME PARTS FROM THE ANALYSIS THAT I THINK ARE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO THINK ABOUT RIGHT NOW UNDER TWO THIRTY IN THE ANALYSIS POINTS THIS OUT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ENJOY THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS. THURMOND FROM LIABILITY IF THEY ALLOW AN OF OBJECTIONABLE AND HARMFUL POSTING. AND THEIR IMMUNE FROM LIABILITY IF THEY REMOVE IT. SO RIGHT UNDER TWO THIRTY THERE'S REALLY YOU KNOW. WHAT I WANT TO DO AND I THINK WHAT MAYBE YOU HEAR A LOT OF CONSERVATIVES SAYING THAT HEY THERE SHOULD BE CENSORSHIP. THEY CAN'T DO RIGHT. AND THEN ON THE PROGRESSIVE LEFT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE AND WE WANT YOU TO DO MORE TO REGULATE DIFFERENT THINGS RIGHT. YOU CAN DO. THAT'S THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE LAW I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE OKAY. AND ALSO AS A GERMAN IS POINTED OUT THIS IS I THINK A OF GROSS INCONSISTENCY THAT RIGHT NOW YOU WITH YOUR GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT. IT WILL NOT IN YOUR GOVERNMENT OUT YOUR PERSONAL FACEBOOK THE YOU HAVE. YOU ARE LITERALLY NOT ALLOWED TO DELETE ANY COMMENTS. UNDER FIRST MET LAW BUT BUT THE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY COULD SHUT DOWN YOUR ENTIRE ACCOUNT THEY COULD BUT THEY COULD SHUT DOWN THE ENTIRE PLATFORM AND THAT WOULD BE COMPLETELY PERMISSIBLE. YEAH I MEAN THAT KIND OF INCONSISTENCY DOESN'T MAKE ANY KIND OF SENSE RIGHT WE EITHER ARE A PUBLIC FORM OR NOT AND I AND AS I'VE ARGUED I THINK WE VERY MUCH THESE PLATFORMS HAVE BECOME PUBLIC FORUMS AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE TO DO WE NEED TO DO TWO THINGS AND THAT'S- HENCE WHY THIS BILL HAS TWO PARTS. IS YOU NEED TO PROTECT FREE SPEECH. I WOULD THINK ABOUT THINK ABOUT IN THE SENSE OF THIS LEGISLATURE. IF SOMEONE WERE TO DETERMINE WILL LOOK. WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY. ME A REALLY DOESN'T MEET OUR CRITERIA I DON'T WANT YOU TO SPEAK ON THE FLOOR TODAY. AND SAY THAT. THAT'S THE KIND OF POWER THAT WE'VE LITERALLY GIVEN NOW. TO A SELECT GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT ACCOUNTABLE TO ANYBODY- THEY GET TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THAT SPEECH. MEETS THE CRITERIA. IN A IN A IN A PLACE WHERE IT REALLY HAS BECOME. VERY INFLUENTIAL ON WHAT PEOPLE THINK HOW PEOPLE VOTE. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY CAN REALLY DENY THAT THE TWITTER AND FACEBOOK HAVE REALLY BECOME THAT THAT PUBLIC FORM AND IF WE'RE GONNA LEAVE IT HOW IT IS. I THINK THAT'S PROBLEMATIC BUT LOOK THEY DON'T EVEN WANT YOU TO READ THEY DON'T EVEN WANT THIS IS ANOTHER INCONSISTENCY LIKE IF WE DON'T WANT TO MANDATE THAT THEY ARE SUBJECT TO THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND WEIGH IN IN THAT RESPECT. WHY THEN WE WEIGH IN ON WHAT POLICY THEY SHOULD HAVE. TO ME THAT WOULD BE KIND OF INCONSISTENT AS WELL. I'M TRYING TO GET IT BOTH AT BOTH ENDS OF THIS AND THAT'S- THAT'S WHY I THINK THIS BILL IS UNIQUE AND- YOU KNOW. IF YOU WERE TO TAKE THAT PART OUT I PROBABLY JUST WOULDN'T MOVE THE BILL FORWARD. AND WOULD WORK WITH OTHERS ON HEY WHAT'S THE BEST POLICY. BUT I REALLY THINK WE NEED TO DO BOTH BECAUSE OF THE STATUS A LOT RIGHT NOW IS NOT A GOOD ONE. AND I THINK WE ALL AGREE ON THAT. THANK YOU IN ORDER. FREESHEET YOUR AYE VOTE ON THE BILL. AS A WHOLE I KNOW THAT'S NOT THE MOTION ITSELF RIGHT NOW. BUT AS AS A WHOLE I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THE MOTION IS TO PASS WITH YOU MEMINTA STATED KALRA PLEASE. TO ARTS COMMITTEE.

THANK YOU MEMBERS I THINK THAT'S A FIRST FOR ME TO WORK VOTED AGAINST MY OWN BILL AND IT PASSED OUT OF COMMITTEE I THINK I'VE DONE THE FIRST YEAR THAT YOU KNOW AND NOT NECESSARILY THE FIRST I WANTED BUT- ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU GUYS APPRECIATE- THE CONSIDERATION RIGHT COMMITTEE NOW MOVES ITEM NUMBER FIVE AB EIGHT TWENTY NINE MR LEVINE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB EIGHT TWENTY NINE WILL IMPROVE SERVICES TO UNDOCUMENTED FOSTER YOUTH BY BETTER IDENTIFYING AND STANDARDIZING ACCESS TO IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICES FOR FOSTER YOUTH ACROSS THE STATE. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN I AUTHORED AB NINE HUNDRED. WHICH A LOT OF GUARDIAN TO BE APPOINTED TO UNDOCUMENTED YOUTH BY COURT IN CONNECTION. WITH THE PETITION REGARDING A FEDERAL SPECIAL IMMIGRANT JUVENILE STATUS APPLICATION DECIDUOUS. I SUGGEST WAS CREATED TO HELP ABUSED AND NEGLECTED. UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN. OBTAIN LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENCE IN UNITED STATES BUT IT'S DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN WITHOUT LEGAL REPRESENTATION. OR SUPPORT. AB EIGHT TWENTY NINE REQUIRES COUNTIES TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES REGARDING CURRENT PROCEDURES IN PLACE. TO SUPPORT UNDOCUMENTED MINOR AND NON MINOR DEPENDENTS IN FOSTER CARE. UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE JUVENILE COURT. AND THEIR PROCESSES TO PROVIDE THESE YOUTH WITH IMMIGRATION RESOURCES. EIGHTY EIGHT TWENTY NINE ALSO REQUIRES COUNTIES TO MAKE BEST EFFORTS TO PROVIDE AN UNDOCUMENTED MINOR OR NON MINOR DEPENDENT IN FOSTER CARE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE JUVENILE COURT WITH ACCESS TO IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICES. MEMBERS WE ALL WANT OUR FOSTER YOUTH TO BE SUCCESSFUL FOR UNDOCUMENTED FOSTER YOUTH THIS MEASURE IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS HELPING THEM OBTAIN. LAWFUL RESIDENCY PURSUE THEIR GOALS CONTRIBUTE TO THE FUTURE. OF CALIFORNIA AND QUITE FRANKLY JUST BECOME ADULTS- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR LEVINE I HAVE ONE WITNESS INDICATED IN SUPPORT KERRY WHITE OF THE CHILDREN'S LAWCENTER MS WHITE ARE YOU ON THE LINE. M. THANK YOU. MY NAME IS KERRY WHITE AND I AM AN IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY WITH CHILDREN'S LAW CENTER OF CALIFORNIA. CLT IS A NONPROFIT LEGAL SERVICES ORGANIZATION THAT SERVES AS THE VOICE OF THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM FOR DEPENDENT CHILDREN AND GIVE. OUR ATTORNEYS AND OTHER PROFESSIONALS STAFF REPRESENT OVER THIRTY THOUSAND ABUSED AND NEGLECTED CHILDREN IN THE LOS ANGELES SACRAMENTO AND PLASTER COUNTY FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. IN ADDITION TO APPEARING ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS AND DATED A DEPENDENCY PROCEEDINGS. GLC PROVIDES REPRESENTATION AND A HOST OF RELATED HEARING THAT SEEKS TO ENSURE THE WELL BEING AND FUTURE SUCCESS OF EACH CHILD. WE THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE FOR OFFERING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION WHICH WILL ENSURE THAT THERE ARE PROCESSES IN PLACE TO PROTECT UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN WHO ENTER THE DEPENDENCY SYSTEM ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FORMS OF IMMIGRATION RELIEF THAT WOULD PUT THEM ON A PATH TOWARDS OBTAINING LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENTS ALSO KNOWN AS THE GREEN CARD. NUMBERS RECOGNIZED THE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES AND VULNERABILITIES OF UNDOCUMENTED FOR THREE YEARS AND IN RESPONSE CREATED A SPECIFIC FORM OF IMMIGRATION RELIEF FOR THE FEW WHO ARE UNABLE TO REUNIFY WITH A PARENT. CALLED SPECIAL IMMIGRANT JUVENILE STATUS WHICH IS ITSELF A PATH TO LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENCE. UNDOCUMENTED LEAVE THE DEPENDENCY SYSTEM WITHOUT OBTAINING SPECIAL IMMIGRANT JUVENILE STATUS OR SOME OTHER FORM OF IMMIGRATION RELIEF WILL BE UNABLE TO LAWFULLY WORK OR TRANSITION SUCCESSFULLY TO ADULTHOOD. HOWEVER THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO REQUIREMENTS IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT THESE ISSUES ARE IDENTIFIED AND LINKED WITH IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDERS. TO ASSIST THEM IN OBTAINING THAT IMMIGRATION RELIEF. OTHER RESULT THE LEVEL OF ASSISTANCE TO YOU TO RECEIVE ON THEIR IMMIGRATION MATTER THEORY FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY. FOR EXAMPLE IN COUNTY SUCH AS SACRAMENTO OUR LAWYERS ARE TYPICALLY THE ONES SEARCHING FOR AN IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY OR NONPROFIT. TO REPRESENT CLIENTS IN COMPARISON AND WATCHING ENDLESS THE CHILD WELFARE AGENCY WORKS CLOSELY WITH OUR ATTORNEY. TO IDENTIFY LOCAL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND PRO BONO ATTORNEYS WILL PROVIDE IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICES FOR OUR CLIENTS. WE'VE ALSO HEARD OTHER ACCOUNTS OF OTHER COUNTIES WHERE NO IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICES ARE OBTAINED AND AS A RESULT YOU DO NOT RECEIVE THE IMMIGRATION RELIEF TO WHICH THEY ARE ENTITLED. AND EVENTUALLY LEAVE THE FOSTER CARE. SYSTEM WITHOUT IMMIGRATION STATUS. UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN IN THE DEPENDENCY SYSTEM ALL RIGHT FACE A NUMBER OF HURDLES SB FREQUENTLY ENTER THE SYSTEM OF LITTLE TO NO INFORMATION OR DOCUMENTATION ABOUT THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS. EVEN WHEN THEY'RE AND REMOVAL OR DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS. A. B. E. TWENTY NINE WILL REQUIRE THE COUNTY CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES HAVE A PROCESS IN PLACE TO IDENTIFY AND TRACK UNDOCUMENTED FOSTER YOUTH IN THEIR COUNTIES. IT WILL REQUIRE THAT THE AGENCIES MAKE BEST EFFORTS TO LINK THESE CHILDREN IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDERS. AND IF NECESSARY IDENTIFY ANY GAPS IN SERVICES AND SUPPORT. ALL OF THESE MEASURES ARE AIMED AT ENSURING THAT UNDOCUMENTED FOSTER YOUTH DO NOT FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS AND ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THE IMMIGRATION REMAINS. FOR WHICH THEY ARE SO FREQUENTLY ELIGIBLE WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. AND THEN- MISTER CHAIR I'D ALSO NOTE THAT OUR FORMER CLIENT INTENDED TO TESTIFY THIS MORNING IN SUPPORT AS WELL- UNFORTUNATELY HE HAD TO HEAD TO WORK HE ASKED ME TO SHARE HIS TESTIMONY WITH THE COMMITTEE- WITH THE CHURCH PERMISSION.

THANK YOU MISTER LEE WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. THAT MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS KALRA PLEASE STONE AYE STONE AYE GALLAGHER. CHAU HI CHAU AYE CHIU. DAVIES DAVIES I CONSOLIDATE THEMSELVES AYE HOLDEN HOLDEN AYE KALRA. KILEY MAIENSCHEIN REYES HI RES I. THE BILLS OUT THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU THIS MCCARTY ITEM NUMBER SIX AB. FOURTEEN SIXTY SIX. WE LOST EVERYBODY WITH. BUT YOU'RE HERE. YES CHAU GOES WAY BACK YEP THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN YOUR- GREAT- JUDICIARY STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US- ON THIS MEASURE- REALLY APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS AND BREAKING DOWN THE ISSUES- THE SIMPLE QUESTIONS IS SHOULD WE STILL HAVE THESE- RACIST COVENANTS IN THESE HOMES ACROSS CALIFORNIA THESE THESE VESTIGES OF. THE JIM CROW ERA AND WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO GET RID OF THEM- INDIVIDUALS WANT TO GET RID OF THEM ON THEIR OWN OR WITH THE HOUSE- CHANGES HANDS AS FAR AS A SALE SO THOSE ARE THE TWO ISSUES WERE TAKEN INTO TODAY AND SO AGAIN THIS GOES BACK TO THESE RACIALLY RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS WHICH AS WE KNOW THROUGHOUT HISTORY WERE PRIVATE AGREEMENTS. BARRING NON WHITES FOR OCCUPYING OR OWNING OWNING PROPERTY AND WERE A KEY ELEMENT SADLY OF OUR SEGREGATIONIST POLICIES OF THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY IN OUR COUNTRY AND RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND- RIGHT DOWN THE STREET WHEN I BOUGHT MY FIRST HOME MY REALTOR TOLD ME LOOK I KNOW THAT YOU ARE- BIRACIAL YOUR YOUR FAMILY FOLLOWS AFTER AMERICAN MONSTA CAJUN YOUR WIFE IN THE HOUSE MEXICAN AMERICAN YOU ARE TRULY A CALIFORNIA MULTIRACIAL FAMILY AND BURIED IN THESE COVENANTS ARE LANGUAGES SAYS THAT YOU CAN'T LEGALLY. BE IN THIS HOUSE AND JUST IGNORE THOSE YOU CAN BUY THIS HOUSE AND I WAS JUST FLOORED AND I THOUGHT ONE DAY THAT YOU KNOW WE SHOULD CHANGE THE LAW TO LITERALLY TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER HERE WE ARE TODAY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TALK ABOUT THIS AND- BUT CERTAINLY THESE- COVENANTS WERE STRIKEN BY THE SUPREME COURT THEY'RE NOT LEGALLY BINDING THEY CAN'T BE ENFORCED. BUT THERE ARE A REMINDER A CRUEL REMINDER AND SOMETIMES BRINGS ABOUT TRAUMA INDIVIDUALS AND SOME WOULD SAY WOULD THEY SHOULD THEY SHOULD REMAIN SO WE CAN LEARN ABOUT HISTORY WELL I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW SHOULD WE GO TO THE SCHOOLS THAT HAVE THE- WATER FOUND TO SAY WHITES ONLY- THE- MOVIE THEATERS NOW WE TOOK THOSE DOWN BECAUSE THERE WERE- NOT ONLY RACIST BUT THEY'RE INSENSITIVE AND THEY YOU KNOW THEY TRIGGERED. UNNECESSARY- THOUGHT IT'S FAR AS HOW. IS USED TO TREAT- PEOPLE. AND SO YEAH THIS WE ARE CURRENTLY HAVING A- WRECKING ACROSS OUR COUNTRY AS FAR AS- RACIAL JUSTICE AND OUR POLICIES OF THE PAST AND- AND SOME WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS. TRULY SYMBOLIC AND NOT REALLY GOING TO INCREASE HOME OWNERSHIP FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR WHEN HE'S GOING TO WORK ON THAT. BUT NONETHELESS THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT I THINK THAT. THAT WE SHOULD BE ADDRESSING SO AT THIS BILL THIS MEASURE BEFORE S. TAKES- TO PROACTIVE STEPS TO REMOVE RACIAL COVENANTS. FROM DEEDS- ONCE AND FOR ALL. IT WILL SIMPLIFY THE PROCESS FOR PROPERTY OWNERS TO DO ON THEIR OWN. GO INTO THEIR LOCAL OFFICIALS. AND WORK TO REMOVE THAT LANGUAGE AND REMOVE FEES AND MAKE IT A- A MORE STREAMLINED PROCESS. AND IT ALSO CREATES A- PROCESS WHEN A PROPERTY CHANGES HANDS. TO SEARCH SEARCH THROUGH THE DEEDS IDENTIFIED- POTENTIALLY RACIST LANGUAGE AND SUBSEQUENTLY HAVE IT REMOVED- THIS IS THE STICKING POINT WE ARE WORKING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS THERE ARE SOME. DIFFERENT OPINIONS AND HOW WE GO ABOUT GOING ABOUT THIS. WE'RE COMMITTED TO- FINE TUNING THIS PROCESS AND MAKING SURE THIS WORKS- FOR IT FOR EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA BY REMOVING. THESE THESE RACIST WORDS IS- IS MORALLY RIGHT. NOT JUST A JUST CAUSE BUT WORTH THE TIME AND EFFORT TO BRING ABOUT. RACIAL JUSTICE IN CALIFORNIA- I BELIEVE ONE OF MY WITNESSES MAY HAVE HAD TO- GO WITH THE LONG HEARING TODAY BUT- WE HAD- TO INDIVIDUALS ON THE LINE WHO WERE. WITH US- THIS MORNING. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL IN. NASCO THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. THANK YOU SO I HAVE. INDIVIDUALS LISTED HE DIDN'T IN SUPPORT THE SUPPORT WITNESSES IS JAMIE LEWIS AND THEN EITHER TO MICAH ROSS WERE CHEWING KORTCHMAR. WHO'S WHO'S STILL ON THE LINE WITH US. I CAN MAKE A MARKETS HERE ON THE LINE GO AHEAD PLEASE. WHAT THANK YOU SO MUCH AND GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN STONE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'D LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY PROVIDING ME TO SPEAK TODAY AND BRINGING FORWARD AB FOURTEEN SIXTY SIX. MY NAME IS TO MAKE A MARK AND I'M THE FOUNDER AND CEO ALL HOME ALL HOME IN THE BAY AREA ORGANIZATIONS THAT FIRST ADVANTAGE REGIONAL SOLUTIONS THAT DISRUPT THE CYCLE OF POVERTY AND HOMELESSNESS. ADDRESSES RACIAL DISPARITIES THAT HAVE LED TO BLACK AND BROWN AND INDIGENOUS FOLKS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AT A DISPROPORTIONATE RATE. AS WELL AS ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE WITH EXTREMELY LOW INCOME IN THE BAY AREA. I BELIEVE THAT AB FOURTEEN SIXTY SIX OF THEM IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE ALTHOUGH RACIAL COVENANTS IN PROPERTY DOCUMENTS ARE NO LONGER LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE. AT AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY TALKED ABOUT THEIR DISCRIMINATORY LEGACY CONTINUES TO REVERBERATE TODAY IN THE FORM OF DE FACTO SEGREGATION IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS THAT STILL MARGINALIZED ARE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. INTO HIGHER RATES OF POVERTY. AND JUST ABOUT EVERY OTHER FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE ECONOMIC AND PHYSICAL HEALTH IN OUR COMMUNITY. IT'S NO COINCIDENCE THAT THE REDLINING MAPS CREATED PUT. CREATED POPE- DEPRESSION IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHEN OVERLAID WITH PRESENT DAY MAPS OF HIGH RATES OF POVERTY POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES LOWER LIFE EXPECTANCY RATES AND EVEN HIGHER COLD INFECTION RATE. TURNED OUT TO BE BASICALLY IDENTICAL. WHEN THE HOME OWNERS LOAN CORPORATION GRADED MORTGAGE SECURITY A BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS AS WE SPEAK OR READ LINE YEARS OF SEGREGATION WILL REALLY CEMENTED INTO OUR PUBLIC POLICY. HISTORICALLY RACIST PRACTICE PRACTICES SUCH AS EXCLUSIONARY ZONING REDLINING AN EVEN WORSE STATE FEDERAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DECIDED TO BUILD FREE WEIGHT. THERE ARE COMMUNITIES TRULY CONTRIBUTED TO THE SEGREGATION AND INTERGENERATIONAL POVERTY. THAT WE SEE IN OUR COMMUNITIES TODAY. REYES AND ECONOMIC SEVEN PERSON AS WELL YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT RELATIVE TO THE ISSUE AND CRISIS OF HOMELESSNESS. HOW IT IS NO ACCIDENT THAT WE HAVE SO MANY OF OUR BLACK BROWN AND INDIGENOUS BROTHERS AND SISTERS EXPERIENCING THIS CRISIS DISPROPORTIONATELY REALLY BASED ON THESE COVENANTS THAT WERE BAKED IN AND THE SYSTEMIC RACISM THAT PROCESS. THE LAST THING I'D LIKE TO SAY IS YOU KNOW TODAY ONE IN FOUR BLACK AMERICANS ARE STUCK IN HIGH POVERTY NEIGHBORHOODS WE HAVE USED HOUSING AS THE WEALTH GENERATION GENERATOR. AND ASK THAT FOR SO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND THIS OPPORTUNITY HAS BEEN EXCLUDED FOR A BLACK BROWN AND INDIGENOUS NEIGHBORS SO THE PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND I'M JUST REALLY GRATEFUL THAT WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT IT WE'RE TAKING ACTION. AND IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE HOUSING JUSTICE WE HAVE TO ACHIEVE RACIAL JUSTICE AND SO I'M REALLY GRATEFUL TO BE WITH YOU ALL THIS MORNING AND HAPPY TO SPEAK ON BEHALF AND- OF THIS. LEGISLATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU N. OR JAMIE LEWIS OR TO ENCOURAGE MORE ON THE LINE. JANUARY FIFTH HERE PLEASE GO AHEAD. OKAY THANK YOU TEARS DOWN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB FOURTEEN SIXTY SIX MY NAME IS JAMIE LEWIS AND I'M A RESIDENT FAMILIES OBISPO I MOVED INTO THE IN HOME DISTRICT IN SAN LUIS OBISPO IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHILE PURCHASING MY HOME I WAS FILLING OUT A STACK OF PAPERWORK IN MY REALTOR SHARED WITH ME MY FUTURE HOME COVENANTS CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS. READING THROUGH THE THAT WAS APPALLED TO FIND A PROVISION PROHIBITING ANYONE OF A NON CAUCASIAN RACE FROM OCCUPYING OR OWNING THE HOME I KNEW I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS EASY IN OUR BUT I WASN'T SURE WHAT. THEN IN THE WAKE OF GEORGE FLOYD'S MURDER I HAD A MOMENT OF RECKONING WHERE IT BECAME ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT THE RACIST LANGUAGE IN MY THINKING IN OUR AND THE MURDER OF BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE AT THE HANDS OF POLICE ARE ALL PART IN AMERICA'S MULTI FACETED RACIST PAST AND PRESENT. THIS IS WHEN I BEGAN THE PROCESS OF HAVING THAT LANGUAGE REMOVED AND STARTED SPEAKING TO NEIGHBORS AND- THING THAT THESE CABINETS WERE PERVASIVE THROUGHOUT THE IN HOME DISTRICT DESPITE KNOWING THESE GOVERNMENTS ARE NO LONGER LEGAL OR ENFORCEABLE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO UNSEAT SOMETHING OUTWARDLY PREJUDICE. THE COMPOSITION OF MY NEIGHBORHOOD IS THE DIRECT PRODUCT OF THE CCN OURS IN FACT AND MORE BLACK MEN ARE INCARCERATED AT THE STATE PRISON HERE THEN RESIDE IN TOWN. FOURTEEN NEIGHBORHOODS AND I WERE ABLE TO GET THE LANGUAGE REMAINS ENGAGING AN UNCOMFORTABLE BUT NECESSARY CONVERSATIONS AROUND THE COMPOUNDING IMPACTS IN OURS HOW THEY BARRED BLACK FAMILIES FROM ACCESSING WEALTH APPRECIATED OVER GENERATIONS HOMEOWNERSHIP FOR ME REMOTE THE REMOVAL OF THE COVENANT IS A SMALL STEP IN ADDRESSING THE MUCH LARGER IMPACTS AT THIS DEMONSTRATE THEM HOWEVER IT IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN ELEVATING THE MUCH NEEDED CONVERSATION AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT A SYSTEMIC RACISM AND PRIVILEGE. AND IT COULD ELEVATE THAT CONVERSATION AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL OF CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION IN HOUSING UNITS BY 30% MARGIN THE PRESENCE OF THE CCN OURS UNDERSCORES HOW MUCH WORK STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE TO PROVIDE RACIAL EQUITY IN THE UNITED STATES AND FOR THAT REASON I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT OF EIGHTY FOURTEEN SIXTY SIX TO HELP CALIFORNIANS LIKE. MYSELF TO FIRST LEARN ABOUT AND COME TO TERMS THE LEGACY OF THE- GOVERNMENT. AND TO GET THE PLANE WHICH REMOVED ONE AND FOR ALL THANK YOU THANK YOU. RIGHT OPERATOR WHICH INTEL THE LINE FOR ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO US THEIR NAY AND THEIR- AND THAT THEY SUPPORT AB FOURTEEN SIXTY SIX. AND IF YOU WERE SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF AB FOURTEEN SIXTY SIX PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. YEP SOMEONE QUEUING UP ONE MOMENT PLEASE WHILE WE PROVIDE THEM THEIR LINE NUMBER. YOU. WE WILL OPEN FIFTY SEVEN ONE MOMENT PLEASE WHILE WE OPEN YOUR LINE. GO AHEAD PLEASE. IN THE MORNING AT MEDICARE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- THIS IS ANNA BACK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS- WE HAVE A SUPPORTING CONTACT ON THE BILL I'D REALLY LIKE TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER OR- BEING BEING WILLING TO WORK WITH THAT THIS SET INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUE- THE ONLY- THE ONLY ISSUE WE HAVE WITH THE BILL CURRENTLY IN ITS CURRENT FORM AS ITS POTENTIAL TO CAUSE TRANSACTIONAL DELAYS AND WE ARE. HOPEFUL TO WORK THAT OUT OVER THE PHONE WE HAVE YOUR IDOL TO CONTINUE MOVING BILL FOR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE HAVE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME OUR LINES IN Q. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU WILL NOW MOVED OPPOSITION I HAVE TO OPPOSITION WITNESSES MICHAEL LEVITT OF THE CALIFORNIA REPRESENT CALIFORNIA'S CLOSEST ASIAN AND CRAIG PAGE. CALIFORNIA LAND TITLE ASSOCIATION. MISTER CHAIRMAN HEARING YES. THIS IS YOUR THIS IS CRAIG PAGE- WITH WITH MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS CRAIG PAGE WITH EXACTLY THE KIND OF VICE PRESIDENT AND COUNSEL FOR THE CALIFORNIA LAND TITLE ASSOCIATION WE REPRESENT THE TITLE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA AND WALDRON LITERALLY MILLIONS OF HOME SALE TRANSACTIONS EACH YEAR. FIRST I WANT TO GIVE- COMPLEMENT THE CHAIR ON THE COMMITTEE STAFFER THE THOROUGHNESS OF THE ANALYSIS. OF AND THE EFFORTS AIMED AT THE UNDERTOOK TO TRY TO FIX THE BILL BEFORE ITS FIRST HEARING. THE ANALYSIS IS VERY THOROUGH AND POINTS TO A LOT OF COMPLEXITIES- THE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH WITH DEALING WITH WITH ILLEGAL RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS. NOW I WANT TO STATE UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT SEAL TEAM THE TITLE INSURANCE INDUSTRY STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE AUTHORS GOAL. OF ELIMINATING THESE OFFENSIVE ILLEGAL COMPANY RESTRICTIONS WHILE THEY AREN'T ENFORCEABLE THEIR HIGHLY OFFENSIVE IN THE INDUSTRY SUPPORTS. THAT GOAL THE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE LIKE WITH THE REALTORS. IS THAT WE HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT THE WAY OF TRAFFIC CURRENTLY WHICH WOULD PUT THE ONUS ON THE INTO THE ESCROW PROCESS FOR THESE THINGS TO BE. OF SADDAM OUT AND- AND REMOVED THROUGH THERE. THE- RCM PROCESS RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS PROCESS THE POINT OF SALE REQUIREMENTS CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW FOR MANY OF YOU'VE GONE THROUGH TIGHT- THROUGH A HOME SALE. YOU'LL KNOW THE PRELIMINARY REPORTS DRAFTED OUT OF THE TITLE AFTER THE- REALTOR OPENS THE- SALE IN IN THERE WILL BE A PRELIMINARY REPORT AND WE WILL HIGHLIGHT. THEY THE INSURANCE WERE OFFERING HIM THAN THOSE DOCUMENTS THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THE POLICY COVERAGE AND WE ALSO- MANY TIMES. PROVIDE THE CC IN OUR. THE COVENANTS CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS- THE REAL STAGE ARAMBULA THE BUYER OR LEE TO THOSE. ALL LINKS TO OTHER DOCUMENTS THAT AREN'T. COVERED UNDER THE OF THE COVERAGE- WE DO NOT READ THE- THE CCN OURS THEY DON'T AFFECT HOW WE ENSURE TITLED THE PROPERTY OFTENTIMES THE RESTRICTIONS ABOUT SETBACK REQUIREMENTS WITH YOU CAN PARK. NOT PARK WHICH WHICH YOU CAN DO WITH YOUR REAL PROPERTY. AND THEY'RE NOT SOMETHING THAT WE USE SO THE FIRST TIME THAT SOMEBODY READ THEM IS GOING TO BE THE REAL ESTATE AGENT AND THE PYRO MANY CASES. SO WE DON'T READ THROUGH THOSE DOCUMENTS NOR DO WE READ THROUGH ANTIQUATED. OLD THE THAT MAY BE IN THE CHAIN OF TITLE THAT GO BACK. YOU KNOW LITERALLY SEND SOME CASES BACK TO SPANISH MEXICAN LAND GRANTS. WE WILL WIN CALIFORNIA FINALLY CAME INTO STATEHOOD. THERE IS A EXTENSIVE RECORDS OF THERE'S A LOT OF ANTIQUATED DOCUMENTS THAT WE DO NOT GO BACK AND READ BECAUSE THEY'RE NO LONGER RELEVANT. IN SOME CASES YOU MAY FIND SOME OF THESE RACIAL COVENANTS WHICH ARE HIGHLY OFFENSIVE BURIED IN THE DOCUMENTS. OUT THERE WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE WE DON'T LOOK FOR THEM WE DON'T HIGHLIGHT THEM FOR CONSUMERS. SO TO PUT IT INTO A INTO A- ESCROW PROCESS WITH WE THINK IT WILL TAKE WEEKS IF NOT LONGER AND ALSO WILL DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE PRICE THE COST OF THE- OF THE TITLE INSURANCE AND ESCROW PROCESS. BECAUSE REMEMBER THESE ARE NOT JUST RACIAL KEVIN IS THE OLDEST ILLEGAL COVENANTS RESTRICTIONS THAT ARE THAT ARE COVERED IN THE BILL. THE WORLD FOCUSING MOSTLY ON. THE RACIAL COVENANTS BECAUSE THE MOST OFFENSIVE. BUT WE WOULD NEED TO A LEGAL. THE READ THROUGH ALL THOSE DOCUMENTS WHICH ARE ACTUALLY LITERALLY. CAN'T RECORD DOCUMENTS PAPER DOCUMENTS THAT ARE SCANNED INTO A DIG INTO A- COMPUTER IT IS NOT A DATABASE WE CANNOT DO- KEYWORD SEARCHES WE CANNOT LOOK. THROUGH DOCUMENTS LIKE THAT WE'D HAVE TO PULL THE BUCK ONE BY ONE. AND READ DOWN THROUGH THE MANY OF THEM HAND WRITTEN DOCUMENTS BACK TO THE EARLY. LATE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS AND EARLY NINETEEN. SO IT'S NOT A PROCESS THAT'S EASY IT CAN BE VERY TIME CONSUMING AND COSTLY. AND SEAL TA HAS WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE AUTHOR AND WITH THE COMMITTEE IF YOU LOOK AT OUR AMENDMENTS THAT WE PROVIDED WE'RE LOOKING AT A MORE GLOBAL APPROACH. THAT TAKES IT OUT OF ESCROW SO THE CONSUMERS DO NOT FACE THIS THESE COSTS AND DO NOT FACE THESE DELAYS. AND WOULD ALLOW EACH C. D. AND OTHERS WE WERE NAY WE'RE GONNA NEED TO GENERATE MONEY TO. TO LOOK FOR THESE THINGS IT'S GOING TO BE COSTLY TO DO IT. AND THEN OUR PROPOSAL THAT THE PAST YOUR LETTER. WE PROVIDE A MINIMAL RECORDING FEE THAT WOULD BE. SPREAD ACROSS ALL ALL TRANSACTIONS SO THAT WE COULD GENERATE REVENUE FOR H. D. D. AND A LARGER GROUP TO. SEARCH FOR THESE THINGS ONE OF THE EARLIER- OF THE EARLIER TESTIMONY TALK ABOUT HOW THE AS A AS A AS HOMEOWNERS WHEN OUTLOOK FOR THE THESE THINGS WHAT WE LIKE TO DO THAN GAUGE. ACD IN A LARGE GROUP OF FOLKS TO GO OUT AND LOOK AT THE END AND TO TRY TO TARGET THESE THINGS IN MATH. DO A SUBDIVISION AT A TIME WILL GO OUT AND TRY TO FIND A WAY FOR US TO DO USED. IN MASS SO THAT WE'RE NOT DOING THEM ONCE ONE OF THE TIME IN A REALISTIC TRANCE. AND I THINK ONE THING THE HIGHLIGHT BEFORE I CLOSED- MISTER CHAIRMAN ON THIS. IS THAT. PEOPLE OF COLOR BOTH A REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS UNDER THIS NEW LAW. WOULD BE FACING HIGHER COSTS AND FEES. IN THEIR OWN REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS. WHEN WE RATHER TAKE IT OUTSIDE THE PROCESS. DO IT ALL ONCE AND THEN ANY CREATE A PROCESS WHERE THERE'S A MIRROR IMAGE DOCUMENT. WITH THESE THINGS ARE ACTUALLY STRUCK AND THEN THE CONSUMER NEVER RECEIVE THEM. BECAUSE THE FORWARD FACING DOCUMENT THAT'S PUT INTO THE PUBLIC RECORD. NO LONGER HAS THIS OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE WE LIKE TO WORK AS A PARTNER. WITH THE AUTHOR AND WITH OTHER GROUPS AND GOVERNMENTS YOU TO TRY TO. FORGET THESE THINGS ONCE AND FOR ALL- BUT WE THINK THROUGH THE ESCROW PROCESS WITH THE DELAYS AND INCREASED COSTS. IS THE WRONG WAY TO APPROACH THIS. THANK MAKE YOUR. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- MIGHT BELOW TO SPEAKING FOR THE CALIFORNIA ESCROW ASSOCIATION- IT'S THE FIRST SECONDING- MR PAGE'S COMMENTS BUT- IN GENERAL MR MCCARTY HAS IDENTIFIED AND IS WORKING ON A COMPELLING ISSUE AND I THINK THE ANALYSIS DID A GREAT JOB OF ARTICULATING THE COMPLEXITY OF IT SOME PEOPLE RELATED PERSONAL ANECDOTES AND I HAVE ONE. OF THE FIRST HOUS I PURCHASED WAS IN THE LAND PARK PRETTY DESIRABLE AREA OF SACRAMENTO AND SPEND SOMEBODY GAVE ME AN AD WHEN THEY WERE SELLING LOTS AND LAND PARK IN NINETEEN FORTY THAT VERY PROMINENT ON THE AD WHERE THE WORDS HEAVILY RESTRICTED WHICH WAS OBVIOUSLY CODE FOR RACIAL COVENANTS. SO IN NINETEEN FORTY NOT ONLY WAS THIS NOT AN UGLY STAIN AS REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS IT WAS THE ACTUAL SALES FEATURE THAT'S HOW EMBEDDED RACISM HAS BEEN IN THE REAL PROPERTY SYSTEM SO THE ISSUE IS COMPELLING WHAT IT WHAT IS THE BEEN THE STRUGGLE FOR NOW FORTY YEARS I WAS FIRST INVOLVED IN A BILL IN THE MID NINETEEN EIGHTIES ON THIS SUBJECT IS HOW TO EFFICIENTLY- FIND THESE COVENANTS WHICH WERE PROBABLY. RECORDED SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE EIGHTEEN EIGHTIES AND ABOUT NINETEEN FIFTY AND GET THEM REMOVED- I DON'T BELIEVE THAT- DELEGATING THIS TO TITLE INSURERS- WHO WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK AND GO THROUGH THE PROCESS THAT MR PAGE OUTLINE IS QUITE THE RIGHT ANSWER AND WE YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR DECADES WERE WE'D LOVE TO SEE THIS RESOLVED IT IS AS MR CLARK NOTED AN UGLY STAIN. ON OUR SOCIETY AND- WE PLEDGE TO WORK WITH MR MCCARTY AND YOUR COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE IN RESOLVING IT BUT I DON'T THINK DELEGATING IT TO TITLE INSURERS. IS QUITE THE RIGHT ANSWER THANK YOU THANK YOU. OPERATOR WOULD YOU OPEN UP THE LINES ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO GIVE US THEIR NAME THEIR AFFILIATION. AND THAT THEY'RE OPPOSED TO AB. FOURTEEN SIXTY SIX. AND THIS IS IN OPPOSITION SIR ONCE AGAIN YES. OKAY THANK YOU AND IF YOU'RE SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. MISTER CHAIRMAN WE HAVE NO IN QUEUING UP AT THIS TIME. I THANK YOU I'M GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. THIS MCCARTY WHEN I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS QUITE A BIT. AND I THINK THE FRUSTRATING THING IS MR BELOW ALLUDED TO THIS HAS BEEN. SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT FOR OVER FORTY YEARS FORTY YEARS WE'VE KNOWN THIS PROBLEM AND THAT THE ISSUE ULTIMATELY IS WHATEVER GETS PROPOSED THERE SOMEBODY WHO SAYS- WE AGREED BUT NOT US NOT US NOT US NOT US. PERHAPS IT IS BETTER TO DO A GLOBAL CHANGE AND WHAT WE'VE COME UP WITH IN THIS BILL AND WHAT I'M ECOMMENDING AN AYE VOTE ON IS A MECHANISM TO HAVE IT HAPPEN IS IF WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO FUNDS AND PERHAPS IN THE IN THE ANALYSIS RACES THIS ISN'T IT ABOUT TIME. THAT THE GOVERNMENT FIX THE PROBLEM THE GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY SOLVED OR CREATED OVER THE YEARS YEAH THAT'S THAT'S VERY TRUE. BUT WHAT'S THE APPROPRIATE MECHANISM. AND I THINK THIS IS A BILL THAT PROPOSES A MECHANISM A VALID MECHANISM ANYTHING THAT GETS PROPOSED IS GOING TO HAVE SOME GROUP IN OPPOSITION. BUT THERE COMES A TIME WHEN WE JUST NEED TO PUT. SOMETHING ON THE TABLE THAT. THAT GETS THIS ACCOMPLISHED AND GETS IT ACCOMPLISHED IN AN EXPEDITIOUS MANNER. I THINK I WOULD RATHER SEE US INVEST IN JUST HAVE IT DONE GLOBALLY THAT'S PROBABLY THE BEST IN THE AND THE QUICKEST WAY TO GET IT DONE. BUT AGAIN THAT BRINGS OPPOSITION AND WHETHER OR NOT WE'D BE ABLE TO FUND THAT IS A QUESTION. SO THIS BILL RIGHT NOW IS PROPOSING TRANSACTION BY TRANSACTION BASIS WHICH WILL PROLONG THE SOLUTION BUT AT LEAST IT IS. IF WE CAN PUT THIS IN PLACE SOMETHING THAT WILL GET. WILL WILL MOVE US TOWARDS ACCOMPLISHING A SOLUTION HERE SO THAT'S WHY IT'S PROPOSED THE WAY IT IS. BUT FOR ME FRANKLY. I'M A BIT AGNOSTIC AS TO WHAT GETS. WHAT THE MECHANISM IS AS LONG AS IT GETS DONE AND WE CAN GET IT DONE AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN AND WE STOP THIS DECADES OF- WE WANT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT WE JUST CAN'T BECAUSE THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY WE CAN ALWAYS SAY THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY AND THAT JUST MEANS IT WILL NEVER GET DONE. SO I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS UP MISSED MCCARTY AND I AM VERY HOPEFUL THAT THIS COMMITTEE IS GOING TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD I KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO WHEN YOU'RE COMMITTED THAT AND I APPRECIATE THAT THAT COMMITMENT THIS IS. THIS IS. AN EX. EXCELLENT BECAUSE- RIGHT OTHER MISTER GALLAGHER. YES- APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR AND CERTAINLY THESE RESTRICTIONS ARE REPREHENSIBLE- AND I THINK REPRESENT THE WORST OF OUR HISTORY- AND NO DOUBT PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN. THE RELATIVE WEALTH AND HOMEOWNERSHIP OF AFRICAN AMERICANS. AND LATINOS- SO I TOTALLY SYMPATHIZE WITH WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO HERE- TO THE POINT OF THE OPPOSITION. IS THERE A BETTER WAY TO DO THIS I MEAN IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE PROPOSING MAY BE OTHER WAYS THAT LIKE I KIND OF HEARD THAT THE MERE MERE IMAGE- RECORDINGS OR- OTHER WAYS OF DOING THIS IT. OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE SAYING THERE'S THEY'RE OPEN TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE BUT MAYBE NOT MAKING IT PART OF THE ESCROW PROCESS- AND THIS WAY WHICH I THINK COULD END UP BEING. MORE EXPENSIVE AND DRAG OUT S. GROWS LONGER WHICH IS. WE NOT WE WANT TO DO- IN TERMS OF ENCOURAGING HOMEOWNERSHIP AND THOSE TYPES OF THINGS BUT. I GET THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS I MEAN THE OTHER PROBLEM IS EVEN IF YOU DO A RECORDING IT DOESN'T REALLY NECESSARILY GET RID OF THAT RECORDING RIGHT IS JUST ANOTHER RECORDING THAT. KIND OF. ON PAPER EXTINGUISHES IT BUT IT'S STILL. BUT IT'S STILL A RECORDED DOCUMENT THAT'S ON TITLE RIGHT. SO MAYBE I MEAN I JUST MAYBE JUST FOR YOUR RESPONSE LIKE HOW DO WE- DO THINK THAT THERE'S ANOTHER WAY OF ADDRESSING THIS ARE YOU OPEN TO WHAT THE OPPOSITION IS SAYING IN TERMS OF AN ALTERNATIVE- AND THEN EXPLAINED DOES I DON'T MY UNDERSTAND IS IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY GET RID OF THE- OF THE OFFENSIVE CC IN OUR- LIKE BECAUSE THAT'S ALREADY RECORDED ON. TITLE LIKE YOU'RE YOU'RE JUST RECORDING ANOTHER DOCUMENT TODAY. THAT ESSENTIALLY LIKE A MEN'S OR CHANGES THAT RIGHT. WITH YEAH HE'S OUT FOR A SPOT YOU CAN YEAH LEVINE I CAN'T REALLY NOT WITH THE MASSES YOU CAN'T SEE. IS THAT WE ASK YOU A SERIES OF QUESTIONS THERE- SO YEAH I THINK IT WOULD BE EASIEST IF WE JUST HAD A GLOBAL FAX BUT THE ESTIMATES ARE BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN A BILLION DOLLARS AND WOULD YOU RATHER SPEND A BILLION DOLLARS TO CHANGE THESE ARE TO IMPROVE HOMEOWNERSHIP. FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR ACROSS CALIFORNIA I THINK THAT WE GOT TO DEBATE TO HAVE- THE OTHER THING IS BY DOING THIS THAT'S LIKE YEARS AGO WE WANTED TO CHANGE THE TOILETS FOR THE LOW FLUSH TOILETS NO IDEA WHAT TO DO I'M AT THE POINT OF SALE WELL WOULD TAKE THIRTY YEARS FOR EVERY PROPERTY TO FLIP OVER BEFORE YOU GOT TO EVERYBODY ITSELF. THIS DOESN'T GET TO EVERYBODY RIGHT AWAY POLICE IT STARTS ON A CONTINUAL BASIS LIKE WHEN I BOUGHT MY HOME MISTER BELOW ABOUT HIS SONG IN SOUTHWEST PARK AND OTHERS AND SO- I THINK WE ALL INCLUDING YOU AND THE PEOPLE TESTIFIED REALIZE THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM AS THE CHAIR NOTED WE'VE BEEN BACK AND FORTH FOR DECADES ON THIS GOVERNOR SORTS **** VETOED ON ALMOST IDENTICAL BILL. THAT THE LAND TITLE ASSOCIATION HAD A BURDEN ON THEM AND THEY OPPOSED ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO I THINK WE'RE TAKING A NEW LOOK AT THIS ANYWAY IN SOCIETY LOOKING AT THAT WHAT THESE COVENANTS MEANING AND HAVE THE LASTING IMPACT THEY'VE THEY'VE HAD. TO GENERATIONAL WEALTH- TEAM LED BY BY PEOPLE WHO ARE SCARED INTO NEIGHBORHOODS THAT DIDN'T HAVE THE LAND PARK TYPE OF PRE APPRECIATION HERE IN SACRAMENTO SO I'M I'M WORKING WITH THE YEAH WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH A REALTOR IS THAT. THE LAND TITLE ASSOCIATION THE ESCROW FOLKS TO- TO WORK AS A GOOD FOR THE PROCESSES YOU KNOW WILL HAVE MANY OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH DIFFERENT COMMITTEE SENT I THINK THE WELL TO DO IT IS THERE AND WE NEED JUST TO HAVE THE DESIRE. TO FINALLY DO THIS. RIGHT AND I DO KNOW THAT LIKE RIGHT NOW ANYBODY CAN GO AND RECORD WHAT'S CALLED A RESTRICTIVE COVENANT MODIFICATION CORRECT TO DATE WITH THAT THAT'S THE SECOND THE BILL HAS TWO PARTS OF THE SECOND WITNESS WE HAD WAS JUST THAT SHE WAS- SHE WANTED THAT SHE STARTED AT A CLUB IN HER NEIGHBORHOOD OF CLUB AN ORGANIZATION IN SAN LUIS OBISPO. INTIMATE DOCUMENTARY MOVIE ABOUT THIS AND THEY WENT AROUND AND GOT NEIGHBORS THEY HAD A BIG PARTY IN THE BLOCK BROUGHT OUT THE FORMS IN THE PAPER AND ITS REALLY BURDENSOME AND LET'S SAY YOU'RE HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND SOMEONE AND YOU ALL ACROSS THE RIVER AS A DIFFERENT PROCESS SO WE WANT TO DO FOR THAT IS MAKE IT STREAMLINED SO ALL COUNTIES HAD THE SAME KIND OF PROCESS AND WE WANT TO. REMOVE THE BURDEN SO WE WORKED WITH THAT THE CLERK RECORDS ASSOCIATIONS THEY'RE GOING TO REMOVE THE FEES CHARGED THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE IT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET IT AT A NOTARIZED TO REAP REMOVES THE BARRIERS SO PEOPLE LIKE US WHO EVER CAN DO IT ON THEIR OWN SO THAT'S A GIVEN BUT- THE OTHER PIECE IS WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT AND AS THESE PROPERTIES AS THE- AS THE SOMEONE. TESTIFY IN MILLION COUPLE MILLION PROPERTIES A YEAR CHANGE HANDS. IT WOULD BE EASIER TO AS THOSE CHANGE HANDS TO CHANGE. THAT THAT THAT RACIALLY HANDS THE LANGUAGE. IN THOSE RECORDINGS. AND YEAH I CAN CURRENT ALIKE WHEN WE TO READ A BILL THAT'S BEEN AMENDED. YOU STRIKE THROUGH THE OTHER LANGUAGE AND YOU KNOW THE GOAL IS TO REMOVE THAT SO IT'S NOT THERE FOR PEOPLE TO. TO SEE IN THE FIRST PLACE. RIGHT BUT I THINK WHAT OPPOSITION IS SAYING IS THAN THAT. THEY DON'T KNOW EITHER. NECESSARILY RIGHT THEY HAVE TO GO AND DO THE SEARCH TO. FIND IF THERE'S ANY OF THESE TYPES OF DOCUMENTS IN THERE. THAT'S GOING TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF TIME. AND COST OF THE ACTUAL MEAL HOME SALE TRANSACTION. THAT'S RIGHT I MEAN I KIND OF THING LIKE IS IT BETTER TO CERTAINLY THE SECOND PART OF YOUR BILL I THINK MAKES A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE LIKE GIVE MAKING UNIFORMS THE PEOPLE CAN DO THIS ACROSS THE BOARD. BUT I'M STRUGGLING A LITTLE BIT WITH LIKE MAKING THAT PART OF. THE ESCROW MAYBE OPPOSITION WHAT WOULD BE THE ALTERNATIVE. THAT YOU GUYS ARE PROPOSING. THERE WAS A QUESTION FOR OPPOSITION. IF THEY'RE NOT THERE I CAN SUMMARIZE WHAT THEY'VE LAID OUT MISTER SMITH WELL IT IT GO AHEAD CORRECT THIS IS CREEK PAYS OF THE CALIFORNIA LAND TITLE ASSOCIATION THE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE IS TO CREATE ESSENTIALLY A MERE DOCUMENTS AS AS HIGHLIGHTED BY. A SMALL GALLAGHER THERE'S CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW THE RACIAL THE RESTRICTIVE COVENANT MODIFICATION PROCESS IS NOT WORKING WHEN WE WERE IN DIALOGUE WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE AND THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. SERVER COMMITTEE FOR WENT OUT AND FOUND SOME OF THESE RCM DOCUMENTS THERE'S ONE CASE THEY HAD TAKEN THE DOCUMENT XEROX THAT GREW DRAWN A LINE THROUGH THE OFFENSIVE- LANGUAGE AND THEN RE RECORDED THAT DOCUMENT SO IF YOU GO BACK AND LOOK FOR THE RCM OF THE RESTRICTIVE CALL KEVIN MODIFICATION. YOU ACTUALLY STILL SEE THE LANGUAGE SO NOTHING WAS ACCOMPLISHED ANOTHER SITUATION ANOTHER A PERSON HAD RECORDER THE RESTRICTIVE COVENANT MODIFICATION DOCUMENT AND SAID THAT THIS DOCUMENT IS TO BE RECORDED ABSENT THIS LANGUAGE SO THEY REPUBLISH THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS OFFENSIVE IT WAS IN THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE DOCUMENT THAT WAS ATTACHED IT WAS IN THE NEW VERSION OF THE DOCUMENT ATTACHED. TO ALL THE DETAILS REALLY CAN REPUBLISH THE OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE SO THE RESTRICTIVE COVENANT MODIFICATION APPROACH RIGHT NOW IS JUST NOT WORKING IN MANY CASES PEOPLE MAY THINK THEY'RE ACCOMPLISHING WHAT THEY WHAT THEY WANT WITH THE LOSS OF SOUTH OF THERE BUT THEY'RE NOT. AND WITH THE PROCESS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR PROPOSAL THERE WOULD BE A MIRROR IMAGE DOCUMENT SO YOU WOULD LIKE THE TRUNCATION RIGHT NOW THERE'S A TRUNCATED SOCIAL SECURITY- OF- PROVISIONAL LAW WE'RE WE HAVE TAKEN DOCUMENTS CREATED MERE IMAGES SO THE PUBLIC FACING DOCUMENT HAS A TRUNCATED SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER IN THIS CASE THE PUBLIC FACING. ARE SO RESTRICTIVE COVENANT MODIFICATION DOCUMENTS WOULD BE MINUS THAT LANGUAGE SO WHEN PEOPLE GO INTO ESCROW TITLE COMPANIES WOULD CATCH IT IS THIS IS THIS PROCESS HAPPENS AND I THINK THAT THAT'S THAT'S WERE HOPING FOR AND WE'D LIKE TO DO IT YOU KNOW SUBDIVISIONS. AT A TIME OR OF HOAS OF THE TIME OR DO IT LIKE NAY. AND BUT THE THRILLER PROCESS OF. ANOTHER CONCERN THAT I HAVE TO IS RIGHT NOW THE PROCESS UNDER CURRENT LAW REQUIRES THAT THE- COUNTY COUNCIL REVIEW EACH ONE OF THIS. IF THIS IN FACT. INCREASES SUBSTANTIALLY THERE NEEDS TO BE MONEY PROVIDED TO THOSE COUNTY COUNCIL TO REFUSE TO REVIEW THESE DOCUMENTS. AND GIVE THEIR STAMP OF APPROVAL- IF OF A LOT OF THESE ARE HAPPENING COUNTY RECOUNT ACCOUNT ACCOUNTS ARE GONNA BE OVERWHELMED. WITH THE REQUIREMENTS REVIEW THESE IN OUR PROPOSAL WITH THE RECORDING FEE- WE HELP TO FUND THAT. SO THAT'S KIND OF ARE CONCERNED AS WELL. THIS HOLD. FIGURES SHARE I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD I CONCUR WITH THE CHAIRS. ASSESSMENT OF THE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP AND THAT YOU KNOW THE BILL NEEDS TO MOVE FORWARD- I THINK THAT YOU ALREADY INDICATED AS THE AUTHOR A WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO SORT OF FINE TUNE SOME OF THE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED. AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT TO HAPPEN BECAUSE I THINK THAT. THERE ARE SOME MAYBE IMPLEMENTATION ELEMENTS OF THIS MOVE MIGHT HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SO THERE'S- THE OPPORTUNITY TO IRON THAT OUT AS YOU GO FORWARD BUT I THINK THAT. WHAT YOU'RE ATTEMPTING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE IN IS NOT WORTHY AND- I WOULD BE HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION THAT IS THEIR SECOND. AND THE SECOND THANK YOU MISS DAVIS THANK YOU- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THIS TYPE OF LANGUAGE IS LANGUAGE NEEDS TO BE REMOVED. MY CONCERN AGAIN IS WITH THEM YOU MAKE GOOD POLICY YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S BENEFICIAL ON BOTH SIDES SO THAT THERE AREN'T REPLICATIONS OF THE GONNA COME BACK AT THE END. LET ME TO LOOK AT- MONETARILY YOU KNOW THE COST THAT IT COULD BE THE DELAY OF GETTING ESCROW AND THEN IF THIS COST COULD ACTUALLY BE PUT ONTO THE- BUYER OR THE HOMEOWNER- AGAIN WE'RE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH HOUSING AND THE COST OF HOUSING. I JUST WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE A BETTER WAY THAT WE COULD STREAMLINE THIS AND MAKE IT FASTER AND NOT- TAKE UP YOU KNOW MAKE IT BURDEN AGAIN WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE COUNTY IS HE SAID. WE DON'T YOU KNOW COUNTIES- ARE INUNDATED RIGHT NOW SPECIALLY COATED IN HAVING INFORMATION LIKE THIS BROUGHT ABOUT AND HE TO HAVE ANYTHING HELD UP- AND THEN HAVING CONCERNED THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE STAFFING SO. I WOULD LOVE YOU TO WORK WITH THE- OPPOSITION TO SEE HOW WE CAN MAINSTREAM THIS AND. SO THAT'S BENEFICIAL BOTH SIDES THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS. COMMENTS THIS RARE. I JUST APPRECIATE THE CHAIR'S COMMENTS HE SAID WE'RE GOING TO PASS THIS OR WE SHOULD PASS THIS DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE- IT HAS TO BE CHANGED HAS TO BE CORRECTED. AND YOU HAVE CLEARLY. THAT YOU'RE SAYING THIS IS IT AND IS THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE SAYING. WE'LL FIND THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS. YOU COULD YOU. REITERATED YOUR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION THE OPPOSITION HAS CONFIRMED THAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH THEM SO I REALLY APPRECIATE TO MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD SO THAT. YOU CAN CONTINUE YOUR DISCUSSIONS AND COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT THAT WE ALL ARE GOING TO BE SUPPORTING ON THE FLOOR THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ALTHOUGH THE FRUSTRATION AND WE TALKED ABOUT THIS IS EVERY TIME WE TRY THIS SOMEBODY'S OPPOSE. AND YES IT PROBABLY WOULD BE BETTER TO TRY TO DO THIS ON A GLOBAL BASIS IF WE CAN PULL THAT OFF THAT WOULD BE GREAT. WHY THIS WORKS IS ULTIMATELY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THROUGH THE ESCROW PROCESS BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT CAN'T BE DONE BEFORE. SO THAT WOULDN'T DELAY YES CHRIS WHO WAS SELLER WANTS TO SELL THE HOUSE I WOULD HOPE. THAT THE REALTOR WOULD BE TELLING THIS IS A STEP THAT NEEDS. TO BE TAKEN AND THAT CAN THEN BE DONE. BEFOREHAND SO THAT IT'S- SLOWING DOWN. THE S. PROCESS THERE ARE NO. OF DIFFERENT THAT CAN. THAT'S WHY THE IS A- AND- BUT WHICH HAS. WE NEED TO THIS ALL. AND NOT KEEP THIS FORTY. FIFTY SIXTY. THEY WERE OVER TO SOLVE THE- BUT- NEXT YEAR. THAT HAS TO END AND THAT'S WHY I'M HOPING THIS WILL. MOVE AND YOU'LL BE ABLE SOLVE THIS MYSTERY MCCARTY THANK YOU AND WITH THAT. PLEASE CLOSE. YET THANK YOU I. TWO THE THIRTEENTH THIS WE HAVE A LIFETIME THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS SO WE HAVE PLENTY F OPPORTUNITY TO FIND. A BETTER WHAT BETTER WAY I DON'T SEE THAT THAT THAT THE PERFECT WAY RIGHT NOW WE WORKED WITH YOU AND YOUR- TEAM ESTHER CLARK AND A GREAT JOB HELPING US. COME UP WITH A- I THINK A PATH FOR TODAY BUT YOU KNOW. THERE'S A WILL TO CHANGE THIS AND BUT SOMEBODY HAS TO DO THE WORK AND SO- I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S GONNA BE BORN ON PEOPLE TRYING TO BUY A HOME AND HOME AND HOMES ARE UNAFFORDABLE IT'S JUST SELLER AS YOU KNOW WHEN THERE'S A SCRIPT OUT SINCE IS THE PERSON WHO'S- SELLING THE HOME AND- MAKING SOMETHING OFFER THAT SELL OF COURSE. WE DON'T A BIRD ANYBODY I THINK IT'S A SUPPORT REMINDER THERE IS NOT THE COST. ON THE BUYER IT'S ON THE SELLER- BUT- YOU KNOW IF THERE IS A MORE SIMPLIFIED BETTER WAY. TO GET TO GET THE MOST AMOUNT OF THESE RACIST. WORDS STRICKEN OFF THE UP OFF THESE- PROPERTIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S A THAT'S A WE'RE TRYING TO DO. AND SOCKET IN YOU TO WORK WITH WITH EVERYBODY AND- I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION. AND WITHOUT ASKING RIVAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND AND TE MOTION IS TO PASS.

THANK YOU THE BILLS OUT THANK YOU ALL RIGHT MISTER KALRA AJ ARE ONE ALL RIGHT OF NUMBER EIGHT. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. FIRST I WANT TO COMMEND- THE THRONE AUS BY THE COMMITTEE FOR THOSE NUMBERS THAT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY- TO LOOK THROUGH THE ANALYSIS YOU'LL FIND WELL DOCUMENT JUSTIFICATIONS FOR AG ARE ONE INCLUDING ISIS INHUMANE AND LEGAL METHODS ISIS CONSISTENT CONTROVERSY THROUGHOUT DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATIONS ICE'S ROLE IN FAMILY SEPARATION ICE'S INABILITY TO PROVIDE IMMIGRANTS BASIC HEALTH CARE. I SEVERELY- DURING THE PANDEMIC ICE'S IN HUMANA SUBSTANDARD ATTENTIONS ICE'S ROLE IN TERRORIZING IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND I SAYS BUDGET MISMANAGEMENT AND ON ACCOUNTABILITY. GIVEN THESE JUSTIFICATIONS AND MORE IS COMPLETELY APPROPRIATE FOR CALIFORNIA SAY ICE IS BEYOND REFORM AND NEEDS TO BE ABOLISHED. SPECIFICALLY HR ONE OF ICE AND CALLS FOR THE ORDERLY AND JUST TRANSFER A LEGALLY REQUIRED ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS INA MANNER THAT UPHOLDS VALUES A DUE PROCESS. THE QUALITY AND THE LAW AND FAMILY UNITY. CALLING FOR ICE TO BE ABOLISHED AS A MESSAGE ALIGNS WITH THE MAJORITY OF NATIONAL OPINION ONE SURVEY RELEASED TWENTY NINETEEN. FOR THAT 54% OF ADULTS HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE VIEW OF ICE. MAKING THE LEAST LIKED OF SIXTEEN MAJOR FEDERAL AGENCIES AND THAT NUMBER IS EVEN. HIGHER IN CALIFORNIA. IT IS ALSO PROBABLY THE CALIFORNIA STAND WITH THEIR DIVERSE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. WHO HAVE BEEN AND ARE STILL SUBJUGATED ISIS EXTREME AGENDA. IN CALLING FOR ICE TO BE ABOLISHED IN HR THEY'RE ALSO CONVENE TO FEDERAL LEADERS THAT ICE'S ROLE IN TERRORIZING IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. IS ON WELCOMED AND HAS NOTHING TO ENHANCE PUBLIC SAFETY. IT IS MY STRONG BELIEF ON THAT IS SHARED WITH MANY WITH LIVED EXPERIENCES. OF ICE IS DEHUMANIZING AND ABUSE ABUSIVE TACTICS. THE ICE OPERATES AS A ROGUE AGENCY IN FACT EVEN AFTER PRESIDENT BIDEN. INSTITUTE INSTEAD OF ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY POOR TATIAN MORATORIUM ICE DEFIED THE PRESIDENT CONTINUED HIS DEPORTATION MACHINE. ADDITIONALLY COUNTLESS FORMALLY INCARCERATED IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES ARE SYSTEMATICALLY BEING TRANSFERRED IS WITHOUT REGARD TO CIRCUMSTANCE PASSWORD TOWARD REHABILITATION OR FAMILY CONNECTIONS. OF IN CALIFORNIA. ULTIMATELY CONGRESS WHAT IS WILL NEED TO DECIDE HOW GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS ARE TRANSFERRED AND HOW- AND HOW WE CAN REIMAGINE ARE A COMPLEX AND CONTROVERSIAL IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. HOWEVER ASIA ONE AS NECESSARY TO HELP INFLUENCE THE DEBATE IN A MANNER THAT UPHOLDS VALUES A DUE PROCESS EQUALITY UNDER THE LAW. AND FAMILY UNITY.

EIGHTY EIGHT FORTY NINE IS GOING TO ALLOW A WERE. SENIOR LIVING AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES TO RECOVER FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN DAMAGES PER VIOLATION RATHER THAN THE TOTAL WHICH WILL CLARIFY A LAW THAT HAD HAD PASSED WHICH WAS THEN INTERPRETED BY THE CASE OF JARMAN VERSUS H. C. R. AND WE NEED TO CORRECT THIS. ON THE LINE. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL OR TOM TONY. CHECK OUT A CHECK- TELL. FROM THE CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM AND JANICE GERMAN THE PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT IN THE GERMAN CASE WHOSE FATHER SUFFERED REPEATED VIOLATIONS WHILE RESIDING AT A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. OKAY THANK YOU I HAVE. I HAVE LISTED JACQUI CERNER FROM THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA AND JANICE GERMAN SO IS THERE SOMEONE. ELSE WILL TAKE TO WITNESSES COULD YOU PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF FOR A RECORD. HI THIS IS JANET SHERMAN ALL RIGHT GO AHEAD. MY FATHER WHAT'S JOHN GERMAN YEAH- AT NINETY YEARS OF AGE HAVE AN ACTIVE LIFE SWIMMING IN THE POOL THREE TIMES A WEEK AND LIVING IN HIS OWN HOME. MY FATHER WAS SUPPOSED TO GET- REHAB THERAPY AT MANOR CARE NURSING HOME FOLLOWING A HIP SURGERY. AND THEN COME HOME IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS. THIS TIME THERE BECAME A LIVING NIGHTMARE. NO ONE RESPONDED TO HIS CALL LIGHT AND CALLS FOR HELP ONE TIME I VISITED HIM AND I FOUND IN HALF NAKED AND COVERED AND SHE SHE EACH. NURSING HOME STAFF WOULD LEAVE HIM SITTING ON A BED PAN TELLING HIM TO PRESS THE CALL LIFE WHEN HE WAS DONE. HE TOLD ME THAT HIS BOTTOM HURT AND WE DISCOVERED PRESSURE SORES ON HIS BOTTOM. THIS LASTED FOR THREE MONTHS I FELT HELPLESS AND I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW MY FATHER MUST HAVE FELT. WE WANT TO TRIAL AGAINST THE NURSING HOME. THE JURY FOUND THAT MANORCARE VIOLATED MY FATHER'S RIGHTS THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO TIMES. I FELT THAT THE JURY HEARD MY FATHER THAT DAY BUT MY FEELING THAT JUSTICE WAS DELIVERED WAS SHORT LIVED. I WAS SURPRISED AND SADDENED TO LEARN THAT LAST YEAR THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT WIPED AWAY THE JURY'S VERDICT REDUCING ALL THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO VIOLATIONS DOWN TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. IT PAINS ME TO THINK THAT THE NURSING HOME PROVIDE MY FATHER'S RIGHTS OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND GET AWAY WITH IT FOR ONLY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. WHAT CHERISHES THEY'RE IN NOW. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. IT ANGERS ME TO THINK THAT THERE IS A KNOWN SO GET AWAY WITH THIS BUT EVERYONE ELSE WHO HAS TO STAY AND LIVE IN ONE. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE SPEAKING TODAY. AS MUCH AS I WISH I CANNOT TAKE AWAY ALL OF THE TIME MY FATHER WAS TREATED WITH INDIGNITY AS IF HE WERE LESS THAN HUMAN. I ALSO KNOW THAT I HAVE TO ACCEPT THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION. BUT I HOPE THAT YOU HEAR MY FATHER'S STORY TODAY JUST LIKE THAT THE JURY DID. SO THAT MANOR CARE AND ALL OTHER NURSING HOMES YOU KNOW THAT THEY CANNOT GET AWAY WITH THE NIGHTMARISH BAIT BECAUSE FOR THE SMALL PRICE OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR EACH RESIDENT. I URGE YOU JUST SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT OR NINE SO THAT OTHER FAMILIES DON'T LOSE ACCOUNTABILITY AND SO THAT OTHERS DO NOT SUFFER LIKE MY FATHER DID. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. YES HI GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU CARE PERSONS DOWN COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND STAFF THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN AB EIGHT ONE NINE MY NAME IS TONY TICKETS ON THE STAFF ATTORNEY FOR CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOMES IN ON. I SPENT MY WHOLE CAREER REPRESENTING OLDER AND DISABLED ADULTS AND FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHTS. WHEN I BEGAN MY WORK IN NURSING HOMES I WAS PRETTY ALL THAT THE SIGNIFICANT RIGHT DECORATIONS THAT ARE CRITICALLY CHAINLINK. WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT TO RESIDENTS WHO HAD SUCH LITTLE POWER. AND A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE TOLD ME ABOUT HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE SECTION THIRTEEN THIRTY BE AND FRANKLY THAT'S WHEN MY CAREER AND- PART OF MY LIFE CHANGED. FOURTEEN THIRTY BE IS A REMARKABLE STATUTE EMPOWERS RESIDENTS TO ENFORCE THEIR OWN RIGHTS. CANNOT BE RELIANT ON THE STATE. THAT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE STATE ENFORCEMENT OF THAT OUR RIGHTS HAS BEEN AT BEST UNRELIABLE. FOURTEEN THIRTY BE A GREAT DEAL TO RESIDENTS THAT THEY'VE USED IT EVEN SURE ADEQUATE STAFFING SO THAT THEY CAN GET HELP TO THE TOILET IN TIME. IF YOU TO GET COMPENSATION ON THE BEEN DUMPED IN THE HOSPITALS ARE HOMELESS SHELTERS AND THEY USE THAT THE STOP. ILLEGAL DRUG IN THE PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS. IN ALL THESE CASES THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WAS DOING NOTHING TOWARD LONGEST NO HELP. THE GERMAN CASE BASICALLY BROKE FOURTEEN THIRTY THREE. A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR CAP FOR BURSTING MAKES IT PROFITABLE WHICH ARE NURSING HOME RESIDENT. HISTORIES ARE OFF THE HOOK FOR FIVE HUNDRED BUCKS. NO MATTER HOW OFTEN HELD VICIOUSLY THEY VIOLATED THAT THE RIGHT. THE OPPONENTS OF EIGHTY EIGHT FORTY NINE. SINCE THE ARGUE THE SKY WILL FALL AT THE STATUTE IS RESTORED TO GIVE PRESIDENT DAMAGES THAT ARE PROPORTIONAL TO THE HARM THAT STUFF FOR. RESIDENTIAL BE CHEAPER VIOLATION DAMAGES FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS THIS GUY HELD UP JUST FINE. THE POSITION IS REALLY. QUITE UPSETTING. THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS WANT THE STATE TO CODIFY POLICY THEIR RESIDENT RIGHT DON'T REALLY COUNT. AND THAT RESIDENT INTEREST DON'T REALLY MATTER. THE READY TO RESPOND THE NURSING HOMES THAT ARE FIGHTING THE IDEA PROPORTIONAL DAMAGES. IS HOW BOUT YOU JUST OUT BY LEADING OUR RIGHTS. EIGHTY EIGHT POINT NINE RESTORED FOURTEEN THIRTY BE TO WHAT WAS AND WHAT IT REALLY SHOULD BE AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN THE FIGHT TO PROTECT RESIDENTS IN THE WELL BEING. PLEASE VOTE YES ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. RIGHT OPERATOR WOULD YOU OPEN THE LINES FOR OTHERS WHO WANT TO INDICATE SUPPORT FOR A BI. EIGHT FORTY NINE.

THERE'S NO QUESTION THE PANDEMIC THIS PUT THE SKILLED NURSING INDUSTRY UNDER INCREDIBLE STRAIN AND NOT ALWAYS IN THE LIGHT MOST FAVORABLE. IN THAT VEIN AB EIGHT FORTY NINE SOUNDS WELL INTENTIONED. SEASON IT SOUNDS LIKE THE PANACEA IN FACT. YOU WOULD THINK THAT WITHOUT THIS BILL THERE'S LITTLE ENFORCEMENT OF NURSING HOMES OR AN INABILITY FOR A PATIENT TO BE MADE WHOLE. WHEN THEY SUFFER HARM. THAT'S FOX THERE ARE NO LESS THAN THIRTY AGENCIES THAT OVERSEE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THERE ARE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR QUALITY CARE. IN THERE ARE MULTIPLE AVENUES TO SUIT FROM TRADITIONAL TORCH TO A DAPPER. TO HELP THE SAFETY CODE FOURTEEN THIRTY EIGHT AND OTHERS. THIS BILL PORTRAYED THE JUSTICE PORTRAYS THE JUSTICE FOR PATIENTS AS IF IT RUN SOLELY THROUGH FOURTEEN THIRTY BE FOURTEEN THIRTY B. WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO AS A CAPSULAR. TO ENFORCE A PATIENTS BILL OF RIGHTS THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED A FEW YEARS EARLIER. FOURTEEN THIRTY BE WAS MEANT TO PROVIDE A QUICK REMEDY. FOR RESIDENTS TO PURSUE AWARDS FOR INTANGIBLE HARMS OF NOMINAL VALUE. ARISING FROM THESE RIGHT VIOLATIONS. THE INTENT WAS TO PRODUCE A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR CAP IN LIEU OF ANY STANDARD OF PROOF OF ACTUAL DAMAGES. YES THIS LAW HAS BEEN ON THE BOOKS FOR A WHILE BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT THE STATUTE WAS SO HEAVILY ABUSED. FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY TEN A HUMBLE COUNTY JURY AWARDED SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN A CLASS ACTION. THEY DID NOT ALLEGE ONE SINGLE ALLEGATION OF PHYSICAL HARM. AFTER THAT DISABILITY FILE BANKRUPTCY THE CASE SETTLED FOR FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS SPREAD OVER THIRTY TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE AFTER FEES AND COSTS ARE TAKEN OUT. THOSE PATIENTS MAY BE A QUICK ACCRUED A HUNDRED DOLLARS OR SO. THE OTHER HALF OF THAT WENT TO TRIAL LAWYERS. THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE THIS BILL WILL DO NOTHING TO ADDRESS QUALITY FACTS IN THIS WITH THE HIGHEST QUALITY METRICS WILL HAVE A 40% CHANCE OF GETTING SUIT. AB FORTY NINE WILL SIMPLY BRING ABOUT MORE BANKRUPTCIES HUGE ATTORNEY AWARDS AND LITTLE IMPACT ON QUALITY OF CARE. FOR THESE REASONS WE MUST OPPOSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. N. BARBARA GLAZER. HE SAID GOOD AFTERNOON SHARE NUMBERS BARBARA GLAZER WITH A CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION REGULAR REGRETTABLY WE TOO ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL. APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED OF OUR HOSPITALS IN CALIFORNIA OPERATE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY AND IT IS ON BEHALFOF THESE FACILITIES THAT WE OPPOSE AB EIGHT FORTY NINE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ARE LOCATED IN RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE AND OPERATED BY WORLD HOSPITAL. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF AB EIGHT FORTY NINE ON THE FINANCIALLY FRAGILE BECAUSE PHILIPPINE. POLICY THAT PLACES NO CAP ON AN AWARD AND ALLOWS MONETARY AWARDS PROVIDE LESION COULD SIGNIFICANTLY HARM IN IN SOME CASES EVEN CLOSE THE NET. THEY ARE OFTEN THE SUCH THIS'LL IN THEIR- FOR THESE CENTS AND THE REASONS STATED BY THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES WE OPPOSE AB EIGHT FOUR NINE THANK YOU THANK YOU OPERATOR WOULD YOU OPEN LINES FOR ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO.

THANK YOU YOU MAY NOW CLOSE THE LINE THEN I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. LIZ DAVIES THANK YOU AND THIS QUESTION IS THE FOR THE M. OPPOSITION OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE GOOD ACTORS AND BAD ACTORS- ALL OVER SPECIALLY WE HAVE BAD ACTORS WHEN IT COMES TO THE NURSING HOME. FACILITIES WHAT WOULD BE YOUR SUGGESTION I UNDERSTAND- THAT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR PER VIOLATION WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO WORK WITH SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE A HIGHER AMOUNT CONSIDER THERE ARE OTHER AVENUES THAT. THEY CAN TAKE LEGALLY. SURE I COULD SHAKE LEVINE SURE GO AHEAD- AND SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GOOD QUESTION- I THINK AT THIS POINT YOU KNOW I THE INDUSTRY IS NOT DEFENDING FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER. CASE IN IN WITH THAT AND DISCUSSION CERTAINLY WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE ABOUT THAT AND THERE'S AN OPEN US FOR US TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. ABOUT WHAT THE AUTHORS OFFICE MISTAKE ALWAYS ABOUT WHAT THAT REMEDY MAY LOOK LIKE- AND THAT MADE A HIGHER FINE ABOUT- THE THING FOR OUR INDUSTRY LIKE ANY OTHERS IS CERTAINLY- YOU KNOW WE NEED CERTAINTY- WE HAVE OUR LIABILITY CARRIERS OBVIOUSLY HAVE INSURANCE CONSIDERATIONS WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. ANY OTHER THING THAT THAT IS JUST CRIPPLING ABOUT THE FOURTEENTH THIRTY B. STATUTE IS THE MULTIPLIER FACT THIS THE STACKING IF YOU WILL- WERE IT JUST HAS THIS CASCADING EFFECT THIS PERVASIVE EFFECT THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY SO WE SEE YOU KNOW THESE YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY YOU KNOW ROUTINELY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN FINES UPWARDS OF THE CASE I CITED TWENTY CHANNEL WHAT COUNTY CASE OF. SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. I'D BE WHAT ONE OF THE- TO MISS IS OR SOMEONE ELSE COULD. REDUCE RESPOND. MY CONCERN IS WE YOU START ALL OF THE VIOLATE- YOU KNOW WE'RE SOMEONE GO TO. AND WITH THIS BE INCREASING SOME AGAIN WE KNOW THE COST OF HOUSING YOU KNOW THE COST OF THE YOU KNOW CARE- IS REALLY GOING HIGH I'M CONCERNED IS WELL IF IT KEEPS GOING UP LIKE THAT THAT'S JUST GOING TO GO BACK TO- THOSE THAT WANT TO BE STAKE IN ONE OF THOSE PLACES. I WOULD REFER YOU TO THE- THE NET THE ANALYSIS WAS PRETTY GOOD WHEN IT CAME TO TALKING ABOUT- THE EFFECT ON THE NURSING HOMES AND WHETHER THIS WAS GOING TO FORCE THEM ALL TO GO TO BANKRUPTCY. FOR YEARS IT DIDN'T HAPPEN- THIS WAS THE LAW THIS IS IT WAS INTERPRETED DIFFERENTLY AND IT WAS PER VIOLATION- I WOULD LIKE TO ASK. MR TICKET TELL IF HE WOULD ALSO RESPOND. MR TICKET ARE YOU STILL ON THE LINE. RIGHT I GUESS NOT YESTERDAY I HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE NEEDING. GO AHEAD. BRIEF ANSWER PLEASE. YEAH I MEAN REALLY FOURTEEN THIRTY B. WE HAVE THAT THE QUESTION OF IS IT TO PROTECT RESIDENTS FROM HAVING A LIKE VIOLATED OR TO PROTECT THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF NURSING HOMES THAT VIOLATE PRESIDENT RIGHT. FOURTEEN THIRTY B. HAS. AND IT IS CERTAINLY NO PANACEA- THERE- RESIDENTS RIGHTS VIOLATION MOSTLY A CURRENT I NEVER ANSWERED THERE'S NO LAWSUIT FILED- AND YOU KNOW WORRIES PREVENTABLE TO A LOT OF RESIDENTS BUT FOR THOSE WHO DO HAVE THE RESOURCES TO GET ATTACHMENT TURNING CAN BE BE REALLY LIKE STATE IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT ON THE INDIVIDUAL RESIDENT AND THE RESIDENTS AND THE ENTIRE STUDY THAT THAT RESIDENTS REPRESENTATION AND THE STOPPING OF THOSE VIOLATIONS REPRESENT- YEAH JUST SPEAKING TO THE HUMBLE COUNTY CASE THAT CASE ENDED UP SETTLING FOR FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS BUT THAT CASE WAS ABOUT. WAS THIRTY TWO THOUSAND RESIDENTS IN TWENTY TWO NURSING HOMES THAT SUFFERED FROM ONE POINT TWO MILLION DAYS OF THE FACILITY BEING UNDERSTAFFED THAT'S ONE POINT TWO MILLION A CURRENTLY PER RESIDENT OF THE FACILITY BEING CHRONICALLY UNDERSTAFFED IN THE REASON WHY IT WAS UNDERSTAFFED WAS TO INCREASE PROFIT SO EVEN IN THIS ONE OUT LIAR CASE IN THAT TRUST ME THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT OUT WHERE CAN I TOOK PROBABLY TWO DOZEN. FOURTEEN THIRTY CHANGES IN OUR AVERAGE CAN SETTLEMENT. WAS PROBABLY ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. BUT IN THAT ONE OUT LOWER CASE- IT WAS A SIGNAL. CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AND- LOTS AND LOTS OF FARM SUFFERED BY RESIDENTS DUE TO CHRONIC UNDERSTAFFING IN THE NAME OF A CUTTING COST SAVINGS AND MULTIPLYING PROFITS. THANK THE QUESTIONS. BERMAN THIS TOO MISTER CHAIRMAN- I AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH BOTH SIDES ON THIS ISSUE AND- AND- IT JUST TOOK A COUPLE OF QUICK THOUGHTS FIRST- HAVING READ THE TWENTY TWENTY SUPREME COURT CASE I THINK IT REALLY POINTS AT THE PORTS OF OUR WORK HERE- BECAUSE CLEARLY THAT CASE TURNED ON- AN AMBIGUITY IN THE LAW THAT THE COURT DECIDED ON ONE WAY BUT OBVIOUSLY THERE WERE DISSENTING OPINIONS AND I THINK IF THERE ARE ONE OR TWO WORDS INSERTED INTO THAT- WE WOULDN'T BE HERE SAID SO THAT WAS INTERESTING TO ME- BUT THE OTHER THING- REMARK IS. HAVING MET WITH BOTH SIDES I DO UNDERSTAND THERE MIGHT BE OTHER WAYS AND HOW WE RESOLVE THIS- THAT WOULD. ESTABLISH THE PROPER DISINCENTIVES FOR THE BEHAVIOR WE DO NOT WANT TO HAPPEN. THAT BEING SAID WE DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER PROPOSALS INFRONT OF US WE HAVE A PROPOSAL. TO CHANGE THE STATUS QUO AND I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW I DON'T I THINK IT'S CHALLENGING FOR US. TO SAY THAT THERE SHOULD ONLY BE. FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER ACTION SO WITH THAT. I DO PLAN TO BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY- HI I WOULD HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE CONVERSATIONS- TO SEE IF THERE. ARE BETTER WAYS TO STRUCTURE THIS- BUT BUT I THINK FOR NOW- IT IT MAKES SENSE FOR US TO MOVE THIS FORWARD WE CERTAINLY THIS IS BEHAVIOR THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS- WITH- WITH WITH WHAT IS AND- WHAT IS. WHAT IS IN THIS PROPOSAL AND- LOOK FOR THE FUTURE CONVERSATIONS ON IT. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT SEEN ANOTHER YOU MAY CLOSE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I.
