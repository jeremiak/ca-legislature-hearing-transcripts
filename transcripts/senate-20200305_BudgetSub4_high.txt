BUT FOR THE WORKING WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF TO HELP WE GET THESE A PUZZLES GROUP. ALL IS REQUEST CHEN FUND OVER THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR THIS IS DIRECTOR. OF COUNSEL. TO SUBMIT A REPORT THE LEGISLATURE JANUARY THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO. TO FIRST ASSESS HOW THE CAL RANSPORTATION PLAN ANOTHER TRANSPORTATION EFFORTS AND- CAN BE. OF A STATEWIDE MULTI TRANSPORTATION TO. AND HOW STATE'S TRANSPORTATION HOUSING GRANT COULD BETTER BE ALIGNED CORD. THE BE COORDINATED. ON THE INCLUDES BOTH FUN FOR A LIMITED TERMS AT. ASPEN RESEARCH CORDON THAT STUDY AND WORK WITH A DIFFERENT ANSWER. AND IN TRANSPORTATION CO. AND AS WELL AS FUNDING TO HIRE A AND- OR WORK THE USE TO DO. RESEARCH ON A TRANSFER ASIANS IN CAL. WELCOME TO. ENTERTAINING QUESTIONS. YOU'RE AWESOME YOU THANK YOU MAN TO WELL I HAVE SO MUCH IN IS WITH THE HIRING OF A POSITION BE ABLE TO DO THAT I GUESS MY QUESTIONS ARE MORE ALONG THE LINES OF I THINK THE SECOND- POINT THE SECOND POINT THAT YOU'RE A SET OUT TO ASSESS THE STATE'S TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING GRANT. PROGRAM THAT KEEPS COMING THE ISSUE OF TRANSPORTATION HOUSING KEEPS COMING UP OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND I THINK FOR GOOD REASONS IS. HOW DO WE HOW DO WE- USE THE FACT THAT WE'RE EXPANDING TRANSPORTATION PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. AND THE PARTS OF THE STATE AND IN THE STATE M. AND IT IT SOMEHOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO HELP SOLVE OUR HOUSING. ISSUES AND VICE VERSA. SO I GUESS I'M CONCERNED THAT ONE I WOULD ASK HOW HOW DO WE GET THERE. AND CAN WE GET THERE SOONER I KNOW THERE ARE REPORT THIS CALL. THE STAFF BEING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT BY FROM. TO TWO SO THAT'S YEARS FROM NOW. MEANWHILE ALL THESE DECISION ARE BEING MADE ABOUT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BOTH AT THE STATE LEVEL AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND LOCAL LEVELS. BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT WITHOUT THIS KIND OF% ASSESSMENT SO- I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE QUESTION IS WHAT HOW WOULD RAIL HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT CONCERT WELL I THINK THIS BUILDS ON EXISTING EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON THROUGH THIS DID YOU BOTH COUNSEL FOR SEVERAL YEARS YOU KNOW. STARTED TO HOW WE LIVE AT ALL THE DIFFERENT DID EUROPE ARMS HOW DO WE BETTER ALLY THOSE THERE'S A BEEN BEEN A BUNCH OF AFTER ON PROVIDING TO AS ON THAT TO LOCAL. AND LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT HOW CAN FIND IN THE LINE WORK TOGETHER I THINK THE ALLEGED IN PASSING THE OF REQUIRE THIS WAS OKAY WE'VE DONE A LOT OF THAT BUT LET'S WHAT ALL THAT AT DONE OVER THE- SO WE AND THEN COME WITH IDEAS ON HOW WE BETTER COORDINATE THAT SO WE COMPLETELY AGREE THAT. THINGS NEED TO BE FASTER BUT I THINK ALSO SO MUCH WORK IT'S BEEN DONE THAT THAT THE LEGISLATURE I THINK WANTED US TO ASSESS IS ON AND PROVE THAT SO WE IS BILL POSSIBLE THE. WHAT IS GRAY. I DO NOT DISAGREE THAT WE NEED TO LOOK. ABILITY ISSUES AND TO DEAL WITH- DISPLACEMENT AND OTHER ISSUES SO I. WHICH IS THAT WE- AND YOU THINK IN THIS ASSESSMENT I KNOW YOU. IT'S THE STATE'S TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM BUT HOW DOES THIS RELATE TO WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE COUNTY LEVEL REGIONAL LEVEL THERE'S LOTS OF FUNDING GOING ON THERE AND AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND JUST WHAT I'VE HEARD- READ IS THAT- AS TWO EXAMPLES THE BART IN THE BAY AREA AND- LA. AND SET THE RIDERSHIP- HAS GONE DOWN. AND YET HERE WE ARE USING THAT AS A REASON TO BUILD MORE HOUSING. ALONG ALONG THE TRANSIT CORRIDORS. SO I GUESS I'M JUST KIND OF HI. WE'RE PUTTING THIS OFF FOR TWO YEARS IS THERE ANY WAY OF FAST FORWARD THAT WE COULD DO THIS QUICKER YOU'RE ASKING FOR ONE POSITION. I DON'T KNOW IF IT WOULD TAKE TO POSITIONS TO DO IT SOONER- BUT- I'M JUST SAYING I THINK THERE'S AN- WHICH WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS LITTLE HOUSING RIGHT TRANSPORTATION. USED AS A MAJOR COMPONENT OF HOW TO ADDRESS THAT REZONING IN ALL OF THIS. I FEEL LIKE WE'RE MAKING DECISIONS WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF THIS INFORMATION AND THIS ASSESSMENT I MEAN WE'RE CERTAINLY OPEN TO REEVALUATING NOW WE CAN FAST TRACK THIS YOU KNOW WE'RE BASING IT OFF ON THE ON THE STATUTORY DEADLINES- I THINK. IS FAR AS LOOKING AT JUST THE STATE PLAN I MEAN YOU KNOW MY VIEWS THAT WE WANT TO LOOK AT THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN STATE PLAN HOW THEY ALL INTER AND INTRA AND GATHER WE HAVE A FULL. THE DONE THE SCOPE OF WORK FOR THE ENTIRE STUDY. POINT BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY WORK WITH STAFF TO FIGURE OUT OF OTHER WAYS THAT WE CAN FAST TRACK THIS TO MAKE IT HAPPEN QUICKER. THANK YOU VERY GOOD I THAT BRINGS BUT YES- SENATOR. MADAM CHAIR JUST AN OBSERVATION AS WE AGAIN AS I'VE REVIEWED THE BUDGET THUS FAR AS IT PROGRESSED THERE ARE AN AWFUL LOT OF THE LIGHTS BEING APPLIED FOR AGENCY BY AGENCY. AND I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THE NUMBERS THAT WE'RE BUILDING. IT'S PART OF THE BASE AND WE HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS OF THE BASE BECAUSE WE WERE ONLY PRECARIOUSLY BALANCED AND IT DOES SEEM LIKE THERE ARE A LOT OF- DEPARTMENT SUTTER STAFFING UP IF YOU WILL SO MY POINT IS GOING TO BE VERY DISCERNING ABOUT THAT AND- RE SEEKING THE- BEST OF JUSTIFICATIONS. FOR THE POSITION THAT'S JUST A GENERAL OBSERVATION AS WE PROCEED. THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN- THIS THIS SOME ISSUE RACES I WANT AND ONE AT. PUT A FINER POINT ON IT BECAUSE IT I THINK CENTER DID NIELSEN IS CORRECTED IN REGARDS TO YOU KNOW AS WE LOOK AT. WHERE WE'RE GONNA EXPAND RESOURCES I THINK WE HAVE TO BE WISE ABOUT HOW WE GROW GOVERNMENT BUT THIS IS A LITTLE BIT. CONCERNING BECAUSE- WHEN GOVERNOR BROWN DID THE REORGANIZATION HOW HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION WERE SEPARATED IN SEPARATE AGENCIES AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS. AND AS A CONSEQUENCE- WHICH AT A COMMITTEE THAT WAS NOT PART OF HIS REORGANIZATION WAS ESTABLISHED BY- LEGISLATION IT WAS CLEAN UP LEGISLATION. AND A COMMITTEE WAS SET UP WITH HOUSING ALL THE HOUSING DEPARTMENT AND THAT ALL OF THE TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT'S TO MEET ON A REGULAR BASIS. AND IT WAS THERE THAT IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE PUBLIC TRANSIT. PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION CONSTRUCTION FUN BUT WHATEVER THAT PROGRAM IS. I IT THAT WERE GRANTED. TO TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES. AND THE LOCAL SURROUNDING CITY OR COUNTY THAT CONTROL THE LAND USE OF POLICIES THE MONEY WAS GIVEN ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT INCREASED DENSITIES WOULD OCCUR ALONG MAJOR TRANSPORTATION ROUTES THE REASON THAT'S IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE- IT ENCOURAGED. EIGHT WHY VARIETY OF INCOME LEVELS TO TAKE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. AND. AND SO THE MONEY WOULD GRANTED MOSTLY TO BIG CITIES. AND THE LOCAL LAND USE AUTHORITIES MOSTLY CITIES WOULD THEN REFUSED TO UP ZONE THE AREA- AND BECAUSE THEY WERE PART OF THE CONTRACT THERE WAS NO OPPORTUNITY TO CLAW BACK MONEY THAT HAD BEEN GRANTED TO THOSE COMMUNITIES- AND SO- SO I JUST GET CONCERNED WITH THAT NOW WE- WE'VE TAKEN IT OUT OF THE PURVIEW OF THE TRANSPORTATION IN THE HOUSE. ENTITIES AND PUT IT IN PR IS PARTICULAR REQUEST MMHM I'M LOOKING AT STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL IN IN REALITY THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL WAS WITH ESTABLISHED INITIALLY JUST TO. DO FUND FUNDS TO FIND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO WORK ON A REGIONAL BASIS AND NOW WE'RE KIND OF MOVING THINGS AWAY FROM THE TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING AND MOVING THEM INTO AN ENTITY THAT'S CONTINUING TO GROW SO I JUST YEAH I'M I'M I'M I'M PREPARED TO. SUPPORT THIS RIGHT- I THINK IT NEEDS A LITTLE BIT MORE THOUGHT BUT- JUST IN TERMS OF THAT WHOLE SCENARIO- AND I GET CONCERNED BECAUSE. IT HEY DON'T THINK THE INVESTMENT IN ANY CD HAS BEEN MADE- THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT VACANCIES AND THE THERE'S NO HEAD OF THERE'S NO DIRECTOR AND THAT'S KIND OF BEEN A PERSISTENT ISSUE- THAT CREATES CONCERN BECAUSE HOUSING IS OUR NUMBER ONE ISSUE WE DON'T HAVE A DIRECT. YEAH WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH STAFF ON ON THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT WANT INCLUDE IN AND THE STUDY OF THE ASSESSMENT YOU KNOW ONE ONE. THING THAT THEY OVER THE YEARS- PR HAS BEEN TASK WITH IS DOING RESEARCH AND STUDIES ON. ISSUE AREAS THAT THEY CUT ACROSS DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND SO I THINK THAT MAY BE ONE REASON WHY I WAS WAS PUT IT HEALTHCARE IS THAT. YOU MAY GET POINTED HOUSING TRANSFER CAN CUT ACROSS A VARIETY OF AGENCIES DEPARTMENTS. INSTITUTIONS IN CALIFORNIA- AND SOMETIMES. THE LEGISLATURE OTHERS DON'T WANT TO GIVE. A RESEARCH PROJECT JUST TO CALTRANS OR- KELSO BECAUSE THEN THEY MAY LOOK AT IT IN A CERTAIN LIGHT SO. I THINK PR IN THE IN THE PASS IS CHOSEN TO TRY TO LOOK AT IT FROM A BROAD. SENSE IN THAT BE THE REASON. SLATER BUT IT W. YEAH. A GOOD. I'M I'LL ENTERTAIN ANY MORE QUESTIONS THIS I WILL ENTERTAIN ON THIS SO. MOST HAS BEEN MADE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. CABALLERO AYE NIELSEN NO RAZA BY. THE MOTION PASSES TO MOVING ON TO ITEM NUMBER ISSUE NUMBER FIVE. THE CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE STRATEGY.

AND PURSUING. THE VIRGINIA AXE FOR CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. REALLY ARE THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE ENGAGE CALIFORNIANS IN TACKLING OUR BIGGEST PROBLEMS AND TAKING ACTION LOCALLY AND WE'VE HAD WE'VE STARTED INVESTING IN SOME REALLY CREATIVE WAYS THAT WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT INCLUDING LAUNCHING WHAT AT WHAT I LIKE TO CALL THE CALIFORNIA GI BILL WHERE WE'VE BEEN A PROGRAM YOU SEE MERCED IN OUSTED LA AND OTHER UNIVERSITY HELP THOSE STUDENTS WHO ARE WILLING TO SERVE THEIR- THE UP FOR COLLEGE. SCHOLARSHIP AND THIS DEPEND IN ACT CREDIT WE'VE ALSO RECENTLY ANNOUNCED A HISTORIC INVESTMENT INTO THE CENTER VALLEY TO GREAT SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES AND LEFT OUT COMMUNITIES WE RESPONDED TO COMMUNITIES INCLUDING BUTTE COUNTY- AND OTHER DISASTER AREAS WHO ARE GOING THROUGH RECOVERY- IN SOME VERY INNOVATIVE WAYS SO WE'RE VERY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT OVERHEAD HOW WE NEED TO GET IS V. OF UNITED KEY BORN IN. IN SERVICE AND INVOLUNTARY AND MOSTLY I AND THIS BY JUST TO SAY THAT. WITH YOU ALL. I TO PURSUE THIS V.

CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS REQUESTING ONE POINT SEVEN FOUR MILLION AND TEN POSITIONS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND ONE POINT SIX NINE MILLION AND TWELVE POSITIONS IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND ONGOING. WITH THE GOAL TO EXPAND SERVICE CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS DEDICATED BUILDING OUR BEST SERVICE STRUCTURE. WITH A STAFFING CAPACITY TO SUPPORT FUTURE STATE AND CONTINUED FEDERAL INVESTMENTS. OUR OVERALL GOAL IS TO CREATE A CULTURE OF SERVICING PURGING CALIFORNIANS MEAN GAUGING THEIR COMMUNITIES START HERE WITH THIS INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S- HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ON THIS FUNDING PROPOSAL. THE GOOD. FOR TAYLOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I HAVE NOTHING GAP AND MOVE A LITTLE TO NO FOR QUESTIONS FOR YOU. GOOD HELLO I'M BRIAN WHETHER FOR WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT THIS REQUEST EXPAND THE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEER STAFF FROM TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE- IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET INCLUDED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS AND I FUNDS FOR GRANTS TO SERVE. THE EXPANSION OF THE AMERICAS PROGRAMS HERE IN THE STATE. ON THE GOVERNOR'S MADE EXPANDING THE CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS FROM PRIORITY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. YOU WILL WALK AWAY THIS AGAINST YOUR OTHER COMPETING PRIORITIES AND TO THE EXTENT THAT EXPANDING THIS PROGRAM DOESN'T WANT YOUR PRIORITIES- WE SUGGEST YOU MIGHT CONSIDER REQUIRING ADMINISTRATION ASSISTANT CLEAR OBJECTIVES- FOR THE PROGRAM INTO A MEASURE ON AN ONGOING BASIS HOW EFFECTIVE IT IS. SUBJECT WE- GIVE. QUESTION FROM THE- YEAH. THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR FRIDAY FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK I'VE BEEN TO YOUR OFFENSE THEY'RE QUITE EXCITING TO SEE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SO EXCITED TO BE VOLUNTEERS AND TO IS THEMSELVES- FOR THE GOOD OF THEIR COMMUNITY I ONE QUESTION I HAVE WITH REGARDS TO THE- THE ADMINISTRATION'S OR GET OF TEN THOUSAND VOLUNTEERS. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN. HOW AND- JUST WHAT DOES IT MEAN IN ALL ON ALL THOSE DIFFERENT LEVELS WHICH IS A VERY EXCITING GOAL BUT IS THAT WITHIN THIRTY YEARS WITH THAT IN TWO YEARS WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT HERE AND WHAT'S THE PROGRAM TO GET THERE. EXCELLENT SO- GOVERNOR DO SOME HAS MADE THE COMMITMENT TO GET THE AMERICORPS PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY TO TEN THOUSAND VOLUNTEERS THEIR NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT PLAY INTO THAT OBVIOUSLY THE GENERAL FUND AVAILABILITY OF FEDERAL FUNDS- AND DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS PART OF WHAT THESE- POSITIONS ARE FOR IS TO HELP. PARTNERSHIP SO THEIR NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT GO INTO GETTING TO TEN THOUSAND THAT WILL PLAY INTO HOW LONG IT TAKES HOW MANY YEARS HOW DO WE GET THERE- AND SO THE ADMINISTRATION IS LOOKING AT ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND AS WE NOTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SUMMARY- WE WILL BE. LIKELY COMING OUT WITH SOME KIND OF PROPOSAL IN THE SPRING. THEY WILL HAVE MORE DETAIL ON ON A- PLAN TO GET THERE BUT AT THIS POINT WERE CONSIDERING ALL THOSE DIFFERENT- FACTORS IN THAT PLAN. DO YOU EXPECT IN THAT PLAN THAT STILL BE- REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL. ON THE STAFF BEING OF FROM THIS I GUESS I'M NOT GETTING THE CONNECTION BETWEEN- WHAT'S BEING REQUESTED NOW AND ITS CONNECTION TO THE GOAL AND TO THE PLAN- IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A LITTLE BIT AHEAD OF ITSELF NOT SURE HOW. HOW THIS IS GOING FORWARD SO TWO OF THE POSITIONS THAT ARE REQUESTED IN THIS PCP OR SPECIFICALLY IN NORTHERN IN THE SOUTHERN RECRUITMENT COORDINATORS FOR AMERICORPS SO SOMEBODY IN BOTH PARTS OF THE STATE WHO CAN HELP FIND LOCAL. ENTITIES SO FOR AMERICORPS MEMBERS TO PARTICIPATE THEY HAVE TO PARTICIPATE THROUGH A LOCAL ENTITY A NONPROFIT OR OR SOME KIND OF PROVIDER IT'S ALSO MAKING A LOCAL MATCH AND HELPING TO SUPPORT THE NUMBER IN THE VOLUNTEER EFFORTS IN. THIS BE C. P. IN HAS THOSE LOCAL COORDINATOR POSITION AND SO AND SO. PART YOU SEEM TO THOUSAND MEANS THE ABILITY TO FIND THOSE LOCAL. THAT WILL TAKE ON THOSE EXTRA MEMBERS AND EXPANDING AND WHERE DO WE EXPAND TO HOW FAR WE EXPAND WHERE OF THOSE LOCAL PROVIDERS CAN THEY CAN THEY WILL THEY PROVIDE THE MATCH THOSE KINDS OF QUESTIONS ALL HAVE TO BE ANSWERED AND SO THAT'S THIS PART OF THE B. C. P. THE NEXT PART OF OUR PROPOSAL IS THEN WHAT IS IT KIND OF MATCH THAT WE NEED- AND FASTER WE WANT TO GET THAT IS THE GENERAL FUND EMPHASIS IT'LL LIKELY. BECAUSE IT WILL TO BE CONSIDER IN THE OVERALL. YOU KNOW IMPACT OF THE BUDGET AND ALONG WITH EVERYTHING ELSE BECAUSE IT WILL REQUIRE A GENERAL FUND PIECE. THE REQUESTED. REALLY GOOD GOOD QUESTIONS LET ME JUST SAY THAT- I AGREE WITH THE LA IN TERMS OF THE- HAVING A LIST OF OBJECTIVES AND THEN IF YOU COULD- ARTICULATE THE GROWTH OPPORTUNITY OF THE PROGRAM AT. IF IT'S TEN YEARS IT'S YOU KNOW X. NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS- A YEAR. AND THIS IS THE COST THE OF THIS DATE. AS PART OF THAT OBLIGATION AND THEN HERE'S WHAT WE ARE WE'D HAVE TO RAISE FROM OUR PARTNERS JUST SO WE CAN KIND OF GET A ROAD MAP. HOW THAT WOULD WORK I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY SNEAKY BRINGING IN THE VOLUNTEERS YESTERDAY BECAUSE THEY WERE AMAZING I JUST HAVE TO SAY THEY WERE THEY WERE AMAZING AND WHAT WAS EXCITING TO ME ABOUT IT IS I'VE- I'VE BEEN AROUND AMERICORPS VOLUNTEERS FOR MANY. FOR THE MOST PART BECAUSE I DID A LOT OF IS PREVENTION WORK AND FOR THE MOST PART. THE VOLUNTEERS RED CHILDREN AND THEY HELPED IN LATER AND THE IN THE CLASSROOM SO KINDS OF THINGS REALLY IMPORTANT- THE PARTICIPANTS THAT CAME TO SEE ME WE'RE DOING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT WORK- THEY'RE TAKING OUT THE DEAD AND DYING TREES UP IN THE SIERRAS- AND- THEY ARE RECONSTRUCTING- THE CONSERVANCY'S WALKING PATHS AND THINGS THAT. PEOPLE USE VERY HEAVILY OF THE STUDENTS IS VERY INTERESTED IN. WAS INTERESTED IN. IN. THE CLIENT ACTUALLY OF THEM WERE AT THAT SCIENCE OF BUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND DOING MAP OF. OUTLETS INTO THE OCEAN SO THAT WE KNOW WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE AND THEN WHAT THE POTENTIAL FOR. FOR FISH- MIGRATION IS AN INTEREST IN REALLY INTERESTING THINGS THAT GET THEM ON A PATH TO EARNING A DEGREE. OR A CERTIFICATE IN THE END THESE THE KIDS ALL THE YOUNG PEOPLE TELL ME WHERE THEY STARTED FROM AND SO WAS IMPRESSIVE. BECAUSE THEY WERE. THE STATE- SO AS A AS UP UP. AS A CONTROL. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WOULD I WOULD BE FEEL MORE MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE ON IN THE FUTURE IS TO KNOW HOW MANY. STUDENTS PARTY'S PROGRAM GET CREDITS THAT EARN CERTIFICATES DEGREES. ON FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT- THAT THE WORK THAT THE STUDENTS WERE DOING. COULD FIND WORK IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR SO UP WORK READINESS CERTIFICATES THINGS THAT CAN SHOW US THAT BEFORE MAKING A- AND INVESTMENT. IN WHAT I THINK IS AN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM I THINK OF IT AS AN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM BUT THEY'RE ALSO DOING WORK WITH CALTRANS IN THE CONSERVANCY'S- THEN. THAT THAT THAT CONNECTION WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL IN TERMS OF MAKING THIS A PRIORITY BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT'S HARD THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER NEEDS AND IN THE STATE THAT- THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE COMPETING AGAINST THEM. I WOULD I WOULD. IT WORRIES ME TO HAVE A TO THE YOU NEED GOALS BUT TEN THOUSAND IS HOW MUCH BIGGER THAN WHAT WE ARE RIGHT NOW AND JUST TO KNOW- THAT IT IT AND I MY GUESS IS IT'S PRETTY. PEOPLE INTENSIVE IN TERMS OF- ORGANIZING AND TRAINING AND- AND SO CAN UNDERSTANDING THAT RELATIONSHIP WOULD BE REALLY GOOD AS WELL ABSOLUTELY YEAH. THERE ARE NO OTHER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THIS IS AN INFORMATION ONLY AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY THANK. YOU THANK YOU AND I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT THEY'LL BE SOME MORE DETAIL. FOR ME MAKE IT A LOT EASIER. HEY MOVING ON TO- ISSUE NUMBER SIX THE CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN CLIMATE RESILIENT RESEARCH REGIONAL COLLABORATION IMPLEMENTATION. WE GET TAKING MEMBERS FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY- I HAVE KNOWN TURKEY WAS DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CLIENT- JONES AT OPR AND JUST GIVE WENDY WHO'S THE DEPUTY IT'S CHANGE GROWTH COUNCIL THAT THE OKAY SEND HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS OKAY AS NOTED IN THE STAFF REPORT. IN A B. C. P. THEY ALSO PLANNING RESEARCH IN COORDINATION AND PARTNERSHIP WITH CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION- IS REQUESTING TWENTY FIVE MILLION AN ON GOING FUNDING FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND SUPPORT FOR COMPLEMENTARY CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE OF PROGRAMS- NOON TURKEY WILL PRESENT ON. THE OPR AN STC ASPECTS OF THIS PROPOSAL- AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE AND HOPEFULLY BE ABLE ANSWER THOSE AND ANYTHING WE CAN ANSWER WILL GET BACK TO HIS STAFF AND- POINTS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THANK YOU INTERNET GIVE GREAT. SO HELLO AND CHAIR IN SEND A THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY SO AS- SCOTT MORGAN MENTIONED I MANY GIVE I HAVE A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THOSE FOR PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN THAT PROPOSAL IN THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL. AND THEN THEY'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND CLARIFY ANYTHING THAT WE CAN. SO THE REQUEST FOR THE FOR COMPLEMENTARY CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE RELATED PROGRAMS AND OPR INDUSTRY SEE. THE INTENT OF THESE PROGRAMS AND THIS PROPOSAL IS TO. ENHANCE LOCAL CAPACITY ESPECIALLY IN UNDER RESOURCE AND VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND SUPPORT INVESTMENTS IN THE FOUNDATIONAL RESEARCH THAT'S NEEDED BOTH TO REDUCE RISK FROM CLIMATE CHANGE. BUT ALSO SUPPORT OUR WORK TO ECHO W. TRANSITION TO A CARBON NEUTRAL ECONOMY. SO IT'S KIND OF TOP LINE OVERVIEW FOR THE FOR PROGRAMS IN TERMS OF THAT UNIFIED GOAL ACROSS. EACH EACH OF SO THE FIRST PROGRAM IN THE B. C. P. AND THAT WE PROPOSED IS FUNDING FOR CALIFORNIA'S FIFTH CLIMATE CHANGE ASSESSMENT CALIFORNIA HAS A COMPLETED FOR ASSESSMENTS PREVIOUSLY OVER OF COURSE OF A NUMBER OF YEARS. THIS FUNDING WOULD SUPPORT THE FIFTH ASSESSMENT WHICH WOULD SUPPORTA COLLABORATIVE MULTI AGENCY TEAM AS SCOTT MORGAN HAD MENTIONED ACROSS OPR THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL AS WELL AS THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. REALLY BUILDING OFF OF THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL AND COLLABORATIVE APPROACH THAT WE PUT IN PLACE FOR THE FOURTH CALIFORNIA CLIMATE CHANGE ASSESSMENT. THE FUNDING WOULD SUPPORT A SUITE OF PRODUCTS- AND DELIVER BALLS WHICH WOULD INCLUDE INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC CLIMATE RESEARCH TOPICS- REALLY ANSWERING. IN THE ANSWER SOME OF THE MOST PRESSING QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE AROUND RESEARCH QUESTIONS WE HAVE OUR OWN BUT CHANGE IN THE STATE. IT WOULD ALSO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR A TRIBAL RESEARCH KIND OF RESEARCH GRANT PROGRAM WHICH WOULD REALLY SERVICE SOME OLD IN. BUT ALSO POINT- NATIONALLY REALLY BUILDING PAST PROVIDE SIR TRIBES IN CAL YEAH TO DO THEIR OWN RESEARCH TRY. RESEARCH THE OTHER CA. OF THE FUNDING FOR THIS PROPOSAL WOULD TAKEN MEN IN. RIDLEY CRITIC. TOOL AND SOME OF THE TRANSLATE IT'LL WORK THAT'S NEEDED TO MAKE THIS. ACTIONABLE FOR DOES MAKERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE INCLUDING STATE AGENCIES BUT OUR LOCAL AND PARK AS WELL TO REALLY SEEING THE NEED NOT ONLY TO INVEST IN THE RESEARCH BUT MAKING SURE THAT REESE. IS FOR HELPING. OR POLICY MAKING. CHANGE RESEARCH PROGRAM AND SO THIS PROGRAM WAS CREATED BROUGH ASSEMBLY BILL ONE OH NINE AND THIS FUNDING WHICH IS THE REQUEST FOR FIVE MILLION FOR THIS UPCOMING YEAR- BUT WOULD CONTINUE THAT THAT PROGRAM AS WELL. SO MOVING FROM THE TO RESEARCH FOCUSED PROPOSALS TO THAT KIND OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND PASSIVELY BUILDING ITEMS THE THIRD PIECE OF THE PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE FIVE MILLION AB TO FUND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE REGIONAL CLIMATE COLLABORATIVE'S GRANT PROGRAM. THE REGIONAL CLIMATE CLEVERNESS PROGRAM AT THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL WAS ESTABLISHED BROUGH SENATE BILL AND SEVENTY TWO AND CALLS FOR THE CREATION OF A GRANT PROGRAM REALLY TO BUILD CAPACITY IN UNDER RESOURCE COMMUNITIES. TO ACCESS THE FUNDING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT'S NECESSARY TO DRIVE TOWARDS CLIMATE THERE TO ADDRESS CLIMATE IMPACTS AND MITIGATE FUTURE RISK AND ALSO- WORK ON CLIMATE MITIGATION EFFORTS. SO THE FUNDING WOULD ENABLE THE STRATEGIC COUNCIL TO MEET THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS BY PROVIDING THIS GRANT PROGRAM TO COMMUNITIES. THE FOURTH AND FINAL KEYS TO THE PROPOSAL- IN IS ALSO FOCUSED ON SOME OF THE CAPACITY BUILDING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT WE HAVE. BEEN HEARING LOUD AND CLEAR ESPECIALLY FROM OUR LOCAL PARTNERS- AND IT WOULD FIND- EXPANDED CAPACITY AT THE OUR OR OUR INTEGRATED CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCY PROGRAM WHICH WAS ALSO ESTABLISHED THROUGH LEGISLATION THROUGH SENATE BILL TWO FORTY SIX. TO THE FUNDING THAT WE REQUESTED FOR THIS PROGRAM WOULD REALLY- RESPOND TO A NEED THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM MORE STRUCTURED REGIONAL COLLABORATION BETWEEN REGIONS REGIONS ACROSS THE STATE AND OURS AND THE STATE AGENCIES- ESPECIALLY AROUND ADAPTATION. AND IT WOULD ALSO PROVIDE- FOUNDATIONAL FUNDING FOR SOME OF THE FOUNDATIONAL TECHNICAL INFORMATION AND RESOURCES AND ASSISTANCE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ESPECIALLY NEED TO BE ABLE TO START. PLANNING FOR IN IMPLEMENTING CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE EFFORTS TO SOME OF THAT WOULD INCLUDE FUNDING TO HELP ENHANCE OUR EXISTING REQUIREMENTS TO IMPLEMENT THE ADAPTATION CLEARING HOUSE SPECIFICALLY WE HAVE HEARD THE CALL FOR THE NAY NEED FOR ADDITIONAL. INFORMATION AND TOOLS TO HELP IDENTIFY VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE THAT CAN HELP INFORM FUNDING AND POLICY DECISIONS BOTH STATE AND LOCALLY LEAD AND THEN ALSO FUNDING TO SUPPORT A SWEET- OUTCOME BASED CLIMATE pMETRICS THAT CAN REALLY HELP THE STATE BETTER UNDERSTAND WATER ARE POLLS ON RESILIENCE. HOW DO WE TRACK AND MEASURE OUR PROGRESS OVER TIME TOWARDS THOUGH IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE YOU KNOW AS A AS A GAP IN IT. AND THAT IS THE STATE SO THAT'S IN THE FOR THE FOR PROGRAMS THERE'S. A LOT IN THERE I WILL. AND IN. IT VERY GOOD THAT ONLINE. ANY OTHER TESTIMONY FROM THE ADMIN ON. OKAY THE ONLY OFFICE HI BRAIN WITH AFFORDABLE ANALYST'S ON WE PRESENTED OUR FULL- COMMENTS ON THIS PROPOSAL IN THE FULL SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND IT TO SEVILLE BOWL AND- THIS TIME BREAKING A DISTRICT THAT WE PRODUCED OF LAST MONTH AND- AS WELL OUR SYSTEM IS INCLUDED IN YOUR AGENDA SO I WANT TO ADD TO MUCH AT THIS TIME I JUST WANTED TO KNOW IF THESE PROPOSALS REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION. OF THE STATE'S CLIMATE RELATED RESEARCH AND TECHICAL ACTIVITIES AND THAT OVERALL THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS A REASONABLE. HOWEVER THE LEGISLATURE COULD TAKE A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT APPROACH OF IT SHOWS- YOU GENERALLY SHOULD CONSIDER- A PACKAGE OF RESEARCHING TECHNICAL- ACTIVITIES THAT YOU VIEW TO BE YOUR HIGHEST PRIORITIES AND INSUFFICIENTLY FUND THOSE. AND IN ADDITION WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU DOT STATUTORY LANGUAGE FOR ANY HIGH PRIORITY CLIMATE ADAPTATION ACTIVITIES TO PROVIDE LEGISLATIVE GUIDANCE AND GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY. VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH. QUESTION MANY. LET ME GO AHEAD AND START BECAUSE I DO HAVE SOME SOME QUESTIONS AND SOME CONCERNS- LET ME JUST START BY SAYING MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT- THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE IS GOING TO BE DECIDED BY SEPT TWO SO IT'LL BE GOING TO THAT COMMITTEE- AND- WE'RE JUST. THIS DAYS SO I GUESS YOU CAN IGNORE EVERYTHING I SAY. I AM GOING TO VOTE ON THE COMMITTEE ON THE FULL COMMITTEE OF THE BUDGET. BUT BUT HERE'S MY CONCERN AND I I'M I SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT THE- THE LA- HAS- HAS ARTICULATED. YOU KNOW TO A CERTAIN EXTENT I FEEL LIKE WE'RE RESEARCHING TO RESEARCH. AND WE'RE RESEARCHING SOME MORE AND- WEEK WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO. AND PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR CARS. AND YET WE. SOMEHOW THINK THAT IF WE PUT HIM IN AN ELECTRIC CAR THAT TO BETTER THING THEM PUTTING A MINUTE GAS POWERED CAR WHICH IS YOU KNOW A GOOD STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION- BUT I'LL HARP ON SOMETHING I'VE BEEN HARPING ON FOR A REALLY LONG TIME IS UNTIL WE START- CREATING A ROBUST TRANSPORT BUT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. THAT EVERYBODY WANTS TO USE. NOT JUST POOR PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO CHOICE- THAT'S WHY WE SEE THE DECLINING. RIDERSHIP AND WE HAVEN'T. INCLUDED THE SUBURBS OR RURAL CALIFORNIA IN THAT TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE SO AS A CONSEQUENCE- GETTING AROUND IS READ BY PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IS REALLY HARD AND IN RURAL CALIFORNIA AND- PEOPLE PAY FOR REID'S AMONG THEIR FRIENDS READ YOU KNOW IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO GET SOMEWHERE SO. I'M SO THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE IS THAT THE FIFTH CLIMATE ASSESSMENT. DOES NOT INCLUDE CDFA AND TO ME THAT'S A HUGE OVERSIGHT. BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S A- IT'S A DECISION THAT. DOES NOT RECOGNIZE. THAT OPEN SPACE IN AG LAND AND NOT JUST OPEN SPACE FOR OPEN SPACE BUT BE APPROPRIATE- AT. THE LAND MANAGEMENT OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE COULD HELP US TO SOLVE SOME OF OUR OUR AT GREENHOUSE GAS ISSUES AND I SAW A STATISTIC THEM I CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT REPORT CAME FROM BUT THAT WHEN YOU DO A CONVERSION OF AT OF AG LAND OR RANGE LAND TO AN URBANIZED USE. THAT IT. EIGHTY TIMES THE GREENHOUSE GASES AND SO THE MORE THAT WE CONTINUE TO KICK EM EXPAND OUR FOOTPRINT OF CONCRETE THAT THE MORE WE'RE GOING TO BE CREATING PROBLEMS AND THAT INCLUDES ROADWAYS BY THE WAY WHICH IS WHY I AM SUCH AN ADVOCATE FOR. PUBLIC TRANSIT TRANSPORTATION SO I THINK. I THINK THAT- THAT CDFA NEEDS TO BE PART OF THAT AND I MIGHT MY CAUTION. IN SOME OF THIS RESEARCH I'M AND THIS IS JUST- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS THAT. THERE ARE THAT THAT WE DON'T DECIDE WHAT THE SOLUTIONS ARE AHEAD OF TIME AND THEN ONLY STUDY THEM AND SAY WE'VE GOT TO DO THEM WE LOOK AT THE FULL RANGE OF ENERGY OPTIONS- AND- AND UP. COMBINATIONS OF THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING HAT WE'RE GOING TO ASK THE PUBLIC TO JOIN US IN I HAVE YOUNG KIDS NOW IT IS ASKING ME WHAT DO YOU DOING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND- THE ANSWER TO THAT IS WHAT ARE WHAT ARE WE DOING RIGHT. DO YOU NEED A RIDE TO SCHOOL IN THE MORNING OR CAN YOU JUST WALK OR RIDE A BIKE THAT THE KINDS OF CHANGES WE'RE GOING TO ASK PEOPLE TO MAKE AND- YET WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING. THAT INVOLVES AN EDUCATION PROCESS- FOR YOUNG PEOPLE THAT INCLUDES THEM IN THE DECISION MAKING. AGES IF YOU SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS IT'S GOING TO IT'S GOING TO CREATE MORE CLIMATE CHANGE- IF YOU'RE- THROWING YOUR TRASH OUTSIDE THE WINDOW IT'S A IT'S- IT'S GOING TO OUR DRAIN SYSTEMS INTO THE OCEAN IT'S- THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT TELL PEOPLE. YOU KNOW IT IT IT WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO RECYCLE SO MUCH PLASTIC PEOPLE DIDN'T USE PLASTIC RIGHT- SO I MY CONCERN IS JUST- I AM. I'M I'M INTERESTED IN IN MAKING SURE THAT AGRICULTURE IS AT THE TABLE- AND- AND THAT WE LOOK AT NATURAL GAS AS WELL AS- HYDRO AS WELL AS- YOU KNOW SOME OF THE OF A BIO MASS. EIGHT YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE THE TECHNOLOGY'S GOTTEN BETTER OVER TIME AND WE'VE WE'VE IGNORED IT AND SO I SAY THIS BECAUSE I HAVE HAD INTERNATIONAL VISITORS. AND I HAVE TRAVELED INTERNATIONALLY THIS YEAR. AND I'VE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE VERY PROGRESSIVE. ARE USING ALL OF THE AT ALL OF THESE OPTIONS THE CALIFORNIA REFUSES TO BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS PUSH. THAT IT HAS TO BE IN YOU KNOW- ELECTRIC GENERATED BY SOLAR OR WIND AND THAT'S IT AND WE'RE LOSING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH IN RURAL CALIFORNIA SO I IT IF IT THAT NIGHT I HAVE SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH HOW THIS IS LAID OUT IN ONE ONE. ONE FINAL QUESTION ACTUALLY IS WHAT OPPORTUNITIES ARE THERE FOR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF IF ANY OF THAT THE- THE WORK THAT YOU WOULD BE DOING JUST SO THAT WE IT IT'S PRETTY FAN IN TERMS OF. IT IS EXACTLY THE DIRECTION THAT YOU WANT TO GO WITH SOME OF THESE STUDIES. ARE SOME OF THE RESEARCH AND- SO I FROM MY PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE IT. IT IS THEN AND I HAVE SOME. DEFINITE FEELINGS ABOUT OUT THINGS WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT REAL I'M I'M INTERESTED IN GOOD SCIENCE NOT SIGNED SINCE BEEN COOKED BECAUSE WE'VE DECIDED WITH THE SOLUTIONS ARE READY AND SOME. YEAH ME THAT DOWN THE LEGISLATIVE INTERACTION I THINK YOU KNOW PART OF THAT'S GOING TO BE. THE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEES IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND WHAT THAT FINAL KIND OF. YOU KNOW GETTING THE TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN LOOKS LIKE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A SMALL PART OF THAT- SO YOU KNOW. I CAN'T SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THEMSELVES BUT I'M SURE IT IS THAT THE WILLINGNESS THEIR END CAN YOU TO WORK WITH YOU ON ON ISSUES THAT THAT YOU. IS THERE ALL BALLOT ISSUES. AS AN ADJUSTABLE INDIANA STRATEGIC PROCONSUL ANIMAL TAMING YOU'RE SPEAKING OUR LANGUAGE WE ARE. PASSIONATE ABOUT THE SAME ISSUES THAT YOUR PASSION ABOUT OUR COUNCIL. CURRENTLY IS MADE UP OF NOT ONLY THE CHAIR OF THE P. R. BUT ALSO SIX CABINET SECRETARIES OF WHICH- I'M SECRETARY ROSS IS ONE OF THEM. AND SHE IS A PASSIONATE ADVOCATE FOR THE WORK THAT I SHE SEE DOES. AND HAS PROVIDED OVERSIGHT NOT JUST ON THE CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH PROGRAM WHICH IS PART OF THIS. HELLO BUT ALSO- A SEPARATE PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE ON SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE AND LAND CONSERVATION WHICH IS ACTING THE FACT ISSUES. THAT YOU'VE BEEN ADDRESSING AND SO ALL THE PROGRAMS ARE AS SHE SEE ARE DESIGNED TO BE AN INTERDISCIPLINARY AND CROSS SECTORAL WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE. A OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE FOR EACH OF THE PROGRAM'S MADE UP OF MEMBERS FROM EVERYONE OF THE AGENCIES REPRESENTED ON OUR STC COUNCIL. WE HOPE THAT THAT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE COULD HELP LEVERAGE SOME OF THE- QUESTIONS THAT YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT WHICH BY NATURE ARE. AND ASKING PEOPLE TO WORK TOGETHER- ACROSS AGENCIES BUT IN OUR INVESTMENTS WE ALSO ASKED LOCAL REGIONAL COMMUNITIES TO BEGIN BREAKING DOWN THOSE SILOS. AND WORKING TOGETHER AND SO- AND IF YOU WANT TO ADD SPECIFIC THE SCOPE OF WORK WITH THE ASSESSMENT. YEAH I MEAN I THINK ONE OF THE JUST SECONDING THAT- YOU KNOW YOUR COMMENT AND ALSO JESSE'S RESPONSE HERE. THAT THE INTENT REALLY IS TO HAVE A COLLABORATIVE PERSPECTIVE AND LEVERAGIN THE EXISTING NETWORKS THROUGH THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL AS WELL AS- P. OURS ROLE IN- LEADING INTER AGENCY COORDINATION COLLABORATION SO. THE YOU KNOW WHERE THE PROPOSED FUNDING WOULD GO IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE INTENT OF WHO ACROSS THE KIND OF UNIVERSE OF STATE AGENCIES AND PERSPECTIVES WOULD BE INVOLVED IN THE ASSESSMENT BUT JUST. WHERE THE FUNDING FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WHERE THE FUNDING COULD GO TO REALLY ACHIEVE GOALS FOR THE ASSESSMENT BUT WHEN PEOPLE UNIVERSE OF WHO'S INVOLVED AND SETTING THAT AGENDA. SO THIS IS- YOU MENTIONED THE- A NEW STRUCTURE IT THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL- IT'S OUR EXISTING. SO WE HAVE PUBLIC MEETINGS AND THAT ALL THE CABINET SECRETARIES AND THREE PUBLIC MEMBERS AS- LONG WITH A PAIR CHAIR. AND THEY PARTICIPATE WHERE IT'S STAKEHOLDERS ARE ABLE TO COME IN AND ACTUALLY VOICE THEIR OPINIONS ABOUT GUIDELINE PROCESS HE'S IN THE DEVELOPMENT. BUT ALSO. AWARD ON AND FINAL WORDS AND THE DIRECTION THAT THEY WANT THE COUNCIL TO GO IN. AND SO WE HAVE A FEEDBACK PROCESS BUT ALL OF OUR AND- BASED ON SOME OF OUR VALUES THAT WE HAVE IT AS YOU SEE AROUND EQUITY. WE REALLY TAKING THE QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED ABOUT. ARE THE VOICES THAT ARE NOT BEING HEARD. AND IN SOME CASES IT'S THE ROLE COMMUNITIES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- YOU ALSO SPOKE OF YOUNG PEOPLE WE HAVE A- FAIRLY ROBUST TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THAT WE RUN FOR THE CLIMATE CHANGE INVESTMENTS. AND A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT INITIATIVES THERE HAVE BEEN TACKLING THOSE QUESTIONS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ABOUT ENGAGING ACT. NOT JUST ON PEOPLE WHOM FORMER PROCESS BUT DECISION MAKERS OFTEN IN THE WHITE. COMMUNITY SHOULD LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE AND SO I THINK. WE CAN BRING ALL OF THAT TO THE TABLE AS YOU SEE IN THIS PARTNERSHIP. AROUND CLIMATE CHANGE. AND IF I MAY ADD ONE MORE- FOLLOWING ON FROM THAT MAN ONE OF THE- THE PIECES THAT IS IN THIS PROPOSAL FOR THE ASSESSMENT WHICH IS DIFFERENT THAN OR IN ADDITION TO WHAT WAS- UNDER THROUGH THE PREVIOUS ASSESSMENTS. IS REALLY A ROBUST STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE- PUTTING INVEST THE STATE'S INVESTMENT TOWARDS THE RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND TOWARDS THE ISSUES THAT ARE OF MOST NEED TO COMMUNITIES. NOT JUST AYE LOAD YOU KNOW IDEAS THAT COME THROUGH KIND OF AND AT. THE SAME PROCESS SO THE FUNDING AND SG SEE WOULD BE THE LEAD TO THE FOR THAT TYPE OF ENGAGEMENT FOR THE PAST NINE. WOULD BE A LOT OF. NEW LAID OUT AND TO MAKE SURE WHERE. DO IT. I AGREE SIR THE RIGHT IS WHERE THE PRESSING. WHITE THAT I AM. ON MY EXPERIENCE HOW SERVED SERVED ON THE STREET GROWTH A THAT OKAY ARE RAN SHOW. AND BECAUSE WE WERE CABINET MEMBERS HAD. THE BILL TO GO WAIT A MINUTE MAYBE WE SHOULD LOOK AT THIS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY SO- THE KEY IS TO HAVE THE INPUT. AND MAKE SURE EVERYBODY HAS A SEAT AT THE TABLE- AND SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT IT'S- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HOUSING AND THE NEED FOR. THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUSTAINABLE GRANT PROGRAM THAT THAT. WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO HAVE RURAL COMMUNITIES INVOLVED BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THE METRICS ARE SET UP TO REDUCE THEM MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF GHG YOU'RE GONNA BE THAT'S THE BIG CITIES. AND SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US. VERY GOOD ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. SENATOR THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I'M GLAD YOU ENDED ON THAT NOTE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT WAS STARTING TO DEVELOP IN MY MIND IS THE STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT- EIGHT. I DON'T KNOW MAYBE IN BETWEEN THE NEXT NEXT TIME YOU COME HERE- HE COULD PROVIDE OUR OUR OFFICE WITH THE KINDS OF ORGANIZATIONS ON THE GROUND. ARE INVOLVED BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO ME. TO MAKE SURE I'M SORT OF CLOSING THE LOOP HERE ON. THEY RAISE ISSUES TO YOU I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH THEM AS WELL AND- THE P. OR DISAGREE WHATEVER.

OUR STATE GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS MIKE MILLER I'M THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING.

SIX POINT FOUR MILLION ON GOING. AND THIRTY SIX POINT SEVEN PERMANENT POSITIONS TO PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR INCREASING THE VOLUME OF CIVIL RIGHTS COMPLAINTS.

FINANCE NOTHING AT. HELLO THIS MODEL IS WITH THE LA L. THE QUESTIONS NOTED BY STAFF ON THE AGENDA ARE REASONABLE WE HAVE NO AT NO SPECIFIC COMMENTS TO RATE THE THREE OF THOSE ARE THE RIGHT QUESTIONS YOU'RE CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL POSITIONS FOR ANY DEPARTMENT THANK YOU PRETTY GOOD. COMMITTEE CENTER DRAWS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I GUESS THE WITH REGARDS TO THESE NEW FULL TIME SLOTS WHAT IS IT HOW IS IT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHERE THOSE SLOTS GO- DO YOU ALREADY HAVE THE INFORMATION I. MEAN WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE PROCESS TO DETERMINE OF THE ALLOCATION OF THAT NEW. THE STAFF. SO I MERRY WITHIN THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR IN THANK YOU I'M PRETTY QUESTIONS IN TIME- SO WE ALREADY HAVE THE STRUCTURE IN PLACE AND WHAT WE DO IS WE LOOK AT OUR WORKLOAD METRICS AND WE LOOK TO SEE WHERE THE GAPS ARE AND WHERE THE NEED IS AN WHEN IMPLYING THAT STRUCTURE TO OUR NEEDS THAT'S WHERE WE DETERMINE THE NEEDS SO WE LOOK AT YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT OF INVESTIGATIVE TIME VERSUS THE MAN LEGAL TIME. WHAT WE NEED IN OUR SUPPORT FUNCTIONS TO SUPPORT THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT'S HOW WE DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS IN THE CERTAIN CATEGORIES THAT WE ASKED FOR THEM. AND SO AND HOW DID YOU. ARRIVE THE THIRTY SIX NEW POSITIONS- THE STAR FROM THERE WAS A CERTAIN NUMBER OF WORKLOAD OR ARE YOU PROJECTING I KNOW THIS WHERE WHERE THIS- THERE WILL BE A NEED BECAUSE IT'S GROWING AN INCREASING SO MUCH. SO WHAT WE LOOK TO IS THE CURRENT WORKLOAD THAT WE CURRENTLY RECEIVED AS OF THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR AND SO WE LOOKED AT THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS THAT WE RECEIVED AND LOOKED AT THE NUMBER OF HOURS THAT IT WAS TAKING US TO COMPLETE THAT AND WHAT WE NOTICED WAS THERE IS A GAP BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF WORK WE ARE CURRENTLY RECEIVING AND THE HOURS THAT WAS TAKING TO COMPLETE THAT WORK IN A TIMELY MATTER- WE HAVE ONE YEAR TO INVESTIGATE THE COMPLAINTS THE COMMAND- BY STATUTE AND SO WE LOOKED AT THE TIME WHEN WE LOOKED THE AMOUNT OF TIME T WAS TAKING TO INVESTIGATE. AND LITIGATE THOSE CLAIMS AND IN ORDER TO- TO BRIDGE THAT GAP IS WHERE THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS CAME FROM BUT WHAT WERE YOU FIGHTING IN TERMS OF WHAT GAP WAS THE LENGTH OF TIME IT'S THE VOLUME IT'S THE SHEER VOLUME OF COMPLAINTS- WE'VE BEEN MEASURE THE INCOMING NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS AND THEN MEASURING THE AND PROCESSING OF THOSE COMPLAINTS- AND EVERY YEAR. FOR THE LAST TWELVE SINCE LIKE TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN IT'S BEEN INCREASING INCREASING INCREASING. ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST THREE YEARS WE'VE NOTICED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS THAT HAVE COME IN. SO IT'S AT THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS- AND THE LENGTH OF TIME TO INVESTIGATE OR IS IT. IT'S THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS THAT COME IN AND MEASURING THAT AGAINST THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT WE NEED TO COMPLETE ALL OF THOSE COMPLAINTS WITHIN THE ONE YEAR STATUTE. THAT WERE UP AGAINST AND SO IN ORDER FOR US TO COMPLETE THOSE INVESTIGATIONS IN A TIMELY MATTER STATE- ARE NOT OUT OF STATUTE. WE LOOK WEAK COMPARED AGAINST THE WORKLOAD VOLUME THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO PROJECTIONS FOR THIS PARTICULAR. BASICALLY WHAT HAVE WHAT PARTS OF THE STATE HAVE YOU FOUND. THERE ISN'T IN THE SEVENTIES THANK. PARTS OF THIS. SO WE MEASURE IT THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS THE COMMAND BY COUNTY OF THE COMPLAINANT AND OUR HIGHEST VOLUME OF COMPLAINTS OR LOS ANGELES LOS ANGELES COUNTY- SO THAT HAS INCREASED ITS KIND OF PROPORTIONAL- TO THE HIGH DENSITY POPULATIONS IN CALIFORNIA SO WE NOTICED THAT LOS ANGELES ORANGE SAN DIEGO IN SACRAMENTO OR HIGHEST. A COMPLAINT LEVELS THAT HAS BURNED PRETTY STEADY AS WE MEASURE EAGER TO HEAR THOSE AT THE TOP COUNTIES THAT COME IN- WE HAVEN'T HAD A BIG SURPRISE LIKE- YOU KNOW HUMBOLDT COUNTY IS CERTAIN UP TO UP TO THE TOP NOTES BUT ALWAYS BEEN THE HIGH DENSITY POPULATION COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA.AND DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF I I'M I'M SURE POPULATION HAS A LOT TO DO WITH IT BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF OTHER. REACHING OUT TO CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE THAT MAYBE AREN'T COMING TO YOU OR HOW DO YOU DO HOW DO WE- BECAUSE YOU'RE COULD BE CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE THAT. JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE OR HOW. WHY THEY COULD BE MAKING. YOU KNOW THESE COMPLAINTS THAT THIS IS AVAILABLE TO THEM THAT YOU'RE RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE. DO YOU HAVE ANY YEAH WE DO HAVE A TO A FULL TIME EDUCATION AND OUTREACH SPECIALIST WAS AN ATTORNEY. AND HE HAS BEEN STUDYING THE AREAS WHERE- WE SEE THE MOST NEED IN GOING OUT REACHING OUT ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE'VE BEEN TARGETING IS CRIMINAL HISTORY AND JOB APPLICATIONS. AND SENSE HE HAS GONE OUT AND DONE OUT REACH WE HAVE NOTICED AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS THAT WE'VE RECEIVED A PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN COMPLAINING ABOUT DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES IN. THE HIRING PROCESS- REGARDING CRIMINAL HISTORY. SO HE- HE'S BEEN A REALLY GOOD JOB OUT REACHING BUT AS THE OUTRAGEOUS WE DO NOTICE THAT THE NUMBER OF- ALLEGATIONS AND COMPLETE ARMS. HAS HAS RISEN SLIGHTLY. WE ALSO HAVE A- JUST REDID OUR EXTRA WEBSITES WHAT'S MORE ROBUST SO IT HELPED CONTAINS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR EMPLOYERS. AND HOUSING PROVIDERS SO THAT THEY HAVE THE INFORMATION ONLINE- WE HAVE A CALL CENTER THAT ANSWERS QUESTIONS FROM THE PUBLIC. BUT WHAT WE'VE NOTICED THE MOST IS SINCE THE ME TOO MOVEMENT THAT THE MEDIA FOCUS ON A DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES HAS HIGHLIGHTED- BE. A AVENUE OF COMPLAINING FILING A COMPLAINT AND WE HAVE SEEN A SPIKE IN THE LAST YEAR. LIKE ON GENDER. GENDER DISCRIMINATION. AND PAY. AND WHAT WHAT OTHER AREAS YOU MENTIONED- WILL JUST IS JUST BECAUSE YOU YOU DID THE OUT WE DID THE OUTRAGE CRACKING JUSTIN HOME GENDER ISSUES. ANYTHING ELSE THAT'S SORT OF STANDS OUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING RIGHT NOW IS OUT REACHING TO HOUSING PROVIDERS AND- MAKING THEM AWARE OF THE SECTION EIGHT DISCRIMINATORY- THAT THAT THEY COULD NOT DISCRIMINATE BASED ON THE RECIPIENTS OF RECEIPT OF SECTION EIGHT. FUNDING SO THAT'S ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WERE FOCUSING ON RIGHT NOW TRYING TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ON IT SO THAT THEY'RE MORE AWARE THAT. AT WE ARE AN AVENUE FOR THEM AND THAT- WE'RE REACHING OUT TO THE PROVIDERS THEMSELVES AND TRYING TO EDUCATE THEM SO THAT WE CAN PREVENT THE DISCRIMINATION ON THE FOR IN THE- FIRST PLACE. OKAY AND- DO YOU WORK WITH LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS- WITH REGARDS TO EITHER OUT RICHARD TO JUST TO. ASSIST YOU IN IN ANYWAY HOW DOES THAT. WE PARTNER WITH MANY ORGANIZATIONS AS FAR AS DOING OUTREACH WE ARE WE HAVE MADE OURSELVES AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC. PUBLIC SPEAKING AND FOR BEING AVAILABLE FOR BEING A- SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT IF THEY HAVE A OF BANDS WHERE IT WILL REACH A CONCERT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE. YES BECAUSE THE SENATOR HAS- RAISES ISSUE- ABOUT OUR RURAL AREAS IS WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND TO BE THE BEST WAY. TO REACH OUT. TO COMMUNITIES- PROBABLY- SHOULD HAVE LOTS OF. PLANES BUT- DO THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THE SERVICES YES- SO WE HAVE NOTICED THAT THERE ARE DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO WORKERS THAT ARE IN ISOLATED AREAS ARMOR- FARMWORKERS ARE ONE OF THE AREAS THAT- YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD OF IT'S ALSO- JANITORIAL SERVICES HOTEL WORKERS THOSE KIND OF SITUATIONS WHERE. EMPLOYEES ARE NOT IS CONNECTED TO THE- A WORKPLACE AND THERE WILL WORKING REMOTELY- AND WE DO DO EDUCATION AND OUTREACH BUT WHAT WE FOUND IS- WHEN WE HAVE A COMPLAINT A CERTAIN AREA WHEN WE GO OUT AND TO WITNESS INTERVIEWS- AND MAKE OURSELVES AVAILABLE AND PRESENT- WITHIN A CERTAIN POPULATION. THAT OUR PRESENCE AND PEOPLE WILL LEARN THAT WERE AROUND AND WERE WERE DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT. THANK YOU THANK HER. IT CENTER NIELSEN. DO YOU WITH THE WORK FLOW SO YOU SEE YOUR GETTING MORE COMPLAINTS. AND WHAT DO YOU ATTRIBUTE THAT TO BETTER COMMUNICATION TO THE PEOPLE OF THAT THAT THE HOW TO COMPLAIN OR WHERE TO COMPLAIN OR WHAT WHAT DO YOU ATTRIBUTE THE INCREASING NUMBERS. TO SO IT HAS BEEN INCREASING A YEAR BY YEAR AS I MENTIONED TO AND- I THINK THAT THE MEDIA FOCUS ON- DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES BY EMPLOYERS IT'S BECOME MORE. MORE OKAY TO FILE A DISCRIMINATION CLAIM IF YOUR IF YOU FEEL YOU'VE BEEN DISCRIMINATED UPON AND I THINK PEOPLE IN THE PAST HASN'T TOLD HIS COMFORTABLE COMING FORWARD WITH COMING- WITH THEIR COMPLAINT IN THEIR ALLEGATIONS I THINK IT'S BECOME JUST MORE. COMMON PLACE. AND AS ONE PERSON TALKS ABOUT IT AND SAY HEY YOU KNOW THERE'S THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING THAT CAN HELP YOU IF YOU THINK YOU'VE BEEN DISCRIMINATED UPON ONCE ONE PERSON- COMES FORWARD IT BECOMES A LITTLE BIT MORE OKAY FOR THE NEXT PERSON TO COME FORWARD I THINK THE HOLLYWOOD FOCUS ON THE ME TOO HAS MADE IT MUCH MORE OF PROBABLY PEOPLE ARE HEARING ABOUT IT PEOPLE ARE FEELING A LITTLE BIT MORE COMFORTABLE I WON'T SAY A 100% BUT HAS BECOME A LITTLE BIT MORE COMFORTABLE THEIR STORE. AND THAT THERE'S A PLACE FOR THEM TO FIND IT AVENUE FOR JUSTICE. WELL THERE'S A TREND IN. WHAT SO CALLED CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM NOW THOUGH THAT. IS STIFLING REVEALING CRIMINAL HISTORIES THE YOU SEEN THAT DIMINISH SOME OF THE DEMAND ON YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING AT CRIMINAL HISTORIES WE'VE FOUND THAT THE DEMAND HAS INCREASED IN OUR AGENCY BECAUSE MANY EMPLOYERS ARE NOT FOLLOWING THE RULES THAT THEY NEED TO FOLLOW IN THE EMPLOYMENT PROCESS- MANY TIMES OUR WORK IS EDUCATIONAL TO- HELP EMPLOYERS LEARN WHAT PROCESS THEY SHOULD BE TAKING IN ORDER TO PROPERLY USE SCREEN THEIR APPLICANTS AND NOT. CUT THEM OFF BEFORE THEY'VE HAD A CHANCE TO PROPERLY REVIEW THE PERSON'S APPLICATION THEIR SKILLS AND THEIR ABILITIES AND IF THERE'S THE NEXUS IN THE CONVICTION TO THE EMPLOYMENT THAT THEY'RE SEEKING THEY CAN'T JUST SAY YOU CAN'T WORK. MR SO YOU ACTUALLY DEVOTED SO MUCH TO THIS PROCESS TO MAKE IT CORRECT YES WE HAVE THE STEPS AND WE WORK TO EDUCATE AND MAKE SURE THAT THE EMPLOYER IS. FOLLOWING THE LAW AND THEY HAVE HAD A DISCRIMINATORY CLAIMAGAINST THEM ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO IS ASKTHEY HAVE TO COME TO COMPLIANCE AND WE REVIEWED THEIR PROGRESS AND THEIR PROCESS- AFTER WE COME TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN FOLLOWING IT OKAY AND AS TO YOUR PROCEDURES AND PROTOCOLS FOR PROCESSING. HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING THERE TO PRIORITIZE YOUR PROCESSING OF THESE CLAIMS AND YOU KNOW WITH RESPECT TO BE LESSER IMPORTANT IN THESE ARE MORE IMPORTANT SO DO YOU. DO OUR PRIORITIZE ON THAT BASIS OR SOME KIND OF BASIS. FOR TO DO SO- SO WHEN THEY COME IN WE HAVE AN ATTORNEY THAT DOES SOME PRE CASE GRADING ON THE CASES THEY LOOK THROUGH THE ALLEGATIONS. THOSE THAT I HAVE- ALLEGATIONS OF VIOLENCE OF- YOU KNOW THAT. OKAY THE REAL FACT IF THEY VIOLATED THE ROUTE FACT AND THERE'S HARM THAT THAT HAS BEEN- ALLEGED THOSE PERCOLATE TO THE TOP WE ALSO LOOK OUT SO IT'S A GRADED IT AS A- THREE STAR CASE SO THREE MEANING THE MOST HIGHEST PRIORITY. ZERO MEANING- NOT SO MUCH AND IT GOES UP ACCORDINGLY- AND SO WITH THE EYES ON EACH CASES THAT COME IN AND THEY THEY GRADE IT WE'VE GOT TO FIND IT OUT TO OUR STAFF BASED ON THAT PRIORITY PRE CASE GRADING. THAN THE INITIAL INTERVIEW WITH THE COMPLAINANT PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO SEE IF IT ACTUALLY IT STAYS A THREE STAR OR IF WE- ADJUST THAT DOWN RIGHT AFTER THE FIRST INTERVIEW. SO YES WE DO DO THAT. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU SO IN TERMS OF YOUR INTAKE PROCESS- IS IT DONE ONLINE IS IT IS ALL OF THE INTAKE ONLINE OR IS ARE CAN YOU. YOU CAN CALL AND THEN GET SOMEBODY TO START TAKING AN AN INTAKE FOR YOU. THEY AND THE MOST A PREVALENT THAT PEOPLE A COMPLAINT IS ONLINE WE HAVE AN ONLINE PORTAL IT'S AVAILABLE SO ABOUT- 80% OF OUR CLAIMS COME IN OUT. OF THROUGH THAT CHANNEL. PEOPLE ARE ALSO TIED TO PAPER SO WE DO HAVE A PAPER PROCESS WHERE THEY CAN MAIL IN THEIR- THEIR INTAKE THEIR- ALLEGATIONS TO US FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT ALL TYPES. WE ALSO TAKE THEM OVER THE PHONE. SO WHAT WILL FILL IN THE FORM FOR THEM AS WE TAKE THEIR INTERVIEW AND- THAN THE SIGN THEM UP. INTERVIEW DATE FOR THEIR INTAKE SO DOES THE PORTAL ALLOW- NON ENGLISH SPEAKERS THE ABILITY THAT FILL OUT A FORM YES AND. AND OR IS IT. FOR BALLS ARE LATE IT. ACCESS THE SERVICES AS WELL. COLD BUT I'M MY I'M THINKING THAT THERE MAY BE PEOPLE WHO WELL THERE ARE WORKERS THAT WORKERS AND TENANTS THAT DODD THEY CAN'T READ OR WRITE WELL AND WOULD FEEL INTIMIDATED BY TRYING TO DO SOMETHING ONLINE. SO TO ANSWER THE FIRST PART OF YOUR QUESTION PORTAL IS AVAILABLE. IN A VARIETY OF LANGUAGES SO THEY CLICK ON A LANGUAGE BUTTON AND OUR WHOLE WEB OR HOLE IN STATE. INFORMATION CHANGES. THE PAPER FORMS ARE ALSO IN I THINK. EIGHT DIFFERENT LANGUAGES FOR THEM TO SELECT FROM BUT AS FAR AS THE LITERACY- I MYSELF AND TAKE CAN A- COMPLAINS INFORMATION VERBALLY. AND TRANSLATED THAT TO A FORM WE ALLOW FOR THEM TO COME INTO OUR FOR PUBLIC OFFICES WE HAVE FIVE. OFFICES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA- IS SO WILL EITHER TAKE IT VERBALLY ON THE PHONE OR WE WILL- TO AN IN PERSON INTAKE- IF THEY COME INTO OUR OFFICES. OKAY AND THEN- THIS THAT THIS FUNDING IS SIGNIFICANTLY- YEAH IT'S LARGE IT'S LAW I AND FOUND IT 222% STAFFING INCREASE AND SO- WHAT'S THE PLAN FOR FILLING VACANT ASSUMING YOU GET- FUNDED. WHAT'S THE PLAN FOR FILLING THESE POSITIONS AND- AND THE DECISION FOR WHERE WOULD THEY GO AND WHAT KIND OF CASES WITH THEY DO SO. THE PLAN FOR HIRING IS OUR PLAN IS TO ADVERTISE THE POSITIONS- AS A PENDING BUDGET APPROVAL SO THAT WE CAN GET A HEAD START ON IT- THAT WAY WE CAN SCREEN THE APPLICANTS WE FORM THE INTERVIEWS AND THEN BRING THEM ALL ON BOARD AS QUICKLY AS WE POSSIBLY CAN DEPENDING OUR OUR BUDGET APPROVAL IF THIS MOVES FORWARD. WE HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE FOR GROUP TRAINING FOR INVESTIGATION AND ATTORNEY STAFF WE HAVE ALREADY- AN ONLINE AND A IN PERSON TRAINING. COURSE DEVELOPED SO THAT IS NOT NEW ITS ALREADY TO ROLL OUT WE'VE USED IT FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS NOW- AS FAR AS WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO GO- THEY'RE GOING TO BE FILLED IN THE AREAS WHERE AT THE HIGHEST NEED AS THE LOS ANGELES. SACRAMENTO ARE OUR HIGHEST IN OUR IN THE BAY AREA IT'S OUR WHERE WE PLAN ON FILLING. OKAY AND THEN FROM THE OF THOSE FIVE OFFICES ARE THEY ALL LOCATED IN BIGGER URBAN CENTERS. YES YES THEY ARE OKAY- WHAT I THINK WOULD BE REAL HELPFUL IS JUST- I'M A VISUAL PERSON I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THE COMMENTS MADE- IN REGARDS TO- TE INCREASE IN- THE TYPES OF CASES THAT YOU'RE SEEING. WHAT WOULD BE GREAT IS JUST IT. UP A GRAPH THAT SAYS THE BILL IN THE PAST TEN YEARS HERE'S BEEN THE INCREASE- ARE OUT OF ORDER OR HERE'S THE NUMBERS RIGHT- JUST SO WE CAN GET IS A SENSE OF. WHERE WHAT KIND OF CASES YOU'RE YOU'VE BEEN LOOK. AND A LOT OF THESE HAVE TO DO WITH CHANGES IN THE LOS. AND IF NOT CHANGES AT LEAST FROM A RECOGNITION THAT THESE ARE NO LONGER. WELL RECOGNITION AND THAT PUBLIC RECOGNITION RIGHT- IN PARTICULAR THAT- THE ME TOO MOVEMENT- I WOULD EXPECT TO SEE IT A SPIKE IN. IN CONCERN AND QUESTIONS AND DATA QUITE FRANKLY SO- THEN SO I APPRECIATE THAT. ON THE RECOMMENDATION ON THIS I BELIEVE IS TO HOLD OVER AS WELL SO WELL HOLD IT OPEN SO WE'LL DO THAT AND I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY. CHECK TO SEE A ONE MORE CENTER DRESS AS STRICT QUESTION A NEW ISSUE WAS BROUGHT UP TO ARE SO. OF SCHEDULING THE LENGTH OF TIME AND THAT'S WHAT I HOPE YOU'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THE LENGTH OF TIME- TO SCHEDULE PHONE CALL OF BUT THAT THE EMPLOYER RESPONSES ARE VERBAL SO THEY'RE NOT GIVEN IN WRITING. OF THAT THAT HAS BECOME A BIG ISSUE. WE WILL NOT SEND DMV H. WON'T SEND EMPLOYER RESPONSES AND LIGHTING. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S ABOUT SO FINE AND UNDERSTANDING AND LET ME JUST MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE QUESTION IS SO- WHEN WE ACCEPT AN ALLEGATION AND FILE A FORMAL COMPLAINT WE SEND A LIST OF QUESTIONS IN WRITING TO THE RESPONDENT FOR THEM TO RESPOND TO. AND THAT'S AFTER WE HAVE. INTERVIEWED THE COMPLAINANT RECEIVE THEIR INFORMATION WE COME UP WITH A SET OF SPECIALIZED QUESTIONS THAT WE WANT TO ASK THE RESPONDENT- IN THERE DAVE SOME THOSE BACK IN WRITING TO US- SO IS THAT THAT QUESTION THAT'S NOT PROVIDED. CHOOSE THE PLAN ELEMENT THAT THE IT'S ONLY PROVIDER VERBALLY. THAT IS CORRECT WE DO TELL THE WE DON'T SHARE ALL THE DETAILS OF THE RESPONDENTS- ANSWERS TO THE COMPLAINANT. CAN YOU. EXPLAIN WHY I'M GONNA HAVE TO GET BACK TO WORK OUT BECAUSE I THINK THERE WAS SOME LEGAL- SPECIFICS IN WHAT WE CAN AND CAN'T PROVIDE TO THE COMPLAINANT ON THE INFORMATION THAT WE RECEIVED FROM THE RESPONDENT SO IF I CAN GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT I'D APPRECIATE IT. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU. VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THIS ONE RIGHT HERE THANK YOU VERY WORK. AND THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER NINE WHICH IS THE UPDATE ON IMPLEMENTATION OF REGION RECENT LEGISLATION AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES. WELCOME TO OKAY. FORTY MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS RUSS FONG OF THE DEPUTY RECTOR FOR ADMINISTRATION FOR THE HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY TO GIVE US LET US TO GIVE AN UPDATE ON WHAT'S GOING ON WITH OUR DEPARTMENT INSPECTION ADMINISTRATIVE SITE ON MY LEFT I HAVE JENNIFER SEGER SHE'S OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE DIVISION OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND SHOULD BE COVERING ARE NOTICE OF MANTA AVAILABILITY WE SEQUENCING. AND TODAY I'M GONNA START OFF WITH OUR VACANCY RATE SOME OF IMPROVEMENTS WE'VE MADE IN RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THAT I LIKE TO START VERY GOOD. AND PLEASE DO. FIRST I WANTED TO PAINT A PICTURE OF OUR VACANCY RATE AND KIND OF WHY WE'RE HERE- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT KIND OF THE RAPID GROWTH THAT IT DEPARTMENTS HAD. OVER THE RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME SO IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE FIVE YEAR. I'M GROWTH PERIOD WE HAD ACCELERATED RATE OF GROWTH ON BOTH POSITIONS BUT ALSO FINDING. OUT WE WENT FROM FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT POSITIONS FIVE YEARS AGO TWO EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO WHICH REPRESENTS A FIFTY. 51% INCREASE. JUST POSITIONS ALONE. OUR FIRST YEAR WE HAD ABOUT A- UP 224% 4% SO THERE'S BEEN DRAMATIC INCREASES OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. BUT DURING THAT TIME OPPOSITE OPERATIONS ALSO. I WE WENT FOR ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR STATE OPERATIONS TO A AN ORGANIZATION THAT'S A HUNDRED THIRTY NINE DOLLARS- SO THAT REPRESENTS ABOUT A 75% INCREASE DURING THAT SAME PERIOD OF TIME. TAKE A LOOK AT OUR OUR OVERALL WE GIVE TO OUR CITIES AND COUNTIES- THAT'S GROWN 71% DURING THE SAME TIME WE WENT FROM NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE MILLION. TO ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. SO YOU TAKE A LOOK AT OUR TOTAL BUDGET- WE WENT FROM ONE BILLION TO ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS- WHICH REPRESENTS THE BOTTOM. SO 1% INCREASE WITHIN THAT PERIOD OF THE FIVE YEARS SO. I KIND OF PAINTS A PICTURE WHERE WE ARE AND WHILE WE'RE SITTING HERE TODAY- I LIKE TO MOVE OR TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE VACANCY RATE- I JUST WANTED TO INFORM. THE VACANCY RATE REALLY IS A FACTOR OF TWO THINGS IT'S HOW MANY POSITIONS YOU'RE HIRING. BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES HOW MANY POSITION YOU'RE LOSING FOR VARIOUS REASONS- THOSE REASONS COULD BE RETIREMENTS- DESKS UNFORTUNATELY HAD A FEW FOLKS PASSED AWAY THIS PAST YEAR- REJECTIONS ON PROBATION SO. LEFT STATE SERVICE OR LEFT NO DEPARTMENT EITHER FOR LATERAL OR PROMOTION. SO DOES INCLUDE THAT SO WE KEEP THAT IN MIND AS WE DO TALK ABOUT OUR VACANCY RATES. I'M TAKE A SNAPSHOT LAST TWO YEARS. AND IF YOU LOOK AT FEBRUARY OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TO FIT EVERY OF TWO THOUSAND. MONEY ARE. REALLY FLUCTUATED EARLY ON AROUND JULY AND NUMBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE HAVE OVER 30% CAN SEE RAY. HAS CONSISTENTLY DONE NOW. BUT IF BACK TO DECEMBER OF THOUSAND EIGHT. AS TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AVERAGE DROP ABOUT TWO FOUR HOURS. I'M WITH THE DRAW IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS AND CAN APPROVE THAT IF YOU LOOK AT OUR JANUARY TWENTY VACANCY RATE IT'S WE REPORTED. PERCENT DISAGREEMENT ON ALL TIME LOW- IF YOU LOOK AT FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY. 18% AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE FOR OTHER DEPARTMENTS AS HOVERS AROUND- 12214% SO WE'RE GETTING REALLY CLOSE- TO WHAT I WOULD SAY THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE RATHER DEPARTMENTS- WE ACTUALLY HIRED ACTUALLY DURING THIS TWO YEAR PERIOD TWO HUNDRED NINETY NEW POSITIONS. SO THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY FOUR NEW POSITIONS PER MONTH- THE CHALLENGE TO THE VACANCY RATE THOUGH AT THAT SAME TIME WE HAD ABOUT NINETY EIGHT POSITIONS THAT OUR OUR INDIVIDUALS THAT LEFT FOR VARIOUS REASONS. ALL THE VAST MAJORITY ABOUT 70% READ RETIREMENTS OR FOLKS AT LEFT FOR PROMOTIONS AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS SO WE KIND OF BOUNCE THAT OUT BUT WE DID LIKE I SAID A HARD A MASS AMOUNT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY FOLKS BUT WE AVERAGE ABOUT TWENTY FOUR NEW POSITIONS A MONTH. SWITCH OVER THE LIMIT TO THE CHALLENGES FACED EARLIER ON WE'RE VERY A LITTLE UNIQUE FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS. A ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES IS. A CHALLENGES AT LEAST HOW IT IMPACTS OUR VACANCY RATE IS WE HAVE. 48% OF OUR POSITIONS DEPARTMENT WIDE. THAT WE CALLED DEPARTMENT SPECIFIC CLASSIFICATIONS IN OTHER WORDS THESE POSITIONS ONLY EXISTS OF HOUSING COMMITTEE DEVELOPMENT. AND SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THERE THE PERKS OF IT IS IT PAYS ABOUT 5% ON AVERAGE TO ITS COUNTERPART. I'M MORE MONEY THAN POSITIONS OF EQUAL ABOUT EQUAL TO JOBS BUT- DUTIES. FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS. BUT IT ALSO REQUIRES HOUSING EXPERIENCE. AND BECAUSE OF THE HOUSING EXPERIENCE IS A LITTLE MORE CHALLENGING TO FIND FOLKS THAT CAN. QUALIFY FOR THOSE TYPES OF POSITIONS. I'M ANOTHER CHALLENGE IS WE'VE HAD-AN UNUSUAL AMOUNT OF TRYING TO PROMOTE. SO NOW AN INCREDIBLE SHOULDN'T MEANS IF I AM. AMERICA IF I'M GONNA CURRENT AND I FOR NEXT JOB I GET THE PROMOTE. AND WE STILL BACK FOR MY POSITION THAT. REALLY IMPACT THE VACANCY WE USUALLY A HEART A LARGE AMOUNT DEPARTMENT WIDE WE HAD ABOUT THIRTY NINE PERCENT. OF OUR OF OUR PROMOTIONS SO THAT TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY HUNDRED THIRTEEN OF ALL MORE INTERNAL PROMOTION THAT'S QUITE A BIT. SO ALTHOUGH WE'RE PROMOTING FOLKS IN PLACE WHICH IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING FOR STAFF. IT DOESN'T IMPACT OF A RATE AS YOU'D WANTED TO. THE OTHER PART AND IF YOU LOOK AT JENNIFER IS VERY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WHICH ACTUALLY ISSUES ARE GRANTS AND LOANS- THERE AT FORTY SEVEN PERCENT. OR INTERNAL PROMOTIONS SO THAT'S FIFTY FOUR PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY WERE PROMOTED IN PLACE. ALTHOUGH THE KIND OF THE CHALLENGES WHEN YOU LOOK AT HER CONCERT. OKAY THE HOT PEOPLE ACTUALLY BRING AN END. BUT MORE POORLY LIKE TO. CHANGE ON SO WHAT'S CHANGED WILL BE DONE TO ACTUALLY REDUCE DRAKE IS HERE AND I WOULD LIKE TO. POINT OUT A FEW. ONE OF THEM IS CENTRALIZED OR HR FUNDS. BASICALLY WHAT THAT DOES IS THINGS ONE ALLOWS THE PROBE MANAGER TO FOCUS THEIR DATA. THERE'S A LOT LESS FOR THEM TO DO TODAY THAN IT WAS IN THE PAST- SO OUR HR SHOP IS NOW FULLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE RECRUITMENT PROCESS- DOES THAT IMPACTED APARTMENT YES- WE IMPLEMENT THIS A BACK IN. JULY OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- BEFORE THAT THE YEAR BEFORE. THE AVERAGE TIME IT WOULD TAKE FOR RECRUITMENT AND RECRUITMENT STARTS FROM THE ORIGINAL POST DATE. THE DATE THE EMPLOYEE STARTS. WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED IN NINETEEN DAYS. SO EACH FOR EACH- RECRUITMENT TOOK ABOUT A HUNDRED IN NINEEEN DAYS BEFORE THE CENTRALIZATION. ST STE- JULY OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE REDUCE THAT TO SEVENTY FOUR DAYS. SO THAT'S ABOUT A 38% DECREASE. AND AS OUR HR SHOP. GETS MORE CUSTOM TO THAT I ANTICIPATE THAT PERCENTAGE EVEN DROPPING MORE. SO THAT WAS BEEN A BIG FACTOR TRYING TO GET FOLKS ON QUICKER IS THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO ACTUALLY RECRUIT A POSITION. ANOTHER BIG THING IS WE STREAMLINED OUR ONBOARDING PROCESS SO ONCE WE HAVE THE EMPLOYEE HARD HOW WE GET THEM ON BOARD AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. I'LL BE CREATED WHAT'S CALLED A ONE TOUCH PROCESS WHERE. BUT ONCE THE ONCE HR GETS A START DATE OF A NEW EMPLOYEE. EVERYTHING ELSE IS TAKING CARE OF SO IN OTHER WORDS THERE THEIR CUBICLE SPACE THERE AND- ON. IT EQUIPMENT PHONES CHAIRS. OFFICE SUPPLIES EVERYTHING PHONE NUMBERS EVERYTHING IS TAKEN CARE OF FOR THEM SO BY THE TIME THEY HIT. WHERE THEY ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY STARTED HIGH HOUSING. ELEMENT ALL THEIR SUPPLIES ARE READY TO GO. SO IT'S ALSO MUCH AMOS IT'S PRETTY IT'S PRETTY SELF SUFFICIENT- BUT IT ALSO GETS EMPLOYED TO START TO BE EFFECTIVE FROM DAY ONE. ANOTHER THING WE'VE DONE IS- WE HARDLY BUT I DID BRING IN TWO HR CONSULTANTS- BOTH. HAVE ABOUT THE OVER SIXTY YEARS OF AGE OUR EXPERIENCE ONE OF ALMOST THE FORMER. DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. AND THEY'VE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN TRYING TO GO IN THERE AND KIND OF HELP US STREAMLINE OUR CURRENT RECRUITMENT PROCESSES AND GIVE US BETTER IDEAS ON HOW WE CAN LOWER VACANCY RATE WE'VE- WE DID A JOB FAIR THAT WAS TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL- BACK IN NOVEMBER OF TWO OF. TWO NOVEMBER TWENTY THIRD WE HAVE AND ALL DAY SATURDAY JOB FAIR FROM FOUR THIRTY TO EIGHT THIRTY- WE HAD TWENTY SOME POSITIONS ALL IN JENNIFER'S AREA THE KEY HOUSING POSITIONS. AND WE HAD OVER FIVE HUNDRED APPLICANTS AND APPLICANTS CAN GO ONLINE TAKE THE EXAMPLE QUALIFY. ONE HUNDRED OF THOSE. AND OF THE HUNDRED OF THE HUNDRED THAT WE INTERVIEWED WE ACTUALLY ENDED UP FILLING ALL TWENTY SEVEN POSITIONS. WE ACTUALLY MAY TWENTY WE ACTUALLY MAY TWENTY TENTATIVE OFFERS TODAY OF THAT SATURDAY. SO WE DO PLAN ON DOING ONE MORE WE HAVE ANOTHER ONE COMING OUT WITH A LOVE IN A KEY POSITIONS AND JENNIFER'S AREA- BUT THAT WAS A HUGE SUCCESS WAS A LOT OF WORK BUT I THINK WE GOT PRETTY GOOD. LEARNED A LOT YOU KNOW LEARN WHAT TO DO WHAT NOT TO DO NEXT TIME- BUT I THINK THAT'S GONNA BE A HUGE PART OF KEEPING OUR VACANCY RATE DOWN AS A JOB FAIR AND IT WAS HOUSING A HEADQUARTERS IN STOCK. ALSO WAS PRETTY CONVENIENT THE- OTHER THING IS JUST ADVERTISING. WE'VE BEEN VERY AGGRESSIVE OF THE LAST FEW MONTHS AN ADVERTISING WE HAVE USE LINKEDIN. ON OUR WEBSITE WHICH AGAIN PRETTY SUCCSSFUL- WE ACTUALLY MARKET VIEW CPS- CONSULTING FIRM TO ACTUALLY HELP US MARKET TO. COUNTIES AND CITIES NON PROFITS- BANKS. EXPRESSION THE MORTGAGE AREAS- STAFF CURRENTLY GIVE OUT FLYERS EVERY TIME THEY DO OUT REACH COMMITTEE MEETINGS- EVERY TIME WE GO OUT AND DO- ANY TYPE OUT REACHER CONFERENCES WE DO ADVERTISE OUR POSITIONS SO WE DO HAVE A PRETTY AGGRESSIVE PLAN. FOR ACTUALLY ADVERTISED. POSITIONS THAT'S BEEN REAL EFFECTIVELY ACTUALLY OF EMPLOYEES THAT BELONG TO A LOT OF. PERSONAL BLOG A LOT OF. HOUSING RELATED. CLUBS THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A CHOICE TO. AND WE FOUND THAT JUST HAVE AN ARM POISE ADVERTISE. YOU KNOW HOW. SOME OF THE- OFFICE OF WORK IN OUR DEPARTMENT. HAS BEEN A HUGE SUCCESS. I DON'T FIND. WE'RE TRACKING YOU KNOW I THINK THE KEY OF PERFORMANCES LIKE YOU SAID EARLIER TODAY IS WE TRACK EVERYTHING RECRUITMENT NOW IF YOU LOVE MAKE CRITICISM CHARTS WE HAVE PLAYED. WE KNOW WHERE EVERY SINGLE RECRUITMENT HAPPENING NOW AND IF THERE'S pA MEDICATED INSTANTLY- WITHOUT AND THEN FINALLY I WOULD SAY WERE ADDING ACTUALLY SEE A POSITION THAT'S OVERREACH OUR SHOP. THAT I GET THE EXTRA LAYER OF ATTENTION THAT THIS DEPARTMENT WILL NEED AS IT GROWS LARGER. WITH THAT IF- BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR IF. AND TRY TO IDENTIFY. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS JENNIFER SEEKER AND THE ACTING DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE DIVISION OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND SPEAK TO THE RECENT EFFORTS THAT WE'VE UNDERTAKEN TO KIND OF STREAMLINED SOME OF OUR INTERNAL PROCESS SEES AND HOW THAT'S REALLY IMPACTING AND DISTRIBUTION OF- CRITICAL HOUSING PROGRAM FUNDS SAID SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE DEPARTMENT IS REALLY WORKED. GRAMS WILL CONTINUING TO EXIST TO IMPLEMENT OUR EXISTING PROGRAMS AND PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE DEPARTMENT'S DIVISION OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WAS IMPLEMENTING IT APPROXIMATELY SEVEN PROGRAMS. AND THAT NUMBER OF PROGRAMS HAS INCREASED TO TWENTY TWO ACTIVE STATE AND FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAMS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. AND THAT REPRESENTS AN INCREASE OF ABOUT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW FUNDING. AS SINCE JANUARY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE DEPARTMENT HAS AWARDED APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS AT STATE AND FEDERAL HOUSING. AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM FUNDS. HOWEVER IN OCTOBER EARLY OCTOBER OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE DID ANNOUNCE A. FOR THE MONTH OF OCTOBER THROUGH DECEMBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN AND EXCEPT FOR THOSE PROGRAMS TO RE HAD EXTERNAL OUR PARTNERSHIP COMMITMENTS OR AND- STRICT. ENCUMBRANCE OR DISBURSEMENT DEADLINES SO IMPACTED SIX OF OUR PROGRAMS DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD. AND THE DIVISION REALLY FOCUSED ON RE ENGINEERING OR INTERNAL PROCESS SEES TO EFFICIENTLY MAKE AWARDS AND DISPERSE FUNDS SO THIS INCLUDED- VARIETY OF DIFFERENT EFFORTS AND BUT SOME OF THOSE INCLUDED BUSINESS PROCESS IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS TO STREAMLINE OUR STAND AGREEMENT. A DEVELOPMENT AND EXECUTION PROCESS SEES SO ONCE WE MAKE AWARD ENSURING THAT THE STANDARD CREAM IT'S ARE EXECUTED OVER GETTING THE MONEY INTO THE PROJECTS AND ON THE STREETS TO HAVE AN IMPACT IT'S AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I'M WE ALSO LOOKED AT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS FOR STREAMLINED APPLICATION SAID MIDDLE SO ALSO FROM A CUSTOMER SPURS PERSPECTIVE STREAMLINING THEIR APPLICATION PROCESS BUT ALSO HELPING US TO ACT BY OUR REVIEW. OF SUBMITTED DOCUMENTS AND WE ALSO WENT THROUGH AN ORGANIZATIONAL RESTRUCTURING DURING THAT TIME FOR TO BETTER ALIGN OUR EXISTING RESOURCES WITH WORKLOAD NEED. WITH CREATE THAN PROGRAMS IS THINGS WERE NECESSARILY ALLOCATE OUR RESOURCES FOR NECESSARY ALLOCATED TO IN THE RIGHT PLACES SO WE WORK THROUGH OUR NATIONAL REDESIGNED ARCHER TO BETTER ALIGN NOW. I'M THREE IS AN EXPEDITED TREATMENT IN HIRING MANY OF THE THINGS THAT REST MENTIONED ARE HIRING FAIR WAS A GREAT SUCCESS. AND THEN WE ALSO REALLY FOCUSED ON STAFF TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT OF THOSE RECENTLY AIRED FOLKS AND WE PUTTING TOGETHER A FORMALIZED ONBOARDING- AND PROGRAM AND ALSO DEPLOY IN A- AN IN HOUSE TRAINING PROGRAMS. TO BRING NEW STAFF WHO MAY NOT COME WITH HOUSING EXPERTISE RIGHT BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE HIRING SO MANY FOLKS AND YOU CAN'T GET EVERYONE THE HOUSE AND HOUSING EXPERTISE SO WE DEVELOPED IN HOUSE TRAINING PROGRAM THAT ALLOWED US TO TAKE THESE NEW FOLKS. SO THE WHOLE GOAL OF THIS NEVER RECEIVED WHEN SEEM PLAN WAS REALLY TO AND- DELIVER UPON SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS THE FIRST OF THOSE BEING THAT WE WANT TO MEET PUBLISHED. THERE IS A PENDING AVAILABILITY DATES WE HAVE ENOUGH AYE CALENDAR THAT'S PUBLIC ON AND PUBLISHED ON OUR WEBSITE I THINK YOU HAVE A COPY IT OF IN YOUR AGENDA SO WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WHEN WE SAY WE'RE GOING TO RELEASE ENOUGH IN JANUARY. WE ISSUE THAT NO FAT IN JANUARY BECAUSE FOLKS ARE. RELYING ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THOSE PLANS WHEN THEY'RE PUTTING TOGETHER THESE REALLY COMPLICATED PROJECTS AND THE SECOND WAS STANDARD AGREEMENT WHETHER PLATES WE WENT TO HAVE THOSE UP IN AVAILABLE AND AT THE TIME OF A WARD SO THAT. THE FOLKS THAT ARE GETTING THESE FUNDS CAN LOOK AT THE STANDARD AGREEMENTS. AND START TO REVIEW THOSE WELL WE'RE HEARING THOSE IN HOUSE WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF HAVING SCARED CREAM AND ROUTE SO WHAT EASE WITHIN THE DAY AWARD. SO THOSE WERE. DOES GOALS WITHIN THE REGION HERE PROCESS THESE THE ORGANIZATIONAL RESTRUCTURING AND TRADE IN THE IN THE FRONT THE BILL PLEASE THE AWARD AND JUST TO PRESS. HOW BECOME QUICKER. MORE EFFICIENT AND IN FACT SINCE THE LAUNCH OF OUR RE SEQUENCING PLANNED THE DEPARTMENT HAS ISSUED EIGHT NOTICES A FUNNY AVAILABILITY. ALL BY THE PROJECTED DATE CENTER NOW IF I CALENDAR AND SIX OF NOVAS THAT WERE RE SEQUENCE DEAN BUT- THAT WERE ORIGINALLY RE SEQUENCED THREE OF THOSE PROGRAMS UP AND THAT IS THE FUNNY AVAILABILITY HAS BEEN RELEASED. WITH AT LEAST THE CAL HOME PROGRAM IN NOVEMBER. THE JOE STERN A FARM WORKER GRANT PROGRAM THAT WAS RELEASED IN DECEMBER AND THEN I'M AT LOCAL HAPPY NO OCCASION PROGRAM WHICH IS THE SEVENTY SEVENTY CENT OF LOCAL IS. THERE A TO THE BUILDING HOMES AND POPS TAUGHT ACTIVITIES SEVENTEEN THAT WAS IT IN FEBRUARY THE REMAINING. THREE NOW IS THAT WERE RE RE SEQUENCED THOSE TRAPPED THE ISSUE WITHIN THE- THAT'S- GOOD FOR ALL. WILL HAVE. NO IF ISSUE IN STATES THAT WERE PAUSED FOR A THREE MONTH PERIOD. IT ALLOWED US TO RE WORK IN RE ENGINEER SOME OF OUR INTERNAL PROCESS SEES. AND THE RESULT IS THAT AWARDS ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE MADE SOONER THAN THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN. UNDER IF WE HAD NOT PROCEEDED WITH ENOUGH EVERY SEQUENCING PLANNED. FOR EXAMPLE AND- ARE CAL HOME PROGRAM THAT WAS ONE OF THE SIX PROGRAMS THAT WAS RE SEQUENCED. IT WAS ORIGINALLY PLANNED TO BE RELEASED IN SEPTEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. AM WITH AWARDS ANTICIPATED A MARCH TWENTY TWENTY. AM BUT EACH SEAT WAS TYPICALLY RUNNING BETWEEN FIFTY AND A HUNDRED DAYS BEHIND. THE AWARD DATE THAT WE HAD PUBLISHED INTERNET CALENDAR. AND WE WOULD HAVE MEANT IF WE ISSUED THAT IN SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WITHOUT TAKE. AND WITHOUT THE RE ENGINEER PROCESS SEES INTERNALLY. AND THOSE AWARDS WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE PROBABLY AND LET AND EARLY JUNE- LATE JUNE EARLY JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY. WE RE SEQUENCE THAT NO FAT. FOR NOVEMBER IT WAS RELEASED NOVEMBER TWENTY SEVENTH WITH AWARDS ANTICIPATED IN MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY. WE'RE ON TRACK TO. MAY TWENTY TWENTY DEADLINE WHICH IS REALLY FORTY FIVE DAYS EARLIER THAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN RELEASED HAD WE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. TO GO IN SEASON OFFICE AND FOCUS ON STREAMLINING INTERNAL PROCESSES. AND SO. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY. YOU MAY HAVE BUT I THINK IT HAS BEEN A AT A POSITIVE DIRECTION FOR THE APARTMENT AND IT'S ALLOWING US TO. DEFINITELY MORE EFFICIENTLY I'M AN EXPEDITION LEE DELIVER- THESE CRITICAL RESOURCES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS IS A- OVERSIGHT ITEM WEREN'T NO ACTION IS REQUIRED- BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR- PRESENTATION YOU'RE SPEAKING. MY LANGUAGE STANDARDIZED RE ENGINEERED STREAMLINED AND EXPEDITING- AND I THINK IT HELPS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT I'VE HEARD FROM THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY- IN REGARDS TO- APPLICATIONS THEY HAVE EITHER PENDING OR THAT THEY RECEIVED IN. THE FACT THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT STANDARDIZED AGREEMENTS MORE RECENTLY AS YESTERDAY THAT WAS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE IT WAS RAISED WITH ME- SO I REALLY APPRECIATE- ANY QUESTIONS. YES SENATOR A LOT IS IN PROCESS AND A LOT MORE THE- FOURTH COMING THIS YEAR. IF COMMENTED ABOUT HOW DIFFERENT LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS OF EXPEDITE. HAVE EXACERBATED YOUR WORKLOAD. AB COULD YOU HAVE DEVELOPED A PROCESSOR WAY TO MORE REGULARLY A PRICE THE COMMITTEE OF HOW YOUR FROM PROCEEDING WITH SO WE CAN BE BETTER ASSESSING AND NOT HAVING THAT BIG BIG BUILD UP OR A DELAY OF MONEY'S GOING OUT- THAT'S A SO THAT'S IT'S BEEN AN ONGOING PROBLEM AND I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING ON IT BUT WHAT I'M LOOKING AT IS NOT JUST WAITING TILL NEXT YEAR TO GET UPDATED AS YOU'RE DOING HERE FOR US TODAY BUT RATHER SOMEWHERE IN THE INTERIM THAT WE GET MORE REGULAR REPORTS DO YOU DO THAT- CAN YOU DO THAT. WOULD YOU PUBLISH SOME INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE IT'S AN- NOTE M. AWARDS ARE MADE BUT I THINK WE CAN DEFINITELY. AND PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER AND PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO YOU JUST KIND OF. I'M WORKING WITH YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN AND HOW WE CAN PROVIDE THAT DATA FOR I'D LIKE TO WORK EARLY ON THAT MAYBE SOME LITTLE LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET THEN. OKAY FORCE REPORTING CONTROL LANGUAGE THANK YOU. GOOD CENTER DROSS OF YEAH. SINCE I'M IN THE PROCESS STILL OF LEARNING. ON ALL THESE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND THERE'S MORE IN A RECESSION. WHAT SENATE GE OF. WHAT DID YOU DO IS IN THIS MAY BE DIFFICULT TO BREAK DOWN IS- GOING TO ARE HOMELESS. PROGRAMS IS THEIR WAY OF. GETTING AT THAT A LITTLE BIT I GUESS WHAT I'M GETTING THAT'S NOT A TRICK QUESTION IS- AS YOU GO THROUGH THESE MOMENTS OF. YOU KNOW NOT HAVING THE STAFF FILLING VACANCIES IS. HOW DO YOU PRIORITIZE CD IS IT A PRIORITY HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH SO MANY PROGRAMS THAT ARE TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF OUR HOUSING CRISIS SO I WOULD SAY WE ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS ON A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT FRONTS WE HAVE THE PROGRAMS WHICH ARE AND WITHIN THE DIVISION OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE SO THAT INCLUDES ARE NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROGRAM ARE VETERANS HOMELESSNESS. AND HOUSING PREVENTION PROGRAM WE ALSO RECENTLY FINISHED UP THE CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS FOR HOUSING PROGRAM THAT WAS. AND WHICH WE'VE NOW ALL ALLOCATED AND SO. WE CONTINUE TO ROLL THROUGH THOSE PROGRAMS WERE ISSUING ANYONE KNOW FIRST FOUR FULL FOR NO PLACE LIKE HOME AND THE VETERANS HOUSING. AND PROGRAM- MOST RECENTLY RELEASED I THINK IN THE LAST TWO TO THREE MONTHS WE'VE APPLICATIONS IN THE HOUSE SO THAT'S ON AN ANNUAL CALENDAR EYES BASIS FOR ISSUING OFFICE BUT SOCK IN HIS TEAM AND HOUSING. AND POLICY DEVELOPMENT DIVISION ALSO HAVE A ROLE IN HOMELESSNESS SO IF YOU HAVE YOU HAVE A NO FOR COUNTY FROM YOU MAYBE TO ADD A LITTLE POINT TO THAT SO. THE SECOND LINE ITEM V. EIGHT EIGHT FIFTY THAT'S SPECIFIC TO HOMELESS VETERANS AND LOW INCOME VETERANS TO FOR EXAMPLE YOU'LL FEEL A LOT OF WILL NOT 100% ALWAYS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THAT FUNDING. GOING TOWARD HOMELESS VETERANS WE HAVE SOME SPECIFIC PROGRAMS TARGET TO SPECIFIC SEGMENTS OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION THAT'S ONE OF THEM. NO PLACE LIKE HOME WAS MENTIONED THAT SPECIFIC OF COURSE TO CHRONICALLY HOMELESS FOLKS WHO ALSO EXPERIENCING MENTAL ILLNESS- IF YOU GO DOWN A LITTLE BIT LOWER FOR THROUGH THE BOTTOM WE C. H. H. C. THAT IS FEDERAL FUNDS WE GET FOR. LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ONE NATURAL IT SERVICE CALL THE FOLKS WHO ARE CURRENTLY WAS. THE LEASE PROGRAM. BILL ALMOST. ALL OF PROGRAMS YOU DO BETTER IF YOU'RE- THE DEEP A LOWER IN LEVEL OR SERVING HER FOLKS EVEN IT'S NOT A REQUIREMENT. OF THAT BRING SO EVEN OUR- PROGRAM THE BIGGEST PROGRAM THE MULTI FAMILY HOUSING PROGRAM THE RECENT AWARDS WE ISSUED THERE ARE QUITE A FEW PROJECTS ARE FOR PERMITS SUPPORTER HOUSING. EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A LOT OF IN THE HOUSING PROGRAM. THEY WERE SERVING HOMELESS SUCKS SO EVEN THOUGH. THE MATH IS A LITTLE ROUGH RIGHT WE HAVE SPECIFIC PROGRAMS THAT. TOTALLY JUST GO TO FROM WAS HOME WITH US BUT EVEN WITHIN THE OTHER PROGRAMS. WE OFTEN. THEY ALMOST ALWAYS THESE DAYS YOU'RE GONNA SEE AT LEAST A HANDFUL OF NOT HALF OF THOSE AWARDS FEATURING. SOME SEGMENT HOMELESS POPULATION IT'S- MAYBE NOT A 100% OF THAT PRODUCT HISTORY FOLKS OR HOMELESS IT MIGHT BE. 30% OF THOSE UNITS A TARGET. PEOPLE HOMELESS THE OTHER. YOU KNOW PERCENTAGES ARE AT PEOPLE AT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THEY CAN BE QUITE QUITE COMPLEX BUT WE HAVE BUILT IN. WI SAFE FROM POLICY PERSPECTIVE AN ADVANTAGE TO DEVELOPERS IF THEY ARE CHOOSING TO SERVE IN THEIR APPLICATIONS EVEN FOR THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY TARGET. ASSIST IF THEY'RE DOING SO. NOW WE CAN GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL BUT IT IT'S A ON A PROJECT UBER PROJECT LEVEL. IT CAN BE COMPLICATED RIGHT BECAUSE EVERY PROJECT CAN BE. EVEN WITH EVERYTHING. THANK YOU I JUST WANT GOING BACK TO THE STAFFING- IF. YOU WENT THROUGH THE RECRUITMENT- HIGHER RAIN AND THE START DATE. COULD YOU JUST QUICKLY SAME THING ABOUT THE RETENTION. SINCE THE PROCESS. IS YOU'RE TRYING TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS WHICH I REALLY APPRECIATE. BUT SOMETIMES THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN YOU KEEP EVERYBODY. ACHY AND RETENTION IS KEY BECAUSE IT IMPACTS THE VACANCY RATE AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER. SO SOME THINGS ARE DOING IS WE DO HAVE A NEW EMPLOYEE- A NEW EMPLOYEE ORIENTATION PROGRAM THAT. EVERY SINGLE EMPLOYEE THAT'S NEW TO HOUSING COMMITTEE OF ELEMENT DOES IT DOES HAVE TO TEN. AND ACTUALLY I'VE BEEN AROUND STATE SERVICE FOR NINETEEN YEARS AS BY THE BEST PROGRAM I'VE EVER SEEN AS FAR AS TRYING TO KEEP. FOLKS ON BOARDED- WE HAD AN UNUSUALLY LARGE AMOUNT OF FOLKS THAT RETIRED LAST YEAR- I WOULD SAY ONE THIRD OVER DEPARTMENT ARE FOLKS THAT HAVE BEEN THERE FOR FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS OR MORE- AND THEN YOU GOT LIKE TWO THIRDS. RELATIVELY BRAND NEW AND SO I ANTICIPATE THE VACANCY RATE PART OF HOW IT'S FOLKS LEAD. TO DRAMATIC. NOW TWENTY YEARS OR SO- PROBABLY TO BE THERE FOR A FEW FOR A LITTLE BIT LONGER AND WE DEFICIT ONE OR TEN ON THE FOLKS THAT WE JUST BROUGHT ON BOARD WHICH IS ABOUT. ALMOST TWO THIRDS OF OUR WHOLE DEPARTMENT SO. ANTICIPATE IT WILL GO DOWN BUT I THINK PART OF IT IS OUR NEW EMPLOYEE ORIENTATION. TO GET FOLKS REAL COMFORTABLE QUICKLY. ON WHAT WE DO- AND I THINK JUST EXCITEMENT IT'S GENERATED NOW WITH ALL THE NEW PROGRAMS THAT WE HOUSE- BUT THE KEY IS KEEP FIRING AND THEN TRY TO KEEP THE FOLKS THAT WE HAVE AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE TRAINED. AND HAVE THE TOOLS TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT OUR GOAL TO KEEP FOLKS FROM LEAVING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- LET ME JUST SAY THAT THE- SHE WHAT YOU'VE DONE AND IN TERMS OF MAKING THE CHANGES TO HIRE THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND I THINK YOU'VE YOU'VE GIVEN US A GOOD. EXPLANATION I AGREE WITH A MY COLLEAGUE- IN REGARDS TO PHYLLIS FIGURE OUT A WAY TO KIND OF KEEP US ABREAST OF WHAT'S GOING ON- THAT THE NO FIVE- SLIDING WAS OF CONCERN BECAUSE I'D HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH STAFF ABOUT WHEN IS THE FORMER HOUSING GREG GOING TO GO OUT AND I WAS TOLD TO DATE AND THEN IT WOULD SLIP THREE MONTHS. AND WHEN I ASKED IS THERE A WAY FOR YOU LET ME KNOW BUT- HAVE TOLD PEOPLE. IT'S COMING OUT IN APRIL AND IT'S NOW JULY AND IT IT HASN'T MOVED- I WAS TOLD NO WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BE ADVISING. YOU KNOW MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE WHICH I CAN UNDERSTAND BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE A SYSTEM. WHERE IF YOU'RE IF WE'RE TOLD SOMETHING AND WE'VE COMMUNICATED IT. TOO THE- PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING AND READY TO BUILD HOUSING RIGHT- WE NEED TO. HAVE A WAY OF BEING ABLE TO BE SURE THAT- EITHER THAT WE GET A CALL TO SAY HEY YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S SLIPPING AND IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN OR WE CAN LOOK AT THAT. AT THE- AT THE END NOTICE AND KNOW THAT IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO GO OUT. THE WAY IT IS SO I APPRECIATE. AT SOME BOTTOM THAT IN AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE. COMPLICATED IT'S JUST I THINK WE NEED TO KNOW WERE OUT THERE PUSHING DEVELOPERS. AND THIS IS THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND- THE ABILITY TO STANDARDIZING GRIEVANCES VERY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE THE DEVELOPERS ARE SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY ON ATTORNEYS TO REVIEW AND WHILE I LIKE THAT BECAUSE I'M AN ATTORNEY I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT MAKES IT HARDER FOR THE UNITS TO BE AFFORDABLE AND SO THE MORE THAT WE CAN- STREAMLINE THAT PROCESS BECAUSE THEY MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR MORE THAN ONE. GRANT AND THE MORE THAT WE CAN DO STREAMLINING THE BETTER IT IS SO. VERY GOOD OKAY WELL THIS IS- AND NO ACTION REQUIRED THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY APPRECIATE- YOUR PRESENTATION. AND IT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION NOW WE JUST NEED TO GET A DIRECTOR I'M ANXIOUS TO GET IT DIRECTOR SO. FAR THANK YOU.

WE HAVE AN ANSWER THE QUESTION THREE GOOD IS THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE ARE ALEJO. SENATOR TENER DRIES OFF. YEAH I'M JUST TRYING TO GET CLEAR HERE WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS FUNDING IS. AN I SEE SORT OF A DUPLICATE HERE. AND WE'RE TRYING TO GET THIS MONEY OUT TO BUILD. FOR HOUSING RIGHT IN FOR. HOUSING DEVELOPMENT TO HAVE A QUICK REVIEW THAT I HAVE THAT WHAT I SEE FROM THIS IS. A TOTAL OF THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TEN MILLION THREE YEAR RIGHT CORRECT THAT'S GOING TO GO TOWARDS. MORE LIKE PLANNING. TO THIS FIRST TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PLAN. FOUR OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENT OF. IT SEEMS LIKE A REAL DUPLICATE HERE OF A LOT OF MONEY AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE WOULD HAVE TO DO THAT IF WE'VE ALREADY ALLOCATED TO A FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR PLANNING AND ANOTHER THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. OR PLANNING WHAT THIS SOMETHING LET ME ADDRESS THAT ARE THE EXACT ON SAID THE PROJECT OVER HOUSING POLICY THE CITY OF THIS IS A PROPOSAL FROM THE GOVERNOR JANUARY BUDGET SO- THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SEEING IT HERE. AND YOU ARE CORRECT WE'VE ACTUALLY DONE A PRETTY DECENT INFUSION OF PLANNING RESOURCES TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS STARTING WITH SENATE BILL TWO- WHICH WERE NEARLY ALMOST AWARDED AND THEN FROM LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION OUT DIRECTLY TO CITIES AND COUNTIES- AND THEN DIRECTLY TO REGION'S. ON THOSE NUMBERS ARE AVAILABLE ON THE STREET WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IS THROUGH THE TACKLE SYSTEMS PROVIDED FOR THOSE PROGRAMS. WE HAVE REALLY BEEN ABLE TO HELP COMMUNITIES AND URGE THEM OF COURSE ESPECIALLY STARTING WITH THE SENATE BILL TWO FUNDS TO ENGAGE IN PLAIN PRACTICES THAT MAKE THEM MORE PRO HOUSING. RIGHT THE TAKE AWAY BARRIERS THAT MAKE ME A LITTLE GETTING DOWN TO THE NITTY GRITTY OF PASSING ORDINANCES- THAT CAN. MAKE IT EASIER BE MORE FERTILE GROUND TO RECEIVE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. AND SO THE SENATE BILL TWO FUNDS WERE. HEAVILY TARGETED TOWARDS ACCELERATING HOUSING PRODUCTION AND SO ARTICLE SYSTEMS RESOURCES THAT WE WERE ABLE PROVIDE THEIR ALLOWED US TO BE OUT IN COMMUNITIES WITH A C. STAFF WITH A PR STAFF WITH ACTUAL CONSOLES WITH HIGHER TO GET THEM READY TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE THOSE FUNDS AND APPLY FOR THEM WE GOT VERY GOOD RESULTS IN TERMS OF. NEARLY EVERY CITY APPLYING FOR THOSE FOR. WE ARE NOW GOING TO HAVE ON THE HEELS THIS OTHER PLANT THIS OTHER PLANNING RESOURCES WHICH IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET WERE DESIGNED TO GET THEM READY FOR THE SIX THE PLANNING CYCLE. ESSENTIALLY HOW THESE OWN FOR THEIR HOUSING NEEDS AND THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT FOLLOWING THE NUMBERS THEY GET. FROM US AND THEN DOWN TO THE REGIONS IN THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION. AND SO THOSE RESOURCES ARE REALLY REALLY DID DIRECTED TOWARDS THAT PLANNING ACTIVITY. AND WE HAVE NOTICED IS WE WOULD LIKE THE CONTINUITY. OF BEING ABLE TO ASSIST THEM IN THOSE PROCESS THESE WE GET QUITE A FEW QUESTIONS- ON TOP OF THEM YOU. NOT HOT HARKING BACK TO THE PREVIOUS ITEM BUT THE NUMBER OF PIECES LEGISLATION WE PASSED THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THAT AFFECT THAT HOUSING ON THE PLANNING PROCESS ARE SIGNIFICANT. AND WHILE WE ARE ABLE ISSUE QUITE A BIT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BY WAY OF MEMORANDUMS AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS- REGULAR CAUGHT CONTINUED- INTERACTION WITH A LOOK GOVERNMENT HOW THEY ACTUALLY APPLY THOSE LAWS AND MAKE THEIR POLICIES GONNA MORE. HOUSING DO THE ACTUAL NITTY GRITTY ON THE GROUNDWORK OF HOW TO GET THERE. IS QUITE IMPORTANT- IT'S ONE THING TO PUT THE WORDS ON A PAGE IN THE CIRCUS ON THIS WAY IT'S ANOTHER TO HELP THEM THROUGH THAT. AND ONE WAY THESE COULD BE. CONTINUE THOSE THOSE PRACTICES THAT WE HAD FOR THE PROGRAMMATIC USES OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS RIGHT SO. IT COULD BE AND I WOULD PROBABLY RECOMMEND THIS IF WE SAW THESE FUNDS. LACE IS US RETAINING. CANCELED WE CAN SEND ON DEMAND. TO ANY ANY JURISDICTION THAT DEMANDS THAT INTEREST ME THE JURISDICTIONS WILL DEMAND IT. TO HELP THEM THROUGH THIS PROCESS TO MEET THEM WHERE THEY'RE AT. LARGE JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT NEED HELP IN DEVELOPING AN ORDINANCE ARE GETTING IT PASSED THEY MAY HAVE A MORE TECH LEASE BUT SMALLER JURISDICTIONS. MAY ACTUALLY NEED HELP WITH SAMPLE ORDINANCES AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS SO WE HAVE FOUND THROUGH THE- TECH ASSISTANCE WE WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE. THE SENATE BILL TO PROCESS A LOT OF REALLY. GOOD THINGS HAPPENING. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. A LOT OF SELF REPORTED INTO THE ACTIONS THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE WITH THESE PLANNING DOLLARS. ACCELERATING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF HOUSING PRETENTIOUS TO DO ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AS THEY DO. YOU KNOW EXPEDITED PERMITTING PROCESS TIMES AND WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT TO BE A ONE. ONE ONE STOP WANT A ONE TIME THING RIGHT. THE NEED IS REALLY GREAT FOR OUR OUR ENGAGEMENT WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO HELP THEM DO WHATEVER THEY CAN TO GET TO APPROVE HOUSING TO MAKE IT SO THEY ARE FERTILE GROUND TO HAVE DEVELOPERS INTERESTED IN IN BUILDING THERE AND- AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S THE IDEA BEHIND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO HAVE A CONTINUED KIND OF DROP OF TACKLE SYSTEMS OF COST AS OPPOSED TO JUST FOCUS ON A SPECIFIC PROGRAM RIGHT SO WE BROKE WE DO TEXAS FOR THE PROGRAM THEN YOU DON'T THAT PROGRAM IT KIND OF GOES WE WOULD LIKE THERE TO BE THAT ONGOING EXPERTISE BUILT THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE QUITE. OFTEN IF EVEN IF THEY RECEIVE A PLANNING GRANT THEY MAY BE SPEAKING AT THE TURN AROUND HIGHER CONSULTANT TO DO WE WORK PRODUCT LIKE THEY'RE HOUSING ELEMENT BUT THEY'RE NOT RETAINING THAT EXPERTISE ALWAYS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR OUR SMALLER COMMUNITIES WHO DON'T HAVE THE ON GOING LOOK RESOURCES TO RETAIN A LOT OF PLANNING STAFF SO IF WE'RE ABLE TO SECURE- KIND OF ON DEMAND ASSISTANCE IN A CIRCUIT RIDER PLANER ASSISTANCE IF YOU WILL TO BE ABLE TO HELP THEM WHEN THE NEEDS ARISE- I WE EXPECT WILL BE- ANY. THE LOCAL LEVEL AND HOPEFUL EXPEDITED. APPROVAL OF HOUSING WHEN IT WHEN IT COMES ACROSS THEIR CITY COUNCIL OR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. AGENDAS IT STILL SOUNDS VERY DUPLICATIVE I MEAN THE QUESTION OF. AGAIN IT WAS A VERY EXPLICIT AMOUNTS OF MONEY SET ASIDE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND IN PARTICULAR SMALLER OR THOSE WHO DIDN'T HAVE RESOURCES- PLANNING. SURE THAT'S THE FOR THEIR PLANNING ACTIVITIES THIS IS FOR THE TACKLE THIS IS HELPING UTILIZED THAT WOULD BE THE BEST WAY TO EXPLAIN IT BUT HAPPY TO. HAVE ELABORATE BY AYE AYE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT I'M- JUDY ON WHAT YOU SAID BUT I WOULD LIKE THIS IS A HOLD OPEN AND SO IN TERMS OF WHERE I'D LIKE TO SEE THIS GO IS THAT- A LOT OF THE TIMES. SO WHAT WHAT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY IS IT THE- STAFF OF THE SMALL COMMUNITIES DISAPPEARED- AND EVEN IF THEY HAD THEM THEY'RE THEY'RE GONE- IN- THE SALINAS VALLEY SALINAS ALWAYS HAD A PRETTY ROBUST PLANNING STAFF AND THEY USED TO. LOAN THEM PART TIME TO HELP. COMMUNITIES WHEN THEY HAD A DEVELOPMENT PROJECT- WHEN THEY NEEDED YOU THE HOUSING ELEMENT CELLS KINDS OF THINGS AND- SO WE WERE WE SHARED A LOT OF RESOURCES. THAT ALL DISAPPEAR DURING THE DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY AND EVERYBODY WAS DOWN TO THE NOBODY'S IN TERMS OF THAT PLANNERS. BUT BUT- BUT HAVING SAID THAT MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS JUST TO MAKE IT A GRANT AND YOU CAN GO OUT AND HIRE WHOEVER YOU WANT. BECAUSE NOT ALL PLANNERS AND CONSULTANTS ARE CREATED EQUAL AND I LIKE THE IDEA OF HAVING. BOB A CORE GROUP OR EIGHT ORGANIZATION THAT'S GOT THE HISTORY OF HELPING COMMUNITIES. AND THEN SOME PERFORMANCE. MEASUREMENTS IN IN PARTICULAR THAT- OR BEST PRACTICES AND USING NEW URBANIST PRINCIPLES- IT WHEN THEY'RE DOING THE REZONING THAT THE INCREASE DENSITY INCREASED FOR AREA RATIOS THAT THEY REDUCE PARKING- THAT THEY HAVE AN EXIT EXPEDITED PERMIT. PROCESS AND MAYBE EVEN THAT THEY- AT THE DATA SAMPLE STATE APPROVED EIGHTY YOU- PROPOSAL. IF YOU KNOW THE HARD THING ABOUT. DOING AN ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT IS IT IS THAT YOU'VE GOT% IT HAVE AN ARCHITECT THE COMES IN MAKES IT DRYING AND THEN THIS THE LOCAL STAFF HAS TO LOOK AT IT AND THEN. OTHER THAN. DOES THIS FIT IN MY YARD AND DOES IT MEET THE SET BACKS IF WE HAD A WHOLE SLEW OF EIGHTY YOU. UP STATE APPROVED PLANS THAT ARE OFF THE SHELF. THEN EFECT COMMUNITY USES THEM. THEN IT EXPEDITES. THE PLANNING PROCESS AND- MAKES IT A LOT EASIER FOR COMMUNITIES- TO BE ABLE TO PUT THE MEN BECAUSE THEY THEY'RE THEY'VE ALREADY PASSED THAT SO I'M I'M JUST LOOKING. AYE AYE. WITH THE ONE THING I DON'T THINK WE'VE DONE VERY WELL AS COME UP WITH THAT WHOLE LIST OF. OF WAYS TO EXPEDITE THAT ARE. THERE ARE. THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY ME IT USED TO BE NEW NEW URBANIST IS NOW OLD BECAUSE WE'VE WAITED A LONG TIME AGO NOW MOLD- BUT BUT THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE COULD WE COULD SAY THIS HAS TO BE PART OF YOUR PLAN HERE'S THE CONSULTANT LIST BUT HERE'S THE BUTTE YOU HAVE TO AGREE THAT THESE ARE- INCLUSIONARY HOUSING OR ORDINANCES AT DENSITY BONUSES BEYOND WHAT THE STATE- REQUIRES THOSE KINDS OF THINGS TO MAKE IT- SO THAT IF YOU'RE GONNA GET THIS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE YOU GOT AGREE THAT YOU'RE GONNA AT LEAST CONSIDER OFFER THIS MENU. YEAH IT IN YOU KNOW WHAT WE DID NOT SUCH A THE THIRTY WITH FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE STARTING THIS SB TO PLAYING GRANTS- TO SAY YOU MUST WE HAD SIX POLICY PRIORITY AREAS SOME OF WHICH YOU MENTIONED EIGHTY YOU POLICIES X. THEY REMAIN TIMES OF MORE ZONING PERMITTED BY RIGHT EXCEPT AROUND AND WE SAW THAT 92% OF THE ACTIVITIES PROPOSED BY THE CITY SO FAR SB TO HAVE HAVE HAVE STUCK IN THOSE. SO WE HAVE TRIED UP LATER THOSE IN WE DID AGAIN WITH KIND OF TALK ABOUT WHAT PER HOUSING PRINCIPLES ARE IN THE BUDGET LAST YEAR SO WE'RE TRYING TO CONTINUALLY BEAT THAT DRUM SO THE DO STEER THE RESOURCES IN THE RIGHT WAY AND SO I THINK THAT'S THE BACKGROUND BEHIND THIS PROPOSAL IS TO CONTINUE THAT COULD WORKING MAKE FOR DOESN'T. ON THE WEATHER ON THE VINE KNOWN ONE. BUT CERTAIN APPRECIATE AND YOUR COMMENTS AND HAPPY OR WITH YOU IS THE FAIR TO SAY THIS IS SO THAT. THE HOUSING ELEMENTS AND THAT THE GENERAL PLANS ARE. IN CONFORMITY WITH STATE LAW I MEAN IS THAT RIGHT IS GOING TO BE A HUGE PART OF THIS YES- THERE'S A LIVE A LOT OF. NEW REQUIREMENT THAT THESE HAVE TO DO. MUCH HARD NUMBERS AS YOU I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE OF. AND HOW YOU GET IT THAT ACTUALLY FROM HIS OWN PERSPECTIVE. GIVEN SOMEONE YOU LAWS IS GOING TO REQUIRE MANY OF THE SITES EVEN BE BY RIGHT. ALL SEASON ALL THE THINGS YOU MENTIONED SO- WE ALREADY OF COURSE ARE GETTING QUITE A FEW QUESTIONS AND WE'RE ABLE TO. HANDLES BEST WE CAN BUT CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE TO BE OUT THERE IN THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE CAN. I GUESS I'M JUST. THANK YOU MENTOR- I GUESS I'M JUST- CAN GET CONFUSED BETWEEN. YOU KNOW. THE ADDITIONAL STAFFING. RIGHT TO IMPLEMENT THE- NEW LEGISLATION. THEN THERE'S- THEN THERE'S- PLANNING. WHERE WHERE DOES THIS THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. WE INTEND FOR THAT TO GO- AND- YOU KNOW HOW DOES IT FIT INTO. THE YOU KNOW THE REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL STAFFING THAT YOU HAVE TO FILL ANYWAY SO I DID SO NO IT OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NO EXPLANATION FOR WHAT THIS THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS WITH.

IT HOUSING- RESOURCES THE GO OUT FROM FROM- FROM EIGHT CD AND FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S A WAY FOR US TO STREAMLINE THEM INTO YOUR CATEGORIES MEAN. REPHRASE THAT TO STREAMLINED THEM SO THAT YOU COULD TAKE ALL THE FORMER HOUSING AND PUT HIM IN THE ONE PROGRAM TAKE THAT THAT TRANSIT AND THE MULTI FAMILY AND PUT HIM IN TO WONDER OR- AND- IN THAT WOULD TAKE LEGISLATION OBVIOUSLY AND AS THE- SENATE CONTINUES TO WORK ON A HOUSING. PACKAGE THAT MAY BE ONE OF THE THINGS WE CAN LOOK AT. AND WHAT THE PURPOSE.

TO GET ROLL THE FUNDS OUT AND GET- PRODUCTION MOVING I GUESS IS THE BEST WAY TO PUT IT SO I PUT THAT OUT THERE THAT'S NOT ANYWHERE ON THE PLAN BUT I LIKE THE WAY THAT. THAT YOU SUGGESTED USING TAKING THESE LEGACY FUNDS AND INSTEAD OF HAVING THEM IN A FUND THAT- YOU KNOW IT'S OLD. AND WE KEEP WEEK WE CAN REPURPOSE SOME AND I'M- IT OCCURRED TO ME WE MIGHT WANT TO.
