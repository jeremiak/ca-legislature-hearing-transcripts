WE HAVE ONE BILL BEFORE US THAT IS AB SIX OH TWO WITH. MR BERMAN WE DO NOT YET HAVE A QUORUM SO WILL OPERATE AS A SUB COMMITTEE BUT PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THANK YOU FOR A LONG IT WAS AN EIGHTY SIX OR TWO TODAY. HE HAS LEGITIMATE INVENTED. SEEKS AS RELATES OF FILMMAKING. IS IN USE. I WORK FOR AN AFTERNOON GAUGING SEXUAL ACTIVITY FOR SHOWING MORE TO THE WITHOUT ACTORS CENTER FOR PURCHASES. SIMILARLY BECAUSE THIS TECHNOLOGY IS WIDELY AVAILABLE ONLINE IT IS ALSO BEEN USED NEFARIOUS LEE AGAINST NON ACTORS WHOSE PHOTOS HAVE BEEN SCRAPED FROM THE INTERNET AND SEAMLESSLY GRAFTED INTO SEXUALLY EXPLICIT MATERIAL. BEYOND THE NATURAL FEELINGS OF EMBARRASSMENT APPEARING IN A SEXUALLY EXPLICIT DEEP FAKE CAN CAUSE IRREPARABLE HARM TO A VICTIM'S REPUTATION JOB PROSPECTS PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS IN MENTAL HEALTH. SB SIX OH TWO WOULD HELP RESTORE CONTROL OVER AN INDIVIDUAL'S IMAGES OR LIKENESS BY REQUIRING CONSENT TO BE OBTAINED PRIOR TO DEPICTING A PERSON AND SEXUALLY EXPLICIT MATERIAL AND BY ALLOWING THAT CONSENT TO BE RESCINDED WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS UNLESS CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET. THIS BILL HAD RECEIVED UNANIMOUS SUPPORT IN ON THE SENATE FLOOR AND IS NO OPPOSITION AND WITH ME TODAY IS SAYING WHO'S BEEN ON BEHALF OF THE SCREEN ACTORS GUILD I RESPECT ASTRONOMICAL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION DUSTIN ON BEHALF OF SAG AFTER THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL ALONG WITH THE TEAMSTERS WHO THEIR ENTERTAINMENT MEMBERS ARE STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. THIS BILL IS PART OF A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN BY SAG AFTRA THEY'VE INTRODUCED SIMILAR BILLS AND OTHER STATES AND AT THERE DEALING WITH MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TO TRY TO. SIMILAR THINGS IN CONGRESS THE- OUR MEMBERS. THERE BODIES THEIR IMAGES THAT IS THEIR LIVELIHOOD IT. WHEN AND WHEN SOMEONE TO PICK SIT IN A WAY WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT PARTICULARLY. IN A MANNER THAT THIS BILL ADDRESSES WHICH IS SEXUALLY EXPLICIT. IT CAN REALLY DO A LOT OF DAMAGE. AND IT NOT ONLY DAMAGES THEM ECONOMICALLY DAMAGES THEIR ART BUT ALSO. YOU KNOW DOES A LOT OF EMOTIONAL DAMAGE AS WELL AND SO THE POINT OF THIS BILL IS TO REALLY REMEDY THAT. HOPEFULLY PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE NOT ONLY FOR OUR MEMBERS BUT MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THERE ARE LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF THESE VIDEOS. THAT DEPICT OUR MEMBERS AND. REGULAR EVERYDAY FOLKS WHO ARE NON CELEBRITIES WHO ARE BEING HARASSED BY. SOMEONE THEY KNOW OR OR SOMEONE THEY DON'T KNOW AND WE REALLY NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND WE DRIVER. THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA PAUSE FOR A MINUTE AND ESTABLISH. WE DON'T START THE OTHER ONE IS IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBER SERRA FLOCKS IN THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE THINK THIS IS A GREAT BILL IT'S AN IMPORTANT WORKPLACE PROTECTION SINCE ACTORS AND ACTRESSES ARE WORKERS AND UNION MEMBERS PROTECTION FOR CALIFORNIANS AND WE'RE HAPPY THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS GETTING AHEAD OF THIS TECHNOLOGY BEFORE IT'S USED TO HURT MORE PEOPLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. RIGHT SIGNALED QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. WE DON'T YET HAVE A QUORUM THE SERVER NOT THE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRPERSON FOR THE LEGISLATION. APPLE OF THINGS THAT I THINK NEED SOME CLARIFICATION. YOU ARE DEFINING DIGITIZATION AND THE BILL AND YOUR DEFINING IT AS A ONE OF THREE THINGS NUDE BODY PARTS OF ANOTHER HUMAN BEING. BEING AS THE NEW BODY PARTS OF THE DEPICTED INDIVIDUAL SO THERE WERE SOME WAS COPIED AND PASTED A PICTURE OF NUDE BODY PARTS OF SOMEONE ELSE ON TO THE NEW BODY PARTS OF SOMEONE IT'S NOT. OF COMPUTER GENERATED NUDE BODY PARTS AS A NUDE BODY PARTS OF THE DEPICTED INDIVIDUAL SO BY COMPUTER GENERATED YOU HAPPEN TO FIND THAT BUT I'M ASSUMING THAT YOU MEAN. LIKE RENDERED IN A PHOTO REALISTIC MANNER. BY A COMPUTER. YEAH AND THEN YOU'D DO SAID DEFECTED INDIVIDUAL ENGAGING IN SEXUAL CONTACT IN WHICH THE DEPICTED INDIVIDUAL DID NOT ENGAGE SO IN OTHER WORDS YOU'RE TAKING. YOU KNOW OF. PHOTOGRAPHIC REFERENCE THAT IT ACTUALLY IS THE DEPICTED INDIVIDUAL BUT YOU'RE CHANGING THE ACTION THAT THE INDIVIDUAL PERFORMING SO. ARE YOU KNOW AS SOMEONE THAT THAT. IS IN THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY I THINK YOU'VE MISSED ONE WHICH IS THAT. SOMEONE CAN. CAN PAINT YOU KNOW USING ADOBE PHOTOSHOP OR SOMETHING. GENITALIA OR SOMETHING ON TOP OF THE PHOTOGRAPH OF THE DEPICTED INDIVIDUAL AND I DON'T THINK THAT THAT WOULD CAUSE COUNT IS BEING COMPUTER GENERATED BECAUSE WAS ACTUALLY DONE BY A HUMAN. SO I JUST JUST THOUGHT I POINT THAT OUT NOW I APPRECIATE THAT AND WE'LL DEFINITELY TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE IT'S ALL TOO LATE TO MAKE ANY CHANGES EITHER BUT I WOULD NOT ADVISE IT NO IT WOULD CAN COULD DO TO CLEAN UP LEGISLATION IF NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE ALL RIGHT PROUD THAT. AND THEN ONE QUESTION THAT I DID HAVE CONCERNS OF THE SECTION OF THE BILL THAT. CREATE SOME EXEMPTIONS AND SAYS PERSONS NOT LIABLE UNDER THE SECTION UNDER THE FOLLOWING CIRCUMSTANCES IN ONE OF THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IS. BUT IF THE MATERIAL IS A WORK OF POLITICAL OR NEWS WORTHY VALUE. SO I'M JUST WONDERING THAT THE POLITICAL VALUE KIND OF RAISE MY EYEBROW SO. I MEAN IF YOUR COMPETITOR IN THE NEXT ELECTION. RATED ONE OF THESE DEFECTS I'VE GOT A DIFFERENT BILL ON THAT BUT AND POSTED IT AND SAID AND CLAIMED THAT IT WAS A POLITICAL VALUE TO THEM WITH THAT EXEMPT THEM FROM THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL. TO THE CHAIR I THOUGHT WE DON'T VIEW THAT AS SOMETHING THAT WOULD EXEMPT THEM FROM THE BILL BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF. OF THE PRODUCT THAT'S CREATED HERE WHICH IS SEXUALLY EXPLICIT MATERIAL. EIGHT HR VIEW THAT THAT WOULDN'T. ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT YORK YOUR- WHICH ARE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES I THINK THERE ARE THE AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN SAID THERE IT OTHER LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. ON WHICH WE AGREE A SIGNIFICANT BUT THAT'S NOT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL TO COVER ABOUT SECULAR TYPE OF EXPRESSION IF THAT IS THE CASE THEN. WHAT IS MEANT TO BE EXEMPTED BY. ONE THE BILL SAYS A WORK OF POLITICAL VALUE. WELL I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY FOR A FOR A COURT TO DECIDE ARE AT FOLKS THAT WE WORKED WITH UP PRIOR TO THE BILL'S INTRODUCTION WE HAD ENGAGE WITH CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLARS ON FREE SPEECH EXPERTS FOR PROBABLY A YEAR BEFORE THE SESSION EVEN BEGAN IN ANTICIPATION OF THIS LEGISLATION. AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE SUGGESTED EXEMPTIONS THAT THAT THEY SAID WE SHOULD ANSWERED IN THIS BILL FOR PROTECTION CONSTITUTIONALLY IF IT WAS EVER REVIEWED BY A COURT. SO I THINK OF THAT'S WHY THAT EXEMPTION IS IN THERE I CAN. THAT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE UP TO A COURT TO DECIDE EVENTUALLY IF SOMEONE MAKES THAT CLAIM THAT IT WAS A POLITICAL EXPRESSION THAT I. PUT SOMEBODY'S IMAGE THAT WAS ALTERED ON THE INTERNET. WE'LL HAVE TO SEE WHAT THE COURT SAID AND THAT'S WHAT THAT'S ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF TRYING TO REGULATE THIS TECHNOLOGY IS DOING IT AND A VERY NARROWLY TAILORED WAY TO AVOID FIRST AMENDMENT. THEIR CONCERNS AND VIOLATIONS BUT IT'S A GOOD POINT AND SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DIG A LITTLE DEEPER INTO ALSO SURE I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND NOT. TRYING NOT TO EXPOSE SOMEONE TO LIABILITY UNDER FIRST AMENDMENT GROUNDS BUT- IT I HATE TO SEE YOU KNOW EXEMPTION THAT BROAD PUT IN THERE BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T IMAGINE A LOT OF DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE SOMEONE COULD SAY ALL THAT THAT HAS POLITICAL VALUE FOR SURE AND I BUT THAT THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING QUESTIONS CERTAINLY HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU SIR. GIVE OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. I THINK THIS RUBBER OUT THE REYES ONE OF THE- ISSUES THAT'S REALLY AT THE HEART OF THIS AND A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT. WHILE WE LOOK AT WHAT WE CAN SEE I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD RECOGNIZE IS PRETTY OFFENSIVE BEHAVIOR. IN THIS CASE WE'RE TALKING ALSO ABOUT CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIPS AND OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED OVER TIME. BY. THINGS THAT THAT ARE OFFENSIVE BUT WHEN WE BUMP UP AGAINST FREE SPEECH RIGHTS THAT PEOPLE HAVE ESPECIALLY THE POLITICAL ROUND IT GETS TO BE VERY DIFFICULT THIS COUNTRY HAS LONG AND I THINK A PROPERLY PROTECTED POLITICAL SPEECH IS THE HIGHEST FORM OF SPEECH. THAT'S THERE AND- FOR AS LONG AS THIS COUNTRY'S BEEN ENGAGED IN POLITICS THERE ARE BAD OFFENSIVE ADVERTISEMENTS DRAWINGS POLITICAL CARTOONS. THAT CAST POLITICIANS IN VERY UNFAVORABLE LIGHTS RIGHT NOW THOSE TOOLS AS YOU CORRECTLY POINT OUT ARE. MUCH EASIER AND MUCH MORE AVAILABLE FOR ANYONE TO BE ABLE TO GRAB. GRAB SCREENSHOTS RENDER THEM DIFFERENTLY BE ABLE TO MOVE AND DRAW IN PRETTY REALISTIC REPRESENTATIONS OF THINGS BODY PARTS THAT THAT AREN'T THERE AND IN FACT ACTIONS AND ACTIVITIES. GIVEN THE POWERS OF THE COMPUTERS THAT DIDN'T REALLY HAPPEN SO WE'RE TREADING ON PRETTY NEW GROUND HERE AND I THINK WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL. IN TRYING TO CONSTRUCT PROTECT PEOPLE ABSOLUTELY BUT HOW WE CONSTRUCT THOSE PROTECTIONS THESE ARE THE ARE THE TRADITIONAL RIGHTS THAT THE CONSTITUTION WANTS TO AND NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT. IT ARE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES AND THAT'S WHY IF YOU READ THE ANALYSIS. WE TRY AND GO INTO SOME OF THIS AND SOME OF THE DELICACIES THAT ARE IN HERE AND SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES THAT. THIS LEGISLATION MAY GET TESTED IN COURT MAY NOT GET TESTED IN COURT BUT OVER TIME. AT THE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE CAREFUL HOW WE DO THIS AND THINK MORE BROADLY ABOUT HOW WE MAKE SURE WE'RE PROTECTING WHAT WE NEED TO PROTECT. OUT UNDERMINING LONGSTANDING TRADITIONAL. FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT SO YOU'RE YEAH YOU'RE YOUR QUESTIONS ARE WELL TAKEN AND WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH THAT HERE BUT THIS IS I THINK OF AN APPROPRIATE BILL AT THIS TIME AND WE'LL SEE WHERE THIS GOES BUT I KNOW WITH THIS LEGISLATURE'S CAN BE WRESTLING WITH EXACTLY THIS ISSUE IN ITS MYRIAD FORMS. OVER TIME AS WELL. SO THANK YOU SO WE DO HAVE A COURT WITH ESTABLISH A QUORUM AND THEN MISTER BERMAN YOU MAY CLOSE STONE. HERE GALLAGHER. CHAO TO GONZALEZ HOLDEN KALRA.
