I. WORLD A LONG TERM YES MANAGER- THERE WE GO. SO SB FOR WOULD ALLOW THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA-IRVINE SCHOOL OF LAW IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY SCHOOL OF LAW TO WORK WITH THE RESPECTIVE COUNTY SUPERIOR COURTS IN PARTICULAR ORANGE COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT TO- DEVELOP ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE STRATEGIES AND MECHANISMS IN PARTICULAR TO ASSIST WITH THOSE WHO CAN'T AFFORD COUNSEL- THERE ARE SEVERAL AREAS WHERE THIS WOULD BE MOST IMPORTANT LET ME JUST ADDRESS A COUPLE EXAMPLES BEFORE TURN OVER TO. DOES NOT TOMORROW. WELL ONE IS WITH RESPECT TO FOR EXAMPLE PROTECTIVE ORDERS OR RESTRAINING ORDERS CONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE- IDEALLY THE SITUATION WOULD BE. THAT WHEN SOMEONE. FILLS OUT A PETITION APPLICATION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER THAT THEY FILL IT OUT IN ITS COMPLETE. OFTENTIMES THE THERE ARE ITEMS THAT ARE MISSING SO FOR EXAMPLE- DETAILS OF THE EVENT THAT LED THAT- PERSON TO APPLY FOR SUCH AN ORDER- IT IT IF THERE ARE DETAILS THAT ARE MISSING OR EVEN SUCH A SIMPLE THING IS A DATE MISSING- IDEALLY YOU YOU GET KICKED. BACK AND SO THAT BY THE TIME THE APPLICATION GOT TO THE BENCH OFFICER BENCH OFFICE OF COURSE WOULD MAKE THE DECISION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THIS ORDER WOULD BE GRANTED- AT LEAST THE REQUISITE INFORMATION WOULD BE PRESENT- RATHER THAN FOR EXAMPLE SUBMITTING IT VENTURE. HAVE A BENCH OFFICERS I'M SORRY. THIS IS A COMPLETE YOU'LL HAVE TO COME BACK THE FOLLOWING DAY OR EVEN LATER ON THAT'S ONE AREA OTHER IS WITH RESPECT TO EXPAND- WE HAVE DECIDED THAT THAT CERTAIN- INDIVIDUAL SHOULD HAVE THE RECORDS EXPUNGED. ON FOR EXAMPLE THE LENGTH OF TIME BETWEEN CONVICTION AND- A CERTAIN OTHER PEER TO TIME AND THAT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE COULD IDENTIFY THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO SHOULD HAVE THE RECORD EXPUNGED. WELL WITH ME HERE TODAY IS THE PRESIDING JUDGE THE ORANGE COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE NOT CAMARA IS OUR WITNESS JUDGE. AFTERNOON YOUR HONOR WELCOME AND TO LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR- COMMENTS THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. UP IT'S MY PLEASURE TO OF. SUPPORT THIS BILL WHICH WOULD. ALLOW YOUR CHARACTER COURT TO PARTNER WITH VARIOUS YEARS CALIFORNIA'S ONE OR TWO ADVANCED. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE APPLIED TO LAW IN THE JUDICIAL PROCESS AS WELL AS- EDUCATE AND- A MAKE SURE THAT. OUR LAW STUDENTS IN OUR UC SYSTEM AT LEAST UC IRVINE- ARE FAMILIAR WITH A AYE AND CAN. OF ACTUALLY A APPLYING A AYE TO THE SITUATION THAT WILL ASSIST. OPERABILITY GETS AND THOSE WHO. OTHERWISE COULD NOT THE AFFORDED HURRIES IN ADDITION. A AYE. IS BEING USED. IN VARIOUS CAPACITIES AT OUR COURT AND WE ARE EXPLORING THAT THE ORDERS CHARACTER COURT IS ONE OF THE MOST ADVANCED COURTS WITH RESPECT TO TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE. CERTAIN CONNECTION WITH RESPECT TO PRIVATE. INDUSTRY GOOGLE AT THE FOR EXAMPLE AND MICROSOFT THAT THE OTHER COURTS DON'T HAVE ENTERED THE CONNECTIONS. OF WE HAVE BEEN GRANTED A CERTAIN DURANT'S TECHNOLOGY GRANTS WITH DIRECTORS JUST A COUNCIL INITIATIVES. IN EXCESS OF A MILLION DOLLARS WHICH ALLOWS US TO IT WILL BE AT- TECHNOLOGY IN WAYS THAT ARE INNOVATIVE AND CUTTING EDGE FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE. IMPLEMENTED COURT USUAL-PORTAL- AT VARIOUS JUSTICE CENTERS WHICH ALLOWS PEOPLE TO USE APPS. TO A TEACHER OR THE CASES AT VICTOR BUT JUSTICE CENTERS IN AND HOW TO LOCATE THEIR CORE ROOMS WE HAVE A- IF BLIGHTED. CERTAIN OTHER A JUROR ABSENT WHICH ALLOW PEOPLE WHO UP ARE GOING TO HAVE A JURY SERVICE AT A CERTAIN. THE JUSTICE CENTER TO KNOW WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO BE SUMMONS- TO- A CERTAIN COURTROOM IN A TO PERFORM THEIR JURY SERVICE- THESE ARE RATHER RUDIMENTARY BUT THEY'RE CERTAINLY VERY IMPORTANT. USES APPLICATION WHAT MAKES OUR COURT MORE USEFUL FOR USER FRIENDLY AND ACCESSIBLE THERE ARE OTHER WAYS THAT WE COULD IMPLEMENT. THE A I WITH RESPECT TO OUR COURT PROCESSES WITH RESPECT TO- AS THE CENTER INDICATED EXPUNGE RENTS FOR ONE IT COULD. EXPEDITE THAT PROCESS. WITH RESPECT TO FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN THE ABOLITION OF THE FELONY MURDER RULE. OF THEM BY VIEWING CERTAIN EXTENSIVE. CRIMINAL FILES THEY CONSIST. OF GREATLY AND EXPEDITING A JUDGE IN DETERMINING WHETHER A DEFENDANT IS. IS ENTITLED TO A RE SENTENCING BASEDON OF THE EVOLUTION OF THAT ROLE SO WHAT THE RESOURCES THAT THE DISTRICT COURT HOUSES WELL AS THE RESOURCES OF THE YEARS CALIFORNIA WITH RESPECT TO PROFESSORS. WHO WERE VERY NOTED IN THE AYE FIELD- WILL CREATE A SHIRT SYNERGISTIC SITUATION WHICH WILL BENEFIT WHILE THE COURT BUT THE- UNIVERSITY AND ITS STUDENTS AS WELL. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES HERE IN SUPPORT. WE DO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMEONE IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK PER SE- BUT VERY BRIEFLY AND THEN WILL JUST SIMPLY TAKE- NAME AND AFFILIATION. EVEN BOMBS YOU JUST ALSO OF CALIFORNIA WITH GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS HEATHER PREDATOR CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS OF THE DíAS NOT TO VERY GOOD. THANK YOU- ARE THERE ANY OTHER. WITNESSES HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS ITEM. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. REACHING NUMBER TO BRING IT BACK TO THE DICE I HAVE A COUPLE THOUGHTS I WANT TO SHARE WITH ALL OF YOU IN THIS- YOU KNOW THEY'RE A AYE IN ALL THESE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES OFFER VERY VERY EXCITING OPPORTUNITIES- BUT- IF YOU RECALL FROM JUST ABOUT ANY SCIENCE FICTION FILM THAT YOU HAVE SEEN THE MIND IN THE CAPACITY TO TAKE WHAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE IS FOR GOOD. AND TRANSPOSASE INTO NOT SO GOOD OR EVEN EVIL ALSO EXIST SO WE ARE NOW INTO SORT OF A BRAVE NEW WORLD TALKING ABOUT IT HERE IN A WAY THAT I ABSOLUTELY AGREE TO HELP IMPROVE- PRO PER LITIGANTS ARE PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME FOLKS WHO HAVE NO ACCESS TO LEGAL COUNSEL OUR LEGAL AID AS SOCIETIES IN THIS AND ASSOCIATIONS ARE MAXED OUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED SO. THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY AND I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS AND FOR THE COURT TO ALSO DEMONSTRATED TO INTEREST IN TRYING THIS NEW APPROACH- THE AND AS WE HAD DISCUSSED OUR- A I HAS TO BE. APPROACH VERY METHODICALLY A AND THOUGHTFULLY SO I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR AGREEING. TO USE THE PARAMETERS AND THE GUIDANCE- IN THE GUIDELINES OF THE ASILOMAR PRINCIPLES- AGAIN. BECAUSE WE ARE- THEN INTO A BRAVE NEW. WORLD IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE SET THESE KINDS OF PARAMETERS AS OUR MINIMUM EXPECTATIONS AND AGAIN IT'S MY HOPE THAT AS WE- ARE A FURTHER LOOK AT A AYE WE ADOPT THOSE ASILOMAR PRINCIPLES TO THAT- RESEARCH IN THAT EFFORT AS WELL. BUT THERE'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT A I AND ALL THESE ALGORITHMS AND THAT'S THE NOTION OF IMPLICIT BIAS. WHO'D A THUNK BUT THERE IT IS AND WE KNOW THAT IT DOES EXIST THEY CAN BE BAKED INTO THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND SYSTEMS AND- THAT'S WHY I THINK CONTINUING TRANSPARENCY OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY AS WE- START MOVING INTO THAT A OUR WORLD ARE GOING TO BE CRITICAL TO LOOK AT THESE THINGS. TO MAKE SURE WE ADDRESS IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS IMPLICIT BIAS- AGAIN IT'S IMPORTANT TO. TO HAVE FIND THESE CREATIVE SOLUTIONS BUT WE DON'T WANT TO STREAMLINE ACCESS TO THE COURTS FOR INDIGENT CALIFORNIANS AT THE EXPENSE OF POTENTIALLY INADVERTENTLY FURTHER MARGINALIZING THEM. AND SO- I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE IN THAT PROCESS I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE DIALOGUING WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IN THE COURTS. TO ENSURE THAT ANY LEGISLATION- TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THESE OTHER CHALLENGES A COUPLE OF WHICH I'VE MENTIONED THERE'S ALSO THE CHALLENGE. OF FOR EXAMPLE ANY PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE CREATED BY THIS HOW WE GONNA DO WITH THOSE- AND THE SURROUNDING THE UNAUTHORIZED PRACTICE OF LAW. WHICH WE HAVE SEEN IN THE FORM OF AN ATARI OWES HERE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND DO THEM SEVERE CREDITS OKAY WELL THIS IS VERY EXCITING. THERE ARE. OBSTACLES IN ACTION AND IT IS MY HOPE AND I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE. THIS OFFERING AND THE COURTS. WILL TAKE ALL IN. THIS WEEK- FORWARD SO I JUST WANTED TO BE SURE THAT I FEEL THAT WAY BUT ALL IN A AYE STUFF THAT WE'RE DOING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE HAS GREAT POSSIBILITIES. AND GREAT POTENTIAL DOWNSIDE SO THOSE ARE MY THOUGHTS AND IF ANYONE ELSE HAS A COMMENT SENATOR BORCHERS. THANK YOU TO. I WILL WORK AND- SENATOR UMBERG FOR OF REMOVING THIS FOR- I THINK THIS WOULD BE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE FURTHER IN THROUGH THE A AYE- SUBCOMMITTEE. BUT I THINK WHEN YOU COMPARE WHAT WE ARE DOING IS AMERICANS TO WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES ARE DOING AROUND THE WORLD. WE ARE. WE ARE NOT PROGRESSING FAST ENOUGH AND I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP. WITH A I AM THIRTIES TO BEING. IT'S ALL THE- DATA ENTRY IT'S A BASELINE ACCUMULATION OF INFORMATION THAT ALLOWS FOR PERSPECTIVE USE. AND WE HAVE TO START SOMEWHERE AND I THINK THAT IS PROBABLY WHERE. YOUR PILOT PROGRAMS GOING- I DO KIND ONE ECHO- ONE CONCERN- THAT THE CHAIR WOMAN WHO IDENTIFIED IS THAT. I HOPE THIS DOES NOT GO IN THE DIRECTION OF. PREDICTIVE OUR DECISION MAKING BY THE JUDGE AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE WHETHER WE START LOOKING AT. AT THE PAST SENTENCING PATTERNS YOU'RE LOOKING A PROPENSITY FOR RECIDIVISM ALL ALL THAT WOULD BEAR INTO A JUDGE'S DECISION MAKING PROCESS- I'M I SINCERELY HOPE THAT WE DON'T ALLOW IT TO- MOVING THAT INTO THAT RANGE YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT FROM THE OTHER SIDE FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE. SIDE SO WE START TALKING ABOUT AUTUMN REESER TALKING ABOUT NOTIFICATIONS THAT CAN BE GIVEN FOR WITNESSES OR FOR PEOPLE TO ATTEND COURT- THAT'S OF THOSE ARE SIMPLE PATTERNS THAT CAN BE THAT THAT CAN BE PUT IN I THINK IF WE DO IT AND WE'RE LOOKING UPON IT IN THAT FASHION. I THINK THIS IS A FANTASTIC. I AM I AM UNHAPPY THAT YOU DID NOT FRESNO IN YOUR PILOT. AREA BUT MAYBE NEXT TIME. THE DISCUSSION OF BUT I THINK IF WE CAN SEE IT WORKING WELL I THINK WE'VE GOT TO IT'S SO ORANGE COUNTY AND IS IT ALSO. ALAMEDA COUNTY THROUGH A- BUT IF THIS DOES WORK AND I EXPECT THAT WE'LL START SEEING IT MOVE BEYOND THAT. MY UNDERSTANDING IS BECAUSE THE COURTS HAVE INDICATED A STRONG INTEREST AND THAT THESE LAW SCHOOLS HAVE ALSO INTERESTS. INDICATED A STRONG INTEREST- BUT AGAIN I THINK WE NEED TO START SOMEWHERE BUT WE NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS WE ARE NOT CHINA- WE DON'T WANT THIS INFORMATION. OF BEING USED IN WAYS THAT MIGHT TONIGHT DEMOCRACY AND THE ABILITY PEOPLE TO EXERCISE THEIR FREEDOMS. WHICH ARE SO IMPORTANT TO US IN THIS COUNTRY SO I THINK THIS IS A GOOD. A GOOD STEP IN PERHAPS IT WILL EXPAND GOING FORWARD. STERN YOU HAD TO OF THOUGHT YOUR QUESTION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- SORRY MISS THE OPENING HEARING TO AND THANKS TO THE STAFF OVER THE BREAK FOR WORKING HARD WE KNOW IT'S GONNA BE GREAT YEARS OF. THANKS FOR THAT. SHARE SOME OF THE TREPIDATION APPRECIATE THOUGH THE NARROW SCOPE OF THE PILE AND FRANKLY THERE'S VERY FEW INSTITUTIONS I DRESSED. AS MUCH AS THE ONES YOU'VE NAMED IN THE PILOT. COMMAND THE- THE COURT- FOR STEPPING AND ALSO THE DEANS. I'M A LITTLE BIASED. BEING FROM BERKELEY BUT I APPLAUD SHIMMERING SKI FOR STEPPING IN AND- AND AS FAR AS HAVING SOME OF THOSE SORT OF. CONSTITUTIONAL. GUARD RAILS AND THAT SORT OF BUILT INTO THE DNA OF THIS PROJECT I THINK YOU'VE GOT. THE DETENTIONS ALSO ENGAGED TO HAVE THAT SORT OF PUBLIC INTEREST IN MIND AND ARE NOT JUST LOOKING FOR. YOU KNOW OPTIMIZATIONS OR STREAMLINING FOR THE SAKE OF STREAMLINING BUT REALLY TO PURSUE JUSTICE AND SO IT IF THERE'S AN APPROPRIATE TIME I LOVE TO BE ADDED ON AS A CO AUTHOR THE MEASURE- AND I WAS HOPING IT DOES HAVE TO BE NOW COULD. IN YOUR CLOTHES BUT JUST TO. OUR STATE A LITTLE EARLY IN THE- THAT IN SCHOOL COULD LOOK LIKE JUST. JUST USE A BADGE AND ASIAN RECOGNIZING THAT THINGS ARE GONNA HAVE TO CATCH UP WHAT DOES THAT EXPERIENCE LOOK LIKE. FOR THE- FOUR HUNDRED IF WE HAVE THIS DISTRICTS ARE ASTONISHING WITH THAT. JUSTICE ISSUES BUT FOR HE 80% OF THE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS. WHO ARE MAKING LESS THAN THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH USING SELF HELP PROGRAMS WITH EXPERIENCE START TO LOOK LIKE POTENTIALLY IN THESE ALAMEDA ERROR OF C. FIVE. THANK YOU MANAGER. PART I THINK THERE WAS A DISCUSSION ABOUT USING THIS PROGRAM FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITUATIONS FOR EXPUNGEMENT AND I THINK AS IT EVOLVES WE'LL FIND OUT POTENTIALLY MORE THINGS THAT CAN BE. USED FOR SO I THINK THAT'S WHY. DOING THIS GRADUALLY AND VERY TRANSPARENTLY I THINK IS GOING TO BE KEY JUST TO BE CLEAR THE BILL DOESN'T SPECIFY THOSE INITIAL FOCUS SERIES IT LEAVE SOME NOTES AGGRESSION BUT THOSE COULD BE ANTICIPATED OKAY EXACTLY HOW TO THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE ALL RIGHT TO OF WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. UP THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF SOME USEFUL COMMENTS AND AN INSIGHT LET ME RESPOND A FEW- FIRST WITH RESPECT TO IMPLICIT BIAS. THAT THAT IS A CONCERN ITS CONCERN OF ALL OF OURS OF IMPLICIT BIAS EXISTS RIGHT NOW IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. OF THE DAY BETWEEN IMPORTANT BY THAT EXISTS RIGHT NOW. I ASSUME USE ARTIFICIAL SINCE IS THAT THAT ONE IS MORE A SPIRIT AND GO BACK IT WILL BE YOUR GOLD MAKE SURE YOU CAME BACK. THE SYSTEM LET THEM PUT EGGS STUDENT WHAT OUTPUT WERE CREATED OF IMPLICIT BIAS EXISTS SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN SOMEONE- HANDS IN THEIR PETITION FOR A PROTECTIVE ORDER. IN A CLERK NOTICES THAT THERE'S NOT A DATE ON IT I CLERK AND THEN FOR TO THE BENCH ALSO BRANCH OFFICES INCOMPLETE COME BACK TOMORROW OR THE CLERK CAN SAY. YOU KNOW YOU FORGOT TO DATE THE END DEPEND UPON WHO THE CLERK TELLS THEY FOR. THE MAY REFLECTIVE BOB THIS MAY REFLECT THE WORK ETHIC OF THE CLERK MAY REFLECT THEIR GENEROSITY OF SPIRIT BUT BUT ALREADY EXIST IMPLICIT BIAS AND SO PART OF THIS IS ACTUALLY. NAY IT'S THAT IMPLICIT BIAS. SECOND IS ON TRACK ALL OF THE. THE END WITH RESPECT TO THE A MACHINE MAKING JUDICIAL DETERMINATIONS THOSE ARE ANTITHETICAL TO ONE THE PROCESS AND TO THE VISION OF THIS PROCESS- WE- ANTICIPATE THAT THE BILL BE OTHER APPLICATION SO I CAN THINK OF SEVERAL RIGHT HERE FROM CIVIL AREA IS THOSE OF YOU WHO PRACTICE IN CIVIL LITIGATION A DEMURRER WHEN YOU FILE A DIMMER- IF THERE'S AN ANALYSIS IN THE COMPUTER SAYS ARE THE HELP WITH SAYS LOOK AT YOU KNOW YOU FORGOTTEN ELEMENT. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE DEMURRER IT IS GRANTED IT SIMPLY MEANS THAT THAT THE BENCH OFFICER THEN IS BLURTED THAT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A AN ELEMENT THAT'S BEEN OMITTED AND THUS FOCUS THE ATTENTION OF THE CLERK OF THE COURT SO. ANYWAY I'M SURE I'LL BE BACK WITH OTHER APPLICATIONS AS THIS INVOLVES ONE OF THANK JUDGE DOC OR THE FINEST PRESIDING IN THE HISTORY ORANGE COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT WOULD SAY THAT EVEN IF I WON A PRESS ATTORNEY IN ORDER. COUNTY SO. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION VERSION I VOTE. RIGHT THERE'S A MOTION OF BY SENATOR STERN AND THE MOTION IS. DO PASS. TO SENATOR PROPS OF TO PASS AS AMENDED TO SENATE APPROPRIATIONS ALRIGHT A MAN SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL JACKSON HI JACKSON I BORDERS WERE JUST I WOULD ALSO GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ I'D JONES.

WADE DECISION MADE ACCESS TO ABORTION BOWL SAFE AND LEGAL AND IS GREATLY IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF WOMEN AND FAMILIES THIS LANDMARK DECISION REMAINS A CORNERSTONE OF WHAT EFFORTS TOWARDS EQUALITY. THIS DECISION PROVIDED CRITICAL REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM THAT HAS ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN SOCIETY INCLUDING POLITICALLY SOCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY CALIFORNIA HAS LED THE COUNTRY AND SUPPORTING REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND MUST CONTINUE IN THIS CRITICAL ROLE. THE CAL IS THE CORPORATE NUYS A ONE EIGHT THE WOMAN TURNED TO SEE PROTECT HER CONCERT IN ALL RIGHT TO SEE FOR YEARS. ROE V. WADE WAS DEAD. TURNING PRO V. BUT ONCE AGAIN THE BOARD AND- HEALTH CRISIS 7% OF AMERICANS OPPOSE EFFORTS TO DO SO SAID ANOTHER WAY 70% OF AMERICANS SUPPORT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE SIMPLY PUT OVERTURNING ROE V. WADE BUT NOT INTO PORTION WOULD SIMPLY MEAN THAT WOMEN WOULD HAVE UNSAFE ABORTIONS AND DIE. HERE WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT IS MOLLY ROBESON FROM PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND SHEENA HOVIS NERVE. NARAL NATE NAY BRAWL SORRY AS FOR THE RUN ALRIGHT LADIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWO MINUTES PLEASE YEAH. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS SHANNON HOW THIS TIME THE DIRECTOR FOR NARAL PRO CHOICE CALIFORNIA. NAY ROW IS THE OLDEST AND LARGEST ABORTION RIGHTS ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION IN THE COUNTRY WITH TWO POINT FIVE MILLION MEMBERS NATIONALLY AND TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE THOUSAND MEMBERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. FORTY SEVEN YEARS AGO READ THE WAY TO GIVE WOMEN THE ABILITY TO CONTROL THEIR OWN REPRODUCTIVE DESTINIES. A RIGHT THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO WOMEN BEING EQUAL. IN SOCIETY. THE ANNIVERSARY OF ROE SHOULD BE A CELEBRATION FOR THE PROGRESS OF OUR COUNTRY. AND YET THE FORTY SEVENTH ANNIVERSARY A SOMBER. THIS LANDMARK SUPREME COURT DECISION IS ON THE LINE LIKE NEVER BEFORE. IN MARCH THE COURT WILL HEAR ARGUMENTS IN JUNE MEDICAL SERVICES VERSE KEY. THE FIRST MAJOR CHALLENGE TO ABORTION ACCESS AND SPREAD KAVANAUGH'S CONFIRMATION. THE CASE WHICH CONCERNS A LAW IDENTICAL TO A TEXAS LAW THAT THE SUPREME COURT STRUCK DOWN JUST FOUR YEARS AGO. IT'S FURTHER PROOF THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS PAID BACK HIS DEBTS TO THE ANTI CHOICE EXTREMISTS. WHO PUT HIM IN OFFICE. SINCE KAVANAUGH'S CONFIRMATION AN EMBOLDENED ANTI CHOICE MOVEMENT HAS UNLEASHED AN UNPRECEDENTED WAVE OF ABORTION BANS WITH THE SPECIFIC INTENT. OF GETTING A CASE TO THE SUPREME COURT AND ROE. EARLIER THIS MONTH TWO HUNDRED AND SEVEN ANTI CHOICE LAWMAKERS IN CONGRESS SIGNED ONTO AN AMICUS BRIEF URGING THE COURT TO RECONSIDER ROE. IT IS NO SURPRISE THE JUST FIFTEEN OF THESE CONGRESS MEMBERS ARE WOMEN. WE MAY NOT KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS FOR ROW. BUT WE DO KNOW THAT SUPPORT FOR THE RIGHT TO ACCESSIBLE XIN IS MORE POPULAR THAN EVER. LIKE SUPPORT FOR ROE V. WADE IS AT AN ALL TIME HIGH. 77% OF AMERICANS SUPPORT THE SUPREME COURT DECISION THAT'S NOT JUST MAJORITY AT THE CONSENSUS. IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY. ROW IS A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY UNDERSCORING THE BASIC PRINCIPLE THAT WOMEN CANNOT BE EQUAL PARTNERS IN SOCIETY WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO MAKE PERSONAL DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR OWN BODIES AND FUTURES. ON BEHALF OF NARAL I THANK CENTER LEYVA LEYVA FOR BRING FOR THIS RESOLUTION I'M GRATEFUL TO CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE FOR FIGHTING TO PROTECT AND EXPAND REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM. AND I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT RESOLUTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON KEREN MEMBERS AYE MOLLY ROPES AND LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES OF CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT THE SEVEN AFFILIATES WHO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE FOR OVER SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND PATIENTS. THEIR HUNDRED NAY HEALTH CENTERS IN THE STATE. I WANT TO THANK SENATOR LEYVA FOR HER LEADERSHIP OFFERING THIS RESOLUTION TO CELEBRATE THE FORTY SEVENT ANNIVERSARY OF THE HISTORIC. ROE V. WADE SUPREME COURT DECISION. WHILE WE CELEBRATE THIS ANNIVERSARY WE ALSO MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE RIGHT TO SAFE LEGAL ABORTION IS UNDER ATTACK AS SHANNON IS MENTIONED. LAST YEAR OVER THREE HUNDRED ABORTION RESTRICTIONS BY EXTREMIST POLITICIANS WERE INTRODUCED. ALL AIMED A LIMITING ACCESS AND STRIPPING AWAY FREEDOM FROM PREGNANT PEOPLE AND ASHANTI MENTION THIS YEAR THE SUPREME COURT WILL HEAR A DECISION THAT COULD UNDO THE PROTECTIONS GRANTED BY ROE V. WADE. WE ARE FORTUNATE IN CALIFORNIA TO HAVE LEADERS WHO STAND WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND UNDERSTAND THAT ABORTION CARE IS HEALTH CARE AND HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT. WE ALSO THINK THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE FOR CONTINUING TO TAKE STEPS TO EXPAND NOT BANNED AND INVEST IN SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. INCLUDING SAFE LEGAL ABORTION. WE ALSO THANK YOU ALL FOR BRINGING AWARENESS THROUGH THIS RESOLUTION AND FOR THESE REASONS ARE PROUD TO SUPPORT AS OUR SIXTY SIX. ENERGIZED VOTE. THANK YOU THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON IF TWO MINUTES EACH. SURE MEMBERS MY NAME IS GREG BIRCH WITH THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY COUNCIL I'M SURE YOU REALIZE WITH THE RECENT CHANGES ON THE SUPREME COURT THAT ROE VERSUS WADE DECISION IS ON LIFE SUPPORT. BUT I ALSO BELIEVE PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR ABORTION IS IN A PRECARIOUS SITUATION BECAUSE THE MORAL REASONING USED TO JUSTIFY ABORTION IS BEING EXPOSED ABORTION IS ONLY SURVIVED THIS LONG BECAUSE PROPONENTS WERE ABLE TO DECEIVE PEOPLE ABOUT THE BRUTAL REALITY OF THE PRACTICE. JUST LISTEN TO THE WAY THE BOARD IT'S ADVOCATES TALK ABOUT THE PROCEDURE. DO YOU HEAR THE LANGUAGE GYMNASTICS USED TO DISTRACT PEOPLE AWAY FROM THINKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS DURING AN ABORTION. WHY DO THEY DO THAT. WHY CAN'T THEY TALK ABOUT ABORTION IN PLAIN AN EXACTING LANGUAGE I THINK YOU KNOW THE ANSWER. IT DISTRACTING PEOPLE FROM THE REALITY OF WAR XIN HAS BECOME NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE WITH ADVANCES IN ULTRASOUND TECHNOLOGY. I HAVE THREE KIDS OF MY OWN AND I REMEMBER BEING IN FIRST INTRODUCED TO MY CHILDREN THROUGH THE ULTRASOUND MACHINE. I SAW MY DAUGHTER'S HEART BEATING IN MY SON'S ARMS AND LEGS IN MOTION JUST A FEW MONTHS AFTER CONCEPTION. IT WAS AN UNBELIEVABLE EXPERIENCE FOR A NEW FATHER. SO WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHAT ABORTION IS I RECALL THOSE FLICKERING ULTRASOUND PICTURES AND I THINK OF UNBORN CHILDREN JUST LIKE MY OWN GETTING THEIR LITTLE LIMBS TORN OFF BY AN ABORTIONIST. THE HORROR OF IT CAN HARDLY BE EXPRESSED AND I THINK HOW CAN AN INTELLIGENT IN OTHERWISE VERY NICE AND GOOD HEARTED PEOPLE JUST. MY TRUTH REVEALING EXPERIENCE WITH AN ULTRASOUND MACHINE IS REPEATED THOUSANDS OF TIMES A DAY. AND THIS TRUTH TELLING TECHNOLOGY IS CHANGING HEARTS AND MINDS AND CONVINCING MANY MANY HARDENED. PRO ABORTION ADVOCATES THAT NOTHING JUSTIFIES THIS BARBARIC PRACTICE. I'M HERE TODAY TO REMIND YOU OF THE CRUEL REALITY YOU ARE CELEBRATING IN HOPES THAT ONE DAY GOD WILL OPEN YOUR EYES IN TURN YOU INTO PRO LIFE ADVOCATES AS HE IS DONE WITH MILLIONS OF OTHERS THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU PROTEST NEXT WITNESS PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS MY NAME IS ONE THAT SELLS AND I SERVICE THE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIANS FOR LIFE RECENTLY GOVERNOR NEWSOM ANNOUNCED THAT CALIFORNIA WILL BECOME A NO KILL STATE. WHEN IT COMES TO SO CALLED UNWANTED DOGS AND CATS YET HERE TODAY YOU'RE VOTING ON A RESOLUTION TO CELEBRATE THE INTENTIONAL KILLING OF SIXTY MILLION HUMAN BEINGS. AND HURTING THEIR MOTHERS FOR A LIFETIME BUT THE IRONY OF THAT JUXTAPOSITION SINK IN FOR A MOMENT. ALSO THE WOMAN AT THE CENTER OF THE ROAD BE WEIGHED FISSION CHAIN ROW IS ACTUALLY A REAL PERSON BY THE NAME OF NORMA MCCORVEY. SHE WROTE A BOOK ONE BY LOVE THAT DESCRIBES HOW SHE WAS MISTREATED IN USED BY THE ABORTION ACTIVISTS. LATER SHE HAD A CONVERSION A BECAME A PRO LIFE LEADER. YOU SEEN OUR- NORMAL COOPER CORBIS OWN WORDS THIS IS WHAT SHE SAID AND I QUOTE. YOU ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT AFTER YOU HAD AN ABORTION ABORTION KINDA SUCKS YOUR SOUL DRY. IT MAKE SURE VERY ANGRY PERSON INSIDE FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN IN QUOTE AND SHE SAW A LOT OF ABORTIONS THAT'S NOT AN ABORTION CLINIC MANAGER SIMILE DOCTOR BERNARD NATHANSON THE FOUNDER OF NAY RAW AND A FORMER ABORTIONIST REFERRED TO ABORTION AS QUOTE. THE MOST ATROCIOUS HOLOCAUST IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. KILLING THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US THE WEEK THE VOICELESS THE QUOTE IN PERFECT. AND THE QUOTE AND WANTED IS A LEAD FOR HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS THAT AFFECTS ALL OF THIS. BABY GIRLS ARE BEING KILLED JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE FEMALE IS THAT SOMETHING WE CELEBRATE. 90% OF BABIES IDENTIFIED AS HAVING DOWN SYNDROME WERE KILLED HERE IN OUR COUNTRY WELL IN SOME OTHER COUNTRIES. DOWN SYNDROME HAS BECOME EXTINCT AS- HUMAN BEINGS WITHOUT DIAGNOSIS ARE LEGALLY KILLED THROUGH ABORTION. BABIES AND BABIES OF COLOR BEING KILLED BY ABORTION AT DISPROPORTIONATE RATES. WE DO NOT SOLVE POVERTY BY KILLING POOR CHILDREN. WE HAVE A DREAM WHEN WOMEN CAN SUCCEED WITHOUT HAVING TO KILL OUR CHILDREN WE HAVE A DREAM WHERE WE CAN ALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE WOMEN HAVE THE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT WE NEED WHEN FACING THE CHALLENGES OF AN UNEXPECTED PREGNANCY THE AQ SO THAT SOME DAY AS ABORTION BECOMES UNTHINKABLE THANK YOU THANK YOU. THE YOU WAY OVER THE TWO MINUTES THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS. I NOTED THIS. RECOGNITION OF A FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOM FOR WOMEN CORD FORTY SEVEN YEARS AGO. AND I LOOK AROUND THIS ROOM AND REALIZED THAT MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM WERE NOT A LIFE. BEFORE ROE. AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT LIFE WAS LIKE BEFORE ROE V. WADE. I WAS TWENTY THREE SO NOW YOU'LL KNOW HOW WILL DIE I'M ABOUT TO BE. A WIN ROLE. WAS ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE US SUPREME COURT. AND I HAD A NUMBER OF FRIENDS WHO I HAD TO THE UNEXPECTED UNWANTED PREGNANCIES WHO WANTED TO TERMINATE THOSE PREGNANCIES THEY WERE IN SCHOOL THEY WANTED TO CONTINUE GETTING THEIR EDUCATION THERE WERE NO RESOURCES FOR WOMEN WHO BECAME PREGNANT. AT THAT POINT IN TIME MANY YOUNGER WOMEN HAD TO LEAVE SCHOOL AND ENDED UP IN LIVES TO POVERTY WERE LIVES TO SHANE. AND SO ROE V. WADE GAVE WOMEN AN OPPORTUNITY NOT TRUST TO MAKE THEIR OWN. PERSONAL CHOICES ABOUT MOTHERHOOD AND PARENTHOOD BUT ALSO THE CHOICE OF LIFE BECAUSE SO MANY WOMEN WHO WERE DESPERATE TO END AN UNWANTED PREGNANCY WOULD END UP WITH SEPSIS AND DIE. THERE WERE WINGS OF HOSPITALS EXCLUSIVELY FOR WOMEN WHO HAD TRIED TO SELF INDUCE AN ABORTION OR HAD A BOTCHED ABORTION DOWN IN MEXICO OR BY SOMEONE WHO WAS NOT QUALIFIED TO PERFORM THIS PROCEDURE WE WERE LOSING MOTHERS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN. MOTHERS WHO HAD SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE CHILDREN WHO COULD NOT AFFORD TO FEED THEIR CHILDREN LEAVE THEM AS WAR FRIENDS BECAUSE THEY WERE SO DESPERATE TO END UP PREGNANT. SO I JUST WANT TO REMIND THOSE OF YOU IN THIS ROOM WHO WERE NOT HERE THEN. THIS WAS A REAL PROBLEM ABORTION WILL NOT END. WOMEN WANT AND I BELIEVE DIFFERENTLY THAN YOU BUT WITH RESPECT THAT THIS IS A WOMAN'S CHOICE. AND IT IS ONE THAT SHE IS ENTITLED TO MAKE WITH HER DOCTOR WITH HER FAMILY WITH HER GOD WITH WHOM EVER SHE CHOOSES IT IS NOT MY RIGHT IT IS NOT YOUR RIGHT IT IS THE RIGHT OF EVERY WOMAN. AND SO WE ARE HERE NOW FORTY SEVEN YEARS LATER WITH ROLE AT GREAT RISK BECAUSE IT HAS BECOME A POLITICAL FOOTBALL IT HAS BECOME A DIVERSION IN THE POLITICAL WORLD WHICH IS OF GREAT SADNESS TO ME THAT WOMEN ARE YET AGAIN THE PINATA OF POLITICS. AND I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND SO I AM VERY PROUD I HAVE CARRIED THIS BILL PREVIOUSLY I AM PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR I THINK WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WHO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. AND WE USED TO HAVE A SAYING THAT LIFE BEGINS AT CONCEPTION AND ENDS AT BIRTH BECAUSE THE VERY SAME PEOPLE OR I SHOULD SAY MANY OF THOSE SAME PEOPLE WHO SAY- BUT THIS IS LIFE. ONCE THAT LIFE OCCURS THEY ARE UNWILLING TO HELP THOSE WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO FEED OR CLOTHE OR HOUSE THOSE CHILDREN THEY IGNORE THEM. THEY SAY THAT IS YOUR PROBLEM THAT IS YOUR DESTINY THAT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AND SO UNLESS AND UNTIL WE HAVE A CONSISTENT POSITION ONE THAT ALSO TALKS ABOUT THE ABILITY TO MAKE. A CONTRACEPTION AVAILABLE BECAUSE SEXUAL BEHAVIOR IS ONE OF GOD'S WAYS TO PROCREATE THE SPECIES AT WHETHER IT'S DONE. IN MARRIAGE WHETHER IT'S DONE THROUGH A VIOLENT ACT. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT MEN HAVE THE LADY COME A DECISION ABOUT WHEN WEATHER IN WITH. THEY CHOOSE TO HAVE THAT MOST PRECIOUS FAMILY WITH THAT. I WOULD THE OPEN THE FLOOR WE'LL START WITH SENATOR MINING AND THEN OUR OR CENTER CONSOLE AS YOU WERE FIRST PLEASE. EVERYTHING I WANTED TO SAY BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD ESPECIALLY IN THIS DAY AND AGE WHERE- WOMEN'S RIGHTS ARE BEING ATTACKED AND TO SEE AN AMICUS BRIEF WITH OUT AMICUS BRIEF. WITH A MAJORITY OF MEN MAIL LEGISLATORS MAKING DECISIONS FOR WOMEN I FEEL AS IS BEYOND UNFAIR SO I THINK IT IS- INCH. AND I'M SO GLAD THAT WE HAVE TO- YOU HAVE THIS AND I'M GLAD WE'RE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION BUT IT SADDENED. OF SADDENS ME AS WELL THAT THIS DAY AND AGE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TO PROVIDE ANOTHER RESOLUTIONS AND WHERE WE STAND BUT- FOR THAT I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. SENATOR MONEY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IF I MIGHT JUST A QUESTION FOR THE PLANNED PARENTHOOD REPRESENTATIVE- I THINK ALL OF YOU MADE REFERENCE TO INCREASED LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS TO RESTRICT ACCESS- NOT JUST TO ABORTIONS BUT IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN ACCESS TO FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES IS THAT CORRECT ACROSS THE COUNTRY I. AND DOESN'T THE DATA SHOW THAT ACCESS TO FAMILY PLANNING CAN ACTUALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ABORTIONS- BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF UNWANTED PREGNANCIES. AND YOU KNOW CAN YOU GIVE US AN ESTIMATE OF THE PERCENTAGE OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD SERVICES. THAT ARE SUPPORTING WOMEN'S HEALTH AND- FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES UNDER PERCENT OF OUR SERVICES WOULD HELP WOMEN'S HEALTH ALL PEOPLE'S HEALTH AND REPRODUCTIVE SERVICES BUT SOME OF THE LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS. HAVE BOTH SIDES AND HAVE SUCCEEDED IN DENYING GOVERNMENT FUNDING TO ANY OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY PLANNED PARENTHOOD. AND WOULD IT BE SAFE TO CONCLUDE BECAUSE OF THAT LOSS OF SUPPORT- WOMEN WILL HAVE FEWER OPTIONS AND- LIKELY PURSUE. ON HEALTH FOR SOLUTIONS IN OTHER STATES ABSOLUTELY YEAH THANK YOU I'M AN OF THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED I'D BE HONORED TO MOVE IT AND I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A PLACE FOR CO AUTHORS IT WOULD BE HONORED TO HAVE A HEAVY SENATOR MONNING THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION ANY FURTHER. DISCUSSION SENATOR STERN. APPRECIATE THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT MADAM CHAIR AND FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I'M AFTER WOMEN'S CAUCUS ONLY BE NOW LIE HERE AND SIGN ON TO IF I MAY UM. AND JUST. STATED. AS MUCH AS WOMEN ARE BEING CHALLENGED AND DEMONIZED RIGHT NOW THAT- I'VE A FEELING THE PUSH BACKS GONNA BE IMMENSE AND NATIONWIDE IN EVERY POCKET OF SOCIETY- THE PUSH BACK WILL BE WILL BE HEARD BUT IT'S CRITICAL THAT MALE ALLIES AND ESPECIALLY THIS NEXT GENERATION STEP UP AND SAY YOU KNOW I PERSONALLY. I BENEFITTED FROM PLANNED PARENTHOOD SERVICES MYSELF AND I'VE BEEN THROUGH TOUGH FAMILY PLANNING CHOICES. GROWING UP THROUGH YOU KNOW MY THREE YEAR THREE AND A HALF DECADES AROUND HERE. THESE ARE HARD THESE ARE HARD MOMENTS IN LIFE BUT THE LAST THING WE NEED IS GOVERNMENT COMING IN AND- INSERTING ITSELF INTO WHAT'S A VERY INTIMATE AND IMPORTANT HEALTH DECISIONS SO I JUST APPRECIATE YOU CONTINUOUSLY BANGING HIS DRUM HOPEFULLY CALIFORNIA BEHAVING BUT I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO BE YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE PLACE THAT. WOMEN CAN FEEL SAFE BUT- THANK YOU. RIGHT WITH THAT NO FURTHER COMMENTS- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE CENTER LEYVA THANK YOU MA'AM CHAIR OF THANK YOU MEMBERS.

AND DEMONIZED WOMEN WHO HAVE HAD ABORTIONS. I'M NOT EVER ASKING SOMEONE TO HAVE AN ABORTION YOU DO NOT HAVE TO HAVE AN ABORTION THE GENTLEMAN HERE DOES NOT HAVE TO HAVE AN ABORTION. BUT WOMEN SHOULD HAVE THAT CHOICE WE DON'T KNOW ANYONE'S LIFE HISTORY WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH BUT THAT WOMEN SHOULD HAVE THAT RIGHT AS I WAS CARRYING SB THREE TWENTY IN SB TWENTY FOUR. THROUGH THE PROCESS I BECAME MORE AND MORE ADAMANT AND AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE **** THAT I SAW WAS PUT ON WOMEN AND I'M TIRED OF THAT I'M TIRED OF WOMEN BEING SHAMED FOR TRIPS IS AT. MAKING FOR THEMSELVES THE FAMILY IT'S MY RIGHT IT'S NOT YOUR RIGHT IS THE RIGHT OF THE WOMAN WHO IS MAKING THAT DECISION WITH HER PHYSICIAN.

GOOD AFTERNOON. NICE TO SEE YOU AS WELL CARE HAPPY NEW YEAR I JEAN HEARST HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE VENTURA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS INS IN SUPPORT OF SENATOR STERN. SEVEN THE THREE. ACTION ISSUE I CAME TO LIGHT IN THE COUNTY OF INTER AFTER THE VERY DEVASTATING THOMAS FIRE- WHERE EVACUATION TEND TO BE VERY QUICK IS THE FIRST TIME BUYER- PERSONNEL AND ENGINES WERE ACTUALLY DEPLOYED TO EVACUATE- INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. AND THEY COUNTY LIE IS THAT IF THEY HAD ONLY HAD ADDITIONAL CONTACT I KEEP THE THIRTY. FOUR I'M EXISTING CLIENTS THAT WE CURRENTLY SIR AND ARE SO. SERVICES AND PROGRAMS I IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE IF WE COULD HAVE SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH FIRST FIRST FIRST I'M SENATOR JACKSON. OF KNOWS THAT WE'VE ATTEMPTED TO REMEDY- THIS ISSUE BUT IT CERTAINLY HAS COME TO- MORE URGENCY IN TERMS OF THE INITIATION OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF THAT OCCURRED THIS FALL- COUNTY FEELS. THAT IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CARE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS AND- WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO REACH THEM IN AN EMERGENCY. AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR I'VE- THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT- GOOD AFTERNOON JOHN KENNEDY ON BEHALF OF RC RC REPRESENTING THE STATE'S THIRTY SEVEN RURAL COUNTIES- WE'VE BORN A- IF YOU'RE A LARGE PORTION OF THE P. S. P. S. EVENTS. AND WERE PRIORITIZING NOTIFICATIONS AND MITIGATION OF THE IMPACTS TO A IF AND POPULATIONS SO WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL- AS IS CURRENTLY IN PRINT. OF THE AUTHOR'S INTENT HERE- TAPPING SAID REVIEWING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE WORK FROM AN IMPLEMENTATION PERSPECTIVE BUT ONE OF FLAG A COUPLE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE RESOLVED SO THAT WE AVOID UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. UP THE FIRST BEING THE OPT OUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE DESIRE FOR AN OPT OUT BUT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT FROM OUR LOCAL IT DIRECTORS- WHETHER THAT WILL BE A CHALLENGE WHETHER THEY'RE OPT OUT PROVISIONS IN PLACE NOW OR IF THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO CREATE THOSE CAPABILITIES- BECAUSE WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN REACH OUT TO THESE INDIVIDUALS. IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY SO REPORTER FINDING LANGUAGE ON THAT. AND THEN THE SECOND AMENDMENT THAT'S BEEN PROPOSED. WHICH WOULD CABIN THE THIS- COMMUNICATION CAPABILITY ON- SITUATIONS IN WHICH THERE NEEDS TO BE AN EVACUATION WE THINK THAT'S WHOLLY APPROPRIATE FOR A LARGE MAJORITY OF THE OTHER TYPES OF EMERGENCIES HERE. IT'S NOT REALLY WELL SUITED FOR PS PS EVENTS BECAUSE THE GENERAL POPULATION DOESN'T NEED TO BE EVACUATED BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS. SENSITIVE INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THAT POPULATION THAT MIGHT SO FINDING A WAY TO FACILITATE COMMUNICATIONS TO IT WAS A FUN POPULATIONS. FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSES OF NOTIFICATION AND SEEING IF PEOPLE NEED ASSISTANCE SO WITH THAT YOU KNOW WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE WITH THE AUTHOR- AND ALSO EXPLORING WAYS TO ENSURE THAT UTILITIES CAN HAVE SOME TYPE OF ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROVIDING NOTIFICATIONS AND D. S. P. S. OFFENSE AND SO AS LONG AS IT'S NARROWLY TAILORED. AND LIMITED TO NOTIFICATION AND PROTECTION OF ASSISTANCE WITH THERE'S A WILL THERE'S ALSO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR PRECIADO COMMITTEE TAKEN THE. SUB TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY THE WITNESS DOESN'T SUPPORT. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SING UP WILL BRING TO THE DYESS MISTER VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU CHAIR OF TWICE A ONE DAY CENTER STERN I'M VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOUR. YOUR EFFORTS. SINGER I'M NOT SURE WHO IT IS YEAH BUT. QUICK QUESTION DO WE HAVE IT. THE DEFINITION. OR CATEGORIES OF ELDERLY IS THERE AN AGE RANGE IS OVER SIXTY FIVE WHAT IS IT THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND YEAH BECAUSE I THINK HE'S REFERRING TO IN THE PROVISION OF THE WELFARE INSTITUTION BECAUSE THEY WERE TOUCHING.% WE'RE TALKING ABOUT POSSIBLE EVACUATIONS IN AREAS IN WHICH ELDERLY OR DISABLED CLIENTS RESERVE. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S TO FIND ELSEWHERE IN THE CODE I HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT ONE HE USES A HOUSEKEEPING ITEM IF MAYBE THERE MIGHT BE. SOME SORT OF REFERENCE THAT CAN BE CREATED THAT IDENTIFIES DISABLED- AND IN AGE RANGE YEAH DO YOU MIND ALSO FIVE WAIT MAYBE EIGHTY A MAYBE THAT'S IT. AND TERRIBLY FROM THE COUNTY'S PERSPECTIVE THESE ARE GONNA BE FOLKS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES SERVICES SO THEY HAVE TO BE- BOTH INCOME AND AGE AND CONDITION ELIGIBLE OKAY LAST QUESTION IS. RC RC ROB POINT ON OUT. EMERGENCY PERSONNEL. FOR IT CORRECT ME IF I'M MISTAKEN. THEY ARE NOT IN A POSITION OF NOT GOING TO SOMEONE'S HOME TO HELP EVACUATE IF THEY OPT OUT IT'S ALMOST AS IF WE COULD BE. ARE ABUSING AND WASTING RESOURCES WITH THE NOTION THAT SOMEONE CAN OPT OUT. UNDER THESE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES IF EMERGENCY PERSONNEL WOULD GO ANYWAYS. IT'S A FAIR POINT L. BUT ANYWAY JUST SOME OF YOU TO CONSIDER YEAH IT'S A GOOD IDEA MAYBE VENTURA COUNTY JUST WENT THROUGH THIS A FEW TIMES CAN WEIGH IN BECAUSE I I'M SENSITIVE TO. WELL MISTER KENNEDY REYES THERE TOO AND YOU DON'T TO ADD YOUR RESPECT TO SEE. RIGHT THAT'S DIVIDE AT THE SAME TIME. IF THE MECHANICS DON'T WORK AND YOUR- THEY'RE ALREADY GOING YOUR HOUSE ANYWAYS AND THEN THEY HAVE TO JUST FIND IT THROUGH SOME OTHER WAY DO YOU ADD ANOTHER. IN THIS IS THIS ISN'T ABOUT NOT GOING TO YOUR HOME THIS IS. THE ABILITY TO OPT OUT OF DISCLOSING THE INFORMATION. SO IN OTHER WORDS YOU'RE PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO BE BOTHERED BY GOVERNMENT I KNOW BUT IF FOR EXAMPLE EMERGENCY SERVICES. CANNOT SEND A MESSAGE THAT INDIVIDUAL ARE THEY NOT DâN OBLIGATED TO. TO GUARANTEE THE THAT SOMEONE IS EVACUATED THROUGH THE GOING DOOR TO DOOR. I UNDERSTAND. THAT'S WHAT YOU JUST SO MANY CONSIDERED NO BIG DEAL BUT JUST AMERICAN WHETHER IT'S A BIG DEAL TO THE EXTENT THAT WE WANT TO PROVIDE SERVICES SO IN RESPONSE TO THE FIRST QUESTION ABOUT AYE HSS THEY'VE ALREADY GOT A QUALIFY- UNDER THIS BILL AND THE OTHER THE OTHER THING AND THIS IS MODELED AFTER BILL THAT I'M HOPING YOU'LL BE WORKING WITH ME ON SEVEN NINETY FOUR WHICH IS A RE INTRODUCTION OF A BILL THAT I. DID LAST YEAR ADDRESSING MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE INFORMATION SO THE GOAL IS TO HAVE EVERYBODY BE NOTIFIED WHEN THERE IS AN EMERGENCY OR WHEN THERE'S A P. AT NOW WITH THERE'S A PS PS- AND BASICALLY INCLUDING EVERYONE UNLESS THEY DON'T WANT TO BE INCLUDED IN THE INFORMATION GIVING THEM THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT SO THAT THEIR INFORMATION WILL NOT BE IN THE DATABASE THE GOES OUT TO PEOPLE OUR HOPE OF COURSE IS THAT EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE NOTIFIED BUT WE DO HAVE SOME PEOPLE THAT WOULD RATHER NOT. AND WHAT THE OPT OUT PROVISION IS TO RESPECT THE RIGHT OF PEOPLE WHO DO NOT WANT TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE WON'T TRY TO HELP THEM DURING AN EMERGENCY JUST MEANS THEY HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO BE PART OF THE NOTIFICATION SYSTEM WHEN PEOPLE HAVE THESE EXTRA NEEDS AND HAVE OUR AYE HSS ELIGIBLE LAW ENFORCEMENT FIRST RESPONDERS HAVE MADE IT CLEAR TO US THEY REALLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE FIRST BECAUSE THEY'RE THE PEOPLE WHO NEED THE HELP MOST AND I THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS. A TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IN AGAIN I AM LOOKING TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS CONCEPT IT IN IN THE I THINK IT'S SEVEN NINETY FOUR WHICH IS A BILL I RE INTRODUCED OF THAT DEALS WITH ITS FIRST VACATION AS WELL CRITICALLY. IMPORTANT EVENT CHAIR I. YOU RAISE THE RIGHT. HOW TO. HOW TO. WE'RE NOT GONNA GET IN THE WAY DELIVERY THESE EMERGENCY SERVICES. BUT I TO FIND. A NIMBLE AND NOT CLUNKY WILL BE TO GIVE THAT OPT OUT. POINT SO IS IT UPON ENROLLMENT IF YOU KNOW THEIR ANNUAL ENROLLMENT PROCESS ALREADY HAPPENING CHAD NEED TO ADD A BOX TO LIKE WHERE THOSE MECHANICS ADDING WE WANT TO WORK WITH COMMITTEE AND YOU ON- TO MAKE THAT WORK BUT I WOULD ALSO REYES. THIS BILL IS LIMITED RIGHT NOW TO. NOTIFICATIONS ABOUT EVACUATIONS AND SO THE OTHER POINT THAT I THINK IS AYE AYE TAKE WELL FROM RC RC IS THAT. THE AID AND ASSISTANCE PART TWO MAY BE AN ISSUE SO IF THEY'RE NOT JUST EVACUATING YOU SAY FROM LIKE IN A P. S. P. S. INCIDENT THEY MAY NOT EXACTLY WHAT YOU. WRITE IT MAY NOT BE AN EVACUATION NOTIFICATION BUT IT MAY BE A NOTIFICATION LIKE YOUR POWERS ABOUT TO GO OFF AND YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE YOU GOT A GENERATOR ON SITE. SO AS THE AS IF THE BILL MOVES FOR WE JUST. I ONE OF. FLAG YOU MY OPEN THIS TO TRY TO WORK THROUGH THAT BECAUSE- THE- THE PEACE PS IS A DIFFERENT ANIMAL I GUESS THAN WE'VE SEEN. AS WAS THE GET OUT OF YOUR HOUSE MAYBE IT'S HUNKER DOWN AND STABLE WE GET WE GET NOTICES WHEN THERE'S GONNA BE A PS PS WE DON'T NECESSARILY GET NOTICES WHEN AWHILE FIRES JUST STARTED SO. SO THEY ARE THEY ARE DIFFERENT BUT IF. YOU LOOK AT SEVEN NINETY FOUR AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH RC RC ON THIS I THINK WE CAN INCORPORATE THE MALL IN THAT PROCESS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT I ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SEEING NON A- GROCERY RUN AYE VOTE ALL RIGHT WITH THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS PLEASE CALL THE ROLL JACKSON HI JACKSON AYE BORDERS. OR DECIDE TO RUSSELL GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I'D JONES. JONES I AM MONNING. MONEY AYE STERN. HE SAID THE- ALL RIGHT IF WE COULD CALL THE ABSENT MEMBERS ON FILE ITEM THREE. STERN STERN AYE WHY CASKEY RECOUNTS THE AYE RIGHT THAT IS EIGHT TWO ZERO THAT BILL IS OUT AND WE ARE ADJOURNED THANK YOU ALL
