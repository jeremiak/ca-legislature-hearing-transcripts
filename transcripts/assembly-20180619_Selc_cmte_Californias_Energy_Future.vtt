00:34:37.842 --> 00:34:39.444
THE HAND OUT JUST BRIEFLY SOME

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:40.411
BACKGROUND --

00:34:40.478 --> 00:34:42.847
LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD --

00:34:42.914 --> 00:34:44.248
FIRST CREATED BY THE AIR

00:34:44.315 --> 00:34:46.384
RESOURCES BOARD IN TWO THOUSAND

00:34:46.451 --> 00:34:47.452
NINE UNDER ITS A. B. THIRTY TWO

00:34:47.518 --> 00:34:49.320
AUTHORITY --

00:34:49.387 --> 00:34:49.821
TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS

00:34:49.887 --> 00:34:51.689
EMISSIONS AS PART OF A LARGER

00:34:51.756 --> 00:34:54.125
BROADER STRATEGY --

00:34:54.192 --> 00:34:54.625
FOR MEETING THE STATE'S

00:34:54.692 --> 00:34:55.593
GREENHOUSE GAS GOALS THAT

00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:56.360
INCLUDES A VARIETY OF OTHER

00:34:56.427 --> 00:34:58.096
POLICIES.

00:34:58.162 --> 00:34:59.831
INCLUDING CAP AND TRADE --

00:34:59.897 --> 00:35:01.132
RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD

00:35:01.199 --> 00:35:03.134
VEHICLE EFFICIENCY STANDARDS

00:35:03.201 --> 00:35:04.168
POLICIES TO TRY TO REDUCE

00:35:04.235 --> 00:35:06.304
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED --

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:07.305
THE GOAL OF THIS PARTICULAR

00:35:07.371 --> 00:35:08.840
PROGRAM IS REALLY TO REDUCE THE

00:35:08.906 --> 00:35:10.808
LIFECYCLE CARBON INTENSITY OF

00:35:10.875 --> 00:35:12.777
THE FUELS THEMSELVES SO --

00:35:12.844 --> 00:35:13.711
THERE'S ARE TARGETING ONE

00:35:13.778 --> 00:35:14.745
PARTICULAR ASPECT OF

00:35:14.812 --> 00:35:16.113
TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS AND

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:17.882
THAT'S WHERE THE CARBON

00:35:17.949 --> 00:35:19.684
INTENSITY OF THE FUEL SO NOT BID.

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:20.885
OFFICIALS IS A VEHICLES OR

00:35:20.952 --> 00:35:22.153
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED.

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:24.956
ARM AND THE WAY THE REGULATION

00:35:25.022 --> 00:35:27.291
DOES THIS IS THE CAR ESTABLISHES

00:35:27.358 --> 00:35:30.394
A OUT TO CARBON INTENSE ARE IS

00:35:30.461 --> 00:35:30.995
ESTABLISHES DIFFERENT CARBON

00:35:31.062 --> 00:35:32.296
INTENSITY BENCHMARKS --

00:35:32.363 --> 00:35:33.664
THERE'S ONE FOR GASOLINE THERE'S

00:35:33.731 --> 00:35:35.199
WILL SEPARATE ONE FOR DIESEL.

00:35:35.266 --> 00:35:36.801
AYE AND THOSE ARE ANNUAL

00:35:36.868 --> 00:35:39.270
BENCHMARKS OUT DECLINE.

00:35:39.337 --> 00:35:42.907
AND THEY ALSO MEASURE THE A OF

00:35:42.974 --> 00:35:43.808
DIFFERENT FUELS AND SORT OF

00:35:43.875 --> 00:35:45.176
MEASURE THAT CARBON INTENSITY

00:35:45.243 --> 00:35:47.678
RELATIVE TO THE BENCHMARK --

00:35:47.745 --> 00:35:49.814
AND AND AND SORT OF THAT TRY TO

00:35:49.881 --> 00:35:50.815
ACHIEVE THOSE STATEWIDE GOALS

00:35:50.882 --> 00:35:52.250
ARE SET OUT IN THE IN THE

00:35:52.316 --> 00:35:53.684
BENCHMARK --

00:35:53.751 --> 00:35:54.785
I THINK ONE KEY DIFFERENCE TO

00:35:54.852 --> 00:35:56.487
NOTE BETWEEN THE LCF US AND SOME

00:35:56.554 --> 00:35:57.889
OF THE OTHER.

00:35:57.955 --> 00:35:59.490
POLICIES THAT THE STATE HAS A

00:35:59.557 --> 00:36:00.458
FOR EXAMPLE CAP AND TRADE IS

00:36:00.525 --> 00:36:01.792
THAT THE EMISSIONS ARE MEASURED

00:36:01.859 --> 00:36:04.529
ON A LIFE CYCLE BASIS SO.

00:36:04.595 --> 00:36:05.162
IT'S NOT JUST OR THE MISSIONS

00:36:05.229 --> 00:36:06.197
ASSOCIATE WITH CONSUMING THE

00:36:06.264 --> 00:36:07.899
FUEL BUT ALL OF THE EMISSIONS

00:36:07.965 --> 00:36:10.268
ASSOCIATED WITH EXTRACTING AT

00:36:10.334 --> 00:36:11.002
FOR EXAMPLE FROM THE GROUND

00:36:11.068 --> 00:36:12.803
TRANSFORM A NET PROCESSING AT

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:14.372
REFINING AT ARMS OF THOSE

00:36:14.438 --> 00:36:15.573
EMISSIONS ARE COUNTED THOSE

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:16.541
PROGRAMMERS AND SOME OTHER

00:36:16.607 --> 00:36:18.509
PROGRAMS THOSE EMISSIONS ARE

00:36:18.576 --> 00:36:19.644
PART OF THE ACCOUNTING.

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:20.811
SO -- IF YOU

00:36:20.878 --> 00:36:23.848
TURN TO PAGE TWO OF THE HANDOUTS --

00:36:23.915 --> 00:36:26.117
SO HOW DOES THE PROGRAM --

00:36:26.183 --> 00:36:27.385
ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THESE

00:36:27.451 --> 00:36:29.453
STATEWIDE TARGETS AND BENCHMARKS

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.721
AYE WHICH ARE OURS CURRENTLY

00:36:30.788 --> 00:36:33.024
SCHEDULED TO GO DOWN TO A 10%

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:35.393
REDUCTION IN --

00:36:35.459 --> 00:36:36.027
TWENTY TWENTY IT REALLY CREATES

00:36:36.093 --> 00:36:37.828
AS A MARKET SYSTEM OF DEFICITS

00:36:37.895 --> 00:36:40.831
AND CREDITS FOR COMPLIANCE.

00:36:40.898 --> 00:36:44.635
ALSO CARP SETS A NEW STANDARD --

00:36:44.702 --> 00:36:46.203
AND AND CONVENTIONAL FUEL

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:47.438
SUPPLIERS --

00:36:47.505 --> 00:36:48.873
LARGELY RIGHT REFINERIES HAVE TO

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:50.341
MEET THAT STATEWIDE STANDARD OF

00:36:50.408 --> 00:36:53.277
THAT BENCHMARK --

00:36:53.344 --> 00:36:55.613
EXCEED THE OVERALL BENCHMARK

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.481
GENERATE DEFICITS --

00:36:57.548 --> 00:36:59.984
FUELS THAT ARE SUPPLIED THAT ARE

00:37:00.051 --> 00:37:01.352
BELOW THAT STATEWIDE NOT ARE

00:37:01.419 --> 00:37:02.253
BELOW THAT BENCHMARK GENERATE

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.821
CREDITS.

00:37:03.888 --> 00:37:05.489
AND OVERALL A AND UNITY

00:37:05.556 --> 00:37:07.224
DEMONSTRATES COMPLIANCE BY --

00:37:07.291 --> 00:37:09.594
OPINION ENOUGH CREDITS TO COVER

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.562
ITS OVERALL DEFICIT SO THE TABLE

00:37:11.629 --> 00:37:13.464
THAT YOU SEE AT THE TOP OF PAGE

00:37:13.531 --> 00:37:16.167
TWO KIND OF GIVES YOU A SENSE OF

00:37:16.233 --> 00:37:17.335
NO SOME OF THAT CARP AVERAGE

00:37:17.401 --> 00:37:18.669
CARBON INTENSITY FOR DIFFERENT

00:37:18.736 --> 00:37:19.770
TYPES OF FUELS SO YOU SEE THAT

00:37:19.837 --> 00:37:21.439
SORT OF MORE CONVENTIONAL FUEL

00:37:21.505 --> 00:37:21.739
THE DIESEL.

00:37:21.806 --> 00:37:24.141
AND GASOLINE ARE ABOVETHE

00:37:24.208 --> 00:37:26.677
BENCHMARKS FOR THOSE FUELS AND

00:37:26.744 --> 00:37:27.378
THEN YOU SEE COME UP AS YOU MOVE

00:37:27.445 --> 00:37:29.046
FURTHER DOWN THE LIST YOU'LL SEE

00:37:29.113 --> 00:37:30.681
THE AVERAGE CARBON INTENSITY FOR

00:37:30.748 --> 00:37:32.283
SOME OF THE ALTERNATIVE FUELS

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:33.284
WHERE -- IF

00:37:33.351 --> 00:37:34.185
THOSE FIELD OF SURPRISED THERE

00:37:34.251 --> 00:37:35.653
ARE CREDITS THAT ARE GENERATED

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:37.188
AND THEN THEY CAN BE USED TO

00:37:37.254 --> 00:37:38.155
COVER THE DEFICITS THAT ARE

00:37:38.222 --> 00:37:40.091
INCURRED BY PROVIDING A A MORE

00:37:40.157 --> 00:37:41.626
CONVENTIONAL HIGHER CARBON

00:37:41.692 --> 00:37:44.962
INTENSITY FUEL --

00:37:45.029 --> 00:37:45.763
AT DO JUST WANNA KNOW WITHIN

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:47.598
THESE BROADER CATEGORIES THAT

00:37:47.665 --> 00:37:48.532
ARE LISTED IN THE TABLE THERE

00:37:48.599 --> 00:37:51.535
ARE A WIDE VARIETY OF PATHWAYS --

00:37:51.602 --> 00:37:52.737
KIND OF WITHIN THOSE DIFFERENT

00:37:52.803 --> 00:37:54.405
CATEGORIES WHERE THE CARBON

00:37:54.472 --> 00:37:55.940
INTENSITY OF A PARTICULAR FUEL

00:37:56.007 --> 00:37:57.408
MIGHT DEPEND ON HOW THE RAW

00:37:57.475 --> 00:37:58.709
PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED TO

00:37:58.776 --> 00:38:00.011
PRODUCE THE FUEL WHERE IT'S

00:38:00.077 --> 00:38:01.812
WHERE IT'S COMING FROM THOSE

00:38:01.879 --> 00:38:03.447
TYPES OF THINGS SO.

00:38:03.514 --> 00:38:04.649
EITHER ARE ARE A WHITE RIGHT A

00:38:04.715 --> 00:38:06.784
DIFFERENCE OR CARBON INTENSITIES

00:38:06.851 --> 00:38:08.886
WITHIN EACH INDIVIDUAL CATEGORY.

00:38:08.953 --> 00:38:10.921
YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE OF YOUR

00:38:10.988 --> 00:38:12.590
HANDOUTS --

00:38:12.657 --> 00:38:15.660
THEY ARE REGULATED PARTIES --

00:38:15.726 --> 00:38:17.094
HAVE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT

00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:19.096
COMPLIANCE OPTIONS TO TRANSFER

00:38:19.163 --> 00:38:20.498
TO MEET THIS THIS TARGET THAT'S

00:38:20.564 --> 00:38:21.432
BEEN SET OUT AND COVER THE

00:38:21.499 --> 00:38:22.833
DEFICITS THAT THEY THAT ARE

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:24.735
INCURRED FROM PROVIDING HIGHER

00:38:24.802 --> 00:38:26.203
CARBON INTENSITY FUELS.

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:27.438
ARE THE INCLUDES --

00:38:27.505 --> 00:38:29.273
SUPPLYING LOWER CI FUELS SUCH AS

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:31.942
BLENDING LOWER CARBON INTENSITY --

00:38:32.009 --> 00:38:34.612
ETHANOL INTO GASOLINE AS ONE

00:38:34.679 --> 00:38:35.713
EXAMPLE --

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:36.781
IMPLEMENTING PROJECTS THAT

00:38:36.847 --> 00:38:39.016
REDUCE OUR CARBON INTENSITY FOR

00:38:39.083 --> 00:38:40.651
EXAMPLE --

00:38:40.718 --> 00:38:43.821
PROJECTS THAT MIGHT USE.

00:38:43.888 --> 00:38:45.089
OIL CAN BE --

00:38:45.156 --> 00:38:46.957
CAN GENERATE A CREDIT IN THOSE

00:38:47.024 --> 00:38:48.993
CREDITS CAN BE USED TO COMPLY --

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.828
AND THIRD PURCHASING PRODUCTS

00:38:50.895 --> 00:38:52.730
FROM A LOW CARBON FUEL SUPPLIERS

00:38:52.797 --> 00:38:54.098
THAT HAD GET CREDITS FROM SO AND

00:38:54.165 --> 00:38:55.700
THOSE THOSE FIELDS.

00:38:55.766 --> 00:38:58.169
ARE ALSO EXCESS CREDITS NOW

00:38:58.235 --> 00:38:59.170
THEY'RE GENERATING NEW YEAR THAT

00:38:59.236 --> 00:39:00.805
AREN'T USED CAN BE BANKS IN

00:39:00.871 --> 00:39:03.474
HOUSTON AND FUTURE YEARS AS WELL.

00:39:03.541 --> 00:39:04.775
I AM I THINK ONE OF THE THE KEY

00:39:04.842 --> 00:39:06.143
FEATURES OF THE PROGRAM AND SORT

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:07.712
OF THAT THE MAIN REASON WHY I

00:39:07.778 --> 00:39:08.713
THINK THE PROGRAM IS SET UP WITH

00:39:08.779 --> 00:39:09.413
THE SYSTEM OF DEFICITS AND

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:11.082
CREDITS.

00:39:11.148 --> 00:39:12.783
ARM IS THAT THE PROGRAM IS

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:13.517
REALLY INTENDED TO BE FUELED

00:39:13.584 --> 00:39:15.019
NEUTRAL.

00:39:15.086 --> 00:39:16.353
AREN'T MEANING THAT IT DOESN'T

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:18.222
REQUIRE ANY PARTICULAR FEEL BE

00:39:18.289 --> 00:39:19.924
USED TO MEET THE OVERALL CARBON

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:21.392
INTENSITY STANDARD.

00:39:21.459 --> 00:39:22.660
AND INSTEAD IT SORT OF PROVIDES

00:39:22.727 --> 00:39:23.327
THESE --

00:39:23.394 --> 00:39:24.762
INCENTIVES IN THE FORM OF CREDIT

00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:27.665
PRICES --

00:39:27.732 --> 00:39:28.899
FOR FOR AT INDUSTRIES OUT THERE

00:39:28.966 --> 00:39:30.401
TO PROVIDE THE MIX OF FUELS THAT

00:39:30.468 --> 00:39:32.136
ARE A LEAST COSTLY --

00:39:32.203 --> 00:39:32.536
NEED --

00:39:32.603 --> 00:39:34.071
WAITS ECONOMY THE OVERALL

00:39:34.138 --> 00:39:34.672
STANDARD THAT'S ESTABLISHED IN

00:39:34.739 --> 00:39:36.640
THE PROGRAM.

00:39:36.707 --> 00:39:38.609
SO -- NEXT

00:39:38.676 --> 00:39:39.944
I'LL MOVE ON TO PAGE FOUR OF

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:41.078
YOUR HANDOUT WHICH WAS REALLY

00:39:41.145 --> 00:39:42.213
JUST SORT OF THE BEGINNING OF

00:39:42.279 --> 00:39:43.347
JUST GIVING YOU SOME CONTEXT OF

00:39:43.414 --> 00:39:44.281
AND WHERE WE'VE BEEN IN THE

00:39:44.348 --> 00:39:46.050
PROGRAM SO FAR JUST AS FAR AS

00:39:46.117 --> 00:39:48.853
THE NOTE NUMBER OF CREDITS AND

00:39:48.919 --> 00:39:49.587
DEFICITS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:39:49.653 --> 00:39:50.621
GENERATED.

00:39:50.688 --> 00:39:51.856
I APOLOGIZE FOR THIS CHART THEIR

00:39:51.922 --> 00:39:55.392
RELEASED A QUARTER OVER THE LAST --

00:39:55.459 --> 00:39:57.595
FEW YEARS OF THE CREDITS ARE

00:39:57.661 --> 00:39:59.430
KIND OF A LIGHT SHADE IN YOUR IN

00:39:59.497 --> 00:40:00.831
YOUR CHART --

00:40:00.898 --> 00:40:02.166
BUT MAYBE FIRST OFF FOCUS ON

00:40:02.233 --> 00:40:03.467
SORT OF THE DARK BARS IN YOUR

00:40:03.534 --> 00:40:04.568
CHART WHICH IS KIND THE

00:40:04.635 --> 00:40:05.903
QUARTERLY DEFICITS THAT HAVE

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:07.605
BEEN GENERATED IN THE PROGRAM

00:40:07.671 --> 00:40:09.073
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS --

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.141
THOSE DEFICITS HAVE BEEN

00:40:10.207 --> 00:40:11.742
INCREASING.

00:40:11.809 --> 00:40:13.744
LARGELY AS A FUNCTION OF SORT OF

00:40:13.811 --> 00:40:15.846
WHEN THE A STANDARD BECOMES MORE

00:40:15.913 --> 00:40:18.249
STRINGENT EACH YEAR THAT MEANS

00:40:18.315 --> 00:40:19.250
YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE SUPPLYING A

00:40:19.316 --> 00:40:20.518
PARTICULAR GASOLINE FOR EXAMPLE

00:40:20.584 --> 00:40:22.319
THE NUMBER OF OF DEFICITS THAT

00:40:22.386 --> 00:40:24.488
ARE INCURRED. FOR THAT GALLON OF

00:40:24.555 --> 00:40:25.956
GASOLINE INCREASES AND SO SORT

00:40:26.023 --> 00:40:26.557
OF THE NUMBER OF DEATHS THAT

00:40:26.624 --> 00:40:27.958
DEFICITS INCREASES AS THE

00:40:28.025 --> 00:40:28.926
STANDARD BECOMES.

00:40:28.993 --> 00:40:31.295
MORE STRINGENT OVERTIME --

00:40:31.362 --> 00:40:33.030
THE SECOND POINT IS A NUMBER OF

00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:34.231
CREDITS YOU CAN SEE THEM ON SO

00:40:34.298 --> 00:40:36.267
THE LIGHT SHADED BARS ON THEIR

00:40:36.333 --> 00:40:37.067
HAVE ALSO BEEN INCREASING OVER

00:40:37.134 --> 00:40:38.135
TIME --

00:40:38.202 --> 00:40:39.770
REFLECTING SORT OF ADDITIONAL A

00:40:39.837 --> 00:40:41.672
LOW CARBON FUEL SUPPLY AND IN

00:40:41.739 --> 00:40:44.975
CALIFORNIA --

00:40:45.042 --> 00:40:46.310
YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

00:40:46.377 --> 00:40:47.745
THE CREDITS AND DEFICITS THAT

00:40:47.812 --> 00:40:48.646
HAVE BEEN GENERATED IN THE

00:40:48.712 --> 00:40:50.181
PROGRAM CREDITS HAVE EXCEEDED

00:40:50.247 --> 00:40:51.549
DEFICITS.

00:40:51.615 --> 00:40:53.584
FOR OUR ALMOST THE ENTIRETY OF

00:40:53.651 --> 00:40:55.719
THE PROGRAM IN SOME CASES --

00:40:55.786 --> 00:40:57.421
BY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT AS I

00:40:57.488 --> 00:40:59.123
MENTIONED BEFORE CREDITS THAT

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:00.424
ARE GENERATED BUT THAT ARGUES

00:41:00.491 --> 00:41:01.892
CAN BE BANKS AND USED IN FUTURE

00:41:01.959 --> 00:41:03.394
YEARS SO WE'RE IN A SITUATION

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:04.128
WHERE THERE IS.

00:41:04.195 --> 00:41:05.763
A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL BANK OF

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:07.364
CREDITS THAT HAVE BEEN USED BUT

00:41:07.431 --> 00:41:07.832
THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR

00:41:07.898 --> 00:41:08.499
COMPLIANCE.

00:41:08.566 --> 00:41:10.701
I IN FUTURE YEARS.

00:41:10.768 --> 00:41:12.269
ARM AND THEN FINALLY IF YOU LOOK

00:41:12.336 --> 00:41:14.038
AT SORT OF THE VERY RIGHT HAND

00:41:14.104 --> 00:41:17.741
SIDE OF YOUR CHART YOU'LL SEE --

00:41:17.808 --> 00:41:19.143
AT TOWARDS THE END OF TWENTY

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:19.977
SEVENTEEN THE PROGRAM REACHED A

00:41:20.044 --> 00:41:22.780
POINT WHERE THE LEVEL OF

00:41:22.847 --> 00:41:24.915
DEFICITS ACTUALLY EXCEEDED IN

00:41:24.982 --> 00:41:26.417
SOME QUARTERS THE LEVEL CREDITS

00:41:26.483 --> 00:41:27.985
THAT WERE GENERATED IN SO THAT'S

00:41:28.052 --> 00:41:29.220
A YOU USE THAT YOU KIND OF SEE

00:41:29.286 --> 00:41:30.888
THOSE ARE CONVERGING AND SO

00:41:30.955 --> 00:41:32.156
THAT'S PART OF THE FUNCTION OF

00:41:32.223 --> 00:41:32.656
THE PROGRAM.

00:41:32.723 --> 00:41:35.059
BECOMING A MORE STRINGENT --

00:41:35.125 --> 00:41:37.228
AND SNOW MOVING FORWARD IT IF

00:41:37.294 --> 00:41:37.828
THAT CONTINUES TO BE THE CASE

00:41:37.895 --> 00:41:39.263
THEN SOME OF THE OPTIONS ARE

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:40.397
USING SOME OF THE BANKS CREDITS

00:41:40.464 --> 00:41:41.799
TO COMPLY.

00:41:41.866 --> 00:41:43.133
WITH THE PROGRAM --

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.402
IT ALSO [inaudible]

00:41:45.469 --> 00:41:47.838
COURAGE AND BRING IN MORE LOW

00:41:47.905 --> 00:41:48.939
CARBON FUELS THE MARKET

00:41:49.006 --> 00:41:51.442
POTENTIALLY.

00:41:51.508 --> 00:41:54.178
SO TURN TO PAGE FIVE OF YOUR

00:41:54.245 --> 00:41:55.446
HANDOUT --

00:41:55.512 --> 00:41:56.947
SO I JUST TALKED ABOUT AND OF

00:41:57.014 --> 00:41:58.515
THE OVERALL LEVEL OF CREDITS

00:41:58.582 --> 00:41:59.617
THAT ARE GENERATED THIS IS

00:41:59.683 --> 00:42:00.985
REALLY JUST A FIGURE TRYING TO

00:42:01.051 --> 00:42:02.353
GIVE YOU A SENSE OF YOU KNOW

00:42:02.419 --> 00:42:03.287
WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF THOSE

00:42:03.354 --> 00:42:05.289
CREDITS WHAT TYPES OF OF FUELS

00:42:05.356 --> 00:42:07.491
HAVE BEEN USED TO COMPLY WITH

00:42:07.558 --> 00:42:08.325
THE REGULATION --

00:42:08.392 --> 00:42:10.361
YOU'LL SEE IT'S A A MIX OF YOU

00:42:10.427 --> 00:42:11.595
KNOW A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT

00:42:11.662 --> 00:42:13.163
FUELS THAT BIGGEST ONE BEING

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:14.431
EFFORT ALSO FAR BUT ALSO

00:42:14.498 --> 00:42:15.933
RENEWABLE DIESEL.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.068
BIODIESEL LECTURE CITY.

00:42:18.135 --> 00:42:21.639
AND BIO METHANE.

00:42:21.705 --> 00:42:22.373
AND THOSE HAVE BEEN ARE

00:42:22.439 --> 00:42:23.774
INCREASING --

00:42:23.841 --> 00:42:27.044
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS.

00:42:27.111 --> 00:42:30.147
SO PAGE SIX OF YOUR HANDOUTS --

00:42:30.214 --> 00:42:32.116
GIVES YOU A SENSE OF WHAT THE

00:42:32.182 --> 00:42:33.450
PRICES FOR CREDITS IN THE

00:42:33.517 --> 00:42:35.686
PROGRAM HAVE BEEN OVER THE LAST

00:42:35.753 --> 00:42:37.588
SEVERAL YEARS AND I THINK THAT

00:42:37.655 --> 00:42:38.222
THE FIRST THING THAT JUMPS OUT

00:42:38.289 --> 00:42:40.991
IS THE SIGNIFICANT VARIATION AND

00:42:41.058 --> 00:42:42.393
THE CREDIT PRICES OVER THE PAST

00:42:42.459 --> 00:42:45.095
SEVERAL YEARS --

00:42:45.162 --> 00:42:46.263
IN THEORY --

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:47.765
NEAR THE CREDIT PRICE REALLY

00:42:47.831 --> 00:42:49.566
SORT OF REFLECTS THE COST OF

00:42:49.633 --> 00:42:51.402
PROVIDING THAT LAST UNIT OF

00:42:51.468 --> 00:42:53.337
LOWER CARBON FUEL ARE THAT LAST

00:42:53.404 --> 00:42:54.805
CREDIT IN ORDER TO MEET THE

00:42:54.872 --> 00:42:55.639
STANDARDS THAT ARE SET AND THE

00:42:55.706 --> 00:42:57.408
PROGRAM --

00:42:57.474 --> 00:42:58.509
SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT REALLY

00:42:58.575 --> 00:43:00.511
KIND OF DRIVE THOSE PRICES THEY

00:43:00.577 --> 00:43:02.313
COULD REALLY BE ON SORT OF THE

00:43:02.379 --> 00:43:04.248
DEMAND OR SUPPLY SIDE FOR CREDIT

00:43:04.315 --> 00:43:05.849
SO -- FOR

00:43:05.916 --> 00:43:07.985
EXAMPLE SORT OF YOU KNOW AT THE

00:43:08.052 --> 00:43:09.486
JUST THE OVERALL STRINGENCY OF

00:43:09.553 --> 00:43:11.355
THE PROGRAM MEANS THAT NO MORE

00:43:11.422 --> 00:43:12.756
DEFICITS ARE CREATED AND THAT

00:43:12.823 --> 00:43:13.791
MEANS THERE'S A GREATER DEMAND

00:43:13.857 --> 00:43:15.292
FOR PRICES AND SO THAT.

00:43:15.359 --> 00:43:17.094
THAT HAS THE EFFECT OF THE

00:43:17.161 --> 00:43:18.796
PUSHING UP PRICES ALL ELSE EQUAL.

00:43:18.862 --> 00:43:20.497
ARE ON THE FLIPSIDE NEAR THINGS

00:43:20.564 --> 00:43:21.999
THAT AFFECT THE SUPPLY OF OF

00:43:22.066 --> 00:43:24.034
CREDITS IT'S REALLY --

00:43:24.101 --> 00:43:25.369
YOU KNOW THE AVAILABILITY AND

00:43:25.436 --> 00:43:27.771
COST OF DIFFERENT LOW CARBON

00:43:27.838 --> 00:43:29.239
FUEL OPTIONS THAT ARE OUT THERE

00:43:29.306 --> 00:43:30.975
ARE COMPLIANCE OPTIONS THAT ARE

00:43:31.041 --> 00:43:31.909
OUT THERE SUCH A EXTENT THERE'S

00:43:31.976 --> 00:43:32.910
A A BREAKTHROUGH IN SORT OF AN

00:43:32.977 --> 00:43:35.379
ABILITY TO PROVIDE.

00:43:35.446 --> 00:43:36.814
LOW COSTS CREDITS ARE LOW COST

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:39.049
FUELS --

00:43:39.116 --> 00:43:40.317
THEN THAT --

00:43:40.384 --> 00:43:41.785
ALMOST EQUAL HAS THE EFFECT OF

00:43:41.852 --> 00:43:44.154
OF PUSHING ALLOWS CRISIS DOWN I

00:43:44.221 --> 00:43:45.689
THINK SOME OF THE THE KEY

00:43:45.756 --> 00:43:47.291
FACTORS THAT I WOULDN'T SORT OF

00:43:47.358 --> 00:43:49.226
CLAIM TO KNOW ALL THE DIFFERENT

00:43:49.293 --> 00:43:50.361
FACTORS THAT HAVE DRIVEN.

00:43:50.427 --> 00:43:51.962
CHANGES ON ALLOWANCE PRICES THAT

00:43:52.029 --> 00:43:53.931
YOU SEE IN THE CHART HERE.

00:43:53.998 --> 00:43:55.733
I THINK A LOT OF THEM THAT ARE

00:43:55.799 --> 00:43:57.334
DUE TO KIND OF REGULATE CHANGES

00:43:57.401 --> 00:43:58.702
AND SORT OF THE STRINGENCY OR

00:43:58.769 --> 00:44:00.504
SORT CHANGES IN REGULATION THAT

00:44:00.571 --> 00:44:01.105
AFFECT THE STRINGENCY OF THE

00:44:01.171 --> 00:44:02.573
PROGRAM --

00:44:02.639 --> 00:44:05.009
THERE IS A PERIOD OF A FEW YEARS

00:44:05.075 --> 00:44:06.276
AGO WHERE THE COURT KIND OF

00:44:06.343 --> 00:44:08.045
FROZE THE STRINGENCY OF THE

00:44:08.112 --> 00:44:10.347
PROGRAM WHILE CARB HAD --

00:44:10.414 --> 00:44:12.149
TO REASSESS --

00:44:12.216 --> 00:44:13.317
YES AND ADDRESS SOME SEQUEL --

00:44:13.384 --> 00:44:16.420
AND APA ISSUES AND SO --

00:44:16.487 --> 00:44:17.588
I THINK THAT WAS SORT OF AROUND

00:44:17.654 --> 00:44:18.689
THE TIME WE SEE CAN SEE PRICES

00:44:18.756 --> 00:44:20.124
GOING DOWN THAN CARPET TO KIND

00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:21.592
OF RE ADOPT THE PROGRAM AND

00:44:21.658 --> 00:44:22.993
ESTABLISH.

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:23.927
I SOME DIFFERENT BENCHMARKS

00:44:23.994 --> 00:44:25.195
GOING FORWARD AND SOME OF THOSE

00:44:25.262 --> 00:44:26.563
WERE A FAIRLY STRINGENT AS OC

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:27.898
SORT OF IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF

00:44:27.965 --> 00:44:29.433
YEARS AND SO THAT YOU KNOW HAS

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.135
THE EFFECT OF OF POTENTIALLY A

00:44:31.201 --> 00:44:32.836
MOVING PRICES UPWARD SO IT'S A

00:44:32.903 --> 00:44:33.904
MIX OF SORT OF REGULATORY

00:44:33.971 --> 00:44:35.239
CHANGES LARGEST MARKET --

00:44:35.305 --> 00:44:37.708
MARKET FORCES THAT DRIVE SOME

00:44:37.775 --> 00:44:40.444
THE CHANGES AN ALLOWANCE PRIZES.

00:44:40.511 --> 00:44:41.211
AND THEN OF COURSE SAYS SINCE

00:44:41.278 --> 00:44:43.514
CREDIT CAN BE BANKS THE YA

00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:46.250
PRICES AND SENT TO SOME DEGREE.

00:44:46.316 --> 00:44:47.518
ABOUT THE FUTURE AND WHERE IT'S

00:44:47.584 --> 00:44:48.085
OUR FUTURE PRICES WILL BE AS

00:44:48.152 --> 00:44:50.821
WELL.

00:44:50.888 --> 00:44:52.623
SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE SEVEN OF

00:44:52.689 --> 00:44:54.458
YOUR HANDOUTS --

00:44:54.525 --> 00:44:55.526
THE COMMITTEE HAS ASKED US TO

00:44:55.592 --> 00:44:56.693
COME IN ON TO SO THAT THE CUTS

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:58.028
IN THE COST CONTAINMENT --

00:44:58.095 --> 00:44:59.663
PROVISIONS IN THE REGULATION I

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:00.764
THINK PROP.

00:45:00.831 --> 00:45:02.633
PERHAPS THE MOST NOTABLE ONE IS

00:45:02.699 --> 00:45:03.967
THE CREDIT CLEARANCE MARKET

00:45:04.034 --> 00:45:06.236
WHICH IS INTENDED TO LIMIT COSTS.

00:45:06.303 --> 00:45:07.738
IN SOME RESPECTS SO GENERALLY

00:45:07.805 --> 00:45:09.740
PARTIES CAN OUTSIDE OF THE

00:45:09.807 --> 00:45:11.742
CRITICAL ACTS MARKET CAN --

00:45:11.809 --> 00:45:12.943
INSURANCE AGREEMENTS WITH EACH

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:15.312
OTHER TO BUY AND SELL CREDITS --

00:45:15.379 --> 00:45:16.747
HOWEVER IF A REGULATED PARTY

00:45:16.814 --> 00:45:17.681
DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH CREDITS TO

00:45:17.748 --> 00:45:19.316
COMPLY IT CAN PURCHASE

00:45:19.383 --> 00:45:20.651
ADDITIONAL CREDITS TO THIS SORT

00:45:20.717 --> 00:45:21.218
OF SEPARATE CREDIT CLARENCE

00:45:21.285 --> 00:45:23.353
MARKET --

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:25.622
AND SPORTY'S CAN ELECT TO SELL

00:45:25.689 --> 00:45:27.291
THEIR THE CREDITS IF THEY HAVE

00:45:27.357 --> 00:45:29.293
FOR A PRICE OF UP TO TWO HUNDRED

00:45:29.359 --> 00:45:30.594
DOLLARS IN THE CREDIT CLARENCE

00:45:30.661 --> 00:45:31.428
MARKET SO.

00:45:31.495 --> 00:45:33.697
I AM I GET TED JUST KIND OF SOME

00:45:33.764 --> 00:45:34.865
SOME OF OUR GENERAL COMMENTS ON

00:45:34.932 --> 00:45:36.133
KIND OF FEEL HOW EFFECTIVE WE

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:38.068
THINK THAT MIGHT BE IN JUST --

00:45:38.135 --> 00:45:39.570
CONTAINING COSTS BUT IT'S THE

00:45:39.636 --> 00:45:43.073
THE THE GENERAL STRUCTURE OF IT.

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:45.576
SO YOU TURN TO PAGE --

00:45:45.642 --> 00:45:47.211
EIGHT OF THE HAND OUT JUST A

00:45:47.277 --> 00:45:48.979
COUPLE OF VERY BRIEF COMMENTS OF

00:45:49.046 --> 00:45:50.414
JUST THE OVERALL --

00:45:50.481 --> 00:45:53.383
AND ECONOMIC CONCEPTS BEHIND THE

00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:54.952
AND THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD

00:45:55.018 --> 00:45:56.587
I MEAN IT ESSENTIALLY --

00:45:56.653 --> 00:45:58.088
IT HAS THE EFFECT OF INCREASING

00:45:58.155 --> 00:45:59.923
COSTS FOR HIGHER CARBON FUEL

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:01.992
SUPPLIERS AND REDUCING COSTS FOR

00:46:02.059 --> 00:46:04.027
LOWER CARBON FUEL SUPPLIERS --

00:46:04.094 --> 00:46:05.129
YET THE INCENTIVES WHICH ARE

00:46:05.195 --> 00:46:06.230
PROVIDED IN THE FORM OF CREDIT

00:46:06.296 --> 00:46:08.732
PRICES WHICH ARE BOUGHT AND SOLD.

00:46:08.799 --> 00:46:09.366
ARE DISCOURAGED PRODUCTION AND

00:46:09.433 --> 00:46:11.768
CONSUMPTION OF THE GOALS AND

00:46:11.835 --> 00:46:13.537
COURAGE THAT PRODUCTION OF THE

00:46:13.604 --> 00:46:15.772
LOWER CARBON FUELS --

00:46:15.839 --> 00:46:17.341
AND SO IN THAT WAY IT MOVED UP

00:46:17.407 --> 00:46:18.008
PROGRAM COMMIT THOUGHT SORT OF A

00:46:18.075 --> 00:46:19.376
YOU KNOW SOMETHING OF A CHARGE

00:46:19.443 --> 00:46:21.245
ON KIND OF HIGHER CARBON FUELS

00:46:21.311 --> 00:46:22.746
AND AND AND THEN SORT OF

00:46:22.813 --> 00:46:23.981
PROVIDING IT'S AN AD FOR LOWER

00:46:24.047 --> 00:46:25.582
CARBON FUELS --

00:46:25.649 --> 00:46:27.117
SELF JUST AS AN EXAMPLE WE

00:46:27.184 --> 00:46:28.452
HIGHLIGHTED IN THAT --

00:46:28.519 --> 00:46:29.653
IN THE HANDOUT SORT OF THAT

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.688
CREDIT PRICES OF A HUNDRED FIFTY

00:46:31.755 --> 00:46:32.990
DOLLARS WHICH IS YOU KNOW

00:46:33.056 --> 00:46:33.557
SOMEWHERE IN THERE IN THE

00:46:33.624 --> 00:46:34.992
NEIGHBORHOOD OF WHERE CREDIT

00:46:35.058 --> 00:46:36.660
PRICES ARE NOW --

00:46:36.727 --> 00:46:38.195
THE PROGRAM LIKELY ADS SEVERAL

00:46:38.262 --> 00:46:39.963
CENTS PER GALLON TO THE PRICE OF

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:41.832
DIESEL FOR EXAMPLE --

00:46:41.899 --> 00:46:43.200
BUT THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE NOW

00:46:43.267 --> 00:46:44.501
THAT CREDIT GENERATING FUELS THE

00:46:44.568 --> 00:46:46.703
LOWER CARBON FUELS FOR EXAMPLE A

00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:49.640
FUEL WITH CARBON INTENSITY OF OF

00:46:49.706 --> 00:46:50.807
THIRTY CAN GET KIND OF A BENEFIT

00:46:50.874 --> 00:46:51.909
OF OVER A DOLLAR PER GALLON

00:46:51.975 --> 00:46:53.544
ASSOCIATED WITH SELLING THE

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:54.178
CREDITS THAT ARE GENERATED FROM

00:46:54.244 --> 00:46:55.646
THAT -- FROM

00:46:55.712 --> 00:46:56.547
THAT FUEL CELL AND JUST TO GIVE

00:46:56.613 --> 00:46:57.481
YOU A SENSE OF CALM THE ROUGH

00:46:57.548 --> 00:46:59.550
ORDER OF MAGNITUDE OF THINGS AS

00:46:59.616 --> 00:47:01.018
THEY STAND RIGHT NOW --

00:47:01.084 --> 00:47:02.052
AND THIS IS ALL DONE THROUGH

00:47:02.119 --> 00:47:03.420
SORT OF THAT THE REGULATORY

00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:04.788
MARKET THAT'S ESTABLISH SORT OF

00:47:04.855 --> 00:47:05.822
THE GENERATING OF PRODUCTS IN

00:47:05.889 --> 00:47:07.824
BUYING AND SELLING OF PRODUCTS.

00:47:07.891 --> 00:47:09.426
UNLIKE FOR EXAMPLE THE ANNUAL

00:47:09.493 --> 00:47:11.295
CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM WHICH IS

00:47:11.361 --> 00:47:12.863
ANOTHER MARKET BASED SYSTEM NONE

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:13.997
OF THIS YEAR REALLY SORT OF

00:47:14.064 --> 00:47:15.766
TOUCH AS A STATE ACCOUNT THERE'S

00:47:15.832 --> 00:47:16.900
NO YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT REVENUE

00:47:16.967 --> 00:47:18.669
COMING INTO A STATE ACCOUNT THEN

00:47:18.735 --> 00:47:19.636
THE LEGISLATURE ALLOCATES IT'S

00:47:19.703 --> 00:47:20.704
BUT ALL SET UP THROUGH A

00:47:20.771 --> 00:47:21.205
REGULATORY.

00:47:21.271 --> 00:47:22.806
STRUCTURE AND BUYING AND SELLING

00:47:22.873 --> 00:47:23.807
OF CREDITS FROM --

00:47:23.874 --> 00:47:24.741
PARTIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE

00:47:24.808 --> 00:47:28.045
REGULATION.

00:47:28.111 --> 00:47:29.846
OF TURN TO PAGE NINE OF YOUR

00:47:29.913 --> 00:47:32.182
HAND OUT --

00:47:32.249 --> 00:47:33.250
I'LL JUST TOUCH ON SOME OF THE

00:47:33.317 --> 00:47:34.952
MAJOR CHANGES THAT CARP IS

00:47:35.018 --> 00:47:36.320
PROPOSING TO THE REGULATION AND

00:47:36.386 --> 00:47:39.656
ITS CURRENT REGULATORY PACKAGE --

00:47:39.723 --> 00:47:42.326
THE FIRST THING IS RELIGIOUS THE

00:47:42.392 --> 00:47:44.428
THE PROGRAM TARGETS THEMSELVES

00:47:44.494 --> 00:47:46.296
OF THE LEVEL OF CARBON INTENSITY

00:47:46.363 --> 00:47:47.664
REDUCTION THAT ARE --

00:47:47.731 --> 00:47:49.633
IN THE REGULATION.

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:52.102
AND THE SOLID BLACK LINE THAT

00:47:52.169 --> 00:47:53.570
YOU SEE KIND OF SHOWS THE

00:47:53.637 --> 00:47:56.540
CURRENT REGULATION AND THE LEVEL

00:47:56.607 --> 00:47:58.709
OF CARBON INTENSITY REDUCTION --

00:47:58.775 --> 00:47:59.209
STANDARD THAT'S IN THAT

00:47:59.276 --> 00:48:00.410
REGULATION.

00:48:00.477 --> 00:48:02.112
I YOU CAN SEE --

00:48:02.179 --> 00:48:03.614
THAT THERE'S A PRETTY STEEP

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:06.416
DECLINE AND SORT OF THE THE

00:48:06.483 --> 00:48:08.085
CARBON INTENSITY REQUIREMENTS --

00:48:08.151 --> 00:48:11.989
COME BETWEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND

00:48:12.055 --> 00:48:13.123
TWENTY OTHERS THE 10% REDUCTION

00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:14.224
STANDARD THAT IT'S KIND OF IN

00:48:14.291 --> 00:48:15.826
THE CURRENT REGULATION THAT

00:48:15.892 --> 00:48:17.394
WOULD CONTINUE OUT.

00:48:17.461 --> 00:48:17.894
TO TWENTY THIRTY ARE THE

00:48:17.961 --> 00:48:19.696
PROPOSAL WHICH IS THE DOTTED

00:48:19.763 --> 00:48:22.399
LINE AND THE CHART --

00:48:22.466 --> 00:48:23.934
YOU CAN SEE IS OUT LESS

00:48:24.001 --> 00:48:25.602
STRINGENT OVER THE NEXT FEW

00:48:25.669 --> 00:48:28.238
YEARS SO FOR NOW 201-8 THROUGH

00:48:28.305 --> 00:48:29.706
OTHER EARLY TWENTY TWENTIES.

00:48:29.773 --> 00:48:30.707
AND THEN --

00:48:30.774 --> 00:48:31.808
BUT THEN SORT OF ESTABLISHES

00:48:31.875 --> 00:48:34.111
THESE LONGER TERM TARGETS ON

00:48:34.177 --> 00:48:35.045
CARBON INTENSITY CARBON

00:48:35.112 --> 00:48:37.614
INTENSITY REDUCTIONS OUT TO

00:48:37.681 --> 00:48:39.616
TWENTY THIRTY TWO A 20%

00:48:39.683 --> 00:48:41.652
REDUCTION OUT.

00:48:41.718 --> 00:48:42.152
TO TWENTY THIRTY SO --

00:48:42.219 --> 00:48:43.654
THAT I THINK THE RATIONALE AND

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:44.388
OF THAT --

00:48:44.454 --> 00:48:45.822
CARB IT'S PRESENTED IS REALLY

00:48:45.889 --> 00:48:47.724
THAT KIND OF THIS APPROACH WOULD

00:48:47.791 --> 00:48:49.426
AT TEND TO SORT OF SMOOTH --

00:48:49.493 --> 00:48:51.328
SOME OF THE PRICES OUT OVER THE

00:48:51.395 --> 00:48:52.829
LONG RUN --

00:48:52.896 --> 00:48:53.797
AND STABILIZE SOME OF THE

00:48:53.864 --> 00:48:55.132
INCENTIVES AND PROVIDE MORE

00:48:55.198 --> 00:48:56.933
STABLE INCENTIVES --

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.201
FOR FOR THE DIFFERENT PARTIES

00:48:58.268 --> 00:48:58.702
THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE

00:48:58.769 --> 00:49:00.904
REGULATION AND ALSO PREVENT SOME

00:49:00.971 --> 00:49:01.972
POTENTIALLY SOME SHORT TERM

00:49:02.039 --> 00:49:04.608
PRICE SPIKES IN THE NEAR TERM.

00:49:04.675 --> 00:49:05.809
WILL ALSO AND OF A TRADING

00:49:05.876 --> 00:49:07.411
LONGER TERM REDUCTIONS AS PART

00:49:07.477 --> 00:49:08.712
OF THE THAT STATE'S OVERALL GOAL

00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:09.913
TO MEET ITS TWENTY THIRTY

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:12.883
GREENHOUSE GAS TARGETS.

00:49:12.949 --> 00:49:15.652
SO ARE YOU TURN TO PAGE TEN OF

00:49:15.719 --> 00:49:17.821
YOUR HANDOUTS --

00:49:17.888 --> 00:49:19.489
LET ME TOUCH ON ALL THE OTHER

00:49:19.556 --> 00:49:20.757
REGULATORY CHANGES DELTA

00:49:20.824 --> 00:49:22.159
HIGHLIGHT KIND OF THE FIRST TWO

00:49:22.225 --> 00:49:23.760
THAT ARE HERE --

00:49:23.827 --> 00:49:26.029
THERE IS A PROPOSAL TO CREATE A

00:49:26.096 --> 00:49:28.432
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE FUELING

00:49:28.498 --> 00:49:29.733
INFRASTRUCTURE CREDIT SO.

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:30.801
THAT WOULD BE KIND OF CREDITS

00:49:30.867 --> 00:49:33.870
AVAILABLE FOR NEW HYDROGEN AND

00:49:33.937 --> 00:49:36.073
DC FAST CHARGER ELECTRIC VEHICLE

00:49:36.139 --> 00:49:38.075
CHARGING STATIONS --

00:49:38.141 --> 00:49:38.608
SO THOSE CREDITS WOULD BE

00:49:38.675 --> 00:49:39.409
AVAILABLE.

00:49:39.476 --> 00:49:40.911
ARE BASED ON SORT THE CAPACITY

00:49:40.977 --> 00:49:43.447
OF THOSE NEW FUELING STATIONS.

00:49:43.513 --> 00:49:45.582
I AND I THINK IT'S A SIGNIFICANT

00:49:45.649 --> 00:49:47.918
BECAUSE THIS IS A A PRETTY

00:49:47.984 --> 00:49:49.353
SIGNIFICANT DEPARTURE FROM KIND

00:49:49.419 --> 00:49:51.388
OF THE WAY THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN

00:49:51.455 --> 00:49:52.622
OPERATED TO DATE WHICH IS REALLY.

00:49:52.689 --> 00:49:56.126
THAT THERE'S A HEAVY EMPHASIS ON

00:49:56.193 --> 00:49:57.694
THE EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:49:57.761 --> 00:49:59.529
PROVIDING AND THE COMPETENCY IS

00:49:59.596 --> 00:50:00.430
SUCH A WITH PROVIDING THE ACTUAL

00:50:00.497 --> 00:50:02.799
FUEL AND THEIR CREDITS ARE TIED

00:50:02.866 --> 00:50:04.501
TO KIND OF PROVIDING THAT FUEL

00:50:04.568 --> 00:50:06.002
OR IMPLEMENT SOME PROJECT.

00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:06.937
THE KIND OF REDUCES THOSE

00:50:07.003 --> 00:50:09.940
EMISSIONS IN THIS CASE --

00:50:10.006 --> 00:50:11.041
THERE'S SOMETHING OF A SHIFT

00:50:11.108 --> 00:50:11.942
WHERE CREDITS WILL BE PROVIDED

00:50:12.008 --> 00:50:12.876
BY JUST HAVING THE

00:50:12.943 --> 00:50:14.344
INFRASTRUCTURE AVAILABLE THAT

00:50:14.411 --> 00:50:15.645
COULD PROVIDE THE FUEL EVEN IF

00:50:15.712 --> 00:50:16.780
IT'S NOT ACTUALLY.

00:50:16.847 --> 00:50:18.415
PROVIDING PROVIDING THAT FEELS

00:50:18.482 --> 00:50:19.716
THAT TOOK A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

00:50:19.783 --> 00:50:21.451
PHILOSOPHICAL A SHIFT IN THE

00:50:21.518 --> 00:50:23.954
PROGRAM --

00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:25.756
AND THE SECOND ISSUE IS THAT

00:50:25.822 --> 00:50:26.790
THAT THERE ARE EXCUSE ME THE

00:50:26.857 --> 00:50:27.891
SECOND --

00:50:27.958 --> 00:50:28.925
PROPOSED CHANGE THAT IS

00:50:28.992 --> 00:50:29.793
HIGHLIGHTED HERE IS JUST

00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:30.660
CHANGING SOME OF THE FUELS THAT

00:50:30.727 --> 00:50:32.229
ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROGRAM AND

00:50:32.295 --> 00:50:33.330
CAN -- FOR

00:50:33.397 --> 00:50:34.631
EXAMPLE GENERATE CREDITS TO THE

00:50:34.698 --> 00:50:36.633
PROGRAM SO --

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:37.267
THERE WOULD BE A CHANGE OF WHAT

00:50:37.334 --> 00:50:38.969
HAD FOR EXAMPLE ALTERNATIVE JET

00:50:39.035 --> 00:50:40.537
FUEL WOULD NOW BE SORT OF AN

00:50:40.604 --> 00:50:41.805
ELIGIBLE FUEL FOR THE PROGRAM

00:50:41.872 --> 00:50:43.273
WHERE IT COULD --

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:44.975
GENERATE CREDITS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:50:45.041 --> 00:50:46.710
SORT OF LOWER CARBON JET FUEL

00:50:46.777 --> 00:50:48.412
AND RIGHT NOW THAT'S THAT'S

00:50:48.478 --> 00:50:48.945
CURRENTLY NOT PART OF THE

00:50:49.012 --> 00:50:51.415
PROGRAM --

00:50:51.481 --> 00:50:55.185
AND I THINK UP PRICE MOVE ON TO

00:50:55.252 --> 00:50:57.354
THE NEXT PAGE PAGE --

00:50:57.421 --> 00:50:58.855
ELEVEN JUST TOUCH BRIEFLY ON A

00:50:58.922 --> 00:51:01.258
FEW ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE

00:51:01.324 --> 00:51:03.827
CONSIDERATION AS YOU --

00:51:03.894 --> 00:51:05.262
A UNDERTAKE YOUR YOUR OVERSIGHT

00:51:05.328 --> 00:51:08.398
ACTIVITIES ARE THE FIRST WHICH

00:51:08.465 --> 00:51:09.566
WAS -- I

00:51:09.633 --> 00:51:11.435
THINK SCENE IN ONE OF THE OTHER --

00:51:11.501 --> 00:51:13.069
CHARTS THE REPRESENTED EARLIER

00:51:13.136 --> 00:51:14.037
BUT NOW IS WORTH HIGHLIGHTING

00:51:14.104 --> 00:51:16.106
THAT THE CARBON INTENSITY OF THE

00:51:16.173 --> 00:51:18.008
FUELS A STATEWIDE HAS REDUCED

00:51:18.074 --> 00:51:19.543
SINCE THE PROGRAM BEGAN.

00:51:19.609 --> 00:51:21.011
SO AVERAGE CARBON INTENSITY HAS

00:51:21.077 --> 00:51:25.649
DECREASED BY MORE THAN 3% FROM

00:51:25.715 --> 00:51:26.249
TWENTY TEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:51:26.316 --> 00:51:26.750
SO THERE HAVE BEEN SOME

00:51:26.817 --> 00:51:27.050
REDUCTIONS.

00:51:27.117 --> 00:51:28.051
LITTLE DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE

00:51:28.118 --> 00:51:30.520
EXACTLY HOW MUCH OF THAT IS DUE

00:51:30.587 --> 00:51:31.922
TO LTFS VERSES SOME OTHER

00:51:31.988 --> 00:51:33.323
PROGRAMS BUT I THINK IT'S FAIR

00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:34.424
TO SAY THAT NET SIGNIFICANT

00:51:34.491 --> 00:51:35.392
PORTION OF IT PROBABLY IS

00:51:35.459 --> 00:51:38.161
RELATED TO LCF US --

00:51:38.228 --> 00:51:40.464
THE SECOND ISSUE IS THAT --

00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:41.965
LTFS.

00:51:42.032 --> 00:51:44.100
LIKELY AS NOT THE MOST EFFECTIVE

00:51:44.167 --> 00:51:45.368
STRATEGY FOR REDUCING GREENHOUSE

00:51:45.435 --> 00:51:47.604
GASES --

00:51:47.671 --> 00:51:49.105
MEAN JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF

00:51:49.172 --> 00:51:50.740
CREDIT PRICES FOR LCF AS

00:51:50.807 --> 00:51:52.676
COMPARED TO ALLOWANCE PRICES IN

00:51:52.742 --> 00:51:54.244
THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM.

00:51:54.311 --> 00:51:55.712
BOTH OF WHICH ARE AT LEAST IN

00:51:55.779 --> 00:51:57.113
THEORY SORT OF MANTRA FLECKED.

00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:58.348
THE COST OF ENCOURAGING THAT

00:51:58.415 --> 00:51:59.716
ADDITIONAL EMISSION REDUCTION

00:51:59.783 --> 00:52:01.084
NEEDED TO MEET THE STANDARD IN

00:52:01.151 --> 00:52:02.619
THE PROGRAM.

00:52:02.686 --> 00:52:04.754
ACCREDIT PRICES AN LCI FASTS ARE

00:52:04.821 --> 00:52:06.790
YOU KNOW ROUGHLY.

00:52:06.857 --> 00:52:08.492
HUNDRED FIFTY I DOLLARS --

00:52:08.558 --> 00:52:09.559
AROUND THAT --

00:52:09.626 --> 00:52:11.561
CAPTURED ALLOWANCE PRICES ARE

00:52:11.628 --> 00:52:12.429
FIFTEEN DOLLARS SO THERE'S SORT

00:52:12.496 --> 00:52:13.597
OF A TEN FOLD EARLY ON THERE'S

00:52:13.663 --> 00:52:14.998
THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE

00:52:15.065 --> 00:52:16.766
BETWEEN THOSE --

00:52:16.833 --> 00:52:18.435
AND JUST AND CONCEPTS --

00:52:18.502 --> 00:52:19.703
I THINK SORT OF ECONOMIST SORT

00:52:19.769 --> 00:52:22.339
OF WHY A DATE.

00:52:22.405 --> 00:52:24.341
ANY OFTEN TEND TO PREFER SORT OF

00:52:24.407 --> 00:52:25.775
ECONOMY WIDE PRICING LIKE CAP

00:52:25.842 --> 00:52:28.345
AND TRADE PROGRAMS IS THAT --

00:52:28.411 --> 00:52:29.946
YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE THE LOW

00:52:30.013 --> 00:52:31.014
CARBON FUELS --

00:52:31.081 --> 00:52:31.581
STANDARD ONLY TARGET CERTAIN

00:52:31.648 --> 00:52:33.850
TYPE.

00:52:33.917 --> 00:52:34.784
I'M GOING BACK TO THIS THIS

00:52:34.851 --> 00:52:35.986
POLICY IS REALLY TARGETED JUST

00:52:36.052 --> 00:52:38.355
AT THE CARBON INTENSITY OF FUELS.

00:52:38.421 --> 00:52:40.056
BUT REALLY SORT OF NO INCENTIVES

00:52:40.123 --> 00:52:41.825
FOR REDUCING EMISSIONS AND OTHER

00:52:41.892 --> 00:52:43.193
SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY OR IN

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:44.628
OTHER WAYS --

00:52:44.694 --> 00:52:45.762
AND SO THERE MIGHT BE SORT OF

00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:47.664
LOW COST OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE

00:52:47.731 --> 00:52:48.532
OUT THERE THAT JUST THIS PROGRAM

00:52:48.598 --> 00:52:48.798
DOESN'T --

00:52:48.865 --> 00:52:51.568
SPIT KLAY --

00:52:51.635 --> 00:52:53.336
ENCOURAGING SO IN ON SOMEBODY

00:52:53.403 --> 00:52:54.838
THAT SORT OF YOU KNOW --

00:52:54.905 --> 00:52:56.406
MIGHT NOT TO CAPTURE A SOME OF

00:52:56.473 --> 00:52:57.407
THE OTHER LOW COST OPPORTUNITIES

00:52:57.474 --> 00:52:58.808
THAT FOR EXAMPLE THE CAP AND

00:52:58.875 --> 00:53:02.078
TRADE PROGRAM MIGHT --

00:53:02.145 --> 00:53:03.580
THERE ARE NOW WITH THAT SAID I

00:53:03.647 --> 00:53:04.414
MEAN THERE ARE SOME OTHER

00:53:04.481 --> 00:53:06.483
CRITERIA THAT'S THE LEGISLATURE

00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:07.350
WILL PROLLY WANT TO CONSIDER

00:53:07.417 --> 00:53:08.785
WHEN ASSESSING THE PROGRAM SO

00:53:08.852 --> 00:53:10.620
SOME OF THE OTHER STATED GOALS

00:53:10.687 --> 00:53:12.188
FOR THE PROGRAM ARE FOR EXAMPLE

00:53:12.255 --> 00:53:14.457
TO DIVERSIFY THE FUEL MIX --

00:53:14.524 --> 00:53:16.326
AND PROMOTE INNOVATION AND FUELS

00:53:16.393 --> 00:53:17.527
ON SORT OF IN SOME CASES MAYBE

00:53:17.594 --> 00:53:19.396
THOSE FIELDS COULD BE --

00:53:19.462 --> 00:53:21.264
TO SORT OF THE INNOVATION AND

00:53:21.331 --> 00:53:23.033
DEVELOPMENT AND THOSE FUELS --

00:53:23.099 --> 00:53:24.167
CAN HELP SORT LOWER COSTS FOR

00:53:24.234 --> 00:53:26.036
OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND PRINT

00:53:26.102 --> 00:53:27.504
PERHAPS I'LL ALLOW THEM.

00:53:27.571 --> 00:53:28.805
TO A USE LOWER CARBON FUELS AND

00:53:28.872 --> 00:53:30.240
REDUCE OVERALL GREENHOUSE GAS

00:53:30.307 --> 00:53:32.042
EMISSIONS GLOBALLY --

00:53:32.108 --> 00:53:32.842
AND REDUCE COAL POLLUTANT SO

00:53:32.909 --> 00:53:34.044
THAT THOSE ARE OTHER FACTORS AND

00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:35.478
SORT OF STATED GOALS FOR THE

00:53:35.545 --> 00:53:36.913
PROGRAM --

00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:38.348
AND THE LEGISLATURE JUST NEED TO

00:53:38.415 --> 00:53:39.783
KIND OF EVALUATE THE EXTENT TO

00:53:39.849 --> 00:53:42.085
WHICH THIS PROGRAM DOES ACHIEVE

00:53:42.152 --> 00:53:42.686
THOSE GOALS AND WHETHER OR NOT

00:53:42.752 --> 00:53:44.721
IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S WORTH

00:53:44.788 --> 00:53:45.989
WHATEVER.

00:53:46.056 --> 00:53:47.390
ADDITIONAL COSTS MIGHT AND YOU

00:53:47.457 --> 00:53:48.124
KNOW REDUCTION AND COST

00:53:48.191 --> 00:53:49.192
EFFECTIVENESS IN ORDER TO

00:53:49.259 --> 00:53:50.594
ACHIEVE THOSE ALTERNATE GOALS

00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:51.294
THAT -- THAT

00:53:51.361 --> 00:53:51.895
MIGHT BE OF INTEREST TO THE TO

00:53:51.962 --> 00:53:55.031
THE LETTERS.

00:53:55.098 --> 00:53:56.866
AND THEN FINALLY A REAL QUICKLY

00:53:56.933 --> 00:53:59.002
ON THE CREDIT CLEARING MARKET --

00:53:59.069 --> 00:54:00.737
AND I THINK ARE AT LEAST KIND

00:54:00.804 --> 00:54:01.805
INITIAL TAKE ON HAVING REVIEWED

00:54:01.871 --> 00:54:03.340
THE CREDIT CLAIM MARKET IS THAT

00:54:03.406 --> 00:54:05.108
YOU KNOW DOESN'T UNLIKE THE CAP

00:54:05.175 --> 00:54:06.576
AND TRADE PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE

00:54:06.643 --> 00:54:09.212
WHICH RECENT LEGISLATION LAST

00:54:09.279 --> 00:54:10.347
YEAR SORT OF REQUIRED A HARD

00:54:10.413 --> 00:54:11.615
PRICE CEILING ON THE ON THE

00:54:11.681 --> 00:54:13.583
CREDITS OR ALLOWANCES THROUGH

00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:14.584
THAT PROGRAM.

00:54:14.651 --> 00:54:16.052
OUT THIS MECHANISM DOESN'T

00:54:16.119 --> 00:54:17.721
REALLY HAVE THAT SAME TYPE OF

00:54:17.787 --> 00:54:19.356
STRUCTURE --

00:54:19.422 --> 00:54:20.090
YEAH THERE'S NO SORT OF

00:54:20.156 --> 00:54:21.891
ADDITIONAL SUPPLY OF CREDITS

00:54:21.958 --> 00:54:23.293
THAT THE OF THAT STATE WILL BE

00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:24.628
ISSUING AN ORDER TO SERVE ENSURE

00:54:24.694 --> 00:54:27.197
PRICES STABLE OUR PARTICULAR.

00:54:27.263 --> 00:54:27.998
LEVEL SO IN THAT WAY IT DOESN'T

00:54:28.064 --> 00:54:29.866
WORK CREATE BE KIND OF HARD CAP

00:54:29.933 --> 00:54:31.234
THAT YOU HAVE SOME OF THE OTHER.

00:54:31.301 --> 00:54:33.570
NOT CLIMATE POLICY MECHANISMS

00:54:33.637 --> 00:54:35.905
THAT WE HAVE A DOES --

00:54:35.972 --> 00:54:37.540
BUT THERE IS I THINK IT IS WORTH

00:54:37.607 --> 00:54:38.975
NOTING THERE IS SOME OTHER

00:54:39.042 --> 00:54:40.677
FLEXIBILITY AND THE PROGRAM

00:54:40.744 --> 00:54:42.345
WHERE -- IF

00:54:42.412 --> 00:54:43.847
AN ENTITY IS UNABLE TO KIND OF

00:54:43.913 --> 00:54:45.515
OBTAIN ENOUGH CREDITS TO COVER

00:54:45.582 --> 00:54:47.017
ITS DEFICITS IN A PARTICULAR

00:54:47.083 --> 00:54:48.218
YEAR.

00:54:48.284 --> 00:54:49.252
THEN THERE'S SORT OF A A A

00:54:49.319 --> 00:54:51.187
WINDOWS SORT OF FIVE YEAR WINDOW

00:54:51.254 --> 00:54:52.489
WHERE YOU THINK THEY CAN KIND OF

00:54:52.555 --> 00:54:54.324
CARRY OVER THAT DEFICIT.

00:54:54.391 --> 00:54:56.192
THINKER SOME INTEREST BUT THEY

00:54:56.259 --> 00:54:56.960
CAN KIND OF THE NOTHING GET

00:54:57.027 --> 00:54:58.328
ENOUGH ALLOWANCES OR CREDITS IN

00:54:58.395 --> 00:54:59.562
A FUTURE YEAR THINKING OUT OF

00:54:59.629 --> 00:55:01.064
USE THOSE TO COMPLY SO THEIR SON.

00:55:01.131 --> 00:55:03.933
AND FLEXIBILITY BUILT INTO IT

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.138
THAT IT'S INTO AND CREDIT PRICES --

00:55:08.204 --> 00:55:09.739
BUT THERE'S NOTHING SORT OF OVER

00:55:09.806 --> 00:55:11.941
THE LONG TERM IF --

00:55:12.008 --> 00:55:13.476
THE LEVEL CREDITS ARE SORT OF

00:55:13.543 --> 00:55:14.944
INSUFFICIENT TO MEET THE DEMAND

00:55:15.011 --> 00:55:16.112
FOR THOSE CREDITS THAT WOULD

00:55:16.179 --> 00:55:17.647
PREVENT PRICES FROM --

00:55:17.714 --> 00:55:19.482
FROM -- FROM

00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:20.517
EXCEEDING THAT TWO HUNDRED

00:55:20.583 --> 00:55:22.152
DOLLAR CAP THAT'S IN THE THE

00:55:22.218 --> 00:55:24.087
CREDIT CLEARANCE MARKET.

00:55:24.154 --> 00:55:26.723
SO -- THAT'S

00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:28.391
MY ATTEMPTED AND RUNNING THROUGH

00:55:28.458 --> 00:55:30.093
THE LC HAVE BEST PROGRAM VERY

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.429
QUICKLY I'M SURE YOU HAVE.

00:55:32.495 --> 00:55:33.063
QUESTIONS FOR ME AND OTHERS ARE

WE'RE LOOKING AT I JUST.

00:55:53.783 --> 00:55:56.986
ALWAYS LOTS OF QUESTIONS.

BUT IN AND APPRECIATE YOU

00:55:58.722 --> 00:55:59.689
STARTED OFF BY SAYING THAT THE

00:55:59.756 --> 00:56:00.590
LA EYES THAT LOOKED --

00:56:00.657 --> 00:56:04.994
AT LC OFFENSIVE DEATH IT YUBA

00:56:05.061 --> 00:56:06.429

BUT I DO HAVE A NUMBER OF

00:56:08.865 --> 00:56:12.035
QUESTIONS AND ONE OF YOU.

00:56:12.102 --> 00:56:13.336
FIRST BEGINNING YOU TALKED ABOUT

00:56:13.403 --> 00:56:14.604
THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN DEFICITS

00:56:14.671 --> 00:56:15.505
EXCEED CREDITS OF THE MARKET

00:56:15.572 --> 00:56:17.774
SYSTEM.

00:56:17.841 --> 00:56:18.708
I WAS JUST WONDERING ITALY THAT

00:56:18.775 --> 00:56:21.878
WAS YOUR SLIDE ON PAGE.

00:56:21.945 --> 00:56:23.279
PAGE FORWARD AND THINK YOU MIGHT

00:56:23.346 --> 00:56:23.880
HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS BUT WE

00:56:23.947 --> 00:56:28.752
SEE IN THE I WAS JUST.

00:56:28.818 --> 00:56:30.186
ONE AND TWENTY SIXTEEN TWENTY

00:56:30.253 --> 00:56:33.957
SEVENTEEN YOU SEE THE AVOID

00:56:34.023 --> 00:56:34.924
EVERY SAID THE DEFICITS THE

00:56:34.991 --> 00:56:36.793
INCREASE IN THE DEFICITS

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:37.093
[inaudible]

00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:39.262
CORRECT.

00:56:39.329 --> 00:56:41.164
SO IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TWENTY

00:56:41.231 --> 00:56:41.831
SEVEN YOU SEE THAT INCREASE BUT

00:56:41.898 --> 00:56:42.799
WAS AT ALL RELATED BECAUSE OF

00:56:42.866 --> 00:56:44.400
THE COURT CASE WHO WAS.

00:56:44.467 --> 00:56:45.335
OVER THE OTHER.

00:56:45.401 --> 00:56:47.804
FACTORS THAT --

00:56:47.871 --> 00:56:49.339
THE WEB I MEAN I BELIEVE THE

00:56:49.405 --> 00:56:52.575
THEY GONNA BIGGEST EXPLANATIONS

00:56:52.642 --> 00:56:54.210
FOR THE INCREASE IN DEFICIT THAT

00:56:54.277 --> 00:56:54.811
REALLY I MEAN YOU KIND OF SEEN

00:56:54.878 --> 00:56:56.679
THE A STANDARD THAT SOME PLACE

00:56:56.746 --> 00:56:58.948
THE SORT OF BENCHMARK A CARBON

00:56:59.015 --> 00:57:00.283
INTENSITY STANDARD.

00:57:00.350 --> 00:57:01.785
GOING DOWN SO THE OTHERS SORT OF

00:57:01.851 --> 00:57:02.919
YOU KNOW THAT THIS STANDARD

00:57:02.986 --> 00:57:03.920
BECOMES MORE STRINGENT OVER TIME

00:57:03.987 --> 00:57:06.456
AND SO THAT MEANS. FOR EXAMPLE

00:57:06.523 --> 00:57:08.158
FOR SORT OF A GIVEN LEVEL OF OF

00:57:08.224 --> 00:57:10.093
GASOLINE SUPPLIED --

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:11.427
YOU'RE GENERATING SORT OF MORE

00:57:11.494 --> 00:57:12.862
DEFICITS BECAUSE IT'S IT'S A

00:57:12.929 --> 00:57:14.697
SORT OF A YOU KNOW GIVEN CARBON

00:57:14.764 --> 00:57:16.065
INTENSITY UPS OR GASOLINE LET'S

00:57:16.132 --> 00:57:16.566
SAY.

00:57:16.633 --> 00:57:17.534
YOU'RE GENERATING JUST MORE

00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:19.202
DEFICITS FOR THE GIVEN LEVEL AS

00:57:19.269 --> 00:57:20.770
THE SORT OF STANDARD RATCHETS

00:57:20.837 --> 00:57:23.706
DOWN AND SO I THINK THAT'S AT

00:57:23.773 --> 00:57:24.741
THE BIG EXPLANATION I MEAN YOU

00:57:24.808 --> 00:57:25.441
KNOW.

00:57:25.508 --> 00:57:26.576
OTHER FACTORS THAT AFFECT JUST

00:57:26.643 --> 00:57:27.811
LEVEL DEFICITS ARE ALSO JUST THE

00:57:27.877 --> 00:57:29.746
OVERALL CONSUMPTION OF DIFFERENT

00:57:29.813 --> 00:57:31.447
FUELS SO IF NO MORE FUELS ARE

00:57:31.514 --> 00:57:31.915
BEING.

00:57:31.981 --> 00:57:33.149
ART MORE HIGHER CARBON FIELD IN

00:57:33.216 --> 00:57:35.418
PARTICULAR BEING --

00:57:35.485 --> 00:57:36.052
CONSUME THEM THAT THAT INCREASES

00:57:36.119 --> 00:57:40.190
THE OF THEIR THE STANDARD

00:57:40.256 --> 00:57:41.124
BECOMING MORE STRINGENT OVER

00:57:41.191 --> 00:57:42.659
TIME AND THAT RESULTS IN ALL

00:57:42.725 --> 00:57:45.128
ELSE EQUAL MORE DEFICITS.

00:57:45.195 --> 00:57:45.762
MONTH AS WE REACH TWENTY TWENTY

00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:47.163
RIGHT.

00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:47.897
GOTTEN ORDER THE REVIEWS THAT

00:57:47.964 --> 00:57:49.132
WERE EXPECTING THAT TO GENERATE

00:57:49.199 --> 00:57:50.433
FROM.

00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:53.803
FROM JUST THE CREDITS --

00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:55.805
SO THERE'S THERE'S NO REAL KIND

00:57:55.872 --> 00:57:59.008
OF STATE REVENUE --

00:57:59.075 --> 00:58:00.910
ASSOCIATE WITH THIS SO THEY CAN

00:58:00.977 --> 00:58:01.945
A MENTION THAT THIS WAS GONNA

00:58:02.011 --> 00:58:03.012
THROUGHOUT ITS ALL SORT OF MARK

00:58:03.079 --> 00:58:03.479
QUEEN.

00:58:03.546 --> 00:58:05.648
BETWEEN VARIOUS PARTIES THAT ARE

00:58:05.715 --> 00:58:07.183
PART OF THE REGULATION.

00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:08.218
I AND I THINK WE JUST WE DID

00:58:08.284 --> 00:58:09.352
SOME KIND OF ROUGH BACK OF THE

00:58:09.419 --> 00:58:10.920
ENVELOPE.

00:58:10.987 --> 00:58:12.622
NUMBERS ON SORT OF YOU KNOW AT

00:58:12.689 --> 00:58:14.624
AT CREDIT PRICES OF HUNDRED

00:58:14.691 --> 00:58:16.192
DOLLARS AND YOU KNOW THERE WERE

00:58:16.259 --> 00:58:18.228
ROUGHLY. TEN MILLION CREDITS

00:58:18.294 --> 00:58:21.731
GENERATED AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:58:21.798 --> 00:58:22.732
SO THAT HUNDRED DOLLARS EACH

00:58:22.799 --> 00:58:23.833
THAT'S ABOUT YOU KNOW A BILLION

00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:24.968
DOLLARS WORTH OF SORT OF VALUE

00:58:25.034 --> 00:58:27.270
AND LCF CREDITS THAT WERE

00:58:27.337 --> 00:58:29.339
GENERATED.

00:58:29.405 --> 00:58:31.007
SO ANY OTHER VALUE THOSE CHANGES

00:58:31.074 --> 00:58:32.642
OVER TIME SO THAT YEAH THERE'S

00:58:32.709 --> 00:58:34.711
NOT THAT ROUGH AMBER BUT ARGUED

00:58:34.777 --> 00:58:35.311
THAT GIVES YOU A TOTAL GENERAL

00:58:35.378 --> 00:58:38.047
SENSE I THINK.

00:58:38.114 --> 00:58:40.016
GOT IT NOW DOES THE LC IF ASKED

00:58:40.083 --> 00:58:41.451
COMPLEMENT EXISTING PROGRAMS AND

00:58:41.517 --> 00:58:44.053
REGULATIONS INTENDED TO REDUCE

00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.455
GHG YOU TALKED ABOUT IT I KNOW

00:58:45.521 --> 00:58:45.955
TOWARDS THE END OF YOUR

00:58:46.022 --> 00:58:47.090
PRESENTATION AND SOME OF THE

00:58:47.156 --> 00:58:48.491
OTHER THINGS.

00:58:48.558 --> 00:58:49.092
I YOU MENTIONED CAP AND TRADE

00:58:49.158 --> 00:58:51.461
BUT KNOW IS IT THIS IS THE BEST

00:58:51.527 --> 00:58:54.898
USE OF TACKLING --

00:58:54.964 --> 00:58:57.500
THOSE REGULATORY GOALS.

00:58:57.567 --> 00:59:01.170
YEAH I MEAN I GUESS --

00:59:01.237 --> 00:59:02.338
IT'S IT'S CUMPLIR HITS

00:59:02.405 --> 00:59:03.373
COMPLICATED I GOT SOME IN THERE

00:59:03.439 --> 00:59:05.408
ARE KIND OF COMPLICATED --

00:59:05.475 --> 00:59:07.043
INTERACTION IN ON THE ONE HAND.

00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:08.444
YOU'VE THEIR OTHER POLICIES THAT

00:59:08.511 --> 00:59:10.246
TARGET OTHER PARTS OF KIND OF

00:59:10.313 --> 00:59:12.348
THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR LIKE

00:59:12.415 --> 00:59:14.450
VEHICLE EFFICIENCY AND VEHICLE

00:59:14.517 --> 00:59:15.718
MILES TRAVELED AND SO THIS KIND

00:59:15.785 --> 00:59:17.020
OF THING YOU KNOW CATCHES THAT

00:59:17.086 --> 00:59:17.787
THIRD.

00:59:17.854 --> 00:59:19.422
LAGGED -- I

00:59:19.489 --> 00:59:21.991
THINK AT A HIGHER LEVEL THOUGH --

00:59:22.058 --> 00:59:24.160
NEAR THE THE KIND OF CAP AND

00:59:24.227 --> 00:59:25.895
TRADE PROGRAM WE SEE AS SORT OF

00:59:25.962 --> 00:59:27.997
THE YOU KNOW IT SHOULD BE SORT

00:59:28.064 --> 00:59:30.133
OF A CENTRAL PIECE OF THE

00:59:30.199 --> 00:59:31.701
STATE'S CLIMATE BALL GOAL --

00:59:31.768 --> 00:59:32.869
KIND OF POLICIES --

00:59:32.936 --> 00:59:34.003
IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE ITS GOALS

00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:35.905
BECAUSE WE DO THINK IT'S LIKELY

00:59:35.972 --> 00:59:37.340
THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE --

00:59:37.407 --> 00:59:38.675
I THINK YOU KNOW SOME OF THE THE

00:59:38.741 --> 00:59:40.043
REASONS WHICH WE HAVE THE

00:59:40.109 --> 00:59:41.177
COMMITTEE WILL WANT TO KIND OF

00:59:41.244 --> 00:59:42.478
ASSASSIN ENGAGED AS A KIND OF

00:59:42.545 --> 00:59:44.247
ASSESSES.

00:59:44.314 --> 00:59:46.249
THE THE LCF ASSN KIND OF THE

00:59:46.316 --> 00:59:47.617
ROLE THAT YOU PLAY AS IN OTHER

00:59:47.684 --> 00:59:48.985
CASES WHERE THE CAP AND TRADE

00:59:49.052 --> 00:59:50.820
PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE DOESN'T

00:59:50.887 --> 00:59:52.322
ENCOURAGE FOR WHATEVER REASON

00:59:52.388 --> 00:59:53.623
DOESN'T KIND OF PUSH ENOUGH

00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:55.491
INNOVATION IN A PARTICULAR AREA

00:59:55.558 --> 00:59:56.793
IN A PARTICULAR.

00:59:56.859 --> 00:59:58.695
A SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY FOR FOR

00:59:58.761 --> 01:00:00.296
ONE REASON OR ANOTHER AND SO IT

01:00:00.363 --> 01:00:02.732
WAS THEIR NEED FOR AN ADDITIONAL

01:00:02.799 --> 01:00:03.633
POLICY THAT KIND OF HELPS.

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.668
PUSH THAT PARTICULAR SECTOR FOR

01:00:05.735 --> 01:00:07.070
WHAT FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER --

01:00:07.136 --> 01:00:08.705
AND AND THOSE TYPES OF THINGS

01:00:08.771 --> 01:00:10.473
HAVE YOU KNOW THAT.

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:11.374
WE THINK THOSE ARE KIND OF THE

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:12.976
QUESTIONS TO BE ASKING AND

01:00:13.042 --> 01:00:13.776
THINKING ABOUT WHAT'S THE VALUE

01:00:13.843 --> 01:00:15.912
OF OF HAVING SOME OF THESE OTHER

01:00:15.979 --> 01:00:17.447
POLICIES ON TOP OF CAP AND TRADE

01:00:17.513 --> 01:00:19.015
I GUESS THAT THE FINAL THING IS.

01:00:19.082 --> 01:00:20.616
NOW COVENTRY DOESN'T COVER ALL

01:00:20.683 --> 01:00:22.785
EMISSIONS AND SO ON THE OTHER

01:00:22.852 --> 01:00:24.187
MISSIONS KIND OUTSIDE OF THE CAP

01:00:24.253 --> 01:00:26.022
WHICH ENDS IN SOME OF THOSE

01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:27.056
EMISSIONS ARE.

01:00:27.123 --> 01:00:28.624
A AND REDUCTIONS IN THOSE

01:00:28.691 --> 01:00:30.760
EMISSIONS ARE BEING INCENTIVIZE

01:00:30.827 --> 01:00:32.495
BY SOME OF THE LTFS OF SOME OF

01:00:32.562 --> 01:00:34.097
THE METHANE EMISSIONS FROM.

01:00:34.163 --> 01:00:35.765
THE AGRICULTURAL AND AREAS FOR

01:00:35.832 --> 01:00:36.799
EXAMPLE YOU KNOW YOU THERE ARE

01:00:36.866 --> 01:00:38.301
SOME SORT OF INCENTIVES IN THIS

01:00:38.368 --> 01:00:39.802
PROGRAM TO DO KIND OF ENCOURAGE.

01:00:39.869 --> 01:00:41.070
EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS IN THAT

01:00:41.137 --> 01:00:42.138
AREA AND SO YOU KNOW WHEN I

01:00:42.205 --> 01:00:43.539
THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW THAT MAYBE

01:00:43.606 --> 01:00:45.508
THERE IS SORT OF A ROLE FOR

01:00:45.575 --> 01:00:47.176
OTHER POLICIES TO KIND OF THEIR

01:00:47.243 --> 01:00:47.744
DEATH FOR HIS ROLE FOR THE

01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:50.046
POLICIES.

01:00:50.113 --> 01:00:50.680
TO TRY TO ENCOURAGE THOSE TYPES

01:00:50.747 --> 01:00:53.016
THE REDUCTIONS GOT SO FROM YOUR

01:00:53.082 --> 01:00:53.950
ANALYSIS THE WAY YOU'VE LOOKED

01:00:54.017 --> 01:00:54.550
AT IT THOUGH IN TALKING ABOUT

01:00:54.617 --> 01:00:55.084
LIKE SAY THE CAP AND TRADE

01:00:55.151 --> 01:00:55.985
PROGRAM.

01:00:56.052 --> 01:00:58.087
MAN IS ELSIE VESTS A DUPLICATIVE

01:00:58.154 --> 01:01:03.559
IS ARE WE I MEAN.

01:01:03.626 --> 01:01:05.595
I THINK THERE THERE ARE

01:01:05.661 --> 01:01:07.030
DEFINITELY --

01:01:07.096 --> 01:01:08.464
SOME REDUCTIONS THAT OCCURRED

01:01:08.531 --> 01:01:11.667
THROUGH THE LCF* PROGRAM

01:01:11.734 --> 01:01:13.469
THAT'S WHERE FOR EXAMPLE IF

01:01:13.536 --> 01:01:14.037
YOU'RE KIND OF YOUNG TRADING

01:01:14.103 --> 01:01:16.572
LASTS -- NO

01:01:16.639 --> 01:01:19.809
GASOLINE CONSUMPTION THEN --

01:01:19.876 --> 01:01:20.843
YET THOSE ARE MISSIONS THAT ARE

01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:22.345
UNDER THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM

01:01:22.412 --> 01:01:23.746
AND AS LONG AS IF THE CAP AND

01:01:23.813 --> 01:01:25.415
TRADE PROGRAM IS STRINGENT OFTEN

01:01:25.481 --> 01:01:27.150
BINDING.

01:01:27.216 --> 01:01:28.785
AND THOSE WOULD HAVE OCCURRED --

01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:30.686
ANYWAY ISN'T IT MIGHT JUST BE

01:01:30.753 --> 01:01:31.621
SORT OF MIX IT IN YOU KNOW --

01:01:31.687 --> 01:01:32.455
SORT OF SHUFFLING EMISSION

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:34.590
REDUCTIONS AROUND --

01:01:34.657 --> 01:01:36.092
THAT SAID AS THEY GONNA MENTION

01:01:36.159 --> 01:01:37.894
I MEAN THAT THERE ARE SOME --

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.762
RATIONALE FOR HAVING SOME OF

01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:41.764
THESE OTHER POLICIES FOR EXAMPLE

01:01:41.831 --> 01:01:42.932
IF YOU KNOW YOU REDUCING

01:01:42.999 --> 01:01:44.033
EMISSIONS FROM OUTSIDE OF THE

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:45.868
CAP WHICH THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT

01:01:45.935 --> 01:01:47.403
WHETHER THIS IS THE THE EXACT

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:48.838
RIGHT PROGRAM TO DO THAT IS IS

01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:50.440
COME ANOTHER QUESTION.

01:01:50.506 --> 01:01:51.040
OR IF YOU'RE TRYING TO SORT OF

01:01:51.107 --> 01:01:53.176
PUSH INNOVATION OUR PARTICULAR

01:01:53.242 --> 01:01:54.644
AREA SO IN THIS CASE AND SORT OF

01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:56.179
LOW CARBON.

01:01:56.245 --> 01:01:58.081
FUELS FOR FOR SOME REASON YOU

01:01:58.147 --> 01:01:58.781
FEEL LIKE SORT OF THEIR YOU KNOW

01:01:58.848 --> 01:02:00.283
THAT THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM

01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:00.883
OR SOME OF THE OTHER POLICIES

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:02.118
ARE GOING TO DO THAT.

01:02:02.185 --> 01:02:03.553
WELL ENOUGH THEN THERE IS SOME

01:02:03.619 --> 01:02:04.587
SOME RUSSIAN OUT THAT'S WHAT YOU

01:02:04.654 --> 01:02:05.955
KNOW THAT'S A COMPLICATED ANSWER

01:02:06.022 --> 01:02:07.290
NINE YOU KNOW I DIDN'T YEAH YEAH

01:02:07.356 --> 01:02:08.391
I DON'T I DON'T HAVE SORT OF A A

01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:09.892
DIRECT BUT I THINK THESE ARE

01:02:09.959 --> 01:02:11.461
JUST SORT OF SOME OF THE FACTORS

01:02:11.527 --> 01:02:11.661
THAT.

01:02:11.727 --> 01:02:13.162
NOW THE COMMITTEE IN THE

01:02:13.229 --> 01:02:15.331
LEGISLATURE WILL I PROBABLY WANT

01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:16.365
A BALANCE OF THAT SORT OF A

01:02:16.432 --> 01:02:18.034
ASSESSES THE PROGRAM.

01:02:18.101 --> 01:02:19.402
YEAH NOTED THAT SOME OF THOSE

01:02:19.469 --> 01:02:20.436
ARE THE MAJOR FACTORS THAT WOULD

01:02:20.503 --> 01:02:21.771
INFLUENCE PRICE FOR THE LC

01:02:21.838 --> 01:02:23.206
EFFECTS CREDITS AND AS WE

01:02:23.272 --> 01:02:24.707
CONTINUE TO LOOK AT IT

01:02:24.774 --> 01:02:25.007
[inaudible]

01:02:25.074 --> 01:02:25.775
RIGHT YEAH [inaudible]

01:02:25.842 --> 01:02:29.779
BECAUSE GOOD DEFENSIVELY

01:02:29.846 --> 01:02:31.481
MARATHON AS JUST GOING TO SAY I

01:02:31.547 --> 01:02:32.515
MEAN THAT THE BIGGEST THING

01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:33.783
WE'RE GETTING ASKED BACK HOME IS

01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:35.551
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS TWICE.

01:02:35.618 --> 01:02:37.153
AND YOU KNOW IN IN SOME OF THE

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:38.387
SLIDES AND SOME OF THE OTHER

01:02:38.454 --> 01:02:39.889
MATERIALS YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE I

01:02:39.956 --> 01:02:42.225
ARE YOU CONFUSED BY ALL SELF ES

01:02:42.291 --> 01:02:43.326
VERSUS KEVIN TRAVERS ALL THESE

01:02:43.392 --> 01:02:44.360
OTHER PROGRAMS.

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:45.528
SO MAKING YOU REALLY JUST KIND

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:48.131
OF BREAK THAT DOWN AND THE THE

01:02:48.197 --> 01:02:50.233
MOST PLAIN LANGUAGE YOU POSSIBLY

01:02:50.299 --> 01:02:52.201
CAN -- YES

01:02:52.268 --> 01:02:53.703
OF FOLKS AT HOME CAN UNDERSTAND

01:02:53.769 --> 01:02:54.904
YOU KNOW WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING

01:02:54.971 --> 01:02:56.139
ON BECAUSE OF AND WITH WITH

01:02:56.205 --> 01:02:57.440
CALIFORNIA WHERE THE HIGHEST

01:02:57.507 --> 01:02:58.908
REGULATED STATE.

01:02:58.975 --> 01:03:00.676
INSERTED TO BREAK IT DOWN AND

01:03:00.743 --> 01:03:01.878
AND FOR US GOING BACK HOME YOU

01:03:01.944 --> 01:03:03.079
KNOW WE'VE GOT TO GO LAW THERE'S

01:03:03.146 --> 01:03:04.313
THIS PROGRAM THAT REGULATES YOU

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:05.748
HERE BUT THERE'S THIS PROGRAM

01:03:05.815 --> 01:03:06.849
THE REGULATION HERE BUT THEY'RE

01:03:06.916 --> 01:03:09.519
BOTH REGULATING ALONG SOME THE

01:03:09.585 --> 01:03:11.287
SAME LINES BUT YET DIFFERENT.

01:03:11.354 --> 01:03:13.222
SO I MEAN JUST KICKING EVERY

01:03:13.289 --> 01:03:14.724
THAT DOWN FOR THE FOLKS AT HOME

01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:16.192
LISTENING YEAH I MEAN AND AND

01:03:16.259 --> 01:03:17.927
THAT I'M PROBABLY NOT THE BEST

01:03:17.994 --> 01:03:19.529
PERSON TO SORT OF ANSWER YOU

01:03:19.595 --> 01:03:21.531
KNOW WHY WE'RE DOING IT TWICE A

01:03:21.597 --> 01:03:22.832
MEANS OF THAT THE OF THE WORD WE

01:03:22.899 --> 01:03:23.699
DIDN'T COME. TO RECREATE THE

01:03:23.766 --> 01:03:24.901
PROGRAM AND I THINK THAT.

01:03:24.967 --> 01:03:28.838
THE IF THE EXPLANATION THAT --

01:03:28.905 --> 01:03:30.907
I SEEM TO HEAR MOST OFTEN IS

01:03:30.973 --> 01:03:34.610
JUST SORT OF YEAH.

01:03:34.677 --> 01:03:37.013
ó LOW CARBON FUELS WILL NEED

01:03:37.079 --> 01:03:38.748
TO BE SORT OF A SIGNIFICANT PART

01:03:38.814 --> 01:03:43.119
OF SORT OF THAT THE STATE'S --

01:03:43.186 --> 01:03:44.253
KIND OF CLIMATE PUBLIC THEY'VE

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:44.854
THEY WILL NEED TO BE SORE THE

01:03:44.921 --> 01:03:45.688
NEXT THE SINGING PART OF THE

01:03:45.755 --> 01:03:47.890
STATE'S ENERGY MIX GOING FORWARD

01:03:47.957 --> 01:03:49.792
AND THERE ARE SORT OF

01:03:49.859 --> 01:03:51.761
TECHNOLOGICAL BARRIERS AND

01:03:51.827 --> 01:03:53.329
CHALLENGES TO KIND OF PROVIDING

01:03:53.396 --> 01:03:54.897
THOSE TYPES OF LOW CARBON FUELS

01:03:54.964 --> 01:03:55.865
AND SO.

01:03:55.932 --> 01:03:56.966
THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME SORT OF

01:03:57.033 --> 01:03:58.467
AN EXTRA PUSH IN THAT AREA

01:03:58.534 --> 01:04:00.269
BEYOND WHAT'S THE INCENTIVE THAT

01:04:00.336 --> 01:04:01.871
ARE BEING PROVIDED AND CAP AND

01:04:01.938 --> 01:04:03.439
TRADE AND THAT THAT THAT'S IS --

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:05.308
THIS IS KIND OF THE POLICY THAT

01:04:05.374 --> 01:04:08.277
THAT DOES THAT SOUND

01:04:08.344 --> 01:04:08.578
[inaudible]

01:04:08.644 --> 01:04:13.115
ALRIGHT.

01:04:13.182 --> 01:04:14.850
SO ON THAT I MEAN --

01:04:14.917 --> 01:04:16.219
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE THAN FOR

01:04:16.285 --> 01:04:18.354
LCF HAS HAS IT GROWN IN STATE

01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:19.555
PRODUCTION OF ALTERNATIVE FUELS

01:04:19.622 --> 01:04:24.794
AS WE AND I MEAN THAT THAT'S NOT.

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:25.928
A PIECE OF DATA I GUESS THAT

01:04:25.995 --> 01:04:29.365
WE'VE LOOKED AT INDEPTH ME THAT

01:04:29.432 --> 01:04:31.300
I I THINK IT DOES PROVIDE

01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:32.902
INCENTIVES FOR YOU KNOW --

01:04:32.969 --> 01:04:34.437
PRODUCERS BOTH IN STATE AND OUT

01:04:34.503 --> 01:04:36.539
OF STATE TO TRY AND FIND WAYS TO

01:04:36.606 --> 01:04:37.840
REDUCE THE CARBON INTENSITY OF

01:04:37.907 --> 01:04:38.874
THEIR FUELS.

01:04:38.941 --> 01:04:40.509
ARM I DON'T KNOW I DON'T HAVE

01:04:40.576 --> 01:04:42.044
SORT OF OFFHAND SORT OF A

01:04:42.111 --> 01:04:43.779
BREAKDOWN OF YOU KNOW HOW MUCH.

01:04:43.846 --> 01:04:45.214
HOW MUCH OF THAT REDUCTION IN

01:04:45.281 --> 01:04:45.848
THAT SORT THE CREDITS THAT HAVE

01:04:45.915 --> 01:04:46.849
BEEN GENERATED COULD HAVE COME

01:04:46.916 --> 01:04:47.817
FROM IN STATE VERSES OUT OF

01:04:47.883 --> 01:04:49.285
STATE NOW?

01:04:49.352 --> 01:04:50.019
IT'S KIND OF CURIOUS SEE IF

01:04:50.086 --> 01:04:51.354
THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO IT IF

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:52.822
THERE'S A A CREDIT MARKET FOR IT

01:04:52.888 --> 01:04:53.456
THEN I WOULD IMAGINE SOME PEOPLE

01:04:53.522 --> 01:04:54.624
WOULD.

01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:55.925
RUSHED TOWARDS.

01:04:55.992 --> 01:04:57.860
TO RUSH TO FILL THAT NEED THAT

01:04:57.927 --> 01:04:58.694
NAY UNDER CERTAIN LIST OF IT

01:04:58.761 --> 01:04:59.762
DOES IT DOES PROVIDE AN

01:04:59.829 --> 01:05:01.330
INCENTIVE FOR YOU KNOW PRODUCING

01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:02.565
LOWER CARBON FUELS TO TO

01:05:02.632 --> 01:05:04.467
PRODUCERS THAT ARE --

01:05:04.533 --> 01:05:05.701
BETTER AND STATE I DON'T KNOW

01:05:05.768 --> 01:05:06.335
AND YOU KNOW AND PRACTICE SORT

01:05:06.402 --> 01:05:07.503
OF HOW MUCH OF THAT.

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:08.504
HAS OCCURRED HOW MUCH OF THE

01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:11.173
REDUCTIONS IN ACCORDANCE YEAH

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.642
WHICH THAT KINDA GOES INTO --

01:05:12.708 --> 01:05:13.743
THE DISCUSSIONS WE'VE BEEN

01:05:13.809 --> 01:05:16.045
HEARING ABOUT FOR A REGIONALLY

01:05:16.112 --> 01:05:17.313
BASED LCF US.

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:19.248
NEPHEW LOOKED AT WHAT THAT WOULD

01:05:19.315 --> 01:05:20.249
ACTUALLY MEAN FOR THE STATE OF

01:05:20.316 --> 01:05:21.183
CALIFORNIA OR HOW THAT WOULD

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:23.219
EVEN BE.

01:05:23.286 --> 01:05:24.020
TACKLED FROM A POLICY

01:05:24.086 --> 01:05:26.489
PERSPECTIVE.

01:05:26.555 --> 01:05:28.624
I AM I HAVE NOT LOOKED AT KIND

01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:31.727
OF THE ANY PROPOSAL TO END OF

01:05:31.794 --> 01:05:34.797
REGIONALIZED THE LCF ES UM.

01:05:34.864 --> 01:05:36.599
I THINK THAT MY SHORT SORT OF

01:05:36.666 --> 01:05:38.134
INITIAL RESPONSES THAT YOU KNOW

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.335
IT COULD BE MATTER QUITE

01:05:39.402 --> 01:05:40.636
COMPLICATED --

01:05:40.703 --> 01:05:43.239
I'M AND I THINK WE WERE SEEN AND

01:05:43.306 --> 01:05:44.740
I THINK YOU KNOW THE ANALOGY TO

01:05:44.807 --> 01:05:46.409
KIND OF THE CAP AND TRADE MARKET

01:05:46.475 --> 01:05:48.110
IS NO TO SOME CHALLENGES WITH.

01:05:48.177 --> 01:05:49.145
KIND OF TRYING DEBT TO LINK

01:05:49.211 --> 01:05:50.646
PROGRAMS WITH OTHER

01:05:50.713 --> 01:05:52.148
JURISDICTIONS AND YA FATE CHANGE

01:05:52.214 --> 01:05:53.449
COURSE YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU DEAL

01:05:53.516 --> 01:05:55.084
WITH THOSE CHANGES HOW HE SORT

01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:56.786
COORDINATE PROGRAMS BETWEEN.

01:05:56.852 --> 01:05:57.987
A DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS

01:05:58.054 --> 01:05:59.355
CREATES JUST.

01:05:59.422 --> 01:06:00.456
A BIT OF A CHALLENGE BUT I MEAN

01:06:00.523 --> 01:06:02.758
THERE THERE COULD BE POTENTIAL

01:06:02.825 --> 01:06:03.759
TO TO THE EXTENT YOU'RE LINKING.

01:06:03.826 --> 01:06:05.695
A KIND OF ENCOURAGING THE THE

01:06:05.761 --> 01:06:07.797
LOWEST CARBON --

01:06:07.863 --> 01:06:08.431
HEARD THE LOWEST COST SORT OF A

01:06:08.497 --> 01:06:11.334
MISSION THEY'RE ON BUT THAT'S

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.202
JUST SORT OF MY CONCEPTUAL FIRST

01:06:13.269 --> 01:06:14.337
TAKE ON THE ISSUE I DON'T I

01:06:14.403 --> 01:06:14.970
DON'T KNOW THAT HAPPENING MORE

01:06:15.037 --> 01:06:15.938
AT THIS POINT.

01:06:16.005 --> 01:06:18.641
GOT IT I APPRECIATE THAT --

01:06:18.708 --> 01:06:20.976
SO BASED OFF OF WHAT YOU HAVE

01:06:21.043 --> 01:06:22.345
ANALYZE YOU KNOW AGAIN EVERY

01:06:22.411 --> 01:06:23.546
SAID.

01:06:23.612 --> 01:06:24.146
DID LOOK AT IT COMPLETELY AND

01:06:24.213 --> 01:06:25.848
DEATH.

01:06:25.915 --> 01:06:27.717
BUT WATER BECAUSE SOME OF THE

01:06:27.783 --> 01:06:28.484
LEADING ANSWERED WITH THE

01:06:28.551 --> 01:06:30.152
PROPOSED CHANGES IN THE CARBON

01:06:30.219 --> 01:06:33.189
INTENSITY PRODUCTION TIMELINE.

01:06:33.255 --> 01:06:36.058
A PROPOSED BY AIR BE --

01:06:36.125 --> 01:06:38.427
I MEAN.

01:06:38.494 --> 01:06:41.030
I ICE I SUSPECT THESE ARE NOT

01:06:41.097 --> 01:06:42.631
NECESSARILY CONCERNS FROM OUR

01:06:42.698 --> 01:06:44.367
OFFICE BUT I THINK YOU KNOW

01:06:44.433 --> 01:06:46.035
THEY'RE JUST THAT THE STANDARD.

01:06:46.102 --> 01:06:47.770
I WOULD GO OUT TO TWENTY THIRTY

01:06:47.837 --> 01:06:49.672
AND WOULD GO DOWN TO YOUR 20%

01:06:49.739 --> 01:06:50.973
REDUCTION STANDARD BY TWENTY

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:51.974
THIRTY AND SO I THINK --

01:06:52.041 --> 01:06:54.910
I SPECTACLE OF WE KNOW ONE OF

01:06:54.977 --> 01:06:57.113
THE THE LEADING CONCERNS WOULD

01:06:57.179 --> 01:06:57.980
BE JUST KNOW IT'S THERE WILL

01:06:58.047 --> 01:06:59.482
THERE BE ENOUGH.

01:06:59.548 --> 01:07:01.050
AND OF LOWER COST --

01:07:01.117 --> 01:07:03.018
FUELS AVAILBLE IN ORDER TO MEET

01:07:03.085 --> 01:07:03.986
THAT STANDARD YARDS THAT WHAT AT

01:07:04.053 --> 01:07:05.254
WHAT ARE THE THE COST GOING TO

01:07:05.321 --> 01:07:06.989
BE IN ORDER TO MEET THE THE LONG

01:07:07.056 --> 01:07:08.891
TERM STANDARD WILL BE SORT OF

01:07:08.958 --> 01:07:09.158
ENOUGH --

01:07:09.225 --> 01:07:10.926
LOW COST FUELS AN EMISSION

01:07:10.993 --> 01:07:12.461
REDUCTION OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET

01:07:12.528 --> 01:07:13.729
THAT STANDARD --

01:07:13.796 --> 01:07:14.964
YOU IN THE NEAR TERM THAT THE

01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:17.099
STANDARD IS A BIT LESS STRINGENT

01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:17.633
AND SO SORT OF THE OF THE

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:19.001
OUTSIDE OF THE NOT THE OPPOSITE

01:07:19.068 --> 01:07:20.636
EFFECT OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS

01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:21.837
BUT OVER THE LONG TERM I THINK

01:07:21.904 --> 01:07:23.038
YOU KNOW IT'S JUST IT'S THAT

01:07:23.105 --> 01:07:23.973
CONSTRUCTING THIS RIGHT BALANCE

01:07:24.039 --> 01:07:25.274
BETWEEN.

01:07:25.341 --> 01:07:26.575
THE COSTS AND THE EMISSION

01:07:26.642 --> 01:07:27.143
REDUCTIONS OF THAT THE STATE

01:07:27.209 --> 01:07:29.512
WANTS TO ACHIEVE.

01:07:29.578 --> 01:07:31.180
MAYBE I'LL ASK ONE OF OUR LATER

01:07:31.247 --> 01:07:33.115
PANEL THAT SAME QUESTION.

01:07:33.182 --> 01:07:35.251
WITH RATE WITH THAT --

01:07:35.317 --> 01:07:37.086
IT IT BRINGS ME BACK --

01:07:37.153 --> 01:07:38.721
TO TRANSPORTATION HEARING WE HAD

01:07:38.788 --> 01:07:40.389
WITH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:07:40.456 --> 01:07:41.757
AUTHORITY IN THERE WANTING.

01:07:41.824 --> 01:07:47.396
TO THEY EXTEND THE DATES FROM.

01:07:47.463 --> 01:07:47.997
TWENTY THIRTY TWENTY FIFTY THE

01:07:48.063 --> 01:07:49.165
STAINING THAT TIMELINE I MEAN

01:07:49.231 --> 01:07:50.032
WE'VE GOT THE PROGRAM WE'VE GOT

01:07:50.099 --> 01:07:52.234
EVERYTHING SET UP IN IN IN MARCH

01:07:52.301 --> 01:07:54.003
THAN EVERYBODY IN INDUSTRIES RT.

01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:55.404
YOU KNOW PLANNING EVERYTHING OUT

01:07:55.471 --> 01:07:56.939
SO I MEAN.

01:07:57.006 --> 01:08:00.443
BUT WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON IT

01:08:00.509 --> 01:08:01.377
DOES EXTEND IN THAT PROGRAM JAM

01:08:01.444 --> 01:08:02.378
BECAUSE THEY COULD COMPLETELY

01:08:02.445 --> 01:08:05.181
CHANGE ALL THE TARGETS --

01:08:05.247 --> 01:08:07.183
AND I APOLOGIZE JUST IT JUST TO

01:08:07.249 --> 01:08:08.684
CLARIFY MISS HER ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:10.152
SO WE TALKING ABOUT THAT CAP AND

01:08:10.219 --> 01:08:12.688
TRADE PROGRAM OR THE LCF US CAP

01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:13.055
AND TRADE YEAH.

01:08:13.122 --> 01:08:16.192
OKAY -- YEAH

01:08:16.258 --> 01:08:17.660
I MEAN YEAH RIGHT NOW THE

01:08:17.726 --> 01:08:19.361
LEGISLATURE HAS SET ITS

01:08:19.428 --> 01:08:21.630
GREENHOUSE GAS TARGETS OUT TO

01:08:21.697 --> 01:08:22.264
TWENTY THIRTY AND THAT'S KIND OF

01:08:22.331 --> 01:08:24.500
AUTHORIZED A PROGRAM THROUGH

01:08:24.567 --> 01:08:25.100
TWENTY THIRTY I MEAN I THINK.

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:27.736
YANICK EXTENSION BEYOND THAT

01:08:27.803 --> 01:08:29.405
REQUIRE SOME LEGISLATIVE

01:08:29.472 --> 01:08:30.306
ASSESSMENT OF CUT WHERE IT WOULD

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:32.708
LIKE TO SET ITS TARGETS AND IF

01:08:32.775 --> 01:08:34.477
IT DOES YOU KNOW IF IT DOES HAVE

01:08:34.543 --> 01:08:35.878
SORT OF AMBITIONS.

01:08:35.945 --> 01:08:37.613
FOR MORE AGGRESSIVE LONGER TERM

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.181
GREENHOUSE GAS TARGETS THAT WE

01:08:39.248 --> 01:08:41.116
THINK YOU KNOW HAVING A CAP AND

01:08:41.183 --> 01:08:41.717
TRADE PROGRAM TO HELP ACHIEVE

01:08:41.784 --> 01:08:42.952
THAT MAKES.

01:08:43.018 --> 01:08:43.986
A LOT OF SENSE BUT THAT'S A A

01:08:44.053 --> 01:08:45.621
BIG SORT OF POLICY DISCUSSION

01:08:45.688 --> 01:08:46.722
THAT THE LEGISLATURE.

01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:49.091
I SHOULD HAVE AND I THINK THERE

01:08:49.158 --> 01:08:50.659
IS GOOD QUESTIONS ABOUT WHEN.

01:08:50.726 --> 01:08:51.994
OUT OF THAT ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY

01:08:52.061 --> 01:08:53.028
SHOULD BE GIVEN YOU KNOW SHOULD

01:08:53.095 --> 01:08:54.530
SHOULD BE GIVEN EARLIER WHICH

01:08:54.597 --> 01:08:55.865
PROVIDE SOME MORE MARKET

01:08:55.931 --> 01:08:57.199
CERTAINTY YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT

01:08:57.266 --> 01:08:58.167
YOUR SORT OF PROVIDING LONGER

01:08:58.234 --> 01:08:59.969
TERM TARGET SOME LONGER TERM

01:09:00.035 --> 01:09:01.403
AUTHORITY THAT DOES PROVIDE.

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:02.872
SOME BENEFIT FOR MARKET

01:09:02.938 --> 01:09:06.141
CERTAINTY BUT NOBODY YET THE

01:09:06.208 --> 01:09:10.379
LEGISLATURE ALSO OR THAT ONLY

01:09:10.446 --> 01:09:10.946
THAT AND THAT WOULD USE THE

01:09:11.013 --> 01:09:12.248
GOALS OF THOSE.

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:13.148
YOU'VE GOT BOND GOING ONE WAY

01:09:13.215 --> 01:09:15.351
AND ONE GOING THE OTHER WAY.

01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:17.119
I MEAN IT CHANGES THINGS A LOT.

01:09:17.186 --> 01:09:19.555
YEAH I MEAN IT WILL YOU KNOW.

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:20.422
IT MAKES SENSE TO MAKE THOSE

01:09:20.489 --> 01:09:22.157
TYPES OF DECISIONS AND SORT OF

01:09:22.224 --> 01:09:24.260
THE CONTEXT OF IT WHAT WHAT IS

01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:25.494
THIS SORT OF SWEET OF POLICIES

01:09:25.561 --> 01:09:26.962
DO WE DO WE THINK ARE GOING TO

01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:28.030
BE USED IN OUR SORT OF

01:09:28.097 --> 01:09:29.498
REASONABLE AND COST EFFECTIVE

01:09:29.565 --> 01:09:30.399
AND ACHIEVE ALL THE DIFFERENT

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:30.866
GOALS THAT.

01:09:30.933 --> 01:09:32.034
THAT WE HAVE IN PARTICULAR THE

01:09:32.101 --> 01:09:34.069
GREENHOUSE GAS GOALS AND AND HOW

01:09:34.136 --> 01:09:36.238
THEY SORT OF YEAH AROUND IT AND

01:09:36.305 --> 01:09:37.339
I KNOW.

01:09:37.406 --> 01:09:38.374
THE BURKE KIND OF PUT YOU ON THE

01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:39.708
SPOT WITH THAT BUT NOW I MEAN I

01:09:39.775 --> 01:09:40.910
THINK THESE ARE ALL KIND OF GOOD

01:09:40.976 --> 01:09:42.111
QUESTION YOU KNOW HOW KIND OF

01:09:42.177 --> 01:09:44.280
HOW FAR OUT TO SET YOUR GOALS

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:45.614
WHICH POLICIES.

01:09:45.681 --> 01:09:46.248
ARE DO YOU THINK ARTS ARE THE

01:09:46.315 --> 01:09:47.049
MOST EFFECTIVE AND COST

01:09:47.116 --> 01:09:48.450
EFFECTIVE IN ACHIEVING THOSE

01:09:48.517 --> 01:09:49.385
GOALS.

01:09:49.451 --> 01:09:50.653
ARE YOU HOW ARE THEY ALL SORT OF

01:09:50.719 --> 01:09:52.187
IN IRAQ CONFLICT TOGETHER ALL

01:09:52.254 --> 01:09:53.289
SORT OF VERY GOOD QUESTIONS THAT

01:09:53.355 --> 01:09:54.023
YOU KNOW --

01:09:54.089 --> 01:09:55.824
YET DESERVE A LOT OF LEGISLATIVE

01:09:55.891 --> 01:09:56.425
THOUGHT IN CONSUMER GUIDE AND

01:09:56.492 --> 01:09:56.959
THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:58.360
CHALLENGES WE ALWAYS HAVE

01:09:58.427 --> 01:10:00.396
MULTIPLE PROGRAMS INTO FOR

POSSIBLE IN ELECTRICITY NATURAL

01:14:39.208 --> 01:14:41.143
GAS AND TRANSPORTATION FEELS SO

01:14:41.210 --> 01:14:41.743
ALL THREE OF THOSE ARE REALLY

01:14:41.810 --> 01:14:44.479
IMPORTANT --

COMPREHENSIVE ENERGY PLAN I

01:14:46.648 --> 01:14:48.217
THINK WE'RE MAKING SOME STRIDES

01:14:48.283 --> 01:14:49.551
BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET AND THIS

01:14:49.618 --> 01:14:50.886
KIND OF CONVERSATION IS REALLY

01:14:50.953 --> 01:14:52.321
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE LINKAGES

BETWEEN ALL OF THOSE.

01:14:53.789 --> 01:14:55.457

IMPORTANT SO.

01:14:58.627 --> 01:15:00.495
I THINK FOCUSING A LITTLE BIT ON

01:15:00.562 --> 01:15:01.864
A COMPREHENSIVE ENERGY PLAN FOR

01:15:01.930 --> 01:15:02.865
THE STATE GOING FORWARD WILL BE

01:15:02.931 --> 01:15:04.066
ANOTHER REALLY GOOD THING FOR US

01:15:04.132 --> 01:15:06.635
TO DO.

01:15:06.702 --> 01:15:08.203
I AM ETERNALLY BUT NOW TO THE

01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:09.171
HEAVIEST LEGAL OKKERVIL STANDARD

01:15:09.238 --> 01:15:10.772
THE SUBJECT OF THIS.

01:15:10.839 --> 01:15:13.508
AND LAST YEAR YOU ALL KNOW S. B.

01:15:13.575 --> 01:15:14.109
THREE NINETY EIGHT EXTENT CAP

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:15.110
AND TRADE WITH SOME PRETTY

01:15:15.177 --> 01:15:16.945
AGGRESSIVE GOALS.

01:15:17.012 --> 01:15:18.146
BUT THEY HAD A VERY KEEN FOCUS

01:15:18.213 --> 01:15:19.548
YOU ALL HAD A KEEN FOCUS AND WE

01:15:19.615 --> 01:15:21.149
CERTAINLY SUPPORT THAT EXTENSION

01:15:21.216 --> 01:15:22.951
ON COST CONTAINMENT.

01:15:23.018 --> 01:15:24.653
AND I BRING THAT UP BECAUSE

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.455
WE'VE DONE ALL THE EASY THINGS

01:15:26.521 --> 01:15:27.789
EVERYTHING ELSE WE DO NOW IS

01:15:27.856 --> 01:15:29.358
REALLY EXPENSIVE IN WHATEVER

01:15:29.424 --> 01:15:30.792
PROGRAM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND

01:15:30.859 --> 01:15:32.427
SPECIFICALLY IN THIS.

01:15:32.494 --> 01:15:33.228
ONE AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE

01:15:33.295 --> 01:15:34.930
THAT THE BUSINESSES CAN STILL

01:15:34.997 --> 01:15:36.798
OPERATE AND THE CONSUMERS.

01:15:36.865 --> 01:15:37.399
WHO ARE --

01:15:37.466 --> 01:15:38.667
THE YOU KNOW REALLY GETTING

01:15:38.734 --> 01:15:40.969
IMPACTED FROM ALL THESE POLICIES

01:15:41.036 --> 01:15:42.304
ON CAN SUPPORT THIS GOING

01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:43.872
FORWARD IF WE REALLY WANT TO

01:15:43.939 --> 01:15:45.841
HAVE A SUSTAINABLE PROGRAM.

01:15:45.908 --> 01:15:47.276
SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING I WANT TO

01:15:47.342 --> 01:15:47.843
TAKE AWAY FROM THIS BECAUSE

01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:50.012
DISCUSSION ITS TO REALLY KEEP A

01:15:50.078 --> 01:15:52.481
KEEN EYE ON COST CONTAINMENT

01:15:52.547 --> 01:15:55.050
LIKE YOU DID IN CAP AND TRADE.

01:15:55.117 --> 01:15:56.184
BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S IT'S

01:15:56.251 --> 01:15:58.420
INSUFFICIENT IN THIS PROGRAM TO

01:15:58.487 --> 01:15:58.954
ACTUALLY SUSTAIN IT GOING

01:15:59.021 --> 01:16:00.422
FORWARD.

01:16:00.489 --> 01:16:02.724
WE REMAIN PRETTY CONCERNED ABOUT --

01:16:02.791 --> 01:16:04.893
ABOUT THE VIABILITY OF THE FUEL

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:06.194
SUPPLIES THAT AVAILABLE TO ALL

01:16:06.261 --> 01:16:07.763
CONSUMERS AND WE SAY THAT IT'S

01:16:07.829 --> 01:16:09.164
EVERY REGION.

01:16:09.231 --> 01:16:10.899
AND IT'S EVERY SOCIAL ECONOMIC

01:16:10.966 --> 01:16:13.101
STATUS THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

01:16:13.168 --> 01:16:13.602
ALL OF THAT IS IS REALLY

01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:14.870
IMPORTANT.

01:16:14.937 --> 01:16:16.071
YOU ON ALL THIS IS ONE OF THREE

01:16:16.138 --> 01:16:18.040
OF THE POLICIES IN THE STATE OF

01:16:18.106 --> 01:16:20.309
CALIFORNIA THAT DEALS IN IN --

01:16:20.375 --> 01:16:21.944
CLIMATE CHANGE EMISSIONS AS

01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:23.578
REFINERS WERE CERTAINLY LARGE

01:16:23.645 --> 01:16:25.213
STATIONARY SOURCES.

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:27.215
SORE SUBJECT CAP AND TRADE --

01:16:27.282 --> 01:16:28.784
WERE SUBJECT TO TRANSPORTATION

01:16:28.850 --> 01:16:29.985
FUELS UNDER CAP AND TRADE

01:16:30.052 --> 01:16:31.019
WHETHER WE MAKE IT HERE WE

01:16:31.086 --> 01:16:34.056
IMPORT AND AND SO NOW YOU HAVE

01:16:34.122 --> 01:16:35.724
ON TOP THAT OF COURSE THE LOW

01:16:35.791 --> 01:16:37.092
CARBON FUEL STANDARD.

01:16:37.159 --> 01:16:38.393
I PROGRAM AT THINK THEY'LL LEO

01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:40.562
DID A GREAT JOB IN TRYING.

01:16:40.629 --> 01:16:42.531
TO SIMPLIFY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE

01:16:42.597 --> 01:16:44.333
WHICH IS A REALLY COMPLEX

01:16:44.399 --> 01:16:46.501
PROGRAM MOST PEOPLE DON'T EVEN

01:16:46.568 --> 01:16:48.937
KNOW WHAT LCS F. S. MEANS AND SO

01:16:49.004 --> 01:16:50.505
I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THAT

01:16:50.572 --> 01:16:52.674
PREVIOUS CONVERSATION --

01:16:52.741 --> 01:16:54.209
BUT THIS IS A LIFE CYCLE

01:16:54.276 --> 01:16:55.944
EMISSIONS PROGRAM RATED INCLUDES

01:16:56.011 --> 01:16:57.579
ELECTRICITY IN THE REFINING

01:16:57.646 --> 01:16:59.881
PROCESS IT IT INCLUDES --

01:16:59.948 --> 01:17:01.383
IRRIGATION FROM BIOFUELS

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:03.685
INCLUDES FERTILZERS --

01:17:03.752 --> 01:17:05.287
AND SO IT'S NOT A TAILPIPE

01:17:05.354 --> 01:17:06.989
EMISSION PROGRAM RIGHT WE'VE

01:17:07.055 --> 01:17:08.423
DONE A LOT THERE WITH THEIR BE

01:17:08.490 --> 01:17:09.992
WE'VE HAD WHAT THREE QUICKLY TO

01:17:10.058 --> 01:17:11.727
BRING GASOLINE PROGRAMS.

01:17:11.793 --> 01:17:13.628
PATROLS OVER DIESEL.

01:17:13.695 --> 01:17:14.896
AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:17:14.963 --> 01:17:16.231
REQUIRES US TO MAKE THE CLEANEST

01:17:16.298 --> 01:17:17.933
BURNING GASOLINE AND DIESEL ON

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.534
THE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH SO.

01:17:19.601 --> 01:17:21.737
IT IS REALLY FOCUSED ON THIS ON

01:17:21.803 --> 01:17:23.872
THE CARBON INTENSITY AND IT WAS

01:17:23.939 --> 01:17:25.007
A DISCRETE EARLY ACTION OF YOU

01:17:25.073 --> 01:17:28.110
KNOWS ADOPTION TOOK TWO THOUSAND

01:17:28.176 --> 01:17:28.710
NINE BUT IT'S BEEN AFFECT FOR

01:17:28.777 --> 01:17:29.244
TEN YEARS.

01:17:29.311 --> 01:17:30.779
RIGHT THE COMPLIANCE CURVE AS WE

01:17:30.846 --> 01:17:32.447
HEARD WAS BACK END LOADED THAT

01:17:32.514 --> 01:17:34.016
MEANS THAT PERCENTAGE IS PUSHED

01:17:34.082 --> 01:17:35.984
OUT IN THE OUT YEARS AND THAT'S

01:17:36.051 --> 01:17:37.319
FOR VERY GOOD REASON IT'S

01:17:37.386 --> 01:17:38.787
BECAUSE THEY'RE LETTING.

01:17:38.854 --> 01:17:39.554
LOSI AYE FUELS AND TECHNOLOGY

01:17:39.621 --> 01:17:42.457
ADVANCE PROGRAM.

01:17:42.524 --> 01:17:45.193
BUT WORD ABOUT THREE POINT 5%.

01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:46.061
TODAY RIGHT THAT'S THE

01:17:46.128 --> 01:17:47.562
REQUIREMENT AND LIVE A LONG WAY

01:17:47.629 --> 01:17:48.697
TO GO TO EVEN GET TO THE

01:17:48.764 --> 01:17:50.632
ORIGINAL 10% BUT TWENTY TWENTY

01:17:50.699 --> 01:17:52.134
AND NOW OF COURSE THE RB IS

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:54.202
LOOKING AT EXTENDING THAT 218%

01:17:54.269 --> 01:17:56.838
OUT -- TO

01:17:56.905 --> 01:17:57.439
TWENTY THIRTY YOU KNOW FOR THE

01:17:57.506 --> 01:17:59.641
MOST PART IN THE EARLY STAGES OF

01:17:59.708 --> 01:18:01.676
THIS WE MEET THAT BY BLENDING

01:18:01.743 --> 01:18:02.310
LOWER SEE AYE ETHANOL BIODIESEL

01:18:02.377 --> 01:18:03.845
AND RENEWABLE DIESEL.

01:18:03.912 --> 01:18:04.980
BUT THAT'S AT THIS LOW LEVEL

01:18:05.047 --> 01:18:06.248
THREE POINT 5% [inaudible]

01:18:06.314 --> 01:18:08.116
SO.

01:18:08.183 --> 01:18:09.317
I WOULD SAY THAT YOU FOR BE SAID

01:18:09.384 --> 01:18:12.254
BEFORE IN THE IN LIGHT OF ALL OF

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:13.288
THESE PROGRAMS WE ALL KNOW YOUR

01:18:13.355 --> 01:18:14.423
CONSTITUENTS THE PEOPLE THE

01:18:14.489 --> 01:18:15.924
COMMUNITIES WE SERVE WAKE UP

01:18:15.991 --> 01:18:16.625
TOMORROW.

01:18:16.691 --> 01:18:18.326
CAN EXPECT THREE THINGS FROM ALL

01:18:18.393 --> 01:18:19.194
OF US.

01:18:19.261 --> 01:18:20.228
YOU KNOW THEY EXPECT TO TURN THE

01:18:20.295 --> 01:18:22.130
LIGHTS ON HIDDEN COOLER HOMES

01:18:22.197 --> 01:18:22.597
AND DRIVE FOR ME TO BE

01:18:22.664 --> 01:18:23.432
AFFORDABLE.

01:18:23.498 --> 01:18:25.067
AND SO AS WE LOOK AT THIS IN THE

01:18:25.133 --> 01:18:26.768
COMPREHENSIVE SENSE OF ALL THESE

01:18:26.835 --> 01:18:27.035
PROGRAMS.

01:18:27.102 --> 01:18:28.070
YET.

01:18:28.136 --> 01:18:29.938
IT'S ITS NOT HOW WE'RE GOING TO

01:18:30.005 --> 01:18:31.873
BE IN THIS CONGRESS IS THAT IF

01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:32.507
WE'RE GONNA BE THE COMPETITIONS

01:18:32.574 --> 01:18:33.041
REALLY HOWARD AND IN THAT

01:18:33.108 --> 01:18:34.576
CONVERSATION.

01:18:34.643 --> 01:18:37.179
I'M SO PLEASED TO TWENTY

01:18:37.245 --> 01:18:37.946
THIRTEEN TARGETS A PRETTY

01:18:38.013 --> 01:18:39.714
DAUNTING RIGHT THE GO 18% OUT TO

01:18:39.781 --> 01:18:40.782
THE FUTURE.

01:18:40.849 --> 01:18:42.784
AND I DON'T WANNA BE A BROKEN

01:18:42.851 --> 01:18:43.852
RECORD BUT AGAIN COST

01:18:43.919 --> 01:18:45.554
CONTAINMENT IF YOU TAKE ANYTHING

01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:46.922
AWAY FROM THIS PROGRAM AT THIS A

01:18:46.988 --> 01:18:48.723
DISCUSSION.

01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:49.825
PLEASE FOCUSED ON COST

01:18:49.891 --> 01:18:51.026
CONTAINMENT FOR THIS PROGRAM

01:18:51.093 --> 01:18:52.060
LIKE YOU'VE DONE AND LOW CARBON

01:18:52.127 --> 01:18:54.129
FUEL STANDARD.

01:18:54.196 --> 01:18:55.263
RIGHT NOW I THINK YOU HEARD THE

01:18:55.330 --> 01:18:57.532
ILIO SAY THAT CREDIT PRICE FOR

01:18:57.599 --> 01:18:59.401
LOOK COVERAGE FEEL SAD ABOUT A

01:18:59.468 --> 01:19:00.035
HUNDRED FORTY NINE HUNDRED FIFTY

01:19:00.102 --> 01:19:00.702
DOLLARS --

01:19:00.769 --> 01:19:02.404
PER METRIC TON.

01:19:02.471 --> 01:19:04.106
AS COMPARED CAP AND TRADE

01:19:04.172 --> 01:19:06.108
FIFTEEN DOLLARS PER METRIC TON.

01:19:06.174 --> 01:19:07.442
SO YOU'RE BEGINNING TO SEE THE

01:19:07.509 --> 01:19:09.811
COST OF THIS PROGRAM IS FAIRLY

01:19:09.878 --> 01:19:13.048
EXTENSIVE THAT'S A 90% INCREASE.

01:19:13.115 --> 01:19:14.449
IN AVERAGE CREDIT PRICE IN JUST

01:19:14.516 --> 01:19:16.952
A YEAR AGO.

01:19:17.018 --> 01:19:19.221
SO THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING TO DO

01:19:19.287 --> 01:19:20.322
REAL YOU TAKE.

01:19:20.388 --> 01:19:22.157
TAKE A WE'RE TAKING NOTE OF IT --

01:19:22.224 --> 01:19:24.126
AND I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE

01:19:24.192 --> 01:19:26.361
BIT OF CONCERN OVER THE PAST GAS

01:19:26.428 --> 01:19:29.297
TAX OF TWELVE CENTS A GALLON FOR

01:19:29.364 --> 01:19:30.966
GASOLINE TWENTY CENTS FOR DIESEL.

01:19:31.032 --> 01:19:32.167
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT IN

01:19:32.234 --> 01:19:33.401
ADDITION TO LOW CARBON FEEL

01:19:33.468 --> 01:19:34.703
STAND AND WE I JUST LOOK AT THE

01:19:34.769 --> 01:19:36.304
SUBMIT THIS MORNING ON OPUS AND

01:19:36.371 --> 01:19:38.206
CHECK WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION.

01:19:38.273 --> 01:19:39.541
FOR LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:41.376
GASOLINE IS ANOTHER TWELVE POINT

01:19:41.443 --> 01:19:42.844
THREE CENTS A GALLON DIESEL

01:19:42.911 --> 01:19:45.380
EIGHT POINT FOUR CENTS A GALLON.

01:19:45.447 --> 01:19:47.082
OKAY THAT'S ON TOP OF A GAS TAX

01:19:47.149 --> 01:19:49.451
NOW CAP AND TRADE.

01:19:49.518 --> 01:19:50.986
ANOTHER ELEVEN NINE CENTS PER

01:19:51.052 --> 01:19:53.155
GALLON FOR GASOLINE AND FOURTEEN

01:19:53.221 --> 01:19:55.157
CENTS PER POUND FOR DIESEL.

01:19:55.223 --> 01:19:55.991
SO YOU START STACKING UP THESE

01:19:56.057 --> 01:19:58.260
PROGRAMS.

01:19:58.326 --> 01:19:59.161
THAT'S WHY I SAY FOR

01:19:59.227 --> 01:20:00.795
SUSTAINABILITY.

01:20:00.862 --> 01:20:01.596
THE BUSINESSES HAVE TO BE ABLE

01:20:01.663 --> 01:20:03.331
TO OPERATE.

01:20:03.398 --> 01:20:05.867
WHO USE ALL OF THE FUELS AND

01:20:05.934 --> 01:20:07.502
THAT CONSUMERS HAVE TO BE ABLE

01:20:07.569 --> 01:20:09.037
TO SUPPORT A PROGRAM?

01:20:09.104 --> 01:20:10.372
BECAUSE IT'S COST EFFECTIVE AND

01:20:10.438 --> 01:20:11.873
SUSTAINABLE USE START STACKING

01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:13.642
UP THOSE COSTS IT BECOMES PRETTY

01:20:13.708 --> 01:20:15.544
CONCERNING FOR NOT ONLY

01:20:15.610 --> 01:20:17.579
BUSINESSES BUT FOR CONSUMERS SO

01:20:17.646 --> 01:20:18.380
AGAIN.

01:20:18.446 --> 01:20:18.847
COST CONTAINMENT COST

01:20:18.914 --> 01:20:20.415
CONTAINMENT.

01:20:20.482 --> 01:20:21.950
WHEN WE LOOK AT STAFF --

01:20:22.017 --> 01:20:23.685
AIR BE STAFF ASSESSMENT FOR THE

01:20:23.752 --> 01:20:26.188
PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT ARE ARE

01:20:26.254 --> 01:20:26.888
BEFORE US --

01:20:26.955 --> 01:20:28.790
THIS YEAR THE INCREASED COST OF

01:20:28.857 --> 01:20:31.826
COMPLIANCE BETWEEN TWENTY

01:20:31.893 --> 01:20:33.361
NINETEEN AND TWENTY THIRTY IS IN

01:20:33.428 --> 01:20:35.630
EXCESS OF EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS.

01:20:35.697 --> 01:20:37.632
THAT'S THE COST OF COMPLIANCE IN

01:20:37.699 --> 01:20:40.202
THE OUT YEARS OF THE PROGRAM.

01:20:40.268 --> 01:20:41.803
THE SAME STAFF ASSESSMENT.

01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:43.071
AND THAT SHOULD CONCERN US

01:20:43.138 --> 01:20:45.207
EQUALLY AS MUCH SHOWS THAT TWO

01:20:45.273 --> 01:20:45.840
THIRDS OF THAT COST OF

01:20:45.907 --> 01:20:47.309
COMPLIANCE.

01:20:47.375 --> 01:20:48.810
FLOWS OUT OF THE STATE

01:20:48.877 --> 01:20:49.744
BUSINESSES OUT OF STATE

01:20:49.811 --> 01:20:51.746
BUSINESSES.

01:20:51.813 --> 01:20:53.114
SO SOME IS BENEFITING FROM IT

01:20:53.181 --> 01:20:53.915
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT NOT

01:20:53.982 --> 01:20:55.684
NECESSARILY --

01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:58.286
PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA

01:20:58.353 --> 01:20:58.587
[inaudible]

01:20:58.653 --> 01:21:00.789
SO -- IT

01:21:00.855 --> 01:21:03.058
INCREASES COSTS THE CONSUMER.

01:21:03.124 --> 01:21:04.693
GENERATES BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:21:04.759 --> 01:21:05.760
BUT EXPORTS THE BULK OF THAT.

01:21:05.827 --> 01:21:07.963
OUT OF THE STATE.

01:21:08.029 --> 01:21:09.531
SO I LOOK AT ALL OF THEM I KNOW

01:21:09.598 --> 01:21:10.432
ONE THING THERE'S DEFINITELY

01:21:10.498 --> 01:21:10.999
ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THIS

01:21:11.066 --> 01:21:11.600
PROGRAM [inaudible]

01:21:11.666 --> 01:21:13.835
OKAY.

01:21:13.902 --> 01:21:17.672
I'M NOW IT CERTAINLY CAN BE YOU

01:21:17.739 --> 01:21:18.240
KNOW THINGS CAN BE DONE TO

01:21:18.306 --> 01:21:19.608
CORRECT IT --

01:21:19.674 --> 01:21:22.444
WE ARE VERY MUCH INVOLVED IN TWO

01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:24.479
OF THOSE THAT ARE --

01:21:24.546 --> 01:21:25.647
BEING TALKED ABOUT AS WE SPEAK

01:21:25.714 --> 01:21:27.282
WHICH WERE SUPPORTIVE OF AND

01:21:27.349 --> 01:21:27.916
THAT IS THE REFINERY INVESTMENT

01:21:27.983 --> 01:21:29.317
CREDIT.

01:21:29.384 --> 01:21:31.786
AND CARBON CAPTURE SEQUESTRATION.

01:21:31.853 --> 01:21:33.755
WE ACTUALLY ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE

01:21:33.822 --> 01:21:34.522
YOU CANNOT MEET THESE GOALS

01:21:34.589 --> 01:21:36.758
WITHOUT CCS.

01:21:36.825 --> 01:21:37.826
THAT IS TAKING CARBON OUT THE

01:21:37.892 --> 01:21:38.693
ATMOSPHERE AND STARTING ON ROUTE

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:40.595
SO THOSE ARE TWO AREAS THAT CAN

01:21:40.662 --> 01:21:41.896
HELP.

01:21:41.963 --> 01:21:43.164
ON COST CONTAINMENT BUT THERE

01:21:43.231 --> 01:21:44.266
HAS TO BE MORE FOCUSED ON THIS

01:21:44.332 --> 01:21:45.900
PROGRAM AND PASS.

01:21:45.967 --> 01:21:47.469
SO IN CONCLUSION I WANT TO GIVE

01:21:47.535 --> 01:21:48.937
OBVIOUSLY.

01:21:49.004 --> 01:21:50.905
THE REST OF MY THE PANEL MEMBERS

01:21:50.972 --> 01:21:53.408
THAT THERE DO TIME --

01:21:53.475 --> 01:21:56.177
WE THINK THAT YOU OBVIOUSLY AND

01:21:56.244 --> 01:21:57.212
US AND EVERYONE IN THIS

01:21:57.279 --> 01:21:59.514
CONVERSATION REALLY DOES WANT.

01:21:59.581 --> 01:22:01.716
A SUSTAINABLE ENERGY FUTURE BUT

01:22:01.783 --> 01:22:03.618
IT HAS TO BE A BALANCE BETWEEN

01:22:03.685 --> 01:22:05.420
ENVIRONMENT.

01:22:05.487 --> 01:22:07.589
ECONOMY AND SOCIAL PROGRESS

01:22:07.656 --> 01:22:08.757
RIGHT ALL THREE OF THOSE ARE

01:22:08.823 --> 01:22:10.592
VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT FOR

01:22:10.659 --> 01:22:12.527
THIS TO WORK SO WE DON'T HAVE TO

01:22:12.594 --> 01:22:14.129
MAKE A CHOICE BETWEEN.

01:22:14.195 --> 01:22:15.130
YOU KNOW WHETHER WE YOU KNOW

01:22:15.196 --> 01:22:16.598
WHAT TO PROTECT THE PLANET

01:22:16.665 --> 01:22:18.333
PROTECT PROSPERITY OR PROTECT

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:19.634
THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE RIGHT

01:22:19.701 --> 01:22:21.002
WE CAN DO ALL OF THOSE THINGS IF

01:22:21.069 --> 01:22:22.137
WE DO THIS RIGHT AND REALLY

01:22:22.203 --> 01:22:23.672
FOCUS ON THESE PROGRAMS AND WHAT

01:22:23.738 --> 01:22:24.973
IT COST.

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:26.841
AND HOW THEY LINKED TOGETHER SO --

01:22:26.908 --> 01:22:27.442
I THINK WELL BELIEVE WE DON'T

01:22:27.509 --> 01:22:29.844
HAVE TO SACRIFICE ONE AND AGAIN

01:22:29.911 --> 01:22:31.680
I JUST WANTED TO THANK THIS HUGE

01:22:31.746 --> 01:22:33.448
MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THIS PANEL

01:22:33.515 --> 01:22:35.083
IN THIS SELECT COMMITTEE. FOR

01:22:35.150 --> 01:22:36.651
REALLY TAKING THIS ISSUE UP AND

01:22:36.718 --> 01:22:38.586
TAKING IT TO HEART BECAUSE THIS

01:22:38.653 --> 01:22:40.555
IS THESE ARE PORT MATTERS.

01:22:40.622 --> 01:22:42.190
AND COST TO BUSINESSES AND

01:22:42.257 --> 01:22:43.358
CONSUMERS ARE VERY IMPORTANT AS

01:22:43.425 --> 01:22:45.360
CALIFORNIA.

01:22:45.427 --> 01:22:46.094
REACHES ITS VERY AGGRESSIVE

01:22:46.161 --> 01:22:46.928
TARGETS [inaudible]

01:22:46.995 --> 01:22:49.064
THANK YOU.

01:22:49.130 --> 01:22:50.065
THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT AND

THE OTHER BE A NUMBER OF

01:22:50.632 --> 01:22:51.933
QUESTIONS.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.168
THEY SUFFER JUST MONEY WAS GOING

01:22:53.234 --> 01:22:55.403
AND MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANELIST

01:22:55.470 --> 01:23:01.176
WHO WOULD LIKE.

RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY

01:23:15.857 --> 01:23:17.192
WITH THE PUBLIC POLICY PLATFORM

01:23:17.258 --> 01:23:18.393
ADVOCACY BOYS.

01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:20.061
I NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA BUT

AND THIRTY LEADING COMPANIES.

01:23:26.568 --> 01:23:28.536
MANY OF WHOM ARE BASED IN OUR

01:23:28.603 --> 01:23:30.205
OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA I'M

01:23:30.271 --> 01:23:31.539
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

PRODUCERS OF GREATER THAN 90%.

01:23:33.775 --> 01:23:34.876
OF ALL THE ARE IN G.

01:23:34.943 --> 01:23:36.578
PARTICIPATING IN THE AISLE CFS

01:23:36.644 --> 01:23:38.413
TODAY WE BELIEVE THAT REDEEMING

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:40.148
REFUSE THE WASTE THAT SOCIETY

01:23:40.215 --> 01:23:42.650
PRODUCES FOR PRODUCTIVE AND USES.

01:23:42.717 --> 01:23:45.620
IS THE EPITOME OF SUSTAINABILITY.

01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:47.288
RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS ALSO KNOWN

01:23:47.355 --> 01:23:49.824
AS ARE IN G. OR BIO METHANE IS A

01:23:49.891 --> 01:23:51.593
PRODUCT GAS DRIVE FROM THE BIO

01:23:51.659 --> 01:23:53.328
GAS OR RAW METHANE.

01:23:53.395 --> 01:23:54.429
THAT'S EMITTED FROM ORGANIC

01:23:54.496 --> 01:23:56.664
MATERIALS NATURALLY DECOMPOSING

01:23:56.731 --> 01:23:58.366
IN RENEWABLE WASTE STREAMS.

01:23:58.433 --> 01:23:59.667
TODAY OUR ENERGY PRODUCTION

01:23:59.734 --> 01:24:01.002
FACILITIES ARE DEVELOPED TO

01:24:01.069 --> 01:24:02.637
CAPTURE AND CONVERT THAT BIOGAS

01:24:02.704 --> 01:24:04.205
AT LANDFILLS WASTE WATER

01:24:04.272 --> 01:24:05.306
TREATMENT FACILITIES.

01:24:05.373 --> 01:24:06.975
AND DARIUS AND OTHER LIVESTOCK

01:24:07.041 --> 01:24:08.710
OPERATIONS IN A WAY THAT ENABLES

01:24:08.777 --> 01:24:11.045
IT TO BECOME INTERCHANGEABLE

01:24:11.112 --> 01:24:13.181
WITH GEOLOGIC NATURAL GAS.

01:24:13.248 --> 01:24:14.649
CLEANING CONDITION BY A GAS IS

01:24:14.716 --> 01:24:16.584
KNOWN AS RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS

01:24:16.651 --> 01:24:17.819
OR BY AND NOTHING WHICH IS THEN

01:24:17.886 --> 01:24:19.921
COMPATIBLE WITH CNG ANALOGY

01:24:19.988 --> 01:24:21.089
VEHICLES.

01:24:21.156 --> 01:24:23.024
AND CAN BE INJECTED INTO AND

01:24:23.091 --> 01:24:24.592
TRANSPORTED VIA NATURAL GAS

01:24:24.659 --> 01:24:26.227
COMMON CARRIER PIPELINES FOR A

01:24:26.294 --> 01:24:27.862
VARIETY OF AND USES.

01:24:27.929 --> 01:24:28.463
INCLUDING AS AN ULTRA LOW AND

01:24:28.530 --> 01:24:31.800
EVEN [inaudible]

01:24:31.866 --> 01:24:33.234
TEACHING YOUR THE ALTERNATIVE TO

01:24:33.301 --> 01:24:34.702
CAPTURING AND CONVERTING METHANE

01:24:34.769 --> 01:24:37.739
FROM THE SOURCES IS FLARING GAS.

01:24:37.806 --> 01:24:38.940
WHICH COMBUSTS AND WASTE THIS

01:24:39.007 --> 01:24:41.042
VALUABLE ENERGY RICH RESOURCE

01:24:41.109 --> 01:24:43.144
EVEN WORSE THAN FLARING IF

01:24:43.211 --> 01:24:45.413
NOTHING IS COLLECT AT IS NOT

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:47.048
COLLECTED THE GAS WILL ESCAPE

01:24:47.115 --> 01:24:47.849
FUGITIVE LEAD INTO THE

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:50.018
ATMOSPHERE WHERE IT IS EIGHTY

01:24:50.084 --> 01:24:51.619
FOUR TIMES AS POTENT AS CARBON.

01:24:51.686 --> 01:24:52.687
AS CARBON DIOXIDE AS A

01:24:52.754 --> 01:24:54.889
GREENHOUSE GAS --

01:24:54.956 --> 01:24:56.024
I'D ENCOURAGE MEMBERS OF THIS

01:24:56.090 --> 01:24:58.026
COMMITTEE TO REVIEW THE LCS

01:24:58.092 --> 01:24:59.494
DIASPORA ON THAT DESPERATE ON

01:24:59.561 --> 01:25:02.030
THE CURB WEBSITE --

01:25:02.096 --> 01:25:02.897
IT HAS DATA ON VARIOUS RENEWABLE

01:25:02.964 --> 01:25:05.500
FUELS RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS IS

01:25:05.567 --> 01:25:07.302
BY FAR THE LOWEST CARBON FUEL

01:25:07.368 --> 01:25:09.337
AVAILABLE. TO GIVE YOU SOME

01:25:09.404 --> 01:25:10.872
RIVER YOU'LL FIND THERE AS A

01:25:10.939 --> 01:25:12.273
BASELINE DIESEL HAS A CARBON

01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:14.609
INTENSITY LEVEL OF ABOUT A

01:25:14.676 --> 01:25:15.376
HUNDRED GRAMS FOR MAYBE TWO OF

01:25:15.443 --> 01:25:16.544
ENERGY.

01:25:16.611 --> 01:25:17.846
GASOLINE IS AROUND.

01:25:17.912 --> 01:25:19.681
NINETY ELECTRICITY IN CALIFORNIA

01:25:19.747 --> 01:25:23.051
WHEN USES VEHICLE FUEL IS ABOUT.

01:25:23.117 --> 01:25:23.585
THIRTY FIVE THAT'S PRETTY

01:25:23.651 --> 01:25:24.752
IMPRESSIVE THAT'S ALMOST A TWO

01:25:24.819 --> 01:25:26.955
THIRDS REDUCTION IN CARBON

01:25:27.021 --> 01:25:28.289
DENSITY COMPARED TO GASOLINE.

01:25:28.356 --> 01:25:29.958
HOWEVER RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS

01:25:30.024 --> 01:25:32.494
GOES AS LOW AS NEGATIVE TWO

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:33.995
HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE CERTIFIED.

01:25:34.062 --> 01:25:35.964
WITH OTHER EVENLOWER CARB

01:25:36.030 --> 01:25:37.765
INTENSELY SCORES FOR IN THE IN

01:25:37.832 --> 01:25:39.000
THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS.

01:25:39.067 --> 01:25:40.702
THAT'S MORE THAN 210050%

01:25:40.768 --> 01:25:41.636
REDUCTION WHEN COMPARED TO

01:25:41.703 --> 01:25:43.338
DIESEL.

01:25:43.404 --> 01:25:44.672
DRIVING IN NATURAL GAS VEHICLE

01:25:44.739 --> 01:25:46.841
POWERED BY RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS

01:25:46.908 --> 01:25:47.909
ACTUALLY HELPS THE ATMOSPHERE AS

01:25:47.976 --> 01:25:49.577
IT DRIES.

01:25:49.644 --> 01:25:50.378
THIS IS A LOW CARBON DUAL

01:25:50.445 --> 01:25:51.846
STANDARDS OF COURSE CARBON IS

01:25:51.913 --> 01:25:53.815
THE METRIC ON WHICH THERE'S THE

01:25:53.882 --> 01:25:55.016
MOST FOCUS IN THIS DISCUSSION.

01:25:55.083 --> 01:25:56.985
BUT I KNOW THIS BUILDING PEOPLE

01:25:57.051 --> 01:25:57.585
ARE ALSO VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

01:25:57.652 --> 01:25:59.254
KNOX.

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:00.855
I WILL ADD HERE THAT A RECENT

01:26:00.922 --> 01:26:02.290
STUDY FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF

01:26:02.357 --> 01:26:03.658
CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE FOUND THAT

01:26:03.725 --> 01:26:05.260
VEHICLES FUELED BY OUR ANGIE

01:26:05.326 --> 01:26:06.628
KNOWN AS NEAR ZERO EMISSION

01:26:06.694 --> 01:26:07.562
VEHICLES.

01:26:07.629 --> 01:26:09.964
OUR NINETY NINE POINT 8% CLEAN

01:26:10.031 --> 01:26:11.466
IN REGARDS KNOCKS EMISSIONS.

01:26:11.533 --> 01:26:12.734
THE TRANSLATION IS THAT THERE'S

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:14.969
NO MEASURABLE ADDITIONAL IMPACT

01:26:15.036 --> 01:26:16.738
IN THE METRICS OF PUBLIC HEALTH.

01:26:16.804 --> 01:26:18.239
THAT THIS LEGISLATURE CARES

01:26:18.306 --> 01:26:20.141
ABOUT AS MY RESPIRATORY DISEASE

01:26:20.208 --> 01:26:21.843
AND PREMATURE DEATH WHEN

01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:23.278
COMPARED TO A NEAR.

01:26:23.344 --> 01:26:23.945
WHEN COMPARED TO IS YOUR MISSION

01:26:24.012 --> 01:26:25.480
VEHICLE THIS IS IMPORTANT

01:26:25.547 --> 01:26:27.315
BECAUSE THE NEAR ZERO EMISSION

01:26:27.382 --> 01:26:28.883
VEHICLE CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY

01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:30.218
LOWER IN COST THAN A ZERO

01:26:30.285 --> 01:26:31.352
EMISSION VEHICLE?

01:26:31.419 --> 01:26:32.654
MEAN THAT PUBLIC AND PRIVATE

01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:35.023
PLEADS CAN AFFORD MORE CLEAN

01:26:35.089 --> 01:26:36.491
VEHICLES FOR THE SAME BUDGET.

01:26:36.558 --> 01:26:37.792
OUR ENERGY PRODUCTION FACILITIES

01:26:37.859 --> 01:26:39.227
ALSO PRODUCE ADDITIONAL CO

01:26:39.294 --> 01:26:41.329
BENEFITS BY MITIGATING SOIL AND

01:26:41.396 --> 01:26:42.764
WATER IMPACTS OF THE SOURCE

01:26:42.830 --> 01:26:43.932
FACILITIES. FOR EXAMPLE

01:26:43.998 --> 01:26:47.535
POLLUTION BENEFITS FROM.

01:26:47.602 --> 01:26:49.404
HAS BEEN SHOWN.

01:26:49.470 --> 01:26:50.738
TO SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASE

01:26:50.805 --> 01:26:52.840
EMISSIONS OF SOCKS HYDROGEN

01:26:52.907 --> 01:26:54.042
SULFIDE AND MONIA AND VOLATILE

01:26:54.108 --> 01:26:56.010
ORGANIC COMPOUNDS.

01:26:56.077 --> 01:26:57.312
EACH ORANGEY PROJECT ATTRACTS

01:26:57.378 --> 01:26:59.113
BETWEEN TEN AND SEVENTY MILLION

01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:00.315
DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT DEPENDING

01:27:00.381 --> 01:27:01.883

AS PROPOSED UNDER LEGISLATION

01:27:11.459 --> 01:27:12.927
BEING CONSIDERED THIS YEAR WE

01:27:12.994 --> 01:27:15.029
BELIEVE INDUSTRY CAN DEVELOP UP

01:27:15.096 --> 01:27:15.964
TO THREE HUNDRED NEW AREN'T YOU

01:27:16.030 --> 01:27:17.332
PREDICT PRODUCTION FACILITIES

01:27:17.398 --> 01:27:19.233
AND STATE.

01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:21.836
UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO NINETEEN

01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:22.403
EIGHTY EIGHT LEGISLATION AND

01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:23.905
REGULATION THAT HADN'T BEEN

01:27:23.972 --> 01:27:26.274
ADDRESSED IN SALT TWENTY ELEVEN

01:27:26.341 --> 01:27:27.575
THE ORANGEY INDUSTRY IS FORCED

01:27:27.642 --> 01:27:29.277
TO INVEST IN AND BUILD PROJECTS

01:27:29.344 --> 01:27:30.878
OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:27:30.945 --> 01:27:33.348
CALIFORNIANS ARE PS PROGRAM AND

01:27:33.414 --> 01:27:35.249
SIMILAR PROGRAMS IN THIRTY SEVEN

01:27:35.316 --> 01:27:36.351
OTHER STATES WERE RESPONSIBLE

01:27:36.417 --> 01:27:37.619
FOR DRIVING THE DEVELOPMENT AND

01:27:37.685 --> 01:27:39.954
PRODUCTION OF OUR ENERGY UNTIL.

01:27:40.021 --> 01:27:40.722
TWENTY TWELVE WHEN THE VALUE OF

01:27:40.788 --> 01:27:41.990
OUR ENERGY PRODUCED OUT OF STATE

THE PROGRAM A WE'RE PROVIDING IN

01:31:12.033 --> 01:31:14.468
STATE PRODUCTION OF ABOUT 15%.

01:31:14.535 --> 01:31:15.903
ALL THE REST IS IMPORTED

01:31:15.970 --> 01:31:17.538
PRINCIPALLY FROM THE MIDWEST A

CALIFORNIA ETHANOL INDUSTRY HAVE

01:31:31.118 --> 01:31:33.387
BEEN CONSISTENT A LONG STANDING?

01:31:33.454 --> 01:31:34.922
SUPPORTERS OF LOW CARBON FUEL

01:31:34.989 --> 01:31:36.557
STANDARD WE WERE STANDING BY THE

ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER IN. TWO

01:31:40.294 --> 01:31:41.195
THOUSAND AND SEVEN WHEN HE

HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER.

01:31:44.899 --> 01:31:46.400
I SINCE THAT TIME WE'VE BEEN

COALITION OF LOW CARBON.

01:31:49.804 --> 01:31:51.472
A FUEL SUPPLIERS LABOR AND

01:31:54.742 --> 01:31:57.078
SO VERY A BROAD BASED COALITION

01:31:57.144 --> 01:31:58.546
THAT I THINK IT'S BEEN YOU KNOW

01:31:58.613 --> 01:32:00.681
A KEY TO THE SUSTAINABILITY IN

WE CAN HAVE CLEAN FUELS AND GROW

01:32:25.506 --> 01:32:26.908
OUR ECONOMY I THINK HE'LL CFS IS

01:32:26.974 --> 01:32:28.876
A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT.

01:32:28.943 --> 01:32:30.878

I IN ITS TIME IS GONE ON WE SEEN

01:32:56.837 --> 01:32:58.239
DIVERSIFICATION AND RENEWABLE

01:32:58.306 --> 01:32:59.874
NATURAL GAS MORE RENEWABLE

01:32:59.941 --> 01:33:02.443
DIESEL BIODIESEL ELECTRICITY SO

01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:04.145
THAT'S BEEN A REAL SUCCESS OF

01:33:04.211 --> 01:33:05.546
THE PROGRAM IS THAT WHILE.

WE'RE NOW SEEING A

01:33:08.983 --> 01:33:11.385
DIVERSIFICATION INTO OTHER FUEL

01:33:11.452 --> 01:33:12.887
SOURCES AND AND WE WE A PLOT

01:33:12.954 --> 01:33:15.623
THAT NOT JUST.

01:33:46.921 --> 01:33:48.222
IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IN IN

01:33:48.289 --> 01:33:49.957
ETHANOL'S PARTICIPATION.

01:33:50.024 --> 01:33:51.559
IS THAT WE ARE NOT ONLY TO

01:33:51.625 --> 01:33:53.661
INCREMENTAL FUEL SUPPLY LOW

01:33:53.728 --> 01:33:55.496
CARBON HIGH OCTANE FUEL BUT WE

01:33:55.563 --> 01:33:58.966
SELL CONSISTENTLY AT A OF FAIRLY --

01:33:59.033 --> 01:34:02.036
MARKET DISCOUNT TO GASOLINE ARE

01:34:02.103 --> 01:34:04.472
ANYWHERE FROM FIFTY TO SEVENTY

01:34:04.538 --> 01:34:06.273
CENTS A GALLON LESS THAN THE

01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:07.775
PRICE OF WHOLESALE GASOLINE SO

01:34:07.842 --> 01:34:09.276
WE'RE DELIVERING ALL OF THESE

01:34:09.343 --> 01:34:10.845
WONDERFUL ECONOMIC AND

01:34:10.911 --> 01:34:12.613
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS AS A FUEL.

01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:14.115
ON BUT AT THE PUMP WERE ALSO

01:34:14.181 --> 01:34:15.783
LOWERING THE COST SO IF YOU LOOK

01:34:15.850 --> 01:34:17.918
AT SOME OF THE NUMBERS ON TODAY

01:34:17.985 --> 01:34:19.320
LCF ASSN THE GASOLINE POOL.

01:34:19.387 --> 01:34:20.888

01:34:24.558 --> 01:34:26.794
IN THE LAST YEAR WE'RE ACTUALLY.

01:34:26.861 --> 01:34:28.829
IN THE COMMODITY PRICE FOR

01:34:28.896 --> 01:34:30.431
ETHANOL --

01:34:30.498 --> 01:34:32.500
SAVING CLOSER TO A BILLION

01:34:32.566 --> 01:34:32.800

THE COSTS OF COMPLIANCE BUT

01:34:35.703 --> 01:34:37.104
LET'S LOOK AT THE FUELS AND HOW

01:34:37.171 --> 01:34:38.572
THAT INCREMENTAL SUPPLY IS

01:34:38.639 --> 01:34:39.507
ACTUALLY --

01:34:39.573 --> 01:34:40.574
LOWERING THE COST TO CONSUMERS

01:34:40.641 --> 01:34:41.942
AT THE PUMP WHILE PROVIDING

01:34:42.009 --> 01:34:43.844
CHOICE.

01:34:43.911 --> 01:34:45.646
THE LCF* CREATED THE

01:34:45.713 --> 01:34:47.214
INCENTIVES NECESSARY TO DRIVE

01:34:47.281 --> 01:34:49.150
INNOVATION AND INVESTMENT IS

01:34:49.216 --> 01:34:51.218
RESULTED IN REDUCED GREENHOUSE

01:34:51.285 --> 01:34:52.653
GAS EMISSIONS FROM ETHANOL

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:53.988
PRODUCTION.

01:34:54.055 --> 01:34:55.156
CARP HAS CERTIFIED CARBON

01:34:55.222 --> 01:34:56.557
INTENSITIES FOR SOME PRODUCERS

01:34:56.624 --> 01:34:59.460
THAT ARE 4250% BELOW THE CARBON

01:34:59.527 --> 01:35:01.195
INTENSIVE GASOLINE AND THE MOST

01:35:01.262 --> 01:35:03.264
RECENT QUARTERLY DATA SHOWED.

01:35:03.330 --> 01:35:04.465
THE AVERAGE ETHANOL SEE AYE

01:35:06.167 --> 01:35:08.269
IN THE FOURTH QUARTER WAS 31%

01:35:08.335 --> 01:35:10.271
BELOW GASOLINE AND FALLING.

01:35:10.337 --> 01:35:12.106
IN FACT IT IS A MEASURE OF

01:35:12.173 --> 01:35:13.741
SUCCESS OF THE LCF ES AT SINCE

01:35:13.808 --> 01:35:15.142
THE INCEPTION OF THE PROGRAM.

THE AUSSIE OFFENSE HAS BEEN

01:39:59.426 --> 01:40:01.328
TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL ARE IN

01:40:01.395 --> 01:40:02.629
SUPPORTING THE GROWTH OF BODIES

01:40:02.696 --> 01:40:05.165
ON CALIFORNIA BOTH IN IN USAGE

01:40:05.232 --> 01:40:06.667
AND IN A PRODUCTION.

01:40:06.734 --> 01:40:08.669
ARE HISTORICALLY CALIFORNIA HAS

01:40:08.736 --> 01:40:10.037
LAGGED BEHIND THE REST OF THE

01:40:10.104 --> 01:40:11.438
WORLD OUT WHEN IT COMES TO OF

01:40:11.505 --> 01:40:12.306
BIODIESEL.

01:40:12.373 --> 01:40:13.807
BUT NOW IT'S ACTUALLY TAKING A

01:40:13.874 --> 01:40:15.609
LEADERSHIP POSITION --

01:40:15.676 --> 01:40:17.978
THE LTFS FEEL NEUTRAL POLICY

01:40:18.045 --> 01:40:19.947
THAT OTHERS HAVE --

01:40:20.013 --> 01:40:21.315
SPOKE ABOUT --

01:40:21.382 --> 01:40:22.916
HAS ALLOWED BIODIESEL TO STAND

01:40:22.983 --> 01:40:24.918
ON ITS OWN MERITS --

01:40:24.985 --> 01:40:26.653
AND AS A RESULT IT'S REALLY%

01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:28.789
GROWN UP DRAMATICALLY TODAY IT

01:40:28.856 --> 01:40:30.491
GENERATES ABOUT 20% OF ALL THE

01:40:30.557 --> 01:40:33.327
CREDITS HA IN THE SISKIN THE UP

01:40:33.394 --> 01:40:35.095
PROGRAM AND AS NEIL.

01:40:35.162 --> 01:40:36.096
POINTED OUT ABOUT FEELS IN

01:40:36.163 --> 01:40:39.800
GENERAL THERE ARE OVER 90% --

01:40:39.867 --> 01:40:41.735
ALSO LOW CARBON FEEDSTOCKS SUCH

01:40:41.802 --> 01:40:42.936
AS USE COOKING ALL FROM

01:40:43.003 --> 01:40:43.837
RESTAURANT UP PRODUCTION

01:40:43.904 --> 01:40:44.138
[inaudible]

01:40:44.204 --> 01:40:47.307
ON ARE PURSUED NOW AND

01:40:47.374 --> 01:40:49.009
HISTORICALLY AT THE BEGINNING

01:40:49.076 --> 01:40:50.944
THEY WERE REALLY DISCOUNTED THEY

01:40:51.011 --> 01:40:51.845
WERE THERE WERE SEEN AS

01:40:51.912 --> 01:40:52.579
SOMETHING.

01:40:52.646 --> 01:40:54.515
WASTEFUL ANOTHER ACTUALLY MUCH

01:40:54.581 --> 01:40:56.517
MORE VALUABLE WHICH IS GREAT.

01:40:56.583 --> 01:40:57.785
A LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD

01:40:57.851 --> 01:40:59.887
ATTRACTS LOW CARBON BIODIESEL

01:40:59.953 --> 01:41:01.388
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD --

01:41:01.455 --> 01:41:03.857
NOT JUST ALL.

01:41:03.924 --> 01:41:05.826
BUT ALL OVER THE WORLD --

01:41:05.893 --> 01:41:06.794
THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF

01:41:06.860 --> 01:41:08.729
PRODUCTION IN THE STATE --

01:41:08.796 --> 01:41:10.931
AND ALSO I WANT TO POINT OUT

01:41:10.998 --> 01:41:11.965
FROM AN EARLIER STATEMENT WILL

01:41:12.032 --> 01:41:13.300
LOW CARB FEEL STERN STANDARD HAS

01:41:13.367 --> 01:41:15.569
ALSO INSPIRED SIMILAR PROGRAMS

01:41:15.636 --> 01:41:17.337
ARE SUCH AS OREGON.

01:41:17.404 --> 01:41:19.873
WASHINGTON CANADA AND EVEN CHINA

01:41:19.940 --> 01:41:21.341
HOME SO THE WORLD IS REALLY

01:41:21.408 --> 01:41:21.942
PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT WE'RE

01:41:22.009 --> 01:41:22.409
DOING HERE [inaudible]

01:41:22.476 --> 01:41:25.245
ON THE PROGRAM SUPPORTED THE

01:41:25.312 --> 01:41:26.213
GROWTH OF BIODIESEL PRODUCTION

01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:27.414
IN CALIFORNIA --

01:41:27.481 --> 01:41:31.251
QUITE DRAMATICALLY UP PRIMARILY --

01:41:31.318 --> 01:41:32.719
HI THIS IS OUT MOST OF THE

01:41:32.786 --> 01:41:34.021
PLANTS IN THE STATE ARE

01:41:34.087 --> 01:41:34.755
PRODUCING FROM LOW CARBON

01:41:34.822 --> 01:41:36.390
FEEDSTOCKS.

01:41:36.457 --> 01:41:37.758
OTHER EIGHT PLANTS CURRENTLY

01:41:37.825 --> 01:41:39.726
OPERATING MORE ARE BEING BUILT

01:41:39.793 --> 01:41:42.930
AND MORE ARE BEING PLANNED --

01:41:42.996 --> 01:41:44.298
EXPANSION PROJECTS TO HELP OUR

01:41:44.364 --> 01:41:46.033
HAVE HAPPENED AT ALL PLANTS BUT

01:41:46.099 --> 01:41:47.968
MANY ARE COMPLETED AND MANY MORE

01:41:48.035 --> 01:41:49.036
ARE UNDER WAY.

01:41:49.102 --> 01:41:50.437
UP PARTIALLY WITH HELP FROM THE

01:41:50.504 --> 01:41:52.139
ALTERNATIVE AND RENEWABLE FUEL

01:41:52.206 --> 01:41:53.907
AND VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM.

01:41:53.974 --> 01:41:54.741
AND OTHER STATE AND FEDERAL

01:41:54.808 --> 01:41:57.578
PROGRAMS ALL OF THIS DRIVEN BY

01:41:57.644 --> 01:42:00.147
THE LOW CARB FEELS THAT --

01:42:00.214 --> 01:42:01.415
ALL BY A FEEL PLANTS THIS HAS.

01:42:01.482 --> 01:42:02.583
I'M FAIRLY CERTAIN ALL

01:42:02.649 --> 01:42:03.417
BATTLEFIELD PLANTS AND STATE

01:42:03.484 --> 01:42:04.718
HAVE BEEN BUILT AND

01:42:04.785 --> 01:42:06.186
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.

01:42:06.253 --> 01:42:07.821
WHICH PROVIDE GOOD PAYING GREEN

01:42:07.888 --> 01:42:09.356
JOBS AND TRAINING THE THOUSANDS

01:42:09.423 --> 01:42:10.123
OF CALIFORNIA WORKERS WHICH I

01:42:10.190 --> 01:42:11.124
THINK IS [inaudible]

01:42:11.191 --> 01:42:13.460
TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT.

01:42:13.527 --> 01:42:14.428
ON THE LOW CARB FEEL STANDARD

01:42:14.495 --> 01:42:15.762
HAS ENCOURAGED INFRASTRUCTURE

01:42:15.829 --> 01:42:17.498
SPENDING AND BODIES PRODUCTION

01:42:17.564 --> 01:42:18.866
AND CONSUMPTION FROM IN STATE

01:42:18.932 --> 01:42:20.234
FACILITIES.

01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:21.335
RESULTING REALLY IN BILLIONS OF

01:42:21.401 --> 01:42:22.503
DOLLARS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR

01:42:22.569 --> 01:42:23.971
CALIFORNIA.

01:42:24.037 --> 01:42:25.239
UP MORE THAN A THIRD OF ALL

01:42:25.305 --> 01:42:26.540
CALIFORNIA BULK FUEL TERMINALS

01:42:26.607 --> 01:42:27.875
TODAY HAVE INVESTED IN

01:42:27.941 --> 01:42:29.042
INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:42:29.109 --> 01:42:30.110
AND NOW SUPPORT BIODIESEL

01:42:30.177 --> 01:42:31.445
BLENDING AND THAT NUMBER IS

01:42:31.512 --> 01:42:33.180
GROWING --

01:42:33.247 --> 01:42:35.182
RETAIL BLENDING TO BE TWENTY

01:42:35.249 --> 01:42:36.817
WHICH IS A 20% BLEND OF

01:42:36.884 --> 01:42:37.751
BIODIESEL IN WITH PETROLEUM

01:42:37.818 --> 01:42:39.853
DIESEL HAS GROWN EXTENSIVELY TO

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:41.054
INCLUDE THE THREE MAJOR TRUCK

01:42:41.121 --> 01:42:42.823
STOP RETAILERS WHICH INCLUDE

01:42:42.890 --> 01:42:44.291
PILOT FLYING J..

01:42:44.358 --> 01:42:46.894
TROUBLE CENTERS OF AMERICA

01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:49.496
PETROL PLAZA AND LOOKED --

01:42:49.563 --> 01:42:50.731
LOW CARB A FEW STANDARD IS

01:42:50.797 --> 01:42:52.499
DRIVING TREMENDOUS GROWTH IN

01:42:52.566 --> 01:42:53.400
BIODIESEL AND OTHER RENEWABLE

01:42:53.467 --> 01:42:54.601
FUELS IN THIS STATE AND I THINK

01:42:54.668 --> 01:42:57.070
THAT'S I WON A PAUSE THERE

01:42:57.137 --> 01:42:58.972
BECAUSE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

01:42:59.039 --> 01:43:02.276
DEVELOPMENT AND IT'S FAR. TOO

01:43:02.342 --> 01:43:03.477
LARGE EXTENT.

01:43:03.544 --> 01:43:05.045
A DUE TO LOW CARB FEEL STANDARD

01:43:05.112 --> 01:43:06.346
AND AND ITS SUCCESS.

01:43:06.413 --> 01:43:07.814
CALIFORNIA'S LEADING AWAY IS

01:43:07.881 --> 01:43:10.117
LEADING THE WAY AS A RESULT --

01:43:10.183 --> 01:43:12.419
WITH CLIMATE POLICIES ARMED WITH

01:43:12.486 --> 01:43:14.154
CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES HOT WHICH ARE

01:43:14.221 --> 01:43:15.856
PROVIDING BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES

01:43:15.923 --> 01:43:17.024
AND THE JOBS THAT COME ALONG

01:43:17.090 --> 01:43:19.826
WITH THEM --

01:43:19.893 --> 01:43:21.328
THIS ALL RESULTS IN HUGE

01:43:21.395 --> 01:43:22.930
ECONOMIC BENEFITS FOR THE STATE.

01:43:22.996 --> 01:43:25.299
FOR OUR WORKERS HERE --

01:43:25.365 --> 01:43:26.633
THE ENERGY INDUSTRY IS ALREADY

01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:28.235
ADJUSTING IN MAKING REAL PROFITS

01:43:28.302 --> 01:43:30.571
AND AND THEY KNOW THIS --

01:43:30.637 --> 01:43:31.838
I KNOW IT BECAUSE I TRADE WITH

01:43:31.905 --> 01:43:34.107
THEM EVERY DAY THEY ARE INVESTED

01:43:34.174 --> 01:43:35.642
IN YOU KNOW SEVERAL COMPANIES

01:43:35.709 --> 01:43:36.410
HAVE SAID --

01:43:36.476 --> 01:43:39.446
ENDEAVOR IS ONE EXAMPLE WHERE AN

01:43:39.513 --> 01:43:41.381
ENERGY COMPANY WERE WERE

01:43:41.448 --> 01:43:42.115
TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL WERE FEET

01:43:42.182 --> 01:43:43.584
STUCK.

01:43:43.650 --> 01:43:45.986
TO SO THIS TRANSITION IS ALREADY

01:43:46.053 --> 01:43:50.657
UNDER WAY ON AND I WANT ALSO --

01:43:50.724 --> 01:43:52.159
GIVE A REMINDER THAT --

01:43:52.225 --> 01:43:54.561
JUST LIKE ETHANOL BIODIESEL SOLD

01:43:54.628 --> 01:43:56.363
AT A DISCOUNT TO DIESEL SO IT

01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:57.397
HELPS LOWER THE PRICE OF DIESEL

01:43:57.464 --> 01:43:59.399
FUEL IN MANY CASES UP TO ABOUT A

01:43:59.466 --> 01:44:00.100
DOLLAR.

01:44:00.167 --> 01:44:02.102
OR MORE A GALLON DISCOUNTED FROM

01:44:02.169 --> 01:44:04.271
THE PRICE OF DIESEL FUEL --

01:44:04.338 --> 01:44:06.873
SO I JUST WANT TO CLOSE WITH.

01:44:06.940 --> 01:44:08.508
SAYING THE WORLD IS WATCHING YOU

01:44:08.575 --> 01:44:10.210
KNOW REALLY WATCHING CAREFULLY

01:44:10.277 --> 01:44:12.112
WHAT CALIFORNIA DOES.

01:44:12.179 --> 01:44:13.313
ALSO FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS

01:44:13.380 --> 01:44:15.048
ARE WATCHING.

01:44:15.115 --> 01:44:17.050
WHAT THE STATE DOESN'T THERE'S

01:44:17.117 --> 01:44:17.651
TREMENDOUS SUPPORT I THINK IN

01:44:17.718 --> 01:44:20.587
THE STATE? FOR PROGRAMS ARE SUCH

01:44:20.654 --> 01:44:21.555
AS LUKEWARM FEEL STANDARD AND

01:44:21.622 --> 01:44:22.889
CAP AND TRADE WHICH ARE

01:44:22.956 --> 01:44:25.058
DIFFERENT CAP AND TRADE IT TALKS

01:44:25.125 --> 01:44:26.426
ABOUT PRODUCTION LIKE.

01:44:26.493 --> 01:44:27.728
FACTORIES THINGS LIKE THAT LOOK

01:44:27.794 --> 01:44:29.429
CORPORATE FEEL CENTERED STRICTLY

01:44:29.496 --> 01:44:32.099
FOCUSES ON TRANSPORTATION FUELS

01:44:32.165 --> 01:44:33.033
SO THAT THAT'S OF THE DIFFERENCE

01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:35.035
I THINK THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION

01:44:35.102 --> 01:44:36.036
EARLIER WANT TO CLARIFY THAT

01:44:36.103 --> 01:44:36.336
[inaudible]

01:44:36.403 --> 01:44:37.571
ARM.

01:44:37.638 --> 01:44:39.006
YOU KNOW OUR INDUSTRY BELIEVES

01:44:39.072 --> 01:44:40.340
THAT LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD

01:44:40.407 --> 01:44:41.742
SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED AND

01:44:41.808 --> 01:44:44.544
EXTENDED TO TWENTY THIRTY AS

01:44:44.611 --> 01:44:45.679
PART BECAUSE PROPOSED

01:44:45.746 --> 01:44:45.979
[inaudible]

01:44:46.046 --> 01:44:47.948
THANKS.

01:44:48.015 --> 01:44:50.017
THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT IT.

01:44:50.083 --> 01:44:51.385
JUST REAL QUICK BECAUSE YOU

01:44:51.451 --> 01:44:53.654
TOUCHED ON IS A 20% OF THE

01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:54.821
CREDITS OR GENERATED BY PILE

01:44:54.888 --> 01:44:57.557
FEELS.

01:44:57.624 --> 01:44:59.626
BIODIESEL BUT BIODIESEL OKAY AND

01:44:59.693 --> 01:45:02.362
OILFIELDS GENERATE OVER 90%.

01:45:02.429 --> 01:45:05.065
OVER 90% SAU MUCH.

01:45:05.132 --> 01:45:07.701
FOR NATURAL GAS AND ETHANOL

01:45:07.768 --> 01:45:09.202
THINK RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS IS

01:45:09.269 --> 01:45:12.139
AROUND 10% NEED A LITTLE OVER.

01:45:12.205 --> 01:45:15.642
AND ETHEL'S CLOSE 250%

01:45:15.709 --> 01:45:15.942
[inaudible]

01:45:16.009 --> 01:45:19.846
DIESEL.

01:45:19.913 --> 01:45:21.381
RELIABLE DIESELS ABOUT 20% AS

01:45:21.448 --> 01:45:25.619
WELL 252025% GOT IT [inaudible]

01:45:25.686 --> 01:45:32.225
ALRIGHT.

01:45:32.292 --> 01:45:33.026
SO APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S

01:45:33.093 --> 01:45:34.394
TESTIMONY BUT LET ME.

01:45:34.461 --> 01:45:35.696
ASK A SPECIFIC QUESTION SO NOW

01:45:35.762 --> 01:45:36.663
THAT.

01:45:36.730 --> 01:45:38.865
WE HAVE EL CFS WE HAVE OUR

01:45:38.932 --> 01:45:40.967
TARGETS GOING TOWARDS TWENTY

01:45:41.034 --> 01:45:41.835
TWENTY AND POSSIBLY TWENTY

01:45:41.902 --> 01:45:42.602
THIRTY DEPENDING ON WHAT AIR

01:45:42.669 --> 01:45:45.405
BECOMES OUT WITH --

01:45:45.472 --> 01:45:48.508
WE'RE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES.

01:45:48.575 --> 01:45:50.644
AND EACH OF YOUR INDUSTRIES FACE

01:45:50.711 --> 01:45:52.913
AS WE REACH THE LE CARBON.

01:45:52.979 --> 01:45:55.215
INTENSITY.

01:45:55.282 --> 01:45:56.917
AT TARGETS COMING.

01:45:56.983 --> 01:46:00.020
WHAT WHAT'S THE BIGGEST?

01:46:00.087 --> 01:46:00.620
THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO PREPARE

01:46:00.687 --> 01:46:01.321
FOR IF.

01:46:01.388 --> 01:46:03.223
IF THOSE WERE INCREASED THOSE

01:46:03.290 --> 01:46:07.027
TARGETS WERE INCREASES A TWENTY

01:46:07.094 --> 01:46:08.028
THIRTY I'LL START AND END LEASE

01:46:08.095 --> 01:46:09.663
AND THEN OBVIOUSLY OTHERS CAN

01:46:09.730 --> 01:46:13.033
CAN WEIGH IN BUT FIRST OF ALL.

01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:15.035
LET THIS IS A PRETTY ROSY

01:46:15.102 --> 01:46:17.337
PICTURE THAT WAS PAINTED --

01:46:17.404 --> 01:46:19.306
I THINK WE JUST NEED TO REMIND

01:46:19.372 --> 01:46:20.741
OURSELVES WHY DID THE A

01:46:20.807 --> 01:46:22.609
RESOURCES BOARD REDUCE THEIR

01:46:22.676 --> 01:46:25.746
CARBON INTENSITY FROM 10% TWENTY

01:46:25.812 --> 01:46:27.514
TWENTY TWO SEVEN POINT FIVE AND

01:46:27.581 --> 01:46:28.115
TWENTY TWENTY BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:46:28.181 --> 01:46:29.716
WORRIED ABOUT COST.

01:46:29.783 --> 01:46:31.952
RIGHT SO AGAIN THE COST ISSUE

01:46:32.018 --> 01:46:35.021
HERE IS REALLY IMPORTANT WHAT IS

01:46:35.088 --> 01:46:37.057
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CAP AND

01:46:37.124 --> 01:46:37.791
TRADE IN LOW CARBON FUEL

01:46:37.858 --> 01:46:38.725
STANDARD.

01:46:38.792 --> 01:46:40.560
ONES ALLOT MORE COST EFFECTIVE

01:46:40.627 --> 01:46:42.129
THAN THE OTHER.

01:46:42.195 --> 01:46:44.064
WHY OUR BIO FUELS NOT ALLOWED TO

01:46:44.131 --> 01:46:47.701
ACCESS CAP AND TRADE REVENUES

01:46:47.768 --> 01:46:48.001
[inaudible]

01:46:48.068 --> 01:46:50.003
GOOD QUESTION.

01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:51.638
SO WHY ARE WE FOCUSING ON THE

01:46:51.705 --> 01:46:53.640
MOST THE LEAST COST EFFECTIVE

01:46:53.707 --> 01:46:55.408
PROGRAM RATHER THAN THE MOST

01:46:55.475 --> 01:46:56.843
COST EFFECTIVE PROGRAM AS WE GO

01:46:56.910 --> 01:46:58.845
FORWARD --

01:46:58.912 --> 01:47:00.547
AND IF WE'RE GONNA STAY WITH A

01:47:00.614 --> 01:47:02.048
LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD AND I

01:47:02.115 --> 01:47:03.083
THINK ONE OF THE BEST THINGS

01:47:03.150 --> 01:47:04.451
THIS COMMITTEE COULD ASK US TO

01:47:04.518 --> 01:47:06.353
DO IS BRING YOU BACK. TEN BIG

01:47:06.419 --> 01:47:09.556
BOLD IDEAS ON HOW WE CAN REDUCE

01:47:09.623 --> 01:47:12.359
COST.

01:47:12.425 --> 01:47:13.426
AS ROSY AS THE PICTURE WAS

01:47:13.493 --> 01:47:15.028
PAINTED.

01:47:15.095 --> 01:47:17.764
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE THE

01:47:17.831 --> 01:47:19.332
PRICE OF A CREDIT FOR LOW CARBON

01:47:19.399 --> 01:47:20.600
FUEL STANDARD IS A HUNDRED AND

01:47:20.667 --> 01:47:22.035
FIFTY DOLLARS.

01:47:22.102 --> 01:47:25.305
PER TON VERSES.

01:47:25.372 --> 01:47:27.040
FIFTEEN SO WHY DO ECONOMISTS

01:47:27.107 --> 01:47:30.377
FROM HARVARD AND BERKELEY.

01:47:30.443 --> 01:47:31.945
SUPPORT CAP AND TRADE AND REALLY

01:47:32.012 --> 01:47:33.380
WONDER WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH A

01:47:33.446 --> 01:47:34.714
LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD IT'S

01:47:34.781 --> 01:47:37.017
DUPLICATIVE IT DEPRESSES THE

01:47:37.083 --> 01:47:38.718
PRICE OF CAP TRADE.

01:47:38.785 --> 01:47:41.755
IT'S UNNECESSARY NOW WE'RE NOT.

01:47:41.822 --> 01:47:43.290
SAYING TO ABANDON LOW CARBON

01:47:43.356 --> 01:47:44.224
FUEL CENTER THOUGH I'D LOVE TO

01:47:44.291 --> 01:47:45.325
PROPOSE THAT.

01:47:45.392 --> 01:47:47.460
HOWEVER SINCE CALIFORNIA SEEMS

01:47:47.527 --> 01:47:49.896
TO BE WED TO IT LET'S AT LEAST.

01:47:49.963 --> 01:47:51.865
TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK

01:47:51.932 --> 01:47:54.534
OURSELVES WHAT IS THE BEST WAY

01:47:54.601 --> 01:47:56.770
TO APPROACH THIS PROGRAM AS WE

01:47:56.837 --> 01:47:57.804
HAVE DONE WITH CAP AND TRADE

01:47:57.871 --> 01:47:59.239
BECAUSE WE'RE SPENDING A LOT OF

01:47:59.306 --> 01:48:00.507
TIME ON CAP AND TRADE.

01:48:00.574 --> 01:48:02.409
VERY AGGRESSIVE TARGETS WHICH WE

01:48:02.475 --> 01:48:05.278
SUPPORT BUT WITH A KEEN EYE ON

01:48:05.345 --> 01:48:06.880
PRICE CEILING SPEED BUMPS

01:48:06.947 --> 01:48:09.549
OFFSETS ALL OF THOSE ARE REALLY

01:48:09.616 --> 01:48:10.951
GOOD COST CONTAINMENT MEASURES

01:48:11.017 --> 01:48:12.519
ON A REALLY EXPENSIVE AGGRESSIVE

01:48:12.586 --> 01:48:14.321
PROGRAM.

01:48:14.387 --> 01:48:16.056
AND AS YOU HEARD FROM THE LA OAK.

01:48:16.122 --> 01:48:17.424
THIS IS NOT THE MOST COST

01:48:17.490 --> 01:48:18.959
EFFECTIVE PROGRAM.

01:48:19.025 --> 01:48:21.828
AND THE MARKET CLEARING PRICE

01:48:21.895 --> 01:48:22.863
MECHANISM IS NOT THE BEST

01:48:22.929 --> 01:48:23.163
[inaudible]

01:48:23.230 --> 01:48:25.098
SO.

01:48:25.165 --> 01:48:26.399
THERE'S LIKE I CONTINUE TO SAY

01:48:26.466 --> 01:48:28.034
THERE'S A LOT OF AREAS OF

01:48:28.101 --> 01:48:29.769
IMPROVEMENT IF WERE GOING TO

01:48:29.836 --> 01:48:32.005
HAVE ALL OF THESE VARIOUS

01:48:32.072 --> 01:48:33.139
PROGRAMS.

01:48:33.206 --> 01:48:33.740
MOVING TOGETHER TO MEET THESE

01:48:33.807 --> 01:48:36.343
GOALS THAT NOW APPRECIATE THAT

01:48:36.409 --> 01:48:37.577
AND I DO REMEMBER ASKING THE LA

01:48:37.644 --> 01:48:39.112
OF THE QUESTION OF DUPLICATIVE

01:48:39.179 --> 01:48:40.914
IN --

01:48:40.981 --> 01:48:41.815
WHETHER SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE

01:48:41.882 --> 01:48:43.049
THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE AND

01:48:43.116 --> 01:48:44.584
THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT WE

01:48:44.651 --> 01:48:45.752
AS LEGISLATORS WHO HAVE TO DEAL

01:48:45.819 --> 01:48:46.686
WITH WHETHER IT'S A NEW

01:48:46.753 --> 01:48:48.188
LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL.

01:48:48.255 --> 01:48:49.589
OR HAVING TO DEAL WITH THE

01:48:49.656 --> 01:48:51.024
REGULATIONS AS THEY ARE BE COMES

01:48:51.091 --> 01:48:53.026
OUT WITHIN --

01:48:53.093 --> 01:48:54.661
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND --

01:48:54.728 --> 01:48:55.929
WHAT THEY ULTIMATELY DO COME OUT

01:48:55.996 --> 01:48:57.264
WITH THEM WORKING WITH THE

01:48:57.330 --> 01:48:58.698
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AS WE LOOK AT

01:48:58.765 --> 01:49:00.100
THE POLICIES MOVING FORWARD?

01:49:00.166 --> 01:49:02.068
WHAT IS COST EFFECTIVE WHAT DOES

01:49:02.135 --> 01:49:03.370
IT MEAN FOR CONSUMERS AND

01:49:03.436 --> 01:49:05.338
CALIFORNIANS AND --

01:49:05.405 --> 01:49:07.741
I'LL LET EVERYONE ANSWER BUT YOU

01:49:07.807 --> 01:49:10.110
KNOW I CAN LEADS TO THIS.

01:49:10.176 --> 01:49:11.378
TO MY SECOND QUESTION WHAT DOES

01:49:11.444 --> 01:49:13.046
WHEN WE TALKING ABOUT --

01:49:13.113 --> 01:49:14.514
THE FLAMES TO OUT OF STATE

01:49:14.581 --> 01:49:15.682
BUSINESSES I WANTED UNDERSTAND

01:49:15.749 --> 01:49:16.583
OF THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:49:16.650 --> 01:49:17.984
BECAUSE EVERYONE TALKED ABOUT

01:49:18.051 --> 01:49:19.619
THEIR IN STATE PRODUCTION.

01:49:19.686 --> 01:49:21.421
BUT IS THE ELSEVIER LCF ES

01:49:21.488 --> 01:49:23.456
PROGRAM GROWING IN STATE

01:49:23.523 --> 01:49:24.024
PRODUCTION ARE AS OPPOSED TO

01:49:24.090 --> 01:49:24.958
JUST.

01:49:25.025 --> 01:49:26.693
BRINGING IT IN FROM OUT OF STATE

01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:28.695
IN THAT WERE SELLING THOSE CRAP.

01:49:28.762 --> 01:49:30.397
BUT WE COULDN'T ADDRESS FIRST

01:49:30.463 --> 01:49:31.531
QUESTION FIRST YOU HAVE THAT ON

01:49:31.598 --> 01:49:33.099
THERE AND THE FIRST QUESTION I I

01:49:33.166 --> 01:49:34.701
DON'T THINK THERE IS IT.

01:49:34.768 --> 01:49:36.636
THAT IS DUPLICATIVE TO HAVE THE

01:49:36.703 --> 01:49:39.572
LC AT BASS AND AND CAP AND TRADE.

01:49:39.639 --> 01:49:41.641
BUT 40% OF ALL OF OUR GREENHOUSE

01:49:41.708 --> 01:49:42.142
GAS EMISSIONS COME FROM

01:49:42.208 --> 01:49:43.777
TRANSPORTATION.

01:49:43.843 --> 01:49:45.979
TOLL IS ASINGLE LARGEST --

01:49:46.046 --> 01:49:48.315
HHG IMPACTOR I THINK IT'S VERY

01:49:48.381 --> 01:49:49.649
APPROPRIATE TO HAVE A PROGRAM IS

01:49:49.716 --> 01:49:50.684
VERY SPECIFIC [inaudible] TO

01:49:50.750 --> 01:49:52.752
TRANSPORTATION --

01:49:52.819 --> 01:49:55.288
AND THAT IS WHAT THE L. CFS IS

01:49:55.355 --> 01:49:57.023
DOING CAP AND TRADE IS MORE

01:49:57.090 --> 01:49:59.359
GENERAL ECONOMY WHY I ALSO WITH

01:49:59.426 --> 01:50:01.127
ALL DUE RESPECT CATHY I DON'T

01:50:01.194 --> 01:50:01.828
THINK IT'S ARE.

01:50:01.895 --> 01:50:03.797
YOU COMPARE UNDER AND FIFTY

01:50:03.863 --> 01:50:04.331
DOLLAR --

01:50:04.397 --> 01:50:05.966
LCF ASKREDDIT TO A FIFTEEN

01:50:06.032 --> 01:50:07.834
DOLLAR ONE IS AGAIN ECONOMY WIDE

01:50:07.901 --> 01:50:09.970
ACROSS TOUCHING A LOT MORE

01:50:10.036 --> 01:50:11.671
INDUSTRIES COLLECTING HOLESHOT

01:50:11.738 --> 01:50:13.139
MORE MONEY COSTING CONSUMERS A

01:50:13.206 --> 01:50:14.841
LOT MORE THAN WHEN YOU LOOK AT

01:50:14.908 --> 01:50:16.543
WHAT IS THE ACTUAL PER GALLON

01:50:16.609 --> 01:50:16.776
IMPACT.

01:50:16.843 --> 01:50:20.747
ON ON ON THE CREDITS IN THE

01:50:20.814 --> 01:50:21.314
HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT'S A AN

01:50:21.381 --> 01:50:23.583
APPLE AND AN ORANGE AND BE OF

01:50:23.650 --> 01:50:25.452
VALUE WELL WE CAN LOOK AT IT FOR

01:50:25.518 --> 01:50:26.052
YOU KNOW.

01:50:26.119 --> 01:50:27.387
CENTS PER GALLON IF YOU PREFER

01:50:27.454 --> 01:50:30.323
BECAUSE THAT'S PRETTY APPLES.

01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:31.658
TO AND A VERY VERY COMPETITIVE

01:50:31.725 --> 01:50:32.993
IN THAT REGARD THAT'S BEFORE YOU

01:50:33.059 --> 01:50:35.095
CONSIDER IN THE IN THE CASE OF

01:50:35.161 --> 01:50:37.097
ETHANOL BIODIESEL.

01:50:37.163 --> 01:50:38.064
AYE AND AND RENEWABLE MATCH GAPS

01:50:38.131 --> 01:50:39.666
THAT MATTER THAT THESE ARE LESS

01:50:39.733 --> 01:50:41.468
COSTLY A THEN THAT THE

01:50:41.534 --> 01:50:43.003
PATROLLING ALTERNATIVES SO IT'S

01:50:43.069 --> 01:50:46.106
THERE THERE'S A LOTS OF WAYS TO

01:50:46.172 --> 01:50:47.874
LOOK AT THIS AND LOTS OF WAYS.

01:50:47.941 --> 01:50:48.708
TO SLICE AND DICE THAT NET

01:50:48.775 --> 01:50:49.909
NANNIES TO BE DONE TOGETHER --

01:50:49.976 --> 01:50:51.778
A FULL LOOK AT IT IN TERMS OF

01:50:51.845 --> 01:50:52.879
THE AND STATE THAT THERE'S NO

01:50:52.946 --> 01:50:55.882
QUESTION AT THE THE LCMS PROGRAM.

01:50:55.949 --> 01:50:57.684
IS ABSOLUTELY.

01:50:57.751 --> 01:51:00.553
CRITICAL AND OF THE AND BUILDING

01:51:00.620 --> 01:51:01.354
MORE BIOFUEL PRODUCTION IN THE

01:51:01.421 --> 01:51:03.356
STATE OF OUR COST OF DOING

01:51:03.423 --> 01:51:05.025
EVERYTHING ARE HIGHER THAN OUR

01:51:05.091 --> 01:51:06.493
COMPETITORS IN THE MIDWEST.

01:51:06.559 --> 01:51:08.261
OF THAT BECAUSE OF THAT THE

01:51:08.328 --> 01:51:10.263
POLICIES HERE ARE BEING CLOSE TO

01:51:10.330 --> 01:51:12.132
THIS MARKET HAVING VERY CLEAN

01:51:12.198 --> 01:51:13.366
SOURCES OF ELECTRICITY

01:51:13.433 --> 01:51:16.369
OPPORTUNITIES TO TO REALLY --

01:51:16.436 --> 01:51:18.138
AKC COLLABORATE WITH THE DAIRY

01:51:18.204 --> 01:51:19.539
INDUSTRY A TO BRING IN THE BIO

01:51:19.606 --> 01:51:23.176
GAS YOU KNOW AND AND TO MONETIZE

01:51:23.243 --> 01:51:23.543
THAT THROUGH --

01:51:23.610 --> 01:51:24.310
TO CARBON.

01:51:24.377 --> 01:51:25.779
CREDIT PRICING WHICH IS CARBON

01:51:25.845 --> 01:51:26.846
PRICING --

01:51:26.913 --> 01:51:30.917
WE THAT WE HAVE A REAL INCENTIVE --

01:51:30.984 --> 01:51:32.585
TO TO TO BRING AND AND LOTS OF

01:51:32.652 --> 01:51:35.388
NEW INVESTMENT AND GET THAT 15%

01:51:35.455 --> 01:51:36.322
TO YOU KNOW WAS I GOVERNOR

01:51:36.389 --> 01:51:38.258
SCHWARZENEGGER WHO HAD A 40%

01:51:38.324 --> 01:51:39.059
GOAL.

01:51:39.125 --> 01:51:41.561
I BELIEVE BY TWENTY FORTY OR SO

01:51:41.628 --> 01:51:43.029
I FEEL PRODUCTION AND AND WE CAN

01:51:43.096 --> 01:51:44.764
GET THERE BUT WE NEED LONG TERM

01:51:44.831 --> 01:51:46.666
POLICIES THAT'S WHY WE SUPPORT.

01:51:46.733 --> 01:51:49.402
THE EXTENSION OF THE LCF* TO

01:51:49.469 --> 01:51:50.136
TWENTY THIRTY A WE NEED A

01:51:50.203 --> 01:51:52.205
CERTAINTY ANTIC HOW THOSE

01:51:52.272 --> 01:51:53.540
MARKETS ARE GOING TO PERFORM.

01:51:53.606 --> 01:51:55.241
ARM AND ALSO IN THE CASE OF OF

01:51:55.308 --> 01:51:57.777
ETHANOL A WE NEED ACCESS TO MORE

01:51:57.844 --> 01:51:59.813
THE GASOLINE TANK AGAIN ACCESS

01:51:59.879 --> 01:52:01.648
OPTIONS FOR THE REFINERS TO

01:52:01.714 --> 01:52:04.017
BLEND MORE THAN. 10% ETHANOL SO

01:52:04.084 --> 01:52:05.518
WE CAN FURTHER REDUCE THE COST

01:52:05.585 --> 01:52:07.220
OF GASOLINE AS WELL AS FURTHER

01:52:07.287 --> 01:52:09.289
REDUCE CARBON INTENSITY SUDDENLY

01:52:09.355 --> 01:52:12.358
JUST CLARIFY SO HE SAID 15% OF

01:52:12.425 --> 01:52:13.626
OF THE IN STATE COMES FROM

01:52:13.693 --> 01:52:16.129
ETHANOL BUT THE ENGINES.

01:52:16.196 --> 01:52:18.498
FOR A CAR.

01:52:18.565 --> 01:52:19.666
RIGHT NOW THEY'RE TAKING 10%

01:52:19.732 --> 01:52:21.234
LANGUAGE SO THEY COULD ACTUALLY

01:52:21.301 --> 01:52:23.570
GO UP 215% THEY CAN VIRTUALLY

01:52:23.636 --> 01:52:24.904
I'M SO THAT THE EPA HAS

01:52:24.971 --> 01:52:25.872
CERTIFIED THAT --

01:52:25.939 --> 01:52:28.408
THAT ALL CARS MODEL YEAR TWO

01:52:28.475 --> 01:52:29.976
THOUSAND AND NEWER A CAN RUN ON

01:52:30.043 --> 01:52:31.778
15% PLANS THAT IS THE VAST

01:52:31.845 --> 01:52:35.081
MAJORITY OF THE OF THE CARS ON

01:52:35.148 --> 01:52:36.816
THE ON THE ROAD TODAY SO YES --%

01:52:36.883 --> 01:52:38.418
VIRTUALLY ALL THE CARS IN

01:52:38.485 --> 01:52:40.787
CALIFORNIA CAN RUN ON A 15% PLAN

01:52:40.854 --> 01:52:42.255
WHAT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS

01:52:42.322 --> 01:52:44.757
JUST A AN OPTION FOR REFINERS TO

01:52:44.824 --> 01:52:46.126
BE ABLE TO OFFER THAT.

01:52:46.192 --> 01:52:48.795
I THAT FUEL AYE TO THE A TO THE

01:52:48.862 --> 01:52:50.196
CONSUMERS --

01:52:50.263 --> 01:52:51.731
AND LET THEM LET THEM CHOOSE AND

01:52:51.798 --> 01:52:52.332
WE AND WE FEEL THAT THAT'S A

01:52:52.398 --> 01:52:55.735
VERY VALUABLE TOOL IN THEY ELSE

01:52:55.802 --> 01:52:57.737
IT HAS TO BOXES TO US. TO

01:52:57.804 --> 01:53:00.573
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES

01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:02.509
TO TO WILL HAVE THE HIGHER PLANS

01:53:02.575 --> 01:53:04.344
TO REDUCE CARBON INTENSITY.

01:53:04.410 --> 01:53:05.545
THAT ALONE EVERYBODY ANSWER WILL

01:53:05.612 --> 01:53:07.614
COME BACK.

01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:08.181
TO YOU CAN FOR COALITION FOR

01:53:08.248 --> 01:53:10.016
RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS --

01:53:10.083 --> 01:53:11.518
DO YOU BACKING ON WHAT NEIL SAID

01:53:11.584 --> 01:53:13.720
I THINK THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE

01:53:13.786 --> 01:53:14.821
FROM OUR ORGANIZATIONS

01:53:14.888 --> 01:53:17.023
PERSPECTIVE --

01:53:17.090 --> 01:53:18.858
IS REALLY MARKET CERTAINTY SO

01:53:18.925 --> 01:53:21.294
WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO OBTAIN

01:53:21.361 --> 01:53:23.396
FINANCING BASED ON A TRADABLE

01:53:23.463 --> 01:53:26.132
CREDIT THAT HAS HUGE

01:53:26.199 --> 01:53:28.067
FLUCTUATIONS IN PRICE --

01:53:28.134 --> 01:53:28.668
DUE TO WHATEVER THE NEWS STORY

01:53:28.735 --> 01:53:31.771
WAS THAT WHATEVER CAR MAY HAVE

01:53:31.838 --> 01:53:33.873
SAID IN A WORKSHOP AND PRICES GO

01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:35.642
UP AND DOWN AND IT'SVERY HARD

01:53:35.708 --> 01:53:36.976
TO OBTAIN FINANCING MARKETS ARE

01:53:37.043 --> 01:53:39.946
INDEED HUGE FOR US --

01:53:40.013 --> 01:53:42.182
PURSUANT TO SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY

01:53:42.248 --> 01:53:43.616
THREE THERE WAS A PROPOSAL TO

01:53:43.683 --> 01:53:45.285
CREATE AN ALTERNATIVE FINANCING

01:53:45.351 --> 01:53:47.453
MECHANISM THAT WOULD BE --

01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:49.856
RUN SOMEHOW THROUGH THE STATE --

01:53:49.923 --> 01:53:50.957
SO MAYBE IT WOULD BE SOME KIND

01:53:51.024 --> 01:53:52.392
OF A PUT OPTION AT OUR STATE

01:53:52.458 --> 01:53:53.426
COULD BECOME SOME KIND OF A

01:53:53.493 --> 01:53:54.661
BUYER OF LAST RESORT SOMETHING

01:53:54.727 --> 01:53:55.461
THAT WOULD.

01:53:55.528 --> 01:53:56.963
CREATE ADDITIONAL CERTAINTY FOR

01:53:57.030 --> 01:53:57.997
THE MARKET SO THAT WE CAN GO OUT

01:53:58.064 --> 01:54:00.133
AND AND OBTAIN CAPITAL AND SO

01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:01.901
THAT WOULD BE AND MY TAKE ON

01:54:01.968 --> 01:54:02.702
WHAT THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE

01:54:02.769 --> 01:54:04.170
SHOULD BE IN IN REALLY SCALING

01:54:04.237 --> 01:54:06.639
UP AND TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE

01:54:06.706 --> 01:54:08.508
AND ENHANCE TARGET.

01:54:08.575 --> 01:54:09.976
ON THE IN STATE VERSUS OUT OF

01:54:10.043 --> 01:54:11.477
STATE CONVERSATION SO OUR ENERGY

01:54:11.544 --> 01:54:13.713
IS A LITTLE BIT UNIQUE BECAUSE

01:54:13.780 --> 01:54:15.248
AS I MENTIONED IN MY TESTIMONY.

01:54:15.315 --> 01:54:16.683
WE HAD SOME VERY ONEROUS

01:54:16.749 --> 01:54:18.318
PIPELINE INJECTIONS STANDARDS IN

01:54:18.384 --> 01:54:20.954
CALIFORNIA THAT ESSENTIALLY MADE

01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:22.855
IT COST PROHIBITIVE TO INJECT IN

01:54:22.922 --> 01:54:25.158
STATE AND SO THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY

01:54:25.225 --> 01:54:26.926
WAS DEVELOPED OUT OF STATE. FOR

01:54:26.993 --> 01:54:28.494
CALIFORNIA MARKET ALMOST

01:54:28.561 --> 01:54:30.763
ENTIRELY DRIVEN BY THE LCF S. --

01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:32.065
STACKED ON TOP OF THE RENEWABLE

01:54:32.131 --> 01:54:34.033
FUEL STANDARD --

01:54:34.100 --> 01:54:36.236
THAT'S CHANGING AT JUST A COUPLE

01:54:36.302 --> 01:54:38.137
WEEKS AGO THAT CALIFORNIA

01:54:38.204 --> 01:54:38.805
COUNCIL FOR SCIENCE AND

01:54:38.871 --> 01:54:40.907
TECHNOLOGY RELEASED A STUDY THAT

01:54:40.974 --> 01:54:42.408
HAD SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW

01:54:42.475 --> 01:54:44.811
WE CAN LOWER THE STANDARDS --

01:54:44.877 --> 01:54:46.412
TO ENABLE ON IN STATE MARKET.

01:54:46.479 --> 01:54:47.814
I WILL SAY THAT THE CURRENT

01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:50.183
RULES OF THE LC FS AND THE WAY

01:54:50.250 --> 01:54:52.318
THAT THE CARBON INTENSITY

01:54:52.385 --> 01:54:53.620
CALCULATION IS MEASURED.

01:54:53.686 --> 01:54:55.855
THE USE OF SOMETHING THAT IS

01:54:55.922 --> 01:54:57.523
CALLED THE GREEK MODEL AND

01:54:57.590 --> 01:54:58.725
THAT'S DONE BY THE FEDERAL

01:54:58.791 --> 01:55:00.760
ARGONNE NATIONAL LABORATORY.

01:55:00.827 --> 01:55:03.930
AND IT'S VERY THOROUGH IT'S IT

01:55:03.997 --> 01:55:05.231
DOES CREATE AN EVEN PLAYING

01:55:05.298 --> 01:55:06.566
FIELD FOR CARBON INTENSITY FROM

01:55:06.633 --> 01:55:08.268
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

01:55:08.334 --> 01:55:10.503
AND AND SO BY DEFINITION THAT

01:55:10.570 --> 01:55:13.840
MODEL WILL GIVE A LEG UP TO AN

01:55:13.906 --> 01:55:16.042
IN STATE PROJECT BECAUSE YOU

01:55:16.109 --> 01:55:17.910
HAVE TO TRANSPORT FUEL FURTHER

01:55:17.977 --> 01:55:18.845
IF IT'S OUT OF STATE.

01:55:18.911 --> 01:55:19.979
AND YOU GET DEEMED ON YOUR

01:55:20.046 --> 01:55:21.414
CARBON INTENSITY I THINK

01:55:21.481 --> 01:55:23.449
UNFORTUNATELY TO DATE THAT

01:55:23.516 --> 01:55:24.951
DIFFERENCE HAVE HASN'T BEEN

01:55:25.018 --> 01:55:26.653
ENOUGH. TO EVEN THE PLAYING

01:55:26.719 --> 01:55:28.221
FIELD BETWEEN IN STATE AND OUT

01:55:28.288 --> 01:55:29.656
OF STATE PROJECTS AND SO YOU'LL

01:55:29.722 --> 01:55:30.657
SEE IS.

01:55:30.723 --> 01:55:31.991
MONEY THAT'S BEING COMING DOWN

01:55:32.058 --> 01:55:32.959
THROUGH CAP AND TRADE FOR

01:55:33.026 --> 01:55:35.295
EXAMPLE FOR DAIRY GUY JESTERS --

01:55:35.361 --> 01:55:37.297
OR ORGANICS RECYCLING FACILITIES

01:55:37.363 --> 01:55:39.132
THAT KIND OF CAN HELP BALANCE

01:55:39.198 --> 01:55:41.067
THAT OUT AND BUT I DID WANT YOU

01:55:41.134 --> 01:55:42.535
TO KNOW THAT THAT THE MODEL THAT

01:55:42.602 --> 01:55:43.936
IS USED BY CARD ACTUALLY DOES

01:55:44.003 --> 01:55:44.937
GIVE --

01:55:45.004 --> 01:55:47.173
INCENTIVE TO PRODUCE AND STAYED

01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:49.909
THAT WAY THAT IS DESIGNED.

01:55:49.976 --> 01:55:51.411
BALLOT TACKLING O. TO STOCK IT

01:55:51.477 --> 01:55:53.212
WITH MUCH OF THE LEGISLATORS WE

01:55:53.279 --> 01:55:56.449
OUT FOR MORE AND STATE THAT'S AS

01:55:56.516 --> 01:55:57.450
OPPOSED.

01:55:57.517 --> 01:55:58.951
TO YOU KNOW IN THAT YEAR EITHER

01:55:59.018 --> 01:56:00.853
DOLLARS JUST AND WE ARE AND

01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:02.388
THAT'S OUT OF STATE YEAH.

01:56:02.455 --> 01:56:03.056
THAT'S WHY REFERENCE THE HELL IT

01:56:03.122 --> 01:56:05.758
WAS REALLY THAT CARP ASSESSMENT

01:56:05.825 --> 01:56:07.460
THAT I REFERENCE THAT LOOKS THAT.

01:56:07.527 --> 01:56:07.994
TWO THIRDS OF THE COST OF

01:56:08.061 --> 01:56:08.561
COMPLIANCE FLOWS OUT OF THE

01:56:08.628 --> 01:56:10.163
STATE BETWEEN TWENTY NINETEEN

01:56:10.229 --> 01:56:11.397
AND TWENTY THIRTY WHEN THAT IS A

01:56:11.464 --> 01:56:12.699
CARB ASSESSMENT SO I DO

01:56:12.765 --> 01:56:14.867
ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO

01:56:14.934 --> 01:56:16.636
REALLY LOOK INTO THAT BECAUSE

01:56:16.703 --> 01:56:17.704
THAT DOESN'T SOUND TO ME LIKE IT

01:56:17.770 --> 01:56:20.006
STAYS IN THE STATE.

01:56:20.073 --> 01:56:22.408
BUT THERE'S THERE'S BEEN A HUGE

01:56:22.475 --> 01:56:23.976
GROWTH IN THE BIODIESEL INDUSTRY

01:56:24.043 --> 01:56:26.145
IN PRODUCTION IN THE STATE AND

01:56:26.212 --> 01:56:27.313
SEVERAL EXPANSION PROJECTS

01:56:27.380 --> 01:56:29.048
SEVERAL PLANTS --

01:56:29.115 --> 01:56:32.151
HAVE DONE MORE THAN ONE

01:56:32.218 --> 01:56:33.553
EXPANSION PROJECT SO IT'S

01:56:33.619 --> 01:56:35.688
DEFINITELY GROWING OUR CAPACITY

01:56:35.755 --> 01:56:37.623
IS GROWING THERE'S PLANTS ARE

01:56:37.690 --> 01:56:38.891
BEING BUILT TODAY.

01:56:38.958 --> 01:56:39.792
PEERS PLANTS THAT ARE BEING

01:56:39.859 --> 01:56:42.195
PLANNED TODAY SO ARM AND THAT'S

01:56:42.261 --> 01:56:44.263
DRIVEN BY SOME CERTAINTY THAT'S

01:56:44.330 --> 01:56:45.732
CREATED BY LAMAR FEEL CENTER

01:56:45.798 --> 01:56:47.200
LOTS OF INVESTMENT --

01:56:47.266 --> 01:56:48.935
THERE'S A PLAN THAT WAS

01:56:49.001 --> 01:56:49.769
STRUGGLING WITH THE ITS

01:56:49.836 --> 01:56:51.838
OWNERSHIP AND COMPANY FROM OUT

01:56:51.904 --> 01:56:53.406
OF STATE CAME INTO CALIFORNIA

01:56:53.473 --> 01:56:54.807
AND PURCHASE THAT PLANT.

01:56:54.874 --> 01:56:56.275
AND IS BUILDING IT AND PLANNING

01:56:56.342 --> 01:56:58.211
TO EXPAND IT SO WELL AND THAT'S

01:56:58.277 --> 01:56:59.045
DRIVEN BY THE LOW CARB FEEL

01:56:59.112 --> 01:57:00.747
STANDARD AND YET THEY STARTED

01:57:00.813 --> 01:57:01.981
OUT BRINGING FUEL IN.

01:57:02.048 --> 01:57:03.683
BUT THEN THEY SAID HEY THIS IS A

01:57:03.750 --> 01:57:06.152
GREAT PROGRAM WE WANT. TO A PART

01:57:06.219 --> 01:57:06.652
OF IT THERE'S A THERE'S

01:57:06.719 --> 01:57:09.455
OPPORTUNITY.

01:57:09.522 --> 01:57:10.490
CREATE MORE JOBS ARE GOING TO

01:57:10.556 --> 01:57:11.557
CREATE MORE REVENUE MORE TAX

01:57:11.624 --> 01:57:15.027
REVENUE -- I

01:57:15.094 --> 01:57:16.496
MIGHT POINT OUT AND I THINK

01:57:16.562 --> 01:57:18.297
OTHERS MIGHT AGREE THAT. ONE OF

01:57:18.364 --> 01:57:19.432
THE DIFFICULTIES IS THE SEQUEL

01:57:19.499 --> 01:57:21.100
LAW IN CALIFORNIA IN GETTING

01:57:21.167 --> 01:57:22.869
PROJECTS OFF THE GROUND WE

01:57:22.935 --> 01:57:25.138
UNDERSTAND THAT --

01:57:25.204 --> 01:57:26.005
ASSEMBLY ARE FRUSTRATED FITS IT

01:57:26.072 --> 01:57:27.974
TAKES TWELVE YEARS TO BUILD A

01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:29.008
SUPER WALMART.

01:57:29.075 --> 01:57:30.309
WELL YOU KNOW IT'S IT WERE

01:57:30.376 --> 01:57:32.044
SUBJECT TO THAT AS WELL BUT YOU

01:57:32.111 --> 01:57:35.481
KNOW IT'S IT'S IT'S A HARM A

01:57:35.548 --> 01:57:37.183
TESTAMENT TO THE FACT THAT COME

01:57:37.250 --> 01:57:39.118
THERE ARE SO MANY PLANTS BEING

01:57:39.185 --> 01:57:40.653
BUILT IN HAVE BEEN BUILT AN ARM.

01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:42.221
PLAN TO BE BUILT.

01:57:42.288 --> 01:57:44.323
THAT THEY THEY CAN OVERCOME THAT

01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:45.792
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF

01:57:45.858 --> 01:57:47.727
INCENTIVE IT'S CREATED BY LOW

01:57:47.794 --> 01:57:48.261
CARB FEEL STANDARD CUT.

01:57:48.327 --> 01:57:49.662
LET ME ASK YOU A GENERAL

01:57:49.729 --> 01:57:53.065
QUESTION --

01:57:53.132 --> 01:57:54.600
FOR THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD

01:57:54.667 --> 01:57:55.968
DOES IT MATTER WHICH YOUR

01:57:56.035 --> 01:57:57.937
FEEDSTOCK IS SO YOU KNOW EARLIER

01:57:58.004 --> 01:57:59.605
IN TESTIMONY ADVENTURE AND YOU

01:57:59.672 --> 01:58:00.573
KNOW A COOKING GREASE FOR

01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:02.041
INSTANCE AND COMPARE THAT TO

01:58:02.108 --> 01:58:03.576
MAYBE ANIMAL FAT OR ANY OF THE

01:58:03.643 --> 01:58:05.077
OTHER.

01:58:05.144 --> 01:58:06.813
STOCK FEELS HOW DOES THAT AFFECT

01:58:06.879 --> 01:58:08.881
THE MAKE UP OF THE FUEL AND WHAT

01:58:08.948 --> 01:58:10.082
IT CAN BE USED [inaudible]

01:58:10.149 --> 01:58:12.051
FOR WELL.

01:58:12.118 --> 01:58:12.752
WEEKLY THERE'S WAYS OF

01:58:12.819 --> 01:58:14.353
PROCESSING THOSE DIFFERENT

01:58:14.420 --> 01:58:16.789
FEEDSTOCKS AND THE PLANTS.

01:58:16.856 --> 01:58:18.224
THAT PROCESS THOSE --

01:58:18.291 --> 01:58:19.492
FEEDSTOCK.

01:58:19.559 --> 01:58:21.227
OFTEN CALLED INTO BIODIESEL

01:58:21.294 --> 01:58:21.828
WORLD.

01:58:21.894 --> 01:58:23.129
A MULTI FEEDSTOCK PLAN AND THEY

01:58:23.196 --> 01:58:25.698
KNOW HOW TO PROCESS THEM ARE AND

01:58:25.765 --> 01:58:26.666
AND BRING THEM TO MARKET.

01:58:26.732 --> 01:58:28.367
SO WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THEM

01:58:28.434 --> 01:58:29.802
IS DATE CARBON INTENSITY AS

01:58:29.869 --> 01:58:32.104
DEFINED BY THE GREEK MODEL --

01:58:32.171 --> 01:58:34.874
AND SO --

01:58:34.941 --> 01:58:36.375
MOST OF THE PLANTS IN THE STATE

01:58:36.442 --> 01:58:37.844
USING USED COOKING ALL THEIR SEE

01:58:37.910 --> 01:58:39.412
I NUMBER THEIR CARBON INTENSITY

01:58:39.479 --> 01:58:40.913
NUMBER --

01:58:40.980 --> 01:58:42.482
WHICH IS THE OFFSET TO THAT

01:58:42.548 --> 01:58:45.117
ROUGHLY --

01:58:45.184 --> 01:58:46.786
HUNDRED A NUMBER THAT YOU SEE

01:58:46.853 --> 01:58:48.721
FOR FOR PETROLEUM DIESEL FUEL.

01:58:48.788 --> 01:58:50.456
HARPER.

01:58:50.523 --> 01:58:51.023
FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SO THAT'S

01:58:51.090 --> 01:58:53.259
ABOUT YOU KNOW WHEN 80% 85%

01:58:53.326 --> 01:58:54.694
REDUCTION AND THAT'S MOST THE

01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:56.596
PLANTS IN THE STATE.

01:58:56.662 --> 01:58:58.498
ARM SOME OF THEM USE OUR ANIMAL

01:58:58.564 --> 01:59:00.266
FATS WHICH ARE TYPICALLY MORE

01:59:00.333 --> 01:59:03.402
LIKE --

01:59:03.469 --> 01:59:04.003
THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY FIVE SOME

01:59:04.070 --> 01:59:06.138
USE QUORUM WITCHER THIRTY THE I

01:59:06.205 --> 01:59:09.642
MEAN SO THERE'S A VARIETY OF OF

01:59:09.709 --> 01:59:11.978
CAR C. EYES FOR THE DIFFERENT.

01:59:12.044 --> 01:59:13.112
OF FEEDSTOCKS.

01:59:13.179 --> 01:59:15.314
BUT AS FAR AS WHAT CAN BE USED

01:59:15.381 --> 01:59:17.416
FOR WHAT PURPOSE TYPICALLY THEY

01:59:17.483 --> 01:59:19.118
CAN ALL BE PROCESSED SO THAT

01:59:19.185 --> 01:59:20.620
THEIR THEY CAN BE BLENDED WITH

01:59:20.686 --> 01:59:22.555
HARM WITH THESE.

01:59:22.622 --> 01:59:23.890
CUT IT WOULD YOU NEED HIGHER

01:59:23.956 --> 01:59:24.991
PERCENTAGES MAYBE I GUESS FOR

01:59:25.057 --> 01:59:25.758
EVERYBODY WOULD YOU NEED A

01:59:25.825 --> 01:59:27.560
HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF THAT PLAN

01:59:27.627 --> 01:59:30.162
TO EQUAL THE SAME AMOUNT OF AN

01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:32.131
OF THE MEGA JOULES LIKE ASSEMBLY

01:59:32.198 --> 01:59:33.432
HAD PENSION EARLY ON FROM MEMBER

01:59:33.499 --> 01:59:34.467
FIZZY.

01:59:34.534 --> 01:59:36.002
LA OVER SOMEONE ON THIS PANEL.

01:59:36.068 --> 01:59:36.602
AB BECAUSE OF TRYING TO FIGURE

01:59:36.669 --> 01:59:38.371
OUT BECAUSE QUESTION I GET A LOT

01:59:38.437 --> 01:59:40.439
BACK HOME IS YOU KNOW HE WON A

01:59:40.506 --> 01:59:40.940
MOVE TO THESE RENEWABLE

01:59:41.007 --> 01:59:43.543
STANDARDS AND BUT THE QUESTION I

01:59:43.609 --> 01:59:45.077
GET FROM MY FRIENDS INSIDE THE

01:59:45.144 --> 01:59:46.879
TRUCK DRIVERS BACK ON PEOPLE

01:59:46.946 --> 01:59:48.748
THAT OWN TRUCKING FLEET.

01:59:48.814 --> 01:59:50.683
IS THERE ASKING OKAY WHERE YOU

01:59:50.750 --> 01:59:52.852
ONCE TO BLAND ACTS AMOUNT AND IN

01:59:52.919 --> 01:59:54.320
THE FUTURE YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA

01:59:54.387 --> 01:59:55.788
ASK FOR MORE.

01:59:55.855 --> 01:59:56.789
BUT AT WHAT POINT DOES THAT

01:59:56.856 --> 01:59:59.025
START AFFECTING MY EFFICIENCY OF

01:59:59.091 --> 02:00:00.893
MY ENGINES.

02:00:00.960 --> 02:00:02.862
AND IS GOING TO COST ME MORE IN

02:00:02.929 --> 02:00:05.031
TERMS OF FILLING UP MORE.

02:00:05.097 --> 02:00:07.099
AS OPPOSED TO USING A BASE

02:00:07.166 --> 02:00:09.702
DIESEL SO WITH BIODIESEL THERE'S

02:00:09.769 --> 02:00:11.771
A VERY SLIGHT INCREMENTAL LA

02:00:11.837 --> 02:00:14.774
DECREASE IT'S ABOUT. 324% AND ON

02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:17.510
AND THAT AND ON A 20% BLEND.

02:00:17.577 --> 02:00:19.779
IT'S I WOULD SAY DE MINIMUS AND

02:00:19.845 --> 02:00:20.980
MORE HAS TO DO WITH HOW HEAVY

02:00:21.047 --> 02:00:22.815
THE FOOT OF THE DRIVER IS AND

02:00:22.882 --> 02:00:25.051
THEN THE ENERGY VALUE IN THE

02:00:25.117 --> 02:00:26.152
FUEL -- BUT

02:00:26.218 --> 02:00:29.555
YOU KNOW IF YOU [inaudible]

02:00:29.622 --> 02:00:33.192
NUMEROUS STOPPED NOW THAT SAY.

02:00:33.259 --> 02:00:35.494
A B. TWENTY BODIES MAY CONTAIN

02:00:35.561 --> 02:00:37.363
UP 220% BODIES ALSO MORE AND

02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:38.464
MORE TRUCK STOPS ARE DOING

02:00:38.531 --> 02:00:40.466
THAT'S WHY BECAUSE THERE'S VALUE

02:00:40.533 --> 02:00:42.335
IN IT FOR THEM.

02:00:42.401 --> 02:00:44.570
COM AND AND IT'S AS SIMPLE AS

02:00:44.637 --> 02:00:46.706
THAT ENTRY SO MORE MORE TRUCK

02:00:46.772 --> 02:00:47.340
DRIVERS.

02:00:47.406 --> 02:00:49.408
ART ARE UTILIZING IT MORE OF THE

02:00:49.475 --> 02:00:52.111
OEMS THE TRUCK MANUFACTURERS ARE

02:00:52.178 --> 02:00:53.245
ALLOWING HIGHER BLENDS NOW

02:00:53.312 --> 02:00:54.814
BIODIESEL IN FACT MOST OF THE

02:00:54.880 --> 02:00:57.183
HEAVY DUTY OEMS ALLOW 20%

02:00:57.249 --> 02:00:58.484
PLANNED.

02:00:58.551 --> 02:01:00.920
SO IT THIS IS SORT OF HAPPENING

02:01:00.987 --> 02:01:02.355
BE SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS ABOUT

02:01:02.421 --> 02:01:03.923
THIS I REMEMBER WHEN I USED TO

02:01:03.990 --> 02:01:05.658
TRY TO MARKET TO FLEETS IN THE

02:01:05.725 --> 02:01:07.660
CENTRAL VALLEY THE FARMS LEADS.

02:01:07.727 --> 02:01:08.694
DIDN'T WANNA USE BY IDEAS THEY

02:01:08.761 --> 02:01:11.397
DIDN'T WANT TO USE 5% OR EVEN 2%

02:01:11.464 --> 02:01:11.964
THEY WERE SCARED OF IT THEY

02:01:12.031 --> 02:01:13.099
THOUGHT IT WOULD.

02:01:13.165 --> 02:01:14.266
YOU KNOW THEIR HEADLIGHTS WOULD

02:01:14.333 --> 02:01:15.701
GO OUT AND ALL MANNER OF THINGS

02:01:15.768 --> 02:01:16.736
WOULD HAPPEN.

02:01:16.802 --> 02:01:17.803
EXCEPT YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT

02:01:17.870 --> 02:01:19.105
THE ACT COMMUNITIES IN THE

02:01:19.171 --> 02:01:21.340
MIDWEST WHERE THEY GROW SOYBEANS

02:01:21.407 --> 02:01:22.675
THEY ADOPTED OF MUCH QUICKER

02:01:22.742 --> 02:01:23.943
BECAUSE THEY WERE GROWING THE

02:01:24.010 --> 02:01:25.344
FEED STOCKS AND THEY WERE

02:01:25.411 --> 02:01:26.846
ACTUALLY MAKING MONEY FROM IT.

02:01:26.912 --> 02:01:28.714
AND LO AND BEHOLD IT NO LONGER

02:01:28.781 --> 02:01:30.049
BECAME THREATENING WHEN THEY

02:01:30.116 --> 02:01:31.450
REALIZE WHAT WE ACTUAR MAKING

02:01:31.517 --> 02:01:32.418
MONEY OFF THIS.

02:01:32.485 --> 02:01:33.986
THERE ARE PROGRAMS UP HERE IN

02:01:34.053 --> 02:01:35.421
THE STATE TO TRY TO DEVELOP IN

02:01:35.488 --> 02:01:37.289
STATE FEET STOCKS AS WELL

02:01:37.356 --> 02:01:40.192
PURPOSE GROWN ENERGY CROPS --

02:01:40.259 --> 02:01:42.962
A STEVE KAFKA WITH A UC DAVIS HE

02:01:43.029 --> 02:01:44.897
RUNS THE BIO ENERGY --

02:01:44.964 --> 02:01:46.699
UP PROGRAM THERE AND HE'S DONE

02:01:46.766 --> 02:01:48.901
SOME TREMENDOUS WORK IN AND

02:01:48.968 --> 02:01:50.569
DEVELOPING IN STATE PURPOSE

02:01:50.636 --> 02:01:51.037
GROUND FEEDSTOCK FROM

02:01:51.103 --> 02:01:52.104
BATTLEFIELDS [inaudible]

02:01:52.171 --> 02:01:53.973
CUT NO.

02:01:54.040 --> 02:01:56.308
WITH WITH THAT I I THINK.

02:01:56.375 --> 02:01:57.677
BUT ONE I WANT TO KNOW HOW THE

02:01:57.743 --> 02:01:59.545
PROJECT IN MY DISTRICT GOING

02:01:59.612 --> 02:02:02.248
WITH THE DAIRY --

02:02:02.314 --> 02:02:04.283
MOVING OVER BECAUSE ARCHIE GUYS

02:02:04.350 --> 02:02:08.020
USING SOME OF THE AND WASTE FROM

02:02:08.087 --> 02:02:10.756
THE DAIRY LEGUMES INTO BILE

02:02:10.823 --> 02:02:12.024
DIESEL ISN'T THAT PART OF WHAT

02:02:12.091 --> 02:02:12.825
YOU GUYS ARE DOING.

02:02:12.892 --> 02:02:14.326
THAT SO THAT IS PART OF THE

02:02:14.393 --> 02:02:15.728
PROJECT IS A VERY INTEGRATED

02:02:15.795 --> 02:02:18.297
PROJECT IT'S ELEVEN DAIRIES THAT --

02:02:18.364 --> 02:02:20.199
WERE DIE GESTURES ARE BEING PUT

02:02:20.266 --> 02:02:22.034
IT INSTALLED ON THOSE AREAS AND

02:02:22.101 --> 02:02:24.270
THEN A PIPELINE INTO --

02:02:24.336 --> 02:02:26.672
INTO THE PLANT IN PIXLEY AND IT

02:02:26.739 --> 02:02:28.074
WILL GO --

02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:29.341
ONE OF THREE WAYS MIDDLE IT'LL

02:02:29.408 --> 02:02:30.843
BE A FUEL SOURCE OF FOR

02:02:30.910 --> 02:02:32.511
PRODUCING THE ETHANOL AND

02:02:32.578 --> 02:02:33.979
BIODIESEL PLANT THAT THEY'RE

02:02:34.046 --> 02:02:34.613
THEY'RE NOW BUILDING THERE AS

02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:37.083
WELL -- AND

02:02:37.149 --> 02:02:39.485
THERE ALSO [inaudible]

02:02:39.552 --> 02:02:42.288
A GAS IMPRESSING STATIONS SO

02:02:42.354 --> 02:02:44.090
DEPENDING ON THE ECONOMICS AND

02:02:44.156 --> 02:02:46.792
THE DIVERSIFICATION AND WHAT THE

02:02:46.859 --> 02:02:48.494
THE MARKETS ARE OPPORTUNITIES

02:02:48.561 --> 02:02:50.596
ARE IT'LL EITHER GOING TO THE

02:02:50.663 --> 02:02:52.364
PRODUCTION OF BIODIESEL --

02:02:52.431 --> 02:02:53.165
INTO --

02:02:53.232 --> 02:02:54.834
ETHANOL OR RENEW PANACHE GAS OF

02:02:54.900 --> 02:02:56.669
REALLY SHOWING HOW ALL THREE OF

02:02:56.736 --> 02:02:58.738
THESE THINGS ACTUALLY CAN CO

02:02:58.804 --> 02:03:00.973
EXIST ON THE ON THE SAME LEADERS

02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:02.108
RUN AWAY WHERE WORD DAIRY IS

02:03:02.174 --> 02:03:03.976
ABLE.

02:03:04.043 --> 02:03:06.345
TO SELL THE WAYS.

02:03:06.412 --> 02:03:09.482
IN IN MEET THEIR STANDARD MATH

02:03:09.548 --> 02:03:10.216
II STANDARDS YEAH.

02:03:10.282 --> 02:03:12.485
WHO SO SO THEY'RE PROTECTED ON

02:03:12.551 --> 02:03:14.153
THE DAIRY JI YES YOUR SIDE?

02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:14.820
WHICH SOLVE THAT ISSUE FOR DAIRY

02:03:14.887 --> 02:03:17.690
WHICH IS HUGE HUGE AND THEN

02:03:17.757 --> 02:03:19.625
CREATING BIODIESEL.

02:03:19.692 --> 02:03:21.026
CHILDREN LOWER THE COST OF

02:03:21.093 --> 02:03:24.997
DIESEL FOR EVERYBODY.

02:03:25.064 --> 02:03:25.998
AND OUR FINAL HEADED LOWER THAN

02:03:26.065 --> 02:03:27.967
ASSN ALL AND CAPTURING NATURAL

02:03:28.033 --> 02:03:29.168
NATURAL GAS RIGHT.

02:03:29.235 --> 02:03:30.603
AND THEN --

02:03:30.669 --> 02:03:31.837
WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING IN THE

02:03:31.904 --> 02:03:34.540
SO WHY HASN'T CALIFORNIA.

02:03:34.607 --> 02:03:36.675
PAVE THE WAY FOR SEQUEL REFORM

02:03:36.742 --> 02:03:38.177
FOR YOU GUYS YEAH IF IT GOOD

02:03:38.244 --> 02:03:39.945
QUESTION BUT THE THE OTHER DAY

02:03:40.012 --> 02:03:41.347
COMPLETE THAT LIVE BECAUSE THIS

02:03:41.413 --> 02:03:42.748
PROJECT IS SUCH AN AMAZING

02:03:42.815 --> 02:03:44.583
PROJECT --

02:03:44.650 --> 02:03:47.019
IT'S WHEN WE CONVERT THE STARCH

02:03:47.086 --> 02:03:49.488
IN THE CORN TO ETHANOL.

02:03:49.555 --> 02:03:52.057
ALL OF DAY THE REAL FEED VALUE

02:03:52.124 --> 02:03:53.793
IS CONCENTRATE IN WHAT WE CALL

02:03:53.859 --> 02:03:55.561
DISTILLERS GRAINS --

02:03:55.628 --> 02:03:56.462
AND THAT GOES BACK TO THE

02:03:56.529 --> 02:03:59.999
DAIRIES. TO TO FEED THE ANIMALS.

02:04:00.065 --> 02:04:02.168
TO THEN PRODUCE.

02:04:02.234 --> 02:04:04.003
HASN'T THERE BYPRODUCT MILLER

02:04:04.069 --> 02:04:06.038
MANEUVER THAT COMES BACK TO US

02:04:06.105 --> 02:04:06.939
TO POWER THE PROCESS OF THEIRS

02:04:07.006 --> 02:04:08.774
IS REALLY PERPETUAL MOTION

02:04:08.841 --> 02:04:10.376
MACHINE IS BEING CREATED WHICH

02:04:10.442 --> 02:04:11.177
THE ECONOMICS OF THAT

02:04:11.243 --> 02:04:12.578
OUTSTANDING IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL

02:04:12.645 --> 02:04:14.079
PERFORMANCE OF THAT IS.

02:04:14.146 --> 02:04:17.616
IT'S QUITE EXEMPLARY

02:04:17.683 --> 02:04:17.917
[inaudible]

02:04:17.983 --> 02:04:19.618
GOT IT.

02:04:19.685 --> 02:04:21.387
YEAH I'M JUST MAKING SURE THEY

02:04:21.453 --> 02:04:24.056
GET THE CREDITS FOR NONE OF

02:04:24.123 --> 02:04:24.623
LEADER CAUCUS WILL HELP WITH

02:04:24.690 --> 02:04:26.926
THAT.

02:04:26.992 --> 02:04:28.694
LIBYA FOLLOW UP ON THE QUESTION

02:04:28.761 --> 02:04:29.995
I WAS ASKING DIESEL BUT I DON'T

02:04:30.062 --> 02:04:31.864
KNOW MAYBE. THREE SPOILED

02:04:31.931 --> 02:04:35.067
DEFERRED GASOLINE --

02:04:35.134 --> 02:04:37.570
VIDEO AND IT'S MIXED BECAUSE

02:04:37.636 --> 02:04:38.971
THERE YOU GO TO CERTAIN GAS

02:04:39.038 --> 02:04:40.539
STATIONS AND IT'S MIXED WITH

02:04:40.606 --> 02:04:42.975
ETHANOL FOR INSTANCE TO ADD TO

02:04:43.042 --> 02:04:44.810
LOWER THE CARBON INTENSITY BUT

02:04:44.877 --> 02:04:46.879
DOES THAT FUEL STILL HAVE THE

02:04:46.946 --> 02:04:48.314
SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY.

02:04:48.380 --> 02:04:49.348
BECAUSE I MEAN THAT'S WHY I WAS

02:04:49.415 --> 02:04:50.683
ASKING ABOUT COULD HEAR ABOUT IT

02:04:50.749 --> 02:04:51.750
FROM THE TRUCKERS [inaudible]

02:04:51.817 --> 02:04:53.752
NON OF REGULAR GAS POWERED

02:04:53.819 --> 02:04:56.355
VEHICLES NOT I AND I I THINK

02:04:56.422 --> 02:04:58.657
WHAT'S ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT AS

02:04:58.724 --> 02:04:59.291
YOU KNOW.

02:04:59.358 --> 02:05:02.194
WE OBVIOUSLY PLANNED UP 210%

02:05:02.261 --> 02:05:04.096
ETHANOL CURRENTLY.

02:05:04.163 --> 02:05:05.130
BEFORE THE LOW CARBON FUEL

02:05:05.197 --> 02:05:06.398
STANDARD WE COULD BURN I MEAN WE

02:05:06.465 --> 02:05:08.400
COULD BLEND UP 10% ETHANOL IT'S

02:05:08.467 --> 02:05:09.935
AS WE ALL KNOW IT'S THE TYPE.

02:05:10.002 --> 02:05:11.237
OF ETHANOL IN THE CARBON

02:05:11.303 --> 02:05:13.005
INTENSITY THAT BECOMES THE

02:05:13.072 --> 02:05:14.707
IMPORTANT PIECE OF THAT.

02:05:14.773 --> 02:05:17.309
OF THAT DISCUSSION AND EVEN AS

02:05:17.376 --> 02:05:20.012
WE PHAM AS WHEN WE WILL ALWAYS

02:05:20.079 --> 02:05:21.146
COMPLY WITH THIS RIGHT RIGHT

02:05:21.213 --> 02:05:22.047
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DO WE

02:05:22.114 --> 02:05:23.582
COMPLY.

02:05:23.649 --> 02:05:25.351
THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT.

02:05:25.417 --> 02:05:28.320
COMPLIANCE WON'T INCREASE COSTS

02:05:28.387 --> 02:05:29.889
TO THE THE TWO PEOPLE THAT ARE

02:05:29.955 --> 02:05:31.390
ARE THE TWO GROUPS THAT HAVE.

02:05:31.457 --> 02:05:32.625
CONTINUED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT

02:05:32.691 --> 02:05:34.026
THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD

02:05:34.093 --> 02:05:35.694
WITCHES ECONOMISTS.

02:05:35.761 --> 02:05:37.763
WHO CARE ABOUT COST?

02:05:37.830 --> 02:05:39.198
AND CONSUMERS WHO CARE ABOUT

02:05:39.265 --> 02:05:41.267
COST.

02:05:41.333 --> 02:05:43.802
SO AGAIN AS WE BEGIN TO TALK

02:05:43.869 --> 02:05:45.971
ABOUT HOW WE AS REFINERS

02:05:46.038 --> 02:05:48.540
CONTINUE TO MEET THE OBLIGATION.

02:05:48.607 --> 02:05:51.577
OF CARBON INTENSITY AT THAT 10% --

02:05:51.644 --> 02:05:53.913
AT THE 10% LEVEL --

02:05:53.979 --> 02:05:55.381
IT BECOMES IT IT'S AN

02:05:55.447 --> 02:05:57.516
INTERESTING PROGRAM BECAUSE YOU

02:05:57.583 --> 02:05:59.952
ARE OBVIOUSLY IF YOU.

02:06:00.019 --> 02:06:02.621
BLEND INTO OUR FUEL TO MEET YOUR

02:06:02.688 --> 02:06:04.623
COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS THAT YOUR

02:06:04.690 --> 02:06:06.292
BEST AVENUE UNTIL NOTHING'S

02:06:06.358 --> 02:06:08.460
AVAILABLE TO MEET THOSE CI

02:06:08.527 --> 02:06:09.929
TARGETS AND WERE ONLY AT THREE

02:06:09.995 --> 02:06:11.096
POINT 5%.

02:06:11.163 --> 02:06:13.032
AND SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THAT'S

02:06:13.098 --> 02:06:15.034
NOT AVAILABLE OR YOU DON'T HAVE

02:06:15.100 --> 02:06:17.102
THOSE CARBON INTENSITIES IS YOU

02:06:17.169 --> 02:06:17.970
HAVE TO GO TO THE CREDIT MARKET

02:06:18.037 --> 02:06:19.471
TO COMPLY.

02:06:19.538 --> 02:06:20.839
WHICH WE WILL.

02:06:20.906 --> 02:06:22.474
THEREFORE THE HUNDRED FORTY NINE

02:06:22.541 --> 02:06:24.176
DOLLARS KICK SAND IN ALL THOSE

02:06:24.243 --> 02:06:25.644
COST COMPONENT STARTED.

02:06:25.711 --> 02:06:27.613
SO ARE YOU SAYING RIGHT NOW THE

02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:29.882
ONLY WAY YOU CAN MEET THE LCF.

02:06:29.949 --> 02:06:31.784
AS BY BLENDING WELL I DON'T HAVE

02:06:31.850 --> 02:06:33.285
THE LOWER AT THE LOWER SEE AT

02:06:33.352 --> 02:06:34.520
THE LOWER PERCENTAGES RIGHT

02:06:34.586 --> 02:06:35.854
BECAUSE WHAT LOW.

02:06:35.921 --> 02:06:38.023
PERCENTAGES RIGHT NOW IN THE

02:06:38.090 --> 02:06:39.224
CARBON INTENSITY THREE POINT 5%

02:06:39.291 --> 02:06:42.461
NOT 10% NOT 18% RIGHT SO WHERE

02:06:42.528 --> 02:06:43.595
THE LOWER LEVELS OF THE PROGRAM.

02:06:43.662 --> 02:06:45.264
SO YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH IN THE

02:06:45.331 --> 02:06:46.799
EARLY STAGES YOU WERE ABLE TO

02:06:46.865 --> 02:06:48.667
DEVELOP CREDITS BECAUSE YOU WERE

02:06:48.734 --> 02:06:50.002
ABLE TO MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS

02:06:50.069 --> 02:06:51.870
AS THESE AS THESE PERCENTAGES

02:06:51.937 --> 02:06:53.939
INCREASE WHICH THEY WILL AS WE

02:06:54.006 --> 02:06:55.607
KNOW GETS THE BIKE PATH.

02:06:55.674 --> 02:06:57.209
THEN THAT'S WHERE SOME OF THE

02:06:57.276 --> 02:06:57.743
BEST FOR THE CRUNCH STARTS

02:06:57.810 --> 02:06:58.677
COMING IN.

02:06:58.744 --> 02:06:59.845
FROM FROM WHAT'S AVAILABLE AND

02:06:59.912 --> 02:07:02.281
THE COST.

02:07:02.348 --> 02:07:03.749
GOTTEN SO READ OUR THEORY AND

02:07:03.816 --> 02:07:05.184
THIS IS I THINK YOU REFERRED TO

02:07:05.250 --> 02:07:05.884
IT EARLIER THAT.

02:07:05.951 --> 02:07:08.120
AIR BE REDUCED.

02:07:08.187 --> 02:07:10.322
THE GOAL FOR TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT

02:07:10.389 --> 02:07:11.256
FROM THE THREE POINT FIVE NOW

02:07:11.323 --> 02:07:12.391
WE'RE GONNA GO TO SOME POINT

02:07:12.458 --> 02:07:14.626
FIVE AS OPPOSED 210% AND IT'S

02:07:14.693 --> 02:07:17.529
IT'S BACK LOADING AGAIN RIGHT.

02:07:17.596 --> 02:07:19.031
IF IF I GATHERED THERE'S NO

02:07:19.098 --> 02:07:20.132
QUESTION THAT THE YOU KNOW THE

02:07:20.199 --> 02:07:22.267
TARGETS ARE AMBITIOUS AND THAT'S

02:07:22.334 --> 02:07:22.534
WHY -- YOU

02:07:22.601 --> 02:07:24.370
KNOW WORKING WITH THE IT WAS THE

02:07:24.436 --> 02:07:26.005
MEMBER COMPANIES IN.

02:07:26.071 --> 02:07:26.972
AND OTHER --

02:07:27.039 --> 02:07:28.540
LIQUID FUEL PROVIDERS YOU KNOW

02:07:28.607 --> 02:07:30.542
THAT IS THE THE MOST DOMINANT

02:07:30.609 --> 02:07:31.744
FUEL AND WILL BE FOR QUITE SOME

02:07:31.810 --> 02:07:35.781
TIME AND WHAT WE DO TO CONTINUE --

02:07:35.848 --> 02:07:36.882
TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE AND

02:07:36.949 --> 02:07:38.584
DRIVE DOWN THE CARBON INTENSITY

02:07:38.650 --> 02:07:42.054
OF LIQUID FUELS AT AFFORDABLE

02:07:42.121 --> 02:07:43.288
COST AND THAT'S WHERE WE THINK

02:07:43.355 --> 02:07:45.124
THAT THE OPTION TO DUBLIN MORE

02:07:45.190 --> 02:07:46.325
BY FEELS.

02:07:46.392 --> 02:07:48.260
ON THE IS.

02:07:48.327 --> 02:07:49.862
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE

02:07:49.928 --> 02:07:51.797
TODAY AND IT'S FALLING BUT OUR

02:07:51.864 --> 02:07:54.233
ETHANOL ON AVERAGE.

02:07:54.299 --> 02:07:56.201
IT'S 30% LASSEN GHASTLY SO

02:07:56.268 --> 02:07:57.970
THEORETICALLY IF OF THE LIQUID

02:07:58.037 --> 02:07:59.638
FUEL IS A HUNDRED SAN GASOLINE A

02:07:59.705 --> 02:08:01.440
CARPET GO 230% REDUCTION.

02:08:01.507 --> 02:08:03.675
WE'D BE THERE AND WITH WITH

02:08:03.742 --> 02:08:04.343
ETHANOL THE LOWER PRICING

02:08:04.410 --> 02:08:06.445
GHASTLY WE'RE NOT PROPOSING THAT

02:08:06.512 --> 02:08:08.547
WE'RE PROPOSING. TO TO GRADUALLY

02:08:08.614 --> 02:08:10.082
INCREASE THE PLANS TO TAKE FULL

02:08:10.149 --> 02:08:12.051
ADVANTAGE OF THE FUEL PROPERTIES

02:08:12.117 --> 02:08:13.419
OF ETHANOL NOT ONLY CARBON

02:08:13.485 --> 02:08:15.687
INTENSITY BUT AKANE SO TO IN

02:08:15.754 --> 02:08:17.389
RESPONSE YOUR QUESTION.

02:08:17.456 --> 02:08:19.725
ON IS THE THE ENERGY

02:08:19.792 --> 02:08:20.025
[inaudible]

02:08:20.092 --> 02:08:22.127
DOES HAVE PER UNIT BALLING

02:08:22.194 --> 02:08:22.428
[inaudible]

02:08:22.494 --> 02:08:24.196
VERY GOOD.

02:08:24.263 --> 02:08:26.665
ASPECT OF GASOLINE IS IT'S IT'S

02:08:26.732 --> 02:08:28.000
VERY DANCE ENERGY --

02:08:28.067 --> 02:08:30.035
ETHANOL'S ENERGY DENSITY PER

02:08:30.102 --> 02:08:33.205
UNIT VOLUME PER GALLON IS ABOUT

02:08:33.272 --> 02:08:35.340
30% LESS IN GASOLINE BUT IT'S

02:08:35.407 --> 02:08:37.509
OCTANE IS A HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN

02:08:37.576 --> 02:08:39.344
SO IF YOU OPTIMIZE AROUND THE

02:08:39.411 --> 02:08:40.679
OCTANE OF ETHANOL.

02:08:40.746 --> 02:08:41.947
WHICH IS WHAT THE THE NEW

02:08:42.014 --> 02:08:43.515
GENERATION OF ENGINES WILL DO

02:08:43.582 --> 02:08:45.017
OUGHT TO RUN ON HIGHER OCTANE

02:08:45.084 --> 02:08:47.686
FUELS YOU YOU TAKE THAT THAT

02:08:47.753 --> 02:08:49.288
LOSS OF ENERGY DENSITY.

02:08:49.354 --> 02:08:51.323
AND YOU MORE THAN GAIN IT BACK

02:08:51.390 --> 02:08:52.691
THROUGH HIGHER PERFORMANCE

02:08:52.758 --> 02:08:53.992
BECAUSE OF THE OCTANE SO THAT'S

02:08:54.059 --> 02:08:55.828
THAT THE OPPORTUNITY AND WHY

02:08:55.894 --> 02:08:57.463
HIGHER BLENDS ARE REALLY A SWEET

02:08:57.529 --> 02:08:58.730
SPOT KNOWN ONLY FROM.

02:08:58.797 --> 02:09:00.432
A AYE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE

02:09:00.499 --> 02:09:02.901
BUT FROM A HIGH PERFORMANCE OF

02:09:02.968 --> 02:09:04.636
OF AN ENGINE WHERE YOU CAN MORE

02:09:04.703 --> 02:09:05.771
THAN OFFSET.

02:09:05.838 --> 02:09:07.106
THE AT THE END RIGHT ANY CAR

02:09:07.172 --> 02:09:07.973
EARLY FAMILIES ARE MORE

02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:10.309
CONCERNED ABOUT MILES PER GALLON

02:09:10.375 --> 02:09:11.510
VERSES --

02:09:11.577 --> 02:09:13.312
OCTANE WILL A BUT THAT'S THE

02:09:13.378 --> 02:09:14.646
POINT IS I TOTALLY AGREE WITH

02:09:14.713 --> 02:09:17.049
YOU IF YOU HAVE AN ENGINE THAT --

02:09:17.116 --> 02:09:18.951
RUNS ON A HIGHER OCTANE FUEL YOU

02:09:19.017 --> 02:09:20.652
GET MORE MILES PER GALLON SO YOU

02:09:20.719 --> 02:09:21.987
CAN TAKE A HIGHER LEVEL OF

02:09:22.054 --> 02:09:23.655
ABSENT WANTED TO MAKE SURE YOU

02:09:23.722 --> 02:09:25.057
WENT THERE TO THE MILE YEAH GALA

02:09:25.124 --> 02:09:25.691
MILES PER GALLON.

02:09:25.757 --> 02:09:28.060
AND OCTANE ROSBERG ALLEN IS WHAT

02:09:28.127 --> 02:09:29.828
COUNTS YEAH EVERYBODY'S GOING

02:09:29.895 --> 02:09:32.364
OKAY THE THE COST IS GOING UP

02:09:32.431 --> 02:09:35.167
BUT IF I CAN'T DRIVE AS FAR

02:09:35.234 --> 02:09:35.467
[inaudible]

02:09:35.534 --> 02:09:37.269
THEN.

02:09:37.336 --> 02:09:38.904
WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MATTER

02:09:38.971 --> 02:09:39.538
WILL NOT SEE IT REYES OF RECALL

02:09:39.605 --> 02:09:41.473
YOU'LL GOING UP A LITTLE BIT BUT

02:09:41.540 --> 02:09:42.975
I CAN DRIVE FARTHER?

02:09:43.041 --> 02:09:45.644
THEN THERE'S A BALANCE.

02:09:45.711 --> 02:09:46.945
THOSE ARE ANY ENGINES RIGHT NOW

02:09:47.012 --> 02:09:48.013
THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING USED

02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:50.015
WITH THE HIGHER OCTANE.

02:09:50.082 --> 02:09:52.117
BUT THERE ARE A ENGINES AND

02:09:52.184 --> 02:09:53.252
DEVELOPMENT THERE ARE --

02:09:53.318 --> 02:09:56.488
CARS IT'S A MUCH USE PREMIUM SO --

02:09:56.555 --> 02:09:58.557
TURBOCHARGING IS IS WHICH MOST

02:09:58.624 --> 02:10:00.325
NEW CARS HAVE IS ACTUALLY TAKING

02:10:00.392 --> 02:10:01.693
ADVANTAGE OF THAT --

02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:03.295
THAT OCTANE --

02:10:03.362 --> 02:10:05.597
YOU CAN THERE'S ABOUT AND OVER A

02:10:05.664 --> 02:10:06.999
MILLION CARS IN CALIFORNIA THAT

02:10:07.065 --> 02:10:08.767
CAN RUN 85% ETHANOL.

02:10:08.834 --> 02:10:11.270
AND YOU CAN BUY THAT FUEL ATTA

02:10:11.336 --> 02:10:12.070
SEVENTY FIVE CENTS PER GALLON

02:10:12.137 --> 02:10:13.505
LISTEN GASOLINE TODAY RIGHT HERE

02:10:13.572 --> 02:10:16.308
IN SACRAMENTO [inaudible]

02:10:16.375 --> 02:10:18.377
OKAY.

02:10:18.443 --> 02:10:20.345
I HAVE A LIST OF MORE QUESTIONS

02:10:20.412 --> 02:10:23.315
WE HAVE ANOTHER PANEL.

02:10:23.382 --> 02:10:24.650
LET ME JUST ASK THERE'S ANY

02:10:24.716 --> 02:10:26.185
ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS.

02:10:26.251 --> 02:10:27.853
JUST AND AS THESE THINGS DEVELOP

02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:29.521
ABOVE THE TOP OF THE TWENTY OH

02:10:29.588 --> 02:10:31.990
SPECIAL YOU TILL --

02:10:32.057 --> 02:10:33.792
AS AS THINGS GO FOR ESPECIALLY

02:10:33.859 --> 02:10:35.594
AS WE GET INTO LOOKING AT

02:10:35.661 --> 02:10:37.095
LEGISLATION FOR NEXT CYCLE.

02:10:37.162 --> 02:10:40.132
ON WAYS THAT --

02:10:40.199 --> 02:10:41.967
WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO COME TO

02:10:42.034 --> 02:10:43.135
SOLVE SOME OF THESE THINGS AND

02:10:43.202 --> 02:10:44.937
DEAL WITH SOME OF THE STUFF IN.

02:10:45.003 --> 02:10:46.471
HOPEFULLY MOVE THE BALL ON SOME

02:10:46.538 --> 02:10:49.975
III OUR SECRET STUFF IS A WHILE --

02:10:50.042 --> 02:10:52.110
MY FEELING IS IF AS A ST WERE

02:10:52.177 --> 02:10:54.012
GOING TO AYE BASICALLY MANDATE

02:10:54.079 --> 02:10:55.314
THIS WE NEED.

02:10:55.380 --> 02:10:56.381
TO DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER IS

02:10:56.448 --> 02:10:58.116
A STATE TO EXPEDITE IT MAKE IT

02:10:58.183 --> 02:10:58.417
[inaudible]

02:10:58.483 --> 02:11:00.185
COST.

02:11:00.252 --> 02:11:02.354
FROM THE FOR OUR PEOPLE.

02:11:02.421 --> 02:11:03.789
CORRECT YEAH I THINK THAT'S ONE

02:11:03.855 --> 02:11:04.923
OF THE THINGS WE HEAR ABOUT BACK

02:11:04.990 --> 02:11:05.891
IN OUR DISTRICTS AS A COST

02:11:05.958 --> 02:11:07.426
CONTAINMENT AND WHAT ELSE MAINLY

02:11:07.492 --> 02:11:08.694
MEANS TO EACH CONSUMER

02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:08.994
[inaudible]

02:11:09.061 --> 02:11:11.763
AS AS A DRIVING THEIR VEHICLES

02:11:11.830 --> 02:11:13.632
AND YOU KNOW THERE'S POLICIES

02:11:13.699 --> 02:11:15.100
THAT THAT HAVE BEEN PUSH FORWARD

02:11:15.167 --> 02:11:17.202
AND AND THE STATE TO START

02:11:17.269 --> 02:11:18.837
MOVING TOWARDS NEAR.

02:11:18.904 --> 02:11:20.872
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES OR ZERO

02:11:20.939 --> 02:11:22.941
EMISSION VEHICLES BUT NO I THINK

02:11:23.008 --> 02:11:24.810
WE'RE A LONG WAY FROM BEING

02:11:24.876 --> 02:11:25.944
THERE --

02:11:26.011 --> 02:11:27.179
UNDER PERCENT SPACE AUTHORED A

02:11:27.246 --> 02:11:28.313
BAND OF CALIFORNIANS AND MEETING

02:11:28.380 --> 02:11:30.249
IN STATE PRODUCTION.

02:11:30.315 --> 02:11:31.516
AS WE DO THAT AND SO ONE OF

02:11:31.583 --> 02:11:32.351
THINGS THAT WE NEED TO BE

02:11:32.417 --> 02:11:33.685
MINDFUL OF THIS WHAT IS THE COST

02:11:33.752 --> 02:11:34.653
CONTAINMENT.

02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:36.655
I FOR THAT AS AS THE STATE

02:11:36.722 --> 02:11:37.489
CONTINUES TO MOVE IN THAT

GLITZY WE'VE TALKED ABOUT CARBON

02:15:30.155 --> 02:15:32.190
INTENSITY REDUCTION.

02:15:32.257 --> 02:15:34.359
AT YOU KNOW THAT WE WILL FEELS

WHAT YOU HAVE IS IN BLACK AND

02:15:45.270 --> 02:15:46.571
WHITE.

02:15:46.638 --> 02:15:48.073
NC INSERT BECOMES A REAL LIFE

02:15:48.139 --> 02:15:51.109
TEST -- BUT

02:15:51.176 --> 02:15:53.712
IF THIS CHART A GIVES YOU SUCH.

02:15:53.778 --> 02:15:56.882
AN APPRECIATION FOR HOW THE

02:15:56.948 --> 02:15:58.083
AVENUE WILL FEEL STACKED UP PRO

02:15:58.149 --> 02:16:00.252
MUCH THEY CONTRIBUTE.

02:16:00.318 --> 02:16:05.090
TO LET'S TALK ABOUT CREDITS.

02:16:05.156 --> 02:16:06.324
SO THE RED ONES ARE VARIOUS

02:16:06.391 --> 02:16:09.895
KINDS OF ETHANOL.

02:16:09.961 --> 02:16:12.030
AND THE BLUE ONES [inaudible]

02:16:12.097 --> 02:16:13.398
OUR BIODIESEL AND RENEWABLE

02:16:13.465 --> 02:16:16.501
DIESEL.

02:16:16.568 --> 02:16:18.603
AND THEN WHAT YOU SEE.

02:16:18.670 --> 02:16:20.906
WITH THE GREEN STRIPE HERE IS

02:16:20.972 --> 02:16:22.707
REALLY KIND OF THE GROWTH OF

02:16:22.774 --> 02:16:24.976
RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS SAID.

02:16:25.043 --> 02:16:26.144
IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA WHAT THESE

02:16:26.211 --> 02:16:27.846
PERCENTAGES ARE.

02:16:27.913 --> 02:16:29.881
AND THEN FROM THERE IT'S IT'S

02:16:29.948 --> 02:16:32.017
THE ELECTRICITY ON ROAD OFF FROM

02:16:32.083 --> 02:16:32.751
THE ROAD.

02:16:32.817 --> 02:16:35.186
ELECTRICITY PRIMARILY.

02:16:35.253 --> 02:16:36.721
BUT AND SO YOU ASKED A QUESTION

02:16:36.788 --> 02:16:39.324
EARLIER ABOUT HOW MUCH IS BLUE

02:16:39.391 --> 02:16:39.858
HOW MUCH THESE CREDITS ARE

02:16:39.925 --> 02:16:41.092
CAUSED BY COME FROM BLENDING AND

02:16:41.159 --> 02:16:42.861
HOW MUCH ARE PURCHASED.

02:16:42.928 --> 02:16:44.563
RIGHT SO THE REFINERS AND

02:16:44.629 --> 02:16:45.730
IMPORTERS.

02:16:45.797 --> 02:16:49.901
ARE BLENDING WITH A RED ETHANOL.

02:16:49.968 --> 02:16:52.804
BLUE BIODIESEL RENEWABLE DIESEL.

02:16:52.871 --> 02:16:54.372
AND THEY'RE BUYING FROM THE

02:16:54.439 --> 02:16:56.308
CREDIT PRODUCERS.

02:16:56.374 --> 02:16:57.242
OF RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS

02:16:57.309 --> 02:17:08.219
ELECTRICITY THE REST OF OKAY --

02:17:08.286 --> 02:17:10.822
MOVE ON TO PRICES.

02:17:10.889 --> 02:17:14.759
SO A ALEJO CHAU CHIU --

02:17:14.826 --> 02:17:16.995
THAT CREDIT PRICES.

02:17:17.062 --> 02:17:19.064
IN DOLLARS PER METRIC TON.

02:17:19.130 --> 02:17:20.899
AND THAT'S THE BIG BLUE LINE AND

02:17:20.966 --> 02:17:23.401
THE Y. AXIS LABELS SHOWS YOU THE

02:17:23.468 --> 02:17:26.071
DOLLARS PER TON.

02:17:26.137 --> 02:17:29.541
THE A OTHER LINES --

02:17:29.608 --> 02:17:31.910
OTHER WINDS ARE FOR GASOLINE AND

02:17:31.977 --> 02:17:32.644
DIESEL.

02:17:32.711 --> 02:17:34.479
AND THEIR PRICES ARE ON THE

02:17:34.546 --> 02:17:37.115
RIGHT HAND Y. AXIS.

02:17:37.182 --> 02:17:39.217
AND SO WHAT THIS SHOWS

02:17:39.284 --> 02:17:40.719
ESSENTIALLY IS THAT.

02:17:40.785 --> 02:17:43.989
AS OF LAST WEEK THE COST FOR

02:17:44.055 --> 02:17:48.193
CONSUMERS. FOR ELSE --

02:17:48.259 --> 02:17:49.494
FOR GASOLINE WAS ABOUT THIRTEEN

02:17:49.561 --> 02:17:52.330
CENTS AND FOUR DIESEL WAS A BIT

02:17:52.397 --> 02:17:59.638
MORE THAN.

02:17:59.704 --> 02:18:01.106
EIGHT AND AT AN AS YOU DISCUSS

02:18:01.172 --> 02:18:03.174
THE MAJORITY OF THE OF THE

02:18:03.241 --> 02:18:05.744
REVENUE FOR THESE CREDITS.

02:18:05.810 --> 02:18:07.812
OF FLOWS OUT OF STATE I THINK

02:18:07.879 --> 02:18:09.781
CARD SAID 13%.

02:18:09.848 --> 02:18:12.283
KNEELS NUMBER WAS 15%.

02:18:12.350 --> 02:18:13.718
BUT IT'S IT'S A BIT OF THE VAST

02:18:13.785 --> 02:18:15.353
MAJORITY BUT IN A DOESN'T STAY

02:18:15.420 --> 02:18:19.190
HERE BECAUSE OUT OF STATE

02:18:19.257 --> 02:18:19.491
[inaudible]

02:18:19.557 --> 02:18:23.395
OKAY SO WHERE'S THE PROGRAM NOW

02:18:23.461 --> 02:18:26.631
AND AND HOW TO GET HERE.

02:18:26.698 --> 02:18:28.600
WELL WE TALKED ABOUT.

02:18:28.667 --> 02:18:31.169
CARBON TNC REDUCTION HAS REACHED

02:18:31.236 --> 02:18:33.038
THREE AND A HALF PERCENT REACH

02:18:33.104 --> 02:18:34.939
THREE AND A HALF PERCENT IN.

02:18:35.006 --> 02:18:36.041
SEVENTEEN WAS REALLY DESIGNED TO

02:18:36.107 --> 02:18:38.410
BE FURTHER ALONG THAN THAT.

02:18:38.476 --> 02:18:40.011
BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT --

02:18:40.078 --> 02:18:42.113
LAWSUITS.

02:18:42.180 --> 02:18:44.282
CURRENT HELD THE REDUCTION LEVEL

02:18:44.349 --> 02:18:46.618
CONSTANT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OF

02:18:46.685 --> 02:18:47.485
THE PROGRAM.

02:18:47.552 --> 02:18:50.789
SO HERE WE ARE [inaudible] FOR

02:18:50.855 --> 02:18:52.824
SEVEN YEARS OR SO REALLY INTO

02:18:52.891 --> 02:18:53.425
THE PROGRAM WE GOT THREE AND A

02:18:53.491 --> 02:18:54.759
HALF CENT.

02:18:54.826 --> 02:18:56.795
AND AS KATHY SAID.

02:18:56.861 --> 02:18:57.362
TRINITY EASY THREE AND HALF

02:18:57.429 --> 02:18:59.064
HOURS.

02:18:59.130 --> 02:18:59.664
IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGHER FROM

02:18:59.731 --> 02:19:02.000
HERE.

02:19:02.067 --> 02:19:04.335
AND LET THESE OTHER STRIPED BARS

02:19:04.402 --> 02:19:05.336
REPRESENT.

02:19:05.403 --> 02:19:07.372
WHAT -- THEY

02:19:07.439 --> 02:19:08.173
ARE BE IS --

02:19:08.239 --> 02:19:09.908
HAD HIS.

02:19:09.974 --> 02:19:11.443
NO RECOMMEND THEIR PROPOSAL TO

02:19:11.509 --> 02:19:14.279
GET TO A 20% REDUCTION BY.

02:19:14.345 --> 02:19:15.447
TWENTY THIRTY THAT'S HOW MUCH

02:19:15.513 --> 02:19:16.414
REDUCTION THERE IS TO GO

02:19:16.481 --> 02:19:16.715
[inaudible]

02:19:16.781 --> 02:19:19.951
FROM HERE.

02:19:20.018 --> 02:19:22.320
SO THEN THE LEGISLATIVE ARE

02:19:22.387 --> 02:19:23.988
ANALYST'S OFFICE TALKED ABOUT

02:19:24.055 --> 02:19:24.956
CREDITS AND DEFICITS IN THE

02:19:25.023 --> 02:19:27.025
COULD TALK ABOUT A BANK.

02:19:27.092 --> 02:19:28.660
HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT BANK WHERE

02:19:28.727 --> 02:19:30.395
THE BAR CHARTS IN THE MIDDLE

02:19:30.462 --> 02:19:32.464
THERE THOSE SIR THE DIFFERENCE

02:19:32.530 --> 02:19:34.132
BETWEEN CREDITS AND DEFICITS

02:19:34.199 --> 02:19:34.833
THEY WERE GENERATED ON THE

02:19:34.899 --> 02:19:36.501
CORALIE BASIS.

02:19:36.568 --> 02:19:37.402
AND THEN THE REDLINE IT'S

02:19:37.469 --> 02:19:39.537
ACCUMULATED AMOUNT YOU CAN SEE

02:19:39.604 --> 02:19:40.238
THAT.

02:19:40.305 --> 02:19:43.308
BUT THAT BOTTOM THAT BANK GOT TO

02:19:43.375 --> 02:19:47.045
BE ABOUT TEN MILLION CREDITS.

02:19:47.112 --> 02:19:52.884
AND SEVENTEEN BUT BUT SOME OF

02:19:52.951 --> 02:19:53.985
CREDITS AND DEFICIT WAS ABOUT

02:19:54.052 --> 02:19:55.954
FLAT SO THAT THE BANK DIDN'T

02:19:56.020 --> 02:19:57.822
BUILD ALL.

02:19:57.889 --> 02:19:59.624
HERE IN SEVENTEEN AND I WOULD

02:19:59.691 --> 02:20:01.092
SAY WE WERE SORT OF SURPRISED BY

02:20:01.159 --> 02:20:03.094
THAT WE THOUGHT THAT THERE WOULD

02:20:03.161 --> 02:20:04.696
BE A BILL TO THE BANK.

02:20:04.763 --> 02:20:06.197
THE BANKS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT

02:20:06.264 --> 02:20:08.133
PROVIDES.

02:20:08.199 --> 02:20:12.003
A IT PROVIDES LIQUIDITY. FOR THE

02:20:12.070 --> 02:20:14.172
FOR THE TRADING SYSTEM BUT IT'S

02:20:14.239 --> 02:20:15.907
ALMOST LIKE YOU KNOW THAT OF ANY

02:20:15.974 --> 02:20:17.041
OTHER KIND OF A BANK IF IF THAT

02:20:17.108 --> 02:20:18.877
THERE'S MONEY AS A CASH IN THE

02:20:18.943 --> 02:20:20.945
AND THE AND THE BANKER BUT HE'S

02:20:21.012 --> 02:20:21.546
HAPPY AND THINGS FLOW BACK AND

02:20:21.613 --> 02:20:23.314
FORTH.

02:20:23.381 --> 02:20:24.983
AND WHAT WE THINK ONE OF THE

02:20:25.049 --> 02:20:26.351
THINGS WE THINK ABOUT WHEN WE

02:20:26.417 --> 02:20:28.286
LOOKED AT THE PRICES WILL RESUME

02:20:28.353 --> 02:20:29.487
BACK TO PRICE REAL QUICK HERE

02:20:29.554 --> 02:20:29.788
[inaudible]

02:20:29.854 --> 02:20:31.523
SEE.

02:20:31.589 --> 02:20:32.323
A PRETTY DRAMATIC MOVEMENT

02:20:32.390 --> 02:20:33.258
PRICES --

02:20:33.324 --> 02:20:36.494
THIS YEAR AND I THINK WE THINK

02:20:36.561 --> 02:20:38.062
THAT THAT'S PROBABLY RECOGNITION

02:20:38.129 --> 02:20:39.330
BY THE MARKETPLACE [inaudible]

02:20:39.397 --> 02:20:42.433
THAT -- THAT

02:20:42.500 --> 02:20:44.969
THE THAT THE BANKS DONE BUILDING.

02:20:45.036 --> 02:20:47.372
AND IS LIKELY TO START DRAWING

02:20:47.438 --> 02:20:48.840
THAT IS TO SAY THAT THERE BE A

02:20:48.907 --> 02:20:50.375
SUPPLY DEMAND IMBALANCE THAT BE

02:20:50.441 --> 02:20:51.209
MORE DEFICITS CREATED THING

02:20:51.276 --> 02:21:00.385
CREDITS.

02:21:00.451 --> 02:21:02.320
NOW AS I DO JUST BECAUSE IN OUR

02:21:02.387 --> 02:21:03.521
MOVING FROM THAT THREE AND A

02:21:03.588 --> 02:21:05.223
HALF PERCENT THE EASY.

02:21:05.290 --> 02:21:07.292
THE EASY PART NOW GET HERE OR

02:21:07.358 --> 02:21:08.760
DIDN'T PARTY NEEDS YOU CAN ONLY

02:21:08.827 --> 02:21:10.428
GO BACK UP AGAIN YOU CAN SEE HOW

02:21:10.495 --> 02:21:12.063
THESE.

02:21:12.130 --> 02:21:13.798
THE DEFICITS SORT OF WORK

02:21:13.865 --> 02:21:15.333
ROUGHLY CONSTANT WHILE THE

02:21:15.400 --> 02:21:17.468
LAWSUITS ARE GOING ON AT ONCE

02:21:17.535 --> 02:21:17.869
THAT WAS SETTLED.

02:21:17.936 --> 02:21:18.803
THEN.

02:21:18.870 --> 02:21:21.372
THE REQUIREMENT RATCHETED DOWN

02:21:21.439 --> 02:21:23.374
STEPPED FOR SEVENTEEN SIXTEEN

02:21:23.441 --> 02:21:25.476
AND THEN A STEP.

02:21:25.543 --> 02:21:26.044
FOR SEVENTEEN SO YOU CAN SEE

02:21:26.110 --> 02:21:27.278
THOSE STEPS IN AN AND NUMBER

02:21:27.345 --> 02:21:35.753
BEAUTIFUL PLACES.

02:21:35.820 --> 02:21:37.722
SO NOW THE CONSUMER COSTS ARE

02:21:37.789 --> 02:21:40.258
STARTING TO RISE.

02:21:40.325 --> 02:21:41.392
AND WHAT THIS [inaudible]

02:21:41.459 --> 02:21:45.663
THIS SHOWS INFANTS PER GALLON.

02:21:45.730 --> 02:21:47.932
AND DOLLARS PER TON THE HEALTH

02:21:47.999 --> 02:21:49.868
EFFECTS CREDIT PRICES.

02:21:49.934 --> 02:21:50.368
IN THE ESERVER GASOLINE

02:21:50.435 --> 02:21:50.668
[inaudible]

02:21:50.735 --> 02:21:54.739
BUT SO LOW LEVELS IT WASN'T

02:21:54.806 --> 02:21:56.608
KERMIT NOMINAL COST EARLY.

02:21:56.674 --> 02:21:59.978
AND BY.

02:22:00.044 --> 02:22:00.979
TWENTY SEVENTEEN TOTAL WAS ABOUT

02:22:01.045 --> 02:22:02.280
FOUR POINT SIX CENTS PER GALLON

02:22:02.347 --> 02:22:02.580
[inaudible]

02:22:02.647 --> 02:22:04.883
SO.

02:22:04.949 --> 02:22:05.516
THAT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE MUCH BUT

02:22:05.583 --> 02:22:09.387
IT IS -- SIX

02:22:09.454 --> 02:22:11.422
HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS.

02:22:11.489 --> 02:22:14.392
OF OF CASH TWIN OUT FROM

02:22:14.459 --> 02:22:17.528
CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS POCKETS.

02:22:17.595 --> 02:22:19.464
85% OF IT WENT SOMEPLACE ELSE

02:22:19.530 --> 02:22:19.764
[inaudible]

02:22:19.831 --> 02:22:25.203
OKAY THEN GOING FORWARD.

02:22:25.270 --> 02:22:26.838
THE NINE POINT SEVEN THAT WE

02:22:26.905 --> 02:22:31.542
HAVE IN HERE --

02:22:31.609 --> 02:22:32.043
FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT

02:22:32.110 --> 02:22:35.079
REPRESENTS THE AVERAGE VALUE FOR

02:22:35.146 --> 02:22:36.614
ALPHA FAST CREDIT PRICES.

02:22:36.681 --> 02:22:39.050
YEAR TO DATE.

02:22:39.117 --> 02:22:41.653
NOT AVERAGE AT A HUNDRED FORTY

02:22:41.719 --> 02:22:44.122
FIVE ALTHOUGH --

02:22:44.188 --> 02:22:46.224
BUT THE LATEST VALUES HAVE BEEN

02:22:46.291 --> 02:22:46.858
LIKE A HUNDRED EIGHTY DOLLARS A

02:22:46.925 --> 02:22:48.026
TON.

02:22:48.092 --> 02:22:49.794
AND THEM THESE HIGHER PRICES

02:22:49.861 --> 02:22:51.829
REPRESENT.

02:22:51.896 --> 02:22:54.666
VALUES THAT ARE CLOSE TO THE

02:22:54.732 --> 02:22:56.868
CREDIT CLEARING MARKET PRICE

02:22:56.935 --> 02:22:58.703
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT.

02:22:58.770 --> 02:23:00.371
TO FORECAST PRICES IN THIS

02:23:00.438 --> 02:23:02.440
SYSTEM YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW

02:23:02.507 --> 02:23:04.309
WHAT THE SUPPLY DEMAND BALANCE

02:23:04.375 --> 02:23:05.376
FOR CREDITS AND DEFICITS ARE

02:23:05.443 --> 02:23:07.578
GOING TO BE IT'S HARD TO KNOW.

02:23:07.645 --> 02:23:11.149
BUT IF YOU SAY THAT WE THINK

02:23:11.215 --> 02:23:12.450
LISTS THAT A RB IS GONNA HAVE A

02:23:12.517 --> 02:23:13.618
TOUGH TIME.

02:23:13.685 --> 02:23:14.218
COMING UP WITH ENOUGH CREDITS

02:23:14.285 --> 02:23:16.187
THAT THIS PROGRAM COULD RUN

02:23:16.254 --> 02:23:17.255
CLOSE TO THE CREDIT CLEARANCE

02:23:17.322 --> 02:23:18.523
PRICE.

02:23:18.589 --> 02:23:21.225
THOSE ARE THE PER GALLON PRICES

02:23:21.292 --> 02:23:22.827
THE CONSUMERS WOULD BE.

02:23:22.894 --> 02:23:23.561
THAT'S WHAT THESE PRICES

02:23:23.628 --> 02:23:27.598
REPRESENT [inaudible]

02:23:27.665 --> 02:23:29.133
OKAY.

02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:31.769
AND SO THE BIG SHOCK.

02:23:31.836 --> 02:23:34.605
CALIFORNIA DRIVERS PAVE A LOT.

02:23:34.672 --> 02:23:37.809
IN GASOLINE TAXES AND FEES.

02:23:37.875 --> 02:23:42.480
AND HERE YOU SEE THAT COMPONENTS --

02:23:42.547 --> 02:23:43.815
A FEDERAL EXCISE TAXES STATE

02:23:43.881 --> 02:23:47.318
EXCISE TAX.

02:23:47.385 --> 02:23:48.619
ALRIGHT UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANK

02:23:48.686 --> 02:23:50.421
FEES THIS STATE [inaudible]

02:23:50.488 --> 02:23:52.724
ARM.

02:23:52.790 --> 02:23:55.360
STATE AND LOCAL SALES TAX FEELS

02:23:55.426 --> 02:23:56.394
UNDER THE CAP WHICH IS THE CAP

02:23:56.461 --> 02:23:58.029
AND TRADE [inaudible]

02:23:58.096 --> 02:23:59.797
BAH COMPONENT.

02:23:59.864 --> 02:24:01.299
AND THEN --

02:24:01.366 --> 02:24:02.667
LOOK APPEALS.

02:24:02.734 --> 02:24:05.103
TO AND SO YOU YOU ADD UP THIS

02:24:05.169 --> 02:24:06.704
CHART YOU GET ABOUT FORTY TWO

02:24:06.771 --> 02:24:07.939
CENTS A GALLON MORE.

02:24:08.006 --> 02:24:11.542
U. S. AVERAGE.

02:24:11.609 --> 02:24:13.011
OKAY SO WHERE IS THE PROGRAM GO

02:24:13.077 --> 02:24:16.514
FROM HERE --

02:24:16.581 --> 02:24:17.815
IS WE TALKED ABOUT THE RITUAL

02:24:17.882 --> 02:24:19.650
PROGRAM RITUAL SCHEDULES BEING

02:24:19.717 --> 02:24:22.387
MODIFIED OUT.

02:24:22.453 --> 02:24:23.654
TO TWENTY THIRTY AND THE TWENTY

02:24:23.721 --> 02:24:24.622
TWENTY GOAL GETS CHANGED FROM

02:24:24.689 --> 02:24:26.858
10%.

02:24:26.924 --> 02:24:27.392
TO FROM 10% TO SEVEN HAVE

02:24:27.458 --> 02:24:27.959
PERCENT.

02:24:28.026 --> 02:24:31.929
THAT'S A GOOD THING [inaudible]

02:24:31.996 --> 02:24:34.265
BECAUSE A KATHY DESCRIBED IS

02:24:34.332 --> 02:24:35.666
COSTING PAYMENT.

02:24:35.733 --> 02:24:36.834
WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR A LONG

02:24:36.901 --> 02:24:38.536
TIME WAS?

02:24:38.603 --> 02:24:39.871
THE PROGRAM WAS IN FEASIBLE AND

02:24:39.937 --> 02:24:40.438
THEY NEEDED TO MOVE THE GOAL

02:24:40.505 --> 02:24:41.906
POSTS.

02:24:41.973 --> 02:24:44.142
AND SO BY MOVING IT BACK TO

02:24:44.208 --> 02:24:44.675
SEVEN HALF PERCENT THEY'VE

02:24:44.742 --> 02:24:47.478
ACCOMPLISHED THAT [inaudible]

02:24:47.545 --> 02:24:49.781
NOW.

02:24:49.847 --> 02:24:50.615
WHAT'S THE PROGRAM GONNA HAVE

02:24:50.681 --> 02:24:51.516
YOU GONNA IF YOU COULDN'T

02:24:51.582 --> 02:24:54.185
DECREASE CARBON INTENSITY BY.

02:24:54.252 --> 02:24:55.620
20% AND THEN IN THE NEXT TEN

02:24:55.686 --> 02:24:57.221
YEARS.

02:24:57.288 --> 02:24:58.623
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO

02:24:58.689 --> 02:24:59.590
SOMETHING ABOUT GASOLINE

02:24:59.657 --> 02:24:59.891
[inaudible]

02:24:59.957 --> 02:25:02.393
RIGHT -- THE

02:25:02.460 --> 02:25:03.795
GRAPHIC REDUCE CARBON TENSELY

02:25:03.861 --> 02:25:05.663
GASOLINE REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF

02:25:05.730 --> 02:25:08.232
GASOLINE THAT'S THAT'S LET'S GO

02:25:08.299 --> 02:25:09.534
CONSUMED YOU HAVE TO DO

02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:10.735
SOMETHING BACK GHASTLY.

02:25:10.802 --> 02:25:12.904
WHICH IS NOT GONNA BE EASY GIVEN

02:25:12.970 --> 02:25:15.773
THAT GASOLINE DEMANDS NOT PEAKED.

02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:17.708
IN THE DESPITE LE ESTIMATES OF

02:25:17.775 --> 02:25:19.277
ALL KINDS OF FORECASTERS ME

02:25:19.343 --> 02:25:21.679
INCLUDED --

02:25:21.746 --> 02:25:22.480
GASSING MAN HAVE GONE DOWN

02:25:22.547 --> 02:25:22.780
[inaudible]

02:25:22.847 --> 02:25:23.815
NO [inaudible]

02:25:23.881 --> 02:25:25.583
KATHLEEN GETS IT'S MORE

02:25:25.650 --> 02:25:27.852
EXPENSIVE IT THAT'LL CHANGE BUT

02:25:27.919 --> 02:25:29.053
IT HASN'T IT HASN'T PICKED YET

02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:32.190
THAT WE CAN SAY.

02:25:32.256 --> 02:25:34.358
ANOTHER THING THAT WOULD BE GOOD

02:25:34.425 --> 02:25:34.926
FOR THIS PROGRAM IS HIGH OIL

02:25:34.992 --> 02:25:37.028
PRICES.

02:25:37.095 --> 02:25:37.962
RIGHT HIGHER OIL PRICES WOULD

02:25:38.029 --> 02:25:39.897
REDUCE.

02:25:39.964 --> 02:25:41.199
A WELL DEMAND [inaudible]

02:25:41.265 --> 02:25:45.069
AND AND A LIKELY WOULD SPUR

02:25:45.136 --> 02:25:46.304
INVESTMENT AND INNOVATION.

02:25:46.370 --> 02:25:49.307
IN THE SPACE AND HOW IT WOULD

02:25:49.373 --> 02:25:50.174
SAY THAT THE ONLY SAY THE

02:25:50.241 --> 02:25:51.109
HEALTHCARE PASSES.

02:25:51.175 --> 02:25:51.909
HAS SPURRED INNOVATION YOU'VE

02:25:51.976 --> 02:25:53.845
HEARD ABOUT IT FROM PACIFIC

02:25:53.911 --> 02:25:55.713
ETHANOL INTELLIGENCE PRETTY

02:25:55.780 --> 02:25:57.782
INNOVATIVE THINGS CONNECTING

02:25:57.849 --> 02:26:00.151
GARY'S OF PIPELINES AND HEARD.

02:26:00.218 --> 02:26:00.618
MOVE STUFF AROUND FATS

02:26:00.685 --> 02:26:02.053
INNOVATION [inaudible]

02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:05.957
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHICH CAN COUNT

02:26:06.023 --> 02:26:08.726
ON HIGH CRUDE PRICES.

02:26:08.793 --> 02:26:11.362
GIVEN THAT THE SUCCESS OF THE

02:26:11.429 --> 02:26:12.930
DRILLERS.

02:26:12.997 --> 02:26:14.132
IN TEXAS AND NORTH DAKOTA AND

02:26:14.198 --> 02:26:17.068
PLACES LIKE THAT [inaudible]

02:26:17.135 --> 02:26:18.936
OKAY SO.

02:26:19.003 --> 02:26:19.937
HIGH PRICES ARE NEEDED TO

02:26:20.004 --> 02:26:22.073
ENCOURAGE NEW INVESTMENT.

02:26:22.140 --> 02:26:23.241
WHO ONE OF THINGS THAT WE THINK

02:26:23.307 --> 02:26:24.976
MIGHT VERY WELL HAPPEN AS THAT

02:26:25.042 --> 02:26:26.744
THE REFINERS WILL GET INTERESTED

02:26:26.811 --> 02:26:27.712
MAKING RENEWABLE DIESEL HER

02:26:27.778 --> 02:26:29.981
NOBLE GASOLINE?

02:26:30.047 --> 02:26:32.650
AND SO THEY WILL HIM WE HAVE

02:26:32.717 --> 02:26:35.153
IMPLY THAT THE PRODUCTION OF

02:26:35.219 --> 02:26:36.154
THAT HAVE THAT HANGING --

02:26:36.220 --> 02:26:38.856
INDUSTRIAL SCALE.

02:26:38.923 --> 02:26:43.261
SO THAT MIGHT VERY WELL HAPPEN --

02:26:43.327 --> 02:26:44.362
CERTAINLY.

02:26:44.428 --> 02:26:46.164
VERY RAPID ADOPTION OF

02:26:46.230 --> 02:26:47.965
ALTERNATIVE VEHICLES IS REQUIRED

02:26:48.032 --> 02:26:49.500
IN ORDER TO MEET THE KINDS OF

02:26:49.567 --> 02:26:50.334
GOALS THAT THEY ARE BE IS

02:26:50.401 --> 02:26:54.472
TALKING ABOUT.

02:26:54.539 --> 02:26:55.840
AND THEN ONE OF THINGS THAT.

02:26:55.907 --> 02:26:57.208
THAT BOTHERED ME OVER THE

02:26:57.275 --> 02:26:58.609
WEEKEND WAS READING AN ARTICLE

02:26:58.676 --> 02:27:00.178
ON THE STUFF AND SEE IF YOU SEE

02:27:00.244 --> 02:27:01.579
AS HAVING A FIGHT WITH THE

02:27:01.646 --> 02:27:03.080
PUBLIC UTILITIES OVER.

02:27:03.147 --> 02:27:05.016
HOW MUCH THEY GONNA SPEND TO PUT

02:27:05.082 --> 02:27:05.683
IN CHARGING STATIONS

02:27:05.750 --> 02:27:05.983
[inaudible]

02:27:06.050 --> 02:27:07.285
I THOUGHT.

02:27:07.351 --> 02:27:10.955
YOU KNOW THERE'S WHAT ALL WAS

02:27:11.022 --> 02:27:12.156
EVERYBODY ELSE SPENDING ON THAT

02:27:12.223 --> 02:27:12.723
STUFF [inaudible]

02:27:12.790 --> 02:27:14.592
RIGHT.

02:27:14.659 --> 02:27:16.561
INCOME TAX REBATES UTILITY GREAT

02:27:16.627 --> 02:27:17.662
INCENTIVES AB ONE EIGHTEEN

02:27:17.728 --> 02:27:19.564
GRANTS [inaudible]

02:27:19.630 --> 02:27:22.333
HOV LANES.

02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:25.336
CAP AND TRADE AUCTIONS SENATORS --

02:27:25.403 --> 02:27:26.938
CREDIT SALES FOR YOU TO OF ALL

02:27:27.004 --> 02:27:29.607
THIS STUFF.

02:27:29.674 --> 02:27:31.642
I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO TO FIND

02:27:31.709 --> 02:27:34.879
OUT WHAT TAXPAYERS AND CONSUMERS

02:27:34.946 --> 02:27:37.048
ARE PAN FOR ALL THAT STUFF.

02:27:37.114 --> 02:27:38.549
AND I DON'T KNOW.

02:27:38.616 --> 02:27:40.451
WHICH ONES ARE MORE COST

02:27:40.518 --> 02:27:43.621
EFFECTIVE THAN THE OTHER ONES.

02:27:43.688 --> 02:27:44.622
SO.

02:27:44.689 --> 02:27:46.023
IT SO WHAT WEEK SUGGESTS HERE

02:27:46.090 --> 02:27:47.258
WAS A CLEARINGHOUSE TO PROVIDE

02:27:47.325 --> 02:27:49.327
TRANSPARENCY FOR THE TOTAL COST

02:27:49.393 --> 02:27:50.728
OF VB INSIDE OF SPENDING

02:27:50.795 --> 02:27:51.495
PROGRESS.

02:27:51.562 --> 02:27:53.431
NOT SAYING IT'S A BAD THING I

02:27:53.497 --> 02:27:54.332
JUST WANT TO KNOW WHICH ONES.

02:27:54.398 --> 02:27:56.601
ARE THE BEST.

02:27:56.667 --> 02:27:57.802
AND AND SHOULD GET THE MOST

02:27:57.868 --> 02:28:01.038
FOCUS.

02:28:01.105 --> 02:28:02.807
AND THEN CONTINUING THE FAME

02:28:02.873 --> 02:28:05.910
MORE CREDIT GENERATIONS REQUIRED.

02:28:05.977 --> 02:28:07.979
TO TO ACHIEVE CARBS GOALS.

02:28:08.045 --> 02:28:09.480
AND THERE THERE IS A PRETTY LONG

02:28:09.547 --> 02:28:11.515
LIST OF THINGS.

02:28:11.582 --> 02:28:12.850
THAT -- THAT

02:28:12.917 --> 02:28:14.986
OUGHT TO BE DONE AND AND THEN

A COUPLE OF PROJECTS OUT THERE

02:28:29.300 --> 02:28:31.736
YOU WOULD USE SOLAR SOLAR POWER

02:28:31.802 --> 02:28:34.605
TO CREATE STEAM. TO LEARN HOW.

02:28:34.672 --> 02:28:36.941
TO INJECT IN IN THOSE HEAVY OIL

MISSION --

02:30:41.065 --> 02:30:44.969
BUSES AND THAT'S SPECIFICALLY

02:30:45.035 --> 02:30:46.637
ARE RECENT.

02:30:46.704 --> 02:30:48.906
A GOAL OUR BOARD APPROVED TO

FIVE BY THE END OF THIS YEAR --

02:31:05.423 --> 02:31:09.160
AND WE ARE ALSO PROUD THAT OUR

02:31:09.226 --> 02:31:11.162
FOURTH BUS RAPID TRANSIT ROUTE--

02:31:11.228 --> 02:31:12.930
WOULD SAY IT WAS THE FIRST ALL

02:31:12.997 --> 02:31:14.398
ELECTRIC BUS RAPID OR ALL

02:31:14.465 --> 02:31:16.066
BATTERY ELECTRIC BUS RAPID

02:31:16.133 --> 02:31:17.868
TRANSIT ROUTE IN THE NATION AS

02:31:17.935 --> 02:31:19.236
WELL -- CHI

02:31:19.303 --> 02:31:20.571
JUST ASK YOUR QUESTION THERE IS

02:31:20.638 --> 02:31:21.539
YOU SEEMS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN

02:31:21.605 --> 02:31:23.974
MOVING TO EACH TECHNOLOGY ARE

02:31:24.041 --> 02:31:25.142
EACH DIFFERENT FEEL TYPE.

02:31:25.209 --> 02:31:26.844
HAVE YOU SEEN A DIFFERENCE IN

02:31:26.911 --> 02:31:30.648
THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THE BUSES OR

02:31:30.714 --> 02:31:31.682
ARE THEY ARE THEY MORE EFFICIENT

02:31:31.749 --> 02:31:33.517
AT THE COSTS.

02:31:33.584 --> 02:31:35.553
ACOSTA BEING LESS BECAUSE OF

02:31:35.619 --> 02:31:37.221
FUELS WHEN.

02:31:37.288 --> 02:31:39.256
COSTS LESS OR IS IT COSTING MORE

02:31:39.323 --> 02:31:41.225
AND MAINTENANCE OR YOU KNOW

02:31:41.292 --> 02:31:42.460
GIVEN THAT YOU MOVE FROM SEEMS

02:31:42.526 --> 02:31:44.428
LIKE YOU MOVE FROM.

02:31:44.495 --> 02:31:46.430
EACH DIFFERENT METER.

02:31:46.497 --> 02:31:48.666
THE YEAH WE DEFINITELY SEEN UP.

02:31:48.732 --> 02:31:49.467
WITH THE DIESEL TO HYBRID WE

02:31:49.533 --> 02:31:52.069
SOLVE.

02:31:52.136 --> 02:31:54.371
REDUCTION IN IN THE FIELD ARE

02:31:54.438 --> 02:31:56.040
USING SO WE'RE ABLE.

02:31:56.106 --> 02:31:57.675
TO GET SOME MORE MILES PER

02:31:57.741 --> 02:31:59.710
GALLON ON ON THAT WHEN WE MOVE

02:31:59.777 --> 02:32:02.012
TO ELECTRIC BUSES WE ALSO SAW.

02:32:02.079 --> 02:32:04.014
A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE

02:32:04.081 --> 02:32:06.016
COST TO OPERATE --

02:32:06.083 --> 02:32:07.318
THE BUS --

02:32:07.384 --> 02:32:09.220
SO WE RECEIVED AYE BUT ABOUT A

02:32:09.286 --> 02:32:12.056
ONE THIRD OF THE COST OF DIESEL --

02:32:12.122 --> 02:32:14.391
HOWEVER THAT WAS ALSO GETS WILL

02:32:14.458 --> 02:32:16.360
BE MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE THAT

02:32:16.427 --> 02:32:17.361
WAS VERY --

02:32:17.428 --> 02:32:18.963
AT THAT PERIOD WHEN WE FIRST

02:32:19.029 --> 02:32:20.798
STARTED A RUNNER BUT ELECTRIC

02:32:20.865 --> 02:32:22.433
BUSES.

02:32:22.500 --> 02:32:23.834
WE HAVE A TWO YEAR WAIVER FROM

02:32:23.901 --> 02:32:26.103
THE UTILITY COMPANY. TO WAIVE

02:32:26.170 --> 02:32:28.706
DEMAND CHARGES BECAUSE OUR BUSES

02:32:28.772 --> 02:32:30.241
THEY DROPPED QUITE A BIT A POWER

02:32:30.307 --> 02:32:31.075
AND I IN THE SHORT PERIOD OF

02:32:31.141 --> 02:32:32.510
TIME BECAUSE OF THE FAST CHARGE

02:32:32.576 --> 02:32:33.511
TYPE BUSES.

02:32:33.577 --> 02:32:35.346
AND SO --

02:32:35.412 --> 02:32:38.449
WHEN THAT EXPIRED --

02:32:38.516 --> 02:32:43.387
THE THAT BASICALLY LEFT --

02:32:43.454 --> 02:32:44.388
FOR US TO BEAR THE BURDEN OF

02:32:44.455 --> 02:32:45.456
THOSE DEMAND CHARGES WHICH

02:32:45.523 --> 02:32:46.957
ACTUALLY.

02:32:47.024 --> 02:32:48.726
BECAUSE THAT THE COST TO BE

02:32:48.792 --> 02:32:51.629
ABOVE WHAT WE'RE PAYING FOR THAT

02:32:51.695 --> 02:32:53.197
ARE DIESEL BUSES HA SO WHAT'S

02:32:53.264 --> 02:32:54.031
OUR TENT IT WAS REMOVED IT UP

02:32:54.098 --> 02:32:56.734
COSTING MORE. TO TO RUN THE

02:32:56.800 --> 02:32:57.034
FLEET YEAH.

02:32:57.101 --> 02:32:58.402
YEAH.

02:32:58.469 --> 02:33:00.037
SO -- I KNOW

02:33:00.104 --> 02:33:02.072
THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S A BILL.

02:33:02.139 --> 02:33:03.440
I THINK IT'S FOURTEEN THIRTY

02:33:03.507 --> 02:33:05.743
FOUR THAT US --

02:33:05.809 --> 02:33:09.179
THE UTILITY COMPANIES TO LOOK AT%

02:33:09.246 --> 02:33:10.614
OF RATE STRUCTURE SPECIFICALLY

02:33:10.681 --> 02:33:13.284
FOR THIS USE CAN TO PROMOTE THE

02:33:13.350 --> 02:33:15.019
DEPLOYMENT OF THESE BUSES.

02:33:15.085 --> 02:33:16.520
SEND WERE ALSO LOOKING INTO

02:33:16.587 --> 02:33:18.255
BATTERY STORAGE AND OTHER THINGS

02:33:18.322 --> 02:33:20.424
YOU NEED. TO AVOID THOSE COSTS

02:33:20.491 --> 02:33:22.526
AS WELL I KNOW WE HAVE HEARD OF

02:33:22.593 --> 02:33:23.160
SOME BUSES I KNOW.

02:33:23.227 --> 02:33:25.362
I'M OUR OFFICE.

02:33:25.429 --> 02:33:27.064
THAT SOME ELECTRIC BUSES HAD

02:33:27.131 --> 02:33:28.465
TROUBLE.

02:33:28.532 --> 02:33:31.468
NAVIGATING HILLS AND HAVING THE

02:33:31.535 --> 02:33:32.770
YOU KNOW ONCE IRAQ PASSIVELY IT

02:33:32.836 --> 02:33:33.904
GOING UP HILLS HAVE BEEN HAVE

02:33:33.971 --> 02:33:35.439
YOU GUYS HAD ANY OF THOSE ISSUES

02:33:35.506 --> 02:33:36.006
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THOSE

02:33:36.073 --> 02:33:37.041
ISSUES.

02:33:37.107 --> 02:33:37.808
THIRD OF THOSE ISSUES BUT WE

02:33:37.875 --> 02:33:40.544
HAVEN'T HAD THOSE THOSE ISSUES.

02:33:40.611 --> 02:33:41.612
I THINK THOSE WERE DIFFERENT

02:33:41.679 --> 02:33:44.214
TYPE OF BUSES AND ALSO --

02:33:44.281 --> 02:33:46.083
OUR TERRAIN IS A LOT FLATTER

02:33:46.150 --> 02:33:47.484
HAVE BEEN THE MOTHER TURNED ON

02:33:47.551 --> 02:33:49.486
SO WE THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD.

02:33:49.553 --> 02:33:52.256
THE SAME TYPES OF CHALLENGES

02:33:52.323 --> 02:33:53.657
THAT METHODS WHICH YOU HEARD OF

02:33:53.724 --> 02:33:55.292
THAT HAS AN INVITE BOTH YOU OUT

02:33:55.359 --> 02:33:55.926
TO FORT OF ON MY DISTRICT TO

02:33:55.993 --> 02:33:58.429
CHECK OUT THE HOME OF GREEN BOSS

02:33:58.495 --> 02:33:59.396
AND WILL GET YOU BOTH SET OUT

02:33:59.463 --> 02:33:59.697
[inaudible]

02:33:59.763 --> 02:34:01.699
GREAT YEAH.

02:34:01.765 --> 02:34:03.434
GOD PLEASE CONTINUE CLOSER.

02:34:03.500 --> 02:34:07.171
SO -- THE

02:34:07.237 --> 02:34:09.206
WE'VE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DEPLOY

02:34:09.273 --> 02:34:10.207
THIS I'M.

02:34:10.274 --> 02:34:11.041
YET STOCKTON IS IN THAT

02:34:11.108 --> 02:34:12.576
DISCIPLINE YOU KNOW COLLECTION

02:34:12.643 --> 02:34:14.144
OF DISADVANTAGED AREAS --

02:34:14.211 --> 02:34:15.045
BOTH ECONOMICALLY

02:34:15.112 --> 02:34:18.282
ENVIRONMENTALLY SO WE WE AND OUR

02:34:18.349 --> 02:34:19.717
TV IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US.

02:34:19.783 --> 02:34:20.951
TO MAINTAIN OUR INCREASED

02:34:21.018 --> 02:34:22.553
SERVICE LEVELS.

02:34:22.620 --> 02:34:24.855
AND ALSO DELIVERED THIS --

02:34:24.922 --> 02:34:26.991
THAT THE QUEEN TECHNOLOGY TO OUR

02:34:27.057 --> 02:34:27.925
CUSTOMERS WHO DEPEND ON AYE AYE

02:34:27.992 --> 02:34:29.360
BUSES.

02:34:29.426 --> 02:34:31.362
AND HELP THEM THE AIR POLLUTION

02:34:31.428 --> 02:34:32.563
IN THE AREA.

02:34:32.630 --> 02:34:34.064
AS WELL AS THE THAT GREENHOUSE

02:34:34.131 --> 02:34:35.933
GAS EMISSIONS --

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.736
SO ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES WE WANT

02:34:38.802 --> 02:34:40.371
TO DEPLOY THIS TECHNOLOGY BUT WE

02:34:40.437 --> 02:34:41.271
DON'T WANT TO DO IT AT THE

02:34:41.338 --> 02:34:44.375
EXPENSE OF OUR OUR PASSENGERS AS

02:34:44.441 --> 02:34:46.543
FAR AS VOLUME OF SERVICE.

02:34:46.610 --> 02:34:48.345
SO WE NEED TO DEPLOY THESE

02:34:48.412 --> 02:34:50.180
TECHNOLOGIES IN A COST EFFECTIVE

02:34:50.247 --> 02:34:50.347
WAY.

02:34:50.414 --> 02:34:51.782
THAT DOESN'T.

02:34:51.849 --> 02:34:53.517
THAT DOESN'T TAKE OPERATING

02:34:53.584 --> 02:34:54.151
COSTS WHICH IS VERY PRECIOUS FOR

02:34:54.218 --> 02:34:55.753
US.

02:34:55.819 --> 02:34:56.754
MON TO RUN THESE THESE ROUTES

02:34:56.820 --> 02:34:58.389
EVERY YEAR.

02:34:58.455 --> 02:34:59.957
IT TO MAKE THIS TRANSITION SO

02:35:00.024 --> 02:35:01.925
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO TAP INTO.

02:35:01.992 --> 02:35:04.628
DIFFERENT GRANTS THE DID TO DO

02:35:04.695 --> 02:35:06.063
TO PLAY MISSILE DEPLOYMENTS OF

02:35:06.130 --> 02:35:09.266
SOME VEHICLES WE'VE BEEN ABLE --

02:35:09.333 --> 02:35:11.235
TO ALSO --

02:35:11.301 --> 02:35:12.870
THAT RELY ON THAT THE H. FIT

02:35:12.936 --> 02:35:14.071
PROGRAM.

02:35:14.138 --> 02:35:16.173
TO REDUCE THE COST OF THE THE

02:35:16.240 --> 02:35:18.375
THE VEHICLES THEMSELVES.

02:35:18.442 --> 02:35:21.045
AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THE LCD SF

02:35:21.111 --> 02:35:21.645
IS REALLY --

02:35:21.712 --> 02:35:24.948
AS SUCH IT'S SOMETHING TO OFFSET

02:35:25.015 --> 02:35:27.985
THE COST OF ELECTRICITY THAT.

02:35:28.052 --> 02:35:29.687
THAT WE PURCHASE A YOU RUN THESE

02:35:29.753 --> 02:35:30.888
FEARS OF THE INCENTIVES AREN'T

02:35:30.954 --> 02:35:33.991
THERE ON THE ELECTRIC RATES FOR

02:35:34.058 --> 02:35:36.060
THE ELECTRIC BUSES IN.

02:35:36.126 --> 02:35:37.661
GIVEN THAT IT WOULD COST MORE

02:35:37.728 --> 02:35:38.929
THAN WOULD YOU GUYS LOOK AT

02:35:38.996 --> 02:35:41.098
USING LIKE REGULAR DIESEL OR

02:35:41.165 --> 02:35:43.434
BIODIESEL GOING BACK TO THOSE

02:35:43.500 --> 02:35:46.437
TYPES OF TECHNOLOGIES OR WHAT

02:35:46.503 --> 02:35:47.771
WOULD.

02:35:47.838 --> 02:35:48.639
WHAT DO YOU SEE YOU GUYS HAVE TO

02:35:48.706 --> 02:35:50.507
SPEAK TO HIM YEAH SO WE WERE

02:35:50.574 --> 02:35:50.974
HOPING THAT THERE'S A

02:35:51.041 --> 02:35:52.242
COMBINATION OF?

02:35:52.309 --> 02:35:54.044
YOU NO STABILIZATION IN THE

02:35:54.111 --> 02:35:55.546
RATES AS FAR AS THE DEMAND

02:35:55.612 --> 02:35:58.182
CHARGES ON ON CHARGING THESE

02:35:58.248 --> 02:36:00.651
THESE VEHICLES THEMSELVES --

02:36:00.718 --> 02:36:01.685
YOU KNOW COPING COST THE

02:36:01.752 --> 02:36:03.220
VEHICLES GETS CONTINUE TO TO GO

02:36:03.287 --> 02:36:04.688
DOWN -- AS

02:36:04.755 --> 02:36:05.789
THEY HAVE --

02:36:05.856 --> 02:36:08.425
THE H. FIT PROGRAM THAT OR THAT

02:36:08.492 --> 02:36:11.628
SUPPLEMENTS THE COST ALSO HELPS --

02:36:11.695 --> 02:36:13.764
AND WE ALSO EARN CREDITS FOR IT

02:36:13.831 --> 02:36:14.331
THROUGH THE HEALTHY AT THAT

02:36:14.398 --> 02:36:16.400
PROGRAM --

02:36:16.467 --> 02:36:18.435
BECAUSE WERE WERE WERE MAKING

02:36:18.502 --> 02:36:19.737
THESE ABOUT ESTIMATES BECAUSE

02:36:19.803 --> 02:36:21.071
WHAT THE CREDIT YOU CAN OFFSET

02:36:21.138 --> 02:36:22.039
THE COST BECAUSE YOU COULD SELL

02:36:22.106 --> 02:36:22.339
[inaudible]

02:36:22.406 --> 02:36:24.441
YES.

02:36:24.508 --> 02:36:26.076
EXACTLY SO THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S

02:36:26.143 --> 02:36:28.479
OUR IT BENEFIT DEFINITELY

02:36:28.545 --> 02:36:30.147
BENEFITS US IN OUR WRITERS TO BE

02:36:30.214 --> 02:36:31.749
ABLE TO AND TO MAKE THE

02:36:31.815 --> 02:36:32.750
TRANSITION.

02:36:32.816 --> 02:36:35.018
AND STILL MAINTAIN --

02:36:35.085 --> 02:36:36.687
THE LEVEL OF SERVICE THAT WE'VE

02:36:36.754 --> 02:36:38.388
BEEN PROVIDING AND HOPE.

02:36:38.455 --> 02:36:40.023
TO GROW THAT AS THE ECONOMY IS

02:36:40.090 --> 02:36:43.026
IMPROVING A LOT OF OUR FUNDING

02:36:43.093 --> 02:36:44.561
RESOURCES ARE BASED ON TAX

02:36:44.628 --> 02:36:45.629
DOLLARS PLEASE GOD YOU SAY YOU

02:36:45.696 --> 02:36:48.232
GUYS WENT THAT DIRECTION AND

02:36:48.298 --> 02:36:49.833
BECAUSE OF REGULATIONS FROM THE

02:36:49.900 --> 02:36:50.567
STATE.

02:36:50.634 --> 02:36:53.971
AND INCENTIVES THAT WE PROVIDED --

02:36:54.037 --> 02:36:55.806
YES ABSOLUTELY YES SO OF THE

02:36:55.873 --> 02:36:57.574
INCENTIVES AND REGULATIONS TURN

02:36:57.641 --> 02:36:58.976
THE OTHER WAY.

02:36:59.042 --> 02:37:00.210
DO YOU THINK MOST CITIES IN

02:37:00.277 --> 02:37:01.145
THEIR CELLS WOULD CHANGE THE

02:37:01.211 --> 02:37:03.714
OTHER DIRECTION --

02:37:03.781 --> 02:37:05.849
I WOULD SAY BE A HARD DECISION

02:37:05.916 --> 02:37:07.651
SOMETHING THAT WE LOOK AT HAVE.

02:37:07.718 --> 02:37:09.887
TO LOOK OUT HARD AND GATHERED

02:37:09.953 --> 02:37:11.188
ABOUT GET THE TICKET OFFICE

02:37:11.255 --> 02:37:12.790
LAWYERS KNEW WHAT IS THE COST.

02:37:12.856 --> 02:37:13.791
WELL HOW MANY YOU KNOW HOW MUCH

02:37:13.857 --> 02:37:14.992
AVIANO JUST GIVE YOU THE FEATHER

02:37:15.058 --> 02:37:16.527
MOST CITIES I THINK --

02:37:16.593 --> 02:37:17.427
THAT ALL THE WRITING ON THE

02:37:17.494 --> 02:37:18.595
WALLS OF THE STATE PUSHED IN ONE

02:37:18.662 --> 02:37:21.365
DIRECTION AND MOVE THAT WAY AS

02:37:21.431 --> 02:37:23.233
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

02:37:23.300 --> 02:37:25.302
IN AND BUDGET WHICH IS WHY YOU

02:37:25.369 --> 02:37:26.804
GUYS ARE WHERE YOU'RE AT AND I

02:37:26.870 --> 02:37:28.405
KNOW THAT'S WHY A LOT OF OUR OUR

02:37:28.472 --> 02:37:29.706
CITIES ARE WHERE THEY ARE TO

02:37:29.773 --> 02:37:31.041
YEAH DEFINITELY I MEAN WE'VE.

02:37:31.108 --> 02:37:31.708
WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN ON THE

02:37:31.775 --> 02:37:34.278
FOREFRONT BUT YOU KNOW.

02:37:34.344 --> 02:37:36.280
YOU KNOW WE DEFINITELY SEEN THE

02:37:36.346 --> 02:37:38.015
REGULATIONS COM AND YOU KNOW

02:37:38.081 --> 02:37:40.584
IT'S AYE MODEL GOTTARDO DOWN THE

02:37:40.651 --> 02:37:43.587
COST NOW DOESN'T IT YEAH.

02:37:43.654 --> 02:37:44.888
APPRECIATE THAT ON A FEW

02:37:44.955 --> 02:37:45.923
FINISHING JUST MONEY FEE OF

02:37:45.989 --> 02:37:50.794
ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY --

02:37:50.861 --> 02:37:52.196
SO WOULD I WOULD JUST THAT CLOSE

02:37:52.262 --> 02:37:53.363
WITH THAT THE HEALTHIER --

02:37:53.430 --> 02:37:55.666
I'LL SEE IF.

02:37:55.732 --> 02:37:57.201
THAT'S PROGRAM BOTH ENCOURAGES

02:37:57.267 --> 02:37:59.069
PARA TRANSIT AGENCIES TO MAKE.

02:37:59.136 --> 02:38:00.437
MAKE THAT THE INVESTMENTS IN

02:38:00.504 --> 02:38:02.639
THIS TECHNOLOGY AND IT ALSO

02:38:02.706 --> 02:38:04.341
SUPPORTS THE INDUSTRY'S --

02:38:04.408 --> 02:38:05.943
THAT SUPPLY THE VEHICLES THE

02:38:06.009 --> 02:38:08.712
CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURES --

02:38:08.779 --> 02:38:10.881
AND AT THE SAME TIME IT.

02:38:10.948 --> 02:38:13.250
DOESN'T MAKE US MAKE A CHOICE

02:38:13.317 --> 02:38:14.852
BETWEEN OPERATING DOLLARS IT'S

02:38:14.918 --> 02:38:16.286
HARD TO INVEST THIS IN.

02:38:16.353 --> 02:38:17.955
NEW INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES OR

02:38:18.021 --> 02:38:19.656
DO WE INVEST AND REINVEST THIS

02:38:19.723 --> 02:38:21.892
INTO.-OUR DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS AND

02:38:21.959 --> 02:38:23.994
SERVICE CALLER THANK YOU

02:38:24.061 --> 02:38:24.294
[inaudible]

02:38:24.361 --> 02:38:26.530
THANK YOU.

02:38:26.597 --> 02:38:28.365
RIGHT LET ME ASK --

02:38:28.432 --> 02:38:29.199
SIR -- HACK

02:38:29.266 --> 02:38:31.435
INTO QUESTION.

02:38:31.501 --> 02:38:33.203
S. BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'M EARLIER

02:38:33.270 --> 02:38:35.939
PANEL WE HAD DISCUSSION ABOUT.

02:38:36.006 --> 02:38:37.474
WHAT THE COST WAS OF THIS PER OF

02:38:37.541 --> 02:38:39.209
LCF ASKS?

02:38:39.276 --> 02:38:40.277
AND THOSE LITTLE BIT OF

02:38:40.344 --> 02:38:42.579
DISCREPANCY BETWEEN SOME OF THE

02:38:42.646 --> 02:38:43.480
PANELISTS IN TERMS OF THE COST

02:38:43.547 --> 02:38:46.850
BUT FROM YOUR ANALYSIS AND IF

02:38:46.917 --> 02:38:47.985
YOU GET ONE OF THE SLIDES ON IT.

02:38:48.051 --> 02:38:49.953
ORDER THE MAJOR FACTORS THAT ARE

02:38:50.020 --> 02:38:51.588
AFFECTING.

02:38:51.655 --> 02:38:52.890
PRICING THAT YOU'RE SEEING IN

02:38:52.956 --> 02:38:58.495
THE ACTUAL MARKET [inaudible]

02:38:58.562 --> 02:39:09.339
POP THAT.

02:39:09.406 --> 02:39:11.808
OKAY SO THIS.

02:45:46.603 --> 02:45:48.104
EMISSIONS THAT GO WITH THEM ARE

02:45:48.171 --> 02:45:50.273
WE SEEING THIS PROGRAM REDUCE --

02:45:50.340 --> 02:45:51.775
OVER THIRTY THREE MILLION METRIC

02:45:51.841 --> 02:45:54.244
TONS A OF POLLUTANTS TO DATE

02:45:54.311 --> 02:45:55.812
IT'S ALSO RELIEVING PRESSURE

02:45:55.879 --> 02:45:57.947
FROM THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM --

02:45:58.014 --> 02:45:59.649
WITH THOSE --

02:45:59.716 --> 02:46:01.885
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS --

02:46:01.951 --> 02:46:03.520
AND THEREBY SAVING COSTS.

02:46:03.586 --> 02:46:05.455
OBVIOUSLY COST WAS A HUGE FACTOR

02:46:05.522 --> 02:46:07.123
THAT EVERYONE TALKED ABOUT OVER

02:46:07.190 --> 02:46:07.924
AND OVER AGAIN IN THIS

02:46:07.991 --> 02:46:09.526
DISCUSSION --

02:46:09.592 --> 02:46:11.294
FRANKLY I THINK WITH WITH DUE

02:46:11.361 --> 02:46:14.197
RESPECT TO ALL I THINK THE THE

02:46:14.264 --> 02:46:15.865
THE COST ANALYSIS --

02:46:15.932 --> 02:46:18.535
WAS A LITTLE BIT SIMPLISTIC AND

02:46:18.601 --> 02:46:20.103
ARE ALL OF THE COST OF THE L.

02:46:20.170 --> 02:46:22.505
CFS AND IMPUTED IT TO THE GALLON

02:46:22.572 --> 02:46:25.075
SO IT SAID IF THE L. CFS COSTS

02:46:25.141 --> 02:46:25.675
IS A HUNDRED DOLLARS A METRIC

02:46:25.742 --> 02:46:26.509
TON.

02:46:26.576 --> 02:46:28.078
WILL FIGURE OUT WHATTHAT COSTS

02:46:28.144 --> 02:46:30.413
A COT ACROSS THE A GALLON OF

02:46:30.480 --> 02:46:31.948
GASOLINE --

02:46:32.015 --> 02:46:33.883
DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THE FACT --

02:46:33.950 --> 02:46:36.319
THAT CALIFORNIA IS A VERY --

02:46:36.386 --> 02:46:38.355
LEAN OUR MARKET INTERNS ARE

02:46:38.421 --> 02:46:41.191
GASOLINE SUPPLY IN PARTICULAR --

02:46:41.257 --> 02:46:42.158
THOSE THAT HAVE FOLLOWED WHAT'S

02:46:42.225 --> 02:46:44.227
GOING ON IN THE C. C. IN TERMS

02:46:44.294 --> 02:46:47.097
OF THE MASSIVE PRICE SPIKES

02:46:47.163 --> 02:46:49.466
WE'VE SEEN IN GASOLINE ON KNOW

02:46:49.532 --> 02:46:50.400
THAT THOSE RESULT FROM JUST.

02:46:50.467 --> 02:46:52.569
SMALL REFINERY REDUCTION SO I

02:46:52.635 --> 02:46:53.703
THINK WE REALLY OUGHT TO BE --

02:46:53.770 --> 02:46:55.338
THINKING ABOUT THE MARGINAL COST

02:46:55.405 --> 02:46:57.073
OF GASOLINE.

02:46:57.140 --> 02:46:58.742
ALSO THE POINTS --

02:46:58.808 --> 02:47:00.744
THAT NEIL AND JOE BROUGHT UP --

02:47:00.810 --> 02:47:03.446
ABOUT ETHANOL AND BIODIESEL BOTH

02:47:03.513 --> 02:47:05.014
BEING COST SAVERS --

02:47:05.081 --> 02:47:06.449
AND THE FACT THAT OFTENTIMES

02:47:06.516 --> 02:47:08.485
DEAL CFS CREDIT IS NOT JUST

02:47:08.551 --> 02:47:09.319
GOING -- TO

02:47:09.386 --> 02:47:11.955
THE LOW CARBON FUEL IT'S ALSO

02:47:12.021 --> 02:47:13.456
OFTEN BEING SHARED --

02:47:13.523 --> 02:47:15.258
BY THE PETROLEUM DISTRIBUTOR ON

02:47:15.325 --> 02:47:17.160
THAT SIDE OF SO I THINK THAT

02:47:17.227 --> 02:47:18.795
COST ANALYSIS --

02:47:18.862 --> 02:47:20.764
IS SHOULD BE LOOKED AT IN A LOT

02:47:20.830 --> 02:47:22.365
MORE DEPTH ON THE OTHER THING I

02:47:22.432 --> 02:47:24.067
REALLY WANT TO FOCUS IN ON IS

02:47:24.134 --> 02:47:25.168
THAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON THE

02:47:25.235 --> 02:47:26.336
EXPERIENCE TO DATE.

02:47:26.403 --> 02:47:28.638
IN THE PROGRAM --

02:47:28.705 --> 02:47:31.207
WITH THE DE UP THE SLIDES

02:47:31.274 --> 02:47:33.376
PRESENTED HERE ON PAGE TWELVE

02:47:33.443 --> 02:47:34.744
THE COST PER GALLON --

02:47:34.811 --> 02:47:36.279
EVEN WITH THAT SIMPLISTIC

02:47:36.346 --> 02:47:38.181
APPROACH FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN

02:47:38.248 --> 02:47:40.049
WAS FOUR POINT SIX CENTS PER

02:47:40.116 --> 02:47:42.085
GALLON THAT'S ONLY ABOUT A THIRD

02:47:42.152 --> 02:47:42.986
OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR

02:47:43.052 --> 02:47:44.354
CAP AND TRADE PRICES OVER THE

02:47:44.421 --> 02:47:45.422
RACK.

02:47:45.488 --> 02:47:47.524
IT IS ABSOLUTELY NO COST BECAUSE

02:47:47.590 --> 02:47:48.425
FOR ALARM --

02:47:48.491 --> 02:47:50.160
WE'VE SEEN THESE KINDS OF

02:47:50.226 --> 02:47:51.795
CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT'S ABOUT TO

02:47:51.861 --> 02:47:53.696
HAPPEN IN THIS PROGRAM NOW SINCE

02:47:53.763 --> 02:47:56.232
IT STARTED SEVEN YEARS AGO --

02:47:56.299 --> 02:47:58.168
AND SO I WOULD SAY LOOK AT THE

02:47:58.234 --> 02:48:00.570
HISTORY WE HAVE LOOK ALSO AT

02:48:00.637 --> 02:48:02.305
WHAT CARD IS DOING TO ADJUST

02:48:02.372 --> 02:48:04.707
DOWN THESE ARE SHORT YEARS HERE.

02:48:04.774 --> 02:48:06.209
BECAUSE OF CONCERNS BECAUSE THEY

02:48:06.276 --> 02:48:08.178
ARE VERY AWARE OF COST CONCERNS

02:48:08.244 --> 02:48:09.813
AS WELL UP SO I THINK YOU FOR

02:48:09.879 --> 02:48:12.182
YOUR TIME I DO REALLY APPRECIATE

02:48:12.248 --> 02:48:13.483
ALSO THE INTEREST IN.

02:48:13.550 --> 02:48:15.885
A DRIVING IN STATE PRODUCTION --

02:48:15.952 --> 02:48:17.987
DOZER AS AS WAS DISCUSSED THOSE

02:48:18.054 --> 02:48:19.489
ARE SECRET PROBLEMS IN

02:48:19.556 --> 02:48:20.890
PERMITTING PROBLEMS IN NIMBY

02:48:20.957 --> 02:48:21.925
PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE IN

02:48:21.991 --> 02:48:23.726
CALIFORNIA THAT REALLY NEED TO

02:48:23.793 --> 02:48:25.528
BE ADDRESSED TO KEEP MORE THESE

02:48:25.595 --> 02:48:27.163
DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU.

02:48:27.230 --> 02:48:29.132
THANK YOU.

02:48:29.199 --> 02:48:30.800
GOOD EVENING JULIA LEVIN WITH A

02:48:30.867 --> 02:48:31.935
BIO ENERGY ASSOCIATION OF

02:48:32.001 --> 02:48:33.303
CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT MORE

02:48:33.369 --> 02:48:35.305
THAN SEVENTY PUBLIC AGENCIES.

02:48:35.371 --> 02:48:36.639
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND PRIVATE

02:48:36.706 --> 02:48:37.674
COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE

02:48:37.740 --> 02:48:39.342
CONVERTING ORGANIC WASTE TO

02:48:39.409 --> 02:48:40.410
ENERGY.

02:48:40.477 --> 02:48:41.845
AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE LOW

02:48:41.911 --> 02:48:43.146
CARBON FUEL STANDARD WE BELIEVE

02:48:43.213 --> 02:48:44.414
THAT IS PROVIDING A LOT OF

02:48:44.481 --> 02:48:46.483
BENEFITS TO CALIFORNIA INCLUDING

02:48:46.549 --> 02:48:48.051
A LOT OF IN STATE INVESTMENT.

02:48:48.117 --> 02:48:49.619
OF ALL BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF

02:48:49.686 --> 02:48:52.856
SAVINGS AND HEALTH RELATED --

02:48:52.922 --> 02:48:54.390
AT THE AIR POLLUTION RELATED

02:48:54.457 --> 02:48:56.426
HEALTH COSTS IT'S HEDERA.

02:48:56.493 --> 02:48:57.994
HAVING SAID THAT THERE ARE TWO

02:48:58.061 --> 02:48:59.229
MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH THE PROGRAM

02:48:59.295 --> 02:49:00.630
WHICH ACTUALLY HAVE COME OUT IN

02:49:00.697 --> 02:49:01.965
A NUMBER OF THE COMMENTS IN

02:49:02.031 --> 02:49:04.300
PRESENTATIONS TODAY. ONE IS THE

02:49:04.367 --> 02:49:06.002
IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING THE FOCUS

02:49:06.069 --> 02:49:07.871
IN STATE AND TERRACE HOUSE I

02:49:07.937 --> 02:49:09.172
REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS

02:49:09.239 --> 02:49:10.640
ABOUT THAT BECAUSE WE'RE GOING

02:49:10.707 --> 02:49:12.242
TO TALK ABOUT COSTS AND BENEFITS.

02:49:12.308 --> 02:49:14.511
THEY'RE VERY FEW BENEFITS TO

02:49:14.577 --> 02:49:16.212
SUBSIDIZING OUT OF STATE FUELS

02:49:16.279 --> 02:49:18.381
PRODUCTION AND AND NO BENEFITS

02:49:18.448 --> 02:49:19.349
AT THOSE FUELS DON'T ACTUALLY

02:49:19.415 --> 02:49:21.317
MAKE IT. TO CALIFORNIA WHICH

02:49:21.384 --> 02:49:23.786
HAPPENS WITH A LOT OF THE BIO

02:49:23.853 --> 02:49:25.355
MAT THING THAT WE'RE SUBSIDIZING.

02:49:25.421 --> 02:49:27.023
ITS LANDFILL GAS FROM TEXAS OR

02:49:27.090 --> 02:49:29.359
OHIO OR OTHER STATES THAT NEVER

02:49:29.425 --> 02:49:30.260
ACTUALLY IS EVEN DELIVER TO

02:49:30.326 --> 02:49:32.061
CALIFORNIA.

02:49:32.128 --> 02:49:34.464
YOU ALL KNOW FROM YOUR DISTRICTS.

02:49:34.531 --> 02:49:35.732
I'M TERRACE SALAS ASSEMBLYMAN

02:49:35.798 --> 02:49:37.600
MATHIS YOU HAVE A WEALTH OF

02:49:37.667 --> 02:49:39.402
DAIRY FOREST AND AGRICULTURAL

02:49:39.469 --> 02:49:40.436
WASTE THAT WE SHOULD BE

02:49:40.503 --> 02:49:42.171
CONVERTED TO ENERGY INSTEAD OF

02:49:42.238 --> 02:49:43.740
LAND FILLING IT OR BURNING THAT.

02:49:43.806 --> 02:49:45.041
OR LETTING IT GO UP IN A

02:49:45.108 --> 02:49:46.576
CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE

02:49:46.643 --> 02:49:48.077
ASSEMBLYMAN GIBSON HAS TOURED

02:49:48.144 --> 02:49:49.379
ONE OF MY MEMBERS FACILITIES THE

02:49:49.445 --> 02:49:50.847
LOS ANGELES COUNTY SANITATION

02:49:50.914 --> 02:49:51.648
DISTRICTS.

02:49:51.714 --> 02:49:52.382
WHERE THEY'RE NOT ONLY

02:49:52.448 --> 02:49:53.850
CONVERTING WASTE WATER BY A GAS

02:49:53.917 --> 02:49:56.085
TO ENERGY BUT TAKING IN FOOD

02:49:56.152 --> 02:49:56.719
WASTE THAT WOULD OTHERWISE GO TO

02:49:56.786 --> 02:49:57.654
A LANDFILL?

02:49:57.720 --> 02:49:58.755
THESE FACILITIES PROVIDED A LOT

02:49:58.821 --> 02:50:03.126
OF PUBLIC SAFETY BENEFITS THEY

02:50:03.192 --> 02:50:05.161
CAN ALSO PROVIDE JOBS AND A LOT

02:50:05.228 --> 02:50:06.563
OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.

02:50:06.629 --> 02:50:08.831
AS THE FACILITY AT LOS ANGELES

02:50:08.898 --> 02:50:10.266
COUNTY SANITATION DISTRICT US IN

02:50:10.333 --> 02:50:11.467
ALL OF YOUR COMMUNITIES AND

02:50:11.534 --> 02:50:12.835
TREES AROUND THE STATE THAT

02:50:12.902 --> 02:50:14.604
REALLY NEED MORE JOBS.

02:50:14.671 --> 02:50:17.006
WE DON'T GET THOSE BENEFITS WHEN

02:50:17.073 --> 02:50:17.907
THE FUELS ARE PRODUCED OUT OF

02:50:17.974 --> 02:50:20.176
STATE AND WE GET NO BENEFITS IF

02:50:20.243 --> 02:50:21.277
THEY'RE NOT DELIVER TO

02:50:21.344 --> 02:50:22.478
CALIFORNIA SO.

02:50:22.545 --> 02:50:24.113
I DO ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE

02:50:24.180 --> 02:50:26.416
TO LOOK AT HOW. TO FOCUS THE

02:50:26.482 --> 02:50:28.451
LTFS PROGRAM MORE ON FUELS THAT

02:50:28.518 --> 02:50:29.385
ARE PRODUCED AND USED TO

02:50:29.452 --> 02:50:30.520
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY

02:50:30.587 --> 02:50:31.955
WHERE WE MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS

02:50:32.021 --> 02:50:33.489
AND THEN THE COST BENEFIT.

02:50:33.556 --> 02:50:35.658
EQUATION CHANGES SUBSTANTIALLY

02:50:35.725 --> 02:50:37.226
THE OTHER REALLY CRITICAL ISSUE

02:50:37.293 --> 02:50:39.395
IS UNTIL RECENTLY I THINK ONE OF

02:50:39.462 --> 02:50:40.330
THE STRENGTHS OF THE LC OF US

02:50:40.396 --> 02:50:42.065
PROGRAM WAS ITS FUEL NEUTRALITY

02:50:42.131 --> 02:50:43.900
THAT WAS ENTIRELY BASED.

02:50:43.967 --> 02:50:45.635
ON A LIFE CYCLE ANALYSIS OF THE

02:50:45.702 --> 02:50:47.704
CARBON INTENSITY THE AIRBOARD IS

02:50:47.770 --> 02:50:49.172
QUICKLY MOVING AWAY FROM FUEL

02:50:49.238 --> 02:50:50.640
NEUTRALITY AND SOME OF THE

02:50:50.707 --> 02:50:52.008
PROPOSED CHANGES THAT THE ALEJO

02:50:52.075 --> 02:50:53.076
HIGHLIGHTED.

02:50:53.142 --> 02:50:54.978
EMPHASIZE THAT IN THEIR

02:50:55.044 --> 02:50:56.112
ADDITIONAL CHANGES AS WELL.

02:50:56.179 --> 02:50:57.380
THAT WOULD REALLY BENEFIT

02:50:57.447 --> 02:50:58.815
ELECTRIC VEHICLES.

02:50:58.881 --> 02:51:00.717
A AND HURT BIOFUELS WHICH AS

02:51:00.783 --> 02:51:02.118
SEVERAL BECAUSE OF THAT OUR THE

02:51:02.185 --> 02:51:03.753
LION'S SHARE OF ELSE IF US

02:51:03.820 --> 02:51:04.320
PROGRAM.

02:51:04.387 --> 02:51:05.455
ARE AND ALSO HELP TO KEEP THE

02:51:05.521 --> 02:51:07.190
COST DOWN ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE

02:51:07.256 --> 02:51:09.592
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPENSIVE.

02:51:09.659 --> 02:51:11.527
IN TERMS OF THE POUND OF CARBON

02:51:11.594 --> 02:51:13.162
REDUCTION OR A POUND OF AIR

02:51:13.229 --> 02:51:14.397
POLLUTION REDUCTION.

02:51:14.464 --> 02:51:17.000
SO THE PROGRAM NEEDS TO REMAINED

02:51:17.066 --> 02:51:18.401
FUEL NEUTRAL AND FOCUSED ON A

02:51:18.468 --> 02:51:20.637
DIVERSITY OF FUELS TO MAXIMIZE

02:51:20.703 --> 02:51:21.237
THE BENEFITS AND MINIMIZE THE

02:51:21.304 --> 02:51:22.305
COST.

02:51:22.372 --> 02:51:24.974
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU

02:51:25.041 --> 02:51:25.775
APPRECIATE THAT OF THOSE

02:51:25.842 --> 02:51:27.276
COMMENTS AND IF WE LOOK INTO

02:51:27.343 --> 02:51:28.645
SOME OF THOSE THINGS ON THAT

02:51:28.711 --> 02:51:29.846
NOTE JUNE ON ASKING ALL THE HAVE

02:51:29.912 --> 02:51:30.747
TO CALIFORNIA ELECTRIC

02:51:30.813 --> 02:51:32.448
TRANSPORTATION COALITION --

02:51:32.515 --> 02:51:34.050
JUST WANT TO SAY THAT KELLY DC

02:51:34.117 --> 02:51:35.218
IS A LONGTIME SUPPORTER OF THE

02:51:35.284 --> 02:51:36.719
LC A FAST AND I'M NOT GOING TO

02:51:36.786 --> 02:51:37.854
GO INTO ALL THE BENEFITS IF

02:51:37.920 --> 02:51:38.721
YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM

02:51:38.788 --> 02:51:40.490
EVERYBODY ELSE BOTH ECONOMIC AND

02:51:40.556 --> 02:51:42.592
JOBS AND ENVIRONMENTAL BY DO YOU

02:51:42.659 --> 02:51:44.160
JUST WANNA MAKE A PLUG.

02:51:44.227 --> 02:51:44.761
FOR A ELECTRIFICATION OF OUR

02:51:44.827 --> 02:51:47.964
TRANS AFTER ELECTRICITY IS A

02:51:48.031 --> 02:51:49.999
VERY CLEAN TRANSPORTATION FUEL

02:51:50.066 --> 02:51:50.967
REDUCING CLIMATE CHANGE

02:51:51.034 --> 02:51:53.302
POLLUTANTS BY 75%.

02:51:53.369 --> 02:51:54.737
AND TOXIC AIR POLLUTANTS BY OVER

02:51:54.804 --> 02:51:56.039
90%.

02:51:56.105 --> 02:51:57.373
ELECTRICITY GETS CLEANER

02:51:57.440 --> 02:51:59.042
OVERTIME AS A RESULT OF THE

02:51:59.108 --> 02:52:01.778
STATE'S RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS --

02:52:01.844 --> 02:52:02.412
SO --

02:52:02.478 --> 02:52:04.280
ELECTRIC VEHICLES ACTUALLY ARE

02:52:04.347 --> 02:52:05.982
GETTING CLEANER AS THEY AGE.

02:52:06.049 --> 02:52:07.784
A AND KELLY PCS COMPLETED A

02:52:07.850 --> 02:52:09.085
NUMBER OF STUDIES THAT ARE

02:52:09.152 --> 02:52:10.386
AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE

02:52:10.453 --> 02:52:12.355
INDICATING THAT ELECTRICITY GRID

02:52:12.422 --> 02:52:12.922
CAN --

02:52:12.989 --> 02:52:14.390
HANDLE AND ACCOMMODATE THIS

02:52:14.457 --> 02:52:16.592
TRANSITION TO ELECTRIFICATION

02:52:16.659 --> 02:52:18.261
AND IN FACT ELECTRIFICATION IS

02:52:18.327 --> 02:52:19.796
LIKELY TO BENEFIT THE GRANT AND

02:52:19.862 --> 02:52:21.197
ALL ACTRESS CITY USERS

02:52:21.264 --> 02:52:22.532
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT THEY

02:52:22.598 --> 02:52:23.633
DRIVE ANY BE.

02:52:23.700 --> 02:52:25.201
UP THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNIST

02:52:25.268 --> 02:52:27.070
BEACON THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS

02:52:27.136 --> 02:52:29.739
HEARING APPRECIATE.

02:52:29.806 --> 02:52:31.908
HI THERE MARY SELECCIONES AJW WE

02:52:31.974 --> 02:52:34.077
REPRESENT AND MANY DIFFERENT

02:52:34.143 --> 02:52:35.678
ALTERNATIVE FUEL PROVIDERS.

02:52:35.745 --> 02:52:38.548
AND JUST A FEW COMMENTS --

02:52:38.614 --> 02:52:40.883
THE FIRST OF ABOUT THE%

02:52:40.950 --> 02:52:42.418
ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE AVAILABLE

02:52:42.485 --> 02:52:44.353
IN THE MARKETPLACE NOW AS A

02:52:44.420 --> 02:52:46.689
RESULT OF THE L. CFS.

02:52:46.756 --> 02:52:48.057
BECAUSE OF THE LTFS THERE ARE

02:52:48.124 --> 02:52:49.459
NOW ALTERNATIVES IF YOU DON'T

02:52:49.525 --> 02:52:51.828
LIKE THE PRICE OF GASOLINE THEY

02:52:51.894 --> 02:52:53.863
YOU SEE AT THE PUMP. TO DAY YOU

02:52:53.930 --> 02:52:55.765
HAVE CHOICES WHEN WE SOON

02:52:55.832 --> 02:52:57.700
STARTED THE LCF US PROGRAM TEN

02:52:57.767 --> 02:52:59.736
YEARS AGO I WAS A LITTLE BIT

02:52:59.802 --> 02:53:01.404
MORE OF A DREAM AND NAY BEING

02:53:01.471 --> 02:53:03.740
NOT COST EFFECTIVE FOR A LOT OF

02:53:03.806 --> 02:53:05.041
FOLKS NOW YOU'RE SEEING.

02:53:05.108 --> 02:53:07.510
NATURAL GAS ELECTRIC VEHICLES

02:53:07.577 --> 02:53:09.412
USE EVEN SEEN HYDROGEN THERE'S

02:53:09.479 --> 02:53:10.680
SO MANY DIFFERENT THERE THERE'S

02:53:10.747 --> 02:53:12.615
FLEX FUEL VEHICLES THERE ARE SO

02:53:12.682 --> 02:53:15.017
MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF VEHICLES

02:53:15.084 --> 02:53:16.452
NOW THAT ARE AVAILABLE.

02:53:16.519 --> 02:53:18.187
AS A RESULT OF THIS PROGRAM AND

02:53:18.254 --> 02:53:19.989
THAT IS REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING

02:53:20.056 --> 02:53:23.226
TO GET TO IS CHOICE ALTERNATIVES.

02:53:23.292 --> 02:53:25.895
AND SO WHEN I LOOK AT THAT FOR

02:53:25.962 --> 02:53:28.631
SINCE IT'S AT THE TOP OF THE ON

02:53:28.698 --> 02:53:29.966
ON TOP OF THE PRICE OF GASOLINE

02:53:30.032 --> 02:53:31.134
TODAY.

02:53:31.200 --> 02:53:32.935
YEAH THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF

02:53:33.002 --> 02:53:34.303
COST BUT WHAT WE'RE REALLY

02:53:34.370 --> 02:53:35.671
TRYING TO DO IS ADDRESS THAT

02:53:35.738 --> 02:53:38.541
UNDERLYING THREE TO FIVE DOLLARS

02:53:38.608 --> 02:53:40.176
THAT SWINGS THAT WE HAVE NO

02:53:40.243 --> 02:53:41.477
CONTROL OVER.

02:53:41.544 --> 02:53:43.980
BY USING SOME DOMESTIC SOURCES

02:53:44.046 --> 02:53:45.648
OF FUELS AND THAT'S WHAT THE THE

02:53:45.715 --> 02:53:47.350
BOTTOM LINE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING

02:53:47.416 --> 02:53:49.018
TO DO WITH THE PROGRAM AND BY A

02:53:49.085 --> 02:53:50.453
LOT OF THE METRICS THAT WE'VE

02:53:50.520 --> 02:53:51.387
SEEN HERE TODAY WE'VE BEEN

02:53:51.454 --> 02:53:53.923
SUCCESSFUL AT THE OTHER MAJOR

02:53:53.990 --> 02:53:55.024
THING THAT I'D LIKE TO HEAD ON

02:53:55.091 --> 02:53:55.291
IS ABOUT.

02:53:55.358 --> 02:53:57.393
THE DUPLICATION QUESTIONS THAT

02:53:57.460 --> 02:53:59.128
YOU HAD AND THE EARLIER ON THE

02:53:59.195 --> 02:53:59.829
EARLIER PANELS [inaudible]

02:53:59.896 --> 02:54:04.000
AND WE DID A A STUDY WITH

02:54:04.066 --> 02:54:05.835
TELSTAR ACTUALLY.

02:54:05.902 --> 02:54:07.670
I'M SORRY WITH AYE CALLIE T. SEE --

02:54:07.737 --> 02:54:09.238
A FEW YEARS AGO THAT LOOK AT

02:54:09.305 --> 02:54:10.706
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PRICE OF CAP

02:54:10.773 --> 02:54:14.210
AND TRADE ABSENT THE OCI PASS.

02:54:14.277 --> 02:54:15.812
AND IT ESSENTIALLY SPIKES

02:54:15.878 --> 02:54:16.846
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT GETTING

02:54:16.913 --> 02:54:18.848
THAT THAT SIGNIFICANT DRAWDOWN

02:54:18.915 --> 02:54:22.051
OF PA CARBON INTENSITY THROUGH

02:54:22.118 --> 02:54:23.085
THE LCF US THEN.

02:54:23.152 --> 02:54:24.887
IT GOES TO THIS ECONOMY WIDE

02:54:24.954 --> 02:54:26.522
PROGRAM CAPTAIN TRAITS GOING TO

02:54:26.589 --> 02:54:28.791
BECOME MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE

02:54:28.858 --> 02:54:30.626
ECONOMY WIDE.

02:54:30.693 --> 02:54:32.361
BUT THAT THAT IS AVAILABLE ON

02:54:32.428 --> 02:54:34.096
THE CALLIE T. C. WEBSITES I

02:54:34.163 --> 02:54:36.065
ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT THAT.

02:54:36.132 --> 02:54:39.302
AND IN TERMS OF AND WHEN YOU'RE

02:54:39.368 --> 02:54:40.403
TALKING TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS

02:54:40.469 --> 02:54:41.671
BACK HOME AND THEY'RE ASKING

02:54:41.737 --> 02:54:43.139
ABOUT WHY ARE WE DOING THIS

02:54:43.206 --> 02:54:44.373
PROGRAM TWICE.

02:54:44.440 --> 02:54:46.342
THEN I ALWAYS LIKE TO LOOK AT

02:54:46.409 --> 02:54:50.179
THIS AS AN ANALOGY OR A AND I I

02:54:50.246 --> 02:54:51.180
LIKE TO COMPARE THIS TO THEIR

02:54:51.247 --> 02:54:53.816
NOBLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD THIS IS

02:54:53.883 --> 02:54:56.185
THERE AN OVAL PORTFOLIO STANDARD

02:54:56.252 --> 02:54:57.687
FOR THE FUEL SECTOR FOR OUR

02:54:57.753 --> 02:54:59.121
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR.

02:54:59.188 --> 02:55:02.959
WE'RE TRYING TO DIVERSE OF MAURY

02:55:03.025 --> 02:55:05.328
NOBLE CONTENT AND SIEU THAT

02:55:05.394 --> 02:55:07.563
PORTION OF OUR ENERGY MIX THIS

02:55:07.630 --> 02:55:09.899
IS BEATS BUT SET UP CUSTOM

02:55:09.966 --> 02:55:11.434
TAILORED PORTION OF THE MARKET.

02:55:11.500 --> 02:55:13.069
PROGRAM THAT WE NEED TO DRAW

02:55:13.135 --> 02:55:16.672
DOWN THE THAT CARBON BECAUSE IT.

02:55:16.739 --> 02:55:20.676
THANK YOU THANK YOU.

02:55:20.743 --> 02:55:21.911
AYE AYE GOOD AFTERNOON I'M A

02:55:21.978 --> 02:55:24.347
RYAN KENNY WITH CLEAN ENERGY.

02:55:24.413 --> 02:55:26.148
WE ARE A AYE CALIFORNIA SUCCESS

02:55:26.215 --> 02:55:28.084
STORY BECAUSE OF IN PART BECAUSE

02:55:28.150 --> 02:55:30.486
THE L. CFS WERE BASED IN NEWPORT

02:55:30.553 --> 02:55:32.154
BEACH WE HAVE HUTCHEON SIXTY

02:55:32.221 --> 02:55:33.322
FIVE AYE STATIONS ALONG HERE IN

02:55:33.389 --> 02:55:34.323
CALIFORNIA.

02:55:34.390 --> 02:55:36.659
ALL PROVIDE RENEWABLE NATURAL

02:55:36.726 --> 02:55:39.028
GAS OR OR BY METHANE --

02:55:39.095 --> 02:55:40.696
THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE OF THE LCF

02:55:40.763 --> 02:55:42.198
BASS IN THE RAIN CREDITS MEGAN

02:55:42.265 --> 02:55:44.000
IT MADE POSSIBLE TO COMPETE

02:55:44.066 --> 02:55:45.301
EFFECTIVELY WITH DIESEL FUEL.

02:55:45.368 --> 02:55:47.103
AND OF COURSE THAT ALLOWS US TO

02:55:47.169 --> 02:55:48.504
BE PART THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY

02:55:48.571 --> 02:55:50.239
THAT'S A SUCCESS STORY.

02:55:50.306 --> 02:55:51.641
AND ALLOWING US --

02:55:51.707 --> 02:55:53.075
TO REMOVED THIRTY DIESEL FROM

02:55:53.142 --> 02:55:55.912
HIGHWAYS AND I REPLACE IT WITH

02:55:55.978 --> 02:55:56.579
CLEAN --

02:55:56.646 --> 02:55:59.715
FILE FEELS AND HOW WE DO --

02:55:59.782 --> 02:56:02.118
EMPHASIZE THAT THE PROGRAM

02:56:02.184 --> 02:56:04.220
SHOULD REMAIN I FEEL NEUTRAL AND

02:56:04.287 --> 02:56:05.321
YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME --

02:56:05.388 --> 02:56:07.023
EFFORTS TO PICK WINNERS AND

02:56:07.089 --> 02:56:08.658
LOSERS RECENTLY WITH DIFFERENT

02:56:08.724 --> 02:56:11.160
PROGRAMS THE LEGISLATURE I AB

02:56:11.227 --> 02:56:12.495
ONE EIGHTEEN BEING ONE OF THEM --

02:56:12.561 --> 02:56:13.696
BY THE ADMINISTRATION AND WE

02:56:13.763 --> 02:56:15.498
URGE STILL THE LEGISLATURE TO

02:56:15.564 --> 02:56:17.633
PLEASE I MAKE SURE THAT.

02:56:17.700 --> 02:56:18.901
THE POLICIES ARE FUELING

02:56:18.968 --> 02:56:20.703
TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL AYE THERE IS

02:56:20.770 --> 02:56:22.004
ROOM FOR ALL THE TECHNOLOGIES

02:56:22.071 --> 02:56:24.006
AND IS ALSO ROOM FOR A SHORT

02:56:24.073 --> 02:56:25.408
TERM AND LONG TERM STRATEGY.

02:56:25.474 --> 02:56:27.176
AYE WE CAN'T REMOVE THREE DIESEL --

02:56:27.243 --> 02:56:27.843
THROUGH --

02:56:27.910 --> 02:56:29.645
LOW CARBON FEELS TODAY INCLUDING

02:56:29.712 --> 02:56:33.416
EVERYONE AFTER GAS SO THANK YOU.

02:56:33.482 --> 02:56:34.383
GOOD EVENING WILL BARRETT WITH

02:56:34.450 --> 02:56:35.751
THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION

02:56:35.818 --> 02:56:37.353
CALIFORNIA ARE ORGANIZATIONS

02:56:37.420 --> 02:56:38.521
BEEN A STRONG SUPPORTER OF THE

02:56:38.587 --> 02:56:39.422
L. CFS.

02:56:39.488 --> 02:56:41.090
I GOING BACK TO ITS ORIGINS AS

02:56:41.157 --> 02:56:42.591
WELL AS OF THE EXPANSION OF THE

02:56:42.658 --> 02:56:43.392
PROGRAM.

02:56:43.459 --> 02:56:44.226
IN OREGON AS THEY'VE ADOPTED A

02:56:44.293 --> 02:56:46.462
SIMILAR --

02:56:46.529 --> 02:56:47.263
WE DO THIS BECAUSE THE

02:56:47.330 --> 02:56:48.731
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IS THE

02:56:48.798 --> 02:56:49.265
LEADING SOURCE OF CLIMATE

02:56:49.332 --> 02:56:51.667
POLLUTION AND AIR POLLUTION THAT

02:56:51.734 --> 02:56:52.134
HARMS PUBLIC HEALTH IN

02:56:52.201 --> 02:56:53.703
CALIFORNIA --

02:56:53.769 --> 02:56:55.004
THE CHALLENGE VERY POLLUTION ARE

02:56:55.071 --> 02:56:56.005
WELL KNOWN INCREASED ASTHMA

02:56:56.072 --> 02:56:57.873
ATTACKS CHILDHOOD LONG

02:56:57.940 --> 02:56:59.675
DEVELOPMENT PROBLEMS LUNG CANCER

02:56:59.742 --> 02:57:00.209
HEART ATTACKS IN PREMATURE

02:57:00.276 --> 02:57:02.078
DEATHS --

02:57:02.144 --> 02:57:02.979
SOME OF THE RESEARCH THAT THE

02:57:03.045 --> 02:57:04.113
AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION IS

02:57:04.180 --> 02:57:05.815
DONE SHOWS THAT.

02:57:05.881 --> 02:57:06.782
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A LOW

02:57:06.849 --> 02:57:08.484
CARBON FUEL STANDARD IS A

02:57:08.551 --> 02:57:09.251
CRITICAL TOOL IN REDUCING THE

02:57:09.318 --> 02:57:10.086
HARM.

02:57:10.152 --> 02:57:12.088
CAUSED BY OF FOSSIL FUEL USE IN

02:57:12.154 --> 02:57:13.656
THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR.

02:57:13.723 --> 02:57:14.957
ARE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN REPORT

02:57:15.024 --> 02:57:16.792
ON THE ARTIFACTS FOUND THAT --

02:57:16.859 --> 02:57:18.461
WE COULD AVOID IT BILLION

02:57:18.527 --> 02:57:20.629
DOLLARS IN CLIMATE RELATED --

02:57:20.696 --> 02:57:22.398
CHALLENGES EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS

02:57:22.465 --> 02:57:23.799
ROUGHLY AND THEIR POLLUTION

02:57:23.866 --> 02:57:26.235
RELATED HEALTH IMPACTS BY TWENTY

02:57:26.302 --> 02:57:26.869
TWENTY FIVE INCLUDING TENS OF

02:57:26.936 --> 02:57:28.037
THOUSANDS OF VOTED ASTHMA TAXING

02:57:28.104 --> 02:57:29.171
CALIFORNIA.

02:57:29.238 --> 02:57:30.940
OVER SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND

02:57:31.007 --> 02:57:32.541
AFFORDED LOST WORK DAYS IN

02:57:32.608 --> 02:57:33.809
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF CLEANER

02:57:33.876 --> 02:57:34.443
AIR.

02:57:34.510 --> 02:57:35.711
AS A RESULT OF THIS SHOW

02:57:35.778 --> 02:57:37.246
DEFERRED DIVERSIFICATION.

02:57:37.313 --> 02:57:39.849
PROCESS THROUGH THE LC FS SO

02:57:39.915 --> 02:57:41.450
ISN'T PROGRAM MOVES FORWARD WE

02:57:41.517 --> 02:57:43.019
WE LOOK FORWARD TO INCREASE

02:57:43.085 --> 02:57:44.387
SUCCESS WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE

02:57:44.453 --> 02:57:45.855
AIR BE --

02:57:45.921 --> 02:57:46.789
ADDRESSING SOME OF THE

02:57:46.856 --> 02:57:48.057
CHALLENGES AND AND MOVING THE

02:57:48.124 --> 02:57:49.492
PROGRAM FORWARD WITH A STRONGER

02:57:49.558 --> 02:57:50.760
TARGET.

02:57:50.826 --> 02:57:51.394
FOR TWENTY THIRTY REALLY MAKING

02:57:51.460 --> 02:57:52.661
SURE THAT THAT PATH TOWARDS

02:57:52.728 --> 02:57:53.796
ELECTRIFICATION THAT WE BELIEVE

02:57:53.863 --> 02:57:55.398
WE NEED TO MEET OUR CLEANER

02:57:55.464 --> 02:57:56.899
CLIMATE GOALS ACHIEVED.

02:57:56.966 --> 02:57:57.433
AND THAT --

02:57:57.500 --> 02:58:00.302
THESE HEALTH BENEFITS CONTINUE

02:58:00.369 --> 02:58:01.003
TIME SO AS A WHOLE --

02:58:01.070 --> 02:58:03.005
AS A CONCLUSION THE PUBLIC

02:58:03.072 --> 02:58:03.639
HEALTH COMMUNITY CALIFORNIA HAS
