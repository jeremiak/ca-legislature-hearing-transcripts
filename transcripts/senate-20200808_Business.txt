I'VE REVIEWED THE CONSENT CALENDAR. A MOMENT AGO EITHER QUITE. HI I HEARD A MOTION FROM SENATOR ARE TO LEAD ON THIS A CONSENT CALENDAR. AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK THE SECRETARY TO CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR IS DO YOU PASSED A SENATE APPROPRIATIONS GLAZER HI. GLAZER AYE CHANGE. CHANG I ARCHULETA. TO I'D DAHLE. DOT ON A GALGIANI. HELLO FIVE HELLO HI. NINE THIS LEYVA I LEYVA AYE EACH MAN. WELL WELL I'D- RIGHT THE BILL HAS AN VOTES TO GET OUT BUT WE'RE TO PUT IT ON CALL FOR ABSENT. FOLLOW ALSO SAY IS WITH THE OUR AGE. IT ENDED TO THINKING MY VOICE CENTER CHIANG I TO THANK ALSO K. WILL YOU. THEY WERE. AT HIS WORKS CLOSELY OUR TEAM ON THAT THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US. THANK YOU KAYLA. ALL RIGHT THAT THE FIRST BILL THAT WE'RE TO FORMALLY HEAR TODAY'S. BILL SEVENTY. ON BEHALF OF THE SELLING BERMAN. AND SO I IT SENATOR HILL YOU WERE TO BE PER THAT BILL. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN HERE HAVE A THAT THAT'S EVEN BETTER. SIX ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN THANK YOU FOR COMING IN WE WILL BE YOUR TESTING THIS MORE. THANK YOU MISS CHAIR THERE IS MANY GOOD YOU THAT I DECIDED BETTER BE HERE PERSON I WOULD LIKE A STAR BY THINKING THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFFER YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL. I'M GOING TO GOING TO SOME OF THE- OF AB SO BUT THERE'S MAIN BEFORE US TODAY. THE QUESTION IS IF A TEN YEAR. WITH YOUR FOR PROFIT OWNER. FOR THE TO PER CORE SERVICE LIKE IN. IN FINANCE AID. IN EXCHANGE FOR TWO PER OF YOUR RED. IS EVER. FOR SO. FROM THE PRIOR FOR PROFIT. ARE YOU REALLY INTO. AB SEVENTY WHICH IS VERY SIMILAR TO LEGISLATION PASSED BY THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR ON A SEVEN TO ZERO VOTE. WOULD PREVENT COVERT FOR PROFIT COLLEGES FROM EVADING STATE OVERSIGHT. SPECIFICALLY IT WOULD REQUIRE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO VERIFY WHETHER AN INSTITUTION THAT CLAIMS TO BE A NONPROFIT COLLEGE. AND THEREFORE IS EXEMPT FROM STATE OVERSIGHT IS ACTUALLY OPERATING AS A NONPROFIT. THAT A CLIENT ENFORCEMENT OF NONPROFIT STATUS BY THE IRS. IS ALLOWING SOME FOR PROFIT COLLEGES HE'S COMPLICATED FINANCIAL SCHEMES AND SHELL CORPORATIONS TO LAY CLAIM TO NONPROFIT STATUS. AS A RESULT FROM FOR PROFIT COLLEGES ARE WRAPPING THEMSELVES IN A NONPROFIT LABEL MISLEADING STUDENTS AND DODGING APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT. THIS ISSUE HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY TIME SENSITIVE DUE TO THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND THE ECONOMIC RECESSION MANY STUDENTS ARE SEEKING ADDITIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING SPECIFICALLY ONLINE. CALIFORNIA MUST STEP IN TO PROTECT OUR STUDENTS AND ENSURE THAT APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT REMAINS IF A COVERT FOR PROFIT SCHOOL IS PRETENDING TO BE A NONPROFIT WITH INDEPENDENCE FROM ITS PRIOR OWNER. WE HAVE HAD EXTENSIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH ASHFORD UNIVERSITY REGARDING THEIR CONCERNS LAST YEAR THEY CAME TO US REQUESTING AN APPEALS PROCESS SO WE ADDED AN APPEALS PROCESS INTO THE BILL. THIS YEAR ASHFORD REMAINS OPPOSED NOW DUE TO A CLAUSE REGARDING THE LENGTH OF THE CONTRACT THAT THE NEW NONPROFIT CAN HAVE WITH ITS PRIOR FOR PROFIT OWNER. IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO ASHFORD'S CONCERNS WE DOUBLE THE LENGTH TO THREE YEARS BUT THAT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEM. THIS CRITICAL PROVISION WOULD ENSURE THAT A NONPROFIT BOARDS MANAGEMENT CHOICES ARE BEING MADE AS A FULLY INDEPENDENT DECISION MAKER. NOT AFTER ALREADY BEING COMMITTED LONG TERM TO A CONTRACT WITH THEIR PRIOR OWNERS. SO TO COME BACK TO IT IF A TEN YEAR CONTRACT WITH YOUR PRIOR FOR PROFIT OWNER FOR THEM TO PROVIDE CORE SERVICES LIKE ENROLLMENT AND FINANCIAL AID IN EXCHANGE 420% OF YOUR REVENUE. IS A REQUIREMENT OF THE SEPARATION FROM THEM. ARE YOU REALLY INDEPENDENT. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT NOTE THAT EIGHTY SEVENTY DOES NOT PREVENT A NONPROFIT INSTITUTION FROM RENEWING THE CONTRACT WITH THEIR PRIOR FOR PROFIT OWNER AS OFTEN AS IT WANTS TO. AND IT DOES NOT LIMIT THE LENGTH OF CONTRACTS WITH ANY OTHER ENTITY. EXCEPT FOR THEIR FORMER OWNERS. I ALSO WANT TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT UNDER MY BILL. IF AN ENTITY LIKE ASHFORD ONCE YOU ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH THEIR PRIOR FOR PROFIT OWNER FOR LONGER THAN THREE YEARS THEY CAN DO THAT. THEY WILL JUST CONTINUE TO OPERATE UNDER THE OVERSIGHT OF THE BUREAU OF PRIVATE POST SECONDARY EDUCATION LIKE THEY CURRENTLY DO. IT'S COMPLETELY UP TO THEM. AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THE BILL. AND TO TESTIFY TODAY IS BOB SHIREMAN- FROM THE CENTURY FOUNDATION I DON'T KNOW ABOUT TESTIFYING OR- MAYBE JUST AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS WELL ABOVE ANSWER THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY DUE TO- CONSTRAINTS REGARDING THE LENGTH OF THE HEARINGS AND TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS AS WELL AS CLEANING PROTOCOLS- THE COMMITTEE CHAIRS ARE ALLOWED DO INSTITUTO AYE LIMITS ON TESTIMONY. SO OUR PRACTICE AT THAT GOING FORWARD TODAY- WILL BE THE SITE WILL BE DIFFERENT FOR THREE MINUTES FOR TESTING IN SUPPORT. THREE MINUTES IN TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION. ALL OTHERS WHO WISH TO TESTIFY MUST LIMIT THEIR COMMENTS TO THEIR NAME. AFFILIATION AND POSITION ON THE MEASURE. SO FIRST I'D LIKE TO WELCOME UP BUT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN SEP FIRST WITNESS BOB SHIREMAN. CF GOING TO BE SPEAKING TO US OF REMOTELY. R. HERE IN THE CHAMBES. I BELIEVE HIS REMOTE.

INSTEAD UNDER THE ANNOUNCED PLANNED THERE IS ON A GLOBAL WHAT A CHOIR ASHER FOR ONE DOLLAR THEN YOU PAY YOU KNOW BE ASHFORD'S. OWNER IT TAKES TO. THE SCHOOL PLUS NINETY AND A HALF PERCENT OF TUITION. IT'S NOT MORE. THE ONE THAT PRETTY CRITICAL. ABC SAYS THAT IF A SCHOOL IS GOING TO BE EXEMPT FROM YOUR OVERSEE AS A NON OR PUBLIC INSTEAD. YES IT MUST A TO. STANDARD FOR IT MEANS TO BE ABLE TO. NONPROFIT OR PUMP. THE BILL DOES NOT PER. PROHIBIT ANY TYPE OF BUSINESS ARRANGE ARE JUST. IT IS ONLY ABOUT ZERO OVERSEE HI DON'T NEEDED YOU ABOUT THIS CAN OF THE FOR PROFIT. CAL EXAMS NON AND PUBLIC AND- BECAUSE WAY THEY CAN. AS BEEN EXTRA AFTER IN PROTECT STOOD AND CALL. A FOUR PER CONVERT TO NOT. IS FOR STUDENTS IN CONSENT. BUT GALA NEEDS MAKE SURE THAT ANY.

BUT BY THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA IS PUTTING COMPLETELY NEW BOARD IN PLACE TO OVERSEE THE NEW ENTITY. THE REASON WE HAVE ISSUES WITH THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT IS THAT. IS THAT AS THE SPONSORS WILL TELL YOU THAT THESE CONTRACTS GENERALLY RUN CONSIDERABLY LONGER THAN THREE YEARS. WHAT GOES INTO PLACES SALVIO IS BEING BEEN GO SHE ATION IS THAT WE WILL BE PROVIDING FOR THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. RECRUITING ADMINISTERING FINANCIAL AID COUNSELING INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT AND ACADEMIC SUPPORT SO THEY WILL BE THE INFRASTRUCTURE.

OR THAT THE THEY HAVE NOT EXECUTED ANY AGREEMENTS FOR GOODS OR SERVICES EXCEEDING THE FAIR VALUE OF GOODS OR SERVICES. OR THAT ALL CORE FUNCTIONS OF THE NONPROFIT INSTITUTION ARE CONDUCTED BY OR UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE NONPROFIT INSTITUTION WHICH WILL BE THE INDEPENDENT BOARD THAT IS BEING ESTABLISHED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA. THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE A C. O. OF A SOVIET- SITTING ON THE BOARD LIKE WAS POINTED OUT THE GRAND CANYON AND THE ANALYSIS ARE NOT GOING TO BE ANY OF THAT INTERPLAY. THE ISSUE REALLY COMES DOWN TO THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT. ESSENTIALLY WE WOULD SIGN A CONTRACT AND SHORTLY THEREAFTER HAVE TO BE RENEGOTIATING IT. BECAUSE OF THE TERM IS SO SHORT.

AND IT IS ALSO COUNCIL RECEIVING FROM OUR PARLIAMENTARIANS AS WELL. THAT WE'VE TRIED OUR BEST TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY FURTHER OPPONENTS TO THIS BILL SO WE COULD HAVE THEM PARTICIPATE. BUT GIVEN THAT YOU THINK WE HAVE EXHAUSTED THAT- WE'RE GONNA MAKE BRING HER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE HERE IN THE CHAMBER. AND I WANT TO ASK IF THERE'S MEMBERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO ASK QUESTIONS I SAY DODD. FIRST UP. BETTER TO. YES FIRST OF ALL MR CHAIR I'D LIKE TO. THE AUTHOR SOMEONE BERMAN FOR BRINGING BILL FORWARD THAT- YOU KNOW SEEKS TO PROTECT STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I THINK EXAMPLES OF GRAND CANYON UNIVERSITY. WERE CONTRACT PROVISIONS ALLOW FOR- MEMBERS OF THE INDEPENDENT BOARD THE INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT BOARD TO BE ON THE- THE PROFIT BOARD- ARE EGREGIOUS SAYS MR SHARMAN SAID DURING HIS TESTIMONY. CONVERSION THE NONPROFIT ARE GOOD. AND I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT BUT THEY DO HAVE TO BE. MODERATE AND REGULATED IN THIS BILL DOES THAT. AND I VOTED FOR THIS BILL LAST YEAR. BUT THIS YEAR WITH THIS THREE YEAR PROVISION JUST TOTALLY IGNORES ANY BUSINESS. SOUND BUSINESS DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE BY THE NONPROFIT IF THE NONPROFIT IS INDEPENDENT FROM. THE FOR PROFIT BOARD AS IN THE CASE OF A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY. I DON'T SEE THERE'S ANY REASON TO NOT ALLOW THE PUBLIC UNIVERSITY TO HAVE AN EXEMPTION. FROM THIS- ONEROUS REQUIREMENT FOR THEM IS I DON'T THINK IT'S AN ONEROUS REQUIREMENT- YOU KNOW IN IN OTHER CASES SO I WOULD PROPOSE AN AMENDMENT. THAT WE CAN LEAVE THE THREE YEAR REQUIREMENT IN PLACE. IT'LL IN ANY WOULD SAY THIS SECTION DOES NOT APPLY TO A NONPROFIT INSTITUTION. THE PREVIOUSLY OP AS A FOR PROFIT INSTITUTION THAT IS OWNED BY OR CONTROLLED BY A PUBLIC INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING. SO IN THIS CASE WHETHER IT'S UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA UNIVERSITY. OF COLORADO FLORIDA STATE FLOOR A AND M. A PUBLIC IS TO CAN BUY ONE OF THESE COMPANIES. AND NOT THIS PROVISION WOULD NOT APPLY ANYBODY ELSE IT WOULD APPLY. SO I WOULD OFFER THAT AMENDMENT- MISTER CHAIR OF CASES OUT THANK YOU SENATOR JOHN I'M GONNA GIVE THAT FAMILY MEMBER BERMAN AN OPPORTUNITY TO REPLY BUT IF IT'S ON THIS POINT I WANT TO INVITE OTHER SENATORS WHO I THINK OF SPEAK ON THIS CENTER. GALGIANI ON THE ISSUE THE MR RAISING THANKING US CHAIR I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A- AT THAT. IS BE SAM. ANY I WAS PRETTY. AT THIS DOES NOT APPLY PLAN NOT. IN THAT PREVIOUS I. AS A FOR PROFIT INSTITUTION AS LONG AS IT IS NOT CONTENT IS LONG AS IT IS OWNED BY OR CONTROLLED BY A PUBLIC INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION. OKAY I HAVEN'T I'M NOT KNOWLEDGE IN MOTIONS AT THE MOMENT AS WE CONTINUE OUR CONVERSATION SO I WANT TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER MEMBER WHO HAS SOMETHING THEY LIKE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE CONVERSATION WE'RE GONNA GIVE MISTER BERMAN AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND AND WE CAN. SEE IF THERE'S THAT APPROPRIATE MOTION TO ENTERTAIN ANY OTHER SENATOR WHICH TO WEIGH IN ON THIS DISCUSSION. C. NOT ALL GO TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO THE CONCERNS THAT YOU'VE HEARD. YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND A I. CENTER DOT AND I HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION- YESTERDAY AND- HE CALLED ME ABOUT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE THE HEARING- TO LET ME KNOW THAT HE HAD A PROPOSED AMENDMENT THAT I HAVEN'T. HAD A CHANCE TO SEE IN PERSON- SO IT'S KIND OF HARD TO. YOU KNOW THESE ARE THE THESE ARE INCREDIBLY NUANCED. LANGUAGE AND ARGUMENTS THAT CAN HAVE A BIG IMPACT A PENDING ON WHAT THE WORDING ACTUALLY IS SO IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THIS AMENDMENT BECAUSE- I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY SEEN IT AND- YEAH I DON'T KNOW WHAT. ALSO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF MY CREATE BUT I DO JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS BILL. IS TRYING TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS- AND SO IF IN THIS INSTANCE AS WE HEARD FROM FROM MISTER MILLER- IT IS- VIDEO A- FOR PROFIT COMPANY THAT OWNS ASK FOR UNIVERSITY A PRIVATE FOR PROFIT COLLEGE. YEAR ARRANGEMENT. WITH ANYBODY- OF. PUBLIC UNIVERSITY FROM ARIZONA OR MISSISSIPPI- TO DO WITH THE CORE FUNCTIONS. MARKETING ENROLLMENT. FINANCIAL AID. A LOT OF THE CORE FUNCTIONS THAT FRANKLY IS OVER YOU IS CURRENTLY BEING SUED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR BECAUSE- IT OPENS UP CALIFORNIANS. TO PREDATORY PRACTICES. AND THAT PRIVATE FOR PROFIT COMPANY IN THIS CASE IS OVER YO. GETS A CERTAIN PER. OF THAT REVENUE SO THEY THEY HAVE EVERY INCENTIVE. TO POSSIBLY USE PREDATORY PRACTICES. ON CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. I BELIEVE THAT THE AMENDMENT THAT THE GOOD SANDERS OFFERING. WHAT EXAMS. THAT PRIVATE FOR PROFIT AND THAT NEW TECHNICALLY NONPROFIT. FROM ANY CALIFORNIA OVERSIGHT. AND THAT CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WOULD HAVE NOWHERE TO GO. IF THEY FELT LIKE THEY WERE BEING TRICKED. INTO IN ROLE PLAYING BASED ON MISREPRESENTATIONS AND FALSE PRACTICES. THAT ARE BEING MADE. FEDERAL BEING MADE BY THAT PRIVATE FOR PROFIT RIGHT BECAUSE- THE ONES WHO ARE DOING THAT WORK. IT'S NOT THE PRIVATE NONPROFIT THAT'S DOING THAT WORK. YEAH AND SO WHAT MY BILL WANTS TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT. IF THAT'S THE CASE IF. THE UNIVERSITY WANTS TO DO THAT. THERE'S AN AVENUE FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS TO GO TO. WITH CONCERNS BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. MY CONCERN IS THAT IF THAT AMENITIES ADDED IN. THAT THAT WOULD NO LONGER BE THE CASE THERE WOULD BE NO WEARING CALIFORNIA FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. TO GO WITH CONCERNS THAT THEY HAVE SO- I WORRY THAT. MASSIVE LOOPHOLE THAT WOULD IT REALLY PUT CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AT RISK. CALIFORNIA STUDENTS OF OUR- IT COULD BE USED BY PRIME FOR COLLEGES AND WE ALL ALL THE- FOR CURRENT THE OTHER. THANK SO I'M OPEN I'M DEFINITELY OPEN TO CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO SAY YES I ACCEPT SOMETHING WHEN I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY SEEN IT- AND WAS ONLY INFORMED THAT THIS MIGHT HAPPEN AT NINE FIFTY FIVE. THIS MORNING. ALRIGHT I EITHER EITHER AT CENTER LEYVA PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WOULD JUST LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. ANY OTHER CENTER WISHING TO SHARE THEIR THOUGHTS. DODD THANK YOU. YET THE GOOD ASSEMBLY MEN- JUST SAID THAT THAT THE AG HAS INVESTIGATION- YOU KNOW AGAINST THIS UNIVERSITY OR- THAT SHOWS YOU THAT THE PROCESS IS WORKING. I THINK IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THERE ARE REGULATORY OVER OVERSIGHT THAT IS. THAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW THAT MAY BE THERE I DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT IS RESULTED THERE AS TO WHY BUT NEVER THE LESS- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING FROM- MISTER MILLER- THAT THIS AMENDMENT WAS PROPOSED TO THE AUTHOR OR THE SPONSOR I DON'T KNOW WHICH- EARLIER THIS WEEK ON MONDAY. THE OTHER SENATOR WHICH TO WEIGH IN ON THIS. ALL RIGHT OF CENTER HILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND IT AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL AS WRITTEN AND- AS OF SUGGESTED BROUGHT TO US I THINK THE ISSUES THAT ARE RAISED ARE OR PRETEND SERIOUS AND CAN BE VERY SERIOUS IF WE'RE NOT PAYING THE STRICTEST AMOUNT OF ATTENTION ONE AND HAVE THE SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE STUDENTS- MY CONCERN IS THAT- WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A NON PROFIT- OR FOR A- A FOR PROFIT CORPORATION TO. HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FINANCIAL INTERESTS CONTROL AND BENEFIT DERIVED FROM THEIR AFFILIATION WITH A NON PROFIT AND I THINK THIS WILL OF CLOTHES THAT THE THAT THERE WAS A THIS IS SURELY A LOOPHOLE BUT FORTUNE PARAMETERS AROUND IT AND MAKE IT TO A MUCH BETTER AND A CLEANER OPERATION FOR THE PROTECTION OF STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA'S ALL SUPPORT THE ORIGINAL MEASURES. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER. SENATORS WISHING TO WEAR. ALL RIGHT SEE NINE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN SO YOU'VE HEARD THE CONCERNS BY NUMBER OF MEMBERS HERE ABOUT- THIS THIS- THE BILL IT AS AS WRITTEN ARE THERE ANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU TO- I GUESS I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND YOUR SENSITIVITY. TO THE CONCERNS THAT ARE BEING RAISED OBVIOUSLY UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA IS A GREAT PUBLIC INSTITUTION AND OBVIOUSLY NO ONE HERE THE COMMITTEE. WANTS TO SEE PREDATORY PRACTICES UNDERTAKEN CERTAINLY ARE. PARENTS ARE LAW THAT THAT- HAVE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THOSE PRACTICES WHERE THEY DO OCCUR UNDER THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES OR EVEN UNDER YOUR BILL. SO CAN YOU SPARE CLOTHES CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE RIVER THE NEED. TO HAVE THAT PARTICULAR. YEAR LIMITATION AND WHETHER YOU'RE OPEN TO BECAUSE I YOU KNOW DID DID. OBVIOUSLY LIKE YOU SEE YOUR BILL MOVE FORWARD. BUT IT SEEMS THAT THERE'S A NUMBER OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME PROTECTION FOR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING LIKE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA. WE HAVE A POINT YES WE'RE AT THAT POINT YES SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND- I AM DEFINITELY OPEN TO ADDITIONAL- IMPROVEMENTS TO THE BILL- YOU KNOW IF IT WERE TO MAKE IT OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY MY CONCERN IS THAT. WE ARE YOU KNOW SAYING THAT WE'RE CREATING AN INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT. BUT THEN WE'RE SADDLING IT WITH LONG TERM FIFTEEN YEAR OR TEN YEAR AGREEMENTS. THAT THEY DID THAT THIS INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT BOARD WON'T HAVE A CHANCE TO WEIGH IN ON OR RE EVALUATE. UNTIL TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS DOWN THE ROAD- AND SO IT'S NOT REALLY INDEPENDENT. IF AS PART OF BECOMING AN INDEPENDENT ORGANIZATION YOU ALREADY HAVE THESE LONG TERM CONTRACTS THAT IT'S FORCED TO BE A PART OF- THE SO I AM DEFINITELY OPEN TO IT BUT BUT I DEFINITELY AGREE THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA IS A VERY REPUTABLE. INSTITUTION AND- YOU KNOW THAT THAT PROVIDES SOME AMOUNT OF SOLACE- SO I'M I'M HAPPY TO IT TO DIG INTO THAT AND YOU CAN LOOK AT THAT FURTHER AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO- TO. TO CREATE YOU KNOW A LITTLE- READ MORE ALLOWANCES IN THAT SITUATION. JUST SO LONG AS IT DOESN'T BLAST A HUGE LOOPHOLE IN THIS- AND REALLY ALLOW PRIVATE FOR PROFITS TO CONTINUE DOING EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE DOING. BUT NOW WITHOUT ANY SORT OF STATE OVERSIGHT BROUGHT BY THE BUREAU OF PRIVATE POST SECONDARY EDUCATION SO IT'S A BALANCE I'M OPEN TO IT- YOU KNOW WHAT IT WOULD. ENJOY HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS- WITH THE- OPPONENTS AND OTHER SENATORS THAT HAVE CONCERNS- IF THE BILL MAKES IT OUT TODAY. VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN. A FREE WORK ON THIS ISSUE. I'M NOT. I GET A COURTESY VOTE FOR ME TODAY. BUT WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT YOU DO WORK TO- FIND A BETTER BALANCE OF THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE US. WITH THAT I'M GONNA RECOGNIZE MOTION FROM CENTER. LEYVA TO MOVE THE BILL. I IS IT WITHOUT AMENDMENTS. CONSULTANT IS THAT WITHOUT AMENDMENTS TO IT SO TO PASS- TO APPROPRIATIONS WOULD BE THE MOTION IS THAT CORRECT. I CAN'T HEAR YOU. RIGHT RIGHT. GOT IT WELL FUN RECOGNIZE EMOTIONS. THAT I'M I'VE I'VE ALREADY RECOGNIZE AT THE CENTER WILL BECAUSE THERE'S SOME POINT I HAVE A POINT OF ORDER WE HAD A PROPOSED AMENDMENT I KNOW IT'S BEEN QUITE AWHILE SINCE WE'VE DONE AND THEN IT'S A COMMITTEES AND I PERSONALLY DON'T LIKE TO DO- THE MINUTES IN COMMITTEES BUT- BOAT THEY'RE WHAT THEY'RE THERE WAS A MOTION MADE SO I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO TAKE THAT UP. AND I JUST WANNA MAKE COMMENTS JUST BILL AND I HAVE THE MOST AMOUNT RESPECT FOR YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- BUT I REPRESENT NINE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE. AND I'M SUPPOSED TO BE THEIR VOICE UP HERE. AND WE GOT UP HERE THAN COLD IT STRUCK AND THEN WE WERE TOLD. YOU NEED TO PARE DOWN YOUR LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE WHICH I DID. AND WE GOT TWENTY BILLS BEFORE US TODAY A LOT OF THESE BILLS DO NOT HIT THE BUCKET LIST THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING. AND I RESENT THAT SOME SO I'M NOT GOING TO. PENALIZE ANY AUTHOR BECAUSE FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY ARE ABLE TO GET GET THEIR BILL BEFORE US TODAY BUT- MY CONSTITUENTS HAVE BEEN DISENFRANCHISED THIS YEAR. AND I THINK IF WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS I THINK WE SHOULD GO THROUGH IT FULLY COMPLETELY. AND WITH AS MUCH TRANSPARENCY AS POSSIBLE THERE'S A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN THIS BUILDING AND IN THIS YEAR'S BEEN THE WORST YEAR EVER AND I'M REALLY FRUSTRATED AND NOT A YOU I KNOW THAT YOU HAD CARE DOWN THE BILL PACKAGE. AND SOMEHOW IT GOT EXPANDED BUT- I THINK IF WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH THIS LET'S GO THROUGH THIS CORRECTLY AND I HAVE SEEN ABOUT MEMBERS PROPOSE MANY TIMES.

AT THIS TIME PLEASE. THANK YOU FOR THAT I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION I STILL HAVEN'T ACTUALLY SEEN THE WORDS OF THE AMENDMENT I OBVIOUSLY HEARD THEM- AND YOU KNOW I THINK. I STILL WANT THE BILL TO MOVE FORWARD- IT'S A LITTLE HARD NOT KNOWING- DIE I TO GET CLARIFICATION FOR MY STAFF THAT. THE OPPOSITION HAS NEVER SENT US THIS LANGUAGE- SO WE DID NOT ACTUALLY GET INTO FIVE MINUTES BEFORE THE HEARING- BITES- YOU KNOW IF THAT'S THE ONLY. GAME IN TOWN THAT'S THE GAME WILL PLAY. THANK YOU SIR A CENTER PAN BACK TO YOU SO I DO WANT TO. I GUESS THIS IS A ANALYSTS QUESTION PROCEDURE OR PRECEDENCE OR WHATEVER- YOU KNOW WE ARE. REQUESTING AN AMENDMENTS HERE FROM THE COMMITTEE- WELL MAYBE A MAJORITY OF COMMITTEE WILL BE FAVORABLE TO THIS- YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALSO MADE THE TIME FOR CONSIDERATION AND I GUESS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I WOULD HAVE IS THAT. YES THE AUTHOR YOU KNOW WHO BASICALLY VOTED OUT WITH THE AMENDMENT AND YOU KNOW THE AUTHOR LOOKS AT IT AND IT GOES THROUGH FURTHER IN THE COMMITTEE PROCESS. THROUGH THROUGH ITS FURTHER THROUGH THE PROCESS AND UP ON THE FLOOR WITHOUT THIS AMENDMENT WOULD THAT BE CONSIDERED A JAILBREAK. OR EIGHT DOLLARS IT JUST SIMPLY FREE FOR ALL OF US YOU KNOW POLICY THOSE OF US WHO WANT IT CAN JUST NOT VOTE FOR ON THE FLOOR BUT SHOWS UP ABOUT I JUST WANT TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT THE PROCEDURES BECAUSE THIS IS A LITTLE UNUSUAL. THE ONLY IT'S A REQUEST FROM THE CHAIRED IT'S BEEN YOU KNOW PROPOSED THE COMMITTEE ETCETERA SO I JUST WANT TO. DEFINE WHAT THE PARAMETERS ARE SINCE WE ARE BASICALLY I MEAN MAYBE HE'S GOTTEN SOME VERSION OF IT BEFORE BUT SOURCE BRING IT ON THE AUTHOR HERE AND ON THE COMMITTEE AND CERTAINLY IT'S THAT THE OFFER AT THE COMMITTEE CAN I MEAN WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO. REQUEST AMENDMENTS OF THE AUTHOR BUT I JUST WANT TO. GET A SENSE OF WHAT DOES THIS MEAN- IF IT PASSES WITH THIS PARTICULAR COMMITTEE AMENDMENT AND IT'S POSSIBLE IT COULD SHOW UP WITH. YOU KNOW HE COULD BE. DEAD UNDER FURTHER CONSIDERATION IT'S GOING TO APPROPRIATIONS ARE. BE AMENDED BACKED OUT ON THE FLOOR. THANK YOU CENTER PANIC. I'M GONNA TRY AN EXPLANATION BUT- I'M SURE IT'LL BE DOUBLE CHECKED BY MY FRIENDS TO MAKE SURE I'M- EXPLAINING IT CORRECTLY. SO FIRST THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN TO GET WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO NOT MOVE HIS BILL ANY FURTHER BASED ON THE ACTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE TODAY. SO HE'S NOT HAPPY WITH WHAT'S- BEEN ADOPTED THAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE A CHOICE AND NOBODY WOULD INTERFERE WITH THAT CHOICE. IF IN THE PROCESS AS IT GOES FORWARD TO THE FLOOR WHICH IS THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. THE CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE BILL. THAT WOULD BE WITHIN THE FORTY OF THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE TO MAKE. WHATEVER CHANGES THEY THOUGHT APPROPRIATE. OR NOT. OR NOT MOVE THE BILL- ANY FURTHER. AND SO I DON'T I WOULDN'T INTERPRET. OUR ACTION TODAY TO BE BINDING ACTION. BUT WE HAVE TO EVALUATE THE BILL AS IT WOULD FORWARD CERTAINLY THEY CAME TO THE FLOOR. YOU BE IN A POSITION TO EVALUATE IT MAKE A JUDGMENT. THEY JUST DOUBLE CHECK THAT. AND IT HAS BEEN CLARIFIED BY OUR WONDERFUL. ASSISTANT CLERK THAT. IF THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. THRUPP THE LANGUAGE OF THE AMENDMENT AS BEFORE US TODAY THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED- SOMETHING THAT WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE. BY THE RULES OF THE HOUSE. AND WOULD NOT THAT BE ALLOWED IS WHAT I FIND TOLD. OKAY CENTER CANNOT RESOLVE YOUR QUESTIONS. I GUESS THE ONE OTHER QUESTION I WOULD HAVE IS I REALIZE WE SORT OF WROTE THE AMENDMENT ON THE FLY YOU MENTION LIKE IT DOESN'T REFER TO WHICH SECTION IT CETERA DO WE NEED TO FINE TUNE THIS LANGUAGE BEFORE CENTER OFFICE OKAY FOR APPROPRIATIONS TO DO THAT. I JUST DON'T. BASICALLY ON BE SURE THAT THE AMENDMENT IS VERY CLEAR AS TO WHICH YOU KNOW THAT IF. WE GOT THE CONCEPT THAT THAT IT'S THE DETAILS RIGHT IS REFERRING TO THE RIGHT SECTIONS LANCE'S REFERS TO WHAT SECTION WOULD YOU KNOW DO WE KNOW WHICH ONE IT IS. SO FORTH SO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER. AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO GET MORE OF OUR DISCUSSION TIME ON THIS BUT WHATEVER WE- DO. WE SHOULD AFFORD SOMETIME TO WORK THIS OUT AND BRING THE BILL BACK FOR A FINAL VOTE. WHEN THAT'S WHEN THOSE SIR DETAILS WORKED OUT AND PERHAPS- THE PROPOSAL OF THE MEMORY HAS A WORKED OUT NOW I DON'T KNOW ICDS ARE GALGIANI OTHER HAND UP. THE SENATOR PAT I'VE INFORMED THAT UNDER OUR PRACTICES HERE IN THE SENATE- NUMBER ONE. I HAVE BEEN GIVEN GUIDANCE FIRE CHIEF CONSULTANT THAT SHE'S AWARE OF WHERE THIS OUR- AMENDMENT WOULD. BE PLACED IN THE BILL BUT AS IT ADDED PROTECTION. EVERY MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE IS. IN A POSITION TO REVIEW THIS AMENDMENT WHEN IT IS WRITTEN UP BY LECH COUNCIL. TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT. HAS TRANSPIRED TO RAISE ANY ANY ISSUES ABOUT IT- AS IT GOES FORWARD TODAY IN THIS CASE TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. OKAY ALL RIGHT SENATOR GALGIANI. UP TO CLARIFY IT WOULD BE TO SECTION. FIVE NINE FOUR EIGHT SEVEN FOUR POINT ONE AND IN PREVIOUS YEARS WHEN WE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO AMEND BILLS AND COMMITTEE AND IF THERE IS TIME I WOULD HOPE THAT WE COULD MIL AMEND THIS BILL IN COMMITTEE BEFORE IT GETS TO APPROPRIATIONS. I KNOW BUT I MEAN IF YOU HAVE A PRESS. GOT IT. CENTER GALGIANI A WONDERFUL SUGGESTION MAYBE AT A DIFFERENT TIME BUT THIS IS OUR ONLY SCHEDULED HEARING OF THIS COMMITTEE. SO TO ADVANCE YOUR MOTION WOULD BE TO DO SO TODAY AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER EVERY MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE WILL BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE DRAFTED. AMENDMENTS IN PROPER FORM BEFORE THE MET THE MEASURE IS PUT BEFORE THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE IF IT PASSES TODAY. OKAY ALL RIGHT NUMBERS IN ADVENTURES TO OUR MORNING. WE HAVE A MOTION WITH AN AMENDMENT- DO I NEED TO RE STATED AGAIN. OKAY SO- IT'S WITH NOW. FORMALLY BEFORE THE COMMITTEE AND THE DEATH THE SECRETARY TO PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

ALL RIGHT MEMBERS WE'RE GOING TO HEAR ONE MORE BILL BEFORE OUR TIME CERTAIN. SITES ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY TO SEVENTY THREE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM HE'S HERE IN THE CHAMBERS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM WE WELCOME YOU AND AS YOUR- PODIUM IS GETTING CLEANED- WE WELCOME YOU TO THE SENATE CENTER LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR TESTIMONY THIS MORNING I BELIEVE IN AND START I REALLY. COMBINATION I KNOW- MY FRIEND FROM THE NORTH COAST IS- WAITING ON IN A VERY IMPORTANT BILL- AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY THREE WOULD ALLOW AN ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER. LIKE CEDAR SINAI TO SUBMIT CANDIDATES FOR SPECIAL FACULTY PERMITS DIRECTLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD. UNDER CURRENT LAW CEDAR'S MOSCOW THREE UCLA TO COMPLETE THE APPLICATION PROCESS AND OBTAIN THE PERMIT. THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS TO EXPEDITE THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS. BUT UCLA IS CURRENTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALLOW CEDARS TO DO WHAT IT'S ALREADY DOING WITH UCLA. THE A SPECIALIZED FACULTY PHYSICIANS WHO HOLD THESE PERMITS TEACH PERFORM RESEARCH AND GREATLY AND POSITIVELY IMPACT MEDICAL CARE- A CEDARS IS CURRENTLY RECRUITING SPECIAL LICENSEES. WHO WILL BE INVOLVED IN CARING FOR COVERT PAGE. ACT SAID IN LONG KERR. LAW TRANSPLANT AND ANOTHER WHO CURRENTLY HAS A GROUP WHO TREATS EXTRACORPOREAL MEMBRANE OXYGENATION PATIENTS. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL WILL BE DR SHLOMO MELAMED. EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF ACADEMIC AFFAIRS AND DEAN OF MEDICAL FACULTY AND- PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AT CEDARS SINAI. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM SO WILL CALL UPON YOUR FIRST WITNESS DR SHLOMO OF MEHMED I'M INTERESTED HE'S ON THE PHONE LINE AND WE WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY ALLOCATE. COULD NOT GOOD GOOD MORNING SHOWING THAT EITHER AND BY CHANGING A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU FOR HIM FOR HEARING ME. FIND OUT THE MOMENT EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND- DEAN OF THE MEDICAL FACULTY AT CEDARS SINAI. WITH THE AB TWO TWO SEVEN THREE BECAUSE NOW MORE THAN EVER WE NEED TO RECRUIT THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST POSITIONS IN THE WORLD FOR CALIFORNIA. THE ABILITY TO SPECIALLY IMPORTANT DURING THE CURRENT PANDEMIC IT WOULD SPEED UP THE APPROVAL OF DR SULTAN SPECIALIZED IN COVERED NINETEEN PATIENT CARE. THE CURRENT GOAL ONLY ALLOWS APPROVED MEDICAL SCHOOLS TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE SECTIONS. TWENTY ONE SIXTY EIGHT TWENTY ONE THIRTEEN AND TWENTY ONE ELEVEN. THIS RESTRICTION LIMITS THE FLEXIBILITY OF INDEPENDENT ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTERS SUCH AS THE DESIGN. TO APPOINT FOREIGN TRAINED PHYSICIANS WITHOUT SECURING AGREEMENT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL SCHOOL. TO ACT AS THE INTERMEDIARY PROCESS COME THE ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER BEING IN THE MEDICAL SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR PROPHECIES. THIS DELAYS THE ABILITY OF THE POSITION TO BECOME AN ACTIVE POSITION BY UP TO TWELVE MONTHS. THIS PROPOSED BILL MAKES IT SIMPLE CHANGE FEDERAL LAWSUIT ASTANA COMMITTEE APPLICANT UNDER THE SPECIAL USE PERMITS LANGUAGE AND THE CURRENT ROLE CEDARS SINAI MASCO THROUGH UCLA TO COMPLETE THE APPLICATION PROCESS AND OBTAIN THE PROPER PERMISSION FOR RECRUITMENT. TRULY EXTRAORDINARY. WHO HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN OTHER COUNTRIES. AB TWO TWO SEVEN THREE DOES NOT CHANGED ANY LICENSING REQUIREMENTS OR FEES DOES NOT ESTABLISH ANY NEW ENTITIES MUST BE REGULATED HE DOES NOT ALLOW AND NON LICENSED CALIFORNIA POSITION TO PRACTICE OUTSIDE OF THE CURRENT SPECIAL PERMIT REQUIREMENTS. THROUGH ITS EXTENSIVE RESIDENCY AND FELLOWSHIP PROGRAMS CEDARS SINAI TRAIN PULLED IN FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY UNION POSITIONS TOGETHER WITH RESEARCHERS WHO LATER SERVED CALIFORNIA AND LEAD NATIONALLY RENOWNED CLINICAL AND RESEARCH PROGRAMS. CEDARS SINAI HAS NEVER PUT FORTH A CANDIDATE WHO WAS UNSUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING A SPECIALIZED. SO SHOULD THIS BILL PASS WE WOULD CONTINUE TO PUT FORTH THE SAME NUMBER OF EXCEPTIONAL QUALITY APPLICANTS BUT WITHOUT THE UNNECESSARY DELAY. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO PAY THE FEES HAS APPROPRIATE. THIS WOULD ALLOW SINAI AND A FEW OTHER PROMINENT CALIFORNIA INSTITUTIONS TO RECRUIT THOSE VERY FEW BUT IMPORTANT LUMINARY PHYSICIANS AND PHYSICIANS SCIENTISTS. AS WELL AS JUNIOR POSITIONS WITH VERY SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE WHO WERE TRAINED IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND TO SPECIAL EXPERTISE WILL SUPPORT OUR MISSION TO PROVIDE CUTTING EDGE TREATMENT BENEFITING THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA.

YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- BRING THIS FORWARD I APPRECIATE I APPRECIATE- WHAT TO YOU AND THE SPONSOR CEDAR SINAI'S TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH AND THAT IS A FORMER FACULTY MEMBER. AT AT THE UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA DAVIS CERTAINLY HAVE FAMILIARITY WITH- THIS- THIS EXEMPTION. I GUESS MY- SO I DO HAVE A COUPLE CONCERNS OF THE BILL PERHAPS YOU CAN TY TO ADDRESS THIS FIRST OF ALL- I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT- IT DOES ESTABLISH A LEGAL DEFINITION OF ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER- WHICH ACTUALLY IS NOT SORT OF CONSISTENT WITH COMMON USAGE- SO IN. IN AT LEAST IN THE MEDICAL FIELD- AND IN THE ACADEMIC FIELD ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER IS. USUALLY A HOSPITAL THAT OF COURSE PERFORMS TEACHING FUNCTION WHICH EITHER SIDE DOES WAS AFFILIATED WITH A MEDICAL SCHOOL WHICH I BELIEVE CEDARS SINAI IS AS WELL BUT YET THAT'S NOT PART OF THE DEFINITION. AND I NOTE I DO REALIZE THAT PART OF THE REASON FOR THE BILL WAS IS BECAUSE THE CURRENT PROCESS FOR THE- EXEMPTION. WAS THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE A MEDICAL SCHOOL FACULTY APPOINTMENT WHICH TOOK TIME RIGHT TO DO THAT AND THAT'S WHAT THEY DO THROUGH UCLA- BUT I DO FEEL THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO CREATE A LEGAL DEFINITION OF ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER IT SHOULD ACTUALLY INCLUDE A FORMAL AFFILIATION AGREEMENT WITH A MEDICAL SCHOOL- BECAUSE I THINK THAT. THAT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S A SERVICE THAT THE PEOPLE YOU BRING OVER WHICH- UNDER DOES EXEMPTION SHOULD BE PERFORMING A YEAH RESEARCH AND TEACHING FUNCTION- THAT YOU'RE THIS ISN'T BECOMING A LOOPHOLE TO BRING IN PEOPLE. TO A PRACTICE OUT OF WHO DON'T NEED A LICENSE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AT ANY AYE UNDERSTAND THAT THE PEOPLE WHO DO COME IN THROUGH THIS PARTICULAR- FUNCTION. ARE IN PEOPLE WHO ARE PRE EMINENT IN THEIR FIELD AROUND THE WORLD AND- USUALLY OR OFTEN TIMES HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OR THE INSTITUTION TEMPORARILY. AND SO INSTEAD OF MAKING THEM GO THROUGH THE WHOLE LICENSURE PROCESS- DAY IF DEAL WITH CREATED THIS SO THAT- THESE WEEK WE COULD HAVE. THESE EMINENT PEOPLE HERE IN THE U. S. AND BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW HAVE HAVE THEM- DO THEIR RESEARCH TUTOR TEACHING AND OFTENTIMES IN ORDER MEETING POLITICAL SCHOOLS WANT TO DO SOME VERY LIMITED CLINICAL TIME WITHIN. THE CONTEXT THAT INSTITUTIONS. THE SO THE OTHER THING SAID MIKE. IS THE WAY THE BILL IS FRAMED- WELL CERTAINLY CEDARS SINAI THINKS FITS THE BILL AND- AND I KNOW THAT YOU. THERE'S EFFORTS IN THE DEFINITION BY DECLARING THE SIZE AND SO FORTH. I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT. YOU COULD HAVE A HOSPITAL THAT CREATES A FACULTY PROGRAM BUT IF IT'S NOT ACCREDITED AND THAT'S THE AGAIN BY SELENA MEDICAL SCHOOL MEDICAL SCHOOL ITSELF HAS TO BE CREDITED BY EITHER D. L. C. M. E. OR THE OSTEOPATHIC. MEDICAL SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION THAT ALSO IS A LAYER OF PROTECTION TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE BRINGING IN PEOPLE WHO. THROUGH THAT ARE RECOGNIZED BY INSTITUTIONS THAT ACTUALLY HAVE TO MEET CERTAIN STANDARDS. SO I GUESS I'LL POSE A QUESTION ABOUT. IT IN THE DEFINITION WHICH WOULD BE CONSISTENT COMMON USAGE THAT THE INSTITUTION ALSO HAVE TO HAVE A FORMAL FILIATION AGREEMENT WITH A MEDICAL SCHOOL WILL- SO HOPEFULLY THAT CONSIDERATION. AND THEN THE OTHER POINT I GUESS I WOULD ALSO JUST MAKE IS THAT- YOU KNOW I DO THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT. HAVING PEOPLE ARE PERFORMING CLINICAL DUTIES. THEY DON'T HAVE A LICENSE BECAUSE IN SOME SENSES- IF FOR SOME REASON THAT PERSON YOU KNOW- AND AGAIN THESE ARE PEOPLE. THAT THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE OF THIS OF PEOPLE OR EMINENT ALTHOUGH THE YOU TALK ABOUT ALSO BEING IN JUNIOR PROMISING JUNIOR PEOPLE. THAT IF THEY DO. HAVE A PROBLEM. YOU CAN'T TAKE THE LICENSE AWAY EXAMPLE LICENSE SO- SO THAT'S SO THE DECISION DISCIPLINARY MECHANISMS ARE NOT ENFORCING IN PLACE AND- I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA AS OPPOSED. TO THIS PARTICULAR BILL SO- I EIGHT ONE BE SURE THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS PRETTY NARROWLY FOCUSED AND CONSISTENT WITH THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THESE. EXEMPTIONS THAT. THAT HAPPENED OF COURSE LONG STANDING TO ALLOW- AGAIN AND THE PEOPLE TO COME TO OUR COUNTRY AND TO OUR STATE. TO ADD. TO BASICALLY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE AND SO FORTH SO- APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE THANK YOU. I THINK THEY'RE BETTER PAN. THIS IS ANY OTHER COM AND I'M GONNA GO TO THE ALL TO RESPOND TO YOUR CON AS WELL. ANY COMMENTS SINCE. ALL RIGHT C. NINE SOMETHING BLOOM WOULD YOU LIKE TO. RESPOND TO THAT OUR PARENTS CONCERNED YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AFTER THE QUESTION COMMENT SENT TO SENATOR I THINK- I'LL ANSWER VERY QUICKLY AND THEN TURN IT OVER TO DR MELAMED IF THAT'S OKAY- SINCE ARE SOME TECHNICALITIES HERE BUT- THERE IS NO LOOPHOLE CREATED HERE BECAUSE- THIS REALLY IS THE SAME PROCESS THAT SEARS WOULD BE FOLLOWING- THAT- UCLA'S FOLLOWING. CURRENTLY TILT- A PROVIDE THESE PERMITS- THERE IS- THERE ARE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS- THAT TO SEEK TO ADDRESS THE ACADEMIC. THAT THE DEFINITION OF ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER- THE MEDICAL BOARD HAS NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE ON THOSE YET BUT WE HAVE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS. WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD- AND WE'RE HOPING THAT THAT ALL GETS WORKED OUT. AND IF I COULD TURN IT OVER TO DOCTOR APPOINTMENTS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU'RE YOU'RE ACCEPTING THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS THAT'S RIGHT YES MEDIAN THE- IN THE ANALYSIS ABSOLUTELY. DR NEVADA ARE YOU STILL ON THE LINE AND SO WE WELCOME YOUR RESPONSE CENTER PAT. THANK YOU THANK THANK YOU DR PENN FOOTBALL FOR THE QUESTION WELL ACTUALLY SET ASIDE AS A MEMBER OF THE INDEPENDENT ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER ASSOCIATION. SO WE DO HAVE A- THE ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE PART OF THE MEDICAL SCHOOL. THE DEFINED AS SUCH- WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST- AND I H. FUNDED RESEARCH PROGRAM. OF OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. WE HAVE A GREAT SCHOOL LONG TERM. GROUP PHD PRO WE WE'VE WE'VE WE A LOT FIVE HUNDRED TRAINEE. SOWE ARE A- ACTIVITY MEDICAL. AND I'M- OF THE- MEDICAL CENTERS. NATIONALLY NOT AFFILIATED WITH WITH WITH MEDICAL SCHOOL. SO THAT THAT THAT THAT TECHNICAL DEFINITION REALLY DIDN'T COME INTO OUR LANGUAGE AND I WANT TO RE EMPHASIZE. WE'RE NOT PROPOSING ANY DIFFERENCE IN PROCESS OR PROCEDURE. WE WOULD HEAR FULLY TO ALL THE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE. THAT ARE CURRENTLY AND AT LAKE AND THERE'S KNOWING THAT THERE IS NOT AND THERE IS NOT ANOTHER LANGUAGE HERE WHICH WOULD CHANGE ANY OF THE CURRENT PROCESS EASIER- WE DO HAVE. WHAT WELL OILED UP PROCESS IS IN PLACE FOR BOTH OF THE SITE. THE TWENTY ONE ELEVEN TWENTY ONE THIRTEENTH CANNOT PRACTICE MEDICINE. WITHOUT A SUPERVISOR- AND SO. AS PROXIES FOR OVERSIGHT AND DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS ARE IN PLACE. AGAIN TO REEMPHASIZE WE ARE NOT. ASKING TO CHANGE ANYTHING IN THE CURRENT PROCESS EXCEPT. THE APPLICATION PROCESS. ALL RIGHT CENTER PENNY FOR THE FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS FROM YOU CENTER PAN. I GUESS- APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER- I GUESS I WOULD SAY IS THAT I'M NOT SAYING AND I SAY FILIATION- IT DOESN'T MEAN CERTAINLY CONTROL OR OWNERSHIP BY MEDICAL SCHOOL- OR THAT THEIR ONE INSTITUTION SO. ACTUALLY I TRAINED IN A HOSPITAL THAT WAS INDEPENDENT BUT IT STILL HAD AFFILIATION WITH THE MEDICAL SCHOOL AND SO- SO I GUESS- THAT. IS ON JUST- I THINK THAT THERE IS. THAT RELATIONSHIP EXACTLY HOW WE DEFINE THAT LADY CAN BE CLARIFIED- BUT- I GUESS I WOULD SAY IS THAT- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THAT CEDARS MANY ACTUALLY- HOSPITALS OR SILLY OF MEDICAL SCHOOLS ARE INDEPENDENT INSTITUTIONS- AND SO. I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE SORT OF DEFINITIONAL PIECE WITH ALSO THE MEDICAL BOARD HAVING THOSE CONCERNS I APPRECIATE THAT HE SAID THE MEDICAL BOARD STILL WORKING THROUGH SOME OF THAT- BUT I THINK AT THIS TIME IDEA I'D LIKE TO SEE A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT AND IT'S NOT CEDARS I'M WORRIED ABOUT ACTUALLY. OKAY DOES NOT WORRY ABOUT CEDARS SINAI I DON'T WANT TO CREATE SOME KIND OF A LONG DAY- SITUATION WHERE NOW WE HAVE OTHER INSTITUTIONS TRYING TO GET IN AND USING THIS A WAY TO- BASICALLY- BRING IN- CLINICIANS WITHOUT HAVING THEM REQUIRED TO GO THROUGH THE- MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. SENATOR PAN. UNDER A MEMBER BLUE LET YOU CLOSE UP IT YOU ADDRESS ISSUE OF THE- OF HAVING AT REQUIRING A FORMAL AGREEMENT WITH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL SCHOOL. AS A PART OF YOUR BILL IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT YOUR CLOTHES AS WELL SO. WALKING A CAR WITH A PREFERRED DOCTOR MOMENT COULD TO ADDRESS THAT SPECIFIC QUESTION THAT IS A- RATHER WHAT WHAT. AND IT. ALL RIGHT WE GOT TO THE OROVILLE. HELLO WE ARE WE ARE IN BEAUTIFULLY. WITH UCLA'S. SO THAT THAT THAT QUESTION THAT QUESTION IS MOOT. HOWEVER THE LANGUAGE AS PROPOSED IS VERY RESTRICTIVE- IN TERMS OF ALLOWING EITHER. ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA TO QUALIFY FOR THIS. AND THAT WAS THAT WAS PURPOSELY SLOW SO THAT WE WOULD ENSURE. THAT THEY WOULD BE- I AM- ADDITION MISSION WITHIN THE PROPOSAL. THAT WOULD RESTRICT ITS ACADEMIC. MEDICAL CENTERS. WHO UP HOLD THE PRINCIPLE AND THE QUALITY- WHICH WHICH SET THE SET THE BAND OF THE PROGRAM YES PEOPLE. IN ATLANTA I COULD NOT A BLANKET- MISTER CHAIR- THE ONLY- TO- FACILITIES THAT WE THINK. WOULD POSSIBLY ALSO QUALIFIERS OCCUR BURKE OF SAN FRANCISCO AND LOMA LINDA- AGAIN TWO HIGHLY RESPECTED INSTITUTIONS. SUCH AS OF A MORALITY CLAUSE BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WOULD NOT ACCEPT THAT TYPE OF AN AMENDMENT TO THE BILL. IT'S. A IT'S A RESTRICTIVE. I TRIED TO. THE THINGS A COP DOES DIE IN WITH YOUR DESIRE TO PROVIDE THIS BILL TO SEE SINAI. WHEN WE HAVE WILL BE HAPPY TO COULD CONVERSE WITH DR PAN GOING. AS AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD OBVIOUSLY THERE'S ONLY A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME FOR THAT BUT WE'LL CERTAINLY BE WILLING TO DO THAT. ARE YOU. OKAY HI YOU'RE WELCOME TO CLOSE ASSEMBLY MEMBER I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND- UNDERSTAND THAT- TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I RECOGNIZE THAT ABOUT HIS OUR MOTION ON THE FLOOR.

SHANGHAI ARCHULETA BURCHILL OUT AYE DODD DODD AYE GALGIANI AYE GALGIANI AYE HILL AYE HILL AYE LEYVA I BELIEVE THAT I CAN. PAN AYE WILK HI WILK HI. THAT THE BILLS OUT NINETY ZERO THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER. OKAY WE'RE GOING TO GO TO OUR NEXT ITEM TYPE WAS TIME SERVED ON OUR AGENDA ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN ACTUALLY WE'RE GOOD AT NOT TWENTY SEVENTEEN TEN FIRST REVIEW EIGHT NINETY RIGHT. YEAH EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY DOLLARS AND SEVENTEEN CENTS. OKAY ASSEMBLY WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD WE WELCOME YOU TO THE SENATE CHAMBERS. WE UNDERSTAND YOU'RE GOING TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT NINETY TWO US. AND WITH THAT- WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU THE FOR AND WILL FOLLOW THE PROCEDURES WE'VE DONE ON PREVIOUS BILLS YOUR WITNESSES. THREE MINUTES COMBINED EACH. LISTEN TO THOSE WHO HAVE COME TO TESTIFY ELSEWHERE IN THE BUILDING ON THE PHONE LINES AND THEN PROVIDE SAME OPPORTUNITY TO THE OPPOSITION. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD WELCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOOD MORNING TODAY AND PRESENTING AB EIGHT NINETY WHICH WILL ALLOW NURSE PRACTITIONERS WHO HAVE MET. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS TO PRACTICE WITHOUT A PHYSICIAN'S SUPERVISION. FROM LATE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO EIGHTEEN I WAS A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION'S FUTURE HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE COMMISSION. DURING THAT TIME I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THE CHALLENGES WE FACE- WITH OUR HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AS WE STRIVE TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS IN MANY RURAL AND URBAN AREAS. THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN UCSF REPORT ESTIMATES THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE WILL HAVE A SHORTFALL OF FORTY SEVEN HUNDRED PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. AND BY TWENTY THIRTY WE WILL NEED ANOTHER ADDITIONAL FORTY ONE HUNDRED PROVIDERS TO MEET EXPECT POPULATION DEMAND. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN THE NUMBER OF PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS IN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY DROPPED BY TEN PERCENT. AT A TIME THAT THE POPULATION GREW BY TWO POINT FOUR MILLION. CLEARLY MOVING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. LIKE MANY OF YOU HAVE ALWAYS SUPPORTED ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR RESIDENCY PROGRAMS AND LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAMS. THESE ARE GREAT TOOLS THEY'RE COSTING AS TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY. AND HAVE NOT AND WILL NOT MEET. OUR WORKFORCE NEEDS WE CANNOT BUY OURSELVES OUT OF THE SHORTAGE OF PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. THERE IS A TOOL THAT I'VE COME TO BELIEVE IS NEEDED IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT IS REFLECTED IN AB EIGHT NINETY. WHICH WOULD ALLOW NATIONALLY ACCREDITED NURSE PRACTITIONERS WITH A MINIMUM OF THREE YEARS CLINICAL EXPERIENCE AND A THREE YEAR TRANSITION TO PRACTICE PERIOD A TOTAL OF SIX YEARS. ALL OF WHICH UNDER THE WOULD BE UNDER THE PRESSURE OF SUPERVISION OF A PHYSICIAN. TO THEN BE ALLOWED TO PROVIDE SERVICES WITHOUT THE NEED FOR STANDARDIZED PROCEDURES. UNDER APPROVED BY POSITION. THESE THERE'S PRACTITIONERS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PASS A NATIONAL LICENSURE EXAM MINISTERS COMPETENCY. EXAM WOULD NEED TO BE VALIDATED BY AN ENTITY WITHIN DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND IF DEEMED NOT SUFFICIENT. SUPPLEMENTAL COMPONENTS FOR A CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC EXAM WOULD BE DEVELOPED THE REQUIRED. THE MINUTES FROM THIS COMMITTEE WHICH I WILL BE ACCEPTING FURTHER STRENGTHEN AND CLARIFY VIRTUALLY ALL ASPECTS OF THIS BILL. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR AND HIS STAFF PARTICULARLY SERRA- FOR THEIR MANY HOURS OF HARD WORK SPENT ON IMPROVING THIS BILL. WILL CALIFORNIA BE BREAKING NEW GROUND WITH THIS BILL ACTUALLY NOT. THERE ARE CURRENTLY TWENTY THREE OTHER STATES THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION AND WASHINGTON DC. WHICH ALLOW NURSE PRACTITIONERS TO PRACTICE IN SUCH A MANNER I WOULD NOTE THAT THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION AS THE LARGEST EMPLOYER OF NURSES IN THE COUNTRY. THE MOST RECENT STATES TO ADOPT THIS POLICY IN VIRGINIA IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. SIGNED INTO LAW BY GOVERNOR WAS ALSO A PHYSICIAN. IN MARCH FLORIDA BECAME THE TWENTY THIRD STATE AND THEY'RE LAW WENT INTO EFFECT IN JULY. IN TWENTY NINE STATES THERE ARE LESS RESTRICTIONS ON NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND THERE ARE CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA. AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN THIS BILL WOULD BE THE MOST STRINGENT OF ANY CURRENT LAW IN THE COUNTRY. THERE ARE COUNTLESS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN NURSE PRACTITIONERS PRACTICE SAFELY AND COMPETENTLY WITHOUT THE- OVERSIGHT OF A POSITION. BUT NONETHELESS WE HAVE INCLUDED ADDITIONAL TIME REQUIREMENTS IN THIS BILL TO ASSURE ONLY MOST EXPERIENCED NURSE PRACTITIONERS WILL BE ABLE TO PRACTICE THIS WAY. NO NURSE PRACTITIONER RIGHT OUT OF SCHOOL WOULD QUALIFY UNDER THIS BILL AND I AGREE WITH THAT APPROACH. I BELIEVE THE BILL STRIKES A REASONABLE BALANCE BETWEEN THE NEED TO PROVIDE MORE ACCESS TO CARE THEY NEED TO PROVIDE QUALITY TO MADE TO MAINTAIN QUALITY HEALTHCARE SERVICES. WILL NOT JUST BENEFIT RURAL AREAS WHICH OF COURSE IS OF GREAT INTEREST TO ME BUT WILL ALSO ASSIST IN UNDERSERVED URBAN AREAS. CURRENTLY 59% OF NURSE PRACTITIONERS ARE PROVIDING PRIMARY CARE WHILE ONLY 17% OF POSITIONS DO SO. THERE'S PETITIONERS ARE OFTEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO ACCEPT MEDICARE ON MEDICARE THAN THEIR PHYSICIAN COUNTERPARTS 90% OF NURSE PRACTITIONERS WILL WILL LIKELY SEE NOBODY CAL AND MEDICARE PATIENTS COMPARED ABOUT 64% OF THEIR COUNTERPARTS POSITIONS. THESE NUMBERS AND COUNTLESS OTHERS FROM STUDIES I HAVE READ AND HAVE SHOWN THAT NEEDED ACCESS. IS INCREASED WHEN SUPERVISION REQUIREMENTS ARE REMOVED. BUT TWENTY MEDICAL AND RESEARCH REVIEW ENTITLED STATE NURSE PRACTITIONER PRACTICE REGULATIONS IN U. S. HEALTHCARE DELIVERY OUTCOMES THE SYSTEMIC REVIEW FOUND AND I QUOTE. RESULTS INDICATE THAT EXPANDED NURSE PRACTITIONER PRACTICE REGULATIONS WERE ASSOCIATE WITH GREATER. NURSE PRACTITIONER SUPPLY. AND IMPROVED ACCESS TO CARE AMONG RURAL AND UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS WITHOUT DECREASING QUALITY. AND A FURTHER QUOTE FINDING SUPPORT THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE ON THE FUTURE OF NURSING. THAT QUOTE LAW RICK LAW REGULATIONS AND POLICIES THAT PREVENT ADVANCED PRACTICE REGISTERED NURSES WHICH ARE NERVE NURSE PRACTITIONERS FROM PROVIDING THE FULL SCOPE OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THEY'RE EDUCATED AND TRAINED TO PROVIDE SHOULD BE REMOVED THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE IS AN INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS OUTSIDE OF GOVERNMENT PROVIDE UNBIASED AND AUTHORITY AUTHORITATIVE ADVICE. DECISION MAKERS AND THE PUBLIC. AND NOW SEES A PEER REVIEWED RESEARCH AND THERE IS A LOT OF IT HAVE CONCLUDED THAT NURSE PRACTITIONERS PROVIDE CARE OF COMPARABLE QUALITY AS PHYSICIANS. EVEN WITH THERE'S PRACTITIONERS PRACTICING WITHOUT PHYSICIAN SUPERVISION. PATIENT SATISFACTION IS HIGH WITH THERE'S PRACTITIONERS. AIRED INTRODUCING THIS BILL I MET WITH OPPONENTS I ASKED THEM FOR EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY AND I RECEIVED NINE. WHAT I HAVE HEARD IS ANECDOTAL STORIES ABOUT PROBLEMS. THERE ARE THERE BUT THERE ARE NO PEER REVIEWED SCIENCE BASED STUDIES AND I WOULD EXPECT MORE FROM THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY. THE TIME IS NOW TO JOIN TWENTY THREE OTHER STATES HAVE MOVED THIS APPROACH. AND ARE PROVIDING GREATER ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE pNEED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THE BILL IS SUPPORTED BY A BROAD COALITION INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BASED HEALTH ALLIANCE ESSENTIAL HEALTH CARE THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE S. CI YOU A. R. P. R. C. R. C. AT LEAST EIGHTY ORGANIZATIONS ORGANIZATIONS ALTOGETHER TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT.

AB EIGHT NINETY WILL ALLOW NURSE PRACTITIONERS IN CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT. EXPANDED ACCESS TO CARE. MORE THAN ELEVEN MILLION PEOPLE. IN CALIFORNIA LIVE IN AN AREA THAT HAS A SHORTAGE. OF PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS AND AS A FAMILY MEMBER WOULD POINT OUT. ALMOST SIXTY PERCENT. OF NURSE PRACTITIONERS IN CALIFORNIA. PRACTICE PRIMARY CARE. VERSUS ONLY 17% OF POSITIONS. NURSE PRACTITIONERS ARE MORE LIKELY THAN PHYSICIANS TO TAKE MEDIC HOW THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO WORK IN RURAL AND URBAN UNDERSERVED AREA. AND BY PASSING AB EIGHT NINETY AND DE LINKING THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO OF BUREAUCRATIC ANTIQUATED MODEL OF SUPERVISION THIS WILL ALLOW NURSE PRACTITIONERS TO PRACTICE TO THE FULL EXTENT. OF THEIR EDUCATION AND TRAINING. 80% OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE THAT THEY WOULD LIKE THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE BELIEVE EATING THE SHORTAGE OF. PHYSICIANS NURSES AND OTHER HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS ARE PRIORITY AND WE BELIEVE. EIGHTY EIGHT NINETY TAKES AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THIS DIRECTION.

INVITE MEMBERS TO A SHARE THEIR THOUGHTS AND THEN WILL OF COURSE INVITE THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL THAT THE DISSIPATE WITH US. C. SENATOR PAT SENATOR PAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CHAIR AND- WELL I THINK- THE SUMMER- DOCTOR WOULD FOR IS. ACTION FOR THIS ISSUE- I'D FIRST OF ALL I JUST WANT TO START OFF BY SAYING THAT YOU KNOW MANY OF US- WELL WE CERTAINLY KNOW EACH OTHER AS FELLOW LEGISLATORS- WE- DON'T CERTAINLY HAS HAD. NOT PREVIOUSLY BEFORE IT CAME TO ALLEGE AND BRING VARIOUS EXPERIENCES I KNOW THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL IS A- IMMINENT DENNIS THEN THE LEADERS LOCAL COMMUNITY BEFORE CMING TO. THE STATE ASSEMBLY I KNOW MANY OF YOU AS WELL- HAVE ALSO. PURSUED MANY- AND BRING MANY EXPERIENCES- MYSELF SIDE BECAUSE MOST OF YOU KNOW BY SAID IN ME AS A PHYSICIAN BUT ACTUALLY- AS AN ACADEMIC POSITION I PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON WORKFORCE. RESEARCH SO I WAS ACTUALLY- SO IS CONSIDERED AN INTERNATIONAL EXPERT ON WORKFORCE. INVITED INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES AS WELL AS NATIONAL ONES- ACTUALLY AUTHORED WORKFORCE PAPERS AND POLICY PAPER AND RESEARCH ORIGINAL RESEARCH ON WORK FORCE AS WELL AND SO- NOW SOME MY- CONCERNS AND QUESTIONS WILL COME FROM THAT BACKGROUND NOT JUST A FROM- THINGS I HEARD BOB AND LEGISLATURE BY DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS I'D- LIKE TO ASK AUTHORS THAT'S POSSIBLE ACTUALLY AMOUNTS. GO AHEAD ASK ALL THREE AND ASK A DOCTOR WOULD TO ANSWER ADAM SO FIRST. QUESTION ONE IS- ACTUALLY ABOUT THE CURRENT SUPPLY OF NURSE PRACTITIONERS BOTH IN CITY CALIFORNIA NATIONALLY DO WE HAVE AN OVERSUPPLY OR DO WE HAVE NURSE PRACTITIONERS WHO BASICALLY SEEKING. WHO DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO DO OR- OR- ARE THEY PRETTY MUCH. YOU KNOW THEY THEY'VE ALL FOUND OCCUPATIONS SECOND OF ALL- V. I'D TRANSITION TIME THAT'S IN THE BILL- SO THEY SAY FOR THREE YEARS IS THERE SOME STANDARDS ARE STRUCTURED TO THAT TIME THAT- THAT THAT'S THAT THIS BILL IS GOING TO REQUIRE OR IS IT SIMPLY NEEDS THREE YEARS OF CLINICAL WORK AND- THERE'S NO STANDARDS ARE- IN TERMS OF FLIGHT TODAY NEED TO BE DOING. AND I. THE KIND OF BREATH OF EXPERIENCE PREPARED FOR THEM FOR. PRACTICE WHETHER THAT WOULD ALL. GIVEN THIS EXPERIENCES IS WHAT THE PRESS OF THE AND TRACK TO BE GAY AND THEN FINALLY. AFTER THEY COMPLETE THAT IS THERE ANY FORM OF- I MEAN THEY HAVE TO BE LICENSED CERTAINLY BUT IS THERE ANY SORT OF RECERTIFICATION- THERE'S ANY SORT OF VALUATION SO THAT OVER TIME. TO ENSURE THAT THE PRACTITIONER IS CONTINUING TO. BE UP TO DATE. IN TERMS OF- THEIR THEIR SKILLS- BECAUSE AFTER ALL THE PRACTICE PRACTICE THOSE OF ALSO I WOULD MAKE NOTES THAT DAY HERE. IN THIS COMMITTEE- WHEN WE'VE DONE OUR REVIEWS OF THE B. R. AND- I'VE ACTUALLY ASKED AS A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT THEIR STANDARDS FOR ASSURING PEOPLE. ACTUALLY COMPLETED THEIR CONTINUING EDUCATION AND SO FORTH AND WE FOUND SOME DEFICIENCIES IN THAT REGARD TERMS OF. AND TERMS OF THE IT IN TERMS OF LICENSING SO- SO BEYOND WHAT THE BOARD WOULD REQUIRE- IT ARE THERE OTHER STANDARDS THAT WE'RE ALSO LOOKING FOR IN TERMS OF- RESEARCH OCCASIONS SELVES. AGAIN HOPEFULLY IT'S NOT TOO MANY QUESTIONS BUT- THERE WHETHER IT'S IN THE APPRECIATE- YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS ON ON THIS QUESTION ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS OR OF COURSE IF YOU WISH TO THEM TO THE PROPONENTS AS WELL. THANK YOU. I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS AND MORE THAN HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTION QUITE FRANKLY SO. GUARDS TO SUPPLY THAT PIECE I AM NOT AWARE OF A STUDY THAT'S ABOUT THE- SUPPLY OF MPS. BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS. THAT IN STATES THAT HAVE A MORE LENIENT SCOPE OF PRACTICE THERE ARE A HIGHER NUMBER OF NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND WHAT'S HAPPENING HIS IN STATES WHERE IT IS MORE RESTRICTIVE. THOSE ARE THE PRACTITIONERS WHO WISH TO RESPOND WISH TO PURSUE. AN INDEPENDENT PRACTICE OR WITH SUPERVISION TEND TO GO TO STATES SO THE NO PER CAPITA CALIFORNIA. IS PROBABLY LOWER THAN IT IS IN MANY OTHER STATES. WITH REGARDS TO DO A TRADE ISSUE. IN THE PRESS THIS REMEMBER. THAT AT. AND I DO THIS ISSUE. I MEAN YOU HAVE TO HAVE THREE YEAR AS AN FOR. TO ABLE TO. GO TO THE NEXT THREE YEAR TREND PERIOD AND IS DOES. TO FOCUS ON ONE OF FIVE A AND THAT. IT IS A FOR. THESE PRETTY AREAS WHERE THE- AND ONCE YOU COMPLETE THAT AND THAT THAT TRAINING IN THOSE FIVE AREAS. THAN THE THAN THE BILL SPECIFICALLY SAYS THAT YOU ARE NOT. ALLOWED TO PRACTICE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF WHERE YOUR TRAINING AS- AS FAR AS SKILLS OVER TIME YOU KNOW I'M A PRACTICING DENTIST I STILL MAINTAIN MY LICENSE. REQUIRED TO DO CONTINUING EDUCATION- TO GO ACTUALLY ASK SOMEBODY TO GO BACK AND DO A RE CERTIFICATION- UNLESS YOU'RE A SPECIALIST THAT I'M AWARE OF MAYBE ADVANCED. ADVANCED LIFE SUPPORT THAT KIND OF THING- I'M NOT AWARE OF THAT SO I THINK THAT ADDING. A REQUIREMENT THAT SOMEBODY GO BACK IN RECERTIFY WOULD BE ONEROUS AND NOT NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF OTHER PROFESSIONS- YOU KNOW FAR IS DESCRIPTIVE. SEES AND- TO. I'M SURE YOU CAN GO THROUGH EVERY PROFESSION FIND THAT THERE AE PEOPLE WHO DON'T DO THEIR CONTINUING EDUCATION SO. SO YOU KNOW- BUT AS MEDICAL DENTAL YOU NAME IT IT'S PROBABLY OUT THERE AND IT'S ON IT'S ON THE BOARDS TO ACTUALLY. PLEASE STOP. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. SUMMER WOULD FOR THAT AND I AND I APPRECIATE THAT. THE THOSE ANSWERS- I WOULD MAKE NOTED THAT- CERTAINLY CALIFORNIA WITH THE BIGGEST STATE IN THE COUNTRY WE HAD TO HAVE THE MOST NUMBER OF A NURSE PRACTITIONERS- THE- I THINK WHEN YOU- WHEN I WAS IN THE OPENING- SOME NUMBER OF RACY FAIL POINTED OUT THAT HE AND ALSO I ACTUALLY SERVED. ON THE WORKFORCE COMMISSION I ESTIMATE THAT- I ENDED UP RESIGNING FROM THE COMMISSION BECAUSE I FELT THAT THE WORK OF THE COMMISSION WAS WAS WAS NOT. IN CONCERT WITH MY BACKGROUND IS A WORKFORCE RESEARCHER AND- SO I HAD DID HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE FINAL REPORT AND NOT FEEL LIKE I COULD TOUCH MY NAME TO IT- BUT I'LL JUST MAKE NOTE FIRST OF ALL- IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW THE ONE THE MAIN REASONS BUT FOR THIS BILL IS REGARDING- YOU KNOW WORKFORCE UNCERTAIN WE HAVE CHALLENGES WITH. WORKFORCE IN. RURAL COMMUNITIES AND DOES INCLUDING THE ONES REPRESENTED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND- MANY OF US YOU MAY REPRESENT. A REAL COMMUNITIES AS WELL SO ENDS COMMUNITY. I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT- YELLED THAT STATES THAT HAVE. OPENED UP THEIR THEIR LAWS THE STILL HAVE WORKFORCE ISSUES ALL RIGHT I MEAN IT'S A ROOF FOR COURSE RESEARCHER I DON'T SEE THOSE DIDN'T SEE THOSE GO AWAY AFTER THEY CHANGED OUR NURSE PRACTITIONERS ALSO. MAIL BECAUSE THE NURSE PRACTITIONERS A RARE DOING WORK THERE THEY'RE DOING THE WORK- HE MATCH THE VA THE VA STILL HAS SHORTAGES AND USE YOU SEE THE AGE THAT IS MINISTRATION STILL WORKING TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SEE. ALL THE PATIENTS. THAT WE NEED TO SEE SO- I THINK AS AN ANSWER TO WORK FORCE- I THINK THEY COULD ACTUALLY THE EVIDENCE IS KIND OF QUESTIONABLE ON THAT IS SOMEONE WHO'S HAS. A BACKGROUND IN LOOKING AT THAT. IT THAT THERE IS. THE TRAIN. YOU KNOW I. BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO BE CLEAR THAT THERE'S THIS IS NO COMPARISON TO WHAT PHYSICIANS. BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND IN PRACTICE GO THROUGH SO WHEN YOU GRADUATE MEDICAL SCHOOL HERE. IN CALIFORNIA OR DRESS THE COUNTRY BUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. YOU CAN'T JUST GO OUT AND HANG A SHINGLE. THE BOARD OF MEDICINE WILL NOT GIVE YOU A LICENSE. TO DO THAT. AND YOU CAN'T EVEN JUST SAY WELL I'LL GO PRACTICE UNDER SUPERVISION FOR THREE YEARS AND THEN I CAN GET A LICENSE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO GO TO AN ACCREDITED RESIDENCY PROGRAM AND IS SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY PREVIOUSLY SERVED. ON THE BOARD OF THE CREDITING BODY. THIS STANDARDS A VERY RIGOROUS. SO WE DO NOT LET PEOPLE INTO THE PLAN PRACTICE EVEN WITHIN AND D. WITHOUT A VERY STRUCTURED RIGOROUS- PROGRAM. THAT HAS TO BE. REVIEWED AND EVALUATED AND- ACTUALLY THE SUPERVISOR HAS TO SIGN OFF. THAT THE PERSON IS PREPARED FOR THE PARA PRACTICE. AND EVEN DESPITE THAT. YOU THEN ALSO HAVE TO TAKE ADDITIONAL EXAMINATIONS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT TO YOU ARE COMPETENT IN YOUR PARTICULAR SPECIALTY CERTIFICATION. ENOUGH PRACTICE. THAT ALSO MADE NOTE THAT. THE WAY IN ORDER FOR YOU THAT SERVE. AND SO NOW I'M GOING THROUGH THAT RIGHT NOW ACTUALLY EVEN THOUGH ON THE LEGISLATURE AND THAT AND FULL TIME PRACTICE. I ACTUALLY HAVE TO RECERTIFY. EVERY TEN YEARS TO PROVE THAT I AM KEEPING UP RIGHT AND- SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT PHYSICIANS ALL HAVE TO DO. THAT IS NOTED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT WE ARE YOU KNOW ABLE TO CONTINUE TO AND IF YOU DON'T- ESSENTIALLY IT'S VERY HARD TO GET ANY CREDENTIALS TO CONTINUE TO PRACTICE ANYWHERE SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS THAT WHAT PHYSICIANS GO THROUGH- SO AND IF YOU DON'T YOU KNOW YOU'RE G. IT'S VERY CHALLENGING FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO PRACTICE. NOW THAT I IN MY CAREER OF ALSO WORKED THE NURSE PRACTITIONERS I THINK AS MANY OF THE WITNESSES WHO FIVE TESTIFIED IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AND CERTAINLY THEY HAVE THEIR VERY IMPORTANT ROLE WE NEED NURSE PRACTITIONERS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEY DO VERY IMPORTANT WORK. AND FACT IN MANY WAYS. THERE AREN'T VERY MANY THINGS THAT I THINK THIS BILL WILL ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT THEY CAN'T ALREADY DO ALREADY. JUST HAPPENS THAT THEY HAVE TO BE WORKING IN TEAMS. WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK. MOST OF US WHO ARE LOOKING AT HEALTH POLICY SAY WE NEED MORE TEAM BASED CARE. WE DON'T NEED MORE FRAGMENTATION OF CARE WE NEED MORE TEAM BASED CARE. AND SO CREATING MORE INDEPENDENT PRACTITIONERS DOESN'T NESTLE FOSTERED THE CONTINUATION OF TEAMS. AND THAT IS WHEN WE THINK ABOUT QUALITY OF CARE AND MOVING FORWARD THAT IS SOMETHING THAT. WE NEED TO DO FOR NOW I THINK JUST ONE FINAL POINT- BECAUSE WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT PRIMARY CARE THIS BILL IS NOT LIMITED TO NURSE PRACTITIONERS WHO ARE THE PRIVATE CARE NURSE PRACTITIONER SPECIALIZES WHILE I WORKED WITH NURSE PRACTITIONERS WHO. ARE SPECIALISTS AND WE NEED THEM IN THE SPECIALTIES AS WELL. AND THEY WORK IN SUPERVISION WITH THE- WITH THE SPECIALTY PHYSICIANS AND- SO I DO THINK THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM THIS TO THIS. AND OUT ALSO FINALLY POINT OUT THAT WE HEARD YOU KNOW THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA HAS CONCERNS IT IS OPPOSITION. WE JUST HEARD TESTIMONY FROM THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING ABOUT THEIR CONCERNS AS WELL AND THERE HAVE BEEN OPPOSED ISN'T. THAT UNLESS AMENDED POSITION FROM THEIR TESTIMONY TODAY SO I HAD IT WITH ALL THOSE CONCERNS IT'S IN. DIFFICULT FOR ME TO. TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN. OTHER SENATORS WHO HAVE. A COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SENATE ARCHULETA MISSED. WHEN THE AUTHOR PRESENTED THE BILL SAID I ACCEPT SOME- AMENDMENTS YOU STARTED OFF EARLY IN YOUR STATEMENT- DID YOU GET RECEIVE A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS THAT. WERE PRESENTED AND THEY'VE COME TOGETHER. OR THEY ARE STILL BEING LOOKED AT WHAT'S THE STATUS OF IT THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER ARCH ALETTA IN THE ANALYSIS. TWO THINGS HAVE HAPPENED SINCE THE BILL WAS INITIALLY. REFERRED TO A COMMITTEE FIRST THE BILL WAS- AUTHORS AMENDMENTS WERE. INSERTED INTO THE BILL. AND SECONDLY- IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS OR VARIETY OF AMENDMENTS- SUGGESTED IN IS TESTIMONY. INDICATED THAT HE WOULD ACCEPT ALL OF THEM THEY BEGIN ON PAGE TWENTY. HI NUMBER NINE. AND THERE'S THREE OF THEM THAT ARE SO INDICATED THERE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD LIKE TO ADD ANYTHING TO THAT. NO IT'S JUST THAT- I WOULD LOOK AT THIS AND SORT OF THREE BUCKETS AS FAR AS YOU KNOW THE MANY THINGS THAT HAPPENED PRIOR TO AUG- AUGUST SIXTH SO AMENDMENTS THAT HAPPENED ON AUGUST SIXTH AND THEN THE AMENDMENTS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW THAT WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT WHICH ARE REALLY MINOR AND TECHNICAL IN NATURE SO THERE REALLY THERE'S REALLY NOTHING SIGNIFICANT THERE- OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT THEY CONTINUE TO CLARIFY AND STRENGTHEN THIS BILL. AND ALSO THE FURTHER SAID ARCHULETA FELL THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR CENTERS. WELL CENTER LATENCIES. OF THE BILL IS APPROPRIATE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A CENTER WOULD LEVY HELLO SORRY CENTER CHIANG YOUR QUESTION. THE PLEASE. SO I JUST WANT TO. IT'S VERY LOUD- I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT- IT THIS PARTICULAR. MEASURE HAS BEEN A REALLY TOUGH- MEASURE FOR ME. BECAUSE SCOPE OF PRACTICE BILLS INHERENTLY CREATE A CONFLICT BETWEEN TWO CRITICAL GOALS PATIENT SAFETY NEXUS CARE AND YOU KNOW I COME FROM A FAMILY OF DENTISTS AND DOCTORS. SO I'M I'M WHERE THIS- I WANTED TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT I WOULD HAVE BEEN OPPOSED TO SIMILAR MEASURES IN THE PAST FOR EXAMPLE SB THREE TWENTY THREE. YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY APPIAN P. AND IT FAILED AND BECAUSE IT WAS JUST SO IMPORTANT THAT WE NOT SACRIFICE. PATIENT SAFETY. ALSO IN THIS BILL THERE WERE NUMBER CONCERNS RAISED BY DOCTORS AND MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS THAT WEREN'T ADDRESSED IN THE BILL. BUT I GOTTA SAY THAT TIMES ARE DIFFERENT. AND YOU KNOW MAYBE MY DECISION WOULD BE DIFFERENT IF YOU KNOW WE WERE IN A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. BUT AS WE NAVIGATE THIS THIS PANDEMIC I BELIEVE WE NEED TO GIVE RENEWED ATTENTION. TO THESE CREATIVE WAYS TO CREATE MORE ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. SO UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CHAIR ON HERE IS A PROPOSAL THAT OUTLINES A PRETTY WELL CRAFTED PROCESS TO PROTECT PATIENTS AND EXPAND ACCESS TO CARE. AND I CARE I REALLY WANTED TO PUT AN EMPHASIS ON THE GUARD RAILS YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT CORD REELS FOR MANY WEEKS NOW AND WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT. YOU KNOW PATIENT PROTECTIONS. FIRST ROSE TO BE AMENDED THIS BILL ENSURES QUALITY TRAINING FOR NURSE PRACTITIONERS INCLUDING CERTIFICATION ONLY FROM ACCREDITED BOARDS. EXTENSIVE TRAINING REQUIRES AN PIEC HAVE COMPLETED THREE YEARS OF SUPERVISED PRACTICE AND AN ADDITIONAL THREE YEARS OF SUPERVISED TRANSITION TO PRACTICE BEFORE. OF PRACTICING INDEPENDENTLY UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF PHYSICIANS AND THAT SIX YEARS OF REAL LIFE TRAINING. IT REQUIRES MPS TO COMMUNICATE WITH PATIENTS ABOUT WHAT THEIR ROLE IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS THAT AND TO MENTION THAT THEY ARE NOT A PHYSICIAN THEY'RE NOT A DOCTOR. IT REQUIRES MPS TO CREATE A PLAN THAT SPECIFIES WHEN WHERE WHY AND HOW THEY WILL REFER CASES. TO A PHYSICIAN WHEN THEY'RE BEYOND THEIR LEVEL EDUCATION OR TRAINING. AND IT ESTABLISHES CLEAR DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURES. I BELIEVE THAT THESE ARE EXTENSIVE AND COMPREHENSIVE CHANGES TO PROTECT PATIENTS AND GIVE US AN IMPORTANT IMPORTANT TOOL EXPAND CARE TO THOSE MOST IN NEED. I WANT TO SAY THAT I'M A I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE WORK AND FLEXIBILITY OF THE AUTHOR. AND AGAIN THE CURRENT PANDEMIC IS CHANGING HOW WE LOOK AT THESE ISSUES AND IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE GET THIS RIGHT. I KNOW THERE'S STILL A LOT OF OPPOSITION AND I WANT TO I WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. A TO ADDRESS SOME ISSUES AND I JUST WANT TO MENTION A COUPLE OF THEM FOR EXAMPLE. ON THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE I'D LIKE TO SEE A PERCENTAGE OF PHYSICIANS ON ON THAT BOARD TO SOLIDIFY THAT SUPPORT. AND THEY'RE ALL INFLUENCE AS WELL AS MAYBE YOU KNOW FIGURE OUT THIS TRANSITION TO PRACTICE ISSUE. BUT I TRUST THE I TRUST THE AUTHOR IN THAT- YOU KNOW HE HAS BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY. WITH A VARIETY OF STAKEHOLDERS AND YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT I. I CAN CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AS THIS MOVES FORWARD SO- WITH THE WITH THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS A PRESENT BY THE CHAIR I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR. CENTER WILK I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR HISSED I I'VE BEEN ON A BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS MY ENTIRE TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE. BUT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED SINCE I'VE GOTTEN HERE IN DECEMBER TWENTY TWELVE WE'VE HAD A LOT OF THINGS HAPPEN RIGHT SO OF WE IMPLEMENTED A CA SO WE HAVE THE COVERED CALIFORNIA PROGRAM WE LOOSENED THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR MEDIC CAL SO WE'VE ADDED FIVE POINT ONE MILLION MORE PEOPLE A MEDIC CAL. AND I HAVE THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND CONSTITUENTS ON MEDICARE. NOW I HAVE BEEN SOMEBODY THAT HAS SUPPORTED INCREASING THE MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT RATES. BECAUSE THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IF YOU QUALIFY FOR THE MEDICARE CARD. ALL THAT IS A HUNTING LICENSE BECAUSE ONCE YOU HAVE THAT CARD YOU START TO FIND SOMEBODY WHO'S WILLING TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES. SO THOSE THOSE HAVE BEEN CHALLENGING- CHALLENGING WORK BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING THROUGH A WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC I BELIEVE BECAUSE OF THE GLOBALIZATION WE'RE GONNA HAVE MORE PANDEMICS. NOT LESS AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO SERVICES. HAVING SAID THAT I DO HAVE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS WITH THE BILL. THE FIRST ONE IS ABOUT I DON PAN UP UP AND OF WHAT THIS. TO THIS TRANSIT TO PRACTICE SOUNDS GREAT THREE YEARS I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THAT IS. AN THEN TO- I KNOW- CENTER DIED WE HAD A MIDWIFE BILL HE AND THAT A VICE COMPONENT TO IT. AND THERE'S A SET OF TO SEE. THAT ARE JUST ON THAT IF BOARD IF YOU LOOK AT THE- ON THIS IT IS IT IS IT IT DOES NOT NOT SPEAK TO THAT. SO I AM GOOD TO VOTE. FOR THE BILL TODAY- I DON'T THINK THIS IS FULLY COOKED IT. AND AS I SPOKE EARLIER TODAY I'M JUST TROUBLED BY THE ANTI. ENTIRE YEAR. TRUNCATED A LEGISLATIVE SESSION. THE THESE IT THIS IS A BIG POLICY ISSUE. THAT EVEN THOUGH I IN THE AUTHORS WORKED HARD AND I KNOW OTHERS HAVE WORKED HARD ON IT I DON'T THINK WE'RE THEREYET. I'M HOPING WE CAN'T BE THERE SO. I'M GOING TO GIVE MY VOTE TODAY. IN THE PARTY TO CAN. TO TAKE IT DIALOGUE BECAUSE I. THE WHOLE WE CAN CAN GET. BUT WE NEED TO HAVE GREATER. TO AND SO I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL TODAY. THANK YOU US UNDER WILK. THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD OF YOU CLOSE I'D LIKE TO SHARE A FEW THOUGHTS FROM THE SHARES TO PERSPECTIVE. BOB FIRST I I'VE IT UP. MAYBE MORE SO I THIS BILL MOST OF BILLS I DEALT WITH FIVE TO DO. DEEP INTO THE ISSUES YOU RAISE THE CALL THAT YOU HAVE LINE IN. TO DO SO IN A COUPLE. WAY NOT JUST WITH YOU BUT WITH THOSE IN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY. AND I'VE HAD NUMEROUS NUMEROUS MEETINGS WITH THE PHYSICIAN. COMMUNITY OF MY DISTRICT IN HERE- AND THEN THE CAPITAL TO UNDERSTAND AS DEEPLY AS I COULD THE CONCERNS THEY HAD ABOUT YOUR BILL. AND WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE WAYS TO IMPROVE IT AND MAKE IT BETTER AND- OBVIOUSLY- AT THIS POINT IN TIME. THAT THOSE IN THAT COMMUNITY ARE FEELING LIKE WE'VE GOT AS FAR AS WE NEED TO DO. BUT IN THE COURSE OF OUR OWN CONVERSATIONS I DID. TALK WITH YOU A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THE ISSUE OF GUARD RAILS THE WORRY ABOUT THIS IS A NEW THING AND- WE SHARE THE GOALS ALL OF US SHARE THIS THE SAME GOALS OF PATIENT SAFETY- AND WE SHARE THE SAME GOALS OF ACCESS. AND QUALITY- AND AFFORDABILITY. WELL IT WILL. WE CAN EDIT THE SAME PLACE WHICH IS A GOOD. BUT THE THAT I'VE APPRECIATED IS THAT. IN ALL THE IN WHICH I YOU TO TRY THIS. THE BILL IN THOSE PLACES. ARE THAT HAVE SHOWN A WILLINGNESS TO DO SO BOTH IN THE AMOUNT THE USE OF IT IF DAYS A- AND EXCEL THE CAN AMENDMENTS THAT WE HAVE. YOU SEND IT TO JUST REITERATES OF THOSE YOU GOT A TO AMEND THE TREND THE CALL OF THE TO. THE CREDIT REQUIRE. TO INSURING THAT. IT THERE ARE YOU GET IN EDGE. AND TRAINING THAT. THAT THE BILL FOR THE GAPS BE FILLED. WITH THE. THE AT THE BUREAU OF. ADJUSTER IN THEIR EXAM. WE THE. DC ACID THEIR STUDY OF THOSE GAPS. AND YOU TO. THE IF THERE ARE GAPS THAT THERE TO MAKE. UP THOSE. IT'S EXACTLY HOW TO FILE IT TO THE CORRECT LICENSING BOARD- TO ENSURE THAT THEY CARRY LIABILITY INSURANCE SO EVERYBODY IS PROTECTED. YOU AGREE TO AMENDMENTS TO CREATE- CLEAR GUIDELINES IN LEGISLATION ABOUT NGUYEN REFERRALS ARE REQUIRED.

VERIFIABLE HEALTH CREDENTIALS ARE PORTABLE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS THAT CAN BE VERIFIED CRYPTO GRAPHICALLY USING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY THEY PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF THE INDIVIDUAL WHILE OFFERING A TRUSTED WAY TO CONFIRM THE RESULT OF A COVERED NINETEEN TEST THIS TECHNOLOGY AND AB TWO THOUSAND FOUR SPECIFICALLY WAS ENDORSED BY THE CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS.

OF THESE CREDENTIALS IT'S SIMPLY AUTHORIZES THEM AS AN OPTION AND WILL GUIDE THEIR IMPLEMENTATION THROUGH A WORKING GROUP THAT ALLOWS FOR FLEXIBILITY IN DETERMINING. THE BEST PRACTICES AND GUIDELINES FOR USING THEM THE COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS NOTES THAT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD MAY NOT BE THE BEST SUITED TO ADMINISTER THIS PROGRAM. THIS PILOT PROGRAM I HAVE WORKED WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND- MET WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THIS ISSUE AND THE WORKING GROUP. THOSE DISCUSSIONS CONCLUDED THAT GOV OPS IS BETTER SUITED TO OVERSEE THE WORKING GROUP. GIVEN THAT THEIR EXPERTISE WITH BLOCKCHAIN AND FACILITATING WORKING GROUP'S IN GENERAL I PLAN TO AMEND THE BILL. AND APPROPRIATIONS TO REFLECT THAT AGREEMENT. AS TECHNOLOGY IMPROVES OUR POLICY SHOULD ADAPT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE IMPROVEMENTS SERVICES LIKE TELEHEALTH WERE INTRODUCED IN AUTHORIZED IN THE SAME WAY.

VERIFIABLE CREDENTIAL TECHNOLOGIES ESPECIALLY THE WAY THAT THEY WOULD BE APPLIED BY THE BILL. LIKE MANY FIRST ATTEMPT AT TECHNOLOGY ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WITH W. THREE C. VERIFIABLE CREDENTIALS IS THAT IT ASSUMES EQUAL HOW EQUAL POWER AMONG THE PARTICIPANTS AND EXCEPTIONAL POWER NEUTRALITY OR PUT ANOTHER WAY IT MIGHT BE USED TO THE WIDE DISPARITY IN POWER IN PRACTICE. BETWEEN THE PARTICIPANTS IN ANY KIND OF IDENTITY OR SECURITY RELATED SYSTEM IT IS NOT UNSUITABLE FOR GENERAL USE ESPECIALLY IN SITUATIONS WHERE THERE ARE NONE POWER IMBALANCES BUDGET BETWEEN ORTIZ LEGAL OR OTHER SUCH AS MEDICAL AND INDIVIDUALS. W. C. W. THREE C. VERIFIABLE CREDENTIALS THEY'VE BOTH. BEEN UNPROVEN TECHNOLOGY AND IGNORANT. OF AND REINFORCING. I AM HAVING DIFFICULTY THE BOTTOM IT. AT HOWARD I AM EXACERBATE HARMFUL ALLEN THAT TOWARDS COMMUNITIES THANK YOU VERY GOOD OPERATOR CAN SEE IFTHERE'S ANYBODY FURTHER WHO ONCE TESTIFIED OPPOSITION OF TWO ZERO ZERO FOUR PLEASE.

ANSWER THERE IS NOT ONE OF THANK YOU AT THIS TIME THANK YOU OPERATOR FOR YOUR GOOD WORK HELLO A CLOSE THE OPPOSITION SIDE OF THIS- THE TESTIMONY TODAY WE'RE GONNA BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM SENATORS QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SENATOR PAN I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I WANNA THANK YOU AS A MEMBER CALDERON- FOR BRING THIS ISSUE FORD F. MET I'M STILL TRYING TO SORT OF GET MY ARMS AROUND WHAT THE BILLS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH SO MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME HERE AND I'M HEARING THINGS FROM THE OPPOSITION SO FAR SO NUMBER ONE I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT. CAN YOU USE THE TECHNOLOGY TODAY ALREADY RIGHT WOULD- IN TERMS OF SPECIFICITY. NUMBER TWO I GUESS THE BILL ACTUALLY JUST BECAUSE FOR THE TASK FORCE WHICH YOU MENTIONED YOU'RE HAVING CONVERSATIONS OKAY NOW BE AMENDED TO GEO THAT SEEMS TO MAKE MORE SENSE THAN MEDICAL BOARD. BUT THEN I GUESS THE OTHER THING IS THE EXAMPLE THAT WAS GIVEN ABOUT USING THIS TECHNOLOGY WAS FOR EXAMPLE- TESTING IN THE WORKPLACE AND- WHERE YOU KNOW THEN THEY COULD SEND THE RESULTS TO PEOPLE. AND THEN IF THE- PLAYER WANTS TO BE SURE WHEN GOT TESTED AND THEY CAN SHARE THE RESULT BUT TO ME THAT ALSO ADDRESSES THE POWER DYNAMIC ISSUE THE ISSUE IS AND REALLY TO. NOTE THE PRIVACY ISSUE REALLY ISN'T THE TECHNOLOGY. IT'S THE YOU KNOW THE HUMAN SIDE OF IT RIGHT SO THE TECHNOLOGY COULD KEEP IT PRIVATE BUT IT'S BASICALLY YOU I CAN IF SOMEONE'S EMPLOYER SAYS WELL YOU KNOW IF YOU CONTINUE APPOINTMENT YOU HAVE TO SHARE THE RESULTS WITH ME. THE OBVIOUSLY TECHNOLOGY IS NOT THE BARRIER HERE IT'S NOW THIS POWER DYNAMIC IN OUT OF THAT'S WHAT THE SEAL IS REFERRING TO SO I'M JUST TRYING TO. SORT THOSE PIECES OUT. AND MAYBE CAN HELP ME WITH THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY GRAYSON DOCUMENT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOT GET CAUGHT UP OF WHAT THIS BILL ISN'T- AND- WHAT THIS BILL REALLY IS ALL IT IS THAT IT'S- PERMISSIVE. ALLOWING SOMEBODY TO. TO ENGAGE IN VERIFY ALL VERIFIABLE CREDENTIALS LIKE IN YOUR PRACTICE IF YOU WANTED TO SEND. A PATIENT A VERIFIABLE TODAY. AFTER A COVER NINETEEN TEST. THIS WOULD ALLOW YOU TO DO THAT YOU CAN DO THIS  LOT BUT IT. RIGHT NOW PEOPLE ARE DOING IT BUT THERE IS NOTHING THAT SAYS EITHER OR AND THERE IS NO STRUCTURE TO IT. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT MAKES A PERMISSIVE IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CHOOSE TO DO AS YOUR PRACTICE ON YOUR OWN. IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN DO UNDER LAW. AND IN THE PILOT PROGRAM THROUGH GABAB. SPECIFICALLY IS GOING TO PROVIDE THE STRUCTURE. BY PUTTING- DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS FROM WHETHER IT'S THE INDUSTRY CITING PRIVACY RIGHT SIDE. IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS HAPPENING IN IN THE BEST MOST SAFE- WAY. WHILE WITH A FOCUS ON PRIVACY. AND ENSURING THAT PEOPLE HAVE CONTROL AND PRIVACY- OVER THEIR OWN INFORMATION. AND YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T THIS ISN'T ABOUT DIGITAL IDEAS THIS IS JUST A FAIRY. VERY NARROW. USE CASE- AND IT ND IT'S GONNA PROVIDE SOME PROTECTIONS AND SOME GUARD RAILS AROUND. WHAT AGAIN. ALREADY DOING WHEN IT COMES TO SAY AN INDUSTRY LIKE. THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. RIGHT NOW WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE GET COMING BACK UP IN CALIFORNIA SOME FIGURED OUT SOME HAVEN'T BUT THE BIG- IDEA OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS THEY'RE CREATING THESE BUBBLES. SO YOU HAVE TO BE TESTED GOING TO COURT IN GET YOUR SALT. IN ORDER TO. ENTER INTO THAT BUBBLE TO THEN. START WORK IN TANDEM TO BE A FILMER IN AFTER WHATEVER IT IS YOU HAVE TO VERIFY THAT. YOU'RE TAKING YOUR TEST YOUR QUARANTINE OF THAT DESK. AND YOU CAN SHOW. WITHOUT ANY MUTE IMMUTABILITY THAT YOU HAVE- A NEGATIVE RESULTS SO THAT YOU'RE NOT BRINGING ANYBODY WHO HAS. THAT RESULTS THAT THEY GET A POSITIVE RESULT IN TO THE FACILITY INTO BUBBLE IN ANY. COMING IN TO WORK. IN SPECIFIC AND- SIX OF THEY CAN A- THAT IT'S COMPLETE SAFE I. CAN PROVE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO. GET THAT VERIFIABLE CREDENTIALS ARE APPROVED THAT TEST AND I COULD BE ON YOUR SMARTPHONE THAT CAN BE A Q. R. CODE THAT IS PRINTED OUT ON A PIECE OF PAPER. DEPENDING ON WHETHER YOU HAVE A SMARTPHONE OR NOT- AND IT'S SO IT'S- IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS ALREADY IN USE. WERE ALLOWING IT TO BE MORE PERMISSIVE IN LOSS OF PEOPLE CAN USE IT AND ARE PROVIDING SOME STRUCTURE TO IT. AND SO THAT'S REALLY WHERE THIS THIS FITS IN- AND PROVIDES I THINK WHAT IT THAT NECESSARY STRUCTURE IS. ALSO THE SAME TIME UNDERSTANDING THAT. THE BLOCKCHAIN WORKING GROUP- THAT I CREATED THAT IS FINISHED DELIVERED ITS REPORT TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR JUST JUST IN JULY. LOOK AT THIS THERE STAKEHOLDERS FROM WITHIN BLOCKCHAIN STAKEHOLDERS FROM AND PRIVACY RIGHTS. ADVOCACY GROUPS THAT ALL AGREED THAT THIS IS A BILL THEY NEED TO MOVE FORWARD THIS IS A BILL THAT. IS IT IS IT IS IMPORTANT TO FORWARDING THIS ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE IN CONTROL OVER THEIR INFORMATION. SPECIFICALLY AROUND CALL THE NINETEEN TESTS- AND HOW THAT INFORMATION IS DELIVERED HOW THAT INFORMATION IS USED. AND GIVING YOU THE CONTROL TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND YOU'RE VERY VIABLE POTENTIAL WALLET- HIGH REACHES. TO USE THAT INFORMATION. SARAFAN THIS A QUICK FOLLOW UP COULD YOU TALK THE EXAMPLE OF THE FILMING AND I KNOW THE ATHLETICS AND SO FOR DOING THE SAME THING SO ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE VERIFIABLE CREDENTIAL IS A WAYS THAT IF YOU GO TO EIGHT YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHO TALK IN THE FILM INDUSTRY FOR TO GET INTO ENTERED BUBBLE THAT YOU COULD THEN THAT WOULD THAT WOULD VERIFY THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY A REAL TEST RESULTS VERSUS BRING A PAPER THING SAYING HERE'S MY TEST RESULTS YEAH. OKAY EXACTLY VERIFIES THAT IT IS 1100% FROM YOUR PROVIDED A PROVIDED THAT TEST OR WHATEVER AGENCY PROVIDE THAT TO US IS THIS IS 1100% A LEGITIMATE RESULTS THAT YOU HAVE CONTROL OVER ON YOUR OWN DEVICE OR PIECE OF PAPER WHATEVER YOU CHOOSE OKAY SO IT'S OKAY IT'S ELECTRONIC WAY TO PROVIDE CREDIBLE INFORMATION OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU.

ECHO IS NEVER SOLD DOGS CATS OR RABBITS BUT WE DO PROVIDE SPACE FOR LOCAL RESCUES AND SHELTERS TO FACILITATE ADOPTIONS. ECHO DOES NOT PROVIDE PROFIT FROM THE ADOPTION. IT IS A SERVICE WE PROVIDE TO HELP PEOPLE AND PASS INTO NINETEEN LOCATIONS IN CALIFORNIA RESPONSIBLE FOR ADOPTIONS OF APPROXIMATELY FORTY TWO THOUSAND PETS. IF THIS BILL WERE TO PASS IN ITS CURRENT FORM TAKE A WOULD BE FORCED TO SEE SUPPORT PROPER DOCTRINES. IF WE WERE TO DO SO WE BELIEVE IT WOULD BE A SERIOUS DETRIMENT TO PETS IN NEED A FINDING LOVING HOMES AND IT WOULD INCREASE UNNECESSARY PET EUTHANASIA AND CALIFORNIA SHELTERS. WE HAVE SUBMITTED WRITTEN COMMENTS PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE BILL IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT ONE CHANGE IN PARTICULAR. THE BILL SHOULD EXCLUDE ANY RETAILER THAT DOES NOT TAKE A FINANCIAL. IN ADOPTION FEES. RETAILERS LIKE TESCO INCREASE SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES PROVIDING SPACE SUPPLY AND RESOURCES TO MANAGE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE ADOPTION ORGANIZATIONS.

UNLESS AMENDED AB IN NINETEEN NINETY IT IS NOT A CLARIFICATION LAST YEAR'S LEGISLATION THIS BILL SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN POLICY THE TAKES CLINICAL DECISIONS RELATED TO PATIENT CARE OUT OF THE HANDS OF CREAM CLINICIANS THE CREATES A BLANKET MANDATE REGARDING PATIENTS RECEIVE. POTENTIALLY HARMFUL IDEOGRAPHS REGARDLESS OF THE TREATING DENTIST JUDGMENT ABOUT WHETHER THEY ARE CLINICALLY NECESSARY THIS BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS PATIENT SAFETY ISSUE IT CREATES ONE THIS PROPOSED MANDATE CONTRADICTS THE PREPONDERANCE OF CLINICAL EVIDENCE NATIONAL INTERNATIONAL PIPELINES BOTH AB. DE IT'S GOING TO WITH THE CURRENT OF CAREFUL THE TREATMENT CLINICIANS MUCH BE TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT ARE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THEIR PATIENTS AND THIS BILL TAKES. AWAY. BETTER THAN NEVER BEEN TO ANY CALIFORNIA. MEDICAL PRACTICES ACT IN EVERY OTHER. TO TAKE OF X. RAYS PROCEDURE THE CAN COST LISTED HARD. TO PATIENTS THIS LEFT THE DISK OF THE DOT. WHO IS YEARS OF CLINICAL PRACTICAL X. AND THE BENEFIT OF AN INDIVIDUAL. HISTORY THAT INFORMS THE DECISION ON WHAT IS FOR THE PATIENT- YOU'RE LYING THERE SO. FIVE FIVE ONE. ZERO I'M. HELLO THEY'VE CUT ME OFF.

ME THAT'S REQUIRED BY THE HIPPOCRATIC OATH THE IMPETUS FOR THIS BILL SEEMS TO BE BASED UPON UNVERIFIED SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS CRITICAL EVIDENCE THAT SHOULD NOT BE THE BASIS FOR PUBLIC POLICY NOR CLINICAL DECISIONS DENTISTS USING REMOTE TECHNOLOGY IN CALIFORNIA- LICENSE CALIFORNIA DENTIST ARE FOLLOWING THE SAME CLINICAL STANDARDS AS THOSE PRACTICING IN TRADITIONAL BRICK AND MORTAR SETTING THIS INDUSTRY TAKE PATIENT SAFETY VERY SERIOUSLY ASSEMBLY DENNIS MUST BE IN GOOD STANDING WITH THE DENTAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA.

AS DPC NOTED THEMSELVES ANALYSIS TELL THEM THREE COMPANIES DO NOT REQUIRE ANY PATIENT SIGN NDAS A CONDITION OF GETTING TREATMENT. NOR SHOULD DAY ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL PRACTITIONER DATA BASE DISPLAY ACTION GETS CALIFORNIA LICENSEES HAS BEEN TAKEN OVER EIGHT HUNDRED TIMES. DURING THE PAST FIVE YEARS AND TO MY KNOWLEDGE NOT SINGLE ACTIONS RELATED TO PATIENT HARM TO TREAT WITH REMOTE CLEAR ALIGNER THERAPY. THIS WORKERS RESULT OF THE INDUSTRY'S FOCUS ON PATIENT SAFETY GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF REAL COMPLAINTS AND BACKLOG OF DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS OF THE DENTAL BOARD. IT SEEMS THAT THERE ARE FAR MORE PRESSING MATTERS IN THE ONE THIS BILL PURPORTS TO ADDRESS. THANK YOU I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND COULD YOU UP BECAUSE WE HAD A LITTLE CONFUSION.

MISTER CHAIR THERE'S NO ONE IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU OPERATOR WILL BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS SENATORS QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON THIS LEGISLATION. SENATOR CHIANG. YES I JUST WANTED TO SHOW MY SUPPORT FOR THE BILL LIKE I SAID BEFORE MY FAMILY WILL DENTISTS- AND SO- MY CONCERN WITH THE THESE COMPANIES THAT THEY DON'T CHECK FOR PERIODONTAL DISEASE OR BONE LOSS WHICH IS A NECESSITY IN ORTHODONTICS AND I'VE HEARD THAT SOME OF THE TEETH CAN GET PULLED OUT BY THE ALIGNERS AND SO I JUST WANT TO REITERATE MY SUPPORT VERY GOOD OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. CENTER PAN. I THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK US AND OUR LOVE FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I MEAN THIS THIS BILL IS CHALLENGING IN THE SENSE THAT- AND ONE HAND- CERTAINLY IS A HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL. WE TEND LEAN TOWARD- LEGISLATING A STANDARD OF CARE- AND USUALLY THE PROFESSIONAL SOCIETY. THIS IS THE ONE THAT DOES THAT BUT IN THIS CASE WE HAVE THE PROFESSIONAL SOCIETY ITSELF ASKING FOR THIS. I DO FIND IT UNFORTUNATE THAT THAT APPEARS THAT- LEAST- ONE OF THE OPPONENTS AGAINST THE BILL ALSO PARENTS THEY HAVE A HISTORY OF ACTUALLY TRYING TO SUE THE DENTAL BOARD EVERY TIME TO DELVE OR IS TRYING TO INVESTIGATE. WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOUR POOR OUTCOMES AND THAT'S NOT THE TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP THAT SHOULD BE HAD BETWEEN. AM BETWEEN. COMPANY DOES. IT YOUR ENGAGE WITH- DENTAL PROFESSIONALS AND INTERACT WITH THE DENTAL BOARD CERTAINLY IF THEY HAVE CONCERNS THEY SHOULD. COMMUTE BUT DUMB IT NOW CERTAINLY ZERO TO BRING LAWSUITS BUT NO WE DO HAVE A DUTY AS- SUPPORT. NO PATIENT PROTECTION AND SINCE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT DESPITE SUPPORTED BY THE DENTAL BOARD AND THE A DENTAL ASSOCIATION I CERTAINLY WILL BE IN SUPPORT. OF THIS. THANK YOU THOMAS THE QUESTIONS MEMBERS. THE HAND UP CENTER. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'D LIKE I'M GOING TO BE VOTING NO ON THIS BILL AND I'M GOING TO BE DOING IT BECAUSE THE FAIRNESS AND EQUITY IN TERMS OF FAIRNESS- THIS COMMITTEE WE DEAL A LOT IN SCOPE OF PRACTICE ISSUES INTO INTERVALS AND LAST YEAR THIS COMMITTEE IN THIS HOUSE AND LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR SIGNED AB FIFTEEN NINETEEN THAT WENT INTO EFFECT IN JANUARY ONE. OF THIS YEAR. TWENTY FIVE DAYS LATER- THIS BILL. GETS INTRODUCED. I DON'T IS APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF TIME. TO SEE IF THAT THE POLICIES THAT WE HAD IMPLEMENTED ARE IN FACT WORKING THAT'S ONE. NUMBER TWO WE ARE GIVEN A MANDATE BAYERN LEADERSHIP. THE ONLY INTRODUCED BILLS THAT HAD TO DO WITH CODED. WILDFIRES THE BUDGET IF YOU WERE TURNED OUT A LEGACY ISSUE FOR YOUR FOR YOUR DISTRICT. WE'VE HONORED THAT. THE OTHER HOUSE HAS NOT I WENT FOR TWELVE BILLS TO TWO BILLS BOTH MY BILLS PASSES HOUSE WITH NO NO VOTES WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE THEY ASK FOR IT. WENT TO THE OTHER HOUSE NOT EVEN GETTING A HEARING. SO SIR- NINE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE. WELL WERE DENIED THEIR REPRESENTATIVES ABILITY TO REPRESENT SO JUST WANT FAIRNESS WE SHOULD EVEN BE HEARING THIS BILL TODAY IN MY OPINION AND ITS SECOND SECONDLY IS EQUITY EQUITY NOT EVERYBODY CAN AFFORD THE FULL MEASURE OF GOINGTO AN ORTHODONTIST IS INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE- I LOOK AT THE DATA SAID MY DISTRICT WHICH IS A WORKING CLASS DISTRICT OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS MY CONSTITUENTS HAS SAVED TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS. SO THAT MEANS MONEY FOR FOOD BALLET LESSONS MAYBE INTO A CHILD'S COLLEGE FUND. AND IF YOU CAN AFFORD AND YOU WANT TO GO ALL IN FOR AN ORTHODONTIST THAT'S GREAT BUT NOT EVERYBODY CAN DO THAT. AND I THINK PARTICULARLY NOW WITH SOCIAL MEDIA- SO MEETINGS ARE SUPERFICIAL I THINK SOMEBODY SMILE. AFFECTS YOUR SELF ESTEEM AFFECTS OUR ABILITY TO EARN MONEY AND IMPACTS- THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE SO. I THINK AT THE PROPER THING TO DO TODAY IS NOT MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD AND LET'S SEE IF AB FIFTEEN NINETEEN WORKS AND THEN COME BACK NEXT YEAR TO ADDRESS IT IF IN FACT WENEED TO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. RIGHT SENATORS AT ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SENATOR HILL THANK YOU MATURE AND I WANT TO THINK OF THE AUTHOR AS WELL A GOOD FRIEND AND THAT SOMEONE WE'VE BEEN NUMBER TIMES THE LAST COUPLE DAYS CHATTING ABOUT THIS THIS LEGISLATION THIS BILL. AND I HAD SOME CONCERNS WITH SIMILAR TO THE SENATOR WILK EXCEPT THE FIRST PART OF HIS COMMENTS NOT THIS IS NOT THE SECOND PART OF HIS COMMENTS WERE CONCERNED ABOUT EQUITY AND THE HOUSES BUT MORE WITH THE- THE DECISION THAT WAS MADE THE LEGISLATION OF LAST YEAR. AND THE REAL QUESTION AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE MAY BE SOME PROBLEMS OR CHALLENGES IN WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF WHAT IS CONSIDERED YOU KNOW RADIO GRAFT VERSUS SOME DIAGNOSTIC DIGITAL THREE D. IMAGING THAT MAY NOT BE AS ACCURATE BUT- WHAT BECAME CLEAR TO ME WHICH THE ISSUE OF. IF THESE. THESE PATIENTS HAVE TO BE SEEN BY OR REVIEWED BY READ BY THEY ARE THEY ARE PATIENTS OF A LICENSE CALIFORNIA DENTIST AND WITH THE PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS OF CARE THAT ARE REQUIRED OF THAT DENTIST TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS DIAGNOSTIC OR WHATEVER POSITION- THERE UNDER THE- REVIEW THE DISCIPLINE AND POWER AND THE SANCTIONING TOWER OF THE DENTAL BOARD. SO IF THEY DO NOT DO THE JOB APPROPRIATELY IF THEY DO NOT DIAGNOSE CORRECTLY IF THEY DO NOT ORDER THE TESTS THAT ARE REQUIRED THE APPROPRIATE TESTS THAT ARE REQUIRED BY LAW THEN THEY SHOULD BE DISCIPLINED BY THAT BODY. AND THEY SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT. AND IF THAT'S NOT HAPPENING THEN THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE DENTAL BOARD FOR NOT PROVIDING NOT PERFORMING THEIR REQUIRED RESPONSIBILITY APPROPRIATELY. SO THAT'S THE CHALLENGE THAT I HAVE I DID NOT KNOW WHICH TWENTY FIVE DAYS AFTER THE BILL TOOK THE FACT THAT THESE CHANGES WERE FOR AN APPROACH SO. I'M JUST HAVING A STRUGGLE WITH WITH A WITH VOTING FOR THIS TODAY BECAUSE OF THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU. OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM SENATORS MR CENTER ARCHULETA. I HAVE ISSUES- WITH THE BILL ONE OF THE THINGS IS THE PATIENT AND THE INFORMED CONSENT FORM IF YOU IF YOU READ THE CLAUSE. IT SAYS THAT BY SIGNING THIS INFORMED CONSENT I MY DENTIST CLEAN MY TEETH AND AS CHECK FOR REPAIRED FOR CAVITIES LOOSE OR DEFECTIVE FILLINGS CROWNS OR BRIDGES MY GOODNESS CHECK MY LAST X. RAYS OR HAS OTHERWISE VERIFIED THAT I HAVE NO. SHORTENED OR OR OR ROOT CANAL ISSUES IMPACTED TEETH MY DENTIST HAS PROVED AND MEASURED MY DUMB POCKETS AND CONFIRM THAT I DO NOT. HAVE REGARDING THE DONE DISEASE MIGHT DENNIS PERFORMED A FULL ORAL CANCER SCREENING IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS AND CONFIRM THAT I DO NOT HAVE ORAL CANCER HOW CAN ANYONE. THE SIGN THIS WHEN TRULY THEY DIDN'T GO TO A DENTIST BEFORE THEY STARTED THE TREATMENT IN THE PROCESS AND THAT THAT'S THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES I HAVE AND THEN THE ACTUAL RELEASE WAIVER HOLD ON TO SAYS THAT THEY- AGREED NOT TO SUE THE DENNIS OR HAVE NOT SUITED DENNIS IN THE PAST. SO THERE'S TWO ISSUES HERE AND I THINK FOR THE PATIENT TO PATIENT SAFETY. WE HAVE TO RELY. ON THE PROFESSION OF DENTISTRY TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND THIS IS WHY I AM SUPPORTING THIS BILL. ALL RIGHT OTHER COMMENTS FROM CENTERS. BUT ASSEMBLY MEMBER BEFORE I ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE WE ARE HAVING STILL SOME TECHNICAL ISSUES WITH THE PHONE LINE SO I'D LIKE TO ONCE AGAIN- GIVE UP SUPPORTERS AND OPPONENTS ONE TESTIMONY VIA THE PHONE LINES ONE OF BEND OVER BACKWARDS TO. BE AS ACCOMMODATING AS WE CAN AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THE TECHNICAL CHALLENGESTHIS IS NOT EASY TO DO BUT A GREAT PROVIDES INCREDIBLE ACCESS TO ALL CALIFORNIANS TO THE WORK THAT WE DO HERE IN THE SENATE. SO OPERATOR I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU TO ASK IF ANYBODY ON THE PHONE LINES IT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OR AGAINST ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT WE WOULD INVITE THEIR TESTIMONY NOW CAN YOU ASK FOR ONCE AGAIN.

SHARE YOUR CLOSING THOUGHTS ON YOUR LARGEST IF YOU MUCH MR POSSIBLE BUT A COLLEGE OF THE DMB COMMITTEE WILL RECALL THAT- THIS CAME ABOUT THESE ISSUES CAME ABOUT BECAUSE OF THE- DENTAL BOARD SUNSET. IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER IN WHICH THEY OUTLINED A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT OUTSTANDING ISSUES A PART OF THOSE ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO CONSUMER PROTECTION AND THAT OF THE X. RAYS OF RADIO. WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT THESE COMPANIES ARE NOT COMPLYING WITH THE LAW AND THAT THEY'RE DETERMINING THAT A THREE D. IMAGING. INSTEAD OF THE COMPREHENSIVE RADIOGRAPHS AND THAT'S WHAT WE TALK ABOUT THE STANDARD OF CARE AND THAT WOULD SENATOR PENN TALKED ABOUT THAT IS IN FACT THE DENTURES THEMSELVES THAT ARE ASKING TO HAVE THIS TYPE OF STANDARDS OF CARE TO WEED OUT THE BAD ACTORS. FOR THE DENTAL BOARD TO BE ABLE TO GO AND DISCIPLINE ACCORDINGLY. BUT THAT THESE COMPANIES ARE NOT. COMPLYING WITH THE LAW ACCORDINGLY WITH THAT OF THE THREE D. IMAGING AND A GOOD. OF PREVIOUSLY MET. WITH THAT OF THE D. IMAGE NOT BEING TO LOOK AT BONES. UNDER TEETH AND TO OR ROOT CANAL ISSUES A GUM DISEASE ALIKE SO. THIS IS IN RESPONSE SPECIFICALLY TO ENSURING.
