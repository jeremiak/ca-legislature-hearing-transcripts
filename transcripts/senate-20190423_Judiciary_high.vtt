AGAINST ME THERE ARE ITEMS IN IT

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.555
BUT THOSE ARE JUST GENERAL ITEMS

00:13:42.621 --> 00:13:43.989
THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ANY

00:13:44.056 --> 00:13:45.191
KIND OF LAWSUIT.

00:13:45.257 --> 00:13:47.126
NOT JUST CONSTRUCTION DEFECT

00:13:47.193 --> 00:13:48.827

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:06.345
HEARD THOSE COMPLAINTS THAT'S

00:14:06.412 --> 00:14:07.613
WHY THE APPROVE.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.815
THE REQUIREMENT FOR THEM TO

00:14:09.882 --> 00:14:11.050
DISCLOSE THAT.

00:14:11.116 --> 00:14:12.551

ONE FIFTY AS A POSSIBILITY OF A

00:14:17.756 --> 00:14:19.792
SUBSTITUTE FOR THAT.

00:14:19.858 --> 00:14:22.394
IT'S NOT THE SAME THING. FIFTY

00:14:22.461 --> 00:14:24.330
ONE FIFTY ONLY REQUIRES A NOTICE

00:14:24.396 --> 00:14:27.233

00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:42.621
THE FAILURE TO DO SO.

00:18:42.688 --> 00:18:43.722

THAT SB FOUR TWENTY FIVE

00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:28.700
COMPLETELY BYPASSES THE PEER

00:19:28.767 --> 00:19:30.435
REVIEW PROCESS.

00:19:30.502 --> 00:19:33.138
PUT IN PLACE FOR HOSPITALS THIS

00:19:34.373 --> 00:19:35.908
WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE EXISTING

00:19:35.974 --> 00:19:38.043
PROCESS OF HAVING A PEER REVIEW

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:40.512
SYSTEM TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY

00:19:40.579 --> 00:19:41.914
SHOULD REPORT IT TO THE MEDICAL

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.315
BOARD DOESN'T WORK.

00:19:43.382 --> 00:19:44.816
AND IT IS NOT WORKABLE FOR

00:19:44.883 --> 00:19:46.919
HEALTH CLINICS ALSO IT DIDN'T

00:19:46.985 --> 00:19:48.287
WORK FOR THE LEGISLATURE.

00:19:48.353 --> 00:19:50.022
WE FINALLY CHANGE THAT IT'S NOW

00:19:50.088 --> 00:19:51.857
TIME TO EXPECT THE SAME OF OUR

00:19:51.924 --> 00:19:53.058
MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS.

00:19:53.125 --> 00:19:54.726
WE SEE MULTIPLE EXAMPLES OF

00:19:54.793 --> 00:19:56.061

00:26:46.371 --> 00:26:48.139
THEY ARE EXTREME.

00:26:48.206 --> 00:26:49.407
INTENSIVE CONFINEMENT FOR

00:26:49.474 --> 00:26:50.942
EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME

00:26:51.009 --> 00:26:52.711
EXPOSURE TO STRESSFUL AND

00:26:52.777 --> 00:26:54.713
UNFAMILIAR ENVIRONMENTS.

00:26:54.779 --> 00:26:55.847
AND TO BE SO TRAINING TECHNIQUES

00:26:55.914 --> 00:26:57.282
ALL MAKE THE CIRCUS A MISERABLE

00:26:57.349 --> 00:26:58.917
PLACE FOR ANIMALS.

00:26:58.984 --> 00:27:01.152
ANIMALS DON'T PERFORM TRICKS FOR

00:27:01.219 --> 00:27:02.520
OUR ENTERTAINMENT BECAUSE THEY

00:27:02.587 --> 00:27:03.588
WANT.

00:27:03.655 --> 00:27:04.556
TO THEY DO SO BECAUSE THEY ARE

00:27:04.622 --> 00:27:05.991
TERRIFIED OF THE CONSEQUENCES IF

00:27:06.057 --> 00:27:07.258
THEY DON'T.

00:27:07.325 --> 00:27:08.593
AS PETER HAS DOCUMENTED

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:10.895
REPEATEDLY ANIMALS IN CIRCUSES

00:27:10.962 --> 00:27:12.664
HAVE BEEN TAUGHT THROUGH VICIOUS

00:27:12.731 --> 00:27:14.366
BEATINGS BEHIND THE SCENES WHAT

00:27:14.432 --> 00:27:15.667
WILL HAPPEN TO THEM IF THEY DO

00:27:15.734 --> 00:27:16.801
NOT OBEY.

00:27:16.868 --> 00:27:17.769
AND THEY SPEND MUCH OF THEIR

00:27:17.836 --> 00:27:19.404
LIVES EVEN DAYS ON END

00:27:19.471 --> 00:27:20.772
LANGUISHING IN DARK FERRON

00:27:20.839 --> 00:27:22.107
TRAILERS.

00:27:22.173 --> 00:27:23.942
AS A RESULT OF THIS MISTREATMENT

00:27:24.009 --> 00:27:25.276
ANIMALS CAN LASH OUT IN

00:27:25.343 --> 00:27:26.644
FRUSTRATION AND MANY OF THEM

00:27:26.711 --> 00:27:28.446
HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED IN HUMAN

00:27:28.513 --> 00:27:30.482
INJURIES AND EVEN DEATHS.

00:27:30.548 --> 00:27:32.150
I HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND IN THIS

00:27:32.217 --> 00:27:34.019
WORK THE TOTAL FAILURE OF OUR

00:27:34.085 --> 00:27:36.221
EXISTING LAWS TO PROTECT THESE

00:27:36.287 --> 00:27:36.755
ANIMALS AND TO PROTECT THE

00:27:36.821 --> 00:27:39.424
PUBLIC. FOR EXAMPLE THE FEDERAL

00:27:39.491 --> 00:27:41.126
ANIMAL WELFARE ACT WHICH IS

00:27:41.192 --> 00:27:43.094
SUPPOSED TO BE ENFORCED BY THE

00:27:43.161 --> 00:27:45.330
US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.

00:27:45.397 --> 00:27:46.564
IS EFFECTIVELY A FARCE.

00:27:46.631 --> 00:27:48.533
THESE SO CALLED STANDARDS

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.168
TOTALLY FAILED TO ADDRESS THE

00:27:50.235 --> 00:27:51.936
UNIQUE SUFFERING POSED BY THE

00:27:52.003 --> 00:27:53.571

00:27:56.908 --> 00:27:58.743
IT IS ALSO WOEFULLY UNDER AND

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:00.445

00:28:05.583 --> 00:28:07.552

POLICY WE HAVE BEEN TRYING FOR

00:51:01.691 --> 00:51:04.528
SOME TIME. TO DEAL WITH KIND OF

00:51:04.594 --> 00:51:06.563
A LARGER ARCHITECTURE FROM HOW

00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:07.831
WE USED TO DEAL WITH WATER

00:51:07.898 --> 00:51:11.234
POLICY IN YEARS GONE PAST BEFORE

00:51:11.301 --> 00:51:12.602
IT WAS TAKEN A STRAW ON THE

00:51:12.669 --> 00:51:13.437
NORTH.

00:51:13.503 --> 00:51:14.337
AND STICK IN A STRONG THE

00:51:14.404 --> 00:51:15.071
COLORADO RIVER AND LET NO WATER

00:51:15.138 --> 00:51:16.573
IN SANTA BARBARA AND THAT WAS

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:19.276
OUR POLICY -- IN CALIFORNIA NOW

00:51:19.342 --> 00:51:21.211
WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WE'RE TRYING

00:51:21.278 --> 00:51:23.246
TO RE CRAFT WATER POLICY IN A

00:51:23.313 --> 00:51:25.982
WAY THAT IS MORE CONSISTENT WITH

00:51:26.049 --> 00:51:27.751
THE SUSTAINABLE GOALS THAT WE'VE

00:51:27.818 --> 00:51:29.519
BEEN TALKING ABOUT IN THE

00:51:29.586 --> 00:51:31.087
ENVIRONMENTAL SPACE.

00:51:31.154 --> 00:51:32.322
BY E. LET'S LOOK AT

00:51:32.389 --> 00:51:33.557
SUSTAINABILITY LET'S LOOK AT NEW

00:51:33.623 --> 00:51:35.625
ABILITY AND LET'S LOOK AT

00:51:35.692 --> 00:51:36.660
RECYCLING.

00:51:36.726 --> 00:51:37.627
AND SO WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH

00:51:37.694 --> 00:51:39.229
THIS BILL IS WERE BASICALLY

00:51:39.296 --> 00:51:42.265
DOING WHAT -- BYRON SHEER DID

00:51:42.332 --> 00:51:44.134
THE SOME YEARS AGO IT STARTED

00:51:44.201 --> 00:51:45.769
OUT SAN FRAN PAVLEY EXPANDED

00:51:45.836 --> 00:51:46.703
UPON IT.

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:48.839
TRYING TO CREATE OUR PS EXIT

00:51:48.905 --> 00:51:51.575
BASICALLY -- FOR WATER THAT'S

00:51:51.641 --> 00:51:54.578
BEING DISCHARGED IN THE OCEAN --

00:51:54.644 --> 00:51:55.512
WHAT WE THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A

00:51:55.579 --> 00:51:57.514
MINUTE THIS IS DEBORAH BOX ROCKS

00:51:57.581 --> 00:51:58.915
MADAM CHAIRMAN YOUR WOMAN?

00:51:58.982 --> 00:52:01.084
THE THE POINT IS THAT WE GO OUT

00:52:01.151 --> 00:52:02.986
WE TAKE THIS WATER WE USE IT

00:52:03.053 --> 00:52:04.421
ONCE WE STEAL IT FROM THE NORTH

00:52:04.488 --> 00:52:06.256
OR FROM SOME OTHER PLACE WE USE

00:52:06.323 --> 00:52:07.724
IT ONCE AND THEN WE THREE CLEAN

00:52:07.791 --> 00:52:08.725
IT UP THE FEDERAL STANDARDS AND

00:52:08.792 --> 00:52:10.260
WE THROW IN THE OCEAN.

00:52:10.327 --> 00:52:12.162
WHY DON'T WE READ CHARGE THE

00:52:12.229 --> 00:52:14.097
GROUNDWATER WATER WE RECYCLE IT

00:52:14.164 --> 00:52:15.232
AND REDUCE THE BURDEN FOR

00:52:15.298 --> 00:52:17.634
FARMERS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND

00:52:17.701 --> 00:52:19.069
FOR OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE

00:52:19.135 --> 00:52:20.403
WERE IMPORTANT WATER?

00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:21.872
SO WHAT WE DO IS WE STARTED THE

00:52:21.938 --> 00:52:24.074
DIALOGUE HERE TO START THE

00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:26.142
DISCUSSION -- OF SETTING A DATE

00:52:26.209 --> 00:52:27.210
STANDARD.

00:52:27.277 --> 00:52:30.113
FOR RECYCLING OF OF WATER JUST

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:33.650
TO GIVE YOU BY WAVES 50% BY

00:52:33.717 --> 00:52:34.985
203095% BY TWENTY FORTY CERTAIN

00:52:35.051 --> 00:52:36.553
AMERICA LOS ANGELES TO SAID HE

00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:38.154
WOULD REACH A 100% FIRST

00:52:38.221 --> 00:52:39.890
HYPERION FACILITY.

00:52:39.956 --> 00:52:40.724
AND JUST IN THE COMMITTEES I

00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:41.992
RIVERS AND LOS ANGELES WE

00:52:42.058 --> 00:52:44.427
LITERALLY USE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY

00:52:44.494 --> 00:52:45.061
THOUSAND ACRE FEET A YEAR FOR

00:52:45.128 --> 00:52:47.197
THE CITY AND WE PUT THAT MUCH

00:52:47.264 --> 00:52:48.365
JUST ONE FACILITY FOR TWO

00:52:48.431 --> 00:52:50.100
FACILITIES INTO THE OCEAN WE CAN

00:52:50.166 --> 00:52:51.701
DRAMATICALLY REACH SHAPE THE

00:52:51.768 --> 00:52:53.537
ARCHITECTURE OF HOW WATER POLICY

00:52:53.603 --> 00:52:53.904
WORKS IN.

00:52:53.970 --> 00:52:55.839
CALIFORNIA WHICH ALSO DEALS A

00:52:55.906 --> 00:52:58.208
LOT WITH THE POLITICS OF OF

00:52:58.275 --> 00:53:00.610
WATER THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM SO

00:53:00.677 --> 00:53:01.978
AND WE'VE TAKEN THE AMENDMENT

00:53:02.045 --> 00:53:04.047
RELATING TO DRY WATER YEARS TO

00:53:04.114 --> 00:53:04.748
THE MAKES SOME SENSE.

00:53:04.814 --> 00:53:05.615
LOOK YOU KNOW WE UNDERSTAND THAT

00:53:05.682 --> 00:53:07.050
ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL WITH

00:53:07.117 --> 00:53:08.585
RESPECT TO WATER POLICY BUT

00:53:08.652 --> 00:53:10.186
CERTAINLY WHAT WE DO KNOW IS

00:53:10.253 --> 00:53:11.988
THAT THERE'S AN EXTRAORDINARY

00:53:12.055 --> 00:53:12.889
AMOUNT.

00:53:12.956 --> 00:53:14.224
OF WHEELING OF WATER THAT

00:53:14.291 --> 00:53:16.092
DOESN'T NEED TO BE DONE AND WE

00:53:16.159 --> 00:53:17.661
CAN DRAMATICALLY CHANGE THE THE

AT THIS TIME.

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:03.499
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE

01:00:03.566 --> 01:00:04.901
CALIFORNIA WATER AND WASTEWATER

01:00:04.968 --> 01:00:06.502

RECYCLING IS A PROMINENT SUPPLY

01:00:36.399 --> 01:00:37.500
FACTOR IN OTHERS THERE ARE

01:00:37.567 --> 01:00:38.801
SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES FOR

EMPLOYING MORE.

01:00:40.036 --> 01:00:41.237
RECYCLED WATER AS PART OF THE

01:00:48.878 --> 01:00:49.879
IN SOME PLACES THERE'S NO

01:00:49.946 --> 01:00:51.247
STORAGE OPTIONS AND THE MANDATE

01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:52.582

ENERGY DEMAND IMPLICATIONS.

01:01:00.023 --> 01:01:02.058

01:01:02.125 --> 01:01:02.725
CONSIDERABLE WASTEWATER

01:01:02.792 --> 01:01:04.827
DISCHARGES ARE ALSO NECESSARY

01:01:04.894 --> 01:01:05.595

01:04:59.061 --> 01:05:00.229
CLARA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT

01:05:00.296 --> 01:05:01.964
OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED WE'VE

01:05:02.031 --> 01:05:03.766
TALKED AUTHORS OFFICE WE AGREE

01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:05.835
WITH THE INTENT OF THE BILL AND

01:05:05.901 --> 01:05:06.936
LOOK FORWARD.

01:05:07.003 --> 01:05:08.971
TO A LOOKING TO LOCAL

01:05:09.038 --> 01:05:09.805
COOPERATION THANK YOU.

01:05:09.872 --> 01:05:11.907
ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN

01:05:11.974 --> 01:05:13.442
OPPOSITION.

01:05:13.509 --> 01:05:15.044
BRING IT BACK TO THE DYESS.

01:05:15.111 --> 01:05:16.812
ALRIGHT WELL I HAVE A A COUPLE

01:05:16.879 --> 01:05:18.314
COMMENTS I THINK THAT -- CLEARLY

01:05:18.381 --> 01:05:19.181
FINDING WAYS TO RECYCLE WATERS

01:05:19.248 --> 01:05:20.483
IMPERATIVE TO THE STATE AND I'VE

01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:21.250
ALWAYS.

01:05:21.317 --> 01:05:23.085
BEEN SOMEONE AGHAST AT WATCHING

01:05:23.152 --> 01:05:24.787
DURING.

01:05:24.854 --> 01:05:26.389
RAINSTORMS LAWSUIT THE SO CALLED

01:05:26.455 --> 01:05:27.456
LOS ANGELES RIVER.

01:05:27.523 --> 01:05:29.325
WERE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

01:05:29.392 --> 01:05:31.360
GALLONS GO RIGHT OUT TO THE

01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:33.229
OCEAN.

01:05:33.296 --> 01:05:35.331
IN A IN AREA THAT'S A SEMI ARID

01:05:35.398 --> 01:05:36.666
DESERT SO.

01:05:36.732 --> 01:05:38.334
I'VE NEVER QUITE UNDERSTOOD THAT

01:05:38.401 --> 01:05:40.069
I I ASSUME THAT THE PART OF THE

01:05:40.136 --> 01:05:42.805
EFFORT HERE IS TO TRY TO ADDRESS.

01:05:42.872 --> 01:05:45.641
AND CAPTURE SOME OF THIS WATER

01:05:45.708 --> 01:05:48.244
THAT OTHERWISE -- BECOMES

01:05:48.311 --> 01:05:50.446
QUESTIONABLE SURFING.

01:05:50.513 --> 01:05:53.115
OF WAVES FOR PEOPLE WHO MIGHT

01:05:53.182 --> 01:05:54.350
LIKE THE HEIGHT OF THE WAGE BUT

01:05:54.417 --> 01:05:55.384
GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT'S IN THE

01:05:55.451 --> 01:05:56.952
WATER THAT THEY PROBABLY

01:05:57.019 --> 01:05:59.622
WOULDN'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT --

01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:01.724
SO -- THE QUESTION REALLY IS

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:03.426
WHAT'S THE BEST POLICY TO

01:06:03.492 --> 01:06:04.360
ACHIEVE THIS GOAL AND I THINK

01:06:04.427 --> 01:06:06.329
THAT'S BEEN THE DISCUSSION AND

01:06:06.395 --> 01:06:08.431
THE SUGGESTIONS THAT THE AUTHORS

01:06:08.497 --> 01:06:15.004
MADE HIMSELF AND I LOOK FORWARD --

01:06:15.071 --> 01:06:16.305
TO SEEING HOW THIS EVOLVES --

01:06:16.372 --> 01:06:18.107
BUT I AM CONCERNED THAT THE BILL

01:06:18.174 --> 01:06:19.308
A COULD PENALIZE LOCAL

01:06:19.375 --> 01:06:21.510
JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE MADE

01:06:21.577 --> 01:06:24.413
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS -- IT

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:25.414
ENOUGH.

01:06:25.481 --> 01:06:28.017
THE EFFORT TO WATER A TO RECYCLE

01:06:28.084 --> 01:06:29.852
AND USE EFFICIENT -- WATER

01:06:29.919 --> 01:06:32.388
EFFICIENT -- USAGES ARE AS A

01:06:32.455 --> 01:06:34.990
PRIORITY SO -- IT'S MY HOPE THAT

01:06:35.057 --> 01:06:37.026
IS THIS BILL AS THE NEGOTIATIONS

01:06:37.093 --> 01:06:40.930
CONTINUE -- THAT YOU'RE MOVING I

01:06:40.996 --> 01:06:41.630
THINK IT MOVES IN THE RIGHT

01:06:41.697 --> 01:06:42.832
DIRECTION I THINK THERE HAS TO

01:06:42.898 --> 01:06:45.234
BE A GREATER FLEXIBILITY HERE

01:06:45.301 --> 01:06:48.804
WORKING WITH THOSE WHO -- HAVE --

01:06:48.871 --> 01:06:50.406
PURSUED WHAT WERE I UNDERSTAND

01:06:50.473 --> 01:06:53.309
TO BE LEGITIMATE AND ACCEPTED

01:06:53.376 --> 01:06:54.810
APPROACHES BUT NOW.

01:06:54.877 --> 01:06:55.745
THERE'S CONCERN THAT THEY MAY

01:06:55.811 --> 01:06:57.513
NOT BE AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S

01:06:57.580 --> 01:07:05.855
WHAT YOU INTEND IN THE BILL SO --

01:07:05.921 --> 01:07:07.890
I'M HOPING THAT -- IT THE TRUE

01:07:07.957 --> 01:07:09.759
WILL -- TAKE INTO ACCOUNT.

01:07:09.825 --> 01:07:10.626
OF THE DIFFERENT CONCERNS THAT

01:07:10.693 --> 01:07:11.761
HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED HERE AND I'D

01:07:11.827 --> 01:07:13.062
LIKE TO RESERVE THE RIGHT TO

01:07:13.129 --> 01:07:13.562
PULL THE BILL BACK IF.

01:07:13.629 --> 01:07:17.099
IF -- IF IT WOULD BE OUR UNFAIR

01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:18.300
TO FIND YOU KNOW IF WE FIND

01:07:18.367 --> 01:07:20.436
WATER AND SANITATION AGENCIES

01:07:20.503 --> 01:07:21.971
FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO MEET WHAT

01:07:22.037 --> 01:07:24.073
BECOMES AN IMPOSSIBLE STANDARD.

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:25.608
I KNOW THAT ISN'T WHAT YOU

01:07:25.674 --> 01:07:26.642
INTEND BUT I WOULD LIKE.

01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:27.743
TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO

01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:30.846
MONITOR THIS SO WE CAN ADDRESS I

01:07:30.913 --> 01:07:31.947
THINK SOME OF THE LEGITIMATE

01:07:32.014 --> 01:07:33.249
CONCERNS AT THE SAME TIME I

01:07:33.315 --> 01:07:34.817
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE.

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:36.619
WORKING TOWARD IN TRYING TO MAKE

01:07:36.685 --> 01:07:37.653
SURE NICE ADDRESS SPECIFICALLY

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:38.621
BECAUSE WE SPENT A YEAR AND A

01:07:38.687 --> 01:07:39.822
HALF ON PRECISELY THAT ISSUE

01:07:39.889 --> 01:07:41.223
WITH RESPECT WATER CONSERVATION

01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:43.025
WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN ON

01:07:43.092 --> 01:07:44.660
THE TWO BILLS THAT WE DID LAST

01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:45.728
YEAR.

01:07:45.795 --> 01:07:47.797
WE BASICALLY -- CODIFYING WITH

01:07:47.863 --> 01:07:48.531
THE GOVERNOR DID HIS EXECUTIVE

01:07:48.597 --> 01:07:49.932
ORDER WITH RESPECT TO

01:07:49.999 --> 01:07:52.368
CONSERVATION IS A WAY OF LIFE.

01:07:52.435 --> 01:07:53.536
AND THE BIGGEST ISSUE WITH --

01:07:53.602 --> 01:07:54.170
DEBATED A THAT WAS WHETHER OR

01:07:54.236 --> 01:07:55.404
NOT WE GIVE CREDIT FOR RECYCLED

01:07:55.471 --> 01:07:57.506
WATER WE ULTIMATELY CAME DOWN TO

01:07:57.573 --> 01:07:59.942
GET 15% CREDIT FOR RECYCLED

01:08:00.009 --> 01:08:00.509
WATER.

01:08:00.576 --> 01:08:01.444
THE AGENCIES THAT IN FACT DID

01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:02.378
THE RIGHT THING THAT WERE

01:08:02.445 --> 01:08:03.813
ALREADY IN THE GAME FOR PURPOSES

01:08:03.879 --> 01:08:05.281
OF CONSERVATION SO CLEARLY I

01:08:05.347 --> 01:08:06.515
COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU AND

01:08:06.582 --> 01:08:08.484
THAT WAS THE CORNERSTONE OF

01:08:08.551 --> 01:08:09.885
THOSE.

01:08:09.952 --> 01:08:12.021
BIG DEBATES AND WE LOST SOME

01:08:12.087 --> 01:08:16.659
PEOPLE AT THIS TABLE IN THAT

01:08:16.725 --> 01:08:19.328
DEBATE -- IN THAT DAY AND

01:08:19.395 --> 01:08:19.995
SECONDLY YOU JUST THE POINT WITH

01:08:20.062 --> 01:08:20.863
RESPECT TO THE DISCHARGE AND

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.198
BRIAN THE BILL SPECIFICALLY SAYS

01:08:22.264 --> 01:08:24.033
IS TO FIND THE AVERAGE ANNUAL

01:08:24.099 --> 01:08:25.334
WASTEWATER DISCHARGE BASELINE

01:08:25.401 --> 01:08:27.436
VOLUME. TWO WHICH WAS REFERRED.

01:08:27.503 --> 01:08:28.804
HE TALKS ABOUT VOLUME OF TREATED

01:08:28.871 --> 01:08:30.339
WASTEWATER.

01:08:30.406 --> 01:08:31.740
MEANING THAT YOU'VE TREATED IT

01:08:31.807 --> 01:08:33.676
YOU ALREADY GOING TO THE EXPENSE

01:08:33.742 --> 01:08:36.278
OF TREATING THIS STUFF IS GOING

01:08:36.345 --> 01:08:37.613
TO THE FACILITIES IT'S MET

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.648
FEDERAL STANDARDS THAT WERE

01:08:39.715 --> 01:08:42.685
TAKEN IT'S GOOD WATER AMBUSH.

01:08:42.751 --> 01:08:45.254
ROLE IN THE OCEAN LET ALONE

01:08:45.321 --> 01:08:46.455
DRIVE IN THE AND THAT THAT THE

01:08:46.522 --> 01:08:47.456
YEAR THEORIES OF THE STORM WATER

01:08:47.523 --> 01:08:49.492
THAT'S A BIGGER ISSUE WHICH I AM

01:08:49.558 --> 01:08:50.726
KEENLY INTERESTED BECAUSE WE

01:08:50.793 --> 01:08:51.594
JUST PASSED IS TO GET A TAX

01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:52.761
MEASURE. TO PUT A BUNCH MORE

01:08:52.828 --> 01:08:54.029
WATER IN THE OCEAN WHICH I

01:08:54.096 --> 01:08:55.531
WASN'T VERY HAPPY ABOUT HAPPY TO

01:08:55.598 --> 01:08:56.632
CLEAN IT UP BUT SURE GOING TO

01:08:56.699 --> 01:08:58.200
YOUR SURFING ISSUE WOULD LIKE TO

01:08:58.267 --> 01:08:59.502
CAPTURE IT.

01:08:59.568 --> 01:09:01.670
AND WE CHARGE THE GROUNDWATER SO

01:09:01.737 --> 01:09:02.238
I THINK THAT KIND OF IT BUT

01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:03.138
YOU'RE I GET IT YOU'RE EXACTLY

01:09:03.205 --> 01:09:04.840
RIGHT AND WE'RE REALLY ON IT

WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH A LONG

01:09:05.508 --> 01:09:05.641
TIME.

01:09:05.708 --> 01:09:06.976
IT IS THE CRUX OF THE ISSUE.

01:09:07.042 --> 01:09:09.078
AND IF I COULD JUST ASK THE

01:09:09.144 --> 01:09:12.581

01:09:16.118 --> 01:09:16.919
TREATED WASTEWATER.

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:19.388
A IS IT YOUR POSITION THAT THAT

01:09:19.455 --> 01:09:21.156
STILL DOESN'T THE ADDRESS YOUR

01:09:21.223 --> 01:09:22.791
CONCERN IT DOES NOT ADDRESS OUR

01:09:22.858 --> 01:09:24.994
CONCERNS AND MOVING FORWARD WE

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:26.428

01:09:26.495 --> 01:09:27.730
INCLUDES BRINE IT WOULD NEED TO

01:09:27.796 --> 01:09:30.032
SEE THAT EXPRESSLY CLARIFIED IN

01:09:30.099 --> 01:09:31.867
THE BILL BUT EVEN IF IT WERE I

01:09:31.934 --> 01:09:32.801
THINK.

THE THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL --

01:11:12.501 --> 01:11:13.902
LITIGATION PROBLEM AND AND MONEY

THAT WILL HAVE TO BE SPENT BY

01:11:16.071 --> 01:11:18.107
OUR WATER AGENCIES.

01:11:18.173 --> 01:11:19.975
TO ADDRESS THE THE SECRET

01:11:20.042 --> 01:11:21.010
LOCATIONS ASSOCIATE WITH THESE

01:11:21.076 --> 01:11:21.744
ENORMOUS INFRASTRUCTURAL

01:11:21.810 --> 01:11:23.846
PROJECTS TO GET TO WHERE WE WANT

01:11:23.912 --> 01:11:25.347
TO GET.

01:11:25.414 --> 01:11:26.782
AND SO I'D LOVE TO GET YOUR

01:11:26.849 --> 01:11:27.516
THOUGHTS ON THAT IT'S MENTIONED

01:11:27.583 --> 01:11:32.821
IN THE THE MINORITY ANALYSIS.

01:11:32.888 --> 01:11:34.089
YEAH.

01:11:34.156 --> 01:11:36.091
BUT BASICALLY ANY THE BROAD

01:11:36.158 --> 01:11:37.860
TERMS COMPARED WE WORKERS IF YOU

01:11:37.926 --> 01:11:39.061
RECALL SOME YEARS AGO WAS

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:40.396
REFERENCE I HAVE USED A BILL

01:11:40.462 --> 01:11:41.030
MAKING IT ILLEGAL TO PUT WATER

01:11:41.096 --> 01:11:41.363
IN THE OCEAN.

01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:42.898
JUST TO GET THE WATER COMMITTEES

01:11:42.965 --> 01:11:43.899
ATTENTION IN THIS ISSUE BUT

01:11:43.966 --> 01:11:44.700
BASICALLY WE'RE TRYING TO

01:11:44.767 --> 01:11:45.934
IMPLEMENT IS WITH THE STATE

01:11:46.001 --> 01:11:48.637
WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD'S

01:11:48.704 --> 01:11:49.238
TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN RECYCLE

01:11:49.304 --> 01:11:49.905
PLANS ARE.

01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:51.306
SO I THINK WHAT YOU SEEN IN THIS

01:11:51.373 --> 01:11:53.308
MEASURE ALTHOUGH THERE'S ALWAYS

01:11:53.375 --> 01:11:55.244
WORK TO BE DONE AS STRESSED.

01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:56.278
THAT WE REALLY ARE TRYING TO

01:11:56.345 --> 01:11:57.546
FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THIS THING

01:11:57.613 --> 01:11:59.515
DONE YOU KNOW ALL I CAN TELL YOU

01:11:59.581 --> 01:12:00.783

DISSERTATION IN COLLEGE ON WATER.

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:05.454
AND I IN EVERYONE OF THESE

01:12:05.521 --> 01:12:07.222
MEASURES IS NEVER BEEN SUPPORTED

01:12:07.289 --> 01:12:08.724
BY THE WATER COMMUNITY IT'S JUST

01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:10.225
THE NATURE OF HOW IT WORKS

01:12:10.292 --> 01:12:11.660
THERE'S ALWAYS AN ISSUE THERE'S

01:12:11.727 --> 01:12:13.429
ALWAYS A PROBLEM IS ALWAYS A

01:12:13.495 --> 01:12:14.229
LOCAL DISTRICT.

01:12:14.296 --> 01:12:15.097
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THEY'RE

01:12:15.164 --> 01:12:17.066
WRONG IT'S JUST IT'S A IT'S A

01:12:17.132 --> 01:12:19.535
WORLD WATER WORLD IS.

01:12:19.601 --> 01:12:21.737
THE GERMANS FOR THE NATURAL

01:12:21.804 --> 01:12:23.305
RESOURCES LEARNING THEIR ZONE

01:12:23.372 --> 01:12:24.573
PROCLIVITIES IN ITS OWN

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:25.974
UNIQUENESS IS AND I'VE NEVER AT

01:12:26.041 --> 01:12:27.309
THE THE CONSERVATION MEASURES

01:12:27.376 --> 01:12:29.545
THAT WE PASSED TO VEHEMENTLY

01:12:29.611 --> 01:12:30.846
OPPOSED BY AQUA.

01:12:30.913 --> 01:12:32.481
SAME PEOPLE SAME GROUPS SAME

01:12:32.548 --> 01:12:35.017
OPPONENTS SAME ARGUMENTS YOU

01:12:35.084 --> 01:12:35.884
KNOW IN THE ONLY I WOULD SAY ON

01:12:35.951 --> 01:12:36.752
TIE THIS INTO MY CLOSES YOU KNOW

01:12:36.819 --> 01:12:38.454
I REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE TALKING

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:40.622
ABOUT A 20% RBS.

01:12:40.689 --> 01:12:41.724

DISAGREE THE I THINK WE HAVE TO

01:12:48.664 --> 01:12:49.198
KEEP PUSHING I BELIEVE I'VE.

01:12:49.264 --> 01:12:50.399
PUSH ALL THE TIME ON THESE KINDS

01:12:50.466 --> 01:12:52.401
OF ISSUES -- BUT BUT JUST

01:12:52.468 --> 01:12:54.069
BECAUSE THERE WAS OPPOSITION

01:12:54.136 --> 01:12:55.637
THEIR PS WE WE HAD TO PUT IN

01:12:55.704 --> 01:12:56.672
PLACE.

01:12:56.739 --> 01:12:57.706
SOME PROTECTIONS AND AND SOME

01:12:57.773 --> 01:12:59.141
PLAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:01.376
WOULD BE A REASONABLE ROAD MAP

01:13:01.443 --> 01:13:02.745
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC

01:13:02.811 --> 01:13:04.279
AGENCIES HERE RIGHT THESE ARE

01:13:04.346 --> 01:13:06.415
THE FOLKS THAT THE PUBLIC IN THE

01:13:06.482 --> 01:13:08.817
TAXPAYERS -- HOLD ACCOUNTABLE

01:13:08.884 --> 01:13:10.419
FOR PROVIDING IMPORTANT CLEAN

01:13:10.486 --> 01:13:11.053
WATER SERVICES TO OUR

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.855
COMMUNITIES ARE STRUGGLING TO DO

01:13:12.921 --> 01:13:14.289
SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE WHOLE

01:13:14.356 --> 01:13:15.124
DEBATE WITH.

01:13:15.190 --> 01:13:16.592
A YEAR ON MINING SITTING TALKING

01:13:16.658 --> 01:13:19.561
RIGHT NOW -- SO YOU KNOW HOWDO

01:13:19.628 --> 01:13:22.998
WE I GUESS THE QUESTION IS WITH

01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:24.399
WITH THIS SIX AT NOT DIE I

01:13:24.466 --> 01:13:25.167
APPRECIATE THAT YOUR FRIEND A

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:26.101
PAST EFFORTS BUT WHAT IN THIS

01:13:26.168 --> 01:13:27.002
BILL.

01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:28.070
IS GOING TO HELP ADDRESS THE

01:13:28.137 --> 01:13:40.749
ENORMOUS LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES --

01:13:40.816 --> 01:13:43.018
ASSOCIATE WITH WHAT YOU'RE

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:44.353
CALLING FOR TWENTY YEAR TIME

01:13:44.419 --> 01:13:45.154
FRAME BUILT IN TO GIVE US AN

01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:46.889
OPPORTUNITY TO COURSE CORRECT

01:13:46.955 --> 01:13:47.556
AND LEARN TO THE PROCESS.

01:13:47.623 --> 01:13:48.323
BUT TO AT LEAST START WITH THE

01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:49.925
FRAMEWORK OF WHAT OUR OBJECTIVE

01:13:49.992 --> 01:13:50.526
IS AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU

01:13:50.592 --> 01:13:51.059
CAN DO IT.

01:13:51.126 --> 01:13:52.494
SO WE LITERALLY DON'T MEET OUR

01:13:52.561 --> 01:13:54.797
TALK ABOUT FINAL TARGETS UNTIL.

01:13:54.863 --> 01:13:55.464
TWENTY FORTY AND IN AND THAT TO

01:13:55.531 --> 01:13:56.598
ME I THINK IS THE BEST AND MOST

01:13:56.665 --> 01:13:57.132
REASONABLE ANSWER TO YOUR

01:13:57.199 --> 01:13:58.033

01:13:59.668 --> 01:14:00.269
ROADBLOCKS AND BUMPS IN THE ROAD.

01:14:00.335 --> 01:14:01.203
AND HENCE WE WILL HAVE A FULL

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:01.737
TIME LEGISLATURE THAT WILL

01:14:01.804 --> 01:14:03.438
CONTINUE TO WORK TO FIGURE OUT

01:14:03.505 --> 01:14:04.206
THOSE IN THE PROCESS.

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:05.407
BUT THIS IS THE POINT IN THE

01:14:05.474 --> 01:14:06.975
ROAD WHERE I THINK WE NEED TO

01:14:07.042 --> 01:14:08.844
START GIVEN THAT WE'VE THIS IS

01:14:08.911 --> 01:14:10.512

TO WHICH I THINK YOU'RE

01:14:26.862 --> 01:14:29.565

01:17:20.769 --> 01:17:22.037
SUPREME COURT PUBLISHED ITS

01:17:22.104 --> 01:17:23.739
RULING IN THE CASE OF PEOPLE

01:17:23.805 --> 01:17:25.140
VERSUS SANCHEZ.

01:17:25.207 --> 01:17:27.075
THE CASE CAME OUT OF MY COUNTY

01:17:27.142 --> 01:17:28.744
SUPERIOR COURT WITH MY GOOD

01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:30.345

PRESIDING -- FORMER MAYOR

ACTUALLY OF NEWPORT BEACH.

01:17:33.515 --> 01:17:34.616
IT COMPLETELY CHANGED AN

01:17:34.683 --> 01:17:35.584
ATTORNEY'S ABILITY TO PRESENT

01:17:35.650 --> 01:17:37.586
HEARSAY EVIDENCE THROUGH EXPERT

01:17:37.652 --> 01:17:38.387
TESTIMONY.

01:17:38.453 --> 01:17:39.688
I TRIED TO ADDRESS -- THIS

01:17:39.755 --> 01:17:43.825
CHANGE LAST YEAR WITH SB TWELVE

01:17:43.892 --> 01:17:44.393
SEVENTY SIX BUT WE NEED MORE

01:17:44.459 --> 01:17:45.260
TIME.

01:17:45.327 --> 01:17:47.696
WHEN DID SOME WORK -- IN THE

01:17:47.763 --> 01:17:48.630
BREAK AND HAD SOME FUN PUTTING.

01:17:48.697 --> 01:17:50.632
THIS TOGETHER AS IT RELATESTO

01:17:50.699 --> 01:17:53.668
DEALING WITH FAMILY LAW CASES.

01:17:53.735 --> 01:17:54.903
FOR A PERIOD OF TIME DURING MY

01:17:54.970 --> 01:17:56.304
COUNTY PRACTICE DAYS I SERVED AS

01:17:56.371 --> 01:17:58.040
AN EXPERT WITNESS IN DIVORCE

01:17:58.106 --> 01:17:59.241
CASES.

01:17:59.307 --> 01:18:00.542
ASSISTING A SPOUSE IN AMERICA

01:18:00.609 --> 01:18:02.044
THE SOLUTION THE OLD CLASSIC

01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:02.944
FORENSIC ACCOUNTING WHERE I

01:18:03.011 --> 01:18:04.279
WOULD REVIEW THEBOOKS AND

01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:05.280
RECORDS.

01:18:05.347 --> 01:18:07.949
OF A OF THE THE BUSINESS OWNER

01:18:08.016 --> 01:18:09.584

01:18:09.651 --> 01:18:11.253
STREAMS OVERHEAD COSTS AND

01:18:11.319 --> 01:18:12.621
VALUATIONS.

01:18:12.687 --> 01:18:14.156
I WOULD TESTIFY IN COURT AND I

01:18:14.222 --> 01:18:15.123
WOULD PROVIDE WRITTEN STATEMENTS

01:18:15.190 --> 01:18:17.959
AND THIS IS JUST BASIC HEARSAY

01:18:18.026 --> 01:18:19.561
EVIDENCE.

01:18:19.628 --> 01:18:21.430
THE SANCHEZ CASE.

01:18:21.496 --> 01:18:22.431
HAS STOPPED THE USE OF EXPERT

01:18:22.497 --> 01:18:23.432
WITNESSES NOW THE ACTUAL

01:18:23.498 --> 01:18:24.499
EVIDENCE NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT

01:18:24.566 --> 01:18:26.501
INTO THE COURTROOM INCLUDING

01:18:26.568 --> 01:18:27.169
BANK STATEMENTS AND RELATED

01:18:27.235 --> 01:18:29.271
RECORDS. ONE RECENT CASE AN

01:18:29.337 --> 01:18:32.641
ORANGE COUNTY ALONE REQUIRED ONE

01:18:32.707 --> 01:18:33.742
HUNDRED THOUSAND PAGES OF

01:18:33.809 --> 01:18:34.242

01:18:34.309 --> 01:18:35.710
COURTROOM.

01:18:35.777 --> 01:18:37.879
COLLEAGUES THIS IS EXPENSIVE.

01:18:37.946 --> 01:18:39.881
AND ON OCCASION IT'S RETALIATORY

01:18:39.948 --> 01:18:41.416
BEHAVIOR WHAT MAKES IT MORE

01:18:41.483 --> 01:18:43.518
FRUSTRATING IS THAT THERE IS NO

01:18:43.585 --> 01:18:45.220
JURY IN A DIVORCE CASE.

01:18:45.287 --> 01:18:46.688
PARTY'S APPEAR BEFORE JUDGE.

01:18:46.755 --> 01:18:48.223
THE FEAR OF CONFUSING THE JURY

01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:50.225
IS NOT APPLICABLE.

01:18:50.292 --> 01:18:52.427
SB FOUR THREE FIVE EXEMPTS THE

01:18:55.664 --> 01:18:57.532
BILL SHOULD REDUCE DELAYS AND

01:18:57.599 --> 01:18:58.166
COSTS.

01:18:58.233 --> 01:18:59.634
NOT ALLOWING A EXPERT WITNESS

01:18:59.701 --> 01:19:01.069
LIKE A PSYCHIATRIST MAKES

01:19:01.136 --> 01:19:02.471
PRESENTING EVIDENCE ON MENTAL

01:19:12.514 --> 01:19:13.915

REGARDING THE RULES OF EVIDENCE

01:19:19.121 --> 01:19:20.789
FOR JUDGES WHO ARE BETTER ABLE

01:19:20.856 --> 01:19:22.124

01:23:36.444 --> 01:23:38.279
PROVIDING AN ADVANTAGE TO ONE

01:23:38.346 --> 01:23:39.581
PARTY BY ALLOWING THAT PARTY TO

01:23:39.647 --> 01:23:40.682
PUSH THROUGH REPORTS IN

01:23:40.749 --> 01:23:42.717
INFORMATION BENEFICIAL TO THAT

01:23:42.784 --> 01:23:44.152
PARTY BY AVOIDING THE FAIR AND

01:23:44.219 --> 01:23:45.987
TESTED RULES OF EVIDENCE IN HERE

01:23:46.054 --> 01:23:46.888
SAY.

01:23:46.955 --> 01:23:48.556
COULD SPEED THINGS UP BUT

01:23:48.623 --> 01:23:50.058
WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING EVIDENT

01:23:50.125 --> 01:23:52.761
AN EMPHASIS ON WHAT IS JUST.

01:23:52.827 --> 01:23:53.828
AND BY BURDENING THE COURT WITH

01:23:53.895 --> 01:23:55.697
INFORMATION THAT CANNOT BE

01:23:55.764 --> 01:23:57.298
CHECKED OR VERIFIED.

01:23:57.365 --> 01:24:02.003
THIS LIMITS THE ROLE OF FORTY IN

01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:03.171
DISCRETION OF THE JUDGE.

01:24:03.238 --> 01:24:04.172
THE VAST MAJORITY BETWEEN EIGHTY

01:24:04.239 --> 01:24:06.841
FIVE AND 95% OF FAMILY LAW LET.

01:24:06.908 --> 01:24:08.843
ARE UNREPRESENTED AND THAT MEANS

01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:10.779
BOTH PARTIES ARE ON REPRESENTED

01:24:10.845 --> 01:24:11.880
THE STATED NEED FOR HEARSAY

01:24:11.946 --> 01:24:13.615
EXCEPTIONS IS EMBODIED IN THIS

01:24:13.681 --> 01:24:14.983
BILL THEN IN NEWER TO THE

01:24:15.049 --> 01:24:16.951
BENEFIT OF A FRACTION OF FAMILY

01:24:17.018 --> 01:24:18.420
LAW LITIGANTS.

01:24:18.486 --> 01:24:20.054
NAMELY THOSE WITH MEANS IT IS

01:24:20.121 --> 01:24:22.023
THE AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES

01:24:22.090 --> 01:24:23.958
THEN THE ABILITY TO LITIGATE AT

01:24:24.025 --> 01:24:24.826
ALL.

01:24:24.893 --> 01:24:26.294
AND MORE STRATEGICALLY THE

01:24:26.361 --> 01:24:28.463
FINANCIAL CAPACITY TO AUTHORIZE

01:24:28.530 --> 01:24:30.498
REPORTS AND PUSH FOR THEIR

01:24:30.565 --> 01:24:31.766
ADMISSION INTO EVIDENCE THAT

01:24:31.833 --> 01:24:34.302
MAKES FAMILY COURT PROCEEDINGS

01:24:34.369 --> 01:24:38.373
TAKE A LONG TIME.

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:39.374
NEXT WITNESS.

01:24:39.441 --> 01:24:40.008
OUR DRIVER GONE WE HAVE FOR THE

01:24:40.074 --> 01:24:42.143
CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION

01:24:42.210 --> 01:24:43.878
AND FIRST I WANT TO SAY WE ALIGN

01:24:43.945 --> 01:24:45.180
OURSELVES WITH THE JUDICIAL

01:24:45.246 --> 01:24:46.948
COUNCIL AND ALL THE CONCERNS

01:24:47.015 --> 01:24:49.117
THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN RAISED.

01:24:49.184 --> 01:24:51.352
AND WILL EMPHASIZE ON THAT CARD

01:24:51.419 --> 01:24:53.655
NUMBER ONE CONCERN IS THAT

01:24:53.721 --> 01:24:55.089
FAMILY LAW THAT AGAINST WILL BE

01:24:55.156 --> 01:24:56.991
TREATED DIFFERENTLY THAN OTHER

01:24:57.058 --> 01:24:58.393
LEAD AGAINST EVEN WITHIN THE

01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:00.128
CIVIL SYSTEM OF WHICH FAMILY LAW

01:25:00.195 --> 01:25:02.330
IS FOUND.

01:25:02.397 --> 01:25:04.732
AND THE FAMILY LAW LITIGANTS ARE

01:25:04.799 --> 01:25:07.001
ENTITLED TO THE SAME PROTECTIONS

01:25:07.068 --> 01:25:07.836
AS OTHER LITIGANTS IN THE LAW.

01:25:07.902 --> 01:25:10.672
AND AS ANY ALSO MENTION THE HIGH.

01:25:10.738 --> 01:25:12.040
THE HIGH AMOUNT OF LITIGANTS

01:25:12.106 --> 01:25:13.541
THAT ARE UNDER REPRESENTED IN

01:25:13.608 --> 01:25:15.977
THIS AREA FURTHER SHOWS WHY

01:25:16.044 --> 01:25:17.612
THESE EVIDENTIARY PROTECTIONS

01:25:17.679 --> 01:25:20.048
ARE NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE

01:25:20.114 --> 01:25:20.381
LEAD AGAINST.

01:25:20.448 --> 01:25:23.084
AND WELL WE'RE WE'RE WILLING TO

01:25:23.151 --> 01:25:24.352
WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR

01:25:24.419 --> 01:25:25.820
TO DISCUSS THEIR ISSUE BUT WE

01:25:25.887 --> 01:25:28.490
FEEL THAT AS BEFORE THIRTY FIVE

01:25:28.556 --> 01:25:29.390
IS TOO BROAD.

01:25:29.457 --> 01:25:31.493
GIVEN THE THE PRIORITIES THAT

01:25:31.559 --> 01:25:33.428
ARE AT STAKE ADDITIONAL CONCERNS

01:25:33.495 --> 01:25:34.629
THAT WE'VE OUTLINED IN THE

01:25:34.696 --> 01:25:36.297
LETTER DEAL THAT WERE ALSO

01:25:36.364 --> 01:25:37.966
POINTED OUT IN THE ANALYSIS DEAL

01:25:38.032 --> 01:25:39.734
WITH THE SHIFTING OF THE BURDEN.

01:25:39.801 --> 01:25:42.604
THIS IS YOU KNOW AND WE ARE

01:25:42.670 --> 01:25:44.439
UNFAMILIAR WITH ANY AREA OTHER

01:25:44.506 --> 01:25:45.206
AREA AND THE LAW WHERE THE

01:25:45.273 --> 01:25:46.207
BURDEN WOULD SHIFT TO THE

01:25:46.274 --> 01:25:48.309
OPPONENT. TO PROVE THAT THE

01:25:48.376 --> 01:25:49.911
EVIDENCE IS HEARSAY AND

01:25:49.978 --> 01:25:52.747
THEREFORE UNRELIABLE -- ALSO

01:25:52.814 --> 01:25:53.781
MANY OF THESE REPORTS ARE

01:25:53.848 --> 01:25:57.318
PREPARED BY PRIVATE EXPERTS PAID

01:25:57.385 --> 01:25:59.554
FOR BY ONE OF THE PARTIES SO.

01:25:59.621 --> 01:26:01.189
IF THEY ARE PAID FOR THE REPORT

01:26:01.256 --> 01:26:02.156
THEY'VE PAID FOR THE

01:26:02.223 --> 01:26:04.025
REPRESENTATION AND THEN TO HAVE

01:26:04.092 --> 01:26:05.460
THE UNREPRESENTED PARTY BE

01:26:05.527 --> 01:26:07.295
FORCED TO GOING TO COURT AND

01:26:07.362 --> 01:26:08.630
THEN AGAIN.

01:26:08.696 --> 01:26:10.164
OPPOSE CERTAIN PARTS OF THE

01:26:10.231 --> 01:26:12.433
REPORT AS HEARSAY WITHOUT

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:14.168
ACTUALLY HAVING THE INFORMATION

01:26:14.235 --> 01:26:16.671
NECESSARY TO PROVE THAT.

01:26:16.738 --> 01:26:19.040
AND SO SHIFTING THE BURDEN AND

01:26:19.107 --> 01:26:21.175
THEN FINALLY -- THE REPORTS

01:26:21.242 --> 01:26:22.510
ACCESSIBLE I KNOW I'VE NEVER

01:26:22.577 --> 01:26:24.979

01:30:12.273 --> 01:30:14.008
HIGHER INCOME PARENT.

01:30:14.075 --> 01:30:15.743
BECAUSE OF THAT PARENT OR SPOUSE

01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:18.780

LOWER INCOME SPOUSE TURNS TO

01:30:26.487 --> 01:30:27.054
THEIR ATTORNEY.

THEIR ATTORNEY SAYS I NEED TWO

01:30:29.957 --> 01:30:30.491

01:30:33.528 --> 01:30:34.896
TRADITIONAL CIVIL ACTIONS

CONTRACTUAL ISSUES YOU'RE

AND BECAUSE OF THAT THE VERY

01:30:42.937 --> 01:30:44.906
NATURE OF WHAT IS AT STAKE IS

01:30:44.972 --> 01:30:46.874
FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT THAN A

01:30:46.941 --> 01:30:49.677
DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT MIGHT BE IN A

01:30:49.744 --> 01:30:50.511
CONTRACT DISPUTE.

01:30:50.578 --> 01:30:52.413
YOUR HONOR PERCENT CORRECT.

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:54.782
THAT'S THESE ARE CHILDREN IS OUR

01:30:54.849 --> 01:30:56.217
FAMILIES.

01:30:56.284 --> 01:30:58.219
WE WILL WE HAVE WE HAVE ALL I I

01:30:58.286 --> 01:30:59.120
ACTUALLY DID SOME FAMILY LAW TO

01:30:59.187 --> 01:31:00.321
SO YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE IN

01:31:00.388 --> 01:31:01.522
THE ROOM WHOSE PRACTICE FAMILY

01:31:01.589 --> 01:31:01.989
LAW.

01:31:02.056 --> 01:31:04.025
AND AND PERHAPS SOME OF MY

01:31:04.091 --> 01:31:05.560
COLLEAGUES WHO HAD THE

01:31:05.626 --> 01:31:08.296
MISFORTUNE OF DOING IT AS WELL --

01:31:08.362 --> 01:31:10.598
BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

01:31:10.665 --> 01:31:11.766
DIFFERENT PROVISIONS YOU CAN

01:31:11.833 --> 01:31:13.801
STIPULATE TO HAVE A REPORT GOING

01:31:13.868 --> 01:31:16.637
TO THE RECORD -- THERE ARE THERE

01:31:16.704 --> 01:31:19.006
ARE TREMENDOUS PROTECTIONS THIS

01:31:19.073 --> 01:31:21.042
IS AN ISSUE ABOUT HEARSAY.

01:31:21.108 --> 01:31:22.643
HOW FAR YOU GONNA LET HERE SAY

01:31:22.710 --> 01:31:24.846
IN AS THE BASIS UPON WHICH AN

01:31:24.912 --> 01:31:27.648
EXPERT MAKES AN OPINION WITHOUT

01:31:27.715 --> 01:31:30.284
ANY ABILITY TO VALIDATE THAT

01:31:30.351 --> 01:31:30.985
HERE SAY?

01:31:31.052 --> 01:31:32.787
THAT'S WHAT THERE ARE THIS BILL

01:31:32.854 --> 01:31:36.490
LAST FOUR SOUGHT LET'S BE CLEAR

01:31:36.557 --> 01:31:39.527
WITH THE BILL LAST.

01:31:39.594 --> 01:31:41.229
FOR OUR IF -- IT WAS THE OTHER

01:31:41.295 --> 01:31:44.198
QUESTION.

01:31:44.265 --> 01:31:45.366
ANY NO I THINK I'LL COME BACK

01:31:45.433 --> 01:31:47.134
PLEASE GO AHEAD.

01:31:47.201 --> 01:31:48.836
ALL RIGHT -- ARE THERE ANY OTHER

01:31:48.903 --> 01:31:51.305
QUESTIONS IDEA.

01:31:51.372 --> 01:31:53.074
I FIND IT NOTABLE THAT THE

01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:55.076
COURTS THE JUDGES ARE OPPOSED TO

01:31:55.142 --> 01:31:55.910
THIS.

01:31:55.977 --> 01:31:58.312
I FIND IT NOTABLE THE FLEX COM

01:31:58.379 --> 01:32:00.014
IS IN SUPPORTING THIS BILL -- I

01:32:00.081 --> 01:32:03.551
ALSO FIND IT NOTABLE THAT 85290%

01:32:03.618 --> 01:32:05.553
OF LITIGANTS ARE SELF.

01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:07.788
OF IS REPRESENTING THEY'RE NOT

01:32:07.855 --> 01:32:09.357
GOING TO KNOW ABOUT THESE

01:32:09.423 --> 01:32:11.359
DIFFERENT KINDS OF NUANCES AND I

01:32:11.425 --> 01:32:14.161
WOULD SUSPECT.

01:32:14.228 --> 01:32:15.763
THAT THIS IS -- TO TO TO PASS

01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:16.998
THIS LEGISLATION WILL BE A

01:32:17.064 --> 01:32:19.300
BOONDOGGLE FOR THOSE WHO ARE

01:32:19.367 --> 01:32:21.502
ABLE TO CONTINUE.

01:32:21.569 --> 01:32:23.404
THE PROCESS IN A OF PROVIDE FOR

01:32:23.471 --> 01:32:25.706
ADDITIONAL HEARINGS TO BRING IN

01:32:25.773 --> 01:32:27.742
THIS WITNESS OR OR NOT BRING IN

01:32:27.808 --> 01:32:28.242
THAT WHEN THIS.

01:32:28.309 --> 01:32:30.444
THERE'S THERE'S A REASON THAT

01:32:30.511 --> 01:32:30.945
HEARSAY.

01:32:31.012 --> 01:32:33.981
OF HAS CERTAIN LIMITATIONS TO IT.

01:32:34.048 --> 01:32:36.617
AND WHAT THIS BILL IN MY OPINION

01:32:36.684 --> 01:32:38.452
DOES HIS ATTEMPTS TO BASICALLY

01:32:38.519 --> 01:32:40.288
BLOW THAT A PART.

01:32:40.354 --> 01:32:42.523
OF AND ON THE BASIS THAT THIS IS

01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:45.559
GOING TO BE MORE PROTECTIVE OF

01:32:45.626 --> 01:32:47.295
CHILDREN WHICH I DON'T THINK IT

01:32:47.361 --> 01:32:48.462
IS BECAUSE AGAIN YOU LET YOUR

01:32:48.529 --> 01:32:49.163
ALLOWING.

01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:51.799
SOMEONE TO MAKE ALLEGATIONS AND

01:32:51.866 --> 01:32:53.734
STATEMENTS THAT HAVE.

01:32:53.801 --> 01:32:54.802
THAT ARE HEARSAY I MEAN THAT ARE

01:32:54.869 --> 01:32:56.003
OUT OF COURT STATEMENTS THAT ARE

01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:57.838
BEING OFFERED FOR THE TRUTH OF

01:32:57.905 --> 01:32:59.473
THE MATTER ASSERTED -- THAT FORM

01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:01.509
THE BASIS FOR REPORTS FORM THE

01:33:01.575 --> 01:33:04.078
BASIS PERHAPS FOR EVEN AN EXPERT

01:33:04.145 --> 01:33:05.413
DECIDING WHAT PROPERTY IS

01:33:05.479 --> 01:33:07.081
COMMUNITY PROPERTY AND WHAT

01:33:07.148 --> 01:33:08.516
PROPERTY IS SEPARATE PROPERTY.

01:33:08.582 --> 01:33:09.884
THESE ARE SO THEY'RE NOT

01:33:09.951 --> 01:33:11.819
NECESSARILY CHILD BASED IF YOU

01:33:11.886 --> 01:33:13.521
WILL THESE THESE OF FAMILY LAW

01:33:13.587 --> 01:33:15.523
CASES WHERE A NUMBER OF ISSUES.

01:33:15.589 --> 01:33:18.426
ARE. O BE DECIDED I JUST DON'T

01:33:18.492 --> 01:33:19.727
UNDERSTAND WHY WE SHULD.

01:33:19.794 --> 01:33:21.329
TAKE AWAY THE PROTECTIONS THAT

01:33:21.395 --> 01:33:24.065
WE HAVE UNDER THE EVIDENCE CODE --

01:33:24.131 --> 01:33:25.933
IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE AND I WOULD

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.501
SUGGEST THAT THE FACT THAT WE

01:33:27.568 --> 01:33:29.537
DON'T HAVE THE FAMILY LAW BAR

01:33:29.603 --> 01:33:31.973
ITSELF COMING IN THAT WE HAVE

01:33:32.039 --> 01:33:33.541
OBJECTION FROM THE COURTS.

01:33:33.607 --> 01:33:36.110
AND JUDICIAL COUNCIL REALLY IS A

01:33:36.177 --> 01:33:38.946
STRONG STATEMENT END -- THAT --

01:33:39.013 --> 01:33:40.715
THAT THIS REALLY IS AN OVER

01:33:40.781 --> 01:33:42.550
REACH AND I THINK.

01:33:42.616 --> 01:33:44.118
VIOLATES IGNORE RULES OF

01:33:44.185 --> 01:33:44.952
EVIDENCE SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN

01:33:45.019 --> 01:33:47.221
PLACE FOR A LONG TIME AND FOR

01:33:47.288 --> 01:33:49.690
GOOD REASON RIGHT SO -- MAYBE

01:33:49.757 --> 01:33:52.994
CREATE AN EXAMPLE DOES TO FLESH

01:33:53.060 --> 01:33:54.428
THIS OUT.

01:33:54.495 --> 01:33:56.197
SO IMAGINE AN EXPERT WITNESS.

01:33:56.263 --> 01:33:57.865
RELIES UPON THE SCHOOL

01:33:57.932 --> 01:33:58.933
COUNSELORS.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.801
A HEARSAY STATEMENT.

01:34:00.868 --> 01:34:02.870
AND THAT THAT EXPERT WITNESS IS

01:34:02.937 --> 01:34:04.605
FORMING AN OPINION IN A CUSTODY

01:34:04.672 --> 01:34:05.940
MATTER.

01:34:06.007 --> 01:34:07.375
YOU'RE SAYING THAT THAT THAT

01:34:07.441 --> 01:34:09.076
EXPERT WITNESS SHOULD HAVE THE

01:34:09.143 --> 01:34:11.545
ABILITY TO FORM THEIR EXPERT

01:34:11.612 --> 01:34:13.981
OPINION UPON THE HEARSAY

01:34:14.048 --> 01:34:16.584
STATEMENT OF THAT COUNSELOR. TO

01:34:16.650 --> 01:34:18.352
REDUCE THE COSTS IN ALLOW THAT

01:34:18.419 --> 01:34:20.755
IF IT'S USED AS UNDERLYING

01:34:20.821 --> 01:34:22.423
JUSTIFICATION FOR THAT EXPERTS

01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:25.059
OPINION. TO BRING THAT INTO THE

01:34:25.126 --> 01:34:26.794
COURT SYSTEM.

01:34:26.861 --> 01:34:29.463
AND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT.

01:34:29.530 --> 01:34:31.632
NORMAL HERE SAY WOULD REQUIRE

01:34:31.699 --> 01:34:32.900
THAT THAT EXPERT WHAT THAT THAT

01:34:32.967 --> 01:34:34.735
COUNSELOR BE BROUGHT IN TO

01:34:34.802 --> 01:34:37.138
SUBSTANTIATE WHAT THEY SAID THAT

01:34:37.204 --> 01:34:39.640
WAS THAT WAS HEARD BY THE EXPERT

01:34:39.707 --> 01:34:42.376
WITNESS [inaudible]

01:34:42.443 --> 01:34:44.912
IN.

01:34:44.979 --> 01:34:46.347
AND THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF

01:34:46.414 --> 01:34:47.448
INFORMATION.

01:34:47.515 --> 01:34:49.250
SO YOU'RE YOU'RE ACCURATE IN

01:34:49.316 --> 01:34:51.318
YOUR STATEMENT THAT THAT IS ONE

01:34:51.385 --> 01:34:52.486
OF THE FACTORS THAT THE CUSTODY

01:34:52.553 --> 01:34:54.822
EVALUATOR COULD DO WITH THAT IS.

01:34:54.889 --> 01:34:57.625
THE CUSTODY EVALUATORS JOB AS A

01:34:57.691 --> 01:34:58.993
COURT APPOINTED HAVE EXPERT

01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:00.528
UNDER THE FAMILY CODE I THINK

01:35:00.594 --> 01:35:01.796
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT

01:35:01.862 --> 01:35:03.664
FAMILY CALLED THIRTY ONE ELEVEN

01:35:03.731 --> 01:35:06.267
IS A LEGISLATIVELY MANDATED CODE.

01:35:06.333 --> 01:35:08.569
THAT AUTHORIZES THE APPOINTMENT

01:35:08.636 --> 01:35:11.072
OF CHILD CUSTODY EVALUATORS TO

01:35:11.138 --> 01:35:12.873
DO THIS EXACT THING AND TO

01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:16.043
PROVIDE REPORTS TO THE COURT.

01:35:16.110 --> 01:35:17.945
AND NOW WITH THE SANCHEZ THEY'RE

01:35:18.012 --> 01:35:19.947
SAYING WELL WAIT A MINUTE THE

01:35:20.014 --> 01:35:22.049
LEGISLATING FROM THE MANDATE A

01:35:22.116 --> 01:35:23.451
CUSTODY EVALUATOR.

01:35:23.517 --> 01:35:25.219
WHO IS SUPPOSED TO CONTACT ALL

01:35:25.286 --> 01:35:27.021
THESE COLLATERAL RESOURCES FOR

01:35:27.088 --> 01:35:29.156
THE COURT NOW HIS OR HER REPORT

01:35:29.223 --> 01:35:31.792
CAN'T COME INTO EVIDENCE -- SO

01:35:31.859 --> 01:35:32.526
YOUR STATEMENT IS CORRECT THAT

01:35:32.593 --> 01:35:33.928
THAT WOULD BE IF IT WAS A SCHOOL

01:35:33.994 --> 01:35:36.163
COUNSELOR THAT WOULD BE ONE OF

01:35:36.230 --> 01:35:37.765
THE PERSONS THAT THE CUSTODY

01:35:37.832 --> 01:35:38.999
EVALUATOR MAY TALK.

01:35:39.066 --> 01:35:40.401
TO AND INFORMING HIS OR HER

01:35:40.468 --> 01:35:42.103
OPINION TO THE COURT AS TO WHAT

01:35:42.169 --> 01:35:43.671
THAT PERSON BELIEVES IS IN THE

01:35:43.737 --> 01:35:46.340
BEST INTEREST FOR THE CHILD.

01:35:46.407 --> 01:35:49.610
THAT AND IN PREVIOUS AS I STATED

01:35:49.677 --> 01:35:51.045
IF THE OTHER PARENT BELIEVES

01:35:51.112 --> 01:35:52.146
THAT THAT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY WITH

01:35:52.213 --> 01:35:54.014
RIDE UPON THEY CAN TELL THE

01:35:54.081 --> 01:35:56.283
OTHER PARENT YOU NEED TO PRODUCE.

01:35:56.350 --> 01:35:59.487
THAT SCHOOL COUNSELOR FOR ME TO

01:35:59.553 --> 01:36:00.754
CROSS EXAMINE IT.

01:36:00.821 --> 01:36:02.790
IT DOESN'T STOP THE ABILITY TO

01:36:02.857 --> 01:36:04.258
CROSS EXAMINE THAT WITNESS AT

01:36:04.325 --> 01:36:06.660
ALL.

01:36:06.727 --> 01:36:08.896
SO THE LAW THEY MEET MAYBE GIVEN

01:36:08.963 --> 01:36:10.931
OTHER IF I EXCUSE ME IF I COULD

01:36:10.998 --> 01:36:12.633
JUST SOLD CLARIFY THIS.

01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:14.368
SO AN EXPERT IS ENTITLED TO MAKE

01:36:14.435 --> 01:36:16.370
BASIC OF A TO FORM BASIC

01:36:16.437 --> 01:36:18.973
OPINIONS AND TO ARTICULATE I

01:36:19.039 --> 01:36:20.407
SPOKE TO SEVERAL DIFFERENT

01:36:20.474 --> 01:36:23.544
PEOPLE BASED UPON THAT.

01:36:23.611 --> 01:36:26.347
ARE MY GENERAL OPINION IS X. Y.

01:36:26.413 --> 01:36:27.648
AND SEE THEY DO HAVE THE ABILITY

01:36:27.715 --> 01:36:28.082
TO DO THAT.

01:36:28.149 --> 01:36:29.350
BUT IF THEY'RE TAKING THE

01:36:29.416 --> 01:36:34.755
OPINION OF ONE PERSON AS FACT.

01:36:34.822 --> 01:36:35.756
AND I AM RELYING UPON THAT

01:36:35.823 --> 01:36:37.825
DECISION AS FACT.

01:36:37.892 --> 01:36:41.262
THERE IS THAT THERE IS.

01:36:41.328 --> 01:36:42.763
THERE IS A HEARSAY OPINION THAT

01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:45.199
IS BEING USED AS A BASIS UPON

01:36:45.266 --> 01:36:46.367
IT'S NOT HYPOTHETICAL WE ARE

01:36:46.433 --> 01:36:48.235
OFTEN TALKING HYPOTHETICALS

01:36:48.302 --> 01:36:50.538
WHICH WERE ALLOWED.

01:36:50.604 --> 01:36:51.939
USUALLY TO USE TO GET YOU KNOW

01:36:52.006 --> 01:36:54.208
EXPERT THE CENTER CUBBY YEAR OLD

01:36:54.275 --> 01:36:56.443
ASSUME THE FOLLOWING FACTS.

01:36:56.510 --> 01:36:58.145
AND THEN YOU REGION OPINION BUT

01:36:58.212 --> 01:37:02.950
TO SAY I KNOW THAT MISTER SMITH --

01:37:03.017 --> 01:37:04.718
A HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THE

01:37:04.785 --> 01:37:07.855
TRIAL TO SAID I HATE MY MOTHER.

01:37:07.922 --> 01:37:08.989
AS SOON AS SO TAKE THAT IS A

01:37:09.056 --> 01:37:10.891
FACT DO YOU THINK THAT CHILD

01:37:10.958 --> 01:37:12.426
SHOULD HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE

01:37:12.493 --> 01:37:14.695
MOTHER THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE

01:37:14.762 --> 01:37:15.863
KIND OF THING WHERE THIS WOULD

01:37:15.930 --> 01:37:16.230
HAPPEN.

01:37:16.297 --> 01:37:18.632
SO YOU TAKE THIS EXTRAORDINARY

01:37:18.699 --> 01:37:19.567
HERE SAY.

01:37:19.633 --> 01:37:21.402
IT BECOMES A BASIS FOR THE

01:37:21.468 --> 01:37:23.404
OPINION THAT THAT IS PROVIDED TO

01:37:23.470 --> 01:37:24.605
THE COURT IN FROM WHICH YOU'RE

01:37:24.672 --> 01:37:26.574
ASKING THE COURT. TO MAKE A

01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:28.542
FINDING THAT THAT CHILD SHOULD

01:37:28.609 --> 01:37:31.512
LIVE WITH THE MOTHER.

01:37:31.579 --> 01:37:32.613
IT WOULD STILL BE SUBJECT TO

01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:33.447
CROSS EXAMINATION [inaudible]

01:37:33.514 --> 01:37:34.014
THAT INDIVIDUAL [inaudible]

01:37:34.081 --> 01:37:36.016
WELL.

01:37:36.083 --> 01:37:37.551
THANK YOU YOU COULD ALWAYS BRING

01:37:37.618 --> 01:37:39.787
THAT THE PERSON IN BUT AGAIN

01:37:39.853 --> 01:37:41.655
PART OF THE PROBLEM IS NOW YOU

01:37:41.722 --> 01:37:43.724
HAVE TO BRING THAT PERSON IN.

01:37:43.791 --> 01:37:49.763
SO THAT IS -- THAT'S THE POINT

01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:50.998
WHEN NO NO NO BUT BUT YOU'RE

01:37:51.065 --> 01:37:52.533
WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU ARE

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:54.935
TRYING TO USE.

01:37:55.002 --> 01:37:57.037
HERE SAY AS FACT THAT'S THE

01:37:57.104 --> 01:37:58.439
PROBLEM.

01:37:58.505 --> 01:37:59.707
YOU'RE TRYING TO USE HERE SAY IS

01:37:59.773 --> 01:38:00.975
FACT AND THERE'S A REASON THAT

01:38:01.041 --> 01:38:03.944
WE HAVE HAD THESE HERE SAY LAWS

01:38:04.011 --> 01:38:05.379
BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT FACT.

01:38:05.446 --> 01:38:06.347
THEY ARE NOT IN AND OF

01:38:06.413 --> 01:38:08.949
THEMSELVES UNLESS YOU YOU HAVE

01:38:09.016 --> 01:38:11.885
THAT THAT HEARSAY EXCEPTION THAT

01:38:11.952 --> 01:38:13.387
EXISTS BUT IT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING

01:38:13.454 --> 01:38:14.989
TO WAS EXPAND THAT EXCEPTION

01:38:15.055 --> 01:38:16.757
HERE AND I THINK THAT THAT'S WHY

01:38:16.824 --> 01:38:18.058
THE COURTS ARE.

01:38:18.125 --> 01:38:20.928
OPPOSED TO THE SHE CAN'T DO THIS

01:38:20.995 --> 01:38:22.563
AND ANY OTHER CIVIL PROCEEDING.

01:38:22.630 --> 01:38:23.731
AND THE THIRD AND THE COURTS

01:38:23.797 --> 01:38:25.532
AGAIN INDICATE THEY WANT TO HAVE

01:38:25.599 --> 01:38:28.168
THAT RELIABILITY -- SO THAT WE

01:38:28.235 --> 01:38:30.337
CAN WE STILL HAVE THE RULES OF

01:38:30.404 --> 01:38:33.073
EVIDENCE RATHER THAN SUSPENDING

01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:34.008
THE RULES OF EVIDENCE THIRD

01:38:34.074 --> 01:38:34.742
THIRD THERE DOESN'T SEEM I

01:38:34.808 --> 01:38:36.777
HAVEN'T FOUND ANY GOOD REASON TO

01:38:36.844 --> 01:38:39.346
SUSPEND THOSE RULES OF EVIDENCE.

01:38:39.413 --> 01:38:40.748
IN THIS KIND OF PROCEEDING SMALL

01:38:40.814 --> 01:38:41.982
CLAIMS COURT.

01:38:42.049 --> 01:38:43.817
THE RULES OF EVIDENCE DON'T

01:38:43.884 --> 01:38:44.652
EXIST.

01:38:44.718 --> 01:38:45.753
THERE'S A COURT OF EQUITY NOT A

01:38:45.819 --> 01:38:46.820
COURT OF LAW.

01:38:46.887 --> 01:38:48.789
ARE YOU TRYING TO ALMOST

01:38:48.856 --> 01:38:51.325
TRANSFORM THE FAMILY.

01:38:51.392 --> 01:38:53.093
ENVIRONMENT [inaudible]

01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:54.628
INTO.

01:38:54.695 --> 01:38:57.931
A HYBRID COURT OF EQUITY NOT

01:38:57.998 --> 01:38:59.266
JUST COURT OF LAW.

01:38:59.333 --> 01:39:00.267
NO IT'S A QUITE A LOT BUT I WILL

01:39:00.334 --> 01:39:01.468
SAY THAT FAMILIES ACCORD EQUITY

01:39:01.535 --> 01:39:06.273
IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN IT'S BUT IT'S

01:39:06.340 --> 01:39:08.008
THERE THERE ISN'T THIS CASE

01:39:08.075 --> 01:39:09.109
SPECIFIC HEARSAY ISN'T

01:39:09.176 --> 01:39:10.644
NECESSARILY THE FAX ADMISSIBLE

01:39:10.711 --> 01:39:12.379
IT IS THE REPORT THAT IS

01:39:12.446 --> 01:39:14.848
ADMITTED INTO EVIDENCE I THINK

01:39:14.915 --> 01:39:15.883
THAT'S A BIG DISTINCTION.

01:39:15.949 --> 01:39:19.153
THE REPORT OF THE CUSTODY

01:39:19.219 --> 01:39:22.856
EVALUATOR OR THE C. C. R. C.

01:39:22.923 --> 01:39:25.759
THAT'S THE ON THE COURT SERVICES --

01:39:25.826 --> 01:39:26.660
YOU KNOW -- RECOMMENDING

01:39:26.727 --> 01:39:28.095
COUNSELORS THE REPORT IS

01:39:28.162 --> 01:39:30.331
ADMITTED INTO EVIDENCE TO BE

01:39:30.397 --> 01:39:31.332
CONSIDERED.

01:39:31.398 --> 01:39:34.635
THE IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN

01:39:34.702 --> 01:39:36.904
ALL OF THE INDIVIDUAL FACTS IT

01:39:36.970 --> 01:39:38.272
IS THE FOR WHAT HAPPENS IN THE

01:39:38.339 --> 01:39:39.440
AND INTO OVER ALMOST TWENTY FIVE

01:39:39.506 --> 01:39:40.741
YEARS OF PRACTICE I HAVE NEVER

01:39:40.808 --> 01:39:41.809
SEEN.

01:39:41.875 --> 01:39:44.078
A CUSTODY EVALUATION THAT

01:39:44.144 --> 01:39:46.046
RECOMMENDS A CUSTODY AND

01:39:46.113 --> 01:39:48.415
VISITATION TO PARENTS BASED ON

01:39:48.482 --> 01:39:49.516
ONE PERSON THESE REPORTS ARE

01:39:49.583 --> 01:39:51.752
USUALLY ABOUT FIFTY TO SIXTY

01:39:51.819 --> 01:39:54.188
PAGES LONG.

01:39:54.254 --> 01:39:57.725
AND THEY'VE TAUGHT TO A NUMBER

01:39:57.791 --> 01:40:01.662
OF DIFFERENT -- PEOPLE AND THE

01:40:01.729 --> 01:40:02.896
AND AND AGAIN A WEEK WE HAVE A

01:40:02.963 --> 01:40:04.665
RESPONSE PERHAPS FROM THOSE IN

01:40:04.732 --> 01:40:06.033
OPPOSITION WERE SHAKING THEIR

01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:06.633
HEADS IF YOU'D LIKE TO RESPOND

01:40:06.700 --> 01:40:08.469
TO THAT [inaudible]

01:40:08.535 --> 01:40:12.172
WELL ON AND THE LIMóN BOMB FOR

01:40:12.239 --> 01:40:12.673
JUDICIAL COUNCIL I THINK

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:14.608
PROCEDURALLY ON THE ONE HAND

01:40:14.675 --> 01:40:15.576
WE'VE.

01:40:15.642 --> 01:40:19.346
STATED THAT THE VAST THE THE THE

01:40:19.413 --> 01:40:20.481
PROPOSED.

01:40:20.547 --> 01:40:24.451
LAW THE PROPOSED OF BILL WOULD

01:40:24.518 --> 01:40:27.354
BENEFIT -- A PARTY THAT HAS

01:40:27.421 --> 01:40:30.257
GREATER MEANS IN A FAMILY LAW

01:40:30.324 --> 01:40:31.191
CASE.

01:40:31.258 --> 01:40:32.393
AND AT THE SAME TIME WE'VE SAID

01:40:32.459 --> 01:40:34.027
THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF

01:40:34.094 --> 01:40:35.295
LITIGANTS IN FAMILY LAW DON'T

01:40:35.362 --> 01:40:37.831
HAVE ACCESS TO ANY OF THIS.

01:40:37.898 --> 01:40:40.100
BUT TO PUT A FINER POINT ON IT.

01:40:40.167 --> 01:40:42.569
IF ONE PARTY IS REPRESENTED IN

01:40:42.636 --> 01:40:44.471
THE OTHER ISN'T TO ANNA REPORT

01:40:44.538 --> 01:40:49.143
IS ADMISSIBLE UNDER THE TERMS OF

01:40:49.209 --> 01:40:50.377
FOUR THIRTY FIVE THEN AND NOT

01:40:50.444 --> 01:40:52.646
REPORT THEN IT IS CONSIDERED

01:40:52.713 --> 01:40:54.648
VALID SO IT'S BASICALLY TAKING A

01:40:54.715 --> 01:40:57.050
THIRD THIRD PARTY STATEMENTS AND

01:40:57.117 --> 01:40:58.685
GIVING THEM THE IN PREMATURE OF

01:40:58.752 --> 01:40:59.987
VALIDITY.

01:41:00.053 --> 01:41:01.588
BY PUTTING THEM IN A REPORT THAT

01:41:01.655 --> 01:41:03.390
DENNIS ADMISSIBLE AS HEARSAY

01:41:03.457 --> 01:41:04.625
EVIDENCE.

01:41:04.691 --> 01:41:06.326
BUT THE OTHER PARTY DOESN'T HAVE

01:41:06.393 --> 01:41:08.162
THE ABILITY TO SUBMIT A REPORT

01:41:08.228 --> 01:41:10.297
THEY HAVE TO BRING IN THEIR OWN

01:41:10.364 --> 01:41:12.466
WITNESSES YOU HAVE A HUGE

01:41:12.533 --> 01:41:14.701
STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE THAT I

01:41:14.768 --> 01:41:16.570
THINK ALREADY EXISTS.

01:41:16.637 --> 01:41:18.405
AND I DON'T THINK THE S. BEFORE

01:41:18.472 --> 01:41:19.273
THIRTY FIVE ADDRESSES THAT

01:41:19.339 --> 01:41:21.108
STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE AND FAX

01:41:21.175 --> 01:41:23.944
MAKES MORE WORK FOR THE COURTS.

01:41:24.011 --> 01:41:25.712
IN TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:41:25.779 --> 01:41:26.980
THERE IS EQUITY AND THAT THERE

01:41:27.047 --> 01:41:29.550
IS AN APPEARANCE THAT ALL

01:41:29.616 --> 01:41:32.486
PARTIES AND ALL NEEDS ARE BEING

01:41:32.553 --> 01:41:34.788
TAKEN CARE OF AND I WOULD LIKE

01:41:34.855 --> 01:41:36.523
IN RESPONSE.

01:41:36.590 --> 01:41:37.791
THE SUPREME COURT IS HAS ALSO

01:41:37.858 --> 01:41:39.593
STATED THAT THE SAME JUDICIAL

01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:41.195
RESOURCES AND SAFEGUARDS SHOULD

01:41:41.261 --> 01:41:42.896
BE COMMITTED TO A FAMILY LAW

01:41:42.963 --> 01:41:44.865
TRIAL AS ARE COMMITTED TO OTHER

01:41:44.932 --> 01:41:46.166

01:41:50.637 --> 01:41:52.673
CLAIMS ISSUE BUT A FAMILY ARE

01:41:52.739 --> 01:41:54.107

01:41:59.246 --> 01:42:02.049
LITIGANTS APPLY AND THE COURTS

01:42:02.115 --> 01:42:03.917
TO SHOULD APPLY AS THEY DO IN

01:42:03.984 --> 01:42:05.219
OTHER CIVIL MATTERS SO.

01:42:05.285 --> 01:42:06.820

IN ONE CASE HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:42:32.846 --> 01:42:34.548
PAGES OF BANK STATEMENTS BROADEN

COSTS I WOULD SAY THAT FENCE HAS

01:42:48.662 --> 01:42:50.264
BEEN VERY EXPENSIVE.

01:42:50.330 --> 01:42:52.332
THE FAMILY LAW AND IN IN SOME

01:42:52.399 --> 01:42:54.201
CASES HAS ACTUALLY BEEN

01:42:54.268 --> 01:42:55.235
ACRIMONIOUS IS LIKE I'M GONNA

01:42:55.302 --> 01:42:56.937
STICK IT TO THE HUSBAND BECAUSE

FORCE HIM UNDER SANCHEZ TO

01:42:59.973 --> 01:43:01.108
PROVIDE ALL KINDS OF DOCUMENTS

01:43:01.174 --> 01:43:02.576
AND THAT WAS SORT OF THE GENESIS

01:43:02.643 --> 01:43:06.346
OF A OF THIS BILL -- I'D FAMILY

01:43:06.413 --> 01:43:07.414
LAW ATTORNEY COME IN SAID BOY

01:43:07.481 --> 01:43:09.983
THIS IS JUST GETTING ABUSED SO I

01:43:10.050 --> 01:43:11.318
APPRECIATE THE CHAIRMAN'S

01:43:11.385 --> 01:43:12.719
COMMENT ABOUT HOW DIFFICULT

01:43:12.786 --> 01:43:15.055
FAMILY LAW IS.

01:43:15.122 --> 01:43:16.456
I GOT OUT OF IT AFTER AWHILE I

01:43:16.523 --> 01:43:17.891
SERVED AS AN EXPERT WITNESS IN

01:43:17.958 --> 01:43:20.294
IN DIVORCE CASES IN IT IS NOT A

01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:23.130
PRETTY AREA TO WORK AND I I I

01:43:23.196 --> 01:43:24.398
JUST BY AND HE SAID THIS IS NOT

01:43:24.464 --> 01:43:25.132
WHERE I WANT.

01:43:25.198 --> 01:43:26.867
TO FOCUS TIME WITH REGARDS TO

01:43:26.934 --> 01:43:28.802
FLEX COM THEY WERE SUPPORTIVE

01:43:28.869 --> 01:43:29.570
THEY WENT NEUTRAL IT'S MY

01:43:29.636 --> 01:43:30.437
UNDERSTANDING.

01:43:30.504 --> 01:43:32.139
AND NOT ALL JUDGES ARE OPPOSE

01:43:32.205 --> 01:43:32.806
BECAUSE I WORK WITH JUDGES THIS

01:43:32.873 --> 01:43:35.742
WHOLE FALL AND WINTER TO HAVE TO

01:43:35.809 --> 01:43:41.815
TO PUT THIS BILL AT TOGETHER.

01:43:41.882 --> 01:43:43.417
SO I I'M PAUL I'M HEARING OUT OF

01:43:43.483 --> 01:43:44.151
THAT TESTIMONY FROM THE

01:43:44.217 --> 01:43:45.752
OPPONENTS IS THERE'S NO REASON

01:43:45.819 --> 01:43:46.653
TO TREAT FAMILY A LOT DIFFERENT

01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:47.554
THAN ANY OTHER.

01:43:47.621 --> 01:43:48.322
COURT ROOM AND I I'M MAKING THE

01:43:48.388 --> 01:43:49.489
ARGUMENT THAT IT IS THAT WE HAVE

01:43:49.556 --> 01:43:51.925
THE ABILITY TO MAKE FAMILY LAW --

01:43:51.992 --> 01:43:53.260
COURTS OF MORE FAIR MORE

01:43:53.327 --> 01:43:55.862
EFFICIENT AND LESS EXPENSIVE AND

BUT COMPARED TO OTHER PLACES IN

02:10:59.651 --> 02:11:01.687
IN THE COUNTRY AND CERTAINLY

02:11:01.753 --> 02:11:02.988
OTHER PLACES IN THE WORLD.

02:11:03.055 --> 02:11:04.156

ALWAYS VINDICATED.

02:11:13.332 --> 02:11:13.999
ABSOLUTELY NOT AND I'VE AND I

02:11:14.066 --> 02:11:15.334
KNOW SOME PRETTY BAD IS

02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:17.102
LANDLORDS.

02:11:17.169 --> 02:11:18.570
WHERE I COME FROM AN FRESNO WE

02:11:18.637 --> 02:11:21.173
HAD TO LITERALLY CREATE -- NEW

02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:24.042
POLICIES TO DEAL WITH SLUMLORDS

SO THEY'RE OUT THERE I KNOW THAT.

02:11:26.311 --> 02:11:27.613
BUT THE ISSUE IS NOT WHETHER NOT

THEIR BAD LANDLORDS OUT THERE

02:11:30.582 --> 02:11:31.984
IT'S WHETHER NOT TENANT RIGHTS

02:11:32.050 --> 02:11:35.887
ARE SO INFERIOR RIGHT NOW AS TO

02:11:35.954 --> 02:11:37.322

OF OF OF THE TENANTS.

02:11:43.362 --> 02:11:45.497
IN MY CONCERN IS AS WAS

02:11:45.564 --> 02:11:47.432
DESCRIBED BEFORE IS THAT WHEN

02:11:47.499 --> 02:11:50.335
YOU CREATE BARGAINING POWER.

02:11:50.402 --> 02:11:52.671
AND EVERY CHANGE IN

02:11:52.738 --> 02:11:55.407
CIRCUMSTANCES IN IN AESTHETICS

02:11:55.474 --> 02:11:57.142
OR LIVING CONDITIONS IT'S GOING

02:11:57.209 --> 02:11:58.644
TO REQUIRE A MEET AND CONFER

02:11:58.710 --> 02:12:00.045
OBLIGATION WHICH IS REALLY WHERE

02:12:00.112 --> 02:12:01.480
THIS IS GOING BUT ULTIMATELY

02:12:01.546 --> 02:12:03.248
GOING. TO A COLLECTIVE

COMPLETELY.

02:12:09.788 --> 02:12:11.957
CHANGING THE WHOLE NOTION OF

RENT AND IN OUR SYSTEM I THAT'S

02:12:19.765 --> 02:12:21.800
NOT THE WAY THE THAT'S NOT THE

02:12:21.867 --> 02:12:23.969
WAY AMERICA WORKS.

02:12:24.036 --> 02:12:25.070

02:12:25.137 --> 02:12:27.306
WHEN IT COMES -- TO THE ABILITY

02:12:27.372 --> 02:12:29.641

YOU HAVE SECTION.

02:12:32.411 --> 02:12:34.279
EIGHT IF YOU HAVE A UNION.

02:12:34.346 --> 02:12:35.414
NOW ARE WE GOING TO BE IN A

02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:37.816
SITUATION WHERE EVEN SECTION.

02:12:37.883 --> 02:12:38.984
EIGHT IS GOING TO HAVE TO MEET

02:12:39.051 --> 02:12:40.452
AND CONFER WITH THE ASSOCIATION

02:12:40.519 --> 02:12:43.221
TO DETERMINE THE SUITABLE RENT

02:12:43.288 --> 02:12:44.923
FOR A GIVEN COMPLEX.

02:12:44.990 --> 02:12:46.825
THIS IS OPENING THE DOOR THAT I

02:12:46.892 --> 02:12:48.760
BELIEVE IT IS GOING TO BE HIGHLY

02:12:48.827 --> 02:12:50.195
PROBLEMATIC FOR THE ENTIRE

02:12:50.262 --> 02:12:52.130
INDUSTRY WE TALK ABOUT HOUSING

02:12:52.197 --> 02:12:52.597
IS A PROBLEM.

02:12:52.664 --> 02:12:55.267
WAIT TILL THIS MATURES INTO ITS

02:12:55.334 --> 02:12:57.102
FULLEST FORCE.

02:12:57.169 --> 02:12:59.738
THANK YOU -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO

02:12:59.805 --> 02:13:02.841
RESPOND. TO THAT OR WE'LL LET

02:13:02.908 --> 02:13:03.909
YOU RESPOND AND THEN SENATOR

02:13:03.975 --> 02:13:05.610
MONNING HAD A QUESTION OR TWO

02:13:05.677 --> 02:13:06.878
THANK YOU AND OBVIOUSLY NUMBER

02:13:06.945 --> 02:13:08.814
POINTS REYES THERE AND THANK YOU

02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:09.781
FOR THE QUESTIONS AYE AYE BUT

02:13:09.848 --> 02:13:11.817
JUST HE AND I JUST WANTED IN

02:13:11.883 --> 02:13:13.285
PARTICULAR JUST THE FIRST POINT.

02:13:13.352 --> 02:13:15.754
AROUND WHETHER RETALIATION IS

02:13:15.821 --> 02:13:17.522
CURRENTLY ARE PROHIBITED IN

02:13:17.589 --> 02:13:19.224
CALIFORNIA LAW ON IT YOU GIVE A

02:13:19.291 --> 02:13:20.926
COUPLE EXAMPLES OF THINGS AND

02:13:20.992 --> 02:13:23.128
AND I AGREE THAT IN THEORY --

02:13:23.195 --> 02:13:24.863
RETALIATION BY LANDLORD AGAINST

02:13:24.930 --> 02:13:27.733
A TENANT -- IS CURRENTLY ILLEGAL

02:13:27.799 --> 02:13:30.035
IN CALIFORNIA -- THE PROBLEM IS

02:13:30.102 --> 02:13:31.837
ONE OF PRACTICE SO IT CURRENTLY

02:13:31.903 --> 02:13:35.207
CALIFORNIA LAW ALLOWS A LANDLORD

02:13:35.273 --> 02:13:37.042
TO EVICT WITHOUT STATING ANY

02:13:37.109 --> 02:13:38.977
REASON WHAT SO EVER FOR WHY THEY

02:13:39.044 --> 02:13:40.579
ARE EVICTING SO AS A PRACTICAL

02:13:40.645 --> 02:13:42.214
MATTER IN YOUR EXAMPLES.

02:13:42.280 --> 02:13:43.982
IF I AS A TEN ATTORNEY IF A

02:13:44.049 --> 02:13:46.184
TENANT COMES TO ME AND SAYS I AM

02:13:46.251 --> 02:13:48.153
BEING EVICTED BECAUSE I'M DOING

02:13:48.220 --> 02:13:50.355
AXE RIGHT AND I THINK IT'S

02:13:50.422 --> 02:13:53.058
RETALIATORY NO I MEAN THE FEWEST

02:13:53.125 --> 02:13:54.292
SENATORS INTHE STATE WILL BE

02:13:54.359 --> 02:13:55.761
ABLE TO TAKE THAT CASE.

02:13:55.827 --> 02:13:57.195
BECAUSE YOU CAN ONLY UP TO

02:13:57.262 --> 02:14:00.532
CREATE YOUR TO DEFEND THAT IN

02:14:00.599 --> 02:14:01.666
COURT.

02:14:01.733 --> 02:14:02.667
RIGHT AGAINST AN EVICTION IS THE

02:14:02.734 --> 02:14:03.935
ONLY WAY YOU CAN ASSERT THAT AND

02:14:04.002 --> 02:14:05.504
SO WHAT THIS DOES.

02:14:05.570 --> 02:14:07.105
IS ATION CHAIR RIGHT SO WHAT THE

02:14:07.172 --> 02:14:09.541
WHAT THIS DOES IS IT REQUIRES

02:14:09.608 --> 02:14:12.310
THAT LAMBERT TO STATE THE REASON

02:14:12.377 --> 02:14:13.612
FOR EVICTION WHEN THEY'RE

02:14:13.678 --> 02:14:15.247
EVICTING THAT TENANT ASSOCIATION

02:14:15.313 --> 02:14:16.648
MEMBER DOESN'T RESTRICT THE

02:14:16.715 --> 02:14:18.583
REASONS HE JUST SAYS THEY CAN'T

02:14:18.650 --> 02:14:19.050
DO.

02:14:19.117 --> 02:14:20.786
AN EVICTION WITHOUT STATING THE

02:14:20.852 --> 02:14:22.287
REASON AND THAT'S ABSOLUTELY

02:14:22.354 --> 02:14:24.389
ESSENTIAL TO PREVENT LANDLORDS

02:14:24.456 --> 02:14:26.758
FROM ENGAGING A RETALIATORY

02:14:26.825 --> 02:14:29.394
EVICTION THANK YOU.

02:14:29.461 --> 02:14:30.862
ALL RIGHT SENATOR MONNING.

02:14:30.929 --> 02:14:32.898
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR.

02:14:32.964 --> 02:14:34.332
I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION A

02:14:34.399 --> 02:14:36.468
COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR THE

02:14:36.535 --> 02:14:40.338
AUTHOR OR ME BEFORE YOUR WITNESS --

02:14:40.405 --> 02:14:42.140
IN YOUR EXPERIENCE -- DOES A

02:14:42.207 --> 02:14:44.042
SINGLE TENANT WHO MAY HAVE

02:14:44.109 --> 02:14:48.280
COMPLAINTS ABOUT HABITABILITY --

02:14:48.346 --> 02:14:51.416
ALWAYS KNOW THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS.

02:14:51.483 --> 02:14:53.118
WELL THEY DON'T KNOW THEIR LEGAL

02:14:53.185 --> 02:14:55.454
RIGHTS BUT WORSE IS THEY'RE

02:14:55.520 --> 02:14:58.957
AFRAID. TO EVEN RAISE THE ISSUES

02:14:59.024 --> 02:15:00.792
SO EVEN IF THEY KNOW OF THEIR

02:15:00.859 --> 02:15:01.393
LEGAL RIGHTS WITHIN A YEAR OF

02:15:01.460 --> 02:15:03.295
STEPPING FORWARD INDIVIDUALLY

02:15:03.361 --> 02:15:06.331
THERE'S A FEAR OF POSSIBLE.

02:15:06.398 --> 02:15:07.666
RETALIATION THAT.

02:15:07.732 --> 02:15:10.435
TRANSLATES TO EVICTION LOSING

02:15:10.502 --> 02:15:11.436
THEIR PLACE TO LIVE.

02:15:11.503 --> 02:15:12.404
IN YOUR EXPERIENCE TO ALL

02:15:12.471 --> 02:15:13.939
TENANTS.

02:15:14.005 --> 02:15:15.507
THE MANAGERS OF PROPERTIES ALL

02:15:15.574 --> 02:15:16.975
SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE AS THE

02:15:17.042 --> 02:15:19.811
TENANTS.

02:15:19.878 --> 02:15:22.314
THE YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET

02:15:22.380 --> 02:15:25.984
MORE PARTICULARS BUT LANGUAGES.

02:15:26.051 --> 02:15:28.220
ALWAYS A BARRIER.

02:15:28.286 --> 02:15:30.689
IN THE EXAMPLE OF THREE FORCE

02:15:30.755 --> 02:15:32.357
TENANTS SITTING AROUND THE

02:15:32.424 --> 02:15:33.525
KITCHEN TABLE IN [inaudible]

02:15:33.592 --> 02:15:35.794
PROVIDING.

02:15:35.861 --> 02:15:37.662
REINFORCEMENT TEACH OTHER A

02:15:37.729 --> 02:15:39.164
REVIEW OF WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE

02:15:39.231 --> 02:15:42.167
IN YOUR EXPERIENCE IS THAT --

02:15:42.234 --> 02:15:45.003
RAISE THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING

02:15:45.070 --> 02:15:47.339
ABLE TO ADVANCE A CONCERN --

02:15:47.405 --> 02:15:49.975
GRIEVANCE WITH MORE CONFIDENCE

02:15:50.041 --> 02:15:51.510
THAN AS AN INDIVIDUAL.

02:15:51.576 --> 02:15:54.913
ABSOLUTELY IT IT ENABLES FOLKS

02:15:54.980 --> 02:15:56.114
TO MOVE FORWARD AND STATE THEIR

02:15:56.181 --> 02:15:58.216
CONCERNS -- WITHOUT BEING

02:15:58.283 --> 02:16:01.553
TARGETED IN THE SAME WAY THEY

02:16:01.620 --> 02:16:02.120
WOULD BE IF THEY WERE ACTING

02:16:02.187 --> 02:16:03.088
ALONE.

02:16:03.154 --> 02:16:04.122
AND THEN I WANT SHIP THERE SOME

02:16:04.189 --> 02:16:04.990
PROVISIONS IN HERE.

02:16:05.056 --> 02:16:07.058
THAT.

02:16:07.125 --> 02:16:10.362
IF THE TENANT IS ASSERTING --

02:16:10.428 --> 02:16:13.932
THAT A RATE IS BEING VIOLATED.

02:16:13.999 --> 02:16:15.800
UNDER THIS LEGISLATION UNLESS

02:16:15.867 --> 02:16:17.669
IT'S BEEN AMENDED I THINK THEY

02:16:17.736 --> 02:16:19.804
HAVE TO IN THEIR COMMUNICATION

02:16:19.871 --> 02:16:21.139
WITH THE LANDLORD.

02:16:21.206 --> 02:16:23.008
HAVE A PHOTOCOPY OF THE

02:16:23.074 --> 02:16:25.477
CASHIER'S CHECK TO COVER THE

02:16:25.544 --> 02:16:27.746
RENT THAT'S BEING CONTESTED IS

02:16:27.812 --> 02:16:29.047
THAT CORRECT.

02:16:29.114 --> 02:16:31.216
EXACTLY IN THE PURPOSE OF THAT

02:16:31.283 --> 02:16:33.351
IS TO DEMONSTRATE TO THE

02:16:33.418 --> 02:16:34.986
LANDLORD THAT THEY'RE PREPARED

02:16:35.053 --> 02:16:36.187
TO PAY THEIR RENT.

02:16:36.254 --> 02:16:39.624
BUT THEY FIRST WANT TO ADDRESS.

02:16:39.691 --> 02:16:41.893
THE ISSUE AT HAND IN WELL THAT

02:16:41.960 --> 02:16:44.029
RENT BE REDUCED WILL IT BE WAVES

02:16:44.095 --> 02:16:45.664
FOR THAT MONTH DEPENDING.

02:16:45.730 --> 02:16:47.332
PERHAPS ON THE COST OF THE

02:16:47.399 --> 02:16:49.100
NECESSARY REPAIR.

02:16:49.167 --> 02:16:50.936
RIGHT THIS DOES NOT TRY TO DO

02:16:51.002 --> 02:16:52.571
WHAT OTHER SOME OTHER PROVISIONS

02:16:52.637 --> 02:16:54.172
THE LAW DO IN TERMS OF OF

02:16:54.239 --> 02:16:55.640
DECIDING WHAT THE CORRECT

02:16:55.707 --> 02:16:57.409
RENTERS SO IT IS SIMPLY A

02:16:57.475 --> 02:16:58.510
WITHHOLDING DURING THE

02:16:58.577 --> 02:16:59.978
NEGOTIATING PERIOD.

02:17:00.045 --> 02:17:02.447
AND THEN THE RENT GETS TURNED

02:17:02.514 --> 02:17:03.615
OVER TO LANDMARK IN I WOULD.

02:17:03.682 --> 02:17:05.050
THANK A DEMONSTRATION OF GOOD

02:17:05.116 --> 02:17:05.250
FAITH.

02:17:05.317 --> 02:17:07.319
THAT.

02:17:07.385 --> 02:17:11.456
THE TENANT IS WILLING TO DEFER.

02:17:11.523 --> 02:17:13.892
TO AN OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT FROM.

02:17:13.959 --> 02:17:16.595
WAR.

02:17:16.661 --> 02:17:18.363
THE ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE.

02:17:18.430 --> 02:17:21.032
A RESOLUTION WITHOUT FEARING OF

02:17:21.099 --> 02:17:21.600
FICTION DURING THE COURSE OF

02:17:21.666 --> 02:17:22.634
THAT [inaudible]

02:17:22.701 --> 02:17:23.835
NEGOTIATION.

02:17:23.902 --> 02:17:25.870
RIGHT I MEAN.

02:17:25.937 --> 02:17:27.205
THEY'RE THEY'RE GONNA PAY

02:17:27.272 --> 02:17:28.673
THEY'RE PAYING THE RENT.

02:17:28.740 --> 02:17:29.975
AND I GETTING OUT OF PAYING THE

02:17:30.041 --> 02:17:32.777
RENT THEY'RE NOT USING THIS FOR

02:17:32.844 --> 02:17:34.346
ANYTHING ELSE EXCEPT FOR A

02:17:34.412 --> 02:17:37.048
SPECIFIC REASON THAT THEY HAVE.

02:17:37.115 --> 02:17:38.984
TO GIVE NOTICE TO THE LANDLORD

02:17:39.050 --> 02:17:40.318
THESE ARE THE ISSUES.

02:17:40.385 --> 02:17:42.921
AND OVER THIRTY DAY PERIOD LET'S

02:17:42.988 --> 02:17:44.356
RESOLVE THE ISSUES AND THAT'S

02:17:44.422 --> 02:17:46.725
EXACTLY WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN.

02:17:46.791 --> 02:17:48.727
BUT WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS

02:17:48.793 --> 02:17:49.894
ELIMINATE THE FEAR.

02:17:49.961 --> 02:17:52.397
OF RETALIATION ONE ELIMINATE THE

02:17:52.464 --> 02:17:54.566
FEAR OF THE FICTION SO THAT

02:17:54.633 --> 02:17:55.700
THERE'S SOME.

02:17:55.767 --> 02:17:58.236
YOU KNOW EQUITY ON THE SIDE OF

02:17:58.303 --> 02:18:00.038
THE TENANTS RIGHT NOW.

02:18:00.105 --> 02:18:01.906
THEY COULD YOU KNOW IT'S NO GOOD%

02:18:01.973 --> 02:18:04.542
NO BECAUSE EVICTIONS YOU CAN DO

02:18:04.609 --> 02:18:06.244
IT FOR FOR ANY REASON.

02:18:06.311 --> 02:18:08.413
UNLESS YOU GET A LANDLORD TO SAY

02:18:08.480 --> 02:18:10.448
THE REASON I'M DIRECTING YOU IS

02:18:10.515 --> 02:18:13.818
BECAUSE YOU ARE ORGANIZING YOUR

02:18:13.885 --> 02:18:14.819
NEIGHBORS.

02:18:14.886 --> 02:18:16.187
I DON'T USUALLY GET ALL THAT

02:18:16.254 --> 02:18:18.156
BRING MORE PRECISION AND FOCUS

02:18:18.223 --> 02:18:20.825
TO WHAT'S WHAT'S REALLY AT ISSUE.

02:18:20.892 --> 02:18:22.527
IF I COULD MANAGERS TO FINAL

02:18:22.594 --> 02:18:24.329
QUESTION TO THE OPPONENTS

02:18:24.396 --> 02:18:25.897
REPRESENTATIVE.

02:18:25.964 --> 02:18:27.699
I THINK YOU STATED THAT.

02:18:27.766 --> 02:18:28.600
UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT

02:18:28.667 --> 02:18:30.568
TENANTS ARE FREE TO ORGANIZE

02:18:30.635 --> 02:18:31.636
RIGHT NOW.

02:18:31.703 --> 02:18:33.438
ABSOLUTELY THREE OR FOUR OF THEM

02:18:33.505 --> 02:18:34.673
CONSIDER ON THE KITCHEN TABLE

02:18:34.739 --> 02:18:39.811
AND DISCUSS SHARED CONCERNS OF

02:18:39.878 --> 02:18:41.813
BATHROOMS SEWER RODENTS OR

02:18:41.880 --> 02:18:43.515
WHATEVER THE CONCERN MIGHT BE

02:18:43.581 --> 02:18:44.549
HERE RIGHT.

02:18:44.616 --> 02:18:46.751
SO IF THIS CODIFIES AN EXISTING

02:18:46.818 --> 02:18:49.621
RIGHT IT DOESN'T REALLY CHANGE.

02:18:49.688 --> 02:18:51.790
THE LAW DOES MUCH MORE THAN THAT

02:18:51.856 --> 02:18:52.824
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE

02:18:52.891 --> 02:18:55.093
GRIEVANCES ARE.

02:18:55.160 --> 02:18:56.561
ANY A GRIEVANCE INCLUDES A RENT

02:18:56.628 --> 02:18:57.996
INCREASE.

02:18:58.063 --> 02:19:02.133
A GRIEVANCE INCLUDES THE

02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:02.634
INTERFERENCE WITH QUIET

02:19:02.701 --> 02:19:03.868
ENJOYMENT.

02:19:03.935 --> 02:19:04.502
SO QUITE ENJOYING IT COULD BE

02:19:04.569 --> 02:19:05.904
THE NEIGHBORS THAT ARE MAKING A

02:19:05.970 --> 02:19:08.006
FUSS OR HAVING PARTIES SO WHAT

02:19:08.073 --> 02:19:09.240
I'M GONNA BIG THAT TENET BUT

02:19:09.307 --> 02:19:10.442
THAT TEN IS PART OF THE TENANTS

02:19:10.508 --> 02:19:11.743
ASSOCIATION.

02:19:11.810 --> 02:19:13.378
NOW I CAN'T EVEN THEM AND YET

02:19:13.445 --> 02:19:14.946
THEY'RE CREATING THE CAUSE OF

02:19:15.013 --> 02:19:16.247
THE QUITE ENJOYMENT SO THE

02:19:16.314 --> 02:19:19.751
CONFUSION HERE AND ADDED.

02:19:19.818 --> 02:19:21.753
PROVISIONS TO STATE LAW IS NOT

02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:23.922
JUST A TENANTS ASSOCIATION IT'S

02:19:23.988 --> 02:19:24.522
SO MUCH MORE [inaudible]

02:19:24.589 --> 02:19:28.126
BUT UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT.

02:21:43.061 --> 02:21:44.362
THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME LEGAL

02:21:44.429 --> 02:21:46.364
RECOURSE THERE BUT JUST IN TERMS

02:21:46.431 --> 02:21:48.800

THAT CPI ISSUE IS THAT IS THAT A

02:21:57.108 --> 02:21:58.142
CRITICAL PIECE OF THIS BILL FOR

02:21:58.209 --> 02:21:58.543

02:21:58.610 --> 02:21:59.944
WELL THERE IS.

02:22:00.011 --> 02:22:04.015
THIS HAVE TO BE A IT'S LISTED AS

02:22:04.082 --> 02:22:05.884
ONE OF THE REASONS.

02:22:05.950 --> 02:22:08.319
RIGHT OF A GRIEVANCES THAT COULD

02:22:08.386 --> 02:22:11.422
BE LISTED OUGHT TO THE LANDLORD

02:22:11.489 --> 02:22:12.957
BY THE TENANTS SAYING.

02:22:13.024 --> 02:22:15.593
WE WANT TO NEGOTIATE OVER THIS

02:22:15.660 --> 02:22:16.461
SO.

02:22:16.527 --> 02:22:18.229
RENT INCREASE COULD BE IT COULD

02:22:18.296 --> 02:22:20.164
BE BECAUSE LAST MONTH THERE WAS

02:22:20.231 --> 02:22:22.133
A HUNDRED DOLLAR RENT INCREASE

02:22:22.200 --> 02:22:23.701
AND SO LIKE TO DO IT AGAIN A

02:22:23.768 --> 02:22:25.303
COUPLE OF MONTHS LATER.

02:22:25.370 --> 02:22:26.938
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO GET RID OF

02:22:27.005 --> 02:22:27.872
THOSE.

02:22:27.939 --> 02:22:30.842
ATTENDANCE AND AND BE ABLE TO

02:22:30.909 --> 02:22:32.977
RENT IT OUT AT MUCH MUCH HIGHER

02:22:33.044 --> 02:22:34.112
SO.

02:22:34.178 --> 02:22:37.215
YES RENT INCREASES ONE ISSUE.

02:22:37.282 --> 02:22:39.384
THAT COULD BE A REASON FOR A

02:22:39.450 --> 02:22:41.819
GRIEVANCE A LONG LINE ALONG THE

02:22:41.886 --> 02:22:44.355
LINES OF OTHER OF OTHER ISSUES

02:22:44.422 --> 02:22:45.823
SO IT'S REALLY ABOUT IT'S NOT

02:22:45.890 --> 02:22:47.325
CONTROLLING THE RENT.

02:22:47.392 --> 02:22:48.359

WE WANT TO BE FAIR WE WANT TO BE

02:22:52.363 --> 02:22:56.601
REASONABLE -- ABOUT IT -- AND SO

02:22:56.668 --> 02:22:58.269
THEY CAN DO THAT THEY WOULD HOLD

02:22:58.336 --> 02:22:59.771
IT THE COULD WITHHOLD THE RENT

02:22:59.837 --> 02:23:00.939
FOR THE MONTH BUT THEN.

02:23:01.005 --> 02:23:02.473
THEY HAVE TO PROVE THAT THE

02:23:02.540 --> 02:23:04.042
MONEY IS THERE THEY'RE PUTTING

02:23:04.108 --> 02:23:05.710
IT UP FRONT THEY HAVE TO PUT UP

02:23:05.777 --> 02:23:09.213
A COPY OF THE CASHIER'S CHECK.

02:23:09.280 --> 02:23:10.448
TO SHOW THAT THEY'RE PAYING.

02:23:10.515 --> 02:23:12.850
THEY HAVE TO GIVE THAT CHECK.

02:23:12.917 --> 02:23:14.786
AFTER THIRTY DAYS THEY HAVE TO

02:23:14.852 --> 02:23:15.853
GIVE THE CHECK SO THEY ACTUALLY

02:23:15.920 --> 02:23:17.322
END UP PAYING.

02:23:17.388 --> 02:23:19.190
THEY DON'T SKIP PAYING THE RENT

02:23:19.257 --> 02:23:21.492
BUT THEY JUST TO GET THE

02:23:21.559 --> 02:23:22.894
LANDLORDS ATTENTION.

02:23:22.961 --> 02:23:25.330
AND TO HAVE SOME STRENGTH ON

02:23:25.396 --> 02:23:27.398
THEIR SIDE VERSES.

02:23:27.465 --> 02:23:28.800
I'M NOT GOING TO YOU KNOW I'M

02:23:28.866 --> 02:23:30.134

DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO ALL I

02:23:31.569 --> 02:23:33.004
DON'T HAVE TO GIVE YOU A CAUSE

02:23:33.071 --> 02:23:34.939
FOR MY EBAY AUCTION.

02:23:35.006 --> 02:23:36.274
I GUESS I I JUST SEE THAT THAT

02:23:36.341 --> 02:23:37.976
PROVISION BEING USED.

02:23:38.042 --> 02:23:38.910
EVERYWHERE IN THE STATE OF

02:23:38.977 --> 02:23:41.446
CALIFORNIA I'VE HAD MY REJECT UP

02:23:41.512 --> 02:23:42.480
THREE HUNDRED BUCKS A MONTH -- I

LIKE IT'S A BIG. ONE THOUSAND

02:23:51.189 --> 02:23:53.124
PEOPLE THERE -- BUT YOU DO YOU

02:23:53.191 --> 02:23:54.726
ANTICIPATE THAT PROVISION BEING

02:23:54.792 --> 02:23:57.795
EXERCISED VERY FREQUENTLY I KNOW

02:23:57.862 --> 02:23:59.364
WE LIMITED NOW TO TWICE.

02:23:59.430 --> 02:24:03.234
A YEAR YES SORRY YEAH IS THAT

02:24:03.301 --> 02:24:03.735
RIGHT WITH THE IMMENSE.

02:24:03.801 --> 02:24:05.570
BUT IN THIS IS GONNA BE.

02:24:05.636 --> 02:24:07.138
OF ALL THE PROVISION OF ALL THE

02:24:07.205 --> 02:24:08.940
GRIEVANCES THAT MAKE THIS KIND

02:24:09.007 --> 02:24:11.976
OF RENT STRIKE ELIGIBLE.

02:24:12.043 --> 02:24:13.578
THAT ONE SEEMS TO BE MEAN RENT

02:24:13.644 --> 02:24:15.313
IS INCREASING AT AN ACROSS THE

02:24:15.380 --> 02:24:19.317
BOARD SO AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE --

02:24:19.384 --> 02:24:21.853
TO HAVE A FAIR RATE INCREASE BUT

02:24:21.919 --> 02:24:23.855
THAT'S BETWEEN THE LANDLORD AND

02:24:23.921 --> 02:24:24.922
THE TENANT.

02:24:24.989 --> 02:24:26.924
THAT'S BETWEEN THEM RIGHT NOW

02:24:26.991 --> 02:24:28.626
IT'S IT'S ONLY UP TO THE

02:24:28.693 --> 02:24:30.728
LANDLORD TO DECIDE AS MUCH AS

02:24:30.795 --> 02:24:32.096
THEY WANT.

02:24:32.163 --> 02:24:33.731
TO THEY COULD DO IT -- AS HIGH

02:24:33.798 --> 02:24:35.466
AS THEY WANT AND THAT'S THE END

02:24:35.533 --> 02:24:36.467
OF THE STORY.

02:24:36.534 --> 02:24:38.403
THIS AT LEAST GIVES A TENANTS

02:24:38.469 --> 02:24:40.872
THE OPPORTUNITY. TO BE ABLE TO

02:24:40.938 --> 02:24:42.640
DISCUSS THAT AND WHAT'S

02:24:42.707 --> 02:24:44.142
SOMETHING THAT'S MORE FAIR SO

02:24:44.208 --> 02:24:45.543
WHAT WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE'S AN

02:24:45.610 --> 02:24:46.611
IMPASSE THAT WHAT HAPPENS IF THE

02:24:46.677 --> 02:24:47.211
LANDLORD SAYS.

02:24:47.278 --> 02:24:47.945
NO.

02:24:48.012 --> 02:24:49.981
THAT IS A PRECIADO YOU SET ASIDE

02:24:50.048 --> 02:24:52.216
THE MONEY LIKE THIS IS JUSTIFIED

02:24:52.283 --> 02:24:55.653
BY THE MARKET AND WHAT IT IS IN

02:24:55.720 --> 02:24:56.687
THE REGION AND IT'S NOT.

02:24:56.754 --> 02:24:58.356
INTENDED TO KICK YOU OUT BUT

OF REASONABLY DECLINED THE THE

02:25:20.511 --> 02:25:22.580
BASIS FOR THE RESULT THIS IS.

02:25:22.647 --> 02:25:24.348
THIS IS REALLY.

02:25:24.415 --> 02:25:26.617
A VERY SIMPLE WHITE TOUCH IT

02:25:26.684 --> 02:25:29.454
BASICALLY SAYS THAT FOR THIRTY

02:25:29.520 --> 02:25:30.455
DAYS [inaudible]

THAT THEY ARE GOING TO PAY THE

02:25:39.297 --> 02:25:40.965
RENT AT THE END OF THE THIRTY

02:25:41.032 --> 02:25:43.434
DAYS BUT THE ATTEMPT THE EFFORT

HAVE NO RIGHT TO COUNSEL AND

02:26:45.763 --> 02:26:46.998
THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE THEIR HOME

02:26:47.064 --> 02:26:48.466

BECAUSE THEY WILL LOSE THEIR

CHAPTER AND I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO

IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT

03:02:19.695 --> 03:02:20.863
YOU INTEND BY THAT.

03:02:20.929 --> 03:02:21.697
ABSOLUTELY THAT'S A GREAT

03:02:21.764 --> 03:02:24.300
QUESTION -- SO THAT'S JUST ONE

03:02:24.366 --> 03:02:26.001
REFERENCE THE FEDERAL CODE TO

03:02:26.068 --> 03:02:27.569
ONE PROCUREMENT Là THAT'S THE

03:02:27.636 --> 03:02:29.705
BY AMERICA PROGRAM -- AND THAT

03:02:29.772 --> 03:02:30.572
IS FROM THE DEPARTMENT

03:02:30.639 --> 03:02:32.808
TRANSPORTATION FOR GRANTS THAT --

03:02:32.875 --> 03:02:35.377
THAT -- DEPARTMENT GIVES TO

03:02:35.444 --> 03:02:36.945
LOCAL AND STATE AGENCIES --

03:02:37.012 --> 03:02:38.347
WHERE THERE ARE REQUIREMENTS

03:02:38.414 --> 03:02:40.316
ATTACHED TO GRANTS OF A CERTAIN

03:02:40.382 --> 03:02:42.251
DOLLAR AMOUNT THE REQUIRES STEEL

DOMESTICALLY THAT'S THAT'S ONE

03:02:49.958 --> 03:02:51.293
EXAMPLE AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THE

03:02:51.360 --> 03:02:53.262
THE BROADER PROVISION JUST MEANS --

03:02:53.329 --> 03:02:54.997
THAT THERE ARE STATE AND LOCAL

03:02:55.064 --> 03:02:57.433
LAWS THAT SIMILARLY REQUIRE --

03:02:57.499 --> 03:02:59.101
PROCUREMENT TO TAKE PLACE IN A

03:02:59.168 --> 03:03:00.969
CERTAIN WAY YOU KNOW BE -- BY

03:03:01.036 --> 03:03:03.272
AMERICA -- ANTI SWEATSHOP THINGS

03:03:03.339 --> 03:03:07.109
LIKE THAT -- SO THAT'S WHAT THAT --

03:03:07.176 --> 03:03:09.278
SECTION APPLIES.

03:03:09.345 --> 03:03:11.313
TO YOUR STAND IS THAT IS YOU

03:03:11.380 --> 03:03:12.147
KNOW IT'S ALWAYS THE THINGS THAT

03:03:12.214 --> 03:03:12.815
YOU DON'T.

03:03:12.881 --> 03:03:14.049
PAY ATTENTION TO THAT YOU'RE

03:03:14.116 --> 03:03:15.484
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THAT LATER

03:03:15.551 --> 03:03:17.286
COME BACK AND I WHAT I'M TRYING

03:03:17.353 --> 03:03:19.488
TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT IS IS I

03:03:19.555 --> 03:03:22.124
UNDERSTAND CONTRACTS WHERE --

03:03:22.191 --> 03:03:25.327
WHERE YOU HAVE -- PEOPLE WORKING

03:03:25.394 --> 03:03:26.428
BUT IF YOU'RE BUYING MATERIALS

03:03:26.495 --> 03:03:28.263
AND GOODS.

03:03:28.330 --> 03:03:32.334
THEN -- THEN I'M CONCERNED ABOUT --

03:03:32.401 --> 03:03:34.636
EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE ARTICULATING

03:03:34.703 --> 03:03:36.472
HAS TO BE DISCLOSED.

03:03:36.538 --> 03:03:41.210
IN THIS -- AT NEW LAW I THINK

03:03:41.276 --> 03:03:42.578
WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS THAT

03:03:42.644 --> 03:03:43.979
IT'S ONLY PURSUANT TO AN

03:03:44.046 --> 03:03:46.715
AGREEMENT A CONTRACT OR LAW.

03:03:46.782 --> 03:03:48.217
IT DOESN'T SAY IF YOU IF THERE'S

03:03:48.283 --> 03:03:50.652
NO APPLICABLE PROCUREMENT Là.

03:03:50.719 --> 03:03:51.987
THERE'S NO.

03:03:52.054 --> 03:03:54.189
REQUIREMENT THAT DOCUMENTS BE

03:03:54.256 --> 03:03:56.658
DISCLOSED UNDER THIS -- AND THIS

03:03:56.725 --> 03:03:57.993
PROVISION BUT IF WE ARE

03:03:58.060 --> 03:04:00.763
LEGISLATING. TO PROCURE IN A WAY

03:04:00.829 --> 03:04:02.097
THAT WE THAT WE WANT TO SEE

03:04:02.164 --> 03:04:04.333
BENEFITS GO TO OUR COMMUNITIES

03:04:04.400 --> 03:04:05.501
THIS JUST SAYS.

03:04:05.567 --> 03:04:07.269
THE RECORDS OF COMPLIANCE TO

03:04:07.336 --> 03:04:09.304
THOSE LAWS AND AGREEMENTS ARE

03:04:09.371 --> 03:04:10.506
NOT TRADE SECRETS.

03:04:10.572 --> 03:04:12.040
AND I'D I ALSO WANT TO SAY I I

03:04:12.107 --> 03:04:13.776
DON'T THINK THAT THIS EXPAND THE

03:04:13.842 --> 03:04:15.110
DEFINITION UNDER EXISTING

03:04:15.177 --> 03:04:16.211
DECISIONAL Là.

03:04:16.278 --> 03:04:17.579
I THINK THOSE DOCUMENTSARE

03:04:17.646 --> 03:04:19.381
GENERALLY ALREADY AVAILABLE THE

03:04:19.448 --> 03:04:22.618
PROBLEM IS IS THAT NOW.

03:04:37.533 --> 03:04:38.667
AND WE ARE JUST PROVIDING

03:04:38.734 --> 03:04:40.169
LEGISLATIVE GUIDANCE TO THE KIND

03:04:40.235 --> 03:04:42.171
OF DOCUMENTS THAT THOSE --

03:04:42.237 --> 03:04:44.540
AGENCIES NEED -- TO TURN OVER I

03:04:44.606 --> 03:04:46.241
GUESS MY CONCERN IS THIS IS THAT

03:04:46.308 --> 03:04:47.309
I'VE BEEN I'VE BEEN THINKING

03:04:47.376 --> 03:04:48.610
THERE I'M THINKING LOCAL

03:04:48.677 --> 03:04:50.045
GOVERNMENT KIND OF CONTRACTS AT

03:04:50.112 --> 03:04:51.513

FIX THE ROAD DO SOME WORK AROUND

03:04:53.715 --> 03:04:55.517
THE COMMUNITY -- THE STATE

03:04:55.584 --> 03:04:57.719
CONTRACTS FAIRLY SIGNIFICANTLY

03:04:57.786 --> 03:04:59.388
WITH COMPANIES THAT DO

03:04:59.455 --> 03:05:01.290
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND WE

03:05:01.356 --> 03:05:03.292

IN THE HIGH TECH AND THAT AND

03:05:04.827 --> 03:05:08.163
THAT -- THAT -- THE HIGH TECH

03:05:14.903 --> 03:05:17.906
EVERYTHING THAT WE BY -- I'M I'M

03:05:17.973 --> 03:05:19.475
TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON WHAT

LIKE I SAID I LIKE THE CONCEPT

03:05:26.815 --> 03:05:28.684
AND IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE WHEN

03:05:28.750 --> 03:05:29.218
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT REAL

03:05:29.284 --> 03:05:31.320
CONCRETE -- PROJECTS THAT YOU DO

03:05:31.386 --> 03:05:32.788
IT LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUT AT THE

STATE LEVEL I'M JUST TRYING TO

03:05:34.056 --> 03:05:35.390
GET A SENSE OF HOW FAR HOW

03:05:35.457 --> 03:05:37.259
BROADER WE GOING WITH THIS.

03:05:37.326 --> 03:05:39.294

CONTRACTING WITH AND AND AND

03:05:46.268 --> 03:05:48.136
FRANKLY PART OF THE CHALLENGES

03:05:48.203 --> 03:05:50.005
IS SOMETIMES OUR SPECIFICATIONS

03:05:50.072 --> 03:05:51.440

03:05:51.507 --> 03:05:52.641
THAT THEY CAN'T MEET THE

03:05:52.708 --> 03:05:54.009
SPECIFICATIONS AND WE END UP

03:05:54.076 --> 03:05:55.410
WITH ONE VENDOR.

03:05:55.477 --> 03:05:57.579
AND AND SO DO WE THEN PLACE

03:05:57.646 --> 03:05:59.481
OURSELVES IN A POSITION WHERE WE

03:05:59.548 --> 03:06:01.250

THESE LAWS.

THEN THERE COMPLIANCE REPORTS

03:06:53.602 --> 03:06:57.272

TO MAKE SURE ARE ARE USING THE

03:07:16.425 --> 03:07:17.926
TAXPAYER DOLLARS WHILE THE

03:07:17.993 --> 03:07:20.028
PROVIDE GOOD PUBLIC SERVICES SO --

03:07:20.095 --> 03:07:21.396
WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE THE REMAINING

03:07:21.463 --> 03:07:22.965
AQUINNAH CORE CONCERNS FOR OUR

03:07:23.031 --> 03:07:24.766
PUBLIC AGENCIES SO AGAIN IT'S

03:07:24.833 --> 03:07:26.969
WHAT WE GO A WEEK WE CONTRACT

03:07:27.035 --> 03:07:28.971
FOR A LOT OF VERY SERVICES -- IT

03:07:29.037 --> 03:07:30.973
COULD BE FOR EMPLOYEES FOR

03:07:31.039 --> 03:07:32.574
CERTAIN PROJECT TO COULD BE TO

03:07:32.641 --> 03:07:34.977
DO A PROJECT -- THE FORD SOME OF

03:07:35.043 --> 03:07:35.744
OUR SOME SMALLER SPECIAL

03:07:35.811 --> 03:07:37.346
DISTRICTS THAT HAVE ONE OR TWO

03:07:37.412 --> 03:07:39.081
EMPLOYEES -- VIRTUALLY

03:07:39.147 --> 03:07:40.215
EVERYTHING THAT THAT THEY'RE

03:07:40.282 --> 03:07:42.117
DOING IS A A CONTRACT OF SOME%

03:07:42.184 --> 03:07:43.285
KIND.

03:07:43.352 --> 03:07:45.587
THE FEAR IS THAT THE WE'RE GOING

03:07:45.654 --> 03:07:46.989
TO HAVE A REDUCTION IN THE

03:07:47.055 --> 03:07:48.790
NUMBER OF COMPANIES THAT WOULD

03:07:48.857 --> 03:07:50.459
BID ON THE PROJECTS WERE PUTTING

03:07:50.525 --> 03:07:51.593
OUT FOR BID.

03:07:51.660 --> 03:07:53.161
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE

03:07:53.228 --> 03:07:55.163
SUBJECT TO THE DISCLOSURE

03:07:55.230 --> 03:07:58.767
REQUIREMENTS -- THAT THAT ARE.

03:07:58.834 --> 03:08:03.005
THE RESULT OF THIS BILL -- ONE

03:08:03.071 --> 03:08:04.172
OF THE THINGS THAT THE WE

03:08:04.239 --> 03:08:06.008
RECEIVED RIGHT NOW IN CONTRACTS

03:08:06.074 --> 03:08:08.377
IS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WHERE

03:08:08.443 --> 03:08:09.811
FOLKS SHOULD RIGHT ON IN THE IN

03:08:09.878 --> 03:08:11.580
ON THE CONTRACT -- THIS IS A

03:08:11.647 --> 03:08:12.781
TRADE SECRET BUT THEY'RE TRYING

03:08:12.848 --> 03:08:14.416
TO PROVIDE US IS IS MUCH

03:08:14.483 --> 03:08:16.251
INFORMATION AS THEY CAN WHEN WE

03:08:16.318 --> 03:08:17.486
GO THROUGH THE DECISION MAKING

03:08:17.552 --> 03:08:19.087
PROCESS ON WHICH BITS WE'RE

03:08:19.154 --> 03:08:20.656
GOING TO PROVE OR NOT.

03:08:20.722 --> 03:08:22.024
SO THE RESULT IS THAT THEY WERE

03:08:22.090 --> 03:08:22.891
GOING TO HAVE LESS FOLKS

03:08:22.958 --> 03:08:24.760
SUBMITTING BIDS OR THERE'S GOING

03:08:24.826 --> 03:08:26.294
TO BE LESS INFORMATION INCLUDED

03:08:26.361 --> 03:08:27.796
IN THE BIZ FOR US TO MAKE THAT

03:08:27.863 --> 03:08:29.097
DECISION.

03:08:29.164 --> 03:08:32.267
NOW IT I'M NOT SURE HOW DRAMATIC

03:08:32.334 --> 03:08:33.835
THIS IS GOING TO BE BUT IS A

03:08:33.902 --> 03:08:34.836
GOOD IT IS A CONCERN AND THAT'S

03:08:34.903 --> 03:08:36.571
WHAT SAID WHERE WE'RE GOING TO

03:08:36.638 --> 03:08:37.406
EVALUATE OUR POSITION ON THIS

03:08:37.472 --> 03:08:38.073
BILL.

03:08:41.176 --> 03:08:42.577
REMOVING SECTION TWO WHICH IS

03:08:42.644 --> 03:08:43.779
OUR MAJOR CONCERN.

03:08:43.845 --> 03:08:45.313

THERE'S TWO ISSUES RAISED THE

03:08:56.658 --> 03:08:59.061
LITIGATION ISSUE IS WHAT WE'RE

03:08:59.127 --> 03:08:59.995
TRYING TO ELIMINATE.

03:09:00.062 --> 03:09:01.263
THAT'S THE FIRST THING RIGHT NOW

03:09:01.329 --> 03:09:02.597
PUBLIC INTEREST GROUP A GROUP

03:09:02.664 --> 03:09:04.499
LIKE MINE IF THE IF AN AGENCY IF

03:09:04.566 --> 03:09:06.601
A COMPANY SAYS IT'S A TRADE

03:09:06.668 --> 03:09:07.569
SECRET EVEN AND THEY NOTED IN

03:09:07.636 --> 03:09:09.171
THEIR DOCUMENT.

03:09:09.237 --> 03:09:10.839
BUT IT'S NOT A TRADE SECRET OR

03:09:10.906 --> 03:09:12.374
WE ARE THE PUBLIC A WE DETERMINE

03:09:12.441 --> 03:09:13.742
IT'S NOT ATTRACTIVE.

03:09:13.809 --> 03:09:15.210
WE OFTEN HAVE TO SUE TO GET IT

03:09:15.277 --> 03:09:16.244
AND WE ARE THE MONEY TO DO THAT

03:09:16.311 --> 03:09:17.713

THIS WAS AN INSURANCE BEFORE --

03:21:08.456 --> 03:21:11.526
SOMETHING STRUCK ME -- AGE TO

WORK AT A WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT

03:21:13.461 --> 03:21:16.364

03:21:16.431 --> 03:21:19.333
I WAS RESEARCHING -- GO IN

03:21:19.400 --> 03:21:20.601

03:21:20.668 --> 03:21:22.336
I CAME ACROSS SOMETHING THAT'S

03:21:22.403 --> 03:21:24.071
THAT TALKED ABOUT HOW DIVERSE

03:21:24.138 --> 03:21:26.040
THIS LAW FIRM WAS.

STANDARD APPLIES AND I DON'T

03:43:54.020 --> 03:43:55.054

ORDERING PIZZA AND APPARENTLY

03:45:08.328 --> 03:45:10.196
WE'RE GOING TO BE HERE FOR SOME

03:45:10.263 --> 03:45:15.568
TIME TO ACT -- BUT THERE WE GO

03:45:15.635 --> 03:45:19.772
THERE WE GO -- I WANTED -- TO TO

03:45:19.839 --> 03:45:23.409
CONGRATULATE YOU ON TAKING A

03:45:23.476 --> 03:45:28.581
BITE I AT WAYS TO IMPROVE --

03:45:28.648 --> 03:45:30.116
THIS PROCESS.

03:45:30.183 --> 03:45:31.718
MY UNDERSTANDING BASED ON WHAT'S

03:45:31.784 --> 03:45:33.319
BEEN REPRESENTED IN THERE IN THE

03:45:33.386 --> 03:45:34.988
MATERIAL THAT I'VE READ IS.

03:45:35.054 --> 03:45:37.957
YOU DON'T CHANGE SEEK WHAT.

03:45:38.024 --> 03:45:40.593
YOU ARE TRYING TO EXPEDITE THE

03:45:40.660 --> 03:45:44.397
JUDICIAL PROCESS ON ON CRITICAL

03:45:44.464 --> 03:45:46.099
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEED IN

03:45:46.165 --> 03:45:47.600
THIS STATE.

03:45:47.667 --> 03:45:51.070
AND SO I KNOW A LOT OF FOLKS ARE.

03:45:51.137 --> 03:45:51.604
GOING TO TRY TO COMPLETELY

03:45:51.671 --> 03:45:53.873
ISSUES -- BUT I THINK IT'S

03:45:53.940 --> 03:45:56.209
IMPORTANT THAT WE LOOK UPON THEM

03:45:56.276 --> 03:45:57.744
WITH SEPARATION.

03:45:57.810 --> 03:45:58.878
IS THAT SEEK WAS NOT BEING

03:45:58.945 --> 03:46:00.179
UNDERMINED.

03:46:00.246 --> 03:46:02.582
AND I THINK TO WHAT TWO HUNDRED

03:46:02.649 --> 03:46:05.652
SEVENTY DAYS IS WHAT NINE MONTHS --

03:46:05.718 --> 03:46:08.321
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY.

03:46:08.388 --> 03:46:09.956
THINGS CANNOT WRAP UP IN THAT

03:46:10.023 --> 03:46:12.592
PERIOD OF TIME -- GIVEN THE FACT

03:46:12.659 --> 03:46:14.427
THAT WE'VE CREATED EXCEPTIONS

03:46:14.494 --> 03:46:17.196
FOR LARGE SPORT COMPLEXES AND

03:46:17.263 --> 03:46:21.067
OTHER -- MAJOR AMENITIES THAT WE

03:46:21.134 --> 03:46:23.469
CONSIDER A PUBLIC BENEFIT SO I I

03:46:23.536 --> 03:46:26.205
THINK THIS IS A SMART MOVE.

03:46:26.272 --> 03:46:27.407
IT'S NOT WITHOUT IT'S

03:46:27.473 --> 03:46:30.009
CONTROVERSY I THINK CENTER ALLEN

03:46:30.076 --> 03:46:31.444
BROUGHT UP A POINT THAT.

03:46:31.511 --> 03:46:33.846
WE DON'T WANT TO ENCOURAGE --

03:46:33.913 --> 03:46:35.715
EXPEDITED -- APPROVAL FOR

03:46:35.782 --> 03:46:36.983
PROJECTS.

03:46:37.050 --> 03:46:39.585
IN -- IN HIGH RISK ZONES BUT I

03:46:39.652 --> 03:46:41.387
OF MY BELIEVE THAT SEQUEL WOULD

03:46:41.454 --> 03:46:43.056
REVEAL.

03:46:43.122 --> 03:46:45.458
THE HIGH RISK ZONE AND FRANKLY A

03:46:45.525 --> 03:46:47.026
DEVELOPER WILL PROBABLY NOT BE

03:46:47.093 --> 03:46:49.529
INCLINED ALREADY. TO INVEST IN A

03:46:49.595 --> 03:46:52.131
SUPER RISKY AREA ANYWAYS.

03:46:52.198 --> 03:46:54.167
BUT THAT'S THAT THAT MAY BE

03:46:54.233 --> 03:46:56.235
DEBATED DEBATABLE BUT I'M

03:46:56.302 --> 03:46:58.237
CERTAINLY WILLING TO MOVE

03:46:58.304 --> 03:47:00.640
FORWARD ON THIS TODAY.

03:47:00.707 --> 03:47:02.542
THANK YOU THE OTHER QUESTIONS OR

03:47:02.608 --> 03:47:04.277
COMMENTS.

03:47:04.344 --> 03:47:06.479
I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT I'M

03:47:06.546 --> 03:47:09.248
SORRY SENATOR UMBERG -- I

03:47:09.315 --> 03:47:10.883
APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING HERE FOR

03:47:10.950 --> 03:47:12.719
THE ENTIRE HEARING BUT BUT OF

03:47:12.785 --> 03:47:14.554
WITH RESPECT.

03:47:14.620 --> 03:47:15.788
TO THE THE JUDICIAL COUNCILS

03:47:15.855 --> 03:47:17.590
CONCERNS I'M SURE THAT WERE

03:47:17.657 --> 03:47:18.958
PREVIOUSLY EXPRESSED ABOUT.

03:47:19.025 --> 03:47:20.560
PRIVATIZING CERTAIN MATTERS IN

03:47:20.626 --> 03:47:21.694
THE STRAIN UPON THE COURTS AND

03:47:21.761 --> 03:47:22.996
ACCESS TO JUSTICE I THINK THOSE

03:47:23.062 --> 03:47:24.397
ARE ALL VALID CONCERNS I THINK

03:47:24.464 --> 03:47:26.065
THOSE ARE ALL.

03:47:26.132 --> 03:47:27.400
ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO CONTEND

03:47:27.467 --> 03:47:29.736
WITH -- SHOULD THIS BILL PASS I

03:47:29.802 --> 03:47:33.006
EXPECTED IT WILL -- WILL THEN.

03:47:33.072 --> 03:47:34.307
WE HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH

03:47:34.374 --> 03:47:36.142
OURSELVES THAT BY.

03:47:36.209 --> 03:47:36.943
CREATING ADDITIONAL

03:47:37.010 --> 03:47:38.678
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE COURTS

03:47:38.745 --> 03:47:40.713
WE HAVE TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY

03:47:40.780 --> 03:47:42.348
OF COURTS FOR THE COURTS WILL

03:47:42.415 --> 03:47:45.018
DEAL WITH THIS BECAUSE THE POINT.

03:47:45.084 --> 03:47:45.852
WITH RESPECT TO OTHER

03:47:45.918 --> 03:47:47.520
CONTROVERSIES BEING PUSHED

03:47:47.587 --> 03:47:49.055
FARTHER BACK IS A LEGITIMATE

03:47:49.122 --> 03:47:50.656
POINT AND WE'RE ALREADY AT THE

03:47:50.723 --> 03:47:51.657
BREAKING POINT PARTICULAR IN

03:47:51.724 --> 03:47:53.059
TERMS OF CIVIL JUSTICE.

03:47:53.126 --> 03:47:54.761
AND SO IT'S IT'S A POINT FOR ALL

03:47:54.827 --> 03:47:56.195
OF US WE WE CAN'T SUPPORT THIS

03:47:56.262 --> 03:47:58.364
ABOUT ADDITIONALLY SUPPORTING --

03:47:58.431 --> 03:47:59.799
ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE

03:47:59.866 --> 03:48:01.734
COURTS THANK YOU MEASURE IS

03:48:01.801 --> 03:48:03.102
TONIGHT OUR IDEA.

03:48:03.169 --> 03:48:04.837
I ONE OF JUST FOLLOW UP ON THAT

03:48:04.904 --> 03:48:06.372
BECAUSE I DO AGREE.

03:48:06.439 --> 03:48:07.173
YOU KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER TRIED A

03:48:07.240 --> 03:48:09.742
CASE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS.

03:48:09.809 --> 03:48:12.678
IS A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME --

03:48:12.745 --> 03:48:15.715
MANY CASES -- ACTUALLY LANGUAGE

03:48:15.782 --> 03:48:17.016
FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND EVEN A

03:48:17.083 --> 03:48:19.352
CASE THAT MOVES WITH SOME

03:48:19.419 --> 03:48:21.454
RELATIVE SPEED AS I'M SURE.

03:48:21.521 --> 03:48:23.790
THOSE WHO WHO HAVE EXPERT HAD

03:48:23.856 --> 03:48:29.028
EXPERIENCES LITIGATORS KNOW THAT.

03:48:29.095 --> 03:48:29.629
TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAYS

03:48:29.695 --> 03:48:30.897
WITH THIS IT IT INCLUDES

03:48:30.963 --> 03:48:32.698
SUPERIOR COURT COURT OF APPEAL

03:48:32.765 --> 03:48:34.801
AND OF THE STATE SUPREME COURT

03:48:34.867 --> 03:48:36.235
ALL LEVELS WOULD HAVE TO BE

03:48:36.302 --> 03:48:38.971
CONCLUDED WITHIN TWO HUNDRED

03:48:39.038 --> 03:48:40.173
SEVENTY DAYS THAT'S THAT'S

03:48:40.239 --> 03:48:41.774
UNIMAGINABLE ACTUALLY.

03:48:41.841 --> 03:48:43.943
BUT OF COURSE WE CANNOT DICTATE

03:48:44.010 --> 03:48:45.178
TO THE COURTS SO WE COULD JUST

03:48:45.244 --> 03:48:46.479
URGE THEM AND I THINK WHEN WE

03:48:46.546 --> 03:48:48.981
HAD OUR WE HAD OUR HEARING ON

03:48:49.048 --> 03:48:50.550
THIS AND THE JUDGE.

03:48:50.616 --> 03:48:51.951
OF WHO IS THE EXPERT ON SHE WAS

03:48:52.018 --> 03:48:52.919
SAID THAT.

03:48:52.985 --> 03:48:54.120
YOU KNOW LOTS OF THINGS

03:48:54.187 --> 03:48:55.922
INTERVENE THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT

03:48:55.988 --> 03:48:57.457
IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE.

03:48:57.523 --> 03:48:59.058
AND I THINK OF CONCERN IS A

03:48:59.125 --> 03:49:00.860
POLICY ISSUE FOR SOME OF US

03:49:00.927 --> 03:49:02.628
WHICH IS A CONCERN FOR ME IS

03:49:02.695 --> 03:49:03.563
THAT.

03:49:03.629 --> 03:49:05.131
WE ARE WE WILL THUS BE

03:49:05.198 --> 03:49:07.733
PRIORITIZING SECRET CHALLENGES

03:49:07.800 --> 03:49:10.303
OVER ALL OTHER CASES.

03:49:10.369 --> 03:49:12.738
CIVIL RIGHTS CONSUMER PROTECTION

03:49:12.805 --> 03:49:16.442
ELDER ABUSE -- UNITING FAMILIES

03:49:16.509 --> 03:49:18.444
AND AS MY HUSBAND THE NOW

03:49:18.511 --> 03:49:20.146
RETIRED CRIMINAL LAW OR THE

03:49:20.213 --> 03:49:21.714
CRIMINAL COURTS JUDGE POINTED

03:49:21.781 --> 03:49:22.682
OUT.

03:49:22.748 --> 03:49:24.150
CRIMINAL COURTS HAVE PRIORITY

03:49:24.217 --> 03:49:26.519
REGARDLESS BECAUSE OF THE

03:49:26.586 --> 03:49:28.521
CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE OF THE OF

03:49:28.588 --> 03:49:31.824
A TRIAL -- A QUICK AND SPEEDY

03:49:31.891 --> 03:49:32.959
TRIAL SO.

03:49:33.025 --> 03:49:36.295
WE ARE REALLY I THINK.

03:49:36.362 --> 03:49:37.363
PUTTING A MAJOR KNEE IN THE BACK

03:49:37.430 --> 03:49:39.465
OF OUR COURTS THAT I'M NOT SURE

03:49:39.532 --> 03:49:41.033
WE WON'T ALL COULDN'T ULTIMATELY

03:49:41.100 --> 03:49:42.768
END UP WITH THE WHOLE SYSTEM

03:49:42.835 --> 03:49:45.037
COLLAPSING MAYBE IT WON'T.

03:49:45.104 --> 03:49:47.406
BUT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS

03:49:47.473 --> 03:49:48.975
WE'RE BASICALLY SAYING COURTS

03:49:49.041 --> 03:49:50.443
WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU TWO HUNDRED

03:49:50.510 --> 03:49:52.011
AND SEVENTY DAYS.

03:49:52.078 --> 03:49:53.546
AND OF COURSE TELLING THE COURTS --

03:49:53.613 --> 03:49:54.981
WHEN THEY CAN RESOLVE THE CASES

03:49:55.047 --> 03:49:56.782
LIKE THE COURTS TELLING US WHEN

03:49:56.849 --> 03:49:58.017
THE SAID A BILL?

03:49:58.084 --> 03:49:59.952
I MEAN IT'S THERE IS AN

03:50:00.019 --> 03:50:04.123
INDEPENDENCE IN A OF SPLIT --

03:50:04.190 --> 03:50:05.725
AGAIN -- CONSTITUTIONALLY -- AND

03:50:05.791 --> 03:50:07.026
THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE

03:50:07.093 --> 03:50:09.929
JUDICIARY SO -- IT IT BECOMES A

03:50:09.996 --> 03:50:11.397
REAL QUESTION AND I DON'T KNOW

03:50:11.464 --> 03:50:15.535
THAT THE COURTS HAVE THE

03:50:15.601 --> 03:50:16.836
RESOURCES NOW.

03:50:16.903 --> 03:50:19.572
SO I REALLY ARE I MEAN I'M.

03:50:19.639 --> 03:50:22.141
I AM WEIGHING AND AND I JUST

03:50:22.208 --> 03:50:23.009
WEARING THE THE THE THE FACT

03:50:23.075 --> 03:50:24.977
THAT WE'RE GONNA TELL SENIORS

03:50:25.044 --> 03:50:25.711
WE'RE GONNA TELL PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:50:25.778 --> 03:50:26.479
DYING.

03:50:26.546 --> 03:50:27.980
IN A WITHIN SIX MONTHS AND

03:50:28.047 --> 03:50:29.949
THEY'VE GOT MILLER MISSILES THE

03:50:30.016 --> 03:50:31.284
LEE ALSO SAID THAT WHATEVER GOD

03:50:31.350 --> 03:50:32.818
ONLY KNOWS WHAT IT IS.

03:50:32.885 --> 03:50:33.753
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

03:50:33.819 --> 03:50:36.522
TAKE A BACKSTEP BECAUSE WE HAVE

03:50:36.589 --> 03:50:39.292
TO HEAR THE SEQUEL CASES SO THAT

03:50:39.358 --> 03:50:41.260
IS A THAT IS A REAL CONCERN --

03:50:41.327 --> 03:50:43.596
AND AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO RESPOND

03:50:43.663 --> 03:50:44.797
TO THAT AND THEN CENTER AKOWSKI

03:50:44.864 --> 03:50:47.066
HAS QUESTION.

03:50:47.133 --> 03:50:48.668
AT THAT THANK YOU CHAIR -- I'D

03:50:48.734 --> 03:50:50.002
BE HAPPY TO FIRST THAT THE

03:50:50.069 --> 03:50:51.037
THERE'S A BILL MOVING TO THE

03:50:51.103 --> 03:50:51.971
LEGISLATURE HOPEFULLY IT'S

03:50:52.038 --> 03:50:53.406
MOVING THAT THE LEGISLATURE BY

03:50:53.472 --> 03:50:54.340
SENATOR ROD.

03:50:54.407 --> 03:50:55.908
THAT WOULD ADD JUDGES AND WHEN

03:50:55.975 --> 03:50:56.809
THOSE.

03:50:56.876 --> 03:50:58.544
THOSE BILLS ARE PRESENTED TO US

03:50:58.611 --> 03:51:00.046
ABOUT IT THAT WORKLOAD DEMANDS

03:51:00.112 --> 03:51:01.214
IN THE COURT SYSTEM THAT WE

03:51:01.280 --> 03:51:02.281
SHOULD BE AND I THINK WE HAVE

03:51:02.348 --> 03:51:03.649
BEEN RESPONSIVE TO THOSE AND I

03:51:03.716 --> 03:51:05.484
WOULD EXPECT THAT WE'D BE

03:51:05.551 --> 03:51:07.587
RESPONSIVE TO CENTER RAS BILL --

03:51:07.653 --> 03:51:09.989
TO ADD I THINK OF A FEW OF TWO

03:51:10.056 --> 03:51:11.357
OR THREE DOZEN JUDGES OKAY.

03:51:11.424 --> 03:51:12.792
SECOND THE ARGUMENT IS BEEN THAT

03:51:12.858 --> 03:51:14.327
THERE'S SO FEW CASES THAT SEE

03:51:14.393 --> 03:51:16.295
THE CHEN THE OBJECTION TO BILLS

03:51:16.362 --> 03:51:17.797
LIKE THIS IS THAT WILL HOLD ON

03:51:17.863 --> 03:51:19.265
SICK WAS NOT A PROBLEM.

03:51:19.332 --> 03:51:20.766
AND THERE AREN'T VERY MANY CASES

03:51:20.833 --> 03:51:22.668
AND NOW SOMEHOW IT'S CAN

03:51:22.735 --> 03:51:23.936
OVERWHELM THAT THE COURT SYSTEM.

03:51:24.003 --> 03:51:25.972
A THIRD WE PUT A SUNSET IN THIS

03:51:26.038 --> 03:51:28.374
BILL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WITH

03:51:28.441 --> 03:51:29.942
THAT REQUIREMENT FOR DATA TO BE

03:51:30.009 --> 03:51:31.377
ACCUMULATED THIS TO TRY TO

03:51:31.444 --> 03:51:32.211
ANSWER THAT QUESTION WERE

03:51:32.278 --> 03:51:33.379
CLEARLY IF IT.

03:51:33.446 --> 03:51:34.914
IS CREATING A SIGNIFICANT

03:51:34.981 --> 03:51:36.382
PROBLEM ET'S TAKE A LOOK AT IT.

03:51:36.449 --> 03:51:38.184

03:55:23.943 --> 03:55:25.144
BEEN TRAPPED BY THE RHETORIC

03:55:25.211 --> 03:55:27.480
THAT'S BEEN USED BY ALL SIDES ON

03:55:27.546 --> 03:55:31.350
THIS ISSUE -- BUT BUT LOOK AT I

03:55:31.417 --> 03:55:34.353
I AT WE WE HAVE.

03:55:34.420 --> 03:55:35.654
LET ME FOCUS ON WHAT I THINK IS

03:55:35.721 --> 03:55:36.989
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT I

03:55:37.056 --> 03:55:38.224
I THINK WE ALL CARE ABOUT WHICH

03:55:38.290 --> 03:55:39.558
IS OUR HOUSING CRISIS WE KNOW WE

03:55:39.625 --> 03:55:41.560

03:55:41.627 --> 03:55:42.161
STATE WE TALK ABOUT IT ALL THE

03:55:42.228 --> 03:55:43.162
TIME.

03:55:43.229 --> 03:55:44.930
RIGHT AND WE KNOW THAT THE ONLY

03:55:44.997 --> 03:55:46.065
WAY TO GET OUT OF THAT HOUSING

03:55:46.131 --> 03:55:47.967
CRISIS IS TO THAT TO BUILD MORE

03:55:48.033 --> 03:55:49.635

03:55:49.702 --> 03:55:50.636
HOUSING.

03:55:52.938 --> 03:55:54.473
TO HELP MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

03:55:54.540 --> 03:55:56.008
AND I DON'T THINK THAT --

03:55:56.075 --> 03:55:58.577
CHALLENGES UNDER SYKORA ARE

03:55:58.644 --> 03:56:01.380
GONNA BE THAT THE THE

03:56:01.447 --> 03:56:03.649
CONSEQUENCE OF TRYING TO BUILD A

03:56:03.716 --> 03:56:05.184
PART OF INCENTIVIZE.

03:56:05.251 --> 03:56:06.785

THE BILL MOREHOUSING I I JUST

03:56:09.855 --> 03:56:11.524
DON'T SEE THAT CONSEQUENCES OUT

03:56:11.590 --> 03:56:13.292
THE BILL HAS PROVISIONS TO TRY

03:56:13.359 --> 03:56:14.660
TO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM THAT

03:56:14.727 --> 03:56:15.794
AS I'VE MENTIONED.

03:56:15.861 --> 03:56:17.530

03:56:37.349 --> 03:56:38.884
APPROPRIATELY IN THIS IS NOT TO

WHEN WE PRESCRIBE A SET NUMBER

04:02:29.101 --> 04:02:31.536

THE BILL DOESN'T CONTEMPLATE THE

04:02:50.689 --> 04:02:53.659
DIFFERENT IMPACTS ON DIFFERENT

04:02:53.725 --> 04:02:55.727
SIZE COURT SYSTEMS DO YOU HAVE

04:02:55.794 --> 04:02:59.164

SHARE THE THE CONCERNS THAT YOU

04:03:05.237 --> 04:03:07.506
RAISE SENATOR THAT WE DO HAVE TO

04:03:07.572 --> 04:03:09.541
ADEQUATELY FUND OUR COURTS AND

04:03:09.608 --> 04:03:10.075
THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO

04:03:10.142 --> 04:03:11.977
ACCOUNT THE THE DIFFERENCES IN

04:03:12.044 --> 04:03:14.046
COUNTIES AND WE HAVE TO FIND A

04:03:14.112 --> 04:03:14.479
WAY.

04:03:14.546 --> 04:03:16.548
TO GET THROUGH THAT -- BUT IF WE

04:03:16.615 --> 04:03:17.883
IDENTIFY HOUSING IS A SERIOUS

04:03:17.950 --> 04:03:19.551
PROBLEM THEN WE HAVE TO FIGURE

04:03:19.618 --> 04:03:21.286
THAT OUT TOGETHER.

04:03:21.353 --> 04:03:22.688
THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT IN

04:03:22.754 --> 04:03:24.056

ASK THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL LEASE.

04:03:26.425 --> 04:03:29.928
UNDER THE SAME QUESTION.

04:03:29.995 --> 04:03:33.498
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT -- THE

04:03:33.565 --> 04:03:36.401
THE TIMELINE ORIGINALLY WAS A

04:03:36.468 --> 04:03:37.069
HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE DAYS IN THE

04:03:37.135 --> 04:03:38.337
COURT OF APPEAL PROPOSING TO

04:03:38.403 --> 04:03:40.339
SKIP THE TRIAL COURT STEP THAT

04:03:40.405 --> 04:03:41.707
WAS FOUND IN CONSTITUTIONAL.

04:03:41.773 --> 04:03:43.675
IN LITIGATION IN ALAMEDA COUNTY

04:03:43.742 --> 04:03:47.412
AND SO THEN WE THEN IN THE SB

04:03:47.479 --> 04:03:48.380
SEVEN FORTY THREE THAT THEM PRO

04:03:48.447 --> 04:03:49.648
TEM STEINBERG DID.

04:03:49.715 --> 04:03:50.916
THEM IT.

04:03:50.983 --> 04:03:52.317
HAD PROVISIONS SPECIFIC TO THE

04:03:52.384 --> 04:03:54.052
KINGS ARENA AND THEN HAD TO HAVE

04:03:54.119 --> 04:03:55.253
THE QUOTE FIX.

04:03:55.320 --> 04:03:58.557
AND SO THE THE THE MAGIC TWO

04:03:58.623 --> 04:03:59.458
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAYS CAME

04:03:59.524 --> 04:04:01.560
FROM THAT BILL WE THINK IT WAS

04:04:01.626 --> 04:04:03.128
DRIVEN PRIMARILY FOR THE

04:04:03.195 --> 04:04:04.563
LITIGATION THAT WAS BEING

04:04:04.629 --> 04:04:06.331
ANTICIPATED.

04:04:06.398 --> 04:04:09.668
THERE -- AND AND THE COURTS HAVE

04:04:09.735 --> 04:04:11.570
HAD DIFFICULTY IN THE TWO AB

04:04:11.636 --> 04:04:12.170
NINE HUNDRED CASES WE TALKED

04:04:12.237 --> 04:04:14.539
ABOUT EARLIER BOTH FROM VERY

04:04:14.606 --> 04:04:16.008
LARGE COUNTIES.

04:04:16.074 --> 04:04:18.510
SAN FRANCISCO AND LA -- AND I'D

04:04:18.577 --> 04:04:21.046
I DO THINK IN IN TERMS OF ONE OF

04:04:21.113 --> 04:04:23.248
THE POINTS AUTOMATE EARLIER.

04:04:23.315 --> 04:04:25.083
THAN. FOR THOSE CASE THAT WE CAN

04:04:25.150 --> 04:04:26.251
ALL DEBATE ABOUT HOW WHAT

04:04:26.318 --> 04:04:27.519
PERCENTAGE OF CASES GET FIT

04:04:27.586 --> 04:04:28.353
UNDER SEQUEL.

04:04:28.420 --> 04:04:29.588
BUT IF A PROJECT IS A

04:04:29.654 --> 04:04:31.156
CONTENTIOUS PROJECT IF THEY'RE

04:04:31.223 --> 04:04:33.458
CITING ISSUES AND NEVER VARIETY

04:04:33.525 --> 04:04:34.126
OF KINDS OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED

04:04:34.192 --> 04:04:35.594
LOCALLY.

04:04:35.660 --> 04:04:37.329
IT WILL BE HEAVILY LITIGATED --

04:04:37.396 --> 04:04:38.730
IT WOULD BE MALPRACTICE NOT TO

04:04:38.797 --> 04:04:40.332
THINK OF EVERY POSSIBLE CAUSE OF

04:04:40.399 --> 04:04:41.600
ACTION TO BRING LIKE THE TWO

04:04:41.666 --> 04:04:42.768
EXAMPLES I GAVE YOU SO

04:04:42.834 --> 04:04:44.703
REGARDLESS OF THE SIZE OF THOSE

04:04:44.770 --> 04:04:46.338
PARTICULAR PROJECTS THE REALITY.

AT ODDS WITH OUR COURT SYSTEM

EARLIER IN THIS AREA.

04:05:41.893 --> 04:05:43.628
WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE VICTIMS

04:05:43.695 --> 04:05:46.565
OF HORRIFIC.

04:05:46.631 --> 04:05:51.970
ABUSE NEGLECT CETERA -- IN SOME --

SHORT TERM MERSON TERMS OF LIFE

04:05:53.905 --> 04:05:55.874
EXPECTANCY AND TO PUSH THEM TO

04:05:55.941 --> 04:05:57.509
THE BACK ONLINE WOULD BE A

04:05:57.576 --> 04:05:59.845
SOCIAL INJUSTICE AS WELL.

FOLLOWED BY SENATOR ALLEN AND IT

04:06:06.785 --> 04:06:08.487
LOOKS LIKE CENTER OMER WOULD

04:06:08.553 --> 04:06:09.821
ALSO LIKE TO SPEAK ARTS.

04:06:09.888 --> 04:06:12.257
CENTER FOR JUST ALLEN IN THE

04:06:12.324 --> 04:06:12.757
NUMBER.

04:06:12.824 --> 04:06:14.993
I THINK WHAT WHAT HAPPENS IS.

04:06:15.060 --> 04:06:16.928
WE HEAR ARGUMENTS DEPENDING ON

04:06:16.995 --> 04:06:18.363
THE CONTEXT.

04:06:18.430 --> 04:06:21.833
THAT TALK ABOUT -- SEE COULD NOT

04:06:21.900 --> 04:06:23.969
BEING AN IMPEDIMENT TO

04:06:24.035 --> 04:06:26.037
DEVELOPMENT.

04:06:26.104 --> 04:06:29.274
DODD AND WE HAVE A REPORT FROM

04:06:29.341 --> 04:06:29.574
[inaudible]

04:06:29.641 --> 04:06:31.510
BERKELEY

04:06:31.576 --> 04:06:33.945
BE A URBAN ECONOMICS.

04:06:34.012 --> 04:06:36.815
I WE HAD A HEARING HERE.

04:06:36.882 --> 04:06:39.417
AND IT WAS PRONOUNCED THAT THE

04:06:39.484 --> 04:06:41.186
REPORT INDICATED THAT THERE WAS

04:06:41.253 --> 04:06:43.155
NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE

04:06:43.221 --> 04:06:44.723
ARGUMENT THAT SEQUEL REPRESENTS.

04:06:44.789 --> 04:06:47.592
A MAJOR BARRIER TO DEVELOPMENT.

04:06:47.659 --> 04:06:48.894
TO THE CONTRARY THE REPORT FOUND

04:06:48.960 --> 04:06:50.896
THAT ONLY ZERO POINT 7% OF ALL

04:06:50.962 --> 04:06:52.497
SECRET PROJECTS UNDERGOING

04:06:52.564 --> 04:06:54.199
ENVIRONMENTAL.

04:06:54.266 --> 04:06:54.699
REVIEW WERE INVOLVED IN

04:06:54.766 --> 04:06:56.001
LITIGATION.

04:06:56.067 --> 04:06:57.569
SO I'M TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHICH

04:06:57.636 --> 04:06:59.938
WAY DO WE HAVE IT.

04:07:00.005 --> 04:07:00.539
IT'S EITHER GOING TO CLOG THE

04:07:00.605 --> 04:07:01.439
SYSTEM.

04:07:01.506 --> 04:07:04.509
IN BE SO FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR.

04:07:04.576 --> 04:07:06.211
BUT HAVE TO ADMIT THAT SEEK WHAT

04:07:06.278 --> 04:07:08.713
IS -- AN UNDERLYING SOURCE OF

04:07:08.780 --> 04:07:10.448
LITIGATION THAT CREATES PROBLEMS

04:07:10.515 --> 04:07:11.783
IN THE HOUSING MARKET.

04:07:11.850 --> 04:07:15.554
OR THERE'S NONE OF LITIGATION --

04:07:15.620 --> 04:07:17.255
DERIVED FROM CIBOLA THAT IT'S

04:07:17.322 --> 04:07:19.991
NOT AN ISSUE IT'S ZERO POINT 7%

04:07:20.058 --> 04:07:21.693
I DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY I DON'T

04:07:21.760 --> 04:07:22.627
KNOW WHO'S RIGHT.

04:07:22.694 --> 04:07:24.196
BUT I'LL TELL YOU MY EXPERIENCE

04:07:24.262 --> 04:07:26.464
GOING BACK TO THE LOCAL LEVEL.

04:07:26.531 --> 04:07:27.632
IS THAT SYKORA.

04:07:27.699 --> 04:07:29.601
I IN ITS PROCESS IN THOSE THAT

04:07:29.668 --> 04:07:32.037
USE IT TO CHALLENGE A PROJECT

04:07:32.103 --> 04:07:32.337
[inaudible]

04:07:32.404 --> 04:07:34.839
ROUTINELY REACH AN ACCOMMODATION

04:07:34.906 --> 04:07:36.708
AND UNDERSTANDING AT SOME POINT

04:07:36.775 --> 04:07:38.877
IN THE PROCESS.

04:07:38.944 --> 04:07:39.444
WHERE BY THE LITIGATION GOES

04:07:39.511 --> 04:07:40.745
AWAY [inaudible]

04:07:40.812 --> 04:07:41.947
HAPPENS.

04:07:42.013 --> 04:07:44.649
ALL THE TIME.

04:07:44.716 --> 04:07:46.418
IN SO IF THAT IS THE CASE THAT

04:07:46.484 --> 04:07:49.788
MOST LITIGATION GOES AWAY.

04:07:49.854 --> 04:07:51.423
THAT IS DERIVED UNDERSEA QUIRK.

04:07:51.489 --> 04:07:53.391
AND THAT ZERO POINT 7% IS

04:07:53.458 --> 04:07:55.760
ACCURATE LESSON 1%.

04:07:55.827 --> 04:07:57.028
THAT WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT A

04:07:57.095 --> 04:07:59.397
SITUATION WHERE WE WON'T BE

04:07:59.464 --> 04:08:01.032
CLOGGING THE JUDICIARY.

04:08:01.099 --> 04:08:02.601
AND THAT THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE

04:08:02.667 --> 04:08:04.336
BETWEEN THE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY

04:08:04.402 --> 04:08:06.204
DAYS OR THREE YEARS IT'S GOING

04:08:06.271 --> 04:08:07.239
TO GO AWAY.

04:08:07.305 --> 04:08:09.608
SO I GUESS MY MY POINT IS WE

04:08:09.674 --> 04:08:11.042
CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS FOLKS.

04:08:11.109 --> 04:08:11.943
WELL I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS

04:08:12.010 --> 04:08:13.979
SO YOU POINT OUT IS THAT NOW YOU

04:08:14.045 --> 04:08:15.146
ARE OPENING UP.

04:08:15.213 --> 04:08:17.616
ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR

04:08:17.682 --> 04:08:19.217
THOSE KINDS OF I MEAN YOU'RE

04:08:19.284 --> 04:08:23.021
EXPANDING THE POTENTIAL SCOPE.

04:08:23.088 --> 04:08:24.789
TO INCLUDE DAD IN OF COURSE.

04:08:24.856 --> 04:08:25.890
THEN THE OTHER SIDE OF THE

04:08:25.957 --> 04:08:26.992
ARGUMENT AS WELL IF IF SEEK WAS

04:08:27.058 --> 04:08:29.828
WORKING THEN WHY BOTHER TO MAKE

04:08:29.894 --> 04:08:30.262
THESE.

04:08:30.328 --> 04:08:31.930
AMENDMENTS I WILL I WILL TELL

04:08:31.997 --> 04:08:33.431
YOU THOUGH I COULD BE WRONG BUT

04:08:33.498 --> 04:08:34.733
MY UNDERSTANDING MY

04:08:34.799 --> 04:08:36.134
UNDERSTANDING IS THE PART OF THE

04:08:36.201 --> 04:08:38.503
PROBLEM WITH OUR INABILITY. TO

04:08:38.570 --> 04:08:40.905
BUILD LOW INCOME AFFORDABLE

04:08:40.972 --> 04:08:42.407
HOUSING A PARTICULAR APARTMENT

04:08:42.474 --> 04:08:44.843
BUILDINGS HAPPENED BACK IN THE

04:08:44.909 --> 04:08:46.444
NINETEEN EIGHTIES WHEN WE TOOK

04:08:46.511 --> 04:08:47.512
AWAY THE ACCELERATED

04:08:47.579 --> 04:08:48.947
DEPRECIATION.

04:08:49.014 --> 04:08:52.884
OPPORTUNITIES I IN OUR FEDERAL

04:08:52.951 --> 04:08:53.418
TAX LAW.

04:08:53.485 --> 04:08:55.687
SO IF WE WANT TO GET MORE

04:08:55.754 --> 04:08:57.455
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

04:08:57.522 --> 04:08:59.958
SEEMS TO ME MAYBE WE'RE LOOKING

04:09:00.025 --> 04:09:02.827
IN THE WRONG PLACE -- IN IF WE

04:09:02.894 --> 04:09:04.696
COULD RENEW THAT.

04:09:04.763 --> 04:09:06.698
XCELERATED DEPRECIATION SO FOR

04:09:06.765 --> 04:09:08.833
DEVELOPERS IT WOULD PENCIL OUT

04:09:08.900 --> 04:09:09.334
FOR THEM TO BUILD MORE

04:09:09.401 --> 04:09:10.435
APARTMENTS.

04:09:10.502 --> 04:09:12.103
THAT MIGHT BE THE ANSWER MAYBE

04:09:12.170 --> 04:09:13.772
WE'RE JUST IN A WE'RE ALL OVER

04:09:13.838 --> 04:09:16.308
THE PLACE HERE POTENTIALLY.

04:09:16.374 --> 04:09:18.276
IF THAT WAS IN FACT THE PROBLEM

04:09:18.343 --> 04:09:20.211
THEN AND AND DOES TAX EXPERTS

04:09:20.278 --> 04:09:21.479
AND BUSINESS PEOPLE AND

04:09:21.546 --> 04:09:22.914
DEVELOPERS WOULD SAY YOU KNOW

04:09:22.981 --> 04:09:23.882
WHAT I YOU GIVE ME THAT

04:09:23.948 --> 04:09:26.284
ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION AGAIN.

04:09:26.351 --> 04:09:28.253
AND IT PAY IT PENCILS OUT TO

04:09:28.320 --> 04:09:30.255
BUILD I WILL BUILD SEE COULD BE

04:09:30.322 --> 04:09:31.823
DARNED AND EVERYTHING ELSE BE

04:09:31.890 --> 04:09:33.458
DARNED THAT'S WHERE I MAKE MY

04:09:33.525 --> 04:09:34.492
MONEY SO.

04:09:34.559 --> 04:09:36.061
I JUST WONDER.

04:09:36.127 --> 04:09:37.529
YOU KNOW WE'RE BANG IN THIS.

04:09:37.595 --> 04:09:39.831
THIS ISSUE AND I COULD ARGUE

04:09:39.898 --> 04:09:43.134
WITH EVERY DIFFERENT WHICH WAY --

04:09:43.201 --> 04:09:44.069
I JUST THINK THAT.

04:09:44.135 --> 04:09:45.403
THE QUESTION BECOMES WHY EVEN

04:09:45.470 --> 04:09:47.205
BOTHER IF NONE OF THESE CASES

04:09:47.272 --> 04:09:49.107
AND UP IN SEEK WERE PROCEEDING

04:09:49.174 --> 04:09:50.942
SO I'M NOT SURE.

04:09:51.009 --> 04:09:51.910
WHERE WE'RE ALL GOING WITH THIS

04:09:51.976 --> 04:09:53.878
AND BUT I APPRECIATE THAT THERE

04:09:53.945 --> 04:09:55.880
ARE MANY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES

04:09:55.947 --> 04:09:57.248
AND IN POINT OF VIEW?

04:09:57.315 --> 04:09:58.750
IT JUST FINISH MY COMMENTS FROM

04:09:58.817 --> 04:10:02.754
THE FOR IT DOESN'T MATTER.

04:10:02.821 --> 04:10:03.855
IN IT'S A MATTER OF FAIRNESS.

04:10:03.922 --> 04:10:04.689
IF WE ARE DISCOURAGING

04:10:04.756 --> 04:10:08.293
DEVELOPMENT -- WE ARE REDUCING

04:10:08.360 --> 04:10:10.195
THE STOCK.

04:10:10.261 --> 04:10:12.364
AND THERE LIES THE SUPPLY AND

04:10:12.430 --> 04:10:14.866
DEMAND RATIO THAT IS PROBLEMATIC

04:10:14.933 --> 04:10:16.301
THAT IS INCREASING THE PRICES

04:10:16.368 --> 04:10:17.435
BECAUSE OF DEMAND.

04:10:17.502 --> 04:10:19.137
SO THE ISSUE SHOULD NOT

04:10:19.204 --> 04:10:21.239
NECESSARILY ONLY BE AFFORDABLE

04:10:21.306 --> 04:10:23.608
HOUSING IT SHOULD BE HOUSING

04:10:23.675 --> 04:10:25.377
THAT INCREASES THE STOCK IN

04:10:25.443 --> 04:10:27.445
DRIVES A MORE MODEST

04:10:27.512 --> 04:10:29.114
APPRECIATION VALUE.

04:10:29.180 --> 04:10:30.181
THAT ALLOWS FOR MORE

04:10:30.248 --> 04:10:31.616
AFFORDABILITY.

04:10:31.683 --> 04:10:33.051
I THINK A LOT OF ECONOMISTS

04:10:33.118 --> 04:10:35.820
WOULD APPRECIATE THAT.

04:10:35.887 --> 04:10:39.391
UNDER STEAK YOU SENATOR ALLEN.

04:10:39.457 --> 04:10:41.393
THE BY THE DOCKET -- I I I HEAR

04:10:41.459 --> 04:10:42.060
SO MANY CONFLICTING THINGS ABOUT

04:10:42.127 --> 04:10:42.560
THIS BECAUSE I I IT'S MY

04:10:42.627 --> 04:10:44.529
UNDERSTANDING THAT IN LARGER

04:10:44.596 --> 04:10:46.865
COURTS THERE IS A A JUDGE SHE

04:10:46.931 --> 04:10:49.467
WAS DESIGNATED TO TAKE THE

04:10:49.534 --> 04:10:50.668
SECRET CASES.

04:10:50.735 --> 04:10:52.837
SO I'M TO SOME EXTENT DOES NOT

04:10:52.904 --> 04:10:54.539
MITIGATE -- ND GIVE IT TO THE

04:10:54.606 --> 04:10:56.241
SOUTH TO BOTH OF PROPONENTS AND

04:10:56.307 --> 04:10:57.208
OPPONENTS DOES NOT MITIGATE.

04:10:57.275 --> 04:11:00.512
THE ISSUE A BET.

04:11:00.578 --> 04:11:02.414
IF YOU LIKE TO ANSWER.

04:11:02.480 --> 04:11:04.349
I'M COUNTY SERVER TWO HUNDRED

04:11:04.416 --> 04:11:05.383
THOUSAND OR MORE POPULATION HAVE

04:11:05.450 --> 04:11:06.684
TO HAVE ONE OR MORE SPECIALLY

04:11:06.751 --> 04:11:08.520
TRAINED JUDGES TO BE ABLE TO

04:11:08.586 --> 04:11:10.088
HANDLE BANQUET CASES.

04:11:10.155 --> 04:11:11.089
AND THEY DO AND THEY ALREADY

04:11:11.156 --> 04:11:12.457
HAVE CALENDAR PREFERENCE AT THE

04:11:12.524 --> 04:11:13.925
TRIAL APPELLATE LEVEL IT'S THE

04:11:13.992 --> 04:11:15.760
ARBITRARY TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY

04:11:15.827 --> 04:11:16.861
DAY REQUIREMENT THAT REQUIRES

04:11:16.928 --> 04:11:17.996
ADDITIONAL.

04:11:18.062 --> 04:11:19.431
RESOURCES BOTH IN TERMS OF HOW

04:11:19.497 --> 04:11:20.932
MUCH TIME THAT JUDGES SPENDING

04:11:20.999 --> 04:11:22.300
ON THAT PARTICULAR CASE THE

04:11:22.367 --> 04:11:23.835
STAFF SUPPORT THE ATTORNEYS AND

04:11:23.902 --> 04:11:26.538
SO FORTH AND IT MEANS THAT EVERY

04:11:26.604 --> 04:11:27.372
OTHER CASE ON THOSE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; --&lt;/c&gt;</u>

04:11:27.439 --> 04:11:29.707
JUDGES DOCKETS TAKE LONGER TO

04:11:29.774 --> 04:11:31.676
DECIDE WHAT IS YOUR QUESTION --

04:11:31.743 --> 04:11:33.912
WOULD WOULD YOU FEEL BETTER AND

04:11:33.978 --> 04:11:35.847
I'M NOT NEGOTIATING FOR THE DICE

04:11:35.914 --> 04:11:37.315
AT ALL I'M JUST DURING OUT A

04:11:37.382 --> 04:11:38.149
HYPOTHETICAL QUESTIONS GET

04:11:38.216 --> 04:11:38.616
UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR

04:11:38.683 --> 04:11:39.451
PERSPECTIVE.

04:11:39.517 --> 04:11:41.586
WOULD YOU FEEL BETTER IF IT WERE

04:11:41.653 --> 04:11:43.822
THREE SIXTY FIVE DAYS OR IS IT

04:11:43.888 --> 04:11:47.692
EASY.

04:11:47.759 --> 04:11:48.993
I MEAN I I KNOW YOU SO.

04:11:49.060 --> 04:11:49.794
IT IS THE ISSUE THE LENGTH OF

04:11:49.861 --> 04:11:50.662
TIME OR IS IT THE ISSUE OF ANY

04:11:50.728 --> 04:11:51.963
KIND OF PRIORITIZATION.

04:11:52.030 --> 04:11:53.064
THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL HAS A LONG

04:11:53.131 --> 04:11:54.265
HISTORY OF OPPOSITION THE

04:11:54.332 --> 04:11:56.067
CALENDAR PREFERENCES FOR ALL THE

04:11:56.134 --> 04:11:57.368
REASONS THAT I ALLUDED TO

04:11:57.435 --> 04:11:58.236
EARLIER.

04:11:58.303 --> 04:11:59.938
IT IS PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC

04:12:00.004 --> 04:12:01.306
WITH THE TIME LINE THAT HAS BEEN

04:12:01.372 --> 04:12:03.575
CHOSEN IN THESE INDIVIDUAL CASES

04:12:03.641 --> 04:12:04.342
BUT WE WOULD HAVE THE SAME

04:12:04.409 --> 04:12:06.578
OBJECTIONS IF YOU ADDED ANOTHER

04:12:06.644 --> 04:12:07.345
HUNDRED DAYS FRANKLY BECAUSE

04:12:07.412 --> 04:12:08.813
EVERY CASE IS DIFFERENT.

04:12:08.880 --> 04:12:11.182
THE COMPLEXITY OF THE RECORD OF

04:12:11.249 --> 04:12:12.650
THE LAW THAT HAS TO BE APPLIED

04:12:12.717 --> 04:12:14.252
IN THAT INDIVIDUAL CASE.

04:12:14.319 --> 04:12:15.520
THE COURTS MOVE QUITE QUICKLY IN

04:12:15.587 --> 04:12:16.554
IN IN THE LAST HEARING THAT WE

04:12:16.621 --> 04:12:18.823
HAD ON THIS I I DID TESTIFY

04:12:18.890 --> 04:12:19.958
THERE ARE THINGS THAT COULD

04:12:20.024 --> 04:12:20.225
SPEED UP.

04:12:20.291 --> 04:12:21.292
THE QUALIFICATION.

04:12:21.359 --> 04:12:22.760
THE IGGEST AREA OF DELAY IN

04:12:22.827 --> 04:12:24.462
SEQUOIA IS THE FIGHTS OVER THE

04:12:24.529 --> 04:12:25.864
PREPARATION AND CERTIFICATION

04:12:25.930 --> 04:12:26.531
RECORD.

04:12:26.598 --> 04:12:27.532
AND THERE ARE WAYS TO ADDRESS

04:12:27.599 --> 04:12:28.833
THAT THAT'S MAYBE FOR DIFFERENT

04:12:28.900 --> 04:12:30.368
HEARING TODAY BUT WE HAVE

04:12:30.435 --> 04:12:32.504
OFFERED PROACTIVE IDEAS ABOUT

04:12:32.570 --> 04:12:34.272
WAYS TO ACTUALLY STREAMLINED IN

04:12:34.339 --> 04:12:36.074
A FUNDAMENTAL WAY. TO MOVE THESE

04:12:36.140 --> 04:12:38.710
CASES ALONG BUT FOR WHATEVER

04:12:38.776 --> 04:12:39.377
REASON THAT'S NOT AND BY THE WAY

04:12:39.444 --> 04:12:39.777
IF YOU TAKE IT.

04:12:39.844 --> 04:12:41.045
IF THE IF THE BILL GETS ON THE

04:12:41.112 --> 04:12:42.247
AUTHOR HAS TROUBLE MOVING

04:12:42.313 --> 04:12:43.615
FORWARD I MEAN THAT MIGHT BE A

04:12:43.681 --> 04:12:44.315
CONVERSATION YOU OUGHT TO HAVE

04:12:44.382 --> 04:12:44.883
TOGETHER.

04:12:44.949 --> 04:12:46.851
SO THE SO BUT WHAT WILL HAVE YOU

04:12:46.918 --> 04:12:49.387
CLOSED BUT I WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO

04:12:49.454 --> 04:12:50.922
IS I COULD GIVE YOU SINCE THE

04:12:50.989 --> 04:12:52.357
QUESTION THAT I WAS.

04:12:52.423 --> 04:12:53.291
A YOU COULD DO THIS PERSPECTIVE

04:12:53.358 --> 04:12:59.564
ON THAT OKAY BUT LET HIM DO IT

04:12:59.631 --> 04:13:03.401
NEWS CLOSE -- THE THE UNLESS

04:13:03.468 --> 04:13:05.203
SENATOR UMBERG DID YOU HAVE A

04:13:05.270 --> 04:13:05.837
COMMENT TO KNOW YOU'RE OKAY BYE

04:13:05.904 --> 04:13:06.404
TO WOULD YOU INCLUDE THAT IN

04:13:06.471 --> 04:13:07.105
YOUR CLOTHES WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO.

TO HOLD OFF ON THE ON A VOTE.

04:13:13.545 --> 04:13:15.046
SO THAT SENATOR ALLEN CAN

04:13:15.113 --> 04:13:16.881
DISCUSS WITH YOU THAT OTHER

04:13:16.948 --> 04:13:20.018
ISSUE -- AND THEN WE WILL ONCE

04:13:20.084 --> 04:13:20.985
YOU'VE HAD OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE

04:13:21.052 --> 04:13:22.754
THAT DISCUSSION WE WILL THEN

04:13:22.820 --> 04:13:23.388
TAKE A VOTE.

04:13:23.454 --> 04:13:26.024
SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THIS

04:13:26.090 --> 04:13:27.392
ISSUE IF YOU'D LIKE TO ADDRESS

04:13:27.458 --> 04:13:28.826
ANY OTHER ISSUE.

04:13:28.893 --> 04:13:30.361
THE FLOOR IS YOURS FOR YOUR

04:13:30.428 --> 04:13:31.596
CLOTHES ALL RIGHT THERE THANK

04:13:31.663 --> 04:13:33.031
YOU JERRY JACKSON AND MEMBERS

04:13:33.097 --> 04:13:36.200
FOR THE THOROUGH DISCUSSION

04:13:36.267 --> 04:13:37.835
ABOUT THIS ISSUE TODAY AND I

04:13:37.902 --> 04:13:38.836
SAID SHE WAS SUCH A LONG DOCKET

04:13:38.903 --> 04:13:40.405
THAT YOU HAVE AND AND THE LONG

04:13:40.471 --> 04:13:41.973
DAVE ALREADY HAD SO.

04:13:42.040 --> 04:13:43.474
LET ME TRYTO SUMMARIZE FIRST BY

04:13:43.541 --> 04:13:44.876
ADDRESSING SENATOR ALLEN'S

04:13:44.943 --> 04:13:45.743
QUESTION THAT I THINK THE ANSWER

04:13:45.810 --> 04:13:46.511
IS.

04:13:46.578 --> 04:13:47.779
YES THERE IS SOME LEVEL OF

04:13:47.845 --> 04:13:48.880
MEDICATION BASED ON THAT

04:13:48.947 --> 04:13:50.148
REQUIREMENT IN TERMS OF THE

04:13:50.214 --> 04:13:51.349
EXPERTISE OF THE JUDGES IN THE

04:13:51.416 --> 04:13:53.051
LARGER POPULATION AREAS THEY

04:13:53.117 --> 04:13:53.851
HAVE.

04:13:53.918 --> 04:13:56.054
EXPERTISE THAT CAN HELP APPLIED.

04:13:56.120 --> 04:13:57.689
TO THEMSELVES OF THOSE CASES BUT

04:13:57.755 --> 04:13:59.624
THE ESSENCE OF IT IS THE TWO

04:13:59.691 --> 04:14:00.425
HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS.

04:14:00.491 --> 04:14:02.327
AND IT'S WITH THE CHAIR REALLY

04:14:02.393 --> 04:14:03.661
RAISED EARLIER IS THAT.

04:14:03.728 --> 04:14:05.196
A HER SUGGESTION ABOUT WHAT SHE

04:14:05.263 --> 04:14:07.098
SAW AS SOMEHOW MAYBE A BETTER

04:14:07.165 --> 04:14:09.867
RESOLUTION ANOTHER RESOLUTION TO

04:14:09.934 --> 04:14:19.010
IT -- IS THAT -- WE NEED TO FIND --

04:14:19.077 --> 04:14:20.511
IT AT THE END OF THE DAY FOR A

04:14:20.578 --> 04:14:21.879
PRIVATE DEVELOPER WHO'S PUTTING

04:14:21.946 --> 04:14:23.181
THEIR MONEY INTO THE PROJECT

04:14:23.247 --> 04:14:24.649
THEY HAVE TO MAKE THEIR OWN

04:14:24.716 --> 04:14:26.317
CALCULATION OF RISK REWARD.

04:14:26.384 --> 04:14:27.352
AND WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE THEY

04:14:27.418 --> 04:14:28.453
GET SUBSIDIES OR OTHER

04:14:28.519 --> 04:14:30.188
INCENTIVES OUT THERE THAT GOES

04:14:30.254 --> 04:14:31.889
INTO THAT CALCULATION OR THE

04:14:31.956 --> 04:14:33.558
WORRY THAT IF THE PROJECTS

04:14:33.625 --> 04:14:34.692
CHALLENGED BY A NEIGHBOR WHO

04:14:34.759 --> 04:14:35.893
JUST DOESN'T LIKE IT.

04:14:35.960 --> 04:14:37.261
OR SOMEBODY ELSE FOR SOME OTHER

04:14:37.328 --> 04:14:38.830
SELF INTEREST THAT IT GETS

04:14:38.896 --> 04:14:40.598
LOCKED UP IN A COURT SYSTEM THAT

04:14:40.665 --> 04:14:42.233
HAS NO END TO IT.

04:14:42.300 --> 04:14:43.935
AND THAT CARRYING COSTS X. X.

04:14:44.002 --> 04:14:45.236
CETERA GOES INTO THEIR RISK

04:14:45.303 --> 04:14:46.471
CALCULATION IS SAYS IT'S NOT

04:14:46.537 --> 04:14:47.705
WORTH DOING.

04:14:47.772 --> 04:14:49.140
IT'S JUST NOT WORTH TAKING THE

04:14:49.207 --> 04:14:50.908
CHANCE AND PUTTING OUR CAPITAL --

04:14:50.975 --> 04:14:52.443
BECAUSE WE CAN'T REALLY SEE HOW

04:14:52.510 --> 04:14:54.212
WE CAN GET THROUGH IT -- SO

04:14:54.278 --> 04:14:55.613
THERE'S LOTS OF CALCULATIONS OF

04:14:55.680 --> 04:14:58.182
THE PRIVATE SECTOR MAKES WHEN

04:14:58.249 --> 04:14:59.517
THEY MAKE THESE CHOICES.

04:14:59.584 --> 04:15:00.952
THIS BILL TRIES TO ADDRESS IN A

04:15:01.019 --> 04:15:03.021
NARROW WAY ONE OF THE MEN WHICH

04:15:03.087 --> 04:15:04.956
I'VE HEARD A GREAT DEAL ABOUT --

04:15:05.023 --> 04:15:06.090
WHICH IS THE UNCERTAINTY OF A

04:15:06.157 --> 04:15:08.359
RESOLUTION OF A SEQUEL CASE WERE

04:15:08.426 --> 04:15:09.093
IT TO BE.

04:15:09.160 --> 04:15:10.762
CHALLENGED OKAY.

04:15:10.828 --> 04:15:12.730
AND AND THAT'S WHAT THE BILL'S

04:15:12.797 --> 04:15:14.532
BEEN WRITTEN THIS WAY I'LL NOTE

04:15:14.599 --> 04:15:15.833
IN MY CLOTHES NOW THAT.

04:15:15.900 --> 04:15:17.435
THAT THROUGH THAT YOUR GOOD WORK

04:15:17.502 --> 04:15:18.870
IN YOUR COMMITTEE THAT WERE

04:15:18.936 --> 04:15:20.638
COMMITTED TO NOT ONLY LIMITING

04:15:20.705 --> 04:15:22.173
THE SIZE OF THE PROJECTS TO LESS

04:15:22.240 --> 04:15:23.708
THAN TWO HUNDRED UNITS.

04:15:23.775 --> 04:15:25.009
BUT SETTING THE HIGHER STERN VIA

04:15:25.076 --> 04:15:26.611
MENTAL STANDARDS MORE THAN EVEN

04:15:26.678 --> 04:15:27.745
REQUIRED UNDER THE THOROUGH

04:15:27.812 --> 04:15:29.947
SEQUEL PROCESS THAT GOES ON IN

04:15:30.014 --> 04:15:30.448
THE JUDGMENTS THAT LOCAL

04:15:30.515 --> 04:15:31.683
GOVERNMENTS MAKE.

04:15:31.749 --> 04:15:32.583
ABOUT WHETHER PROJECTS EVEN

04:15:32.650 --> 04:15:34.118
WORTHY OF GOING FORWARD AND

04:15:34.185 --> 04:15:35.653
WHETHER THAT ENVIRONMENTAL

04:15:35.720 --> 04:15:37.588
DOCUMENTS EVEN WORTHY OF BEING

04:15:37.655 --> 04:15:38.022
APPROVED [inaudible]

04:15:38.089 --> 04:15:39.891
SO.

04:15:39.957 --> 04:15:41.592
ED AND ENDED THE EXTENT THAT

04:15:41.659 --> 04:15:42.593
THERE'S A CONCERN ABOUT THE

04:15:42.660 --> 04:15:44.262
COURT SYSTEM I AS I SAID EARLIER

04:15:44.328 --> 04:15:45.697
WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO FUND

04:15:45.763 --> 04:15:47.298
OUR COURT SYSTEMS TO MAKE SURE

04:15:47.365 --> 04:15:48.766
THAT THE CASES IN WHICH THE

04:15:48.833 --> 04:15:50.134
CHAIR AND OTHERS HAVE RAISED ARE

04:15:50.201 --> 04:15:50.802
RESOLVED.

04:15:50.868 --> 04:15:52.570
IT'S REALLY OUR PROBLEM AND WE

04:15:52.637 --> 04:15:54.038
WE HAVE THE POWER TO RESOLVE IT

04:15:54.105 --> 04:15:55.006
WE DO.

04:15:55.073 --> 04:15:57.241
IT THAT'S THE HEART OF OF OF

04:15:57.308 --> 04:15:58.876
FUNCTIONING COURT SYSTEM OF FAIR

04:15:58.943 --> 04:16:00.011
COURT SYSTEM.

04:16:00.078 --> 04:16:01.779
AT AND REGARD IT TO WHAT WE NEED

04:16:01.846 --> 04:16:02.880
TO DO TO RESOLVE OUR HOUSING

04:16:02.947 --> 04:16:04.582
CRISIS WHICH WE ALL CLAIMS

04:16:04.649 --> 04:16:06.718
SOMETHING WE WANT.

04:16:06.784 --> 04:16:08.186
TO COMMITTED TO DOING -- AND

04:16:08.252 --> 04:16:09.787
FINALLY I NOTE THAT THIS DOESN'T

04:16:09.854 --> 04:16:10.588
CHANGE SEQUEL.

04:16:10.655 --> 04:16:11.789
ALL THE REQUIREMENTS ALL THE

04:16:11.856 --> 04:16:13.124
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS THAT ARE

04:16:13.191 --> 04:16:14.325
REQUIRED THE PUBLIC.

04:16:14.392 --> 04:16:16.194
REVIEW PROCESS THE HEARING

04:16:16.260 --> 04:16:18.329
PROCESS NOTED THAT GETS CHANGED --

04:16:18.396 --> 04:16:19.630
BY THIS BILL.

04:16:19.697 --> 04:16:22.467
AND FINALLY I DON'T WANT TO

04:16:22.533 --> 04:16:25.636
INCENTIVIZE -- THIS TYPE OF

04:16:25.703 --> 04:16:27.972
PROJECT IN HIGH FIRE ZONES I I

04:16:28.039 --> 04:16:30.341
DON'T WANT TO DO THAT -- I I

04:16:30.408 --> 04:16:31.876
DON'T REALLY SEE HOW THAT IS

04:16:31.943 --> 04:16:32.910
APPLICABLE TO WHAT WE'RE

04:16:32.977 --> 04:16:34.345
PROPOSING HERE.

04:16:34.412 --> 04:16:35.646
BUT IF THAT'S THE STANDARD WHICH

04:16:35.713 --> 04:16:38.449
I NEED TO EXPECTS SEAT TODAY. TO

TO WITHOUT EVEN UNDERSTANDING

04:16:42.587 --> 04:16:43.387
FULLY.

04:16:43.454 --> 04:16:45.089

MOBILE.

04:16:55.233 --> 04:16:57.468

EIGHTEEN IS A PREVENTION MEASURE --

04:20:24.375 --> 04:20:26.711
WE HAVE OBVIOUSLY HAD MANY

04:20:26.777 --> 04:20:28.279
DISCUSSIONS OVER THE LAST COUPLE

04:20:28.346 --> 04:20:29.347
OF YEARS ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S

04:20:29.413 --> 04:20:31.849
SIRIUS HOUSING CRISIS.

04:20:31.916 --> 04:20:33.484
AND THEY'RE ONE OF THE THINGS

04:20:33.551 --> 04:20:34.452
THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT

04:20:34.518 --> 04:20:36.921
HOUSING PRICES IS THE INCREASING

04:20:36.988 --> 04:20:38.022
HOMELESSNESS.

04:20:38.089 --> 04:20:40.891
NOW INTERESTINGLY THE DATA --

04:20:40.958 --> 04:20:43.661
ARE HOMELESS POPULATION ROSE 16%

04:20:43.728 --> 04:20:45.596
BETWEEN THE YEARS OF TWENTY

04:20:45.663 --> 04:20:47.665
FIFTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND

04:20:47.732 --> 04:20:50.234
THE ARE DIFFERENT COUNTIES AND

04:20:50.301 --> 04:20:52.803
COMMUNITIES DO -- I'LL CALL THE

04:20:52.870 --> 04:20:54.739
CENSUS BUT INDEPENDENT THE

04:20:54.805 --> 04:20:57.608
CENSUS THEY COLLECT EVERY YEAR --

04:20:57.675 --> 04:20:59.310
INFORMATION ABOUT WHO THEY'RE

04:20:59.377 --> 04:21:01.345
HOMELESS POPULATION IS AND WHAT

04:21:01.412 --> 04:21:03.247
WE'VE SEEN IS THAT THESE NEWLY

04:21:03.314 --> 04:21:05.016
HOMELESS ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE

04:21:05.082 --> 04:21:06.317
EMPLOYED.

04:21:06.384 --> 04:21:07.518
THEY'RE WORKING.

04:21:07.585 --> 04:21:10.354
THEY WERE RECENTLY HOUSED.

04:21:10.421 --> 04:21:12.523
AND THEY ARE NOT MENTALLY ILL

04:21:12.590 --> 04:21:14.925
AND THEY ARE NOT ADDICTED THESE

04:21:14.992 --> 04:21:16.560
ARE PEOPLE WHO WERE JUST. FOR

04:21:16.627 --> 04:21:18.029
EXAMPLE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS A

04:21:18.095 --> 04:21:20.097
WAY OF FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS

04:21:20.164 --> 04:21:23.467
UNEXPECTED EXPENSE AWAY FROM

04:21:23.534 --> 04:21:25.703
LOSING THEIR HOUSING BECAUSE

04:21:25.770 --> 04:21:27.238
THEY COULD THEN BE THERE GOT

04:21:27.304 --> 04:21:28.873
BEHIND IN THEIR RENTS.

04:21:28.939 --> 04:21:30.775
THEY COULD MEET PAYMENTS AND

04:21:30.841 --> 04:21:32.443
MANY OF THEM WERE NOT AFFECTED

04:21:32.510 --> 04:21:34.278
BUT THEY LEFT THEIR HOUSING TO

04:21:34.345 --> 04:21:36.247
AVOID EVICTION BECAUSE AN

04:21:36.313 --> 04:21:37.581
EVICTION ON YOUR RECORD

04:21:37.648 --> 04:21:39.950
BASICALLY CAN PREVENT YOU.

04:21:40.017 --> 04:21:41.419
FROM BEING ABLE TO RUN AGAIN.

04:21:41.485 --> 04:21:42.853
RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA OVER A

04:21:42.920 --> 04:21:46.023
QUARTER OF OUR RENTER'S.

04:21:46.090 --> 04:21:48.859
SPEND OVER HALF OF THEIR INCOME

04:21:48.926 --> 04:21:50.394
ON RENT.

04:21:50.461 --> 04:21:52.663
SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT

04:21:52.730 --> 04:21:54.565
INCREASES THE FUNDING TO THE

04:21:54.632 --> 04:21:56.100
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING

04:21:56.167 --> 04:21:58.235
AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT WHICH

04:21:58.302 --> 04:22:01.005
THEY ALREADY HAVE AN EMERGENCY

04:22:01.072 --> 04:22:02.673
RENTAL ASSISTANCE FUND.

04:22:02.740 --> 04:22:04.842
AND SO IT INCREASES THAT FUNDS

04:22:04.909 --> 04:22:07.711
TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY

04:22:07.778 --> 04:22:09.580
RENTAL ASSISTANCE TO KEEP PEOPLE

04:22:09.647 --> 04:22:11.482
HOUSED.

04:22:11.549 --> 04:22:14.418
AND IT WOULD ALSO INCREASE SOME

04:22:14.485 --> 04:22:17.054
LEGAL AID MONIES TO ASSIST.

04:22:17.121 --> 04:22:20.057
OUR PEOPLE TO IN EFFECT STAY IN

04:22:20.124 --> 04:22:23.461
THEIR HOUSING -- D. SIMILAR

04:22:23.527 --> 04:22:26.997
PROGRAM IN NEW YORK DECREASED.

04:22:27.064 --> 04:22:29.266
PEOPLE LOSING THEIR PLACES OF

04:22:29.333 --> 04:22:32.403
RESIDENCE BY A 14%.

04:22:32.470 --> 04:22:34.271
AND IN OAKLAND A PROGRAM THAT

04:22:34.338 --> 04:22:36.407
WAS ESTABLISHED JOSH LAST

04:22:36.474 --> 04:22:39.910
OCTOBER HAS ALREADY ASSISTED

04:22:39.977 --> 04:22:41.445
SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY FAMILIES.

04:22:41.512 --> 04:22:43.581
AND THE ORDER OF ASSISTANCE HAS

04:22:43.647 --> 04:22:46.317
BEEN IN THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED

04:22:46.383 --> 04:22:47.351
TO THREE THOUSAND DOLLAR RANGE.

04:22:47.418 --> 04:22:48.819
AND ALL OF THOSE FAMILIES HAVE

04:22:48.886 --> 04:22:51.188
BEEN ABLE TO RETAIN HOUSING

04:22:51.255 --> 04:22:52.990
SINCE THEIR ASSISTANCE SO WITH

04:22:53.057 --> 04:22:54.625

UP EVEN MORE BUT THE MAIN THING

04:23:20.818 --> 04:23:22.786
I WANTED TO SAY ABOUT PREVENTION

04:23:22.853 --> 04:23:24.255
IS THAT IT'S OF SMALL

04:23:24.321 --> 04:23:25.589
INTERVENTION THAT'S THE MOST

04:23:25.656 --> 04:23:27.224
HUMANE.

04:23:27.291 --> 04:23:28.926
AND THE MOST EFFECTIVE.

04:23:28.993 --> 04:23:30.427
ENDING HOMELESSNESS BEFORE IT

04:23:30.494 --> 04:23:33.764

AND FIFTY HOUSEHOLDS.

04:23:57.021 --> 04:23:58.656
WHICH OF COURSE IS THREE THAT

04:23:58.722 --> 04:24:00.925
MEANS USUALLY THE AVERAGE

04:24:00.991 --> 04:24:02.393

AND TO BUILD A HOUSING WITH

04:24:09.266 --> 04:24:11.168
THOSE SAME AMOUNT OF DOLLARS WE

WOULD ONLY HOUSE A HUNDRED FIFTY

04:24:12.970 --> 04:24:15.406
FAMILIES SO IT'S JUST THE MOST

04:24:15.472 --> 04:24:17.241
REASONABLE AND EFFECTIVE.

04:24:17.308 --> 04:24:21.312

VERY IMPORTANT JURY REFORM.

04:32:54.624 --> 04:32:57.661
CALIFORNIA LAW GUARANTEES.

04:32:57.728 --> 04:32:58.962
EACH OF US THE RIGHT TO A JURY

04:32:59.029 --> 04:33:00.764
OF OUR PEERS.

04:33:00.831 --> 04:33:02.966
BUT IN PRACTICE WE HAVE LAWS ON

04:33:03.033 --> 04:33:04.301
THE BOOKS THAT HAVE SHRUNK THE

04:33:04.367 --> 04:33:06.369
JURY POOL.

04:33:06.436 --> 04:33:09.139
AND HAVE -- STOPPED OUR JURIES

04:33:09.206 --> 04:33:11.007
FROM BEING REPRESENTATIVE AND

04:33:11.074 --> 04:33:12.743
ONE OF THOSE LAWS IS THAT PEOPLE

04:33:12.809 --> 04:33:15.245
WITH A PRIOR FELONY CONVICTION

04:33:15.312 --> 04:33:16.747
ARE PERMANENTLY.

04:33:16.813 --> 04:33:18.682
ELIMINATED FROM BEING ABLE TO

04:33:18.749 --> 04:33:19.916
SERVE ON A JURY.

04:33:19.983 --> 04:33:21.585
NOW WHAT DOES THAT DO.

04:33:21.651 --> 04:33:24.254
IN CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE.

04:33:24.321 --> 04:33:26.656
ABOUT ONE THIRD OF AFRICAN

04:33:26.723 --> 04:33:28.925
AMERICAN MEN WHO ARE RESIDING

04:33:28.992 --> 04:33:31.561
CALIFORNIA ARE NW PREVENTED

04:33:31.628 --> 04:33:33.663
FROM SERVING ON A JURY.

04:33:33.730 --> 04:33:35.165
AND YOU CAN GET A FELONY FROM

04:33:35.232 --> 04:33:36.566
SUCH THINGS.

04:33:36.633 --> 04:33:41.338
NOT TO TO MINIMIZE BUT GRAFFITI.

04:33:41.404 --> 04:33:42.739
OR DRUG OFFENSE.

04:33:42.806 --> 04:33:44.207
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF FELONIES

04:33:44.274 --> 04:33:46.476
WHICH I THINK FOR MOST OF US.

04:33:46.543 --> 04:33:49.312
IF WE LOOK AT A PERSON WHO HAS

04:33:49.379 --> 04:33:50.947
SERVED THEIR TIME.

04:33:51.014 --> 04:33:52.682
AND IS FUNCTIONING IN OUR

04:33:52.749 --> 04:33:54.351
COMMUNITIES IS THRIVING IN OUR

04:33:54.417 --> 04:33:55.786
COMMUNITY.

04:33:55.852 --> 04:33:57.287
WHY WE WOULD?

04:33:57.354 --> 04:33:59.055
ELIMINATE THEIR ABILITY TO SERVE

04:33:59.122 --> 04:34:00.857
ON A JURY WE'VE RESTORED THEIR

04:34:00.924 --> 04:34:03.827
VOTING RIGHTS -- BUT YET WE

04:34:03.894 --> 04:34:05.529
ELIMINATE THEIR ABILITY TO SERVE

04:34:05.595 --> 04:34:06.496
ON A JURY.

04:34:06.563 --> 04:34:09.032
SO BASICALLY WHAT SB THREE TEN

04:34:09.099 --> 04:34:11.568
DOES IS REVERSE THAT AND ALLOW

04:34:11.635 --> 04:34:13.737
PEOPLE WITH WHO WERE OFF OF

04:34:13.804 --> 04:34:15.305
PROBATION AND HAVE.

04:34:15.372 --> 04:34:17.140
A FORMER FELONY CONVICTION TO

04:34:17.207 --> 04:34:19.676
SERVE ON A JURY IT ALSO EXPANDS

04:34:19.743 --> 04:34:22.412
THE LIST THAT A COURT USES TO BE

04:34:22.479 --> 04:34:24.881
ABLE TO SELECT JURORS BECAUSE IT

04:34:24.948 --> 04:34:27.818
PRIOR WAS VERY LIMITED -- IN.

04:34:27.884 --> 04:34:29.352
A FINAL THING I WOULD SAY IS

04:34:29.419 --> 04:34:30.487
THAT.

04:34:30.554 --> 04:34:32.155
WE WOULD NOT BE THE FIRST STATE

04:34:32.222 --> 04:34:33.590
TO DO THIS WHATSOEVER WERE

04:34:33.657 --> 04:34:34.891
BEHIND.

04:34:34.958 --> 04:34:37.561
COLORADO ILLINOIS MAINE OREGON

04:34:37.627 --> 04:34:39.930
FOR EXAMPLE OTHER STATES HAVE A

04:34:39.996 --> 04:34:42.365
ALLOW DO YOU ALLOW PEOPLE WITH

04:34:42.432 --> 04:34:44.201
FORMER FELONY CONVICTIONS TO

04:34:44.267 --> 04:34:46.236
SERVE AND WITHOUT I WOULD LIKE.

EMBRACED ME BACK INTO THE

OUT OF PROCESSES.

04:35:56.606 --> 04:35:58.241
THAT ARE FUNDED FUNDAMENTAL TO

04:35:58.308 --> 04:35:59.342
WHAT IT MEANS TO BE CLASSIFIED

AS A CITIZEN.

04:36:00.510 --> 04:36:01.745
IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT RESEARCH

04:36:01.811 --> 04:36:03.513
DEMONSTRATES THAT JURY DIVERSITY

04:36:03.580 --> 04:36:05.215
INCREASES THE OVERALL QUALITY OF

04:36:05.282 --> 04:36:06.549
DELIBERATIONS.

04:36:06.616 --> 04:36:07.851

EDUCATED REACH OF THE JURY

04:36:13.290 --> 04:36:14.357
POSSIBLY PROMOTING THE

SUBSEQUENT INCREASE IN THE RATE

04:36:15.792 --> 04:36:17.861
AT WHICH FORMER JURORS TAKE PART

04:36:17.928 --> 04:36:19.229
IN POLITICAL PROCESSES.

04:36:19.296 --> 04:36:20.931
DIVERSITY OF SERVICE ALSO

04:36:20.997 --> 04:36:22.432
LEGITIMIZES JURY VERDICTS

04:36:22.499 --> 04:36:23.967
ESPECIALLY FOR TRADITIONALLY

04:36:24.034 --> 04:36:25.368

THIS IS GOOD IN EVERY PROCESS

04:36:37.047 --> 04:36:38.114
AND NOT ROOTED IN RESEARCH AND

04:36:38.181 --> 04:36:39.449
EVIDENCE AND BUILD A PRIOR

04:36:39.516 --> 04:36:40.917
FELONY CONVICTIONS POSE LITTLE

04:36:40.984 --> 04:36:42.585
HARM TO SERVING ON THE JURY.

04:36:42.652 --> 04:36:44.020
THE VALUE OF X. INCLUSION WILL

04:36:44.087 --> 04:36:45.622

EXCEPT THOSE INCARCERATED AT THE

04:41:15.792 --> 04:41:18.294
TIME OF THEIR JURY SERVICE WOULD

04:41:18.361 --> 04:41:20.563
BE ELIGIBLE TO SERVE ON A JURY.

04:41:20.630 --> 04:41:21.931

BE ABLE TO INQUIRE AS TO WHETHER

04:41:52.629 --> 04:41:54.931
SUCH BIASES EXIST WILL IT HAPPEN

04:41:54.998 --> 04:41:56.599
IN OPEN COURT IN WHICH PERSONS

04:41:56.666 --> 04:41:58.368

04:41:58.434 --> 04:41:59.936

SUPERVISED RELEASE.

04:42:11.080 --> 04:42:12.515
IS ALSO NOT HARD TO IMAGINE THAT

04:42:12.582 --> 04:42:14.450
SOME JURORS WILL BE SERIOUSLY

04:42:14.517 --> 04:42:15.852

THAT REASON.

04:42:28.398 --> 04:42:29.932

04:44:20.710 --> 04:44:21.978
THE BROTHER OF A CONVICTED FELON

04:44:22.044 --> 04:44:23.479
IS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN A

04:44:23.546 --> 04:44:24.981
CONVICTED FELON WHO IS SITTING

04:44:25.047 --> 04:44:26.048
ON A JURY YOU'RE ASKING A PHONE

04:44:26.115 --> 04:44:27.583
FIRST TO DISCLOSE.

04:44:27.650 --> 04:44:29.752
IN OPEN COURT THAT HE OR SHE HAS

04:44:29.819 --> 04:44:32.321
BEEN CONVICTED OF A FELONY AND

04:44:32.388 --> 04:44:34.424
IT MAY LEAD TO QUESTIONS THAT

04:44:34.490 --> 04:44:36.225
ARE ICREDIBLY INTRUSIVE FOR

04:44:36.292 --> 04:44:38.594
THAT -- PERSPECTIVE JURORS WELL

04:44:38.661 --> 04:44:40.930

WHATEVER THOSE CRIMES MAYBE AND

04:44:44.767 --> 04:44:46.602
THESE PEOPLE MAY STILL BE ON

04:44:46.669 --> 04:44:48.504
PAROLE OR PROBATION.

04:44:48.571 --> 04:44:49.772

THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF

04:44:53.142 --> 04:44:54.444
POTENTIALLY VERY SENSITIVE

04:44:54.510 --> 04:44:56.479
QUESTIONS THAT THAT COULD COULD

04:44:56.546 --> 04:44:57.246
BE ASKED IN THE COULD CAUSE

04:44:57.313 --> 04:45:00.082
TROUBLE. FOR THE PERSON BEING

04:45:00.149 --> 04:45:00.983

04:45:03.619 --> 04:45:05.621
YOU KNOW THEY DIDN'T SHOW UP

TRIAL.

04:49:29.752 --> 04:49:30.920
IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY

04:49:30.986 --> 04:49:31.854
OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T WANT TO

04:49:31.921 --> 04:49:34.090
DISCLOSE INFORMATION ABOUT

04:49:34.156 --> 04:49:35.591
THEMSELVES PUBLIC.

04:49:35.658 --> 04:49:36.792
OCCUR.

04:49:36.859 --> 04:49:38.661
OKAY SO TWO DIFFERENT OKAY VERY

04:49:38.728 --> 04:49:40.796
GOOD -- SENATOR BORCHERS YOU

04:49:40.863 --> 04:49:41.997
MENTIONED THAT THERE WERE TWO

04:49:42.064 --> 04:49:46.969
WAYS THAT -- THE JURY ROLES ARE --

04:49:47.036 --> 04:49:48.671
ARE ARE MADE.

04:49:48.738 --> 04:49:50.072
ARE MADE FROM THE LIST BUT THERE

04:49:50.139 --> 04:49:52.108
IS A THIRD THAT OTHERS USE

04:49:52.174 --> 04:49:53.576
WHAT'S THAT THIRD.

04:49:53.642 --> 04:49:55.111
THERE'S A LOT TO OTHER OF LIST

04:49:55.177 --> 04:49:57.613
THIS LEGISLATION IS PROPOSING

04:49:57.680 --> 04:50:00.416
ADDING TAX FILING -- A UTILITY

04:50:00.483 --> 04:50:03.586
LISTS -- AND AND THE STANDARD

04:50:03.652 --> 04:50:05.054
VOTER REGISTRATION AND DIVINE

04:50:05.121 --> 04:50:06.188
MOTOR VEHICLES.

04:50:06.255 --> 04:50:07.923
NUMBER OF STATES USE OTHER KINDS

04:50:07.990 --> 04:50:10.493
OFLIST ALASKA WHICH HAS THE THE

04:50:10.559 --> 04:50:12.561
MOST COOPERATIVE JURY POOL USES

04:50:12.628 --> 04:50:15.798
THEIR REWARD OF THE MONEY FOR

04:50:15.865 --> 04:50:17.600
ALL CITIZENS LIST.

04:50:17.666 --> 04:50:19.268
AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE HAPPEN TO

04:50:19.335 --> 04:50:20.903
BE SUMMONED IS STILL A SERVER IS

04:50:20.970 --> 04:50:21.937
ON THAT LIST BECAUSE THEY WANT

04:50:22.004 --> 04:50:29.612
TO BE BUT BUT A NUMBER OF STATES

04:50:29.678 --> 04:50:30.045
ARE USING.

04:50:30.112 --> 04:50:32.181
A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT LISTS.

04:50:32.248 --> 04:50:32.982
ENTER AN ARC ARC OUR STATE HAS

04:50:33.048 --> 04:50:33.415
ALLOWED FOR THAT.

04:50:33.482 --> 04:50:34.016
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE'S

04:50:34.083 --> 04:50:34.650
ALWAYS BEEN A PRESUMPTION THAT

04:50:34.717 --> 04:50:35.851
THOSE TWO LISTS DEPARTMENT MOTOR

04:50:35.918 --> 04:50:37.353
VEHICLE AND VOTER REGISTRATION.

04:50:37.419 --> 04:50:39.288
ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF A CROSS

04:50:39.355 --> 04:50:40.022
SECTION.

04:50:40.089 --> 04:50:42.091
AND THAT PRESUMPTION IS WHAT

04:50:42.158 --> 04:50:44.059
WE'RE TRYING TO DO AWAY WITH IN

04:50:44.126 --> 04:50:46.896
IN THIS BILL.

04:50:46.962 --> 04:50:47.730
AB ON EXTERNAL STAND THIS.

04:50:47.797 --> 04:50:50.699
THIS THIS BILL -- NOT ONLY

04:50:50.766 --> 04:50:54.370
APPLIES TO THE THE FOLKS WHO HAD --

04:50:54.436 --> 04:50:57.139
CRIMINAL RECORD BUT THE RULES

04:50:57.206 --> 04:51:00.242
THEMSELVES WILL BE -- EXPANDED

04:51:00.309 --> 04:51:03.212
BY USING THESE OTHER LESS RIGHT.

04:51:03.279 --> 04:51:04.613
DO WE HAVE ANY REASON TO THINK

04:51:04.680 --> 04:51:06.715
THAT JUST THE LATTER.

04:51:06.782 --> 04:51:09.285
EXPANDING THE LIST WOULD GIVE US

04:51:09.351 --> 04:51:10.686
GREATER PARTICIPATION AND

04:51:10.753 --> 04:51:12.922
GREATER DIVERSITY REFLECTIVE OF

04:51:12.988 --> 04:51:16.425
THE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION -- IF

04:51:16.492 --> 04:51:17.660
ED THROUGH THE CHAIR IF I MAY

04:51:17.726 --> 04:51:19.161
ANSWER THESE.

04:51:19.228 --> 04:51:20.996
CERTAINLY EXPANDING THE LIST

04:51:21.063 --> 04:51:23.365
WILL HELP WITH A BROADER JURY

04:51:23.432 --> 04:51:25.301
POOL BUT AS I MENTIONED WITH OUR

04:51:25.367 --> 04:51:26.836
CURRENT PROHIBITION [inaudible]

04:51:26.902 --> 04:51:28.838
A THIRD.

04:51:28.904 --> 04:51:30.506
OF AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE

04:51:30.573 --> 04:51:32.641
RESIDENTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE

04:51:32.708 --> 04:51:34.543
EXCLUDED FROM JURIES.

04:51:34.610 --> 04:51:36.712
JUST WITH THE RULE THAT EXCLUDES

04:51:36.779 --> 04:51:38.514
ANY EX FELON.

04:51:38.581 --> 04:51:40.983
SO REGARDLESS OF WHAT OTHER LIST

04:51:41.050 --> 04:51:42.885
WE MIGHT ADD WE ARE STILL

04:51:42.952 --> 04:51:43.886
EXCLUDING.

04:51:43.953 --> 04:51:45.588
AT LEAST A THIRD.

04:51:45.654 --> 04:51:47.556
OF THE BLACK RESIDENT MALE

04:51:47.623 --> 04:51:50.759
RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA.

04:51:50.826 --> 04:51:54.096
UNLESS WE ACT ON THIS -- THANK

04:51:54.163 --> 04:51:58.100
YOU FOR OF SENATOR UMBERG.

04:51:58.167 --> 04:51:59.835
THANK YOU MANAGER A COUPLE OF

04:51:59.902 --> 04:52:04.306
ISSUES ONE IS -- OR COMMENTS --

04:52:04.373 --> 04:52:05.341
ONE WE DO ONE X. BEEN THE JURY

04:52:05.407 --> 04:52:07.810
POOL OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

04:52:07.877 --> 04:52:09.078
FOR EXPLORING THAT WITH ALL OF

04:52:09.144 --> 04:52:11.247
US SECONDLY OF I'VE SPENT A LOT

04:52:11.313 --> 04:52:12.248
OF MY CAREER.

04:52:12.314 --> 04:52:14.550
TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE ON JURIES

04:52:14.617 --> 04:52:15.951
OR TRIED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

04:52:16.018 --> 04:52:17.052
EXPAND OF THE POOL

04:52:17.119 --> 04:52:19.054
CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU TO WANT

04:52:19.121 --> 04:52:20.289
TO ACTUALLY.

04:52:20.356 --> 04:52:22.324
SERVE AND THEN ADVOCATING ON

04:52:22.391 --> 04:52:23.859
BEHALF OF OTHERS THAT THAT YOU

04:52:23.926 --> 04:52:25.060
WANT.

04:52:25.127 --> 04:52:27.630
TO INCREASE THE JURY POOL -- I

04:52:27.696 --> 04:52:29.431
ALSO BELIEVE THAT ONCE SOMEONE

04:52:29.498 --> 04:52:30.399
IS COMPLETELY -- SENDS THEIR

04:52:30.466 --> 04:52:32.334
FULL CIVIL RIGHTS SHOULD BE

04:52:32.401 --> 04:52:33.369
RESTORED.

04:52:33.435 --> 04:52:35.304
THE QUESTION IS IS I LOOK AT THE

04:52:35.371 --> 04:52:37.506
BILL IT SAYS THIS ONLY --

04:52:37.573 --> 04:52:38.807
EXCLUDES PERSONS WHEN THEY'RE

04:52:38.874 --> 04:52:40.910
INCARCERATED BUT THE SENTENCE

04:52:40.976 --> 04:52:42.311
TYPICALLY CONTINUES BEYOND

04:52:42.378 --> 04:52:43.512
INCARCERATION WHETHER IT'S

04:52:43.579 --> 04:52:45.447
SUPERVISED RELEASE PAROLE OR

04:52:45.514 --> 04:52:46.515
PROBATION.

04:52:46.582 --> 04:52:47.783
SO SOMEONE'S ON SUPERVISED

04:52:47.850 --> 04:52:50.319
RELEASE WOULD THEY BE ELIGIBLE

04:52:50.386 --> 04:52:52.254
TO SERVE ON IT ON THE JURY.

04:52:52.321 --> 04:52:53.822
YES A CITY UNDER THIS BILL YES

04:52:53.889 --> 04:52:55.958
OKAY.

04:52:56.025 --> 04:52:59.194
I DO HAVE A CONCERN THAT SOMEONE

04:52:59.261 --> 04:53:00.696
HASN'T COMPLETED THEIR SENSE

04:53:00.763 --> 04:53:01.430
UNTIL THEY'VE COMPLETED

04:53:01.497 --> 04:53:02.831
SUPERVISED RELEASE PROBATION OR

04:53:02.898 --> 04:53:03.766
PAROLE.

04:53:03.832 --> 04:53:05.401
THAT POINT IN TIME THEN THEY

04:53:05.467 --> 04:53:07.169
SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO DO ALL

04:53:07.236 --> 04:53:10.105
THOSE THINGS THAT ONE WOULD DO --

04:53:10.172 --> 04:53:11.640
PRIOR TO HAVING A FELONY

04:53:11.707 --> 04:53:13.142
CONVINCE MY PERSONAL VIEW.

04:53:13.208 --> 04:53:15.444
SO I I I'M HOPING YOU'LL

04:53:15.511 --> 04:53:17.246
CONSIDER THAT AMENDMENT THAT

04:53:17.313 --> 04:53:19.348
THIS BILL WOULD APPLY TO THOSE

04:53:19.415 --> 04:53:24.787
WHO'VE COMPLETED THEIR SENSE.

04:53:24.853 --> 04:53:27.589
THE I BELIEVE IT WAS SENATOR

04:53:27.656 --> 04:53:31.961
JONES HAD A QUESTION.

04:53:32.027 --> 04:53:33.796
WELL LET ME ASK MORE DIRECTLY --

04:53:33.862 --> 04:53:35.331
BECAUSE THAT'S MY CONCERN AS

04:53:35.397 --> 04:53:38.500
WELL AND YOUR FIRST PHONE TO SAY

04:53:38.567 --> 04:53:39.268
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS

04:53:39.335 --> 04:53:40.836
ISSUE I NEVER EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT

04:53:40.903 --> 04:53:42.304
THIS SO THE FACT THAT YOU'RE

04:53:42.371 --> 04:53:43.672
BRINGING IT FORWARD AND AND

04:53:43.739 --> 04:53:45.140
GETTING OUR ATTENTION ON IT.

04:53:45.207 --> 04:53:47.710
I THINK IS GOOD -- I COULD SERVE

04:53:47.776 --> 04:53:51.146
CERTAINLY SUPPORT -- THE CONCEPT

04:53:51.213 --> 04:53:53.716
OF THE BILL BUT I I SURE CENTER --

04:53:53.782 --> 04:53:55.584
BURGERS -- CONCERNS I THINK I

04:53:55.651 --> 04:53:57.386
WOULD TAKE IT MAYBE ONE MORE

04:53:57.453 --> 04:53:58.754
STEP FURTHER IN THAT.

04:53:58.821 --> 04:54:00.856
YOU KNOW ONCE OF FELONS -- CIVIL

04:54:00.923 --> 04:54:05.194
RIGHTS ARE RESTORED -- I THINK

04:54:05.260 --> 04:54:07.896
THIS SENDS A POWERFUL MESSAGE TO

04:54:07.963 --> 04:54:08.630
THAT PERSON.

04:54:08.697 --> 04:54:10.432
THAT SOCIETY IS MAKING AN

04:54:10.499 --> 04:54:11.633
INVESTMENT.

04:54:11.700 --> 04:54:12.901
INTO THAT PERSON AND WE TRUST

04:54:12.968 --> 04:54:14.603
YOU.

04:54:14.670 --> 04:54:16.271
THIS IS A BIG DEAL SERVING ON A

04:54:16.338 --> 04:54:19.208
JURY -- AND SO HOW HOW DO YOU

04:54:19.274 --> 04:54:21.643
DRESS THAT I MEAN WHY WHY NOT

04:54:21.710 --> 04:54:23.312
PUT SOME RESTRICTIONS RIGHT OR

04:54:23.379 --> 04:54:25.948
YOU KNOW YOU KNOW IT -- I GUESS

04:54:26.015 --> 04:54:27.516
AS MICHAEL WHY NOT.

04:54:27.583 --> 04:54:30.352
BUT SOME LIMITATIONS ON IT.

04:54:30.419 --> 04:54:31.887
SO THERE IS A BILL.

04:54:31.954 --> 04:54:33.022
CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH THE

04:54:33.088 --> 04:54:35.591
LEGISLATURE THAT WOULD GIVE

04:54:35.657 --> 04:54:38.260
VOTING RIGHTS -- TO PERSONS IN

04:54:38.327 --> 04:54:39.395
CALIFORNIA WHO ARE ON PAROLE OR

04:54:39.461 --> 04:54:41.296
PROBATION.

04:54:41.363 --> 04:54:44.666
WE CALIFORNIA DOES NOT OBVIOUSLY

04:54:44.733 --> 04:54:47.069
ALLOWS FORMERLY CONVICTED FELONS

04:54:47.136 --> 04:54:50.739
TO VOTE -- BUT IT STILL

04:54:50.806 --> 04:54:52.508
RESTRICTS IF YOU'RE ON PROBATION

04:54:52.574 --> 04:54:55.010
OR PAROLE AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE

04:54:55.077 --> 04:54:56.278
LENGTH OF TIME.

04:54:56.345 --> 04:54:59.548
THAT WE NOW REQUIRE THAT WE HAVE

04:54:59.615 --> 04:55:02.985
MANY -- PROBATIONARY PERIOD'S --

04:55:03.052 --> 04:55:05.287
IN EFFECT WE WE WE HAVE SOME

04:55:05.354 --> 04:55:07.222
SENSE IS THAT BASICALLY KEEP A

04:55:07.289 --> 04:55:11.760
PERSON ON OF PAROLE RATHER FOR

04:55:11.827 --> 04:55:15.230
ALMOST. FOR ONE TWENTY THIRTY

04:55:15.297 --> 04:55:16.765
FORTY YEARS SO IN EFFECT WE'RE

04:55:16.832 --> 04:55:18.567
PREVENTING THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS

04:55:18.634 --> 04:55:20.069
FOR EVER BEING RESTORED.

04:55:20.135 --> 04:55:22.805
SO GIVEN THAT THE OTHER BILL'S

04:55:22.871 --> 04:55:24.640
GOING THROUGH I CAN'T PRESUME

04:55:24.706 --> 04:55:26.208
THAT IT WOULD PASS.

04:55:26.275 --> 04:55:28.143
BUT WHAT I THINK IS APPROPRIATE

04:55:28.210 --> 04:55:30.112
IS THAT YOUR FULL CIVIL RIGHTS

04:55:30.179 --> 04:55:31.880
SHOULD BE RESTORED AND THERE ARE

04:55:31.947 --> 04:55:33.549
OTHER STATES WHO HAVE DONE THIS.

04:55:33.615 --> 04:55:35.451
ONCE YOU HAVE.

04:55:35.517 --> 04:55:37.052
YOU LEFT YOUR INCARCERATION.

04:55:37.119 --> 04:55:41.390
AND BUT THAT'S MY OWN VIEW --

04:55:41.457 --> 04:55:43.158
AND CLEARLY THE VIEWS OF THOSE

04:55:43.225 --> 04:55:44.493
SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL WHO ARE

04:55:44.560 --> 04:55:45.994
ALSO SUPPORTING THE BILL THAT

04:55:46.061 --> 04:55:48.497
WOULD RESTORE VOTING RIGHTS. TO

04:55:48.564 --> 04:55:49.932
PEOPLE THAT ARE ON PAROLE

04:55:49.998 --> 04:55:50.232
[inaudible]

04:55:50.299 --> 04:55:51.667
I'M [inaudible]

04:55:51.733 --> 04:55:55.671
BUT YOU KNOW CERTAINLY -- AS WE

04:55:55.737 --> 04:55:58.307
MOVE THE BILL FORD IF WE

04:55:58.373 --> 04:56:01.110
CONFRONT -- CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE

04:56:01.176 --> 04:56:03.045
WE HAVE TO MAKE MODIFICATIONS --

04:56:03.112 --> 04:56:05.380
THOSE WILL BE CONSIDERED BUT WE

04:56:05.447 --> 04:56:09.051
ARE CERTAINLY RIGHT NOW TRYING --

04:56:09.118 --> 04:56:11.854
TO BOTH WRISTS DEUCE RECIDIVISM

04:56:11.920 --> 04:56:12.387
AND RESTORE PEOPLE'S CIVIL

04:56:12.454 --> 04:56:16.358
RIGHTS -- SO WITH WITH THAT I

04:56:16.425 --> 04:56:17.926
WOULD LOVE TO SUPPORT A BILL

04:56:17.993 --> 04:56:19.461
LIKE THIS I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS

04:56:19.528 --> 04:56:20.896
ONE TODAY.

04:56:20.963 --> 04:56:22.998
ALTHOUGH NO TODAY BUT IF AS YOU

04:56:23.065 --> 04:56:25.000
MOVE IT FORWARD IF YOU GET TO

04:56:25.067 --> 04:56:26.135
THE POINT WHERE YOU'RE HAVING TO

04:56:26.201 --> 04:56:28.137
AMEND IT -- I WANT TO KNOW SO

04:56:28.203 --> 04:56:29.671
THAT.

04:56:29.738 --> 04:56:31.507
MAYBE I CAN VOTE FOR YOU KNOW

04:56:31.573 --> 04:56:33.742
LATER ON THANK YOU.

04:56:33.809 --> 04:56:36.845
THANK YOU -- ANY OTHER COMMENTS

04:56:36.912 --> 04:56:39.014
RIGHT A CHURCH THE I'M I'M ALSO

04:56:39.081 --> 04:56:40.315
GOING TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY BUT

04:56:40.382 --> 04:56:42.451
I DO THINK THAT THAT THIS MIGHT

04:56:42.518 --> 04:56:46.688
BE A CONVERSATION -- THE NOTION

04:56:46.755 --> 04:56:49.191
THAT THAT IT SOMEONE SEARCH TIME

04:56:49.258 --> 04:56:50.893
IN PRISON THEY GET OUT AND IF

04:56:50.959 --> 04:56:54.196
THEY ARE STILL ON PAROLE -- THEY

04:56:54.263 --> 04:56:56.031
ARE NOT DISTANT THEY ARE NOT

04:56:56.098 --> 04:56:57.499
TOTALLY FREE FROM THEIR

04:56:57.566 --> 04:56:59.902
CIRCUMSTANCE AND SO I THINK THAT

04:56:59.968 --> 04:57:01.503
MIGHT BE GOING FORWARD A

04:57:01.570 --> 04:57:04.072
QUESTION TO ASK -- WHETHER IT

04:57:04.139 --> 04:57:06.975
WOULD BE APPROPRIATE ONCE THEY

04:57:07.042 --> 04:57:08.644
HAVE COMPLETED ALL THE TERMS OF

04:57:08.710 --> 04:57:11.113
THEIR PROBATION OR PAROLE THAT

04:57:11.180 --> 04:57:13.415
THIS WOULD BE -- SOMETHING TO

04:57:13.482 --> 04:57:15.751
WHICH THEY WOULD BE ENTITLED AND

04:57:15.817 --> 04:57:17.452
AND THAT SOCIETY WOULD BE

04:57:17.519 --> 04:57:19.121
HONORED TO PROVIDE FOR THEM.

04:57:19.188 --> 04:57:20.589
AGAIN I THINK IT'S SAID THAT AN

04:57:20.656 --> 04:57:22.224
ISSUE THAT'S WORTHY OF FURTHER

04:57:22.291 --> 04:57:23.692
DISCUSSION BUT I AM GONNA

04:57:23.759 --> 04:57:25.260
SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE I

04:57:25.327 --> 04:57:27.496
THINK -- THAT WE REALLY NEED TO

04:57:27.563 --> 04:57:30.999
LOOK AT THIS ISSUE AND TRY.

04:57:31.066 --> 04:57:34.636
TO RECOGNIZE THAT PEOPLE AND YOU

04:57:34.703 --> 04:57:35.270
KNOW THE IRONY IS SAID IN A LOT

04:57:35.337 --> 04:57:37.706
OF OUR RED STATE FRIENDS THEY

04:57:37.773 --> 04:57:41.310
ARE BEEN A LOT MORE WILLING --

04:57:41.376 --> 04:57:43.045
TO OPERATE OFF OF REDEMPTION AND

04:57:43.111 --> 04:57:45.314
SECOND CHANCES THAN WE HAVE HERE

04:57:45.380 --> 04:57:48.350
IN CALIFORNIA SO.

04:57:48.417 --> 04:57:49.751
IT'S KIND OF A A BIT OF A

04:57:49.818 --> 04:57:50.586
TWEENER BUT I I THINK THAT IT'S

04:57:50.652 --> 04:57:51.787
WORTHY OF MOVING THE BILL

04:57:51.853 --> 04:57:53.222
FORWARD TODAY SO DO WE HAVE A

04:57:53.288 --> 04:57:54.690
MOTION WE HAVE A MOTION BY

04:57:54.756 --> 04:57:56.258
CENTER A CASKET WOULD YOU LIKE

04:57:56.325 --> 04:57:57.326
TO CLOSE.

04:57:57.392 --> 04:58:01.496
THANK YOU -- FIVE IN FUTURE I

04:58:01.563 --> 04:58:03.966
WILL GET THE STATISTICS ON HOW

04:58:04.032 --> 04:58:05.500
MANY PEOPLE WE KEEP ON PAROLE

04:58:05.567 --> 04:58:06.802
AND FOR HOW LONG.

04:58:06.868 --> 04:58:09.738
AND YET WE EXPECTED THEM TO

04:58:09.805 --> 04:58:11.440
FULLY REINTEGRATE INTO THEIR

04:58:11.506 --> 04:58:12.574
COMMUNITIES WE EXPECT THEM TO

04:58:12.641 --> 04:58:14.243
GET A JOB WE EXPECT THEM TO GET

04:58:14.309 --> 04:58:16.345
HOUSING WE EXPECT IN FACT WE WE

04:58:16.411 --> 04:58:17.212
WANT THEM.

04:58:17.279 --> 04:58:18.880
AND YET WE DENY THE MOTHER CIVIL

04:58:18.947 --> 04:58:20.148
RIGHTS.

04:58:20.215 --> 04:58:23.452
AND SO ON I THINK WERE AT LEAST

04:58:23.518 --> 04:58:24.920
IN MY BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD

04:58:24.987 --> 04:58:26.521
I'M TRYING TO BRING THAT TO OUR

04:58:26.588 --> 04:58:28.557
ATTENTION AND TRYING TO SHOW

04:58:28.624 --> 04:58:29.358
THAT.

05:05:42.323 --> 05:05:44.893
URBAN INTERFACE OWNS -- AND THE

05:05:44.959 --> 05:05:46.227
CONCERN.

05:05:46.294 --> 05:05:47.629
THE CONCERN THAT WAS RAISED BY

05:05:47.696 --> 05:05:49.030
THAT AND LET ME JUST SAY THAT

05:05:49.097 --> 05:05:51.366
THAT'S NOT A NOT MY INTENTION

05:05:51.433 --> 05:05:52.000
THAT THIS WOULD BE USED IN THOSE

05:05:52.067 --> 05:05:54.602
OWNS -- BUY AND SO I'LL EXCEPT

05:05:54.669 --> 05:05:56.438
THE AMENDMENT BOB IS SUBJECT TO

05:05:56.504 --> 05:05:57.439
I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE

05:05:57.505 --> 05:05:58.973
MAPS SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT HOW

05:05:59.040 --> 05:06:01.009
THEY OVERLAY I DON'T THINK THAT

05:06:01.076 --> 05:06:02.711
THAT IT'S I THINK IT'S GOING TO

05:06:02.777 --> 05:06:04.012
WORK OUT JUST FINE BECAUSE I

05:06:04.079 --> 05:06:05.480
DON'T BELIEVE THESE.

05:06:05.547 --> 05:06:07.148
OPPORTUNITIES OWNS ARE.

05:06:07.215 --> 05:06:12.087
ARE PART OF THE WE MAPS BUT IT'S

05:06:12.153 --> 05:06:12.721
IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR US TO LOOK

05:06:12.787 --> 05:06:13.088
AT HIM.

05:06:13.154 --> 05:06:14.489
AND SO -- WITH THAT I ASK FOR

05:06:14.556 --> 05:06:16.524
YOUR SUPPORT TODAY SO BEFORE WE

05:06:16.591 --> 05:06:19.194
HAVE OUR WITNESSES -- WE HAD

05:06:19.260 --> 05:06:22.530
TALKED ABOUT -- CAN CONSTRUCTING

05:06:22.597 --> 05:06:24.432
THIS A BIT SO THAT THAT THIS

05:06:24.499 --> 05:06:28.002
WOULD BE A PILOT PROJECT --

05:06:28.069 --> 05:06:30.038
WHICH WOULD BE APPLICABLES IN

05:06:30.105 --> 05:06:33.942
YOUR DISTRICTS -- ARE YOU GOING

05:06:34.008 --> 05:06:35.910

05:06:35.977 --> 05:06:36.878
RIGHT.

05:06:36.945 --> 05:06:38.680
I THE REASON I'M ASKING IS THAT

05:06:38.747 --> 05:06:40.048
I THINK AND I'D LIKE STE MY

05:06:40.115 --> 05:06:42.417
COLLEAGUES TO BE AWARE OF THIS.

05:06:42.484 --> 05:06:45.854
THAT ARE WHEN YOU COMBINE THIS

05:06:45.920 --> 05:06:47.655
WITH SB SIX TWENTY ONE WHICH

05:06:47.722 --> 05:06:50.692
APPLIES TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING --

05:06:50.759 --> 05:06:52.594
THIS BECOMES A VERY BROAD

05:06:52.660 --> 05:06:54.362
PROJECT AND THE RESULT I THINK

05:06:54.429 --> 05:06:55.563
IS.

05:06:55.630 --> 05:06:58.366
AGAIN VERY FAR TO SIGNIFICANT WE

05:06:58.433 --> 05:06:59.434
TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE

05:06:59.501 --> 05:07:00.602
CONCERNS WITH THE COURT THIS

05:07:00.668 --> 05:07:02.337
WILL OPEN IT.

05:07:02.403 --> 05:07:05.473
EVEN FAR FARTHER -- AND AGAIN

05:07:05.540 --> 05:07:07.175
EXPEDITING REVIEW.

05:07:07.242 --> 05:07:10.044
OF WE HAVE SECRET HERE IN

05:07:10.111 --> 05:07:12.013
INHERENTLY PRIORITIZING THESE

05:07:12.080 --> 05:07:13.515
CASES OVER EVERYTHING ELSE

05:07:13.581 --> 05:07:15.483
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WRONGFUL

05:07:15.550 --> 05:07:16.985
EVICTION SO WE TALKED ABOUT

05:07:17.051 --> 05:07:20.522
EARLIER -- CIVIL RIGHTS CASES OR

05:07:20.588 --> 05:07:22.657
PEOPLE WHOSE HOMES WERE LOST IN

05:07:22.724 --> 05:07:25.160
THE FIRES -- THIS WILL PREEMPT

05:07:25.226 --> 05:07:28.496
ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND WILD.

05:07:28.563 --> 05:07:30.298
I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF THESE

05:07:30.365 --> 05:07:34.869
THINGS TO BEGIN WITH -- I AM --

05:07:34.936 --> 05:07:36.938
PERSONALLY IMPACTED BY THE OVER

05:07:37.005 --> 05:07:38.807
WHAT I THINK THE OVER BROAD

05:07:38.873 --> 05:07:40.775
NATURE OF THIS PILOT PROJECT THE

05:07:40.842 --> 05:07:41.576
IS.

05:07:41.643 --> 05:07:43.211
A OR RATHER IT DEAD DOING

05:07:43.278 --> 05:07:45.013
SOMETHING BEYOND A PILOT PROJECT

05:07:45.079 --> 05:07:46.581
IT'S JUST TOO BROAD AS FAR AS

05:07:46.648 --> 05:07:49.584
I'M CONCERNED -- I THINK IT WILL

05:07:49.651 --> 05:07:51.052
I THINK IT WOULD BE.

05:07:51.119 --> 05:07:53.087
A VERY POSITIVE THING ADDRESSING

05:07:53.154 --> 05:07:54.622
YOUR DISTRICT BECAUSE AS YOU

05:07:54.689 --> 05:07:57.125
MENTIONED THERE ARE --

05:07:57.192 --> 05:08:00.228
SIGNIFICANT NEEDS THEIR BUT TO

05:08:00.295 --> 05:08:02.797
EXPAND THIS STATEWIDE IN ALL

05:08:02.864 --> 05:08:04.532
AREAS I THINK IS A WAY OVER

05:08:04.599 --> 05:08:05.633
REGION I WOULD.

05:08:05.700 --> 05:08:08.236
ASK YOU TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER A

05:08:08.303 --> 05:08:10.538
NARROWING IT BECAUSE I FRANKLY

05:08:10.605 --> 05:08:12.373
CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL IN ITS IN

05:08:12.440 --> 05:08:14.509
AS BROAD AS IT IS AT THIS POINT

05:08:14.576 --> 05:08:15.343
I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY COLLEAGUES

05:08:15.410 --> 05:08:17.011
FEEL.

05:08:17.078 --> 05:08:18.947
BUT I THINK THIS IS -- TO TO GET

05:08:19.013 --> 05:08:20.582
INTO THESE OPPORTUNITY STONE'S

05:08:20.648 --> 05:08:21.549
THERE ARE MANY OF THEM

05:08:21.616 --> 05:08:22.851
THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

05:08:22.917 --> 05:08:25.253
THE BILL SAYS IF YOU TAKE EVEN.

05:08:25.320 --> 05:08:27.322
IF IT IS FUNDED IN WHOLE OR IN

05:08:27.388 --> 05:08:29.691
PART COULD BE A VERY.

05:08:29.757 --> 05:08:32.460
SMALL INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT WEEK

05:08:32.527 --> 05:08:35.129
WE WOULD FIND OURSELVES I THINK --

05:08:35.196 --> 05:08:37.365
OVERWHELMED IN INUNDATED BY THE

05:08:37.432 --> 05:08:41.069
SEQUEL CASES -- AND I THINK THAT

05:08:41.135 --> 05:08:41.903
THAT.

05:08:41.970 --> 05:08:47.041
THAT IS AN OVER REACH SO -- YOUR

05:08:47.108 --> 05:08:48.209

05:08:48.276 --> 05:08:48.977

NEARLY SIXTEEN MONTHS THE

HABITAT DEVELOPMENT ON JEFFERSON

05:09:58.546 --> 05:10:01.182
AVENUE IN REDWOOD CITY IN SAN

05:10:01.249 --> 05:10:02.483
MATEO COUNTY.

05:10:02.550 --> 05:10:04.285
STATE NEEDLESSLY STALLED AS WE

05:10:04.352 --> 05:10:05.987
FOUGHT A BASELESS SEAQUEST

05:10:06.054 --> 05:10:07.322
LAWSUIT.

05:10:07.388 --> 05:10:08.623
IT WAS FILED BY LOCAL BUSINESS

05:10:08.690 --> 05:10:09.791
WITH A TRACK RECORD OF

05:10:09.857 --> 05:10:11.459
INITIATING SEQUEL LITIGATION

05:10:11.526 --> 05:10:14.362
AGAINST DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AREA.

05:10:14.429 --> 05:10:15.630
TWENTY LOCAL FAMILIES WITH

05:10:15.697 --> 05:10:17.699
HOUSEHOLD INCOMES BETWEEN FIFTY

05:10:17.765 --> 05:10:19.600
AND 80% OF THE AREA MEDIAN

05:10:19.667 --> 05:10:20.568
INCOME.

05:10:20.635 --> 05:10:21.703
SHOULD BE GETTING READY TO MOVE

05:10:21.769 --> 05:10:24.305
IN AND BY THESE HOMES RIGHT NOW.

05:10:24.372 --> 05:10:25.707
INSTEAD THE PROJECT WAS

05:10:25.773 --> 05:10:27.208
UNNECESSARILY DELAYED BY AN

05:10:27.275 --> 05:10:29.377
EFFORT TO RAISE COSTS HIGH

05:10:29.444 --> 05:10:30.645
ENOUGH TO KILL THE PROJECT.

05:10:30.712 --> 05:10:32.213
WELL I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT WE

05:10:32.280 --> 05:10:33.715
ARE NEARLY READY TO SEND OUT

05:10:33.781 --> 05:10:34.749
GROUND BREAKING CEREMONY

05:10:34.816 --> 05:10:37.485
INVITATIONS IT HAS BEEN A LONG

05:10:37.552 --> 05:10:39.187
HARD EFFORT TO GET TO THIS POINT.

05:10:39.253 --> 05:10:40.221
AND NEARLY A YEAR AND A HALF

05:10:40.288 --> 05:10:41.856
BEHIND SCHEDULE.

05:10:41.923 --> 05:10:42.957
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT

05:10:43.024 --> 05:10:44.225
OUT THAT BY THE TIME WE WERE

05:10:44.292 --> 05:10:45.426
SERVED WITH THE LAWSUIT THE

05:10:45.493 --> 05:10:47.829
PROJECT HAD ALREADY HAD ITS

05:10:47.895 --> 05:10:49.097
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT.

05:10:49.163 --> 05:10:50.531
METICULOUSLY REVIEWED AND

05:10:50.598 --> 05:10:52.633
UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE LAWSUIT

05:10:52.700 --> 05:10:54.669
CAME IN LATE AND WAS BASED ON

05:10:54.736 --> 05:10:56.237
LATE OMMENTS.

05:10:56.304 --> 05:10:58.006
IN OUR CASE WE WORKED HARD HAND

05:10:58.072 --> 05:10:59.774
WE HAD WORKED HAND IN HAND WITH

05:10:59.841 --> 05:11:01.209
MUNICIPAL PLANNERS.

05:11:01.275 --> 05:11:02.577
AND THE LOCAL COMMUNITY EVERY

05:11:02.643 --> 05:11:04.345
STEP OF THE WAY WE KNEW OUR

05:11:04.412 --> 05:11:05.580
ENVIRONMENTALIST ESTIMATES WERE

05:11:05.646 --> 05:11:07.415
THOROUGH AND WE ARE PROUD OF THE

05:11:07.482 --> 05:11:09.050
FACT THAT THE CITY COUNCIL HAD

05:11:09.117 --> 05:11:11.019
UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE

05:11:11.085 --> 05:11:11.586
DEVELOPMENT.

05:11:11.652 --> 05:11:13.654
AT A MEETING PACKED WITH REDWOOD

05:11:13.721 --> 05:11:15.723

05:11:15.790 --> 05:11:16.791
AFFORDABLE DEVELOPERS IN

05:11:16.858 --> 05:11:18.793
CALIFORNIA SEQUEL LOSSES

05:11:18.860 --> 05:11:21.629
LAWSUITS IT SEEMS ARE JUST A

05:11:21.696 --> 05:11:23.064
COST OF DOING BUSINESS.

05:11:23.131 --> 05:11:24.799
SIMPLY BY ISSUING A LAWSUIT THE

05:11:24.866 --> 05:11:27.035
PLAINTIFF CAN CAUSE MAJOR DELAYS

05:11:27.101 --> 05:11:29.604
AND MAJOR COSTS THAT'S WHY THE

05:11:29.670 --> 05:11:30.938
SENSIBLE REFORMS OF SEQUEL

05:11:31.005 --> 05:11:32.707
LITIGATION LIKE THOSE PROPOSED

05:11:32.774 --> 05:11:34.242
IN SB.

05:11:34.308 --> 05:11:35.309
TWENTY FIVE WILL HAVE A POSITIVE

05:11:35.376 --> 05:11:37.278
IMPACT ON THE NUMBER OF HOMES

05:11:37.345 --> 05:11:38.780
THAT CAN BE BUILT FOR WORKING

05:11:38.846 --> 05:11:42.216
FAMILIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA THANK

05:11:47.155 --> 05:11:48.356
ALSO TO CLARIFY.

05:11:48.423 --> 05:11:50.158
IT DOES NOT APPLY TO EVERY

05:11:50.224 --> 05:11:51.592
PROJECT WITHIN OPPORTUNITIES OWN

05:11:51.659 --> 05:11:53.227

05:11:53.294 --> 05:11:54.462
OPPORTUNITY FUNDS.

05:11:54.529 --> 05:11:55.863
AND ANOTHER WAY THAT THE BILL IS

05:11:55.930 --> 05:11:57.365
TECHNICALLY NARROW BY PROJECTS

05:11:57.432 --> 05:11:58.466
AS THEY MUST HAVE A SKILLED AND

05:11:58.533 --> 05:11:59.934
TRAINED WORKFORCE AND THAT'S NOT

05:12:00.001 --> 05:12:01.335
EVERY PROJECT FUNDED BY THE

05:12:01.402 --> 05:12:02.403
DOLLARS THAT ARE LISTED IN THE

05:12:02.470 --> 05:12:03.137

CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL

05:12:07.608 --> 05:12:08.676
THANK YOU WE'RE TRYING TO

05:12:08.743 --> 05:12:09.677
BALANCE THE NEEDS OF THE

05:12:09.744 --> 05:12:10.945
ENVIRONMENT WITH SOME ECONOMIC

05:12:11.012 --> 05:12:11.813
DEVELOPMENT.

05:18:19.747 --> 05:18:21.816
APPROVED THE CHALLENGERS WERE

05:18:21.882 --> 05:18:22.983
HOPING IT WOULD COME DOWN A

05:18:23.050 --> 05:18:24.552
FLOOR TWO BUT SETTLED FOR

05:18:24.618 --> 05:18:26.187
MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS SO THEY

05:18:26.253 --> 05:18:27.121
GOT A LITTLE SOMETHING DATING

05:18:27.188 --> 05:18:29.990
GET WHAT THEY WANTED PER SE.

05:18:30.057 --> 05:18:31.592
BUT AGAIN.

05:18:31.659 --> 05:18:33.761
THIS IS THIS IS WHERE SHE WORKS.

05:18:33.828 --> 05:18:35.062
THERE WAS ANY INTERACTION YOU

05:18:35.129 --> 05:18:36.430
KNOW WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT

05:18:36.497 --> 05:18:38.065
GIVING TENANTS THE OPPORTUNITY

05:18:38.132 --> 05:18:39.800
TO SAY THEIR PIECE.

05:18:39.867 --> 05:18:41.569
OUR THIS IS WHAT.

05:18:41.635 --> 05:18:43.671
THIS IS WHAT SHE COULD THOMAS

05:18:43.737 --> 05:18:45.272
AND TO BE ABLE.

05:18:45.339 --> 05:18:47.174
TO BROADLY OPEN THIS UP AND HAVE

05:18:47.241 --> 05:18:49.143
A TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAY

05:18:49.210 --> 05:18:50.711
REVIEW PERIOD WHICH DOES NOT

05:18:50.778 --> 05:18:52.012
GIVE.

05:18:52.079 --> 05:18:55.115
THE PARTIES THE TIME NECESSARY --

05:18:55.182 --> 05:18:57.151
IF THERE IS INDEED A A REAL

05:18:57.218 --> 05:19:00.387
CHALLENGE -- IN YOUR CASE.

05:19:00.454 --> 05:19:03.524
THERE WAS NO TRIAL NO DELAY.

05:19:03.591 --> 05:19:04.959
THE THE PARTIES ACTUALLY WROTE

05:19:05.025 --> 05:19:06.794
THE REQUESTED AN EXTENSION TO

05:19:06.861 --> 05:19:10.164
THE BRIEFING SCHEDULE BOTH SIDES --

05:19:10.231 --> 05:19:13.167
AND AND AND SO WHO NO THIS IS

05:19:13.234 --> 05:19:14.502
WHERE THE SYSTEM WORKS.

05:19:14.568 --> 05:19:17.304
THIS BILL WITHOUT ANY KIND OF

05:19:17.371 --> 05:19:19.540
CONTAINMENT ARCHES BLOWS A HUGE

05:19:19.607 --> 05:19:24.044
HOLE IN IN THE SYSTEM AND THIS

05:19:24.111 --> 05:19:26.313
IS -- I I THINK A VERY DANGEROUS

05:19:26.380 --> 05:19:28.549
PRECEDENT WE JUST DID THE BILL

05:19:28.616 --> 05:19:29.917
THAT ARE THAT ARE TALKS ABOUT

05:19:29.984 --> 05:19:31.719
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

05:19:31.785 --> 05:19:35.189
AND I I THINK THAT IT IS.

05:19:35.256 --> 05:19:37.591
IT JUST AN UNREALISTIC EFFORT

05:19:37.658 --> 05:19:40.528
AND AGAIN I WOULD.

05:19:40.594 --> 05:19:43.430
LIKE TO ENCOURAGE THE THE AUTHOR

05:19:43.497 --> 05:19:46.133
TO FOCUS THIS ON OPPORTUNITY

05:19:46.200 --> 05:19:48.235
STONE'S WITH IN.

05:19:48.302 --> 05:19:49.803
OF THE COUNTIES THAT ARE --

05:19:49.870 --> 05:19:52.773
WITHIN YOUR DISTRICT -- YOU

05:19:52.840 --> 05:19:54.041
MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET THIS OUT

05:19:54.108 --> 05:19:56.410
BUT I THINK THE THIS IS GOING TO

05:19:56.477 --> 05:19:57.811
ULTIMATELY WREAK HAVOC ON OUR

05:19:57.878 --> 05:19:59.146
COURT SYSTEM BECAUSE THE

05:19:59.213 --> 05:20:01.081
PRIORITIES THAT THE SEQUEL CASES

05:20:01.148 --> 05:20:02.716
ARE GOING TO GET ARE GOING TO BE

05:20:02.783 --> 05:20:04.018
TO THE DETRIMENT.

05:20:04.084 --> 05:20:04.852
OF OTHER THINGS THAT I KNOW WE

05:20:04.919 --> 05:20:07.821
ALL HAVE FOUGHT HARD TO SEE AN

05:20:07.888 --> 05:20:09.924
END CARE DEEPLY ABOUT SO AGAIN I

05:20:09.990 --> 05:20:10.591
WOULD.

05:20:10.658 --> 05:20:12.026
I WOULD ASK THE AUTHOR TO

05:20:12.092 --> 05:20:15.229
CONSIDER -- CONSIDER.

05:20:15.296 --> 05:20:17.398
A CHESTER CREATING THIS PILOT

05:20:17.464 --> 05:20:18.832
PROJECT.

05:20:18.899 --> 05:20:20.834
OF THIS IS JUST THE THE SCOPE

05:20:20.901 --> 05:20:22.036
AND THIS IS JUST I THINK

05:20:22.102 --> 05:20:24.371
OVERWHELMING.

05:20:24.438 --> 05:20:25.439
SO WITH THAT.

05:20:25.506 --> 05:20:27.207
US SENATOR BORCHERS HAS QUESTION

05:20:27.274 --> 05:20:30.010
AND SENATOR ALAN.

05:20:30.077 --> 05:20:30.778
IT'S REALLY DON'T WANT TO

05:20:30.844 --> 05:20:33.647
BELABOR -- THE MOST CRITICAL

05:20:33.714 --> 05:20:34.848
ISSUES THAT WE DISCUSSED ON THE

05:20:34.915 --> 05:20:37.618
LAST ITEM -- I'M SUPPORTER OF

05:20:37.685 --> 05:20:40.054
THIS BECAUSE OUR HOUSING STOCK.

05:20:40.120 --> 05:20:43.090
IS AT A CRITICAL JUNCTURE AND WE

05:20:43.157 --> 05:20:45.593
NEED TO TO TAKE ACTION TO TO

05:20:45.659 --> 05:20:47.795
REMEDY THIS PROBLEM AT LEAST IN

05:20:47.861 --> 05:20:50.397
PART -- I WILL CERTAINLY BE

05:20:50.464 --> 05:20:52.800
SUPPORTING THIS -- TODAY -- I

05:20:52.866 --> 05:20:54.168
THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE

05:20:54.234 --> 05:20:55.569
PAST.

05:20:55.636 --> 05:20:59.540
I DID -- FROM -- THE DAIS ON

05:20:59.607 --> 05:21:00.975
DISCUSSION IS THAT.

05:21:01.041 --> 05:21:03.310
I IS THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL

05:21:03.377 --> 05:21:06.747
WILLING TO CONTINUE TO WORK AND

05:21:06.814 --> 05:21:08.048
MAKE THE BILL BETTER.

05:21:08.115 --> 05:21:09.950
IN THE PROCESS.

05:21:10.017 --> 05:21:11.385
AND SO I THINK THAT'S KIND OF

05:21:11.452 --> 05:21:13.320
WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW.

05:21:13.387 --> 05:21:15.456
IS THAT -- WE'VE HEARD SOME

05:21:15.522 --> 05:21:17.891
CONCERNS -- FROM.

05:21:17.958 --> 05:21:19.927
FROM FOLKS TODAY WE'LL PROBABLY

05:21:21.762 --> 05:21:23.564
THROUGH THE PROCESS.

05:21:23.631 --> 05:21:24.131
JUST WANTED TO HEAR FROM THE

05:21:24.198 --> 05:21:25.566
AUTHOR.

05:21:25.633 --> 05:21:26.867
IF YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO STILL

05:21:26.934 --> 05:21:30.504

AS NEEDED -- ONE OF THOSE THAT.

05:21:35.709 --> 05:21:37.177
MIGHT BE WORTH CONSIDERING --

05:21:37.244 --> 05:21:38.612
DOWN THE ROAD MAYBE NOT TODAY

05:21:38.679 --> 05:21:40.114
BUT DOWN THE ROAD.

05:23:27.821 --> 05:23:30.557
THE LACK OF DEVELOPMENT IN THESE

05:23:30.624 --> 05:23:32.693
OPPORTUNITIES OWNED IS

05:23:32.760 --> 05:23:35.195

TO BE HONEST YOU KNOW THERE WERE

05:25:58.071 --> 05:25:58.805

05:25:58.872 --> 05:26:00.507
PROJECTS BUILT UNDER THIS THEN --

05:26:00.574 --> 05:26:02.509

CARES GREAT ABOUT THE

05:26:07.381 --> 05:26:09.416
ENVIRONMENT BUT I I JUST ASK US

05:26:09.483 --> 05:26:10.984
TO KIND OF CONTEMPLATE WHAT --

05:26:11.051 --> 05:26:14.221
WHAT A GAME CHANGER IT BE IF WE

05:26:14.288 --> 05:26:16.556
STARTED BUILDING AT AT AT IN ON

05:26:16.623 --> 05:26:18.592

I MEAN THAT IS THAT IS THAT THAT

05:26:23.297 --> 05:26:24.498
IS SUCH A GAME CHANGER FROM

05:26:24.564 --> 05:26:27.401
EVERYTHING FROM ENERGY. TO THE

05:26:27.467 --> 05:26:28.702
OTHERS THE ANTI PROVISIONS IN

05:26:28.769 --> 05:26:31.138
THERE THAT REALLY TO TRAFFIC AND

05:26:31.204 --> 05:26:34.007
AND TRANSIT OR IN DEVELOPMENT --

05:26:34.074 --> 05:26:37.577
YOU KNOW -- WATER -- EFFICIENCY

05:26:37.644 --> 05:26:38.946
AND AND I'M THAT THERE THERE'S

05:26:39.012 --> 05:26:40.547
JUST SO MUCH VALUE ASSOCIATED

05:26:40.614 --> 05:26:42.182
WITH THE LEGAL CERTIFICATION IT

05:26:42.249 --> 05:26:44.217
IT'S A HIGH STANDARD FOR FOR

05:26:44.284 --> 05:26:44.818
CONSTRUCTION FOR BUILDINGS AND

05:26:44.885 --> 05:26:45.519
AS I SAY.

05:26:45.585 --> 05:26:47.120
YOU'VE ALSO INCLUDED GREENHOUSE

05:26:47.187 --> 05:26:50.190

HERE SO THOSE ARE REALLY HIGH

05:26:54.828 --> 05:26:55.996
ENVIRONMENTAL BARS I THINK THAT

05:26:56.063 --> 05:26:57.731
THEY OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED IN

05:26:57.798 --> 05:27:03.303

THAT WE MOVED ON TO AN EXPEDITED.

05:31:02.375 --> 05:31:04.177
JUDICIAL REVIEW DIDN'T TOUCH ANY

THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES WE IN

FACT ENHANCE THEM.

05:31:07.547 --> 05:31:09.316
BECAUSE THAT GETS US TO WHERE WE

INDICATED TO ME THAT.

05:33:59.185 --> 05:34:01.821
WE ALSO HAD OFFERED TO THE

05:34:01.888 --> 05:34:03.990
HOUSING AND TRANSIT ONLY AS AN

05:34:04.057 --> 05:34:05.759
OPTION WHICH WAS APPARENTLY ALSO

05:34:05.825 --> 05:34:06.826
REJECTED SO.

05:34:06.893 --> 05:34:08.728
WE WE JUST HAVEN'T BEEN ON THE

SAME WAVELENGTH HERE I'M REALLY.

05:34:11.998 --> 05:34:13.166
I I JUST THINK.

05:34:13.233 --> 05:34:16.069
IF YOU HAVE.

05:34:16.136 --> 05:34:17.804
ALL OF THESE ISSUES TO HAVE THEM

IN SUCH A CONSOLIDATED FASHION

05:34:20.473 --> 05:34:22.008
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE.

05:34:22.075 --> 05:34:26.813
TO DO JUSTICE TO THE ISSUES AND

05:34:26.880 --> 05:34:28.214
AGAIN.

05:34:28.281 --> 05:34:30.116
I I THINK THAT THE CERTAINLY THE

05:34:30.183 --> 05:34:33.019
ABILITY TO FOCUS TO TO TRY THIS

05:34:33.086 --> 05:34:34.687
PILOT PROJECT I THINK -- GIVES

05:34:34.754 --> 05:34:36.623
YOU I THINK WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING

05:34:36.689 --> 05:34:39.092
FOR BUT I I THINK ANYTHING

05:34:39.159 --> 05:34:41.161
BEYOND THAT JUST CREATES SUCH A

05:34:41.227 --> 05:34:43.496
BROAD SWATH THAT IT'S GOING.

05:34:43.563 --> 05:34:45.165
TO BE.

05:34:45.231 --> 05:34:47.000
ON ON WIELDING IN ON ON DOABLE

05:34:47.066 --> 05:34:48.735
AND DID YOU WANT TO COMMENT YES

05:34:48.802 --> 05:34:50.937
I DID -- WHEN IT JUST KIND OF

05:34:51.004 --> 05:34:51.738
TOUCH UP ON WHAT SENATOR WHY

05:34:51.805 --> 05:34:53.506
BECAUSE HE SAID WHICH WAS --

05:34:53.573 --> 05:34:55.008
BECAUSE OF THOSE MAY GET A

05:34:55.074 --> 05:34:56.943
NEGATIVE DECORATIONS AND INDIES

05:34:57.010 --> 05:34:58.111
THEY'RE ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO A

05:34:58.178 --> 05:34:59.879
FULL ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS WHICH

05:34:59.946 --> 05:35:01.147
MEANS NOW YOU'RE WE NOW YOU'RE

05:35:01.214 --> 05:35:02.282
BASICALLY TELLING COURTS TO

05:35:02.348 --> 05:35:03.716
RESOLVE THIS ISSUE OF WHETHER OR

05:35:03.783 --> 05:35:05.018
NOT THEY SHOULD HAVE GONE TO A

05:35:05.084 --> 05:35:06.419
FULL ENVIRONMENT A PROCESS IN.

05:35:06.486 --> 05:35:07.887
SINCE IT'S THE COURT OF APPEALS

05:35:07.954 --> 05:35:10.123
SUPERIOR COURT AD SUPREME COURT

05:35:10.190 --> 05:35:11.991
WHAT THREE MONTHS TIME.

05:35:12.058 --> 05:35:14.027
ESSENTIALLY LIKE IN CASE THAT

05:35:14.093 --> 05:35:15.695
LIKE WITH THE PILLS ON IT AND I

05:35:15.762 --> 05:35:17.130
HAVE ADMITTEDLY ONLY PRACTICE

05:35:17.197 --> 05:35:18.932
FOR A YEAR BUT I FOR A ONLY NOW

05:35:18.998 --> 05:35:19.933
I KNOW FOR A FACT.

05:35:19.999 --> 05:35:21.434
THAT ONE CASE THAT I GOT ON THE

05:35:21.501 --> 05:35:22.135
SECOND DAY THAT I STARTED

05:35:22.202 --> 05:35:23.903
PRACTICING WAS NOT FINISHED THE

05:35:23.970 --> 05:35:25.872
YEAR THAT I WAS I DECIDED TO

05:35:25.939 --> 05:35:26.739
COME TO SIERRA CLUB.

05:35:26.806 --> 05:35:28.908
AND SO I JUST DON'T SEE EIGHT

05:35:28.975 --> 05:35:29.976
AND THAT WAS ONLY IN THE TRIAL

05:35:30.043 --> 05:35:32.278
COURT AND SO I JUST DON'T SEE

05:35:32.345 --> 05:35:32.979
THE FEASIBILITY OF BEING ABLE TO

05:35:33.046 --> 05:35:33.480
DO THAT.

05:35:33.546 --> 05:35:34.914
RIGHT ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR

05:35:34.981 --> 05:35:36.349
QUESTIONS ARE WE GOING TO WRAP

05:35:36.416 --> 05:35:38.485

05:35:38.551 --> 05:35:40.487
BRIEFLY CENTER ALLEN VERY

05:35:40.553 --> 05:35:41.354

MEAN CLEAR THIS IS SOME OF THE

05:35:45.725 --> 05:35:47.126
PEOPLE STRUGGLE AS I I DO THINK

05:35:47.193 --> 05:35:49.295
THAT -- YOU KNOW GIVEN THE

05:35:49.362 --> 05:35:50.897
CONVERSATION ABOUT HOUSING.

05:35:50.964 --> 05:35:52.932
ON THAT I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT I

05:35:52.999 --> 05:35:54.367
WAS PART OF THE DISCUSSION WAS

05:35:54.434 --> 05:35:55.502
LIEU NEARING IT HOUSING IN

05:35:55.568 --> 05:35:58.104
TRANSIT -- YEAH THAT THAT WOULD

05:35:58.171 --> 05:36:05.278
BE SOMETHING TO CONSIDER MOVING

05:36:05.345 --> 05:36:09.015
FORWARD -- IF YOU KNOW.

05:36:09.082 --> 05:36:09.616
YEAH I'M I'M ON THE SUPPORTED

05:36:09.682 --> 05:36:10.416

WITH THE DURING ANY Q. -- BUT

05:36:11.384 --> 05:36:11.985
BUT I I I WOULD I WOULD STRONGLY

05:36:12.051 --> 05:36:13.019
CONSIDER THAT IN THE FUTURE

05:36:13.086 --> 05:36:13.953
ESPECIALLY IN ASSUMING AT THIS

05:36:14.020 --> 05:36:14.554
BILL IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO

05:36:14.621 --> 05:36:15.488
HAVE CHALLENGES.

05:36:15.555 --> 05:36:16.789
AT VARIOUS STAGES IN THE PROCESS

05:36:16.856 --> 05:36:18.758
BUT BUT THAT WOULD REALLY CN

05:36:18.825 --> 05:36:20.226
ZERO IN THE DISCUSSION INTO TWO

05:36:20.293 --> 05:36:21.528
AREAS ARE WE REALLY KNOW WE HAVE

05:36:21.594 --> 05:36:23.029
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS.

05:36:23.096 --> 05:36:24.397
I STILL THINK WOULD MAKE ME

05:36:24.464 --> 05:36:27.233
WOULD DO BIG WOULD MAKE A BIG

05:36:27.300 --> 05:36:27.867
DIFFERENCE FOR FOLKS AROUND THE

05:36:27.934 --> 05:36:29.168
STATE.

05:36:29.235 --> 05:36:32.372
STE HI SO -- IS THAT SOMETHING

05:36:32.438 --> 05:36:35.308
THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO CONSIDER.

05:36:35.375 --> 05:36:37.343
SO YOU WANT ME TO CLOSE NO I AND

05:36:37.410 --> 05:36:40.046
WE WE HAVE SENATOR -- BORDERS

05:36:40.113 --> 05:36:41.481
HAVE ONE LIMITATION ECONOMY JUST

05:36:41.548 --> 05:36:43.149
SAY THAT THE OFFER IS I

05:36:43.216 --> 05:36:44.484
UNDERSTOOD IT WAS AFFORDABLE

05:36:44.551 --> 05:36:47.153
HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION.

05:36:47.220 --> 05:36:49.489
AND AND LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THE

05:36:49.556 --> 05:36:50.456
CHALLENGE WITH.

05:36:50.523 --> 05:36:51.257
WITH.

05:36:51.324 --> 05:36:53.026
THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

05:36:53.092 --> 05:36:56.763
IN -- OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING ONLY

05:36:56.829 --> 05:36:58.865
IN OPPORTUNITY ZONES IS IT THESE

05:36:58.932 --> 05:37:02.835
ARE ARE POOREST NEIGHBORHOODS --

05:37:02.902 --> 05:37:04.571
IF YOU THINK WELL LET ME JUST

05:37:04.637 --> 05:37:07.807
PUT IT IN A POSITIVE. TO ONLY

05:37:07.874 --> 05:37:10.510
&lt;c.green&gt;UILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN OUR&lt;/c&gt;

05:37:10.577 --> 05:37:12.278
POOREST NEIGHBORHOODS.

05:37:12.345 --> 05:37:14.380
IS OFFENSIVE TO ME FRANKLY AND

05:37:14.447 --> 05:37:16.182
QUITE RIGHTEOUSLY WOULD BRING

05:37:16.249 --> 05:37:18.751
DOWN THE WRATH OF ALL THE PEOPLE

05:37:18.818 --> 05:37:19.819
THAT STOOD UP AND DIDN'T LIKE IT

05:37:19.886 --> 05:37:21.554
THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE

05:37:21.621 --> 05:37:23.156
THAT IS OVER CONCENTRATION OF

05:37:23.222 --> 05:37:25.425
POVERTY AND SO THAT DIDN'T MAKE

05:37:25.491 --> 05:37:26.492
ANY SENSE NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER

05:37:26.559 --> 05:37:27.193
TWO IS.

05:37:27.260 --> 05:37:28.494
THE PROBLEM THAT RURAL

05:37:28.561 --> 05:37:31.497
CALIFORNIA HAS -- WITH HOW WE

05:37:31.564 --> 05:37:34.400
FIND TRANSPORTATION ISSUES IS

05:37:34.467 --> 05:37:35.168
THAT.

05:37:35.234 --> 05:37:38.371
WE HAVEN'T PRIORITIZED.

05:37:38.438 --> 05:37:41.074
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION FROM OUR

05:37:41.140 --> 05:37:44.177
BIGGER CITIES INTO RURAL-CALIFORNIA IN A WAY THAT MAKES

05:37:44.243 --> 05:37:45.545
IT EASY FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO

05:37:45.612 --> 05:37:46.746
TAKE THE TRAIN OR TO TAKE PUBLIC

05:37:46.813 --> 05:37:47.914
TRANSPORTATION HOME.

05:37:47.981 --> 05:37:49.849
AND SENATOR MONEY KNOWS THAT

05:37:49.916 --> 05:37:50.617
BECAUSE I USED TO HITCH A RIDE

05:37:50.683 --> 05:37:52.919
WITH HIM. TO GET BACK HOME AND

05:37:52.986 --> 05:37:54.821
AND I DO REGULARLY BECAUSE I

05:37:54.887 --> 05:37:57.156
WANT TO BE ABLE TO NOT DRIVE

05:37:57.223 --> 05:37:59.425
MYSELF AND SO IT IT JUST DIDN'T

05:37:59.492 --> 05:38:01.995
WORK -- AND SO WITH WITH ALL DUE

05:38:02.061 --> 05:38:02.895
RESPECT.

05:38:02.962 --> 05:38:04.364
I APPRECIATE THE OFFERS THAT

05:38:04.430 --> 05:38:06.332
WERE MADE BUT BUT FRANKLY THIS

05:38:06.399 --> 05:38:08.501
IS THIS IS SUCH A BIG ISSUE THAT

05:38:08.568 --> 05:38:09.869
AND AND I EAT MY COMMITMENT IS

05:38:09.936 --> 05:38:11.704
AT ALL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS

05:38:11.771 --> 05:38:13.506
ALL CONTINUE. TO TO TO NARROW IT

05:38:13.573 --> 05:38:15.408
IN TO FIGURE OUT HOW HOW IT CAN

05:38:15.475 --> 05:38:16.976
BE BETTER BECAUSE IN THE END I

05:38:17.043 --> 05:38:18.945
WANTED TO WORK AND I WANTED TO

05:38:19.012 --> 05:38:21.080
BE TO BE A TOOL THAT WE CAN USE

05:38:21.147 --> 05:38:22.348
ALL OVER THE STATE.

05:38:22.415 --> 05:38:23.916
THANK YOU ARE DID YOU WANT TO

05:38:23.983 --> 05:38:25.652
SAY SOMETHING CENTER BORDERS FOR

05:38:25.718 --> 05:38:29.055
QUICKLY AS FOR THE LAST FEW

05:38:29.122 --> 05:38:30.823
WORDS -- WE'RE CERTAINLY GOING

05:38:30.890 --> 05:38:32.425
TO TAKE YOU AT YOUR WORD BECAUSE

05:38:32.492 --> 05:38:33.660
THAT WE BELIEVE IN YOUR WORD AND

05:38:33.726 --> 05:38:35.828
YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH --

05:38:35.895 --> 05:38:37.497
THE FOLKS IN THIS PROCESS.

05:38:37.563 --> 05:38:39.599
IT WILL PROBABLY CHANGE BUT I

05:38:39.666 --> 05:38:41.534
THINK IF WE BELIEVE IN THE END

05:38:41.601 --> 05:38:43.102
GOAL YEAH I THINK WE DO SHARE

05:38:43.169 --> 05:38:43.903
THIS.

05:38:43.970 --> 05:38:45.538
THIS IS DEFINITELY WORTH THE THE

05:38:45.605 --> 05:38:48.541
EFFORT SO -- WITH THAT -- MOVED

05:38:48.608 --> 05:38:49.676
THE BILL.

GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE

05:39:01.187 --> 05:39:03.122
BILL BUT I APPRECIATE THE

05:39:03.189 --> 05:39:04.824

05:51:36.842 --> 05:51:38.010
THE COUNTY WANTED TO PRODUCE

05:51:38.076 --> 05:51:39.445

05:51:43.048 --> 05:51:44.216
NINE EIGHT SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

05:51:44.283 --> 05:51:46.051
WHICH WAS RELUCTANTLY ACCEPTED

05:51:46.118 --> 05:51:47.453
AND THEN IN THE END.

05:51:47.519 --> 05:51:48.620
THE COURT RULED IN THE REQUEST

05:51:48.687 --> 05:51:50.956
HERS FAVOR ANYWAY ON SOME OF THE

DISPUTED CATEGORY SO -- THE

05:51:53.358 --> 05:51:54.660
ATTORNEY GOT THEIR ATTORNEYS

05:51:54.726 --> 05:51:56.662
FEES AT RESPECTIVE IRRESPECTIVE

05:51:56.728 --> 05:51:58.197
OF THE NINE NINE EIGHT WHICH IS

05:51:58.263 --> 05:52:00.632
EXACTLY WE THINK HOW THE NINE

05:52:00.699 --> 05:52:01.500
NINE A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

05:52:01.567 --> 05:52:04.136
SHOULD ACT AND IF THEY HAD NOT

05:52:04.203 --> 05:52:05.737
PREVAILED ON THOSE DISPUTED

05:52:05.804 --> 05:52:06.805
CATEGORIES.

05:52:06.872 --> 05:52:08.674
THEY WOULDN'T OF HAD TO COVER

05:52:08.740 --> 05:52:10.776
THE LOCAL AGENCIES FEES -- NO

05:52:10.843 --> 05:52:12.211
ONE WAS CHARGING THAT THIS WAS

05:52:12.277 --> 05:52:13.879
FRIVOLOUS FOR THEM TO PURSUE IT --

05:52:13.946 --> 05:52:15.247
IT WOULD JUST LIMIT THE LOCAL

05:52:15.314 --> 05:52:17.115
AGENCIES COSTS THIS DOESN'T SHIP

05:52:17.182 --> 05:52:18.417
BECAUSE SUCH AS LIMITS LOCAL

05:52:18.484 --> 05:52:19.618
AGENCIES COST.

05:52:19.685 --> 05:52:20.686
THEN THE OTHER POINT WE WANT TO

05:52:20.752 --> 05:52:22.688
PUSH BACK ON IS THAT THE NOTION

05:52:22.754 --> 05:52:24.189
THAT NINE NINE EIGHT SHOULDN'T

05:52:24.256 --> 05:52:26.358
APPLY IN P. R. A. CASES BECAUSE

05:52:26.425 --> 05:52:27.793
THEY'RE NOT LIKE OTHER TYPES OF

05:52:27.860 --> 05:52:29.061
CIVIL LITIGATION.

05:52:29.127 --> 05:52:31.363
THERE WAS A CASE IN TWENTY

05:52:37.469 --> 05:52:39.137
BARKER.

05:52:39.204 --> 05:52:40.005
WHERE WE IN FACT ARGUED THAT P.

05:52:40.072 --> 05:52:40.639
R. A. CASES SHOULD BE GOVERNED

05:52:40.706 --> 05:52:41.940
ONLY BY THE GOVERNMENT CODE PR A

05:52:42.007 --> 05:52:43.408
PROVISIONS FOR PROCESSES IN RICK

05:52:43.475 --> 05:52:46.512
REMEDIES -- BUT BUT WE LOST THAT

05:52:46.578 --> 05:52:48.814
CASE AND SO IT SEEMS PATENTLY

05:52:48.881 --> 05:52:51.650
UNFAIR.

05:52:51.717 --> 05:52:52.918
FOR AT TO ONLY APPLY THE THE

05:52:52.985 --> 05:52:54.186
BURDEN SOME PARTS WITHOUT THE

05:52:54.253 --> 05:52:55.754

TO DENY THE RIGHTS -- THAT -- IN

06:08:08.900 --> 06:08:10.935
MY VIEW ARBITRATION ALREADY DOES

06:08:42.400 --> 06:08:43.968

DRAFTED IS OVERLY BROAD AND WILL

06:10:17.828 --> 06:10:18.963

A COMPANY DOESN'T PAY EVEN

06:10:26.804 --> 06:10:27.305
THOUGH THERE'S A BALLOT FEW

06:10:27.371 --> 06:10:29.173

06:10:39.717 --> 06:10:41.052
THAT'S A CONCERN IF THEY HAVE

SANCTIONS WHERE THEY WOULD

06:11:25.363 --> 06:11:26.764
BASICALLY THE JUDGE COULD ISSUE

06:11:26.831 --> 06:11:27.865
A DEFAULT JUDGMENT AGAINST THE

06:11:27.932 --> 06:11:29.133
COMPANY ALL BECAUSE THERE IS A

06:11:29.200 --> 06:11:30.568

TO BE PAID OR LET'S SAY THAT IN

06:11:34.672 --> 06:11:36.407
IN THE CASE THAT THE COMPANY.

06:11:36.474 --> 06:11:38.142

06:11:41.912 --> 06:11:43.414
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THAT AND

WHILE ARBITRATION STARTED OUT AS

RECEIVED I'VE HAD OTHER

06:14:30.114 --> 06:14:31.282
ARBITRATION BILLS THAT HAVE NOT

06:14:31.348 --> 06:14:34.084
FARED SO WELL USUALLY THEY GET

06:14:34.151 --> 06:14:36.220
WHITTLED DOWN I WILL I'M.

06:14:36.287 --> 06:14:37.788
I WILL THINK HAVE CONSIDERED

06:14:37.855 --> 06:14:39.957
THAT I DID YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT

06:14:40.024 --> 06:14:41.458
WHY WHY.

06:14:41.525 --> 06:14:43.494
I THINK I GOT.

06:14:43.561 --> 06:14:44.361
AS I'VE GONE THROUGH THIS

06:14:44.428 --> 06:14:45.596
PROCESS OF HAVING ARBITRATION

06:14:45.663 --> 06:14:47.298
BILLS AND BACKED UP SO FAR THAN

06:14:47.364 --> 06:14:50.134
JUST THINKING OF IN CONSUMERS

06:14:50.201 --> 06:14:52.970
AND BUSINESSES OR EMPLOYEES.

06:14:53.037 --> 06:14:54.171
BUT YOU MAKE A POINT BECAUSE IT

06:14:54.238 --> 06:14:55.940
IT DID START UP JUST BUSINESSES

06:14:56.006 --> 06:14:58.843
AND BUSINESSES AND ON THE THE

06:14:58.909 --> 06:15:01.145
INITIAL FEDERAL STATUTE.

06:15:01.212 --> 06:15:02.513
AND THE TRUTH IS SAID.

06:15:02.580 --> 06:15:04.682
THAT IF LITIGANTS DON'T WANT THE

06:15:04.748 --> 06:15:06.550
CASE TO PROCEED OR IF THEY FEEL

06:15:06.617 --> 06:15:08.152
THAT THEY'RE GONNA LOSE THEY

06:15:08.219 --> 06:15:10.187
JUST STOP PAYING I MEAN IT'S

06:15:10.254 --> 06:15:12.456
IT'S A IT'S OF HEAVY THUMB ON

06:15:12.523 --> 06:15:13.858
WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE A WISE

06:15:13.924 --> 06:15:15.526
BE THE SCALES OF JUSTICE.

06:15:15.593 --> 06:15:17.761
AND YOUR JAMS PEOPLE IN YOUR

06:15:17.828 --> 06:15:20.364
TRIPLE A BIG THEY WON'T WORK.

06:15:20.431 --> 06:15:22.233
NO TAKING NO LAUNDRY DAY ARE

06:15:22.299 --> 06:15:24.501
JUST ABSOLUTELY I'VE SEEN THIS

06:15:24.568 --> 06:15:26.971
HAPPEN -- YOU YOU GOTTA GET A

06:15:27.037 --> 06:15:28.572
SENSE SAID THAT -- YOU'RE

06:15:28.639 --> 06:15:30.307
WINNING AND THE OTHER SIDE'S

06:15:30.374 --> 06:15:31.809
GOING TO COME UP WITH SOME.

06:15:31.876 --> 06:15:33.344
MONEY TO TO KEEP THE CASE GOING

06:15:33.410 --> 06:15:35.946
THEY DON'T AND SO YOUR STOCK.

06:15:36.013 --> 06:15:38.282
SO ARE I AGREE I THINK ON BOTH

06:15:38.349 --> 06:15:40.417
SIDES I DON'T CARE WHO'S THE

06:15:40.484 --> 06:15:41.819
WHO'S WINNING WHO'S LOSING IT IT

06:15:41.886 --> 06:15:45.256
IS A A TOOL THAT IS BEING USED

06:15:45.322 --> 06:15:47.191
TO CREATE A SERB NIP AGAIN ON

06:15:47.258 --> 06:15:48.259
FAIRNESS.

06:15:48.325 --> 06:15:50.060
IN THE PRIVATE LITIGATION

06:15:50.127 --> 06:15:51.595
PROCESS.

06:15:51.662 --> 06:15:53.998
SO I I WOULD I WOULD NOT

06:15:54.064 --> 06:15:55.299
DISAGREE BUT WE'RE HERE NOW.

06:15:55.366 --> 06:15:57.468
LET'S KEEP THE BILL AT THIS FORM

06:15:57.534 --> 06:15:58.969
AND WE'LL DEAL WITH THAT LATER

06:15:59.036 --> 06:16:01.405
BECAUSE IT'S GETTING LATE.

06:16:01.472 --> 06:16:02.706
CENTER BOARD JUST IF YOU WOULD.

06:16:02.773 --> 06:16:08.479
IT'S IF A IF A IF A A PARTY --

06:16:08.545 --> 06:16:10.681
PAYS TO AVOID ANY OF THE

06:16:10.748 --> 06:16:12.650
CONSEQUENCES OF THAT DOESN'T

06:16:12.716 --> 06:16:15.753
DEPRIVE THEM OF THEIR ABILITY --

06:16:15.819 --> 06:16:18.122
TO CONTEST -- THE THE FEES IS

06:16:18.188 --> 06:16:20.758
THAT CORRECT.

06:16:20.824 --> 06:16:22.059
I DON'T BELIEVE SO I THINK THAT

06:16:22.126 --> 06:16:24.328
FEATURED AS DETERMINED BY JAMS

06:16:24.395 --> 06:16:26.330
AND AND NORMALLY THE PARTIES

06:16:26.397 --> 06:16:28.032
CHOOSE THE ARBITRATION GROUP

06:16:28.098 --> 06:16:30.167
THAT THEY HAVE SO I DON'T.

06:16:30.234 --> 06:16:31.869
AND THEN THE EMPLOYER.

06:16:31.936 --> 06:16:32.903
OR THE BUSINESSES.

06:16:32.970 --> 06:16:34.905
THE THEY SET UP THE ARBITRATION

06:16:34.972 --> 06:16:36.607
CLAUSE SO I DON'T KNOW IF THEY

06:16:36.674 --> 06:16:38.042
CAN LIVE I THINK THAT WHEN WE

06:16:38.108 --> 06:16:39.710
HEARD FROM THE REPRESENTED FROM

06:16:39.777 --> 06:16:41.378
THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE I DON'T

06:16:41.445 --> 06:16:42.913
KNOW IF I'M RESETTING THIS

06:16:42.980 --> 06:16:46.350
ACCURATELY -- THE EXAMPLE IS

06:16:46.417 --> 06:16:49.820
THAT THE IF ONE OF THE

06:16:49.887 --> 06:16:50.354
INDIVIDUALS ARE ONE OF THE

06:16:50.421 --> 06:16:51.388
PARTIES [inaudible]

06:16:51.455 --> 06:16:52.990
OBJECTED.

06:16:53.057 --> 06:16:55.659
AND DID NOT PAY.

06:16:55.726 --> 06:16:56.860
AND THEN ALL THESE PENALTIES

06:16:56.927 --> 06:16:58.662
WOULD ATTACH.

06:16:58.729 --> 06:17:01.131
SO THAT IS A REAL CONCERN.

06:17:01.198 --> 06:17:05.102
IS MY UNDERSTANDING.

06:17:05.169 --> 06:17:06.036
ATTENTION.

06:17:06.103 --> 06:17:07.171
IS HAD A QUESTION FOR THE

06:17:07.237 --> 06:17:09.106
CHAMBER WOULD YOU WANT TO

RESPOND TO IT QUICKLY.

06:17:12.409 --> 06:17:13.544
THAT'S ONE OF THE EXAMPLES OF

06:17:13.610 --> 06:17:14.678
THE THERE COULD BE A VALID FEW

06:17:14.745 --> 06:17:15.846
DISPUTE AT THE INITIATION OF THE

06:17:15.913 --> 06:17:17.548
ARBITRATION AND IF WE DON'T PAY

WITHIN THIRTY DAYS ALL THESE

06:17:18.749 --> 06:17:20.184
HORRIBLE THINGS CAN HAPPEN EVEN

06:17:20.250 --> 06:17:21.452
THOUGH THERE IS A VALID THE

06:17:21.518 --> 06:17:22.219
SPEED AT THE VERY BEGINNING.

06:17:22.286 --> 06:17:23.287
WHEN I'M IS WHAT I'M SAYING

06:17:23.354 --> 06:17:25.155
THOUGH IS THAT THERE MIGHT BE A

BOB MY QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR IS

06:17:35.132 --> 06:17:35.766

06:25:39.816 --> 06:25:41.885
THE 99% WILL REALLY STRUGGLING

06:25:41.952 --> 06:25:43.787

I'M GONNA DEFER TO OUR LABOR

06:26:04.241 --> 06:26:05.775

06:26:09.045 --> 06:26:10.981
WOULD NOT CHANGE THAT CURRENTLY

06:26:11.047 --> 06:26:12.582
IS ALREADY THE SITUATION.

06:26:12.649 --> 06:26:14.551
WITH CITATIONS THAT ARE ISSUED

06:26:14.618 --> 06:26:15.886
BY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER

06:26:15.952 --> 06:26:18.455
PURSUANT TO ELEVEN NINETY SEVEN

06:26:18.522 --> 06:26:18.688

TO PROVE UP THE CASE.

06:26:29.065 --> 06:26:31.368
AFTER A HE OR A DECISION IS

06:26:31.434 --> 06:26:32.903
RENDERED BY THE HEARING OFFICER

06:26:32.969 --> 06:26:34.437
IF THE EMPLOYERS STILL IN

06:26:34.504 --> 06:26:35.805
DISAGREEMENT THEY HAVE THE

06:26:35.872 --> 06:26:37.440
ABILITY TO FILE A WRITTEN

06:26:37.507 --> 06:26:38.875
SUPERIOR COURT.

06:26:38.942 --> 06:26:41.411
IN GET REVIEW OF THAT DECISION

06:26:41.478 --> 06:26:43.013
ON UNDER THE LAW THEY ARE

06:26:43.079 --> 06:26:45.549
REQUIRED TO POST A BOND FOR THE

06:26:45.615 --> 06:26:47.384
AMOUNT OF THE WAGES THAT HAVE

06:26:47.450 --> 06:26:48.885
BEEN FOUND TO BUT NOT THE

06:26:48.952 --> 06:26:50.453
PENALTIES.

06:26:50.520 --> 06:26:52.088
SO IN ORDER TO PUT TO SEEK

06:26:52.155 --> 06:26:54.624
REDRESS -- IN SUPERIOR COURT

06:26:54.691 --> 06:26:57.260
THEY WOULD NEED TO SUBMIT A BOND.

06:26:57.327 --> 06:26:59.429
THAT CURRENTLY IS THE WALL HAD

06:26:59.496 --> 06:27:01.097
IS THAT YES IN SO.

06:27:01.164 --> 06:27:03.133
THIS WOULD THE BILL AS I

06:27:03.199 --> 06:27:05.168
UNDERSTAND IT WOULD STILL.

06:27:05.235 --> 06:27:07.437
LAW WOULD REQUIRE THAT A BOT

06:27:07.504 --> 06:27:09.172
THAT THE BOND INCLUDE THE AMOUNT

06:27:09.239 --> 06:27:10.907
FOR ANY CONTRACT WHICH IS OVER

06:27:10.974 --> 06:27:14.010
AND ABOVE THE MINIMUM WAGE.

06:27:14.077 --> 06:27:16.179
ON THAT WAS FOUND TO SO IT COULD

06:27:16.246 --> 06:27:17.981
INCREMENTALLY INCREASE THE

06:27:18.048 --> 06:27:19.349
AMOUNT OF THE BOND.

06:27:19.416 --> 06:27:21.685
ON FROM THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S

06:27:21.751 --> 06:27:23.653
PERSPECTIVE IN ENFORCEMENT OF

06:27:23.720 --> 06:27:24.988
THE MINIMUM WAGE LAWS.

06:27:25.055 --> 06:27:26.957
OF FREQUENTLY THERE ARE TIMES

06:27:27.023 --> 06:27:29.025
WHERE WE HAVE SITUATIONS WHERE

06:27:29.092 --> 06:27:31.194
THERE'S MINIMUM WAGE MINIMUM

06:27:31.261 --> 06:27:32.662
WITH THIS THE DIFFERENTIAL.

06:27:32.729 --> 06:27:34.864
ABOVE MINIMUM WAGE RIGHT IN SO

06:27:34.931 --> 06:27:37.767
THE WHAT WHAT WE EXPERIENCE IS

06:27:37.834 --> 06:27:39.069
THAT THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE

06:27:39.135 --> 06:27:39.769
WE ARE.

06:27:39.836 --> 06:27:41.471
ABLE TO GET THE MINIMUM WAGE BUT

06:27:41.538 --> 06:27:43.473
THERE ARE OTHER CONTRACT WAGES

06:27:43.540 --> 06:27:45.075
WHICH ARE TWO FOR EXAMPLE FOR

06:27:45.141 --> 06:27:46.977
WORKER WAS MAKING SIXTEEN

06:27:47.043 --> 06:27:48.745
DOLLARS AN HOUR IN RECEIVED NO

06:27:48.812 --> 06:27:53.116
PAY FOR THAT FOR THOSE WAGES.

06:27:53.183 --> 06:27:53.850
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWELVE

06:27:53.917 --> 06:27:54.517
DOLLARS AN HOUR AND FOUR DOLLARS

06:27:54.584 --> 06:27:55.719
AN HOUR THE ONLY WAY THAT THE

06:27:55.785 --> 06:27:57.354
LABOR COMMISSIONER COULD ENFORCE

06:27:57.420 --> 06:27:58.888
THOSE RIGHTS FOR THE EMPLOYEES

06:27:58.955 --> 06:28:00.423
WOULD BE FILING A SEPARATE

06:28:00.490 --> 06:28:01.391
ACTION.

06:28:01.458 --> 06:28:03.927
IN SUPERIOR COURT TO COLLECT

06:28:03.994 --> 06:28:05.228
THAT MONEY ON BEHALF OF THE

06:28:05.295 --> 06:28:07.697
EMPLOYEES SO IN ESSENCE.

06:28:07.764 --> 06:28:09.432
BY ALLOWING FOR THE CONTRACT

06:28:09.499 --> 06:28:12.202
WHICH IS TO BE COLLECTED WE

06:28:12.268 --> 06:28:13.670
WOULD BE ABLE TO DO IN.

06:28:13.737 --> 06:28:15.639
ONE RECEDING RATHER THAN.

06:28:15.705 --> 06:28:16.573
TO IF I COULD JUST ADD TO THAT

06:28:16.640 --> 06:28:19.376
THROUGH THE CHAIR.

06:28:19.442 --> 06:28:20.877
I WOULD ACTUALLY THINK THIS

06:28:20.944 --> 06:28:21.978
MIGHT BE.

06:28:22.045 --> 06:28:23.980
A PREFERRED PATH FOR EMPLOYERS

06:28:24.047 --> 06:28:25.615
AS WELL BECAUSE IT CONSOLIDATES

06:28:25.682 --> 06:28:27.217
THE CASE IT DOESN'T REMOVE THEIR

06:28:27.283 --> 06:28:29.285
DUE PROCESS RIGHT TO APPEAL TO

06:28:29.352 --> 06:28:30.754
SUPERIOR COURT IF THEY FEEL THEY

06:28:30.820 --> 06:28:31.721
HAVEN'T.

06:28:31.788 --> 06:28:33.857
GOTTEN A FAIR SHAKE IN FRONT OF

06:28:33.923 --> 06:28:34.624
THE LABOR COMMISSIONER.

06:28:34.691 --> 06:28:36.393
BUT IT.

06:28:36.459 --> 06:28:37.827
THE DISPUTE IS AROUND THE

06:28:37.894 --> 06:28:40.063
PAYMENT OF THE SAME SET OF WAGES

06:28:40.130 --> 06:28:42.032
CURRENT LAW SAYS TO GO AFTER

06:28:42.098 --> 06:28:44.267
THAT DIFFERENTIAL.

06:28:44.334 --> 06:28:46.236

THIS STATE SOME INSURANCE POLICY.

06:30:37.147 --> 06:30:37.747
THAT.

06:30:37.814 --> 06:30:40.483
ARE ENVIRONMENTAL AND WORKER

06:30:40.550 --> 06:30:42.552
HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS.

06:30:42.619 --> 06:30:44.687
THAT DEPEND ON FEDERAL

06:30:44.754 --> 06:30:47.924
REGULATORY REGIMES TO GIVE THEM

06:30:47.991 --> 06:30:48.224
[inaudible]

06:30:48.291 --> 06:30:51.161
ENFORCEABILITY -- IF THOSE

06:30:51.227 --> 06:30:53.363
FEDERAL REGULATIONS ARE ROLLED

06:30:53.429 --> 06:30:55.498
BACK AS WE'VE SEEN DOZENS AND

06:30:55.565 --> 06:30:57.233
DOZENS OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

06:30:57.300 --> 06:31:00.804
ALREADY -- YOU WOULDN'T UNDER

06:31:00.870 --> 06:31:02.305
CUT CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY

06:31:02.372 --> 06:31:04.407

06:31:07.043 --> 06:31:08.545
WE'VE SEEN.

06:31:08.611 --> 06:31:10.380
AYE AYE BUT IS IT THREE YEARS IN

06:31:10.446 --> 06:31:12.649
TWO MONTHS SO WE'RE WE'RE NOT --

06:31:12.715 --> 06:31:14.784
WE'RE NOT THROUGH THIS IS PRETTY

06:31:14.851 --> 06:31:15.351
TIME BUT THE UNCERTAINTY IS

06:31:15.418 --> 06:31:16.786
CREATING.

06:31:16.853 --> 06:31:18.454
IN THE MARKET PLACE -- FOR

06:31:18.521 --> 06:31:20.356
ENVIRONMENT FOR WORKERS IS

06:31:20.423 --> 06:31:22.158
SIGNIFICANT SO MY HOPE IS THAT

06:31:22.225 --> 06:31:23.326
WE CAN EVENTUALLY ACHIEVE SOME

06:31:23.393 --> 06:31:24.460
CONSENSUS HERE WITH THE BUSINESS

06:31:24.527 --> 06:31:26.262
COMMUNITY YOU STILL HAVE SOME

06:31:26.329 --> 06:31:27.664
CONCERNS ABOUT THE MEASURE BUT

06:31:27.730 --> 06:31:29.165
ACTUALLY FIND A WORK PRODUCT

06:31:29.232 --> 06:31:30.500
HERE THAT WILL.

06:31:30.567 --> 06:31:32.068
AT THE VERY LEAST.

06:31:32.135 --> 06:31:33.736
JUST PRESERVE.

06:31:33.803 --> 06:31:35.104
THE BASELINE STANDARDS AS WE HAD

06:31:35.171 --> 06:31:36.506
THEM AT THE END OF THE LAST

06:31:36.573 --> 06:31:38.675
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION -- AND

06:31:38.741 --> 06:31:39.742
HOPEFULLY WE CAN FIND A LITTLE

06:31:39.809 --> 06:31:42.245
MORE STABLE FUTURE FORWARD SO.

06:31:42.312 --> 06:31:43.279
WE'VE GOT SOME GREAT SUPPORT

06:31:43.346 --> 06:31:45.081
HERE -- OF THE FOR TO THEM ON

06:31:45.148 --> 06:31:46.583
THE DETAILS OF FOR THE MOMENT

06:31:46.649 --> 06:31:49.052
BUT IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS I

06:31:49.118 --> 06:31:50.286
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR HALF OF

06:31:50.353 --> 06:31:52.889
THANK YOU WITNESSES IN SUPPORT

06:31:52.956 --> 06:31:54.157
TWO MINUTES EACH IF YOU WOULD.

06:31:54.224 --> 06:31:55.225
GOOD EVENING AT LESS THAN TWO

06:31:55.291 --> 06:31:57.026
MINUTES GOOD EVENING CAM DELFINO

06:31:57.093 --> 06:31:59.062
WITH DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE -- AS

06:31:59.128 --> 06:32:00.830
ALREADY HAS BEEN DESCRIBED -- IN

06:32:00.897 --> 06:32:02.899
THE LAST THREE YEARS WE'VE HAD A

06:32:02.966 --> 06:32:04.601
BETTER ROLE ON SLIDE OF

06:32:04.667 --> 06:32:06.336
ROLLBACKS IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND

06:32:06.402 --> 06:32:08.338
WORKER SAFETY PROTECTIONS -- A

06:32:08.404 --> 06:32:10.306
LARGE NUMBER OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS

06:32:10.373 --> 06:32:11.474
IN WHICH ROLL BACKS OCCURRED

06:32:11.541 --> 06:32:12.508
WITHOUT ANY PUBLIC COMMENT AND

06:32:12.575 --> 06:32:13.710
NOTICE.

06:32:13.776 --> 06:32:14.978
SB ONE IS REALLY JUST A SIMPLE

06:32:15.044 --> 06:32:16.980
FIX TO THE PROBLEM IT PUTS IN

06:32:17.046 --> 06:32:18.715
PLACE A REQUIREMENT IN A PROCESS

06:32:18.781 --> 06:32:20.450
FOR THE STATE AGENCIES TO ASSESS

06:32:20.516 --> 06:32:21.584
IF THESE CHANGES REDUCE

06:32:21.651 --> 06:32:22.652
PROTECTIONS.

06:32:22.719 --> 06:32:24.621
AND THEN DETERMINE THE BEST WAY

06:32:24.687 --> 06:32:25.722
TO RESTORE THOSE LAWS

06:32:25.788 --> 06:32:27.724
PROTECTIONS WITHIN THE EXISTING

06:32:27.790 --> 06:32:29.559
REGULATORY AUTHORITY OF THAT

06:32:29.626 --> 06:32:30.827
STATE AGENCY.

06:32:30.894 --> 06:32:32.428
SO THIS JUST MEANS THAT IF CLEAN

06:32:32.495 --> 06:32:33.963
AIR RULES OR WEEKEND THE A. R.

06:32:34.030 --> 06:32:35.398
B. WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND

06:32:35.465 --> 06:32:37.467
THEN DETERMINE IF AND HOW THEY

06:32:37.533 --> 06:32:38.735
SHOULD RESTORE THOSE WEAKENED

06:32:38.801 --> 06:32:39.903
PROTECTIONS.

06:32:39.969 --> 06:32:41.070
IF CLEAN WATER RULES ARE WEEKEND

06:32:41.137 --> 06:32:42.572
THE STATE WATER BOARD WOULD DO

06:36:49.785 --> 06:36:50.653
REGIME.

06:36:50.720 --> 06:36:53.389
BUT HOW THE BILL IN SOME AREAS

06:36:53.456 --> 06:36:54.857
PROPOSES TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL.

06:36:54.924 --> 06:36:56.592

06:37:10.573 --> 06:37:11.741
FIRST WE DISAGREE WITH THE

THE APA'S DUE PROCESS AND NOTICE

06:37:20.917 --> 06:37:22.151

06:37:22.218 --> 06:37:23.319
THE NOTICE AND COMMENT PROVIDE

06:37:31.260 --> 06:37:31.761
BACKS.

06:37:31.827 --> 06:37:32.895
BUT THE BILL TAKES AN

06:37:32.962 --> 06:37:34.063
EXTRAORDINARY STEP OF

06:37:34.130 --> 06:37:35.598
ELIMINATING ALL NOTICE AND

06:37:35.665 --> 06:37:36.465

THAT WILL BE PROPAGATED.

06:37:45.107 --> 06:37:46.842
IT THEN GOES EVEN FURTHER BY

06:37:46.909 --> 06:37:48.211
ALLOWING THE AGENCY TO DO SO

06:37:48.277 --> 06:37:49.645
UNDER EMERGENCY RULE MAKING

06:37:49.712 --> 06:37:52.048

WE HAVE PROPOSED REINSTATING THE

ADDITION OF PRIVATE RIGHTS OF

STATED INTENT.

06:38:18.341 --> 06:38:20.209
OF PRESERVING THE STATUS QUO IT

06:38:20.276 --> 06:38:22.411
CREATES A DUPLICATE OF PROCESS --

06:38:22.478 --> 06:38:24.347
THAT IS A NECESSARY TO PRESERVE

06:38:24.413 --> 06:38:26.382
CITIZENS RIGHT TO SUE BECAUSE AS

THEY ARE HIGHER THAN THE FEDERAL

06:38:48.437 --> 06:38:49.438
COUNTERPART.

06:38:49.505 --> 06:38:50.339
CREATING A NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF

06:38:50.406 --> 06:38:52.041
ACTION WOULD CREATE A DUAL TRACK

06:38:52.108 --> 06:38:53.276
SYSTEM WHERE FEDERAL COURTS IN

06:38:53.342 --> 06:38:55.344
CALIFORNIA AND STATE COURTS IN

06:38:55.411 --> 06:38:56.245
CALIFORNIA COULD END UP

06:38:56.312 --> 06:38:58.047
INTERPRETING THE EXACT SAME

06:38:58.114 --> 06:38:59.315
STANDARD IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS.

06:38:59.382 --> 06:39:00.850
IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE MY LAST

06:39:00.916 --> 06:39:01.951
POINT REAL QUICK.

06:39:02.018 --> 06:39:04.186
THAT WE HAVE LEFT INTO THE BILL

06:39:04.253 --> 06:39:05.821

THOSE BACK IN THANK YOU THANK

06:39:11.894 --> 06:39:12.428
YOU.

06:39:12.495 --> 06:39:13.596
NEXT WITNESS PLEASE TOO MANY

06:39:13.663 --> 06:39:15.197
NOEL KRAMER'S OF THE CALIFORNIA

06:39:15.264 --> 06:39:16.499
FARM BUREAU FEDERATION I WANT TO

06:39:16.565 --> 06:39:17.933
EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION FOR THE

06:39:18.000 --> 06:39:19.168
ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WE'VE BEEN

06:39:19.235 --> 06:39:21.971
HAVING WITH -- THE AUTHOR STAFF.

06:39:22.038 --> 06:39:24.173
WE HAVE OFFERED AMENDMENTS THAT

06:39:24.240 --> 06:39:27.310
IF TAKEN IN FULL WOULD ALLOW US

06:39:27.376 --> 06:39:28.411
TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION.

06:39:28.477 --> 06:39:29.679
I'M UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE NOT

06:39:29.745 --> 06:39:31.147
COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON THOSE

06:39:31.213 --> 06:39:31.814
YET SO I WANT TO POINT OUT SOME

06:39:31.881 --> 06:39:34.283
OF OUR SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH

06:39:34.350 --> 06:39:36.252
THE THE BILL AND PRINT --

06:39:36.319 --> 06:39:38.154
PRIMARILY THE ENDANGERED SPECIES

06:39:38.220 --> 06:39:40.289
ACT PROVISION IS VERY

06:39:40.356 --> 06:39:42.725
PROBLEMATIC IT GOES -- IN OUR

06:39:42.792 --> 06:39:44.226
MIND ABOVE AND BEYOND JUST

06:39:44.293 --> 06:39:46.162
LOCKING IN PLACE -- HISTORIC

06:39:46.228 --> 06:39:48.230
PROTECTIONS AND GETS DOWN INTO

06:39:48.297 --> 06:39:50.399
VERY SPECIFIC PERMIT THE

06:39:50.466 --> 06:39:51.801
IMPLEMENTATION OF ENDANGERED

06:39:51.867 --> 06:39:53.569
SPECIES ACT THROUGH THE ISSUANCE

06:39:53.636 --> 06:39:55.237
OF PERMITS.

06:39:55.304 --> 06:39:57.173
IT ALSO HAS SIGNIFICANT IMPACT

06:39:57.239 --> 06:39:58.574
ON THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR WATER

06:39:58.641 --> 06:40:00.209
SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE

06:40:00.276 --> 06:40:02.511
CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS

06:40:02.578 --> 06:40:03.346
OF THAT WOULD HAVE.

06:40:03.412 --> 06:40:04.847
I SINCE THIS IS THE JUDICIARY

06:40:04.914 --> 06:40:05.848
COMMITTEE THOUGH I DID WANT TO

06:40:05.915 --> 06:40:07.717
TALK ABOUT -- SOME LEGAL

06:40:07.783 --> 06:40:09.752
LIABILITIES THAT SECTION ONE OF

06:40:09.819 --> 06:40:10.953
THE BILL CREATES WHICH WAS --

06:40:11.020 --> 06:40:12.788
RECENTLY ADDED TO THE TO THE

06:40:12.855 --> 06:40:13.456
BILL.

06:40:13.522 --> 06:40:15.424
I THINK THE ANALYSIS MENTIONS

06:40:15.491 --> 06:40:17.326
I'M AN EXAMPLE OF IF INDIA WERE

06:40:17.393 --> 06:40:19.195
TO PASS A LAW BANNING THE SALE

06:40:19.261 --> 06:40:21.197
OF COW IS IN THE FUTURE THAT

06:40:21.263 --> 06:40:23.132
THAT COULD PREVENT THE SALE OF

06:40:23.199 --> 06:40:25.134
HOUSING CAL IN CALIFORNIA.

06:40:25.201 --> 06:40:26.569
I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GREAT

06:40:26.635 --> 06:40:27.737
EXAMPLE BECAUSE COWS AREN'T

06:40:27.803 --> 06:40:29.472
WILDLIFE BUT I'LL GIVE A HANDFUL

06:40:29.538 --> 06:40:31.574
OF ALMOST LIMITLESS EXAMPLES

06:40:31.640 --> 06:40:33.442
ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT.

06:40:33.509 --> 06:40:35.544
THIS LANGUAGE PROVE THAT SAYS TO

06:40:35.611 --> 06:40:37.313
TRANSPORT CELL RECEIVE ACQUIRE

06:40:37.380 --> 06:40:39.281
PURCHASE ANY FISH WILDLIFE OR

06:40:39.348 --> 06:40:40.716
PLANT TAKEN POSSESS TRANSPORTERS

06:40:40.783 --> 06:40:42.952
SOLD IN VIOLATION OF ANY LAW OR

06:40:43.018 --> 06:40:45.321
REGULATION OF ANY OTHER STATE.

06:40:45.388 --> 06:40:46.789
OR IN VIOLATION OF ANY FOREIGN

06:40:46.856 --> 06:40:48.591
LAW SO IT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE

06:40:48.657 --> 06:40:49.558
PROHIBITED.

06:40:49.625 --> 06:40:51.927
SO FOR EXAMPLE LOUISIANA HAS A

06:40:51.994 --> 06:40:54.130
LAW THAT SAYS YOU CANNOT CUT

06:40:54.196 --> 06:40:56.265
TREES ON LAND WHETHER IT'S

06:40:56.332 --> 06:41:00.636
PUBLIC OR PRIVATE WITHIN FIVE

06:41:00.703 --> 06:41:01.270
FEET OF SEA LEVEL.

06:41:01.337 --> 06:41:02.471
SO THAT WOULD MEAN THAT

06:41:02.538 --> 06:41:03.706
LANDOWNERS IN THE DELTA WOULD BE

06:41:03.773 --> 06:41:05.474
PROHIBITED FROM CUTTING TREES

06:41:05.541 --> 06:41:06.442
AND REMOVING THEM FROM THEIR

06:41:06.509 --> 06:41:08.344
PROPERTY IN CALIFORNIA WHERE SB

06:41:08.411 --> 06:41:10.212
ONE TO PASS.

06:41:10.279 --> 06:41:12.047
UP WE USE LATE SEASON GOOSE

06:41:12.114 --> 06:41:14.817
HUNTING IN CALIFORNIA TO PREVENT.

06:41:14.884 --> 06:41:16.619
CROP DAMAGE.

06:41:16.685 --> 06:41:17.586
THAT WOULD BE PROHIBITED BECAUSE

06:41:17.653 --> 06:41:19.455
NEW HAMPSHIRE HAS A PROHIBITION

06:41:19.522 --> 06:41:22.091
OF HUNTING AFTER JANUARY SIX

06:41:22.158 --> 06:41:23.592
MEAN THE LIST GOES ON AND ON

06:41:23.659 --> 06:41:24.727
THANK YOU TO WERE VERY CONCERNED

06:41:24.794 --> 06:41:25.728

COMMENT PERIOD PERHAPS AND THEN

06:42:19.448 --> 06:42:21.617
THERE WAS THE QUESTION OF THE

06:42:21.684 --> 06:42:23.052
ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT.

06:42:23.118 --> 06:42:24.086
AND I THINK THE LEGAL

06:42:24.153 --> 06:42:27.089

CRACK AT AND THEN PASS IT OVER

06:42:36.866 --> 06:42:39.268
BUT I I'D I THINK THE THE

06:42:39.335 --> 06:42:42.204
CONCERN ABOUT COMMENT PERIOD.

06:42:42.271 --> 06:42:44.139

INPUT IMPLEMENTING THIS STUFF

06:42:49.512 --> 06:42:51.046
AND SO O GIVE SOME LEAD TIME TO

06:42:51.113 --> 06:42:52.348
INDUSTRY AND OTHERS HAVE TO

06:42:57.686 --> 06:42:59.221
SORT OF DISCLOSURE AND

06:42:59.288 --> 06:43:01.390
TRANSPARENCY IN ABILITY REVIEW

06:43:01.457 --> 06:43:04.393

06:43:04.460 --> 06:43:05.861
UNDERLYING PREMISE THE BILL

06:43:05.928 --> 06:43:06.862
THOUGH IS THAT.

06:43:06.929 --> 06:43:08.697
ALL THE REGULATIONS THAT WE'RE

06:43:08.764 --> 06:43:09.798
TALKING ABOUT HERE I'VE ALREADY

06:43:09.865 --> 06:43:11.433
GONE THROUGH AN ENTIRE APA

06:43:11.500 --> 06:43:14.270
NOTICE AND COMMENT PROCESS SO --

06:43:14.336 --> 06:43:16.338
THESE HAVE BEEN VETTED ALREADY

06:43:16.405 --> 06:43:18.240
IT'S IT'S THE ROLL BACK THAT

06:43:18.307 --> 06:43:19.575
WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT ON THE

06:43:19.642 --> 06:43:21.210
ENDANGERED SPECIES ISSUE I THINK

06:43:21.277 --> 06:43:22.511
THERE ARE THERE ARE THINGS WE

06:43:22.578 --> 06:43:23.379
CAN.

06:43:23.445 --> 06:43:25.281
LOOK AT THEIR AYE AYE HI I DON'T

06:43:25.347 --> 06:43:27.216
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT THE PATH

06:43:27.283 --> 06:43:29.351
IS BUT I'LL I'LL LET MY ADVISER

06:43:29.418 --> 06:43:31.387
HERE COMMENT MORE THERE AND THEN

06:43:31.453 --> 06:43:33.889
TO THE TO THIS ADDITION THIS

06:43:33.956 --> 06:43:35.524
SECTION ONE THAT WAS REFERRED TO

06:43:35.591 --> 06:43:36.191
JUST NOW ABOUT THE

06:43:36.258 --> 06:43:37.760
TRANSPORTATION SALE.

06:43:37.826 --> 06:43:40.763
OF FISH WILDLIFE PLANTS I THINK

06:43:40.829 --> 06:43:42.698
WHAT WAS UNDERLYING THAT WAS A

06:43:42.765 --> 06:43:46.268
CONCERN ABOUT -- ILLEGAL SALES

06:43:46.335 --> 06:43:48.938
OF ENDANGERED TROPHY HUNTED

06:43:49.004 --> 06:43:51.340
SPECIES THAT HAVE BEEN BIG ISSUE

06:43:51.407 --> 06:43:52.908
INTERNATIONALLY AFTER THE

06:43:52.975 --> 06:43:55.277
ADMINISTRATION DECIDED -- TO NO

06:43:55.344 --> 06:43:57.146
LONGER UPHOLD THE BAN ON

06:43:57.212 --> 06:43:59.415
IMPORTED -- AFRICAN DANGER

06:43:59.481 --> 06:44:02.117
SPECIES AND SO -- I THINK WE'RE

06:44:02.184 --> 06:44:03.652
OPEN TO TO LOOKING THROUGH THE

06:44:03.719 --> 06:44:05.287
MECHANICS THERE AND IF IT IS

06:44:05.354 --> 06:44:07.056
OVERLY BROAD OR THERE SHOULD OF

06:44:07.122 --> 06:44:08.023
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE I THINK

06:44:08.090 --> 06:44:09.391
THAT'S A GOOD AREA TO SPEND SOME

06:44:09.458 --> 06:44:10.926
TIME ON BUT I DON'T SPEAK TOO

06:44:10.993 --> 06:44:16.432
FAR TO TURN OUT OF TURN OVER --

06:44:16.498 --> 06:44:19.969
TO THE YEAH MISTER FINO OKAY.

06:44:20.035 --> 06:44:20.903
WITH RESPECT TO THE ENDANGERED

06:44:20.970 --> 06:44:22.438
SPECIES PROVISIONS THAT THE

06:44:22.504 --> 06:44:24.173
ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED BY -- IS

06:44:24.239 --> 06:44:26.875
CREAMERS -- THE ACTUALLY THE THE

06:44:26.942 --> 06:44:28.611
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT

06:44:28.677 --> 06:44:31.814
RIGHTLY SO THAT -- HOW YOU

06:44:31.880 --> 06:44:33.048
DEFINE BASS?

06:44:33.115 --> 06:44:36.151
AND HOW YOU DEFINE STRINGENCY IS

06:44:36.218 --> 06:44:38.287
LEFT UP TO THE END UP TO THE

06:44:38.354 --> 06:44:39.355
AGENCY AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN

06:44:39.421 --> 06:44:41.423
THAT PROVISIONS ARE FROZEN IN

06:44:41.490 --> 06:44:43.425
TIME OR SCIENCE IS FROZEN IN

06:44:43.492 --> 06:44:44.293
TIME.

06:44:44.360 --> 06:44:45.995
SO -- I THINK THAT THAT ANSWERS

06:44:46.061 --> 06:44:47.529
THAT QUESTION WITH RESPECT TO

06:44:47.596 --> 06:44:49.131
THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE ISSUE.

06:44:49.198 --> 06:44:50.099
THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS PUT INTO

06:44:50.165 --> 06:44:51.967
SECTION ONE IS ACTUALLY TAKEN

06:44:52.034 --> 06:44:53.702
AND PRETTY MUCH DIRECTLY OUT OF

06:44:53.769 --> 06:44:55.304
THE LACEY ACT WHICH IS A FEDERAL

06:44:55.371 --> 06:44:57.439
ACTIVE PROHIBITS ON THE

06:44:57.506 --> 06:44:58.474
IMPORTATION.

06:44:58.540 --> 06:45:00.709
OF ANIMAL ANIMALS OR ANIMAL

06:45:00.776 --> 06:45:02.011
PARTS IN VIOLATION OF

06:45:02.077 --> 06:45:04.546
INTERNATIONAL LAW -- OR LAWS OF

06:45:04.613 --> 06:45:07.049
OTHER COUNTRIES -- AND SO BUT

06:45:07.116 --> 06:45:08.684
WITH THE POINT THAT THE THAT NO

06:45:08.751 --> 06:45:10.119
WELL NOW THAT MISS CREAMERS MADE

06:45:10.185 --> 06:45:11.754
I THINK IS A DECENT ONE IN THE

06:45:11.820 --> 06:45:13.555
SENSE OF WE CAN CERTAINLY ADD

06:45:13.622 --> 06:45:15.324
LANGUAGE THAT MAKES IT CLEAR.

06:45:15.391 --> 06:45:17.493
THAT IT'S THE SOURCING ISSUE SO

06:45:17.559 --> 06:45:20.195
THAT YOU CANNOT ACQUIRE -- AN

06:45:20.262 --> 06:45:22.531
ITEM IN IMPORTED INTO CALIFORNIA

06:45:22.598 --> 06:45:24.967
IN A IT BE IN VIOLATION OF THE

STUDENT HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND I

06:54:48.330 --> 06:54:50.265
KNOW FIRST HAND WHY THIS BILL IS

06:54:50.332 --> 06:54:52.434
NECESSARY.

06:54:52.500 --> 06:54:54.269
DURING MY SOPHOMORE YEAR I WAS

06:54:54.336 --> 06:54:55.904

FROM NIGHTMARES AND PANIC

06:55:02.043 --> 06:55:03.178
ATTACKS.

06:55:03.245 --> 06:55:04.779
I WAS SCARED TO BE ON CAMPUS

06:55:04.846 --> 06:55:06.014
BECAUSE MY RAPIST AND HIS

06:55:06.081 --> 06:55:07.415

06:55:07.482 --> 06:55:08.750

06:55:21.229 --> 06:55:23.398
OF THE INVESTIGATION.

06:55:23.465 --> 06:55:24.733
I UNDERSTOOD THAT THE SCHOOL WAS

06:55:24.799 --> 06:55:25.900
SUPPOSED TO COMPLETE THE

06:55:25.967 --> 06:55:27.936

06:55:28.003 --> 06:55:28.903

06:55:28.970 --> 06:55:30.438
BUT THERE ARE EXTENSIONS WHICH

06:55:30.505 --> 06:55:32.207
PROLONG THE PROCESS.

06:55:32.274 --> 06:55:34.509
IT WASN'T UNTIL ABOUT SIX MONTHS

06:55:34.576 --> 06:55:36.378

06:55:39.648 --> 06:55:41.683
DETERMINED THAT MY CLAIM AGAINST

06:55:41.750 --> 06:55:44.219
MY RAPIST WAS SUBSTANTIATED.

06:55:44.286 --> 06:55:46.521

SOME OF THE WITNESSES.

06:56:16.685 --> 06:56:18.053
MANY OF THE QUESTIONS WERE

06:56:18.119 --> 06:56:19.354
INVASIVE -- RELEVANT AND

06:56:19.421 --> 06:56:22.824

06:56:24.592 --> 06:56:25.794
DISGUSTING THAT I CAN'T EVEN

TALK ABOUT THEM.

06:56:28.830 --> 06:56:30.899

06:56:46.881 --> 06:56:47.916
THESE ACCOMMODATIONS ARE

06:56:47.982 --> 06:56:50.118

07:01:08.276 --> 07:01:11.779
GENERALLY THE BILL I JUST HAVE

07:01:11.846 --> 07:01:14.582
SOME SPECIFIC ISSUES WITH THAT --

07:01:14.649 --> 07:01:16.751
I'M CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY I HAVE

07:01:16.818 --> 07:01:17.852
TWO DAUGHTERS WHO WOULD

07:01:17.919 --> 07:01:19.687
CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITIES ONE OF

07:01:19.754 --> 07:01:21.189
WHOM WAS A VICTIM OF SEXUAL

07:01:21.255 --> 07:01:23.958
ASSAULT -- OUR ORGANIZATION

07:01:24.025 --> 07:01:25.760
ADVOCATES FOR FAIRNESS WE DON'T

07:01:25.827 --> 07:01:27.328
TRY TO DENY VICTIMS RIGHTS ARE

07:01:27.395 --> 07:01:29.964
PROTECTIONS THAT'S NOT OUR THING.

07:01:30.031 --> 07:01:32.333
I SERVED ON IN AB A TASK FORCE

07:01:32.400 --> 07:01:34.335
WITH VICTIMS ADVOCATES AND WE

07:01:34.402 --> 07:01:35.870
WERE ABLE TO COME UP WITH.

07:01:35.937 --> 07:01:38.072
A BEST PRACTICES TO WHICH WE ALL

07:01:38.139 --> 07:01:41.209
AGREED WE THERE WAS A CONSENSUS --

07:01:41.275 --> 07:01:42.910
I JUST HAVE IS.

07:01:42.977 --> 07:01:44.646
FEW SPECIFIC ISSUES WITH THE

07:01:44.712 --> 07:01:45.747
BILL.

07:01:45.813 --> 07:01:48.149
UP FIRST THAT IT REQUIRES TRAUMA

07:01:48.216 --> 07:01:50.318
INFORMED INVESTIGATIONS AND

07:01:50.385 --> 07:01:51.919
HEARINGS.

07:01:51.986 --> 07:01:53.488
I THINK IT'S COMPLETELY

07:01:53.554 --> 07:01:54.756
APPROPRIATE TO USE TRAUMA

07:01:54.822 --> 07:01:57.125
INFORMED PROCESSES TO INTERVIEW.

07:01:57.191 --> 07:01:58.292
SOMEONE THAT COMES FORWARD AS

07:01:58.359 --> 07:01:59.427
THE VICTIM.

07:01:59.494 --> 07:02:01.162
THEY'RE BASED IN COGNITIVE

07:02:01.229 --> 07:02:02.897
THERAPY AND THEY ENCOURAGE

07:02:02.964 --> 07:02:05.333
REPORTING AND DON'T INTIMIDATE

07:02:05.400 --> 07:02:06.901
THE PERSON WHEN THEY'RE TRYING

07:02:06.968 --> 07:02:08.069
TO TELL THEIR STORY.

07:02:08.136 --> 07:02:10.171
PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE HOWEVER

07:02:10.238 --> 07:02:11.739
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THE

07:02:11.806 --> 07:02:13.741
TRAINING IS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE

07:02:13.808 --> 07:02:17.145
DIRECTIONS TO DISCOUNT OR IGNORE

07:02:17.211 --> 07:02:18.846
CERTAIN BEHAVIOR.

07:02:18.913 --> 07:02:20.314
SUCH AS AS A SIDE EFFECT OF

07:02:20.381 --> 07:02:23.184
TRAUMA SUCH AS A COMPLAINANT

07:02:23.251 --> 07:02:25.386
MISREPRESENTING OR TELLING

07:02:25.453 --> 07:02:26.954
INCONSISTENT STORIES.

07:02:27.021 --> 07:02:28.956
BEHAVING AND CONSISTENTLY WITH

07:02:29.023 --> 07:02:30.191
HAVING BEEN OF SALTED.

07:02:30.258 --> 07:02:32.393
NOW THOSE ISSUES COULD BE AN

07:02:32.460 --> 07:02:33.761
EFFECTIVE TRAUMA.

07:02:33.828 --> 07:02:35.763
BUT THEY ALSO COULD HAVE OTHER

07:02:35.830 --> 07:02:37.765
CAUSES ORMOTIVATION AND OUR

07:02:37.832 --> 07:02:40.635
CONCERN IS THAT SCHOOLS HAVE

07:02:40.702 --> 07:02:43.805
BEEN JUST ENTIRELY THROWING OUT

07:02:43.871 --> 07:02:45.940
THIS WHOLE CATEGORY OF EVIDENCE

07:02:46.007 --> 07:02:47.742
RATHER THAN TAKING IT IN.

07:02:47.809 --> 07:02:50.411
AND CONSIDERING WHETHER IT IS IN

07:02:50.478 --> 07:02:53.081
FACT THE RESULT OF TRAUMA OR IS

07:02:53.147 --> 07:02:56.284
PERHAPS SOME OTHER MOTIVATION --

07:02:56.350 --> 07:02:57.919
IN FACT UC SANTA BARBARA HAD

07:02:57.985 --> 07:02:59.887
JUST RECENTLY HAD A DECISION

07:02:59.954 --> 07:03:02.757
THAT SAYS THAT THE EVALUATION

07:03:02.824 --> 07:03:04.992
WAS IMPROPERLY BASED ON THE

07:03:05.059 --> 07:03:07.228
TRAUMA INFORMED APPROACH -- AND

07:03:07.295 --> 07:03:09.430
THIS POOR POST ONE SIXTY NINE

07:03:09.497 --> 07:03:11.065
WORKING GROUP THEY AGREE THEY

07:03:11.132 --> 07:03:13.267
SAID THE EXACT SAME THING YOU

07:03:13.334 --> 07:03:14.736
DECISION MAKERS MUST BE ABLE TO

07:03:14.802 --> 07:03:16.370
EVALUATE THE EVIDENCE AND

07:03:16.437 --> 07:03:18.639
DETERMINED AS A QUESTION OF FACT.

07:03:18.706 --> 07:03:20.975
AND NOT IGNORE A CATEGORY OF

07:03:21.042 --> 07:03:23.211
EVIDENCE -- ANOTHER THING WE'RE

07:03:23.277 --> 07:03:24.545
CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT THE

07:03:24.612 --> 07:03:27.148
RACIAL IMPLICATIONS PERTAIN ONLY

07:03:27.215 --> 07:03:28.182
TO VICTIMS.

07:03:28.249 --> 07:03:30.718
OF MINORITIES WE'RE SEEING A LOT

07:03:30.785 --> 07:03:32.253
WE HAVE FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE

07:03:32.320 --> 07:03:33.521
THAT HAVE COME TO US WE'RE

07:03:33.588 --> 07:03:35.289
SEEING A LOT OF MINORITIES LOWER

07:03:35.356 --> 07:03:36.657
INCOME STUDENTS BEING.

07:03:36.724 --> 07:03:38.359
ACCUSED AND CAN'T AFFORD

07:03:38.426 --> 07:03:40.895
ATTORNEYS TO VINDICATE THEIR

07:03:40.962 --> 07:03:42.697
pPROBLEM.

07:03:42.764 --> 07:03:45.333
THE LAST THING IS THE S. BEFORE

07:03:45.399 --> 07:03:46.267
NINETY THREE DENIES BOTH TE

07:03:46.334 --> 07:03:47.401
LIFE HEARING AND A CROSS

EXAMINATION BY A PARTY'S ADVISER.

07:03:50.371 --> 07:03:52.907
THIS IS IN DIRECT CONTRADICTION

07:03:52.974 --> 07:03:54.475
TO SEVERAL CALIFORNIA HELLIP

07:03:54.542 --> 07:03:56.711
COURT DECISIONS IN THE LAST TWO

07:03:56.778 --> 07:03:59.113
YEARS THAT SAY YOU CANNOT HAVE A

07:03:59.180 --> 07:04:00.882
SINGLE INVESTIGATOR PROCESS AND

07:06:01.168 --> 07:06:02.103
REFUSING TO INTERVIEW

07:06:02.169 --> 07:06:03.938
EXONERATING WITNESSES AND

07:06:04.005 --> 07:06:05.706
FAILING TO COLLECT ANY EVIDENCE

07:06:05.773 --> 07:06:07.341
FROM THE ACCUSER OR WITNESSES

07:06:07.408 --> 07:06:08.709
THE SINGLE INVESTIGATOR HAD

07:06:08.776 --> 07:06:10.645
TOTAL CONTROL OVER THE PROCESS

07:06:10.711 --> 07:06:11.579
AND THE OUTCOME.

07:06:11.646 --> 07:06:12.446
THE TITLING COORDINATOR

07:06:12.513 --> 07:06:13.814
INVESTIGATOR WITH BOTH TRAIN

07:06:13.881 --> 07:06:15.683
LAWYERS THIS WAS NOT A FAIR

07:06:15.750 --> 07:06:17.585
UNBIASED PROCESS THIS WAS A

07:06:17.652 --> 07:06:18.953
MALICIOUS PROSECUTION.

07:06:19.020 --> 07:06:21.022
MY SON TOLD THE TRUTH HE BELIEVE

07:06:21.088 --> 07:06:23.124
THE PROCESS WOULD BE FAIR IN THE

07:06:23.190 --> 07:06:24.392
TRUTH WOULD EXONERATE HIM.

07:06:24.458 --> 07:06:26.093
BUT THE CLAIMED VICTIM WAS

07:06:26.160 --> 07:06:27.061
BELIEVED IN SPITE OF HER

07:06:27.128 --> 07:06:29.030
INCONSISTENCY CHANGES ANALYZE

07:06:29.096 --> 07:06:30.798
ALL WERE TRIBUTE TO TRAUMA AND

07:06:30.865 --> 07:06:32.233
MY SON'S INCONSISTENCIES

07:06:32.300 --> 07:06:34.335
MANUFACTURED BY THE INVESTIGATOR

07:06:34.402 --> 07:06:35.336
WERE USED AGAINST HIS

07:06:35.403 --> 07:06:36.003
CREDIBILITY.

07:06:36.070 --> 07:06:37.405
HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO QUESTION

07:06:37.471 --> 07:06:38.873
HER OR HER WITNESSES.

07:06:38.940 --> 07:06:40.141
MY SON WAS FOUND RESPONSIBLE

07:06:40.207 --> 07:06:43.110
WITHOUT ONE SHRED OF EVIDENCE HE

07:06:43.177 --> 07:06:44.946
WAS EXPELLED FOR LIFE DUE TO HIS

07:06:45.012 --> 07:06:46.147
ACCUSERS FINAL CLAIM.

07:06:46.213 --> 07:06:47.782
THIS IS WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE

07:06:47.848 --> 07:06:48.616
TRENCHES IN CALIFORNIA

07:06:48.683 --> 07:06:50.451
UNIVERSITIES INNOCENT STUDENTS

07:06:50.518 --> 07:06:52.153
ARE BEING EXPELLED.

07:06:52.219 --> 07:06:53.688
THE PROCESS IS CORRUPT.

07:06:53.754 --> 07:06:55.389
AND DEVASTATING TO FAMILIES I'M

07:06:55.456 --> 07:06:56.724
DISGUSTED AT THE BEHAVIOR THESE

07:06:56.791 --> 07:06:58.192
ADMINISTRATORS WITH A TOTAL

07:06:58.259 --> 07:07:00.628
DISREGARD FOR DUE PROCESS AND

07:07:00.695 --> 07:07:02.163
LACK OF INTEGRITY.

07:07:02.229 --> 07:07:03.664
SB FOUR NINETY THREE IN ITS

07:07:03.731 --> 07:07:05.766
CURRENT FORM IS RECKLESS AND

07:07:05.833 --> 07:07:07.001
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS

07:07:07.068 --> 07:07:09.036
MINORITY AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS

07:07:09.103 --> 07:07:10.871
MOST CANNOT MOUNT A LEGAL

07:07:10.938 --> 07:07:11.872
DEFENSE.

07:07:11.939 --> 07:07:13.007
POOR AND MINORITY STUDENTS ARE

07:07:13.074 --> 07:07:13.975
BEING RAILROADED AND WILL

07:07:14.041 --> 07:07:15.576

FOR THAT BUT AND GIVEN THE

07:07:33.461 --> 07:07:35.629
SENSITIVITY I THINK -- FOR THAT

07:07:35.696 --> 07:07:37.331
THIS BY LAW TO RESPECT THAT.

07:07:37.398 --> 07:07:38.899

07:08:02.356 --> 07:08:04.358
BILL FOR NINETY THREE BECAUSE IT

07:08:04.425 --> 07:08:07.028
DENIES EVERY CALIFORNIA CITIZEN

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- ONE

07:08:25.813 --> 07:08:27.481
THING ALL THE WITNESSES WHO

07:08:27.548 --> 07:08:29.216
TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT IN

07:08:29.283 --> 07:08:30.184
OPPOSITION.

07:08:30.251 --> 07:08:31.952
JUST LIKE TO GIVE THE AUTHOR THE

07:08:32.019 --> 07:08:34.922
OPPORTUNITY OR TO RESPOND TO THE

07:08:34.989 --> 07:08:36.757
CONCERNS OF DUE PROCESS

07:08:36.824 --> 07:08:38.626
PROTECTION THAT'S EXACTLY THE

07:08:38.692 --> 07:08:39.627
REASON FOR THE BILL.

07:08:39.693 --> 07:08:41.028
WE'RE WE'RE SETTING UP TO

07:08:41.095 --> 07:08:44.265
PROCESS YOU KNOW WHEN -- WHEN

07:08:44.331 --> 07:08:46.133
THIS ISSUE BECAME IS STARTED

07:08:46.200 --> 07:08:47.134
FINALLY?

07:08:47.201 --> 07:08:48.702
GETTING RECOGNIZE BECAUSE ALL

07:08:48.769 --> 07:08:49.870
THE STUDIES WERE SHOWING THE

07:08:49.937 --> 07:08:51.906
PREVALENCE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT ON

07:08:51.972 --> 07:08:53.074
CAMPUS.

07:08:53.140 --> 07:08:54.408
COLLEGES.

07:08:54.475 --> 07:08:56.210
RECOGNIZED THAT THEY REALLY

07:08:56.277 --> 07:08:57.745
NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT

07:08:57.812 --> 07:09:01.715
BUT MOST COLLEGES ARE NOT COURTS.

07:09:01.782 --> 07:09:03.884
AND SO THE VARIOUS KINDS OF

07:09:03.951 --> 07:09:06.353
SYSTEMS THAT THEY SET UP CLEARLY

07:09:06.420 --> 07:09:08.222
WERE NOT ADEQUATE WE'VE SEEN IT

07:09:08.289 --> 07:09:10.491
FROM BOTH SIDES IN THIS INSTANCE

07:09:10.558 --> 07:09:11.892
AND THAT IS WHY THIS BILL.

07:09:11.959 --> 07:09:13.561
EXISTS.

07:09:13.627 --> 07:09:17.098
SO WE HAVE TAKEN AMENDMENTS THAT

07:09:17.164 --> 07:09:19.400
CLARIFY WHEN A HIGHER EDUCATION

07:09:19.467 --> 07:09:21.035
INSTITUTION HAS A DUTY TO

07:09:21.102 --> 07:09:22.937
RESPOND TO INCIDENTS OF SEXUAL

07:09:23.003 --> 07:09:24.238
HARASSMENT.

07:09:24.305 --> 07:09:25.840
AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE TAKING

07:09:25.906 --> 07:09:28.209
POLICEOFF CAMPUS WE SPECIFY

07:09:28.275 --> 07:09:29.577
THAT THE CAMPUS GRIEVANCE

07:09:29.643 --> 07:09:31.145
PROCEDURE MUST SEPARATE THE

07:09:31.212 --> 07:09:33.080
INVESTIGATOR IN THE JUDICATA

07:09:33.147 --> 07:09:34.081
ROLES.

07:09:34.148 --> 07:09:35.349
THEY'RE DIFFERENT PEOPLE THEY'RE

07:09:35.416 --> 07:09:36.851
DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS AS THEY

07:09:36.917 --> 07:09:41.055
SHOULD BE -- IT WE SPECIFY.

07:09:41.122 --> 07:09:43.491
THAT WE WORK WITH WE ALSO THE

07:09:43.557 --> 07:09:45.893
BILL ALSO REQUIRES ALIVE.

07:09:45.960 --> 07:09:47.495
BUT IT COULD BE IN DIRECT CROSS

07:09:47.561 --> 07:09:48.996
EXAMINATION.

07:09:49.063 --> 07:09:52.066
BEFORE A NEUTRAL ADJUDICATOR.

07:09:52.133 --> 07:09:53.968
SO NOBODY HAS ANY SKIN IN THE

07:09:54.034 --> 07:09:55.569
GAME IF YOU WILL IT'S NOT AN

07:09:55.636 --> 07:09:57.304
INVESTIGATOR WHO'S.

07:09:57.371 --> 07:09:58.639
COME UP WITH ANY PERSONAL

07:09:58.706 --> 07:09:59.974
OPINIONS IT'S A NEUTRAL

07:10:00.040 --> 07:10:02.343
ADJUDICATOR WAS SPECIFIED

07:10:02.409 --> 07:10:03.677
SAFEGUARDS.

07:10:03.744 --> 07:10:05.045
AGAINST THE USE OF CROSS

07:10:05.112 --> 07:10:07.715
EXAMINATION FOR PURPOSES OF

07:10:07.781 --> 07:10:09.550
INTIMIDATION OR HARASSMENT.

07:10:09.617 --> 07:10:11.485
IN THAT OF COURSE THE JUDICATA --

07:10:11.552 --> 07:10:13.420
IS ABLE TO DO BECAUSE THERE ARE

07:10:13.487 --> 07:10:14.922
WE ARE EXPECTING THAT THEY ARE

07:10:14.989 --> 07:10:17.858
QUALIFIED THEY ARE TRAINED THIS

07:10:17.925 --> 07:10:19.994
IS INTERESTED TEACHER THAT THEY

07:10:20.060 --> 07:10:21.462
IF YOU KNOW WHO HAS SPARE TIME

07:10:21.529 --> 07:10:24.131
AFTER CLASS WE ARE REQUIRING

07:10:24.198 --> 07:10:26.333
THAT THIS BE A A PROCESS WORD.

07:10:26.400 --> 07:10:28.302
OF IT WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO

07:10:28.369 --> 07:10:29.870
UNDERSTAND THESE ISSUES THAT

07:10:29.937 --> 07:10:33.207
ALSO ARE A TRAINED ON TRAUMA --

07:10:33.274 --> 07:10:36.243
BUT ALSO THE INDEPENDENT NEUTRAL

07:10:36.310 --> 07:10:38.879
ADJUDICATOR -- IT GETS THE

07:10:38.946 --> 07:10:40.848
INFORMATION AND THE EVIDENCE IF

07:10:40.915 --> 07:10:43.317
YOU WILL THAT IS PRESENTED.

07:10:43.384 --> 07:10:46.086
THAT THERE IS THE ABILITY TO ASK

07:10:46.153 --> 07:10:47.488
QUESTIONS TO GO THROUGH THIS OUR

07:10:47.555 --> 07:10:50.858
CROSS EXAMINATION TYPE PROCESS

07:10:50.925 --> 07:10:51.892
THROUGH QUESTIONS.

07:10:51.959 --> 07:10:53.360
I THINK THE WITNESS TESTIFIED

07:10:53.427 --> 07:10:53.961
THAT THERE WERE SO MANY

07:10:54.028 --> 07:10:55.429
QUESTIONS AND MANY OF THEM

07:10:55.496 --> 07:10:57.231
TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE THAT WERE

07:10:57.298 --> 07:10:58.499
ASKED OF HER.

07:10:58.566 --> 07:11:01.535
AN ARBITRATOR CAN SAY WAIT A

07:11:01.602 --> 07:11:02.036
MINUTE.

07:11:02.102 --> 07:11:02.970
YOU KNOW.

07:11:03.037 --> 07:11:04.405
IN A LIKE A LIKE A JUDGE WOULD

07:11:04.471 --> 07:11:05.206
DO IF THIS WERE ACTUALLY IN A

07:11:05.272 --> 07:11:06.640
CRIMINAL CASE WHICH BY THE WAY

07:11:06.707 --> 07:11:08.008
IT IS NOT.

07:11:08.075 --> 07:11:10.544
BUT WE ARE REQUIRING THE ABILITY

07:11:10.611 --> 07:11:11.912
TO HAVE A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL

07:11:11.979 --> 07:11:13.113
HEARING BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT

07:11:13.180 --> 07:11:14.915
TITLE NINE CALLS.

07:11:14.982 --> 07:11:18.452
FOR SO -- IT WE ALSO MODIFY IT

07:11:18.519 --> 07:11:20.321
IN THESE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THE

07:11:20.387 --> 07:11:22.089
REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO THE TO

07:11:22.156 --> 07:11:23.390
THE PROVISION OF A LIST OF

07:11:23.457 --> 07:11:25.326
ATTORNEYS AND OTHER RESOURCES

07:11:25.392 --> 07:11:27.027
THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO BOTH

07:11:27.094 --> 07:11:31.932
SIDES -- AND AGAIN.

07:11:31.999 --> 07:11:35.402
RECOGNIZING THE NEED TO A NUMBER.

07:11:35.469 --> 07:11:39.273
ONE ADDRESS THIS THIS SCOURGE ON

07:11:39.340 --> 07:11:42.443
OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES -- HAVING A

07:11:42.509 --> 07:11:45.479
PROCESS BY WHICH ALLEGATIONS CAN

07:11:45.546 --> 07:11:46.480
BE BROUGHT FORWARD THAT THEY CAN

07:11:46.547 --> 07:11:49.450
BE -- IDENTIFIED AND HEARD IN AN

07:11:49.516 --> 07:11:50.651
IMPARTIAL.

07:11:50.718 --> 07:11:54.121
ADJUDICATORY FASHION THAT THE

07:11:54.188 --> 07:11:55.923
RESOLUTION TAKES INTO ACCOUNT

07:11:55.990 --> 07:11:57.424
THE NEEDS.

07:11:57.491 --> 07:11:59.893
OF THE VICTIM IF IT DETERMINES

07:11:59.960 --> 07:12:00.694
THAT THE RATE THAT THAT THE

07:12:00.761 --> 07:12:02.663
FACTS ARE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT

07:12:02.730 --> 07:12:03.831
TO HAVE OCCURRED.

07:12:03.897 --> 07:12:05.566
MANY OF THEM SIMPLE THINGS LIKE

07:12:05.633 --> 07:12:09.870
MAKING SURE THAT STUDENTS DON'T

07:12:09.937 --> 07:12:10.537
HAVE.

07:12:10.604 --> 07:12:11.272
TO CEDAR THEIR PERPETRATOR ON

07:12:11.338 --> 07:12:12.773
CAMPUS MOVING THEM FROM ONE DORM

07:12:12.840 --> 07:12:14.975
TO ANOTHER THESE ARE THE KINDS

07:12:15.042 --> 07:12:16.543
OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACT.

07:12:16.610 --> 07:12:18.812
UNLESS THEY ARE DETERMINED TO

07:12:18.879 --> 07:12:21.148
HAVE REACHED A LEVEL WHERE SOME

07:12:21.215 --> 07:12:22.716
OTHER KIND OF ACTION IS

07:12:22.783 --> 07:12:24.985
APPROPRIATE BUT TO BE DONE IN AN

07:12:25.052 --> 07:12:26.487
IMPARTIAL MANNER.

07:12:26.553 --> 07:12:28.122
I THINK THAT IS THE CONCERN THAT

07:12:28.188 --> 07:12:29.256
WE HAVE.

07:12:29.323 --> 07:12:30.424
ALL HAD.

07:12:30.491 --> 07:12:32.192
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS

07:12:32.259 --> 07:12:33.494
DESIGNED TO DO BETTER MONNING DO

07:12:33.560 --> 07:12:36.130
YOU HAVE -- ANY MORE SPECIFIC

07:12:36.196 --> 07:12:38.032
QUESTIONS.

07:12:38.098 --> 07:12:40.868
A MOVIE ON TO A CENTER JONES.

07:12:40.934 --> 07:12:42.569
AS A DENSER COVER EURO VERY MUCH

07:12:42.636 --> 07:12:43.904
FOR THE EXPLANATION THOSE

07:12:43.971 --> 07:12:46.273
AMENDMENTS -- ARE THOSE THE

07:12:46.340 --> 07:12:47.841
MEMBERS THAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED

GRADUATE STUDENT UNIONS SO I AT

07:16:18.018 --> 07:16:18.685
THIS POINT THE BILL DOESN'T

CONTEMPLATE.

07:16:19.553 --> 07:16:20.921
WHEN THERE'S JUST BROKE GRADUATE

THREE WOULD SUPERSEDE YOU THINK --

07:16:28.428 --> 07:16:29.263
BUT WE HAVE TO RESEARCH THAT

07:16:29.329 --> 07:16:30.264
ISSUE WITH REGARD TO THE

07:16:30.330 --> 07:16:31.598
GRADUATE STUDENTS AT UNDERGRAD I

07:16:31.665 --> 07:16:32.733

LEGISLATION RIDLEY CERTAINLY

07:16:45.779 --> 07:16:46.947
THERE SHOULD BE.

07:16:47.014 --> 07:16:48.749
A MINUTE MY OPINION WOULD BE

07:16:48.815 --> 07:16:51.485
THAT THE THIS IS A DUE PROCESS

07:16:51.552 --> 07:16:52.753

THAT'S NOT THE NATE THAT THAT'S

07:16:57.591 --> 07:17:02.596
OUTSIDE THE FOUR CORNERS OF THIS

07:17:02.663 --> 07:17:03.997

07:19:18.632 --> 07:19:20.200
DESCRIBE THE PREPONDERANCE OF

07:19:20.267 --> 07:19:20.767
THE EVIDENCE STANDARD IN A

07:19:20.834 --> 07:19:22.736
SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT WAY THAN IT'S

07:19:22.803 --> 07:19:24.705
MORE COMMONLY USED -- BUT THEY

07:19:24.771 --> 07:19:26.907
THEY AGREE IN THE REPORT THAT

07:19:26.973 --> 07:19:27.708
THAT IS THE STANDARD THAT SHOULD

07:19:27.774 --> 07:19:29.676
BE APPLIED -- HAVE THE RIGHT TO

07:19:29.743 --> 07:19:30.844

07:19:30.911 --> 07:19:32.079
THIS BILL AS WELL AND THEN

07:19:32.145 --> 07:19:33.413
FINALLY ENSURING THAT CROSS

07:19:33.480 --> 07:19:35.482
EXAMINATION IS ALLOWED -- BUT

07:19:35.549 --> 07:19:37.718
BUT IF IN DIRECT IS OKAY AND

07:19:37.784 --> 07:19:38.552
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL

07:19:38.618 --> 07:19:40.287
DOES IT SAYS THAT WITH WITH THE

07:19:40.353 --> 07:19:41.421
NEW AMENDMENTS THAT CROSS

07:19:41.488 --> 07:19:42.522
EXAMINATION LIVE CROSS

07:19:42.589 --> 07:19:45.092
EXAMINATION IS -- REQUIRED BUT

07:19:45.158 --> 07:19:46.393
IT CAN BE IN DIRECT AND THAT'S

07:19:46.460 --> 07:19:47.728
REALLY TO PREVENT THE KIND OF

07:19:47.794 --> 07:19:49.196
HARASSING BEHAVIOR THAT WE'VE

07:19:49.262 --> 07:19:51.398
SEEN ADVOCATES REPRESENT US

07:19:51.465 --> 07:19:52.933

TACTICS IN THIS CROSS

07:20:00.974 --> 07:20:02.209
EXAMINATION PROCESS SO THIS

07:20:02.275 --> 07:20:03.410
WOULD ALLOW THESE PROTECTIONS

07:20:03.477 --> 07:20:04.811
FOR THE NEUTRAL JUDICATA -- TO

07:20:04.878 --> 07:20:06.179

EITHER PARTY HAS RESPOND IN LIVE

07:20:09.683 --> 07:20:11.384
TIME REAL TIME -- BUT IT DOES

07:20:11.451 --> 07:20:16.590
NOT HAVE TO BE DIRECT WHICH IS

07:20:16.656 --> 07:20:17.190
CONSISTENT WITH THE WORK TASK

07:20:17.257 --> 07:20:18.258
FORCE REPORT.

07:20:18.325 --> 07:20:19.760
OKAY AND I I SAYS WELL AS COURT

07:20:19.826 --> 07:20:20.861
RECENT COURT DECISIONS THIS

ACCORD WITH YOUR ANSWERING YES

07:20:21.528 --> 07:20:22.395
ACTUALLY IT'S INTERESTING

07:20:22.462 --> 07:20:24.598
BECAUSE THE THE WORKING GROUP

07:20:24.664 --> 07:20:27.601
RELIED HEAVILY ON THE A BA TASK

07:20:27.667 --> 07:20:29.202
FORCE ON WHICH I SAT.

07:20:29.269 --> 07:20:30.737
OKAY IF YOU'LL SEE THROUGHOUT

07:20:30.804 --> 07:20:32.639
THE FOOTNOTES ARE ALL QUOTED

07:20:32.706 --> 07:20:34.374
QUOTED RAIL ABA AND WE WORKED

07:20:34.441 --> 07:20:35.842
VERY HARD WE HAD VICTIMS

07:20:35.909 --> 07:20:37.978
ADVOCATES WE HAD CAMPUS

07:20:38.044 --> 07:20:39.246
ADMINISTRATORS AND WE HAD

07:20:39.312 --> 07:20:41.348
DEFENSE PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF.

07:20:41.414 --> 07:20:43.717
AND WE HAMMERED IT OUT WE WERE

07:20:43.784 --> 07:20:46.486
ABLE TO COME TO CONSENSUS SO I

07:20:46.553 --> 07:20:48.054
THINK THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD.

07:20:48.121 --> 07:20:51.258
REPORT AND I I DO THINK THAT.

07:20:51.324 --> 07:20:53.927
US SENATOR JACKSON AND I FORGOT

RESOLUTION IT'S JUST A REPORT OF

07:21:09.676 --> 07:21:10.243
ONE SECTION OF THE AB EIGHT JUST

07:21:10.310 --> 07:21:11.011
TO BE CLEAR.

07:21:11.077 --> 07:21:12.479
WHAT DOES REFLECT THE POLICY OF

07:21:12.546 --> 07:21:13.680
THE ABA?

07:21:13.747 --> 07:21:14.915
THE SECTION BECAUSE THERE WERE

07:21:14.981 --> 07:21:16.149
IS THAT.

07:21:16.216 --> 07:21:17.918
WOULD YOU CALL IT SOCIAL JUSTICE

VIEW THAT DIDN'T AGREE WITH US --

07:21:33.200 --> 07:21:35.802
SURROUNDED ANYMORE MORE

07:21:35.869 --> 07:21:39.506
QUESTIONS -- I THINK -- SORT OF

07:21:39.573 --> 07:21:41.174
LIKE CENTER ALLEN -- YOU KNOW

07:21:41.241 --> 07:21:42.976

THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO THROUGH --

07:21:46.813 --> 07:21:48.215
THE AMENDMENTS MY INITIAL

07:21:48.281 --> 07:21:50.717
CONCERN -- IS MAKING SURE THAT

07:21:50.784 --> 07:21:52.485
THAT BALANCE WAS STRUCK IS THAT

07:21:52.552 --> 07:21:53.687
WE HEARD.

07:21:53.753 --> 07:21:58.225
TESTIMONY -- FROM -- A VICTIM I

07:21:58.291 --> 07:22:00.560

07:22:00.627 --> 07:22:02.295
ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE WHERE.

07:22:02.362 --> 07:22:04.464
THE ALLEGED PERPETRATOR WAS OF A

07:22:04.531 --> 07:22:06.499
VICTIM [inaudible]

07:22:06.566 --> 07:22:09.536
ODD OR THAT'S THE WAY -- THAT

07:22:09.603 --> 07:22:11.638

07:22:11.705 --> 07:22:13.406
PLAYED OUT.

07:22:13.473 --> 07:22:15.575
MAKING CERTAIN THAT INDIVIDUAL

07:22:15.642 --> 07:22:16.977
WHO HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF

07:22:17.043 --> 07:22:19.312

07:22:23.383 --> 07:22:25.018
I THINK IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF

07:22:25.085 --> 07:22:28.221
OUR TO PROCESS -- BUT I RARELY

07:22:28.288 --> 07:22:30.824

AS FAR AS GIVING THE PROTECTIONS

07:23:31.451 --> 07:23:33.987
THAT ARE NECESSARY -- TO BOTH

07:23:34.054 --> 07:23:36.156
THE PARTIES IN THESE MATTERS I

07:23:36.222 --> 07:23:38.191
PERSONALLY HOPE THAT WE WILL

07:23:45.699 --> 07:23:48.501
HAVE GOT TO GET A HANDLE ON IT

07:23:48.568 --> 07:23:50.570
