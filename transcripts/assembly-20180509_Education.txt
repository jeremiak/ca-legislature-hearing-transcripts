I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT. UNDER CURRENT LAW EDUCATION CODE FORTY EIGHT NINE HUNDRED PROVIDES THAT SEXUAL CYBERBULLYING CAN BE AN OFFENSE WORTHY OF SCHOOL SUSPENSION OR OTHER PUNISHMENT. HOWEVER THERE'S NO PROVISION CURRENT LAW. THAT ALLOWS EDUCATION TO REACH STUDENTS BEFORE THINGS GET TO THAT STAGE. THIS BILL WOULD GIVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THE OPTION NOT A MANDATE BUT AN OPTION. CORPORATION AND. EDUCATION INTO THE SEX ED CURRICULUM THAT TEACHES KIDS ABOUT THE LEGAL PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL DANGERS OF SENDING SEXUALLY EXPLICIT MESSAGES USING THEIR PHONES. OR OR ONLINE RESOURCES. IT HAS A BROAD COALITION OF SUPPORT. FROM THE CALIFORNIA PTA THE NATIONAL RURAL EDUCATORS ASSOCIATION LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUPS AND VICTIMS RIGHTS GROUPS. AND. WITH ME TODAY'S DJ PITTENGER FROM THE SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. AND LASTLY I'D JUST SAY I WERE SEEING A. NATIONAL MOVEMENT OF SORTS WHICH IS FUELING A CULTURE CHANGE ACROSS SOCIETY. OF THAT IS MUCH NEEDED WITH RESPECT TO APPROPRIATE CONDUCT. THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO GIVE DISTRICTS THE OPTION OF EDUCATING KIDS AT EARLY STAGE IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT. ABOUT OF APPROPRIATE. USES OF THEIR PHONES AND OTHER MATERIALS. AND I THINK IT'S A VALUABLE MEASURE TO CONSIDER. THANK THANK YOU. JR ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT SALAS OBISPO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. I URGE YOU TO LOOK CLOSELY AT THIS INFORMATION. I WAS INTRODUCED TO. ASSEMBLYMAN CUNNINGHAM REGARDING THIS TOPIC. DUE TO A REAL CASE THAT WAS OCCURRING IN ONE OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITHIN OUR COUNTY. WE HAD YOUNG PEOPLE WHO. OUT THE REQUEST OF ADULTS. WORD TAKING PICTURES OF EACH OTHER. POSSESSED DOT. IMAGE. AND. WERE NOT AWARE. OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF THEM. HAVING ACCESS AND OBTAINING NOT A CHILD* OR. WHAT IT MIGHT LEAD TO? IN REGARDS TO THE THE VICTIM THAT I THE IMAGE WAS TAKEN CARE OF. I'M IN MY YEARS OF EDUCATION I HAVE COME ACROSS THIS SITUATION. ON MANY OCCASIONS AND I THINK THAT WE. NEED TO PROVIDE OUR CHILDREN WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE EDUCATED REGARDING THEIR RISKS REGARDING TECHNOLOGY USE IN THIS AREA. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I SEE NO OTHER WITNESSES ANY OPPOSITION. I WAS WAITING FOR THE GENTLEMAN THE TABLE SPEAK GRANT MARTIN ON BEHALF OF THE AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION ONE OF THE LARGEST PROVIDERS OF STD PREVENTION AND. AND TREATMENT SERVICES IN THE STATE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL. HE ANY ANY OPPOSITION. AREA. MY ANGER ON A SALE YOU OF CALIFORNIA AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THAT BELL. MAY BELIEVE IT INJECTS UNNECESSARY CONFUSION AND TO THE INSTRUCTION ON THIS MATERIALS AND ADDS A. OPTIONAL SECTION INTO A PROGRAM THAT OTHERWISE HAS MANDATED TOPICS OF INSTRUCTIONS. WE THINK THE TERM SEXUALLY SUGGESTIVE AND SEXUALLY EXPLICIT ARE VAGUE AND OPEN TO INTERPRETATION WAYS THAT DOESN'T REFLECT THE HEALTH THE COULD BE. IN WAYS THAT DOESN'T REFLECT THE HEALTH POSITIVE FRAMEWORK OF OUR CURRENT COMPREHENSIVE SEXUAL HEALTH EDUCATION LAWS. I ALSO THINK IT IS SUPERFLUOUS IN THE CURRENT CONTEXT THE ANALYSIS. LAYS OUT IN GREAT DETAIL HOW THIS INFORMATION HAS BEEN PUT INTO THE FRAMEWORK AT AGE APPROPRIATE LEVELS. ALL THE WAY FROM ELEMENTARY TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS AND. EXERCISES ON THESE ISSUES AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU KNOW VOTE. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER OPPOSITION. SEEN KNOW OPPOSITION ANY COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SAYING NINE. WE WILL WAIT. INTO WE HAVE A QUORUM TO. IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION LET ME KNOW. I GO YES WELL QUICK QUESTION. BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT THEY PRESENTED DO YOU HAVE A REAL. RESPONSE OF THAT IN TERMS OF WHETHER NOT THIS BILL IS LOOKING AT ALL THE ELEMENTS THAT GO INTO THIS. HEALTHY KIDS ACT. IN TERMS OF THE LEVELS OF ENGAGEMENT AND SO FORTH AND SO ON AND WHETHER NOT THIS FITS IN IN SOME WAY. YEAH I THINK THERE'S A CONSERVATIVE DATA THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT SOME OF IT THAT THIS IS BECOMING A GROWING PROBLEM AND THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT. THAT CELL PHONES ARE BEING USED USUALLY CELLPHONES BUT YOU'RE ALSO ALSO COMPUTERS. ARE BEING USED TO SHARE SESSION SEXUALLY EXPLICIT PICTURES OF THE KIDS SOMETIMES ADULTS ARE SOLICITING KIDS FOR THAT SORT OF THING. YEAH IT'S A GROWING TREND THERE'S ONE PARTICULAR SURVEY THAT. SUGGESTED THAT FIFTEEN UP TO FIFTEEN PERCENT OF KIDS HAVE. AND GAUGE IN THIS KIND OF CONDUCT TO THE EXTENT THAT'S BEING ADDRESSED RIGHT NOW THROUGH EXISTING. CURRICULA I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S AFFECTED THAN THEIR SOME DISTRICTS THAT ARE TAKING THE POSITION AND LOOKING AT WHAT. CAN BE IN A COMPREHENSIVE SEX ED PROGRAM IN AS IT'S OUTLINED IN THE AT CO RIGHT NOW. THAT THAT IN LEICESTER SOMETHING THAT ALLOWS THEM TO. INCORPORATE THIS IN THE CURRICULUM. THEY ARE FEELING LIKE THEY CAN'T DO IT. AND WE SIMPLY MADE OPTIONAL BECAUSE IF THIS IS A PROBLEM IN A PARTICULAR SCHOOL DISTRICT. THEY DO THIS BILL WOULD GIVE THEM THE OPTION TO INCORPORATE THAT PARK. YES DO SOME PREVENTION KIND OF TRAINING AND THAT SORT OF THING. WHERE THEY DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE THE OPTION AT LEAST A LOT OF THEM DON'T BELIEVE THEY DO IF THEY'RE NOT HAVING A PROBLEM THE DISTRICT THEN? WE CAN. PROCEED WITH WHAT'S IN THEIR EXISTING. SEX ED CLASSES WOULD THERE. CURRICULUM PERSONS WHO DESIGNED THE CURRICULUM BASICALLY BEING ASKED TO DO THIS OR IS THIS JUST SOMETHING WE SAYING YOU CAN DO IT IF YOU FEEL LIKE DOING IT BUT. IS IT BEING TAILORED SO THAT THEY KNOW THAT IT SHOULD FIT INTO THE REGULAR CURRICULUM. JERRY MATCH I'M INTO THE CURRENT CURRICULUM AS DESIGNED. YOU I'M AUTHOR OF THE HEALTHY KIDS AG BILL SO I AND I KNOW I DIDN'T WRITE THE CREEK IN BUT I KNOW HOW COMPLICATED AN INTRICATE IT IS SO. YOU WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER ADDITIONAL THINGS COMING AND COMING AND IN A CERTAIN WAY SO THAT'S WHY I WAS WONDERING WHETHER NOT. THAT'S PART OF THIS MY MY INTENT IS TO AUGMENT WHAT'S EXISTING NOT. SUPPLEMENT OR RIGHT SUPPLANT ANY OF IT BUT IF I. IF I CAN IF I CAN ASK MY WITNESSES RESPOND. THAT'S EXACTLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I LIKED ABOUT THIS WHEN I READ IT. AS WE KNOW EDUCATION IS COMPLICATED WE KEEP CRAMMING MORE AND MORE AND MORE INTO OUR DAY. I SEE THIS FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THAT DISTRICT FOLKS WHO ARE. LOOKING AT THE CURRICULUM DESIGNING THE COURSEWORK. THE SCHOOL BOARDS IT JUST CALLS THE ATTENTION TO OH YES THIS IS A PLACE WHERE WE MIGHT WANT TO MENTION THIS. WITHIN WHAT WE ALREADY DO I DON'T SEE THAT IT CHANGES ANYTHING THAT WERE DOING. ITS NOT GOING OUTSIDE OF ANY GUIDELINES OF CURRICULUM OR WHAT THIS LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED. IT JUST BECAUSE THE ATTENTION TO THE FOLKS THAT. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND WE MIGHT WANT TO BRING THIS UP. BRINGING THE TECHNOLOGY PIECE INTO IT. SO ARE WE ASKING FOR THE PERSONS WHO ARE WE ASKING FOR A SPECIFIC A CURRICULUM TO BE DEVELOPED. THAT WOULD THEN BE GIVEN TO SCHOOLS WHO MAY WANT TO IMPLEMENT IT COULD CAN I CAN I INTERJECT CHAIRMAN I MAY HAVE SOME INFORMATION JUST UP TO HELP YOU MAKE IT TO YOUR RIGHT. YOU DID AUTHOR BILL AND THAT FRAMEWORK THE DRAFT IS OUT. OKAY SO THIS BILL ACTUALLY DOESN'T TOUCH THAT FRAME OF THIS BILL MERELY AUTHORIZES DISTRICTS. TO. TO TO. I'M TO WRITE INSTRUCTIONS ON THIS AND MAYBE THAT IS THIS BILL MAKES IT WOULD THROUGH THE PROCESS. AND THAT FREE MARKETS PROVED STILL WON'T BE NECESSARY. QUITE FRANKLY SO. BUT WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS AN ISSUE DOESN'T HAVE A MIDDLE SCHOOLER ON HERE AND STUFF. RIGHT SO. AND HIGH SCHOOLERS OUTSIDE THE I KNOW THIS IS AN ISSUE I THINK WHERE WE'RE GONNA END UP POTENTIALLY IS. THE FRAMEWORK. WHAT LAST BEFORE THIS BILL GETS TO THE PROCESS AND THAT WOULD? WELL THAT'S WHAT I TRIED THAT YET BUT I HOPE WOULD HAPPEN I MEAN I'M NOT OPPOSED TO THE BILL I THINK IT IS INFORMATION THAT'S IMPORTANT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW THAT WEEK WITH THAT WE GIVE OUR SCHOOLS AND AND LEADERSHIP THOUGH THOUGH THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED TO ACTUALLY MAKE IT FIT WITHIN IT AND TO COMPLEMENT WHAT'S GOING ON RATHER THAN JUST. YOU KNOW THAT'S WHY I WAS ASKING IS THIS CALLING FOR THEM TO DO THAT TO DO THAT. THE WORK OF. YOU KNOW MAKING SURE OR EITHER CALLING FOR THE STATE. OF SUPERINTENDED THE CRITICAL COMMITTEE TO TO TO HAND OUT SOMETHING THAT TO GIVE SOMETHING TO THEM. IT CURRENTLY. HAS NO MANDATE ASPECT AND WE LOOKED AROUND FOR SOMETHING WELL MAYBE THERE'S A WAY THIS IS BEING DONE ALREADY THAT WE CAN. PUT INTO STATUTE AND. QUITE FRANKLY I DIDN'T I DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING THAT AYE. AYE THOUGHTS OF LEASE IT RATHER OPEN BUT I MEAN YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT TO MAKING SURE THIS IS.

BECAUSE WE ARE RUNNING SHORT OF BILLS HERE PRETTY SOON. SO. THEY WERE NOT WAITING. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO START OFF BY BEGINNING AT S. BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. WE KNOW THAT CHILDREN LEARN BEST WHEN THEY HAVE A STABLE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS THE GOAL OF AB THIRTY ONE FORTY NINE IS TO PROVIDE CONTENT CONTINUITY OF INSTRUCTION TO CHILDREN. WHOSE TEACHERS ARE OUT ON LONG TERM LEAVES FROM TALKING TO SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS IF FROM THE DISTRICT. AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE IT'S CLEAR THE AVAILABLE PERMITS THROUGH THE COMMISSION ON TEACHING CREDENTIALING DO NOT ADDRESS ALL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LEAD TO LONG TERM LEAVES. FOR INSTANCE WHEN TEACHERS OF RECORD DO NOT PLAN TO BE OUT OF THE CLASSROOM FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN FOR WHATEVER REASON HAVE TO PRO LONG THEIR LEAVE. SCHOOL EMPLOYERS ARE OFTEN LEFT WITH NO CHOICE BUT TO BRING IN ANOTHER SUBSTITUTE TEACHER AFTER THE TWENTY OR THIRTY DAY STATUTORY LIMITS. THIS DISRUPTS THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT AND IS NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF STUDENTS. I HOPE THAT THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING CONVENES AND MEANINGFUL STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS AND MAKES THE NECESSARY CHANGES TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE I DESCRIBED AND ANY OTHERS THAT COME ABOUT. THROUGH THE PROCESS CURRENTLY ESTABLISH. WITH ME TODAY IS EVEN CARILLO WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS AND GOT LOST MUCH HUDDLE WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARD ASSOCIATION TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. THANK YOU. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. CARE MEMBERS PEOPLE. THANK YOU SAKE MY COUNTRY WITH ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS WE ARE CO SPONSOR OF AB THIRTY ONE FORTY NINE. NOW WE ALL SHARE THE SAME DESIRE FOR OUR FOR OUR CHILDREN AND THAT'S TO MAINTAIN CONTINUITY OF INSTRUCTION. FOR PUTTING THE MOST HIGHLY TRAINED TEACHER IN EVERY CLASSROOM. OUR GOAL WITH BABY THIRTY ONE FORTY NINE WAS THE GIVE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS THE ABILITY TO PREVENT DATA DAY SUBSTITUTES FROM CYCLING IN AND OUT OF CLASSROOMS. AND INSTEAD KEEP IN FRONT OF STUDENTS SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS. WHO HAVE PROVEN TRACK RECORDS? ADDITIONALLY THE EXPECTATION WAS THAT OUR MEMBERS WOULD PROVIDE THESE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE SUBSTITUTES WITH ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND SUPPORTS. TO FURTHER THEIR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND PUT THEM ON THE PATH TO BECOMING EITHER TIPS ALL HOLDERS OR FULLY CREDENTIALED TEACHERS. WE WILL NOW FOCUS OUR ATTENTION ON THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. PUBLIC ADVOCATES AND ALL OTHER. STAKEHOLDERS TO BRING ABOUT MEANINGFUL CHANGE THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. CALLS WHICH OTHER CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION I ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE. AND WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER EFFORTS TO. ADDRESS THIS ISSUE CSP WILL. BE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS AT THE ET SEEMED. WE'VE OUR OUR WORK TOWARDS. POSSIBLY GETTING SOLUTION THAT THAT CARD MEMBERS COULD USE A TO ADDRESS THIS THIS ISSUE THANK YOU I DIDN'T SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS ERIC LAX ON BEHALF OF THE SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS THE SCHOOL EMPLOYERS ASSOCIATION. SUPPORT. MEMBERS MICHAEL HOLE SIZE THERE ON BEHALF THE KERN COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS OFFICE WE JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER LAMONT FOR. BEING AN ADVOCATE ON THIS ISSUE WE VERY MUCH SUPPORT HER EFFORTS I CAN ALSO THINK THE SAME ON HERS. THANK YOU ANDREA BALLING TO HAVE FOR THE SAN JOSE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. JEFF BARKER RIVERSIDE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT SCHOOLS AND SUPPORT. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS S. BELGER SEE WITH CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. HONOR WITH THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT WE WILL RECOMMEND REMOVING OUR OPPOSITION. ON FIRE AND WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S BILL ANALYSIS AND WE APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSORS. OUR PRIMARY CONCERN AGAIN IS THAT ON SUBSTITUTE SHORT TERM SUBSTITUTES ARE UNDER QUALIFIED IN THERE OKAY FOR SHORT TERM. DE COVERAGE BUT WHEN YOU'RE HAVE A LONGER TERM ABSENCE FOR. A TEACHER. THAT INTRUDE TEACHER OF RECORD HAS TO HAVE TRAINING IN SUPPORT AND MENTORS AND WE WERE REALLY CONCERNED WITH THE BILL AS AMENDED MAY FIRST SAID IT WAIT. ON JEOPARDIZE THE QUALITY OF STUDENTS DIRECTION AND ALSO WEEKEND THE SAFEGUARDS AT THE COMMISSION HAS PUT IN FOR CERTAIN OUT PERMITS PUT PRIMARILY THE TEMPORARY PERMIT FOR STATUTORY LEAVE SO THAT. SO WE FEEL THAT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT WELL ADDRESS ARE CONCERNED WE WILL ON RECOMMEND REMOVING OUR OPPOSITION AND WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH EVERYBODY THE LEGISLATURE THE COMMISSION AND STAKEHOLDERS. TO TOWARDS THAT END THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION RATTLE MASSARO WITH PUBLIC ADVOCATES AGAIN APPRECIATE AND THE OPENNESS OF THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS I'M ON THIS ISSUE WITH COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WE REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION. WE WERE VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT ANY ATTEMPTS TO. EVEN IF WE UNDERSTAND THE TEACHER SHORTAGE AND THAT THE FOLKS FEEL PRETTY STRAPPED TO TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS AN ADULT IN FRONT OF STUDENTS AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT LOWERING OUR STANDARDS. AND WE BELIEVE THE PROPER PLACE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION IS OF THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING AN AGENCY VERY WELL EQUIPPED TOGETHER STAKEHOLDERS AND REALLY COME TO THE BEST CONSENSUS FOR HOW TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE WITH THE MINIMAL IMPACT. ON THE THE QUALIFIED EDUCATORS IN FRONT OF OUR HIGHEST EIGHT STUDENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I ANY OTHER OPPOSITION SEEN OPPOSITION WILL BRING IT BACK. ON THANK YOU MUSLIM OWNED. I UNDERSTAND THIS IS AN ISSUE WE JUST GOT TO BE CAREFUL HOW WE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE I APPRECIATE THAT WOULD TURN OVER TO THE COMMISSION. AND I AM CONFIDENT THEY WILL BE EXPEDITIOUS IN OUR ESOS ADDRESS HOUSING A BILL BE EXPEDITIOUS PUT. THE TOSS REMEMBER THAT AND I'M. IN UNPREPARED AND UNDERPREPARED TEACHER LEADS TO AN UNHEARD STOOD. SO WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT PUTTING UNTRAINED. UNDER HER TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOM FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME THAT'S MY CONCERN LISTEN I I SUB OVER THE PHONE AND I HAVE ONE IN THE STATE TAUGHT SEVENTH GRADE ALGEBRA. AND ONE DAY. WHEN I WAS A CHALLENGE FOR ME I CAN'T IMAGINE BEING ASSIGNED TO THAT FOR SIXTY DAYS IN THE I WOULD WANT US I WOULD WANT SOMEONE WHO'S WHO'S TRAINED. WHO HAS SOME CONTENT KNOWLEDGE FOR SURE BUT ALSO JUST AS IMPORTANT QUITE FRANK ESPECIALLY MIDDLE MIDDLE SCHOOL CLASSROOM? IS CLUSTER MANAGEMENT SKILLS YOU'VE GOTTA UNDERSTAND THAT SUBSTITUTES COMING THERE WITH VIRTUALLY NO TRAINING. NO TRAINING AND PUT THEM IN A CLASS OF FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. CAN HAVE VERY NEGATIVE THE RESULTS CAN CAN VERY MUCH NEGATIVELY IMPACTS TO PERFORMANCE THAT'S A CONVENE THAT A VERY VALID CONCERN. I THINK WE'VE HERE HEARD SOME PRESENT TODAY JUST BECAUSE IT'S. INCONVENIENT DOESN'T MEAN YOU DON'T NEED TO TRAIN YOUR SUBSTITUTES. FACT I WOULD RECOMMEND IT SOME THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE A POOL AMONG SUPPORT SUBSTITUTES OF TRAIN SETS TO SCAN THAT CAN PERFORM THOSE MORE LONG TERM. SUBSTITUTE POSITIONS I THINK THAT WOULD BE KIND OF WISE POLICY FOR SOME SOME DISTRICTS TO ADOPT. AND ALSO THAT AS THE AS THE CDC WHOEVER LOOKS AT THIS. THE STAKEHOLDERS ISSUE TO DISCUSS A SUNSET DATE BECAUSE HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET TO HONOR WE DON'T HAVE THAT TEACHER SHORT AGREE RIGHT. SO I'M WITH THAT. THANK YOU.

I THINK OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT A B. THIRTY EIGHTY SIX. NOW THIS IS SIMILAR IN CONCEPT TO A BILL I PRESENT LAST YEAR IN THAT IT GIVES SPECIFIED STUDENTS A RIGHT TO A TRANSFER TO A SCHOOL DISTRICT IS WILLING. AYE TO ACCEPT THEM. AT LAST YEAR'S HEARING AS SOME MAY REMEMBER I MEMBERS THIS COMMITTEE EXPRESSED CONCERN AND THAT MY BILL MIGHT BE DISRUPTIVE FOR DISTRICTS AS IN THEORY IT COULD HAVE EXTENDED A RIGHT TO TRANSFER TO AROUND. AYE SIXTY PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS SO IN RESPONSE TO THOSE CONCERNS AYE THIS BILL COVERS A SUBSTANTIALLY NARROWER POPULATION OF STUDENTS A VERY SMALL FRACTION OF THAT. AND IT'S SPECIFICALLY AIMED AT OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS. HOMELESS MIGRANTS FOSTER AND BELIEVE YOU. I AS A RESULT OF THE GROUPS WHO OPPOSE LAST YEAR'S BILL ARE NOT IN OPPOSITION HOWARD NOT FILED ANY OPPOSITION TO THAT. QUITE SIMPLY I AB THIRTY SIX WOULD ALLOW HOMELESS MIGRANT FOSTER AND BULLIED USED TO TRANSFER TO A DIFFERENT SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE ONE THAT THEY BE ASSIGNED TO BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY LIVE. NOW Y. THESE PARTICULAR STUDENTS WHY HOMELESS MIGRANT FOSTER AND BULLIED YOUTH. BECAUSE THESE ARE THE MOST TRANSIENT THE STUDENTS MOST DEPRIVED OF THE STABILITY THAT IS SO IMPORTANT TO ACADEMIC SUCCESS. THIS LACK OF EDUCATIONAL STABILITY COMPOUNDS THE BURDENS TRAUMAS AND CHALLENGES THAT HOMELESS MIGRANT FOSTER AND BELIEVE YOUTH OFTEN FACE. AB THIRTY EIGHTY SIX WILL PROVIDE A MUCH NEEDED A MEASURE OF STABILITY. BY ALLOWING THESE KIDS TO ENROLL AND REMAIN IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT BEST FITS THEIR NEEDS. THE BILL WOULD ALSO ENSURE THEY CAN RECEIVE THE TRANSPORTATION THEY NEED TO GET TO SCHOOL. THE SAME PRINCIPLE BEHIND THIS BILL THAT CERTAIN STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT AYE TO TRANSPORTERS BEEN BRACED TWICE BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. AB TWO SIX FIVE NINE WITH THE COMMITTEE BILL THAT DID THE EXACT SAME THING AS TODAY'S BILL.

THIRTY TWENTY TWO WOULD ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO GRANT HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION DIPLOMAS TO A PERSON THAT IS DEPORTED. DURING THEIR SENIOR YEAR IN HIGH SCHOOL. ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ESTIMATES THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS ATTEND CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS INCLUDING SOME TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOCTOR RECIPIENTS. DESPITE THEIR EFFORTS MANY OF HOUSTON'S FACE UNCERTAINTY IN THEIR FUTURES GIVEN THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION SKILLED UP DEPORTATION EFFORTS. THE STUDENT GETS DEPORTED THEY'LL FACE JOB AN EDUCATIONAL BARRIERS WITHOUT A PROPER EDUCATIONAL CREDENTIAL ESPECIALLY IF THEY DON'T SPEAK THE LANGUAGE LANGUAGE BEING SPANISH IF THEY'RE. THEY'VE LIVED THEIR WHOLE LIFE HERE OR HAVE ANY CONNECTION TO THEIR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN. WE SHOULD NOT STRIP STUDENTS FROM THEIR A FUTURE AND. JUST BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN DEPORTED WE SHOULD AWARD THEIR HARD WORK AND DEDICATION. AB THIRTY TWENTY WOULD HELP YOUTH WHO MAY FACE DEPORTATION BY ALLOWING SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO GRANT THEM THIS DIPLOMA IF THEY ARE IN GOOD ACADEMIC STANDING AND ARE DEPORTED ANYTIME DURING THEIR SENIOR YEAR. THIS WAS MODELED AFTER LEGISLATION THAT WAS PUT INTO A FACT DURING. THE DRAFT IN THE VIETNAM WAR AND SOMETHING THAT WE'VE DONE FOR PREVIOUS GENERATIONS UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES NONETHELESS.

KILEY AYE KALRA MCCARTY STEINORTH AYE STEINORTH AYE THURMOND THURMOND AYE WEBER. WEBER HIGH. THOSE FIVE VOTES IT IS OUT. HE WILL NOT GO TO F. ISLAND MEMBER TO AB TWO ZERO ONE ONE FILE ITEM NUMBER TWO YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY LET'S LET US PROCEED. DO WE HAVE HERE JUST. GROUP TAKE A SEAT SIR. DO YOU SEE. THANK YOU. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VERSE AND IS VERY SIMPLE BELT WITH A VERY LIMITED PURPOSE. TO ASSURE THAT EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES ACROSS THE STATE BUILT WITH PUBLIC DOLLARS TO HELP SOME OF OUR MOST UNDERSERVED STUDENTS. MILTON RELIANCE ON OUR VERY OWN DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S. GUIDANCE ARE NOT FORCED TO SHUT DOWN. BECAUSE THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN COURT DECISIONS THAT OVERRODE THE D'S INTERPRETATION. OF ALL. SO THE CDI GUIDANCE DEALT WITH PUBLIC NON CLASSROOM THE SCHOOLS AND SPECIFICALLY THOSE THAT PROVIDE WHAT'S OFTEN CALLED BLINDED WARNINGS SO PART OF THE INSTRUCTIONS ON LINE OR POEM ON THE WORKPLACE. AND PARTS IN A BRICK AND MORTAR EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES TODAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE. BRICK AND MORTAR FACILITIES ARE OFTEN CALLED RESEARCH SENATE RESOURCE CENTER THAT THAT THAT IS THE PHYSICAL SITES. IT'S THESE RESOURCE CENTERS THAT WERE THE SUBJECT OF THE CD THEY WERE THE SUBJECT OF THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN COURT DECISION UNDER THE ANDERSON DECISION. THAT AMENDED THAT GUIDANCE AND THE SUBJECT OF TODAY'S BILL. SO WHAT THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION SAID. AND IS TO THE OTHER TWO GUIDANCE IS THE CALIFORNIA LAW ALLOWSA NON CLASSROOM BASED PUBLIC SCHOOL. DECIDE UP RESOURCE CENTERS EITHER IN THE COUNTY WHERE THE SCHOOLS AUTHORIZED. OR IN AN ADJACENT COUNTY SO WHERE'S MY GRAPHIC. BASICALLY ANYTHING THERE IF THAT MIDDLE COUNTY WHICH IS SHASTA EYES WHERE THE. SCHOOL WAS AUTHORIZED YOU GET SENATOR RESOURCE CENTER A ANYTHING ANYWHERE AROUND THERE. AND OUT HUNDREDS OF SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE SERVING TENS OF THOUSANDS. STUDENTS INVESTED PUBLIC FUNDS IN RELIANCE ON THIS GUIDANCE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE STUDENTS ACCESS TO A FISCAL SITE TO MEET WITH TEACHERS RECEIVE TUTORING. DO HOMEWORK TAKE TASKS I RECEIVE ESSENTIAL SPECULATION EDUCATION SERVICES AND OTHER THINGS. SO THEN IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. AN APPELLATE COURT OVERRODE THE CD YOU GUIDANCE I THAT ALL OF THE SCHOOLS HAD RELIED UPON. AND WHAT THE COURT SAID AND THIS ACTUALLY REVERSE THE DISTRICT COURTS TO. IS THAT THESE RESOURCE CENTERS CAN BE SET UP AND COUNTIES ADJACENT TO WHERE THE SCHOOL WAS AUTHORIZED. BUT CANNOT BE SET IN THE IS SET UP IN THE COUNTY OF AUTHORIZATION ITSELF IN A LESS THE SET WITHIN THE GEOGRAPHICAL BOUNDARIES. OF ITS AUTHORIZING DISTRICT. SO THIS MEANT MANY CASES AYE AYE SCHOOL COULD OPERATE A FACILITY HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY BUT COULD NOT OPERATE THE SAME FACILITY A FEW MILES DOWN THE ROAD YOU GET THE SORT OF DON'T AT THE FACT THAT YOU SEE THERE. SO I YOU KNOW THE AND WE'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS FROM ONE OF OUR WITNESSES BUT YOU COULD SET UP A RESOURCE FACILITY IN THE RED. AND THE ORANGE BUT NOT IN THE GREAT THAT LIES IN BETWEEN. THIS DECISION REVERSED WHAT AS I SAID WITH THE DISTRICT COURT HELD AND ADOPTED A LITERALIST INTERPRETATION. OF THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN REJECTED EVEN BY ABOUT TEXTUAL US LIKE JUSTICE SCALIA OR EAT OUT BECAUSE EVEN TAX LIST WILL ALLOW SOME FLEXIBILITY TO CORRECT DRAFTING ERRORS AND AVOID ABSURD RESULTS. BUT RESULT WHAT RESULTED IN THIS CASE WAS A RESULT OF THE DISTRICT COURT CHARACTERIZED AS ABSURD JUST LOOK AT THE GRAPHIC. CLEARLY ABSURD IT DEFIED THE CD'S INTERPRETATION OF THE STATUTE AND COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN WHAT THE LEGISLATURE INTENDED. AS A RESULT UNIVERISTY GO SPEAK TO THE BILL. THE BILL WHICH YOU WANT TO DO HERE TODAY AND I DON'T ABOUT COURT CASES AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO SPEAK TO THE BILL PLEASE OKAY I DON'T THINK WE'LL BE I AM SPEAKING AS WELL. WHAT WOULD YOU STATE ALREADY IS ARGUABLE SO WAS PLEASE SPEAK TO THE BILL? OKAY I'LL CONTINUE SPEAKING TO THE BILL AS A RESULT APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED TWENTY NINE RESOURCE THAT RESOURCE CENTERS WITH THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES. AND AROUND THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND PUBLIC SCHOOL CHILDREN REACHING FROM SAN DIEGO COUNTY TO MODOC COUNTY HAVE BEEN PLACED IN LEGAL LIMBO. TODAY'S BILL IS ONLY PURPOSE IS TO ALLOW THOSE RESOURCE CENTERS TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE IS REQUIRED BY THE STATE. NOW A QUICK WORD ABOUT THE THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND STUDENTS WHOSE FUTURES DEPEND ON HOW YOU VOTE TODAY. MORE THAN SIXTY THREE PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS ARE SOCIO ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED AND QUALIFY FOR FREE OR REDUCED PRICE MEALS AND MORE THAN FORTY SIX PERCENT ARE LATINO OR AFRICAN AMERICAN. NINETY PERCENT OF THESE RESOURCE CENTERS ARE USED TO DELIVER SERVICES TO SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS. MANY OF THE STUDENTS SERVED A RISK OF DROPPING OUT OF SCHOOL OR HAVE PREVIOUSLY DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL AND ARE LOOKING FOR AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD TO FINISH THEIR INITIATION. MANY STUDENTS CHOOSE ARE A. INTERSCOPE INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAM TO GET AS THEIR ONLY MEANS TO OBTAIN A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA AND WORKPLACE SKILLS. ESPECIALLY TRUE IN RURAL AREAS. THE PEDAGOGICAL FUNK FOUNDATION OF THE SCHOOLS RELIES ON THEIR ABILITY TO PLACE FACILITIES AT REASONABLE DISTANCES FOR THEIR STUDENTS. THOUGHTS THE INABILITY TO CREATE ACCESSIBLE FACILITIES WILL MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR MANY OF THEM TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY. FURTHER IN THE ABSENCE OF TODAY'S BELL MORE MAY BE FORCED TO BECOME A VIRTUAL SCHOOLS AS THE BRICK AND MORTAR COMPONENT OF BLENDED LEARNING. WILL BE ELIMINATED. THE COMMITTEE HAS RAISED CONCERNS THIS BILL WELL SOMEHOW REMOVE GEOGRAPHICAL RESTRICTIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN STATUTE. AND ALLOW FOR RESOURCE CENTER IS A POP UP ANYWHERE IN THE STATE. I WANT TO BE UNEQUIVOCAL. THAT IS NOT THE INTENT. THIS BILL. IN FACT. THE BILL WAS NOT EVEN INTENDED FOR RESERVE REVERSED THE COURT DECISION. ALL WE'RE LOOKING TO DO IS GRANDFATHER IN THE EXISTING RESOURCE CENTERS THAT WERE SET UP IN RELIANCE ON THE CD GUIDANCE. SO THAT THESE FACILITIES ARE NOT FORCED TO SHUT DOWN WITH ALL OF THOSE STUDENTS AND EMPLOYEES LEFT IN THE LURCH. TO THE EXTENT OF THE CURRENT LANGUAGE OF THE BILL DOES MORE THAN THAT WHICH I DON'T BELIEVE IT DOES. I NONE THE LESS COMMIT TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE TO ITS FULL SATISFACTION. TO MAKE IT PELLUCID LI CLEAR THAT THE BILL ALLOWS FOR THE CONTINUED OPERATION OF THE INNER COUNTY OUT OF DISTRICT RESOURCE CENTERS AFFECTED BY THE ANDERSON DECISION. NOTHING MORE NOTHING LESS I ASKED YOU DON'T FORCE THE CENTERS THE SHUTDOWN I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. JOINING ME TODAY IS THAT CYNTHIA RACHEL SHE'S A TEACHER ADMINISTRATOR FOR INNOVATIVE EDUCATION MANAGEMENT SCHOOLS AND I APRIL ANDERSON AND HER SON AYE MICHAEL ANDERSON AS WELL AND DIE INTRODUCING THEM VERY BRIEFLY. I WILL BE JEFF RICE. ON BEHALF OF THE A PLUS THANK YOU HAVE FOUR MINUTES FOR. TWO WITNESSES. THANK YOU JUST TO INTRODUCE MYSELF I'M JEFF RICE FOUNDER AND DIRECTOR OF THE A PLUS PERSONALIZED LEARNING NETWORK ASSOCIATION AND THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL AND I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ON THE SCOPE AND. AND INTENT OF THIS BILL SO I WANT TO TURN THIS OVER NOW TO CYNTHIA RACHEL. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AS MENTIONED I'M CYNTHIA RACHEL DIRECTOR OF EDUCATION SUPPORT SERVICES AND MY SCHOOLS REPRESENT SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. WE'RE HERE BECAUSE OF THE RECENT APPELLATE DECISION AND HOW IT OVERTURNED THE FOURTEEN YEARS OF PRECEDENTS REGARDING ON CLASSROOM BASED. RESOURCE CENTER LOCATIONS WITHIN AUTHORIZING COUNTY OF A CHARTER SCHOOL. AS NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS WE ARE ABLE TO SERVE STUDENTS IN THE COUNTIES IN WHICH THE CHARTER IS AUTHORIZED AS WELL AS THE ADJACENT COUNTIES. ADJACENT COUNTIES AS MENTIONED THE APPELLATE DECISION CREATED THIS DON'T AFFECT THAT YOU CAN SEE ON THE VISUAL HERE IN THIS CASE SHASTA COUNTY CONSERVE. STUDENT SHASTA TRIP SECONDARY HOME SCHOOL CONSERVE STUDENTS AND LOCATE RESOURCE CENTER FACILITIES IN THE RED AREA AND THE ORANGE AREA. WHILE THEY CAN SERVE BUT NOT LOCATE RESOURCE CENTER IS LOCATED IN THE GRAY AREA WITHIN SHASTA COUNTY. AB TWENTY ELEVEN FIXES THIS PROBLEM BY ALLOWING NON CLASSROOM THE SCHOOLS TO LOCATE FACILITIES FOR STATE MANDATED EDUCATIONAL SERVICES IN THIS GRAY AREA. FOR MY SCHOOL AND MANY SCHOOLS IN THE STATE THE SITUATION IS VERY DIRE ONE IN PARTICULAR SKY MOUNTAIN CHARTER SCHOOL IS AUTHORIZED IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY THIS COUNTY COVERS TWENTY THOUSAND SQUARE MILES. WELL ARE AUTHORIZING DISTRICT ONLY ACCOUNTS FOR SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE SQUARE MILES CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING EXPECTED TO DRIVE UPWARDS OF A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILES EACH WAY TO RECEIVE SPECIAL EDUCATION EARLY LINK ENGLISH LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT SERVICES ON A REGULAR BASIS. UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE APPELLATE DECISION HAS FORCED MANY OF OUR STUDENTS TO DO OR AS SCHOOLS TO MAKE IT MORE FEASIBLE WE'VE BEEN FORCED TO CONTRACT OUT FOR EDUCATIONAL SERVICES OR THIRD PARTY FACILITIES THAT ARE CLOSER TO THE STUDENTS HOMES. WHICH HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED COSTS AND LESS CONTINUITY OF INSTRUCTION FOR STUDENTS WITH THE GREATEST NEED. AB TWENTY ELEVEN PLEASE SUMMARIZE SO THE OTHER WITNESSES WILL STILL OF TIME. AB TWENTY ELEVEN SEEKS TO PROVIDE ALL STUDENTS WE SERVE WITH THE STATE MANDATED SERVICES WITHIN A REASONABLE DRIVING DISTANCE OF THEIR HOME THINK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS.

PLEASE. WE GET CLEARED UP IN FRONT THEY'RE GONNA COME AND SIT AT THE DESK THERE THANK YOU YOU MAY. RECEIVE HONORING. GOOD AFTERNOON CALL SPECIAL WITH CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION. WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE OF THIS MEASURE. OUR DISTRICTS HAVE HIGH. THOUGHT THIS ISSUE IN THE IN THE COURTS. WE'VE HAD THE. DECISION BY THE APPELLATE COURT. WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE LOCAL CONTROL ISSUE OR CONCERN THAT THESE FACILITIES AND UP IN DISTRICTS WHERE. THOSE BOARDS HAVE NOT HAD THE BILL EITHER BE NOTIFIED OF THESE FACILITIES OR HAD THE OPTION TO PROVE THEM. WE. WOULD RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE AUTHOR THAT. WITHOUT APPROVING THIS BILL THAT THEY WOULD LEAVE THESE TO SORT THE CURRENT FACILITIES AND LIMBO. THERE'S NO OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE. I CHARTER SCHOOLS TO SEEK THE APPROVAL OF THE DISTRICTS I GOT THERE AT THAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY LOCATED IN. THAT GEOGRAPHIC RESTRICTIONS IN STATUTE. HAVE A PURPOSE. THE PURPOSE IS TO. ALLOW AUTHORIZES JAAP TEAM TO PROVIDE. HOT RIGOROUS OVERSIGHT. WITHOUT THE RESTRICTIONS THAT SIDE. THAT THIS BILL WOULD ELIMINATE. THE. IT WOULD MAKE IT VERY MUCH WOULD BE MAKE IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR AUTHORIZES TO PROVIDE THE ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT THAT. AND THAT MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE HAVE HAVE SOUGHT TO. EMPOWER. AND WE COULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR. AND. DOES AUTHORIZES ENSURE THAT THE STUDENTS ARE RECEIVING. THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED IDEA TO BE ABLE TO DO THE. REQUIRED ANNUAL AND SPIN. SITE VISIT THAT'S REQUIRED IN STATUTE. AND. BETTER YET THE MULTIPLE SITE VISITS AT A RECOMMENDED THAT AUTHORIZES TO. IT'S FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE MUST RESPECT THE POSIBLE AND. AVAILABLE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS SUB BRAMBLE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION RESPECT WHEN OPPOSITION. WELL WE DID CO SPONSOR A BILL LAST YEAR SENATE BILL EIGHT OH EIGHT. WHICH REQUIRED ALL CHARTER SCHOOLS BE LOCATED WITHIN THEIR AUTHORIZING DISTRICT AND I NOTE IN THE ANALYSIS THAT DOES SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT. THE BLURRED LINES SOMETIMES THAT OCCUR BETWEEN A SATELLITE CAMPUS IN THE CHARTER SCHOOL ASIDE FROM THE OVERSIGHT ISSUE THAT THE SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION RAISED THREE MORE REASONS WHY. ALLOWING THE CHARTER SCHOOL OUR SATELLITE CAMPUS TO LOCATE OUTSIDE THE DISTRICT IS BAD POLICY NUMBER ONE. OUR CHARTER PETITIONS MUST DEMONSTRATE INTEREST OF TEACHERS STUDENTS FAMILIES WHERE THEY'RE LOCATED AND PETITION SIGNATURES INDICATE THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE INTERESTED MEANINGFULLY IN EITHER TEACHING AT OR HAVING THEIR CHILDREN ATTEND THE PROPOSED SCHOOL SO IF YOU ALLOW. A SATELLITE LOCATIONS TO POP OUT WITHOUT SUBMITTING A NEW CHARTER SCHOOL PETITION THAT CREATES THE VERY REAL POSSIBILITY THAT THERE IS NOT COMMUNITY SUPPORT FOR THE SCHOOL. AND THAT THERE WILL BE AN INABILITY TO HIRE QUALIFIED TEACHERS NUMBER TWO. KIDS OUTSIDE THE DISTRICT WILL RETURN TO THE DISTRICT OF RESIDENTS OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL CLOSES SO THE DISTRICT OF RESIDENCE DOES HAVE A STAKE. IN WHETHER STUDENTS ARE LEARNING ANYTHING OR WHETHER THEY WILL HAVE TO MAKE UP FOR LOST YEAR OF MATH INSTRUCTION A CHARTER WHO WANTS OPERATE IN SOME OF THE DISTRICT SHOULD GO TO THAT BOARD AND SEEK AUTHORIZATION THE NUMBER THREE. HOW PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANT IS THE ACCOUNTABILITY PIECE? LIST CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR RECENTLY DID A DEEP DIVE INTO CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN IN A PROPERLY AUTHORIZED OUTSIDE OF THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT I'M QUOTING FROM THE REPORT IT READS QUOTE. BECAUSE THE RESIDENTS NEAR THE LOCATION OF AN OUT OF DISTRICT SCHOOL CANNOT VOTE FOR AUTHORIZING DISTRICTS BOARD MEMBERS A DISTRICT THAT AUTHORIZES THAT OUT OF DISTRICT SCHOOL. IS NOT ACCOUNTABILITY IS NOT ACCOUNTABLE TO THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH THE SCHOOL IS LOCATED AND IN ADDITION TO DISTRICTS IN WHICH THE OUT OF SCHOOL. OUT OF DISTRICT SCHOOLS ARE LOCATED OR HOST DISTRICTS DON'T HAVE THE MEANS OF CHALLENGING THE SCHOOLS AUTHORIZATIONS I DID. SPEAK YESTERDAY WITH THE CHIEF COUNSEL OF THE STATE BOARD OF ED AND I NOTICED THAT THE AUTHOR MENTIONED CD GUIDANCE IN THE ANDERSON CASE AND GRANDFATHER AND. COUNCIL. INFORM ME THAT THEY'VE GIVEN FOLKS A FULL YEAR TO GET IN COMPLIANCE WITH. THIS CASE AND THAT THEY'RE ENCOURAGED TO REACH OUT TO THEIR DISTRICT WHERE THEY'RE LOCATED AND SEEK AUTHORIZATION SO IT'S BAD POLICY FRANKLY WE'RE GENOVA. THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS STILL ARE STRAND FLOORS CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION ALSO IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TRISTEN BROWN OF THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. AS CHAIR MEMBERS MICHAEL YOUNG WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO HERE IN OPPOSITION. I JACKSON WAS SENDING UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU WILL GO BEHIND NO IGNORE THEIR OPPOSITION WILL BRING BEHIND THE REAL HERE. MISTER COLLIER Y.. TO MY THOUGHTS ON THIS THIS. WE HEAR TALK ABOUT THE DONOR HOLE THAT THIS BILL DOES MUCH MUCH MORE THAN THAT. AND THAT MAY EVEN YOU KNOW IN THE OPINION OF SOME BE THE TRUE INTENT OF THE BILL. NONE OF THE SCHOOLS HAVE ASKED FOR A WAIVER INDICATING THEY'VE COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE ANDERSON CASE THEY ARE IN COMPLIANCE NOW. AND THE STATE ALREADY HAS A PROCESS. THE LAW ALREADY PROVIDES A WAY FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS TO OPEN RESOURCE CENTERS WITHIN THE COUNTY OTHER AUTHORIZING ENTITY. JUST SUBMIT A PROPOSAL FOR A COUNTY WIDE BENEFIT CHARTER. SO THERE'S A PROCESS NOW UNDER SHOULD BE A PROCESS SPEAK FOR OVERSIGHT REASONS ALONE. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN CONCERNS I HAVE WE START. OPERATING SINGS IN FAR OFF. YOU KNOW. GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS IT'S THE LACK OF OVERSIGHT AND OFF OFTEN ACCOUNTABILITY TO BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT MANY OF THESE VIRTUAL SCHOOLS THE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE IS IS IS IS IS NOT AT ALL ABOVE AVERAGE NOT AT ALL. SO WHY. TO DISRUPT ANYONE WISH TO COMMENT ON THE. OKAY DOT TALKING OPPORTUNITY FOR A AROUND IT WOULD ASSIST COMMON THANK YOU. NUMBER ONE THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS NOT TO ADDRESS VIRTUAL SCHOOLS AT ALL. VIRTUAL SCHOOLS BY REGULATORY DEFINITION. OUR SCHOOLS THAT. OFFER IT LEAST EIGHTY PERCENT OR MORE OF INSTRUCTION ONLINE. THEREFORE THEY HAVE NO NEED FOR RESOURCE CENTER FACILITIES BECAUSE ALL THEIR INSTRUCTION IS TAKING PLACE ONLINE. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR INDEPENDENT STUDY? CHARTER SCHOOLS AND THAT IS A ARE MANY TYPES OF INSTRUCTIONAL MODELS PERSONALIZED LEARNING. HOME SCHOOLING INDEPENDENT STUDY HYBRID IN BLENDED MODELS ALL OF WHICH INCORPORATE AND INTEGRATE FACILITIES TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. CRITICAL EDUCATION SERVICES THAT STUDENTS NEED. SO THE IDEA THAT THIS IS TIED TO VIRTUAL SCHOOLS. IS SIMPLY FALSE IT IS NOT TIED TO VIRTUAL SCHOOLS. NUMBER TWO. ENROLLMENT IN INDEPENDENT STUDY CHARTER SCHOOLS IS ALLOWED THROUGH INDEPENDENT STUDY STATUTE AS FOLLOWS. ALL NON CLASSROOM BASED INDEPENDENT STUDY CHARTER SCHOOLS MAY ENROLL STUDENTS WHO RESIDE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY IN WHICH THE CHARTER SCHOOLS AUTHORIZED. AND IN ANY ADJACENT COUNTY TO WHICH THE CHARTER SCHOOL IS AUTHORIZED. BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED. THROUGH THOSE INDEPENDENT STUDY CHARTER SCHOOLS IT IS ESSENTIAL BECAUSE OF THE BLENDED NATURE OF OFFERING A COMBINATION OF INDEPENDENT STUDY HOME SCHOOLING. SITE CLASSES AND ONLINE CLASSES AND TUTORING AND TEACHER ASSISTANTS THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO FACILITIES WITHIN A REACHED REASONABLE DISTANCE. TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE CRITICAL SERVICES SUCH AS THE ONES THAT WE PROPOSE IN THIS BILL WHICH ARE LIMITED TO. TESTING AND ASSESSMENT AND SPECIAL EDUCATION AND SPECIAL NEEDS SERVICES AN ENGLISH LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT SERVICES. AND SCIENCE LABS FOR YOU SEE AG COURSES PERIOD. ALL THIS BILL IS DOING IS PROVIDING REASONABLE ACCESS FOR THE PUPILS WHO HAPPEN TO LIVE IN THE COUNTY IN WHICH THEIR AUTHOR THEIR CHARTER SCHOOLS AUTHORIZED. BUT AT A GREAT DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE GEOGRAPHICAL BOUNDARIES OF THE AUTHORIZING DISTRICT. BECAUSE THESE CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE ALREADY AUTHORIZED TO BE ABLE TO PLACE A RESOURCE CENTER IN AN ADJACENT COUNTY. THE IDEA THAT. LOCAL CONTROL IS BEING VIOLATED BY BEING ABLE TO PLACE A RESOURCE CENTER IN COUNTY IS NOT RELEVANT AT ALL GIVEN THE DISTANCE. SO I BELIEVE THAT ANSWERS ALL OF YOUR QUESTION. I DON'T KNOW THAT I AGREE WITH YOU BUT THANK YOU. THAT'S THE FACT THE OPPOSITION WISH TO COMMENT ON THAT AT ALL. MISTER CHAIR I WOULD JUST SAY IN TERMS OF THE DEFINITION OF NON CLASSROOM BASED INSTRUCTION VIRTUAL. ONLINE INSTRUCTION IS INCLUDED SO I'M NOT SURE WHY THERE'S A CONVERSATION THAT THIS DOESN'T INCLUDE ONLINE INSTRUCTION I THINK IN GENERAL WHY. THE. YOU KNOW ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE MAY THAT IS THEIRS AND IT CERTAINLY FOR VIRTUAL CHARTERS. HAS TO BE SOMEONE IS VERY SELF MOTIVATED TO HAVE TO BE YOU KNOW IT'S OUT OLYMPIANS OUT ACTOR. YOU KNOW SOMEONE SOMETIME TO SOCIALLY AWKWARD WHO WHO'S VERY INDEPENDENT THEY CAN PERFORM VERY WELL BUT BECAUSE AND TIMES SOMETIMES HAS BEEN REALLY CAST A BROAD NET ABOUT WHO CAN. WHO IS A SOUGHT OUT TO PUT? UTILIZE VIRTUAL CHARTERS SOMETIMES IT MAY BE SOMEONE WHO NEEDS MORE SUPPORT AND IS GONNA GET LESS IN AN ONLINE ENVIRONMENT AS A RESULT MAYBE THEY'RE PLAYING VIDEO GAMES INSTEAD OF DOING INSTRUCTION SO THAT'S SOME OF WHAT YOU'RE SEEING THEIR. IN THE DATA BUT CERTAINLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS IS. A FOUR NINE CLASS IN BASS CHARTERS THAT WOULD INCLUDE. VIRTUAL CHARTERS. THANK YOU. OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AND SITTING NOT THAT I WANT TO ASK A QUESTION BECAUSE NOW I'M ALL I AM TO LOOK CONFUSED. WHO TRYING TO CLARITY IF I LOOK AT YOUR LITTLE MATH THAT'S THERE? YOUR CONCERN IS THAT NOW THE RED AREA I GUESS IS THAT AT COUNTY WITHIN. SOME AREA IS IS THAT THEY ARE OR THAT I WAS THE DISTRICT BOUNDARIES FOR THAT PARTICULAR SPOKEN THAT'S DISTRICT BOUNDARY FOR THAT SCHOOL OKAY. AND THAT'S ALL IN SHASTA COUNTY YEAH SO THAT'S. YOUR CONCERN IS THAT. YOU CAN PUT THESE THOMAS CENTERS IN IN THE ORANGE AREA ORANGE AND RED ONES IN RICH BUT NOT THE GRAY BUT YOU CAN'T PUT A CENTER IN SHASTA COUNTY IS THAT THE CONCERNED YOU CAN'T PUT A CENTER IN SHASTA COUNTY. OUTSIDE THE READ IN THOSE GRAY ERRORS LITTLE GRAY AREA YES MA'AM AND THAT'S BECAUSE BECAUSE OF THE APPELLATE COURT. INTERPRETATION OF CURRENT STATUTE. OKAY SO. OKAY SO THAT THE SO YOU NOT CAN. ACCORDING TO YOUR ARGUMENT YOU NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THE REST OF THE STATE YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PIECE OF. THE LAND THAT'S WITHIN SHASTA COUNTY CORRECT OKAY THAT'S NOT VERY CLEAR FROM WHAT IS WRITTEN HERE AND THAT'S WHY. I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND. AND. YEAH IT IT IT'S VERY CONFUSING AS THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN SO AS I TRY TO FIGURE OUT SO YOU REALLY THE LITTLE AREA THERE YES WHEN YOU'RE ASKING TO GRANDFATHER THOSE AND THERE ARE CENTERS ALREADY IN THOSE AREAS NOW IS THAT THE ISSUE. OKAY AND YOU ASKING AVOID LIMIT RULING TO BASICALLY DEAL WITH THE INSIDE OF SHASTA COUNTY. OR ANY COUNTY IN WHICH A NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOL IS AN EXISTING NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS CURRENTLY OPERATING AND HAS HAD RESOURCE AND IS THERE. OUTSIDE OF THE DISTRICT BOUNDARIES BUT WITHIN THE COUNTY. YOU KNOW HOW MANY ARE THERE. WE ASSUME THAT THERE ARE SOMEWHERE. BY TODAY'S STANDARDS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIFTY AND A HUNDRED. NOT THE HEART OF THE BILLS THIS. I'M READING FROM THE BILL NON CLASSROOM BASED. DESTRUCTION SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE GEOGRAPHICAL RESTRICTIONS SO THIS IS LIKE THE WILD WEST ROOM OPENING THIS UP. WELL THERE ARE ALREADY RESTRICTIONS IN PLACE REGARDING WHERE STUDENTS CAN BE ENROLLED SO WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT THE COUNTY IN WHICH. CHARTER SCHOOLS AUTHORIZED IN ANY ADJACENT COUNTY THERE'S ALREADY EXCEPT AN EXCEPTION IN STATUTE THAT ALLOWS FOR RESOURCE CENTERS TO BE LOCATED IN AN ADJACENT COUNTY SO WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT THE COUNTY IN WHICH. THE CHARTER SCHOOLS AUTHORIZED AND ONLY BE ON THE DISTRICT BOUNDARIES AND TO THE CLOUD OF THOSE LAWS YOU CITED DON'T APPLY HERE. WHAT LOWER RIVER IF I'M READING THE BILL CORRECTLY? THE OTHER LAWYER THE OTHER. THE OTHER LAWYER DECIDED DOES NOT IS NOT APPLICABLE. REVISTA RATING THAT ESSENTIALLY. MISTER CHAIR. WELL NOT WITHSTANDING IS A KEY WORD. WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT FORCE AND SIX OH FIVE FOUR SEVEN SIX OH FIVE POINT ONE. AND AUTHORITIES DIDN'T ANSWER THAT'S WHERE THE EXEMPTION LINE LET ME JUST AND I REITERATE MY COMMITMENT THAT IF YOU DISAGREE WITH OUR INTERPRETATION WE'LL FIX IT TO MAKE SURE THIS BILL DOES NOTHING MORE. THAN TO SAY THAT THESE CENTERS THAT ARE IN THE MIDDLE THE DOWN OUT THERE AYE THAT GRAY AREA ARE NOT FORCED TO SHUT DOWN. PULL THIS BILL GOES INTO NAVY AUTHORIZED SHOULD THEY HAVE OVERSIGHT THAT'S MY CONCERN TO DO THE OPPOSITION WHICH THIS WEEK. JUST TO BRIEFLY. CORRECT SOMETHING I HEARD IN THE CURRENT LAW DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO SET. RESOURCE CENTERS AND CONTIGUOUS COUNTIES WHAT IT ALLOWS ITS ME A RESOURCE ONE RESOURCE CENTER IN IN THE CONTIGUOUS COUNTY NOT NOT MULTIPLE AND SO WHAT AGAIN WHAT THE STATE BOARD HAS SAID ESSENTIALLY IS YOU HAVE A YEAR. IF YOU'RE LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE DISTRICT TO SEEK AUTHORIZATION FROM THE DISTRICT WHERE YOU'RE SITTING. AND SO THAT WAS INTENDED TO PROVIDE ENOUGH TIME TO GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE APPEAL PROCESS IF NEEDED. FOLKS NEED TO SEEK OUT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WHERE THEY'RE SITTING AND SEEK AUTHORIZATION AND THAT WAS DONE. THAT WOULD THAT THEY WERE GIVEN A YEAR AND AND THAT WAS JAY LENO ONE'S APPLY FOR A WAIVER SO THEY DID. SO YEAH THEY'RE OPERATING DOZENS ON LIVE FOR WAIVERS. DOESN'T THE SECOND IN A PLAGUE OF THE SECOND. TO DO THAT. THEY HAVEN'T YET. APPLIED FOR A SECOND WAY RIGHT RIGHT WHICH SO WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE A SECOND THING RETURNED FOR SO I'D THERE MAY BE SOME OTHER. QUESTIONS HERE. DETERMINE. AND YOU KNOW JUST JUST IT. JUST LOOKING AT ME. THAT THE LANGUAGE HERE IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I'M READING IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I SEE. WHAT I SEE IS REASONABLE? AND IN TERMS OF THAT WHAT I READ IS SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT IN THAT'S HERE SO IT MAKES IT VERY CONFUSING. BECAUSE IT I MEAN TO ME IT WOULD BE LOGICAL TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP. A CENTER IT IN THE SAME COUNTY WHICH IS MAKES MORE SENSE FOR PEOPLE IN THAT DISTRICT THAN IT DOES TO ALL THESE OTHER COUNTIES THAT TOUCH IT BECAUSE THE METS. MORE DRIVING TIME AND SO FORTH AND SO ON SO IT IS. IT BUT IT DOESN'T SAY THAT HERE THAT'S THE PROBLEM I HAVE WHEN I READ THIS I'M KIND OF CONFUSED AND NOT SURE WHAT WITH IN DEALING WITH. VIRTUAL CHARTER THAT HAVE NO SPACE WHERE THEY CAN OPEN THESE THINGS ANYWHERE IN THE STATE IN THE IN THE STATE BECAUSE OF SAYS. YOU KNOW A A BEING EXEMPT FROM EXISTING GEOGRAPHICAL RESTRICTIONS COULD BE YOU KNOW HAVING A SCHOOL IN OREGON SOMEWHERE BECAUSE THOSE GEOGRAPHICAL. STRICT XIN SO IT DOESN'T SAY WHAT I THINK YOU'RE INTENDING TO SAY. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX IT IN TERMS OF THIS AT THIS TIME. YOU KNOW BUT DOES. IT IT'S BUT TO ME IT'S REASONABLE THAT WOULD BE UP WITHIN YOUR COUNTY BECAUSE IT'S OBSCENE YOU CAN GET THERE FASTER YOU KNOW AND IT'S AN AND THE KIDS OF IT. AND I I'M REALLY INTO MAKING SURE THAT. WHATEVER WE DO IS CLOSE ENOUGH SO THAT THERE'S SOME ACCOUNTABILITY FOR WHAT'S HAPPENING THAT THOSE WHO AUTHORIZED CHARTERS CAN VISIT IT AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S DOING WHAT SUPPOSED TO DO AND ALL PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE. SO SEEMS TO ME IF IT'S IF IT'S IN THE SAME COUNTY TO MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE. BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE OF WHAT IS WRITTEN HERE AND THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO GO ON. AND. ANYWAY. SO I I HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY WITH I MEAN JUST OUT THE BILL'S ADVOCATES HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH IT. AND NOT BEING ABLE TO FIX IT AND I KNOW IT'S VERY CONFLICT COMPLICATE WITH LOT OF THE DISCUSSION THAT'S GOING ON. BUT IT'S IT'S NOT CLEAR IN TERMS WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S WRITTEN ON STAFF THANK YOU SO I I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE GOING TO THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS OF THE THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL. THE ISSUE AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE THE IMPRESSION YOU HAVE. AYE SEPARATE SEPARATELY THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS ON. WHAT STUDENTS CAN ENROLL IN AND I IN A NON COSTS ARE BASED ON A CHARTER BUT IT'S LET'S BE CLEAR THAT AGAIN I'M GOING TO ASK THERE IS A THREAD ON THERE? LISTEN THERE IS A PROCESS NOW. ALSO I NEED TO GO IS THE COUNTY IN OF THE COUNTY WHITE BENEFIT. WELL I WANT EXCUSE ME THAT'LL BE A COUNTY WIDE BENEFIT CHARTERS A PROCESS NOW THAT CAN BE EMPLOYED SHOULD THEY CHOOSE TO. PP EXCUSE ME STUDENT CALL ON ONE. EXCUSE ME EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME. PLEASE. SAY WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY. I AM THE CHAIR. I'M AND I WOULD JUST CLARIFY THAT EXISTS A PROCESS NOW. DONE WE DON'T NEED A NEW LAW. DO IT. YEAH ADDRESS STOCKBROKERS QUESTIONS YOUR. YES THANK YOU SO AYE SEPARATELY THERE ARE LIMITATIONS ON ENROLLMENT SO I STUDENT CAN ONLY ENROLL IN A NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER IN IN THEIR OWN COUNTY. OR ANNA JASON COUNTY SO WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT. TAKING WAY GEOGRAPHICAL RESTRICTIONS I GUESS IT'S TRUE AS THE WAY THE BILL'S RIGHT NOW IN THEORY THIS SHASTA BASED US SCHOOL COULD OPEN A RESOURCE CENTER IN SAN DIEGO WHERE YOU COULDN'T ENROLL ANY STUDENTS FROM SAN DIEGO OR ANYWHERE THERE YOU CAN ONLY ENROLL THEM. FROM THE AREAS THAT ON THE MAP THAT'S WHY AND MAYBE THE COMMITTEE DISMISSED THIS IN THE ANALYSIS THAT'S WHY THE ANALYSIS DOESN'T REALLY. HOLD WATER BUT IF WE DISAGREE ON THAT I WOULDN'T SAY AND I'M STATE ON THE RECORD RIGHT NOW MY INTENDED JUST TO HELP OUT FOLKS I LIKE THE ONES WHO HAVE COME HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY. WHO ARE GONNA BE OUT OF LUCK AND HAVE THE RESOURCE CENTER SHUT DOWN? AND IN MANY CASES HAVE THEIR SCHOOL BECOME MORE VIRTUAL AND HOT LESS VIRTUAL. BECAUSE OF THIS COURT DECISION THAT IS UP ENDED. A LAW THEY RELIED. THANK YOU. I'M ANY OTHER. THANK YOU SO CHAIR. TO THE AUTHOR OR TWO WITNESSES CHIU. I'M ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE BILL LANGUAGE AND IF YOU YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO ADDRESS THE CHAIRS QUESTION TO YOU OR STATEMENT THAT THERE IS A PROCESS. I AM CURIOUS IF THERE IS A PROCESS. HAS HAS ANYONE AVAIL THEMSELVES TO THAT PROCESS AND IF NOT WHY. ALL OF THAT ADDRESS THE SPECIFICS OF THIS WHAT HE WHAT HE SEEMED TO BE SAYING IS WHILE YOU DON'T GO OUT AND GET SEPARATE AUTHORIZATIONS. FROM SEPARATE SCHOOL DISTRICTS OR COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION FOR ALL OF THE RESOURCE CENTERS YOU HAVE IN ADDITION TO THE ORIGINAL AUTHORIZATION YOU HAVE FOR THE ACTUAL SCHOOL. AND AYE YES IN THEORY THAT CAN BE DONE I THINK IT HAS BEEN BEEN DONE I MISTER REISS PERHAPS CAN CORRECT ME BUT I THINK WHAT THEOPPOSITION IS CONCERNED ABOUT IS ACCOUNTABILITY ACTUALLY THAT BALKANIZED ACCOUNTABILITY. NOW SUDDENLY YOU OF MULTIPLE AUTHORIZES WHO ARE PLAYING IN THE OVERSIGHT ROLE. FOR ONE SCHOOL BUT I'VE YOU GUYS HAVE MORE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES ALL OUT FOR YOU WELL I CAN SAY THAT DOZENS OF SCHOOL. SCHOOLS WHO HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO HAD NEEDING TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPELLATE COURT DECISION. HAVE SOUGHT TO VARYING DEGREES BECAUSE IT WAS A IT WAS A REQUIREMENT OF THE WAIVER BY THE STATE BOARD. THAT THEY COME UP WITH A. TRANSITIONAL CONTINGENCY PLAN TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE OVER THE YEARS PERIOD. SOME OF THEM HAVE SOUGHT THEIR FOR. A NEW CHARTER SCHOOL AUTHORIZATIONS THROUGH DISTRICTS AS WELL AS THROUGH COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AS MR O'DONNELL SUGGEST. THAT HAS. COME WITH MIXED RESULTS. SOME HAVE BEEN MET WITH RECEPTIVITY. AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN MET WITH PICKS DREAM HOSTILITY. IN FACT TOLD AT THE DOOR THAT THEY WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM AND THEY WOULD NOT EVEN LOOK AT THEIR CHARTER PETITION LET ALONE CONSIDERATE. SO. WHILE IN THEORY IT'S A WONDERFUL OPTION. PRACTICAL APPLICATION IT HAS MIXED RESULTS. THE OTHER. THE OTHER THING TO POINT OUT IS THAT. WITH THE DISTRICT AUTHORIZED CHARTER SCHOOL. SOMETIMES IT'S. IT'S NOT. FISCALLY POSSIBLE. TO GO TO ANOTHER DISTRICT WHERE MAYBE ONLY TWENTY OR THIRTY OR FORTY OR FIFTY STUDENTS ARE BEING SERVED. IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA AND GET A NEW CHARTER SCHOOL AUTHORIZED THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN ITSELF. SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. PERHAPS THE DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE CURRENT AUTHORIZD CHARTER THAT SERVING. A FEW DOZEN STUDENTS AND. THAT AS A SEPARATE CHARTER WOULD NOT BE FINANCIALLY SUSTAINABLE BUT YOU STILL NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THOSE STUDENTS AND YOU DO SO WITH THE EXISTING CHARTER. WITH A RESOURCE CENTER IN ADVANCE SO ARE GOING AND AND THAT'S WHERE YOU CAN HAVE THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS A DIFFERENT. YES RICE. YOU YOU. WERE. GIVING. SORT OF THE BACKGROUND. AND I WAS FOLLOWING YOU. AND THEN I WAS IN THE AWKWARD YOU LOSE IT WHEN TO LOSE NOW. ATHLETIC. USUALLY FOR ME THE MORE WE TALK ABOUT IT THE BETTER YES IN THERE SOMEWHERE I FELL INTO A HOLE AND I'M STILL IN IT OF WIRELESS POINT OUT. WELL GLORIA HOW CAN I HELP WELL I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU SAY THAT. YOU AGREE THAT THE LAW. ALLOWS. A BLENDED LEARNING SCHOOL. I FOLLOWED YOU SEE YEAH YOU GOT IT. TO OPEN A RESOURCE CENTER. IN. COUNTY WORDS AUTHORIZE. GOING TO JC CAN A COUNTY ADJACENT TO WHERE IT'S AUTHORIZED WITHIN THE AUTHORIZING DISTRICT DISTRICT. IF THE INDUSTRY IN THE AUTHORIZING DISHES BOUNDARIES YES OKAY AND AND JASON COUNTY OKAY BUT NOT IN THE REST OF THE COUNTY. LOOK REALLY WHAT'S MISTER THERE WITH ME ARGUED HERE IS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE DISTRICTS AUTHORIZE THE ENTIRE COUNTY. NOT COUNTY'S AUTHORIZED THE ENTIRE COUNTY. THAT'S THAT'S WHERE THIS WILL ALSO GUIDE ANYTHING AND I GET THAT WHY THE ARGUMENT THAT. THERE SHOULD BE AN APPLICATION FOR COUNTY BENEFIT I GET THAT I'M GONNA ASK A DIFFERENT QUESTION THE LAST TO THE AUTHOR TO EVER YOU WANT TO ANSWER IT. I'M LOOKING JUST AT THE BILL LANGUAGE NOW I READ THE ANALYSIS. I LISTENED I THOUGHT I KNEW WHAT IT WAS. THAT I MIGHT BE THERE AND THEN I THOUGHT I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE I'M LOOKING AT THE BILL LANGUAGE AND I HEAR. WHAT I SEE IN THE BILL LANGUAGE IS DIFFERENT WHEN I HEARD WHAT I HEARD TODAY CONSISTENTLY WAS THE ABILITY TO OPEN A RESOURCE CENTER IN A WAY THAT'S MORE CONVENIENTLY LOCATED FOR STUDENTS BILL TO GET TO ACCESS? SEEMS REASONABLE WHEN I READ THE BILL LANGUAGE ALL I SEE. IS THAT. AN EXEMPTION TO ALLOW. EXEMPTION FROM GEOGRAPHICAL RESTRICTIONS THAT'S ALL I SEEN THE BILL LANGUAGE AND SO I DON'T SEE WHERE THE BILL LANGUAGE MATCHES UP. WITH THE THEMES THAT WE HURT DAY. WELL I MEAN I I ALREADY ANSWERED THAT MISTER THURMOND IN THAT THERE'S. YA SEPARATE SECTION OF THE CODE THAT RESTRICTS. ENROLLMENT AND SO. THE. YOU KNOW. HAS IT IN THEORY YOU COULD THAT HAVE A SATELLITE. RESOURCE CENTER. pPART OF THE STATE BUT. THE STUDENTS THERE WOULDN'T WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO ENROLL IN THE SCHOOL SO IT WOULD MAKE ANY SENSE AND YOU WOULDN'T SEE THAT. ONCE AGAIN I'M PUTTING IT ON THE RECORD THAT. THE THING THAT YOU SAID SOUNDS REASONABLE IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. THERE'S NOT SOME SINISTER SCHEME. REMOVE RESTRICTIONS AND HAVE THE WHOLE STATE BECOME VIRTUAL SCHOOLS NOT WHAT'S GOING ON IN FACT THE RESULT OF REJECTING THIS BILL IS GOING TO BE THESE BLENDED SCHOOLS HAVING TO BECOME MORE VIRTUAL BECAUSE REMOVING. THE ABILITY OF STUDENTS TO ACCESS THE PHYSICAL SITE WHERE THEY DO THINGS LIKE HAVE DIRECT INTERACTION WITH TEACHERS GET ACCESS TO SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES. PREMIERS HAVE A QUITE PLACE TO DO HOMEWORK. I DON'T WANT I DON'T WANT STUDENTS AND FAMILIES TO GET LAST. OR MORE DISTANCE FROM THOSE WHO SEEK TO HELP THEM. BUT AS I READ THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL GRACE IS A HUGE CONCERN FOR ME. AND THAT IT SEEMS TO SUGGEST MANY CREATES AWAY TO CREATE MORE DISTANCE BETWEEN. SCHOOLS. VIRTUAL SCHOOLS BLENDED SCHOOLS. IT ACTUALLY DOES WHAT YOU SIX DON'T WANT TO TO CREATE DISTANCE FROM WHERE STUDENTS WILL BE BECAUSE IT'S NOT BRICK AND MORTAR AND THAT CREATES. AN EXEMPTION WOULD THERE'S NO GEOGRAPHIC BOUNDARY AND IT CREATES DISTANCE BETWEEN. THE AUTHORIZED IT WHICH COULD ALSO BE A SUPPORTER. TO THAT SCHOOL. DUNST LOOKING AT THE BILL LANGUAGE AND IT SUGGESTS CREATING MORE DISTANCE STUDENTS WILL BE DESK DEPRIVE THEM WHERE THEY GET HELP. INCLUDING FROM THE AUTHORIZED AND THAT'S THAT'S WAS FOR. THAT'S WHERE I'M HAVING TROUBLE RIGHT. YOUR CALL US RESPOND QUIT OUT IS THAT IT IT'S IT'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE. IF YOU HAVE A STUDENT WHO'S IN THAT MIDDLE AREA OF THE GREY THERE THAT'S GOING TO A RESOURCE CENTER THAT'S IN THAT AREA THAT'S CLOSE TO THEIR HOME. WITHOUT TODAY'S BILL THAT CENTER IS GONNA HAVE TO CLOSE DOWN IF THEY DON'T WORK OUT AYE SOME OTHER ARRANGEMENT CAN BE VERY CHALLENGING AND OFTEN DRIVE FURTHER MAYBE TO ONE OF THE ORANGE AREAS OR TO THAT TO THE READ THAT'S ACTUALLY FARTHER FROM THEIR HOME AND THAT'S JUST THE. TRUTH AND IF YOU YOU KNOW IF YOU WANNA. SAY YOU THINK OTHERWISE THAT'S FINE BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IS HAPPENING. WOULD YOU SHOW ME WHERE THE LANGUAGES IN THE BILL. THAT SAYS THIS ALLOWS US TO CREATE RESOURCE CENTERS CLOSER FOR STUDENTS I'M JUST QUOTING THE LANGUAGE. THAT SAYS. GIVE AN EXEMPTION FOR ANY GEOGRAPHICAL RESTRICTIONS. AND I DON'T SEE ANYTHING THAT SUGGESTS. CREATES. RESOURCE CENTER AND MORE PROXIMITY. TO WHERE STUDENTS CAN BE HELPED. I WANT TO BE HELPFUL I JUST DON'T SEE IT IN THE LANGUAGE AND I'M ASKING IF YOU CAN POINT OUT TO ME. ARCHER WERE BOUGHT OUT BY THE LANGUAGE WE'VE BEEN REFERRING TO THAT'S FOUR SEVEN SIX. OH FIVE. AND OUT ALLOW WHY. MY WITNESS TO READ IT YET. IF YOU HAVE A QUICK RESPONSE OTHERWISE GONNA MOVE YOUR MISTER STEINORTH QUICK RESPONSE WAS THAT IT THAT EDUCATION CODE FOURSOME SIX OH FIVE AND FOUR SEVEN SIX FIVE POINT SAY. THAT A CHARTER SCHOOL MUST LOCATE WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF ITS AUTHORIZING. SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THAT THERE ARE A FEW EXCEPTIONS THAT ARE ALLOWED TO THAT ONE EXCEPTION IS. THAT A CHARTER SCHOOL MAY LOCATE ONE SIDE WEEKLY LIVE IS A DISTRICT BOUNDARIES BUT WITHIN THE AUTHOR WITHIN THE AUTHORIZING COUNTY UNDER A COUPLE CONDITIONS. THE OTHER EXCEPTION IS THAT A CHARTER SCHOOL MAY ESTABLISH A RESOURCE CENTER MEETING SPACE OR SATELLITE FACILITY IN AN ADJACENT COUNTY UNDER A COUPLE CONDITIONS. WE'RE SIMPLY SAYING WE'D LIKE. ANOTHER EXEMPTION. FROM THAT. DISTRICT BOUNDARIES ARE QUICKLY SHOWN. FOR NON CLASHING BASS CHARTERS THAT ARE PROVIDING THE STATE MANDATED SERVICES THROUGH RESOURCE CENTERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY IN WHICH IT'S AUTHORIZED PALESTINIAN TELL WOULD YOU WORD IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT WRITTEN HERE. HOW WOULD YOU WORD THAT EXCITES BUT THE PROBLEM HERE IS THE BILL'S VERY PLAYER THE WORD NOT WITHSTANDING? ANY OTHER LAW A CHARTER SCHOOL WHICH ALL PUPILS ATTEND THE CHARTER SCHOOL. THROUGH NON CLASSROOM BASED INSTRUCTION SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE GEOGRAPHICAL RESTRICTIONS AND THAT'S IT IT'S IN THE BILL MISTER STEINORTH. WELL I JUST WANTED TO SAY I'M THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DEBATE A LOT OF DISCUSSION I UNDERSTAND AND I TRUST MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER KILEY AT HIS WORD. THAT HE'S GOING TO WORK WITH EACH AND EVERYONE OF US. TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INTENT OF WHAT THE MAP AND WHAT HIS STATEMENTS ARE WILL MATCH LANGUAGE THAT WE WILL HAVE A CHANCE I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THIS BILL SO WE CAN CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ACHIEVE THE OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE ALL. LOOKING FOR. ALL SECOND. OKAY. YOU MAY CLOSE THE MOTION IS. WELL IN A MOMENT TO PASS. YOU MAY CLOSE DISCO. THANK YOU ALL FOR THE. SPIRITED CONVERSATION. AYE YEAH YOU KNOW IT'S FUNNY THE ARGUMENTS WE'VE HEARD HERE ARE ALL IN THE CAN JUMP YOU.

FREE ANDERSON STATUS QUO BUT WE'RE DOING LESS THAN THAT BECAUSE OR SIMPLY GRANDFATHERING IN THOSE FACILITIES THAT ARE EXISTING NOW. WE HAVE SOME DEBATE HERE OVER THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE TO COMMITTEE BROUGHT THIS TO OUR ATTENTION WE OFFERED TO AMEND IT TO THEIR SATISFACTION. AND THAT OFFER IS STILL ON THE TABLE. SO. I ASKED YOU TAKE ME AT MY WORD ON THAT AND THAT YOU GIVE ALL THESE FACILITIES THAT SERVE SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE KIDS.
