DO NOT YET HAVE A QUORUM. BUT WE WILL START AS A SUB COMMITTEE AND WE'LL START WITH SENATOR HELL. WHO HAS TWO BILLS BEFORE US SB TWO TWENTY TWO AND SB THREE TWENTY SIX HAVE A PREFERENCE I WOULD IF WE COULD START WITH SB THREE TWENTY SIX THE WITNESS IS STUCK IN SECURITY? OKAY -- SB THREE TWENTY SIX THEN BUT OUR OUR ITEM NUMBER FIVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND A GOOD MORNING. LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ON PAGE TEN OF THE ANALYSIS THANK YOU WHICH WHICH CLARIFIES THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN IMPOSE REQUIREMENTS GREATER THAN THOSE IN THE MEASURE. SB THREE TWENTY SIX BUILDS UPON LAST YEAR'S SB SEVEN TWENTY ONE WHICH I AUTHORED TO ADDRESS BALCONY INSPECTIONS AND REPAIRS FOR APARTMENT BUILDINGS FOLLOWING THE DEADLY TWENTY FIFTEEN BERKELEY BALCONY COLLAPSE. THAT KILLED SIX AND INJURED SEVEN SB THREE TWENTY SIX REQUIRES THAT EXISTING CONDOMINIUM BUILDINGS GOVERNED BY HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS HAVE INSPECTIONS AT LEAST ONCE EVERY NINE YEARS ON A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THEIR BALCONIES. STAIR WELLS AND OTHER EXTERIOR ELEVATED ELEMENTS TO ENSURE THEY ARE SAFE. SB THREE TWENTY SIX ALSO PREVENTS BUILDERS FROM PLACING LANGUAGE IN AN H. ALWAYS COVENANTS CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS ARE CCAR'S. THAT WOULD LIMIT THE ABILITY OF THE H. AWAY BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO SUE THE DEVELOPER IF THERE ARE CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS THIS IS NOT A HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION COLLEAGUES. A CASE IS CURRENTLY BEING LITIGATED IN SAN FRANCISCO WHERE A REACH A ROUTINE WATER LEAK REVEALED THAT A MAIN WALKWAY ON THE THIRD FLOOR WAS ABOUT TO COLLAPSE DUE TO WOULD DRIVE. WITH THE H. AWAY BOARD ATTEMPTED TO FILE A CIVIL SUIT AGAINST THE DEVELOPER. THEY FOUND REQUIREMENTS IN THEIR CCAR'S PLACED THERE BY THE DEVELOPER. THAT REQUIRED A FULL MEMBER VOTE BEFORE THEY COULD LEGALLY SEEK DAMAGES A TOOK THE BOARD MONTHS TO CONDUCT THE MEMBER VOTE. AND THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON CONSTRUCTION THAT DEFECT LAWSUIT NEARLY RAN OUT. THIS MEASURE HAS A BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND I DO HAVE WITNESSES MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. YOUR CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LOUIS BROWN ON BEHALF THE COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION'S INSTITUTE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE ACTION COMMITTEE. HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL -- LAST YEAR WE OPPOSED SB -- SEVEN TWENTY ONE WE DID NOT FEEL THAT THE MEASURES -- THE WORDS WITHIN IT FITS WITH COMMUNITY ASSOCIATIONS AND THE GOVERNING STRUCTURE AND HOW WE MANAGE OUR OUR BUILDINGS ARE INFRASTRUCTURE MAINTENANCE REPAIRS AND NGUYEN SENATOR HILL AGREED TO TAKE OUT THE LANGUAGE OF COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENT WE AGREED TO WORK WITH HIM ON A REASONABLE APPROACH THAT FIT THE GOVERNANCE. STRUCTURE OF COMMUNITY ASSOCIATIONS AND WE'RE HERE TODAY TO SAY THAT SB THREE TWENTY SIX ACCOMPLISHES THAT -- AND WE ARE PROUD TO BE A SUPPORTER AND SPONSOR OF THE BILL A WE BELIEVE THAT IT PROVIDES REASONABLE TIME LINES -- THAT WORK WITHIN AN ASSOCIATION TO PRESERVE STUDY -- AND THAT THE REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE SCHEDULES THAT WILL ALLOW FOR COMMUNITY ASSOCIATIONS AROUND THE STATE TO BUDGET APPROPRIATELY. AND THEN MANAGED THE SITUATIONS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH AGING INFRASTRUCTURE SPECIFICALLY BALCONY INTO AN ELEVATOR STRUCTURES AND SO WITH THAT WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE TODAY. THANK YOU THAT'S WITH US PLEASE MORNING GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS MARK CONTRARY IN IN THE THIRTY FIVE YEARS THAT I'VE. PRACTICE LONG CALIFORNIA REPRESENTED BOTH PLAINTIFFS AND DEFENDANTS. IN CONSTRUCTION DEFECT LITIGATION THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS A PRACTITIONER I FEEL THIS LEGISLATION IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR TWO BASIC REASONS. FIRST THAT PROTECTS HOME BUYERS FROM DANGEROUS AND LATENT -- HIDDEN CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS IN ELEVATED STRUCTURES. IT ALSO PROMOTES COMPLIANCE WITH THE PRE LITIGATION DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES THAT ALREADY EXIST. UNDER CIVIL CODE SECTION EIGHT NINE FIVE ALSO KNOWN AS TITLE. SEVEN FOR THE RIGHT TO REPAIR LOFT WE GENERICALLY REFER TO IT AS SB EIGHT HUNDRED FORMERLY SENATE BILL. EIGHT HUNDRED A REGULAR AND PERIODIC INSPECTIONS OF ELEVATED STRUCTURES BY PROPERLY LICENSED AND TRAINED EXPERTS IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. BECAUSE THESE CONDITIONS ARE NOT APPARENT TO HOMEOWNERS. WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR OR WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT? WE'VE HANDLED MANY CASES OVER THE YEARS WHERE ELEVATED DACHSHUND BALCONIES. HAVE BEEN DANGEROUSLY DEFECTIVE BUT WE'RE NOT DISCOVERED. UNTIL THE RIGHT TYPE OF EXPERTS WERE ONSITE CONDUCTING THE RIGHT TYPE OF INVESTIGATION. SO WE APPRECIATE CENTER HILLS EFFORTS ON THIS IMPORTANT SAFETY ISSUE AND ENERGY OR SUPPORT FOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR NELSON SUPPORTS -- SING NONE AS THEIR OPPOSITION. BY SINGER BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR FOR AN AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIMES THANK YOU THANK YOU WE WILL TAKE THAT UP ONCE WE DO HAVE A QUORUM. THANK YOU THEN I TO OUR ITEM NUMBER THREE SB TWO TWENTY TWO THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATED MISTER CHAIR. UP FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR THE WORK ON THIS BILL. SB TWO TWENTY TWO IS A REINTRODUCTION OF ITS ME FOURTEEN TWENTY SEVEN FROM LAST YEAR. WHICH SHIP PASSED THIS COMMITTEE AND FULL LEGISLATURE WITH BROAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT SB TWO TWENTY TWO WOULD PROTECT VETERANS. AND MILITARY PERSONNEL FROM HOUSING DISCRIMINATION AND ENSURE THAT LANDLORDS CANNOT DENY HOMELESS VETERANS HOUSING BASED SOLELY ON THE FACT THAT THEY RECEIVE A RENTAL ASSISTANCE VOUCHERS. US VETERANS IN THOSE CURRENTLY SERVING IN THE ARMED FORCES ARE PROTECTED FROM EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION BY THE CALIFORNIA FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT. HOWEVER THE LAW DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE VETERANS OR MILITARY PERSONNEL AMONG THOSE WHO ARE PROTECTED FROM HOUSING DISCRIMINATION. ALMOST EVERY OTHER PROTECTED CLASS IN THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT IS PROTECTED IN BOTH EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING DISCRIMINATION. SB TWO TWENTY TWO WOULD ADDRESS THIS GAP BY ADDING VETERANS AND MILITARY PERSONNEL AS A PROTECTED CLASS IN STATUTES RELATING TO HOUSING DISCRIMINATION. THE BILL WILL ALSO ENSURE OUR HEROES ARE NOT DISCRIMINATED AGAINST IN HOUSING AND ARE NOT TONIGHT HOUSING BECAUSE OF HOW THEY PAY THEIR RENT. LAST YEAR WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA OF THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION TO REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION. THESE ORGANIZATIONS REMAIN NEUTRAL ON THIS YEAR'S VERSION OF THE BILL. OUR VETERANS AND MILITARY PERSONNEL ALREADY FACE SIGNIFICANT HOUSING CHALLENGES THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST WHEN TRYING TO FIND A HOME FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. I DO HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU THANK YOU FIRST WITH THIS PLACE YEAH -- GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS GREG HAYES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF VETERANS SERVICE AGENCIES IT'S A CONSORTIUM OF SEVEN NON PROFITS AROUND CALIFORNIA THAT SERVE VETERANS -- WE WE CONSIDER GREATEST NEED AROUND THE AREAS OF HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING AND MENTAL HEALTH. AND THIS BILL'S PRETTY CRITICAL WE HAVE HAD ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE -- FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS WE ARE CASE WORKERS HAVE ENCOUNTERED THIS WITH VETERANS WE HAVE AS WE ALL KNOW ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING. MARKETS RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF FINDING HOUSING. LANDLORDS ARE TURNING AWAY VETERANS WITH HAD VAST VOUCHERS FREQUENTLY AND I JUST TO UNDERSCORE THE ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE THAT WE'VE SEEN IN MARCH. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE OUT WASHINGTON ATTORNEY STATE WASHINGTON ATTORNEY GENERAL I DID -- A BIT OF STAYING ON THIS PARTICULAR CHALLENGING PROBLEM SAID A EMAIL TO FIFTY RANDOM LANDLORDS IN WASHINGTON -- ASKING IF THEY WOULD ACCEPT THE HIDE BASH VOUCHER FOR HOUSING TEN JUST SENT BLANKET RESPONSES OF NOW. HI AND THEY WERE VARYING LEVELS OF CHALLENGES BEYOND THAT FOR THE REMAINING FORTY AND THE BUT URBAN INSTITUTE STUDY. ALSO LAST YEAR I FOUND THAT IN LOS ANGELES 76% OF LANDLORDS WERE TURNING DOWN -- VOUCHERS FOR HOUSING SO THE WE CONSIDER THIS A PRETTY ACUTE PROBLEM HI FOR THOSE WE SERVE AND WE GREATLY APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT IN THIS BILL. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SEEING NONE BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMON THREATS. THANK YOU SENATOR. WE HAD A VERY ROBUST DISCUSSION LAST WEEK ON A RELATED ISSUE BUT TO EXTENDED NOW IS A PROTECTED CLASS. I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR DOING THIS I THINK HOMELESSNESS AMONG OUR VETERANS IS A BIG ISSUE. AND I LIKE THE ANECDOTAL INFORMATION THAT WAS PROVIDED. HI IN SAN BERNADINO I WANT TO SHARE THAT WE HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB OF PROVIDING HOUSING FOR OUR VETERANS. BUT THE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST OUR VETERANS WITH VOUCHERS IS CLEAR THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL. THANK YOU. SPEECH NORRIS. GOOD MORNING AT SENATOR AS YOU NOTED THIS IS A RE INTRODUCTION OF A BILL THAT WAS VETOED LAST YEAR. BY GOVERNOR BROWN AB. BECAUSE HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THE CONCERNS THAT HE REYES WHAT A MESSAGE THE GOVERNOR WAS CONCERNED IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY AND I DON'T REMEMBER WHETHER HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT WANT WHICH PART IT WAS -- I THINK HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE ISSUE OF OF THE PROTECTED CLASS THAT WOULD BE CREATED FOR THIS FOR HOUSING AND I THINK THAT -- AS WE KNOW AND IT'S JUST BEEN ARTICULATED VETERANS SHOULD BE PROTECTED IN HOUSING DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE WE SEE EVIDENCE OF THAT AND IT SHOULD JUST A BASIC PHILOSOPHICAL DISAGREEMENT I THINK WE HAVE WITH THE GOVERNOR. RIGHT AND I THINK THEY ARE THE OTHER CONCERN THAT HE REYES WAS THAT THIS WAY TO COMPILE. PROPERTY OWNERS TO PARTICIPATE IN A PROGRAM THAT ENCOUNTERING CUMBERSOME SO. AND IN THE HOW TO PROGRAM THAT WE SEE IN THE TO PUT IT INTO CONTEXT. IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE A TOTAL OF EIGHTEEN HUNDRED BASH BATCH. IN THE ENTIRE STATE WITH SIX SIX MILLION RENTAL UNITS. THE IMPACT THAT WOULD HAVE IS MINIMAL THE BENEFIT IS EXTRAORDINARY. AND I THINK THAT WHEN YOU PUT IT IN CONTEXT AND PERSPECTIVE WE CAN SEE THAT IT'S A IT'S A MINOR. PERHAPS INCONVENIENCE AS SOMEONE WHO HAS RENTAL PROPERTY. AND WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO GO THROUGH WHATEVER IS NECESSARY AND AND FROM WHAT WE'VE SEEN IT'S IT'S SPECIFIC TO WHATEVER HOUSING AUTHORITY IN THE COUNTY THAT IN WHICH THE PROPERTIES LOCATED. UP AND MANY HAVE MADE IN STREAMLINED THE PROCESS TO THAT THEY CAN GET THROUGH IT EXPEDITIOUSLY AND IT'S NOT A BURDEN ON THE LANDLORDS THAT CORRECT. YES OF COURSE. I I'M IF I IF I MAY I JUST WANT TO MENTION TWO THINGS ONE IF YOU ARE A VETERAN RECEIVING A HIDE BASH VOUCHER. YOU ARE ALSO RECEIVING OTHER SUPPORTIVE SERVICES SO IF YOU'RE A TENANT TO ME IT'S AN ENVIABLE SITUATION BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT OF SERVICES IN ORDER TO MAKE THEIR LIVES COMPLETE. AND 25% OF ALL VETERANS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS PRESIDING CALIFORNIA IN THE UNITED STATES -- SO PRETTY INTENSE PROBLEM HERE. AND WITH THE SMALL NUMBER OF ABOUT VOUCHERS THAT WE HAVE. YEAH NO I WOULD CERTAINLY AGREE WITH YOU VETERANS HOMELESSNESS IS. YEAH I THINK IT'S SHAMEFUL THAT FOR FOLKS THAT HAVE SERVED OUR COUNTRY. EN SACRIFICING MUCH THAT THEY WOULD BE WITHOUT. A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD NURSE YES MA'AM THAT WE CAN CAN DO -- SO AGREE WITH YOU THAT IT IS AN ACUTE AN IMPORTANT. SHE PRESSED ITSELF. THANK. RIGHT CENTER YOU MAY CLOSE IT RESPECTFULLY ASK RELIABILITY APPROPRIATE TIME MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE DISCUSSION AND AND CONVERSATION CREATING HELP THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR. ALRIGHT SENATOR JACKSON OUR ITEM TO SB ONE SEVENTY ONE THE SYSTEM RAMOS FAVOR [inaudible] PAY DATA. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS GOOD MORNING. THIS IS A SB. ONE THOSE ITEMS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS. WHICH MAY CLARIFYING AND TECHNICAL CHANGES REGARDING WHAT IS INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. AND SPECIFIED THAT A REPORT OF AGGREGATE DATA BY IDEA PH MAY BE PUBLISHED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT AS A SHELL. BUT I FEAR THE COST IS GOING TO UNDERMINE THE INTENT OF THE BILL SO. MAY. SEEM TO BE THAT POINT -- THAT WOULD JOB -- BE AVAILABLE AND AND WORTH -- WORKABLE FOR EVERYONE. THIS IS A BILL TO FIGHT PAY DISCRIMINATION WITH DATA WITH INFORMATION BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO PAY EQUITY FOR WOMEN AND MINORITIES. YOU CAN'T FIX WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW. AND WE CAN TALK ANECDOTALLY WE CAN MAKE ASSUMPTIONS BASED UPON OUR OWN LIFE EXPERIENCE BUT NOTHING SUBSTITUTES FOR GOOD HARD DATA. AND THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE THAT EMPLOYERS WITH A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES ARE MORE -- WILL BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A DAY -- PAY DATA REPORT ANNUALLY TO DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING OUTLINING THE COMPENSATION IN HOURS WORKED OF EMPLOYEES BY GENDER. RACE ETHNICITY AND JOB CATEGORY THE GOAL IS TWO FOLD. FIRST TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYERS TO ANALYZE THEIR OWN PAY PRACTICES AND ALLOW FOR SELF CORRECTION. I DO NOT THINK OR BELIEVE THAT MOST EMPLOYERS INTENTIONALLY DISCRIMINATE I THINK THEY DO SO THROUGH EITHER IMPLICIT BIAS OR UNCONSCIOUS DECISION MAKING. AND I THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUT A MIRROR IN FRONT OF THEIR THESE COMPANIES SO THAT THEY CAN SELF EVALUATE AND REALIZE THAT IN MANY INSTANCES. THEY ARE INDEED DISCRIMINATING NOT NECESSARILY INTENTIONALLY SO THIS IS SORT OF A SOFT TOUCH TO ALLOW FOR ITSELF CORRECTION. THE SECOND ASPECT TO THIS. BILLS GOAL IS TO ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING TO GATHER IMPORTANT DATA THAT ALLOWS THEM TO SEE PATTERNS OF WAGE DISPARITIES. IN IF THEY NOTICE DEVIATIONS WORE OUT LIARS TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER SO PERHAPS THIS DISCRIMINATION IS INTENTIONAL OR THAT NOTHING IS BEING DONE TO AMELIORATE IT TO TO CORRECT IT BECAUSE WE KNOW WHEN YOU ADD WOMEN AND PEOPLE. OF COLOR AND ALL THE COMMUNITIES THAT MAKE UP CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES DO BETTER. AND TO THIS WILL IT THIS INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE ALSO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT IF THEY REQUESTED. THIS BILL IS CLOSELY MODELED AFTER EFFORTS THAT WERE DONE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. RECOGNIZING THAT ON EQUAL PAY IS FREQUENTLY HIDDEN FROM VIEW. TO BOTH EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEES THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED A PROPOSED REVISION TO THE DEMOGRAPHIC REPORT THAT LARGE EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTING FOR MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS. THIS IS THE EMAIL ONE THE EMPLOYER INFORMATION REPORT. THAT HAS BEEN. A REQUIRED ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL FOR AGAIN -- HALF A CENTURY THE BILL THAT THIS BILL THEN WILL IT EXPANDED TO INCLUDE THE REPORTING A PAY DATA. BY RACE GENDER BEGINNING IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUY PIGGY BACKING ON AN EXISTING LONG STANDING DATA COLLECTION REPORT THE IDEA WAS THAT THIS DATA COULD BE COLLECTED WITH MINIMAL DISRUPTION TO EMPLOYERS. BUT IN AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTEEN PREDICTABLY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SAID EQUAL PAY EFFORTS BACK BY PUTTING A WHOLE TO THIS NEW RULE. THE NATIONAL WOMEN'S LAW CENTER SUIT. ARGUING THAT THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT BUDGET LACK GOOD CARS TO STAY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PAY DATA COLLECTION. IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR A FEDERAL JUDGE ORDERED THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO MOVE FORWARD. WITH COLLECTING THIS IMPORTANT DATA CITING THE EXTENSIVE PREPARATION STE SAUDI AN INPUT THAT WENT INTO THE CREATION OF THIS DATA REVISION. AND DECLARING THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET'S DECISION TO HALT THE PROGRAM TO BE ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS. IT'S POSSIBLE THIS DECISION COULD BE APPEALED AND THIS BILL ENSURES THAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. THIS DATA WILL BE COLLECTED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THEY CREATED A VERY VIABLE TEMPLATE HOPEFULLY WILL CONTINUE THEIR BUT REGARDLESS WE WANTED TO CONTINUE HERE. IT'S OF RIGHT NOW THE COLLECTION OF THIS PAY DATA REQUESTED UNDER THIS BILL IS IN FACT UNDER WAY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AND THIS MEASURE AGAIN INSURERS THE DATA WILL BE IN THE HANDS OF OUR STATE AGENCIES AS WELL. AN EMPLOYER MAY COMPLY BY THE WAY WITH THIS BILL BY SIMPLY SUBMITTING A COPY OF THEIR E. O. ONE REPORT NOTHING COULD BE EASIER BUT THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT WAY. THAT WE ARE GOING TO ACHIEVE THAT GENDER EQUITY THAT EVEN OUR FRIENDS. IN THE BUSINESS WORLD SUPPORTED WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE FAIR PAY ACT I IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND IF WE WANT TO IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT ACHIEVING THAT GOAL THIS IS ONE OF THE TOOLS IN THAT TO BOX. AND JOB I'D I BELIEVE IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. THAT WE MOVE FORWARD WITH IT AND ALL DEAL WITH SOME OF THE POTENTIAL ISSUES NOW THAT. SEEMS AT THE THE COMMITTEE IS. COMING. TO A QUORUM AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AS WE PROCEED WITH THAT I HAVE A TWO WITNESSES WITH ME JESSICA STANDARD OF THE EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES. AND SHANNON SMITH CRAWLEY WITH A A YOU W. TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU FIRST WITH PLEASE GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JESSICA CENTER ON BEHALF OF EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES PRACTICAL SPONSOR THIS MEASURE. I'M GONNA FOCUS MY TESTIMONY BRIEFLY ON WHY THE BILL WILL HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO THE GENDER AND RACIAL WAGE GAP THAT PERSISTS IN THIS STATE AND IN THIS COUNTRY. I ALSO WANTED DOES KNOW THE EOC REALLY TOOK A A MULTI YEAR THOROUGH AND COMPREHENSIVE PROCESS TO IDENTIFY THE BEST WAY TO COLLECT THIS DATA. THE MOST EFFECTIVE DATA TO COLLECT AND LEAST BURDENSOME WAY TO COLLECTED ON EMPLOYERS SO THAT WHOLE KIND OF PROCESS THAT THEY UNDERTOOK IS REALLY WHAT THIS AND AND AND RESULTED IN THEIR PAY DATA COLLECTION FORM AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. IS WHAT THIS BILL IS BASED ON REALLY GOOD INVESTIGATION AND AND AND ANALYSIS -- AS CENTER JACKSON MENTIONED THE REAL KEY IMPORTANCE OF HIS BILL IS THAT WHILE WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT EQUAL PAY AS A MATTER OF IT WOMAN A VERSUS WOMAN BE -- MAN BE PERFORMING SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR WORK AND WHETHER THEY'RE BEING PAID EQUALLY FOR THAT SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR WORK ANOTHER REALLY PERVASIVE PROBLEM THAT CONTRIBUTES TO THE OVERALL GENERATIONAL WAGE GAP. IS OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION WHICH IS A VERY ENTRENCHED PHENOMENON WHEREBY WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR OFTEN FOCUSED IN ARE CONCENTRATED IN LOWER PAID POSITIONS WITHIN A COMPANY OR EVEN WITHIN INDUSTRIES. AND AS CENTER JACKSON ALLUDED TO A LOT OF TIMES THOSE TRENDS ARE KNOWN BY AN EMPLOYER AND SO THIS DATA COLLECTION WILL GIVE EMPLOYERS OPPORTUNITY TO IDENTIFY TRENDS WITHIN THEIR OWN COMPANY THAT THEY MAY NOT HAVE BEEN AWARE OF AND THEN POTENTIALLY. CHANGE THEIR PRACTICES REGARDING HIRING PROMOTION -- AND PAY PRACTICES TO BETTER TO BETTER REPRESENT PEOPLE AT ALL LEVELS OF WAGES A COULD POTENTIALLY ALSO IDENTIFY PAY DISPARITIES ARE UNLAWFUL PROMPTING THEM TO CLOSE THOSE GAPS -- I WANT ALSO NOTE THAT BIG BUSINESSES THEMSELVES OF RECOGNIZE THE UTILITY OF THIS KIND OF PAY DATA ANALYSIS WITHIN THEIR COMPANIES MANY BUSINESSES A PUBLICLY DONE THAT SALES FORCE GAP STARBUCKS ARE A FEW. WHO FOUND THAT THESE PAY A DATE AUDITS DO REVEAL DISPARITIES AND ONE FOUND TO BE UNJUSTIFIED THEY THEN CAN RECTIFY THEIR PAY SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE PAID FAIRLY AND FAIRLY DISTRIBUTED WITHIN THE PAY SCALES OF THEIR COMPANY -- FINALLY ALL KNOW THAT THEIR TEEN COMPANIES AND NOW UP TO TWENTY SEVEN THIRTEEN IN APRIL NOW TWENTY SEVEN TOOK THE FAIR PAY PLEDGING CALIFORNIA PLEDGING TO DO THIS TYPE OF AUDIT. SO WE SEE THAT BUSINESSES RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE AND UTILITY OF THIS KIND OF PAID IT AUDIT WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA DO TAKE THE STEPS. TO BETTER CLOSE THE GENDER AND RACIAL WAGE GAP AND AS SENATOR JACKSON NOTED IF THE FIT FIT FEDERAL RULE REMAINS IN PLACE BUSINESSES WILL BE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH THIS LAW -- BY SUBMITTING THAT DATA THAT THEY'VE ALREADY SUBMITTED THE FEDERAL LEVEL. I WITH THAT WOULD REQUEST RIVAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA PAUSE TESTIMONY ENDS TECH PRO PLEASE STONE HERE GALLAGHER CHAO. CHIU GONZALEZ. HOLDEN KALRA. KILEY. IN CHINA. OBERNOLTE [inaudible] NORRIS [inaudible] REYES. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A QUORUM. NEXT WITNESS. WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THANK YOU THAT'S WITH US PLEASE HI THIS IS SHANNON SMITH CURRENTLY REPRESENTING AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY WOMEN ALL TAKE THE HINT ON THE MOTIONS -- JUST ONE OF THERE'S SOME REAL CRITICAL DATA. WE DID A LOT OF WORK SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE STATE SOME REALLY GREAT BILLS. BUT THERE'S A LAG IN IN THAT -- THOSE CHANGES SHOWING UP IN LAW. AND SHOWING IT BUT THEN STATISTICS AND NOW. WE HAVE ARE WAITING. IF WE KEEP WITH THE STATUS QUO WITHOUT ANY NEW INFORMATION. WE WILL CLOSE THE GENDER WAGE GAP WAGE GAP IN A HUNDRED AND ONE YEARS. WE DON'T THINK THAT'S ACCEPTABLE -- THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. IS SENATOR JACKSON'S AND PROBABLY MOST EMPLOYERS DON'T WAKE UP IN THE MORNING. AND SAY THEY'RE GOING TO OVERTLY DISCRIMINATE ONLY THE DATA SHOW ABOUT 6212% OF THE UP PAYING DISPARITY IS JUDY OUT RIGHT -- BIAS OR DISCRIMINATION THE REST OF IT IS JUST DOING BUSINESS AS USUAL. NOT LOOKING AT IT -- AGAIN THE THE FENCE WENT THROUGH AN EXHAUSTIVE PROCESS TO WEIGH THE BENEFIT IN THE BURDEN IT'S GOING TO BE AN ADDITIONAL OF FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN DOLLARS. LAWYER TO COLLECT THIS DATA. IS COLLECTED AT THE TIME OF EMPLOYMENT IN ITS MARRIED WITH THE W. TWO DATA. OF THE GOVERNMENT. DOES THIS OF WITH -- COLLECTING DATA THROUGH THE IO FOR FORM. SO ALSO. JUST TO CONSIDER THE CUTE THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT. OF THIS ON WOMEN'S. THE ABILITY TO CARE FOR THEMSELVES CARE FOR THEIR FAMILIES TO HAVE RETIREMENT INCOME. OF THIS. ESSENTIALLY IMPACTS SOCIAL.

GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE CHEN FLOOR ON BEHALF OF WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MITCH SNIDER WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE SCAN MINE FROM THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION PROUD CO SPONSOR AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. RENEE BAYARDO SO YOU CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION SORRY. YOUR BUT I GOOD MORNING MR WHERE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JENNIFER BROWN BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS PROPOSAL. THERE IS NO QUESTION OR DEBATE THAT WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF FAIR PAY FOR WOMEN WE SUPPORTED THE THAT LANDMARK LEGISLATION THAT SENATOR JACKSON -- DO SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHICH WAS UNPRECEDENTED I THINK FOR THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO COME OUT AND SUPPORT SUCH -- A PIECE OF LEGISLATION I ALSO PERSONALLY I PARTICIPATED IN THE TASK FORCE TO IMPLEMENT THAT LEGISLATION FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS -- THE TASK FORCE THAT WAS CREATED AS A PART OF THE COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE EMPLOYER COMMUNITY AND THE EMPLOYEE COMMUNITY BOTH UNDERSTOOD THE RESPONSIBILITIES OBLIGATIONS AND BENEFITS UNDER THE FAIR PAY ACT. AND OUR CONCERN OUR PRIMARY CONCERN WITH THIS PROPOSAL ON THE COLLECTION OF DATA IS THAT IT'S INCONSISTENT WITH WHAT IS BEING TOLD TO EMPLOYERS WITH REGARDS TO THE FAIR PAY ACT THE FAIR PAY ACT THAT FUNDAMENTAL. DISCUSSION ABOUT THE FAIR PAY ACT WAS THAT YOU SHOULD NOT COMPARE TO PEOPLE BASED UPON JOB TITLES OR THEIR THEIR POSITION THAT IT SHOULD BE COMPARATIVE BASED UPON THE ACTUAL DUTIES THAT THEY ARE PERFORMING. AND THIS DATA COLLECTION REQUIRES AN EMPLOYER TO COLLECT DATA AND REFER A REPORT DATA BASED UPON JOB TITLES ALONE. AND SO TO SUGGEST THAT THIS IS GOING TO SOMEHOW ILLUSTRATE A DISPARITY IN PAY UNDER OUR FAIR PAY ACT IS INCONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE COMMISSION HAS PUT OUT OR SKEWS ME THE TASK FORCE IS PUT OUT. WITH REGARDS -- TO IMPLEMENTING THE FAIR PAY ACT AND IT'S INCONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE LAW ACTUALLY REQUIRES FOR EMPLOYERS WITH REGARDS TO THE FERRET PACK TO COMPARE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR JOB POSITIONS ACCORDING TO DUTIES NOT ACCORDING TO TITLE -- WERE ALSO CONCERNED WITH REGARDS -- TO THE W. TO INFORMATION THAT'S COLLECTED THAT INFORMATION IS. IMPACTED BY PERSONAL DECISIONS OF THE EMPLOYEES THEMSELVES THE FAIR PACKED SAYS THAT IT'S THE RATE OF PAY THAT THE EMPLOYER PROVIDES THAT NEEDS TO BE THE DETERMINING FACTOR. W. TO EARNINGS CAN BE IMPACTED BY THE DIRECTIONS EXEMPTIONS PERSONAL CHOICES THAT AN EMPLOYEE MAKES AND AGAINST YOUR REPORTING THAT INFORMATION AND BASED UPON. JOB TITLES AND W. TO EARNINGS THERE MAY BE FALSE POSITIVES OF WAGE DISPARITY WERE WHAT NINE ACTUALLY EXISTS -- OUR OTHER CONCERN IS THAT IS APPLICABLE TO ANY EMPLOYER WITH A HUNDRED MORE EMPLOYEES BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S A HUNDRED MORE EMPLOYEES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WHETHER OR NOT THIS REPORT IS ONLY LIMITED TO THOSE EMPLOYEES HERE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE AS WE KNOW CALIFORNIA'S UNIQUE AND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY DOES NOT NECESSARILY HAVE THE SAME EQUAL PAY LAWS THAT CALIFORNIA DOES AND SO FOR COLLECTING DATA. ON EMPLOYEES AND OTHER STATES WHAT RELEVANCY IS THAT FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT I EMPLOYERSARE COMPLYING WITH CALIFORNIA'S EQUAL PAY LAW. ADDITIONALLY -- I'VE HEARD ALSO DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN JUST SUBMIT THE EO ONE FORM AND BE COMPLIANT WITH THE SLOT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE BILL SAYS IT SAYS IF IT'S SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR INFORMATION THEN YOU CAN COLLECT OUR ESTIMATE THE EO ONE FORM BE COMPLIANCE BUT OUR CONCERN IS. THE PERSPECTIVE OF WHETHER OR NOT THE EO ONE FORM AND THIS REPORT ARE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR MAY I BE IN THE AGENCIES PERSPECTIVE NOT THE SAME AND SO YOU ARE CREATING AN ADDITIONAL BURDEN ON EMPLOYERS TO SUBMIT A SEPARATE DATA REPORT. IF IT IS THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR WHICH WE HOPE IT IS THAT YOU CAN JUST SUBMIT THE EO ONE FOREMAN BEING COMPLIANCE AND WE WOULD HOPE THAT THE LEGISLATION IS AMENDED TO REFLECT THAT. AND FINALLY I'LL SAY THERE'S A LOT OF COMPANIES WHO HAVE DONE AMAZING THINGS SINCE THE FAIR PAY ACT WAS IMPLEMENTED THEY HAVE DONE INTERNAL AUDITS THEY HAVE DONE INTERNAL HE REPORTS TO MAKE SURE. THAT THEY ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH FAIR PAY ACT BUT AGAIN THOSE AUDITS ARE BASED UPON SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR DUTIES THEY'RE NOT BASED UPON JOB TITLES AND SO THOSE AUDITS ARE NOT THE SAME AS WHAT'S BEEN REQUESTED AS A PART OF THIS DATA REPORT. AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE CONCERNED WITH THE BURDEN THIS IS A PLACE IN ON THE EMPLOYER WHETHER OR NOT THE INFORMATION COLLECTED IN BEING SUBMITTED HIS EVEN RELEVANT FOR PURPOSES OF CALIFORNIA'S FAIR PAY ACT. AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED. MR MILLER JR MEMBERS CHRISTMAS KAYLEE ON BEHALF OF THE OF CALIFORNIA AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION COUNTY I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WITH SENATOR JACKSON AND OTHERS ON THE ON SB THREE FIFTY EIGHT AND THE SUBSTANTIAL AMENDMENTS WE MADE TO LABOR CODE SECTION LEVIN NINETY SEVEN POINT. FIVE AND I WOULD JUST HAD A COUPLE OF COMMENTS TO THOSE ALREADY ENUMERATED BY MYSTERY OR THE FIRST IS THAT I'M NOT SURE THAT THE EO ONE FORM IS THE PANACEA OF THAT. THE AUTHOR AND PROPONENTS VIEW IT AS A SPECIALLY IN THE AGGREGATE DATA WE WOULD IN FACT EXPECT. A FAIR AMOUNT OF PAY DISPARITY IF YOU WOULD. A CLEARLY WHAT IS IMPORTANT UNDER THE LAW AS WHETHER OR NOT IT'S A VIOLATION OF THE LAW. IS SB THREE FIFTY EIGHT ENUMERATED THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BONTA FIGHT FACTORS. A AS TO WHY PAY DISPARITY IS IN FACT LAWFUL SUCH AS EDUCATION TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE IN OTHER WORDS WE WOULD HOPE THAT. THE INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS BEEN EMPLOYED BY ABC COMPANY. FOR TEN YEARS AS PAID SUBSTANTIALLY MORE THAN THE INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS JUST RECENTLY HIRED IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS. THE SECOND POINT IS. MANY OF THESE BUSINESSES ARE ALREADY DOING THIS TYPE OF DATA NOT JUST THE THE PRE WORK BUT THIS WOULD BE THE THIRD TIME IN WHICH COMPANIES WOULD BE SUBMITTING THIS DATA SO I'M NOT SURE THAT THIS NOTION OF WHAT WE DON'T SEE WE DON'T KNOW COMMENT THAT'S BEEN MADE. OBVIOUSLY MANY OF THE COMPANIES PRIOR TO THE ENACTMENT OF SB THREE FIFTY EIGHT I'M ITS EFFECTIVE DATE -- ONE ONE TWENTY SIXTEEN WERE ALREADY DOING -- PAY DATA REPORTING AND ANALYSIS OF THEIR OWN COMPANIES AND THEIR PAY PRACTICES THAT'S WHY YOU SAW MANY OF THE MAJOR PAPERS FROM THE LA TIMES TO CHRONICLE AND SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS. NOTING MANY FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES AND SMALLER COMPANIES A CHANGING THEIR PAY PRACTICES TO BE IN COMPLIANCE PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE. OF THREE FIFTY EIGHT THE OTHER POINT IS I'M A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT -- THE ONE AUTHORS AMENDMENT ENUMERATE ON PAGE SEVEN AND I HAD JUST SEEN THIS THIS MORNING IN THE ANALYSIS. THAT ANY INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION SUBMITTED IS NOT SUBJECT TO A PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST -- WHEN THE THE AMENDMENTS WERE ORIGINALLY DONE LAST YEAR IN LAST YEAR'S VERSION OF THIS BILL? IT WAS TO ALL OF THE DATA BEING SUBMITTED EITHER IN THE EO ONE FORM OR WHAT THE BILL NOW SAYS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR -- WE ALSO HAVE OFFERED TO THE AUTHOR TO IMPORTANT AMENDMENTS ONE THE ITEM THAT WAS A NUMERATOR BY MYSTERY ARE ON THE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR WE WOULD. RATHER STRIKE THAT LANGUAGE AND SIMPLY SAY THE SUBMISSION OF THE EO ONE FORM -- INSURERS COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATUTE AND THEN THE SECOND ITEM IS LIKE THE FEDERAL LAW. THAT -- ANY DISCLOSURE OF THIS INFORMATION WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME MISDEMEANOR THOUSAND DOLLAR PENALTY AS FEDERAL LAW ENUMERATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. IF YOU COME FOR GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE. LOCAL RICE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WE ARE OPPOSED AND ALSO HAVE TALKED TO THE AUTHOR ABOUT THE SUBSTANTIAL SIMILAR. LANGUAGE IN THE BILL AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT REMOVED AS WELL THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MATTHEW ALL OF WESTERN GROWERS ARE SUPPOSED. GOOD MORNING KATIE AND SOME OF THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION WERE OPPOSED AS WELL. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. PRICING NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SINGER SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST THIS BILL ARE APPLES AND ORANGES. THIS ISN'T ASKING WHETHER THE FAIR PAY ACT IS BEING COMPLIED WITH. THIS IS LOOKING AT THE THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL ABOUT JOB SEGREGATION INTO IT DIFFERENT ISSUE. THIS IS WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE FINDING WOMEN AND MINORITIES CAST INTO THE LOWER PAYING JOB CATEGORIES. NOT WHETHER OR NOT INDIVIDUALS ARE BEING PAID THE SAME FOR THE SAME OR SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR WORK THIS IS LOOKING AT TRENDS THIS BILL. IS LOOKING TO IDENTIFY. OF FOR PRIMARILY FOR THE BENEFIT OF AN EMPLOYER WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE CASTING WOMEN AND MINORITIES IN THEIR LOWEST PAYING. JOB. AREAS AND IF SO THIS BILL SAYS FRANKLY THAT MAY BE A VIOLATION OF THE F. B. H. REQUIREMENTS AND LAW AND NOW IS IT IS. BUT THE GOAL IS TO GET THESE COMPANIES TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO START HIRING WOMEN IN HIGHER LEVEL POSITIONS BECAUSE WE ARE DISCRIMINATING BASED ON JOB CATEGORY. AND THIS IS A SOFT TOUCH I HAVE RECORDS ACT SOMETHING I WOULD NEVER. UP BECAUSE THE GOAL HERE IS TO LOOK IN THE AGGREGATE. WE ARE NOT LOOKING MICROSCOPICALLY COMPARING ONE SHOP AGAINST ANOTHER WHERE THE WHOLE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR ISSUE MIGHT COME IN WE ARE LOOKING AT JOB CATEGORIES. AND I I LOW FRUSTRATED BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY DIFFERENT TIMES I'VE HAD TO SAY THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE FAIR PAY ACT AND I WILL TELL YOU MISS PEREIRA HAS BEEN A ROCK STAR. ON THE FAIR PAY ACT BUT THAT THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT THE FAIR PAY ACT THIS IS ABOUT. THE DISCRIMINATION THE HISTORICAL DISCRIMINATION WHEN YOU HAVE TWO PEOPLE WHO ARE APPLYING FOR A JOB ONE OF THEM IS TO BE AN ADMINISTRATIVE VADER SECRETARY IT HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY FAR MORE LIKELY THAT THAT'S THE JOB THE WOMAN WILL GET. AND FREQUENTLY IMPORT EMPLOYERS DON'T THINK ABOUT IT THAT IS TRUST IN IMPLICIT BIAS THAT EXISTS EVEN IF THAT WOMAN MAY VERY WELL BE MORE QUALIFIED THAN THE MAN WHOSE PULL APPLYING FOR A POSITION. THAT WILL ALLOW -- FOR GREATER JOB GROWTH AND HIGHER OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THAT. JOB FRAMEWORK SO THIS BILL IS ABOUT JOB SEGREGATION THIS BILL. IS SOME -- DESIGNED TO USE THE E. L. ONE SO LONG AS IT IS IN PLACE AND I'M TOLD THAT IN FACT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVING NOTHING BETTER TO DO. HAS DECIDED TO APPEAL THE DECISION. ON THIS BILL ARE SO TO THE EXTENT THAT FOR SOME REASON. THE COURTS ULTIMATELY OVERTURN THIS LOWER COURT'S DECISION. THIS WILL BE THE LAW HERE IN CALIFORNIA I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IT'S GREAT TO SEE SOME COMPANIES TAKING THAT STEP FORWARD BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA WITH OVER A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES. AND IT'S ABOUT TIME THEY STEPPED UP BECAUSE EVEN YOU YOUNGSTERS HERE AREN'T GOING TO BE HERE IN A HUNDRED AND ONE YEARS IF WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT HARD FOR QUALITY THE TIME TO START IS NOW ACTUALLY THE TIME TO START WAS A LONG TIME AGO. BUT THIS IS A BILL THAT'S GOING TO MOVE US FORWARD AND GOING TO GET US TO A POSITION. WHERE WE CAN LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND FIX THE PROBLEM AND IF PEOPLE LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND ARE WILLING TO FIX THE PROBLEM WE HAVE VARIOUS AGENCIES WHOSE TASK IT IS? TO ACHIEVE THAT LEVEL OF EQUALITY IT WILL GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE HOPEFULLY RESOLVE IT SO WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT. MORE THAN ANOTHER DECADE IF THAT LONG TO ACHIEVE THAT LEVEL OF A QUALITY WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

AND THEY ENGAGE IN JUST EXTRAORDINARILY EGREGIOUS PAYDAY LENDING TYPE PRACTICES FROM SEIZING PEOPLE'S CARS THE OF CONTRACTS THAT SAY PEOPLE DON'T HAVE FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS. YOU CAN GO IF THERE'S THREE OR FOUR CO SIGNERS YOU CAN GO AND SEIZE THEIR PROPERTY IN THEIR CARS NO LIKE. AND WE HAVE A CULTURE JURISPRUDENTIAL CULTURE IN CALIFORNIA INFORMED BY A PROTECTION OF THE CONSUMER. THERE'S AN ARGUMENT OF COURSE AS TO WHETHER THESE CONSUMER ON PROTECTIONS THAT WE'VE SET FORTH IN THIS MEASURE APPLY IN THIS IN THE IMMIGRATION AND BAIL CONTEXT COMMISSION CRIMINAL BAIL CONTEXT. AND A LOT OF THESE COMPANIES SAY THEY DON'T UCLA TO THE BIG STUDY THAT SHOWED THESE EXTRAORDINARY PROVISIONS IN CONTRACTS THAT ARE JUST UNCONSCIONABLE SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE CLARIFYING IN MAKING SURE THAT. ALL OF THESE RELEVANT -- PROVISIONS OF THE LAW THAT HAVE TAKEN FIFTY YEARS THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED IN CALIFORNIA DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES AND ALL THE OTHER TYPES OF REMEDIES WE HAVE AVAILABLE. NOW APPLY IN THIS CONTEXT TO BE CLEAR SO THAT -- EVEN IF THE THE BAIL IS IS IT A BIT SB TEN THAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR AND BAILED IT IS REFORM TAKES EFFECT THEY'RE STILL GOING TO BE. A TREMENDOUS COLLECTION SOMETIMES FIVE OR SIX OR TEN YEARS PEOPLE ARE STILL COLLECTING MONEY ON THESE CONTRACTS AND THEY NEED TO IT HERE TO OUR THE UNDERLYING ARCHITECTURE OF BASIC CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW. IS MEAN OF A RIGHT TO COLLECT THEIR MONEY BUT JUST LIKE IN THE DE FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES THEY'VE GOT TO DO IT FAIRLY BASED UPON THE RULE OF LAW THAT APPLIES TO ALL OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WITH THAT I WILL WHO'S GOT FIRST SENATOR THERE ARE AMENDMENTS IN THE BILL YOU'RE TAKING THOSE IS OFTEN CANNELLA MOMENTS. GREAT JOB. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR SWEETNESS PLEASE YES. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DAN A CO WROTE DARNELL I'M AN ATTORNEY AT LAWYERS COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA -- AND PROUD CO SPONSOR OF SBTHREE EIGHTEEN AND WE CREATED THE FIRST LEGAL SERVICES CLINIC AT LAWYERS COMMITTEE DESIGNED TO ASSIST PEOPLE WHO ARE. SUFFERING THE CONSEQUENCES OF CRASHING BAIL THAT AND HELPING THEM UNDERSTAND BOTH THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE CONTRACTS AND THEIR RIGHTS. THE RIGHT TO BE FREE FROM ABUSIVE DECEPTIVE AND UNFAIR TACTICS USED BY COMPANIES WHO CLEARLY HAVE THE UPPER HAND. LET'S NOT FORGET PEOPLE ENTER THESE AGREEMENTS DURING THE MOST STRESSFUL MOMENTS OF THEIR LIVES WHEN EITHER THEY THEMSELVES OR THEIR LOVED ONE IS BEING HELD IN JAIL. LET'S ALSO NOT FORGET. THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS REALLY NOT CONTROVERSIAL. WHY AND WE'RE NOT FOCUSED ON THE UNDERLYING SURETIES ARRANGEMENTS WERE FOCUSED ON THE CONSUMER FACING BAIL BONDS COMPANIES AND WE'RE SAYING? THAT WHEN BAY ON IMMIGRATION BOND PROVIDERS FINANCE THE FEES THAT THEY CHARGE FOR THEIR SERVICES TO CONSUMERS. OFFERING WHAT THE INDUSTRY REFERS TO AS CREDIT BAIL. THAT THEY'RE SUBJECT TO LAWS THAT REGULATE FINANCING AND EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT. WHAT BAY ON IMMIGRATION PONDERED WRITERS COLLECT ON THESE OUTSTANDING DEBTS? THEY'RE SUBJECTTO FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES LAWS WHEN BEILIN IMMIGRATION BOND PROVIDERS ENTER CREDIT BAIL ARRANGEMENTS. BUT PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY HAVE NEGOTIATED WITH IN SPANISH CHINESE TAGALOG VIETNAMESE ARE KOREAN. THEY ARE REQUIRED TO TRANSLATE THESE DOCUMENTS AS REQUIRED BY LAW. UNVEILED IMMIGRATION PROVIDERS PROVIDE SERVICES TO CONSUMERS SUCH AS COURT REMINDERS CRIMINAL COURT INFORMATION TRANSPORTATION FROM JAIL AND WHEN THEY HOLD THEMSELVES OUT TO CONSUMERS AS BAIL SERVICE PROVIDERS. THEIR SUBJECT TO LAWS DESIGNED TO PROTECT CONSUMERS WHO RECEIVE THESE SERVICES. SB THREE EIGHTEEN WILL NOT INVALIDATE THOUSANDS OF CONTRACTS AS THE OPPOSITION CLAIMS. IN FACT THIS CLAIM IS THE INDUSTRY USING THE EXACT SAME TACTICS THEY USE IN ATTEMPTING TO COLLECT DEBTS FROM CONSUMERS THREATENING TO THROW PEOPLE IN JAIL REGARDLESS OF THEIR LEGAL ABILITY TO DO SO. THE OTHER PRIMARY CLAIM BY THE OPPOSITION SEEMS TO BE IT BUT THEY'VE NEVER BEEN REGULATED BY THESE LAWS BEFORE. AND TO WHICH THE ONLY APPROPRIATE RESPONSE IS IGNORANCE OF THE LAW IS NO EXCUSE. AND OUR POSITION THAT AN EXCEPTION TO THIS PRINCIPLE SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO THE BAY ON IMMIGRATION BOND INDUSTRIES. THANK YOU AND I URGE YOU ON BEHALF OF ALL LOW INCOME CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA TO VOTE I ON SB. THREE EIGHTEEN TRISH THANK YOU. THAT'S WITH US PLEASE. MY NAME IS TRACY BILLBOARD IN -- I AM A MOTHER OF BUT FORMALLY INCARCERATED.

AT THAT TIME MY DAUGHTER WAS -- ACCUSED OF THAT AND WHAT WAS SHE WHAT THAT THE THE CRIME ITSELF. THE WHEN WE WENT TO COURT -- THEY GAVE HER THEY TOLD HER THAT SHE'S GOING TO DO TWO TO FIVE YEARS IN JAIL FOR THAT -- THIRTY SEVEN DOLLARS WORTH OF DISHWASHING DETERGENT THAT WAS STOLEN FROM CVS -- WE ARE SURVIVORS OF OF THE WHOLE BILL SYSTEM WHEN MY DAUGHTER. WAS RESTED AND I COULD NOT GET HER OUT OF JAIL -- EXCUSE ME I GET EMOTIONAL JUST THINKING ABOUT THIS IS BECAUSE I'VE LOOK AT IT IS MODERN DAY SLAVERY AND SLAVE MEANT. AND WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS TAKEN FROM ME AND TAKEN. TO TO TO SANTA RITA JAIL WHICH IS ONE OF A JAIL WHERE LIKE NO. NO ONE WANTS TO GO TO AND THIS IS LIKE A YEAR AFTER. THE THE THE THE THEY HAD A A A LAWSUIT AGAINST WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THE WOMEN -- HOW THEY WERE BEING MISTREATED -- WHEN I HAD I HAD NO OTHER CHOICE OTHER THAN WALKING ACROSS THE STREET WHEN THEY REFUSE TO RELEASE MY CHILD? I HAD NO OTHER CHOICE BUT WALKING CROSS STREET AND GOING TO A BILL BONDS AGENCY TO GET HER OUT THEY MIGHT MY DAUGHTER'S BILL WAS A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO I HAD TO PAY TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR LAWYER JUST TO EVEN TRY. TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON WHERE FAMILY WE'VE NEVER HAD ANY. ANY KIND OF DEALINGS WITH THE LAW ENFORCEMENT I'M AN INDIGENOUS WOMAN WHO IS FREE I'VE I'VE ALWAYS LOOKED AT MYSELF YES IN MY CHILD IS BEING FREE. AND WHAT I HAD TO GO THROUGH. A AND IT WAS WAS WAS A GREGIS IN JUST EVEN THE FACT MY MOTHER WAS A COSIGNER AND MY MOTHER ELDERLY WOMAN WHO WAS BEING CALLED IN. AND HARASSED DO YOU KNOW OF FOR THE THE MONEY WE HAD A PAID JUST IN ORDER TO GET HER OUT WE HAD A PAID TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS TO GET HER OUT. AFTER A YEAR OF PAYING TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH. THE BILL THE THE THE THE PAY WAS STILL THE SAY IT NEVER CHANGED IT NEVER CHIANG SOUL. LUCKILY I GET ON THE ELEVATOR CENTER. WAS ABLE TO COME IN AND STEP IN AND HELP ME IN COLOR YOU LOOK A COLOR CHANGE WAS ABLE TO COME IN AND HELP ME PAY OFF THE BILL. BUT I LOST MY BUSINESS. IT'S THREE YEARS LATER I I YOU KNOW I'VE I DID EVERYTHING TO SELL MY BODY AND MY SOUL IN ORDER FOR THIS DEBT TO BE PAID OFF. I'M STILL THREE YEARS LATER. I'VE LOST ALMOST EVERYTHING WE LOST OUR CARS -- IS EMBARRASSING YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU COME FROM OF YOU KNOW IN A IN YOUR IN A COMMUNITY WHERE NO ONE YOU KNOW YOU NEVER. KNOW HAVE ANY INCARCERATION NOT ALL OF IT JUST BECAUSE I'M A PERSON OF COLOR DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE ALL HAVE BEEN IN THE SYSTEM. IN SOLD WHEN YOU'RE IN THIS IN A IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO DO EXCEPT FOR WALK ACROSS THE STREET. AND GET YOUR CHILD AND JUST TO FIND OUT THAT I'M ONLY 5% OF THE NATION IT ACTUALLY BILLS THEIR CHILDREN OUT OF JAIL OR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS ONLY 5% OF US DO THAT. ONLY 5% MOST PEOPLE LET THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS LADY IN LIFE. IN JAIL TO BE [inaudible] YOU KNOW. SUBJECTED TO WHATEVER MY DAUGHTER WHEN MY DAUGHTER CAME HOME EVEN AFTER FOUR DAYS IN JAIL MY DAUGHTER CAME HOME SHE STONE. THE STENCH FROM HER. YOU KNOW HER FINGERNAILS WERE DIRTY IT IS OVER THIRTY SEVEN DOLLARS WORTH THE LAUNDRY DETERGENT MY DAUGHTER'S TWENTY THREE YEARS ALL RIGHT NOW AND CAN'T GET A JOB. BECAUSE SHE STILL HAS A RECORD. FOR THIRTY SEVEN DOLLARS AND I'M STILL PAYING. YOU KNOW FORT SO EVEN THOUGH THE BILL HAS BEEN PAID OFF. I'M STILL PAYING. SO I HAVE LIKE YOU KNOW. MY LIFE IS IT HAS BEEN DESTROYED OVER. ALLEGATION AND SO I JUST FEEL LIKE -- PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT HOW AGREE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS AND HOW PREDATORY IT IS UPON US. IN THE PEOPLE AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT PEOPLE OF COLOR IS REALLY ABOUT CLASS. IT'S ABOUT IF YOU JUST DON'T HAVE MONEY IF YOU KNOW IF WE'RE JUST TRYING TO SURVIVE IN THIS WORLD AND AND THEN YOU GET LIKE THIS MODERN DAY SLAVERY. THAT THAT MAKES IT SO THAT YOU CAN'T. GET OUT OF OUT OF THE RED. YOU KNOW I I WANT I WANT MY DAUGHTER TO BE SUCCESSFUL I HAD TO CHOOSE. I HAD TO CHOOSE THE BILL PAYING OVER MY DAUGHTER GOING TO COLLEGE. LIKE THAT TO ME IS STUPID. IT'S JUST IT MAKES NO SENSE MY DAUGHTER DIDN'T GET TO GO CAUGHT. BECAUSE I HAD TO PAY. THIS BILL AND I HAD TO YOU KNOW WE'RE IN THE SYSTEM AND THEN EVEN AFTER ALL OF THAT IT'S STILL ON A RECORD AND IT WAS. IT WAS IT WAS REDUCED TO A MISDEMEANOR. DISTURBING THE PEACE AND STILL EVEN THOUGH WE HAD TO PAY THIS THE SYSTEM WAS STILL PAYING. WE LOST EVERYTHING. AND SO WHAT I WANT TO DO IS JUST I WANTED TO COME HERE TO TELL MY STORY SO PEOPLE KNOW THAT NOT ALL OF US COME FROM CRIMINAL BACKGROUNDS AND EVEN IF WE CAN AND THEN THE EVEN IF YOU DO COME FROM THAT. HE'S STILL IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT FAIR WE JUST NEED IT AND LIKE. JUST BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW THE LAW LIKE THE CONTRACTS THAT WE HAD THAT I HAD TO SIGN I HAD NO IDEA I WAS SIGNING MY LIFE AWAY I HAD NO IDEA I JUST WANTED TO GET MY DAUGHTER OUT OF THE SYSTEM. THAT I KNOW THAT WAS GOING TO GET SHE SHE STILL IT DESTROYED HER FOUR DAYS IN JAIL STILL DESTROYED HER. AND MOST PEOPLE LIKE I KNOW MOST PEOPLE CANNOT AFFORD TO GET THEIR LOVED ONES OUT OF THAT SYSTEM. AND THAT'S IT'S JUST NOT FAIR. IT'S NOT FAIR. AND SO I JUST DO NOT URGENT I VOTE. YOU KNOW FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE THERE ARE YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID IT'S NOT ABOUT. COLOR IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT ABOUT RELIGION IS IT'S ABOUT CLASS TOO YOU KNOW SO WAS THIS IS ABOUT ALL OF THAT BUT WE ARE ALL SUFFERING. WERE ALL SUFFERING FROM THE SYSTEM THAT. IS MAKING MONEY OFF OF PEOPLE WHO CAN ACTUALLY. PUT MORE INTO THIS THIS COUNTRY MORE INTO OUR COMMUNITIES MORE INSOFAR COUNTIES WARRANTS ARE CITIES WE COULD DO A LOT MORE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE TO BE. YOU KNOW. WE DO IF WE DO HAVE PREDATORS UPON US [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE. THANKS TO CHAIR TED MERMAN FROM THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION -- PROUD CO SPONSOR THE BILL CLICKS MEMBERS ARE MORE THAN A DOZEN LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO WORK WITH THOUSANDS OF LOW INCOME CONSUMERS FROM AROUND THE STATE TOO MANY OF WHOM HAVE HAD. NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES WITH THE BAIL BONDS AND IMMIGRATION BONDS INDUSTRY -- SB THREE EIGHTEEN IS A VERY USEFUL -- CLARIFICATION OF EXISTING LAW. AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU. CAN FLOOR IN BEHALF OF WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. STERN MEMBERS KEVIN BIG OF AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF CALIFORNIA ALSO IN SUPPORT FOR ELOQUENT. TESTIMONY GIVEN BY THE AUTHOR IN THE PRIOR WITNESSES THANK. THANK. AND I ORDERS GO WITH CHIRLA AND WE ARE STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE MY NAME IS TOTAL PADILLA. I'M A BILL AGENT. FOR THIRTY SIX YEARS. WHAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW IN A LOT OF WHAT WAS ADDRESS JUST NOW HAS TO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS NOTHING? AT ALL TO DO WITH WHAT WE DO. WE GIVE PEOPLE THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT THAT THEY HAVE. THAT SHOULD THEY BE THROWN IN JAIL. THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO BAIL THEMSELVES OUT OF JAIL. WITHOUT ANOTHE GOVERNMENT AGENCY BEING THE ONE THAT WATCHES OVER THEM. SO I HAD TO TOUCH ON THAT FIRST. SB THREE EIGHTEEN SIX TO SOLELY. HAVE THE BAIL INDUSTRY. HOW ARE DOCUMENTS TRANSLATED INTO FOUR OTHER FOREIGN LANGUAGES? THAT'S WHAT IT DOES SO ALL THE THINGS THAT WERE DRESSED HAVE TO DO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND SOME OF THE HYPERBOLE EASE OF THE SENTENCES THE BAIL AMOUNTS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS BILL FOR ME. SB. TEN ADDRESSES THAT AND TAKE CARE OF THAT A REFERENDUM WOULD DEAL WITH THAT LATER. SO GETTING BACK ON TRACK THERE'S OVER SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED LANGUAGES IN THIS IN THIS WORLD OF OURS. MANDARIN CHINESE IS THE MOST POPULAR LANGUAGE. WHEN I IS A BAIL BONDSMAN? GO TO TWO AVAILABLE ON NUMBER ONE I TAKE GREAT OFFENSE TO BE. INPUT IS A PAYDAY LENDER. WHEN BAIL IS SET ON SOMEBODY IF THEY DO NOT HAVE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY? THE TWO FOR THE BELMONT WE DO EXTEND CREDIT. OUR INDUSTRY DOES NOT. CHARGE INTEREST WE DO NOT. GO TAKE PEOPLE'S CARS WE DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAKE AWAY SOMEBODY'S FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHT. DON'T PLEASE DON'T TAKE THAT MAY WE HELP PEOPLE THAT ARE IN CUSTODY WE GET THEM OUT OF CUSTODY. YES WE EXTEND CREDIT. WHEN I HEAR THE FOR PROFIT BILL INDUSTRY IT MAKES ME ILL TO MY STOMACH? EVERY BUSINESS IN THIS COUNTRY. THAT I KNOW OF ITS FOR PROFIT LESS THEY ARE A NON PROFIT. THAT IS NOT AN UGLY WORD AND SHOULDN'T BE USED. TO FOR THE EMOTIONAL ASPECT OF THIS BILL SO. BACK TO WHAT WE DO AN EXERCISE IN PEOPLE GIVE THEM THE RIGHT. WE'RE INSURANCE AGENTS ISSUING AN INSURANCE POLICY. TO THESTATE OF CALIFORNIA GUARANTEEING SOMEBODY'S APPEARANCE IN COURT. THAT SHOULD NOT BE TABOO. THAT SHOULD BE ACCEPTED AND LOVED AND APPRECIATED BY THOSE THAT A JUDGE WILL NOT ALLOW TO BE RELEASED FROM JAIL. AND NOW THE ONLY RIGHT AND ONLY ABILITY THEY HAVE TO BE RELEASED FROM JAIL IS TO CALL AVAILABLE. IF THE BILLS ARE TOO HIGH THEN WE'LL DEAL WITHOUT ON ANOTHER AND ANOTHER. WE TRIED TO DEAL WITH THAT FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND THIS VERY LEGISLATURE TO TRY AND GET THE BILL'S LOWERED OUR INDUSTRY DID. V. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MUST BE KNOWN IS THAT THERE'S PENDING LITIGATION THERE IS PENDING LITIGATION GOING ON RIGHT NOW AND AND SOME OF THE FOLKS THAT IF YOU'VE JUST HEARD FROM. ARE INVOLVED IN THAT. AND THAT IS REALLY. TO HAVE KNOWING THAT THEY'VE GOT PENDING LITIGATION AND THEY'RE GOING TO USE THIS LEGISLATURE TO HELP. YOU KNOW IN THAT CASE BECAUSE THIS DIRECTLY AFFECTS THAT CASE HE WHEN WE DEAL WITH OUR CLIENTS BLESSING I'M GONNA DO IS GO IN THERE AND AND TALK TO SOMEBODY OR DO BUSINESS WITH SOMEBODY IF THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING. I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT YES THEY ARE UNDER GREAT PRESSURE YES SOMEBODY'S IN JAIL AND THEY'RE SOMEBODY THAT KNOWS THAT THAT'S ME IS A BAIL AGE. AND I HAVE THE COMPASSION. TO GET THESE PEOPLE IN THIS VERY TRYING. CONCERNING NEED TO HELP THEM IN THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS GET THAT PERSON OUT OF JAIL AND I'LL BE DOING IF YOU THINK I'M GONNA GO. YOUR BAIT AND SWITCH ON SOMEBODY. HAVE THEM WAVE THEIR FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS. WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING ME. THEY DO UNDERSTAND AS WE BRING FAMILY MEMBERS THAT DO COME IN IF THERE IS A NEED FOR FOREIGN LANGUAGE WE BRING THEM IN. TO HELP US TRANSLATE AND HELP THEM UNDERSTAND. WE ARE THE ONLY LINE OF INSURANCE. THERE IF YOU DO NOT MAKE YOUR PAYMENT TO US. ON MY CAR INSURANCE LIFE INSURANCE HEALTH INSURANCE IN ANY OTHER FORM OF INSURANCE IN THIS STATE AND COUNTRY WE CANNOT CANCEL OUR INSURANCE POLICY. I CANNOT CANCEL THAT INSURANCE POLICY FOR NON PAYMENT OF PREMIUM. HEALTH INSURANCE CAR INSURANCE LIFE INSURANCE THEY CAN'T WE CAN'T. I CAN'T GO ARREST SOMEBODY AND THROW THEM BACK IN JAIL. SHOULD THEY MISS A PAYMENT. I CAN'T DO THAT. THROWN BACK IN JAIL FAMOUS COURT. SO THE BOTTOM LINE WITH THIS IS SB THREE EIGHTEEN AS ABOUT. OUR DOCUMENTS BEING TRANSLATED INTO FOREIGN LANGUAGE BECAUSE THIS COULD MISCONCEPTION OF PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND WE'RE FORCING PEOPLE TO SIGN THESE CONTRACTS THAT IS NOT THE CASE. AND THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS IS THE RETROACTIVITY OF SUCH THIS BILL THAT IS IN IT. IF THIS BILL PASSES. IT WILL GO RETROACTIVE TO EVERY SINGLE CONTRACT IN EVERY SINGLE PERSON I HAVE OUT ON BAIL RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK. AND THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY. AS WELL AS THOSE THAT DO -- MONEY THEY DO AND HAVE ENTERED INTO A LEGAL CONTRACT AT THE TIME WE ENTERED INTO IT. I WILL BE FORCED. AND THIS IS A FACT THIS IS NOT A HYPERBOLE ALL MY CONTRACTS WILL BE KNOWN VOID SHOULD THIS PASS. FROM MY LIABILITY TO GO OUT AND GET THOSE PEOPLE AND PUT THEM BACK IN JAIL. BECAUSE I WILL HAVE A KNOWN VOID CONTRACT OUR COURT SYSTEMS WILL BE AN UPSIDE DOWN THAT IS NOT A HYPERBOLE I WILL HAVE TO THROW PEOPLE BACK IN JAIL. THAT SHOULD NOT BE THROWN BACK IN JAIL BECAUSE I HAVE KNOWN WHAT CONTRACT [inaudible] IN CLOSING. I A I SAY TO YOU THIS -- THIS BILL IS ABOUT TRANSLATING DOCUMENTS INTO FOREIGN LANGUAGES. I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT. I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM WITH DOING THAT. I WOULD MAKE SURE TO DO THAT. CERTAINLY I DON'T THINK ANYBODY UP HERE. WANTS TO HAVE SOMEBODY FROM A COUNTRY THAT. MAY NOT HAVE THE LANGUAGE WE SPEAK YOUR RELATIVELY AND OFTEN. AND THEY'RE IN JAIL AND NOW I CAN'T GET AMOUNT BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE MY DOCUMENTS TRANSLATED IN ONE OF THE SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED FOREIGN LANGUAGES THAT EXIST IN THIS COUNTRY. WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. WE DON'T DO THAT. WE DO HAVE COMPASSION. THIS FOR PROFIT ASPECT OF WHAT IS BEING USED TO LOBBY FOR THIS BILL IS DISCUSSED. AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU THE NEXT WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. BOB MARK SEGMENT OF BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PROPERTY CASUALLY INSURANCE ASSOCIATION IN THE OVEN THE SHIRT INFIDELITY ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA OUR BIGGEST CONCERN IS THE POTENTIAL RETROACTIVE APPLICATION OF THIS LAW. AT LEAST AS THE WITNESSES STATED THERE IS LITIGATION ON THIS I DO BELIEVE THAT REASONABLE WHITES DO DIFFERENT WHETHER NOT THESE PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN APPLIED -- PREVIOUSLY WHAT HAPPENS IF THIS LAGOS DURING CLARIFIES AND THERE ARE POLICIES OUT THERE THAT ARE NO LONGER THE FACT THIS HAS BOTH AN IMPACT ON THE THE BAIL AGENT THE INDIVIDUAL HAS BEEN BAIL THAT DOES HAVE A IMPACT ON THE UNDER LIGHT SHOW CHARITY WHICH IS WHY WERE POST. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THING NONE LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS [inaudible] LIKE. TO YEAH ONE QUESTION FOR THE LAST WEEK. SO IT IS IT YOUR VIEW THAT IF THIS WERE TO PASS SAYING THAT IT'S CLARIFYING EXISTING LAW -- THAT THAT WOULD SORT OF BE DISPOSITIVE OF THE MATTER AS FAR AS THE COURTS -- CONCERNED THAT BECAUSE TODAY'S LEGISLATURE HAS GIVEN ITS INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING LAW -- A COURT WOULD AUTOMATICALLY APPLY THAT SAME INTERPRETATION WELL I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY AND I TRY TO PLAY ONE ON TV BUT I THINK THE COURT WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME. OVERCOMING THE LEGISLATIVE FIAT THAT THIS IS A CLARIFICATION EXISTING LAW AND THEREFORE IT'S BEEN IN EFFECT FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. BUT THAT THAT BEYOND AS IT WERE WOULDN'T. ACTUALLY APPLY IT RETROACTIVELY IT WOULD SIMPLY EXPRESSED THE OPINION OF TODAY'S LEGISLATURE AS TO WHAT. YESTERDAY LEGISLATURE LEGISLATURE TO PASS THAT INTENDED CRACKS THAT WOULD NECESSARILY BE DISPOSITIVE. I WOULD AS SOON THAT ANY GOOD ATTORNEY WHO HAS ISSUES WITH THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS WOULD TAKE THE LEGISLATIVE A CLARIFICATION THAT IS EXISTING LAW. AND I WOULD BE SURPRISED THAT AND GO AFTER EXISTING POLICY SAYING THEY WERE INVALID. WHICH IS TO SAY TO MAKE SENSE TO ME. YEAH THE OTHER ONE THAT'S AYE AYE BEING RETROACTIVE RETROACTIVE -- NUMBER IT IS RETROACTIVE AND I I DO WANT TO SAY ONE THING AND I INSPIRED ONE WAS WHAT HE SAID. WHY ARE THE OTHER LINES OF INSURANCE AND I HATE TO SAY THIS WHY THE OTHER LINES OF INSURANCE? NOT INCLUDED IN THIS WHY IS IT JUST THE BAIL BOND INDUSTRY WHY ARE ALL THE LINES OF INSURANCE WHY ARE ALL CONTRACTS USE ME. JUST ANSWER QUESTIONS IF THERE'S A QUESTION THE TASK I DON'T WE ASK THAT YOU RESPOND TO THE QUESTIONS OPPOSED TO POSING ANOTHER QUESTION. YOUR QUESTION ANSWERED THANK YOU. SORRY. THANK YOU [inaudible] ALSO. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE -- CENTER WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE I SURE WOULD AND I GLANCE OF THE QUESTIONS IN THAT CLOSE [inaudible] SO. IN MAY. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN UCLA. CONDUCTED A STUDY. THAT STUDY DESPITE WHAT YOU HEARD BY ONE BAIL AGENT. WHO HAS BEEN THE LEADER OF THIS FIGHT ON HIS SIDE? EXAMINE FOUR HUNDRED BAIL CONTRACTS. NOT ONE NOT [inaudible] TEN FOUR HUNDRED AND THAT. STUDY IN FORMS THE BASIS. OF THIS BILL. BECAUSE IN GOING THROUGH THOSE. FOUR HUNDRED OUR CONTRACTS WHAT WE DID LEARN IN THOSE EXACT CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS. THAT PEOPLE THAT COULD CONSUMERS ARE ASKED TO WAIT THE FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS. THAT THEY WERE ASKED A TWO I CAN GO THROUGH IMAGE IS USED EXTRAORDINARY THING THAT I REPRESENTED AS SET FORTH IN THIS STUDY TO THE EXTENT SOMEONE -- IS HERE IT REQUIRES -- PEOPLE SIGNING THE CONTRACTS TO A SURRENDER THEIR LOVED ONES TO JAIL. IT REQUIRES A DEMIURGE TO BE FULLY ARE LIABLE FOR ANY ADDITIONAL EXPENSES. IT HAS HUGE HIDDEN FEES WE HAVE EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE THAT ARE A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR TO PREMIUM RESULTING IN FORTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN COSTS. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES LAW YOU LOOK AT ALL THE LAWS THAT WE'RE SEEKING TO APPLY ONLY ONE DEALS WITH LANGUAGE INTERPRETATION THE REST DEAL WITH THE BROUGHT BROUGHT HISTORY. OF PROTECTIONS AND INFORMATION AND MAKING SURE CONSUMERS PARTICULARLY AS WAS SO APPROPRIATELY AND ELOQUENTLY ARTICULATED HERE THEY'RE IN THE MOST VULNERABLE OF THEIR SITUATIONS. AND WE HAVE A KHN CONCEPT THE LOCAL THAT HE'S IN CONTRACTS AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS IS WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT TIME WE WANT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE FULLY INFORMED MAKE WHATEVER DECISIONS. BUT THEY'RE FULLY INFORMED SO THIS IS NOT SOMETHING WHERE -- IT'S ANYTHING FURTHER THAN A STEP TO MAKE TO TRULY SHINE LIGHT ON THESE HORRIBLE PRACTICES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS AND THE ABUSIVE NATURE. OF THESE INSTITUTIONS AND WHAT THEY'VE DONE WE HAVE A HUGE NUMBER REPORTS WE SEATED HERE YOUR TESTIMONY NOT JUST ABOUT THE IMPACT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT ABOUT THE HARASSING TELEPHONE CALLS. TO HER MOTHER AND ALL OF THOSE THOSE ISSUES SECONDLY. THE AS THE ANALYSIS SO APPROPRIATELY POINTS OUT THE ARGUMENTS MADE BY THE OTHER SIDE CONSERVING RECTOR ACTIVITIES SEEM RECURSIVE. ON THE ONE TAUGHT HIGH AND THEY'RE ARGUING WILL THIS DOESN'T APPLY TO US WE'RE NOT WE'RE SHIRLEY COMPANY IT DOESN'T APPLY BUT IF IT DOES APPLY YOU CAN'T APPLY IT RIGHT IN THE IT IS A COURT CASE WOULD YOU SITE WHICH WE REALLY APPRECIATE. THAT BUT BASICALLY ON POINT DIRECTS THIS ISSUE ABOUT THE POWER OF FUTURE LEGISLATURE'S TO CLARIFY THE LAW TO EITHER A YOU'RE EXTENDING IT GOING FORWARD OR BE YOUR CLARIFYING IT BUT IN EITHER INSTANCE. THIS IS THIS IS A CORNERSTONE OF WHAT WE SOUGHT TO DO AND WE'VE HAD IT INDUSTRY THAT HAS TRIED TO DEFINE ITSELF HONESTLY I DID UNDERSTAND THE DISTINCTIONS THEY MADE UNTIL I START GETTING THIS FIGHT TWO YEARS AGO. AND THEY WANTED TO SAY WERE SURELY AND WE'RE TO SHOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY AND THE LIKE WHICH RESULTED IN THE UCLA STUDY AND RESULTED IN THE OUR EXPOSURE OF THESE. WHO ORDINARILY? OPPRESSIVE APPROACH TO THESE CONTRACTS WERE PEOPLE ORDER TOUGH SITUATIONS AND THERE'S HUGE PRESS REPORTS WE COULD BROUGHT THEM AND SHARE THEM WITH THIS COMMITTEE LET ALONE ALL THE THE THE THE THE EXAMPLES THAT WE'VE SEEN. OF THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR THIS IS AN INDUSTRY THAT NEEDS TO TO IT HERE TO THESE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES AS LONG AS THEY CONTINUE TO EXIST. AND IN THE MEAN TIME OUR JOB IS TO PROTECT EVERY LIFE TO PROTECT LIBERTY OF EVERYONE AND IF THERE IS SOMETHING ON THE BALLOT IN THE FUTURES THAT MAY OR MAY NOT DETERMINE WHAT THE FUTURE IS. WELL IMPORTANT THAT WE START NOW AND WE PROTECT PEOPLE EVERY SINGLE DAY SO WHAT HAPPENED HER DAUGHTER DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU BETTER.

TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU. TO YEAR AMAZING STAFF TEAM FOR ALL THEIR ASSISTANCE WITH THIS BILL MISTER CHAIR AND THEN BEGIN BY SAYING THIS IS A COMPLICATED IN CANDIDLY AT TIMES A BIT OF A DIDN'T ISSUE. BUT I THINK THAT WERE ADVANCING A SIMPLE SOLUTION THAT'S BEEN NEGOTIATED IN A VERY GRATEFUL FOR ALL THE WORK ON ALL SIDES. SB THREE SEVEN SEVEN IS THE CLEAN UP BILL. WHICH IS FROM A PREVIOUS PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT PROTECTS FOSTER YOUTH FROM THE LONG TERM SIDE EFFECTS. OF INAPPROPRIATELY PRESCRIBED PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE CHAIR FOR ALL OF HIS WORK IN THIS AREA -- AND AGAIN MISTER THANK YOU FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE WITH THE BILL. THE STATE IS GUARDIAN TO APPROXIMATELY SIXTY THOUSAND KIDS AND YOUNG ADULTS AND FOSTER CARE. AND WE HOLD THE RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF THIS VULNERABLE POPULATION. THIS BILL EXTENDS A MONITORING THE ADMINISTRATION OF MIND NUMBING PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION THAT CAN LEAD AND HAS LED TO A REVERSIBLE IN LIFELONG HEALTH IMPACTS. IF NOT PRESCRIBED APPROPRIATELY. IN AN EFFORT TO BE ABLE TO CRACK DOWN ON EXCESSIVE AND UNNECESSARY PSYCHOTROPIC PRESCRIBING A FOSTER YOUTH. THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A SERIES OF BILLS IN FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN THOSE BILLS BUT INCLUDED SB. ELEVEN SEVENTY FOUR WHICH WAS INTENDED TO GIVE THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD DATED TO INVESTIGATE POTENTIAL CASES OF INAPPROPRIATE PRESCRIBING. SB ELEVEN SEVENTY FOUR BUILT OFF AN EXISTING DATA SHARING AGREEMENT IN ESTABLISH A FORMAL. ONGOING PROCESS FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD TO BE ABLE TO REVIEW IN CONFIDENTIALLY CONFIDENTIAL INVESTIGATE PSYCH MADE PRESCRIPTION PATTERNS OUTSIDE THE STANDARD OF CARE. FOR FAST YOU TWO BEEN ON THREE OR MORE PSYCH MEDS FOR NINETY DAYS OR MORE. DH CS WOULD PROVIDE TO THE MEDICAL BOARD THE FOLLOWING FOR ARIES NUMBER ONE A LIST OF PSYCH MEDS THAT WERE PRESCRIBED. NUMBER TWO THE START AND STOP DATES OF EACH MEDICATION THREE THE FOSTER USE DATE OF BIRTH AND FOR THE STRENGTH AND QUANTITY MEDICATION. AND THEIR NUMBER OF DAYS SUPPLY OF MEDICATION. MEDICAL BOARD. ELEVEN SEVENTY FOUR WITHIN CONTRACT WITH AN EXPERT PSYCHIATRISTS WHO SPECIALIZES IN PEDIATRIC CARE TO REVIEW THE DATA. TO DETERMINE IF AN ACCUSATION. OF INAPPROPRIATE PRESCRIBING SHOULD BE MADE WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. ELEVEN SEVENTY FOUR WAS A REALLY IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN PROVIDING OVERSIGHT FOR STATES FOSTER YOUTH. THE MEDICAL BOARD HAS SINCE THOUGH INDICATED AND WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL TO MISS MOST WHO'S HERE SHE'S BEEN LIVING THE DREAM ON THIS ISSUE -- HAS INDICATED THAT DATA SHARED -- IN THAT BILL. DOES NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH INFORMATION FOR THEM TO INVESTIGATE PRESCRIBING PATTERNS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CRITICAL MEDICAL INFORMATION SUCH AS THE SIMPSONS. IN DIAGNOSIS FOR THE PSYCH MED PRESCRIPTION. CURRENTLY WHEN MEDICAL BOARD FLAG THE CASE THEY WANT TO LOOK INTO THEY MUST GO THROUGH DSS. AS A LIAISON TO ASK FOR PERMISSION TO CONTACT THE YOUTH. MEDICAL BOARD PROVIDES THE SS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFYING NUMBER WHICH THEN DSS MATCHES TO A NAME OF A CURRENT OR FORMER FOSTER YOUTH. DSS AND I APOLOGIZE ABOUT THIS DSS THEN SENDS A LETTER TO THE LAST KNOWN ADDRESS OF THE FOSTER YOUTH. IN THE COUNTY ASKING FOR PERMISSION TO ALLOW THE MEDICAL BOARD TO CONTACT THE FOSTER YOUTH. IF DSS GETS A LETTER BACK WITH APPROVAL CANDIDLY THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED -- ON A REGULAR BASIS. THE MEDICAL BOARD THEN MUST CONTACT THE CHILD THE YOUTH AGAIN TO ASK FOR THE AUTHORIZATION. THE RELEASE OF MEDICAL RECORDS. LONG STORY SHORT. AS YOU CAN TELL THIS PROCESS THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE OVERLY CUMBERSOME -- IN THE MEDICAL BOARD HAS BEEN UNABLE TO CARRY OUT THEIR STATUTORY OVERSIGHT REQUIREMENTS. WHEN GIVEN EXAMPLE? IN THE FIRST BATCH OF CASES THE MEDICAL BOARD LOOKED AT THE EXPERT FLAG THE EIGHTY SIX USE THAT NEEDED MORE INFORMATION ON DSS IN EIGHTY SIX LETTERS OUT. BUT ONLY RECEIVED. FIVE FIVE RESPONSES GIVING MEDICAL BOARD THE AUTHORIZATION TO CONTACT THE FOSTER YOUTH. AFTER CONTACTING THE YOUTH MEDICAL WERE IS ABLE TO GET AUTHORIZATION OUT OF THOSE. FIVE FOR THREE THIS BROKEN PROCESS IS PROVEN INEFFECTIVE IN PROTECTING CALIFORNIA'S FAST YOUTH FROM OVER PRESCRIBING. SB THREE SEVEN SEVEN WILL CUT THROUGH THE RED TAPE IN FINDING ALLOW THE MEDICAL BOARD TO GET ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO CONFIDENTIALLY INVESTIGATE. BY GRANTING AUTHORIZATION WHEN THE MEDICATION IS AUTHORIZED BY THE COURTS CURRENTLY ALL CYCLE TRIPIT MEDS FOR MINORS AND PASSED YOUTH MUST BE APPROVED BY A JUVENILE COURT JUDGE VIA THE FORM J. BETWEEN. TWO TWENTY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH ALL SIDES ON A SOLUTION TO THIS ISSUE. AND I'M REALLY GRATEFUL FOR ALL SIDES WHO'VE BEEN ENGAGING IN THIS PROCESS. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL THE NET BOARD WHO IS NOW IN SUPPORT -- IN THE DEPENDENCY ATTORNEYS WHO NOW REMOVED THEIR OPPOSITION. HERE'S HOW IT'S GONNA WORK IN THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR -- FOR YOUR LENIENCY ALLOW AND TO BE EXPLAINED THE PROCESS AND I APOLOGIZE TO YOU AND TO THE MEMBERS. SB THREE SEVEN SEVEN WILL REQUIRE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO INCLUDE IN THEIR PSYCH MEDS FORMS THE JB. TWO TWENTY A REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION FOR THE RELEASE OF MEDICAL INFORMATION. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL BE REQUIRED TO BE TO WORK WITH VERY STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING FAST YOUTH ADVOCATES DEPENDENCY ATTORNEYS NDSS TO ENSURE THE REQUEST HIS **** IN A MANNER THAT PROTECTS THE CHILD'S MEDICAL PRIVACY. IN ADDITION TO DRESSING NEW CASES A POSSIBLE OVER PRESCRIBING SB THREE SEVEN SEVEN WILL ALSO ESTABLISH A WORKING GROUP TO DEVELOP AN EFFECTIVE OUT REACH METHOD. FOR FOSTER YOUTH WHO HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS POTENTIAL OVER PRESCRIBED IN THE PAST -- IT WILL ALSO ALLOW REQUIREMENTS OF SB ELEVEN SEVENTY FOUR TO BE REALIZED A WHICH WE ALL INTENDED TO DO. I AGAIN APOLOGIZE FOR THE LENGTHY TESTIMONY HERE TODAY. IT HAS BEEN A RATHER DIFFICULT I NEED TO PEEL BACK. I'M GRATEFUL FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED SPECIAL YOU MISTER CHAIR -- IN RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND YOU HAVE JENNIFER SOMOS WHO'S BEEN ON THE FRONTLINE TO THIS ON TAKE MONTHS TO THINKING MISS MOST. FOR WORKING WITH US -- TWO YEARS AGO AND AGAIN THIS YEAR ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE SHE'S HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SENATOR AND JUST.

TO PASS A BECAUSE THE AMENDMENTS ARE IMPRENSA RIDES BUT THAT'S THE WORK ALREADY SPENT ON OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS YES THANK YOU -- SO OUR COLLEAGUES AT THIS BILL -- IT MIGHT SEEM FAMILIAR BECAUSE LAST YEAR THIS COMMITTEE PASSED -- AND THE LEGISLATURE PASSED IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED SB TEN FORTY FIVE I TO CREATE A NEW HOUSING CONSERVATORSHIP AS A PILOT PROGRAM. IN SAN FRANCISCO LOS ANGELES AND SAN DIEGO COUNTIES -- TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE VERY REAL A CRISIS THAT IS UNFOLDING ON OUR STREETS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL SEVERELY. ADDICTED -- AND WHO ARE UNRAVELLING AND LITERALLY DYING ON OUR STREETS -- THIS IS ABOUT A VERY RELATIVELY SMALL. GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT CAPABLE OF ACCEPTING VOLUNTARY SERVICES AND WHO WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO REACH -- THROUGH TRADITIONAL OFFERING A VOLUNTARY. SERVICES AND WE OWE IT TO THEM -- TO SAVE THEIR LIVES -- AND SO SB -- FORTY IS -- AND A FOLLOW UP TO SB TEN FORTY FIVE THE BILL THAT IS BEFORE YOU TODAY -- IS -- TIGHTER IN TERMS OF PROCESS -- IT IS MORE PROTECTIVE THAN OF CIVIL LIBERTIES EVEN THEN SB -- TEN FORTY FIVE WAS -- AS WITH TEN SB TEN FORTY FIVE AND EXISTING CONSERVATORSHIP LAWS HAS STRONG STRONG DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS IN TERMS OF JUDICIAL OVERSIGHT -- PEOPLE GETTING ACCESS TO A DEFENSE ATTORNEY IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER -- AND THE BILL -- REALLY DEEPLY PROTECTS PEOPLE CIVIL LIBERTIES WHILE ALSO CREATING A NEW TOOL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE SAVING PEOPLE'S LIVES. ON THE BILL -- REQUIRES VARIOUS STOPS IN ORDER FOR THIS CONSERVATORSHIP TO APPLY IT YOU CANNOT EVEN BE CONSIDERED FOR THIS CONSERVATORSHIP UNLESS YOU HAVE BEEN FIFTY ONE FIFTY EIGHT TIMES. IN A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD A MINIMUM OF EIGHT TIMES ON SOME PEOPLE ASK ME WHAT OUT ONE APPLY TO ANYONE UNFORTUNATELY IT DOES APPLY TO PEOPLE BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THAT LEVEL. OF CRISIS -- BILL REQUIRES -- IT'S A STEP INCREASE -- AFTER THE EIGHT FIFTY ONE FIFTIES THERE'S A TWENTY EIGHT DAY TEMPORARY CONSERVATORSHIP -- AND THEN -- AFTER POTENTIALLY A THIRD JUDGE TRIAL OR JURY TRIAL IF ONE'S REQUESTED -- IT CAN BE EXTENDED AS FAR AS LONG AS SIX MONTHS -- THIS IS SHORTENING THE CONSERVATORSHIP FROM LAST YEAR SB TEN FORTY FIVE PROVIDE UP TO A YEAR -- THE MAXIMUM IS NOW -- SIX MONTHS -- THE BILL MAKES OUR VARIOUS -- CLARIFYING. AMENDMENTS AROUND ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT -- TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO WILL NOT BENEFIT WHO ARE NOT MEDICALLY ELIGIBLE FOR A T. ARE NOT BEING FORCED INTO A T. -- AND THE BILL MAKES OTHER CLARIFICATIONS SOUGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THIS CONSERVATORSHIP CAN ACTUALLY. BE IMPLEMENTED I WANT TO BE VERY VERY CLEAR AND I RESPECT THE OPPOSITION THIS BILL I WILL SAY THAT OVER THE COURSE OF LAST YEAR AND A HALF -- THE OPPOSITION WANT TO THANK THEM FOR KNOWLEDGE BEING THAT FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE -- THE BILL IS -- WELL THEY DON'T SUPPORT IT IS LESS PROBLEMATIC FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE THAN IT WAS. BEFORE AND WE WORK CLOSELY WITH SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND NOW THIS COMMITTEE -- TO TRY TO ADDRESS CONCERNS -- WHILE STILL HAVING AN EFFECTIVE. PROGRAM THIS IS A TOOL OF LAST RESORT -- THIS IS A TOOL TO BE USED FOR PEOPLE FOR WHOM WE HAVE BEEN ON ABLE TO HELP. WITH TRADITIONAL VOLUNTARY SERVICES I'M A HUGE SUPPORTER OF VOLUNTARY SERVICES THAT IS ALWAYS THE PER HEARD APPROACH. BY IN A TINY PERCENTAGE OF CASES VOLUNTARY SERVICES SIMPLY AREN'T WORKING -- AND PEOPLE ARE DETERIORATING AND DYING SO I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF FROM CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS -- IN SAN FRANCISCO DID RECENTLY VOTE -- ALMOST UNANIMOUSLY TO OPT IN BECAUSE IT IS AN OPT IN FOR THE PILOT COUNTIES I WOULD BE TO THEIR DAUGHTER ANGELICA ALMEIDA WHO THE DIRECTOR OF THE FORENSIC AND JUSTICE INVOLVED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AT THE SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH -- AND CAPTAIN AYE CAPTAIN KNEELS -- TANGO SORRY THANK YOU LET ME TAKE A LEVY WHO'S THE SECOND CHIEF OF THE EMMAUS OPERATION AT SAN FRANCISCO FIRE DEPARTMENT. WE WE WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND WE DO HAVE A SECOND FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING CHAIR SENATE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS DOCTOR ANGELIC HELL MADE AND I'M THE DIRECTOR FRIENDS AGAIN JUST AS INVOLVED BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO. INCLUDING PROGRAMS SUCH AS ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT AND COORDINATION FOR LPS CONSERVATORSHIP. ON BEHALF OF MAYOR BREED AND THE SITTING COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR HEARING THIS BILL AND I WANT TO THANK SENATOR SCOTT WIENER FOR ITS CONTINUED SUPPORT AND LEADERSHIP IN CALLING ATTENTION TO THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. WE ARE STRUGGLING WITH A MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE CRISIS ON OUR STREETS AND ACROSS OUR STATE AND COUNTRY. AND THERE ARE MANY INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND ARE SUFFERING FROM BOTH MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE NEEDS. FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS THE REALITY IS A SAD REPEATING CYCLE WHERE PEOPLE ARE LIVING ON THE STREET. GOING IN AND OUT OF EMERGENCY ROOMS AND IN SOME CASES BEING ARRESTED OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THIS IS DAMAGING TO THEIR HEALTH AND OVERALL WELL BEING. AS A PROVIDER I CAN SURE THAT THESE ARE THE CASES I STRUGGLE ARE AN ADEQUATE TO SUPPORT AND STABILIZE THEM. LAST YEAR GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED AS BE TEN FORTY FIVE WHICH CREATES AN OPTIONAL NEW CONSERVATORSHIP. AND THE LAST NUMBER OF MONTHS AS WE STARTED TO PREPARE FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF SB TEN FORTY FIVE WE'VE IDENTIFIED A FEW AREAS OF THE BILL THAT NEED SOME MODIFICATION TO ENSURE WE CAN SERVE THE POPULATION THAT WE INTENDED TO SERVE. SB FORTY INCLUDE THOSE MODIFICATIONS REINFORCES THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF SB TEN FORTY FIVE AND OFFERS AS A WAY TO REACH IN SUPPORT OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS. IT DOES NOT EXPAND THE POPULATION OF INDIVIDUALS ELIGIBLE FOR HOUSING CONSERVATORSHIP WHICH IN SAN FRANCISCO THE NUMBER IS ESTIMATED TO BE BETWEEN FIFTY AND SEVENTY FIVE OUR CITY HAS A LONG HISTORY OF BEING INNOVATIVE AND PROVIDING COMPASSIONATE CARE AND NEITHER I AND MY COLLEAGUES OR MAYOR BREED TO TAKE. LIGHTLY THE IDEA OF LIMITING ANYONE CIVIL LIBERTIES. WE SHOULD ALWAYS TRY TO HELP PEOPLE IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE WAY IT IS OUR MORAL ETHICAL AND LEGAL OBLIGATION BUT WE MUST NOT TURN OUR BACKS ON THOSE IN NEED AND I'M HERE BECAUSE WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO MAKE A MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCE. AND WITH THIS COMMITTEE SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL FORTY WE LOOK FORWARD TO DOING JUST THAT. I WANT TO THANK CHAIR STONE AND THIS ENTIRE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT THIS WITH. THE MORNING COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS NEIL STINGER LEANING AND I'M THE EMS OPERATIONS CHIEF FOR THE SAN FRANCISCO FIRE DEPARTMENT. I IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR WAS MY HONOR TO HELP THE DEPARTMENT IN THE CITY START THE FIRST THE MS BASED OUT REACH PROGRAM. WAS CALLED THE HOME TEAM -- PARTING WITH OTHER CLINICIANS WE WENT OUT IN THE STREETS TO TRY TO CONNECT FREQUENT USERS OF THE EN MASSE TO OTHER SYSTEMS OF CARE. I WHAT QUICKLY BECAME APPARENT THAT AND IT'S STILL TRUE TODAY IS THAT FIRST SMALL SEGMENT OF THIS POPULATION. PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS HAS% GONE UNTREATED FOR TOO LONG OR WITH ADDICTION HAS DESTROYED THEIR COGNITIVE ABILITIES. NO AMOUNT OF ENGAGEMENT SERVICES AND NO OFFER OF SERVICES WOULD DO ANYTHING TO CHANGE THE SITUATION -- I REMEMBER ONE CLIENT WHO -- BECAUSE OF HIS DRINKING IS MENTAL ILLNESS EVENTUALLY HE FOUND HE WAS OUT ON THE STREETS. AND DESPITE OUR EFFORTS TO ENGAGE WITH HIM DESPITE REPEATED TRIPS THROUGH DETOX AND HUNDREDS OF TRIPS TO THE ER HE EVENTUALLY WAS FOUND FROZEN LEANING AGAINST THE POLE -- THIS GENTLEMAN WAS IN HIS EARLY THIRTIES -- ANOTHER CLIENT THAT I WOULD GO AND ENGAGE WITH A LOT -- WE SPEND HIS DAYS AGGRESSIVELY PANHANDLING AND SMOKING CRACK COCAINE UNTIL EMS WAS CALLED. WOULD FIND HIM A MAN MISSING ONE OF ITS HOLD BOB RIGHT LEG -- WOULD FIND HIM SITTING NEXT TO STE WHEELCHAIR COVERED IN FECES AND IN A PSYCHOTIC RAGE AND WE WE DO THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN -- TODAY WITH CODIFY THOSE EARLY EFFORTS -- IN THE FORM OF COMMUNITY PARAMEDICS WE HAVE NOW -- AND PILOTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE CHALLENGE FACED BY THESE CARE GIVERS THAT MIGHT MY COLLEAGUES ARE MAGNIFIED TODAY BY THIS GROWING OPIOID IN METHAMPHETAMINE CRISIS WE SEE ALL AROUND THE NATION -- SOME OF OUR CLIENTS HAVE UTILIZED NINE ONE TWO TO THREE HUNDRED TIMES IN A SINGLE YEAR -- ONE CLIENT WE HAD A DIABETIC WHO IS ALSO A METHAMPHETAMINE USER WHO INTERACTED WITH FREQUENTLY HAD BEEN TRANSPORTED NEARLY A HUNDRED TIMES IN THE FEW MONTHS BEFORE HE DIED IN ONE OF OUR YARDS. SO WE DESPERATELY NEED SB TEN FORTY FIVE IN SB FORTY AS A MEANS OF STOPPING THIS TRAGIC AND UNNECESSARY DEATHS ON THE STREETS. YEAH PLEASE HELP OUR COMMUNITY PARAMEDICS AS THEY GO OUT THERE IN THE FIELD TO DO THIS WORK FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND AND CONSIDERATION FOR SB. FORTY THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. COME FOR GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE -- MISTER CHAMBERS MATTHEW SO I REALLY ONLY HAVE THE LOS ANGELES POLICE PROTECTIVE LEAGUE COMMAND THE CENTER FOR HIS HARD WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND HE'S. YOU KNOW APPROPRIATELY DESCRIBE THIS IS A CRISIS ME TO ASK THIS BILL THE PAST THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RANDALL HAGER FOR THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. IN A SECOND SALAS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TRAVEL ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. NICOLE WATERMAN ON BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE THEIR OPPOSITION MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CURTAILED DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. I JUST WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE VERY THOROUGH YOU. ANALYSIS THAT THEY DID -- BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY I THINK QUE IN DOING THE ANALYSIS REALLY SORTED THROUGH I THINK SOME OF THE KEY ISSUES THAT WERE BLATANTLY PROBLEMATIC WITH THE SB FORTY AND WITH THE AMENDMENTS -- I THINK WE DO AGREE THAT THAT HAS MADE -- IT THE BILL LESS PROBLEMATIC THAN IT HAS -- IN THE PAST -- IT IN AS YOU NOTE THAT A COUPLE KEY PIECES FOR US IS HE DID SHORTEN -- THE LENGTH OF THE TEMPORARY -- CONSERVATORSHIP -- IT DOES INCLUDE NOW MORE NOTICES TO INDIVIDUALS AT THE TIME OF FIFTY ONE FIFTIES -- TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO KNOW THAT. AT THE END OF THESE -- EIGHT SHOULD THAT -- ULTIMATELY HAPPEN THAT TO A CONSERVATORSHIP WOULD RESULT -- AND I THINK CRITICALLY WOOD IS IMPORTANT IS INDEED A THOROUGH EVALUATION WOULD NOW TAKE PLACE UNDER THIS BILL UP FRONT -- THAT WASN'T HAPPENING BEFORE WE CERTAINLY KNOW FIFTY ONE FIFTIES ARE NOT A THOROUGH EVALUATION THAT THAT IS A PERSON YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY GETTING TOUCHED ON THE STREET PRIDE AND FOR SEVENTY TWO HOURS THIS PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY -- FOR BUT WE THINK TO THE IMPORTANT AT AND NEEDED -- CHANCE FOR THE EVALUATION -- AND WE ALSO THINK THAT THE OPPORTUNITY AND IT'S VERY PLEASED TO HEAR -- CENTER WINNING SAY ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF VOLUNTARY TREATMENT AND SO THAT -- ROOT REQUIRING NOW THE COUNTY TO INDEED OFFER VOLUNTARY TREATMENT -- BEFORE EACH DETENTION AFTER THE THIRD FIFTY ONE FIFTY IS -- IS GOING TO BE -- CRITICAL -- AND WE ALSO ARE VERY -- PLEASED TO SEE THAT THERE IS A COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION -- AT THE END OF THE PILOT AND I THINK THAT WILL PROVIDE SOME SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION -- ON OUTCOMES -- OF SUCH A NEW PROPOSAL THAT -- WE THINK LIMITS ON THE LIBERTIES OF OF INDIVIDUALS BUT WITH ALL OF THAT BEING SAID WE DO REMAIN -- OPPOSED TO THE TO THE BILL AND AND FOR THE REASONS THAT WE HAVE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT THE THE BILL. LIKE TEN FORTY FIVE DOES TAKE AWAY INDIVIDUAL FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES THAT FOLKS HAVE NOW UNDER -- THE CURRENT LAW WHICH I THINK -- HAS QUITE FAIRLY ADEQUATELY BALANCED IMPORTANT CRITICAL FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS WITH A NEED -- FOR CARE -- FOR FOR DECADES AND WE'D SUGGEST THAT THIS BILL DOESN'T HAVE -- THAT BALANCE -- THE THE OTHER -- ITEM THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THERE'S REALLY NO LIMITATION ON THE POTENTIAL NUMBER OF PERSONS THAT. ARE POTENTIALLY SUBJECT TO TO THIS IT'S BEEN -- IN OUR OPINION MOSTLY GAS ALONG THE WAY GUESS GUESSES -- ALONG THE WAY ON WHAT THAT NUMBER WOULD BE IT STARTED OFF -- LOWER -- I THINK IS HEARING THE NUMBER NOW 527-5 AND WE'VE HEARD THE NUMBER -- FROM -- FROM ADVOCATES -- IN SAN FRANCISCO IN THIS THAT -- COULD POTENTIALLY BE -- A HUNDRED OR MORE BUT WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER HOW MANY -- THAT COULD -- POTENTIALLY -- BE -- ALSO -- WHAT WE'D HAVE ADVOCATED THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS AND TEN FORTY FIVE AND IN THIS BILL -- IS WELL IS THERE ARE NO RESOURCES -- THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING THERE IS NO RESOURCES -- FOR ADDITIONAL SERVICES THAT ARE GUARANTEED BY -- THIS BILL -- AND I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE CONTINUES TO REPORT ON WHAT THEY HAVE SEEN AS A BROKEN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM IN THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS RIGHT NOW. OF RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES FOR INDIVIDUALS WE THINK THAT THAT ULTIMATELY MEANS THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL -- BE BRIAN AND CONSERVED UNDER THIS NEW PROVISION ARE GOING TO END UP IN THE INSTITUTIONS AND POTENTIALLY LOCKED INSTITUTIONS FOR A FOR THE CHARACTER SO AGAIN WE BELIEVE THAT THE ANSWER IS -- PROVIDING FIX SUPPORTIVE SERVICES UP FRONT THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO TRY THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO TEST THOSE NEED TO BE. SUPPORTIVE HOUSING THEY NEED TO BE TREATMENT -- AND SERVICES ALL OFFERED IN THE COMMUNITY AND NOT IN INSTITUTIONS AND SO FOR THAT REASON WE ARE CHORE -- NO VOTE. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE GOOD MORNING CHEN FLOOR ON BEHALF OF WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- I AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE AT DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA -- FOR WESTERN CENTER THE INITIAL BILL SB TEN FORTY FIVE AND SB FORTY ARE STILL VERY MUCH FOCUSED ON STATUS RATHER THAN CONDITION WHETHER IT WAS THE ORIGINAL THIS IS A HOMELESS CONSERVATORSHIP OR IT'S YOU KNOW NOW BASED ON HISTORY OF ARRESTOR FIFTY ONE FIFTIES -- IT'S REALLY BASED ON SOMEBODY STATUS AT IN CALIFORNIA THE HISTORY OF THE IMPACT OF CONFINEMENT IS NOT GOOD WHETHER IT'S IN PRISONS OR IT CONFINED IN HOSPITALS WE TEND TO CONFINE POOR PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF COLOR -- AND WE ALSO REMAIN YOU KNOW CONCERNED ABOUT THE REMOVAL OF A TIAS REQUIREMENTS. THAT SAID I WOULD YOU KNOW I DO AGREE WITH THAT SENATOR -- THERE IS A CRISIS OUR ANSWER TO THE CRISIS IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE HOUSING FIRST WITH FULL OF WRAPAROUND SERVICES AS NECESSARY. THAT SAID I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR AMENDS WE BELIEVE THAT THE ADDITIONAL -- DUE PROCESS REQUIREMENTS MAY ACTUALLY HELP MORE PEOPLE GET THE SERVICES THAT THEY SHOULD BE GETTING -- AND WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THAT'S THE CASE AND FINALLY WE THINK THAT THE EVALUATION PIECE THAT WAS ADDED IS CRITICAL -- AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WE OFTEN HAVE A DISPARATE IMPACT WHEN IT COMES TO CONFINEMENT SO WE'RE GLAD THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY TRACK AND LOOK AT THAT -- AS WELL AS DETERMINE WHETHER THE CONSERVATORSHIP SAYS PLANNED ARE WORKING OUT AS INTENDED NONE THE LESS AS I MENTIONED WE REMAIN OPPOSED AND I REQUEST YOU KNOW ABOUT. THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION IF YOU GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE TURN MEMBERS KEVIN BANK OF AMERICA THE CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF CALIFORNIA WITH RESPECT AND APPRECIATION FOR THE COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHOR. WE NEVER LEFT FOR ME TO POST THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS WERE NAY BAYARDO AS HE ARE YOU CALIFORNIA WE APPRECIATE AMENDMENTS AS WELL THERE'S A LOT OF PROGRESS NEVER WE REMAIN OPPOSED. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SIGNAL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. THIS RACE THE MISTER KALRA. THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT OF BILLS THAT. THE WE HAVE. TO BUT I HAVE TO VOTE ON BECAUSE THE OPPOSITION THESE ARE THE THESE ARE THE VERY ORGANIZATIONS THAT I AM ALWAYS AND AGREE WITH AN AGREEMENT WITH. I APPRECIATE THAT SENATOR WINNER THAT YEAR THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL -- BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU'RE COMMITTED TO THIS AS WELL AND YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND. THE THE SOLUTIONS TO SOMETHING THAT THAT EVERYBODY AGREES IS A CRISIS WE ARE AT THE END OF IT TO PUT IN A POINT NOW WHERE SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE. AND ALTHOUGH IT EVERY TIME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TAKING AWAY THE CIVIL LIBERTIES OF ANY HUMAN BEING WE'VE GOT TO TREAD LIGHTLY WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE DUE PROCESS IS THERE. AND I TO APPRECIATE THE VALUATION PIECE AND I THINK THAT THAT IS GOING TO LEAD TO MORE SERVICES BEING PROVIDED BEFORE THE NEXT STEP IS TAKEN -- I I APPRECIATE ALSO THE YOUR COMMENT ABOUT USING THIS AS A TOOL. OF LAST RESORT -- AND DID MAKING SURE THAT WE HELP PEOPLE. IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE WAY -- IT IT IS A DIFFICULT ONE I I AM WITH YOU THOUGH I DO THINK THAT WHEN WE HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING WE ALSO -- WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO THOSE WHO ARE MOST IN NEED AND ARE ABLE. TO FIND HOW. TO TO TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES. BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE DUE PROCESS IS THERE AND THAT WE PROTECT THEM FROM. THOSE OVER ZEALOUS -- PEOPLE WHO SIMPLY WANT THEM OFF THE STREETS AND WANT THEM PUT AWAY -- WITHOUT HAVING TO DEAL WITH THEM AGAIN. BUT TO TO FIND A WAY. TO TO TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. IT'S THIS IS THIS IS A TOUGH. ONE BUT I APPRECIATE. COMMENTS FROM THE OPPOSITION BECAUSE I THINK IT MADE THIS BILL A LOT BETTER -- WITH MORE PROTECTIONS -- THANK YOU. THANK YOU THIS CAR. YEAH I AM. I JOIN UP WITH MY COLLEAGUE IN -- THIS IS A DIFFICULT I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY FOR YOU CENTER WIENER BECAUSE IT IS I KNOW WHERE YOUR COMPASSION YOUR SENSIBILITIES LIE -- BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND -- IT WILL BE WE HAVE A CRISIS IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. AND I THINK ALL OF US AGREE THAT WE NEED MORE SUPPORT OF HOUSING AND THAT'S SOMETHING YOU I AND I THINK MANY OF US UP HERE SUPPORTED. AS WELL -- AND END IN ON AND AND FRANKLY. YOU KNOW IN MY PAST LIFE I HAVE CLIENTS THAT I PROBABLY WISH I COULD OF CONSERVED BUT I'M GLAD I DIDN'T HAVE THE POWER TO THE GOVERNMENT DIDN'T HAVE THE POWER TO SO IT'S IT'S IT'S A REALLY -- I THINK THAT THE FACT AND I THINK THAT THE OPPOSITION INDICATES THE THE AMENDMENT CERTAINLY MAKE IT A BETTER BILL FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A DUE PROCESS AND THAT THE PERSPECTIVE. OF ENSURING THAT TO THE THE SCOPE IS LIMITED -- BUT BY THE GOVERNMENT -- BUT ULTIMATELY IT IS THE GOVERNMENT THAT WERE GIVEN THE ABILITY -- TO TAKE A LIBERTIES AWAY AND I YOU KNOW. I I KNOW THAT -- IT IN I THINK THE OFTENTIMES -- BUT WITH BILLS LIKE THIS WERE CLEARLY I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE A LOT OF PAIN. THAT -- CAN ASK FOR HELP AND NEED HELP -- AND SO THE INTENTIONS -- I BELIEVE ARE A YOU SENATOR -- IT'S UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SPECIALNESS POLITICAL PRESSURE. AND MANY OF THESE JURISDICTIONS TO KIND OF CLEAR THE STREETS. TO BEAUTIFY GET RID OF THE WHOLE BLIGHT. THAT'S WHERE I GET WORRIED THAT'S WHY THESE CHECKS AND BALANCES IN THE REVIEWS AND THAT THE DATA COLLECTION ON DEMOGRAPHICS ARE ALL GOING TO BE CRITICAL IN AND I REALLY LOOK AT THIS -- AS A TRUE PILOT I I KNOW THAT OFTENTIMES PILOTS ARE PUT IN PLACE AND THEN IT GETS TO THE END OKAY LET'S MAKE A PERMANENT NOW -- YOU KNOW I THINK MANY OF US -- WILL LIKELY STILL BE HERE. WHEN WHEN THE WHEN THE PILOT? A COMES TO A CONCLUSION. AND I'LL BE -- IF IF MY SUPPORT CONTINUES FOR THE BILL AT THE I'M I'M DROPPING IN THE BE LOOKING VERY CAREFULLY -- AT THE DATA AND I KNOW THE OPPOSITION ON I KNOW YOU WILL AS WELL A CENTER -- AND I THINK THAT TO REALLY SEE IT HAS THE DESIRED OUTCOME OF ACTUALLY HELPING. THOSE -- THAT OUR CONCERT AND NOT JUST SIMPLY WAREHOUSING PEOPLE AND GETTING THEM OUT OF SIGHT OUT OF MIND. BECAUSE THAT'S ALWAYS THE WORRY WHENEVER THERE'S WELL INTENTIONED BILLS AND IN THE HISTORY WE HAVE. IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN THIS NATION IS IS NOT A GOOD -- ONE BUT AGAIN GIVEN THE FACT THAT. SPEARHEADING IT GIVES ME SOME SENSE OF COMFORT -- AND THE FACT THAT IT'S AN THREE JURISDICTIONS AND CAN BE MONITORED AS SUCH -- INTO ANIMAL IN A MORE NARROW SCOPE AS OPPOSED TO A STATEWIDE PILOT -- AND THREE JURISDICTIONS I KNOW THAT HAVE BEEN. FACING A LOT OF ISSUES IN TERMS OF CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS AND AND ISSUES OF OF OF IT IN IN THEIR COMMUNITIES -- BUT I WAS AS A STATE OF BY -- BY OPPOSITION YOU KNOW THAT THE THE THE STATUS OF OTHER THE HOMELESS OR OF BEING AN INCONVENIENCE OR ALONE -- CANNOT BE THE JUSTIFICATION TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS TYPE OF ACTION SO -- AGAIN I'LL I'LL REPEAT THAT OF ITEMS IN SUPPORT OF THE COMMENTS FROM OPPOSITION THAT. THE AMENDMENTS I THINK DEFINITELY MAKE IT A BETTER BILL -- AND I HONESTLY LOOK FORWARD TO THE FEEDBACK WE GET BACK AND IN THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS TO SEE -- IF IT PASSES BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S URGENCY BECAUSE WHAT YEAH THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THERE BUT CERTAINLY IF IT IS ABLE TO GET PASSING IT SIGNED INTO LAW. WE'LL BE LOOKING VERY CLOSELY IN AND I KNOW MY COLLEAGUES A SAM CISCO IN THESE OTHER JURISDICTIONS LA SAN DIEGO WILL ALSO BE LOOKING VERY CLOSELY SO I HAVE SOME SENSE OF COMFORT OF OF FOLKS THAT. I LINE WITH VERY MUCH IDEOLOGICALLY THEY'RE ALWAYS GOING TO BE PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE CIVIL LIBERTY ISSUES HERE SO THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] YES MAIENSCHEIN. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN I RAN OVER HERE TO IT BECAUSE I I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU AND AND GIVE SOME KUDOS THE AUTHOR THIS IS THIS IS A REALLY -- DIFFICULT SUBJECT WHEN I WAS AT THE HOMELESS MEASURE FOR SAN DIEGO. AND WORKING WITH -- THE THE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS A SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL IS FINDING THAT BALANCE BECAUSE WE HAD THESE ISSUES WHERE -- THE LEGAL REMEDIES STEP TO TO BEGIN TO HELP SOME THESE TWO AND WAS IT WASN'T JUST THE HOMELESS IT WAS ALMOST PROVIDERS TO BUT PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN LONG TERM HOMELESS. NO WHAT DO YOU DO TO BEGIN TO HELP THEM -- AND WHAT SORT OF DEFINES WHAT IS BEING HUMANE. YOU KNOW AT SOME POINT IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IN MY VIEW IT'S NOT HUMANE TO LET'S TO HAVE TO NOT HAVE -- PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO SOMEBODY WHO HAS. CLEARLY -- SHOWN PARTICULAR THROUGH MENTAL ILLNESS AND AN ABILITY TO CARE FOR THEMSELVES AND ABILITY TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT WOULD. IMPROVE THEIR LOT AND SO -- I UNDERSTAND THIS IS A SENSITIVE LEGAL ISSUE. BUT I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY THE GOOD -- TREMENDOUSLY OUTWEIGHS THE BAD AND IT'S A WAY TO START -- WRAPPING HER ARMS AROUND AND HELPING IT. WITHOUT QUESTION THE MOST VULNERABLE OF ANIMALS SO THANK YOU FOR TACKLING THIS UNIT HAD DISCUSSIONS ON THIS -- YOU KNOW FOR MANY YEARS WHY AFFECT MY FIRST MET THIS IS THE TOPIC THAT REALLY KIND OF CAME UP AND SO. I THANK YOU FOR TACKLING IT IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT I'M I'M PLEASED TO SUPPORT IT TODAY AND I THINK IT'LL GO. A LONG WAY TOWARDS HELPING SOME OF OUR SEEMINGLY INTRACTABLE PROBLEMS [inaudible] THIS GALLAGHER. YES SUPPORTED YOUR BILL LAST YEAR AND I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY YES I THINK THAT THE BOTTOM LINE IS. WE CAN'T JUST KEEP DOING THE SAME OLD THING AND EXPECTING DIFFERENT RESULTS WE HAVE TO TRY SOME DIFFERENT THINGS AND I THINK THIS THIS PILOT PROGRAM IN ENSURING THAT IT CAN BE EFFECTIVE -- BY DOING THESE CHANGES TODAY. YOU ARE OUR BY THE DIRECTION WE NEED TO MOVE IN AND I THINK IT'S BEEN STATED BY OTHERS TODAY THAT. MANY OF THESE ISSUES UNLESS YOU YOU KNOW. TRULY DEAL WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH OR DRUG ADDICTION ISSUE. THAT PERSON IS GOING TO CONTINUE BE BACK ON THE STREETS. THERE IS NO EASY ANSWERS. CERTAINLY IN DEALING WITH -- YOU KNOW THE HOMELESS CRISIS THAT WE HAVE IN IN THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS THAT WE HAVE -- BUT I THINK THIS IS A A TOOL THAT I LIKE TO SEE HOW IT WORKS IN THESE IN THESE COUNTIES IN. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT IT'S THAT IS SUCCESSFUL -- LOOK AT HOW WE CAN EXPAND THAT OUT. SO CHANGE SHOULD THE AUTHOR AND I WILL BE SUPPORT IN THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU IT'S A TWO I'M A VERY BRIEF FIVE BECAUSE I THINK MANY OF THE SENTIMENTS THAT I SHARE OF ALREADY BEEN -- HAVE ALREADY BEEN DELINEATED BUT I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR -- FOR FOR MOVING THIS FOR I THINK YOU AND THIS BILL ARE OFTEN MISINTERPRETED AND MISUNDERSTOOD -- BUT THE REALITY IS AND TOO MANY OF OUR STREETS AND CERTAINLY AND THE CITY THAT YOU AND I SHARE REPRESENTING -- WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LITERALLY IN TREMENDOUS RESTAURANT IS HARMON ARE DYING ON OUR STREETS AND WE HAVE TO DO MORE WE HAVE TO THINK DIFFERENTLY. AND I HAPPEN TO BE ONE WHO THINKS IT IS PROGRESSIVE FOR US AS A STATE. TO PROVIDE THE HELP THAT THEY NEED TO DO IT IN A VERY CAREFULLY SCULPTED WAY WHICH I BELIEVE THIS BILL IS -- AND TO DO WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE DO IN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WE SPEND -- TO TO ADDRESS THIS NEED SO -- CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE OPPOSITION AND I KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR HAS IT'S NOT HARD AND HOW TO INCORPORATE -- THE VALID FEEDBACK -- BUT WITH THAT -- LOOK FOR TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT CONCERNS ME IS WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT DETAINING PEOPLE FOR THEIR OWN GOOD BECAUSE OFTEN THE CONVERSATION ENDS THERE. AND IF THAT'S ALL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT IT BECOMES TO TENSIONS ROOF KIND OF THE CONVENIENCE OF OF OTHERS RATHER THAN SOMETHING THAT THAT. REALLY IS TRYING TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING PROBLEMS THAT THAT ARE THERE. AND THAT'S WHY FOR THIS COMMITTEE. I REALLY PUSHED BACK IN AND THE HAD STAFF PUSHED BACK TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PUTTING SOME APPROPRIATE BOUNDS AROUND THIS INCLUDING THE DATA COLLECTION. BECAUSE SENSE. YOUR LAST BILL PASSED ACTUALLY BEEN APPROACHED BY A NUMBER OF COUNTIES WHO WANT TO PARTAKE IN THIS AND I FOR ONE AM UNWILLING TO DO THAT AND I THINK WE SHOULD BE VERY CAUTIOUS. IN EXPANDING THIS PILOT UNTIL WE GET SOME REAL DATA IN ABOUT. WHO'S BEING SERVED HOW THEY'RE BEING SERVED WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE INDIVIDUALS. AND COUNTIES WITHOUT THE SAME RESOURCES OR WITHOUT THE SAME COMMITMENT. TO REALLY RESOLVING SOME OF THE ISSUES COULD USE THESE TOOLS IN A WAY THAT I THINK A LOT OF US MIGHT FIND AN APPROPRIATE. AND REALLY MORE TOWARDS THE DETENTION FOR THE SAKE OF DETENTION. AS OPPOSED TO A STRUCTURE THAT THAT. REALLY ADDRESSES THE MOST DIFFICULT INDIVIDUALS TO SERVE. AND SERVICE THEM. IN AN APPROPRIATE WAY. SO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF THE BALANCE WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO STRIKE AND AND MAKE SURE THAT. WE ARE REALLY ADDRESSING THE UNDERLYING NEEDS AND IF WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE PROCESS WE BEING STATE CALIFORNIA AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS GOING TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF DETAINING SOMEONE. THEN WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. FIFTY ONE FIFTIES PRETTY LOW STANDARD YES EIGHT OF THEM ARE A LOT. BUT FIFTY ONE FIFTIES OFTEN GET USED AGAIN AND AGAIN WHAT WE WOULD HATE TO SEE A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE SOMEBODY HAS SEVERAL FIFTY ONE FIFTIES AND THEN IT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AS WELL IF WE JUST DO A COUPLE MORE. WE CAN THEN DETAIN THAT WE CAN DO OTHER THINGS FOR THEM. THAT'S NOT THE REASON FOR THE FIFTY ONE FIFTIES IN FACT THERE'S A FIFTY TO FIFTY SECTION WHICH REQUIRES A LOT MORE. OF A MENTAL HEALTH ANALYSIS OF AN INDIVIDUAL THAT'S WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO PUSH THIS MORE TOWARDS THAT SO THAT. THERE ARE [inaudible] OFTEN. IT MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE OFTEN GO HAND IN HAND BUT NOT ALWAYS SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE ARE APPLYING THE RATE. REMEDIES TO THE SITUATION AGAIN RATHER THAN JUST SWEEPING PEOPLE UP FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF OF THE LOCAL JURISDICTION. MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM CALIFORNIA'S NOT REALLY FUNCTIONING THAT WELL WE KNOW THAT IT'S BEEN BROKEN FOR A LONG TIME LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH THAT. THE FACT THAT. COUNTIES AND EVEN THE STATOR SITTING ON SO MUCH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT MONEY WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO SPEND IT. THAT SHOULD THAT SHOULD BE AN ALARM BELL TO US THAT THAT IT'S NOT WORKING BECAUSE THERE IS MONEY TO BE ABLE TO BE APPLIED IT JUST. ISN'T AND I THINK THAT. THE STATE HAS A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY THERE BECAUSE IT HAS NOT BEEN SUPPORTING COUNTIES IN GETTING THAT'S MONEY SPENT OR BEEN WILLING TO GET MONEY SPENT WHICH WOULD REALLY HELP. DEALING WITH SOME OF THESE EXACT POPULATIONS. BUT IT'S BEEN FRACTURED FOR A LONG TIME ESPECIALLY GO BACK TO THE TIME WHEN WE CLOSED. STATE CLOSED -- MENTAL HEALTH FACILITIES WITHOUT ANY. REPLACEMENT WITHOUT ANY FOLLOW UP OR ABILITY TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITIES AND WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT. BUT A HEALTH BETS JUVENILE ADULT MEN HEALTH AS WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE PUT THOSE RESOURCES BACK IN OUR COMMUNITIES TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE MOST. CHRONIC. CASES THAT THAT WE SEE IN OUR COMMUNITIES SO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF OF THE SENSITIVITY AND CENTER UNIT. THAT CONVERSATION. SO AS THIS MOVES FORWARD. THEY WITH THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD NEED TO TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO SAY OKAY WE'VE ALLOWED THIS TO MOVE FORWARD WE HAVE TO BE HOLDING. SERVICES GO AND THE TEEN DIEGO LA SHOULD THEY CHOOSE TO ADOPT THIS ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT HAPPENS FOR THE NUMBERS. BECAUSE AS A PILOT AS MISTER KALRA SAYS. IT'S GONNA BE VERY TEMPTING FOR OTHER JURISDICTIONS THEY'LL LET US JUMP IN LATEST BUT ISSUES THIS AS WELL. AND WHAT WE NEED TO LEARN FROM THIS PILOT FROM THE DATA COLLECTION IS WHAT WORKED WHAT DIDN'T WORK. SO THAT WE CAN FOR NARROW ITS ITS USE OVER TIME IN A WAY THAT'S MOST APPROPRIATE MOST EFFECTIVE AND ANY JURISDICTION THAT WANTS TO STEP IN. IS GOING TO HAVE TO PUT SOME RESOURCES ON THE TABLE WHICH I KNOW SAM CISCO WELL. BECAUSE THEY HAVE YOU HAVE. PUT A LOT OF RESOURCES IN TO TRY AND MANAGE POPULATIONS THAT'S REALLY THE BALLOTS WERE TRYING TO FIGHT HERE SO I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS. TO TALK THROUGH THIS I KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE SENSITIVE TO THESE SAME ISSUES AND WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT WILL BE. SUCCESSFUL IN TERMS OF SCOPE NOT JUST FOR THE CITY BUT FOR THE PEOPLE INVOLVED AND THAT'S THANK YOU SENATOR AND WITH THAT YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU CARDS FOR THE THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS -- HIGH -- IN TERMS OF FIVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- RACIST COMMENTS IT IS AWKWARD BECAUSE I AUTHOR SPONSORED BILLS FOR THE WESTERN CENTER AND THE ACLU MULTIPLE ONES EVERY YEAR THESE OUR ALLIES PEOPLE ON THE LINE WITH. ON ON EVERYTHING BUT YOU KNOW ONCE IN AWHILE YOU HAVE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AND THE OPPONENTS THIS BILL I I DON'T CRITICIZE THEM AT ALL THEY ARE. YOU KNOW THERE ARE. PLAYING A VERY CRITICAL ROLE AND SO I RESPECT WHERE THERE ARE COMING FROM THAT I'M GLAD THAT WE WILL LEAST BEEN ABLE TO CLOSE THE GAP TO SOMEWHAT. ON AND I AGREE THAT HOUSING FIRST IS HELPING IS KEY TO EVERYTHING BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE -- NEED TO TRANSITION AND THE HOUSING AND NEED SOME HELP TO GET STABLE ENOUGH SO THAT THEIR SUCCESSFUL -- IN THAT -- IN THAT HOUSING AND IS TO BE VERY CLEAR -- AS SOMEONE SAID TO ME RECENTLY WE CURRENTLY HAVE. A CONSERVATORSHIP SYSTEM BUT AT THE CAN A SYSTEM THAT IS A COMBINATION OF CYCLING PEOPLE TO FIFTY ONE FIFTIES WHERE THEY DO NOT GET THE EVALUATIONS THAT THEY NEED. CYCLING PEOPLE TO JAIL. AND THEN IN BETWEEN THEY'RE OUT ON THE STREETS. RATING THAT'S THE SORT OF CONSERVATORSHIP QUOTE ON QUOTE THAT IS WHAT WE'RE AND THE LAST THING WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE CONSTANTLY HAVING CONTACT WITH THE POLICE -- AND CONSTANTLY CYCLING THROUGH JAIL AND MORE MORE FOR THE ONE FIFTIES LET'S GET THESE FOLKS STABLE AND HEALTHY AND ON WITH THEIR LIVES AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IDOL.
