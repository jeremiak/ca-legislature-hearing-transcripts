APPROPRIATE OR. OF SOMEONE WHO'S

00:37:04.022 --> 00:37:07.559 region:rollup2
GOT A RECORD OF.

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:08.126 region:rollup2
IT'S SORT OF BLOWING OFF

00:37:07.559 --> 00:37:09.794 region:rollup2
DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS THAT

00:37:08.126 --> 00:37:10.128 region:rollup2
THERE.

00:37:09.794 --> 00:37:12.163 region:rollup2
UNDER THE LAW.

00:37:10.128 --> 00:37:13.832 region:rollup2
.

00:37:12.163 --> 00:37:15.567 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THE BUREAU REAL SAY

00:37:13.832 --> 00:37:17.702 region:rollup2
AYE I MAY BE WRONG BUT I'D LIKE

00:37:15.567 --> 00:37:18.503 region:rollup2
TO HEAR FROM ME BOTH SIDES ABOUT

00:37:17.702 --> 00:37:19.771 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S ACCURATE I THINK TO

00:37:18.503 --> 00:37:21.506 region:rollup2
BE A REAL REAL SAID ALREADY HAS

00:37:19.771 --> 00:37:22.273 region:rollup2
THE POWER TO DO THAT.

00:37:21.506 --> 00:37:24.642 region:rollup2
AND SO I'M WONDERING IF THE

00:37:22.273 --> 00:37:25.677 region:rollup2
SECTION DE IS.

00:37:24.642 --> 00:37:26.277 region:rollup2
EVERY GUY GETS CONCERT TAKEN OUT

00:37:25.677 --> 00:37:28.446 region:rollup2
OF THE BILL.

00:37:26.277 --> 00:37:30.281 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS LIKE.

00:37:28.446 --> 00:37:32.283 region:rollup2
FORFEITURE OF LICENSE FOR.

00:37:30.281 --> 00:37:33.818 region:rollup2
AN INADVERTENCE NONDISCLOSURE OR

00:37:32.283 --> 00:37:34.319 region:rollup2
A FIRST TIME OFFENSE JUST

00:37:33.818 --> 00:37:35.520 region:rollup2
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE

00:37:34.319 --> 00:37:36.855 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE. PENALTY TO MAKE.

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.957 region:rollup2
AND

00:37:36.855 --> 00:37:40.258 region:rollup2
AT SUCH AS THE.

00:37:38.957 --> 00:37:42.160 region:rollup2
ON A THREAT OUT THERE I AGREE

00:37:40.258 --> 00:37:43.595 region:rollup2
AND I THINK PART.

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:45.196 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY JUST RESTATED WHAT THE

00:37:43.595 --> 00:37:46.998 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE PENALTY WOULD BE

00:37:45.196 --> 00:37:48.466 region:rollup2
SO OKAY WE CAN CROSS REFERENCE

00:37:46.998 --> 00:37:50.668 region:rollup2
IT THAT'S BETTER.

00:37:48.466 --> 00:37:52.070 region:rollup2
SO OKAY SO THE INTENT IS IT'S

00:37:50.668 --> 00:37:53.271 region:rollup2
NOT ADDING THAT DO NOT HAVE

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:54.973 region:rollup2
EIGHTY NINE IT NOW OBVIOUSLY

00:37:53.271 --> 00:37:55.473 region:rollup2
THAT'S UP TO TO YOU KNOW IN A

00:37:54.973 --> 00:37:56.808 region:rollup2
DEGREE JUST CASE BECAUSE

00:37:55.473 --> 00:37:58.276 region:rollup2
THERE'S.

00:37:56.808 --> 00:38:00.111 region:rollup2
OTHER FACTORS IT'S NOT ENOUGH

00:37:58.276 --> 00:38:02.147 region:rollup2
FOR ME TO DECIDE BUT I I AGREE

00:38:00.111 --> 00:38:04.015 region:rollup2
WITH YOU ANNA. IN A CASE IT'S

00:38:02.147 --> 00:38:04.749 region:rollup2
INCIDENTAL THAT'S NOT WHAT WAS

00:38:04.015 --> 00:38:07.018 region:rollup2
INTENDED.

00:38:04.749 --> 00:38:07.619 region:rollup2
OKAY.

00:38:07.018 --> 00:38:09.821 region:rollup2
AND THEN MY OTHER QUESTION WAS

00:38:07.619 --> 00:38:10.789 region:rollup2
JUST.

00:38:09.821 --> 00:38:11.789 region:rollup2
IT THIS IS JUST FOR A COMMERCIAL

00:38:10.789 --> 00:38:14.959 region:rollup2
RIGHT YES.

00:38:11.789 --> 00:38:16.361 region:rollup2
OKAY I.

00:38:14.959 --> 00:38:17.529 region:rollup2
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT SEEMS LIKE

00:38:16.361 --> 00:38:18.763 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM WOULD BE MORE ACUTE

00:38:17.529 --> 00:38:20.532 region:rollup2
IN THE ON THE RESIDENTIAL SIDE

00:38:18.763 --> 00:38:22.433 region:rollup2
IN THE COMMERCIAL IS BECAUSE.

00:38:20.532 --> 00:38:23.835 region:rollup2
THE TYPES OF PEOPLE TO GET INTO

00:38:22.433 --> 00:38:26.471 region:rollup2
THOSE TRANSACTIONS I MEAN MAYBE

00:38:23.835 --> 00:38:27.739 region:rollup2
I'M WRONG BUT. JUST CURIOUS WHY

00:38:26.471 --> 00:38:28.940 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T DEFINITELY IS PROBABLY

00:38:27.739 --> 00:38:30.375 region:rollup2
GONNA WILL. FOR THE PROMISE

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:31.609 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL YOU'RE DEALING WITH

00:38:30.375 --> 00:38:34.012 region:rollup2
IT INSTITUTION MULTIBILLION

00:38:31.609 --> 00:38:34.546 region:rollup2
DOLLAR INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE

00:38:34.012 --> 00:38:36.181 region:rollup2
REPRESENTED THIS IS THEIR

00:38:34.546 --> 00:38:37.282 region:rollup2
PROFESSION.

00:38:36.181 --> 00:38:38.883 region:rollup2
HEY THERE THEY MIGHT HAVE FOR

00:38:37.282 --> 00:38:40.218 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE CBRE. EITHER OWNS OR

00:38:38.883 --> 00:38:41.753 region:rollup2
CONTROLS TWO POINT FIVE BILLION

00:38:40.218 --> 00:38:43.054 region:rollup2
SQUARE FEET OF COMMERCIAL SPACE

00:38:41.753 --> 00:38:44.823 region:rollup2
THAT'S EQUAL TO EVERY OFFICE

00:38:43.054 --> 00:38:46.357 region:rollup2
BUILDING ON THE WHOLE WESTERN

00:38:44.823 --> 00:38:48.393 region:rollup2
HALF OF THE U. S..

00:38:46.357 --> 00:38:49.561 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PROPERTY.

00:38:48.393 --> 00:38:51.062 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW A GROUP LIKE THAT IS

00:38:49.561 --> 00:38:52.430 region:rollup2
VERY VERY SOPHISTICATED WHAT

00:38:51.062 --> 00:38:55.500 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DOING AND THEY WORK

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:56.267 region:rollup2
TOGETHER. TO HELP THEIR CLIENTS

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:58.870 region:rollup2
THEIR CONSTITUENTS WHICH I

00:38:56.267 --> 00:39:00.305 region:rollup2
LANDLORDS PRIMARILY IT REPRESENT

00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:01.739 region:rollup2
A LOT OF LOT ATTENDANTS TO BUT.

00:39:00.305 --> 00:39:04.042 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THOSE ARE IN DUAL

00:39:01.739 --> 00:39:05.443 region:rollup2
AGENCY CONFLICTED ROLES.

00:39:04.042 --> 00:39:07.679 region:rollup2
WE THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

00:39:05.443 --> 00:39:09.480 region:rollup2
THAT THESE TENANTS WHO CAN BE.

00:39:07.679 --> 00:39:11.115 region:rollup2
A DRY CLEANER OR A DELI OR A

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:12.350 region:rollup2
COFFEE SHOP ALL THE WAY UP TO

00:39:11.115 --> 00:39:14.385 region:rollup2
THE LARGEST FIRMS OUT THERE.

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:14.919 region:rollup2
THEY AT LEAST BE AWARE THAT

00:39:14.385 --> 00:39:17.288 region:rollup2
THERE'S THAT POTENTIAL OF

00:39:14.919 --> 00:39:19.858 region:rollup2
CONFLICT.

00:39:17.288 --> 00:39:21.559 region:rollup2
THAT EVERYBODY'S YOU NEED IT

00:39:19.858 --> 00:39:22.827 region:rollup2
ACTING EGREGIOUSLY JUST THERE'S

00:39:21.559 --> 00:39:25.330 region:rollup2
THAT POTENTIAL IN THAT SHOULD

00:39:22.827 --> 00:39:26.531 region:rollup2
JUST BE A LITTLE BIT MORE WHERE.

00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:27.031 region:rollup2
AND SO I AGREE WITH YOUR

00:39:26.531 --> 00:39:27.832 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTION THAT THERE'S

00:39:27.031 --> 00:39:30.635 region:rollup2
PROBABLY.

00:39:27.832 --> 00:39:32.503 region:rollup2
OTHER PROBLEMS WITH A REAL

00:39:30.635 --> 00:39:33.371 region:rollup2
ESTATE AT. AT NIGHT SORRY I

00:39:32.503 --> 00:39:33.805 region:rollup2

TRANSACTION.

00:39:34.939 --> 00:39:39.110 region:rollup2
R. HOME BUYERS BAD BUT THIS IS

00:39:37.942 --> 00:39:39.978 region:rollup2
A.

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:40.712 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S ONE OF THINGS I THINK

00:39:39.978 --> 00:39:41.946 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DEALING WITH IN THESE

00:39:40.712 --> 00:39:43.715 region:rollup2
OMNIBUS BILLS THAT ARE GOING

00:39:41.946 --> 00:39:45.283 region:rollup2
THROUGH NOW THIS WAS JUST

00:39:43.715 --> 00:39:47.185 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH THE SPECIFIC ISSUE

00:39:45.283 --> 00:39:48.086 region:rollup2
WITH SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. IN

00:39:47.185 --> 00:39:50.121 region:rollup2
MY DISTRICT.

00:39:48.086 --> 00:39:51.856 region:rollup2
WHO ARE ARE IN A SITUATION

00:39:50.121 --> 00:39:53.524 region:rollup2
WHERE TO LEAST SMALL AMOUNTS OF

00:39:51.856 --> 00:39:54.392 region:rollup2
SPACE FROM YOU KNOW WE WANNA

00:39:53.524 --> 00:39:56.027 region:rollup2
JUST IN SHORT THAT THEY'RE

00:39:54.392 --> 00:39:57.595 region:rollup2
PROTECTED AND? THAT THEY HAVE AS

00:39:56.027 --> 00:39:59.464 region:rollup2
A BASIC DISCLOSURE THAT THEY CAN

00:39:57.595 --> 00:40:00.732 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND EVEN IF THEIR ENGLISH

00:39:59.464 --> 00:40:00.932 region:rollup2
SKILLS PROBABLY AREN'T. UP TO

00:40:00.732 --> 00:40:02.934 region:rollup2
PAR.

00:40:00.932 --> 00:40:03.201 region:rollup2
OKAY.

00:40:02.934 --> 00:40:04.903 region:rollup2
AND THEN.

00:40:03.201 --> 00:40:05.503 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THAT.

00:40:04.903 --> 00:40:08.239 region:rollup2
THAT MY LAST QUESTION RELATES

00:40:05.503 --> 00:40:09.574 region:rollup2
TO.

00:40:08.239 --> 00:40:11.142 region:rollup2
I I GUESS WHAT WE'RE GOING FOR

00:40:09.574 --> 00:40:12.844 region:rollup2
WITH THE TIMING AYE IS I READ

00:40:11.142 --> 00:40:15.780 region:rollup2
SECTION SEE.

00:40:12.844 --> 00:40:16.514 region:rollup2
IT SAYS AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE.

COMMENCES LICENSE ACTIVITY.

00:40:20.885 --> 00:40:26.124 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT THAT

00:40:23.554 --> 00:40:26.724 region:rollup2
MEANS BUT THAT MIGHT BE. ME NOT

00:40:26.124 --> 00:40:28.593 region:rollup2
KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT REAL

00:40:26.724 --> 00:40:30.795 region:rollup2

YOU WANT TO BE AS EARLY AS

00:40:33.031 --> 00:40:35.300 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE AND IT JUST.

DONE ONCE AND RIGHT IS

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:38.803 region:rollup2
SORT OF.

00:40:36.334 --> 00:40:40.138 region:rollup2
MY VIEW OF.

00:40:38.803 --> 00:40:41.472 region:rollup2
HOW YOU WOULD OPERATE

00:40:40.138 --> 00:40:43.007 region:rollup2
EFFICIENTLY AND THAT IS THAT

00:40:41.472 --> 00:40:44.976 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING HERE IS THAT THE

00:40:43.007 --> 00:40:46.311 region:rollup2
EARLY IN ONCE OR IS IT? LIKE A

00:40:44.976 --> 00:40:47.345 region:rollup2
DUPLICATE OF THING THAT'S GOING

00:40:46.311 --> 00:40:49.314 region:rollup2
TO BE DONE AT VARIOUS.

00:40:47.345 --> 00:40:51.082 region:rollup2
TIMES OF PEOPLE MIGHT GET.

00:40:49.314 --> 00:40:53.051 region:rollup2
KENNECOTT A TRAP WHERE THEY

00:40:51.082 --> 00:40:53.785 region:rollup2
DON'T INTEND TO VIOLATE THE LAW.

00:40:53.051 --> 00:40:55.253 region:rollup2
OUR INTENTION IS.

00:40:53.785 --> 00:40:57.155 region:rollup2
TO LIVE ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY

00:40:55.253 --> 00:40:58.656 region:rollup2
WHERE SOMEBODY IS NOT ALLEGING

00:40:57.155 --> 00:41:00.258 region:rollup2
IN OUT I TALK TO YOU THREE TIMES

00:40:58.656 --> 00:41:01.559 region:rollup2
NEED AND DISCLOSE THE CONFLICT

00:41:00.258 --> 00:41:03.127 region:rollup2
BUT YOU'RE ENTERING INTO A

00:41:01.559 --> 00:41:04.862 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP WITH.

00:41:03.127 --> 00:41:07.231 region:rollup2
THE AGENT.

00:41:04.862 --> 00:41:08.499 region:rollup2
AT IF THAT IS AN AREA THAT I

00:41:07.231 --> 00:41:09.100 region:rollup2
THINK WE COULD BENEFIT FROM

00:41:08.499 --> 00:41:10.501 region:rollup2
HAVING THE INDUSTRIES AND PUT

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:12.770 region:rollup2
ON.

00:41:10.501 --> 00:41:14.405 region:rollup2
I THINK THEY ARE CLEAR ABOUT

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:15.740 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO DO AND

00:41:14.405 --> 00:41:17.241 region:rollup2
THEY IN FACT STATED THAT WHERE

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:18.609 region:rollup2
WOULD WE PROBABLY MISSED THE

00:41:17.241 --> 00:41:20.511 region:rollup2
MARKET WOULD BE GREAT TO. HAVE

00:41:18.609 --> 00:41:21.479 region:rollup2
SOME PROPOSED LANGUAGE IF THEY

00:41:20.511 --> 00:41:23.147 region:rollup2
FEEL LIKE THAT DOES MISS THE

00:41:21.479 --> 00:41:25.249 region:rollup2
MARK I'M WITH YOU KNOW IT'S AYE

00:41:23.147 --> 00:41:26.951 region:rollup2
AYE. AYE ALSO NOT IN THE

00:41:25.249 --> 00:41:27.852 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY IT'S VERY HARD SO WE

00:41:26.951 --> 00:41:29.120 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH BOTH

00:41:27.852 --> 00:41:30.488 region:rollup2
SIDES OF THE INDUSTRY THOSE THAT

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:32.290 region:rollup2
REPRESENT ONLY TENANTS IN THOSE

00:41:30.488 --> 00:41:33.624 region:rollup2
THAT DO TO AGENTS. TECH TO COME

00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:35.326 region:rollup2
UP WITH THE APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE

00:41:33.624 --> 00:41:36.961 region:rollup2
SO IT'S NOT A GOTCHA IT'S NOT

00:41:35.326 --> 00:41:38.529 region:rollup2
MEANT TO BE A GOTCHA IT'S MEANT.

00:41:36.961 --> 00:41:39.063 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT FOLKS ARE

00:41:38.529 --> 00:41:40.898 region:rollup2
INFORMED TIME IN A TIMELY

00:41:39.063 --> 00:41:43.167 region:rollup2
MANNER.

RELATIONSHIP THAT THEY HOLD WITH

00:41:54.112 --> 00:41:57.382 region:rollup2

NOTION.

THE THE AGENCIES THAT

00:46:03.861 --> 00:46:06.330 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP IS PROBABLY ALREADY

00:46:04.495 --> 00:46:08.699 region:rollup2
BEEN ESTABLISHED SINCE THERE IS

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:10.167 region:rollup2
IN FACT AS A PRINCIPAL IN THERE.

00:46:08.699 --> 00:46:11.369 region:rollup2
SO THE NOTION WAS TO TRY IT AND

00:46:10.167 --> 00:46:13.104 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH.

00:46:11.369 --> 00:46:15.740 region:rollup2
AND NOTICE

00:46:13.104 --> 00:46:17.441 region:rollup2

THE RELATIONSHIP.

00:46:20.878 --> 00:46:24.949 region:rollup2
WHEN THERE IS ACTIVITY WHEN

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:27.518 region:rollup2
AGENCY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AT

00:46:24.949 --> 00:46:29.587 region:rollup2
LEAST TO SOME EXTENT THAT BAN

00:46:27.518 --> 00:46:32.223 region:rollup2
THE TENANT HAS KNOWLEDGE BEFORE

00:46:29.587 --> 00:46:33.891 region:rollup2
GOING ANY FURTHER. OF THE

00:46:32.223 --> 00:46:35.326 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL BEFORE.

00:46:33.891 --> 00:46:36.661 region:rollup2
A CONFLICT OF INTEREST THINK

00:46:35.326 --> 00:46:37.662 region:rollup2
THAT WAS THE INTENT AND THAT'S

00:46:36.661 --> 00:46:39.664 region:rollup2
WHY THAT LANGUAGE WAS WRITTEN

00:46:37.662 --> 00:46:47.104 region:rollup2
THAT WAY TO TO TRY AND BUILD IN

00:46:39.664 --> 00:46:49.340 region:rollup2
THE NOTION OF OF AGENCY ALREADY.

00:46:47.104 --> 00:46:51.342 region:rollup2
SCULLY.

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:52.977 region:rollup2
JUST A BRIEF WE FOLLOW UP ON NOW

00:46:51.342 --> 00:46:54.779 region:rollup2
ARE VICE CHAIRS AYE QUESTIONS SO

00:46:52.977 --> 00:46:55.980 region:rollup2
I I. I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH YOU

00:46:54.779 --> 00:46:57.481 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:58.883 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THE PARTIES TO ONE

00:46:57.481 --> 00:47:00.918 region:rollup2
OF THESE TRANSACTIONS.

00:46:58.883 --> 00:47:01.419 region:rollup2
SHOULD NOW IF THERE'S A DUAL

00:47:00.918 --> 00:47:02.753 region:rollup2
AGENCY AND SEEN THAT THE

00:47:01.419 --> 00:47:04.622 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION AGREES THAT TO.

00:47:02.753 --> 00:47:05.222 region:rollup2
.

00:47:04.622 --> 00:47:06.724 region:rollup2
I THINK MR FUSE YOU SAID THAT

00:47:05.222 --> 00:47:08.192 region:rollup2
THE EXISTING DISCLOSURES ARE ARE

00:47:06.724 --> 00:47:10.628 region:rollup2
INEFFECTIVE RIGHT.

00:47:08.192 --> 00:47:11.495 region:rollup2
AND SO DOES THIS BILL SUPERSEDE

00:47:10.628 --> 00:47:13.230 region:rollup2
THOSE EXISTING INEFFECTIVE

00:47:11.495 --> 00:47:16.834 region:rollup2
DISCLOSURES.

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:18.069 region:rollup2
OR DOES IT EVEN PLACE.

00:47:16.834 --> 00:47:19.403 region:rollup2
NOT SURE THAT IT LEAVES THEM A

00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:21.172 region:rollup2
PLACE BECAUSE EXISTING

00:47:19.403 --> 00:47:22.606 region:rollup2
DISCLOSURES DON'T JUST HAVE TO

00:47:21.172 --> 00:47:24.475 region:rollup2
DO WITH DUAL AGENCY IT'S ON A

00:47:22.606 --> 00:47:26.844 region:rollup2
VERY SAFE YOU SEE TINY PRINT TWO

00:47:24.475 --> 00:47:28.045 region:rollup2
PAGE FORM WHICH INCLUDES.

00:47:26.844 --> 00:47:29.313 region:rollup2
THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF A

00:47:28.045 --> 00:47:30.881 region:rollup2
BUYER'S AGENT THE RESPONSIBILITY

00:47:29.313 --> 00:47:32.383 region:rollup2
OF A SELLER'S AGENT SO IT'S AN

00:47:30.881 --> 00:47:34.819 region:rollup2
AGENCY DISCLOSURE IT'S NOT

00:47:32.383 --> 00:47:36.854 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC TO THE INDIVIDUAL DUAL

00:47:34.819 --> 00:47:38.122 region:rollup2

MAKE.

00:48:10.287 --> 00:48:13.557 region:rollup2
MORE COMMON LANGUAGE FOR A

WHAT DEFINES A LICENSE LICENSED

00:51:49.306 --> 00:51:52.843 region:rollup2
ACTIVITY BUT I'M HEARING FROM

00:51:51.108 --> 00:51:54.578 region:rollup2
YOU THAT THAT IS AN AREA THAT

00:51:52.843 --> 00:51:56.146 region:rollup2
YOU'RE WILLING TO TALK TO THE

00:51:54.578 --> 00:51:58.315 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION ABOUT. AND I FROM THE

00:51:56.146 --> 00:52:00.551 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION SOUNDS LIKE THEY HAVE

00:51:58.315 --> 00:52:02.152 region:rollup2
IDEAS ON WHAT LICENCED ACTIVITY

00:52:00.551 --> 00:52:03.487 region:rollup2
WOULD TO BE.

00:52:02.152 --> 00:52:04.989 region:rollup2
SO THAT IS AN AREA THAT YOU ARE

00:52:03.487 --> 00:52:07.091 region:rollup2
STILL WILLING TO WORK WITH THE

00:52:07.091 --> 00:52:11.929 region:rollup2
THAT DEFINED.

00:52:09.126 --> 00:52:14.064 region:rollup2

CODE AND IT'S ANY ACTION THAT

LICENSED TO DO THAT.

00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:24.742 region:rollup2

00:52:21.839 --> 00:52:25.642 region:rollup2
IF IF THERE IS A REASON WHY THAT

00:52:24.742 --> 00:52:27.144 region:rollup2

INDUSTRY I DON'T THINK ANYONE ON

00:52:44.695 --> 00:52:46.764 region:rollup2
ON THIS PANEL BUT IF THEY'RE

THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME

00:52:46.764 --> 00:52:49.299 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

00:52:48.599 --> 00:52:51.702 region:rollup2

WHAT WE TRY TO AVOID IS THAT

00:53:24.868 --> 00:53:27.705 region:rollup2
SITUATION WHERE UP FRONT WHEN

00:53:26.637 --> 00:53:29.273 region:rollup2
WE'RE DEALING WITH LOOKING FOR A

00:53:27.705 --> 00:53:31.108 region:rollup2
PLACE I'M A TENANT?

00:53:29.273 --> 00:53:32.509 region:rollup2
I'M A SMALL BUSINESS WHO JUST

00:53:31.108 --> 00:53:34.578 region:rollup2
WANTS TO FIND A PLACE TO PUT MY

00:53:32.509 --> 00:53:36.013 region:rollup2
D'ELIA GOT THREE POSSIBLE AREAS

00:53:34.578 --> 00:53:38.282 region:rollup2
TO BE IN THAT AREA THAT I WANT

00:53:36.013 --> 00:53:39.983 region:rollup2
TO BE. AND I CALL SOMEBODY AND

00:53:38.282 --> 00:53:42.586 region:rollup2
SAY IN THAT THERE LIKE THEY KNOW

00:53:39.983 --> 00:53:43.320 region:rollup2
THAT THEY REPRESENT ALSO THAT

00:53:42.586 --> 00:53:45.722 region:rollup2
THE LANDLORDS IN THOSE THREE

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:46.557 region:rollup2
AREAS BUT THEY'RE JUST UP FRONT

00:53:45.722 --> 00:53:49.560 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN

00:53:46.557 --> 00:53:50.127 region:rollup2
UP FRONT IMPROVE IT BY. TWO

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:50.794 region:rollup2
SENTENCES THAT SAY I MIDDLE

00:53:50.127 --> 00:53:51.395 region:rollup2
AGED.

00:53:50.794 --> 00:53:52.262 region:rollup2
IF THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH

00:53:51.395 --> 00:53:53.564 region:rollup2
THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

00:53:52.262 --> 00:53:54.865 region:rollup2
CONCERN IS.

00:53:53.564 --> 00:53:56.233 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S GOOD FOR PEOPLE

00:53:54.865 --> 00:53:57.167 region:rollup2
HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR

00:53:56.233 --> 00:53:57.701 region:rollup2
AGENTS AND TO BE CLEAR ABOUT

00:53:57.167 --> 00:53:59.670 region:rollup2
THAT SO IF WE NEED TO TALK

00:53:57.701 --> 00:54:01.438 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:03.240 region:rollup2
FURTHER CLARIFY WHAT LICENSE

00:54:01.438 --> 00:54:05.109 region:rollup2
ACTIVITY WHAT WOULD TRIGGER.

00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:06.477 region:rollup2
A SITUATION BY WHICH I THINK WE

00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:08.712 region:rollup2
CAN USE LIT WE DID UNITS LOOSE

00:54:06.477 --> 00:54:09.313 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE ON THE LICENSE ACTIVITY

00:54:08.712 --> 00:54:09.713 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT WE STILL GIVE THEM

00:54:09.313 --> 00:54:12.316 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

00:54:09.713 --> 00:54:13.550 region:rollup2
CALLIE.

ASKING YOU KNOW YOU YOU MIGHT

00:54:15.753 --> 00:54:18.489 region:rollup2

ON THAT'S WHY I THINK

00:54:23.627 --> 00:54:27.564 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S EASY TO SAY WELL

00:54:25.028 --> 00:54:29.066 region:rollup2
LET'S NOT DO IT BECAUSE I'M.

00:54:27.564 --> 00:54:32.202 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE OPPOSITION WILL

00:54:29.066 --> 00:54:32.769 region:rollup2
PROVIDE POSSIBLE LANGUAGE.

00:54:32.202 --> 00:54:36.006 region:rollup2

00:56:52.542 --> 00:56:56.313 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION I'M JUGGLING A COUPLE

00:56:53.944 --> 00:56:57.881 region:rollup2
OF COMMITTEES. ON I WAS REALLY

00:56:56.313 --> 00:56:59.149 region:rollup2
SURPRISED IN THE INTERIM HOW

00:56:57.881 --> 00:57:00.684 region:rollup2
MANY MEDIA REQUESTS I WAS ASKED

00:56:59.149 --> 00:57:02.686 region:rollup2
TO TAKE ABOUT THIS BILL.

00:57:00.684 --> 00:57:04.154 region:rollup2

AGENCIES AND YOU'VE SHIFTED IT

00:57:07.024 --> 00:57:10.661 region:rollup2
TO DISCLOSURE. I DO THINK THAT

00:57:09.493 --> 00:57:12.396 region:rollup2
THERE STILL IS LACK OF CLARITY

00:57:10.661 --> 00:57:15.365 region:rollup2
IN THE LANGUAGE AND.

00:57:12.396 --> 00:57:16.133 region:rollup2
IF THIS COMMITTEE WANTS TO MOVE

00:57:15.365 --> 00:57:18.702 region:rollup2

00:57:42.359 --> 00:57:46.029 region:rollup2
THESE DISCLOSURES CAN BE AND AND

00:57:44.027 --> 00:57:48.598 region:rollup2

TIME AND HAVE HAD THE

00:59:01.838 --> 00:59:06.043 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO OPERATE UNDER

00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:07.444 region:rollup2
DUAL AGENCY. AND I WILL NEVER

00:59:06.043 --> 00:59:08.845 region:rollup2
SAY THAT ANYTHING IS PERFECT I

00:59:07.444 --> 00:59:10.580 region:rollup2
WILL NEVER SAY THAT. IT

00:59:08.845 --> 00:59:11.581 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISHES EVERYTHING THAT WE

00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:14.851 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE TO SEE.

00:59:11.581 --> 00:59:16.353 region:rollup2
HAPPEN BUT I DO THINK THAT.

00:59:14.851 --> 00:59:18.422 region:rollup2
AND AND WHEN AGENTS AREN'T

00:59:16.353 --> 00:59:20.123 region:rollup2
PERFORMING UNDER THE THE

00:59:18.422 --> 00:59:22.059 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES AS THEY'RE SUPPOSED

00:59:20.123 --> 00:59:24.361 region:rollup2
TO THERE IS RECOURSE.

00:59:22.059 --> 00:59:25.495 region:rollup2
AND I BELIEVE THAT.

00:59:24.361 --> 00:59:27.197 region:rollup2
CAN THIS BE MADE BETTER.

00:59:25.495 --> 00:59:29.499 region:rollup2
PROBABLY CAN BE.

00:59:27.197 --> 00:59:30.567 region:rollup2
IS THIS TE APPROACH THAT GETS

00:59:29.499 --> 00:59:33.670 region:rollup2
US THERE.

00:59:30.567 --> 00:59:35.572 region:rollup2
I'M NOT THERE YET AND AND SO I

00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:36.206 region:rollup2
WILL BE LAYING OFF THE BILL

00:59:35.572 --> 00:59:38.241 region:rollup2
TODAY.

00:59:36.206 --> 00:59:40.043 region:rollup2
SHOULD IT OF PROGRESS IN THE

00:59:38.241 --> 00:59:42.612 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

00:59:40.043 --> 00:59:43.980 region:rollup2
THEN I KNOW THAT THE OPPOSITION

00:59:42.612 --> 00:59:45.449 region:rollup2
WILL NEED TO COME TOGETHER AND

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:46.950 region:rollup2
SORT OF BE CLEAR I UNDERSTAND

00:59:45.449 --> 00:59:48.518 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS ANOTHER TRACK THAT

00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:49.853 region:rollup2
THE SEEMINGLY R. ON WHICH I

00:59:48.518 --> 00:59:53.723 region:rollup2

THAT WITH US IN TERMS THE BE BE

00:59:55.358 --> 00:59:59.729 region:rollup2
MP PROCESS. OB SO I THINK THAT'S

00:59:58.495 --> 01:00:01.498 region:rollup2
GOOD BUT I DO.

00:59:59.729 --> 01:00:03.934 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT IF THERE.

01:00:01.498 --> 01:00:04.534 region:rollup2
WAS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT THEY

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:06.336 region:rollup2
COULD HAVE TAKEN AND DID NOT

01:00:04.534 --> 01:00:07.737 region:rollup2
TAKE.

01:00:06.336 --> 01:00:08.772 region:rollup2
TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU TO TRY TO

01:00:07.737 --> 01:00:10.340 region:rollup2
BE AT LEAST CLEAR ON WHAT THEY

01:00:08.772 --> 01:00:12.109 region:rollup2
CAN.

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:13.610 region:rollup2
AT TO THIS BILL AS IT RELATES TO

S. TYPE OF DISCLOSURE.

01:00:15.579 --> 01:00:21.952 region:rollup2
THEN THEY SHOULD HAVE.

01:00:19.015 --> 01:00:22.719 region:rollup2
BUT THAT WOULD NOTWITHSTANDING.

01:00:21.952 --> 01:00:24.354 region:rollup2
MY OWN PERSONAL.

01:00:22.719 --> 01:00:26.189 region:rollup2
.

01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:27.491 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE

01:00:26.189 --> 01:00:29.493 region:rollup2
THROUGH THIS PROCESS WOULD LEAD

01:00:27.491 --> 01:00:31.027 region:rollup2
ME NOT TO BE THERE TO SUPPORT IT

01:00:29.493 --> 01:00:32.629 region:rollup2
