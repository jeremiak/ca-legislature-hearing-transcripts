THE- TO THE AFFORD HOUSING THE

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:29.408
STATE OF. COMMUNITY GRANDPA. IS

00:08:29.475 --> 00:08:31.811
THAT SET ASIDE FOR A- STILL TEND

00:08:31.878 --> 00:08:35.715
. OR HAS IT INC. AND THAT MAY

00:08:35.781 --> 00:08:40.853
NEED TO COME FROM MR OLMSTEAD.

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.656
WHILE WE ADMINISTER ON BEHALF OF

00:08:43.723 --> 00:08:44.790
THE SPEAKER COUNCILS THE RIGHT.

00:08:44.857 --> 00:08:47.760
SET OF POLICIES BUT- SO BILLS

00:08:47.827 --> 00:08:49.095
COULD ALWAYS CERTAINLY BE

00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:50.997
ADDRESSED AT THIS RECALL COUNCIL

00:08:51.063 --> 00:08:52.698
BUT THIS AUGMENTATION IS

00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:55.701
ESSENTIALLY ADDITIONAL FUSION

00:08:55.768 --> 00:08:56.903
UNDER THE CURRENT RULES. ALL

00:08:56.969 --> 00:08:58.104
RIGHT SO YOU CAN'T TELL ME

00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:59.639
WHETHER IT'S STILL 210% OR

00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:03.542
WHETHER IT'S BEEN INCREASED.

00:09:03.609 --> 00:09:05.611
IT'S OKAY IF YOU DON'T KNOW. I'M

00:09:05.678 --> 00:09:08.014
JUST NEED TO KNOW YEAH I CAN I

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.181
CAN EASILY OTHER COLLEAGUES TO

00:09:09.248 --> 00:09:09.949
GET THAT INFORMATION TO READ

00:09:10.016 --> 00:09:11.517
BACK YOUR CHRISTENING UP YOU

00:09:11.584 --> 00:09:12.919
WERE GOING TO PLAN. YEAH CHRIS

00:09:12.985 --> 00:09:14.287
COOK WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:09:14.353 --> 00:09:16.222
AS AS I CAN TO CREATED THIS IS.

00:09:16.289 --> 00:09:17.924
THE PROPOSED- INFUSION GENERAL

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.092
FUND IS IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE

00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:22.128
EXISTING- AGENCY PROGRAM SO

00:09:22.194 --> 00:09:23.629
THERE'S NO PROPOSED CHANGES TO

00:09:23.696 --> 00:09:25.498
THE SATISFIED BUT- AGAIN WE CAN

00:09:25.564 --> 00:09:27.500
CONFIRM THAT WAY R. O. PR CAL.

00:09:27.566 --> 00:09:29.135
COLLEAGUES THAT WOULD BE GREAT

00:09:29.201 --> 00:09:31.938
SO MY POINT THERE IS THAT. IN

00:09:32.004 --> 00:09:34.507
THE PAST. THAT CAN PERCENT SET

00:09:34.573 --> 00:09:36.709
ASIDE WAS CREATED WHEN I WAS ON

00:09:36.776 --> 00:09:38.311
THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL AND

00:09:38.377 --> 00:09:40.880
SPECIFICALLY. BECAUSE NO RURAL

00:09:40.947 --> 00:09:43.249
COMMUNITIES COULD QUALIFY. WHEN

00:09:43.316 --> 00:09:44.884
YOU WHEN YOU COME IN WHEN YOU

00:09:44.951 --> 00:09:46.485
CREATE A COMPETITIVE GRANT

00:09:46.552 --> 00:09:52.191
PROGRAM AND THE AWARD IS GIVEN.

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:52.825
TO REDUCE CLIMATE CHANGE. YOU'RE

00:09:52.892 --> 00:09:55.328
pAND YOU WILL NEVER EVER HAVE

00:09:55.394 --> 00:09:56.896
ENOUGH POINTS IN ORDER TO BE TO

00:09:56.963 --> 00:09:58.464
QUALIFY SO. SO THE PROGRAM

00:09:58.531 --> 00:10:00.032
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST RURAL

00:10:00.099 --> 00:10:01.567
COMMUNITIES WE CREATED A SET

00:10:01.634 --> 00:10:03.302
ASIDE AND I AND SO IF YOU COULD

00:10:03.369 --> 00:10:05.071
GET BACK TO ME ON. WHETHER THE

00:10:05.137 --> 00:10:06.605
SET ASIDE HAS BEEN INCREASE THAT

00:10:06.672 --> 00:10:07.640
WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL IN OUR

00:10:07.707 --> 00:10:09.709
DELIBERATIONS BECAUSE IT MAY BE

00:10:09.775 --> 00:10:11.610
THAT WE WANT THAT. SET ASIDE TO

00:10:11.677 --> 00:10:15.314
BE IN YEAH INCREASED AND- THE

00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:16.983
REASON THIS BECOMES PARTICULARLY

00:10:17.049 --> 00:10:19.885
IMPORTANT. IS AS WE LOOK AT THE

00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:23.222
EXPENDITURE OF FUNDS IN ALL OF

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:24.657
THESE DIFFERENT FUND CATEGORIES

00:10:24.724 --> 00:10:28.160
. THE DISTRIBUTION TO THE

00:10:28.227 --> 00:10:30.496
WEALTHIER. COASTAL AREAS IS

00:10:30.563 --> 00:10:34.567
COMPOSED TO THE INNER AREAS OF

00:10:34.633 --> 00:10:37.203
THE STATE BECOMES PROBLEMATIC

00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:39.538
THERE ISN'T THE ACCESS TO

00:10:39.605 --> 00:10:40.272
RESOURCES AND SO THAT'S THE

00:10:40.339 --> 00:10:42.641
REASON FOR THE QUESTION AND IT

00:10:42.708 --> 00:10:47.747
IS NOTICED. AND IN IN OUR- OUR

00:10:47.813 --> 00:10:51.050
SUBCOMMITTEE RIGHT AT THAT- THAT

00:10:51.117 --> 00:10:53.052
THERE THERE ARE FEWER

00:10:53.119 --> 00:10:54.620
OPPORTUNITIES IN RURAL OR

00:10:54.687 --> 00:10:57.089
UNDERDEVELOPED AREAS TO BE ABLE

00:10:57.156 --> 00:10:58.124
TO ACCESS THE IF THE AFFORDABLE

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.926
HOUSING. RESOURCES AND I WANT TO

00:11:00.993 --> 00:11:02.495
MAKE SURE THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND

00:11:02.561 --> 00:11:04.330
THAT IN THAT WERE WILLING TO

00:11:04.397 --> 00:11:07.299
ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF POOR AND

00:11:07.366 --> 00:11:10.102
RURAL COMMUNITIES AS WELL- I

00:11:10.169 --> 00:11:14.206

IN A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT PLACES

00:11:17.276 --> 00:11:19.512
BUT I THINK THAT'S THE SUM TOTAL

00:11:19.578 --> 00:11:22.148
OF ACT THAT ISSUE SO THIS IS A

00:11:22.214 --> 00:11:26.252
