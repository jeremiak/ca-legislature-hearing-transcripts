SERVICE TO IT AB TWENTY EIGHTY WELCOME THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR WORKING WITH THE WITH ME ON THIS BILL AND THE ASSAULT THANK YOU FOR THE EXCELLENT ANALYSIS AT ODDS. IT WAS A GOOD READ. I HAVE MADE. IMPROVING ACCESS AND CAN ONLY GO TO CIRCUS WOULD I'M NOT SURE I DON'T THINK WE'RE ON. NO I DON'T THINK YOU ARE ON THAT THE BUTTONS ARE CORRECT. BUT I'M STILL NOT I'M NOT HEARING YOU ALTHOUGH IT'S HARD TO LOWER FROM UP HERE HELLO. NO I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER SEE PICS OF BETTER THAN THAT. IT'S ON- IT'S ON YEAH IT'S OKAY I WOULD JUST WASN'T HEARING IT SORRY GO AHEAD OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'LL START OVER- THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU OKAY. K. POP UP WINDOWS INSTEAD THAT'S- FINE. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR. FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS BILL AND THE CONSULTANT THANK YOU FOR THE EXCELLENT ANALYSIS IT WAS A GOOD READ. OP I'VE MADE ACCESS OF IMPROVING ACCESS AND QUALITY TO HEALTH CARE AND- CONTAINING THE COSTS OF HEALTH CARE ONE OF MY TOP PRIORITIES. THIS BILL IS NO DIFFERENT. CONSOLIDATION IN HEALTH CARE HAS NOT PROVEN TO INCREASE EFFICIENCIES AND QUALITY NOR CONTAIN COSTS. THIS BILL PROHIBITS SIX TYPES OF ANTI COMPETITIVE CONTRACT PROVISIONS INTO HOSPITALS BUT ALSO TO HEALTH PLANS INSURERS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA'S ATTORNEY GENERAL HODIERNA SARAH FILE FILED A CIVIL ANTITRUST ACTION UNDER THE CART RIGHT ACT AGAINST THE SUTTER HEALTH HOSPITAL SYSTEM IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AFTER YEARS OF LITIGATION MILLIONS OF DOLLARS SPENT THE AGE SHE WAS SUCCESSFUL. RESULTING IN A FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS SETTLEMENT AN AGREEMENT BY SUTTER TO CHANGE A NUMBER OF ITS ANTI COMPETITIVE PRACTICES. HAVE THIS LEGISLATION YOU'RE HEARING TODAY BEEN IN PLACE THERE'S A GOOD VERY GOOD CHANCE WE COULD HAVE PREVENTED YEARS OF ANTI COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR. AND COST TO PATIENTS NOT TO MENTION THE TIME AND MONEY SPENT ON THE LITIGATION. AB TWENTY EIGHTY WOULD SIMPLY CODIFY THE CHANGES MADE BY THE CENTER SETTLEMENT BOTH INDUSTRY WIDE AND STATEWIDE. NO ONE IS SAYING THAT EVERY CONSOLIDATION IS BAD. BUT THE SEPARATE LITIGATION TOOK US THROUGH THE COMPREHENSIVE PROCESS THAT THE AG COULD USE TO LOOK AT PENDING CONSOLIDATIONS TO ENSURE THAT THEY WOULD ALSO BENEFIT HEALTH CARE CONSUMERS NOT SOLELY CORPORATE PROFITS. NATIONAL HEALTHCARE SPENDING IS PROJECTED TO GROW AT AN AVERAGE ANNUAL RATE OF FIVE POINT 4% FOR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TO TWO THOUSAND TWENTY EIGHT. MUCH FASTER THAN THE AT THE AVERAGE ANNUAL AND PRE PANDEMIC GROWTH OF FOUR POINT 2% FROM TWENTY TEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN. THE INDUSTRY ARGUES THAT CONSOLIDATION IMPROVES QUALITY. BUT THEIR ARGUMENT IS ONLY SUPPORTED BY INDUSTRY SPONSORED STUDIES. THIS BILL IS SUPPORTED BY SMALL BUSINESS CAN BUSINESSES CONSUMERS HEALTH CARE ADVOCATES AND LABOR. AND OPPOSED BY THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT WERE EXPERIENCES REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT BENEFITS TO HEALTHCARE CONSUMERS THE OPPOSITION NEED NOT BE CONCERNED. THAT IT PUSHES THE ORGANIZATIONS THEY WANT TO CONSOLIDATE TO KEEP THOSE CONSUMERS IN MIND AS WELL WE'RE ALL BETTER OFF FOR ME. PLEASE I'D LIKE TO HEAR YOU TO HEAR FROM MY WITNESSES- WITH US TODAY BETH CAPELL WITH HEALTH ACCESS. AND JENNA SO MELLIE WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. THANK YOU AND MISS WOULD BEFORE WE GO TO. THE WITNESSES THEIR AMENDMENTS LISTED STARTING ON PAGE TEN YOU'RE TAKING THOSE AUTHORS OF ADMINS YES SIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. RIGHT FIRST WITNESS PLEASE BETH BELL AND THEY HAVE HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA WE ARE THE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION FOR HEALTHCARE IN CALIFORNIA. WE SUPPORTED BE TWENTY EIGHTY BECAUSE WE KNOW FROM AN APPLE ACADEMIC LITERATURE THE CONSOLIDATION DRIVES UP COSTS. WITHOUT IMPROVING QUALITY AND SOMETIMES EVEN WORSE SINCE MORTALITY OR DEATH RATES. THE ONLY STUDIES THAT SHOW DIFFERENTLY OR THOSE FUNDED BY THE HOSPITAL INDUSTRY ITSELF. WE KNOW FROM THIRTY YEARS OF WORKING WITH ATTORNEYS GENERAL OF BOTH PARTIES. ON NONPROFIT HOSPITAL MERGERS THAT ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION IN CALIFORNIA HAS KEPT HOSPITALS OPEN. UP AND DOWN CALIFORNIA PROTECTED EMERGENCY ROOMS LABOR AND LABOR DELIVERY CARDIAC CARE REPRODUCTIVE SERVICES AND MORE. IN MORE RECENT YEARS ATTORNEYS GENERAL HAVE IMPOSED CONDITIONS TO PREVENT ANTI COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR SIMILAR TO WHAT SUTTER OF HIS ALLEGED TO HAVE ENGAGED IN AN TO MODERATE POST CONSOLIDATION PRICE INCREASES. FOR OVER A CENTURY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. GENERAL IN CALIFORNIA HAS HAD THE AUTHORITY TO INTERVENE TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AGAINST ANTI COMPETITIVE PRACTICES THE SOUTHERLY TO GET ASIAN IS EIGHT ONE OF THE MORE RECENT EXAMPLES OF THAT. YOU WILL HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL REVIEW MAKES BUSINESS DECISIONS MORE EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS NINETY DAYS WITH THE ONE FORTY FIVE DAY EXTENSION IN WHICH TO REVIEW THESE TRANSACTIONS THAT'S A FAIRLY QUICK REVIEW FOR IMPORTANT PROCESS. IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS DOZENS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING NONPROFIT HOSPITALS HAVE PRECEDED MOST WITHOUT CONTROVERSY MOST WITH CONDITIONS THAT PROTECT CONSUMERS. WHAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAN DO THAT CANNOT BE DONE WITHOUT THIS OVERSIGHT IS TO IMPOSE ENFORCEABLE CONDITIONS KEEP HOSPITALS OPEN AND EMERGENCY ROOMS IN LABOR AND DELIVERY AND MORE. YOU WILL ALSO HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT SOMEHOW AB TWENTY EIGHTY UNWINDS MANAGED CARE IN ON DOES INTEGRATED DELIVERY SYSTEMS NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH INTEGRATED DELIVERY SYSTEMS WHETHER IT'S KAISER OR SUTTER OR SHARP. INCLUDE A HEALTH PLAN AS WELL AS A HOSPITAL SYSTEM SYSTEM IN THE PHYSICIAN GROUP ALL OF THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT HEALTH ACCESS HAS FOUGHT FOR. TIMELY ACCESS NETWORK ADEQUACY RATE REVIEW FISCAL SOLVENCY ON AND ON OR IMPOSE ON THE HEALTH PLAN WHICH THEN CONTRACTS WITH THE HOSPITAL SYSTEM IN THE HOUSE AND THE PHYSICIAN ORGANIZATION. THOSE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS OR THE ONES WE HOLD DEAR CREATING AN INTEGRATED DELIVERY SYSTEM WITHOUT THEM IS SOMETHING WE STRONGLY OPPOSE FOR THOSE REASONS WE'RE DELIGHTED TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY EIGHTY. AND LOOK FORWARD TO OUR CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT YES GOOD MORNING I CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR STRONG SUPPORT. FOR AB TWENTY EIGHTY MY NAME IS JENNIFER MALLEY I AM A LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AND ITS AFFILIATES COMPRISING OF TWO POINT ONE MILLION THAT UNION MEMBERS AND THE STATE. HAVE FOUGHT FOR DECADES TO CONTROL THE RISING COST OF HEALTHCARE. THE UNCONTROLLED COST OF CARE HAS RESULTED IN SACRIFICES FOR OUR MEMBERS. AT THE BARGAINING TABLE WHO OFTENTIMES CHOOSE TO FORGO HIGHER WAGES JUST TO MAINTAIN THEIR HIGH QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. FOUR YEARS AGO THE U. F. C. W. AND EMPLOYERS BENEFIT TRUST WHICH IS THE HEALTH PLAN FOR- THE UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST THAT SUTTER HEALTH. AFTER AN INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT THE RAPID CONSOLIDATION AMONG HOSPITALS PHYSICIANS AND NURSES AND INSURERS IN CALIFORNIA LEAD TO HIGHER COSTS AND IT'S DOCTOR WOULD SAID IN HIS OPENING REMARKS SUTTER HEALTH- EVENTUALLY AGREED TO PAY. FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO SETTLE THOSE CLAIMS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SHOULD HAVE EXTENDED OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY OVER NONPROFIT HOSPITAL MERGERS. AND ALL HEALTH SYSTEM TRANSACTIONS IN ORDER TO REVIEW THE IMPACT ON QUALITY. COST AND ACCESS TO NEEDED SERVICES. THIS IS ESSENTIAL TO GETTING COSTS UNDER CONTROL. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT HIGH PRICES FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES DRIVEN BY INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION AND ANTI COMPETITIVE PRACTICES HAVE DRAMATICALLY INCREASED HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS FOR EMPLOYERS WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. THIS HAS RESULTED IN LOWER WAGES FOR WORKERS AND SLOWER JOB GROWTH. IN OTHER WORDS AB TWENTY EIGHTY IS NOT JUST HEALTHCARE BILL IT IS THE WAGES AND JOB GROWTH BILL CROWDING OUT THE REST OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY AND WE CAN'T LET THIS CONTINUE. WE NEED LEGISLATION THAT WILL MAKE HEALTH CARE MARKETS WORK THE WAY THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO RESULTING IN LOWER PRICES A STRONGER ECONOMY AND MORE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR CALIFORNIANS. I THANK YOU AND WE ALSO REQUEST YOUR BOTH THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT IS THERE ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE SUPPORT FOR AB TWENTY EIGHTY COME TO THE MICROPHONE AND WE'LL BE TAKING NAME AFFILIATION AND SUPPORT ONLY NO FURTHER TESTIMONY HI KAREN MEMBERS BETH NON OWSKI WITH SEIU STATE COUNCIL.

GOOD MORNING ALEXANDRA LEN REPRESENTING NEXT IN CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU I'M THIRTY ONE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD MORNING ORINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW POVERTY IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND WE HAVE NO FURTHER SUPPORT IN CUBA STRUCTURE. THANK YOU BEFORE WE MOVED OPPOSITION I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST ESTABLISH A QUORUM STONE HERE CUNNINGHAM DAVIES KALRA KILEY. MAIENSCHEIN REYES RIGHT HERE RIVAS. LEE WICKS. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A QUORUM RIGHT WE WILL NOW MOVE TO OPPOSITION. COME UP. MORNING GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN BIRDS OF THE CABINET COMMITTEE MY NAME STEEP MARK ROMAN I'M WITH CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION HERE IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY. I WANT TOSPEAK BRIEFLY TO THE VALUE OF INTEGRATED NETWORKS HOSPITAL SYSTEMS AND THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE CARE- IN UNDERSERVED AREAS TO FLEX RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THAT SPECIALTY CARE IS AVAILABLE IN THOSE AREAS. VERY CONCERNED THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL WOULD MAKE THAT HARDER TO ACCOMPLISH. WANT TO SPEAK VERY SPECIFICALLY TO- THE EXPANDED AUTHORITY OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OVER HEALTHCARE TRANSACTIONS NOT JUST HOSPITALS BUT OHER SECTORS- UP OF THE HEALTHCARE FIELD. I CONCERNS THAT THERE ARE NOT DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS- THE BILL PROVIDES FOR A PUBLIC HEARING VERY MUCH LIKE THIS ONE WITH THERE IS PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND PUBLIC TESTIMONY. BUT IT'S NOT- HEARING ON THE EVIDENCE THAT'S NOT THE PRESENTATION OF EVIDENCE THE ABILITY TO BE HEARD BEFORE THE- REGULATOR MAKES A DECISION TO RESPOND TO EVIDENCE TO PROVIDE COUNTERVAILING EVIDENCE- IT'S A COMPLETE DELEGATION OF DISCRETION- TWO ONE INDIVIDUAL. AND WE BELIEVE THAT VIOLATES DUE PROCESS- IT MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO RESPOND TO A CHANGING HEALTH CARE ENVIRONMENT WHEN THERE IS NOT CERTAINTY. IN WHAT THE PROCESS IS GOING TO BE AND WHAT KIND OF CONDITIONS ARE GOING TO COME OUT. SO NOT ONLY IS THERE THE TIMELINE HAS THIS BEEN REFERENCED BY THE SUPPORTERS OF NINETY DAYS THOSE ARE ROUTINELY EXTENDED BECAUSE THE REGULATOR REQUESTS MORE TIME IN THE PARTICIPANT OF COURSE AGREES TO EXTENDING MORE TIME BECAUSE TO SAY NO WOULD MEAN YOU'D GET A DENIAL. BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY THE POINT THE CONCERN IS THAT YEARS OF PLANNING DUE DILIGENCE ANALYSIS IN A HOSPITAL TRANSACTION OCCUR BEFORE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCESS EVEN STARTS. AND THE CHILLING EFFECT THAT OCCURS WHEN ALL THAT EFFORT IS PUT INTO- DEVELOPING A NEW- A NEW HEALTH CARE MODEL A NEW TRANSACTION THE NEW SYSTEM. AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WITHOUT PROVIDING ANY REASONS. CAN SUMMARILY DENY IT AND THAT'S HAPPENED BEFORE A TRANSACTION HAS BEEN REJECTED BY A THREE SENTENCE LETTER- SO VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THAT WILL AFFECT HEALTH CARE THE HEALTHCARE PROCESS GOING FORWARD AND NOTING THAT A WRIT OF MANDATE. IS NOT DUE PROCESS BECAUSE THERE IS NO UNDERLYING RECORD FOR THE APPEALS COURT TO LOOK AT OTHER THAN ANALYSIS OF THE KEY USE OF DISCRETION- WITH THAT WOULD ASK FOR A NO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR ANYONE ELSE IN THE HEARING WHO WANTS TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY EIGHTY. MISTER CHAIRMAN RESERVE THE COMMITTEE BRANDON MARCH WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IN AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU.

PERSONALLY FOR HELPING US WITH THIS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. I WOULD SAY THAT THIS BILL HAS NOT IT NOT AS AGGRESSIVE AS I WANTED TO BE THE BEGINNING BUT IT BUT WHAT IT DOES DO IS SHOW THAT THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WORKS- OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS WE'VE CARED TO BILLS TO CHANGE- LPS CONSERVATORSHIP LAWS. LIKEWISE WE ASK FOR STATE AUDITS AND THE- COMMITTEE JURISDICTION HEALTH. ALSO HELD HEARINGS- TO HELP US WITH THIS WHAT WE DISCOVERED IS THAT THAT TO SOME DEGREE THE FOR THE SYSTEM DOES NEED FIXING I LIKE TO SAY BROKEN SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO SAY FIXING. AND SO WE COME UP WITH A BILL THAT WE THINK- STRIKES THE BALANCE TO TRY TO HELP. OUR FOLKS WHO ARE ON HOUSING AND HAVING SEVERE. MENTAL HEALTH CARE CRISIS IS- WE CALL THAT THE MENTAL HEALTH CARE COORDINATION- ACT THAT WERE PUSHING FOR TODAY WHAT DOES BASICALLY TWO THINGS- IT ALLOWS FOR A CARE COORDINATION PLAN TO KERR AT THE STATE LEVEL AND AT THE COUNTY LEVEL WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS- INVOLVED INCLUDING THOSE PLANS- IT CREATES A REPORTING FRAMEWORK CURRENTLY THERE ARE. NO MECHANISM FOR REPORTING HOW THOSE DOLLARS ARE USED WHO WAS HELP OR- DEMOGRAPHIC DATA ON. INDIVIDUALS OR HELP. AND IN THREE ALLOWS FOR MHA M. H. S. A. DOLLARS TO BE USED. FOR THAT COORDINATED KERR- IN I'LL GIVE YOU A COUPLE NUMBERS IT THAT SHOULD BE ALARMING TO ANYONE. LET'S BACK UP A SECOND SAY THAT. WHAT IT WHAT IT WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO. IS THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL WHO IS WHO IS HELD- FOR EITHER A- SEVENTY TWO HOURS. FIFTEEN DAYS THIRTY DAYS OR A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS WHAT CHANGING ANY OF THAT THOSE LAWS LAWS ALREADY EXIST. THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE A HEALTHCARE A MENTAL HEALTH CARE COORDINATION PLAN. BEFORE THEY RELEASED SIMPLY SO THAT THEY CAN GET THE WRAPAROUND SUPPORT SERVICES TO HELP THEM BE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR LIVES AND I'LL GIVE YOU SOME REALLY ALARMING NUMBERS. ON WHEN WE TOOK A LOOK AT THE AUDIT THAT WAS STRUCTURE FROM TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN AND L. PICK ON IT LIKE I AM IN L. A. COUNTY BUT THEY LOOK AT A COUPLE DIFFERENT COUNTIES- OUT OF A HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT WERE HELD. 43000403% OF THOSE PEOPLE I HAD MULTIPLE- CYCLE THROUGH THE SAME SYSTEM OUT OF OUT OF THAT TEN THOUSAND OF THOSE PEOPLE ENTERED THE SYSTEM AND LET THE SYSTEM OVER TEN TIMES. THAT SYSTEM IS BROKEN WHEN WE WHEN WE WENT WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING TO STREETS WHEN PEOPLE HELP THEY SHOULD BE GETTING THE HELP THAT THEY ABSOLUTELY NEED BUT THEY HAVEN'T AND THAT'S WHAT THE HEARING- THAT YOU HELP PUT TOGETHER REVEALED THAT THEY NEED TO BE A CORONATION PLANTS OF BOOKS CAN GET THAT. THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED DURING THE TIME- THE- THAT THEY'RE BEING HELD TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES- AND IN FACT I'M GONNA GO OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT IT WAS FIVE HUNDRED THOSE PEOPLE WENT IN AND OUT OF THE SYSTEM ABOUT SEVENTY TWO TIMES. SO WE TAKE A TAKE A LOOK AT A SYSTEM THAT IS BROKEN WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT- MISTER TERRY. YOU GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN I PROBABLY DESERVE BEING LATE TO THE- TO PRESENT- BUT ALSO MUCH SHORTER THAN HAVE BEEN THE CASE I'D LIKE TO MAKE ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT A SYSTEM THAT IS NOT HELPING. OTHER PEOPLE WHO NEED THEM THE MOST- TODAY- THOSE- THOSE OF OUR NEIGHBORS WERE ANNOUNCED. AND HAVE MENTAL HEALTH CARE- OF ISSUES AND WE'RE JUST NOT PROVIDING THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. SO I WE THINK THAT THIS IS. A MODEST BUT STILL HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF IMPACT ON THOSE INDIVIDUALS. WHO ARE ALL TRYING TO HELP. BIGGEST FEATURE. THANK YOU MR SANTIAGO ALL RIGHT.

BUT RESPOND TO CONCERNS WE HAVE RAISED INCLUDING THE STAKEHOLDER GROUPS AND CLARIFYING LANGUAGE TO ADDRESS CONCERNS. ABOUT UNNECESSARY EXTENSIONS OF INVOLUNTARY HOLDS PENDING DISCHARGE PLANNING. UNFORTUNATELY WE OPPOSE THE USE OF AN HSA FUNDS TO PAY FOR LOCKED. BOND TERRY TREATMENT. WE DO SUPPORT IMPROVEMENTS TO DISCHARGE PLANNING. WE BELIEVE IT'S CRITICAL TO REDUCE BE REVIVING DOOR HOSPITALIZATION. HOWEVER AFFECTED DISCHARGE PLANNING DEPENDS ON THE ACTUAL AVAILABILITY. OF A RANGE OF SERVICES. TO MAKE THIS CHARGE PLANNING MEETING. OUR CONCERN. IF THIS BILL ABA ON ACCOUNT HOSPITAL AND PAYERS TO CREATE THIS CHARGE PLANNED SERVICES THAT DO NOT EXIST AT THE NECESSARY SCALE. THE RECENT DH CS ASSESSMENT OF CALIFORNIANS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUUM SHOWS MANY IMPORTANT SERVICES THAT ARE CRITICAL TO EFFECTIVE DISCHARGE PLANNING FOR LACKING THROUGHOUT THE STATE. INCLUDING PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WITH WRAPAROUND SERVICES HERE SUPPORT SERVICES EVIDENCE BASED OUTPATIENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES SUCH AS THE THIRD OF COMMUNITY TREATMENT. ISIS RATHER TRANSITIONAL RESIDENTIAL AND LONG TERM RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE NO FURTHER OPPOSITION THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU OPERATOR YOU MAY CLOSE THE LINES AND I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE- COMMITTEE SANTIAGO ONE THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH US AND TAKING SOME OF THE- WE'RE TAKING THE AMENDMENTS I THINK THE WAY THAT. THAT THIS BILL IS DEALING WITH THE DISCHARGE PLAN IS REALLY VERY. IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE DEALING WITH- JUST A COUPLE OF OTHER NOTES ONE OF THE THINGS THOUGH THAT THEY THEY HEARING THAT WE HELD IN CONJUNCTION WITH HEALTH COMMITTEE. SEVERAL MONTHS AGO REALLY SHOWED WAS THE LACK OF DATA INTO ANY CHANGES TO THE. THE ACTOR SAID THE LANDER MEN FEATURES SHORT ACT. IT ARE HARD TO FOR US I THINK TO BE ABLE TO QUALIFY UNTIL WE ULTIMATELY GET GET THAT DATA AND THE PART OF THIS BILL THAT I AM. STRUGGLING WITH ALTHOUGH IT'S TECHNICALLY OUTSIDE THE JURISDICTION OF THIS COMMITTEE SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT REALLY WHAT THE BEST WAY TO DO IT IS ARE THE M. HSA FUNDS. INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT HAS IT IN IN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DAHLE VOLUNTARY TREATMENT IN THE WHOLE CARE CORE PROPOSAL THAT MIGHT INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT REALLY BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT PROVIDE CALIFORNIA'S NOT PROVIDED. THE RIGHT KINDS OF TREATMENTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND SO NOW WE'RE STUCK WITH TALKING ABOUT DO WE BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN. ACCESSING THESE THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS AND SORT OF IN AND OUT AND IN AND OUT A LOT THEY'RE NOT GETTING US FOR THE HELP THAT THEY NEED. THAT'S PART OF WHY THEY'RE IN AND OUT. OF THIS THE PROGRAMS BUT GOING TO INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT. WHICH HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED IS NOT EFFECTIVE AND CAN OFTENTIMES EXACERBATE THE CONDITION THE MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS LIKE THESE PEOPLE FACE. IS A PART THAT I REALLY STRUGGLE WITH AND EXTENDING M. HSA FUNDS TO INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT WHICH IS CLEARLY WHAT IS NOT DESIGNED TO DO AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES. IS SOMETHING THAT I DEFINITELY STRUGGLE WITH IT IS TECHNICALLY A QUESTION NOW FOR APPROACH TO DEAL WITH IT WAS SOMETHING THAT HEALTH COMMITTEE. REALLY DIDN'T. I DIDN'T ADDRESS AN APPROPRIATE WAY IT'S NOT SOMETHING WITH TECHNICALLY WITHIN OUR JURISDICTION I'M JUST RAISING THAT BECAUSE THAT DOES IS SOMETHING THAT GIVES ME SOME HARPER AND THAT'S- THE HEART OF A LOT OF THE OPPOSITION. THAT BEING SAID I THINK FOR ME THIS BILL. IS FINE TO PASS OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE. THE EVEN GIVEN THAT PARTICULAR CHALLENGE AND I'M HOPING THAT THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE WHICH-IS AN APPROPRIATE PLACE TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW FUNDS OUT OF IMAGES THEY ARE OR ARE NOT BEING SPENT. WE'LL TAKE TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK AT IT SAID THIS IS. THAT'S MY CONCERN WITH THIS THAT THAT'S MY CHALLENGE FOR THIS ALTHOUGH I THINK AND WE'VE WORKED THROUGH THIS QUITE A BIT WE'RE GOING TO BE SEEING THE CARE COURT PROPOSALS COMING- FROM THE SENATE WE'RE VERY MUCH AS A COMMITTEE INVOLVED IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS. BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO PEOPLE'S CIVIL LIBERTIES THAT'S THE MAIN CORE OF WHAT THIS COMMITTEE IS GOING TO BE IS GOING TO BE LOOKING AT. SO I THINK THIS IS. FILE ITEM HOPING WE DO PASS THIS BILL OUT TODAY I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT ONE CONCERN THAT I THINK WE STILL. NEED TO BE WORKING ON. MAY I RESPOND AS JR. I'M SURE BY YOU CAN RESPOND IN YOUR CLOSE TO WHAT WHEN THINGS I WANNA DO IS MAKE SURE THAT MEMBERS WHO HAVE QUESTIONS GET QUESTIONS MISS CUNNINGHAM. YEAH I'LL I'LL TRY TO BE FAIRLY BRIEF BECAUSE- MR MENTIONS THE GRAMMYS HE'S GOT A FLIGHT TO CATCH. UP I JUST WANT TO OFFER SOME ANECDOTAL EXPERIENCE FROM MY OWN COUNTY MY LAW PRACTICE. WHEN YOU SAY THAT PEOPLE ARE CYCLING IN OUR SYSTEM- THAT IN MY EXPERIENCE S A 100% CORRECT. THEY GO BACK THEY GET RELEASED AFTER THEIR SEVEN TWO HOURS OR WHATEVER THE HELL HOLE THIS. THEY CALMLY THERE GO BACK THE STREETS. THEY GO BACK TO ENCAMPMENTS. OR THE GO BACK TO THEIR FAMILIES. AND THEY ARE IN FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN. IN MY LAW PRACTICE. WHICH IN THE WORST CASE SCENARIO THEY GET RELEASED TO WHEREVER THEY WERE. AND THEY DON'T END UP BACK IN THE SYSTEM UNTIL. THEY COMMIT A CRIME. AND THEN YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION WHICH IS REALLY AT ITS CORE IN A LOT OF THESE CASES A MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM. A SCHIZOPHRENIC THAT'S OFF THE MEDICATION WHAT HAVE YOU- IN. THE CONTEXT OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WHICH IS- SHALL WE SAY COULD USE IMPROVEMENT AND HOW IT HANDLES THESE CASES. TO PUT IT MILDLY- SO THE CYCLING'S RAIL AND- IF I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE BILLS TRY TO CORRECTLY YOU WANT TO MAKE IT SO THAT WHEN THEY GET RELEASED. THERE'S SOME SORT OF TREATMENT PLAN DO I HAVE THAT RIGHT CORRECT AND I AND I GET THE BURDENS ON THAT AND I GET THIS COULD BE DONE A TIGHT TIMELINE ALL THAT. BUT THEY ARE COMMONLY FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN AT LEAST IN SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY THEY'RE NOT RELEASE WITH ANY KIND BUT ALL. DIRT GIVEN WHATEVER MINIMAL TREATMENT THEY THEY- IS DEEMED APPROPRIATE FOR THEIR CIRCUMSTANCE DURING THE WHOLE. AND THEN THEY'RE SENT BACK TO THEIR FAMILIES ARE SENT BACK TO WORK. TO THE STREETS ARE SENT BACK TO THE ENCAMPMENTS. AND- THAT'S WHY YOU SEE SO MANY PEOPLE I THINK CYCLING. IN AND OUT SO I AM IN SUPPORT THE BILL THE DAY. THAT I. IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT PAYMENT THING IS ABOVE MY PAY GRADE ALL THE PROBES FIGURE THAT OUT. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT STAFF ON ME AT LEAST OF THERE'S A PLAN THERE'S SOMETHING. THAT I MEAN IF NOTHING ELSE A FAMILY MEMBER. CAN LOOK AT THAT AND GO OKAY. THIS IS THE MEDICATION THEY WERE ON THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE OFF THIS IS WHAT A PROFESSIONAL IS SAYING THEY NEED. I CAN HOPEFULLY HELP GET THEM TO THE POINT WHERE THEY ARE ACCEPTING OF THAT TREATMENT VOLUNTARILY. IT GIVES IT GIVES THEM A FIGHTING CHANCE I THINK SO THANKS FOR CURRENT BILL. ALL RIGHT THIS RACE THE MISTER KALRA APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM THE CHAIR- THAT'S WHAT I STRUGGLE WITH ALSO AND WHEN I HEAR THE OPPOSITION PEOPLE THAT WE TRUST PEOPLE THAT WE THAT WOULD THAT ARE OUR ALLIES WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT THOSE CIVIL LIBERTIES. BUT I ALSO RECOGNIZE THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE IN THE SPACE AND YOUR COMMITMENT TO TRY TO FIND SOLUTIONS AND THIS IS THIS IS ONE OF THOSE. POSSIBILITIES FINDING THAT BALANCE BETWEEN TAKING CARE OF SOMEONE IN A VERY HUMANE WAY BUT ALSO PROTECTING THEIR CIVIL LIBERTIES SO THAT WE DON'T OVERSTEP ON EITHER SIDE. AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE HEADED IN THAT DIRECTION AND I. I APPRECIATE THAT A FROM YOU AND I TOO WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HOW IT PROGRESSES. IN PROTECTING CIVIL LIBERTIES ALSO TREATING THOSE WITH. IT TREATABLE AND ALMOST UNTREATABLE- MENTAL ILLNESSES IN THE MOST HUMANE WAY POSSIBLE. THANK YOU MISTER KALRA THE NETWORKS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I LINE MY EXPERIENCE IS CERTAINLY WITH THE SUMMER CUNNINGHAM- MOVED WHEN I WAS WORKING PUBLIC DEFENDER AND APPEARING MANY TIMES BEFORE A LEGEND- DOCK- JUDGE MANLEY- AND HIS- MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE COURT OF AB OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE COURT- TREATMENT COURT- AND HOW HARD IT WAS. TO BUT WHAT WHEN TO KEEP SOMEONE ON A PLAN- WHEN YOU LOSE TRACK OF THEM OR THERE ISN'T A PLAN OR THERE IS STRICT MONITORING- THAT OCCURS- I ALSO SHARE A LINE MY CONCERNS WITH THE CHAIR- IN TERMS OF. THE OF THE FUNDS ARE BEING USED- FOR INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT HOWEVER- GIVEN THE FACT THAT- YOU- BUT AS THE AUTHOR IN GETTING YOUR SINCERITY ON THIS ISSUE AND THE FACT YOU'VE ALREADY TAKEN AMENDMENTS AT ABOUT A LATE SOME-OF THE CONCERNS. OF THE DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA AND OTHER FOLKS THAT- THAT EXPRESSED CONCERNS I'M CONFIDENT THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK IN IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION ON THIS AND- I'M IM HAPPY TO VOTE FOR TODAY WILL CONTINUE TO. ATTRACT MY TRIP BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR SINCERE CONCERN- ON THE AND WORK ON THIS ISSUE. DOESN'T TAKE ON PROBABLY ONE THE TOUGHEST ISSUES RIGHT NOW FACING OUR CHAIR ON A CALL WITH THEM A LOT OF THE BIG CITY MAYORS WHO. THE WHOLE CONVERSATION FOR AN HOUR WAS ON THIS TOPIC- AND I THINK WE ALL STRUGGLE WITH WHAT WE DO WHAT WHAT WHAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO HERE- AND- I ABSOLUTE OR SEND THE CONCERNS BUT I. DON'T WANT TO SEE THE CONVERSATION MOVED FORWARD. I'M IN OFFICE THE GOVERNOR'S WEIGHING IN THERE'S A LOT OF CONVERSATION ON THIS I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE THE RIGHT ANSWER BUT WHAT I DO KNOW IS THE STATUS QUO IS NOT WORKING. AND SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO BRING FORTH IDEAS TO KEEP PUSHING. AND HAVING SOMEONE COMFORTABLE CALM CONVERSATIONS AND SO IN THAT SENSE I'M- HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL THAT I AM HAPPY TO ALSO BE A THOUGHT PARTNER WITH YOU ON THIS IS THIS MOVES FORWARD BUT- IT'S A TOUGH ONE SO THANK YOU FOR TAKING IT ON. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS ALL RIGHT CNN SANTIAGO YOU MAY CLOSER AND LOOK THIS IS A HEALTHY DEBATE THAT I THINK YOU KNOW THE CONVERSATION ABOUT- AND ACCESS AND HOW WE GET THIS WRONG RIGHT AT THE M. H. S. A. DOLLARS NOW SAVE A FIVE PER SECOND HOW YOU MAY FEEL ABOUT THE DEBATE ON THAT PARTICULAR PIECE OF DOLLARS. BUT IT IS THE LEGISLATIVE PROGNOSTICATORS FOR THAT THAT THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT DEBATE AND WE PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE THAT DEBATE THE REASON WE ARGUED AT THE TIME I'M GONNA GO BY MEMORY SO IF SOMEBODY SAYS I'M ABOUT A COUPLE OF DOLLARS OFF- I'M HAPPY TO CORRECTED ONLINE BUT WHEN WE LOOKED AT WHEN WE ASK FOR THE AUDIT WE ARE NOT EXPECTING TO FIND CERTAIN THINGS. THAT WE DID DURING THAT TIME IN AT THE TIME WE FOUND THAT L. A. COUNTY HAD CLOSE TO A BILLION DOLLARS IN THE FUNDS NOW WHEN THEY'RE AT THE TIME WAS I THINK A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE HUNDRED SIXTY SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE LIVING ON THE STREETS- IN CALIFORNIA AND I THINK IT WAS SIXTY THREE OR SIXTY FIVE THE TIME AGAIN I SAID I'M FUDGING THE NUMBERS A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE I REMEMBER EXACTLY BUT WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT NUMBERS LIKE THAT PEOPLE LIVING ON THE STREETS AND YOU SEE. CLOSE TO A BILLION DOLLARS- IN A BANK ACCOUNT YEAH IT'S TIME TO TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE DOLLARS IN USE IN A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY THAT'S OUR PRODUCT THAT WE SHOULD DO SO BUT BUT I THINK IT'LL I THINK IT'S BEEN SAID IT AT ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES HERE TODAY SAID INSTEAD OF TOLD NOT WORKING I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY'S GONNA ARGUE THAT THAT WHAT THAT THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING ON HOMELESSNESS. IS AS EFFECTIVE IS IT SHOULD BE DAHLE ELEMENTS OF IT THAT WORK VERY WELL OTHER ELEMENTS THAT WE NEED REVIEWS IT DO DIFFERENTLY AND THEN THERE ARE ELEMENTS OF IT IT JUST BROKEN I MEAN WE'VE WE'VE CREATED A VERY GOOD PROGRAMS BUT WE ALSO CREATED BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS OF THE NIGHTMARES THAT HAVE RESULTED IN RESULTS FOR THOSE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE THE DEBATE IS NOT ABOUT CIVIL LIBERTIES. IT'S NOT. MUCH ANY OF. LAWS I'D LIKE TO STEP INTO SOME THOSE CASES IN CERTAIN. CASES I WOULD. BUT THE BUT THE BIG TODAY IS ABOUT. CREATE A VERY SIMPLE COORDINATED PLAN AT THE STATE LEVEL. A VERY SIMPLE COORDINATED PLAN OF THE COUNTY. N. REPORTING MECHANISM BECAUSE IT NO REPORTING IS DONE ON THIS. THAT THAT SATISFIES- OUR QUEST FOR DATA TO CHANGE THE LARGER CONVERSATION AND LAWS. AND YES THE DEBATE IS ABOUT USING THESE DOLLARS DIFFERENTLY- WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND I THINK WE BEGAN TO TALK TO SOME OF THE SUBCOMMITTEES BUT THE TAKE A LOOK AT HOW MUCH OF THESE DOLLARS. ARE REALLY BEING HELD IN FROM THESE ACCOUNTS. AND YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF IS IT GOOD USE. OF THOSE DOLLARS TO BE HELD IN THOSE ACCOUNTS WHEN PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING ON THE STREETS. THE LPS LAWS THAT WERE SET IN PLACE I SUPPORT FOR VERY GOOD REASONS BECAUSE SERVICE APPLAUSE OR SOME PLACE I SUPPORT VERY GOOD REASONS BUT THERE ARE DIFFERENT PLACES AND SPACES. WHAT WE HAVE TO I WOULD ARGUE WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MAYBE IT NEEDS TO CHANGE THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY BUT JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE BROUGHT UP ALL FATE. WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT A PERSON WHO WAS HURT ON THE STREETS. WE TAKE A LOOK AT A PERSON WAS A DANGER TO THEMSELVES OR DANGER TO OTHERS. WE TAKE A LOOK AT A PERSON. WHO IS. PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY. N. AND MENTAL ANGUISH ON THE STREETS. AND THEY CANNOT DETERMINE FOR THEMSELVES TO GO GET CARE. WHAT IS THE HUMANE THING TO DO AND WHAT IS OUR MORE RESPONSIBILITY. AND THAT IS TO PROVIDE THAT PERSON HELP. AND SO SHOULD WE HAVE TO CHANGE SOME OF THE LOCAL AUTHORED BY OPAL PEOPLE ABSOLUTELY. AND FOR PEOPLE WHO ARGUE THAT WE SHOULDN'T I INVITE THEM TO SKID ROW TO TAKE A LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO WERE IN AGONY. BLIT THE BLEEDING PAINS AND IF THIS IS A LUCIEN IS LET'S GO ASK THEM IF THEY NEED HELP. AND THEY SAY NO AND WALK AWAY BECAUSE WE'VE DONE OUR JOB SOMETHING IS VERY BROKEN ABOUT ALL. ABOUT US OUR MORAL COMPASSES IN THE WAY THAT WE DO THIS WORK. THAT'S NOT THE BIG TODAY. BUT IT SHOULD BE SAID BUT THE DEBATE TODAY IS A COORDINATED PLAN FOR AN INDIVIDUAL BEFORE THEY LEAVE. REPORTING ON WHETHER IT'S WORKING OR NOT IN USING DOLLARS THAT ARE THERE TO HELP THOSE WHO ARE MOST IN NEED THAT'S WHAT THE DEBATE IS THAT AND THAT'S WHAT HOPING.
