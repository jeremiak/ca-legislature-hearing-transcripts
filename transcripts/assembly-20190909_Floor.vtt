LOOK AT FRESNO STATE IN THE

FUTURE. BECAUSE OF THE MARKET

05:44:20.373 --> 05:44:21.874
FORCES THAT WILL BE WELL THAT

NOTHING THINK ABOUT IT FOR JUST

05:44:31.784 --> 05:44:34.487
A MINUTE. IT IS THE RECRUITING

05:44:34.553 --> 05:44:38.157
LEVEL FIELD WE PRESENTLY HAVE

05:44:38.224 --> 05:44:40.292
ARE UNABLE STE FRESNO STATE

05:44:40.359 --> 05:44:42.161
QUITE FRANKLY TO BE COMPETITIVE

05:44:42.228 --> 05:44:43.696
WE WERE COMPETITIVE WE WITH U.

05:44:43.763 --> 05:44:45.031
S. C. NOT LONG AGO WE WERE

05:44:45.097 --> 05:44:47.967
COMPETITIVE WITH ABOUT. WITH

05:44:48.034 --> 05:44:52.071
THE MINNESOTA NOT LONG AGO. THE

05:44:52.138 --> 05:44:53.372
CONCERN THAT THAT OUR ATHLETIC

05:44:53.439 --> 05:44:55.775
DIRECTOR HANDS IS A SYMPATHY

05:44:55.841 --> 05:44:59.712
FORCE FOR STUDENTS. A HOPE THAT

05:44:59.779 --> 05:45:01.814
THE NC TWO WAY WILL WORK

05:45:01.881 --> 05:45:06.152
THROUGH THIS. BUT IN THE

05:45:06.218 --> 05:45:06.685
MEANTIME IF THERE IS NOT A

05:45:06.752 --> 05:45:11.323
SIGNIFICANT. FAIRNESS THAT IS

05:45:11.390 --> 05:45:14.226
ALLOCATED IN THIS THERE WILL BE

05:45:14.293 --> 05:45:18.064
A RECRUITING UP. BLOOM WITH

SCHOOLS LIKE FRESNO STATE. I

05:45:21.267 --> 05:45:21.767
WANT TO REITERATE WHY WOULD

05:45:21.834 --> 05:45:26.072
THAT BE. IT WOULD BE BECAUSE

05:45:26.138 --> 05:45:28.941
THE VALUE OF BEING IN A BIG

05:45:29.008 --> 05:45:34.780
MARKET. IN A MEDIA MARKET. WILL

05:45:34.847 --> 05:45:38.084
BE A DISADVANTAGE TO FRESNO

05:45:38.150 --> 05:45:41.887
STATE IN ITS RECRUITING. THE

05:45:41.954 --> 05:45:45.624
CASE IS MADE THAT WELL. THE

05:45:45.691 --> 05:45:47.326
STUDENT ATHLETES WILL HELP YOU

05:45:47.393 --> 05:45:49.295
KNOW CLOSE THE GAP ON SOME OF

05:45:49.361 --> 05:45:50.963
THEIR EXPENSES AND THE LIKE IN

05:45:51.030 --> 05:45:52.665
A SMALLER VERSION OF A OF A

05:45:52.731 --> 05:45:56.769
FREE MARKET. THE FOR THE I

05:45:56.836 --> 05:45:58.871
THINK THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS

05:45:58.938 --> 05:46:01.373
THAT IF A STUDENT ATHLETE FOR

05:46:01.440 --> 05:46:03.676
EXAMPLE WANTED TO BE. HIRED IN

05:46:03.742 --> 05:46:06.712
UTILIZED FOR A SPOKESPERSON FOR

LET'S SAY A CAR DEALERSHIP.

05:46:11.617 --> 05:46:13.185
FRESNO HAS X. NUMBER OF CAR

05:46:13.252 --> 05:46:15.788
DEALERSHIPS THE MARKET PLACE

05:46:15.855 --> 05:46:18.257

05:46:21.127 --> 05:46:23.329
HUGE SMS A STATISTICAL

05:46:23.395 --> 05:46:24.663
MEASURING AREA AND WILL HAVE A

05:46:24.730 --> 05:46:29.635
HUGE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES. THAT

05:46:29.702 --> 05:46:32.304
WILL GO TO STUDENTS EVEN FOR

05:46:32.371 --> 05:46:33.973
WHAT WE CONSIDER TO BE THESE

05:46:34.039 --> 05:46:35.407
THESE SORT OF LESSER THINGS

05:46:35.474 --> 05:46:38.544
LIKE NIKE AND ARE UNDERNEATH

05:46:38.611 --> 05:46:41.814
THE BIG GAP. CONTRACTS THAT

05:46:41.881 --> 05:46:43.048

HERE. AND I'M ASKING YOU TO

05:46:45.718 --> 05:46:46.252
THINK ABOUT IT I'M GOING TO

05:46:46.318 --> 05:46:48.420
HAVE TO LAY OFF ON THIS. BUT I

05:46:48.487 --> 05:46:49.889
THINK WE HAVE TO THINK

05:46:49.955 --> 05:46:51.323
SERIOUSLY ABOUT THIS KIND OF

05:46:51.390 --> 05:46:54.160
CONSEQUENCE WHERE. UNDER

05:46:54.226 --> 05:46:57.863
PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES THERE IS

05:46:57.930 --> 05:46:58.397
SOME DEGREE OF FAIRNESS IN

05:46:58.464 --> 05:47:01.967
RECRUITING. AND OUR RECRUITING

05:47:02.034 --> 05:47:04.937
IS SUCCESSFUL IN PART BECAUSE

05:47:05.004 --> 05:47:07.573
WE HAVE HAD REALLY FANTASTIC

05:47:07.640 --> 05:47:08.707
STUDENTS WHO HAVE COME TO US

05:47:08.774 --> 05:47:10.843
BECAUSE THEY CAN PLAY LIKE

05:47:10.910 --> 05:47:13.646
DEREK CARR AND FIND THEIR WAY.

05:47:13.712 --> 05:47:16.148
INTO BIG CONTRACTS IN THE NFL.

05:47:16.215 --> 05:47:22.054
OUR. EIGHTY OUR BULLDOG

05:47:22.121 --> 05:47:24.890
FOUNDATION AND OTHERS ARE VERY

05:47:24.957 --> 05:47:27.760
VERY CONCERNED THAT IF THIS

05:47:27.826 --> 05:47:31.363
WERE TO BE ESTABLISHED AS THE

05:47:31.430 --> 05:47:33.966
BILL SUGGESTS AN ABSENCE OF THE

05:47:34.033 --> 05:47:36.869
NC TO A AND IT. ENGAGING IN

05:47:36.936 --> 05:47:39.038
THIS AND RECOGNIZING THAT THERE

05:47:39.104 --> 05:47:41.073

DONE A LOT OF HOMEWORK AND IT

05:47:51.650 --> 05:47:53.285
HAD TO COME TO THE CONCLUSION

05:47:53.352 --> 05:47:55.221
THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE

05:47:55.287 --> 05:47:56.555
PICKING SOME WINNERS AND SOME

05:47:56.622 --> 05:47:58.991
LOSERS ACT AS A RESULT OF THE

05:47:59.058 --> 05:48:01.026

DISADVANTAGE SO WITH THAT I'M

05:48:15.874 --> 05:48:17.243
GOING TO LAY OFF I HOPE THAT

TEE SHIRT BUSINESS WITH A

05:58:17.542 --> 05:58:20.078

I AUTHORED AB EIGHT OH NINE

06:07:07.271 --> 06:07:08.740
WHICH CREATES THE REQUIREMENT

06:07:08.806 --> 06:07:10.675
THAT TAX INCREASES THAT VOTERS

06:07:10.742 --> 06:07:12.243

TRYING CLEAN THIS UP BUT

06:07:53.918 --> 06:07:55.019
UNFORTUNATELY THE SPONSORS OF

06:07:55.086 --> 06:07:56.921
THIS BILL REFUSED TO NEGOTIATE

06:07:56.988 --> 06:07:58.689
BECAUSE WHAT THEY REALLY WANT.

06:07:58.756 --> 06:08:00.491
IS TO HIDE FROM VOTERS THE FACT

06:08:00.558 --> 06:08:01.459
THAT THEY'RE VOTING ON A TAX

06:08:01.526 --> 06:08:03.428
INCREASE AND IN FACT THE BILL

06:08:03.494 --> 06:08:04.595
IN FRONT OF YOU WOULD REMOVE

06:08:04.662 --> 06:08:06.297
COMPLETELY OF THE REQUIREMENT.

06:08:06.364 --> 06:08:07.965

06:08:10.902 --> 06:08:13.337
JUST INSERT THE WORDS. SEE

06:08:13.404 --> 06:08:15.606
VOTER GUIDE FOR INFORMATION AND

06:08:15.673 --> 06:08:17.508
WE ALL KNOW THAT MOST VOTERS

06:08:17.575 --> 06:08:19.444
NEVER OPEN THE VOTER GUIDE SO

06:08:19.510 --> 06:08:21.479
THAT IS ESSENTIALLY HIDING FOR

06:08:21.546 --> 06:08:22.079
VOTERS THE FACT THAT THEY'RE

06:08:22.146 --> 06:08:24.215

06:08:39.530 --> 06:08:40.932
TAXES AND SEE VOTER GUIDE. AND

06:08:40.998 --> 06:08:42.099
THEY REJECTED IT BECAUSE WHAT

06:08:42.166 --> 06:08:43.568
THEY REALLY WANT TO DO IS HIDE

06:08:43.634 --> 06:08:44.168
THE FACT IT'S A TAX INCREASE

06:08:44.235 --> 06:08:45.870

GOING TO INCREASE YOUR TAXES.

06:10:58.069 --> 06:11:01.038

TO SCARE PEOPLE IN VOTING NO.

06:11:16.754 --> 06:11:18.522
ON A MEASURE THAT WOULD.

06:11:18.589 --> 06:11:20.224
ACTUALLY BE TO THEIR BENEFIT

06:11:20.291 --> 06:11:22.927
THAT THEY MAY NOT BE PAYING.

06:11:22.994 --> 06:11:24.428

CALCULATE FOR THEMSELVES WHAT

06:11:37.508 --> 06:11:40.311
THEIR TAX MAY OR MAY NOT BE. IS

06:11:40.378 --> 06:11:43.514
MISLEADING WHAT'S MISLEADING IS

06:11:43.581 --> 06:11:44.849
TRYING TO FORCE JURISDICTIONS

06:11:44.915 --> 06:11:46.584

SEVENTY FIVE WORDS THAT IS

06:11:50.021 --> 06:11:51.956
GOING TO LEAD A VOTER TO THE
