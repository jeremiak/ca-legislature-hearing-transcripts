ESSENTIAL NONEXISTENCE OF OF IT

00:59:14.717 --> 00:59:16.619

THAT CARE FOR THEM.

00:59:26.229 --> 00:59:27.864
AND IT'S CRISIS BY HSS WORKERS

00:59:27.931 --> 00:59:28.898
AND OTHERS THAT ARE THE

00:59:28.965 --> 00:59:34.304

CARE TAKERS -- AS WELL.

00:59:38.641 --> 00:59:40.209
AS THOSE THAT ARE RECEIVING THE

00:59:40.276 --> 00:59:41.911
CARE -- OUR BRUCE LITERALLY

00:59:41.978 --> 00:59:43.146
SAVING THE STATE BILLIONS OF

00:59:43.212 --> 00:59:44.580
DOLLARS A YEAR BY PUTTING UP

00:59:44.647 --> 00:59:45.548
THEIR OWN MONEY OR BY

00:59:45.615 --> 00:59:47.083
SACRIFICING.

00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:48.885
OR BY GOING WITHOUT.

00:59:48.952 --> 00:59:51.220
A AND SO.

00:59:51.287 --> 00:59:53.022
THE SYSTEMS UNSUSTAINABLE

00:59:53.089 --> 00:59:54.490
BECAUSE WE CAN'T EXPECT.

00:59:54.557 --> 00:59:56.392
THOSE THAT RECEIVE THE CARE AND

00:59:56.459 --> 00:59:59.262
PROVIDE THE CARE TO CONTINUE TO

00:59:59.329 --> 01:00:00.296
GO ON THIS WAY.

01:00:00.363 --> 01:00:02.131
AND SO THAT'S WHY THIS IS SO

01:00:02.198 --> 01:00:03.366
IMPORTANT.

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:05.101
SO THAT WE CAN TRULY CREATE A

01:00:05.168 --> 01:00:07.070
PATH FORWARD THAT COULD THAT

01:00:07.136 --> 01:00:09.038
SUSTAINABLE THAT RESPECTS THOSE

01:00:09.105 --> 01:00:10.606
THAT ARE RECEIVING THE CARE AS

01:00:10.673 --> 01:00:12.241
WELL AS THOSE PROVIDING THE CARE.

01:00:12.308 --> 01:00:14.344
AND THAT ULTIMATELY -- MIGHT

01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:16.012
REALLY SAVES THE STATE --

01:00:16.079 --> 01:00:18.915
BECAUSE THE STATE THAT A IS NOT

01:00:18.982 --> 01:00:22.051
ONLY -- SUSTAINING IN ABLE TO

01:00:22.118 --> 01:00:25.221
SUSTAIN -- THE CURRENT A MODEL

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:27.724
OF ON THE BACKS OF SO MANY BUT

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:28.858
ALSO IN THE STATE'S GOING TO

01:00:28.925 --> 01:00:31.160
COLLAPSE UNDER UNDER THE WEIGHT

01:00:31.227 --> 01:00:31.761
OF THE OF THE BURDENS OF THE

01:00:31.828 --> 01:00:32.962
NEEDS.

01:00:33.029 --> 01:00:34.330
PARTICULARLY WITH THE WITH THE

01:00:34.397 --> 01:00:35.665
GROWING CERTAINLY THE GROWING

01:00:35.732 --> 01:00:37.367
ELDERLY POPULATION AND THOSE

01:00:37.433 --> 01:00:38.501
THAT HAVE THE NEEDS.

01:00:38.568 --> 01:00:41.838
BUT EVEN IF WE WERE JUST TO STAY

01:00:41.904 --> 01:00:43.373
STATUS QUO IN TERMS OF NUMBERS

01:00:43.439 --> 01:00:44.874
IT'S JUST UNSUSTAINABLE SYSTEM.

01:00:44.941 --> 01:00:46.809
AND SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY

01:00:46.876 --> 01:00:48.177
FOR US TO TRULY MOVE FORWARD --

01:00:48.244 --> 01:00:50.079
BUT I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT

01:00:50.146 --> 01:00:51.581
OPPORTUNITY TO CHALLENGE THAT

01:00:51.647 --> 01:00:53.316
DOES PROVIDES PROVIDE SOME HOPE

01:00:53.383 --> 01:00:55.952
AND SOME -- SOME EXCITEMENT --

01:00:56.019 --> 01:00:56.352
