I'M HERE JUST TO ANSWER QUESTIONS BRANDON PROVIDE AT THAT OVER HERE SO I'M JUST HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SONYA PADDOCK WITH THE L. L. HEY DOCTOR EMILY THIS IS SONYA PEDIG- YEAH DR IMPLY IN MEMBERS THIS IS WHEN YOU PICK FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. I BELIEVE YOU THE PROPOSAL AND HAVE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE ESTIMATED COSTS AND TYPES OF ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE BEEN AND ARE CURRENTLY BEING UNDERTAKEN BY THE DEPARTMENT IN RESPONSE TO COVER THE ENACTED- TO. TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET AS SOON THAT COKE IT WOULD BE RAINING BY THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR. AND THAT THE QUOTE FROM VERY YOU CREATED SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND UNPLANNED COSTS. ALSO PREDICTED REQUEST THESE EXPENDITURES AS OPPOSED TO THE NOTIFICATION PROCESS OF THE PAST IS THIS INCREASES LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT CONCERNS ABOUT FOR EARLY ACTION REQUEST IN ADDITION I WOULD MENTION THAT WE DO NOT HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE OTHER ITEMS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH BUDGET IN THE EARLY ACTION REQUEST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WITH THAT I WILL BRING THAT BACK TO THE DYESS AND SEE IF ANY MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS SAYING NON I WILL KEEP IT HERE AT THE CHAIR- FIRST ALL BEGIN WITH- DOCTOR ERAGON- I KNOW THAT- SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC THAT YOU HAVE BEEN A STALWART CHAMPION FOR. OUR STATE AND ADVOCATING FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND WANTS TO MAKE SURE TO APPRECIATE AND- UP LEFT MUCH OF THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE- THROUGHOUT THIS PASTYEAR BUT BUT I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN FOR US TO HAVE A CONVERSATION AS WE ARE. NEARING THE TWO YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF DECLARING A STATE OF EMERGENCY FOR CALIFORNIA FOR US TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THE SCIENCE WOULD TELL US AND DICTATE TOWARDS WHICH METRICS WE WOULD LOOK AT TO WORK CONSIDER AS CRITERIA FOR US IS THE STATE TO LEAVE THE STATE OF EMERGENCY AND I'M HOPING YOU CAN COMMENT AS TO WHAT THE SCIENCE- WILL- STATES FOR. US AS A STATE. YEAH I'LL MAKE A FEW COMMENTS I WANNA MAKE SURE CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES SIR MUCH BETTER THANK YOU. TRAFFIC OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH SO I YOU KNOW ALL OF US ALL OF US HAVE LEARNED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF IT THERE THE- THE FIRST COPY TO- THE AGENT THAT CAUSES THAT THE COUPLE BECOMING NINETEEN PANDEMIC KEPT REALLY THROWING US SOME CURVEBALLS IF WE REMEMBER. AFTER JUNE FIFTEENTH WE ARE COMING OUT WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO DO REALLY WELL THEN THE DELTA VARIANCE CAME. WITH ALL DIFFERENT WAS MORE VIRULENT AND IT WAS MORE TRANSMISSIBLE. THEN THE- MAKRAN VARYING CAME. ACROSS VERY WAS DIFFERENT IT WAS LESS RELIANT COSTLESS DISEASE BUT IT HAD A MUNIS CAPE THAT MEANS PEOPLE WHO ARE VACCINATED OR HAD PRIOR INFECTION IS ABLE TO OVERCOME OVERCOME THAT HAND IT WAS. INCREDIBLY INFECTIOUS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LEARNING MOVING FORWARD IS. BECAUSE MOST TRANSMISSION HAPPENS. WHEN PEOPLE ARE A SYMPTOMATIC. THE FOR THE VIRUS THE THOUGHT HAVE AN EVOLUTIONARY REASON FOR IT TO BECOME LESS VIRULENT OVERTIME. WE HAVE SO MUCH TRANSITION HAPPENING ALL OVER THE WORLD THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE FACING NEW VARIANTS SOME OF THEM MAY HAVE SOME OF AND HOW HOW THEY'RE VERY IT PRESENTS ITSELF IT MAY BECOME MORE VIRULENT MORE TALK MORE TRANSMISSIBLE AND MAY HAVE REPORTED MEAN ESCAPE. SO WE'RE REALLY FOCUSING ON RIGHT NOW. MR HALF COURT INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT WE HAVE GOOD SURVEILLANCE AND TO RESPOND TO ANY ADDITIONAL VARIANTS THAT COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY HAD. BOB AND I WERE HOPING THAT IN THE COMING IN THE COMING WEEKS I HAVE A COUPLE OF MONTHS WILL BE ABLE TO REALLY GET A BETTER FEEL FOR HOW THIS IS GOING TO PLAY OUT. IT IT'S SO HARD TO PREDICT RIGHT NOW WITH RESPECT TO THE- DICK DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO GO BACK AND SPEAK TO- ADMIT. THE MINISTRATION AND GET GET MORE INPUT FROM THEM. I'M I YOU FOR THAT DOCTOR ARE GONE AND BELIEVE IT'S A NECESSARY CONVERSATION FOR US TO HAVE AS- AN INSTITUTION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE- PROTECTING IN DOING OUR DUE DILIGENCE IN OVERSIGHT. WHILE I'M VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE ADMINISTRATION RUNNING THIS BILL THROUGH THE NORMAL. PROCESS I BELIEVE THE STATE OF EMERGENCY ALLOWED YOU AND GAVE YOU EXTRA POWERS TO BE ABLE TO. RUN IT THROUGH THE JAIL BC OR ANOTHER PROCESS. AND SO I'D LIKE TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE SPECIFIC CRITERIA AND METRICS THAT WERE ANALYZING TO DETERMINE WHEN. WE WILL. BE ABLE TO LEAVE THE STATE OF EMERGENCY. AS I BELIEVE THAT WILL RESTORE AND CREATE THE RIGHT BALANCE THAT WE NEED BETWEEN OUR BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. AND ALLOW US TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY OVERSIGHT FOR THE ITEMS THAT WE ARE SPEAKING ABOUT TODAY. BUT I'M HAPPY TO- FOLLOW UP IN MORE DISCUSSIONS. YES I'LL I'LL I WILL I WILL ABSOLUTELY TAKE I'LL ACTUALLY TAKE THAT BACK WE ARE WORKING ON METRICS AND WE'LL TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT'S CONNECTING TO THE QUESTION THAT YOU'RE ASKING. I'M I'M GONNA FOLLOW UP WITH TO SPECIFIC QUESTIONS WITHIN THE PROPOSAL'S AYE I WILL START BY- APPRECIATING THE ADMINISTRATION FOR- THE C. R. D. P. FIXES THESE WERE- ITEMS THAT DIDN'T NEED TO BE IMPROVED FROM THE TWENTY ONE BUDGET AND I'M VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THAT. BUT I WANTED TO FOCUS MY QUESTIONS TODAY ON SEARCH STAFFING AS WELL AS THE APIO TV. AMBULANCE PATIENT. OFFLOAD TIME. T. AND I'M HOPING TO FIRST TALK ABOUT THE SURGE STAFFING. SO FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SIX MILLION FOR THE STATE DOESN'T HELP US WITH ANY CLARITY TOWARDS WHETHER THERE'S ANY PATTERNS THAT WERE NOTICING. WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN IDENTIFY THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN REGIONS OF OUR STATE THAT MAY BE REQUIRING MORE SURGE STAFFING AND AS WE ARE. MAKING FUTURE DECISIONS AYE I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND WHERE OUR CURRENT FUNDING IS GOING TO SUPPORT THAT SURGE STAFFING AND I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN FOLLOW UP AND UNDERSTAND- THAT AS WE ARE SPENDING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AND WORK FORCE THIS YEAR. WE BELIEVE IF THERE'S A PATTERN THAT'S IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE SEARCH STAFFING AND THE PANDEMIC THAT SHOULD HELP TO INFORM OUR FUTURE FUNDING DECISIONS AND I'M HOPING THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE SOME CLARITY REGARDING SEARCH STAFF- THIS PRESIDENT BENEFIT ACTING DIRECT OF IN THE CENTER- IT'S PER MAKES COMMENTS PERFECT. THANK YOU SO MUCH ANGER- SO JUST ANSWER QUESTION I THINK THAT'S A THAT'S THAT'S EXCELLENT AND I THINK AS WE FROM- FORD IN THIS RESPONSE WE ARE STARTING NOW TO TRY TO IDENTIFY SOME OF THESE PATTERNS. FOR EXAMPLE NORMALLY ONE REGION IN THE STATE AS DEFINED BY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER REGION NORMALLY SEE SOME INCREASE IN SEARCH MAYBE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VETERANS COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION IS ELEVATED WE SEE THAT- TRANSMISSION OF KERR AND OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE AND CONTINUE TO SUPPORT. OUR AND END UP SUPPORTING HOLISTICALLY THROUGHOUT THE STATE I WILL SAY THAT. CURRENTLY WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR MEDICAL RESOURCES ACROSS THE STATE THERE IS NOT NECESSARILY ONE PARTICULAR REGION THAT IS MORE HEAVILY SUPPORTED THAN ANOTHER HOWEVER THE VERY FAR PART OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA DOES SEEM TO SEAT AT SOMETIMES A LOT OF SUPPORT AND THAT- THEIR HOSPITALS MAY NOT BE AS IMPACTED- OR OR- THEY MAY JUST NEED THE LAST. HELP IN THIS AREA BUT I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY SOMETHING TO TAKE BACK TO INFORM FUTURE FUNDING DECISIONS SO THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY THESE PATTERNS AND TARGET INTERVENTIONS. PROACTIVELY CONTINUE TO. THANK YOU FOR MUCH I'M I WILL. OUT TO THE P. O. T. AND- OF. I WILL SY THAT- JUST AS A REMINDER I SPENT TEN YEARS IN THE ER AND THE ABILITY FOR OUR FIRST RESPONDERS ARE PARAMEDICS HE AMASSED TO BE ABLE TO OFFLOAD THE PATIENTS WHO THEY PICK UP IN THE FIELD AND TRANSFER RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PERSONNEL WITHIN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT IS AN IMPORTANT PROCESS AND SO I'M LOOKING AT THE AGENDA ON PAGE THIRTEEN FROM CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION URGING THE LEGISLATURE TO. LOOK TOWARDS DEPLOYING ADDITIONAL A POT TEAMS OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. TO ENSURE THAT ALL PATIENTS GET THE EMERGENCY CARE THEY NEED AND I'M HOPING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION CAN COMMENT. ON WHETHER OR NOT THE STATE SHOULD PROVIDE THESE ADDITIONAL TEAMS OVER THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS. SORRY I WILL ALSO JUMP. WELL I'M SO YOU KNOW CURRENTLY WE HAVE A- SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ANTICIPATION OFFLOAD TEAMS SUPPORTING FACILITIES ACROSS THE STATE WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY NEEDS AND HOSPITALS THAT ARE STRUGGLING OR EMS SYSTEMS THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO OFFLOAD THE PATIENT AND DO THE TRANSFER CARE WITH IN A TIMELY MANNER TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT WITH EITHER AN AMBULANCE PATIENT OFFLOAD TEAM AND OR SOME LEVEL- THERE ARE MANY IN TLV IN SUPPORT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN RETURN TO AMBULANCES. BACK TO THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM TO RESPOND TO CALLS. WHAT DO YOU LIKE. THE WHAT DO YOU ANTICIPATE TO SEE WITHIN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS AND PATIENT ACCESS TO EMERGENCY CARE IF WE WERE TO ADOPT THIS REQUEST. I MEAN I THINK ANYTHING THAT THAT WORDS CAN TAKE YOU TO SUPPORT THE TRANSFER CARE FROM THE AMBULANCE- SYSTEM A FOR ME IN MY SYSTEM TO THE HOSPITAL ARE ALL THINGS OF THAT THAT WE WANT TO DO BUT I THINK LOOKING AT THE CONTINUUM OF CARE HOLISTICALLY AND- THE THROUGHPUT OF PATIENTS THROUGH THE ENTIRE HOSPITAL SYSTEM NOT ONLY UP TO THE FLOOR. DISCHARGERS ON THROUGH THE OUT OF THE BACK. DOOR OF THE HOSPITAL ALL REMAIN IMPORTANT ASPECT TO LOOK AT FOR THE PATIENT. I'M A- I AGREE AND- DO BELIEVE THE QUESTION WAS MEANT TO- SHOW THE- BY ALL LOADING THE PATIENTS IN ALLOWING R. E. M. PERSONNEL TO GET. OUT INTO THE FIELD TO. DO THEIR- TO DO THEIR AS FIRST RESP. WOULD BETTER. ACCESS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND IS A BETTER USE OF THEIR TIME AND WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE US TO. MAKE SURE WE'RE LOOKING AT- THESE TEAMS AS THE NECESSARY GREASE TO KEEP OUR SYSTEM FLOWING AND- PATIENTS IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND SO- I'LL LEAVE IT THERE IS A- WOULD BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH MORE DETAILS AND- TO HEAR FROM- THE HOSPITAL'S ON. WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS IMPROVING. BUT NO THAT IT DRAMATICALLY AFFECTS RURAL AREAS LIKE MINE IF HOSPITALS. ARE TIED IN OR IF THE AMBULANCES ARE. STATIONED AT HOSPITALS FOR HOURS WHEN THEY COULD HAVE BEEN OFFLOADING AND BACK OUT INTO THE FIELD AND SO- WITH THAT I WILL ASK MY FINAL QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- REGARDING THE ONE POINT SIX BILLION IN COVERT COSTS DO YOU ANTICIPATE WHAT PORTION OF THIS WILL BE REIMBURSED BY FEMA. SOME OF THE TELL WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M UP THIS TIME YOU KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN TAKE BACK. RIGHT NOW I THINK THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS EVEN THOUGH WE UNDERSTAND THAT CERTAIN ACTIVITIES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FEMA REIMBURSEMENT. UNTIL THE CLAIMS ARE SUBMITTED AND PAYMENT PROCESSES ARE CLAIMS AND ACTUALLY PROVIDES EMBARRASSMENTS. WE CANNOT THE- FULLY UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT EXACTLY WILL BE REIMBURSED BUT I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN TAKE BACK. AND PROVIDE SOME HIGH LEVEL DATA ABOUT WHAT HAS BEEN SUBMITTED AND SORT OF WHAT WE WERE THINKING AT THIS TIME MIGHT BE REIMBURSED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITHOUT IT WILL LOOK FOR MEMBERS FOR ANY FINAL QUESTIONS THE NON. I WILL THANK VERY MUCH PANEL ONE AND WE'LL MOVE ON THE PANEL TO ON THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY. WE WILL HAVE THREE PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL. FIRST DIRECTOR ELIZABETH LANDSBERG AND THE CHIEF COUNSEL RYAN BUCKLEY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND INFORMATION. AND COREY HARSHA WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE LET'S BEGIN WITH DIRECTOR LANCE BURKE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS HELLO FLANSBURGH I'M THE DIRECTOR OF H. PRICE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND INFORMATION FORMERLY OFFENSE. THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE FOR IS ONCE AGAIN INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO GETTING IT OVER THE FINISH LINE THIS YEAR. WE PUBLIC TO TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE LAST WEEK AND I HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE OVERVIEW OF THE POST OFFICE WE I WILL REVIEW THAT MAJOR CHANGES IN THE TRAILER BILL FROM LAST YEAR TO THIS YEAR. AND THEN WILL RESPOND TO QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ASKED. ONE OF KNOWLEDGE THE DOCTOR WOULD HAS BEEN A CRITICAL PARTNER. ON AND CHAMPION OF THE OFFICE HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY WOULD AND HIS OFFICE ON THE PROPOSAL AND ENGAGING WITH STAKEHOLDERS. FEW WOULD DISAGREE THAT HIGH HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA. WELL THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION JUST TWO WEEKS AGO RELEASED THEIR HEALTH POLICY SURVEY IN WHICH 83% OF CALIFORNIANS INTERVIEWED SAID IT WAS EXTREMELY OR VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE WORK ON MAKING HEALTHCARE MORE AFFORDABLE. HEALTH OUR- AS NOTED IN THE ENGINE OF NUMBER OF OTHER FAITHS HAVE SIMILAR OFFICES- IN CALIFORNIA'S TIME HAS COME I THINK WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN ADVANTAGED BY THE FACT SOME OTHER STATES HAVE ADOPTED. SIMILAR OFFICES BUT WHAT WE'VE DONE IN OUR PROPOSAL OUR PROPOSED CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY IS TO TAKE THE BAIT BEST ELEMENTS WITH STATE OF ALL THE SECRETIVE TAKING MEASURES AND PUT OUR UNIQUE CALIFORNIA'S BEEN ON IT- AND ALSO SCALED UP FIXING. CALIFORNIA'S FIVE. THE FOR OFFICE OF HEALTH FOR. WITH ANIL THE HEALTH MARK FOR COST AND THE DRIVERS OF. WOULD ENFORCE COSTS SET BY AND YOU HEALTH OFF. HEALTHCARE FOR. AND WOULD MEASURE KEY INDICATE WHEN WE ARE VALUE SYSTEMS. THE OFFICE WOULD FOR INCREASE PUBLIC. ON TOTAL HEALTH CARE SPENDING IN THE STATE. THE OFFICE WOULD REQUIRE REPORTING OF TOTAL HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURE DATA BROKEN DOWN BY SERVICE CATEGORIES WE KNOW HOW MUCH IT SPENT ON HEALTHCARE HOW MUCH WAS SPENT ON SERVICES RESTRICTIONS DRUGS THE LIFE. IT WOULD BE SUPPLEMENTED WITH FINANCIAL REPORTS FROM. GRANULAR CLAIMS DATA FROM OUR HEALTH CARE PAYMENT STATUS. THE OFFICE WITH PUBLISHED IN IN YOUR FOR IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PUBLIC MEETING ON HEALTHCARE SPENDING TRENDS UNDERLYING FACTORS ALONG WITH POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TO CONTROL COSTS AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND EQUITY OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FUNDS LAST. THE LANGUAGE ESTABLISHES THE HEALTHCARE AFFORDABILITY BOARD WHICH WOULD SET AN OVERALL STATEWIDE COST TARGET AS WELL PACIFIC SECTOR TARGETS- AS WELL AS REGIONAL TARGETS. I'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THE SPECIFIC MAKEUP OF THE BOARD AND THE ACTIVITIES WHEN I GO THROUGH THE CHANGES WITH THIS YEAR'S TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. THE OFFICE IMPORTANTLY WILL ENFORCE COMPLIANCE WITH THE COST TARGETS I'M TAKING A PROGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT APPROACH WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT MORE- UNDER THE QUESTIONS. THE OFFICE BUT ALSO PROMOTE AND BETTER QUALITY IN EQUITY THROUGH PERFORMANCE FOR PARKING. WE WANT TO BE SURE TO AVOID UNANTICIPATED CONSEQUENCES THAT COULD RESULT FROM FOCUSING ON COST ALONE SO PERFORMANCE ON QUALITY IN EQUITY MEASURES WILL BE. YOUR TO GUARD AGAINST NEGATIVE IMPACTS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE TO BUILD ON THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE BY OUR SISTER DEPARTMENTS SO WE WILL LEVERAGE QUALITY IN EQUITY METRICS BEING DEVELOPED RIGHT NOW BY THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE. AS WELL AS THOSE USED BY THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES AND COVERED CALIFORNIA THE DECREASE ADVOCATION OF HALFORDS. THE BOARD WILL SET A STATEWIDE GOAL FOR ADOPTION OF ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODELS TO PROMOTE SHIFTING PAYMENTS AWAY FROM FEE FOR SERVICE. PAYMENTS THE PAYMENTS OF ALL OUR HIGH QUALITY AND COST EFFICIENT CARE. THE OFFICE WILL MEASURE PROGRESS TOWARDS THE GOAL AND IT STANDARDS FOR ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODELS. OUR OFFICE WILL ALSO MEASURE AND PROMOTED SUSTAIN SYSTEM WIDE INVESTMENT PRIMARY CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. INTEGRATE PRIMARY CARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE ACCESS AND HEALTH HEALTH OUTCOMES AS WELL AS REDUCING COSTS. SO THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY WOULD MEASURE THE PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES SPENT ON PRIMARY CARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- AND WHAT IT SPENDING BENCHMARKS AND MEASURES TOWARD THOSE BENCHMARKS IN FUTURE YEARS. THE OFFICE FULL MY AND ADDRESS HEALTHCARE STABILITY COLLECTING DATA AND ANALYZING CHANGES TO THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE TO AVOID HARMFUL REDUCTIONS TO THE WORK FORCE FEED THE CALIFORNIA. AND THEN FINALLY THE OFFICE WOULD REVIEW THE PROPOSED HEALTHCARE CONSOLIDATIONS GIVEN THAT CAN BE A SIGNIFICANT DRIVER OF COST. THE OFFICE FOR INCREASED PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY. TRANSACTION THAT MAY IMPACT MARKET COMPETITION BY REVIEWING MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS NOT CURRENTLY REVIEWED BY ANOTHER GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY. THAT IT IS THE IS THE HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE OFFENSE- AND THEN QUESTION ONE ASKS ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES BETWEEN THIS YEAR'S AND LAST YEAR'S A PROPOSED TRAILER BILL. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS WORKED HAND IN HAND WITH DOCTOR WOULD ALSO HAD SIGNIFICANT CONVERSATIONS WITH DR PANTS AS WELL AS BEEN CONVERSATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON THE LANGUAGE AND SO WE HAVE TO MAKE SOME CHANGES IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE- IN RESPONSE TO THE THAT STAKEHOLDER INPUT. THE WALKER THROUGH THE MORE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES. FIRST ON THE BOARD SO LAST YEAR'S LANGUAGE WE HAD MORE OF AN ADVISORY BOARD AND THIS YEAR LANGUAGES DOUBLES AS A HEALTHCARE AFFORDABILITY BOARD. WHICH WILL SIT KEEP POLICIES INCLUDING ESTABLISHING THE COST TARGETS THEMSELVES. AS WELL AS THE METHODOLOGY FOR SETTING TARGETS AND FACTORS TO MODIFY THOSE TARGETS WHEN APPROPRIATE. IT WILL HELP SET TRACTORS FOR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND THE SCOPE AND RANGE OF ANY ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES. THE BOARD WILL ALSO APPROVE THE BENCHMARKS FOR PRIMARY CARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SPEND. GOAL WITH THE ADOPTION OF ALTERNATIVE WORK PAYMENT MODELS AND STANDARDS TO ADVANCE THE. STABILITY OF THE HEALTH WORKFORCE. THE YEAR'S LANGUAGE HAS AN EIGHT MEMBER. WITH VOTING MEMBERS SO THERE WOULD BE FAR GOVERNOR'S APPOINTMENT SUBJECT TO SENATE CONFIRMATION. ONE APPOINTMENT EACH BY THE ASSEMBLY SPEAKER AND THE SENATE RULES COMMITTEE. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY OR THEIR DESIGNEES WOULD BE A VOTING MEMBER AND THEN THE CALPERS CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OR THEY'RE DEFINITELY WOULD WOULD SERVE AS A NON VOTING MEMBER- I NEXT WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT WE MADE IN TERMS OF THE HEALTHCARE COSTS PARK IT. THE TARGET FOR DEFINED AS THE FIRST TARGET PERCENTAGE FOR ANNUAL INCREASE IN PER CAPITA TOTAL HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES SO FOR EXAMPLE TAKING A CONCRETE EXAMPLE. OF MASSACHUSETTS AT THEIR COST TARGET RATE AT THREE POINT 6% FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS- IN THIS YEAR'S MODEL WHICH COSTS FAR GETS CANNOT REQUIRED DECREASING COSTS. ONLY FOR A GROWTH RATE AND THAT WAS A CHANGE FROM LAST YEAR IN RESPONSE TO CONCERNS. RAISED HOSPITALS. ANOTHER NEW PREVENTION IN LANGUAGE ADDRESSES THE IMPACT OF LABOR COSTS ON THE TARGETS. THE NEW LANGUAGE COST MARKETS CAN BE ADJUSTED FOR A PROVIDER DELIVERY SYSTEM IF THEY THAT NOT SUPERVISORY EMPLOYEE LABOR COSTS ARE PROJECTED TO GROW FASTER THAN THE RATE OF ANY APPLICABLES COST TARGETS. BECAUSE FORGET WILL ALSO BE DEVELOPED BASED ONTHE METHODOLOGYWHICH WILL BE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE FROM BOTH TECHNOLOGY OF THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE AND MAINTAIN FEDERAL FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION. NEXT I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW CHANGES TO THE DEFINITION SECTION- OF THE LANGUAGE. THE DEFINITION OF HEALTH CARE ENTITY- CHANGE FROM PAYER OR PROVIDER TO INCLUDE FULLY INTEGRATED DELIVERY SYSTEM AND- WEHAVE FULLY- MORE FULLY DEFINED THAT THE FULLY INTEGRATED DELIVERY SYSTEM. TOTAL HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES ARE ALSO FURTHER DEFINED IN UP TO INCLUDE EXAMPLES OF NON NAMESPACE PAYMENTS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE TRULY GET AT TOTAL HEALTH CARE COST. IT TERMS OF PHYSICIAN ORGANIZATIONS WE DO HAVE A- UPDATED DEFINITION OF SUCH ORGANIZATIONS THEY STILL LOOK GOOD OUR RISK BEARING ORGANIZATIONS I- INDEPENDENT PHYSICIAN ASSOCIATIONS. AND THEN WE HAVE SET SOME NUMERIC- CUT OFFS IN TERMS OF WITH PHYSICIAN ORGANIZATIONS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE COST TARGET AND BE SUBJECT TO THE DATA SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS SO MEDICAL GROUPS WITH SIXTY OR MORE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. FORTY OR MORE SPECIALISTS OR FOR PRACTICES THAT HAVE A COMBINED. SPECIALTY AND PRIMARY CARE PRACTICE THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED SO THOSE WOULD BE THAT THE SOX CUT OFFS IN TERMS OF WHICH GROUPS WOULD BE SEPARATE COST TARGETS. IN TERMS OF DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING THE OFFICE WILL NOT COLLECT DATA FROM EXACT PROVIDERS INCLUDING SMALL PROVIDER GROUPS. THE OFFICE THERE THERE'S SEVERAL PROVISIONS OF THE LANGUAGE- ABOUT THE OFFICE COLLECTED FROM OTHER STATE AGENCIES THROUGH DATA SHARING AGREEMENTS AND WE ANTICIPATE SIGNIFICANT DATA SHARING PARTICULARLY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE. THERE WAS A CONCERN. SINCERELY HAVE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SO WE VERIFIED THAT THOSE ORGANIZATIONS THAT DON'T- HAVE I DID FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MAY SUBMIT A FINANCIAL STATEMENT THAT INCLUDES- TALK ABOUT A NEW WALK UP COSTS RECEIVE AND LYFT. EITHER A FEW CHANGES WE NEED TO MONITORING COMPLIANCE RENAMED CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS TO PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PLAN WHICH I THINK IS A BETTER NAME TO RELEASING FIVE THE PROGRESSIVE AND COLLABORATIVE APPROACH ON FORSMAN- AND AGAIN I'LL TALK LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE ENFORCEMENT APPROACH. YOU KNOW THAT SO THAT WAS THE END TO QUESTION ONE STRIKE CONTINUES THE REST OF THE QUESTIONS MISTER CHAIR YES PLEASE DR. OKAY SO THE-NEXT QUESTION **** TO RESPOND TO THE CONCERNS RAISED RAISED BY HOSPITALS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDER CONCERNS- THAT WE'RE AWARE OF SO I WANTED TO START- WE HAVE GOTTEN- CONCERNS RAISED BY THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AND THE- CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION- WE REVIEW THE BED AND BUT OF COURSE. WE WOULD NOTE THAT THESE CONCERNS WERE BASED ON LAST YEAR'S TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE- BEFORE WE HAD POSTED THIS YEAR'S LANGUAGE BILL LANGUAGE REFLECTS CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THE INPUT FROM ALL STAKEHOLDERS- AND WE DO THINK WE HAVE STE WE BELIEVE WE'VE GOT A LANGUAGE STRIKES A CAREFUL BALANCE. BETWEEN ENSURING THAT WE'RE MEETING OUR FUNCTIONS OF THE OFFICE AND ADDRESSING THE ISSUES RAISED BY STAKEHOLDERS. THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATIONS- URGE THAT NO HEALTHCARE ENTITIES SHOULD BE HEALTH OF A SPECIAL STANDARD OR OR A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY. FOR THEIR PART OF THE ASSOCIATION OF HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS HAVE RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT COST TARGETS THAT TAKE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH AND MAY NOT BE ACHIEVABLE FOR SMALL RURAL CRITICAL ACCESS FACILITIES THE PRINCIPLE OF ALL AND AS WELL AS THE NEED FOR SOME VERY ABILITY AND INDIVIDUALIZED DETERMINATIONS. I APOLOGIZE THAT THE MAILBOX WAS HERE. ALL RIGHT- SO THE OFFICE WILL ABSOLUTELY START WITH AN ALL IN APPROACH IN TERMS OF DATA COLLECTION AND THE TOTAL COST OF CARE CALCULATION- WILL INCLUDE DATA FROM ALL SECTORS OF THE HEALTH CARE ENOUGH. TO TRULY UNDERSTAND THE FULL PICTURE OF HEALTHCARE COSTS THIS ALL AND APPROACHES HE AND I THINK THERE'S BROAD STAKEHOLDER AGREEMENT ABOUT THAT. BUT THEN THERE ARE ANUMBER OF PLACES WHERE A MORE NUANCED APPROACH- INDIVIDUALIZED APPROACH IS WARRANTED. THE TRAILER BOAT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE REQUIRES USE OF A RISK ADJUSTMENT METHODOLOGY FOR THE COST MARKETS THAT WE THINK ADDRESSES SOME OF THE HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS WHOSE ARMS. ARTICLE THREE OF THE BILL SETS FORTH THE PROCESS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR THE COST TARGETS AND ALLOWS THE BOARD SPECIFICALLY TO ADJUST COST MARKETS WHEN WARRANTED. TO ACCOUNT FOR THE BASELINE COST ADDITIONALLY WHEN IT COMES TO ADJUSTING TARGETS THE OFFICE WILL SOMETIMES HAVE TO LOOK AT INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND THERE IS A PROCESS FOR THAT. A PARTICULAR ENTITY DOESN'T MEET THE COST TARGET WOULD MEET WITH THE OFFICE AND PROVIDE DATA EXPLAINING THE COST OVERRUN SO WE COULD ENVISION THAT BEING- HIGHER RATES PAID DUE TO A SCARCITY OF A PARTICULAR KIND OF SPECIALIST. A SICKER PATIENT POPULATION FOUR INVESTMENT IN A CARE MANAGEMENT OR OR ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD I. T. SYSTEM. THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE REQUIRES THE OFFICE IN EVALUATING WHETHER AN ENTITY COMPLIED WITH THE COST TARGET TO CONSIDER EACH ENTITY'S CONTRIBUTION TO GROWTH TO COST GROWTH IN EXCESS OF THE APPLE PARK IT. ACTORS THE CONTRIBUTE TO SPENDING IN EXCESS OF THE TARGET AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH EACH ENTITY HAS CONTROL OVER THE COMPONENTS OF THE TARGET SO WE REALLY THIS LANGUAGE WAS ALL CRAFTED ON THE RESPONSE TO OUR OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS. WE THINK WE'VE DEVELOPED AN INDIVIDUAL UP APPROACH THAT ALLOWS FOR INDIVIDUALIZED DETERMINATIONS- TO BE USED AS NEEDED. THE HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS ALSO OR JUST THROW STAKEHOLDER. TO SET THE COST TARGETS AND WE VERY MUCH AGREE WITH THAT SO THE LANGUAGE REQUIRES PUBLIC BOARD MEETINGS THAT WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT VENUE FOR STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT. AND THE BOARD WOULD ACTUALLY BE REQUIRED TO HOLD A BOARD MEETING TO DISCUSS TARGETS- PUBLIC COMMENT WOULD OF COURSE BE HEARD AND THEN- THE TARGETS COULDN'T. COULDN'T BE SAID AT THAT MEETING BUT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE A SUBSEQUENT MEETING SO WE FELT THEN THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ROBUST STAKEHOLDER. ENGAGEMENT THE HOSPITALS HAVE ALSO RAISED A CONCERN ABOUT LOWER RATES PAID BY MEDICAID AND MEDICARE AND THAT THAT REQUIRES- OF THE HIGHER COMMERCIAL RATES. AND SO AGAIN WE'RE STARTING FROM- IF THAT'S BUILT INTO THE SYSTEM NOW- THEN THAT IS AN INPUT. AND DATA FROM PUBLIC PAYERS WILL BE INCLUDED IN TESTIMONY ON THIS POINT WILL BE CONSIDERED. MOVING ON TO ACCESS AND QUALITY THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATIONS URGED THE COST MARKETS NOT BE BASED ON A PER CAPITA BASIS AND ADDRESS ONLY THE RATE OF GROWTH NOT- CUT EXISTING HEALTHCARE SPENDING LEVELS AND AGAIN- WE DID MODIFY THE DEFINITION OF HEALTHCARE COSTS FOR. IN RESPONSE TO THIS CONCERT LAST YEAR. THE HOSPITALS OF ALL OBJECT DEFECTOR PARKING AND ARE THE- DIFFERENT TARGETS AMONG. CAN RESULT IN HIGH RISK PATIENTS GETTING SHUFFLED TO PROVIDERS SEEKING TO AVOID. TRIPPING THE COST GROWTH MARKETS AS PREVIOUSLY IT'S CRITICAL TO START WITH AN ALL IN APPROACH AND THEN WE DO ALLOW SOME INDIVIDUALIZED ANALYSIS IS NEEDED IF A PARTICULAR SECTOR OR ENTITY- THEY GO OVER THE COST TARGET. GIVEN SOME SECTORS MAY PLAY AN OUTSIZE ROLE IN CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASING COST OF CARE WE BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE BOARD TO BE ABLE TO SET SECTOR MARKETS. WE HAVE PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE SETTING OF SECTOR TARGETS BE DONE IN A MANNER THAT MINIMIZES FRAGMENTATION AND POTENTIAL OPTION THING. AND THE COURAGE'S CAUGHT COOPERATION AMONG THE ENTITIES. THE NEXT WE ARE ASKED TO ADDRESS- IS ABOUT THE SPORTSMAN'S- SO HEALTH URGE THAT THAT THE DEPARTMENT PROCESS BE ALLOWED AND FOR THAT- AND THAT THE OFF SHOULDN'T CELEBRATE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS BUT BUT SHOULD ALLOW A LOT OF. COLLABORATION AND WE THINK THIS IS EXACTLY THE ENFORCEMENT APPROACH IN OUR LANGUAGE. THE OFFICE WILL ENFORCE THE COST TARGETS AND COLLABORATIVE AND PRODUCTIVE WAIT- WE START WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR HEALTHCARE ACTIVITIES- WE WANT IF WE NEEDED TO PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PLANS BASED ON THEIR DATA- THAT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE ESTABLISHED THAT'S ESTABLISH DEADLINES- FOR UP. DATES TO MAKE SURE THERE COULD. AND ALL OF THAT WERE HAPPEN- IS AS PUBLIC MEETINGS BEFORE ANY OF. PENALTY ARE. SO WE DO A PROGRAM. I'M IN FOR- MODEL. IN IN. AND FONG. WITH ENTITIES. DAVID THE HOUSE- URGED THE DISEASE BEING BY AND NOT PREACH REQUIRED THAT POSE EVERY GEOGRAPHIC BASED HARD- THE DISTRICT ARE PARTICULARLY. WITH THE OF COSTS AND GROWTH RESTRICTIONS ABOUT AT DATA BUT THIS IS REALLY JUST FOUNDER TO THE OFFICE WE START VERY WITH THE DATA. EIGHT HI FORMER OFF THAT HAS LONG OF COLLECTING DATA IN DISSEMINATING INFORMATION ABOUT MANY COMPONENTS OF HEALTH OF CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. TO THE OFFICE'S DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS OF COST RENDON DRIVERS OF SPENDING THE BOARD WILL DEVELOP DATA INFORMED ENGAGE AND METHODOLOGIES. TO SET HEALTHCARE COSTS. THE OFFICE WILL TAKE A COMPLIMENT APPROACH TO DATA COLLECTION AND- FOR MAKES DATA SOURCE. I WELL AS DEVELOPING A IN ADDITIONAL- ALL BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE. EMERGING HEALTH CARE PAIN STATUS- AND AS WELL AS DATA SHARING AGREEMENTS THE H. YES IT MIGHT- AND CALIFORNIA. OKAY I'M VERY IMPORTANT WE'VE ASKED TO IT- HOW WILL BE SURE THAT THE- COSTS DON'T NEGATIVELY IMPACT. ACCESS TO OUR QUALITY OF CARE. THIS IS AGAIN JUST CRITICAL TO THE OFFICE SO BOTH THE OFFICE AND THE HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY BOARD WILL UTILIZE COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY FOR HEALTH CARE COST CONTAINMENT TO SET TARGETS FOR AFFORDABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY WELL ALL THESE MAINTAINING THE FUNDAMENTAL PRIORITIES OF HEALTH ACCESS QUALITY. WOULD BE. ARE OFFICE AND THE BOARD WILL UTILIZE THE MECHANISMS PROVIDED IN THAT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AT ALL THESE THE THROUGH A FEW. FIRST IS TO SET HEALTHCARE COSTS PARKING THERE IS A LIMIT ON INCREASES IN HEALTHCARE SPENDING NOT A REQUIREMENT TO REDUCE- HEALTHCARE SPENDING SO WE TALKED ABOUT THAT. WE WILL ALSO SET COST TARGETS INFORMED BY DATA COLLECTION AND- USING A METHODOLOGY THAT IS EVIDENCE BASED AND THAT ACCOUNT FOR THE REALITIES OF HEALTHCARE SPENDING FEEL BY THE DATA. THE PUBLISHING REPORT. REPORTS INCLUDING OVER- WHICH WILL RESULT IN GREATER OF POSITIVE EFFECT ON ACCESS. EQUITY YEAH REPORTS WERE INCLUDE HEALTHCARE SPENDING TRENDS- I'M FLYING FACTORS AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS AND WE'LL ALL ALL THE WHILE- MEASURING QUALITY AND EQUITY TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. THE OFFICE WILL ALSO PROMOTE THE SHIP FROM PAYMENTS ARE BASED ON FEE FOR SERVICE TO THOSE THAT RECORD HIGH QUALITY- AND COST EFFICIENT CARE AND SOAK AND I'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT. WILL ALSO BE MONITORING AND ASSISTING IN THE EFFORTS OF HEALTHCARE ENTITIES TO MEET THE COST TARGET SO THE INTENT IS NOT TO TAKE A PUNITIVE APPROACH. TO ONE FOURTH THE COST TARGETS WHICH COULD HAVE POTENTIALLY HARMFUL UNINTENDED IMPACTS BUT EVEN IS TO ENCOURAGE AND ASSIST HEALTHCARE ENTITIES. TO ADOPT AN OVERALL COST CONTAINMENT STRATEGIES TO BE RETIRED. OUR SO IF I HELP ENTITY WERE TO THE TARGET. THE OFFICE WILL FOR OF OUT TO THE ENTITY PROVIDE TECHNICAL REVIEW DATED- TO WE DIDN'T MAKE IT ERROR AND THREE TECHNICAL THIS IS AND FOR- IMPROVEMENT PLANS AS NEEDED- YOU KNOW WE WILL WORK TOGETHER IN A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH. I ALSO JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT HEALTHCARE COSTS. IN AND OF THEMSELVES A SIGNIFICANT DRIVER OF INEQUITABLE LOWER QUALITY CARE SO WHILE IT'S AND IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE CRAP IN OFFICE AND APPROACH IT DOESN'T NEGATIVELY IMPACT QUALITY AND CARE QUALITY QUALITY AND EQUITY ARE ARE ARE BEING NEGATIVELY IMPACTED TODAY BECAUSE COST. OF THAT C. H. YEP CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION SURVEY THAT I CITED TO EARLIER. HALF OF CALIFORNIANS. IF THEY'RE POSTPONED SOME TYPE OF HEALTH LAW TWELVE MONTHS. ALMOST HALF OF THOSE HAVE WORSE HEALTH CARE THERE THERE GOT WORSE OF. SO WHILE WE MUST GUARD AGAIN REYES THE BOTTOM WHERE THE COST CARE ACT AT THE EXPENSE OF CALL EQUITY. WELL IT'S THE TO IT. CALIFORNIANS STRUGGLING TO PAY FOR NEEDED CARE. BEFORE HELLO SO WERE ARE MY RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS I'M JOINED- BY THE COUNCIL BUCKLEY AND MICHELLE CONNIE FROM EVEN IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS- I WAS HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE TO STRUCTURE THANK YOU DIRECTOR NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM COREY HOW SHE DONE WITH THE L. L. THANK YOU DR ARAMBULA. HI COREY THIS DATA WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- REGARDING THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY YOU KNOW WE WOULD JUST FIRST FLAG THAT WE DO PLAN TO RELEASED AN ANALYSIS IN THE COMING WEEKS. FOCUSED ON VARIOUS PROPOSALS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THAT FOCUS ON ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY ISSUES- WHICH WOULD INCLUDE. AUTHOR ALICE IS CIRCUITS YEAR'S OFFICE OF HEALTH AFFORDABILITY PROPOSAL- WE'VE ALSO HAD A CHANCE TO INITIALLY REVIEW THE TRAILER BILL PROPOSAL THE ADMINISTRATION RELEASED LAST WEEK AND ARE AWARE OF THE CHANGES RELATIVE TO LAST YEAR'S PROPOSAL THAT. THE ADMINISTRATION JUST NOTED- JUST TO REITERATE HIS WOULD INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE. HIS BROKE INTO THE SCIENCE COMPOSITION AND SCOPE OF THE PROPOSED BOARD WITHIN THE OFFICE- SOME ADDITIONAL DETAIL ON THE SIZE OF PHYSICIAN GROUPS THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OF THE OFFICES REQUIREMENTS- AND DEFINITIONS OF HEALTHCARE TARGETS AND- ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS. UNDER WHICH HEALTH CARE COST TARGETS- COULD BE ADJUSTED. WHILE FURTHER COMMENTS ON THE RELATIVE MERITS OF THESE CHANGES MAY BE FORTHCOMING FROM US RIGHT NOW WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO CONSIDER- TO WHAT AGREED TO WHAT DEGREE- AGREES WITH THESE REVISIONS TO THE PROPOSAL RELATIVE TO LAST YEAR. AND TO WHAT DEGREE IT FIND FURTHER REFINEMENTS ON TO THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE AND WARRANTED. AT AN OVER ARCHING LEVEL WE GENERALLY FIND THE CONCEPT OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS OFFICE TO BE A REASONABLE STEP TOWARD ADDRESSING THE STATE'S AFFORDABILITY ISSUES- BUT WHICH IS NOW THAT CONTINUED MONITORING OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS OFFICE. I WILL BE CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT ITS ULTIMATELY SUCCESSFUL AT CONTROLLING HEALTH CARE COSTS- WE WILL ALSO JUST MENTION THAT THE RE APPROPRIATED FUNDS TO ESTABLISH THE OFFICE STARRED- INTENDED TO ONLY COVER THE FIRST COUPLE YEARS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF FURTHER FUNDING WOULD BE NEED TO BE PROVIDED. FOR MULTI YEAR IMPLEMENTATION INCLUDING FOR ONGOING STAFFING COSTS RELATED TO THE OFFICE OF THOSE ARE ALL OF AMEND THAT THE NAME YOU KNOW APPY TO PROVIDE BIRTH SYSTEMS. WORK DID. THANK YOU OUR NEXT IT WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DÍAS TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANYCOMMENTS OR- STATEMENTS WILL BEGIN WITH DOCTOR WHAT. FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU- TO THE ADMINISTRATION AND- FOR- FOR THE FOR THIS- THE NEW TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND- OBVIOUS I KNOW THIS I KNOW THIS ISSUE- PRETTY PRETTY WELL- THERE WERE A COUPLE OF CHANGES- IN THE TRAILER BILL. ONE OF WHICH IS THE- COMPOSITION OF THE COMMISSION- BOARD WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL IT AT THIS POINT- AND WE'RE WE'RE STILL WE'RE STILL CONSIDERING US CONSIDERING THAT- I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT- THAT ONE OF THE- KEY THINGS. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS THAT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY THIS IS NOT A NEW IDEA- HERE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS THE THIRD YEAR WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO PEOPLE ARE BECOMING FAMILIAR WITH IT. THIS REALLY THE MASSACHUSETTS MODEL HAS BEEN UP AND RUNNING FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW. THE KEY DIFFERENCE HERE IS THE PROOF THE POTENTIAL FOR- ENFORCEMENT- OF THE- OF PENALTIES POTENTIALLY- IF FOR NOT MEETING THE GOAL. AND I JUST WANT TO REITERATE- DIRECTOR LANCE BERRY'S COMMENTS. THAT THIS IS NOT MEANT TO BE PUNITIVE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS CHANGE BEHAVIOR. AND HOW PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THIS- AND HOW THE HOW THE- HOW HOW OF CONTROLLERS ARE SPENT. SO THAT WE CAN BENEFIT- THE MOST PEOPLE ON AND GET THE HIGHEST QUALITY CARE TO PEOPLE- IT IS IT IS PRETTY WELL DOCUMENTED THAT- THERE'S A IN IN HEALTH CARE- YOU KNOW IT IS MUCH AS THIRTY PLUS PERCENT. IS WASTE WASTED SPENDING. AND MY CONTENTION HAS BEEN FROM THE BEGINNING THAT IF YOU COULD FIGURE OUT A WAY TO- NOT WASTE SOME OF THE RESOURCES- ACHIEVING SOME OF THESE GOALS WOULD BE- WOULD BE- I'VE- THINK IT WOULD BE THAT DEBT. QUITE FRANKLY SOME OF THE DUPLICATION. SOME OF IT IS- IS- HI HI HI TREATMENT LOW OUT THE POSITIVE OUTCOME. THERE'S SO IT'SJUST GONNA TAKE SOME TIME. TO GET SORT THROUGH THIS AND I USE THIS EXAMPLE. OF A LOT BECAUSE IT STICKS IT STUCK WITH ME I CAN'T I CAN'T EXPLAIN WHY- WE KNOW THAT- FROM STUDIES I BELIEVE IT WAS THE CHC OF STUDY THAT BROUGHT THIS UP A FEW YEARS AGO. IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE- THE COST OF HEALTHCARE IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THANIT IS IN CHESTER COUNTY BY ABOUT 20% AND ARGUABLY- AND AS ACTUALLY ACTUALLY NOT ARGUABLY ITS IT'S- FACT FACT FACTUALLY- THE OUTCOMES AND THE QUALITY CARE IN SAN DIEGO TEND TO BE BETTER SO WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES SAN DIEGO AND SO CALIFORNIA ABLE TO PROVIDE HIGHER QUALITY CARE AT A LOWER COST IS IT THE RURAL NATURE OF SHASTA COUNTY IS IT IS IT- IS IT HE PER THE A LARGE NUMBER PROVIDERS POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY WE DON'T KNOW- IN THE I BELIEVE IN THE LONG RUN. THAT THAT AN OFFICE LIKE THIS WILL HAVE GIVE US OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THIS AND A MYRIAD OF OTHER ISSUES- THAT- THAT ACCOUNT FOR WHAT DRIVES THE COST OF COSTS OF HEALTH CARE- WHAT IS IT WASN'T SAID IS THAT THE- IN GENERAL IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS MY TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE THE COST OF HEALTH CARE HAS RISEN AT TWICE THE RATE OF INFLATION. AND THAT IS SIMPLY NOT SUSTAINABLE AND SO THE IDEA IS HOW DO WE GET THIS CLOSER TO INFLATION OR MAYBE EVEN A TOUCH BELOW INFLATION IF WE WERE TO BE REALLY OPTIMISTIC HERE BUT BUT I DID IT IS REALLY UNFATHOMABLE IT WE CANNOT GET CLOSER TO THAT THE RATE OF INFLATION- ME TO ROADS PEOPLE SALARIES ERODES PEOPLE'S COST OF LIVING- AND IN THE END- ARE WE PROVIDING THE SERVICES REALLY VALUABLE TO THEM- AS AS AS WE GO FORWARD SO. SO I WANT TO JUST HIT ONE ONE THING AND THEN WHEN TURNED BACK TO THE CHAIR- AND ONCE AGAIN JUST OF MY GRATITUDE TOWARDS TO THE ADMINISTRATION FOR CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US ON THIS- WE DO HAVE A BILL AB ELEVEN THIRTY- SINCE SENATE HEALTH- THE LANGUAGE WILL BE. IDENTICAL AT SOME POINT- TO WHAT'S GOING ON HERE- AND WE'RE HOPING THAT THE SENATE- ACTUALLY WERE EXPECTING THE SENATE- TO BE ABLE TO- HERE THIS EARLY- AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD- THROUGH THE PROCESS BUT ON THE QUESTION OF ENFORCEMENT I JUST WANT TO SAY YOU KNOW THIS IS THIS IS A THIS IS THE ONE PIECE THAT I THINK IN GENERAL HAS RAISED A LOT OF CONCERN. AMONG PEOPLE AND IT ISN'T MEANT TO BE UNITIVE- THERE'S GONNA BE PLENTY OF A- FOR. ACTIONS IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY REVIEW. IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE IF YOU'VE GONE OVER YOUR TARGET YOU'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING- BECAUSE OF CERTAIN KINDS OF INVESTMENTS THAT'S THAT'S A GOOD THING- IF YOU'VE GONE OVER YOUR TARGET BECAUSE YOUR- YOU HAVE FOR OTHER REASONS. WE WANT TO GIVE YOU TH OPPORTUNITY FOR CORRECTION ACTION CORRECTIVE ACTION. AND THERE WILL BE IT THAT THE FINE IS POTENTIALLY BUT THE LAST THING ON THE LIST SO. SO MY HOPE IS THAT PEOPLE WOULD JUST BEGIN TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR. THINK ABOUT HOW THEIR HOW THEIR PROCESS HOW THE PROCESSING CARE OR PROCESSING FEES AND THINGS FOR CARE- AND RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE REAL PEOPLE ON THE OTHER END OF THIS THAT ARE. HAVING TO PAY- PAY THESE BILLS AND- THEY'RE ANGRY THEY'RE FRUSTRATED AND THEY'RE SCARED BY THE RISING COST OF HEALTHCARE. AS IS EVIDENCED BY THE BY THE DIRECTOR LANSFORD SPOKE ABOUT. THE NEED TO THE EIGHTY THREE OR EIGHTY SIX PERCENT. OF CALIFORNIANS CONSIDER TO HEALTH CARE COSTS TO BE- EXTREMELY OR VERY IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW. THAT'S A STAGGERING NUMBER AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO THAT SO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU TO THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THEIR EFFORTS. LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD- I WILL TAKE A MOMENT AND- REALLY DO WANNA. SPEND A LITTLE TIME LOOKING AT SOME OF THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. I'M I'M GONNA FOCUS ON ARTICLE FOUR WHICH IS THE QUALITY AND EQUITY PERFORMANCE WHICH- I WOULD JUST. POINT OUT IS ONE PAGE OUT OF FORTY. AND REALLY DO WANTS TO ENGAGE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON GOING AND HOW WE ENSURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING A QUALITY PRODUCT AS WE ARE. LOOKING TO SET COST TARGETS. AND SO WHAT I'D REALLY LIKE. TO DIG INTO IS THE TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS THE- TIME AND DISTANCE STANDARDS WHICH ARE PART OF THE KNOX KEEN. REQUIREMENTS AND I UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE RECENTLY- PUT INTO STATUTE OF REQUIREMENTS TO HAVE SEVENTY. PERCENT PERFORMANCE ON THOSE TIME. LEE ACCESS STANDARDS. THAT I'M HOPEFUL AS WERE FOLLOWING THIS THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO TRACK AND TREND AN INSURER THAT. HAS WERE PROVIDING UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO CARE THAT. THOSE OF US WHO COME FROM COMMUNITIES THAT STRUGGLE TO HAVE THE SAME NUMBER OF PROVIDERS. ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THE SERVICES THE QUALITY HEALTHCARE. THAT WE SO DESIRE. AND SO WOULD WANT TO SIMPLY. MAKE SURE AS WE ARE. GOING FORWARD AND DEFINING WITHIN THE TRAILER BILL HOW WE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT THESE QUALITY METRICS. THAT YOU INVOLVE THE LEGISLATURE IN THAT PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- CAN PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN. ENSURING THAT THE PRODUCT AT THE END OF IT IS SOMETHING THAT'S WORTHWHILE. FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AS WELL. NOW I WILL AGREE WITH THE L. A. L. AS I BELIEVE. THAT THIS IS A REASONABLE STEP FOR US TO BE TAKEN. THERE'S A REASON WHY WE PRIORITIZE THAT AND PUT IT. IN OUR FIRST HEARING WITHIN SUB ONE HAS IT IS AN AREA FOR US TO FOCUS ON. AS AN INSTITUTION AND TO MAKE LIVES BETTER FOR CALIFORNIANS. AND I'D LIKE TO RECTOR LANDSBERG IF WE COULD TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS SIMPLY AN INTERNAL PROCESS BETWEEN OUR BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. AS I BELIEVE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE TO GET THIS DONE RIGHT. I WILL APPRECIATE MANY OF THE CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED BETWEEN THIS VERSION AND PREVIOUS VERSION SAYS I BELIEVE THIS IS A BETTER PRODUCT THAT WE ARE. LOOKING AT AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT THE CONVERSATIONS THIS YEAR WILL BE MUCH MORE PRODUCTIVE. AND ULTIMATELY FRUITFUL BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. WITH THAT I WILL- ASKED TO FOLLOW UP WITH H. CHI FOLLOWING THIS HEARING BUT- WE'LL MOVE ON FROM THIS ISSUE AND THANK THIS PANEL VERY MUCH. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO PANEL THREE WHICH IS ON THE P. C. P.

THANK YOU DR ARAMBULA AND DOCTOR WORK SO I THINK- IT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION AND ONE WE WOULD WE WOULD WELCOME SOME GUIDANCE ON WE SIMPLY NEED TO. REPRESENT THAT THE REALITY WHICH IS THAT WE HAVE STATUS STOPPING TO COLLECT THE DATA AND TO BOTH THE DATA AND MAKE IT AVAILABLE IT WOULD JUST TAKE AN ADDITIONAL LEVEL OF STAFFING IF THE STATE DECIDES IT WANTS TO DIG IN AND DO ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS.

BUT WITH THAT I WILL THANK VERY MUCH PANEL FIVE WE WILL MOVE ON THE PANEL SIX ON THE AFFORDABILITY OPTIONS REPORT PRESENTERS FIRST WE HAVE K&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt; REVELL DIRECTOR OF POLICY ELIGIBILITY AND RESEARCH DIVISION WITH COVERED CALIFORNIA. AND LUKE COACH MARROW SENIOR FISCAL AND POLICY ANALYST WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE PLEASE BEGIN DIRECTOR RAVEL. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR STATE CHERYL NUMBERS. I DO HAVE A FEW FIGHTS FOR THE PRESENTATION TODAY METROPOLIS IN JUST A MOMENT AND THAT AS WE GET GOING ON IT WOULD BE- LONG. LIVE IT WOULD BE TO START WITH HE SAID. FROM ABOUT COVERAGE. THE AFFORDABLE ACT. A REFORM THE BILL HEALTH INSURANCE MARKET. I'M IN SOUTHWEST ARE HEALTHCARE EXCHANGE WHERE CONSUMERS CAN BUY A PRINCIPAL FUNDS WITH FINANCIAL HELP I TO BASED ON INCOME TO SUPPORT THEIR PREMIUMS AND OUT OF POCKET COSTS AND THIS COVERAGE IS AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE EMPLOYER SPONSORED COVERAGE MEDIC CAL FOR MEDICARE OCTOBER CALIFORNIA IT CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETPLACE. ARE WE CONTRACT WITH TWELVE HEALTH INSURANCE CARRIERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OFFER COVERAGE. WHICH IS THE PACKAGES AND- THE- BENEFITS BETTER DEFINED A HIGHLY. IN THE FOR CARE ACT FOR THEIR STUFF IN THE STATE. OUR MEMBERS TO FROM SO COVER OFF. THAT VERY IN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY PAY. THE MONTHLY THROUGH PREEMIE FOR THREE OUT OF FIVE COSTS WILL BIG TO THAT MORE. AS OPPOSED THIS FIVE. OF WE WILL TRY INTO TWELVE TO AMPLE. A NEED LEADING CAL. TO ADD A FEDERAL TO ADD STEEP SUBSIDIES ON TOP OF THE FEDERAL SUBSIDIES. AND WE'RE THE FIRST STATE IN THE NATION TO DO THAT WOULD PROVIDE A PREMIUM SUPPORT TO MIDDLE INCOME CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL FINANCIAL HELP. AND THEN LAST YEAR. ON THE CALL THE NINETEEN. AND THEN MAKING. RECESSION THE AMERICAN RESCUE FROM SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED FEDERAL PREMIUM SUBSIDIES. IN CALIFORNIA'S MODEL TO MIDDLE INCOME CONSUMERS PREVIOUSLY WEREN'T ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL SUPPORT. AND IT'S SIGNIFICANTLY. REDUCED PREMIUM CONTRIBUTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS UNDER 4100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL HIGHER CUT OFF FOR FEDERAL SUPPORT. OF THE SUBSIDIES ARE IN EFFECT THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AT THIS YEAR- IN RESPONSE TO THIS ACT SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN AFFORDABILITY ON THE PREMIUM SIDE COVER CALIFORNIA HAS JUST REPORTED RECORD HARLEM THAT FOR US A ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION SIGN UPS. ARE THAT WAS THE LEAD INTO THE FINAL WEEK OF OPEN ENROLLMENT WHICH THAT CLOSE FOR US LAST YEAR- WHICH IS HAVE ONE MORE AFFORDABILITY METRIC HERE ON THE SLIDE WHICH IS NOW. A TWO THIRDS OF OUR MEMBERS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR COVERAGE THAT COST LESS THAN TEN DOLLARS PER MONTH. SO THAT'S THE NEWS ON THE PREMIUM SIDE FOR US. SEVEN ON THE TO THE NEXT. IN THE FEDERAL SAID. I THAT WE SAW IN THEIR REST PLAN WERE LIMITED TO PRE SO I QUESTIONING SUPPORT STILL LIVE UNDER THE AFFORD CARE. BLOODEDLY ON THIS CHART WOULD I WOULD JUST OUT ITS ASSURING SUPPORT IT'S OUR LOWEST IN IN THE INDIVIDUAL UNDER 2100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL AND LIKE MENTIONED IT DOES ALLOW US TO REDUCE THEIR DEDUCTIBLES AND MAXIMUM OUT OF POCKET EXPOSURE THE HEARING THERE COPAYS AND COINSURANCE FOR- FOR CERTAIN SERVICES. SO YOU CAN SEE ON THE SLIDE AS INCOME RISES SO DO THOSE DEDUCTIBLES FROM ON A SORT OF A MODEST AMOUNT IN SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL ALTHOUGH WITH THE ABSENCE OF DOLLARS- AND COPAYS RISE AS WELL. SO THAT- WE SEE THAT IN A MOMENT AND IMPACTING THE CHOICES THAT PEOPLE MAKE IN THEIR PLANS APRENDIZ. FIVE WE HAVE FIGHT IN BEGINS CHIU SO. OUR CONSUMER AT LOW IN WHO ARE L. FOR. A SICK PREMIUM ASSISTANCE AND QUESTIONS PLANS THAT OFFER THEM THE BEST FOR IT SO THOSE BARS THAT ARE STILL PER THAT ARE SILVER LEVEL OF COVERAGE WE OFFER A CAR SHARING SUPPORT. AND THAT'S WHAT THE MAJORITY OF THE- LOCAL CONSUMERS CHOOSE. THOSE TO MAKE THE CHOICE TO ADAM TO BUY MORE GENEROUS COVERAGE FOR TO BUY LESS GENEROUS COVERAGE WHICH HAS A LOWER PREMIUM AND THAT'S BOTTOM BAR THERE YOU SEE THAT FOR BRONZE PLAN. WAS PREMIUMS BUT ALSO THE HIGHEST OUT OF POCKET COSTS FOR CONSUMERS AND AS THEIR INCOME RISES YOU CAN SEE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CONSUMERS BUYING THAT BRONZE PLAN. OPTED THAT LOWER MONTHLY PREMIUM AND MORE OUT OF POCKET IF THE CHIEFS CARE. AND THEN WE HEARD DIRECTOR LANDSBERG TALK ABOUT STATE NUMBERS BUT WE JUST PUT. SOME OF OUR SURVEY DATA ON HERE WHICH IS OUR ENROLLEES IN BRONZE REPORT DELAYING CARE. AND DUE TO COME GENERATED THREE TOP HOMES ADAMS ARE IN ROLES WITHIN OUR SILVER NINETY FOUR PLAN. THAT FAR. NOT MORE BRANDED NAME OUR SHARING AND TRY LOW INCOME INVOLVED THAT COVERS MOST OF THEIR- IN THE- OUR ARMS WE DO SEE THAT. OUT PLANS. AND I THINK THIS THE BACK. ALL ON WHICH THE STATEMENTS AND US LAST YEAR THE BUDGET. THAT ARE FOR. LOWER INCOME ARE OF POCKET COSTS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE THAT OUR REPORT OKAY THAT'S CARE WITH THE REACH. AND WHICH IS. ALSO WITH THE IS BRIEF ATTEMPT DOG. ON THAT WAS FOR BY OUR ACTUAL IT MAY. AMP WITH OF THE THAT ARE TOXIC ARE ALL THE OPTIONS THAT ARE IN OUR- IN- WITHIN DIFFERENCE IN HERE THAT ALLOW- IT'S SORT OF PLAY WITH EVEN AN OPTION THAT DIDN'T. MARC A SIGNIFICANT OTHER OPTIONS ARE AT AT AS I TURNED TO THE I WILL THINK- HOURS. MUCH STAFF REPORT IN OUR PER. AND IN THE REPORT. PREMIUM SUBSIDIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE UNDER THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN- WHILE WE WERE IN THE COURSE OF OUR WORK FOR THE HOUSE ASK. THAT THEIR ACT. THAT QUESTION OF THE POLICY. AND WHAT EXTENDED MEREKA PASTI PLAN PREMIUM SUBSIDIES THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SALUTE THOSE RICH INDIAN SUBSIDIES IN PLACE FOR SEVERAL MORE YEARS. I'M ALSO GONNA STAB ESTABLISH AFFORDABILITY FUNDS THAT WOULD PROVIDE TEN BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. BETWEEN TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE FOR MARKETPLACES LIKE COVERED CALIFORNIA DID WITH THE STATE LEGISLATURE ENVISIONED LAST YEAR WHICH IS TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. THE LOGIN ROWLEY'S COSTS INCLUDING THOSE COPAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES. AND SO THIS WAS OUR NEW NEWS FOR I THINK HE DID INFORM THAT PHOTO TOOK IN THE FOR OF STILL ON. I'M GLAD OUT- OPTION THAT ARE IN FOR. THAT ARE REALLY A LOT ST POLICY SCENARIOS IN ALL WALKS THROUGH. HERE SO IN THE FIRST. I SIX ACTUALLY THE SCENARIO WHERE WE LOSE THAT ENHANCE FEDERAL. AND IN AMERICA SB CLAM PREMIUM SUBSIDY. ARE INTENDED TO BILL FACT THAT ARE WORTH- THAT HOLLIS THE STATE WOULD THEN FACE TRAITOR- OF USE MONEY FOR CAR SHARING. FOR USING FOR STATE PREEMIE OF SO WE ARE PROVIDE SOME AND NUMBER. TO AND FROM THAT. AND POLICY CHOICE BE. AT THAT MOST OF EUROPE FOCUSES COST SHARING. UNDER THAT FIRST QUESTIONS. WE WOULD HAVE BETTER FUNDING WE HAVE A VARIETY% OPTIONS THAT MIGHT BE- MORE APPROPRIATE FOR OUR FEDERAL FUNDING. AND THEN THE THIRD SCENARIO IS. THE ONE THAT THE ANTICIPATED WHEN WE START ON OUR WAY LAST FALL WHICH THAT FEDERAL PREMIUM'S. TO CONTINUE AT THE STATE FARM PROVIDES FUNDING AND TECHNICAL THAT REDUCE YEAR. COSTS WE DID MANAGE HERE AT THE STATE OF. AND THAT WHICH IS IN BUDGET LAST YEAR. OKAY LET'S LOOK A LITTLE ARE. SYNEREO AMERICAN WAS PLAN SUBSIDIES ARE EXTENDED M. WE DO HAVE SOME NATURAL HERE IF THAT TO HAPPEN COVER CAL ENROLLEES WOULD LOSE ON. ABOUT ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND MISTER PER HOUSEHOLD PER MONTH. WOULD BE LOSS TO THIS OF THE ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN IN PREMIUMS UP. SO THAT'S AVAILABLE IN EUROPE OR MORE GRAND DETAIL USE IN THIS- THAT WE WOULD OFFER EXTRA ASSISTANCE IT NEEDED- SHOULD THE LARGEST TO THINK ABOUT RICH THAT FORM FASHION. THOSE DETAILS ARE IN THE- AND I'LL TURN NOW TO SCENARIO TWO IS- WHICH IS FOR SHARE OF THE KEY AND A VERY CHIU THAT'S TRACKED EXHIBIT IN THE- CERTAINLY WANNA HAVE WHAT YOURSELF BY. BUT I WOULD USED. ILLUSTRATES OF THE TRADE OFFS WE LOOK AT AND- SOME OF THE WORK THAT DID HE WILL NOT ROAD WHERE YOU SEE. THE LEVELS OF THIS OPTION USES. UP AT 6100% OF FPL AT THE STATE NEEDS FOR ESTABLISH A PREMIUMS. PROGRAM UP WITH MAKES. INVESTMENTS REDUCE POSH HEARING PEOPLE WHO ELIGIBLE TODAY OF THE FEDERAL. AND WE WILL SIX. ELIGIBILITY PEOPLE WHO AREN'T ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL AND CITY STAFF ON. WHERE YOU HAVE THE NUMBERS INCREASE NINETY FIVE EIGHT NINETY. DOES YOUR. OUR BUT OF COVERAGE THAT MEANS THE WHOLE FLAT ON A WOULD BE ABOUT 90% OF THE COST. IN THE THAT'S WE'RE ABLE TO OFFER PLAN THAT HAVE. THREE DOLLARS G. KNOW DRUGS BY THE PRIMARY CARE VISITS. AND ON THE TOP AND CRITICAL THE OF THAT OF THE STAFF. WE WILL DEDUCT UP IN PLAN THAT OFFER BECAUSE DURING ITS- WE CAN GAUGE LOT WITH STICKER AND DEDUCTIBLES. AND THE WE SET UP TO DATE- THEY DON'T APPLY. IN THE FILM. UP TO YOUR MOST THE ONLY A IN PATIENT THAT THAT WE TO THE IMPACT THOSE TO. FOR MOST YOU GET K. FIRST DOLLAR WHEN YOU **** AT THE TOP AND IT JUST HOPE. AND THAT IS WE ENGAGE A STATE THERE WERE A LOT OF. ABOUT CONSUMERS NOT UNDER. THAT NEW OF OUR THE AND COVER ALL OF. AND PICKED NOT SIGNING UP THROUGH A CONSTRUCTIVE HAVING PRODUCTIVE. OR SOMETHING UP BEING AT THE TO YOU THEIR- FOR PRIMARY CARE. IT'S BECAUSE THEY ASSUME THAT THAT IS A OF. FIVE SEVEN. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT BENEFITS DISCUSSION THAT WE ARE THE OPTIONS WITH MY HERE- WHERE THE STATEMENT WILL PROVIDE ENHANCED PRESSURE AVERAGE BE AT LEAST AT THE LEVEL OF COVERAGE WITH PLAN ABOUT EIGHTY PER OF X. COST. AND I'LL JUST STAY A LITTLE THAT DOLLAR THAT YOU SEE IT ON THAT THERE. THIS REACHES FOR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION YEAR UP SIX MILLION. A YEAR THE RANGE IS THERE HAVE TO DO WITH. AND ALRIGHT. AND THAT THEY WOULD MOVE FROM THE PLAN THERE INDICADO FROM- ALL AND FIVE PLAN PLANS TO THE EXTENT. THAT BE ABLE TAKE IT OF THE CLASH THAT FITS IN THE PRO COST UP. WE LOOKED AT A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT ENROLLMENTS AREAS THERE. AN ADVOCATE TO WORK WITH THE- IN THE LEAD. TO UP TO THESE NUMBERS OFFICE UP TO THE CAR. BASE ON THE ROLE WE HAVE FOR TWENTY TO BASED OUR- INVOLVEMENT CLOSING LAST. FOR NEXT WEEK OF OPTIONS OUR LAST WEEK OF OPTIONS ARE FOR STATE FUNDING. AND WE HAD THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE MILLION IN THE STATE AFFORDABILITY FUND IN MIND WHEN WE LOOKED AT THESE OPTIONS WOULD ALSO HAVE THE DIRECTION FROM THE STATUTE- PARTLY IN MIND. SO INTRODUCTION THE MORE SET UP THE TABLE WE PROVIDED OPTIONS WOULD. SIXTY INTELLIGENCE. FOR UP TO FOUR THE FIRST OF THE FEDERAL LEVEL- AND PRIORITIZE YOU OPTIONS THAT WOULD. PROVIDED POOL LEVEL OF COVERAGE THAT THOSE INDIVIDUAL. ON THE TOP WILL STEER MOST GENEROUS OPTION THAT OPTION- AGAIN WOULD EXPAND ELIGIBILITY GET NEARLY ELIGIBLE AT THE GOLD LEVEL COVERAGE BUT IT WOULD ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE CARD SUPPORT PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO DEMAND THAT HE FEDERAL PROGRAM MAKE THOSE- THOSE COMPANIES ARE MORE AFFORDABLE AND WOULD ELIMINATE DEDUCTIBLES. AND THEN JUST FINAL OUR BOTTOM. ROACHES BECAUSE OF THAT I THINK. REPORT THIS ON TO STATUTE ON TO THAT WITH I WHAT IT WOULD COST JUST TO THE- OUR- ALAMEDA DID THAT IN THE TEN OF MILLIONS REYES MOST OF THE OP SO THAT WE MODELED STATE. THAT SOME OF THE HIGH MILLION TO FOUR BILLION PER YEAR. SO I THANK COULD SPAWN WITH. WE ALSO- AT THE OF THIS LOOKS PRETTY OFFER ISSUES- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE DIRECTION WOULD BE. READ BY TWENTY TWENTY AT THE- LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION FIVE IMPLEMENTED PROGRAM SO DID QUITE A BIT OF DETAILED WORK THERE I THINK. WE ARE AT THE MOMENT RIGHT NOW EVEN THOUGH THERE'S UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE FEDERAL FUNDING- WE DO HAVE A CONTINGENCY PLANNING AND HUESO THAT WE CAN DO WHAT WE CAN ACHIEVE READY TO IMPLEMENT IF SOMETHING IF FUNDING IS AVAILABLE FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY THREE PLAN YOUR- I WOULD JUST CLOSE BY SAYING THAT WE WILL. CONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT DESIGN OF THE STATE ADMINISTRATOR PROGRAM IT'S CLEAR THE FEDERAL FUNDING. EMERGED THOSE ARE THE- AT THE END OF MY PREPARED. SEE IF I CAN TALK. TWENTY FIVE. THANK YOU DIRECTOR NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM THE L. A. L. GOOD AFTERNOON EVEN LUCAS MORROW WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. PUBLISH A MORE IN DEPTH ANALYSIS AND IN THE COMING WEEKS BUT ONE OF THE SHIP YOU ISSUES FOR LEGISLATORS CONSIDERATION.

TO THE TWENTY TWO THREE YOUR. THE PLAN ALL ALSO THANK UPGRADE PLANS OUT OF THE DEDUCTIBLES. WHICH STILL. PROVIDED ONE OF-OPTIONS IN THE RIVER- THIS OP WHAT SILVA CAN UPGRADES MORE GENEROUS THAT REDUCE THE COST INCLUDE WE CAN DEDUCTIBLE EVEN THOUGH THEY WOULD BE FORTY. THIS BE LESS OFTEN IMPLEMENT ALSO COULD BE IN THAT. AFTER HE GOT IT WOULDN'T ON THE BALLOT DESIGN COSTS AND SOME- JUGGLES WILL NOT BE AT. AN EDISON- DIRECTOR IT OF BACK UP ON THE DOCTOR.

LET ME TAKE THAT ONE WE AND WE ALWAYS START WITH- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THEY SORT OF PROVIDE A FLOOR FOR US TO CREATE OUR BENEFIT DESIGNS FOR THE SUBSEQUENT YEAR. WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF CREATING THOSE BENEFIT DESIGNS FOR TO PLAN YOUR TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND A DEBT GENERALLY AGAIN NOW THAT THE GRANULAR LEVEL GENERALLY LIKE CONSUMER COST SHARING. A DEDUCTIBLES AND CO PAYS MAY HAVE TO RISE THIS YEAR. BASED ON THIS FEDERAL GRANDMOTHERS. AB RIGHT OKAY THANK YOU SO AND THEN JUST OF A FOR A KIND OF A QUSTION ANOTHER QUESTION SO WE'VE GOT NOW ELIGIBILITY FOR- PREMIUM SUBSIDIES FOR PEOPLE BETWEEN THE FOUR HUNDRED. 8100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL- AND I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW MUCH IS THAT TRANSLATED THAT THAT THAT SUBSIDY NOW TRANSLATING TO PEOPLE. ACTUALLY YOU KNOW INSTEAD OF BUYING THE BRONZE PLAN BUYING THE SILVER PLAN WHICH IS A MUCH BETTER PLAN. AND THAT'S A CUROUS IS WHAT YOU'RE SEEING THERE IN IN THIS IN THIS- ENROLLMENT PERIOD. AND THEN- AND THEN I MIGHT HAVE A FOLLOW UP DEPENDING WHAT YOUR ANSWER IS. AB WE ARE LOOKING AT OUR OPEN ENROLLMENT DATA TO SEE EXACTLY THAT ARE CONSUMERS. BUYING DIFFERENT- PLANS MAKING DIFFERENT CHOICES- THAN THEY WERE BEFORE THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN SUBSIDIES. WE DID SEE SOME THAT MAYBE MODERATE EVIDENCE WHEN WE STARTED WHEN WE IMPLEMENTED CAN RESCUE PLAN LAST SPRING AND THAT CONSUMERS. WERE CHOOSING- THE STOVER PLANTED A SLIGHTLY HIGHER RTE THAT WE DO WANNA. TAKE A FULL LOOK AT THE OPEN ENROLLMENT DATA AND THEN GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULDN'T- DIRECTOR OF L. I. ONE OF THE FIRST APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO. BE NATION LEADING AND HELPING TO PROVIDE PREMIUM SUPPORT FOR MIDDLE INCOME CALIFORNIANS AND I AM VERY APPRECIATIVE OF WHAT OCCURRED WITHIN THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN TO- BACK FILL MUCH OF THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE PUT WITHIN THOSE SUBSIDIES CREATING A- INCOME THRESHOLD OF EIGHT AND A HALF PERCENT WHICH WAS MUCH LOWER THAN WE WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE WITHIN. THE STATE BUT REALLY WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTOOD THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM WE'RE FACING IF THE BUILD BACK BETTER ACT IS NOT PASSED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AND CURRENTLY MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WERE LOOKING TO ESTABLISH THE HEALTHCARE AFFORDABILITY RESERVE FUND AT THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE POINT FOUR MILLION THAT'S APPROXIMATELY WHAT WE- COLLECTED LAST YEAR IN THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. BUT THE YEARLY ANNUAL PREMIUM ASSISTANCE WE'RE GETTING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW IS ONE POINT SIX BILLION. AND SO JUST TO PUT IT IN THE CONTEXT ABOUT THE WHOLE WE'RE GOING TO BE AND IF THE B. B. B. IS NOT. LAST AND WANTS TO MAKE SURE WE ARE DOING OUR DUE DILIGENCE IN EVALUATING ALL OF THE OPTIONS AND SO- I APPRECIATE THE- NATURE OF THIS CONVERSATION BUT I BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET THAT CLARITY ABOUT THE FEDERAL FUNDING. AS WE ARE GOING FORWARD THIS YEAR AND LOOK FORWARD TO THAT CONTINUED CONVERSATION. WITH THAT I WILL THANKS VERY MUCH PANEL SIX WILL MOVE ON TO THE PANEL SEVEN WHICH IS OUR FINAL PANEL FOR TODAY. WHICH IS ON CAL ARE EX AND MEDIC CAL R. X. WE WILL HAVE THREE PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL. FIRST VISHAL PARDON ME ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. MICHELLE BOSS THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. IN JC COOPER THE STATEWIDE MEDICAID DIRECTOR AND CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT THE HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. PLEASE BEGIN AGAIN ASSISTANT SECRETARY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE- HEY LOOK TODAY I'LL PROVIDE A STATUS UPDATE ON CALAR EKSEMPEL MAGICIAN. AS A RETAIL CAL OR X. INITIALLY BEGAN AS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL. OUR SYSTEM ALIGNMENT WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON ON THIS CONCEPT AND COUNTERACTS WITH LATER CODIFIED INTO LAW VIA SENATE BILL EIGHT FIVE ZERO AUTHORED BY SENATOR PAM. THE LEGISLATION REQUIRES TALENT HHS CENTER INTO PARTNERSHIPS TO PRODUCE OR DISTRIBUTE GENERIC PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. AND AT LEAST ONE FORMER DENZEL AND- BONTA NOTIFIABLE TOPPLING FOR MANUFACTURING I'M MORE AFFORDABLE INSULIN. EXPRESSED SURPRISE THAT RESULTS IN SAVINGS. SB FIVE TWO PARTNERSHIPS ARE BROADLY DEFINED AND INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO. AGREEMENTS FOR THE PROCUREMENT OF GENERIC PRESCRIPTION DRUGS BY WAY CONTRACTS OR PURCHASING BY A PAIR STATE AGENCY GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATION NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION OR OTHER ENTITY. SO FAR I. CHANCE OF THE PROTEST OUR NEXT WOMAN TENSION. AND YOUR POLICY DESIGN AND STRATEGY. AT THE FIRST STOP WE OBTAINED PROJECT PARTNERS AT JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY. THE UC CASING CENTER FOR INNOVATION. ALARIC'S DEVELOPED A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING. ONCE THE RELATIONSHIP AND ARRANGEMENTS FOR DATA SHARING RESEARCH AND CONSULTATION AND- WHEN THE PROJECT WORKERS. WE TEND SURVEYS STAKEHOLDERS STUDY THE BROADER LANDSCAPE OF GENERIC MANUFACTURING. IT CHECK H. CENTRAL PARTNERS TO ADVANCE THE STATE'S GOALS FOR A HEALTHY CALIFORNIA FOR ALL. WHERE ASCENTIAL MEDICINES ARE AFFORDABLE FOR ALL THOSE PROPERTIES THAT- SO I'M GETTING DESCRIBE THE PROCESS WE USED TO DEVELOP PRACTICAL- SURVEY AND SOME OF OUR FINDINGS. SO AND THE DETENTION OF THE SURVEY WAS TO DEVELOP A SELECTION FRAMEWORK FOR UP FOR TARGET DRUGS. FOR CHOLERA. SOMETHING CONSISTENT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF SB FIVE TO. CAL HHS. CONDUCTED A BROAD SURVEY OF RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS TO PRIORITIZE THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF. NOT CERTAIN CRITERIA- AND PUBLIC FOLDER AND ECONOMIC CRITERIA. THIS ALLOW INPUT FROM A BROAD ARRAY OF STAKEHOLDERS- HAS A POST CAL HHS- YOU KNOW OPENING OUR OWN- OPINIONS ON THE TABLE. COMES UP- DECIDING WHICH CRITERIA WORK WERE MOST IMPORTANT. SO WHAT WE DID IS ENGAGE A BROAD ARRAY OF STATE POLICY EXPERTS CONSUMER AND WEBER OUT GETS. OUR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PLANS AND PROVIDERS ARE CALIFORNIA BASED- APPROXIMATELY 20% OUT BASE OUTSIDE OF- OUTSIDE OF THAT CALIFORNIA. NO WE ARE SUPPORTERS STAKEHOLDERS BRING ORDER- DEVELOPING AREA THE MARKING CRITERIA ESSENTIALLY FOUNDED TWO BUCKETS- FIRST WITH ECONOMIC IMPACT FACTORS- JUST TO GIVE YOU A FLAVOR OF WHAT WHAT WHAT TYPES OF FACTORS WE ASKED- STAKEHOLDERS TO RECORDER. IS INCLUDED ACOSTA PAYER HI CONSUMER OUT OF POCKET SPENDING HIGH PRICE INCREASES- SOBRE KIND OF MORE ALONG THE LINES OF ECONOMIC IMPACTS. AND THE SECOND CATEGORY WE HAVE- ON TO THE BUCKET OF PUBLIC HELD DOCTORS- INCLUDED. I TRY THAT TARGETED A LARGE TARGETPOPULATION AND- A DRUG THAT TARGETED VULNERABLE POPULATIONS HAMANEH TRIBECA TREATS- HI MORBIDITY OR MORTALITY CONDITIONS. OPEN WE ARE STONE SURVEY RESPONDENTS TO ORDER ALL RANK- FROM FROM ONE TO ONE BEING THE HIGHEST RANKED RANK ELEVEN BIGELOW EST- THE RECORDER THAT THE ELEVEN- AREA. WE DID AFTER GETTING THE RESPONSES AND- WE USED AN ALGORITHM TO IDENTIFY- HOW MUCH WEIGHT SHOULD BE KEPT CHANGE PARTS PERHAPS- SO WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT- ESSENTIALLY- ALL THE- AMERICAN FEDERATION BECAUSE- THE SPREAD WAS FAIRLY NARROW. THE LOWEST. TARGET WEIGHT- WHAT SEVEN POINT 2% ON THE HIGHEST WAS TEN POINT 9% SO BECAUSE OF THAT NARAL SPREAD- WHAT THIS TOLD US IS THAT ARE ARE NONE OF OUR CRITERIA WERE OUT OF LEFT FIELD. WERE OFF THE MARK THEY'RE ALL ESSENTIALLY BAR AND IT'S JUST THAT SOME MIGHT BE A LOT MORE THAN OTHERS- OUR FINDINGS THE- THAT- CALAR ACTS SHOULD TARGET DRUGS THAT AFFECT A LARGE. POPULATION SESSION ONE TARGET AT THAT. A LARGE POPULATION- DRUGS THAT HAVE A LARGE ABSOLUTE TOTAL COSTS. SO THAT'S KIND OF A LIVING CREATURE AND MENTIONED THE THREE THAT ROSE TO THE TOP WORK- ONE LARGE TARGET POPULATION TO CARE COST THREE CONSUMER OUT OF POCKET COSTS. IF WE CAN PROVIDE YOU KNOW THE- THE RESULTS AND TOOK UP. TO TWO YEARS- THE BOTTOM FEAR ACTORS. WERE WERE MORE RELATIVE FACTORS. USE RELATIVE INCLUDE HIGH PRICE INCREASES- PATRICK SHORTAGE RESCUES EXTRATERRESTRIALS ARE KIND OF MORE YOU KNOW RELATIVE NON FACTOR WHEN COMPARED IT TO THE TOP THREE FACTORS I MENTIONED WHICH- HAD MORE TO DO WITH ABSOLUTE TOTAL IMPACTS. CONSTRUCTS A FROM THE SECRETARY WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY A LIST OF PRETTY WOMEN EVERY TARGET TRUCKS UTILIZATION DATA FOR MEDIC CAL COVER CALIFORNIA CALPERS. AND WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO AS OUR NEXT STEP IS. THAT'S WHAT WE CALL POLICY AND REGULATORY FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE DRUGS- THEY CAN SHOP ON OUR LIST BUT IT MAY NOT BE TECHNICALLY FEASIBLE- TO MAKE THEM BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS SO THERE MIGHT BE- AND ISSUES ARE REGULATORY FACTORS WE NEED TO TEST US COMMENTS IF THERE'S. A WORKAROUND OR SOLUTION. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW- INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS THAT IS A COMPLEX AREAS SO WE'RE GONNA BE RELYING ON SOME OF OUR PARTNERS- TRANSIENT TO HELP US- THERE ARE NOW ABOUT THAT TARGET REQUESTTO VIEW WHICH ONES ARE FEASIBLE TO MANUFACTURE. NOW I WANTED TO TURN TO THE HOW OF GETTING DRUGS TO CONSUMERS. THE BEST FANS- A FEW DIFFERENT BUCKETS- WHICH INCLUDE STRATEGIC OPERATIONAL MARKET ISSUES- HOW WALLER UNIVERSITY PARTNERS- THANK US FOR PROJECT IDENTIFYING TARGET DRUGS- WE ALSO NEED EXPERTISE- FOR HOW TO GET THE CARDS TO PATIENTS. SO INTERNALLY WE'VE LOOKED AT DISTRIBUTION MODELS SOME OF THESE. I'M NOT A- DOCTOR PARTNERS- DISTRIBUTION- IN THEIR STRATEGY WHILE OTHERS DO NOT- SO WHEN WE THINK OF DISTRIBUTION WE ALSO KEEP IN MIND EQUITY. GIVEN THAT- NOT ALL SIMMERS YOU PROTECT OUR DELIVERY MODELS- ESPECIALLY NEWER ONES LIKE MAIL ORDER PHARMACY- WE'RE ACTIVELY EXPLORING EXISTING CHANNELS WHICH INCLUDE HEALTH PLANS PBMS. WHOLESALERS AND PHARMACIES WHERE WHERE CONSUMERS ARE USED TO GOING TO GET THEIR DRUGS NUMBER ALSO LOOKING AT YOUR MODELS- WHICH ARE DIRECT TO CONSUMER. SO THIS TYPICALLY INVOLVES THIRD PARTY MAIL ORDER SERVICE- OFFERS OUR- CAPABILITIES TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER DRUGS TO PATIENTS- GIVEN THAT THIS IS THAT THIS IS A PARTICULARLY NUANCED AREA WE'RE GOING TO BE ENGAGING A CONSULTANT WITH INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE TO HELP WITH. THESE ISSUES I'M IN WITH TO GET THAT CONSULTANT IN PLACE BY EARLY SUMMER- SO NOW WILL DISCUSS PROGRESS AND NEXT STEPS WITH REGARD PARTNERSHIPS. ARE THE FIRST ONE AT THE PENTAGON MANY OF YOU THOUGHT THAT BUDGET EIGHT PAGES- HARPER. THE PROPOSAL THAT WILL BE COMING LATER IN THE SPRING- YEAH THE REDUCING THE COST OF INSULIN. SO CURRENTLY THE MAJORITY OF CALORIE AXES ATTENTION IS FOCUSED ON EXPLORING PARTNERSHIPS AROUND TO BRING AN INTERCHANGEABLE LOW CONFIDENCE ONE PRODUCTS TO MARKET. WITH THE OUR ACTS OF THE CALIFORNIA RECALL RELATED PLAY BALL- SO YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE EXPLORING AND MAKING PLANS IN THIS AREA AND WE HOPE TO SHARE MORE DETAILS IN THE SPRING. AS FAR AS FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES WHAT'S NEXT STEPS- WE- WE THINK YOU KNOW. OVER SIX PLUS WE HAVE A PARTNERSHIP ON INSTALL AND WILL REALLY LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR- DRUG THAT WE WANT TO TARGET THE FUTURE PENCIL IN AS A AS A BIOSIMILARS IS MORE COMPLICATED. COMPLEX WE THINK THIS BILL WILL MAKE IT EASIER. TO DO OTHER DRUGS SUCH A SMALL MOLECULE DRUGS EXCEPT HER PAIN POINT MEDICATIONS. ARE SO HARD. WHAT TARGET OTHER SMALL KILL DRUGS- BETTER ACTRESS FOR SHORTAGE OR THEIR HIGH PRICE OR SPECIAL. GENERICS ARE HIGH COST TO EXPLORE THE GENERIC MANUFACTURING SPACE BAR HOPPING INFORMATIONAL MEETINGS WITH. SMALL PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES ARE NONPROFIT AND THEN START UPS BETTER- ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF NEWER TECHNOLOGY TO REDUCE COSTS I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS DIRECTOR BOSS. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M I'M HERE TO SPEAK ABOUT THAT THE MEDICARE PROGRAM I JANUARY FOR THE CHARACTER LAUNCHED WE TRANSITIONED ALL MEDICAL PHARMACY SERVICES FOR MANAGED CARE TO KEEP OUR SERVICE. WITH MEDIC HELL OUR EXIT WE ARE STANDARDIZING THE MEDICAL PHARMACY BENEFITS UNDER ONE STATEWIDE DELIVERY SYSTEM THIS MEANS THAT NO MATTER WHAT COUNTY YOUR FIRST LEFT AND THAT THE SAME ACCESS TO THEIR PRESCRIPTIONS IF POSSIBLE. IMPROVING ACCESS TO PHARMACY SERVICES WITH THE PHARMACY NETWORK THAT INCLUDES THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE STATE'S PHARMACY TRANSACTION THE REIMBURSEMENTS ULTIMATELY LEADING TO GREATER EFFICIENCY FOR PHARMACIES PRESCRIBERS AND THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. AND STRENGTHENING CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE STATE SUPPLEMENTAL DRUG REBATES FROM PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS. IN ADDITION BETTER CHARACTERS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN ONGOING ANNUAL SAVINGS OF EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN MILLION TOTAL FUNDS APPLE IMPLEMENTATION THIS IS JUST LIKE THE REDUCTION IN OVERALL PHARMACY SPENDING IN ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND INCREASES IN OUR SUPPLEMENTAL AND OTHER REBATES. WHAT THE TRANSITION OF THE MEDICAL PHARMACY BENEFIT OF MORE THAN FOURTEEN MILLION MEDICAL MEMBERS TO A SINGLE DELIVERY SYSTEM WE ARE AWARE SOME ADDITIONAL SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES AND CONCERNS AND WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING TO ADDRESS INCLUDE EXCESSIVE CALL CENTER WAIT TIMES DELAYS AND PRIOR AUTHORIZATION PROCESSING AND SOME IMPROPER CLAIMS DENIALS. AND CHALLENGES WITH MAGELLAN'S DATA AND REPORTING. THE EX YES WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH MAGELLAN TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. OVER THE WEEKEND CHANGES WERE MADE THAT REDUCE THE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION BACKLOG BY ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT. AND ARE EXPECTED TO REDUCE THE INCOMING PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUESTS BY 80% WE WILL KNOW MORE IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS ON THE INCOMING PEACE. REDUCE THE POINT OF SALE CLAIM REJECT FROM ABOUT 20% LAST WEEK TO ABOUT 8% THIS MORNING. ADDITIONALLY WE EXPECT THESE CHANGES TO DECREASE CALL CENTER VOLUMES ABOUT 70% FOR CALL CENTER INCREASE ARE RELATED TO PRIOR AUTHORIZATION. TRANSFORMATIONAL POLICY AND IMPLEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BRING SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO RESULT IN SOME DISRUPTION. ART MEANT AND OUR CONTRACTOR MAGELLAN REMAIN COMMITTED TO SERVING OUR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES THAT THE UP MOST IMPORTANCE ALSO DEFECTIVE INEFFICIENT OPERATIONS INCLUDING ROBUST COMMUNICATION OUR PARTNERS AND BENEFICIARIES. I WILL NOW TURN IT OVER TO CASEY KUMAR STATE MEDICAID DIRECTOR TO OUTLINE IN MORE DETAIL SOME OF THE ACTIONS THE STATE TAKING AND TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES AND YOUR QUESTIONS IN THE AGENDA. GOOD AFTERNOON SO AS A DIRECTOR BOB OUTLINED IMPLEMENTATION THE MEDICAL OR ACT INCLUDES A NEW FORMULARY NEW UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS NEW REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGIES AND A NEW SYSTEM FOR FOURTEEN MILLION MEMBERS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PROVIDERS PHARMACISTS AND HOSPITALS STATE WIDE I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THIS ALONE IS A MASSIVE CHANGE HOWEVER DURING A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IT BRINGS TO BEAR EVEN LARGER IMPACT. AND WHILE WE'RE CONFIDENT MANY CALORIE ACTS WILL YIELD THE BENEFITS DISCUSSED BUT WE ARE AWARE OF THE MADWOMAN TEACHING CHALLENGES AND I WILL WALK THROUGH WHAT WE ARE DOING TO RESOLVE THOSE WALLS OF WHAT THOSE CHALLENGES ARE. HELLO OTHER. FOURTH MEDIC CALORIE HAS PAID OVER ELEVEN MILLION CLAIMS. TOTALING APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS THE FIRST CHECK RIGHT OF WAS INITIATED SUCCESS WE ARE WITH PAYMENTS GOING TO ALL PHARMACIES ON JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTH AS PLANS. YET AS WE SIT HERE ARE CLEARLY FIVE WEEKS INTO OPERATIONS MAGELLAN ARE MANY CALORIES BENDER I'M HAS REALLY STRUGGLED WITH THE OFFER SERVICE OPERATIONS. INCLUDING THE LONG HOLD WAIT TIMES. AND DELAYED PRIOR AUTHORIZATION TURNAROUND TIMES. THE DEPARTMENT HAD PUT IN PLACE DAILY MEETINGS TO DISCUSS ISSUE MANAGEMENT HIRING TRAINING- AS WELL AS THE OVERALL SYSTEM DESIGN EDITS NEEDED. TO MITIGATE THE CURRENT SITUATION THAT WE ARE AT. REGARDING LONG HOLD TIMES AT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER AS OF FEBRUARY FIRST MAGELLAN HAS ANSWERED OVER EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND CALLS. 60% OF THOSE CALLS ARE FOR BENEFICIARIES AND 40% OF OUR PROVIDERS. MAJORITY OF CALLERS ARE OPTING FOR A VIRTUAL HOLD CALL BACK. MAGELLAN FORECASTED- CALL CENTER VOLUMES TO BE AROUND FORTY THOUSAND CALLS THE WEEK OF WHICH EQUATED TO AROUND TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY F. T. JANUARY FIRST MAGELLAN HAD TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE F. T. E.'S AVAILABLE FOR CALLS. DURING WEEK ONE ACTUAL CALL VOLUMES CAME IN ONLY HOWEVER THE GERMANS FORECASTED AVERAGE HANDLING TIME WAS INACCURATE. WITH THE ACTUAL COMING IN OFF EIGHTY FIVE TWO HUNDRED AND 60% HIGHER. THAN PROJECTED UP WHICH HAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO HANDLE CALL VOLUMES WITH THE CURRENT STAFFING RESULTING IN AN AVERAGE 30% ABANDONMENT RATE. AND OFTEN THREE TO FIVE HOUR WAIT TIMES FOR THOSE CALLS. THIS WAS FURTHER EXACERBATED WITH ON A CONCERT RESULTING IN A VERY HIGH ABSENTEEISM WITHIN THEIR STAFF. ON ANY GIVEN DAY DURING THE FIRST TWO WEEKS OF JANUARY THE ACTUAL AVAILABLE STAFF TO ANSWER CALLS WAS AROUND A HUNDRED AND TWENTY F. T. E.'S. OF THE ORIGINAL TWO HUNDRED TWENTY HIRED ORDEAL ABILITY ON THE CALL CENTER. BY MAGELLAN ANTICIPATED LEARNING CURVE IN SUPPLEMENTAL TRAININGS IN THEIR FORECAST LARGE ABSENTEE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED THEIR OPERATIONS. TO RESOLVE THESE HOLD TIMES THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN AND COMMITMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE GEL AND- A DH CS IS ACTUALLY BROUGHT ONLINE IT'S MEDICAL CALL CENTER TO ASSIST WITH CALLS TO REDUCE THE WHOLE TIMES. MAGELLAN HAS COMMITTED TO ADDING A HUNDRED TWENTY F. EASE BY THE END OF FEBRUARY AN ADDITIONAL SEVENTY BY THE END OF MARCH- WE ARE AT A FOCUSING ON INCREASING TRAINING- AT MAGELLAN IS WORKING TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY. REALLY THE SPEED A FACT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU THE QUALITY OF CALLS ARE ANSWERED HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO BE PRETTY HIGH- BUT ADDITIONAL TRAINING REALLY NEEDS TO BE FOCUSED ON TO BRING THE RESOLUTION FASTER DECREASING THE OVERALL. YOU KNOW WAIT TIMES OF THOSE CALLS COMING IN ARE WE ALSO WORKING TO IMPLEMENT POLICIES THAT STREAMLINED THE EXPERIENCE FOR BENEFICIARIES AT THE PHARMACY. TO DECREASE THE CLAIM DENIALS IN THE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE IMPACT CALL VOLUMES. REGARDING THE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION TURNAROUND TIMES AS OF FEBRUARY FIRST MAGELLAN HAS RECEIVED OVER NINETY FIVE THOUSAND PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS. OF MAGELLAN FORECASTED AROUND SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PER DAY. AND YEAR ROUND A HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR AFTER BASED ON THEIR PROJECTIONS. HOWEVER I JANUARY FIRST MAGELLAN HAD OVER A HUNDRED SIXTY THREE YOU O JUST ONE SHORT OF THEIR PROJECTIONS- DURING THAT FIRST WEEK THE CALL AT THE PA BARGAINS RAFI SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN. FORECASTED COMING IN ON A RATHER. AVERAGE ABOUT THREE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED. I'M MOREOVER DO YOU CS THAT IMPLEMENTED A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAY GRANDFATHERED PRIOR AUTHORIZATION PROCESS FOR MEDICATIONS- WITH THE PRIOR APPROVAL- OR DISPENSING RECORD TO MITIGATE THE EXPECTED HIGH A PRIOR AUTHORIZATION VOLUME WITH THIS TYPE OF CHANGE. HOWEVER PRIOR AUTHORIZATION TURNAROUND TIME IS CURRENTLY GOING BEYOND THE REQUIRED TWENTY FOUR HOURS IT IS CURRENTLY TRENDING SEVENTY EIGHT. OF AGING ARE WE COLLEGE THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. TO INCREASE THAT TURN AROUND TIME WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN COMMITMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE US SINCE- JANUARY ELEVENTH VH THE AESTHETIC NEEDED I'M AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY ONE DH CS FTZS TO PROCESS PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS. OF MAGELLAN HAS COMMITTED TO ADDING SEVENTY TWO EAST BY THE END OF FEBRUARY FOR PRIOR OFF AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY FIVE BY THE END OF MARCH. ADDITIONALLY THERE WAS DEVELOPMENT OF A SHORT TERM PRIOR AUTHORIZATION MITIGATION STRATEGY I TO ADJUST VARIOUS EDITS- AND WAR. OF COURSE BUT THE PRIMARY FOCUS ON REDUCED MEMBER HARP AND SAFETY AS WELL THE BALANCE OF PROGRAM INTEGRITY. ARE THIS HAS RESULTED AS OUR DOCTOR BOSS MENTIONED- CORRECTOR. OF BOSS MENTIONED- LOOKING AT 80% REDUCTION OF INCOMING PRIOR AUTHORIZATION VOLUME IN A 50% REDUCTION OF THE BACKLOG AS OF THIS MORNING. I DA CS. AN EXPANSION OF THE CURRENT POLICY ON EMERGENCY FELL FROM FIFTY TWO HOURS THE FOURTEENTH DATE. ARMISTICE CAN EMERGENCY BILL ANY MEDICATIONS AFTER DISCRETION WITHOUT PRIOR AUTHORIZATION IT WITH THE GEAR THAT THE PHARMACIST WILL BE PAID THIS WILL ENSURE THE ACCESS TO CARE ISSUES ARE MITIGATED AND START TERM ALLOWING TIME FOR PRIOR AUTHORIZATION AND OR OTHER CREDIT ALL AGES ARE JUST MEANT TO BE NAY. WITH A BACKLOG OF MAGELLAN HAS BEEN FOCUSING ON THE FOCUS CASES THANK YOU FIRST AND HAD PARKED OUT CLINICAL STAFF TARGET REVIEW OF FIVE SENSITIVE DRUG CLASS. LASTLY DO YOU SEE S. THE NOGEN ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN ADDITIONAL PLANNING AND SUPPORT EFFORTS NEEDED FOR THE JULY FIRST AND DATE OF THE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAY TRANSITION POLICY. ULTIMATELY THE DEPARTMENT MAGELLAN HAVE BEEN WORKING TO RESOLVE REPORTED ISSUES. AND HAVE SEEN A REDUCTION IN THE POINT OF SALE CLAIM REJECTS FROM ACROSS THE MORNING. OTHER ITEMS ARE RESULTING IN HIGH CALL VOLUMES AND REPORTED IN FIRE EASE- INCLUDE THINGS LIKE A LACK OF HISTORICAL DATA FROM THE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PLANS AND THEIR SUB DELEGATED FIFTIES. NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAY TRANSITION POLICY. FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF OUR PLANS ESTIMATED THEY DID NOT PROVIDE THE H. THE S. THE TENSION THE MILLIONS OF CLAIMS PRIOR TO WORK GO LIVE. IN JANUARY ALONE MISSING DATA FROM THE PLANTS HAS IMPACTED ANYWHERE FROM FORTY TO FIFTY THOUSAND THAT A CALPERS WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING WITH OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS. TO COME TO A RESOLUTION AND GET THAT DATA INTO OUR SYSTEMS. CHIEF MOVING EFFECTUATE WHAT WE'RE HOPING WITH A FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT TRANSITION POLICY. ADDITIONALLY ARE COORDINATION OF BENEFITS BURKE WHAT OTHER HEALTH COVERAGE ARE YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN ENFORCING THAT- MEDICAID AS THE PAIR BLOCK RESORT WITHIN THE SYSTEM- AND SO THAT HAS. CREATED A NUMBER OF CALLS. A WE ALSO ARE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF. THERE WAS A CHANGE IN FORMULAR FOR SOME PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE A CHANGING COVERED OVER THE COUNTER MEDICATIONS AND PROVIDER DIFFERENT COMING FOR MIGLIOR WITH THE STATE'S CONTRACT DRUG WITH ITS RESULT IN A NUMBER OF CALLS IN ENQUIRING TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE THE STATE'S CONTRACT. WITH PROVIDERS THAT ARE NOT AS FAMILIAR ARE THERE WAS ALSO CHANGES IN REGARDS TO REIMBURSEMENTS FROM WHAT THEY'RE BEING PAID PREVIOUSLY UNDER THEIR MANAGED CARE PLAN CONTRACT TO THE FOR A FEE FOR SERVICE CLAIMS REIMBURSEMENT ON INCREASING CALLS ON THE PRIORIES IN REGARDS TO THE BOTTOM WELL. ADDITIONALLY THERE HAVE BEEN A NEW SYSTEM THAT WAS ROLLED OUT SO CLEARLY AS PROVIDERS OR PHARMACIES ARE GETTING OUR STANDARD WE GET CODES- OUR SYSTEM DOES REQUIRE CERTAIN THINGS TO BE TOUCHED BY A PHARMACIST- IS THAT THERE HAS BEEN SOME COMPLAINTS OF ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN AND WE ARE- QUICKLY LOOKING INTO HOW WE CAN MITIGATE- SOME OF THOSE OF THOSE PIECES THAT THE SYSTEM. R. AND LAST WEEK IN REGARDS TO YOU- VIRUS COMING IN OF ONE OF THE LARGEST PHARMACY CHAINS IN CALIFORNIA DISCONTINUED THEIR HOME DELIVERY SERVICE A JANUARY FIRST I WHICH HAS IMPACTED US SOME ACCESS TO MEDICATIONS FOR THOSE NEEDING HOME. DELIVERY IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE. WE ARE. WORK TO IN THAT ALL IMPLEMENT. ISSUES WITH MEDIC CAL OUR ACTS ARE DRESSED. A RESULT- REALLY GROUP BECAUSE IS BEING ESTABLISHED OF MAGELLAN A MUST BETTER- HAS PUT. A PLAN IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT SERVICE OPERATIONS ARE PERFORMING AT THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL. AND WE MONITOR THAT ON A DAILY BASIS. FURTHER WE HAVE REQUESTED MAGELLAN SIGNIFICANTLY STRENGTHEN OUR EDUCATION AND OUTREACH ACTIVITIES ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS. AND ENHANCE THEIR DATA REPORTING TO THE DEPARTMENT TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION WE NEED TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE AT THIS TIME R. LASTLY DH YES WILL INSURE HER MAGELLAN IS HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR ALL CONTRACTUAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. ARE AND THEIR CURRENT DEFICIENCIES. ARE THERE NOW IT WILL TRANSITION INTO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS REGARDING THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT ALL. OF THE DEPARTMENT- IS NOT PROPOSING TO AUGMENT THE ANNUAL HUNDRED AND A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR TOTAL FUND- ADDS ORIGINALLY PROPOSED IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT ALL. WE HAVE SUBMITTED THE STATE PLAN- TO YOU- CMS AND IT EXPLICITLY INCLUDES- THE ANNUAL AMOUNT OF A HUNDRED BILLION OTHER DEPARTMENT ANTICIPATES APPROVAL OF STATE PLAN AMENDMENT IN THE FIRST QUARTER.

THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF FULL FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR EACH FISCAL YEAR OTHER CRITERIA FOR ALLOCATING THE POOL OF FUNDING AMONG THE QUALIFYING AND HOSPITALS REPORT. UNITY CLINICS INCLUDING THE TIMING FREQUENCY AND AMOUNT OF THE RESULT SACRAMENTO PEMEX. APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN NON HOSPITAL THREE FORTY CLINICS I WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT FOR. I WOULD DOUBLE ENTITIES MUST APPLY AND CERTIFY THEIR ELIGIBILITY TO PARTICIPATE. IN THE PROGRAM TO THE DEPARTMENT. IN SUPPLE PAYMENT. OF WILL BE PAID A- OF PURPOSES PROVIDED BY ELIGIBLE CLINICS DURING THE PROGRAM PERIOD. THE FIVE O'CLOCK NEWS THAT SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS WILL BE CALCULATED BASED ON THE TOTAL BILL AMOUNT IF I DID BY THE NUMBER OF VISITS PROVIDED WITHIN THE TECH THAT SERVICE. BASED ON THIS WORK THE DEPARTMENT BELIEVES THE HUNDRED FIVE MILLION DOLLAR SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT IS APPROPRIATE- HERE TO CONTINUE UNDERSTANDING ANY FISCAL IMPACT OF MEDICARE CORRECT ON THE CLINICS AND OTHER PROVIDERS. THE DEPARTMENT IS MONITORING PPS COACHING REQUEST FROM MATTHEW EXCEEDS THE DETERMINE WHETHER CLINICS ARE MODIFYING THE REIMBURSEMENT THEY RECEIVE IN RESPONSE TO. THAT TALLERES.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M- I WILL- SPEND A LITTLE TIME TRYING TO. UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE CONTRACTUAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS- THAT WE HAVE WITH. MAGELLAN HI- KEPT NOTICING DURING THE RIDE UP WITHIN THE AGENDA THAT. OUR STATE STAFF BOTH FOR THE PHARMACY BENEFIT STAFF IN THE MEDICAL. CALL CENTER WERE BEING LOANS TO MAGELLAN DURING OUR ROLL OUT. AND HAVE SOME. CONCERNS LOOKING AT THE F. T. E. IS THAT THEY'RE NEARLY DOUBLING THOSE LEFTIES OVER THE NEXT TWO MONTHS. TO JUST. ATTEMPT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE CONTRACTUAL STANDARDS WERE. IN ADVANCE. SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THEY ARE- MEETING THOSE STANDARDS I'M HOPING YOU CAN. SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THOSE. IF YOU CAN'T. MICHELLE DO YOU WANT ME TO TAKE SOME OF THOSE. SO I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE- A VARIETY OF STANDARDS I THINK THE MOST CRITICAL ONE THAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON BECAUSE I HAVE TO DEAL WITH- INDIVIDUALS BEING ABLE TO GET THEIR MEDICATIONS TIMELY I'M IS REALLY THE TURNAROUND OF PRIOR AUTHORIZATION WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS- AND THAT IS IN A STATE LAW THAT A REQUIREMENT IN STATE LAW FOR THAT TWENTY FOUR HOUR TURNAROUND. ON AND AS MENTIONED THERE THERE CURRENTLY- GREATLY EXCEEDING THAT WITH AROUND THE SEVENTY EIGHT AGING OF THAT PRIOR OFF. ON THERE ARE ALSO A VARIETY OF THE- PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS AROUND THE CALL CENTER- THINK BEING AT A HOLD TIMES AND VARIOUS PIECES I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO GET YOU A LIST OF THE CONTRACT FOR. YOU KNOW- PERFORMANCE INDICATORS OF THE THAT YOU ARE AWARE OF THOSE AND HOW WE WILL BE TRACKING THOSE OVER. THE COMING WEEKS IF THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL- IT WOULD I ALSO. PLEASE GO ORDER. SURE I WOULD BAD- AS PART OF THEIR INVOICE DID THIS. BASEBALL HAVE TO LIST THEIR THE METRICS AS THEY HAVE FOUND AT THE END OF THE MONTH AND THAT'S WHAT WE WILL GO THROUGH KIND OF. ODD THAT THE DISCUSSION ON AND HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR THEIR PERFORMANCE STANDARDS WE WILL BE RECEIVING THAT AND THEN IN THE COMING DAYS. I REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTION TO DETAIL AS WE WERE IMPLEMENTING THIS AND- IDENTIFYING TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE F. T. E. IN REAL TIME. BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CONTRACTED THIRD PARTY HOLD SOME RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS THOSE F. T. E.'S. THAT WE'VE BEEN- SUPPLEMENTING- THROUGH THIS. INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION AND WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS A PART OF THE CONVERSATION GOING FORWARD. EVEN IF THEY'RE GOING TO INCREASE THEIR F. T. E.'S BY NEARLY DOUBLE OVER THE NEXT TWO MONTHS. WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STAFF WE WERE- PROVIDING OR- ALLOWING THEM TO USE TO GET THROUGH THESE GROWING PAINS. ARE ARE. APPROPRIATELY- THE- RESOURCE BY THE THIRD PARTY VENDOR- AS THEY AS AS THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE OUR CONTRACT- SHOULD HAVE STATED AND SO. I'M HOPEFUL THAT I CAN FOLLOW UP ON THAT AS I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GET AN UPDATE. AND FOLLOW UP ON WHEN WE ARE ABLE TO LOWER THOSE PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS BELOW TWENTY FOUR HOURS AGAIN HI- AND- FLEXIBLE AND REASONABLE TO GIVE SPACE TO WORK THROUGH THESE GROWING PAINS BUT- ALSO NOW WE HAVE CERTAIN STANDARDS TO UPHOLD FOR. OUR PATIENTS AND WOULD LIKE YOUR CONTINUED ATTENTION- BUT- MAYBE I'LL JUST BROADLY ASK HOW HOW SOON DO YOU THINK. OR EXPECT THESE CHALLENGES TO BE RESOLVED IT SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE A TWO MONTH PLAN HERE FOR FEBRUARY AND MARCH. BUT CAN YOU GENERALLY- COMMENT ON WHAT YOUR EXPECTATIONS ARE FOR THE NEXT TWO MONTHS. I WOULD SAY IN THE IN THE NEXT. TWO DAYS WHEN WE UNDERSTAND HOW THE CHANGES OVER THE WEEKEND WILL REALLY IMPACT OUR INCOMING PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUESTS I THINK BY THAT- YOU KNOW THE CONVENE WEEKS OR SO A WEEK OR SO WE SHOULD KNOW MORE ABOUT HOW. THE CHANGES WE IMPLEMENTED THIS THIS WEEKEND REALLY IMPACT THE KIND OF THE ON GOING WORK WELL AS WE THINK THROUGH THE LONG TERM PLAN AND I WILL SAY. WE ARE DEFINITELY I HAVE MADE IT CLEAR TO OUR CONTRACTOR THAT AS PART OF THEIR WORK PLAN DEVELOPMENT THEY NEED TO ACCOUNT FOR KIND OF BUT- THE DHS STAFF REALLY NOT BEING PART OF THAT KIND OF THEIR ON GOING SOLUTION AND SO WE ARE. I'M GONNA MONITOR THAT VERY CLOSELY. YEAH THING I WOULD ADD IS WE'VE ALSO MADE IT VERY CLEAR TO YOUR- APPOINT THAT THEREWILL BE- YOU KNOW POTENTIAL WITHHOLDS FROM THE- INVOICE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE CLASS. THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS. ON HAD TO BEAR. A LOT FOR THE ACT HE'S AS WELL AS UP FOR BOTH ON THE CUSTOMER SERVICE SIDE AS WELL AS THE PRIDE ROCKSLIDES. I JUST WANTED TO BE REALLY CLEAR. AND REGARD THAT IF WE WERE BEFORE THEY GOT. YOU ON OUR EXPECTATIONS WITHOUT FIRST INVOICE COMING IN FROM THE JALAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M FINE FINAL QUESTION. OF IT IT'S- YOU STATED THAT THE HAND WHEN TIMES WERE LONGER BY EIGHTY FIVE TO A HUNDRED. PERCENT THAT'S THAT'S NEARLY TWICE AS LONG AND I'M WONDERING IF THERE WAS ANYTHING. SYSTEMATICALLY THAT LED TOWARDS THOSE LONGER HANDLING TIMES OR WHY THAT- ONE. PARTICULAR DATA POINTS WAS- NOT CONSISTENT. THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION. YEAH I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING MOSTLY IS JUST- THAT LARGE NUMBER OF STAFF COMING ON IN THE TRAINING NEEDED I'M MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE EASIER TOOL KITS ARE FOR THEM- CRITERIA. OF WHAT WE'VE DONE AS WE CONTINUE TO DO AGAIN IS THE DECISION TO OR ARE WITHIN THE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION IS PROBABLY OVER ENGINEERED IN THE LITTLE TOO COMPLICATED- SO WE ARE WORKING TO STREAMLINE THAT. OF WHICH WE ARE HOPING- THAT THAT. OUR MAGELLAN IS WORKING STREAMLINED THAT I SHOULD SAY- AND WE'RE HOPING THAT THAT WILL RESULT IN YOUR REVIEWS- AND THEY HAVE ON THE JOHN HAS BROUGHT ON. A LOT OF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT IN FACT WITHIN JUST A WEEK OF THE THROUGH PUT- A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE FROM WHAT WAS BEING SEEN AS AROUND. EIGHT HUNDRED TO NEARLY THREE THOUSAND OFFER YOU PUT ON THOSE PRIOR OFF THE WERE HOPING AT THESE TOOLKITS. ACTIVISION ADJUSTABLE ACHIEVEMENTS ARE MADE IT WILL ALLOW FOR A HIGHER THROUGHPUT THAN WHAT WE ARE SEEING IN THE EARLIER WEEKS WHICH REALLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE SIGNIFICANT BACKLOG WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DIG OUT OF.
