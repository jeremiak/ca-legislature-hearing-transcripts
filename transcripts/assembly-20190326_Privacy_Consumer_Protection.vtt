THE ONLY PROBLEM THAT I HAD WITH

THE RULES IS A CHANGE THAT WAS

00:29:19.924 --> 00:29:21.659

SET THE BILL AND SO I'M

00:29:33.872 --> 00:29:34.405
WONDERING WHY THAT CHANGE WAS

00:29:34.472 --> 00:29:43.248
MADE.

00:29:43.314 --> 00:29:45.650
SAYS THE TO SAY TO A YES TO A

00:29:45.717 --> 00:29:47.252
HASN'T BEEN CHANGED IN FACT WAS

00:29:47.318 --> 00:29:50.655
TO BE THAT IT'S BEEN MODIFIED.

00:29:50.722 --> 00:29:52.957
IS TO BE THAT THE US -- HAS BEEN

00:29:53.024 --> 00:29:54.192
SLIGHTLY ALTERED.

00:29:54.259 --> 00:29:55.894
ALL.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.128
AND I THINK THAT WAS WERE

00:29:57.195 --> 00:30:03.101
DELETED ALSO.

00:30:03.168 --> 00:30:04.869
RIGHT SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

00:30:04.936 --> 00:30:06.371
SAME THING SO IT WORKS THERE WAS

00:30:06.437 --> 00:30:08.139
A PROVISION THAT SAID THAT --

00:30:08.206 --> 00:30:09.674
THE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN SHALL SET

00:30:09.741 --> 00:30:11.776
A BILL FOR HEARING AND THAT'S

00:30:11.843 --> 00:30:14.012
BEEN CHANGED TO MAY -- AND

00:30:14.078 --> 00:30:15.680
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I HAVE A

00:30:15.747 --> 00:30:16.614
FUNDAMENTALLY FISSILE

00:30:16.681 --> 00:30:17.949
PHILOSOPHICAL DISAGREEMENT WITH

00:30:18.016 --> 00:30:19.250
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE AN

00:30:19.317 --> 00:30:21.352
OBLIGATION TO HEAR ANY BILL THAT

00:30:21.419 --> 00:30:22.320
HAS BEEN AUTHORED BY A MEMBER OF

00:30:22.387 --> 00:30:23.788
THE LEGISLATURE THAT'S BEEN A

00:30:23.855 --> 00:30:24.989
LONG STANDING CUSTOMER PRACTICE.

00:30:25.056 --> 00:30:26.491
BOTH IN THE LEGISLATURE IN THIS

00:30:26.558 --> 00:30:29.093
COMMITTEE AND AND I OBJECTED

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.261
BEING CHANGED.

00:30:30.328 --> 00:30:31.196
I BELIEVE THAT'S THE HALLWAYS

00:30:31.262 --> 00:30:33.097
RULE THAT WAS RECENTLY ADOPTED

00:30:33.164 --> 00:30:34.966
BUT AS FAR AS A COMEDIAN WHOSE --

00:30:35.033 --> 00:30:39.170
WE WE ARE SILENT ON THAT

00:30:39.237 --> 00:30:41.306
PARTICULAR A PROVISION

00:30:41.372 --> 00:30:41.606
[inaudible]

00:30:41.673 --> 00:30:57.789
CORRECT

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:12.036
.

00:31:12.036 --> 00:31:12.604
I STILL THINK WE'RE REPORT TALK

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:15.406
ABOUT THE SAME -- BEFORE WE SO

00:31:15.473 --> 00:31:16.908
WE HAD A PROVISION THAT SAID

00:31:16.975 --> 00:31:17.575

THIS COMMITTEE AND WE'RE

00:31:18.643 --> 00:31:20.111
PROPOSING TO REMOVE THEM WHICH

00:31:20.178 --> 00:31:21.913
IS WHY I OBJECT TO THAT.

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:22.513
AND I REALIZE THAT THAT'S AN

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.482
ACTION THAT THE ASSEMBLY TOOK IN

00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:25.883
ITS RULES BUT THAT DOESN'T

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:26.651
NECESSARILY MEAN THAT WERE

CERTAINLY BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY.

00:38:36.147 --> 00:38:36.814
HI TECH ALSO QUESTION ABOUT

00:38:36.881 --> 00:38:38.649
SUBSECTION BE OF THE BILL THEN

00:38:38.716 --> 00:38:39.350
I'LL READ IT TO YOU BECAUSE IT'S

00:38:39.417 --> 00:38:40.217
ABOUT THE LANGUAGE THAT I'M

00:38:40.284 --> 00:38:41.485
ASKING ABOUT ITSAYS.

00:38:41.552 --> 00:38:43.120
THIS SECTION DOES NOT APPLY TO A

00:38:43.187 --> 00:38:45.289
TIRE MOUNTED ON A WHEEL OR RIM

00:38:45.356 --> 00:38:46.390
THAT IS TEMPORARY WORK

00:38:46.457 --> 00:38:47.692
TEMPORARILY REMOVED FROM THE

00:38:47.758 --> 00:38:48.959
VEHICLE AND REINSTALLED IN THE

00:38:49.026 --> 00:38:50.528
SAME VEHICLE.

00:38:50.594 --> 00:38:51.962
SO OBVIOUSLY WE'RE TRYING -- TO

00:38:52.029 --> 00:38:53.964
EXEMPT PEOPLE THAT ALREADY HAD

00:38:54.031 --> 00:38:55.099
THE TIRE ON A ROOM WE'RE TAKING

00:38:55.166 --> 00:38:56.100
THE ROOM OFF FOR SOME REASON

00:38:56.167 --> 00:38:57.535
DIDN'T WORK ON THE THE BREAK OR

00:38:57.601 --> 00:38:59.070
SOMETHING AND PUTTING IT BACK ON

00:38:59.136 --> 00:38:59.637
SO I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE

00:38:59.704 --> 00:39:01.138
TRYING TO DO BUT MY POINT IS

00:39:01.205 --> 00:39:02.173
THAT.

00:39:02.239 --> 00:39:03.574
IT'S AMBIGUOUS WHETHER OR NOT.

00:39:03.641 --> 00:39:06.343
THAT EXEMPTION APPLIES.

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:08.646
TO THE TIRE FOR THE RAM SO IT

00:39:08.713 --> 00:39:09.246
SAYS.

00:39:09.313 --> 00:39:10.781
DOES NOT APPLY TO A TIRE A RAM

00:39:10.848 --> 00:39:12.016
TEMPORARILY REMOVED THE VEHICLE

00:39:12.083 --> 00:39:13.084
SO YOU COULD INTERPRET THAT TO

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:14.952
MEAN IF YOU TEMPORARILY REMOVED

00:39:15.019 --> 00:39:16.420
THE RAM.

00:39:16.487 --> 00:39:17.455
CHANGE THE TIRE BUT PUT THE SAME

00:39:17.521 --> 00:39:18.622
RAN BACK ON THE VEHICLE THAT

00:39:18.689 --> 00:39:19.690
THAT WOULD BE EXEMPT WHICH I'M

00:39:19.757 --> 00:39:21.425
SURE IS NOT YOUR INTENTION SO I

00:39:21.492 --> 00:39:22.259
ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT

00:39:22.326 --> 00:39:23.427
THAT AS A BILL MOVES FORWARD

00:39:23.494 --> 00:39:26.764
BECAUSE I THINK THAT LANGUAGE

00:39:26.831 --> 00:39:27.498
NEEDS TO BE TIED UP.

00:39:27.565 --> 00:39:28.866
THAT WAS ACTUALLY BROUGHT BY THE

00:39:28.933 --> 00:39:29.500
TIRE DEALERS AND THAT'S WHEN THE

00:39:29.567 --> 00:39:30.735
TECHNICAL CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS

00:39:30.801 --> 00:39:32.536

PROTECTION MEASURE.

00:39:47.952 --> 00:39:50.187
AND I THINK IT MAKES SENSE ALSO

00:39:50.254 --> 00:39:51.555
TO SHIFT PART OF THE

00:39:51.622 --> 00:39:53.991

00:44:03.474 --> 00:44:04.141
REALLY CAME FROM.

00:44:04.208 --> 00:44:05.109
WE DON'T WANT TO BE IN A SIMILAR

00:44:28.699 --> 00:44:29.800
THE THING.

00:44:29.867 --> 00:44:31.335
THANK YOU AGAIN AND WE BELIEVE

00:44:31.402 --> 00:44:32.903
THAT THE GOVERNMENT ISSUED ID

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:34.405
NUMBERS SUCH AS YOUR PASSPORT

00:44:34.471 --> 00:44:35.506
NUMBER AND YOUR BIOMETRIC

00:44:35.572 --> 00:44:37.041
INFORMATION ARE EXACTLY THE

00:44:37.107 --> 00:44:38.876
KINDS OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

00:44:38.942 --> 00:44:40.377
THAT SHOULD BE AND HISTORICALLY.

00:44:40.444 --> 00:44:42.479
HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE LAW AND

00:44:42.546 --> 00:44:44.048
AND BOTH OF THESE REQUIREMENTS

00:44:44.114 --> 00:44:45.349
IN THE DATA BREACH ON VACATION

00:44:45.416 --> 00:44:46.517
Là AND THE REASONABLE DATA

00:44:46.583 --> 00:44:47.684
SECURITY LAW.

00:44:47.751 --> 00:44:49.119
THIS IS DATA THAT IS USED AS AN

00:44:49.186 --> 00:44:50.954
IDENTIFIER BUT ALSO AS A FORM OF

00:44:51.021 --> 00:44:52.756
IDENTITY AUTHENTICATION FOR

00:44:52.823 --> 00:44:54.224
EXAMPLE WHEN I GO TO A CREDITOR

00:44:54.291 --> 00:44:55.492
AND THEY SAY.

00:44:55.559 --> 00:44:56.727
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THIS IS THE

00:44:56.794 --> 00:44:58.729
RIGHT SPECIES AFTER I GIVE THEM

00:44:58.796 --> 00:44:59.997
MY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER?

00:45:00.064 --> 00:45:01.498
IN SOMECASES I VERIFY MY

00:45:01.565 --> 00:45:03.100
IDENTITY BY TELLING THEM WHAT MY

00:45:03.167 --> 00:45:04.768
DRIVER'S LICENSE NUMBER IS OR MY

00:45:04.835 --> 00:45:06.236
PASSPORT INFORMATION.

00:45:06.303 --> 00:45:07.571
THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION IS WHAT

00:45:07.638 --> 00:45:09.239
SOMEONE CAN ALSO USED TO STEAL

00:45:09.306 --> 00:45:11.375
MY IDENTITY AND COMMIT FRAUD AND

00:45:11.442 --> 00:45:12.409
SO IT IS IMPORTANT THAT

00:45:12.476 --> 00:45:14.812
COMPANIES NUMBER ONE PROTECT AT

00:45:14.878 --> 00:45:16.346
AND NUMBER TWO TELL ME IF

00:45:16.413 --> 00:45:18.082
THEY'VE BEEN BREACH SO I CAN

00:45:18.148 --> 00:45:19.550
TAKE STEPS TO PROTECT MYSELF.

00:45:19.616 --> 00:45:20.684
WE KNOW THAT THIS TYPE OF

00:45:20.751 --> 00:45:22.619
IDENTITY VERIFICATION OR RELYING

00:45:22.686 --> 00:45:24.188
ON IDENTIFYING NUMBERS THAT ARE

00:45:24.254 --> 00:45:25.522
SUPPOSED TO BE SECRET.

00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:27.024
BUT SOMETIMES ARE ACTUALLY KNOWN

00:45:27.091 --> 00:45:28.325
TO MANY IS NOT THE MOST

00:45:28.392 --> 00:45:30.394
EFFECTIVE BUT THIS IS THE METHOD

00:45:30.461 --> 00:45:31.795
THAT STILL USE AND SO WHY

00:45:31.862 --> 00:45:33.230
SECURITY AND IDENTITY

00:45:33.297 --> 00:45:34.798
VERIFICATION ARE IMPROVING FROM

00:45:34.865 --> 00:45:36.266
THINGS THAT WE HAVE.

00:45:36.333 --> 00:45:37.601
LIKE PHYSICAL OBJECTS SUCH AS

00:45:37.668 --> 00:45:38.902
CREDIT CARDS OR THINGS THAT WE

00:45:38.969 --> 00:45:40.771
KNOW SUCH AS PASSPORTS AND

00:45:40.838 --> 00:45:42.206
NUMBERS.

00:45:42.272 --> 00:45:43.774
THERE ARE ALSO A BALDING TWO

00:45:43.841 --> 00:45:46.844
THINGS THAT WE ARE SUCH AS OUR

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:47.711
BIOMETRIC DATA.

00:45:47.778 --> 00:45:48.645
THIS IS WHY RIGHT NOW WE NEED TO

00:45:48.712 --> 00:45:50.581
WORK TO PROTECT ALL OF IT.

00:45:50.647 --> 00:45:52.282
AMENDING THE STATUTE IS CRITICAL

00:45:52.349 --> 00:45:53.784
BOTH BECAUSE OF THE LESSONS THAT

00:45:53.851 --> 00:45:55.486

00:46:03.393 --> 00:46:04.461
IT IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT FOR

00:46:04.528 --> 00:46:06.096
CONSUMERS THAT BOTH STATUES

00:46:06.163 --> 00:46:08.031

AN OBLIGATION ON BUSINESSES TO

00:46:12.469 --> 00:46:14.071

00:48:10.053 --> 00:48:10.787

CERTAINLY APPRECIATE AND

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:20.797
UNDERSTAND THE AUTHOR SCHOOL YOU

00:48:20.864 --> 00:48:21.965
TURN THE GENERAL SCHOOL TO

00:48:22.032 --> 00:48:22.966
ENSURE.

00:48:23.033 --> 00:48:24.801
NOTIFICATION OF DATA BREACHES OF

00:48:24.868 --> 00:48:26.737
PASSPORTS AND BIOMETRIC DATA IF

00:48:26.803 --> 00:48:28.839
IT'S MORE PRECISELY DEFINED --

00:48:28.905 --> 00:48:30.274
BUT RIGHT NOW OUR CONCERN IS THE

00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:31.842
LANGUAGE OF AB ELEVEN THIRTY IS

00:48:31.908 --> 00:48:33.110
OVER BROAD IN IT THIS BILL

00:48:33.176 --> 00:48:34.177
CERTAINLY GOES BEYOND REACH

00:48:34.244 --> 00:48:35.912
NOTIFICATION -- IT CREATES

00:48:35.979 --> 00:48:37.381
ADDITIONAL LIABILITY TO

00:48:37.447 --> 00:48:39.149
BUSINESSES UNDER THE CALIFORNIA

00:48:39.216 --> 00:48:41.018
CONSUMER PRIVACY ACTS ONEROUS

00:48:41.084 --> 00:48:42.686
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WHICH

00:48:42.753 --> 00:48:43.787
MEANS THE ANY BREACH OR

00:48:43.854 --> 00:48:45.055
DISCLOSURE OF THE STATE WILL

00:48:45.122 --> 00:48:46.056
LEAD TO A LAWSUIT WERE IN

00:48:46.123 --> 00:48:47.457
PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEYS DON'T HAVE

00:48:47.524 --> 00:48:48.925
TO PROVE ANY INJURY.

00:48:48.992 --> 00:48:51.161
AND SIGNIFICANT MINIMUM

00:48:51.228 --> 00:48:52.929
STATUTORY DAMAGES CAN BE AWARDED --

00:48:52.996 --> 00:48:54.698
WE DON'T OBJECT TO THE NOTION

00:48:54.765 --> 00:48:55.799
THAT THIS TYPE OF DATA SHOULD

00:48:55.866 --> 00:48:57.234
HAVE REASONABLE SECURITY BUT WE

00:48:57.301 --> 00:48:59.102
OBJECT TO THIS SIGNIFICANT

00:48:59.169 --> 00:49:00.737
LIABILITY THAT WOULD BE PLACED.

00:49:00.804 --> 00:49:03.373
ON FOR EXAMPLE BIOMETRIC DATA

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:05.042
UNDER THE C. P. AND AND WHAT WE

00:49:05.108 --> 00:49:06.610
HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS IF WE DO

00:49:06.677 --> 00:49:07.911
THAT WE'RE GOING TO DISCOURAGE

00:49:07.978 --> 00:49:09.379
THE USE OF BIOMETRIC DATA AS AN

00:49:09.446 --> 00:49:10.947
AUTHENTICATOR IT IS A SAFER WAY

00:49:11.014 --> 00:49:12.082
TO AUTHENTICATE IDENTITY THAN A

00:49:12.149 --> 00:49:13.784
SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER.

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:14.718
UNLIKE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS

00:49:14.785 --> 00:49:16.320
BIOMETRIC DATA IS NOT A ONE SIZE

00:49:16.386 --> 00:49:17.554
FITS ALL IDENTIFIER THERE ARE

00:49:17.621 --> 00:49:20.457
MANY KINDS OF BIOMETRIC DATA NOT

00:49:20.524 --> 00:49:21.425
ONE AND SO THEREFORE THE BREACH

00:49:21.491 --> 00:49:22.859
OF ONE PARTICULAR TYPE OF THAT

00:49:22.926 --> 00:49:24.027
DATA DOES NOT CREATE.

00:49:24.094 --> 00:49:25.529
THE SIGNIFICANT RISK OF IDENTITY

00:49:25.595 --> 00:49:27.331
THEFT OR FRAUD BUT ADDING IT TO

00:49:27.397 --> 00:49:28.231
THE LIST OF ITEMS FOR WHICH A

00:49:28.298 --> 00:49:29.833
COMPANY CAN BE SUED WITH NO

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:31.468
PROOF OF INJURY -- WOULD

00:49:31.535 --> 00:49:33.003
STRONGLY DISCOURAGE THAT

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:34.738
EFFECTIVE PRO PRIVACY SECURITY

00:49:34.805 --> 00:49:35.839
MEASURE.

00:49:35.906 --> 00:49:37.941
MORE IMPORTANTLY THE LANGUAGE

00:49:38.008 --> 00:49:40.077
DEFINING -- BIOMETRIC DATA UNDER

00:49:40.143 --> 00:49:45.682
AB ELEVEN THIRTY IS OVERLY BROAD.

00:49:45.749 --> 00:49:46.383
REFERENCE TO ANY UNIQUE PHYSICAL

00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:46.917
REPRESENTATION OR DIGITAL

00:49:46.983 --> 00:49:47.951
REPRESENTATION OF BIOMETRIC DATA

00:49:48.018 --> 00:49:49.219
COULD BE INTERPRETED TO INCLUDE

00:49:49.286 --> 00:49:50.887
PHOTOS OUR BEHAVIORAL DATA IT

00:49:50.954 --> 00:49:52.689
COULD INCLUDE SHOE SIZE OR

00:49:52.756 --> 00:49:54.191
CLOTHING SIZE.

00:49:54.257 --> 00:49:54.958
THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF

00:49:55.025 --> 00:49:56.426
STATE DID REACH NOTIFICATION

00:49:56.493 --> 00:49:58.028
LAWS RECOGNIZE THAT BIO METRIC

00:49:58.095 --> 00:49:59.663
DATA USED TO AUTHENTICATE AN

00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:01.798
INDIVIDUAL IS THE TYPE OF

00:50:01.865 --> 00:50:03.400
BIOMETRIC DATA THAT CREATES THE

00:50:03.467 --> 00:50:04.835
RISK OF IDENTITY THEFT OR FRAUD

00:50:04.901 --> 00:50:06.136
WHICH IS WHAT THE DATA BREACH

00:50:06.203 --> 00:50:07.504
NOTIFICATION Là WAS DESIGNED TO

00:50:07.571 --> 00:50:08.739
COMBAT.

00:50:08.805 --> 00:50:10.173
WITHOUT THIS LIMITING ELEMENT TO

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:11.608
THAT DEFINITION IT WOULD INCLUDE

00:50:11.675 --> 00:50:12.576
OTHER TYPES OF MEASUREMENTS

00:50:12.642 --> 00:50:14.111
AGAIN LIKE THAT A CLOTHING STORE

00:50:14.177 --> 00:50:16.713
AN OPTOMETRIST MIGHT HAVE THAT

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:18.982
WOULD NOT POSE A RISK OF HARM --

00:50:19.049 --> 00:50:22.219
AND FINALLY -- RIGHT NOW AB

00:50:22.285 --> 00:50:22.786
ELEVEN THIRTY WOULD ADD ALL

00:50:22.853 --> 00:50:24.020
GOVERNMENT ISSUED IDENTIFICATION

00:50:24.087 --> 00:50:27.357
NUMBERS TO THIS LIST -- AND OUR

00:50:27.424 --> 00:50:28.825

00:50:28.892 --> 00:50:30.160
IT'S GONNA I MEAN THAT WOULD BE

ANY GOVERNMENT ISSUED I'D ANY

00:50:31.928 --> 00:50:33.764
GOVERNMENT ISSUED IDENTIFICATION

CASE NUMBER FROM ANY LEVEL OF

00:50:34.631 --> 00:50:35.332
GOVERNMENT.

00:50:35.399 --> 00:50:36.533
EVEN IF IT DOESN'T POSE A RISK

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:37.968
OF HARM LIKE A FISHING LICENSE

00:50:38.034 --> 00:50:39.803
OR PROFESSIONAL LICENSE NUMBER

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:40.337
WE THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE

00:50:40.404 --> 00:50:44.374
NARROWED AS WELL -- BUT AGAIN.

00:50:44.441 --> 00:50:46.143

00:53:01.444 --> 00:53:05.115
WHAT OTHER KITE TYPES OF THINGS?

00:53:05.181 --> 00:53:06.917
THOROUGH BIOMETRIC DATA.

00:53:06.983 --> 00:53:07.751
I HAVE TO LIST.

00:53:07.817 --> 00:53:10.053
THEM FOR EXAMPLE THE THE

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:12.188
DEFINITION OF IT -- IT CAN

00:53:12.255 --> 00:53:13.523
INCLUDE THINGS LIKE FINGERPRINT

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:15.392
YOUR DNA FACE RECOGNITION PALM

00:53:15.458 --> 00:53:16.626
PRINTS.

00:53:16.693 --> 00:53:18.295
IRIS RECOGNITION YOUR HAND

00:53:18.361 --> 00:53:22.332
GEOMETRY -- YOUR IN SOME CASES

00:53:22.399 --> 00:53:24.801
D. ANALYSIS -- YOUR VOICE THESE

00:53:24.868 --> 00:53:25.769
ARE ALL.

00:53:25.835 --> 00:53:27.070
THINGS THAT ARE HUMAN BEHAVIORAL

00:53:27.137 --> 00:53:29.773
CHARACTERISTICS THAT CAN BE USED

00:53:29.839 --> 00:53:31.274
AS A DATA POINT TO IDENTIFY

00:53:31.341 --> 00:53:33.577
AUTHENTICATE AND VERIFY THAT YOU

00:53:33.643 --> 00:53:35.045
ARE WHO YOU SAY YOU ARE.

00:53:35.111 --> 00:53:37.013
AND SO THESE ARE ARE THINGS THAT

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:38.582
ARE ARE REQUIRE SOME LEVEL OF

00:53:38.648 --> 00:53:39.616
PROCESSING SOME TECHNICAL

00:53:39.683 --> 00:53:40.951
PROCESSING WHICH IS REFLECTED IN

00:53:41.017 --> 00:53:43.019
THE DEFINITION -- AND THAT IS

00:53:43.086 --> 00:53:44.754
WHAT WHAT IS SEEK TO ENCOMPASS

00:53:44.821 --> 00:53:46.623
IN IN IN TERMS OF ADDING THIS

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:47.123
NEW POINT.

00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:49.259
RED BUT IN A VACUUM SOME OF

00:53:49.326 --> 00:53:51.294
THOSE THINGS MIGHT NOT IDENTIFY

00:53:51.361 --> 00:53:52.195
YOU LIKE.

00:53:52.262 --> 00:53:53.263
YOU KNOW SOMEONE MIGHT GET A

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:55.498
COPY OF MY FINGERPRINT RIGHT BUT

00:53:55.565 --> 00:53:56.766
THEY DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S MINE

00:53:56.833 --> 00:54:00.070
RIGHT ABSENT SOMETHING THAT

00:54:00.136 --> 00:54:00.770
CONNECTS IT.

00:54:00.837 --> 00:54:01.571
RIGHT THAT RIGHT SO IS IS THE

00:54:01.638 --> 00:54:03.239
BREACH IF YOU WILL UNDER THIS

00:54:03.306 --> 00:54:04.708
LEGISLATION [inaudible]

00:54:04.774 --> 00:54:06.509
JUST.

00:54:06.576 --> 00:54:08.244
THAT THING IN ITSELF FOR ONLY IF

00:54:08.311 --> 00:54:09.312
IT SOMEHOW.

00:54:09.379 --> 00:54:11.982
CAN BE TRACED BACK TO SOMEBODY

00:54:12.048 --> 00:54:12.816
I'M SORRY I DON'T UNDERSTAND A

00:54:12.882 --> 00:54:14.718
QUESTION THE STATUTE DOES SPEAK

00:54:14.784 --> 00:54:16.419
TO THAT SO IN TERMS OF HOW THE

00:54:16.486 --> 00:54:17.253
DEFINITION OF PERSONAL

00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:19.055
INFORMATION IS UNDER THE THE

00:54:19.122 --> 00:54:19.689
FRAMEWORK.

00:54:19.756 --> 00:54:22.892
IT'S YOUR NAME PLUS THE UNIQUE

00:54:22.959 --> 00:54:25.061
BIOMETRIC DATA OKAY.

00:54:25.128 --> 00:54:27.464
BUT THERE THE MAN MAYBE TO MISS

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:28.665
BIT THIS.

00:54:28.732 --> 00:54:31.368
YOUR YOUR ISSUE IS THAT WERE.

00:54:31.434 --> 00:54:32.736
THIS IS PRETTY BROAD IN TERMS OF

00:54:32.802 --> 00:54:34.204
WHAT CAN BE CONSIDERED BIOMETRIC

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:35.672
DATA AND YOU'D LIKE TO SEE IT

00:54:35.739 --> 00:54:37.340
MORE TIGHTENED DOES THAT EXACTLY

00:54:37.407 --> 00:54:40.210
WE WE'D LIKE IT TO BE TIGHTENED

00:54:40.276 --> 00:54:41.311
TO THE TYPE OF BIOMETRIC DATA

00:54:41.378 --> 00:54:44.047
LIKE -- RETINAL SCAN YOU KNOW IS

00:54:44.114 --> 00:54:44.914
AN EXAMPLE OF THE TYPE OF BY

00:54:44.981 --> 00:54:46.016
MUCH OF DATA THAT'S USED TO

00:54:46.082 --> 00:54:48.051
IDENTIFY A PERSON NOT LIKE BROWN

00:54:48.118 --> 00:54:49.886
HAIR NINE MY SHOE SIZE MY

00:54:49.953 --> 00:54:51.187
SERVING SIZE LIKE ALL THESE

00:54:51.254 --> 00:54:52.322
OTHER THINGS.

00:54:52.389 --> 00:54:53.790
NOT A PHOTOGRAPH.

00:54:53.857 --> 00:54:55.058
YOU KNOW SOMEONE SPACE UNLESS

00:54:55.125 --> 00:54:56.493
IT'S LIKE -- YOU KNOW ONE OF

00:54:56.559 --> 00:54:57.894
THOSE SCANNED PHOTO LIKE WHERE

00:54:57.961 --> 00:54:59.329
THEY HAVE SOME KIND OF IMAGING

00:54:59.396 --> 00:55:00.196
OF YOUR FACE.

00:55:00.263 --> 00:55:01.398
YOU KNOW SOMETHING WHERE THEY'RE

00:55:01.464 --> 00:55:02.999
USING IT TO SCAN YOUR FACE AND

00:55:03.066 --> 00:55:04.734
IDENTIFY YOU NATURAL PICTURE OF

00:55:04.801 --> 00:55:06.302
SOMEONE LIKE WE DON'T THINK THAT

00:55:06.369 --> 00:55:08.338
SHOULD BE BIOMETRIC DATA OKAY.

00:55:08.405 --> 00:55:09.539
IN AND THEN GOOD WELL I JUST

00:55:09.606 --> 00:55:10.573
WANT.

00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:13.143
TO POINT OUT THAT MICHELLE SURE

00:55:13.209 --> 00:55:14.377
DID HAVE A RESPONSE OKAY POINT

00:55:14.444 --> 00:55:15.311
IF YOU IF YOU LIKE SURE

00:55:15.378 --> 00:55:16.913
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT I I THINK IT'S

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:18.481
IMPORTANT TO DISCUSS AND TAKE

00:55:18.548 --> 00:55:19.916
TAKE ON THAT A SHOE SIZE OR

00:55:19.983 --> 00:55:21.017
CLOTHING SIZE THAT IS NOT

00:55:21.084 --> 00:55:22.318
CONSIDERED BIOMETRIC DATA LIKE

00:55:22.385 --> 00:55:23.787
FOR EXAMPLE.

00:55:23.853 --> 00:55:24.587
I'M GOING TO JUST USE MYSELF AS

00:55:24.654 --> 00:55:25.255
AN EXAMPLE.

00:55:25.321 --> 00:55:27.791
I AM A SIZE NINE SHOE AND NINE

00:55:27.857 --> 00:55:28.992
WEST BUT I'M A NINE AND A HALF

00:55:29.059 --> 00:55:30.427
SHE WHEN CLARKSON SO WOULD BE

00:55:30.493 --> 00:55:32.062
VERY DIFFICULT TO KNOW THAT BY

00:55:32.128 --> 00:55:33.830
THE SIZE OF MY FOOT.

00:55:33.897 --> 00:55:34.798
THAT THAT THAT'S EASY RIGHT

00:55:34.864 --> 00:55:36.833
THERE AND SO THAT IS NOT

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:38.101
SOMETHING THAT WOULD FALL INTO

00:55:38.168 --> 00:55:40.970
THE DEFINITION OF BIOMETRIC DATA --

00:55:41.037 --> 00:55:42.405
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S

00:55:42.472 --> 00:55:44.140
PERMANENT OR UNIQUE OR

00:55:44.207 --> 00:55:45.175
COLLECTIBLE IT'S SOMETHING THAT

00:55:45.241 --> 00:55:46.910
WOULD WOULD VERY BASED ON YOU

00:55:46.976 --> 00:55:48.845
KNOW THE BRAND OF THE SHOE SIZE

00:55:48.912 --> 00:55:50.246
OF THE BRAND OF THE SHOE AND AND

00:55:50.313 --> 00:55:51.581
WHATNOT SO.

00:55:51.648 --> 00:55:54.117
THE TYPE OF DATA YOU KNOW IT IS

00:55:54.184 --> 00:55:56.052
SOMETHING THAT IS IS IS DEEPLY

00:55:56.119 --> 00:55:57.353
UNIQUE AN INTRINSIC TO THE

00:55:57.420 --> 00:56:04.227
PERSON AS OPPOSED.

00:56:04.294 --> 00:56:06.663
TO SOMETHING THAT IS -- MUTABLE

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:07.897
IN IN THE IS FASCINATING -- AS

00:56:07.964 --> 00:56:08.832
IT IS TO TALK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE

00:56:08.898 --> 00:56:09.532
WE ALL HAVE SOME PERSONAL

00:56:09.599 --> 00:56:12.135
CONNECTION TO WHAT WHAT IS OUR

00:56:12.202 --> 00:56:13.737
BODY YOU AND YOU KNOW IT'S

00:56:13.803 --> 00:56:14.304
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN JUST

00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:16.372
PHILOSOPHICALLY TALK AT GREAT

00:56:16.439 --> 00:56:16.606
LENGTH.

00:56:16.673 --> 00:56:17.974
ABOUT.

00:56:18.041 --> 00:56:19.809
AS MUCH AS WERE NEGOTIATING OR

00:56:19.876 --> 00:56:20.710
TALKING ABOUT HOW WE WOULD DO

00:56:20.777 --> 00:56:22.512
THAT HERE AT THIS TABLE THAT IS

00:56:22.579 --> 00:56:23.947
EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE NEGOTIATING

00:56:24.013 --> 00:56:25.348
AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT TO MAKE

00:56:25.415 --> 00:56:27.484
SURE THAT WE LAND -- OUGHT WITH

00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:29.886
APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE AND I'VE

00:56:29.953 --> 00:56:31.054
GOT GREAT FAITH IN THE

00:56:31.121 --> 00:56:32.355
PARTNERSHIP THAT WE HAVE WITH

00:56:32.422 --> 00:56:33.857
THE CHAMBER THAT WHILE WE MISSED

00:56:33.923 --> 00:56:35.525
THE HIGH FIVE GOING BY EACH

00:56:35.592 --> 00:56:36.359
OTHER THE FIRST TIME WE'RE GONNA

00:56:36.426 --> 00:56:37.327
GET BACK.

00:56:37.393 --> 00:56:40.697
AND AND HIT THAT HIGH FIVE ON

00:56:40.764 --> 00:56:43.433
THAT SECOND SECOND TRY -- WHAT

00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:46.002
DO YOU UNDERSTAND IS THE WHAT IS

00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:48.037
THE CONSEQUENCE?

00:56:48.104 --> 00:56:49.706
IF YOU DO VIOLATE THIS.

00:56:49.773 --> 00:56:51.307
AS YOU UNDERSTAND IT UNDER THIS

00:56:51.374 --> 00:56:52.942
LEGISLATION WHAT WOULD BE THE

00:56:53.009 --> 00:56:57.147
CONSEQUENCE FOR SOMEONE THAT DID --

00:56:57.213 --> 00:56:58.748
SO THEY HAVE THIS BREACH IN YEAH

00:56:58.815 --> 00:57:01.251
SO IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE

00:57:01.317 --> 00:57:02.919
CURRENT DATA BREACH OF VACATION

00:57:02.986 --> 00:57:04.220
Là.

00:57:04.287 --> 00:57:06.756
BUSINESSES NEED TO HAVE

00:57:06.823 --> 00:57:08.725
REASONABLE PROTECTIONS.

00:57:08.792 --> 00:57:11.060
AND SO THAT IS THAT IS MERELY

00:57:11.127 --> 00:57:12.629
WHAT WE ARE ASKING FOR THAT IF

00:57:12.695 --> 00:57:13.930
YOU'RE GOING TO BE COLLECTING.

00:57:13.997 --> 00:57:15.465
GOVERNMENT ISSUED IDENTIFICATION

00:57:15.532 --> 00:57:17.700
NUMBERS OR BIOMETRIC DATA THAT

00:57:17.767 --> 00:57:19.435
YOU USE THIS VERY SAME

00:57:19.502 --> 00:57:21.137
REASONABLE PROTECTIONS THAT

00:57:21.204 --> 00:57:22.772
THEY'RE ALREADY USING.

00:57:22.839 --> 00:57:23.907
FOR HEALTH INSURANCE INFORMATION

00:57:23.973 --> 00:57:25.375
THAT'S WITH YOUR NAME FOR

00:57:25.441 --> 00:57:29.012
EXAMPLE THAT IS THE THE BASIS OF

00:57:29.078 --> 00:57:30.847
WHAT ANYONE IS SUPPOSED TO DO

00:57:30.914 --> 00:57:32.549
AND SO LONG AS THEY'RE ABLE TO

00:57:32.615 --> 00:57:33.716
DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY ARE

00:57:33.783 --> 00:57:35.051
REASONABLY.

00:57:35.118 --> 00:57:36.386
TRYING TO PRACTICE INFORMATION

00:57:36.452 --> 00:57:37.520
THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING THAT

00:57:37.587 --> 00:57:39.255
THERE'S A SUPPOSED TO ALONG WITH

00:57:39.322 --> 00:57:40.490
THE NOTIFICATION OF COURSE AND

00:57:40.557 --> 00:57:43.092
THAT'S I WILL CREDIT IN AMERICA

00:57:43.159 --> 00:57:43.626
READ BUT WHAT WOULD BE THE

00:57:43.693 --> 00:57:44.828
RESULT OF THEY DID.

00:57:44.894 --> 00:57:46.963
UNDER THIS LEGISLATION -- IN THE

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:49.465
THE SAME RECOURSE UNDER THE DATA

00:57:49.532 --> 00:57:52.168
BREACH OF HAITIAN LAW SO -- AND

00:57:52.235 --> 00:57:53.403
I'LL AT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S.

00:57:53.469 --> 00:57:55.104
THE DEPUTY SUPERVISING ATTORNEY

00:57:55.171 --> 00:57:56.372
GENERAL ANSWER THAT IF -- IF

00:57:56.439 --> 00:57:59.776
YOU'D LIKE TO GET MORE INTO THAT

00:57:59.843 --> 00:58:03.213
BUT IT'S IT'S A PRETTY.

00:58:03.279 --> 00:58:06.182
MUCH USING THE EXISTING LAW FROM

00:58:06.249 --> 00:58:06.716
TWO THOUSAND TWO AND JUST

00:58:06.783 --> 00:58:07.717
UPDATING WHAT PEOPLE ARE

00:58:07.784 --> 00:58:10.420
COLLECTING ABOUT SHOW.

00:58:10.486 --> 00:58:11.821
SO IN TERMS OF LEGAL

00:58:11.888 --> 00:58:13.957
CONSEQUENCES -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE

00:58:14.023 --> 00:58:16.059
A ROBUST CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW

00:58:16.125 --> 00:58:17.493
IN THE CAN FOR COMPETITION LAW

00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:19.462
THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR ENFORCEMENT

00:58:19.529 --> 00:58:21.030
ACTIONS TO BE BROUGHT BY THE

00:58:21.097 --> 00:58:22.465
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE OR

00:58:22.532 --> 00:58:23.466
CITY ATTORNEYS ARE DISTRICT

00:58:23.533 --> 00:58:24.901
ATTORNEYS IF THERE'S A VIOLATION

00:58:24.968 --> 00:58:26.870
OF A LOT OF CONSTITUTE UNLAWFUL

00:58:26.936 --> 00:58:28.304
BUSINESS PRACTICE AND SUBJECT.

00:58:28.371 --> 00:58:30.840
A COMPANY -- FOR TO CIVIL

00:58:30.907 --> 00:58:33.209
PENALTIES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF --

00:58:33.276 --> 00:58:34.944
AND SO YOU KNOW IF THERE'S A

00:58:35.011 --> 00:58:36.379
VIOLATION IF IF IF FOR EXAMPLE

00:58:36.446 --> 00:58:38.615
BUSINESS WAS NOT RECENTLY

00:58:38.681 --> 00:58:40.350
PROTECTING BIOMETRIC DATA DATA

00:58:40.416 --> 00:58:43.853
OR GOVERNMENT ISSUED IDENTIFIER --

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:45.455
FOR IT YOU KNOW THEY WERE FOUND

00:58:45.521 --> 00:58:47.624
TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT DELAY AND

00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:48.858
AFTER SUFFERING A BRIDGE AND

00:58:48.925 --> 00:58:50.226
THEY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DELAYED

00:58:50.293 --> 00:58:51.527
AND NOTIFYING THOSE WHO ARE

00:58:51.594 --> 00:58:52.262
AFFECTED.

00:58:52.328 --> 00:58:53.997
THAT COULD CONSTITUTE GROUNDS

00:58:54.063 --> 00:58:55.064
FOR FINDING THAT THERE WAS AN

00:58:55.131 --> 00:58:56.266
UNLAWFUL BUSINESS PRACTICE

00:58:56.332 --> 00:58:57.533
SUBJECT TO AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION

00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:58.534
IT'S BROUGHT BY.

00:58:58.601 --> 00:59:02.138
MY OFFICE OR BY MY LOCAL

00:59:02.205 --> 00:59:05.608
COUNTERPARTS -- WITH THAT WOULD

00:59:05.675 --> 00:59:06.142
INCLUDE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF

00:59:06.209 --> 00:59:06.376
ACTION.

00:59:06.442 --> 00:59:07.043
THE IT'S NOT WITHIN THE TEXT OF

00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:08.945
THE STATUTE ITSELF BUT THERE IS

00:59:09.012 --> 00:59:10.446
A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WITHIN

00:59:10.513 --> 00:59:13.616
CCPA -- THAT DOESN'T REFERENCE

00:59:13.683 --> 00:59:14.751
ONE ONE STATUE THAT IS THE

00:59:14.817 --> 00:59:15.685
SUBJECT OF THE AMENDED

00:59:15.752 --> 00:59:17.553
LEGISLATION TODAY RIGHT SO I

00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:18.221
MEAN.

00:59:18.288 --> 00:59:19.989
JUST IF WE CAN GET DOWN TO THAT

00:59:20.056 --> 00:59:21.157
SO COULD SOMEONE BRING A PRIVATE

00:59:21.224 --> 00:59:23.326
RIGHT OF ACTION FOR A VIOLATION

00:59:23.393 --> 00:59:24.994
OF IF WE PASS THIS BILL INTO LAW

00:59:25.061 --> 00:59:26.129
COULD SOMEONE BRING A PRIVATE

00:59:26.195 --> 00:59:27.597
RIGHT OF ACTION FOR THIS KIND OF

00:59:27.664 --> 00:59:28.731
REACH.

00:59:28.798 --> 00:59:31.100
UNDERSEA CPA YES OKAY BUT IF

00:59:31.167 --> 00:59:32.168
THAT'S IT BUT BUT THERE'S A

00:59:32.235 --> 00:59:32.769
DIFFERENT THRESHOLD QUESTION

00:59:32.835 --> 00:59:33.970
THAT YOU WOULD IT'S NOT JUST A

00:59:34.037 --> 00:59:35.638
VIOLATION OF THE STATUTE THEY

00:59:35.705 --> 00:59:37.440
WOULD HAVE TO SHOW WITH THE CPA

00:59:37.507 --> 00:59:39.676
REQUIRES IN ORDER TO SUCCEED AND

00:59:39.742 --> 00:59:41.077
ON THAT WHEN I REASONABLE YOU

00:59:41.144 --> 00:59:42.211
DIDN'T HAVE REASONABLE PROTECT

00:59:42.278 --> 00:59:42.412
YOU.

00:59:42.478 --> 00:59:44.347
YOU CAN'T JUST SU AND THEN WHEN

00:59:44.414 --> 00:59:45.915
LIKE YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY PROVE

00:59:45.982 --> 00:59:47.250
THAT THEY DIDN'T PROTECT YOUR

00:59:47.317 --> 00:59:52.255
WRITING ON THIS AND I REALIZE

00:59:52.322 --> 00:59:53.990
THAT I'M MISSING.

00:59:54.057 --> 00:59:54.590
AT THAT REMEDY THAT OKAY FINAL

00:59:54.657 --> 00:59:55.625
QUESTION IS REALLY MORE FOR THE

00:59:55.692 --> 00:59:56.859
G. -- ONE THING THAT DOES

00:59:56.926 --> 00:59:57.560
CONCERN ME ABOUT SOME OF THIS IS

00:59:57.627 --> 00:59:59.395
WHAT WE'RE REQUIRE IN THIS OF

00:59:59.462 --> 01:00:00.897
BUSINESSES I THINK WE SHOULD.

01:00:00.964 --> 01:00:01.898
BUT YOU KNOW HAS A LOT OF

01:00:01.965 --> 01:00:03.933
GOVERNMENT ISSUED INFORMATION

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.669
AND BIOMETRIC DATA.

01:00:06.736 --> 01:00:07.737
THE GOVERNMENT.

01:00:07.804 --> 01:00:09.205
RIGHT.

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:12.775
SO WHEN THEY BLEAK DAY ARE

01:00:12.842 --> 01:00:13.476
SOMEHOW.

01:00:13.543 --> 01:00:16.245
NEO GET DATA OUT THERE ARE MAYBE.

01:00:16.312 --> 01:00:17.413
ACCIDENTALLY GIVE OUT PURCHASE

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.182
PRIVATE INFORMATION -- TWO

01:00:19.248 --> 01:00:20.316
GROUPS.

01:00:20.383 --> 01:00:22.151
SHOULD THE SAME RECOURSE BE

01:00:22.218 --> 01:00:24.220
THERE AGAINST GOVERNMENT. FOR

01:00:24.287 --> 01:00:25.722
THIS AS WELL AND I DON'T SEE

01:00:25.788 --> 01:00:27.357
THAT IN THIS BILL BUT MAYBE

01:00:27.423 --> 01:00:27.890
THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD

01:00:27.957 --> 01:00:29.158
CONSIDER I MEAN.

01:00:29.225 --> 01:00:31.060
I WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE GOOSE IS

01:00:31.127 --> 01:00:32.862
GOOD FOR THE GANDER AS THEY SAY

01:00:32.929 --> 01:00:33.730
RIGHT.

01:00:33.796 --> 01:00:35.465
I BELIEVE THAT THIS DOES ALSO

01:00:35.531 --> 01:00:37.734
REQUIRE THAT SECTION SEVENTEEN

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:38.468
NINETY EIGHT POINT TWENTY NINE

01:00:38.534 --> 01:00:40.937
BE AMENDED SO THAT DOES APPLY.

01:00:41.004 --> 01:00:42.038
TO WHEN IN THE I DON'T KNOW

01:00:42.105 --> 01:00:43.639
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO

01:00:43.706 --> 01:00:44.674
THERE BUT LIKE SO WHAT DO YOU

01:00:44.741 --> 01:00:49.012
MEAN BY THAT IT DOESN'T APPLY TO

01:00:49.078 --> 01:00:49.645
THE GOVERNMENT ARE AND SPEAKING

01:00:49.712 --> 01:00:52.548
IN CODE. FOR THAT REQUIRES THAT

01:00:52.615 --> 01:00:53.049
SEVENTY NINE TWENTY NINE

01:00:53.116 --> 01:00:53.616
SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT POINT

01:00:53.683 --> 01:00:55.284
pREQUIRES THAT WHEN A STATE

01:00:55.351 --> 01:00:57.253
AGENCY THAT HOLDS THE SAME DATA

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:58.287
POINTS.

01:00:58.354 --> 01:00:59.622
HAS SUFFERED A BREACH THAT THEY

01:00:59.689 --> 01:01:02.725
MAY MUST ALSO PROVIDE NOTICE.

01:01:02.792 --> 01:01:04.761
READ THAT SECTION ONE OF THE

01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:06.329
BILL SO WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT

01:01:06.396 --> 01:01:08.097
SECTION ONE OF THE BILL SO FAR

01:01:08.164 --> 01:01:09.432
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SECOND TO IN

01:01:09.499 --> 01:01:11.167
SECTION THIRTEEN BUT SO IS A

01:01:11.234 --> 01:01:13.236
STATE AGENCY THAT THAT DOES

01:01:13.302 --> 01:01:14.604
SUFFER A DATA BREACH.

01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:17.040
ALSO HAS THE SAME OBLIGATIONS.

01:01:17.106 --> 01:01:18.241
UNDER THE STATUTE TO PROVIDE

01:01:18.307 --> 01:01:19.909
NOTICE TO THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN

01:01:19.976 --> 01:01:21.611
AFFECTED BY THAT DATA BREACH

01:01:21.677 --> 01:01:24.113
OKAY AND IF THEY DEL.

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:26.516
THE CONSEQUENCE IS.

01:01:26.582 --> 01:01:28.785
SO THAT I AM IN THE DOJ BRING

01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:32.789
PENALTIES AGAINST ITSELF -- THAT

01:01:32.855 --> 01:01:33.923
IS AN INTERESTING QUESTION THAT

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:36.459
I'VE NOT BAD DID NOT PREPARE FOR

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:40.096
BUT I DON'T I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT

01:01:40.163 --> 01:01:41.497
SURE ABOUT THAT I NEED TO FILE A

01:01:41.564 --> 01:01:43.433
CLAIM THE GOVERNMENT JUST LIKE

01:01:43.499 --> 01:01:44.967
ANY OTHER.

01:01:45.034 --> 01:01:48.604
THING BEFORE RIGHT AND I HAVE A

01:01:48.671 --> 01:01:50.139
PROBLEM DAM LEAD INTO THAT.

01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:51.507
BUT I WOULD EXPECT THE ANYBODY'S

01:01:51.574 --> 01:01:54.010
BEEN PAID YET SO.

01:01:54.077 --> 01:01:54.877
BUT LOOK I MEAN I THINK THIS IS

01:01:54.944 --> 01:01:56.512
A LEGITIMATE ISSUE THAT WE NEED

01:01:56.579 --> 01:01:57.747
TO EXPLORE THE FUTURE IS LIKE A

01:01:57.814 --> 01:01:59.282
WERE REQUIRING THIS OF ALL THESE

01:01:59.348 --> 01:02:01.150
BUSINESSES BUT WE SHOULD REQUIRE

01:02:01.217 --> 01:02:02.285
THE SAME.

01:02:02.351 --> 01:02:03.152
OF GOVERNMENT AND THERE SHOULD

01:02:03.219 --> 01:02:04.587
BE REAL PENALTIES AND

01:02:04.654 --> 01:02:07.156
CONSEQUENCES IN THE EVENT THE

01:02:07.223 --> 01:02:07.623
GOVERNMENT.

01:02:07.690 --> 01:02:08.958
PREACHES THIS INFORMATION AS

01:02:09.025 --> 01:02:10.793
WELL AS JUST IS JUST AS MUCH OF

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:12.028
A RISK.

01:02:12.095 --> 01:02:13.596
MAYBE MAYBE IN SOME CASES

01:02:13.663 --> 01:02:15.932
GREATER.

01:02:15.998 --> 01:02:18.234
I'M WRITING IT DOWN THINKING.

01:02:18.301 --> 01:02:20.069
ON IT'S GOOD OF MISTER OBERNOLTE

01:02:20.136 --> 01:02:21.304
AND ENOUGH FOLLOWED BY MISS

01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:23.039
WICKS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF

01:02:23.106 --> 01:02:25.374
MR LEVINE MINE ANALYSIS HAS A

01:02:25.441 --> 01:02:27.076
OPPOSE A RECOMMENDATION ON THIS

01:02:27.143 --> 01:02:28.878
I DISAGREE I THINK YOU'VE RAISED

01:02:28.945 --> 01:02:30.113
AN IMPORTANT POINT.

01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:31.347
AND THE POINT A TO RAISING IS

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:32.348
THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN

01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:33.850
CLASSIFICATIONS OF DATA THAT

01:02:33.916 --> 01:02:36.252
HAVE UNIQUE POTENTIAL TO BE USED

01:02:36.319 --> 01:02:37.487
FOR IDENTITY THEFT AND THOSE

01:02:37.553 --> 01:02:39.555
DESERVE TO BE HELD. TO A HIGHER

01:02:39.622 --> 01:02:41.591
STANDARD PROTECTION THAN OTHER

01:02:41.657 --> 01:02:42.758
KINDS OF DATA AND I I TOOK

01:02:42.825 --> 01:02:43.759
COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU ON

01:02:43.826 --> 01:02:45.361
THAT AND SO I THINK THIS IS A

01:02:45.428 --> 01:02:46.529
BILL THAT I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:48.297
SUPPORT BUT I'M ALSO SYMPATHETIC.

01:02:48.364 --> 01:02:49.298
TO SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE

01:02:49.365 --> 01:02:51.000
BEEN RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION AT

01:02:51.067 --> 01:02:52.335
IN PARTICULAR.

01:02:52.401 --> 01:02:55.905
THE ISSUE THAT -- THE BILL IS SO

01:02:55.972 --> 01:02:57.406
BROAD THAT IT INCLUDES A LOT OF

01:02:57.473 --> 01:02:58.674
DATA THAT DOESN'T FALL INTO THAT

01:02:58.741 --> 01:02:59.842
CATEGORY.

01:02:59.909 --> 01:03:01.744
AND IN PARTICULARLY PARTICULAR

01:03:01.811 --> 01:03:03.379
AYE AYE I THINK WE NEED TO WORK

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:05.681
ON THE DEFINITION OF BIOMETRIC

01:03:05.748 --> 01:03:07.383
DATA BECAUSE FROM A TECHNICAL

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:09.051
STANDPOINT BY MATTER DATE AS

01:03:09.118 --> 01:03:11.287
ANYTHING THAT I COLLECT.

01:03:11.354 --> 01:03:13.055
YEAH IN AN AUTOMATED WAY.

01:03:13.122 --> 01:03:14.190
FROM A HUMAN USER SO OFTEN FOR

01:03:14.257 --> 01:03:15.858
EXAMPLE MY WATCH KNOWS WHAT MY

01:03:15.925 --> 01:03:18.027
RESTING HEART RATE WAS AND HOW

01:03:18.094 --> 01:03:19.829
FAST MY FASTEST MILE WAS THIS

01:03:19.896 --> 01:03:20.730
WEEK.

01:03:20.796 --> 01:03:23.266
WHICH WAS NOT VERY FAST AMEND

01:03:23.332 --> 01:03:23.733
THE SUSPENSE.

01:03:23.799 --> 01:03:24.800
BUT I MEAN THAT DATA IS NOT

01:03:24.867 --> 01:03:26.702
USEFUL TO SOMEBODY WHO'S TRYING

01:03:26.769 --> 01:03:28.304
TO STEAL MY IDENTIFICATION.

01:03:28.371 --> 01:03:28.604
IN.

01:03:28.671 --> 01:03:30.206
A SIMILARLY GOVERNMENT ISSUED ID

01:03:30.273 --> 01:03:32.575
IS -- AS THE OPPOSITION HAS

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:33.376
RAISED.

01:03:33.442 --> 01:03:34.610
A PASSPORT A NUMBER WAS

01:03:34.677 --> 01:03:36.145
CERTAINLY NOT BE SOMETHING THAT

01:03:36.212 --> 01:03:37.813
I WOULD WANT IN THE HANDS OF

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:39.348
SOMEONE ELSE.

01:03:39.415 --> 01:03:40.716
HOWEVER A FISHING LICENSE NUMBER

01:03:40.783 --> 01:03:42.018
YOU KNOW IF I TRY TO OPEN A BANK

01:03:42.084 --> 01:03:43.586
ACCOUNT WITHOUT YOU KNOW REALLY

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:45.755
NOT SO MUCH THAT'S THAT'S NOT IS

01:03:45.821 --> 01:03:47.924
IT IS DAMAGING SO -- I'M I GUESS

01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:49.158
I'M ASKING WHAT IS YOUR

01:03:49.225 --> 01:03:50.193
COMMITMENT LEVEL TO WORKING ON

01:03:50.259 --> 01:03:51.694
THOSE ISSUES BECAUSE I REALLY

01:03:51.761 --> 01:03:53.029
WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT THE BILL

01:03:53.095 --> 01:03:56.399
YEAH I'LL REPEAT THE THE

01:03:56.465 --> 01:03:57.633
METAPHOR I USED EARLIER LIKE

01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:59.735
WE'VE LITERALLY ALMOST HIGH

01:03:59.802 --> 01:04:01.370
FIVES ON AMENDMENTS AND WE'RE

01:04:01.437 --> 01:04:02.505
GOING TO GO BACK.

01:04:02.572 --> 01:04:03.906
FOR A SECOND ROUND OF TRYING TO

01:04:03.973 --> 01:04:05.441
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO GET

01:04:05.508 --> 01:04:07.877
THE DEFINITIONS IN PLACE THAT --

01:04:07.944 --> 01:04:08.477
I THINK WE'LL.

01:04:08.544 --> 01:04:11.280
DIED DEAL WITH THE OPPOSITIONS

01:04:11.347 --> 01:04:12.248
CONCERNS I THINK THAT YOU KNOW

01:04:12.315 --> 01:04:13.249
THEY'VE BEEN AT THE TABLE EVERY

01:04:13.316 --> 01:04:15.251
STEP OF THE WAY I FEEL -- I'M

01:04:15.318 --> 01:04:21.057
ALSO GRATEFUL NOT JUST FOR THEIR

01:04:21.123 --> 01:04:22.058
LEVEL OF INTERACTION BUT ALSO

01:04:22.124 --> 01:04:22.858
FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S STAFF

01:04:22.925 --> 01:04:24.594
AS WELL -- THERE IS A LOT OF

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:26.963
STAFF TIME -- TO MATCH THE

01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:28.798
CHAMBERS INTEREST AS WELL TO

01:04:28.864 --> 01:04:30.866
MAKE SURE THAT WE GET IT RIGHT.

01:04:30.933 --> 01:04:31.434
AND AND SO MY COMMITMENT IS

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:34.804
THERE.

01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:35.905
OKAY WELL THANK YOU WITH THAT

01:04:35.972 --> 01:04:36.839
I'M GONNA MAKE SURE YOU THAT WE

01:04:36.906 --> 01:04:38.407
ARE ALSO WORKING VERY HARD ON

01:04:38.474 --> 01:04:41.744
THIS AND WE AND WE'RE I THINK

01:04:41.811 --> 01:04:42.678
IT'S SAFE TO SAY WE'RE NOT

01:04:42.745 --> 01:04:44.313
INTERESTED IN HUNTING LICENCES A

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:45.715
FISHING LICENSE AND THAT KIND OF

01:04:45.781 --> 01:04:46.349
THING EITHER BECAUSE DEFINITELY

01:04:46.415 --> 01:04:47.583
NOT YOUR LIBRARY DON'T.

01:04:47.650 --> 01:04:49.085
SEE THEM AS IDENTIFICATION

01:04:49.151 --> 01:04:50.553
DOCUMENTS AND THAT'S REALLY THE

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:52.888
CRUX OF THE MATTER HERE SO WE'RE

01:04:52.955 --> 01:04:53.889
TRYING REAL HARD THIS.

01:04:53.956 --> 01:04:55.324
IN A SWEET SPOT THAT LANGUAGE IT

01:04:55.391 --> 01:04:56.959
GETS IDENTIFICATION DOCUMENTS

01:04:57.026 --> 01:05:01.330
AND NOT DOCUMENTS THAT PEOPLE

01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:03.165
DON'T USE PRESIDENTE MAKING.

01:05:03.232 --> 01:05:05.234
ALL RIGHT WELL SO WITH A

01:05:05.301 --> 01:05:07.003
COMMITMENT -- WHAT WE'RE GONNA

01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:07.870
SEE THIS AGAIN APPROPRIATIONS OF

01:05:07.937 --> 01:05:09.071
NOT BEFORE SO -- ALLSTATE TODAY

01:05:09.138 --> 01:05:09.739
AND HOPE THAT YOU GET TO A PLACE

01:05:09.805 --> 01:05:11.474
WHERE WHERE WE CAN ALL AGREE

01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:12.708
THAT IT'S IN ON A PRO

AROUND OR WANTED TO REQUEST

01:05:28.491 --> 01:05:30.159
AMENDMENTS ARE ON THE BIOMETRIC

01:05:30.226 --> 01:05:30.793
DATA AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE

01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:31.861
SURE.

EVERYONE'S GOT A SEAT AT THE

01:05:36.799 --> 01:05:38.134
TABLE IT'S FASCINATING BECAUSE

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.635
YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT CONCERNS FROM

01:05:39.702 --> 01:05:40.603
THE CHAMBER THAT WANT A

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:41.837
NARROWING AND THEN THE WE HAVE

01:05:41.904 --> 01:05:43.739
CONCERNS FROM OTHER STAKEHOLDERS

01:05:43.806 --> 01:05:45.708
THAT WANT A BROADENING.

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:48.077
AND SO IT'S YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING

01:05:48.144 --> 01:05:49.378

THAT WE'RE ABLE TO ADDRESS THESE

01:05:53.215 --> 01:05:54.216
THINGS TO KEEP CALIFORNIANS SAFE.

01:05:54.283 --> 01:05:54.884
AND TAKE ALL OF THAT INPUT TO TO

01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:59.088
GET TO THAT POINT.

01:05:59.155 --> 01:06:00.756
MS FUNK AHEAD.

01:06:00.823 --> 01:06:02.525
I JUST A QUICK QUESTION -- I AND

01:06:02.591 --> 01:06:03.225
I KNOW TO THIS THE SECOND

01:06:03.292 --> 01:06:04.660
INDIVIDUAL THE TESTIFIED IN

01:06:04.727 --> 01:06:06.462
OPPOSITION -- INDICATED SOME

01:06:06.529 --> 01:06:07.763
EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FROM ILLINOIS

01:06:07.830 --> 01:06:09.465
WHERE THERE WAS A RISE IN A AND

01:06:09.532 --> 01:06:11.567
LAWSUITS A BASED ON A LOT THEY

01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:13.969
PASS I WAS WONDERING HOW SIMILAR

01:06:14.036 --> 01:06:16.972
IS THIS -- BILL TO WHAT EXISTS

01:06:17.039 --> 01:06:18.674
IN ILLINOIS AND MAYBE THE

01:06:18.741 --> 01:06:19.575
GENERAL CAN COME BACK UP AND

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:21.243
KIND OF SHED SOME LIGHT IN TERMS

01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:24.647
OF THE ILLINOIS EXPERIENCE.

01:06:24.714 --> 01:06:27.750
I APOLOGIZE FOR BRING BACK UP.

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:28.417
TO MY UNDERSTANDING THE ILLINOIS

01:06:28.484 --> 01:06:29.452
LAW IS DIFFERENT IN THE SENSE

01:06:29.518 --> 01:06:32.288
THAT IT REQUIRES -- BUSINESSES

01:06:32.355 --> 01:06:35.224
TO DISCLOSE AND OBTAIN CONSENT

01:06:35.291 --> 01:06:36.926
OF INDIVIDUALS TO OBTAIN

01:06:36.992 --> 01:06:38.961
BIOMETRIC DATA AND USE BIOMETRIC

01:06:39.028 --> 01:06:40.229
DATA.

01:06:40.296 --> 01:06:40.830
THIS IS JUST THE DATA BREACH

01:06:40.896 --> 01:06:42.865
NOTIFICATION LAW HOWEVER WE HAVE

01:06:42.932 --> 01:06:45.935
SEEN LAWSUITS -- IN ILLINOIS

01:06:46.001 --> 01:06:47.269
ALLEGING THAT THE MERE.

01:06:47.336 --> 01:06:48.604
EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION BETWEEN

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:50.306
AN EMPLOYER AND A THIRD PARTY

01:06:50.373 --> 01:06:51.507
SUCH AS THE USE OF A BIOMETRIC

01:06:51.574 --> 01:06:52.608
TIME CLOCKS.

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:53.509
SHARING THAT INFORMATION WITH

01:06:53.576 --> 01:06:55.010
THE PAYROLL COMPANY IN PROCESS

01:06:55.077 --> 01:06:57.713
PAYROLL CONSIDERED AN AUTHORIZED

01:06:57.780 --> 01:06:58.647
BREACH.

01:06:58.714 --> 01:07:00.182
OKAY NOT A CONCERT AND ARE THERE

01:07:00.249 --> 01:07:04.153
SIMILARITIES THE BILL IN

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:05.755
QUESTION TO THE ILLINOIS LAW.

01:07:05.821 --> 01:07:07.656
SO JUST TO BE CLEAR -- THE

01:07:07.723 --> 01:07:10.192
ILLINOIS LAW AS I'M SORRY I

01:07:10.259 --> 01:07:12.027
DON'T KNOW.

01:07:12.094 --> 01:07:13.496
HAD HAD HAD JUST NOTED THAT THE

01:07:13.562 --> 01:07:14.130
DEFINITE THE ILLINOIS COURT --

01:07:14.196 --> 01:07:16.298
FOUND THAT THERE WAS A PRIVATE

01:07:16.365 --> 01:07:17.266
RIGHT OF ACTION IN THAT CASE AS

01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:19.668
WELL AND THERE WAS -- IT WAS UP

01:07:19.735 --> 01:07:20.536
HELL TO THE PRIVATE ACTION WAS

01:07:20.603 --> 01:07:22.471
UPHELD BECAUSE THE COURT FOUND

01:07:22.538 --> 01:07:23.973
THAT THE VIOLATION OF THE

01:07:24.039 --> 01:07:25.074
STATUTE OF THE PRIVACY INTERESTS

01:07:25.141 --> 01:07:27.076
WAS SO SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE THERE

01:07:27.143 --> 01:07:29.578
WAS NOT NOTICED BEFORE -- THE

01:07:29.645 --> 01:07:31.647
BIOMETRIC DATA WAS TAKEN AND SO

01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:33.182
THE THE STATUTE THERE IS

01:07:33.249 --> 01:07:34.517
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAT IS THAT

01:07:34.583 --> 01:07:37.219
IS A STATUTE THAT IS PROTECTING --

01:07:37.286 --> 01:07:38.988
THE RIGHT OF THE INDIVIDUAL TO

01:07:39.054 --> 01:07:42.024
BE NOTIFIED BEFORE BIOMETRIC

01:07:42.091 --> 01:07:43.459
DATA IS IS.

01:07:43.526 --> 01:07:44.794
IS USED IN THIS CASE IT WAS LIKE

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:45.961
A A MINOR WAS ATTENDING AN

01:07:46.028 --> 01:07:47.897
AMUSEMENT PARK AND THAT A SCAN

01:07:47.963 --> 01:07:49.198
OF THEIR I THINK IT WAS THERE

01:07:49.265 --> 01:07:50.032
THAT THEIR FACE OR THEIR

01:07:50.099 --> 01:07:51.500
FINGERPRINT WAS TAKEN.

01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:53.235
IN ORDER TO GAIN ENTRY AND SO

01:07:53.302 --> 01:07:55.070
THERE WAS NO NOTICE TO THE TO

01:07:55.137 --> 01:07:58.374
THE PARENTS UP TO THE MINOR'S

01:07:58.441 --> 01:08:02.344
PARENT -- BUT IMPORTANTLY THERE

01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:03.546
THE THE REQUIREMENT IN THE

01:08:03.612 --> 01:08:05.080
ILLINOIS A LOT WAS THAT BEFORE

01:08:05.147 --> 01:08:07.082
BIOMETRIC DATA IS TAKEN BUT IT

01:08:07.149 --> 01:08:08.484
IN ADDITION TO THE CONSENT

01:08:08.551 --> 01:08:09.452
PROVISION.

01:08:09.518 --> 01:08:10.886
THEIR REQUIREMENT IS ALSO THAT

01:08:10.953 --> 01:08:11.787
THE BIOMETRIC DATA IS

01:08:11.854 --> 01:08:13.489
SAFEGUARDED AND SO THAT IS

01:08:13.556 --> 01:08:15.124
SIMILAR TO SEVENTEEN NINETY

01:08:15.191 --> 01:08:16.025
EIGHT POINT EIGHT ONE POINT FIVE

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:17.259
WHICH REQUIRES REASONABLE

01:08:17.326 --> 01:08:18.561
SAFEGUARDS HERE.

01:08:18.627 --> 01:08:20.329
SO I THINK THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT

01:08:20.396 --> 01:08:21.530
TO UNDERSCORE AS WELL AND THAT

01:08:21.597 --> 01:08:22.731
WAS UP HELD BY THE ILLINOIS

01:08:22.798 --> 01:08:25.367
SUPREME COURT AS IN IN TERMS OF

01:08:25.434 --> 01:08:29.171
THE THE THE LOBBYING PRESERVED.

01:08:29.238 --> 01:08:30.639
SURE COMMENT ON THAT JUST VERY

01:08:30.706 --> 01:08:32.441
BRIEFLY -- I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON

01:08:32.508 --> 01:08:34.143
THE ILLINOIS LOT ALL I JUST MY

01:08:34.210 --> 01:08:35.978
UNDERSTANDING IS IT DID INCLUDE

01:08:36.045 --> 01:08:37.480
OR DOES INCLUDE PHOTOGRAPHS.

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:39.048
AND THAT IS A CONCERN OF OURS

01:08:39.114 --> 01:08:40.649
THAT THAT WOULD BE WAY TOO BROAD

01:08:40.716 --> 01:08:41.217
BECAUSE THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:42.151
YOU'RE BRINGING IN.

01:08:42.218 --> 01:08:43.452
CONTENT ON THE WEB SECURITY

01:08:43.519 --> 01:08:45.654
CAMERAS LIKE EVERYTHING THAT HAS

01:08:45.721 --> 01:08:46.689
A PICTURE OF A PERSON NOW IS

01:08:46.755 --> 01:08:48.424
BIOMETRIC DATA AND WE'RE JUST

01:08:48.491 --> 01:08:49.458
WORRIED THAT'S ESPECIALLY WHEN

01:08:49.525 --> 01:08:49.959
YOU'RE.

01:08:50.025 --> 01:08:51.460
TALKING ABOUT ADDING NOT ONLY

01:08:51.527 --> 01:08:52.361
REDUCE WHAT REGIONAL SECURITY

01:08:52.428 --> 01:08:53.963
BUT THEN THE VERY SIGNIFICANT

01:08:54.029 --> 01:08:55.664
STATUTORY DAMAGES NO PROOF OF

01:08:55.731 --> 01:08:57.600
INJURY LIABILITY WITH THE C. C.

01:08:57.666 --> 01:08:59.735
PA THAT IS TIED TO THAT SECTION.

01:08:59.802 --> 01:09:00.402
BUT IT'S JUST YOU'RE GONNA BE OR

01:09:00.469 --> 01:09:01.871
WHAT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE

01:09:01.937 --> 01:09:02.838
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU INCLUDED

01:09:02.905 --> 01:09:03.906
PHOTOGRAPHS BUT I THINK IT

01:09:03.973 --> 01:09:05.541
INCLUDED FEAST GEOMETRY THAT WAS

01:09:05.608 --> 01:09:07.076
GLEANED FROM THE PHOTOGRAPH SO

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:10.513
IT'S NOT THE ACTUAL PHOTOGRAPH

01:09:10.579 --> 01:09:11.647
ITSELF IT'S NOT LIKE THE THE

01:09:11.714 --> 01:09:12.515
PICTURE IT'S WHAT THE TECHNOLOGY.

01:09:12.581 --> 01:09:14.283
DOES WHEN IT'S PROCESSING THE

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:16.552
THE THE FACIAL GEOMETRY OF THE

01:09:16.619 --> 01:09:17.653
INDIVIDUAL AND I THINK THAT

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:19.288
THAT'S ACTUALLY RIGHT BEFORE THE

01:09:19.355 --> 01:09:21.690
NINTH CIRCUIT RIGHT NOW --

01:09:21.757 --> 01:09:23.425
INVOLVING A CAN OF AT THAT THAT

01:09:23.492 --> 01:09:24.827
QUESTION I I DID MINISTER OF A

01:09:24.894 --> 01:09:26.495
BACK AND FORTH BUT BUT I DO

01:09:26.562 --> 01:09:27.563
APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT NO NO

01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:28.531
AND I AND AT THAT THE THE

01:09:28.597 --> 01:09:30.599
INFORMATION IS VERY IMPORTANT.

01:09:30.666 --> 01:09:31.567
I THINK MY BROADER POINT IS THAT

01:09:31.634 --> 01:09:33.936
SINCE OTHER STATES HAVE

01:09:34.003 --> 01:09:35.404
UNDERTAKEN SIMILAR EFFORTS THAT

01:09:35.471 --> 01:09:37.306
WE TAKE THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE

01:09:37.373 --> 01:09:38.440
THAT EXISTS AND WHAT HAS

01:09:38.507 --> 01:09:39.842
TRANSPIRED POSTS.

01:09:39.909 --> 01:09:40.876
AB IMITATION OF A NUMBER THESE

01:09:40.943 --> 01:09:42.478
LAWS SO THAT WE DON'T MAKE THE

01:09:42.545 --> 01:09:45.114
SAME MISTAKES -- OR CAUSE ANY

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:48.851
UNNECESSARY LITIGATION OR OR OR

01:09:48.918 --> 01:09:50.953
HARM. TO THE TO THE ONLY THE

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:51.787
BUSINESS COMMITTEE BUT TO THE

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:52.721
CONSUMERS AT LARGE SO I

01:09:52.788 --> 01:09:54.423
APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION THERE

01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:57.026
ARE TWELVE STATES AB TWELVE OR

01:09:57.092 --> 01:09:57.760
I'M SORRY.

01:09:57.826 --> 01:09:58.427
YOUR TWELVE STATES THAT

01:09:58.494 --> 01:10:00.129
CURRENTLY COVER BIOMETRIC DATA

01:10:00.195 --> 01:10:02.464
IN THEIR BREACH NOTIFICATION

01:10:02.531 --> 01:10:03.866
LAWS AND WITH THAT. EIGHT IN

01:10:03.933 --> 01:10:04.800
TERMS OF THE TWELVE STATES DO WE

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:06.802
MODEL THIS BILL AFTER SPECIFIC

01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:07.903
STATES ARE WE TAKE PICK AND

01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:09.138
CHOOSE THE THE PROVISIONS WITHIN

01:10:09.204 --> 01:10:10.873
THE STATE WE DID WE TRY TO

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:12.308
HARMONIZE THE DEFINITION WITH

01:10:12.374 --> 01:10:13.709
THOSE OTHER STATE THERE ARE SOME

01:10:13.776 --> 01:10:15.077
STATES THAT DON'T EVEN DEFINED

01:10:15.144 --> 01:10:16.612
BIOMETRIC DATA AND THEIR STATUTE.

01:10:16.679 --> 01:10:18.347
THEY JUST SIMPLY SAY BIOMETRIC

01:10:18.414 --> 01:10:20.683
DATA AND SO WE CHOSE TO USE A

01:10:20.749 --> 01:10:22.084
LITTLE BIT MORE LANGUAGE FOR

01:10:22.151 --> 01:10:24.086
PURPOSES OF OF CLARITY BUT YOU

01:10:24.153 --> 01:10:25.754
KNOW WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK

01:10:25.821 --> 01:10:27.590
SURE AND AS AS THIS DEVELOP SOME

01:10:27.656 --> 01:10:28.891
I'M SURE WE'LL GET MORE.

01:10:28.958 --> 01:10:30.659
AT WILL GET MORE SPECIFICS AS IT

01:10:30.726 --> 01:10:36.298
AS IT INVOLVES BUT I PROJECT

01:10:36.365 --> 01:10:38.867
INFORMATION THANK YOU.

01:10:38.934 --> 01:10:39.735
I SEE NO OTHER MISTER I WENT

01:10:39.802 --> 01:10:42.638
AHEAD -- YES TODAY I AM GOING TO

01:10:42.705 --> 01:10:43.472
BE OF STANDING ON YOUR BILL AYE

01:10:43.539 --> 01:10:44.506
I KNOW IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT

01:10:44.573 --> 01:10:45.941
WE PROTECT BIOMETRIC AND AND

01:10:46.008 --> 01:10:47.209
INFORMATION LIKE PASSPORT

01:10:47.276 --> 01:10:48.143
NUMBERS.

01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:49.912
BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE HAVING

01:10:49.979 --> 01:10:51.847
EFFORTS TO EXPAND THE PRIVATE

01:10:51.914 --> 01:10:53.215
RIGHT OF ACTION IN THE C. C. P.

01:10:53.282 --> 01:10:55.618
A PA AND I WANT TO BE VERY

01:10:55.684 --> 01:10:56.785
CAREFUL TO NOT.

01:10:56.852 --> 01:10:59.788
UNDO THE COMPROMISE THAT WE MADE

01:10:59.855 --> 01:11:00.723
LAST YEAR.

01:11:00.789 --> 01:11:02.491
AND BE REALLY DELIVERED ABOUT

01:11:02.558 --> 01:11:03.926
WHAT'S GONNA BE SUBJECT TO THE

01:11:03.993 --> 01:11:08.397
P. R. A. -- WITHIN CCPA AND I

01:11:08.464 --> 01:11:09.632
JUST DON'T THINK THAT ALL BY

01:11:09.698 --> 01:11:11.133
MEAN AYE I REALLY THINK A LOT OF

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:13.202
THESE DEFINITIONS HAVE TO BE --

01:11:13.268 --> 01:11:15.638
TIGHTENED UP AND I HOPE THAT.

AND ONE OF WHICH IS THE ARE --

01:12:31.413 --> 01:12:32.848

NOT ONLY CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO

01:12:49.131 --> 01:12:50.332
ACROSS THE NATION AND SO IT'S

BOB THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTER

01:25:16.077 --> 01:25:16.978
NINETEEN EIGHTIES WHAT WE SEE

01:25:17.045 --> 01:25:18.913
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS

01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:19.514
THAT ALTHOUGH THERE IS FROM

01:25:19.581 --> 01:25:20.548

OF JOBS THAT ARE DISPLACED SO.

01:25:29.624 --> 01:25:30.191

FACE THAT STARK REALITY IT'S

01:25:31.726 --> 01:25:33.828
IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE

01:25:33.895 --> 01:25:35.396

01:25:35.463 --> 01:25:36.664

PURPOSE OF THE BILL.

01:25:41.503 --> 01:25:42.904

THE STANDPOINT OF WORKERS IT'S

01:25:58.419 --> 01:25:59.187
MUCH BETTER TO HAVE THIS

MILLION JOBS ANNUALLY.

01:31:14.402 --> 01:31:16.437
A CONVERSATION EARLIER -- ON A

01:31:16.504 --> 01:31:19.240
PREVIOUS BILL -- I THINK IS --

01:31:19.307 --> 01:31:20.241
SET A RELEVANT TO WHAT WE'RE

01:31:20.308 --> 01:31:23.845
DOING HERE -- THE CCPA WHICH HAS

01:31:23.911 --> 01:31:25.847
IS TO YOU KNOW INCREDIBLY

01:31:25.913 --> 01:31:27.615
AMBITIOUS PIECE OF LEGISLATION

01:31:27.682 --> 01:31:29.150
WE'VE ALSO DISCUSSED A AND

01:31:29.217 --> 01:31:31.152
NUMBER OF NUMBER FOLKS HERE --

01:31:31.219 --> 01:31:32.620
ON THE ON THE DAY US ARE ALSO

01:31:32.687 --> 01:31:35.656

01:31:40.728 --> 01:31:42.463
THIS BILL WOULD.

01:31:42.530 --> 01:31:44.165
AT THE CITY WOULD CREATE A I

01:31:44.232 --> 01:31:45.299
THINK AT THE SAME TIME AS WE'RE

01:31:45.366 --> 01:31:46.868
WORKING ON ALL THE OTHER CCPA

01:31:46.934 --> 01:31:48.369
STUFF.

01:31:48.436 --> 01:31:50.004
CERTAINLY ANOTHER LEVEL OF I

01:31:50.071 --> 01:31:52.139
THINK COMPLICATION THAT WE WOULD

01:31:52.206 --> 01:31:53.341
SUGGEST.

01:31:53.407 --> 01:31:55.509
PERHAPS WAIT UNTIL WOULD GO

01:31:55.576 --> 01:31:57.612
THROUGH ALL THE C. C. P. A.

01:31:57.678 --> 01:31:59.113
RELATED RELATED THINGS.

01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:00.348
WE BELIEVE THAT BEFORE AN ACTING

01:32:00.414 --> 01:32:02.116
ADDITIONAL PRIVACY REGULATIONS

01:32:02.183 --> 01:32:03.618
THAT TIME FIRST BE GIVEN TO THE

01:32:03.684 --> 01:32:05.920
AG IS IN THE PROCESS OF ISSUING

01:32:05.987 --> 01:32:08.589
REGULATIONS -- THEY'VE HAD FIVE

01:32:08.656 --> 01:32:11.893
PUBLIC FORUMS FOR FIVE OR SIX

01:32:11.959 --> 01:32:13.427
THE REGULATIONS ARE DUE OUT IN

01:32:13.494 --> 01:32:14.695
THE FALL.

01:32:14.762 --> 01:32:15.696
BUT WE HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF

01:32:15.763 --> 01:32:18.132
OTHER LEGISLATION -- RELATED TO

01:32:18.199 --> 01:32:19.533
THE C. CPA.

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:22.737
THAT IS STILL BEING DEALT WITH --

01:32:22.803 --> 01:32:24.138
AND IT'S BEEN DESCRIBED THAT

01:32:24.205 --> 01:32:26.240
HAVE THE REGULATIONS ON GOING AT

01:32:26.307 --> 01:32:27.308
THE SAME TIME WE'RE DEALING WITH

01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:28.542
C. C. P. A. ISSUES.

01:32:28.609 --> 01:32:30.044
IS SORT OF LIKE PLAYING THREE

01:32:30.111 --> 01:32:32.213
DIMENSIONAL CHESS AND IT'S

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:34.615
REALLY TRUE -- TWELVE OH TWO A.

01:32:34.682 --> 01:32:35.516
B. TWELVE A TWO WE THINK WILL

01:32:35.583 --> 01:32:36.784
WILL ADD TO THAT LEVEL OF

01:32:36.851 --> 01:32:38.653
COMPLICATION WE CERTAINLY

01:32:38.719 --> 01:32:40.488
UNDERSTAND -- OF WHAT YOU'RE

01:32:40.554 --> 01:32:43.157
TRYING TO GET AFTER I THINK WE

01:32:43.224 --> 01:32:46.060
WE WOULD ASK THAT MAYBE WE SLOW

01:32:46.127 --> 01:32:48.562
THINGS DOWN AND ALLOW. ONE THING

01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:50.865
AT A TIME TO HAPPEN AS WE TRY TO

01:32:50.932 --> 01:32:51.499
PUT ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS

01:32:51.565 --> 01:32:53.200
TOGETHER -- THE REGISTRATION

01:32:53.267 --> 01:32:54.769
REQUIREMENT WE DOES DOES NOT

01:32:54.835 --> 01:32:56.137
BELIEVE PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH

01:32:56.203 --> 01:32:57.805
NEWER HELPFUL INFORMATION AND

01:32:57.872 --> 01:32:59.440
COULD RESULT IN SOME CONSUMER

01:32:59.507 --> 01:33:00.708
CONFUSIONS.

01:33:00.775 --> 01:33:02.677
WE WOULD ALSO SUGGEST THAT IF

01:33:02.743 --> 01:33:04.011
WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH OPT OUT

01:33:04.078 --> 01:33:05.579
PROVISIONS OF SOME OF THE OTHER

01:33:05.646 --> 01:33:07.248
ASPECTS THAT IT BE DONE IN IN

01:33:07.315 --> 01:33:09.517
THE CONTEXT OF CALIFORNIA

01:33:09.583 --> 01:33:11.519
CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT.

01:33:11.585 --> 01:33:12.320
NOT A SEPARATE.

01:33:12.386 --> 01:33:14.989
BILL -- GIVEN THE RECENT PASSAGE

01:33:15.056 --> 01:33:16.290
OF CC GIVE BE A WHICH WILL

01:33:16.357 --> 01:33:18.259
CREATE STILL UNFORESEEN CHANGES

01:33:18.326 --> 01:33:19.860
TO THE DIGITAL ECONOMY.

01:33:19.927 --> 01:33:20.861
AND WHICH IS CURRENTLY BEING

01:33:20.928 --> 01:33:22.630
UPDATED THROUGH RULE MAKING IT'S

01:33:22.697 --> 01:33:23.731
IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT ANY

01:33:23.798 --> 01:33:24.799
ADDITIONAL CHANGES TO THE

01:33:24.865 --> 01:33:26.367
STATE'S INFORMATION PRIVACY LAWS

01:33:26.434 --> 01:33:28.369
ARE CAREFULLY CRAFTED. TO WORK

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:30.838
WITH AND INTEROPERABLE SCHEME.

01:33:30.905 --> 01:33:33.007
OF FOR THOSE REASONS -- WE WOULD

01:33:33.074 --> 01:33:34.842
ASK THAT MAYBE SLOW THINGS DOWN

01:33:34.909 --> 01:33:36.544
KINDA LOOK AT ALL THIS IT'S SORT

01:33:36.610 --> 01:33:38.245
OF COMPREHENSIVELY WITHIN THE CC

01:33:38.312 --> 01:33:40.848
PA -- AND IF WE FEEL THAT THIS

01:33:40.915 --> 01:33:41.749
IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:33:41.816 --> 01:33:43.617
DONE -- THAT MAYBE WE CAN LOOK

01:33:43.684 --> 01:33:45.386
AT IT LATER BUT RIGHT NOW WE

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:47.588
WOULD -- WE WOULD ASK THAT --

01:33:47.655 --> 01:33:50.925
THE UNFORTUNATELY HAVE TO STAY

01:33:50.992 --> 01:33:52.226

DISCUSSIONS WITH WITH YOUR

01:34:09.977 --> 01:34:11.078
OFFICE BUT OUR CONCERNS

01:34:11.145 --> 01:34:12.546
UNFORTUNATELY WERE ABLE TO GET

01:34:12.613 --> 01:34:13.214
OUR POSITION.

01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:14.815
LINED UP BY THE LETTER DEADLINES

01:34:14.882 --> 01:34:17.051
WE APOLOGIZE FOR THAT -- WE ALSO

01:34:17.118 --> 01:34:18.819
I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT -- IN

01:34:18.886 --> 01:34:20.087
THE INTENT LANGUAGE OF THE BILL

01:34:20.154 --> 01:34:21.555
THE AUTHOR CALLS OUT THE MANY

01:34:21.622 --> 01:34:22.890
POSITIVE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT DATA

01:34:22.957 --> 01:34:24.492
BROKERS MAKE TO OUR MODERN

01:34:24.558 --> 01:34:26.260
ECONOMY AND TO ENABLE CRUCIAL

01:34:26.327 --> 01:34:27.261
GOVERNMENT SERVICES TO MOVE

01:34:27.328 --> 01:34:27.795
FORWARD.

01:34:27.862 --> 01:34:29.196
AND SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT

01:34:29.263 --> 01:34:31.766
A LOT -- JUST OUR MAIN CONCERNS

01:34:31.832 --> 01:34:34.769
ARE THAT -- THE BILL I HAVE

01:34:34.835 --> 01:34:35.503
REFERENCES SOME OF THE BROAD

01:34:35.569 --> 01:34:36.670
DEFINITIONS IN THE C. C. K.

01:34:36.737 --> 01:34:38.139
WHICH COULD LEAD TO WERE

01:34:38.205 --> 01:34:39.907
CONCERNED -- MORE BUSINESSES

01:34:39.974 --> 01:34:41.075
REGISTERING IS DATA BROKERS AND

01:34:41.142 --> 01:34:42.610
ACTUALLY ARE WHICH COULD LEAD TO

01:34:42.676 --> 01:34:44.278
SOME CONFUSION AND THERE'S JUST

01:34:44.345 --> 01:34:45.846
SOME LANGUAGE SECONDLY IN THE

01:34:45.913 --> 01:34:47.581
BILL THAT WERE WORRIED COULD --

01:34:47.648 --> 01:34:49.650
COULD BE INTERPRETED TO REQUIRE

01:34:49.717 --> 01:34:50.918
OBLIGATIONS OF DATA BROKERS THAT

01:34:50.985 --> 01:34:51.986
CONFLICT WITH OUR OBLIGATIONS

01:34:52.053 --> 01:34:53.421
UNDER THE SEA CPA I DON'T THINK

01:34:53.487 --> 01:34:54.755
THAT WAS THE INTENT AT ALL AND

01:34:54.822 --> 01:34:55.956
WE'RE JUST ASKING FOR SOME

01:34:56.023 --> 01:34:59.393

INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION.

01:35:07.034 --> 01:35:08.235
HOW WE ARE CURRENTLY OPPOSE

01:35:08.302 --> 01:35:09.937
BASED UPON THE CONCERNS HAVE

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

I HAVE A COUPLE OF CONCERNS WITH

01:35:21.482 --> 01:35:23.284
THE BILL MISTER JOHN -- MAYBE

01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:24.652
YOU CAN SHED SOME LIGHT ON THIS

01:35:24.718 --> 01:35:26.353
SO THE BILL AUTHORIZES THE

01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:28.823
ATTORNEY GENERAL TO IMPOSE A FEE.

01:35:28.889 --> 01:35:30.291
ON DATA BROKERS.

01:35:30.357 --> 01:35:31.826
NOT TO EXCEED THE REASONABLE

01:35:31.892 --> 01:35:34.095
COST OF REGULATION BUT THAT'S

01:35:34.161 --> 01:35:34.595
ALL IT SAYS.

01:35:34.662 --> 01:35:36.997
AND DO YOU MEAN WHEN YOU SAY

01:35:37.064 --> 01:35:38.432
COST OF REGULATION TO ME THE

01:35:38.499 --> 01:35:39.900
COST OF JUST MAINTAINING THE

01:35:39.967 --> 01:35:41.502
REGISTRY AND THE WEBSITE.

01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:43.971
THAT IS REQUIRED UNDER YOUR BILL

01:35:44.038 --> 01:35:45.673
OR DO YOU MEAN -- SO THE

01:35:45.739 --> 01:35:47.141
INVESTIGATION THAT THE ATTORNEY

01:35:47.208 --> 01:35:49.176
GENERAL WOULD DO INVOLVING DATA

01:35:49.243 --> 01:35:51.011
BROKERS TO ENFORCE OTHER AREAS

01:35:51.078 --> 01:35:52.713
OF CALIFORNIA LAW INCLUDING THE

01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:53.848
CCPA.

01:35:53.914 --> 01:35:56.684
ON WHAT I MEAN IS THAT WE WANT

01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:58.686
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE AG DOESN'T

01:35:58.752 --> 01:36:00.688
INCUR ANY COSTS THAT HE WOULD

01:36:00.754 --> 01:36:01.689
NOT BE ABLE.

01:36:01.755 --> 01:36:04.258
TO RECOVER SO IN ESSENCE I THINK

01:36:04.325 --> 01:36:07.261
OF IT -- IT'S AN UBER WHO'S YOU

01:36:07.328 --> 01:36:09.196

AND THEN TO MAINTAIN.

01:36:14.335 --> 01:36:15.970
OUR YOU KNOW TO BASICALLY FOR

01:36:16.036 --> 01:36:17.671
THE REGISTRY ITSELF WHATEVER TO

01:36:17.738 --> 01:36:19.640
REGISTRY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE

01:36:19.707 --> 01:36:19.940
AG'S GONNA.

01:36:20.007 --> 01:36:22.676
ARE HOPEFULLY RECOVER OKAY WELL

01:36:22.743 --> 01:36:24.612

A. G. M. TWO PRACTICES BY DATA

01:36:27.281 --> 01:36:28.716
BROKERS THAT VIOLATE OTHER THAT

01:36:28.782 --> 01:36:29.950
THEY'RE CONCERNED VIOLATE OTHER

01:36:30.017 --> 01:36:31.619
USE OF CALIFORNIA STATE LAWS THE

01:36:31.685 --> 01:36:32.286
COST.

01:36:32.353 --> 01:36:33.454
OF THOSE INVESTIGATIONS

01:36:33.521 --> 01:36:34.522
RECOVERABLE.

01:36:34.588 --> 01:36:36.090
UNDER YOU KNOW INCLUDING IS THAT

01:36:36.157 --> 01:36:36.891
INCLUDED IN THE COST OF

01:36:36.957 --> 01:36:38.492
REGULATION THAT'S NOT BEING

01:36:38.559 --> 01:36:39.760
MENTIONED IN THIS BILL BUT I

01:36:39.827 --> 01:36:42.263
THINK IF THE AG HAS.

01:36:42.329 --> 01:36:44.298
TO CONDUCT ANY INVESTIGATION ARE

01:36:44.365 --> 01:36:46.133
YOU KNOW PURSUANT TO ANY PORTION

01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:48.102
OF THE LAW THEN THERE'S PROBABLY

01:36:48.169 --> 01:36:49.703
ARE A PROVISION THAT WILL

01:36:49.770 --> 01:36:50.938
PROVIDE FOR THAT WHICH I COULD

01:36:51.005 --> 01:36:52.339
LOOK INTO THAT WOULD BE MORE BUT

01:36:52.406 --> 01:36:54.208
THIS BILL DOESN'T PROVIDE. FOR

01:36:54.275 --> 01:36:55.743
FOR THAT BECAUSE THE RECOVERY

01:36:55.809 --> 01:36:57.344
OKAY WELL IN THAT MY PROBLEM

01:36:57.411 --> 01:36:58.979
WITH THE BILL IS THAT IT IS NOT

01:36:59.046 --> 01:37:00.681
CLEAR TO ME THAT IT DOESN'T.

01:37:00.748 --> 01:37:02.116

FULCRUM -- AND THAT BALLOTS.

01:47:46.893 --> 01:47:49.462
I'M WONDERING IN THIS CASE.

01:47:49.529 --> 01:47:51.531
WHAT WE'RE EXPECTING CONSUMERS

01:47:51.598 --> 01:47:53.133
TO DO WITH THIS INFORMATION THAT

01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:54.134
I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS BILL

01:47:54.201 --> 01:47:55.202
AND I WAS IN A FAST FOOD

01:47:55.268 --> 01:47:56.536
RESTAURANT THIS WEEKEND?

01:47:56.603 --> 01:47:58.705
AND I SAW PROP SIXTY FIVE NOTICE

01:47:58.772 --> 01:47:59.840
THAT MENTION A CHEMICAL THAT I'D

01:47:59.906 --> 01:48:01.675
NEVER HEARD OF AND I WONDERED

01:48:01.741 --> 01:48:02.742
WHAT I WHAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO

01:48:02.809 --> 01:48:04.411
WITH THAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO TURN

01:48:04.477 --> 01:48:05.745
AROUND AND WALK OUT.

01:48:05.812 --> 01:48:06.880
BECAUSE THIS CHEMICALS KNOWN TO

01:48:06.947 --> 01:48:09.082
CAUSE CANCER IN MIGHT BE PRESENT

01:48:09.149 --> 01:48:10.617
IN THAT RESTAURANT I DON'T THINK.

01:48:10.684 --> 01:48:12.352
THAT ANY CONSUMER WOULD ACTUALLY

01:48:12.419 --> 01:48:14.120
DO THAT AND I'M MORE I'M

01:48:14.187 --> 01:48:15.088

01:48:17.958 --> 01:48:19.226
YOU'RE WALKING INTO.

01:48:19.292 --> 01:48:21.127

THAT USEFUL TO ME AS A CONSUMER

01:48:25.265 --> 01:48:27.834
I THINK IT'S A IT'S A STEP ABOUT

01:48:27.901 --> 01:48:29.903
TO RAISE AWARENESS OF IN THE

01:48:29.970 --> 01:48:31.304

01:48:38.278 --> 01:48:39.079
COMBINED WITH.

01:48:39.145 --> 01:48:40.647

ONGOING KIND OF A A PROJECT I

01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:02.068

01:49:04.604 --> 01:49:07.007
OF TO BRING AWARENESS ON OF THIS

01:49:07.073 --> 01:49:08.375
PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY TO

01:49:08.441 --> 01:49:09.776
CONSUMERS AT A DAY WHEN THEY

WOULD BE A SECOND NOW.

01:49:21.888 --> 01:49:23.823
IN A SECOND AREA OF VEHICLE OKAY

01:49:23.890 --> 01:49:25.292
WELL IT'S JUST NOT IT'S CLEAR TO

01:49:25.358 --> 01:49:27.360

01:49:43.076 --> 01:49:44.377
I'M NOT SURE THAT WE HAVE AN

01:49:44.444 --> 01:49:47.213
EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY OVER OUR

01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:48.481
FACE IF WE CHOOSE TO LOSE OUR WE

01:49:48.548 --> 01:49:50.450
ARE FACE EXPOSED FOR IN A PUBLIC

01:49:50.517 --> 01:49:51.217
PLACE.

01:49:51.284 --> 01:49:52.419
WHERE WE LIVE IN AN ERA AND I

01:49:52.485 --> 01:49:53.653
THINK WE'RE ALL AWARE OF IT?

01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:55.522
WHERE THERE COULD BE A DRONE A

01:49:55.588 --> 01:49:56.189
THOUSAND FEET ABOVE US THE WITH

01:49:56.256 --> 01:49:57.590
THE CAMERA AND THEN OF THAT THAT

01:49:57.657 --> 01:49:59.159
JUST THAT JUST A FACT OF LIVING

01:49:59.225 --> 01:50:05.966
IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY SO --

01:50:06.032 --> 01:50:06.733
I IT'S IT'S HARD FOR ME TO TO

01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:07.968
SEE HOW THIS IS A USEFUL TOOL.

01:50:08.034 --> 01:50:08.835
WELL I THINK ANOTHER WAY TO LOOK

01:50:08.902 --> 01:50:10.770
OUT TO LOOK AT IT IS THAT -- I

01:50:10.837 --> 01:50:12.372
FIRST OF ALL ON MAKING SURE THAT

01:50:12.439 --> 01:50:13.807
THE CONSUMER IS A WHERE.

01:50:13.873 --> 01:50:15.809
ARE ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY IN

01:50:15.875 --> 01:50:18.378
NUMBER TWO ALL PERHAPS IF THAT

01:50:18.445 --> 01:50:19.813
CONSUMER DOESN'T WANT.

01:50:19.879 --> 01:50:22.749
TO OF THE CAPTURE ODD NOTED IN A

01:50:22.816 --> 01:50:24.918
BY THESE MACHINES AND HE OR SHE

01:50:24.985 --> 01:50:25.518
COULD PROBABLY SHOP SOMEWHERE

01:50:25.585 --> 01:50:26.286
ELSE.

01:50:26.353 --> 01:50:28.421
OR YOU KNOW BRING BRING THAT --

01:50:28.488 --> 01:50:29.055
TO THE ATTENTION OF THIS TO THE

01:50:29.122 --> 01:50:31.658
STORE OWNER -- YOU KNOW PERHAPS

01:50:31.725 --> 01:50:32.359
YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S BEEN

01:50:32.425 --> 01:50:33.493
MENTIONED WHETHER OR NOT WE

01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:35.362
WANTED TO OPT IN AS AS OPPOSED

01:50:35.428 --> 01:50:36.696
TO OPT OUT.

01:50:36.763 --> 01:50:37.964
SO CURRENTLY IT'S OPT OUT

01:50:38.031 --> 01:50:40.133
BASICALLY SO IF THE CONSUMERS

01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:41.935
FULLY AWARE OF THAT --

01:50:42.002 --> 01:50:44.104
TECHNOLOGY THEN HE CAN -- TALK

01:50:44.170 --> 01:50:46.039
TO THE MANAGER I WON MY

01:50:46.106 --> 01:50:47.907
INFORMATION TO BE THE DELETED.

01:50:47.974 --> 01:50:50.010
SO THAT THAT WOULD BE ONE OF

01:50:50.076 --> 01:50:52.145
CONSEQUENCE OF ALL OF US

01:50:52.212 --> 01:50:52.746
SOMETHING LIKE THIS I MEAN I
