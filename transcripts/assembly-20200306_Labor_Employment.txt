AND WELCOME TO THE SIXTY FIRST ASSEMBLY DISTRICT TO RIVERSIDE. AND THANK YOU TO COUNSEL AND EDWARD. OPENING UP. COUNCIL CHAMBER- TO US FOR THIS HEARING. THERE IS PROBABLY NO TOPIC. IT IS MORE CONTROVERSIAL. THEN THE TOPIC THE WAREHOUSE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. WHEN I WAS ELECTED SEVEN YEARS AGO- THE FORMER MAYOR RON LEVERAGE CONVENE HERE IN THIS VERY CHAMBER- A MEETING. TO DISCUSS WHETHER WAREHOUSE- WORK WOULD LEAD TO MIDDLE CLASS TO THE MIDDLE CLASS. AND WE WERE JOINED- AT THAT TIME BY USC PROFESSOR ONE A LOT OF. HIS BOOK IN ONE SHIP REYES SPACE AND CAPITAL IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS VERY INFORMED IF YOU WERE TO DRIVE FROM RIGHT HERE- ACROSS THE SIXTY FIRST ASSEMBLY DISTRICT FOR MARINO VALLEY TO PREPARE. YOU WOULD SEE NOTHING BUT ONE WAREHOUSE AFTER ANOTHER. BUT WAREHOUSES IN THE INLAND EMPIRE OUR- ARE A MATTER OF A FACT AND GOOD FOR WORST THEY'RE GOING TO REMAIN WITH. BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT SOME OF THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF WAREHOUSE. THE TRUCK TRAFFIC. TO THE AIR POLLUTION TWO PEOPLE WHO HOUSES- A RIGHT NEAR. RIGHT ACROSS I ACTUALLY VISITED ONE HOUSE. IN MARINO VALLEY. OF THE WAREHOUSE WAS BUILT RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE- SO IF YOU WANT TO FILL A CHAMBER. WHETHER IT BE- IN DECEMBER NINETEEN OH IN MARINO VALLEY OR RIVERSIDE JUST BRING UP THE TOPIC OF WAREHOUSE LAST YEAR I WAS ABLE TO GET LEGISLATION PASSED. AB TWENTY EIGHT FIFTY THREE. AND WAS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR IT SAYS THAT IS CITY. ARE GOING TO USE TAXPAYER MONEY. TO ENTICE WAREHOUSES TO COME THERE SHOULD BE GREATER TRANSPARENCY. AN EFFORT THAT I THINK WAS A VERY WORTHWHILE WE'VE WE'VE HEARD THANK YOU. YOU SEE OUR PROFESSOR THOMAS PATTERSON. WROTE THE BOOK EIGHT POINTS TO WAREHOUSE HISTORICAL POLITICAL ECONOMY. OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ILLINOIS. AND WE HAVE WITH THIS THE OP OF THE UC BERKELEY'S. THE FUTURE WAREHOUSE WORK TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IN US JUSTICE INDUSTRY. SO WHETHER IT IS WORKERS AND WELCOME TO THE WAREHOUSE WORKERS THAT ARE HERE. UNION MEMBERS FOR MOTHERS COME TO SEE ME. LATINO MOTHERS COME TO VISIT MY OFFICE SPEAK ME BECAUSE THEY TELL ME. THEY WANT MORE FOR THEIR CHILDREN THEN TO BE WAREHOUSE WORK. AND I AND I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE HERE THAT THE WORK FORCE IN THE WAREHOUSE INDUSTRY IS BY AND LARGE LET THE- SO WHAT ARE THE PLUSES WHETHER THE MINUSES. FOR THIS REGION. AND FOR THE INDUSTRY THROUGHOUT. CALIFORNIA UNITED STATES I THINK THERE'S SOME OF THE TOPICS THAT WE WILL DISCUSS TODAY AND I WOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO SEE IN THE MORNING. IT IS THE DISCUSSION THAT'S BEEN GOING ON HERE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE FOR QUITE AWHILE IT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT MORE AND HOPEFULLY THIS. HEARING WILL ADD TO THAT DISCUSSION. THANK YOU FOR COMING TO THE HI. THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING HERE. THANK YOU SEVEN THANKS FOR. YES ALL. THANK YOU I TO WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE. READING THIS HEARING HERE AS CHAIR OF THE LABOR COMMITTEE FOR THE STATE ASSEMBLY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THOSE HEARINGS TO BE HELD WHAT THE COMMUNITY AND I JOIN WITH MY COLLEAGUES ASSEMBLY MEDINA SAYING THANK YOU FOR SO LONG THE INLAND EMPIRE. I KNOW IT'S IN RIVERSIDE BUT I WILL CLEAN INLAND EMPIRE. THERE ARE SO MANY ISSUES THAT WE SEE AN END TO MY DEAR FRIEND HEARING THE NEWS- COUNCIL NUMBER WE'RE SO PROUD OF YOU. YEAH I DON'T YEAH YEAH AND SO LOOKING FORWARD TO EVERYTHING TO DO WITH A GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH. I I'VE BEEN VERY ABOUT WHERE MOST OF BECAUSE- IT'S THEY HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITY THAN MOST CONCERNED. MY GREATEST CONCERN I DO WANT THE JOB FOR THOSE WHO ARE BUILDING A WAREHOUSES DOES A GREAT JOB AND THEY GET TO STAY CLOSE TO HOME WELL THEY'RE BUILDING THE WAREHOUSES. SO THAT'S WONDERFUL. FOR EVERYBODY ELSE. IT JUST DOESN'T IT ISN'T A GOOD THING. WE KNOW THAT THE MAJORITY OF OUR WORKERS OR YOUNG MAN- YOU KNOW AND BLANK OVER 70% WE DO KNOW THAT THE RATE UNION JOBS IN THE WAREHOUSES DECREASED OVER THE YEARS WE KNOW THAT THERE'S AN INCREASE OF TEMPORARY WORK HEALTH WORKERS WHEN THAT HAPPENS THERE ARE LESS BENEFITS FOR WORKERS. THIS IS A MULTI BILLION DOLLARS. INDUSTRY AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS. SO MUCH MONEY TO BE MADE. PEOPLE WERE MAKING THE MONEY FOR THE OWNERS SHOULD BE INCREASED THE BENEFITS FOR THOSE WORKING IN FOR THOSE WHO ARE TAKING CARE OF THE WORK. OF THOSE THE ONES THAT NEED TO. THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES THAT ARE. SUFFERING THE MOST. WE DO KNOW THAT. THE IT IS MENTIONED EARLIER THE READING INJURY SO MUCH HIGHER- FOR WAREHOUSE WORKERS. THREE TIMES THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. WHEN YOU'RE WORKING IN A WAREHOUSE AND FOR THOSE WORKING IN AMAZON WERE HOUSES EVEN. AND IT'S JUST AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID BECAUSE OF THE TIMELINE. WISE IS LOOKING INTO GETTING AUTOMATIC NOTICES NOT EVEN HUMAN CONTACT. THE COMPUTERS TELLING YOU YOU'RE NOT WORKING FAST ENOUGH YOU HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH BOXES AND NOW YOU NEED TO STEP IT UP AND THEN YOU'VE GOT TO GET SENT TO RETRAINING AND YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW YOU YOU MIGHT BE FIRED. WITHOUT HUMAN BEING EVER TALKING TO. SOMETHING THE WRONG ABOUT THAT. BUT FOR ME HONESTLY THE BIGGEST ISSUE THAT I HAVE IS THE HUMAN IMPACT. KNOWING THAT NOT JUST ALL WORK IT'S ALSO ALL OF THOSE AROUND. FOR AMAZON MAYBE IT WAS VERY VOCAL AND JOIN WITH MANY LABOR AND- NOT EVERYBODY LABELS IN THE GREEN. WE STILL LOVE ALL OF OUR- PEOPLE ALL OF OUR PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THOSE LABOR. THE ISRAEL. WE HAVE TO FIND BETTER WAYS TO THIS IS THE INDUSTRY'S. IT'S GOING TO BE FOUND. THEY HAVE TO BE A BETTER WAY TO. WHETHER YOU TO ELECTRIFY COMING IN AND THEY'RE COMING. OR ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. THOSE WERE LONG LABOR BUT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. TO MAKE SURE. SO THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO FIGHT. SO NBA. TO WE GET THE FIND THEMSELVES TO BE ABLE TO GET THOSE CONTRACTS TO PROVIDE BENEFITS IN THE END WE OPEN THE AND- THE MOST RECENT ONE USED THE STATE'S CARPOOL JUST CENTER. ALMOST ONE MILLION SQUARE FEET. WE'RE I AM VERY PROUD OF. THE GENERAL IDEA OF THE SEVEN. THE LAWSUIT TO MORE OVERSIGHT. WE NEED MORE THAN MY COLLEAGUES. THE WAREHOUSE ACOSTA WE HAVE THE FAMILY. TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT BILLS IN THE BACKYARD. THE. ROACHES NOW HAVE YOU. BEEN DOING. IN THEIR BACKYARD THERE'S A SENSE BY. JUST WON'T JUST ONE THERE'S A LOT TO BE DONE I AM VERY PROUD OF MY COLLEAGUES FOR THE LEGISLATION HE INTRODUCED. GOT BY BOTH HOUSES AND GOT IT SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR- THAT THAT WAS A BIG. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO LEARNING SO MUCH MORE THANK YOU MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU SO MUCH SO THAT YOU CAN SEE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER WHERE IS. AFTER HERE THE WE HAVE A- MORE ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT. AND GEN DOESN'T SOME OF THE- YOUR THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON SOME OF THE ISSUE. THE SUPPLY CHAIN THANK. YOU JUST. WE GOT TOGETHER. TODAY AND SO. WHEN I HAVE. THE FIRST ONE. THIS YEAR IS OVER HI GENE. AND THE SECOND. AND SO THEN YOU START BY. ONE TIME PANEL. TAKE OVER. PANEL THE- QUESTION THE BILL HANDLES OR WILL BE NOT TO FOR PUBLIC HE DOES HAVE A COMMENT. SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO WELCOME FIRST. WILL PROVIDE THAT. WITH US TODAY MICHAEL. THIS IS THE BEST ACTIVE RESERVE. MICHAEL BASIS THE BEST ECONOMIC. I OR SIDE. I WOULD BE THE BEST A SOCIOLOGY EACH YEAR LABOR STUDIES AT THE OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE GOOD TO HAVE LOCAL ACADEMIC YEAR OF THAT. IS ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS CHICAGO. PROBABLY GRAY THAT SHE CAME ALL THE WAY HERE FROM CHICAGO WHEN SHE HEARD ABOUT. DISCUSSING SHARE TIME WITH SOME OF THOSE ISSUES THAT SHARE BECAUSE HE OF THE WAREHOUSE WORKER RESOURCE CENTER. AND THEN THE FORGET OF TEAMSTERS LOCAL NINETY THIRTY TWO I BELIEVE. TO YOU ARE BEST SUITABLE PRESENT JOINT LEAD. EIGHT MINUTES. ALSO. YEAH SO BUSTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR- THE KIND INTRODUCTION- MICHAEL BASS FISHING SOME OF OUR- OUR STATE OF. REPORT ON THE HIGHER. DEVELOPING RESEARCH. ALL THE WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT THE UNEMPLOYMENT RECOVERY IN THE INLAND EMPIRE AND IMPRESSIVE. GAINES OUTPACING THE REST OF CALIFORNIA IN THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE THIS IS BEEN SPURRED BY- JOB GROWTH IN BOTH SIDES AND BRING YOUR COUNTY- THAT ABOUT A STROKE- AND THE REST OF CALIFORNIA. STILL YOU WONDER ABOUT WHAT THE QUALITY OF THE JOBS ARE- AS WORKERS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE LESS ACCESS TO FULL TIME FOR YOUR JOB- AND ARE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE EMPLOYER PROVIDED HEALTH INSURANCE. AND IN GENERAL WORKERS IN THE IN THE IN THE EMPIRE. I TO BREAKING NUMBERS TO THEIR- OVERALL 38% OF WORKERS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE- MAKE. THIRTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS OR ABOVE ALL THAT NUMBER COMES FROM- A LIVING WAGE STANDARD- PROVIDE BY REPORTS OUT OF AND I. ALSO AS YOU CAN SEE- DIFFERENTIALS IN THIS GOOD JOB RATE- LARGE WHEN WE CONSIDER- GENDER AS WELL AS WITH THE- NOW WHY IS NOT THE CASE- WE LOOK AT THE TOP FIVE- PULLING INDUSTRY. AND I'M HIGHER. THEN WE TAKE FIVE TO MAY TAKE AWAY FROM THIS. THE FIRST IS WITHIN EACH OF THOSE FIVE INDUSTRIES WORKERS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE MAKE LESS THAN THE STATE AVERAGE OR FOR IT IN THE- LAST SEVEN CALIFORNIA- THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE TRANSPORTATION AND WAREHOUSING. ALL OF THIS MAKES 28% LAST. ALL THE WORKERS- WITHIN THE INDUSTRY THE REST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE SECOND BIG TAKE AWAY FROM THIS IS THAT ALL FIVE INDUSTRIES. ARE RELATIVELY LOW PAYING AND THAT THEY PAY LESS THAN THE STATE AVERAGE- IN MONTHLY OVERALL. SO THERE'S- WERE OVER REPRESENTED IN LOOKING INDUSTRIES- AND WE ARE UNDER- REPRESENTED IN HIGHER. THE PLACES WHERE THE MOST DRAMATIC OR PROFESSIONAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNIQUE TECHNICAL JOBS OF FINANCE AND INSURANCE AND INFORMATION SERVICE. IN OUR FUTURE WORK THAT WE'RE WE'RE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT- THAT JOB GROWTH AND WHAT KINDS OF JOBS- THOSE ARE TO TAKE DEFINITIONS OF JOBS- PROVIDE BY THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION BUT THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE JOB. ALL THAT LEAD TO THOSE GOOD JOBS. AND ALL OTHER CASES WE'RE GOING TO CONSIDER THIS SEPARATELY- BASED ON WHETHER OR NOT- CALLS TO RESERVE FIVE FOR THE FOR THE JOB. TO WONDER WHAT ARE THEY INDUSTRY ALL THAT EVERYBODY'S JOB AND WHAT IS HAPPENING. IN INDUSTRIES AND ALSO OCCUPATION OVER TIME. SO THIS NEXT FIGURE IS SHOWING IMPLEMENT SHARE FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN INDUSTRY WITH THE MOST GOOD. JOBS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. THE BIG TAKEAWAY HERE IS THAT THE INDUSTRIES AND RIDE OUR JOB WITH INFORMATION SHARED ON GROWING. AND THE JOB FOR THE IN ON OTHER ENVELOPE THAT THE DIAGONAL LINE OF THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH- IN CONSIDERATION SO- IN TRANSPORTATION THE PROVIDE A LOT OF THE JOB- ABOUT. TO BE GROWING AND IN THE INLAND EMPIRE MANY BACKING TRADITIONALLY HAS PROVIDED MANY GOOD JOB AND THEY STILL DO ALL OF THE EMPLOYMENT YEAR. THE LAST DECADE. SIMILARLY WE DO THAT. THE EXERCISE MY- THE OCCUPATION IN WHICH THAT ARE PROVIDING A LOT OF GOOD JOBS AND ACCESSIBLE JOBS. THAT ARE GROWING. IN INSTALLATION MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE JOBS- THAT ARE TREATING LARGE SUPERVISOR POSITION I'M NOT RUNNING FOR THE- MANY INDUSTRY- REALLY REMOVING FROM THE LADDER OF JOB WORKERS WITHOUT. I THINK THE REST OF MY- OVER THE PHONE WITH. IN THE- FIRE. YEAH ENTRY LEVEL OF BLUE COLLAR WAREHOUSE WORKERS. WAREHOUSE ASSOCIATES ARE IN ABOUT FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR PLUS BENEFITS BUT THIS IS NOT ENOUGH- GIVEN THE HIGH COST OF LIVING IS SPECIALLY TO SUPPORT A FAMILY- CONSISTENT WITH THAT THE ECONOMIC ROUND TABLE HAS JUST ISSUED A REPORT A VERY GOOD ONE- KNOWN AS TOO BIG TO GOVERN. IT FOUND THAT MOST AMAZON WAREHOUSE WORKERS WERE STRUGGLING FINANCIALLY THEY FOUND THAT TIME FULL YEAR WAREHOUSE WORKER. AVERAGE OF MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE END OF IT MOST OF THIS WAS IN MEDICAID AND MANY OF THESE. WORKERS COULD NOT AFFORD IT THE HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN OFFERED BY AMAZON FOR THEIR FAMILIES. OF 57% OF THESE WORKERS OF FULL TIME FULL YEAR WAREHOUSE WORKERS WERE LIVING IN OVERCROWDED AND SUB STANDARD HOUSING. MORE CLOSELY AT OF THE CONDITIONS FOR AMAZON WAREHOUSE WORKERS IN A WORK WITH A TEAM OF RESEARCHERS AT UC RIVERSIDE TO COLLECT INTERVIEWS FROM FORTY FOUR FORMER AND YOU MOVE ON WE'RE HOUSE. FOR AND THEY HAD A LOT OF STORIES ABOUT THE- JOB QUALITY OF MANY OF THESE WORKERS WERE WE THE SEASONAL WORKERS TURNOVER WAS VERY VERY HIGH. WORK A REPORTER WAS PHYSICALLY GRUELING AND EXHAUSTING THE WORKS JUST FOR VERY LONG FOR FULL TIME WORKERS. NEARLY ALL OF THEM AGREED THAT THEY WERE HE OR EXHAUSTION BY THE END OF THEIR WORK IN THESE WORKS AT. THE LAST HOURS AT THE MINIMUM USUALLY MORE RIGHT IF THERE'S HIGHER CUSTOMER DEMAND THEY'RE ASKED TO WORK OVERTIME. AND IS A VERY HARD FOR WORKERS TO COMBINE ESPECIALLY FOR COLLEGE. STUDENTS THAT ARE TRYING TO GET A DEGREE YOU GET A BETTER JOB. WERE FOR THOSE WITH YOUNG CHILDREN OR OR TAKING CARE OF AND THEN THERE ALSO PRESSURED TO WORK VERY VERY FAST- PRESSURE TO MAKE RATE. THESE DAYS IN THE IN THE AMAZON WAREHOUSES OR FACE TERMINATION THIS IS. VERY VERY STRESSFUL IN THIS ALSO PUT PRESSURE ON THEM. TO NOT FOLLOW THE SAFETY PROCEDURES RIGHT BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T. THEY THEY HAVE TO MAKE THE RATE OR THEY MIGHT GET. FROM THESE WORK RATES ARE REALLY REALLY STRINGENT VERY HIGH AND THEY OFTEN SEEM TO BE GOING UP. THEY ARE ALSO BEING- SURVEILLED ELECTRONICALLY IN TERMS OF NOT JUST THEIR WORK RATE FOR THEIR ERROR RATE. TIME ON. TASK ALL. YEAH THIS PRESSURE ON THEM NOT TO USE THE BATHROOM NOT TO FOLLOW SAFETY PROCEDURES. SO THIS IS TAKING A REAL HOLE RIGHT ON TOP OF THE FACT THAT THE WORK BREAKS ARE OFTEN INSUFFICIENT GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE FACILITIES AND HOW LONG IT TAKES TO GET. THE BREAK ROOM OR THE REST. RIGHT WITH THIS I WOULD DEAL HAD AN INVESTIGATIVE REPORT THAT FOUND THAT IT WAS ON INJURY RATES OR EVEN HIGHER THAN THE INDUSTRY AVERAGE RATE OF ABOUT ONE OUT OF EVERY TEN FULL TIME IT WAS A WORKERS- HAS. INJURY IN THE EVEN HIGHER IN THE AUTOMATED WE'RE HOUSES. SUCH AS THE ONE EASY FAIL THERE THE RATES. EVEN HIGHER WITH SEVENTEEN. SIX HUNDRED WORKERS WERE WERE ANYTHING INJURY. WHAT IS A BRING SOME OF THE VOICES OF AMAZON WAREHOUSE WORKERS INTO THE ROOM- SO THESE ARE ALL FROM FORMER FAMILIES ON WORKERS THEY WERE WORKING AS WERE HEALTH WORKERS WAS THAT I WAS ALWAYS SCARED EVERY DAY BECAUSE I WASN'T MAKING. REYES ANOTHER TOLD AS THE RATES ARE JUST TOO DEMANDING AN ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE AT TIMES AND IT'S A VERY STRESSFUL THE WORKERS. THERE'S EVEN BIG PIECES DOCUMENTED FOR PEOPLE TRIED TO COMMIT SUICIDE. BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT MEETING THE RATE IN THE FEAR LOSING THEIR JOB AT AMAZON BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND EFFECTIVE NEWSWEEK RIGHT. HELLO CORD ABOUT. SUICIDE. THERE WAS ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT HEALTH AND SAFETY OF WHAT WORK REPORTED IT IT WAS A LITTLE TOO MUCH FOR ME PHYSICALLY I HAD BRUISES ALL OVER MY LEGS BECAUSE OF THE BOXES I WAS THROWING AROUND ANOTHER REPORTED I ONLY WORKED THERE FOR THREE MONTHS AND I WAS ALREADY HAVING BACK PROBLEMS WITH THAT I WAS TWENTY YEARS OLD AND I HAD BACK PROBLEMS THAT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN HE WAS NOT ALONE IN THE WORKPLACE REPORTING BACK INJURIES WE ALSO HEARD ABOUT REPETITIVE MOTION INJURIES AND- SEVERAL THE- WE REPORTED HAVING. THE LOUD CHEERING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU THE. YEAH. THANKS SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME REALLY PLEASURE TO BE HERE- WHAT I PRESENTED A NEW RESEARCH FROM MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE. FOR YOU. BASED ON EXTENSIVE INTERVIEWS THAT WE DID WITH THEIR HOUSE OPERATORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ABOUT THE PLAN- FOR THE MEETING. NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN THEIR WAREHOUSE. TECHNOLOGY. THE TECHNOLOGY OF WHAT DO THEIR JOB MORE EASILY BETTER SOON WAREHOUSES THE INCREASING USE OF TECHNOLOGY REPRESENTS A WIN FOR EVERYONE COULD MANUAL JOB YOU NEED BETTER FIRMS ACHIEVE MORE EFFICIENCY COULD CUSTOMERS BENEFIT. SO THE MAIN QUESTION OF THIS RESEARCH WHAT DOES THE- TECHNOLOGY REPRESENTS. ANY SORT THE ANSWER IS NOT WITHOUT. OUR RESEARCH FOUND THAT OVER THE NEXT DECADE JOB QUALITY IS LIKELY TO CHANGE AND COULD BECOME SIGNIFICANTLY MORE. IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE JOB QUALITY IS A BIGGER ISSUE THAN JOB LONG. RIGHT THIS AREA ABOUT. THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO FOR MOST FACILITIES IS NOT ALONE AUTOMATION PARTIAL AUTOMATION AND LABOR AUGMENTATION WITH POTENTIAL NEGATIVE EFFECT ON JOBS. SO RATHER THAN WIDESPREAD AUTOMATION IN THE NEAR TERM AND WE'RE TALKING THE NEXT DECADE. THIS IS IN THE PIECE OF WORK PROCESS AND DISTILLING JOBS. IN NEW FORMS OF SURVEILLANCE AND MANAGEMENT VOICE UNDERMINE LOOKING. THAT'S THE NEXT WORKERS WHERE THE MAJORITY OF THE WORK FORCE IN CALIFORNIA WILL DISPROPORTIONATELY BEAR THE BRUNT OF THE CHANGE. AND THE LEADING EDGE IS DRIVEN BY. AND ECONOMY AND AMAZON IS PLAYING A SUBSTANTIAL IN REMAKING THE COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS. WE'RE HOUSING INDUSTRY EMPLOYS ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DIRECT HIRE WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA BUT THIS IS A BAD UNDER ESTIMATE GIVEN THE- TEMPORARY. NEARLY HALF OF THOSE WORKERS ARE HERE IN THE RIVERSIDE SAN BERNARDINO ONTARIO MSA MAJORITY WAREHOUSE WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA THAT NIXON BLACK. IS THE FRONTLINE WORKERS IN LARGELY MANUAL LABOR JOBS. WANT TO GET TO THE- YES THIS CHART IS IMPORTANT- RESEARCH SHOWS EMPLOYMENT IN RED AND WE JUST MOVED IN HERE IS THAT INFLATION ADJUSTED WAGES IN THE INDUSTRY HAVE ACTUALLY FALLEN TWO THOUSAND ONE IT'S OTHER MOST RAPID DECLINE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AT THE SAME TIME EMPLOYMENT ROSE SHARPLY THIS IS COUNTER INTUITIVE. ARE AT WHEN EMPLOYMENT DEMAND RISES CLASSIC ECONOMIC MODELS PREDICT THAT WAGES WILL RISE TO THE TAKE AWAY IN WAREHOUSING IS THAT WE JUST HAS STAGNATED FOR NEARLY TWO DECADES THEY'RE FALLING NOW AND THEY ARE THE LOWEST POINT. TWO THOUSAND ONE. WHEN HOUSING IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EFFICIENT OPERATION OF THE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION SO SUPPLY AND DEMAND. NEEDS IN A WAREHOUSE IT'S A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF FIRMS COMPETITIVE STRATEGIES. BUT IT'S BEEN A LAGGARD IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGICAL ADOPTION FOR A FEW REASONS. ONE VERY NARROW MARGIN NEED THAT THE INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COST SENSITIVE. THIS BAND FINANCIAL CONSERVATISM RESULT IN RISK OF VERSION FOUR FIRMS TRY TO AVOID TAKING ON RISK FOR SHIFTED TO ON TO OTHER COMPANIES. LIKE SUBCONTRACTORS AND TEMP AGENCIES. AND BECAUSE OF THIS OUTSOURCING IS A PREVALENT PRACTICING WAREHOUSE. OUTSOURCING DYNAMICS HAVE TENDED TO SLOW THE PROCESS OF INNOVATION. FINALLY THE INDUSTRIES IS IN THE MIDST OF A PEOPLE ROBBED BY YOU COMMERCE. WHICH INTRODUCES NEW DYNAMICS INTO WAREHOUSE PROPHECIES. ON THE ONE HAND YOU HAVE A VERY LABOR INTENSIVE PROCESS OF ASSEMBLING BE COMMERCE SUPPORTERS. AND ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE ROOMS COMPETING WITH AMAZON'S ABILITY TO DELIVER QUICKLY WHICH IS SHAPED CONSUMER EXPECTATIONS CROSS THE BORDER. AMAZON IS HAVING WIDESPREAD EFFECT ACROSS THE RETAIL AND LOGISTICS SECTORS. WE'RE HEADING TOWARD CHANGES IN THE QUALITY OF JOBS IN WAREHOUSES FIRST AND FOREMOST WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE WORK INTENSIFICATION. ROSE WITH HIS HEART ON BODIES AS WE'VE HEARD. THAT THAT THERE'S A POTENTIAL TO THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO REDUCE- THE MOST ARDUOUS ACTIVITIES LIKE TWISTING AND LIFTING. HOWEVER OUR RESEARCH FOUND THAT THOSE GAINS MAY BE CANCELED OUT. INCREASES IN WORKLOAD AND PIECE OF WORK. ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS IS A HANGING BAG OVER. EACH BAG HOLDS TOGETHER KIND OF ITEM IS DELIVERED TO WORK STATION YOU SEE HERE THE WORKERS. THIS IS THE RULES WALKING AND CAN REDUCE EXPOSURE TO OTHER ORGANS ARE GOING ON THE WRIST. BUT IT ALSO SERVES TO CLOSELY TRACK THE PRODUCTIVITY OF WORKERS AND PIECES THEIR WORK I CONSTANTLY DELIVERING PACKAGES TO THE WORKER ADDED TO FIND ME. THE SECOND CHANGE IS DE SKILLING WHICH IS THE PROCESS OF BREAKING UP A JOB INTO SMALLER TASKS. AND FIGURING OUT WHICH ACTIVITIES TO SIMPLIFY SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY. WE NEED TO PROVIDE TASK TO EXPAND THE POTENTIAL WORKFORCE FOR EXAMPLE YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO HIRE TEMPORARY WORKERS BECAUSE YOU REMOVE THE NEED FOR ANY FAMILIARITY WITH THE WAREHOUSE. IT ALSO SHORTENS TRAINING TIME AND REDUCES YOUR TURN OVER FIVE. DIFFERENT PLAYERS IT'S A WIN. FOR WORKERS IT COULD MEAN LOWER WAGES AND MORE CHURNING THROUGH TEMPORARY JOB. AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THAT FOLLOW ME ON A MOBILE ROBOT SHOWN HERE. IT LEADS WORKERS ACROSS THE WAREHOUSE FACING THEM AS THEY WALK AND PICK BORDERS IT SIMPLIFIES THE ORDER OF SELECTION PROCESS. THE SYSTEM REMOVES ALL DECISION MAKING BY THE WORKERS AND SET THE WATER SPEED AND ROUTE. BY SIMPLIFYING THE PROCESS ANY PLAYER COULD BRING SOMEONE IN OFF THE STREET VIRTUALLY TETHER THEM TO THIS CARD. IN A WAY THEY- THE FINAL BUDGET OF CHANGE IS SURVEILLANCE AN ALGORITHMIC MANAGEMENT. I WOULD MAKE MANAGEMENT INTRODUCES NEW FORMS OF WORKPLACE CONTROL WHERE THE REGULATION OF WITH THIS PERFORMANCE IS GRANULAR. SCALABLE AND POTENTIALLY REMEMBER. THIS IS NEW I VISIBILITY TO MONITOR WITH THIS PRECISE MOVEMENTS AT DALY SOMETHING'S NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO BEFORE. THERE'S VERY LITTLE TRANSPARENCY INTO WHAT DATA IS BEING COLLECTED FOR WHAT PURPOSE AND HOW IT'S BEING USED AND STORED. AND THERE'S NO TRANSPARENCY INTO THE SOFTWARE RULES THAT ARE MANAGING AND GOVERNING WORK PLACES. THERE ARE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL ON UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT COULD RESULT SMALL. EMPLOYEE MORALE COULD BE DAMAGED. TURN OVER FIFTY INCREASE OVER WORK AND BURN OUT. THE MOST ALARMING ARE THE POTENTIAL HEALTH AND SAFETY IMPACT. THE WORKERS ARE AT AN ELEVATED RISK OF INJURY BUT WHEN YOU ADD INCREASED WORKLOAD AND SPEED UP TO THE MIX. ATTENTION FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY RISK INCREASE. THE LONG TERM PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT. ARE VERY POORLY UNDERSTOOD. TECHNOLOGY IN THAT ARE INHERENTLY GOOD OR BAD HUMANS CREATE TECHNOLOGY WE BAKE OUR BIASES IN ON THE FRONT HAND AND WE MAKE CHOICES ABOUT HOW TO GET IMPLEMENTED ON THE BACK AND NONE OF THIS IS. PRE DETERMINED. WHAT THE VOICE REGULATION AND VERY CLOSE ATTENTION NEW HEALTH AND SAFETY WITH. WITH OUR VITAL IN SHAPING THE PATH OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE. WAREHOUSE OPERATOR STAND TO GAIN SUBSTANTIALLY THE NEW TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES THE QUESTION IS HOW THESE GAMES WILL BE DISTRIBUTED. AND WE HAVE TO START NOW TO WHAT A WIN LOSE PROPOSITION FOR SHORT TERM BENEFITS CAPTION BY THE INDUSTRY IN THE LONG RUN COSTS ARE BORNE BY WORKERS IN THE- THANK. THANK YOU DOCTOR. NEXT UP. DOES THE WAREHOUSE WORKERS OR- GOOD MORNING- THANK YOU HAVE FOR HAVING US HERE I'M SURE SHE ON THE DRUG FOR THE WAREHOUSE WITH RESOURCE CENTER WORK ORGANIZATION BASED IN THE INLAND EMPIRE FOCUSED ON IMPROVING JOBS IN THE- REGION. WHAT WE DO IS WE DO EDUCATION ADVOCACY ACTION WE SUPPORTED. WORKERS WHO'VE BEEN DEALING WITH ISSUES INCLUDING WAY STUFF SO WE SUPPORT WORKERS. TO COLLECT OVER THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN LOST WAGES OF THE LAST. SEVEN YEARS- WE DEAL A LOT WITH WORKERS SIMPLICITY STAFFING AGENCIES OR HAVE CONTINUED IN SHORT TERM EMPLOYMENT. THE HUGE PROBLEM WAREHOUSE SECTOR. SO GAGE THOUSANDS OF WORKERS TO. TAKE ACTION THE WORKPLACE TO DEMAND- FULL TIME- FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT FROM IMPLEMENT. IT WILL DO A LOT OF WORK RUN HEALTH AND SAFETY- WORK WITH CAL OSHA AND OTHER AGENCIES TO- GET SITUATION COVERING OVER TWELVE THOUSAND WORKERS TO. CONDITIONS. IN THERE WHILE. YEAH BE NO RIVERSIDE LA COUNTY SO I SHOULD TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT WHAT WE SEE IN THE IN THE NONUNION SECTOR OF THE WAREHOUSE INDUSTRY BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU IS. GIVE YOU A LITTLE US RESEARCH THAT DONE ON THIS IN OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS SO THE FEW. OF THE REFERRING TO ONE IS REPORT THAT SHE CANNOT THEY NATIONAL ROB LOVE. TOGETHER TIME FOR THIS PANEL THEY'RE DOING SOME ON JOURNAL. AND TELL YOU ABOUT THAT IT'S A HUGE ISSUE THAT. NOT ONLY ARE THE- IN THIS INDUSTRY. BUT THERE'S HIGH TURNOVER BECAUSE- WORKERS ARE ABLE TO KEEP UP FOR. WORKERS FEEL LIKE IT'S NOT THE KIND OF JOB THEY WANT. TO SO THE REPORTS. YEAH AND TURN OVER OR AT THE- IN. YET NOT A GROUND TO IN LOS ANGELES GIVE A LAST. TO THE TO THE TO GOVERN. THE DIG INTO AN- OF PRESS. INCIDENT LA OR- RIVERSIDE ASSEMBLY OKAY. AND THEN BEING A COALITION THE NETWORK OF ORGANIZATIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY TAKING ACTION AMAZON. FOR LAST YEAR THAT FISHERIES MENTION THAT LOOKS INTO THE- LOT OF. WITH THIS A COLLECTED UP LOT FROM OSHA THAT LOOK AT THE RATE THAT WAS ON THE COMPUTER THE- RIGHT IN THE WAREHOUSE INDUSTRY WELL AND IN THE- SO JUST TO DIG IN A LITTLE BIT ON SOME THE DETAILS ABOUT WHAT THE INDUSTRY LOOKS LIKE- FILL IN A LITTLE BIT. OF CONTEXT. SO WITH THE MAJOR EMPLOYER THROUGH THE MAJOR EMPLOYMENT- CATEGORIES OR JOB CLASSIFICATIONS AND WAREHOUSING. ARE JUST AFFRONT OPERATOR FOR THE DRIVERS- CALIFORNIA- SIXTY TWO THOUSAND OF THEM. AND WILL BE MEAN WAGE THIRTY SEVEN DOLLARS. THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR- LABOR. THIS BY HAND DO A LOT OF THE PACKAGING EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE- STATEWIDE AVERAGE AGE THIRTY TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY DOLLARS A YEAR. AND FACTORS IMPACT BY HAND OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND ON SO THAT'S WHAT WE SEE IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN. SIXTEEN YEARS LABOR- AND YOU KNOW GET A HUGE PERCENTAGE. OF PROBABLY CLOSE TO HALF ARGUING IN THE ENTIRE- IN THIS EMPLOYEE INCLUDES WORKERS ABOUT THE STAFFING AGENCIES IN PEOPLE. IT'S HARD TO BUT WE ESTIMATED SOMEWHERE AROUND THIRTY THIRTY FIVE. EMPLOYEE YEAH TWO FOUR UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS IT WAS ON THE DOCKING AGENCIES. THE TO YOU AS IF YOU'RE RIGHT YOU KNOW. SO THIS THIS ASIDE FROM THE ECONOMIC ROUND TABLES RESEARCH- AGAIN JUST CONTACT. THE LIVING WAGE FOR OUR REGION IS- THIRTY FOR TO FOR THEM TO WORKING WITH ALL THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR EACH OF. SO YES SEVEN FOUR THOUSAND. THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A LIVING WAGE. EXAMINING THE COUNTY. IT'S NOT WE SEE MORE AND YOU LA OR THE BAY AREA STILL. REALLY HIGH AND RISING VERY QUICKLY. IN AGAIN GOOD ACTORS WHICH IS THAT WE SAW. ON THE PREVIOUS PAGE. THAT WAS IT'S NOT THE WAYS THAT WE SAW THERE DO NOT MATCH UP AND THAT'S THE WAY. AS WE SAID THAT WE DO A LOT OF THE WORKERS OF HAVING TO DEPEND ON STATE SUBSIDIES AND ON PUBLIC BENEFITS AGAIN THERE'S NOTHING SHAMEFUL ABOUT RECEIVING BENEFITS SWITCHING FOR THE PLAYERS THAT REFUSE TO PROVIDE- A LIVING WAGE AND BENEFITS TO THEIR WORKERS. THEY KNOW WHO THE BENEFIT FROM. SO YOU KNOW THE AVERAGE FOR EVERY DOLLAR WE JUST FOR MEMBERS ON WORKERS YOU SEE TWENTY FOUR CENTS. FROM PUBLIC BENEFITS TO PAY FOR THE. FOR A SECOND YOU EMPHASIZE WHILE WORKING ON AMAZON. AMAZON IS NOW THE BIGGEST PRIVATE EMPLOYER IN THE INLAND EMPIRE- WELL OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND WORKERS IN THE REGION. TEN YEARS AGO THERE WEREN'T ANY AMAZON WAREHOUSE ISSUE AT ALL RIGHT THE FIRST ONE OF THESE NUMBER. ELEVEN IT'S A LESS THAN A DECADE YOUR RISEN UP TO BECOME THE LARGEST IN ALSO WITHOUT GOING IN OUR AREA NOW THE SECOND LARGEST EMPLOYER. COUNTRY IN ABOUT THE- FOURTEEN MAJOR AS IN THE AREA- EACH OF WHICH WAS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ONE AND FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE IN OUR FOCUS IS THE FACT THAT THEY ARE DOMINANT PLAYER BUT THEY'RE ALSO THE FIRST MOVE THEY'RE THE ONES WHO WOULD MEAN A LOT OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES. I WOULD. MANAGEMENT STANDARDS- THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ARE REALLY. TRYING THREE THAT RIGHT THE JUST IN TIME TO OUR DELIVERY. PACKAGE THAT YOU RECEIVE. EASY COME SO FAST IS RELATED RELATED DIRECTLY TO THE CASE OF WORKING AROUND THE BASE OF THE DELIVERY GUY YOU HAVE. TO A DAY CORRELATED AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE SOURCES OF THAT. BUT A LITTLE BIT TO THIS ISSUE OF TURNOVER WHICH CAME OUT IN THIS REPORT. THANK YOU YOU KNOW THE COPY. RIGHT NOW- THE TURNOVER RATE IN SAN MARINO RIVERSIDE COUNTIES IN WAREHOUSING. ARE NOW CLOSE TO OR OVER A HUNDRED PERCENT. PER YEAR. SO PEOPLE ARE STAYING FOR MORE THAN A YEAR- IN WHAT WE SEE THIS IS FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN. BUT THIS IS RAPIDLY INCREASING SO WAREHOUSE INDUSTRY- IF YOU LOOK AT THE BOTTOM IT SAYS EIGHTY TWO PERCENT. TURNOVER RATE. CALIFORNIA IN THE WAREHOUSE INDUSTRY. PRIVATE INDUSTRY IT'S JUST UNDER SEVENTY. SO THAT THE TURNOVER RATE IS ALREADY HIRED IN THE WAREHOUSES. AND THEN WE'LL SEE THIS CHART SHOWS THE INCREASE AS AMAZON'S BECOME THE DOMINANT PLAYER IN WAREHOUSES AND THE BIGGEST PRIVATE EMPLOYER REGION ESPECIALLY WAREHOUSING. THE TURNOVER RATE. SO WHAT WE SAW WAS AROUND TWO THOUSAND NINE. ELEVEN BEFORE. IN THIS REGION THE TURNOVER RATE THESE WAREHOUSES WAS 6065% IN THE LAST FEW YEARS SINCE THEN IT'S GONE UP TO CLOSE TO HOME. THE EMAIL SUPPORT ACTUALLY DONE A COUPLE OF COUNTIES- OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY WHERE THERE'S ONLY AN AMAZON WAREHOUSE SO WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE TURNOVER RATE IS THERE. 192% SO EVERY SIX MONTHS THE- WHY IS THAT THEY PAY FIFTY DOLLARS AN HOUR RIGHT WILL THE BENEFITS WILL BE CLICK OVER BETTER THAN WHAT THE YOU KNOW THE AVERAGE MINIMUM WAGE JOB IS. BECAUSE OF THE CASE BECAUSE OF THE RATE BECAUSE OF THE INJURY RATES- PEOPLE FROM OTHER VERY VERY QUICKLY SO IT'S NOT WRITING A STABLE. SOURCE OF JOBS. DESPITE ALL NO. AND THEN. THE INJURY SIDE THE OTHER SIDE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE HAVE HIGH YOU KNOW HIGH TURNOVER HIGH RATES OF WORK- ON THE INJURY RATED AMAZON AGAIN THIS IS FROM THE PACKAGING. A LOT OF. TV RATINGS ON THREE TIMES NATIONALLY- BUT- SO AND IT'S WELL OVER TWICE AS MUCH AS IT IS FOR THE AVERAGE WAREHOUSE SO WHERE HOUSING IS ALREADY DEFINED BY CAL OSHA AND THE HIGH HAZARD INDUSTRY. AND YOU KNOW THEN ANIMALS ON THEIR LIVE SHOW THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY HAVE ONE. I REALLY ENJOY THE- SO. YOU CAN. THAT ALRIGHT BACK TO WORK. THE WORKERS ARE MOVING VERY. KEEP UP ON THE NOT DOING. SO THESE INJURIES ARE SPRAINS STRAINS AND CHAIRS WHICH AGAIN INDICATES OR CONTUSIONS INDICATES THAT COMES FROM MOVING VERY QUICKLY NOT NECESSARILY. WHAT THE REALLY STUFF RELATED TO TWO MACHINES IT'S A FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE JUST. SO OUR ANALYSIS IS THAT THERE NEED TO BE- STRESS ON THE WORKING TOGETHER TO TAKE ACTION TO IMPROVE THEIR CONDITIONS BUT ALSO. POLICY FROM YOUR- THANK YOU SO MUCH. FINAL. EVERYBODY. THANK YOU ALL FOR NOT ONLY THE PANELISTS BUT THE ELECTED LEADERSHIP TO BRING AWARENESS THAT I'VE- PERSONALLY FOUGHT FOR TWENTY YEARS. THANK YOU. SO. NINETEEN NINETY. I WAS A WAREHOUSE. TWO CASES. I MADE MORE MONEY STARTING OUT EIGHTEEN. START THIRTY YEARS LATER THAT. SHOP I DON'T EITHER I DON'T A LOT OF THAT STUFF. THAT AS A WAREHOUSE I STILL SEE MYSELF AS A WAREHOUSE. MAKE MY WAY ABOUT. I JUST I DON'T KNOW HOW I MEAN I CAN SEE OR TELL YOU WHY I THINK IT'S OUT OF THE HOUSE IN. THE REALITY OF. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF WORKERS IN THIS REGION. SITUATION GOT A- PAY ATTENTION WE PUT THAT IN CONTEXT IN NINETEEN NINETY. I WAS SOMETHING THIRTY YEARS LATER THAT'S NOT TAKING PLACE ANOTHER DOLLAR WHAT I WAS MAKING NINETEEN NINETIES MORE THAN WHAT THEY WERE. MY STARTING WAGES. THIS MORNING WITH THE START.

BUT THE REALITY IS A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU THOSE JOBS AS WELL THEY'RE JUST. GOING TO BE THE- SHORT TERM THE REALITY IS THERE AT THAT LOCATION. IN A MOVING TO ANOTHER LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION. AND THEY'RE SPENDING YEARS IF NOT DECADES A MOVIE JOB A JOB THAT IS DEFINITELY A STRUGGLE OF WORKERS AND THE STRUGGLE FOR THE ORDER. IS IF THE- IF EVERYBODY'S MOVING AROUND LIKE THEY ARE BY DESIGN MY- BY DESIGN BY THE DEVELOP. I FOR SYSTEMS BEEN DEVELOP VERY HARD STICK TO THEIR POINT THEY CAN ACTUALLY FIND SOME ONLINE ORGANIZER.

LA THE ME IN THE ALL THE- OTHER. ALL THE WAS TO BE ON THE SAME PAGE. AS A REALITY YOU KEY HE- BILL. BUILDINGS IN EVEN IF THEY DON'T DEAL MAKING THE- UNION FOREST'S WITH THE BUILDING. YOU'RE LEFT WITH HUNTER OF THOUSANDS OF. IN ON FIGHTING OF. RESOURCE. BY BACK IN THE WEEK AND BY BUILDING SPEC BUILDING AND DOING THE THINGS ARE GOING ON IN THIS INDUSTRY. AND NOT HOLDING IN TEN IS GOING TO BE IN THE IN PALATABLE. WHAT THE JOB LOOKS LIKE WITH CITY OR REGION THAT'S WHAT REALLY BAD. AND WHAT WE'RE ASKING I GOT. ALL KINDS OF CRAZY IDEAS OF WHAT. CALL RIGHT. LIVING IN THESE LIVING LIVE LIVE LIVE IN. THE WORKERS WERE ALSO A LOT. HELP THE STORE I COULD TELL. BECAUSE THE CREDIBLE THIS IS WHAT I THE WORKING AND IT'S GETTING WORSE IT'S NOT GETTING BETTER IT'S ACTUALLY GOING THE OTHER WAY AND IN AND WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING REALLY BEEN AGREEMENT. THREE BENEFIT WE NEED AND IF THERE'S A POLICY ORDERS. BENEFIT ME IN MANY BENEFITS. AND EVERYBODY HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE SO. SORRY MY BAD YEAH YOU GOT SO EXCITED THE ALL OF YOU WERE HERE- SO TALK ABOUT QVC. BRIEFLY THIS SHOWS THAT HOW MUCH MONEY WE- BACK TO THIS LARGE EMPLOYER WHAT'S HAPPENING IN AMERICA YOU HAVE. A LITTLE GO TO VICTORIA CLARKE SEE IF TAX ONE OF THE VERY BOTTOM. YOU'LL 9% TAX WILL REALIZE HALF THAT MONEY GOING BACK SOMEONE ELSE SOME SEXY GOING TO THE DEL. WOULD TO BASS PRO SHOP IT'S NOT ACTUALLY GOING TO THE CITY IS NOT GOING TO THE STATE. MOBILE FOR GOING ON. AND THEN THERE'S NOT A LOT OF JOBS. PLACE WE SEE IT FEELS LIKE THE SHOULD BE GOOD POLICY LAID OUT. IT IS A CV MAYBE BENEFITTED RE CHANGES GO TO WHO SAID THAT THE TABLE. CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ARE DEVELOPER TALKING. MAY THEY'LL WORK IT OUT ALL. NOW WE PROGRAMS LABOR AND EVERYONE ELSE. HOPING WE CAN CONVINCE THE CITY. I THINK HOPING SO ON THE- SIDE WITH THE V. EIGHT WHAT THAT DOES IS IT JUST KIND OF WHICH IS EVERYBODY THIS IS ABLE FIND THE RIGHT OF MY MIND. I THINK WITH THE CPA ALL OF A NEIGHBORHOODS BE A LOT BETTER JOB TO BE A LOT BETTER EVERYBODY'S GOT A. IN THE- CITY'S. AND EVERYONE. START START MOVING ELECTION THIS YEAH A LOT BETTER DEVELOP. I TALKED TO DOING. THERE WERE NO REPORTS OF REALLY TRY TAKE THE HIGH ROAD GALLIMORE MORE MORE THAN THIS AMOUNT. RESIDENTS REALLY APPRECIATE IT DONALD TRUMP. BEHIND US ON THAT AS WELL BEEN ON. SHOT ON YALL RESIDENTS WE CAN HANDLE NEIGHBORHOODS AND AMAZING IF THEY'RE NOT GOING. THE SOME OF THE OWNERS. SOME OF LOS. I'VE BEEN HEARING CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS. SAY THAT THEY KNOW THAT. THEY KIND OF GOTTEN AWAY WITH THAT LAST YEAR. THEY HAVEN'T DONE. AND I THINK IT'S TIME WE ALL SIT DOWN. LEAD UP TO THE QUESTION WHAT. VERY VERY SPECIFICALLY MAYBE A ONE HERE TO THERE WHAT OTHER THINGS LEGISLATURE CAN DO VERY. VERY GOOD. THIS SITE THIS IS THE NEXT SESSION ACTUALLY START TO IMPACT THE ISSUES OF. BUT I SAFETY AND HOW TECHNOLOGIES BEING USED IN THIS CASE. IT SEEMS LIKE TO. INCREASE THE NUMBER OF INJURIES RATHER THAN. SO I DIDN'T JUMP IN BUT- JUST WANT TO PUT THAT OUT THERE IN TERMS OF SPECIFIC LEGISLATION OUR IDEAS ARE FALSE IDEAS THAT YOU THINK WOULD ACTUALLY BE A BACK TO THE NOT JUST WITH. FIRST OF ALL I WILL SAY. THIS IS LIKE WE ARE JUST AT THE FRONT EDGE OF. RIGHT AS I THE ONE THING WE NEED IS GATHERING. OF FOLKS LIKE THIS- TO HASH OUT WHAT IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY FOR. THAT SAID I THINK- IT IS CAL OSHA. RESPONSIBILITIES TO BE TRACKING THESE AND SO THE MORE THAT CAL OSHA CAN GET INVOLVED IN THIS THAT. THAT THE TRACKING OF INJURY RATES AND THEN TRIGGER INVEST IN THE PARTICULAR FACILITIES. AND THEN YOU ANALYZE THE PATTERNS ACROSS THOSE FACILITIES AND START GETTING AT THE ROOT CAUSES. OF INJURY RATES- AND START TO DEVELOP AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FROM THERE I WOULD SAY I JUST WANT TO ADD ONE OTHER THING I ALWAYS WANT TO TRADE THE ATTENTION NOT ONLY ON THE PHYSICAL. HEALTH AND SAFETY BUT MENTAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WE KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE AND I THINK THE LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES OF THIS ARE GOING TO BE BORNE BY THE- FIRST AND FOREMOST BY THE INLAND EMPIRE. I'M SO I THINK STARTING TO DEVELOP WAYS OF TRACKING THAT VERY NEW- BUT STARTING TO. FORCE FORCE- CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY PUT. THANK YOU. THE OTHER ABOUT MORE TO BE DONE IN THE SHORT TERM TO BE. DESTRUCTIVE DRESS. YEAH I THINK- INVESTIGATION OF INJURY RATES AND ALSO YOU KNOW WHAT WHERE THESE CASES OF- WITH THESE WITH THESE RATES OF OPERATION PRODUCTION OR COMING FROM AND WHY YOU KNOW WHY THEY SAID IT IS OUR STANDARD THAT STORY'S WORKERS AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING FOUR BOXES PER MINUTE BEFORE AND THEN ONE DAY THEY JUST TOLD US SIX. AND THEY DIDN'T TELL US WHY AND IT'S NOT ARBITRARY THERE'S DEFINITELY RESEARCH HAPPENING AROUND WHY THEY'RE DOING THIS IN THERE SAYING THIS IS HOW FAST WE CAN MOVE PEOPLE- IN CERTAIN IN AMAZON THEY HAVE SOMETHING CALLED THE POWER OUR FOR THE BASE TO TAKE AN HOUR THEY SAY WHOEVER MOVES THE FASTEST THIS HOUR YOU GET A FIVE DOLLAR GIFT CARD THE PEOPLE THIS RUSH JUST AS FAST AS THEY CAN TO YEAH THERE I GOT BORED OF DO IT OKAY ALWAYS GOES OUT SO I CAN. ANY BASE A TRYING TO HELP THEY CAN MOVE THE AND HOW FAST THEY CAN PUSH PEOPLE I THINK THAT'S POINT ABOUT PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT AS WELL ON WE HAD WORKERS TO COME TO SAY WHAT'S THE BIG ISSUE HERE LOOK WORRIED ABOUT ACTED. UPON WAS THAT. WE'RE SO STRESSED OUT PEOPLE FREAK OUT BUG OUT IN WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING HAPPEN IN WITH NO WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF FISHING ROOM HEALTH VERY COMPLICATED WE THINK THAT THIS IS PUSHING PEOPLE ALL THESE DIFFERENT WAYS. SO WE THAT THERE TO BE KIND OF COPPER IN ELSE BUT I AGAIN WHAT WE SEE ENOUGH FROM THE RESEARCH AND FROM WORKERS AND STUFF IS PLACE OF WORK IS SOMETHING THAT THE YOU KNOW THE KELLERS SHE'S WORKING ON SKINNER YOU KNOW GOT IT FOR. FIFTEEN YEARS NOW THERE HAS TO BE IN A PLAN TO REBUILD LIKE WHAT IS THIS NEW WHERE WERE THESE YEAH. I WOULD ALSO AGREE THAT. THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE MONITORING OF WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND AND- YOU KNOW THERE'S- LABOR LAW VIOLATIONS IF YOU KNOW HAVE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY. VIOLATIONS BUT ALSO IN. WE HEAR REPORTS TO ABOUT EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION IS. ABOUT YOU KNOW INSUFFICIENT WORK BREAKS AS WELL WHICH I THINK IS ALSO RELATED TO. TO SOME OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF. ISSUES THAT. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER- YOU KNOW THAT THE SIZE OF THESE FACILITIES IS ENORMOUS RIGHT SO GETTING TO THE BREAK ROOM. AND THE RESTROOMS- ON TOP OF THE FACT THAT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH. THE SECURITY AND THAT TAKES A LONG TIME TO GET THROUGH THE SECURITY TO GET TO THE BREAK ROOM. RIGHT AND YEAH IT TAKES A TOLL. PHYSICALLY AND IN TERMS OF THE MENTAL HEALTH AS WELL THE JUST THE STRESS LEVELS- I THINK WHATEVER THE STATE CAN DO TO. TO KIND OF HELP LOW THEY OWN YOU KNOW THE- RATES WHICH ARE JUST. AND REASONABLE RATES AND- PHYSICALLY THESE ARE JUST. TOO HIGH RIGHT AND YOU KNOW WHAT. HI I'M NOT SURE THE EXACT NECK. THAT YOU KNOW BUT I JUST THINK THAT. THERE NEEDS TO BE SET MORE WORK FOR PROTECTION I PERSONALLY. FEEL LIKE THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE PROTECTION FOR THE WORKERS ON THE GROUND THESE RATES ARE JUST AND REASONABLE. NOT JUST THAT. MAKING RATE BUT ALSO BEING SURVEILLED ABOUT HOW MUCH TIME OFF TASK EXACTLY YOU KNOW. WHICH YOU KNOW. LEADS TO THINGS LIKE IT'S LIKE PEOPLE NOT BE ABLE TO USE THE FACT THAT I MEAN THAT'S A HUMAN NEED AT THAT PEOPLE HAVE RIGHT AND IT WAS ON- HAS- WOMEN WHO ARE PREGNANT. SUING AMAZON RIGHT BECAUSE IT. TO THE BATHROOM YOU KNOW WHEN THEY NEEDED TO RUN IN YOU KNOW IT'S A- PREGNANCY DISCRIMINATION RIGHT SO I THINK YOU KNOW. THERE'S ALL SORTS OF THE LABOR LAW VIOLATIONS- THAT THAT REALLY NEED TO ATTENTION. SO THERE. TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST THERE'S NO. WITH THE ANSWER- YOU KNOW I. WHERE ELSE PERSON MYSELF AND ACTUALLY NEGOTIATING THESE ITEMS EVERY EVERY ISSUE THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP HERE UNDER COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT IS ACTUALLY THE BUDGET. WE WORK THROUGH RIGHT TO WORK THROUGH THE SAFETY ISSUE WORK THROUGH THE ORGAN ON. CERTAIN THINGS WE GO I THINK THAT WHAT YOU COULD DO WHAT COULD BE DONE IS TO SIT DOWN WITH LABOR EXCLUSIVELY AND TRY TO IDENTIFY THE ISSUE BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT'S A MATTER OF GIVEN THESE INDIVIDUALS QUICKER ACCESS TO THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. QUICKER ACCESS TO THEM TO BUILD ORGANIZE. THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN BUILT IN THE WIG TO MAKE IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO HAVE THAT LAYS ON THE JOB. AND THEN OSHA ALL OF ENTITIES ARE OVER RUN. WITH ALL OF THE COMPLAINTS AND EVERYTHING'S GOING ON EVERYWHERE. THEY DON'T HAVE BY THE TIME THEY GET TO INVESTIGATING SOMETHING. SOMEBODY SO THERE AYE SHE MOVED ONTO ANOTHER. SO SHORT TERM LABOR DOWN IN THE SCHOOLS OF THE- I NEVER READ MOTHER. ON THEIR ROB. THOSE OPERATE INSIDE THE WAREHOUSES TYPES OF WATCHING. SECOND WOULD BE LOOKING HOW WITH THE HAPPENS AFTER. I WOULD I WOULD I WOULD OUT HER WITH THAT- YOU KNOW THAT FROM THE WORKERS ARE WE TALKED TO YOU KNOW THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT JUST HOW HOSTILE VERY WE'RE HOUSE OF BLUES ON TO USE YOU KNOW IT JUST SIMPLY RETALIATION RIGHT ANOTHER LABOR LAW VIOLATIONS. SOMETHING THAT NEEDS. WE NEED WE NEED MORE. ONE OF THE THINGS. YOU KNOW. SOME REAL. HI MY. BUT I THINK AND THEN AS- DATA- ON THE- REQUEST INFORMATION ABOUT THE DATA THAT'S BEING COLLECTED ON THEM- HOW THAT HOW THAT CAN APPLY TO WAREHOUSES I THINK IS THAT- AND ONE OF THE BIG- CHANGES THAT TECHNOLOGIES TO PRODUCE IS IT IS FURTHER INFORMATION ASYMMETRY SO EMPLOYERS ARE COLLECTING MORE DATA ON THEIR WORKERS WHICH GIVES THEM MORE POWER IN THAT RELATIONSHIP IT'S AS MUCH AS WE CAN. START TO KIND OF REVIEW- BUT SOME OF THAT DATA IS I THINK WE CAN. GET BACK TO LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD A LITTLE BIT MORE BETWEEN WORKERS AND- THANK YOU I KNOW WILL BE FOLLOWING UP WITH ALL OF YOUR YOUR SUGGESTIONS AND EVEN MORE SUGGESTIONS I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE. ALL YOUR BILLION MINDS AS THE NUMBERS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS YOU HAVE. SO AS A REPRESENTATIVE RIGHT HERE IN RIVERSIDE THIS ISSUE IS VERY PERSONAL TO- I HAVE IN MY OFFICE HERE IN RIVERSIDE CLIMATE WELL. GOVERNMENT LEVELS- WENT TO POLY HIGH SCHOOL HER MOTHER ENVIRONMENT WORK IN THE WAREHOUSE. CARMEN PERSONALLY HAS THE STORIES OF HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS TO WORK IN THE WAREHOUSES IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. I I'VE BEEN SERVING SEVEN YEARS NOW IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE BUT BEFORE I WAS ELECTED- ANOTHER STUDENT OF MINE PROBABLY HIGH SCHOOL ANGEL ARIZA. FROM CASABLANCA. WORK WITH THE- WAREHOUSE WORKER RESOURCE CENTER AND ANGEL BEFORE GOING ON TO PRINCETON UNIVERSITY WORKED THAT SUMMER AS I AND I FORGET THE TERM GOING IN- YOU KNOW JUST APPLYING FOR JOBS. BUT WELL THERE'S A TERM THE LABOR HAS. SALTY ANGEL ARIZA WORK DOING THAT IN THE WAREHOUSE AND HE WAS ABLE TO GET LOTS OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE CONDITION OF THE OF THE WAREHOUSES AND THIS WAS AS I SAY PROBABLY EIGHT NINE YEARS AGO ANGEL WENT ON TO GRADUATE FROM PRINCETON UNIVERSITY. STUDY RECENTLY CAME OUT FORGET THE NAME OF THE GROUP THAT DID THE STUDY. BUT IT LOOKED AT YOUNG PEOPLE GROWING UP IN THE UNITED STATES. AND IN THAT STUDY CAME OUT THE LAST FEW WEEKS IDENTIFIED BAKERSFIELD. YEAH MY APOLOGIES TO MY COLLEAGUE RUDY SALAS AS THE WORST PLACE TO GROW UP AS A YOUNG PERSON. AS A CHILD. RIGHT BEHIND BAKERSFIELD WAS THE INLAND EMPIRE. RIVERSIDE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE WAS RATED NUMBER FIVE. WORST PLACE TO GROW UP AS A YOUNG PERSON PART OF THAT IS WAGES CLIMATE. IN ERROR CONDITIONS- IN THE AREA. AS WE HEAR SIT HERE AND LISTEN TO THE CONDITIONS IN THE WAREHOUSES I AM REMINDED OF THE EFFORT THE FARM WORKERS HAD TO GO. THE EFFORTS THE FARMWORKERS ANOTHER LATINO WORK. HAD TO GO THROUGH TO GET RECOGNIZED TALK ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO USE THE BACK. I REMEMBER IN THE FIELD WHEN THERE WERE NO ABOUT. YOU KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT HAVING THE RATE. OF HAVING TO WORK FASTER AND FASTER. FIREMAN TELLS ME STORIES ABOUT BEING INTIMIDATED TO HAVE TO DO OVERTIME. COMMENT ON SUNDAY. SO I DO HAVE A QUESTION. BECAUSE. HAVING LIVED HERE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE BY THE LONG TIME I REMEMBER AS YOU SPEAK. TIES ARE STILL BY THE UNION JOB. AND PENSIONS HIGH PAYING JOB SO MY QUESTION- WHAT ARE. YOU KNOW I KNOW THE EFFORTS OF BEEN GOING ON FOR AWHILE. TO USE. AND I APPLAUD THOSE UP. WHAT IS IT THAT WE CAN DO AS LEGISLATORS SITTING UP HERE AS A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THIS AREA IN SACRAMENTO WHAT IS IT THAT WE CAN DO RIGHT TO ADDRESS. THE DIFFICULTY IN BEING ABLE TO USE. WHAT IS THERE ANYTHING SPECIFIC. READ THAT WE CAN DO IS I WOULD BE HAPPY TO INTRODUCE SUCH LEGISLATION. KIND OF ASSUMING THAT AT MY DIRECTION RIGHT. YOU KNOW I'D SAY TAKE A POLL OF APPROACH I'D SAY YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED IN THE RECENT PAST. IS IT. CLAIMS TO BE PREEMPTED BY THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT. I THINK THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE COULD TAKE SOME VERY BOLD. STEP RECOGNITION PROCESS FOR WORKERS. WE CAN IMPORT. PROCESSES FOR WORKERS TO BE ABLE TO ORGANIZE ON A MUCH FASTER PACE. BY GOING TO CITY GOVERNMENT AND ACTUALLY HAVING. THE STATE LEVEL ITSELF FOR SOME SORT OF SYSTEM THAT MOVES OUT ALONG MUCH FASTER I. ABSOLUTELY REMEMBER KAISER STEEL I WAS. FONTANA I WAS DELIVERY PAPERS YEARS OLD LONG SHUTTING DOWN. THE SHUTDOWN OF THAT STILL MILL AND AT THE TIME WE GAVE UP I THINK THAT THE TIME IN THE SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES OR WHAT MUCH UNDERSTANDING FIREMAN AND HOW THE LONG TERM IMPACT. PEOPLE WHO GAVE UP. WHAT HAPPENED. BYRON POLICE GOOD JOB RIGHT THERE'S A TRADE OFF BUT NOW WE KNOW TODAY WE GOT TO BE SMART ABOUT FOR. FORTUNATELY NOW THE OPPOSITE HAPPENED THERE'S NOT GOOD JOB. AND ON TOP OF IT WE HAVE TO BUY OR MENTAL. SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE A DOUBLE IF NOT A TRIPLE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ISSUE. SO MY ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS FOR PEOPLE. TO BE MORE AGGRESSIVE THE ALLOWING PROCESSES. IN OTHER WORDS COMMUNITY BENEFITS AGREEMENT. FOR SOME SYSTEM AT THE STATE LEVEL. WHICH IS A SON OF VICE CITY'S. FOR THEM TO INVOICE COMMUNITY BENEFITS AGREEMENT- YOU COULD ONE HAVE PENALTIES. THAT PREVENT- LET'S SAY IT. THE DEVELOPER COMES AND GET SOME SORT OF INFRASTRUCTURE- CREDIT EIGHT MINUTES WHATEVER IT MAY BE TO CALL A MILLION DIFFERENT THINGS NOW RIGHT. ON THE MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE SYSTEM. THAT THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED. TO USE UNION ABSOLUTELY NOT WHILE YOU'RE GETTING CREDIT FROM SOME GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY SOME LEVEL. HOW IS IT THAT THEY- WILL GOING TO ORGANIZE. A SENSE OF USING THAT SAME. FOR UNION OF WHITE SO IT'S GOOD ANNA. SAMPLE AMAZON THE PAY IN. RIGHT NOW THOUGH. EMPLOYER IN EMPIRE THE TURNOVER RATE. IS LIKE ONE OF THE SOUL STUDY ON 3% WE HAD A PERCENT ONE YEAR OF FACILITY. OF OVER A THOUSAND PEOPLE HOW YOU EVEN GET THROUGH THAT PROCESS. NOW WHAT YOU DO IS YOU GET THE LOCAL ELECTED TO START SAYING HEY WE'RE GONNA CHANGE THE RULES. IN HOW YOU ARE AN EMPLOYER IN MY CITY. I THINK THAT WHAT THE STATE TO DO IS ACTUALLY. PUT SOMETHING IN PLACE. SENATE OR PENALTY I KNOW YOU RATHER DO A CHARACTER IN THE STATE. GOT TO BE REALISTIC. I'VE GOT LIKE. ONE THIRTY IDEAS YOU WANT TO SIT DOWN AND THAT. ALSO LIKE TO HEAR FROM. I THINK YEAH MOSTLY WHAT. THAT IS. BECAUSE OF THE WE ALL THE CITY'S SUBSIDIZE. YEAH THE OTHER ONE COUNTY. SO YOU GOT. WE HAVE A ONE OF THE YEAH THAT'S- DOES HAVE GENERAL FOR. TO STABILIZE. TO BE ABLE TO. THE TURNOVER RATE MAKES IT HARDER FOR. TO BE ABLE TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER. JOINT. THE BREAK. THANK YOU FOR BEING ELECTED THREE YEARS AGO I. I REPRESENTED A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE. AND IT WAS A LONG. ALL WORK. MORE YOU. SO WE'RE HEALTH WORKERS ARE BEING INJURED IT ALMOST DOESN'T MATTER I WOULD HAVE YOU TALKED ABOUT A REPORT THE AMAZONS DISPOSABLE WORKERS TWENTY TWENTY THAT'S SAYS IT ALL. WHEN YOU DON'T CARE WHAT'S HAPPENING TO YOUR WORKERS THEN EVERYTHING ELSE EVER EVER. BOTTOM LINE IS ALL THAT MATTERS- IN THAT IS OF GREAT CONCERN I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THE BILL THAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER MEDINA INTRODUCED WE SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. CALLS FOR THOSE STUDIES AND THE ONCE WE HAVE THOSE STUDIES WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO SO MUCH MORE WITH THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE HARD FACTS. WE HAVE A LOT OF IT FROM WHAT YOU WERE PROVIDED TO US. AND WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE ARE ARE FARMWORKERS THAT. WILL PICKING ONIONS ARE GREAT AND VERY PROUD OF THAT WORK. WITH THE FARM WORKERS WORKED REALLY HARD TO GET RID OF THE SHORT HANDLED. HOE AND THAT WAS. FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE FORMER OWNERS- BUT IT TOOK A LONG TIME WAS FINALLY. DONE I THINK WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THE SAME THING YOU HAVE WITH THE CHAIR OF. THE LABOR COMMITTEE FOR THE ASSEMBLY. LEADING THIS AND LISTENING TO THIS TESTIMONY HE'S BEEN A GREAT ADVOCATE FOR WORKERS AND I KNOW THAT BETWEEN THE THREE OF US WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH SOME LEGISLATION. SO YOU'VE TOLD US SOME OF IT NOW. REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU THAT IF YOU THINK OF OTHER IDEAS. THAT YOU LET US KNOW- INDIVIDUALLY OR THROUGH THROUGH THE CHAIR. LET US KNOW ABOUT YOUR SUGGESTIONS. BECAUSE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ACTUALLY NEED TO. DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE CAL OSHA PART. I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN START MOVING ON. YOU DO BENEFIT AGREEMENT. I THINK WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO KEEP THOSE. THANK YOU SO MUCH- IT IS TOUGH TO TELL YOU SAID THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING JUST STARTING TO HAVE IN DEPTH CONVERSATIONS EVEN THOUGH I KNOW MANY OF YOU WORK MANY YEARS. ADDING TO THE POINT WHERE IT IS REALLY GETTING PUBLIC. PUBLIC PERCEPTION IS CHANGING AND CERTAIN THE LEGISLATURE'S WHILE SO.
