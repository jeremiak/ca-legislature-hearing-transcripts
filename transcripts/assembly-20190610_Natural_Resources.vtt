WEBVTT

00:29:58.329 --> 00:29:59.597
PERIOD OF FIFTY YEARS FROM THE

00:29:59.664 --> 00:30:01.900
AQUIFER UNDER THAT MOJAVE DESERT.

00:30:01.966 --> 00:30:03.001
AND SELL IT TO VARIOUS WATER

00:30:03.067 --> 00:30:05.803
DISTRICTS IN OTHER PARTS OF OF

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:07.539
THE STATE FOR PURPOSES OF

00:30:07.605 --> 00:30:11.009
GUARANTEEING WATER TO ABOUT A

00:30:11.075 --> 00:30:13.044
HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW HOMES AND

00:30:13.111 --> 00:30:13.811
SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:30:13.878 --> 00:30:14.646
RESIDENTS.

00:30:14.712 --> 00:30:16.381
THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT THE

00:30:16.447 --> 00:30:18.249
SCIENCES IN CONFLICT AS TO WHAT

00:30:18.316 --> 00:30:19.884
AN ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE

00:30:19.951 --> 00:30:22.921
LEVEL OF PUMPING ACTUALLY IS.

00:30:22.987 --> 00:30:24.923
AND IF COULD EASE -- AND ITS

00:30:24.989 --> 00:30:27.458
SCIENTISTS HAPPEN TO BE WRONG

00:30:27.525 --> 00:30:27.759
[inaudible]

00:30:27.825 --> 00:30:30.195
THE PUMPING COULD POTENTIALLY

00:30:30.261 --> 00:30:31.763
DESTROY THE MOJAVE DESERT AND

00:30:31.829 --> 00:30:33.398
CERTAINLY IMPAIR THE WATER

00:30:33.464 --> 00:30:36.634
SUPPLY TO THOSE -- NEW HOMES.

00:30:36.701 --> 00:30:38.002
KNOW WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND IT

00:30:38.069 --> 00:30:39.437
IT ONLY DOES THIS.

00:30:39.504 --> 00:30:41.539
IS THAT SEEKS TO HIT THE PAUSE

00:30:41.606 --> 00:30:43.808
BUTTON ON THIS PROJECT.

00:30:43.875 --> 00:30:45.410
IN THIS VERY VOTE OF VERY

00:30:45.476 --> 00:30:46.978
FRAGILE ECOSYSTEM.

00:30:47.045 --> 00:30:48.546
AND HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON TO

00:30:48.613 --> 00:30:50.114
ENSURE THAT E GET THE SCIENCE

00:30:50.181 --> 00:30:52.050
RIGHT [inaudible]

00:30:52.116 --> 00:30:56.020
NOW THE PROJECT HAS BEEN STALLED.

00:30:56.087 --> 00:30:57.689
FOR MANY YEARS FRANKLY BECAUSE

00:30:57.755 --> 00:31:00.425
THE MASS SIMPLY DOESN'T ADD UP.

00:31:00.491 --> 00:31:01.426
COULD IS WANTS TO PULL AS I

00:31:01.492 --> 00:31:02.961
INDICATED FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE

00:31:03.027 --> 00:31:04.329
FEET OF WATER PER YEAR OUT OF

00:31:04.395 --> 00:31:05.263
THE AQUIFER.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:07.131
BUT ADMITS THAT THE AQUIFER ONLY

00:31:07.198 --> 00:31:09.867
RECHARGES AT THE RATE OF ABOUT

00:31:09.934 --> 00:31:10.468
THIRTY TWO THOUSAND ACRE FEET

00:31:10.535 --> 00:31:10.902
PER YEAR.

00:31:10.969 --> 00:31:13.338
THAT'S A DIFFERENCE OF EIGHTEEN

00:31:13.404 --> 00:31:15.607
THOUSAND ACRE FEET AND ALMOST

00:31:15.673 --> 00:31:17.275
SIX BILLION GALLONS OF WATER.

00:31:17.342 --> 00:31:19.777
NOW -- SCIENTISTS WORKING FOR

00:31:19.844 --> 00:31:21.412
THE U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY AND

00:31:21.479 --> 00:31:23.181
THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE.

00:31:23.248 --> 00:31:25.617
INSTEAD SAY THE REFILL RAIDER

00:31:25.683 --> 00:31:28.453
RECHARGE RATE IS MORE LIKE

00:31:28.519 --> 00:31:30.321
200-021-0000 ACRE FEET PER YEAR

00:31:30.388 --> 00:31:30.622
[inaudible]

00:31:30.688 --> 00:31:31.556
SEOUL.

00:31:31.623 --> 00:31:33.625
IN SHORT IF THE US GEOLOGICAL

00:31:33.691 --> 00:31:35.326
SURVEY AND THE NATIONAL PARK

00:31:35.393 --> 00:31:36.628
SERVICE SCIENTISTS ARE CORRECT

00:31:36.694 --> 00:31:38.429
THAT'S AT LEAST FORTY THOUSAND

00:31:38.496 --> 00:31:40.131
ACRE FEET OR ABOUT FOURTEEN

00:31:40.198 --> 00:31:41.466
BILLION GALLONS.

00:31:41.532 --> 00:31:44.235
LESS THAN THE KIDDIES PLAN --

00:31:44.302 --> 00:31:46.471
CLEARLY THERE IS IN MY VIEW AND

00:31:46.537 --> 00:31:47.438
THE VIEW OF SOME OTHERS IS A

00:31:47.505 --> 00:31:48.906
SERIOUS CONFLICT IN THE

00:31:48.973 --> 00:31:50.108
SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE.

00:31:50.174 --> 00:31:51.743
SURROUNDING THIS PROJECT AND WE

00:31:51.809 --> 00:31:53.611
THINK THAT CONFLICT SHOULD BE

00:31:53.678 --> 00:31:54.412
RESOLVED BEFORE THE PUMPING

00:31:54.479 --> 00:31:55.380
STARTS.

00:31:55.446 --> 00:31:58.650
THAT'S IN ESSENCE AND IN SHORT

00:31:58.716 --> 00:32:00.752
WHAT THIS BILL DOES.

00:32:00.818 --> 00:32:01.919
SO AT THE APPROPRIATE POINT I

00:32:01.986 --> 00:32:04.589
REQUEST WILL RESPECTFULLY

00:32:04.656 --> 00:32:06.624

WORKING IN THE CALIFORNIA DESERT

00:32:25.243 --> 00:32:26.944
IN FACT WE WERE THE ORGANIZATION

00:32:27.011 --> 00:32:28.980
THAT BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY

00:32:29.047 --> 00:32:29.981
SUCCESSFULLY.

00:32:30.048 --> 00:32:32.216
WERE ABLE TO LIST THE DESERT

TORTOISE AS ENDANGERED UNDER THE

00:32:33.818 --> 00:32:35.420
FEDERAL ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT.

00:32:35.486 --> 00:32:36.387
THE KEYS VALLEY IS A VERY

00:32:36.454 --> 00:32:38.222
SPECIAL PLACE IT'S LOCATED IN

00:32:38.289 --> 00:32:40.058

SERVICE THE AQUIFER THAT THE

00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:53.538
KIDDIES CORPORATION PROPOSES TO

MINE.

00:32:54.605 --> 00:32:56.474

00:33:00.645 --> 00:33:02.513
THIS AQUIFER SUSTAINS DESERT

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:03.548
SPRINGS IN PLANTS THAT ARE

00:33:03.614 --> 00:33:04.882
CRITICAL TO ICONIC DESERT

00:33:11.356 --> 00:33:13.091
BOXES -- AS SENATOR AUTHORITY

00:33:13.157 --> 00:33:14.959
DETAILED -- THERE IS A

00:33:15.026 --> 00:33:17.428
SUBSTANTIAL DISAGREEMENT OVER

00:33:17.495 --> 00:33:20.231
HOW MUCH OF THIS A PROJECT WILL

00:33:20.298 --> 00:33:23.334
DRIVE THE AQUIFER INTO OVERDRAFT --

00:33:23.401 --> 00:33:24.936
IT PROPOSES UPON FIFTY THOUSAND

00:33:25.002 --> 00:33:26.604
ACRE FEET OF WATER OVER FIFTY

00:33:26.671 --> 00:33:28.506
YEARS THAT HE SAID THAT. SIXTEEN

00:33:28.573 --> 00:33:29.941
BILLION GALLONS OR FIVE HUNDRED

00:33:30.007 --> 00:33:31.142
AND TWENTY THREE GALLONS PER

00:33:31.209 --> 00:33:35.246
SECOND OF WATER BEING PUMPED OUT

THE AQUIFER.

00:33:36.314 --> 00:33:37.648
WE BELIEVE THAT THE SCIENCE WILL

00:33:37.715 --> 00:33:38.850
SHOW THAT THIS IS UNSUSTAINABLE --

00:33:38.916 --> 00:33:39.817
AND THAT THE RESULT OF

00:33:39.884 --> 00:33:41.419
UNSUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MINING

00:33:41.486 --> 00:33:42.987
WILL DROP THE WATER TABLE IN

00:33:43.054 --> 00:33:44.088
THIS AREA.

00:33:44.155 --> 00:33:46.657
AND DRAIN IMPORTANT SPRINGS AND

00:33:46.724 --> 00:33:49.627
IMPACT PLANTS AND THE DESERT OF

00:33:49.694 --> 00:33:50.862
RESOURCES.

00:33:50.928 --> 00:33:52.096
AND IN FACT WE ARE VERY

00:33:52.163 --> 00:33:54.198
CONCERNED BECAUSE THE IMPACTS

00:33:54.265 --> 00:33:55.433
ARE VERY SEVERE IN THIS DRY

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.935
LANDSCAPE THIS AREA GETS

00:33:58.002 --> 00:33:59.504
APPROXIMATELY TWO ONLY.

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:00.972
JUST OVER TWO AND A HALF INCHES

00:34:01.038 --> 00:34:02.740
OF RAINFALL EVERY YEAR AND WHEN

00:34:02.807 --> 00:34:03.841
YOU LOOK AT THE MODELING THE

00:34:03.908 --> 00:34:07.011
CLIMATE MODELING -- FROM THE I

00:34:07.078 --> 00:34:07.812
PC.

00:34:07.879 --> 00:34:10.181
THIS AREA WILL ONLY BECOME DRIER

00:34:10.248 --> 00:34:13.084
AND HOTTER -- SO THE LEGISLATURE

00:34:13.151 --> 00:34:14.886
HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT IN THIS

00:34:14.952 --> 00:34:16.521
ERA OF DRIVING CALIFORNIA'S

00:34:16.587 --> 00:34:17.789
AWKWARD THAT THE ERROR OF

00:34:17.855 --> 00:34:19.190
DRIVING OUR AQUIFER'S INTO

00:34:19.257 --> 00:34:21.292
OVERDRAFT IS OVER WE'VE PASSED

00:34:21.359 --> 00:34:22.960
LEGISLATION TO THAT EFFECT.

00:34:23.027 --> 00:34:24.128

CONSISTENT WITH THAT POLICY IT

00:34:29.767 --> 00:34:30.835
WOULD PROTECT OUR DESERT'S AND

OUR PUBLIC LANDS BY CREATING A

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:34.972
DEFINITIVE PROCESS FOR THE STATE.

00:34:35.039 --> 00:34:37.008

SEVEN A PARTICULAR IS NECESSARY

00:34:46.517 --> 00:34:48.386
BECAUSE WE HAD IT'S EXPECTED THE

WE'RE HERE TO EXPRESS OUR

00:40:25.923 --> 00:40:27.057
OPPOSITION TO THE BILL UNLESS

00:40:27.124 --> 00:40:29.059

THREE THINGS REAL QUICKLY FIRST

OF ALL?

00:40:44.842 --> 00:40:46.277

THINK ABOUT THE PRESIDENT THIS

00:40:53.617 --> 00:40:54.819
BILL SETS.

00:40:54.885 --> 00:40:56.954
IT SAYS THAT ANY PROJECT AS YOU

00:40:57.021 --> 00:40:58.889
TALK ABOUT WATER HOUSING IS

00:40:58.956 --> 00:41:00.457
BEING TWO OF THE PARTY ISSUES

00:41:00.524 --> 00:41:02.560
OUR STATE FACES.

00:41:02.626 --> 00:41:04.929
CAN SIMPLY BE APPROVED UNDER THE

00:41:04.995 --> 00:41:06.897
SEQUEL PROCESS WHICH WE ALL KNOW

00:41:06.964 --> 00:41:08.199
IS NOT SIMPLE.

00:41:08.265 --> 00:41:10.000
AND AFTER THAT.

00:41:10.067 --> 00:41:11.535
ODJICK THAT YOUR CONSTITUENTS

00:41:11.602 --> 00:41:12.837
SUPPORT THAT YOUR DISTRICTS

00:41:12.903 --> 00:41:14.438
SUPPORTS.

00:41:14.505 --> 00:41:16.140
CAN BE TAKEN TO THE LEGISLATURE

00:41:16.207 --> 00:41:18.309
TO SAY LET'S ADD ONE MORE LAYER

00:41:18.375 --> 00:41:20.110
OF REVIEW LET'S TRY TO SLOW DOWN

00:41:20.177 --> 00:41:22.513
OR STOP A PROJECT THAT HAS BEEN

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:23.214
TO SEE QUOTE.

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:25.216
AND THEN SUCCESSFULLY DEFENDED

00:41:25.282 --> 00:41:29.019
NO LESS THAN SIX TIMES.

00:41:29.086 --> 00:41:30.554
THAT IN ITSELF IS A DANGEROUS

00:41:30.621 --> 00:41:32.223
PRECEDENT.

00:41:32.289 --> 00:41:34.024
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT THIS

00:41:34.091 --> 00:41:35.726
BILL DOES IN TERMS OF PRECEDENT.

00:41:35.793 --> 00:41:37.995
IS FIRST OF ALL IT REQUIRES THE

00:41:38.062 --> 00:41:39.597
LANDS COMMISSION TO MAKE IT

00:41:39.663 --> 00:41:41.031
AFFIRMATIVE FINDING.

00:41:41.098 --> 00:41:43.133
THAT THE PROJECT HAS ABSOLUTELY

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:46.971
NO ADVERSE IMPACT WHATSOEVER.

00:41:47.037 --> 00:41:48.472
THERE ISN'T ONE PROJECT IN THE

00:41:48.539 --> 00:41:49.807
STATE.

00:41:49.874 --> 00:41:51.375
MUCH LESS IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:41:51.442 --> 00:41:53.978
THAT COULD BE APPROVED IT THE

00:41:54.044 --> 00:41:55.746
STANDARD WAS THAT THERE WAS

00:41:55.813 --> 00:41:58.315
ABSOLUTELY NO ADVERSE IMPACT

00:41:58.382 --> 00:41:59.850
PROJECTS HAVE BEEN TAX THAT'S

00:41:59.917 --> 00:42:01.852
WHAT MITIGATION IS ABOUT THAT'S

00:42:01.919 --> 00:42:03.153
THE WAY SEEK WAS SET UP.

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:04.788
THERE'S NO PROJECT IN THE STATE

00:42:04.855 --> 00:42:07.157
THE COULD MEET THE STANDARD

00:42:07.224 --> 00:42:08.959
CONTAINED IN THIS BILL.

00:42:09.026 --> 00:42:11.128
SECONDLY THE BILL HAS NO ABILITY

00:42:11.195 --> 00:42:12.229
FOR THE LANDS COMMISSION TO IN

00:42:12.296 --> 00:42:14.031
FACT SAY.

00:42:14.098 --> 00:42:15.566
NOR DOES IT REQUIRE THE LANDS

00:42:15.633 --> 00:42:17.568
COMMISSION TO SAY WHAT THE BASIS

00:42:17.635 --> 00:42:19.236
OF THEIR FINDING IS IF THEY IN

00:42:19.303 --> 00:42:20.871
FACT FIND THAT THERE ARE ADVERSE

00:42:20.938 --> 00:42:22.473
IMPACTS THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT

00:42:22.539 --> 00:42:24.508
UNDER THE BILL NO PROCESS SET UP

00:42:24.575 --> 00:42:25.442
UNDER THIS BILL.

00:42:25.509 --> 00:42:28.212
THAT WILL REQUIRE TRANSPARENCY

00:42:28.279 --> 00:42:30.714
FOR THEM TO IN FACT SAY WHAT WAS

00:42:30.781 --> 00:42:32.516
THE BASIS OF THOSE FINDINGS.

00:42:32.583 --> 00:42:33.550
THAT IS IN FACT WHAT IT

00:42:33.617 --> 00:42:35.252
DETERMINATION IS WHICH IS WHAT

00:42:35.319 --> 00:42:37.087
WE HAVE REQUESTED AS AMENDMENTS

00:42:37.154 --> 00:42:38.255
IN THE BILL THAT.

00:42:38.322 --> 00:42:40.057
THAT THE AGENCY BE REQUIRED TO

00:42:40.124 --> 00:42:43.227
MAKE A DETERMINATION SO THAT ITS

00:42:43.294 --> 00:42:44.662
FINDINGS CAN BE.

00:42:44.728 --> 00:42:46.597
HELD IN PUBLIC HEARINGS IN

00:42:46.664 --> 00:42:48.699
TRANSPARENCY THE SO THAT THE

00:42:48.766 --> 00:42:51.035
PUBLIC CAN IN FACT KNOW THE

00:42:51.101 --> 00:42:56.707
BASIS OF THOSE FINDINGS.

00:42:56.774 --> 00:42:58.509
IF YOU'RE GOING TO REQUIRE AN

00:42:58.575 --> 00:43:00.511
ADDITIONAL REVIEW WHICH BY THE

00:43:00.577 --> 00:43:02.479
WAY COULD EASE IS NOT OPPOSED TO

00:43:02.546 --> 00:43:04.014
AN ADDITIONAL REVIEW OF THE

00:43:04.081 --> 00:43:05.816
SCIENCE WE BELIEVE STRONGLY IN

00:43:05.883 --> 00:43:07.384
THE SCIENCE THAT IS BEHIND THIS

00:43:07.451 --> 00:43:08.385
PROJECT.

00:43:08.452 --> 00:43:10.421
AND WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO A

00:43:10.487 --> 00:43:12.923
REVIEW OF THAT SCIENCE.

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:15.025
OUR CONCERNS ARE WITH THAT

00:43:15.092 --> 00:43:18.028
REVIEW A THERE IS NO PROCESS

00:43:18.095 --> 00:43:19.863
ESTABLISHED IN THIS BILL.

00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:20.931
THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT FOR

00:43:20.998 --> 00:43:21.932
PUBLIC HEARINGS THERE'S NO

00:43:21.999 --> 00:43:23.968
REQUIREMENT FOR TRANSPARENCY AND

00:43:24.034 --> 00:43:25.869
AGAIN AS I SAID BEFORE THERE'S

00:43:25.936 --> 00:43:27.705
NO REQUIREMENT.

00:43:27.771 --> 00:43:29.707
THAT THE LANDS COMMISSION SAY IN

00:43:29.773 --> 00:43:31.642
FACT WHAT WAS THE BASIS OF THEIR

00:43:31.709 --> 00:43:33.644
SCIENTIFIC REVIEW AND FINDINGS

00:43:33.711 --> 00:43:37.548
THAT LED THEM TO MAKE THEIR FIND.

00:43:37.614 --> 00:43:39.216
THAT SEEMS TO ME.

00:43:39.283 --> 00:43:40.951
THE BASIS OF WHAT A PUBLIC

00:43:41.018 --> 00:43:42.753
REVIEW SHOULD BE AS WITH PUBLIC

00:56:44.768 --> 00:56:46.870
AFTER YOU FURTHER ANALYZE THESE

00:56:46.936 --> 00:56:48.471

THIS DISCUSSION THIS BILL IS NOW

00:56:58.815 --> 00:56:59.582
BASICALLY TO YOUR BILL WE'VE

00:56:59.649 --> 00:57:01.518
BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE KIDDIES

00:57:01.584 --> 00:57:03.086
PROJECT FOR A YEAR AND A HALF.

00:57:03.153 --> 00:57:04.254
SAID MULTIPLE HEARINGS AND I

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:05.555
THINK THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE

00:57:05.622 --> 00:57:08.858
THE HEARING -- WE HAVE A MOTION

00:57:08.925 --> 00:57:09.959

BASED ON THE OPPOSITION.

00:57:21.871 --> 00:57:22.872
AND AND FROM WHAT WE'VE HEARD

00:57:22.939 --> 00:57:25.642
AND THAT IF WE DO TAKE THESE

00:57:25.708 --> 00:57:26.876
AMENDMENTS ARE THE SENATOR.

00:57:26.943 --> 00:57:27.377
WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THESE

00:57:27.443 --> 00:57:29.212
AMENDMENTS THE OPPOSITION GETS

00:57:29.279 --> 00:57:30.413
REMOVED.

00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:31.181
I THINK INSTEAD OF GOING BACK

00:57:31.247 --> 00:57:33.349
AND FORTH ARE PUSHING A BILL

00:57:33.416 --> 00:57:34.651

00:57:34.717 --> 00:57:35.418
LET'S JUST TAKE THE TIME TO

00:57:35.485 --> 00:57:37.287
ACTUALLY BETTER ANALYZE AND SEE

00:57:37.353 --> 00:57:38.688
WHAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US.

00:57:38.755 --> 00:57:40.256
SO WE CAN ALL COME BACK AND HAVE

00:57:40.323 --> 00:57:42.358
A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT WE'RE

00:57:42.425 --> 00:57:47.096

00:57:47.163 --> 00:57:48.832

MOTION THAT'S ON ON THE TABLE --

00:57:58.842 --> 00:58:00.243
THERE'S ALSO A WORLD WHERE

00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:01.811
AMENDMENTS COULD HAPPEN IN THE

00:58:01.878 --> 00:58:04.080

01:02:45.628 --> 01:02:47.363
PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD -- ANY

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:49.198
STUDENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW --

01:02:49.265 --> 01:02:50.867
UNDERSTANDS THAT IN

01:02:50.933 --> 01:02:53.002
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY.

01:02:53.069 --> 01:02:54.904
AXE NOT BY FINDING THE ACT BY

01:02:54.971 --> 01:02:56.806
DETERMINATION -- A DETERMINATION

01:02:56.873 --> 01:02:58.975
MUST BE SUPPORTED BY FINDINGS

01:02:59.041 --> 01:03:00.376
WHICH MUST BE SUPPORTED BY FACTS.

01:03:00.443 --> 01:03:02.345
AND THIS IS THE THE TYPICAL

01:03:02.411 --> 01:03:03.479
STANDARD THAT SUPPLIED IN AN

01:03:03.546 --> 01:03:05.014
ADMINISTRATIVE CONTEXT WE'RE NOT

01:03:05.081 --> 01:03:06.782
ASKING FOR SOMETHING THAT FAVORS

01:03:06.849 --> 01:03:08.151
KIDDIES WERE ASKING FOR

01:03:08.217 --> 01:03:09.852
SOMETHING SYMMETRICAL -- I KNOW

01:03:09.919 --> 01:03:10.486
IT'S HARD FOR SOME PEOPLE TO

01:03:10.553 --> 01:03:12.688
BELIEVE BUT WEARE A BELIEVER IN

01:03:12.755 --> 01:03:14.657
SCIENCE WE ARE WE DO EMBRACE

01:03:14.724 --> 01:03:15.625
REVIEW.

01:03:15.691 --> 01:03:17.727
WE ALREADY SUBMITTED TO A FIFTY

01:03:17.793 --> 01:03:19.695
YEAR ONGOING REVIEW ANNUAL

01:03:19.762 --> 01:03:21.097
REVIEW BY SAM MEDINA COUNTY.

01:03:21.164 --> 01:03:23.399
SO WE'RE NOT AFRAID OF THE

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:25.201
INTROSPECTION OR THE REVIEW WE

01:03:25.268 --> 01:03:26.602
JUST WANT THERE TO BE CLOSER TO

01:03:26.669 --> 01:03:28.804
A PROCESS AND WE DON'T WANT

01:03:28.871 --> 01:03:31.307
WHETHER EITHER SIDE IS AGGRIEVED.

01:03:31.374 --> 01:03:32.608
OUGHT TO BE.

01:03:32.675 --> 01:03:35.545
PREVENTED FROM KNOWING THE BASIS

01:03:35.611 --> 01:03:37.079
FOR THE DECISION WHICH MUST BE

01:03:37.146 --> 01:03:38.781
PROVIDED AND THEN THE

01:03:38.848 --> 01:03:40.082
DETERMINATION WOULD SUGGEST IT'S

01:03:40.149 --> 01:03:41.250
FINAL.

01:03:41.317 --> 01:03:43.019
AS OPPOSED TO BEING A DO LOOP

01:03:43.085 --> 01:03:44.120
WHICH NEVER ENDS WELL IT'S A

01:03:44.187 --> 01:03:45.888
IT'S A FINDING IT'S NOT A

01:03:45.955 --> 01:03:47.323
DETERMINATION SO NO.

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:48.925
ONE CAN DO ANYTHING WITH IT.

01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:50.626
AND AND SO ANOTHER WORDS FOR

01:03:50.693 --> 01:03:52.328
THOSE THAT WERE LAWYERS IT'S NOT

01:03:52.395 --> 01:03:54.030
JUSTICIABLE BECAUSE IT'S NOT

01:03:54.096 --> 01:03:57.800
OVER YET IT'S JUST CONTINUING SO.

01:03:57.867 --> 01:03:58.968
VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE WORD

01:03:59.035 --> 01:04:01.737
DETERMINATION SUBSTITUTED FOR

01:04:01.804 --> 01:04:03.573
FINDING I WOULD ALSO SAY IT IS

01:04:03.639 --> 01:04:04.840
THE SAME TERM.

01:04:04.907 --> 01:04:06.175
THAT IS USED IN THE BALANCE OF

01:04:06.242 --> 01:04:08.144
THE CHAPTER THAT THIS BILL IS

01:04:08.211 --> 01:04:11.447
BEING ADDED INTO THIS BECOMES

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:14.083
EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN IF YOU REVIEW

01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.617
EIGHTEEN TEN ELEVEN TWELVE

01:04:14.684 --> 01:04:18.854
THIRTEEN AND FOURTEEN THEY ALL

01:04:18.921 --> 01:04:21.090
USE THE WORD DETERMINATION.

01:04:21.157 --> 01:04:22.091
NO WORD OF THESE FINDINGS.

01:04:22.158 --> 01:04:23.392
SO THAT'S THE FIRST -- ONE THE

01:04:23.459 --> 01:04:24.560
SECOND ONE HAS TO PERTAIN TO THE

01:04:24.627 --> 01:04:24.794
TIMING.

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:26.162
NOW THE WAY THE AUTHORS DRAFTED

01:04:26.229 --> 01:04:27.263
THE BILL.

01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:29.999
IT PUTS THE BURDEN OF PROOF.

01:04:30.066 --> 01:04:31.867
ON KIDDIES AND SANTA MARGARITA

01:04:31.934 --> 01:04:33.402
AND ANYBODY ELSE WHO'S PROPOSING

01:04:33.469 --> 01:04:34.170
TO TRANSFER.

01:04:34.237 --> 01:04:36.305
A SHORTENED TIME PERIOD DOES NOT

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:37.206
FAVOR US.

01:04:37.273 --> 01:04:39.575
IT WORKS AGAINST US. TO WHICH WE

01:04:39.642 --> 01:04:41.777
MUST BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN

01:04:41.844 --> 01:04:43.846
BEFORE WE SUBMIT BECAUSE BY THE

01:04:43.913 --> 01:04:45.514
MERE PASSAGE OF TIME IF THEY ARE

01:04:45.581 --> 01:04:47.183
UNABLE TO REACH THE FINDING.

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:48.684
THE PREJUDICE RESULTS TO US AND

01:04:48.751 --> 01:04:50.386
A REJECTION.

01:04:50.453 --> 01:04:54.190
CONVERSELY BY PUTTING A TWO YEAR.

01:04:54.257 --> 01:04:56.826
WINDOW TO REVIEW THE EFFORT HERE

01:04:56.892 --> 01:04:59.362
IS REALLY TO BE HONEST TO CREATE

01:04:59.428 --> 01:05:04.033
A WAY. TO S. -- MAKE THE

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:05.768
EXISTING E. I. R. STALE.

01:05:05.835 --> 01:05:07.703
THE PROJECT ITSELF WAS ALREADY

01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:09.272
GONE THROUGH A A ENVIRONMENTAL

01:05:09.338 --> 01:05:11.173
REVIEW IT WENT THROUGH A COUNTY

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.608
INDEPENDENT REVIEW PROCESS WHICH

01:05:12.675 --> 01:05:13.876
IS RARELY MENTIONED.

01:05:13.943 --> 01:05:15.645
BOTH PURSUED WE WENT THROUGH

01:05:15.711 --> 01:05:16.979
TRIAL AND ON APPEAL.

01:05:17.046 --> 01:05:18.414
SO HERE WE ARE WITH THOSE

01:05:18.481 --> 01:05:20.349
APPROVALS IN TWENTY TWELVE NOW

01:05:20.416 --> 01:05:21.617
WE'RE IN.

01:05:21.684 --> 01:05:22.485
TWENTY NINETEEN WE CAN EVEN

01:05:22.551 --> 01:05:25.321
APPLY TO JANUARY OF TWENTY

01:05:25.388 --> 01:05:26.389
TWENTY AND THEN IT COULD BE TWO

01:05:26.455 --> 01:05:28.958
YEARS AND THE VERY SAME PEOPLE.

01:05:29.025 --> 01:05:30.393
WHO ARE OPPOSING THE PROJECT NOW

01:05:30.459 --> 01:05:32.028
WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAY

01:05:32.094 --> 01:05:32.695
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED TO START

01:05:32.762 --> 01:05:33.729
OVER AGAIN?

01:05:33.796 --> 01:05:34.964
AND FOR ANYBODY WHO HAS A WATER

01:05:35.031 --> 01:05:36.365
PROJECT ANYWHERE IN THE STATE OR

01:05:36.432 --> 01:05:37.900
ANY OTHER KIND OF PROJECT THEY

01:05:37.967 --> 01:05:38.801
SHOULD BE TERRIFIED WITH THAT

01:05:38.868 --> 01:05:40.736
OUTCOME BECAUSE ALL YOU NEED TO

01:05:40.803 --> 01:05:42.271
DO IS RUN OUT THE CLOCK.

01:05:42.338 --> 01:05:44.273
AND THE THIRD ITEM IS TO MAKE

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:46.609
EXPRESS WHICH SHOULD BE IMPLIED

01:05:46.676 --> 01:05:48.277
BUT WE'D LIKE IT TO BE EXPRESS.

01:05:48.344 --> 01:05:49.945
AND THAT IS THAT IN MAKING A

01:05:50.012 --> 01:05:51.781
DECISION JUST LIKE THE STATE

01:05:51.847 --> 01:05:52.548
WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:53.582
DOES.

01:05:53.649 --> 01:05:54.650
JUST LIKE YOUR SUSTAINABLE

01:05:54.717 --> 01:05:56.519
GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT

01:05:56.585 --> 01:05:57.520
PROCESS.

01:05:57.586 --> 01:05:58.788
WE WOULD LIKE THE STATE LANDS

01:05:58.854 --> 01:06:00.523
COMMISSION TO HAVE AN OBLIGATION

01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:01.557
TO SAY IF THERE COULD BE

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:04.193
MITIGATION.

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:05.695
HERE IT IS DO IT AND THEN

01:06:05.761 --> 01:06:07.863
THERE'S A CONSEQUENCE ACOSTA

01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:09.031
CONSEQUENCE EMBRACE ME WHETHER

01:06:09.098 --> 01:06:10.066
WE GO FOR WITH THE PROJECT OR

01:06:10.132 --> 01:06:10.700
NOT.

01:06:10.766 --> 01:06:11.967
BUT AT LEAST WE WOULD NOW

01:06:12.034 --> 01:06:13.469
WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A CURABLE

01:06:13.536 --> 01:06:15.471
DEFECT AND COULD INVESTIGATE THE

01:06:15.538 --> 01:06:17.073
COST SO.

01:06:17.139 --> 01:06:19.175
WE'RE NOT AGAINST TRANSPARENCY

01:06:19.241 --> 01:06:20.943
WE'RE NOT AGAINST ASSUMING THE

01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:21.877
BURDEN OF PROOF.

01:06:21.944 --> 01:06:23.713
AND WE'RE CERTAINLY NOT TRYING

01:06:23.779 --> 01:06:25.514
TO IMPOSE A STANDARD WHICH IS A

01:06:25.581 --> 01:06:26.549
SYMMETRICAL ANDONLY WORKS FOR

01:06:26.615 --> 01:06:28.417
KIDDIES AS BENEFIT THE PUBLIC

01:06:28.484 --> 01:06:30.419
SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT.

01:06:30.486 --> 01:06:32.455
WHETHER ARTS OPPONENTS OR US. TO

01:06:32.521 --> 01:06:34.256
BE ABLE TO KNOW THAT THERE IS AN

01:06:34.323 --> 01:06:34.857
INTO THIS PROCESS [inaudible]

01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:37.560
THANK YOU.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'LL LET ME

01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:42.698
BEGIN BY THANKING THE

01:06:42.765 --> 01:06:45.401
REPRESENTATIVES FROM BOTH SIDES

01:06:45.468 --> 01:06:46.535
FOR VISITING MY OFFICE SAID

01:06:46.602 --> 01:06:47.737
EARLIER.

01:06:47.803 --> 01:06:50.506
OUR FINAL AYE A WE DEALT WITH

01:06:50.573 --> 01:06:52.174
THE SOME OF THE BILL -- BEFORE

01:06:52.241 --> 01:06:53.976
ARE BUT IT WAS -- VERY HELPFUL

01:06:54.043 --> 01:06:55.644
AND EDUCATIONAL SECOND TIME

01:06:55.711 --> 01:06:57.279
AROUND BECAUSE I GOT TO LEARN.

01:06:57.346 --> 01:06:59.415
A FEW THINGS I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT

01:06:59.482 --> 01:07:01.851
SO I'M I'M GRATEFUL -- NOW THE

01:07:01.917 --> 01:07:03.386
OPPOSITION I THINK EARLIER

01:07:03.452 --> 01:07:08.524
RAISED THE DHEA ASSERTION THAT

01:07:08.591 --> 01:07:10.793
THIS IS KIND OF ON PRESIDENT IT --

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:11.560
I THINK OF ONE OF THE REASONS

01:07:11.627 --> 01:07:14.029
FOR THIS PROPOSAL IS SAYS SAID

01:07:14.096 --> 01:07:14.864
THAT.

01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:17.133
THE PROJECT WILL WILL UNDERGO AN

01:07:17.199 --> 01:07:20.870
INDEPENDENT UNDERSCORING

01:07:20.936 --> 01:07:22.638
INDEPENDENT REVIEW.

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:23.572
AND ARE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING

01:07:23.639 --> 01:07:26.642
ALSO THAT -- WHEN THE ORIGINAL

01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:29.111
YARO IS FOR SHE CONDUCTED?

01:07:29.178 --> 01:07:31.147
OF THE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION

01:07:31.213 --> 01:07:33.616
WAS ESPECIALLY PROVIDED BY COULD

01:07:33.682 --> 01:07:39.054
DIS ARM AND SO -- SANTA

01:07:39.121 --> 01:07:40.623
MARGARITA ESSENTIALLY DID SOME

01:07:40.689 --> 01:07:42.358
CERTIFICATION BASED ON THE

01:07:42.425 --> 01:07:45.728
SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION THAT WAS

01:07:45.795 --> 01:07:47.363
PROVIDED TO THEM.

01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:48.764
AND WHEN THE KIDS WAS LITIGATED

01:07:48.831 --> 01:07:53.269
IN COURT ARE THE CORD WAS ALSO.

01:07:53.335 --> 01:07:54.770
BASICALLY DOWN BY THE

01:07:54.837 --> 01:07:55.271
INFORMATION SCIENTIFIC

01:07:55.337 --> 01:07:57.006
INFORMATION THAT WAS PROVIDED TO

01:07:57.072 --> 01:07:57.840
IT.

01:07:57.907 --> 01:07:59.241
WITHOUT GOING BEYOND WHAT'S --

01:07:59.308 --> 01:08:00.543
WHAT'S OUT THERE.

01:08:00.609 --> 01:08:02.912
SO I THINK WHAT DE A PROPOSAL

01:08:02.978 --> 01:08:05.114
INTENDS TO DO IS TO I'LL GET A

01:08:05.181 --> 01:08:07.883
MORE INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF THE

01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:10.219
PROCESS.

01:08:10.286 --> 01:08:10.753
I'M.

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:13.022
SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE I'M

01:08:13.088 --> 01:08:14.690
COMING FROM I I THINK IN THE

01:08:14.757 --> 01:08:15.758
PAST I SUPPORTED ASSEMBLY BILL

01:08:15.825 --> 01:08:16.926
AS I MENTIONED.

01:08:16.992 --> 01:08:19.895
AND AS TO THE DEFINITION -- DE

01:08:19.962 --> 01:08:20.696
THE PROPOSED CHANGED FROM

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:24.133
FINDINGS TO DETERMINATION I IT'S

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:26.769
MY UNDERSTANDING THAT ARE THE

01:08:26.836 --> 01:08:28.437
CODE SECTION CC PECOS ACTION

01:08:28.504 --> 01:08:29.972
DOES CONTAIN BOTH.

01:08:30.039 --> 01:08:33.442
OF THE TERM FINDING AS WELL AS

01:08:33.509 --> 01:08:35.277
DETERMINATION AND AND BOTH

01:08:35.344 --> 01:08:38.113
TERMINOLOGIES WOULD ENTITLE OF

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:40.416
FOR AN APPEAL PROCESS TO BE MADE

01:08:40.483 --> 01:08:42.351
THAT IS THE RATE OF MEN DAMOS

01:08:42.418 --> 01:08:43.385
RIGHT REALLY MANDATE.

01:08:43.452 --> 01:08:44.687
SO AS FAR AS THE PRACTICAL

01:08:44.753 --> 01:08:46.489
EFFECT IS CONCERNED I I DON'T

01:08:46.555 --> 01:08:47.790
THINK IT MAKES A DISTINCTION

01:08:47.857 --> 01:08:51.026
BETWEEN DETERMINATION ARE.

01:08:51.093 --> 01:08:53.062
AND FINING SO SO BOB YOU KNOW

01:08:53.128 --> 01:08:54.697
IT'S A SO I TEND TO AGREE WITH

01:08:54.763 --> 01:08:57.466
THE AUTHOR IN THAT YOU KNOW IT'S

01:08:57.533 --> 01:08:58.701
IT'S THE IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S THE

01:08:58.767 --> 01:09:02.404
SAME AS FAR AS PRACTICALITIES

01:09:02.471 --> 01:09:03.339
CONCERN.

01:09:03.405 --> 01:09:05.307
SO I'M I'M INCLINED TO SUPPORT

01:09:05.374 --> 01:09:07.443
THE BUILD UP BASED ON NOT A

01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:07.643
THINK.

01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:08.644
UP.

01:09:08.711 --> 01:09:11.380
AND THE OTHER OF MEN MEN THAT

01:09:11.447 --> 01:09:12.982
WAS SO BEING PROPOSED I I DON'T

01:09:13.048 --> 01:09:14.283
THINK THE AUTHOR IS IN AGREEMENT

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:15.050
WITH THAT THERE'S A TIME FRAME

01:09:15.117 --> 01:09:17.586
WHICH HE THEN SEEM TO AGREE WITH.

01:09:17.653 --> 01:09:20.890
SO -- YOU KNOW.

01:09:20.956 --> 01:09:22.858
IT M. ICE BASICALLY ARE

01:09:22.925 --> 01:09:24.026
OPERATING ON THE CORRECT

01:09:24.093 --> 01:09:25.961
INFORMATION AND WHAT I WHAT I

01:09:26.028 --> 01:09:28.597
STATED EARLIER -- I ACTUALLY I

01:09:28.664 --> 01:09:30.165
JUST WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY --

01:09:30.232 --> 01:09:32.434
THAT THE PROJECT OPPONENTS OFTEN

01:09:32.501 --> 01:09:33.802
SITE TO THE ABSENCE OF

01:09:33.869 --> 01:09:35.070
INDEPENDENCE AN ENVIRONMENTAL

01:09:35.137 --> 01:09:36.138
REVIEW AND I WOULD LIKE THE

01:09:36.205 --> 01:09:37.239
COMMITTEE TO KNOW.

01:09:37.306 --> 01:09:38.073
THAT THE UNITED STATES

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:39.475
GOVERNMENT IN TWO THOUSAND AND

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:40.543
TWO THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR

01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:42.545
WITH THE FULL VALUE OF THE U. S.

01:09:42.611 --> 01:09:43.913
G. S. OPINION.

01:09:43.979 --> 01:09:46.015
IN TWO THOUSAND TWO APPROVED ANY

01:09:46.081 --> 01:09:48.117
I. S. AND FOUND THAT THE PROJECT

01:09:48.183 --> 01:09:49.552
COULD BE CONDUCTED.

01:09:49.618 --> 01:09:51.921
WITH THREE TIMES THE PUMPING

01:09:51.987 --> 01:09:52.788
RATE WITH NO ADVERSE IMPACT.

01:09:52.855 --> 01:09:54.723
SO THAT WAS A DECISION THAT WAS

01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:55.925
PUBLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND AND

01:09:55.991 --> 01:09:57.726
TWO WE REDUCE THE SIZE BY THREE

01:09:57.793 --> 01:09:59.161
TIMES.

01:09:59.228 --> 01:09:59.662
AND THEN SANTA MARGARITA

01:09:59.728 --> 01:10:02.064
REVIEWED IT.

01:10:02.131 --> 01:10:03.465
AND THEN THE COUNTY.

01:10:03.532 --> 01:10:05.034
REVIEWED IT TO THE COUNTY WAS

01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:06.502
NOT BOUND BY.

01:10:06.569 --> 01:10:08.237
THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT

01:10:08.304 --> 01:10:09.738
IT CAUSED ITS OWN SET OF

01:10:09.805 --> 01:10:10.873
HEARINGS.

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:13.075
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TESTIFIED IN

01:10:13.142 --> 01:10:15.177
A BIG IMPOSED A STOPPER ON

01:10:15.244 --> 01:10:16.478
GROUNDWATER WITHDRAWALS THE

01:10:16.545 --> 01:10:17.846
EVENT THAT THERE WERE ADVERSE

01:10:17.913 --> 01:10:19.515
IMPACTS SO THOSE.

01:10:19.582 --> 01:10:21.951
THOSE THREE REVIEWS -- ALL

01:10:22.017 --> 01:10:24.286
OCCURRED IN NONETHELESS WE'RE

01:10:24.353 --> 01:10:26.121
NOT OPPOSED. TO A NEW LEVEL

01:10:26.188 --> 01:10:27.423
REVIEW AS LONG AS IT GETS

01:10:27.489 --> 01:10:29.158
DAYLIGHT.

01:10:29.224 --> 01:10:33.028
I IN HIS OPEN AND TRANSPARENT.

01:10:33.095 --> 01:10:34.363
YEAH I GONNA GIVE DHEA PROPONE

01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:36.031
AND THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO

01:10:36.098 --> 01:10:39.234
RESPOND ALSO IF US SO DESIRE.

01:10:39.301 --> 01:10:39.868
WELL.

01:10:39.935 --> 01:10:40.736
YOU KNOW A CERTAIN THE THE

01:10:40.803 --> 01:10:43.005
PROBLEM IS THE SCIENCE IS IN

01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:44.807
CONFLICT IN THE U. S. GEOLOGICAL

01:10:44.873 --> 01:10:46.075
SURVEY IN THE NATIONAL PARK

01:10:46.141 --> 01:10:48.110
SERVICE AND AND THE REST OF

01:10:48.177 --> 01:10:50.512
THOSE SCIENTISTS.

01:10:50.579 --> 01:10:51.847
THAT ORIGINALLY OPINED ON THIS

01:10:51.914 --> 01:10:53.449
PROJECT AND DETERMINED THAT THE

01:10:53.515 --> 01:10:55.117
PUMPING RATE WAS NOT SUSTAINABLE

01:10:55.184 --> 01:10:56.619
COUNTRY.

01:10:56.685 --> 01:10:58.420
TO COULD DISSPOSITION BY THE WE

01:10:58.487 --> 01:11:00.222
COULD USE AS A RATHER NOVEL --

01:11:00.289 --> 01:11:01.624
THEORY OF PUMPING HAVING TO DO

01:11:01.690 --> 01:11:04.093
WITH EVAPORATION AND IT AND

01:11:04.159 --> 01:11:05.094
COULD EASE MAYBE RIGHT.

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:06.128
BUT WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS

01:11:06.195 --> 01:11:07.463
WHETHER COULD EASE IS RIGHT OR

01:11:07.529 --> 01:11:09.865
NOT AND IF COULD EASE IS WRONG.

01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:12.101
WE COULD DO A REPUTABLE HARM TO

01:11:12.167 --> 01:11:13.936
THE MOJAVE DESERT SO THAT'S WHY

01:11:14.003 --> 01:11:15.638
I GOT INVOLVED IN THIS IS YOU

01:11:15.704 --> 01:11:16.739
KNOW I'M NOT KNOWN.

01:11:16.805 --> 01:11:18.307
I DON'T COMMENDED THIS COMMITTEE

01:11:18.374 --> 01:11:19.842
VERY OFTEN I DON'T GENERALLY

01:11:19.908 --> 01:11:20.976
CARRY WATER BILLS I'M NOT KNOWN

01:11:21.043 --> 01:11:22.645
AS AN ENVIRONMENTALIST BUT IT

01:11:22.711 --> 01:11:23.312
SEEMED.

01:11:23.379 --> 01:11:25.581
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE TO ME THAT

01:11:25.648 --> 01:11:27.449
YOU COULD HAVE THESE RATHER

01:11:27.516 --> 01:11:31.353
SIGNIFICANT CONFLICTS IN SCIENCE.

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:33.088
IN ITS SCIENCE.

01:11:33.155 --> 01:11:34.356
NOW MAYBE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT

01:11:34.423 --> 01:11:35.858
OF WIGGLE ROOM WAS SCIENCE BUT

01:11:35.924 --> 01:11:37.793
WE NEED TO DETERMINE WHAT THE

01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:38.894
ENVIRONMENTAL BERMAN ONLY

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:41.196
SUSTAINABLE PUMPING RATE IS.

01:11:41.263 --> 01:11:43.298
AND THAT'S WHY WE PUT TOGETHER

01:11:43.365 --> 01:11:45.501
THE BILL IT IS SIMPLY ACE

01:11:45.567 --> 01:11:47.569
SCIENTIFIC REVIEW AND

01:11:47.636 --> 01:11:50.739
RECONCILIATION IT IS FINDINGS.

01:11:50.806 --> 01:11:53.976
OF FACT ON THAT POINT NOT

01:11:54.043 --> 01:11:55.044
DISCRETION DISK.

01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:57.079
THE DISK DISCRETIONARY DECISION

01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:59.915
MAKING -- IT IS A IT IS A

01:11:59.982 --> 01:12:02.518
FINDING AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:12:02.584 --> 01:12:04.887
TRYING TO DO HERE -- HOWEVER

01:12:04.953 --> 01:12:06.288
QUICKLY WE CAN POSSIBLY DO IT

01:12:06.355 --> 01:12:09.925
THANK YOU [inaudible]

01:12:09.992 --> 01:12:11.126
BACK [inaudible]

01:12:11.193 --> 01:12:13.896
HEY.

01:12:13.962 --> 01:12:17.166
THE MISTER MATHIS.

01:12:17.232 --> 01:12:18.967
SENATOR IT'S IT'S MY

01:12:19.034 --> 01:12:22.304
UNDERSTANDING THAT -- THIS

01:12:22.371 --> 01:12:25.674
PROJECT STILL ON HAS THE

01:12:25.741 --> 01:12:27.609
COMPLETE A PERMIT APPROVAL AND

01:12:27.676 --> 01:12:29.478
METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT.

01:12:29.545 --> 01:12:33.415
THE PERMIT PROCESS A C. D. F. W..

01:12:33.482 --> 01:12:35.050
FOR STREAMBED ALTERATIONS AND IS

01:12:35.117 --> 01:12:37.186
SUBJECT TO D. W. R. SIGMA

01:12:37.252 --> 01:12:39.988
CRITERIA FOUR SO CONCERNED ABOUT

01:12:40.055 --> 01:12:42.357
THE SCIENCE ARE YOU SAYING THAT

01:12:42.424 --> 01:12:43.292
THOSE.

01:12:43.358 --> 01:12:44.259
PROCESSES ARE GONNA DIG INTO THE

01:12:44.326 --> 01:12:46.929
SCIENCE IN THE DETAILS.

01:12:46.995 --> 01:12:48.130
THEN IN THAT.

01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:48.931
I MEAN COULD BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:12:48.997 --> 01:12:50.332
OBVIOUSLY GOING TO LOOK AT THE

01:12:50.399 --> 01:12:52.534
SCIENCE OF THEIR AND SO I MEAN

01:12:52.601 --> 01:12:54.103
NIGHT I THINK I WOULD PERSONALLY

01:12:54.169 --> 01:12:55.771
RATHER STICK WITH WHAT'S BEEN

01:12:55.838 --> 01:12:57.239
TESTED IN TRUE SPECIALLY WITH

01:12:57.306 --> 01:13:01.610
THE NEW SIGMAR REGULATIONS --

01:13:01.677 --> 01:13:03.212
AND THEN CREATE A WHOLE SEPARATE

01:13:03.278 --> 01:13:04.313
PROCESS ON MAYNARD ARE YOU

01:13:04.379 --> 01:13:06.014
SEEING THE PROCESS IS THERE ARE

01:13:06.081 --> 01:13:07.049
ACCURATE.

01:13:07.116 --> 01:13:09.618
AND THAT.

01:13:09.685 --> 01:13:10.352
PART OF THE REASON WHY WE NEED

01:13:10.419 --> 01:13:11.720
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

01:13:11.787 --> 01:13:13.889
WELL LET ME JUST TRY TO CLARIFY

01:13:13.956 --> 01:13:14.590
THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND

01:13:14.656 --> 01:13:15.390
WILDLIFE.

01:13:15.457 --> 01:13:16.658
DEALS WITH LAKE INSTREAM BUT

01:13:16.725 --> 01:13:18.160
ALTERATION AGREEMENTS SO THE

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:19.161
DEPARTMENT THAT PARTICULAR

01:13:19.228 --> 01:13:21.130
DEPARTMENT'S GOING TO LOOK AT

01:13:21.196 --> 01:13:22.798
THE PROJECT AS IT PERTAINS.

01:13:22.865 --> 01:13:23.966
TO STREAM BED AN IMPACT ON

01:13:24.032 --> 01:13:25.968
STREAM BUT NOT ENVIRONMENTALLY

01:13:26.034 --> 01:13:27.569
SUSTAINABLE PUMPING RATES AND

01:13:27.636 --> 01:13:29.338
THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT

01:13:29.404 --> 01:13:31.273
BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:35.277
DISTRICT IN THE USE OF THE THE

01:13:35.344 --> 01:13:36.979
CONVEYANCE DEVICE -- WILL BE

01:13:37.045 --> 01:13:37.679
TALKING ABOUT WHEELING

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:39.081
AGREEMENTS AND LOOKING AT

01:13:39.148 --> 01:13:40.849
WHETHER THE WATER QUALITY THAT'S

01:13:40.916 --> 01:13:42.818
BEING PUMPED INTO THE CONVEYANCE.

01:13:42.885 --> 01:13:43.952
IS GOING TO CAUSE A

01:13:44.019 --> 01:13:45.254
DETERIORATION IN THE WATER

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:46.255
QUALITY IN A WHOLE VARIETY OF

01:13:46.321 --> 01:13:47.990
OTHER THINGS NOT WHETHER THE

01:13:48.056 --> 01:13:49.358
PUMPING RATE OF THE MOJAVE

01:13:49.424 --> 01:13:50.726
DESERT AND THE AQUIFER

01:13:50.793 --> 01:13:51.360
UNDERNEATH IT.

01:13:51.426 --> 01:13:52.895
IS ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE

01:13:52.961 --> 01:13:54.530
SO THEY THEY'RE THERE ARE

01:13:54.596 --> 01:13:56.365
FURTHER REVIEWS INCLUDING A BY

01:13:56.431 --> 01:13:58.033
THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION IF

01:13:58.100 --> 01:13:59.902
THIS PARTICULAR OF PROJECT IN

01:13:59.968 --> 01:14:01.236
THE PIPE CROSSES STATE LANCER

01:14:01.303 --> 01:14:03.372
NEEDS TO BE A A LEASE AGREEMENT

01:14:03.438 --> 01:14:05.841
NEGOCIO SO DID OF YOU ARE SICK

01:14:05.908 --> 01:14:07.643
MY PROCESS AND SYMBOL THAT

01:14:07.709 --> 01:14:08.777
CRITERIA IS NOT.

01:14:08.844 --> 01:14:10.946
GOOD ENOUGH THIS SIGNAL DOES NOT

01:14:11.013 --> 01:14:12.781
REALLY AFFECT CAN COULD DISS OWN

01:14:12.848 --> 01:14:13.849
I BELIEVE THE OWN THEIR OWN

01:14:13.916 --> 01:14:15.250
APPELLATE DECISION.

01:14:15.317 --> 01:14:17.286
THE THE PARTY NOTES THAT COULD

01:14:17.352 --> 01:14:18.487
THAT SIGNAL IS NOT APPLICABLE TO

01:14:18.554 --> 01:14:20.289
THIS PROJECT TO LOW PRIORITY

01:14:20.355 --> 01:14:23.225
BASIN THERE ESSENTIALLY. THREE

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:24.560
LANDOWNERS THAT POTENTIALLY DRAW

01:14:24.626 --> 01:14:26.361
FROM THE AQUIFER KIDDIES THE

01:14:26.428 --> 01:14:28.530
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE STATE AS

01:14:28.597 --> 01:14:30.132
YOU KNOW SIGNAL IS DESIGNED. FOR

01:14:30.199 --> 01:14:31.500
EXAMPLE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY

01:14:31.567 --> 01:14:33.202
WHERE YOU HAVE NUMEROUS

01:14:33.268 --> 01:14:34.903
LANDOWNERS DRAWING FROM THE SAME.

01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:37.172
AQUIFER A WITHOUT ADJUDICATION

01:14:37.239 --> 01:14:38.707
TO TRY TO RESOLVE DEVELOP A

01:14:38.774 --> 01:14:41.243
GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:43.278
MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR THOSE AREAS.

01:14:43.345 --> 01:14:44.980
ABSOLUTELY AND I WAS NEVER VERY

01:14:45.047 --> 01:14:46.014
FAMILIAR SICKENING WHEN THEY

01:14:46.081 --> 01:14:47.115
HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S A

01:14:47.182 --> 01:14:48.784
STANDALONE THERE'S SEVERAL

01:14:48.851 --> 01:14:50.319
PROJECTS THAT YOU KNOWSOME OF

01:14:50.385 --> 01:14:51.887
THE CONCERNS HE STATED EARLIER

01:14:51.954 --> 01:14:57.392
WERE THAT.

01:14:57.459 --> 01:14:59.361
YOU KNOW THEY CAN PUMP.

01:14:59.428 --> 01:15:00.762
MORE THAN WHAT IS KNOWN TO BE IN

01:15:00.829 --> 01:15:02.130
THE BASIN BUT WE HAVE SEVERAL

01:15:02.197 --> 01:15:04.299
PROJECTS IN EVEN INCLUDED

01:15:04.366 --> 01:15:05.601
PROJECTS.

01:15:05.667 --> 01:15:06.735
AND NEAR DISTRICT THAT PUMP MORE

01:15:06.802 --> 01:15:08.203
THAN WHAT IS TYPICALLY

01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:09.238
INNOVATION FROM THE RAINFALL SO

01:15:09.304 --> 01:15:09.571
I MEAN THOSE.

01:15:09.638 --> 01:15:11.106
THOSE NUMBERS IN THE SCIENCE ALL

01:15:11.173 --> 01:15:11.907
OVER THE STATE OUR OUR OFFICE

01:15:11.974 --> 01:15:13.008
THAT'S GOING TO BE THE BASIS OF

01:15:13.075 --> 01:15:16.078
THIS DECISION. TO WANT TO HAVE A

01:15:16.144 --> 01:15:17.779
NEW GROUNDS.

01:15:17.846 --> 01:15:21.316
THROUGH -- THE LAND A THIRTY

01:15:21.383 --> 01:15:22.584
WHICH YOUR BILL WOULD DEAL BUT I

01:15:22.651 --> 01:15:25.053
MEAN IT'S WE WE'VE SEEN THIS.

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:26.922
ALL THESE DIFFERENT PROCESSES GO

01:15:26.989 --> 01:15:29.324
FORWARD WE'VE SEEN A SIGNAL

01:15:29.391 --> 01:15:30.959
PROCESS GO FORWARD WE'VE SEEN.

01:15:31.026 --> 01:15:33.428
SEVERAL DIFFERENT PIECES

01:15:33.495 --> 01:15:35.197
DIFFERENT COURT DECISIONS

01:15:35.264 --> 01:15:36.064
EVERYTHING ELSE LITIGATION AND I

01:15:36.131 --> 01:15:39.902
MEAN. TO TO SAY THAT.

01:15:39.968 --> 01:15:41.737
ALL THE RIGOROUS PROCESSES IN

01:15:41.803 --> 01:15:42.971
THE SCIENCE THROUGH EVERYTHING

01:15:43.038 --> 01:15:44.940
ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH.

01:15:45.007 --> 01:15:46.808
THAT WE NEED A NEW SCIENTIFIC

01:15:46.875 --> 01:15:49.311
REVIEW. FOR THAT THAT HASN'T

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:50.946
BEEN DONE BEFORE I MEAN I'M I'M

01:15:51.013 --> 01:15:53.282
JUST CURIOUS SENATOR IN AND I

01:15:53.348 --> 01:15:54.783
KNOW YOU'RE.

01:15:54.850 --> 01:15:55.784
A MAN OF THE LAWN A MAN WANTS TO

01:15:55.851 --> 01:15:57.853
SEE FARE THINGS HAPPEN.

01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:59.621
SO I MEAN I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO

01:15:59.688 --> 01:16:01.089
WHY WE WOULD CREATE A NEW

01:16:01.156 --> 01:16:02.391
PROCESS.

01:16:02.457 --> 01:16:04.927
WHEN THIS PROJECT STILL AS OTHER

01:16:04.993 --> 01:16:06.962
PROCESSES TO GO FORWARD TO IT'S

01:16:07.029 --> 01:16:07.863
STILL GOING TO GET THROUGH D. W.

01:16:07.930 --> 01:16:10.499
R. AND IT'S ALREADY BEEN THROUGH

01:16:10.565 --> 01:16:11.533
SEQUEL?

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:13.802
WILL MAKE MAY I COMMENT ON THE

01:16:13.869 --> 01:16:16.338
MAY I ADDRESS THE SEQUEL ISSUE.

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:17.139
ABSOLUTELY VENTURE.

01:16:17.205 --> 01:16:18.440
YOU SEEK WAS A PUBLIC DISCLOSURE

01:16:18.507 --> 01:16:19.007
STATUTES DESIGN AND NOTIFY

01:16:19.074 --> 01:16:20.075
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT

01:16:20.142 --> 01:16:22.311
THERE'S A PROJECT. TO IDENTIFY --

01:16:22.377 --> 01:16:24.913
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND TO

01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:25.547
ADDRESS.

01:16:25.614 --> 01:16:27.883
MITIGATION MEASURES TO ADDRESS

01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:29.685
THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS --

01:16:29.751 --> 01:16:31.987
IT IS NOT A PROCESS THAT IS

01:16:32.054 --> 01:16:34.289
DESIGNED TO RECONCILE -- SCIENCE

01:16:34.356 --> 01:16:36.458
IN FACT THE COURT SPECIFICALLY

01:16:36.525 --> 01:16:37.893
ARE NOT PERMITTED TO WEIGH

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:40.329
EVIDENCE AND RECONCILE SCIENCE

01:16:40.395 --> 01:16:41.697
IN THE SECRET PROCESS EITHER TO

01:16:41.763 --> 01:16:42.731
TRIP TRIAL COURT OR THE

01:16:42.798 --> 01:16:44.333
APPELLATE COURT IS THE SAME

01:16:44.399 --> 01:16:45.567
STANDARD OF REVIEW.

01:16:45.634 --> 01:16:47.436
OF THE COURT MERELY LOOKS AT THE

01:16:47.502 --> 01:16:49.204
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT AND

01:16:49.271 --> 01:16:50.806
IF THERE'S ANY EVIDENCE IN THE

01:16:50.872 --> 01:16:52.708
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT TO

01:16:52.774 --> 01:16:53.976
SUPPORT.

01:16:54.042 --> 01:16:55.777
THE LEAD AGENCIES CONCLUSION FOR

01:16:55.844 --> 01:16:57.679
EXAMPLE THAT A PROJECT MAY

01:16:57.746 --> 01:16:59.614
PROCEED WITH THESE MITIGATION

01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:01.383
MEASURES THE COURT MAY NOT

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:03.752
CONSIDER ANY OTHER EVIDENCE

01:17:03.819 --> 01:17:06.822
THAT'S EMBEDDED IN THE I. R..

01:17:06.888 --> 01:17:07.823
EVEN IF IT'S MORE COMPELLING.

01:17:07.889 --> 01:17:08.323
THERE'S NO WEIGHING OF

01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:09.958
SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE IN FACT THAT

01:17:10.025 --> 01:17:12.060
POINT WAS CITED IN MADE VERY

01:17:12.127 --> 01:17:13.762
CLEAR IN THE COULD DISS OWN

01:17:13.829 --> 01:17:14.663
PUBLISHED.

01:17:14.730 --> 01:17:16.898
APPELLATE DECISION SO WHEN WE

01:17:16.965 --> 01:17:18.400
SAY SEEK FURTHER BEEN FIVE

01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:19.835
SEQUEL LAWSUITS AND SEEK WAS

01:17:19.901 --> 01:17:21.803
FULLY RESOLVED IN AND RECONCILE

01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:23.572
THESE ISSUES NOTHING COULD BE

01:17:23.638 --> 01:17:24.706
FURTHER THAN THE TRUTH IN FACT

01:17:24.773 --> 01:17:26.241
SEEK WITH DOES NOT PERMIT THAT

01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:28.510
SORT OF RECONCILIATION.

01:17:28.577 --> 01:17:30.012
AND NORMALLY.

01:17:30.078 --> 01:17:32.647
PERHAPS NINETY NINE POINT 9% OF

01:17:32.714 --> 01:17:34.483
THE TIME WHERE YOU HAVE A A LEAD

01:17:34.549 --> 01:17:36.752
AGENCY THAT SUBJECTIVE THAT'S OF

01:17:36.818 --> 01:17:38.587
A LOCAL CITY OR A COUNTY THAT

01:17:38.653 --> 01:17:40.455
WHERE THE ELECTED TO RESPONSIBLE

01:17:40.522 --> 01:17:41.857
TO CONSTITUENTS IN THE REGION

01:17:41.923 --> 01:17:44.826
WERE THAT LEAD AGENCY DOES THE

01:17:44.893 --> 01:17:46.561
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT.

01:17:46.628 --> 01:17:48.330
AND ATTEMPTS TO RECONCILE THE

01:17:48.397 --> 01:17:50.198
SCIENCE AND PICK THE BEST

01:17:50.265 --> 01:17:51.700
SCIENCE IN ORDER TO BASE THAT.

01:17:51.767 --> 01:17:53.435
ON WHICH TO BASE THE PROJECT YOU

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:55.137
DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM BUT WHERE

01:17:55.203 --> 01:17:57.539
YOU HAVE A LEAD AGENCY THAT HAS

01:17:57.606 --> 01:17:59.174
NO GROUND WATER.

01:17:59.241 --> 01:18:00.842
SANTA MARGARITA WATER DISTRICT.

01:18:00.909 --> 01:18:02.110
WHO HAS AN INTEREST IN THE

01:18:02.177 --> 01:18:05.047
PROJECT GETTING WATER?

01:18:05.113 --> 01:18:06.314
AND USES THE SCIENCE THAT

01:18:06.381 --> 01:18:08.183
SUPPORTS THAT AND I'M NOT

01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:09.351
SUGGESTING ANY.

01:18:09.418 --> 01:18:10.986
EVIL MOTIVE HERE.

01:18:11.053 --> 01:18:13.722
BUT IT YOU HAVE YOU CAN HAVE ANY --

01:18:13.789 --> 01:18:15.724
ARE THAT IS FLAWED WAS SCIENCE

01:18:15.791 --> 01:18:18.026
THAT IS NOT RECONCILED AND IF

01:18:18.093 --> 01:18:18.960
IT'S NOT RECONCILED IT COULD

01:18:19.027 --> 01:18:20.662
CAUSE SERIOUS DAMAGE AND THAT'S

01:18:20.729 --> 01:18:22.731
ESSENTIALLY THE CASE HERE.

01:18:22.798 --> 01:18:25.067
OKAY IT MAY I YEAH AND I LIKE

01:18:25.133 --> 01:18:26.601
THEIR FROM THE OPPOSITE BECAUSE

01:18:26.668 --> 01:18:27.202
IT WAS IT COULD I JUST WANT TO

01:18:27.269 --> 01:18:28.303
BE A LAWYER IN ON THIS THAT

01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:29.671
THERE WERE FOUR SEQUEL LAWSUITS.

01:18:29.738 --> 01:18:32.340
THERE WERE TWO LAWSUITS AGAINST

01:18:32.407 --> 01:18:33.241
THE COUNTY.

01:18:33.308 --> 01:18:34.142
UNDER ITS MANAGEMENT PLAN WE

01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:35.410
KEEP TALKING ABOUT SEEK WERE.

01:18:35.477 --> 01:18:37.345
IT WASN'T JUST SEQUEL.

01:18:37.412 --> 01:18:39.014
THERE WAS A SEQUEL PROCESS IN

01:18:39.081 --> 01:18:40.415
WHICH FINDINGS WERE MADE AND

01:18:40.482 --> 01:18:42.984
THEN THE COUNTY INDEPENDENTLY

01:18:43.051 --> 01:18:44.719
IMPOSED ITS OWN.

01:18:44.786 --> 01:18:46.188
ADDITIONAL MITIGATION MEASURES

01:18:46.254 --> 01:18:47.889
WHICH HAD THE INTENDED PURPOSE

01:18:47.956 --> 01:18:49.391
OF RECONCILING THE SAW THE THE

01:18:49.458 --> 01:18:52.127
SCIENCE BY CREATING A STOPPER.

01:18:52.194 --> 01:18:53.829
THEY PUT A FLOOR ON THE CHANGE

01:18:53.895 --> 01:18:55.430
IN ELEVATION IN THE GROUNDWATER

01:18:55.497 --> 01:18:57.099
TABLE SO REGARDLESS OF THE PUMP

01:18:57.165 --> 01:18:58.233
AGE.

01:18:58.300 --> 01:18:59.634
REGARDLESS OF THE RECHARGE.

01:18:59.701 --> 01:19:02.137
THE WATER TABLE COULD NOT CHANGE

01:19:02.204 --> 01:19:03.505
BY MORE THAN EIGHTY FEET.

01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:05.307
NOW THAT WAS WHAT WAS OF

01:19:05.373 --> 01:19:07.809
CHALLENGED IN COURT AND THAT WAS

01:19:07.876 --> 01:19:10.078
ALSO SUSTAIN IN COURT THIS IS

01:19:10.145 --> 01:19:14.382
NOT JUST TO SEE CORPORATE.

01:19:14.449 --> 01:19:15.817
MR LIKE I I THINK IS SOME ABOUT

01:19:15.884 --> 01:19:17.018
THIS I I THINK IT WHAT'S

01:19:17.085 --> 01:19:18.019
IMPORTANT TO GET BACK TO THE

01:19:18.086 --> 01:19:18.553
POINT.

01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:20.555
WE SENT MANY HOURS WITH THE

01:19:20.622 --> 01:19:22.491
AUTHOR OF THE SENATOR WHEN WE

01:19:22.557 --> 01:19:24.960
DON'T DISAGREED WITH HIS DESIRE

01:19:25.026 --> 01:19:26.228
TO HAVE A REVIEW OF THE SCIENCE.

01:19:26.294 --> 01:19:28.029
ALL WE WANT TO KNOW IS THAT AT

01:19:28.096 --> 01:19:29.264
THE END OF THE DAY.

01:19:29.331 --> 01:19:30.765
WE'RE GONNA KNOW THAT THAT

01:19:30.832 --> 01:19:32.334
REVIEW THE SCIENCE WAS

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:34.302
TRANSPARENT THAT RECONCILIATION

01:19:34.369 --> 01:19:35.937
IS TRANSPARENT.

01:19:36.004 --> 01:19:37.372
AND THAT INFANTS HE'S ME WE WE

01:19:37.439 --> 01:19:38.507
HAVE A MEMBER ASKING QUESTIONS

01:19:38.573 --> 01:19:40.809
SO WE'LL LET HIM FINISH ASKING

01:19:40.876 --> 01:19:42.144
US QUESTIONS.

01:19:42.210 --> 01:19:43.645
WELL I'D I'D LIKE THE MICHELIN'S

01:19:43.712 --> 01:19:45.614
RESPONSE THAT GOOD ON AS FAR AS

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:46.615
THE SCIENCE GOES I'M SORRY MADAM

01:19:46.681 --> 01:19:48.283
CHAIR I THOUGHT I WAS SPEAKING

01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:49.784
THROUGH TO THE SUPPLEMENT.

01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:50.952
I APOLOGIZE IF YOU WANT TO SPEAK

01:19:51.019 --> 01:19:56.091
TO HIS QUESTION ABOUT THE SEQUEL

01:19:56.158 --> 01:19:57.259
LAWSUIT THAT'S FINE.

01:19:57.325 --> 01:19:58.360
BUT NOT TO GET BACK ON TO YOUR

01:19:58.426 --> 01:20:00.128
POSITION ON THE BILL I THINK WE

01:20:00.195 --> 01:20:03.698
UNDERSTAND THAT OKAY.

01:20:03.765 --> 01:20:06.001
MR MATHIS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

01:20:06.067 --> 01:20:09.337
I'D I'D LOVE TO HEAR. ONE MISTER.

01:20:09.404 --> 01:20:11.173
LANG HAS TO TO ADD TO THE

01:20:11.239 --> 01:20:13.308
CONVERSATION THROUGH THROUGH THE

01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:14.876
CHAIR IF YOU.

01:20:14.943 --> 01:20:15.510
WHAT ELECTION ARE YOU ASKING HIM

01:20:15.577 --> 01:20:17.546
I?

01:20:17.612 --> 01:20:18.813
ON ON THE REVIEW PART OF THE

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:20.715
SCIENCE AND MY QUESTIONS GOT

01:20:20.782 --> 01:20:21.650
INTO YOU KNOW.

01:20:21.716 --> 01:20:24.252
WE'RE THERE'S DIFFERENT AREAS.

01:20:24.319 --> 01:20:25.987
THAT THIS PROJECT STUFF TO GO

01:20:26.054 --> 01:20:27.322
THROUGH WHERE THEY'RE GONNA

01:20:27.389 --> 01:20:28.423
DETERMINE DIFFERENT SCIENTIFIC

01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:29.191
PARTS.

01:20:29.257 --> 01:20:31.092
ON ON SIGNETICS SPECIALLY THAT

01:20:31.159 --> 01:20:31.960
THEY'RE GONNA GET INTO WHAT

01:20:32.027 --> 01:20:33.595
THAT'S ACTUALLY GONNA LOOK LIKE

01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:34.663
WILL BE OVER DRAFT.

01:20:34.729 --> 01:20:35.997
THERE'S ALREADY DECISION THAT

01:20:36.064 --> 01:20:38.800
SHOWS THAT WATER TABLE HAS TO BE

01:20:38.867 --> 01:20:40.135
WITHIN THE EIGHTY FEET.

01:20:40.202 --> 01:20:41.703
SO THAT'S ALREADY BUILT INTO

01:20:41.770 --> 01:20:42.804
THAT THAT ARE GOING TO THAT

01:20:42.871 --> 01:20:44.339
SIGMA DECISION.

01:20:44.406 --> 01:20:46.208
AND IF MISTER LANG HAS ANYTHING

01:20:46.274 --> 01:20:47.442
FOR PERTINENT AROUND THAT ARENA

01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:49.811
HAVE I WILL I KNOW I WOULD LIKE

01:20:49.878 --> 01:20:50.278
TO HEAR IT.

01:20:50.345 --> 01:20:52.480
AND SINCE YOU KNOW WE'VE.

01:20:52.547 --> 01:20:54.082
GOT DIFFERENT AMENDMENTS WE

01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:55.483
CLEARLY THERE ONE INITIAL

01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:56.585
SCIENTIFIC PROCESS HERE SO IF HE

01:20:56.651 --> 01:20:57.485
HAS ANYTHING.

01:20:57.552 --> 01:20:59.020
GERMANE TO THE SCIENTIFIC

01:20:59.087 --> 01:21:00.855
PROCESS A AND THEY COULD BE GOOD

01:21:00.922 --> 01:21:02.791
FOR THE COMMITTEE TO HEAR BUT

01:21:02.857 --> 01:21:03.725
OBVIOUSLY MADAM CHAIR NO THAT'S

01:21:03.792 --> 01:21:05.627
FINE I WASN'T SURE WHAT QUESTION

01:21:05.694 --> 01:21:06.261
YOU WANT TO SPEAK.

01:21:06.328 --> 01:21:06.895
SURE THEY WERE GETTING OFF TRACK

01:21:06.962 --> 01:21:08.630
WE'RE LOOKING FOR NEW TESTIMONY

01:21:08.697 --> 01:21:14.135
THIS IS A TIME FOR THE COMMITTEE

01:21:14.202 --> 01:21:15.103
TO DELIBERATE.

01:21:15.170 --> 01:21:16.371
ASK QUESTIONS THAT MAY HELP OR

01:21:16.438 --> 01:21:17.439
NOT AND AND IF THAT'S A WAY OF

01:21:17.505 --> 01:21:18.640
LEADING INTO ADDITIONAL

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:19.341
TESTIMONY THINK WERE.

01:21:19.407 --> 01:21:21.243
LONG PAST THAT -- AND THERE IS A

01:21:21.309 --> 01:21:22.377
MOTION AND A SECOND ON THE FLOOR

01:21:22.444 --> 01:21:23.345
OKAY IF YOU CAN BRIEFLY IF USE

01:21:23.411 --> 01:21:24.846
IF YOU'VE ANY NEW INFORMATION TO

01:21:24.913 --> 01:21:27.082
ADD ABOUT THE SITE THE THE THE

01:21:27.148 --> 01:21:29.618
RECONCILING OF THE SCIENCE ALL

01:21:29.684 --> 01:21:30.418
ALLOW THAT.

01:21:30.485 --> 01:21:31.853
I THINK THAT INTERSECTION

01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:32.487
EIGHTEEN TEN D. DOES REQUIRE A

01:21:32.554 --> 01:21:34.222
REVIEW OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:21:34.289 --> 01:21:36.491
IMPACTS OF A PROJECT.

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:37.959
WHAT WERE SIMPLY IN THAT CASE

01:21:38.026 --> 01:21:40.795
THE REVIEW ACTUALLY HAPPENS AT A

01:21:40.862 --> 01:21:42.864
PUBLIC TRANSPARENT WAY AND THE?

01:21:42.931 --> 01:21:45.100
THE THE DETERMINATION MADE IS

01:21:45.166 --> 01:21:47.636
DONE IN A PUBLIC WAY THAT'S WHAT

01:21:47.702 --> 01:21:49.437
WE'RE ASKING HERE IN THIS REVIEW

01:21:49.504 --> 01:21:51.072
IS IF A REVIEW IS DONE THAT IT

01:21:51.139 --> 01:21:51.606
BE.

01:21:51.673 --> 01:21:53.675
PUBLIC AND THAT THE BASIS OF

01:21:53.742 --> 01:21:57.445
THAT FINDING BE MADE PUBLIC AS

01:21:57.512 --> 01:21:59.447
WELL.

01:21:59.514 --> 01:22:00.615
OKAY THANK YOU MISS LIMóN.

01:22:00.682 --> 01:22:01.650
THANK YOU AND I DON'T WANT TO BE

01:22:01.716 --> 01:22:02.250
REPETITIVE SO THAT WHAT I'M

01:22:02.317 --> 01:22:04.152
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT

01:22:04.219 --> 01:22:05.453
THIS CONVERSATION HAS BEEN

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:08.857

HE DOES ALARM THE A LITTLE BIT

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:26.508

YOU KNOW DAYS BEFORE THE VOTE IF

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:39.921
UNDERSTAND THAT.

01:22:39.988 --> 01:22:41.756
MANAGER OF JULY REPRESENTING

01:22:41.823 --> 01:22:42.023
KIDDIES.

01:22:42.090 --> 01:22:42.691
WE'VE HAD A VARIETY OF

01:22:42.757 --> 01:22:44.059
DISCUSSIONS WE HAD A VERY

01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:45.493
THOROUGH HEARING IN DISCUSSION

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:47.062
OF POTENTIAL MOMENTS BACK IN THE

01:22:47.128 --> 01:22:48.330
SENATE NATURAL RESOURCES

01:22:48.396 --> 01:22:50.498
COMMITTEE EARLIER THIS YEAR

01:22:50.565 --> 01:22:51.933
ABOUT SIX WEEKS AGO -- WE

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.234
DISCUSSED MANY AMENDMENTS AT

01:22:53.301 --> 01:22:55.103
THAT POINT WE HAVE SINCE HAD

01:22:55.170 --> 01:22:56.504
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE SENATOR.

01:22:56.571 --> 01:22:59.074
THIS IS SORT OF BEEN A A LITTLE

01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:00.475
BIT OF A MOVING TARGET AND A AND

01:23:00.542 --> 01:23:03.545
A WORK IN PROGRESS QUITE FRANKLY

01:23:03.611 --> 01:23:04.846
WITH THE SENATOR.

01:23:04.913 --> 01:23:06.114
AS WE HAVE GONE A LONG WE HAVE

01:23:06.181 --> 01:23:07.982
IT HAD TRIED TO NARROW THE

01:23:08.049 --> 01:23:08.817
AMENDMENTS.

01:23:08.883 --> 01:23:10.051
WE DON'T BELIEVE STATE LANDS

01:23:10.118 --> 01:23:11.619
COMMISSION IS THE APPROPRIATE

01:23:11.686 --> 01:23:12.954
AGENCY THEY DON'T HAVE THE

01:23:13.021 --> 01:23:15.824
EXPERIENCE FOR EXAMPLE AND AND

01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:17.892
THE ABILITY TO DO THIS BUT WITH

01:23:17.959 --> 01:23:18.760
THE SENATORS.

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:20.261
STRONG FEELINGS THAT THAT IS THE

01:23:20.328 --> 01:23:23.031
RIGHT AGENCY WE DECIDED OKAY

01:23:23.098 --> 01:23:24.199
LET'S NARROW OR AMENDMENTS

01:23:24.265 --> 01:23:26.901
DIRECTLY TO THE PROCESS SO THAT

01:23:26.968 --> 01:23:29.771
WHATEVER AGENCY DOES IS REVIEW

01:23:29.838 --> 01:23:31.039
THAT THERE ARE PUBLIC HEARINGS

01:23:31.106 --> 01:23:32.273
THAT IT'S TRANSPARENT.

01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:34.042
AND THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY

01:23:34.109 --> 01:23:35.176
THAT.

01:23:35.243 --> 01:23:36.945
THE FINDINGS THE BASIS OF THOSE

01:23:37.011 --> 01:23:39.114
FINDINGS BE PUBLIC SO THAT WE

01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:41.816
CAN KNOW THEM SO THAT THE

01:23:41.883 --> 01:23:42.751
OPPONENTS CAN KNOW THEM.

01:23:42.817 --> 01:23:43.485
THAT'S WHY WE LIKE THE WORD

01:23:43.551 --> 01:23:45.620
DETERMINATION BECAUSE THAT MEANS

01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:47.889
THAT IT IS A DETERMINATION BOUND

01:23:47.956 --> 01:23:48.823
BY.

01:23:48.890 --> 01:23:51.292
FINDINGS AND FACTS THAT ARE THE

01:23:51.359 --> 01:23:53.795
BASIS OF THAT DETERMINATION SO

01:23:53.862 --> 01:23:56.030
SO WE HAVE NARROWED I REQUEST

01:23:56.097 --> 01:23:58.166
YES IT'S IT'S FOR PUBLIC TO SAY

01:23:58.233 --> 01:24:00.802
A SUPPLEMENT ASSEMBLY WILL MOVE

01:24:00.869 --> 01:24:00.969
OUT.

01:24:01.035 --> 01:24:01.803
OF ME -- NOT OUT OF THE FACT

01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:04.038
THAT WE FEEL STRONGER THAT THE

01:24:04.105 --> 01:24:05.240
STATE LANDS COMMISSION IS THE

01:24:05.306 --> 01:24:07.475
APPROPRIATE AGENCY BECAUSE WE

01:24:07.542 --> 01:24:08.009
DON'T THINK THEY HAVE THE

01:24:08.076 --> 01:24:09.844
EXPERTISE BUT IN AN ATTEMPT TO

01:24:09.911 --> 01:24:11.513
TRY AND REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH

01:24:11.579 --> 01:24:16.117
THE SENATOR AND THE PROPONENTS

01:24:16.184 --> 01:24:16.718
OF THE BILL WE HAVE NARROWED I

01:24:16.785 --> 01:24:17.419
REQUEST.

01:24:17.485 --> 01:24:18.186
AND IS IT NOT THE CASE THAT

01:24:18.253 --> 01:24:19.454
STATE LANDS REVIEW THE PUBLIC

01:24:19.521 --> 01:24:25.660
LANDS.

01:24:25.727 --> 01:24:26.294
WE ARE VERY WE HEARD WE HOPE YES

01:24:26.361 --> 01:24:27.295
WE WE HOPE THAT THE IDEA WOULD

01:24:27.362 --> 01:24:34.302
BE IS THAT THE THE BOXES UNLESS

01:24:34.369 --> 01:24:36.104
THE APPLICANT.

01:24:36.171 --> 01:24:37.572
PROVIDE CARRIES THE BURDEN OF

01:24:37.639 --> 01:24:37.772
PROOF.

01:24:37.839 --> 01:24:39.107
SO [inaudible]

01:24:39.174 --> 01:24:41.209
THANK YOU.

01:24:41.276 --> 01:24:42.977
THANK YOU MISTER FLOOR.

01:24:43.044 --> 01:24:44.379
THANK YOU A SENATOR HAVE

01:24:44.446 --> 01:24:45.647
PROCEDURE TIME I KNOW THIS BILL

01:24:45.713 --> 01:24:46.781
HAS NOT BEEN EASY FOR A LOT OF

01:24:46.848 --> 01:24:48.716
PEOPLE AND IN MY MAJOR CONCERN

01:24:48.783 --> 01:24:50.185
WITH THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION

01:24:50.251 --> 01:24:51.419
IS QUITE FRANKLY THE PRECEDENT

01:24:51.486 --> 01:24:52.620
THAT SETS.

01:24:52.687 --> 01:24:55.023
WATER IS IS VITAL TO MY DISTRICT

01:24:55.089 --> 01:24:56.491
AND IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE

01:24:56.558 --> 01:24:58.460
REVIEWS LIKE THIS CONSTANTLY

01:24:58.526 --> 01:24:59.027
WHEN PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE

01:24:59.093 --> 01:25:01.396
OUTCOME -- I THINK THE PRESIDENT

01:25:01.463 --> 01:25:03.631
IS TREMENDOUS SO I AM CURIOUS SO

01:25:03.698 --> 01:25:04.566
YOU KNOW.

01:25:04.632 --> 01:25:05.667
WHAT XPECTS REDUCES THE STATE

01:25:05.733 --> 01:25:06.768
LANDS COMMISSION HAVE ON

01:25:06.835 --> 01:25:08.403
GROUNDWATER ISSUES AND I THINK

01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:10.038
WE CAN HEARD THAT MAYBE NOT A

01:25:10.104 --> 01:25:11.105
LOT?

01:25:11.172 --> 01:25:12.674
THEN WHY DID WE DECIDE THAT THEY

01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:13.908
SHOULD LEAVE THE EFFORTS WHEN WE

01:25:13.975 --> 01:25:15.710
HAVE A STATE WATER RESOURCE

01:25:15.777 --> 01:25:17.479
BOARD OR D. W. ARE THOSE OF THE

01:25:17.545 --> 01:25:18.646
PROFESSIONALS THAT RELATE TO

01:25:18.713 --> 01:25:19.781
THIS ISSUE.

01:25:19.848 --> 01:25:21.082
AS A WE START TALKING ABOUT

01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:22.617
SIGMA WHICH IS GONNA HAVE A

01:25:22.684 --> 01:25:25.286
DRASTIC EFFECT ON MY DISTRICT.

01:25:25.353 --> 01:25:26.855
IF EVERYTHING THAT WE GO THROUGH

01:25:26.921 --> 01:25:28.756
WITH THE D. W. R. AND THE WATER

01:25:28.823 --> 01:25:29.591
BOARD.

01:25:29.657 --> 01:25:30.925
MY CONSTITUENTS ARE NOW

01:25:30.992 --> 01:25:32.093
POTENTIALLY GOING TO HAVE TO

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:33.261
HAVE A THIRD.

01:25:33.328 --> 01:25:36.130
AGENCY LOOKING DOWN THEIR THROAT.

01:25:36.197 --> 01:25:37.732
ON EVERY WATER PLAN THAT THEY

01:25:37.799 --> 01:25:39.767
PROPOSE.

01:25:39.834 --> 01:25:41.836
IT'S A HUGE CONCERN OF OURS

01:25:41.903 --> 01:25:43.671
BECAUSE THIS BILL.

01:25:43.738 --> 01:25:45.573
SEEMS TO HAVE GONE THROUGH.

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:45.740
ALL.

01:25:45.807 --> 01:25:47.308
THE RED TAPE.

01:25:47.375 --> 01:25:49.210
TIME AND TIME AGAIN HELD UP IN

01:25:49.277 --> 01:25:51.880
COURT MULTIPLE TIMES.

01:25:51.946 --> 01:25:54.315
WE SAID IN THIS COMMITTEE A LOT.

01:25:54.382 --> 01:25:56.017
TALKING ABOUT.

01:25:56.084 --> 01:25:58.119
REDUCING SEEK WHAT.

01:25:58.186 --> 01:25:59.320
MAKING SURE WE FAST TRACK

01:25:59.387 --> 01:26:00.889
PROJECTS.

01:26:00.955 --> 01:26:03.558
NOT THIS BILL NOT THIS PROJECT.

01:26:03.625 --> 01:26:04.158
THIS PROJECT HAS GONE THROUGH

01:26:04.225 --> 01:26:05.527
ALL.

01:26:05.593 --> 01:26:08.596
AND YET IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH.

01:26:08.663 --> 01:26:10.064
SO REALLY COMES DOWN TO ONE

01:26:10.131 --> 01:26:12.634
THING FOR ME IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE

01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:14.235
THE OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL.

01:26:14.302 --> 01:26:16.104
SIMPLY DON'T LIKE THE OUTCOME.

01:26:16.170 --> 01:26:17.372
AND THEY'RE DOING WHATEVER THEY

01:26:17.438 --> 01:26:19.140
CAN TO PUT A DEATH KNELL IN THIS

01:26:19.207 --> 01:26:20.909
PARTICULAR PROJECT.

01:26:20.975 --> 01:26:22.510
AND THAT IS A HUGE CONCERN OF

01:26:22.577 --> 01:26:23.311
MINE.

01:26:23.378 --> 01:26:25.280
BECAUSE IF THESE PROJECTS IN THE

01:26:25.346 --> 01:26:27.148
SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE DO

01:26:27.215 --> 01:26:28.850
NOT MOVE FORWARD.

01:26:28.917 --> 01:26:31.219
AND WE CANNOT FIND A STATE WIDE

01:26:31.286 --> 01:26:33.254
WATER FIX.

01:26:33.321 --> 01:26:34.756
ALL THINGS HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED

01:26:34.822 --> 01:26:35.723
IN THIS.

01:26:35.790 --> 01:26:37.458
WE ARE GOING TO RUN OUT OF WATER

01:26:37.525 --> 01:26:39.427
WE CAN'T BUILD RESERVOIRS.

01:26:39.494 --> 01:26:40.895
WE CAN'T BUILD CONVEYANCE

01:26:40.962 --> 01:26:41.863
SYSTEMS.

01:26:41.930 --> 01:26:43.831
WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

01:26:43.898 --> 01:26:46.434
RIGHT NOW WE ARE AT LOCKED WITH

01:26:46.501 --> 01:26:48.036
THIS ISSUE.

01:26:48.102 --> 01:26:50.939
AND THIS IS JUST ONE MORE --

01:26:51.005 --> 01:26:52.807
PROJECT THAT I'M SEEING THAT HAS

01:26:52.874 --> 01:26:54.108
GONE THROUGH IT ALL.

01:26:54.175 --> 01:26:56.377
THAT WE'RE GONNA KILL.

01:26:56.444 --> 01:26:57.445
AS THEY WERE GOING TO KILL

01:26:57.512 --> 01:26:58.746
BECAUSE THERE'S A SERIES OF

01:26:58.813 --> 01:27:00.682
EMAILS THAT ARE OUT THERE.

01:27:00.748 --> 01:27:01.616
BETWEEN THE STATE.

01:27:01.683 --> 01:27:02.984
LANDS COMMISSION WITH THE

01:27:03.051 --> 01:27:04.953
OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL.

01:27:05.019 --> 01:27:06.621
THEY SHOW A CLEAR BIAS WHAT

01:27:06.688 --> 01:27:07.589
THEIR INTENTIONS ARE WHEN THIS

01:27:07.655 --> 01:27:09.857
BILL COMES.

01:27:09.924 --> 01:27:11.593
AND I'VE GOT THE EMAILS AND WE'D

01:27:11.659 --> 01:27:12.160
BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SHARE

01:27:12.226 --> 01:27:13.027
THOSE WITH YOU.

01:27:13.094 --> 01:27:14.395
BUT THIS IS A HUGE CONCERN WHEN

01:27:14.462 --> 01:27:15.530
YOU HAVE A GOVERNMENT

01:27:15.597 --> 01:27:17.265
BUREAUCRACY.

01:27:17.332 --> 01:27:19.100
ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN KILLING A

01:27:19.167 --> 01:27:20.768
PRIVATE PROJECT THAT CAN ONLY

01:27:20.835 --> 01:27:22.403
BENEFIT THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE

01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:23.571
STATE AND IF IT DOES NOT GO

01:27:23.638 --> 01:27:25.340
THROUGH.

01:27:25.406 --> 01:27:28.109
IT FALLS BACK ON MY CONSTITUENTS.

01:27:28.176 --> 01:27:29.944
FALLS BACK ON OUR AREA.

01:27:30.011 --> 01:27:31.279
AND ARE CONVEYANCE DOWN THERE.

01:27:31.346 --> 01:27:33.047
WE HAVE TO TAKE AN HONEST LOOK

01:27:33.114 --> 01:27:35.550
AT WATER AND WE MUST.

01:27:35.617 --> 01:27:37.318
HAVE AN ENTIRE STATEWIDE WATER

01:27:37.385 --> 01:27:39.554

01:27:39.621 --> 01:27:41.289

01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:42.724
A WHILE.

01:27:42.790 --> 01:27:44.258
BUT IF WE DO NOT GET THIS BILL

01:27:44.325 --> 01:27:46.227
RIGHT AND THIS IS THE PRESIDENT

01:27:46.294 --> 01:27:47.328

WE'RE NOT REGULATORS.

01:27:53.167 --> 01:27:55.003
OKAY OUR JOB IS TO LEGISLATE AND

01:27:55.069 --> 01:27:58.072
LET THOSE FOLKS DO THEIR JOB.

01:27:58.139 --> 01:27:59.507

01:27:59.574 --> 01:28:00.508

01:28:19.427 --> 01:28:20.662
TO DO WITH SIGMA.

01:28:20.728 --> 01:28:22.196
THERE IS NO SIGNUP PROCESS

01:28:22.263 --> 01:28:23.831
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROJECT TO

01:28:23.898 --> 01:28:25.400
MY KNOWLEDGE AND IF SOMEONE'S

01:28:25.466 --> 01:28:26.934
ANALYSIS REFLECTS THAT THEN I

01:28:27.001 --> 01:28:28.036

01:28:28.102 --> 01:28:29.237
AND FIGURE OUT.

01:28:29.303 --> 01:28:30.538
THE BASIS FOR THE STATEMENTS IN

01:28:30.605 --> 01:28:32.073
THE ANALYSIS BECAUSE SIGNET

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:33.841
SIMPLY DOES NOT APPLY AS COULD

01:28:33.908 --> 01:28:35.510

APPELLATE DECISION.

01:28:40.548 --> 01:28:42.650
NUMBER ONE TWO WITH RESPECT TO

01:28:42.717 --> 01:28:44.819
OTHER PROJECTS I SUPPOSE IF

01:28:44.886 --> 01:28:46.554
THEY'RE IN THE MOJAVE.

01:28:46.621 --> 01:28:48.322
YOU NEED TO BE CONCERNED.

01:28:48.389 --> 01:28:50.725
IF SOME OF US WHO HAVE VIEWS

01:28:50.792 --> 01:28:54.762
ABOUT THE MOJAVE -- ARE CORRECT.

01:28:54.829 --> 01:28:56.964
AND IF THE BILL PASSES PROJECTS

01:28:57.031 --> 01:28:58.132
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECTS

01:28:58.199 --> 01:29:00.401
IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY PROJECTS IN

01:29:00.468 --> 01:29:01.969
LOS ANGELES COUNTY.

01:29:02.036 --> 01:29:04.305
ARE NOT IMPACTED BY THIS UNLESS

01:29:04.372 --> 01:29:05.640
THEY HAPPEN TO BE ON THE COAST

01:29:05.707 --> 01:29:07.341
IN WHICH CASE YOU HAVE THE

01:29:07.408 --> 01:29:08.543
COASTAL COMMISSION TO DEAL WITH.

01:29:08.609 --> 01:29:10.278
I'VE I'VE ATTEMPTED TO OUTLINE

01:29:10.344 --> 01:29:11.879
THE THE THE ISSUES ASSOCIATED

01:29:11.946 --> 01:29:13.114
WITH THE SECRET PROCESS IN THIS

01:29:13.181 --> 01:29:14.982
CASE IN THE AND THE ISSUE SIMPLE

01:29:15.049 --> 01:29:16.517
YOUR THE COURT CAN'T RESOLVE THE

01:29:16.584 --> 01:29:18.286
SCIENCE AND IS NOT AUTHORIZED TO

01:29:18.352 --> 01:29:19.954
BY LAW UNDER THE STANDARD TO

01:29:20.021 --> 01:29:20.755
REVIEW.

01:29:20.822 --> 01:29:22.156
NOW WE COULD ASK WHY COULD THESE

01:29:22.223 --> 01:29:24.459
AND ALL OF THE YEARS THAT WE'VE

01:29:24.525 --> 01:29:25.593
BEEN DOING THIS.

01:29:25.660 --> 01:29:27.261
WHY KIDDIES HAS NOT ATTEMPTED TO

01:29:27.328 --> 01:29:29.964
RECONCILE THE SCIENCE ITSELF?

01:29:30.031 --> 01:29:30.932
IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT THERE'S

01:29:30.998 --> 01:29:33.167
BEEN NO ATTEMPT TO RECONCILE THE

01:29:33.234 --> 01:29:34.869
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIFTY

01:29:34.936 --> 01:29:38.005
THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER YEAR AND

01:29:38.072 --> 01:29:38.606
TWO TO TEN THOUSAND ACRE FEET

01:29:38.673 --> 01:29:40.708
PER YEAR OR THIRTY TWO THOUSAND

01:29:40.775 --> 01:29:40.908
ACRE.

01:29:40.975 --> 01:29:42.310
FEET PER YEAR INTO THAT OR TO

01:29:42.376 --> 01:29:43.778
PROTECT TEN THOUSAND ACRE FEET

01:29:43.845 --> 01:29:44.679
PER YEAR.

01:29:44.746 --> 01:29:46.314
ALL I'M TRYING TO DO IS GET IT

01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:47.715
RIGHT BECAUSE I THINK THE

01:29:47.782 --> 01:29:49.016
CONSEQUENCES OF FAILING TO GET A

01:29:49.083 --> 01:29:49.650
RIGHT.

01:29:49.717 --> 01:29:50.852
ARE NOT GOING TO IMPACT THE

01:29:50.918 --> 01:29:52.386
CENTRAL VALLEY HAVE NOTHING TO

01:29:52.453 --> 01:29:54.021
DO WITH SIGMA ARE NOT GOING TO

01:29:54.088 --> 01:29:56.924
CHANGE SEEK WE EVEN FOR SOME OF

01:29:56.991 --> 01:29:58.092
US WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE SEQUEL.

01:29:58.159 --> 01:29:59.527
BUT ARE GOING TO PROTECT THE

01:29:59.594 --> 01:30:01.028
MOJAVE AND THAT'S WHAT I'M

01:30:01.095 --> 01:30:04.132
CONCERNED ABOUT.

01:30:04.198 --> 01:30:05.099
MR.

01:30:05.166 --> 01:30:06.801
FOR AND I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT

01:30:06.868 --> 01:30:08.436
THIS PRESIDENT.

01:30:08.503 --> 01:30:08.970
IS IS THE PART THAT I'M

01:30:09.036 --> 01:30:10.738
CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE PRESIDENT

01:30:10.805 --> 01:30:12.073
THAT WE'RE SITTING HERE YEAH

01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:13.141
THERE MAY NOT BE A PARTICULAR

01:30:13.207 --> 01:30:14.742
PROJECT.

01:30:14.809 --> 01:30:17.445
BUT IF WE DON'T LIKE A PROJECT

01:30:17.512 --> 01:30:18.045
THAT GOES THROUGH ALL OF THE

01:30:18.112 --> 01:30:21.048
DIFFERENT -- REVIEWS. FOR THAT

01:30:21.115 --> 01:30:23.551
THE STATE HAS SET UP.

01:30:23.618 --> 01:30:25.653
AND THEN IT GETS THE GREEN LIGHT

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:27.054
TO GO AND THEN WE TAKE ANOTHER

01:30:27.121 --> 01:30:28.222
BITE AT THE APPLE THAT'S MY

01:30:28.289 --> 01:30:29.724
CONCERN.

01:30:29.791 --> 01:30:31.225
IS THAT THIS THINKING DOES GET

01:30:31.292 --> 01:30:33.227
HELD UP IN BOTTLED UP TIME AND

01:30:33.294 --> 01:30:35.196
TIME AND TIME AGAIN TO THE CLOCK

01:30:35.263 --> 01:30:36.931
RESETS AND WE'RE STARTED ALL

01:30:36.998 --> 01:30:37.865
OVER AGAIN.

01:30:37.932 --> 01:30:39.167
AND GUESS WHAT STILL HAPPENING.

01:30:39.233 --> 01:30:41.135
WE STILL DON'T HAVE WATER.

01:30:41.202 --> 01:30:42.436
WE'RE STILL NOT CONVEYING WATER

01:30:42.503 --> 01:30:43.604
WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO.

01:30:43.671 --> 01:30:45.406
AND SO WHAT THIS IS TO ME IS

01:30:45.473 --> 01:30:47.575
JUST A A BUNCH OF BUREAUCRATIC

01:30:47.642 --> 01:30:49.944
RED TAPE DESIGNED TO SLOW

01:30:50.011 --> 01:30:51.245
