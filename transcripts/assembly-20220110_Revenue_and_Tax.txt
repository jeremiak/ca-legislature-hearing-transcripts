FINALLY FIVE BILLS HAVE BEEN PAROLED FROM TODAY'S AGENDA THESE BILLS ARE FILE ITEM FIVE AB TWO FORTY EIGHT CHOI FILE ITEM SEVEN AB TWO FIFTY FILE ITEM NINE AB EIGHT THIRTY FOUR FILE FIFTEEN AB ELEVEN TWENTY ONE AND FILE SIXTEEN. BUT ITEM SIXTEEN AB NINETY ONE I WANT TO THANK THOSE AUTHORS FOR UNDERSTANDING AND FOR REMOVING THEIR BILLS. LET'S SEE. WE DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM YET. I SERVICES SUBCOMMITTEE WHILE WE START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE- A DOCTOR ARAMBULA FILE ITEM ONE EIGHT SIX SEVEN I UNDERSTAND THEIR TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES YOU HAVE THEM HERE WITH YOU ARE THEY ON THE PHONE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. EIGHT OH SEVEN WILL PROVIDE LICENSED NON HOSPITAL BLOOD BLOOD BANKS THE SALES AND USE TAX EXEMPTION ON LABORATORY EQUIPMENT AND CHEMICAL REAGENTS. USED TO TEST VOLUNTARILY DONATED HUMAN BLOOD THAT IMPOSES SALES TAX ON BLOOD DONOR TESTING REAGENTS EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES. ONLY TWO DONOR TESTING LABORATORIES REMAIN OPERATIONAL IN THE STATE THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA BLOOD CENTER IN FRESNO AND THE STANFORD BLOOD CENTER IN PALO ALTO. ALL OTHER BLOOD BANKS IN CALIFORNIA SEND THEIR SUPPLIES TO AN OUT OF STATE LABORATORY FOR TESTING. CURRENT LAW EXEMPTS SALES TAX FROM MOST OF THE PRODUCTS AND EQUIPMENT USED TO COLLECT BLOOD DONATION. THIS BILL SEEKS TO FURTHER EXAMS A QUICK MEANT CHEMICALS AND REAGENTS AND QUALITY CONTROL MATERIALS THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY REQUIRED TO PERFORM BOTH FTA AND CALIFORNIA MANDATED SCREENING TEST. THIS BILL ALSO DECLARES THE GOAL OF INCENTIVIZING OTHER BLOOD CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA TO TEST THEIR OWN BLOOD DONATIONS ANTS TO MOTIVATE TESTING FACILITIES TO LOCATE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I AM JOINED TODAY WITH TWO WITNESSES WHO WILL BE TESTIFYING REMOTELY IN SUPPORT OF AB SIX OH SEVEN CHRISTOPHER STOP WITH THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA BLOOD CENTER AND HARPREET SANDHU WITH THE STANFORD BLOOD CENTER. BUT BEFORE WE BEGIN THE WITNESS TESTIMONY MADAM CHAIR WILL YIELD THE REST OF THE TIME TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON WHO IS A JOINT AUTHOR ON THIS IMPORTANT MATTER. MISTER BENSON THANK YOU A MEMBER RANDY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ALONG SIDE YOU AT THIS IS A VERY DEBAYLE. TO ME AT TO FRESNO AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY BLOOD CENTER PARTICULARLY. SHARON AND I HAVE BEEN BLOOD DONORS THERE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME SHARING PARTICULARLY HAD THE KIND OF BLOOD NECESSARY FOR- THE ELLER FAMILY WHO DIRECTED AND REALLY BUILT THE- FRESNO BLOOD CENTER TO WHERE IT IS TODAY- AND SHE- EVENTUALLY PASSED. BUT WE LIVED VERY CLOSE AND PERSONALLY TO THE CONSEQUENCES- OF BLOOD DISEASE HAND THE NECESSITY FOR BLOOD DONATION AND OBVIOUSLY FOR TESTING. AND SO THEY PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND IT'S VITAL FOR BLOOD CENTERS TO REMAIN VIABLE THIS IS A ONE WAY. TO HELP DO THAT AS A SENTIMENT ARAMBULA ALREADY MENTIONED ONLY TWO NON HOSPITAL BLOOD BANKS IN THE STATE TEST THEIR DONATED BLOOD IN HOUSE PART OF THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE COST OF DOING SO IN CALIFORNIA. CURRENT LAW ALREADY EXEMPTS HAS BEEN MENTIONED SALES TAX FOR MANY OF THE PRODUCTS AND EQUIPMENT USED TO COLLECT DONATED BLOOD YET THE EXEMPTION DOES NOT EXTEND TO LAB EQUIPMENT MATERIALS NEEDED TO TEST THIS DONATED BLOOD. SB SIX OH SEVEN IS A REASONABLE EXTENSION OF CURRENT LAW WOULD ALLOW CENTRAL VALLEY BLOOD CENTER AS WELL AS THE STANFORD BLOOD CENTER TO CONTINUE DOING THEIR TESTING IN HOUSE RATHER THAN HAVING TO SEND THE COLLECTED DONATIONS OUT OF STATE TO BE TESTED. ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUE- NUMBER RIGHT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR ITEMS SURE. THANK YOU BOTH- WITH THE MODERATOR. CONNECT US NOW WITH THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA BLOOD CENTER CHRISTOPHER STOP PLEASE.

SUCH AS THE CAMERA BUTTON TWENTY TWO THOUSAND ONE WHEN GROUND AND AIR TRAVEL WAS EXTREMELY RESTRICTED SAMPLE OULD NOT MAKE IT TO THE DESIGNATED TESTING LAB IN THAT SCENARIO. WHILE OUR LABS ARE NOT BUILT FOR LARGE VOLUME WE WOULD DEFINITELY BE ABLE TO HANDLE BETWEEN OUR TWO LABORATORIES THE TESTING ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO ALLOW THE MOST CRITICAL BLOOD PRODUCTS TO BE TESTED AND RELEASED TO ENSURE PATIENT SAFETY IS NOT COMPROMISED. AND WITH THE HELP OF THE EXEMPTION DESCRIBED AND BILL- INNISFAIL- WE CAN TEND TO KEEP OUR DONOR TESTING LAB IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF OPERATIONS FOR THE GOOD OF OUR PATIENTS OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY.

IT AIMS TO DO THIS BY ENCOURAGING QUALIFIED VENDORS TO MAKE THESE SORTS A LOANS ON A VERY TARGETED BASIS TO SMALLER FIRMS.

ACCORDING TO THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA 56% SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE EXPERIENCED LARGE NEGATIVE EFFECTS FROM THE PANDEMIC. 95% OF THESE BUSINESSES ARE SMALL BUSINESSES WITH FEWER THAN FIFTY EMPLOYEES. IN A RECENT SURVEY OF OUR OWN I FOUND THAT 72% OF RESPONDENTS BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY IMPACTED. THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC BEGAN. BUT THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC PUBLIC INVESTMENT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOLEY MENTIONED. FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE STATE HAS TRIED TO ALLEVIATE OSTS FOR BUSINESSES BY PROVIDING GRANT AND LOAN OPPORTUNITIES HOWEVER. ONLY 46% OF SMALL BUSINESSES APPLIED. FOR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE IN CALIFORNIA THROUGH PPP AND ONLY 17% RECEIVE WHAT THEY REQUESTED. AND WE KNOW FROM MULTIPLE SURVEYS THAT ACCESS THE CAPITAL IS A TOP PRIORITY CONCERNS SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND OPERATORS. AND IN THE SPECIALLY IMPORTANT AND SMALL BUSINESSES SEEK TO BUILD BACK. AB EIGHT TWENTY PROVIDE SMALL BUSINESSES MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO SEEK LENDING CONFIDENTIAL INSTITUTIONS BY CLAMPING. FROM TAXATION INTEREST REVENUE.

MY NAME IS DIANE ROGERS MY SERVED AS THE PRESIDENT CEO RANCHO CORDOVA AREA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS. I CAN SAY WITHOUT A DOUBT NOTHING DURING MY TENURE HAS IMPACTED SMALL BUSINESS MORE THAN THE LOCKDOWNS RESTRICTIONS AND ECONOMIC CONTRACT CONTRACTION ASSOCIATED WITH CODE NINETEEN.

EIGHTY EIGHT TWENTY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AT THE TIME THERE'S IN Q. THANK YOU TO HAVING ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE MR COOLEY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YES INDEED I THANK YOU I THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL I THINK IT IS ACTUALLY. TRYING TO ADDRESS FACTS THAT HAVE EMERGED DURING COVERT. THERE IS THE ECONOMIC EFFECT OF COVERT WHICH HAS SHOWN A VERY TERRIBLE PERSISTENCY AS AFFECTING SMALL BUSINESS. THERE WAS AN EFFORT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO TRY TO CREATE THE PPP LONG PROGRAM. THERE IS ISSUES WITH THAT TAKE UP RATE ACTUALLY BECAUSE- LOCAL BUSINESSES HAVE TROUBLE FIGURING OUT WHO LOCAL IN THEIR MARKET COULD GIVE ALONE OF DOUBT ABOUT THE- ROLE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO COME IN AND ACCOUNT THE ACCOUNT FOR THOSE FUNDS. SO THERE'S HESITANCY TO TAKE UP THOSE LOANS THIS BILL BY WORK OF LOCAL LENDERS GIVE SMALL BUSINESSES A CHANNEL FOR SMALLER BUSINESSES TO ACCESS CAPITAL FROM KNOWN LENDERS. AND IT IS VERY NARROW IN ITS IMPACT IN TERMS OF TYPES OF LOANS AND CUTS WITH THE TAX LOSS. I THINK IT IS. RESPONSIVE TO THE CURRENT CRISIS BUT ALSO RESPONSIVE TO THE DEFECTS IN HOUSE ON THE FEDERAL FUNDS. OPERATED THE FACT IS OF LIMITED DURATION AND ALL THE FOLLOW UP STUDIES WILL.

TWELVE FORTY NINE I WHICH WOULD CLARIFY CALIFORNIA'S TAX CODE TO EXCLUDE ALL TYPES OF CLAIMANTS FROM PAIN STATE TAXES ON COMPENSATIONFOR DAM OF THE VALE OUT OF P. GENIES FIRE VICTIMS TRUST. HI THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION TO ENSURE THAT THOSE WHO. LOST THEIR HOMES THEIR PROPERTY THEIR LIVES THEIR LOVED ONES- WHEN THEY RECEIVE THEIR SETTLEMENT FROM P. GENIE OUT OF THE CAMP FIRE- AND SEVERAL OTHER FIRES FROM- THESE PAST YEARS. THAT THAT THAT WOULD NOT BE TAX AND THAT WOULD BE A HUGE BENEFIT FOR THEM- AS- MANY OF THEM ARE THERE MAYBE NOT GETTING- YOU KNOW FULL COMPENSATION- OUT OF THIS- NOW THIS SETTLEMENT- SO THIS WOULD GO A LONG WAY TO HELPING THEM RECOVER TO REBUILD HOMES TO REBUILD THEIR LIVES- AND THIS DEVASTATING TIME- AND SO I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. AND I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR ALL OF YOUR HELP- AND YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE AND FOR YOUR YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF AND WORKING WITH US- THIS IS A BIPARTISAN BILL AND HOPE WE CAN MOVE IT FOR TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE TO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT FIRST- ANGELA KASLER MODERATOR WOULD YOU PLEASE CONNECT US. YES I'M CONNECTED CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. HI THERE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE ON ANGELA KAPLER FROM THE PARADISE CAMPFIRE AND THERE ARE CURRENTLY THREE TAXABLE PORTIONS TO THAT FIRE VICTIMS TRUST SETTLEMENT ONE IS EMOTIONAL DISTRESS PERSONAL INCOME AND BUSINESS INCOME. MOST CLAIMS WILL HAVE EITHER OR BOTH AN EMOTIONAL DISTRESS OR DON'T DANGER DETERMINATION AND CURRENTLY PRELIMINARY PAYMENTS ARE BEING DISTRIBUTED WILDFIRE VICTIMS TRUSTEDID AWAITS THE CLAIM DETERMINATION. 38% OF CLAIMANTS HERESY DETERMINATION WHILE 62% HAVE NOT INCLUDING MY FAMILY IN BOTH SPEAKERS HERE TODAY IT IS TAX PREPARATION TIME AND WE IMPLORE THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER FIRE SURVIVORS TAX RELIEF ON THE SETTLEMENTS AND THE ATTORNEYS AN IRS WILL RECEIVE MORE THAN THE SURVIVORS. AND FOR EXAMPLE A PRELIMINARY PAYMENT EXAMPLE IS THAT EMOTIONAL DISTRESS STATE. FEES ONE THIRD GOES TO THE ATTORNEY AT FOURTEEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SIXTY NINETEEN PERCENT- I WENT TO A CLAIM FOR CONTRACTORS FOR EXPENSES. 28% OF THE FIFTH ELEMENT WENT TO THE IRAN AND 9% WENT TO THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AND- TOTAL TAXES AND FEES WERE 370-009-0090 FIVE DOLLARS OR 89% OF THAT PRELIMINARY PAYMENT OF FORTY TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY FIVE. THROUGH THE NET IS FOUR THOUSAND AND TWENTY YOUR TAXES FEES. WHICH IS 10% OF THE. FORTY TWO THOUSAND FIVE POINT FIVE. IMINT THOUGH THIS IS ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY CAO MEDIA C. AND MICHAEL SALE TAX MY FAMILY BEEN A HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND. REPLACING OUR DAILY LIVE ITEMS SINCE TWO EIGHTEEN. WE ACTUALLY MOVE DURING HOPE IT HAD TO MAIL ORDER EVERYTHING AND HAS PAID APPROXIMATELY EIGHT POINT 25% SALES TAX OR FOURTEEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS. NOT BEEN SALES TAX GOES TO THE GENERAL FUND BUT PERHAPS ALL FIRE SURVIVORS ARE DOING OUR PART TO KEEP CITIES COUNTIES MAKANI ROLLING ALONG BY REPLACING MARC THINGS. I ALSO WORRY THAT WE MIGHT BE IN A NEW TAX BRACKET IF WE HAPPEN TO RECEIVE A DETERMINATION. ACTUALLY PUT ALLOW REPLACING BIG TICKET ITEMS WITH TAX RELIEF OF THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN DOLLARS OR NINE PERCENT. THAT WOULD GIVE ME A TOTAL OF EIGHT THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN DOLLARS WHICH WOULD ALMOST ALLOW ME TO BUY A FOR POWER SAFETY SHUT OFF THEIR POWER OUTAGE LIVING. AND WHAT WOULD I DO WITH MY DETERMINATION IF I EVER HEAR BACK THE QUOTE FROM MY DRIVEWAY ENCROACHMENT THIRTY TWO THOUSAND ARE RETAINING WALLS TWENTY TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS AND QUOTE. AT THE FUNDS TRICKLING THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WHO KNOWS WHAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY DO THAT SETTLEMENT AFTER TAXES AND FEES WILL NEVER BE ENOUGH TO REBUILD. SO PLEASE SUPPORT TAX RELIEF FOR SURVIVORS MAYBE THAT WILL HELP TO ALLOW SOME OF US TO BUY A REFRIGERATOR. THANK YOU MA'AM. THANK MISS KAY I HOPE IT OF YOU MORE THAN TWO BY. FREDERATOR MARC FOR.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB THREE SIX FIVE WHICH WILL INCENTIVIZE THE ADOPTION OF CLEANER HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS BY PROVIDING A PARTIAL SALES TAX EXEMPTION FOR ZERO AND NEAR ZERO. DRAYAGE TRUCKS. I WOULD LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT I AM ACCEPTING THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENT PROPOSED IN THE COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS. STRAIGHT TRUCKS PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN CALIFORNIA'S FREIGHT INFRASTRUCTURE BY TRANSPORTING CONTAINERS AND OTHER MATERIALS FROM PORTS TO RAIL YARDS WAREHOUSES AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS. HISTORICALLY THESE TRUCKS AND HARD BY DIESEL FUEL. A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR TO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND AIR POLLUTION AND THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES. TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF THESE VEHICLES AND OTHER SOURCES OF GHG OUR STATE IS COMMITTED TO AMBITIOUS EMISSION GOALS EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS OF WHAT YOU ARE ALL AWARE. HOWEVER DESPITE ADVANCEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY THE TRANSITION TO CLEAN DRESS TRUCKS WILL BE AN ALL OUT BATTLE. BECAUSE OF THE PRICE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIESEL TRUCKS AND THE NEWER CLEANER TECHNOLOGIES. UNLESS THE STATE PROVIDES FUNDING TO OFFSET THE COSTS IT% WILL BE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR DRAYAGE TRUCK OPERATORS TO AFFORD THE CLEANER ALTERNATIVES. AB THREE SIXTY FIVE WILL EASE THE TRANSITION TO CLEANER DREAD TRUCKS BYE EXEMPTING THE PURCHASE OF NEW AND USED ZERO AND NEAR ZERO EMISSION TRUCK DRAYAGE TRUCKS FROM. SALES TAX UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT CLEANER TECHNOLOGY WILL BE AFFORDABLE FOR CALIFORNIANS STRAIGHT TRUCK OPERATORS. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADD THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES ON AMENDMENTS TO PROTECT TAX REVENUES FOR COUNTIES. DUE TO THE TIMING ISSUES WE WILL TAKE THOSE AMENDMENTS AND THE NEXT COMMITTEE- WITH THAT BACKING MANAGER.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AB TWO SEVENTEEN WILL HELP CALIFORNIA FAMILIES WHO'VE BEEN STRUGGLING DUE TO INFLATION AND THE IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC PURCHASE SCHOOL SUPPLIES FOR THEIR CHILDREN BY CREATING A BACK TO SCHOOL SALES TAX HOLIDAY. CALIFORNIA HAS THE NATION AND IT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS A. TWENTY TWENTY REPORT FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AEA PLANNING AND URBAN RESEARCH RESEARCH ASSOCIATION FOUND THAT CALIFORNIA'S HIGH SALES TAX RATE REINFORCES STRUCTURAL INEQUALITY. THIS IS BECAUSE LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS HAVE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF THEIR INCOME TAX THAN THE AVERAGE CONSUMER LET ME REPEAT THAT THIS IS BECAUSE LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS HAVE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF THEIR INCOME TAX. THAN THE AVERAGE CONSUMER THE INEQUITBLE IMPACT OF CALIFORNIA STATE SALES TAX HINDERS THE ABILITY OF LOW INCOME FAMILIES TO PURCHASE SCHOOL SUPPLIES AND ADEQUATELY PREPARE THEIR CHILDREN FOR SCHOOL. THIS YEAR PARENTS WITH CHILDREN IN K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS ARE PROJECTED TO SPEND NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS ON A SET OF SUPPLIES. GIVEN THAT THE MANY LOW INCOME FAMILIES ARE ALREADY TAKING ON DEBT AND DELAYING NECESSARY PURCHASES AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC. MANY PARENTS ARE CHOOSING BETWEEN ADEQUATELY PREPARING THEIR CHILDREN FOR SCHOOL. OR PAYING RENT BUYING MEDICINE- EVEN PURCHASING GROCERIES PARENTS SHOULDN'T HAVE TO MAKE THAT DECISION. AB TWO SEVENTEEN HELPS MAKES SCHOOL SUPPLIES MORE AFFORDABLE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS BY CREATING A BACK TO SCHOOL SALES TAX HOLIDAY IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE PROVIDE TAX RELIEF FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE FAMILIES WHO HAVE STRUGGLED TO MAKE ENDS MEET DURING THIS PANDEMIC ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT WE WILL LIKELY SEE A MULTIBILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS THIS YEAR. I DO HAVE A WITNESS ON THE LINE- CONSTITUENT FROM THE THIRTIETH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT ALONG THE HARO- WITH THE MODERATOR PLEASE CONNECT US NOW. HEARING NOW I CAN YES. I THANK YOU VERY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER VALLADARES FOR INTRODUCING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE- EVERY YEAR FAMILIES LIKE MINE WILL SPEND HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS ON SCHOOL SUPPLIES FOR THEIR CHILDREN- AND- WHAT THE PANDEMIC IF YOU MADE IT. EVEN HARDER PREPARING KIDS FOR SCHOOL MORE DIFFICULT INFLATION HAS READ THE CARD EVERY ITEM IMAGINABLE AND PARENTS OF NEEDED TO PURCHASE MORE SUPPLIES DR CHILDREN NAVIGATE ONLINE LEARNING AND NEW SCHOOL FIFTY PARTICLES PARTICLES. AB TWO SEVENTEEN IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE THAT CREATE THE BACK TO SCHOOL SALES TAX HOLIDAY THIS WILL HELP THE MONEY BACK INTO THE POCKETS OF ALL PARENTS AND CAREGIVERS ESPECIALLY THE MOBILE FAMILIES. STRUGGLE FINANCIALLY TO ESPECIALLY DURING THE PANDEMIC. BY PASSING AB TWO SEVENTEEN THE COMMITTEE CAN PUT THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN FIRST AND HELP FAMILIES AFFORD. THOSE NECESSARY BOTH BY TO THE- THANK YOU. ARE THEREANY AT ANY WITNESSES IN THE ROOM WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT.

RESPECTFULLY OPPOSES EIGHTY TWO SEVENTEEN WELL WE UNDERSTAND THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO HELP PARENTS AND EDUCATORS. WITH BACK TO SCHOOL COSTS FIFTY P. DOES NOT SUPPORT THIS APPROACH AS IT WOULD REDUCE OVERALL FUNDING FOR EDUCATION. THE STATE CURRENTLY PROVIDES APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN TAX EXPENDITURES ANNUALLY WHICH MEANS- THIRTY BILLION IS REDIRECTED AWAY FROM SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES EACH YEAR DUE TO TAX CREDITS. WE BELIEVE THAT PROPOSITION NINETY SHOULD BE PROTECTED FROM TO FURTHER REDUCTIONS BY CREATING NEW OR EXPANDING EXISTING- TAX STRUCTURES FOR THESE REASONS WE MUST OPPOSE AB SEVENTEEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU STENY BUT IN THE ROOM RUSSIAN TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. THE NINE WITH THE MODERATE PLEASE OPEN THE MAIN LINE FOR ANY OPPOSITION TESTIMONY.

QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SOMEONE. YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS BILL ITS SIDE AS A PARENT OF SCHOOL AGE KIDS AYE I'M ENTERTAINED BY IT AND I THINK A LOT OF CALIFORNIANS ARE I THINK WE DID OPPORTUNITY SPEAK DURING SESSION ON THE FLOOR TODAY ABOUT SOME OF MY CONCERNS- WITH REGARD TO IT BEING ESSENTIALLY LIKE AN ACTUAL HOLIDAY INVOLVING A COUPLET OR NUMBER OF DAYS OF THE YEAR LEADING TO THE SCHOOL YEAR AND- CERTAINLY THE NEED FOR SCHOOL SUPPLIES IS A YEAR ROUND ONE WE CAN ANTICIPATE WHAT'S AS WE WANT TO BUY FOR OUR STUDENTS. BUT ON WE REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO THE YEARS WHY I'D HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT- I DO SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED DURING THE PANDEMIC ACCORDING OF CERTAIN SCHOOL MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES- AS WELL AS ON. YOU KNOW WITH THIS HOPEFULLY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SMALL ARE NOT SMALL BUT- YOU KNOW SMALL BUSINESSES BRICK AND MORTAR BUSINESSES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES TO SUPPORT THEM THAT TIME THIS WOULD ENCOURAGE- A LOT OF THAT GREAT IN PERSON PURCHASING TO OCCUR- IN A CONDENSED PERIOD OF TIME ALLOWING FOR OR CAUSING PERHAPS NOT THE SAME DISTANCING THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT WE SHOULD MAYBE THINK ABOUT INTO THE FUTURE SO. WITH THOSE CONCERNS AND ALSO KNOWING THAT A COMPUTER COULD BREAK A PRINTER COULD BREAK THE NEED FOR MORE INK- CAN OCCUR THROUGHOUT THE YEAR THAT WE THINK ABOUT IT ON IN A DIFFERENT IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAT'S NOT STOCK A SHORTENED PERIOD OF TIME- I'M NOT. I DON'T WANNA WRITE YOUR BILL FOR YOU- SO FOR DOING IT IS FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY OR A CERTAIN OR NO WE'RE JUST NOT GONNA CHECK TAX WHAT WE THINK ARE SCHOOL SUPPLIES- BUT THERE MIGHT BE A DIFFERENT WAY TO DO IT THAT I THINK WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE FOR. THAT B. SOME OF THOSE CAN THAT I ALSO- BUT ALL ALL SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY TO ALLOW YOU TO CONTINUE WORKING ON IT AND I GO THAT I THINK THAT GOES TO ALSO SAY THAT WE HAVE TO REALLY LOOK AT THAT THE FACT THAT THE SALES TAX IS TOO HIGH FOR MANY FAMILIES AND THAT SALES TAX IN CALIFORNIA IS REGRESSIVE AND DISPROPORTIONATE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS- LOW INCOME FAMILIES SO I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE WITH YOU AND I' THE MOM OF A FOUR YEAR OLD AND HAVE TWENTY ONE NIECES AND NEPHEWS SO I HAVE LOTS OF BROTHERS AND SISTERS TELLING ME HOW MUCH THEY SPEND ON K. THROUGH TWELVE SUPPLIES- AND OPEN TO WORKING WITH YOU AND MAKING THIS ABOUT A BILL- AS WELL. THANK YOU IN THE CARD YOU ALL STAND WITH TEACHERS ON THIS ONE IF WE WANT TO HELP LOW INCOME PEOPLE WE CAN HELP LOWER INCOME PEOPLE WE CAN INSTEAD OF THAT MONEY GOING TO EVERYONE WHETHER THEY NEED IT OR NOT BE BETTER TO INCLUDE INCREASE FOR EXAMPLE THE LOW INCOME TAX CREDIT OR OTHER- PROGRAMS TO HELP LOW INCOME PEOPLE FOR THAT REASON I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS. SEVEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. IF PROMOTED ME THANK YOU THE SERVICE MEMBERS- I THOUGHT I HEARD SENATOR OH NO SORRY. M. WELL ADJUSTING OR TO MAKE A COMMENT YOU KNOW WE ARE LOOKING AT A THIRTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS SURPLUS IN THE STATE AND WHILE I COMPLETELY AND WHOLEHEARTEDLY- BELIEVE IN FULLY FUNDING OUR EDUCATION I ALSO THINK THAT THIS SURPLUS IT'S A ONE YEAR- THE BILL THAT WOULD JUST TAKE PLACE IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE HAVE A THIRTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS. AND WE CAN AFFORDABLE FULLY FUND AND SUPPORT FULLY FUNDINGOUR K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION AND SUPPORT PARENTS AND STUDENTS AND THAT'S THE OBJECTIVE OF THE SPELL SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THEIR MOTION. ALL MAKE MOTION PER A SECOND. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND- THE MOTIONS DO PASSED TO PROCREATION MISS HOLLY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL- WHEN I AND I. GREAT GRAYSON. GRAYSON I LEVINE LEVINE I MAYES MULLIN. MON I PETRIE-NORRIS THE TRAYNOR'S ARTWORK NO WORK NO RIVAS SARAH HI THERE- I. IT SIXTIES. FOR I IT STARTED YET. MADAM CHAIR IT IS SIX TO ONE OF THOSE OUT BILLS ALL SIXTY ONE. NEXT ITEM WILL BE. THANK ITEM NUMBER TWELVE ISN'T IT BY SEVEN MEMBER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO BE JOINING YOU TODAY TO PRESENT AB SEVEN OH FOUR ON BEHALF OF OUR COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAYES. AT AND AT I WOULD ALSO JUST LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT THE AUTHOR WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. HI THIS LEGISLATION AB SEVEN ZERO FOUR IS REALLY QUITE SIMPLE BUT IT COULD HAVE A PROFOUND IMPACT. ON THOSE WHO BENEFIT FROM IT. CURRENTLY THE LOAN INTEREST DEDUCTION FOR STUDENT LOANS IS CAPPED AT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ANNUALLY. AB SEVEN ZERO FOUR WOULD REMOVE THIS CAP AND WOULD ALLOW ALL STUDENT LOAN INTEREST TO BE DEDUCTIBLE ANNUALLY. LAW CALIFORNIA CANNOT FORGIVE STUDENT LOAN THAT WE CAN MAKE IT EASIER ON BORROWERS AND REWARD THEM FOR A HIGHER DEGREE WHEN TAX SEASON COMES AROUND. UP WITH THAT I THAT WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE ONE WITNESS IN SUPPORT WERE JOINED BY CHRISTOPHER ALONG WITH THE CONFERENCE AS CALIFORNIA BAR ASSOCIATIONS. BUT AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- MY NAME IS CHRIS FURLONG I'M AN ATTORNEY AND FORMER DELEGATE FROM THE CONFERENCE OF CALIFORNIA BAR ASSOCIATIONS. THIS BILL PROVIDES A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF TALENTED TEACHERS HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS ENGINEERS AND THE MORE THAN FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE SADDLED WITH STUDENT LOAN DEBT. WHO CONINUE TO LEAVE CALIFORNIA FOR STATES WITH LOWER STATE INCOME TAXES. UNDER CURRENT LAW TAXPAYERS EARNING LESS THAN FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS MAY ONLY DEDUCT UP TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN STUDENT LOAN INTEREST. GRADUALLY PHASED OUT SO THAT TAXPAYERS EARNING MORE THAN SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. ARE UNABLE TO DEDUCT ANY OF THEIR STUDENT LOAN INTEREST. NEARING EXISTING FEDERAL LAWS THE STATE CURRENTLY DOES MAKES NO SENSE FOR CALIFORNIANS. MANY OF WHOM ARE MAKING MONTHLY STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS THAT ARE EQUAL TO OR MORE THAN THEIR RENT OR MORTGAGE PAYMENTS. TOTAL STUDENT LOAN DEBT HAS GROWN A HUNDRED AND 57% IN JUST THE LAST TWELVE YEARS. FROM FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS TO MORE THAN ONE POINT FIVE TRILLION TODAY. CALIFORNIANS HAVE AN ESTIMATED ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT BILLION IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT. AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY. ACCORDING TO FORBES UNFORTUNATELY MORE THAN DEFAULT ON THEIR LOANS BY NEXT YEAR. AND THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS ONLY MADE THINGS WORSE. STUDENT LOAN DEBT ALSO DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS STUDENTS OF COLOR. AND PRESENTS YET ANOTHER BARRIER TO SUCH STUDENTS PRIVATE PRESENTE SHIN AND PROFESSIONS WITH HIGHER EDUCATION COSTS. STUDENT LOAN DEBT FURTHER DISCOURAGES DOCTORS LAWYERS SUCH AS MYSELF AND OTHER PROFESSIONALS FROM ENGAGING AND SOCIALLY BENEFICIAL PUBLIC INTEREST WORK AND AS EXPLAINED IN THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION SUPPORTING LETTER. FROM TAKING ON A LARGER MEDICARE OR MEDICAID ALL PATIENT LOAD. THIS BILL PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIANS TO SAVE FOR RETIREMENT SET ASIDE A DOWN PAYMENT ON A HOME OR EVEN JUST MEET THEIR MONTHLY PAYMENT EXPENSES. I RESPECTFULLY OR DRIVE OUT THANK YOU THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN THE ROOM WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. C.
