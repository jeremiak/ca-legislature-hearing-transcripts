FIVE EIGHTY SIX AGRICULTURAL

00:19:06.411 --> 00:19:06.945
LAND FOR SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGE

00:19:07.012 --> 00:19:07.546
FARMERS AND RANCHERS THE REAL

00:19:07.613 --> 00:19:07.913
ACT [inaudible]

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:13.018
OF EIGHT TWENTY NINETEEN

00:19:13.085 --> 00:19:15.153
OPPORTUNITY A NEW OPPORTUNITIES

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.321
FOR SOCIALLY.

00:19:16.388 --> 00:19:17.489
THE DISADVANTAGE FARMERS AND

00:19:17.556 --> 00:19:18.757
RANCHERS TO GAIN ACCESS TO

00:19:18.824 --> 00:19:20.526
AGRICULTURAL LAND.

00:19:20.592 --> 00:19:21.627
AND SO UT A LOSSES OF

00:19:21.693 --> 00:19:23.061
AGRICULTURE FOREMAN RANGE LAND

00:19:23.128 --> 00:19:24.363
ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT

00:19:24.429 --> 00:19:25.731
CONSERVATION.

00:19:25.797 --> 00:19:27.799
ANYA LOSSES AVERAGE AROUND FIFTY

00:19:27.866 --> 00:19:29.268
THOUSAND ACRES PER YEAR.

00:19:29.334 --> 00:19:30.435
AND SO SUCH LOSSES BECAUSE THIS

00:19:30.502 --> 00:19:32.070
IS A A SERIOUS THREAT TO

00:19:32.137 --> 00:19:33.205
AGRICULTURE.

00:19:33.272 --> 00:19:34.273
CERTAINLY TO OUR LOCAL

00:19:34.339 --> 00:19:36.508
AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIES -- AND TO

00:19:36.575 --> 00:19:37.843
STATEWIDE FOOD PRODUCTION.

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:39.011
AND SO ACCORDING TO THE DATA

00:19:39.077 --> 00:19:40.512
FROM THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN

00:19:40.579 --> 00:19:41.580
CENSUS OF AGRICULTURE.

00:19:41.647 --> 00:19:43.382
WE KNOW THAT THE AVERAGE AGE OF

00:19:43.448 --> 00:19:44.850
OUR FARMERS IS RISING.

00:19:44.917 --> 00:19:46.485
WITH THE CURRENT AVERAGE AGE OF

00:19:46.552 --> 00:19:48.921
OF NEARLY SIXTY YEARS OLD.

00:19:48.987 --> 00:19:50.923
WE ALSO SEE THE GAP BETWEEN MALE

00:19:50.989 --> 00:19:52.958
AND FEMALE FARMERS CLOSING.

00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:53.859
AS A NUMBER OF FEMALE FARMERS

00:19:53.926 --> 00:19:55.460
HAS GROWN DRAMATICALLY SINCE THE

00:19:55.527 --> 00:19:57.362
NINETEEN EIGHTIES.

00:19:57.429 --> 00:19:58.697
WE KNOW THAT AG PRODUCTION

00:19:58.764 --> 00:19:59.898
EXPENSES HAVE INCREASED

00:19:59.965 --> 00:20:01.633
SIGNIFICANTLY.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.035
I AND GOVERNMENT SUPPORT IN THE

00:20:03.101 --> 00:20:04.236
WAY FUNDING HAS ALSO INCREASED

00:20:04.303 --> 00:20:06.305
OVER TIME.

00:20:06.371 --> 00:20:07.940
WE ALSO SEE THE TRENDING SHIFT

00:20:08.006 --> 00:20:09.141
TO LARGER AGRICULTURAL

00:20:09.207 --> 00:20:11.209
OPERATIONS WITH CROP ACREAGE

00:20:11.276 --> 00:20:12.678
BEING CONCENTRATED IN FEWER.

00:20:12.744 --> 00:20:15.514
BUT LARGER FIRMS [inaudible]

00:20:15.581 --> 00:20:17.482
UNFORTUNATELY -- WE SEE THE

00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:18.550
NUMBER OF PEOPLE ENTERING

00:20:18.617 --> 00:20:20.752
AGRICULTURE DECLINING YEAR AFTER

00:20:20.819 --> 00:20:22.754
YEAR AND THIS POTENTIAL SHORTAGE

00:20:22.821 --> 00:20:24.089
OF CALIFORNIA FARMERS.

00:20:24.156 --> 00:20:25.157
SHOULD BE ONE OF THE PRIMARY

00:20:25.223 --> 00:20:26.391
PROBLEMS WE SEEK TO RESOLVE AS A

00:20:26.458 --> 00:20:27.759
STATE.

00:20:27.826 --> 00:20:29.661
I AS A FORM IS TOUGH.

00:20:29.728 --> 00:20:31.330
NOW AND AND ENCOURAGING THE NEXT

00:20:31.396 --> 00:20:33.165
GENERATION TO FARM TO BECOME

00:20:33.231 --> 00:20:35.000
FARMERS IS AN INCREDIBLE

00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:36.335
CHALLENGE.

00:20:36.401 --> 00:20:37.836
AND SO INCREASINGLY HIGH LAND

00:20:37.903 --> 00:20:39.771
PRICES LACK OF ACCESS TO

00:20:39.838 --> 00:20:41.073
RESOURCES.

00:20:41.139 --> 00:20:42.674
THESE ARE BARRIERS FOR ALL

00:20:42.741 --> 00:20:45.844
FARMERS -- AND FOR SOCIALLY --

00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:47.145
THE DISADVANTAGE FARMERS THESE

00:20:47.212 --> 00:20:48.914
BARRIERS CAN BE EVEN MORE

00:20:48.981 --> 00:20:49.481
PRONOUNCED AND DIFFICULT TO

00:20:49.548 --> 00:20:50.849
OVERCOME.

00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:51.950
AND SO I COMMEND ASSEMBLYWOMAN

00:20:52.017 --> 00:20:53.418
ARGUE ARE CURRY FOR HER

00:20:53.485 --> 00:20:54.319
LEADERSHIP ON AGRICULTURAL

00:20:54.386 --> 00:20:55.854
ISSUES AND FOR HER WORK IN

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:57.823
CHAMPIONING THE FARMER QUITY

00:20:57.889 --> 00:21:01.326
ACT OF OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:21:01.393 --> 00:21:03.996
SIGNED INTO LAW BY -- GOVERNOR

00:21:04.062 --> 00:21:05.597
BROWN THE FORMER EQUITY ACT NOW

00:21:05.664 --> 00:21:06.565
REQUIRES.

00:21:06.632 --> 00:21:07.633
THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

00:21:07.699 --> 00:21:09.368
FOOD AND AGRICULTURE TO FOCUS ON

00:21:09.434 --> 00:21:11.770
AND ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES

00:21:11.837 --> 00:21:13.238
FACING FARMERS OF COLOR IN OUR

00:21:13.305 --> 00:21:14.640
STATE.

00:21:14.706 --> 00:21:16.808
BY MAKING ACCESS TO STATE AND

00:21:16.875 --> 00:21:19.344
FEDERAL RESOURCES MORE EQUITABLE.

00:21:19.411 --> 00:21:21.179
AND SO AS A RESULT OUR STATE --

00:21:21.246 --> 00:21:22.714
MUST STRIVE TO INSTITUTIONALIZE

00:21:22.781 --> 00:21:24.049
EQUITY.

00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:26.051
WITHIN OUR AGRICULTURAL POLICIES

00:21:26.118 --> 00:21:27.653
AND PROGRAMS.

00:21:27.719 --> 00:21:28.720
I AM FOLLOWING THESE LINES THIS

00:21:28.787 --> 00:21:30.222
BILL WOULD ESTABLISH THE REAL

00:21:30.288 --> 00:21:32.124
LOAN FUND PROGRAM A PROGRAM THAT

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:33.425
WOULD PROVIDE LOANS AND GRANTS

00:21:33.492 --> 00:21:34.926
TO ARE SOCIALLY -- AT THE

00:21:34.993 --> 00:21:35.927
DISADVANTAGED FARMERS AND

00:21:35.994 --> 00:21:38.397
RANCHERS AND CREATE OPPORTUNITY.

00:21:38.463 --> 00:21:40.465
TO ACCESS FARMLAND AND RANGE

00:21:40.532 --> 00:21:42.300
LAND OWNERSHIP OF OR LONG TERM

00:21:42.367 --> 00:21:43.735
LEASES.

00:21:43.802 --> 00:21:44.803
AND SO THIS BILLS EVERYTHING THE

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:46.405
FARMER EQUITY ACT INTENDED TO

00:21:46.471 --> 00:21:47.839
ACCOMPLISH.

00:21:47.906 --> 00:21:49.941
AND THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT --

00:21:50.008 --> 00:21:52.044
AB NINE EIGHT SIX WOULD LEAD TO

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:53.545
AN EQUITABLE INVESTMENT OF STATE

00:21:53.612 --> 00:21:56.915
RESOURCES. TO SUPPORT THE FUTURE.

00:21:56.982 --> 00:21:58.417
OF SOCIALLY.

00:21:58.483 --> 00:22:00.085
DISADVANTAGED FARMERS THROUGHOUT

00:22:00.152 --> 00:22:02.320

ACCOMPLISH BOTH OF THOSE GOALS

00:25:14.312 --> 00:25:15.113
AT ONCE.

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.148
SO QUICKLY -- A STORY ABOUT ONE

00:25:17.215 --> 00:25:18.216
OF THE CLIENTS THAT WE WORK WITH

00:25:18.283 --> 00:25:19.918
A KITCHEN TABLE ADVISORS -- HAVE

00:25:19.985 --> 00:25:21.386
YEAR WAS ABLE TO GROW HIS

00:25:21.453 --> 00:25:23.688
BUSINESS FROM LEASING ONE POINT

00:25:23.755 --> 00:25:26.191
FIVE ACRES TO PURCHASING A TWO

00:25:26.258 --> 00:25:29.761
HUNDRED ACRE RANCH A COUPLE

00:25:29.828 --> 00:25:30.495
YEARS AGO.

00:25:30.562 --> 00:25:31.329
FROM THE ONE POINT FIVE ACRES ON

00:25:31.396 --> 00:25:32.631
LEASE TO THE TWO HUNDRED ACRES

00:25:32.697 --> 00:25:33.265
HE NOW OWNS HAVE YOU EVER THE

00:25:33.331 --> 00:25:35.300
BEEN BENEFICIARY OF MULTIPLE

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:38.203
WELL RESOURCE AND WELL ORGANIZED --

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:40.238
ENTITIES WORKING IN COORDINATION

00:25:40.305 --> 00:25:41.940
WITH ONE ANOTHER TO PROTECT

00:25:42.007 --> 00:25:43.608
FARMLAND AND TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:25:43.675 --> 00:25:45.510
IT WAS ACCESSIBLE.

00:25:45.577 --> 00:25:46.945
NOW THE REASON WHY I HAVE YEARS

00:25:47.012 --> 00:25:48.313
SUCCESSFUL IS BECAUSE HE'S A

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:49.614

00:25:49.681 --> 00:25:51.883
BUSINESSMAN HE JUST NEEDED THE

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:53.318
ACCESS TO LAND.

00:25:53.385 --> 00:25:54.920
SO IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE A

00:25:54.986 --> 00:25:56.855
STRATEGY WAS USED -- THAT'S

00:25:56.922 --> 00:25:59.057
OFTEN REFERRED TO AS BY PROTECT

00:25:59.124 --> 00:26:00.392
CELL WHERE ONE OR MORE

00:26:00.458 --> 00:26:02.127
CONSERVATION ENTITIES POOL

00:26:02.193 --> 00:26:03.728
RESOURCES TO BUY THE LAND FEE

00:26:03.795 --> 00:26:05.363
TITLE PROTECTED WITH A

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:07.299
CONSERVATION EASEMENT AND THEN

00:26:07.365 --> 00:26:08.800
SELL IT BACK TO A NEW FARMER.

00:26:08.867 --> 00:26:10.302
NOW IN OUR COUNTY AND IN MUCH OF

00:26:10.368 --> 00:26:12.304
CALIFORNIA WHEN YOU'RE REDUCING

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:14.306
THE VALUE OF LAND BY PUTTING A

00:26:14.372 --> 00:26:15.907
CONSERVATION EASEMENT IT'S AT A

00:26:15.974 --> 00:26:19.210
RATE OF FIFTY TWO IN OUR COUNTY

00:26:19.277 --> 00:26:20.445
75% OF THE VALUE.

00:26:20.512 --> 00:26:21.913
SO THIS IS AN OFTEN OVERLOOKED

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.515
SIDE I THINK OF AGRICULTURAL

00:26:23.581 --> 00:26:24.849

THAT LAND AND THEREFORE IT'S

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:33.024
ACCESSIBILITY.

00:26:33.091 --> 00:26:34.926

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.550
AND SO -- FOR MEAN IT MANY OF US

00:28:38.616 --> 00:28:43.221
WHO MIGRATED -- TWO SANTANA IT'S

00:28:43.288 --> 00:28:45.490
IT'S A PLACE THAT WE CALL HOME

00:28:45.557 --> 00:28:46.658
IT'S LIKE OUR HOME AWAY FROM

00:28:46.724 --> 00:28:48.960
HOME AND SO IT'S THE THE THE

00:28:49.027 --> 00:28:50.061
FOOD.

00:28:50.128 --> 00:28:52.530
THE MUSIC EVERYTHING HAS BEEN.

00:28:52.597 --> 00:28:54.332
THE MANNERISMS OF THE PEOPLE

00:28:54.399 --> 00:28:56.601
IT'S A IT'S A GOOD.

00:28:56.668 --> 00:28:57.869
OUR COMMUNITY TO BE IN IN A

00:28:57.936 --> 00:29:01.406
COMMUNITY THAT WE LOVE --

00:29:01.473 --> 00:29:02.373
SOMETHING IS ALSO A PLEASE

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.109
THAT'S VERY HARD TO LIVE --

00:29:04.175 --> 00:29:06.811
BASICALLY IT'S NOT IT'S NOT RARE

00:29:06.878 --> 00:29:08.847
FOR OUR FAMILIES TO LIVE -- MANY

00:29:08.913 --> 00:29:10.949
FAMILIES IN ONE APARTMENT OR IN

00:29:11.015 --> 00:29:13.384
A HOUSE -- THIS IS BECAUSE THE

00:29:13.451 --> 00:29:15.286
THE PRICE OF THE PROPERTY IS

00:29:15.353 --> 00:29:16.421
REALLY HIGH [inaudible]

00:29:16.488 --> 00:29:22.227
AND SO -- MANY OF THE THE ARE

00:29:22.293 --> 00:29:24.996
ARE CONTEXT OF LIVING A FORCES

00:29:25.063 --> 00:29:27.465
US TO COME TOGETHER NOW AND SO

00:29:27.532 --> 00:29:28.633
MANY PEOPLE HAVE COME TOGETHER

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.301
AROUND HOUSING ISSUES.

00:29:30.368 --> 00:29:32.070
IMMIGRATION ISSUES AND IN OUR

00:29:32.137 --> 00:29:34.239
CASE -- BECAUSE WE BELIEVE WE

00:29:34.305 --> 00:29:37.041
HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE ACCESS TO

00:29:37.108 --> 00:29:39.110
HEALTHY FOOD WE CREATED THOUGHT

00:29:39.177 --> 00:29:43.715
COOPERATIVE TO A GIRL FOOD --

00:29:43.781 --> 00:29:44.249
FOR OUR OUR NEIGHBORS AND

00:29:44.315 --> 00:29:45.016
OURSELVES.

00:29:45.083 --> 00:29:48.086
SOLO BUT THIS -- BUT THIS WAY A

00:29:48.153 --> 00:29:50.221
OF THE THE OBSTACLES THAT I I OF

00:29:50.288 --> 00:29:52.023
THE IT HAS BEEN MENTIONED IT

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:53.024
APPLIES TO US.

00:29:53.091 --> 00:29:55.026
AND IN MANY CASES IT'S EVEN

00:29:55.093 --> 00:29:56.628
WORSE BECAUSE MANY OF US DON'T

00:29:56.694 --> 00:29:59.664
HAVE -- PROPERTY OR ANY ASSETS

00:29:59.731 --> 00:30:03.001
THAT -- THAT WE CAN COME UP

00:30:03.067 --> 00:30:04.702
FOURTH AND SAW.

00:30:04.769 --> 00:30:06.437
IN THE LAST FEW YEARS -- A LAND

00:30:06.504 --> 00:30:08.006
SHOWS THAT WAS CREATED WAS A MAN

00:30:08.072 --> 00:30:11.943
TOOL. TO CREATE A STRATEGY FOR

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:14.312
OUR FARMERS AND COMMUNITY PEOPLE

00:30:14.379 --> 00:30:15.747
TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE.

00:30:15.813 --> 00:30:17.749
TO HAVE ACCESS TOOL -- LAND TO

00:30:17.815 --> 00:30:19.217
OWN IT.

00:30:19.284 --> 00:30:22.086
AND SO -- THIS HAS AT THIS IT

00:30:22.153 --> 00:30:23.821
WAS CREATED IN TWO THOUSAND

00:30:23.888 --> 00:30:25.857
SEVENTEEN AND SINCE THEN --

00:30:25.924 --> 00:30:28.960
ALTHOUGH WE'VE BEEN ABLE -- TO

00:30:29.027 --> 00:30:31.329
COMING TOOL ON NEGOTIATIONS WITH

00:30:31.396 --> 00:30:33.198
THE CITY FOR ONE BACON Là --

00:30:33.264 --> 00:30:34.532
SOME OF THE OBSTACLE HAS BEEN

00:30:34.599 --> 00:30:37.101
THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY **** TOOL

00:30:37.168 --> 00:30:39.137
SHOW FOR AND SO WE CAN GET A

00:30:39.204 --> 00:30:40.338
LOAN.

00:30:40.405 --> 00:30:41.739
AND SO THAT HAS KINDA LIKE

00:30:41.806 --> 00:30:44.475
EXTENDED OUR NEGOTIATIONS TOOL

00:30:44.542 --> 00:30:45.677
TO THIS POINT.

00:30:45.743 --> 00:30:46.744
IT'S NOT FOR SURE WHETHER WE'RE

00:30:46.811 --> 00:30:48.112
GONNA GET IT BUT THE POINT IS

00:30:48.179 --> 00:30:52.850
THAT -- WITHOUT THOSE ASSETS --

00:30:52.917 --> 00:30:54.252
IT MAKES IT THAT MUCH MORE

00:30:54.319 --> 00:30:56.654
DIFFICULT TO BE ABLE -- TO BE

00:30:56.721 --> 00:30:58.089
ABLE TO GET A CAR THAT LINE.

00:30:58.156 --> 00:30:59.791
AND SO.

00:30:59.857 --> 00:31:02.860
I THINK. ONE OF THE MAIN POINT

00:31:02.927 --> 00:31:04.562
IS THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT --

00:31:04.629 --> 00:31:07.699
TO REMARK IS THAT -- IT'S THE

00:31:07.765 --> 00:31:10.501
IT'S THE IT'S THAT FIRST -- FOOT

00:31:10.568 --> 00:31:11.936
A FOOT IN THE DOOR.

00:31:12.003 --> 00:31:13.771
SO WE NEED WE NEED THAT SUPPORT --

00:31:13.838 --> 00:31:14.606
TO GET THEIR FOOT IN THE DOOR

00:31:14.672 --> 00:31:16.274
BECAUSE ONCE WE HAVE LAND WILL

00:31:16.341 --> 00:31:17.842
BE ABLE TO USE THAT.

00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:21.379
AND KEEP GROWING THE LET A TO BE

00:31:21.446 --> 00:31:23.214
ABLE TO A SECURE LAND IN

00:31:23.281 --> 00:31:24.115
SOMETHING ELSE SO THAT WE CAN

00:31:24.182 --> 00:31:25.350
NOT PRESERVE IT.

00:31:25.416 --> 00:31:26.251

RUSSIAN WITH A CALIFORNIA FROM

00:32:49.901 --> 00:32:50.935

00:32:56.007 --> 00:32:57.575
OUR CONCERNS THAT WE DO HAVE

00:32:57.642 --> 00:32:58.343
WITH THE BILL.

00:32:58.409 --> 00:33:00.011
AND SO I THINK FIRST AND

00:33:00.078 --> 00:33:01.012
FOREMOST I I WANT TO SAY WE

00:33:02.447 --> 00:33:03.514
PREMISE OF THE BILL THAT

00:33:03.581 --> 00:33:04.682
SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS

00:33:04.749 --> 00:33:05.750
AND RANCHERS HAVE.

00:33:05.817 --> 00:33:07.952
REAL ISSUES TO ACCESSING CAPITAL

00:33:08.019 --> 00:33:09.687
TO PURCHASE OR TO LEASE LAND.

00:33:09.754 --> 00:33:10.922
AND TO LACKS SOME OF THAT

00:33:10.988 --> 00:33:11.856
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OF THE

00:33:11.923 --> 00:33:13.524
TECHNICAL KNOW HOW ON HOW TO

00:33:13.591 --> 00:33:14.792
UNDERSTAND AG FINANCING I THINK.

00:33:14.859 --> 00:33:16.928
DOES HAVE COMPLETE VALUE IN

00:33:16.994 --> 00:33:18.663
HAVING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW WE

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:20.598
MOVE THE NEEDLE ON THAT ISSUE --

00:33:20.665 --> 00:33:22.567
BUT I THINK PRACTICALLY WE DO

00:33:22.633 --> 00:33:24.168
HAVE SOME PROBLEMS WITH -- HOW

00:33:24.235 --> 00:33:25.803
THE BILL IS CRAFTED THAT WE LOVE

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:27.071
TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE

00:33:27.138 --> 00:33:28.406
AUTHOR AND SPONSORS ON I THINK?

00:33:28.473 --> 00:33:29.607
FIRST AND FOREMOST BEYOND THE

00:33:29.674 --> 00:33:30.575
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANT

00:33:30.641 --> 00:33:31.542
PROGRAM THE BILL ALSO

00:33:31.609 --> 00:33:32.744
ESTABLISHES A SEPARATE GRANT

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:35.213
PROGRAM THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE.

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:36.347
FOR AMONG OTHER CITIES AND

00:33:36.414 --> 00:33:38.883
COUNTIES TO ACQUIRE ACLAND HOLD

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:40.685
ITS PLACE UNDER AN AGRICULTURAL

00:33:40.752 --> 00:33:41.819
EASEMENT AND THEN EITHER

00:33:41.886 --> 00:33:43.054
IDENTIFY.

00:33:43.121 --> 00:33:44.155
A SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGE FARMER

00:33:44.222 --> 00:33:45.890
RANCHER TO LEASE THAT LANDS OR

00:33:45.957 --> 00:33:49.060
TWO THEN ACQUIRE THAT LAND AS

00:33:49.127 --> 00:33:49.627
WELL OR TO TRANSFER THE FEE

00:33:49.694 --> 00:33:50.027
TITLE [inaudible]

00:33:50.094 --> 00:33:51.095
I'M.

00:33:51.162 --> 00:33:51.629
I THINK IT.

00:33:51.696 --> 00:33:53.431
WE HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH THE

00:33:53.498 --> 00:33:55.233
PERSPECTIVE THAT.

00:33:55.299 --> 00:33:56.567
THE BILL WOULD AUTHORIZE THIS

00:33:56.634 --> 00:33:58.703
GRANT RECIPIENTS OF A COUNTY OR

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:01.372
A CITY IN IN ONE CIRCUMSTANCE.

00:34:01.439 --> 00:34:03.074
TO ACQUIRE WHAT ONCE WAS

00:34:03.141 --> 00:34:05.410
PRODUCTIVE ACLAND AND WITH NO

00:34:05.476 --> 00:34:06.677
MANDATE TO MANAGE THAT LAND

00:34:06.744 --> 00:34:08.913
INTERMITTENTLY WHILE THEY FIND

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:09.480
THAT SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED

00:34:09.547 --> 00:34:10.882
FARMERS RANCHER WE HAVE SOME

00:34:10.948 --> 00:34:11.916
REAL CONCERNS THAT THAT MIGHT

00:34:11.983 --> 00:34:14.018
LEAD TO ATLANTA BEING TAKEN OUT

00:34:14.085 --> 00:34:15.019
OF PRODUCTIVITY.

00:34:15.086 --> 00:34:16.554
THERE'S ALSO NO TIMELINE ON WHEN

00:34:16.621 --> 00:34:17.989
THAT TRANSFER INSTANCE TO HAPPEN

00:34:18.055 --> 00:34:19.590
SO IT COULD BE A MUCH LONGER

00:34:19.657 --> 00:34:21.459
SITUATION I THINK WE UNDERSTAND

00:34:21.526 --> 00:34:22.894
THAT.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.128
FEE TITLE ACQUISITION.

00:34:24.195 --> 00:34:25.930
ATTY EASEMENT CONTRACTS ARE

00:34:25.997 --> 00:34:27.098
COMPLICATED I THINK WE THE

00:34:27.165 --> 00:34:30.034
SPONSORS ECHOED THAT SENTIMENT --

00:34:30.101 --> 00:34:31.335
AND SO WITHOUT THOSE PARAMETERS

00:34:31.402 --> 00:34:32.870
IT MAKES IT REALLY DIFFICULT TO

00:34:32.937 --> 00:34:33.838
SEE THAT THIS WOULD ACTUALLY

00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:35.673
HAVE THE ANTITHETICAL A FACT

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:36.808
THAT IT'S INTENDED TO DO.

00:34:36.874 --> 00:34:38.009
I BEYOND THAT THE BILL ALSO

00:34:38.075 --> 00:34:39.243
DOESN'T HAVE.

00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:41.179
ANY CONSIDERATION THAT THAT THE

00:34:41.245 --> 00:34:43.614
LAND THAT'S REQUIRED BY THAT

00:34:43.681 --> 00:34:45.383
GRANT RECIPIENTS IS PRODUCTIVE

00:34:45.450 --> 00:34:48.019
ATLANTA SO IT COULD BE NON PRIME

00:34:48.085 --> 00:34:48.886
LAND WHICH IS.

00:34:48.953 --> 00:34:51.022
NOT THE GREATEST OPPORTUNITY FOR

00:34:51.088 --> 00:34:52.123
THE SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:53.925
FARMERS OR RANCHERS TO FIND --

00:34:53.991 --> 00:34:55.460
ECONOMIC PRODUCTIVITY THERE'S NO

00:34:55.526 --> 00:34:56.828
STANDARD THAT THERE BE WATER

00:34:56.894 --> 00:34:58.996
AVAILABILITY ON THAT LANDS WHICH

00:34:59.063 --> 00:35:00.865
EVERY FARMER I THINK DEALS WITH

00:35:00.932 --> 00:35:02.834
NOW IN THIS CLIMATE -- OR THAT

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:04.302
IT'S THE APPROPRIATE SIZE THAT

00:35:04.368 --> 00:35:06.137
CAN ACCOMMODATE A TRULY

00:35:06.204 --> 00:35:09.373
PRODUCTIVE -- ACT PLOT -- I I'M

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.541
WORRIED THAT WITHOUT THESE

00:35:10.608 --> 00:35:12.009
PARAMETERS PUT IN A SOCIALLY

00:35:12.076 --> 00:35:13.744
