YEARS LATER WE HAVE A 20001100%

00:22:41.026 --> 00:22:42.527
INCREASE IN FENTANYL

00:22:42.594 --> 00:22:44.463
DISTRIBUTION AND TRAFFICKING.

00:22:44.529 --> 00:22:46.498
THAT SAYS SOMETHING WAS WORKING

00:22:46.565 --> 00:22:51.603
WHEN THE OTHER TWO DRUGS HAVE.

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:53.305
ACTUALLY KIND OF FALLEN OFF THE

00:22:53.371 --> 00:22:54.673
RADAR. UP I GUESS SIMPLY

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:55.774
SPEAKING. AND THIS DRUG IS

00:22:55.841 --> 00:22:57.876
BECOME- THE ONE THAT'S BEING

00:22:57.943 --> 00:22:59.177
IMPORTED MANUFACTURED IN HUGE

00:22:59.244 --> 00:23:00.445
AMOUNTS WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT

00:23:00.512 --> 00:23:02.447
THE PEOPLE. WHO ARE REALLY

00:23:02.514 --> 00:23:04.850
ATTICS ARE I LOOK AT THIS IS A

00:23:04.916 --> 00:23:06.318
THREE LEGGED STOOL YOU GOTTA

00:23:06.384 --> 00:23:08.820
HAVE EDUCATION. YOU GOT TO HAVE

00:23:08.887 --> 00:23:10.021
TREATMENT BUT YOU GOTTA HAVE

00:23:10.088 --> 00:23:12.224
CONSEQUENCES AND I BELIEVE A

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:12.858
YOUNG MAN WHO SPOKE AT A PRESS

00:23:12.924 --> 00:23:15.093
CONFERENCE LAST WEEK. R. WHO'D

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:15.927
SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME

00:23:15.994 --> 00:23:18.130
INCARCERATED. REALLY SPOKE VERY

00:23:18.196 --> 00:23:19.865
FERVENTLY ABOUT THE ONLY REASON

00:23:19.931 --> 00:23:24.035
HE GOT OUT- INTO- EIGHT A JOB

00:23:24.102 --> 00:23:25.637
HE'S A BUSINESS OWNER BECAUSE HE

00:23:25.704 --> 00:23:27.539
HAD CONSEQUENCES. AND THOSE WERE

00:23:27.606 --> 00:23:29.107
GIVEN TO HIM WHEN HE WAS

00:23:29.174 --> 00:23:30.475
INCARCERATED BECAUSE HE GOT

00:23:30.542 --> 00:23:32.477
EDUCATION AND TREATMENT WHILE HE

00:23:32.544 --> 00:23:35.881
WAS IN. INCARCERATED SO I THINK

00:23:35.947 --> 00:23:37.949
WE HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT JUST

00:23:38.016 --> 00:23:39.718
NOT GENERALLY SAYING SINCE

00:23:39.785 --> 00:23:41.787
ANNOUNCEMENTS DON'T WORK. MAYBE

00:23:41.853 --> 00:23:43.555
WE NEED TO STUDY- THAT REALLY

00:23:43.622 --> 00:23:45.123
LOOKS AT THE KINDS OF SENSE AND

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:46.725
HANDS MOST THAT HAVE WORKED WHEN

00:23:46.792 --> 00:23:48.059
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE

00:23:48.126 --> 00:23:49.828
LARGEST THREE. DISTRIBUTORS THAT

00:23:49.895 --> 00:23:51.763
THE CARTELS BUT I'D LIKE TO ASK

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:54.166
WHY EXPERT WITNESS AND THAT

00:23:54.232 --> 00:23:55.934
WOULD BE SURE OF MARS TO TALK

00:23:56.001 --> 00:23:56.935
ABOUT THAT BECAUSE HE HAS.

00:23:57.002 --> 00:23:59.304
BASICALLY I'D I UNDERSTAND AND

00:23:59.371 --> 00:24:00.739
BECAUSE I'M ORANGE COUNTY AND

00:24:00.806 --> 00:24:02.207
WHAT SHARE OF MARS IS DONE WE

00:24:02.274 --> 00:24:03.809
BASICALLY HAVE A JAIL IT'S

00:24:03.875 --> 00:24:05.510
BECOME ALMOST A TRIAGE CENTER TO

00:24:05.577 --> 00:24:07.479
GET PEOPLE WHO ARE. THE ADDICTS

00:24:07.546 --> 00:24:09.481
THE USERS INTO TREATMENT BUT

00:24:09.548 --> 00:24:11.116
HE'S NOT ABLE TO REACH BEYOND

00:24:11.183 --> 00:24:12.751
THAT AND GET THE BIG GUYS AND

00:24:12.818 --> 00:24:13.785
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

00:24:13.852 --> 00:24:16.922
HERE SO. I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU TO

00:24:16.988 --> 00:24:18.056
DIRECT THAT QUESTION TO SHARE

00:24:18.123 --> 00:24:22.527
FARMS. HERE YEAH. SHE FARMS

00:24:22.594 --> 00:24:24.629
WHICH QUESTION. YES THEY GIVE

00:24:24.696 --> 00:24:26.164
CHAIRMAN RESERVE THE COMMITTEE

00:24:26.231 --> 00:24:27.933
AS CENTER BATES REFERNCED

00:24:27.999 --> 00:24:29.801
PERSON FOREMOST THE REFERENCE

00:24:29.868 --> 00:24:31.102
THAT THE WAR ON DRUGS HAS FAILED

00:24:31.169 --> 00:24:32.904
LET ME DRAW A DISTINCTION WARS

00:24:32.971 --> 00:24:34.506
ARE FINITE BUT NOT INTENDED TO

00:24:34.573 --> 00:24:37.075
BE- INFINITE- THIS IS NOT A WAR

00:24:37.142 --> 00:24:39.077
THIS AND FOR SOME OF OUR STATE'S

00:24:39.144 --> 00:24:40.312
LAWS IS A DISTINCT DIFFERENCE

00:24:40.378 --> 00:24:42.781
BETWEEN THE TWO YOU CAN'T PROVE

00:24:42.848 --> 00:24:44.816
A NEGATIVE I THINK IF WE WERE TO

00:24:44.883 --> 00:24:46.218
JUST GIVEN UP YEARS AGO WE WOULD

00:24:46.284 --> 00:24:48.053
HAVE NO IDEA WHAT CONDITION WE

00:24:48.119 --> 00:24:49.821
WOULD BE IN TODAY. BUT AS

00:24:49.888 --> 00:24:51.957
SENATOR BATES HAS TESTIFIED TO-

00:24:52.023 --> 00:24:53.058
I BELIEVE IT'S COMPLETELY TRUE

00:24:53.124 --> 00:24:54.726
REGARDING FENTANYL WITHIN OUR

00:24:54.793 --> 00:24:57.429
STATE IF YOU GO BACK TO DATA-

00:24:57.495 --> 00:25:00.932
PRESENTED BY CDC IN TWO THOUSAND

00:25:00.999 --> 00:25:02.500
THIRTEEN OF ALL THE DEATHS

00:25:02.567 --> 00:25:03.768
NATIONALLY 4% OF THOSE THE

00:25:03.835 --> 00:25:05.737
PREVAILING DRUG THEY CALLED THAT

00:25:05.804 --> 00:25:07.806
DOUBT WAS SPENT IN L. THAT FIVE

00:25:07.873 --> 00:25:09.674
YEARS LATER IN TWO THOUSAND

00:25:09.741 --> 00:25:10.976
EIGHTEEN IT HAD RIPPED 40% OF

00:25:11.042 --> 00:25:12.477
DEATH NATIONALLY THEY'LL BE OUR

00:25:12.544 --> 00:25:14.913
CONTENT SPECIFICALLY. OVER 70%

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.115
SO LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY IS

00:25:17.182 --> 00:25:18.683
ACTUALLY CURSED IN MY BELIEVE

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:23.955
THE TRUTH THE. TRAFFICKING OF

00:25:24.022 --> 00:25:25.690
NARCOTICS. AND STORE NOW. THAT

00:25:25.757 --> 00:25:27.359
THE THREE PRONGS OF THIS AB TRUE

00:25:27.425 --> 00:25:29.027
. IN MY JAIL THE ORANGE JAIL. I

00:25:29.094 --> 00:25:31.363
IN ANY DAY UNDER. POPULATION

00:25:31.429 --> 00:25:33.231
CIRCUMSTANCES PROOF BEFORE

00:25:33.298 --> 00:25:36.034
COVERED. A HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED

00:25:36.101 --> 00:25:37.068
TWENTY PEOPLE ARE BEING

00:25:37.135 --> 00:25:38.169
MEDICALLY SUPERVISED DETOX. OFF

00:25:38.236 --> 00:25:39.871
OF NARCOTICS THEY DIDN'T COME TO

00:25:39.938 --> 00:25:42.040
MY TL TO GET DRUG TREATMENT THEY

00:25:42.107 --> 00:25:43.642
HAPPENED UPON MY JAIL. BREAK RUN

00:25:43.708 --> 00:25:45.310
THE BEST HOSPITAL WE CAN WHILE

00:25:45.377 --> 00:25:47.078
WE HELP THEM. BUT THESE.

00:25:47.145 --> 00:25:50.081
BELIEVES THAT- BIRTH AS A RESULT

00:25:50.148 --> 00:25:51.650
OF PROP FORTY SEVEN PROP FIFTY

00:25:51.716 --> 00:25:53.919
SEVEN OTHERS THAT IF WE HAD-

00:25:53.985 --> 00:25:55.220
OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO GET ON

00:25:55.287 --> 00:25:56.221
TREATMENT THAT'S JUST NOT

00:25:56.288 --> 00:25:58.123
HAPPENING IN THE STATE. AND THIS

00:25:58.189 --> 00:25:59.891
IS NOT AIMED AT THOSE WHO ARE

00:25:59.958 --> 00:26:02.227
ADDICTED THIS IS NAMED AIMED AT

00:26:02.294 --> 00:26:02.928
STOPPING. THE NARCOTIC THE

00:26:02.994 --> 00:26:05.030
KANEMI THAT HAPPENS IN THE

00:26:05.096 --> 00:26:09.467
STATE. WHERE DO YOU DRUG.

00:26:09.534 --> 00:26:10.735
ORGANIZATION SOUTH OF GOING TO

00:26:10.802 --> 00:26:12.771
WRITE THE AND MEET THE- NORTH OF

00:26:12.837 --> 00:26:13.772
THE BORDER. I DON'T LIKE THE

00:26:13.838 --> 00:26:16.474
FACT THAT WE HAVE NARCOTICS

00:26:16.541 --> 00:26:17.075
ADDICTED PEOPLE WITHIN THE JOB

00:26:17.142 --> 00:26:17.776
BUT THEY'RE NOT GETTING

00:26:17.842 --> 00:26:18.710
TREATMENT ON THEIR OWN. ANYMORE

00:26:18.777 --> 00:26:20.478
MORE ADDICTED EVERY DAY. AND IF

00:26:20.545 --> 00:26:22.013
ANYTHING THIS SHOULD BE IN

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.081
PERHAPS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO

00:26:23.148 --> 00:26:24.849
INTERRUPT AND DISRUPT THE DRUG.

00:26:24.916 --> 00:26:26.217
THE DRUG TRAFFICKING. PROBABLY

00:26:26.284 --> 00:26:27.218
TO THE BENEFIT OF SAVING

00:26:27.285 --> 00:26:29.087
CALIFORNIA LIVE TO LEASE TO SLOW

00:26:29.154 --> 00:26:30.922
IT DOWN. IF WE WERE TO DO THAT

00:26:30.989 --> 00:26:33.024
SO I BELIEVE FIRMLY THAT THIS IS

00:26:33.091 --> 00:26:35.093
IN OUR- AN APPROPRIATE. APPROACH

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.028
IN MY BELIEF OF ANNOUNCED

00:26:37.095 --> 00:26:38.763
ALMOST. THIRTY THREE YEARS OF

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:40.732
BEING IN POLICING IN THE STATE.

00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:42.067
THERE HAS TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY

00:26:42.133 --> 00:26:43.668
PASSED THE OFFRAMP JUST YOU WAIT

00:26:43.735 --> 00:26:45.103
TO GET THE DRUGS. THE STOCK

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:47.038
FLOW. FROM SOUTH OF THE BORDER

00:26:47.105 --> 00:26:48.707
TO NORTH OF THE BORDER AND THIS

00:26:48.773 --> 00:26:50.642
IS ONE OF THE KEY. AREAS IN

00:26:50.709 --> 00:26:52.677
WHICH WE CAN DO THAT- AND I

00:26:52.744 --> 00:26:54.012
BELIEVE FROM ME THAT THIS WOULD

00:26:54.079 --> 00:26:55.714
BE AT HAVE A DIRECT POSITIVE

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:56.781
RESULT IF WE WERE TO PASS THIS

00:26:56.848 --> 00:26:59.184
BILL. AND ALL THE CATHOLICS WERE

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:00.685
TRAFFICKING NARCOTICS. NOT THOSE

00:27:00.752 --> 00:27:05.323
WHO ARE THE END USERS. THANK YOU

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:10.762
. YES. SO I LIKE TO FOLLOW UP

00:27:10.829 --> 00:27:11.830
WITH SOME QUESTIONS SOME SOME

00:27:11.896 --> 00:27:15.867
COMMENTS AND- YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN

00:27:15.934 --> 00:27:17.302
ACTUALLY BLESSED TO HAVE AND MET

00:27:17.369 --> 00:27:18.903
CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS IN MY LIFE

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:20.672
THAT I CALL FRIENDS WHO HAVE

00:27:20.739 --> 00:27:24.309
SERVED TIME AND THEY HAVE DONE A

00:27:24.376 --> 00:27:25.143
VARIETY OF THINGS THAT. YOU KNOW

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:27.012
COMPELLED NOT COMPEL THEM BUT-

00:27:27.078 --> 00:27:28.747
DIRECTED THEM TO OUR CRIMINAL

00:27:28.813 --> 00:27:31.249
JUSTICE AND SERVE TIME AND I CAN

00:27:31.316 --> 00:27:33.551
THINK OF A GENTLEMEN- A FRIEND

00:27:33.618 --> 00:27:36.654
OF MINE. WHO WHO SAID YOU KNOW

00:27:36.721 --> 00:27:38.256
THANKS TO THE THREE STRIKES LAW

00:27:38.323 --> 00:27:40.892
I ACTUALLY DID A- CHANGE IN MY

00:27:40.959 --> 00:27:42.560
LIFE BECAUSE HE SERVED TIME HE

00:27:42.627 --> 00:27:44.529
REALIZED THAT IF. HE DID

00:27:44.596 --> 00:27:45.964
SOMETHING ELSE HE WAS GONNA BE

00:27:46.031 --> 00:27:47.899
OUT FOR A LONG TIME AND THIS IS

00:27:47.966 --> 00:27:49.901
A GENTLEMAN WHO. WAS VERY ROUGH

00:27:49.968 --> 00:27:51.903
AND I'LL YOU KNOW I CALL NO MORE

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:52.904
FOR THE VERY NOW BUT- BY YOU

00:27:52.971 --> 00:27:54.706
LOOK AT HIM AND YOU WOULD BE

00:27:54.773 --> 00:27:56.674
VERY INTIMIDATED BECAUSE OF

00:27:56.741 --> 00:27:57.776
THINGS THAT HE'S DONE IN THE WAY

00:27:57.842 --> 00:27:59.644
HE SPEAKS AND SO FORTH BUT- HE

00:27:59.711 --> 00:28:01.046
TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:28:01.112 --> 00:28:02.680
ACCOUNTABILITY AND HAVING

00:28:02.747 --> 00:28:04.215
CERTAIN- PARAMETERS THAT HE HAD

00:28:04.282 --> 00:28:06.484
TO FEAR IN ORDER FOR HIM. SHAPE

00:28:06.551 --> 00:28:08.686
UP IN SANTA I'M GONNA CHANGE MY

00:28:08.753 --> 00:28:10.688
- I THINK OF- PASTOR BRIAN- IN

00:28:10.755 --> 00:28:12.357
MY DISTRICT AS WELL WHO ALSO

00:28:12.424 --> 00:28:14.626
SERVED TIME. AND ALSO SAID YOU

00:28:14.692 --> 00:28:16.327
KNOW THERE WAS A TIME AFTER HE

00:28:16.394 --> 00:28:17.896
WAS. CONVICTED I THINK WAS THE

00:28:17.962 --> 00:28:19.964
SECOND TIME- WHERE HE MET A

00:28:20.031 --> 00:28:21.833
GENTLEMAN AND SAID YOU KNOW I'VE

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:23.535
HAD I NOT HAVE THOSE PARAMETERS

00:28:23.601 --> 00:28:25.270
IN THOSE FEARS I WOULD NOT HAVE.

00:28:25.336 --> 00:28:26.905
DECIDED NO THAT'S NOT THAT'S HOW

00:28:26.971 --> 00:28:28.673
I'M GOING TO END UP WITH DON'T

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.275
YOU MAKE A CHANGE SO THERE

00:28:30.341 --> 00:28:31.843
SOMETIMES AND EVEN AS A PARENT.

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:33.778
YOU KNOW I I'VE READ MANY BOOKS

00:28:33.845 --> 00:28:34.712
AND DISCIPLINE AND TALKS ABOUT

00:28:34.779 --> 00:28:37.348
THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING

00:28:37.415 --> 00:28:37.949
PARAMETERS HAVING- THINGS THAT

00:28:38.016 --> 00:28:39.918
YOU- BOB FRANKEN GOING TO ALL

00:28:39.984 --> 00:28:41.853
THE LITTLE DETAILS BUT IMPORTANT

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.622
HAVING CONSEQUENCES. AND HOLDING

00:28:44.689 --> 00:28:47.559
PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE HAVE YOU.

00:28:47.625 --> 00:28:49.727
FOR- AND THEN. JUST THE WORDS

00:28:49.794 --> 00:28:51.096
THAT IN RIGHT NOW IT'S

00:28:51.162 --> 00:28:52.997
INTERESTING BECAUSE ON ONE SIDE

00:28:53.064 --> 00:28:59.070
WE HAVE A LOT OF. LAWS

00:28:59.137 --> 00:29:00.238
PROHIBITING AND- CREATING MORE

00:29:00.305 --> 00:29:02.140
MORE LAW. WE IT COMES TO. GUN IN

00:29:02.207 --> 00:29:04.175
THE STATE. BECAUSE OF WHAT THE

00:29:04.242 --> 00:29:06.678
INCREASE OF- HOMICIDES OR

00:29:06.744 --> 00:29:08.413
WHATEVER MAYBE YOU KNOW THERE'S

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.215
A TENDENCY TO HAVE THAT IN

00:29:10.281 --> 00:29:13.118
PLACE. BUT YEAH WHEN IT COMES TO

00:29:13.184 --> 00:29:14.586
THIS PARTICULAR. TOPIC WHEN IT

00:29:14.652 --> 00:29:17.455
COMES TO VOTE AND ALL. AND THE-

00:29:17.522 --> 00:29:20.692
DEATHS THAT WE'RE- SCENE. AND

00:29:20.758 --> 00:29:22.660
AND EXPERIENCING WITH ARE YOU

00:29:22.727 --> 00:29:26.498
DYING. JUST THIS WEEK AND I HAVE

SURVATION WAS GONNA SOMEHOW LIKE

00:34:37.141 --> 00:34:41.612
AND THIS IT'S SOMETHING. TO

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:43.915
CONSIDER BUT WE- THE TRAGEDY. A

00:34:43.981 --> 00:34:45.750
SPECIAL IN THE BEATING BILLS

00:34:45.817 --> 00:34:47.819
LIKE THIS IS THAT WE KNOW FROM

00:34:47.885 --> 00:34:51.022
EXPERIENCE. WE KNOW FROM LIKE

00:34:51.088 --> 00:34:53.124
REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE OVER THE

00:34:53.191 --> 00:34:55.560
LAST FIFTY YEARS THAT THESE

00:34:55.626 --> 00:34:57.261
ENHANCEMENTS AND HARSHER ARCHER

00:34:57.328 --> 00:35:01.365
SENSES DON'T ACTUALLY REDUCE

00:35:01.432 --> 00:35:03.167
DRUG USE AND DON'T REDUCE

00:35:03.234 --> 00:35:06.237
OVERDOSES- YOU KNOW WE HAD AN

00:35:06.304 --> 00:35:07.672
NINETEEN EIGHTIES EPIDEMIC OF

00:35:07.738 --> 00:35:10.608
CRACK COCAINE- AND A LOT OF

00:35:10.675 --> 00:35:12.643
WHICH WAS FOR DYING PEOPLE WERE

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:14.679
IT WAS A LOT OF HARM BUT WAS

00:35:14.745 --> 00:35:17.181
COMING. FROM CRACK COCAINE USE

00:35:17.248 --> 00:35:20.284
AND SO IN THIS COUNTRY WE UP THE

00:35:20.351 --> 00:35:22.620
SENSES AND JUST STARTED JUST

00:35:22.687 --> 00:35:25.356
HACKING OUR JAILS- FULL OF

00:35:25.423 --> 00:35:27.892
PEOPLE AND IT DOESN'T REDUCE

00:35:27.959 --> 00:35:29.560
DRUG USE AND NOW WE HAVE

00:35:29.627 --> 00:35:31.529
DIFFERENT DRUGS THAT PEOPLE ARE

00:35:31.596 --> 00:35:33.064
USING AND THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT

00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:36.200
ARE DYING FROM. AND SO I CHEST I

00:35:36.267 --> 00:35:39.670
DON'T THINK THAT THIS APPROACH

00:35:39.737 --> 00:35:41.272
IS ACTUALLY. GOING END UP SAVING

00:35:41.339 --> 00:35:42.974
PEOPLE'S LIVES BECAUSE FROM

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.142

00:35:45.209 --> 00:35:47.345
JAIL SENTENCES OR DON'T END UP

00:35:47.411 --> 00:35:50.081
CHANGING. DRUG USE OF PEOPLE ARE

00:35:50.147 --> 00:35:51.682
IS LONGER IF PEOPLE ARE ADDICTED

00:35:51.749 --> 00:35:54.085
THEY'RE GOING TO USE ARE GONNA

00:35:54.151 --> 00:35:55.620
FIND A WAY TO USE. AND THE

00:35:55.686 --> 00:35:57.688
HARDER WE MAY GET ACTUALLY THE

00:35:57.755 --> 00:35:59.757
MORE DANGEROUS IT IS BECAUSE IT

00:35:59.824 --> 00:36:02.460
BECOMES MORE AND MORE ALYSSA

00:36:02.527 --> 00:36:04.629
ANALYSTS AT PLUS. WAY OFF THE

00:36:04.695 --> 00:36:06.163
BEATEN TRACK AND PEOPLE GET

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:07.865
DESPERATE FOR THE DRUGS AND THAT

00:36:07.932 --> 00:36:09.667

00:36:20.211 --> 00:36:22.947
A WAY FOR THE SUPPLY- TO BE

00:36:23.014 --> 00:36:24.949
THERE AS FAR EVEN IF WE MAKE

00:36:25.016 --> 00:36:27.084
THINGS HARSHER. THIS BILL IN

00:36:27.151 --> 00:36:30.488
ADDITION. DOES GO BEYOND I THINK

00:36:30.555 --> 00:36:33.591

SYNTHETIC FOOD SO MUCH CHEAPER-

00:38:31.175 --> 00:38:33.678
AND SO WE NEED MORE AGGRESSIVE

00:38:33.744 --> 00:38:36.914
AND STRATEGIES BUT I THEY NEED

00:38:36.981 --> 00:38:38.082

IT IS IT'S A SYNTHETIC IT IS

00:40:02.933 --> 00:40:04.835

ISSUE. A SIR CALM WATER YEAH ME

00:47:50.267 --> 00:47:52.603
AND I ALSO JUST THINK I THINK

00:47:52.669 --> 00:47:53.437
THERE'S ALSO A DIFFERENCE

00:47:53.503 --> 00:47:55.472
BETWEEN BETWEEN SELLERS

00:47:55.539 --> 00:47:58.809
MANUFACTURERS AND DISTRIBUTORS

00:47:58.875 --> 00:48:01.578
AND YOU KNOW. THE DOPE GAME IS

00:48:01.645 --> 00:48:04.514
ACTUALLY A VERY HIERARCHICAL AND

00:48:04.581 --> 00:48:06.450
INCREDIBLY COMPLEX AND THERE ARE

00:48:06.516 --> 00:48:09.186
FIREWALLS BETWEEN EACH STEP IN

00:48:09.253 --> 00:48:11.955
THE GAME AND SO I AM INCREDIBLY

00:48:12.022 --> 00:48:14.825
INTERESTED IN A POLICY THAT WE

00:48:14.891 --> 00:48:16.526
COULD CRAFT AT THE STATE LEVEL

00:48:16.593 --> 00:48:17.327
THAT COULD PROBABLY BE

00:48:17.394 --> 00:48:18.395
COORDINATED WITH FEDERAL.

00:48:18.462 --> 00:48:19.730
AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS TO

00:48:19.796 --> 00:48:22.299
ALLOW US TO GET TO THE HEAD OF

00:48:22.366 --> 00:48:24.234
THE SNAKE AND I DON'T SEE HOW

00:48:24.301 --> 00:48:26.536
THIS ACTUALLY BY PASSES CORNER

00:48:26.603 --> 00:48:28.272
HUSTLERS AND OTHER FOLKS WHO ARE

00:48:28.338 --> 00:48:30.574
LIKE YOU KNOW HAVING A PIECE OF-

00:48:30.641 --> 00:48:31.975
YOU KNOW A PARTICULAR

00:48:32.042 --> 00:48:33.343
NEIGHBORHOOD OR COMMUNITY OR OR

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:35.746
OR SWAP OF REAL ESTATE. TO GET

00:48:35.812 --> 00:48:38.982
TO THE FOLKS WHO ARE MASSIVELY.

00:48:39.049 --> 00:48:44.354
MANUFACTURING THIS KILLER DRUG I

00:48:44.421 --> 00:48:46.990
MEAN I THINK THAT'S HOW YOU GET

00:48:47.057 --> 00:48:48.592
TO IT AND WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

00:48:48.659 --> 00:48:50.527
STORIES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:48:50.594 --> 00:48:52.829
AGENCIES YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO

00:48:52.896 --> 00:48:55.165
GET TO THOSE FOLKS AND SO THE

00:48:55.232 --> 00:48:57.200
MIDDLE MEN AND THE FOLKS ON THE

00:48:57.267 --> 00:48:59.536
STREET THOSE PEOPLE ARE A DIME A

00:48:59.603 --> 00:49:01.872
DOZEN THEY CAN BE REPLACED THEY

00:49:01.938 --> 00:49:02.906
CAN BE REPLACED THEY CAN BE

00:49:02.973 --> 00:49:05.242
REPLACED AND WE'RE ON A HAMSTER

00:49:05.309 --> 00:49:06.843
WHEEL OF TRYING TO GET THOSE

00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:09.046
PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS WHEN AND

00:49:09.112 --> 00:49:12.182
HOW YOU CAN CREATE POLICY THAT

00:49:12.249 --> 00:49:13.550
WILL GIVE THE AMMUNITION THAT IS

00:49:13.617 --> 00:49:16.053
NEEDED TO LONG FOR SMITH. TO GET

00:49:16.119 --> 00:49:17.521
TO THE FOLKS AT THE TOP SO

00:49:17.587 --> 00:49:19.256
THAT'S HOW I THINK ABOUT THIS

00:49:19.323 --> 00:49:21.525
WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING

00:49:21.591 --> 00:49:24.761
ON- AND I BELIEVE THAT FOLKS

00:49:24.828 --> 00:49:27.864
KNOW. I MEAN I THINK PEOPLE

00:49:27.931 --> 00:49:31.134
KNOW- WHO. THE PEOPLE ARE SORT

00:49:31.201 --> 00:49:34.204
OF MANAGING THE CARTELS- AND SO

00:49:34.271 --> 00:49:35.205
I THINK IT DOES REQUIRE

00:49:35.272 --> 00:49:36.673
SOMETHING MUCH MORE

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:38.842
SOPHISTICATED AND ALSO HONEST

00:49:38.909 --> 00:49:40.544
ABOUT YOU KNOW THE OBSTACLES

00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:42.145
THAT WE ARE ALL UP AGAINST IF

00:49:42.212 --> 00:49:43.780
WE'RE TRYING TO ATTACK THIS

00:49:43.847 --> 00:49:45.649
PROBLEM AND I ALSO THINK THERE

00:49:45.716 --> 00:49:46.817
IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT

00:49:46.883 --> 00:49:47.984
YOU'RE DOING TO MANAGE THOSE WHO

00:49:48.051 --> 00:49:49.653
ARE ADDICTED. AND THEN THOSE WHO

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:51.555
ARE REALLY AT THE TOP WHO ARE

00:49:51.621 --> 00:49:52.089
CONTROLLING BILLIONS AND

00:49:52.155 --> 00:49:54.691
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS- AND ARE NOT

00:49:54.758 --> 00:49:56.860
THE ONES OFTENTIMES THAT ARE

00:49:56.927 --> 00:49:58.795
GETTING ARRESTED AND GOING THAT-

00:49:58.862 --> 00:50:00.464
STATE OR FEDERAL PRISON. GUARD

PERSISTENCE IN THIS ISSUE AND I

00:50:07.871 --> 00:50:08.905
DON'T THINK IT'S SINGLE MEMBER

00:50:08.972 --> 00:50:11.141
HERE REGARDLESS OF YOUR VOTE WHO

00:50:11.208 --> 00:50:12.743

00:50:14.745 --> 00:50:15.712
FENTANYL OFF THE STREET BUT I

00:50:15.779 --> 00:50:17.180
THINK IF WE'VE LEARNED ANYTHING

00:50:17.247 --> 00:50:18.949
OVER THE LAST FORTY YEARS. THE

00:50:19.015 --> 00:50:20.350
WAR DRUGS JUST HASN'T WORKED

00:50:20.417 --> 00:50:21.952

HEROIN AND COCAINE USE IT IS

00:50:27.524 --> 00:50:29.292
BECAUSE FUNDING WAS FARM CHEAPER

00:50:29.359 --> 00:50:31.695
THAN HEROIN AND COCAINE. AND

00:50:31.762 --> 00:50:33.597
IT'S BEING MADE AVAILABLE AT A

00:50:33.663 --> 00:50:36.933

TO KILL THEIR CLIENTELE. I MEAN

00:50:50.881 --> 00:50:52.382

MULTIPLE TIMES. HE IS SO YEAH

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:33.757
I'D SOLD POINT IS HERE. WHAT WE

00:51:33.824 --> 00:51:35.258
I THINK ADDICTION IS AN ISSUE

00:51:35.325 --> 00:51:37.127
HERE AND WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH

00:51:37.194 --> 00:51:42.132

THE STREET FOLKS I MEAN WE THERE

00:51:47.237 --> 00:51:48.805

DIDN'T STOP COCAINE USE AGAIN

00:52:00.217 --> 00:52:02.419
THE FACT THAT THIS IS CHEAP IT'S

00:52:02.486 --> 00:52:04.254
READILY AVAILABLE IS WHY WE HAVE

00:52:04.321 --> 00:52:05.822
THIS ACT UP BACK AT THE

00:52:05.889 --> 00:52:07.891
DEMOCRATS SHOULD TODAY OF DEATH

ON THE STREET AND- WE SHOULD ALL

00:52:10.594 --> 00:52:12.896
BE CONCERNED BUT AGAIN I JUST

00:52:12.963 --> 00:52:16.199

DISCUSSION NOW SPIRITED ONE. I

00:52:22.572 --> 00:52:24.307
JUST WANT TO MAKE A FEW CLOSING

00:52:24.374 --> 00:52:26.643

00:52:32.983 --> 00:52:34.618
MANUFACTURING THESE HUGE AMOUNTS

00:52:34.684 --> 00:52:36.386
AND GETTING THEM INTO OUR

00:52:36.453 --> 00:52:37.153
COUNTRY. ARE IS A VERY

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:38.788
INTERESTING COMMENT THIS COME UP

00:52:38.855 --> 00:52:40.957
ABOUT THE SUPPLY. WHEN YOU LIMIT

00:52:41.024 --> 00:52:43.093
THE SUPPLY THE COST OF THE

00:52:43.159 --> 00:52:43.727
PRODUCT GOES UP WE'RE SEEING

00:52:43.793 --> 00:52:45.161
THAT WITH GAS RIGHT. SAME

00:52:45.228 --> 00:52:46.730
PRINCIPLE HERE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

00:52:46.796 --> 00:52:48.198
TRYING TO DO IS WE'RE TRYING TO

00:52:48.265 --> 00:52:49.866
LIMIT THE SUPPLY REDUCE THE

00:52:49.933 --> 00:52:51.801
SUPPLY AND THE SUPPLY. IN WE

00:52:51.868 --> 00:52:53.837
CAN'T DO THAT UNLESS WE START IF

00:52:53.904 --> 00:52:55.672
WE LOOK AT A PYRAMID. YOU START

00:52:55.739 --> 00:52:56.673
WITH THE BOTTOM LEVEL OF THE

00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:57.807
PYRAMID AND YOU START

00:52:57.874 --> 00:52:59.643
ELIMINATING ONE BY ONE BY ONE

00:52:59.709 --> 00:53:01.912
INTO YOU FINALLY GET TO THE TOP

00:53:01.978 --> 00:53:03.813
AND I WOULD ASSUME THAT'S GOING

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:04.848
TO BE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. BUT

00:53:04.915 --> 00:53:06.550
IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING TO

00:53:06.616 --> 00:53:07.684
START AT THAT LEVEL AND LIMIT

00:53:07.751 --> 00:53:09.553
THE SUPPLY THIS BEING AVAILABLE

00:53:09.619 --> 00:53:10.754
TO OUR STREETS YOU KNOW

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:14.224
MERCHANTS. ARE IT WILL NOT STOP

00:53:14.291 --> 00:53:16.560
THIS INCREASE THAT WE SEAT TWO

00:53:16.626 --> 00:53:18.562
HUNDRED AND ONE PERCENT. OF WHEN

01:40:08.836 --> 01:40:11.205
PROBATION. AS A DOES IT CREATE

01:40:11.271 --> 01:40:15.376
YET ONE MORE BASIS TO REVOKE

01:40:15.442 --> 01:40:16.477

ALREADY PUT IN PLACE AFTER A

01:40:21.215 --> 01:40:23.150
COURT ORDER TO ORDER EDUCATION

01:40:23.217 --> 01:40:24.752
OR TREATMENT. THE PROBLEM WITH

THE WAY THE CURRENT LAW IF THAT

01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:29.123
UP. UNFORTUNATELY WHAT IT PUTS

01:40:29.189 --> 01:40:31.091
THE ONUS ON IT ON A DEFENDANT.

01:40:31.158 --> 01:40:32.993
WHO'S GOING ON PROBATION THE

01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:34.762
FEET AND MAINTAIN THEIR OWN

01:40:34.828 --> 01:40:36.997
TREATMENT. THAT THAT PART ABOUT

01:40:37.064 --> 01:40:38.866
THAT IS THAT OFTENTIMES IN

01:40:38.932 --> 01:40:40.567
UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. THEY

01:40:40.634 --> 01:40:42.302
DON'T HAVE ACCESS TREATMENT THIS

01:40:42.369 --> 01:40:43.170
WOULD ACTUALLY PUTS THE ONUS

01:40:43.237 --> 01:40:44.738

TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF

01:40:52.546 --> 01:40:53.647
RECOVERING FROM THE ADDICTION

01:40:53.714 --> 01:40:55.749
AND TRY TO FIND THEIR OWN

01:40:55.816 --> 01:40:56.984
TREATMENT. AND WHAT WE'RE REALLY

01:40:57.050 --> 01:41:00.387
SPEAKING TO- INSURER IS THE ONE

01:41:00.454 --> 01:41:02.890

THERE ARE SOME COUNTIES.

01:46:05.058 --> 01:46:07.394
DEPENDING ON WHO PARTICIPATES IN

SOME WORK ON THIS OR SOME REAL

01:46:22.008 --> 01:46:22.576
SHADY. OPERATORS AND THEIR

01:46:22.642 --> 01:46:25.979
PEOPLE TO USE NON SCIENCE BASED

01:46:26.046 --> 01:46:27.881
. APPROACH AS I JUST WORRY THAT

01:46:27.948 --> 01:46:29.683
DEPENDING ON WHAT COUNTY IS AN

01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:31.284
UNFORTUNATE IN THE COUNTIES.

01:46:31.351 --> 01:46:34.254
THAT ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE YOU

01:46:34.321 --> 01:46:35.322
KNOW PURSUING HARSHER DRUG

01:46:35.388 --> 01:46:37.224
PENALTIES ARE ALSO THE ONES.

01:46:37.290 --> 01:46:38.492
THAT ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE

01:46:38.558 --> 01:46:41.261
PURSUING OPTIONS ONLY- OR

01:46:41.328 --> 01:46:44.064
ABSTINENCE FOCUSED ON JUST CALL

01:46:44.131 --> 01:46:46.032
AND POINTED OUT IT'S I THINK THE

01:46:46.099 --> 01:46:49.002
REALITY- AND SO I THINK THIS.

01:46:49.069 --> 01:46:50.303
WOULD BE SOME TIGHTENING FELT

01:46:50.370 --> 01:46:52.239
THE LONG TO SHORT IS THE MMC

01:46:52.305 --> 01:46:54.741
MADE UP HERE. MOVING IN THE

01:46:54.808 --> 01:46:55.976
RIGHT DIRECTION I REALLY

01:46:56.042 --> 01:46:58.445
APPRECIATE APPRECIATE IT- I

01:46:58.512 --> 01:46:59.980
THINK WITH THE WAY IT IS RIGHT

01:47:00.046 --> 01:47:04.050
NOW IT'S NOT TIGHT ENOUGH FOR ME

01:47:04.117 --> 01:47:06.486
AND I WORRY THAT I COULD GO. NOT

01:47:06.553 --> 01:47:08.088
BE IMPLEMENTED PROPERLY AND SO

01:47:08.155 --> 01:47:09.089
IF BROUGH WITH BOAT. THIS

01:47:09.156 --> 01:47:11.525
LANGUAGE RIGHT NOW I THINK I

01:47:11.591 --> 01:47:13.226
DON'T THINK I COULD SUPPORT

01:47:13.293 --> 01:47:15.195
TODAY IF IT WERE TO LEAD TO A

01:47:15.262 --> 01:47:15.996
FUTURE HEARING. WITH SOME MORE

01:47:16.062 --> 01:47:18.598
WORK ON THE LANGUAGE- I MIGHT BE

01:47:18.665 --> 01:47:21.401
ABLE TO GET THERE SO I JUST WANT

01:47:21.468 --> 01:47:23.436
TO PUT THAT OUT. I WILL LAUGH AT

01:47:23.503 --> 01:47:24.971
THIS BECAUSE IT'S IDENTICAL TO

01:47:25.038 --> 01:47:26.807
THE LANGUAGE THAT IN THE MENTAL

01:47:26.873 --> 01:47:28.809
HEALTH DIVERSION STATUTE- THAT

01:47:28.875 --> 01:47:30.544

FROM SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT

01:47:33.313 --> 01:47:34.447
PROVIDERS UNDER PENAL CODE

01:47:34.514 --> 01:47:36.016
SECTION TWELVE ELEVEN. BILL WAS

01:47:36.082 --> 01:47:38.018
PUT IN THERE TO NEARTHAT BUT

01:47:38.084 --> 01:47:39.152
THAT WAY ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS

01:47:39.219 --> 01:47:40.754
HAD A STAKE. IN DETERMINING THE

01:47:40.821 --> 01:47:42.022
APPROPRIATE TREATMENT PROGRAM

01:47:42.088 --> 01:47:43.623
SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'VE USED FOR

01:47:43.690 --> 01:47:45.292
DRUG DIVERSION. SO IN THOSE

01:47:45.358 --> 01:47:47.761
OTHER ONES IN THE DECIDER IS- HE

01:47:47.828 --> 01:47:49.095

IS THE DRUG PROGRAM COUNTY DRUG

01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:55.435
PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR. BECAUSE

HERE THAT THEY'RE NOT THE

01:47:57.604 --> 01:48:00.473
DECISION MAKER. IT'S LIKE A CELL

01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:01.374
THEIR PROCESS. WITH PROBATE

01:48:01.441 --> 01:48:02.642
APART EVERYONE ELSE IT DOESN'T

01:48:02.709 --> 01:48:05.412
WHO DECIDES. ULTIMATELY GOING TO

01:48:05.478 --> 01:48:07.247
BE ON PROBATION AS WELL OF THE

01:48:07.314 --> 01:48:08.548
COURT BUT THE PROGRAMS

01:48:08.615 --> 01:48:10.050
THEMSELVES WILL BE WILL BE

01:48:10.116 --> 01:48:12.919
DEVELOPED- BY THE COUNTY DRUG

01:48:12.986 --> 01:48:14.487
ADMINISTRATOR WITH INPUT FROM

01:48:14.554 --> 01:48:16.089
THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE. TREATMENT

01:48:16.156 --> 01:48:18.458
PROVIDERS SO AGAIN IT'S GONNA

01:48:18.525 --> 01:48:20.560
EXACTLY NEAR RIGHT NOW WHAT WE

01:48:20.627 --> 01:48:21.862
HAVE IN THE DRUG DIVERSION

01:48:21.928 --> 01:48:24.397
STATUTE. SO THAT WAY IF THE SAME

01:48:24.464 --> 01:48:25.899
TYPE OF TREATMENT PROGRAMS

01:48:25.966 --> 01:48:27.100
THEY'RE GONNA BE PROVIDED AS A

01:48:27.167 --> 01:48:29.135
BEING PROVIDED A DIVERSION. SO

01:48:29.202 --> 01:48:30.904
THAT AND AGAIN PROBATION WOULD

01:48:30.971 --> 01:48:32.906
ULTIMATELY BE THE ONE WHO WOULD.

01:48:32.973 --> 01:48:34.808
BE AND LOCATE THOSE PROGRAMS FOR

01:48:34.875 --> 01:48:36.176
THE DEFENDANT BUT ULTIMATELY THE

01:48:36.243 --> 01:48:37.577
COURT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO

01:48:37.644 --> 01:48:39.079
MAKE THE ULTIMATE DETERMINATION

01:48:39.145 --> 01:48:40.847
<u>S TO WHETHER OR NOT THAT THE</u>

01:48:40.914 --> 01:48:43.216
APPROPRIATE PROGRAM AT THE

01:48:43.283 --> 01:48:45.151

THANK YOU TO YOUR ARM. I DON'T

01:48:53.293 --> 01:48:55.395
THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA FOR THE

01:48:55.462 --> 01:48:59.165
LEGISLATURE TO. PUT INTO STATUTE

01:48:59.232 --> 01:49:03.103
CONTENT OF SUCH PROGRAMS BECAUSE

01:49:03.169 --> 01:49:08.541
THAT IS NOT OUR EXPERTISE. SAY

01:49:08.608 --> 01:49:11.311
THAT TO ESTABLISH DIVERSION

01:49:11.378 --> 01:49:14.080
PROGRAMS TO ESTABLISH THAT THERE

01:49:14.147 --> 01:49:16.116
SHOULD BE OPTIONS FOR TREATMENT

01:49:16.182 --> 01:49:18.318
BUT TO DEFINE THE CURRICULUM OF

01:49:18.385 --> 01:49:20.754
IT IS NOT OUR EXPERTISE AND MY

01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:23.290
EXPERIENCE PASSED. THERE ARE

01:49:23.356 --> 01:49:26.660
PASSED STATUTES WHERE WE IN FACT

01:49:26.726 --> 01:49:28.194
THE LEGISLATURE DICTATED WHAT

01:49:28.261 --> 01:49:30.897
THE CURRICULUM WAS AND THEY HAVE

01:49:30.964 --> 01:49:34.034
A WORK. BECAUSE EXPERTISE AND

01:49:34.100 --> 01:49:37.137
THAT'S WHAT I TAKE FROM THE-

01:49:37.203 --> 01:49:39.005
SOME OF THE OPPOSITION NOT ALL

01:49:39.072 --> 01:49:41.341
IT'S NOT OUR DECISION TO

01:49:41.408 --> 01:49:44.844
TREATMENT PER SE IT IS TO

01:49:44.911 --> 01:49:47.113
DEFINING WHAT THAT. WHAT THE

01:49:47.180 --> 01:49:49.616
CURRICULUM IS OR HOW IT'S HOW IT

01:49:49.683 --> 01:49:53.186
IS DONE AND SO- AND IT SEEMS

01:49:53.253 --> 01:49:56.189
BECAUSE THE BILL PART OF IT'S MY

01:49:56.256 --> 01:49:58.091
MOTIVATION IS TO GET THAT VERY

01:49:58.158 --> 01:50:02.162

TO BE AWARE FEDERAL THOUGH I

01:50:05.999 --> 01:50:07.334
DON'T THINK THAT THIS

01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:09.769
PARTICULAR. MECHANISM IS THE

01:50:09.836 --> 01:50:11.938
RIGHT WAY TO GO FOR US TO PUT

01:50:12.005 --> 01:50:14.207
INTO STATUTE DATE THE CURRICULUM

01:50:14.274 --> 01:50:17.377
OF THE PROGRAM SO I'M I CAN'T

01:50:17.444 --> 01:50:19.346
SUPPORT IT AS WRITTEN. I DON'T

01:50:19.412 --> 01:50:21.181
SEE THAT WE PUT INTO STATUTE A

01:50:21.247 --> 01:50:24.017
CURRICULUM WE PUT INTO STATUTE-

01:50:24.084 --> 01:50:26.219
A- PROCESS BY WHICH THEY WILL

01:50:26.286 --> 01:50:28.822
DEVELOP A PROGRAM THAT MEETS THE

01:50:28.888 --> 01:50:32.592
CORDS- IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW

01:50:32.659 --> 01:50:34.794
SENTENCING AND JOG. FOR THEIR

01:50:34.861 --> 01:50:37.130
VERSION- IF OF A PROGRAM THAT

01:50:37.197 --> 01:50:38.698
PEOPLE WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR

01:50:38.765 --> 01:50:40.734
THEM BUT WE'RE NOT SAYING IT HAS

01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:41.801
TO BE EXPLAINS THE IN TERMS OF

01:50:41.868 --> 01:50:44.637
WHAT THE CONTENT AS I THINK IT'S

01:50:44.704 --> 01:50:45.905
VERY IMPORTANT FOR OUR TREATMENT

01:50:45.972 --> 01:50:47.173
PROVIDERS TO HAVE A GREAT IT

01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:48.541

01:50:48.608 --> 01:50:50.877
ON BEST PRACTICES. OF THINGS

01:50:50.944 --> 01:50:52.078
THAT ARE ARE WORKING SCIENCE

01:50:52.145 --> 01:50:53.947

A PROGRAM THAT IS AVAILABLE YES

01:51:00.887 --> 01:51:02.355
BUT I ALSO FIND SOUND DEFINES

01:51:02.422 --> 01:51:03.890
THE NUMBER OF HOURS TO DEFINE

01:51:03.957 --> 01:51:05.458
DEFINES A VARIETY OF THINGS

01:51:05.525 --> 01:51:07.293
WHICH IN EFFECT. WELL MAYBE IT'S

01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:10.363
NOT THE TOTAL CONTENT IS STILL

01:51:10.430 --> 01:51:12.932
IT IS STILL GOING INTO AN ARENA

01:51:12.999 --> 01:51:17.270

01:51:17.337 --> 01:51:20.240

BECAUSE THERE IS- WE HAVE

01:53:56.896 --> 01:53:58.331
CURRENT PROVISION IN OUR LAW.

01:53:58.398 --> 01:54:01.935
THAT WOULD. RESTRICT THE ABILITY

01:54:02.001 --> 01:54:03.903
FOR A PERSON WHO IS NOT A

WITHIN OUR BUSINESS AND

01:54:36.369 --> 01:54:38.671
PROFESSIONS CODE A WHOLE VARIETY

01:54:38.738 --> 01:54:41.641
OF THINGS BUT BECAUSE OF THE WAY

01:54:41.708 --> 01:54:44.310
OUR STATUTE AS WRITTEN YOU WOULD

01:54:44.377 --> 01:54:46.346
NOT BE ABLE TO BE A PEACE

01:54:46.412 --> 01:54:48.081
OFFICER. AND SO WHAT MY BILL

01:54:48.147 --> 01:54:52.352
WOULD DO AND THERE'S A- IT DOES

01:54:52.418 --> 01:54:56.089
NOT ALLOW FOR ANY PERSON WHO IS

01:54:56.155 --> 01:54:58.725
UNDOCUMENTED OR NON CITIZEN TO

01:54:58.791 --> 01:55:01.227
BECOME A POLICE OFFICER THIS

01:55:01.294 --> 01:55:03.496
BILL IS SUCCESSFUL BUT RATHER.

01:55:03.563 --> 01:55:05.498
YOU MUST BE A PERSON IS LEGALLY

01:55:05.565 --> 01:55:07.800
AUTHORIZED TO WORK. YOU HAVE

01:55:07.867 --> 01:55:10.637
THAT LEGAL PAPERWORK. AND THEN

01:55:10.703 --> 01:55:12.205
IN CALIFORNIA IF THIS BILL

01:55:12.272 --> 01:55:14.807
PASSES YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO BE A

01:55:14.874 --> 01:55:16.909
SWORN OFFICER. SO THAT'S ITS

01:55:16.976 --> 01:55:21.281
INTENT. AND THE- SO WE MIGHT SAY

01:55:21.347 --> 01:55:23.716
WELL WHY WOULD IT NOT BE WHY

01:55:23.783 --> 01:55:25.118
DON'T WE STILL REQUIRE THEM TO

01:55:25.184 --> 01:55:27.587
PURSUE CITIZENSHIP. BUT ACTUALLY

01:55:27.654 --> 01:55:29.122
THERE'S MANY REASONS WHY SOME

01:55:29.188 --> 01:55:30.490
PEOPLE DO NOT PURSUE

01:55:30.556 --> 01:55:32.659
CITIZENSHIP. THERE'S IF YOU

01:55:32.725 --> 01:55:34.260
HAPPEN TO BE FROM A COUNTRY THAT

01:55:34.327 --> 01:55:38.064
WOULD ALLOW YOU TO RETAIN YOUR

01:55:38.131 --> 01:55:40.366
YOUR EXISTING CITIZENSHIP A U.

01:55:40.433 --> 01:55:41.768
S. CITIZEN THAT'S YOU KNOW

01:55:41.834 --> 01:55:43.436
THAT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR PEOPLE

01:55:43.503 --> 01:55:44.871
BUT IN SOME COUNTRIES YOU HAVE

01:55:44.937 --> 01:55:47.540
TO DENOUNCE IT ENTIRELY. THERE'S

01:55:47.607 --> 01:55:50.810
ALSO- CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE I MEAN

01:55:50.877 --> 01:55:52.312
THERE'S ANY NUMBER OF

01:55:52.378 --> 01:55:52.845
CIRCUSTANCES WHERE SOMEONE

01:55:52.912 --> 01:55:54.547
CHOOSES TO RETAIN THE

01:55:54.614 --> 01:55:55.848
CITIZENSHIP OF THEIR HOME

01:55:55.915 --> 01:55:57.884
COUNTRY BUT THEY ARE PERMANENT

01:55:57.950 --> 01:56:02.255
RESIDENTS HERE. AND SO. THIS

01:56:02.322 --> 01:56:04.590
WOULD ALLOW FOR THEM TO BE. A

01:56:04.657 --> 01:56:06.125
SWORN OFFICER WHICH OF COURSE

01:56:06.192 --> 01:56:08.361
WOULD HELP US WITH THAT CULTURAL

01:56:08.428 --> 01:56:10.563
ISSUES DIVERSITY ISSUES IF

01:56:10.630 --> 01:56:12.065
YOU'VE GROWN UP IN- YOU KNOW

01:56:12.131 --> 01:56:14.567
CERTAIN COMMUNITY AND YOU WANT

01:56:14.634 --> 01:56:17.737
TO SERVE IN THEIR COMMUNITY. THE

01:56:17.804 --> 01:56:20.073
THIS PROVISION AND THE OTHER

01:56:20.139 --> 01:56:21.207
INTERESTING THING IS THIS

01:56:21.274 --> 01:56:24.143
PROVISION WAS NOT IN OUR LAW

01:56:24.210 --> 01:56:27.547
FROM THE TIME WE STARTED OUR-

01:56:27.613 --> 01:56:29.682
POLICE OFFICERS IT WAS ADDED.

01:56:29.749 --> 01:56:31.784
AND I HAVE DEEP TO FIND THE- OF

01:56:31.851 --> 01:56:33.553
GET TO THE YEAR IT WAS ADDED YOU

01:56:33.619 --> 01:56:36.055
KNOW SO WAS SEMI RECENTLY WITHIN

01:56:36.122 --> 01:56:38.858
THE LAST- TWENTY THE LAST THIRTY

01:56:38.925 --> 01:56:42.028
OR SO YEARS. ANYWAY I WANT TO

01:56:42.095 --> 01:56:44.697
HAVE MY- PEOPLE AND WHO ARE MY

01:56:44.764 --> 01:56:46.666
EXPERTS TO BE ABLE TO TESTIFY

01:56:46.733 --> 01:56:50.236
BUT I WANTED TO RAISE THAT. WHEN

01:56:50.303 --> 01:56:52.372
WHEN WE GET INTO THE DISCUSSION

01:56:52.438 --> 01:56:54.307
THERE SPEND SOME CONCERNS ABOUT.

01:56:54.374 --> 01:56:56.376
WHAT WHAT WOULD THIS PREVENT

01:56:56.442 --> 01:56:58.845
SOMEONE FROM BEING ABLE TO TRUST

01:56:58.911 --> 01:57:00.913
TO GET A BACKGROUND CHECK AND BY

01:57:00.980 --> 01:57:03.182
NO MEANS IN MY TRYING TO CARRY A

01:57:03.249 --> 01:57:04.517
BILL THAT WOULD. CAUSE SOMEONE

01:57:04.584 --> 01:57:06.018
TO BE ABLE TO BE A SWORN OFFICER

01:57:06.085 --> 01:57:08.020
WHO WE COULD NOT DO A BACKGROUND

01:57:08.087 --> 01:57:10.423
CHECK ON ME WE OBVIOUSLY KNOW

01:57:10.490 --> 01:57:11.491
THAT MANY OF THE PROFESSIONS.

01:57:11.557 --> 01:57:15.528
THAT ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE TO

01:57:15.595 --> 01:57:17.096
PEOPLE IN THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCE

01:57:17.163 --> 01:57:18.765
WERE LEGALLY AVAILABLE TO WORK

01:57:18.831 --> 01:57:20.533
THEY HAD TO PASS BACKGROUND

01:57:20.600 --> 01:57:21.934
CHECKS SO I KNOW THAT THERE IS A

01:57:22.001 --> 01:57:23.936
WAY THAT WE CAN CONSTRUCT THIS

01:57:24.003 --> 01:57:26.172
THAT WOULD GIVE THE ABILITY FOR.

01:57:26.239 --> 01:57:28.474
A PERSON WHO IF WE'RE SUCCESSFUL

01:57:28.541 --> 01:57:30.209
WITH THAT CHANGE IN LAW THAT

01:57:30.276 --> 01:57:31.911
WE'RE TRYING TO WOULD HAVE TO

01:57:31.978 --> 01:57:33.780

01:57:33.846 --> 01:57:35.348
BACKGROUND CHECK DONE ON THEM IT

01:57:35.415 --> 01:57:37.417

BUDGET AT IKE FIFTY FIVE. I

02:11:51.703 --> 02:11:53.972

ONE OR THIRTEEN- GRADUATES I

02:11:59.711 --> 02:12:00.979
THOUGHT BECAUSE IT THE CITY

BUDGETED FOR SMALLER CLASSES

02:12:02.681 --> 02:12:04.583

02:12:26.104 --> 02:12:27.773

02:12:30.742 --> 02:12:31.943

TRAINING THAT EVERYONE ELSE-

02:12:44.756 --> 02:12:47.626
GOES THROUGH. AND I THINK WE

02:12:47.693 --> 02:12:48.760
SHOULD GIVE OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:12:48.827 --> 02:12:50.128
AGENCIES THAT ABILITY I ALSO DO

02:12:50.195 --> 02:12:51.863

YOU'RE GOING TO USE THAT

02:13:02.841 --> 02:13:04.209

OUR THE UNITED STATES OF

AMERICA- AND- I DON'T THINK

02:13:08.513 --> 02:13:11.216
THAT. DENYING THEM YOU KNOW SOME

02:13:11.283 --> 02:13:12.084
OF SOMEONE WANTS TO DO SOMETHING

02:13:12.150 --> 02:13:13.852
BAD. TO SAY WELL WE'RE NOT GONNA

POLICE OFFICERS WHO WERE PART OF

02:13:30.869 --> 02:13:32.604
THAT INSURRECTION. SO THE IDEA

02:13:32.671 --> 02:13:34.673
THAT IF WE JUST LIMIT POLICE

02:13:34.740 --> 02:13:38.643

02:13:38.710 --> 02:13:40.746

02:13:40.812 --> 02:13:42.381
YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT IF PEOPLE

02:13:42.447 --> 02:13:44.583
WANT TO DO SOMETHING BAD. SUCH

02:13:44.649 --> 02:13:46.118
AS TRY TO OVERTHROW THE US

02:13:46.184 --> 02:13:47.753
GOVERNMENT ON THEY CAN DO THAT

02:13:47.819 --> 02:13:49.287
EVEN IF THEY'RE CITIZENS AND

02:13:49.354 --> 02:13:50.989
UNFORTUNATELY A LARGE NUMBER OF

02:13:51.056 --> 02:13:53.058
CITIZENS DID- TRY TO VIOLENTLY

02:13:53.125 --> 02:13:54.226
OVERTHROW THE UNITED STATES

02:13:54.292 --> 02:14:00.565

02:15:28.220 --> 02:15:30.989
ON SO MANY FRONTS. AND SO THAT'S

02:15:31.056 --> 02:15:33.959
WHY I EAT AMID ADVOCATE FOR

02:15:34.025 --> 02:15:36.061
LEGAL IMMIGRATION IN A REFORM

02:15:36.127 --> 02:15:37.829
IMMIGRATION POLICIES IN THIS

02:15:37.896 --> 02:15:38.930
COUNTRY BECAUSE I THINK THERE

02:15:38.997 --> 02:15:41.166
ARE TRULY OUTDATED AND TALK

02:15:41.233 --> 02:15:43.401
ABOUT OUTDATED- YOU KNOW.

02:15:43.468 --> 02:15:45.971
PROCESSES AND- THOUGHT I MEET

02:15:46.037 --> 02:15:48.607
OUR OUR- OUR IMMIGRATION PROCESS

02:15:48.673 --> 02:15:51.710
IS OUTDATED IN THE WEEK WE

02:15:51.776 --> 02:15:54.246
LEGALIZE WE INTEGRATE. ONE

02:15:54.312 --> 02:15:55.647
MILLION IMMIGRANTS A YEAR

02:15:55.714 --> 02:15:58.283
LEGALLY INTO THIS COUNTRY- THEY

02:15:58.350 --> 02:16:00.051
ARE AT LOT OF LOOPHOLES AND I A

02:16:00.118 --> 02:16:01.586
LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH IMMIGRATION

02:16:01.653 --> 02:16:03.889
HAS AND MAKES A VERY LENGTHY AND

02:16:03.955 --> 02:16:05.090
FOR SOME PEOPLE THEY'RE LIVING

02:16:05.156 --> 02:16:05.991
IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD

02:16:06.057 --> 02:16:08.326
MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM

02:16:08.393 --> 02:16:09.628
TO. HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE

02:16:09.694 --> 02:16:12.898
HERE BUT- MY MAIN CONCERN IS THE

02:16:12.964 --> 02:16:14.399
FACT THAT WHEN WE HAVE

02:16:14.466 --> 02:16:16.001
UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE LIVING IN

02:16:16.067 --> 02:16:17.736
OUR COUNTRY IT DOES LEAVE

02:16:17.802 --> 02:16:20.438
VULNERABLE TO EXPLOITATION AND

02:16:20.505 --> 02:16:22.741
I'M NOT OKAY WITH THAT. FEDERAL-

02:16:22.807 --> 02:16:25.944
AND I THINK. I THINK THE ANGLE

02:16:26.011 --> 02:16:27.078
IN WHICH WE SHOULD BE WORKING

02:16:27.145 --> 02:16:28.813
TOWARDS MORE EFFICIENTLY WOULD

02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:31.349
BE IN OUR IMMIGRATION REFORM

02:16:31.416 --> 02:16:33.752
THAT ALLOWS THESE KIDS- AS YOU

02:16:33.818 --> 02:16:35.854
THINK IT'S BECAUSE IT'S ANYONE A

02:16:35.921 --> 02:16:38.089
YOUNG ADULT AS WELL- WHO ARE IN

02:16:38.156 --> 02:16:39.891
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES TO BE ABLE

02:16:39.958 --> 02:16:41.259
TO BECOME CITIZENS AND THE

02:16:41.326 --> 02:16:44.095
REASON BEING I THINK IT'S

02:16:44.162 --> 02:16:48.133
IMPORTANT TO- TO- HAVE THAT USE

02:16:48.199 --> 02:16:49.734
IT. THERE'S A REASON WHY WE

02:16:49.801 --> 02:16:53.271
THERE'S CERTAIN- SPACES THAT WE-

02:16:53.338 --> 02:16:55.240
WE REQUIRE PEOPLE TO BE EIGHTEEN

02:16:55.307 --> 02:16:56.841
YEARS OLDER TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD

02:16:56.908 --> 02:16:58.743
U. S. ITIZENS AND SO FORTH. AND

02:16:58.810 --> 02:17:00.579
THAT'S BECAUSE WHEN YOU TAKE

02:17:00.645 --> 02:17:03.114
THAT OATH. TO BECOME A CITIZEN

02:17:03.181 --> 02:17:05.150
OF THIS COUNTRY. YOU'RE SWEARING

02:17:05.216 --> 02:17:06.785
ALLEGIANCE TO THIS COUNTRY AND

02:17:06.851 --> 02:17:08.787
WHAT IT STANDS FOR AND I'M NOT

02:17:08.853 --> 02:17:11.323
SAYING THAT MANY OF OUR OUR

02:17:11.389 --> 02:17:16.595
YOUNG UNDOCUMENTED- YOUNG ADULTS

02:17:16.661 --> 02:17:18.196
DID NOT CHOOSE IT WOULD NOT DO

02:17:18.263 --> 02:17:19.764
THAT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT IF

02:17:19.831 --> 02:17:21.199
THEY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO

02:17:21.266 --> 02:17:23.635
THAT THEY WOULD DO THAT IF THEY

02:17:23.702 --> 02:17:24.269
IF THE IMMIGRATION PROCESS ALLOW

02:17:24.336 --> 02:17:25.971
THEM TO DO THAT AND DEPENDING ON

02:17:26.037 --> 02:17:28.106
WHERE THEY ARE I'M I'M- YOU KNOW

02:17:28.173 --> 02:17:29.975
I. IT MAKES ME CONCERNED THE

02:17:30.041 --> 02:17:31.810
FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE A SYSTEM

02:17:31.876 --> 02:17:32.744
THAT ALLOWS HIM TO PURSUE THAT

02:17:32.811 --> 02:17:34.646
ABILITY TO DO THAT BECAUSE I

02:17:34.713 --> 02:17:36.681
THINK IF THEY HAD THE CHOICE TO

02:17:36.748 --> 02:17:37.816
DO THAT RIGHT NOW. THEY WOULD

02:17:37.882 --> 02:17:39.017
PROBABLY DO THAT. BUT WE ARE

02:17:39.084 --> 02:17:40.785
TALKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT.

02:17:40.852 --> 02:17:42.454
SOMEONE CHOOSES TO REMAIN A

02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:43.888
CITIZEN OF A DIFFERENT COUNTRY

02:17:43.955 --> 02:17:45.190
THE CHOICE. NOT BECAUSE THEY

02:17:45.256 --> 02:17:46.291
CAN'T BECOME CITIZENS THIS

02:17:46.358 --> 02:17:47.892
COUNTRY BUT I CHOICE TO BECOME A

02:17:47.959 --> 02:17:49.794
CITIZEN OF ANOTHER COUNTRY.

02:17:49.861 --> 02:17:51.630
PERSON BECOMING A U. S. CITIZEN.

02:17:51.696 --> 02:17:53.832
THEN IT MAKES ME QUESTION

02:17:53.898 --> 02:17:57.202
WHETHER OR NOT THEY THEIR HEART-

02:17:57.268 --> 02:18:01.873
TO PROTECTING- IN- YEAH I WAS

02:18:01.940 --> 02:18:03.708
LEADING HERE JUST BECAUSE-

02:18:03.775 --> 02:18:05.243
DEMONSTRATE A KNOWLEDGE AND

02:18:05.310 --> 02:18:07.112
UNDERSTANDING OF THE U. S.

02:18:07.178 --> 02:18:07.646
HISTORY IN GOVERNMENT AND

02:18:07.712 --> 02:18:10.482
DEMONSTRATE A LOYALTY. LOYALTY

02:18:10.548 --> 02:18:13.218
TO THE PRINCIPLES OF THE U. S.

02:18:13.284 --> 02:18:14.919
CONSTITUTION. ANDY WILLING TO

02:18:14.986 --> 02:18:19.157
TAKE THE OATH OF ALLEGIANCE. TO

02:18:19.224 --> 02:18:21.459
THIS COUNTRY AND THAT IS A

02:18:21.526 --> 02:18:23.295
CHOICE THAT THEY- THAT THEY MAKE

02:18:23.361 --> 02:18:24.829
WHEN THEY BECOME YOU ASSIST

02:18:24.896 --> 02:18:25.797
CITIZENS AND ONCE AGAIN I'M

02:18:25.864 --> 02:18:28.166
TALKING ABOUT- YOUNG ADULTS WHO

02:18:28.233 --> 02:18:30.368
CHOOSE TO IF THEY COULD BECAUSE

02:18:30.435 --> 02:18:31.202
THE IMMIGRATION POLICIES WOULD

02:18:31.269 --> 02:18:33.972
ALLOW THEM- I'M NOT SPEAKING TO

02:18:34.039 --> 02:18:35.640
THE TO THE TO THE FACT THAT MANY

02:18:35.707 --> 02:18:36.908
CAN'T OR HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO

02:18:36.975 --> 02:18:38.810
BUT TO THE FACT THAT THEY WOULD.

02:18:38.877 --> 02:18:40.779
SO MY ANGLE AND MY CONCERN WOULD

02:18:40.845 --> 02:18:42.847
BE THAT. WE NEED TO REFORM OUR

02:18:42.914 --> 02:18:44.315
IMMIGRATION POLICIES AND THAT'S

02:18:44.382 --> 02:18:45.850
I KNOW THAT'S A FEDERAL ISSUE

02:18:45.917 --> 02:18:47.786
NOT A STATE ISSUE BUT WE NEED TO

02:18:47.852 --> 02:18:51.222
WORK ON THAT END TO ALLOW THESE-

02:18:51.289 --> 02:18:54.092
THESE CADETS TO BE ABLE TO WORK

02:18:54.159 --> 02:18:58.396
YOU KNOW WITH. THE CHOICE TO. BE

02:18:58.463 --> 02:18:59.731
LOYAL TO THE FRIENDS OF THE US

02:18:59.798 --> 02:19:01.266
CONSTITUTION BE WILLING TO TAKE

02:19:01.332 --> 02:19:02.767
THE OATH OF ALLEGIANCE ON THAT

02:19:02.834 --> 02:19:05.403
END- BEFORE COMMITTING TO THAT

02:19:05.470 --> 02:19:06.738
BECAUSE I'M JUST KIND OF

02:19:06.805 --> 02:19:08.440
WONDERING WHETHER OR NOT. BY

02:19:08.506 --> 02:19:11.009
PLACING IN THIS POSITION IN

02:19:11.076 --> 02:19:13.111
MAKES THEM VULNERABLE. TO THE

02:19:13.178 --> 02:19:14.345
INFLUENCES OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF

02:19:14.412 --> 02:19:17.148
THIS COUNTRY. AND THAT TO ME- IS

02:19:17.215 --> 02:19:18.783
SOMEONE WHO ABSOLUTELY LOVES

02:19:18.850 --> 02:19:21.753
THIS COUNTRY. AND IS SO GRATEFUL

02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:23.755
BUT ALSO APPRECIATE AND LOVE THE

02:19:23.822 --> 02:19:26.191
HERITAGE WHICH I AM. BEEN FACED

02:19:26.257 --> 02:19:28.827
WITH IN WHO WHO MAKES ME WHO I

02:19:28.893 --> 02:19:34.099
AM. I THINK AS A STATE WE START

02:19:34.165 --> 02:19:35.633
. LAUNDERING JUST A TAD THERE'S

02:19:35.700 --> 02:19:37.669
A REASON WHY SO MANY PEOPLE

02:19:37.736 --> 02:19:39.704
AROUND THE WORLD COME TO THIS

02:19:39.771 --> 02:19:41.372
COUNTRY IS BECAUSE WE HAVE THE

02:19:41.439 --> 02:19:43.108
SAFETY AS WE HAVE LAWS AND

02:19:43.174 --> 02:19:44.976
REGULATIONS THAT KEEP US SAFE

02:19:45.043 --> 02:19:46.544
WE'RE NOT PERFECT BECAUSE OF

02:19:46.611 --> 02:19:48.079
HUMAN BEINGS MAKING WRONG

02:19:48.146 --> 02:19:49.180
CHOICES OF COURSE WE'RE NOT

02:19:49.247 --> 02:19:51.149
PERFECT BUT WE HAVE IDEALS AND

02:19:51.216 --> 02:19:53.952
PRINCIPLES AND LAWS THE HELP OUR

02:19:54.018 --> 02:19:56.354
COMMUNITY MEMBERS STAY SAFE. AND

02:19:56.421 --> 02:19:58.089
WHEN WE STARBRIGHT KEEN THOSE

02:19:58.156 --> 02:20:00.558
AND TRYING TO WORK AROUND THEN

02:20:00.625 --> 02:20:03.661
WE START. READING LOOPHOLES AND-

02:20:03.728 --> 02:20:05.764
THERE'S A WORD THAT I'M THINKING

02:20:05.830 --> 02:20:07.732
OF IN MY- THE MEETING BUT I THE

02:20:07.799 --> 02:20:09.768

MY TO MY THE FRONT OF MY- I

02:20:12.337 --> 02:20:14.606
THINK HERE. BUT I'M AFRAID I'M

02:20:14.672 --> 02:20:16.641
AFRAID. THAT WE START MESSING

02:20:16.708 --> 02:20:19.110
WITH OUR WITH OUR PRINCIPLES AND

02:20:19.177 --> 02:20:21.346
CREATING LEGAL LOOPHOLES. THAT

02:20:21.412 --> 02:20:22.814
NOT FOR THE GOOD HEARTED

02:20:22.881 --> 02:20:23.848
INTENDED PERSON BUT THE

02:20:23.915 --> 02:20:25.316
LOOPHOLES THAT IT LEAVES US

02:20:25.383 --> 02:20:27.585
VULNERABLE TO. TO THOSE WITH-

02:20:27.652 --> 02:20:31.823
NEFARIOUS HEARTS. AND MINDS. TO

THE VERY STATE AND COUNTRY THAT

02:20:34.025 --> 02:20:37.529
WE- THAT WE HAVE AT HAND AND SO-

02:20:37.595 --> 02:20:40.331

FEDERAL LEVEL WOULD TAKE ON THIS

02:20:52.076 --> 02:20:54.646
ISSUE AND HELP WITH IMMIGRATION

02:20:54.712 --> 02:20:57.615
POLICIES- WITH REFORM BUT IN

02:20:57.682 --> 02:21:00.485
THIS CASE AS FAR AS THE STATE

02:21:00.552 --> 02:21:01.853
GOES AND- AND NOT FOR THE GOOD

02:21:01.920 --> 02:21:04.489
HEARTED GOOD WILL- PEOPLE THAT

02:21:04.556 --> 02:21:06.224
WE HAVE BUT FOR THE NEFARIOUS

ACTORS THAT WE MAY HAVE. COMING

02:21:08.259 --> 02:21:10.161
IN AND USING THAT AS A LOOPHOLE

02:21:10.228 --> 02:21:12.130
TO- TO WORK WITHIN THEIR SYSTEM

02:21:12.197 --> 02:21:13.965
NOT THAT QUICK CREATES A GREAT

02:21:14.032 --> 02:21:17.335
CONCERN I DON'T WANT OUR SYSTEM

02:21:17.402 --> 02:21:20.405
OF LAWS HAD TO BE- HI. GOSH WHAT

ONLY WAY I CAN THINK OF RIGHT

02:21:28.880 --> 02:21:29.347
NOW IS COMPROMISED I THINK

02:21:29.414 --> 02:21:32.784
THERE'S- WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO

02:21:32.851 --> 02:21:36.321
ADVOCATE FOR POLICIES AND LAWS.

02:21:36.387 --> 02:21:38.323
THAT MAKE US WHO WE ARE AS A

02:21:38.389 --> 02:21:41.726

SUPPRESSING THOSE BUT I WANTED

02:21:50.702 --> 02:21:52.637
TO CLARIFY THIS DOES NOT ALLOW

02:21:52.704 --> 02:21:54.472
THOSE WERE LIVING IN THE SHADOWS

02:21:54.539 --> 02:21:56.641
TO BECOME A POLICE OFFICER. THIS

02:21:56.708 --> 02:21:59.744
BILL ONLY ALLOWS THOSE PEOPLE

02:21:59.811 --> 02:22:05.516
WHO ARE LIVING LEGALLY AND HAVE

02:22:05.583 --> 02:22:07.986
THE LEGAL ABILITY TO WORK HERE.

02:22:08.052 --> 02:22:10.388
SO THROUGH VISA GREEN CARD THAT

02:22:10.455 --> 02:22:12.423
PERMANENT RESIDENCY BUT THERE'S

02:22:12.490 --> 02:22:14.259
A VARIETY OF FORMS THERE'S A

02:22:14.325 --> 02:22:16.694
VARIETY OF MECHANISMS THAT GIVE

02:22:16.761 --> 02:22:19.864
YOU THE ABILITY TO HAVE THAT

02:22:27.739 --> 02:22:30.208
TRYING TO DO IT IS NOT OPENING

02:22:30.275 --> 02:22:32.744
THE PROFESSION TO ANYONE WHO

CHARGE OF NINETEEN DOLLARS OR

03:16:05.253 --> 03:16:06.921
FOURTEEN DOLLARS- AND I THINK

03:16:06.988 --> 03:16:07.856
