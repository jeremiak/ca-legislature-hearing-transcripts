GREAT TO BE HERE THIS AFTERNOON CONTRA PERCENT OF MY ON. BILL ON OUR RECOVERY RESIDENCES SB FOUR EIGHTY SIX. I IT DOES PRO KIBET COMMERCIALLY OPERATED RECOVERY RESIDENCES FROM ENGAGING IN PATIENT BROKERING. AND AS A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR PENALTY FOR ANY VIOLATION. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED SENATE BILL TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT ON SENATOR LARA. THAT PROHIBITS THE PRACTICE OF PATIENT BROKERING FOR LICENSED ALCOHOLISM OR DRUG ABUSE RECOVERY OR TREATMENT FACILITIES OWNERS AND OPERATORS OF AN R. T. OFF. IN ANY PERSON THAT WORKS IN A- RECOVERY TREATMENT FACILITY HOWEVER THIS BILL DID NOT APPLY TO RECOVERY RESIDENCES ANNOUNCE ALSO. HAS WE KNOW SOBER LIVING HOMES. SB FOUR EIGHTY SIX WILL SIMPLY ADD COMMERCIALLY OPERATED RECOVERY RESIDENCES TO THE LIST OF ENTITIES THAT CANNOT GIVE OR RECEIVE ANYTHING OF VALUE. THE REFERRAL OF AN INDIVIDUAL SEEKING ALCOHOLISM OR DRUG ABUSE RECOVERY AND TREATMENT SERVICES. GET OUT THE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR PENALTY FOR VIOLATIONS WELL AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT PROTECTS INDIVIDUALS AND RECOVERY RESIDENCES FOR REGULATION BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. IT COULD NOT. HAVE BEEN THE INTENT. THE PDA TO ALLOW FOR ASIA BROKERING TO OCCUR IN UPPER LIP HOMES. ARE THERE IS A PREDATORY PRACTICES LED TO MANY WE ARE VERY. FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE PEOPLE LINCOLN NUCLEAR ADDICTION AND KIRBY AS WE A AND THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED I NEIGHBORHOOD. ALSO THE PREDATOR PRACTICE TO REALLY NEEDS BOB AND I BELIEVE THIS IS ONE. AREA THAT HAS KIND OF FALL INTO THE CRACKS. AS YOUR CENTER MORE WHAT CAN I. DO IF THOSE ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. IN CREATING ENTERS AND REQUIREMENTS. NEED TO SOBER LIVING HOMES WELL THE DISCUSS. CONTINUE CAP. AND TAKE A STAND TODAY AND PREVENT INDIVIDUALS WITH ADDICTION FROM TREATED. INCOME PRODUCING COMMODITIES. THE BILL WILL MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE STANDARDS THAT WERE SET IN PLACE BY THE LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WILL ALSO APPLY. TO RECOVERY RESIDENCES THAT ARE COMMERCIALLY OPERATED. THANK YOU FOR ON YOUR ATTENTION TODAY AND WE DO HAVE SOME WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. OKAY THANK YOU BUT WITNESSES IN SUPPORT A YEAR MAYBE THEY HAVE A RIGHT OKAY. HE OF THE WHICH THE TESTIFYING COME BEFORE A TO ME TOO OKAY CONNIE CONNIE DELGADO ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. HI SHERRY DAVIS CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM OF ADDICTION PROGRAMS IN PROFESSIONALS WHO WERE IN IT WIENER POSITION- WE LOVE THE CONCEPT OF THE BILL WE JUST FEEL THAT THE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR A FIND SHOULD HAVE SOME LATITUDE TO IT SO THAT THE DEPARTMENT COULD ASSESS  PROPORTIONAL SANCTION AGAINST THIS ACTIVITY INSTEAD OF AN AUTOMATIC FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FIGURE OF FINE AND WE ALSO OBJECT TO THE USE OF THE WORD COMMERCIAL BECAUSE IT MIGHT CREATE ZONING PROBLEMS FOR A RECOVERY RESIDENCES BY CREATING A NEW DEFINITION THAT MAKES THEM SEEM MORE AS A BUSINESS IN AN OPERATION THAT A HOME. THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES SUPPORT SEE NINE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION HE WAS TO COME UP TO THE TABLE. AND WHILE THE WITNESSES COME AT THE TABLE I WOULD ASK THAT OTHER MEMBERS OF THE HEALTH COMMITTEE WE ARE ONE SHORT OF A QUORUM SO HE COULD MAKE YOUR WAY OVER HERE AT APPRECIATED. THANK YOU YES WITH THIS IN OPPOSITION DOCTORPAN- MEMBERS KERR CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA- WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY WITH THAT WE CERTAINLY- OPPOSE THE IDEA. OF PATIENT BROKERING IN THAT ODIOUS PRACTICES HAS IT'S BEEN USED AND PRACTICES AND PRACTICE- IN PARTICULARLY IN VARIOUS AREAS OF THE STATE SO WE APPRECIATE THE- MEMBERS- INTEREST IN ATTEMPTING TO DEAL WITH THAT UNFORTUNATELY WE THINK- ON- THE- ON. THE BILL- STEPPING INTO- THE RECOVERY HOMES REALLY TWO THINGS ARE- THAT WE THINK ARE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS- WITH THAT AND PARTICULARLY THAT THEY ARE COVERED BY THE- FHA. IN PARTICULAR AND SO THESE BECOME RESTRICTIONS AND REGULATIONS ON THESE- GROUP HOMES- ONE PIECE THAT WE FIND TO A PARTICULARLY TROUBLING ON THIS IS IN APPLIES TO- COMMERCIAL. RESIDENTS AS WELL AND THAT'S ANOTHER CLEAR AND APPLYING- BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SAYS THAT- HOUSING ACT APPLIES EQUALLY TO- COMMERCIAL RECAP HOMES AS WELL AS- THOSE THAT ARE NOT TOO WE JUROR. BUT ON THE. OKAY ABOVE TAKE THEIR OPPOSITION- TESTIMONIAL ICE TO SEE WE HAVE A- QUORUM SO SURGERY CAN YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. AM I HERE ENDS HERE GONZALEZ GONZALEZ HERE GROWTH. GROWTH HERE HER TADO. HURTADO HERE LEYVA LABOR HERE MITCHELL MONNING RUBIO. OKAY WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A QUORUM OKAY FOR THEIR TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION. AND FLOOR IN BEHALF OF WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN OPPOSITION. OKAY ARSINOE THEIR TESTIMONY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY IT'S BEEN MOVED BY CENTER GROVE OKAY- SURVEYS I DID I DO HAVE A DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS THAT- RELEASED THE QUESTION TO ASK YOU SO THE- AN ANALYSIS AND ALSO THE OPPOSITIONISTS TESTIFIED THERE'S A CONCERN ABOUT- THE FHA RULES ESSENTIALLY SAYING THAT I MEAN. A YOU TALK ABOUT A COMMERCIAL. OPERATED RECOVERY RESIDENTS- BUT ESSENTIALLY WHAT THE FHA SAYS IS THAT I MEAN THESE ARE NOT LICENSED FACILITIES- THESE ARE RESIDENCES RIGHT AND- SO OUR CURRENT LAW CURRENTLY ALLOWS FOR EXAMPLE IF A LICENSED TREATMENT FACILITY. IS MAKING PAYMENTS LET'S SAY TO A LANDLORD OR WHOEVER IS RUNNING SUCH A YELLOW- ZILLION IS MAKING PAYMENTS- THAT THAT IN WE CATCH THEM DOING THAT- AN ORDER OF EXCHANGE OF PATIENTS THEN THE FACILITY THAT'S CTION THAT FACILITY CAN LOSE OUR LICENSE AND BASICALLY BE EXCLUDED FROM BUSINESS RIGHT SELLERS THERE ISA MECHANISM TO. ADDRESS TO TRY TO PUNISH THOSE WHO ENGAGE IN THIS PATIENT BROKERING ON THE FLIP SIDE THOUGH IS THAT AND I KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE HOME SIDE BUT THE PROBLEM IS THE WAY THE FHA IS STRUCTURED. WE CAN'T. I MEAN IT'S A IT'S A LIVING SITUATION IT'S- IT AND SO WE CAN'T DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THAT- SO. SO WHAT'S YOUR I MEAN HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU SEE AS RESOLVING THAT ISSUE IN YOUR CURRENT BILL BECAUSE I THINK AT LEAST THE WAY I'VE SEEN IT IS THAT. THE DOES RUNNING CONFLICT WITH THE FHA. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION. SENATOR POUND ARE I THINK WHAT WE HAVE BEEN I THINK WE'VE ALL BEEN STRUGGLING WITH THAT WE KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN TWENTY YEARS OF FILE LEGISLATURA LAWS PROPOSED HERE TO TRY TO CURB WHAT SEEMS TO BE ON I'M JUST GOING TO SAY IT THE WAY I SEE IT I ABSOLUTE ABUSE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE RECOVERING FROM ONE SUBSTANCE ABUSE TO ANOTHER AW SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE WITH THE ONES THAT ARE CONSIDERED GROUP HOMES THEY THEY ARE THE ONES THAT DID MANAGE TO. SLIDE AMONGST ALL OF THE REGULATIONS BECAUSE A SOBER LIVING HOME CAN HAVE MORE THAN SIX PEOPLE I THINK THAT THAT WAS THE CONCERN ORIGINALLY PEOPLE THOUGHT- A SOBER LIVING HOME YOU CAN ONLY HAVE SIX ONE NO BECAUSE IT'S A GROUP HOME IS A GROUP OF PEOPLE WITH A PARTICULAR SUBSTANCE ABUSE THE COULD BE ALCOHOL DRUGS WHATEVER THAT COME TOGETHER TO LIVE TOGETHER AS A GROUP. SO WHAT'S MISSING CLEARLY IS TO HAVE THESE SET OFFFOR THOSE WHO ARE DISABLED AFFLICTED WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE COMPARED TO THOSE WHO ARE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED ALL WHO ARE DISABLED TO PHYSICALLY- LAWS LIKE OUR ELDERS SENIORS ALL OF THOSE OTHER- PROTECTED CLASSES IS QUITE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE ARENA. AND THE SOBER LIVING HOMES ARE BAD ACTORS LET'S SAY DISCOVERED THAT THEY CAN WEAVE THEIR WAY THROUGH THAT IS STILL GO OUT TO THE COMMUNITY AND BASICALLY RECRUIT ALL THOSE ARE LIVING ON THE STREET OBVIOUSLY ENGAGE AND THEN REFER THEM FOR A SOBER LIVING HOME- DIRECTLY TO A TREATMENT FACILITY. SO THERE'S ANOTHER CHAIN WE STOPPED AT THE R. T. OUT. FROM OB RECRUITING INTO THAT WE DID OT STOP AT THE OTHER END SO THEY'RE COMING IN THE OTHER WAY THEY'RE COMING INTO GROUP HOMES ALCOHOL AND ON A MISS WHATEVER. WILLING THEIR TO RECRUIT PEOPLE AND THEY'RE GOING INTO IT IS JUST. A RECOVERY RESIDENTS WHICH HAS NO- MANDATORY- RESTRICTION ON NUMBER IN THE HOME NO TREATMENT CAN BE GIVEN YET. THEY'RE COMING IN THAT WAY AND THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY. I THINK SOLVING THE PROBLEM THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE REASON THEY GATHER TOGETHER SO WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY. AND I DO THINK THAT THE- THE MEMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN OFFERED OF THE DISCUSSION OF COMMERCIALLY- RUN BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT WOULD AFFECT THE ZONING ISSUE THAT A LOCAL GOVERNMENT COULD RESTRICTED BECAUSE NOW IT'S COMMERCIAL. AND MAKE IT GO TO SOME OTHER PART OF THE CITY AND THEY WANT THESE HOMES TO BE IN A IN A NEIGHBORHOOD. SO PEOPLE ARE SURROUNDED WITH WHAT IS LACKEY HOME QUOTE UNQUOTE HI TO RECOVER AND BECOME PART OF. THE COMMUNITY AND CERTAINLY KICK THEIR HABIT WHATEVER IDEA SO I UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEMS BUT I DON'T THINK WE CAN CONTINUE TO KICK THE CAN DOWN THE- ROAD WHEN YOU NOW HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY BEING PRESENTED. ARE THAT THEY COME IN THE OTHER WAY BECAUSE WE SHUT OFF. YOU KNOW THE OF THE ROAD AND THREE THE RTO SPENT WE STILL HAVE THIS OPEN DOOR ON A SOBER LIVING HOME WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT BOB CERTAINLY I WOULD BE VERY PLEASED TO TAKE ON. THE MINNESOTA BEEN SUGGESTED BY THOSE WHO ARE. SUPPORT WITH AMENDMENTS I THINK THAT'S A START IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT T&lt;c.cyan&gt; LEAVE IT TO&lt;/c&gt; THE COMMITTEE TO DISCUSS AND- YOU KNOW. FIND A. PUT AWAY OR SEND ME OUT TO DO SOME MORE WORK. FIND IT BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS SINCE I WAS ELECTED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND I HAVE A FEW MORE YEARS TO KEEP AT IT. SO I WILL CERTAINLY BE DOING THAT. OKAY YES ARE NECESSARILY A- THANK YOU SENATOR BATES- I DO AGREE WITH YOU WE DON'T WANT ANYONE UP PUSHING SOMEONE INTO A FACILITY AND THEN RECEIVING MONEY FOR THAT OR ANYTHING OF VALUE- I DO HAVE A LITTLE ISSUE WITH A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE I JUST FEEL LIKE THAT IS WAY WAY WAY TOO MUCH I MEAN WE JUST HAD A BILL LAST YEAR WHERE. IF UNDER STAFFING RATIOS ARE MET WHERE PEOPLE ACTUALLY DIE- IT IN THE FIRST FIVE VIOLATIONS FIFTEEN THOUSAND THE NEXT FOUNDATION IS THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT FIFTY THOUSAND IS TERRIBLY HIGH MY OTHER QUESTION IS I DON'T BELIEVE THE SOBER LIVING HOMES ARE REGULATED BY. DH CS. OKAY BUT DH CS IS THE ONE WHO WOULD BE FINING THEM. THAT SEEMS THAT SEEMS A LITTLE THE THEY WOULD BE THE ENFORCEMENT OUR HOUSE THEY ARE FOR THE RTF OKAY THEY WOULD HAVE THAT ALL RESPONSIBILITY AT ALL OR WHEN SOMEONE ACTUALLY COMPLAINED SIR OUR- OFFENSE A COMPLAINT ABOUT ONE THAT'S OPERATING THAT WAY OKAY I WONDER IF THEY ARE THE BEST AGENCY TO BE THE ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES SINCE THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO CONTROL OVER THOSE HOMES. I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE A SUGGESTION FOR A BETTER ONE BUT- I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING- BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU KEEP WORKING ON IT BECAUSE I CAN'T SUPPORT IT LIKE IN ITS CURRENT FORM TODAY- BUT AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT OF THE-BILL AND MAYBE WE CAN KEEP MARK. WORKING ON AND FIGURE OUT A WAY FORWARD. QUESTION OKAY. AND AGAIN CENTER BATES I APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS ON THIS I KNOW THE YOU KNOW WITH HER. EARLIER IN THE STATE TIME SINCE THEN TO TODAY UNFORTUNATELY AND- NOT SHUTTERS SUFFICIENT PROGRESS A- YES AND I SUPPOSE THIS IN THE BEGINNING THAT THE CHALLENGE. IS I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY IS THAT WE CAN'T- BASICALLY SAY WELL THESE ARE SOBER LIVING HOMES AND THESE ARE. OTHER HOUSES RIGHT SO WHATEVER RULE WE APPLY HAS TO APPLY ACROSS ALL LIVING SITUATIONS THAT'S WHAT THE FHA SAYS AND I'M AFRAID THIS BILL I THINK THAT IS ALSO SOME ISSUES ABOUT LIKE THE AMOUNT I THINK THE FINES BUT EXCESSIVE AND SARAH. AT CURRENT LAW DOES ALLOW US TO GO SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE'S A RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITY WHICH IS LICENSED BY DTS. THEN WE FIND OUT THAT THEY ARE- MAKING OR ACCEPTING PAYMENTS. FROM OTHERS FOR PATIENT BROKERING. THAT'S THE ENTITY THAT IS ACTUALLY LICENSED AND CAN BE PUNISHED AND HAVE THE LICENSE THE REMOVED SO NUTS BECAUSE IT TAKES TWO TO TANGO RIGHT SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE- YET OF SOMEONE WHO'S SENDING THE MINES ON ACCEPTING THE MONEY SO- SO FORTUNATELY THAT IS EXISTING LAW I THINK THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ANY APPROACH ON THE HOME SIDE WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THINGS THAT APPLY EQUALLY TO. ALL HOUSES. OR POTENTIALLY BE YOU KNOW- IF THERE'S AN INDIVIDUAL BUT NOT AS A HOME RIGHT BECAUSE- AS MUCH AS WE MIGHT WANT TO STAY SOBER LIVING HOMES IN ANY TRIED TO COMMERCIAL BUT THEN IT PAYS REYES THAT DISTINCTION ABOUT WILL THAT BY DEFINITION WHAT'S COMMERCIAL RIGHT IF YOU'RE RENTING IT TO PEOPLE DOES THAT AUTOMATICALLY MAKE A COMMERCIAL- BUT I JUST RENTING TO SOMEONE WHO IS RE AIRING AT- DOES THAT AUTOMATICALLY MAKE YOU KNOW- AND HOW MANY OF THEM HAVE TO THE INTERNET SITUATION- SO. I DO THINK THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE THAT IS ON STONE RESOLVED IN THIS BILL IS IT'S- CONFLICT WITH SIR FEDERAL LAW AND ALSO CIVIL RIGHTS ABOUT SAYING THAT. AGAIN THESE ARE ON LICENSE FACILITIES SO THE PART OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN TAKE AWAY THEIR LICENSE- THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO THEY ARE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO THEY'RE NOT REGISTERED AND I KNOW PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT BUT AGAIN THESE ARE HOMES. THESE ARE NOT TREATED AS SOON AS THE TIP OVER INTO BEING A TREATMENT FACILITY. THEN THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES FOR THAT RATE AND WE CAN ACTUALLY GO AFTER SO IF SOMEONE IS. TREATING IS ENGAGING IN TREATMENT. WE CAN THEN- GO OVER TO THEM FOR BEING UNLICENSED AND PUNISH THEM FOR THAT IF THEY MAKE PAYMENTS TO IN ESSENCE FACILITY AND WE CAN GO AFTER THE LICENSE FACILITY ITSELF. TO SAY WHY ARE YOU ACCEPTING PAYMENTS YOU SHUT UP PATIENT PROGRAM SHOULD NOT BE ACCEPTING OR GRANT GIVING PAYMENTS TO PEOPLE. TO ANYBODY FOR PATIENTS RIGHT SO- SO WE DO HAVE THINGS IN PLACE MAYBE THERE'S THINGS WE CAN TWEAK ABOUT THAT ARE THINGS WE CAN DO TO HELP SUPPORT- TO PROVIDE MORE RESOURCES FOR ENFORCEMENT THAT WILL HOPEFULLY ET TO THAT- SO WE DO HAVE TOOLS TO DO THAT. MAYBE YOU CAN FEEL WAYS DANCE THOSE BUT I AM AFRAID THAT THE WAY THE BILL IS CURRENTLY IT'S STILL. AND FORTY RUNS OF ALL OF. WHEN HOUSING WILL SENSE FORTUNATE. NOT A SPORT. BECAUSE OF THAT BUT I DO HOPE THAT AND I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FOR WHILE WE CAN TO HAVE A DIALOGUE FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER MECHANISMS. WE CAN PUT IN PLACE- HOW DO WE MAKE OUR CURRENT MECHANISM EITHER MORE EFFECTIVE ARE THINGS WE CAN ADJUST THAT TO TRY JUST. THE VERY REAL PROBLEM THAT YOU SENIOR COMMUNITY GOT THE COMMITTEES TO SEE- ALL RIGHT. SO YES GROVE. I JUST WANNA PLEDGES FOR BRINGING THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION FORWARD AND I KNOW THAT IT WAS CREATIVE. FOR YOU TO GO AROUND THIS MECHANISM BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IN THE PAST- PREVIOUS YEARS LEGISLATION HAS. BROUGHT FOR TO THE LICENSOR. NEW SINCE IN EFFECT ON THESE ONES. AS DOCTOR AT THE CHAIRED MENTION. AND IT WAS DEFEATED IT STOPPED AND SO. I APPLAUD YOU FOR STILL TRYING TO ASSESS ISSUE IN MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE AREN'T. AND SHIVERS BARTER TREATED OR SOLD LIKE. SOME OF THE STUFF THAT'S GOING ON IN THESE PARTICULAR FACILITIES SO I THANK YOU FOR DOING AND LOOKING FOR NEW IN. WAITED. OUTSIDE THE BOX KING IN ORDER TO TRY TO SOLVE THE. IT'S CHARGING HILLOCK INDIA LICENSOR BUT AGAIN IT WAS KILLED LAST TIME BECAUSE IT BUDGET. THE STATE SAID THEY NEEDED WHAT TO ENTER NEW POSITIONS IN ORDER TO. EXECUTE THAT SO BUT I PLEDGE YOU FOR THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX. THANK YOU OKAY SIR YES CENTER GONZALEZ. YES I JUST TO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU AS WELL I KNOW THIS IS. BEING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT ONE BIG ISSUE CERTAINLY- BUT I TO YOU KNOW THINK THAT THIS NEEDS A LOT MORE WORK- ALSO WOULD BE INTERESTED IN FIGURING OUT HOW IF THERE IS A THRESHOLD HOW DO WE GET THOSE. LIVING FACILITIES TO BECOME A CERTIFIED IF THEY ARE AND THAT THAT BRINGS SO I DON'T KNOW MAYBE THIS IS A QUESTION FOR- THE COMMITTEE STAFF ON IF THERE'S BEEN ANY DATA BROUGHT BACK FROM SB. TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT FROM THE- R. T. ASKS TO SEE IF THERE'S- I DON'T KNOW ANY SORT OF DATA THAT COULD BE BROUGHT BACK- AND SIMILAR TO THE DISCUSSION WE HAD ON THE GRAVELY DISABLED- ISSUE I KNOW THAT THAT'S GOING THROUGH AN AUDIT CURRENTLY BUT PERHAPS THAT COULD BE ANOTHER AVENUE AS WELL TO FIGURE OUT. AND ALTHOUGH AND MAYBE THERE'S SOME SORT OF STATE CONNECTION THAT THEY HAVE OF SOME SORT OR YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO TO PROVIDE MORE DATA TO. HELP IN IN GETTING THESE FOLKS LICENSED. AND UP TO PAR SO JUST SOME IDEAS OUT THERE BUT THANK YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU. NO ONE ELSE OKAY. SO I TO WANNA THANK YOU I'LL JUST POINT OUT THAT. WHEN THE BIG CHALLENGES IS THAT. WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT SOBER LIVING HOMES AS THERE'S NO TREATMENTS IT'S SIMPLY PLACE WHERE THEY LIVE. AND I THINK WE JUST KIND OF THAT. THAT AND SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVEN'T THAT'S WHY WE WITH THE SEAT BELT LEGISLATION HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO PUT IN PLACE TO LICENSE THEM. OR NOT IT IS SOON AS THEY START DOING ANYTHING BEYOND PEOPLE LIVING THERE. AND THAT TIPS INTO A WHOLE DIFFERENT ATEGORY AND THEY ARE HAVE TO BE LICENSE AND SO FORTH BUT IT. IT'S JUST. BUT IT'S A GROUP OF PEOPLE LIVING TOGETHER WE CAN'T DISCRIMINATE AGAINST A GROUP OF PEOPLE LIVING TOGETHER AND ANOTHER GROUP OF PEOPLE LIVING. CHOOSING TO LIVE TOGETHER AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WERE. STILL WRESTLING WITH. BUT WITH THAT I ALSO DO WANT THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I JUST THANK YOU THE DISCUSSION I DO I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A PATH. THAT THEY'RE JUST. NOT READ. IT SO NO FLORIDA THE STATE OF FLORIDA HAS. A LOT OF WORK IN THE NOW DO YOU HAVE SOME OVERSIGHT ON WHAT'S DEFINED AS A- RECOVERY RESIDENTS UNLICENSED SO WE'LL KEEP WORKINGON IT. AND I THINK- MAYBE ON CERTAINLY AND THE NEXT A YEAR. HOPEFULLY WILL FIND AN ANSWER AND- I WILL CERTAINLY BE AUTHOR OR CO AUTHOR WHEN IT. EMERGES WHEN IT REVEALS ITSELF SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE DISCUSSION. APPRECIATE IT.
