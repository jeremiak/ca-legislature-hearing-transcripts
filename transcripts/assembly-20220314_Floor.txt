I URGE A NO VOTE. THANKS FONG MR MEDINA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. AS CHAIR OF HIGHER EDUCATION I THINK THAT'S AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE HAVE TO VOTE ON EMERGENCY LEGISLATION SO THAT STUDENTS CAN ATTEND ONE OF OUR CAMPUSES. THIS IS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE DESIGN THE MASTER PLAN ON HIGHER EDUCATION MISTER MISTER MEDINA IF I COULD ASK YOU TO WITH WITH OLDER COMMENTS I BELIEVE THAT IS IN REFERENCE TO THE UPCOMING. BUDGET ITEM. THANK YOU SIR. LOOKING FOR OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION ON THIS BUDGET ITEM. SECONDARY NINE. CLICK LIBERAL. MEMBERS WHO DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS OUT TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS OTHERS OUT OF THE. SB ONE EIGHTEEN AGAIN MISTER CHANG CLERK WILL READ SENATE BILL ONE EIGHTEEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON BUDGET AND FISCAL REVIEW AN ACT RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF MAKING AN APPROPRIATION THEREFORE TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY ABILITY TO THE BUDGET. MISTER CHENEY MAKE IT OPEN THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER S. B. I'M VERY HONORED TO RISE IN SUPPORT FOR THAT SB ONE EIGHTEEN SB ONE EIGHTEEN IS THE RESPONSE TO A COURT CASE THAT CAME DOWN IN THE FALL OF LAST YEAR COPYING STUDENT ENROLLMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY- THIS STUDENT ROLE MEANT. HAS BEEN GROWING OVER THE LAST NUMBER YEARS PARTLY AT THE DIRECTION OF THIS BODY THIS LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR. WE HAVE A TWO MILLION DEGREE SHORTFALL WERE TWO MEN TO BE SHORT IF WE CANNOT INCREASE ENROLLMENT INCREASED CAPACITY AT BERKELEY ALL THE OTHER UC'S AS WELL AS ALL THE CSU THAT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. SO AS A FOCUS OF THIS VERY BODY WE'VE BEEN PUSHING. ALL THE INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION I MEAN SURE THAT WE CAN KEEP COLLEGE AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE. FOR EVERY CALIFORNIA WHO WANTS IT. THIS WAS A MAJOR BLOW TO THE- THAT MOVE INTO THAT MISSION- WE HAD A ACTIVISTS JUDGE WHO HANDED DOWN A VERY DRACONIAN. A PROPOSAL. OKAY BURGER CO DECISION UNFORTUNATELY. WHEN THE APPEALS COURT DID NOT STATE THE DECISION. FIVE THOUSAND POTENTIAL ADMITS WHO WERE WAITING TO BE ADMITTED TO BERKELEY. WE'RE GONNA BE POTENTIALLY GIVEN REJECTION LETTERS OR AFTER DEFERRED TO THE SPRING OR ASKED TO TAKE THEIR COURSES ONLINE. IT AS SOMEBODY WHO CAN PERSONALLY ATTEST TO. HOW UC BERKELEY CAN CHANGE LIVES. I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE LET THAT HAPPEN THE STUDENTS SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PENALIZED FOR THE UNIVERSITY'S MISTAKES A COUPLE MISTAKES UNIVERSITY MADE. IN TERMS OF NOT ADEQUATELY PROJECTING ENROLLMENT IN THEIR LONG RANGE CAMPUS DEVELOPMENT PLAN. THEY ALSO MADE A MISTAKE OF NOT ASKING FOR A STAY WHEN THE EARLY DECISION CAME DOWN. I DON'T THINK FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS SHOULD REALLY PAY THE PRICE FOR A BAD YOUR CREDIT DECISIONS AND A VERY. POOR LAWYER WHO MADE A DISPOSITION ARE NOT REALLY DOING HIS OR HER JOB. AND SO TODAY WE ARE RISING TO DO A COUPLE THINGS ONE IS TO ENSURE THAT. WE TALK ABOUT ANY UNIVERSITY COLLEGE AS LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CAMPUS ENROLLMENT WILL TALK ABOUT CAMPUS POPULATION NOT TO STUDENT ENROLLMENT. CAMPUS POPULATION INCLUDES STUDENTS FACULTY AS WELL AS STAFF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE AT A PARTICULAR UNIVERSITY THAT DID NOT A DEFINITION IS VERY ACCURATE AND REFLECTIVE OF THE IMPACT OF THE INVOLVEMENT OF THAT PARTICULAR CITY AND WHAT'S GOING ON. ALSO WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE DRACONIAN JUDGE CAN'T JUST HAND DOWN A DECISION WITHOUT GIVING IT A UNIVERSITY OR COLLEGE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REMEDY IT. SO IF THE LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN IS SOMETHING TO PORT DOES NOT LIKE THAT WORK CAN ASK THE UNIVERSITY TO ADDRESS IT AND COME BACK IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND THEN AFTER THAT. COULD DO SOMETHING BUT ONLY INTEL ONLY ALLOWING THE ONLY TO THE ALLOW THE UNIVERSITY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR LONG RICH ABOUT THE PLAN THIS IS A VERY SURGICAL APPROACH TO THIS PARTICULAR DECISION. I DON'T THINK IT HAS LONG TERM ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT I THINK IT REALLY. ACCURATELY DESCRIBES WHAT A LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN SHOULD BE AS WELL AS LIMITING THE A SOLUTION TO COURT COULD PRESCRIBE WITHOUT I SUSPECT WE ASK. FOR YOUR VOTE ON SB ONE EIGHTEEN. THANK YOU MISTER THIS SPEAKER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS COLLEAGUES I RISE TODAY TO ADD MY VOICE OF SUPPORT FOR S. B. ONE ONE ONE EIGHT. WE SHOULD ALL AGREE ON THE NEED TO MAKE ROOM FOR MORE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AT OUR FINEST PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. I AM NOT AT ALL A SUPPORTER OF CREATING SEQUEL EXEMPTIONS I AM NOT A PROPONENT. OF GETTING ENACTED IS MADE CALIFORNIA A LEADER IN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS. AND ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION. WE ACT BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN RECENTLY THE MISGUIDED APPLICATION OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL LAW TO STUDENT ENROLLMENT. THE ACTUAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT IS NOT. FROM HOW MANY STUDENTS WE LEAD IN IT A RESULT IS THE RESULT OF THE TOTAL CAMPUS POPULATION. AND HOW THAT AFFECTS ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. WE MUST ACT TODAY IN A CAUTIOUS FASHION. TO MAKE SURE THE UNIVERSITY COULD ADMIT DESERVING APPLICANTS. THIS YEAR. THE UC ADMINISTRATION MUST ACT TODAY AND IN THE FUTURE THE PLAN APPROPRIATELY FOR THE IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CAMPUS POPULATION. UNIVERSITIES REMAIN COVERED BY SYKORA AND THEY SHOULD BE. FOR THE SAKE OF TODAY'S APPLICANTS WHO REPRESENT CALIFORNIA'S OUR FUTURE I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB ONE EIGHTY. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER MR FONG. I THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE BEST A PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS IN THE COUNTRY AND WE CANNOT LET A COSTLY LAWSUIT USING A LAW THAT IS IN DESPERATE NEED OF REFORM STIFEL THE EDUCATIONAL DREAMS ARE OUR BEST AND BRIGHTEST STUDENTS IN OUR STATE. WE A LEGISLATORS MUST CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THEIR THESE STUDENTS IN THEIR PURSUIT OF THEIR DREAMS THIS BILL CREATES THOUGH ANOTHER EXEMPTION FROM THE STATE'S EQUAL LAW TO ALLOW MORE STUDENTS TO ATTEND WORLD CLASS UNIVERSITIES IN CALIFORNIA. THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT CAN BE FOUND IN DIVISION THIRTEEN OF THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE THIS LAW REQUIRES ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORTS FOR A VARIETY OF PROJECTS INCLUDING CHANGES IN ENROLLMENT LEVEL LEVELS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION THIS BILL AMENDS THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE BY CARVING OUT CHANGES IN ROMAN LEVELS FROM ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT REQUIREMENTS. WE ARE MAKING NEEDED MODIFICATIONS TO SEE WHAT. AND WE SHOULD BE MODIFYING SYKORA FOR OTHER NECESSARY PROJECTS. WELL WE AREN'T CHANGING ACTUAL ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS WE ARE CHANGING WHAT THEY APPLY TO. THIS LAST MINUTE BILL HOWEVER HIGHLIGHTS THE FACT THAT SEQUEL IS DATED AND BROKEN. THE SEQUEL LAW WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY OVER A HALF A CENTURY AGO. OUR STATE WAS DIFFERENT OUR NEEDS WERE DIFFERENT OUR STATE IS NOW DEFINED BY CRISIS AFTER CRISIS FROM HOMELESSNESS TO ONE OF OUR PREVENTION. THE TRANSPORTATION A SUPPLY CHAIN INFRASTRUCTURE TO WATER STORAGE AND TO HOUSING. BUT OVER THE YEARS SEQUEL HAS BEEN ABUSED THROUGH LITIGATION. TO STOP PROJECTS THAT SERVE OUR COMMUNITY AND ADDRESS THESE CRISES. OFTENTIMES THE REASONS TO STOP THE PROJECTS. HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ENVIRONMENT BUT HAVE BEEN USED BY GROUPS WITH NARROW AGENDAS TO PURSUE FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS AS WE SEE RIGHT NOW. IN KERN COUNTY NEED HIGHWAY SAFETY PROJECTS HAVE BEEN DELAYED DRIVING UP COSTS AND EXPENSES A PRECIOUS TAX DOLLARS. NEEDED HOUSING PROJECTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA FROM THE TOP OF THE STATE TO THE BAY AREA. THROUGH THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND DOWN TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THESE PROJECTS BEEN HELD UP BY LAWSUITS USING SEQUEL. HOUSING THAT WOULD HELP EASE THE STATE'S HOUSING AND AFFORDABLE FOR ABILITY CRISIS. WE NOW SEE ANOTHER SEQUEL LAWSUIT AGAINST UC BERKELEY THAT HAS LED TO UNFORTUNATE REAL WORLD CONSEQUENCES IMPACTING THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE HIGHER EDUCATION. TO OUR STUDENTS. WELL THIS BILL AS NECESSARY IT FOLLOWS A LONG LINE OF SECRET CHANGES THAT ONLY HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR A BROAD BASED REFORM OF THIS AW. A GROWING CONSENSUS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR SEEK REFORM. BUT THE QUESTION REMAINS IS THERE THE POLITICAL WILL TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. WHERE WILL OUR STATE. CONTINUE TO BE PARALYZED BY CIVIL LAWSUITS THAT WILL PREVENT NEEDED IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES FROM TAKING PLACE. THIS BILL CORRECTS A CLEAR ABUSE OF SEQUEL AND I URGE YOUR SUPPORT TODAY OF SB ONE EIGHTEEN BUT MEMBERS WE ALL KNOW THAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. REFORM SEQUEL. THANK WHICH FONG MR MEDINA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS CHAIR OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND OUR SPEAKERS OF FOR THIS QUICK RESPONSE TO SUCH AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND THAT EXPLAIN WHY JUMPED UP TOO SOON TO SPEAK ON THIS MEASURE. WHAT IS CHAIR OF HIGHER EDUCATION I THINK THAT IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE HAVE TO VOTE ON THIS EMERGENCY LEGISLATION TODAY SO THAT STUDENTS CAN ATTEND ONE OF OUR CAMPUSES. THIS IS THE STATE THE DESIGN THE MASTER PLAN WHOSE PRESIDENT CLARK KERR DIRECTED THE TOP PUBLIC UNIVERSITY IN THE COUNTRY PERHAPS EVEN IN THE WORLD. ALTHOUGH I ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THIS BILL. I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT BLENDED STUDENTS BECOME PARIAHS OR EYESORES THEY WERE NO LONGER WELCOME IN OUR COMMUNITIES IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS WE HAVE FOLLOWED THE NEWS AROUND THE CITIZEN GROUP. IN THE CITY OF BERKELEY AND THE COURT RULING AGAINST THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. TO SAY THAT STUDENTS PRESENT AS WE HEARD THIS MORNING IS A THREAT EVEN AN ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT IS SIMPLY WRONG. HOWEVER THIS ISSUE IS NOT JUST ABOUT ONE CITY OR ONE CITIZEN GROUP OR EVEN ONE CAMPUS IS A GREATER PROBLEM. NOT JUST THE ANIMOSITY TOWARDS STUDENTS BUT THE BARRIERS TO PURSUING HIGHER EDUCATION. THIS TYPE OF REACTIONARY ATTITUDE STEMS FROM A DEEP IGNORANCE OF THE BENEFITS OF UNIVERSITIES. TO THE COMMUNITIES AND BECAUSE OF THAT I STAND IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE EIGHTEEN AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MR MEDINA. AND MR MCCARTY. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I ALSO WANT TO- SUPPORT THIS ITEM TODAY YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THE SWIFT ACTION THAT OUR LEGISLATURE TOOK IN RESPONSE TO THIS REVIEW REALLY DANGEROUS DECISION THIS WOULD HAVE SHUT THE DOORS OF COLLEGE EDUCATION FOR THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS AND WE KNOW AND I SAY THIS ALL TIME WE GO BACK HOME AND TALK TO OUR CONSTITUENTS ABOUT THE BUDGET WE DO SOME OF THE MOST% POPULAR THINGS THAT WE DO OUR TALKING ABOUT INCREASING ACCESS TO THE UNIVERSITY. WHY DOES IT MATTER AS OUR BUDGET CHAIR STATED WE NEED THIS FOR OUR ECONOMY OUR OUR ECONOMY REQUIRES MORE COLLEGE GRADUATES WE KNOW THAT COLLEGE IS THE TICKET TO THE MIDDLE CLASS SO WE STAND HERE TODAY WITH THE STRATEGIC FIX TO THE SEQUEL PROCESS SOMEONE TO REFORM THIS WHOLE BILL IN SEQUENCE SO FORTH AND GO ABOUT IT IN A SEPARATE WAY THIS IS MAKING SURE WE PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF OUR COLLEGE STUDENTS OUR STATE AND OUR UNIVERSITIES AND NOT LET- NIMBYS SHUT THE DOORS OF COLLEGE FOR THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WANT TO ADVANCE THEIR LIVES. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FOR CALIFORNIA AND MAKE SURE WE PROTECT NOT ONLY THIS UNIVERSITY BUT OTHER COLLEGE CAMPUSES ACROSS CALIFORNIA TO KEEP ENROLLING STUDENTS TODAY AND TOMORROW AND LASTLY WE DO KNOW THAT THE BIG ISSUE THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM SIGN UP HOUSING WE NEED MORE HOUSING ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND AT COLLEGE CAMPUSES- WE'RE DOING SO IN THIS BUDGET. THAT WE JUST PASSED IN JUNE WE'RE DOING SO IN NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET AS WELL AND I WILL NOTE THAT SOME OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SAYING WE SHOULDN'T GROW SO MUCH UNIVERSITIES YOU KNOW ALSO THE OPPOSED NEW HOUSING AT THE SAME UNIVERSITIES SO YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS SO THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE ACTION TODAY AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK OUR BUDGET CHAIR OUR SPEAKER AND ARE FRANKLY OUR STAFF IN THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE WE COMING UP WITH A SWIFT RESPONSE TO ALLOW THE STUDENTS TO ENROLL AND FULLY ENROLL STUDENTS AT UC BERKELEY. THIS FALL THANK YOU. THANK REST REGARDING MR MURATSUCHI YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

YOU KNOW TO WORK HARD TO GET INTO CAL BUT I WANT TO- MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T LOSE SIGHT OF THE BIGGER ISSUE WHICH IS THAT. YOU KNOW OUR UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS NOT TO JUST KEPT UP WITH THE CAPACITY. TO AND TO MEET THE DEMAND THE EVER INCREASING DEMAND ESPECIALLY TO GET INTO- IT THE MOST POPULAR- CAMPUSES LIKE LIKE BERKELEY. AND YOU KNOW I WANT TO. CONTINUE TO URGE. OUR BUDGET CHAIR AND ARE BUDGET SUB TO CHAIR AND ALL OF OUR EFFORTS TO CONTINUE TO PUSH ON WHAT I THINK SHOULD BE A NO BRAINER FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS WHICH IS THAT WE KEEP PUSHING. THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA TO ADMIT MORE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS- INTO- BERKELEY AND ALL OUR OTHER UC CAMPUSES- YOU KNOW EVEN AT THE EXPENSE OF CUTTING DOWN ON OUT OF STATE AND INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS. THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA LAST TIME I CHECKED IS STILL THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IT SHOULD BE SERVING FIRST AND FOREMOST CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AND I HOPE THEY WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH IN THAT EFFORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MURATSUCHI THREE OF US. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER THIS BILL IS CLEARLY PUTTING THE INTEREST OF STUDENTS FIRST. WE ALL KNOW ATTENDING UC BERKELEY CHANGES LIVES FOR MANY STUDENTS ESPECIALLY ARE FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS. AND I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SOUTH BAY. ARE THEY SHOULD BE CALIFORNIANS- THAT WE PRIORITIZE TO ADMIT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY. THANKS TO OUR BUDGET CHAIR AND OUR SPEAKER WERE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING TODAY TO MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE THAT WAS GOING TO BE ADMITTED. I WILL WILL GET A THE BAD IT MAIL PIECE- UNFORTUNATELY A REJECTION I SHOULD SAY. BUT AS OUR BUDGET CHAIR MENTIONED MISTAKES WERE MADE BY UC BERKELEY I AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY THAT'S WHY W'RE RUSHING THIS THROUGH. BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT AFFECTS STUDENTS BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE NOT GOING THROUGH THE FULL POLICY PROCESS AND PUBLIC REVIEW THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS SHOULD- I AM IN SUPPORT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT ANY STUDENT- TO MISS OUT ON THIS OPPORTUNITY. OF THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S PREMIER PUBLIC UNIVERSITY BUT IN THE FUTURE I HOPE THAT. OTHER UNIVERSITIES OTHER PROJECTS DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES- TO LEAD US AGAIN TO RUSH THROUGH THIS POLICY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS REQUEST AND MR GABRIEL YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TODAY TO JOIN THE COURSE IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE EIGHTEEN. THIS IS A BILL THAT IS. SOMEWHAT PERSONAL FOR ME HAVING BEEN BORN IN THE CITY OF BERKELEY THAT'S A CITY THAT'S VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART. AND ALSO BEING A PROUD GRADUATE OF UC BERKELEY I CAN SEE BOTH SIDES OF. THE ISSUE HERE BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT SOLUTION AND I WANT TO FIRST CONGRATULATE AND APPLAUD OUR BUDGET CHAIR IN OUR SPEAKER AND ALL THE LEADERSHIP. FOR THEIR SWIFT ACTION HERE I THINK THERE ARE THOSE WHO DOUBTED THAT THE LEGISLATOR SURE COULDN'T MOVE QUICKLY ENOUGH TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE ON SUCH A SHORT FUSE AND SO I WANT TO EXTEND. THANKS AND AN APPRECIATION FOR ALL OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE AT THE CENTER OF THIS CONVERSATION AND I THINK I'VE COME UP. WITH A REALLY IMPORTANT ANSWERED ALL THIS. ALSO HOPE THAT THIS THIS ACTION THAT WE ARE TAKING TODAY SENDS A MESSAGE NOT JUST TO THE BERKELEY COMMUNITY BUT TO COMMUNITIES AND INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION AROUND THE STATE THIS LEGISLATURE IS COMMITTED TO OPENING DOORS OF OPPORTUNITY. NOT CLOSING THEM AND WE WILL TAKE WHATEVER ACTION IS NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CROWN JEWELS OF OUR PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM THE INSTITUTIONS UP AND DOWN THE STATE THAT STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO ATTEND THOSE UNIVERSITIES TO RECEIVE A WORLD CLASS OPPORTUNITY. TO GO INTO MOVE THEIR FAMILIES INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS AND TO CONTRIBUTE SO MUCH TO OUR STATE AND I REALLY DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS TODAY IS ABOUT FIXING BERKELEY. BUT HE'S ALSO ABOUT SENDING A MESSAGE THAT THIS LEGISLATURE WILL DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DOORS OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND OPPORTUNITY REMAIN OPEN. AND ALSO WANT TO ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS OF OUR BUDGET SUB CHAIR FROM SACRAMENTO. THIS IS ALSO ABOUT HOUSING IN THIS IS ANOTHER REMINDER WHEREVER WE LOOK WE SEE OUR HOUSING CRISIS MANIFESTED ITSELF IN IT SO MANY ISSUES WHEN WE START TO LOOK AT THEM THEY SEEM TO BE ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. AND THEN AS WE PEEL BACK THE LAYERS WE UNDERSTAND THAT OUR HOUSING CRISIS IS AT THE ROOT OF THEM. SO WANT TO THANK THOSE WHO ARE INVOLVEDIN THIS WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE A BIPARTISAN STRONG VOTE IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE EIGHTEEN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS GABRIEL AND HIS WICKS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED AT YOUR DESK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I RISE AND OBVIOUS SUPPORT. OF THIS AND I WANT TO THANK OUR BUDGET SHARE. THE SPEAKER- OTHER FOLKS TO WORK ON THIS OUR GREAT SENATOR FROM BERKELEY WHO. SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON THIS AS WELL. I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS AND THINK IT'S AN OBVIOUS NECESSARY STEP. FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE FOR MISGUIDED NIMBYISM. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS LAWSUIT WAS ABOUT. THOSE ARE KIDS WHO OF MANY THEM SPEND OUR LIFE. TRYING TO GET INTO THIS UNIVERSE YOU ARE THE BEST UNIVERSITY UNIVERSITIES. IN THE WORLD. AND THE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD BE DENIED. BECAUSE OF NIMBYS WHO DON'T WANT TO. HAVE THEM IN OUR COMMUNITY AND MY COMMUNITY THE COMMUNITY I REPRESENT. IS APPALLING. AND THE SAME FOLKS THAT BROUGHT FORTH THIS LAWSUIT TO SUE THE UNIVERSITY FOR NOT PROVIDING ENOUGH HOUSING. ACTUALLY FIGHT. THE YOU SEE WHEN THEY WANT TO BUILD THAT HOUSING. SO LET'S NOT FORGET WHAT DROVE THIS LAWSUIT AND LET'S ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WE- AS A BODY ACT WHEN IT IS TIME FOR US TO VOTE FOR HOUSING PRODUCTION BILLS. WE GET THAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT RIGHT IN THIS BODY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROVIDE ENOUGH HOUSING. NOT JUST FOR STUDENTS BUT FOR WORKING CLASS FOLKS AND OUR NURSES AND ORDERLIES DOES AND OUR COPS AND OUR FIREFIGHTERS AND EVERYONE ELSE RIGHT NOW WHO IS TRAVELING FAR TOO LONG TO COMMUTE TO THEIR- JOBS WHO ARE.

MILLIONS OF IRISH PEOPLE FACE WAS SEVERE HARDSHIP. DUE TO FAMINE AND POVERTY IN THEIR NATION IMMIGRATED TO THE UNITED STATES OVER THE LAST SEVERAL CENTURIES IN SEARCH OF A MORE PROMISING FUTURE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE JOURNEY TO AMERICA WAS NOT PAVED WITH GOLD. LIKE MANY IMMIGRANTS THE AVERAGE SPIRIT OF DETERMINATION PERSEVERANCE AND GRIT PREVAILED AGAINST DANGEROUS SEASON DEADLY CONDITIONS WITH THEIR HEARTS SET ON THE HORIZON. OUR KIDS INITIALLY SUFFER PREJUDICE AND DISCRIMINATION UPON FIRST ARRIVING IN THE UNITED STATES AS THE YEARS WENT ON IRISH AMERICANS BECAME DEEPLY INTEGRATED IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND MADE NUMEROUS CONTRIBUTIONS AT ALL ASPECTS OF AMERICAN SOCIETY AND CULTURE- CAN TO BLADE VITAL ROLES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE U. S. NINE IRISH MERICANS WERE SIGNERS OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. AND TWENTY TWO PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN OF IRISH HERITAGE INCLUDING JOHN F.

THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION AS A AS A MEMBER OF THE IRISH LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS- AND AS A DESCENDANT OF ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE. WHO LEFT IRELAND DURING THE FAMINE AND CAME TO AMERICA- FOR OPPORTUNITY AND FREEDOM. AND PERHAPS YOU KNOW THE IRISH KNOW A LOT ABOUT THIS BECAUSE LIKE FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE IN OUR WORLD THEY EXPERIENCE DEPRESSION AND THE DEPRIVATION OF FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY. YEAH I WAS I WAS ABLE TO TRAVEL BACK TO IRELAND- HERE RECENTLY I LEARNED MORE OF THE HISTORY OF WHAT MY FAMILY UNDER. YOU KNOW THAT MY ANCESTOR OF HIS RELIGION WAS NOT ABLE TO OWN LAND- AND BECAUSE OF THAT. HE LEFT THAT COUNTRY INNS IN IN SEARCH OF THAT OPPORTUNITY AND TO GET AWAY FROM THE OPPRESSION THAT WITH THE WAS OCCURRING IN THE COUNTRY AT THAT TIME UNDER BRITISH RULE- AND WHAT HE FOUND HEARING CALIFORNIA ALTERNATELY ARRIVING HERE WITH HIS SEVEN CHILDREN. CHARLES GALLAGHER WAS OPPORTUNITY AND THE OPPORTUNITY FINALLY OWN THAT FIRST PIECE OF LAND- TO FARM AND TO PROVIDE FOR HIS FAMILY- AND THIS GREAT STATE AS IT HAS BEEN FOR SO MANY ACROSS THIS WORLD. GAVE HIM THAT OPPORTUNITY. AND THAT IS WHAT I THINK WE FIVE FOR EVERY DAY HERE IN CALIFORNIA THIS OF IN THIS VERY LEGISLATURE. BUT IN IRELAND. THEY FOUGHT FOR THEIR REPUBLIC AND THEY EARNED IT. AND THEY BROUGHT FRIEDMAN OPPORTUNITY AND NOW IN THAT GREAT COUNTRY THERE IS SO MUCH OF THAT. AND THEY HAVE FORGED GREAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR STATE. AND IT BECOME LEADERS AND SO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES. IN AGTECH IN PHARMACEUTICALS. WITH THAT FREEDOM THEY CONTINUE TO BE A BECOME A BEACON FOR THE WORLD IN FACT SPEAKING WITH MINISTER MCGRATH EARLIER BEFORE THIS SESSION THEY ARE OPEN UP THEIR DOORS TO REFUGEES FROM UKRAINE. ARE FROM THOSE VERY SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE FIGHTING RIGHT NOW. THEY KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS THEY'RE FIGHTING RIGHT NOW FOR THAT FREEDOM THAT SAME FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY.
