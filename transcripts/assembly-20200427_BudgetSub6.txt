THAT'S GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT THAT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS I HAD. MR OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR BEING HERE FOR THIS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT COMMITTEE HEARING- I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY POIGNANT FOR EVERYONE BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA BE EXAMINING NOT ONLY THE IMPACTS ON THE CLIFORNIA STATE ECONOMY OF THIS TERRIBLE CRISIS BUT ALSO THE IMPACTS ON OUR STATE REVENUES AND OUR STATE BUDGET FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR- AND I DON'T EXPECT THE NEWS WILL BE GOOD BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT. WE HAVE BEEN TELLING MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS BY IMPOSING A STATE OR MORTAR THAT THEY MUST MAKE DO WITH LESS AND SO MUST WE THIS NEXT BUDGET YEAR IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE SOME DIFFICULT DECISIONS THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT I AM HOPING TO TAKE AWAY FROM TODAY IS A SENSE OF WHERE WE ARE WITH RESPECT TO OUR STATE BUDGETARY RESERVES THROUGH AND NO SMALL PART THE DILIGENCE OF THIS COMMITTEE WE'VE SUCCEEDED IN. SOCKING AWAY NEARLY TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS OF BUDGET RESERVES AND MY QUESTION IS GOING TO BE HOW MUCH OF THOSE RESERVES ARE GOING TO NEED THIS YEAR HOW QUICKLY IS OUR STATE ECONOMY GOING TO REBOUND AND HOW MUCH OF THOSE STATE RESERVES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO SAY FOR FUTURE YEARS- IN THE EVENT THAT THIS LEADS TO A DEPRESSION SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR CONVENING THE HEARING MISTER CHARLIE OF MY TIME. THAT WAS FORCED BY STIR MISTER DOCTOR REGULAR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- I JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE MY WIFE'S SIDE WERE MASKED TODAY AND- I THINK SHE WOULD APPRECIATE THAT MANY OF US WERE TAKING APPROPRIATE PRECAUTIONS. BUT I DO WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR CONVENING SUB SIX AS WE WILL DISCUSS CRITICAL SUBJECTS DURING THIS UNPRECEDENTED TIME. I'LL GET RIGHT TO THE HEART OF THE TOPIC IF I CAN WHICH IS RECOVERY AND REBUILDING. AS THE CHAIR OF SUB ONE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES I FEEL THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADVOCATING FOR A STRONG HEALTH CARE SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM. AND OUR CORE SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROGRAMS. ALL OF WHICH ARE RESPONDING RIGHT NOW DURING OUR CO THAT NINETEEN DISEASE CRISIS AND OUR SEVERE UNEMPLOYMENT AND ECONOMIC RECESSION CRISES THAT ARE AFFECTING SO MANY CALIFORNIAN FAMILIES. OBSERVING AND APPROPRIATELY FORTIFYING OR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES IS AN ABSOLUTE IMPERATIVE IN OUR OVERALL STATE RESPONSE AND OUR CORE SAFETY NETS THAT WE DEVELOP. IF WE TAKE STEPS BACK IN HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WE ARE DEEPENING AND WIDENING THE SUFFERING. FOR OUR FAMILIES THAT WE ARE FACING RIGHT NOW. I'D LIKE TO MENTION A FEW AREAS OF I CAN MISTER CHAIR THAT WE MAY TAKE BUDGET ACTIONS ULTIMATELY TO SERVE THE PURPOSE OF A FAMILY FIRST RESPONSE RIGHT NOW. FIRST WE ARE LEARNING LESSONS THROUGH THIS CRISIS ABOUT HOW TO SUPPORT COMMUNITIES ON A VERY BASIC LEVEL ABOUT VERY BASIC NEEDS. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE CAREFULLY CONSIDER HOW WE FURTHER EXPAND AND EXTEND FLEXIBILITY IS AN OPEN UP ACCESS POINTS FOR HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES PROGRAMS FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO ASSIST CALIFORNIANS IN MEETING BASIC DAILY NEEDS. THIS COULD MEAN ADOPTING THE CONTENT OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND DEPARTMENTAL GUIDANCE INTO BUDGET TRAILER BILLS ON JUNE FIFTEENTH. WE STARTED THIS YEAR WITH A VERY STRONG PUSH TO COMBAT THE VERY DIFFICULT AND PAINFUL PLIGHT OF HOMELESSNESS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WITHOUT ACTIONS TO CONTINUE WHAT WE'VE DONE AS A STATE OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS AND IMPROVE UPON THEM WE MOVE IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. AND AGAINST A GENUINE FAMILY FIRST RECOVERY EFFORT. WE WANT TO KEEP PEOPLE HOUSED FED AND SUPPORTED THROUGH THIS CRISIS THIS IS OUR PRIORITY. SECOND MY VIEW IS THAT SUPPORTING VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND REBUILDING OUR ECONOMY ARE ONE AND THE SAME. FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE APPLY EMPLOYEES LOW WAGE WORKERS WE STIMULATE OUR ECONOMY WHEN WE ADD FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE TO BECOME C. N. A.'S IN NURSING HOMES WE REDUCE UNEMPLOYMENT WE STIMULATE OUR ECONOMY AND WE PROTECT PROTECT SENIORS ALL AT THE SAME TIME. WHEN WE PERMANENTLY INCREASE REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR TELEHEALTH WE REBUILD OUR HEALTH CARE WORK FORCE WE MAKE HEALTH CARE MORE ACCESSIBLE TO CALIFORNIANS AND WE STIMULATE OUR ECONOMY. WHEN WE PERMANENTLY EXPAND HEALTHCARE ACCESS FOR OLDER ADULTS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS WE PERMANENTLY IMPROVE THE HEALTH OUTCOMES OF OUR FAMILIES SO THEY DON'T FALL DESTITUTE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO SEE A DOCTOR. AND WHEN WE EXPAND CAL E. I. T. C. TO INCLUDE IMMIGRANTS TAX FILERS WE HELP OUR ENTIRE WORK FORCE. ALL THOSE WHO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR ECONOMIES RECEIVE TAX CREDITS. THAT THEY THEN PUT RIGHT BACK INTO OUR CON. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS. INVESTMENTS IN OUR SAFETY NET ESPECIALLY NOW OUR INVESTMENTS IN OUR ECONOMY. LASTLY I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT WE ARE RECEIVING SO MANY LETTERS OF CORRESPONDENCE RELATED TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES NEEDS WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY EACH DAY. AND I WANT THE PUBLIC TO KNOW THAT WE ARE RECEIVING THOSE LETTERS LISTENING TO YOUR STORIES AND CONSIDERING ALL OF YOUR PROPOSALS THAT YOUR THOUGHTFULLY PUTTING BEFORE US. THE UNDERPINNING OF ALL OF THESE IS A FAMILY FIRST APPROACH. WHICH I URGE US TO MAKE CENTRALTO OUR RECOVERY WORK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU DOCTOR REBEL ANYBODY ELSE WANT TO MAKE A- OPENING COMMENT. SO AGAIN I THINK OUR OUR VICE CHAIR PUT IT VERY VERY WELL THIS COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS IMPACTED ALL FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS USUALLY WITH THE PROTECT PARTICULAR DISASTER IT IMPACTS A VERY SELECT NUMBER OF PEOPLE SO WE HAD GET TO FOCUS- WE GET TO DIRECT RESOURCES ITH EVERY CALIFORNIA BEING IMPACTED BY THIS TO DISASTER A BIGGER PRESENTS A VERY VERY LARGE CHALLENGE WE NOW HAVE OVER TWENTY SIX AMERICANS TWENTY SIX MILLION AMERICANS WHO APPLIED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT IN OVER THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO APPLIED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT- WHILE WE UNDERSTAND EVERYBODY IS HURTING JUST THE STAFF OF. COMMENTS AND EMAILS WE'VE GOTTEN WE KNOW THAT THERE IS NO SECTOR OF THE STATE THAT HAS BEEN LEFT REALLY AREN'T TOUCHED BY THIS PANDEMIC TODAY WE HAVE A GREAT PANEL- WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO CAN GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS- DURING KOBE NINETEEN AS WELL AS AFTER A BIT ALSO TALK FROM THEIR INDIVIDUAL PERSPECTIVES ABOUT HOW THINGS ARE GOING WHETHER IT'S A SMALL BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE WHETHER IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL WORKER PERSPECTIVE- WHETHER IT'S- YOU KNOW JUST ONE PARTICULAR BUSINESS. WE ALSO HAVE- PRESENTATIONS FROM OUR LA- AS WELL AS FROM THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET POLICY CENTER SO THAT WE CAN REALLY. HAVE SOME. POTENTIAL BUDGET CENTERED IDEAS OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE ON LIKE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS THAT WE CANNOT DEFICIT SPENT- WE CANNOT BORROW- WE HAVE TO PASS A BALANCED BUDGET ON JUNE FIFTEENTH AND WE WILL PASS A BUDGET- BALANCED BUDGET ON JUNE FIFTEENTH. BUT THAT PRESENTS A CHALLENGE IN LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO DO ALL THE HELP THAT EVERYONE IS ASKING US TO DO. SO REALLY APPRECIATE AGAIN THE MEMBERS FOR COMING UP SACRAMENTO TODAY ND WE WILL START WITH- PROFESSOR NICHOLS BURKE WITH THE UCLA ANDERSON FORECAST. PROFESSOR. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO BE HERE THIS MORNING I THOUGHT IT WOULD BEGIN WAS JUST TAKING A FEW MINUTES TO GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF WHERE WE SEE THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY GOING AND NOT JUST TODAY AS WE MOVE THROUGH THIS THE RECESSION BUT- ALSO AS WE MOVE INTO THE FUTURE AND INTO THE RECOVERY. SO LET ME. LET ME JUST BEGIN BY SAYING FIRST OF ALL AS YOU ALL KNOW THIS IS NOT THE FIRST HAND DAMAGE IN HUMAN HISTORY A WE'VE BEEN HAVING PANDEMICS KIND OF ALL THROUGHOUT. IT IS THE FIRST. ENDEMIC IN OUR LIFETIME. AND IT IS THE FIRST ONE SINCE WE HAVE BEGUN TO COLLECT A RICH SET OF ECONOMIC DATA OR WHICH WITH WHICH TO ANALYZE. AB RECESSIONS. AND SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THIS IS A DIFFERENT RECESSION FROM ALL OF THOSE THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED IN THE POST WORLD WAR TWO ERA. ALL OF THE OTHER RECESSIONS WERE REDUCTION IN DEMAND BECAUSE- OVER BUILDING OF A BUILDING OF HOMES. HAVE COMPUTERS OF FENCE THE MILITARY L. AND- AUTOMOBILES AND SO ON. IN THIS CASE THE REDUCTION IN DEMAND IN OUR ECONOMY IS ONE THAT'S BEEN MANDATED BY THE IN EXTREME PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IN THAT MAKES THE TRAJECTORY OF THIS RECESSION A BIT DIFFERENT. IT ALSO MEANS THAT ALL THE FORECASTS THAT YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS RECESSION AND RECOVERY I BASED ON LESS DATA THAN FORECAST THAT FOR EXAMPLE- WE AND OTHERS PUT OUT IN TWO THOUSAND NINE DURING THAT RECESSION IN TWO THOUSAND ONE DURING THAT PROCESS IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE USED IN EACH AND EVERY FORECAST. SO ARE IS EXPLICITLY ARE. THAT BUT IN THE SUMMER IN THE EARLY PART OF THE SUMMER WILL BE ON THE BACK END OF THIS PANDEMIC CURB WILL BEGIN. THE OPENING UP OF THE ECONOMY WHICH WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE SUMMER. AND THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE DON'T HAVE A RETURN OF THE PANDEMIC. OR WE HAVE- WIDESPREAD VACCINATION AGAINST THAT. SO THOSE MAYBE HERO BECAUSE SOME SENSE BUT THEY ARE ASSUMPTIONS THEY'RE NOT A FORECAST. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE TOO OPTIMISTIC OUR ECONOMIC FORECAST IS TOO OPTIMISTIC SO THAT'S SOMETHING TO KEEP OUR EYES ON. SO WHAT DO WE SEE IS HAPPENING IN IN THE ECONOMY NOW WE LOOK AT THIS ON AN AGGREGATE BASIS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. N. S. SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT FOR THE US IS A 10% DECLINE IN GDP FROM PEAK TO TROUGH. NOW YOU'LL HEAR NUMBERS ABOUT 3035% DECLINE IN THE SECOND QUARTER THOSE ARE ANNUALIZED RATES. BUT THE ACTUAL DECLINE WILL BE ABOUT 10% MAYBE A LITTLE HIGHER. IMPORTANTLYTHE DECLINE IN. EMPLOYMENT WILL BE LARGER THAN THAT THE ALMOST TWELVE PERCENT. IN THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT THIS RECESSION IS SKEWED TOWARDS. THE SERVICE SECTOR IN SKEWED TOWARDS LOWER SKILLED LOWER WAGE THAT-COMMUNITIES. AND THAT MEANS THAT EMPLOYMENT THE CLIENTS ARE GOING TO BE GREATER THAN GDP DECLINE IN FOR CALIFORNIA WE'RE EXPECTING THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE TO GO UP TO ON A QUARTERLY AVERAGE BASIS TO GO UP TO ABOUT SIXTEEN ANDA HALF PERCENT NOW CLEARLY IT'S HARD RIGHT NOW BUT AS THE ECONOMY BEGINS TO OPEN UP SOME OF THOSE WHO ARE CURRENTLY FURLOUGHED WILL BE HIRED BACK. BUT IMPORTANTLY. FIRMS IN RECESSIONS IN THIS IS ONE PLACE WHERE WE CAN TAKE THE DATA FROM THE PAST FIRMS IN RECESSIONS TRY TO MAKE IT TO THE OTHER SIDE TO WIN DEMAND STARTS GROWING TO GET IN SOME OF THEM DON'T MAKE IT IN SO OUR EXPECTATION IS. THAT THE- AS THE RESTRICTIONS ON FIRMS OPENING ARTISTE N. FIRMS DO OPEN AND HIGHER BACK FOR LET HIM PLEASE. THE NUMBER THOSE FIRMS AND NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THEY'RE GOING TO GO INTO BANKRUPTCY AND THEY'RE GONNA LAY OFF THOSE EMPLOYEES. AND SO WE SEE A FURTHER CONTRACTION INTO THE THIRD QUARTER OF THIS YEAR. AND IN THE- UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WILL PEAK OF SIXTY ABOUT SIXTEEN AND A HALF PERCENT. AT THE END OF THE AT THE END OF THE YEAR IN THE FOURTH QUARTER BECAUSE UNEMPLOYMENT TYPICALLY KEEPS GOING UP. EVEN AFTER RECESSION IS OVER WITH. AND THEN WE'LL BEGIN RECOVERY AND THE RECOVERY. THAT WE THINK IS GOING TO BE MORE RAPID AND- THE IN THE LAST RECESSION JUST BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE WAY IN WHICH DEMAND HAS BEEN RESTRICTED. BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AN EXTRAORDINARILY RAPID RECOVERY THERE TAKE ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THE RETURN TO TWENTY NINETEEN EMPLOYMENT LEVELS. SO THIS IS GOING TO BE A AS SOMEONE DIFFICULT. TIME ZEROING IN. ON WHAT SECTOR ARE MOST. AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE RETAIL WHICH WE DO NOT EXPECT TO FULLY RECOVER BECAUSE RETAIL WAS CONTRACTING. EVEN IN THE EXPANDING ECONOMY IN THIS BRICK AND MORTAR RETAIL. A CITIZEN ACCESS THE THEY'LL BE A AN ACCESS NUMBER OF. THE OTHER STAB WAS WAS THERE AND- RETAIL WORKERS YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND REEMPLOYMENT IN THE SAME INDUSTRY. LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY WHICH INCLUDES TOURISM AND TOURISM IS A SECTOR THAT IS GOING TO BE HERE FOR QUITE A WHILE- BUT OTHER ASPECTS OF LEADER OF HOSPITALITY WE EXPECT TO RECOVER IN THE NEXT EIGHTEEN MONTHS. AND OF OR RATHER THE EIGHTEEN MONTHS THAT THE BEGINS THE BEGINNING A TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN OTHER SERVICES. WHICH INCLUDES PERSONAL SERVICES THAT SHOULD- AT RISK THE COVER QUITE RAPIDLY IN AND FINALLY CONSTRUCTION. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE EXPECT AND THEN WE GET FROM THE DATA WHAT PASSED FOR SESSIONS IS A SAVINGS RATES ARE GOING UP. AND THAT MEANS THAT CONSUMPTION IS GOING DOWN. THE HOUSEHOLDS WOOD FRAME REBUILD THEIR BALANCE SHEETS AND THEY'LL TRY AND SAVE MORE BECAUSE THEY ARE UNCERTAIN ABOUT TWENTY TWENTY ONE. BUSINESSES WILL DO THE SAME AND NOT INVEST AS MUCH. IN IN THAT LEADS TO A SLOWER RECOVERY. THE SO IS THERE ANY GOOD NEWS IN THIS WELL. SOME SORT OF. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THIS WILL BE A MORE RAPID RECOVERY THAT WE SAW IN THE TWENTY TWO THOUSAND EIGHT- 200-082-0009 RECESSION. THE FIRST AND SECOND THE RECOVERY IS GOING TO. BE SKEWED TOWARDS TECHNOLOGY AND- YOU KNOW AS THE WORLD RETREAT FROM GLOBALIZATION AS SUPPLY CHAINS ARE BROUGHT BACK INTO THE US THAT'S GOING TO DEMAND. TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS THE MORE REMOTE WORKING DEMANDS TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS THESE THAT THINGS A CALIFORNIA DOES WELL. AND THESE TEND TO BE HIGH WAGE SECTORS THEY ALSO TEND TO BE SECTORS THAT. DISPROPORTIONATELY CONTRIBUTE TO STATE REVENUES SO THAT MEANS THAT. IN THE RECOVERY CALIFORNIA IN THOSE SECTORS IS WELL POSITIONED BUT IT IS NOT WELL POSITIONED IN RETAIL LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY AND LOGISTICS IN SO OUR WORRIES JUST TO CONCLUDE BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT YOU ALL WANT TO GET THE QUESTIONS IN THE OTHER PANELISTS. ARE EVER TURN OF THE PANDEMIC IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE SOMETHING A YOU KNOW FOLLOWING A KNOCK ON IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR BECAUSE IS A LOT OF. LIQUIDITY CHASING YIELD RIGHT NOW. AND THE WAY IN WHICH THE WORLD ECONOMY DE COUPLES IN IN PARTICULAR HOW THAT AFFECTS OUR PORTS IN THE JOYSTICKS. SO LET ME STOP THERE AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO BE NEXT WE HAVE- RODNEY PHONE TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SAN FRANCISCO CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. RODNEY. THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TODAY ALL MY NAME'S RODNEY FONG CEO OF THE SAN FRANCISCO CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OR 80% OF OUR MEMBERS ARE SMALL BUSINESSES. AND I WANT TO TRY TO SPEND MY TIME HERE NOT TELLING YOU ABOUT THE- DIFFICULTIES LOW'S ON THE GROUND THE GIVE YOU POSSIBLY SOME SOLUTIONS ARE SOME IDEAS. ON WHAT WE CAN WORK FROM. HOME CLEARLY THIS IS A DIFFICULT TIME ALL EVERYONE I TRY TO WORK TOGETHER TO TRY TO COME UP WITH NEW SOLUTIONS. IT'S NEVER BEEN MORE CURRENT NOW I THINK THE CALIFORNIA TO SHOWING THAT SMALL BUSINESSES THE BACKBONE CALIFORNIA. REALLY SEEING I THINK A DEMONSTRATION OF HOW FRAGILE BUSINESSES ARE SMALL MEDIUM AND LARGE. SEE HOW QUICKLY THEY THEY COLLAPSE QUITE FRANKLY. I'M GOING TO MENTION SOMETHING THAT PROBABLY DOESN'T FALL INTO THE ECONOMIC PEACE BUT AT THE CHAMBER WE REALLY FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT. AND THAT IS THE IMPORTANCE AND THE SPEED IN WHICH OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS REGAINING THE CONFIDENCE TO. RECAP IS BACK UP. 32% OF OUR WORKFORCE OUR PARENTS. AND OUR WORKING PARENTS. JACKSON HEARD AND THAT WE GET OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS BACK ONLINE. BECAUSE CONFIDENCE IN THE PARENTS TO CERTAIN KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL. AND IT GOES PARENTS CAN FEEL COMFORTABLE GETTING BACK TO WORK. AS YOU ARE SPEAKERS SPOKE I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE. REMOTE WORKING BECOME A HUGE PLAY. IN A CALIFORNIA'S GROWTH THROUGH TECHNOLOGY BUT THAT OTHER SOURCES. DON'T BE SURPRISED IF YOU SEE PEOPLE WORKING FROM HOME TWO THREE DAYS A WEEK. GOING INTO AN OFFICE FOR IN PERSON MEETINGS ABOUT A TWO THREE DAYS A WEEK. THAT SHEDS IMPORTANCE ON THE OTHER PIECE OF INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS INCREASED BROADBAND SERVICE. IN INTERNET SERVICE EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA. AN EQUITABLE LEVEL. SECOND YOU SO TO MENTION IS. SORT OF THE BALL. TO YOU KNOW THERE'S GONNA BE A NEED FOR SPEED TO GET. THE SPEED OF BUSINESS ISTO GET BACK OPEN WHEN IT'S SAFE AND WE GET THE ALL CLEAR TO DO THAT. I'M WAITING FOR THE STATE TO COME UP WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS ABOUT HOW WE INTERACT IN BUSINESSESHOW WE INTERACT IN RESTAURANTS. MAYBE TO SLOW ON HONESTLY. I THINK WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT A LONG WINTER HERE- CERTIFIED HEALTHY PLACE. STANDARD OR BUSINESSES CAN TAKE THEIR BEST PRACTICE INSURE THEM. ONE TWO YEAR POTENTIALLY AGREE TO SOME NEW STANDARDIZATION. ONE IN PARTICULAR BRICK AND MORTAR BUSINESS SEEMS LIKE RESTAURANTS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY SURVIVE WITH SPREADING OUT. AND HAVING FEWER SEATS. IN SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR RESTAURANTS EVEN WITH A FULL HOUSE TO BREAK EVEN. YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY REINVENT GENERATED THAT. ADAPT. THEMSELVES YES IT IS. ABOUT ADDING TO. AS MEMORIES REST ARE GONNA HAVE DO SO OTHER SIT IN RESTAURANTS OUT ALL IS GOOD TO BE A BIG. TRAPS HAVING REACHED INSIDE RUSTON AND SO ESSENTIAL. I'M GOOD JUST GO TO BE CRITICS. WE NEED TO ADAPT SMALL. ME BEGIN I NEED TO BEGIN THINKING ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE THEY LEAD INTO TO A SINGLE STORE. WILL WE BE APPOINTMENT ONLY FOR A BOUTIQUE BUSINESS. BENEFACTORS WANT TO EXAMINE HOW THEY SHIFT THEIR SCHEDULES MAYBE BECOMING TWENTY FOUR OUR WORKSTATIONS STARTING OUT GETTING A LONGER SHIPS SHORTER SHIPS. NOT QUITE SURE WHAT TO BE ABLE TO. CREATE TOGETHER IN THAT IT OPENED A BARN. AND IT IS JUST IMPORTANT FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS IN CALIFORNIA TO DO THEIR BEST TO GET THEIR GUIDELINES WE GET RESOURCE IN CERTAIN GET BACK IN BUSINESS EVEN STARTING NOW BEGINNING TO THINK ABOUT AND LETTING OUR ENTREPRENEURS REALLY BEGIN TO THINK BOUT HOW WHEN THEY GET THE GREEN LIGHT. ARE THEY GOING TO CHANGE AND THAT THEIR BUSINESS IS FURTHER AHEAD WE CAN GET BY THOSE RESOURCES FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH STANDARD VOLUNTARY OR BY LAW. IT WOULD BE GREAT SO I KNOW WE CAN DO IT ON THE LAST THING I WANT A CURRENT OR ZONE IS TO TRACK THE TECHNOLOGY OF. CONTACT TRACING TECHNO. WE SEE IN OTHER CITIES AROUND THE WORLD WHERE MAYBE THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT AHEAD OF US. THEY'RE USING THEIR PHONES TRACK WITH AROUND AND IT'S COMPLETELY PRIVATE. THEY THEY'RE THEY'RE FINDING OUT ON THEIR EXPOSURE RATE. AND A LOT OF THAT DEPENDS ON THE VOLUNTEER EFFORTS OF INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES TO SHARE THAT. SO AND THAT IS THE END OF MY CONCEPT IS TO GROW TO QUESTIONS OR YOU CAN EMAIL ME. AT OUR PHONE AS EXCERPTED RAKAN. I KNOW THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IS A GREAT POSITION. I OPPORTUNITY REESE. AND AGAIN FOCUS ON PUBLIC SCHOOLS PUBLIC HEALTH AND THAT WILL HELP OUR SMALL BUSINESS GET BACK ONLINE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU RODNEY. NEXT WE'RE HONORED TO HAVE A DAVID- ILHAM FROM HILMAR CHEESE COMPANY. YES GOOD MORNING HAND GERMAN CHANGE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE- THIS MORNING MY NAME IS DAVID ALL AMONG THE CEO HILMAR CHEESE COMPANY. LOCATED IN HELL MARK CALIFORNIA. BUT SHE'S COMPANY WAS FOUNDED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR BY TWELVE FORMER FAMILIES AND CONTINUES TO BE HELD BY THE SAME GEHRY FARMERS TODAY. WE PRODUCE NATURAL AMERICAN CHEESE. STYLE SUCH AS CHEDDAR MONTEREY JACK COLBY FOR RETAIL AND FOOD SERVICE CUSTOMERS AND OUR HALLMARK GREETING ITS DIVISION MANUFACTURES. OUT WAY PROTEIN AND LACTOSE FOR USE AN INFANT FORMULA PROTEIN BARS AND BEVERAGES. TO MANUFACTURING SITES ONE IN A MORE CALIFORNIA SECOND IN DALHART TEXAS. OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND AROUND THE GLOBE WE ARE SUPPLIED BY. ABOUT TWO HUNDRED INDEPENDENT DAIRY FARM FAMILIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I WAS ASKED TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT OUR EXPERIENCE IN OPERATING IN THIS CHALLENGING TIME. TODAY IN THIS PROGRAM NINETEEN ENVIRONMENT WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME AND A LOT OF EFFORT ENSURING WE CAN EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS IN A SAFE WAY OUR ACTIVITY IS CENTERED. AROUND KEEPING PEOPLE HEALTHY WHILE AT THE SAME TIME CARRYING OUT OUR SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY OF PRODUCING FOOD TO FEED CALIFORNIANS AND THE WORLD. WE MUST CONTINUE THIS CRITICAL WORK AGRICULTURE AND FOOD PRODUCTION IS THE BACKBONE OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY THIS CRISIS REMINDS US ALL THAT WHAT WE DO IN AGRICULTURE IS ESSENTIAL. EMPTY SHELVES AT THE GROCERY STORE HAVE PUNCTUATED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FOOD SUPPLY AND A GREAT ASSET IT IS TO CALIFORNIA. WE ARE PART OF AN EXTENSIVE SO I CHAINED INVOLVING GEHRY FARMERS PROCESSORS ACTED CHEN CONVERTERS RETAILERS AND FOOD SERVICE OPERATORS THIS TERRY SO I CHIANG AND CALIFORNIA'S SUPPORT OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DIRECT AND INDIRECT JOBS. EACH OF THESE STAKEHOLDERS HAS BEEN IMPACTED DIFFERENT WAYS JERRY FARMERS AND OUR OWNERS HAVE BEEN HIT HARD AS THEY SEE THEIR INCOME FALL WELL BELOW THE COST OF PRODUCTION. OUR RETAIL CUSTOMERS BUSINESSES UP OVERALL ARE RIDDLED WITH VOLATILITY AND THE CHALLENGES OF OPERATING IN THIS ENVIRONMENT. FOOD SERVICE DEMAND HAS FALLEN OFF A CLIFF AND THE VALUE OF THE CHEESE WE SELL HAS DROPPED OVER 40% IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. IN THE END EVERY LINK IN THE CHAIN WILL SUFFER. WE EXPECT THE RECOVERYTO BE SLOW AND ELONGATED AS THE AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THE SHELTER IN PLACE TO LAST WELL INTO THE FUTURE. WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE WHAT ARE THE PRIORITIES I THINK THERE ARE TWO KEYS TO MOVING FORWARD IS. RESTORING CONFIDENCE AND SUPPORTING ECONOMIC GROWTH. FIRST WE MUST RESTORE CONFIDENCE. WE ALL WANT TO RETURN TO WHAT WE DID BEFORE WE NEED TO FIND NEW AND SEE SAFE WAYS TO DO SO. THE MORE WE CAN AGGRESSIVELY SUPPORT ANSWER ABOUT INCENTIVIZE AND ADOPT NEW SAFE WAYS THAT ALLOW US TO EAT OUT SHOP GO TO SCHOOL AND GO TO THE MOVIES AGAIN. THE QUICKER WE GET BACK ON TRACK. THIS ACTIVITY DRIVES DEMAND AND DEMAND GETS PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. SECOND SUPPORT AND DO NOT HINDER ECONOMIC GROWTH IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE DO NOT INHIBIT THE RECOVERY. WE MUST USE OUR ABILITIES TO STIMULATE SO I SEE IT OUR ECONOMY IS LIKE A FLEET OF SHIPS. SOME SHIPS HAVE CERTAINLY S THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA RIGHT NOW AND THE REMAINING ARE PARTIALLY SUBMERGED NOW'S NOT THE TIME TO THROW ON MORE WAIT TIME TO SURVIVING SHIPS. IT'S TIME TO REDUCE WEIGHT AND INCREASED BUOYANCY FOR THE BENEFIT OF EVERYONE. AT HELL MARCHES COMPANY ARE RALLYING CRY THE PAST FEW MONTHS HAS BEEN TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT LIVES AND LIVELIHOODS. I ENCOURAGE STATE TO TAKE UP THE SAME CHALLENGE FIND A WAY% TO DO BOTH AT THE SAME TIME SAVING LIVES AND LIVELIHOODS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS WITH EQUAL ENTHUSIASM. WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER AND WE ALL WANT TO LOOK BACK IN THE FUTURE ON THESE TOUGH TIMES. THESE TOUGH DAYS WITH PRIDE IN KNOWLEDGE THAT WE DID OUR BEST THANKS AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY I TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK OUR EMPLOYEES AND OUR DAIRY PRODUCERS. WILL ALL DONE AN EXTRAORDINARY JOB OF CARRYING OUT THEIR SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY TO REDUCE FOOD FOR THE WORLD. DURING A TIME OF GREAT UNCERTAINTY WITHOUT THEIR INGENUITY DEDICATION AND HARD WORK OUR SHIP COULD NOT FLOAT AND WE COULD NOT KEEP PEOPLE FED AT THIS TIME. THANKS AND- ONE. THANK YOU MISTER SHADE SO NEXT WE'RE GOING TO GO TO- SARRUD CHINA RAHMAN WITH ONE FAIR WAGE. HEY AT THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME MY NAME IS SERGEANT I'M AND I'M A PROFESSOR AT THE UC BERKELEY COLEMAN SCHOOL OF PUBLIC POLICY AND I LEAD A NATIONAL EFFORT OF SERVICE RECORDS CALLED WHEN YOUR WAGE. I'M AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING THAT MILLIONS OF LOW WAGE WORKERS THAT HAVE BEEN LAID OFF OR ARE FACING EVER USED HOURS OR DIFFICULT SITUATIONS RIGHT NOW OF COURSE MY EXPERTISE IS LARGELY IN THE SERVICE SECTOR BUT I'D WANNA LEFT UP THAT IT IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING FOR LOW WAGE WORKERS. ACROSS THE BOARD SO OF THE MILLIONS OF WORKERS THAT HAVE BEEN LAID OFF ABOUT ONE POINT ONE MILLION RESTAURANT WORKERS IN PARTICULAR HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS AND MANY ARE TELLING US THAT THEY ARE HAVING A LOT OF DIFFICULTY ACCESSING BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE OF COURSE FOR UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS WHO MAKE UP A VERY LARGE PERCENTAGE. OF THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA I'M THAT IS OF GREAT CONCERN AND WHILE IT'S MUCH APPRECIATED THAT CALIFORNIA'S DOING MORE THAN OTHER STATES RUN DOCUMENTED WORKERS IT CERTAINLY IS NOT ENOUGH FOR PEOPLE FACING A RENT- ISSUES OF ADDICTION- AND JUST BASICALLY TRYING TO FEED THEIR FAMILIES. I'M THIS ALSO IS A PROBLEM FOR CALIFORNIA WHEN LOW WAGE WORKERS I. DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO INCOME DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE A CREASE COSTS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT CREATES A LACK OF CONSUMPTION EVEN AS WE RE OPEN. I IT WILL BE A SLOW RECOVERY FOR THE SERVICE SECTOR- AND LOW WAGE WORKERS WILL FACE MANY DEATHS. AND IT WILL BE A SERIOUS SITUATION WHICH THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO CONSUME IN THE WAYS. THAT THEY WERE BEFORE NOT TO MENTION INCREASED HEALTH CARE COSTS. THAT COME FROM A VERY LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THESE WORKERS NOT HAVING ACCESS TO. ANY KIND OF HEALTHCARE. WE ALSO ECHO OTHER COMMENTS OF RODNEYAND OTHERS ABOUT SMALL BUSINESSES SUFFERING IN THIS MOMENT. PARTICULARLY IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY ALTHOUGH I IT'S GREAT TO HEAR- THAT LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY MIGHT COME BACK IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS. WE'RE GOING TO SEE A MUCH HARDER HIT. HARDER HIT ON SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE RESTAURANT SECTOR. AND OTHERS AND WAS MEANT AS WAS MENTIONED MANY SMALL BUSINESSES MAY NOT RE OPEN AT ALL. I'M SO I HAVE FIVE MAIN CLEAR KIND OF HIGHWAYS THAT WE BELIEVE. ARE IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER WITH REGARD TO LOW WAGE WORKERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES BECAUSE I WOULD AGREE THAT WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. THE FIRST IS TO SUPPORT THE HIGH ROAD TO PROFITABILITY THERE HAVE BEEN BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA RESTAURANTS AND OTHER SMALL BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO LIVABLE WAGES. AND GREATER EQUITY FOR WORKERS THEY'VE BEEN COMMITTING TO IT THEY'VE BEEN COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING. THE ILLS THAT FACED OUR INDUSTRIES THE SERVICE SECTOR PRIOR TO RUN A VIRUS- REAL RECHE RACIAL INEQUALITY GENDER INEQUALITY. A LACK OF ACCESS TO MORE ABILITY FOR WORKERS OF COLOR TO THE HIGHEST PAYING POSITIONS. IN THE RESTAURANT AND SERVICE SECTORS. I'M AND SO WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT HOW COULD YOU ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT HIGH ROAD. MODELS EVEN POST CRISIS AND SO ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON. WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE CALLED HIGH ROAD KITCHENS. IN WHICH WE HAVE SECURED A COMBINATION OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DOLLARS WAGE SUBSIDIES AND PRIVATE PHILANTHROPY. TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO SMALL BUSINESS RESTAURANTS THAT CONNECTS TO EQUITY STANDARDS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE INCREASING EQUITY FOR. A IMMIGRANTS PEOPLE OF COLOR WOMEN INCREASING BACK OF HOUSE FRONT OF HOUSE EQUITY IN A RESTAURANT. PROVIDE THESE DOLLARS TO RESTAURANTS TO ACTUALLY READ. OUR WORKERS AND REPURPOSE THEMSELVES COMMUNITY KITCHENS. EATING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN NEED INCLUDING OTHER ON IT WAIT SERVICE WORKERS. I WE LAUNCH THE PROGRAM LAST WEEK WE'RE GROWING IT TO ABOUT THIRTY RESTAURANTS OVER THE NEXT. WEEK OR SO AND CAN EXPAND IT MUCH BROADER IT ALLOWS FOR SELVES OF IT CREATES A MODEL OF SELF SUFFICIENCY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. BECAUSE WE CREATED A SITUATION IN WHICH THESE RESTAURANTS ARE ABLE TO GET A COMBINATION OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DOLLARS. TURN INTO A COMMUNITY KITCHEN BUT ALSO. ACCEPT HATE ORDERS SO THAT. CUSTOMERS ARE ABLE TO SUBSIDIZE REVEALS AYE AND ALLOWS FOR SOME SELF SUFFICIENCY AFTER AN INITIAL INVESTMENT ABOUT TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS RESTAURANT THAT'S COMING FROM A COMBINATION OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE. RESOURCES SO THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW WE HAVE CREATIVELY LOOK THAT PROMOTING THE HIGH ROAD TO PROFITABILITY IN A WAY THAT ALSO RE EMPLOYS PEOPLE. A SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESS AND SAVES MANY SMALL BUSINESSES- AND FEEDS LOTS OF PEOPLE IN NEED. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY ENCOURAGES GREATER EQUITY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. I'M SO SUPPORTS WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS AT THE SAME TIME I JUST WANT TO SAY ONE MORE WORD OF THAT. PROGRAM WHICH IS THAT- WE HAVE WE ARE ANNOUNCING TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT THEY CAN AND- A DOCTOR RESTAURANT SAVE THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD RESTAURANT BY ENROLLING THEM IN THIS PROGRAM ALLOWING THEM ACCESS TO THE COMBINATION OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DOLLARS. I'M THAT ALLOW THEIR RESTAURANT TO BECOME SELF SUFFICIENT OVER TIME. WE'RE ALSO TALKING TO EMERGENCY MANAGERS IN VARIOUS COUNTIES ABOUT MOVING PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS TO THESE RESTAURANTS. OR MEALS SO THERE IS A WAY IN WHICH WE CAN PUT TOGETHER PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DOLLARS TO SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT ARE COMMITTED TO THE HIGH ROAD TO PROFITABILITY THAT'S ONE. THE SECOND IS THAT WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF POTENTIAL IN THE IDEA OF COOPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT BOTH WORKER AND CONSUMER COOPERATIVES. WHERE THE FUTURE WE'VE GOT MILLIONS OF LAID OFF WORKERS WITH LOTS OF SKILLS I WOULD AGREE THAT THERE LOW WAGE BUT NOT THAT THEY'RE LOW LOS. THESE ARE HIGH SKILL WORKERS WITH LOW WAGES THAT HAVE BEEN LAID OFF. THEY CAN COME TOGETHER IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF COOPERATIVES HEARING COOPERATIVES CARE COOPERATIVES DOMESTIC WORK COOPERATIVES. THAT ALLOW FOR WORKERS TO COME TOGETHER AND PROVIDE SERVICES AS WE BEGIN TO REOPEN. BECAUSE NOT ALL BUSINESSES WILL COME BACK NOT ALL WORKERS WILL GET THEIR JOBS BACK. BUT THE ABILITY TO SUPPORT THESE WORKERS AND COMING TOGETHER AND ACTUALLY STARTING THEIR OWN SERVICES AND BUSINESSES. DOES EXIST THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE THAT CAN SUPPORT THESE WORKERS- IN PROVIDING IN SETTING UP THESE COOPERATIVES WE COULD ALSO LOOK AT. BUSINESSES THAT CHOOSE NOT TO REOPEN SELLING THEIR BUSINESSES TO THEIR WORKERS. I'M THERE'S PLENTY OF CONVERSION THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST COOPERATIVE CONVERSION AND COULD CONTINUE TO HAPPEN THAT'S NUMBER TWO. NUMBER THREE ARE THROUGH THE WORK WITH THE HIGH ROAD KITCHENS WE LOOKED AT WHICH WHICH HELPS YOU DOLLARS AND WORK SHARE MODELS AND- SOME OF THESE DOLLARS ARE LIMITED TO EMPLOYERS THAT. ARE ARE STILL OPEN AND ARE GREEN TO KEEP THEIR WORKERS WELL THERE'S PLENTY OF BUSINESSES THAT HAVE ALREADY LAID OFF THEIR WORKERS. AND WE LOVE TO SEE WORK SHARE. ANOTHER WAGE SUBSIDY PROGRAMS EXPANDED BEYOND BUSINESSES THAT HAVE ALREADY LAID EVERYBODY THAT OF OUR THAT STILL HAVE PEOPLE TO INCLUDE BUSINESSES AND ALREADY LAID EVERYBODY OFF SO THAT THEY CAN GET SOME SUBSIDIES AND SUPPORT. TO BRING PEOPLE BACK ON TO HIRE PEOPLE BACK. TO MORE THINGS I'M- I THINK THIS MOMENT HAS MADE IT VERY CLEAR WHY UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE IS SO CRITICAL. IT'S A BURDEN ON SMALL BUSINESS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE TO WORKERS AND IT'S A TERRIFYING MOMENT RIGHT NOW FOR LOTS OF WORKERS. THAT ARE LOSING THEIR ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE BECAUSE IT'S BEEN TIED TO THEIR LAWYER. UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE WOULD REDUCE THE STATE'S COSTS IT WOULD REDUCE THE STATE'S BURDEN OF LOTS OF UNINSURED PEOPLE. TURNING TO THE PUBLIC SYSTEM. AND NOT HAVING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE AND FURTHERING THE CRISIS EVEN AS WE COME OUT OF IT. IT WOULD ALSO SUPPORT UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS AND WE ALSO NEED TO BE HEALTHY. IN A MOMENT LIKE THIS THE UNIVERSE HEALTHCARE WOULD. ALLOW THE STATE'S ECONOMY TO ACTUALLY BE SAVE LOTS OF HEALTHCARE COSTS AND LASTLY WE DO KNOW THE STATE IS GOING TO LOOK NEED TO LOOK AT INCREASED REVENUE. I'M SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES FIRST IS A BALLOT MEASURE THAT IS ON THE NOVEMBER BALLOT. THAT WOULD BRING REVENUE INTO THE STATE IT WOULD SUPPORT SCHOOLS AND LOCAL SERVICES. IT WOULD HAVE LARGE COMPANIES THAT ARE BENEFITING FROM THE CRISIS TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. I'M AND IT WOULD MOST IMPORTANTLY AS RODNEY MENTION IS IMPORTANT THING KEEP OUR SCHOOLS OPEN. SO THEY'RE OURS ABOUT THEIR SCHOOLS AFFECTING ABOUT TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS IN ABOUT TWENTY FIVE DISTRICTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT ARE SLATED TO BE CLOSED. NEXT MONTH. I WE HIGHLY ENCOURAGE THE STATE TO LOOK AT THAT I KNOW YOU'RE HAVING AN EDUCATION. MANY HEARING TOMORROW ON IT WOULD BE A REALLY BIG MISTAKE TO CLOSE SCHOOLS RIGHT NOW WHEN WE KNOW THAT MORE FISCAL DISTANCING FOR STUDENTS WILL BE NECESSARY IN THE FALL. WE NEED TO KEEP SCHOOLS OPEN. I'M NOT AVOID PERMANENT CLOSURES. AT THE MOMENT. AND THEN LASTLY I JUST WANT TO SAY TO PROTECTIVE MEASURES ONE. OR WORKERS AS FOR BOTH ESSENTIAL WORKERS NOW AND FOR WORKERS COMING BACK. WE MUST HAVE PP WE MUST HAVE PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT WE MUST HAVE EXPANDED PAID LEAVE. AND WORKERS NEED A VOICE ON THE JOB WITH REGARD TO HEALTH AND SAFETY IF WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WORK PLACES ARE SAFE. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THA EVERY WORKPLACE HAS A HEALTH AND SAFETY COMMITTEE IN WHICH WORKERS ARE ALL TO SEE. ABOUT IS THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN AND THAT OUR BUSINESS REOPEN WORKERS ARE SAFE AND THE AND CONSUMERS ARE SAFE AS WELL. AND LASTLY WITH REGARD TO PUBLIC SECTOR JOBS. WE DID NOT ACTUALLY RECOVER THE NUMBER OF PUBLIC SECTOR JOBS FROM THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN RECESSION WE'RE STILL A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS JOB AS OUR HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND JOBS BELOW PRE RECESSION LEVELS IF YOU TAKE. APPELLATION GROWTH INTO ACCOUNT. UP CUTTING PUBLIC SERVICES DURING THIS RECESSION WILL NEGATIVELY AFFECT THOSE MOST IN NEED AND CREATE A DRAG ON THE ECONOMY SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT CUTTING PUBLIC IN POINT EMPLOYMENT. ON THE CONTRARY WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN HIRE LOTS OF WORKERS IN PUBLIC SECTOR JOBS TO BE DOING CONTACT TRACING. WE CAN LOOK AT INFRASTRUCTURE AND A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS. AND SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE KEY IDEAS WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU LIKE THERE'S LOTS OF WAYS TO SUPPORT HIGH ROAD BUSINESSES. AND WORKERS AT THE SAME TIME SUPPORT COOPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT RING REVENUE INTO THE STATE AND SURE EVERYBODY HAS ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE SO THAT WE DON'T. FURTHER BURDENS STATE HEALTH. THANK YOU SO MUCH VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT. NEXT WE'RE GONNA HAVE OUR LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S MR PANIC SPEAK. OKAY HELLO MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO BE HERE TODAY. I GET CREDIT QUICKLY OF ALICE I WOULD- BEGIN JUST BY HAVE GOING BACK- LOOK ON SOMETHING PROFESSOR NICHOLS BURKE SAID THAT CLEARLY IS THE ECONOMY HAS ENTERED INTO A RECESSION. AND IT APPEARS TO BE THE EARLY SEVERE WANTED THAT. OUR OFFICE IS CURRENTLY DEVELOPING IT'S THIS CALL ESTIMATES. WERE THEY COMING BUDGET YEAR AND THE- THE CURRENT ONE. AND WE DON'T HAVE PRECISE ESTIMATES TO DISCUSS TODAY BUT I THINK I CAN MAKE THREE OBSERVATIONS WITH SOME CONFIDENCE AT THIS POINT. THE FIRST IS THAT THE STATE IS PRETTY CLEARLY GONE FROM ANTICIPATED- SURPLUS IN NOW EIGHTEEN BUDGET PROBLEM BY WHICH I MEAN. THE STATE'S REVENUES ARE LIKELY TO BE INSUFFICIENT TO COVER TO EXISTING COMMITMENTS. THE SECOND POINT IS THAT THE- BUDGET PROBLEM AS IT USUALLY DOES WHEN THERE'S A RECESSION WILL LIKELY SPANNED MORE THAN ONE BUDGET CYCLE. AND THEN THIRD GIVEN THE DIS THE SEVERITY OF THE DOWNTURN THERE'S BEEN DESCRIBED. IT'S LIKELY THAT THE BUDGET PROBLEM ITSELF IN TOTAL WILL EXCEED THE STATE'S ACCUMULATED BUDGET RESEARCH. AND HAS THE CHAIR MENTIONED IN HIS OPENING REMARKS. THIS STATE IS CONSTRAINED BY ITS BALANCE BUT REQUIREMENTS. THEREIS GENERALLY MEANS THAT AN INCREASE IN SPENDING IN ONE AREA MUST BE OFFSET BY REDUCED SPENDING IN ANOTHER AREA WHERE BY BRINGING IN ADDITIONAL REVENUES IN THE FORM OF HIGHER TAXES. IS THE USUAL WAY. NEVERTHELESS GIVEN THE ECONOMIC CRISIS THEY WERE FACING THERE'S A REAL. AND PUTTING DOLLARS INTO THE ECONOMY- ISSUING BONDS FOR EXAMPLE IS SOMETIMES THOUGHT OF THIS AS ONE OF THE WAY TO DO THIS BY ACCELERATING THE PLANNED BOND ISSUANCE SCHEDULE AND- FINANCING CAPITAL PROJECTS WITH THE BOND PROCEEDS. THAT COULD BE BACK TO ONE IDEA THAT IS SOMETIMES MENTIONED AS A WAY TO BRING AND STIMULUS HOWEVER I THINK THE LEGISLATURE MUST KEEP IN MIND THAT DOING THAT. BRINGS WITH IT HI YOUR COSTS DOWN THE ROAD TO SERVICE THE DEBT. IN ADDITION WHEN THE NEED IS REALLY TO BRING FUNDS INTO THE ECONOMY QUICKLY. THERE'S A TIME PROBLEM BECAUSE THE BOND. LANDING THE LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN A RANGE YOU NEED IN THE FINANCING X. TIME IT MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE MOMENT WE'RE IN. SO IN GENERAL THERE ARE TWO WAYS THAT THE STATE CAN SPEND MORE. THAN ITS CURRENT REVENUE BASE WILL ALLOW WITHOUT MAKING ACCENTING REDUCTIONS IN OTHER AREAS WERE BY INCREASING TAX REVENUE. AND THE FIRST IS TO BORROW INTERNALLY BASICALLY SPEND SOME OF THE BALLOTS IS HELD IN THE STATE'S SPECIAL FUNDS. AND THE OTHER IS JUST TO SPEND DOWN IT'S MAKING RATED BUDGET RESERVE. BUT WHEN YOU PUT IT ALL TOGETHER I MEAN THE STATE'S OPTIONS WERE PROVIDING ECONOMIC STIMULUS ARE REALLY VERY LIMITED DANCE COMPARED. WHICH IS GOING TO HEAR MENTIONED IN ABLE TO RUN LARGE THAT. THE ECONOMY. NOW THERE'S ONE EXCEPTION TO THIS AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT OUR OFFICE IS WRITTEN ABOUT AND GIVEN TO THE COMMITTEE TODAY IS INTERESTED IN POLICY IDEAS AS WELL AS A DISCUSSION OF THE BUDGET SITUATION- MENTION ONE OF THEM HERE TODAY MATT IS THAT THE STATE COULD IF THE LEGISLATURE WANTED THE STATE COULD BORROW FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITHIN ITS- UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM. WHAT IS THE BY WAY OF BRIEF BACKGROUND THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM. IS A SAFETY NET PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES A CASH BENEFIT YOU WORKERS THAT LOSE THEIR JOBS YOU TO NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. STATES GENERALLY HAVE PRETTY BROAD DISCRETION FOR THE DESIGN OF THE IT OF THERE BENEFITS PROGRAMS. AND IN CALIFORNIA THE MAXIMUM WEEKLY BENEFIT IS FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS AND THE DURATION OF THE PROGRAM IS A MAXIMUM OF TWENTY SIX WEEKS. THE WAY THAT THESE BENEFITS ARE PAID FOR THROUGH AN EMPLOYER OR PAYROLL TAX ON THE FIRST SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OF EMPLOYEE WAGES. THE COLLECTIONS FROM THESE TAXES ARE HOLDING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE TRUST FUND. THREE COMMONERS BEEN THE CASE THAT IN RECESSIONS THESE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE TRUST FUND WILL GO INTO INSOLVENCY. NEVERTHELESS THE BENEFITS CONTINUE TO BE PAID BECAUSE IN THE IN AN EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AUTOMATIC STABILIZER PROGRAMS. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EXTENDS LOANS SORT OF EMERGENCY AN AUTOMATIC LOANS TO THE STATE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BUT- NEITHER THE- THE FUNDS THEY CAN THEN BE USED TO CONTINUE TO PAY. THE BENEFITS EVEN THOUGH THE FUND ITSELF IS GONZALEZ. IN IT IT IS THIS ARRANGEMENT PRECISELY THAT WOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THE STATE TO INCREASE ITS ITS OWN BENEFIT SCHEDULED FOR ME FIND TEMPORARY BASIS. AND UTILIZE BORROWED FUNDS BECAUSE- AN INCREASE THE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE STATE INCREASES IN. THE FUND IS LIKELY TO GO INTO AND SOLVE IT THE DECISION GIVEN THE SEVERITY OF THIS DOWNTURN. WHAT DO WE THIS KIND OF IN MY TO THE PRO OF COURSE WOULD QUIT FIND FURTHER INTO INSOLVENCY. BUT YOU KNOW AS I AM SAYING THAT THE BENEFITS COULD STILL BE PAID THROUGH THE- FEDERAL LOAN. NOW THE STATE COULD DESIGN THE INCREASES IN A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN HI U. FORMULA BASED ON EMPLOYEES AND THE WAGES THAT THE EMPLOYEE WAS EARNING BEFORE THEY LOST THEIR JOB. WORKING PROVIDING ACROSS THE BOARD AMEN- INSTILL OR TO THE FEDERAL CARES ACT RECENTLY THE FEDERAL CARES ACT INCLUDED TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY BILLION IN FUNDING TO PROVIDE A SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR PER WEEK INCREASE TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS WERE THE ONLY PEOPLE THIS YEAR IS NO ALSO EXTENDED THE PERIOD. OF KNOWLEDGE ABILITY BY THIRTEEN WEEKS. NOW THERE'S THE QUESTION OF HOW TO REPAY THIS LOAN IN THE NORMAL COURSE YEAH YOU KNOW WHEN THE FUN GOES IN SOLVING. THESE LOANS WHEN THEY'RE DRAWN UPON GET REPAID BY FUTURE TAX COLLECTIONS ON THE EMPLOYERS. IN THE PAST- WHEN THE IT IT THIS IS OCCURRED WHEN THE ECONOMY IS STRENGTHENED AND THEN USUALLY THE STATE GENERAL FUND HAS PAID THE INTEREST COST ON THOSE LONG. BUT GIVEN THE EXACT IN ITS NATURE OF THIS ECONOMIC SHOCK. AND THE BUT BECAUSE OF THE DOWNTURN IS AS PROFESSOR NICHOLS BURKE SAID WE'RE SORT OF IN A PAN DOOM AND DEREK INDUCED RECESSION. LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER RETAIN SEARCH LOANS STRAIGHT FROM THE GENERAL FUND WITHOUT SHIFTING THE BURDEN BACK TO THE EMPLOYERS DOWN THE ROAD. OUR OFFICE IS ALSO WRITTEN UP SOME EXAMPLE OF THE OTHER IDEAS STUDY THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER. THESE WOULD INCLUDE THINGS LIKE EXPANDING THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM TWO CATEGORIES OF WORKERS THAT ARE CURRENTLY INELIGIBLE. FOR EXPANDING THE STATE. PROGRAM YOU- WORKERS THAT ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. I'LL SPEND LESSTIME ON THOSE IS BECAUSE THOSE IDEAS WOULD NOT BE. ELIGIBLE FOR THE FEDERAL LOAN SUPPORT THAT I MENTIONED IN THE REGIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM. AND AS SUCH THEY WOULD REQUIRE THE USE OF STATE RESOURCES WHICH BRINGS BUT RANGERS BACK ABOUT A REGIONAL TRADE OFF THAT I MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING BECAUSE OF THE STATE'S BALANCED BUDGET REQUIRE. SO WITH THAT- BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS WHEN THE TIME COMES THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS BURKE- NEXT WE HAVE CHRIS HANEY WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET IN POLICY CENTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU TODAY WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN DAYS HEARING. MY REMARKS TODAY WILL FOCUS ON THE STATE'S OPTIONS FOR OUR RESPONSE TO THE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF THE CRISIS BUT PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO ARE MOST AFFECTED BY ISIS AND I WANT TO START BY STRESSING. AS HAS BEEN SAID HERE TODAY JUST HOW DIFFERENT THIS RECESSION IS ALREADY FROM THE FIRE EVEN IF THERE WILL BE A TENDENCY TO COMPARE IT IN TERMS OF SCALE IN SIZE TO THE DEPTHS OF THE GREAT RECESSION. WE HAVE AN EXPERIENCED GOING FROM FALL APPOINTMENT THE 15220% UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS. ARE SO QUICKLY IN THE LAST SIX WEEKS AT LEAST NOT IN OUR CONTEMPORARY HISTORY AND A RECESSION SO FOCUSED ON CERTAIN INDUSTRIES AND THE SERVICE SECTOR IN PARTICULAR. AND THAT MATTERS A LOT THE DECISIONS THAT YOU MAKE IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS AHEAD BECAUSE THE DEPTH OF THE EFFECTS ARE REQUIRE A TARGETED SAID OF PUBLIC SECTOR RESPONSES. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE CRISIS ITS IMPACT ON WORKERS AND FAMILIES AND TO PROTECT IT AGAINST BECOMING A LONGER TERM IN MORE SUSTAINED DOWNTURN WITH LASTING IMPACTS FOR THOSE CALIFORNIANS AND OUR ECONOMY. SEVERAL WEEKS AGO THAT WE OUTLINED A SET A KEY PRINCIPLES FOR HOW THE STATE CAN RESPOND. OUT THE KEY ONE OF THOSE WAS PROVIDING WELL TARGETED REALLY AYE WRAPPING AROUND THE FEDERAL FISCAL RELIEF THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED. IN THE SEVERAL PACKAGES THAT WERE PASSED IN THE LAST. MONTH OR SO. PRIORITIZING BEEN NEEDS- FOR THOSE WHO ARE MOST AFFECTED. AND HELPING CALIFORNIANS WHO WON'T BE REACHED BY EXISTING PROGRAMS AND SUPPORTS BECAUSE THEY'RE EXCLUDED VARIOUS REASONS. WE RELEASED A SERIES OF REFER PORTS EXAMINING WHO THE WORKERS ARE THAT ARE MOST AFFECTED BY THE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF THE CRISIS YOU CAN FIND THOSE RESOURCES AT OUR WEBSITE AT CAL BUDGET CENTER DOT ORG. THOSE MOST AFFECTED INCLUDE UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES- THEY MAKE UP 6% OF OUR STATE WORKFORCE IN SOME OF THE INDUSTRIES AND SECTORS THAT ARE MOST AFFECTED THEIR- AND THE 30% OF THE WORKFORCE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM RIGHT WORKERS WHO LIVE IN AND HELP SUPPORT MIXED. MIXED STATUS HOUSEHOLDS THAT INCLUDE U. S. CITIZENS THE CONTRIBUTORY BILLION DOLLARS TO YOU- THE STATE NEW TAXES AND NOT HOWEVER THEY'RE LOCKED OUT OF MUCH OF THE FEDERAL FISCALLY AND SOME OF THE SAME SYSTEMS OF SUPPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN. MENTIONED HERE TODAY. AMONG THOSE MOST AFFECTED ARE ALSO PEOPLE OF COLOR. AMONG WORKERS AT HIGH RISK OF LOSING THEIR JOBS OR HOURS BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN WHERE THEY WORK IN A HIGHLY AFFECTED IN THE THREE TWO ONE THREE. ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR THEY ALSO TEND TO BE WORKERS WHO HAVE LESS EDUCATION RELATIVELY SPEAKING AND WHO ARE PAID LASSEN HAVE EITHER. YOU ARE JOB PROTECTIONS. MANY OF THESE FOLKS ACROSS THOSE WHO'VE BEEN LEFT OUT OR WHO ARE. VERY AFFECTED ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS. THEY WORK ACROSS INDUSTRIES AND SECTORS SECTORS THEY ARE NEIGHBORS AND COWORKERS AND MANY OF THEM ARE NOW FACING EACH. ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. WHICH BRINGS ME TO WHAT YOU WALKING DO POTENTIALLY AT THE STATE LEVEL. WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THINKING ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL AND- IN TERMS OF GAPS AROUND FEDERALLY SO. I'LL START WITH CASH ASSISTANCE ARE THE FEDERAL REBATES AS EVERYONE. COMMONLY REFERS TO THEM THEY WERE AUTHORIZED MEDICARE'S ACT. THEY NOTABLY EXCLUDE UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS WITH FEDERAL INDIVIDUAL TAX IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS ARE AYE TENDS. AND THEY REQUIRE THAT EVERYONE IN THE HOUSEHOLD THAT RECEIVES A REBATE HOW TO SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. IN OTHER WORDS THE REBATE THE REBATES THEMSELVES ARE NOT AVAILABLE THE MOST. ECONOMIC STATUS EMILY. AT THE GOVERNOR TO AN EXECUTIVE ORDER A PROVIDED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS SUPPLEMENTED BY FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM PLAN TO BE A ONE TIME CASH ASSISTANCE FOR THESE WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. THAT'S A REALLY GREAT FIRST STEP- BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S ALSO CLEAR THAT THE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF CRISIS WILL CONTINUE BEYOND THE IMMEDIATE AREA. THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE I BOTH TAKE CASH ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT. AT THAT- AT THE STATE COULD PROVIDE AND THAT ALSO OFFSET ACT THAT IS WORKERS ARE UNDER- ELIGIBLE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. ALSO THE WAY THAT THE LEGISLATURE TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS IT CONSIDER BUILDING ON TO THE CAL EITC ON THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT. INCLUDE AYE TEN FILERS INCREASING THE SIZE OF A CREDIT FOR THOSE HOUSEHOLDS THAT WOULD. OTHERWISE BE RECEIVING SMALL AMOUNTS. IN THE HOW CARE THERE WAYS TO HELP UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS HAVE BEEN MENTIONED HERE TODAY. I MEAN SURE THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE WHICH IS PIVOTAL TO ADDRESSING THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND ECONOMIC HAS ASPECTS OF THE CRISIS. MOST UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS STILL LACK ON GOING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE COVERAGE. MISTAKE SHOULD CONTINUE TO TRY TO MAKE PROGRESS ENSURING THAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE. FOR MEDICARE. IN PAID LEAVE THE FEDERAL LEAVE NOTABLY EXCLUDED EMPLOYERS WITH MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES THAT'S FORTY FOUR PERCENT. OF CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE OR ABOUT EIGHT MILLION WORKERS. WE APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER ADDRESSING THE GAP FOR FOOD INDUSTRY WORKERS. AT THE EXPIRED SPENDING WORK PROTECTION FOR ELIGIBLE- ROAD WORKERS FOR PAID FAMILY LEAVE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT DEPENDING ON WHAT'S INCLUDED IN FAVOR OF EACH- FEDERAL RELIEF CALIFORNIA MAY NEED TO CONSIDER LOOKING AT OTHER OPTIONS PROVIDING ADDITIONAL PAID LEAVE AND PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS. CARING FOR CHILDREN OR ADULTS WHO ARE UNABLE TO WORK. THERE'S ALSO A GAP IN THE CHILD CHILD CARE IN A CALIFORNIA WILL RECEIVE THREE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERALLY SUPPORT CHILD CARE ASSISTANCE. I'VE BEEN GIVEN THE MOST CHILD CARE PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN FORCED A TEMPORARY EXPEDIENT SHELTER IN PLACE ORDERS. MANY ESSENTIAL WORKERS ARE STRUGGLING TO MANAGE WORK AND CHILDCARE RESPONSIBILITIES AND WE KNOW THAT THERE WERE LARGE GAPS FIRED IN. THE STATE FOR EXAMPLE COULD MAKE AUTHORIZED FUNDS DIRECTED. ALREADY AUTHORIZED FUNDS THEY'RE PROVIDED FOR FACILITIES AVAILABLE FOR IMPROVEMENTS- I'M SORRY AVAILABLE TO HELP COVER OPERATING COST FOR SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE PROVIDERS. DURING THE CRISIS IS JUST ONE WAY THE STATE MIGHT RESPOND. OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE OUT OF WORK WE KNOW THAT THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM COMES INTO PLAY FORTUNATELY THE STATE INCREASED THE GROUT LEVELS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. AMID THE LIKELY INCREASES IN CASELOADS AND CHALLENGES IT'S REVENUES MAKING SURE THAT THOSE BENEFITS ARE NOT. THAT SHOULD BE A PRIORITY AND EXTENDING THE CAL WORKS I'M LIMITS WOULD BE A GOOD POLICY TO START PUTTING IN PLACE NOW IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THOSE LIMITS ARE EXTENDED FOR PEOPLE. LAST WORD. BOTTOM LINE EVEN WITH HAVING TO BALANCE THE STATE BUDGET AND RECOGNIZING THE FISCAL REALITIES INTERFERE IN THAT ARE COMING. WE SUBMIT THAT YOU HAVE TO FIND WAYS TO PROP UP THE ECONOMIC. SECURITY OF THE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WERE BOTH ACTIVE. RECOGNIZE YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO DO EVERYTHING YOU MIGHT. OTHERWISE WISH IT BE ABLE TO DO. WE THINK ABOUT THIS IS BASICALLY HAVING TWO SETS OF OUR LEVEL SPONSOR. ONE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH BECAUSE THE ECONOMY WILL BE HEALTHY UNTIL WE'RE ASSURED. THE CRISIS IS MITIGATED. AND ONE FOR THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF THE NINETEEN. EVERYTHING ELSE IS PRETTY MUCH SECONDARY I RECOGNIZE YOU HAVE SOME CHALLENGING DECISIONS AHEAD OF YOU BUT YOU SHOULD USE WHAT RESOURCES AND SESSIONS YOU HAVE AVAILABLE ADDRESS THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND- ECONOMIC CHALLENGE THIS PRICES. OUR STATE HAS SHOWN THAT IT CAN WHETHER DOWNTURNS ANTI FISCALLY PRUDENT BUILD RESERVES NEEDED TO PREPARE FOR FUTURE NEEDS. ALSO MAKERS IN CALIFORNIA CAN READ THE STATE FOR IT AGAIN BY ENSURING THAT THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES NO WORKERS HIT HARDEST. AND THE ECONOMY ECONOMY OVERALL DON'T PAY THE PRICE FOR THIS CRISIS HERE'S THE CON. THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR IN THE COMMUTER MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY AND I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS NEEDED AT THAT. TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH REALLY JUST A BIG THANK YOU FOR ALL OUR OUR PANELISTS- WANTED JUST CALL ON MISTER- THESE WHEN HE CAN IF YOU HAVE ANY. COMMENTS ON- ON THE- PANEL OR HE JUST WANTS TO TAKE QUESTIONS. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHANG AND THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THAT COMMITTEE- WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR ALL THE COMMENTS OF THE PANEL- WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING ON THE NAY REVISION- WHICH AS YOU KNOW IS- WILL BE. PROVIDED IN JUST OVER TWO WEEKS AND- WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GONNA GO TO MISTER COOPER AND THEN DOCTOR WOULD. THANK YOU MISTER MILLER THANK EVERYBODY FOR BEING HERE AND JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS. FOR MISTER ALL HAM. WHAT CHANGES HAVE YOU MADE YOUR BUSINESS- STAFFING HAILING PRODUCTS AND SHIPPING PRODUCTS. GREAT GREAT QUESTION GOING BACK REALLY A COUPLE MONTHS AGO MANY CHANGES SO EVERYTHING KINDA REVOLVES AROUND JUST I WOULD SAY. HI GENE WHICH IS NOTHING NEW TO US AS A FOOD COMPANY AND THEN PHYSICAL DISTANCE AND SEPARATION IT'S REQUIRING SOCIAL DISTANCE SITTING WAITING BARRIERS- MAKING ACCOMMODATIONS FOR EMPLOYEES FOR ATTENDANCE WE ALREADY HAVE GENEROUS LEAVE POLICIES HERE SO THAT HELPED FACILITATE THINGS ON THAT WE PUT TEMPERATURE SCREENING IN PLACE. WHAT MASKS AND P. B. E. AND EVERYONE'S HANDS- THAT'S YOUR WORK AND SO THAT'S A LOT OF A LOT OF ACTIVITY AROUND THAT INTO THANKS AND HOW MANY EMPLOYEES DO YOU HAVE THERE YOUR FACILITY THE FACILITIES I JUST. JUST JUST SHY ABOUT THOUSAND HERE IN CALIFORNIA. OBVIOUSLY YOU AYE WE IN CENTRAL VALLEY WE'VE A LOT AG I KNOW AG IS A FIFTY BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA AS FAR AS GETTING YOUR FOLKS YOU KNOW BACK TO WORK. HELP IS REGULATION IMPACTED YOU. RELATIONS FROM FROM THE STATE. WE ALSO. IT IN TERMS OF THIS COULD YOU MAYBE BE A JUST A LOT MORE SPECIFIC IN TERMS OF THE SITUATION- PREVIOUSLY OR HOW HOW CAN WE MAKE IT EASIER TO DO BUSINESS OBVIOUSLY WITH THAT TO MAKE SURE EMPLOYEES CONTINUE TO. REMAIN EMPLOYED. OKAY NO I THINK I MEAN YOU'RE GONNA HIT NINE ONE OF THE POINTS I HAD IN TERMS OF. NOT ADD MORE WEIGHT TO THE SHIPS- SO AT THIS POINT IN TIME I JUST BELIEVE JUMPSTART AND THE ECONOMY AND GETTING PEOPLE BACK TO WORK AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE AND NOT WAY AND IT'S DOWN IN THE WAY IT IS. IMPORTANT SO. NOW I AND WAIT ON THE SHIPS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT THING RIGHT NOW. AND FOR MISTER NICHOLS BERG- HOW LONG WILL SMALL BUSINESS BE ABLE SURVIVE WITH A SHELTER IN PLACE. HOW LONG WILL SMALL BUSINESS BE ABLE TO SURVIVE WITH THE STRUCTURE IN PLACE THAT'S AND THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION IN ANY. RECESSION WE FIND THAT BUSINESSES THAT WERE GOING INTO THE RECESSION WITH THAT VERY LOW MARGINS HAVE A HARD TIME MAKING IT THROUGH. THE IN THIS CASE IT DEPENDS ON. WELL REALLY ON WHAT SECTOR THERE IN. AND THAT HOW CONSUMERS COME BACK SO FOR EXAMPLE. IN THE RETAIL SECTOR THERE WILL BE MANY RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS- SMALL AND MEDIUM AND EVEN LARGE RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS. THAT ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO. COME BACK THEY WILL TRY TO OPEN UP AND THEN THE EXPERIENCE OF THE PAST SAYS THAT THEY WILL. END UP IN BANKRUPTCY AND IN CLOSING SO IN THE RETAIL SECTOR WE EXPECT A PERMANENT SHRINKAGE. IN LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY IT DEPENDS ON WHETHER OR NOT THIS FIRM IS SERVING. EARLY TOURISTS OR PRIMARILY A LOCAL RESIDENTS AND IN THE- ARENA OF TOURISM WE EXPECT INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM TO BE NEEDED FOR A VERY LONG TIME WAY PAST THAT TWENTY TWENTY TWO DOMESTIC TERRORISM SHOULD START PICKING UP PEOPLE ARE ANXIOUS TO GET OUT. NOT THAT IT AGAIN THAT'S NOT A FULL RECOVERY IN THE TOURIST SECTOR SO THOSE ARE THE WEAKEST SECTORS IN IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THOSE ARE SECTORS THAT EMPLOYEE- REALLY AREN'T ON AVERAGE LOWER INCOME CALIFORNIANS THAN OTHER SECTORS AND THAT'S WHY I WANT TO HIT ON THAT IS THERE ANY MODELING THIS BEEN DONE. REGARDING THAT. SO THAT IN MODELING AS TO THE- LONGEVITY OF SMALL BUSINESS IN THESE SECTORS CORRECT. AND NOT EXPLICIT MODELING BUT THE DATA THAT WE OBSERVE ON THE EMPLOYMENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT IN THESE SECTORS FROM PAST RECESSIONS ARE INDICATIVE OF WHAT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THIS. RECESSION AND RECOVERY STILL IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTER OF THIS YEAR WE EXPECT BUSINESS FAILURES AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE RECESSION WHICH WE I ANTICIPATE WILL AND- SOMETIME IN THE THIRD QUARTER AS WE KNOW SMALL BUSINESSES THE BACKBONE OF ALL BUSINESS EMPLOYS A LOT OF FOLKS- IN OUR DISTRICTS. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF SMALL BUSINESS DO YOU FEEL WILL NOT SURVIVE AND MAKE IT BACK. OFFERED DIFFERING NUMBERS. AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THE NUMBERS THAT YOU'VE HEARD ARE SPECULATIVE. SO I'M GOING TO HESITATE TO SPECULATE BUT- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY IN RETAIL AND IN. THOSE BUSINESSES THAT ARE SERVING- TOURISM. AS THE NUMBER MIKE QUITE HIGH. THANK YOU. DOCTOR WHAT. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND THANK YOU TO THE PANELISTS THIS IS BEEN REALLY HELPFUL- AND I'M GOING TO PREFACE SYSTEM THERE WOULD BE COM AT HER QUESTIONS- COMING OUT OF THIS BUT I A ON SATURDAY HAVE THE SECOND NOW CALL WITH OUR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS IN MY DISTRICT I REPRESENT FIVE COUNTIES. AND A COUPLE OF THINGS IF HAVE COME UP ONE IS- AND A MAYBE IT MAYBE- MARCO MIGHT BE ABLE TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION THERE IS A DESIRE TO START AS WE START LOOKING AT RE OPENING- TO CHANGE THE WAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUSINESSES VERSES ESSENTIAL VERSES NONESSENTIAL TO SAFE VERSES MAYBE NOT SO SAFE- AND IS THE IS THE ADMINISTRATION ANTICIPATING ANY SORT OF A CHANGE BECAUSE IF YOU'RE A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER. YOU PROBABLY CONSIDER YOUR BUSINESS ESSENTIAL IT'S ESSENTIAL TO YOUR FAMILY IT'S ESSENTIAL TO THE PEOPLE YOU EMPLOY AND- IT'S ESSENTIAL TO YOUR COMMUNITY IN MANY WAYS AND SO THAT WHILE WE WERE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THIS AND RAMPING UP- AND LOOKING AT THE SURGE- THAT TERMINOLOGY MAY HAVE BEEN MORE APPROPRIATE BUT AS WE MOVE FORWARD I HAVE TO FEEL LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF BUSINESS OWNERS THAT COULD BE OPERATING- SAFELY. GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO I THINK LIKE AN ACCOUNTING FOR EXAMPLE MAY HAVE A SMALL COUNTY FUHRMAN HAS ITS OWN PRIVATE OFFICE REACH EMPLOYEE OR AN ATTORNEY'S FIRM THAT HAS THE SAME SORT OF- SAME SORT OF- ARRANGEMENT OUT THERE. SO IS THERE ANY ANTICIPATION OF THE SORT OF A CHANGE IN THE WAY WE LOOK AT BUSINESSES- AND SORT OF THE JARGON THAT WERE USING DESCRIBE WHETHER A BIT YOU KNOW WHETHER BUSINESS COULD BE OPEN OR NOT. WELL THANK YOU FOR. THAT QUESTION THIS IS MARCO WITH THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. I HAVE I THINK THAT- YOU'RE CORRECT IN THE SENSE THAT YOU KNOW AND WE LOOK AT THE SIX INDICATORS THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS LAID OUT. WHAT WE ARE REALLY TRYING TO FOCUS ON IS FIGURE OUT WAYS IN WHICH BUSINESS SAYS AMONGST VARIOUS SECTORS OF OUR ECONOMY. AND SAFELY OPEN UP- BASED ON- PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE AND ANYTHING TO YOUR PANELISTS EARLIER UP POINTS FOR MAKING SURE THAT WE PROVIDE. A CLEAR CONCISE AND TIMELY GUIDANCE IS GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT AND SO WE ARE ENGAGING. WITH THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS FALLS IN RURAL AND URBAN COUNTIES. AND BETTER UNDERSTAND KIND OF. WHAT THEY WHAT ARE THEIR LIMITATIONS AND HER CHALLENGES AND THEN ALSO BE IS VERY IS BUSINESS SECTORS THROUGH OUR GUIDE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF MEN BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. YOU REALLY GET A SENSE OF. HOW WE HAVE REALLY HAVE RE ENGAGE THE ECONOMY- FROM UP HEALTH SIDE OUR PUBLIC HEALTH SIDE- THAT REALLY DRIVES- DIFFERENT CHANGES. BASED ON THE GUIDANCE SO WE ISSUE AT THE STATE LEVEL OR GUIDANCE THAT LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ISSUE. I TO MAKE SURE THAT TWO THINGS ONE THAT- THE EMPLOYEES ARE SAFE AND THEN THAT ALSO THAT CUSTOMERS OR THE PUBLIC OUR STATE WHEN. WHEN INTERACTING WITH- WITH VERY SECTORS OF. THANK YOU. I THINK YOU'VE A CALL THEME HERE AND A HUGE CONCERN AND THAT'S PP. NOW PP IS GONNA BE REQUIRED PRETTY MUCH VIRTUALLY ON MOST BUSINESSES I WOULD IMAGINE- AND- THE FACT THAT I IT WENT THINK I HAVEN'T HEARD IS. IS THERE A TASK FORCE WORKING ON PP- BECAUSE IT IT VARIES FROM FROM PLACE TO PLACE LET ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE AND MISTER COOPER BROUGHT UP A REALLY GOOD. REALLY GOOD POINT WONDERING HOW BUSY HOW LONG WILL BUSINESSES WILL BE ABLE TO SURVIVE. SO I'M A DENTIST BY TRAINING AND DENTISTRY IS A HIGHLY INTENSE PP- USER. UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES NOW WE'VE ADDED- DISPOSABLE GOWNS- HEAD COVERINGS FACE SHIELDS MAYBE FOOT COVERINGS IN ADDITION TO GLOVES AND MASKS- THERE WERE DENTAL OFFICES AT ACTUALLY DONATED SUPPLIES- IN THE EARLY PARTS OF THIS. AND THEY'RE REALLY CONCERNED THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET PP WHEN THE SORE ALL CLEAR SIGNAL COMES OUT TO BE AGAIN TO READ RAMP UP- IF YOU WERE A SMALL OFFICE LIKE I WAS I HAD SEVEN EMPLOYEES- HOW MY GOING TO COMPETE. WITH THE WORLD OUT THERE TRYING TO GET PP IF YOU KNOW IF BIG HOSPITAL SYSTEMS AND CLINICS AND ALL THESE OTHER FOLKS ARE OUT THERE A WITH BIGGER BUYING POWER- AND MORE BETTER CONNECTIONS THAN I DO. AND THE REASON THIS BECOME SIGNIFICAN IS THAT. CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION HOLD THEIR MEMBERSHIP. AND THERE'S A BELIEF THAT IF THE DENTIST TREE ISN'T OPENED UP AND I MEAN REALLY OPENED UP- BY THE END OF JUNE. 20% OF THE OFFICES WILL CLOSE THEIR DOORS. AND IF IT DOESN'T GET OPERATE GOT GET OUT BEFORE THE END OF AUGUST. 50% NOW THINK ABOUT THAT FROM A PERSPECTIVE OF OUR SAFETY NET FOR EXAMPLE- I RESPONSIBILITY TO MEDI CAL. THE NUMBERS OF MEDI CAL RECIPIENTS ARE GOING UP IN THIS RECESSION AND THE PROVIDERS ARE GOING DOWN AND THIS IS JUST DENTISTRY THIS IS AN OPTOMETRY THIS ISN'T- MEDICINE THIS ISN'T PODIATRY THIS IS THIS IS JUST JUST DENTISTRY. AND THERE IS A HUGE CONCERN- ABOUT HOW THE VITALITY OF THEIR OF A BUSINESS RELATED TO THAT- SO THERE IS CONCERN AMONG MANUFACTURING I HAVE A FRIEND WHO DONATED SEVEN HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE MASKS TO- COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT. NOW WHEN HE GOES TO- TRY TO RE OPEN HIS MANUFACTURING BUSINESS HOW'S HE GOING TO GET THOSE SEVEN HUNDRED MASS I'M PRETTY SURE THEY'RE GONE AND SO- THINK OF FOOD PRODUCTION THINK OF- A SCHOOLS PUBLIC. AND WE HAVEN'T EVEN TALKED ABOUT PRIVATE SCHOOLS A PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS FOR ONE- WHAT ABOUT WINERIES AND BREWERIES- RIGHT NOW I KIND OF CONSIDER THEM ESSENTIAL FRANKLY BUT- ALSO IN MY DISTRICT COMMERCIAL FISHING- YOU KNOW AS WE LOOK AT SOCIAL DISTANCE SCENE AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND SO. SO QUESTION REALLY OUT OF THIS IS THERE GOING TO BE IS THERE A CONCERTED EFFORT IS THERE A TASK FORCE LOOKING AT THE PP PP ISSUE BECAUSE IT IS. THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM FOR pBUSINESS RIGHT NOW. HI GOOD MORNING DOCTOR WITH THIS IS TINA CURRY WITH THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS WERE DEFINITELY LOOKING AT THIS AT THE STATE LEVEL IT IS CONSIDERED PART OF WHAT WE CALL OUR LOGISTICS FUNCTIONS ARE LOGISTICS. FOLKS AS PART OF THE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS ARE NOT ONLY- LOOKING AT ALL THE OTHER RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS THAT WE ARE RECEIVING AT THE STATE. AND WORKING TO BE BUT WITHIN THAT. EP ITSELF IS ITS OWN I'M JUST JUST A BIG AREA THAT WE WE'VE BEEN CONTENDING WHERE IT. AND WE'RE ARE LOOKING TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT AS A NEW RICH RECOVERY BECAUSE I THINK AS YOU ARE AS YOU WERE SAYING THAT THAT THAT- ABILITY TO HAVE THAT- PROSPECTORS IS REALLY INSTRUMENTAL. THIS RECOVERY PIECE THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT TODAY SO IF YOU- EFFORTS ALONG THOSE LINES I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT. SOME OF THE OTHER HEARINGS WITH THE STATE'S DOING TO REALLY SECURE AND THAT DEDICATED SUPPLY LINE IN LARGE QUANTITIES. NOT JUST FOR HEALTHCARE BUT FOR OTHER EFFORTS BUT THE SAME TIME I THINK AND I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT THING THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING IS THAT EITHER TO TEASING ARE NORMALLY HAD A WAY OF. SECURING OUT ON THEIR OWN WHETHER IT'S PRIVATE SECTOR- OR OR OTHER ENTITIES AND THAT SUPPLY LINE IS JUST NOT AVAILABLE OR THERE'S JUST FUTURE COMPETITION OR AT. AND SO THAT THAT SUPPLY I'M OUTSIDE OF EVEN THE EMERGENCY NEED IT IS A PROBLEM AND- SO WE'RE PREPARED TO LOOK AT THAT TO NOT ONLY. YOU KNOW ASK THE SHORE THAT UP AS AN EMERGENCY NEED AND TELL THAT ONLINE BE CAN BECOME MORE STABLE OR PEOPLE TO. IT'S KIND OF BACKED DOWN BEGIN TO BURKE HERE ARE JUST SAY WE BACK DOWN FROM THE EMERGENCY BE ABLE TO- THINGS AS THEY NORMALLY WHITE SO. I TASK FORCE FOR SAY I WOULD SAY IT'S EMBEDDED WITHIN WHAT WE NORMALLY HAVE EMERGENCIES HICH IS A LOGISTICS COMPONENT AND WENT IN THAT IS THAT. IS THAT HE HE PART OF IT OR BOTH CV FOR CLASSIC DISTRIBUTING AND PRIORITIZING AS A BEACON BILL AS WE CAN BUILD ON. AND WE ARE CONTINUE WILL GET YOU NEED SUPPORT THAT AT THIS. NOT FOR AS LONG AS NEED. FOR THE DURATION OF THIS EMERGING. I HOPE THAT ALL WELL. HE YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT IT IS A PROBLEM I CAN SEE TO CRY QUITE IF YOU TELL A BILL THEY NOW- OPEN WHERE THEY CAN BEGIN TO HAVE A PLAN FOR OPENING AND THEY CAN'T GET PP. WE HAVEN'T ACCOMPLISHED ANYTHING QUITE FRANKLY AND THOSE BUSINESSES WILL CONTINUE TO SUFFER UNEMPLOYMENT WILL CONTINUE TO GO UP AND THE ECONOMY WILL CONTINUE TO TURN DOWN AND SO I GUESS WHAT I WAS HOPING FOR OUT OF THAT WAS THAT THERE IS A PLAN TO HELP WE ARE. THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY AND IN THE WORLD. COULD WE NOT FIGURE OUT A PLAN MAYBE TO ACTUALLY BEGIN TO PRODUCE OUR OWN PP THESE MASKS. AND ALL THESE OTHER THINGS ARE GOING TO BE A WAY OF LIFE FOR MONTHS AND MAYBE LONGER- AND I WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE THE STATE TO AT SHORING UP THINGS BECAUSE SHORING UP DOESN'T ACCOUNT FOR THE HUGE INCREASE. IN THE DEMAND IN THE NEED FOR THESE SUPPLIES YOU CAN SHORE UP THE SUPPLY CHAIN. BUT THAT SUPPLY CHAIN IS GROSSLY INADEQUATE RIGHT NOW AND IT'S GOING TO BE GROSSLY INADEQUATE FOR A LONG TIME. SO MY HOPE IS THAT YOU KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE A CONCERTED EFFORT BECAUSE I JUST THINK OF PEOPLE WHO GAVE AWAY THEIR PP AND THE SPIRIT OF WANTING TO HELP. NOW THEY'RE GOING TO GET A CHANCE TO REOPEN THEIR BUSINESS AND THEY WILL BE ABLE TO GET PP. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER I CONSIDER THIS A CRISIS QUITE FRANKLY ON TOP OF A CRISIS SO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE THE MISTER FUNK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF MY FIRST QUESTION IS FOR MR PADDOCK YOU HAD US IN TESTIMONY ABOUT CREATIVE USES OF THE TITLE TWELVE LOAN PROCESS TO BORROW MONEY- FORM THE FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT SYSTEM AND- I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD COMMENT ON- THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHER STATES WHICH HAS BEEN THAT THIS NEW- FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. BENEFIT OF SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A WEEK- OTHER STATES THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT AHEAD OF CALIFORNIA AND RE OPENING THEIR ECONOMIES HAVE FOUND THAT IN CERTAIN- WORK FOR SECTORS IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT TO HIRE BACK EMPLOYEES WHERE THE COMBINATION OF- STATE AND FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. CREATES AN ECONOMIC INCENTIVE FOR WORKERS NOT TO COME BACK TO WORK AND SO THEY'VE HAD PROBLEMS A PARTICULARLY IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY RE OPENING THOSE SECTIONS OF THE ECONOMY SO- MISTER PATRICK DO YOU FEAR THAT SHOULDN'T WE- IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM LIKE THE ONE THAT YOUR- THOSE PROBLEMS WOULD BE EXPERIENCED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. YES THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE I THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION. AND I THINK IT IS I THINK IN GENERALTHE IDEA THAT I. MENTIONED WAS BORN OUT OF BUT SOME BRAINSTORMING AND WE WERE DOING IN OUR OFFICE ABOUT WE USE. THAT THE STATE COULD GIVE IN ITS- OVER ARCHING BUDGET CONSTRAINTS AND THE ISSUES THAT I MENTIONED WE WERE TRYING TO DO SOME BRAINSTORMING ABOUT WAYS THE STATE COULD. YOU KNOW HELP GET FUNDS INTO THE ECONOMY. SO IT IS ONE WAY TO DO THAT AT THE SAME TIME I THINK THERE'S A VERY. MATERIAL TRADEOFFS BUT YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT INCLUDING THE FACT THAT IT ALONE WOULD HAVE TO BE REPAID ALTHOUGH I WOULD MENTION THAT THAT THERE IS ACT- MADE THE BILL FEDERAL LOAN INTEREST FREE AT LEAST FOR THE REMAINDER OF. TWENTY TWENTY BUT THEN THERE ARE ALSO THESE ARE ECONOMIC- INSTEAD OF. I OF QUESTION THAT YOU'RE- AND I THINK THAT THE ANY GOT SOMETHING THAT WOULD PROBABLY WARRANT FURTHER DISCUSSION PERHAPS WITH INCLUDED EXPERTS LIKE. PROFESSOR NIKOLSBURG OR OTHER ECONOMIST BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A VALID QUESTION AND SOMETHING THAT. THAT YOU KNOW THE- YOU WOULD WANT TO WAIT BEFORE BEFORE PROCEEDING. I THANK YOU AND TO FOLLOW ON TO THAT QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHEN MR PEDICLE WAS- SPEAKING ABOUT THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM HE MENTIONED A CONCERN ABOUT HOW THOSE LOANS GET REPAID. AND I WONDERED IF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAD- SOME- SOME INFORMATION FOR US ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW THOSE LOANS WOULD GET REPAID BECAUSE AS MR PADDOCK TESTIFIED IF WE DO NOTHING THAT ENTIRE BURDEN IS GOING TO FALL ON THE BACKS OF EMPLOYERS IN CALIFORNIA WHICH- WOULD BE A GROSS INJUSTICE AND STAY REALLY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS CRISIS. AND I CERTAINLY DIDN'T WANT TO LAY OFF THOSE EMPLOYEES OR MAKE THEM UNEMPLOYED. YES MISTER OBERNOLTE THIS IS TO MAKE THIS NOT THAT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I THINK- IN THE LAST RECESSION YOU ARE CORRECT THAT- AS MR PROTOCOL SO SAD. THE GENERAL FUND PAID THE INTEREST ON THE LOAN WHILE THE PRINCIPLE OF THE LOAN WAS PAID BACK THROUGH EMPLOYERS VIA FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT. TAXES I THINK THE WAY THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS RIGHT NOW- YOU KNOW AS OF APRIL SIXTEENTH WE STILL HAD ONE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS- IN OUR TRUST FUND BUT WE IMAGINE THAT THAT WILL BE DRAWN DOWN IN PRETTY SHORT ORDER WE- RECEIVED. AUTHORIZATION TO BORROW- AND WE WILL LIKELY YOU KNOW BE DOING BORROWING IN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR THE RAIN REMAINDER UP THIS YEAR- IT DEPENDING ON HOW THAT SITUATION INVOLVES. I THINK IT'S A DIFFICULT QUESTION TO ANSWER RIGHT NOW BECAUSE- AS YOU NOTED THIS WILL BE AN ADDITIONAL BURDEN ON EMPLOYERS JUST AS IT WAS DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. AT THE SAME TIME- THE GENERAL FUND WILL BE UNDER VERY SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE AND YOU'RE RIGHT NOW THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES DOING. OUR FINAL FORECASTING FOR THE NAY REVISION- BUT WE KNOW THAT WE AS WELL AS ALL OF YOU WANT TO MAKE VERY DIFFICULT AND EVEN PAINFUL DECISIONS. ABOUT HOW THE GENERAL FUND WILL BE ALLOCATED NOT ONLY THIS YEAR BUT IN SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THAT. SO THERE IS A TRADE OFF AND THAT IF THE GENERAL FUND PICKS UP SOME OF THE PRINCIPLE IN ADDITION TO THE INTEREST- THAT WILL BE MONEY THAT'S NOT AVAILABLE FOR OTHER PROGRAMS- INCLUDING UNDERSECRETARY. OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WHICH I KNOW IT'S BEEN A THEME OF SOME OF THE OTHER PANELISTS SO THERE'S NO REALLY. GOOD OR EASY ANSWER HERE AT ALL STATE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION WE'RE LOOKING AT THE SITUATION RIGHT NOW. I'M AS PART OF OUR DELIBERATIONS I JUST MAY NOT. A NAY CLASS AND OF THAT. BUDGET THIS YEAR BUT WE HAVEN'T BAR YEAH IT IS CERTAINLY A QUESTION OUR BROADER. PLAN AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE HOPING FOR A SMALL. SUPPORT BECAUSE MORE THAN FEDERAL GOT. THE LAST WILL BE DEPARTING THEIR OWN AND- OR THE GENERAL FUND. AS MISTER PATTON. THAT IF I GOVERNMENT HAS TO THAT THEY WILL NOT BE. CHARGING ANY INTO FIRST ON LOW. WITH THE REMAINDER OF. TWENTY TWENTY. I THE GOVERNOR AT HIGH SPEED. ASKED IF I GOVERNMENT. TO EXTEND THAT DAY. I IN ADDITION TO. WHEN IT. TO THE- YEAH JUST THE ENTRENCHED. WE'RE HOPING THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL STEP UP AND PROVIDE. FOR THEIR- THAT THERE IS WELL THEY HAD DONE IT WITH THE PANDEMIC. UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS BUT THE SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS PER WEEK BOOST. AND WE'RE HOPING THAT THEY RECOGNIZE AS YOU NOTED MISTER OBERNOLTE THAT WE ARE REALLY AN UNPRECEDENTED CIRCUMSTANCES HERE. AND SO WE'RE HOPING FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE AS WE WORK THROUGH THIS CRISIS. RIGHT THANK YOU I THINK THIS IS AS YOU SAY A DISCUSSION THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE- HOWEVER. I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT. WE OUGHT TO HOLD EMPLOYERS HARMLESS FOR. REPAYMENT OF THAT PRINCIPLE SINCE THEY REALLY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH- EITHER THE SITUATION THAT CAUSED. THE UNEMPLOYMENT OR OUR RECENT DECISION TO BORROW BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TITLE TWELVE LOANS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND SO. I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE A COMMITMENT BY THE ADMINISTRATION THAT. COME HELL OR HIGH WATER. THAT THE BURDEN OF REPAYING THIS PRINCIPLE IS NOT GOING TO FALL. ON THE BACKS OF CALIFORNIA'S EMPLOYERS- IN IS YOU KNOW. THE PROBLEMS THERE REALLY TO A KIND OF UNRELATED PROBLEMS AS A PROBLEMS OF REPAYING THE PRINCIPLE OF THOSE LOANS THAT WERE MAKING THIS YEAR. THERE'S ALSO THE RELATED PROBLEM. THAT EMPLOYERS ARE GOING TO FACE HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PREMIUMS BECAUSE OF. THE CLAIMS AGAINST THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE RESERVE ACCOUNTS AND THAT'S A PROBLEM WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE TO SINCE THAT'S ANOTHER- DIFFICULTY THAT REALLY THEY HAD NO- THEY HAD NO- A PARTNERSHIP IN MAKING- I'D LIKE TO HAVE ONE. LAST QUESTION IT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THAT REGARDS WERE RELATES TO THE ENFORCEMENT OF AB FIVE SO I KNOW IT'S AN ONGOING DISCUSSION THAT WE- HAVE BEEN HAVING WITH THE MINISTRATION. BEFORE THIS CRISIS SAID. THE PLAN WAS TO SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF STATE MONEY AND INCREASED ENFORCEMENT. FOR AB FIVE- BUT I'M WONDERING IF THE CURRENT SITUATION CHANGES THOSE PLANS BECAUSE- OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO GET PEOPLE BACK TO WORK AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE ONE ANYWAY THAT WE POSSIBLY CAN IN CALIFORNIA. AND IT WOULD SEEM LIKE ES- THE TESTIMONY TODAY WOULD INDICATE IF MORE OF OUR ECONOMY A SHIFTING TO WARDS WORKING FROM HOME. THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE MIGHT HAVE TO TAKE A PAUSE AND RETHINK. IN TERMS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB FIVE AND I WAS INTERESTED ONE MISTER ALLEN WITH A HALLMARK SHE'S COMPANY VERY ASTUTELY POINTED OUT. IF THE SHIP IS PARTIALLY SUBMERGED YOU DON'T THROW EXTRA WEIGHT ON THE SHIP IN THIS IS- WHAT OBVIOUSLY WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH CALIFORNIA SMALL EMPLOYERS SO I WONDER WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S STANCE IS. ON PERHAPS PAUSING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB FIVE AND ALSO IN WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO FIX SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE BEEN. IDENTIFIED WITH THAT LEGISLATION. YES I'LL SPEAK VERY BRIEFLY TO THAT AND THEN MY COLLEAGUE CHRIS **** WHO'S ON THE LINE AS WELL AND MAY BE ABLE. BOOKS SO IT IS A LOT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WE CONTINUE TO ENFORCE IT I THINK WE'VE SEEN WHAT THIS EMERGENCY MAKING SURE THAT WORKERS. KNOW WHO FEEL LIKE THEY'VE BEEN MISCLASSIFIED YOU KNOW THEY CAN CERTAINLY WORK WITH ARMS LIKE TO MORE DEPARTMENT BUT WE ALSO. BELIEVE THAT THE PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALSO PROVIDES ANOTHER AVENUE OF SUPPORT- FOR SOME OF THESE WORKERS YOU KNOW GIVEN THE OBSTACLES THAT THEY'RE FACING IN THIS ENVIRONMENT- BUT WHEN IT COME SECIFICALLY CARE QUESTIONS ALTERNATE OFFERED AT CHRIS **** WITH REGARD TO ENFORCEMENT. GREAT THANK YOU AT CHRIS COOK WHAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND AS YOU KNOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATION DOES HAVE- PROPOSALS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT DOES- PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR ENFORCEMENT- AS WE'VE SAID WITH ALL OF OUR GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS WERE GOING TO BE CONTINUING TO WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT THOSE- DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SHARE IT WITH REGARDS TO THE APPROACH ON EIGHTY FIVE BUT DEFINITELY LOOKING AT THAT AS SOMETHING AS PART OF A MAJOR REVISION AS M. AND- CONSIDERING- RE LOOKING AT- THE EIGHTY FIVE CONVERSATION BUT NOTHING ADDITIONAL SHARE AT THIS TIME. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO- HOPEFULLY THE- YOU KNOW WE'RE ON A SHORTENED LEGISLATIVE CALENDAR FOR THIS YEAR WE'RE GONNA BE FOCUSING ON THE THINGS THAT ARE EITHER CORONAVIRUS RELATED OR ARE CRITICALLY URGENT FOR A CALIFORNIA'S- ECONOMY IN GETTING OUR US THROUGH THE SITUATION AND- I DON'T THINK I'M ALONE IN SAYING THAT FIXING SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT ABOUT AN IDENTIFIED WITH AB FIVE- IS ON THAT SHORT LIST OF THINGS TO DO AND I THINK THAT THERE IS. YOU KNOW BIPARTISAN BICAMERAL SUPPORT FOR ADDRESSING SOME OF THOSE ISSUES THIS YEAR I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE DO THAT. AS CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES START TO EMERGE FROM THIS CRISIS SO IT'S SOMETHING I'M HOPEFUL TO BE WORKING WITH MY COLLEAGUES AND WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON. IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS TO COME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER FONG IN THE MISTER WERE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OTHER CERTAINLY NO DOUBT THAT GROWING THE ECONOMY IS THE KEY TO IMPROVING THE STATE'S FINANCIALS- A STATUS AND SITUATION. AND I WANTED TO USE. BUT THE VISUAL PAINTED- THAT THE ECONOMY AND SMALL BUSINESSES IF IT'S A SHIP WE DON'T WANT IN HERE WITH THE RECOVERY YOU WANT A LIFT THE BURDENS ON SMALL BUSINESSES AND REDUCE THE WEIGHT- THAT THE STATE CALIFORNIA'S PLACING WITH HIM. SO AS MANY INDUSTRIES ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP THEIR BUSINESS THE FLOAT- TO QUESTION TO THE DEPARTMENT FINANCED WITH ADMINISTRATION BE WILLING TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND- ANY NEW NON A NON COATED NINETEEN RELATED REGULATIONS IN ORDER TO GIVE BUSINESSES AN OPPORTUNITY TO REBOUND. THERE OKAY WE'LL WE'LL SKIP THAT WILL COME BACK TO THE QUESTION FOR THE ADMINISTRATION MR FONG GIVEN THE QUESTIONS- CABLE ARE MOVING ON TO THE LA- IS THERE PRESIDENT'S FOR PAUSING TO REGULATIONS TO ALLOW THE ECONOMY TO REBOUND. THE BILL IS THE LA OKAY. RIGHT HELLO HELLO SO WE HAVE CONNECTION OR A. OKAY WELL WHICH SOLD OFF WANT TO YEAH. NO GET HIS WAY BACK. YEAH WHICH IS THE- SIT TIGHT FOR A SECOND. IT. YEAH. RIGHT RIGHT THE QUESTION YOUR I CAN I CAN I GET A REPEATED. OUTDOORS HAPPY TO REPEAT. I DIDN'T BREAK I AM BREAKING. THERE ARE. ALL I KNOW IS YOU WERE TALKING WITH. RICHARD SHERMAN BUT YOU KNOW. I'M GONNA FINANCE. THE REST. DIPLOMA FINANCING HERE YOU WANT TO SAY YES. SEVEN AS WE CAN HERE YEAH. SO JUST REPEAT THE QUESTION I JUST IN CASE IT WASN'T HER- THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT GROWING THE ECONOMY IS KEY TO IMPROVING THE STATE'S FINANCIAL SITUATION AND- TO USE THE ANALOGY THAT WAS PRESENTED IF GIVE THE ECONOMY OF CALIFORNIA AND SMALL BUSINESSES ARE SHIP TRYING TO STAY AFLOAT- WE DON'T WANT TO INHIBIT THEIR RECOVERY HE WON A LIFT AS MUCH BURDENS ON THEM AS POSSIBLE AND REDUCE THE WEIGHT SO WITH THEM SO MANY INDUSTRIES STRUGGLING TO KEEP THEIR BUSINESSES OF FLOAT. AND SAME BUSINESS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION BE WILLING TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND ANY NEW NON COATED NINETEEN RELATED REGULATIONS IN ORDER TO GIVE SMALL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA AN OPPORTUNITY TO REBOUND. HI MISTER FUNG RESIDENT EIGHT MISS WENT OFF AND I THINK WE ARE DEFINITELY TAKING A LOOK AT REGULATIONS AND YOU KNOW SOME OF OUR DEPARTMENTS ARE SPECIFICALLY ENGAGED- WITH THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY WORK WITH OR THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT THEY WORK WITH. ON HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON WHAT IS MOST ESSENTIAL RIGHT NOW AND THAT WE DON'T DO ANYTHING THAT WILL UNNECESSARILY. AND KEEP THE RECOVERY OUT WE DON'T NECESSARILY FEEL THAT A BLANKET- REMOVAL OR PAUSE AND ALL REGULATIONS IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD HERE- GIVING HOW COMPLICATED THE SITUATION IS- BUT- IT'S DEFINITELY THE CASE THAT WE ARE LOOKING TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE THE RECOVERY A SPLIT AS POSSIBLE GIVEN THE CHALLENGES THAT WORK. CAN I. WAIT. WITH SO MUCH I HAVE BEEN THERE ART OR NO. SURE ABSOLUTELY. HI AS CHAIRMAN I YOU KNOW I HE I'M HEARING A LOT OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT SMALL BUSINESS AND OF COURSE WE SHARE THEM I JUST WANT TO. ALL BUSINESS IN OPENING WILL RELY ON CONSUMERS WILL RELY ON PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY PURCHASE AT EAT OUT. AND IF WORKERS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE NOT GUARANTEED CERTAIN PROTECTIONS- INCOME THE ABILITY TO TAKE TIME OFF WHEN THEY'RE SICK THE ABILITY TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CONSUME AND SO I THINK IT'S CRITICAL TO NOT- YES WE NEED TO LIFT ALL BOATS BUT THOSE BOATS HAVE TO INCLUDE WORKERS AND PROTECTIONS FOR WORKERS NOT JUST MOTHER. IS OTHERWISE THE SMALL BUSINESSES WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SURVIVE WITHOUT CONSUMERS WHO CAN ACTUALLY THAT HAVE THE WHERE WITH ALL TO ACTUALLY SPEND ON TO ITS A CRITICAL THAT WE ARE NOT ONLY PROTECTING SMALL BUSINESS AND LOOKING AT WHAT REGULATIONS WE CAN- SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESS WITH BUT ALSO NOT TAKING AWAY ALL PROTECTIONS FOR WORKERS AT THE SAME TIME. WHO WILL NEED PROTECTION IS TO BE ABLE TO SURVIVE THRIVE FEED THEIR FAMILIES AND CONSUME SO I IS SO I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT THAT THAT'S WHY THE QUESTION WAS SPECIFIC TO PAUSING ANY NEW NON COVE EIGHT NINETEEN RELATED REGULATIONS SO FOR EXAMPLE- BLARING ON REGULATIONS FROM CARP ON OUR PORTS- LAYERING ON. REGULATIONS ON OP OF OUR TRUCKING INDUSTRY THAT MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT LAYERING MORE REGULATIONS ARE AND THEY HELP MORE CHEESE COMPANY THAT'S ACTUALLY TRYING TO PRODUCE CHEESE AND FOOD PRODUCTS FOR CALIFORNIANS DURING THIS CRITICAL TIME. IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO ME THAT WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THESE SMALL BUSINESSES CAN GROW THAT THEY CAN EXPAND THEY CAN RE HIGHER CALIFORNIANS SO THAT THEY CAN- THAT THEY CAN BEGIN TO PARTICIPATE AND ACTUALLY GENERATE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. ON A SIMILAR NOTE THE GOVERNMENT IS ALSO TAKING US A MEASURES PROVIDE CRITICAL ASSISTANCE TO SMALL BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUALS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW WOULD IT BE ADVISABLE AND WITH ADMINISTRATION AND THIS IS QUESTIONS THE PALMER FINANCES WELL. CREATE A MORATORIUM ON NEW TAXES AND FEES SO THAT WE AREN'T ACTUALLY TAXING THE FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE RECEIVING RELIEF RIGHT. MR FOG ON THE QUESTION OF THAT THAT TAXES AND FEES- GENERALLY- AS YOU KNOW WE DON'T THAT TAXES OR FEES UNDER PROP TWENTY SIX REQUIRE- THAT. THE LEGISLATURE SO THE GOVERNOR'S FINALIZING THAT AT THE SCHOOL PLAN IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS SO I DON'T WANT TO. GET AHEAD OF ANY DECISIONS THAT HE MAY MAKE- BUT WHEN IT COMES TO ANY NEW TAXES OR FEES THAT FALL UNDER PROP TWENTY SIX- DOES GENERALLY WILL NOT GO FORWARD WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL. SO THE GOVERNOR IS CONTEMPLATING A MORATORIUM ON TAXES AND FEES BROADLY OR JUST FOR THAT SPECIFIC. YEAH I WOULD NOT SAY THE GOVERNOR'S CONTEMPLATING A MORATORIUM I THINK I ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT THE GOVERNOR IS WORKING ON THE NAY REVISION BUDGET- AND WHEN IT COMES TO NEW TAXES AND FEES- THOSE GENERALLY ARE ENACTED FOR THE LEGISLATURE. SO THE GOVERNOR IS IN AN AS IS LOOKING AT SOME MEMBERS WERE RELIEF AND SOME ON AND SOME SOME MORE AND MORE TOWARD A MONTH SOME TAXES AND FEES. THE WORD MORATORIUM I. RESERVE WHATEVER'S IN AND IF YOU WANT TO USE. OR TO THE YEAH NOW THE GOVERNOR'S FOCUS THAT DIRECTLY- YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE NAY REVISION pTHE LAST COUPLE WEEKS. HAS REALLY BEEN ON PROVIDING EMERGENCY AND URGENT RELEASED AYE TO THAT HE PAUL IN A SMALL BUSINESSES AND THE ENTITIES THAT NEED IT MOST AND SO. SOME OF THE MEASURES YOU SEEN THEIR BAN ON FOR EXAMPLE SALES TAX FOR SMALL BUSINESS DAYS OF A CERTAIN SIZE- REVENUE. THEY CAN ADD MAKE THEIR PAYMENTS OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS RATHER THAN HAVING SALES TAX ALL AT ONCE THAT PROVIDES SOME REGULATORY RELIEF. I IN ADDITION FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AS WITH INDIVIDUALS- THE FILING DEADLINE FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TAXES I WAS MOVED FROM APRIL FIFTEENTH TO JULY FIFTEENTH AND YOU KNOW WE ARE CERTAINLY WORKING ON OUR OWN CASH FLOW TO ACCOMMODATE THAT. I KNOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE AS WELL SO THESE ARE THE TEMPORARY EMERGENCY TYPES OF MEASURES THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS CONTEMPLATED AND ALSO WORKING WITH LENDERS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE PROVIDING RELIEF TO THAT AT THE DEBTORS ARE NOT MET THEY HAVE AS WELL- BUT WHEN IT COMES TO BUY NEW TAXES OR NEW FEES. I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING THERE IS THAT ULTIMATELY. THAT BY JUST WHAT WE ARE A THE IN. IS IN THE. REALLY WE CAN ADD TO GET. YOU KNOW THE OF THIS EMERGENCY RIGHT OUR- WHILE AT THE SAME. LOOK TO ENGAGE WITH YOU. ON THE NAY RIDLEY AND A BY WHICH AS MISS CAN MATCH THAT THE STAR OF THIS YEAR I. THE STILL THE PLAN YOU ARE PROPOSED THAT BOUNCE BUDGET ON A FOURTEEN. AND FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ENACT A BALANCED BUDGET ON JUNE FIFTEENTH IN ANY TAXES OR REVENUE DECISIONS I WILL BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF THAT BY THE LEGISLATURE. SO WHAT I BY I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE ANSWER IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. TO ME THAT AT A TIME WHEN SMALL BUSINESSES AND FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA OR STRUGGLING. AND THAT WE WANT TO BURDEN THEM WITH WITH ANY. ADDITIONAL BURDENS WHETHER IT'S A NEW TAXES NEW FEES OR NEW REGULATIONS- IN TERMS OF THAT QUESTION TO THE LA. IS THERE PRESIDENT'S. TO DOING AN EXTENSIVE REVIEW AT LOOKING FOR AREAS WHERE WE CAN. TEMPORARILY PIES- ANY NEW REGULATIONS ARE NON COVERED RELATED- ANY- APOLOGIZE TO ADD TO PROVIDE REGULATORY RELIEF AT OR TO YOU- PAS TAXES AND FEES TO ALLOW. BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA TO REBOUND. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ON IT IT'S A GOOD QUESTION IT'S ACTUALLY ONE OUR OFFICE IS ALSO BEEN IN SOME DISCUSSIONS WITH BEHIND THE SCENES HERE AS WE- GET READY FOR THE COMING THAT. YOU WERE MY COLLEAGUE CAROL AND YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO ADD SOME OF THE SENATE DID WELL. COMMENTS ON THIS TOPIC MORNING CAROLINE CHEER FROM THE LA SHOW YES SO BACK TO YOUR QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG I DON'T KNOW IF IN PAST RECESSIONS THE STATE NECESSARILY- TOOK A FOR ITS JUST SIMPLY BECAUSE REGULATIONS AS YOU KNOW REGULATIONS ARE ARE DERIVED FROM STATE STATUTE- THAT OUR GOVERNING BY THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS THAT SAID THEY'RE LIKELY ARE SOME REGULATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE ENVISIONED FOR FORGET OF A DIFFERENT WORLD AND THAT THE- MISTER PICKS POINT WE WILL LIKELY IN THE LEGISLATURE LIKELY MAY WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER THERE ARE SOME THAT- EITHER COULD BE TEMPORARILY. CAUSED OR STEPPED BACK IN ORDER TO FACILITATE ECONOMIC RE OPENING AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT- WHAT THOSE POTENTIALLY COULD BE- AND NOT NECESSARILY JUST NEW REGULATIONS BUT IT EXISTING ONES AS WELL. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH I JUST WELL WHY TO IMPLORE THE MINISTRATION INTO THE LEGISLATURE THAT THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH. THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO TO ASSIST IN GETTING OUR FINANCIAL HOUSE IN ORDER CERTAINLY THERE ARE DIFFICULT DECISIONS TO BE LAID TO BE MADE- MOVING FORWARD BUT ULTIMATELY IT'S GOING TO BE. THE INNOVATORS DUTCH ADORES SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS- IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S GOING TO GET OUR OUR ECONOMIC ENGINE GOING AND OUR ECONOMIC HEALTH IN A IN A BETTER SITUATION SO IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS LAWMAKERS HAD TO CREATE A SMOOTH OF A PATH A PATH AS POSSIBLE FOR THEM. INTO NOT TO LAYER ON AND BIRD IN AN ALREADY SINKING BOAT THAT IS TAKING ON WATER THANK YOU VERY MUCH PUSH IT THANK YOU BEFORE YOU GO TO MISTER GRAY UNTIL- PROFESSOR AT JAIRAM AN NEEDED TO LEAVE AT NOON ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS. FOR HER I WAS GONNA MOVE THOSE UP IF ANYBODY HAS ANY QUESTIONS FOR HER. OKAY THANK YOU SCOTT DUNCAN'S CORRECT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAN THANK YOU TO OUR PANELISTS APPRECIATE YOUR EXPERTISE YOUR PRESENTATION HERE THIS AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU CHAIRMAN TING FOR PUTTING THIS HEARING TOGETHER I THINK AS WE TURN OUR EYES TO- DEPENDING- NEED FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY INVESTMENTS- AND FOSTERING ECONOMIC GROWTH IT'S GREAT TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIT WITH MY COLLEAGUES AND INTO THIS ISSUE. I WANT TO START. FOLLOWING UP ON SEVERAL MY COLLEAGUES WHO BROUGHT UP. THIS NOTION OF REDUCING BARRIERS REDUCING REGULATION I WANT TO THANK. DAVE BOLLAND WHOSE BOTH A CONSTITUENT AND- RUNS A GREAT. BUSINESS IN MY DISTRICT THAT EMPLOYS A LOT OF PEOPLE- AND CONTRIBUTES A WHOLE LOT NOT JUST CALIFORNIA BUT THROUGHOUT THE NATION. IT STRUCK ME AND I DON'T KNOW THAT I SEE THINGS EXACTLY THE SAME AS MY COLLEAGUE MISTER FONG BUT I DO THINK WHETHER IT'S A BLANKET- RELAXATION OF NEW REGULATION- AND FRANKLY- NEW LITIGATION AS WELL YOU KNOW WE BECOME- CHANGES- WITH TOO MUCH REGULATION CALIFORNIA AND- WHILE I APPRECIATE. THE COMMENTS. REGARDING BOTH THE EMPLOYER AND THE EMPLOYEE AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE STRESS BOTH I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM TO RELAX- OF- REGULATIONS AND CERTAINLY HALL NEW REGULATIONS LOT AREAS THAT AREN'T CAN ADVERSELY IMPACT BUT RATHER WOULD HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON BOTH EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES AND- JUST IN OUR NECK OF THE WOODS I KNOW MR FONG SHARES MANY OF THESE INDUSTRIES AND IN HIS BACKYARD- THE AIRBOARD THE WATER BOARD YOU KNOW CURRENTLY THE WATER BOARDS LOOKING AT- EXPANSIONS OF THE- PHASE TWO BAY DELTA THAT HAVE HUGE CONSEQUENCES. THESE ARE THE KIND OF THINGS THAT HAVE NO URGENT NEED RIGHT NOW AND I WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST THE GOVERNOR CONSIDER- HALTING SOME OF THOSE ACTIVITIES TELL WILL GET THROUGH THIS ECONOMIC CRISIS YEAH I'VE SEEN. SEVERAL OPINION PIECES THROUGHOUT PUBLICATIONS HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE COUNTRY TALKING ABOUT THE GAMES WE'VE MADE. ENVIRONMENTALLY DURING THIS CRISIS THAT SOME OF THE SLOWDOWN ACTIVITY HAS ACTUALLY HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT AND I KNOW. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE MY DISTRICT. IS WE CONTINUE TO. PRODUCE FOOD WE HAVE ESSENTIAL WORKERS WE CONTINUE TO. MOVE THAT FOOD ACROSS THE STATE ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND YET ARE THERE IS MUCH CLEANER WHICH CERTAINLY. BEGS THE QUESTION THOSE THAT HAVE. LAY IN THE AIR QUALITY ISSUES AT THE DOORSTEP OF AGRICULTURE AND ARE REAL COMMUNITIES- MAY HAVE BEEN- MISINFORMED OR MAY HAVE INTENTIONS THAT WE NEED TO TAKE. ANOTHER LOOK AT POST THIS CRISIS. I'D LIKE TO GOVERNOR TO CONSIDER REGULATORY EXPANSION- HOLIDAY BUT MAYBE MORE APPROPRIATELY- TO RESPOND FROM THE FINEST COME TO ME WE NEED A TASK FORCE THAT IS- BIPARTISAN BICAMERAL- INCLUDE ADMINISTRATION TO LOOK AT VERY SPECIFIC TARGETED. REGULATORY RELIEF- BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS AN EXCEPTIONAL POINT MAY WE DON'T WANT TO. INCREASE THE WEIGHT ON OUR SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE. SO IT'S VERY COMMON THAT I WANT TO ASK YOU TO COMMENT FURTHER I'D LIKE TO MOVE TO SMALL BUSINESS LENDING AND FIND OUT WHAT IDEAS DEPARTMENT FINANCE AS IT HAS BEEN EXTORTED FRUSTRATION- IN MY DISTRICT I'M SURE THROUGHOUT MY COLLEAGUES DISTRICTS TO SEE SMALL BUSINESSES- ARE DENIED THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET THE LINES OF CREDIT THAT THEY NEED. TO GET THROUGH THIS VERY DIFFICULT TIME AND FRANKLY I THINK SOME OF OUR BANKS. HAVE DONE A VERY POOR JOB- AND I REALIZE WE HAVE SOME LIMITATIONS TO WHAT THE FEDS AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STATE REGULATE AS A GHOST BANKS I KNOW WE HAVE OUR BANKING CHAIR HERE TODAY PARTICIPATING THIS HEARING AND I WOULD STRONGLY ENCOURAGE HER TO TAKE A GOOD LOOK. AT WHAT ACTIONS CALIFORNIA CAN TAKE TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING THE LINES OF CREDIT- TO MAKE IT THROUGH THIS DIFFICULT TIME JUST FINANCE HAVE ANY COMMENT ON THAT ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PLANS GOING INTO THIS BUDGET. YES THANK YOU THROUGHOUT SAY VERY BRIEFLY NUMBER WHY AND- I THINK THAT SITUATION THAT. WE HAVE SEEN-WITH SOME OF THE ISSUES WITH THE PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR WHICH IS I THINK. WHAT YOU WERE REFERRING TO AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL- GOVERNOR'S MAKE CLEAR THAT- THOSE ISSUES ARE UNACCEPTABLE THEY NEED TO BE FIXED. AND WHAT WE SAW IN THE BILL THAT PASSED THIS LAST WEEK WAS MAKING SURE THAT SOME OF THOSE ASSETS AT NEW WE PROVIDED. BY CONGRESS WILL BE CARVED OUT A SPECIFICALLY FOR SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T REALLY GET THE ACCESS THAT THEY WERE ENTITLED TO. THE FIRST TIME- SO THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES BUT WHEN IT COMES TO SOME OF THE ISSUES OTHER ISSUES IN THE PROGRAM. CONGRESS HAS AFFECTS ALL OF THEM SO I THINK BAG GOVERNOR HAS CERTAINLY CALLED FOR MAKING SURE. THAT EVERYBODY HAS ACCESS TO THIS PROGRAM IT'S NOT PRIVILEGING. THE LARGEST LENDERS AND I'M A I'M SORRY THE LARGEST BORROWERS ARE THE MOST WELL CONNECTED BUSINESS AS BUT THAT ALL. SMALL BUSINESSES CAN AND ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM AND IN PARTICULAR I THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS IS A LOT OF. NAMING AND SHAMING AROUND SOME OF THOSE BUSINESSES AND THAT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO MAKING SURE. THAT SOMEBODY'S LARGER MORE WELL KNOWN BUSINESSES ARE EXPLAINING THE PROGRAM. BUT I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IS A MORE SYSTEMATIC ISSUE THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS MADE VERY CLEAR- NEEDS TO BE FIXED. I THINK SECOND WHEN IT COMES TO THE STATE WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ON BASE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. IN MAKING SURE MORE AND MORE BORROWER IS A REALLY DO NEED THAT ASSISTANCE HAVE ACCESS TO THAT PROGRAMS. AND THEN FINALLY- AS YOU KNOW WE DID HAVE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO CALIFORNIA FOR STRUCTURE INVOLVING BANKS ALSO KNOWN AS THE AYE BANK I SPECIFICALLY FOR THOSE ENTITIES THAT FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ELIGIBLE OR AND I COULD EASILY ACCESS SOME OF THE OTHER EIGHT INCLUDING THE FEDERAL AID. THAT WAS MENTIONED SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE TOOLS THAT WERE WORKING ON AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE DOING MORE ON THIS YOU KNOW LOOKING FOR THE NAY REVISION PROCESS THAT WHAT MORE. WE CAN DO- AND THEN AS YOU KNOW AND WE HAD A BRIEF DISCUSSION LAST WEEK ABOUT THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY TASK FORCE THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS STOOD OUT. THERE GOING TO BE FOCUSED. VERY MUCH ON THIS ISSUE. AS WELL SO SOME OF OUR TOOLS ARE. IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE OF THE DOWN. BUDGET REQUIREMENT WE WERE DISCUSSING. BUT CERTAINLY WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S ACCESS- PUSHING OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS TO DO MORE AT THE GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION REALLY COMMITTED TO DOING EVERY. WELL MAKE SURE THAT I DOUBLE DOWN ON MY COMMENTS THAT WE HOLD THESE INSTITUTIONS ACCOUNTABLE I KNOW MY DISTRICT SOME OF THE SMALLER COMMUNITY BANKS. SEEM TO HAVE NO PROBLEM GETTING LINES CURVED OUT TO THEIR CUSTOMERS WHILE THE LARGER NATIONAL BANKS-SEEM TO OR APPEAR TO. BE DRAGGING THEIR FEET IN SOME INSTANCES- IN A VERY UNACCEPTABLE WAY AND I HOPE- BOTH THE GOVERNOR. AND THE STATE LEGISLATURE HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. FOR ANY ACTIVITY. RESEMBLING THAT. AND I WANT TO REITERATE I HOPE THAT WE CAN WORK. WITH ADMINISTRATION WITH FINANCE AND OTHERS TO EXPLORE WAYS THAT WE CAN. PUT A TEMPORARY- EASE OF WATER BOARD AIRBOARD IT CETERA- IMPLEMENTATIONS ON NEW REGULATIONS THAT ARE COSTLY. AND DIFFICULT SO THAT WE CAN AT LEAST ALLOW THOSE BUSINESSES STILL FLOAT TO CONTINUE TO REMAIN FLOAT. I WANT TO MOVE NOW TO. STANDING ON THE SOCIAL WORKER NATURE OF MY DISTRICT WHILE MANY CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN SHELTER IN PLACE MAYBE THE PEOPLE I REPRESENT CONTINUE TO PRODUCE FOOD- AND TO DO THE CRITICAL WORK THAT ALLOWS ALL OF YOU AND YOUR DISTRICTS TO HAVE A- RELIABLE AFFORDABLE FOOD SOURCE. THAT INVOLVES TRACKING THAT FOOD UP AND DOWN CALIFORNIA AND- IT IS TRAGIC THAT THOSE VERY WORKERS LIVING COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE ROBUST HEALTH CARE INFRASTRUCTURE AND WORKFORCE. TO PUT THAT VERY REAL TERMS IN SAN FRANCISCO SITTING CARRY THEIR FOUR HUNDRED ELEVEN PHYSICIANS PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. IN MERCED COUNTY WHERE I LIVE THERE ARE NINETY ONE POSITIONS PER ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE NOW THAT SHORTAGE IS- PLAYING ITSELF OUT VERY DANGEROUS WAYS DURING THIS- VERY- PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS I JUST RECEIVED A LETTER FROM A PEDIATRICIAN MY DISTRICT THE OTHER DAY DOCTOR SAUDI. WHO WAS HIGHLIGHTING THE VERY REAL CONCERNS OF POSITIONS- ON THE FRONT LINES. UNDERSTAFFED IN THESE RURAL COMMUNITIES- LOOKING FOR ANY HELP- THE LEGISLATURE CAN PROVIDE. MY COLLEAGUE DR REGULAR EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON MADE SOME MENTION OF- MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT AND THE NEED TO INCREASE THOSE RATES ARE COMPARABLE TO WHAT WE SEE- IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM- AS A WAY OF ECONOMIC STIMULUS AND I FULLY SUPPORT THAT I HOPE THE GOVERNOR- PUTS THAT AT THE TOP. OF HIS PRIORITY LIST AS WE LOOK TO ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND LOOK TO STABILIZE OUR HEALTH CARE INFRASTRUCTURE WORK FORCE. NOW WE'RE GOING TO ENTER IN VERY DIFFICULT BUDGET YEAR- IN IT MAY BE VERY DIFFICULT BUDGETING SEVERAL YEARS. BUT I'D LIKE TO CALL ON BOTH THE STATE LEGISLATURE IN ADMINISTRATION TO. LOOK TOWARDS A BLUE NEW DEAL. WHERE WE MAKE MAJOR INVESTMENTS IN NEW MEDICAL SCHOOLS NURSING PROGRAMS NURSE PRACTITIONERS LOAN REPAYMENT RESIDENCY SLOTS THINGS THAT HAVE FOR TOO LONG. BEEN IGNORED AND VERY MUCH TO OUR DETRIMENT AS WE STRUGGLE TO HAVE THE CAPACITY DURING THIS WORLD EVENT THAT WE'RE FACING WITH COVERT NINETEEN. JUST A FINANCE HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO PUT THE GOVERNOR'S DESK CONSISTENT WITH MY VISION FOR A NEW BLUE DEAL. A BLUE NEW DEAL RATHER THAT. WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THOSE NESTOR INVESTMENTS I KNOW THE JANUARY BUDGET FOR EXAMPLE HAD MONEY IN IT FOR THE MED SCHOOL- IN THE VALLEY WANT TO SEE THAT CONTINUE BUT I THINK WHAT'S APPROPRIATE EVEN A BIGGER EXPANSION AGAIN I REALIZE THE DOLLARS ARE GOING TO BE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN. ALTHOUGH THAT MEANS WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE- EVEN MORE THOSE THAT PRECIOUS RESOURCE IN THOSE FINANCES SO FINANCED YOU HAVE ANY PLANS AS A RATES AS RELATES TO- MAKING- INVESTMENTS IN THOSE AREAS. VERY BRIEFLY AND THEN MY COLLEAGUE ADAM DORSEY ON THE LINE AS WELL I THINK YOU REALLY. DESCRIBE THE TRADE OFFS. YEAH ACTUALLY THERE WHICH IS THAT. WE HAD TO ADD SOME OF THESE COMMITMENTS THAT WE WERE VERY EXCITED ABOUT BECAUSE THEY'RE SO IMPORTANT IN THE JANUARY BUDGET. AND NOW WE DON'T KNOW- IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THAT WELL WE KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO ARE DOLLARS THAT. WE HAD IN JANUARY SO WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO YOU KNOW. PUT OUT A REVISED BUDGET THAT WILL HAVE CUTS BUT- MAKING SURE THAT WE REDUCE THE IMPACT TO MINIMIZE IT ON THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS SO. SOME OF THESE INVESTMENTS AND HELP- ARE CERTAINLY. AT THE TOP OF OUR WESTERN THINKING THROUGH HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE GIVEN THAT WE'RE IN A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE WE NEED- BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE KNOW THAT THERE'S JUST YOUR DOLLARS AVAILABLE SO I CAN'T COMMENT ON THE SPECIFIC- ITEMS THAT YOU MENTIONED REGARDING IN MEDICAL SCHOOL AND- OTHER FUNDING- EXCEPT TO SAY THAT THE GOVERNOR IS LOOKING AT ALL THAT TOGETHER. IN CONTACT AS HE THINKS ABOUT WHERE TO PUT INVESTMENTS AND REVISED BUDGET. AND OF COURSE ONCE WE PUT THAT OUT IN MAY FOURTEENTH OF THE LEGISLATURE- WILL BE AT THINKING ABOUT THEIR PRIORITIES. AS WELL AND ADAM YOU WANT TO SAY ANYMORE. YEAH I THINK IT'S YEAH. I AGREE I THINK THAT IT'S- WE MADE SOME HISTORIC INVESTMENTS AND IN THE BUDGET ACT LAST YEAR- WITH RESPECT TO WORK FORCE- WORKFORCE PROP THAT PROGRAMS AT THE OFFICE OF THAT. A STATEWIDE. HEALTH PLANNING DEVELOPMENT TO THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA AND YOUR MEDI CAL PROGRAM USING PROP FIFTY SIX FUNDS. AND YOU KNOW LIKE MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED THAT. I DON'T KNOW THAT. WE KNOW AT THIS POINT. TO THE EXTENT THAT THOSE THINGS CAN BE SUSTAINED ON GOING- INCREASED OR WHATEVER BUT I THINK THAT. WE WILL- WE WILL BENEFIT FROM THE INVESTMENTS THAT THAT HAVE BEEN MADE- OVER THE LAST YEAR SO. WE APPRECIATE RESPONSE ALTHOUGH I THINK I'M. RECOGNIZING THE FRONT END THAT WE DON'T KNOW IF THOSE THINGS CAN BE SUSTAINED WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO BE. HOW-MANY DIFFICULT BUDGET. WHAT I'M SAYING IS WE MUST SUSTAIN THOSE INVESTMENTS WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO BE SHORT SIGHTED- IN OUR HEALTH CARE SPENDING YOU KNOW FOR. THE ENTIRE TIME INSURANCE LEGISLATURE I'VE FOUGHT FOR REAL INFRASTRUCTURE WORKFORCE INVESTMENTS IN. RURAL COMMUNITIES NOT DONE THAT BECAUSE WHEN WE MADE THE PROMISE OF HEALTH CARE FOR ALL- HERE IN THIS COUNTRY WE LEFT RURAL COMMUNES BEHIND. WE MADE MAJORS EXPANSION OF INSURANCE COVERAGE PROGRAMS. WITH NO EXPANSION WORKFORCE AND WHAT THAT MEANS IN A PRACTICAL SENSE FOR PEOPLE RURAL COMMUNITIES IS NO EXPANSION WHATSOEVER AT NO ADDITIONAL HEALTHCARE AND WE'RE SEEING SOME. SOME TRAGIC TRAGIC SITUATIONS THAT WE FIND OURSELVES A PUBLIC HEALH CRISIS LACKING THOSE RESOURCES THERE FOR SEVERAL YEARS I CARRIED A BILL. RELATIVE TO MAKING SURE THAT EVERY DIABETIC ON MEDI CAL COULD RECEIVE A CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE WATER. A TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE TO EVERY PRIVATE INSURANCE PLAN- CUSTOMER- AND A YOU KNOW A QUICK BEEN AVAILABLE TO- FEDERAL MEDICARE RECIPIENTS BUT ONLY NOT AVAILABLE TO SOME OF THE POOREST CALIFORNIANS. AND INVESTMENT IN CGM WITH FOLKS HAVE DIABETES HAS INCREDIBLE LONG TERM SAVINGS AND I THINK DOES THE CAR CHOICES WE'RE GONNA BE MAKING HERE'S WHAT IS THE LONG TERM VISION AND HOW DO WE SUREUP- IN A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR FINANCE. IS IT MORE COST EFFECTIVE FOR THE STATE TO FREE UP AN EXISTING HOSPITAL BED OR PROCURING DISTRIBUTE SURGE CAPACITY BETS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THIS IS THE BANK- AND WE'VE GOT MARK OF YOUR MAKE IT JUST AS WELL I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE THAT DATA RIGHT IN FRONT OF US WE MAY HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT QUESTION. OKAY I WILL. FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON THAT. WE CAN FOLLOW UP IS THAT WHAT I HEARD. WE WANT TO AYE HSS ANOTHER PART OF OUR HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE I THINK IS TOO OFTEN. OVERLOOKED YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD HORROR STORIES OF SKILLED NURSING ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN THEIR WORK FOR STERN THIS PANDEMIC CAN ANOTHER EXTRAORDINARILY VULNERABLE GROUP. IS ISOLATED SENIORS LIVING ALONE AT HOME WHO WERE SERVED BY I. H. S. AS CARE GIVERS. I HSS PROVIDES HELP FOR SENIORS THEY CAN LIVE SAFE IN THEIR HOMES INSTEAD OF NURSING HOMES AND HOSPITALS REDUCING COSTS FOR THE STATE- I THINK WE COULD SAFELY SAY THEIR WORK NOW IS PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANT. THAN EVER. BUT YET WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A SHORTAGE OF CARE GIVERS- IN MY DISTRICT AND THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND- I THINK THAT MAY HAVE A LOT TO DO THAT MANY OF OUR PROVIDERS ARE. EARNING MINIMUM WAGE AND OFFERED NO BENEFITS SO GIVEN HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO RECRUIT MAINTAIN THIS WORKFORCE I HOPE THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PLANS ARE WILL CONSIDER- PLANS TO PERHAPS. GIVE SOME KIND OF SUPPLEMENTAL HAZARD PAGE THAT WE CAN GET THESE IMPORTANT WORKERS IN THE SENIOR HOMES- DURING THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS ANY COMMENT ON THAT FROM FINANCER OTHERS. LARA DEFINITELY TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION- AS THE GOVERNOR FINALIZES DECISIONS OVER THE COMING WEEKS OUT BUT I THINK THAT ALL NEEDS TO BE PART OF THAT BUDGET PROCESS. THANK YOU ALL LOOK FORWARD TO. FOLLOW UP IN THOSE AREAS- FINALLY IN THE AREA OF ECONOMIC COVER I WANT TO. REYES AN IDEA YOU KNOW AS WE STRUGGLE TO. RESTART AND REOPEN ECONOMY I THINK WE NEED TO TAP THE EXPERTISE OF ALL OF CALIFORNIA AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS NOBODY KNOWS HOW TO RUN THEIR REALIZATION OF THE BUSINESS- BETTER THAN THE INDIVIDUALS TO WORK EVERY DAY IN THOSE ORGANIZATIONS AND BUSINESSES. AND I THINK THE GOVERNOR ADMINSTRATION LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER- CALLING UPON THAT EXPERTISE A CALL TO ACTION- THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA TO DEVELOP PLANS TO SAFELY WHEREVER WE ALL REALIZE THAT COVERT IS GOING TO BE AN EXTENDED- CHALLENGE AT SOME LEVEL AND I THINK THE IDEA OF A- SILVER BALL IT- SOLUTION OR A- OR A DAY IN THE NEAR FUTURE WE'RE WE'RE JUST GONNA BE OPEN A BACK TO BUSINESS AS USUAL IS- IS MISPLACED. AND WE NEED TO PLAN FOR THE LONG TERM I THINK WE SHOULD ENGAGE ALL CALIFORNIA'S IN THAT PLANNING A PERHAPS SOME TYPE OF PROCESS WERE SMALL BUSINESSES AND OTHERS COULD- IN GAUGE WITH THEIR LOCAL DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WITH SOME OF THE TASK FORCE THE GOVERNOR'S WORK AND I'D CERTAINLY. BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP THIS IS- A ROUGH IDEA- I'VE- SENATE A FEW PLACES IN ADMINISTRATION BUT I'D LOVE TO SEE. SOME ADDITIONAL FOLLOW UP- WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE TOPIC. A COMMENT FROM FINANCER OTHERS. YES ASSEMBLYMEMBER ALL SPEAK VERY BRIEFLY AND THEN I THINK MY COLLEAGUE MARK OF HHS BASED BECAUSE WELL I THINK IN TERMS OF HAT GENERAL APPROACH SHOT THAT YOU OUTLINED IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE FOUND VERY VALUABLE I KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO EVERYTHING FROM THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CORD THAT WAS STOOD UP IN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS TO THE CALIFORNIANS FOR ALL- CAMPAIGN YOU'RE RUN BY DR CHIEF SERVICE OFFICER JOSH FRIDAY ALONG WITH THE FIRST PARTNER- ENGAGING PEOPLE ON THE GROUND WHO ARE CLOSE TO THE ISSUE AS YOU MENTIONED. IS THE BEST WAY TO REALLY DRIVE THE IDEAS THAT CAN GIVE US SOLUTIONS- SO WHEN IT COMES TO THE BROADER ECONOMIC RECOVERY- I THINK THERE ARE MANY WAYS FOR PEOPLE TO ENGAGE AND CANDIDLY I THINK ONE OF THE BEST IS TO ENGAGE WITH ALL OF YOU BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE ARE WORKING ON A REVISION OF THE BUDGET ONLY GETS ENACTED ONCE YOU SHAPE AND APPROVE IT SO I KNOW WE'RE GONNA BE CONSTANT CONVERSATION. WITH YOU ARE HAPPY TO ALSO TAKE BACK YOUR FEEDBACK ON AYE DESCRIBING OR PUTTING TOGETHER ANY SORT OF MORE FORMAL VEHICLES ARE MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE MECHANISMS AGAINST THE BACK- TO THE POLICY MAKERS AND MARK UP YOU WANT TO ADD. THE ONLY THING I WOULD I'M ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS THAT I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AS WE LOOK AT THE SIX INDICATORS THAT THE GOVERNOR OUTLINED AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF. THIS BUILDING OUT THOSE SIX INDICATORS AND DELIVERING ON THE STATE'S INTEREST IS BOTH OUR ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS ON A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY SERVICES SITE BUT ALSO WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR MORE GENERALLY INDICATOR FIVE IN PARTICULAR IS AROUND LOOKING AT- THE VARIOUS SECTORS OF OUR ECONOMY AND I THINK THAT IS AN AREA WHERE WE ARE REALLY LOOKING TO ENGAGE WITH- I WRITE YOU DIFFERENT ENTITIES REALLY HELPED SHAPE. OUR THINKING ON THOSE ASPECTS MORE BURKE AS WE BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT IS THAT THE POINT THAT I ALLUDED TO EARLIER AS WE BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS TO VARIOUS SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY SO THAT THEY CAN SAFELY OF BEGIN THE RE OPENING PROCESS IT'S GONNA BE VERY OF OUR PRICE TO ENGAGE WITH AND WHY OUR. GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS TO HELP INFORM RIGHT THINKING AROUND. HOW THERE WAS AND START MEANS REALLY LOOK LIKE. AT IT'S ESSENTIAL. HOW DO YOU DO CENTER CHECKER WE DO NEED TO DO SOME. I HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DELIVER AN PHYSICAL. CALL FROM. WORKER SIDE BUT ALSO FROM A CONSUMER SIDE RECORD. SITE SOMEONE WAS INTO A- PARTICULAR BUSINESS. AND THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED A CONTEMPLATING AND I THINK YOU POINTED OUT VERY WELL. THAT LIFE. IS LIKELY NOT GET AT. IT AS WE MODIFIED THE STATE IN ORDER THINGS ARE NOT GOING TO. IMMEDIATELY GO BACK TO HOW THEY WERE IT'S GONNA TAKE SOME TIME FOR US TO GETTO THAT POINT. AND IT'S GOING TO BE ON ALL OF US TO THINK ABOUT. I WHAT WE CAN DO TO CONTRIBUTE BACK IT CERTAINLY. THERE ARE PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERS HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY BUT WE AND- AND CALIFORNIA CITIZENS TO HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY IN THAT AND SO. I THINK I'LL BE UPON ALL OF US TO THINK ABOUT. HOW WE ARE IN DANGER. I APPRECIATE. YOU SPENDING SOME TIME DIG INTO THAT. I MENTIONED LAST MONDAY- IN OUR PREVIOUS OVERSIGHT HEARING THAT- MYSELF IN THE SPEAKER HAD AUTHORED A LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR- REGARD THE TASK FORCES ARE GETTING LEGISLATIVE ENGAGEMENT AND- CHAIRMAN TAKING CHAIRMAN WHAT OTHERS HAVE BEEN HEAVILY INVOLVED IN THAT. I BELIEVE WE'RE GONNA BE HAVING A TASK FORCE CONVERSATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE MINISTRATION- IN THE NEAR FUTURE HERE- IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS AND I'LL BE RAISING THESE ISSUES IN THAT TASK FORCE- AND IN THAT ENGAGEMENT WITH THE EXECUTIVE AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN DEVELOP A WAY TO BOTH CREATE SOME REGULATORY RELIEF AS WAS DISCUSSED- ENGAGE IN A BLUE NEW DEAL AS FAR AS HEALTH CARE- INVESTMENT- AND OF COURSE TAPPED THE EXPERTISE OF ALL CALIFORNIA- AS WELL AS HOLDING OUR BANKS ACCOUNTABLE SO APPRECIATE YOUR TIME HERE TODAY- AND ALL YOU'LL BACK TO CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU MISTER GREAT JUST WANT TO MAKE A NOTE AGAIN- I KNOW DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN LA- CAN STAY ON BUT ALL THE OTHER PANELISTS HAVE TO LEAVE. SO DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. MR THE MOST NEXT TO HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. FOR THE PANELISTS SAID MISSISSAUGA MISLIM ON. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND SO I WILL START ACTUALLY WITH MY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR THE OTHER PANELISTS FIRST I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE- THAT THAT TO US MR FONG- FROM SAN FRANCISCO CHAMBER OF COMMERCE TALKED ABOUT ONE HIS FIRST POINTS ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS. FOR SCHOOLS- BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC TO RE OPEN AND THAT THAT WAS AN ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THING- A FOR EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE SO MANY OF OUR PARENTS. ARE OR WORKING AND SO I HOPE THAT IN THE BUDGET SUB TO HEARING TOMORROW- WE WILL DELVE INTO THAT BUT I DON'T WANT THAT TO BE LOST IN THIS CONVERSATION HOW MANY PARENTS- ARE WORKING. AT HOME WILL STILL NEED TO WORK FROM HOME BECAUSE SCHOOLS WILL NOT BE OPEN AND I THINK IT'S PART O THAT IS RECOVERY FOR OUR BUSINESS COMMUNITY SCHOOLS HAVE TO BE PART OF THAT CRITICAL CONVERSATION SO THANK YOU FOR. FOR ADDING THAT AND IF YOU HAVE SPECIFIC THINGS TO ADD I WOULD WELCOME HEARING THOSE SINCE I'M NOT SURE YOU WILL BE ON. OUR PANEL TOMORROW AND FOR BUDGET SUB TO. IT'S MISTER FUNG SO LONGER HE'S- OKAY. SO NOT ONLY CAN HE CAN FEND THEM THEN THERE WE HAVE IT THE OTHER QUESTION THAT- I HAD WHICH WAS MORE. BROAD IN IT IT'S ACTUALLY A SOMEWHAT RELATED TO THE COMMENT- THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM MODESTO MADE WHICH IS- IT IN TIMES LIKE THIS- IT IS. SOMETIMES A CRITICAL FOR US TO LOOK AT WHAT WE COULD DO BETTER AND SO- YOU KNOW I'VE TALKED A LOT AS A CHAIR BANKING ABOUT CONSUMER PROTECTIONS- A BUT IT'S NOT LOST ON ME THAT A CONSUMER IS. EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT'S LIVING IN THE STATE AND- IT DURING THIS TIME WE HAVE HEARD FROM SMALL BUSINESSES BIG BUSINESSES- INDIVIDUALS. IT'S NOT JUST RELATED TO A LOAN OR WHAT A BANK IS IT'S RELATED TO FEES IT'S RELATED TO GETTING A HOLD OF SOMEONE- A AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW- AND PERHAPS. MISTER NICHOLS BERG CAN COMMENT THAT YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO THINK ABOUT WHAT CONSUMER PROTECTIONS WE NEED A PLACE- AND IT IS THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT FINANCE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS- HAVE NOT- TRYING TO DO SOMETHING BUT I THINK IT'S CLEAR. WHERE WE'VE MISSED THE MARK- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I KNOW- BUT AS YOU KNOW I'VE HAD COLLEAGUES FROM THROUGHOUT THE STATE THIS IS NOT EVEN A REGIONAL ISSUE FROM THROUGHOUT THE STATE. TALK ABOUT- WELL WHY CAN'T WE DO THIS WHY CAN'T WE DO THAT AND ASKING FOR MORE TO BE DE. FOR THE- CAL. THAT LOOK FOR SO SORT. SO I AM ONE IF YOU CAN. MORE BROUGH. ON THIS THAT UPPER. HIS STORE WE SEEN OUR THAT WE TAKE. IT SEE WHICH CAN AS STATE. IF ARE GO NOT TO. AT. SEC THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. I AM NOT AN EXPERT IN- IN FINANCIAL PROTECTION. FOR CONSUMERS FOR HOUSEHOLDS THE BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THAT THIS IS A- TIME IF WE SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO MAKE SOME FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES AND- AND SO ONE THING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO YOU NEED TO TALK ABOUT ALL CALIFORNIANS. THE ONE THING I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT IS THAT THIS RECOVERY IS GOING TO BE A SYMMETRIC IT'S GOING TO BE MORE RAPIDLY IN SOME SECTORS AND IT'S NOT GOING TO EXIST IN OTHERS AND I TALKED EARLIER ABOUT- THE LOW WITH EACH SECTOR OF. LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY AND RETAIL AT THE SECTORS OF BIG GOING TO BE GROWING OUR MANUFACTURING. CONSTRUCTION TECHNOLOGY AND HEALTH CARE IT IS SO I THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO. AB HELP THE WHO ARE NOT GOING TO RECOVER THEIR EMPLOYMENT IN THE DECLINING SECTORS. THE MOVIE INTO HIGHER WAGE SECTORS. IT AND- SO THAT'S NOT AN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT FINANCIAL PROTECTION- BUT JUST AN ILLUSTRATION OF HOW YOU KNOW THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT TIME BUT IT IS A TIME WHEN WE CAN REALLY THINK ABOUT. WHAT SHOULD THE STRUCTURE OF OUR INSTITUTIONS BE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE RECOVERY. THANK YOU AND NAY IF ANYBODY ELSE HAS ANYTHING TO ADD I THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SOME OF REAL CONCERN I KNOW THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT- HAS KEPT VERY BUSY AND TRYING TO IDENTIFY WHAT ROLE CALIFORNIA CAN PLAY- TO BETTER TRANSITION THE SUPPORT. AT AND NEED AND ADDRESS THE NEED FOR ALL OF OUR SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE CONSTITUENTS IN INDIVIDUALS AS WELL AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT. PART OF THIS CONVERSATION I KNOW THAT- AT ONE TIME THE ADMINISTRATION WAS LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN ENHANCE SOME OF THIS SUPPORT THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT AND I HOPE THAT- IN LIGHT OF THIS- WE DON'T NEED LESS WE NEED. OUR CONSTITUENTS NEED MORE SUPPORT- AT TO HELP THEM AND THE OTHER PIECE THAT I WANTED TO ASK YOU KNOW AND AS THE CHAIR OF THE NONPROFIT SELECT COMMITTEE IS WHAT ABOUT NONPROFIT THEY ARE A TYPE OF BUSINESS AND THEY ARE CALIFORNIA'S FOURTH. LARGEST EMPLOYER I'M IN THIS STATE SO WHAT ARE WE DOING AT TO HELP NONPROFIT AND WHAT AT CAN'T DO A I SO STAR WITH PANEL THAT NOT NOT. THE AT SEE IF IT WHEN STILL A ON THE CALL THAT CAN IN ON WE SHOULD BE THINKING OF AS A FUNCTION BILL. AND OUR COMMUNITY. AND MAYBE THERE'S NOT A LOT OF FOLKS LEFT BETTER. ON THE CALL. CAN YOU HEAR US. YEAH WE WERE WE WERE ON MUTE- SO- ENGAGING WITH NON PROFITS IS DEFINITELY AT KEY PART OF OUR STRATEGY I'LL JUST OUTLINED A COUPLE WAYS AND THAT MY COLLEAGUE MARCO AS WELL MAY WE WANT TO SPEAK I THINK THE FIRST- WHEN IT COMES TO SOME OF OUR FEDERAL ADVOCACY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE AID THAT WE GET FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- BOOK DIRECTLY TO THE STATE BUT ALSO- JUST GENERAL A THAT'S GOING OUT FROM CONGRESS. IS GOING TO NON PROFITS AS WELL AND SO I THINK IT IS WE TALKED ABOUT THE PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM ALREADY BUT WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT NON PROFITS ARE ELIGIBLE I NOT ONLY ELIGIBLE BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY GETTING THE ACCESS THAT THEY EAT WHEN IT COMES TO SPECIFICALLY TO THE STATE LEVEL I THINK WE HAVE A COUPLE OF EFFORTS AT FIRST OUT WHEN IT COMES TO SOME OF THE APPROPRIATIONS THAT MY COLLEAGUE TO RESET DESCRIBED IN THE HEARING. LAST WEEK GOT MANY OF THEM WHEN IT COMES TO THINGS LIKE SUPPORTING FOOD BANKS AND MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE GET THE SUPPORT THEY NEED- THOSE CLUBS ARE NOT PROFITS PERHAPS- ON A DIFFERENT SCALE- THE GOVERNOR'S AT SENIOR ADVISER ON SOCIAL INNOVATION KATHLEEN KELLY JANICE HAS BEEN WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WITH- YES WITH HHS I'M TRYING TO. GET AS MUCH SUPPORT AS WE CAN FROM OUTSIDE THERE IS- NON PROFITS AND OTHER COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS AND ENTITIES AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE IS NUMBER ONE STEPPING UP WITH ALL THE RESOURCES WE CAN BRING TO BEAR TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS AND MORE IMPORTANT NUMBER TO MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE COORDINATED AND I THINK YOU SAW THAT WITH THE RELIEF- THAT THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK. OR UNDOCUMENTED POPULATIONS WHO UNFORTUNATELY WERE LEFT OUT OF A LOT OF THE FEDERAL LEGISLATION THAT PASSED CONGRESS AND SO SOME OF THAT WAS A COMMITMENT OF STATE DOLLARS BUT SOME OF IT WAS ALSO. PRIVATE SECTOR NOT PROP DOLLARS AS WELL. SO MAY SURE THAT WE'RE ALL WORKING TOGETHER IS STEP. A BIG PART OF THE STRATEGY AND WERE VERY CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT. EVEN THOUGH THE AD GENERAL FUND BUDGET THAT WE'RE ALL THINKING UP FOR THE NAY REVISION AND THAT. ALL OF YOU WILL BE WEIGHING IN ON HOW IT'S ALLOCATED IN THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS AND MONTHS- THAT IS THE PRODUCT OF STATE REVENUES AND FEDERAL FUNDING. WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A STRATEGY OR YOU THAT'S INCORPORATING ALL THE ACTORS. ABLE AND PARKER THERE'S ANYTHING YOU WANT THAT YEAH I MEAN I THINK I'VE BEEN BACK- WAS. RESPONSE IN TERMS OF HOW WE ARE LEVERAGING WHETHER IT BE IN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES FACE IN PARTICULAR AYE WE ACT. PRIOR TO THIS WE HAVE ENGAGED ARE VERY. HAPPILY WORK OUR PHILANTHROPIC PARTNERS- AND WE CONTINUE TO DO THAT IN THE SPACE I THINK. MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE THE LINEMEN- AND LEVERAGING- THEIR INFORMATION AS WELL AS THEIR- ABILITY TO GET INTO THE COMMUNITY TO HELP. AYE AYES WITH REGARDS TO MESSAGING BUT ALSO HAVE. BEEN PROVIDED SPEED BACKGROUND I WE GET IT RIGHT OR IMPROVE WITH REGARDS RESPONSE ACTIVITIES IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT FACTOR. IN HOW WE DO BUSINESS SO I DIDN'T GET. I YOU KNOW I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD ON AS WE- CONTINUE WITH THIS RESPONSE. SO I WANTED. THE IN THE REMARKS AROUND THAT I THINK IT'S AN- IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT TIME WE TALK ABOUT NON PROFITS AND WE HAVE NON PROFITS LIKE A FOOD BANK O LIKE THE INDIVIDUAL HEALTH- NONPROFITS IN OUR COMMUNITY BUT ALSO KAISER IS A NONPROFIT SO THE SCOPE OF NONPROFIT THIS HUGE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- AND WHILE WE COULD TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE PARTNERSHIPS. NOT ALL ARE IN THE POSITION OF PHILANTHROPY THAT IS ONE SECTION OR ONE SECTOR OF THE NONPROFIT INDUSTRY AND SO- THERE IS STILL MUCH TO DO BECAUSE AS THE FOURTH LARGEST EMPLOYER OF THIS STATE NONPROFITS NOT BEING ABLE TO. KEEP FOLKS EMPLOYED- EIGHT IS GOING TO BE A VERY BIG ISSUE- AND THIS IS SIMILAR TO I THINK SOME OF THECOMMENTS I'VE HEARD RELATED TO THE FIFTY MILLION RELATED TO THAT I THINK. THAT THAT IS A GOOD START BUT AT AN END AND CERTAINLY THE SUPPORT THAT WE'VE GIVEN TO OUR AND DOCUMENTED- ESSENTIAL WORKERS IS AN INCREDIBLE START BUT IT'S GOING TO LEAVE HOLES THAT AND NEEDS THAT ARE AND MATT SO WHETHER IT'S A SMALL BUSINESSES THAT DIDN'T GET PPP. AT BEING ABLE OR NOT BEING ABLE TO ACCESS SOME OF THE FUNDS IN THE AYE BANK IT'S ACTUALLY NOT RELATIVELY THAT MUCH FOR THE NUMBER OF SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WE HAVE AND SO- I A THINK THAT I HOPE WE TRANSITION FROM CHECKING OFF A BOX AND ST WE DID THIS FOR THIS GROUP THIS FOR THE OTHER GROUP- TO ALSO START TO THINK ABOUT WE HAVE UNMET NEEDS AND GAPS THAT. ARE STILL NOT THERE AND WE SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED FOR BEING LEADERS AND THE FIRST- AND MAYBE THE ONLY STATE IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS DOING SOME OF THESE THINGS BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT GOING T BE ENOUGH BASED ON WHAT MEMBERS ARE SEEN WHAT PUTTING TOGETHER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- SO YOU KNOW I ADD THAT THERE AND THAT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT IS FULL RESPONSIBILITY THE ADMINISTRATION I THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE- IT SHOULD HAVE A ROLE IN SHOULD BE CHIMING IN ON HOW WE NEED SOME OF THOSE AND- IT NEEDS. BUT RECOGNIZE THAT WHILE THIS IS A GREAT STEP AND THESE ARE GREAT FIGHT FIRST AND THEY PUT CALIFORNIA THE LEAD. THERE IS STILL MORE TO DO BECAUSE WE HAVE SERIOUS UNMET NEEDS FOR ALL OF THESE COMMUNITIES- SO. I BELIEVE THAT THERE IN IN TERMS OF NON PROFITS- MY COLLEAGUE FROM MODESTO ALSO TALKED ABOUT AND THAT THE RATIO TO MEDICAL PROVIDERS IN COMMUNITIES AND SOMETIMES I THINK ON THAT- YOU KNOW ON THE- OUTER LEVEL WE DON'T THINK THAT COMMUNITIES LIKE FOR EXAMPLE MODESTO OR SANTA BARBARA MIGHT HAVE A LOT IN COMMON. BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE- IT'S HITTING COMMUNITIES VERY HARD- AND I THINK THAT THIS IDEA THAT CERTAIN COMMUNITIES- WHO MIGHT BE QUOTE UNQUOTE BETTER OFFER NOT BETTER OFF. AND YOU KNOW WHAT MIGHT BE IMPACTED IN DIFFERENT WAYS- IT TURNS OUT THAT WHEN IT COMES TO MEDICAL SERVICES AND PROVIDERS- WE HAVE REAL CONCERNS AND A LOT OF SIMILARITIES- SANTA BARBARA COUNTY DOES NOT HAVE- METROPOLITAN. URBAN AREA LIKE SOME OF THE BIG CITIES DO. AND WHEN I WATCH- COMMUNITY CLINICS LIKE SAMPSON THAT PROVIDES ONE. THIRD OF THE ENTIRE CAL ANNE'S. MEDI CAL SERVICES- THAT IS NOW FIFTEEN MILLION- INTO THEIR LINE OF CREDIT THAT IS GOING DOWN- AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SURVIVE I THINK OF THE SIMILARITIES THAT. ARE COUNTY HAS WITH COUNTIES LIKE STANISLAUS RIGHT WHERE YOU'RE LIKE WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO IF YOU DON'T HAVE INDIVIDUALS. ARE HEALTHY THEY CANNOT GO BACK TO WORK AND WE ARE WATCHING. OUR MEDICAL. AID YOU KNOW CENTERS- REALLY BE CRIPPLED AND CERTAINLY LAST YOU KNOW WEEKS ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE- SOME OF THE MEDICAL PROCEDURES AND SELECT TO US SURGERIES IS GOING TO HELP. BUT IT GOES BACK TO MY PREVIOUS COMMENT THAT WHILE WE CAN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOME OF THIS HELPS IT DOESN'T SOLVE FOR THE PROBLEM. SO I THINK I HAVE HEARD EXAMPLES ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF MEDICAL PROVIDERS WHO ARE SEEN THEMSELVES- ON THE VERGE OF GOING DOWN NOT KNOWING IF THEY WILL BE ABLE TO EXIST AND ALSO LEGISLATORS RECOGNIZING THAT WITHOUT THEM. WE CANNOT CARE FOR OUR COMMUNITY THERE IS NO WAY THAT EVERY SINGLE HOSPITAL IN THIS STATE CAN PICK UP- AND SOLVE FOR THE ABSENCE OF MEDICAL CENTERS AND OTHER MEDICAL PROVIDERS BOTH ARE CRITICALLY NEEDED. SO I'M WONDERING IF THE ADMINISTRATION CAN COMMENT ON MORE THOUGHTS BESIDES WHAT WAS DONE LAST WEEK AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WAS DONE LAST WEEK ON WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO BUT TO PROVIDE. SUPPORT TO COMMUNITIES OF ALL DIFFERENT SHAPES SIZES COLORS EVERYTHING I'M IN THE STATE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE ADAM DORSEY. I THINK- SIMILAR TO SOME OF OUR CURRENT COMMENTS THAT YOU KNOW I THINK THIS IS AN AREA WHERE THE FEDERAL RESOURCES REALLY KIND OF NEED TO BE BROUGHT TO BEAR TO STABILIZE THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND- I THINK THAT WE'VE BEEN FORTUNATE IN THAT. KERR'S ACTOR AND GAVE PROVIDE FUNDING THAT OUR PROVIDERS ARE BEING ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. AND WE LEARNED THIS MORNING OF A SECOND BATCH OF FEDERAL FUNDING THAT WAS MADE AVAILABLE- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO- DOES THE BAND IN IN THE BILLIONS- ANSWER WE BELIEVE THAT THAT. WILL REALLY IS HER TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE IN THE SHORT TERM AND REALLY. HELPING TO STABILIZE THE SYSTEM- AND SO THAT IS WHERE OUR EFFORTS ALL RIGHT NOW. AND IT WAS- TREMENDOUSLY HELPFUL- SO FOUR POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS AN OUNCE TODAY- IN ADDITION. TO SEVERAL BILLION THAT WERE ANNOUNCED- JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO. AND BUT WE ARE GOING TO LET THAT PROCESS AND KIND OF WORK THROUGH THE SYSTEM STABILIZE THE SYSTEM. AND THEN EVALUATE WHERE WE ARE FROM THERE AND JR FEDERAL PARTNERS YOU TAKES STEPS EVEN FURTHER IF YOU HELP STABILIZE THAT THE SYSTEM AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU AND I THINK THAT TO US. I'M NOT SURE THAT THE FEDERAL FUNDING LOOKING AT HEALTH PLANS- PROVIDING SELECT SERVICES AT THE THOUGHT THAT THEY THE CENTERS AND MEDICAL CENTERS WHO WRITES LIKE SERVICES- PERHAPS- YOU KNOW BANKING ON EARLY PAYMENTS FOR MEDICARE MEDIC HAL- REIMBURSEMENTSARE LINE OF CREDITS ARE GOING TO SOLVE FOR ALL OF THIS SO I IT JUST AGAIN. I WANT TO SAY THAT THERE'S NO DOUBT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT EVERYBODY IN THE ADMINISTRATION IS WORKING SO INCREDIBLY HARD- ON THIS I A THINK IT'S JUST A- I'M NOT AS CONVINCED THAT THE FEDERAL FUNDING IS GOING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM- FULLY I WISH IT WORK- BUT TO AT. A THINK WE'RE ALL GOING TO HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER INCLUDING LEGISLATORS. AND MY FINAL. QUESTION THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE CUT TOPIC THAT CAME UP LAST WEEK AND I'M WONDERING IF THE ADMINISTRATION PERHAPS HAS MORE INFORMATION- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- WITH POPULATIONS CENTS LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND- LOCAL COUNTY GOVERNMENTS WITH POPULATIONS LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND. HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE SAME LEVEL OF SUPPORT AND LOCAL- LARGER GOVERNMENTS SO WHAT CAN WE EXPECT- ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY FOR IT THESE COUNTIES- THERE ARE MANY OUT IN THE STATE. AND pAND THE COMMENT WAS MADE THAT PERHAPS- YOU FOR THE MAY REVISE WE WOULD HAVE MORE INFORMATION AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF WE DO HAVE MORE INFORMATION IN THE LAST WEEK. I'M WHAT WE CAN TELL OUR COUNTIES AND THAT DID NOT RECEIVE THIS DIRECT FUNDING. WE CONTINUE TO BE FOCUSED ON WE KNOW ESPECIALLY WITH COUNTIES- WE ARE- YOU KNOW THE STATE AND LOCALS ARE YOUR PARTNER SO CLOSELY IN TERMS OF THESE KEY. SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAMS AND THAT OF THE OVERALL FIFTEEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS. THAT WAS PART OF THE CARE IS ABSENT A CORONA VIRUS OR WE FIND AT NINE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS I WAS ALLOCATED TO THE STATE- AND THEN THE BALANCE AS YOU MENTIONED WAS ALLOCATED TO. I BELIEVE TWENTY ONE NOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COUNTIES AND CITIES. I THINK. WHAT WE AT. WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES IS THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE SPENDING THOSE DOLLARS IN A WAY THAT BENEFITS. THE WHOLE STATE SO UP UNTIL THE GOVERNOR MAKES HIS DECISIONS AND PUTS OUT HIS PROPOSAL WE CAN'T GIVE A SPECIFIC BREAKDOWN ON HOW THOSE DOLLARS WILL BE SPENT BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR HASN'T MADE THAT DECISION YET. IT'S ALSO A CHALLENGE BECAUSE WHILE WE WANT TO DO AND ARE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN HELP SUPPORT OUR LOCAL PARTNERS COUNTIES CITIES. SCHOOL DISTRICTS OTHER LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WE ALSO HAVE A HISTORIC BUDGET GAP THAT WE ARE TRYING TO CLOSE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU ON THE STATE LEVEL AND AS YOU MUCH OF A BEGINNING THERE WILL BE SOME VERY PAINFUL DECISIONS. THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE- BUT I THE GOVERNOR'S FISCAL PLAN WILL BE OUT ON MAY FOURTEENTH AND THEN I KNOW THE LEGISLATURE WILL BE WAY. THANK YOU AND I DO THINK THAT- FOR A FIFTY EIGHT STATE COUNTY- I HOPE WE DON'T LEAVE- THE COUNTIES WITH UNDER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE BEHIND- I THINK IT'S GONNA BE VERY IMPORTANT TO. DO AS BEST WE CAN TO HELP THOSE COUNTIES WHICH IS A LOT OF THEM. AND BE ABLE TO RECOVER AS WELL SO I WANT TO ADD THAT AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING. I KNOW THESE ARE TOUGH DIFFICULT QUESTIONS- AND WE AS LEGISLATORS ARE THE VOICES FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT EVERYONE IS WORKING AS HARD AS WE CAN- BUT- I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RAISE THE MORE DIFFICULT AND COMPLICATED QUESTIONS ON BEHALF OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. THANK YOU NEXT WE'RE GONNA GO TO MISTER BERLIN THE DOCTOR RIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. OF MY FIRST QUESTION IS FOR MARCO AT HHS- KIND OF FOLLOWING UP ON WHAT DOCTOR WOULD RAISE ABOUT TO PEE PEE AND AN OPENING UP THE ECONOMY- OVER THE WEEKEND I SPOKE WITH SOME EMERGENCY ROOM. PHYSICIANS AND OTHER DOCTORS AND- ONE POINT THEY BROUGHT UP WAS THAT IN OTHER EPIDEMICS- THEY INSTITUTED WHAT'S CALLED UNIVERSAL PROTECTIONS. AND WHEN THOSE UNIVERSAL PROTECTIONS. WERE IMPLEMENTED IN A PHYSICIAN OFFICES COMMERCIAL FISHING BUSINESSES RESTAURANTS COULD OPEN UP ARE YOU LOOKING ARE YOU WORKING WITH COUNTY HEALTH OFFICERS TO. IMPLEMENT ANYTHING LIKE WE DID IN THE PAST REGARDING THESE UNIVERSAL PROTECTIONS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THIS IS MARK A MAJOR THE HELPING IMAGE SERVICES AGENCY I I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH UNIVERSAL PROTECTIONS FOR SAY SO I WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU IN YOUR OFFICE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE DOING. IS WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND THE HEALTH EXECUTIVE I TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DEVELOPING GUIDANCE TOGETHER AROUND- HOW WE RE OPEN VERY SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY SO I THAT IS A CLOSE COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE STATE AND OUR COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH PARTNERS- AND I WOULD LOVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU IN YOUR SEEM TO BETTER UNDERSTAND- THIS PARTICULAR COMPONENT THAT YOU REFERENCED HERE. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MARK A LOOK FOR TO SPEAK ABOUT FURTHER ON THIS- A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR FINANCE- WE HEARD TESTIMONY THIS MORNING THAT RESTAURANT WORKERS WERE ONE POINT ONE MILLION OF THE UNEMPLOYED CALIFORNIANS- EIGHT ARE YOU LOOKING AT ANYTHING LIKE SUSPENDING THE MINIMUM WAGE- TO HELP BUSINESSES AS THEY RE OPEN OR- THE- TIP CREDIT. FOR HOURLY WORKERS OR PAYROLL TAX- WAIVER OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME IF. IF ONE POINT ONE MILLION ARE THESE RESTAURANT WORKERS- DOING THINGS LIKE THAT COULD GET THEM IMMEDIATE. IMMEDIATELY BACK TO WORK AND ACTUALLY PROBABLY A PAY RAISE AND GET THEM OFF OF UNEMPLOYMENT OR ARE YOU LOOKING AT ANY IDEAS LIKE THE- SO THIS IS THE VEGAS WHAT. THEM FROM THAT OF FINANCE- WHEN IT COMES TO THE MINIMUM WAGE- THERE'S A PROCESS OUTLINED BY LAW IN TERMS OF HOW THAT DETERMINATION IS MADE. WHETHER A MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE GOES INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY FIRST OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR- SAID THAT WILL BE DECIDED IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS I'VE HAD- SO I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING TO SHARE. ON THAT SPECIFIC QUESTION RIGHT NOW WHAT I CAN SAY IS A NUMBER ONE NOT ONLY IS- THE HELP THAT GONNA RESTAURANT WORKERS IN A RESTAURANT INDUSTRY. A PRIORITY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION BUT MORE SPECIFICALLY NUMBER TWO AND YOU KNOW MY COLLEAGUE ENDORSES ON THE LINE. AB ONE TO SPEAK WITH THIS UP THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE PROGRAM THAT THE GOVERNOR OUTLINED LAST FRIDAY WITH REGARD CHEST SENIOR MEALS WAS TO MAKE SURE. THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE AGE SIXTY FIVE AND ABOVE FOR WHAT IN A LONER MAYBE WITH ONE OTHER PERSON I BLOW A CERTAIN INCOME LEVEL I CAN GET THAT HEALTHY NUTRITIOUS MEALS IN THE SUPPORT THEY NEED AT A TIME WHEN. WE ARE ASKING PEOPLE TO STAY AT HOME- BUT A SECONDARY PURPOSE TODAY WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT HE'S RESTAURANTS AND BETTER. CAN PROVIDING THIS GOOD ARE ALSO GETTING THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO EXPAND THAT NEXT WE'RE NOT ONLY HELPING THE PEOPLE WHO NEED TO SERVICE. OR ALSOBOLSTERING THE WORKERS AND THE PEOPLE IN THE STREET SO I DID WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT PROGRAMS ON THE MINIMUM WAGE NOTHING TO SAY RIGHT NOW BUT CERTAINLY IT'S A QUESTION YET BUT YOU KNOW THAT BY WILL. BACK YOUR FEEDBACK THE ADMINISTRATION. HAS ALSO. THANK YOU YOU CAN SMALL GUIDANCE ON THAT. MY I BELIEVE SEE SIXTY A DAY FOR RESTAURANTS HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE READ OUT TO ME. THAT WAS AND BY THE GOVERNOR. THE LAST WEEK SO IF YOU COULD PROVIDE US MORE INFORMATION I'LL PEOPLE PUT COULD PARTICIPATE IN THAT. I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE THAT YES I KNOW MORE INFORMATION IS GUY WILL BE COMING IN THE COMING DAYS SO YOU KNOW WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING ON DAIS. YOU KNOW WE KNOW IT'S ENERGY I SURE AND WE ARE WE WILL BE PUSHING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THE QUESTION OR A COMMENT. OR SUGGESTION FOR LA L. THE LAST TIME WE WENT THROUGH THIS NONE OF US WERE HERE- PERHAPS. A COMMENT IF YOU IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE HISTORY. NOT RIGHT OFF THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD BUT- MAYBE YOU COULD PRODUCE A REPORT. OF WHAT ACTIONS WERE TAKEN IN. TWO THOUSAND NINE IN THE LAST CRISIS- AND MAYBE SOME ANALYSIS OF WHAT. PROGRAMS WORKED WHAT DIDN'T WOR TO HELP US AS WE MOVE FORWARD THIS YEAR WAS. MUCH OF A COMMENT ON THAT. CERTAINLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER ON WHAT. I DID AND THEN WE CAN ALSO PROVIDE SOME OF OUR PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN ANALYSIS RESPOND ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT THAT BUT THE LAST TIME WHEN THE STAGE STATE WAS FACING A LRGE FISCAL BUDGET PROBLEM. THIS SOLUTIONS COMPRISED A COMBINATION OF- INCREASE FEDERAL AID. THROUGH THE STIMULUS ACT. THIS STATE IN YOUR LIFE. INTERNAL BORROWING AND ENGAGED IN PAYMENT DEFERRALS- THOSE RESULTED AND SUBSEQUENT YOU KNOW WHAT WHEN GOVERNOR BROWN TURN THE BUT WHILE. OVER THE SUBSEQUENT YEARS IN THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY- PART OF OUR REVENUE GROWTH WENT TO PAYING DOWN SOME OF THOSE- THOSE BUDGETARY DEBTS THAT HAVE BEEN ACCUMULATED BUT IT WAS REALLY A COMBINATION OF THOSE KIND OF. ONE TIME MEASURES AND THEN OF COURSE THERE WERE ALSO SOME ONGOING REDUCTIONS TO PROGRAMS THAT THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE TIME SOME OF THEM ARE RESTORED BUT NOT ALL OF THEM AND SO- IT ONE OTHER AREA WAS THAT A RIVER. SOME REDUCTIONS IN PARTICULAR TO THE SCHOOL- K. FOURTEEN FUNDING- AND A LOT OF BILLS THAT SPEEDING SO WHERE IT SHEET THROUGH THE DEFERRAL SOME OF THE STATE PAYMENTS TO THE SCHOOLS SO. IN A WAY IT SHIFTED SOME OF THE CASH FLOW MANAGEMENT CHALLENGE. FROM THE STATE TO THE SCHOOLS. BUT I IT WAS REAL A COMBO OF AND I KNOW HAVE DONE WORK ON THEM. HAPPY TO PROVIDE THE PALACES ARE NOT THAT TO YOU GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH- ONE QUESTION OVERLOOKED FOR FINANCE. ONE INDUSTRY THAT'S REALLY BEEN STEPPING UP IN THESE TIMES IS- PRIVATE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES OFTEN MALIGNED INDUSTRY- HAVE LAUGHED AND MANUFACTURED ALL OVER THE WORLD AND I THINK IT'S PRETTY EVIDENT NOW THAT WE ARE- HELD HOSTAGE TO SOME COUNTRIES AND CAN'T GET PRODUCTS. THIS ADMINISTRATION CAN OFFER ANY INCENTIVES TO LURE THESE MANUFACTURERS OF P. PEAS AND VACCINES AND TESTING- TO COME BACK TO CALIFORNIA AND HIGHER CALIFORNIANS. HI ASSEMBLY MEMBER THIS IS MARKHAM EACH AGAIN WITH THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES SO- WE CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE ANY PARTICULAR PROPOSAL BACK NOW I MEAN I THINK WE ARE ACTIVELY CONSTANTLY ASSESSING THE SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES WITH OUR PARTNERS AT THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES- BALLS WITH REGARDS TO- THE P. P. E. S. CERTAINLY HAVE. AS WELL AS THAT THE PHARMACEUTICAL PIECES THIS IS BOTH RELATED TO DRUGS THAT ARE. AVAILABLE NOW BUT ALSO DRAGS THAT MIGHT BE IN SHORTAGE- AND THEN CERTAINLY WERE PAYING VERY CLOSE ATTENTION. TO ROWS THAT ARE HOW. AROUND A POTENTIAL TREATMENT FOR KOBE NINETEEN AND THE IMPACT THAT MIGHT HAVE AS WELL AS A VACCINE THAT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE- BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR RIGHT NOW I DID SPEAK TO THAT. OKAY THANK YOU BUT MY FINAL QUESTION IS. WELL FIRST STATEMENT THAT THE BIGGEST THE BIGGEST ISSUE IN MY DISTRICT OFFICE RIGHT NOW IS A TWO DAY- CALLS COMING IN. MAY FIRST IS COMING AND I KNOW THIS HEARING IS ABOUT LOOKING FORWARD AND HOW WE MOVE FORWARD BUT THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TAKEN CARE OF RIGHT NOW AND FRIDAYS MAY FIRST THEIR BILLS ARE DUE. HOW CAN MY OFFICE AND OTHERS GET HELP I MEAN THERE'S PEOPLE FROM APRIL EARLY APRIL THAT. THAT FILED I KNOW THEY'RE OVERWHELMED BUT- YOU KNOW MY CASE WORKER IN THE DISTRICT OFFICE CAN'T EVEN GET THROUGH TO A NEEDY PERSON- IN THE LEDGER OFFICE HOW CAN WE GET SOME HELP. FOR THE CALIFORNIA IS THAT NEED TO GET THEIR CHECKS NOW- RATHER THAN TRYING TO STABILIZE THEM IN THE FUTURE. LAKE I'LL JUST SAY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION THAT KNOWS THIS IS AN ISSUE AND IS REALLY DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN RIGHT NOW INCLUDING. A SIGNING YOU KNOW OVER A THOUSAND ADDITIONAL WORKERS FOR ET DE CALL CENTERS AND THAT THE LABOR SECRETARY JULIE STALEY HOSTED A CHAT LAST FRIDAY. EXPLAINING YOU KNOW WHAT'S IN THE ISSUES ARE AND HOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS DEALING WITH THEM SO. VERY FOCUSED ON THIS NO IT'S AN ISSUE WE ARE FACING- WE KNOW THAT THAT TECHNOLOGY CAN ALWAYS BE IMPROVED OR ALSO LIKE YOU MENTIONED JUST TRYING TO GET THROUGH THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS AND WEEKS- DEALING WITH THAT HISTORIC LEVEL OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND AT. STORK WE SHORT PERIOD OF TIME- SO DEFINITELY- WE WANT TO KEEP- HEARING THE FEEDBACK THAT YOU HAVE AND WE'RE GONNA CAN TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING. THE SUPPORT THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THANKS SO MUCH I KNOW EVERYBODY'S OVERWHELMED DURING THESE TIMES BUT- IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THESE PEOPLE TO WEEKS YOU KNOW SOME MONEY RIGHT NOW TO KEEP ON GOING. THAT CONCLUDES MY QUESTION MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR YOUR WORK. THANK YOU WERE GOING TO GO DOWN TO THE DOCTOR REGULAR AND THEN MISSED MCCARTY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- IF I CAN START WITH AGAIN I JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT INVESTMENTS IN OUR SAFETY MAN. ESPECIALLY NOW. OUR INVESTMENTS IN OUR ECONOMY. AND WE NEED TO IDENTIFY WHICH CRITICAL INVESTMENTS WE CAN SUPPORT. WHICH WILL HELP OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND THESE UNPRECEDENTED TIMES. MY FIRST QUESTION FOR THE ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO BE ABOUT ACCESS TO THE SAFETY NOT SUPPORTS. I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND IF I COULD FROM YOU. ARE PEOPLE IN FAMILIES ABLE TO ACCESS SAFETY NET PROGRAMS SUCH AS CAL WORKS AND CAL FRESH. DURING THE CRISIS. NOW THAT COUNTY OFFICES ARE CURRENTLY CLOSED. AND HOW IS THE APPLICATION. PROCESS SEES WORKING AND WHAT DOES THE VOLUME LOOK LIKE. AT THE ALTERNATE OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE ADAM DORSEY AND THEN MARCO. WELL. BARBARA FINANCE SO- YOU KNOW ONE THING I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION BEFORE HEADING UP HHS IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S COMMITMENT TO MAKING SURE WERE THAT WE WERE- YOU KNOW PREPARE JUST SORT OF HANDLE THE INFLUX OF CASES GIVEN THE PANDEMIC THAT WE'RE FACING AND SO WE DID SEND A SECTION THIRTY SIX REQUEST LEGISLATURE- THAT PROVIDED MORE FUNDS TO YOU COUNTIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN PROCESS APPLICATIONS- THE AND THAT'S REALLY TRUE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER- COUNTY OFFICES WERE OPENED AND THAT WORKERS WERE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO- TO CONTINUE TO PROCESS APPLICATIONS AS THEY CAME IN. SO THAT THAT'S BEEN A GREAT A CRITICAL STEP THAT WE'VE TAKEN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE RESOURCE HANDLE THE SITUATION- THE SHOW I DON'T KNOW IF THAT THE AGENCY HAS ANYTHING FURTHER ON THE. YOUR REGULAR THIS IS MARK ON MAJOR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY I THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND- I THINK ADAM ELABORATED ON THE COUNTY ADMINISTRATION SIDE. LET ME ALSO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE ARE DOING AROUND THEIR CONSUMER SIDE BECAUSE YOU ARE CORRECT WE ARE SEEING. AN INFLUX OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE. COMING TO THE STATE AT TAXES SERVICES AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO BE NIMBLE WHERE ARE COUNTY PARTNERS TO THE EXTENT- WE ARE ALLOWED BY FEDERAL LOT- TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE ARE. HAVING THE OPPORTUNITIES. FOR FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO SIGN UP FOR THESE PROGRAMS ARE TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE AND HOW IT WORKS AND ACT I REFERENCE THIS. IN A HEARING LAST WEEK I WE HAVE WAIVED THE FACE TO FACE REQUIREMENTS AND WE BE THAT WAY THAT WAY IT SIGNATURE REQUIREMENT BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IS A COMPLICATION. YEAH AND IT DIFFICULTY FOR FOLKS TO GET ACCESS TO THESE SERVICES AND SO WERE WANTING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS. AS ISSUES DO ARISE WE DO WANT TO PROBLEM SOLVE WITH THEM AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PUTTING THE INDIVIDUALS FOR COMING FORWARD- FIRST IN TERMS OF HOW WE DELIVER. SERVICES AND FROM WHAT. MARGOT IF I MAY. PRESENT WE WENT FROM TWO. HUNDRED CALIFORNIA APPLICATIONS LAST MONTH TO TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED. CALVET LOCATIONS THIS MONTH AND KNOW THAT THE NEED IS GREAT WITH AND MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. AND WOULD LIKE TO AND THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO WORK WITH THE LET THE ADMINISTRATION. TO BOTH MODIFY EXTEND AS WELL AS CODIFIED THE FLEXIBILITY IS AND STREAMLINING. THAT YOU WERE MENTIONING JUST A SECOND AGO- THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE EITHER THROUGH EXECUTIVE ORDER AND OR- STATE DEPARTMENTAL GUIDANCE. HAS REALLY HELPED AND I'M WONDERING. IF IN OUR BUDGET PROCESS FOR JUNE FIFTEENTH. CAN I ASK THE ADMINISTRATION'S PARTNERSHIP AS WE CRAFT THIS IN HOPES OF BEING ABLE. TO ADOPT THESE IN OUR BUDGET PROCESS I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF WE CAN CODIFY MANY OF THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE WITHIN YOUR EXECUTIVE ORDER. WITHIN OUR BUDGET PROCESS ON JUNE FIFTEENTH. AND IF I MAY JUST AS AN ASIDE. THROWIN WELL YOU HAVE WORKED ON CAL WORKS AND- AM APPRECIATIVE OF IT. I'M SENSITIVE TO THE FACT THAT MANY PEOPLE ON CAL WORKS ARE ON TIME CLOCKS. AND DURING THIS CRISIS WE HAVEN'T PAUSED THOSE TIME CLOCKS ARE STOPPED THOSE TIME CLOCKS. AND IN ESSENCE WHAT WE'RE DOING IS LIMITING- THOSE- A RESOURCE TO THOSE WHO NEED IT THE MOST IN A TIME WHEN THEY'RE MOST VULNERABLE. I WOULD LIKE TO GET THE A MINISTRY. HI THIS IS THAT THEY ARE ADAM YOU WANT TO GO FIRST. CERTAINLY I MEAN I THINK THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO EVALUATE IS THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS BàN I'M SUCH AN UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION AND WE'RE MOVING SO QUICKLY. YOU KNOW AS WE TRY TO RESPOND TO THE CRISIS AND I THINK THAT WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT A LOT OF THESE FLEXIBILITY IS WE'RE STILL SORT OF EVALUATING- BUT WHAT THE COSTS ARE NAMED SO AS WE GET INTO THE BUDGET CONVERSATION I DON'T THINK THAT WE CAN COMMIT TO OUTCOMES RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE'RE STILL WORKING ON DEVELOPING THE REVISION BUT- I THINK WE CAN COMMIT TO A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WE PRIORITIZE SOME OF THE FLEXIBILITY IS THAT WE- SHOULD ON SHORT TERM BASIS. EVERYTHING ELSE THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND FUNDED TO PRIORITIZE PART OF A BUDGET YOU KNOW AGREEMENT AT THE END OF THE- FISCAL YEAR. AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS. IF I CAN I'D LIKE TO TURN THE CONVERSATION TO THE EMERGENCY AID FOR THE UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY. AND I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR DISASTER RELIEF FUND. FOR THE UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY WHICH IS FUNDED THROUGH- THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. NOW THIS CURRENT FUND IS DESIGNED TO REACH A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS ALTHOUGH THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET CENTER ESTIMATES THAT. THE NUMBER OF UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THIS CRISIS IS THREE TIMES THAT AMOUNT. RECENTLY THE LEGISLATIVE CAUCUSES HAVE NOW WAIT IN WITH THE REQUEST FOR A MODICUM OF RELIEF. FOR THIS COMMUNITY OF CALIFORNIANS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE QUALIFY FOR FEDERAL RELIEF BUT FOR THEIR STATUS. AND SO I WANT TO ASK. WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE TO THE RECENT LETTER FROM THE LATINO. BLACK API JEWISH AN ELBOW G. B. T. Q. CAUCUSES. ASKING FOR SUPPORT FOR I TEN FILERS WITH THE ITC. ASSEMBLYMEMBER ANGLE OF THIS IS THE DATE FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO DEFINITELY- AS YOU MENTION WHAT THE APPROPRIATION THAT MONEY THAT THE STATE PUT FORWARD AND WHAT WE- HAVE SOMEONE PARTNERS- FOR UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS THIS IS A PRIORITY ESPECIALLY GIVING. THE GAPS THAT WOULD SEEM FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO AYE TEN FIVE HOURS IN THE EITC- THAT SIMPLE HAS TO BE WEIGHED AT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE OVERALL BUDGET BECAUSE- THEY RAISE- GENERAL FUND TRADE OFF AND WE KNOW WE'RE DEALING WITH THE SIGNIFICANTLY CONSTRAINED GENERAL FUND PICTURE- AND THAT WOULD ALSO BE AN- ON GOING CHANGE. IN DATA SETS AND SO WE ARE LOOKING AT THE STRUCTURE OF OUR BUDGET NOT JUST FOR THE COMING YEAR OR THE CURRENT YEAR BUT FOR SEVERAL YEARS FORRIGHT SO I THINK THE GOVERNOR STILL MAKING HIS DECISIONS ON THAT. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECEIVED THE FEEDBACK AND IT'S ON OUR RADAR SCREEN- BUT I THINK UNTIL THE GOVERNOR PUTS OUT HIS NAY REVISION. I CAN'T REALLY GET AHEAD OF HIS DECISION. IF I MAY I'M GOING TO- CHANGE THE SUBJECT AND- ADDRESS MY FINAL TWO QUESTIONS. IN TERMS OF HOW WE HELP TO STABILIZE THE MEDICAL SYSTEM. AND I WILL EDITORIALIZE AN AD THAT I AM NOT SURE THAT THE FEDERAL FUNDING IS SUFFICIENT- AND BELIEVE THAT MORE WILL BE NEEDED FOR US TO STABILIZE THE MEDICAL SYSTEM. AND I'D LIKE TO ADD ON TO MY COLLEAGUES REGARDING A REGULATION. UNFUNDED MANDATE THAT WE'VE- PASSED IT THAT MAY CAUSE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL TROUBLES FOR OUR HOSPITALS. AND I'M WONDERING IF WE CAN BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT EVERY YEAR WE- TALK ABOUT CLOSURES OF MORE HOSPITALS AND HOW THIS- REALLY. LIMITS OUR ACCESS TO EMERGENCIES AND OTHER TYPES OF HOSPITAL CARE WHICH PLACES OUR COMMUNITIES AT RISK AND NOW IRONICALLY IT IS OUR HEALTH CARE CRISES WHICH HAS EMPTIED OUR HOSPITALS. CUTTING OFF POTENTIALLY PUTTING THEMSELVES ON LIFE SUPPORT. MY SECOND LARGEST HOSPITAL IN FRESNO COUNTY FOR LOAD A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES YESTERDAY OR SIX AND A HALF PERCENT OF THEIR ENTIRE WORK FORCE. AND SO I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND AND- ASK THE ADMINISTRATION IF THEY WOULD SUPPORT REVISITING THE CURRENT SEISMIC RETROFITTING REQUIREMENTS. AND DEADLINES FOR LOW RISK HOSPITALS AS A WAY TO REDUCE THE IMMENSE FISCAL PRESSURES PARTICULARLY ON A RURAL HOSPITALS. ALL TRYING TO SORT OF LIKE A LIKE ADAM DORSEY. ALL YEAH SO- I THINK THAT- IT WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT HERE IS THAT YOU KNOW WHAT WE YOU KNOW AGREE THAT THERE IS A BIT OF A PROBLEM RIGHT NOW AND THAT- YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY VERY CLOSELY WITH THE INDUSTRY- BUT THIS IS BEEN A REAL. A PRIORITY OF OURS IN OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE ASKED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH RESPECT TO RELIEF- AND- WE'VE GOT MARK MARK OF EACH YEAR DAVE- CAN TALK MORE ABOUT- AUSTIN'S ROLE pCERTAINLY YOU KNOW OVER THE COURSE OF MANY YEARS THE ADMINISTRATION. HAS WORKED WITH HOSPITALS AND THAT WITH THE LEGISLATURE- WITH RESPECT TO- SEISMIC SAFETY- ISSUES AS THEY ARISE WITH FACILITIES THAT- YOU KNOW EVER HAVING TROUBLE MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS BUT CERTAINLY- THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE KIND OF CASE BY CASE BASIS AND OPEN DISCUSSIONS AND HAPPENED AT HANDED OVER TO HHS IF THEY HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD ON THAT. THANKS ADAM BY DR MARTIN. WITH HHS I ALSO THE- OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE AS ACTING DIRECTOR OF. THE OFFICE IT MIGHT HELP PLANNING DEVELOPMENT THAT- THAT. IMPLEMENTS A SEISMIC SAFETY REQUIREMENTS- ON HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND ASKING TO WHY- ADAM DORSEY JUST ALLUDED TO- WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR HOSPITAL SYSTEMS. AS PART OF THE TWENTY TWENTY REQUIREMENTS. AND WE CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH HOSPITALS AND YOUR DELIVERY SYSTEMS AROUND THE TWENTY THIRTY REQUIREMENTS- AND CERTAINLY- WILL FOLLOW UP WITH YOU IN TERMS OF- THOSE CONVERSATIONS I KNOW THAT YOU WILL OBVIOUSLY HAVE. HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS IN HOSPITALS IN YOUR DISTRICT DO OTHERS- AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AS WE LOOK AND ACCESS. THAT ARE. THANK YOU AND UP AS MY FINAL I REALLY WANTED TO DIG INTO MLR AND DON'T MEAN TO GET TO ONE KEY BUT- MEDICAL LOSS RATIO IS A BILL THAT WAS CHAPTER TO A FEW YEARS AGO I. BELIEVE IT WAS AB TWENTY FOUR NINETY NINE. BUT AS MANY OF YOU KNOW CERTAIN INSURANCE INDUSTRIES HAVE BEGUN RETURNING PAYMENTS TO CONSUMERS AS OUR LIFESTYLES HAVE CHANGED SUCH AS DRIVING LESS. HOWEVER THE HEALTH INSURANCE DâN THE MANAGED CARE INDUSTRY HAS YET TO DO THE SAME. AND DESPITE THAT THE PROVIDERS AND THEIR NETWORKS ARE DRAMATICALLY SEEING LESS MEDICAL CARE OR GIVING LESS MEDICAL CARE TO THEIR PATIENTS AND SO I'D LIKE TO ASK IS THE ADMINISTRATION WORKING WITH THE HEALTH INSURERS AND- MANAGED CARE PLANS TO UNDERSTAND THE AMOUNT OF RESERVES WHICH ARE BUILDING UP IN THE INDUSTRY. PARTICULARLY IN THE CONTEXT THAT THE STATUTORILY REQUIRED MEDICAL LOSS RATIO WHICH WAS ADOPTED THROUGH MY BILL. BUT ADAM DORSEY DISCUSS THIS AS WELL. ALL YOU ARE I GUESS THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT NODE ONE IS THAT YOU KNOW IT HEALTH PLANS ARE ARE KIND OF DIFFERENTLY SITUATED AND THERE ARE SOME HEALTH PLANS THAT ARE MAKING PAYMENTS TO- PROVIDER GROUPS AND HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS THAT I THINK ARE HELPFUL AND- IN STABILIZING. IN HELPING TO HELP STABILIZE THE SITUATION THAT'S BEING FACED BY THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDER COMMUNITY BUT- YOU KNOW OTHERS YOU KNOW DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY'RE IN A POSITION AS EARLY AS IN THE SAME WAY- THAT BUT- WHAT I'LL SAY ABOUT MLR IS THAT- MLR IS THE LAW OF THE LAND. AND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PLANS VERY YOU KNOW AND FORCE THEM ALL OUR- AND THAT. YOU KNOW OFTENTIMES THOSE ARE AS- YOU KNOW THINGS THAT TAKE A COUPLE OF YEARS AS AND WE AUDIT DATA AND ENFORCEMENT I'M KIND OF A CRUISE ON THE BACK END BUT- BUT- THAT. YOU KNOW THE PLAN IS RIGHT NOW IS TO IMPLEMENT CURRENT LAW WHICH INCLUDES YOU KNOW MEDICAL LOSS RATIO REQUIREMENTS. AND UP IF THE AGENCY HAS ANYTHING ELSE THAT ON THAT CERTAINLY. YEAH THANK YOU HAVE. IF THERE'S NOTHING TO ADD AND- I AM PRECIADO THAT IT'S THE LAW OF THE LAND BUT I BELIEVE WE ALSO HAVE TO ENFORCE THOSE LAWS AND SO I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND IF THE GOVERNOR IS WILLING TO- SIGN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO ENSURE THAT MLR IS RESPECTED AND ENFORCED. IN ORDER FOR US TO REBUILD OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. SO I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN TAKE BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT. THANK YOU I JUST THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO TRY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF- DECREASE. ACCESS THAT IS COME FROM COVERT NINETEEN. AND SO- WOULD WANT US TO LOOK TOWARDS TOOLS THAT- WE HAVE ESTABLISHED AND LOOK TO ENFORCE THOSE AND- BELIEVE THAT MLR IS A SIGNIFICANT WAY THAT WE CAN. LOOK TOWARDS STABILIZING OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND WOOD WANTS TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OVER THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS. WITH THAT I WILL TURN MY QUESTIONS BACK OVER TO YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU DOCTOR A BILLER MISTER MCCARTY EUROPE. THANK YOU THAT MISTER VICE CHAIR. I HAVE- A SERIES OF QUESTIONS BUT MOST HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED ALREADY SOFTRIDE WRAP MY UPS WE GET TO PUBLIC COMMENT. BUT I KNOW THAT TODAY'S FOCUSES ON THE RECOVERY AND ECONOMIC. THE ECONOMIC STIMULUS IN THIS FOCUS OF THAT IS IMPORTANT- I DO WANNA KNOW IT WOULDN'T SOMEONE MEMBER LIMóN SAID THAT WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR- CHILD CARE PROGRAMS FOR FAMILIES AND PARENTS THAT IT'S REALLY HARD TO GET BACK TO NORMAL SO WE'LL BE SPENDING SEVERAL HOURS TALKING ABOUT THAT TOMORROW SO I WILL HOLD THAT. I WANT TO FOCUS ON THE BIG PICTURE. RIGHT NOW AND REALLY ENGAGE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND LA- I KNOW THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE UPCOMING MAY REVISE. AND THE BUDGET DECISIONS. YOU KNOW THERE'S- TOUGH CONVERSATIONS AND- THE TALK ABOUT US THIRTY BUDGET IN TIGHTENING OUR BELTS. AND I GET THAT'S IMPORTANT- TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT I ALSO WANT TO KNOW THAT THINGS IS THAT. WE HAVE WE ALL REALIZE THIS THAT. THERE ARE REAL COSTS OF THAT AS WELL AND LOOK WE'RE NOT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE CAN'T PRINT OUR OWN MONEY- DOES NOT JUST THE ROUTE THAT WE CAN GO HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO WE HAVE TO. YOU KNOW BALANCE OUR BUDGET. BUT WE ALREADY HAVE A BIG PROBLEM AND I I'M NOT CERTAIN HOW HAVING. DOCTOR RAMBLIN I. ESSENTIALLY CUT. TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OUT OF OUR EDUCATION HEALTHCARE. SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA HOW THAT'S GOING TO. WORK HOW IT'S GONNA LESSEN THE PROBLEM AND FRANKLY WILL ONLY. EXASPERATED SO. REALLY AREN'T AREN'T OUR GOAL. BUDGET PROCESS SHOULD BE HOW TO BE BRIDGED THE PAIN FROM. WHETHER IT'S A ONE YEAR- GAP LOOKING AT OR A MULTI YEAR AND REALLY OUR GOAL SHOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE SHOULDN'T OUR NUMBER ONE FOCUS NOT BE MAKING. THE PROBLEM WORSE AND CREATING NEW PROBLEMS SO IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU LOOK AT JUST AN ESTIMATE AND I KNOW THIS IS JUST NUMBERS PULLING FROM THIS GUY WE DON'T HAVE THE MAY REVISE IN FRONT OF US. LET'S SAY THAT THE GAP THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS THIRTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS I'M JUST THROWING A NUMBER OUT THERE IT'S NOT THE GAP OF COURSE YET MAYBE SOMEONE WILL SAY IT IS A NUMBER LIKE THAT. LET'S SAY LET'S THE THREE YEAR GAP IS SEVENTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS WELL IF YOU LOOK AT. THE END THE EDUCATION BUDGET YOU COULD LOOK AT- THE ENTIRE HIGHER EDUCATION BUDGET YOU SEE CSU COMMUNICATIVE CAL GRANT- SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS YOU CAN LOOK AT OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA- ALMOST A BILLION DOLLARS YOU CAN LOOK AT THE ENTIRE. CHILD CARE AND EARLY EDUCATION IN PRESCHOOL BY JUST IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S ROUGHLY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AND SELL I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WOULD SAY GETTING TWENTY TWO BILLION BY COMPLETELY ELIMINATING THOSE THINGS. WOULD HELP US ON OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND SO WE GET THAT WE CAN'T PRINT MONEY LIKE THAT FEDERAL MEANT BUT I MY QUESTION IMPLORE US. TO WE HAVEN'T HAD A ALL FOR ON OUR OUR NARROW PAST PRACTICES FROM PRIOR RECESSIONS TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN KEEP STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT HOLE- WE HEARD EARLIER WE TALKED ABOUT DEFERRALS WITH- WE WITH RESPECT TO EDUCATION- YOU KNOW- USING OUR ONE TIME MONEY AND RESERVE- SOME MAY SAY WELL THAT'S T. IS A SMOKE AND MIRRORS BUDGET WELL MAYBE. HAVING IT CALLED THAT IN KEEPING OUR SCHOOLS AND CHILDCARE IS- CENTERS AND PROVIDERS OPEN IN OUR ON OUR SYSTEMS OF HIGHER EDUCATION OPEN THOSE ARE KEY. TO OUR ECONOMY TO KEEPING US GOING FORWARD SO- THE QUESTION IS DEPARTMENT OF. FINANCE HOW ARE WE LOOKING AT OPTIONS THAT ARE LESS PAINFUL TO ALLOW US TO KEEP OUR ESSENTIAL GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS- THAT KEEP OUR ECONOMY GOING. TO KEEP THOSE- GOING FOR IN CALIFORNIA SO THE- F. AND LA PLEASE. YES ASSEMBLYMEMBER PARTY ALL SPEAK AND I KNOW LA- WILL HAVE COMMENTS AS WELL I THINK YOU OUTLINED A CHALLENGE. I ALSO. HELP THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO ADD EXCEPT THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT ALL THE OPTIONS THAT IN MANY OF THE WAYS THAT YOU DESCRIBE THINKING OUT. FIRST OF ALL WHAT'S AVAILABLE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WE CAN OF ICE THESE ISSUES- DEALING WITH OUR ISSUES BUT ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE ISSUES THAT ARE VERY COMPELLING AND THAT WE ARE IN PARTNERSHIP ADMINISTER. THAT WE DELIVER FOR CALIFORNIANS. ALSO THE ISSUE USE RESERVE RECOGNIZING AS YOU SAT WITH SCOTT THE ONE YEAR GAP. THREE YEAR GAP. WE DO HAVE SOME. CAN PART BECAUSE IT THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR AND PRETTY I IN THE GOVERNOR MADE ABOUT PUTTING MONEY AWAY AND SAVING FOR A RAINY DAY AND THE CREATION OF THE SAFETY NET RESERVE BUT AT THE SAME TIME NOT DUMPING THAT ALL IN THE FIRST YEAR WHICH MIGHT RELIEVE THE PAIN AND BUDGET YEAR BUT THEN IN THAT YEAR AFTER THAT YEAR AFTER THAT COULD LEAD TO EVEN. CAUGHT THE AND IT'S- CAN I THAT. WE DON'T WANT TO TAKE TO ACTIONS THAT CREATE LONG TERM COSTS THAT HURT- PEOPLE IN THE STATE IN THE STATE BUDGET YOU KNOW. THREE FIVE TEN YEARS DOWN THE ROAD. BUT AT THE SAME TIME RECOGNIZING THAT WHILE WE WILL HAVE. THAT ARE PAINFUL IN FACT VERY PAINFUL- WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY OF NOT JUST WATCHING EVERYTHING IN SIGHT BECAUSE WE ALSO EVEN AS WE APPROACH THIS VERY DIFFICULT BOTCHED SEASON. NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MAINTAIN THE INVESTMENTS IN PROTECTING OUR MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE. AND ALSO THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE AT AND MANY OF THE BEST THINGS THAT YOU MADE US ALL INTO EXACTLY THAT CATEGORY. SO LIKE YOU SAID THERE'S NO MAGIC SOLUTION TAUGHT TO IT BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT EVERY AVAILABLE OPTION- IN TERMS OF THAT DECISIONS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S MAKING. OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS FOR HIS NAY RECREATION. AND WILL BE DOING WHAT'S ALL THE OF. OKAY ASSEMBLYMEMBER MCCARTY THIS IS OUR GATE PRODUCT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST. AND YOUR QUESTION IS VERY WELL TAKEN I THINK- THE CHALLENGE. THAT THE STATE WILL PLACE COULD BE SIGNIFICANT AS- THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT AS INDICATED. THAT THEY THINK THAT. THE SOLUTION TO THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER. THIS THE- SEVERAL LAY TO THE STORE. YOUR COMBINING THE USE OF JUDICIAL USE OF RESERVE. MAYBE ARE INTERNAL BORROWING AND THEN ALSO THERE ARE NO BUDGETARY- SHIPS OR PERHAPS THERE'S SOME SOME KIND OF DEFERRALS THAT WOULD HAVE LESS LESS OUR IMPACT ON THE OPTIONS IN ANY MATERIAL WAY SO THE COMBINATION OF THOSE AND THEN HOPEFULLY- IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL FEDERAL ASSISTANCE FORTHCOMING THEN THAT WOULD. REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE PROBLEM BUT I DO THINK IT SHOULD BE- RECOGNIZED FOR A MOMENT THAT THE SIZE OF THE STATE BUDGET RESERVE THAT HAS BEEN BUILT UP OVER THE EXPANSION IS REALLY A KEY ASSET FOR THE STATE AND FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE AT ITS DISPOSAL AND ONCE WE HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT THE BUDGET PROBLEM YEAH I THINK YOU WILL- YOU KNOW YOU. WANT TO DROP THAT DOWN THIS IS WHAT THIS IS THE RAINY DAY THAT IT WAS BUILT. MORE THAN ONE WAY THEY HOPE YOU WITH THAT OR OFFICE IS. CURRENTLY WORKING ON. DEVELOP SOME. FISCAL ESTIMATES WOULD LOOK AT JUST KIND OF GO INTO THE- JUST GO LIBERTY. YOU GO INTO WITH A SENSE OF WHAT THE BASELINE OF EXPENDITURES IS WE'RE WORKING ON SORT OF A- AN UPDATE CALLING IT OUR SPRING OUTLOOK AS OPPOSED TO OUR NOVEMBER FALLOUT. AND THAT WE HOPE TO PROVIDE YOU WITH KIND OF A YOU KNOW EXPENDITURE BASED HIGH IN AN EXPENDITURE BASED LOW AND- THOSE WOULD BE SOME WAYS TO GIVE SOME. WAYS TO MAINTAIN CURRENT SERVICES AND RESISTING BASELINE BUDGET BUT THEN. THIRD THERE ARE MORE COSTLY INCLUDING THE LESS COSTLY WAYS TO DO THAT YOU'RE GOING TO PRESENT THAT TO YOU AS A- SO ROUND FOR DISCUSSION- OF COURSE IT WILL BE. VERY CRUCIAL A INFORMED BY WHAT THE GOVERNMENT ARMY REVISION INCLUDES- BUT- WE HOPE THIS WILL BE A GOOD PLACE TO START. YEAH THAT AND THOSE FRANKLY ARE ARE JUST THE ANSWER IS I WAS HOPING FOR AYE AYE I WOULD NOT WANT TO HAVE OUR GOAL TO BE GETTING THE OTHER NATIONAL AWARD FOR AN AUSTERITY BUDGET AND- SLASH. AND RAISING TAXES OF COURSE AS WE HEARD FROM SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES BUT- WHAT CAN WE DO CREATIVELY AND LOOK AT OUR PAST RECESSIONS BUT I ALSO. THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX AND I THINK THAT- OUR NUMBER ONE GOAL SHOULD BE TO NOT MAKE THE PROBLEM WORSE AND- CUTTING ACCESS AT HIGHER EDUCATION AND- HEALTH CARE BACKS AS CHILD CARE SLOTS- EARLY EDUCATION PRE K. PROGRAMS AFTER SCHOOL GETTING RID OF THOSE THINGS ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE THE SITUATION. A YEAH SO I. ASK NOW QUESTIONS ON- BUT I HAVEN'T HEARD. THAT TO. KNOW HAVE COME UP ABOUT THE RECOVERY IN CALIFORNIA. ONE IS ROM OUR OUR FOLKS IN THE BUILDING TRADES IN AND LABOR- FEW DAYS AGO. OUR LOCAL CARPENTERS INVITED ME TO GO ACROSS THE STREET AND ACTS ACTS I COULDN'T GO BECAUSE RIGHT IN OUR FIRST YEAR. THEY WANTED ME TO OR THE MINISTER THEATER EGGS. ACROSS THE CAN ANNOUNCED THEY HAVE THEIR- FOLKS WERE OUT THERE. ON SAY AND SO WILL DISTANCING AND THAT ESSENTIAL. GO THAT IS ENDING. BUT THERE pTHROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THAT ARE. ON THE BUBBLE ESPECIALLY IN CERTAIN AREAS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. ON THE HINK THE THINK ABOUT THINGS LIKE OUR OUR HOUSING SHORTAGE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SORTAGE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING WORKFORCE HOUSING THE WORKS. WEEK WE'D WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE THAT SO WHAT ARE WE DOING TO ENSURE THAT- THESE ESSENTIAL CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS- CAN REMAIN AND WE CAN- ADDRESS. THESE ESPECIALLY SOME OF THE REGIONS THAT HAVE SOME OF THAT- LIMITATIONS RIGHT NOW. I CAN SPEAK AT BRIEFLY TO THAT AND THEN I KNOW THAT WAY ON THE AT COMMENTS AS WELL I THINK. IT IS DEFINITELY GOING TO BE CHALLENGING- WITH YOUR- MARK YOUR DOLLARS BAND WE WERE ANTICIPATING IN JANUARY- BUT WHEN IT COMES SPECIFICALLY CHAT HOUSING AS YOU MENTIONED THAT THIS WAS. A HOUSING AND OF COURSE HOMELESSNESS RELATED ISSUE- THIS IS THE TOP PRIORITY THE GOVERNOR AND AS- WE ALL RECALL IF HE DEVOTED HIS. IN TOP OF THE STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS HERE TO HOMELESSNESS SO WE ARE TRYING TO FIND A WAY EVEN WITHIN THIS CONSTRAINED BUDGET. THAT WE'RE CAN TO PUSH THE PACE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION AND MAKE. HOW AFFORDABLE. MORE PORTABLE PLAY TO LAND SO THE EXACT WAYS AND WE'RE GONNA DO MORE. WITH YOUR RESOURCES WE ARE WORKING FOR THAT RIGHT NOW AND AFTER THAT THEY WERE VISION YOU TO WILL BE DISCUSSING WITH ALL OF YOU- AS YOU PRINT FOR YOUR PROPOSALS BUT IT IS DEFINITELY. A PRIORITY ON HOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE HITTING OUR GOALS IN TERMS OF HOUSING CONSTRUCTION AND ALSO MAKING SURE THAT IN THIS ENVIRONMENT. RAPIDLY RISING UNEMPLOYMENT- WE'RE MAKING SURE THAT GOOD PAYING JOBS OUT THERE CONTINUES TO BE A PATH FOR THOSE AND I THINK THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY. TASK FORCE OF WILL BE FOCUSED ON SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS WELL. OKAY THANK YOU TWO TWO MORE QUESTIONS. ONE IS ON WE TALKED EARLIER IN YOUR PRESENTATION ABOUT UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND OF COURSE WE HAVE THAT INCREDIBLE NUMBER OF PEOPLE APPLYING CALIFORNIA NORTH NORTH OF THREE MILLION WE ALSO HAVE THAT ARE YOU KNOW STATUS BILLION PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAMS AND I GUESS THE QUESTION THAT WE ASK FOR BUDGET PEOPLE IS. HOW DO WE MAKE THESE PENCIL OUT FOR THIS FOR IT WITH STATE RESOURCE IS EMPLOYERS HAVING THEIR CONTRIBUTION THEIR SHARE AND POTENTIAL FEDERAL MONEY BUT THE REAL QUESTION FRANKLY PEOPLE ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THEY DON'T CARE HOW IT'S PAID FOR THIS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S AVAILABLE SO. ARE WE CERTAIN THAT IT'LL BE RELIABLE. TWO PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE DURATION OF THIS CO IN NINETEEN CRISIS. YES WHEN IT COMES TO THE- STATE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS- I KNOW THIS CAME UP AS YOU MENTIONED BRIEFLY EARLIER WE ARE REALLY DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN. TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE BENEFITS GET OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND THAT'S ALSO TRUE FOR THE FEDERAL BENEFITS BECAUSE A LOT OF THOSE YOU KNOW TEND TO FLOW THROUGH THE STATE SO FOR EXAMPLE THAT SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR BOOST- THAT YOU DE IS ALSO AND WEBER AGENCIES MAKING SURE THAT THOSE PAYMENTS AS WELL. ARE GOING OUT FOR A SYSTEM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WILL BE WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE ISSUES WITH. FEDERAL SUPPORT IN MAKING SURE THAT IT'S NOT GOING IN THAT THE ALONE SEPARATE CHECKING OUT AT THE INTEREST COST IS NOT FALLING DISPROPORTIONATELY ON US GIVEN THE HISTORIC CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WERE AND I THINK YOU'RE ALSO SEEING FOR EXAMPLE WHAT THE SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR PAYMENT- THAT SOME OF THAT WILL BE ENDING THIS SUMMER AT THE END OF JULY. AND SO WHAT NOBODY CAN SAY FOR SURE- WHERE WE WILL BE WITH THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS SO SEATED ECONOMIC IMPACT BY JULY I THINK IT'S A PRETTY STATE BET. THE IMPACT OF THE CRISIS BE. IT'S A FOR SURE SO EASY DAY AND WEBER AGENCY AT THE ADMINISTRATION ARE ALL FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THAT WHETHER IT'S OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS OR CALL CENTERS AT THE MONEY'S GETTING OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT I THINK YOU SAW THAT EVEN IN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS. WITH RELAXING SO THE CATION REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE TRADITIONALLY REQUIRED AND I THINK THE TWO OTHER THINGS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE DOINGIS NUMBER ONE. IN TO ENGAGE WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS TO MAKING SURE THAT IF MORE HELP IS NEEDED pOF THIS CALENDAR YEAR AT THAT AGE IS FORTHCOMING AND THEN TO. EVEN AS WE ARE TRYING TO. HAVE OUR LEGACY SYSTEMS YES IT OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THINKING THROUGH- WITH ALL THE EXPERTISE WE CAN BRING TO BEAR ON HOW WE CAN IMPROVE OUR SYSTEMS AND I THINK. JULIE SU AD IS MENTIONED LAST WEEK AT ANSWERED SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT ON HOW WE'RE TRYING TO BRING EVERY SINGLE RESOURCE TO BEAR SO. THIS IS A TOP PRIORITY WE UNDERSTAND EXACTLY AS YOU PUT IT BACK. FOLKS DON'T REALLY CARE WHO'S PAYING FOR IT WHERE WHERE IT'S COMING FROM THEY JUST ONE NOW THAT THEY HAVE IT WHEN THEY NEED IT SO THAT IS A PRIORITY FOR THE- AND SO YOU MENTIONED. YOU WHY BUT THAT THE SECOND PART OF MY QUESTION WAS ARE STATES DISABILITY AND PAM. AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE- EFFORTS PROGRAM SO. DO WE HAVE THE SAME CERTAINTY WITH THOSE TWO. YES I THINK IT COMES TO THAT IS THERE WILL HAVE MORE INFORMATION ON A REVISION BUT WE UNDERSTAND THOSE PROGRAMS ARE. CRITICAL AS WELL. YES AND THEN MY FINAL QUESTION IS RELATE TO WORKERS COMPENSATION. AND OF COURSE THERE IS SOME UNCERTAINTY NOW WITH CLAIMS WITH COVERT CLAIMS AND YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY THIS WILL BE- ADDRESS I KNOWS MY COLLEAGUE FROM L. GROSS ON THEM OR COOPER HAS ANNOUNCED LEGISLATION WHICH SIDE SUPPORT ON THIS TO MAKE SURE WE CAN PROTECT OUR FRONTLINE WORKERS BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW. WITHIN THE MINISTRATIONS FAR AS PEOPLE- BEING DENIED WORKERS COMP CLAIMS THAT HAS- COVERT NINETEEN. IMPACT IN TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INDIVIDUALS YOU KNOW GET THE GET THE GET THE BENEFITS THAT THEY DESERVE. SO ANY ISSUES WHEN IT COMES TO- THE SPECIFICS OF PEOPLE BEING DENIED WHICH IT MIGHT CLAIMS YOU KNOW DEFINITELY BRING THEM TO THE ADMINISTRATION AND BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND IN THIS EMERGENCY AT THOSE CLAIMS NEED TO BE ADJUDICATED. FAIRLY OBVIOUS ON THAT I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION MORE GENERALLY AND I KNOW YOU MENTIONED A LEGISLATION THE GOVERNOR HASN'T WEIGHED IN ON THAT YES I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD DEAL OUT. I DO NOT GONNA HAS. THANK YOU HAS MY FINAL QUESTION THE STRUCTURE. THANK YOU MISTER BUSH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I TOOK NOTE TO I THINK IT WAS YESTERDAY- TIM COOK THE CEO OF APPLE- GAVE HIS OPINION- TO THE PRESIDENT THAT- HE FELT WE WERE GOING TO BE IN A WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS A V. SHAPED ECONOMY WHICH WAS CHARACTERIZED BY A VERY RAPID DECLINE. AND THEN HE FELT- THERE WOULD BE A RAPID IMPROVEMENT AND IN THE ECONOMY AND I THINK THAT AT THAT'S AN OPTIMISTIC VIEW OF WHERE WE MIGHT BE HEADED- BUT I THINK THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE ECONOMY THAT WE HAD ARE GOING TO RETURN AND TO AND THERE IS SOME REASON. FOR OPTIMISM. I THINK IT'S WORTHY OF US TO BE THINKING ABOUT WHAT ARE OUR GOALS ARE- FOR THE FUTURE WHEN THE ECONOMY DOES RETURN. AND I WAS HEARTENED WHEN- I BELIEVE IT WAS THE ADMINISTRATION- MENTIONED TO- THE- APARTMENT FINANCE MENTIONED THAT PROTECTING VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES WOULD BE A UP A PRIORITY. AND I AGREE I THINK THAT SHOULD BE A OF A PRIORITY- I THINK ANOTHER PRIORITY OUGHT TO BE PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND IMPROVING OUR BEST BENSON HOW WE PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND MY COLLEAGUES HAVE. HAVE MENTIONED THE NEED TO INCREASE- AND TAKE STEPS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF DOCTORS AND NURSES AND ALLIED HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS THAT ARE OUT THERE ARE NO. OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM A MODESTO IS INTERESTED IN INCREASING- THE AVAILABILITY OF NURSING THROUGH A PROGRAMS THAT- I THINK IT'S AT MERCED. I'M AND I THINK I THINKTHESE ARE VERY VALUABLE GOALS BUT WHAT- I THINK IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND WHAT IS- REALLY I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WE LEARNED FROM. THE PANDEMIC THAT WERE INVOLVED IN IS THAT WE HAVE TO INCREASE OUR EFFORTS ON THE PREVENTION SIDE OF. THE WE'VE GOTTEN VERY GOOD AT TREATING DISEASE- BUT WE HAVE REALLY LEFT BEHIND EFFORTS TO- A TO PREVENT DISEASE FROM HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THAT IS PLAYING OUT OF WITH. A TRULY DEVASTATING RESULTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD TODAY. HOW MINUTES EVERYTHING FROM OUR- LACK OF PREPARATION WITH- NOT STOCKPILING PP- VENTILATORS OTHER ESSENTIAL EQUIPMENT. I TO A LACK OF FOCUS ON- MANY OF THE- FACTORS THAT ARE MAKING A WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A DIFFICULT SITUATION UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE BUT ARE MAKING IT WORSE NAMELY- THE FACT THAT WE HAVE ALLOWED A CRISIS OF- AN EPIDEMIC OF OBESITY AND TO- DIABETES AND OTHER CO OCCURRING DISORDERS. TO FASTER FOR MANY MANY YEARS SO- I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT THAT BE ONE OF OUR PRIORITIES GOING FORWARD I'M WONDERING IF- ANY OF THREE. OUR FOLKS HERE HAVE BEEN VERY PATIENT AND HAVE STUCK IT OUT UNTIL NOW- IF- IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS IN THAT REGARD. NUMBER ONE THIS IS A MISS WON OUT AND I THINK- YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT THAT THIS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND THAT. TREATMENT IS NOT NOT SAID THERE REALLY NEEDS TO BE A FOCUS ON PREVENTION I THINK IN THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET I HE REALLY PUT OUT A NUMBER PROPOSAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT BECOMES OF THE GOALS OF THE OBJECTIVES OF. HOW WE DELIVER CARE HEALTHCARE THAT IS FOCUSES ON THE WHOLE PERSON AND FOCUSES ON ALL THE DRIVERS ARE THAT CREATE PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGES AND NOT SIMPLY DELIVERING. TREAT CERTAINLY. ALLEN'S NOW I WE ARE GOING FOR OUR HELPING HUMANS ADD BUDGET THIS WEEKEND. AS WE PREPARE FOR THE NAY REVISION. YOU KNOW WE'RE CERTAINLY NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO MAKE ALL THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE HAD ANTICIPATED IN JANUARY. AND THAT'S GONNA BE TOPS YOU KNOW AT THE VERY MOMENT THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING A CRISIS THAT SHOWS. JUST HOW MUCH THOSE INVESTMENTS ARE NEEDED BUT I THINK THAT OBJECTIVE AND THAT FRAME IS STILL THERE WILL NOT ONLY ABOUT PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. BUT DELIVERING SERVICES TO THAT AND% IN A WAY WHERE WE ARE GETTING TO THE PREVENTION AND BROADER PUBLIC HEALTH- ISSUES THAT YOU MENTIONED AND NOT SIMPLY TREATING EGGS AT THE BACK. AND MARCO. WANT ANY. THANK YOU. Q. WELL IN ORDER FOR US TO GET THERE IN ORDER FOR US TO ADD THIS- RETURN HAVE A SEAT PEOPLE RETURNING TO WORK- WE HAVE TO RAMP BUT I THINK IT'S A GENERALLY ACCEPTED TODAY THAT WE HAVE TO WRAP UP PARK ARE AT THE TESTING IN A DRAMATIC WAY AND TO I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT- THE- OVER SOME. OF OUR OF OUR TESTING PROGRAMS- SEEMS TO BE. THE WHELP OVERSIZE NOT THE WORD RIGHT WORD THAT ARE- THAT OUR PROGRAM AND OUR PROGRAMMATIC APPROACH TO INCREASING WE- ACCESS TO TESTING SEEMS TO BE WORKING AND THE- AS OF LAST WEEK I THINK WE'RE AT SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THOUSAND TESTS- OKAY A LITTLE BIT AHEAD OF SCHEDULE FULL TO THE ANTICIPATED. A TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PER DAY- THE TO WERE EXPECTING AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MNTH REALLY AT THE VERY END OF THIS WEEK. I'M BUT I'M A LITTLE BIT PERPLEXED AND DISAPPOINTED THAT WE ARE NOT AT THIS POINT FIVE DAYS BEFORE- WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND. THAT WE DON'T HAVE A AND UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THOSE GUYS ARE GOING TO WRAP UP BEYOND THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND AND TO THAT TO ME IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE BECAUSE I THINK- THE- NUMBER OF TESTS THAT ARE REQUIRED. THROUGHOUT THE STATORS SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF- BEWEEN SIXTY AND EIGHTY THOUSAND IF I RECALL CORRECTLY AND WE'RE STILL A LONG WAY FOR OUT SO IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT CAN BE- PROVIDED. AS TO WHERE WE ARE ON TESTING AND THAT'LL HAVE FOLLOW UP QUESTION OF ABOUT TO CONTACT GRAYSON. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THIS IS MONICA MEETS WITH THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES SO EAT RIGHT YOU'RE CORRECT WE ARE ON OUR WAY TO GET TO THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MARK BY THE END OF THE WEEK OR BY THE END OF THE MONTH. I AND AS SECRETARY IN THE GOVERNOR AND NOTED- IT LAST WEEK OUR GOAL IS TO GET TO ANOTHER SIXTY TO EIGHTY THOUSAND- PER DAY AND MOVING FORWARD. AND THERE ARE MULTIPLE POCKETS OF WORK- THAT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT ASTOR MINOR STRATEGY IS YEAH. WELL RIGHT THE FIRST ONE IS REALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW WE- ARE CAPACITY- BY WRITING ONLINE HIGH. RIGHT I TESTING SITE SO THESE ARE PLACES WHERE YOU COULD DO A LOT OF TESTING ALL UP ONE ASK THAT UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEMS OBVIOUSLY HAVE A LOT. AB OUR COMMERCIAL PLANES I HAVE LAW LEVER WE ARE ACT WORKING WITH ALL OF THE STATE THINK ABOUT I'M ADDED CAPACITY THE SPACE THAT WE COULD DO A LOT OF MORE HIGH THROUGH PROTESTING I SO IT'S NOT ONE OR TWO TESTS DURING THEIR BUT- HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF TEST A IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO BE FROM OUR CITY SO THAT'S ONE. THIS LINE ABOUT. IS REALLY THINKING ABOUT DO WE STRATEGICALLY DEPLOYED POINT OF CARE I TASK AND THESE ARE TESTS PRIMARILY DONE IN HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SETTINGS- AND THEY ARE LOW VOLUME BY FAX TEST. IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO- USE THAT INFORMATION FROM A CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE IN ORDER TO MAKE DECISIONS AROUND. WITH AN INDIVIDUAL POSITIVE EFFECT EXAMPLE. IS SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IF WE CAN QUICKLY CAST SOMEBODY AND DETERMINED THAT THEY ARE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE IF THEY'RE POSITIVE THEN WE CAN MOVE QUICKLY AROUND MITIGATION TO ISOLATE THAT INDIVIDUAL WITHIN OUR FACILITY. SO THAT THEY ARE NOT EXPOSED QUICKER SO OUR ABILITY TO DEPLOY THESE POINT OF CARE TASK IS REALLY IMPORTANT PARTICULARLY IN RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE AS WELL AS- PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE WE HAVE HIGH VOLUMES ARE STILL NURSING FACILITY OR CONGREGATE CARE. I SETTINGS FOR LONG TERM CARE ON THE LONG TERM CARE SIDE THE REALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW WE AND OUR ABILITY TO DO THAT. THE THIRD LINE OF EFFORT IS REALLY AROUND THE SEROLOGY. TASK AB OBVIOUSLY HAS ITS- CAST THAT WE ARE ON CARRYING A WE'RE GRATEFUL TRAP PARTNER. I AM YEAR AND THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE ARE BEEN WORKING WITH STANFORD TO GET THIS WRONG WOULD YOU TEST- ON THEIR END AS WELL AND A SEROLOGY TEST IS DIFFERENT FROM MY PCR TEST IN THE SENSE THAT IT REALLY LOOKS AT THE ANTI BODIES AND THE- LIVE- ACTED TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT YOU BUILD. IMMUNITY I FOR A PARTICULAR VIRUS AND THAT IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT. TO US AS WE LOOK AT MORE COMMUNITY SURVEILLANCE CORPORATE OR AND SO WE'RE ACTIVELY WORKING ON GETTING MORE OF THESE BLOOD TESTS OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY SO. THAT WE CAN IMPROPER ABILITY TO TEST MORE BROADLY AND THEN RELEASED THE FORT LINE OF EFFORT OR THE FOURTH POCKET. IS WHAT I WILL CALL LOOKING AT THESE TESTING DESERT SO REALLY BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHERE ARE WE WHERE DO WE HAVE SPECIMEN COLLECTION SITES NOT NECESSARILY WHERE YOU CAN GO GET TESTED BECAUSE- CERTAINLY WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO SHIP SPECIMENS. THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE TO CALIBRATE CAPACITY IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO YOU TESTING OR MORE IMPORTANTLY WHERE DO WE HAVE A SPECIMEN COLLECTION SITES. THE ORDER FOR US TO BE EQUITABLE. IN TERMS TO. HOW WE GET PEOPLE IN THE DOOR TAX TEST SO LAST WEEK AGAIN THE GOVERNOR NOW A PART OF WITH OFTEN SIR WHICH IS GOING. I HAVE UP RIGHT NOW. EIGHTY SO. AND WE'RE WORKING WITH FIFTEEN TO TWENTY AYE AYE DIFFERENT COUNTIES RIGHT NOW TO IDENTIFY THOSE SITES. IN ORDER FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING THESE TESTING SPECIMEN COLLECTION. THIRDS ASSET WE'RE ACTUALLY HAVING A TO. COLLECT SO. ALL THIS TO SAY IS THAT WE ARE NOT PUTTING ALL OUR EGGSIN ONE BASKET OR LOOKING AT JUST ONE STRATEGY OUR STRATEGY IS HAS FOUR DIFFERENT CRIMES IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THE NEEDLE. AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND THEN THE LAST THING I WILL SAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS THAT WE ARE CONTINUING OUR SAID THIS ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS NOW WE'RE ACTIVELY LOOKING AT WHAT IS A SUPPLY CHAIN LOOK LIKE. AND HOW DO WE NOT ONLY- ADD TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN BUT A DRESS THAT SUPPLY CHAIN SHORTAGES SO I'M IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT TRYING TO PROCURE AN ADDITIONAL FILES FILES A VIRAL MEDIA. ARE THE REASON WHICH WE CAN MAKE OUR OWN VIRAL MEDIA AND SO THOSE ARE THE EFFORTS THAT ARE UNDER WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT ONLY YOU CAN. ASK THE OWNER. TO TAX BUT I. OUR CITY BEST TO BE ABLE TO EXPRESSED. THE STATE ENACT WAY. THANK YOU FOR A THEM OF DETAIL RESIDUE OF SORT OF WHERE WE ARE ALL ON TESTING. THE ONE THE ONE THING- THAT I THINK IS NOT WHERE THEY LET LET ME BACK UP FOR A SECOND SAY THAT I- HAD THE- PRESENTATION LAST WEEK- THERE WAS A- ONLINE- PRESENTATION UP FROM THE TESTING TASK FORCE THAT PRESENTED A LOT OF- AND THAT INFORMATION AND MORE- I WAS VERY VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE- AND ALSO CAME AWAY WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF JUST HOW COMPLEX THIS ISSUE AS- A BUT THE MAIN THRUST OF MY QUESTION WAS WHETHER WE WERE POSITION TO PROJECT WITH ANY DEGREE OF CERTAINTY- WHEN WILL BE ABLE TO ACT AS WE DID A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND SAYING WE WOULD BE ABLE TO WRAP UP TO TWENTY. FIVE THOUSAND TODAY WHEN WE WOULD BE TO- OF MOVE THAT GOAL POSTS TO THIRTY THOUSAND AND THIRTY FIVE IN FOR SO LONG SO FORTH AND IT APPEARS TO ME THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT NEED TO FALL INTO PLACE BEFORE WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THAT WITH ANY. PREDICTABLE UP SO THAT LEADS ME TO MY NEXT QUESTION. AND COMMENT WHICH- HAS TO DO WITH CONTACT TRACING AND I THINK THAT- WITHOUT GOING INTO A LOT OF DETAIL ABOUT CONTACT TRACING. THE FEWER ACTUAL TASKS THAT ARE OUT THERE THE MORE IMPORTANT THE CONTACT TRACING BECOMES AND IT'S LABOR INTENSIVE IT IS SOMETHING THAT WILL TAKE SOME AMOUNT TIME TO RAMP UP. AND HI I ASSUME IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS GIVING A LOT OF THOUGHT TO I CERTAINLY HOPE SO OTHER STATES ARE OTHER JURISDICTIONS PLACES AROUND THE WORLD- WE HAVE- IN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER. A GROUP OF FIVE FOURTEEN HUNDRED COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS THAT ARE- BEGINNING TO ORGANIZE THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY HAVE- THE TYPES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TRAINED AND- OF A HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH MEMBERS THE COMMUNITY ABOUT HEALTHCARE ISSUES. TAKING NOTES- ENTERING IT INTO A SYSTEM THAT VERY- IMPORTANT SKILL SET THAT LENDS ITSELF TO THIS THEY CAN ALSO DO TRAINING OF OTHER OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS AND I WILL- WOULD JUST LIKE TO ASK IF WE ARE- BEGINNING GUY OR IN ANY. STAGE OF- SCOTT OR MOVING ALONG IN THE DIRECTION OF- RAMPING UP FOR WHICH TO- CONTACT TRACING. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THIS IS MARK FROM EACH AGAIN WITH THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY AGENCY AND THAT IS A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND I'M VERY IMPORTANT AND TIMELY TOPIC. AS PART OF INDICATOR ONE OUT WE ARE REALLY LOOKING AT APPLE THE TESTING COMPONENT AS YOU ALLUDED TO THAT TESTING PIECE IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE JEFF CONTACT TRACING PEAS I'M A CONTRACTOR. USERS OF WRITING A DIFFERENT LINES OF OUR FOR PRICE TO REALLY BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE PULL AT SCALE ARE APPROACHING THINKING ABOUT WAYS IN WHICH WE ARE REALLY BELT OUT THE WORK FORCE IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND THAT IS GOING TO BE. REALLY IMPORTANT AS WE BEGIN TO LEFT OR MODIFY THE STAY AT HOME WORKER BECAUSE I ALMOST I USE THE ANALOGY OF A WILDFIRE OUT WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO REALLY IS TO- AND MITIGATE OR SOME CRACKS A BUNCH OF LITTLE FIRES SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE A MASSIVE FIRE ONCE WE'D YOU- GET TO A POINT WHERE WE'RE LISTING THAT. THE STATE I'M ORDER ANOTHER ONE WHAT YOU TRY TO DO WHAT CONTACT TRACING IS. IDENTIFYING INDIVIDUAL. I YOU KNOW FOR US TO BE TO ICE. AND SUPPRESS THE SPREAD OF VIRUS SO THAT THE- DOES BECOME. A DEAL I SO ON THE CONTACT. PART THERE'S A FEW LINES AFRICA WE ARE WORKING ON THE FIRST LINE OF EFFORT IS REALLY FOCUSED ON THE TRAINING COMPONENT. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO HAVE TO DO TO TRAIN MORE PEOPLE AND THE PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE IN THE WORK FORCE RIGHT NOW. YOU'RE REALLY. PASSAGE YOU I REALLY DRAFT DIFFERENT ABOUT HOW WE CAN CONTACT TRACING AND SO WE ARE WORKING ACTIVELY WITH- FULL ARE IN HI IRENE STATE PARTNERS ESPECIALLY THE UC SYSTEM'S ACTOR BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT TRAINING CURRICULUM THEY CURRENTLY HAVE WE ARE WORKING WITH THE CDC AROUND THEIR TRAINING CURRICULUM AND WE'RE ALSO WORKING OUT AND WE'VE BEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH OUR COLLEAGUES IN MASSACHUSETTS BECAUSE THEY ARE A FEW WEEKS OUT AHEAD OF US AND SO THEY'VE ALREADY STARTED SOME OF THIS CONTRACT TRACING WORK SO THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM THEIR LESSONS LEARNED. SO REALLY TRYING TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE BUILD THEIR TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT BACK ALLOWS US TO QUICKLY MORE INDIVIDUALS ONLINE SO THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY X. RAISING THE OTHER ASPECT IS REALLY THINKING. ABOUT THE WORK FORCE AND THIS IS REALLY WHERE. ARE WE HAVE TO CLOSE PART WITH OUR CALL. I IN A EVERYTHING THAT WE DO WITH REGARD TO MAKE IT A ONE ALTHOUGH THE TRAINING COMPONENT AND WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY WE HAVE TO PARTNER WITH OUR COUNTY COLLEAGUES. BUT WITH REGARDS TO THE WORK FORCE BEAST REALLY ASSESSING AND THINKING ABOUT. WIPED OUT CAPABILITIES TO OUR COUNTY COLLEAGUES HAVE NOW HOW DO WE- MAN OUT BY REDIRECTING INDIVIDUALS FROM OTHER AREAS OF COUNTY GOVERNMENT I WE ARE COMING FROM STATE GOVERNMENT- AND WE DIRECT FROM STATE GOVERNMENT. IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO EAT FIVE PARKER PASSED CITY IN ORDER TO HAVE THE SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO DO CONTACT TRACING AND SO WE'RE ACTIVELY WORKING WITH THAT WE ACTUALLY. ISSUED MAY ALL OUR LOCAL HEALTH JURISTIC STATE A BETTER AND- OF WHAT THE SCOPE OR THE GAP REALLY LOOKS LIKE AND- WE'LL HAVE SOME MORE INFORMATION IN THE COMING DAYS. AROUND WHAT HAVE GAP WERE REALLY TRYING TO FILL IN HOW WE CAN BE SUPPORT IT TO OUR LOCAL COLLEAGUES. AROUND CONTACT TRACING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT I AT AT THE STATE LEVEL AND THEN THE THIRD PIECE REALLY IS AROUND TECHNOLOGY AND I'M SURE YOU'LL HAVE PROBABLY BEEN BEEN INUNDATED JUST AS- YEAH. AROUND HAVE PRIVATE SECTOR COMPANIES IN TECHNOLOGY FIRMS THAT ARE COMING FORWARD SAYING THEY HAVE VARIOUS TOOLS AVAILABLE FOR CONTACT TRACING. AND THE WAY I THINK ABOUT THIS- WHEN WHERE WERE PRIORITY ENTICING OUR WORK IS INTO POCKETS WITH REGARDS TO TECHNOLOGY ONE IS THINKING ABOUT. I'M WE HELP AFFECT CRIME TRACER THE CONTACT INVESTIGATOR REALLY GET THE MOST INFORMATION IN ONE PLACE IN ORDER FOR THEM TO MORE RAPIDLY. CONTACT INDIVIDUALS. I IN ORDER. I A LADY I SET THAT WE SPREAD STOP SPREAD OF THE SO WHAT ARE THINGS WE CAN PUT TECHNOLOGY SOME. THAT KIND TRADE ARE IN ORDER FOR THEM BE ABLE TO DO THAT MORE. AND THEN THE SECOND PIECE IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY IS REALLY LOOKING AT SIX. SYMPTOM CHECK SO IN TV YOUR MEASLES A CONTACT TRACER WILL CONTACT YOU ONCE OR TWICE A DAY TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT I YOU HAD ANY SYMPTOMS AND RATHER THAN USING A CONTACT TRACER TO DO THAT. COULD WE PERHAPS THINK ABOUT THAT TECHNOLOGY OUT WHETHER THAT'S A TEXT MESSAGE OR AN APP WHERE YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO TELL. THE PUBLIC HEALTH OF OUR CONTACT TREE SERVICE WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAD SYMPTOMS OR NOT IF YOU HAVE THAT NOT THAT WOULD TRIGGER. ALL PERSONS ALL UP IBM'S CON. CALL OR BE A SO THAT'S OF HOW WE ARE LABOR WORKING ABOUT THAT NOW. I WOULD REGARDS TO COME. TRAY AND WE'RE DOING THAT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS BECAUSE IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. THAT AS WE LACK TAKE THE STICKING TECHNOLOGICAL ASPECTS THAT THE LINK OUT NOT DUPLICATE THE EFFORTS ON THE GROUND. AND EQUALLY IMPORTANT IT'S IT IS THAT THEY ALIGN WITH OUR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS. AT THE STATE AND COUNTY LEVELS SO THAT THOSE THINGS HAPPEN EQUALITY TO INTEGRATE AND TALK TO EACH OTHER SO THAT I WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO SURVEY. AND DETECT- THE OUTBREAK OR THE VIRUS I ONCE WE DO LAUGHTER MODIFY AND THE STATE ORDER I HOPE THAT. ARE HELPFUL. THANK YOU IS A BLOOM WAS I'M JUST GONNA- INTERRUPT ONE SECOND BRING YOU BACK OF MR GRAY HAD ONE QUESTION MANY OF THE LEAVE SO IF I COULD HAVE BEEN DAHLE ASK FOR YOUR INDULGENCE. FOR ONE FOUR STAR BUT THE- THANK YOU. CHAIRMAN THANK YOU TO MY- FROM MONICA ACTUAL FOR UP ON A QUESTION HE RAISED IN RESPECT PREVENTION AND EARLIER I MENTIONED- THE LEGISLATION I'VE WORKED ON. OUR AND HIS GLUCOSE MONITORS AND YOU KNOW FOR THREE YEARS RUNNING I INTRODUCED THAT LEGISLATION- AND FOR THREE YEARS RUNNING DEPARTMENT FINANCE SENT A LOT OF OPPOSITION. AND GIVEN THAT WE KNOW SEE GM'S REDUCE DIABETES RELATED HOSPITALIZATION BY. AS MUCH AS SEVEN FIVE PERCENT. AND GIVEN THAT DURING THE SURGE- AND COVERT NINETEEN WE'VE SEEN DIABETES RELATED HOSPITALIZATIONS ACCOUNT FOR AS MUCH AS THIRTY PERCENT. OF THE PROBLEM. IS IT FAIR TO SAY THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE WAS SHORT SIGHTED- IN ITS OPPOSITION TO MY LEGISLATION. ALL ONE OF OUR GREAT. ALL THIS IS ADAM DORSEY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO- YOU KNOW I THINK THE WAY THAT I WOULD LOOK AT THIS ISSUE- IS THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE A VALUE WAITED FOR A COUPLE YEARS NOW AND IT'S PART OF THE OVERALL CONTEXT OF ALL THE RESOURCE DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE AND SO- BUT WHILE WE AGREE THERE IS. YOU KNOW AT AT AT LEAST FOR CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORS AND A BENEFIT TO YOU PATIENTS- THERE'S ALSO A COST ASSOCIATED WITH IT AND IT HAS TO BE PRIORITIZED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THE DECISIONS THAT WERE MAKING AND SO. I THINK THAT'S JUST THE LANDS IN THE APPROACH THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE WITH THE WITH NOT ONLY THAT BUT WITH WHAT ALL. CAPTION AND YOU KNOW AT YOU EXPAND. ITS THERE IS A COST THERE'S ALSO BENEFIT AND SO. I'M HAVING TO CONSTANTLY WEIGH THESE WITH ALL OF THE OTHER. YOU KNOW POTENTIAL EXPANSIONS THAT'S THAT'S- SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO DO. I'LL GO AHEAD AND PUT THAT DOWN AS A YES AND- DOUBLE DOWN ON MY- YOU KNOW. SUPPORT FOR. MY COLLEGE POINT WHICH IS PREVENTION IS EXPENSIVE ON THE FRONT END BUT IT'S IMPORTANT AND WE'RE SEEING THE VERY REAL WORLD CONSEQUENCES. OF THAT ACTIVITY RIGHT NOW I ALSO WANNA JUST REAL QUICKLY TOUCH ON SOME ANSWERS YOU PROVIDE RECALLING FROM SANTA BARBARA IN RESPECT TO FEDERAL MONEY. AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IS NOT THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES POSITION THAT WERE. WAITING FOR THE CAVALRY TO ARRIVE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THE CAVALRY TO ARRIVE INFEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR DECADES. AND UNDER BOTH. DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATIONS WE- ADDITIONAL THAT. SLOT ACCREDITATION NURSING. IT HAS BEEN A CALL FINANCER. AND SO I HOPE ALTHOUGH I REALIZE IT'S DIFFICULT TO PRIORITIZE THESE DOLLARS DURING. A CRISIS LIKE THIS DURING ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IT IS NEVER BEEN. MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE DO. EXACTLY THAT AND I WANT TO FOLLOW UP WITH A QUESTION FOUR. OH YES AND FINANCE WE RAISE THIS LAST WEEK IN THIS COMMITTEE. THAT THE EIGHT TO NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN KERR'S ACT FUNDING THAT DID NOT GO DIRECTLY TO LARGE COUNTIES OF FIVE ONE THOUSAND MORE- I KNOW THE POSITION IS LAST WEEK OR NOT SURE HOW TO SPEND THAT I WANT TO REITERATE. THAT I BELIEVE THE- CALPERS AFTER SYSTEM SECTION BE AMENDED TO COVER AS MUCH AS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT- FOR THE SMALL COUNTIES SO THAT THAT FLEXIBLE PART OF MONEY. IS AVAILABLE TO DEAL WITH THESE NEAR TERM ISSUES AND AGAIN I WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE GOVERNOR- AND FINANCED ELSE IS PAYING INTO THE- TERM SMITH ON. THESE OTHER HELP ISSUES. THANK YOU GOODBYE BLOOM. THANK PASSING A NOTE TO MIKE DOWN THE OF. AT THANK YOU FOR THAT. COM OF MR GRAY I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT IF THE- WE DID A BETTER JOB OF UP PREVENTION AND- ONE WOULD HOPE THAT FEWER PEOPLE WOULD NEED THOSE CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORS BUT- I TAKE YOUR POINT. JUST RETURNING VERY QUICKLY TO CONTACT TRACING THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT A VERY THOROUGH DISCUSSION- AND I- WOULD ONLY EMPHASIZE THAT WE NEED THAT KIND OF- THOUGHTFUL DELIVERED EVAN SCIENCE BASED APPROACH. BOB TO- TO THIS ENTIRE ISSUE- OF TESTING WHETHER- IT'S BLOOD TESTING OR SEROLOGY TESTS OR- THE CONTACT TRACING- WE NEED TO HAVE THAT APPROACH LAID OUT AND VERY CLEAR AND WE NEED TO GET STARTED ON IT RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE WE REALLY CANNOT- OPEN UP THE ECONOMY. UNTIL WE HAVE THOSE THINGS IN PLACE I THINK THAT MUCH HAS BEEN- A VERY WELL ESTABLISHED AND- IN LITERATURE OUT THERE AND THE FOLKS WHO ARE- OUT THERE FIGURING OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET A PLACE% WHERE WE CAN RETURN TO GOOD ECONOMY THE WHAT. THE WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET THERE BY EIGHT JUST ARBITRARILY YOU KNOW OPENING UP THE BEACH IS LIKE- SOME COMMUNITIES TO LAST TO. LAST WEEK AND JOB OUT WE NEED TO HAVE MORE PLANNING AND MORE THOUGHTFULNESS AND THE- IN IN IN THE WAY WE DO THIS. AND I HOPE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO GET THERE SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. I UP. COUPLE OF QUICK POINTS. ABOUT CITIES AND UP AND ABOUT TRANSIT. HI I TRANSIT IS BEING VERY VERY HARD HIT AS IS EVERY OTHER SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY- AND- WE'RE NOT IT WOULD IF THE ABILITY TO GET FROM PLACE TO PLACE DOESN'T EXIST FOR THE WORK FORCE WHEN PEOPLE NEED TO COME BACK TO WORK. OF A WE HAVE AN UNDERLYING STRUCTURAL PROBLEM THAT TO- IS- IS GOING TO BE A DRAG ON THE ECONOMY SO I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO- AGAIN CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE BEING AS HARD HIT AS- AS THE AS THE STATUS IN SOME CASES ARE EVEN WORSE. AND I WANT TO URGE THE- ADMINISTRATION TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS- WE TALK ABOUT ONE ISSUE- LAST WEEK WITH THE- A SALES TAX REBATE FOR BUSINESSES IS A VERY WELL GROUNDED TO AND A GOOD IDEA AND IT'S GONNA BE VERY HELPFUL TO BUSINESS BUT IT HASN'T UNINTENDED IMPACT ON. ON ON LOCAL OMMUNITIES- AND THAT WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT WAS TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN THE ORIGINAL DECISION WAS MAKING OUT WITH MADE OF US A SIMILARLY I THINK THE- ARE THE FOR SENIORS. IS IN A GREAT PROGRAM- BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT TO A- ON THE OUR PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO BE ADMINISTERED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND- I WOULD URGE THE ADMINISTRATION TO GIVE THOUGHT TO- HOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO DO THAT. AT A TIME WHEN THEY ARE- IN VERY DEEP FINANCIAL DISTRESS THEMSELVES AND- OR IF YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT BUT- IT IT COULD BE JUST LEFT AS A COMMENT- AT AT THIS POINT IF THAT'S PREFERRED. YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE WILL DEFINITELY IT TAKE YOUR- FEEDBACK BACK I THINK THE ONE THING WILL SAY ON- THAT SUBJECT TO THE SENIOR MALES IS THAT OUR EXPECTATION IS THAT THAT THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE THAT WILL ACTUALLY BE PAID FOR BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. REGINA AND THE STATE WILL ALSO BE- PROVIDING SOME REIMBURSEMENT SO WHILE LOCALS WILL- HAVE SOME EXPENDITURE. IT WILL BE A SMALL PART OF THE OVERALL COST. OKAY WELL ON WORK- ANXIOUSLY AWAIT TO HEAR A MORE DETAILS ON THAT- WHEN IT COMES TO US SETTING GOALS I THINK ONE OF OUR GOALS OUGHT TO BE. THAT WE OF- NOT ALLOW THIS PANDEMIC TO BE. THE END OF THE MOM AND POP ECONOMY- WRIT LARGE WHETHER IT'S RESTAURANTS AND TO A SMALL MARKETS- OF A RETAIL OUTLETS- LANDLORDS WITH THE- WITH SMALL BUILDING SMALL. BUSINESS START UPS OF ACROSS THE BOARD. OF THE THAT IS BAD ROCK CALIFORNIA'S ITS- BEDROCK CUT. AMERICA AND WE REALLY CANNOT ALLOW THAT TO DISAPPEAR SO THAT SHE- DOES SOMETHING A LOT OF ATTENTION TO. I'M FINE I WANT TO THERE THERE WERE SOME COME ABOUT. OF THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AND I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT REGULATIONS AT NEVER BEEN CONSTRUCTED WITH INTENT TO STYMIE BUSINESS GROW CAL BROKE GROWTH. OF CALIFORNIA HAS REALLY BEEN AT THE LEAD OF SHOWING HOW OU CAN DEVELOP PUBLIC HEALTH REGULATIONS THAT PROTECT CALIFORNIANS AND STILL GROW THE CONOMY ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. AGO HERE TO UNDERSTAND THAT AND SO THE GOVERNOR CONTINUES TO HAVE A CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS. OF WE CANNOT ALLOW PUBLIC HEALTH TO TEND TO. NOT BE THE PRIMARY CONSIDERATION IN THE OVERALL APPROACH TO KEEPING OUR COMMUNITIES HEALTHY AB AND THRIVING ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE- THE MOST BURDEN TO THOSE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES I BEGAN BY- A SPEAKING ABOUT. A WHO ARE BURDENED BY POLLUTION- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR A- INDULGING ME FOR A FEW MOMENTS. AND THANK YOU MISTER MISTER BLOOM- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS DOCTOR WHAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- JUST- JUST A COUPLE POINTS- I THINK EARLIER- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BROKE BROUGHT UP THE CONCEPT OF UNIVERSAL PROTECTIONS AND- I MIGHT CHANGE THE PHRASE OF THAT A LITTLE BIT AND BECAUSE OF MY PROFESSION WE CALL UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS AND SO WE TREAT EVERYBODY AS IF THEY ARE POTENTIALLY INFECTIOUS REGARDLESS OF WHATEVER. AND THAT REALLY BEGAN- NGUYEN WITH THE ONSET OF THE HIV CRISIS AND SO WE ARE VERY CUSTOM TO TREATING EVERYBODY AS IF THEY ARE INFECTED BY WHO KNOWS WHAT AND SO I THINK- I THINK WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS THERE GOING TO BE SOME GUIDANCE ON WHAT UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS MIGHT BE LIKE FOR DIFFERENT SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY- BASED ON UPON THE RISK SO. AND YOU KNOW I'M JUST I JUST A LITTLE GOOGLE SEARCH HERE WITH REGARDS TO MISTER GRAY AND KING CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORS I THINK THEY COST ACCORDING WOULD GO. BETWEEN ABOUT FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS APIECE- THAT IS A- VERY VERY SMALL PRICE WHEN YOU CONSIDER WHAT IT COSTS FOR AN EMERGENCY ROOM VISIT- AND SO THAT'S WHEN WE TO ASK WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PREVENTION. YOU KNOW EMERGENCY ROOM BUSINESS COULD BE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS- FOR SOMEONE WHO MIGHT GOING TO HAVE A CRISIS AND- AND THAT COULD BE IT ALL SORTS OF COMPLICATIONS AROUND AROUND DIABETES SO WE HAVE A VERY VERY RICH. OF PHARMACEUTICALS FOR MEDI CAL POPULATION- RICHER THAN MANY COMMERCIAL PLANTS AND SO- IT IS A LITTLE BIT- MIND BOGGLING THAT ON THIS DEVICE WHICH IS MEDICARE COVERED AS WELL- WE CAN'T GET THIS WILL CROSS THE LINE SO ANYONE. THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. COMMENTS. OKAY THING I'M NOT I WAS GONNA GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT I SEE ONE ONE PERSON FOR PUBLIC IN PERSON COMMENT THAT WILL GO TO THE PHONE LINE. PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN- JOHN LEVEL REPRESENTING A NUMBER OF CLIENTS I'D USE UP MY MINUTE IF I WENT THROUGH THE MOBILE EVERYONE WAS CONCERNED- I WANTED TO. HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THINGS AT THIS HEARING THAT I THINK DESERVE. EXTRAORDINARY ATTENTION- DOCTOR WOODS SENSE OF URGENCY ON PPVS- I THINK SHOULD BE EMBRACED BY EVERYONE BECAUSE IT IS REALLY A MARRIAGE OF SMART. ECONOMY DEVELOPMENT AGAIN- AND ALSO HEALTH CARE- THE FACT IS THAT HIS DOCTOR WOULD SAID THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF PROFESSIONS THAT DEPEND ON PPVS AND THAT URGENCY IS GROWN- AND- ITHINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE STATE. SHOULD FOCUS ON- TOWARD REBUILDING THE ECONOMY AND- PROTECTING THE HEALTH OF THAT- REBUILDING- SO THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO FOCUS ON I WOULD ALSO CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE BLUE NEED NEW DEAL- COMMENTS OF MISTER GRAY I THINK THOSE ARE WORTHY OF- FOR THE- HIM BRACING AS WELL GREAT HEARING AGAIN JUST UNDER.
