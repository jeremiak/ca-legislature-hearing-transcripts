WITH THEIR DAILY ACTIVITIES.

00:24:17.056 --> 00:24:19.792 region:rollup2
FORTY TWO PERCENT FOR PEOPLE WHO

00:24:18.223 --> 00:24:22.027 region:rollup2
ARE PARTICIPATING IN MAJOR

00:24:19.792 --> 00:24:23.395 region:rollup2
PUBLIC PROGRAMS AND BAD THINGS

00:24:22.027 --> 00:24:24.363 region:rollup2
HAPPEN TO PEOPLE WHEN THEY DON'T

GET ALL THE HELP THEY NEED FOR

00:24:24.363 --> 00:24:26.732 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE.

00:24:25.698 --> 00:24:28.734 region:rollup2
THEY TAKE THE WRONG MEDICATIONS

00:24:26.732 --> 00:24:31.270 region:rollup2
ARE DON'T TAKE THEIR MEDICATION.

00:24:28.734 --> 00:24:32.938 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE TOSTAY IN BED OR AT

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:34.139 region:rollup2
HOME BECAUSE NOBODY IS THERE TO

00:24:32.938 --> 00:24:35.874 region:rollup2
HELP THEM GET OUT AND

00:24:34.139 --> 00:24:37.576 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IN SOMETHING. THEY

00:24:35.874 --> 00:24:40.379 region:rollup2
DON'T GET TO THE TOILET ON TIME

00:24:37.576 --> 00:24:42.081 region:rollup2
THEY END UP ON IN CLOTHES THAT

00:24:40.379 --> 00:24:44.783 region:rollup2
ARE SOIL THEY DON'T EAT THE FOOD

00:24:42.081 --> 00:24:47.186 region:rollup2
THEY NEED AND IT HAPPENS A LOT.

00:24:44.783 --> 00:24:48.454 region:rollup2
SO.

00:24:47.186 --> 00:24:49.988 region:rollup2
THE OTHER MAIN THING THAT WE

00:24:48.454 --> 00:24:51.090 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW IS Y. PEOPLE ARE NOT

00:24:49.988 --> 00:24:52.257 region:rollup2
GETTING THE HELP THEY NEED WE

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:53.092 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE BARRIERS ARE

00:24:52.257 --> 00:24:54.626 region:rollup2
AND IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

00:24:53.092 --> 00:24:55.761 region:rollup2
BARRIERS ARE WE CAN'T SOLVE IT

00:24:54.626 --> 00:24:57.363 region:rollup2
SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

00:24:55.761 --> 00:24:59.031 region:rollup2
SOLUTION IS FOR EXAMPLE.

00:24:57.363 --> 00:25:00.1000 region:rollup2
ONE OF THESUPPORTS THAT FAMILY

00:24:59.031 --> 00:25:02.267 region:rollup2
CAREGIVERS NEED SO THAT THEY CAN

00:25:00.1000 --> 00:25:03.302 region:rollup2
KEEP DOING WHAT THEY DO AND DO

IT BETTER AND MORE EFFICIENTLY.

00:25:03.302 --> 00:25:06.939 region:rollup2
WE DON'T KNOW THAT

00:25:05.037 --> 00:25:08.273 region:rollup2
WE DON'T KNOW EITHER ALTERNATIVE

00:25:06.939 --> 00:25:10.009 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS IS THERE SOMETHING WE

00:25:08.273 --> 00:25:10.909 region:rollup2
COULD DO A PROGRAM WE COULD

00:25:10.009 --> 00:25:12.177 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT THAT WOULD BE

00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:13.579 region:rollup2

00:25:13.579 --> 00:25:16.448 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT TO HELP PEOPLE WHO

GET THAT AT NOT SOME HUGE AMOUNT

00:25:18.217 --> 00:25:21.620 region:rollup2
OF OF COST.

WE DON'T IF THERE'S SOME

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:25.124 region:rollup2
PRIVATE SOLUTION LIKE MAKING

WANT.

00:25:26.692 --> 00:25:29.695 region:rollup2
AND COULD AFFORD AND I'VE MET

00:25:28.827 --> 00:25:31.196 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS IS WE

00:25:29.695 --> 00:25:32.865 region:rollup2

00:53:41.051 --> 00:53:44.154 region:rollup2
PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR CONTINUOUS

00:53:42.453 --> 00:53:45.422 region:rollup2
GLUCOSE MONITORS.

00:53:44.154 --> 00:53:45.989 region:rollup2
WHEN MEDICALLY NECESSARY FOR THE

00:53:45.422 --> 00:53:48.158 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT AND TREATMENT OF

00:53:48.158 --> 00:53:51.562 region:rollup2
THE PROPOSAL.

00:53:49.927 --> 00:53:53.397 region:rollup2
MAY LOOK FAMILIAR AS IT IS

00:53:51.562 --> 00:53:55.866 region:rollup2
IDENTICAL TO A BILL I CARRIED

00:53:53.397 --> 00:53:57.501 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR A. B. FOR FORTY SEVEN.

00:53:55.866 --> 00:53:59.803 region:rollup2
WHICH WOULD HAVE SOUGHT TO

00:53:57.501 --> 00:54:01.138 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISH THE EXACT SAME.

00:53:59.803 --> 00:54:03.674 region:rollup2
THE BILL RECEIVED UNANIMOUS BY

00:54:01.138 --> 00:54:05.309 region:rollup2
PORTERS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN

00:54:03.674 --> 00:54:06.677 region:rollup2
BOTH HOUSES THE LEGISLATURE. BUT

00:54:05.309 --> 00:54:08.245 region:rollup2
WAS ULTIMATELY VETOED BY THE

00:54:06.677 --> 00:54:09.913 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR BECAUSE G. H. C. S.

00:54:08.245 --> 00:54:11.715 region:rollup2
ALREADY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO

00:54:09.913 --> 00:54:14.251 region:rollup2
COVER CGM.

00:54:11.715 --> 00:54:15.919 region:rollup2
AND IF THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO.

00:54:14.251 --> 00:54:17.254 region:rollup2
SINCE THAT TIME DEPARTMENTS

00:54:15.919 --> 00:54:18.789 region:rollup2
CONTINUOUS CERTAIN THAT THEY ARE

00:54:17.254 --> 00:54:20.758 region:rollup2
CRAFTING GUIDELINES

00:54:18.789 --> 00:54:21.325 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SEE GEMS AVAILABLE FOR

00:54:20.758 --> 00:54:22.593 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL PATIENTS THAT NEED

00:54:21.325 --> 00:54:24.495 region:rollup2
THEM.

00:54:22.593 --> 00:54:26.096 region:rollup2
WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING THAT SHE

00:54:24.495 --> 00:54:26.663 region:rollup2
JAMS ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE FOR

00:54:26.096 --> 00:54:28.632 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL PATIENTS THAT NEED

00:54:26.663 --> 00:54:30.934 region:rollup2
THEM.

00:54:28.632 --> 00:54:32.136 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.

00:54:30.934 --> 00:54:33.570 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT MAINTAINS THAT THIS

00:54:32.136 --> 00:54:35.139 region:rollup2
CHANGE WILL GIVE MEDICARE

00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:37.241 region:rollup2
PATIENTS ACCESS TO SEE GM

00:54:35.139 --> 00:54:39.643 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THE NEED TO MAKE CGM A

00:54:37.241 --> 00:54:41.945 region:rollup2
COVERED BENEFIT.

00:54:39.643 --> 00:54:43.814 region:rollup2
AGAIN WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE.

00:54:41.945 --> 00:54:45.182 region:rollup2
WHY WON'T DHS MAKERS SEE GEMMA

00:54:43.814 --> 00:54:46.650 region:rollup2
COVERED BENEFIT IF THEY WANT TO

00:54:45.182 --> 00:54:47.818 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THE TECHNOLOGY IS

00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:49.787 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE TO ALL?

00:54:47.818 --> 00:54:51.822 region:rollup2
OF THOSE THAT NEED.

00:54:49.787 --> 00:54:53.524 region:rollup2
THE REALITY IS.

00:54:51.822 --> 00:54:54.758 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM IS MADE IT AS HARD

00:54:53.524 --> 00:54:56.794 region:rollup2
AS POSSIBLE TO THE MEDI CAL

00:54:54.758 --> 00:54:58.061 region:rollup2
PATIENTS TO ACCESS HE JAMS SO

00:54:56.794 --> 00:54:59.930 region:rollup2
THAT THEY CAN SAY ALL THE RIGHT

00:54:58.061 --> 00:55:02.099 region:rollup2
THINGS WHILE CREATING A DE FACTO

00:54:59.930 --> 00:55:03.767 region:rollup2
BAN ON COVERAGE.

00:55:02.099 --> 00:55:06.503 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT SO COMMITTED TO THIS

00:55:03.767 --> 00:55:08.672 region:rollup2
STRATEGY MACHINE CHAIR THAT.

00:55:06.503 --> 00:55:10.607 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR AT THE VERY SAME TIME

00:55:08.672 --> 00:55:12.276 region:rollup2
THAT I WAS RUNNING MY BILL THEY

00:55:10.607 --> 00:55:13.977 region:rollup2
UNILATERALLY OVERRULED AND

00:55:12.276 --> 00:55:15.212 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE

00:55:13.977 --> 00:55:15.813 region:rollup2
WHO REJECTED THEIR INITIAL

00:55:15.212 --> 00:55:17.514 region:rollup2
DECISION TO DIE COVERAGE FOR A

00:55:15.813 --> 00:55:18.849 region:rollup2
PATIENT.

00:55:17.514 --> 00:55:20.884 region:rollup2
SO PATIENTS ARE COVERAGE A

00:55:18.849 --> 00:55:22.586 region:rollup2

WITH THE PATIENT

00:55:25.656 --> 00:55:28.358 region:rollup2
AND THE DEPARTMENT CAME AND USE

00:55:27.157 --> 00:55:32.029 region:rollup2
THE UNILATERAL AUTHORITY TO

00:55:28.358 --> 00:55:33.564 region:rollup2
REVERSE THAT DECISION.

00:55:32.029 --> 00:55:35.299 region:rollup2
MEMBERS TWO POINT THREE MILLION

00:55:33.564 --> 00:55:36.400 region:rollup2

MEDICARE.

00:55:38.001 --> 00:55:40.771 region:rollup2
THE RATE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS

00:55:39.303 --> 00:55:41.805 region:rollup2
WITH DIABETES IS DOUBLE THAT OF

00:55:40.771 --> 00:55:43.674 region:rollup2
THOSE WITH EMPLOYER SPONSORED

EVERY COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLAN IN

NINETY PERCENT OF MANAGED CARE

00:55:59.523 --> 00:56:03.193 region:rollup2

00:56:07.865 --> 00:56:10.334 region:rollup2
CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MYERS ARE

00:56:08.932 --> 00:56:11.902 region:rollup2

TOOL AT OUR DISPOSAL TO MENTION

00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:17.241 region:rollup2
STANDARD OF CARE FOR EVERY OTHER

00:56:15.172 --> 00:56:19.309 region:rollup2
PATIENT POPULATION CALIFORNIA

00:56:17.241 --> 00:56:20.277 region:rollup2
EXCEPT THOSE ON MEDICARE.

00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:21.645 region:rollup2
WHO IN MANY INSTANCES OF THE

00:56:20.277 --> 00:56:23.714 region:rollup2
MOST IN NEED OF THIS CRITICAL

00:56:21.645 --> 00:56:24.982 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY?

00:56:23.714 --> 00:56:26.683 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLANS ARE NOT

00:56:24.982 --> 00:56:28.352 region:rollup2
REQUIRED BY LAW TO COVER THESE

00:56:26.683 --> 00:56:29.720 region:rollup2
DEVICES AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT

00:56:28.352 --> 00:56:30.287 region:rollup2
THEY CERTAINLY ARE NOT COVERING

00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:32.322 region:rollup2
THEM OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF

00:56:30.287 --> 00:56:33.957 region:rollup2
THEIR HEARTS.

00:56:32.322 --> 00:56:35.259 region:rollup2
THEY'RE COVERING CGM BECAUSE

00:56:33.957 --> 00:56:36.326 region:rollup2
THAT RESULTS IN BETTER HEALTH

00:56:35.259 --> 00:56:37.828 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES FOR THE PATIENT

00:56:36.326 --> 00:56:39.196 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS REDUCES

00:56:37.828 --> 00:56:41.231 region:rollup2
COMPLICATIONS RESULTING IN

00:56:39.196 --> 00:56:43.100 region:rollup2
HOSPITALIZATION AND ULTIMATELY

00:56:41.231 --> 00:56:44.368 region:rollup2
SAVES THE PLANTS MONEY.

00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:45.969 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA COULD BENEFIT FROM

00:56:44.368 --> 00:56:47.404 region:rollup2
THE SAME COST SAVING SEVENTY

00:56:45.969 --> 00:56:48.772 region:rollup2
FIVE PERCENT OF THE COST OF

00:56:47.404 --> 00:56:49.973 region:rollup2

TAXPAYER.

00:56:51.441 --> 00:56:55.479 region:rollup2
SO EVEN A MODEST REDUCTION IN

00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:56.680 region:rollup2
HOSPITALIZATIONS WOULD SEE THE

00:56:55.479 --> 00:56:58.081 region:rollup2
STATE COME OUT AHEAD FINANCIALLY

00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:59.783 region:rollup2

MAKE DETERMINATIONS BASED UPON

01:15:39.668 --> 01:15:43.272 region:rollup2
MEDICAL NECESSITY THERE ARE

01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:45.975 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ABOUT INDIVIDUALS THAT

AGE OUT OF THE CCS PROGRAM. THAT

01:15:52.248 --> 01:15:55.751 region:rollup2
HOW IT THOSE SERVICES BE COVERED

01:15:53.916 --> 01:15:57.953 region:rollup2

WOULD BE PAR AUTHORIZED. AND

01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:04.760 region:rollup2
THEN THAT REQUEST WILL COME INTO

01:16:03.192 --> 01:16:06.495 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT WITH THE

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:08.831 region:rollup2
DOCUMENTATION TO DEMONSTRATE

01:16:06.495 --> 01:16:11.100 region:rollup2
MEDICAL NECESSITY. BECAUSE IT'S

01:16:08.831 --> 01:16:12.268 region:rollup2
A NON COVERED BENEFIT TODAY IT

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:14.003 region:rollup2
IS LIKELY THAT THERE ARE

01:16:12.268 --> 01:16:15.571 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS UNDER THE MEDICAL

01:16:14.003 --> 01:16:17.339 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT HAVE NOT RECEIVED

01:16:15.571 --> 01:16:19.308 region:rollup2
THIS BENEFIT. BUT AGAIN WE'RE

01:16:17.339 --> 01:16:21.677 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN

01:16:19.308 --> 01:16:22.111 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THAT THROUGH.

01:16:21.677 --> 01:16:23.813 region:rollup2
.

01:16:22.111 --> 01:16:26.482 region:rollup2
CLEAR DIRECTIONSFOR HOW TO

MEDICAL PROGRAM AND WE HAVE NOT.

01:16:30.619 --> 01:16:33.923 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AGAIN THAT THE WAY IT'S

01:16:32.087 --> 01:16:36.459 region:rollup2
ADMINISTERED UNDER OUR PROGRAM

01:16:33.923 --> 01:16:37.927 region:rollup2

AUTHORIZED.

01:16:40.796 --> 01:16:44.366 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING I DID WANT TO

01:16:42.131 --> 01:16:45.935 region:rollup2
MAKE MENTION OF.

01:16:44.366 --> 01:16:48.070 region:rollup2
IS THAT WITH THE MEDICAL

01:16:45.935 --> 01:16:50.439 region:rollup2

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:52.408 region:rollup2
PERCENT ARE ON MANAGE THROUGH

01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:54.176 region:rollup2
MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS SO

01:16:52.408 --> 01:16:55.211 region:rollup2
OUR MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PLANS

01:16:54.176 --> 01:16:57.746 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S NOT HE COVERED

01:16:55.211 --> 01:16:59.248 region:rollup2
BENEFIT. DO HAVE THE ABILITY

01:16:57.746 --> 01:17:01.150 region:rollup2
SHOULD THEY DESIRE TO MAKE THIS

01:16:59.248 --> 01:17:03.185 region:rollup2
BENEFIT AVAILABLE TO THE

01:17:01.150 --> 01:17:04.286 region:rollup2
BENEFICIARIES THAT THEY SERVE

01:17:03.185 --> 01:17:07.156 region:rollup2
BUT THEY DO HAVE AT THEIR

01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:08.924 region:rollup2
DISPOSAL. THE ABILITY TO MANAGE

01:17:07.156 --> 01:17:10.793 region:rollup2

CONDITIONS INCLUDING DIABETES

01:17:13.095 --> 01:17:16.232 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE WAS A QUESTION

01:17:14.196 --> 01:17:17.533 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOSPITALIZATIONS AND SO.

01:17:16.232 --> 01:17:18.701 region:rollup2
THAT'S KIND OF THE CORNERSTONE

01:17:17.533 --> 01:17:20.803 region:rollup2
OF THE WORK THAT MEDICARE

01:17:18.701 --> 01:17:23.005 region:rollup2

.

01:17:35.451 --> 01:17:37.253 region:rollup2
THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF THAT

01:17:36.418 --> 01:17:38.154 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:17:37.253 --> 01:17:39.889 region:rollup2
I'M STRUGGLING WITH BUT.

EIGHTEEN AND IS NO LONGER

01:18:37.012 --> 01:18:40.516 region:rollup2
COVERED WITH CCS.

01:18:38.914 --> 01:18:41.784 region:rollup2
PEOPLE OF TYPE ONE DIABETES

01:18:40.516 --> 01:18:43.285 region:rollup2
DON'T AGE OUT OF TYPE ONE

01:18:41.784 --> 01:18:45.988 region:rollup2
DIABETES.

01:18:43.285 --> 01:18:47.923 region:rollup2
SO WHY WOULD THEY HAVE TO THEN

01:18:45.988 --> 01:18:49.892 region:rollup2
GO TO ANOTHER PROCESS.

01:18:47.923 --> 01:18:51.660 region:rollup2
TO ASSIST TO ASCERTAIN THE

01:18:49.892 --> 01:18:53.395 region:rollup2
MEDICAL NECESSITY FOR THE DEVICE

01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:54.763 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'VE BEEN USING. UNDER

01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:56.732 region:rollup2
THE CCS PROGRAM I DON'T

01:18:54.763 --> 01:18:58.367 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT SO BECAUSE OF

01:18:56.732 --> 01:18:59.935 region:rollup2
THE WAY THE BENEFIT IS COVERED

01:18:58.367 --> 01:19:02.471 region:rollup2
TODAY SOMEONE AT THE NON COVERED

01:18:59.935 --> 01:19:04.740 region:rollup2
BENEFIT ABOUT WHEN WE LOOK AT.

01:19:02.471 --> 01:19:06.675 region:rollup2
CGM IT WOULD BE CONSIDERED A

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:07.977 region:rollup2
DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND

01:19:06.675 --> 01:19:09.778 region:rollup2
FOR MOST DURABLE MEDICAL

01:19:07.977 --> 01:19:11.347 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT THAT IS COVERED BY THE

01:19:09.778 --> 01:19:13.048 region:rollup2
MEDIC CAO PROGRAM. PAR

01:19:11.347 --> 01:19:15.551 region:rollup2
AUTHORIZATION IS REQUIRED SO

01:19:13.048 --> 01:19:17.820 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST THE SUBSTANTIATION AND

01:19:15.551 --> 01:19:19.154 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE SEEN. WHEN INDIVIDUALS

01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:21.390 region:rollup2
ARE COVERED UNDER THE MATTER HOW

01:19:19.154 --> 01:19:23.425 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WHEN THEY ARE UNDER THE

01:19:21.390 --> 01:19:25.527 region:rollup2
AGE OF TWENTY ONE AS A CHILD

01:19:23.425 --> 01:19:27.529 region:rollup2
THEY ARE CONSIDERED. I'M

01:19:25.527 --> 01:19:29.732 region:rollup2
ELIGIBLE UNDER WHAT WE CALL E.

01:19:27.529 --> 01:19:31.166 region:rollup2
PIASKI T. EARLY PERIODIC

01:19:29.732 --> 01:19:33.469 region:rollup2
SCREENING DIAGNOSIS.

01:19:31.166 --> 01:19:34.970 region:rollup2
AND TREATMENT SERVICES SO THOSE

01:19:33.469 --> 01:19:36.939 region:rollup2
SERVICES HAVE AN EXPANDED

01:19:34.970 --> 01:19:39.942 region:rollup2
MEDICAL NECESSITY REQUIREMENT

01:19:36.939 --> 01:19:41.810 region:rollup2
THAT IS NOT THE SAME FOR ADULTS

01:19:39.942 --> 01:19:43.312 region:rollup2
ONCE THEY EIGHT OUT OF. BEING

01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:45.147 region:rollup2
TWENTY ONE AMBIEN AT BEING

01:19:43.312 --> 01:19:46.882 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED A CHILD UNDER THE

01:19:45.147 --> 01:19:48.751 region:rollup2
MEDICAL PROGRAM SO THERE'S A

01:19:46.882 --> 01:19:51.920 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT STANDARD OF MEDICAL

01:19:48.751 --> 01:19:54.390 region:rollup2
NECESSITY BUT AS AN ADULT WE DO

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:55.991 region:rollup2
LOOK AT. WHAT WAS SAPE

01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:57.459 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY APPROVED AND THEN

01:19:55.991 --> 01:19:59.528 region:rollup2
BASED UPON WHAT'S COVERED UNDER

01:19:57.459 --> 01:20:00.996 region:rollup2
OUR PROGRAM FOR A IN THIS

01:19:59.528 --> 01:20:03.032 region:rollup2
INSTANCE IF IT'S AMONG COVERED

01:20:00.996 --> 01:20:05.668 region:rollup2
BENEFIT? AGAIN WE WOULD LOOK AT

01:20:03.032 --> 01:20:07.302 region:rollup2
THE SUBSTANTIATION OF SAY PRIOR

01:20:05.668 --> 01:20:08.704 region:rollup2
NEED AND THEN USE THAT

01:20:07.302 --> 01:20:10.906 region:rollup2
INFORMATION TO THEM MAKE A

01:20:08.704 --> 01:20:12.207 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION OF ONGOING MEDICAL

01:20:10.906 --> 01:20:13.242 region:rollup2
NECESSITY.

01:20:12.207 --> 01:20:13.542 region:rollup2
SO THEN I GUESS MY FINAL

01:20:13.242 --> 01:20:15.444 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS.

01:20:13.542 --> 01:20:17.413 region:rollup2
.

01:20:15.444 --> 01:20:19.081 region:rollup2
WHITE Y. SCOUT IS SO MANY OTHER

01:20:17.413 --> 01:20:20.683 region:rollup2
STATES HAVE THIS IS PART OF THE

01:20:19.081 --> 01:20:22.284 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AND THEIR PROGRAMS WHY

01:20:20.683 --> 01:20:23.786 region:rollup2
WHITE Y. WHEAT Y. WE NOT DOING

01:20:22.284 --> 01:20:24.953 region:rollup2
THIS WE SPEND SO MUCH MONEY ON

01:20:23.786 --> 01:20:27.189 region:rollup2
TREATMENT.

01:20:24.953 --> 01:20:28.657 region:rollup2
AND INSTEAD OF PREVENTING SOME

01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:30.592 region:rollup2
OF THE EPISODES THAT DRIVE

01:20:28.657 --> 01:20:32.227 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO EMERGENCY ROOMS THAT

01:20:30.592 --> 01:20:34.063 region:rollup2
BRING OUT FIRST RESPONDERS.

01:20:32.227 --> 01:20:36.098 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT WHAT AM I MISSING HERE

01:20:34.063 --> 01:20:37.900 region:rollup2
WHITE WHAT? WHY IT WHY ARE WE

01:20:36.098 --> 01:20:39.601 region:rollup2
NOT INVESTING IN THESE THESE

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:40.636 region:rollup2
KINDS OF DEVICES THAT CAN REALLY

01:20:39.601 --> 01:20:42.371 region:rollup2
HELP PEOPLE THEIR QUALITY OF

01:20:40.636 --> 01:20:43.972 region:rollup2
LIFE AND SAVE US MONEY ON THE

01:20:42.371 --> 01:20:45.641 region:rollup2
OTHER END I'M I'M? A MISSING

01:20:43.972 --> 01:20:48.043 region:rollup2
SOMETHING HELP ME UNDERSTAND SO

01:20:45.641 --> 01:20:50.212 region:rollup2
I THINK PART OF IT IS LOOKING AT

01:20:48.043 --> 01:20:51.413 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE'S MANY DEVICES

01:20:50.212 --> 01:20:53.082 region:rollup2
THAT ARE OUT THERE IN THE

01:20:51.413 --> 01:20:55.117 region:rollup2
MEDICAL COMMUNITY WE IS THE

01:20:53.082 --> 01:20:57.019 region:rollup2
PROGRAM BECAUSE IT IS A PUBLICLY

01:20:55.117 --> 01:21:00.556 region:rollup2
FINANCED PROGRAM. WE'RE LOOKING

01:20:57.019 --> 01:21:01.924 region:rollup2
AT THOSE DEVICES THAT ARE MADE

01:21:00.556 --> 01:21:03.425 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS.

01:21:01.924 --> 01:21:05.160 region:rollup2
SEE THAT HAS BEEN DETERMINED

01:21:03.425 --> 01:21:07.696 region:rollup2
BASED UPON SAY PEER REVIEWED

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:09.398 region:rollup2
JOURNALS EVIDENCE BASED MEDICINE

01:21:07.696 --> 01:21:11.633 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS SOMETHING AGAIN

LEGISLATION LIKE THIS CREATING

01:30:31.059 --> 01:30:35.430 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM A CURRENT STATUTE THE

MANY YEARS. BUT THE PARALLEL

01:30:39.334 --> 01:30:43.138 region:rollup2
EXTENDS THE FACT THAT WE KNEW

01:30:41.736 --> 01:30:44.339 region:rollup2
WITH PEOPLE NOW UNLESS IT'S

01:30:43.138 --> 01:30:46.007 region:rollup2

A MONTH.

01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:01.323 region:rollup2

THAT'S LEFT OVER THAT DOESN'T

01:43:47.555 --> 01:43:51.392 region:rollup2
HAVE A CLEAR DIAGNOSIS WE STILL

SUSPECTED.

01:43:57.898 --> 01:44:00.534 region:rollup2

WILL MEAN FOR CHILDREN LATER IN

01:44:19.253 --> 01:44:24.158 region:rollup2
THEIR LIVES WE ONLY I'D TRY TO

01:44:21.956 --> 01:44:26.427 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY THE REASON WHY THAT

01:44:24.158 --> 01:44:27.962 region:rollup2
PATIENT IS SICK RIGHT NOW. WE

01:44:26.427 --> 01:44:28.996 region:rollup2
DON'T ANALYZE FOR IF THERE IS AN

01:44:27.962 --> 01:44:30.531 region:rollup2
INCREASED CHANCE THAT THEY'LL

01:44:28.996 --> 01:44:31.932 region:rollup2
GET BREAST CANCER WHEN THEY'RE

I ONLY HAVE ONE QUESTION IF IF

01:46:23.911 --> 01:46:27.114 region:rollup2
I MAY DOING.

01:46:25.846 --> 01:46:28.716 region:rollup2
WORKING A LITTLE BIT OF MATH

01:46:27.114 --> 01:46:30.651 region:rollup2
WHILE I WAS HERE BUT. FOR TWO

01:46:28.716 --> 01:46:32.219 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS AND ONE HUNDRED

01:46:30.651 --> 01:46:35.422 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT'S TWENTY THOUSAND

01:46:32.219 --> 01:46:35.789 region:rollup2
DOLLARS PER GENOMIC SEQUENCING.

01:46:35.422 --> 01:46:37.825 region:rollup2
AND.

01:46:35.789 --> 01:46:40.628 region:rollup2
MINDER STANDING IS THAT

01:46:37.825 --> 01:46:42.363 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY IS NOW MORE COST

01:46:40.628 --> 01:46:43.998 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE THAN THAT FIGURE AND

01:46:42.363 --> 01:46:44.632 region:rollup2
SONG TRYING TO.

01:46:43.998 --> 01:46:46.066 region:rollup2
WONDER.

01:46:44.632 --> 01:46:47.868 region:rollup2
.

01:46:46.066 --> 01:46:49.570 region:rollup2
IS THERE.

01:46:47.868 --> 01:46:52.006 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT STATE

01:46:49.570 --> 01:46:52.473 region:rollup2
DOLLARS ARE PAYING THE ACTUAL

01:46:52.006 --> 01:46:54.441 region:rollup2
PRICE FOR THE GENOMIC

01:46:52.473 --> 01:46:55.276 region:rollup2
SEQUENCING?

01:46:54.441 --> 01:46:56.910 region:rollup2
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOU GOT

01:46:55.276 --> 01:46:58.879 region:rollup2
TO TWO MILLION DOLLARS.

01:46:56.910 --> 01:47:01.148 region:rollup2
YEAH BUT SO.

01:46:58.879 --> 01:47:02.983 region:rollup2
THE REPORTER QUESTION SO.

01:47:01.148 --> 01:47:04.318 region:rollup2
TO BE CLEAR WAS TOLD UNITS

01:47:02.983 --> 01:47:05.519 region:rollup2
SEQUENCING HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY

01:47:04.318 --> 01:47:07.421 region:rollup2
REDUCING COST IT IS

01:47:05.519 --> 01:47:09.356 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPENSIVE TO

01:47:07.421 --> 01:47:10.090 region:rollup2
DO A RAPID JEAN OF TRENTON

01:47:09.356 --> 01:47:11.926 region:rollup2
RESULT ROUNDED THREE TO FOUR

01:47:10.090 --> 01:47:13.294 region:rollup2
DAYS. RATHER THAN A MONTH OR TWO

01:47:11.926 --> 01:47:15.696 region:rollup2
MONTHS BECAUSE IT'S RENTS HAVE

01:47:13.294 --> 01:47:17.531 region:rollup2
KILLED MICE FOR SPEED PROBLEM

01:47:15.696 --> 01:47:18.599 region:rollup2
COSTS ABOUT ONE POINT.

01:47:17.531 --> 01:47:19.667 region:rollup2
SECOND ONE WHICH I THINK IS

01:47:18.599 --> 01:47:21.168 region:rollup2
PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANT THAT

01:47:19.667 --> 01:47:21.769 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GETTING A DIAGNOSIS ON

01:47:21.168 --> 01:47:23.170 region:rollup2
A GENOME IS ONLY THE BEGINNING

01:47:21.769 --> 01:47:24.171 region:rollup2
OF THE JOURNEY.

01:47:23.170 --> 01:47:25.639 region:rollup2
AND IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR

01:47:24.171 --> 01:47:26.974 region:rollup2
GENETICALLY AND FORMATS AND TO

01:47:25.639 --> 01:47:27.975 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT THE TIME TO ACTUALLY

01:47:26.974 --> 01:47:30.444 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF CHANGES IN

01:47:27.975 --> 01:47:31.779 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT.

01:47:30.444 --> 01:47:33.847 region:rollup2

THEY HAVE GOOD GENETICS

01:47:35.049 --> 01:47:38.218 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENTS ON BUT DON'T

01:47:36.784 --> 01:47:41.188 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY HAVE THE PENALTY ON

01:47:38.218 --> 01:47:42.856 region:rollup2
THE FLIGHT TO. RESPOND TO JIM

01:47:41.188 --> 01:47:43.924 region:rollup2
RESULT AS CURRENTLY SIGN UP.

01:47:42.856 --> 01:47:45.192 region:rollup2
THERE IS A NEED TO PROVIDE

01:47:43.924 --> 01:47:47.394 region:rollup2
GENETIC COUNSELING IN THE NECK

01:47:45.192 --> 01:47:48.929 region:rollup2
IS OUT THOSE INSTITUTIONS WHICH

01:47:47.394 --> 01:47:49.663 region:rollup2
REQUIRES PERSONAL TO DO THAT.

01:47:48.929 --> 01:47:51.098 region:rollup2
AND FURTHERMORE THE COST

01:47:49.663 --> 01:47:52.933 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS IN AND OF ITSELF IS

01:47:51.098 --> 01:47:54.268 region:rollup2
VERY LABOR INTENSIVE TO REVIEW

01:47:52.933 --> 01:47:54.735 region:rollup2
THROUGH MEDICAL RECORDS. AND TO

01:47:54.268 --> 01:47:57.137 region:rollup2
DEVELOP WHAT WE CALL

01:47:54.735 --> 01:47:58.272 region:rollup2

TRAJECTORIES THAT'S TO SAY.

01:47:58.272 --> 01:48:00.174 region:rollup2
TRYING TO ESTABLISH WHAT WOULD

HAVE HAPPENED IN A RARE DISEASE

01:48:00.174 --> 01:48:02.609 region:rollup2
SITUATION IF WE HADN'T DONE THE

02:08:22.762 --> 02:08:25.998 region:rollup2
CALF NOON CHAIR MEMBERS OF PRE

02:08:24.630 --> 02:08:27.867 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENCE FUNDS ARE WITH THE

02:08:25.998 --> 02:08:29.368 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION.

02:08:27.867 --> 02:08:30.636 region:rollup2
I WANTED JUST SAM KEEP MY

02:08:29.368 --> 02:08:31.971 region:rollup2
COMMENTS DIRECTLY TO THE

02:08:30.636 --> 02:08:33.339 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX.

02:08:31.971 --> 02:08:34.240 region:rollup2
DONE THE COUNCILMEN ALL

02:08:33.339 --> 02:08:35.808 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS.

02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:37.577 region:rollup2
I MEAN SPECIFICALLY OUT FOR THAT

02:08:35.808 --> 02:08:38.110 region:rollup2
AND THE NEW MONEY THAT HAS IN

02:08:37.577 --> 02:08:40.046 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE

02:08:38.110 --> 02:08:40.613 region:rollup2
SEVENTY MILLION. I'M WE REALLY

02:08:40.046 --> 02:08:42.014 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE

02:08:40.613 --> 02:08:43.583 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON PREVENTION AND

02:08:42.014 --> 02:08:45.017 region:rollup2
PERIODONTAL CARROTS ARE GOING

02:08:43.583 --> 02:08:46.919 region:rollup2
TREATMENT CARE I'M AS RENEE

02:08:45.017 --> 02:08:48.421 region:rollup2
MENTIONED EARLIER. I'M WE HAVE

02:08:46.919 --> 02:08:49.355 region:rollup2
GIVEN THAT PROPOSAL TO THE

02:08:48.421 --> 02:08:50.957 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT BUT WOULD URGE THAT

02:08:49.355 --> 02:08:52.191 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE.

02:08:50.957 --> 02:08:54.427 region:rollup2
TO PUSH THE.

02:08:52.191 --> 02:08:55.661 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT REALLY FOCUS ON

02:08:54.427 --> 02:08:56.762 region:rollup2
THOSE TWO TWO PLACES

02:08:55.661 --> 02:08:57.897 region:rollup2
I'M THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

02:08:56.762 --> 02:08:59.198 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL LONG TERM SAVINGS

02:08:57.897 --> 02:09:01.067 region:rollup2
COSTS FOR THE STATE BOTH ON THE

02:08:59.198 --> 02:09:01.601 region:rollup2
PREVENTION AND THE PERIODONTAL

02:09:01.067 --> 02:09:04.203 region:rollup2
CARE SIDE.

02:09:01.601 --> 02:09:05.605 region:rollup2
BUT YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY DOUBLE

02:09:04.203 --> 02:09:06.973 region:rollup2
DISEASES VERY MUCH PREVENT

02:09:05.605 --> 02:09:09.075 region:rollup2
PREVENTABLE AND WE DO HAVE THE

02:09:06.973 --> 02:09:10.042 region:rollup2
DTI FOCUSING ON CHILDREN ZERO TO

02:09:09.075 --> 02:09:11.510 region:rollup2
TWENTY.

02:09:10.042 --> 02:09:13.079 region:rollup2
THERE THERE IS NOTHING FOR

02:09:11.510 --> 02:09:14.347 region:rollup2
ADULTS AND WE KNOW THAT THE DTI

02:09:13.079 --> 02:09:15.715 region:rollup2
IS GOING AWAY AND SO WE WOULD

02:09:14.347 --> 02:09:17.116 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE THE DEPARTMENT TO SORT

02:09:15.715 --> 02:09:18.884 region:rollup2
OF LONG TERM LUCK.

02:09:17.116 --> 02:09:20.553 region:rollup2
HOW WE'RE GOING TO MAINTAIN

02:09:18.884 --> 02:09:22.154 region:rollup2
SOME KIND OF INCENTIVE?

02:09:20.553 --> 02:09:22.922 region:rollup2
FOR PREVENTION FOR CHILDREN A

02:09:22.154 --> 02:09:24.991 region:rollup2
MINUTE ESPECIALLY FOR THE

02:09:22.922 --> 02:09:26.692 region:rollup2
PERIODONTAL CARE I WAS THE ONE

02:09:24.991 --> 02:09:28.294 region:rollup2
AREA I'M OF THE ADULT DENTAL

02:09:26.692 --> 02:09:29.295 region:rollup2
BENEFITS THAT WERE RESTORED.

02:09:28.294 --> 02:09:30.997 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR WHICH WERE VERY

02:09:29.295 --> 02:09:32.565 region:rollup2
PLEASED TO SEE THAT DID NOT

02:09:30.997 --> 02:09:33.966 region:rollup2
RECEIVE A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT

02:09:32.565 --> 02:09:36.068 region:rollup2
IN THERE'S A LOT OF BACKLOG I'M

02:09:33.966 --> 02:09:37.403 region:rollup2
AND IN NEED. OF FOR ADULTS AND

02:09:36.068 --> 02:09:38.838 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S REALLY AN AREA WHERE

02:09:37.403 --> 02:09:40.239 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT IN NEED I AM AND

02:09:38.838 --> 02:09:41.941 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR FOLKS

02:09:40.239 --> 02:09:44.477 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE CHRONIC DISEASE. AND

02:09:41.941 --> 02:09:45.678 region:rollup2
AND THEN I WOULD ALSO AND JUST

02:09:44.477 --> 02:09:47.947 region:rollup2
MAKE A COMMENT AROUND STABILITY

02:09:45.678 --> 02:09:49.448 region:rollup2
AND CONTINUITY INTO CAL IS A

02:09:47.947 --> 02:09:50.816 region:rollup2
PROBLEM AS PROGRAM THE TIDE I'M

02:09:49.448 --> 02:09:51.417 region:rollup2
A LOT OF CHALLENGES AND IT'S

02:09:50.816 --> 02:09:54.053 region:rollup2
BEEN UNDER FUNDED YOU HEARD A

02:09:51.417 --> 02:09:55.554 region:rollup2
LITTLE. BIT OF THE HISTORY THERE

02:09:54.053 --> 02:09:57.156 region:rollup2
I'M THE DTI AND THE PROPOSITION

02:09:55.554 --> 02:09:58.424 region:rollup2
FIFTY SIX WE ARE VERY PLEASED TO

02:09:57.156 --> 02:09:59.992 region:rollup2
SEE THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY

02:09:58.424 --> 02:10:01.527 region:rollup2
HARD ON OUT REACHED OUR MEMBERS

02:09:59.992 --> 02:10:02.828 region:rollup2
TO GET THEM INVOLVED. BUT I

02:10:01.527 --> 02:10:04.363 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S GONNA TAKE AWHILE TO

02:10:02.828 --> 02:10:06.232 region:rollup2
UNDO THE DAMAGE THAT'S BEEN DONE

02:10:04.363 --> 02:10:06.932 region:rollup2
TO THE PROGRAM FRANKLY AND I

02:10:06.232 --> 02:10:09.201 region:rollup2
THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED SOME TIME

02:10:06.932 --> 02:10:11.937 region:rollup2
AND THE ABILITY TO EVALUATE THAT

02:10:09.201 --> 02:10:13.606 region:rollup2
AND. I KNOW WE TALKED LAST MONTH

02:10:11.937 --> 02:10:14.073 region:rollup2
THE BEGINNING IN MARCH FIFTH

02:10:13.606 --> 02:10:15.307 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

02:10:14.073 --> 02:10:16.976 region:rollup2
THE CONTINUITY OF THOSE

02:10:15.307 --> 02:10:18.110 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS OUT WE DO HAVE SOME

02:10:16.976 --> 02:10:19.612 region:rollup2
CONCERNS THAT WHICH IS YOU KNOW

02:10:18.110 --> 02:10:20.446 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

02:10:19.612 --> 02:10:22.048 region:rollup2
NOT SEEING A START STOP.

02:10:20.446 --> 02:10:23.349 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE THOSE PAYMENTS THAT

02:10:22.048 --> 02:10:24.617 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO PROVIDERS BECAUSE

02:10:23.349 --> 02:10:28.854 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY GONNA DISINCENTIVE

02:10:24.617 --> 02:10:29.422 region:rollup2
EYES THEM TO MAKE ANY CHANGES TO

02:10:28.854 --> 02:10:29.889 region:rollup2
THE PRACTICE WHICH IS REALLY

02:10:29.422 --> 02:10:30.890 region:rollup2
WHAT WE WANT TO SEE.

02:10:29.889 --> 02:10:31.490 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU.

02:10:30.890 --> 02:10:33.292 region:rollup2

BECAUSE FOR PAID FOR PATIENTS

STORY.

02:11:11.297 --> 02:11:15.167 region:rollup2
FROM FRESNO WE LEARNED THAT.

02:11:12.865 --> 02:11:16.769 region:rollup2
THERE WAS IN FACT AN UPTICK IN

02:11:15.167 --> 02:11:18.170 region:rollup2
UTILIZATION AND ACCESS FROM

ENROLLEES AND WE ASK WHY HOW IT

02:11:18.170 --> 02:11:20.506 region:rollup2
WAS HAPPENING WE LEARNED THAT

02:11:19.672 --> 02:11:21.207 region:rollup2

OWN CHILDREN I HAVE THREE

02:17:51.864 --> 02:17:54.533 region:rollup2
CHILDREN AND I FEEL STRONGLY.

02:17:53.232 --> 02:17:56.435 region:rollup2
THAT THE KIND OF ACCESS THAT I

02:17:54.533 --> 02:17:58.070 region:rollup2
HAVE JUST KID WE HAPPEN TO HAVE

02:17:56.435 --> 02:17:59.505 region:rollup2
PRIVATE INSURANCE. THEY'VE HELD

02:17:58.070 --> 02:18:01.807 region:rollup2
MY HAND WHEN I DIDN'T KNOW THAT

02:17:59.505 --> 02:18:02.508 region:rollup2
MILK IN A SIPPY CUP WAS NOT BAD.

02:18:01.807 --> 02:18:04.510 region:rollup2
BUT BAD.

02:18:02.508 --> 02:18:05.978 region:rollup2
WHEN IT'S CONSTANT AT THE SAME

02:18:04.510 --> 02:18:07.312 region:rollup2
THING WITH I'M A LOT OF THE A

02:18:05.978 --> 02:18:09.381 region:rollup2
LOT OF THE FAMILIES THEY GET

02:18:07.312 --> 02:18:10.048 region:rollup2
APPLE JUICE AND THEY THINK APPLE

02:18:09.381 --> 02:18:11.617 region:rollup2
JUICE IS GOOD IT'S IN THE WEEK

02:18:10.048 --> 02:18:13.051 region:rollup2

02:18:11.617 --> 02:18:14.586 region:rollup2
SIPPY CUP AND THEY DON'T KNOW

02:18:13.051 --> 02:18:15.521 region:rollup2
THAT THAT REALLY HARMS THEM SO I

02:18:14.586 --> 02:18:16.989 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S EASY TO SAY THEY'RE

02:18:15.521 --> 02:18:19.191 region:rollup2
DOING IT WRONG BUT WE ARE NOT AS

02:18:16.989 --> 02:18:20.759 region:rollup2

YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OF THAT THEM.

02:18:29.868 --> 02:18:31.236 region:rollup2
THE TESTIMONY TODAY I THINK IT'S

02:18:30.536 --> 02:18:32.971 region:rollup2
JUST TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO TAKE

02:18:31.236 --> 02:18:34.940 region:rollup2
A STAND. THERE'S NOT TWO

02:18:32.971 --> 02:18:36.208 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT STANDARDS DEPENDING ON

02:18:34.940 --> 02:18:37.776 region:rollup2
WHAT INSURANCE YOUR OWN AND THAT

02:18:36.208 --> 02:18:39.378 region:rollup2

THE END OF THE LINE. THERE AT

02:30:37.128 --> 02:30:39.697 region:rollup2
THE DOWNSIDE IS THAT IT DOES

02:31:58.276 --> 02:32:00.712 region:rollup2

ADMITTED TO THE OPERATING ROOM I

02:32:00.712 --> 02:32:03.047 region:rollup2

YEARS OF NEGLECT.

BEEN ADRESSED FOR A LONG TIME.

02:32:11.823 --> 02:32:15.593 region:rollup2
I SAW PEOPLE IN THE HOSPITAL WHO

DIED. OF DEADLINE FACTIONS

02:32:15.593 --> 02:32:18.229 region:rollup2

WE WORKED ON.

02:32:44.022 --> 02:32:47.625 region:rollup2
SOMETHING CALLED A VIRTUAL DEL

02:32:45.957 --> 02:32:48.726 region:rollup2
HOME SYSTEM WHICH USES

INTO DENTISTS.

02:32:55.433 --> 02:32:58.336 region:rollup2

LOOK AT AMOUNTS I CAN'T WORK ON

02:33:09.681 --> 02:33:12.216 region:rollup2
THIS PERSON NEEDS TO BE UNDER

02:33:10.682 --> 02:33:13.851 region:rollup2
GENERAL ANESTHESIA. AND YET IN

02:33:12.216 --> 02:33:15.420 region:rollup2
HIS OWN HOME WITH A DENTAL

NEVER HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE

HOSPITAL AGAIN. AND YET HIS

02:33:23.394 --> 02:33:26.564 region:rollup2
HISTORY HAS BEEN SPENDING HUGE

02:33:25.063 --> 02:33:28.399 region:rollup2
AMOUNTS OF MONEY IN A HOSTILE

02:33:26.564 --> 02:33:28.966 region:rollup2
SITUATION FOR SOMETHING THAT WE

02:33:28.399 --> 02:33:29.167 region:rollup2
CAN DO AT A FRACTION OF THE

02:33:28.966 --> 02:33:30.868 region:rollup2
COST.

02:33:29.167 --> 02:33:32.136 region:rollup2
NOW.

02:33:30.868 --> 02:33:34.338 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM IS WE HAVE IDENTICAL

02:33:32.136 --> 02:33:35.740 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THAT ISN'T ORGANIZED TO

02:33:34.338 --> 02:33:36.974 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THAT KIND OF ACTIVITY

02:33:35.740 --> 02:33:38.476 region:rollup2
ADELA CALLOUS PRIMARILY A

02:33:36.974 --> 02:33:40.044 region:rollup2
PIECEWORK SYSTEM IT PAYS FOR THE

02:33:38.476 --> 02:33:42.013 region:rollup2
FILLING. AND IS WILLING NO

02:33:40.044 --> 02:33:43.347 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIATION IN TERMS OF THE

02:33:42.013 --> 02:33:45.049 region:rollup2
OF THE PERSON WHO NEEDS THAT

02:33:43.347 --> 02:33:46.250 region:rollup2
FEELING. THAT PEOPLE WHO WHO

02:33:45.049 --> 02:33:48.052 region:rollup2
COULD ACTUALLY RECEIVE DEL CARE

02:33:46.250 --> 02:33:49.087 region:rollup2
WITH A LECTURE TIME SITTING IN

02:33:48.052 --> 02:33:50.154 region:rollup2
THE CHAIR DOING THINGS MORE

02:33:49.087 --> 02:33:51.456 region:rollup2
SLOWLY THERE'S NO EXTRA

02:33:50.154 --> 02:33:53.257 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT FOR THAT. SOMEONE

02:33:51.456 --> 02:33:54.692 region:rollup2
WHO TAKES A FOUR FIVE CALLS TO

02:33:53.257 --> 02:33:56.594 region:rollup2
THEIR PHYSICIANS TO WORK OUT THE

02:33:54.692 --> 02:33:58.296 region:rollup2
MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS OR WE HAVE

02:33:56.594 --> 02:33:58.896 region:rollup2
TO DEAL WITH CONSENT ISSUES THAT

02:33:58.296 --> 02:34:00.264 region:rollup2
ARE PRESENT IN NORMAL PEOPLE

02:33:58.896 --> 02:34:01.299 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO. BUT EXTRA

02:34:00.264 --> 02:34:04.535 region:rollup2
COMPENSATION FOR ANY OF THOSE

02:34:01.299 --> 02:34:05.803 region:rollup2
KIND OF ACTIVITIES SORES RESULT.

02:34:04.535 --> 02:34:07.105 region:rollup2
AS YOU ALL KNOW IN THE SYSTEM

02:34:05.803 --> 02:34:08.806 region:rollup2
WHERE MANY PROVIDERS WHERE HER

02:34:07.105 --> 02:34:10.875 region:rollup2
ACCEPTING GONNA CALCULATOR DOES

02:34:08.806 --> 02:34:12.276 region:rollup2
BARELY GETTING BY. TO TAKEN AT A

02:34:10.875 --> 02:34:13.344 region:rollup2
PERSON WHO'S GONNA TAKE TWICE OR

02:34:12.276 --> 02:34:14.879 region:rollup2
THREE TIMES A FOUR TIMES AS MANY

02:34:13.344 --> 02:34:16.147 region:rollup2
HOURS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE

02:34:14.879 --> 02:34:17.615 region:rollup2
TREATMENT FOR THEM. IT BECOMES

02:34:16.147 --> 02:34:19.417 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY UNDOABLE

02:34:17.615 --> 02:34:20.818 region:rollup2
SO THIS PROPOSALBEFORE IS TO BE

02:34:19.417 --> 02:34:22.086 region:rollup2
ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THE

02:34:20.818 --> 02:34:23.488 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS IN THESE CONDITIONS

02:34:22.086 --> 02:34:25.156 region:rollup2
THAT DO TAKE EXTRA TIME TO

02:34:23.488 --> 02:34:27.091 region:rollup2
PROVIDE REIMBURSEMENT.

02:34:25.156 --> 02:34:28.392 region:rollup2
FOR THEM I THINK THAT TOUGH THIS

02:34:27.091 --> 02:34:29.494 region:rollup2
IS SOMETHING THAT SOME YOU KNOW

02:34:28.392 --> 02:34:30.928 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD TO QUANTIFY ALL THE

02:34:29.494 --> 02:34:32.663 region:rollup2
SAVINGS IN THIS BECAUSE SOME OF

02:34:30.928 --> 02:34:33.698 region:rollup2
THEM ARE AND. ARE IN OTHER KINDS

02:34:32.663 --> 02:34:35.032 region:rollup2
OF BUCKETS AS YOU ALL KNOW THE

02:34:33.698 --> 02:34:37.001 region:rollup2
WAY WE WE DO OUR ACCOUNTING IN

02:34:35.032 --> 02:34:38.336 region:rollup2
THE WORLD. UP BUT YET I THINK

02:34:37.001 --> 02:34:39.937 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR

02:34:38.336 --> 02:34:41.439 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY.

02:34:39.937 --> 02:34:43.207 region:rollup2
SAVING A LOT OF MONEY BY

02:34:41.439 --> 02:34:43.774 region:rollup2
PROVIDING EARLY AND EFFECTIVE

02:34:43.207 --> 02:34:45.843 region:rollup2
TREATMENT FOR PEOPLE IF YOU

02:34:43.774 --> 02:34:46.677 region:rollup2
COULD PROVIDE. THE UP PROVIDERS

02:34:45.843 --> 02:34:47.512 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA

02:34:46.677 --> 02:34:48.913 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT TO TAKE THE EXTRA

02:34:47.512 --> 02:34:50.348 region:rollup2
TIME TO BE ABLE TO SEE THESE

02:34:48.913 --> 02:34:51.849 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS. I THINK THIS

02:34:50.348 --> 02:34:53.551 region:rollup2
PROPOSES A VERY WISE USE OF

02:34:51.849 --> 02:34:54.252 region:rollup2
PUBLIC MONEY FOR THE STATE OF

02:34:53.551 --> 02:34:56.254 region:rollup2

02:39:48.446 --> 02:39:53.684 region:rollup2
HEALTH PLAN WOULD.

02:39:50.414 --> 02:39:56.787 region:rollup2
TAKE OVER OR ADD DENTAL.

02:39:53.684 --> 02:39:59.256 region:rollup2
SERVICES AS PART OF THEIR CARE

02:39:56.787 --> 02:40:00.291 region:rollup2
SO JUST LIKE PHARMACY OR MEDICAL

02:39:59.256 --> 02:40:02.426 region:rollup2
OR IMAGE SEEN.

02:40:00.291 --> 02:40:03.861 region:rollup2
DENTAL CARE WOULD BE PART OF IT

02:40:02.426 --> 02:40:05.396 region:rollup2
AND THEN THEY WOULD AS THE

02:40:03.861 --> 02:40:06.931 region:rollup2
HEALTHPLAN WHEN THEY'RE. A

02:40:05.396 --> 02:40:09.100 region:rollup2
REMINDING THEIR ENROLLEES IT'S

02:40:06.931 --> 02:40:10.601 region:rollup2

CHOLESTEROL TESTS THEY WOULD NOW

02:40:12.136 --> 02:40:15.239 region:rollup2
BE IN A POSITION TO REMIND

02:40:13.671 --> 02:40:15.940 region:rollup2
PEOPLE IT'S TIME TO.

02:40:15.239 --> 02:40:19.110 region:rollup2
GET.

02:40:15.940 --> 02:40:21.645 region:rollup2
DENTAL EXAM OR A CLEANING.

02:40:19.110 --> 02:40:23.481 region:rollup2
THE WAY WE ENVISION NET AND WE.

02:40:21.645 --> 02:40:25.149 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE TO WORK WITH THE

02:40:23.481 --> 02:40:26.383 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT FOR THEIR GUARD

02:40:25.149 --> 02:40:28.319 region:rollup2
GUIDANCE BUT WITH THE WAY WE

02:40:26.383 --> 02:40:30.187 region:rollup2
ENVISIONED IT WOULD BE THAT THEY

02:40:28.319 --> 02:40:32.389 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR A PER

02:40:30.187 --> 02:40:34.358 region:rollup2
PATIENT PER MONTH. CAPITATED

02:40:32.389 --> 02:40:37.428 region:rollup2
RATE THAT THEY WOULD BE AT RISK

02:40:34.358 --> 02:40:37.862 region:rollup2
FOR SUFFOLK COST MORE THAN WHAT

02:40:37.428 --> 02:40:39.463 region:rollup2
THEY ARE RECEIVING.

02:40:37.862 --> 02:40:40.965 region:rollup2
THE HEALTH PLAN WOULD BE

02:40:39.463 --> 02:40:43.601 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BALANCE.

02:40:40.965 --> 02:40:47.071 region:rollup2
BUT THROWING THAT INTO A.

02:40:43.601 --> 02:40:49.139 region:rollup2
COORDINATED DELIVERY MODEL WE

02:40:47.071 --> 02:40:51.575 region:rollup2
ARE HOPEFUL THAT IT WILL PROVIDE

02:40:49.139 --> 02:40:53.244 region:rollup2
GREATER UTILIZATION BETTER

02:40:51.575 --> 02:40:55.012 region:rollup2
HEALTH OUTCOMES AND THAT. THE

02:40:53.244 --> 02:40:56.580 region:rollup2
HEALTH PLAN COULD ADD EVENTUALLY

02:40:55.012 --> 02:40:57.648 region:rollup2
SAVE MONEY BECAUSE RIGHT NOW

02:40:56.580 --> 02:40:59.950 region:rollup2
THEY'RE SEEING A LOT OF THESE

02:40:57.648 --> 02:41:02.553 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO GET A MORE

02:40:59.950 --> 02:41:05.089 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED HEALTH.

02:41:02.553 --> 02:41:07.091 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW. THINGS THAT THEY NEED

02:41:05.089 --> 02:41:08.759 region:rollup2
TO TREAT AND ARE MORE COSTLY AND

02:41:07.091 --> 02:41:10.194 region:rollup2
SO THEY'RE HOPEFUL THAT THROUGH

02:41:08.759 --> 02:41:12.263 region:rollup2
THIS PLAN THEY'LL BE ABLE TO

02:41:10.194 --> 02:41:14.565 region:rollup2
PREVENT SOME OF THOSE. THE PLAN

02:41:12.263 --> 02:41:16.534 region:rollup2
THEY DO ENVISION A REPORTING

02:41:14.565 --> 02:41:17.635 region:rollup2
MECHANISM WHERE THEY CAN STUDY

02:41:16.534 --> 02:41:20.437 region:rollup2
TO SEE IF THERE IS BETTER

02:41:17.635 --> 02:41:22.640 region:rollup2
UTILIZATION AND BETTER OUTCOMES

02:41:20.437 --> 02:41:24.475 region:rollup2

BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE RISK

SO THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE A.

02:44:37.868 --> 02:44:40.471 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE RECEIVING THE CARE

02:44:38.869 --> 02:44:42.005 region:rollup2
WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THIS

02:44:40.471 --> 02:44:43.607 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO TO YOUR POINT THAT

02:44:42.005 --> 02:44:44.675 region:rollup2

ASSUMING SOME OF THE FINANCIAL

02:44:59.857 --> 02:45:02.993 region:rollup2
RISK THAT OF THEM THEY THEY

02:45:01.225 --> 02:45:04.495 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IN THESE THINGS IN

02:45:02.993 --> 02:45:06.029 region:rollup2

WITH THEIR PROPOSALS MAKE SENSE.

02:45:24.081 --> 02:45:27.351 region:rollup2

AND THEY GO THREE TIMES A WEEK

02:48:13.350 --> 02:48:18.055 region:rollup2
FIFTY TWO WEEKS OUT OF THE YEAR.

02:48:15.752 --> 02:48:20.490 region:rollup2
AND ACCESS TO CARE ISSUE IS

02:48:18.055 --> 02:48:23.160 region:rollup2
GROWING OF FOR THE MEDICAL FEE

02:48:20.490 --> 02:48:23.527 region:rollup2
FOR SERVICE PATIENTS. AND WHAT

02:48:23.160 --> 02:48:25.028 region:rollup2
WE'RE SEEING IS.

02:48:23.527 --> 02:48:27.965 region:rollup2
.

02:48:25.028 --> 02:48:29.366 region:rollup2
ITS DUAL LED DO SOLELY TO THE

02:48:27.965 --> 02:48:31.335 region:rollup2
LOW REIMBURSEMENT RATE AND WE'RE

02:48:29.366 --> 02:48:33.270 region:rollup2
FINDING IT ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF

02:48:31.335 --> 02:48:35.572 region:rollup2
THE METROPOLITAN AREAS IN YOUR

02:48:33.270 --> 02:48:37.174 region:rollup2
MAJOR METROPOLITAN HUBS IT'S

02:48:35.572 --> 02:48:38.775 region:rollup2
THERE'S PLENTY OF PROVIDERS

02:48:37.174 --> 02:48:39.876 region:rollup2
THERE'S PLENTY OF ACCESS. BUT

02:48:38.775 --> 02:48:41.578 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU START GETTING OUT A

02:48:39.876 --> 02:48:43.547 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT AND THEN OF COURSE

02:48:41.578 --> 02:48:45.482 region:rollup2
YOU RURAL AREAS. IF A PROVIDER

02:48:43.547 --> 02:48:47.117 region:rollup2
HAS TO DRIVE MORE THAN TEN MILES

02:48:45.482 --> 02:48:49.853 region:rollup2
TO GO PICK UP A PATIENT.

02:48:47.117 --> 02:48:50.454 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IN OUR INDUSTRY YOU GET

02:48:49.853 --> 02:48:51.521 region:rollup2
PAID WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEBODY ON

02:48:50.454 --> 02:48:53.256 region:rollup2
PORT.

02:48:51.521 --> 02:48:54.658 region:rollup2
THEY ARE SPENDING MONEY OUT OF

02:48:53.256 --> 02:48:56.360 region:rollup2
THEIR POCKET TO PROVIDE THAT

02:48:54.658 --> 02:48:57.494 region:rollup2
SERVICE AND I BELIEVE THAT MR

02:48:56.360 --> 02:48:58.595 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE MENTIONED EARLIER

02:48:57.494 --> 02:49:00.797 region:rollup2
THERE'S ONLY SO MANY.

02:48:58.595 --> 02:49:02.966 region:rollup2
DAYS AND WEEKS YOU CAN RUN AT A

02:49:00.797 --> 02:49:04.935 region:rollup2
LOSS AND SO LOT OF PROVIDERS ARE

02:49:02.966 --> 02:49:07.170 region:rollup2
DISCONTINUING SERVICE TO ANYBODY

02:49:04.935 --> 02:49:09.039 region:rollup2
IN THOSE OUTLYING AREAS. AND.

02:49:07.170 --> 02:49:11.108 region:rollup2
IT'S GETTING WORSE WITH THE

02:49:09.039 --> 02:49:12.642 region:rollup2
PUSH TO MANAGE CARE.

02:49:11.108 --> 02:49:14.411 region:rollup2
MANY OF THE PROVIDERS IN THE

02:49:12.642 --> 02:49:16.613 region:rollup2
PAST WHEN IT WAS PRIMARILY FEE

02:49:14.411 --> 02:49:18.548 region:rollup2
FOR SERVICE HAD TO FIND WAYS TO

02:49:16.613 --> 02:49:19.916 region:rollup2
MAKE IT WORK WELL NOW THEY HAVE

02:49:18.548 --> 02:49:22.152 region:rollup2
ON ANOTHER WHOLE PACE OF

02:49:19.916 --> 02:49:23.887 region:rollup2
PATIENTS THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO.

02:49:22.152 --> 02:49:26.223 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SERVICE AND

02:49:23.887 --> 02:49:27.391 region:rollup2
MAINTAIN THEIR BUSINESS AND NOT

02:49:26.223 --> 02:49:29.059 region:rollup2
HAVE TO RELY SO MUCH ON THE FEE

02:49:27.391 --> 02:49:30.594 region:rollup2
FOR SERVICE SIDE.

02:49:29.059 --> 02:49:32.629 region:rollup2
AND SO WE'RE SEEING THAT LESS

02:49:30.594 --> 02:49:33.864 region:rollup2
AND LESS PROVIDERS ARE ARE

02:49:32.629 --> 02:49:36.166 region:rollup2
ACCEPTING THESE PATIENTS IN

02:49:33.864 --> 02:49:38.402 region:rollup2
THESE OUTLYING AREAS. AND IN

02:49:36.166 --> 02:49:40.771 region:rollup2
YOUR MANAGED CARE COUNTIES.

02:49:38.402 --> 02:49:42.439 region:rollup2
MOST OF THE MANAGED CARE PLANS

02:49:40.771 --> 02:49:44.841 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY THE ONES A COVER

02:49:42.439 --> 02:49:46.376 region:rollup2
RURAL AREAS ARE PAYING ABOVE

02:49:44.841 --> 02:49:48.512 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL FEE FOR SERVICE RATE

02:49:46.376 --> 02:49:50.247 region:rollup2
AND ABOVE BEFORE OR WHAT THE TEN

02:49:48.512 --> 02:49:52.849 region:rollup2
PERCENT CUT IT'S AND SO I WORK

02:49:50.247 --> 02:49:53.784 region:rollup2
WITH. COUNTY SUB PARTNERSHIP NOT

02:49:52.849 --> 02:49:54.418 region:rollup2
HEALTH PLAN THAT COVERS.

02:49:53.784 --> 02:50:00.424 region:rollup2
I WON'T DO A BUNCH OF WORK FANS

02:49:54.418 --> 02:50:01.458 region:rollup2
HAVE A LOT OF RURAL AREAS

02:50:00.424 --> 02:50:02.793 region:rollup2
THAT THEY COVER AND THEY PAY

02:50:01.458 --> 02:50:04.094 region:rollup2
WELL ABOVE THE.

02:50:02.793 --> 02:50:06.863 region:rollup2
HUNDRED PERCENT.

02:50:04.094 --> 02:50:08.031 region:rollup2
MEDICAID OUTBREAK THERE ADDING

02:50:06.863 --> 02:50:09.966 region:rollup2
ANOTHER FIFTEEN TO.

02:50:08.031 --> 02:50:11.101 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE PERCENT ON TOP OF

02:50:09.966 --> 02:50:12.269 region:rollup2
THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR

02:50:11.101 --> 02:50:14.237 region:rollup2
MEMBERS ARE RECEIVING THE

02:50:12.269 --> 02:50:14.404 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION NOTHING NEED.

02:50:14.237 --> 02:50:16.440 region:rollup2
SO.

02:50:14.404 --> 02:50:18.241 region:rollup2
.

02:50:16.440 --> 02:50:18.842 region:rollup2

A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO GO TO MANAGE

02:50:33.090 --> 02:50:36.093 region:rollup2
CARE THEN DROPOFF THERE'S A

02:50:34.224 --> 02:50:37.194 region:rollup2
CONSTANT TURNING. FOR ONE REASON

02:50:36.093 --> 02:50:39.062 region:rollup2

THE SERVICE SAID ED THEY DON'T

02:50:44.134 --> 02:50:46.136 region:rollup2

TRANSPORTATION THAT THEY NEED

02:50:47.637 --> 02:50:50.373 region:rollup2
AND THAT IT'S MONTHS BEFORE THEY

GET BACK ON THE MANAGED CARE

02:50:50.373 --> 02:50:53.744 region:rollup2

AFFECT EVERYTHING OF THAT GOES

02:50:57.380 --> 02:51:00.817 region:rollup2
ON IN MEDI CAL SO THAT'S WHY

02:50:59.416 --> 02:51:03.420 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT. THE NOT IMMATURE

02:51:00.817 --> 02:51:04.087 region:rollup2
MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION WAS THE

02:51:03.420 --> 02:51:04.721 region:rollup2

FROM A REVISION HOWEVER WE DO

03:09:53.282 --> 03:09:57.486 region:rollup2
KNOW SOME SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES

03:09:55.551 --> 03:09:59.855 region:rollup2
TO DEVELOPING A FISCAL ETHNIC ON

03:09:57.486 --> 03:10:00.456 region:rollup2
THE IMPACT TO COVERED ENTITIES.

03:09:59.855 --> 03:10:00.656 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE LACK OF

03:10:00.456 --> 03:10:01.924 region:rollup2
DATA.

03:10:00.656 --> 03:10:04.593 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MA'AM.

THANK YOU SIR.

AMBER.

03:10:07.196 --> 03:10:09.632 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU MANY OF THEM ARE

03:10:09.031 --> 03:10:11.233 region:rollup2
OUGHT AND WITH THE CALIFORNIA

HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WE

03:10:11.233 --> 03:10:14.536 region:rollup2
REPRESENT OVER FOUR HUNDRED

03:10:12.968 --> 03:10:16.105 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS ACROSS THE STATE.

03:10:14.536 --> 03:10:17.673 region:rollup2
INCLUDING ONE HUNDRED HUNDRED

03:10:16.105 --> 03:10:19.008 region:rollup2
AND SEVENTY FIVE HOSPITALS THAT

03:10:17.673 --> 03:10:20.643 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IN THE THREE FORTY

03:10:19.008 --> 03:10:22.878 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM.

03:10:20.643 --> 03:10:23.946 region:rollup2
WHAT BIPARTISAN SUPPORT CONGRESS

PROGRAM BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY

03:10:25.414 --> 03:10:28.817 region:rollup2
TWO?

03:10:27.049 --> 03:10:30.552 region:rollup2
AND THE STATED COMPRESSIONAL

QUOTE IS TO STRETCH SCARCE%

03:10:32.488 --> 03:10:36.191 region:rollup2
FEDERAL RESOURCES AS FAR AS

03:10:34.523 --> 03:10:37.726 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE REACHING MORE ELIGIBLE

03:10:36.191 --> 03:10:40.229 region:rollup2
PATIENTS AND PROVIDING MORE

03:10:37.726 --> 03:10:41.397 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES.

03:10:40.229 --> 03:10:42.998 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR THE

03:10:41.397 --> 03:10:44.967 region:rollup2
THREE FORTY BE PROGRAM HOSPITAL

03:10:42.998 --> 03:10:46.468 region:rollup2
MUST BE EITHER A NOT FOR PROFIT

03:10:44.967 --> 03:10:49.004 region:rollup2
ENTITY OR A PUBLICLY OWNED

03:10:46.468 --> 03:10:49.905 region:rollup2
ENTITY. AND MUST SERVE A

03:10:49.004 --> 03:10:52.808 region:rollup2
DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF

03:10:49.905 --> 03:10:53.909 region:rollup2
MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PATIENTS.

03:10:52.808 --> 03:10:55.644 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE SERVICES THAT ARE

03:10:53.909 --> 03:10:57.546 region:rollup2
FUNDED WITH SAVINGS FROM THE

03:10:55.644 --> 03:10:59.515 region:rollup2
THREE FORTY BE PROGRAM. INCLUDE

03:10:57.546 --> 03:11:01.817 region:rollup2
OUTPATIENT CHEMOTHERAPY CENTERS

03:10:59.515 --> 03:11:03.886 region:rollup2
MOBILE AND PRIMARY CARE CLINICS

03:11:01.817 --> 03:11:06.155 region:rollup2
DIABETES SCREENING HEPATITIS C.

03:11:03.886 --> 03:11:08.590 region:rollup2
TREATMENT AND HIV CLINICS.

03:11:06.155 --> 03:11:09.925 region:rollup2
THESE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES ARE

03:11:08.590 --> 03:11:12.094 region:rollup2
REACHING DIRECTLY INTO OUR LOCAL

03:11:09.925 --> 03:11:13.162 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

03:11:12.094 --> 03:11:13.696 region:rollup2
AND FOR SOME OF THE SMALL AND

03:11:13.162 --> 03:11:15.631 region:rollup2
RURAL HOSPITALS ACROSS OUR

03:11:13.696 --> 03:11:17.199 region:rollup2
STATE.

03:11:15.631 --> 03:11:18.500 region:rollup2
THE SAVINGS REALLY DO MEAN THE

03:11:17.199 --> 03:11:21.804 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KEEPING THEIR

03:11:18.500 --> 03:11:23.706 region:rollup2
DOORS OPEN AND HAVING THE CLOSE.

03:11:21.804 --> 03:11:24.840 region:rollup2
THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO

03:11:23.706 --> 03:11:26.608 region:rollup2
ELIMINATE THE THREE FORTY BE

03:11:24.840 --> 03:11:28.544 region:rollup2
PROGRAM FOR MEDI CAL BUT NOT

03:11:26.608 --> 03:11:30.145 region:rollup2
ONLY REDUCE ACCESS TO VITAL

03:11:28.544 --> 03:11:31.980 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE SERVICES. IT WOULD

03:11:30.145 --> 03:11:33.048 region:rollup2
ALSO SEVER A LIFELINE THAT

03:11:31.980 --> 03:11:35.617 region:rollup2
PROVIDES FREE DRUGS TO

03:11:33.048 --> 03:11:36.852 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE PATIENTS.

03:11:35.617 --> 03:11:38.721 region:rollup2
IF HOSPITALS ARE NO LONGER ABLE

03:11:36.852 --> 03:11:40.255 region:rollup2
TO PURCHASE DRUGS THROUGH THE

03:11:38.721 --> 03:11:41.390 region:rollup2
THREE FORTY PROGRAM. THEY WILL

03:11:40.255 --> 03:11:43.559 region:rollup2
BE FORCED TO PURCHASE THEM AT

03:11:41.390 --> 03:11:45.294 region:rollup2
THE WHOLESALE ACQUISITION COST.

03:11:43.559 --> 03:11:47.329 region:rollup2
WHICH CAN BE MORE THAN DOUBLE

03:11:45.294 --> 03:11:48.831 region:rollup2
THE THREE FORTY BE PRICE.

03:11:47.329 --> 03:11:50.265 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS PER A FEDERAL

03:11:48.831 --> 03:11:52.267 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT THAT SAYS THREE

03:11:50.265 --> 03:11:54.136 region:rollup2
FORTY BE COVERED ENTITIES CANNOT

03:11:52.267 --> 03:11:55.871 region:rollup2
PURCHASE DRUGS THROUGH GROUP

03:11:54.136 --> 03:11:56.972 region:rollup2
PURCHASING ARRANGEMENTS

03:11:55.871 --> 03:11:58.774 region:rollup2
SO THEY REALLY WOULD BE PAYING

03:11:56.972 --> 03:12:00.809 region:rollup2
THE HIGHEST PRICE ON THESE DRUGS

03:11:58.774 --> 03:12:02.745 region:rollup2
IN THE MARKET.

03:12:00.809 --> 03:12:04.680 region:rollup2
IT'S ESTIMATED THAT THE PROPOSAL

03:12:02.745 --> 03:12:06.548 region:rollup2
WOULD COST HOSPITAL'S HUNDREDS

03:12:04.680 --> 03:12:08.517 region:rollup2
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

03:12:06.548 --> 03:12:09.718 region:rollup2
AND THAT THE STATE WOULD THEN BE

03:12:08.517 --> 03:12:11.387 region:rollup2
ABLE TO CLAIM THE REBATES ON

03:12:09.718 --> 03:12:13.555 region:rollup2
THESE DRUGS THERE'S NO DOUBT

03:12:11.387 --> 03:12:15.324 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WILL OCCUR.

03:12:13.555 --> 03:12:17.226 region:rollup2
BUT UNFORTUNATELY AS THE LA.

03:12:15.324 --> 03:12:18.460 region:rollup2
REPORTED THE STATE ONLY GETS TO

03:12:17.226 --> 03:12:20.329 region:rollup2
KEEP ABOUT A THIRD OF THOSE

03:12:18.460 --> 03:12:22.765 region:rollup2
REBATES.

03:12:20.329 --> 03:12:24.133 region:rollup2
MEANING THAT TWO THIRDS OF THE

03:12:22.765 --> 03:12:26.268 region:rollup2
DOLLARS WOULD BE SENT TO THE

03:12:24.133 --> 03:12:28.037 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

03:12:26.268 --> 03:12:29.505 region:rollup2
AND INSTEAD OF KEEPING THESE

03:12:28.037 --> 03:12:31.306 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

03:12:29.505 --> 03:12:33.742 region:rollup2
IN SAVINGS WITHIN OUR HEALTHCARE

03:12:31.306 --> 03:12:35.677 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

03:12:33.742 --> 03:12:37.846 region:rollup2
WE SEND THEM TO WASHINGTON DC.

03:12:35.677 --> 03:12:41.216 region:rollup2
WHICH IS INCREDIBLY CONCERNING

03:12:37.846 --> 03:12:42.384 region:rollup2
FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE.

03:12:41.216 --> 03:12:44.153 region:rollup2
NATURALLY THAT IF THERE ARE LESS

03:12:42.384 --> 03:12:44.753 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

03:12:44.153 --> 03:12:46.522 region:rollup2
THERE IS GOING TO BE AN IMPACT

03:12:44.753 --> 03:12:48.257 region:rollup2
ON ACT.

03:12:46.522 --> 03:12:50.426 region:rollup2
AND THOSE THREE FORTY THE

03:12:48.257 --> 03:12:51.827 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS THAT TREAT THE LARGEST

03:12:50.426 --> 03:12:53.629 region:rollup2
PORTION OF MEDICAL PATIENTS.

03:12:51.827 --> 03:12:55.397 region:rollup2
WILL BE DISPROPORTIONATELY

03:12:53.629 --> 03:12:57.166 region:rollup2
HARMED BY THIS PROPOSAL AND THEY

03:12:55.397 --> 03:12:59.301 region:rollup2
WILL BE FORCED TO REDUCE OR

03:12:57.166 --> 03:13:00.736 region:rollup2
ELIMINATE SERVICES. AND THERE

03:12:59.301 --> 03:13:01.970 region:rollup2
WILL NOT BE ACCESS TO THESE FREE

03:13:00.736 --> 03:13:04.073 region:rollup2
DRUGS FOR THE VULNERABLE

03:13:01.970 --> 03:13:05.541 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS.

03:13:04.073 --> 03:13:07.409 region:rollup2
BUT THERE OUR SOLUTIONS TO THE

03:13:05.541 --> 03:13:09.978 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL.

03:13:07.409 --> 03:13:11.480 region:rollup2
AND IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE

03:13:09.978 --> 03:13:13.348 region:rollup2
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL

03:13:11.480 --> 03:13:15.117 region:rollup2
RELEASED A REPORT.

03:13:13.348 --> 03:13:16.752 region:rollup2
THAT STUDIED HOW THIRTY SEVEN

03:13:15.117 --> 03:13:18.554 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT STATES HAVE FOUND WAYS

03:13:16.752 --> 03:13:19.988 region:rollup2
TO IDENTIFY THREE FORTY BE

03:13:18.554 --> 03:13:22.357 region:rollup2
CLAIMS IN MEDICAID MANAGED CARE

03:13:19.988 --> 03:13:25.394 region:rollup2
CLINICS.

03:13:22.357 --> 03:13:28.063 region:rollup2
AND ONE EXAMPLE.

03:13:25.394 --> 03:13:29.865 region:rollup2
WAS THAT HOSPITALS HEALTH PLANS

03:13:28.063 --> 03:13:31.633 region:rollup2
CLINICS VENDORS COULD SUBMIT A

03:13:29.865 --> 03:13:33.102 region:rollup2
FILE TO THE STATE THAT GIVES

03:13:31.633 --> 03:13:34.636 region:rollup2
THEM ALL OF THE DATA THEY NEED

03:13:33.102 --> 03:13:36.305 region:rollup2
TO IDENTIFY THE THREE FORTY BE

03:13:34.636 --> 03:13:37.706 region:rollup2
CLAIMS AND EXCLUDE THEM FROM

03:13:36.305 --> 03:13:39.575 region:rollup2
THEIR REBATE REQUEST.

03:13:37.706 --> 03:13:41.276 region:rollup2
AND IN FACT

03:13:39.575 --> 03:13:42.778 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA APPROVED A MODEL THAT

03:13:41.276 --> 03:13:44.012 region:rollup2
DOES JUST THAT IF WITH

03:13:42.778 --> 03:13:45.447 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP HEALTH PLAN BACK IN

03:13:44.012 --> 03:13:46.915 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOURTEEN.

03:13:45.447 --> 03:13:48.984 region:rollup2
AND THAT MODEL HAS BEEN IN PLACE

03:13:46.915 --> 03:13:50.953 region:rollup2
FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS AND IT

03:13:48.984 --> 03:13:52.688 region:rollup2
DOES REQUIRE THAT THE STATE

03:13:50.953 --> 03:13:54.456 region:rollup2
RECEIVE A FILE. WITH THE

03:13:52.688 --> 03:13:56.758 region:rollup2
NECESSARY ELEMENTS SO THAT THEY

03:13:54.456 --> 03:13:57.826 region:rollup2
CAN IDENTIFY AND EXCLUDE THREE

03:13:56.758 --> 03:13:59.528 region:rollup2
FORTY BE DRUGS FROM THEIR REBATE

03:13:57.826 --> 03:14:00.629 region:rollup2
REQUESTS.

03:13:59.528 --> 03:14:02.464 region:rollup2
WHICH REALLY BRINGS INTO

03:14:00.629 --> 03:14:04.132 region:rollup2
QUESTION WHY CAN'T NOT TYPE OF A

03:14:02.464 --> 03:14:05.701 region:rollup2
MODEL BE EXPANDED ACROSS THE

03:14:04.132 --> 03:14:07.002 region:rollup2
STATE. SO WE CAN PRESERVE THE

03:14:05.701 --> 03:14:09.271 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AND ENSURE FEDERAL

03:14:07.002 --> 03:14:10.572 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE.

03:14:09.271 --> 03:14:12.174 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY I'D LIKE TO MENTION

03:14:10.572 --> 03:14:13.809 region:rollup2
THAT LAST MONTH THE STATE DID

03:14:12.174 --> 03:14:15.811 region:rollup2
RELEASE A DRAFT ALL PLANNED

03:14:13.809 --> 03:14:16.979 region:rollup2
LETTER FOR PUBLIC COMMENT.

03:14:15.811 --> 03:14:18.480 region:rollup2
AND ONCE STATED PURPOSE ABOUT

03:14:16.979 --> 03:14:20.282 region:rollup2
APL WAS TO CLARIFY THE PLANS

03:14:18.480 --> 03:14:22.017 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITIES RELATED TO

03:14:20.282 --> 03:14:23.986 region:rollup2
REPORTING DRUGS PURCHASED

03:14:22.017 --> 03:14:25.921 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE THREE FORTY PROGRAM.

03:14:23.986 --> 03:14:27.756 region:rollup2
THE A CAL CLEARLY OUTLINES THE

03:14:25.921 --> 03:14:29.525 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS OF THE PLAN

03:14:27.756 --> 03:14:31.994 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY THREE FORTY BE DRUGS AT

03:14:29.525 --> 03:14:34.062 region:rollup2
THE CLAIM LEVEL USING NATIONALLY

03:14:31.994 --> 03:14:35.764 region:rollup2
STANDARD INDICATORS.

03:14:34.062 --> 03:14:36.999 region:rollup2
AND IT ALSO REQUIRES THE PLANS

03:14:35.764 --> 03:14:38.333 region:rollup2
HAVE FORMAL POLICIES IN PLACE TO

03:14:36.999 --> 03:14:40.302 region:rollup2
PREVENT DUPLICATE DISCOUNTS WITH

03:14:38.333 --> 03:14:41.737 region:rollup2
CONTRACT PHARMACIES.

03:14:40.302 --> 03:14:44.273 region:rollup2
IN OUR OPINION THAT IT FELT

03:14:41.737 --> 03:14:45.307 region:rollup2
PROVIDE SOME VIABLE SOLUTIONS

03:14:44.273 --> 03:14:47.042 region:rollup2
THAT ADDRESS THE DEPARTMENT'S

03:14:45.307 --> 03:14:48.143 region:rollup2
CONCERNS AND WE REALLY DO LOOK

03:14:47.042 --> 03:14:50.412 region:rollup2
FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE

03:14:48.143 --> 03:14:52.347 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT. TO SEE HOW WE CAN

03:14:50.412 --> 03:14:54.483 region:rollup2
MAKE THESE SOLUTIONS A REALITY.

03:14:52.347 --> 03:14:55.918 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS ARE COMMITTED TO BEING

03:14:54.483 --> 03:14:57.819 region:rollup2
GOOD STEWARDS OF THE THREE FORTY

03:14:55.918 --> 03:15:00.322 region:rollup2
BE PROGRAM AND WE SUPPORT

03:14:57.819 --> 03:15:00.822 region:rollup2
REPORTING MODIFICATIONS THAT

03:15:00.322 --> 03:15:02.491 region:rollup2
WOULD STRENGTHEN PROGRAM

03:15:00.822 --> 03:15:04.293 region:rollup2
INTEGRITY AND.

03:15:02.491 --> 03:15:05.827 region:rollup2
BUT THE PROPOSED ONE FRONT ABOUT

03:15:04.293 --> 03:15:07.696 region:rollup2
THAT FAR TOO EXTREME.

03:15:05.827 --> 03:15:08.964 region:rollup2
AND IT WOULD HAVE A DETRIMENTAL

03:15:07.696 --> 03:15:11.700 region:rollup2
EFFECT ON ACCESS FOR ALL

03:15:08.964 --> 03:15:12.968 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS.

03:15:11.700 --> 03:15:14.403 region:rollup2
I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE BY SAYING

03:15:12.968 --> 03:15:16.204 region:rollup2
THAT NO OTHER STATE IN THE

03:15:14.403 --> 03:15:18.640 region:rollup2
COUNTRY HASN'T ACTED SUCH A

03:15:16.204 --> 03:15:19.741 region:rollup2
HARMFUL POLICY. AND I ASK THAT

03:15:18.640 --> 03:15:20.976 region:rollup2
THIS COMMITTEE PLEASE REJECT THE

03:15:19.741 --> 03:15:23.445 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION'S FOR.

03:15:20.976 --> 03:15:26.048 region:rollup2
WE GIVE THEM.

03:15:23.445 --> 03:15:27.983 region:rollup2
COOPER.

03:15:26.048 --> 03:15:29.251 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU

03:15:27.983 --> 03:15:30.852 region:rollup2
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THE

03:15:29.251 --> 03:15:32.287 region:rollup2
HEALTH CENTER PERSPECTIVE ON

03:15:30.852 --> 03:15:33.922 region:rollup2
THREE FORTY BE PROGRAM AND THE

03:15:32.287 --> 03:15:35.624 region:rollup2

ADMINISTRATIVE CHALLENGES AND

03:20:54.276 --> 03:20:57.679 region:rollup2
THE.

03:20:54.743 --> 03:20:59.648 region:rollup2
CUT COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL

UNDER THE PROPOSAL.

03:21:04.152 --> 03:21:07.155 region:rollup2

PARTICULAR PROPOSALS A VERY

03:25:45.233 --> 03:25:47.969 region:rollup2
INEFFICIENT WAY TO DO THAT IT

03:25:46.935 --> 03:25:49.103 region:rollup2
WOULD EFFECTIVELY TAKE TWO

03:25:47.969 --> 03:25:50.772 region:rollup2
THIRDS OF THE BENEFIT OF THE

MORE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS. IT'S

03:25:54.776 --> 03:25:57.879 region:rollup2
NOT AN EFFICIENT WAY TO DO THAT

03:25:56.277 --> 03:25:59.647 region:rollup2
IF IT'S ABOUT A BETTER OVERSIGHT

03:25:57.879 --> 03:26:00.748 region:rollup2
OR TRANSPARENCY IT'S NOT AN

03:25:59.647 --> 03:26:02.050 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT WAY TO DO THAT.

03:26:00.748 --> 03:26:03.518 region:rollup2
ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING JUST I'D

03:26:02.050 --> 03:26:06.054 region:rollup2

03:36:50.631 --> 03:36:53.634 region:rollup2
IF YOU CAN EXPLAIN THAT TO. US

03:36:52.233 --> 03:36:57.004 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY SO.

03:36:53.634 --> 03:36:57.271 region:rollup2
A DRUG CAN EITHER RECEIVE A

03:36:57.004 --> 03:36:59.707 region:rollup2
DISCOUNT.

03:36:57.271 --> 03:37:01.775 region:rollup2
YOU CAN EITHER PLAY DISCOUNT

03:36:59.707 --> 03:37:02.977 region:rollup2
THAT ESSENTIALLY THAT DRUG

03:37:01.775 --> 03:37:04.945 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURERS PAYING FOR.

03:37:02.977 --> 03:37:06.013 region:rollup2
EITHER TO A COVERED ENTITY

03:37:04.945 --> 03:37:08.682 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE THREE FORTY BE

03:37:06.013 --> 03:37:10.317 region:rollup2
PROGRAM OR THROUGH A MEDICAID

03:37:08.682 --> 03:37:12.853 region:rollup2
DRUG REBATE SO THESE ARE TWO

03:37:10.317 --> 03:37:15.289 region:rollup2
SEPARATE PROGRAMS AND.

03:37:12.853 --> 03:37:17.258 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS AND ISSUES

03:37:15.289 --> 03:37:17.791 region:rollup2
IS THAT WE'RE HAVING A CHALLENGE

03:37:17.258 --> 03:37:20.528 region:rollup2
OF.

03:37:17.791 --> 03:37:22.096 region:rollup2
AT SOMETIMES ACCIDENTALLY OR

03:37:20.528 --> 03:37:23.330 region:rollup2
ARE UNINTENTIONALLY.

03:37:22.096 --> 03:37:25.633 region:rollup2
GET IT GET IT TRYING TO GET

03:37:23.330 --> 03:37:26.901 region:rollup2
DISCOUNTS ON BOTH AND SO.

03:37:25.633 --> 03:37:28.869 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN UNDER THE

03:37:26.901 --> 03:37:30.471 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS THAT WE

03:37:28.869 --> 03:37:31.138 region:rollup2
WOULD GET THE MEDICAID DRUG

03:37:30.471 --> 03:37:33.574 region:rollup2
REBATE?

03:37:31.138 --> 03:37:35.709 region:rollup2
AND THAT COVERED ENTITIES WOULD

03:37:33.574 --> 03:37:37.945 region:rollup2
HAVE TO FOREGO THE THREE FORTY

03:37:35.709 --> 03:37:39.713 region:rollup2
BE DISCOUNT.

03:37:37.945 --> 03:37:41.015 region:rollup2
YES BUT THAT HOW DOES THAT GIVE

03:37:39.713 --> 03:37:42.750 region:rollup2
US GIVE THE STATE SAVINGS.

03:37:41.015 --> 03:37:45.185 region:rollup2
.

03:37:42.750 --> 03:37:47.221 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

03:37:45.185 --> 03:37:49.823 region:rollup2
MY UNDERSTAND OUR UNDERSTANDING

03:37:47.221 --> 03:37:51.358 region:rollup2
OF HOW THESE WORK IS BAIT THAT

03:37:49.823 --> 03:37:53.360 region:rollup2
DISCOUNTS ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY

03:37:51.358 --> 03:37:55.062 region:rollup2
COMPARABLE AND HOW THEY'RE

03:37:53.360 --> 03:37:57.064 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTED IT SAGA IT'S A

03:37:55.062 --> 03:37:59.466 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE DISCOUNT OR.

03:37:57.064 --> 03:38:00.734 region:rollup2
THE REQUIREMENT FOR DRUG

03:37:59.466 --> 03:38:01.969 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURERS TO PROVIDE THE

03:38:00.734 --> 03:38:04.138 region:rollup2
BEST PRICE.

03:38:01.969 --> 03:38:06.240 region:rollup2
THAT'S AVAILABLE TO ANY SORT OF

03:38:04.138 --> 03:38:08.042 region:rollup2
MOST PRIVATE PAYERS AND A LOT A

03:38:06.240 --> 03:38:10.277 region:rollup2
LOT OF PUBLIC PAYERS TO. THAT

03:38:08.042 --> 03:38:12.112 region:rollup2
THE ESSENTIALLY THE STATUTE OF

03:38:10.277 --> 03:38:14.081 region:rollup2
THE STATUTORY DISCOUNT IS THE

03:38:12.112 --> 03:38:16.383 region:rollup2
SAME FOR BOTH THE THREE FORTY BE

03:38:14.081 --> 03:38:17.851 region:rollup2
ENTITY AND FOR THE MEDICAID

03:38:16.383 --> 03:38:20.187 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IT'S JUST THAT YOU CAN

03:38:17.851 --> 03:38:21.655 region:rollup2
ONLY HAVE ONE OF THE PRO ONE GET

03:38:20.187 --> 03:38:23.090 region:rollup2
IT AND THE OTHER CANNOT FINISH

03:38:21.655 --> 03:38:24.525 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD. LIKE I COULD JUST.

03:38:23.090 --> 03:38:26.160 region:rollup2
NO I UNDERSTAND THAT PART I

03:38:24.525 --> 03:38:28.295 region:rollup2
THINK WHAT I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING

03:38:26.160 --> 03:38:29.663 region:rollup2
IS HOW WOULD THAT DIRECTLY

03:38:28.295 --> 03:38:32.232 region:rollup2
BENEFIT THE STATE ARE HOW WHAT.

03:38:29.663 --> 03:38:33.901 region:rollup2
WHO WHO WOULD GET THE DISK WHO

03:38:32.232 --> 03:38:35.035 region:rollup2
WOULD GET THE COST SAVINGS WILL

03:38:33.901 --> 03:38:36.070 region:rollup2
HELP WITH THAT IT WOULD BE

03:38:35.035 --> 03:38:37.838 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT WOULD BE

03:38:36.070 --> 03:38:38.973 region:rollup2
MEDICARE MEDICAID LIKE I OWE YOU

03:38:37.838 --> 03:38:40.441 region:rollup2
AN APOLOGY?

03:38:38.973 --> 03:38:43.177 region:rollup2
SO THE THE.

03:38:40.441 --> 03:38:44.144 region:rollup2
FOR ALL MEDICAID REBATES FOR

03:38:43.177 --> 03:38:46.380 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL.

03:38:44.144 --> 03:38:48.549 region:rollup2
WE COLLECT THE DHS COLLECTS

03:38:46.380 --> 03:38:49.817 region:rollup2
THOSE REBATES AND THEY OFFSET

03:38:48.549 --> 03:38:51.352 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND SPENDING IN THE

03:38:49.817 --> 03:38:52.953 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AND SO IT ESSENTIALLY

03:38:51.352 --> 03:38:54.788 region:rollup2
WOULD REDUCE THE GENERAL FUND

03:38:52.953 --> 03:38:56.557 region:rollup2
OBLIGATION TO SORT OF FIND. MEDI

03:38:54.788 --> 03:38:58.025 region:rollup2
CAL ON AN ONGOING BASIS.

03:38:56.557 --> 03:38:59.193 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT WOULD FREE UP

03:38:58.025 --> 03:39:03.897 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL GENERAL FUND

03:38:59.193 --> 03:39:06.033 region:rollup2
RESOURCES FOR. FOR OTHER USES.

03:39:03.897 --> 03:39:07.968 region:rollup2
OKAY BUT BUT IF THE SO SO BUT

03:39:06.033 --> 03:39:09.970 region:rollup2
THREE FORTY BE WHAT YOU'RE

03:39:07.968 --> 03:39:11.639 region:rollup2
SAYING IS THAT THAT.

03:39:09.970 --> 03:39:13.240 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD GET THE DISCOUNT BUT

03:39:11.639 --> 03:39:13.674 region:rollup2
THEN IN THE MEANTIME THE THREE

03:39:13.240 --> 03:39:16.210 region:rollup2
FORTY BPM.

03:39:13.674 --> 03:39:16.477 region:rollup2
IS BEING PAID TO THE CLINICS

03:39:16.210 --> 03:39:18.278 region:rollup2
INTO THE.

03:39:16.477 --> 03:39:18.912 region:rollup2
.

03:39:18.278 --> 03:39:19.813 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS

03:39:18.912 --> 03:39:21.849 region:rollup2
BUT.

03:39:19.813 --> 03:39:22.649 region:rollup2
OKAY.

03:39:21.849 --> 03:39:24.618 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT

03:39:22.649 --> 03:39:26.120 region:rollup2
THESE THE SAVINGS WOULD BE IN

03:39:24.618 --> 03:39:28.122 region:rollup2
PLACE OF SAVINGS THAT ARE

03:39:26.120 --> 03:39:30.124 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY OUT RETAIN TO AT LEAST

03:39:28.122 --> 03:39:31.225 region:rollup2
SOME EXTENT BY THREE FORTY BE

03:39:30.124 --> 03:39:33.660 region:rollup2
ENTITIES AND POTENTIALLY OTHER

03:39:31.225 --> 03:39:35.829 region:rollup2
PARTICIPANTS IN THAT IN IN THE.

03:39:33.660 --> 03:39:36.897 region:rollup2
IN SORT OF STUFF UP THE PAYMENT

03:39:35.829 --> 03:39:39.666 region:rollup2
CHAIN.

03:39:36.897 --> 03:39:41.168 region:rollup2
OKAY BUT IF AN AND I'M AGAIN I'M

03:39:39.666 --> 03:39:43.003 region:rollup2
STILL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THIS

03:39:41.168 --> 03:39:44.471 region:rollup2
BECAUSE. IF

03:39:43.003 --> 03:39:46.473 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THOUGH IS IT

03:39:44.471 --> 03:39:49.243 region:rollup2
FROM PREVIOUS COMMENTS WAS THAT

03:39:46.473 --> 03:39:50.444 region:rollup2
IT WAS BEING DOUBLE. A REBATED

03:39:49.243 --> 03:39:52.346 region:rollup2
SO THE STATE IS TALKING THE

03:39:50.444 --> 03:39:53.013 region:rollup2
REBATE AND THEN SO WAS THAT

03:39:52.346 --> 03:39:55.115 region:rollup2
THREE FORTY BE.

03:39:53.013 --> 03:39:56.550 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS ARE STILL GETTING SO

03:39:55.115 --> 03:39:58.285 region:rollup2
SOFT.

03:39:56.550 --> 03:39:59.686 region:rollup2
I CAN'T WRAP MY HEAD AROUND HOW

03:39:58.285 --> 03:40:01.288 region:rollup2
THE DISCOUNT WOULD HAPPEN IF

03:39:59.686 --> 03:40:02.823 region:rollup2
YOU'RE STILL GETTING BUT THIS

03:40:01.288 --> 03:40:03.957 region:rollup2
COUNTS ANYWAY WHAT YEARS WHAT

03:40:02.823 --> 03:40:05.826 region:rollup2
I'M HEARING IS THAT THERE'S

03:40:03.957 --> 03:40:07.261 region:rollup2
DOUBLE REBATES. AND SO THE STATE

03:40:05.826 --> 03:40:08.962 region:rollup2
IS STILL GETTING THE THE

03:40:07.261 --> 03:40:09.329 region:rollup2
DISCOUNT OR THE.

03:40:08.962 --> 03:40:11.498 region:rollup2
THE.

03:40:09.329 --> 03:40:13.033 region:rollup2
THE SAVINGS THAT YOU ARE

03:40:11.498 --> 03:40:14.802 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT THAT.

03:40:13.033 --> 03:40:17.137 region:rollup2
OKAY SO LET ME JUST UNDERSTAND

03:40:14.802 --> 03:40:18.305 region:rollup2
THE SOUL SO PART OF THE ISSUE

03:40:17.137 --> 03:40:19.339 region:rollup2
FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN READING AND

03:40:18.305 --> 03:40:20.541 region:rollup2
FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN HEARING IS

03:40:19.339 --> 03:40:22.176 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S DOUBLE AHA

03:40:20.541 --> 03:40:23.544 region:rollup2
DISCOUNTS.

03:40:22.176 --> 03:40:24.645 region:rollup2
TO ME THAT MEANS THE STATE STILL

03:40:23.544 --> 03:40:26.480 region:rollup2
GETTING THE DISCOUNTS ARE STILL

03:40:24.645 --> 03:40:28.082 region:rollup2
GETTING THE REPEATS.

03:40:26.480 --> 03:40:29.817 region:rollup2
CORRECT AND SO IF THEY'RE

03:40:28.082 --> 03:40:30.951 region:rollup2
GETTING THAT I KNOW AND I'M

03:40:29.817 --> 03:40:32.019 region:rollup2
TRYING TO KIND OF VERBAL AND

03:40:30.951 --> 03:40:33.654 region:rollup2
THAT HERE SO IF YOU'RE STILL

03:40:32.019 --> 03:40:35.355 region:rollup2
GETTING THE BUT DISCOUNT AND

03:40:33.654 --> 03:40:36.790 region:rollup2
THEN THE THREE FORTY BE. ABOUT

03:40:35.355 --> 03:40:38.258 region:rollup2
FOLKS ARE GETTING THE DISCOUNT

03:40:36.790 --> 03:40:39.793 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ALREADY GETTING IN MY

03:40:38.258 --> 03:40:41.161 region:rollup2
MIND YOU'RE ALREADY GETTING.

03:40:39.793 --> 03:40:42.496 region:rollup2
THAT SAVING

03:40:41.161 --> 03:40:43.931 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY BEING

03:40:42.496 --> 03:40:45.532 region:rollup2
REALIZED BY WHAT I UNDERSTAND

03:40:43.931 --> 03:40:47.334 region:rollup2
THE DOUBLE.

03:40:45.532 --> 03:40:48.702 region:rollup2
OUT WE A REIMBURSEMENT MY

03:40:47.334 --> 03:40:51.738 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT.

03:40:48.702 --> 03:40:53.207 region:rollup2
AND FEDERAL ROUTE RULES BAR US

03:40:51.738 --> 03:40:54.508 region:rollup2
FROM GETTING THE DOUBLE

03:40:53.207 --> 03:40:56.376 region:rollup2
DISCOUNTS AND SO THERE ARE

03:40:54.508 --> 03:40:58.212 region:rollup2
PROCESSES IN PLACE.

03:40:56.376 --> 03:40:59.580 region:rollup2
TO PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING

03:40:58.212 --> 03:41:01.782 region:rollup2
NO NO I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT IN

03:40:59.580 --> 03:41:03.183 region:rollup2
THE MEAN RIGHT THIS MINUTE THERE

03:41:01.782 --> 03:41:03.817 region:rollup2
WERE STILL GETTING THE REBATES

03:41:03.183 --> 03:41:05.319 region:rollup2
THE STATE'S THEY'RE GETTING THE

03:41:03.817 --> 03:41:06.720 region:rollup2
REBATES AND THE POINT PEOPLE ARE

03:41:05.319 --> 03:41:08.255 region:rollup2
GETTING THE REBATE SO THEN. THE

03:41:06.720 --> 03:41:10.591 region:rollup2
SOUL I DON'T SEE WHERE THE

03:41:08.255 --> 03:41:11.792 region:rollup2
SAVINGS WOULD COME FROM BECAUSE

03:41:10.591 --> 03:41:13.827 region:rollup2
WE'RE ALREADY RECEIVING THE.

03:41:11.792 --> 03:41:15.963 region:rollup2
BUT REPEAT MY UNDERSTANDING IS

03:41:13.827 --> 03:41:18.132 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE NOT COLLECTING THE

03:41:15.963 --> 03:41:20.334 region:rollup2
MEDICAID REBATE ON THE ON THE

03:41:18.132 --> 03:41:22.136 region:rollup2
VAST MAJORITY PROBABLY OF THE

03:41:20.334 --> 03:41:22.970 region:rollup2
THREE FORTY BE DRUGS THAT ARE

03:41:22.136 --> 03:41:25.439 region:rollup2
TAGGED THAT WAY BUT I WOULD

03:41:22.970 --> 03:41:28.075 region:rollup2
DEFER TO THE DEPARTMENT. SO

03:41:25.439 --> 03:41:29.576 region:rollup2
BRING A MONOLOGUE SO. WHEN DRUGS

03:41:28.075 --> 03:41:31.545 region:rollup2
ARE BUILT TO THE DEPARTMENT

03:41:29.576 --> 03:41:33.147 region:rollup2
WE HAVE CERTAIN PRICING

03:41:31.545 --> 03:41:35.115 region:rollup2
METHODOLOGIES FOR HOW.

03:41:33.147 --> 03:41:36.650 region:rollup2
PHARMACIES CLINICS ARE SUPPOSED

03:41:35.115 --> 03:41:38.552 region:rollup2
TO BELLA'S.

03:41:36.650 --> 03:41:40.821 region:rollup2
IF THEY PARTICIPATE IN THE THREE

03:41:38.552 --> 03:41:42.256 region:rollup2
FORTY BE PROGRAM.

03:41:40.821 --> 03:41:44.024 region:rollup2
IT NEEDS TO BE SUBMITTED IN THE

03:41:42.256 --> 03:41:46.393 region:rollup2
CLAIM THAT THIS DRUG THAT HAS

03:41:44.024 --> 03:41:48.495 region:rollup2
BEEN DISPENSED COME REIMBURSED

03:41:46.393 --> 03:41:50.964 region:rollup2
IS A THREE FORTY BE DRUG.

03:41:48.495 --> 03:41:52.733 region:rollup2
WE DO NOT HAVE THAT TRANSPARENCY

03:41:50.964 --> 03:41:54.434 region:rollup2
IN TERMS ABOUT REPORTING FOR

03:41:52.733 --> 03:41:57.171 region:rollup2
THOSE DRUGS SO WHEN WE ENTER

03:41:54.434 --> 03:41:59.306 region:rollup2
INTO REBATE AGREEMENTS WITH

03:41:57.171 --> 03:42:01.975 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURERS AND THEN WE WORK

03:41:59.306 --> 03:42:04.478 region:rollup2
OUT. THE DRUGS THAT HAD BEEN.

03:42:01.975 --> 03:42:06.113 region:rollup2
AND REIMBURSE THE DEPARTMENT IF

03:42:04.478 --> 03:42:08.749 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT IDENTIFIED AS BEING

03:42:06.113 --> 03:42:10.984 region:rollup2
A THREE FORTY BE WE SUBMIT AN

03:42:08.749 --> 03:42:12.486 region:rollup2
INVOICE TO THAT MANUFACTURERS

03:42:10.984 --> 03:42:14.488 region:rollup2
THEY WILL COME BACK IN DISPUTE

03:42:12.486 --> 03:42:17.491 region:rollup2
AND SAY NO. THERE ARE THREE

03:42:14.488 --> 03:42:18.926 region:rollup2
FORTY BE DRUGS ON THIS INVOICE

03:42:17.491 --> 03:42:21.728 region:rollup2
AND SO THEN THEY LOOKED AT THE

03:42:18.926 --> 03:42:23.263 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT TO RECONCILE WHICH OF

03:42:21.728 --> 03:42:25.699 region:rollup2
THOSE DRUGS ORDER IN THAT

03:42:23.263 --> 03:42:28.001 region:rollup2
INVOICE ARE ACTUALLY THREE FORTY

03:42:25.699 --> 03:42:31.104 region:rollup2
BE DRUGS VERSUS NOT. AND UNTIL

03:42:28.001 --> 03:42:32.940 region:rollup2
WE CAN CLARIFY. INCORRECT THAT

03:42:31.104 --> 03:42:35.008 region:rollup2
DISPUTED INVOICE WHERE THEY'RE

03:42:32.940 --> 03:42:36.476 region:rollup2
NOT ABLE TO COLLECT THE REBATES

03:42:35.008 --> 03:42:37.878 region:rollup2
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

03:42:36.476 --> 03:42:39.346 region:rollup2
RIGHT BUT THEN IT SOUNDS TO ME

03:42:37.878 --> 03:42:41.782 region:rollup2
LIKE THAT IT'S A DEPARTMENT

03:42:39.346 --> 03:42:43.317 region:rollup2
ISSUE. BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE

03:42:41.782 --> 03:42:45.152 region:rollup2
THE PROPER.

03:42:43.317 --> 03:42:47.454 region:rollup2
FLORIDA CALLS OR WHATEVER IT IS

03:42:45.152 --> 03:42:49.523 region:rollup2
TO NOT SEND WELL THAT HAVES WE

03:42:47.454 --> 03:42:52.059 region:rollup2
HAVE STATE LAW THAT REQUIRES

03:42:49.523 --> 03:42:54.161 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATING ENTITIES IN THE

03:42:52.059 --> 03:42:56.296 region:rollup2
THREE FORTY BE PROGRAM. TED BILL

03:42:54.161 --> 03:42:57.998 region:rollup2
PASSED AT THE RATE IN WHICH THEY

03:42:56.296 --> 03:43:00.167 region:rollup2
ACQUIRED THE DRUG RIGHT UNDER

03:42:57.998 --> 03:43:03.637 region:rollup2
THREE FOUR GB SO IF IT'S NOT

03:43:00.167 --> 03:43:05.472 region:rollup2
BEING. COMMUNICATED TO WHAT'S.

03:43:03.637 --> 03:43:06.873 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE REIMBURSING NOT OR

03:43:05.472 --> 03:43:09.476 region:rollup2
THEY'RE CLAIMING TO US A

03:43:06.873 --> 03:43:10.744 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT AMOUNT WE DON'T KNOW

03:43:09.476 --> 03:43:12.379 region:rollup2
WHICH OF THOSE DRUGS ARE

03:43:10.744 --> 03:43:14.348 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY THREE FORTY BEAVER SAYS

03:43:12.379 --> 03:43:16.316 region:rollup2
NOT SO WE THEN DON'T PUT THOSE

03:43:14.348 --> 03:43:19.152 region:rollup2
CLAIMS. INTO THE SAME BUCKET

03:43:16.316 --> 03:43:19.653 region:rollup2
PROCLAIMING THE REBATES OR THE

GOVERNMENT.

03:43:20.954 --> 03:43:23.557 region:rollup2
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE

03:43:22.122 --> 03:43:25.225 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE A WAY TO BE ABLE TO

03:43:23.557 --> 03:43:27.327 region:rollup2
TRACK THOSE.

03:43:25.225 --> 03:43:28.528 region:rollup2
UP DRUGS I MEAN WHAT ONE OF THE

03:43:27.327 --> 03:43:30.230 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES BECAUSE IT WAS

03:43:28.528 --> 03:43:31.064 region:rollup2

PHARMACIES THAT ARE IN USE. BUT

03:43:57.224 --> 03:44:01.128 region:rollup2
WE ONLY HAVE ONE AGREEMENT RIGHT

03:43:59.359 --> 03:44:03.030 region:rollup2
NOW THAT WE ARE WHERE OUT WITH

03:44:01.128 --> 03:44:05.799 region:rollup2

THERE WAS A RECONCILIATION

03:44:28.889 --> 03:44:32.359 region:rollup2
PROCESS THAT IS HAPPENING

03:44:30.324 --> 03:44:34.161 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE MANUFACTURER AND THE

REIMBURSEMENT RATE IS THAT

03:44:42.602 --> 03:44:46.373 region:rollup2
SAVINGS. THAT IS BEING GENERATED

03:44:44.971 --> 03:44:48.241 region:rollup2
AND MAINTAINED BY THE THREE

FORTY BE ENTITIES TO DO THE

03:44:48.241 --> 03:44:52.112 region:rollup2

03:44:57.117 --> 03:45:01.054 region:rollup2
FOR ME WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE IS.

03:44:59.653 --> 03:45:02.389 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S JUST IN SIMPLE TERMS

03:45:01.054 --> 03:45:03.623 region:rollup2
AND OBVIOUSLY THE EXPERTS CAN

03:45:02.389 --> 03:45:05.292 region:rollup2
HELP ME LATER.

03:45:03.623 --> 03:45:06.259 region:rollup2

THREE FORTY BE PROGRAM

03:45:11.264 --> 03:45:14.868 region:rollup2
ALTOGETHER BECAUSE OF THOSE ARE

03:45:12.933 --> 03:45:16.436 region:rollup2
THERE ISSUES I MEAN. IT. I MEAN

03:45:14.868 --> 03:45:18.572 region:rollup2
AGAIN I'M.

03:45:16.436 --> 03:45:19.873 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY JUST TRYING TO.

03:45:18.572 --> 03:45:21.408 region:rollup2
GRAPH THE ISSUE IF I COULD

03:45:19.873 --> 03:45:22.976 region:rollup2
RESPOND TO THAT OUT WE HAVE

03:45:21.408 --> 03:45:23.910 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN CONTRACT PHARMACIES

03:45:22.976 --> 03:45:25.379 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE A THIRD PARTY

03:45:23.910 --> 03:45:27.214 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATOR. AND THE THIRD

03:45:25.379 --> 03:45:28.982 region:rollup2
PARTY ADMINISTRATOR TRACKS ALL

03:45:27.214 --> 03:45:30.917 region:rollup2
OF OUR THREE CORE AB MEDICATIONS

03:45:28.982 --> 03:45:32.185 region:rollup2
THROUGH OUR NPI NUMBER AND ALL

03:45:30.917 --> 03:45:33.820 region:rollup2
OF THOSE PHARMACEUTICALS THAT

03:45:32.185 --> 03:45:35.088 region:rollup2
ARE DISTRIBUTED OUT OF ANYONE OF

03:45:33.820 --> 03:45:37.524 region:rollup2
THOSE CONTRACT PHARMACIES ARE

03:45:35.088 --> 03:45:39.793 region:rollup2
RECONCILED MONTHLY. AND ANNUALLY

03:45:37.524 --> 03:45:41.661 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S THAT SYSTEM ALREADY

03:45:39.793 --> 03:45:43.263 region:rollup2
EXISTS AS A PATH FEDERALLY

03:45:41.661 --> 03:45:43.997 region:rollup2
QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER THERE'S

03:45:43.263 --> 03:45:45.565 region:rollup2
A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE

03:45:43.997 --> 03:45:46.933 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT AND THE REPORTING

03:45:45.565 --> 03:45:48.802 region:rollup2
TOOL.

03:45:46.933 --> 03:45:50.303 region:rollup2
OKAY UP SO THEN OKAY SO THAT'S

03:45:48.802 --> 03:45:52.272 region:rollup2
ONE ISSUE AND I THINK.

03:45:50.303 --> 03:45:53.073 region:rollup2
WE ALL AGREE THAT.

03:45:52.272 --> 03:45:54.808 region:rollup2
THIS IS A BIG ISSUE THAT CAN'T

03:45:53.073 --> 03:45:57.577 region:rollup2
BE SOLVED.

03:45:54.808 --> 03:46:00.180 region:rollup2
HERE ON. THE OTHER.

03:45:57.577 --> 03:46:01.715 region:rollup2
COMMENT I GUESS IS WE TALK

03:46:00.180 --> 03:46:03.116 region:rollup2
ABOUT THESE SAVINGS BEER BEING

03:46:01.715 --> 03:46:05.018 region:rollup2
REALIZED AND BEING ABLE TO USE

03:46:03.116 --> 03:46:06.887 region:rollup2
THOSE SAVINGS FOR OTHER PROGRAMS

03:46:05.018 --> 03:46:08.688 region:rollup2
BUT BY THE TIME WE REALLY

03:46:06.887 --> 03:46:11.358 region:rollup2
REALIZE THOSE SAVINGS.

03:46:08.688 --> 03:46:12.259 region:rollup2
IF THEY MAGICALLY APPEAR HOWEVER

03:46:11.358 --> 03:46:14.060 region:rollup2
WE PLAN ON APPEARING THEM.

03:46:12.259 --> 03:46:16.163 region:rollup2
.

03:46:14.060 --> 03:46:18.565 region:rollup2
IT COULD BE.

03:46:16.163 --> 03:46:21.168 region:rollup2
SAY A YEAR SO WE WOULDN'T BE

03:46:18.565 --> 03:46:22.903 region:rollup2
USING ANY OF THOSE SAVINGS

03:46:21.168 --> 03:46:25.272 region:rollup2
ANY TIME SOON ON TOTAL SAVINGS

03:46:22.903 --> 03:46:27.340 region:rollup2
ARE REALIZED IN THE MEANTIME.

03:46:25.272 --> 03:46:29.109 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE. I WILL BE

03:46:27.340 --> 03:46:30.577 region:rollup2
IMPACTED BECAUSE SERVICES WON'T

03:46:29.109 --> 03:46:32.779 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO BE PROVIDED WE CAN

03:46:30.577 --> 03:46:33.547 region:rollup2
AUGMENT THE. MEDICARE MEDICAID

03:46:32.779 --> 03:46:35.715 region:rollup2
WHATEVER.

03:46:33.547 --> 03:46:37.951 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT YOU'RE HOPING TO

03:46:35.715 --> 03:46:39.853 region:rollup2
AUGMENT WHAT THE SAVINGS UNTOLD

03:46:37.951 --> 03:46:41.254 region:rollup2
FAIR YEAR MAYBE ANOTHER YEAR AND

03:46:39.853 --> 03:46:43.723 region:rollup2
A HALF IN THE MEANTIME I'VE

03:46:41.254 --> 03:46:44.691 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES THAT. ARE GOING TO

03:46:43.723 --> 03:46:46.393 region:rollup2
BE.

03:46:44.691 --> 03:46:49.062 region:rollup2
HUGELY IMPACTED

03:46:46.393 --> 03:46:52.165 region:rollup2
BY THIS.

03:46:49.062 --> 03:46:54.835 region:rollup2
TRANSITION SO.

03:46:52.165 --> 03:46:56.970 region:rollup2
I I A AGAIN.

03:46:54.835 --> 03:46:58.972 region:rollup2
WANT TO BE TRANSPARENT BY.

03:46:56.970 --> 03:47:01.174 region:rollup2
AT WHAT COST IN THE MEANTIME I

03:46:58.972 --> 03:47:02.375 region:rollup2
THINK THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT IT

03:47:01.174 --> 03:47:04.511 region:rollup2
SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY'S WILLING

03:47:02.375 --> 03:47:05.078 region:rollup2
TO SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT THE

03:47:04.511 --> 03:47:06.379 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS AND THEY

03:47:05.078 --> 03:47:07.814 region:rollup2
DON'T.

03:47:06.379 --> 03:47:08.815 region:rollup2
THERE COMPLICATED I THINK WERE

03:47:07.814 --> 03:47:09.516 region:rollup2
OVER COMPLICATING THEM BUT IT

03:47:08.815 --> 03:47:11.284 region:rollup2
SOUNDS LIKE.

03:47:09.516 --> 03:47:13.487 region:rollup2
THERE'S.

03:47:11.284 --> 03:47:16.022 region:rollup2
FOLKS THAT ARE ALREADY WORKING

03:47:13.487 --> 03:47:17.958 region:rollup2
WITH. ART THERE PROVIDERS OR OR

03:47:16.022 --> 03:47:19.759 region:rollup2
PHARMACIES AND THEN SOMEBODY

03:47:17.958 --> 03:47:21.561 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THIRD PARTY LIKE

03:47:19.759 --> 03:47:23.563 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT PERSON THAT IS TAKING

03:47:21.561 --> 03:47:25.298 region:rollup2
CARE OF THAT SO IT JUST SEEMS TO

03:47:23.563 --> 03:47:27.801 region:rollup2
ME THAT THAT COULD BE. A

03:47:25.298 --> 03:47:29.069 region:rollup2
SOLUTION FOR US AS WELL ON.

03:47:27.801 --> 03:47:30.470 region:rollup2
ANYTHING BUT THAT'S JUST MY

03:47:29.069 --> 03:47:32.072 region:rollup2
COMMENTS BY.

03:47:30.470 --> 03:47:34.307 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL OF THESE

03:47:32.072 --> 03:47:36.042 region:rollup2
ISSUES. WAYS OF FIXING IT OR NOT

03:47:34.307 --> 03:47:37.577 region:rollup2
FIXING ADD.

03:47:36.042 --> 03:47:39.179 region:rollup2
ELIMINATING IT RIGHT AWAY

03:47:37.577 --> 03:47:40.747 region:rollup2
DOESN'T THAT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE

03:47:39.179 --> 03:47:41.882 region:rollup2
WE'RE PREPARED TO ELIMINATE IT

03:47:40.747 --> 03:47:43.683 region:rollup2
RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T

03:47:41.882 --> 03:47:45.385 region:rollup2
REALLY TALKED ABOUT.

03:47:43.683 --> 03:47:46.887 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS POSSIBLE

03:47:45.385 --> 03:47:48.688 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN THE

03:47:46.887 --> 03:47:51.324 region:rollup2
HEALTH CENTERS ALL OF THEM.

03:47:48.688 --> 03:47:53.460 region:rollup2
AND THE STATE AND TRYING TO.

03:47:51.324 --> 03:47:55.695 region:rollup2
I FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN DO THIS

03:47:53.460 --> 03:47:58.031 region:rollup2
WITHOUT BUT THE LEAST IMPACT.

03:47:55.695 --> 03:47:59.766 region:rollup2
YES ON THE THE.

03:47:58.031 --> 03:48:01.268 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS OF THE SERVICES BUT

03:47:59.766 --> 03:48:02.335 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY THE FOLKS THERE

03:48:01.268 --> 03:48:03.870 region:rollup2
RECEIVING THEIR CERTAIN THE

03:48:02.335 --> 03:48:05.805 region:rollup2
SERVICES WON'T BE RECEIVING THE

03:48:03.870 --> 03:48:07.574 region:rollup2
SERVICES BECAUSE ALL OF THESE

03:48:05.805 --> 03:48:09.175 region:rollup2
HEALTH CENTERS. ARE BEING

03:48:07.574 --> 03:48:11.077 region:rollup2
IMPACTED SOLD.

03:48:09.175 --> 03:48:11.845 region:rollup2
I CAN GO ON AND WE CAN CONTINUE

03:48:11.077 --> 03:48:13.280 region:rollup2
THE CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW POINT

03:48:11.845 --> 03:48:15.315 region:rollup2
OF.

03:48:13.280 --> 03:48:16.383 region:rollup2
MY LONG WINDED.

03:48:15.315 --> 03:48:18.818 region:rollup2
I CONVERSATION AS.

03:48:16.383 --> 03:48:21.288 region:rollup2
TO.

03:48:18.818 --> 03:48:22.923 region:rollup2
EXPRESS HOW MUCH MORE WE NEED TO

03:48:21.288 --> 03:48:24.758 region:rollup2
WORK ON TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS

03:48:22.923 --> 03:48:26.259 region:rollup2
DOESN'T IMPACT.

03:48:24.758 --> 03:48:28.228 region:rollup2
MAINLY FOR ME THE BIGGEST

03:48:26.259 --> 03:48:30.430 region:rollup2
CONCERN IS AS THE COMMUNITIES

SOLUTION WOULD BE.

03:48:40.307 --> 03:48:44.511 region:rollup2
FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED BUT AGAIN

03:48:42.576 --> 03:48:46.479 region:rollup2
FOR ME THE MAIN CONCERN IS THE

03:48:44.511 --> 03:48:47.514 region:rollup2
PUBLIC AND THOSE COMMUNITIES

03:48:46.479 --> 03:48:49.015 region:rollup2

ENOUGH AXES THAT'S IT IS AND

03:48:50.684 --> 03:48:53.954 region:rollup2
THEN IT WOULD THE IMPACT WOULD

HAVE WAY LET'S AXES AND SO

03:48:53.954 --> 03:48:57.090 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF HELPING OR HURTING

03:48:56.089 --> 03:48:59.192 region:rollup2
THEM EVEN IF IT'S.

03:48:57.090 --> 03:49:00.393 region:rollup2
TEMPORARY BECAUSE IT SOUNDS

03:48:59.192 --> 03:49:02.195 region:rollup2
THAT EVEN THOUGH.

03:49:00.393 --> 03:49:03.930 region:rollup2
EVEN IF WE ELIMINATE THE PROGRAM

03:49:02.195 --> 03:49:05.398 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW THOUGH SAVINGS WON'T

03:49:03.930 --> 03:49:06.800 region:rollup2

THOSE COMMUNITIES DO.

03:49:08.301 --> 03:49:10.270 region:rollup2
TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT HOW THE

03:49:09.836 --> 03:49:14.274 region:rollup2
CONSERVE THE THE THE

03:49:10.270 --> 03:49:16.243 region:rollup2

03:49:36.096 --> 03:49:39.065 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE

03:49:37.597 --> 03:49:40.400 region:rollup2
ELIMINATION IT REQUIRES

03:49:39.065 --> 03:49:42.168 region:rollup2

BUT BECAUSE OF THE CHALLENGES

03:51:23.636 --> 03:51:26.639 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED AS WHY

03:51:25.338 --> 03:51:27.841 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THE PROPOSAL ON THE

03:51:26.639 --> 03:51:29.809 region:rollup2
TABLE TODAY.

03:51:27.841 --> 03:51:32.412 region:rollup2
IT THUMB WHEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER

RUBIO WAS SPEAKING IT DOES SEEM

03:51:32.412 --> 03:51:36.516 region:rollup2
THAT THE PARTNERSHIP HEALTH PLAN

IS A POTENTIAL MODEL FOR US TO.

03:51:36.516 --> 03:51:39.986 region:rollup2
LOOK AT AS A AN EXAMPLE OF PILOT

03:51:39.419 --> 03:51:41.921 region:rollup2
IF YOU WELL THAT HAS WORKED

03:51:39.986 --> 03:51:43.623 region:rollup2

POTENTIAL. PATH FORWARD I MEAN

03:51:50.230 --> 03:51:54.601 region:rollup2
THAT IS ONE OPTION BUT I THINK

03:51:52.065 --> 03:51:58.571 region:rollup2
AGAIN ONE OF THAT THE UNDERLYING

03:51:54.601 --> 03:52:01.241 region:rollup2
ISSUES HERE IS. THAT SAVINGS

03:51:58.571 --> 03:52:03.276 region:rollup2

THAT CEILING PRICES.

03:52:08.715 --> 03:52:11.384 region:rollup2
WE'LL LEARN ABOUT

03:52:18.425 --> 03:52:21.494 region:rollup2
THERE IS A CEILING PRICE OF

03:52:19.793 --> 03:52:23.930 region:rollup2
THREE FORTY BE. THERE'S SOME

03:52:21.494 --> 03:52:25.298 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE IN BETWEEN THERE AND

03:52:23.930 --> 03:52:26.900 region:rollup2
MOM WE REIMBURSE FOR.

03:52:25.298 --> 03:52:28.635 region:rollup2
.

03:52:26.900 --> 03:52:30.370 region:rollup2
MEDICATIONS IN THE PROGRAM WE'RE

03:52:28.635 --> 03:52:32.539 region:rollup2
LOOKING TO REIMBURSE AB WHAT THE

03:52:30.370 --> 03:52:34.240 region:rollup2
DRUG WAS ACQUIRED FOR.

03:52:32.539 --> 03:52:37.544 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU ACQUIRED THE DRUG JUST

03:52:34.240 --> 03:52:39.078 region:rollup2
AS AN EXAMPLE FOR TEN DOLLARS.

03:52:37.544 --> 03:52:40.213 region:rollup2
WE WOULD THEN LOOK TO REIMBURSE

03:52:39.078 --> 03:52:41.681 region:rollup2
YOU WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THREE

03:52:40.213 --> 03:52:43.249 region:rollup2

TO SAY TWENTY DOLLARS

03:52:49.989 --> 03:52:53.259 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S THAT DIFFERENCE

03:52:51.224 --> 03:52:54.894 region:rollup2
MATT'S BREAD. THAT IS THEM BEING

03:52:53.259 --> 03:52:56.696 region:rollup2
MAINTAINED BY THE THREE FOUR TO

03:52:54.894 --> 03:52:57.964 region:rollup2
BE ENTITIES TO DO THE THINGS

03:52:56.696 --> 03:53:00.633 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT

03:52:57.964 --> 03:53:03.102 region:rollup2
HERE BUT. THERE IS NO. FOR

03:53:00.633 --> 03:53:04.470 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY IN TERMS OF HOW

03:53:03.102 --> 03:53:05.905 region:rollup2
THOSE MONIES ARE THEN BE AND

03:53:04.470 --> 03:53:07.607 region:rollup2
UTILIZE WHETHER IT'S FOR THE

03:53:05.905 --> 03:53:10.210 region:rollup2
MEDICAID PROGRAM OR FOR

03:53:07.607 --> 03:53:11.211 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS THAT ARE UNINSURED

03:53:10.210 --> 03:53:14.080 region:rollup2
TODAY.

03:53:11.211 --> 03:53:16.249 region:rollup2
SO THAT THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE

03:53:14.080 --> 03:53:18.318 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT.

03:53:16.249 --> 03:53:20.253 region:rollup2
HAS COME TO OUR ATTENTION AND

03:53:18.318 --> 03:53:22.188 region:rollup2
THAT WAS ALSO IDENTIFIED FROM LA

03:53:20.253 --> 03:53:24.357 region:rollup2
OR RECOMMENDATIONS BUT AGAIN WE

03:53:22.188 --> 03:53:26.459 region:rollup2
DO WERE REMAIN COMMITTED. IN

03:53:24.357 --> 03:53:28.761 region:rollup2
TERMS OF SITTING DOWN WITH FOLKS

03:53:26.459 --> 03:53:31.164 region:rollup2
TO TALK THROUGH SOME OPTIONS

03:53:28.761 --> 03:53:32.732 region:rollup2
THAT WE MAY WANT TO RECONSIDER

03:53:31.164 --> 03:53:34.567 region:rollup2
AND MAY LOOK TO PRESENT AT MAY

03:53:32.732 --> 03:53:37.403 region:rollup2
REVISE WHAT DOES THE STATE

03:53:34.567 --> 03:53:38.905 region:rollup2
EXPECT WILL HAPPEN TO THE FQHCS

03:53:37.403 --> 03:53:40.373 region:rollup2
OUR SAFETY NET. HOSPITALS

03:53:38.905 --> 03:53:43.710 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THE THREE FORTY BE

03:53:40.373 --> 03:53:45.278 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

03:53:43.710 --> 03:53:47.480 region:rollup2
AGAIN WE WOULD BE LOOKING THAT

03:53:45.278 --> 03:53:49.916 region:rollup2
REIMBURSING THEM AT COST

03:53:47.480 --> 03:53:52.285 region:rollup2
FOR FOR PURPOSES OF THAT.

03:53:49.916 --> 03:53:54.754 region:rollup2
DISPENSING OF MEDICATIONS

03:53:52.285 --> 03:53:55.255 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND A

03:53:54.754 --> 03:53:58.291 region:rollup2
FOR REIMBURSING THEM ACT

03:53:55.255 --> 03:54:00.460 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

03:53:58.291 --> 03:54:02.428 region:rollup2
THEN WHAT'S THE LOS

03:54:00.460 --> 03:54:04.464 region:rollup2
TO THOSE CLINICS WHAT THE LAW

03:54:02.428 --> 03:54:06.933 region:rollup2
SAYS IS THE DIFFERENCE IN TERMS

03:54:04.464 --> 03:54:08.134 region:rollup2
OF THEM THAT THE SAVINGS THAT

03:54:06.933 --> 03:54:10.370 region:rollup2
THEY GENERATE BECAUSE THEN WE'RE

03:54:08.134 --> 03:54:12.105 region:rollup2
BEING BILLED. AT A HIGHER RATE

03:54:10.370 --> 03:54:13.006 region:rollup2
THEM WHAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY

03:54:12.105 --> 03:54:14.774 region:rollup2
THEM WHAT THE DRUG WAS ACTUALLY

03:54:13.006 --> 03:54:16.509 region:rollup2
ACQUIRED.

03:54:14.774 --> 03:54:18.044 region:rollup2
THE.

03:54:16.509 --> 03:54:20.580 region:rollup2
I'M STRUGGLING A BIT WITH THAT

03:54:18.044 --> 03:54:22.415 region:rollup2
ANSWER AND DO YOU HAVE TO SHARE

03:54:20.580 --> 03:54:23.483 region:rollup2
THAT SENTIMENT THAT I. BELIEVE

03:54:22.415 --> 03:54:25.518 region:rollup2
THIS WILL BE DETRIMENTAL TO

03:54:23.483 --> 03:54:28.087 region:rollup2
ACCESS AND. AFFECT MANY OF OUR

03:54:25.518 --> 03:54:30.156 region:rollup2

03:54:28.087 --> 03:54:32.358 region:rollup2
MY COMMUNITY NEEDS AND REALLY.

03:54:30.156 --> 03:54:34.460 region:rollup2
.

03:54:32.358 --> 03:54:36.329 region:rollup2
STRUGGLE WITH THAT ANSWER BUT

03:54:34.460 --> 03:54:37.931 region:rollup2
WILL LOOK TURF HAVING FURTHER

03:54:36.329 --> 03:54:40.967 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS REGARDING THAT

03:54:37.931 --> 03:54:42.101 region:rollup2
UNDERSTOOD BUT IF IF I CAN. WEEK

03:54:40.967 --> 03:54:44.737 region:rollup2
WE HEARD THAT THE STATE GETS TO

03:54:42.101 --> 03:54:46.239 region:rollup2
KEEP A THIRD OF THE SAVINGS AND

03:54:44.737 --> 03:54:48.074 region:rollup2
WE'RE GIVING BACK TWO THIRDS.

03:54:46.239 --> 03:54:49.742 region:rollup2
I WAS HOPING YOU COULD EXPAND ON

03:54:48.074 --> 03:54:51.744 region:rollup2
THAT A LITTLE BIT TO.

03:54:49.742 --> 03:54:53.279 region:rollup2
EXPLAIN WHY THAT WOULD BE BETTER

03:54:51.744 --> 03:54:56.649 region:rollup2
FOR OUR STATE.

03:54:53.279 --> 03:54:58.751 region:rollup2
THEN WHAT WE HAVE NOW.

03:54:56.649 --> 03:55:00.453 region:rollup2
I MEAN PART OF IT IS WHAT WE'RE

03:54:58.751 --> 03:55:01.321 region:rollup2
WORK HARD TO GET BACK TO THE

03:55:00.453 --> 03:55:02.889 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NUMBER

03:55:01.321 --> 03:55:04.724 region:rollup2
SHARING IN SAVINGS BECAUSE THE

03:55:02.889 --> 03:55:06.593 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS FINANCE.

03:55:04.724 --> 03:55:07.760 region:rollup2
IN PART WITH FEDERAL DOLLARS

03:55:06.593 --> 03:55:09.595 region:rollup2
SO WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE

03:55:07.760 --> 03:55:10.897 region:rollup2
FEDERAL SHARING RATIO THAT'S

03:55:09.595 --> 03:55:12.899 region:rollup2
JUST A REQUIREMENT A

03:55:10.897 --> 03:55:14.934 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATING AND ON THE FEDERAL

03:55:12.899 --> 03:55:16.436 region:rollup2
REBATE PROGRAM WE ALSO HAVE A

03:55:14.934 --> 03:55:18.504 region:rollup2
STATE REBATE PROGRAM WHICH IS

03:55:16.436 --> 03:55:20.006 region:rollup2
SEPARATE AND APART. FROM THE

03:55:18.504 --> 03:55:20.506 region:rollup2
THREE FORTY BE BUT THE GOAL OF

03:55:20.006 --> 03:55:23.710 region:rollup2
THREE FORTY BE WISE TO.

03:55:20.506 --> 03:55:25.612 region:rollup2
MAXIMIZE.

03:55:23.710 --> 03:55:27.981 region:rollup2
.

03:55:25.612 --> 03:55:30.850 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT LOW COST

03:55:27.981 --> 03:55:33.319 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF PROGRAM OPERATIONS.

03:55:30.850 --> 03:55:34.687 region:rollup2
TO IF WE'RE GIVING A TWO THIRDS

03:55:33.319 --> 03:55:36.689 region:rollup2
OF THE DOLLARS BACK DOES THAT

03:55:34.687 --> 03:55:38.391 region:rollup2
BENEFIT OUR SYSTEM.

03:55:36.689 --> 03:55:39.959 region:rollup2
WELL YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT WHERE

03:55:38.391 --> 03:55:41.461 region:rollup2
WE ACTUALLY THEN SPENDING FOR

03:55:39.959 --> 03:55:43.229 region:rollup2
THE COST OF THOSE SERVICES

03:55:41.461 --> 03:55:44.530 region:rollup2
BECAUSE NOW RIGHT NOW IT WOULD

03:55:43.229 --> 03:55:46.566 region:rollup2
APPEAR THAT WERE.

03:55:44.530 --> 03:55:48.234 region:rollup2
OVER SPEND.

03:55:46.566 --> 03:55:50.103 region:rollup2
AND I I RECOGNIZE THAT THE

03:55:48.234 --> 03:55:52.472 region:rollup2
CONCERN RAISED BY A PART OF IT

03:55:50.103 --> 03:55:54.841 region:rollup2
IS HOW THE REBATE PROGRAM WORKS

03:55:52.472 --> 03:55:56.275 region:rollup2
BUT THEN IF THERE ARE SAVINGS

03:55:54.841 --> 03:55:58.478 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE ARE SAVINGS THAT

03:55:56.275 --> 03:56:00.346 region:rollup2
ARE OUT THERE. BETTER NOT BE

03:55:58.478 --> 03:56:00.980 region:rollup2
INPUT AND FIND THE LEGISLATURE

03:56:00.346 --> 03:56:02.849 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY MAKING THEM DECISION.

03:56:00.980 --> 03:56:03.983 region:rollup2
WHAT?

03:56:02.849 --> 03:56:06.119 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU ANTICIPATE THOSE

03:56:03.983 --> 03:56:07.620 region:rollup2
SAVINGS WOULD BE USED FOR.

03:56:06.119 --> 03:56:09.122 region:rollup2
WHY THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE A

03:56:07.620 --> 03:56:10.323 region:rollup2
DECISION FOR THE LEGISLATURE

03:56:09.122 --> 03:56:11.791 region:rollup2
TOTAL WHEN I AM WHO I AM I

03:56:10.323 --> 03:56:13.593 region:rollup2
READING GENERAL FUND THEN

03:56:11.791 --> 03:56:15.028 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I? GUESS BECAUSE WE DO

03:56:13.593 --> 03:56:17.597 region:rollup2
NOT CONTROL THE USE OF THE

03:56:15.028 --> 03:56:19.766 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND SO I STRUGGLE WHEN.

03:56:17.597 --> 03:56:20.299 region:rollup2
OUR SYSTEMS ARE STRESSED AS THEY

03:56:19.766 --> 03:56:22.402 region:rollup2
ARE TO CONSIDER THAT WERE

03:56:20.299 --> 03:56:25.171 region:rollup2
TAKING.

03:56:22.402 --> 03:56:27.273 region:rollup2
LIMITED HEALTHCARE DOLLARS AND

03:56:25.171 --> 03:56:28.975 region:rollup2
SENDING TWO THIRDS OF THEM. BACK

03:56:27.273 --> 03:56:30.910 region:rollup2
TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND

03:56:28.975 --> 03:56:31.711 region:rollup2
THEN POSSIBLY RE DEDICATING THE

03:56:30.910 --> 03:56:33.212 region:rollup2
OTHER THIRD TOWARDS OTHER

03:56:31.711 --> 03:56:34.914 region:rollup2
SOURCES.

03:56:33.212 --> 03:56:37.383 region:rollup2
THERE WERE ACTUALLY IMPROVING

03:56:34.914 --> 03:56:39.085 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO CARE INSTEAD OF.

03:56:37.383 --> 03:56:39.952 region:rollup2
INHIBITING IT IN SOME TRYING TO

03:56:39.085 --> 03:56:44.157 region:rollup2
REALLY GET A SENSE.

03:56:39.952 --> 03:56:46.159 region:rollup2
.

03:56:44.157 --> 03:56:47.894 region:rollup2
IF NO OTHER STATES ARE TRYING TO

03:56:46.159 --> 03:56:49.829 region:rollup2
DO THIS IF.

03:56:47.894 --> 03:56:51.364 region:rollup2
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AND WE

03:56:49.829 --> 03:56:53.633 region:rollup2
HAVE A POTENTIAL PATH FORWARD

03:56:51.364 --> 03:56:55.835 region:rollup2
WITH A PLAN IN OUR COMMUNITY

03:56:53.633 --> 03:56:57.570 region:rollup2
WIRE WE NOT LOOKING AT THAT.

03:56:55.835 --> 03:56:59.605 region:rollup2
AS OUR PATH FORWARD.

03:56:57.570 --> 03:57:01.040 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN THE ELIMINATION.

03:56:59.605 --> 03:57:02.642 region:rollup2
I THINK AGAIN THAT THAT

03:57:01.040 --> 03:57:04.010 region:rollup2
SOMETHING FOR CONSIDERATION I

03:57:02.642 --> 03:57:05.912 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THAT THEY'RE YOU

03:57:04.010 --> 03:57:08.014 region:rollup2
KNOW STATES. IT'S NOT SOMETHING

03:57:05.912 --> 03:57:09.949 region:rollup2
THAT HAS BEEN PUT FORWARD TO SEE

03:57:08.014 --> 03:57:11.951 region:rollup2
A MASS THEY HAVE OTHER STATES

03:57:09.949 --> 03:57:14.287 region:rollup2
HAVE PUT FOR REQUIREMENTS WHERE

03:57:11.951 --> 03:57:15.688 region:rollup2
THEY DO A LEMONADE. AYE THE USE

03:57:14.287 --> 03:57:17.690 region:rollup2
OF CONTRACT FORMS.

03:57:15.688 --> 03:57:19.425 region:rollup2
SO THERE AS MORE OF A A DIRECT

03:57:17.690 --> 03:57:21.561 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP OF WHAT THE

03:57:19.425 --> 03:57:23.329 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS WILL ACTUALLY BELL AND

03:57:21.561 --> 03:57:25.198 region:rollup2
THEN IDENTIFY FOR THOSE SURPLUS.

03:57:23.329 --> 03:57:27.133 region:rollup2
OUT AND WITH THIS IF I CAN

03:57:25.198 --> 03:57:29.302 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE MOTHER WHO

03:57:27.133 --> 03:57:31.170 region:rollup2
TESTIFIED SAID IT BEST.

03:57:29.302 --> 03:57:32.772 region:rollup2
SHE SAID TO URGE THE STATE TO

03:57:31.170 --> 03:57:33.773 region:rollup2
FIND AN ALTERNATIVE.

03:57:32.772 --> 03:57:35.408 region:rollup2
WITHOUT AFFECTING OUR CENTERS

03:57:33.773 --> 03:57:36.843 region:rollup2
FOR EXCELLENCE.

03:57:35.408 --> 03:57:38.411 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT SAYS IT WELL AND I

03:57:36.843 --> 03:57:40.680 region:rollup2
HOPE THAT DEPARTMENT FINDS AN

03:57:38.411 --> 03:57:41.848 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO. REACH OUT TO THE

03:57:40.680 --> 03:57:42.915 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS AND FIND A

03:57:41.848 --> 03:57:45.318 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS THAT BEST FOR THE

03:57:42.915 --> 03:57:46.886 region:rollup2
STATE.

03:57:45.318 --> 03:57:47.887 region:rollup2
I JUST WANT ONE OUR LAST

03:57:46.886 --> 03:57:48.387 region:rollup2
QUESTION THERE IS A COMMENT

03:57:47.887 --> 03:57:50.790 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

03:57:48.387 --> 03:57:52.525 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SOME OF THESE CLINICS

03:57:50.790 --> 03:57:55.261 region:rollup2
CAN PARTICIPATE IN THREE FORTY

03:57:52.525 --> 03:57:55.661 region:rollup2
BE THAT THEY HAVE. EITHER A

03:57:55.261 --> 03:57:57.330 region:rollup2
REALLY EXPENSIVE.

03:57:55.661 --> 03:57:59.532 region:rollup2
.

03:57:57.330 --> 03:58:01.767 region:rollup2
A ACCESS OR NO ACCESS TO SOME OF

03:57:59.532 --> 03:58:03.369 region:rollup2
THESE DRUGS AND HOW. DO WE

03:58:01.767 --> 03:58:04.837 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT FOR THAT FOR SOME OF

03:58:03.369 --> 03:58:07.073 region:rollup2
THESE FOLKS ARE IF I HEARD YOU

03:58:04.837 --> 03:58:09.509 region:rollup2
CORRECTLY IS.

03:58:07.073 --> 03:58:11.744 region:rollup2
IF HOW WOULD WE.

03:58:09.509 --> 03:58:12.879 region:rollup2
THE ABLE ACCESS OR SOME OF THESE

03:58:11.744 --> 03:58:14.981 region:rollup2
FOLKS BE ABLE TO ACCESS THOSE

03:58:12.879 --> 03:58:17.016 region:rollup2
NEEDED.

03:58:14.981 --> 03:58:18.684 region:rollup2
UGH DRUGS IF NOW THEY CAN'T

03:58:17.016 --> 03:58:19.285 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM AND

03:58:18.684 --> 03:58:20.319 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR

03:58:19.285 --> 03:58:22.021 region:rollup2
DRUGS.

03:58:20.319 --> 03:58:24.323 region:rollup2
BUT THREE FORTY BEE IS JUST ONE

03:58:22.021 --> 03:58:26.926 region:rollup2
WAY IN TERMS OF GETTING DRUGS

03:58:24.323 --> 03:58:29.095 region:rollup2
PROVIDED. OTHERWISE THROUGH OUR

03:58:26.926 --> 03:58:30.930 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT POLICIES WE THEN

03:58:29.095 --> 03:58:32.632 region:rollup2
REIMBURSE AT THE COST OF THE

03:58:30.930 --> 03:58:34.867 region:rollup2
DRUG THAT WAS ACQUIRED BY THE

03:58:32.632 --> 03:58:38.404 region:rollup2
ENTITY. THEIR REIMBURSE AT THAT

03:58:34.867 --> 03:58:40.406 region:rollup2
AMOUNT PLUS THE DISPENSING FEE.

03:58:38.404 --> 03:58:41.374 region:rollup2
IT OKAY IF YOU COULD CLARIFY FOR

03:58:40.406 --> 03:58:43.376 region:rollup2
ME BECAUSE I'LL BE HAPPY TO HEAR

03:58:41.374 --> 03:58:45.878 region:rollup2
THAT SO AND THE MODEL THAT RAINY

03:58:43.376 --> 03:58:47.547 region:rollup2
IS REFERRING TO IS IN THAT FEE

03:58:45.878 --> 03:58:49.816 region:rollup2
FOR SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM. SO

03:58:47.547 --> 03:58:50.850 region:rollup2
TODAY COVERED ENTITIES DO NOT

03:58:49.816 --> 03:58:52.685 region:rollup2
READ ANYTHING YOU THINGS FROM

03:58:50.850 --> 03:58:54.053 region:rollup2
THREE FORTY BE. IN FEE FOR

03:58:52.685 --> 03:58:55.888 region:rollup2
SERVICE WHICH IS ABOUT TWENTY

03:58:54.053 --> 03:58:57.557 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE MEDI CAL BOOK

03:58:55.888 --> 03:58:59.659 region:rollup2
BUSINESS. THE REMAINING EIGHTY

03:58:57.557 --> 03:59:01.394 region:rollup2
PERCENT THOUGH IS REIMBURSED

03:58:59.659 --> 03:59:02.962 region:rollup2
BASED ON PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED

03:59:01.394 --> 03:59:04.997 region:rollup2
CONTRACTS BETWEEN HEALTH PLANS

03:59:02.962 --> 03:59:06.199 region:rollup2
AND HOSPITALS SOMETIMES AS

03:59:04.997 --> 03:59:07.366 region:rollup2
HEALTH PLANS PACKED WITH THE XIN

03:59:06.199 --> 03:59:08.701 region:rollup2
COST FROM THEM THEY PAY MORE

03:59:07.366 --> 03:59:10.937 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES AT LAST THAT'S ALL

03:59:08.701 --> 03:59:12.972 region:rollup2
PART OF THE NEGOTIATION. BUT IF

03:59:10.937 --> 03:59:15.241 region:rollup2
WE CAN NO LONGER PARTICIPATE IN

03:59:12.972 --> 03:59:17.043 region:rollup2
THREE FORTY BE FOR THIS MEDI CAL

03:59:15.241 --> 03:59:18.511 region:rollup2
MANAGED CARE BOOK OF BUSINESS.

03:59:17.043 --> 03:59:20.046 region:rollup2
THAT MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL

03:59:18.511 --> 03:59:23.216 region:rollup2
AYE THREE FORTY HOSPITALS

03:59:20.046 --> 03:59:23.983 region:rollup2
PURCHASE THOSE DRUGS AT

03:59:23.216 --> 03:59:25.418 region:rollup2
WHOLESALE ACQUISITION COSTS

03:59:23.983 --> 03:59:26.652 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE FEDERAL RULES SAY.

03:59:25.418 --> 03:59:28.688 region:rollup2
YOU CANNOT BE PART OF A GROUP

03:59:26.652 --> 03:59:30.223 region:rollup2
PURCHASING ORGANIZATION IF YOU

03:59:28.688 --> 03:59:31.557 region:rollup2
ARE A THREE FORTY BE COVERED

03:59:30.223 --> 03:59:33.559 region:rollup2
ENTITY.

03:59:31.557 --> 03:59:35.761 region:rollup2
SO YOU KNOW THE BEST WAY I CAN

03:59:33.559 --> 03:59:36.762 region:rollup2
EXPLAIN IT PERHAPS AS. WE CAN

03:59:35.761 --> 03:59:37.830 region:rollup2
EVEN GO TO COST GOING GET THESE

03:59:36.762 --> 03:59:39.498 region:rollup2
DRUGS WE HAVE TO GO TO RITE AID

03:59:37.830 --> 03:59:40.900 region:rollup2
AND GET THEM NOW AND THAT IS THE

03:59:39.498 --> 03:59:42.602 region:rollup2
MOST EXPENSIVE DRUG ON THE

03:59:40.900 --> 03:59:43.436 region:rollup2
MARKET RIGHT NOW. AND THEN WE'RE

03:59:42.602 --> 03:59:45.671 region:rollup2
GOING TO GET PAID BY THE

03:59:43.436 --> 03:59:46.939 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT NOT AT. OUR.

03:59:45.671 --> 03:59:48.341 region:rollup2
ACQUISITION BECAUSE IT STILL PER

03:59:46.939 --> 03:59:50.042 region:rollup2
THAT CONTRACT THAT WE NEGOTIATED

03:59:48.341 --> 03:59:51.310 region:rollup2
WITH THE PLAN SO THE PLAN THIRTY

03:59:50.042 --> 03:59:52.778 region:rollup2
TOLD US WERE PAYING YOU TWENTY

03:59:51.310 --> 03:59:54.480 region:rollup2
DOLLARS FOR THAT DRUG WE DON'T

03:59:52.778 --> 03:59:56.249 region:rollup2
CARE IF YOU BOUGHT IT AT RITE

03:59:54.480 --> 03:59:58.251 region:rollup2
AID FOR FIFTY DOLLARS OR IF YOU

03:59:56.249 --> 03:59:59.819 region:rollup2
BOUGHT IT AT COSTCO FOR FORTY OR

03:59:58.251 --> 04:00:00.586 region:rollup2
ON. THREE FORTY BE FOR TEN. IT

03:59:59.819 --> 04:00:02.088 region:rollup2
DOESN'T MATTER TO US WE'VE

04:00:00.586 --> 04:00:03.122 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATED THAT THIS IS WHAT

04:00:02.088 --> 04:00:04.657 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GETTING PAID FOR THAT

04:00:03.122 --> 04:00:07.159 region:rollup2
DRUG SO WE WILL HAVE TO PAY

04:00:04.657 --> 04:00:09.195 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IF WE CAN'T

04:00:07.159 --> 04:00:11.264 region:rollup2
BUY THESE JOGGED THREE FORTY BE.

04:00:09.195 --> 04:00:12.665 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S GOING DEBT. AGAIN BE

04:00:11.264 --> 04:00:14.400 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

04:00:12.665 --> 04:00:16.202 region:rollup2
FOR HOUSE.

04:00:14.400 --> 04:00:17.603 region:rollup2
THANK YOU AND THE AND I DON'T

04:00:16.202 --> 04:00:21.407 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT THE THE NEXT.

04:00:17.603 --> 04:00:22.675 region:rollup2
STEP WOULD BE BUT I THINK THAT.

04:06:41.120 --> 04:06:45.724 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE PRODUCT AVAILABLE FOR

04:06:42.721 --> 04:06:47.259 region:rollup2
THE GIVEN PROCEDURE.

04:06:45.724 --> 04:06:48.360 region:rollup2
SPECIALTY PHARMACIES IT TREAT

04:06:47.259 --> 04:06:50.329 region:rollup2
BLEEDING DISORDER PATIENTS

04:06:48.360 --> 04:06:51.463 region:rollup2
PROVIDE TWENTY FOUR HOUR ACCESS

04:06:50.329 --> 04:06:53.699 region:rollup2
TO CONSULTATION WITH THE

04:06:51.463 --> 04:06:55.000 region:rollup2
CLINICAL PHARMACIST.

04:06:53.699 --> 04:06:56.835 region:rollup2
THIS ALLOWS PATIENTS TO HAVE A

04:06:55.000 --> 04:06:57.836 region:rollup2
SUPPLY OF FACTORY HOME SO THEY

04:06:56.835 --> 04:07:00.272 region:rollup2
CAN COMPLY WITH THEIR

04:06:57.836 --> 04:07:01.874 region:rollup2
PROPHYLAXIS AND TREAT A BLEEDER

04:07:00.272 --> 04:07:03.242 region:rollup2
EARLY SHOULD OCCUR.

04:07:01.874 --> 04:07:05.077 region:rollup2
THEREBY KEEPING THEM OUT OF THE

04:07:03.242 --> 04:07:06.879 region:rollup2
ER OR HOSPITAL AND PREVENTING

04:07:05.077 --> 04:07:09.315 region:rollup2
COSTLY COMPLICATIONS SUCH AS THE

04:07:06.879 --> 04:07:11.050 region:rollup2
JOINT REPLACEMENT.

04:07:09.315 --> 04:07:12.785 region:rollup2
THE D. H. CS PROPOSED

04:07:11.050 --> 04:07:13.952 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY FOR

04:07:12.785 --> 04:07:15.554 region:rollup2
BLOOD FACTORS FOR MEDI CAL

04:07:13.952 --> 04:07:17.189 region:rollup2
PATIENTS.

04:07:15.554 --> 04:07:18.824 region:rollup2
WOULD THREATEN BLEEDING DISORDER

04:07:17.189 --> 04:07:21.393 region:rollup2
PATIENT HEALTH AND SAFETY BY

04:07:18.824 --> 04:07:22.895 region:rollup2
LIMITING ACCESS TO CARE.

04:07:21.393 --> 04:07:24.763 region:rollup2
THE NEW REIMBURSEMENT WOULD MAKE

04:07:22.895 --> 04:07:26.665 region:rollup2
IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO REMAIN

04:07:24.763 --> 04:07:28.367 region:rollup2
IN BUSINESS AND WILL NOT BE VERY

04:07:26.665 --> 04:07:30.202 region:rollup2
ATTRACTIVE TO LARGER SPECIALTY

04:07:28.367 --> 04:07:32.137 region:rollup2
PHARMACIES EITHER.

04:07:30.202 --> 04:07:33.906 region:rollup2
IT DOES NOT COVER THE COST OF

04:07:32.137 --> 04:07:34.873 region:rollup2
KEEPING FACTOR IN STOCK

04:07:33.906 --> 04:07:37.276 region:rollup2
OR PROVIDING SERVICES FOR THE

04:07:34.873 --> 04:07:39.011 region:rollup2
PATIENTS.

04:07:37.276 --> 04:07:40.579 region:rollup2
THIS WILL RESULT IN DECREASED

04:07:39.011 --> 04:07:42.981 region:rollup2
PATIENT CHOICE OF PHARMACY AND

04:07:40.579 --> 04:07:44.083 region:rollup2

WITHOUT AVAILABLE CLOTTING

RESORT BACK TO TREATING ON

04:07:47.619 --> 04:07:51.957 region:rollup2
DEMAND. I'M GOING TO HE OURS FOR

04:07:49.555 --> 04:07:53.292 region:rollup2
THEIR INFUSIONS.

04:07:51.957 --> 04:07:55.027 region:rollup2
HE OURS ARE NOT ADEQUATELY

04:07:53.292 --> 04:07:56.595 region:rollup2
PREPARED TO HANDLE A PATIENT

04:07:55.027 --> 04:07:57.129 region:rollup2
WITH A BLEEDING DISORDER.

04:07:56.595 --> 04:07:59.031 region:rollup2
MOST DO NOT STOP CLOTTING

04:07:57.129 --> 04:08:00.499 region:rollup2
FACTOR.

04:07:59.031 --> 04:08:02.134 region:rollup2
AND THE STAFF IS NOT FAMILIAR

04:08:00.499 --> 04:08:04.169 region:rollup2
WITH THE DIFFERENT PRODUCTS AND

04:08:02.134 --> 04:08:06.138 region:rollup2
HOW TO APPROPRIATELY DOES THEM.

04:08:04.169 --> 04:08:07.539 region:rollup2
AS A RESULT OUR PHARMACY HAS

04:08:06.138 --> 04:08:09.108 region:rollup2
BEEN A RESOURCE FOR MOST OF THE

04:08:07.539 --> 04:08:11.777 region:rollup2
E. OURS IN THE FRESNO AREA FOR

04:08:09.108 --> 04:08:12.911 region:rollup2
THIS VERY REASON.

04:08:11.777 --> 04:08:14.513 region:rollup2
I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE

04:08:12.911 --> 04:08:16.482 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU

ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE.

04:08:16.482 --> 04:08:19.585 region:rollup2
I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOU TO

04:08:17.950 --> 04:08:20.753 region:rollup2
PREVENT D. H. CS FROM IMPOSING

04:08:19.585 --> 04:08:22.087 region:rollup2
THEIR.

04:08:20.753 --> 04:08:23.856 region:rollup2
OPPOSED BLOOD FACTOR

04:08:22.087 --> 04:08:25.691 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT CUTS TO SPECIALTY

04:08:23.856 --> 04:08:27.392 region:rollup2
PHARMACIES WHO SERVE HEMOPHILIA

04:08:25.691 --> 04:08:29.128 region:rollup2
PATIENTS.

04:08:27.392 --> 04:08:30.329 region:rollup2
THE GOOD DOCTOR HURST.

04:08:29.128 --> 04:08:34.199 region:rollup2
WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT

04:08:30.329 --> 04:08:35.968 region:rollup2
ON ISSUE EIGHTEEN.

04:08:34.199 --> 04:08:37.603 region:rollup2
DOCTOR ARAMBULA AND MEMBERS

04:08:35.968 --> 04:08:39.271 region:rollup2
TERRY COVER HILL AGAIN FOR THE

04:08:37.603 --> 04:08:40.572 region:rollup2
MONTHLY COUNCIL CALIFORNIA

04:08:39.271 --> 04:08:42.508 region:rollup2
REPRESENTING THE FOUR THOUSAND

04:08:40.572 --> 04:08:43.809 region:rollup2
PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA WITH

04:08:42.508 --> 04:08:46.345 region:rollup2
HEMOPHILIA AND RELATED BLEEDING

04:08:43.809 --> 04:08:47.780 region:rollup2
DISORDERS. WE HAD HISTORICALLY

04:08:46.345 --> 04:08:49.314 region:rollup2
SUPPORTED THE CURRENT RATE THAT

04:08:47.780 --> 04:08:50.883 region:rollup2
IS ON THE BOOKS AND I THINK

04:08:49.314 --> 04:08:52.217 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO THE FEDERAL

04:08:50.883 --> 04:08:54.153 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT CONTACTED THE STATE

04:08:52.217 --> 04:08:55.521 region:rollup2
INSTEAD. THEY NO LONGER WILL BE

04:08:54.153 --> 04:08:56.889 region:rollup2
ALLOWING THAT RATE AND SO THEY

04:08:55.521 --> 04:08:58.157 region:rollup2
DIRECTED THE DEPARTMENT OF

04:08:56.889 --> 04:09:00.159 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO COME UP

04:08:58.157 --> 04:09:02.060 region:rollup2
WITH A NEW RATE. THE COUNCIL

04:09:00.159 --> 04:09:03.762 region:rollup2
DOESN'T HAVE A SPECIFIC POSITION

04:09:02.060 --> 04:09:05.230 region:rollup2
ON WHAT THAT RATE SHOULD BE OR

04:09:03.762 --> 04:09:06.298 region:rollup2
LEAVING IT TO THE THREE FORTY BE

04:09:05.230 --> 04:09:08.500 region:rollup2
PHARMACIES IN THE SPECIALTY

04:09:06.298 --> 04:09:09.701 region:rollup2
PHARMACIES BEFORE YOU TO COME UP

04:09:08.500 --> 04:09:11.837 region:rollup2
WITH THAT SOLUTION. WITH THE

04:09:09.701 --> 04:09:13.605 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT WE ARE SIMPLY ASKING

04:09:11.837 --> 04:09:15.374 region:rollup2
FOR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND

04:09:13.605 --> 04:09:17.843 region:rollup2
FOR YOU TO BE AWARE THAT THE

04:09:15.374 --> 04:09:18.944 region:rollup2
RATE THAT WAS INITIALLY PROPOSED

04:09:17.843 --> 04:09:21.280 region:rollup2
WE'RE HEARING IS.

04:09:18.944 --> 04:09:23.549 region:rollup2
INADEQUATE THERE ARE A LOT OF

04:09:21.280 --> 04:09:25.517 region:rollup2
ANCILLARY SERVICES THAT GO INTO

04:09:23.549 --> 04:09:26.785 region:rollup2
THE DELIVERY AND DISPENSING OF

04:09:25.517 --> 04:09:28.587 region:rollup2
CLOTTING FACTOR TO THE PATIENTS

04:09:26.785 --> 04:09:30.189 region:rollup2
IN THE HOME SETTING. WE WORKED

04:09:28.587 --> 04:09:31.490 region:rollup2
WITH ON KILEY MITCHELL ON THE

04:09:30.189 --> 04:09:32.724 region:rollup2
STANDARDS BILL IT'S STILL ON THE

04:09:31.490 --> 04:09:34.526 region:rollup2
BOOKS THAT WAS PUT FORTH IN

04:09:32.724 --> 04:09:36.595 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWELVE. SO THERE ARE

04:09:34.526 --> 04:09:38.197 region:rollup2
STANDARDS AROUND THE DISPENSING

04:09:36.595 --> 04:09:39.865 region:rollup2
OF THE STORAGE OF FACTOR SO

04:09:38.197 --> 04:09:41.533 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALL GOOD THAT'S ALL STILL

04:09:39.865 --> 04:09:43.268 region:rollup2
ON THE BOOKS AS I MENTIONED BUT

04:09:41.533 --> 04:09:43.869 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS THE NEW RATE IT HAS TO

04:09:43.268 --> 04:09:46.205 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO COVER THE SHIPPING

04:09:43.869 --> 04:09:46.538 region:rollup2
SO.

04:09:46.205 --> 04:09:47.573 region:rollup2
IF THERE ARE.

04:09:46.538 --> 04:09:48.474 region:rollup2
.

04:09:47.573 --> 04:09:50.108 region:rollup2
THIS THE COSTS RELATED A

04:09:48.474 --> 04:09:52.044 region:rollup2
SHIPPING INCLUDE TRANSPORTATION

04:09:50.108 --> 04:09:53.545 region:rollup2
INCLUDE ICE PACKS IN THAT

04:09:52.044 --> 04:09:54.146 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE FACTOR SO THAT IT

04:09:53.545 --> 04:09:55.581 region:rollup2
DOESN'T.

04:09:54.146 --> 04:09:57.115 region:rollup2
GET DESTROYED OUT IN THE HEAT

04:09:55.581 --> 04:09:58.484 region:rollup2
IN FRONT OF SOMEONE'S DOORSTEP

04:09:57.115 --> 04:10:00.285 region:rollup2
SO THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS THAT

04:09:58.484 --> 04:10:01.453 region:rollup2
GO INTO THE ANCILLARY COSTS THAT

04:10:00.285 --> 04:10:03.088 region:rollup2
THE SPECIALTY PHARMACIES IN

04:10:01.453 --> 04:10:04.890 region:rollup2
THREE FOUR TO BE PHARMACIES. CAN

04:10:03.088 --> 04:10:07.459 region:rollup2
ARTICULATE BETTER THAN I CAN WE

04:10:04.890 --> 04:10:08.794 region:rollup2
JUST HOPE THAT. YOU KEEP AN EYE

04:10:07.459 --> 04:10:09.895 region:rollup2
ON WHAT IS GOING ON IN THAT THE

04:10:08.794 --> 04:10:11.563 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE AND THE DEPARTMENT

04:10:09.895 --> 04:10:15.067 region:rollup2
ARE ALL INVOLVED IN A SOLUTION

04:10:11.563 --> 04:10:16.702 region:rollup2
THANK YOU BECAME.

04:10:15.067 --> 04:10:18.136 region:rollup2
I'M JOHN MARTINEZ FROM FRESNO I

HEMOPHILIA.

04:10:20.739 --> 04:10:24.176 region:rollup2
AND WHEN MY SON WAS BORN THERE

04:10:22.674 --> 04:10:25.344 region:rollup2

DIDN'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION AND

04:10:32.851 --> 04:10:35.988 region:rollup2
MY SON WENT TO A GREAT DEAL OF

04:10:34.386 --> 04:10:36.788 region:rollup2
TRAUMA IN THE HOSPITAL. BECAUSE

04:10:35.988 --> 04:10:38.123 region:rollup2
THE DOCTORS DIDN'T KNOW WHAT

04:10:36.788 --> 04:10:39.024 region:rollup2
THEY WERE DOING AND THEY DIDN'T

04:10:38.123 --> 04:10:40.158 region:rollup2

04:10:46.231 --> 04:10:48.634 region:rollup2
THAT PROCESS THAT WE SORT OF

04:10:47.633 --> 04:10:50.102 region:rollup2
HAVE TO ADVOCATE FOR OURSELVES%

04:10:48.634 --> 04:10:51.203 region:rollup2
AND LEARN BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL WE

04:10:50.102 --> 04:10:52.437 region:rollup2
WERE ABLE TO GET CONNECTED WITH

HAND.

04:16:09.654 --> 04:16:12.724 region:rollup2
THEY TRIED ASPIRATED VINI

04:16:11.122 --> 04:16:14.025 region:rollup2
PUNCTURE OF FULL BOTTOM THE

04:16:12.724 --> 04:16:16.661 region:rollup2
SAMPLING CASE I MIGHT NEED A

04:16:14.025 --> 04:16:18.630 region:rollup2
TRANSFUSION IN THAT PROCESS THEY

04:16:16.661 --> 04:16:20.665 region:rollup2
INFILTRATED THE VEINS IN MY LEFT

04:16:18.630 --> 04:16:22.100 region:rollup2
ARM. THE ONE DOCTOR THAT KNEW

04:16:20.665 --> 04:16:24.135 region:rollup2
ANYTHING ABOUT HIM THE PHILLY AT

04:16:22.100 --> 04:16:26.571 region:rollup2
THE TIME WAS ON VACATION FOR THE

04:16:24.135 --> 04:16:28.173 region:rollup2
WEEKEND. BY THE TIME HE GOT BACK

04:16:26.571 --> 04:16:29.274 region:rollup2
FORTY EIGHT HOURS LATER IN THE

04:16:28.173 --> 04:16:30.976 region:rollup2
THERAPY I NEED WHICH WAS A

04:16:29.274 --> 04:16:32.043 region:rollup2
PRECURSOR TO THIS REMARKABLE

04:16:30.976 --> 04:16:34.145 region:rollup2
FACT REPLACING THE RECALL CRY

04:16:32.043 --> 04:16:36.047 region:rollup2
PRECIPITATE BUT IT WAS VERY

04:16:34.145 --> 04:16:37.949 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE. IN AND OF ITSELF.

04:16:36.047 --> 04:16:39.851 region:rollup2
BY THE TIME HE GOT BACK I HAD

04:16:37.949 --> 04:16:41.920 region:rollup2
HATE OPENS CONTRACTURE AYE IT

04:16:39.851 --> 04:16:44.055 region:rollup2
HAD A COMPARTMENT SYNDROME. AND

04:16:41.920 --> 04:16:44.556 region:rollup2
FOR THE LAST FIFTY YEARS I'VE

04:16:44.055 --> 04:16:46.758 region:rollup2
HAD ESSENTIALLY THIS ARM

04:16:44.556 --> 04:16:48.159 region:rollup2
HANGING.

04:16:46.758 --> 04:16:50.395 region:rollup2
THAT WAS BECAUSE OF THE LATE OF

04:16:48.159 --> 04:16:52.264 region:rollup2
ONE BELIEVE.

04:16:50.395 --> 04:16:54.366 region:rollup2
FROM CRIER PRECIPITATE WAS

04:16:52.264 --> 04:16:55.433 region:rollup2
LITERALLY TWO FLOORS ABOVE ME

04:16:54.366 --> 04:16:57.636 region:rollup2
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T GET INTO MY

BODY IN A TIMELY BASIS THAT IS

04:16:57.636 --> 04:17:01.039 region:rollup2
WHY IT'S SO CRITICAL. THAT

04:16:59.337 --> 04:17:04.643 region:rollup2
PATIENTS HAVE RENTAL ACCESS TO

04:17:01.039 --> 04:17:06.144 region:rollup2
CARE NO INTERRUPTIONS NO WAY TO

04:17:04.643 --> 04:17:07.946 region:rollup2
STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING HAVING

04:17:06.144 --> 04:17:10.015 region:rollup2
IT IN THEIR HOME BECAUSE IT IS

04:17:07.946 --> 04:17:11.483 region:rollup2
THE DELAY TO THAT FACTOR GETTING

04:17:10.015 --> 04:17:13.084 region:rollup2
INTO A PERSONAL BLEEDING

04:17:11.483 --> 04:17:14.653 region:rollup2
DISORDER.

04:17:13.084 --> 04:17:16.488 region:rollup2
AT ANY ANY DELAY WHATSOEVER

04:17:14.653 --> 04:17:18.290 region:rollup2
WHICH WILL CAUSE IRREPARABLE

04:17:16.488 --> 04:17:20.392 region:rollup2
PERMANENT DAMAGE THAT WILL.

04:17:18.290 --> 04:17:22.427 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY CHANGED THEIR LIVES

04:17:20.392 --> 04:17:24.462 region:rollup2
AND NOT FOR THE BETTER I URGE

04:17:22.427 --> 04:17:25.230 region:rollup2
YOU TO FIND A BETTER MECHANISM I

04:17:24.462 --> 04:17:26.865 region:rollup2

RULE.

04:17:29.934 --> 04:17:32.871 region:rollup2
BUT THERE ARE OTHER STATES WHO'S

MEDICAID PROGRAMS HAVE LOOKED AT

04:17:32.871 --> 04:17:35.941 region:rollup2
THIS ISSUE SPECIFICALLY FOR

WONDERING IF YOU CAN ADDRESS

04:28:26.357 --> 04:28:33.097 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE.

04:28:30.161 --> 04:28:34.699 region:rollup2

04:28:33.097 --> 04:28:36.100 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF THE PROPOSAL I I DO

04:28:34.699 --> 04:28:37.902 region:rollup2
WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S CLEAR TO

04:28:36.100 --> 04:28:40.338 region:rollup2
EVERYONE THAT THE A PROPOSED

04:28:37.902 --> 04:28:42.440 region:rollup2
CHANGE. I THAT THE DEPARTMENT

04:28:40.338 --> 04:28:43.741 region:rollup2
HAD PUT OUT AND DATING GAUGE

04:28:42.440 --> 04:28:45.910 region:rollup2
WHAT STAKEHOLDERS WAS AS A

04:28:43.741 --> 04:28:48.412 region:rollup2
RESULT OF AS WAS MENTIONED WHAT

04:28:45.910 --> 04:28:50.247 region:rollup2
THE FIRST ON PUBLIC COMMENT. AS

04:28:48.412 --> 04:28:51.649 region:rollup2
A RESULT OF A FEDERAL RULE THAT

04:28:50.247 --> 04:28:53.217 region:rollup2
CAME OUT WHERE WE HAVE TO MAKE

04:28:51.649 --> 04:28:54.652 region:rollup2
CHANGES IN OUR DRUG

04:28:53.217 --> 04:28:57.021 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT POLICIES

04:28:54.652 --> 04:28:58.489 region:rollup2
SO BLOOD CLOTTING FACTOR IS ONE.

04:28:57.021 --> 04:29:01.425 region:rollup2
WE DID PUT OUT JUST THAT A

04:28:58.489 --> 04:29:02.393 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL WE HAVE BEEN AYE TAKING

04:29:01.425 --> 04:29:04.261 region:rollup2
BACK.

04:29:02.393 --> 04:29:06.063 region:rollup2
THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN

04:29:04.261 --> 04:29:07.631 region:rollup2
RECEIVED TO DATE AND THAT'S WHY

04:29:06.063 --> 04:29:09.367 region:rollup2
FOLKS HAVE NOT YET HEARD BACK

04:29:07.631 --> 04:29:11.068 region:rollup2
FROM US IS BECAUSE WE'RE TAKING

04:29:09.367 --> 04:29:12.370 region:rollup2
THOSE UNDER CONSIDERATION. AND

04:29:11.068 --> 04:29:13.571 region:rollup2
TRYING TO WORK THROUGH THE

04:29:12.370 --> 04:29:15.506 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WERE

04:29:13.571 --> 04:29:17.108 region:rollup2
PROVIDED TO US SO I JUST WANT TO

04:29:15.506 --> 04:29:18.376 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WERE AWARE

04:29:17.108 --> 04:29:20.711 region:rollup2
THAT.

04:29:18.376 --> 04:29:22.580 region:rollup2
THE PROPOSAL WAS SOMETHING THAT

04:29:20.711 --> 04:29:24.715 region:rollup2
WE WANTED TO HAVE ENGAGEMENT

04:29:22.580 --> 04:29:25.783 region:rollup2
WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON AND IS NOT

04:29:24.715 --> 04:29:27.218 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE COME OUT

04:29:25.783 --> 04:29:28.919 region:rollup2
AND SAID YES THIS IS IN FACT

04:29:27.218 --> 04:29:30.154 region:rollup2
WHAT WE ARE DOING. WE ARE

04:29:28.919 --> 04:29:32.390 region:rollup2
REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL

04:29:30.154 --> 04:29:34.358 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT TO COME UP WITH A

04:29:32.390 --> 04:29:35.926 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY AND

04:29:34.358 --> 04:29:38.729 region:rollup2
BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

04:29:35.926 --> 04:29:41.032 region:rollup2
DOING. IS TECH BREAKING APART

04:29:38.729 --> 04:29:44.735 region:rollup2
ARM THAT REIMBURSEMENT UP THE

04:29:41.032 --> 04:29:46.904 region:rollup2
DRUG ITSELF AND THEN ALSO DOING.

04:29:44.735 --> 04:29:48.973 region:rollup2
A BETTER JOB OF DELINEATING

04:29:46.904 --> 04:29:50.241 region:rollup2
WHAT THOSE CANCEL LARRY SERVICES

04:29:48.973 --> 04:29:52.009 region:rollup2
ARE BECAUSE TODAY THE WAY THAT

04:29:50.241 --> 04:29:54.278 region:rollup2
THEY'RE REIMBURSED. IS BASED

04:29:52.009 --> 04:29:56.614 region:rollup2
UPON AVERAGE SALES PRICE OF THE

04:29:54.278 --> 04:29:58.115 region:rollup2
DRUG PLUS TWENTY PERCENT.

04:29:56.614 --> 04:29:59.283 region:rollup2
SO IT'S TWENTY PERCENT OF THAT

04:29:58.115 --> 04:30:01.018 region:rollup2
DRUG PRICE AND SO WHAT SEE A

04:29:59.283 --> 04:30:02.953 region:rollup2
MASSIVE SAYING. THEY BELIEVE

04:30:01.018 --> 04:30:05.256 region:rollup2
THAT THEY ARE OVERPAYING FOR

04:30:02.953 --> 04:30:06.590 region:rollup2
CLOTTING FACTOR WE HAVE TO DO IS

04:30:05.256 --> 04:30:08.859 region:rollup2
COME UP WITH THE METHODOLOGY

04:30:06.590 --> 04:30:10.261 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE NOT DICTATED WHAT THAT

04:30:08.859 --> 04:30:12.196 region:rollup2
METHODOLOGY SHOULD LOOK LIKE.

04:30:10.261 --> 04:30:14.198 region:rollup2
BUT IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING THAT

04:30:12.196 --> 04:30:15.099 region:rollup2
MEETS THEIR REQUIREMENTS AND

04:30:14.198 --> 04:30:17.268 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE TO PUT IN FRONT OF

04:30:15.099 --> 04:30:19.070 region:rollup2
THEM WE DON'T HAVE A TIMELINE

04:30:17.268 --> 04:30:21.272 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WHEN THEY DID APPROVE

04:30:19.070 --> 04:30:23.407 region:rollup2
OUR STATE PLAN AMENDMENT. FOR

04:30:21.272 --> 04:30:25.109 region:rollup2
OUTPATIENT COVER DRUGS BY A

04:30:23.407 --> 04:30:26.911 region:rollup2
PHARMACY PROVIDERS.

04:30:25.109 --> 04:30:28.679 region:rollup2
THEY DID INDICATE IN THAT LETTER

04:30:26.911 --> 04:30:30.014 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WERE EXPECTING TO SEE

04:30:28.679 --> 04:30:32.183 region:rollup2
SOMETHING FROM US IN THE THIRD

04:30:30.014 --> 04:30:33.951 region:rollup2
QUARTER. OF THIS YEAR BUT WE

04:30:32.183 --> 04:30:35.419 region:rollup2
HAVE ALREADY INDICATED TO THEM

04:30:33.951 --> 04:30:37.521 region:rollup2
WE WILL NOT HAVE SOMETHING TO

04:30:35.419 --> 04:30:38.989 region:rollup2
PUT BEFORE THEM AND THAT WE ARE

04:30:37.521 --> 04:30:40.458 region:rollup2
JUST WORK PART TO THEM REPORT

04:30:38.989 --> 04:30:42.359 region:rollup2
BACK TO THEM IN TERMS OF THE

04:30:40.458 --> 04:30:44.261 region:rollup2
STATUS. OF WHERE WE'RE AT AND

04:30:42.359 --> 04:30:46.263 region:rollup2
