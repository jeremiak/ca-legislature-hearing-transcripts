00:12:54.373 --> 00:12:55.274
PERCENTAGE POINT IN A GIVEN

00:12:55.341 --> 00:12:56.675
YEAR. THERE'S COGNITIVE

00:12:56.742 --> 00:12:58.377
PERFORMANCE THAN IN LOS ANGELES

00:12:58.444 --> 00:12:59.979
WHEN SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLAR AIR

00:13:00.045 --> 00:13:01.013
PURIFIERS WERE INSTALLED IN

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.748
SCHOOLS IN RESPONSE TO A LOCAL

00:13:02.815 --> 00:13:04.517
CATHOLIC. STUDENT PERFORMANCE

00:13:04.583 --> 00:13:05.885
IMPROVED AS MUCH AS IT WOULD IF

00:13:05.951 --> 00:13:07.419
THE CLASS SIZES WERE REDUCED BY

00:13:07.486 --> 00:13:09.655
A THIRD. PARTY SEES MORE COME

00:13:09.722 --> 00:13:11.123
INCLUDED THERE I JUST CAN'T

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:12.625
SERVE THE COUNTLESS VARIETIES

00:13:12.691 --> 00:13:14.193
ACUTE AND CHRONIC RESPIRATORY

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.694
DISEASES LIKE ASTHMA AND

00:13:15.761 --> 00:13:17.830
STROKES. VOLATILITY TO CODE

00:13:17.897 --> 00:13:19.398
GROWS THE INCIDENCE OF

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:21.267
ALZHEIMER'S CAN TRIPLE DEMENTIA

00:13:21.333 --> 00:13:25.037
RATES. GROW TOO AS TO THOSE OF

00:13:25.104 --> 00:13:26.038
PARKINSON'S. I SAID EARLIER. IN

00:13:26.105 --> 00:13:26.939
FROM WILDFIRE SMOKE ARE

00:13:27.006 --> 00:13:28.507
RELATIVELY SPEAKING NON

00:13:28.574 --> 00:13:30.109
DISCRIMINATORY. THAT'S OF

00:13:30.176 --> 00:13:31.810
COURSE AN OVERSIMPLIFICATION

00:13:31.877 --> 00:13:33.412
SINCE THE WEALTHY AND WELL

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:34.213
CONNECTED CAN AFFORD TO GET

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.015
AWAY. DOWN FOR THEIR HOMES OR

00:13:36.081 --> 00:13:37.783
THEIR PURE FIRES TO LIVE

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:39.018
FARTHER FROM THE WILDLAND URBAN

00:13:39.084 --> 00:13:39.952
INTERFACE FOR THE FIRES

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:41.921
THEMSELVES ARE LIKELY TO BE.

00:13:41.987 --> 00:13:43.122
BUT IT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT AN

00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:44.356
OVERSIMPLIFICATION OF CIVIC

00:13:44.423 --> 00:13:46.325
CLIMATE CHANGE AS A WHOLE. IS

00:13:46.392 --> 00:13:47.893
POWERFULLY DISCRIMINATORY IN

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.128
FACTTHIS IS TRUE AT EVERY

00:13:49.195 --> 00:13:50.896
LEVEL OF ANALYSIS. THE POOR

00:13:50.963 --> 00:13:52.164
COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD ARE

00:13:52.231 --> 00:13:53.032
THOSE WILL FACE THE MOST

00:13:53.098 --> 00:13:55.000
INTENSE IMPACTS. WITHIN NATIONS

00:13:55.067 --> 00:13:56.635
IT'S THE POOR REGIONS WITHIN

00:13:56.702 --> 00:13:57.770
STATES AND CITIES THIS THE

00:13:57.836 --> 00:13:59.038
NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES.

00:13:59.104 --> 00:14:00.372
WITH THE LEAST RESOURCES FROM

00:14:00.439 --> 00:14:01.440
THE FURTHEST FROM POLITICAL

00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:05.744
POWER. WERE SUBJECTED. TO THE

00:14:05.811 --> 00:14:06.378
GROSSEST CLIMATE INJUSTICE. THE

00:14:06.445 --> 00:14:07.813
WILDFIRE FACED BY LATINOS IN

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:08.948
THE UNITED STATES IS MORE THAN

00:14:09.014 --> 00:14:10.082
TWICE THE SIZE THE POPULATION

00:14:10.149 --> 00:14:11.617
AS A WHOLE WITH MORE THAN ONE

00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:13.385
THIRD LIVING AREAS DEFINED AS

00:14:13.452 --> 00:14:15.788
EXTREME WILDFIRE RISKS. IN

00:14:15.854 --> 00:14:18.224
CALIFORNIA MORE THAN 60% OF ALL

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:19.225
NEW RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS

00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:20.659
SINCE NINETEEN NINETY HAS BEEN

00:14:20.726 --> 00:14:22.261
IN WILDFIRE PRONE AREAS WHICH-

00:14:22.328 --> 00:14:23.128
TAKEN WITH THE EARLIER

00:14:23.195 --> 00:14:24.496
STATISTICS SUGGEST THAT THE

00:14:24.563 --> 00:14:25.698
STATE NEEDS A MUCH MORE

00:14:25.764 --> 00:14:27.499
EXPENSIVE HOUSING POLICY. AND

00:14:27.566 --> 00:14:29.235
THEN IT MUST ALSO BE MORE

00:14:29.301 --> 00:14:31.637
INCLUSIVE. SEA LEVEL RISE AND

00:14:31.704 --> 00:14:33.038
COASTAL EROSION IS LESS TALKED

00:14:33.105 --> 00:14:34.073
ABOUT THREAT IN THE STATE BUT

00:14:34.139 --> 00:14:35.941
THOSE RISKS ARE PROFOUND. WE'RE

00:14:36.008 --> 00:14:37.076
ALREADY BEGINNING TO SEE IN

00:14:37.142 --> 00:14:39.211
CALIFORNIA WHAT IT MEANS. IN

00:14:39.278 --> 00:14:40.546
THE CASE OF MANAGED RETREAT

00:14:40.613 --> 00:14:41.313
LIKE THAT UNDERTAKEN IN

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.616
PACIFICA. BY TWENTY FIFTY WHAT

00:14:43.682 --> 00:14:44.550
USED TO BE A HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD

00:14:44.617 --> 00:14:46.318
WILL BE HITTING SAN DIEGO EVERY

00:14:46.385 --> 00:14:48.153
SINGLE YEAR. THE IMPACT OF

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.455
INTENSIFYING HEATWAVES WILL BE

00:14:49.521 --> 00:14:50.556
FELT MOST INTENSELY BY THE

00:14:50.623 --> 00:14:51.890
STATES DISENFRANCHISED

00:14:51.957 --> 00:14:54.460
AGRICULTURAL WORKERS. BY TWENTY

00:14:54.526 --> 00:14:56.028
FIFTY AS MANY AS TEN THOUSAND

00:14:56.095 --> 00:14:57.930
CALIFORNIANS WILL LIKELY DIED

00:14:57.997 --> 00:14:59.698
HE DISSECTS EVERY SINGLE YEAR.

00:14:59.765 --> 00:15:00.666
ALREADY COMMUNITIES IN THE

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:01.800
CENTRAL VALLEY FROM EARLY MARCH

00:15:01.867 --> 00:15:03.435
A DENTIST AND HAD HAD TO GO

00:15:03.502 --> 00:15:04.770
WITHOUT SAFETY DRINKING WATER

00:15:04.837 --> 00:15:06.005
DURING OUR I'M GOING TO START

00:15:06.071 --> 00:15:07.673
DROUGHT. THIS IS WHY KAMEL

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.008
HARRISON SAID RIGHTLY THAT THE

00:15:09.074 --> 00:15:11.110
STATE WATER CRISIS IT'S A

00:15:11.176 --> 00:15:12.478
MATTER OF RACIAL INJUSTICE IT

00:15:12.544 --> 00:15:14.346
IS THIS YEAR THEY'RE ALREADY

00:15:14.413 --> 00:15:15.914
BEEN TWO HUNDRED SIXTY NINE

00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:16.582
CASES OF WATER SHORTAGE IN THE

00:15:16.649 --> 00:15:18.350
STATE. BY YEAR'S END THAT

00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:19.985
NUMBER COULD GROW TEN FOLD

00:15:20.052 --> 00:15:21.253
WHICH ISN'T EVEN TO MENTION AT

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:24.456
THE FUTURE OF GROWING DROUGHT

00:15:24.523 --> 00:15:25.324
AND AGING INFRASTRUCTURE. THE

00:15:25.391 --> 00:15:26.392
CLIMATE CHANGE ISN'T JUST

00:15:26.458 --> 00:15:27.493
PUNISHMENT. IT'S ALSO

00:15:27.559 --> 00:15:31.196
OPPORTUNITY. IF WE MUST ADAPT

00:15:31.263 --> 00:15:32.731
LET'S DO IT IN WAYS THAT ALLOW

00:15:32.798 --> 00:15:34.500
US TO BUILD A BETTER WORLD NOT

00:15:34.566 --> 00:15:36.068
JUST A MORE PROTECTED ONE A

00:15:36.135 --> 00:15:37.836
MORE EQUAL WORLD NOT JUST A

00:15:37.903 --> 00:15:39.938
LESS ANXIOUS ONE AND MORE JUST

00:15:40.005 --> 00:15:42.875
WORLD NOT JUST A MORE INDOOR

00:15:42.941 --> 00:15:45.444
AND ONE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU

00:15:45.511 --> 00:15:48.781
MR WELLS WELLS. NEXT WE'LL HEAR

00:15:48.847 --> 00:15:50.215
FROM A PANEL OF EXPERTS ON THE

00:15:50.282 --> 00:15:51.984
SUBJECT OF CLIMATE DISASTER

00:15:52.051 --> 00:15:56.088
RISKS AND INEQUITY. FIRST UP IS

00:15:56.155 --> 00:15:57.656
DO WE ORGANIZE WE'RE GONNA STAY

00:15:57.723 --> 00:15:58.857
WITH QUESTIONS WITH FIRST

00:15:58.924 --> 00:15:59.391
PRESENTER DO WE HAVE ANY

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:01.327
QUESTIONS FROM OUR- I GUESS YOU

00:16:01.393 --> 00:16:06.198
WELCOME TO. IN IN- MR WELLS

00:16:06.265 --> 00:16:07.032
WELLS I GUESS I WOULD I WOULD

00:16:07.099 --> 00:16:08.901
JUST I WOULD THANK YOU FOR

00:16:08.967 --> 00:16:10.202
TESTIFYING BEFORE US TODAY WE

00:16:10.269 --> 00:16:11.470
KNOW YOU JUST TESTIFIED BEFORE

00:16:11.537 --> 00:16:12.971
US SENATE COMMITTEE I BELIEVE

00:16:13.038 --> 00:16:15.908
IT WAS LAST WEEK- WE'RE HOPING

00:16:15.974 --> 00:16:18.110
THAT THE WAKE UP CALL OCCURS-

00:16:18.177 --> 00:16:21.380
BACK IN WASHINGTON AS WELL- BUT

00:16:21.447 --> 00:16:22.981
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE IS

00:16:23.048 --> 00:16:28.754
CALIFORNIA PROPERLY PREPARED.

00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:31.890
THE SHORT ANSWER IS NO- THERE

00:16:31.957 --> 00:16:32.958
ISN'T REALLY ANYWHERE IN THE US

00:16:33.025 --> 00:16:34.326
AND REALLY KNOW WHERE IN THE

00:16:34.393 --> 00:16:36.829
pPREPARED AT THE MOMENT FOR THE

00:16:36.895 --> 00:16:38.464
PROBLEMS THAT ARE COMING OUR

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:41.200
WAY BUT CALIFORNIA IS YOU KNOW

00:16:41.266 --> 00:16:43.569
IF AUSTRALIA IS THE UNUSUAL

00:16:43.635 --> 00:16:45.104
CASE IN A GLOBAL CONTEXT FOR

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:46.872
BEING A WEALTHY COUNTRY THAT IS

00:16:46.939 --> 00:16:48.741
ALREADY REALLY BUCKLED UNDER BY

00:16:48.807 --> 00:16:50.109
CARBON TAX AND EXPECTING MUCH

00:16:50.175 --> 00:16:52.277
MORE INTENSE ONES CALIFORNIA IS

00:16:52.344 --> 00:16:54.246
SORT OF A SIMILAR- EXAMPLE

00:16:54.313 --> 00:16:55.247
WITHIN THE UNITED STATES WHICH

00:16:55.314 --> 00:16:56.815
IS TO SAY IT IS A STATE WITH

00:16:56.882 --> 00:16:58.584
ENORMOUS RESOURCES. ENORMOUS

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:00.919
POLITICAL CAPACITY WHICH IS-

00:17:00.986 --> 00:17:03.822
FACING SOME INCREDIBLY INTENSE-

00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:05.557
YOU KNOW ON RUSSIAN CLIMATE

00:17:05.624 --> 00:17:07.426
STRESS I FOCUSE ON AIR

00:17:07.493 --> 00:17:08.694
POLLUTION THAT IS THE ONE THAT

00:17:08.761 --> 00:17:09.528
STRIKES ME IS THE MOST

00:17:09.595 --> 00:17:13.031
PRESSING- THE HEALTH TOLLS AND

00:17:13.098 --> 00:17:14.400
MENTAL HEALTH GOALS ARE QUITE

00:17:14.466 --> 00:17:16.835
DRAMATIC IN ADDITION TO ALL THE

00:17:16.902 --> 00:17:18.036
RISKS THAT WE ALREADY KNOW FROM

00:17:18.103 --> 00:17:19.938
THE FIRES THEMSELVES AND I

00:17:20.005 --> 00:17:20.472
THINK THAT THE STATE AS A

00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:22.941
WHOLE. BEGINNING TO WAKE UP TO

00:17:23.008 --> 00:17:24.309
THOSE THREATS BUT WE HAVEN'T

00:17:24.376 --> 00:17:25.377
YET REALLY STARTED TO THINK

00:17:25.444 --> 00:17:26.979
THROUGH HOW WE SHOULD RESPOND

00:17:27.045 --> 00:17:28.514
THEM BOTH ON THE FOREST

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.182
MANAGEMENT AND ELECTRIC GRADE

00:17:30.249 --> 00:17:32.885
SIDE BUT ALSO ON YOU KNOW

00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:35.654
EFFORTS TO CLEAN UP OUR AIR-

00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:37.423
PROTECT COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T

00:17:37.489 --> 00:17:38.991
HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BUY

00:17:39.057 --> 00:17:39.625
EXPENSIVE AIR FILTERS AND THAT

00:17:39.691 --> 00:17:41.360
SORT OF THING WE CAN'T BE

00:17:41.427 --> 00:17:43.162
IMPOSING THOSE KINDS OF. HEALTH

00:17:43.228 --> 00:17:45.597
IMPACTS ON THE DISADVANTAGED

00:17:45.664 --> 00:17:51.303
AND AS WE HEAD FORWARD INTO. A

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:51.870
WORLD THAT WILL BE MUCH LESS

00:17:51.937 --> 00:17:52.905
FORGIVING. AND I GIVE MY ONE

00:17:52.971 --> 00:17:53.839
FOLLOW UP FOR HIM TO THE NEXT

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:56.775
PANEL AS JUST BE. IT IN A IN A

00:17:56.842 --> 00:17:57.409
BUSINESS IS YOU SCENARIO IF WE

00:17:57.476 --> 00:17:59.077
CAN. INVESTING AT THE PACE WE

00:17:59.144 --> 00:18:00.412
AREN'T RESILIENCE. AND

00:18:00.479 --> 00:18:01.413
APPROACHING THE CHALLENGE THE

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.682
WAY WE ARE- BEYOND JUST THE

00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:05.317
HEAT SCENARIOS I KNOW YOU

00:18:05.384 --> 00:18:07.085
WOULD. PUT OUT A STATISTIC OF.

00:18:07.152 --> 00:18:08.921
POTENTIALLY TEN THOUSAND HEAT

00:18:08.987 --> 00:18:11.256
RELATED DEATHS. OF AGRICULTURAL

00:18:11.323 --> 00:18:14.393
WORKERS HI IN THE NEXTDECADE-

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.962
BUT OVERALL- DOES IT WHAT IS

00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:18.263
THIS ACTUALLY START TO LOOK

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:19.431
LIKE FOR CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE

00:18:19.498 --> 00:18:21.500
IS THIS. MASS MIGRATIONS ARE WE

00:18:21.567 --> 00:18:23.202
GONNA HAVE. YOU'VE TALKED A LOT

00:18:23.268 --> 00:18:24.970
ABOUT GLOBAL REFUGEE CRISIS

00:18:25.037 --> 00:18:27.272
OCCURRING COULD WE SEE THE SAME

00:18:27.339 --> 00:18:28.907
KIND OF SCENARIO IN CALIFORNIA.

00:18:28.974 --> 00:18:30.309
IN FACT INTERNAL MIGRATION IS

00:18:30.375 --> 00:18:31.910
MUCH MORE COMMON IN RESPONSE TO

00:18:31.977 --> 00:18:34.012
CLIMATE THREATS AND- CROSS

00:18:34.079 --> 00:18:35.948
BORDER MIGRATIONS BUT WHAT I

00:18:36.014 --> 00:18:37.716
WORRY ABOUT MORE THAN THE-

00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:41.019
THOSE SOURCES- YEAH. TRUNCHEONS

00:18:41.086 --> 00:18:43.088
IS THAT WE SORT OF LEARNED TO

00:18:43.155 --> 00:18:44.556
LIVE WITH A WORLD THAT IS

00:18:44.623 --> 00:18:46.658
DEFINED BY MUCH MORE SUFFERING-

00:18:46.725 --> 00:18:47.926
JUST TO CORRECT YOUR SORRY I

00:18:47.993 --> 00:18:48.961
DIDN'T. MEAN TO HIM DOESN'T

00:18:49.027 --> 00:18:50.062
HAVE A CULTURAL WORKERS EVERY

00:18:50.128 --> 00:18:51.497
YEAR IS JUST TEN THOUSAND

00:18:51.563 --> 00:18:52.865
CALIFORNIANS BUT THE MAJORITY

00:18:52.931 --> 00:18:54.066
OF THOSE ARE YOU KNOW THE LINE

00:18:54.132 --> 00:18:55.701
SURE THOSE WILL BE. THOSE WHO

00:18:55.767 --> 00:18:56.635
AFTER WORK OUTSIDE AND HE

00:18:56.702 --> 00:18:58.303
WITHOUT PROTECTION WHICH IS ONE

00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:59.204
REASON WHY I THINK IT'S-

00:18:59.271 --> 00:19:00.939
CRITICAL THAT. WE YOU KNOW WE

00:19:01.006 --> 00:19:02.274
TRY TO LEGISLATE MORE PROJECT

00:19:02.341 --> 00:19:04.042
PROTECTION FOR THOSE WORKERS. I

00:19:04.109 --> 00:19:05.978
THINK THAT THE SCARIEST FUTURE.

00:19:06.044 --> 00:19:09.014
IS NOT ONE IN WHICH- WE ABANDON

00:19:09.081 --> 00:19:10.516
THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND STOP

00:19:10.582 --> 00:19:12.150
FARMING IT IT'S ONE IN WHICH WE

00:19:12.217 --> 00:19:13.085
CONTINUE TO LIVE. IN THAT

00:19:13.151 --> 00:19:14.520
COMMUNITY CONTINUE TO FARM AND

00:19:14.586 --> 00:19:16.221
COMMUNITIES AND WHICH WE JUST

00:19:16.288 --> 00:19:18.323
BECOME OKAY. WITH MANY OF THOSE

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:19.424
WORKERS DYING EVERY SINGLE YEAR

00:19:19.491 --> 00:19:21.159
FROM YOUR RELATED DEATHS. I

00:19:21.226 --> 00:19:22.761
THINK THE SAME WARRIOR TIES TO

00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:24.329
MANY OF THE OTHER. KIND OF

00:19:24.396 --> 00:19:27.032
RISKS THAT WE HAVE- WE HAVE THE

00:19:27.099 --> 00:19:28.667
CAPACITY TO ADAPT. AND IN

00:19:28.734 --> 00:19:29.768
ADOPTING YOU CAN DESIGN A

00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:30.802
BETTER AND MORE EQUITABLE

00:19:30.869 --> 00:19:32.204
FUTURE BUT THERE'S ALSO THE

00:19:32.271 --> 00:19:33.372
RISK THAT WE SIMPLY SIMPLY

00:19:33.438 --> 00:19:35.407
NORMALIZED. A GROWING SCALE OF

00:19:35.474 --> 00:19:37.075
THREAT. EXCEPT MUCH MORE HUMOR

00:19:37.142 --> 00:19:38.677
AND HUMOR HUMAN SUFFERING AND

00:19:38.744 --> 00:19:40.679
THE HUMAN DYING. AND MOVE

00:19:40.746 --> 00:19:42.881
FORWARD AS THOUGH. OUTCOMES AND

00:19:42.948 --> 00:19:44.249
KIND OF FEATURES THAT A DECADE

00:19:44.316 --> 00:19:45.150
OR TWO AGO WE WOULD HAVE

00:19:45.217 --> 00:19:46.919
THOUGHT WERE UNTHINKABLE. I'M

00:19:46.985 --> 00:19:48.453
SIMPLY BECOME YOU KNOW THE

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.988
WHOLE PICTURE OF OUR LIVES. WE

00:19:50.055 --> 00:19:51.590
CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN AND

00:19:51.657 --> 00:19:58.230
THAT'S ONE REASON. WHY WE NEED

00:19:58.297 --> 00:19:58.997
TO ACT PREEMPTIVELY. TO MAKE

00:19:59.064 --> 00:20:00.132
AND THAT. HE'D BEEN IN THE

00:20:00.198 --> 00:20:01.466
EVENT OF TRULY GRUESOME CRIMES.

00:20:01.533 --> 00:20:03.201
A IMPACT ON HIM LIFE. IS NOT

00:20:03.268 --> 00:20:05.671
NEARLY SO GREAT. WHAT THANK YOU

SUFFERING IN THE DISCRIMINATORY

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.715
IMPACT IT'S GOING TO HAVE IS

00:20:16.782 --> 00:20:17.883
GOING TO BE A CENTRAL FOCUS FOR

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:19.318

TANK BASED IN LOS ANGELES AND-

00:21:15.641 --> 00:21:18.343
SENATOR STERN MENTIONED. WE

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:20.412
RECENTLY PURCHASED ARE. WE

00:21:20.479 --> 00:21:23.715
RECENTLY. PUT OUT A REPORT

TEST ON AVAILABLE VALUE WAITING

00:21:27.185 --> 00:21:29.788
CALIFORNIA'S PROJECTED. CLIMATE

00:21:29.855 --> 00:21:32.557
RESILIENCE FUNDING ANALYSIS

00:21:32.624 --> 00:21:34.426
FOUND THAT MILLIONS OF THE MOST

00:21:34.493 --> 00:21:37.229
VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS WILL BE

00:21:37.295 --> 00:21:39.931
LEFT BEHIND UNDER THE PLAN THE

00:21:39.998 --> 00:21:43.135
LEGISLATURE WAS CURRENTLY

00:21:43.201 --> 00:21:44.770
PURSUING- SO LET'S START WITH

00:21:44.836 --> 00:21:48.507
THE GENDER IMPACTS OF THAT. I

00:21:48.573 --> 00:21:50.275
AM WITH ITS FOCUS ON

00:21:50.342 --> 00:21:52.911
TRADITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE ON

00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:55.180
AND A LACK OF FUNDING FOR MORE

00:21:55.247 --> 00:21:57.883
GENDER BALANCED- SHIELD SUCH

00:21:57.949 --> 00:22:00.419
JUST PUBLIC HEALTH. WE FOUND

00:22:00.485 --> 00:22:03.789
THAT 92% OF THE JOBS LIKELY TO

00:22:03.855 --> 00:22:07.759
BE CREATED HI. THE COMPLIMENT

00:22:07.826 --> 00:22:08.927
RESILIENCE BONDS WOULD GET A

00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:12.030
DEMAND WHILE ONLY 8% OF THE

00:22:12.097 --> 00:22:15.400
JOBS WERE PROJECTED TO GO TO

00:22:15.467 --> 00:22:16.802
WOMEN. ON THIS WASN'T THE ONLY

00:22:16.868 --> 00:22:20.338
STRIKING GENDER INEQUITY IN-

00:22:20.405 --> 00:22:23.008
THE PROPOSED FUNDING. THE TWO

00:22:23.075 --> 00:22:25.110
REGIONS THAT GET THE MOST PER

00:22:25.177 --> 00:22:27.713
CAPITA FUNDING- THE NORTH COAST

00:22:27.779 --> 00:22:29.414
REGIONS IN THE SIERRA NEVADA

00:22:29.481 --> 00:22:31.783
REGENTS ARE MAJORITY MAN THE

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:34.119
TWO REGIONS THAT GET THE LEAST

00:22:34.186 --> 00:22:37.055
FUNDING ARE MAJORITY WOMEN ON

00:22:37.122 --> 00:22:38.623
THESE GENDER DIFFERENCES ARE

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:41.126
STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. IN

00:22:41.193 --> 00:22:42.661
TERMS OF GREETING THIS MAP

00:22:42.728 --> 00:22:45.464
WHICH WILL FOLLOW ON THAT SIDE-

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:47.032
ON THE NEXT SIDE AS WELL THE

00:22:47.099 --> 00:22:48.633
BLACK DOTS ARE POPULATION

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:51.036
DENSITY ET DARK GREEN IT'S THE

00:22:51.103 --> 00:22:53.605
MOST FUNDING- PER CAPITA IN

00:22:53.672 --> 00:22:55.173
CLIMATE AND- RESILIENCE

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.410
INVESTMENTS AND YELLOW IS THE

00:22:58.477 --> 00:23:01.880
LEAST. SO THIS GETS TO THE

00:23:01.947 --> 00:23:03.648
HEART OF OUR ANALYSIS THE

00:23:03.715 --> 00:23:05.784
PROJECTION OF THE IN THE BEST

00:23:05.851 --> 00:23:09.888
HANDS BY REGIONS AS- AS

00:23:09.955 --> 00:23:11.757
REFLECTED IN THE TWO CLIMATE

00:23:11.823 --> 00:23:15.127
RESILIENCE FARMS- EIGHTY

00:23:15.193 --> 00:23:16.595
FIFTEEN HUNDRED IN SP FORTY

00:23:16.661 --> 00:23:17.929
FIVE ARE NOW LISTS THE SPECIFIC

00:23:17.996 --> 00:23:19.865
ANALYSIS. THE NUMBERS HERE ARE

00:23:19.931 --> 00:23:22.334
CRAZY FIFTEEN HUNDRED- BUT THE

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:26.371
TWO- BARNES HAD SIMILAR RESULTS.

00:23:26.438 --> 00:23:28.273
LET ME TALK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.175
OUR METHODS BASICALLY OUR DATA

00:23:30.242 --> 00:23:32.277
SCIENTISTS CREATED MERGED AND

00:23:32.344 --> 00:23:34.112
AGGREGATED INFORMATION FROM

00:23:34.179 --> 00:23:36.481
MULTIPLE SOURCES TO PRODUCE

00:23:36.548 --> 00:23:38.917
DETAILED DEMOGRAPHIC STATISTICS

00:23:38.984 --> 00:23:40.485
FOR EACH OF THE NINE REGIONS

00:23:40.552 --> 00:23:42.821
IDENTIFIED IN CALIFORNIA'S FOR

00:23:42.888 --> 00:23:45.390
CLIMATE CHANGE ASSESSMENT- AT

00:23:45.457 --> 00:23:47.392
THE SAME TIME WE ANALYZED THE

00:23:47.459 --> 00:23:50.362
PROJECTS AND FUNDING- IN THE

00:23:50.428 --> 00:23:53.765
SEVERAL DOZEN- PROJECTS ARE.

00:23:53.832 --> 00:23:56.101
LISTED IN THE TWO BARNS ON AND

00:23:56.168 --> 00:23:57.702
WE BROUGHT THESE TWO DATASETS

00:23:57.769 --> 00:24:00.372
TOGETHER TO DETERMINE WHAT-

00:24:00.438 --> 00:24:02.340
MARIUS WAYS OF LOOKING AT THE

00:24:02.407 --> 00:24:05.844
FUNDING- FOR THE REGIONS- AS

00:24:05.911 --> 00:24:07.279
YOU CAN SEE THE NORTH COAST

00:24:07.345 --> 00:24:11.516
REGION- IS PROJECTED TO RECEIVE

00:24:11.583 --> 00:24:12.150
ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY

00:24:12.217 --> 00:24:13.418
FOUR DOLLARS. IN FUNDING PER

00:24:13.485 --> 00:24:16.021
CAPITA VERSUS THE LOS ANGELES

00:24:16.087 --> 00:24:17.823
REGION WHERE 45% OF STATE

00:24:17.889 --> 00:24:20.091
LIVES- IT'S PROJECTED TO

00:24:20.158 --> 00:24:21.493
RECEIVE ONLY EIGHTY FOUR

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.929
DOLLARS PER CAPITA- THAT SH-

00:24:23.995 --> 00:24:25.664
MULTIPLE LARGE NORTH BECAUSE

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:27.098
IT'S A MULTIPLE OF THIRTEEN

00:24:27.165 --> 00:24:30.435
TIMES WHAT THE LOS ANGELES

00:24:30.502 --> 00:24:32.237
REGION- AND JUST WANT TO NOTE

00:24:32.304 --> 00:24:33.672
THAT THESE MAPS AND THE TABLE

00:24:33.738 --> 00:24:35.440
CAN BE FOUND ON OUR WEBSITE AT

00:24:35.507 --> 00:24:37.642
THE GET THE- DOT ORG WHERE THE

00:24:37.709 --> 00:24:40.045
REPORT IS POSTED. THIS REGIONAL

00:24:40.111 --> 00:24:42.280
FUNDING IMBALANCE LEADS TO

00:24:42.347 --> 00:24:44.549
MASSIVE RACIAL INEQUALITY IN

00:24:44.616 --> 00:24:47.152
THE DISTRIBUTION OF PARKER- AS

00:24:47.219 --> 00:24:49.588
WE CAN SEE FROM THIS MAP WHERE

00:24:49.654 --> 00:24:51.723
BY PA CALIFORNIANS. ARE

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:54.726
CONCENTRATED IN REGIONS THAT

00:24:54.793 --> 00:24:57.095
RECEIVE. THE LEAST FUNDING AND

00:24:57.162 --> 00:24:58.830
LESSEN THEIR FAIR WHICH ARE

00:24:58.897 --> 00:25:00.966
CURRENTLY. SO THE QUESTION IS

00:25:01.032 --> 00:25:04.903
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN. THIS IS A

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:06.938
MAP OF POPULATION DENSITY IN

00:25:07.005 --> 00:25:08.974
CALICO YEAH AND IT'S

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:10.976
ESSENTIALLY A MIRROR IMAGE OF

00:25:11.042 --> 00:25:14.679
WHERE THE INVESTMENT- ARE GOING.

00:25:14.746 --> 00:25:16.348
BASICALLY WITH THE MESSAGE

00:25:16.414 --> 00:25:17.749
HEAVILY WEIGHTED TOWARD

00:25:17.816 --> 00:25:20.619
WILDFIRE PREVENTION NOT- THE

00:25:20.685 --> 00:25:23.188
HEALTH IMPACTS OF SMOKE. AND

00:25:23.255 --> 00:25:24.322
HEAVILY WEIGHTED TOWARD SEA

00:25:24.389 --> 00:25:26.858
LEVEL RISE AND EXTREME HEAT

00:25:26.925 --> 00:25:28.960
IMPACTS RELATIVELY NEGLECTED IN

00:25:29.027 --> 00:25:31.129
THE BILLS URBAN AREAS AND

00:25:31.196 --> 00:25:33.198
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WERE SHORT

00:25:33.265 --> 00:25:39.404
CHANGED. SO THE GOOD NEWS IS

00:25:39.471 --> 00:25:41.573
THAT THIS IS NOT SET IN STONE

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:42.874
AND THERE'S STILL A LOT OF

00:25:42.941 --> 00:25:46.711
OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THE- ON

00:25:46.778 --> 00:25:48.346
THE FORMULAS AND ADVANCED

00:25:48.413 --> 00:25:50.615
EQUITY HI SO WE HAVE SEVERAL

00:25:50.682 --> 00:25:53.985
RECOMMENDATIONS- FOR THE

00:25:54.052 --> 00:25:55.253
LEGISLATURE BEFORE THIS

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:58.924
COMMITTEE- MOST- OBVIOUSLY AND

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:02.060
SIMPLY IS. DEDICATING MORE

00:26:02.127 --> 00:26:06.231
FUNDING FOR EXTREME HEAT WE'LL-

00:26:06.298 --> 00:26:07.933
TAKE CARE IT WILL HELP

00:26:07.999 --> 00:26:09.000
ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE MOST

00:26:09.067 --> 00:26:10.902
DEADLY IMPACTS OF CLIMATE

00:26:10.969 --> 00:26:13.371
CHANGE CHANGE- INVESTING

00:26:13.438 --> 00:26:15.674
COOLING SOLUTIONS PUBLIC HEALTH

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.475
WORKER PROTECTIONS PARTICULARLY

00:26:17.542 --> 00:26:18.777
FOR OUTDOOR WORKERS AND

00:26:18.843 --> 00:26:20.912
WAREHOUSE WORKERS. WILL SHAPE

00:26:20.979 --> 00:26:24.082
LIVES AND ADVANCE EQUITY AT THE

00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:26.217
SAME TIME. I HATE ALL OF THE

00:26:26.284 --> 00:26:28.586
GREEN JOBS FOR WOMEN AND WE'RE

00:26:28.653 --> 00:26:29.821
RECOMMENDING A MULTI TIERED

00:26:29.888 --> 00:26:32.824
APPROACH SOME- TEXAS ARE SIMPLE

00:26:32.891 --> 00:26:34.893
LIKE DEDICATING MORE MONEY TO

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.895
PUBLIC HEALTH WHERE THE

00:26:36.962 --> 00:26:38.263
WORKFORCE IS MORE BALANCE WILL

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:40.799
TAKE CARE OF SOME OF THIS. BUT

00:26:40.865 --> 00:26:41.733
FOR TRADITIONALLY MALE

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.735
DOMINATED OCCUPATIONS IN

00:26:43.802 --> 00:26:47.072
CONSTRUCTION AND FIRE FIGHTING-

00:26:47.138 --> 00:26:48.039
CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO GET

00:26:48.106 --> 00:26:50.008
CREATIVE- CALIFORNIA SHOULD

00:26:50.075 --> 00:26:51.376
EXPLORE WAYS TO LEVERAGE STATE

00:26:51.443 --> 00:26:56.214
INVESTMENTS TO INCENTIVIZE JOB

00:26:56.281 --> 00:26:58.216

HAVE MADE SO ELOQUENTLY CLIMATE

00:27:21.172 --> 00:27:23.808
CHANGE IS HERE ON BUT THIS IS A

00:27:23.875 --> 00:27:25.877
UNIQUE MOMENT THE BUDGET

00:27:25.944 --> 00:27:30.115
SURPLUS IS IN A SENSE A GIFT TO

00:27:30.181 --> 00:27:33.451
THE STATE. AND YOU SENATORS

LIVABLE FOR OUR CHILDREN AND

00:27:44.696 --> 00:27:46.431
FUTURE GENERATIONS SO IN

00:27:46.498 --> 00:27:48.333
CLOSING THING I WOULD

TO CREATE A CLIMATE RESILIENCE

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:01.413
PLAN THAT IS MORE BALANCED

00:28:01.479 --> 00:28:04.416
EQUITABLE AND FAIR THANK YOU.

PANEL FOR QUESTIONS FROM ANY OF

00:28:09.354 --> 00:28:11.322
THE MEMBERS BUT NEXT WE'RE

00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:12.090
GONNA MOVE TO PROFESSOR ALEX

00:28:14.125 --> 00:28:15.460
ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC

00:28:15.527 --> 00:28:18.363
SCIENCES HE'S ALSO DIRECTOR OF

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:19.264
THE UCLA CENTER FOR CLIMATE

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:23.101
SCIENCE- DOCTOR HALL IF YOU ARE

00:28:23.168 --> 00:28:27.138
WITH US. YOU CAN TAKE IT AWAY.

00:28:27.205 --> 00:28:30.642
ALL RIGHT YES I AM HERE- I WANT

00:28:30.708 --> 00:28:32.410
TO THANK THE SENATOR AND THE

00:28:32.477 --> 00:28:33.778
COMMITTEE FOR INVITING ME TO

00:28:33.845 --> 00:28:36.881
PRESENT TODAY I HAVE BEEN DOING

00:28:36.948 --> 00:28:37.749
CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION

00:28:37.816 --> 00:28:39.717
RESEARCH FOR THE BETTER PART OF

00:28:39.784 --> 00:28:42.020
A DECADE NOW. AND I WANT TO

00:28:42.087 --> 00:28:42.854
SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THE

00:28:42.921 --> 00:28:43.888
LESSONS THAT WE'VE LEARNED

00:28:43.955 --> 00:28:46.024
THROUGH THE LENS OF MEGA FIRES

00:28:46.091 --> 00:28:48.860
IN AS MANY OF YOU KNOW. WE HAVE

00:28:48.927 --> 00:28:50.195
BEEN EXPERIENCING A DRAMATIC

00:28:50.261 --> 00:28:52.363
INCREASE IN MEGA FIRES- OVER

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:54.999
THE PAST FIVE YEARS OR SO- WITH

00:28:55.066 --> 00:28:56.401
BIG INCREASES IN AREA BURNED

00:28:56.468 --> 00:28:57.869
AND REALLY DRAMATIC

00:28:57.936 --> 00:28:59.471
CONSEQUENCES FOR ECOSYSTEMS AND

00:28:59.537 --> 00:29:02.273
PUBLIC HEALTH- AND IF YOU LOOK

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:04.275
AT WHERE THESE FIRES HAVE

00:29:04.342 --> 00:29:06.911
OCCURRED- THIS IS A MAP SHOWING

00:29:06.978 --> 00:29:08.279
DISTRIBUTION OF FIRES IN THE

00:29:08.346 --> 00:29:10.081
LAST COUPLE OF DECADES. THEY'VE

00:29:10.148 --> 00:29:12.016
BEEN PRIMARILY IN OUR WILD

00:29:12.083 --> 00:29:14.419
LANDS AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT- AND

00:29:14.486 --> 00:29:17.489
IF YOU COMPARE THIS MAP TO OUR-

00:29:17.555 --> 00:29:20.358
MAP OF SOCIAL VULNERABILITY- ON

00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:22.627
THE LEFT AND YOU CAN SEE THAT

00:29:22.694 --> 00:29:24.129
THERE ARE BIG DIFFERENCES

00:29:24.195 --> 00:29:26.798
BETWEEN THESE TWO MAPS THE-

00:29:26.865 --> 00:29:28.967
MOST SOCIAL VULNERABILITY IS IN

00:29:29.033 --> 00:29:31.469
OUR URBAN AREAS AND OUR FIRES

00:29:31.536 --> 00:29:32.604
ARE OCCURRING IN OUR WILD

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:34.339
LANDS. SO YOU WOULD THINK THAT

00:29:34.405 --> 00:29:37.542
IF YOU SUPPOSE THESE MAPS THAT-

00:29:37.609 --> 00:29:38.743
THERE WOULDN'T BE A LOT OF

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:40.845
VULNERABILITY- FROM WILDFIRE

00:29:40.912 --> 00:29:42.480
AMONG HER FLORAL POPULATIONS

00:29:42.547 --> 00:29:43.615
BUT OF COURSE WE AND IT'S NOT

00:29:43.681 --> 00:29:46.217
TRUE AS- MISTER WALLACE WELLS

00:29:46.284 --> 00:29:48.586
POINTED OUT- WE HAVE THIS

00:29:48.653 --> 00:29:50.255
REALLY DRAMATIC IMPACT OF

00:29:50.321 --> 00:29:52.257
WILDFIRE ON AIR QUALITY INSTANT

00:29:52.323 --> 00:29:55.193
IMAGE OF SAN FRANCISCO- IN-

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.928
LAST SEPTEMBER WHEN WE HAD A

00:29:56.995 --> 00:30:00.698
SERIES. OF MEGA FIRES IN

00:30:00.765 --> 00:30:02.767
CALIFORNIA. SO- THE QUESTION

00:30:02.834 --> 00:30:04.903
THAT ARISES YOU KNOW HOW CAN WE

00:30:04.969 --> 00:30:07.038
DO BETTER WITH REGARD TO- UP

00:30:07.105 --> 00:30:10.208
PREVENTING MEGA FIRES- AND ONE

00:30:10.275 --> 00:30:12.744
OF THE SOLUTIONS IN- ESPECIALLY

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:14.279
IN FORESTED AREAS NOT SO MUCH-

00:30:14.345 --> 00:30:15.747
CHAPARRAL REGIONS BUT IN THE

00:30:15.813 --> 00:30:18.183
FOREST IS TO DO PRESCRIBED.

00:30:18.249 --> 00:30:20.652
BURNING AND THE IDEA BEHIND

00:30:20.718 --> 00:30:21.786
PRESCRIBED BURNING IS THAT WE

00:30:21.853 --> 00:30:23.454
CAN REDUCE FUEL LOADS WE CAN

00:30:23.521 --> 00:30:25.089
RESTORE A FIRE SCENE THAT'S

00:30:25.156 --> 00:30:27.492
CLOSER TO WHAT IS NATURAL AND

00:30:27.559 --> 00:30:30.261
IN THE FORESTED AREAS- AND WE

00:30:30.328 --> 00:30:32.030
CAN THEN PREVENT SUBSEQUENT

00:30:32.096 --> 00:30:35.900
MEGA FIRES- DOWN DOWN THE ROAD.

00:30:35.967 --> 00:30:37.902
NOW THE DRAWBACK OF PRESCRIBED

00:30:37.969 --> 00:30:38.937
FIRES IT IS THAT THEY PRODUCE

00:30:39.003 --> 00:30:40.738
LOCAL EMISSIONS AND THEY DO

00:30:40.805 --> 00:30:41.906
IMPAIR QUALITY WHERE THEY

00:30:41.973 --> 00:30:44.976
OCCUR. BUT THE GOAL IS TO THEN

00:30:45.043 --> 00:30:46.711
PREVENT THESE DRAMATIC REGIONAL

00:30:46.778 --> 00:30:49.647
EMISSIONS- AND EVEN CONTINENTAL

00:30:49.714 --> 00:30:51.783
SCALE EMISSIONS WHEN WE HAVE.

00:30:51.849 --> 00:30:53.785
THESE BIG MEGA FIRES SO THIS

00:30:53.851 --> 00:30:55.720
RAISES A VERY THORNY POLICY

00:30:55.787 --> 00:30:58.523
QUESTION- WHICH IS WHO GETS

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:01.993
SMOKE FROM FIRE- DO WE HAVE LOW

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:04.028
LOW TO MEDIUM INTENSITY FIRES

00:31:04.095 --> 00:31:06.764
THAT PRODUCE LOCAL MISSIONS-

00:31:06.831 --> 00:31:07.999
LIKE THEY ARE PRESCRIBED FIRE

00:31:08.066 --> 00:31:10.935
CASE OR DO WE- HAVE THESE GIANT

00:31:11.002 --> 00:31:12.303
EMISSIONS FROM THESE MEGA FIRES

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:14.305
THAT CAN. IMPACT MANY

00:31:14.372 --> 00:31:17.275
COMMUNITIES INCLUDING OUR

00:31:17.342 --> 00:31:17.909
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN URBAN

00:31:17.976 --> 00:31:19.377
AREAS. SO TO ANSWER THIS

00:31:19.444 --> 00:31:21.779
QUESTION RIGOROUSLY- WE NEED

00:31:21.846 --> 00:31:24.949
QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS- AND SO

00:31:25.016 --> 00:31:26.451
WE NEED TO BE DEVELOPING

00:31:26.517 --> 00:31:28.253
POLICIES THAT ARE AROUND SAFE

00:31:28.319 --> 00:31:29.754
PRESCRIBING- BURNS THAT ARE

00:31:29.821 --> 00:31:31.522
EFFECTIVE AND EQUITABLE SO WE

00:31:31.589 --> 00:31:33.091
NEED TO QUANTIFY THE BENEFITS

00:31:33.157 --> 00:31:34.592
OF STRATEGIES LIKE PRESCRIBED

00:31:34.659 --> 00:31:37.161
BURNS ON FIRE RISK. AND AIR

00:31:37.228 --> 00:31:39.197
QUALITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

00:31:39.264 --> 00:31:40.565
WE NEED TO BE FOCUSING OF

00:31:40.632 --> 00:31:42.500
COURSE ON THE BENEFITS TO

00:31:42.567 --> 00:31:44.535
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES- BUT WE

00:31:44.602 --> 00:31:46.004
ALSO NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:47.138
THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THE

00:31:47.205 --> 00:31:49.907
PRESCRIBED BURNS OCCUR- AND

00:31:49.974 --> 00:31:51.676
THIS IS I THINK A VERY DELICATE

00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:53.144
BALANCING ACT AND WE REALLY

00:31:53.211 --> 00:31:54.979
NEED THE BEST SCIENCE TO BE

00:31:55.046 --> 00:31:55.780
ABLE TO ADDRESS THESE

00:31:55.847 --> 00:31:57.715
QUESTIONS. AND FINALLY WE HAVE

00:31:57.782 --> 00:31:58.750
TO DEVELOP THIS UNDERSTANDING

00:31:58.816 --> 00:32:00.018
IN THE CONTEXT OF A CHANGING

00:32:00.084 --> 00:32:02.153
CLIMATE WHERE UNFORTUNATELY

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:05.023
MEGA FIRES BECOME LARGER AS

00:32:05.089 --> 00:32:07.925
TEMPERATURES INCREASE. SO HOW

00:32:07.992 --> 00:32:09.894
DO WE DEVELOP THIS QUANTITATIVE

00:32:09.961 --> 00:32:12.263
UNDERSTANDING OF THE BENEFITS

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:12.864
OF STRATEGIES LIKE PRESCRIBED

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:15.500
BURNING. WHAT WE NEED EXTRA

00:32:15.566 --> 00:32:17.302
CHEESE AND A DEEP COLLABORATION

00:32:17.368 --> 00:32:19.037
FROM A NUMBER OF AREAS AND I'VE

00:32:19.103 --> 00:32:21.406
LISTED THESE HERE- YOU'LL NOTE

00:32:21.472 --> 00:32:22.507
THAT THESE ARE REALLY DESPERATE

00:32:22.573 --> 00:32:23.975
AREAS THESE ARE EXPERTS THAT I

00:32:24.042 --> 00:32:25.777
CAN TELL YOU ARE NOT ACCUSTOMED

00:32:25.843 --> 00:32:28.713
TO WORKING. WITH ONE ANOTHER-

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.648
AND SO WE HAVE TO FOSTER THIS

00:32:30.715 --> 00:32:32.917
TYPE OF- DEEP ENGAGEMENT ACROSS

00:32:32.984 --> 00:32:33.718
FROM WIDE VARIETY OF

00:32:33.785 --> 00:32:36.087
DISCIPLINES- AND THAT'S WHY I

00:32:36.154 --> 00:32:37.789
HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH A NUMBER

00:32:37.855 --> 00:32:41.392
OF MY COLLEAGUES- TO- TRY TO

00:32:41.459 --> 00:32:44.696
ADDRESS THESE ISSUES SO I'M

00:32:44.762 --> 00:32:45.263
I'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT IN

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:46.798
JUST A MOMENT. SO SPOKEN TO YOU

00:32:46.864 --> 00:32:48.232
ABOUT A FEW SUBTLE NEEDS

00:32:48.299 --> 00:32:50.268
RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:32:50.335 --> 00:32:53.004
WILDFIRE AND EQUITY- I'VE

00:32:53.071 --> 00:32:54.439
TALKED ABOUT THE NEED FOR CLEAN

00:32:54.505 --> 00:32:56.207
AIR FOR HEALTHY POPULATIONS AND

00:32:56.274 --> 00:32:58.142
THE NEED TO. BRING EQUITY

00:32:58.209 --> 00:32:59.210
CONSIDERATIONS WHEN WE TALK

00:32:59.277 --> 00:33:00.511
ABOUT STRATEGIES TO REDUCE

00:33:00.578 --> 00:33:03.147
WILDFIRE RISK. AND MANAGE AIR

00:33:03.214 --> 00:33:05.950
QUALITY. BUT IF WE ZOOM OUT AND

00:33:06.017 --> 00:33:07.352
THINK MORE BROADLY ABOUT

00:33:07.418 --> 00:33:09.053
WILDFIRE WE HAVE A NUMBER OF

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.089
ISSUES THAT ARE RELATED TO

00:33:11.155 --> 00:33:12.590
WILDFIRE WE HAVE MANY SOCIETAL

00:33:12.657 --> 00:33:13.958
NEEDS IN ADDITION TO THE ONES

00:33:14.025 --> 00:33:15.193
ASSOCIATED WITH AIR QUALITY AND

00:33:15.259 --> 00:33:16.794
I'LL JUST LET YOU ABSORB THESE

00:33:16.861 --> 00:33:20.198
ADS- I ALLOW THEM TO APPEAR ON

00:33:20.264 --> 00:33:21.999
THE SCREEN HERE. AND EVERY

00:33:22.066 --> 00:33:23.000
SINGLE ONE OF THESE ISSUES

00:33:23.067 --> 00:33:25.903
INVOLVES A VERY WIDE VARIETY OF

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:28.473
DISCIPLINES AND COLLABORATION-

00:33:28.539 --> 00:33:29.507
BETWEEN THE RESEARCHER

00:33:29.574 --> 00:33:30.908
COMMUNITY AND THE STAKEHOLDER

00:33:30.975 --> 00:33:32.844
AND GOVERNMENT COMMUNITIES. SO

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:34.846
WE NEED SUSTAINED AND DEEP

00:33:34.912 --> 00:33:36.681
COLLABORATION TO REALLY ADDRESS

00:33:36.748 --> 00:33:39.484
HOLISTICALLY. THE WILDFIRE

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:41.819
ISSUE. IN THE PAST YEAR SO I'VE

00:33:41.886 --> 00:33:43.287
BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH-

00:33:43.354 --> 00:33:44.589
COLLEAGUES AROUND THE STATE

00:33:44.655 --> 00:33:46.491
THANK YOU VERY AN IDEA FOR A

00:33:46.557 --> 00:33:48.292
CLIMATE AND WILDFIRE INSTITUTE

00:33:48.359 --> 00:33:49.360
IN CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD TAKE

00:33:49.427 --> 00:33:51.863
RESPONSIBILITY. FOR THIS TYPE

00:33:51.929 --> 00:33:54.465
OF CROSS DISCIPLINARY AND CROSS

00:33:54.532 --> 00:33:56.868
SECTORAL ENGAGEMENT- AND I'M

00:33:56.934 --> 00:33:58.035
HAPPY TO TALK MORE ABOUT THAT

00:33:58.102 --> 00:33:59.103
IN THE QUEUE AND I IF IT COMES

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:02.073
UP- BUT- I WOULDN'T WANT TO

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:04.108
LEAVE YOU WITH THIS MESSAGE-

00:34:04.175 --> 00:34:05.143
WHICH IS THAT WHETHER WE'RE

00:34:05.209 --> 00:34:06.711
TALKING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE

00:34:06.778 --> 00:34:08.513
ADAPTATION RELATED TO. WILDFIRE

00:34:08.579 --> 00:34:09.947
OR THE OTHER VERY PRESSING

00:34:10.014 --> 00:34:11.649
ISSUE OF WATER RESOURCES OR

00:34:11.716 --> 00:34:15.553
SINGLE ARISE- OR- EXTREME HEAT

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:17.789
AND MANY OTHER ISSUES. ALL

00:34:17.855 --> 00:34:19.557
THESE INVOLVING INVOLVE

00:35:43.608 --> 00:35:46.878
BEEN MADE REPEATEDLY THAT-

00:35:46.944 --> 00:35:48.145
CLIMATE CHANGE COSTS AND

00:35:48.212 --> 00:35:53.417
IMPACTS OR HERE. NOW AND- THE-

00:35:53.484 --> 00:35:55.920
THEY ARE PRESENT IN OUR MODERN

00:35:55.987 --> 00:35:58.956
SOCIETY AND CALIFORNIA. AND THE

00:35:59.023 --> 00:36:00.157
COSTS AND THE IMPACTS ARE

00:36:00.224 --> 00:36:02.527
GROWING AND LIKELY TO GROW

00:36:02.593 --> 00:36:04.529
THREE TIME AS WE AS AS AS THE

00:36:04.595 --> 00:36:05.796
IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE

00:36:05.863 --> 00:36:08.900
INCREASED BECAUSE- OF OUR-

00:36:08.966 --> 00:36:11.469
FAILURE OR INABILITY TO. CEASE

00:36:11.536 --> 00:36:14.105
EMITTING GREENHOUSE GASES INTO

00:36:14.171 --> 00:36:17.742
OUR ATMOSPHERE- OF COURSE AS

00:36:17.808 --> 00:36:19.844
WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH-

00:36:19.911 --> 00:36:21.812
FINANCIAL CRISES THROUGH THE

00:36:21.879 --> 00:36:25.550
IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC- THE

00:36:25.616 --> 00:36:26.851
TOTAL COST ISN'T ALWAYS WHAT

00:36:26.918 --> 00:36:28.686
MATTERS AS MUCH AS HOW IT IS

00:36:28.753 --> 00:36:30.755
DISTRIBUTED ACROSS SOCIETY AND

00:36:30.821 --> 00:36:32.056
I THINK WHAT WE'RE OBSERVING IN

00:36:32.123 --> 00:36:33.791
CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY WITH

00:36:33.858 --> 00:36:34.959
RESPECT TO THE PROBLEM F

00:36:35.026 --> 00:36:38.062
WILDFIRE. IS THAT THE IMPACTS

00:36:38.129 --> 00:36:40.097
OF CLIMATE CHANGE ARE EXTREMELY

00:36:40.164 --> 00:36:42.700
UNEQUALLY DISTRIBUTED ACROSS

00:36:42.767 --> 00:36:44.402
CALIFORNIA'S FORTY MILLION

00:36:44.468 --> 00:36:47.405
CITIZENS AND- AND THEN WE CAN

00:36:47.471 --> 00:36:49.540
DO MORE TO PROTECT OUR MOST

00:36:49.607 --> 00:36:52.243
VULNERABLE AND TO HELP THEM

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:55.112
LIVE AND THRIVE IN THE STATES

00:36:55.179 --> 00:36:57.214
AS WE CONTINUE TO FACE THIS

00:36:57.281 --> 00:36:57.982
GROWING CHALLENGE FROM CLIMATE

00:36:58.049 --> 00:36:59.984
CHANGE. I JUST WANNA GIVE THREE

00:37:00.051 --> 00:37:01.919
EXAMPLES OF HOW CLIMATE CHANGE

00:37:01.986 --> 00:37:03.120
IMPACTS ARE UNEQUALLY

00:37:03.187 --> 00:37:05.222
DISTRIBUTED TO FRAME- SOME

00:37:05.289 --> 00:37:07.224
SUGGESTIONS THAT WILL FOLLOW

00:37:07.291 --> 00:37:09.927
ONE IS NEXT- THE EXPERIENCE OF

00:37:09.994 --> 00:37:12.863
RENTERS AFTER A CATASTROPHIC

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:15.800
WILDFIRES- WE'VE HAD A NUMBER

00:37:15.866 --> 00:37:17.835
OF REALLY REALLY TRACK

00:37:17.902 --> 00:37:19.837
TRAUMATIC AND I AND

00:37:19.904 --> 00:37:22.974
CATASTROPHIC FIRES IN THE STATE

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:23.541
OF THE SOUTH AND THE NORTH-

00:37:23.608 --> 00:37:27.612
OVER THE LAST. FOUR YEARS-

00:37:27.678 --> 00:37:29.213
SHOULD BE CLEAN WHAT OCCURS AND

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.314
WE HEARD ABOUT THE SIDEWALL

00:37:30.381 --> 00:37:32.683
TECHNICIAN IN SPADES FROM FIRE

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:34.719
VICTIMS WHO CAME AND TOOK TIME

00:37:34.785 --> 00:37:37.355
TO TESTIFY AND EXPLAIN TO US

00:37:37.421 --> 00:37:38.689
HOW THEY HAD EXPERIENCED

00:37:38.756 --> 00:37:40.157
WILDFIRE TYPICALLY WHAT OCCURS

00:37:40.224 --> 00:37:42.827
AFTER A MAJOR WILDFIRE IS THAT

00:37:42.893 --> 00:37:44.929
HOMEOWNERS WHO HAVE HOMEOWNERS

00:37:44.996 --> 00:37:48.165
INSURANCE RECEIVE THE BENEFIT

00:37:48.232 --> 00:37:51.469
OF A GUARANTEED- RENTAL

00:37:51.535 --> 00:37:52.370
REIMBURSEMENT FROM THEIR

00:37:52.436 --> 00:37:53.871
INSURANCE COMPANY. AND THE

00:37:53.938 --> 00:37:55.373
IMPACT OF THAT IN A COMMUNITY

00:37:55.439 --> 00:37:56.774
THAT LOOP LOSES A MAJOR CHUNK

00:37:56.841 --> 00:37:59.110
OF HOUSING IS TO BID UP THE

00:37:59.176 --> 00:38:01.178
COST OF RENTAL HOUSING

00:38:01.245 --> 00:38:02.313
TYPICALLY RESULTING IN THE

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.915
ADDITION OF MANY LOW AND

00:38:04.982 --> 00:38:06.183
MODERATE INCOME RENTERS IN THE

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:07.752
COMMUNITY THIS HAPPENED IN

00:38:07.818 --> 00:38:09.487
CINEMA COUNTY AND NAPA COUNTY

00:38:09.553 --> 00:38:11.389
AFTER TWENTY SEVENTEEN IT

00:38:11.455 --> 00:38:13.524
HAPPENED IN THE CHICO AREA

00:38:13.591 --> 00:38:15.893
AFTER THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:19.864
CAMPFIRE. THAT IN TURN. IT IS.

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:21.332
AN ALREADY PRESSING HOUSING

00:38:21.399 --> 00:38:23.267
CRISIS FOR LOW AND MODERATE

00:38:23.334 --> 00:38:25.236
INCOME RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA

00:38:25.302 --> 00:38:28.272
AND IN THE CASE OF CHICO HAS

00:38:28.339 --> 00:38:28.706
GENERATED REALLY AN

00:38:28.773 --> 00:38:30.875
UNPRECEDENTED. HOMELESSNESS

00:38:30.941 --> 00:38:32.943
CRISIS IT'S REALLY TRANSFORMED

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:36.180
THE POLITICS OF THE REGION AND-

00:38:36.247 --> 00:38:38.115
HAS HAS LED TO JUST REALLY AND

00:38:38.182 --> 00:38:40.985
NO ENORMOUS NUMBERS. OF

00:38:41.052 --> 00:38:43.387
RESIDENTS THAT ARE UNSHELTERED

00:38:43.454 --> 00:38:46.323
AND THAT ARE- TRULY IN IN THE

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:48.225
MOST BRUTAL SENSE CLIMATE

00:38:48.292 --> 00:38:50.861
REFUGEES. ANOTHER IMPACTS OF

00:38:50.928 --> 00:38:52.229
WILDFIRES THAT IS-

00:38:52.296 --> 00:38:54.565
DISPROPORTIONATELY BORNE BY LOW

00:38:54.632 --> 00:38:55.833
AND MODERATE INCOME RESIDENTS

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:57.334
OF CALIFORNIA IS THE ONE IS THE

00:38:57.401 --> 00:38:58.602
IMPACT OF OFFER SMOKE WHICH

00:38:58.669 --> 00:39:00.304
SPENDS CAST AT SOME LENGTH. I

00:39:00.371 --> 00:39:02.239
WON'T GO INTO TOO MUCH MORE

00:39:02.306 --> 00:39:05.976
DETAIL EXCEPT TO NOTE THAT.

00:39:06.043 --> 00:39:07.678
IT'S TYPICALLY THE CASE THAT

00:39:07.745 --> 00:39:10.281
OLDER HOUSING STOCK WHICH IS

00:39:10.347 --> 00:39:11.415
THE HOUSING STOCK THAT LOW AND

00:39:11.482 --> 00:39:12.516
MODERATE INCOME PEOPLE IN

00:39:12.583 --> 00:39:14.318
CALIFORNIA TEND TO LIVE IT. IS

00:39:14.385 --> 00:39:16.654
LESS WELL INSULATED FROM SMOKE

00:39:16.721 --> 00:39:18.155
AND SMOKE IMPACTS WHAT THAT

00:39:18.222 --> 00:39:19.790
MEANS IS THAT DURING SMOKE

00:39:19.857 --> 00:39:21.959
EVENTS. WEALTHY RESIDENTS OF

00:39:22.026 --> 00:39:24.295
CALIFORNIA CAN RETREAT INDOORS

00:39:24.361 --> 00:39:26.964
CAN AFFORD THE PURCHASE OF- YOU

00:39:27.031 --> 00:39:29.333
KNOW HAVE A GREAT AIR FILTERS

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.035
FOR THEIR HOMES AND CAN LIVE IN

00:39:31.102 --> 00:39:33.804
RELATIVE SAFETY WHEREAS LOWER

00:39:33.871 --> 00:39:35.773
INCOME RESIDENTS TYPICALLY IN

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.641
RENTAL HOUSING. THAT HAS THIS

00:39:37.708 --> 00:39:39.643
HAS NOT NOT AS TIGHT SEALS ON

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:42.513
DOORS AND WINDOWS. ARE SUBJECT

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:43.848
TO INDOOR AIR QUALITY NEEDS

00:39:43.914 --> 00:39:45.950
JUST AS BAD AS THE OUTER ALL

00:39:46.016 --> 00:39:47.952
YOU REALLY HAVE NO SAFE PLACE

00:39:48.018 --> 00:39:51.021
TO GO. A THIRD IMPACT- THAT I

00:39:51.088 --> 00:39:52.056
THINK IS REALLY RELEVANT AND

00:39:52.123 --> 00:39:54.325
CONNECTS THE WILDFIRE ISSUE TO

00:39:54.391 --> 00:39:56.227
THE HEAT ISSUES THAT WERE WERE

00:39:56.293 --> 00:39:58.629
FACING CHALLENGES FROM. IS THE

00:39:58.696 --> 00:40:00.598
IMPACT FOR LOW INCOME

00:40:00.664 --> 00:40:03.367
ELECTRICITY CUSTOMERS OF RATE

00:40:03.434 --> 00:40:04.869
INCREASES DUE TO NEEDED

00:40:04.935 --> 00:40:06.370
WILDFIRE INVESTMENT. AND WE'RE

00:40:06.437 --> 00:40:08.105
SEEING A REALLY RAPID

00:40:08.172 --> 00:40:10.107
ACCELERATION IN THE RATE OF

00:40:10.174 --> 00:40:11.942
ELECTRICITY RATE INCREASES IN

00:40:12.009 --> 00:40:13.511
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT IS

00:40:13.577 --> 00:40:15.412
LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE NEED TO

00:40:15.479 --> 00:40:18.249
INVEST IN PRE HARDENING AND

00:40:18.315 --> 00:40:20.050
GREATER WEALTH FOR SAFETY. BACK

00:40:20.117 --> 00:40:22.319
AGAIN DESPITE FAIR AND CARE

00:40:22.386 --> 00:40:23.888
RATES WHICH MOST LOW AND

00:40:23.954 --> 00:40:25.289
MODERATE INCOME CUSTOMERS HAVE

00:40:25.356 --> 00:40:27.224
ACCESS TO IS A LEADING TO

00:40:27.291 --> 00:40:28.993
ACCELERATION AND COST OF.

00:40:29.059 --> 00:40:31.362
ENERGY FOR THESE CUSTOMERS AND

00:40:31.428 --> 00:40:33.631
THAT COMPROMISES THEIR ABILITY

00:40:33.697 --> 00:40:35.432
ON THE HOTTEST SUMMER DAYS TO

00:40:35.499 --> 00:40:37.067
RUN THE AIR CONDITIONER TO KEEP

00:40:37.134 --> 00:40:38.369
YOUR HOME COMFORTABLE ASSUMING

00:40:38.435 --> 00:40:41.906
THEY HAVE AIR CONDITIONER- AND

00:40:41.972 --> 00:40:42.973
SO IT'S CREATING A

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.642
DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT. THAT

00:40:44.708 --> 00:40:46.811
THEN ONCE AGAIN IS BORNE BY

00:40:46.877 --> 00:40:49.313
THOSE LEAST ABLE LEAST ABLE TO

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:56.020
MANAGE IT OR FOR IT- SO.

00:40:56.086 --> 00:40:58.122
RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE

00:40:58.189 --> 00:41:00.424
URGENTLY NEED TO FOCUS ON

00:41:00.491 --> 00:41:02.593
REDUCING OVERALL SOCIETAL RISK-

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:04.028
PROFESSOR HALL DISCUSSED THE

00:41:04.094 --> 00:41:05.496
NEED TO USE MORE PRESCRIBED

00:41:05.563 --> 00:41:08.532
FIRE IN IN OUR FORESTS TO GET

00:41:08.599 --> 00:41:10.067
GOOD FIRE BACK ON THE GROUND I

00:41:10.134 --> 00:41:12.069
COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THAT WE

00:41:12.136 --> 00:41:14.371
ALSO NEED TO REALLY FOCUS ON

00:41:14.438 --> 00:41:15.906
INCREASING THE RESILIENCE OF

00:41:15.973 --> 00:41:18.142
OUR MOST VULNERABLE AND I JUST

00:41:18.209 --> 00:41:20.277
SUGGEST THREE THREE IDEAS OR

00:41:20.344 --> 00:41:22.613
CONCEPTS THAT THAT HAVE BEEN-

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:23.814
SUGGESTED OR TRIED TO DETER

00:41:23.881 --> 00:41:26.116
WORTH SIX MORE SERIOUSLY ONE IS

00:41:26.183 --> 00:41:27.551
ONE ONE IS A PROPOSAL THAT WAS

00:41:27.618 --> 00:41:28.252
CONTAINED IN A WELFARE

00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:30.321
COMMISSION REPORTS THAT THE

00:41:30.387 --> 00:41:31.956
COMMISSION ISSUED- SEVERAL

00:41:32.022 --> 00:41:33.858
YEARS AGO. IT SUGGESTED THAT

00:41:33.924 --> 00:41:35.893
CALIFORNIA SHOULD CONSIDER SOME

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:37.294
SORT OF AN AUTOMATIC

00:41:37.361 --> 00:41:39.530
CATASTROPHIC INSURANCE PAY OUT

00:41:39.597 --> 00:41:41.265
FOR THOSE WHO LACK OTHER

COVERAGE AND ART AND ART AND

00:41:44.468 --> 00:41:46.804
ART. HARMS LOSE THEIR HOME. AS

00:41:46.871 --> 00:41:48.372
A FUNCTION OF THE CATASTROPHIC

00:41:48.439 --> 00:41:50.941
WILDFIRE. MANY RENTERS LACK

00:41:51.008 --> 00:41:53.310
RENTERS COVERAGE MANY LACKS IN

00:41:53.377 --> 00:41:54.678
CERTAINLY THEY DON'T HAVE

00:41:54.745 --> 00:41:55.246
HOMEOWNERS COVERAGE IF THEY

00:41:55.312 --> 00:41:56.947
DON'T OWN A HOME. AND THEY'RE

00:41:57.014 --> 00:41:57.982
AND THEY'RE SUBJECT TO REALLY

00:41:58.048 --> 00:41:59.884
DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:01.318
BECAUSE OF THEIR OVERALL

00:42:01.385 --> 00:42:02.620
FINANCIAL VULNERABILITY WHEN

00:42:02.686 --> 00:42:05.656
DISASTER STRIKES. ANOTHER BUT I

00:42:05.723 --> 00:42:06.957
WOULD COMMENCE TO SORT OF

00:42:07.024 --> 00:42:09.159
BROADER APPLICATION IS WHAT THE

00:42:09.226 --> 00:42:10.494
CURRENT TRIBE IS DOING IN

00:42:10.561 --> 00:42:12.496
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CAN MANAGE

00:42:12.563 --> 00:42:13.797
THE IMPACTS OF WILDFIRE SMOKE

00:42:13.864 --> 00:42:16.233
AND A VERY ACTIVE. CULTURAL

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:17.167
BURNING AND PRESCRIBED FIRE

00:42:17.234 --> 00:42:18.869
PROGRAM. THEY HAVE A LENDING

00:42:18.936 --> 00:42:20.504
LIBRARY OF HEALTH CONSULTORES

00:42:20.571 --> 00:42:22.339
BUT THE LOAN AMOUNTS TO TRIBAL

00:42:22.406 --> 00:42:24.608
ELDERS IN ADVANCE OF PRESCRIBED

00:42:24.675 --> 00:42:25.910
FIRE AND WHENEVER THERE IS A

00:42:25.976 --> 00:42:27.411
WILDFIRE NEARBY THAT MAY CAUSE

00:42:27.478 --> 00:42:28.979
SMOKE IMPACTS. I THINK WE

00:42:29.046 --> 00:42:29.947
REALLY NEED TO BE THINKING IN

00:42:30.014 --> 00:42:31.916
THOSE TERMS ABOUT REDUCING

00:42:31.982 --> 00:42:33.751
EXPOSURE WHEN WE CANNOT PREVENT

00:42:33.817 --> 00:42:35.486
ADMISSIONS FOR THE BONE LEVEL

00:42:35.552 --> 00:42:38.622
IN OUR COMMUNITIES- A SECOND

00:42:38.689 --> 00:42:40.658
STEPINAC PAIN IT IS ALSO YOU

00:42:40.724 --> 00:42:42.059
KNOW KIND OF. MENTIONED IN

00:42:42.126 --> 00:42:43.994
PASSING- EARLIER IN THE HEARING

00:42:44.061 --> 00:42:45.663
IS A CONSIDERATION OF SCHOOL

00:42:45.729 --> 00:42:48.265
RETROFITS- BOTH TO IMPROVE

00:42:48.332 --> 00:42:49.600
INDOOR AIR QUALITY FOR STUDENTS

00:42:49.667 --> 00:42:51.635
IN LOWER AIR QUALITY REGION

00:42:51.702 --> 00:42:52.569
SUCH AS THE SOUTHERN SAN

00:42:52.636 --> 00:42:57.141
JOAQUIN. COUNTY VALLEY- DURING

00:42:57.207 --> 00:42:58.275
PRE COULD WHEN AIR QUALITY IS

00:42:58.342 --> 00:43:00.744
ALREADY. OFTEN AGAIN AND NON

00:43:00.811 --> 00:43:01.845
ATTAINMENT WITH THE CLEAN AIR

00:43:01.912 --> 00:43:04.248
ACT BUT ALSO TO ENSURE THAT

00:43:04.315 --> 00:43:06.884
DURING SMOKE EVENTS. KIDS HAVE

00:43:06.951 --> 00:43:08.519
A SAFE PLACE TO SPEND TIME AT

00:43:08.585 --> 00:43:10.688
LEAST FOR EIGHT HOURS A DAY

00:43:10.754 --> 00:43:12.890
WHEN THEY ARE IN SCHOOL. I'M IN

00:43:12.957 --> 00:43:14.224
A COURSE THEY ARE GENERALLY IN

00:43:14.291 --> 00:43:16.126
SCHOOL DURING SEPTEMBER OCTOBER

00:43:16.193 --> 00:43:19.263
WHEN- THIS SMOKE IS MOST LIKELY

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:21.932
TO BE PARTICULARLY INTENSE. AT

00:43:21.999 --> 00:43:23.334
THE LARGEST SCALE WE NEED TO

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.301
REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS TO MAKE

00:43:24.368 --> 00:43:25.836
SURE THAT ALL FORTY MILLION

00:43:25.903 --> 00:43:28.305
CALIFORNIANS LIVE IN CLEAN AIR.

00:43:28.372 --> 00:43:30.774
IT IS HEALTHY TO BREEZE HANDS

00:43:30.841 --> 00:43:33.043
HAVE HOMES THAT ARE MODERN AND

00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:35.479
SAFE. SO THEY CAN BE MADE SAFE

00:43:35.546 --> 00:43:37.481
FROM WILDFIRE SMOKE. FROM

00:43:37.548 --> 00:43:39.817
EXTREME HEAT EVENTS AND FROM

00:43:39.883 --> 00:43:40.985
WHATEVER ELSE CLIMATE CHANGE

00:43:41.051 --> 00:43:43.520
THROWS AT US OVER THE NEXT

00:43:43.587 --> 00:43:44.688
COUPLE OF DECADES THANK YOU

00:43:44.755 --> 00:43:47.624
VERY MUCH OBVIOUSLY QUESTIONS

00:43:47.691 --> 00:43:50.527
AFTER. THANK YOU PROFESSOR-

00:43:50.594 --> 00:43:52.229
WILL TURN BACK TO MEMBERS OF

00:43:52.296 --> 00:43:53.864
THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS

00:43:53.931 --> 00:43:56.734
STRUCTURE. YES THANK YOU ONCE

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.635
AGAIN I HAD A QUESTION FOR

00:43:58.702 --> 00:44:00.004
PROFESSOR HALL ARE YOU STILL

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:02.139
THERE WE TALKED BRIEFLY ABOUT-

00:44:02.206 --> 00:44:03.607
PRESCRIBED BURNS IS ONE OF THE

00:44:03.674 --> 00:44:04.675
AREAS WE NEED TO DO TO BETTER

00:44:04.742 --> 00:44:06.543
MANAGE OUR FORCE OFFICE IN

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:08.278
CALIFORNIA SERVER UNIQUE STATE

00:44:08.345 --> 00:44:10.314
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE LAND IS

00:44:10.381 --> 00:44:11.849
OWNED BY OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:44:11.915 --> 00:44:12.983
AND PRIVATELY OWNED AND THEN

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:14.952
THE STATE OWNS- A PORTION OF IT

00:44:15.019 --> 00:44:18.022
AS WELL. SO ONE ISSUE IS HOW DO

00:44:18.088 --> 00:44:19.423
WE HAVE A BETTER RELATIONSHIPS

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:22.559
WITH THE OTHER FOLKS- FEDERALLY

00:44:22.626 --> 00:44:24.795
AND PRIVATELY TO- ACCESS THESE

00:44:24.862 --> 00:44:26.730
THESE LANDS TO BURN ON THE

00:44:26.797 --> 00:44:28.499
CONTROL BURNS FOR ONE FOR TWO.

00:44:28.565 --> 00:44:30.034
ALMOST ZERO TAKE PROBABLY

00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:31.835
SEVERAL YEARS TO TRY TO CLEAR

00:44:31.902 --> 00:44:35.205
OUT AS MUCH. OF THAT- OF OUR

00:44:35.272 --> 00:44:37.374
OUR LAND AS POSSIBLE. WOULD YOU

00:44:37.441 --> 00:44:39.043
HAPPEN TO KNOW BY CHANCE HOW

00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:40.177
MANY ACRES YOU THINK WE SHOULD

00:44:40.244 --> 00:44:42.212
LOOK OUT. FOR PRESCRIBED BURNS

00:44:42.279 --> 00:44:43.881
A YEAR OF TILE I DON'T KNOW HOW

00:44:43.947 --> 00:44:45.182
MANY YEARS IT WOULD TAKE TO.

00:44:45.249 --> 00:44:48.152
ADEQUATELY CONTROL ON OUR ON

00:44:48.218 --> 00:44:50.554
OUR STATE LANDS- ANY QUESTIONS

00:44:50.621 --> 00:44:56.026
ON THAT. YEAH I- I THINK THAT

00:44:56.093 --> 00:44:58.462
ON THE ISSUE OF COLLABORATION

00:44:58.529 --> 00:45:01.098
IS ONE THAT I HIGHLIGHTED- AND

00:45:01.165 --> 00:45:04.435
IT APPLIES- BUT YOU KNOW AMONG-

00:45:04.501 --> 00:45:06.003
THE LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AS

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:06.937
WELL SO LOCAL STATE AND

00:45:07.004 --> 00:45:11.075
FEDERAL- AND IN OUR- CONSORTIUM

00:45:11.141 --> 00:45:12.910
WE HAVE BEEN REACHING OUT TO

00:45:12.976 --> 00:45:15.345
FEDERAL SCIENTISTS- SO ONE ONE

00:45:15.412 --> 00:45:16.747
WAY TO APPROACH THIS AT THE

00:45:16.814 --> 00:45:18.682
FEDERAL AGENCY LEVELS TO

00:45:18.749 --> 00:45:19.249
INTERACT WITH THE SCIENTISTS

00:45:19.316 --> 00:45:21.885
AND GET THEM- BUT OF COURSE WE

00:45:21.952 --> 00:45:23.287
ALSO HAVE TO BUILD BUILD

00:45:23.353 --> 00:45:24.888
STRONGER RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE

00:45:24.955 --> 00:45:27.091
AGENCY OFFICIALS- SO I THINK

00:45:27.157 --> 00:45:28.592
THAT THAT SAY. IT'S A MATTER OF

00:45:28.659 --> 00:45:29.726
RELATIONSHIP BUILDING AND

00:45:29.793 --> 00:45:32.896
CREATING THE RESOURCES AND- THE

00:45:32.963 --> 00:45:36.733
FORUM TO ENGAGE- WHICH- YOU

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.535
KNOW I KNOW WE DO A LOT OF THAT

00:45:38.602 --> 00:45:39.169
ALREADY BUT I THINK WE NEED TO

00:45:39.236 --> 00:45:42.906
DO MORE- I THINK THE ISSUE OF

00:45:42.973 --> 00:45:46.743
SCALE IS A CHALLENGE- IT'S- YOU

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:48.045
KNOW ONE REASON WHY PRESCRIBED

00:45:48.112 --> 00:45:48.879
BURNING IS PROBABLY MORE

00:45:48.946 --> 00:45:50.314
EFFICIENT THAN JUST MECHANICAL

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:53.417
REMOVAL OF FUELS- IT'S BECAUSE

00:45:53.484 --> 00:45:54.818
LITTLE BIT A LITTLE BIT EASIER

00:45:54.885 --> 00:45:56.987
TO DO IT SCALE- I DON'T KNOW IF

00:45:57.054 --> 00:45:59.356
OFF TOP OF MY HEAD- EXACTLY HOW

00:45:59.423 --> 00:46:01.024
LONG IT WOULD TAKE. HOW MANY

00:46:01.091 --> 00:46:02.926
ACRES BUT ONE ONE THING THAT

00:46:02.993 --> 00:46:06.730
WE- COULD DO BETTER WITH IS-

00:46:06.797 --> 00:46:08.599
REALLY UNDERSTANDING THE

00:46:08.665 --> 00:46:10.234
DISTRIBUTION OF SPECIES AND

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:13.904
FUELS AND- UNDERSTANDING-

00:46:13.971 --> 00:46:15.139
STRATEGICALLY WHERE THE

00:46:15.205 --> 00:46:16.673
RESOURCES WOULD WOULD BE BEST

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:20.844
APPLIED- TO- GET THE MAXIMUM

00:46:20.911 --> 00:46:23.013
REDUCTION IN RISK- AND THAT'S

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:25.249
THE TYPE OF THAT'S AN AREA

00:46:25.315 --> 00:46:28.719
WHERE I THINK THE SCIENTIFIC

00:46:28.785 --> 00:46:31.822
COMMUNITY CAN HELP. THANK YOU-

00:46:31.889 --> 00:46:34.158
REMEMBER THE QUESTIONS I'M I

00:46:34.224 --> 00:46:38.162
JUST HAD A I HAD. ONE QUESTION-

00:46:38.228 --> 00:46:38.929
I THINK GOING BACK TO MISS

00:46:38.996 --> 00:46:41.231
COLLINS TESTIMONY WE TALKED A

00:46:41.298 --> 00:46:42.332
LOT ABOUT WILDFIRES BUT I

00:46:42.399 --> 00:46:45.035
WANTED TO ZERO IN ON. ON THE

00:46:45.102 --> 00:46:47.638
HEALTH IMPACTS THERE AND-

00:46:47.704 --> 00:46:49.039
ESPECIALLY ON SMOKE I KNOW I'VE

00:46:49.106 --> 00:46:51.208
SEEN A COUPLE STUDIES. AS OF

00:46:51.275 --> 00:46:55.546
LATE- TALKING ABOUT THE IMPACT

00:46:55.612 --> 00:47:00.250
OF WILDFIRE SMOKE ON. THE TERMBIRTHS- ON MATERNAL HEALTH. AND

00:47:00.317 --> 00:47:04.421
ALSO- ON ONG HEALTH FOR YOUNG

00:47:04.488 --> 00:47:06.523
CHILDREN I HAD READ IN THAT I

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:09.259
THINK IS A STANFORD STUDY THAT-

00:47:09.326 --> 00:47:10.861
THAT THERE WILL BE EVEN FROM

00:47:10.928 --> 00:47:12.796
ONE WILDFIRE EVENT ALONE-

00:47:12.863 --> 00:47:15.432
PERMANENT LUNG DAMAGE DONE IN

00:47:15.499 --> 00:47:17.334
THE GENETIC CODE ACTUALLY OF A

00:47:17.401 --> 00:47:19.069
CHILD'S LONGS FROM THAT KIND OF

00:47:19.136 --> 00:47:20.804
EXPOSURE I'M I WAS HOPING YOU

00:47:20.871 --> 00:47:23.840
COULD TOUCH ON- PERHAPS THAT

00:47:23.907 --> 00:47:26.977
THAT ISSUE AND- AND- I'VE GOT A

00:47:27.044 --> 00:47:29.079
FOLLOW UP QUESTION THERE BUT-

00:47:29.146 --> 00:47:32.382
BUT REALLY ZEROING IN ON- ON

00:47:32.449 --> 00:47:35.786
WOMEN AND CHILDREN- ANY FURTHER

00:47:35.852 --> 00:47:38.121
INSIGHT THERE YOU COULD LEND.

00:47:38.188 --> 00:47:42.092
YES I AM- YES THERE'S MULTIPLE

00:47:42.159 --> 00:47:44.294
STUDIES THAT SHOW IT IMPACTS ON

00:47:44.361 --> 00:47:46.296
WOMEN'S HEALTH WHEN CHILDREN

00:47:46.363 --> 00:47:48.599
HELD ON AND THERE IS A RECENT

00:47:48.665 --> 00:47:52.202
STUDY ON THAT- MENTAL HEALTH-

00:47:52.269 --> 00:47:55.205
IMPACTS OF WILDFIRE SMOKE AND

00:47:55.272 --> 00:48:00.410
HEAT. I THINK I WOULD. KIND OF-

00:48:00.477 --> 00:48:04.881
TAKE A BIGGER- VIEW OF THIS AND

00:48:04.948 --> 00:48:06.683
TALK ABOUT THE WAY REALLY THE

00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:09.319
GENDER TODAY MISSION LABOR AND

00:48:09.386 --> 00:48:10.687
AMERICAN SOCIETY OF NOT

00:48:10.754 --> 00:48:14.024
SOCIETIES AND WOMEN ARE

00:48:14.091 --> 00:48:17.127
RESPONSIBLE FOR A LOT OF THE

00:48:17.194 --> 00:48:20.097
CARETAKING INSURING THE HEALTH

00:48:20.163 --> 00:48:22.933
OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS SO THE

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.602
BURDENS OF CLIMATE CHANGE

00:48:25.669 --> 00:48:27.137
WHETHER IT'S EXTREME HEAT OR

00:48:27.204 --> 00:48:29.606
SMOKE IMPACTS FALL NOT ONLY ON

00:48:29.673 --> 00:48:31.608
WOMEN INDIVIDUALLY BUT IT FALLS

00:48:31.675 --> 00:48:33.677
ON THEM AS CARETAKERS FOR THEIR

00:48:33.744 --> 00:48:35.112
COMMUNITIES AND FOR THEIR

00:48:35.178 --> 00:48:37.614
FAMILIES. AND I WANT TO CALL

00:48:37.681 --> 00:48:40.350
ATTENTION TO ONE THING I NOTED

00:48:40.417 --> 00:48:41.985
AS WE WERE DOING THE RESEARCH

00:48:42.052 --> 00:48:44.855
ON THIS- ON THESE SCALES AND

00:48:44.921 --> 00:48:47.391
CLIMATE CHANGE AND THAT IS BAD

00:48:47.457 --> 00:48:49.293
I'M SURE THEIR VARIOUS

00:48:49.359 --> 00:48:50.827
DEFINITIONS OF A VULNERABLE

00:48:50.894 --> 00:48:53.797
COMMUNITIES- IN THE VARIOUS

00:48:53.864 --> 00:48:55.432
PLANNING DOCUMENTS AND POLICY

00:48:55.499 --> 00:48:57.968
DOCUMENTS FOR CALIFORNIA AND-

00:48:58.035 --> 00:49:02.172
USES TO DEVELOP POLICY- IN ONLY

00:49:02.239 --> 00:49:07.511
ONE OF THOSE- WAS GENDER. CAN

00:49:07.577 --> 00:49:08.912
WE CALL THAT SO I WOULD SAY

00:49:08.979 --> 00:49:10.547
KIND OF IN A OVER ARCING WAY

00:49:10.614 --> 00:49:13.784
WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE WAYS

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:17.321
THAT PEOPLE ARE MORE VULNERABLE

00:49:17.387 --> 00:49:18.955
BASED ON THEIR GENDER IN THE

00:49:19.022 --> 00:49:20.957
WAYS THAT. WE'RE THINKING ABOUT

00:49:21.024 --> 00:49:22.125
PEOPLE BEING MORE VULNERABLE

00:49:22.192 --> 00:49:23.960
BASED ON THEIR RACE AND THEIR

00:49:24.027 --> 00:49:27.464
ETHNICITY AND INCOME LEVELS AND

00:49:27.531 --> 00:49:29.366
I THINK- IT'S INCUMBENT ON

00:49:29.433 --> 00:49:31.101
CALIFORNIA TO START THINKING

00:49:31.168 --> 00:49:33.437
ABOUT THAT INCORPORATING IT

00:49:33.503 --> 00:49:34.805
INTO PLANNING DOCUMENTS AND

00:49:34.871 --> 00:49:36.039
THERE'S NO THERE'S A LOT OF

00:49:36.106 --> 00:49:38.241
WORK DONE AROUND THE WORLD ON

00:49:38.308 --> 00:49:40.977
THE SPECIFIC- IMPACT. OF

00:49:41.044 --> 00:49:42.479
CLIMATE CHANGE ON RETURN

00:49:42.546 --> 00:49:44.614
SPECIFICALLY AND BY GENDER AND

00:49:44.681 --> 00:49:45.382
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR

00:49:45.449 --> 00:49:48.318
CALIFORNIA TO UP ITS GAME ON

00:49:48.385 --> 00:49:49.986
THE SUBJECT. THANK YOU FOR THAT

00:49:50.053 --> 00:49:51.321
INSIDE IT WHAT ONE FOLLOW UP

00:49:51.388 --> 00:49:52.789
QUESTION YOU KNOW YOU TALKED

00:49:52.856 --> 00:49:54.658
ABOUT- EXTREME HEAT EVENTS

00:49:54.725 --> 00:49:56.626
HIDDEN IN THE DISTRICT I

00:49:56.693 --> 00:49:59.062
REPRESENT- THINK WOODLAND HILLS

00:49:59.129 --> 00:50:00.530
HAD THE HOTTEST DAY. IN

00:50:00.597 --> 00:50:02.199
CALIFORNIA HISTORY LAST YEAR AT

00:50:02.265 --> 00:50:05.702
A HUNDRED TWENTY ONE DEGREES-

00:50:05.769 --> 00:50:08.238
AS OPPOSED TO JUST- COUNTING ON

00:50:08.305 --> 00:50:10.073
TURNING UP OUR AIR CONDITIONING

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:12.075
UNITS AND RELYING ON THAT AS A-

00:50:12.142 --> 00:50:15.212
AS A TOOL TO SOMEHOW- AIR

00:50:15.278 --> 00:50:17.247
CONDITIONER WAY THROUGH CLIMATE

00:50:17.314 --> 00:50:19.015
DISASTERS- BUT WHEN YOU'RE

00:50:19.082 --> 00:50:21.785
TALKING ABOUT. ABILITIES TO

00:50:21.852 --> 00:50:23.186
MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF EXTREME

00:50:23.253 --> 00:50:25.455
HEAT ARE YOU ACTUALLY PROPOSING

00:50:25.522 --> 00:50:27.290
THAT WE FIND SOLUTIONS THAT'LL

00:50:27.357 --> 00:50:29.159
TAKE DOWN THE AMBIENT.

00:50:29.226 --> 00:50:32.295
TEMPERATURE IN URBAN AREAS- SO

00:50:32.362 --> 00:50:35.098
THAT. YOU KNOW THAT WITH THAT

00:50:35.165 --> 00:50:37.000
121 DEGREES DAY IS SUDDENLY SIX

00:50:37.067 --> 00:50:39.035
DEGREES COOLER AND HOW HOW

00:50:39.102 --> 00:50:40.303
WOULD YOU ACTUALLY DO THAT IS

00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:42.072
THERE A WAY TO ACTUALLY REDUCE

00:50:42.139 --> 00:50:44.541
THE TEMPERATURE- IN THESE HEAT

00:50:44.608 --> 00:50:47.077
ISLANDS. YES ABSOLUTELY THAT'S

00:50:47.144 --> 00:50:48.879
ABSOLUTELY WHAT- WE'RE

00:50:48.945 --> 00:50:51.214
RECOMMENDING THERE ARE NUMBER

00:50:51.281 --> 00:50:52.649
OF COOLING SOLUTIONS COOL

00:50:52.716 --> 00:50:56.453
PAVEMENTS COOL ROOFS- THERE. IS

00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:58.054
CREATING COOL PLAYGROUNDS ON

00:50:58.121 --> 00:51:00.023
SCHOOLS INSTEAD OF MEANS LIKE

00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:02.225
BAKING ASPHALT SURFACES THAT

00:51:02.292 --> 00:51:04.661
ARE ON PLAYGROUNDS AND FIELDS.

00:51:04.728 --> 00:51:05.395
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

00:51:05.462 --> 00:51:07.364
ORGANIZATIONS IN THE STATE WHO

00:51:07.431 --> 00:51:09.299
WORK ON THEIR CELL CALL OUT

00:51:09.366 --> 00:51:10.834
KIND OF RESOLVED PARTICULARLY

00:51:10.901 --> 00:51:12.102
WHICH IS BEEN DOING A LOT OF

00:51:12.169 --> 00:51:14.304
THIS WORK AND POTENTIALS. THIS

00:51:14.371 --> 00:51:16.273
IS PERSONAL TO ME TOO MY

00:51:16.339 --> 00:51:18.775
DAUGHTER IS AN OUTDOOR WORKER-

NEAR RIVERSIDE- LIVING AND YOU

00:51:22.579 --> 00:51:24.514
KNOW A RENTED APARTMENT WHERE

00:51:24.581 --> 00:51:27.083
THE AIR CONDITIONING. REGULARLY

00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:29.052
FAILS EVERY TIME THE

00:51:29.119 --> 00:51:30.720
TEMPERATURE GOES OVER NINETY

00:51:30.787 --> 00:51:34.024
DEGREES. I HAVEN'T YOU KNOW AND

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:34.891
SHE AND HER SISTER HAD SENT TO

00:51:34.958 --> 00:51:39.496

CAN HAVE CONFIDENCE. THAT OUR

00:51:45.635 --> 00:51:47.270
CHILDREN CAN SURVIVE IN THIS

00:51:47.337 --> 00:51:50.373
WORLD. I AM SO I WOULD

AT THIS MOMENT AND- THE URBAN

00:51:56.213 --> 00:51:58.782
HEAT ISLAND EFFECT IS ONE OF

00:51:58.849 --> 00:52:01.151
THE MOST DEVASTATING IMPACTS.

00:52:01.218 --> 00:52:03.453
OF CLIMATE CHANGE FOR MILLIONS

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:04.988
OF CALIFORNIANS AND THERE'S

00:52:05.055 --> 00:52:07.190
MANY MEASURES THAT WE CAN TAKE

00:52:07.257 --> 00:52:11.127
NOW TO MITIGATE AIR AND MAKE

00:52:11.194 --> 00:52:12.496
OUR CITIES LIVABLE. THANKS FOR

00:52:12.562 --> 00:52:14.764
THAT- ONE ONE LAST QUESTION FOR

00:52:14.831 --> 00:52:17.667
DOCTOR HALL- HOW HARD COULD IT

00:52:17.734 --> 00:52:19.836
GET I KNOW YOU'VE DONE. I KNOW

00:52:19.903 --> 00:52:21.071
YOU'VE DONE SOME ADVANCED

00:52:21.137 --> 00:52:22.172
MODELING AND GOTTEN THAT

00:52:22.239 --> 00:52:24.040
MODELING- MUCH MORE GRANULAR

00:52:24.107 --> 00:52:25.575
BUT OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT

00:52:25.642 --> 00:52:28.612
FEW YEARS HERE. AND CERTAIN

00:52:28.678 --> 00:52:29.846
PARTS OF CALIFORNIA HOW HOT.

00:52:29.913 --> 00:52:34.684
COULD GET. MUCH YEAH- WE HAVE

00:52:34.751 --> 00:52:37.854
BEEN LOOKING AT- WARMING AND

00:52:37.921 --> 00:52:39.523
CHANGES IN EXTREME HEAT OVER

00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:40.323
THE COURSE OF THE TWENTY FIRST

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:43.059
CENTURY- AND BY MID CENTURY

00:52:43.126 --> 00:52:45.128
WE'RE PROJECTING- YOU KNOW

00:52:45.195 --> 00:52:46.563
UNDER A SCENARIO WHERE

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:47.597
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

00:52:47.664 --> 00:52:49.533
CONTINUE TO INCREASE AT THE

00:52:49.599 --> 00:52:52.002
SAME RATE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN-

00:52:52.068 --> 00:52:52.969
IN OTHER WORDS THE WORLD DOES

00:52:53.036 --> 00:52:54.804
NOTHING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE-

00:52:54.871 --> 00:52:56.540
WE'RE ANTICIPATING. A WARNING

00:52:56.606 --> 00:52:58.608
OF AN ADDITIONAL FOUR OR FIVE

00:52:58.675 --> 00:52:59.876
DEGREES FAHRENHEIT BY MID

00:52:59.943 --> 00:53:02.245
CENTURY IN ABOUT EIGHT. OR NINE

00:53:02.312 --> 00:53:03.446
DEGREES FAHRENHEIT BY THE END

00:53:03.513 --> 00:53:05.682
OF THE CENTURY ON AVERAGE AND-

00:53:05.749 --> 00:53:07.183
OF COURSE THAT MEANS THAT-

00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:10.086
EXTREME HEAT- BECOMES YOU KNOW

00:53:10.153 --> 00:53:12.489
THANK. ON AVERAGE MORE EXTREME

00:53:12.556 --> 00:53:15.525
BY THAT THAT DEGREE AS WELL SO-

00:53:15.592 --> 00:53:16.860
YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT WAS A

00:53:16.927 --> 00:53:19.462
HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN- DEGREE

00:53:19.529 --> 00:53:20.897
EXTREME EVENT BECOMES A

00:53:20.964 --> 00:53:22.032
120 DEGREES STREWN ABOUT THE

00:53:22.098 --> 00:53:22.766
MAN THEY JUST BECOME THAT MUCH

00:53:22.832 --> 00:53:24.768
MORE EXTREME. BY THAT BY THAT

00:53:24.834 --> 00:53:27.470
MEASURE SO- AND ALSO WE HAVE

00:53:27.537 --> 00:53:29.072
MANY MANY MORE EXTREME HEAT

00:53:29.139 --> 00:53:30.574
EVENTS UNDER THOSE UNDER THE

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:34.544
SCENARIOS WITH THAT AMOUNT OFAVERAGE WARNING SO- JUST IN

00:53:34.611 --> 00:53:35.712
TERMS OF EXTREME HEAT YOU KNOW

00:53:35.779 --> 00:53:37.914
BY THAT MEASURE ALONE- THE

00:53:37.981 --> 00:53:39.516
IMPACTS ARE ARE GOING TO BE.

00:53:39.583 --> 00:53:41.351
PRETTY DRAMATIC AND AS WE ALL

00:53:41.418 --> 00:53:42.218
KNOW THERE ARE ALREADY BEING

00:53:42.285 --> 00:53:44.554
FELT. SO IN THEORY WE COULD

00:53:44.621 --> 00:53:46.423
BREAK A HUNDRED THIRTY DEGREES.

00:53:46.489 --> 00:53:48.525
IN CERTAIN URBAN AREA I MEAN IF

00:53:48.592 --> 00:53:51.161
WE'RE ALREADY AT ONE TWENTY ONE

00:53:51.227 --> 00:53:52.329
ONE TWENTY TWO. GOOD I SEE IN

00:53:52.395 --> 00:53:54.297
THE HEART OF CANOGA PARK. IN A

00:53:54.364 --> 00:53:58.368
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY. THE

00:53:58.435 --> 00:53:58.902
HEART OF LA HIT A HUNDRED

00:53:58.969 --> 00:53:59.536
THIRTY DEGREES. YEAH I THINK IF

00:53:59.603 --> 00:54:02.405
YOU COMBINE THAT WITH- WITH-

00:54:02.472 --> 00:54:03.607
THE URBAN HEAT ISLAND WHICH HAS

00:54:03.673 --> 00:54:06.977
BEEN NOTED- AND MAYBE WITH THAT

00:54:07.043 --> 00:54:08.345
WITH THAT ABSENCE OF STRATEGIES

00:54:08.411 --> 00:54:11.014
TO- REDUCE URBAN HEAT- LIKE THE

00:54:11.081 --> 00:54:12.015
ONES THAT THE DOCTOR CONNED

00:54:12.082 --> 00:54:14.951
MENTIONED- I THINK THAT- YOU

00:54:15.018 --> 00:54:17.654
COULD SEE TEMPERATURES AT HIGH.

00:54:17.721 --> 00:54:21.324
OKAY THAT'S- VERY SCARY- LET'S

00:54:21.391 --> 00:54:22.692
BUT LET ME JUST WRAP UP ONE ONE

00:54:22.759 --> 00:54:24.828
LAST QUESTION FOR. FRANCE OR

00:54:24.894 --> 00:54:29.332
WHERE- YOU TALKED ABOUT- WHAT

00:54:29.399 --> 00:54:30.600
THE STATE SHOULD BE DOING

00:54:30.667 --> 00:54:33.069
ABOUT- WILDFIRE SMOKE- AND

00:54:33.136 --> 00:54:35.271
DISASTER RISK ITSELF YEAH ARE

00:54:35.338 --> 00:54:36.106
WE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING

00:54:36.172 --> 00:54:37.407
BEYOND THE SCOPE OF IT THAT THE

00:54:37.474 --> 00:54:39.576
CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD CAN

00:54:39.643 --> 00:54:41.244
TACKLE IS THAT DOES THIS MEAN

00:54:41.311 --> 00:54:43.947
NEED MORE THAN JUST THE AIR

00:54:44.014 --> 00:54:46.182
QUALITY APPROACH TO THE ISSUE.

00:54:46.249 --> 00:54:51.421
WELL I THINK THE. A. R. B. IS

00:54:51.488 --> 00:54:54.524
WORKING WITH CAL FIRE AND WITH

00:54:54.591 --> 00:54:57.093
CALLOW YES TO TRY TO DEVELOP A

00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:59.362
COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY AND YOU

00:54:59.429 --> 00:55:01.231
SEE THIS IN THE JANUARY REPORT

00:55:01.297 --> 00:55:03.366
FROM DATA FOREST MANAGEMENT

00:55:03.433 --> 00:55:05.201
TASK FORCE I THINK WE'RE WE'RE

00:55:05.268 --> 00:55:06.503
ALL WORKING TO TRY TO

00:55:06.569 --> 00:55:09.039
UNDERSTAND- SOME OF THE ISSUES

00:55:09.105 --> 00:55:12.509
SAID. THAT ALEX HALL MENTIONED-

00:55:12.575 --> 00:55:13.476
PROFESSOR ALL MENTIONED WITH

00:55:13.543 --> 00:55:15.045
RESPECT TO BALANCING PRESCRIBED

00:55:15.111 --> 00:55:17.380
FIRE SMOKE AND WILDFIRE SMOKE

00:55:17.447 --> 00:55:18.882
AND HOW TO HOW TO THINK THROUGH

00:55:18.948 --> 00:55:20.617
THAT TRADE OFTEN COST BENEFIT

00:55:20.684 --> 00:55:24.788
TRADEOFF THAT SUPPLIED BY IT- I

00:55:24.854 --> 00:55:26.523
DO THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE.

00:55:26.589 --> 00:55:28.958
REALLY LOOKING BOTH AT THE

00:55:29.025 --> 00:55:30.593
ADMISSIONS SIDE REDUCING

00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:32.062
EMISSIONS AS WE AS MUCH AS WE

00:55:32.128 --> 00:55:33.430
CAN OF WILDFIRE SMOKE

00:55:33.496 --> 00:55:35.131
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT DRIFTS

00:55:35.198 --> 00:55:37.233
OVER HIGHLY POPULATED AREAS.

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:40.470
AND ALSO TAKING STEPS TO REDUCE

00:55:40.537 --> 00:55:44.340
EXPOSURE- MAKING SURE THAT THE

00:55:44.407 --> 00:55:46.409
HONORABLE POPULATIONS PREGNANT

00:55:46.476 --> 00:55:50.080
WOMEN. KIDS OLDER PEOPLE.

00:55:50.146 --> 00:55:52.348
OUTDOOR WORKERS HAVE ACCESS TO

00:55:52.415 --> 00:55:54.918
P. P. HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE

00:55:54.984 --> 00:55:56.386
INDOOR SPACES WHERE THEY CAN

00:55:56.453 --> 00:55:58.788
BREEZE AND NOT WORRY THAT THEIR

00:55:58.855 --> 00:56:00.523
LIVES ARE BEING EXPOSED TO

00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:02.358
HARMFUL LEVELS OF PARTICULATES.

00:56:02.425 --> 00:56:04.160
AND THAT'S REALLY NOT SOMETHING

00:56:04.227 --> 00:56:06.362
THAT WE'VE HAD TO DO AS FROM AN

00:56:06.429 --> 00:56:07.931
AIR REGULATORY PERSPECTIVE AS

00:56:07.997 --> 00:56:09.566
MUCH IN CALIFORNIA- GENERALLY

00:56:09.632 --> 00:56:10.400
FOCUSED ON CLEANING UP

00:56:10.467 --> 00:56:13.369
SMOKESTACKS AND TAILPIPES. AND

00:56:13.436 --> 00:56:15.605
WE'RE ENTERING A NEW ERA WHERE

00:56:15.672 --> 00:56:16.840
YOU KNOW THE FOREST IS NOT A

00:56:16.906 --> 00:56:19.175
SMOKESTACK OR TAIL PIPE YOU CAN

00:56:19.242 --> 00:56:22.312
STICK A SCRUBBER ON. AND SO

00:56:22.378 --> 00:56:23.379
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO REALLY

00:56:23.446 --> 00:56:24.447
RETHINK SOME OF THESE

00:56:24.514 --> 00:56:26.116
APPROACHES AND I MY SENSE IS

00:56:26.182 --> 00:56:28.084
THAT A RP IS REALLY IS REALLY

00:56:28.151 --> 00:56:29.385
DOING THIS AND BEGINNING TO DO

00:56:29.452 --> 00:56:30.620
IT. AND WE JUST NEED TO MAKE

00:56:30.687 --> 00:56:31.354
SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE

00:56:31.421 --> 00:56:33.156
RESOURCES TO DO THE GOOD WORK

00:56:33.223 --> 00:56:35.725
IN THE SCIENCE AND THEN ALSO

00:56:35.792 --> 00:56:37.627
THE RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:56:37.694 --> 00:56:38.928
THOSE WHO CANNOT AFFORD THE

00:56:38.995 --> 00:56:40.263
SOLUTIONS CAN GET THEIR HANDS

00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:42.031
ON THEM. AND SO WE PROTECT ALL

00:56:42.098 --> 00:56:45.435
CALIFORNIANS. AS WE MOVE INTO

00:56:45.502 --> 00:56:47.103
THIS NEW ERA. THANKS FOR THAT-

00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:48.304
ONE OF MY BIG TAKEAWAYS I THNK

00:56:48.371 --> 00:56:49.405
FROM THIS PANEL IS THAT A LOT

00:56:49.472 --> 00:56:50.140
OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH

00:56:50.206 --> 00:56:51.374
INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT YOU'VE

00:56:51.441 --> 00:56:52.675
BEEN MENTIONING STOCKPILES OF

00:56:52.742 --> 00:56:56.379
PP- AIDS TO RESPIRATORY HEALTH.

00:56:56.446 --> 00:56:58.548
A PLACE OF REFUGE IMPROVEMENTS

00:56:58.615 --> 00:57:00.416
THERE LOCAL AIR QUALITY- SAME.

00:57:00.483 --> 00:57:02.118
RESPIRATORY PROTECTIONS ARE A

00:57:02.185 --> 00:57:02.685
LOT OF THE SAME INVESTMENTS

ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALLIANCE-

00:58:31.608 --> 00:58:33.476
HERE IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE

00:58:33.543 --> 00:58:35.411
BROADER SET OF VULNERABLE

00:58:35.478 --> 00:58:36.713
COMMUNITIES THAT WE ARE

00:58:36.779 --> 00:58:38.348
FOCUSING ON TODAY WHETHER THAT

00:58:38.414 --> 00:58:40.049
BE FARMWORKER COMMUNITIES RURAL

00:58:40.116 --> 00:58:42.886
COMMUNITIES. INDIGENOUS FOLKS-

00:58:42.952 --> 00:58:45.788
AND BROADLY WORKING CLASS

00:58:45.855 --> 00:58:46.422
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ACROSS THE

00:58:46.489 --> 00:58:48.791
STATE. AS CALIFORNIA IS BEING

00:58:48.858 --> 00:58:50.660
PUSHED TO EXTREMES WE HEAR

00:58:50.727 --> 00:58:52.428
SCIENTISTS SAY THAT THERE ISN'T

00:58:52.495 --> 00:58:54.731
A NORMAL ANYMORE. AND THAT WHEN

00:58:54.797 --> 00:58:56.432
YOU ADD THESE CRISES TOGETHER

00:58:56.499 --> 00:58:59.602
THE IMPACT IS CUMULATIVE. BUT

00:58:59.669 --> 00:59:01.671
FROM VIRAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES

00:59:01.738 --> 00:59:02.805
THAT HAVE BEEN PLAYED WITH THE

00:59:02.872 --> 00:59:03.940
BURDEN OF OUR POLLUTING

00:59:04.007 --> 00:59:06.075
INDUSTRIES FOR GENERATIONS

00:59:06.142 --> 00:59:08.177
THERE'S NOTHING NEW ABOUT

00:59:08.244 --> 00:59:10.513
CUMULATIVE HEALTH IMPACTS. THIS

00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:12.181
IS THE CASE IN RICHMOND WHERE

00:59:12.248 --> 00:59:14.017
WE ORGANIZE COMMUNITIES LIVING

00:59:14.083 --> 00:59:15.084
ON THE FENCE LINE OF THE

00:59:15.151 --> 00:59:17.854
CHEVRON REFINERY. FOR US THE

00:59:17.921 --> 00:59:20.290
CLIMATE CRISIS IS PERVASIVE

00:59:20.356 --> 00:59:22.892
MEANING IT IS FELT DAILY NOT

00:59:22.959 --> 00:59:24.894
JUST DURING TIMES OF DISASTER.

00:59:24.961 --> 00:59:26.763
THAT MEANS AIRPRINT POLLUTION

00:59:26.829 --> 00:59:28.531
CHRONICALLY THAT MEANS OIL

00:59:28.598 --> 00:59:31.534
SPILLS GLARING EXPLOSIONS AS

00:59:31.601 --> 00:59:33.136
WELL AS THE BROADER IMPACTS AND

00:59:33.202 --> 00:59:35.672
HEATLEY'S BLACKOUTS POWER SHUT

00:59:35.738 --> 00:59:40.610
OFFS AND WILD FIRE SMOKE ALONG

00:59:40.677 --> 00:59:41.144
WITH THE COMPLETE NINETEEN

00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:42.211
CONDEMNING. CONDITIONAL MODEL

00:59:42.278 --> 00:59:44.647
OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT HOWEVER

00:59:44.714 --> 00:59:46.716
ARE PROVING DEEPLY INADEQUATE.

00:59:46.783 --> 00:59:48.418
THEY'RE QUITE NICE WE NEEDED TO

00:59:48.484 --> 00:59:49.485
ENTITIES LIKE SHERIFF'S

00:59:49.552 --> 00:59:51.688
DEPARTMENTS THEY RELY UPON

00:59:51.754 --> 00:59:53.456
PROTOCOLS LIKE EVACUATING TO

00:59:53.523 --> 00:59:56.125
FARAWAY SITES LIKE FAIRGROUNDS

00:59:56.192 --> 00:59:58.795
WE SHARE LYRICS IN ONE TO TWO

00:59:58.861 --> 01:00:01.030
LANGUAGES. VIED AN EMPTY SPACE

01:00:01.097 --> 01:00:03.866
WITHOUT TAILORED SERVICES THESE

01:00:03.933 --> 01:00:05.034
TYPES OF POLICIES ARE

01:00:05.101 --> 01:00:06.803
COLLECTIVELY SHUTTING OUT MANY

01:00:06.869 --> 01:00:08.438
MANY PEOPLE FROM THE SUPPORT

01:00:08.504 --> 01:00:10.640
THAT THEY NEED INCLUDING THE

01:00:10.707 --> 01:00:14.043
FOLKS THAT WE ORGANIZE. HOWEVER

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:15.778
THROUGH HISTORIC DISINVESTMENT

01:00:15.845 --> 01:00:17.647
OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE HAD TO BE

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:19.649
INCREDIBLY RESILIENT WE ARE

01:00:19.716 --> 01:00:21.384
ORGANIZING FOR CHANGE AND

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:23.019
INNOVATING LOCAL MODELS FOR

01:00:23.086 --> 01:00:25.722
CRISIS RESPONSE. WHEN DISASTERS

01:00:25.788 --> 01:00:27.390
STRIKE WE SEE TIME AND TIME

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:29.959
AGAIN COMMUNITIES COME TOGETHER

01:00:30.026 --> 01:00:31.361
PROTECTING EACH OTHER AND

01:00:31.427 --> 01:00:33.663
REBUILDING TOGETHER. IN SOME

01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:35.465
PLACES NEIGHBORS HAVE FOR

01:00:35.531 --> 01:00:36.933
MUTUAL AID NETWORKS TO SHARE

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.302
THEIR RESOURCES SCHOOLS HAVE

01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:41.337
BEEN PROVIDING FOOD TO FAMILIES

01:00:41.404 --> 01:00:43.272
AND COMMUNITY CENTERS ARE

01:00:43.339 --> 01:00:45.241
PROVIDING ELECTRICITY ACCESS.

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:46.676
HOWEVER WITHOUT PROPER

01:00:46.743 --> 01:00:48.578
INVESTMENT IN RESOURCES THERE'S

01:00:48.644 --> 01:00:51.714
ONLY SO MUCH THAT OVERBURDENED

01:00:51.781 --> 01:00:53.916
COMMUNITIES CAN DO. APRONS

01:00:53.983 --> 01:00:55.451
RESILIENCE REPORT DISASTER

01:00:55.518 --> 01:00:58.187
REPORT PUBLISHED THIS NEED AND

01:00:58.254 --> 01:01:00.523
CALLS FOR TARGETED INVESTMENTS

01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:02.692
TO BOLSTER THE SOCIAL FABRIC IN

01:01:02.759 --> 01:01:04.360
SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN OUR

01:01:04.427 --> 01:01:06.396
COMMUNITIES. THAT MEANS

01:01:06.462 --> 01:01:08.264
INVESTING IN THE SERVICES AND

01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:10.366
FACILITIES THAT ENSURE THAT

01:01:10.433 --> 01:01:12.435
PEOPLE AND NEIGHBORHOODS ARE

01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:14.037
QUICK TO RESPOND TO THE

01:01:14.103 --> 01:01:15.405
CONVERGING CRISES WE ARE

01:01:15.471 --> 01:01:17.340
EXPERIENCING AND SOCIAL

01:01:17.407 --> 01:01:19.175
INFRASTRUCTURE MEANS A VARIETY

01:01:19.242 --> 01:01:20.977
OF THESE TYPES OF EXAMPLES ARE.

01:01:21.044 --> 01:01:22.245
FACILITIES AND PUBLIC

THAT ARE REALLY SHOWING WHAT.

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:28.317
ONE EXAMPLE OF SOCIAL

01:01:28.384 --> 01:01:30.286
INFRASTRUCTURE AND A MODEL FOR

01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:31.687
A SOLUTION YOU WANT TO SEE

01:01:31.754 --> 01:01:34.090
SCALE. OUR COMMUNITY RESILIENCE

01:01:34.157 --> 01:01:36.592
HOBBS THE TRANSFORMATION OF

FACILITIES THAT OFFER SPACE TO

GATHER AND ACCESS SERVICES. NOT

01:01:46.803 --> 01:01:49.138
ONLY DURING TIMES OF CRISIS BUT

01:01:49.205 --> 01:01:51.541
ON A DAILY BASIS. THEY MAKE

POSSIBLE THE SIMULTANEOUS

01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:54.677

INSULATION OR WEATHERIZATION

01:01:59.082 --> 01:02:00.950
WE'RE BUILDING TECHNOLOGY FOR

01:02:01.017 --> 01:02:02.885
COOLING AND HEATING BUT ALSO

01:02:02.952 --> 01:02:04.554
CLEAN ENERGY INSTALLATIONS FOR

THIS LOOKS LIKE MULTIPLE

01:03:21.564 --> 01:03:23.332
MULTIPLE INVEST- INFRASTRUCTURE

THE LIMITATION OF NEIGHBORHOOD

01:06:37.693 --> 01:06:40.229
OIL DRILLING- REDUCING OUR

01:06:40.296 --> 01:06:41.864
EXPOSURE TO TOXIC CHEMICALS

01:06:41.931 --> 01:06:42.765
THAT WE CAN FIND IN OUR

01:06:58.381 --> 01:07:00.449
SO IMPORTANT- IT'S NOT ONLY

01:07:00.516 --> 01:07:02.084
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUE BUT

01:07:02.151 --> 01:07:04.487
ALSO A RACIAL INJUSTICE AND

01:07:04.553 --> 01:07:06.122
SOME OF THE RACIAL DISPARITIES-

01:07:06.188 --> 01:07:08.057
THAT ARE AFFECTED. RELEVANT TO

01:07:08.124 --> 01:07:10.159
CLIMATE CHANGE AND SO TOO MANY

01:07:10.226 --> 01:07:11.560
DAYS OF COLORS ARE MORE OFTEN

01:07:11.627 --> 01:07:13.028
SPACER AT THESE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:07:13.095 --> 01:07:14.363
HAZARDS AND I THINK THE

01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:16.966
PANELISTS BEFORE AS WELL AS-

01:07:17.032 --> 01:07:18.434
HOUSE SPEAKERS HAVE TOUCHED ON

THIS- THIS IS NOT SOMETHING

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:22.872
THAT SOON SO WE FACED- ISSUES

01:07:22.938 --> 01:07:24.407
SUCH AS WATER AND AIR QUALITY

01:07:24.473 --> 01:07:26.909
POLLUTANTS- STORMS EVEN HEAT

01:07:26.976 --> 01:07:28.677
WAVES WHICH WAS TOUCHED ON AND

01:07:28.744 --> 01:07:30.346
THEN BALANCE NOW AMPLIFIED.

01:07:30.413 --> 01:07:32.148
DURING THIS PANDEMIC THAT WE

01:07:32.214 --> 01:07:34.316
ARE IN FOR INSTANCE- POWER

01:07:34.383 --> 01:07:35.985
PLANTS AND OIL REFINERIES THAT

01:07:36.051 --> 01:07:37.887
WILL CRYING YOU KNOW LOCATED IN

01:07:37.953 --> 01:07:39.422
URBAN COMMUNITIES SUCH AS YOU

01:07:39.488 --> 01:07:40.956
KNOW- THROUGHOUT. YOU KNOW

01:07:41.023 --> 01:07:42.691
SOUTH LOS ANGELES WHERE YOU SEE

01:07:42.758 --> 01:07:44.293
BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.828
AFFECTED BY THE HEALTH IMPACT

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:47.630
AND ALSO THE REPRODUCTIVE AND

01:07:47.696 --> 01:07:49.832
NON- HARMS ARE AT THE HEART OF

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:51.400
SETTING-PRODUCE TO

01:07:51.467 --> 01:07:53.469
REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS. AND THE-

01:07:53.536 --> 01:07:55.337
INFERTILITY THEY'D BE ABLE TO

01:07:55.404 --> 01:08:00.943
PRODUCE YOU. KNOW HEALTHY

01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:01.510
OUTCOMES FOR MATERNAL. COME

01:08:01.577 --> 01:08:02.912
LATER AND- AND TO PRODUCE A

01:08:02.978 --> 01:08:05.114
FAMILY. AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT

01:08:05.181 --> 01:08:07.316
THIS WHERE IS IT THERE SITUATED

01:08:07.383 --> 01:08:08.918
THERE WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY

01:08:08.984 --> 01:08:11.520
LOCATED AND- BLACK URBAN

01:08:11.587 --> 01:08:13.155
NEIGHBORHOODS EXPOSING

01:08:13.222 --> 01:08:15.057
COMMUNITY COLOR. OR IT'LL

01:08:15.124 --> 01:08:17.092
QUALITY IN A HIGHER RISK OF

01:08:17.159 --> 01:08:18.227
DISEASE AND SOME OF CERTAIN

01:08:18.294 --> 01:08:20.029
TYPES OF CANCERS AS WELL SO THE

01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:21.797
ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY TENDS TO

01:08:21.864 --> 01:08:24.266
BE SIGNIFICANTLY WORSEN IMPORT

01:08:24.333 --> 01:08:25.468
NEIGHBORHOODS AND SO WHEN WE

01:08:25.534 --> 01:08:26.836
SAY FOUR NEIGHBORHOODS WERE

01:08:26.902 --> 01:08:28.504
LOOKING AFTER INCOME LEVELS OF

01:08:28.571 --> 01:08:30.439
THESE NEIGHBORHOODS AND ACCESS.

01:08:30.506 --> 01:08:32.875
TO RESOURCES- SO FROM TOXIC

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:35.177
WASTE AND- POLLUTED WATERS TO

01:08:35.244 --> 01:08:37.713
LITTER AND OTHER ELEMENTS ALSO

01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:39.982
NOT HAVING GREEN SPACE AND SO

01:08:40.049 --> 01:08:41.217
BEING ABLE TO HAVE A BUILT

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:42.751
ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU CAN FEEL

01:08:42.818 --> 01:08:44.753
FREE TO EXERCISE GO OUT AND

01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:46.589
WALK HOW PARKS AND HAPPY IN A

01:08:46.655 --> 01:08:48.057
LARGE GREEN SPACE WHICH YOU CAN

01:08:48.123 --> 01:08:50.192
SEE. IN OTHER COMMUNITIES-

01:08:50.259 --> 01:08:52.294
BACKS ARE MORE AFFLUENT IN LOS

01:08:52.361 --> 01:08:54.730
ANGELES AND SO AIR POLLUTION IS

01:08:54.797 --> 01:08:56.232
A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THIS

01:08:56.298 --> 01:08:58.467
UNIQUE HIGH INEQUALITY ACROSS

01:08:58.534 --> 01:08:59.502
THE WORLD THIS SPECIFICALLY

01:08:59.568 --> 01:09:01.370
WERE LOOKING AT OUR AREA HERE

01:09:01.437 --> 01:09:03.672
IN SOUTH LOS ANGELES- WORDS

01:09:03.739 --> 01:09:07.977
FILLED. WITH THE NOW LARGELY

01:09:08.043 --> 01:09:08.577
WITH POLLUTANTS. IN A RECENT

01:09:08.644 --> 01:09:10.079
STAY EIGHT SHOWN COUPLE. THAT

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:12.481
AVERAGE BLACK LATINO- READS

01:09:12.548 --> 01:09:14.617
ABOUT 40% MORE PARTICULATE

01:09:14.683 --> 01:09:16.385
MATTER FROM THAT EXHAUSTED HE

01:09:16.452 --> 01:09:18.988
LET'S SEE CARS TRUCKS BUSES.

01:09:19.054 --> 01:09:20.890
THERE ARE- COUNTERPARTS IN THE

01:09:20.956 --> 01:09:22.892
OTHER YOU KNOW- COMMUNITIES AND

01:09:22.958 --> 01:09:24.527
SO WHAT HOUSEHOLDS EARNING LESS

01:09:24.593 --> 01:09:26.128
THAN TWENTY THOUSAND A YEAR.

01:09:26.195 --> 01:09:27.663
PEOPLE WHO DON'T OWN HEARTS ARE

01:09:27.730 --> 01:09:29.598
SUFFERING FROM VEHICLE

01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:31.767
POLLUTION LEVELS ABOUT 20%

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:36.739
HIGHER THAN THE STATE AVERAGE.

01:09:36.805 --> 01:09:38.207
AND SO WATER SINCE AS I

01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:39.842
MENTIONED IT'S AN APARTMENT ALL

01:09:39.909 --> 01:09:43.312
ON ISSUE AS WELL AND SO IT'S AN

01:09:43.379 --> 01:09:45.414
ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM. FORM A

01:09:45.481 --> 01:09:47.182
SYSTEMIC RACISM WHEREBY

01:09:47.249 --> 01:09:48.484
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:49.985
DISPROPORTIONATELY BURDENED

01:09:50.052 --> 01:09:51.887
WITH HEALTH HAZARDS YOU NAME IT

01:09:51.954 --> 01:09:54.223
SO BREAST CANCER UTERINECANCER

01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:57.826
ASTHMA- AND CERTAIN TYPES OF.

01:09:57.893 --> 01:09:59.295
AS WE SAY IN LIFESTYLE-

01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:01.497
DISEASES LINKED TO WHERE WE

01:10:01.564 --> 01:10:03.532
LIVE WORK AND PLAY AND SOME OF

01:10:03.599 --> 01:10:05.234
THESE PRACTICES THAT FORCE THEM

01:10:05.301 --> 01:10:07.570
TO LIVE IN PROXIMITY TO SOURCES

01:10:07.636 --> 01:10:09.572
OF TOXIC WASTE IN LANDFILLS

01:10:09.638 --> 01:10:12.174
POWER STATIONS- MAJOR ROSIE

01:10:12.241 --> 01:10:13.342
MENTORS AND AIRBORNE

01:10:13.409 --> 01:10:15.144
PARTICULATE MATTER IN SOME LA

01:10:15.210 --> 01:10:16.211
ACTUALLY KNOWS IN CLOSE

01:10:16.278 --> 01:10:17.913

MOVING FORWARD I KNOW- ALL

01:18:19.895 --> 01:18:20.996
THREE PANELISTS TOUCHED ON IT

01:22:12.694 --> 01:22:15.830
FORTHRIGHT WAY. AND AND MOVED

01:22:15.897 --> 01:22:18.967
ALL PROGRAMS IN THAT DIRECTION.

01:22:19.034 --> 01:22:22.771

BUT IT'S HAPPENING-

01:22:47.862 --> 01:22:49.431
DISPROPORTIONATELY THESE

01:22:49.497 --> 01:22:51.633
EFFECTS TO DISADVANTAGED

PROGRAMS TO BEST SERVE. THE

01:23:20.595 --> 01:23:22.364
MOST VULNERABLE MIRACLE-

01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:24.399
POPULATIONS OF CALIFORNIA AND

01:23:24.466 --> 01:23:27.836

AND COMMUNITY FORESTRY YEAH

01:24:06.241 --> 01:24:08.510
THAT ONE GETS LESS ATTENTION

01:24:08.576 --> 01:24:10.211
BUT IS ALMOST MORE IMPORTANT

01:24:10.278 --> 01:24:12.046
THAN A LOT OF THE OTHERS

01:24:12.113 --> 01:24:15.016
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO-

01:24:15.083 --> 01:24:17.485
HEAT ISLAND EFFECTS AND- OUR

01:24:17.552 --> 01:24:19.487
URBAN FORESTRY PROGRAM IS

01:24:19.554 --> 01:24:21.489
DIRECTLY RELATED TO REDUCING

01:24:21.556 --> 01:24:22.457
THE HEAT ISLAND EFFECT BY

01:24:22.524 --> 01:24:23.958
PUTTING TREES BACK INTO URBAN

01:24:24.025 --> 01:24:25.894
AREAS. PUTTING SHADE IN URBAN

01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:27.996
AREAS REDUCING HE HEAT STRESS

01:24:28.062 --> 01:24:30.498
ON- COMMUNITIES THAT BY AND

01:24:30.565 --> 01:24:32.233
LARGE DON'T HAVE TREES IN THEM

01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:34.302
RIGHT NOW AND THAT PROGRAM IS

01:24:34.369 --> 01:24:37.272
HIGHLY DIRECTED TOWARD-

01:24:46.848 --> 01:24:50.685
COMMUNITIES. TREES ARE THE

01:24:50.752 --> 01:24:52.854
ANSWER- FURTHER WEHAVE OUR

01:24:52.921 --> 01:24:54.155
CALIFORNIA FORCED IMPROVEMENT

01:24:54.222 --> 01:24:56.257
PROGRAM FOREST LEGACY PROGRAM

01:24:56.324 --> 01:24:57.892
THOSE ARE LOOKING AT THAT KIND

01:24:57.959 --> 01:24:59.394
OF THE FORESTED AREAS AND

01:24:59.461 --> 01:25:00.929

THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO BE

01:25:18.513 --> 01:25:20.949
ABLE TO GET STARTED. SO THIS IS

01:25:21.015 --> 01:25:22.116
A PROGRAM THAT REALLY HELPS

01:25:22.183 --> 01:25:24.686
WITH THAT AND WILL REDUCE THE

01:25:24.752 --> 01:25:27.088
EFFECTS AND THE IMPACTS AND THE

01:25:27.155 --> 01:25:29.457

01:32:49.897 --> 01:32:51.499
CHALLENGE IN THIS EFFORT AND

01:32:51.565 --> 01:32:53.267
REALLY HAVE THE- THE SPEAKERS

01:32:53.334 --> 01:32:54.735
HERE TODAY AND HAVEN'T I

01:32:54.802 --> 01:32:56.537
HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO THE NEED TO A

01:32:56.604 --> 01:32:58.572
MUCH MORE INTEGRATED APPROACH.

01:32:58.639 --> 01:33:00.274
SO THE SECOND CALL THAT WE'RE

01:33:00.341 --> 01:33:01.909
WORKING TO DRIVE ON IS

01:33:01.976 --> 01:33:03.878
RECOGNIZING THAT THIS PLATFORM

01:33:03.945 --> 01:33:05.780
WILL NOT REPLACE EXISTING

01:33:05.846 --> 01:33:07.581
STATUTORILY MANDATED OR SECTOR

01:33:07.648 --> 01:33:09.216
SPECIFIC DECISION SUPPORT

01:33:09.283 --> 01:33:11.285
TOOLS. INSTEAD PULL THIS

01:33:11.352 --> 01:33:12.386
IMPORTANT CROSS SECTOR

01:33:12.453 --> 01:33:14.422
INFORMATION TOGETHER HELP

01:33:14.488 --> 01:33:15.990
DECISION MAKERS UNDERSTAND THE

01:33:16.057 --> 01:33:17.291
UNDERLYING FACTORS THAT

01:33:17.358 --> 01:33:23.798
CONTRIBUTE. TO VULNERABILITY IN

01:33:23.864 --> 01:33:24.799
THE FACE OF CLIMATE. AND THIRD.

01:33:24.865 --> 01:33:26.801
VERY- GOAL IS THE ARGUMENT TO.

01:33:26.867 --> 01:33:28.436
YOU FOR LOOKING CLIMATE RISK

01:33:28.502 --> 01:33:30.237
DATA TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE NO

01:33:30.304 --> 01:33:32.106
LONGER SOLELY RELYING ON

01:33:32.173 --> 01:33:33.975
BACKWARD LOOKING HAZARD DATA

01:33:34.041 --> 01:33:35.343
THAT DOES NOT GIVE US THE FULL

01:33:35.409 --> 01:33:37.078
PICTURE OF WHAT WE'RE FACING.

01:33:37.144 --> 01:33:38.746
AND THIS LAST POINT THAT I

01:33:38.813 --> 01:33:40.781
MENTIONED IS A GAP IN THE

01:33:40.848 --> 01:33:42.650
STATE'S CURRENT TOOL BOX IN

01:33:42.717 --> 01:33:44.151
TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO REALLY

01:33:44.218 --> 01:33:45.753
UNDERSTAND THE RISKS. IN

01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:46.988
CONTEXT OF FUTURE CLIMATE

01:33:47.054 --> 01:33:49.023
IMPACTS SO WE'RE VERY EXCITED

01:33:49.090 --> 01:33:52.560
TO BE DRIVING AROUND IN CLOSING

01:33:52.626 --> 01:33:53.160
THAT GAP WITH MY DENNIS LINE.

01:33:53.227 --> 01:33:55.262
SO ONE OF THE LAST POINT ANIME

01:33:55.329 --> 01:33:56.864
HERE BEFORE I HAND IT BACK IS I

01:33:56.931 --> 01:33:58.632
WAS ASKED TO DATE TO

01:33:58.699 --> 01:34:00.101
SPECIFICALLY PROVIDE A BRIEF

01:34:00.167 --> 01:34:02.003
COMPARISON OF HOW THIS WORK

01:34:02.069 --> 01:34:02.903
THAT WE'RE DOING THROUGH OUR

01:34:02.970 --> 01:34:04.638
PROGRAM TO DEVELOP OUR OWN WILL

01:34:04.705 --> 01:34:06.540
TO UNITY'S PLATFORM. COMPARES

01:34:06.607 --> 01:34:10.011
TO FEMA'S RECENTLY RELEASED

01:34:10.077 --> 01:34:11.245
NATIONAL RESCUE NEXT FALL. WELL

01:34:11.312 --> 01:34:12.913
IMMENSELY VALUABLE THERE ARE

01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:14.415
TWO IMPORTANT DISTINCTIONS THE

01:34:14.482 --> 01:34:16.917
FIRST IS THAT THE PAYMENT TOOL

01:34:16.984 --> 01:34:18.386
DOES NOT ADDRESS THAT GAP THAT

01:34:18.452 --> 01:34:20.588
I MENTION IT DOES NOT WITH ONE

01:34:20.654 --> 01:34:22.623
EXCEPTION. INCLUDES FORWARD

01:34:22.690 --> 01:34:23.824
LOOKING FUTURE CLIMATE

01:34:23.891 --> 01:34:25.860
PROJECTION RISK IT IS BASED ON

01:34:25.926 --> 01:34:27.661
BACKWARD LOOKING DATA WHICH IS

01:34:27.728 --> 01:34:29.263
IMPORTANT. BUT DOES NOT TELL

01:34:29.330 --> 01:34:30.498
THE WHOLE PITURE OF WHAT WE

01:34:30.564 --> 01:34:32.299
NEED TO BE ADDRESSING. SO OUR

01:34:32.366 --> 01:34:33.601
LITTLE COMMUNITIES PLATFORM

01:34:33.667 --> 01:34:35.269
AGAIN WILL BRING IN THAT FUTURE

01:34:35.336 --> 01:34:37.338
LOOKING INFORMATION FROM THE

01:34:37.405 --> 01:34:39.440
STATE'S WEALTH OF INFORMATION

01:34:39.507 --> 01:34:40.241
WE HAVE BEEN DOWNSCALED CLIMATE

01:34:40.307 --> 01:34:43.244
PROJECTION. DATA THE SECOND

01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:44.745
DIFFERENCE IS THAT HE PAYMENT

01:34:44.812 --> 01:34:45.813
TOOL TAKES AN INTERESTING

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:47.681
APPROACH ASSIGNING A COMPETENT

01:34:47.748 --> 01:34:49.417
SCORE TO EACH CENSUS TRACT

01:34:49.483 --> 01:34:50.818
ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO MAKE

01:34:50.885 --> 01:34:53.120
RELATIVE COMPARISONS. IT DOES

01:34:53.187 --> 01:34:55.089
NOT PROVIDE US IN CALIFORNIA

01:34:55.156 --> 01:34:56.624
WITH THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE

01:34:56.690 --> 01:34:58.259
RIGHT PROBLEM AND THIS

01:34:58.325 --> 01:34:59.894
DEFINITELY IS NOT A CRITICISM I

01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:01.162
THINK THIS TOOL IS VERY

01:35:01.228 --> 01:35:03.064
VALUABLE IN PROVIDING A USEFUL

01:35:03.130 --> 01:35:05.499
INITIAL SCREEN. BUT IT DOES NOT

01:35:05.566 --> 01:35:07.068
GIVE US IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:35:07.134 --> 01:35:08.803
DECISION MAKERS INSIGHT INTO

01:35:08.869 --> 01:35:10.805
HOW TO TARGET LOCAL SOLUTIONS

01:35:10.871 --> 01:35:12.640
TO LOCAL CONDITIONS. FOR

01:35:12.706 --> 01:35:14.075
EXAMPLE TO COMMUNITIES CAN HAVE

01:35:14.141 --> 01:35:15.676
THE SAME RANK AND THE SAME

01:35:15.743 --> 01:35:17.378
SCORE BUT DRIVEN BY VERY

01:35:17.445 --> 01:35:23.050
DIFFERENT RISKS. AND THE

01:35:23.117 --> 01:35:24.418
CURRENT- TOOL THIS NOT. IN INTO

01:35:24.485 --> 01:35:25.753
UNDER. HOW TO TIE AND THOSE

01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:28.222
RISKS THIS IS ALSO A GAP THAT

01:35:28.289 --> 01:35:28.823
WE'RE LOOKING TO FILL THROUGH

01:35:28.889 --> 01:35:31.292
THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PLATFORM.

01:35:31.358 --> 01:35:32.827
SO TO CONCLUDE I WANT TO

01:35:32.893 --> 01:35:34.495
HIGHLIGHT THIS WORK PRESENTS

01:35:34.562 --> 01:35:36.330
CALIFORNIA OPPORTUNITY TO

01:35:36.397 --> 01:35:37.398
CONTINUE OUR NATIONAL

01:35:37.465 --> 01:35:39.333
LEADERSHIP ON CLIMATE CHANGE

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:41.702
AND RESIDENT BINDINGS JANUARY

01:35:41.769 --> 01:35:42.236

UNDER RESOURCED COMMUNITIES

01:35:47.108 --> 01:35:48.676
PRIORITIZING INVESTMENTS IN

01:35:48.742 --> 01:35:49.610
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

01:35:49.677 --> 01:35:51.178
COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS

01:35:51.912 --> 01:35:54.048
CLIMATE IMPACTS. WILL

01:35:54.115 --> 01:35:55.416

01:35:55.483 --> 01:35:56.851
HOW THEY WILL MEET THIS

01:35:56.917 --> 01:35:58.986
LAUDABLE GOAL WHICH THEY ISSUED

01:35:59.053 --> 01:36:00.087
INITIAL GUIDANCE ON JUST

01:36:00.154 --> 01:36:02.356
YESTERDAY. OUR WORK TO DEVELOP

THE NATION VULNERABLE

01:36:04.959 --> 01:36:06.560
COMMUNITIES PLATFORM CAN SERVE

01:36:06.627 --> 01:36:08.929
AS A MODEL. SO WITH THAT I WANT

FIRE RIGHT NOW IS GOING TO BE A

01:46:17.804 --> 01:46:20.307
SMALL PIECE OF THAT BECAUSE WE

01:46:20.373 --> 01:46:22.375
HAVE A LOT OF LAND THAT'S NOT

01:46:22.442 --> 01:46:24.077
IN A HEALTHY ENOUGH STATE TO BE

01:46:24.144 --> 01:46:27.514
ABLE TO APPLY- PRESCRIBED FIRE

01:46:27.581 --> 01:46:28.515
TO IT WITHOUT HAVING

01:46:28.582 --> 01:46:31.785
CATASTROPHIC- CONEQUENCES SO

01:46:31.852 --> 01:46:33.854
WE NEED TO GET WE NEED TO FOR A

01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:36.723
WHILE DO A LOT OF FOREST AND

01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:39.860
FUELS MANAGEMENT ACTIVITY- AND

01:46:39.926 --> 01:46:41.695
THEN GET THOSE LANDS IN THE

01:46:41.762 --> 01:46:43.630
MAINTENANCE WITH WILD OR

01:46:43.697 --> 01:46:45.699
WITHOUT PRESCRIBED FIRE. AND

01:46:45.766 --> 01:46:48.535
GET US BACK TO MORE OF THAT-

01:46:48.602 --> 01:46:50.504
TRADITIONAL CULTURAL KNOWLEDGE

01:46:50.570 --> 01:46:52.472
AND USE OF FIRE ON THE

01:46:52.539 --> 01:46:54.674
LANDSCAPE THAT I WAS MENTIONING

01:46:54.741 --> 01:46:56.276
THAT INDIGENOUS PEOPLE DID

01:46:56.343 --> 01:46:59.079
BEFORE- SO WE GOT THE-

01:46:59.146 --> 01:47:01.548
ECOSYSTEM SO OUT OF BALANCE

01:47:01.615 --> 01:47:03.116
FROM WHERE THEY ARE SO RIGHT

01:47:03.183 --> 01:47:05.485

01:47:05.552 --> 01:47:08.655
THOUSANDS OF ACRES MAYBE FIFTY

01:47:08.722 --> 01:47:10.423
SIXTY THOUSAND ACRES OVER TIME

01:47:10.490 --> 01:47:12.526
THAT NUMBER SHOULD GROW AND

01:47:12.592 --> 01:47:15.061
APPROACH AT LEAST PROBABLY IN

01:47:15.128 --> 01:47:16.329
THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF HALF OF

01:47:16.396 --> 01:47:19.499
THOSE ACRES SOMEWHERE AROUND

MAJOR HEAT WAVE UNTIL YOU KILL

01:58:24.397 --> 01:58:26.165
THREE HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE-

01:58:26.232 --> 01:58:27.633
THANK YOU HAVE BEEN WARNING

THAT MY TWENTY FIFTEEN EXTREME

GROWING IN FREQUENCY AND

01:58:44.750 --> 01:58:47.653
FEROCITY. SO WHAT CAN WE DO I'D

01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:50.156
LIKE TO MAKE TWO POINTS. FIRST

01:58:50.223 --> 01:58:51.691
THERE IS THE NEED FOR EQUITABLE

THE AREA BEING HELD TWENTY WITH

01:58:59.165 --> 01:59:00.633
THE GREATEST RISK OF DISASTER

01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:02.068
ALSO THE AREAS THAT HAVE THE

01:59:02.134 --> 01:59:03.536
HIGHEST THE AFFORDABLE

01:59:03.603 --> 01:59:11.110

MANY YEARS TO GROW INTO A SITE

01:59:29.295 --> 01:59:31.030
THAT PROVIDES AMPLE SHADE. WE

01:59:31.097 --> 01:59:32.565
NEED MORE IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS

01:59:32.632 --> 01:59:36.335
