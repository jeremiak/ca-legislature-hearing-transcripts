JONES LEYVA MCGUIRE [inaudible] MONNING [inaudible] MORE LOG [inaudible] MORRELL [inaudible] PAN [inaudible] HERE ROTH [inaudible] SKINNER STERN. STONE. NUMBER. BY KASKI THANK YOU SO MUCH -- MADAM SECRETARY NOTICES THE PRESENCE OF A QUORUM GOOD MORNING AND HAPPY THURSDAY TO ALL. THIS IS OUR FINAL FULL BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARING FORGET THAT LEAVES US SCHEDULE SO FAR. AND BEFORE WE BEGIN OUR BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES DURING WHICH WE WILL FOCUS IN MORE DETAIL ON ALL OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT. AS I KNOW ALL OF MY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIRS DO AS WELL. IN RECENT YEARS THE STATE IS TAKING ACTION TO ADDRESS THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE COMPREHENSIVE HOUSING RELATED BILLS. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN INCLUDING THE CREATION OF A DEDICATED SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING VIA SB. TO THIS COMMITTEE ALSO PASSED A MAJOR HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS PACKAGE LAST YEAR INCLUDING FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN DIRECT AID FOR HOMELESSNESS TO LOCAL ENTITIES. CLEARLY MORE REMAINS TO BE DONE THIS HEARING WILL GIVE US A CHANCE TO DISCUSS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS AT A HIGH LEVEL INCLUDING THE OVERALL STRATEGY. THE RATIONALE BEHIND THE CHOSEN STRATEGY AND HOW THE PROPOSAL'S COMPLEMENT PROGRAM TO PROPOSAL'S ALREADY APPROVED BY THIS LEGISLATURE. IT WILL ALSO ALLOW US TO GET INPUT FROM BOTH STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS AS WE BEGAN OUR DELIBERATIONS. WE WILL START THE HEARING WITH THE PRESENTATION FROM THE ALEJO DESCRIBING THE CONTEXT IN WHICH WE WERE HAVING THE CONVERSATION AFTER WHICH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WILL PRESENT AND WE'LL DISCUSS THE ADMINISTRATION'S HOUSING THE HOMELESS PROPOSALS. NEXT REPRESENTATIVES FROM A CD AND CAL HFA AND THE HOMELESS COORDINATED IN FINANCING COUNCIL BE ON HAND TO GIVE US AN UPDATE ON RECENTLY ENACTED PROGRAMS IN THEIR PLANTS IMPLEMENT NEW PROGRAMS. IN BOTH THE CURRENT AND BUDGET YEAR. LASTLY WILL DISCUSS THE LOCAL PERSPECTIVE ON HOW THAT HOMELESSNESS AND THE STATE'S ROLE IN ADDRESSING BELL WILL BE I'M PLEASE IT WILL BE JOINED BY STOCKTON MAYOR MICHAEL TUBBS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO HIS COMMENTS WILL ALSO HEAR FROM COUNTY HALMOS OFFICIALS AS WELL AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS WHO DO THE HARD WORK OF ACTUALLY BUILDING THE NECESSARY HOUSING. AFTER WE CONCLUDE ALL OF THE PANEL PRESENTATIONS WE WILL OPEN THE MIKE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. WILL BEGIN TODAY'S HEARING WITH LORD AS MORALIS PRINCIPLE FISCAL AND POLICY ANALYST AT THE LA ELS OFFICE. MR THIS ONE OFTEN CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME. SENATORS -- I AM NEW TO THIS MODEL IS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AT THE REQUEST OF YOUR STAFF THIS MORNING WE WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THE COMMITTEE THAT ONE PUTS THE STATE'S HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CHALLENGES IN CONTEXT. BUT ALSO SUMMARIZES SOME OF THE RECENT MAJOR ACTION IN THIS SPACE AND THIRD IDENTIFIES SOME POSSIBLE RESPONSES THAT ARE BEING CONSIDERED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS. I WILL BE REFERRING TO THIS HAND OUT DURING THE COURSE OF MY COMMENTS. AND SO IF YOU WILL TURN TO PAGE ONE I WILL BE BECAUSE I WILL BEGIN BY DISCUSSING PERCENT ATTENTION DRIVERS TO THE STATE HIGH HOUSING COSTS. SO WHILE MANY FACTORS HAVE A ROLE IN CONTRIBUTING TO THE STATE'S HIGH HOUSING COSTS THE MOST IMPORTANT IS THE SIGNIFICANT SHORTAGE OF HOUSING PARTICULARLY IN COASTAL COMMUNITIES. TODAY AN AVERAGE HOME IN THE STATE COST ABOUT TWO POINT FIVE TIME AND RENTS ARE ABOUT 50% HIGHER THAN THE REST OF THE NATION. HISTORICALLY THE STATE HAS BUILT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND HOMES EACH YEAR -- WHICH AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE FIGURE ON PAGE ONE SIGNIFICANTLY LAGS NATIONAL TRENDS IN COASTAL COMMUNITIES. SO ALTHOUGH THE EXACT NUMBER OF HOUSING UNITS THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO BUILD A TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES ON CERTAIN. THE GENERAL MAGNITUDE IS ENORMOUS IF YOU TURN TO THE SECOND PAGE OF THE HANDOUT WE OUTLINED SOME OF OUR PRIOR RESEARCH THAT SUGGESTS THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO BUILD ABOUT TWICE AS MUCH HOUSING AS IT CURRENTLY DOES EACH YEAR. TO MEET DEMAND TO THAT MEANS IN ORDER TO SORT OF CATCH UP WITH THE SHORTFALLS IN PRIOR YEARS THE STATE NEEDS OVER THREE MILLION HOUSING UNITS. AND LASTLY ON THIS PAGE WE DISCUSS THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS WHICH AS YOU CAN SEE HISTORICALLY HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR JUST A VERY SMALL PORTION OF ALL AND YOU HOUSING BUILT IN THE STATE ANNUALLY. IN THE NEXT SECTION OF THE HANDOUT BEGINNING ON PAGE THREE WE DISCUSS AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES MANY HOUSEHOLDS IN THE STATE FAITH. THE FIGURE HERE DEMONSTRATES THAT CALIFORNIANS SPEND MORE ON HOUSING THAN IN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE NATION. AND IN PARTICULAR THE LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ARE THOSE THAT ARE MOST COST BURDENED. THE HIGH HOUSING COSTS IN THE STATE DOES CONTRIBUTE TO THE STATE'S POVERTY RATE SO WELL THE STATE'S OFFICIAL POVERTY RATE IS NEAR THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. THE STATE SUPPLEMENTAL POVERTY RATE IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ACTUALLY THE HIGHEST ON THE NATION ON THAT METRIC BECAUSE IT ACCOUNTS FOR THE STATE'S HOUSING COSTS. SO UNSURPRISINGLY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO BE COST BIRD AND THIS MEANS THAT THEY SPEND MORE THAN 30% OF THEIR INCOME ON HOUSING. AND THEREFORE MAY FACE CHALLENGES AFFORDING OTHER NECESSITIES SUCH AS FOOD AND MEDICAL CARE. IN PARTICULAR AROUND TWO TWO POINT FIVE MILLION LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ARE COST BURDEN. AND OVER ONE POINT FIVE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS FACE MORE DIRE COST PRESSURES THEY SPEND OVER 50% OF THEIR INCOME ON HOUSING. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FOUR WE ALSO DISCUSSED HOW OLD. AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES ARE AFFECTING MIDDLE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. SO ABOUT ONE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS IN THE STATE AT OR ABOVE THE MEDIAN INCOME ALSO FACED COST BURDENS AGAIN SPENDING MORE THAN IF YOU'LL TURN TO PAGE FIVE OF THE HANDOUT WE DISCUSS HOW THE NEED FOR LOW INCOME HOUSING ASSISTANCE OUTSTRIPS RESOURCES. IN RECENT DECADES FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS HAVE REALLY FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING THE AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES BY SUBSIDIZING THE CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND THEN REDUCING THE COST OF HOUSING FOR SOME HOUSEHOLDS FOR EXAMPLE THROUGH THE USE OF HOUSING VOUCHERS. THERE ABOUT THREE POINT ONE HOUSEHOLDS IN THE STATE THAT RENT HOUSING. AND ABOUT TWO POINT THREE MILLION THAT ARE VERY LOW INCOME CITIES ARE HOUSEHOLDS EARN 50% OR LESS OF THE MEDIAN INCOME IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND JUST THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES THAT WERE INVESTED IN THESE PROGRAMS AREN'T ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THIS ENTIRE POPULATION. AROUND ONE QUARTER OF THE LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ARE. ARE BENEFITING FROM SUBSIDIZE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT THIS POINT THAT'S ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS IN THE STATE -- AND SO BECAUSE THE PROGRAM THAT AIM TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING HISTORICALLY KIND OF JUST FOR SUCH A SMALL SHARE. THESE PROGRAMS ALONE HAVE NOT BEEN ENOUGH TO ADDRESS THE MAGNITUDE OF THE STATE'S -- AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES. SO HAVE YOU PROVIDED SOME CONTEXT ON THE STATE'S HOUSING CHALLENGES ON PAGE. SIX OF THE HAND OUT WE TURN TO ADDRESS SEEN HOMELESSNESS. THE STATE'S HOMELESSNESS CHALLENGES ARE LINKED TO THE STATE'S AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES RISING HOUSING COSTS. THAT HAVE EXCEEDED THE WEIGHT OVER THE RISE OF WAGES PARTICULARLY FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES PUTS CALIFORNIANS AT RISK OF HOUSING INSTABILITY AND HOMELESSNESS. THOSE WHO PAY AT LEAST HALF OF THEIR INCOME TOWARDS HOUSING ARE AT GREATEST RISK AND SO FOR THESE ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS. JOB LOSS OR UNEXPECTED EXPENSE COULD PUSH THEM INTO HOMELESSNESS. CALIFORNIA HAS MORE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN THE STATE THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE NATION. AS OF JANUARY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS LIVE IN THE STATE IS ABOUT 25% OF THE TOTAL. POPULATION OF HOMELESSNESS AROUND THE COUNTRY'S CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION IS JUST ABOUT 12% OF THE NATION WE CAN WE HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. THE LAST TWO BULLETS ON PAGE SIX PROVIDE SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF THE STATE'S HOMELESS POPULATION. AND HERE I'LL JUST POINT OUT THAT THE STATE ALSO HAS THE HIGHEST SHARE OF AN SHELTERED HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. AND SHELTERING ALL OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WE ESTIMATE WOULD COST ABOUT TWO TO THREE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. SO NOT ONLY PROVIDE A CONTEXT FOR BOTH THE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CHALLENGES WOULD PROVIDE A SUMMARY ON PAGE SEVEN OF RECENT MAJOR ACTION IN THE STATE. SO BOTH ACTION BY THE LEGISLATURE BUT ALSO BY VOTERS REFLECTS THIS RECOGNITION STATE HAS A MAJOR PROBLEM ON ITS HANDS. THE LEGISLATURE AT THE TURN-NOTED IN HER OPENING COMMENTS ADOPTED A PACKAGE OF BILLS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT TACKLE SOME OF THE AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES IN THE STATE THE PACKAGE INCLUDED. YOU FUNDING SOURCES FOR CONSTRUCTION AND REHABILITATION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. BUT ALSO CHANGES INTENDED TO STREAMLINE LOCAL APPROVALS FOR NEW HOUSING AND THAT ENCOURAGED CITIES AND COUNTIES TO PLAN FOR AN APPROVED MORE HOUSING. LEGISLATION IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ALSO MADE STRIDES IN THESE EFFORTS BY REVAMPING LOCAL PROCESSES THAT REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS USED TO ALLOCATE STATE HOUSING TARGETS BUT THEN ALSO TE METHODOLOGY THE STATE USES TO DEVELOP THOSE TARGETS. AND TO THE EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET INCLUDED SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS FOR HOMELESSNESS IN PARTICULAR WITH THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT FOR THE HOMELESS EMERGENCY AID PROGRAM. WHICH PROVIDES CARE FOR SHORT TERM SOLUTIONS ESSENTIALLY FOR HOMELESS POPULATIONS. AND SO ON PAGE EIGHT WE TURN TO SORT OF ACTIONS BY THE VOTERS. WHICH AUTHORIZED TO BONDS AS PART OF THE NOVEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN ELECTION THE FIRST WITH A FOUR BILLION DOLLAR BOND THAT SUPPORTS LOW INCOME MULTI FAMILY HOUSING. VETERANS ASSISTANCE AND OTHER HOUSING INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS AND THEN A TWO MILLION DOLLAR BOND THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME. THAT SUPPORTS PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR THOSE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS THAT EITHER ARE HOMELESS OR AT OR ARE AT RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS. AND SO ON THE FINAL PAGE OF YOUR HAND OUT -- WE DISCUSSED SORT OF THE ENORMITY OF THE CHALLENGE BEFORE POLICYMAKERS AND THAT ADDRESSING THIS CHALLENGE WILL LIKELY NEED YOU WILL NEED TO BE APPROACHED BY A NUMBER OF ANGLES AND SO WE IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF THINGS ARE BEING DISCUSSED TO UNDERSTAND BY. THE LEGISLATURE AND BY STAKEHOLDERS. ALL OF THE ITEMS ON THIS LIST INVOLVE TRADE OFFS AND ADDRESS DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE CHALLENGES THE STATE FACES. AND THE LEGISLATURE OR WELL IT COULD PURSUE A VARIETY OF OF APPROACHES WILL HAVE TO SERVE AWAY THESE TRADES TRADE OFF AS IT CONSIDERS ITS NEXT STEPS -- AND WITH THAT OF THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO TAKE ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GONNA HOLD QUESTIONS ON TO THE END OF A AND SO WE CAN HEAR FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS WELL GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. FOR TED BE HERE ALL BRIEFLY OUTLINE FIRST THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS ON HOUSING AND THEN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS ON HOMELESSNESS. THERE ARE THREE PRINCIPLES -- THAT THE GOVERNOR AND HIS ADMINISTRATION -- WERE THINKING I'VE AS WE ALL PUT TOGETHER HIS PROPOSALS ON HOUSING. THE FIRST IS THAT HOUSING HAS HISTORIC STILL FUNDAMENTALLY REMAINS A LOCAL FOR SPOTS ABILITY ITS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS THAT DRIVE THE PERMITTING PROCESS SEES AND THE ZONING PROCESS SEES AND GENERALLY TAKE THE LEAD. IN DEVELOPING PLANS FOR HOUSING FOR THEIR RESIDENTS. THE SECOND PRINCIPLE AS MISS FOUR HOURS MENTIONED IS THAT HOUSING HAS REACHED CRISIS LEVELS OF STATEWIDE IN TERMS OF LACK OF ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY. WE HAVE A MEDIAN HOME PRICE THAT'S MORE THAN DOUBLE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE WE HAVE GROWTH AND RUNS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES THAT FAR OUTSTRIPPED GROWTH IN INCOMES. AND WE ARE MILLIONS OF UNITS SHORT OF JUST WHAT WE NEED TO BUILD JUST TO KEEP UP WITH INCREASES IN POPULATION OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS. UNTIL THE THIRD PROMISE FLOWS FROM THE FIRST TWO WHICH IS THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO TAKE A ROLE IN MAKING SURE THAT WE WORK TOGETHER TO SOLVE THIS CRISIS. BUT THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS TO WORK WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND EMPOWER THEM TO STEP UP TO THAT WE ALL WORK TOGETHER JUMPSTART LOCAL LEADERSHIP TO MEET THESE GOALS. AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DO THIS NOT JUST IN THIS BUDGET AND THE BUDGET PROPOSAL WE HAVE INCLUDES A LOT OF ONE TIME FUNDING FOR TWENTY NINETEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY BUT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A LONG TERM PROPOSITION THIS PROBLEM IS NOT CAN BE SOLVED IN ONE YEAR OR TWO YEARS. OR EVEN OVER THE LIFE OF THIS ADMINISTRATION BUT WE WANT TO START RIGHT NOW AND WE'RE VERY COGNIZANT AS MADAM CHAIR MENTIONED THAT THESE PROPOSALS BUILD ON PROPOSALS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED OVER THE LAST. SEVERAL YEARS. SO WHEN IT COMES TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS ON HOUSING I THINK THE EASIEST WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IS TO BREAK IT INTO TWO BUCKETS A SHORT TERM BUCKET. AND THEN A LONG TERM BUCKET. IN THE SHORT TERM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW SPENDING TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS IN THE CURRENT IN THE BUDGET YEAR. OF THAT ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION IS FOR LOCAL AND REGIONAL PLANNING AND PRODUCTION GRANTS THAT INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. TO HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH STAFFING AND PERSONNEL WOULD PROCESSES FOR ZONING AND PERMITTING TO GIVE THEM THE RESOURCES TO ACTUALLY MEET THE GOALS THAT WE ARE SENDING OUT FOR THEM AND HOPE TO CONTINUE TO SET OUT FOR THEM. IN THE FUTURE. AND THEN AS THOSE LOCAL AND REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS MEET MILESTONES WILL HAVE AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN INCENTIVE PAYMENTS TO THESE GOVERNMENTS THAT THEY CAN USE FOR ANY GENERAL PURPOSE AND I KNOW MANY OF YOU HAVE SERVED IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO RAISE REVENUE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND SO WE THINK THIS WILL BE A GOOD INCENTIVE AGAIN IN THE SHORT TERM. TO HELP THESE GOVERNMENTS MEET THESE GOALS. THE SECOND BUCKET OF MONEY WE HAD IS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY. AD THIS IS TO EXPAND THEIR MIXED INCOME WELL [inaudible] HISTORICALLY CALIFORNIA'S ASSISTANCE ON HOUSING HAS BEEN DIRECTED TOWARD LOWER INCOME POPULATIONS THAT NEEDS TO BE THE CASE THAT IS THE CASE IT REMAINS THE CASE UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. BUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ACROSS OTHER INCOME LEVELS THAT MAY NOT BE GETTING AS MUCH SUPPORT AS THEY NEED BUT ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING CRISIS IN AFFORDING HOUSING. THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE PROPOSALS TO HELP THEM AS WELL. AND THEN THE LAST FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS TO EXPAND OUR HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROGRAMS AND THIS INCLUDES THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROGRAM THAT EXISTS. WITHIN THAT PROGRAM THERE'S A 9% PROGRAM AND A 4% PROGRAM AND THE GENEROUS IS HISTORICALLY BEEN UNDER SUBSCRIBE TO SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROVIDE MORE SUPPORT FOR THE PROGRAMS. SO THAT WE BUILD MORE UNITS THROUGH THAT VEHICLE AND THEN IN ADDITION WE HAVE ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO DEDICATE -- FOR FAMILIES THAT ARE WITHIN TO MAKE SURE AGAIN THAT WE GO ACROSS A NUMBER OF INCOME LEVELS. MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO HOUSING WHILE CONTINUING TO PRIORITIZE THE LOWEST INCOME FAMILIES. AND THEN THE LAST TWO POINTS SO MAKE ON THE GOVERNOR'S HOUSING PROPOSAL FOR THE SHORT TERM IS THAT WE ARE UNDERGOING A PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE IDENTIFYING ALL ACCESS STATE PROPERTY. THESE ARE PROPERTIES TO THE STATE ALREADY OWNS AND THAT COULD BE USED FOR A VARIETY OF MECHANISMS TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO THAT GOVERNOR HAS ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CREATE THAT LIST AND ONCE WE DO ONCE WE IDENTIFY THE MOST PROMISING CANDIDATES WE WILL FIND WAYS TO OVER THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS AND YEARS. BEGIN THE PROCESS OF TURNING SOME THOSE PARCELS THAT ARE PARTICULARLY SUITABLE INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. AND THEN THE LAST POINT I'LL MAKE ON THE SHORT TERM IS. FOR E. I. F. THESE THESE ARE ENHANCED INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES COULD BE A POSITIVE VEHICLE TO JUMPSTART THE KIND OF REGIONAL COLLABORATION THAT WE THINK IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT. AND SOLVING THIS PROBLEM AND WE ARE PROPOSING PAIRING THAT PROPOSAL WITH THE GOVERNOR'S TAX CONFIRM THE PROPOSAL TO CONFORM WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON OPPORTUNITY SOUNDS. SO WE THINK THAT WHEN WE JUMP START THE CREATION OF THE CIF THESE BY MAKING THEM EASIER TO FORM AND WE COMBINED WITH OPPORTUNITIES OWNS THAT PROMOTE INVESTMENT. IN THESE TYPES OF AREAS THAT CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN MOVING THE NEEDLE ON THE HOUSING FRONT. WHEN IT COMES TO THE LONG TERM NOT JUST IN THIS COMING YEAR BUT OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS WE RECOGNIZE CONSISTENT WITH STATUTES THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED IN MOST RECENT SESSION? THAT THE RENO GOALS TO REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT NEEDS OF REVAMPING AND THE GOVERNOR AND HIS ADMINISTRATION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. ARE COMMITTED TO DOING THAT COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT THE SCHOOLS MAKES SENSE GIVEN EACH JURISDICTION AND THEN EVENTUALLY ONCE WE COLLABORATE WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN TERMS OF COMING UP WITH THOSE GOALS. BEGIN TO ENFORCE THOSE REQUIREMENTS BUT I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THIS LONG TERM PROCESS IS SEPARATE FROM THE SHORT TERM FINDING THAT WE ARE GIVEN TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO HELP THEM COME UP WITH THESE GOALS. AND ALSO THE LYNC TWO TRANSPORTATION FUNDING WHICH I KNOW HAS GOTTEN A LOT OF ATTENTION -- FROM VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE GOALS ARE HARD BUT IT SHE VERBAL -- THEY'RE CONSISTENT WITH THAT LEGISLATION THAT ALL TO YOU ENACTED LAST YEAR AND WILL BE TAKING PLACE IN THE COMING YEARS AFTER A CONVERSATION WITH ALL OF YOU SO THERE WILL BE A LEAD TIME. THERE WILL BE A LINK TO TRANSPORTATION FUNDING THE GOVERNORHAS MADE THAT VERY CLEAR BUT ISN'T IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENING AT THE END OF A PROCESS. THAT WILL BE VERY DELIBERATE AND COLLABORATIVE US AS WELL THE GOVERNOR'S EFFORTS ON HOMELESSNESS -- AS ALL OF YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR BEFORE HE WAS GOVERNOR AND BEFORE HE WAS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR -- WAS MAYOR THE HEAD OF THE CITY AND THE COUNTY AND IN ONE OF HIS EFFORTS ON HOMELESSNESS HE ANNOUNCED IN A STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS LAST WEEK THAT HE'S ANNOUNCING ANOTHER MAYOR. MAYOR DARRELL STEINBERG HERE IN SACRAMENTO TO LEAD HIS COMMISSION ON HOMELESSNESS AND IN PARTICULAR MAKING SURE THAT WE NOT ONLY GET PEOPLE SHELTERED BUT WE PROVIDE THEM THE WRAPAROUND SERVICES THAT THEY NEED TO HOPEFULLY. MOVE OUT OF HOMELESSNESS. SO ARE KEY PROPOSAL HERE FROM A BUDGETARY PERSPECTIVE. AS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS I KNOW MISS MORE ALL TO MENTION THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS PART OF THE BUDGET. THAT ALL OF YOU ENACTED LAST YEAR THIS BUILDS ON THAT OF THAT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS SPECIFICALLY FOR THE BIG THIRTEEN THE THIRTEEN BIGGEST CITIES IN CALIFORNIA. GOING FROM LOS ANGELES WITH SEVERAL MILLION PEOPLE ALL THE WAY TO STOCKTON CALIFORNIA WITH THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE AND I KNOW MAYOR TOPS WILL BE HERE WITH US -- IN JUST A LITTLE BANGED UP TO ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS JUST FOR THOSE BIG THIRTEEN CITIES ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR JURISDICTIONS ALL ACROSS THE STATE. AND THESE WILL BE FUNDED THROUGH THESE CONTINUUM'S OF CARE WHICH ARE THESE AREAS DESIGNATED BY THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT. TO MAKE SURE THAT MONEY GETS TO WHERE IT NEEDS AND THERE IS A REGIONAL PROCESS FOR ALLOCATING AND COLLABORATING ON USING THAT MONEY. AND THEN FINALLY AS WITH THE HOUSING PROPOSAL TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR INCENTIVE PAYMENTS AS A LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HIT THESE MILESTONES WHEN IT COMES TO GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF SHELTERS. AND GETTING WHAT WE CALL POWS POSITIVE HOUSING ACTS AS HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING WE ALSO HAVE A PROPOSAL. TO AT THIS STREAMLINED AND EXPEDITE SEQUEL REVIEW FOR IN THESE HOMELESS SHELTERS AND NAVIGATION CENTERS AND MAKING SURE THAT WHATEVER -- PRIVILEGES WE GET TO SPORTS STADIUMS AS WE HAD DONE FOR PREVIOUS LEGISLATION WE ALSO GIVE THAT TO HOMELESS SHELTERS AND NAVIGATIONS. CENTERS IN ADDITION TO THAT FOR CALTRANS -- WITH WHAT'S KNOWN AS AIR SPACE WHICH IS FOR CALTRANS RIGHT OF WAY WHERE THERE MAY BE ROOM TO BUILD EMERGENCY SHELTERS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE USE THAT BECAUSE THAT IS EXISTING. GOVERNMENT STATE GOVERNMENT PROPERTY WHERE THAT SUCH USE IS SUITABLE AND FINALLY TO OTHER PROPOSALS THAT I'LL MENTION THE FIRST IS OUR HOUSING DISABILITY ADVOCACY PROGRAM WHICH I KNOW THE LEGISLATURE HAS FUNDED IN PREVIOUS YEARS. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT FUNDING IS ON GOING AND THAT'S TO MAKE SURE GOING BACK TO THE POINT ABOUT WRAPAROUND SERVICES THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND OFTEN ELIGIBLE FOR SSI BUT I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY APPLIED WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN APPLY AND THEY HAVE. ALL THE RESOUCES TO DO SO AND THAT WOULD DRAW DOWN FEDERAL MONEY YOU KNOW NOT JUST STATE MONEY. AND THEN THE LAST POINT I MENTIONED ARE THESE HOLD PERSON CARE PILOTS ARE BUDGET INCLUDES A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO EXPAND THESE PILOTS THAT HELP PEOPLE WITH THESE WRAPAROUND SERVICES. AND THAT COMES ON TOP OF OVER A BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IN FUNDING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL FOR THESE PILOTS BUT WE THINK THAT THIS CAN MAKE. A BIG DIFFERENCE SO IN SUMMARY WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF THESE ARE JUST YOUR ONE ONE TIME SPENDING PROPOSALS WE KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CANNOT BE SOLVED IN A YEAR. BUT WE WANTED TO LAY DOWN A MARKER WITH THIS BUDGET AS THE GOVERNOR IS OPENING PROPOSAL AND HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH ALL OF YOU AND THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN COME UP WITH A STRATEGY THAT MAKES SENSE. BUT FOR THE SHORT AND LONG TERM SO THANK YOU APPRECIATE THE SLIDE. AS THE LEGISLATURE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT REALLY ARE DESIRE AND EXPECTATION OF THE LA -- REALLY HELP US IN IDENTIFYING AREAS IN WHICH WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON AND PAYING ATTENTION. IN A VARIETY POLICY AREAS REALLY TO COME. TO IDENTIFY SOLUTIONS FOR APPRECIATE THAT LIST AND SO I'M CURIOUS -- AS TO WHETHER YOU HAVE A RECOMMENDATION ON WHERE THE STATE COULD TAKE ACTION SOME OF THE LOWER HANGING FRUITS. TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT WE'VE DONE IN PASS BUDGET ACTIONS TO REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE. IN THE HOUSING MARKET ON WHAT ARE DO YOU THINK SOME OF THE APPROPRIATE. LEVERS IF YOU WILL WE SHOULD BE PULLING TO TRY TO EXPEDITE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO THE ITEMS THAT APPEAR ON THAT FINALIST OF THE HOUSE OF THE HAND OUT DON'T NECESSARILY REFLECT SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS OF OUR OFFICE BETTER REALLY IDENTIFYING THE CONVERSATION THEM TAKING PLACE -- AND EVEN THOUGH I THINK SOME OF THE OPTIONS ARE IDENTIFIED THERE THAT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE THE BIGGEST THE ACT IN THE SPACE ARE ALSO THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL. UNTIL REQUIRED DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS WITH WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND THE DETAILS WILL VERY MUCH MATTER -- BUT THINGS LIKE REFORMING LOCAL ZONING LAWS ALTERING ALLOCATION OF LOCAL LOCAL TAXES TO INCENTIVIZE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT -- AND STREAMLINING SEEK A COULD POTENTIALLY MAKE MAJOR IMPACTS BUT IT'LL BE ABOUT THINKING ABOUT THE PARTICULARS. UNDERSTANDABLE THIRTY NIELSEN. AS YOU PREPARED THIS. FINANCE. HAVE YOU HAD ANY DATA OR RESEARCH THAT IS AVAILABLE TO YOU AS TO WHY WE HAVE NOT BEEN MORE SUCCESSFUL IN WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE. IT DIDN'T JUST HAPPEN THIS IS. EVOLVE OVER DECADES. HAVE YOU TRIED TO FOCUS ON SOME OF THOSE THINGS IN THE CONCENTRATION. OF THE PROBLEM AND WE HAVE FOR EXAMPLE. A LOT OF COASTAL COMMUNITIES. A SOME OF THEM HAVE COME IN AN AXE THE LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY TO EXEMPT THEM. FROM MEETING THEIR GOALS. WHICH I THINK IT'S RATHER AMAZING. THAT THESE MORE WEALTHY COMMUNITIES WOULD WANT TO HAVE AN EXEMPTION WHEN. A LITTLE TOWN IKE WHITMAN DISH CONDEMN. OR I GUESS IT WAS -- HUNTINGTON BEACH TO MAYBE THEY DESERVE THAT BUT SOME COMMUNITIES THAT CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE GREATER WEALTH AND RESOURCES. HAVE NOT STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE. END ARE NOT EVEN BE IN THE CHIDED FOR IT. SOMETHING IS GOING ON TO THE YEARS THAT HAS OF GIVEN THE COST UP. BUT NOT GIVEN INCENTIVE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF HOUSING TO PROVIDE. AN TO RELIEVE. HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THE WHAT HAVE BEEN THE FAILURES THUS FAR NOT JUST TO NEW IDEAS AHEAD BUT THE FAILURES. SO ALL MAKE A COUPLE POINTS AND THAT A COLLEAGUE OF MINE MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION ON SOME OF THE SPECIFIC DATA THAT YOU REFERENCED. BUT THE FIRST IS ONE THING THAT WE NOTICED AND LOOKING AT PREVIOUS PACKAGES -- AND THE LA -- COMMENTED ON THIS AND THEIR REPORT THERE TENDED TO BE A ONE OFF QUALITY TO THESE THINGS YOU KNOW LET'S PUT IN THIS MUCH MONEY HERE OR A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THERE. AND OUR BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES A LOT OF ONE WE HOPE TO EMPHASIZE FOR THIS BUDGET IS. THIS IS NOT A ONE TIME PROCESS THIS IS NOT A ONE TIME LEVEL OF THINKING SO WE REALLY WANTED TO FOLD THIS INTO NOT ONLY A REGIONAL STRATEGY BUT THE STRATEGY OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS BECAUSE YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT THAT YOU KNOW FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS HERE A HUNDRED MILLION. DOLLARS THERE IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM SO I THINK THAT'S THE FIRST THING THAT WE RECOGNIZE THIS TAKES A BROADER COMMITMENT AND JUST. THROWING MONEY AT IT ESPECIALLY IN A GIVEN YEAR -- I THINK THE SECOND THING IS THAT. THIS IS AN ISSUE AND YOU'RE CERTAINLY DIFFERENT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE DIFFERENT AND EACH HAS ITS OWN PRIORITIES BUT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN BUILDING OVER TIME AND SO IN THE ABSENCE OF STATE ACTION WE RECOGNIZE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THERE'S OFTEN. A FORCE FOR THE STATE TO KEEP THINGS THE WAY THEY ARE AND WHEN THE POPULATION IS GROWING THE WAY IT HAS IN CALIFORNIA WITH. A LOT OF THAT POPULATION GROWTH COMING IN THE COASTS IN PARTICULAR WERE CASA CON OUT THAT'S NOT REALLY TENABLE SOLUTION RIGHT AND WE THINK OF CALIFORNIA IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY HAD ABOUT TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE IN NINETEEN NINETY IT HAD ABOUT THIRTY MILLION PEOPLE AND NOW WE'RE JUST ABOUT AT FORTY MILLION PEOPLE AND SO. YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM THAT YOU HAVE HAPPENS IN A MONTH OR A YEAR BUT SLOWLY OVER THOSE YEARS OVER THE LAST IN NINETEEN SEVENTY AT THIRTY FORTY YEARS. IF YOU'RE NOT KEEPING UP EACH YEAR AND IF YOU'RE TEN OVER TIME THAT'S HOW YOU WIND UP MILLIONS OF HOUSING UNITS SHORT HAVE WHERE YOU NEED TO BE. A AND THEN I THINK THE LAST POINT THAT ALL NAY CASE. WHEN IT COMES TO THE PLANNING PROCESS AND CERTAINLY THE LAWSUIT WITH HUNTINGTON BEACH GOT A LOT OF ATTENTION OVER THE LAST MONTH? AND YET THERE WERE REASONS THAT SPECIFIC LAWSUITS WERE FILED IN IN TERMS OF THE HISTORY OFTHAT PROCEEDING. AS WELL AS THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS BUT I THINK THE GOVERNOR WOULD BE THE FIRST TO SAY THAT WE DO HAVE TO ENFORCE OUR HOUSING GOALS AND THE LAW BUT YOU KNOW IN MY PRESENTATION TODAY DID NOT MENTION LAWSUITS BECAUSE YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY LAWSUITS ARE NOT THE WAY THAT. WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING TOGETHER TO GET OUT OF THIS MESS. THE REASON -- HE TOOK ACTION THERE IN CONCERT WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE HOUSING ELEMENT THERE'S PLANNING. THEN THERE'S ENTITLEMENT AND GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS IS TO ACTUALLY GET UNITS READY AND THEN THERE'S ACTUALLY PRODUCING THE HOUSING AND WE KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK. AND I TALKED ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT WITH RENO TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT PROCESS FOR HOW WE ASSIGN GOALS AND HOW WE MAKE SURE JURISDICTIONS MEAT AND IS REALLY UP TO SNUFF. BUT I THINK WHICH ARE SECTIONS THAT AREN'T REALLY EVEN STEPPING UP TO THE PLATE IN TERMS OF THEIR PLANNING -- AND MEETING THAT REQUIREMENT OR EVEN WORK THAT'S AND CAN LAW AND DOUBLE OUR HOUSING PACKAGE IS MUCH BROADER THAN THAT WILL I WOULD SUGGEST THAT COMMUNITIES ARE SAYING GIVE ME EIGHT MORE YEARS AND DON'T BOTHER ME. IS ALSO AVOIDING JUST AS MUCH AS ANY COMMUNITY THAT HAD JUST HASN'T DONE ANYTHING. THEY'RE JUST NOT DOING ANYTHING AND SAYING GIVEN THIS EXEMPTION IN THE THAT I THINK WE NEED TO TIGHTEN UP ON THAT A LITTLE BIT. AND HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THE THE NEED AND HOW RIGHTEOUSLY LOOKING AT THE NEED FOR LITIGATION PREVENTION AND INSURANCE AND SUCH AS INSURANCE MEANING TO DIMINISH. THE VULNERABILITY OF COMMUNITIES FACING LWSUITS TICKLE REFORM BEING PART OF THAT HOW SERIOUS. IS THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT SICK REFORM. YES SIR TWO POINTS ON THAT FIRST IN TERMS OF HELPING COMMUNITIES MORE BROADWAY THAT'S PART OF WHY WE WANTED THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE PUT OUT -- IT'S YOU KNOW CAN GO TOWARD ULTIMATELY HOUSING PRODUCTION BUT IT'S REALLY FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND STAFFING FOR THESE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE WE WANT JURISDICTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW'S SO WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THAT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE. BOTH IN THIS BUDGET YEAR AND FOR FUTURE YEARS FOR SEQUEL REFORM THAT SOMETHING THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS MENTIONED AND I MENTIONED IN THE HOMELESSNESS CONTACTS HE'S ALSO MENTIONED IN THE HOUSING CONTACTS BUT THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ARE TAKING A LOOK AT BUT WE KNOW. WE HAVE MORE TO DO AND BRING STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER ON THAT -- I'LL HAVE SOME MORE BUT THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ME THANK YOU THANK YOU THAT CENTERS SKINNER. THANK YOU MADAM BUDGET CHAIRMAN A PRESHEAF HIS HEARING. FOR THE START OF A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THEN ALEJO. ON THE DIFFERENT FINANCE SO YOU DESCRIBED ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BE IN NEW SPENDING. AND YOU REFER TO THOSE THE SHORT TERM. BUT YOU ALL THINGS THAT OF COURSE ARE. TOTAL MORE THAN ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BE SO I WANTED TO JUST UNDERSTAND. WHICH OF THE THINGS WERE THE NEW pSPENDING I UNDERSTAND THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FOR THE LOCAL AND REGIONAL PLANNING GRANTS IS THAT. THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN INCENTIVE PAYMENTS IS PART OF THAT ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE WHAT'S THE NEXT PORTION. SO IT SAYS THAT SEVEN HER FIFTY MILLION FOR THE LOCAL GRANTS RIGHT PLUS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR MIXED INCOME LOANS RIGHT AND THEN WE'VE GOT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN AN EXPANSION OF STATE TAX CREDITS. SO YEARS SO THE ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION NEW IS THOSE THREE THINGS YES OKAY. AND THEN THE OTHER AMOUNTS. THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE HOUSING AGENCY THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION FOR FAMILIES WITHIN 68% AREA MEDIAN. AND A COUPLE OF OTHERS THOSE ARE. IN. PART OF BUDGET ALLOCATIONS MEAN OBVIOUSLY WE'D HAVE TO RENEW THEM BUT THEIR ON GOING APPROPRIATION. SO THESE ARE ALL ONE TIME APPROPRIATE SO THERE WAS A ONE TIME DOWN THERE AND THOSE ELEMENTS AND SO MONEY SO THERE'S THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION THAT PLANNING AND PRODUCTION AND THAT WITHIN THAT INCLUDES. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN INCENTIVE PAYMENTS OF THAT GETS YOU. TO SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY ARE YES SAID THOSE YES SOME THESE ARE ELEMENTS OF OTHER THING RIGHT SO I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION WAS ENCAPSULATED IN THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY CORRECT YEAH OKAY. SO BUT THE HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROGRAMS. IS THAT PART OF THE ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION NEW SPENDING SO IT IS BUT ACTUALLY WHEN THAT HITS THE BUDGET THE WAY THOSE TAX CREDITS ARE STRUCTURED IS THAT IT'S ONLY AFTER THE PROJECT IS COMPLETED -- BECAUSE THE TAX CREDITS ARE AWARDED FOR CALLING THE TAX BENEFITS OF THAT TAKES PLACE OVER SEVERAL YEARS FROM -- SO THAT A GO HEAD YES IT'S OKAY YEAH GO AHEAD OF SAID THAT LAST FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ACTUALLY WHEN I WAS -- REFERRING TO THAT -- ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CLEAR THAT INCLUDES BOTH OUR HOUSING AND ARE HOMELESSNESS PACKAGE -- SO THAT'S HOW YOU GET TO ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION. AND THEN THAT LAST FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR TAX CREDITS -- THAT WILL BE OUT IN THE OUT YEARS AND NOT THIS YEAR I SHOULD MAKE ONE POINT ABOUT THAT THAT WHAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL IN -- AND IT IT MAY BE THERE AND I DIDN'T CATCH IT BUT I DID TRY TO LOOK IN DETAIL ON THAT. IS JUST ONE OF ONE PAGE THAT KINDS OF BREAKS THAT DOWN SO THAT. WHEN WE HEAR IT VERBALLY WE DON'T -- ASSUME THAT FOR EXAMPLE THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION NCENTIVE IS SEPARATE FROM THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY SO WE JUST KIND OF SEE THAT BREAK DOWN THAT BE ACTUALLY DELIVERY AND I SHOULD MAKE ONE LAST POINT TO YOUR POINT THAT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN TAX CREDITS. FOR HER THOUGH IT DOESN'T HIT THE BUDGET RIGHT AWAY THAT IS DESIGNED AS AN ONGOING PROGRAM. SO MY SECOND QUESTION WAS THAN THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THAT YOU DESCRIBED ON HOMELESSNESS AND YOU DID BREAK THAT DOWN SO I KNOW THAT THE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED AND THE TWO HUNDRED ARE ALL PART OF THAT. FIVE BUT THAT [inaudible] FIVE IS. SUBSUMED IN THIS ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION FOR ITS FROM A IT'S A DIFFERENT ALLOCATION IS IN THE WHAT FOR IN THE ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE THAT'S BEING IT IS. ON THE RIGHT POSE A VERY GREAT SO THAT IT JUST A BREAK DOWN WITH YOU HELD A WILL MAKE SURE I GET THAT TF IS HEARING IT VERBALLY I GOT A LITTLE CONFUSED. OKAY SO THEN -- FOR THE LA JOH -- FOR ASK THE QUESTION I NOTE THAT. IN YOUR MATERIALS YOU GAVE US YOU SHOW THAT -- AS BEST AS WE CAN TELL AS OF JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA HAD ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND HOMELESS PEOPLE. YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT OF DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER WE ARE ABLE TO ACCURATELY COUNT. BECAUSE THERE'S A GOOD PORTION OF HOMELESS PEOPLE THAT REALLY DON'T WANT TO BE SEEN. THEY REALLY THERE'S A STIGMA AROUND BEING HOMELESS THEY'RE NOT THE ONES THAT ARE LIVING IN A TENT YOU KNOW THEIR COUCH SURFING OR THEY'RE IN CARS BUT THAT'S OUR BEST ESTIMATE NOW. BUT THE OTHER THING I NOTICED THAT. YOU THREE THOUSAND SO THAT'S A SMALL PROPORTION OF THAT HUNDRED AND THIRTY ARE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS. SO WHAT I THINK WE'VE SEEN IN% DATA RECENTLY IS THAT. WE THERE'S A LARGE PERCENT OF OUR HOMELESS FOLKS. WHO? OUR HAVE IN. THEIR NEWLY ON HOUSE. THEY'RE NOT PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN CHRONICALLY HOMELESS. THEY ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE JOBS THEY ARE YOU KNOW FAMILIES THEY ARE PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW WERE HOUSED. IN WHETHER THAT WAS SIX MONTHS AGO OR THREE YEARS AGO. RIGHT IN SO WHAT I ONE THING I WAS INTERESTED IN IS WHETHER WE HAVE ANY DATA. ON THE GROWTH [inaudible] OF THESE HOMELESS BECAUSE WE HAVE A PERCEPTION I THINK. IN TERMS OF WHAT WE SEE MOST VISIBLY THAT HOMELESS ROLE MENTALLY ILL AND ADDICTED. WHEN IN FACT WHAT THE WHEN WE GET INTO THE DIFFERENT -- CITIES OR COUNTIES THAT ARE. DOING A LOT OF MORE ACCURATE COUNT SIR SIR YOU KNOW DEALING WITH THOSE POPULATIONS BETTER THEY'RE SHOWING US NO. THESE ARE NEWLY HOMELESS PEOPLE THESE ARE NOT. MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE THESE ARE NOT ADDICTED PEOPLE SO DO DO WE HAVE ANY. I KNOW IT'S HARD BUT DATA ON THIS GROWTH OF THE HOMELESS. A YEAR BY YEAR. YES I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT -- THERE THERE'S RESEARCH THAT SUPPORTS THAT BECAUSE OF THAT THERE'S A A DIRECT LINK BETWEEN JUST THE THE GENERAL AFFORDABILITY ISSUES AND CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING MARKETS AND AN IN -- KIND OF FRICTIONAL NOT CHRONICALLY HOMELESS BUT AS MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED ARE KIND OF ON THE BRINK OF HOMELESSNESS AND ONE KIND OF NEGATIVE LIFE EVENT CAN KIND OF PUSH THEM INTO HOMELESS DISORGANIZED ILL OR EXPENSE AND SO. AND SO THAT IS DEFINITELY ORE PREVALENT IN CALIFORNIA THAN ANY OTHER STATES -- THERE IS SOME -- DATA IT YOU KNOW AS WE BROKE OUT IN YOUR HAND OUT HERE THAT THAT KIND OF SEPARATES -- CONNICK HOMELESSNESS FROM THE GENERAL POPULATION IN THAT DID IT DOES GO BACK SEVERAL YEARS AND WE DON'T HAVE IT ON HAND BUT WE COULD CERTAINLY CIRCLE BACK WITH. YOUR STAFF TO PROVIDE SOME OF THAT ONE CAVEAT IS THAT. I CAN BE SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO COMPARE THESE COUNTS YEAR OVER YEAR JUST BECAUSE AS YOU MENTIONED JUST THE DIFFICULTY IN DOING THE COUNTS EACH YEAR SO THERE'S JUST SOME. KIND OF JUST SOME NOISE EACH YEAR IN THE NUMBERS -- AND ALSO BECAUSE THERE'S KIND OF CHANGING DEFINITIONS AND METHODOLOGIES AND THE WAY THAT THE COUNCIL BEEN DONE OVER YEARS BUT WITH TIS CABBIE OUT SOME MIND KIND OF LOOKING AT THE GENERAL TREND OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS -- YOU KNOW YOU THINK YOU CAN YOU CAN GET A SENSE AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO CIRCLE BACK WITH YOU AND SO I THINK -- YOU KNOW I'M NOT ABOUT TO RECOMMEND NECESSARILY A NEW EXPENDITURE IN THE BUDGET BY THINK. ADDITIONAL DATA WOULD HELP US BECAUSE AS WE CONSIDER WHERE WE PUT. HOMELESS MONEY FOR EXAMPLE -- UNDERSTANDING THE POPULATION. CAN REALLY ASSIST US FIGURE OUT WHERE IT COULD BE MOST EFFECTIVE. AND SO ANY -- ANY ASSISTANCE IN THAT FROM LA -- WOULD BE HELPFUL EITHER HOW WE CAN GET BETTER DATA OR HOW QUEEN VALUE WITH THAT WHICH LEADS ME TO MY NEXT QUESTION OR SUGGESTION. WHICH FOLLOWING THE BUDGETEERS ON PAGE. NINE A LIST OF POSSIBLE RESPONSES IN YOU'VE NOW CLARIFIED THAT THESE ARE ONES THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED VERSUS PRETEND. NECESSARILY THE LA YO'S WEIGHING IN AS TO WHAT THE LA -- FROM IN FROM A STANDING BACK PERSPECTIVE MIGHT ADVICE -- US TO PURSUEAS BEING MOST EFFECTIVE SO I WOULD I WOULD WELCOME THE ELLIE OWES RECOMMENDATIONS ON SOME OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS. THAT WE CAN USE OUR EXPENDITURES FIRST. TO RESPOND TO THE CURRENT HOMELESS POPULATION IN OTHER WORDS SHRINK IT. THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY HOMELESS. SECOND TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS. HOW DO WE KEEP CURTAIL THIS GROWTH? AND THIRD WHAT WOULD BE SOME OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE THINGS TO INCREASE THE HOUSING SUPPLY. AND WE KNOW VERY COMMONLY WE WE HERE -- SEE FOR REFORM OR HEAR THIS OR WE HEAR THAT. AND AGAIN WITHOUT GOOD DATA. WE COULD DIRECT OUR EFFORTS IN A WAY THAT YES COULD BRING US SOME BENEFIT BUT MAYBE NOT. A A SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT THAT IS RIGHT OUT THERE WE HAVEN'T WE JUST HAVEN'T. UNDERSTOOD YET. SO I THINK THOSE THINGS WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL. AND I KNOW THAT IN TERMS OF PREVENTING HOMELESSNESS -- THAT DATA THAT I'VE SEEN AND WOULD BE NICE TO POTENTIALLY HAVE COMPILED. IS THAT. HISTORICALLY STATES HAVE RELIED ON FEDERAL FUNDS FOR LOW INCOME HOUSING ASSISTANCE WHETHER IT SECTION EIGHT OR MORE MONIES MEAN MONIES FOR BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT HUD IS BEEN A VERY SIGNIFICANT SOURCE. BUT OVER THE LAST THIRTY TO FORTY YEARS ALLOCATION HAS SHRUNK SO DRAMATICALLY THAT FOR EXAMPLE. IN TERMS OF SECTION EIGHT THEIR SEARCH WHEN WE LOOK AT THE NEED FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE COMPARED TO THAT WHICH WE HAVE. IT'S SO DISPROPORTIONATE AND SO UNDERSTANDING BETTER. WHETHER THE STATE EXPANDING ITS PART OF RENTAL ASSISTANCE HOW SIGNIFICANT COULD THAT BE IN TERMS OF HELPING TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO US. AS WE WAIT THESE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU BOB FOR THE LIST IS TO EVERYONE KNOWS I'VE GOT SENATORS MORLOCK BAIL ROSTER RAZA WHITE HOUSE KEY AND REQUIRE CENTER MORE LOCK. MADAM CHAIR I SAID A FEW QUICK QUESTIONS -- SERVICE WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT ARE WE DOING WITH SB TO REVENUES WE PASS THAT LECTURE HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK TO AN ESCROW. ASSOCIATION THEIR SAMBOY WERE COLLECTED A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY. WHERE'S IT GOING SO HOW WHAT I ANSWER THAT QUESTION. YES SO I'M GONNA TURN THAT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE DANIELLE WHO'S RIGHT BACK THERE WHO SHOULD BE COMING UP BUT THESE REVENUES AS YOU KNOW IT WAS. PASSED BUT THEY'RE JUST BEGINNING TO COMMENT ACTUALLY RIGHT NOW SO THAT'S ACTUALLY A PUZZLE THAT WERE ACTIVELY WORKING ON GOOD MORNING DANIEL BRAND WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WE ARE JUST CALCULATE JUST RECEIVED THAT FULL FIRST YEARS WORTH OF REVENUES WERE STILL WORKING ON PLANNING TO DO THAT AND ACTUALLY -- I'M GONNA PASS THAT UP TO EACH CD YOU WHO IS PLANNED TO SPEAK AND THEN -- DURING THE GOVERNOR'S SPEECH LAST WEEK HE USED THE TERM NAVIGATION CENTERS. SO I'M I'M LOOKING AT PAGE SEVENTEEN OF OUR HANDS OUT AND ANOTHER. SHEET OF THE NUMBERS AT AND I'M NOT FINDING NAVIGATION CENTERS ANYWHERE DIED. DUE TO WHAT IS HE REFERRING TO SO THE NAVIGATION CENTERS AND DANIELLE CAN ELABORATE BUT THEY'RE BASICALLY SO THERE ARE HOMELESS SHELTERS THESE ARE EMERGING EMERGENCY SHELTERS AND EMERGENCY SITUATIONS. AND NAVIGATION CENTERS HAVE A SHELTER COMPONENT BUT ALSO HAVE SERVICES IN OTHER WAYS TO HELP PEOPLE NOT SIMPLY FOR THAT NIGHT BUT TRANSITION TO THE LONGER TERM SUPPORT THAT THEY MAY NEED AND THEN EVENTUALLY. GET THAT POSITIVE HOUSING EXIT WHICH IS WHAT WE ALL WANT SO THAT SPECIFIC CONCEPT IS WITHIN THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR HOMELESSNESS BUCKET. KATE THANK YOU. AND THEN -- YOU ALSO HAVE A AT LEAST AT LEAST SOME OF THREE YEARS I'M LOOKING AT FOR NO PLACE LIKE HOME -- ON THIS SHEET WHICH IS THAT THE PACKET SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU PROVIDED HERE. BUT IT HAS TWO HUNDRED SIXTY TWO MILLION. 417-182-62418 NINETEEN AND FOUR HUNDRED MILLION FOR NINETEEN TWENTY AND I'M. JUST WONDERING. WHAT THAT IS ABOUT? AND THE ANSWER TO THAT SO I THINK WE CAN GET BACK ON THAT -- SO AS YOU KNOW WITH NO PLACE LIKE HOME IT WAS ORIGINALLY BRING A BROADWAY FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT MONEY AND THEN THE BOND THAT PASSED LAST NOVEMBER. ENABLED THE STATE TO USE UP TO TWO BILLION DOLLARS SPECIFICALLY FOR HOUSING SO WE HAVE AS A GOAL IN OUR BUDGET TO ACCELERATE THE USE THAT MONEY FOR HOUSING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BUT TO MY KNOWLEDGE NONE OF THAT MONEY HAS. HAS GONE OUT THE DOOR JUST YET SO WE HAVEN'T EVEN SO WE ARE WE GOING THROUGH THE GRANT APPLICATION PROCESS RIGHT NOW. AND YOUR FRIEND IT AGAIN -- YES WE ARE CURRENTLY AYE WE HAVE I BELIEVE THE NO FAT OUT AND WE RECEIVE SOME APPLICATIONS -- CAM HDD CAN MAYBE SPEAK TO LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE SPECIFICS ON THAT BUT WE ARE IN THE PROCESS SUPPORTING THE FIRST ROUND OF FUNDING. KAY AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION IS ON SB TWO ZONES -- UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BEEN. REALLY FRUSTRATED WITH THAT RENO GOALS -- SO CONTENT TO LITIGATION I WON'T TALK ABOUT IT. NOTE. I WAS SENATOR OF BERGEN I SURE HUNTINGTON BEACH SO WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO WORK ON SOMETHING BUT EVEN THE READING GOALS. BABY COULD USE A LITTLE REFINING BECAUSE HUNTINGTON BEACH HAS RE NIGGLES OF LIKE THIRTEEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE UNITS IN THERE JUST FOR UNDER CHAI. BUT THE CITY NEXT DOOR FROM VALUE ONLY HAS EIGHTY SIX COSTA MESA. TO NEWPORT BEACH FIVE SO THERE'S SOMETHING KIND OF COULD BE I I THINK BUT WHERE MY FRUSTRATION HAS BEEN AS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR. IS WE'VE BEEN TOLD EACH CITY HAS TO ESTABLISH AN SP TWO ZONE WHICH IS WHERE YOU COULD PUT. A YEAR ROUND HOMELESS SHELTER USING TWO HUNDRED BEDS. SO THE CITY OF FULLERTON ESTABLISHES A LOCATION. I BUY A BUILDING. AND THE CITY GOES NUTS. AND THE COUNCIL VOTED DOWN. SANTA ANA SET UP IN SB TWO ZONE I BY BUILDING. OR BUT SHOULD BY AYE OPEN ESCROW. CITY GOES NUTS AND I HAVE TO PULL OUT OF ESCROW. SO. I'M. I'M JUST WONDERING AS AS THE GOVERNOR'S GETTING A LITTLE FIRMER. ABOUT RINA. HOW DO WE GET A LITTLE FIRMER FOR THE HOMELESS? WITH SB TWO ZONES BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S. DOING THE GENERAL PLANTS. IN THEIR IN THEIR A AND THEY'RE DOING THEM. BUT IGNORING NEMESIS CENTER NIELSEN KIND OF ALLUDED TO IT'S LIKE. SO SO YOU'RE HAPPY BECAUSE YOU KNOW. THE CITY HAS DONE THEIR GENERAL PLAN AND EVERYTHING'S FINE. AT LEAST HUNTINGTON BEACH WAS HONEST. AND SAID WE'RE CUTTING BACK. YOU KNOW TO WORK IN A DIFFERENT MODE -- BUT WE'RE GETTING CITIES THAT SAY YEAH WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS AND THEN DON'T. AND SO I'M I'M FRUSTRATED THEIR IS AS AN ADVOCATE FOR HOMELESSNESS. THAT ARE YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO END UP [inaudible] JUST SERVICE. SB TWOS SO I I JUST I I JUST PUT THAT OUT THERE FOR YET BECAUSE THIS WILL BE A MORE CRITICAL ONCE WE START [inaudible] ALLOCATING THESE -- THE SAYS. PROP TWO FUNDS SO. ABSOLUTELY IN TWO QUICK POINTS ON THAT FIRST IS ON ARENA HEADING THE MINISTRATION RECOGNIZES JUST LIKE YOU SAID THAT. IN THE PAST THESE GOALS HAVE NOT NECESSARILY REFLECTED REALITY AND SAID THAT SOMETHING THAT WILL BE A PRIORITY FOR H. C. D. -- BUILDING ON THE LEGISLATION THAT WILL BE PASSED LAST YEAR TO MAKE SURE THAT WITHOUT COMMENTING ON THE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES THAT YOU MENTIONED THAT SOME THESE DISPARITIES. THE DON'T SEEM TO REFLECT THE ACTUAL HOUSING NEEDS OF THAT JURISDICTION ARE CORRECTED OVERTIME SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT GOAL OF THE ADMINISTRATION. AND WHEN IT COMES MORE SPECIFICALLY TO THE PROBLEM THAT YOU MENTION AROUND HOMELESSNESS SHELTERS. THAT'S A REAL ISSUE AND THERE'S NO EASY ANSWER TO THAT AND TO SENATOR NIELSEN'S POINT. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN DRAFT YEAR OVER YEAR WHEN YOU FIND WORKING WE PUT THIS WILL WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR IT'S NOT GETTING APPROVED. STIRS NO GOOD ANSWER BUT I THINK ONE THING THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS NOT ONLY DOES HE TRY WITH THIS ONE TIME MONEY TO REWARD. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS FOR DOING THE RIGHT THING HE REALLY REWARDS REGIONAL COOPERATION BECAUSE TO YOUR POINT RIGHT THE COUNTY MIGHT WANT ONE THING AND THEN THE CITY MIGHT WANT TO VERY DIFFERENT BANKS AND THAT'S HOW THINGS GET PUSHED. INTO THE FUTURE AND SO WITH THIS POT OF MONEY AND THIS IS IN THE BUDGET YEAR WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS DEPENDING ON OUR FISCAL SITUATION IN THE YEARS AFTER THAT BUT IF THESE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS STEP UP WITH THIS. NOT ONLY WILL THEY GET THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT THEY NEED BUT THEY'LL ALSO GET SOME DECENT SENT A PAYMENT SO. IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM THAT YOUR THAT YOU BRING UP BUT IT'S AND GENTLE KNOWLEDGE TO HELP PEOPLE DO THE RIGHT THING THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU -- I HAD I HAD A LONG LIST OF CD BG R. HOUSING PUBLIC HOUSING ALL THE ALL THE PROGRAMS A GOT A LIMITED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR LAST DECADE OR SO. IF IT WAS IS A SOUNDING LIST OF PROGRAMS -- RELATED TO HOUSING HOMELESSNESS. OF FUNDING -- FOR PEOPLE THAT. WERE NEEDED RENT SUBSIDIES ALL THOSE THINGS WERE ELIMINATED -- AND THE LAST SAY DECADE OR OR BEYOND OUT SO WE ALL WE ALL KNOW THAT THE BURDEN HAS SHIFTED. TO THE STATE. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS INNOCENCE AND I THINK RIGHT NOW WE'RE KINDA HAVING A TROUBLE WITH DEVELOPING. DOUBT REALITY AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. TO HAVE A REAL SPECIFIC. PLAN ON HOUSING. OKAY THAT'S WHY YOU KNOW SO THAT'S KIND OF LIKE USED TO BE A OF FEDERAL THING. IS NO LONGER FEDERAL THING THEY ONLY WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN IT ANYMORE. OF ME THEY'RE VERY CLEAR. WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY -- IDEAS. COMING OUT ON THAT SUBJECT SO NOW IT'S SURE. TO AND IT'S NOW KIND OF MORE OUR RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT'S KIND OF LOOK WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE SO FOR ME -- I LOOK AT THIS AS SETTING SOME TARGETS HOW MANY YEARS YOU WANT TO BUILD YOU'RE WHO YOU WANT BUILDING. FOR AND HOW MUCH MONEY IS GOING TO COST. AND I THINK WE HAVE TO DO THAT SOME PEARLY SIMPLE ARITHMETIC. MINUS OF THE SUBJECT -- THE THE CAR SHARING BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE STATE GOVERNMENT HAS TO BE DEFINED WE HAVE TO SAY OKAY WE'RE GOING TO PUT IT X. AMOUNT. THEY HAVE TO PUT UP X. AMOUNT. WE HAVE TO IDENTIFY THAT WE HAD TO BE REAL SPECIFIC WITH IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SPECIFIC TARGETS OF NUMBER UNITS. WE HAVE TO SAY YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PUT UP MIX MOUNT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT OF X. AMOUNT [inaudible] NO. WE'VE ALREADY PUT A LOT OF EMPHASIS. IN -- TO OF STARTING UP. I WOULD SAY A HOUSING PROGRAM. BUT WE HAVEN'T IDENTIFIED YET. ON ON GOING SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR A MAJOR HOUSING PROGRAM FROM FROM THE STATE WE HAVE A LOT OF ONE TIME PROGRAMS HERE. THIS IS ONE TIME MONEY IS NT ONGOING MONEY IT'S LIKE THIS YEAR MAYBE NEXT YEAR WE HAVE BUDGET FROM IT'LL GO IT WILL IT'LL GO AWAY WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. SO I THINK WE ARE TODAY -- FIVE MORE OF AN ONGOING. SOURCE OF FUNDS THAT WE HAVE TO GO BACK IN AND ABLE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO HAVE AN ONGOING SOURCE OF FUNDS. THOSE ARE THE THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS IN GENERAL. OF I I WANTED TO MANAGER WANTED TO SAY. I THINK THAT THIS WAS A EXCELLENT REPORT WRITTEN BY THE STAFF OVER VIEWING THIS ISSUE. I WANTED TO CONGRATULATE THEM I ALSO WANT TO GRADUATE DAILY -- REPORT EXCELLENT VERY GOOD -- MY WAY OF THINKING IS THIS -- HOW MUCH SUBSIDY? DO WE DO WE HAVE TO HAVE TO GET THE VERY LOW. PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT GOING TO REALLY BE AIDED BY. SIR THIS TRICKLE DOWN HOUSING. THERE TOO LOW THERE TOO FAR DOWN. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE HELD BY ANY. TRICKLE DOWN OF MASSIVE CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM THAT WOULD THAT. CREATES -- MORE HOUSING THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE GONNA NEED THEY'RE ALWAYS GONNA NEED SOME CARS SUBS. SO WE HAVE TO IDENTIFY WHO THOSE PEOPLE ARE I'VE IDENTIFIED THEM AS THE VERY LOW AND LOW VERY LOW AND EXTREMELY LOW INCOME -- HOUSING A CHALLENGE PEOPLE HAT PAY OVER 50% OF THEIR INCOME FOR HOUSING THAT'S ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION HOUSEHOLDS. SO THOSE WHO THE PEOPLE IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THAT AND YOU WANT TO SAY HOW LONG YOU SHOULD WE WORK TO PROVIDE THEM HOUSING WE DID A TEN YEAR PLAN -- ONLY WE HAVE TO DO ABOUT A HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND UNITS HERE. BOOK THAT'S A LOT. SO -- HOW TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO IT HOW TO THE STATE GOVERNMENT'S DO IT WE'RE GONNAHAVE TO PUT UP? FIVE SIX BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. STE IT TOOK TO HOUSING PRODUCTION. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS GOING OUT TO PUT UP THREE THREE MAYBE FOUR BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR HOUSING CONSTRUCTION. OKAY SO WE HAVE TO HAVE LAWS THAT ENABLE THEM TO DO THAT I THINK THE ENHANCE INFRASTRUCTURE. FINANCING DISTRICT -- LAW IS A GOOD START. OF OF SAN WHICH DEDICATES 50% OF THE FUNDS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT'S ANOTHER START ALLOWING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- TO START RESTART SOME KIND OF COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT KIND OF PROGRAM -- THAT'S ANOTHER START OF BUT THE STATE GOVERNMENT'S GOING OUT. TO HAVE A STREAMLINED HOUSING PROGRAM I THINK ONE WAY WE CAN HELP HOUSING IS TO REDUCE FEES. OF SIR WHAT KOWSKI. HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO PUT ONE IN YOUR E. D. USE? IN FREMONT WHAT WHAT HOW MUCH VISA THEY'VE CHART IT WAS TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER DAY FOR A FIVE HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT -- ALTERNATE DWELLING UNIT PROJECT FOR TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY OF CHANGE THAT THERE'S AN ANNOYING SENATOR REPRESENTS. THE DATA BACK. THEY THEY HAVE ACTUALLY KICK UP AND DECIDED TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND NOT CHARGE NUMBER EIGHTY YOU SO SO SO MY POINT IS THE FEE THE FEE ISSUE HAS TO BE ADDRESSED. WE HAVE TO HAVE A POLICY. THAT. KEEPS LOCAL GOVERNMENT FROM SHE OVER CHARGING AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS. PROCESS REDRAWN KNOWS ALL THOSE KIND OF PROJECTS WE NEED A POLICY A LAW. THAT PROTECTS. THE THOSE ISSUE CENTER SKINNER HAD A HAD A PROPOSAL ON RENTS I THINK THOSE KINDS OF THINGS HELP -- PREVENT -- THE A GENTRIFICATION I'D LIKE I'D LIKE TO ASK DAILY -- FINALLY IF THEY COULD FIND OUT. OUR HOUSING STOCK. OF WE'RE LOOKING AT LIKE IT'S STATIC HERE. BUT WE'RE REALLY NEED TO KNOW IS HOW MANY UNITS HAVE GONE FROM AFFORDABLE. THE OF THE EXISTING HOUSING STOCK HOW MANY YEARS HAVE GONE FROM AFFORDABLE TO NON AFFORDABLE. DUE TO THE GENTRIFICATION OTHER KINDS OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES BECAUSE THAT'S A NEGATIVE. TO WHEN THE PRICES GO SO HIGH THAT PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD AND THEY HAVE TO MOVE OUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD THEY LIVE THEIR LIVES IN. BECAUSE THE RENTS ARE GONNA HI HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE AEAS LIKE THAT NEVER DISTRICT I DO. SO I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE THE THE TREND IN CALIFORNIA -- WHEN YOU HAVE THIS RESTRICTIVE SUPPLY? WE HAVE THIS JENNIFER CATION THAT ACTUALLY -- MAYBE DUE TO SOME GOVERNMENT POLICIES WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT GOVERNMENT POLICIES ENCOURAGE GENTRIFICATION. IN IN A NEGATIVE WAY IN TERMS OF PRICING OF HOUSE HOUSING FOR PEOPLE RENTS. AND I TAKE THOSE -- THOSE ISSUES HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED -- I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. AND THANK YOU MANAGER. ROB WHO'LL BE FOLLOWED BY CENTERS TO RISE SO WHY CAL SKI AND REQUIRE SONORA VENTURE OVER THE LAST. YEAR TO WE'VE. HAD SEVERAL BILLS PASSED THROUGH BOTH SENT IN THE ASSEMBLY SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. HAVING TO DO WITH OUR HOUSING PACKAGE ONE OF THEM WAS THE SENATE BILL FIVE FOUR ZERO WHICH HAD TO DO WITH HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES OWNS. WHICH ALLOWED CITIES AND COUNTIES TO COMBINE -- NONCONTIGUOUS PARCELS OF PROPERTY OVERLY WITH THIS BILL AND THEN [inaudible] APPROVED. FOR A RAPID SCHEDULE PROJECT PROPOSALS THAT ARE SUBMITTED TO COMPLY. OF THAT WHOLE PROCESS OF COURSE DEPENDS ON HAVING THE MONEY TO FUND THE PLANNING THIS SPECIFIC PLAN IN THE E. I. ARE -- IS THE IS THERE SOME PORTION OF THE SEVEN IF YOU'VE COVERED THIS JUST TELL ME SO AND I'LL. SHUT UP. BUT IS THERE SOME PORTION OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE HOUSING PLANNING AND PRODUCTION GRANT PEACE. ALLOCATED FOR THAT PLANNING PURPOSE FOR EXAMPLE THE SB. FIVE FOUR ZERO PLANNING PROCESS SO WE HAVEN'T MADE THAT SPECIFIC DETERMINATION YET IT SO WE KNOW THAT THE GOALS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND THE GOALS AND SB FIVE FORTY ARE VERY SIMILAR. AND WE ALSO KNOW AS YOU POINTED OUT FUNDING IS THE KEY ISSUE FOR THE LOANS AND WHERE IS IT GOING TO COME FROM. AND THAT SB TO FUNDING IS DANIELLE MENTIONED IS JUST COMING IN -- SO GIVEN THAT A LOT OF THESE PROGRAM FIND I THINK EIGHT CD IN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS AND MONTHS WE'LL BE TAKING THE LEAD IN DEVELOPING GUIDELINES FOR HOW THAT WILL BE FUNDED SO TENSE YOUR QUESTION IT'S NOT IN OUR BUDGET. RIGHT NOW BUT IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THANK YOU AND THEN ONE FINAL QUESTION ARE ONE SECOND QUESTION IN MY FINAL ONE HAS TO DO WITH A MENTAL HEALTH. TRANSITIONAL IN SUPPORT OF SERVICES FUNDING AS OPPOSED TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITIES. TO HOUSE THOSE WHO ARE -- HOMELESS -- WHAT? I HAVE I'M LOOKING AT THIS LIST OF THAT WE HAVE ANYWHERE OUR PACKET HAVING TO DO WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS FUNDING VARIOUS -- APPROPRIATIONS IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND TWENTY AND I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH PIECE OF THIS DEALS WITH SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. IS IT IS IT THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION FOR A WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS HOUSING INVESTMENT. THE PROJECT ASSISTANCE IN THE TRANSITION FROM HOMELESSNESS IT'S ABOUT NINE MILLION. SO I WOULD SAY WITHIN THE HOUSING LIST OF ITEMS THAT YOU HAVE TO KEEP PORTIONS ARE NUMBER ONE THAT ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR A WHOLE CREEK PERSON CARE PILOTS. AND SECOND AND WHILE NOT DIRECTLY THERE IS OFTEN AN OVERLAP FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE APPLYING FOR SSI WERE ELIGIBLE BUT ARE NOT CURRENTLY RECEIVING SSI THERE IS AN OVERLAP THERE OFTEN WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING MENTAL. HEALTH CONDITIONS SO THOSE ARE THE TWO IN OUR BUDGET BETTER SPECIFICALLY TIED TO HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS AND THEN OF COURSE THERE ARE OTHER PORTIONS OF OUR BUDGET. THAT DEAL WITH MENTAL HEALTH MORE BROADWAY AND THAT INCLUDES OUR NEW MONEY FOR EARLY INTERVENTION FOR EARLY PSYCHOSIS DETECTION. AND ALSO INCLUDES -- THE CHANGES THAT WERE MAKING TO OUR AYE HSS PROGRAM INCLUDING RE BENCHING THE COUNTY MOE ACTUALLY FREES UP MONEY FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AT THE COUNTY LEVEL SO THAT SHOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE ACROSS THE STATE. SINCE IT'S ALL RIGHT FOOD RELATED I MEAN MY LISTEN GIVING THEM A LEG UP AND MOVING ON I I ASSUME WE'LL DO THIS IN THIS AT THE SUBCOMMITTEE LEVEL DOCTOR PAN AND HIS GROUP -- AND SO ALL RELY ON THEM WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE SORT OF A A TOTAL LOOK AT WHAT OUR TOTAL MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING PIECES AND HOW IT ALL SORT OF RELATES BUT AGAIN I'LL LEAVE THAT TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE. MANAGER APPRECIATE YOU PATIENCE SIR I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE. THANK YOU CENTER DORADO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- THE SHORT QUESTION -- BUT IT'S RELATED TO WHAT SENATOR NIELSEN HAD RAISED. ON SOMEONE OTHERS HAD. OF SAID ABOUT ONGOING SOURCES OF FUNDING -- THESE TO BE THE COMMUNITY REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES IN THE STATE WHICH WERE ELIMINATED. AND I KNOW THAT THERE WERE. SOME THAT DIDN'T WORK AT ALL SOME THAT WORKED. REALLY WELL IN SOME THAT KIND OF WORK BUT IN LOS ANGELES IT AT LEAST KIND OF WORK BECAUSE THAT WAS A STEADY. IT WAS A SOURCE OF CONTINUE WITH -- HOUSING. THAT WAS -- THAT'S HOW IT WAS DONE RIGHT WE WE ALWAYS KNEW THERE WAS AN AGENCY THAT WAS CONTINUOUSLY MOVING AND AND MAKING SURE THAT HOUSING WAS BUILT. WITH THERE WAS ENOUGH FOR WAS AND IS ANOTHER QUESTION SO. I GUESS BUT TO TO WHAT THE EARLIER QUESTION WAS DO WE KNOW. HOW MUCH AND HOW WELL THOSE SERIES? WORKED TO BE A CONTINUOUS SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR HOUSING -- BECAUSE WE THREW THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATH WATER HERE AND JUST IT WAS ALL ELIMINATED WITHOUT HAVING ANY ANALYSIS. OF WHERE IT WAS DOING GOOD AND WHY IT WAS DOING GOOD BUT IT CERTAINLY WAS A LOCAL SOURCE OF FUNDING. REGULAR SOURCE OF FUNDING SO DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON THAT. THE ALL MAKE ONE OR TWO KEY POINTS AND THEN DANIELLE OR LA I MIGHT WANT TO WEIGH IN AS WELL I THINK THE FIRST IS. AS YOU MENTIONED YOU NOT ONLY WAS A DIFFERENT PROGRAM BUT IT WAS ELIMINATED A VERY DIFFERENT TIME FOR THE STATE EVEN THOUGH WASN'T THAT LONG AGO. AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT YOU KNOW WE IT WORKS -- THE REASON THE GOVERNOR FOCUSED ON THE I. S. D.'S IS HE VIEWED THIS AS A WAY. TO CONTINUE TO HARMONIZE YOU GET YOUR SECTIONS WORKING TOGETHER WHICH WAS A KEY GOAL OF THAT PROGRAM THAT WAS ELIMINATED. BUT AT THE SAME TIME RAIN AND SOME OF THE EXCESSES OR THE FACT THAT THIS WOULD BE MONEY THAT WOULD OTHERWISE GO TO SCHOOLS AND HERE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE. PROBLEMS WERE CORRECTED FOR BUT YOU ARE RIGHT THAT WHEN IT COMES TO AN ONGOING SOURCE OF FUNDING WE HAVE SP TWO WHICH IS A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. WE HAVE THE FOUR BILLION DOLLAR HOUSING BONDS WHERE HE BOND MONEY WILL HOPEFULLY START FLOWING THIS YEAR THAT WE HAVE NO PLACE LIKE HOME FUNDING -- BUT WHEN IT COMES TO A BROADER ON GOING FUNDING SOURCE -- THAT'S REALLY A BUDGETARY CHALLENGE BECAUSE I CERTAINLY THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD LOOK FAVORABLY ON IT'S JUST A MATTER OF WHERE THE MONEY IS COMING FROM AND WHEN IT CAME TO THOSE. REYES AND REDEVELOPMENT NO THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ELIMINATED IN A BUDGET CRISIS AND AS MENTIONED IT REALLY. IN SOME WAYS TOOK MONEY FROM THE SCHOOL SHARE THAT WAS DONE BACK FILLED BY THE STATE AND THAT WAS MONEY THAT THE STATE. COULD AND THEN SPEND ON OTHER PRIORITIES -- SO CERTAINLY THAT'S A CONVERSATION WE WANT TO HAVE WITH YOU YOU KNOW WE I THINK WE SHARE A LOT OF THE SAME GOALS IT'S JUST A MATTER ESPECIALLY AS A FINANCE. THINKING WHERE IS THAT ONGOING MONEY COMING FROM. AND JUST A COMMENT -- I KNOW YOU MADE TO REFORM SUCH AS OR SPORTSVENUES -- I WAS INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN THE VERY FIRST -- PULLS ALL THAT INVOLVED A SPORTS VENUE. AND I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WHAT WE DID WAS TO NEGOTIATE A VERY BROAD VERY INCLUSIVE GRASSROOTS COMMUNITY BENEFITS AGREEMENT. SO WHILE IT'S REFERRED TO AS DOING A FAVOR FOR BILLIONAIRES THAT -- ONE WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE MODEL FOR SUBSEQUENT -- YOU KNOW SEQUEL -- SORT OF REFORM TYPE OF PROJECTS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MODELED ALL THE WAY THROUGH. AND ALL THE WAY THROUGH MEANT THAT THERE WERE MANY ISSUES IN THE COMMUNITY THAT WERE GIVEN IN EXCHANGE FOR THE VALUE. OF HAVING -- A CHANGED ONE PIECE OF THE SUPER PROCESS THAT DIDN'T ELIMINATED ALTOGETHER BUT I JUST THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T JUST SORT OF THROW EVERYTHING INTO ONE CATEGORY. BUT JUST LOOK AT WHAT THE VALUE WAS AND THE EFFORT THAT WAS PUT INTO -- SEEK WAS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. AND THERE ARE WAYS OF DOING THAT THAT DOESN'T HARM ANY COMMUNITY WE HAD A VERY BROAD INCLUDING BUYER MENTALIST COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS WHO ALL AGREED. AND IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT SO I JUST THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO OTHERWISE IT BECOMES ARE YOU PRO OR AGAINST SEE PLUS. AND THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT SHOULD AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL YOUR Q. -- SENATE DRUGS OF CENTER WHAT CASCADE. MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN JOSE TALKS ABOUT SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS WE'VE ALL BEEN TALKING ABOUT TO SEND PROBLEMS. DOESN'T JUST GO BACK TO THE FISCAL STATION OF OF LAND USE MEAN WE'RE WE'RE SITTING HERE TELLING CITIES THAT THEY HAVE TO DO THIS AND WE DON'T GIVE THEM THE ECONOMIC MEANS THE REASON THEY HAVE AUTO MALL SAYS BECAUSE OR ALMOST AS BECAUSE THE PROP. THIRTEEN AND AND I WANT TO ASK DAILY -- AND AND THE FINANCE YOU KNOW. MY COLLEAGUES TO EACH SIDE OF ME HAVE PROP SIXTY TWO IMPROPER TO EIGHTEEN WHICH TAKES CARE GENERAL LAW GENERAL TAX INCREASES IMPARTIAL TEXAS TO ALL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS SPECIAL TAXES. ON PROP THIRTEEN WHICH SEEMS TO BE WHAT EVERYBODY'S DANCING AROUND HIS HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING WHY IS IT A BAD IDEA NOT TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION. THE REPEAL OF PROP. THIRTEEN SO THAT WOULD BE DISCUSSION. SO I THINK -- I WILL SAY IT IS JUST WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS SAID WHICH IS THAT HE IS OPEN TO A DISCUSSION. ON TAX REFORM AND WE ALL KNOW THERE IS AN INITIATIVE THAT HAS ALREADY QUALIFIED FOR THE BALLOT IN -- TWENTY TWENTY AND CERTAINLY THAT CONVERSATION BOTH THISYEAR AND NEXT YEAR. ESPECIALLY GIVEN CHANGES TO THE PROPOSITION PROCESS NOW INVOLVING THE LEGISLATURE AS WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT YEARS -- THAT CERTAINLY DISCUSSION THAT'S COMING AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION ARE OPEN TO HEARING ALL PERSPECTIVES ON THAT. WOULDN'T WITH ALEJO DON'T WE JUST RETURNED TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE DECISIONS WE ACTUALLY DON'T RAISE THE ASSESSED VALUE OR CREATE SPECIAL TAXES WE JUST GET THE AUTHORITY BACK TO THEM. WELL SO THERE SHOULD ONLY CONCERN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THAT ACCOMMODATING YOU HOUSING AND THEREFORE YOU PEOPLE WILL NOT RAISE ENOUGH REVENUE TO COVER THE ADDITIONAL SERVICES THAT THOSE RESIDENTS WOULD NEED. AND SO ALL THREE OF THE ALLOCATION OF LOCAL TAXES -- COULD HELP SO THAT YOU GET A THE NEW SERVICES NEEDED ASK NEW HOUSING COMES AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF WAYS THAT THAT CAN BE DONE -- ONE OPTION IS TO ALLOCATE FUTURE TAX REVENUE GROWTH IN A WAY THAT'S REFLECTIVE OF OF POPULATION GROWTH AND AND HOUSING BUILDING -- WHILE THESE CHANGES ARE CERTAINLY WORTHWHILE AND AND MERIT CONSIDERATION THERE'S ABSOLUTELY HURDLES TO THAT AS WELL THERE'S SOME CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITS THAT WOULD NEED TO BE ADDRESSED ON HOW THESE ALLOCATIONS HAPPEN -- THERE'S ALSO CLEARLY IT WOULD BE SOME LOCAL PUSH BACK BECAUSE ANY REALLOCATION WOOD RIDGE NATURALLY RESULT IN NEW WINNERS AND LOSERS AND THERE CAN BE SOME CONCERN THAT. SOME COMMUNITIES WOULD NOT FARE WELL IN THAT PROCESS OF THERE'S DIFFICULT DISCUSSIONS BUT IT COULD CERTAINLY LEAD TO MEANINGFUL CHANGES IN THE SPACE. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE IS -- THAT THE IMPACT FEES FOR NEW HOMES AT LEAST IN IN MY COMMUNITY -- NOW HAVE BROKEN THE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AREA AND WE CAN SIT HERE AND DANCE AROUND IN STATE AND SAY THINGS MY QUESTION. IS ON THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THAT WE'RE GIVING TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS I HAVE A AN INTEREST IN EIGHTY USE WE PASSED ALONG TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THAT SAID IF YOU DON'T COMPLY WITH STATE LAW YOUR YOUR YOUR LOCAL ORDINANCES ARE FALLING NóI. NOT TWO HUNDRED CITIES OF ACTUALLY PASSED NEW EIGHTY USE LAWS BUT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY HAVE NOT NOW SOME OF THEM ARE COMPLYING WITH STATE LAW AND I APPLAUD THEM BUT A WHOLE BUNCH OF THEM. NOT TO POINT OUT ANYONE'S REPRESENTED ON THIS PAGE HE USES TO JUST TO MOST TO BE DOING WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING TO TO HELP US MEET OUR HOUSING TARGETS. ARE THEY GONNA BE LIMITATIONS ON THEM TO JUST COMPLY WITH STATE LAW. SO WE HAVE A DEMONSTRATION IS STILL PUTTING TOGETHER AND BE TRAILER BILL FOR CONSIDERATION TO THE LEGISLATURE BUT WE ARE TRYING TO INCENTIVIZE PRODUCTION THAT WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED IN THE ABSENCE OF THIS MONEY. THAT IS THE GOAL. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DETAILS. THANK YOU US AND WE CAN SEND REQUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR -- PLACE LIKE HOME AND THE I JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT AND IF IT'S OKAY MISTER CHAIR TO BE ABLE. TO TALK ON MISTER MOORE LAST QUESTION I WANNA TAKE ONE TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE GOOD FOLKS EIGHT CD IS THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS ARE ALREADY MOVED SELF SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND A HUNDRED THOUSAND TO HELP. COMMUNITIES PLAN FOR THOSE PERMANENT HOUSING SO THEY ARE ON IT AND JUST VERY VERY GRATEFUL ON THAT. JUST TALKING ABOUT -- OPPORTUNITIESOWN SYNTAX CONFORMITY TO SOME CONCERNS WANT TO BE ABLE TO FLAG BOTH -- FOR OBVIOUSLY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA L. IN A SENATE BUDGET STAFF. IF THE STATE MOOSE ATTACKS CONFORMITY AN OPPORTUNITY ZONES -- CONFORMING WITH WHAT FEDERAL LAW IS. BUSINESSES THAT WOULD BE LOCATED WITHIN A NEW OPPORTUNITIES ON CITY CALIFORNIA WOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY ANY GAME ON THEIR TAXES. TO TWENTY FORTY SEVEN AND THAT'S A HUGE CONCERN AND GIVE WAY. TO LARGE CORPORATIONS -- AND WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION'S CURRENTLY LOOKING AT IS GREEN BUSINESS ON N PARAPHRASING HERE GREEN TECHNOLOGIES WELT AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH IS. VERY BROAD. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE HYPER FOCUSED ON THE DETAILS IF FOR MOVING TOWARDS OPPORTUNITIESOWNS. AND TAX CONFORMITY ON WHAT THAT WILL MEAN FOR THE STATE OUR COFFERS -- AS WELL AS WHAT OUTCOMES THAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE ME TO BE VERY SPECIFIC -- AND NOT BROAD BECAUSE AS WE'VE SEEN MULTIPLE PRESS REPORTS ON EVEN MEMBERS OF THE CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL MINISTRATIONS FAMILY HAD BEEN ABLE TO TAKE. ARE CONSIDERED -- OPPORTUNITY -- AND GAIN FROM OPPORTUNITIES OWNS AN INCREASE IN ON THE FEDERAL SIDE EDISON KNOW IF THERE'S BEEN EXPLORATIONS ON THIS BECAUSE I HAVE SOME CONCERN ON THAT. ABSOLUTELY SO I THINK ON MAKE TWO POINTS IN AND THIS IS AN ONGOING CONVERSATION THE FIRST IS THAT -- ON THIS PROPOSAL AS WELL WE'RE STILL FINALIZING THE DETAILS BECAUSE AS YOU SAID IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S VERY COMPLICATED IT'S NEW THERE ARE A LOT OF MOVING PARTS. AND WE IN PARTICULAR WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO PROJECTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY VALUABLE AND TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE BITS INCENTIVIZING INVESTMENT WITHIN CALIFORNIA. SITTING ONE THING THAT'S DIFFERENT OUR INTERPRET THEY DON'T NECESSARILY RECEIVE ANY TAX BREAK IT'S THE INVESTORS IN THOSE PROJECTS SO I THINK THE INITIAL GOAL OF THE FEDERAL PROGRAMS IS TO GET MORE MONEY INTO THESE. DISTRICTS WHERE THE MONEY OTHERWISE WOULD NOT GO AND THEN GIVE THOSE INVESTORS SOME TYPE OF BREAK ON ANY CAPITAL GAINS THAT A CREW -- I WILL SAY I THINK ARE GOVERNED FIVE STAFF HAVE A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION ON THAT -- AS THEY ARE NOT PAINTING FEDERAL TAX IN THE NEW GAINES ON THAT BASE WHEN THE OPPORTUNITIES OWNERS CREATED SO WOULD LOVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON THAT BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S THAT'S CORRECT FOR THE INVESTOR THAT IS CORRECT GAINED. IN THAT IS A POTENTIAL HUGE HIT TO WHAT WOULD BE OUR STATE BUDGET IF WE'RE GONNA BE CONFORMING YES YES AND SO CERTAINLY AND ESPECIALLY WHAT WE DO AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WERE VERY WARY OF ANY -- ANY POLICIES THAT MIGHT AFFECT THE GENERAL FUND IN A NEGATIVE WAY SO AS PART OF OUR TAX CONFIRM THE PACKAGE WE'RE DOING OUR MODELING AND TAKING A HARD LOOK AT WHETHER. WHAT THE REVENUE IMPACT WILL BE AND WHETHER THOSE PROJECTS WILL BE BENEFICIAL AND I THINK THE SECOND THING TO YOUR POINT IS THIS QUESTION OF MORE YOU KNOW HOW WILL HOW WILL THIS BE DETERMINES OPPORTUNITY ZONES OF ALREADY BEEN ESTABLISHED UNITS AT? FEDERAL STATE DETERMINATION -- BUT THE THE FEEDBACK THAT WE'VE BEEN GETTING IS THE I'D LIKE YOU SAID IT CAN BE HARD THIS IS A PRETTY BROAD CATEGORY SO WE'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO STRUCTURE WHAT TYPES OF INVESTMENTS ARE ELIGIBLE BUT BY ANY DEFINITION. IT'S GOING TO BE BROAD SO THE REASON IT'S PART OF OUR CONFORMITY PACKAGES WE TO THINK. THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK OUT FOR BUT THERE IS A POSITIVE ELEMENT TO THEM ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU PAIR THEM WITH THE IRAQIS. THIS COULD ACTUALLY THE GOVERNOR SAID TRANSPORTATION IS HOUSING THE FACT THIS IS NEW AND THERE IS A LOT THAT WE NEED TO WATCH OUT. FOR AGAIN I THINK THAT -- THE NARROWER NARROW THE FOCUS THE BETTER -- AND IF OUR GOAL IS TO CREATE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE NEED TO BE ADDED TO FIND AT ON AND WHERE ARE. DEFICIT IS AT BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IS ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION AFFORDABLE UNITS IN THE VERY LOW LOW AND MODERATE CATEGORIES. SO IF THAT IS GOING TO BE A FOCUS BECAUSE WHAT WE CONTINUE TO HEAR AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF ANYONE THINKS I'M WRONG. IS THAT MARKET RATE DEVELOPERS ARE UNABLE. TO BUILD UNITS WITHIN THOSE THREE CATEGORIES BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST OF CONSTRUCTION. SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IT THIS IS A ROAD THAT WE'RE GONNA GO DOWN. IT'S GOING TO BE FOCUSED. AND NOT A GIVEAWAY. AND NOT CAN IMPACT OUR STATE COFFERS AND RIGHT NOW. ST AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN GREEN TECHNOLOGY VERY BROAD AND I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT IS FOR THE FLAG THAT BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S SOME HUGE RAMIFICATIONS AS WE MOVE FOR THAT ON IF WE'RE GONNA CONFORM TO WHAT THE CURRENT FEDERAL DEFINITION IS. YES THAT'LL JUST MAKE ONE POINT IN THAT IN THE INTEREST THIS OUT BUT ONE THING THAT WE ALSO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION FINANCING OF WE'VE SET OUT OUR GOALS. FOR MAKING GET MAKING THIS CHANG TO OUR TAX CODE WHICH WOULD COST THE STATE MONEY AND THOSE GOALS ARE VERY SIMILAR TO YOURS. THAT YOU MENTIONED ARE VERY ALIGNED AT THE SAME TIME I THINK ONE THING THAT WE THINK A LOT ABOUT IS THE SIMPLICITY OF THE TAX CODE AND OF COURSE THE TAX CODE IS VERY COMPLICATED ALWAYS. AND ALWAYS WILL BE -- BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN YOU KNOW IT CAN BE HARD TO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE A TRANSPORTATIONPROJECTS. IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY FOLLOW FALL INTO HOUSING WORE GREEN JOBS BUT IF IT'S AN INFILL TRANSPORTATION PROJECT IT COULD HELP BOTH OF THOSE THINGS. SO FOR THE PURPOSES OF SIMPLICITY YOU KNOW WE'RE THINKING ABOUT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO BE MAKING THOSE DETERMINATIONS OR DO WE CONFORM ON A BROADER SET OF CATEGORIES LIKE YOU MENTIONED THE PROPOSAL SOUNDS LIKE RIGHT NOW. BUT IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL EMPHASIS OF GOVERNMENT ARE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STEERING INVESTORS AND HIGHLIGHTING PROJECTS TO GO IN THE CATEGORIES THAT YOU OUTLINED IN. THE CONVERSATION TO BE CONTINUED ON THE ISSUE OF INCENTIVES -- THE STATE DOESN'T. ALWAYS AT HAS NOT ALWAYS HAD THE BEST TRACK RECORD. I'M GETTING ADDITIONAL AFFORDABLE UNITS BUILT WHEN IT COMES TO INCENTIVES -- AND WHAT HS ENDED UP HAPPENING IN YEARS PAST AYE AND WOULD LOOK pTO BE A BE ABLE TO VERIFY THIS AS WELL. IS THAT WHAT IS INDEED UP HALFPENNIES ONLY INCENTIVIZE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BUILD ITS PROJECTS THAT ARE ALREADY IN THE PIPELINE AND BEEN APPROVED. AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO FIND NEW UNITS ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT IS CURRENTLY IN THE PIPELINE AND OR HAS BEEN APPROVED. BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND I THINK THAT'S TOUGH ON AND WANTED TO MAKE SURE IF WE'RE GOING DOWN THAT ROAD LEARN FROM THOSE MISTAKES BECAUSE THERE OF MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IN THE PAST WE'VE ENDED UP SPENDING HUNDREDS IF NOT OVER A BILLION DOLLARS ON MOSTLY. PRE APPROVED PROJECTS BUT NO PROJECTS THAT ARE NEW BECAUSE THEN CENTER PROGRAM. SO I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS IN ON THE LAST ITEM ME AND IN MADAM CHAIR. IS ON A PERMANENT SOURCE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. LOOK WE HAVE -- ELEVEN TO TWELVE BILLION MOVING OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS IN THE STATE. IN WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS COMMITMENT -- CENTER BELL IN THIS ENTIRE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR COMMITMENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT SOMETHING ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE INTERNET LINES COMING IN WHICH IS FANTASTIC. TO BE A TO MAKE A DENT -- I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WERE SOME ABUSES IN RDA IN THE PAST THANK WE NEED WE ARE LEARN FROM THOSE MISTAKES. PUT SOME TIGHT -- PARAMETERS AROUND. WHAT WE WANT TO BE DOING THIS TO BE A BE ABLE TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING? AND AT A MINIMUM PUT A TEN TO TWENTY YEAR TIME FRAME SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY GET THESE UNITS BUILT. BECAUSE AGAIN I THINK WHAT WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO RUN INTO OUR DEVELOPERS COMING TO US AND SAYING THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO BUILD WITHIN THOSE THREE CATEGORIES. VERY LOW LOW AND MOD WITHOUT HAVING A PERMANENT SOURCE. AS YOU KNOW IF THERE'S ANY FEEDBACK ON THAT. SO RIGHT NOW THAT SOMETHING FINDING I'M GOING MONEY IS IS ALWAYS A CHALLENGE SO WE WILL CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE'RE CONSTANTLY MONITORING THE BUDGET AND ONCE REVENUES COMING IN APRIL WILL HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHERE THINGS ARE. THANK YOU SO MUCH APPRECIATED THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR STONE'S FOLLOWED BY SENATOR LEYVA SENATOR STONE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IN THE THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN FOR THE FOR THE PRESENTATION NOT JUST A FEW BRIEF COMMENTS AND SOME QUESTIONS -- AND IT OPENS. PRIOR TO THE ABOLITION OF RDA -- BIG ABOARD SUPERVISOR AND AND A CITY COUNCIL WE DIDN'T HAVE THE HOUSING EMERGENCIES THAT WE HAVE TODAY. AND THAT WAS AN ON GOING REVENUE STREAM OR 20% HAD TO BE SET ASIDE. FOR LOW TO MODERATE INCOME HOUSING AND SO I COUNTY WE WE DID A GOOD JOB OF PROVIDING GET AND WHEN THAT FUNDING SOURCE STOPPED -- THAT'S WHEN RAN INTO PROBLEMS. IN ADDITION TO THAT -- THE COST OF BUILDING TODAY AND THE COST OF GETTING THROUGH MUNICIPALITIES. IS CHALLENGING BECAUSE WE IN THE LEGISLATURE KEEP ADDING MORE REQUIREMENTS. AND MAKING ANOTHER INSPECTION ANOTHER MANDATE -- MORE EXPENSIVE FOR DEVELOPERS TO PROVIDE THE AMERICAN DREAM OF HOMEOWNERSHIP. TO CALIFORNIANS. SO OUT FIRST TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AGAINST COULD SEE YOU AGAIN SIR -- THE THREE BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE FOR THE HOUSING HOMELESSNESS IS A ONE TIME -- ALLOCATION CORRECT ONE TIME MONEY TO BILLING -- ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLAR OKAY. SO ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS SO BASED ON ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PER DOOR. WHICH IS PROBABLY WHAT IT COST TO BUILD. AFFORDABLE HOUSING LOOK AT ABOUT TEN THOUSAND UNITS FIFTY THOUSAND UNITS BUT WE'RE LIKE A MILLION UNITS. UNDER WATER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I'M I DON'T YOU MISTER BUT I DO APPRECIATE -- THE EFFORT -- BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO MORE -- THAN THAT. AND WHILE I A APPRECIATE MY COMMENTS FROM MY FRIEND SENATOR Y. KASKI ABOUT PROP. THIRTEEN MAYBE CONSTITUENTS IN THE COASTAL COMMUNITIES CAN. HAVE THEIR ASSESSED VALUES THAT PRESENT A MARKET THAT RATHER THAN THEIR BASE BUT PROP THIRTEEN PROTECTIONS BUT I'LL TELL YOU THAT. AND MY DISTRICT AND IN MANY INLAND COUNTIES -- THE BIG FEARS THE ABOLITION OF A PROP THIRTEEN AND IT WILL TAKE SO MANY -- A GERIATRIC OLDER CALIFORNIANS THAT ONE LIVE IN THEIR HOMES IT'LL FORCE THEM OUT OF THEIR HOMES. IT'LL FORCE MANY MIDDLE CLASS BLUE COLLAR WORKERS IN MY DISTRICT THE LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK IT WILL FORCE THEM OUT OF THEIR HOMES AND WE MAY BE. EXACERBATING OF THE HOMELESS CRISIS -- WITH THAT AND I JUST STARTED OUT AS A A WARNING -- THAT -- THE CITIZENS ARE ALREADY NERVOUS ABOUT HI PROPOSITIONS ON THE BALLOT IN TWENTY TWENTY BUT MY QUESTION TO YOU SIR. IS SURPLUS PROPERTY SO THE GOVERNOR SAID HE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURPLUS PROPERTY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AVAILABLE -- FOR A LOT LOW INCOME HOUSING -- HAS THE ADMINISTRATION DONE AN INVENTORY OF THAT SURPLUS PROPERTY IS IT PUBLISHED IS IT AND HOW WILL MUNICIPALITIES TO BE ABLE. TO APPLY TO ACQUIRE THAT LAND AND AS HAS RULE MAKING BEEN DONE AS TO HOW THOSE PROPERTIES CAN AND WILL BE DEVELOPED. YES SO. ON THE QUEUE QUICK POINTS -- THE FIRST IS ON THE POINT THAT YOU RAISED AT THE BEGINNING WHICH I THINK IS SOMETHING THE ADMINISTRATION REALLY AGREES WITH IS THAT. NUMBER ONE WE'D LIKE TO FIND EVEN MORE SOURCES OF MONEY BUT NUMBER TO THE POINT THAT YOU'RE MAKING IS. THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO SPEND OURSELVES OUT OF WITH MONEY ALONE AND S I THINK ONE PREMISE BEHIND THE GOVERNOR'S PACKAGES THIS TAKES LOCAL RULE CHANGES IN ZONING CHANGES. AND PERMITTING CHANGES AND EVEN ALL THIS TOGETHER MAY NOT AMOUNT TO THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM THE FIRST YEAR TO BUT WE'RE HOPING. THAT DOES THINGS THAT MAY NOT CAUGHT THERE JUST AS THE BUDGET. THAT CAN ACTUALLY MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE AND SOLVING THE ISSUE BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT IF YOU TAKE. EVEN IF YOU MULTIPLY BY A BIG FACTOR ARE SPENDING ANY DIVIDED IT BY THE PER UNIT COST IT STILL DOESN'T GET TO WHERE CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO BE EVEN ON AN ANNUAL BASIS -- AND THEN SECOND -- AND YOU CAN ASK A QUESTION ABOUT PROPERTY RIGHTS I'M GONNA MOVE ON FROM THAT. AND I'M APPROACH YOU TODAY. WHEN IT COMES TO SURPLUS PROPERTY SO THE GOVERNOR'S AT ISSUES EXECUTIVE ORDER SO THE STATE IS IN THE PROCESS OF? PUTTING TOGETHER THAT LIST RIGHT NOW -- ONCE WE HAVE THAT WAS THAT'S WHEN WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH ONE OF THE RULES AND PROCESSES FOR WHAT TO DO NEXT BUT THE WAY WERE THINKING YOU KNOW JUST TO SHARE OUR THINKING OF IT RIGHT NOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS THAT. WE WOULD HAVE THAT LIST AND THEN WE CAN PUT THOSE OUT FOR EITHER BATES ENOUGH FOR DEVELOPERS WERE WILLING TO FOLLOW THE RULES IN TERMS OF UNITS THAT ARE AFFORDABLE OR IF THERE IS A LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THAT IS WILLING TO STEP UP AND THERE ARE NECESSARILY ANY OTHER PARTIES WE COULD ACTUALLY TRANSFER THE LAND TO THEM PERHAPS EVEN FOR A NOMINAL FEE DEPENDING ON WHAT THEY'RE PROPOSING -- AND THEN THEY CAN START BUILDING UP PRETTY QUICKLY AFTER HAT HAVE YOU THOUGHT AS AS YOU OFFER THOSE PROPERTIES TO MUNICIPALITIES HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF MAKING A NEXUS TO FEE REDUCTIONS. A PART OF THAT PACKAGE IN THAT BID PROCESS TO ACQUIRE THAT LAND BASICALLY FOR NOTHING. AT CENTER THAT'S A GOOD BECAUSE WE HAD BASICALLY BEEN FOCUSING ON THE LAND ITSELF YEAH TERMS OF INCENTIVES THAT'S THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD IDEA WE WILL TAKE AYE AYE THROUGH A VERY A BALL OUT THERE BECAUSE YOU GIVEN THE LAND FOR FREE THE THE THE FOR USER ANOTHER. COMPONENT THAT WE NEED TO LORD HOPEFULLY -- YOU'LL I WAS AT THIS STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS AND AND AND I WILL HEARD THE THE GOVERNOR'S -- CLAIM THAT YOU KNOW WE NEED SOME SEQUEL REFORMS WHEN IT COMES TO A PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. HOW SERIOUS IS THE GOVERNOR IT IS HE IS HE WILLING TO SIGN A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT IS GOING TO SEEK WITH STREAMLINED NOT? ELIMINATES EQUIPMENT SEQUENCE STREAMLINED AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO WE CAN GET HOUSING ON THE MARKET FASTER. SO WHAT FROM WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHEN IT COMES TO THE HOMELESSNESS PROPOSAL -- THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WITH SENATOR TO RISE OUT. THERE WE'VE DONE A LITTLE BIT MORE THINKING AND EVENTUALLY WILL PUT OUT OUR BILL WHEN IT COMES TO THE BROADER HOUSING PACKAGE I THINK IN THIS ADMINISTRATION STONE YOU I THINK WE'RE ABOUT FORTY FORTY FIVE DAYS AND SO -- THE GOVERNOR HAS NOT COMMITTED TO A SPECIFIC PACKAGE THERE YET OKAY WILL BE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT -- AND THEN WITH -- REGARD TO PROVIDING HOUSING. FOR HOMELESS THE HOMELESS POPULATION HIGH -- I I I LIKE TO SAY I AGREE WITH MY FRIEND -- SENATOR BILL THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS SUCCESSFUL. THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A STRONG MENTOR MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING -- OTHERWISE WE'RE RECREATING BASICALLY AN ASYLUM WHICH WE DON'T WANT MENTAL ASYLUMS WE WANT PLACES WHERE PEOPLE GET COVER WHERE PEOPLE GET APPROPRIATE MENTAL HEALTH. SERVICES AND SO IT HAS TO BE A CONJOINED A CONJOINED EFFORT AND I HOPE THAT THE GOVERNOR WILL WILL LOOK AT THAT AS A MORE THAN A ONE PRONGED ISSUE. AND THEN FOR THE LA -- IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN YOU DID A STUDY THAT SHOWED THAT THE COST OF BUILDING HOUSING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WAS. BETWEEN FIFTY AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. HAVE YOU -- UPDATED THAT STUDY DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT COST RIGHT NOW WITH I MEAN WE HAVE. SOLAR PANELS WE'RE ADDING ON NOW THAT'S GOING TO CREATE OTHER INSPECTIONS AND MORE COST WHAT NOT THAT WE DON'T WANT TO BE MORE GREEN IN CALIFORNIA. BUT EVERY INCREMENTAL ADDITION. TO OUR HOME EXPENSES PUSHING MORE PEOPLE OUT OF THE REALM OF AFFORDABILITY SO COULD YOU TELL US WHERE WE ARE WITH RESPECT OR COMPETITION. WELL UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE NOT DONE A DETAILED ANALYSIS TO UPDATE THAT FIFTY TO SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR NUMBER THE REFERENCE SINCE OUR TWENTY FIFTEEN REPORT HOWEVER I THINK. I THINK IT WOULD BE FAIR TO SAY THAT THE MOST SIGNS ARE POINTING TO THAT THE NUMBERS ARE PROBABLY SOMEONE HIGHER THAN THAT NOW WHERE WE SIT TODAY -- HOME THAT MOST OF THE FACTORS THAT THAT FEED INTO THAT -- AS YOU MENTIONED -- BUILDING CODES -- OR LABOR IN THE CONSTRUCTION MARIE COULD MATERIALS COSTS ALL THOSE THINGS -- HAVE BECOME PROBABLY MORE COSTLY SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN I DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC NUMBER FOR YOU OKAY SO -- IT THIS IS JUST ANOTHER A VARIABLE. AMONGST MANY IF WE'RE TRULY GOING TO BE IN CITING COMPETITION TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING CITY CALIFORNIA IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME. PAIN IF YOU WILL BY MANY ENTITIES TO TO DELIVER THE AMERICAN DREAM HERE IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- CAM THE LAST -- ISSUE A IS CAPITALIZE AGO WITH MY FRIEND -- CENTER MCGUIRE WAS TALKING ABOUT WAS OPPORTUNITIES OWNS -- I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS TO BE A A NARROW FOCUS ON OUR OPPORTUNITIES OWNS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE BELIEVE OR NOT DON'T KNOW WHAT OPPORTUNITIES OWNS EVEN ARE. BUT IT IS A MECHANISM WHERE AN INVESTOR COULD DIFFER A THEIR CAPITAL GAINS IF YOU WILL UNDERSTAND FOR TEN YEARS FROM. UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY SIX MAYBE THEY GET SOME EXTENSIONS TO TO NEGATE THEIR AFTER TAX ALTOGETHER BUT IT'S IT'S AN% ALTERNATIVE TO TEN THIRTY ONE EXCHANGE BUT IT'S MORE BROAD AND YOU CAN GET INVESTMENTS IN AREAS THAT. TYPICALLY NEEDED LIKE OLD REDEVELOPMENT SOME TWEAKING TO IT WOULD GIVE THE ASSURANCES TO MY COLLEAGUE THAT -- WE'RE NOT -- JUST MAKING THE RICH RICHER WERE WERE WERE ACTUALLY DOING OUR BEST TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- AND NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE STATE TREASURY -- I THINK OPPORTUNITIES OWNS OR SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO FURTHER REFINE ON AND ULTIMATELY ONCE WE GET A REFINED IS. TO TO PROMOTE THIS MODALITY OF INVESTMENT BECAUSE IT JUST CAN'T BE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO SOLVE THE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS IT NEEDS TO BE A PUBLIC. PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP AND PROBABLY MORE MONEY WITH THE RIGHT OPPORTUNITIES IS GOING TO COME FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR THE PUBLIC SECTOR. SO -- IF YOU WANNA PINE IN THAT YOU CAN BUT I I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF MY COLLEAGUES. TO DELIVER AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND AND HOUSING FOR HOMELESS THE HOMES POPULATION WITH THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF THE APPROPRIATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THANK YOU MADAM BUDGET CHAIR -- AS I SIT HERE AND I LISTEN TO ALL OF THE DISCUSSION I WANT TO COME AT THIS FROM A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT ANGLE -- WHEN WE THINK ABOUT HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS AND THE CHALLENGES I THINK THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THERE IS A HOUSING CRISIS IN THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH HOUSING? FOR WHAT I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYBODY TALK ABOUT HIS WAGES WE DO NOT IN MY OPINION ESTIMATION DO A GOOD ENOUGH JOB OF PUSHING BACK ON COMPANIES AND CORPORATIONS. WE GOT VERY EXCITED WITH OURSELVES WHEN WE PASS THE MINIMUM WAGE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHICH HASN'T TOTALLY GONE INTO EFFECT. BUT IN A COUPLE YEARS WORKERS WERE. FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO WORK FULL TIME COMES OUT TO TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. WHERE I LIVE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE WHERE IT'S CONSIDERED TO BE AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- AT APARTMENT AN OLDER APARTMENT A ONE BEDROOM IS GOING TO COST YOU FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH SO IF I MAKING FUN THAT PART TIME WORKER FROM SIMPLE TIME. AND I MAKING TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH GROSS. HOW CAN I HAVE FOR THAT ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT AT FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS WE GET VERY EXCITED WHEN PEOPLE MAKE EIGHTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR BUT THAT PENCILS OUT TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DOLLARS A MONTH? BEFORE TAXES SO IF WE DON'T PUSH BACK ON CORPORATIONS AND REQUIRE THEM TO PAY A LIVING WAGE I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'LL EVER SOLVE THIS PROBLEM I THINK WE CAN FIND MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I THINK THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE TO BE FORCED TO MAKE MORE DECISIONS AND BE A BIGGER PART OF IT. SO I JUST WANT TO ASK ALL OF US TO THINK ABOUT THAT AND THINK ABOUT REAL WAGES AND MANY AND WITH A LITTLE STORY. BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THERE WAS A YOUNG COUPLE ALBERTAN CONNIE LEIVA. WE WORKED FOR ALPHA BETA GROCERY STORE WE MAY TWELVE DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS AN HOUR AND THAT WAS THIRTY YEARS AGO I KNOW PEOPLE TODAY THAT DON'T MAKE TWELVE DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS AN HOUR. WE BOUGHT A BRAND NEW HOUSE FOR NINETY NINE NINE NINETY A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND MY PARENTS ABOUT THEIR BRAND NEW HOUSE -- PROBABLY TWENTY YEARS EARLIER IT WAS. TO WOW DO YOU THINK THAT HOUSES COULD EVER GET TO BE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR LIKE NO THAT'S JUST CRAZY TALK. WELL HERE WE ARE THIRTY YEARS LATER AND THAT HELPS THAT WE BOUGHT SELLS FOR FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND OR MORE. BACK IN -- NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT GAS WAS NINETY TWO CENTS A GALLON EGGS WERE SIXTY TWO CENTS A DOZEN SO NOW THAT HOUSEHOLDS. FOR FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND EGGS ARE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE DOLLARS A DOZEN -- GASES OF ROUGHLY FOUR DOLLARS WILL UNDER A GALLON SO WHAT SHOULD THAT GROCERY CLERK BE MAKING WHO IS MAKING TWELVE DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS THIRTY YEARS AGO. FIFTY DOLLARS AN HOUR REAL WAGES DON'T RISE THAT GROCERY CLERK MAKES TWENTY DOLLARS AND NINETY FIVE CENTS SO I THINK WE NEVER GET OUT OF THIS CYCLE. IF WE DON'T EXPECT REAL WAGES TO GO UP IF PEOPLE CANNOT PAY FOR WHATEVER HOUSING WE BUT WE BUILD IF PEOPLE CANNOT PAY FOR IT. WHEN I BOTH OF OUR DAUGHTERS LIVE IN ONTARIO THEY BOTH HAVE AN APARTMENT ONE PIECE SIXTEEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY A MONTH THE OTHER IS FOURTEEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY A MONTH FOR A ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT? AND THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT THEY LIVE WITH THAT HAVE A ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT AND IT'S A WHOLE FAMILY BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO LIVE ON MINIMUM WAGE. SO I JUST WANT TO SUBMIT THE INTEL WE REQUIRE LIVING WAGES WE ARE GOING TO ALWAYS BE IN THIS SITUATION THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT YOU'RE DOING I APPRECIATE IT -- I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING AND HELP IN ANY WAY I CAN BUT THE REAL ISSUE TO ME IS A LIVING WAGE THANK YOU. YOU MAY. YEAH. THAT WAS A POWERFUL IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO IN -- THIS PANEL ON I APPRECIATE THAT THERE ANY FINAL COMMENTS FROM THE LA -- OR FINANCE -- BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL YOU'RE WELCOME TO DO SO AS FOR BEING HERE AND HELPING TO SET THE FRAMEWORK. ON THIS CONVERSATION WE APPRECIATE YOU. I AM -- GOING TO EXERT MY POWER AS THE CHAIR YOU ALL -- TO TO DO SOME MANIPULATION OF OUR AGENDA OUR THIRD PANEL THE LOCAL PERSPECTIVE RECENT INVESTMENTS AND FURTHER NEEDS. THOSE THREE PALLETS OF ALL TRAVELS FROM OUT OF TOWN -- AND SO WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE THE ORDER AND ASK THE THIRD PANEL TO NOW JOIN US IF YOU WILL. WE BELIEVE MAYOR TUBS IS ON HIS WAY -- BUT AGAIN THIS IS THE LOCAL PERSPECTIVE WE'RE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT RECENT INVESTMENTS. WHAT'S WORKING AND FURTHER NEEDS. FROM MISTER AND SELL WHO THE DIRECTOR OF THE HOMELESS INITIATIVES FOR THAT COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. HE'LL BE FOLLOWED BY DOUG SHOE MAKER WHOSE PRESIDENT OF MERCY HOUSING CALIFORNIA AND WE THANK YOU MISTER SHOEMAKER. FOR STEP IN AND PINCH HITTING WE'D HAD A ANOTHER WITNESS WHO GOT THE FLU THIS WEEK AS WE THOUGHT IT BEST THAT. THEY NOT COME TO THE PUBLIC HEARING IF YOU GET MY DRIFT I'LL START UP TO FILL OUR SHOES YES THANK YOU [inaudible] TRANSYLVANIAN BLINKING VERY HARD WITH YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AM DELIGHTED. TO BE HERE THIS MORNING TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT. THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY MOVEMENT TO PREVENT AND COMBAT HOMELESSNESS. AND IN THAT CONTEXT SURE SOME REFLECTIONS ON ISSUES FOR YOU CONSIDER -- IN THE CONTEXT OF DEVELOPING THAT. SIR WE HAVE A HOMELESS CRISIS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AS OF JANUARY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE HAD. ABOUT FIFTY THREE THOUSAND FAMILY MEMBERS IN INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT. AND THAT CRISIS IS NOT NUDE EXISTED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WHEN A LOT OF CHANGES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. ASSUMED A COUNTY WIDE LEADERSHIP ROLE AROUND HOMELESSNESS GOING WELL BEYOND WHAT IS REQUIRED LEGALLY -- AND GOING BEYOND -- A ROLE FOR WHICH THE STATE OR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDES FUNDING. TO THE COUNTY. AND SINCE THAT TIME WHEN THE HOME WAS INITIALLY BEGAN IN AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WE'VE BUILT A POWERFUL COUNTY WIDE MOVEMENT A TRUE MOVEMENT. TO PREVENTING COMBAT HOMELESSNESS. THE HEART OF THIS MOVEMENT IS BROAD AND DEEP COLLABORATION BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPARTMENTS. WELL OVER A HUNDRED COMMUNITY BASED ON THE SERVICE PROVIDERS. MORE THAN FORTY CITIES. FAITH ORGANIZATIONS BUSINESSES THERE'S WHEN WE BEGAN AN UNPRECEDENTED COLLECTION OF OVER FOUR HUNDRED INVITED GOVERNMENT AND COMMUNITY EXPERTS CAME TOGETHER. IN THE WINTER OF TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN TO PUT OUR HEARTS AND OUR MINDS TOGETHER TO DEVELOP A COORDINATED SET OF FORTY SEVEN STRATEGIES. TO COMBAT HOMELESSNESS. THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED A STRATEGIES ON FEBRUARY NINTH. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND WITH IT THE APPROVED ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME COUNTY FUNDING. AND INSTRUCTED US TO WORK WITH THEM TO PURSUE AN ONGOING SOURCE OF LOCAL REVENUE. BECAUSE THE BOARD KNEW THAT IT WAS LOGICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SALVO NON GOING PROBLEM WITH ONE TIME FINDING. ON THAT SAME DAY THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES OF COURSE THE LARGEST CITY IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. ON FEBRUARY NINETY THOUSAND SIXTEEN ADOPTED THE FIRST EVER LOS ANGELES CITY COVERAGE OF HOMELESS STRATEGY. EXEMPLIFYING THE NEW BRIDE AND DEEP COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE COUNTY AND THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. NOW THIS UNPRECEDENTED MOVEMENT GAVE RISE IN MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO THEIR SOMEWHAT MIRACULOUS APPROVAL BY LOS ANGELES COUNTY VOTERS -- OF A SPECIAL SALES TAX ONE QUARTER PERCENT. FOR TEN YEARS LEGALLY DEDICATE HOMELESSNESS WHICH IS GENERATING AN ESTIMATED THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. I SAY MIRACULOUS BECAUSE THIS WAS AN OFF YEAR ELECTION THE FIRST TIME IN MORE. THAN A HUNDRED YEARS THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY VOTERS HAD EVEN HAD AN OPPORTUNITY -- TO PROVEN REVENUE MEASURE IN AN OFF YEAR ODD YEAR ELECTION WITH LOW VOTER TURNOUT. AND NOT STANDING -- THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES SIXTY NINE POINT 34% OF COUNTY VOTERS APPROVED MEASURE H.. OUR GOAL IS TO ENABLE FORTY FIVE THOUSAND FAMILY MEMBERS IN INDIVIDUALS TO MOVE FROM HOMELESSNESS INTO PERMANENT HOUSING IN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS. WELL ENABLING ADDITIONAL THIRTY THOUSAND FAMILIES MEMBERS INDIVIDUALS TO AVOID BECOMING HOMELESS IN THE SAME TIME PERIOD. I'M DELIGHTED TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT IN THE FIRST EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF MEASURE AGE. OVER TWENTY THREE THOUSAND HOMELESS FAMILY MEMBERS INDIVIDUALS ENTERED INNER MASSING IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY MOVING FROM BEING. I'M SHELTERED IN HOMELESS TO SHELTERED IN HOMELESS IN THAT EIGHTEEN MONTH PERIOD. DURING THAT SAME EIGHTEEN MINES FROM JULY. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO DECEMBER SIXTEEN HOMELESS FAMILY MEMBERS AND INDIVIDUALS MOVED INTO PERMANENT HOUSING. WITH MEASURE H. FINDING RENTAL SUBSIDIES AND OR SERVICES. SO WE HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARY LOCAL MOVEMENT. I'M HERE TO ANECDOTES JUDGES CONVEY DE THE BREADTH AND DEPTH OF THAT. MOVEMENT BEFORE I MOVE FORWARD. ON FEBRUARY SEVENTH TWO WEEKS AGO. THAT THE AT A MAJOR HOTEL IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES. EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE GATHERED FOR THE THIRD ANNUAL HOMELESS INITIATIVE CONFERENCE AND WE TURNED AWAY HUNDREDS MORE. IT WAS A STANDING ROOM ONLY CROWD OF FAITH LEADERS CITY REPRESENTATIVES COUNTY DEPARTMENTS PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE AND OTHERS ALTOGETHER TO REFLECT IN OUR EXPERIENCE. THROUGH THIS EXTRAORDINARY MOVE MEN AND TALK ABOUT THE CHALLENGES AHEAD. THE SECOND ANA JODIE'S EIGHT BETWEEN MARCH IN MAY OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE CONVENE A FIFTY MEMBER STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AS DIRECTED BY THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. TO DEVELOP SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR IN MEASURE H. FINDING ACROSS TWENTY ONE SPECIFIC. MEASURE EIGHT STRATEGIES ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN COLLABORATIVE REALLY DIDN'T. DEVELOPED IN THE INITIAL HOMELESS INITIATIVE PLANNING PROCESS. THOSE FIFTY STAKEHOLDERS FROM CITIES IN COUNCILS OF GOVERNMENTS HOW MUCH SERVICE PROVIDERS FAITH ORGANIZATIONS COUNTY DEPARTMENTS PHILANTHROPY AND HE WOULD LIVE EXPERIENCE. REACHED A CONSENSUS. I KNOW BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF FINDING RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. I CAN SENSE IS MARRIED THEY ANY ONE OF THOSE FIFTY STAKEHOLDERS HAD THE AUTHORITY TO BLOCK CONSENSUS. AND IF THEY HAD WE WOULD HAVE GONE TO THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WITH SPLIT RECOMMENDATIONS WITH THE MAJORITY REPORT. AND MINORITY RECOMMENDATIONS AND NOT. ONE OF THOSE FIFTY STAKEHOLDERS. BUT CONSENSUS ON THAT FINAL DAY ON MAY TENTH OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN REACH CONSENSUS ON OVER BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF FINING RECOMMENDATIONS. THE WATCH WORDS OF THAT CONSENSUS PLANNING PROCESS WERE WIND LISTEN DEEPLY TO EACH OTHER. AND SECONDLY LEAVE YOUR ORGANIZATIONAL SELF INTEREST IN THE ELEVATOR. AND OUR ABILITY TO REACH CONSENSUS ON THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS IS EXTRAORDINARY TESTAMENT. TO AN EXTRAORDINARY MOVEMENT. NOT WITHSTANDING THIS MOVEMENT AND THIS UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF LOCAL REVENUE. WE DESPERATELY NEED YOUR SUPPORT. BECAUSE THE RESOURCES WE ARE GENERATING WITH MAJOR AGE ARE INSUFFICIENT TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE CRISIS WE FACE. AS I MENTIONED AS OF JANUARY OF LAST YEAR. THERE WERE OVER FIFTY THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS LOS ANGELES COUNTY WHICH REPRESENTED A MODEST 4% REDUCTION FROM THE YEAR BEFORE THE FIRST REDUCTION. IN FOUR YEARS. I DOUBT THAT SHARE AS THE STATE'S HOMELESS EMERGENCY AID PROGRAMMER HEAP FINDING INCLUDED IN THE CURRENT YEAR BACK J. WHICH RECEIVED IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. FIRE FOR CONTINUING OF CARE AND ARE TOO LARGE CITIES. ARE BEING PUT TO USE IN MANY IMPORTANT WAYS WITH THAT COMPLIMENTED THE UTILIZING EASTER MEASURE AGE FUNDING. AND THE SINGLE BIGGEST WAY IN WHICH SAYS FANS ARE BEING UTILIZED CURRENTLY ARE FOR INNER MOUTH SCENE. BUT CAPITAL COSTS AND OPERATING COSTS. SO IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR LOCAL EXPERIENCE BOTH WITH THE CURRENT GROUND IF HE BINDING. AND THE OUR PRICE A LOCAL MOVEMENT THAT I'VE DESCRIBED. I'D LIKE TO SHARE FOR CONSIDERATIONS THAT WE HELP THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR WILL CONSIDER. AS YOU ADDRESS THE PROVISION. OF WHY -- HOPEFULLY VERY SUBSTANTIAL ONE TIME FINDING TO LOCALITIES TO HELP AS COMBAT HOMELESSNESS. FIRST WE URGE YOU TO MAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF ONE TIME FINDING THAT YOU PROVIDE. WE UNDERSTAND THE REDDISH STAINS TO COMMIT THE STATE TO AN ONGOING FINING STORES THAT WE WOULD OF COURSE VERY MUCH LIKE TO SEE ARE NOT GOING FINING SHORES. BUT IF THE ULTIMATE DECISION IS ONE TIME WE ARE G. MAKE THE ONE TIME POD AS LARGE AS POSSIBLE. END TO ALIGN THE LENGTH OF TIME OVER WHICH THAT FINING CAN BE USED WITH THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT YOU PROVIDE AND TO ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. THE TIME FRAME FOR THE UTILIZED ATION OF THE CURRENT HEAT FINDING. FOR EXAMPLE THE CURRENT HE FINING OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS EFFECTIVELY AVAILABLE TO BE USED OVER TWO FISCAL YEARS AND A LITTLEBIT OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. IF FOR EXAMPLE THE ONE TIME AMOUNT WERE A BILLION DOLLARS IT MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE TO ALLOW THOSE FRIENDS TO BE USED OVER FOUR YEAR PERIOD. RATHER NEW TWO YEAR PERIOD THAT WOULD NOT PRE THEN LOCALITIES THAT COULD EFFECTIVELY UTILIZE THE FINDING MORE QUICKLY FROM DOING CHAU. BUT WOULD ALSO ALLOW FOR A LONGER TERM. APPROACH AND ADD THE POTENTIALLY MAXIMIZE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE UTILIZATION OF THAT ONE TIME STATE FRIEND -- SECONDLY WE WOULD URGE THAT. ANYONE TIME ST FUNDING FOR LOCALITIES INCLUDED IN THE FIX YOUR NINETEEN TWENTY STATE BUDGET. BE AVAILABLE FOR RAPID RE HOUSING AS WELL AS FOR INTERIM HAS A AND NAVIGATION CENTERS AS THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED. RAPID RE HOUSING IS A CRITICAL COMPLIMENTING ROOM HOUSING RAPID RE HOUSING PROVIDES TIME LIMITED RENTAL SUBSIDIES OF SIXTY TWENTY FOUR MINDS WITH INTENSIVE SERVICES. FOR FAMILIES IN A DAHLE TO HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF GAINING A REGAINING THE ABILITY TO PAY THEIR OWN RIGHT. TYPICALLY FOR EMPLOYMENT THOSE SET IN SOME INSTANCES THROUGH FEDERAL DISABILITY BENEFITS AS WELL. BEING ABLE TO EXPAND RAPID. IS VERY IMPORTANT. AND THE INFUSION OF A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF STATE FINING THAT COULD ONLY BE USED FOR IN YOUR MOUTH SEEN. COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF CREATING AN IMBALANCE IN OUR SYSTEM SIMILAR TO THE IMBALANCE THAT WOULD RESULT. IF HOSPITALS INCREASED EMERGENCY ROOM BEDS BUT DDN'T INCREASE THE NUMBER OF BEDS FOR PEOPLE TO GO FROM THE EMERGENCY ROOMS IN OTHER WORDS EXPANDING INTERMETALLIC ZINE WITHOUT EXPANDING. RENTAL SUBSIDIES TO PAY FOR PERMANENT HOUSING HAS THE EFFECT AS INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE LIVING IN SHELTER. WITHOUT THE ABILITY FOR THEM TO MOVE INTO PERMANENT HOUSING. LEADING THEIR TO BE BOTH AN ACCUMULATION OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN SHELTER. AND NO REDUCTION OVERTIME IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON THE STREET BECAUSE THEIR PEOPLE TODAY ON THE STREET COULD MOVE AND IN OUR MAGAZINE. PEOPLE WHO ENTER HOMELESSNESS TOMORROW OR NEXT WEEK OR NEXT MONTH WOULD HAVE NOWHERE TO GO SO WE URGE THAT THERE BE FLEXIBILITY. IN BALANCING INNER AND HAS SEEN AND RAPID RE HOUSING WITH ANYONE TIME STATE FUNDING. THIRDLY WE WOULD URGE THE ANY NEW STATE FUNDING BE ALLOCATED GEOGRAPHICALLY BASED ON NEED. IN RE AS REFLECTED IN THE ANNUAL HOMELESS COUNT. WEEK KNOWLEDGE THAT SMALL COUNTIES. OFTEN NEED IN A STATE ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY SEPARATE TREATMENT TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE -- AND NOW DEFINING THEY CAN BE MEANINGFUL UTILIZED BUT ONCE A BASE LEVEL OF FINDING IS MATT. FOUR SMALL COUNTIES WE ARE THEY'RE FINDING BE ALLOCATED PROPORTIONATE TO NEED. AND THEN FINALLY. THE CURRENT HEAP AT FINDING CARRIED WITH IT A REQUIREMENT. FOR CITIES TO ADOPT EMERGENCY SHELTER DECLARATIONS. IN ORDER FOR THERE TO BE NO RESTRICTIONS ON THE UTILIZATION OF STEEP OF HEAT FINDING WITH IN THOSE CITIES. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION SEEK TO ESTABLISH ANY REQUIREMENTS FOR CITIES. THAT WOULD IMPACT THE UTILIZATION OF A NEW ROUND OF ONE TIME STATE FUNDING. WE WOULD URGE THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN THE MINISTRATION ADOPT A MENU OF OPTIONS THAT CITIES COULD COMPLY WITH. IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE MEANINGFULLY IN COMBATING HOMELESSNESS LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR CITIES BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT CITIES HAVE A CRITICAL ROLE TO PLAY. AROUND LAW ENFORCEMENT. LAND USE AND HOUSING HOUSING PARTICULARLY IN THOSE CITIES THAT ADMINISTER THEIR OWN PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITIES. AND RECENTLY FORTY ONE CITIES IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY COMPLETED MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND PAGES OF CITY SPECIFIC HOMELESSNESS PLANS WITH PLANNING GRANTS. PROVIDED BY LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AND THROUGH THOSE FORTY ONE CITY SPECIFIC HOMELESSNESS PLANS CITIES CAME FORWARD WITH THE RANGE OF CREATIVE AND VERY HELPFUL ACTIONS WHICH THEY INTEND TO TAKE. TICU AS PART OF THE COUNTY WIDE MOVEMENT TO PREVENTING COMBAT HOMELESSNESS WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN DRYING ON THE IDEAS PUT FORWARD BY CITIES IN LOS ANGELES CAN YOU. HAVE ACTIONS FROM WHICH CITIES COULD CHOOSE IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE. ANY RESTRICTIONS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE APPLY TO THE UTILIZATION OF THE FUTURE ROUND OF ONE TIME STATE FINDING -- I ONE TIME STATE FUNDING WITHIN THOSE CITIES. LET ME JUST CLOSE IF YOU'LL ALLOW ME IN SHARING WITH YOU A QUOTE. THAT I FREQUENTLY USE IN SPEAKING TO THE LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. WHO ARE PART OF THIS MOVEMENT? THE BUDDHIST SID THAT A SINGLE CANDLE CAN LIGHT A THOUSAND OTHERS WITHOUT DIMINISHING ITSELF. AND WHAT WE FIND IN THIS MOVEMENT IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS THAT. NEW CANDLES ARE BEING LATE EVERY DAY. AS MORE MORE INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS JOIN THIS MOVEMENT AND THE SAME PASSION THAT YOU DEMONSTRATED TODAY. AROUND BRINGING ARE HOMELESS NEIGHBOR'S HOME HE SHARED BY PEOPLE THROUGH AN ORGANIZATION% SALAS ANGELES COUNTY BECAUSE UNIQUELY IN MY EXPERIENCE. EVERY HUMAN BEING. CARES ABOUT HOMELESSNESS. AND NO ONE IS FOR IT. AND THAT COMMON GROUND GIVES US THE ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER. THE STATE [inaudible] THE COUNTY. CITIES AT ALL OF OUR LOCAL PARTNERS TO BRING OUR HOMELESS NUMBERS ON THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MUCH APPRECIATE THAT OUR COLLEAGUES TO GET A HOLD OUR QUESTIONS TO THE IN THE PANEL AND WE'RE GONNA TRANSITION BACK TO BUY A WHOLE WIRE AFFECTIONATELY REFERRED TO AS MY MAYOR. ALTHOUGH I HAVE NEVER RESIDED IN YOUR GREAT CITY BUT WELCOME MAYOR TAPS WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING YOUR PERSPECTIVE -- THANK YOU MANAGEMENT MADAM CHAIR AND AND AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS SOME. BOBBI BRIEFER I PERSONALLY WANT TO MAKE THIS PRESENTATION MYSELF FOR FOR A COUPLE REASONS OF A COUPLE WEEKS AGO I WOKE UP AT SIX AM WITH ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. TO A POINT IN TIME HOMELESSNESS COUNT. ON IT'S ONE THING TO READ ABOUT AND HEAR ABOUT IT BUT ACTUALLY CLIMBING UP INTO THE OVERPASSES ADMIN BARKED AT BY PIT BULLS WHO WERE TRAINED IN. SEEING FOLKS LIVING IN TENTS AND LIVING IN CHILDREN AND FIT FOR HUMAN BEINGS CAUSED ME TO QUESTION WHAT WAS I DOING ON TO LIVE UP TO MY SPOUSE VALUES IN TALKING ABOUT THE DIGNITY INHERENT DIGNITY -- OF OF EVERY HUMAN BEING AND I THINK ESPECIALLYFOR CALIFORNIA. OF AS A GOLDEN STATE AS THE SIDE THE RESISTANCE I DON'T THINK WE CAN BE HAT IF THE MOST MARGINALIZED PEOPLE OUR COMMUNITY ACROSS THE FOLKS ARE EXPERIENCING THE BRIGHT. AS A FORTY BUILDING HOUSING CRISIS FOR EVERY ISSUE I THINK OF MY LGBT YOUTH. OR OFTENTIMES KICKED OUT OF THEIR HOMES ARE HOMELESS I THINK OF WOMEN FLEEING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. I THINK OF STUDENTS I TAUGHT WHO TOLD THEM THEY WORK HARD IF THEY DO EVERYTHING RIGHT THEY CAN GO TO COLLEGE. ARE IN COLLEGE NUMBER HOMELESS I THINK OF SINGLE MOTHERS LIKE MY MOTHER I THINK OF WHO WERE LIVE DRIVERS I I THINK OF CHILDREN WHO DO NOT KNOW FATHER OWN. OF OUR LIVING IN TENTS AND WE STILL EXPECT OVER THE SCHOOL IN EITHER EVERYDAY THAT SO YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT TO MAKE THIS PRESENTATION MYSELF. ON BECAUSE AS YOU ALL KNOW IT'S A CRISIS. IS ACROSS OF EPIDEMIC PROPORTIONS AND WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. CHEN ZONING WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT BUILDINGS WERE NOT JUST HER WHAT CONSTRUCTION WE'RE TALKING OR WHAT TOPIC COMMUNITY WHAT TYPE OF SOCIETY WOULD HAVE A STATE WE WENT LIVE IN. OR TALK ABOUT HUMAN BEINGS ON A IN IN THEIR INHERENT DIGNITY. I'M ACCORDING TO HIDE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN STOCKTON AND AND TERMS OF URBAN CITIES NOT THE MARCY'S BUT URBAN CITIES HAVE MORE HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS PER CAPITA. AND FOR ME AS MAYOR THAT THAT'S AN ISSUE. ON THE MEDIAN INCOME IN STOCKTON SAN JOAQUIN COUNTIES ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS LESS THAN THE RATE REST OF THE STATE. OF THE PAST YEAR WE'VE HAD WHEN THE FACETS RISING RATE MARKETS IN IN IN IN THIS COUNTRY -- APPARENTLY EIGHTEEN THOUSAND EXTREMELY LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS CANNOT FIND HOUSING TODAY ALMOND IN MY CITY. AND IN THE END I ITEMS FOCUSING ON STOCKTON BUT AS YOU ARE THOSE ARE JUST THE STOCK IN THE SURE SAKE COUNTY ISSUE THE STATE ISSUE. ONSITE YOU WENT OFF AS A THANK YOU OFFER LEADERSHIP YOU GUYS HAVE SHOWN. IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS OUR MENTORS ALLOCATIONS OF EXCITED THIS YEAR THAT'S OCT IS NOW PARTY BIG MAYOR'S BIG CITY COALITION SO WE'LL HAVE SOME KEEP FINDING TO REALLY BEGIN. TO HOUSE A WORK OF ART IT'S ME OVER CARE TOUCH OUR INDIVIDUALS IN OUR COMMUNITY -- OUR OUR HOUSE I I FOUND OUT THIS AND EIGHTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH -- BUT 50% OF OUR FOLKS LIVE WORK ON MINIMUM WAGE JOBS WHICH IS ACTUALLY NOT US FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR I'VE LEARNED -- RECENTLY THAT STOCKTON IS NUMBER THIRD IN THE NATION AMONG LARGE URBAN CEO SEES FOR THE NUMBER THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND AGAIN NUMBER ONE THE MONTHS LARGELY URBAN FEEL FEES. FOR THE NUMBERS ARE PERSON EXPERIENCING FAMILY HOMELESSNESS AND IN IN IN IN THE MIDST OF THIS CRISIS WERE NOT JUST STANDING AROUND AND DOING NOTHING WE'RE DOING ALL WE CAN WITH THE MEAGER RESOURCES WE HAVE SO WE'VE ALLOCATED TO GENERAL FUND DOLLARS. COMPRESSES DOLLARS TO TO HOUSING TO THE CLEAN UPS WE PARTNER WITH CAL. ON TO FOCUS AND TARGET SOME INDIVIDUALS ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS TO CONNECT THEM WITH JOBS AND AND AND AND SERVICES. ARE WE'VE CREATE A HOUSING MITIGATION FUND TO TRY ENTICE LANDLORDS TO TAKE SOME THE DIFF VOUCHERS AND THINGS PROVIDED FOR INDIVIDUALS. WHO ARE HOMELESS WE'RE VERY ACTIVE IN OUR CONSUMER CARE OF THE SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS WE RECEIVED A ONE TIME HE PLANS LAST YEAR WE WERE ABLE TO HOUSE? FOLKS IN PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN THE HOUSING AUTHORITY IN THE SHELTER AND LOW INCOME HOUSING PROVIDERS WITH OUR COMMUNITY MEDICAL CLINICS WITH. MOVEMENT SOCIAL SERVICES AND IN WITH THEM. AND INNOVATIVE FORM CALLED READY TO WORK I'M REALLY THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX ABOUT HOW THE ATTACK THIS ISSUE OF HOUSING AFFORDABILITY IN HOMELESSNESS. MEANS UNDERSTANDING THAT HOUSING IS DEFINITELY FROM THE MIDDLE AND WE'RE MOVING. ON THAT'S BECAUSE I LIKE TO WERE MOVING TOWARDS A HOUSING FIRST APPROACH BUT ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT FOLKS THE JOBS FOLK THINGS OPPORTUNITY -- EIGHT EIGHT X. CETERA. BUT WITH THE SEVEN ARE HE BALLOT CATION OF COURSE THAT THAT THAT THAT THE RESOURCES DON'T MEET THE NEEDS ARE BUDGET GREAT PROJECTS WE WE WEREN'T ABLE TO FIND THIS PAST YEAR. BY PROVIDING HOUSING SUPPORT SERVICES CASE MANAGEMENT COUNSELING TALKING ON JOB COUNSELLING AND ANGIE THE COMPLETION NOT BECAUSE IT WASN'T IMPORTANT. THAT BECAUSE IT WAS A PRIORITY NOT BECAUSE WHEN THEY HELP THIS EPIDEMIC WERE FACING BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE A AND THE FREE SOURCES WE WEREN'T ABLE. TO FURTHER SINCE OF AYE LOW INCOME HOUSING CORPORATION WHICH WILL ALLOW THEM A FOUR TIME HOUSING NAVIGATOR IN WOULD ALLOW THEM TO CREATE A NEW PROGRAM TO TARGET INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGHER IN THE AIR AND MEDIAN INCOME. WHICH NOT OTHERWISE ALLOW WITH FEDERAL DOLLARS AGAIN WE YOU IT'S GOOD PROJECT AT THIS HEARTBREAKING THE WITH A RESOURCE TO BE HAD WHEREVER THE FIGHT WE WEREN'T ABLE -- TO TO FIND THAT SO I THINK THE ASK FOR FOR THIS COMMITTEE IS TO CONTINUE TO WORK YOU ARE DOING AND THAT YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN HERE SINCE EARLY THIS MORNING TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE. I KNOW MANY OF YOU ON THIS CAN BE DONE JUST TALK YES YOU DO ACTION SOME OF THE FIRST SAID MAYOR STOCK AND I STAND. BY EVERYTHING A BUNCH OF MERS WERE EXCITED ABOUT WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ENSURING THAT WE SHOW THAT THE GOLDEN STATE IS ACTUALLY TRULY A GOLDEN STATE FOR ALL I I STRUGGLE WITH THIS IDEA. OF CALIFORNIA BEING AGAIN THIS IN YOUR THE RESISTANCE IF POOR PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO LIVE WORK AND A STATE. I STRUGGLE WITH THIS IDEA THAT WERE REVOLUTIONARY AND STOCKPILING A BASIC INCOME WHEN FOLKS WHO BENEFIT THE MOST FROM BASIC INCOME CAN'T CAN'T CAN'T CAN'T CAN'T AFFORD RENT. I I STRUGGLE WITH THIS WITH THIS IDEA THAT THAT EVERYTHING'S GREAT AND SUNNY THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD THINGS BE PRAGUE OF BUT AGAIN THE FOLKS I REPRESENT FOLKS FROM THE COMMUNITY ACTUALLYCOME FROM. MY OWN FAMILY MEMBERS MY MOTHER ACCEPTED A CONSULAR CALLING IN SAYING WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT HOUSING TO RENT KEEPS RISING THE RENT IS TOO DAMN HIGH AND WHAT'S THE PLAN A STRATEGY -- FOR FOR ROUTING ADDRESSING IT SO SOME THE IDEAS WE'VE HEARD THIS MEET FROM THE FUNDING SHORTFALLS WI FI I'M TRYING TO BUILD AFFORDABLE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR PEOPLE -- I THINK TAX INCREMENT FINANCING FOR FOR A HOUSING PROJECTS OR SOMETHING -- MANY CITIES IN CONSUMER CARE TO BE VERY INTERESTED IN -- I THINK OTHER STATE AGENCY TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERSHIPS BUT THE WINNER TO MAKE CALTRANS COULD BE HUGE SPACE WITH ALL THE STATE OWNED LAND. ON THAT'S OFTENTIMES BAKING AND USED OUR COMMUNITIES I THINK ALMONDS SOCCER MATCHES UNDER UNDER PASSES BUT OUR FAIRGROUNDS EXETER THERE'S PLACES WHERE WE COULD DO SOME REALLY COOL WORK AROUND PERMITS SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. AND HOUSING FIRST FOR FOR HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND I THINK. I'M GLAD THIS COMMITTEES TALKING ABOUT HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE AS YOU ALL KNOW THEY'RE RELATED AS THE LA -- REPORT TOLD US THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE INTERTWINED BUT THEY'RE DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS AND AGAIN PRODUCTIONS NOT NOT SIMPLY ENOUGH WE COULD BUILD ALL THE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND OUR HOMES AND ONE IN STOCKTON BECAUSE SOME CISCO SACRAMENTO'S CAN MORE EXPENSIVE HE WILL COME BY ON THAT DOES NOTHING. FOR THAT MAINTENANCE WORKER THAT DOES NOTHING FOR THE JANET AT THIS NOTHING OFFER A LOT OF FOLKS MY COMMUNITY SO REALLY FIGURED OUT HOW DO YOU BUILD. HOUSING BUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND AND WHEN THE THINGS I SAY IN STOCK ALL THE TIME MADAM CHAIR IS IF YOU HATE HOMELESSNESS YOU NOW LOVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IF YOU A HOMELESS THIS YOU WERE IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCATE WE WE WANT AFFORDABLE HOUSING EVERYWHERE. BECAUSE IN OUR SEIZE BECOME TO THE POINT WHERE WE'RE HOMELESSNESS THIS JOB IN THE COUNTY HE'S FOR THIS WITH AMAZING WORK. LEADING R. C. O. C. NOT ALSO SAY I'M FOR COMMUNITIES MORE RURAL COMMUNITY SMALLER COMMUNITIES THERE MIGHT EVEN BE THE TECHNICAL THE EXPERTISE OF THE CAPACITY TO DO SO THESE COMPLEX THINGS SO I THINK IF HE CAN GO. FROM THE RULES CITY SOME IN THE CALIFORNIA CITY CENTRAL VALLEY CITIES MAYBE SOME HELP AND CAN PEOPLE UP TO DATE ABOUT WHAT IS HOUSING FIRST HOW DO YOU DO IT HOW YOU USE THAT FOR AN UC'S TOOLS COLLECTED PASSED YOU MAY NOT BE THERE AND AND THEN SOME FOLKS. THE BILL THE MORE TENSE. ARM IT IS IS A SOLUTION FOR FOR HOUSING THE FORTY TO THE HOMELESSNESS AND IT FIT EXACTLY EXACTLY CENTURY THEY SIMPLY. IS NOT BUT I THINK WHAT WE SEE IN THAT THAT FOLKS JUST WANT US TO DO SOMETHING. RYAN TO BE EASY FOR ME TO SAY THAT BY FIFTY NEW TENANTS PUT HIM OVER HERE AND I COULD GET A GOOD PRICE FOR A DAY. BUT UNTIL WE WORK WITH YOU ALL WITH OUR COUNTY TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO YOU BUILD MORE HOUSING CRITICALLY HOW TO BUILD A FOUR HOUSING HOW TO BE LOVED FOREVER HOUSING HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THAT. THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE OUR STATE GREAT. THE FOLKS WHO DO ALL THE JOBS THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO DO. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO TO REFRAIN CONTINUE TO PROSPER AND ROSE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORKING LEADERSHIP I'M HERE TO PARTNER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WAS THE MAYOR AND I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE TENSE ARE FOR CAMPING NOT RAISING CHILDREN AND ARE GROWING OLD IN. AND WEEKLY NOT IN THIS COLD pAND IF YOU. COULD STAY WITH US FOR A MINUTE WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM OUR LAST WITH THIS AND WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THANK YOU MISTER SHOEMAKER THANK YOU THANKS THANKS FOR THE TIME TIRED OF ALL THE MAYOR THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE SOMETHING IT'S VERY EASY TO DO. BUT THIS WAY BECAUSE TIME -- I'M DOUG TO MAKE ON THE PRESIDENT MERCY HOUSING CALIFORNIA I'M ALSO HERE AS IT IS ON PRODUCTION AND PRESERVATION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR LOW AND MODERATE INCOME. HOUSEHOLDS -- SOME OF YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH MERCY HOUSING SOME NOT -- WE'RE A NONPROFIT HOUSING DEVELOPER WE WORK THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I'M READING IN ROSEVILLE TO THE BAY AREA DOWN TO SAN DIEGO AND LOS ANGELES IN BAKERSFIELD. OR ACTIVE IN ABOUT TEN DIFFERENT COUNTIES IN THE STATE -- WERE SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL IN THAT WE DEVELOP BOTH FAMILY HOUSING SENIOR HOUSING AND WHERE ONE OF THE LARGEST SUPPORTIVE HOUSING -- DEVELOPERS AND PROVIDERS IN THE STATE IN THE COUNTRY. SO WE SORT OF BRING A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE I THINK TO THE WORK AND WORK WITH MANY GREAT JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE STATE AND I THINK FIRST AND FOREMOST I JUST WANT TO SAY I THINK -- I'VE BEEN IN THIS FIELD FROM WAS TWENTY FIVE YEARS -- I THINK I'VE NEVER BEEN IN A MOMENT WHERE THERE'S BEEN SUCH CLEAR LEADERSHIP AT THE STATE LEVEL IN TERMS OF WANTING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE ON THIS. OBVIOUSLY THAT'S DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE'VE DUG OURSELVES A HOLE THAT IS BIGGER THAN ANY THAT I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED IN MY LIFE AND I'M. HOPEFULLY ANY MY KIDS LIVES -- SO IT'S BOTH GOOD NEWS AND BAD FOCUSED ON THIS -- AS MANY PEOPLE OF ALLUDED TO WE'VE GOT MASSIVE ISSUES AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S COR ADDS IT COMES DOWN TO A FEW THINGS -- ONE OF WHICH IS IS THE ABSOLUTE SHORTAGE. OF OF HOMES THAT ARE AFFORDABLE THE LOW AND MODERATE INCOME FOLKS ANYTHING UNLESS WE GET TO THAT. BASIC CORE CONCEPT WE'RE NOT GOING TO REALLY SOLVE THE PROBLEMS ON I'M HAPPY THAT SO MUCH OF THE BUDGET PROPOSAL IS REALLY FOCUSED ON PRODUCTION. AND I WANT TO JUST COMPLEMENT THE LEGISLATURE ON THE GREAT WORK THAT HAPPENED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IN TERMS TO HEAP. AND SB TO AND ARE GREAT WORK WITH MANY OF YOU AROUND THE PASSAGE OF PROPOSITION ONE AND TWO WERE EAGER TO GET THAT MONEY OUT THE DOOR -- I KNOW FOLKS HAVE TALKED ABOUT WILL GOSH WE'VE GOT SO MUCH MONEY FLOWING OUT WE POSSIBLY NEED MORE COMING OUT OF THE STATE BUDGET. I CAN JUST TELL YOU THAT WE WE WE WORK IN A BIZARRE FIELD IN WHICH WE RATION OUT. YOU KNOW A DOLLAR A YEAR. TO A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND WE ACT AS IF. BY GIVING OUT SMALL AMOUNTS EVERY YEAR WE'RE GONNA DO SOMETHING WE'RE TREADING WATER AT BEST. AND IT'S BEEN A LOT WORSE IN RECENT YEARS. WE SORT OF CHOOSE BETWEEN WHICH OF THE DIFFERENT HOUSING PROBLEMS WERE TRYING TO SOLVE OR RESOVE IN HOMELESSNESS. ARE WE SOLVING THE PROBLEM FOR THE MINIMUM WAGE WORKER WE SOLVE THE PROBLEM FOR THE SENIOR -- WE OBVIOUSLY ARE NOT GOING TO SUCCEED AS A STATE LESS WE DO ALL OF THOSE THINGS AT ONCE -- AND WE'RE NOWHERE CLOSE TO DOING THAT AT THE MOMENT I I WILL SAY I THINK THERE'S A TON OF THINGS IN THIS BUDGET. BETTER FANTASTIC THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS US A JUST BRIEFLY MENTION THAT I THINK THAT. THE FOCUS ON THE FLEXIBLE OPERATING SUBSIDY POOL IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PROPOSAL AND WE DO WORK AND IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND I THINK. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE LARGEST HOMELESS POPULATION IN THE STATE AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST IN THE COUNTRY. I CAN'T IMAGINE A MORE WELL ORGANIZED APPROACH THAT THIS WORK AND IF OTHER COUNTIES IN THE STATE COULD COPY WHAT LOS ANGELES IS DOING. AND THEY COULD USE THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO MIMIC WHAT IS BEING DONE AND THE STATE COULD SOUND REINFORCE. THE NEED TO DO THAT IT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT -- THE ANALOGY SOMEBODY MADE FROM THE OTHER DAYS LOS ANGELES IS A BIT LIKE GOING INTO AN APPLE STORE YOU WALK IN. YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU'RE A HOUSING DEVELOPER AND YOU WANT DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT AS IN THERE'S SUBSIDY FOR RENTS. THERE'S MONEY TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS CASE MANAGERS FROM EASY. BUT IT'S ALL TOGETHER IN CONTRAST MANY OF THE ECONOMY THAT WE WORK AND GREAT LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS GREAT APPOINTED STAFF. BUT YOU REALLY GOING TO A NINETEEN EIGHTIES YOU KNOW TECHNOLOGY STORE WHICH THEY SAY I DON'T KNOW THE CPU MICHAEL WITH THIS MODEM I REALLY DON'T KNOW. AND YOU SORT OF END UP GOING DOOR TO DOOR TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CONNECT ALL THE DOTS. THAT OUGHT TO BE CONNECTED PROBLEMATICALLY AND SO I THINK AS YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE MONEY THAT YOU'RE USING I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. PRICKLY THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IT'S BEING DELIVERED AS AN INCENTIVE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT YOU YOU DO MORE. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT BECOMES A LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE THE APPLE STORE THAT IS LOS ANGELES AND A LITTLE BIT LESS LIKE CRAZY EDDIE'S OR WHATEVER WHATEVER YOUR ANALOGY MY DAY -- I'M NOT I'M NOT SAYING THAT I JUST WANT TO SAY I DO THINK THAT THAT THAT POOL OF FUNDS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS REALLY IMPORTANT WE WORK WITH AND MANY AMAZING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. I WOULD JUST SAY THAT IT IS NOT UNUSUAL WHEN I TALK TO MY COLLEAGUES TO YOUR ABOUT HUNDRED THOUSAND HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN IMPACT FEES. FOUR INDIVIDUAL UNITS OF HOUSING SO WHEN YOU'RE BUILDING A GIANT. YOU KNOW HUNDRED UNIT OR TWO HUNDRED UNIT OF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A LOCAL JURISDICTION EFFECTIVELY [inaudible] WASHING. AFFORDABLE HOUSING MONEY. TO PAY FOR ALL THESE OTHER THINGS AND I DON'T THINK IS A STATE WE CAN AFFORD THAT ANYMORE -- I WOULD REALLY LOVE TO SEE THE LEGISLATURE TAKES INACTION IN THAT REGARD AND I THINK THAT FIGHTER MILLION DOLLARS IN INCENTIVES -- MIGHT BE A PLACE FOR YOU TO THINK ABOUT WHERE YOU WOULD APPLY THAT AND WHERE THAT WOULD GO O COMMUNITIES THAT REALLY. DO SOMETHING TO EITHER REDUCE OR WAIVE THOSE FEES I THINK WOULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF GOVERNMENTAL BEHAVIOR. MAKES A LITTLE BIT LESS DIFFICULT FOR US TO EXPLAIN TO VOTERS YOU DON'T REALIZE THAT. YOU'RE ACTUALLY PAYING A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN PARKING SCHOOL FEES WITH THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DOLLARS. SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING I'D RECOMMEND ON THE ON THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS -- FOR NEW STATE TAX CREDITS THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT MEASURE WERE VERY EXCITED ONE ECHO THE COMMENTS PLEASE PUT AS MUCH MONEY. ONE TIME AS YOU CAN INTO THIS BUDGET IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN'T KEEP THINGS -- OBVIOUSLY WE'D LIKE TO SEE THE STATE TAX CREDIT RECORD THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT IS IN MANY WAYS THE BACKBONE. OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR THE ENTITIES IN PRACTICALLY EVERY PROJECT IS BUILT AROUND THE STATE -- IT'S WE HAVE ABOUT THREE THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED UNITS IN DEVELOPMENT AROUND THE AROUND THE STATE ABOUT TEN DIFFERENT COUNTIES. I CAN TELL YOU THAT EVERYONE OF THOSE INVOLVED ALONG CANALS AND TAX CREDIT AS ITS CORE FINANCE AND IF THERE WERE MORE OF IT WE WOULD BE BUILDING ARE PROJECTS FASTER AND WE DELIVERING. HOMES TO PEOPLE THAT NEED IT ONE THING I I DO WANT TO SAY IS -- YOU KNOW IT'S THE FIRST TIME WE'VE SEEN AN EMPHASIS ON THE MODERN INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. IN THAT STATE TAX CREDIT PROGRAM. I KNOW I SPEAK FOR A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES IN SAYING I THINK THAT'S THE TIME HAS COME TO DO THAT KIND OF WORK AND I THINK IT'S IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT MOVE FORWARD ON THAT. I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT IT IS. TO EIGHT THERE'S NO REASON THE PROGRAM COULDN'T JUST THAT AND I'M PROGRAM WHICH I THINK WOULD BE A DISSERVICE TO ALL OF THE NEEDS THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE SO I'M SURE THAT -- MARINO WHINER RAY PEARL FROM THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK ON THAT. AS YOU GET TO IT -- THIRTY THERE MANY OTHER THINGS I WANTED TO SPEAK TO I GUESS I JUST WANT TO FOCUS ON ON THE FACT THAT ON THE THE THE CHALLENGE WE REALLY HAVE IS A STATE. IS THAT. FOR EVERY PERSON THAT MERCY HOUSING OR THE CITY LOS-ANGELES OR THE CITY STOCKTON. GETS OUT OF HOMELESSNESS. WE'VE GOT TWO MORE PEOPLE FALLING IN BECAUSE THAT THE PROBLEMS ARE SO SEVERE -- AND I THINK WE WANT TO CAUTION I THINK A LITTLE BIT AROUND RUSHING TO THE SCENE OF THE FIRE. AND NOT INVOLVING OURSELVES IN FIRE PREVENTION -- AND I THINK I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW IS THE STATE AND I THINK CENTER SKINNER FOR TO THIS EARLIER. WHEN SHE TALKED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE AS A AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR SOME OF THE OTHER WORKERS ARE IN THE STATE? WE WE SIMPLY HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PEOPLE ARE FALLING INTO HOMELESSNESS. MUCH FASTER THAN WE'RE GETTING THEM OUT. AND SO WE CAN'T SIMPLY AND WE'RE A PERMANENT SO KLAY FOCUS ON PERMITS FOR BOUGHS AND WHAT WE SEE IN THE STATE IS THAT WE ALMOST ROUTINELY IGNORE. EXTREMELY LOW AND VERY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE NOT IN THE SPECIALTY POPULATIONS WHEN WE RUN. TO THE TO THE NEW TO THE NEW CRISIS OF THE DAY. AND WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT I I WOULD JUST TELL YOU THAT THERE IS A REAL SHOCKING -- LACK OF FOCUS ON THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THIS MASSIVE DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE OF SENIORS YOU'RE ALL AWARE THAT NOBODY HAS TO TELL YOU WHAT THE BABY BOOM AS OF THAT THE RETIRING -- BUT WE HAVE ALMOST NOTHING HAPPENING IN A CONCERTED WAY IN TERMS OF FEDERAL OR STATE POLICY TO ADDRESS. THE FACT WE HAVE SO MANY SENIORS WHO ARE. ARE ON THE EDGE OF HOMELESSNESS AND FALLING ALMOST AS AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER SENIORS ARE IN FACT THE FASTEST GROWING PART OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION BUT THEY'RE CERTAINLY AMONG THEM -- AND THERE'S GOING TO GROW BIGGER AND IT'S GOING TO GROW BIGGER BECAUSE WE ARE REALLY NOT TRYING TO DO SOMETHING SPECIFIC AROUND SENIOR HOUSING. LASTLY I JUST WANNA. I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH A STORY I USED TO BE THE HOUSING RECTOR OF SAN FRANCISCO UNDER NOW GET GOVERNOR KNEW SOME OF WHEN HE WAS MAYOR OF SAN FRANCISCO AND I REMEMBER BEING CALLED OUT -- WHEN THE PICO GROUPS AND IN SAN FRANCISCO HAS BEEN A MEETING AT ST ANTHONY'S CHURCH AND THE MISSION DISTRICT? AND IT WAS A GROUP OF LARGE LATINO HOUSEHOLDS. AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE HOMELESSNESS PREFERENCE THAT WE HAD PUT ON A NEW BUILDING -- AND HOW IT WAS SPECIFICALLY FOR P. HOMELESS. AND THIS WOMAN TURNED TO ME AND SHE SAID LOOK. I SLEEP IN A ONE BEDROOM UNIT WITH MY SON AND MY DAUGHTER. I AM NOT THROWN MYSELF ON THE STREET I'M NOT THROW MYSELF IN A SHELTER. I'VE DONE EVERYTHING RIGHT. I WORK IN A REALLY HARD JOB AND YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT I'M EXCLUDED FROM HAVING A SHOT AT THIS HOUSING. BECAUSE I'M DOING ALL THE RIGHT THINGS [inaudible] AND YEAH I MEAN YOU COULD TELL THAT THAT WAS A AN INCREDIBLY POWERFUL MOMENT FOR ME PERSONALLY -- THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN SAY% ABOUT THAT YOU JUST RECOGNIZE THE INHERENT LACK OF WISDOM OF YOUR OWN OF YOUR OWN POLICY MAKING AT THAT MOMENT -- BUT THE REALITY IS THAT'S BECAUSE WE'RE WORKING ON A SYSTEM A SCARCITY -- AND IF WE WERE WORKING THE SYSTEM A SCARCITY I WOULDN'T OF HAD TO FACE THAT WOMAN DOWN AND SAY I GOT TO CHOOSE BETWEEN. THIS CHRONICALLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUAL IT'S COSTING A HOSPITAL A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND YOU WHO AREN'T -- BUT THAT'S THE DILEMMA WE FIND OURSELVES IN A STATE AND I THINK IF THIS BUDGET MOVES FORWARD AND CONTINUE TO DO THE WORK. THAT YOU'RE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO RIGHT THE LEGISLATURE WE WON'T HAVE TO FACE AS MANY OF THOSE CHOICES IN THE FUTURE. SO I REALLY GREATLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE TO FIND AS MUCH OF THIS WORK IS YOU CAN DO. ENCOURAGE MUCH OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND WITH THAT INCENTIVE FUND SO THANK YOU. THANKS TO ALL THROUGH WITH YOU FOR VERY POWERFUL TESTIMONY AYE QUICK QUESTION FOR THE MAYOR BECAUSE I KNOW YOU HAVE A A TIME. RESTRICTION -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW THE LA -- DOCTOR THAT WAS PROVIDED TO US TODAY BUT ON THE FINAL PAGE PAGE NINE THEY GAVE US A SHEET -- THAT'S AND TITLE CONVERSATIONS ON HOUSING HOMELESSNESS AND IT REALLY IS JUST KIND OF SOME BULLETS IN TERMS OF AREAS -- THAT THEY SUGGESTED WE SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT AND AND IS MORALITY KNOWLEDGE THAT MANY OF THEM ARE HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL -- REFORMING LOCAL ZONING LAWS ALTERED ALLOCATION OF LOCAL TAXES AND FOR MORNING IF YOU WOULD JUST COMMENT -- FROM A LOCAL LEADERS PERSPECTIVE -- THERE'S BEEN A PIECE OF LEGISLATION INTRODUCED HERE -- THAT AT LEAST IN MY DISTRICT WAS NOT RECEIVED WARMLY -- THAT GIVES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR AND HAVE A MORE DIRECT OVERSIGHT OVER LOCAL ZONING SO WHAT WHAT SAY YOU. ON BEHALF OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WHAT WILL ALSO BE FOR FOR STOCKTON AND START -- BECAUSE I DO THINK TO TO THE POINT LA -- REPORT TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF THE LOCAL ZONING LAWS MAKE IT DIFFICULT -- FOR LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS ACTUALLY SOMETIMES THAT SO MUCH AND STOCKTON BACK AT SEEING OTHER COMMITTEES TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND ALLOW ZONING FOR FOUR FOUR MILES AND SO I DO THINK. GIVEN THE CRISIS WERE FACING IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE STEP THE STATE TO STEP IN -- I THINK SOME OF THE THINGS THE GOVERNOR IS DOING IN TERMS OF USING A STAKE IN SOME CASES WITH CITIES TO COMPEL THEM THE BILL. TO THE CAN JUST BE A COUPLE CITIES. WHO HAVE IN MY TWO LEADERS OR WHATEVER WHO TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING PERHAPS EVERY CITY EVERY CITY EXCUSE ME HAVE TO PULL? THEIR OWN WAYS ARE FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL I THINK. WE WE WE APPRECIATE A TIMING ABILITY TO MOVE AND I THINK THAT THERE INCREASING OUR CASES OF DOLLARS TO HELP US MAKE PRODUCTS PENCIL OUT MAKES IT MUCH MORE EASIER. ON TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH WITH CONSTITUENTS BY THINK. NOT JUST IN FROM A LOCAL LEVEL BY THE STATE WE HAVE TO SOME OF ITS FOR STRIKING TO ME HOW OFTENTIMES THE ZONING LAWS HISTORICALLY AND CURRENTLY HAVE BEEN USED TO DISENFRANCHISE IN MARCH RIGHT. POOR PEOPLE PEOPLE OF COLOR EXCEPT DURING I THINK AT THE STATE WE HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AS WELL THAT IT'S IN POINTS HAVE LOCAL CONTROL LOCAL AUTONOMY. ON BUT BUT THERE THERE IS AN ISSUE WHEN I LOOK WHICH ARE A LOCAL ATTORNEY IS A POLICY WALL. IF YOU WILL THAT THE BLOCKS AND LEAVE THE SOME PEOPLE OUT. THANK YOU AND I AND I CAN I BECAUSE THE REALITY IS WE'RE ALL GOING TO DO THINGS VERY DIFFERENTLY AND AND MAKE IT REALLY TOUGH PERHAPS YOU KNOW POLITICALLY. DICEY DECISIONS CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR BASIC INCOME PROJECT THAT YOU'RE DOING AND STOCKED IN AN AND IT BECAUSE I THINK ABOUT IT AS A OUT OF THE BOX. KIND OF STRATEGY TO DEAL WITH THE CORE ISSUES WERE TRYING TO ADDRESS JAN AND I THINK A LOT OF IT WE SEE REFLECT THE IN THE EITC ECCENTRIC MENTIONED IN THE IN IN THIS BUDGET EVEN DATA DIVISION -- IDEA BUT ESSENTIALLY -- IT'S AN OLD ALMOST AS AN IDEAL MRS OF THE UNION FOR THOMAS PAINE WAS TALK ABOUT THIS IN THE LATE SEVENTEEN HUNDREDS -- DOCTOR KING -- SOCIALIST LIKE MILTON FRIEDMAN A REGION NEXEN ALSO WERE WERE FLIRTING WITH THE WITH THIS IDEA IN IN THAT PROBLEM TO TRY TO SOLVE IT I THINK WHEN YOU SINNERS MICHIGAN A WAGE IS NOT INCREASING -- WITH EVERYTHING ELSE AND IT'S IN A GREAT NATION A DESTINATION WILL NATION IS THERE ANY EXCUSE FOR PEOPLE NOT TO HAVE JUST NOT THAT LUXURIES WITH NECESSITIES TAKEN CARE OF SO WE PARTNER WITH THE GROUP CUT ECONOMIC SECURE FORTY ONE FORTY FIVE EMERGENCY. WHICH IS A RATE INCREASE IN TWO QUARTERS FOR OF FOR FOR EXAMPLE TO SEE WHAT WE LOOK LIKE TO HAVE IT -- THE IDEA WERE ABLE TO RAISE AN AWFUL IMPROPER LEASE WOULD HAVE TO USE TAXPAYER DOLLARS FOR THIS DEMONSTRATION BUT STARTING FRIDAY A HUNDRED THIRTY FAMILIES SELECTED FROM THROUGHOUT THE FOR THE CITY -- WHO ALL LIVE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS ADDER BELOW THE CITY'S MEDIAN OF FORTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS? ALSO SOME MAY BE MORE THAN THAT SOME MAKE LESS BUT THEY ALL LIVE IN NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THAT'S THE MEDIAN INCOME ARGUMENT FIVE AND DOLLARS A MONTH FOR THE NEXT -- EIGHT EIGHTEEN MONTHS IN IN AGAIN TO YOUR POINT SENATOR. THE IDEA IS NOT TO BE BOLD FOR BEING BOLD FAKE ABOUT TRANSMITTING TWO YEARS IN COMMUNITY MAYES LISTENING PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT. NOT NOT NOT SAYING I WANT TO BUY A MERCEDES BEINGS ARE WHEN THE PARK MY GOT SOMEWHERE BUT REALLY LIKE MAYOR I'M HAVING PROBLEMS WITH PAIN UTILITIES. AND I'M WORKING. I'M HAVING PROBLEM PAYING RENT AND I'M ORKING TWO JOBS I'M HAVING PROBLEM THE FOR ANY CHILD CARE AND IT'S LIKE ALL THESE FOLKS. WHO ARE NEARLY WORKING WORKING THEMSELVES TO DEATH FOURTEEN SIXTEEN HOUR DAYS I REMEMBER ONE TIME I WAS ON MY WAY TO THE AIRPORT HERE? IN MY UBER DRIVER HAD TO STOP IN CALL RANGE CHILD CARE BECAUSE SHE HAD LEFT HER CHILD AT HOME ALONE A SEVEN YEAR OLD BECAUSE SHE'S GOT THIS NOTIFICATION SHE THOUGHT. IT WOULD BE A BIG BIG TRIP ANOTHER THE TRADE OFFS THAT FOLKS THEY'RE MAKING EVERYDAY SO THAT'S WHAT KIND OF MOTIVATES THAT WORK IN BUT IS ALSO. A BELIEF IN THE EYE IN THE AGAIN TO MY EARLIER POINT THIS IDEA OF THE INHERENT DIGNITY. OF PEOPLE IN IN HUMAN BEINGS IN SOMETHING AS SMALL. AS FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH LOSING IT SINCE THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AGAIN -- COULD MAKE SUCH A MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCE WHERE PEOPLE CRYING ON FRIDAY BECAUSE THEY COULD AFFORD TO BUY THAT NEW CAR -- FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS HUNDRED OUR% RATE INCREASE IT JUST GOT THE WEEK BEFORE SO EXCITED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE NEXT EIGHTEEN MONTHS BUT REGARDS WEBS WITH THIS PROJECT I THINK THAT THE STATE WILL HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH. POVERTY AT ITS CORE BUT ALSO THE FACT THAT. WORKING POOR MOST PEOPLE OTHER PEOPLE ARE TO PAY CHECKS ONE PAYCHECK ONE LIFE INSTANT AWAY FROM BEING FOR WHEN THE FICTION AWAY. OF FOR BEING HOMES FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS NOTHING OF THE STATE THAT'S PRODUCING SO MUCH WEALTH ENGINEERING SO MANY IDEAS. ARE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY BE IT OUT LEAD THE WAY TO NATION FIGURE OUT HOW TO TAKE CARE FOLKS. ALLOW FOLKS TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES. I APPRECIATE YOU ANY QUESTIONS OF THE MAYOR BECAUSE HE HAS TO LEAVE CENTER LEYVA OF THE MAYOR. BEAUTIFUL IS NOT REALLY A QUESTION I IT'S MOSTLY STATEMENT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING I WAS YOU WERE THE REASON I CAME TO THE BUDGET HEARING TODAY NOT BECAUSE IT'S% NOT ALWAYS FASCINATING. BUT I'VE BEEN READING ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING AND I JUST THINK IT'S GREAT TO BE SO INNOVATIVE AND JUST LOOK HERE WE HAVE THIS PROBLEM WHAT HOW WE THINK OUT OF THE BOX SO I I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR THAT. I HAVE OTHER COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS BUT I WILL RESERVE THE NOTHING I WOULD SAY THAT AS A MATTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. REALLY LOOK AT IT YOU PROBABLY DO THIS IN A BECAUSE I'M A LITTLE BIT OF A ONE TRICK PONY ABOUT WAGES. AND A LOT OF TIMES BUSINESSES COME INTO CITIES AND THEY DON'T PROVIDE A LIVING WAGE AND THEN WE WONDER WHY FOLKS ARE ON WELFARE AND WHATNOT AND THEN THEY DON'T ALSO PROVIDE A PENSION AND THAT'S WHY OUR SENIORS. ARE HOMELESS SO WAGES PENSIONS WE HEAR ABOUT THEM A LOT AT THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE PROBLEM. BUT THE PROBLEM CALL FALLS TO ALL OF US IN GOVERNMENT WHEN PEOPLE DON'T MAKE A LIVING WAGE WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE A PENSION ONCE THEY GET OLDER SO THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING VERY INNOVATIVE WE APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOUS UP MISS SKINNER FOR THE MAYOR YES WITH -- SKYNYRD'S BY MAYOR CABS THANK YOU FOR REFERENCING THE COLOR OF pLAW. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT -- FOR I WOULD RECOMMEND EVERYONE READ IT'S A BRILLIANT BOOKS BY RICHARD ROTHSTEIN. AND IT'S YOU KNOW WE'RE DEALING A LOT RIGHT NOW WITHIN OUR SOCIETY AND OUR CULTURE WITH TRY WITH KIND OF LIFTING UP. LIFTING UP THE COVERS AND SEEING HOW CERTAIN POLICIES THAT SOME OF US TOOK FOR GRANTED AND HAVE FELT WERE. FOR EITHER GOOD PURPOSES OR SOMEHOW NEED TO BE PROTECTED WERE IN FACT VERY VERY EXCLUSIONARY AND RACIST IN THEIR ORIGIN AND IN VERY DELIBERATELY. SO THE THING ABOUT COLOR FLAWS THAT IT HELPS REALLY ON EARTH THE HISTORY OF HOUSING POLICY IN THE UNITED STATES. WHICH INCLUDES OWNING IT IS NOT ONLY BUT ALSO OUR LENDING POLICIES ARE EVEN THE WAY WE CONSTRUCTED. OF PUBLIC HOUSING AND HOW OF COLOR IN KIND OF PUBLIC HOUSING PEOPLE IN ANOTHER SO AND AND A CORE [inaudible] THE ZONING WAS TO EXCLUDE. LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND M. BLACK PEOPLE FROM CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS AND IF WE LOOK TODAY AT OUR NEIGHBORHOODS IT WORKED REALLY REALLY WELL. AND ANYWAY SO IT'S A GREAT BOOK THANK YOU FOR REFERENCING IT AND I RECOMMEND EVERYBODY READING IT AND TAKE YOU FOR YOUR GOOD COMMENTS AND A FOR THE BILL. THANK YOU MISTER MAYOR FOR COMING -- A LOT OF MY FORMER CONSTITUENTS IN SAN JOSE HAVE MOVED TO STOCKTON. AND WHICH MEANS THAT THE DRIVE. TO SILICON VALLEY FROM STOCKTON. IN TERMS OF THE HOUSING AND THE ENVIRONMENT IMPACTS -- EXASPERATED -- THE MAYOR OF CUPERTINO. WHERE ONE OF OUR LARGEST SINGLE EMPLOYERS -- EXISTING THEY BUILD A TWENTY THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT CIRCULAR LARGE CAMPUS COMPANY CALLED APPLE -- EXIST THERE OF SAID THAT IN HIS STATE OF THE CITY SPEECH. THAT HE WAS GONNA. BUILT A WALL AROUND CUPERTINO AND SAN JOSE WAS GOING TO PAY. FOR THAT'S WHAT HE SAID -- THE MAYOR CUPERTINO SET UP. AND IT WAS REACTION. TO THE WORK THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO TO HAVE EVERYBODY PROVIDE THEIR FAIR SHARE. OF HOUSING. SO WE'RE GETTING THAT KIND OF REACTION FROM. SOME OF THE CITY'S OUT THERE -- THE QUESTION IS WHEN WE HAVE THAT KIND OF REACTION AND WHERE THE STATE GOVERNMENT AND WE THE YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW CITIES. AND I WAS ON THE COUNCIL SAN JOSE FOR FOURTEEN YEARS. CITIES ALWAYS COME THE STATE ASKING US FOR FOR MONEY AND I THINK THE ISSUE OF THE TRANSPORTATION MONEY. CAME UP -- EARLIER. HOW DO WE GET PEOPLE LIKE HIM? TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WHAT WAS YOUR SUGGESTION BE TO DEAL WITH HOW DID YOU HOW WOULD YOU DEAL WITH THE OUT OF YOUR SITTING IN THE GOVERNOR SHOES? SAME WHEN YOU'RE ELECTED GOVERNOR DOWN THE ROAD YOU KNOW. THAT'S THE QUOTE SO NO DISRESPECT TO TO THE MAYOR CUPERTINO WHO I DON'T KNOW -- WHAT? I THINK IN THAT CASE BECAUSE IT'S FOR VALUES CONVERSATIONS I WOULD PROBABLY TALK TO I'M SURE THERE'S SOME PICO AFFILIATE IN CUPERTINO ARE NEARBY. ANSWERS SOME PASTORS AND CHURCHES I'M SURE THERE'S PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO LIVE IN CUPERTINO DON'T WIN THE CUPERTINO IN OUR PRIME LEAN HEAVILY. ON COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS HAVE CREATE PRESSURE TO MAKE COMMENTS LIKE THAT AN ACCEPTABLE BUT ALSO THE START EDUCATING THAT. BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS A VISCERAL REACTION WHEN THEY SEE HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS WERE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS LIKE NO ONE LIKES IT IT'S PEOPLE ARE UPSET THEY'RE ANGRY THEIR STRESS SOMEONE YOU'RE OFFERING. GOING ON WHEN PEOPLE SEE THAT GREAT WE GO. WOW I TALK ABOUT HUMAN BEINGS THAT HAVE TO LIVE LIKE THIS ESPECIALLY IN IN OUR SOCIETY SO I THINK. IT'S AN EDUCATION AROUND BECAUSE WE WERE BEGINNING TO THAT WERE CONSTRUCTED NOW ABOUT THIS IDEA THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING CAN BE THE BOOGIE MAN. IF WE DON'T WANT TO SEE PEOPLE ON OUR STREETS THAT FOLKS NEED TO BE ABLE FOR TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AND FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT'S A TOO MUCH ABOUT IN OUR HOME. HIM BUT THIS TIME WHO LIVE IN OUR COMMUNITY SO I THINK IT'S A I MASS EDUCATION CAMPAIGN BUT I THINK. CONCRETELY IT'S REALLY YES. ORGANIZING INCREASING PRESSURE THIS IS ACTUALLY AN UNACCEPTABLE SANTA TAKE YOUR SAY YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE LIKE ME TO LIVE IN THE CITY I LIVE IN. AND AND HELP THE MAYOR SEE THE SEE THE LIGHT ANOTHER QUESTION FOR YOU MISTER MERRETT IS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER WITHDREW THE CDG PROGRAM I THINK IT OCCURRED. RIGHT BEFORE YOU BECAME -- YOUR TENURE AS LOOKED AT FISHEL BUT I THINK THE CD BG PROGRAM WAS ONE OF THE MAIN STREAMS. FOR FUNDING FOR HOUSING RELOCATION PROGRAMS FOR SENIORS ALL THOSE. OF THIS COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT IN LOW INCOME AREAS -- USE. NOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S WITHDRAW FROM THAT AND ALL THE OTHER FEDERAL HOUSING PROGRAMS. WHAT THINGS DO YOU THINK THE STATE SHOULD DO TO STEP IN TO THE OUT LOS THE UNDERPINNING OF OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. BECAUSE WE GO TALK ABOUT THE STATE ROLE THE FEDERAL ROLE. AND THE CITY ROLE IN THE COUNTY ROLE. SO HOW HOW WOULD YOU -- HOW WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT AND DID YOU THINK THE CD BG PROGRAM WAS -- A GOOD MODEL. A LOVE SEAT CBG AND TO YOUR POINT WE NEVER HAVE ENOUGH SO AGAIN THERE'S ALL THESE GREAT PROJECTS. IN WHEN THE FROM THE MALL. AND THEY WERE IN AND ABLE TO SERVE IN TERMS OF THE STATE. I KNOW THE REVENUE PROJECTED REVENUES HAVEN'T COMING AS WE EXPECTED BUT I THINK AT SOME POINT A CONVERSATION ABOUT WE'RE DOING CANNABIS REVENUES TO GO. ON THAT'S IN LINE WITH VALUES AND PRIORITIES MAKE ME EXTREMES ARE FROM BEFORE YOU GUYS. ON BUT I WOULD SAY. THAT JUST WITH NO PRIOR RESEARCH I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE IS A NEW REVENUE STREAM IT HAS BEEN ALLOCATE TOTALLY TO ANYTHING YET TO SEE. EPIDEMIC THE NUMBER ONE CRISIS FACING THE STATE IT MAY MAKE SENSE TO DIVERSE SOME THOSE DOLLARS THERE -- FOR THAT -- AND THEN IN TERMS OF TO YOUR POINTS IN YOUR SKINNER -- ANOTHER BUT THERE REALLY ANY PASSION ABOUT THIS ISSUE WAS ABI VACATED BY MATTHEW DESMOND -- HE TALKS ABOUT HOW. HE HAS THIS PHRASE PARTICULARLY IN IN THE CONSERVE MILWAUKEE BUT HE SAYS A MILWAUKEE FOR BLACK MEN THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING LOCKED IN THE FOR BLACK WOMEN'S BEING LOCKED OUT FOR I GUESS A THIRD OF BLACK WITH MILWAUKEE HAD BEEN INFLICTED. AT SOME POINT AND I'M SURE THAT TREND SIMILAR THROUGHOUT -- SO THAT THAT THAT'S ANOTHER GREAT BUT CAN ALSO TALK ABOUT OTHER POLICY CHOICES ABOUT REQUIRE HUGE ALLOCATIONS OF MONEY THINGS LIKE I'M RIGHT TO COUNSEL FREE FICTIONS WHICH BAG OF 90% OF FOLKS WHO HAVE COUNSEL WHEN ABOUT THE VICTIM. DON'T GET EVICTEDSO I DON'T KNOW BECOME HOMELESS OVER A SECOND STOCKTON WE'RE LOOKING AT SO WHAT CAN WE DO LOCALLY. TO BEGIN POUNDING THAT BUT AND ANSWER QUESTIONS AND I THINK. CANNABIS REVENUE ARE FINDING SOME SORT OF REVENUE STREAM MET UPON STARTS WITH TECHNOLOGY THAT. THIS IS AN CLUBBING ONCE HE SAID THE PRIORITY YOU EITHER THANK YOU APPRECIATE I KNOW THAT TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. YOU KNOW -- MISTER AND SALE YOU AND THE MAYOR MADE A COMMENT ABOUT -- YOU KNOW THERE'S NO ONE THAT'S FOR HOMELESSNESS. THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING -- BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE AGAINST A NUMBER OF THE PROPOSALS TO HELP HOMELESS PEOPLE -- AND DATE. RISE UP IN THEIR VERY VOCAL -- I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO TO GO TO UTAH -- WHO ARE WAS SENT BY THE SENATE LEADER AT THE TIME TO LOOK AT THEIR MODEL? CALIFORNIA'S NOT YOU TIME CRYSTAL CLEAR ABOUT THAT. BUT WHAT I DIDN'T HEAR-- MISTER AND SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE AMAZING UNPRECEDENTED COALITION OF GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES THAT HAVE COME TOGETHER. BETWEEN THE CITY AND COUNTY AND WHAT I DIDN'T HEAR WAS PRIVATE SECTOR. SPECIFICALLY. AND WHAT I SAW ON UTAH WAS UNIQUE TO UTAH BUT IT WAS PRIVATE SECTOR CHURCH. AND ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. COOL IT WAS FASCINATING. WORD LITERALLY SPEAKING FROM THE SAME SCRIPT. SO I I AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE ARE AT A UNIQUE POINT IN TIME NOW IN CALIFORNIA WHERE MULTIPLE LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT WE WE FIGURED OUT IT IS A CRISIS WE ALL HAVE TO DO OUR PART. THE STATE HAS BEEN NEGLIGENT WE HAVE STEPPED UP IN RECENT YEARS TO DO OUR PART. WHO ARE WE MISSING IN THE PUZZLE PIECE IN TERMS OF REALLY COMING OUT WITH A CAKE THAT WITH THE? RIGHT EQUATION TO TRY TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WHO WHO WHO'S MISSING. WHAT IF IF THAT QUESTION IS IS FOR ME MADAM CHAIR AT LET ME LET ME JUST FIRST SAY THAT IF I IN ANY WAY CONVEYED? THAT THE EFFORT IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS STRICTLY WITHIN GOVERNMENT. THAT WAS NOT MY INTENTION AND THAT IS BY NO MEANS THE CASE RIGHT -- I THINK I SHARED THAT WHEN WE INITIALLY LARGE THE HOMELESS INITIATIVE -- AT THE DIRECTION THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WE UNDERTAKE EIGHTEEN POLICY SUMMITS THAT WINNER THAT BROUGHT TOGETHER FOUR HUNDRED INVITED GOVERNMENT AND COMMUNITY EXPERTS. AND OUR MOVEMENT HAS BEEN A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE COUNTY CITIES HOMELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS PHILANTHROPY. BUSINESS AND FAITH ORGANIZATIONS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING THE CONFERENCE I MENTIONED ON FEBRUARY SEVENTH THEY BROUGHT TOGETHER. EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE IN A STANDING ROOM ONLY -- CONVENE. MORE THAN HALF OF THOSE EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE NON GOVERNMENTAL PROBABLY. PROBABLY CLOSE TO TWO THIRDS WERE COMBINATION OF COMMUNITY BASED ON MY SERVICE PROVIDERS -- PHILANTHROPY -- AND FAITH ORGANIZATIONS -- SHOW. CERTAINLY IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AYE GENERATING A DEEP SENSE OF A LINE MANAGE. ACROSS THOSE SECTORS AND NOT ONLY BETWEEN THE COUNTY AND CITIES WHERE RELATIONSHIPS HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN SMOOTH IN RELATION ALMOST AS BY WITH -- PHILANTHROPY AND BUSINESS HAS BEEN FUNDAMENTAL -- IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY THE UNITED WAY OF GREATER LOS ANGELES THREE THEIR HOME FOR GOOD PROJECT WHICH WAS A PARTNERSHIP FROM THE BEGINNING. BETWEEN THE ORGANIZED CIVIC AND BUSINESS LEADERSHIP AND PHILANTHROPY HAS BEEN FUNDAMENTAL ALL ALONG AND TO DAY. THAT UNITED WAY HE IS SPEARHEADING THE EVERYONE IN CAMPAIGN WHERE EVERYONE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WHO WANTS TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. CAN SIGN UP AND A PRIMARY FOCUS OF THE EVERYONE IN CAMPAIGN IS TO SUPPORT THE CITING. THE INNER AM PERMITS SUPPORTED AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING ACROSS LOS ANGELES COUNTY. IF I COULD JUST IS FOR TO COMMENT BRIEFLY ON THE POINT I'M NOT EVERYONE'S IN AGREEMENT ON ALL OF THE SOLUTIONS -- AS I MENTIONED BEFORE I'M NO WHEN USING DIFFERENT HOMELESSNESS. I KNOW WHEN IS FOR IT. AND THAT IS INDEED A COMMON GROUND NOW THAT SAID REASONABLE PEOPLE CAN HAVE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON SOLUTIONS. AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO DEMONIZED. PEOPLE WHO ARE OPPOSED TO PARTICULAR SOLUTIONS -- AND AS WELL AS NOT TO DEMONIZED PEOPLE WHO HAVE VERY LEGITIMATE CONCERNS ABOUT THE CURRENT. REALITY IF I STILL THAT YOUNG CHILDREN AT HOME. AND THERE IS A PERSON EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THE CAR IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE -- AND PERHAPS RELIEVING HIM OR HERSELF. IN MY FRIEND YARD I WOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT -- NOW WAS THERE ANY MY PASSIONATE COMMITMENT TO COMBATING HOMELESSNESS SO I THINK THAT WHAT THE COMMON GROUND. AS HUMAN BEINGS AND WHAT WE FEEL IS THE MAYOR MENTION THIS SURVEY OF NEURAL RESPONSE AND WE SEE A FELLOW MEMBER OF OUR SPECIES SLEEPING ON THE SIDEWALK. I THINK THE COMING GROUND USE THAT BASIS FOR DEEP ALIGNMENT AND GIVES US THE ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD -- AND TO ENGAGE IN SORT OF MEANINGFUL DISCOURSE I'M AROUND A RANGE OF SOLUTIONS I WOULD ALSO SAY FINALLY ON THE QUESTION OF CITING -- GETTING INURNMENT PERMITS APARTMENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING CITED DOESN'T REQUIRE WINNING AN ELECTION AND IT ALSO DOESN'T REQUIRE A 100% -- AS THE PEOPLE TO SUPPORT A PARTICULAR PROJECT. UNITED WAY DID A POLL THAT SHOWED THAT 70% OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY RESIDENTS 70%. SUPPORT DECIDING OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD NOT IN THERE ZIP CODE. DIED IN THEIR CITY IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD. TO THE KEY AROUND CITING SO THAT THE VOICES OF THE APPRECIATE THAT. TWENTY COMMENTS -- I ADMIRE MR AND CELLS APPRECIATION FOR THE HUMAN SPECIES -- AYE AYE AYE MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE JUDGMENTAL -- HAVING HAVING WORKED IN LOTS OF COMMUNITIES WHERE WE BROUGHT FORWARD PROPOSALS WHERE. I THINK PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO HOLD COMPLETELY CONTRADICTORY IDEAS IN THEIR HEAD AT THE SAME TIME AROUND THIS TOPIC AND SO -- I GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY IS. I THINK MOST ELECTED OFFICIALS WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY DO NOT WANT THE POWER TO ZONE OR THE POWER TO APPROVE PROJECTS TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM. BUT I'VE NOTICED I PARTICIPATED IN THE CASA PROCESS THAT I THINK SOME OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH. IS THAT THE THE ELECTORATES DESIRE TO PUNISH LAWMAKERS THAT MAKE THE RIGHT MOVES AROUND THIS IS PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL. AND I ACTUALLY THINK IT WOULD BE A GREAT SERVICE TO LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS TO TAKE SOME OF THIS POWER AWAY. AND I THINK THE REASON WHY I BELIEVE THAT IS BECAUSE OF 70% OF THE ELECTORATE REALLY DOES SUPPORT PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. THE OTHER 30% IS ABUSING THE PROCESSES THAT WE HAVE. AND ERY VOCAL IN AN IN ELECTIONS. TO MAKE IT VERY VERY PAINFUL FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICES AND SO I THINK. I HEARD YOU SAY EARLIER SENATOR THAT WE'VE GOT SOME PROPOSALS THAT NOT EVERYONE IS IN AGREEMENT WITH. BUT I THINK WE'RE A LITTLE BIT PAST THE POINT OF CAN WE ALL GET THEIR COOPERATIVELY -- I WILL TELL YOU THAT WE LOST ABOUT NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ON A PROPOSAL TO BUY A MOTEL THAT HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDED FOR PURCHASE BY A LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT. BECAUSE IT WAS -- LET'S JUST SAY IT AT OUR THE CUSTOMERS -- AND WE WENT AHEAD AN OPTION THE PROPERTY AND FACED AN UNBELIEVABLE BACKLASH -- FROM FOLKS THAT DID NOT WANT TO DO IT WAS GOING TO BE HALF OF FORMALLY HOMELESS VETERANS AND HALF -- FOR I THINK FORMALLY HOMES SENIORS LIKE IF I COULD BE WRONG ABOUT THAT SECOND PIECE -- WHAT WHAT I'VE NOTICED IS REALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT WHAT -- MISTRANSLATED EARLIER ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING LOS ANGELES NOW IS IF YOU GO ON THE WEBSITE YOU CAN SEE BY EACH COUNCIL DISTRICT. WHICH OF THEM IS ACTUALLY MEETING THE GOALS IN TERMS OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IN THEIR DISTRICT AND SO WHEN WE HAVE GONE OUT TO DISTRICTS THAT. HAVE BEEN DONE A LOT OF THIS WORK WE ARE GETTING A RECEPTION IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN THE ONE WE GOT EVEN TWENTY FOUR MONTHS AGO -- IT MAY NOT ENABLE A LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIAL STAND UP TO A TOTALLY CRAZY SITUATION BUT I THINK IT. IS VERY IMPORTANT SO I THINK. YOU KNOW TO SENATOR BELLS QUESTION ABOUT CUPERTINO. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAYBE IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD IS THAT ONE OF THE REALLY POWERFUL THINGS ABOUT REDEVELOPMENT LAW. WAS IT ACTUALLYGAVE MONEY TO PURCHASE PROPERTY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. NOW A LOT OF THE MONEY THAT WE'RE SPENDING AT THE STATE LEVEL IS ACTUALLY COMING IN THE FORM OF GAP FUNNY THAT COMES AFTER YOU MADE THE PURCHASE RIGHT. AND SO I THINK THE CHALLENGE FOR THE CUPERTINO IS OF THE WORLD AND YOU SORT OF CONSTRUED TRUST IT WOULD STOCKTON I THINK. WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO GIVE MAYOR TUBS OF MONEY -- TO TO ARE UNFORTUNATELY A BUNCH OF VERY JOBS RICH COMMUNITIES OUR STATE WHERE IF YOU GIVEN THE MONEY THEY'RE GOING TO DO ANYTHING WITH IT. AND SO I THINK THE QUESTION FOR YOU IS LEGISLATORS IS AT WHAT POINT DO PEOPLE LOSE THE RIGHT. TO PROCEED AT THEIR OWN PACE AT FOR ME WAS ABOUT A DECADE AGO -- I SENSE THAT NOW IS THE MOMENT FOR MANY OTHERS. AND AND I GUESS I WOULD JUST SAY I THINK I THINK THAT I I RECENTLY HEARD AN ELECTED OFFICIAL TALK ABOUT IS I CAN'T REMEMBER WHO IT IS BUT JUST LIKE WE DO ON EVERY OTHER TOPIC WE HAVE. A STANDARD OF CIVIC BEHAVIOR THAT WE EXPECT OUT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND AND FRANKLY IF PART OF IT IS ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOUSING SHORTAGE THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE. THAN THERE OUGHT TO BE A SERIES OF BEHAVIORS THAT WE EXPECT A LOW COLLECTED OFFICIALS WERE APPOINTED OFFICIALS OR WHATEVER IT IS. TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THOSE THINGS AND IF THEY CAN'T OR WON'T -- I I THINK IT IS TIME FOR THE STATE TO ACT AND REMOVE SOME OF THOSE SOME OF THOSE OF THIRTIES AND I AND HONESTLY I THINK. IT WILL BE TO THE BENEFIT OF MANY LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO ARE OTHERWISE PUTTING COMPLETELY UNTENABLE SITUATIONS AND WHO BEHIND CLOSED DOORS WILL TELL YOU. I'M TOTALLY FOR YOUR PROJECT I AM TOTALLY THE PUBLIC HAS SPOKEN AND YOU'VE GOTTEN THROUGH SEQUEL AND ALL THE LAWSUITS ARE OVER I'M GONNA COME OUT FOR IT. BUT THAT'S TOO LATE TO THANK YOU SENATOR BILL [inaudible] THANK -- THE MAKING SOME GOOD POINTS HERE AND I WAS COMPELLED BY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT RAPID RE HOUSING. THERE WERE MANY IMPEDIMENTS TO THAT. IS THERE ANY HOPE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. FOR FASTRACK PERMITTING OR CONSOLIDATED PERMITTING THE THAT WOULD BE AN ELEMENT OF HELPING WITH YOUR FAST TRACKING WOULD NOT. SO I AM CENTER THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION THAT. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT CHAIR BIG KNOWLEDGE THAT. WITH THE PARTIAL EXCEPTION OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. THE VAST MAJORITY OF FAMILIES AND ADULTS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. WILL ESCAPE HOMELESSNESS NOT BY MOVING INTO NEWLY BUILT HOUSING. THEY WILL MOVE INTO ALREADY EXISTING HOUSING. AND THEY WILL NEED A RENTAL SUBSIDY TO DO IT NOW THAT SAID. THE ABBOTT THEY SHOULD THE DEEP SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE STATE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND UNIT SHORTFALL IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY ALONE. IS THE GROUND OF OUR HOMELESS CRISIS THAT'S WHAT'S CAUSING RENTS TO GO UP. AND RATES GOING UP IS WHAT'S CAUSING PEOPLE TO BECOME. I IN NO WAY WANT TO MINIMIZE THE FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE OF INCREASING HOUSING SUPPLY. AND POTENTIALLY TAKING OTHER POLICY ACTIONS TO MITIGATE RENT INCREASES. BY. THAT SAID THERE IS NOT THE LINEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN. A FAMILY OR DAHLE HE'S HOMELESS TODAY. AND MOVING INTO A NEWLY BUILT UNIT TOMORROW IT'S MORE OF THESE INDIRECT RELATIONSHIP IN TERMS OF THE MARKET DYNAMIC OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND ITS IMPACT ON RENTS. SO THAT SAID -- THE KEY TO MOVING FAMILIES AND ADULTS IN TWO IN A RAPID RE HOUSING PROGRAM IS LOCATING THE AVAILABLE UNITS -- AND THE FACT THAT THE HOUSING MARKET IS SO TIGHT IS THE BIGGEST IMPEDIMENT TO THAT NOW THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXAMPLE THROUGH INCREASING ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS. IS AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY. TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THAT'S AN AREA WHERE WE ARE FOCUSING -- QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY ON YOUR VERY SPECIFIC QUESTION ABOUT PERMITTING THAT IS PRIMARILY A CITY RESPONSIBILITY I'M IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY 90%. OF OUR COUNTY RESIDENTS LIVE IN ONE OF OUR EIGHTY EIGHT INCORPORATED CITIES EIGHTIES EACH OF THOSE EIGHTY EIGHT CITIES TO THEIR CITY COUNCILS. AND SEE MANAGERS AND DAD PLANNING COMMISSIONS THAT MAKE THE DECISIONS -- AROUND PER MEETING AT YOUR PROJECTS EITHER BY RIGHT OR ON A DISCRETIONARY BASIS. ONE OF THE INTERESTING. OBSERVATIONS THAT I'VE HAD OVER MANY DECADES AND MISTER SHOEMAKER SOMEWHAT [inaudible] NOTED THAT. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE LONG COMPLAINED. ABOUT STATE MANDATES. PARTICULAR UNFUNDED MANDATES. BUT I FOUND OUT MANY YEARS AGO THAT SOME OF THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. SILENTLY REALLY LIKED THOSE. MANDATES. BECAUSE IT GOT THEM OFF THE HOOK. WELL I GET THAT. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THAT HAD WE WALK A MIDDLE GROUND NOW. TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE PRESSURES ON THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. BUT ALSO THEN TO ENCOURAGE DECISION MAKING. AND GETTING THE JOB DONE IT'S JUST A IT'S BEEN A PARADOX THAT'S BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME. THEN WILL THE LEGISLATURE ONE OF THIS FILM WITH THAT BURDEN WEALTH IT SEEMS LIKE IT HAS FOR OVER A LONG TIME BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE ANSWER IN THE FUTURE FOR THE STATE TO SUE MORE. RESPONSIBILITYOF LAW FOR THEM TO TO COMMENT ON THAT. YEAH YEAH. I I KIND OF MOVED OFF ON TO THAT YET NO I APPRECIATE THE THE THE COMMON SENATOR I I GUESS I WOULD SAY -- IN SOME WAYS I DON'T KNOW THE YOU'RE TAKING ON MORE THAN MANDATE AS MUCH AS JUST -- TECHNOLOGY THAT THERE ARE ASPECTS OF OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS TO DON'T WORK VERY WELL. AND SO TO HAVE DIRECT DEMOCRACY OR SOMETHING APPROACHING IT. BE THE RULE OF THE DAY FOR THE APPROVAL OF INDIVIDUAL HOUSING DEVELOPMENT SEEMS LIKE A BAD. UNDERSTANDING OF OUR OUR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM AND WE'VE GOT REPRESENTED DEMOCRACY FOR A REASON. BUT WHEN IT COMES A LAND USE DECISIONS IT'S IF WE DO A PLEBISCITE ON EVERY PROJECTAND AND SO I WOULD SAY IT'S ACTUALLY MORE. AT A KNOWLEDGE IN THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN SEE THAT. OUR SYSTEM FOR MAKING DECISIONS WHEN WE HAVE AN OVERWHELMING NEED TO MAKE THEM. IS NOT OCCURRING WITH THE TOOLS THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US OF THE PROCESS EITHER WE HAVE SET UP AND SO. I DON'T THINK YOU'D BE TAKING ON AS MUCH AS ACKNOWLEDGING THAT WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT TOO FAR IN TERMS OF PROCESS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. AT THIS WRESTLING OTHER POINT IN A WHEREVER YOU'RE GOING TO LOCATE. AN SHELTER FOR HOMELESS PERSON. WHAT ARE YOUR OPTIONS ARE THE? CONSIDERABLE FOR HAVING THOSE LOCATIONS BE WITH NEXUS. TO TREATMENT MEDICAL CARE. EDUCATION. ALL THOSE. THAT TO THEM PORTENT PART OF GETTING SOMEONE PERMANENTLY OFF. THE THE SO CALLED TREADMILL OF HOMELESSNESS. CHOOSE SENATOR -- PRIOR TO YOU ARE THE ONES WHO ARE HOMELESS INITIATIVE IN. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN MOST PUBLICLY FUNDED -- EMERGENCY SHELTER IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WHICH ONLY OPEN FOURTEEN HOURS A DAY. SO THE RESIDENTS HAD TO LIGHT AT BEACH DAY NIGHT. WE CHANGE THAT SAY NOW ALL PUBLICLY FUNDED INTERN HAS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS OPEN TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY. AND THEREFORE FUNCTIONS AS A PLATFORM FOR ACCESS TO SERVICES AND PERMANENT HOUSING THE AS LONG AS IN ROOM HOUSING IS ACCESSIBLE VIA PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. I WOULD SAY GENERALLY THAT IT WOULD BE -- AFIQ COULD BE A FEASIBLE LOCATION IN TERMS OF MEETING THE SERVICE NEEDS THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY THERE. IS THAT. HOMELESS PEOPLE ARE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THEIR LIVES IS RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER PEOPLE. JUST LIKE FOR ALL OF US. AND FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. GENERALLY. THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT MANY OF US TAKE FOR GRANTED. ARE DEEPLY FRAYED OR NO LONGER EXIST PARTICULARLY RELATIONSHIPS WITH FAMILY [inaudible] AND WHAT WE FIND IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ARE MORE LIKELY. TO BE LONG TERM LOS ANGELES COUNTY RESIDENTS THAN PEOPLE WHO ARE HOUSED. THE DESPITE THE MINUTE THE PEOPLE COME TO SANTEE CALIFORNIA. PARTICULARLY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE WEATHER IS GOOD -- PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THE DATA SHOWS THAT THAT IS NOT TRUE AND THEN IN FACT THREE QUARTERS. OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY HAVE LIVED IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS MANY FOR THEIR ENTIRE LIVES. AND THEREFORE THE KEY QUESTION FOR US AROUND CITING IN ROOM HOUSING S LESS ABOUT ACCESS TO SERVICES AND MORE ABOUT BEING IN THE COMMUNITIES WHERE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. ARE HOMELESS AND THEREFORE WILL BE WILL GO BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULD RATHER SLEEP ON THE STREET. IN THE COMMUNITY THEY KNOW WHERE THEY GO GO TWENTY MILES AWAY TO AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT -- COMMUNITY SO THAT'S WHY IT'S WHICH CRITICAL TO DISTRIBUTE IN ARM HOUSING -- RALLY IN A WAY THAT'S ROUGHLY PROPORTIONATE TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS BUT THAT SAID. IF THERE'S A CITED SOME PUBLIC TRANSIT IN A COMMUNITY WHERE PEOPLE THERE IS A COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE EXPANSION ALMOST AS THE NEEDS THAT INNER HOUSING. THAT WE WOULD CONSIDER THAT -- A VIABLE SITE NOW I ONE ALSO JUST CRIED FRIENDS BEGIN FOR WORK. ONE OF THE LARGEST URBAN AREAS IN THE COUNTRY THE LARGEST IN CALIFORNIA I THINK IN A RURAL COMMUNITY -- THE ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION MIGHT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT AROUND THE QUESTION OF THE LOCATION OF INNER MAY HAVE SEEN. THE OTHER RELATED SERVICES THANK YOU. THIRD OR MORE LOCK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MISTER SHOEMAKER -- MISTER ANSEL'S USE THE WORD CITING QUITE A BIT THE USE AN IMPORTANT WORD THAT WAS SCARCITY. SO I WANNA. ASK YOU THREE QUESTIONS THE FIRST IS WHERE AND HOW ARE YOU FINDING LAND -- YOU'VE ALREADY KIND OF HINTED AT NIMBY ISM -- BUT I I WANNA KNOW HOW YOU'RE MAKING GET PENCIL OUT AND WOULD YOU CONCLUDE WITH A SUCCESS STORY. HER I THINK I WANNA MAKE SURE I UNDERSTOOD THE SECOND QUESTION ARE WE MAKING A PENCIL -- IN TERMS OF OPPOSITION OR JUST IN TERMS ARE JUST AS A FINANCIALLY YEAH HOW DOES IT ALL WORK IS REALLY HARKING ABOUT SERIOUS COST YEAH YEAH -- YOU KNOW I HONESTLY MERCY HOUSING MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT UNUSUAL IN THE SENSE THAT WE ARE -- OUR ROOTS ARE OBVIOUSLY WITH CATHOLIC SISTERS AND WE HAVE A LOT OF RELATIONSHIPS WITH FACE BATES ORGANIZATION SO AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF PROPERTIES COME OUR WAY VIA A CHURCHES. AND OTHER RELIGIOUS GROUPS SYNAGOGUES COME TO US THAT WAY US OF A LOT OF SOCIAL SERVICE NONPROFIT TO COME FORWARD. THAT YOU KNOW MIGHT WORK WITH AUTISTIC. A YOUNG ADULT AND SAY LIKE RICHARD WERE DYING TO SERVE THIS POPULATION WILL HELP US BUILD SOME HOUSING FOR AND WE GOTSOME LAND TO DO IT -- WE WE ALSO ARE LUCKY TO WORK WITH A LOT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DO GREAT WORK -- WE HAD A COUPLE OF AMAZING EXPERIENCES IN LA COUNTY WITH A MONTY -- THAT YOU KNOW. IT OUT ALL THE THE THE SMALLER PIECES OF LAND IN THEIR JURISDICTION. AND HAVE -- AND MAYBE I'M NOT ENDING WITH A SUCCESS STARTED I'LL JUST SAY THAT THE TIME FROM WHICH A MONTY DECIDED TO MOVE ON TO ME TO THE TIME WHICH HAD A PERMIT AND ALL THE MONEY TO GO. WAS YOU KNOW. THE QUESTION A MONTHS NOT YEARS -- AND WE HAVE NOW WE'RE NOW BUILDING OUR SECOND -- DEVELOPMENT THERE -- FOR FORMALLY HOMES THAT -- AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE A LOT A GOVERNMENT'S THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE MOVING FORWARD ON SURPLUS PROPERTY WHEN YOU WANT TO DO WHAT YOU CAN DO IT -- AND THEN OCCASIONALLY WE DO WE DO PURCHASE PROPERTY WE'D WE DO -- ESPECIALLY AROUND BERMAN SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. ACQUIRE HOTELS AND MOTELS OFTEN BECAUSE FASTER WAY TO GET TO THE FINISH LINE ON ON THOSE TYPES OF ISSUES -- IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE PERFECT PLACE FOR SOMETHING BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S ONE OF THE THE ONE OF THE WAYS WE DO IT -- AND YOU KNOW AND OCCASIONALLY GO OUT AND IF WE'RE REALLY ANXIOUS TO GET SOMETHING IN A PARTICULAR COMMUNITY WILL GO AHEAD AND AND WORK WITH A BROKER IN TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO PURGE THE LAND. ON IN YOU KNOW IN DIFFERENT DEVELOPERS WORK DIFFERENTLY IN THAT REGARD I THINK WE'RE PROBABLY MORE ON THE RELATIONSHIP SIDE A LITTLE BIT LESS ON THE REAL ESTATE BROKERS AND SOME OTHERS -- IN TERMS OF PENCILING IT OUT I I THINK THIS IS -- IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO KNOW WHICH IS I THINK AT THIS POINT IN A MAYBE FOR THIS BEFORE MOST AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS OF THE STATE HAVE TO GO TO SEVEN OR EIGHT DIFFERENT SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR ITS DEVELOPMENT. AND EACH ONE HAS SOMETHING SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT. YOUR YOUR MANDATE IS THAT MY BUILDING BE BLUE. AND YEARS IS THAT IT ALSO BE BANK AND SO I'VE GOT TO FIND SOMETHING THAT'S BLUE AND PINK IN ORDER TO GET IT DONE. AND I THINK THAT -- THE FEWER SOURCES OF FUNDING WE USE FOR EACH PROJECT THE BETTER OFF WE BE CITING ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. IS A LITTLE BIT OF A I DON'T USE MY WORDS HERE CAREFULLY BUT A LITTLE BIT DISCONCERTING ABOUT THE WAY WE TEND OF FUND MONEY OR FUND. DEVELOPMENT AS WE WE SORT OF TRY AND PILE THE SMALLEST AMOUNT POSSIBLE FROM ONE SOURCE TO LEVERAGE ANOTHER IN THE LEVERAGE ANOTHER WHEN IN FACT I THINK. WOULD BE IN THE STATE'S INTEREST TO SORT OF SAY LET'S MAKE THE FUNDING AWARDS FOR EACH OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS. TWICE AS BIG ARE THREE TIMES AS BIG SO YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO GO TO THE STATE FOR LOTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF FUNDS. AND THEN LOTS OF DIFFERENT REGIONAL GROUP FOR THAT AS I BOB BY LAND I GET LAND FROM A LOCAL GOVERNMENT. I GET SOME MONEY FROM THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AS WELL TO KIND OF DO THE DESIGN SEARCHES AND I GOT A ONE SOURCE AT THE STATE LEVEL. TO MAKE IT WOK -- OFTENTIMES THAT'S NOT THE CASE AND SO I THINK THAT WOULD MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE AND I THINK. AS A LEGISLATURE THINGS ABOUT THE USE OF ITS MONEY IT'S SORT OF TEMPTING TO SORT OF SAY LET'S. LET'S SPREAD THIS EVERYWHERE SHOULD BE SURE THAT WE HAD EVERY COMMUNITY WHEN IN FACT YOU CAN HIT EVERY COMMUNITY BUT YOU JUST. WOULD BE BETTER IF YOU MAY THE WARTS FROM EACH PROGRAM SLIGHTLY BIGGER SO I WILL I WILL SAY THAT -- AND I GUESS I WOULD JUST SAY LIKE I YOU KNOW AGAIN BACK TO A MONTY I I'M AMAZED AT THE RECEPTION WE GOT THERE IS PROBABLY FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO BUT I CAME IN WITH A COUPLE OF OTHER FOLKS -- WHO HAVE BEEN IN THIS FIELD FOR FORTY YEARS -- I'VE NEVER SEEN A RECEPTION LIKE THAT AND I LITTLE OURSELVES -- LITERALLY THE ENTIRE DOWNTOWN WAS STOPPED. IT FELT LIKE EVERY ELECTED OFFICIAL IN EVERY VETERANS OF ANY WAR OR ANY WANTED EVER SERVE IN THE MILITARY WAS THERE. MANY OF THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AROUND ON MONTY WHERE THEY'RE AND THEY'RE ASKING HOW DID YOU GET THIS DONNA HOW DO WE DO IT AGAIN -- AND THE GOOD NEWS FOR US IS SOME OF THOSE FOLKS OF THEN GOT CALLED US UP AND SAID FROM PLACENTIA OR NORWALK OR WHATEVER IT IS. I SAW THE PROJECT YOU DIDN'T AMOUNT TO COME INTO THAT OUR COMMUNITY AND I KNOW MERCY IS NOT ALONE IN HAVING I THINK YOU KNOW THE BEST ADVERTISEMENT FOR ANOTHER. OPPORTUNITY IS TO REALLY DO GREAT WORK AND TO WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY SO. I THINK THERE ARE LOTS OF PLACES LIKE THAT THAT ARE JUST. THEY'RE STEPPING UP IN A YOU KNOW WE LITERALLY HAVE TO TURN AWAY DONORSOF FOOD FOR OUR VETERANS HOUSING DEVELOPMENT ON MULTI. BECAUSE THE COMMUNITY SUPPORT IS SO OVERWHELMING PEOPLE ARE CONSTANTLY COMING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OFFERING TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FOOD -- YOU KNOW IN AN EFFORT TO HELP THE FORMALLY ALMOST THAT SO I THINK YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE AND YOU KNOW I I THINK THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER COMMUNITIES LIKE THAT SO. I WANTED TO I WANT JUST TO FOLKS THAT AREN'T ARE DOING GREAT WORK I MEAN THERE ARE SOME AMAZING AMAZING -- LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS ALLOW WAIT. YOUR SUCCESSES LIKE IN EL MONTE BE YOUR ANTIDOTE. TO DOING SOMETHING SOMEWHERE ELSE TO SAY. IN YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A NAME BE EXPERTS YOU'LL HAVE TO BRING THE TORCHES AND PITCHFORKS BECAUSE WE'VE DONE IS AN ILL MONEY. AND IT'S IT'S A WIN WIN WIN. AND IS AT A WAY TO INOCULATE. THE RESIDENTS OF THE NEIGHBORING CITY YOU KNOW IT IS REALLY EFFECTIVE WHEN YOU CAN GET FOLKS TO DO IT -- AND UNFORTUNATELY -- AN ERA IN WHICH THE INTERNET IS THE SOURCE OF A LOT OF INFORMATION -- WEEK WE TRY VERY HARD TO GET FOLKS TO COME AND VISIT WITH OTHER FOLKS ARE TALK TO PEOPLE THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE THAT. I HAVE NEVER HAD THE EXPERIENCE PERSONALLY OF OF NEIGHBORS COMING UP TO ME AFTER BUILDING IS IN PRICE AND IN OPERATIONS AND SAYING I TOLD YOU WAS GOING TO BE AWFUL. I GET THE OPPOSITE EVERY TIME WHICH IS GREAT I I YOU KNOW I WAS SUPER NERVOUS ABOUT THIS I REALLY DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU WHEN YOU TELL ME WAS GONNA BE OKAY AND IT IS. I'M A LITTLE EMBARRASSED INSTAGRAM THAT I'VE FOUGHT TO BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I REALLY SUPPORT THIS NOW AND I WISH I'D KNOWN WHAT I KNOW NOW. BUT IT'S HARD TO GET THAT OUT TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU LIKE BUT IT'S IT IS EXPERIENCE I THINK OF MANY. IF NOT MOST OF US IN THIS FIELD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MANAGER. I'M ON THAT QUESTION OR OVERALL A RECALL BRIEFLY BEFORE YES IF I COULD THERE. THE AND AGAIN. I TALK ABOUT ME ABOUT ABOUT MY QUESTION. IF I COULD THERE'S TWO POINTS I'D LIKE TO RAISE THAT AT THAT HAVE BEEN SERVICE YET -- FIRST ON THE QUESTION OF THIS HOUSING CONSTRUCTION I DO WANT TO SHARE THAT IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. THERE IS ENORMOUS INTEREST IN INNOVATIVE APPROACHES. TO BUILDING -- HOUSING FOR FAMILIES AND ADULTS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS TIMES ON TUESDAY IN THE PRINT EDITION. IN THAT CALIFORNIA'S SECTION WAS DEDICATED TO OUR HOUSING INNOVATION CHALLENGE WHERE WE UTILIZED FOR A HALF MILLION DOLLARS A MEASURE H. FUNDING FOR FIVE VERY INNOVATIVE NON TAX CREDIT PROJECT PROJECTS. WHICH HAVE THE POTENTIAL -- TO BE SCALED TWO HUNDREDS OR EVEN THOUSANDS OF UNITS BEING BUILT AND RELYING ON OUR EXPERIENCE THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES HAS ALLOCATED. A FULL 10% OR A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS OF THEIR ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS -- LAB PROPOSITION TRIPLE H. HOUSING BOND FINDING 80% OF WHICH HAS TO BE FOR PERMITS A PART OF HOUSING -- TO AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH SHE DOESN'T EXPLICIT DOESN'T. EXCLUDES TAX CREDIT FINANCING BY IT IS INTENDED TO BE A FASTER AND CHEAPER APPROACH WHICH COULD INCLUDE NON TAX CREDIT ARE PROJECTS AND SIMILARLY THE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. IS PUTTING TWELVE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS IN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FINDING INTO AN INNOVATIVE -- PROPOSAL PROCESS SO I JUST WANT TO PUT OUT THAT THERE IS A LOT OF FERMENT AND INTEREST. IN ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO BUILD HOUSING FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS BOTH ALTERNATIVE CONSTRUCTION METHODS. AND ALTERNATIVE FINANCING METHODS AN ALTERNATE CONSTRUCTION METHODS ARE NOT EXCLUDED FROM TAX CREDIT FINANCING WHETHER IT'S PRETTY FABRICANT TRAINER OR OTHER ALTERNATIVE METHODS BUT I JUST WANTED TO INTERJECT THAT. I INTO THE CONVERSATION AND THEN FINALLY JUST TO TIED DOWN TO A CENTER MORE LAX -- QUESTION. RELATIVE TO CITIES WHICH AGAIN MAKE THE LAND USE DECISIONS IN IN THE IN OUR STATE ARE CURRENTLY -- ENABLING CITIES TO MOVE TOGETHER. RATHER THAN SEPARATELY IS IN OUR VIEW AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE SOLUTION AND WE HAVE BEEN VERY INTENTIONAL ABOUT ENGAGING THE EIGHTY EIGHT CITIES. IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. IN. TRYING TO MOVE. TOGETHER MEANING TO GO ON THE SAME TIME LINE THAT YOU DO SIMILAR THINGS SAY WHEN WE ENGAGE FORTY ONE CITIES TO WANTED TO DEVELOP CITY SPECIFIC HONEST AS PLANS HE WAS ON THE SAME TIME LINE. AND THEN WE ALLOCATED NINE MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT CITIES ARE COMPETITIVE PROCESS IN IMPLEMENTING THOSE PLANS. SO. THE INTENTION OF DOING THAT IS THAT CITIES ARE AFRAID OF BEING MAGNETS. I'VE DRAIN PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS FROM SURROUNDING COMMITTEE COMMUNITIES. IF CITIES MOVE IN PARALLEL NOT THE SAME IF THEY'RE MOVING TO GATHER IN A CONSTRUCTIVE DIRECTION THEN THEY CAN OVERCOME% THAT FEAR. OF BEING A MAGNET -- AND WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT THAT'S VERY POSITIVE THAT DYNAMIC AND WE IN FACT ARE SUPPORTING. THE SEVEN COUNCILS OF GOVERNMENT IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WITH ONGOING FINDING ESSENTIALLY FOR HOMELESS COORDINATORS WITHIN THE COGS WHOSE JOB IT IS TO SUPPORT. THE CITIES IN THEIR GEOGRAPHIC AREAS IN COORDINATING THEIR EFFORTS SO IN THIS NINE MILLION DOLLARS I MENTIONED WE HAVE MANY CITIES. THAT FOR EXAMPLE MANHATTAN BEACH REDONDO BEACH AND HERMOSA BEACH. AFFLUENT BEACH CITIES IN -- NORTH OF LONG BEACH AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY WHO CAME TOGETHER TO SEE FINDING YOUR SUPPORT IMPLEMENTATION OF THEIR HOMELESSNESS PLANS SIMILARLY WE IN THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY WHICH IS WHERE I MONEY IS LOCATED AT THE HEARD MENTION OF A MOMENT AGO. COMING TOGETHER SO I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE IS THAT IN ADDITION TO ANY ACTIONS THAT. THE LEGISLATURE IN ADMINISTRATION MIGHT TAKE AROUND CITY RESPONSES CITY DISCRETION OR CARRIAGE OR STYX'S SATIATED WITH THE EXERCISES CITY AUTHORITY. I WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT THINGS YOU COULD DO THAT WOULD. ENCOURAGE CITIES TO WORK TOGETHER. AND TO WORK TOGETHER. SIMULTANEOUSLY -- BECAUSE I HI IN ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE PARTICULAR AROUND AND USE. WITH THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH HAS BEEN A VERY ENGAGING PAL WE APPRECIATE YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. AS THE FINAL PANEL APPROACH TO THEM AND COURAGE ALL MY COLLEAGUES TO STAND UP AND STRETCH. THIS IS A SHORT RECESS BREAK. BEFORE THE NEXT PANEL COMES FORWARD. REPORTER. AND I THINK YOU KNOW WHILE. WE TALKED ABOUT. COLOR OF LAW AND THE FACT THAT THOSE ARE STILL VERY RECENT LAWS THAT. WERE ON THE BOOKS WHAT WE DIDN'T REALLY TALK ABOUT WAS THE ROLE WE TALKED ABOUT NIMBIS WILL WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THE ROLE. BIAS IMPLICIT IN OTHERWISE. PLAYS AS AN ADDITIONAL LAYER INTO HOW PEOPLE RESPOND TO THE HOMELESS POPULATION THAT WE ALL. ACCORDING TO THE MAYOR HAVE THIS OR RESPONSE TO BUT WHEN PEOPLE DON'T LOOK LIKE YOU AND YOU KERRY AN INTERNAL BIAS HOW THAT ALSO COMPLICATE YOUR ABILITY. TO BE OPEN -- TO THERE IS HOUSING OPTIONS AND I DO THINK THAT WAS IT. THE THING WE TALK ABOUT EXPLICITLY BUT IT CAN'T BE IGNORED. EVERYBODY TAKING THEIR STRETCH RECESS BRIGHT [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] REFER [inaudible] I APPRECIATE. THE STATE RESPONSE RECENT ACTIONS IN IMPLEMENTING NEW PROGRAMS PANEL -- FOR ALLOWING ME TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS -- TO THE AGENDA. AND WERE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR HOUSING POLICY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING COMMITTEE DEVELOPMENT ZACH HOMESTAND.

START WITH THAT. SO MANY ASPECTS OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN HOUSING PACKAGE AS WELL SOME LEGISLATION LAST YEAR'S COME TO ON MY DIVISION FOR IMPLEMENTATION. TODAY I'M GONNA SPEAK ABOUT -- SPECIFICALLY THE PLANNING GRANTS THAT WERE PART OF SB TO THE BUILDING HOMES AND JOBS ACT WHICH I AS YOU ALL KNOW CREATED AN ONGOING REVENUE SOURCE FOR THE STATE. 250% OF THE FIRST YEAR'S RUNNER REVENUES GENERATED LAST YEAR WHEN SPECIFICALLY FOR PLANNING GRANTS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COMBINED -- THAT HALF IS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO MILLION AVAILABLE AS OF FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH WE ARE STILL. WAITING FOR THE FINAL REVENUES A TRICK ONE FROM TWENTY SEVEN SR TWENTY EIGHTEEN FOR SB TO FOR ABOUT ABOUT. TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION RIGHT NOW. THE PLAN GRANTS ARE TO BE USED TO HELP CITIES AND COUNTIES UPDATE PLANNING DOCUMENTS AND ZONING ORDINANCES SO SOME YOUR QUESTIONS EARLIER HOPEFULLY THIS'LL AT SOME CLARITY -- THAT CAME UP TO ALSO BE USED TO IMPLEMENT PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS TO STREAMLINE HOUSING APPROVALS AND ACCELERATE HOUSING PRODUCTION. FACILITY HOUSING AFFORDABILITY PARTICULAR FOR LOWER AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND PROMOTE DEVELOP A CONSISTENT WITH CITY PLANNING -- PRIORITIES. THESE GRANTS EIGHT MONTH OVER THE COUNTER PROCESS. TO JURISDICTIONS TO ONE HAVE A H. E. APPROVED VALID HOUSING ELEMENT COMPLAIN HOUSING ELEMENT HAVE SUBMITTED A RECENT ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT TO THE STATE. DEMONSTRATE THE PROPOSED ACTIVITY HAS A NEXUS TO ACCELERATE HOUSING PRODUCTION. AND OF COURSE ARE CONSISTENT WITH STATE HOUSING LAN PARTIES. WE ISSUED OUR GUIDELINES OUR FINAL GUIDELINES FOR THESE PLANNING GRANTS IN DECEMBER AND WE PLAN ON ISSUING THE NOTICE THE FUNDING BILL AVAILABILITY AT THE END OF NEXT MONTH.

SO -- MARKS I RESERVE MY COLLEAGUE FROM OUR TO BE I'M HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE EIGHT SOME I'M GOOD AFTERNOON A MARKS DIVERS ON THE ACTING DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE OF THE DIVISION EACH CITY THAT PUTS OUT MOST THE LOAN AND GRANT PROGRAMS. THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY TO DILIGENTLY TO IMPLEMENT THE HOUSING PACKAGE OF MEASURES FROM TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AS WELL AS THE BONDS THAT WERE APPROVED BY THE VOTERS IN THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR -- I'M GONNA START A LITTLE BIT WITH THE SB TWO PROGRAMS -- BECAUSE THAT SORT OF OVER THE WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON MOST CURRENTLY SO AS TO AS ACT MENTIONED THE SB TO PROGRAM TWENTY FIRST YOUR COMPONENT. AND 50% OF THAT MONEY WENT TO TO PROGRAMS THAT WE ARE MINISTERING THE FIRST -- IS THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS AND HOUSING PROGRAM IT GETS HALF OF THAT MONEY SO -- IS GEARED TOWARDS HOMELESSNESS AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER IN MANY OF THE PRESENTATIONS IT'S A FLEXIBLE SOURCE. TO TO COUNTIES THROUGH ENTITIES DESIGNATED BY THE CONTINUUM OF CARE TO SPEND ON THE STRATEGIES PRIORITIES THAT THEY HAVE IT CAN BE FROM RAPID RE HOUSING TO ADD NAVIGATION SHELTERS TO PERMANENT HOUSING AS THE SORT OF HOW THEY SEE FIT. AYE WE'VE ALREADY GRANTED THE FIRST. ROUND OF FUNDING TO EVERY SINGLE COMMUTE KING A CONTINUED KERR DID APPLY AND WE GIVE GRANTS TO EACH. ONE WITH A TOTAL OF FIFTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS. WE ADDED SO THE SOME OF THAT MONEY WAS NOT SB. SO WITH A LITTLE BIT BIGGER IN THAT FIRST ROUND THAT IT WILL BE IN THE SECOND ROUND BUT NONE THE LESS WE AND WE WILL HAVE A SECOND ROUND IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR THAT'S ROUTE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. AGAIN EACH CONTINUE OF CARE DID RECEIVE THEIR FIRST ROUND GRANTS WERE EXPECTS TO USE THE APPLICATION FROM EACH CONTAINING OF CARE IN THE SECOND ROUND. BUT THAT IS A ONE TIME WHEN YOUR PROGRAM -- THE SECOND TRANCHE OF SB TWO FUND'S OF WEIRD MINISTERING IS -- WAS TESTED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO PROGRAM CALLED THE HEALTHY HOUSING FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIANS. IN THE IDEA OF THIS PROGRAM REALLY IS. TO BUILD SUPPORT PRESS FOR HOUSING FOR FOLKS ON MEDICARE WHO ARE VERY FREQUENT USERS THESE ARE THE FOLKS WHO COST THE STATE AND COUNTY THE MOST DOLLARS A MEDICAL HEALTH CARE. VARIOUS STUDIES SHOW THAT IF YOU HOUSE FOLKS IT'S ACTUALLY CHEAPER TO HOUSE FOLKS THEN IT'S KEEP PROVIDING THIS LEVEL OF SORT OF MERGING TO CARE ON AN ONGOING BASIS -- SO WE WILL HAVE -- FOR THIS YEAR ABOUT NINETY SIX MILLION DOLLARS ABOUT SIXTY THAT FROM THE SB TO FUNDS. THIRTY SIX MILLION OF THAT FROM THE NATIONAL HOUSING TRUST FUND RICHER FEDERAL FUNDS COMING TO CALIFORNIA. A AND THAT WILL GO OUT -- IN -- MARCH WITH A NOTICE OF FUNDING AVAILABILITY. AND IT AGAIN THAT THAT MONEY IS ONLY AVAILABLE FOR ORDERS FOR PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AGAIN FOR THIS MEDI CAL POPULATION. ABOUT THAT WE WILL START TAKING APPLICATIONS IN THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS SO WE HOPE TO HAVE THOSE AWARDS LATER THIS YEAR. AND SO THAT'S THE FIRST YEAR OF THE SB TO FUND THE WE'RE MISSING TO THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE VISION STARTING YOUR TO THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTED US. TO GIVE 70% OF THE MONEY FROM THE SB TO REVENUES TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND SO WITH THE PERMANENT LOCAL HOUSING PROGRAM -- WILL HAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. WE HAVE PUT OUT OF FRAME IS BY FORMULA AND I WILL SAY THAT WHEN YOU GET THE FORMULA USES THE COMMUNITY ALL THE BLOCK GRANT FORMULA. WHEN YOU START GETTING THE SOME OF THE SMALLER CITIES THE AMOUNTS THAT WERE GIVING OUT ARE QUITE SMALL I'D SAY OF THE THE THE SMALLEST GROUP OF CITY THE AVERAGE ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT THEY WOULD GET EACH? EVEN THE NEXT TROTTER CITIES OUT THE AVERAGE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND SO YOU KNOW SOMETHING YOU KNOW WE MAY MONITOR THINK ABOUT AS WAS IS -- IN MISTER THIS PROGRAM GOING FORWARD -- BUT NONE THE LESS -- WE'RE HAVE PUT OUT A DRAFT FRAMING PAPERWORK GETTING SOME IDEAS FROM FROM THE COMMUNITY ON SORT OF HOW WE WANT. TO ADMINISTER THAT PROGRAM WE WE PUT WE INTEND TO PUT OUT DRAFT GUIDELINES IN APRIL AND START. ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS IN AUGUST -- BUT YET SO WE ARE MOVING IN WITH THAT PROGRAM MOVING FORWARD. AND THEN I ALSO WE ALSO TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE KNOW PLACES LIKE HOME NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROGRAM THIS IS AGAIN A USES FUNDS IN A MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACTED TO HOUSE FOR PERSONS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS -- IT WAS THE SUBJECT OF FOR THE PROPOSITION TWO ON THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER THAT THE WITH THE VOTER SORT OF VALIDATED THIS APPROACH. WE HAVE ALREADY. NO EVEN EVEN BEFORE THE BALLOT MEASURE WAS APPROVED IN ANTICIPATION OF THAT WE PUT OUT A COMPENDIUM A NOTICE OF FUNDING AVAILABILITY FOR NON COMPETITIVE FUNDS. SOME OF THE FUNDS ARE GO BYE BYE FORMULA TO COUNTIES. AND AND THAT IS OPEN TO COUNTIES FOR YEAR TO COME IN AND AND REQUEST THOSE FUNDS. IN OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR AGAIN BEFORE THE BALLOT BEFORE THE ELECTION -- WE OPEN UP THE COMPETITION FOR THE COMPETITIVE SIDE WE HAD FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE -- AND I WILL KNOW THAT THERE ARE. A FOR COUNTIES IF THEY HAVE MORE THAN 5% THE STATE'S HOLD POPULATION THINKING CAN KIND O COMBINE THOSE COMPETITIVE NON COMPETITIVE OUT AND GET A BLOCK GRANT. WE ARE ABOUT TO WARD THOSE FUNDS TO THREE VERY LARGE COUNTIES -- WE EXPECT TO GET AN APPLICATION FROM SAN FRANCISCO ALSO IN THE NEAR FUTURE BUT SO SO THOSE FOR CANADA GOING TO KIND OF RUN THE PROGRAM ON THEIR OWN. THE FOR THE REST OF THE STATE -- WE JUST PUT OUT A NO FOR FOR OUR COMPETITIVE FUNDS -- WE HAD A NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR MEN SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION AVAILABLE SO WE ARE GOING THROUGH AND READING AND WRITING THOSE APPLICATIONS NOW -- WE WILL BE ABLE TO FIND MOST OF THE APPLICATIONS OBVIOUSLY BUT NOT ALL. AND THEN LASTLY -- YOU KNOW WE AVE WE HAVE A NUMBER OF OTHER PROGRAMS FROM THE SB THREE HOUSING BONDS THAT WE ARE MISSING WE WE INTEND TO PUT OUT SIX NOTICES THE FUNDING AVAILABLE. NOTICES THE FUNDING AVAILABILITY IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS -- THAT TO KIND OF KEEP THOSE PROGRAMS OING ON SORT OF A LITTLE BIT OF A STAGGERED SCHEDULE -- THE FIRST ONE WILL BE THE MULTI FAMILY HOUSING PROGRAM WHICH IS I I WOULD SAY OUR MAIN. KIND OF WORK COURSE RENTAL HOUSING -- AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOUSING PROGRAM AND THAT WILL GO OUT -- IN APRIL FOR ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. SO BOTTOM LINE IS WE ARE TRYING TO DILIGENTLY PUT THE MONEY OUT IN AN EXPEDITIOUS MANNER WE'RE TRYING TO BE THOUGHTFUL AND HOW WE SORT OF STRUCTURE THESE PROGRAMS -- LOOKING FOR PUBLIC COMMENT ON OUR GUIDELINES BEFORE WE SORT OF PUT THE PROGRAMS OUT -- BUT WE ARE TRYING TO MOVE FAST TO GET THAT MONEY AT THE DOOR BECAUSE WE ALL UNDERSTAND THE THE HOUSING NEEDS ARE DIRE AND EXTREME AT THIS MOMENT AND WE'RE TRYING TO GET THOSE PROJECTS THE RENT READY TO GO ON ON THE GROUND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. A GOOD AFTERNOON HOW MY NAME IS FRIENDS ASK MARTY. ON I'M THE NEW LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY. THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK HERE ON BEHALF OF COLLEGE OF FAYE AND OF OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR TIA BOWMAN PATTERSON. AS YOU ARE ALL AWARE CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS IS REACHING ALARMING LEVELS. AFFECTS BROAD SEGMENTS OF OUR SOCIETY HANDS ON DECK APPROACH WITH DIFFERENT AGENCIES WORKING IN CONCERT WITH ONE ANOTHER. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WE'RE SEEING MORE ENERGY BOLD IDEAS AND FOCUS ON SOLVING THE HOUSING CRISIS THAN ANY TIME IN RECENT MEMORY. AT AT AT AT COLLEGE OF A FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS WE HAVE BEEN BE TOOLING OUR AGENCY. I HAVE BECOME MORE EFFICIENT AT SERVING MORE LOW AND MODERATE INCOME CALIFORNIANS THAN EVER BEFORE. WE HAVE BUILT AN IMPRESSIVE PUBLIC PRIVATE ENGINE THAT STAND READY TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION TO HOUSING CRISIS. FOSTER MAY GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ABOUT OUR AGENCY OR REASON ACCOMPLISHMENTS ON THE STATUS OF A CURRENT WORK. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW COLLEGE OFFICIALS AS A STATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING LENDER I WAS CREATED IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE TO DEVELOP PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN STATE GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE CAPITAL INVESTORS COLLEGE OF A IS UNIQUE BECAUSE WE'RE AN INDEPENDENT SELF FUNDED AGENCY. WE FINANCIAL OPERATIONS FROM REVENUES GENERATED WHO ARE LENDING ACTIVITY AND WE INVEST ANY EARNINGS IN TWO MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE PROVIDE LOW COST DEBT FINANCING RAISED IN PRIVATE CAPITAL MARKETS WHICH SERVES TO COMPLEMENT OUR SISTER AGENCY A CD THAT PROVIDE FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT FUNDED SUBSIDIES. ON THE SINGLE FAMILY SIDE WE OFFER MORTGAGES TO A NETWORK OF LENDING PARTNERS WE PARA MORTGAGES WITH DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE AND CLOSING COST ASSISTANCE. FOR LOW TO MODERATE INCOME CALIFORNIANS MOST OF THEM FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS WE ALSO SUPPORT THE CREATION OF AFFORDABLE MULTI FAMILY HOUSING INCLUDING. MIXED INCOME HOUSING SPECIAL NEEDS HOUSING HOUSING FOR SENIORS AND HOUSING FOR VETERANS. THE SCOPE AND APPROACH THE CONTINUUM OF HOUSING NEEDS IS ADDRESSED IN COLLEGE OF ITS MISSION. THAT WHICH IS TO CREATE AND FINANCE PROGRESSIVE HOUSING SOLUTIONS SO MORE CALIFORNIANS HAVE A PLACE TO CALL HOME. TO GIVE YOU A BIT OF AN UPDATE ON WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON AT COLLEGE OF A WHOLE SHOW WITH YOU IF YOU. ARE RECENT ACHIEVEMENTS IN THREE KEY AREAS HOMEOWNERSHIP MULTI FAMILY UNDER OVERALL FINANCIAL POSITION. FIRST A FEW METRICS -- HOMEOWNERSHIP. LAST YEAR COLLEGE OF A CLOSED ON OVER TWO BILLION IN MORTGAGES FINEST THROUGH A PRIVATE CAPITAL MARKETS HISTORIC HIGH FOR THE AGENCY. THAT HAS ALLOWED US TO SERVE SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS ALLOW THEM TO BECOME HOMEOWNERS FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR WE ARE PROJECTED TO BREAK THAT RECORD AGAIN. AND FINANCE THREE BILLION IN MORTGAGES SERVING OVER TEN THOUSAND HOUSING. ANOTHER IMPRESSIVE METRIC IS THE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN MILLION WORTH OF DOWN PAYMENT AND CLOSING COSTS ASSISTANCE FOR FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS THAT WE HAVE DELIVERED IN THE LAST YEAR. AND THE PEOPLE WE SERVE AT COLLEGE OF A ARE AS DIVERSE AS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ITSELF WE ARE PROUD TO SAY THAT OVER TWO THIRDS OF THE CALIFORNIA'S WE HELP. BECOME HOMEOWNERS IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WERE TRADITIONALLY UNDERSERVED BLACK AND BROWN BE OUR WORST. THIS SECOND AREA WHERE I WANT TO SHARE SOME -- SOME REASON MILESTONES IS OUR MULTI THE FATE LAST YEAR. PROVIDED THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY A MILLION AND FINANCING TO HELP CREATE OR PRESERVE TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED UNITS OF MULTI FAMILY HOUSING. SINCE THE EIGHT INSTANCE INCEPTION WE HAVE CREATED. AND PRESERVED MORE THAN SIXTY THREE THOUSAND UNITS. OF MULTI FAMILY HOUSING AND PROVIDE A FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION IN FINANCING. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS WE HAVE CONTINUOUSLY INCREASED OUR UTILIZATION OF PRIVATE ACTIVITY BONDS PROVIDING THREES. THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO MILLION IN BOND FINANCING. THE USE OF PRIVATE ACTIVITY BONDS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY GENERATE THE 4% LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT WHICH IS A VITAL SOURCE TO BUILDING MOST AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN CALIFORNIA. SO THE THIRD AREA LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT IS OURFINANCIAL STRENGTH WHICH HAS BEEN IN KNOWLEDGE WHETHER TWO MAJOR CREDIT RATING AGENCIES MOODY'S AND FINANCIAL AND POURS -- THEY HAVE RAISED A CREDIT RATING SPEND TIMES IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND ME AND ARE MOODY'S RATING IS A ONE WITH POSITIVE OUTLOOK OR AS A B. RATING IS A PLUS WITH A POSITIVE OUTLOOK. BOTH RATING AGENCIES ATTRIBUTE ARE CREATING QUITE A RATING UPGRADES TO EXPERIENCE MANAGEMENT AND FIVE CONSECUTIVE YEARS OF STRENGTH IT EQUITY AND PROFITABILITY RATIO. OUR RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION THESE RATINGS GIVE US THE ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL AND HELP MORE FAMILIES. SOMEOF THE MOST EXCITING INITIATIVE WE ARE CURRENTLY ROLLING OUT ARE RELATED TO THE HOUSING PACKAGE PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN -- TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AS YOU HEARD A SHE IS IMPLEMENTING THE MAJORITY OF THIS PACKAGE BUT COLLEGE OF A HAS A HAS A ROLE AS WELL PROP ONE BUYS BY VOTERS LAST NOVEMBER ALLOCATE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. TO COLLEGE OF A FOR DOWN PAYMENT AND CLOSING COSTS ASSISTANCE FOR FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS WITH LOW TO MODERATE INCOMES. THIS WILL BE USED TO EXPAND OUR EXISTING DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE INFRASTRUCTURE. WE HAVE TO ME WITHA WITH THE ADDITIONAL HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION WE WILL WE BE ABLE TO PROVIDE DOWN PAYMENT OR CLOSING COST ASSISTANCE FOR AN ADDITIONAL. TWENTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS OVER THE NEXT -- WALL PROP ONE FUNDING IS ONE TIME AS BE. TO PROVIDES AN ONGOING PERMANENT SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND STARTING IN FLOW TO COLLEGE OF A FOR THE PURPOSE OF CREATING. MAKES THE INCOME MULTI FAMILY HOUSING. OVER THE PAST YEAR COLLEGE OF A HAS ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS AND USED THEIR INPUT TO DESIGN A NEW MAKES INCOME PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM IS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND IN CALIFORNIA AND WE WANT TO THANK THE LEGISLATURE AND SPECIALLY ITS SPONSORS AND A PRO TEM ATKINS FOR PARTNERING WITH US. AND MAKING THIS PROGRAM POSSIBLE. EARLIER THIS YEAR WE WERE EXCITED TO OPEN OUR APPLICATION FOR THE FIRST ROUND OF THE PROGRAM WHICH MAKES FORTY MILLION AVAILABLE AND IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE FINANCING TO SUPPORT THE PRODUCTION. OF UP TO ELEVEN HUNDRED NEW UNITS FOR CALIFORNIA. THE MIX INCOME IT PROGRAM IS PRODUCTION FOCUSED IT'S DESIGNED THIS GAP FINANCING FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. THAT PLAN ON USING BONDS AND TAX CREDITS BUT NEED ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE TO PENCIL OUT. THIS PROJECT WILL SERVE A BROAD RANGE OF INCOMES ANYWHERE BETWEEN 30% AND A 100% OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME. WE ARE ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS TO APRIL THIRTIETH AND WILL BE ANNOUNCING AWARDS IN THE SUMMER. AS YOU CAN SEE WOULD BUILD UP POWERFUL PUBLIC PRIVATE EGET AT COLLEGE OF IT HAS THE CAPACITY. TO HELP WITH THE HOW THE CRISIS WE STARTED READY TO COLLABORATE WITH PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERS INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS TO SOLVE ONE OF THE MOST PRESSING TIME HIS HEART. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE -- THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M TO ANYBODY FOOT THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR THE HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL. IN MY REMARKS THIS AFTERNOON WILL ADDRESS BRIEFLY THE ROLE AND SCOPE OF THE COUNCIL. SOME OF THE MAJOR ACTIVITIES AND DELIVERABLES WERE CURRENTLY WORKING ON AND THE STATUS OF THE HOMELESS EMERGENCY AID PROGRAM ARE HEAP AS WELL AS SOME LESSONS LEARNED FROM THAT PROGRAM TO DATE. TURNING FIRST TO THE ROLE AND SCOPE OF THE COUNCIL AS YOU KNOW THE COUNCIL WAS ESTABLISHED IN -- TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN BY A SENATE BILL. THIRTEEN EIGHTY CHAIRED A AUTHORED BY A ARE CHAIR -- SENATOR MITCHELL TO OVERSEE THE OF HOUSING FIRST GUIDELINES AND REGULATIONS AND AMONGOTHER THINGS TO IDENTIFY AND COORDINATE STATE RESOURCES AND SERVICES TO PREVENT AN ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. THE COUNCIL WAS INITIALLY HOUSED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. AND IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET -- IT WAS MOVED TO THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY. THE CHAIR OF THE COUNCIL -- WAS DESIGNATED -- TO BE THE SECRETARY OF THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY. AND THE BUDGET ALSO PROVIDED FUNDING TO HIRE FULL TIME STAFF OF WHICH ONE IS MYSELF. TO SUPPORT IMPLEMENTING HOUSE ALL OF THE COUNCIL MANDATES INCLUDING HE THE COUNCIL IS COMPRISED UP TO NINETEEN MEMBERS REPRESENTING STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS. WITH PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVES OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND COMMUNITY STAKE HOLDERS. THE COUNCIL MEETS QUARTERLY AND COUNCILMEMBERS PROVIDE INPUT AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE THE COUNCIL'S GOALS. THERE IS AN INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP THAT MEETS TWICE A MONTH TO SUPPORT THE WORK OF THE COUNCIL. PROVIDING INPUT AND SUPPORT TO COUNSEL STAFF IN ACHIEVING COUNCIL GOALS. CURRENTLY THE MAJOR FOCUS OF THE INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP IS IMPLEMENTING HOUSING FIRST. TURNING NEXT TO THE COUNCIL'S CURRENT WORK IN ADDITION TO IMPLEMENTING KEEP WHICH I WILL COVER IN MORE DETAIL SHORTLY. THE COUNSELORS IMPLEMENTING SEVERAL OTHER IMPORTANT INITIATIVES. AS I MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO WORK CONTINUES TO IMPLEMENT HOUSING FIRST ACROSS ALL STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS WITH HOUSING AND HOUSING RELATED SERVICES PROGRAMS. A CHECKLIST FOR DEPARTMENTS TO USE PROGRAMS AND IDENTIFYING ANY CHANGES NEEDED TO REGULATIONS AND GUIDELINES WAS DEVELOPED. SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS HAVE DONE THEIR ASSESSMENTS AND MADE PRESENTATIONS TO THE COUNCIL TO DATE OF THOSE ARE MY TWO SISTER AGENCIES SITTING. BY LEFT -- CAL HFA -- THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ALONG WITH THE TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE REMAINING DEPARTMENTS REPRESENTED ON THE COUNCIL -- TO COMPLETE THEIR HOUSING FIRST ASSESSMENTS AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT ALL THE INITIAL ASSESSMENTS AND CHANGES NEEDED TO GUIDELINES -- WILL BE COMPLETE BY JULY FIRST TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AS REQUIRED IN STATUTE. WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF DATA AS SENATORS SKINNER MENTIONED EARLIER AND SO WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A POTENTIAL STATE LEVEL HOMELESS DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM. THAT WOULD PROVIDE THE DATA NECESSARY TO MAKE INFORMED POLICY DECISIONS TO BETTER ALIGN OUR RESOURCES WITH THE NEEDS OF THE HOMELESS POPULATIONS IN OUR STATE. THE IMMEDIATE PRIORITY PHASE ONE IS ESTABLISHING A STATE HOMELESS DATA SYSTEM THAT GIVES THE STATE ACCESS TO DATA THAT IS CURRENTLY ALREADY BEING COLLECTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THROUGH HOMELESS MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS. THE SECOND PHASE WOULD BE TO BUILD A PLATFORM THAT CAN ALSO INTEGRATE. AND ANALYZE DATA COLLECTED FROM STATE AGENCY AND DEPARTMENT PROGRAMS AS WELL AS OTHER LOCAL SOURCES. IF FUNDING IS MADE OF A AVAILABLE FOR THIS WORK PROCUREMENT FOR PHASE ONE WHICH IS AGAIN GETTING ACCESS TO DATA ALREADY COLLECTED. COULD BEGIN IN THE FALL OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE'RE ALSO EMBARKING ON AN INITIATIVE TO DEVELOP A DATA DRIVEN EVIDENCE BASED HIGH LEVEL STRATEGIC PLAN FOR THE STATE. THIS WORK WILL FOCUS ON IDENTIFYING STATE STRATEGIES TO STOP THE GROWTH IN HOMELESSNESS SHELTER THE ON SHELTERED AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE OVERALL NUMBERS OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA. AS A FIRST STEP IN THIS WORK WE ISSUED AN INVITATION TO THE RESEARCH POLICY AND PROGRAM EXPERTS IN CALIFORNIA. TO PROVIDE US WITH BRIEF WHITE PAPERS ON THEIR EVIDENCE BASED RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SPECIFIC PRIORITY ACTIONS THE STATE SHOULD TAKE IN THE NEXT ONE TO THREE YEARS. AND FINALLY WERE WORKING WITH OUR STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERS TO COLLABORATE IN PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEER TO PEER LEARNING. FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND TO LOOK FOR OTHER WAYS TO COORDINATE STATE AND FEDERAL HOMELESSNESS ACTIVITIES AND ALIGN PROGRAM GOALS REQUIREMENTS AND TIMELINES WHEREVER POSSIBLE. TURNING NOW TO AN UPDATE ON KEEP. AS YOU KNOW THE HOMELESS EMERGENCY. AID PROGRAMMER HEAP AS WE CALL LISTEN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. IT'S A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME FLEXIBLE BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM DESIGNED TO PROVIDE. DIRECT ASSISTANCE TO CITIES COUNTIES AND CONTINUES OF CARE. TO ADDRESS THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS ARE THE ELEVEN LARGEST CITIES THOSE WITH A POPULATION OF THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND AS OF JULY AS OF JANUARY FIRST. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND THE FORTY THREE CONTINUUM'S OF CARE AND FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED USING A FORMULA THAT'S BASED LARGELY ON THE JURISDICTION SHARE OF THE STATE'S HOMELESS POPULATION. THE PROGRAM GUIDANCE WHICH MAPPED OUT APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS AN ALLOWABLE ACTIVITIES WAS ISSUED IN AUGUST. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE NOTICE OF FUNDING AVAILABILITY WAS ISSUED ON SEPTEMBER FIFTH AND THE FIRST TWO APPLICATIONS FROM THE CITY OF OAKLAND IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO WERE ALSO WERE SUBMITTED ON SEPTEMBER FIFTH. WE RECEIVED APPLICATIONS FROM ALL FORTY THREE CONTINUES OF CARE AND THE ELEVEN LARGE CITIES BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHICH WAS THE CUT OFF DATE FOR ROUND ONE OF FUNDING. AND THIS I REALLY GOOD NEWS BECAUSE IT MEANS A SECOND ROUND OF FUNDING IS NOT NEEDED. AND ONCE HE FUNDS OF ALL BEEN DISPERSED THE HEAP TEAM WILL TURN ITS ATTENTION TO PROVIDING SUPPORT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. TO THE COUNT THE CONTINUUM OF CARE IN CITIES AS THE IMPLEMENT THEIR HEAT FUNDED PROGRAMS. I BELIEVE THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN GIVEN A CHART THAT SUMMARIZES THANK YOU GOOD. SO I'LL JUST TOUCH ON A COUPLE OF KEY KEY POINTS. ONE WE CONSISTENTLY MET OUR INTERNAL GOAL OF AWARDING HEAP FUNDS WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS OF RECEIPT OF A COMPLETED APPLICATION. WE ALSO CONSISTENTLY MATTER IN COULD TORNAL GOAL OF DISBURSING KEEP FUNDS WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS OF RECEIPT OF AN EXECUTED STANDARD AGREEMENT. FOR A 100% OF THESE GRANTS WE HAVE MET OUR COMMITMENT TO DISPERSE HEAP FUNDS IN THIS IS DISPERSED IN A SINGLE PAYMENT. ONCE THE CONTRACT HAS BEEN EXECUTED. WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF THE DAY SHIN WAS WAS DEEMED COMPLETE. AS OF FEBRUARY NINETEENTH MORE THAN 80% OF ALL HE FUNDS HAVE BEEN DISPERSED. ALL OF THE ELEVEN LARGE CITIES HAVE RECEIVED THEIR DISBURSEMENTS SO THOSE FUNDS ARE OUT IN THESE COMMUNITIES ALREADY HOPEFULLY DOING SOME GOOD -- SO FAR THE CITIES AND CONTINUES OF CARE THAT HAVE BEEN AWARDED HE FUNDS HAVE COMMITTED TO ALLOCATING THESE FUNDS IN THE FOLLOWING MAJOR CATEGORIES. THE TOP CATEGORY IS SERVICES WITH ABOUT 38% OF THE TOTAL FUNDS. NEXT IS CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS ABOUT THIRTY FOUR OF TOTAL HE FUNDS. RENTAL ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN -- PROPOSED 413% OF TOTAL FUNDS AWARDED. HOMELESS YOUTH HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED ALMOST 7% OF TOTAL HE FUNDING AND WE WERE PLEASED TO SEE THAT THIS IS HIGHER. THAN THE 5% SET ASIDE REQUIRED FOR USING HE FUNDS. AND LIKEWISE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS -- HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED LESS THAN 5% CAP THAT WAS ALSO ALLOWED IN HEAT. WITH ABOUT 4% OF TOTAL FUNDS GOING FOR ADMINISTRATION. AND THEN OTHER WHICH INCLUDES THINGS LIKE -- BATHROOMS AND HAND WASHING STATIONS OF REPRESENT ABOUT 3% OF TOTAL FUNDS. TURNING FINALLY TO LESSONS LEARNED FROM HEAT. IT'S CLEARLY EARLY DAYS WITH THE PROGRAM WERE JUST IN THE IN THE PROCESS OF FINALIZING AND DISBURSING THE REMAINING FUNDS. ON BUT I THINK THERE ARE STILL A FEW LESSONS LEARNED THAT I HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO OUR SUCCESS IN ESTABLISHING THE PROGRAM AND DISBURSING THE FUNDS SO QUICKLY. FIRST THE AUTHORIZING STATUTE WAS CLEARER BUT NOT TO DIRECTIVE IN THE MAJOR PROGRAM STRUCTURE ELIGIBLE APPLIQUE APPLICANTS AND USES AN ALLOCATION FORMULA PROVISIONS. IT ALLOWED US TO MOVE AHEAD% QUICKLY AT THE SAME TIME GAVE US ENOUGH DISCRETION TO MAKE THE SPECIFIC DECISIONS BUT INEVITABLY ARISE WHEN DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING A NEW PROGRAM. SECOND WE DELIBERATELY SET OUT TO MAKE THE PROGRAM AS SIMPLE TRANSPARENT AND STREAMLINED AS POSSIBLE. WITH AN EYE ON HOW WE COULD MAKE THINGS AS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR OUR APPLICANTS AND NOW OUR GRANTEES. WE TOOK FLEXIBILITY TO HEART THE WORKING HARDTO ENSURE SUFFICIENT GUIDANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THIS IS WHY RECEIVED OUR FIRST APPLICATIONS FROM SAN DIEGO IN OAKLAND ON THE SAME DAY THAT WE ISSUED THE NOTICE OF FUNDING AVAILABILITY. THIRD WE TOOK PARTNERSHIP SERIOUSLY OF THE THREE POSITIONS AUTHORIZED TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT KEEP ONE IS A LOCAL GOVERNMENT LIAISON WHOSE PRIMARY ROLE IS TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE CITIES COUNTIES AND CONTINUES OF CARE. KEEP STUFF SPENT A LOT OF TIME LAST FALL AND ACTUALLY TWO OF MY STAFF FOR DOING PRESENTATIONS AS I SPEAK -- DOING PRESENTATIONS AND WEBINARS ACROSS THE STATE HOLDING WEEKLY OFFICE HOURS AND ANSWERING A LARGE NUMBER OF EMAILS AND CALLS. THROUGHOUT THE APPLICATION PERIOD THE TEAM ALSO PROVIDED ONE ON ONE SUPPORT AND DIRECTING GAUGE MEANT WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WHICH WAS POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT WAS NOT A COMPETITIVE PROGRAM. THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LIAISON CONTINUES TO HOLD WEEKLY OFFICE HOURS IN WHICH ALL CITIES COUNTIES AND CONTINUES OF CARE. CAN CALL IN TO DISCUSS ANY TOPIC WITH BOTH THE STAFF AND WITH THEIR PEERS. AND FINALLY WE KNOW THE WORK IS NOT OVER. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE REAL SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM MEANING THE FUNDS ARE USED EFFECTIVELY% AND EFFICIENTLY AND MAKE REAL PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. WE MISCHIEF QUICKLY INTO PROVIDING SUPPORT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AS WELL AS ESTABLISHING GOOD REPORTING PROCESS SEES AND MONITORING PERFORMANCE OVER THE LIFE OF THE GRANT. CONSISTENT WITH OUR OVERALL APPROACH WE WILL ENGAGE IN THESE ACTIVITIES WITH THE CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO PARTNERSHIP FOCUSING ON HOW WE CAN ASSIST GRANTEES IN ACCOMPLISHING THEIR GOALS. AND MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE PANEL -- FOR BEING HERE AND YOUR TESTIMONY. QUESTION CENTER MORE LAW.
