00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:06.600 region:rollup2
this meeting will come to order

00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:08.168 region:rollup2
my name is Jim Grayson assembly

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.270 region:rollup2
member for assembly district

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:12.306 region:rollup2
fourteen. And I chair the select

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.408 region:rollup2
committee. And I want to first.

00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:16.176 region:rollup2
Thank everyone for being here

00:01:14.408 --> 00:01:18.178 region:rollup2
good morning to you and welcome

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:19.980 region:rollup2
to the very first hearing of the

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:21.982 region:rollup2
assembly select committee on

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.516 region:rollup2
streamlining services for

00:01:21.982 --> 00:01:24.251 region:rollup2
victims of interpersonal

00:01:22.516 --> 00:01:26.153 region:rollup2
violence. The purpose of the

00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:27.921 region:rollup2
select committee is to examine

00:01:26.153 --> 00:01:30.123 region:rollup2
the colonel's.

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:31.992 region:rollup2
The victims of interpersonal

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:32.593 region:rollup2
violence face when seeking help

00:01:31.992 --> 00:01:33.927 region:rollup2
from service providers and law

00:01:32.593 --> 00:01:36.163 region:rollup2
enforcement.

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:37.998 region:rollup2
By reviewing how victims of

00:01:36.163 --> 00:01:40.067 region:rollup2
interpersonal violence are being

00:01:37.998 --> 00:01:41.902 region:rollup2
served. I believe that the

00:01:40.067 --> 00:01:43.904 region:rollup2
legislature can gain important

00:01:41.902 --> 00:01:44.538 region:rollup2
insight into the ways in which

00:01:43.904 --> 00:01:46.406 region:rollup2
the state's current laws are

00:01:44.538 --> 00:01:49.943 region:rollup2
being implemented. And ascertain

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:50.444 region:rollup2
whether changes are necessary to

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:52.212 region:rollup2
ensure that victims are

00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:55.949 region:rollup2
receiving the best possible

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:56.516 region:rollup2
service and support. The focus

00:01:55.949 --> 00:02:00.020 region:rollup2
of today's hearing is human

00:01:56.516 --> 00:02:02.055 region:rollup2
trafficking and the crisis that

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.991 region:rollup2
California is facing. As you all

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:04.558 region:rollup2
know human trafficking is

00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:06.226 region:rollup2
reported to be the world's

00:02:04.558 --> 00:02:08.295 region:rollup2
fastest growing criminal

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:10.364 region:rollup2
enterprise. And in two thousand

00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:12.366 region:rollup2
sixteen. At least it was labeled

00:02:10.364 --> 00:02:14.301 region:rollup2
that two thousand sixteen and

00:02:12.366 --> 00:02:16.236 region:rollup2
California was actually listed

00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:18.271 region:rollup2
as the state with the highest

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:20.207 region:rollup2
number of reported human

00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:22.109 region:rollup2
trafficking victims. In order to

00:02:20.207 --> 00:02:24.411 region:rollup2
help the legislature remain

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:26.279 region:rollup2
vigilant in the effort to combat

00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:28.148 region:rollup2
human trafficking in California.

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:30.317 region:rollup2
The select committee hearing

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:32.419 region:rollup2
will examine the nature of art

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:35.989 region:rollup2
of our state's human trafficking

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:36.556 region:rollup2
crisis and assess the services

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.025 region:rollup2
available human trafficking

00:02:36.556 --> 00:02:40.193 region:rollup2
victims.

00:02:38.025 --> 00:02:41.995 region:rollup2
Our goal is to shine a spotlight

00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:44.064 region:rollup2
on the persistent and growing

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:45.999 region:rollup2
problem of human trafficking in

00:02:44.064 --> 00:02:48.068 region:rollup2
California. And hear from those

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.602 region:rollup2
who work to serve victims of

00:02:48.068 --> 00:02:52.039 region:rollup2
human trafficking by by

00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:52.639 region:rollup2
prosecuting perpetrators and or

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:54.408 region:rollup2
by providing services to the

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:56.376 region:rollup2
victims. I believe that it's

00:02:54.408 --> 00:02:58.445 region:rollup2
important to understand that

00:02:56.376 --> 00:03:00.380 region:rollup2
where we are to that where we

00:02:58.445 --> 00:03:02.349 region:rollup2
are today and what exist as far

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.117 region:rollup2
as issues than the current

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.086 region:rollup2
system in order to improve. And

00:03:04.117 --> 00:03:06.720 region:rollup2
to move the needle forward to

00:03:06.086 --> 00:03:08.055 region:rollup2
eliminate human trafficking in

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.057 region:rollup2
our state.

00:03:08.055 --> 00:03:12.092 region:rollup2
Today I look forward.

00:03:10.057 --> 00:03:14.194 region:rollup2
With our special guest and

00:03:12.092 --> 00:03:16.096 region:rollup2

and being further educated on

00:03:16.096 --> 00:03:18.432 region:rollup2
the issue of human trafficking.

00:03:16.763 --> 00:03:20.467 region:rollup2

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:10.570 region:rollup2
District attorney or knowledge

00:06:10.303 --> 00:06:12.372 region:rollup2
to begin.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.006 region:rollup2
Today's panel.

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:14.307 region:rollup2
Thank you simply member very

00:06:13.006 --> 00:06:14.941 region:rollup2
much for a couple of things one

00:06:14.307 --> 00:06:16.476 region:rollup2
for. Being a champion in this

00:06:14.941 --> 00:06:17.077 region:rollup2
area and I know that.

00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:20.480 region:rollup2
That some to this issue around

00:06:17.077 --> 00:06:22.415 region:rollup2
human

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.251 region:rollup2
trafficking one of my greatest

00:06:22.415 --> 00:06:26.219 region:rollup2
concern is that.

00:06:24.251 --> 00:06:26.786 region:rollup2
We have done a lot to educate

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:28.255 region:rollup2
people about the term human

00:06:26.786 --> 00:06:30.423 region:rollup2
trafficking.

00:06:28.255 --> 00:06:32.325 region:rollup2
But we cannot become complacent

00:06:30.423 --> 00:06:34.227 region:rollup2
that somehow because we all know

00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:36.296 region:rollup2
the language that we have solved

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:38.331 region:rollup2
the problem. Because we have not

00:06:36.296 --> 00:06:38.999 region:rollup2
and so its hearings like this

00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:40.767 region:rollup2
and attention from leaders like

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:42.602 region:rollup2
you that are going to help us to

00:06:40.767 --> 00:06:44.638 region:rollup2
eventually get to a place where

00:06:42.602 --> 00:06:46.306 region:rollup2
we can say. We have ended human

00:06:44.638 --> 00:06:48.675 region:rollup2
trafficking in California.

00:06:46.306 --> 00:06:49.276 region:rollup2
And I have hope and I have faith

00:06:48.675 --> 00:06:50.310 region:rollup2
that we will all be able to do

00:06:49.276 --> 00:06:52.545 region:rollup2
that.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:54.481 region:rollup2
I'm gonna give an overview of

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:56.583 region:rollup2
some of the data that we have.

00:06:54.481 --> 00:06:58.618 region:rollup2
And and a little bit of a

00:06:56.583 --> 00:07:00.720 region:rollup2
background. Of a few years back

00:06:58.618 --> 00:07:02.455 region:rollup2
well first of all my first human

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.457 region:rollup2
trafficking prosecution case was

00:07:02.455 --> 00:07:06.693 region:rollup2
in nineteen ninety six. And it

00:07:04.457 --> 00:07:08.395 region:rollup2
involved a twelve year old girl

00:07:06.693 --> 00:07:10.297 region:rollup2
who's being trafficked by a

00:07:08.395 --> 00:07:10.864 region:rollup2
thirty nine year old man. Who is

00:07:10.297 --> 00:07:11.097 region:rollup2
selling her multiple times a

00:07:10.864 --> 00:07:12.666 region:rollup2
night?

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:14.734 region:rollup2
And when she was finally

00:07:12.666 --> 00:07:16.770 region:rollup2
separated or rescued away from.

00:07:14.734 --> 00:07:18.672 region:rollup2
The from the purchaser the man

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.707 region:rollup2
that bought her he was a fifty

00:07:18.672 --> 00:07:22.776 region:rollup2
year old man. And the police

00:07:20.707 --> 00:07:24.344 region:rollup2
found her in a motel room with

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:28.448 region:rollup2
them they were both prosecuted

00:07:24.344 --> 00:07:29.015 region:rollup2
by me. For rape. Of her and both

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:30.383 region:rollup2
were sent to prison for many

00:07:29.015 --> 00:07:30.884 region:rollup2
years.

00:07:30.383 --> 00:07:34.321 region:rollup2
And that was really the

00:07:30.884 --> 00:07:36.623 region:rollup2
beginning of my education and my

00:07:34.321 --> 00:07:38.425 region:rollup2
advocacy. On first learning as

00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:39.092 region:rollup2
much as I can about human

00:07:38.425 --> 00:07:40.360 region:rollup2
trafficking. And this insidious

00:07:39.092 --> 00:07:42.796 region:rollup2
crime.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.731 region:rollup2
That treats people like their

00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:46.433 region:rollup2
chattel like they're human ATM

00:07:44.731 --> 00:07:48.568 region:rollup2
machines and then secondly is to

00:07:46.433 --> 00:07:50.437 region:rollup2
find the solutions to end human

00:07:48.568 --> 00:07:51.071 region:rollup2
trafficking. And to serve those

00:07:50.437 --> 00:07:52.405 region:rollup2
that have been victimized by

00:07:51.071 --> 00:07:54.841 region:rollup2
this crime.

00:07:52.405 --> 00:07:56.609 region:rollup2
But part of my effort has been

00:07:54.841 --> 00:07:58.678 region:rollup2
also creation of the heat

00:07:56.609 --> 00:08:00.680 region:rollup2
institute that he is human

00:07:58.678 --> 00:08:01.214 region:rollup2
exploitation trafficking. And

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.284 region:rollup2
the institute. Isn't is a

00:08:01.214 --> 00:08:06.353 region:rollup2
funded.

00:08:04.284 --> 00:08:08.455 region:rollup2
Research institute focusing

00:08:06.353 --> 00:08:08.688 region:rollup2
solely on California at this

00:08:08.455 --> 00:08:10.523 region:rollup2
point.

00:08:08.688 --> 00:08:11.191 region:rollup2
We've been hearings all over

00:08:10.523 --> 00:08:12.759 region:rollup2
the state of California so we've

00:08:11.191 --> 00:08:14.694 region:rollup2
gathered a lot of data about how

00:08:12.759 --> 00:08:16.730 region:rollup2
our communities across

00:08:14.694 --> 00:08:18.531 region:rollup2
California. Are responding to

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:20.533 region:rollup2
and managing their work to

00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:22.569 region:rollup2
combat human trafficking so some

00:08:20.533 --> 00:08:24.471 region:rollup2
of the information I will share

00:08:22.569 --> 00:08:26.439 region:rollup2
with you comes from those those

00:08:24.471 --> 00:08:26.639 region:rollup2
hearings that we did.

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:28.441 region:rollup2
But.

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:30.577 region:rollup2
In.

00:08:28.441 --> 00:08:32.512 region:rollup2
Players and get it players

00:08:30.577 --> 00:08:34.447 region:rollup2
project is one of the major

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:36.449 region:rollup2
players in the country.

00:08:34.447 --> 00:08:38.418 region:rollup2
And that since two thousand and

00:08:36.449 --> 00:08:38.952 region:rollup2
seven players project which

00:08:38.418 --> 00:08:40.754 region:rollup2
managed as it manages the

00:08:38.952 --> 00:08:42.756 region:rollup2
national hotline. There been

00:08:40.754 --> 00:08:46.426 region:rollup2
over almost twenty two thousand

00:08:42.756 --> 00:08:47.060 region:rollup2
calls from California alone

00:08:46.426 --> 00:08:52.465 region:rollup2
reporting of incidents of human

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:53.033 region:rollup2
trafficking. Of those US.

00:08:52.465 --> 00:08:54.801 region:rollup2
As sixty one hundred almost

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:58.505 region:rollup2
sixty two hundred actually

00:08:54.801 --> 00:09:00.473 region:rollup2
resulted in cases in California.

00:08:58.505 --> 00:09:02.575 region:rollup2
And all its spot sixty three

00:09:00.473 --> 00:09:03.109 region:rollup2
hundred victims have been

00:09:02.575 --> 00:09:04.911 region:rollup2
identified to Clarice now

00:09:03.109 --> 00:09:06.746 region:rollup2
players is very quick to tell us

00:09:04.911 --> 00:09:08.948 region:rollup2
that their hotline. So what they

00:09:06.746 --> 00:09:10.617 region:rollup2
do is if somebody calls in a

00:09:08.948 --> 00:09:12.552 region:rollup2
report that they direct it right

00:09:10.617 --> 00:09:13.186 region:rollup2
back to the community I know

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:14.854 region:rollup2
that the the justice center here

00:09:13.186 --> 00:09:16.856 region:rollup2
in Contra Costa. Is very

00:09:14.854 --> 00:09:18.758 region:rollup2
involved in a zero tolerance in

00:09:16.856 --> 00:09:20.660 region:rollup2
the various counties so they

00:09:18.758 --> 00:09:21.161 region:rollup2
have. Identified those areas

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.495 region:rollup2
where those calls can be

00:09:21.161 --> 00:09:24.864 region:rollup2
returned.

00:09:22.495 --> 00:09:26.666 region:rollup2
But into from two thousand and

00:09:24.864 --> 00:09:28.568 region:rollup2
sixteen to seventeen there were

00:09:26.666 --> 00:09:30.737 region:rollup2
over four thousand calls from

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:32.539 region:rollup2
California alone to the national

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:33.106 region:rollup2
hotline.

00:09:32.539 --> 00:09:34.707 region:rollup2
Thirteen hundred thirty one

00:09:33.106 --> 00:09:36.709 region:rollup2
cases were reported in

00:09:34.707 --> 00:09:38.545 region:rollup2
California. And there were.

00:09:36.709 --> 00:09:40.747 region:rollup2
.

00:09:38.545 --> 00:09:42.549 region:rollup2
About a third of nine thousand

00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:44.484 region:rollup2
or three thousand.

00:09:42.549 --> 00:09:45.151 region:rollup2
Cases that moved forward or that

00:09:44.484 --> 00:09:46.653 region:rollup2
were investigated were here in

00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:48.755 region:rollup2
California two hundred and

00:09:46.653 --> 00:09:52.459 region:rollup2
Oakland alone. And that's my

00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:53.126 region:rollup2
community.

00:09:52.459 --> 00:09:54.894 region:rollup2
Some statistics about buyers and

00:09:53.126 --> 00:09:56.529 region:rollup2
I'm going to give a little bit

00:09:54.894 --> 00:09:57.197 region:rollup2
of emphasis and when we talk

00:09:56.529 --> 00:10:00.567 region:rollup2
about where we should be giving

00:09:57.197 --> 00:10:02.469 region:rollup2
focus. It's on Byers because

00:10:00.567 --> 00:10:03.069 region:rollup2
right now a person.

00:10:02.469 --> 00:10:04.504 region:rollup2
Well we've changed a lot over

00:10:03.069 --> 00:10:06.506 region:rollup2
the last couple of years to

00:10:04.504 --> 00:10:08.475 region:rollup2
separate fires.

00:10:06.506 --> 00:10:10.510 region:rollup2
From buyers of adult sex workers

00:10:08.475 --> 00:10:12.479 region:rollup2
from buyers of children for sex.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:13.112 region:rollup2
And I think this is an important

00:10:12.479 --> 00:10:14.914 region:rollup2
piece of legislation that was

00:10:13.112 --> 00:10:16.816 region:rollup2
passed because it allows us to

00:10:14.914 --> 00:10:18.785 region:rollup2
really. Gather the data that we

00:10:16.816 --> 00:10:22.455 region:rollup2
need to focus on who's

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:23.056 region:rollup2
purchasing children as in those

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:26.493 region:rollup2
that are on the spectrum for

00:10:23.056 --> 00:10:27.193 region:rollup2
child assault for sex offenders.

00:10:26.493 --> 00:10:28.962 region:rollup2
Are posed just engaging in adult

00:10:27.193 --> 00:10:30.597 region:rollup2
sex worker which is a different

00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:32.999 region:rollup2
dynamic.

00:10:30.597 --> 00:10:34.634 region:rollup2
But we have given no attention

00:10:32.999 --> 00:10:35.135 region:rollup2
and we have not increased the

00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:36.603 region:rollup2
punishment of buyers of

00:10:35.135 --> 00:10:38.605 region:rollup2
children.

00:10:36.603 --> 00:10:40.540 region:rollup2
That's an effort I will once

00:10:38.605 --> 00:10:41.174 region:rollup2
again introduce legislative a

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:44.644 region:rollup2
sponsor legislation so be our

00:10:41.174 --> 00:10:45.245 region:rollup2
fourth year. Of trying to change

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:46.679 region:rollup2
the punishment for buyers who

00:10:45.245 --> 00:10:48.915 region:rollup2
are fine children.

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:50.650 region:rollup2
In any event fourteen percent of

00:10:48.915 --> 00:10:52.685 region:rollup2
the men in the United States

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.319 region:rollup2
report paying for sex fourteen

00:10:52.685 --> 00:10:54.988 region:rollup2
percent that's fifteen million

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:56.556 region:rollup2
men. Who reported and admitted

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:58.758 region:rollup2
that they have bought?

00:10:56.556 --> 00:11:00.827 region:rollup2
I paid for sex seventy five

00:10:58.758 --> 00:11:02.629 region:rollup2
percent of the church children

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:04.531 region:rollup2
who are sexually exploited. Say

00:11:02.629 --> 00:11:06.833 region:rollup2
they have been inadvertently

00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:08.568 region:rollup2
sold. Online or they have been

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:10.770 region:rollup2
at advertised and sold online.

00:11:08.568 --> 00:11:14.574 region:rollup2
And according to the New York

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:15.241 region:rollup2
University study thirty six of a

00:11:14.574 --> 00:11:18.611 region:rollup2
percent of all internet content

00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:19.279 region:rollup2
now is*.

00:11:18.611 --> 00:11:22.582 region:rollup2
One in four internet searches

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:24.684 region:rollup2
for* and at any given time

00:11:22.582 --> 00:11:26.586 region:rollup2
one point seven million. Users

00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:28.888 region:rollup2
are streaming*.

00:11:26.586 --> 00:11:32.559 region:rollup2
Our research shows that there's

00:11:28.888 --> 00:11:33.092 region:rollup2
a direct link between*. And

00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:34.928 region:rollup2
on the spectrum of human

00:11:33.092 --> 00:11:38.598 region:rollup2
trafficking is a purchaser or as

00:11:34.928 --> 00:11:39.265 region:rollup2
an exploiter.

00:11:38.598 --> 00:11:42.869 region:rollup2
So we can't miss ought we can't

00:11:39.265 --> 00:11:44.604 region:rollup2
ignore the impact of* on

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:46.739 region:rollup2
this issue.

00:11:44.604 --> 00:11:48.975 region:rollup2
Locally I in my county one of

00:11:46.739 --> 00:11:50.777 region:rollup2
our youth guidance centers are

00:11:48.975 --> 00:11:52.645 region:rollup2
counting centers served a

00:11:50.777 --> 00:11:54.781 region:rollup2
hundred twenty three you.

00:11:52.645 --> 00:11:56.849 region:rollup2
Two thousand sixteen Missy and

00:11:54.781 --> 00:11:58.851 region:rollup2
you'll hear from Dr Haitian maze

00:11:56.849 --> 00:12:00.787 region:rollup2
later admits he served two

00:11:58.851 --> 00:12:01.254 region:rollup2
hundred thirty four youth that

00:12:00.787 --> 00:12:03.022 region:rollup2
are Oakland base you.

00:12:01.254 --> 00:12:04.757 region:rollup2
Who are all victims of child

00:12:03.022 --> 00:12:06.693 region:rollup2
sexual exploitation? And the

00:12:04.757 --> 00:12:07.226 region:rollup2
Oakland police department at

00:12:06.693 --> 00:12:08.661 region:rollup2
four hundred and five open

00:12:07.226 --> 00:12:12.632 region:rollup2
cases.

00:12:08.661 --> 00:12:14.634 region:rollup2
My office is prosecuted over

00:12:12.632 --> 00:12:16.669 region:rollup2
five hundred and fifty. Human

00:12:14.634 --> 00:12:18.871 region:rollup2
traffickers. Involving children.

00:12:16.669 --> 00:12:20.673 region:rollup2
And we have an eighty two

00:12:18.871 --> 00:12:22.675 region:rollup2
percent conviction rate so when

00:12:20.673 --> 00:12:23.343 region:rollup2
I my message to my colleagues

00:12:22.675 --> 00:12:26.679 region:rollup2
across the state is if you think

00:12:23.343 --> 00:12:27.313 region:rollup2
people will not convict. Human

00:12:26.679 --> 00:12:28.815 region:rollup2
trafficking because the victim

00:12:27.313 --> 00:12:30.883 region:rollup2
oftentimes has Vona has

00:12:28.815 --> 00:12:32.719 region:rollup2
vulnerabilities are the cases

00:12:30.883 --> 00:12:34.854 region:rollup2
that vulnerabilities look at

00:12:32.719 --> 00:12:36.723 region:rollup2
Alameda county eighty two

00:12:34.854 --> 00:12:38.658 region:rollup2
percent conviction. Of those and

00:12:36.723 --> 00:12:40.693 region:rollup2
that's been is cut a constant

00:12:38.658 --> 00:12:42.895 region:rollup2
for the last several years.

00:12:40.693 --> 00:12:45.031 region:rollup2
Fires in the bay area had

00:12:42.895 --> 00:12:46.933 region:rollup2
incomes sixty one percent at

00:12:45.031 --> 00:12:48.701 region:rollup2
incomes over sixty thousand

00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:50.803 region:rollup2
dollars.

00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:52.905 region:rollup2
The tech industry we have now

00:12:50.803 --> 00:12:54.741 region:rollup2
discovered has a higher incident

00:12:52.905 --> 00:12:55.308 region:rollup2
of purchasing so we just need to

00:12:54.741 --> 00:12:56.743 region:rollup2
give. Some real attention to

00:12:55.308 --> 00:12:59.045 region:rollup2
that.

00:12:56.743 --> 00:13:00.913 region:rollup2
We have a safety net program

00:12:59.045 --> 00:13:02.649 region:rollup2
which we've had since January of

00:13:00.913 --> 00:13:04.984 region:rollup2
two thousand and eleven.

00:13:02.649 --> 00:13:06.919 region:rollup2
A working group confidential. A

00:13:04.984 --> 00:13:08.888 region:rollup2
protected by confidentiality

00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:10.790 region:rollup2
working group meets every week

00:13:08.888 --> 00:13:11.391 region:rollup2
and we have met every week since

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.725 region:rollup2
January first of two thousand

00:13:11.391 --> 00:13:14.994 region:rollup2
eleven.

00:13:12.725 --> 00:13:16.963 region:rollup2
And we have now almost eight

00:13:14.994 --> 00:13:19.098 region:rollup2
hundred used in the database.

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:20.833 region:rollup2
And we use the database in order

00:13:19.098 --> 00:13:22.969 region:rollup2
to educate us about. Common

00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:23.603 region:rollup2
denominators a bike dynamics

00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:24.771 region:rollup2
about areas where we should get

00:13:23.603 --> 00:13:26.939 region:rollup2
focused.

00:13:24.771 --> 00:13:28.675 region:rollup2
We've seen only about one

00:13:26.939 --> 00:13:29.308 region:rollup2
percent male but we know that

00:13:28.675 --> 00:13:30.710 region:rollup2
males are being exploited at a

00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:34.881 region:rollup2
high rate.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:35.315 region:rollup2
We also are seeing. More youth

00:13:34.881 --> 00:13:36.816 region:rollup2
that are. That are.

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:38.785 region:rollup2
.

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:41.020 region:rollup2
Trans gender.

00:13:38.785 --> 00:13:42.922 region:rollup2
There's no question that for

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.489 region:rollup2
children particularly that the

00:13:42.922 --> 00:13:44.791 region:rollup2
incidence of child sexual

00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:46.926 region:rollup2
exploitation.

00:13:44.791 --> 00:13:48.795 region:rollup2
Children of color are

00:13:46.926 --> 00:13:51.064 region:rollup2
disproportionately represented.

00:13:48.795 --> 00:13:53.166 region:rollup2
And in my county in the stats we

00:13:51.064 --> 00:13:55.001 region:rollup2
have and I would just say that

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:56.936 region:rollup2
are the the people that we work

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:57.403 region:rollup2
with the young people. Are that

00:13:56.936 --> 00:13:59.372 region:rollup2
we have information.

00:13:57.403 --> 00:14:01.274 region:rollup2
That only about sixty three or

00:13:59.372 --> 00:14:03.242 region:rollup2
percent are from Alameda county.

00:14:01.274 --> 00:14:05.011 region:rollup2
We have children that are

00:14:03.242 --> 00:14:06.879 region:rollup2
identified from other states and

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:07.413 region:rollup2
certainly from other counties in

00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:08.848 region:rollup2
the bay area and for that

00:14:07.413 --> 00:14:10.850 region:rollup2
reason.

00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:12.819 region:rollup2
One of the efforts is to have

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:15.054 region:rollup2
regional responses as well.

00:14:12.819 --> 00:14:16.989 region:rollup2
And we're out this particular

00:14:15.054 --> 00:14:18.925 region:rollup2
bay area is very good at working

00:14:16.989 --> 00:14:20.693 region:rollup2
between Santa Clara county

00:14:18.925 --> 00:14:23.029 region:rollup2
contrast to San Francisco

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:24.997 region:rollup2
Alameda Solano now down into San

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:26.733 region:rollup2
Joaquin to really. Grow that

00:14:24.997 --> 00:14:28.901 region:rollup2
regional response.

00:14:26.733 --> 00:14:30.970 region:rollup2
But in my county sixty three

00:14:28.901 --> 00:14:32.972 region:rollup2
percent of the children that

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:35.074 region:rollup2
primarily girls. Are African

00:14:32.972 --> 00:14:37.110 region:rollup2
American about fifty percent

00:14:35.074 --> 00:14:37.543 region:rollup2
Latina. And thirty five percent

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:40.780 region:rollup2
said that they had.

00:14:37.543 --> 00:14:41.414 region:rollup2
.

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:43.116 region:rollup2
Sorry seventy five percent had

00:14:41.414 --> 00:14:44.751 region:rollup2
identified their own prior

00:14:43.116 --> 00:14:47.086 region:rollup2
victimization.

00:14:44.751 --> 00:14:48.855 region:rollup2
Hi incident of children who have

00:14:47.086 --> 00:14:50.723 region:rollup2
run away.

00:14:48.855 --> 00:14:51.324 region:rollup2
So some of the areas that we've

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:53.092 region:rollup2
identified that are of great

00:14:51.324 --> 00:14:53.426 region:rollup2
need and we've given great

00:14:53.092 --> 00:14:54.794 region:rollup2
attention to.

00:14:53.426 --> 00:14:58.965 region:rollup2
Are.

00:14:54.794 --> 00:14:59.432 region:rollup2
Housing. Of course housings an

00:14:58.965 --> 00:15:01.300 region:rollup2
issue for everybody.

00:14:59.432 --> 00:15:03.202 region:rollup2
But in this particular

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:06.906 region:rollup2
situation there is a lack of

00:15:03.202 --> 00:15:08.975 region:rollup2
really of lack of housing for

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:10.977 region:rollup2
safe housing for children. Or

00:15:08.975 --> 00:15:11.511 region:rollup2
for young adults who have been

00:15:10.977 --> 00:15:13.212 region:rollup2
separated away from the

00:15:11.511 --> 00:15:15.281 region:rollup2
exploiter who are. Who are

00:15:13.212 --> 00:15:16.849 region:rollup2
getting out of the life for I've

00:15:15.281 --> 00:15:19.051 region:rollup2
gotten out of the life?

00:15:16.849 --> 00:15:21.154 region:rollup2
We are encouraging our

00:15:19.051 --> 00:15:23.122 region:rollup2
communities to think out of the

00:15:21.154 --> 00:15:25.158 region:rollup2
box the rules around foster care

00:15:23.122 --> 00:15:27.093 region:rollup2
have changed regarding child

00:15:25.158 --> 00:15:29.061 region:rollup2
sexual assault excuse me the.

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:31.230 region:rollup2
Sexually exploited minors it's a

00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:32.932 region:rollup2
different licensing structure

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:34.801 region:rollup2
now. And so some of the

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:35.401 region:rollup2
traditional foster homes are not

00:15:34.801 --> 00:15:38.871 region:rollup2
able or aren't going to be

00:15:35.401 --> 00:15:40.907 region:rollup2
moving into that higher level.

00:15:38.871 --> 00:15:41.541 region:rollup2
We are in Alameda county and

00:15:40.907 --> 00:15:43.242 region:rollup2
another way we're thinking out

00:15:41.541 --> 00:15:45.178 region:rollup2
of the box is we can't just rely

00:15:43.242 --> 00:15:45.711 region:rollup2
on government. Funding although

00:15:45.178 --> 00:15:46.879 region:rollup2
it's government funding is

00:15:45.711 --> 00:15:49.282 region:rollup2
there.

00:15:46.879 --> 00:15:51.083 region:rollup2
That we have partners who want

00:15:49.282 --> 00:15:52.985 region:rollup2
to step up our faith community

00:15:51.083 --> 00:15:55.154 region:rollup2
want to step up. Our of

00:15:52.985 --> 00:15:57.089 region:rollup2
philanthropic community wants to

00:15:55.154 --> 00:15:58.825 region:rollup2
step up. So one of the efforts

00:15:57.089 --> 00:16:00.827 region:rollup2
that we're doing right now which

00:15:58.825 --> 00:16:01.360 region:rollup2
is both Alameda and Contra Costa

00:16:00.827 --> 00:16:01.894 region:rollup2
is that I reached out to

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.129 region:rollup2
Catholic charities to the

00:16:01.894 --> 00:16:05.231 region:rollup2
bishop.

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:07.200 region:rollup2
A bishop Michael barber who is

00:16:05.231 --> 00:16:09.235 region:rollup2
working with us and we are

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:13.005 region:rollup2
transforming an old rectory into

00:16:09.235 --> 00:16:15.041 region:rollup2
a safe house. Long term housing

00:16:13.005 --> 00:16:15.274 region:rollup2
therapeutic housing for minor

00:16:15.041 --> 00:16:17.376 region:rollup2
girls.

00:16:15.274 --> 00:16:19.378 region:rollup2
Or those that identifies female

00:16:17.376 --> 00:16:21.080 region:rollup2
that will open this spring it's

00:16:19.378 --> 00:16:23.182 region:rollup2
called Claire's house. And at

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:25.051 region:rollup2
the projection is five houses

00:16:23.182 --> 00:16:27.119 region:rollup2
over the next five years in

00:16:25.051 --> 00:16:28.955 region:rollup2
Alameda and Contra Costa county

00:16:27.119 --> 00:16:31.023 region:rollup2
that our partnership with our

00:16:28.955 --> 00:16:31.624 region:rollup2
faith community. Who and our

00:16:31.023 --> 00:16:33.292 region:rollup2
faith and the people in our

00:16:31.624 --> 00:16:35.261 region:rollup2
community as volunteers? Through

00:16:33.292 --> 00:16:37.263 region:rollup2
the efforts of Claire's house we

00:16:35.261 --> 00:16:39.298 region:rollup2
have talked to all the parishes

00:16:37.263 --> 00:16:41.133 region:rollup2
in Alameda Contra Costa we have

00:16:39.298 --> 00:16:42.969 region:rollup2
over a thousand people have

00:16:41.133 --> 00:16:45.238 region:rollup2
signed up to be volunteers. To

00:16:42.969 --> 00:16:47.173 region:rollup2
help work and support and help

00:16:45.238 --> 00:16:48.975 region:rollup2
the healing of these children so

00:16:47.173 --> 00:16:51.143 region:rollup2
that when they can get beyond.

00:16:48.975 --> 00:16:53.179 region:rollup2
Their exploitive experience they

00:16:51.143 --> 00:16:55.314 region:rollup2
can have the same opportunities

00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:56.983 region:rollup2
and future that we hope for all

00:16:55.314 --> 00:16:58.985 region:rollup2
our children.

00:16:56.983 --> 00:17:01.153 region:rollup2
Housing is a big issue. Out the

00:16:58.985 --> 00:17:03.089 region:rollup2
role of law enforcement change

00:17:01.153 --> 00:17:04.824 region:rollup2
the last couple of years and

00:17:03.089 --> 00:17:06.926 region:rollup2
it's been evolving but we change

00:17:04.824 --> 00:17:07.560 region:rollup2
but that our legislature changed

00:17:06.926 --> 00:17:09.161 region:rollup2
it. For sure sing case there's

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:11.097 region:rollup2
any questions and that is

00:17:09.161 --> 00:17:12.932 region:rollup2
children are victims of human

00:17:11.097 --> 00:17:15.034 region:rollup2
trafficking they're not

00:17:12.932 --> 00:17:17.303 region:rollup2
perpetrators of crime. So we are

00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:19.272 region:rollup2
we have re frame the way the law

00:17:17.303 --> 00:17:22.975 region:rollup2
enforcement is working with

00:17:19.272 --> 00:17:23.543 region:rollup2
exploited miners. In large part

00:17:22.975 --> 00:17:24.911 region:rollup2
of being their protectors.

00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:27.079 region:rollup2
Rather than.

00:17:24.911 --> 00:17:29.115 region:rollup2
You know bringing kids into

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:29.749 region:rollup2
juvenile justice system. And I

00:17:29.115 --> 00:17:31.317 region:rollup2
will say that again we've been

00:17:29.749 --> 00:17:33.019 region:rollup2
involving to this point for a

00:17:31.317 --> 00:17:35.021 region:rollup2
long time so the law which is

00:17:33.019 --> 00:17:37.056 region:rollup2
the final part the broadest to

00:17:35.021 --> 00:17:39.125 region:rollup2
there. But we just created a new

00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:41.127 region:rollup2
protocol on using law

00:17:39.125 --> 00:17:43.062 region:rollup2
enforcement advisers from all

00:17:41.127 --> 00:17:44.997 region:rollup2
over the state for law

00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:45.665 region:rollup2
enforcement so they can re frame

00:17:44.997 --> 00:17:47.366 region:rollup2
how they're going to interact in

00:17:45.665 --> 00:17:49.302 region:rollup2
the community. There is a lot of

00:17:47.366 --> 00:17:51.237 region:rollup2
frustration about where can I

00:17:49.302 --> 00:17:53.239 region:rollup2
take this child is on the street

00:17:51.237 --> 00:17:54.974 region:rollup2
or I rescue out the internet one

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:56.943 region:rollup2
of my supposed to do next.

00:17:54.974 --> 00:17:57.443 region:rollup2
And we're trying to answer those

00:17:56.943 --> 00:17:58.945 region:rollup2
questions and help law

00:17:57.443 --> 00:18:00.980 region:rollup2
enforcement and all communities

00:17:58.945 --> 00:18:01.547 region:rollup2
figure out what that looks like.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:03.316 region:rollup2
And then another area we

00:18:01.547 --> 00:18:05.084 region:rollup2
discovered is that we know that

00:18:03.316 --> 00:18:07.053 region:rollup2
a lot of children a lot of

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:09.021 region:rollup2
adults who are trafficked either

00:18:07.053 --> 00:18:09.622 region:rollup2
labor or sex traffic. Are going

00:18:09.021 --> 00:18:11.390 region:rollup2
to the hospitals and going to

00:18:09.622 --> 00:18:13.326 region:rollup2
clinics for care for medical

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:15.227 region:rollup2
treatment so we're working with

00:18:13.326 --> 00:18:17.296 region:rollup2
all of our hospitals in Alameda

00:18:15.227 --> 00:18:19.231 region:rollup2
county. Developing a medical

00:18:17.296 --> 00:18:22.969 region:rollup2
protocols doctor Mays is a

00:18:19.231 --> 00:18:23.602 region:rollup2
member of the heel network.

00:18:22.969 --> 00:18:25.404 region:rollup2
Yeah and they're an adviser to

00:18:23.602 --> 00:18:27.373 region:rollup2
us so we are now working with

00:18:25.404 --> 00:18:29.342 region:rollup2
each of those hospitals and

00:18:27.373 --> 00:18:30.977 region:rollup2
physicians and we're looking at

00:18:29.342 --> 00:18:33.079 region:rollup2
potentially proposing

00:18:30.977 --> 00:18:33.679 region:rollup2
legislation. Or working with

00:18:33.079 --> 00:18:35.481 region:rollup2
medical schools to make it a

00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:37.149 region:rollup2
mandatory part of their medical

00:18:35.481 --> 00:18:38.985 region:rollup2
training. To learn and

00:18:37.149 --> 00:18:41.287 region:rollup2
understand human trafficking.

00:18:38.985 --> 00:18:45.091 region:rollup2
And and then lastly.

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:47.193 region:rollup2
You know we many years back.

00:18:45.091 --> 00:18:49.061 region:rollup2
When I when we got more

00:18:47.193 --> 00:18:51.097 region:rollup2
organized and that was in the

00:18:49.061 --> 00:18:52.999 region:rollup2
nineties. That we created what

00:18:51.097 --> 00:18:55.134 region:rollup2
we what I call he'd watch human

00:18:52.999 --> 00:18:55.668 region:rollup2
exploitation trafficking and the

00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:57.336 region:rollup2
watch is where we engage

00:18:55.668 --> 00:19:01.040 region:rollup2
community. And this is a five

00:18:57.336 --> 00:19:03.142 region:rollup2
point strategy for communities

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:05.111 region:rollup2
to use as a guide. What we do in

00:19:03.142 --> 00:19:07.079 region:rollup2
Alameda Contra Costa county may

00:19:05.111 --> 00:19:09.081 region:rollup2
not be the same in Fresno or?

00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:09.649 region:rollup2
Merced county but this is a

00:19:09.081 --> 00:19:11.384 region:rollup2
guide that will it help all

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:13.252 region:rollup2
communities. And the five

00:19:11.384 --> 00:19:13.853 region:rollup2
strategies are what working with

00:19:13.252 --> 00:19:15.454 region:rollup2
law enforcement to help train

00:19:13.853 --> 00:19:17.356 region:rollup2
law enforcement because very

00:19:15.454 --> 00:19:19.258 region:rollup2
often they are the first

00:19:17.356 --> 00:19:21.027 region:rollup2
responders they're the first to

00:19:19.258 --> 00:19:23.029 region:rollup2
have encountered to encounter

00:19:21.027 --> 00:19:25.031 region:rollup2
someone. Is being trafficked the

00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:27.033 region:rollup2
second was we have to prosecute

00:19:25.031 --> 00:19:29.035 region:rollup2
traffickers. With the many

00:19:27.033 --> 00:19:31.037 region:rollup2
traffickers will continue

00:19:29.035 --> 00:19:33.272 region:rollup2
exploiting and continue finding

00:19:31.037 --> 00:19:35.307 region:rollup2
children to exploit and adults

00:19:33.272 --> 00:19:37.176 region:rollup2
to exploit so they we just have

00:19:35.307 --> 00:19:39.412 region:rollup2
to hold them accountable. The

00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:41.213 region:rollup2
third one is. To make sure that

00:19:39.412 --> 00:19:43.382 region:rollup2
we have strong community support

00:19:41.213 --> 00:19:45.317 region:rollup2
and by that I mean and you're

00:19:43.382 --> 00:19:47.053 region:rollup2
gonna hear from the panel later

00:19:45.317 --> 00:19:47.687 region:rollup2
so I won't go into it. But

00:19:47.053 --> 00:19:49.088 region:rollup2
organizations that are in place

00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:49.321 region:rollup2
to help.

00:19:49.088 --> 00:19:51.223 region:rollup2
Those.

00:19:49.321 --> 00:19:53.092 region:rollup2
As they are separated away or

00:19:51.223 --> 00:19:53.292 region:rollup2
moving into their recovery.

00:19:53.092 --> 00:19:55.327 region:rollup2
That.

00:19:53.292 --> 00:19:57.163 region:rollup2
Those nonprofit non government

00:19:55.327 --> 00:19:59.098 region:rollup2
organizations need to be

00:19:57.163 --> 00:19:59.665 region:rollup2
supported and strong.

00:19:59.098 --> 00:20:01.434 region:rollup2
We've been changing the law

00:19:59.665 --> 00:20:03.135 region:rollup2
since the early since the late

00:20:01.434 --> 00:20:05.071 region:rollup2
nineties thank goodness to

00:20:03.135 --> 00:20:07.173 region:rollup2
members like assembly member

00:20:05.071 --> 00:20:09.108 region:rollup2
Grayson who hears the cry and

00:20:07.173 --> 00:20:11.243 region:rollup2
understands the need to change

00:20:09.108 --> 00:20:13.212 region:rollup2
the laws. And then lastly that

00:20:11.243 --> 00:20:13.746 region:rollup2
it we have to engage our

00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:15.081 region:rollup2
community this is human

00:20:13.746 --> 00:20:17.516 region:rollup2
trafficking awareness month.

00:20:15.081 --> 00:20:19.452 region:rollup2
We've we have to engage our

00:20:17.516 --> 00:20:21.587 region:rollup2
community because. This is a

00:20:19.452 --> 00:20:23.155 region:rollup2
crime that is hidden in plain

00:20:21.587 --> 00:20:25.424 region:rollup2
sight. And the more we.

00:20:23.155 --> 00:20:27.226 region:rollup2
Have our community be the eyes

00:20:25.424 --> 00:20:29.128 region:rollup2
and ears and recognize human

00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:29.795 region:rollup2
trafficking and then a resource

00:20:29.128 --> 00:20:31.564 region:rollup2
for what they can do once they

00:20:29.795 --> 00:20:35.134 region:rollup2
see that. The more we are going

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:37.169 region:rollup2
to. Change the whole paradigm of

00:20:35.134 --> 00:20:39.171 region:rollup2
this community of this society.

00:20:37.169 --> 00:20:39.805 region:rollup2
That would allow this to exist

00:20:39.171 --> 00:20:41.574 region:rollup2
the last thing I say is we did

00:20:39.805 --> 00:20:43.676 region:rollup2
Pat the legislature did pass a

00:20:41.574 --> 00:20:45.511 region:rollup2
law. A few years ago it was SB

00:20:43.676 --> 00:20:47.413 region:rollup2
eleven ninety three which

00:20:45.511 --> 00:20:49.248 region:rollup2
requires. Thirteen different

00:20:47.413 --> 00:20:51.317 region:rollup2
types of businesses to post a

00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:51.817 region:rollup2
poster. That has some

00:20:51.317 --> 00:20:53.486 region:rollup2
information about human

00:20:51.817 --> 00:20:55.554 region:rollup2
trafficking but importantly the

00:20:53.486 --> 00:20:57.089 region:rollup2
national hotline and we've added

00:20:55.554 --> 00:20:59.458 region:rollup2
the text line.

00:20:57.089 --> 00:21:01.293 region:rollup2
I can tell you that we've done

00:20:59.458 --> 00:21:03.262 region:rollup2
days of action with the with the

00:21:01.293 --> 00:21:05.464 region:rollup2
family justice center. In a

00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:07.466 region:rollup2
country Costa we do I'm all the

00:21:05.464 --> 00:21:09.201 region:rollup2
time in Alameda county there are

00:21:07.466 --> 00:21:11.170 region:rollup2
wonderful volunteers to do that.

00:21:09.201 --> 00:21:13.506 region:rollup2
We created an app

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:15.341 region:rollup2
to really engage communities so

00:21:13.506 --> 00:21:17.376 region:rollup2
when I go to a restaurant if I

00:21:15.341 --> 00:21:19.245 region:rollup2
don't see the sign I can go on

00:21:17.376 --> 00:21:19.812 region:rollup2
the app. Call at that restaurant

00:21:19.245 --> 00:21:21.247 region:rollup2
push a red button that says

00:21:19.812 --> 00:21:23.482 region:rollup2
they're out of compliance with

00:21:21.247 --> 00:21:25.217 region:rollup2
California law this isn't just a

00:21:23.482 --> 00:21:27.153 region:rollup2
feel good I wish everybody would

00:21:25.217 --> 00:21:29.188 region:rollup2
do it. This is the law.

00:21:27.153 --> 00:21:29.822 region:rollup2
And so we push the button the

00:21:29.188 --> 00:21:31.624 region:rollup2
district attorney's office the

00:21:29.822 --> 00:21:33.359 region:rollup2
attorney general's office have

00:21:31.624 --> 00:21:35.528 region:rollup2
the authority to do

00:21:33.359 --> 00:21:37.563 region:rollup2
administrative. Enforcement the

00:21:35.528 --> 00:21:41.233 region:rollup2
fine for failing to put them

00:21:37.563 --> 00:21:41.867 region:rollup2
poster up in a conspicuous place

00:21:41.233 --> 00:21:43.402 region:rollup2
is five hundred dollars for the

00:21:41.867 --> 00:21:45.171 region:rollup2
first offense and a thousand

00:21:43.402 --> 00:21:47.473 region:rollup2
dollars for every offense after.

00:21:45.171 --> 00:21:49.375 region:rollup2
And it is my feeling that and

00:21:47.473 --> 00:21:51.177 region:rollup2
this is what we're doing in my

00:21:49.375 --> 00:21:51.777 region:rollup2
county that as we find

00:21:51.177 --> 00:21:52.344 region:rollup2
businesses that don't comply

00:21:51.777 --> 00:21:53.579 region:rollup2
with the law comply with the

00:21:52.344 --> 00:21:55.548 region:rollup2
law.

00:21:53.579 --> 00:21:57.416 region:rollup2
That some of it can fund the

00:21:55.548 --> 00:21:59.451 region:rollup2
compliance officers but that can

00:21:57.416 --> 00:22:01.487 region:rollup2
go right back into a pot. For

00:21:59.451 --> 00:22:03.189 region:rollup2
services for those that have

00:22:01.487 --> 00:22:03.789 region:rollup2
been exploited.

00:22:03.189 --> 00:22:05.391 region:rollup2
The businesses that are not

00:22:03.789 --> 00:22:07.293 region:rollup2
following the law can help us

00:22:05.391 --> 00:22:09.228 region:rollup2
build the networks and the

00:22:07.293 --> 00:22:11.263 region:rollup2
resources to help people get

00:22:09.228 --> 00:22:11.864 region:rollup2
beyond this experience so. If I

00:22:11.263 --> 00:22:13.499 region:rollup2
know country Costa we've been

00:22:11.864 --> 00:22:15.634 region:rollup2
uploading all the businesses

00:22:13.499 --> 00:22:17.503 region:rollup2
into the database so they can

00:22:15.634 --> 00:22:19.672 region:rollup2
continue to. Days of action

00:22:17.503 --> 00:22:21.240 region:rollup2
through the leadership of the

00:22:19.672 --> 00:22:21.807 region:rollup2
justice centers.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.576 region:rollup2
And any other community in

00:22:21.807 --> 00:22:25.611 region:rollup2
California is welcome to it we

00:22:23.576 --> 00:22:27.279 region:rollup2
have the apt we will share it

00:22:25.611 --> 00:22:29.315 region:rollup2
with anyone.

00:22:27.279 --> 00:22:29.949 region:rollup2
And let's get those days of

00:22:29.315 --> 00:22:31.584 region:rollup2
action going throughout all of

00:22:29.949 --> 00:22:32.184 region:rollup2
our cities and all of our

00:22:31.584 --> 00:22:33.352 region:rollup2

Nationwide worldwide but

00:23:13.826 --> 00:23:17.529 region:rollup2
particularly in California

00:23:15.494 --> 00:23:19.531 region:rollup2
really staggering grew up with

00:23:17.529 --> 00:23:20.099 region:rollup2
no choice but to lead the fight

00:23:19.531 --> 00:23:23.302 region:rollup2

At the department of justice we

00:23:23.969 --> 00:23:27.306 region:rollup2
use what's called the four peas

00:23:25.504 --> 00:23:29.341 region:rollup2
approach to combating

00:23:27.306 --> 00:23:33.312 region:rollup2

00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:51.497 region:rollup2
work on each of those areas.

00:23:49.328 --> 00:23:53.332 region:rollup2
Most recently on the prevention

00:23:51.497 --> 00:23:55.434 region:rollup2

education in public schools

throughout the state.

00:24:04.143 --> 00:24:07.880 region:rollup2
I'm.

00:24:05.411 --> 00:24:09.782 region:rollup2
That education helps students to

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.517 region:rollup2
protect themselves and protect

00:24:09.782 --> 00:24:13.352 region:rollup2
each other and make sure that

00:24:11.517 --> 00:24:13.919 region:rollup2
every young person understands

00:24:13.352 --> 00:24:17.389 region:rollup2
that commercial faxes not a

00:24:13.919 --> 00:24:19.692 region:rollup2
victimless crime.

00:24:17.389 --> 00:24:21.493 region:rollup2
The curriculum called protectors

00:24:19.692 --> 00:24:22.094 region:rollup2
originally rolled out a role

00:24:21.493 --> 00:24:23.662 region:rollup2
communities than there is an

00:24:22.094 --> 00:24:25.397 region:rollup2
expansion and will now be

00:24:23.662 --> 00:24:27.766 region:rollup2
available to students statewide.

00:24:25.397 --> 00:24:29.902 region:rollup2
And data is also being collected

00:24:27.766 --> 00:24:33.439 region:rollup2
to evaluate the effectiveness of

00:24:29.902 --> 00:24:34.073 region:rollup2
this educational curriculum.

00:24:33.439 --> 00:24:35.708 region:rollup2
Data collected from seventh and

00:24:34.073 --> 00:24:37.743 region:rollup2
ninth graders show that ninety

00:24:35.708 --> 00:24:39.511 region:rollup2
five percent of the students who

00:24:37.743 --> 00:24:40.145 region:rollup2
have been educated. With this

00:24:39.511 --> 00:24:41.747 region:rollup2
curriculum felt that they could

00:24:40.145 --> 00:24:45.417 region:rollup2
identify trafficker tactics

00:24:41.747 --> 00:24:47.553 region:rollup2
after receiving that training.

00:24:45.417 --> 00:24:49.421 region:rollup2
In addition our office continues

00:24:47.553 --> 00:24:51.423 region:rollup2
to enforce.

00:24:49.421 --> 00:24:53.392 region:rollup2
And implement.

00:24:51.423 --> 00:24:54.026 region:rollup2
Statewide anti trafficking

00:24:53.392 --> 00:24:55.594 region:rollup2

The department office also works

00:25:45.444 --> 00:25:49.748 region:rollup2
The department of justice houses

00:25:47.546 --> 00:25:53.385 region:rollup2
a multi agency task force in San

00:25:49.748 --> 00:25:53.986 region:rollup2

00:25:59.425 --> 00:26:03.796 region:rollup2
And that it has for tape task

00:26:01.894 --> 00:26:05.664 region:rollup2

with much success.

00:26:09.435 --> 00:26:12.004 region:rollup2
Last year the task force

00:26:11.503 --> 00:26:13.472 region:rollup2

00:26:12.004 --> 00:26:15.808 region:rollup2
traffickers.

00:26:13.472 --> 00:26:17.776 region:rollup2
Eighty nine of those traffickers

00:26:15.808 --> 00:26:19.478 region:rollup2
faced state charges for face to

00:26:17.776 --> 00:26:23.482 region:rollup2
federal charges.

00:26:19.478 --> 00:26:24.082 region:rollup2
In addition to those charges.

00:26:23.482 --> 00:26:25.818 region:rollup2
Are the task force if this

00:26:27.453 --> 00:26:31.523 region:rollup2
And conducted twenty one

00:26:29.488 --> 00:26:33.425 region:rollup2

00:26:37.463 --> 00:26:41.533 region:rollup2
Those trainings are geared

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:42.201 region:rollup2
towards raising awareness and

00:26:41.533 --> 00:26:45.471 region:rollup2
making sure that everyone in the

00:26:47.873 --> 00:26:51.810 region:rollup2
when they see it. And knows what

00:26:49.875 --> 00:26:55.547 region:rollup2

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:57.549 region:rollup2
identified at.

00:26:55.547 --> 00:26:59.751 region:rollup2
In addition it.

00:26:57.549 --> 00:27:01.620 region:rollup2
This past year the department of

00:26:59.751 --> 00:27:02.087 region:rollup2
justice is filed a number of top

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.522 region:rollup2

traffickers.

00:27:03.522 --> 00:27:08.060 region:rollup2
One such case was filed. In the.

00:27:07.526 --> 00:27:09.528 region:rollup2

00:27:09.528 --> 00:27:13.532 region:rollup2
Three defendants who were

00:27:11.663 --> 00:27:15.667 region:rollup2
charged with.

00:27:13.532 --> 00:27:17.503 region:rollup2
Fraudulently procuring a luxury

residential units

00:27:17.503 --> 00:27:21.740 region:rollup2
and cars which they then

00:27:19.838 --> 00:27:23.842 region:rollup2
proceeded to use to traffic

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:29.581 region:rollup2
thirteen victims up and down the

00:27:23.842 --> 00:27:31.550 region:rollup2
state. Including eight miners.

00:27:29.581 --> 00:27:32.117 region:rollup2
Just a couple of weeks ago two

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:33.886 region:rollup2

00:27:32.117 --> 00:27:35.621 region:rollup2
guilty. Wanted twenty eight

years and one to eleven years

00:27:35.621 --> 00:27:39.558 region:rollup2
I'm an outcome we are very

00:27:36.188 --> 00:27:40.159 region:rollup2
pleased with.

00:27:39.558 --> 00:27:41.894 region:rollup2
In the course of this work we

00:27:40.159 --> 00:27:43.562 region:rollup2
also take I very careful steps

00:27:41.894 --> 00:27:47.566 region:rollup2
to protect.

00:27:43.562 --> 00:27:48.167 region:rollup2
The survivors who we encounter.

00:27:47.566 --> 00:27:49.868 region:rollup2
We work closely with service

00:27:48.167 --> 00:27:51.570 region:rollup2
providers very early on from

00:27:49.868 --> 00:27:54.039 region:rollup2
that very.

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:55.607 region:rollup2
Start of our investigations to

00:27:54.039 --> 00:27:57.976 region:rollup2
make sure that.

00:27:55.607 --> 00:27:59.645 region:rollup2
Victims and survivors needs are

00:27:57.976 --> 00:28:00.245 region:rollup2
met.

00:27:59.645 --> 00:28:02.047 region:rollup2
At each step of the way both

00:28:00.245 --> 00:28:03.982 region:rollup2
mental health needs it though

00:28:02.047 --> 00:28:05.851 region:rollup2
think that physically than any

00:28:03.982 --> 00:28:07.619 region:rollup2
other needs add that. The

00:28:05.851 --> 00:28:09.788 region:rollup2
individuals may have.

00:28:07.619 --> 00:28:11.623 region:rollup2
The exact nature of the support

00:28:09.788 --> 00:28:13.692 region:rollup2
and services that are provided.

00:28:11.623 --> 00:28:15.827 region:rollup2
If of course determined in a

00:28:13.692 --> 00:28:17.629 region:rollup2
substantial part by the needs of

00:28:15.827 --> 00:28:19.631 region:rollup2
that particular individual.

00:28:17.629 --> 00:28:22.034 region:rollup2
But they can include a.

00:28:19.631 --> 00:28:23.635 region:rollup2
Housing mental health the drug

00:28:22.034 --> 00:28:27.806 region:rollup2
and alcohol counseling.

00:28:23.635 --> 00:28:29.708 region:rollup2
Emergency housing in basic

00:28:27.806 --> 00:28:31.677 region:rollup2
needs like medical care food and

00:28:29.708 --> 00:28:33.645 region:rollup2
clothing.

00:28:31.677 --> 00:28:35.647 region:rollup2
Service providers we work with

00:28:33.645 --> 00:28:36.215 region:rollup2
are also available to shepherd

00:28:35.647 --> 00:28:37.683 region:rollup2
survivors through the court

00:28:36.215 --> 00:28:39.952 region:rollup2
process.

00:28:37.683 --> 00:28:41.987 region:rollup2
And at that survivors election

00:28:39.952 --> 00:28:42.554 region:rollup2
it to stay on that support them

00:28:41.987 --> 00:28:45.657 region:rollup2
even after the close of the

00:28:42.554 --> 00:28:46.291 region:rollup2
case.

00:28:45.657 --> 00:28:47.659 region:rollup2
Additionally attorneys in office

00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:48.293 region:rollup2
take.

00:28:47.659 --> 00:28:51.663 region:rollup2
Take steps to ease the burden of

00:28:48.293 --> 00:28:53.799 region:rollup2
it.

00:28:51.663 --> 00:28:55.567 region:rollup2
That survivors have facing a

00:28:53.799 --> 00:28:57.736 region:rollup2
trafficker in court.

00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:59.771 region:rollup2
I am for survivor that is a very

00:28:57.736 --> 00:29:01.940 region:rollup2
very challenging oftentimes most

00:28:59.771 --> 00:29:03.942 region:rollup2
times. To go to court. To look

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:05.644 region:rollup2
their trafficker in their faith

00:29:03.942 --> 00:29:09.748 region:rollup2
in the face and a half to

00:29:05.644 --> 00:29:11.750 region:rollup2
describe sexual encounters. And.

00:29:09.748 --> 00:29:12.384 region:rollup2
Other awful things that.

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:15.721 region:rollup2
That took place while they were

00:29:12.384 --> 00:29:17.723 region:rollup2
being trafficked.

00:29:15.721 --> 00:29:19.591 region:rollup2
We try to assist in the.

00:29:17.723 --> 00:29:21.660 region:rollup2
To assist them in that endeavor

00:29:19.591 --> 00:29:22.294 region:rollup2
and to make it. Too easy the

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:23.629 region:rollup2
burden to the fact that we can

00:29:22.294 --> 00:29:27.633 region:rollup2
we do a few things.

00:29:23.629 --> 00:29:29.601 region:rollup2
The first is we will.

00:29:27.633 --> 00:29:31.670 region:rollup2
Take survivors who are who are

00:29:29.601 --> 00:29:33.872 region:rollup2
at anticipated to testify to

00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:34.539 region:rollup2
court in advance of whatever

00:29:33.872 --> 00:29:35.674 region:rollup2
hearing or have to buying in to

00:29:34.539 --> 00:29:39.645 region:rollup2
do a courtroom that that.

00:29:35.674 --> 00:29:41.780 region:rollup2
I that enables the survivor to

00:29:39.645 --> 00:29:43.749 region:rollup2
get a lay of the land to see the

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:44.349 region:rollup2
court room to go up on the

00:29:43.749 --> 00:29:44.950 region:rollup2
witness stand that actually

00:29:44.349 --> 00:29:45.651 region:rollup2
experience what that will feel

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:48.020 region:rollup2
like.

00:29:45.651 --> 00:29:49.921 region:rollup2
And even though it's. Generally

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:51.657 region:rollup2
empty courtroom at that time but

00:29:49.921 --> 00:29:54.126 region:rollup2
to have that first step.

00:29:51.657 --> 00:29:56.161 region:rollup2
In feeling quite that testimony

00:29:54.126 --> 00:29:57.829 region:rollup2
will feel like you were able to

00:29:56.161 --> 00:29:59.665 region:rollup2
upgrade to answer any questions.

00:29:57.829 --> 00:30:01.733 region:rollup2
And.

00:29:59.665 --> 00:30:02.301 region:rollup2
To do anything we can to to warm

00:30:01.733 --> 00:30:03.669 region:rollup2
up the environment for that.

00:30:02.301 --> 00:30:05.671 region:rollup2
Individual up.

00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:09.675 region:rollup2
We also work.

00:30:05.671 --> 00:30:11.777 region:rollup2
Arrange for. Anything survivor

00:30:09.675 --> 00:30:12.311 region:rollup2
who is testifying who would like

00:30:11.777 --> 00:30:13.845 region:rollup2
to have a support person

00:30:12.311 --> 00:30:14.446 region:rollup2
available to actually have that

00:30:13.845 --> 00:30:15.714 region:rollup2
person up on the witness stand

00:30:14.446 --> 00:30:17.749 region:rollup2
with them to.

00:30:15.714 --> 00:30:19.818 region:rollup2
To provide additional support at

00:30:17.749 --> 00:30:22.054 region:rollup2
the time of testimony in front

00:30:19.818 --> 00:30:23.722 region:rollup2
of. Add the trafficker in the

00:30:22.054 --> 00:30:25.724 region:rollup2
public a Jerry.

00:30:23.722 --> 00:30:28.093 region:rollup2
And lastly we.

00:30:25.724 --> 00:30:29.895 region:rollup2
Would go out of our way to make

00:30:28.093 --> 00:30:33.699 region:rollup2
sure that the audience is filled

00:30:29.895 --> 00:30:34.199 region:rollup2
with familiar faces and. Add

00:30:33.699 --> 00:30:34.766 region:rollup2
that there is additional

00:30:34.199 --> 00:30:35.734 region:rollup2
security in the courtroom so

00:30:34.766 --> 00:30:38.103 region:rollup2
that I need.

00:30:35.734 --> 00:30:40.138 region:rollup2
Survivor who we have to testify

00:30:38.103 --> 00:30:43.775 region:rollup2
knows that they are safe and

00:30:40.138 --> 00:30:45.744 region:rollup2
supported.

00:30:43.775 --> 00:30:46.378 region:rollup2
As this collaborative approach

00:30:45.744 --> 00:30:47.779 region:rollup2
with service providers have you

00:30:46.378 --> 00:30:49.781 region:rollup2
but many successes.

00:30:47.779 --> 00:30:53.919 region:rollup2
I purchased a few examples.

00:30:49.781 --> 00:30:55.721 region:rollup2
I last year on. That. One case

00:30:53.919 --> 00:30:57.756 region:rollup2
we worked at the service

00:30:55.721 --> 00:30:59.925 region:rollup2
provider to get. Eighteen age a

00:30:57.756 --> 00:31:00.425 region:rollup2
trafficking victim back into

00:30:59.925 --> 00:31:01.760 region:rollup2
school so that she could

00:31:00.425 --> 00:31:05.731 region:rollup2
receive.

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:06.298 region:rollup2
Her GED and she is now taking

00:31:05.731 --> 00:31:07.766 region:rollup2
classes at a local community

00:31:06.298 --> 00:31:09.768 region:rollup2
college.

00:31:07.766 --> 00:31:12.204 region:rollup2
Have.

00:31:09.768 --> 00:31:13.805 region:rollup2
And more recently we at the

00:31:12.204 --> 00:31:15.807 region:rollup2
citadel picked on.

00:31:13.805 --> 00:31:16.408 region:rollup2
Who?

00:31:15.807 --> 00:31:18.143 region:rollup2
With an ad desperate need of

00:31:16.408 --> 00:31:21.813 region:rollup2
substance abuse treatment and

00:31:18.143 --> 00:31:22.481 region:rollup2
after. Getting.

00:31:21.813 --> 00:31:23.849 region:rollup2
Part way through that treatment.

00:31:22.481 --> 00:31:26.051 region:rollup2
That.

00:31:23.849 --> 00:31:27.953 region:rollup2
That survivor was able to share

00:31:26.051 --> 00:31:28.587 region:rollup2
with us that this was the first

00:31:27.953 --> 00:31:29.821 region:rollup2
time in ten years that she had

00:31:28.587 --> 00:31:32.157 region:rollup2
left.

00:31:29.821 --> 00:31:33.825 region:rollup2
The life and was not under the

00:31:32.157 --> 00:31:37.829 region:rollup2
control of a trafficker Pam.

00:31:33.825 --> 00:31:38.397 region:rollup2
And that she had.

00:31:37.829 --> 00:31:41.833 region:rollup2
As a result the calm the a

00:31:38.397 --> 00:31:42.367 region:rollup2
better mother to her children.

00:31:41.833 --> 00:31:44.136 region:rollup2
Finally we partner with

00:31:42.367 --> 00:31:46.104 region:rollup2
government agencies advocacy

00:31:44.136 --> 00:31:50.008 region:rollup2
groups and service providers to

00:31:46.104 --> 00:31:51.877 region:rollup2
train a broad range of people up

00:31:50.008 --> 00:31:52.410 region:rollup2
and down the state.

00:31:51.877 --> 00:31:53.845 region:rollup2
I in the identification

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:54.446 region:rollup2
reporting with you in

00:31:53.845 --> 00:31:55.881 region:rollup2
trafficking it's often these

00:31:54.446 --> 00:31:58.183 region:rollup2
folks did not law enforcement.

00:31:55.881 --> 00:31:59.985 region:rollup2
Who are best positioned to

00:31:58.183 --> 00:32:00.519 region:rollup2
observe trafficking in their

00:31:59.985 --> 00:32:02.154 region:rollup2
community either in their

00:32:00.519 --> 00:32:02.721 region:rollup2
workplace as? For example we've

00:32:02.154 --> 00:32:04.089 region:rollup2
trained government employees

00:32:02.721 --> 00:32:06.124 region:rollup2
who.

00:32:04.089 --> 00:32:07.859 region:rollup2
Perform building in code

00:32:06.124 --> 00:32:09.895 region:rollup2
enforcement work.

00:32:07.859 --> 00:32:10.529 region:rollup2
In the identification of

00:32:09.895 --> 00:32:12.230 region:rollup2
traffickers in those locations

00:32:10.529 --> 00:32:13.865 region:rollup2
I've trafficking victims in

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:15.834 region:rollup2
those locations.

00:32:13.865 --> 00:32:16.334 region:rollup2
We've trained healthcare

00:32:15.834 --> 00:32:18.103 region:rollup2
hospitality workers are

00:32:16.334 --> 00:32:20.238 region:rollup2
identification of trafficking

00:32:18.103 --> 00:32:21.907 region:rollup2
victims in the hospitals and

00:32:20.238 --> 00:32:24.109 region:rollup2
hotels.

00:32:21.907 --> 00:32:26.278 region:rollup2
And we've trained teachers who

00:32:24.109 --> 00:32:28.180 region:rollup2
are. Around here the whispers in

00:32:26.278 --> 00:32:31.917 region:rollup2
the hallway into notice a change

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:33.852 region:rollup2
in a child's demeanor behavior.

00:32:31.917 --> 00:32:35.987 region:rollup2
Despite our best efforts there

00:32:33.852 --> 00:32:36.455 region:rollup2
are of course still gaps in our

00:32:35.987 --> 00:32:37.889 region:rollup2
sport I've trafficking

00:32:36.455 --> 00:32:40.058 region:rollup2
survivors.

00:32:37.889 --> 00:32:41.927 region:rollup2
I would reiterate that point

00:32:40.058 --> 00:32:43.962 region:rollup2
that the a rally made about how

00:32:41.927 --> 00:32:45.831 region:rollup2
things specifically for I.

00:32:43.962 --> 00:32:47.999 region:rollup2
juvenile trafficking survivors.

00:32:45.831 --> 00:32:51.803 region:rollup2
Do the Taliban that forms

00:32:47.999 --> 00:32:52.237 region:rollup2
between it I trafficking

00:32:51.803 --> 00:32:55.874 region:rollup2
survivors. And their

00:32:52.237 --> 00:32:56.441 region:rollup2
traffickers.

00:32:55.874 --> 00:32:58.310 region:rollup2
Juvenile survivors signatory

00:32:56.441 --> 00:32:58.944 region:rollup2
flee right away from whatever

00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:59.878 region:rollup2
placement it is that they're put

00:32:58.944 --> 00:33:02.247 region:rollup2
in.

00:32:59.878 --> 00:33:03.882 region:rollup2
I despite law enforcement's best

00:33:02.247 --> 00:33:06.017 region:rollup2
efforts to keep them safe.

00:33:03.882 --> 00:33:08.119 region:rollup2
Fortunately there is a

00:33:06.017 --> 00:33:10.188 region:rollup2
significant shortage of safe

00:33:08.119 --> 00:33:11.957 region:rollup2
victim oriented placements for

00:33:10.188 --> 00:33:14.292 region:rollup2
juveniles who been trafficked.

00:33:11.957 --> 00:33:15.927 region:rollup2
Juvenile hall they're not the

00:33:14.292 --> 00:33:16.528 region:rollup2
proper place for the survivors

00:33:15.927 --> 00:33:19.965 region:rollup2
that they're victims of crime

00:33:16.528 --> 00:33:22.067 region:rollup2
not criminals.

00:33:19.965 --> 00:33:22.667 region:rollup2
But urban foster. Group foster

00:33:22.067 --> 00:33:23.869 region:rollup2
homes or group homes are also

00:33:22.667 --> 00:33:25.871 region:rollup2
not.

00:33:23.869 --> 00:33:29.875 region:rollup2
The right place.

00:33:25.871 --> 00:33:32.010 region:rollup2
Those locations lack the the

00:33:29.875 --> 00:33:34.045 region:rollup2
structure and the. Staff who are

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:34.479 region:rollup2
trained in commercially sexually

00:33:34.045 --> 00:33:37.916 region:rollup2
exploited children.

00:33:34.479 --> 00:33:39.885 region:rollup2
And.

00:33:37.916 --> 00:33:43.855 region:rollup2
Better really necessary for the.

00:33:39.885 --> 00:33:45.891 region:rollup2
For the juvenile. Ad trafficking

00:33:43.855 --> 00:33:47.893 region:rollup2
survivors it to.

00:33:45.891 --> 00:33:49.928 region:rollup2
To thrive.

00:33:47.893 --> 00:33:50.562 region:rollup2
And it to heal from the

00:33:49.928 --> 00:33:50.829 region:rollup2
trafficking situation that they

00:33:50.562 --> 00:33:51.897 region:rollup2
were at.

00:33:50.829 --> 00:33:55.901 region:rollup2
At.

00:33:51.897 --> 00:33:57.903 region:rollup2
Example that we've experienced

00:33:55.901 --> 00:33:58.570 region:rollup2
my office related to that wise.

00:33:57.903 --> 00:34:01.940 region:rollup2
In a recent case where juvenile

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:03.909 region:rollup2
trafficking Sir at.

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:05.911 region:rollup2
You're the victim. Than survivor

00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:08.046 region:rollup2
ritualized located in central

00:34:05.911 --> 00:34:09.948 region:rollup2
California the trafficker was in

00:34:08.046 --> 00:34:10.482 region:rollup2
southern California.

00:34:09.948 --> 00:34:11.049 region:rollup2
That young woman traveled

00:34:10.482 --> 00:34:13.952 region:rollup2
several hundred miles on her

00:34:11.049 --> 00:34:15.954 region:rollup2
own.

00:34:13.952 --> 00:34:16.555 region:rollup2
Three times.

00:34:15.954 --> 00:34:18.290 region:rollup2
To be to re unite with her

00:34:16.555 --> 00:34:20.392 region:rollup2
trafficker despite having being

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:22.193 region:rollup2
rescued were covered by law

00:34:20.392 --> 00:34:23.929 region:rollup2
enforcement. And each of the

00:34:22.193 --> 00:34:26.164 region:rollup2
previous times.

00:34:23.929 --> 00:34:26.765 region:rollup2
It wasn't until she was placed

00:34:26.164 --> 00:34:27.933 region:rollup2
in this case that her parents

00:34:26.765 --> 00:34:30.302 region:rollup2
expense.

00:34:27.933 --> 00:34:30.535 region:rollup2
A camp in a rural town out of

00:34:30.302 --> 00:34:32.404 region:rollup2
state.

00:34:30.535 --> 00:34:34.072 region:rollup2
That she was able to break free

00:34:32.404 --> 00:34:34.673 region:rollup2
of the traffickers mental

00:34:34.072 --> 00:34:36.007 region:rollup2
control over her. You really

00:34:34.673 --> 00:34:38.009 region:rollup2
begin to heal.

00:34:36.007 --> 00:34:40.045 region:rollup2
And.

00:34:38.009 --> 00:34:40.679 region:rollup2
It begins to get back to the

00:34:40.045 --> 00:34:41.313 region:rollup2
place that she was before she

00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:45.984 region:rollup2
was initially contacted by the

00:34:41.313 --> 00:34:48.420 region:rollup2
proper.

00:34:45.984 --> 00:34:50.255 region:rollup2
And despite the research gaps

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:52.023 region:rollup2
that remain in the hard work

00:34:50.255 --> 00:34:52.657 region:rollup2
that that is certainly a lot to

00:34:52.023 --> 00:34:54.192 region:rollup2
do with the fight against human

00:34:52.657 --> 00:34:56.227 region:rollup2
trafficking is under way. And we

00:34:54.192 --> 00:34:57.996 region:rollup2
can't allow and won't allow

00:34:56.227 --> 00:34:59.965 region:rollup2
traffickers to continue to.

00:34:57.996 --> 00:35:02.167 region:rollup2
Target

00:34:59.965 --> 00:35:04.002 region:rollup2
very vulnerable that segments of

00:35:02.167 --> 00:35:06.204 region:rollup2
our population.

00:35:04.002 --> 00:35:08.373 region:rollup2
Nor what will we are kind we

00:35:06.204 --> 00:35:10.041 region:rollup2
allowed the. Strong survivors of

00:35:08.373 --> 00:35:12.143 region:rollup2
this crime to be left behind.

00:35:10.041 --> 00:35:12.811 region:rollup2
The Attorney General is the

00:35:12.143 --> 00:35:14.045 region:rollup2
chief law enforcement officer of

00:35:12.811 --> 00:35:16.081 region:rollup2
the state.

00:35:14.045 --> 00:35:16.514 region:rollup2
Is committed to continuing the

00:35:16.081 --> 00:35:18.049 region:rollup2
strong work I've his

00:35:16.514 --> 00:35:18.650 region:rollup2
predecessor.

00:35:18.049 --> 00:35:20.018 region:rollup2
And remaining a leader in the

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:22.320 region:rollup2
fight.

00:35:20.018 --> 00:35:24.022 region:rollup2
And we look forward to continue

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:25.991 region:rollup2
discussions.

00:35:24.022 --> 00:35:26.591 region:rollup2
In partnership with legislature

00:35:25.991 --> 00:35:28.426 region:rollup2
to stop human trafficking and

00:35:26.591 --> 00:35:30.195 region:rollup2
provide victims of the critical

00:35:28.426 --> 00:35:32.030 region:rollup2
services they need to be

00:35:30.195 --> 00:35:34.032 region:rollup2
survivors.

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:36.234 region:rollup2
And it to thrive.

00:35:34.032 --> 00:35:38.003 region:rollup2
And thank you again to chair and

questions.

This was not thank you for your

presentation and we will before

00:35:44.376 --> 00:35:48.079 region:rollup2
questions come. Which we do have

00:35:46.478 --> 00:35:48.780 region:rollup2
some.

00:35:48.079 --> 00:35:50.382 region:rollup2
Before they come we will turn

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:52.083 region:rollup2
to our final panelist to speak

00:35:50.382 --> 00:35:54.019 region:rollup2
and present.

00:35:52.083 --> 00:35:54.619 region:rollup2
Mister Aaron to fari for a

00:35:54.019 --> 00:35:56.488 region:rollup2
deputy district attorney for

00:35:54.619 --> 00:35:58.089 region:rollup2
cost cost accounting thank you

for being here.

00:35:58.089 --> 00:36:02.093 region:rollup2
First they determine very.

00:35:58.657 --> 00:36:02.727 region:rollup2
When the.

00:36:02.093 --> 00:36:04.095 region:rollup2
Thank you chairman Grayson for

00:36:02.727 --> 00:36:06.064 region:rollup2
putting this committee together.

00:36:04.095 --> 00:36:06.631 region:rollup2
I really do want to emphasize

00:36:06.064 --> 00:36:10.068 region:rollup2
what this return your mallee

00:36:06.631 --> 00:36:10.702 region:rollup2
already said which is but we

00:36:10.068 --> 00:36:12.404 region:rollup2
appreciate your ongoing efforts

00:36:10.702 --> 00:36:14.139 region:rollup2
here we want to make sure that

00:36:12.404 --> 00:36:16.174 region:rollup2
human trafficking is not. Just a

00:36:14.139 --> 00:36:16.775 region:rollup2
flavor of the month or flavor of

00:36:16.174 --> 00:36:18.343 region:rollup2
the year type of crime where

00:36:16.775 --> 00:36:20.011 region:rollup2
everybody learns about it and

00:36:18.343 --> 00:36:20.512 region:rollup2
then like district attorney

00:36:20.011 --> 00:36:22.380 region:rollup2
o'malley said we become

00:36:20.512 --> 00:36:24.182 region:rollup2
complacent. Because we've

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:26.317 region:rollup2
already heard about it so thank

00:36:24.182 --> 00:36:28.019 region:rollup2
you for continuing this fight we

00:36:26.317 --> 00:36:28.687 region:rollup2
really do appreciate it.

00:36:28.019 --> 00:36:32.090 region:rollup2
The next person I would think is

00:36:28.687 --> 00:36:32.757 region:rollup2
district attorney o'malley. It's

00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:34.159 region:rollup2
I think it goes without saying

00:36:32.757 --> 00:36:36.428 region:rollup2
but I'm gonna say it anyways she

00:36:34.159 --> 00:36:38.163 region:rollup2
has been the tip of the spear.

00:36:36.428 --> 00:36:40.198 region:rollup2
And her offices been the

00:36:38.163 --> 00:36:40.799 region:rollup2
flagship in fighting human

00:36:40.198 --> 00:36:42.467 region:rollup2
trafficking in California we

00:36:40.799 --> 00:36:44.369 region:rollup2
have modeled a number of efforts

00:36:42.467 --> 00:36:46.304 region:rollup2
that we've undertaken is

00:36:44.369 --> 00:36:48.373 region:rollup2
chairman grace and set. Off of

00:36:46.304 --> 00:36:50.175 region:rollup2
what she has done and we.

00:36:48.373 --> 00:36:52.243 region:rollup2
.

00:36:50.175 --> 00:36:52.877 region:rollup2
I feel a little bit out of place

00:36:52.243 --> 00:36:56.214 region:rollup2
sitting next to her on a panel

00:36:52.877 --> 00:36:58.216 region:rollup2
like this but I'll do my best.

00:36:56.214 --> 00:37:00.418 region:rollup2
What I want to talk about today?

00:36:58.216 --> 00:37:02.320 region:rollup2
And what I think is relevant for

00:37:00.418 --> 00:37:04.422 region:rollup2
the conversation you're starting

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:06.357 region:rollup2
here. Is there's two two issues

00:37:04.422 --> 00:37:06.791 region:rollup2
I want to talk about and one is

00:37:06.357 --> 00:37:08.426 region:rollup2
the need for multi

00:37:06.791 --> 00:37:10.195 region:rollup2
jurisdictional efforts in our

00:37:08.426 --> 00:37:12.263 region:rollup2
county.

00:37:10.195 --> 00:37:14.165 region:rollup2
To attack and prosecute human

00:37:12.263 --> 00:37:16.301 region:rollup2
trafficking operations

00:37:14.165 --> 00:37:18.169 region:rollup2
particularly large scale. Human

00:37:16.301 --> 00:37:18.803 region:rollup2
trafficking operations and the

00:37:18.169 --> 00:37:20.371 region:rollup2
next topic I wanted to address

00:37:18.803 --> 00:37:22.273 region:rollup2
after I talk about that is

00:37:20.371 --> 00:37:22.740 region:rollup2
what's already been touched on

00:37:22.273 --> 00:37:24.542 region:rollup2
by deal Nelly. And a

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:28.113 region:rollup2
representative from DOJ and that

00:37:24.542 --> 00:37:30.315 region:rollup2
is addressing how to meet

00:37:28.113 --> 00:37:32.117 region:rollup2
victims where they are and more

00:37:30.315 --> 00:37:34.185 region:rollup2
properly how to ensure that they

00:37:32.117 --> 00:37:36.154 region:rollup2
become survivors of human

00:37:34.185 --> 00:37:36.688 region:rollup2
trafficking. And just the

00:37:36.154 --> 00:37:38.623 region:rollup2
partnerships that we are

00:37:36.688 --> 00:37:40.625 region:rollup2
required to forge and make that

00:37:38.623 --> 00:37:42.594 region:rollup2
happen and it's it's not easy

00:37:40.625 --> 00:37:44.529 region:rollup2
especially the county as diverse

00:37:42.594 --> 00:37:46.297 region:rollup2
as ours with as many different

00:37:44.529 --> 00:37:48.266 region:rollup2
jurisdictions as we have. Our

00:37:46.297 --> 00:37:48.833 region:rollup2
county is a little different we

00:37:48.266 --> 00:37:50.602 region:rollup2
have all types of different

00:37:48.833 --> 00:37:52.504 region:rollup2
populations here and so it's not

00:37:50.602 --> 00:37:54.305 region:rollup2
always easy to coordinate those

00:37:52.504 --> 00:37:54.906 region:rollup2
efforts. But I'm proud to say

00:37:54.305 --> 00:37:56.274 region:rollup2
that I think we've made great

00:37:54.906 --> 00:37:58.343 region:rollup2
progress there.

00:37:56.274 --> 00:38:00.145 region:rollup2
So first in terms of multi

00:37:58.343 --> 00:38:02.147 region:rollup2
jurisdictional investigations

00:38:00.145 --> 00:38:02.747 region:rollup2
what we've discovered but what

00:38:02.147 --> 00:38:03.214 region:rollup2
we have not yet perfected and

00:38:02.747 --> 00:38:04.549 region:rollup2
we're working hard to

00:38:03.214 --> 00:38:08.219 region:rollup2
accomplish.

00:38:04.549 --> 00:38:10.255 region:rollup2
Is developing a task force

00:38:08.219 --> 00:38:12.290 region:rollup2
approach to trafficking.

00:38:10.255 --> 00:38:16.327 region:rollup2
Investigations specifically we

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:16.928 region:rollup2
have a really frankly FBI safe

00:38:16.327 --> 00:38:18.596 region:rollup2
streets task force here in

00:38:16.928 --> 00:38:22.233 region:rollup2
Contra Costa county they partner

00:38:18.596 --> 00:38:24.235 region:rollup2
with us and our agencies and

00:38:22.233 --> 00:38:24.803 region:rollup2
specifically the DA's office. To

00:38:24.235 --> 00:38:28.239 region:rollup2
attack large scale criminal

00:38:24.803 --> 00:38:28.840 region:rollup2
enterprise and problematic.

00:38:28.239 --> 00:38:32.210 region:rollup2
Particularly criminal street

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:32.844 region:rollup2
gang violence issues and as part

00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:34.512 region:rollup2
of that we have accomplished

00:38:32.844 --> 00:38:36.214 region:rollup2
several large scale human

00:38:34.512 --> 00:38:38.616 region:rollup2
trafficking investigations

00:38:36.214 --> 00:38:40.518 region:rollup2
through for example wire taps. A

00:38:38.616 --> 00:38:44.255 region:rollup2
one of the. Investigations we

00:38:40.518 --> 00:38:46.191 region:rollup2
managed to accomplish that was

00:38:44.255 --> 00:38:46.858 region:rollup2
particularly surprising was a

00:38:46.191 --> 00:38:50.195 region:rollup2
human trafficking operation that

00:38:46.858 --> 00:38:52.397 region:rollup2
had been running out of Danville

00:38:50.195 --> 00:38:54.499 region:rollup2
for approximately fifteen years

00:38:52.397 --> 00:38:56.234 region:rollup2
and also parts of Alameda county

00:38:54.499 --> 00:38:56.534 region:rollup2
Livermore.

00:38:56.234 --> 00:38:58.503 region:rollup2
In Dublin.

00:38:56.534 --> 00:39:00.471 region:rollup2
And it was one individual named

00:38:58.503 --> 00:39:04.242 region:rollup2
James Joseph junior who had been

00:39:00.471 --> 00:39:06.244 region:rollup2
running women adult women across

00:39:04.242 --> 00:39:06.845 region:rollup2
the country. For fifteen years

00:39:06.244 --> 00:39:08.613 region:rollup2
starting at approximately two

00:39:06.845 --> 00:39:10.648 region:rollup2
thousand or two thousand one

00:39:08.613 --> 00:39:12.650 region:rollup2
Mister Joseph had trafficked

00:39:10.648 --> 00:39:16.254 region:rollup2
victims all across the country.

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:16.854 region:rollup2
And his method was he would lie.

00:39:16.254 --> 00:39:18.756 region:rollup2
To the women you would me he

00:39:16.854 --> 00:39:20.525 region:rollup2
pick on eighteen nineteen twenty

00:39:18.756 --> 00:39:22.527 region:rollup2
year old women he tell them they

00:39:20.525 --> 00:39:24.462 region:rollup2
were beautiful. And that they

00:39:22.527 --> 00:39:26.297 region:rollup2
would be models or maybe make up

00:39:24.462 --> 00:39:26.898 region:rollup2
artists and we travel across the

00:39:26.297 --> 00:39:28.366 region:rollup2
country and make hundreds of

00:39:26.898 --> 00:39:30.501 region:rollup2
thousands of dollars. Mister

00:39:28.366 --> 00:39:34.272 region:rollup2
Joseph was a very good con man.

00:39:30.501 --> 00:39:36.307 region:rollup2
He dressed the part he had their

00:39:34.272 --> 00:39:38.376 region:rollup2
expensive cars he had rented a

00:39:36.307 --> 00:39:40.478 region:rollup2
number of very nice houses from

00:39:38.376 --> 00:39:42.280 region:rollup2
San Ramon to Danville which is.

00:39:40.478 --> 00:39:42.847 region:rollup2
One of our more affluent

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.749 region:rollup2
communities in Qatar Costa

00:39:42.847 --> 00:39:46.651 region:rollup2
county. And he would learn these

00:39:44.749 --> 00:39:48.653 region:rollup2
women in and after two or three

00:39:46.651 --> 00:39:50.555 region:rollup2
meetings and he would bring his

00:39:48.653 --> 00:39:52.257 region:rollup2
other girls the other survivors

00:39:50.555 --> 00:39:52.890 region:rollup2
the other trafficking victims

00:39:52.257 --> 00:39:54.659 region:rollup2
with him. And they would play

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:56.494 region:rollup2
the part of success model.

00:39:54.659 --> 00:39:58.329 region:rollup2
He would bring them in and after

00:39:56.494 --> 00:40:00.431 region:rollup2
two or three appointments he

00:39:58.329 --> 00:40:02.300 region:rollup2
would get the next victim alone.

00:40:00.431 --> 00:40:02.867 region:rollup2
Raper

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:04.502 region:rollup2
tell her he had all of his

00:40:02.867 --> 00:40:06.504 region:rollup2
information all of her

00:40:04.502 --> 00:40:07.171 region:rollup2
information rather. And then he

00:40:06.504 --> 00:40:08.573 region:rollup2
would say you're going to be in

00:40:07.171 --> 00:40:10.375 region:rollup2
the trafficking ring or I'm

00:40:08.573 --> 00:40:12.510 region:rollup2
going to kill your family.

00:40:10.375 --> 00:40:14.379 region:rollup2
A Mister Joseph it pull that off

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:16.581 region:rollup2
for fifteen years.

00:40:14.379 --> 00:40:18.616 region:rollup2
Fifteen years he had been

00:40:16.581 --> 00:40:19.183 region:rollup2
arrested by the federal

00:40:18.616 --> 00:40:20.351 region:rollup2
government on more than one

00:40:19.183 --> 00:40:22.587 region:rollup2
occasion.

00:40:20.351 --> 00:40:26.324 region:rollup2
Is trafficking activities had

00:40:22.587 --> 00:40:26.891 region:rollup2
been detected in New York. Ohio

00:40:26.324 --> 00:40:28.359 region:rollup2
places like that but at the

00:40:26.891 --> 00:40:28.860 region:rollup2
time.

00:40:28.359 --> 00:40:30.361 region:rollup2
We didn't recognize as a

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:30.895 region:rollup2
society.

00:40:30.361 --> 00:40:34.365 region:rollup2
Or is the law enforcement

00:40:30.895 --> 00:40:35.033 region:rollup2
community.

00:40:34.365 --> 00:40:36.768 region:rollup2
What human trafficking look like

00:40:35.033 --> 00:40:38.436 region:rollup2
and so when he was arrested for

00:40:36.768 --> 00:40:40.538 region:rollup2
these crimes it wasn't fully

00:40:38.436 --> 00:40:42.373 region:rollup2
appreciated the scope of what

00:40:40.538 --> 00:40:42.974 region:rollup2
he'd been perpetrating so we

00:40:42.373 --> 00:40:43.207 region:rollup2
just a short stints in federal

00:40:42.974 --> 00:40:44.409 region:rollup2
prison?

00:40:43.207 --> 00:40:46.744 region:rollup2
But he kept at it.

00:40:44.409 --> 00:40:48.780 region:rollup2
Finally in two thousand and

00:40:46.744 --> 00:40:50.882 region:rollup2
fifteen through some incredibly

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:52.650 region:rollup2
alert work by members of the San

00:40:50.882 --> 00:40:56.354 region:rollup2
Ramon police department. They

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:56.988 region:rollup2
listened to one of his survivors

00:40:56.354 --> 00:40:58.756 region:rollup2
one of Mister Joseph survivors

00:40:56.988 --> 00:41:00.558 region:rollup2
speak at a human trafficking

00:40:58.756 --> 00:41:02.360 region:rollup2
awareness conference. He brought

00:41:00.558 --> 00:41:04.429 region:rollup2
the case to San Ramon police

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:06.364 region:rollup2
department. They did a lot of

00:41:04.429 --> 00:41:06.664 region:rollup2
surveillance work and our human

00:41:06.364 --> 00:41:08.399 region:rollup2
trafficking.

00:41:06.664 --> 00:41:09.033 region:rollup2
.

00:41:08.399 --> 00:41:10.535 region:rollup2
Deputy will we have one human

00:41:09.033 --> 00:41:12.470 region:rollup2
trafficking jeopardy in Contra

00:41:10.535 --> 00:41:13.037 region:rollup2
Costa county now and we're

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:14.906 region:rollup2
working to increase that.

00:41:13.037 --> 00:41:16.874 region:rollup2
But they brought it to our

00:41:14.906 --> 00:41:18.376 region:rollup2
office we got together with the

00:41:16.874 --> 00:41:18.810 region:rollup2
safe streets task force and

00:41:18.376 --> 00:41:20.678 region:rollup2
initiated a wiretap

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:22.780 region:rollup2
investigation. And what that

00:41:20.678 --> 00:41:24.882 region:rollup2
wiretap investigation turned

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:26.617 region:rollup2
over was just what I said Mister

00:41:24.882 --> 00:41:30.388 region:rollup2
Joseph it conducted a nationwide

00:41:26.617 --> 00:41:31.022 region:rollup2
human trafficking ring. For sex

00:41:30.388 --> 00:41:32.790 region:rollup2
for the better part of fifteen

00:41:31.022 --> 00:41:34.425 region:rollup2
years. We brought a forensic

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:36.661 region:rollup2
accountant in an eBay roughly.

00:41:34.425 --> 00:41:38.629 region:rollup2
One point five to two million

00:41:36.661 --> 00:41:40.365 region:rollup2
dollars per year running the

00:41:38.629 --> 00:41:40.798 region:rollup2
human trafficking ring.

00:41:40.365 --> 00:41:41.299 region:rollup2
Through the wiretap

00:41:40.798 --> 00:41:42.834 region:rollup2
investigation and some

00:41:41.299 --> 00:41:46.504 region:rollup2
phenomenal work thanks in large

00:41:42.834 --> 00:41:47.071 region:rollup2
part to. Our partners who

00:41:46.504 --> 00:41:48.606 region:rollup2
sponsor a victim witness

00:41:47.071 --> 00:41:50.475 region:rollup2
advocacy program at the

00:41:48.606 --> 00:41:52.543 region:rollup2
California department of justice

00:41:50.475 --> 00:41:53.177 region:rollup2
and the state. We were able to

00:41:52.543 --> 00:41:54.879 region:rollup2
develop a number of victims.

00:41:53.177 --> 00:41:58.549 region:rollup2
Put Mister Joseph and his

00:41:54.879 --> 00:42:00.518 region:rollup2
partner his common law wife on

00:41:58.549 --> 00:42:02.453 region:rollup2
trial for human trafficking and

00:42:00.518 --> 00:42:02.954 region:rollup2
multiple counts of rape. That

00:42:02.453 --> 00:42:04.722 region:rollup2
investigation came to a

00:42:02.954 --> 00:42:06.657 region:rollup2
successful close actually less

00:42:04.722 --> 00:42:08.493 region:rollup2
than three or four months ago

00:42:06.657 --> 00:42:09.127 region:rollup2
and Mister Joseph.

00:42:08.493 --> 00:42:10.762 region:rollup2
Was sentenced last week to a

00:42:09.127 --> 00:42:12.697 region:rollup2
hundred and seventy four years

00:42:10.762 --> 00:42:14.432 region:rollup2
to life in the state

00:42:12.697 --> 00:42:16.434 region:rollup2
penitentiary. Which is

00:42:14.432 --> 00:42:18.436 region:rollup2
absolutely the right result but

00:42:16.434 --> 00:42:20.505 region:rollup2
it was a lot of work and it was

00:42:18.436 --> 00:42:21.039 region:rollup2
only made possible by the

00:42:20.505 --> 00:42:22.707 region:rollup2
cooperation of multiple

00:42:21.039 --> 00:42:24.442 region:rollup2
jurisdictions and the FBI safe

00:42:22.707 --> 00:42:26.444 region:rollup2
streets task force.

00:42:24.442 --> 00:42:28.546 region:rollup2
We need to expand that.

00:42:26.444 --> 00:42:30.415 region:rollup2
What DA o'malley is done in her

00:42:28.546 --> 00:42:30.948 region:rollup2
jurisdiction by creating he task

00:42:30.415 --> 00:42:32.450 region:rollup2
force is a great model to

00:42:30.948 --> 00:42:34.819 region:rollup2
follow?

00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:38.389 region:rollup2
It obviously each county each

00:42:34.819 --> 00:42:39.057 region:rollup2
city is unique and Carter Costa

00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:42.493 region:rollup2
needs to have its own solution

00:42:39.057 --> 00:42:43.227 region:rollup2
but one that looks a lot like

00:42:42.493 --> 00:42:44.862 region:rollup2
what DO now is done. The head of

00:42:43.227 --> 00:42:46.864 region:rollup2
our sexual so unit right now

00:42:44.862 --> 00:42:48.566 region:rollup2
senior deputy district attorney

00:42:46.864 --> 00:42:50.835 region:rollup2
Paul graves is working hard. To

00:42:48.566 --> 00:42:54.472 region:rollup2
create a human trafficking task

00:42:50.835 --> 00:42:56.441 region:rollup2
force a one day is not being.

00:42:54.472 --> 00:42:57.008 region:rollup2
Somewhat multi task if you will

00:42:56.441 --> 00:42:58.776 region:rollup2
with combating gang violence

00:42:57.008 --> 00:42:59.343 region:rollup2
because that's incredibly

00:42:58.776 --> 00:43:00.778 region:rollup2
important and they've made

00:42:59.343 --> 00:43:01.312 region:rollup2
tremendous strides especially

00:43:00.778 --> 00:43:04.449 region:rollup2
with the freeway shooting

00:43:01.312 --> 00:43:06.451 region:rollup2
epidemic we had here. But also

00:43:04.449 --> 00:43:07.084 region:rollup2
focuses on human trafficking

00:43:06.451 --> 00:43:08.820 region:rollup2
because that deserves its own

00:43:07.084 --> 00:43:10.922 region:rollup2
taskforce and that deserves its

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:12.490 region:rollup2
own resources. So we're working

00:43:10.922 --> 00:43:14.592 region:rollup2
to create that.

00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:15.193 region:rollup2
We need more support we need

00:43:14.592 --> 00:43:16.861 region:rollup2
more help our law enforcement

00:43:15.193 --> 00:43:18.663 region:rollup2
agencies have been tremendously

00:43:16.861 --> 00:43:22.500 region:rollup2
supportive of that and we hope

00:43:18.663 --> 00:43:24.569 region:rollup2
they'll continue to do that.

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:25.203 region:rollup2
The next topic I want to talk

00:43:24.569 --> 00:43:28.639 region:rollup2
about is streamlining victim

00:43:25.203 --> 00:43:29.240 region:rollup2
services which which is a large

00:43:28.639 --> 00:43:30.541 region:rollup2
part of why we're here today.

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:32.543 region:rollup2
And.

00:43:30.541 --> 00:43:34.812 region:rollup2
Again I want to commend.

00:43:32.543 --> 00:43:36.647 region:rollup2
German Grayson and a number of

00:43:34.812 --> 00:43:37.315 region:rollup2
the elected officials in our

00:43:36.647 --> 00:43:40.551 region:rollup2
county who have worked to bring

00:43:37.315 --> 00:43:42.520 region:rollup2
us to family justice centers. We

00:43:40.551 --> 00:43:43.154 region:rollup2
have Susan came here today who.

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:44.922 region:rollup2
Has done a ton of work in that

00:43:43.154 --> 00:43:46.924 region:rollup2
area and we we couldn't be

00:43:44.922 --> 00:43:50.495 region:rollup2
happier with what we've achieved

00:43:46.924 --> 00:43:51.095 region:rollup2
and again. This is more of a

00:43:50.495 --> 00:43:52.730 region:rollup2
approach where we've learned a

00:43:51.095 --> 00:43:54.699 region:rollup2
lot by watching what Alameda

00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:55.266 region:rollup2
county is done. And we've

00:43:54.699 --> 00:43:56.834 region:rollup2
created two family justice

00:43:55.266 --> 00:43:58.803 region:rollup2
centers and the I think the

00:43:56.834 --> 00:43:59.403 region:rollup2
strength of that is we've

00:43:58.803 --> 00:44:00.905 region:rollup2
created a type of one stop

00:43:59.403 --> 00:44:04.575 region:rollup2
shopping if you will. For

00:44:00.905 --> 00:44:06.544 region:rollup2
victims of family violence.

00:44:04.575 --> 00:44:07.178 region:rollup2
Victims of sexual assault and

00:44:06.544 --> 00:44:08.579 region:rollup2
particularly victim of victims

00:44:07.178 --> 00:44:10.915 region:rollup2
of human trafficking.

00:44:08.579 --> 00:44:12.583 region:rollup2
Those are great strides forward

00:44:10.915 --> 00:44:16.521 region:rollup2
but we can still do more.

00:44:12.583 --> 00:44:17.121 region:rollup2
What we've seen and we started

00:44:16.521 --> 00:44:18.723 region:rollup2
to dress your day and I think

00:44:17.121 --> 00:44:20.725 region:rollup2
it's really important is that we

00:44:18.723 --> 00:44:22.660 region:rollup2
don't have enough beds just just

00:44:20.725 --> 00:44:24.795 region:rollup2
plain and simple? Our

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:26.764 region:rollup2
infrastructure in terms of how

00:44:24.795 --> 00:44:28.566 region:rollup2
we how is vulnerable victims or

00:44:26.764 --> 00:44:30.601 region:rollup2
survivors of human trafficking

00:44:28.566 --> 00:44:32.637 region:rollup2
is completely lacking.

00:44:30.601 --> 00:44:34.605 region:rollup2
We don't have safe places for

00:44:32.637 --> 00:44:35.139 region:rollup2
them to go and there's tension

00:44:34.605 --> 00:44:36.974 region:rollup2
especially for our. Minor

00:44:35.139 --> 00:44:38.743 region:rollup2
victims of human trafficking

00:44:36.974 --> 00:44:39.310 region:rollup2
there's a lot of tension between

00:44:38.743 --> 00:44:42.613 region:rollup2
what was already identified

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:43.247 region:rollup2
where do you put a minor victim

00:44:42.613 --> 00:44:44.982 region:rollup2
of human trafficking because we

00:44:43.247 --> 00:44:46.951 region:rollup2
know that. Group homes foster

00:44:44.982 --> 00:44:48.753 region:rollup2
homes those can be places where

00:44:46.951 --> 00:44:50.588 region:rollup2
they're re victimized or their

00:44:48.753 --> 00:44:52.690 region:rollup2
re recruited back into

00:44:50.588 --> 00:44:53.257 region:rollup2
trafficking rings. So we need

00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:54.959 region:rollup2
places that are completely

00:44:53.257 --> 00:44:56.928 region:rollup2
focused on human trafficking we

00:44:54.959 --> 00:44:58.930 region:rollup2
need more bed space is available

00:44:56.928 --> 00:44:59.530 region:rollup2
and we need to have those

00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:00.932 region:rollup2
accessible through our family

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:02.767 region:rollup2
justice centers. And those

00:45:00.932 --> 00:45:04.769 region:rollup2
places do have to be task

00:45:02.767 --> 00:45:06.871 region:rollup2
specific meaning for human

00:45:04.769 --> 00:45:08.639 region:rollup2
trafficking victims they need to

00:45:06.871 --> 00:45:10.675 region:rollup2
address some of our most common

00:45:08.639 --> 00:45:11.342 region:rollup2
ailments are most common.

00:45:10.675 --> 00:45:13.010 region:rollup2
Syndromes that affect our human

00:45:11.342 --> 00:45:14.612 region:rollup2
trafficking victims such as post

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:16.914 region:rollup2
traumatic stress disorder and

00:45:14.612 --> 00:45:18.783 region:rollup2
substance abuse because many of

00:45:16.914 --> 00:45:20.751 region:rollup2
our traffickers. Many of our

00:45:18.783 --> 00:45:22.787 region:rollup2
traffickers use drugs such as

00:45:20.751 --> 00:45:24.956 region:rollup2
methamphetamine heroin cocaine a

00:45:22.787 --> 00:45:26.824 region:rollup2
number of the prescription drugs

00:45:24.956 --> 00:45:28.759 region:rollup2
that are abused today to get. A

00:45:26.824 --> 00:45:30.661 region:rollup2
young women addicted so they can

00:45:28.759 --> 00:45:32.597 region:rollup2
keep them in their employ it's.

00:45:30.661 --> 00:45:34.532 region:rollup2
Manipulation method are

00:45:32.597 --> 00:45:36.667 region:rollup2
traffickers use so we absolutely

00:45:34.532 --> 00:45:40.771 region:rollup2
need to have trafficking spaces

00:45:36.667 --> 00:45:42.607 region:rollup2
trafficking beds available where

00:45:40.771 --> 00:45:43.040 region:rollup2
those types of.

00:45:42.607 --> 00:45:44.709 region:rollup2
Shoes are dressed.

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:45.343 region:rollup2
And.

00:45:44.709 --> 00:45:47.078 region:rollup2
I think one other part of that

00:45:45.343 --> 00:45:48.679 region:rollup2
and and it's already been

00:45:47.078 --> 00:45:50.748 region:rollup2
discussed today. But I do think

00:45:48.679 --> 00:45:52.683 region:rollup2
coupling or. Multiplying or

00:45:50.748 --> 00:45:53.184 region:rollup2
increasing our efforts with

00:45:52.683 --> 00:45:54.952 region:rollup2
partner partnering with

00:45:53.184 --> 00:45:56.721 region:rollup2
nonprofit organizations non

00:45:54.952 --> 00:45:58.723 region:rollup2
governmental organizations is

00:45:56.721 --> 00:45:59.390 region:rollup2
something we still need to work

00:45:58.723 --> 00:46:01.025 region:rollup2
on this county we are. Getting

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:02.960 region:rollup2
there but we're not there there

00:46:01.025 --> 00:46:05.062 region:rollup2
are brilliant organizations a

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:06.864 region:rollup2
Catholic Church is definitely

00:46:05.062 --> 00:46:08.599 region:rollup2
stepped up in a lot of ways but

00:46:06.864 --> 00:46:10.601 region:rollup2
we have other non religious

00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:11.235 region:rollup2
affiliated organizations like

00:46:10.601 --> 00:46:13.070 region:rollup2
pillars of pillars of hope is

00:46:11.235 --> 00:46:15.039 region:rollup2
religiously affiliated but. Arm

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:16.874 region:rollup2
of care which is a great

00:46:15.039 --> 00:46:17.475 region:rollup2
organization does a lot of work

00:46:16.874 --> 00:46:20.778 region:rollup2
with human trafficking victims

00:46:17.475 --> 00:46:22.813 region:rollup2
specifically trafficking victims

00:46:20.778 --> 00:46:26.617 region:rollup2
we need to. Continue to build

00:46:22.813 --> 00:46:27.118 region:rollup2
our relationships with those

00:46:26.617 --> 00:46:30.655 region:rollup2
types of organizations.

00:46:27.118 --> 00:46:32.657 region:rollup2
I would.

00:46:30.655 --> 00:46:34.892 region:rollup2
Finally like to mention that.

00:46:32.657 --> 00:46:36.627 region:rollup2
There is one last field of human

00:46:34.892 --> 00:46:38.929 region:rollup2
trafficking they were still

00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:39.597 region:rollup2
building out into and you're

00:46:38.929 --> 00:46:40.998 region:rollup2
gonna hear later today I believe

00:46:39.597 --> 00:46:43.000 region:rollup2
from Louise Reeves who works for

00:46:40.998 --> 00:46:44.935 region:rollup2
Pittsburgh police department she

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.004 region:rollup2
is a. Resource that we could not

00:46:44.935 --> 00:46:48.973 region:rollup2
do without I've said before I'll

00:46:47.004 --> 00:46:49.407 region:rollup2
say it again I wish we had ten

00:46:48.973 --> 00:46:52.843 region:rollup2
Louise Reeves is but

00:46:49.407 --> 00:46:54.945 region:rollup2
intelligence analysis for human

00:46:52.843 --> 00:46:56.947 region:rollup2
trafficking. Is a monster part

00:46:54.945 --> 00:46:59.050 region:rollup2
of the equation to effectively

00:46:56.947 --> 00:47:00.951 region:rollup2
attack and prosecute you and

00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:02.820 region:rollup2
trafficking I would I guess I'd

00:47:00.951 --> 00:47:04.755 region:rollup2
add this back into my multi

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:06.657 region:rollup2
jurisdictional approach we need

00:47:04.755 --> 00:47:08.793 region:rollup2
to take a social. Networking

00:47:06.657 --> 00:47:10.728 region:rollup2
intelligence analysis to how we

00:47:08.793 --> 00:47:12.797 region:rollup2
attack human trafficking and for

00:47:10.728 --> 00:47:14.699 region:rollup2
example in San Francisco a lot

00:47:12.797 --> 00:47:15.199 region:rollup2
of the way that they deal with

00:47:14.699 --> 00:47:17.034 region:rollup2
gang violence and they

00:47:15.199 --> 00:47:18.936 region:rollup2
investigate gang violence. That

00:47:17.034 --> 00:47:20.971 region:rollup2
takes place when they look at

00:47:18.936 --> 00:47:22.973 region:rollup2
network analysis they look at

00:47:20.971 --> 00:47:25.009 region:rollup2
who contacts to who knows who

00:47:22.973 --> 00:47:27.078 region:rollup2
and they build out complicated

00:47:25.009 --> 00:47:30.848 region:rollup2
nexus maps to determine where

00:47:27.078 --> 00:47:32.783 region:rollup2
violence will occur next it's

00:47:30.848 --> 00:47:35.086 region:rollup2
pretty sophisticated model.

00:47:32.783 --> 00:47:36.721 region:rollup2
Louise Reeves at Pittsburgh Pete

00:47:35.086 --> 00:47:38.989 region:rollup2
is taking an intelligence

00:47:36.721 --> 00:47:41.192 region:rollup2
analysis approach to determining

00:47:38.989 --> 00:47:43.027 region:rollup2
where and when human trafficking

00:47:41.192 --> 00:47:45.062 region:rollup2
is occurring we need to do that

00:47:43.027 --> 00:47:47.164 region:rollup2
on the next level. And I think

00:47:45.062 --> 00:47:50.801 region:rollup2
that that doesn't have to be

00:47:47.164 --> 00:47:52.970 region:rollup2
individualized departments are

00:47:50.801 --> 00:47:55.005 region:rollup2
in visual police departments I

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:57.074 region:rollup2
think would be an excellent

00:47:55.005 --> 00:47:58.809 region:rollup2
addition to human trafficking

00:47:57.074 --> 00:47:59.410 region:rollup2
task force.

00:47:58.809 --> 00:48:00.811 region:rollup2
So thank you gonna some women.

00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:02.780 region:rollup2
Should the time.

00:48:00.811 --> 00:48:03.347 region:rollup2
Thank you for your presentation

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:04.815 region:rollup2
deputy de eight of ari and.

00:48:03.347 --> 00:48:05.449 region:rollup2
.

00:48:04.815 --> 00:48:06.951 region:rollup2
Your presentations for all three

00:48:05.449 --> 00:48:07.585 region:rollup2
of you were fantastic. I I wrote

00:48:06.951 --> 00:48:09.253 region:rollup2
down a couple of quotes here.

00:48:07.585 --> 00:48:11.088 region:rollup2
Because it was said and I I

00:48:09.253 --> 00:48:11.756 region:rollup2
have just a a question I'm gonna

00:48:11.088 --> 00:48:12.990 region:rollup2
ask you that we're gonna get on

00:48:11.756 --> 00:48:13.557 region:rollup2
to the next panel. So I'm sure

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:15.226 region:rollup2
we will be able to exhausted

00:48:13.557 --> 00:48:16.894 region:rollup2
today about something for you to

00:48:15.226 --> 00:48:17.461 region:rollup2
think about and hopefully a

00:48:16.894 --> 00:48:19.330 region:rollup2
provide some feedback to my

00:48:17.461 --> 00:48:20.965 region:rollup2
office. Because I really do want

00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:21.399 region:rollup2
to provide some assistance to be

00:48:20.965 --> 00:48:23.334 region:rollup2
a resource to you.

00:48:21.399 --> 00:48:24.935 region:rollup2
Some statements were made that

00:48:23.334 --> 00:48:27.138 region:rollup2
that traffickers if not

00:48:24.935 --> 00:48:29.073 region:rollup2
prosecuted will continue to

00:48:27.138 --> 00:48:31.041 region:rollup2
traffic. And then the quote we

00:48:29.073 --> 00:48:32.877 region:rollup2
have to prosecute traffickers

00:48:31.041 --> 00:48:33.577 region:rollup2
and then.

00:48:32.877 --> 00:48:35.246 region:rollup2
It was made known by this place

00:48:33.577 --> 00:48:37.081 region:rollup2
for one of the four pieces

00:48:35.246 --> 00:48:39.383 region:rollup2
prosecute. And then.

00:48:37.081 --> 00:48:42.920 region:rollup2
A comment that was made quote

00:48:39.383 --> 00:48:43.554 region:rollup2
unquote we need more help. The

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:45.256 region:rollup2
question that I would have for

00:48:43.554 --> 00:48:48.826 region:rollup2
you is what barriers currently

00:48:45.256 --> 00:48:49.326 region:rollup2
exist that would limit or impede

00:48:48.826 --> 00:48:52.830 region:rollup2
your offices efforts to

00:48:49.326 --> 00:48:53.464 region:rollup2
prosecute human traffickers. And

00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:55.266 region:rollup2
part to that question is what

00:48:53.464 --> 00:48:57.101 region:rollup2
can lead just what can lead to

00:48:55.266 --> 00:48:59.069 region:rollup2
the legislature do to help law

00:48:57.101 --> 00:49:01.138 region:rollup2
enforcement combat human

00:48:59.069 --> 00:49:04.909 region:rollup2
trafficking and assist the

00:49:01.138 --> 00:49:05.109 region:rollup2
victims.

00:49:04.909 --> 00:49:07.278 region:rollup2
Well.

00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:08.913 region:rollup2
Part of the part of the

00:49:07.278 --> 00:49:10.915 region:rollup2
challenge is that.

00:49:08.913 --> 00:49:11.582 region:rollup2
That.

00:49:10.915 --> 00:49:13.150 region:rollup2
Those that have been trafficked

00:49:11.582 --> 00:49:14.919 region:rollup2
some don't trust the system

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:17.121 region:rollup2
because they've been trained and

00:49:14.919 --> 00:49:19.089 region:rollup2
taught not to. So they don't

00:49:17.121 --> 00:49:20.891 region:rollup2
necessarily see the police as

00:49:19.089 --> 00:49:22.860 region:rollup2
their protector.

00:49:20.891 --> 00:49:23.227 region:rollup2
But that's the first thing the

00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:25.496 region:rollup2
bonding that.

00:49:23.227 --> 00:49:27.331 region:rollup2
That miss builder talked about

00:49:25.496 --> 00:49:28.899 region:rollup2
is real and we need to make sure

00:49:27.331 --> 00:49:31.402 region:rollup2
that we are providing.

00:49:28.899 --> 00:49:31.969 region:rollup2
A lot of support to those that

00:49:31.402 --> 00:49:34.972 region:rollup2
are separated away from the

00:49:31.969 --> 00:49:37.041 region:rollup2
trafficker.

00:49:34.972 --> 00:49:38.976 region:rollup2
For them to be able to come into

00:49:37.041 --> 00:49:40.945 region:rollup2
court and testify.

00:49:38.976 --> 00:49:42.947 region:rollup2
I your legislature has passed

00:49:40.945 --> 00:49:43.481 region:rollup2
several of bills which I'm proud

00:49:42.947 --> 00:49:46.917 region:rollup2
of sponsored about. Having

00:49:43.481 --> 00:49:49.119 region:rollup2
closed circuit TV testimony and

00:49:46.917 --> 00:49:51.088 region:rollup2
doing are taking conditional

00:49:49.119 --> 00:49:53.190 region:rollup2
examination testimony early on

00:49:51.088 --> 00:49:55.326 region:rollup2
before the case actually. Hits

00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:56.961 region:rollup2
the the trial stage and I think

00:49:55.326 --> 00:50:00.965 region:rollup2
those are important tools.

00:49:56.961 --> 00:50:01.599 region:rollup2
But I do believe that.

00:50:00.965 --> 00:50:03.234 region:rollup2
That we need to in order to

00:50:01.599 --> 00:50:04.969 region:rollup2
successfully prosecute we need

00:50:03.234 --> 00:50:05.469 region:rollup2
to have witnesses.

00:50:04.969 --> 00:50:07.137 region:rollup2
And so how we're able to

00:50:05.469 --> 00:50:09.206 region:rollup2
support.

00:50:07.137 --> 00:50:11.208 region:rollup2
And provide the resources to

00:50:09.206 --> 00:50:13.010 region:rollup2
those victims and witnesses

00:50:11.208 --> 00:50:15.079 region:rollup2
early on.

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:17.248 region:rollup2
Is really critical to their

00:50:15.079 --> 00:50:19.016 region:rollup2
ability to stay with us and be

00:50:17.248 --> 00:50:24.989 region:rollup2
available to come and testify.

00:50:19.016 --> 00:50:25.589 region:rollup2
Excellent thank you.

00:50:24.989 --> 00:50:26.090 region:rollup2
One of the most significant.

00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:28.893 region:rollup2
Barriers continues to be

00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:30.895 region:rollup2
resources.

00:50:28.893 --> 00:50:31.562 region:rollup2
Other mentioned we have.

00:50:30.895 --> 00:50:33.464 region:rollup2
The department does that house

00:50:31.562 --> 00:50:35.332 region:rollup2
is a tough sport and see an ego

00:50:33.464 --> 00:50:35.599 region:rollup2
that has been quite successful

00:50:35.332 --> 00:50:37.234 region:rollup2
however.

00:50:35.599 --> 00:50:39.236 region:rollup2
At the department is only able

00:50:37.234 --> 00:50:41.138 region:rollup2
to see currently to staff that

00:50:39.236 --> 00:50:41.639 region:rollup2
have forced with three agents

00:50:41.138 --> 00:50:43.040 region:rollup2
including a supervisor.

00:50:41.639 --> 00:50:47.111 region:rollup2
And.

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:49.113 region:rollup2
So in short our court allocating

00:50:47.111 --> 00:50:50.948 region:rollup2
additional resources to this

00:50:49.113 --> 00:50:53.217 region:rollup2
collaborative regional.

00:50:50.948 --> 00:50:55.052 region:rollup2
Mold. Approach to human

00:50:53.217 --> 00:50:57.154 region:rollup2
trafficking that we've seen it

00:50:55.052 --> 00:50:59.023 region:rollup2
at be successful both at the

00:50:57.154 --> 00:51:00.991 region:rollup2
scene a good half fourth I know

00:50:59.023 --> 00:51:02.960 region:rollup2
in the in Alameda county. Is

00:51:00.991 --> 00:51:05.095 region:rollup2
well and.

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:05.663 region:rollup2
I I think would be something

00:51:05.095 --> 00:51:07.164 region:rollup2
certainly to address with

00:51:05.663 --> 00:51:09.033 region:rollup2
additional resources we would be

00:51:07.164 --> 00:51:11.135 region:rollup2
able to grow the existing task

00:51:09.033 --> 00:51:13.404 region:rollup2
force. I'm the DOJ houses and

00:51:11.135 --> 00:51:15.472 region:rollup2
ideally replicate that passport.

00:51:13.404 --> 00:51:16.974 region:rollup2
And central California northern

00:51:15.472 --> 00:51:19.076 region:rollup2
California

00:51:16.974 --> 00:51:21.011 region:rollup2
so that there is a greater reach

00:51:19.076 --> 00:51:23.047 region:rollup2
an ability to investigate.

00:51:21.011 --> 00:51:25.015 region:rollup2
More traffickers arrive to

00:51:23.047 --> 00:51:27.217 region:rollup2
prosecute war traffickers.

00:51:25.015 --> 00:51:29.186 region:rollup2
I think at second exactly what's

00:51:27.217 --> 00:51:31.388 region:rollup2
been said so far in in an. Ad

00:51:29.186 --> 00:51:33.357 region:rollup2
that in our office unfortunately

00:51:31.388 --> 00:51:35.159 region:rollup2
to date there's typically been

00:51:33.357 --> 00:51:37.127 region:rollup2
one for the last four years

00:51:35.159 --> 00:51:37.695 region:rollup2
assigned deputy district

00:51:37.127 --> 00:51:39.296 region:rollup2
attorney to prosecute human

00:51:37.695 --> 00:51:41.231 region:rollup2
trafficking. The truth is we

00:51:39.296 --> 00:51:43.267 region:rollup2
need more it these are very

00:51:41.231 --> 00:51:45.302 region:rollup2
complex cases they I often say

00:51:43.267 --> 00:51:47.271 region:rollup2
that they're sort of the

00:51:45.302 --> 00:51:49.239 region:rollup2
marriage in a bad way between

00:51:47.271 --> 00:51:51.208 region:rollup2
gang prosecution and domestic

00:51:49.239 --> 00:51:53.110 region:rollup2
violence prosecution because our

00:51:51.208 --> 00:51:55.012 region:rollup2
witnesses are unwilling. And

00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:55.646 region:rollup2
they're very mobile. Are

00:51:55.012 --> 00:51:57.381 region:rollup2
unfortunately are survivors are

00:51:55.646 --> 00:51:59.350 region:rollup2
very able to go from one place

00:51:57.381 --> 00:52:01.185 region:rollup2
to the next so the management of

00:51:59.350 --> 00:52:03.087 region:rollup2
the case takes a lot of time. I

00:52:01.185 --> 00:52:03.721 region:rollup2
will say that I am I am

00:52:03.087 --> 00:52:05.356 region:rollup2
appreciative of the efforts for

00:52:03.721 --> 00:52:07.358 region:rollup2
example assemblywoman Baker I

00:52:05.356 --> 00:52:09.193 region:rollup2
know sponsored legislation to

00:52:07.358 --> 00:52:10.995 region:rollup2
make all human trafficking

00:52:09.193 --> 00:52:11.495 region:rollup2
prosecutions vertically

00:52:10.995 --> 00:52:13.397 region:rollup2
prosecuted. Meeting one

00:52:11.495 --> 00:52:15.265 region:rollup2
prosecutor handled the case from

00:52:13.397 --> 00:52:17.001 region:rollup2
the filing to the end of the

00:52:15.265 --> 00:52:19.003 region:rollup2
case from cradle to grave if you

00:52:17.001 --> 00:52:21.238 region:rollup2
will. So I simply think we need

00:52:19.003 --> 00:52:23.273 region:rollup2
more resources and that. Goes

00:52:21.238 --> 00:52:23.807 region:rollup2
hand in hand with the bell being

00:52:23.273 --> 00:52:25.109 region:rollup2
our human trafficking task

00:52:23.807 --> 00:52:27.077 region:rollup2
force.

00:52:25.109 --> 00:52:29.246 region:rollup2
So obviously resources are

00:52:27.077 --> 00:52:31.115 region:rollup2
limited on every level we're all

00:52:29.246 --> 00:52:31.482 region:rollup2
feeling the crunch.

00:52:31.115 --> 00:52:33.384 region:rollup2
I know that.

00:52:31.482 --> 00:52:37.221 region:rollup2
If I if I am correct.

00:52:33.384 --> 00:52:37.421 region:rollup2
That to and this is a little

00:52:37.221 --> 00:52:39.423 region:rollup2
off.

00:52:37.421 --> 00:52:41.291 region:rollup2
Maybe topic but what will bring

00:52:39.423 --> 00:52:41.825 region:rollup2
it right back real quick because

00:52:41.291 --> 00:52:42.026 region:rollup2
we have to get to the next

00:52:41.825 --> 00:52:42.192 region:rollup2
panel.

00:52:42.026 --> 00:52:45.095 region:rollup2
But.

00:52:42.192 --> 00:52:49.066 region:rollup2
In in drug enforcement.

00:52:45.095 --> 00:52:49.566 region:rollup2
When there is an arrest. And

00:52:49.066 --> 00:52:53.103 region:rollup2
prosecution there are.

00:52:49.566 --> 00:52:55.305 region:rollup2
Seizures of assets.

00:52:53.103 --> 00:52:57.207 region:rollup2
Is that something that also

00:52:55.305 --> 00:52:57.574 region:rollup2
exist in the trafficking world

00:52:57.207 --> 00:53:01.111 region:rollup2
where you can.

00:52:57.574 --> 00:53:03.113 region:rollup2
Seize assets and use that to

00:53:01.111 --> 00:53:05.149 region:rollup2
actually help the healing side

00:53:03.113 --> 00:53:07.117 region:rollup2
or of victims.

00:53:05.149 --> 00:53:11.121 region:rollup2
Yes so am.

00:53:07.117 --> 00:53:13.257 region:rollup2
In the loop like two thousand.

00:53:11.121 --> 00:53:15.159 region:rollup2
Eleven twelve thirteen. We will

00:53:13.257 --> 00:53:17.094 region:rollup2
eat the legislature was able to

00:53:15.159 --> 00:53:17.628 region:rollup2
enact legislation that added

00:53:17.094 --> 00:53:19.430 region:rollup2
human trafficking to the

00:53:17.628 --> 00:53:21.432 region:rollup2
forfeiture statute. The place

00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:23.333 region:rollup2
where we see resources that are

00:53:21.432 --> 00:53:25.402 region:rollup2
identifiable is in labor

00:53:23.333 --> 00:53:27.438 region:rollup2
trafficking. And we've been very

00:53:25.402 --> 00:53:29.339 region:rollup2
successful at seizing. Buildings

00:53:27.438 --> 00:53:31.141 region:rollup2
and businesses and then being

00:53:29.339 --> 00:53:33.277 region:rollup2
able to provide research

00:53:31.141 --> 00:53:35.479 region:rollup2
restitution to the victims or to

00:53:33.277 --> 00:53:37.347 region:rollup2
pay for their. For their finding

00:53:35.479 --> 00:53:39.383 region:rollup2
the victims of crime fund which

00:53:37.347 --> 00:53:39.817 region:rollup2
is something that people don't

00:53:39.383 --> 00:53:41.685 region:rollup2
always think about.

00:53:39.817 --> 00:53:43.587 region:rollup2
That all prosecutor office in

00:53:41.685 --> 00:53:45.456 region:rollup2
the Attorney General get funds

00:53:43.587 --> 00:53:49.259 region:rollup2
for. And that is to.

00:53:45.456 --> 00:53:49.760 region:rollup2
Provide counselling for victims

00:53:49.259 --> 00:53:51.462 region:rollup2
and it does provide for

00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:53.163 region:rollup2
relocation if there's no safe

00:53:51.462 --> 00:53:53.831 region:rollup2
place.

00:53:53.163 --> 00:53:55.065 region:rollup2
And so that those are resources

00:53:53.831 --> 00:53:57.167 region:rollup2
that are there.

00:53:55.065 --> 00:53:59.169 region:rollup2
To help.

00:53:57.167 --> 00:53:59.336 region:rollup2
Augment.

00:53:59.169 --> 00:54:01.371 region:rollup2
The.

00:53:59.336 --> 00:54:03.140 region:rollup2
The forfeiture but in the sex

00:54:01.371 --> 00:54:05.442 region:rollup2
trafficking it's.

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:07.411 region:rollup2
Again it's a fluid for most of

00:54:05.442 --> 00:54:09.446 region:rollup2
what we see are lower level

00:54:07.411 --> 00:54:11.248 region:rollup2
traffickers. Are the big cases

00:54:09.446 --> 00:54:13.250 region:rollup2
like the case in Danville.

00:54:11.248 --> 00:54:15.285 region:rollup2
That case.

00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:17.354 region:rollup2
I would expect that under most

00:54:15.285 --> 00:54:19.256 region:rollup2
circumstances seizing the house

00:54:17.354 --> 00:54:21.358 region:rollup2
and selling the house is

00:54:19.256 --> 00:54:23.427 region:rollup2
completely within the realm of.

00:54:21.358 --> 00:54:25.562 region:rollup2
The law enforcement authority or

00:54:23.427 --> 00:54:27.331 region:rollup2
the prosecutors authority with

00:54:25.562 --> 00:54:29.133 region:rollup2
course with the court. I and

00:54:27.331 --> 00:54:31.235 region:rollup2
that.

00:54:29.133 --> 00:54:33.337 region:rollup2
Read those resources can become.

00:54:31.235 --> 00:54:35.172 region:rollup2
Restitution or they can also go

00:54:33.337 --> 00:54:37.407 region:rollup2
back into.

00:54:35.172 --> 00:54:39.176 region:rollup2
Of being able to support that

00:54:37.407 --> 00:54:41.145 region:rollup2
counties.

00:54:39.176 --> 00:54:43.147 region:rollup2
Efforts to continue the work

00:54:41.145 --> 00:54:43.680 region:rollup2
excellent thank you very much

00:54:43.147 --> 00:54:45.282 region:rollup2
and thank you to all the

appreciate your presentation.

00:54:47.151 --> 00:54:51.155 region:rollup2
They're worthy of a good hand

00:54:49.119 --> 00:54:53.524 region:rollup2
from us audio so we have.

00:54:51.155 --> 00:54:55.225 region:rollup2
We will now transition to our

next panel and.

00:54:55.225 --> 00:54:59.163 region:rollup2
We will be able to hear from

00:54:57.461 --> 00:54:59.663 region:rollup2
law enforcement and.

00:54:59.163 --> 00:55:01.265 region:rollup2
Their response to human

00:54:59.663 --> 00:55:01.465 region:rollup2
trafficking.

00:55:01.265 --> 00:55:03.333 region:rollup2
And.

00:55:01.465 --> 00:55:03.967 region:rollup2

this is just as great I'm so

00:56:33.257 --> 00:56:35.659 region:rollup2
excited that call to Costa

county is really recognizing the

00:56:35.659 --> 00:56:39.296 region:rollup2
problems that we have out here.

00:56:37.294 --> 00:56:39.863 region:rollup2
I am.

00:56:39.296 --> 00:56:41.632 region:rollup2
What is a community service

00:56:39.863 --> 00:56:42.199 region:rollup2
specials the pits but please

00:56:41.632 --> 00:56:43.300 region:rollup2
department I'm not a police

00:56:42.199 --> 00:56:45.669 region:rollup2
officer?

00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:47.271 region:rollup2
I have for the last ten years

00:56:45.669 --> 00:56:49.506 region:rollup2
been investigating my weight

00:56:47.271 --> 00:56:51.475 region:rollup2
juveniles. And over the lost.

00:56:49.506 --> 00:56:53.310 region:rollup2
Basically since two thousand

00:56:51.475 --> 00:56:55.445 region:rollup2
eleven when I had my first

00:56:53.310 --> 00:56:57.314 region:rollup2
trafficking case. I really

00:56:55.445 --> 00:56:57.914 region:rollup2
recognize that this is a giant

00:56:57.314 --> 00:56:59.616 region:rollup2
problem that we have here in

00:56:57.914 --> 00:57:01.718 region:rollup2
Contra Costa county. My first

00:56:59.616 --> 00:57:03.587 region:rollup2
case was a girl she was fourteen

00:57:01.718 --> 00:57:05.322 region:rollup2
years old she was picked up on

00:57:03.587 --> 00:57:07.457 region:rollup2
railroad Avenue in Pittsburgh.

00:57:05.322 --> 00:57:09.559 region:rollup2
By two guys who wanted to invite

00:57:07.457 --> 00:57:11.528 region:rollup2
her to a party. Of four hours

00:57:09.559 --> 00:57:12.095 region:rollup2
later she's in hot topics in

00:57:11.528 --> 00:57:13.363 region:rollup2
Alameda meeting a man for a

00:57:12.095 --> 00:57:13.997 region:rollup2
date.

00:57:13.363 --> 00:57:17.367 region:rollup2
In the short time that she was

00:57:13.997 --> 00:57:19.536 region:rollup2
the way she was taken to.

00:57:17.367 --> 00:57:23.573 region:rollup2
Hotels in Union City Hey would.

00:57:19.536 --> 00:57:23.941 region:rollup2
At San Jose Monterey and down to

00:57:23.573 --> 00:57:25.709 region:rollup2
because filled.

00:57:23.941 --> 00:57:27.477 region:rollup2
It was then that I learned how

00:57:25.709 --> 00:57:29.379 region:rollup2
multi jurisdictional this

00:57:27.477 --> 00:57:29.813 region:rollup2
problem is I'm how we all have

00:57:29.379 --> 00:57:31.782 region:rollup2
to work together.

00:57:29.813 --> 00:57:33.650 region:rollup2
It was actually the case

00:57:31.782 --> 00:57:34.284 region:rollup2
actually sent to because I had

00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:35.886 region:rollup2
no crime in Pittsburgh at that

00:57:34.284 --> 00:57:37.721 region:rollup2
time it was actually fought by a

00:57:35.886 --> 00:57:39.389 region:rollup2
union city down in Alameda

00:57:37.721 --> 00:57:41.491 region:rollup2
county.

00:57:39.389 --> 00:57:41.625 region:rollup2
Big I have for me.

00:57:41.491 --> 00:57:43.760 region:rollup2
.

00:57:41.625 --> 00:57:45.629 region:rollup2
Fourteen years old my daughter

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:47.397 region:rollup2
at the time was fourteen. The.

00:57:45.629 --> 00:57:49.700 region:rollup2
.

00:57:47.397 --> 00:57:51.401 region:rollup2
The victim ended up being my

00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:53.904 region:rollup2
told his. Best friend's cousin.

00:57:51.401 --> 00:57:55.405 region:rollup2
So that's really kind of what

00:57:53.904 --> 00:57:57.607 region:rollup2
board come to me just how close

00:57:55.405 --> 00:57:59.443 region:rollup2
this is and how how it affects

00:57:57.607 --> 00:58:00.043 region:rollup2
us Texas all.

00:57:59.443 --> 00:58:00.310 region:rollup2
So we were given today some

00:58:00.043 --> 00:58:03.347 region:rollup2
questions.

00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:03.947 region:rollup2
.

00:58:03.347 --> 00:58:05.615 region:rollup2
And I kind of just a bullet

00:58:03.947 --> 00:58:07.484 region:rollup2
point I didn't know how to kind

00:58:05.615 --> 00:58:09.519 region:rollup2
of present this so one of the

00:58:07.484 --> 00:58:11.521 region:rollup2
questions was was has a human

00:58:09.519 --> 00:58:13.390 region:rollup2
trafficking changed. Yes in the

00:58:11.521 --> 00:58:14.024 region:rollup2
last ten years I've seen big

00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:15.425 region:rollup2
changes in this and especially

00:58:14.024 --> 00:58:17.527 region:rollup2
since two thousand eleven.

00:58:15.425 --> 00:58:17.794 region:rollup2
And the biggest change for me

00:58:17.527 --> 00:58:19.496 region:rollup2
as well.

00:58:17.794 --> 00:58:21.431 region:rollup2
Arent differ are you just spoke

00:58:19.496 --> 00:58:23.433 region:rollup2
about. Was the social media.

00:58:21.431 --> 00:58:24.101 region:rollup2
I am seeing off.

00:58:23.433 --> 00:58:25.435 region:rollup2
Social media just explode with.

00:58:24.101 --> 00:58:27.437 region:rollup2
.

00:58:25.435 --> 00:58:29.639 region:rollup2
Pandering.

00:58:27.437 --> 00:58:31.808 region:rollup2
You know recruitment I monitors

00:58:29.639 --> 00:58:35.545 region:rollup2
social media and and justice

00:58:31.808 --> 00:58:37.714 region:rollup2
quick case a few weeks ago I had

00:58:35.545 --> 00:58:39.883 region:rollup2
my I have multiple screens on my

00:58:37.714 --> 00:58:41.718 region:rollup2
desk. And I had my Facebook feed

00:58:39.883 --> 00:58:43.687 region:rollup2
up and Facebook live popped up

00:58:41.718 --> 00:58:45.455 region:rollup2
this that young man trying to

00:58:43.687 --> 00:58:47.357 region:rollup2
get to go into a vehicle. I this

00:58:45.455 --> 00:58:47.991 region:rollup2
kind of.

00:58:47.357 --> 00:58:49.760 region:rollup2
Struck a red flag with me so I

00:58:47.991 --> 00:58:51.728 region:rollup2
did a a workup on this this

00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:53.764 region:rollup2
gentleman he lived in Antioch.

00:58:51.728 --> 00:58:55.499 region:rollup2
And it during the work up I

00:58:53.764 --> 00:58:56.166 region:rollup2
found his phone number and that

00:58:55.499 --> 00:58:57.367 region:rollup2
phone number was a satiated to

00:58:56.166 --> 00:58:59.803 region:rollup2
prostitution acts.

00:58:57.367 --> 00:59:01.805 region:rollup2
I said all this information over

00:58:59.803 --> 00:59:03.607 region:rollup2
to Anya out PT annual PP started

00:59:01.805 --> 00:59:05.375 region:rollup2
building a case on him in the

00:59:03.607 --> 00:59:07.511 region:rollup2
meantime I had a runaway

00:59:05.375 --> 00:59:09.679 region:rollup2
juvenile from Pittsburgh. And.

00:59:07.511 --> 00:59:11.615 region:rollup2
Richmond PD picked up they sent

00:59:09.679 --> 00:59:11.915 region:rollup2
me a picture they found on her

00:59:11.615 --> 00:59:13.784 region:rollup2
cell phone.

00:59:11.915 --> 00:59:15.519 region:rollup2
From her Instagram account and

00:59:13.784 --> 00:59:18.000 region:rollup2
then like do you know this guy

00:59:15.519 --> 00:59:18.000 region:rollup2
and I'm like well yes I do.

00:59:18.055 --> 00:59:21.691 region:rollup2
trying to get and I got into a

00:59:19.790 --> 00:59:23.527 region:rollup2
cough so this is why all social

00:59:21.691 --> 00:59:25.729 region:rollup2
media has to be monitored I'm on

00:59:23.527 --> 00:59:27.531 region:rollup2
it I literally I'm on it even a

00:59:25.729 --> 00:59:29.399 region:rollup2
home at eleven o'clock at night.

00:59:27.531 --> 00:59:31.501 region:rollup2
Just scrolling through Instagram

00:59:29.399 --> 00:59:33.570 region:rollup2
Facebook life Snapchat I don't

00:59:31.501 --> 00:59:35.472 region:rollup2
tweet I don't have time for it.

00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:37.574 region:rollup2
So I'm big.

00:59:35.472 --> 00:59:39.576 region:rollup2
Big changes that.

00:59:37.574 --> 00:59:41.478 region:rollup2
Another change I've seen is.

00:59:39.576 --> 00:59:43.547 region:rollup2
It's been glorified.

00:59:41.478 --> 00:59:45.615 region:rollup2
You know we have this

00:59:43.547 --> 00:59:47.584 region:rollup2
glorification that we have

00:59:45.615 --> 00:59:49.619 region:rollup2
comedy be we have Nicki Minaj we

00:59:47.584 --> 00:59:51.755 region:rollup2
have JZ all rapping about human

00:59:49.619 --> 00:59:53.757 region:rollup2
trafficking. And it has been

00:59:51.755 --> 00:59:55.759 region:rollup2
glorified with sending this

00:59:53.757 --> 00:59:57.694 region:rollup2
message to all our youth that

00:59:55.759 --> 01:00:01.431 region:rollup2
this is okay and it's not.

00:59:57.694 --> 01:00:01.631 region:rollup2
I seen a big big changes and

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:03.467 region:rollup2
that.

01:00:01.631 --> 01:00:05.702 region:rollup2
We talked I am saying.

01:00:03.467 --> 01:00:07.737 region:rollup2
Pandering for the internet I

01:00:05.702 --> 01:00:09.739 region:rollup2
just had a case of a girl who

01:00:07.737 --> 01:00:11.608 region:rollup2
returned home she was a

01:00:09.739 --> 01:00:13.610 region:rollup2
Pittsburgh run away. As she let

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:14.211 region:rollup2
me look up her phone and what I

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:15.979 region:rollup2
was going for her phone they

01:00:14.211 --> 01:00:17.681 region:rollup2
don't think I'm going to be able

01:00:15.979 --> 01:00:18.315 region:rollup2
to find much on the phone they

01:00:17.681 --> 01:00:19.850 region:rollup2
don't think I'm really that sad

01:00:18.315 --> 01:00:21.485 region:rollup2
because I'm a fifty year old

01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:22.085 region:rollup2
grandma.

01:00:21.485 --> 01:00:23.854 region:rollup2
But I know my way around the

01:00:22.085 --> 01:00:25.922 region:rollup2
phone and as I was going for

01:00:23.854 --> 01:00:27.757 region:rollup2
this phone I found that she was

01:00:25.922 --> 01:00:29.526 region:rollup2
being pandered by her friend a

01:00:27.757 --> 01:00:30.093 region:rollup2
seventeen year old friend was

01:00:29.526 --> 01:00:33.597 region:rollup2
telling her to contact an

01:00:30.093 --> 01:00:33.797 region:rollup2
exploiter. In Sacramento to make

01:00:33.597 --> 01:00:35.499 region:rollup2
money.

01:00:33.797 --> 01:00:36.166 region:rollup2
.

01:00:35.499 --> 01:00:37.734 region:rollup2
That's just not acceptable when

01:00:36.166 --> 01:00:39.536 region:rollup2
did it become OK to friends to

01:00:37.734 --> 01:00:42.105 region:rollup2
refer friends to exploit as.

01:00:39.536 --> 01:00:45.642 region:rollup2
One the other things I'm seeing

01:00:42.105 --> 01:00:46.309 region:rollup2
is tattooing and branding. I've

01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:48.011 region:rollup2
got girls as young as thirteen

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:51.548 region:rollup2
but tattoos of the exploit its

01:00:48.011 --> 01:00:52.215 region:rollup2
name on them. And this is kind

01:00:51.548 --> 01:00:52.816 region:rollup2
of late on the list I want to

01:00:52.215 --> 01:01:01.691 region:rollup2
talk about maybe we mandating

01:00:52.816 --> 01:01:03.627 region:rollup2
them as mandated

01:01:01.691 --> 01:01:05.862 region:rollup2
reporters if they suspect human

01:01:03.627 --> 01:01:07.564 region:rollup2
trafficking and possibly going

01:01:05.862 --> 01:01:11.735 region:rollup2
after these.

01:01:07.564 --> 01:01:15.605 region:rollup2
Tattoo artists for tattooing a

01:01:11.735 --> 01:01:16.239 region:rollup2
thirteen year old it's illegal.

01:01:15.605 --> 01:01:17.607 region:rollup2
So I'd like to see sort of more

01:01:16.239 --> 01:01:21.578 region:rollup2
that.

01:01:17.607 --> 01:01:22.112 region:rollup2
I am seeing more about victims

01:01:21.578 --> 01:01:23.613 region:rollup2
being trafficked in more

01:01:22.112 --> 01:01:27.551 region:rollup2
affluent areas.

01:01:23.613 --> 01:01:29.553 region:rollup2
Before the fires and I had

01:01:27.551 --> 01:01:31.821 region:rollup2
quite a few up in the Santa Rosa

01:01:29.553 --> 01:01:33.723 region:rollup2
area assignment file seen them

01:01:31.821 --> 01:01:35.725 region:rollup2
going down to Santa Clara I'm

01:01:33.723 --> 01:01:37.694 region:rollup2
not saying it's not still

01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:33.750 region:rollup2
I'm going to go into it just a

01:02:31.781 --> 01:02:34.317 region:rollup2
little case. Auto unite what

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:36.086 region:rollup2
many cases together. But we

01:02:34.317 --> 01:02:39.756 region:rollup2

And we worked this case together

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:53.703 region:rollup2

thirteen fourteen year old.

01:02:53.703 --> 01:02:56.406 region:rollup2
Although she won't admit the

01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:57.841 region:rollup2
trafficking it led to another

01:02:56.406 --> 01:02:58.441 region:rollup2
victim which led to another

01:02:57.841 --> 01:03:00.143 region:rollup2
victim I think at this point

01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:03.713 region:rollup2
where now it fourteen victims.

01:03:00.143 --> 01:03:04.314 region:rollup2
From around wait

01:03:03.713 --> 01:03:07.717 region:rollup2
I'm hoping they get this guy

01:03:04.314 --> 01:03:09.719 region:rollup2
very soon.

01:03:07.717 --> 01:03:13.790 region:rollup2
Room.

faith based groups I'm I'm very

01:03:16.059 --> 01:03:18.461 region:rollup2
involved in that as a lot of the

01:03:17.827 --> 01:03:20.063 region:rollup2
other agents who thought they

01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:20.330 region:rollup2

01:03:20.063 --> 01:03:22.165 region:rollup2
resource.

01:03:20.330 --> 01:03:23.733 region:rollup2
So we really recognize the value

01:03:22.165 --> 01:03:27.737 region:rollup2
of all these groups.

01:03:23.733 --> 01:03:29.939 region:rollup2

a manpower issue.

01:03:31.875 --> 01:03:36.046 region:rollup2
You know we'd like to see more.

01:03:33.777 --> 01:03:37.981 region:rollup2
Funding and resources to help us

01:03:36.046 --> 01:03:39.883 region:rollup2
with that but we do need to do

01:03:37.981 --> 01:03:40.483 region:rollup2
these John and.

01:03:39.883 --> 01:03:42.218 region:rollup2
Exploiter operations and I am

01:03:40.483 --> 01:03:43.820 region:rollup2
especially passionate about the.

The purchases

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:47.857 region:rollup2

01:03:46.022 --> 01:03:49.926 region:rollup2
off to them I it's a

01:03:47.857 --> 01:03:52.162 region:rollup2
preventative measure. And like

01:03:49.926 --> 01:03:53.830 region:rollup2
the idea of ID said we need to

01:03:52.162 --> 01:03:55.732 region:rollup2
be. You know that they need

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:56.199 region:rollup2
these to ninety registrations

01:03:55.732 --> 01:03:58.234 region:rollup2

01:03:56.199 --> 01:04:01.805 region:rollup2
You we need to be getting.

01:03:58.234 --> 01:04:03.807 region:rollup2
More prosecutions on them I

01:04:01.805 --> 01:04:05.809 region:rollup2

I got over thirty men China by

01:04:12.182 --> 01:04:14.617 region:rollup2
this goal on that phone. I have

01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:16.286 region:rollup2
she looks like she's nine years

01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:21.891 region:rollup2
resources to go off to every

01:04:18.488 --> 01:04:22.459 region:rollup2

01:04:21.891 --> 01:04:22.692 region:rollup2
that was trying to buy these

01:04:22.459 --> 01:04:25.829 region:rollup2
female.

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:27.864 region:rollup2
.

01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:28.498 region:rollup2
We are out in the schools and

01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:30.133 region:rollup2
then the community I just last

01:04:28.498 --> 01:04:30.400 region:rollup2
week trying to one of the high

01:04:30.133 --> 01:04:32.202 region:rollup2
schools.

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:35.905 region:rollup2
We need to be doing more might

01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:36.573 region:rollup2
target area for business it's my

01:04:35.905 --> 01:04:37.941 region:rollup2
opinion it's not depend on the

01:04:36.573 --> 01:04:38.541 region:rollup2
police department we meet need

01:04:37.941 --> 01:04:39.976 region:rollup2
for teaching awful for fifth

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:41.845 region:rollup2
graders.

01:04:39.976 --> 01:04:42.278 region:rollup2
We need to be out that educating

01:04:41.845 --> 01:04:44.481 region:rollup2
them at that age.

01:04:42.278 --> 01:04:46.282 region:rollup2
By high school it's too late by

01:04:44.481 --> 01:04:47.951 region:rollup2
middle school it's almost too

01:04:46.282 --> 01:04:49.853 region:rollup2
late my youngest victim for me

01:04:47.951 --> 01:04:52.122 region:rollup2
has been the eleven.

01:04:49.853 --> 01:04:54.190 region:rollup2
I we need to be talking about

01:04:52.122 --> 01:04:56.192 region:rollup2
recognizing the signs that said

01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:58.161 region:rollup2
early on and and that parents

01:04:56.192 --> 01:04:59.863 region:rollup2
the parents need to be involved

01:04:58.161 --> 01:05:01.931 region:rollup2
in this education.

01:04:59.863 --> 01:05:03.833 region:rollup2
I have department training hard

01:05:01.931 --> 01:05:04.467 region:rollup2

01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:06.069 region:rollup2
trafficking recognize the signs

01:05:04.467 --> 01:05:08.405 region:rollup2
of human trafficking.

01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:10.140 region:rollup2
I believe they should have more

01:05:08.405 --> 01:05:11.908 region:rollup2
but again it's that time in a

01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:14.010 region:rollup2
funding issue.

01:05:11.908 --> 01:05:14.677 region:rollup2

01:05:16.179 --> 01:05:20.183 region:rollup2
lot of fun. I was surprised how

01:05:18.114 --> 01:05:20.784 region:rollup2

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:27.991 region:rollup2
I know they'll be enough one

01:05:26.489 --> 01:05:30.260 region:rollup2
coming up.

01:05:27.991 --> 01:05:31.961 region:rollup2
We work very closely with neck

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:33.963 region:rollup2
mac and national Senate missing

01:05:31.961 --> 01:05:34.531 region:rollup2
exploited children huge resource

01:05:33.963 --> 01:05:38.301 region:rollup2
are often norm Forstmann.

01:05:34.531 --> 01:05:39.969 region:rollup2
I'm one of things I like about

01:05:38.301 --> 01:05:40.537 region:rollup2
the national citizens when

01:05:39.969 --> 01:05:42.105 region:rollup2

on.

01:05:43.973 --> 01:05:48.211 region:rollup2
You know possible exploit is

01:05:46.109 --> 01:05:50.013 region:rollup2
and they they will help with

01:05:48.211 --> 01:05:52.115 region:rollup2
that they also get the flies out

01:05:50.013 --> 01:05:53.983 region:rollup2
for you and they keep track of

01:05:52.115 --> 01:05:57.954 region:rollup2
data. So they are keeping a

01:05:53.983 --> 01:05:58.655 region:rollup2
track of. The amount of.

01:05:57.954 --> 01:06:00.256 region:rollup2
Since you know and that's why we

01:05:58.655 --> 01:06:00.423 region:rollup2
really need to all be referring

01:06:00.256 --> 01:06:02.459 region:rollup2
op.

Children to neck neck so they

01:06:02.459 --> 01:06:06.162 region:rollup2
can keep better statistics.

01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:07.897 region:rollup2
That we have a wonderful

01:07:26.676 --> 01:07:30.213 region:rollup2
media if we didn't have that

01:07:28.411 --> 01:07:34.083 region:rollup2
warrant we probably would not go

01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:36.085 region:rollup2
ahead back to get have safe.

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:38.054 region:rollup2
.

01:07:36.085 --> 01:07:38.655 region:rollup2
One of the things when our full

01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:39.956 region:rollup2
spent sorry I would note we

01:07:38.655 --> 01:07:40.590 region:rollup2
really have to develop good

01:07:39.956 --> 01:07:42.091 region:rollup2
relationships of the families of

01:07:40.590 --> 01:07:42.725 region:rollup2
these.

01:07:42.091 --> 01:07:44.360 region:rollup2
Not a white cities trafficking

01:07:42.725 --> 01:07:44.961 region:rollup2
victims because they are help

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.995 region:rollup2
these girls often reach out to

01:07:44.961 --> 01:07:48.031 region:rollup2
them.

01:07:45.995 --> 01:07:50.366 region:rollup2
And they give us information and

01:07:48.031 --> 01:07:52.435 region:rollup2
it's a it's really important to.

01:07:50.366 --> 01:07:54.003 region:rollup2
Have a good relationship with

01:07:52.435 --> 01:07:56.439 region:rollup2
these these families.

01:07:54.003 --> 01:07:58.041 region:rollup2
A for the questions office

01:07:56.439 --> 01:08:00.143 region:rollup2
varias I think.

01:07:58.041 --> 01:08:02.045 region:rollup2
The biggest barrier is keeping

01:08:00.143 --> 01:08:04.013 region:rollup2
the juvenile safe that's the.

01:08:02.045 --> 01:08:04.681 region:rollup2
Biggest problem that we have in

01:08:04.013 --> 01:08:06.582 region:rollup2
my ideal world we'd be building

01:08:04.681 --> 01:08:08.418 region:rollup2
a home on the top of a mountain

01:08:06.582 --> 01:08:08.651 region:rollup2
surrounded by bats coyotes the

01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:10.520 region:rollup2
snakes.

01:08:08.651 --> 01:08:12.355 region:rollup2
So these girls would not run

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:14.290 region:rollup2
because they also into the life

01:08:12.355 --> 01:08:16.359 region:rollup2
that they do run that we need

01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:16.759 region:rollup2
the support in the counseling in

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:18.027 region:rollup2
the help for them.

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:20.229 region:rollup2
.

01:08:18.027 --> 01:08:21.998 region:rollup2
We as we talked about we are

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:22.565 region:rollup2
century victimizing our children

01:08:21.998 --> 01:08:24.033 region:rollup2
right now because we cannot

01:08:22.565 --> 01:08:26.569 region:rollup2
detain them.

01:08:24.033 --> 01:08:28.471 region:rollup2
Of various is then not willing

01:08:26.569 --> 01:08:30.073 region:rollup2
to talk they've they often don't

01:08:28.471 --> 01:08:32.442 region:rollup2
see themselves as the victim.

01:08:30.073 --> 01:08:34.410 region:rollup2
And that's a huge problem for us

01:08:32.442 --> 01:08:36.245 region:rollup2
I'd like to go in when I find a

01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:38.247 region:rollup2
victim I to talk to on a Friday

01:08:36.245 --> 01:08:40.350 region:rollup2
because I don't write uniform on

01:08:38.247 --> 01:08:40.917 region:rollup2
Friday I got my civilian clothes

01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:42.352 region:rollup2
to welcome Friday. And that

01:08:40.917 --> 01:08:46.055 region:rollup2
because I'm not in a police

01:08:42.352 --> 01:08:46.756 region:rollup2
uniform. I'm a mom I my grandma

01:08:46.055 --> 01:08:48.558 region:rollup2
they do tend to open up a little

01:08:46.756 --> 01:08:50.493 region:rollup2
bit. But not very often you know

01:08:48.558 --> 01:08:52.362 region:rollup2
but it does help that time not

01:08:50.493 --> 01:08:54.097 region:rollup2
seen as a person of law

01:08:52.362 --> 01:08:56.232 region:rollup2
enforcement.

01:08:54.097 --> 01:08:56.866 region:rollup2
We have the reluctance the often

01:08:56.232 --> 01:08:58.101 region:rollup2
very reluctant to get out of the

01:08:56.866 --> 01:08:58.301 region:rollup2
life.

01:08:58.101 --> 01:09:00.436 region:rollup2
They.

01:08:58.301 --> 01:09:02.138 region:rollup2
They see that exploiters that

01:09:00.436 --> 01:09:02.872 region:rollup2
provider.

01:09:02.138 --> 01:09:04.507 region:rollup2
And that's very hard that trauma

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:05.108 region:rollup2
bond that was spoken about

01:09:04.507 --> 01:09:08.144 region:rollup2
earlier is very very hard to

01:09:05.108 --> 01:09:10.179 region:rollup2
break.

01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:10.780 region:rollup2
The resources needed was one of

01:09:10.179 --> 01:09:12.548 region:rollup2
the questions funding we need

01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:14.217 region:rollup2
funding we need more people we

01:09:12.548 --> 01:09:16.519 region:rollup2
need more help.

01:09:14.217 --> 01:09:18.121 region:rollup2
This is this is a giant battle

01:09:16.519 --> 01:09:20.123 region:rollup2
that we're facing right now.

01:09:18.121 --> 01:09:22.125 region:rollup2
.

01:09:20.123 --> 01:09:22.592 region:rollup2
A kid housing for juveniles I

01:09:22.125 --> 01:09:24.293 region:rollup2
just spoke about that

01:09:22.592 --> 01:09:26.329 region:rollup2
specialized housing for adult

01:09:24.293 --> 01:09:26.829 region:rollup2
victims that's open twenty four

01:09:26.329 --> 01:09:28.131 region:rollup2
seven that's nothing was

01:09:26.829 --> 01:09:30.299 region:rollup2
someone.

01:09:28.131 --> 01:09:30.900 region:rollup2
Tony and I have we had if I had

01:09:30.299 --> 01:09:34.137 region:rollup2
this a few weeks ago we find a

01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:36.272 region:rollup2
victim.

01:09:34.137 --> 01:09:36.839 region:rollup2
I am the thin air space like a

01:09:36.272 --> 01:09:38.341 region:rollup2
put who was in fact filled.

01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:40.376 region:rollup2
You no we need some think that

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:42.178 region:rollup2
we can we can keep them you know

01:09:40.376 --> 01:09:44.180 region:rollup2
low because they.

01:09:42.178 --> 01:09:46.382 region:rollup2
But away from their exploiters.

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:48.184 region:rollup2
So what can the legislative do

01:09:46.382 --> 01:09:50.186 region:rollup2
then this is just.

01:09:48.184 --> 01:09:52.288 region:rollup2
Mike my feelings.

01:09:50.186 --> 01:09:54.457 region:rollup2
Pacha cuts the time for

01:09:52.288 --> 01:09:56.225 region:rollup2
suspects said Diamanti talked

01:09:54.457 --> 01:09:58.161 region:rollup2
about that many big proponent of

01:09:56.225 --> 01:10:00.196 region:rollup2
that let's put these guys away

01:09:58.161 --> 01:10:02.331 region:rollup2
for a very very long time.

01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:04.200 region:rollup2
Funding for personnel to work

01:10:02.331 --> 01:10:06.402 region:rollup2
these cases education I spoke

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:08.204 region:rollup2
about that harsher sentences for

01:10:06.402 --> 01:10:10.573 region:rollup2
the buyers I spoke about that.

01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:12.141 region:rollup2
I really to see some kind of.

01:10:10.573 --> 01:10:14.243 region:rollup2
.

01:10:12.141 --> 01:10:16.579 region:rollup2
Penalize ation for hotels.

01:10:14.243 --> 01:10:18.414 region:rollup2
I just had a fourteen year old I

01:10:16.579 --> 01:10:20.383 region:rollup2
just spoke to and she was

01:10:18.414 --> 01:10:22.418 region:rollup2
telling me that. The exploit a

01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:24.120 region:rollup2
was given the hotel five hundred

01:10:22.418 --> 01:10:26.122 region:rollup2
dollars.

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:28.257 region:rollup2
To keep quiet.

01:10:26.122 --> 01:10:28.891 region:rollup2
So I really think that you know

01:10:28.257 --> 01:10:30.393 region:rollup2
we meet we nay to start going

01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:32.528 region:rollup2
off the hotels and and and into

01:10:30.393 --> 01:10:34.130 region:rollup2
prosecuting them for tying the

01:10:32.528 --> 01:10:38.101 region:rollup2
blind diet such.

01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:40.136 region:rollup2
Mandate tattoo parlors and now

01:10:38.101 --> 01:10:42.305 region:rollup2
follow up and nail salon spear.

01:10:40.136 --> 01:10:44.240 region:rollup2
Mandated reporters I I think you

01:10:42.305 --> 01:10:46.175 region:rollup2
know the schools alumni had done

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:48.144 region:rollup2
they one that now it's done.

01:10:46.175 --> 01:10:50.179 region:rollup2
But I think that's a great place

01:10:48.144 --> 01:10:50.413 region:rollup2
to start especially the talk to.

01:10:50.179 --> 01:10:54.183 region:rollup2
Pause.

01:10:50.413 --> 01:10:56.385 region:rollup2
A jurisdiction.

01:10:54.183 --> 01:11:00.123 region:rollup2
Right now if.

01:10:56.385 --> 01:11:00.723 region:rollup2
But I'd I'm not a legal person

01:11:00.123 --> 01:11:02.558 region:rollup2
I don't quite know how this

01:11:00.723 --> 01:11:04.160 region:rollup2
works but I've just had a case

01:11:02.558 --> 01:11:06.529 region:rollup2
of a.

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:08.498 region:rollup2
Spec all. And nothing happened

01:11:06.529 --> 01:11:10.233 region:rollup2
in Contra Costa county and it

01:11:08.498 --> 01:11:10.833 region:rollup2
was all in Alameda county so

01:11:10.233 --> 01:11:12.635 region:rollup2
that is actually going down I

01:11:10.833 --> 01:11:14.504 region:rollup2
spoke to he would PD in that's

01:11:12.635 --> 01:11:16.239 region:rollup2
going down be filed next week

01:11:14.504 --> 01:11:18.241 region:rollup2
and Hey what it.

01:11:16.239 --> 01:11:20.343 region:rollup2
But why copy five hit.

01:11:18.241 --> 01:11:22.445 region:rollup2
You know I mean I victims here I

01:11:20.343 --> 01:11:22.712 region:rollup2
I'd like to see you know if it's

01:11:22.445 --> 01:11:24.247 region:rollup2
my case.

01:11:22.712 --> 01:11:26.682 region:rollup2
I should own it.

01:11:24.247 --> 01:11:26.883 region:rollup2
Rob wouldn't give it to someone

01:11:26.682 --> 01:11:28.751 region:rollup2
else.

01:11:26.883 --> 01:11:30.553 region:rollup2
Then that's just my personal

01:11:28.751 --> 01:11:32.622 region:rollup2
opinion but I'd like to see

01:11:30.553 --> 01:11:34.223 region:rollup2
maybe you know at some changes

01:11:32.622 --> 01:11:34.624 region:rollup2
that.

01:11:34.223 --> 01:11:36.225 region:rollup2
And another thing.

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:38.528 region:rollup2
.

01:11:36.225 --> 01:11:40.396 region:rollup2
Is hippa I mean we kind of

01:11:38.528 --> 01:11:42.231 region:rollup2
spoken out earlier I had a big

01:11:40.396 --> 01:11:44.400 region:rollup2
debate with adulta.

01:11:42.231 --> 01:11:46.269 region:rollup2
About he was telling me how he

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.836 region:rollup2
knew who these skills quirk who

01:11:46.269 --> 01:11:48.638 region:rollup2
the trafficking victims web

01:11:46.836 --> 01:11:50.640 region:rollup2
because. Basically he was an

01:11:48.638 --> 01:11:52.341 region:rollup2
OBGYN and they were coming in

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:54.343 region:rollup2
and he was cleaning them up. And

01:11:52.341 --> 01:11:54.911 region:rollup2
three months later they were

01:11:54.343 --> 01:11:56.646 region:rollup2
back again I might but your

01:11:54.911 --> 01:11:58.281 region:rollup2
mandate a report he says but

01:11:56.646 --> 01:12:00.716 region:rollup2
that protected by hip.

01:11:58.281 --> 01:12:02.585 region:rollup2
So I again I'm not legal I don't

01:12:00.716 --> 01:12:04.554 region:rollup2
know how that works but it he

01:12:02.585 --> 01:12:06.689 region:rollup2
signalman recognizing them.

01:12:04.554 --> 01:12:08.524 region:rollup2
Out opposite doing that then

01:12:06.689 --> 01:12:10.259 region:rollup2
maybe we need to make some

01:12:08.524 --> 01:12:12.562 region:rollup2
changes right that.

01:12:10.259 --> 01:12:16.265 region:rollup2
And I think that's about all I

01:12:12.562 --> 01:12:18.401 region:rollup2
have to say.

01:12:16.265 --> 01:12:18.935 region:rollup2
But just and is there anything

01:12:18.401 --> 01:12:20.269 region:rollup2
else the safety corporate

01:12:18.935 --> 01:12:20.937 region:rollup2
really.

01:12:20.269 --> 01:12:22.305 region:rollup2
Actually no that's actually Y.

01:12:20.937 --> 01:12:24.307 region:rollup2
one Louise to go first.

01:12:22.305 --> 01:12:26.275 region:rollup2
Always very thorough.

01:12:24.307 --> 01:12:26.976 region:rollup2
I'm one things I want to talk

01:12:26.275 --> 01:12:28.744 region:rollup2
about it's been said before but.

01:12:26.976 --> 01:12:30.613 region:rollup2
I want to reiterate it we need a

01:12:28.744 --> 01:12:32.381 region:rollup2
multi angle approach we have

01:12:30.613 --> 01:12:32.949 region:rollup2
take out every lake of this

01:12:32.381 --> 01:12:34.317 region:rollup2
chair if we want to bring it

01:12:32.949 --> 01:12:36.285 region:rollup2
down.

01:12:34.317 --> 01:12:38.254 region:rollup2
We have to target the buyers.

01:12:36.285 --> 01:12:38.821 region:rollup2
Stricter penalties

01:12:38.254 --> 01:12:42.291 region:rollup2
because for people who are

01:12:38.821 --> 01:12:42.892 region:rollup2
buying these children.

01:12:42.291 --> 01:12:44.393 region:rollup2
Against the pimps we'd have

01:12:42.892 --> 01:12:46.329 region:rollup2
aggressive investigation by the

01:12:44.393 --> 01:12:46.963 region:rollup2
police officers.

01:12:46.329 --> 01:12:48.731 region:rollup2
The more training we have the

01:12:46.963 --> 01:12:50.333 region:rollup2
better the more we know how to

01:12:48.731 --> 01:12:50.967 region:rollup2
do our jobs better.

01:12:50.333 --> 01:12:54.337 region:rollup2
And then cooperation with our de

01:12:50.967 --> 01:12:54.904 region:rollup2
is.

01:12:54.337 --> 01:12:56.372 region:rollup2
To insure the prosecution.

01:12:54.904 --> 01:12:58.374 region:rollup2
And also and.

01:12:56.372 --> 01:13:00.443 region:rollup2
Certainly important I can't.

01:12:58.374 --> 01:13:00.676 region:rollup2
Stressed enough to provide

01:13:00.443 --> 01:13:02.678 region:rollup2
services

01:13:00.676 --> 01:13:04.280 region:rollup2
services and to be available

01:13:02.678 --> 01:13:04.647 region:rollup2
twenty four hours.

01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:06.382 region:rollup2
I work nights.

01:13:04.647 --> 01:13:08.751 region:rollup2

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:30.880 region:rollup2
coalition has been around for

01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:34.617 region:rollup2
about.

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:35.184 region:rollup2
Ten years you know community.

01:17:34.617 --> 01:17:36.919 region:rollup2

Back in two thousand one we

01:17:45.227 --> 01:17:48.631 region:rollup2
weren't really thinking about to

01:17:46.762 --> 01:17:50.599 region:rollup2
identify human trafficking.

01:17:48.631 --> 01:17:52.601 region:rollup2

two thousand seven the coalition

01:17:52.601 --> 01:17:54.870 region:rollup2

01:18:50.893 --> 01:18:54.663 region:rollup2
seventeen we assisted three

01:18:52.761 --> 01:18:55.297 region:rollup2
thousand four hundred families

01:18:54.663 --> 01:18:57.066 region:rollup2
there was an increase of about

01:18:55.297 --> 01:18:58.968 region:rollup2
twenty five percent from two

01:18:57.066 --> 01:18:59.268 region:rollup2
thousand succeed. So the word is

01:18:58.968 --> 01:19:01.236 region:rollup2
out there.

01:18:59.268 --> 01:19:03.138 region:rollup2
To any victims of interpersonal

01:19:01.236 --> 01:19:06.709 region:rollup2
violence that could come to the

01:19:03.138 --> 01:19:07.276 region:rollup2
family justice advocate and get

01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:07.476 region:rollup2
the health and healing they

01:19:07.276 --> 01:19:09.011 region:rollup2
need.

01:19:07.476 --> 01:19:10.779 region:rollup2
I in terms of human trafficking

01:19:09.011 --> 01:19:12.781 region:rollup2
becomes aye in Alice center in

01:19:10.779 --> 01:19:13.415 region:rollup2
two thousand seventeen about two

01:19:12.781 --> 01:19:14.750 region:rollup2
percent of our clients who are

01:19:13.415 --> 01:19:17.019 region:rollup2
trafficking victims.

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:18.721 region:rollup2
Yes it is a small number

01:19:17.019 --> 01:19:20.756 region:rollup2
compared to the rest of us

01:19:18.721 --> 01:19:21.290 region:rollup2
becomes but it is increasing.

01:19:20.756 --> 01:19:23.125 region:rollup2
And is increasing because

01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:25.060 region:rollup2
there's more awareness of our

01:19:23.125 --> 01:19:26.895 region:rollup2
community more identification by

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:28.664 region:rollup2
providers and also more

01:19:26.895 --> 01:19:29.198 region:rollup2
referrals from.

01:19:28.664 --> 01:19:30.966 region:rollup2
Law enforcement partners

01:19:29.198 --> 01:19:32.868 region:rollup2
so I think this collaborative

01:19:30.966 --> 01:19:34.737 region:rollup2
approach of public private

01:19:32.868 --> 01:19:35.304 region:rollup2
partnership you know county

01:19:34.737 --> 01:19:36.805 region:rollup2
really has been working very

01:19:35.304 --> 01:19:37.339 region:rollup2
well.

01:19:36.805 --> 01:19:38.807 region:rollup2
In addition to providing.

01:19:37.339 --> 01:19:41.110 region:rollup2
.

01:19:38.807 --> 01:19:43.045 region:rollup2
Bond services I coordination for

01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:45.180 region:rollup2
the victim services we provide

01:19:43.045 --> 01:19:46.782 region:rollup2
capacity the opportunities that

01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:48.851 region:rollup2
the family justice than a. Real

01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:50.686 region:rollup2
run a school called the family

01:19:48.851 --> 01:19:51.320 region:rollup2
justice institute.

01:19:50.686 --> 01:19:53.022 region:rollup2
So the insecurity is really a

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:54.890 region:rollup2
learning opportunity for a lot

01:19:53.022 --> 01:19:56.925 region:rollup2
of our service providers and

01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:58.961 region:rollup2
community members so just this

01:19:56.925 --> 01:20:00.729 region:rollup2
morning we had we are offering

01:19:58.961 --> 01:20:02.865 region:rollup2
human trafficking one a one. So

01:20:00.729 --> 01:20:03.432 region:rollup2
most of our providers Dugdale at

01:20:02.865 --> 01:20:04.900 region:rollup2
the family justice center

01:20:03.432 --> 01:20:06.969 region:rollup2
learning about him in

01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:07.436 region:rollup2
trafficking and they are not

01:20:06.969 --> 01:20:09.104 region:rollup2
here for that reason.

01:20:07.436 --> 01:20:10.773 region:rollup2
So on the day we opened this

01:20:09.104 --> 01:20:11.273 region:rollup2
institutes registration on the

01:20:10.773 --> 01:20:13.042 region:rollup2
first day fifty people

01:20:11.273 --> 01:20:15.077 region:rollup2
registered so people overly

01:20:13.042 --> 01:20:15.577 region:rollup2
hungry for that knowledge about

01:20:15.077 --> 01:20:16.745 region:rollup2
human trafficking in our

01:20:15.577 --> 01:20:18.847 region:rollup2
community.

01:20:16.745 --> 01:20:20.916 region:rollup2
So we are offering another

01:20:18.847 --> 01:20:22.718 region:rollup2
workshop in February. And again

01:20:20.916 --> 01:20:24.787 region:rollup2
that one is sold out.

01:20:22.718 --> 01:20:26.689 region:rollup2
So there's just a lot more

01:20:24.787 --> 01:20:27.289 region:rollup2
interest in the topic and people

01:20:26.689 --> 01:20:30.726 region:rollup2
are learning about that so I

01:20:27.289 --> 01:20:31.327 region:rollup2
think that's really good news.

01:20:30.726 --> 01:20:32.861 region:rollup2
Another thing we do it the

01:20:31.327 --> 01:20:34.697 region:rollup2
family justice center in call

01:20:32.861 --> 01:20:36.832 region:rollup2
partnership with the coalition

01:20:34.697 --> 01:20:37.433 region:rollup2
is to avoid monthly my to this

01:20:36.832 --> 01:20:38.734 region:rollup2
very team review meeting. And

01:20:37.433 --> 01:20:40.936 region:rollup2
the key.

01:20:38.734 --> 01:20:42.771 region:rollup2
We started that in April two

01:20:40.936 --> 01:20:44.740 region:rollup2
thousand sixteen.

01:20:42.771 --> 01:20:45.407 region:rollup2
And between two thousand sixteen

01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:47.076 region:rollup2
are they put it doesn't sixteen

01:20:45.407 --> 01:20:48.877 region:rollup2
and December two thousand

01:20:47.076 --> 01:20:50.746 region:rollup2
seventeen we come being.

01:20:48.877 --> 01:20:52.748 region:rollup2
Fourteen and the team meetings

01:20:50.746 --> 01:20:53.349 region:rollup2
participated by fifteen to

01:20:52.748 --> 01:20:55.084 region:rollup2
twenty different partners so

01:20:53.349 --> 01:20:55.651 region:rollup2
that includes a district

01:20:55.084 --> 01:20:57.019 region:rollup2
attorney's office. Concord

01:20:55.651 --> 01:20:59.121 region:rollup2
police which were police

01:20:57.019 --> 01:21:01.223 region:rollup2
probation on nonprofit providers

01:20:59.121 --> 01:21:02.758 region:rollup2
and a lot of different different

01:21:01.223 --> 01:21:03.325 region:rollup2
professionals anywhere between

01:21:02.758 --> 01:21:05.060 region:rollup2
fifteen to twenty partners

01:21:03.325 --> 01:21:06.829 region:rollup2
coming together once a month. To

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:07.396 region:rollup2
discuss the most complex and

01:21:06.829 --> 01:21:08.797 region:rollup2
difficult human trafficking

01:21:07.396 --> 01:21:10.933 region:rollup2
cases.

01:21:08.797 --> 01:21:12.801 region:rollup2
So if we want to look at this

01:21:10.933 --> 01:21:13.369 region:rollup2
case is the fourteen case a

01:21:12.801 --> 01:21:14.803 region:rollup2
fifteen cases that we would

01:21:13.369 --> 01:21:16.839 region:rollup2
review together.

01:21:14.803 --> 01:21:17.439 region:rollup2
Or victims were female.

01:21:16.839 --> 01:21:18.841 region:rollup2
To what goal sex trafficking

01:21:17.439 --> 01:21:21.176 region:rollup2
cases.

01:21:18.841 --> 01:21:23.011 region:rollup2
One was at the old labor

01:21:21.176 --> 01:21:25.080 region:rollup2
trafficking case and twelve

01:21:23.011 --> 01:21:26.849 region:rollup2
cases involve children drug

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:28.784 region:rollup2
trafficking victims.

01:21:26.849 --> 01:21:29.351 region:rollup2
That kind of goes to show you

01:21:28.784 --> 01:21:30.819 region:rollup2
how in our community we were

01:21:29.351 --> 01:21:31.453 region:rollup2
the.

01:21:30.819 --> 01:21:32.821 region:rollup2
Up prioritize child trafficking

01:21:31.453 --> 01:21:35.257 region:rollup2
becomes.

01:21:32.821 --> 01:21:37.092 region:rollup2
If you ask this victims what

01:21:35.257 --> 01:21:38.827 region:rollup2
their needs are and we asked

01:21:37.092 --> 01:21:39.495 region:rollup2
them.

01:21:38.827 --> 01:21:40.829 region:rollup2
I guess can you guess number one

01:21:39.495 --> 01:21:42.831 region:rollup2
need.

01:21:40.829 --> 01:21:44.900 region:rollup2
Housing.

01:21:42.831 --> 01:21:45.567 region:rollup2
The second was education they

01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:47.236 region:rollup2
wanted to go back to school and

01:21:45.567 --> 01:21:49.104 region:rollup2
Lauren and we found that there

01:21:47.236 --> 01:21:49.738 region:rollup2
were barriers with these two

01:21:49.104 --> 01:21:50.873 region:rollup2
going to get back to school and

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:52.875 region:rollup2
a lot.

01:21:50.873 --> 01:21:54.843 region:rollup2
Third I mental health services.

01:21:52.875 --> 01:21:57.179 region:rollup2
Fourth legal services

01:21:54.843 --> 01:21:59.414 region:rollup2
and fifth need was jobs

01:21:57.179 --> 01:22:01.250 region:rollup2
so this five things basic things

01:21:59.414 --> 01:22:03.085 region:rollup2
that we or enjoy and our human

01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:06.855 region:rollup2
trafficking become source

01:22:03.085 --> 01:22:07.256 region:rollup2
identified as their top needs.

01:22:06.855 --> 01:22:09.291 region:rollup2
In addition to.

01:22:07.256 --> 01:22:11.026 region:rollup2
Up providing the services for

01:22:09.291 --> 01:22:12.828 region:rollup2
human trafficking becomes our

01:22:11.026 --> 01:22:14.963 region:rollup2
and the team meetings provided

01:22:12.828 --> 01:22:15.397 region:rollup2
learning opportunities for all

01:22:14.963 --> 01:22:17.065 region:rollup2
members food at all

01:22:15.397 --> 01:22:18.867 region:rollup2
professionals became what

01:22:17.065 --> 01:22:19.435 region:rollup2
capable. Of.

01:22:18.867 --> 01:22:20.869 region:rollup2
Handling human trafficking

01:22:19.435 --> 01:22:23.105 region:rollup2
cases.

01:22:20.869 --> 01:22:24.940 region:rollup2
I want to just briefly talk

01:22:23.105 --> 01:22:25.541 region:rollup2
about barriers that I want to

01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:26.875 region:rollup2
spend too much time about it

01:22:25.541 --> 01:22:27.509 region:rollup2
because that there we are talk

01:22:26.875 --> 01:22:28.911 region:rollup2
about. The lack of housing the

01:22:27.509 --> 01:22:30.913 region:rollup2
for sure.

01:22:28.911 --> 01:22:32.881 region:rollup2
As they can use I think.

01:22:30.913 --> 01:22:33.515 region:rollup2
We are not quite quite

01:22:32.881 --> 01:22:34.883 region:rollup2
identifying male victims of UN

01:22:33.515 --> 01:22:36.919 region:rollup2
traffic

01:22:34.883 --> 01:22:37.586 region:rollup2
we are not as good at that so we

01:22:36.919 --> 01:22:39.188 region:rollup2
need more education are on that

01:22:37.586 --> 01:22:40.889 region:rollup2
and we need more commitment to

01:22:39.188 --> 01:22:42.925 region:rollup2
the identifying male becomes.

01:22:40.889 --> 01:22:44.893 region:rollup2
And also labor trafficking I

01:22:42.925 --> 01:22:47.129 region:rollup2
think we are definitely not.

01:22:44.893 --> 01:22:49.097 region:rollup2
As good about identify labor

01:22:47.129 --> 01:22:50.899 region:rollup2
choppy becomes and providing

01:22:49.097 --> 01:22:51.166 region:rollup2
services to them.

01:22:50.899 --> 01:22:53.068 region:rollup2
Princess.

01:22:51.166 --> 01:22:54.870 region:rollup2
The coalition are has produced

01:22:53.068 --> 01:22:57.005 region:rollup2
the reports I'm gonna leave this

01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:58.941 region:rollup2
to use him so you could read

01:22:57.005 --> 01:22:59.575 region:rollup2
them in your spare time.

01:22:58.941 --> 01:23:01.243 region:rollup2
So the coalition's report also

01:22:59.575 --> 01:23:03.145 region:rollup2
identifies some of the cases

01:23:01.243 --> 01:23:05.214 region:rollup2
that we worked on as a coalition

01:23:03.145 --> 01:23:07.149 region:rollup2
of oda partners. And in a in

01:23:05.214 --> 01:23:07.583 region:rollup2
Contra Costa county the

01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:09.384 region:rollup2
coalition members.

01:23:07.583 --> 01:23:11.253 region:rollup2
Provided services to five

01:23:09.384 --> 01:23:13.222 region:rollup2
hundred victims between two

01:23:11.253 --> 01:23:13.655 region:rollup2
thousand fourteen and two

01:23:13.222 --> 01:23:15.357 region:rollup2
thousand seventeen.

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:16.959 region:rollup2
And ninety percent of those

01:23:15.357 --> 01:23:19.294 region:rollup2
victims will women.

01:23:16.959 --> 01:23:21.129 region:rollup2
And also labor chucking it was

01:23:19.294 --> 01:23:21.597 region:rollup2
about ten percent. We believe

01:23:21.129 --> 01:23:23.265 region:rollup2
that their much labor

01:23:21.597 --> 01:23:25.234 region:rollup2
trafficking cases out there we

01:23:23.265 --> 01:23:27.269 region:rollup2
just are not addressing them

01:23:25.234 --> 01:23:28.971 region:rollup2
adequately someone I give you

01:23:27.269 --> 01:23:31.173 region:rollup2
this reports.

01:23:28.971 --> 01:23:33.008 region:rollup2
Up in terms of the additional

01:23:31.173 --> 01:23:35.110 region:rollup2
resources that we need.

01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:35.744 region:rollup2
I wanna go back to more

01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:37.012 region:rollup2
training and resources for labor

01:23:35.744 --> 01:23:39.348 region:rollup2
trafficking.

01:23:37.012 --> 01:23:41.283 region:rollup2
And then one of collaboration

01:23:39.348 --> 01:23:43.151 region:rollup2
across sectors and departments

01:23:41.283 --> 01:23:44.600 region:rollup2
and different.

01:23:43.151 --> 01:23:44.600 region:rollup2
Sectors I think up Nancy

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:48.900 region:rollup2
o'malley Maienschein.

01:23:48.957 --> 01:23:51.393 region:rollup2
systems I think that's really

01:23:49.591 --> 01:23:52.995 region:rollup2
important. I also like the idea

01:23:51.393 --> 01:23:54.963 region:rollup2
of how to Palos.

01:23:52.995 --> 01:23:56.999 region:rollup2
A when I was sitting here today

01:23:54.963 --> 01:23:57.633 region:rollup2
actually I got an email from.

01:23:56.999 --> 01:23:58.967 region:rollup2
Someone with them mount Diablo

01:23:57.633 --> 01:24:01.270 region:rollup2
school district

01:23:58.967 --> 01:24:01.637 region:rollup2
and I was like how timely I too

01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:02.938 region:rollup2
got this email.

01:24:01.637 --> 01:24:05.407 region:rollup2
What they're saying is?

01:24:02.938 --> 01:24:07.209 region:rollup2
Mount double unified school

01:24:05.407 --> 01:24:09.077 region:rollup2
district has been struggling

01:24:07.209 --> 01:24:09.645 region:rollup2
with so many young girls and

01:24:09.077 --> 01:24:11.046 region:rollup2
boys who are being sexually

01:24:09.645 --> 01:24:13.015 region:rollup2
exploited.

01:24:11.046 --> 01:24:15.050 region:rollup2
Then or at high risk

01:24:13.015 --> 01:24:15.684 region:rollup2
the day identified that and they

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:17.386 region:rollup2
wanna do something about it in

01:24:15.684 --> 01:24:19.187 region:rollup2
the school district and they've

01:24:17.386 --> 01:24:19.655 region:rollup2
reached out to us the family

justice center and the

01:24:19.655 --> 01:24:21.556 region:rollup2
coalition.

01:24:20.923 --> 01:24:23.125 region:rollup2
To work together you know we

01:24:21.556 --> 01:24:23.759 region:rollup2
have this collaboration

01:24:23.125 --> 01:24:25.294 region:rollup2
opportunities that I would be

01:24:23.759 --> 01:24:27.095 region:rollup2
point so I went over to talk

01:24:25.294 --> 01:24:28.897 region:rollup2
about that expanding those

01:24:27.095 --> 01:24:31.166 region:rollup2
resources to improve

01:24:28.897 --> 01:24:33.302 region:rollup2
collaboration. Among different

01:24:31.166 --> 01:24:35.037 region:rollup2
sectors through that we've done

01:24:33.302 --> 01:24:35.604 region:rollup2
work in silos.

01:24:35.037 --> 01:24:36.038 region:rollup2
And then I just wanna also

01:24:35.604 --> 01:24:37.372 region:rollup2
mentioned that.

01:24:36.038 --> 01:24:38.974 region:rollup2
We need to look up pay

01:24:37.372 --> 01:24:39.541 region:rollup2

01:24:58.961 --> 01:25:01.396 region:rollup2
this last year. So what are we

01:24:59.595 --> 01:25:03.198 region:rollup2

who spoken today so eloquently

01:25:51.246 --> 01:25:55.050 region:rollup2
about the needs of our human

01:25:53.215 --> 01:25:55.684 region:rollup2
trafficking victims. I don't

01:25:55.050 --> 01:25:57.519 region:rollup2
feel like I need to spend that

01:25:55.684 --> 01:25:59.254 region:rollup2
much time even going over all of

01:25:57.519 --> 01:25:59.855 region:rollup2
the. Different areas that I

01:25:59.254 --> 01:26:01.490 region:rollup2
could have potentially done

01:25:59.855 --> 01:26:03.058 region:rollup2
because the palace have been so

01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:05.427 region:rollup2
thorough in their comments.

01:26:03.058 --> 01:26:05.994 region:rollup2
And one of the things I wanted

01:26:05.427 --> 01:26:07.396 region:rollup2
states it's actually very

01:26:05.994 --> 01:26:09.331 region:rollup2
inspiring and heart warming to

01:26:07.396 --> 01:26:11.133 region:rollup2
know that. There's so much

01:26:09.331 --> 01:26:13.201 region:rollup2
expertise out there because when

01:26:11.133 --> 01:26:13.402 region:rollup2
you're doing this work it feels

01:26:13.201 --> 01:26:17.105 region:rollup2
very.

01:26:13.402 --> 01:26:17.639 region:rollup2
Overwhelming and it feels like.

01:26:17.105 --> 01:26:19.408 region:rollup2
We're not gonna make any

01:26:17.639 --> 01:26:21.443 region:rollup2
difference so it felt really

01:26:19.408 --> 01:26:23.545 region:rollup2
good to me to hear how much.

01:26:21.443 --> 01:26:25.480 region:rollup2
Expertise is out there and

01:26:23.545 --> 01:26:27.616 region:rollup2
obviously the expertise leads us

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:29.351 region:rollup2
to what more is needed but at

01:26:27.616 --> 01:26:31.119 region:rollup2
least were were more aware of

01:26:29.351 --> 01:26:33.188 region:rollup2
what that challenges our.

01:26:31.119 --> 01:26:35.290 region:rollup2
I'm a division manager with

01:26:33.188 --> 01:26:37.125 region:rollup2
children and family services in

01:26:35.290 --> 01:26:39.194 region:rollup2
Contra Costa county. And.

01:26:37.125 --> 01:26:41.096 region:rollup2
For the last several years I've

01:26:39.194 --> 01:26:41.730 region:rollup2
been tasked with implementing

01:26:41.096 --> 01:26:43.432 region:rollup2
the cease act program which is

01:26:41.730 --> 01:26:45.367 region:rollup2
commercially sexually exploited

01:26:43.432 --> 01:26:47.235 region:rollup2
children program. In our county

01:26:45.367 --> 01:26:49.304 region:rollup2
which went into effect in two

01:26:47.235 --> 01:26:53.175 region:rollup2
thousand fifteen with the

01:26:49.304 --> 01:26:55.143 region:rollup2
passage of SB eight fifty five.

01:26:53.175 --> 01:26:55.343 region:rollup2
S. B. fit a fifty five clarified

01:26:55.143 --> 01:26:59.147 region:rollup2
that.

01:26:55.343 --> 01:26:59.748 region:rollup2
Children who've been exploited

01:26:59.147 --> 01:27:01.450 region:rollup2
could be served by the child

01:26:59.748 --> 01:27:03.218 region:rollup2
welfare system although we had

01:27:01.450 --> 01:27:05.153 region:rollup2
always been in.

01:27:03.218 --> 01:27:07.389 region:rollup2
Working with youth who been.

01:27:05.153 --> 01:27:09.458 region:rollup2
Traffic or had been exploited

01:27:07.389 --> 01:27:13.128 region:rollup2
it clarified that the children

01:27:09.458 --> 01:27:13.762 region:rollup2
are actually victims and as such

01:27:13.128 --> 01:27:15.597 region:rollup2
should be reported to our child

01:27:13.762 --> 01:27:17.666 region:rollup2
abuse prevention hotline so one

01:27:15.597 --> 01:27:19.468 region:rollup2
of the things that S. B. eight

01:27:17.666 --> 01:27:21.169 region:rollup2
fifty five did it clarified that

01:27:19.468 --> 01:27:25.173 region:rollup2
all.

01:27:21.169 --> 01:27:25.807 region:rollup2
Suspicion of exploitation and

01:27:25.173 --> 01:27:27.476 region:rollup2
trafficking whether or not the

01:27:25.807 --> 01:27:29.511 region:rollup2
parent was aware or did

01:27:27.476 --> 01:27:31.546 region:rollup2
something to I'm contributed

01:27:29.511 --> 01:27:33.615 region:rollup2
exploitation it should still be

01:27:31.546 --> 01:27:35.650 region:rollup2
reported to our hotline and that

01:27:33.615 --> 01:27:37.219 region:rollup2
we were also tasked with cross

01:27:35.650 --> 01:27:39.154 region:rollup2
reporting back to law

01:27:37.219 --> 01:27:39.688 region:rollup2
enforcement. So those were some

01:27:39.154 --> 01:27:41.189 region:rollup2
of the changes that that

01:27:39.688 --> 01:27:43.558 region:rollup2
legislature.

01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:45.293 region:rollup2
A courage my comments today are

01:27:43.558 --> 01:27:47.262 region:rollup2
going to address the issues

01:27:45.293 --> 01:27:49.364 region:rollup2
facing our counties human

01:27:47.262 --> 01:27:49.965 region:rollup2
trafficking coalition pursue son

01:27:49.364 --> 01:27:51.633 region:rollup2
covered a lot of that. So I'm

01:27:49.965 --> 01:27:53.635 region:rollup2
gonna focus more specifically on

01:27:51.633 --> 01:27:55.570 region:rollup2
some of the challenges that face

01:27:53.635 --> 01:27:57.672 region:rollup2
youth and families who are

01:27:55.570 --> 01:28:01.276 region:rollup2
served or on coming contact with

01:27:57.672 --> 01:28:01.943 region:rollup2
the child welfare system.

01:28:01.276 --> 01:28:03.512 region:rollup2
We do participate from the very

01:28:01.943 --> 01:28:05.280 region:rollup2
beginning when I got involved

01:28:03.512 --> 01:28:07.415 region:rollup2
with.

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:09.217 region:rollup2
This work I partner with the

01:28:07.415 --> 01:28:11.453 region:rollup2
human trafficking coalition

01:28:09.217 --> 01:28:13.655 region:rollup2
because. It's up such complex

01:28:11.453 --> 01:28:17.225 region:rollup2
work on any. It they require

01:28:13.655 --> 01:28:17.826 region:rollup2
such capacity in the community

01:28:17.225 --> 01:28:19.528 region:rollup2
that it made more sense to be

01:28:17.826 --> 01:28:19.794 region:rollup2
involved with the greater

01:28:19.528 --> 01:28:21.730 region:rollup2
counties.

01:28:19.794 --> 01:28:23.398 region:rollup2
Activities so that we could

01:28:21.730 --> 01:28:25.233 region:rollup2
leverage our resources leverage

01:28:23.398 --> 01:28:27.369 region:rollup2
our expertise

01:28:25.233 --> 01:28:29.271 region:rollup2
and be more aware of what is out

01:28:27.369 --> 01:28:31.273 region:rollup2
there what the gaps are.

01:28:29.271 --> 01:28:33.341 region:rollup2
Through the legislation as I

01:28:31.273 --> 01:28:35.377 region:rollup2
mentioned we're tasked with the

01:28:33.341 --> 01:28:37.579 region:rollup2
requirement to identify. And

01:28:35.377 --> 01:28:37.846 region:rollup2
track in our child welfare

01:28:37.579 --> 01:28:41.316 region:rollup2
database.

01:28:37.846 --> 01:28:41.750 region:rollup2
It's that's a statewide system.

01:28:41.316 --> 01:28:43.285 region:rollup2
You that have been.

01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:45.253 region:rollup2
.

01:28:43.285 --> 01:28:47.255 region:rollup2
Traffic it's either before

01:28:45.253 --> 01:28:47.923 region:rollup2
coming into foster care after

01:28:47.255 --> 01:28:49.658 region:rollup2
being in foster care and also

01:28:47.923 --> 01:28:51.693 region:rollup2
tracking those who are at risk

01:28:49.658 --> 01:28:53.461 region:rollup2
so a lot of our efforts are

01:28:51.693 --> 01:28:55.263 region:rollup2
around training our social

01:28:53.461 --> 01:28:57.299 region:rollup2
workers and our community

01:28:55.263 --> 01:28:59.301 region:rollup2
partners. Around identification.

01:28:57.299 --> 01:29:01.403 region:rollup2
We also serve.

01:28:59.301 --> 01:29:03.605 region:rollup2
Youth and families we provide

01:29:01.403 --> 01:29:05.407 region:rollup2
case management we provide place

01:29:03.605 --> 01:29:07.442 region:rollup2
that resources if they come into

01:29:05.407 --> 01:29:09.544 region:rollup2
foster care. And we also provide

01:29:07.442 --> 01:29:11.213 region:rollup2
service linkage to our community

01:29:09.544 --> 01:29:13.381 region:rollup2
partners we don't specifically

01:29:11.213 --> 01:29:13.915 region:rollup2
provides a mental services but

01:29:13.381 --> 01:29:15.584 region:rollup2
we work with our kids.

01:29:13.915 --> 01:29:17.352 region:rollup2
County mental health or

01:29:15.584 --> 01:29:19.387 region:rollup2
community based organizations to

01:29:17.352 --> 01:29:21.656 region:rollup2
ensure that families you get.

01:29:19.387 --> 01:29:23.391 region:rollup2
Link dot and then one of our

01:29:21.656 --> 01:29:23.992 region:rollup2
primary goals is obviously we

01:29:23.391 --> 01:29:25.794 region:rollup2
unification R. permanency for

01:29:23.992 --> 01:29:27.729 region:rollup2
you. Making sure that they're

01:29:25.794 --> 01:29:29.664 region:rollup2
able to move back home to a safe

01:29:27.729 --> 01:29:31.366 region:rollup2
home or and to some other

01:29:29.664 --> 01:29:33.735 region:rollup2
permanent situation.

01:29:31.366 --> 01:29:35.470 region:rollup2
I'm one of the areas that limits

01:29:33.735 --> 01:29:37.772 region:rollup2
our ability to serve these.

01:29:35.470 --> 01:29:39.774 region:rollup2
Victims is actually they use

01:29:37.772 --> 01:29:43.378 region:rollup2
receptive eighty to services.

01:29:39.774 --> 01:29:44.045 region:rollup2
As many of us learned through

01:29:43.378 --> 01:29:47.415 region:rollup2
training that there's aye stages

01:29:44.045 --> 01:29:49.351 region:rollup2
of change that occur for.

01:29:47.415 --> 01:29:50.018 region:rollup2
For anyone who's going through

01:29:49.351 --> 01:29:51.820 region:rollup2
any challenge in their life and

01:29:50.018 --> 01:29:53.822 region:rollup2
a lot of that you that we had.

01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:55.757 region:rollup2
Come across are just not even

01:29:53.822 --> 01:29:57.826 region:rollup2
aware were ready to make a

01:29:55.757 --> 01:29:59.761 region:rollup2
change and so how that manifests

01:29:57.826 --> 01:30:01.630 region:rollup2
is that they're often. Be very

01:29:59.761 --> 01:30:03.498 region:rollup2
difficult to work with.

01:30:01.630 --> 01:30:05.734 region:rollup2
They're teenagers on there are

01:30:03.498 --> 01:30:07.669 region:rollup2
resistant to aye acknowledging

01:30:05.734 --> 01:30:09.371 region:rollup2
that there's a problem they run

01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:11.773 region:rollup2
away a lot the.

01:30:09.371 --> 01:30:13.541 region:rollup2
They coming go it's very

01:30:11.773 --> 01:30:15.610 region:rollup2
challenging and it's very

01:30:13.541 --> 01:30:17.545 region:rollup2
frustrating for those that want

01:30:15.610 --> 01:30:19.347 region:rollup2
to help that we all want to go

01:30:17.545 --> 01:30:21.549 region:rollup2
out and rescue these.

01:30:19.347 --> 01:30:23.351 region:rollup2
Victims but the reality is they

01:30:21.549 --> 01:30:25.320 region:rollup2
have to have some willingness to

01:30:23.351 --> 01:30:27.489 region:rollup2
change or receive the.

01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:31.293 region:rollup2
Of the assistance and then of

01:30:27.489 --> 01:30:31.726 region:rollup2
course as a child welfare agency

01:30:31.293 --> 01:30:33.662 region:rollup2
and also for.

01:30:31.726 --> 01:30:34.329 region:rollup2
Approach our probation partners

01:30:33.662 --> 01:30:35.563 region:rollup2
who are charged with making up

01:30:34.329 --> 01:30:37.532 region:rollup2
placement into foster care

01:30:35.563 --> 01:30:39.567 region:rollup2
within challenged with them

01:30:37.532 --> 01:30:39.768 region:rollup2
coming and going out of foster

01:30:39.567 --> 01:30:41.770 region:rollup2
care.

01:30:39.768 --> 01:30:43.505 region:rollup2
Taking use with them out back

01:30:41.770 --> 01:30:45.407 region:rollup2
on to the streets getting

01:30:43.505 --> 01:30:49.411 region:rollup2
exploited and foster care.

01:30:45.407 --> 01:30:50.011 region:rollup2
And just that challenge of.

01:30:49.411 --> 01:30:53.415 region:rollup2
Of care givers whether it's

01:30:50.011 --> 01:30:53.848 region:rollup2
relatives or foster homes or a

01:30:53.415 --> 01:30:55.750 region:rollup2
larger facilities.

01:30:53.848 --> 01:30:57.385 region:rollup2
Group homes having the.

01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:59.688 region:rollup2
.

01:30:57.385 --> 01:31:01.556 region:rollup2
The ability and willingness to

01:30:59.688 --> 01:31:03.925 region:rollup2
deal with layers of trauma.

01:31:01.556 --> 01:31:05.393 region:rollup2
On the youth that are coming to

01:31:03.925 --> 01:31:07.462 region:rollup2
us.

01:31:05.393 --> 01:31:08.063 region:rollup2
It's no it's no accident that

01:31:07.462 --> 01:31:11.366 region:rollup2
they're being exploited these

01:31:08.063 --> 01:31:13.368 region:rollup2
are usually I use that have been

01:31:11.366 --> 01:31:13.935 region:rollup2
abused as young children weather

01:31:13.368 --> 01:31:15.837 region:rollup2
was severely lacks. Physical

01:31:13.935 --> 01:31:17.672 region:rollup2
abuse sexual abuse their coming

01:31:15.837 --> 01:31:19.474 region:rollup2
with layers and layers and

01:31:17.672 --> 01:31:20.075 region:rollup2
layers of trauma exposure to

01:31:19.474 --> 01:31:23.445 region:rollup2
violence in their communities

01:31:20.075 --> 01:31:25.714 region:rollup2
are their homes so it's not.

01:31:23.445 --> 01:31:27.482 region:rollup2
Easy to take these youth into

01:31:25.714 --> 01:31:29.417 region:rollup2
your home and for those of you

01:31:27.482 --> 01:31:31.519 region:rollup2
like myself who have teenagers.

01:31:29.417 --> 01:31:33.488 region:rollup2
It's just not even easy they're

01:31:31.519 --> 01:31:35.557 region:rollup2
teenagers they're putting up.

01:31:33.488 --> 01:31:37.425 region:rollup2
Up beside and I shall a way of

01:31:35.557 --> 01:31:39.594 region:rollup2
being they want to be.

01:31:37.425 --> 01:31:40.228 region:rollup2
Adults in some ways so it just

01:31:39.594 --> 01:31:41.429 region:rollup2
makes it really challenging to

01:31:40.228 --> 01:31:43.832 region:rollup2
work with them.

01:31:41.429 --> 01:31:45.667 region:rollup2
At another barrier for child

01:31:43.832 --> 01:31:47.602 region:rollup2
welfare for probation a

01:31:45.667 --> 01:31:49.704 region:rollup2
particular who do try to make

01:31:47.602 --> 01:31:51.506 region:rollup2
placements into the facilities

01:31:49.704 --> 01:31:51.706 region:rollup2
that we have in California. Is

01:31:51.506 --> 01:31:55.543 region:rollup2
that.

01:31:51.706 --> 01:31:57.479 region:rollup2
The regulations that. We.

01:31:55.543 --> 01:31:59.748 region:rollup2
We are.

01:31:57.479 --> 01:32:01.783 region:rollup2
Passed with where we're governed

01:31:59.748 --> 01:32:03.718 region:rollup2
by the state by federal ready

01:32:01.783 --> 01:32:05.620 region:rollup2
regulation state regulations and

01:32:03.718 --> 01:32:07.589 region:rollup2
it makes it difficult for us to

01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:09.457 region:rollup2
navigate a system. And is to

01:32:07.589 --> 01:32:11.493 region:rollup2
make placements into foster care

01:32:09.457 --> 01:32:12.060 region:rollup2
our server use when we have to.

01:32:11.493 --> 01:32:13.695 region:rollup2
Among or working with our

01:32:12.060 --> 01:32:15.730 region:rollup2
juvenile courts all the youth

01:32:13.695 --> 01:32:16.030 region:rollup2
have attorneys families have

01:32:15.730 --> 01:32:17.899 region:rollup2
attorneys.

01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:19.701 region:rollup2
And it's just makes it

01:32:17.899 --> 01:32:21.703 region:rollup2
complicated it's not as simple

01:32:19.701 --> 01:32:23.671 region:rollup2
as just placing a youth in a

01:32:21.703 --> 01:32:25.607 region:rollup2
home in a. Rural area and just

01:32:23.671 --> 01:32:25.807 region:rollup2
letting it go it's it's very

01:32:25.607 --> 01:32:27.876 region:rollup2
calm.

01:32:25.807 --> 01:32:29.577 region:rollup2
Complicated is really hard to

01:32:27.876 --> 01:32:29.878 region:rollup2
juggle when you're managing so

01:32:29.577 --> 01:32:31.546 region:rollup2
many other.

01:32:29.878 --> 01:32:31.813 region:rollup2
.

01:32:31.546 --> 01:32:33.548 region:rollup2
Caseload.

01:32:31.813 --> 01:32:35.850 region:rollup2
.

01:32:33.548 --> 01:32:37.752 region:rollup2
Demands other initiatives are

01:32:35.850 --> 01:32:38.386 region:rollup2
coming down or new changes in

01:32:37.752 --> 01:32:39.521 region:rollup2
law that our staff have to deal

01:32:38.386 --> 01:32:41.923 region:rollup2
with.

01:32:39.521 --> 01:32:43.725 region:rollup2
Some of the resources that we've

01:32:41.923 --> 01:32:45.527 region:rollup2
identified include like I said

01:32:43.725 --> 01:32:47.695 region:rollup2
placer resources.

01:32:45.527 --> 01:32:49.831 region:rollup2
The ability to and the

01:32:47.695 --> 01:32:51.633 region:rollup2
willingness to serve teenagers

01:32:49.831 --> 01:32:53.535 region:rollup2
are young.

01:32:51.633 --> 01:32:55.937 region:rollup2
Young young children.

01:32:53.535 --> 01:32:58.039 region:rollup2
And how that specialty we there

01:32:55.937 --> 01:33:01.576 region:rollup2
is training out there now from

01:32:58.039 --> 01:33:02.077 region:rollup2
on the community colleges who.

01:33:01.576 --> 01:33:03.945 region:rollup2
Provide curriculum for

01:33:02.077 --> 01:33:06.047 region:rollup2
caregivers but it's not mandated

01:33:03.945 --> 01:33:07.916 region:rollup2
it. Mandated that the community

01:33:06.047 --> 01:33:09.884 region:rollup2
colleges provide that for our

01:33:07.916 --> 01:33:11.519 region:rollup2
child welfare families but

01:33:09.884 --> 01:33:12.187 region:rollup2
they're not.

01:33:11.519 --> 01:33:13.922 region:rollup2
Foster families but they're not

01:33:12.187 --> 01:33:15.557 region:rollup2
required to go because there's

01:33:13.922 --> 01:33:16.224 region:rollup2
so many other reasons.

01:33:15.557 --> 01:33:16.624 region:rollup2
Other training that they need to

01:33:16.224 --> 01:33:19.561 region:rollup2
do so training on

01:33:16.624 --> 01:33:19.761 region:rollup2
identification.

01:33:19.561 --> 01:33:21.963 region:rollup2
And.

01:33:19.761 --> 01:33:23.932 region:rollup2
Just out like I had said earlier

01:33:21.963 --> 01:33:26.034 region:rollup2
just being able to emotionally

01:33:23.932 --> 01:33:27.936 region:rollup2
deal with the layers of trauma

01:33:26.034 --> 01:33:29.838 region:rollup2
and the fact that you were

01:33:27.936 --> 01:33:31.639 region:rollup2
opening your home. To potential

01:33:29.838 --> 01:33:33.675 region:rollup2
violence and.

01:33:31.639 --> 01:33:34.242 region:rollup2
If especially if exploiters are

01:33:33.675 --> 01:33:35.643 region:rollup2
still out there. We have and

01:33:34.242 --> 01:33:37.645 region:rollup2
the.

01:33:35.643 --> 01:33:38.213 region:rollup2
Youth and foster care are.

01:33:37.645 --> 01:33:40.014 region:rollup2
Allowed to have a set of

01:33:38.213 --> 01:33:41.783 region:rollup2
personal rights which were very

01:33:40.014 --> 01:33:42.417 region:rollup2
important and those personal

01:33:41.783 --> 01:33:44.018 region:rollup2
rights though sometimes conflict

01:33:42.417 --> 01:33:45.887 region:rollup2
with our desire to keep them

01:33:44.018 --> 01:33:47.889 region:rollup2
safe so often they're. Able to

01:33:45.887 --> 01:33:49.791 region:rollup2
have cell phones we can't take

01:33:47.889 --> 01:33:51.793 region:rollup2
cellphones away and that's

01:33:49.791 --> 01:33:53.761 region:rollup2
obviously. As Louise pointed out

01:33:51.793 --> 01:33:54.229 region:rollup2
social media as a is a huge way

01:33:53.761 --> 01:33:55.630 region:rollup2
that they're getting.

01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:57.665 region:rollup2
.

01:33:55.630 --> 01:33:59.667 region:rollup2
Contacted or exploited or

01:33:57.665 --> 01:34:00.335 region:rollup2
recruited of what have you so we

01:33:59.667 --> 01:34:01.936 region:rollup2
we have some challenges I know

01:34:00.335 --> 01:34:04.072 region:rollup2
there's reform going on in our

01:34:01.936 --> 01:34:05.907 region:rollup2
system but it's it's it's hard

01:34:04.072 --> 01:34:08.042 region:rollup2
to balance both.

01:34:05.907 --> 01:34:09.577 region:rollup2
The other thing that I think

01:34:08.042 --> 01:34:11.679 region:rollup2
that.

01:34:09.577 --> 01:34:12.313 region:rollup2
We've identified in this is

01:34:11.679 --> 01:34:13.748 region:rollup2
been something for a long time

01:34:12.313 --> 01:34:15.783 region:rollup2
and manage the.

01:34:13.748 --> 01:34:17.886 region:rollup2
Art hotline for many years and

01:34:15.783 --> 01:34:18.520 region:rollup2
I'm the the social workers that

01:34:17.886 --> 01:34:19.988 region:rollup2
manage hotline when I would ask

01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:21.689 region:rollup2
them what is the biggest thing

01:34:19.988 --> 01:34:22.323 region:rollup2
that you're seeing. You know

01:34:21.689 --> 01:34:25.693 region:rollup2
need that you see out there and

01:34:22.323 --> 01:34:27.629 region:rollup2
it's resources and support for

01:34:25.693 --> 01:34:29.764 region:rollup2
families with teenagers with

01:34:27.629 --> 01:34:31.699 region:rollup2
adolescents and I think that

01:34:29.764 --> 01:34:33.535 region:rollup2
that was even before we identify

01:34:31.699 --> 01:34:35.537 region:rollup2
that that see sec was occurring

01:34:33.535 --> 01:34:36.037 region:rollup2
at such a volume. But really

01:34:35.537 --> 01:34:37.906 region:rollup2
these are families were

01:34:36.037 --> 01:34:39.774 region:rollup2
struggling with young adults

01:34:37.906 --> 01:34:41.809 region:rollup2
with their teenagers and there's

01:34:39.774 --> 01:34:42.010 region:rollup2
nothing in the community toward

01:34:41.809 --> 01:34:43.845 region:rollup2
them.

01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:45.613 region:rollup2
You're limited by what health

01:34:43.845 --> 01:34:47.582 region:rollup2
insurance you have.

01:34:45.613 --> 01:34:47.982 region:rollup2
And that may or may not be

01:34:47.582 --> 01:34:50.084 region:rollup2
holistic enough.

01:34:47.982 --> 01:34:52.120 region:rollup2
So resources around if you're

01:34:50.084 --> 01:34:53.955 region:rollup2
just someone in the community

01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:54.155 region:rollup2
you need help parenting your

01:34:53.955 --> 01:34:56.024 region:rollup2
team.

01:34:54.155 --> 01:34:57.692 region:rollup2
What's out there in the

01:34:56.024 --> 01:34:59.661 region:rollup2
community and.

01:34:57.692 --> 01:35:01.729 region:rollup2
Being able to serve them and

01:34:59.661 --> 01:35:03.631 region:rollup2
then once they do become clients

01:35:01.729 --> 01:35:05.700 region:rollup2
of child welfare.

01:35:03.631 --> 01:35:08.002 region:rollup2
It it is still just as

01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:08.303 region:rollup2
challenging to find resources to

01:35:08.002 --> 01:35:08.870 region:rollup2
serve them.

01:35:08.303 --> 01:35:09.971 region:rollup2
So finally I just want to

01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:12.106 region:rollup2
encourage the legislature to

01:35:09.971 --> 01:35:15.677 region:rollup2
trust that the greater societal

01:35:12.106 --> 01:35:16.344 region:rollup2
issue of child sexual abuse and.

01:35:15.677 --> 01:35:17.679 region:rollup2
Happy that other isn't mentioned

01:35:16.344 --> 01:35:18.313 region:rollup2
this.

01:35:17.679 --> 01:35:21.649 region:rollup2
We really need to get at the

01:35:18.313 --> 01:35:23.618 region:rollup2
heart of why it's okay for

01:35:21.649 --> 01:35:24.252 region:rollup2
adults to have sex with children

01:35:23.618 --> 01:35:25.987 region:rollup2
every that's a societal issue

01:35:24.252 --> 01:35:26.487 region:rollup2
that's not something that's how

01:35:25.987 --> 01:35:29.724 region:rollup2
welfare can solve we're

01:35:26.487 --> 01:35:31.626 region:rollup2
basically. Up receiving kids

01:35:29.724 --> 01:35:33.628 region:rollup2
who've Bates who. You know have

01:35:31.626 --> 01:35:35.630 region:rollup2
had years of neglect and abuse

01:35:33.628 --> 01:35:37.665 region:rollup2
and it cut it starts with some

01:35:35.630 --> 01:35:38.299 region:rollup2
fundamental issues that.

01:35:37.665 --> 01:35:40.001 region:rollup2
We're not dealing with in our

01:35:38.299 --> 01:35:41.669 region:rollup2
society which is why is that

01:35:40.001 --> 01:35:42.303 region:rollup2
okay.

01:35:41.669 --> 01:35:44.038 region:rollup2
Why is that okay and so one of

01:35:42.303 --> 01:35:46.040 region:rollup2
the things I would encourage is

01:35:44.038 --> 01:35:47.775 region:rollup2
we have partners around the

01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:49.877 region:rollup2
state who do child abuse

01:35:47.775 --> 01:35:50.445 region:rollup2
prevention? Education and that's

01:35:49.877 --> 01:35:51.980 region:rollup2
our child abuse prevention

01:35:50.445 --> 01:35:55.717 region:rollup2
councils their woefully.

01:35:51.980 --> 01:35:57.652 region:rollup2
Under under funded.

01:35:55.717 --> 01:35:58.286 region:rollup2
But there are like our own

01:35:57.652 --> 01:36:00.054 region:rollup2
child abuse prevention council

01:35:58.286 --> 01:36:01.956 region:rollup2
is out there doing curriculum

01:36:00.054 --> 01:36:03.825 region:rollup2
and and school districts they've

01:36:01.956 --> 01:36:04.359 region:rollup2
been views some of the

01:36:03.825 --> 01:36:05.893 region:rollup2
trafficking information in

01:36:04.359 --> 01:36:06.561 region:rollup2
there.

01:36:05.893 --> 01:36:07.996 region:rollup2
But they're they they need more

01:36:06.561 --> 01:36:10.098 region:rollup2
resources to expand into

01:36:07.996 --> 01:36:12.100 region:rollup2
dedicated curriculum for school

01:36:10.098 --> 01:36:14.135 region:rollup2
districts and I'm sure other on

01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:14.469 region:rollup2
child abuse prevention councils

01:36:14.135 --> 01:36:15.737 region:rollup2
with it well.

01:36:14.469 --> 01:36:16.371 region:rollup2
Thank you very much.

01:36:15.737 --> 01:36:19.774 region:rollup2
Thank you so very much for your

01:36:16.371 --> 01:36:21.743 region:rollup2
presentation.

01:36:19.774 --> 01:36:22.076 region:rollup2
And we will move on to Benicia

01:36:21.743 --> 01:36:23.778 region:rollup2
Johnson and.

01:36:22.076 --> 01:36:27.782 region:rollup2
.

01:36:23.778 --> 01:36:29.751 region:rollup2
Get away.

01:36:27.782 --> 01:36:31.719 region:rollup2
There was.

01:36:29.751 --> 01:36:32.253 region:rollup2
Thank you chairman Grayson and

01:36:31.719 --> 01:36:35.857 region:rollup2
everyone for being here.

01:36:32.253 --> 01:36:36.257 region:rollup2
I have aye specific role I work

01:36:35.857 --> 01:36:38.293 region:rollup2
primarily with.

01:36:36.257 --> 01:36:40.128 region:rollup2
Children who've been sexually

01:36:38.293 --> 01:36:42.163 region:rollup2
exploited within the county so

01:36:40.128 --> 01:36:43.931 region:rollup2
I've only been here a few months

01:36:42.163 --> 01:36:45.800 region:rollup2
so in so many ways I think and

01:36:43.931 --> 01:36:46.100 region:rollup2
stone the preparation phase. So

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:47.869 region:rollup2
hopefully.

01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:48.469 region:rollup2
I'm able to articulate myself

01:36:47.869 --> 01:36:51.806 region:rollup2
while as my boss sits next to

01:36:48.469 --> 01:36:52.273 region:rollup2
me.

01:36:51.806 --> 01:36:55.977 region:rollup2
Thank you for that.

01:36:52.273 --> 01:36:56.511 region:rollup2
I think my role has always been

01:36:55.977 --> 01:36:58.179 region:rollup2
a little bit different I.

01:36:56.511 --> 01:37:00.181 region:rollup2
I came introduced to sexual

01:36:58.179 --> 01:37:02.083 region:rollup2
exploited kids when I was twenty

01:37:00.181 --> 01:37:04.152 region:rollup2
years old. And my first clients

01:37:02.083 --> 01:37:05.887 region:rollup2
in liberty city Miami Y. has an

01:37:04.152 --> 01:37:08.089 region:rollup2
eighth grade.

01:37:05.887 --> 01:37:10.091 region:rollup2
Young man who was selling and

01:37:08.089 --> 01:37:12.193 region:rollup2
himself at night and he would

01:37:10.091 --> 01:37:13.995 region:rollup2
show out only on the days that

01:37:12.193 --> 01:37:15.663 region:rollup2
we had out there. And he would

01:37:13.995 --> 01:37:17.765 region:rollup2
talk to me about those

01:37:15.663 --> 01:37:18.366 region:rollup2
experiences so at that time

01:37:17.765 --> 01:37:20.234 region:rollup2
there were that dilutes the

01:37:18.366 --> 01:37:22.136 region:rollup2
lingo wasn't even around and the

01:37:20.234 --> 01:37:24.072 region:rollup2
support wasn't there all the

01:37:22.136 --> 01:37:26.140 region:rollup2
asked me to do was to just meet

01:37:24.072 --> 01:37:27.842 region:rollup2
with him and talk about his

01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:29.811 region:rollup2
feelings and. That was that so

01:37:27.842 --> 01:37:31.713 region:rollup2
we've come a long way from that

01:37:29.811 --> 01:37:33.848 region:rollup2
point to actually having

01:37:31.713 --> 01:37:36.084 region:rollup2
resources and support. And so my

01:37:33.848 --> 01:37:37.985 region:rollup2
arms testimony I guess today is

01:37:36.084 --> 01:37:41.789 region:rollup2
really to talk about some of the

01:37:37.985 --> 01:37:43.991 region:rollup2
services and that. Contra Costa

01:37:41.789 --> 01:37:45.960 region:rollup2
county is providing and some of

01:37:43.991 --> 01:37:46.527 region:rollup2
the challenges without but also

01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:50.031 region:rollup2
our commitment to it and so

01:37:46.527 --> 01:37:51.699 region:rollup2
it's.

01:37:50.031 --> 01:37:52.400 region:rollup2
Part of our role is to identify

01:37:51.699 --> 01:37:53.768 region:rollup2
all children that are at risk or

01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:55.903 region:rollup2
currently being exploited so

01:37:53.768 --> 01:37:56.537 region:rollup2
it's not just that you have been

01:37:55.903 --> 01:37:57.905 region:rollup2
exploiting want to know that if

01:37:56.537 --> 01:37:58.439 region:rollup2
there's a possibility that you

01:37:57.905 --> 01:38:00.141 region:rollup2
will be. And we want to

01:37:58.439 --> 01:38:01.909 region:rollup2
intervene to make sure that we

01:38:00.141 --> 01:38:03.945 region:rollup2
prevent.

01:38:01.909 --> 01:38:05.847 region:rollup2
It continuing another part of

01:38:03.945 --> 01:38:08.116 region:rollup2
that is once we've identified in

01:38:05.847 --> 01:38:08.750 region:rollup2
were working with you we want to

01:38:08.116 --> 01:38:09.884 region:rollup2
make sure that we're giving you

01:38:08.750 --> 01:38:11.919 region:rollup2
the best supports.

01:38:09.884 --> 01:38:12.553 region:rollup2
Because the problem with the

01:38:11.919 --> 01:38:14.255 region:rollup2
trauma that they've experienced

01:38:12.553 --> 01:38:15.857 region:rollup2
is yes you've come in with the

01:38:14.255 --> 01:38:17.892 region:rollup2
support and you're there with

01:38:15.857 --> 01:38:20.161 region:rollup2
this is a life long.

01:38:17.892 --> 01:38:22.063 region:rollup2
Challenge that they will happen

01:38:20.161 --> 01:38:24.031 region:rollup2
trauma and stays with you and so

01:38:22.063 --> 01:38:26.134 region:rollup2
I won't necessarily get into

01:38:24.031 --> 01:38:27.969 region:rollup2
trauma one a one but it's not I

01:38:26.134 --> 01:38:29.871 region:rollup2
always feel with the visual

01:38:27.969 --> 01:38:31.906 region:rollup2
sense. It's

01:38:29.871 --> 01:38:32.573 region:rollup2
most people experience trauma

01:38:31.906 --> 01:38:33.841 region:rollup2
they once a blink and have it go

01:38:32.573 --> 01:38:35.943 region:rollup2
away.

01:38:33.841 --> 01:38:36.577 region:rollup2
Kind of like the rain.

01:38:35.943 --> 01:38:38.346 region:rollup2
It rains today and tomorrow the

01:38:36.577 --> 01:38:39.847 region:rollup2
sun comes out and people may

01:38:38.346 --> 01:38:42.049 region:rollup2
ninety remember that it rainy.

01:38:39.847 --> 01:38:43.985 region:rollup2
That is not the same far trauma

01:38:42.049 --> 01:38:44.552 region:rollup2
victims and so one of the things

01:38:43.985 --> 01:38:46.053 region:rollup2
that's a lot of that Contra

01:38:44.552 --> 01:38:48.422 region:rollup2
Costa county dies is we're able

01:38:46.053 --> 01:38:50.291 region:rollup2
to. Get it immediately so we do

01:38:48.422 --> 01:38:52.193 region:rollup2
have their community violent

01:38:50.291 --> 01:38:54.162 region:rollup2
solution we do have a twenty

01:38:52.193 --> 01:38:57.799 region:rollup2
four seven lie crisis line that

01:38:54.162 --> 01:38:58.399 region:rollup2
people can call. And someone

01:38:57.799 --> 01:38:59.834 region:rollup2
will go out and meet with this

01:38:58.399 --> 01:39:00.468 region:rollup2
you.

01:38:59.834 --> 01:39:01.836 region:rollup2
Some of the barriers with that

01:39:00.468 --> 01:39:04.138 region:rollup2
is who knows about it.

01:39:01.836 --> 01:39:06.007 region:rollup2
So that's part of my job is to

01:39:04.138 --> 01:39:08.109 region:rollup2
make sure that everyone is aware

01:39:06.007 --> 01:39:10.144 region:rollup2
that leases aware that the other

01:39:08.109 --> 01:39:11.946 region:rollup2
police officers when they're out

01:39:10.144 --> 01:39:13.981 region:rollup2
are where everyone needs to know

01:39:11.946 --> 01:39:16.050 region:rollup2
that that service exists.

01:39:13.981 --> 01:39:16.651 region:rollup2
The other components is making

01:39:16.050 --> 01:39:17.952 region:rollup2
sure that people not is a drop

01:39:16.651 --> 01:39:19.854 region:rollup2
in center.

01:39:17.952 --> 01:39:20.421 region:rollup2
In Richmond.

01:39:19.854 --> 01:39:22.190 region:rollup2
I am so we're getting that

01:39:20.421 --> 01:39:24.225 region:rollup2
information out making sure that

01:39:22.190 --> 01:39:27.829 region:rollup2
the social workers know that the

01:39:24.225 --> 01:39:28.496 region:rollup2
laws have changed a lot of it is

01:39:27.829 --> 01:39:29.864 region:rollup2
the information as things change

01:39:28.496 --> 01:39:32.266 region:rollup2
we have to get out.

01:39:29.864 --> 01:39:35.870 region:rollup2
And how we get it out a lot of

01:39:32.266 --> 01:39:38.005 region:rollup2
times we write things down.

01:39:35.870 --> 01:39:38.639 region:rollup2
We get brochures we get emails

01:39:38.005 --> 01:39:39.907 region:rollup2
and I'm since people don't read

01:39:38.639 --> 01:39:41.909 region:rollup2
it.

01:39:39.907 --> 01:39:44.212 region:rollup2
But people watch commercials.

01:39:41.909 --> 01:39:46.113 region:rollup2
People love to see media they

01:39:44.212 --> 01:39:46.647 region:rollup2
like to see things in front of

01:39:46.113 --> 01:39:47.915 region:rollup2
them that are flashing in

01:39:46.647 --> 01:39:48.583 region:rollup2
moving.

01:39:47.915 --> 01:39:50.184 region:rollup2
And so that's also part of our

01:39:48.583 --> 01:39:51.886 region:rollup2
strategies that use different

01:39:50.184 --> 01:39:54.188 region:rollup2
ways of communicating.

01:39:51.886 --> 01:39:54.789 region:rollup2
Right because a lot of times how

01:39:54.188 --> 01:39:56.057 region:rollup2
many vets get business cards

01:39:54.789 --> 01:39:56.657 region:rollup2
wood business cards you

01:39:56.057 --> 01:39:57.925 region:rollup2
sometimes you look at them any

01:39:56.657 --> 01:40:00.294 region:rollup2
put away.

01:39:57.925 --> 01:40:02.096 region:rollup2
And you're like all I remember I

01:40:00.294 --> 01:40:03.998 region:rollup2
did speak to someone about that

01:40:02.096 --> 01:40:04.665 region:rollup2
we get no idea where it it. Has

01:40:03.998 --> 01:40:06.267 region:rollup2
a part of our strategy is also

01:40:04.665 --> 01:40:07.935 region:rollup2
having our information on a

01:40:06.267 --> 01:40:10.204 region:rollup2
website.

01:40:07.935 --> 01:40:12.240 region:rollup2
If you can't get me on the phone

01:40:10.204 --> 01:40:12.807 region:rollup2
you know exactly where to go to

01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:13.975 region:rollup2
get that the concept that is

01:40:12.807 --> 01:40:16.344 region:rollup2
needed.

01:40:13.975 --> 01:40:18.212 region:rollup2
The other parts as far as

01:40:16.344 --> 01:40:20.281 region:rollup2
barriers I think I don't need to

01:40:18.212 --> 01:40:22.383 region:rollup2
get into what more the barriers

01:40:20.281 --> 01:40:24.418 region:rollup2
are. Aye deftly feel that.

01:40:22.383 --> 01:40:25.600 region:rollup2
When we're out looking into

01:40:24.418 --> 01:40:25.600 region:rollup2
giving information.

01:40:25.953 --> 01:40:29.900 region:rollup2
Sometimes we get the same

01:40:29.957 --> 01:40:31.959 region:rollup2
And so that becomes a barrier

01:40:30.558 --> 01:40:34.328 region:rollup2
so if.

01:40:31.959 --> 01:40:35.963 region:rollup2
Certain people come that only

01:40:34.328 --> 01:40:38.065 region:rollup2
certain people know.

01:40:35.963 --> 01:40:38.699 region:rollup2
Everyone needs to know.

01:40:38.065 --> 01:40:39.967 region:rollup2
Every whether you have children

01:40:38.699 --> 01:40:42.169 region:rollup2
or not.

01:40:39.967 --> 01:40:43.971 region:rollup2
Because everyone weekends are

01:40:42.169 --> 01:40:44.605 region:rollup2
actually each other in different

01:40:43.971 --> 01:40:46.207 region:rollup2
ways we all catch the part we

01:40:44.605 --> 01:40:48.309 region:rollup2
all see the five we all go to

01:40:46.207 --> 01:40:50.244 region:rollup2
the mall well good grocery

01:40:48.309 --> 01:40:50.878 region:rollup2
stores. Were all interacting

01:40:50.244 --> 01:40:54.048 region:rollup2
with each other so there's no

01:40:50.878 --> 01:40:54.649 region:rollup2
need for only one demographic to

01:40:54.048 --> 01:40:56.250 region:rollup2
go everyone needs sit out and

01:40:54.649 --> 01:40:59.987 region:rollup2
that's part of our role is to

01:40:56.250 --> 01:41:02.156 region:rollup2
spread the word.

01:40:59.987 --> 01:41:04.025 region:rollup2
The great thing about cuts

01:41:02.156 --> 01:41:05.993 region:rollup2
across the county is working in

01:41:04.025 --> 01:41:07.995 region:rollup2
a collaborative effort.

01:41:05.993 --> 01:41:08.596 region:rollup2
We're not alone.

01:41:07.995 --> 01:41:10.264 region:rollup2
Should never feel like you're

01:41:08.596 --> 01:41:12.199 region:rollup2
alone in this fight there's so

01:41:10.264 --> 01:41:12.833 region:rollup2
many resources that you can

01:41:12.199 --> 01:41:14.001 region:rollup2
connect with and if there's a

01:41:12.833 --> 01:41:14.535 region:rollup2
resource doesn't exist.

01:41:14.001 --> 01:41:18.039 region:rollup2
That we can collaborate to

01:41:14.535 --> 01:41:20.007 region:rollup2
create.

01:41:18.039 --> 01:41:20.608 region:rollup2
And so that's one thing that's

01:41:20.007 --> 01:41:22.209 region:rollup2
really great about us working

01:41:20.608 --> 01:41:24.178 region:rollup2
with the steering committee.

01:41:22.209 --> 01:41:26.180 region:rollup2
Working with RC sack team to

01:41:24.178 --> 01:41:28.115 region:rollup2
make sure that we're prepared

01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:28.783 region:rollup2
making brain awareness week

01:41:28.115 --> 01:41:30.251 region:rollup2
doing prevention right down to

01:41:28.783 --> 01:41:32.320 region:rollup2
find our children.

01:41:30.251 --> 01:41:36.057 region:rollup2
And we're providing the

01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:38.359 region:rollup2
resources that they need.

01:41:36.057 --> 01:41:40.161 region:rollup2
I think that's all I need to to

01:41:38.359 --> 01:41:40.528 region:rollup2
say about.

01:41:40.161 --> 01:41:42.363 region:rollup2
Working with.

01:41:40.528 --> 01:41:44.065 region:rollup2
The children and.

01:41:42.363 --> 01:41:46.033 region:rollup2
Cuts across the county.

01:41:44.065 --> 01:41:48.069 region:rollup2
Thank you so much for your

01:41:46.033 --> 01:41:48.536 region:rollup2
energy passion hope.

01:41:48.069 --> 01:41:50.037 region:rollup2
That you have in your

01:41:48.536 --> 01:41:52.139 region:rollup2
presentation

01:41:50.037 --> 01:41:52.606 region:rollup2

01:41:52.139 --> 01:41:56.077 region:rollup2
our final presenter.

01:41:52.606 --> 01:41:58.112 region:rollup2
Today and that is less

01:41:56.077 --> 01:42:00.114 region:rollup2
Higashi.

01:41:58.112 --> 01:42:00.648 region:rollup2
But that is pillars of hope.

01:42:00.114 --> 01:42:02.416 region:rollup2
My can throw away probably

01:42:00.648 --> 01:42:04.352 region:rollup2
ninety five. Percent of what I

01:42:02.416 --> 01:42:06.087 region:rollup2
was gonna say because it would

01:42:04.352 --> 01:42:08.255 region:rollup2
said everything so well.

01:42:06.087 --> 01:42:10.057 region:rollup2
And thank you so much a assembly

01:42:08.255 --> 01:42:12.093 region:rollup2

here for inviting me here.

01:42:12.093 --> 01:42:16.497 region:rollup2
As a father as a grandfather in

01:42:14.428 --> 01:42:18.566 region:rollup2
as a volunteer in despite.

01:42:16.497 --> 01:42:20.234 region:rollup2
Does something that I'm very

01:42:18.566 --> 01:42:22.103 region:rollup2
very passionate about. I'm of.

01:42:20.234 --> 01:42:24.305 region:rollup2
.

01:42:22.103 --> 01:42:24.672 region:rollup2
I am very encouraged but out but

01:42:24.305 --> 01:42:26.674 region:rollup2
I'm here today.

01:42:24.672 --> 01:42:30.044 region:rollup2
I've learned a lot even though

01:42:26.674 --> 01:42:30.711 region:rollup2
I've I've had no I've gathered a

01:42:30.044 --> 01:42:34.181 region:rollup2
lot of information in the fight.

01:42:30.711 --> 01:42:36.183 region:rollup2
One of the things that I do is

01:42:34.181 --> 01:42:38.119 region:rollup2
I I volunteer for. A.

01:42:36.183 --> 01:42:40.388 region:rollup2
Home because colors of hope.

01:42:38.119 --> 01:42:42.123 region:rollup2
There were a very very small

01:42:40.388 --> 01:42:44.325 region:rollup2
nonprofit.

01:42:42.123 --> 01:42:48.095 region:rollup2
We struggle everyday to make our

01:42:44.325 --> 01:42:50.097 region:rollup2
bills we struggle every to give

01:42:48.095 --> 01:42:50.498 region:rollup2
hope and restoration two girls

01:42:50.097 --> 01:42:52.366 region:rollup2
that have been.

01:42:50.498 --> 01:42:52.700 region:rollup2
Better survived human

01:42:52.366 --> 01:42:54.602 region:rollup2
trafficking.

01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:56.604 region:rollup2
And one of the things that we do

01:42:54.602 --> 01:42:58.372 region:rollup2
is we. Give them not only a home

01:42:56.604 --> 01:43:00.074 region:rollup2
environment but we get them a

01:42:58.372 --> 01:43:02.109 region:rollup2
loving home environment.

01:43:00.074 --> 01:43:04.178 region:rollup2
Something that they haven't had

01:43:02.109 --> 01:43:06.047 region:rollup2
in a very very long time whether

01:43:04.178 --> 01:43:08.149 region:rollup2
they grew up in a very very

01:43:06.047 --> 01:43:10.184 region:rollup2
abusive family or whether they

01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:12.153 region:rollup2
grew up in an abusive situation.

01:43:10.184 --> 01:43:12.720 region:rollup2
And of course being exploited

01:43:12.153 --> 01:43:14.188 region:rollup2
that was very very violent

01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:14.388 region:rollup2
abusive as well.

01:43:14.188 --> 01:43:18.259 region:rollup2
And.

01:43:14.388 --> 01:43:18.592 region:rollup2
It's very difficult as eight

01:43:18.259 --> 01:43:22.430 region:rollup2
organization.

01:43:18.592 --> 01:43:24.065 region:rollup2
Such as ours to do the things

01:43:22.430 --> 01:43:24.699 region:rollup2
that we need to do because one

01:43:24.065 --> 01:43:26.467 region:rollup2
of our barriers is of course is

01:43:24.699 --> 01:43:28.502 region:rollup2
money. And we've all talked

01:43:26.467 --> 01:43:30.438 region:rollup2
about money and we work with a

01:43:28.502 --> 01:43:32.707 region:rollup2
wonderful wonderful NGOs if you

01:43:30.438 --> 01:43:34.442 region:rollup2
ever. Have a chance to volunteer

01:43:32.707 --> 01:43:36.277 region:rollup2
for an NGO ninety and I

01:43:34.442 --> 01:43:38.212 region:rollup2
encourage you in this field. To

01:43:36.277 --> 01:43:40.347 region:rollup2
volunteer to to

01:43:38.212 --> 01:43:42.416 region:rollup2
spend a couple days to do.

01:43:40.347 --> 01:43:44.151 region:rollup2
Whatever you need to do because

01:43:42.416 --> 01:43:44.785 region:rollup2
you can see a passion gonna see

01:43:44.151 --> 01:43:48.222 region:rollup2
a calling on the people's lives

01:43:44.785 --> 01:43:50.224 region:rollup2
to do this fight.

01:43:48.222 --> 01:43:52.226 region:rollup2
And one of the things is that.

01:43:50.224 --> 01:43:54.462 region:rollup2
It is to get.

01:43:52.226 --> 01:43:56.430 region:rollup2
For for media personally is that

01:43:54.462 --> 01:43:58.466 region:rollup2
I feel that I need to be I need

01:43:56.430 --> 01:44:00.234 region:rollup2
to get people as passionate

01:43:58.466 --> 01:44:02.303 region:rollup2
about it as I am.

01:44:00.234 --> 01:44:04.338 region:rollup2
Against this fight because every

01:44:02.303 --> 01:44:06.440 region:rollup2
day every minute someone is

01:44:04.338 --> 01:44:08.275 region:rollup2
being exploited somebody's

01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:10.711 region:rollup2
daughter is being exploited.

01:44:08.275 --> 01:44:12.680 region:rollup2
And so as pillars will we like

01:44:10.711 --> 01:44:14.482 region:rollup2
to do is we like to get that

01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:16.250 region:rollup2
child we'd like to get the or

01:44:14.482 --> 01:44:18.319 region:rollup2
what we're up face to right now.

01:44:16.250 --> 01:44:20.154 region:rollup2
I would like to be a phase one

01:44:18.319 --> 01:44:22.289 region:rollup2
where we get sea sick kids.

01:44:20.154 --> 01:44:22.556 region:rollup2
That's a long way down the down

01:44:22.289 --> 01:44:24.492 region:rollup2
the road.

01:44:22.556 --> 01:44:26.494 region:rollup2
But right now we're face to we

01:44:24.492 --> 01:44:28.162 region:rollup2
have a we have adult women

01:44:26.494 --> 01:44:30.631 region:rollup2
eighteen and over.

01:44:28.162 --> 01:44:32.166 region:rollup2
And. What we want to do is we

01:44:30.631 --> 01:44:34.135 region:rollup2
want to give them a holistic?

01:44:32.166 --> 01:44:36.137 region:rollup2
Care

01:44:34.135 --> 01:44:38.172 region:rollup2
we want to give them their

01:44:36.137 --> 01:44:42.176 region:rollup2
dental their medical accounts

01:44:38.172 --> 01:44:44.478 region:rollup2
lean education. Job training.

01:44:42.176 --> 01:44:46.447 region:rollup2
And that that I'm quickly costs

01:44:44.478 --> 01:44:48.482 region:rollup2
money. And it's very very

01:44:46.447 --> 01:44:50.551 region:rollup2
expensive it's not the it's not

01:44:48.482 --> 01:44:52.453 region:rollup2
something that we can just do it

01:44:50.551 --> 01:44:54.555 region:rollup2
a couple dollars we need a lot

01:44:52.453 --> 01:44:56.223 region:rollup2
of money. So in that in that.

01:44:54.555 --> 01:44:58.292 region:rollup2
That.

01:44:56.223 --> 01:45:00.294 region:rollup2
One of our main things we do is

01:44:58.292 --> 01:45:00.828 region:rollup2
we do a lot fund raising. That

01:45:00.294 --> 01:45:02.696 region:rollup2
is one of our main focuses

01:45:00.828 --> 01:45:04.465 region:rollup2
and I feel that that's one of

01:45:02.696 --> 01:45:06.233 region:rollup2
the things that we know that we

01:45:04.465 --> 01:45:08.202 region:rollup2
have to do it.

01:45:06.233 --> 01:45:08.602 region:rollup2
But is something that takes away

01:45:08.202 --> 01:45:10.237 region:rollup2
time and energy.

01:45:08.602 --> 01:45:12.239 region:rollup2
Helping these women.

01:45:10.237 --> 01:45:14.508 region:rollup2
In helping these kids

01:45:12.239 --> 01:45:16.577 region:rollup2
the other thing we've addresses

01:45:14.508 --> 01:45:18.479 region:rollup2
well is is you know I I don't

01:45:16.577 --> 01:45:18.679 region:rollup2
know of any any houses that.

01:45:18.479 --> 01:45:20.281 region:rollup2
That.

01:45:18.679 --> 01:45:22.616 region:rollup2
.

01:45:20.281 --> 01:45:24.418 region:rollup2
That houses voice that had been

01:45:22.616 --> 01:45:26.253 region:rollup2
exploited across the United

01:45:24.418 --> 01:45:28.289 region:rollup2
States I think.

01:45:26.253 --> 01:45:28.722 region:rollup2
I heard of one maybe there's two

01:45:28.289 --> 01:45:30.724 region:rollup2
now I am not sure.

01:45:28.722 --> 01:45:31.292 region:rollup2
But that something as a County

01:45:30.724 --> 01:45:32.359 region:rollup2
at the we need to address as

01:45:31.292 --> 01:45:34.528 region:rollup2
well.

01:45:32.359 --> 01:45:36.230 region:rollup2
Is I know that there's I've I've

01:45:34.528 --> 01:45:38.232 region:rollup2
spoken to people

01:45:36.230 --> 01:45:40.234 region:rollup2
spoken demand that it had that

01:45:38.232 --> 01:45:40.801 region:rollup2
been. Exploiters exploited

01:45:40.234 --> 01:45:42.236 region:rollup2
themselves to survive in the

01:45:40.801 --> 01:45:42.803 region:rollup2
streets

01:45:42.236 --> 01:45:44.305 region:rollup2
as a run away running from

01:45:42.803 --> 01:45:46.307 region:rollup2
adobe's situation.

01:45:44.305 --> 01:45:50.277 region:rollup2
.

01:45:46.307 --> 01:45:50.511 region:rollup2
Pillars is is world fairly

01:45:50.277 --> 01:45:52.279 region:rollup2
young.

01:45:50.511 --> 01:45:54.448 region:rollup2
Organization

01:45:52.279 --> 01:45:56.617 region:rollup2
still learning every day every

01:45:54.448 --> 01:45:58.485 region:rollup2
every. Every person that we come

01:45:56.617 --> 01:45:58.786 region:rollup2
in we we just start taking

01:45:58.485 --> 01:46:00.788 region:rollup2
people and.

01:45:58.786 --> 01:46:02.289 region:rollup2
How women and survivors in the

01:46:00.788 --> 01:46:04.558 region:rollup2
last year?

01:46:02.289 --> 01:46:08.295 region:rollup2
So it's been a learning

01:46:04.558 --> 01:46:08.596 region:rollup2
experience for us and them even

01:46:08.295 --> 01:46:12.266 region:rollup2
though we.

01:46:08.596 --> 01:46:12.933 region:rollup2
We fully prepared to to take on

01:46:12.266 --> 01:46:14.301 region:rollup2
this task everyday it's it it's

01:46:12.933 --> 01:46:18.405 region:rollup2
new it's a new challenge for us.

01:46:14.301 --> 01:46:20.307 region:rollup2
So we would love to work with.

01:46:18.405 --> 01:46:22.476 region:rollup2
Other organizations in

01:46:20.307 --> 01:46:24.378 region:rollup2
collaboration and down and be

01:46:22.476 --> 01:46:26.580 region:rollup2
able to.

01:46:24.378 --> 01:46:28.649 region:rollup2
Make ourselves aware to use

01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:30.618 region:rollup2
what we provide. To the agencies

01:46:28.649 --> 01:46:32.553 region:rollup2
and what we can do and what and

01:46:30.618 --> 01:46:34.355 region:rollup2
and and I don't see what you

01:46:32.553 --> 01:46:36.323 region:rollup2
guys can do with us.

01:46:34.355 --> 01:46:36.991 region:rollup2
And to to collaborate so maybe

01:46:36.323 --> 01:46:40.361 region:rollup2
that some of the costs that we

01:46:36.991 --> 01:46:40.961 region:rollup2
have. Maybe that can be.

01:46:40.361 --> 01:46:42.363 region:rollup2
Taken up by another agency as

01:46:40.961 --> 01:46:44.465 region:rollup2
well.

01:46:42.363 --> 01:46:46.500 region:rollup2
And I think that if we can

01:46:44.465 --> 01:46:48.402 region:rollup2
streamline and we come together

01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:50.404 region:rollup2
as organizations both. A

01:46:48.402 --> 01:46:52.740 region:rollup2
governmental law enforcement and

01:46:50.404 --> 01:46:54.375 region:rollup2
NGOs and we can do something

01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:56.377 region:rollup2
that we're not being so

01:46:54.375 --> 01:46:56.944 region:rollup2
redundant. In our in our task

01:46:56.377 --> 01:46:58.412 region:rollup2
for that same person or the

01:46:56.944 --> 01:46:58.812 region:rollup2
scene.

01:46:58.412 --> 01:47:00.648 region:rollup2
Same out victim.

01:46:58.812 --> 01:47:01.215 region:rollup2
Survivor that would be

01:47:00.648 --> 01:47:02.416 region:rollup2
something that we can do as

01:47:01.215 --> 01:47:02.716 region:rollup2
well.

01:47:02.416 --> 01:47:06.353 region:rollup2
The other.

01:47:02.716 --> 01:47:06.987 region:rollup2
Thing I'd like to speak on is

01:47:06.353 --> 01:47:08.389 region:rollup2
that and we spoke on and what

01:47:06.987 --> 01:47:09.056 region:rollup2
can we do better.

01:47:08.389 --> 01:47:10.291 region:rollup2
And I think one of things we can

01:47:09.056 --> 01:47:12.459 region:rollup2
do better.

01:47:10.291 --> 01:47:14.395 region:rollup2
And this something that's also

01:47:12.459 --> 01:47:16.297 region:rollup2
and very very passion about.

01:47:14.395 --> 01:47:18.666 region:rollup2
Is that I go to a lot of.

01:47:16.297 --> 01:47:20.301 region:rollup2
Human trafficking anti human

01:47:18.666 --> 01:47:24.338 region:rollup2
trafficking things.

01:47:20.301 --> 01:47:24.672 region:rollup2
And I am.

01:47:24.338 --> 01:47:26.440 region:rollup2
Sadly to say.

01:47:24.672 --> 01:47:30.344 region:rollup2
The meetings are with.

01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:32.446 region:rollup2
Mostly women.

01:47:30.344 --> 01:47:32.680 region:rollup2
Very few men.

01:47:32.446 --> 01:47:34.915 region:rollup2
So men.

01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:36.784 region:rollup2
We are absent in the fight but

01:47:34.915 --> 01:47:38.419 region:rollup2
we're we're ninety per eight

01:47:36.784 --> 01:47:40.421 region:rollup2
percent of the demand.

01:47:38.419 --> 01:47:42.423 region:rollup2
Something wrong with that.

01:47:40.421 --> 01:47:44.425 region:rollup2
Why don't we their?

01:47:42.423 --> 01:47:48.329 region:rollup2
When we their in the fight.

01:47:44.425 --> 01:47:48.796 region:rollup2
We are the demand side.

01:47:48.329 --> 01:47:52.299 region:rollup2
The reason why these

01:47:48.796 --> 01:47:56.437 region:rollup2
organizations exist is because

01:47:52.299 --> 01:47:57.104 region:rollup2
men. By women and children.

01:47:56.437 --> 01:48:00.474 region:rollup2
That is the only reason why we

01:47:57.104 --> 01:48:01.108 region:rollup2
are even talking about this.

01:48:00.474 --> 01:48:04.478 region:rollup2
This something that we need to

01:48:01.108 --> 01:48:05.112 region:rollup2
address as men.

01:48:04.478 --> 01:48:08.382 region:rollup2
And and we need to talk or boys

01:48:05.112 --> 01:48:10.651 region:rollup2
about as well.

01:48:08.382 --> 01:48:12.553 region:rollup2
Boys these days they say are

01:48:10.651 --> 01:48:16.457 region:rollup2
exposed to hard core* at the

01:48:12.553 --> 01:48:17.024 region:rollup2
age of eight.

01:48:16.457 --> 01:48:20.461 region:rollup2
There's something wrong with

01:48:17.024 --> 01:48:22.563 region:rollup2
that picture.

01:48:20.461 --> 01:48:24.865 region:rollup2
I am lucky to also.

01:48:22.563 --> 01:48:26.467 region:rollup2
Be involved with Alameda

01:48:24.865 --> 01:48:26.633 region:rollup2
district attorney's office

01:48:26.467 --> 01:48:28.502 region:rollup2
on.

01:48:26.633 --> 01:48:30.504 region:rollup2
On.

01:48:28.502 --> 01:48:32.639 region:rollup2
And he project.

01:48:30.504 --> 01:48:33.240 region:rollup2
What we address the demand side

01:48:32.639 --> 01:48:36.543 region:rollup2
but it's a very small fight

01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:38.612 region:rollup2
right now?

01:48:36.543 --> 01:48:39.179 region:rollup2
Let's not keep on fighting this

01:48:38.612 --> 01:48:40.547 region:rollup2
thing downstream let's fight

01:48:39.179 --> 01:48:42.449 region:rollup2
upstream.

01:48:40.547 --> 01:48:44.885 region:rollup2
So.

01:48:42.449 --> 01:48:46.420 region:rollup2
I had I hope I've made myself

01:48:44.885 --> 01:48:46.720 region:rollup2
clear.

01:48:46.420 --> 01:48:48.422 region:rollup2
Aye I love.

01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:50.424 region:rollup2
.

01:48:48.422 --> 01:48:50.858 region:rollup2
The fact that.

01:48:50.424 --> 01:48:52.426 region:rollup2
That I get to speak

01:48:50.858 --> 01:48:54.995 region:rollup2
on this issue.

01:48:52.426 --> 01:48:55.529 region:rollup2
I love the fact that them I

01:48:54.995 --> 01:48:56.430 region:rollup2
meeting new people on the

01:48:55.529 --> 01:49:00.634 region:rollup2
flight.

01:48:56.430 --> 01:49:02.503 region:rollup2

podium right over here.

Public comment NDEs.

01:49:54.621 --> 01:49:58.492 region:rollup2
About two minutes for each

01:49:55.189 --> 01:50:02.529 region:rollup2
speaker so if you have a comment

01:49:58.492 --> 01:50:06.533 region:rollup2

Please.

01:50:06.533 --> 01:50:08.535 region:rollup2
Yeah I just like to comment

01:50:07.101 --> 01:50:12.539 region:rollup2
about one thing.

01:50:08.535 --> 01:50:13.006 region:rollup2
You have all these people that

01:50:12.539 --> 01:50:14.575 region:rollup2
are being sent up for

01:50:13.006 --> 01:50:15.209 region:rollup2
trafficking.

01:50:14.575 --> 01:50:16.577 region:rollup2
He's been in the papers left and

01:50:15.209 --> 01:50:18.579 region:rollup2
right.

01:50:16.577 --> 01:50:20.881 region:rollup2
But what I like to know is.

01:50:18.579 --> 01:50:21.415 region:rollup2
Why in the world are these

01:50:20.881 --> 01:50:24.551 region:rollup2
people get enough with the

01:50:21.415 --> 01:50:26.553 region:rollup2
deals?

01:50:24.551 --> 01:50:28.555 region:rollup2
Every time you turn around.

01:50:26.553 --> 01:50:30.557 region:rollup2
It's a plea deal.

01:50:28.555 --> 01:50:32.559 region:rollup2
A plea deal to where.

01:50:30.557 --> 01:50:34.561 region:rollup2
Okay.

01:50:32.559 --> 01:50:36.964 region:rollup2
Well his name is senior again.

01:50:34.561 --> 01:50:38.565 region:rollup2
Why is it taking care of the

01:50:36.964 --> 01:50:40.567 region:rollup2
first time?

01:50:38.565 --> 01:50:42.569 region:rollup2
Why isn't just cut?

01:50:40.567 --> 01:50:44.605 region:rollup2
To where. Hey.

01:50:42.569 --> 01:50:46.607 region:rollup2
He's gone out.

01:50:44.605 --> 01:50:48.609 region:rollup2
And he's trafficking these.

01:50:46.607 --> 01:50:50.611 region:rollup2
Women.

01:50:48.609 --> 01:50:52.613 region:rollup2
Underage girls.

01:50:50.611 --> 01:50:54.615 region:rollup2
And he gets a free deal.

01:50:52.613 --> 01:50:56.950 region:rollup2
He does go to prison.

01:50:54.615 --> 01:50:57.184 region:rollup2
But he's gonna be out maybe ten

01:50:56.950 --> 01:50:58.585 region:rollup2
years.

01:50:57.184 --> 01:51:02.589 region:rollup2
Maybe seven years.

01:50:58.585 --> 01:51:04.591 region:rollup2
Why is he put away for life?

01:51:02.589 --> 01:51:08.595 region:rollup2
I don't understand that.

01:51:04.591 --> 01:51:09.163 region:rollup2
It goes over and over and over.

01:51:08.595 --> 01:51:10.797 region:rollup2
They had one guy and you're

01:51:09.163 --> 01:51:12.599 region:rollup2
that.

01:51:10.797 --> 01:51:13.267 region:rollup2
From Lafayette.

01:51:12.599 --> 01:51:15.002 region:rollup2
I mean it took you repeat this

01:51:13.267 --> 01:51:18.639 region:rollup2
corpus to finally find out what

01:51:15.002 --> 01:51:20.641 region:rollup2
he was up to.

01:51:18.639 --> 01:51:22.676 region:rollup2
It took over ten years.

01:51:20.641 --> 01:51:26.680 region:rollup2
I don't understand it.

01:51:22.676 --> 01:51:28.682 region:rollup2
It's not so much on the streets.

01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:31.084 region:rollup2
But through the court system.

01:51:28.682 --> 01:51:34.655 region:rollup2
And that is where we're having

01:51:31.084 --> 01:51:36.623 region:rollup2
problems.

01:51:34.655 --> 01:51:38.692 region:rollup2
And if anything else like we've

01:51:36.623 --> 01:51:40.694 region:rollup2
done our right with marijuana we

01:51:38.692 --> 01:51:41.028 region:rollup2
may that to where. You can buy

01:51:40.694 --> 01:51:44.665 region:rollup2
for bags and.

01:51:41.028 --> 01:51:45.299 region:rollup2
Whatever.

01:51:44.665 --> 01:51:46.667 region:rollup2
But the thing is is wears is

01:51:45.299 --> 01:51:49.102 region:rollup2
going to stop.

01:51:46.667 --> 01:51:50.671 region:rollup2
Why can't we get something out

01:51:49.102 --> 01:51:52.706 region:rollup2
there to where?

01:51:50.671 --> 01:51:53.340 region:rollup2
Okay.

01:51:52.706 --> 01:51:56.710 region:rollup2
You're gonna put for twenty five

01:51:53.340 --> 01:51:57.010 region:rollup2
years.

01:51:56.710 --> 01:51:58.712 region:rollup2
Obviously.

01:51:57.010 --> 01:52:00.714 region:rollup2
It's not happening.

01:51:58.712 --> 01:52:02.716 region:rollup2
Because these people.

01:52:00.714 --> 01:52:03.250 region:rollup2
Get back on the streets.

01:52:02.716 --> 01:52:08.689 region:rollup2
And they do what they did

01:52:03.250 --> 01:52:09.323 region:rollup2
before.

01:52:08.689 --> 01:52:10.691 region:rollup2
And it doesn't make any sense to

01:52:09.323 --> 01:52:12.693 region:rollup2
me.

01:52:10.691 --> 01:52:13.360 region:rollup2
Thank you.

01:52:12.693 --> 01:52:14.895 region:rollup2

this.

01:52:38.885 --> 01:52:42.723 region:rollup2
Today I think this is a great

01:52:40.887 --> 01:52:43.390 region:rollup2
opportunity for.

01:52:42.723 --> 01:52:44.992 region:rollup2
A lot of different organizations

01:52:43.390 --> 01:52:46.760 region:rollup2

01:52:44.992 --> 01:52:47.227 region:rollup2
community to really be able to

01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:49.029 region:rollup2
partner. And really.

01:52:47.227 --> 01:52:50.731 region:rollup2
Make a difference.

01:52:49.029 --> 01:52:51.331 region:rollup2

01:52:52.1000 --> 01:52:56.870 region:rollup2
experience.

01:52:54.735 --> 01:52:58.772 region:rollup2
In empowering young adults in

01:52:56.870 --> 01:53:00.841 region:rollup2
use in.

01:52:58.772 --> 01:53:01.241 region:rollup2
Overcoming the human

01:53:00.841 --> 01:53:04.778 region:rollup2
trafficking and.

01:53:01.241 --> 01:53:06.780 region:rollup2
Trauma that they've endured.

01:53:04.778 --> 01:53:08.849 region:rollup2
And and there is many.

01:53:06.780 --> 01:53:10.784 region:rollup2
I know other organizations I've

01:53:08.849 --> 01:53:12.753 region:rollup2
been part of pillars of hope in

01:53:10.784 --> 01:53:16.757 region:rollup2
the past and.

01:53:12.753 --> 01:53:18.759 region:rollup2
