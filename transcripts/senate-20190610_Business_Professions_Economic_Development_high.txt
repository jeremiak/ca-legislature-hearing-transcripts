I AM IS TO TRY TO KEEP HIS ROLE GOING FOR YOU GUYS YEAH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I AUTHORED AB FOR A ONE WHICH AUTHORIZES THE BOARD OF PHARMACY. TO ISSUE REMOTE DISPENSING PHARMACY LICENSES FOR PHARMACIES TO USE TELEPHONE MISSY TO CONNECT WITH PATIENTS. AND MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS. HOWEVER WHEN THE LAW WAS DEVELOPED THE BOARD OF PHARMACY WAS TASKED WITH DEVELOPING REGULATIONS TO SET THE REQUIRED ADDITIONAL TRAINING NECESSARY FOR A PHARMACY TECHNICIAN. TO WORK AT A REMOTE DISPENSING SIDE. THIS RULE MAKING HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED MEANING THAT TWO YEARS LATER TELL A PHARMACY IN CALIFORNIA IS STILL NOT A REALITY. AB SIX NINETY ADDRESSES THIS DELAY BY CODIFYING THE QUALIFICATIONS REQUIRED FOR A PHARMACY TECHNICIAN. TO WORK IN A REMOTE DISPENSING PHARMACY. THE LANGUAGE COMES DIRECTLY FROM THE BOARD OF PHARMACY'S DRAFT REGULATIONS ON THIS ISSUE. I'VE ALSO ALSO RECENTLY AMENDED THE BILL TO INCLUDE PROVISIONS ALLOWING A PHARMACY THAT IS DAMAGED OR DESTROYED IN AN EMERGENCY TO QUICKLY REESTABLISH ITSELF. IN A NEW LOCATION WITHOUT HAVING TO RESTART THE FULL LICENSING PROCESS AS IF IT WERE A BRAND NEW PHARMACY. THIS LANGUAGE IS SPONSORED BY THE BOARD OF PHARMACY AND CONTAINS AN URGENCY CLAUSE SO THAT THE LAW CAN BE PLACED IN FOR OUR NEXT FIRE. SEASON [inaudible] IRONICALLY NOW. THESE CHANGES TO PHARMACY LAW WILL HELP THOSE INVULNERABLE AREAS. ACCESS PHARMACY CARE. I HAVE WITH YOU TODAY MR JOHNSON WITH ME YOU ON BEHALF OF CARDINAL HEALTH AND I ALSO HAVE BEEN IN IT FOR NOT DANCING BUT WELCOME [inaudible] MARCH. A GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISSY JOHNSON WITH NELSON MARKS MARIE HERE BE HEART HERE ON BEHALF OF CARDINAL HEALTH. CARDINAL HEALTH IS ONE OF THE NATION'S LARGEST WHOLESALERS THE PROVIDE SERVICES -- DELIVERY SERVICES F MEDICAL SUPPLIES PHARMACEUTICALS TO HOSPITALS CLINICS DOCTORS OFFICES PHARMACIES XTERRA -- SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE THE SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED OR THEY PROVIDE THE MATERIALS THAT ARE NEEDED IN THE DELIVERY OF HEALTH CARE. CARDINAL HEALTH ALSO OFFERS A VARIETY OF SERVICES TO INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES TO HELP THEM WITH THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF OF THE INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES AND ONE OF THOSE SERVICES IS THE TELE. PHARMACY SERVICE I'M AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID AB SIX NINETY WILL HELP REALIZE THE GOALS OF AB FOR A ONE BY CODIFYING THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE REMOTE DISPENSING TECHNICIANS. OPERATING UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF PHARMACISTS AT THE REMOTE DISPENSING SITES. THIS BILL AB SIX NINETY ATTEMPTS TO EXPEDITE NOT CIRCUMVENT THE DISCUSSION AND APPROVAL OF THESE REQUIREMENTS SO THAT CALIFORNIANS IN UNDERSERVED AREAS WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. AND FOR THAT WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE THE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE NEXT WITNESS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF MEMBERS DANNY MARTINEZ THE CALIFORNIA FARMS ASSOCIATION. WE DON'T HAVE A LETTER IN BUT WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL ON AND I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE THE PIECE DEALING WITH NATURAL DISASTERS WE ACTUALLY HAVE A MEMBER. OF OURS WHO OPERATES IN THE PARADISE AREA WHO LOST THEIR PHARMACY DO THE FIFTY TO THE FIRE THAT WAS UP THERE. ONE THING THAT WE FOUND OUT WAS THAT AS SHE TRIED TO REESTABLISH FOR PHARMACY -- SHE WAS TOLD SHE HAD TO UNDERGO A WHOLE NEW LICENSING PROCESS WHICH THEN DELAYS THE MEDI CAL CATION IF SHE DECIDES TO GO TO MEDICAL WHICH THEN DELAYS -- ANY SORT OF HEALTH PLAN OR THIRD PARTY PAYER PROCESS. AND SHE WAS LOOKING AT ABOUT PROBABLY ABOUT TWO YEARS OUT FROM IT RE ESTABLISHING HER. HER PHARMACY DUE TO SOMETHING THAT WASN'T HER PROBLEM TO BEGIN WITH HER OR HER SHE DIDN'T BECAUSE THEFIRE OBVIOUSLY. SO THIS IS A GREAT GREAT YOU KNOW QUICK FIX TO THE TO THE ISSUE. AND WITH THAT WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR ABOUT. VERY GOOD ANY OTHER OUT WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON TIM VALDERRAMA WITH WEIDEMANN GROUP ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY HEALTH SYSTEM PHARMACISTS. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY AT THE OUTSET THAT WE SUPPORT THE GOAL OF THIS BILL AND THE PREVIOUS BILL WHICH IS TO BRING PHARMACY SERVICES TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES -- WE ALSO SUPPORT ALL THE WORK THAT PHARMACY TECHNICIANS DO AND WE HAVE PHARMACY TECHNICIANS AS MEMBERS OF OUR ASSOCIATION -- HAVING SAID THAT WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL AS DRAFTED ALLOWS THE PHARMACY TECHNICIAN WITH A HIGH SCHOL DIPLOMA AND THE TRAINING COURSE -- IN ADDITION TO LESS THAN HALF A YEAR OF EXPERIENCE -- TO BASICALLY OPERATE IN A REMOTE DISPENSING SITE WITH NO LINE OF SIGHT SUPERVISION -- WE DO HAVE LANGUAGE THAT WE'VE SHARED WITH THE SPONSOR AND THE AUTHOR -- WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH AN UP WITH THEM ON THAT THE PRINCIPAL THING WE'D LIKE TO SEE HAS MORE EXPERIENCE AND WE'D LIKE TO SEE SOME OF THAT EXPERIENCE -- BE IN THE RETAIL PHARMACY SETTING -- HAVING SAID THAT I HEAR THAT THERE MAY BE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WITH THE SPONSOR AND THE BOARD OF PHARMACY. WE LOOK FORWARD TO PARTICIPATING IN THE UP IN THOSE AND WE HOPEFULLY -- CAN RESOLVE THIS MATTER. VERY GOOD ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ART CINEMA BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS SENATOR PAT. THANK YOU AND I WANT THANK YOU -- THE MEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY FOR BRAINS BUILT FORD CERTAINLY SUPPORT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THE BILL -- I DID DID HAVE TWO QUESTIONS ONE AND AND MAYBE IT'S MORE APPROPRIATE FOR THE BOARD WHY IS IT TAKING THE BOARD SO LONG TO ADOPT SO WHY DO WE NEED TO DO A BILL ALL -- I MEAN I KNOW YOU'RE DOING THE BILL BECAUSE THE BOARD HAS ACTED IN. UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN THIS HAPPEN WHERE AN AGENCY. FOR SOME REASON CANNOT SEEM TO PROMULGATE REGULATIONS AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION. IS ACTUALLY IS THE ISSUE ABOUT THE LIKE THE TRAINING SO ONE THOUSAND HOURS APPROXIMATELY FOR A LITTLE OVER FOUR MONTHS FULL TIME -- AND THAT WE'RE HEARING MAYBE SIX MONTHS IS MORE APPROPRIATE SO PERHAPS -- WE CAN ADDRESS SO WHY. ENTER A TERMS OF AND FRANKLY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT'S LESS ABOUT HOW MUCH TIME YOU TAKE OFF AS FAR AS BEING ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE CERTAIN SET OF COMPETENCIES BUT MAYBE CAN SPEAK TO THAT AS WELL SO WE WILL START OFF WITH THE BOARD QUESTION LIKE. WHITE WHY CAN'T THE BOARD IN TWO YEARS GET THE REGULATIONS OUT. CERTAINLY MISSY JOHNSON HERE -- I'D LIKE TO SAY THE ISSUE HASN'T BEEN WITH THE BOARD OF PHARMACY THE BOARD OF PHARMACY DEVELOP THE LANGUAGE IT HAS BEEN LANGUISHING OVER THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS -- WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN HOLDING? REGULATIONS NOT JUST FOR THE BOARD OF PHARMACY BUT FOR ALL REGULATORY BOARDS -- IN A PRE REVIEW PROCESS AND NOT HIS SLOW DOWN THE THE PROCESS THE REGULATORY PROCESS SIGNIFICANTLY THE BOARD JUST TO BE CLEAR THE BOARD OF PHARMACY APPROVE THIS LANGUAGE ON FEBRUARY SIXTH. TWENTY EIGHTEEN THEY SUBMITTED IT TO DC A IN JUNE OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND DCA BEGAN A FORMAL REVIEW PROCESS IN AUGUST OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO THERE'S A HOLD UP OVER AT THE DEPARTMENT ITSELF AND NOT WITH THE BOARD. AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE WENT TO THE AUTHOR OF THE PREVIOUS BILLING ASTOR IF YOU BE WILLING TO CARRY LEGISLATION TO EXPEDITED AS YOU'RE LIKELY AWARE. THAT REGULATORY PROCESS EVEN WENT OUT THIS PRE REVIEW PROCESS CAN TAKE UP TO TWO YEARS SO HAD WE GONE THROUGH THAT AND THEN GONE THROUGH THE ENTIRE PROCESS WE WOULD BE THREE OR FOUR YEARS OUT BEFORE THIS WERE TO BE IMPLEMENTED. OKAY AND THEN I WAS STILL YOUR SECOND QUESTION RELATED TO THE HOURS I'M SORRY DOCTOR PAN -- WE ARE TALKING ABOUT INCREASING THOSE HOURS ARE PROBABLY GOING TO GO UP TO TWO THOUSAND WE'RE JUST WAITING TO GET FINAL APPROVAL FROM THE BOARD BECAUSE THIS IS LANGUAGE THAT I DID DEVELOP. OKAY AND I APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH. ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND I AND SO. YOU SOUND LIKE FIFTEEN HUNDRED IS WHAT YOU ARE SUGGESTING IT SIX MONTHS BUT WILL BE YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT OKAY SO I UNDERSTAND BUT I GUESS THEY COME AND I WOULD JUST MAKE ABOUT THAT. THIS IS THE COMMITTEE OVERSEES THE CA AS WELL AND PERHAPS WE THROUGHOUT TO BE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE PASS LAWS AND WE WE VOTED FOR YOUR PREVIOUS BILL. THE MEMBER AND NOW TWO YEARS LATER IT'S NOT BE IMPLEMENTED SO -- SO I THINK WE I THINK THAT'S PERHAPS THE ISSUE OF FOR OVERSIGHT TO SAY. A WORD AND WE WORK HARD WE BRING IN PUBLIC AND DOWN THE KEYS AND AND YET WE'RE NOT SEEN BILLS IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE THEY'RE STUCK IN THE AND I ALSO WANT TO GIVE THE SPACE FOR THE REGULATORY PROCESS RIGHT WE SHOULD HAVE TO LEGISLATE EVERY DETAIL. SO I SO THE TO MEET A VERY DISTURBED ABOUT THAT AND HOPE THAT PERHAPS THE CHAIR MIGHT HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT -- AND MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO MOVE TO BUILD AND VERY GOOD -- A COUPLE THINGS ONE IS IS THAT -- IT DOES COME IN THIS TRANSITION OF ADMINISTRATIONS. AND AS MUCH AS I SHARE. CENTER YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE DELAY I DO. I ALSO ONE AT THE GRACIOUS AND SENSITIVE TO THE NEW ADMINISTRATION THAT IS NOW TAKING OVER AND TO GIVE THEM THE SPACE IN THE ROOM TO TRY TO GET IT RIGHT. AND GET IT BETTER. AD BUT IT DOES HAVE MY ATTENTION AS WELL I APPRECIATE YOUR OBSERVATION -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WILL CENTER HELENA GO TO YOU AND THEN I HAVE ANOTHER COMMENT. HELLO THANK YOU FINISH IF YOU LIKE. YOUR LIGHTS ON WHY IT IS AS TRUE. RICHARD YEARS AS WELL BUT I JUST WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON ON SENATOR PANTS COMMENTED IN YOURS -- THAT MISTER CHAIR THAT THAT THE DCA HAS HISTORICALLY DELAYED REGULATIONS AND THROUGH THEIR BUREAUCRATIC. NONSENSE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STALL THESE PROCESS THESE TO A OF AN OBNOXIOUS LEVEL. THAT IS PUT CONSUMERS IN HARM'S WAY. THAT HAS LEFT US ALL IN A VERY DIFFICULT POSITION NOW LIKE GRANTED THAT THE NEW ADMINISTRATION HAS SOME TIME NOW TO MAKE SOME CHANGES AND HOPEFULLY THEY MAKE SOME SERIOUS. CHANGES IN THAT -- THAT AGENCY AND IN IN THE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN HISTORIC AND IT IS UNACCEPTABLE AND THIS. COMMITTEE AND I THINK THIS SENATE NEEDS TO TAKE SOME ACTION TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT. THANK YOU VERY GOOD SENATOR HELL HOW DO YOU REALLY FEEL. NOW YOUR AREA -- COMMENTS ARE WELL TAKEN AYE I ONCE AGAIN THANK THAT THAT WE WANT TO GIVE THE NEW ADMINISTRATION AND ABILITY TO DO THINGS BETTER. BUT I THINK WE'RE ALL GOING TO WATCH IT VERY CLOSELY. YOU TAKE THOSE COMMENTS TO HEART. I WANTED TO CIRCLE BACK ON THE ISSUE OF THAT THE TRAINING TIME. OUT ITS PROPOSED IN THE BILL AS AT A THOUSAND HOURS -- A IN THAT AND THEN THE DRAFT REGULATIONS THAT WERE PUT FORWARD AS YOU'RE WAITING FOR APPROVAL -- HOW MANY HOURS ARE SPECIFIED IN THAT IN THOSE DRAFT REGULATIONS IT'S ONE THOUSAND RIGHT? WERE THERE ANY OBJECTIONS THAT WERE PROVIDED BY ANY PARTY TO THE THAT THE ISSUE OF A THOUSAND HOURS DURING THE REGULATORY PROCESS. I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY OBJECTION SO THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE HEARING ABOUT TODAY AND I APPRECIATE THAT. HEARING THAT SURE WE ALL DO. I WAS NOT AN ISSUE THAT THROUGH THAT WITH THAT. SIX MONTHS ONE YEAR PROCESS NO ONE'S RAISED ANY ISSUE OF IT UNTIL. THE BILL IS PROPOSES COME BEFORE US THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING TO BE CLEAR THAT'S WHAT BOARD STAFF HAS INDICATED TO ME SO I DON'T HAVE COMPLETE KNOWLEDGE OF THAT BUT THAT'S WHAT I WAS TOLD WELL THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE INFORMATION THAT I'VE RECEIVED IN MY COMMITTEE AS WELL -- DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE OPEN TO TO EXAMINING THAT MORE CAREFULLY UNDERSTANDING WHY.

THAT LEADS US -- ITEM NUMBER SIX ASSEMBLY BILL SEVEN FOURTEEN BY SOMETHING NUMBER WOULD WELCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SARAH AND TAKE THE OPTION PERCENT -- AB SEVEN FOURTEEN AB SEVEN FOURTEEN IS AN IMPORTANT FOLLOW A BILL TO AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY OF LAST YEAR THE REQUIRES PRESCRIBERS OF YOU OFFER A CO PRESCRIPTION OF NALOXONE WERE. ANOTHER FDA APPROVED OPIOID OVERDOSE REVERSAL DRUG WHENEVER THEY OFFER AN OPIATE OR BENZODIAZEPINE A PRESCRIPTION TO SPECIFIC CATEGORIES OF AT RISK PATIENTS. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK IN EXCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED AMENDMENT RELATING TO THE EXEMPTION OF VETERINARIANS WE NEVER INTENDED FOR THIS TO APPLY TO VETERINARIANS -- ADDITIONALLY I WILL WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS ON THE SUGGESTION RELATED TO THE DELEGATION. EDUCATION COMPONENT OF THE BILL HOWEVER I FEEL VERY STRONGLY -- THE THAT ONE OF THE PRIMARY REASONS THE PRESCRIPTION OPIOID CRISIS EXISTS THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY IS A PRESCRIBERS OF WHICH I AM. ONE OF FAILED IN THEIR DUTY TO THEIR PATIENTS BY NOT ENGAGING AND MEANINGFUL DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE RISK OF OPIOIDS ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADDICTION AND THE DANGER OF OPIOID ABUSE. OR OVERDOSE EXCUSE ME -- WHILE IT MAY BE MORE CONVENIENT TO DELEGATE THE DISCUSSION AND EDUCATION COMPONENT THIS BILL TO OTHER MEMBERS OF THE HEALTHCARE TEAM I CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT. UBER SHOULD HELP TURN THIS EPIDEMIC AROUND BY HAVING THOSE DIFFICULT BUT CRITICAL CONVERSATIONS WITH THEIR PATIENTS REGARDING THIS LIFE THREATENING ISSUE. HAVING SAID THAT I BELIEVE AB SEVEN FOURTEEN IS AN IMPORTANT BILL TO PROVIDE CLARIFICATION AND A COUPLE OF IMPORTANT EXEMPTIONS -- A. B. AT SEVEN FOURTEEN PROVIDES AN EXEMPTION FOR PRESCRIBERS WHEN TREATING TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS -- WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION A LOCK SO MAYBE CONTRA INDICATED? IT CLARIFIES EXACTLY WHEN THE OFFER TO OF A CO PRESCRIPTION OF CLARIFIES THAT IS NOT REQUIRED WHEN THE DRUGS IN QUESTION ARE ORDERED OR ADMINISTERED TO A PATIENT WELL UNDER THE DIRECT MEDICAL. CARE. IN IN IN OR OUT PATIENTS SAID SETTING THE COOPER IS ONLY MEANT TO BE MADE. WHEN A PRESCRIPTION IS GIVEN TO A PATIENT TO FILL ON THEIR OWN -- AB SOME FOURTEEN PROVIDE CLARITY AND SPECIFICITY TO THE REQUIREMENTS AND ENSURES THAT THE APPROPRIATE EXEMPTIONS FOR CO PRESCRIBING ARE IN PLACE. AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK DR -- THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR BRINGING THIS GOOD BILL TO US TODAY ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT STEP UP TO THE MICROPHONE.
