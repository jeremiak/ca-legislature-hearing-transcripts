THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES AB TWO FIFTEEN SIX TO IMPROVE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR CITIES WHERE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN UNDERPERFORMING TO ADDRESS A HOUSING CRISIS ARE LEGISLATURE IN RECENT YEARS HAS MADE CLEAR THAT HOUSING PRODUCTION IS A PRIORITY BY OVERHAULING THE HOUSING ELEMENT PROCESS TO ENSURE THE LOCAL POLICIES ALIGN WITH THE STATE'S GOAL OF SUPPORTING HOUSING PRODUCTION WHILE PROVIDING CITIES AND COUNTIES THE FLEXIBILITY TO FIND STRATEGIES THAT WORK. THIS BILL WOULD MAINTAIN THAT LOCAL FLEXIBILITY BUT ENSURE THAT LOCAL PLANS ARE EFFECTIVE IN PRODUCING HOUSING IT INCREASES ACCOUNTABILITY IN THREE WAYS FIRST REQUIRE CITIES TO HAVE A MID CYCLE CONSULTATION WITH EACH CD IF OVERALL OR FOR A HOUSING PRODUCTION HAS BEEN UNDER THE REGIONAL AVERAGE AT THE CONSULTATION CITIES IN EACH CITY WILL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THE HOUSING ELEMENT IS BEING IMPLEMENTED APPROPRIATELY AND REVISING. STRATEGIES THAT ARE NOT WORKING. THE SECOND WAY IS AT THE BILL REQUIRES A CITY WHERE PRODUCTION HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW THE REGIONAL AVERAGE TO DROP LOCAL POLICIES THAT ENABLE IT TO ACHIEVE EIGHT CITIES PRO HOUSING DESIGNATION. LASTLY THE BUILDING ADDS THE HOUSING CRISIS ACT OF TWENTY NINETEEN. TO THE LIST OF STATE HOUSING LAWS THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAN ENFORCE. THESE THREE STRATEGIES WILL BETTER ENSURE THE ALIGNMENT OF STATE AND LOCAL GOALS FOR THE CREATION OF HOUSING. AT ALL INCOME LEVELS AND THIS BILL SUPPORTEDBY WIDE COALITION OF HOUSING ADVOCATES. OF AFFORDABLE AS WELL AS HOUSING INDUSTRY INTERESTS AND WITH THAT WILL TURN IT OVER TO A WITNESS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN YOUR WITNESS MAY SPEAK.

BUILDING ON THE EFFORTS OF AB SEVENTY TWO FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICH WE ALSO CO SPONSORED AB TWO FIFTEEN TAKES ANOTHER IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS ENSURING EVERY REGION. IS MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS MEETING THEIR HOUSING GOALS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU NOTED AB TWO FIFTEEN MAINTAINS THAT LOCAL FLEXIBILITY. BUT INCREASES OVERSIGHT TO ENSURE THAT LOCAL PLANS ARE EFFECTIVE IN PRODUCING HOUSING. THIS LEGISLATION WILL NOT ONLY IMPROVE THE STATE'S ABILITY TO KEEP TABS ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION IT WILL ALSO OFFER TIMELY TARGETED SUPPORT TO JURISDICTIONS FALLING BEHIND THEIR HOUSING GOALS TARGETS. HELPING EVERY COMMUNITY STAY ON TRACK TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING CALIFORNIA NEEDS. FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE JUST SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY OTHER.

AND WE KNOW THAT EACH CD ALREADY HAD SIGNIFICANT AUTHORITY TO OVERSEE HOUSING ELEMENT ADOPTION IMPLEMENTATION AND LOCAL AGENCIES THAT ARE OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS CAN BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FINES WHAT WE DO OBJECT TO WITH THIS BILL AND THE NEW PROCESS CREATED FOR THIS MID CYCLE CONSULTATION WE THINK THIS IS REDUNDANT OF THE EXISTING AUTHORITY THAT EACH CD ALREADY HAS BUT WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED THAT IT'S POORLY TARGETED- WE FEEL THAT ESPECIALLY IN THE UNINCORPORATED COUNTY AREAS WHICH TEND TO BE LESS. ECONOMICALLY ROBUST IN HAVE WEAKER HOUSING MARKETS THEY'RE LIKELY TO BE CAUGHT UP IN THIS PROCESS JUST BY VIRTUE OF THAT WEAKER MARKET THAT EXIST OUT THERE RATHER THAN FOCUSING THE OVERSIGHT ON JURISDICTIONS THAT MAY BE ACTIVELY OBSTRUCTING HOUSING DEVELOPMENT FOR OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR OBLIGATIONS WE ALSO WERE TO OBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS- OF. ATTAINING THE PRO HOUSING- POLICY DESIGNATION BY EIGHT CD THIS WHOLE PROGRAM WAS SET UP ON A PREMISE OF BEING AN INCENTIVE BASED ON STRUCTURE AND NOW IT'S GOING TO BE CREATED AS A MANDATE FOR THIS SUBSET OF JURISDICTIONS BEFORE WE EVEN KNOW WHAT THE- POLICIES LOOK LIKE THE REGULATIONS FOR THIS PROGRAM HAVE NOT YET BEEN RELEASED ON THAT ALSO CREATES OBVIOUSLY A PRACTICAL CONCERN FOR US. WHEN WE COMMENTED BACK IN TWENTY NINETEEN ON THE SRT OF A ROUGH DRAFT THAT WAS PUT OUT BY THE DEPARTMENT WE IDENTIFIED CONCERNS ABOUT MAKING SURE IT'S SUCH A PROGRAM WAS GOING TO BE APPLICABLES ESPECIALLY FOR RURAL IN UNINCORPORATED JURISDICTIONS- AND CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE CONCERNS GIVEN THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE FINAL RULES.

RIGHT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- AND I WANT TO START BY THINKING THAT. MADAM CHAIRWOMAN FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS BILL- HAD THIS BILL LAST YEAR AND YOU MADE THE COMMITMENT THEN TO HELP ME. WORK THROUGH THIS AND- I THINK WE FOUND A GOOD PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WE CAN MOVE FOR THIS CAN BE VERY HELPFUL- AB THIRTY SIX. WOULD HELP THE TOWN OF PARADISE. RECOVER FROM THE DEVASTATING IMPACTS OF THE CAMPFIRE. AND I WANT TO REPORT TO YOU TO THE COMMITTEE MANY OF YOU- SEVERAL YOU CAME UP TO PARADISE- IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF GREAT PROGRESS- JUST GOT NOTICE YESTERDAY THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTIETH. HOME WAS REBUILT- IN PARADISE- YESTERDAY- AND SO. THEY'RE MAKING GOOD PROGRESS THERE'S STILL A LONG WAY TO GO OF COURSE AND- AND ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES THERE IS IT INFRASTRUCTURE AND- AND AS WE REBUILD SAFER. AND MORE RESILIENT- IN THE TOWN- SEWER IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT- ONE OF THINGS THEY'RE LOOKING AS IF THEY CAN HAVE THAT SEWER IN THE- IN THE DOWNTOWN. CORRIDOR STYLE ACTUALLY HELP- ALLOW FOR MORE DENSE. DEVELOPMENT ALONG THE EVACUATION. FOUR DOORS WHICH ARE BEING IMPROVED- AND IN ADDITION TO HELPING THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY- OF COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT THERE IN THE IN THE CORE- SO AB THIRTY SIX WOULD ALLOW FOR. YOUR DESIGN BUILD- PROCUREMENT. FOR THE SEWER AND WATER INFRASTRUCTURE A SEWER WATER PIPELINE- AND IT'S ALSO PART OF A REGIONAL PLAN THAT IS BEING LOOKED INTO RIGHT NOW- TO CONNECT THE SEWER TO A REGIONAL PLAN IN CHICO- AND ALSO TO HAVE A WATER PIPELINE THAT CAN BE USED. TO HELP CERTAINLY PARADISE BUT ALSO THE REGION IN TERMS OF MEETING ITS WATER GOALS AND WATER STEWARDSHIP- MEETING GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY GOALS- SO WHAT IT DOES IS IT PROVIDES THAT DESIGN BUILD PROCUREMENT A LITTLE UPDATE ON WHERE THEY ARE WITH THIS RIGHT NOW THE TOWN. HAS DECIDED TO PROCEED WITH THE REGIONAL OPTION CONNECTING WITH THE CITY OF CHICO'S WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT. PROJECT IS CURRENTLY IN PHASE TWO WHICH INCLUDES ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. AS SO THAT WILL BE GOING TO THERE'S GOING TO BE PUBLIC. COMMENT PUBLIC REVIEWS PUBLIC MEETINGS. AND THEN PHASE THREE OF THE PROJECT WHICH INCLUDES THE DESIGN PROCUREMENT IS PLANNED AND PROJECTED FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWO. SO THE WATER PIPELINE IS ANOTHER CRITICAL PROJECT SEPARATE FROM THE SEWER. THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM DESIGN BUILD AUTHORITY THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE BOTH IN HERE. THE PARADISE YOU'RE A GEISHA DISTRICT WHICH IS THE WATER DISTRICT- PROVIDES DRINKING WATER SERVICE TO THE TOWN AND IT LOST MOST OF ITS RATEPAYER BASE. I DO THE CAMPFIRE MANY OF YOUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT YOU REALIZE THAT'S HE SAW THE SAME COST OF OPERATING THE SYSTEM- BUT OBVIOUSLY NOT THE SAME REVENUE- WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE PROVIDED TWO YEARS WORTH OF BACK FILL TO THE DISTRICT TO HELP THEM GET THROUGH. THE LONG TERM THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO BE ABLE TO TRANSFER WATER. REGIONALLY WITHIN BUTTE COUNTY. TO HELP SUPPORT- CHICO- IN THE SURROUNDING AREAS- AND YOU COUNTY BUT ALSO THEN ALSO SUPPORT A REVENUE STREAM FOR THE TOWN AS A AS THEIR REBUILDING THEY WILL KEEP GET BACK TO. YOU ALL RIGHT RATEPAYER BASE- AND BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THEMSELVES ECONOMICALLY- SO THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT BILL BE VERY HELPFUL. AS THEY ARE MOVING FOR THIS TO BE A GREAT TOOL AND HELP THEM TO BUILD THESE PROJECTS- IN A TIMELY FASHION- AND- IN A MORE COST EFFECTIVE WAY AS WE KNOW THE DESIGN BUILD. BUT ALSO AS WE DO WITH MANY OF THESE BILLS PROVIDE FOR SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE- INITIALLY WE HAVE LOCAL PEOPLE. WORKING ON THIS ON THIS PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT. AND THAT PEOPLE ARE AND SKILLED AND PEOPLE ARE GETTING TRAINED- IN ADDITION GETTING THAT YOU KNOW A LOT OF US TALK ABOUT THAT C. T. AND WANTING TO HAVE. RAIN PEOPLE TO LEARN A TRADING AND GET INTO THE TRADES FOR THAT SUSTAINABLE- LIFE. GOING FORWARD SO. MANY GOOD THINGS THAT THIS THIS BILL PROVIDES- REALLY WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT AND HERE TO TESTIFY. IN FAVOR OF THE BILL IS KEVIN PHILLIPS- FROM. THE TOWN MANAGER PARADISE. AND ANDREW MEREDITH ON BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'LL FIGHT WILL TAKE THE FIRST- SUPPORT WITNESSED FROM THE GALLERY HERE LIKE TO SPEAK. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIRPERSON ON BEHALF OF THE HALF MILLION MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL WE ARE PROUD TO BE A CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. AS YOU'RE ALL AWARE THE CAMPFIRE HAD A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY IN PARADISE AND BUTTE COUNTY AS A WHOLE. WELL OUR MEMBERS ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN REBUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PARADISE REBUILDING THE COMMUNITY ITSELF HAS PROVEN TO BE MORE DIFFICULT. THE CAMPFIRE LEFT BEHIND THE COMMUNITY IN DIRE NEED OF OPTIONS FOR SEWER TREATMENT AND ABUNDANCE OF COMMITTED WATER RESOURCES WITHOUT A CUSTOMER BASE. TO DELIVER IT TO. AS MENTIONED BEFORE THE CAMPFIRE PARADISE WAS THE LARGEST INCORPORATED CITY IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT A SEWER TREATMENT SYSTEM. NEW STANDARDS FOR SEPTIC SYSTEMS HAVE MADE MANY RESIDENTIAL LOTS AND BUILDABLE AT THE MOMENT. THIS IS DRAMATICALLY SLOWED THE REBUILDING OF PARADISE. WITHOUT A MUNICIPAL SEWER OPTION IT COULD TAKE DECADES TO FULLY REBUILD THE COMMUNITY. EVEN WORSE WITHOUT OPTIONS THAT ALLOW FOR THE PARADISE REGULATION DISTRICT TO REMAIN SOLVENT. WE COULD SUDDENLY LOSE THEM AS WELL. P. IDEA PLEASE MEMBERS OF TEAMSTERS LOCAL ONE THIRTY SEVEN MANY OF WHOM LOST HOMES IN THE CAMPFIRE. IF WE LOSE P. ID MANY GOOD PAYING MIDDLE CLASS UNION JOBS WILL BE LOST. WE FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT AB THIRTY SIX PROVIDES OPTIONS FOR BOTH THE TOWN OF PARADISE. IN P. ID THAT WILL HELP TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF THE CAMPFIRE. IF STUDIES SHOW A PIPELINE FROM PARADISE IS FEASIBLE TO CONNECT BOTH PLDT WILLING BUYER AND THE TOWN OF PARADISE TO REGIONAL SEWER PLANT. AB THIRTY SIX LET THEM HIT THE GROUND RUNNING. DESIGN BUILD MODELS WILL ENSURE. ENABLE A CONTRACTOR TO BE SELECTED IN BEGIN IMPORTANT WORK WELL BEFORE SHOVEL HITS THE DIRT. YOU'LL ALSO TYPES GOLDENTREE PROVISIONS. TO THE PROPOSED PROJECT WE BELIEVE AB THIRTY SIX IS IMPORTANT WE BELIEVE IT IS NECESSARY AND WE BELIEVE IT. BUT THE TIMING IS IMPORTANT. WE ARE DRIVERS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR MEREDITH NOW WILL HAVE KEVIN PHILLIPS FROM THE TOWN OF PARADISE I BELIEVE HE'S ON THE PHONE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU AND TO ASK YOU TO CONTINUE THE SUPPORT FOR THE TOWN OF PARADISE AND IS RECOVERING AFTER- IN ORDER TO MOVE FORWARD WITH OUR RETAIL. WE NEED TO UPDATE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IN PARTICULAR SEWER COLLECTION SYSTEM AND TREATMENT SYSTEM IS CRITICAL TO ATTRACTING BUSINESSES BACK. AND SUPPORTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE ARE MOVING FORWARD AGGRESSIVELY ON IMPLEMENTING THE PARIS OR PROJECT IN ITS MOST ECONOMICAL AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY MANNER POSSIBLE CURRENTLY WE ARE PREPARING THE ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS NEEDED TO OBTAIN CLEARANCES AND PERMITS. FOR THE PROJECT DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION. THE GEISHA DISTRICT IS ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF WORKING THROUGH AN OPTION STUDY LOOKING AT OPTIONS TO STAY FISCALLY SOLVENT. ONE OF THESE OPTIONS INCLUDE DINNER TYPE PRODUCT PIPELINE WITH THE CITY OF CHICO TO DELIVER POSSIBLE WATER TO THE CITY. THIS WOULD HELP WITH GROUND WATER ISSUES IN THE VALLEY AND KEEP THE IRRIGATION DISTRICTS OFTEN THROUGH THE REBUILD PROCESS. AB THIRTY SIX WOULD AUTHORIZE THE USE OF DESIGN BUILD DELIVERY METHOD FOR THE PARADISE OR AND THE PHP INTERPROCESS JECT. DESIGN BUILD AT THE PROCUREMENT METHOD THAT BOTH THE DESIGNER AND BUILDER WORKING TOGETHER. EARLY IN THE PROCESS AND ALLOWS THE INNOVATION IMPROVEMENT DESIGN FEATURES THAT ARE AVAILABLE. WHICH CAN PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS IN COMPARISON THE DESIGN BUILD NOT THAT. THE DESIGN BID BUILD METHODS WHILE EFFECTIVE DOES DOES NOT BRING THE THINKERS AND DOERS TOGETHER IN THE SAME MANNER. TO WORK OUT WORK OUT ISSUES IN COMPLEX THAT DESIGN BUILD IS A METHOD THAT CAN PROVE TIME SAVINGS AS WELL AS COST SAVINGS WHICH ARE TWO THINGS THE TOWN NEEDS. TO GET A RECOVERY MOVING QUICKLY RECOGNIZING THAT THE- LEGISLATURE LEGISLATOR HAD PREVIOUSLY ENACTED THIS LEGISLATION AUTHORIZING THE USE A BILL. DESIGNED ALL BURKE ABOUT THEIR COMMUNITIES WE URGE THIS CAN GET COMMITTEE TOO FAR. AND I VOTE ON THE ASSEMBLY BILL. THIRTY SIX YOU.

WELCOME THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON- THAT ENSURE A MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR OF AND THE COMMITTEE FOR. THEIR WORK ON THIS AND I FEEL THE- WORKING AT THE VERY STAKEHOLDERS I HAVE COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED TO ME INCLUDING ONE. I BEGAN TO WORK WITH THE STATE WATER BOARD ON HOW THEY CAN IMPLEMENT A REGIONAL SOLUTION TO ADDRESSING SAFE DRINKING WATER IN SOUTHERN L. A. COUNTY. TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A REGIONAL AND LOCAL CLAPPER CONSOLIDATION OF FAILING SMALL WATER AGENCIES WHERE THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE FOR SUSTAINABLE DRINKING WATER SYSTEM IN OUR REGION. L. LASKO HAS SOME IDEAS. FOR HOW OUR ALLEY LASKO MAY BE ABLE TO PLAY AN ACTIVE ROLE IN CONSULTING CONSOLIDATIONS. AND WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM. AS WELL COLLABORATION WITH REGIONAL WATER LEADERS NUMBER THREE OR COLLABORATING WITH REGIONAL WATER HEATERS. TEN IF I IDENTIFY MEMBERS OF THE TECHNICAL ADVISORY BOARD. YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM OF THAT OR IF THEY GOT BODIES THEY DS. AB LATE ELEVEN NINETY FIVE WOULD BRING STATE WATER BOARD ATTENTION TO ONE OF THE STATE'S REGIONAL HOT SPOTS WITH SMALL WATER SYSTEMS. THAT ARE PROBLEMS PROVIDING THEIR COMMUNITIES AS SAFE DRINKING WATER. RAISE THE BAR TO CREATE A POSITION TITLE COMMISSIONER. FOR THE SOUTHERN L. A. COUNTY REGION THE COMMISSIONER WILL LEAD REGIONAL COLLABORATIONS TO DEVELOP A PLAN. FOR SUSTAINABLE DRINKING WATER WHICH MAY INCLUDE CONSOLIDATION OF SOME SMALL AGENCIES. THE COMMISSIONER ALSO WILL PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND FUNDING AND LEAD EFFORTS TO FIX PROBLEMS AND OF WITH CONTAMINATED GROUNDWATER. FINALLY THE COMMISSIONER WILL EXERCISE OVERSIGHT OVER THE CENTRAL BASIN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT IN ORDER TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY IN OPERATIONS OR PASSED EIGHT AUDITS HAVE REVEALED PROBLEMS. SINCE THE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WATER BOND THAT WE HAVE FOCUSED OUR ATTENTION ON FIXING WATER SYSTEMS THAT HAVE DIFFICULTY PROVIDING SAFE DRINKING WATER TO CALIFORNIANS. THE STATE WATER BOARDS RECENT STATEWIDE NEEDS ASSESSMENTS ON SAFE DRINKING WATER IDENTIFIED L. A. COUNTY AS AMONG THE TOP BY COUNTY THIS MALL WATER SYSTEMS AT RISK OF FAILURE. EVERYTHING YOU SEE OTHER REPORT HIGHLIGHTED THE FACT THAT THE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS THAT ARE FEELING ON THE VERGE OF FAILING ARE CONCENTRATED IN SOUTHERN L. A. COUNTY. AB ELEVEN NINETY FIVE CONNECTS RESOURCES FROM THE WATER BOARD DIRECTLY TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND SMALL WATER SYSTEMS. THE BILL AUTHORIZES THE FORMATION OF A TECHNICAL ADVISORY BOARD AND THE BOARD WILL INCLUDE WATER EXPERTS ON THE REGION QUALIFY TO DEVELOP AND OFFER SOLUTIONS TO WATER. COMMISSIONERS.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER- WILL MOVE ON TO YOUR SUPPORT AND I BELIEVE THE CITIZENS. MISTER ORTEGA. FOR THE CALPERS HOSTED MUTUAL YEAH COMMITTEE AT AFTERNOON WELCOME. YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRPERSON OF OUR CURRY VICE CHAIR LACKEY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME THAT I DON'T THINK I'M TESTIFYING IN MY CAPACITY AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF MUTUAL WATER COMPANIES RECOGNIZING THAT AB ELEVEN NINETY FIVE IS A WORK OF PROGRESS I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA PROVIDING NEEDED TESTIFYING FOR HER STEADY FOCUS ON SMALL WATER SYSTEM ISSUES IN CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHEAST L. A. IN PARTICULAR. WE HAVE FAITH IN ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA'S WORK ON EIGHT ELEVEN NINETY FIVE THAT IS BRINGING STAKEHOLDERS IN SOUTHEAST DELHI TOGETHER MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT SENATOR DODD BROUGHT STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND CENTRAL COAST TOGETHER PASSED IN SB TWO HUNDRED IN THE SAFER PROGRAM UNDER THE STATE WATER BOARD. UNLIKE THE CENTRAL VALLEY URBAN AREAS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NOW HAVE REGIONAL WATER AGENCIES POSITION TO HELP SMALL WATER SYSTEMS AB ELEVEN NINETY FIVE COULD REMOVE OBSTACLES AND DELAYS THESE REGIONAL AGENCIES FACE AND HELP BETTER LEVERAGE STATE DOLLARS. AB ELEVEN NINETY FIVE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER CONSORTIUM COULD BE A SUCCESSFUL FOLLOW UP TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MIKE GIPSON AB FIFTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THAT HELP TO DISSOLVE THE CITY BUT COUNTY WATER DISTRICT AND HELP LOS ANGELES COUNTY AS ADMINISTRATOR TO FORMULATE LONG TERM A LONG TERM PLAN TO HELP TO KEEP THIS RESIDENTS ATTAIN GOOD WATER QUALITY AND SERVICE AT A REASONABLE COST. WE ARE RECOMMENDED TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA THAT THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER COLLABORATIVE'S ADVISORY COMMITTEE LEVERAGE WHAT WE LEARNED FROM THE CITY OF EXPERIENCE AND INCLUDE TECHNICAL PROFESSIONALS FROM THE ENTITIES THAT ENCOMPASS THE SCOPE OF AUTHORITY AND RESOURCES NEEDED IN CASES LIKE TO TEVA AS WELL AS IN HELPING LESS SEVERELY IMPAIRED SYSTEM. FOR THE SAKE OF TIME ALL I WILL NOT GO TO THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE'RE SUGGESTING WE ARE EAGER TO REVIEW LANGUAGE PROVIDED BY STAKEHOLDERS IN THE AREA AS WELL AS THE STATE WATER BOARD ADDRESSING WATER RIGHT THE REALITY IS THAT WHILE SOME INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES CHARGE HIGHER WATER RATES ONE COMPANY IN PARTICULAR CHARGES THE LOWEST WATER RATES IN CENTRAL BASIN. WELL HAVING WATER RIGHTS AND THE CENTRAL BASIN IS A KEY COMPONENT OF AFFORDABILITY IMPORTED WATER RATES. ARE WOULD DRIVE THE COST OF WATER UP WORDS TO CONSUME AND SENT BASIN. WITH REGARDS TO CAN. SPEAKER AB TWO. A MY GARCIA AB FLIGHTS INFO ASSEMBLYMEMBERS. OF THE B. FIFTY FOUR. BACK GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY FOR- TO NOT FOR PROFIT MUTUAL WATER COMPANIES I REPRESENT. EITHER OF YOU ARE IN THE STATE WATER BOARD HAVE ALSO DEVISED RICHMOND TRICKS OR SMALL WATER SYSTEMS. THAT'S WE SUPPORT EFFORTS TO CREATE METRICS FOR OTHER TYPES OF WATER AGENCIES SO THAT REMEDIES FOR ADDRESSING ISSUES ABOUT DEFICIENCIES IN GOVERNANCE FINANCE AND ETHICS. DON'T HAVE TO RESULT IN LEGISLATIVE INTERVENTION AND REPETITIVE STATE AUDITS FOR EXAMPLE SCHOOL DISTRICTS OPERATE UNDER SUCH STANDARDS WOULD DEFINE TRIGGERS THAT RESULT IN THE ASSIGNMENT OF STATE ADMINISTRATORS TO CORRECT DEFICIENCIES WHEN A DISTRICT FALLS BELOW STANDARDS. IN MANY WAYS THE TECHNICAL CAPACITY CREATED FOR SOUTHEAST LOS ANGELES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND- YOU BE ELEVEN NINETY FIVE IN THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER COLLABORATIVE. CAN HELP THE REGION CATCH UP TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN QUALIFYING NEEDS MADE POSSIBLE THROUGH THE SAFER PROGRAM. THAT FEW WOULD DISPUTE HAS MOSTLY FOCUSED ON THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN THE CENTRAL COAST. ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA'S MEETING WITH MANY STAKEHOLDERS IN SOUTHEAST L. AND HIS PLEDGE TO CONSIDER AMENDMENTS TO CALIBRATE THE BILL TO PRESIDENT NEEDS. I BELIEVE THAT THE BILL SHOULD MOVE FORWARD AND LOOK FORWARD. TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU- ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

ON THE DECISION AND IN DOING SO WE'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE QUESTIONS CONCERNS AND SUGGESTIONS. WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA AND HER STAFF AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AND LOOK FORWARD TO ONGOING DIALOGUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M THREE SIXTY ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS IS BOB ZERO ON BEHALF OF THE WATER REPLENISHMENT DISTRICT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WELL WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THE BLL WE'VE HAD VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA AND HER STAFF AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THOSE DISCUSSIONS.

YES GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ALEX ROSS AND I AM GENERAL MANAGER OF THE CENTRAL BASIN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR PROVIDING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO AB ELEVEN NINETY FIVE I ALSO WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLYWOMAN GARCIA FOR TAKING AN INTEREST IN GROUND WATER QUALITY ISSUES IN THE SOUTHEAST LOS ANGELES COUNTY REGION WE SHARE THE GOALS OF THE AUTHOR TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE SAFE DRINKING WATER TO THE SOUTHEAST LOS ANGELES COUNTY REGION IN GENERAL AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN PARTICULAR. HOWEVER CENTRAL BASIN DOES NOT SUPPLY OR TREAT GROUNDWATER THEREFORE IT IS UNCLEAR AS A WHOLE SO IMPORTED WATER UTILITY WHY WE ARE INCLUDED IN THIS BILL. CONSIDERING THAT CENTRAL BASIN AT IMPLEMENTED ALL THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AUDIT. AND OPERATIONALIZE THESE PRACTICES IN OUR ADMINISTRATIVE CODE. ARE INCLUDED IN THE BILL CREATES CONFUSION ABOUT ITS INTENT AND DETRACTS FROM THE VERY REAL ISSUES ON GROUND WATER QUALITY AND THE ONGOING GROUNDWATER TREATMENT NEEDS OF OUR SERVICE AREA. SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY TWO CENTRAL BASIN AS A METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MEMBER AGENCY. HAS DELIVERED HIGH QUALITY CONTAMINANT FREE DRINKING WATER DIRECTLY TO OUR RETAIL WATER SYSTEMS WITHOUT THE NEED FOR COSTS FOR ADDITIONAL TREATMENT. TO ENSURE THE DELIVERY OF SAFE AND RELIABLE WATER. METROPOLITAN OPERATES FIVE WATER TREATMENT PLANT SPOTTED ON GOING BASIS IT TESTS FOR NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED WATER CONSTITUENTS IT PERFORMS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND WATER QUALITY TESTS PER YEAR. CENTRAL BASIN SERVES TWENTY FOUR CITIES. WATER DISTRICTS MITCHELL WATER. INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES A NEARLY TWO MILLION RESIDENTS. WOULD BE DISENFRANCHISED BY AB ELEVEN NINETY FIVE WHICH WE BELIEVE IS A STEP BACKWARDS AND LOCAL GOVERNANCE AND DEMOCRATIC REPRESENTATION. NOT TO MENTION THE UNNECESSARY ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BE PASSED TO THE REPAIRS. AS NOTED BY THE AUTHOR THERE ARE MANY WATER CHALLENGES FACING THE SOUTHEAST LOS ANGELES COUNTY REGION. BUT THE RELIABILITY AND QUALITY OF OUR DRINKING WATER IS NOT ONE OF THEM IN ORDER TO HELP ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES OF GROUNDWATER QUALITY AND STABILITY. WE HUMBLY REQUEST AT THE STATE MORE AGGRESSIVELY FUND PROJECTS THAT IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF DRINKING WATER. SO THAT WE CAN CREATE JOBS IN OUR COMMUNITIES FOR THE BENEFIT OUR COMMUNITIES. CENTRAL BASIN DOES NOT BELIEVE OUR INCLUSION IN AB ELEVEN NINETY FIVE IS APPROPRIATE. AND FOR THESE REASONS WE MUST OPPOSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU I BELIEVE I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO FOR COMFORT CAPITAL. CAN YOU WITH A% CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATION. NAME ONE GOOD AFTERNOON CHARACTER AG WE ARE IN MEMBERS JENNIFER CMPETE ALLOW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA WATER MITIGATION HE W. A.

UNFORTUNATELY THE BILL INCLUDES A PROVISION THAT CREATE A PREFERENCE. FOR A GOVERNMENT RUN WATER SYSTEM OVER ANY OTHER WATER. YOU TO BE ABLE THAT THE STATE LOOK COMING. EVERY OPTION AVAILABLE TO COMMUNITIES SUFFERING FROM CONTAMINATED DRINKING WATER HI RATE FOR BOTH. RATHER THAN CREATE ANY LIMITATION AB CURRENTLY DRAFTED IN AB ELEVEN NINETY FIVE. I PROPOSED IN THE BILL OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT ENTITY WOULD BE STATUTORILY PROHIBITED FROM CONTEMPLATING A PARTNERSHIP WITH ONE OF THE W. EIGHT MEMBERS. EVEN IF THAT WATER SUPPLIER CAN OFFER REASONABLE RATES AND IMPROVE WATER QUALITY CUSTOMER EVAN MY PANELISTS WITH UNSAFE DRINKING WATER TO THIRD TO HAVE EVERY OPTION ON THE TABLE.

GOOD TO WORK THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THE COMMISSIONER WILL LET US KNOW THAT AND HOPEFULLY STATE TO.

VASTLY PARKS THIS BILL DOWN- SO WE'LL GO THROUGH THAT SPEAKS A LOT ABOUT THE SUBSTANCE IT LIMITS THE BILL'S APPLE GIVE WILL APPLICABILITY TO THE MEETINGS OF CITY COUNCILS AND COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ONLY AND ONLY IN THE JURISDICTIONS WHICH CONTAIN A POPULATION OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE OR MORE A QUARTER MILLION PEOPLE. OR INTERNET NOT AND GIVING LOCAL AGENCIES FLEXIBILITY IN IMPLEMENTATION WE ALSO REMOVED LANGUAGE REQUIRED TO A OPERABILITY OF THE FOR INTERNET REDUCING COST REMOVED ALL LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS ENGLISH TRANSLATION AND INTERPRETATION PROVISIONS REMOVED LANGUAGE ALLOWING LOCAL AGENCIES TO REQUIRE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO REGISTER IN ORDER TO RIDE PUBLIC COMMENT AND WE HAVE ADDED A SUNSET DATE FOR DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE. PREJUDICE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WE HAD PREVIOUSLY MADE SUBSTANTIVE AMENDMENTS TO CUT DOWN COSTS BASED ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FEEDBACK SUGGESTS SCALING BACK LANGUAGE TRANSLATION REQUIREMENTS AND REMOVING REQUIREMENTS FOR CLOSED CAPTIONING. BUT MEMBERS THIS BILL IS LONG OVERDUE FOR TOO LONG MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HAVE BEEN PRECLUDED FROM PARTICIPATING IN GOVERNMENT DUE TO REQUIREMENTS TO ATTEND IN PERSON. THERE ARE A MYRIAD OF REASONS WHY SOMEONE WOULD BE UNABLE TO ATTEND SAY A TUESDAY NIGHT SEVEN PM CITY COUNCIL MEETING AND SIT THERE FOR SEVERAL HOURS OR TO MAKE A PUBLIC COMMENT JUST SO THEIR VOICES HEARD. YOU KNOW THEY COULD BE WORKING THEY MIGHT HAVE CHILDREN TAKE CARE OF. ETCETERA THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO PARTICIPATE IN CITY COUNCIL OR COUNTY BOARD OF COUNTY BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS MEETING EITHER IN PERSON TELEPHONICALLY OR THROUGH THE INTERNET. THIS BILL IS ESPECIALLY TIMELY GIVEN THAT LOCAL AGENCIES HAVE ALREADY HAD TO IMPLEMENT WAYS FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO ENGAGE REMOTELY WE WANT TO SEE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES CONTINUE AFTER THE PANDEMIC. IN ORDER FOR US TO HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HEAR THE VOICES OF ALL OUR CONSTITUENTS SIR RESPECTFLLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB THREE THREE NINE AND WITH THAT I HAVE TWO SPEAKERS THAT SUPPORT TODAY.

NOT JUST THOSE FOR WHOM PARTICIPATION IF NEED BE. IN THE PAST IS THE THING THAT'S WHAT HE BECOME MORE VISIBLE TO THOSE WHO HAVE ALWAYS HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO IGNORE THEM. BECOME CLEAR THAT GOVERNMENT ALONE CANNOT SOLVE THE MOST PRESSING RACIAL SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE ISSUES OF OUR TIME. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEANINGFULLY EXPAND ACCESS TO THE PUBLIC MITIGATING SOME OF THE INVESTORS AND THE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION PROCESS THAT YOU SEE TODAY. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A MORE JUST AND EQUITABLE STATE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE ALL VOICES ARE HEARD IN DECISION MAKING ESPECIALLY ALREADY MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES. WORLD WORKING CLASS FOLKS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. SENIORS AND PEOPLE OF THE BILL LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH. WE ENVISION A CALIFORNIA WERE ALL PUBLIC MEETINGS INTERACT WITH REMOTE PARTICIPATION IN LANGUAGE SERVICES IMPORTANT MODERNIZATION TO CREATE A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY PUBLIC PROP BACK. OVER A HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS FROM ACROSS THE STATE FROM DIVERSE LOCATIONS IN THE DIVERSE CONSTITUENCIES. THE COURT DECISION A CALIFORNIA CITY HOW IT WOULD POSITIVELY IMPACT COMMUNITY TO HISTORICALLY BEEN MARGINALIZED THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION MAKING PROCESS. WORLD COMMUNITY PEOPLE CAN WORKING CAN'T TAKE TIME TO ATTEND PUBLIC MEETINGS IN PERSON. DISABILITY INTO YOUR RECORDS AND PEOPLE WHO SPEAK A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH OFTEN SERVICE YOU GET THE TABLE AND HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PUBLIC DECISIONS THAT AFFECT THEM.

SPECIAL SINCE THE SUPERVISORS MAY IN THE MIDDLE WORK DAY. TUESDAY ANY. CORPORATE COMMUNITY OF ABOUT THAT. READ THE TROUBLE IN OUR A HALF TO THE COUNTY MEETINGS THAT HELD RIVER. EITHER JUST AT THE EXAMPLE OF BROKEN. THAT TO PROTECT IN COVER. BUT THE- IN THE- CREDIT. IT IS EVEN MORE. FOR PEOPLE WHO RELY PUBLIC. HE'S COMMITTEE COMMUNITIES. WILL BE ABLE TO PROTECT. REMOTELY UNDER EIGHTY THREE. NINE THAT INCLUDES THE COMMITTEES PROPOSED AMENDMENT. THE COMMUNITIES A FAIR. LAVIGNE MADERA COUNTY AND COUNTLESS BARTLETT. EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THE SAME ACT TO PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. PARENTS WISHING TO PARTICIPATE IN SCHOOL BOARD MEETINGS REMOTELY SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO SO. COMMUNITY LEADERS WISHING TO PARTICIPATE IN COUNCIL THE GOVERNMENT PLANNING COMMISSION SIMPLY CICADELLIDAE COMMISSION FAMILY SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO SO. THE CANADIAN AMENDMENT CHALLENGE THE BASIC PRINCIPLE THAT GOVERNMENT MIGHT BE ACCEPTABLE TO ALL. THE ACT IF YOU'RE ELECTED OFFICIALS AS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT. WE ARE DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE COMMITTEES INSISTENCE ON AMENDMENTS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE PROPOSED EXTENSION OF PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. WE BELIEVE THAT EIGHTY THREE THIRTY NINE SHOULD BE BUILT UPON AND EXPANDED TO ENCOMPASS ALL GOVERNMENT MEETINGS IN CALIFORNIA AND WE- URGE THE COMMITTEE. TO CONTINUE TOWARDS THE STATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW BONNIE LEE. PLEASE GET AFTER- CHAIRMAN MA'AM. MY NAME IS BONNIE AND I AM A POOR TRUST WITH THE SAN CLARITA SCHOOL. I AM SPEAKING TO YOU TO TAKE ON MY OWN BEHALF I AM SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL TODAY AS A LOCAL ELECTED WHO HAS SEEN A DRASTIC INCREASE IN PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND ENGAGEMENT IN OUR MEETINGS TO RESUME. THIS BILL IS TIMELY AND VERY MUCH NEEDED TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY. AND ACCESSIBILITY TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. I'M AWARE THAT THE AUTHOR HAS TAKEN AMENDMENTS TO LIMIT THE APPLICATION OF THIS BILL TO CITY COUNCILS. AND BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ONLY BUT I'M HOPEFUL THAT THIS INITIATIVE CAN LATER EXPAND. TO INCLUDE MORE LOCAL AGENCIES SUCH A SCHOOL BOARD. AS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER I OFTEN WORK WITH PARENTS WHO ARE UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR MEETINGS BECAUSE THEY CANNOT TRAVEL OR FIND CHILD CARE OPTIONS FOR MEETINGS THAT MAY GO ON FOR SEVERAL HOURS. CONSTITUENTS NEED A WAY TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES AFTER ELECTIONS. BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE HAS TIME TO DRIVE TO SCHOOL BOARD MEETINGS OR CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS AND SIT THERE FOR FIVE HOURS. I LOCAL ELECTED SO THE ONLY WAY WE CAN HAVE A FUNCTIONING GOVERNMENT IS WHEN WE HAVE PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT AND THEN WHEN OUR COMMUNITIES ARE EDUCATED ON THE ISSUES. DURING THIS PANDEMIC WE'VE BEEN REQUIRED TO FIND ALTERNATIVE METHODS TO ENGAGE THE PUBLIC. WHICH HAS INCLUDED THE MEETINGS. PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC REGULAR IN PERSON BOARD MEETINGS WOULD ATTRACT MAYBE A DOZEN MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. DURING THE PANDEMIC THANKS TO LIVE STREAM AND RELATED PUBLIC ACCESS BE A WEAPON ARE IN TELEPHONE I'VE SEEN UP TO A TEN X. INCREASE IN PARTICIPATION BECAUSE WE ALLOW REMOTE PARTICIPATION OPTION THROUGH OPTIONS LIKE ZOOM WHICH HAS BEEN CRITICAL AND ENGAGING PARENTS WHILE DISCUSSING REMOTE EDUCATION. AND THE SAY FREE OPENING OF OUR SCHOOLS. DUE TO REMOTE PARTICIPATION WE NOW SEE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY TUNED INTO OUR LIVE STREAMS WITH ANOTHER EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO WATCH THE LIVE STREAM AFTER WE ARE. ADJOURNED I'VE ALSO HEARD FEEDBACK ABOUT HOW THE PUBLIC HAS SEEN A LOT OF DOORS OPEN FOR THEM TO ENGAGE CIVICALLY. AND MAKE THEIR VOICES HEARD SUCH AS I REALLY HOPE YOU CONTINUE OFFERING VIRTUAL PARTICIPATION IN BOARD MEETINGS BECAUSE I CAN'T ATTEND IN PERSON. AND BEING ABLE TO ATTEND MEETINGS VIRTUALLY HAS HELPED ME BE BETTER INFORMED ABOUT THE GOINGS ON IN THE DISTRICT. I KNOW A LOT OF LOCAL AGENCIES ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST OF IMPLEMENTATION. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE'VE ALREADY FOUND WAYS TO IMPLEMENT TECHNOLOGY AND THE INCREASED AVENUES OF PARTICIPATION ARE WELL WORTH IT. SAMPLE IT'S FREE TO LIVE STREAMING MEETING FROM YOUR PHONE TO YOU TOO. SO THERE ARE WAYS TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF SUBSTANTIATED WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY. AND MONEY SHOULD NOT BE AN ISSUE WHEN IT COMES TO INVOLVING THE PUBLIC. HAS ELECTED OFFICIALS WE SHOULD ALWAYS BE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO INCREASE OUR OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT WITH MEMBERS OF THE pGREAT STEP IN THAT DIRECTION. ONE GOOD THING THAT HAS COME FROM THE PANDEMIC IS THE INCREASING PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND THE AUTHORS MISSION OF INCREASING PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THANK YOU.

I EVEN THINK BACK TO HOW MANY POSITIONS OF MINE ENGAGE IN THEIR FIRST CITY COUNCIL BEING OR SCHOOL BOARD MEETING BECAUSE THEY'RE ABLE TO DO SO NOW WITHOUT THE ANT BE INTIMIDATING ATMOSPHERE HAVING TO GO TO CITY HALL OR GO TO A CERTAIN PLACE AND TESTIFIED- IT MEANS A LOT I THINK AND WILL HOPEFULLY REAL RESHAPE OUR GOVERNMENT IF WE HEAR MORE VOICES. AND I'M VERY MUCH COMMITTED TO CONTINUED WHAT THIS WORK AND MAKING SURE WE HAVE MORE TRANSPARENCY WE HAVE MORTGAGE AT ALL LEVEL I SEE A LOT OF THE SENTIMENT OF MANY OF OUR SPEAKERS THAT I WISH YES IT WAS UNIFORM ACROSS ALL.

HELLO THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE AND I'M SUPPORTING THE BILL WITH AMENDMENTS TODAY AND I.

WE ALSO BOTH SEE THE BENEFITS OF REMOTE REMOTE ACCESS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT MEETINGS FOR PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE SCOPE. COST AND IMPLEMENTATION CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY OUR FELLOW LAWMAKERS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. I DO REMAIN WORRIED ABOUT SOME OF THE BILL'S NEW REQUIREMENTS I DO NOT QUESTION THAT THEY HAVE BEEN CRAFTED WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS. TO INCREASE ACCESS FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCEEDINGS OF THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND WHO FACE BARRIERS TO ACTIVE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. BUT I HOPE YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK ON POSSIBLE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AS YOU MOVE FORWARD. I HOPE YOU'LL ALWAYS I HOPE YOU WILL FIND WAYS TO CLOSE AVENUES FOR BAD ACTORS TO STYMIE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE LOCAL MEETINGS OR FINAL LEGAL LOOPHOLES TO NULLIFY GOVERNMENT. DECISIONS I AGREEING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT ADVOCATES APPLYING THESE NEW RULES TO OUR LOCAL AGENCIES WHILE EXEMPTING STATE AGENCIES AND THE LEGISLATURE. IS ONE MORE REASON FOR PEOPLE TO FEEL CYNICAL ABOUT WHAT WE DO HERE IN SACRAMENTO. IF THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT FOR DEMOCRACY. AND WE FEEL IT IS ATTAINABLE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HOW DO WE EXEMPT OURSELVES. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO ADDRESS THE REMAINING CONCERNS WITH THEIR ABILITY TO COMPLY WITH THE BILL. BOTH FINANCIALLY AND LIKE JUST LIKE JUST TO CLICK. AND TO BE HELD HARMLESS FOR NONCOMPLIANCE IF THEY MAKE GOOD FAITH EFFORTS TO COMPLY.

I'LL BEGIN WITH A AB TEN TWENTY NINE THAT'S- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLINS BILL ON PRESERVATION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WERE ALL AWARE OF THE MASSIVE SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE STATE. ON THE LESSER KNOWN CONTRIBUTORS TO THE ISSUE IS THE EXPIRATION OF SO CALLED AFFORDABILITY COVENANTS. WHEN CALIFORNIA HAD REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS THAT RECEIVE FUNDING FROM THE AGENCY WERE REQUIRED TO RECORD COVENANTS ON THE PROPERTY THAT WOULD GUARANTEE THAT THOSE UNITS WOULD REMAIN AFFORDABLE. AT BELOW MARKET RATES FOR THIRTY AND IN SOME INSTANCES FIFTY YEARS. AS TIME PASSES MANY OF THOSE COVENANTS REACH THERE ARE TIME LIMITS AND EXPIRE. AS THOSE TIME LIMITS EXPIRE THE UNIT MAY THEM BE LEASED AT MARKET RATE. AS EACH UNIT RESETS TO MARKET RATE THAT'S ONE LESS AFFORDABLE UNIT THAT IS AVAILABLE TO A LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. AB TEN TWENTY NINE SIMPLY ASK THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. TO ADD PRESERVATION OF AFFORDABLE UNITS TO THEIR LIST OF PRIORITIES FOR ALLOCATION OF FUNDING. IT'S MUCH EASIER TO SAVE UNIT FROM CONVERTING TO MARKET RATE THAN TO BUILD A BRAND NEW UNIT THIS IS A SIMPLE YET IMPORTANT STEP TO MAINTAIN CALIFORNIA'S. SCARCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK. WE HAVE NO OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. ON THE PHONE TODAY ARE SHERMAN'S OFFICE TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF FOSTER CITY AND BARBARA GROSS STUDY RETIRED RESIDENT OF FOSTER'S LANDING WHICH IS EIGHT RENTAL HOUSING DEVELOPMENT WHICH SEVENTY FOUR UNITS.

AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS FOSTER LANDING MYSELF IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES. AND IT INCLUDED SEVENTY FOUR BELOW MARKET RATE RENTAL UNITS. THE PMR RESTRICTIONS WERE SET TO EXPIRE IN PHASES STARTING WITH FIFTY UNITS EXPIRING AT THE END OF LAST YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY. AND THE FINAL STATE EXPIRING BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. MORE THAN FIFTY UNITS THAT WERE SET TO EXPIRE LAST YEAR THE CITY AND THE PROPERTY OWNER AGREED TO EXTEND THE AFFORDABLE RENTS TO THE FAKE ONE TENANT UNTIL DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF THAT YEAR. THE CITY ALLOCATED FUNDS TO PAY ITS SHARE OF THIS PROGRAM. HOWEVER AT THE END OF THIS YEAR THE RESIDENTS IN THE BMR UNITS THAT POSSIBLY ENDING WILL SEE THEIR MONTHLY RENT INCREASE FROM FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO APPROXIMATELY. THIRTY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS. BOB CITY HAS TAKEN SEVERAL STEPS TO ASSIST THE TENANTS OF POSSIBLY ENDING. AND ALL RESIDENTS IN OUR CITY WHO LIVE IN OR ARE LOOKING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AREA ALL HAVE EXTREMELY LOW TURNOVER AND HAVE VERY LONG WAITING LIST SOME UP TO THREE YEARS. AB TEN TWENTY NINE WOULD BETTER POSITION FOSTER CITY TO COMPETE FOR FUND THROUGH THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM. IN AN EFFORT TO SECURE A LONG TERM FUNDING SOURCE FOR FOSTER COMMUNITY. FOSTER LANDING IS NOT A FOR FOSTER CITY IS NOT ALONE IN GRAPPLING WITH THE POTENTIAL LOSS OF EXISTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS.

JUST TO AVOID A PENALTY OF HAVING TO REVISE THE ELEMENT IN FOUR YEARS. IN SOME JURISDICTIONS THE ADOPTED ELEMENT WAS NOT REVISED TO CORRECT THE LEGAL DEFICIENCIES FOR MORE THAN TWELVE MONTHS AFTER THE DEADLINE AND IN SOME CASES NOT FOR YEARS. FOR INSTANCE ONE CITY ADOPTED A DRAFT ELEMENT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT HAD FOUND DID NOT MEET STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS. THE CITY TOOK NO FURTHER ACTION TO REMEDY THE LEGAL DEFICIENCIES UNTIL TWENTY NINETEEN FIVE YEARS AFTER THE CITY WAS ORIGINALLY SUPPOSED TO ADOPT ITS ELEMENT. AB THIRTEEN NINETY EIGHT ADDRESSES THESE PROBLEMS BY CLARIFYING THE LAW TO REQUIRE ADOPTION OF AN H. C. D. APPROVED HOUSING ELEMENT BY THE STATUTORY DEADLINE.

MOST OF US ARE ALL OF US HAVE HOMES AND IF WE NEED TO USE THE RESTROOM AT HOME WE CAN DO THAT AS WELL. BUT FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHICH ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. THEY DON'T HAVE THAT OPTION. DURING THIS PANDEMIC WE KNOW THAT NOT ONLY ARE FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS ARE RETAIL AND OUR PUBLIC BATHROOMS HAVE BEEN CLOSED SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS SIMPLY THEY DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO USE THE RESTROOM OR TO WASH THEIR HANDS. AS A COUNTRY AND AS A NATION AND AS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS IS A BASIC BASIC. RIGHT THAT WE SHOULD HAVE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOUSING OR TALKING ABOUT BROADBAND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EDUCATION IN SOMETHING AS BASIC AND SANITARY AS BEING ABLE TO USE A PUBLIC RESTROOM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN OUR LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES IS ELUSIVE. NOW IS WERE RE OPENING WE ALSO KNOW THIS JUST DOES NOT PERTAIN TO HOMELESSNESS BUT IT ALSO PERTAINS TO OUR YOUNG ATHLETES WHO ARE NOW ON BALLER A BALL PARKS AND TO SENIORS AND OTHERS WHO SIMPLY WANT TO GO OUTDOORS. AND USE THE BATHROOM. MANY LOCAL MUNCIPALITIES HAVE NOT ONLY LOCKED THEIR BATHROOMS DURING THE PANDEMIC BUT EVEN BEFORE THAT. BECAUSE SOMETIMES THERE ARE THINGS THAT OCCUR IN BATHROOMS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED WHETHER IT'S CLEANLINESS WHETHER THERE'S ISSUES OF SAFETY BUT TO LOCK BATHROOMS UP FOR CITIZENS AND FOR OUR PUBLIC IS SIMPLY SOMETHING THAT IS OCCURRING MORE OFTEN AND THIS BILL SIMPLY SAYS LET'S TAKE AN INVENTORY. LET'S FIND OUT WHAT IS OPEN AND THAT'S WHAT IT DOES AT THE LEAST IT COULD AND SHOULD DO MUCH MORE BUT THIS IS JUST ABOUT TAKING AN INVENTORY OF PUBLIC RESTROOMS IN OUR LOCAL CITIES.

AB SEVENTY SEVEN WOULD ALLOW LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO RECEIVE ARENA CREDIT FOR CONVERTING MARKET RATE UNITS TO DEED RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE UNITS. THIS WILL INCENTIVIZE THE LONG TERM PRESERVATION OF LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSING. CARRYING CONVERTING EXISTING UNITS IS AN IMPORTANT COMPLEMENT TO ANY PRODUCTION STRATEGY AND OFFERS A CHEAPER FASTER AND MORE EFFICIENT WAY TO INCREASE MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING YOU COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL SUPPORTED BY A BROAD COALITION THAT INCLUDES THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM IN THE SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY ARE SCOTT CARPER FROM THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY HOUSING AGENCY AND MICHAEL LANE FROM SPARK THANK YOU AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE HAVE- MISTER LANE ON THE LINE FOR MR CARPER PLEASE. FINDER OPEN. MANAGE YOUR NUMBERS MICHAEL IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA PLANNING URBAN RESEARCH ASSOCIATION A PUBLIC POLICY THINK TANK KNOWN AS BURKE IT IS TOO EXPENSIVE TO BUILD HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA A SINGLE UNIT A RENTAL HOUSE IN OUR COASTAL AREAS CAN COST EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE. WE DESPERATELY NEED INNOVATION AND NEW APPROACHES. WE MUST INCENTIVIZE BUILDING TYPES CONSTRUCTION METHODS AND FINANCING MODELS THEY CAN REDUCE THE COST TO PROVIDE GREATER AFFORDABILITY. WITH NO ARE RELATIVELY SHOULD SHALLOW PUBLIC SBSIDIES. VERY OFTEN ACQUISITION REHABILITATION OF EXISTING BUILDINGS CAN COST LESS THAN HALF OF NEW CONSTRUCTION. THE RENT AND THEN WE CAPS AND THE PROPERTY MANAGER OVER TIME TO CREATE GREATER AFFORDABILITY.

CONTOURING AB SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN BEFORE YOU TODAY. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND ENGAGEMENT ON THIS ISSUE. AT A TIME WHEN CALIFORNIANS IT CONTINUED FINANCIAL HARDSHIP. RELATED TO THE ONGOING COATED NINETEEN PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. UNSUSTAINABLE HOUSING COSTS AND THE PERSISTENT THREAT OF DISPLACEMENT WE NEED INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO DRIVE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY FOR ALL. COUNTY HA WAS FORMS TO SQUARELY ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S GROWING AFFORDABILITY AND THAT MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING CRISIS. WE UTILIZE REVENUES GENERATED FROM THE SALE OF COUNTY AJ ISSUE GOVERNMENTAL REVENUE BONDS TO FULLY FINANCE THE ACQUISITION AND CONVERSION OF EXISTING MARKET RATE APARTMENT COMMUNITIES TO RENT RESTRICTED HOUSEHOLDS. BURNING BELOW 120% AREA MEDIAN INCOME. THIS EQUATES TO HOUSING FOR ESSENTIAL WORKERS LIKE NURSES TEACHERS FIRST RESPONDERS LIBRARIANS AND SOCIAL WORKERS EACH OF WHOM EARN TOO MUCH TO QUALIFY FOR TRADITIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAMS YET INCREASINGLY NOT ENOUGH TO LIVE WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE.THROUGH THAT PROCESS WE BECAME AWARE THAT TODAY THERE WAS NO MESSAGE FOR CITIES TO CLAIM CREDIT FOR THESE TYPE OF CONVERSION. BUT EIGHTY SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN WOULD PROVIDE CITIES WITH A MODEST PATHWAY TO RECEIVING CREDIT IN THEIR ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORTS FOR THE CONVERSION OF MARKET RATE UNITS. TO DEED RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE UNITS. BUT INCENTIVIZING THE LONG TERM PRESERVATION OF LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSING WHILE GUARANTEEING LONG TERM AFFORDABILITY AND RENTER PROTECTION.

I AM PLEASED TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY MOTIONS DO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. HUSS YOU DETECTED MINUTES CLASS RELICS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL AGUIAR-CURRY HI AGUIAR-CURRY HAI LACKEY. HELLO FOR HARDWARE HI BOERNER HORVATH I RONALD RONALD I WAS REDUCED FROM HIS ASIDE ROBERT RIVAS ROBERT RIVAS I WILL TELL. I WILL TELL HI YOU HAVE. SIX ZERO SIX ZERO. ALL RIGHT ONE MOMENT HERE NEXT BILL THAT WOULD BE ITEM FOR. AB NINE EIGHTY NINE PROCEEDS WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH AROUND HERE- PLEASED TO PRESENT THIS BILL AS WELL WHICH WOULD CREATE A SPECIALIZED APPEAL PANEL TO ADDRESS SITUATIONS WHERE LOCAL OFFICIALS SEEK TO PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN VIOLATION OF STATE LAW. THE LEGISLATION IS A MODEST EFFORT TO STRENGTHEN THE PURPOSE AND INTENT OF THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. AUSTIN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO THIS ACT AIMS TO PREVENT EFFORTS TO BLOCK THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT OTHERWISE COMPLIES WITH THE APPLICABLE GENERAL PLAN AND ZONING AND SUBDIVISION STANDARDS. UNFORTUNATELY DESPITE CALIFORNIA WELL DOCUMENTED AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS. SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE DEFIED THE ACT AND TONIGHT AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS EVEN WHEN THEY ARE FULLY COMPLIANT WITH ALL LOCAL ZONING AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THESE OFFICIALS UNDERSTAND THAT IN MOST CASES AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROPONENTS WILL HAVE NO PRACTICAL MEANS TO CHALLENGE THE UNLAWFUL DENIAL. AS THE CURRENT REMEDY LITIGATION IN SUPERIOR COURT. IS ALMOST ALWAYS PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE TIME CONSUMING AND OTHERWISE IMPRACTICAL. AB NINE EIGHT NINE WOULD ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BY CREATING AN ALTERNATE REVIEW PANEL WITH SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE. MODELED AFTER AN APPROACH THAT HAS SUCCESSFULLY BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN OTHER STATES. THE REVIEW PANEL WHEN IT COULD REPRESENTATIVES FROM BOTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IMPORTANTLY THE JURISDICTION OF THE REVIEW PANEL WOULD BE VERY NARROW AND LIMITED TO ONLY ONE ISSUE. WHETHER THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT VIOLATED THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT BY DISAPPROVING A PROJECT WITHOUT MAKING THE APPROPRIATE FINDINGS AS REQUIRED BY LAW. THE PANEL WITH US WE WERE ABLE TO RESOLVE THIS DISPUTE. ANYMORE EXPEDITED IT LESS EXPENSIVE LESS CONFRONTATIONAL AND MORE CONSISTENT MANNER. TO BE CLEAR AB NINE EIGHT NINE SIMPLY PROVIDES A NEW PROCEDURAL REMEDY TO RESOLVE DISPUTES IT DOES NOT HAPPEN DON'T CHANGE ANY LOCAL ZONING OR LAND USE POLICIES OR OTHERWISE CHANGE SOMETHING OF STATE LAW AROUND HOUSING. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THE FALL STATE LAW ON GOOD FAITH ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO HAVE ANY INTERACTION WITH THIS REVIEW PANEL. THIS LESS ADVERSARIAL AND MORE COST EFFECTIVE APPROACH IS SUPPORTED BY A BROAD COALITION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING GROUPS HOUSING ADVOCATES AND LOCAL OFFICIALS. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY ARE TWENTY BELIEVE FROM THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION AND MARK STIVERS FROM THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP THANK YOU RECOVERY RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I BELIEVE REMARKS MARK STIVERS HERE IN THE GALLERY WOULD YOU LIKE TO SPEAK FIRST. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS- MARC DIVERS OF THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP. THE PARTNERSHIP PROVIDES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO MOST OF THE NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS IN THE STATE. OUR PARTNERS ARE WELL AWARE THAT A GOOD NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES ARE NOT ARE UNWELCOMING OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE HEAR OFTEN FROM OUR DEVELOPERS THEY THEY WILL NOT TAKE THE FINANCIAL RISK TO BUY A PROPERTY IF THEY DON'T THINK THEY CAN GET THROUGH THE LOCAL ENTITLEMENT PROCESS. WELL THE EXISTING HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT IN THEORY PROTECTS DEVELOPERS FROM ARBITRATE DENIALS OR UNREASONABLE CONDITIONS. TO MAKE THE DEVELOPMENT OF FEASIBLE IS A RELATIVELY EMPTY PROTECTION. VERY FEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS WILL SPEND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN LEGAL FEES INTEREST AND ADDITIONAL CARRYING COSTS. AT LEAST TWO YEARS OF THEIR TIME TO GO THROUGH THE COURTS. THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS BODY CONCEPT HAS BEEN TRIED AND FOUND SUCCESSFUL IN MASSACHUSETTS WHERE IT'S BEEN IN PLACE SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE. AND ALSO RHODE ISLAND ILLINOIS AND OREGON. RT HEALTH AB NINE NINE WILL SIT. CHANGE THE RISK PROFILE GIVING THEM GREATER CERTAINTY AND CONFIDENCE TO BRING AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROPOSALS FORWARD AND MORE IMPORTANTLY GET THEM BUILT. AB NINETY NINE IS ABOUT EFFICIENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY WE STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR STIVERS- NOW WITH TWENTY BROUGH IT MOVIES ON THE PHONE I BELIEVE OPERATOR. YES THANK YOU CHAIR NUMBERS. TWENTY TO CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION I'LL BE BRIEF STINT A LOT OF. GOOD POINTS ALREADY MADE- BUT ABOUT THE BILL. AS PREVIOUSLY STATED AB NINE EIGHT NINE DOES NOT TAKE. AWAY LOCAL CONTROL BUT THE BILL SIMPLY ALLOWS ME TO CREATE A STATE APPEALS. PANEL TO REVIEW IN PROJECT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT ISSUE THE REJECTION WAS DONE ACCORDING TO CURRENT STATE LAW. WHILE THE HOUSE IN CALGARY ACTIVE STRONG LAW GOVERNMENT WILL PLAN USED TO DESIGN A POOR BUT HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS. MOST DEVELOPERS ARE HAVING TO GO TO COURT- DUE TO THE TIME AND MONEY SOCIAL OCCASION AS PRETTY. AS WELL. AGAIN THIS BILL IS A PERSONABLE- IMPORTANT TOOL TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH CURRENT STATE HELPING WALLS- IN THE BOOKS TODAY- AND FOR THOSE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR. YOUR AYE BUT WHEN THE TIME COMES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SABRINA WE NOW ARE LOOKING FOR OTHER WITNESSES. IN SUPPORT OPERATOR. THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT EIGHT IT NOW EIGHT.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PROVIDING OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL- AGAIN WE CALIFORNIA CITIES MUST OPPOSE EIGHTY NINE EIGHTY NINE WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR CONSIDERING THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE IN THE ANALYSIS I HAVEN'T HEARD YET WHETHER THE THERE'S GONNA TAKE THOSE MOMENTS BUT THOSE MOMENTS CERTAINLY- IMPROVE THE BILL AND DO ADDRESS SOME OF OUR CONCERNS HOWEVER A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE REMAINS- WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IT'S A APPROPRIATE TO ALLOW A BODY THAT'S MADE UP OF GOVERNOR POINT SHE'S TO SECOND GUESS A LAWFUL HOUSING PROJECT DENIAL AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. WE BELIEVE THAT THAT DETERMINATION IS BEST LEFT TO THE COURTS ONE OF THE PRIMARY FUNCTIONS OF OUR JUDICIARY ATTENTION WE ARBITER OF THOSE CASES AND WE FEEL STRONGLY THAT NEEDS TO REMAIN THERE I'M THE ANALYSIS TO REALLY- APPROPRIATELY AND ACCURATELY OUTLINED SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN RECENT YEARS TO THE OTHER ACCOUNTABILITY ACT AND ALSO THE CREATION OF HDDS HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY YET FROM THESE CHANGES ARE SIGNIFICANT AND- I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT OUR CITIES ARE ARE NOT YOU KNOW- ARBITRARILY OR INTENTIONALLY. IDENTIFIED HOW WE CAN ABILITY ACT IF THEY DO SO THEY WILL FACE A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR PER UNITS FINANCED FOR NOT FOLLOWING THAT ACT- SO AGAIN I THINK I THINK THAT OUR CITIES ARE CERTAINLY- NOT GONNA GET A VIOLATE THAT LAW IN A LOT OF WAYS I'M AB NINETY NINE ISN'T NECESSARY- WE BELIEVE IT'LL LEAD TO ADDITIONAL DELAYS AND UNCERTAINTY- SOME TO GET THERE THIS APPEALS BODY IF THEY DO NOT RULE IN FAVOR OF THE CITY I'M SURE THAT OUR CITIES WILL WILL CHALLENGE THAT IN COURT AS WELL SO- ULTIMATELY WILL END UP IN THE SAME PLACE- YOU KNOW WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S DESIRE TO STREAMLINE HOUSING TO MAKE IT QUICKER FASTER CHEAPER BETTER. THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE CALIFORNIA CITY STRONGLY SUPPORTS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT ACCOUNTABILITY WILL NEVER DEFEND ANYWHERE CITIES THAT VIOLATE THE LAW WILL COOLEY- BUT UNFORTUNATELY EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE IS NOT THE ANSWER AND WE HAVE TO OPPOSE THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DO YOU HAVE ANY. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. THANK YOU HAVE TO I THINK YOU THREE NINE THREE CALL. THANK YOU. I MEAN BROKEN KOHLI'S FOR SO FRANCISCO NEIGHBORHOOD. SPEAKING- ON MY OWN BEHALF. AN OFFICER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU RYAN FIVE SIX FIVE PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON CHRISTOPHER LEE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES ALSO TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA IN THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER WINDING QUEUE THANK YOU VERY MUCH OPERATOR DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER BOERNER HORVATH- THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I COME FROM ONE OF THE CITIES WHERE I'M NOT SURE I AGREE WITH YOUR YOUR WITNESS THAT- DEVELOPERS DON'T HAVE MONEY SO IF THEY LIKE THIS WAS A LOT- BUT IS NOT FOR VIOLATING THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT- BUT I DO BELIEVE THERE'S A VALUE. IN CREATING ANYTHING THAT ENCOURAGES MEDIATION AND KEEP CITIES OUT OF COURT I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ALL KNOWS. MY CITY HAS SPENT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TRYING TO GET IT RIGHT- AND SO I THINK THERE'S A VALUE IN CREATING THIS BODY I'M VERY HAPPY WITH THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. OF TWO LOCAL GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES- ON THIS APPEALS FOR BUT I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS SO FIRST OF ALL DO WE KNOW HOW MANY CITIES HAVE BEEN ACCUSED AND- TAKEN TO COURT FOR VIOLATING HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. LAST YEAR TOO YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT NUMBER I THINK WHAT WHAT THIS BILL IS GETTING OUT IS NINE THOSE INSTANCES WHERE EACH CD GETS INVOLVED BUT THOSE INSTANCES WHERE CITIES GET INVOLVED IN WHAT WE'VE HEARD IS OUR WITNESS TESTIFIED FROM THE INDUSTRY IS THAT THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF PEOPLE. DON'T WANT TO LITIGATE BECAUSEIT'S GOING TO TAKE TWO OR THREE YEARS OR PICKING A JUDGE OUT OF THE HOT SUPERIOR COURT WHO MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT SAYS IT'S GOING TO BE VERY EXPENSIVE. YOU'RE LIKELY TO GET INTO KALYTERA COLLATERAL ISSUES OF THE SCOPE OF DISCOVERY AND SO IT'S ACTUALLY JUST DISCOURAGING PEOPLE FROM FROM DEVELOPING IN THE FIRST PLACE SO WE FEEL LIKE THERE'S A STRONG RATIONALE FOR THE BILL BASED ON WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM PEOPLE ON THE GROUND. OKAY AND- ONE OF THE THINGS AND I AND I THINK WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS. BUT THE FACT THAT ONLY THE DEVELOPER CAN APPEAL THE DECISION. MAKES THIS. GIVES THE APPEARANCE THE DEVELOPER HAS THE POWER. AND I DON'T THINK- A CITY WOULD SAY AREN'T OUR DECISION WAS WRONG BUT IF THEY GET A THREAT OF LITIGATION THIS MIGHT BE A GREAT WAY TO MEDIATE SO I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU TO LOOK AT THAT EXPLORE PERHAPS. AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD- COULD THERE BE SOMETHING WHERE IT'S FAIR AND I'M MORE FOCUSED ON MEDIATION BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE REAL VALUE IN THIS BILL. COMES FROM- AND- COULD YOU WALK US THROUGH BECAUSE I THINK. I DON'T NECESSARILY UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY. HOW DOES THIS APPEALS BOARD WORK. RELATED TO THE CITY'S OWN DECISION MAKING PROCESS. THE COASTAL COMMISSION BECAUSE MOST OF THEM A LARGE PART OF MY DISTRICT HAS THE COASTAL COMMISSION. AND THEN HOW DOES IT WORK IN CIVIL COURTS IF YOU CAN LOOK AT THAT INTERSECTION. AND KIND OF WALK US THROUGH IT AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. FOR SOME FOLKS IN THE OPPOSITION AS WELL HERE YEAH ABSOLUTELY AND I AND I WILL SAY. I SHOULD SAY THIS FIRST OFF JUST TO WE WILL ACTUALLY BE ACCEPTING COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND I THINK THEY'RE VERY HELPFUL I WANT TO THANK. THE CHAIR AND HER STAFF FOR THOSE AMENDMENTS AND- AS I READ IT IT ADDRESSES- ALL OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE LEAGUE EXCEPT FOR ONE- WHERE I THINK WE HAVE A RESPECTFUL DISAGREEMENT. V. THE WAY THAT THIS WOULD WORK- SORT OF IN IN THEORY IS- ADD A DEVELOPER WOULD COME FORWARD SUBMIT. A PROPOSAL TO BUILD SOME AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT WOULD BE FULLY COMPLIANT WITH THE ZONING. THAT WAS DECIDED BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT THEY SAID THIS IS THIS IS MERRY IN THE CITY WHERE YOU CAN BUILD THIS TYPE OF HOUSING. YOU KNOW THERE'S AN ARBITRARY AND UNLAWFUL DENIAL THE CITY DOESN'T MAKE THE REQUIRED FINDINGS AS AS REQUIRED UNDER THE HOUSING COMPANY ACT. THE DEVELOPER COULD THEN DECIDE THAT THEY WANTED TO APPEAL THAT DECISION TO THIS SPECIALIZED REVIEW BOARD. THEY WOULD HAVE THE BURDEN BY A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE TO DEMONSTRATE. ON THAT VERY VERY NARROW ISSUE THIS THIS IS NOT MEANT TO GET INTO A LOT OF DIFFERENT KINDS ISSUES IN A VERY NARROW ISSUE. WITH PEOPLE WITH SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE THE CITY DID NOT MAKE THE REQUIRED FINDINGS. IF THEY COULD DEMONSTRATE THAT. THE CITY WOULD THEN HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REBUT THAT TO SHOW WHY DID THAT THEY DID IN FACT HAVE. THE APPROPRIATE FINDINGS TO MAKE THAT DECISION TO DENY IT- AND THEN IT WOULD BE UP TO THIS- THIS PANEL TO MAKE A DETERMINATION. WHAT WE FOUND FROM FROM- FROM MASSACHUSETTS AND OTHER STATES IS THAT THE DECISIONS TEND TO BE NEXT IT IS NOT MEANT TO BE A- A BODY THAT COMES DOWN ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE REPRESENTATIVES BOTH FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT FROM JURISDICTIONS LARGER JURISDICTIONS SMALLER JURISDICTIONS. AND FROM FOLKS WITH SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE. I DELETE TO YOUR POINT- THE PARTIES WOULD ACTUALLY SETTLE BEFORE THAT HAPPENED- AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ATTRACTED TO ME ABOUT THIS BILL IS. I THINK IT WAS AND I DON'T KNOW MAYBE MISS REMEMBER EXACTLY WHAT I THINK WAS 71% OF THE APPEALS ACTUALLY SETTLED BEFORE THEY WERE HURT- SO THIS ACTUALLY INDUCED TO THE PARTIES TO COME TO SOME AGREEMENT. TO NEGOTIATE A COMPROMISE AVOIDING THE EXPENSE AND DELAY. AND CONTROVERSY OF LITIGATION. IF YOU DID HAVE A DECISION FROM AN APPEAL PANEL THAT EITHER PARTY DON'T LIKE. EITHER PARTY COULD THEN. APPEAL THAT DECISION TO- TO IT TOO TO THE SUPERIOR COURT SO IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY ANYBODY'S OPPORTUNITY TO AT THE END OF THE DAY. SEEK A JUDICIAL DETERMINATION IN COURT BUT WHAT IT WHAT WE HOPE IT WILL DO. IS PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO NEGOTIATE COMPROMISE AND GET THINGS DONE ON THE FRONT DESK. AND THAT ABILITY TO COMPROMISE ONE OF THE REASONS I LIKE TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS BECAUSE I THINK. YOU'RE ON TO SOMETHING HERE- BUT I YOU KNOW I THINK THAT ABILITY TO COMPROMISE AND MEDIATE IS WHERE THE REAL POWER IN THIS BILL IS- DO YOU KNOW HOW IT WORKS. WITH THE IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS WITH THE COASTAL COMMISSION. USUALLY ANY LAND USE DECISION WE MAKE IN THE COASTAL ZONE- CAN BE APPEALED ON ITS FACE TO. THE COASTAL COMMISSION SO WHERE WOULD. THIS FIT IN TO THAT. PROCESS YOU KNOW THAT'S IT'S AN ACTUAL QUESTION I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE I'M HAPPY TO GET THAT ANSWER FOR YOU AND I YOU KNOW VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFUL FEEDBACK YOU'VE GIVEN HONEST ON HAPPY TO CAN. TO CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT I WILL HAVE TO GET BACK ON THE COASTAL COMMISSION. AND I APPRECIATE YOU ALSO. AS HAVING THIS DIALOGUE AND YOU KNOW I KNOW YOU'RE CONTINUING TO WORK ON IT. AND WITH THAT I'LL GIVE A COURTESY I TODAY AND HOPE TO SEE. THE CONTINUED. IMPROVEMENT IN THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK VERY MUCH OF THEIR IN OTHER. OF THE COMMITTEE- TO RE HAVING MOTION WE NEED A MOTION PLANES WILL GO. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS OKAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROBERT RIVAS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK HERE WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU- THANK YOU WAS WORKING WITH MY COMMITTEE ON THE AMENDMENTS ON THIS BILL THE BILL CREATES AN EXPEDIA A PROCESS TO RESOLVE VIOLATIONS OF HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS THAT MAY LACK THE RESOURCES TO PURSUE REMEDIES IN COURT. I APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE TO ENSURE THAT ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY COMMITTEE COMPLY WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT. THIS WILL HELP INSURE THAT ALL PARTIES INVOLVED IN HEARINGS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ARE AFFORDED STANDARD LEVELS OF DUE PROCESS. THAT APPLY TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS ULTIMATELY THIS WILL STRENGTHEN THE COMMITTEE ENSURE THAT ITS ACTIONS ARE TRANSPARENT AND ACCOUNTABLE I AM PLEASED TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY.

TO ATTRACT NEW RESIDENTS CITIES MUST PROVIDE NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS AS THE CASE STUDY FOR THE LOS ANGELES SMALLER OR NICHE SHOWS SMALL HOME NOT DEVELOPMENTS ARE FEE SIMPLE UNITS THAT INCREASE HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES WHILE WORKING WITH EXISTING LAND USE DESIGNATIONS. ALTHOUGH THESE DEVELOPMENTS DO NOT INCREASE IS OWNING DENSITY pUTILIZED LOTS OF THIS INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF UNITS MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. WE NEED ALL THE TOOLS IN OUR TOOLBOX IN ORDER TO ADDRESS OUR HOUSING CRISIS. AB ZERO THREE IS A VERY SMALL SHIFT IT WAYS THE MINIMUM LOT SIZES AS LONG AS YOU BOTH THE DENSITY. TO DO FEES SIMPLE ZERO LOT LINE HOMES IS THE PRECONDITION FOR TINY HOMES. IT'S THE PRECONDITION FOR ROW HOMES AND WHAT YOU DON'T WAIVE PARKING MINIMUMS BUT WE SAY. A CITY CANNOT REQUIRE AN H. AWAY AND IT CANNOT REQUIRE HOMES FOR CARS SO IT DOES DO SOME THINGS THAT MAKE IT FEASIBLE. AND REALLY COULD SET THAT MISSING MIDDLE HOUSING THAT WE NEED IN CALIFORNIA TO REALLY HELP PEOPLE BE ABLE TO BUY AND BUILD EQUITY. IN THE HOUSING MARKET WELL I'D LIKE TO NOTE THAT WE HAVE TAKEN AMENDMENTS IN HOUSING.

MEMBERS ONE IN EIGHT CALIFORNIA HOME STILL DO NOT HAVE INTERNET ACCESS IN IN SMALL TOWNS RURAL AREAS THAT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR FACE EVEN HIGHER NUMBERS OF STUDENTS AND FAMILIES WHO REMAIN DISCONNECTED UNDER THE CURRENT STANDARDS AND THE SEC IS CONSIDERING ACTION TO SIGNIFICANTLY RAISE THOSE STANDARDS AS WE SPEAK. RECENT EVENTS HAVE MADE GLARINGLY CLEAR HOW CRITICAL CONNECTIVITY IN THAT IS IN TIMES OF EMERGENCIES. INCLUDING THE MASSIVE TRANSITION OF STUDENTS LEARNING FROM HOME. ACCESS BY SMALL BUSINESSES TO THE DIGITAL ECONOMY TELEHEALTH WIND HEALTHAXIS IS CONSTRAINED. STATING FOR WILDFIRES THAT IS WHY I'M PARTNERING WITH SENATOR GONZALEZ AND TWO DOZEN OF OUR COLLEAGUES. OVER THE PAST MONTHS WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER ON A LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE THAT WILL MODERNIZE STANDARDS AND UPDATE THEM AS THE FCC STANDARDS EVOLVED TO ADOPT NEW SPEEDS AND TECHNOLOGY. OUR BILLS WILL PROVIDE ELIGIBILITY FOR CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUNDING AT TWENTY FIVE DOWNLOAD THREE UPLOAD WITH A BILL THAT AT TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE. AB FOURTEEN PRIORITIZES THE DEPLOYMENT OF BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE. UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED RURAL AND URBAN AREAS WHILE OPENING THE DOOR FOR A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS TO PROVIDE CONNECTIVITY IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES WHERE THE PRIVATE SECTOR CANNOT OR CHOOSES NOT TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT SERVICE. AB FOURTEEN PROVIDES FOR AN EXTENSION OF THE SURCHARGE ON THE TELECOM SERVICE AND BONDING FOR YEARS WHEN THE APPLICATIONS EXCEED THE INCOMING REVENUE THE BILL PROJECTS NOW. WELL WE WORK WITH LEADERSHIP AND THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE EXACT METHOD FOR EXTENDING THE WIRELINE CUSTOMERS WILL ACTUALLY BE WILL ACTUALLY DECREASE IN THE NEW PROGRAM. MY BILL ENSURES GRANTS ADMINISTERED BY THE CPUC COMMISSIONERS ARE AWARDED TO APPLICANTS WHO ARE WILLING. AND ABLE TO QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY CONNECT HOUSEHOLDS COMMUNITY ANCHOR INSTITUTIONS SMALL BUSINESSES AND EMPLOYERS BY MAKING ELIGIBLE ANCHOR INSTITUTIONS ALONG THE PATHWAY OF A PROJECT SO THAT WE DO NOT MISS OPPORTUNITIES TO BROAD LINKAGES. TO HEALTH EDUCATION PUBLIC SAFETY AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE RESEARCH FACILITIES. WE HAVE ALSO HAD AN OPPORTUNITY CREATE THOUSANDS OF JOBS FOR MORE CALIFORNIA WORKERS WHO WILL NEED TO HAVE THE SKILLS AND TRAINING TO DELIVER THESE PROJECTS. AND AS WE WORK WITH MISTER SPEAKER AND THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE FINAL PACKAGE I'M EXCITED TO CONTINUE OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE STATE BUILDING TRADES A COMMUNICATIONS WORKERS. FOR SURE CALIFORNIA WORKERS BENEFIT FROM THESE HIGH PAYING CAREERS IN TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE. A GREAT MANY OF US ARE WORKING ON DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THIS FIGHT TOGETHER WE'VE BUILT THE MOMENTUM TO SUCCEED THIS YEAR. NOW IS THE TIME TO SEIZE THE MOMENT AND BRING ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS INTO THE TWENTY FIRST SIX CENTURY FOR THEIR WORK HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE IN WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY IS TRISH KELLY ON BEHALF OF VALLEY VISION AND EDUARDO GONZALEZ. I'M BEHALF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY REGIONAL BROADBAND CONSORTIUM AND FRESNO STATE THANK YOU. K. OPERATOR COULD WE- LIST EITHER EDUARDO OR TRASH. CUEBALL FINDS THEIR OPEN. NOW GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS TRISH KELLY COMPELLING VISION MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR DEDICATED LEADERSHIP TO CLOSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE OVER THE YEARS INCLUDING CRITICALLY NEEDED BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE FOR OUR CAPITAL REGION AND STATEWIDE ALSO THANK YOU FOR YOUR COLLABORATION WITH SENATOR GONZALEZ AND THE MANY ASSEMBLY MEMBERS TO CONNECT OUR UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED HOUSEHOLDS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. URGENCY LEGISLATION WITH AT FOURTEEN. WELL YOUR VISION MA'AM THE CONNECTED CAPITAL AREA BROADBAND CONSORTIUM WHICH IS ONE OF THE TWELVE CONSORTIUM FUNDED BY THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND. AND THEY WORK THROUGH THIS WORK WE WORK WITH PROVIDERS TO CONNECT THE 98% OF OUR HOUSEHOLDS IN THE REGION BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. YOUR BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THE REGION HAS UP MORE THAN THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND UNSERVED HOUSEHOLDS AT THIS MOMENT AS DEFINED BY THE BEAUTY AND WE KNOW THE NUMBER IS HIGHER WHEN WE CONDUCT SPEED TESTING AND VALIDATE ACTUAL VERSUS REPORTED LEVELS OF SPEED AND SERVICE. WE ALSO MENTION MANAGE THAT SACRAMENTO COALITION FOR DIGITAL INCLUSION ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO THE LIBRARY THE STATE SECTOR ST LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT ARE WORKFORCE BOARDS AND PVO. THIS WORK IS FOCUSED ON BROADBAND ACCESS AND ADOPTION. AFFORDABLE SERVICES AND DEVICES. AND DIGITAL AND- SO WE SEE ALL ASPECTS OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE WHICH IS HUGE. AT THE CURRENT RATE OF COLLECTIONS FOR THE P. YOU FEED CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND WHICH FUNDED BENEFITS STRUCTURE IT WOULD TAKE A HUNDRED YEARS FOR US TO MEET THE 98% GOAL ACROSS THE STATE. ESTIMATED RIGHT NOW BY THE P. SEE A CLOSE TO SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. THE GAPS IN OUR REGION IS HUGE IT WOULD COST A MINIMUM OF ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR US TO CONNECT OUR UNSERVED HELPFUL. NOT TO MENTION THE THOUSANDS OF UNDERSERVED HELPFUL IN- ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED URBAN NEIGHBORHOODS. THE FUND IS ALSO OR WITH DESCRIBES DEMONSTRATING THE HIGH DEMAND.FOR THIS THE FUNDING RESOURCE. THEREFORE WE CANNOT REACH OUR BUDGETS. MANDATED 8% TARGET WITHOUT CONTINUED CAPTIVE FUNDING. WHICH WILL TAKE SEVERAL YEARS BEYOND TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WE SUPPORTED THE FOURTEEN BECAUSE IT WILL PROVIDE FOR CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN HIGH NEED INFRASTRUCTURE IN BOTH URBAN AND RURAL AREAS EXPAND FUNDING ELIGIBILITY INCLUDING FOR LOCAL AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. AND THIS WILL ENABLE NEW SOLUTIONS WHERE THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS NOT INVESTING WILL ALSO AS MENTIONED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER AG WE ARE CURRY CONNECT ANCHOR INSTITUTIONS ALONG THE PATH OF DEPLOYMENT. AND IT WILL IMPROVE THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM SO PROJECTS ARE COMPLETED SOONER. I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT THE P. YOU SEE COST MODEL DOES NOT INCLUDE ESTIMATES TO CONNECT UNDERSERVED HOUSEHOLDS. AND THIS IS A GREAT NEED TO WHICH WE SEEM TO THE PANDEMIC ESPECIALLY FOR HELP OPEN STUDENTS STRUGGLING TO CONNECT FOR DISTANCE LEARNING WE WILL WORK TELL HEALTH AND EMERGENCY SERVICES AND SO MUCH MORE. WE KNOW IN OUR REGION WE'VE LOST THOUSANDS OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS ALONE DUE TO THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE INTERNET DEVICES AND ACCESS TO BROADBAND. WE'VE ALSO ESTIMATED THE COST TO CONNECT OUR UNSERVED BUSINESS LOCATIONS THAT. ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. SO A LOT OF IN THE IS. IT'S A HUGE GAP AND WE NEED- ALL THE RESOURCES WE CAN TO MEET THIS CRITICAL GOAL. CHAPTER IS A REALLY TRULY IMPORTANT RESOURCE FOR THE REGION'S TO MEET OUR LEGISLATIVE MANDATE. I NOTE THAT THE LEGISLATION IS FOR AN EXTENSION OF THE CURRENT SURCHARGE IT'S AN EXTREMELY SMALL AMOUNT ON YOUR PHONE BILL. BASED ON YOUR BILL RANGING BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY TWENTY AND FORTY PERCENT. TWENTY AND FORTY CENTS MONTHLY. MY MONTHLY CHARGES ON MY PHONE BILLS FOR ITEMS LIKE CALL WAITING MESSAGING AND CALLER ID ARE FAR FAR HARDER SO I WOULD RATHER PUT MY MONEY. INTO CONNECTING ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS. SO WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL- CONSIDER THAT AND SUPPORT THIS BILL ARE WE HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF MOMENTUM TO MEET THE DIGITAL DIVIDE CHALLENGE. AND HELP DRIVE ECONOMIC RECOVERY THIS LEGISLATION IS SUPPORTED BY AN EXTREMELY BROAD NETWORK OF ORGANIZATIONS STATEWIDE. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST. YOUR IPHONE AND THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME SAID A LOT OF THE ONCE ON THIS REPRESENTING THE OFFICE OF COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY FRESNO. WHICH ADMINISTERS THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY REGIONAL BROADBAND CONSTRUCTION. AS MENTIONED BEFORE ONE IN EIGHT CALIFORNIA HOME STILL DO NOT HAVE INTERNET ACCESS. IN THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS OUR CONSORTIA WORKING CLOSELY WITH LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS AND PARTNERS HAVE IDENTIFIED MORE THAN SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS. AND EIGHT COUNTY REGION WITH LIMITED OR NO ACCESS TO BROADBAND. THESE HOUSEHOLDS OF BOTH URBAN. AND RURAL LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS MAKING THE BROADBAND DIGITAL DIVIDE IN CALIFORNIA AN EQUITY ISSUE. TODAY I'M HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS TO SUPPORT AB FOURTEEN AS A STRATEGIC SOLUTION TO CONNECTING STUDENTS. FAMILIES AND BUSINESS OWNERS WHO REMAIN DISCONNECTED UNDER CURRENT STANDARDS. IF BROADBAND HAD A TIME I WOULD SAY IT'S NOW. BUT HOW CAN WE FIX CALIFORNIA'S BROADBAND NEEDS WITH MINIMAL FUNDING CONTINUES BEARS TO DEPLOYMENT CREATED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR. ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY LIVE DEMOGRAPHICS ARE HOUSEHOLD INCOME MORE ENTITLED TO THE SAME PRIVILEGES THAT YOU AND I WALK. HAVE HOPE GETTING ONLINE AND SECURING AN ADEQUATE BROADBAND SPEED. APPARENTLY THAT'S NOT WHAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR BELIEVES. DOES THIS IS WHERE AB FOURTEEN COMES TO PLAY OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE CONNECTIVITY. AND THEY'RE ALL COMMUNITIES WHERE THE PRIVATE SECTOR CANNOT OR CHOOSES NOT TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT SERVICE. AB FOURTEEN PROVIDES FOR AN EXTENSION OF THE SURCHARGE ON TELECOM SERVICE AND BODY FOR YEARS. ADDITIONALLY AS MENTIONED BEFORE AB FOURTEEN INSURANCE GRANTS ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OUR WATER TO APPLICANTS WHO ARE WILLING AND ABLE. TO QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY CONNECT CONSULS COMMUNITY ANCHOR INSTITUTIONS SMALL BUSINESSES EMPLOYERS TO- BY MAKING ELIGIBLE ANCHORS JUST ALONG THE PATHWAY OF A PROJECT SO CALIFORNIANS. DON'T MISS OPPORTUNITIES TO PROVIDE LINKAGES. TO HELP JOB TWENTY AT. ACCESS PUBLIC SAFETY EMERGES RESPONSE WAS. AND FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST RIGHT BOOK.
