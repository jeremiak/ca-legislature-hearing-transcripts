AND BEGIN A SUBCOMMITTEE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. COLLEAGUES -- I APPRECIATE YOUR EXTEND IN THE COURTESY TO LET ME GO FIRST. I AND CERTAINLY THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SB. FOUR FIFTY ONE THIS MEASURE WOULD CREATE AN INCENTIVE FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A TAX CREDIT FOR THE PRESERVATION AND REHABILITATION OF HISTORIC BUILDINGS IN CALIFORNIA. IF ENACTED CALIFORNIA WOULD JOIN THIRTY FIVE OTHER STATES WITH STATE HISORIC TAX CREDIT PROGRAMS. THE BENEFITS OF SUCH A CREDIT ARE WELL DOCUMENTED. I WILL HIGHLIGHT JUST A FEW HOUSING PROJECTS THAT RECEIVE THE FEDERAL VERSION OF THE TAX CREDIT. BECAUSE THESE ARE THE TYPES OF PROJECTS -- WOULD. FURTHER BENEFIT FROM A STATE CREDIT. ONE SUCH EXAMPLE IS IN MY DISTRICT THE HISTORIC SAN DIEGO ATHLETIC CLUB BUILDING WAS TURNED INTO CONNECTIONS HOUSING. WHICH NOW PROVIDES TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THREE APARTMENTS WITH SUPPORT OF SERVICES TO THE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS POPULATION. IN ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOOSE DISTRICT THE SAN FRANCISCO YMCA BUILDING WAS RESTORED TO CONVERT FORMER HOTEL ROOMS IN TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO SUPPORT OF HOUSING UNITS FOR CHRONICALLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. THE FACILITY STILL HOUSES A COMMUNITY JAM AN AUDITORIUM WHILE ALSO PROVIDING HEALTH IN SUPPORT OF SERVICES TO THE CITY'S HOMELESS POPULATION. BY ENABLING CALIFORNIANS TO LEVERAGE THE FEDERAL REHABILITATION TAX CREDITS IT'S OUR HOPE THAT THIS MEASURE WOULD PROVIDE THE EXTRA INCENTIVE NECESSARY TO STIMULATE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INVESTMENTS. WHILE ALSO BUILDING CIVIC PRIDE AS WE CELEBRATE OUR HERITAGE AND PRESERVE CALIFORNIA'S PASSED. I HAVE A TWO WITNESSES MADAM CHAIR WITH ME TODAY TO OFFER THEIR EXPERTISE AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE.

THE FERRY BUILDING SAN FRANCISCO ORPHEUM THEATRE IN LOS ANGELES CENTRAL YMCA SAN FRANCISCO THE FOREMAN INGLEWOOD. LIBERTY STATION SAN DIEGO.

NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX IN CALIFORNIA SINCE 2000738% OF ALL FEDERAL HISTORIC TAX CREDIT PROJECTS CREATED NEW HOUSING. AND THE OF THAT AMOUNT OVER HALF WERE AFFORDABLE.

MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ON TONY GONZALEZ -- I REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA PRESERVATION FOUNDATION BUT TODAY. I'M HERE TO SHARE WITH YOU THE STRONG SUPPORT OF AS BEFORE FIFTY ONE BY THE CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND WE'RE GONNA TAKE A BRIEF PAUSE WE HAVE A QUORUM IS HIGHLY WE CALL THE ROLL BURKE HERE [inaudible] ROBERT [inaudible] CHU GRAY. MAYES MELENDEZ MULLIN PETRIE-NORRIS. WORK HERE RIVAS. KING THERE. OF COURSE. WE HAVE A QUORUM ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. REVENUE CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS PLAY JOHNSON HERE ABOUT THE STATE'S HAS A FEW ON A MOCK HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. START QUIRK -- SO THERE'S YOU HAVE PUT SOMETHING IN THERE THAT I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND -- AND THAT IS THAT YOU ALLOW US AN OWNER OCCUPIED BUILDING TO QUALIFY. AND MY CONCERN ABOUT THAT IS THE PEOPLE I KNOW WHO HAVE -- OWNER OCCUPIED BUILDINGS THEY WERE GONNA FIX THEM ANYWAY SO IT WOULD SEEM AS IF THIS IS GIVING MONEY FOR IT'S WHAT WE CALL THE FREE RIDER PROBLEM. IS THERE A PARTICULAR REASON YOU DECIDE TO INCLUDE THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK I'M SO GLAD YOU ASKED THAT QUESTION ALL RIGHT I'M YOU KNOW I I HAVE FOLLOWED COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FOR A NUMBER OF DECADES I SERVED ON THE CITY COUNCIL WAS A STAFF MEMBER. I'M QUITE FAMILIAR WITH -- HISTORIC HOMES IN COMMUNITIES WHERE -- PEOPLE WERE BASICALLY ABLE TO BUY THOSE HOMES IN THE SEVENTIES EIGHTIES NINETIES NOW THE FINANCIAL SITUATION IN OUR STATE IS MUCH DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF THE ABILITY TO OWN HOMES. THERE ARE MANY MIDDLE INCOME LOW TO MIDDLE INCOME FOLKS WHO ACTUALLY WERE ABLE TO BUY A HOME IN THE EARLY YEARS. THOSE HOMES ARE BE INTEGRATED BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY SO I TRIED TO PUT BUMPERS ARE PARAMETERS AROUND THE ABILITY. FOR INDIVIDUALS TO ACCESS THESE RESOURCES -- FOR INDIVIDUAL HOMES BUT I WANTED THEM STILL TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT I CAN SEND YOU A PICTURE ALTHOUGH I DON'T WANT -- TO DON'T WORRY I WILL DO IT PERSONALLY BUT I DON'T WANT TO EMBARRASS THE HOMEOWNER IN A HISTORIC NEIGHBORHOOD NEAR MY HOUSE. WHERE THIS INCREDIBLE HOME AND I HAPPEN TO KNOW -- THE INDIVIDUAL IS INCOME STRAPPED BUT THEY DIDN'T -- SELL THEIR HOME. AND SO I WANT TO BE PRESERVING THESE ARE SPANISH COLONIAL CRAFTSMEN EVERYTHING THAT IS CALIFORNIA HISTORIC. UP FOR THOSE WHO NEEDED AND IF THERE'S RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THIS COMMITTEE OR ANY WOULD HAVE UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT IS MY INTENT -- AS OPPOSED TO TRYING TO GIVE OUR HOMEOWNERS WHO YOU MIGHT THINK HAVE THE ABILITY TO TO DO THIS WORK AND I THINK WE LIMITED THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE WANT TO BE VERY CAREFUL AND ASSESS IT. GOING FORWARD BUT THAT WAS MY RATIONALE. RIGHT AND THEN -- SINCE HOUSING IS OUR BIG PROBLEM SHOULD HOUSING PROJECTS HAVE PRIORITY OVER OTHER PROJECTS WHEN YOU'VE LIMITED TO FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS -- POSSIBLY I MEAN I'M OPEN TO DISCUSSION BUT MY WITNESS HERE MENTIONED FOR EXAMPLE THE FERRY BUILDING IN SAN FRANCISCO AND I WOULD SAY IF YOU LOOK AT THAT BUILDING. ON THE INTENT THERE WAS ALSO TO DRIVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND IF YOU ARE ABLE TO GO IN YOU WILL SEE THAT MOST OF THE BUSINESSES THAT OCCUPY THE FERRY BUILDING. OUR LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES. AND SO I THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE ON THE CERTAINLY THE PROJECT CLEARLY I ALWAYS BELIEVE HOUSING. I WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THESE ARE OLD WAREHOUSES THAT HAVE BEEN CONVERTED THE WHY. OF THE BUILDING I REFERENCED IN SAN DIEGO I AM OPEN TO THAT CONVERSATION AS WELL BUT I THINK THE FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF IT ALSO BE AN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITY -- WAS THE INTENT YEAH. ALL RIGHT WELL THERE'S THERE'S STILL IS THE QUESTION OF FREE RIDERS. THINGS THAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED ANYWAY BUT I'LL LEAVE IT UP TO THE CHAIR. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS -- FOR MYSELF THANK YOU FOR BRINGING UP THE FORUM THREE OF ITS ABILITY REHABILITATION OF THE FORM HAS BEEN A HUGE ECONOMIC DRIVER FRANK AWAY THEN IT HAS LAUNCHED US INTO STADIUMS AND OTHER AMAZING OPPORTUNITIES SO THANK YOU FOR MENTIONING THAT. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I I THINK THAT'S MORE THAN ENOUGH AYE YOU UNDERSTAND MY INTENT I HAVE CERTAINLY BROUGHT THIS BILL FORWARD BEFORE I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THIS AS A LEVERAGING OPPORTUNITY FOR DEVELOPMENTS WHETHER IT BE -- FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING OUR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES I IT WITH A LOSS OF REDEVELOPMENT ARE WE HAD THOSE RESOURCES TO SPUR SOME OF THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT I THINK THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL TOOL ALONG WITH THE FEDERAL TOOL. I TO ACCOMPLISH A MULTITUDE OF THINGS I WOULD AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME NOT NOW I KNOW I HOPE THAT THIS COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIR. LOOKS AT THIS BILL FAVORABLY. THANK YOU AND IT IS FOR TESTIMONY ONLY BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THANKS. MOVING TO THE FILE ITEM TO SB ONE NINETY SIX SENATOR BELL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- THIS IS SB ONE NIGHT TO SIX WHICH IS THE COMMUNITY LAND TRUST PROJECT DEVELOPMENT BILL -- I WANT TO THANK THE STAFF -- FOR WORKING WITH US AND WE WILL AMEND THE BILL AS PER YOUR COMMITTEES POLICY AND STAFF RECOMMENDATION. THE BILL WILL CREATE A MORE PERMANENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR LOW AND MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES. BY PROVIDING PROPERTY TAX RELIEF FOR COMMUNITY LAND TRUST -- THERE'S NO SILVER BULLET. INVOLVING THE HOUSING CRISIS BUT COMMUNITY LAND TRUST OR PART OF THE SOLUTION. THESE ARE NONPROFIT HOUSING ORGANIZATIONS. THAT PROVIDE PERMANENTLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING. NOW THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE COMMUNITY LAND TRUST. WITH THE PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION FROM THE POINT OF PROPERTY ACQUISITION. TO THE POINT OF SALE FOR AFFORDABLE HOMES. THIS WILL BRING THE TREATMENT OF COMMUNITY LAND TRUSTS. IN LINE WITH OTHER COMMUNITY BASED NONPROFITS THAT BENEFITED FROM AN EXISTING WELFARE EXEMPTION.

START BURKE -- THERE'S A NUMBER OF SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THOSE. WELL I THINK THERE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS -- WE ACCEPT THEM -- THERE WAS -- SOME CONCERN ABOUT.

THANK YOU EVERYBODY -- ORIGINAL VOTE ON THIS ONE APPROPRIATE TIME COMES THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION -- SENATOR HUESO FILE ITEM THREE SB. FOUR TWENTY TWO WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS -- THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME PERCENT SB. FOUR TWENTY TWO I WILL BE ACCEPTED IN -- THE AMENDED LANGUAGE WHICH WILL BRING OUR BILL INTO COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION FORTY ONE OF THE TAXI. REVENUE AND TAXATION CODE. SB FORTY FORTY TWO CREATES. AN EMPLOYER TAX CREDIT WHICH WILL ALLOW QUALIFIED EMPLOYER WHO HIRES A FORMERLY INCARCERATED YOUTH [inaudible] FULL TIME. OKAY A CREDIT IN AMOUNT OF EQUAL OF 50% OF QUALIFIED WAGES PAID BY THE TAXPAYER. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT IT COSTS ROUGHLY SIXTY THOUSAND A YEAR TO INCARCERATE A PRISONER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IF THIS PROGRAM KEEPS. TWELVE YOUNG EX OFFENDERS FROM RE OFFENDING THEN THIS PROGRAM ACROSS THE STATE NOTHING IN TAX REVENUE. GIVEN THE SOCIAL BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH. AN EX OFFENDER NOT GOING BACK TO PRISON ULTIMATELY THE SAVINGS WOULD BE EVEN GREATER. AS MANY OF YOU IF YOU KNOW. THE A NUMBER OF AMERICANS OF COMING CUT CONTACT WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. HAS A X. INCREASE EXPONENTIALLY BETWEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY AND TWO THOUSAND NINE CALIFORNIA'S. IN THAT PERIOD CALIFORNIA'S PRISON POPULATION INCREASE FIVE HUNDRED AND 83%. FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THAT GO TO PRISON -- SOMETIMES WITH -- MINOR OFFENSES THEY CAN -- THEY CAN FIND THEMSELVES IN A IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY THEY PAY THAT PENALTY FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. ANY SENTENCE IN OUR SOCIETY IS A LIFE SENTENCE WHICH USUALLY RESULTS IN THESE KIDS -- RETURNING TO PRISON AT AN ENORMOUS COST TO TAXPAYERS. WE HAVE -- TO BELIEVE THIS IN A SOCIETY WE HAVE TO BELIEVE IN REDEMPTION AND GIVE OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO REFORM THEMSELVES TO RECAST THEMSELVES. TO RE ENTER SOCIETY IS SUCCESSFULLY. AND HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A LIVING. THIS BILL WILL -- THE ONE EXTRA STEP IN OUR OUR PROCESS OF HOT HAVING TO REFORM A YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY AND GIVEN THEM A PATH -- AND WROTE A NEW DIRECTION AND A NEW PATH TO ACHIEVING THE AMERICAN DREAM. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY I HAVE A READ AT IS REPRESENTS CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL CONSERVATION COURSE YEARS JOINING ME THANK YOU. THE YOU WITH YOUR PERMISSION MADAM CHAIR. WIN ASSISTANCE SUPPORT AT THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS READ OUT ASSEMBLY HALF THE LOCAL CONSERVATION CORPS IS FOURTEEN COURSE THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SERVING THE VULNERABLE POPULATION AND HELPING TO REMOVE TO KEEP BARRIERS AND THANKS TO YOUR LEADERSHIP OVER THE YEARS YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO THE LOCAL CORES THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REMOVE THESE TWO BARRIERS. ONE RELATING TO EDUCATION TYPICALLY A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WE WORK WITH OR DROP OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. A ONE OF OUR GOALS IS TO GIVE THEM A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION. TWO THEY TYPICALLY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF JOB EXPERIENCE AND SO WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO IS ACTUALLY GIVEN THAT JOB EXPERIENCE BY GETTING THEM OUT ON PROJECTS AND SOON AND THAT WE WERE ABLE TO GIVE THEM BOTH THE JOB EXPERIENCE. AND THE EDUCATION THEY NEED TO BE PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY. HOWEVER WE HAVE INCREASINGLY SEEN A PROBLEM WITH SOME OF OUR CORE MEMBERS WHO -- WERE WITHIN THE PAROLE SYSTEM AND BASICALLY WHAT THAT MEANS IS WHEN THEY LEAVE CARS -- PROGRAM AND THEY GO TO A PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYER THEY'RE FINDING THAT THAT IS AN ADDITIONAL BARRIER. THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE GONE THROUGH OUR PROGRAM THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO GET THAT KIND OF JOB. IT IS THEREFORE TODAY WE APPRECIATE THE THE CENTER HUESO IS LEADERSHIP ON THIS MEASURE WHICH WE THINK WILL GO A LONG WAY. AND REMOVING THAT BARRIER IN CREATING AN INCENTIVE FOR SOME THE FOLKS WHO COME TO OUR PROGRAM TO GET A JOB AND BE GAINFULLY EMPLOYED THANK YOU. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. CNN COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE DOCTOR QUIRK. SO WE HAVE SOME AREAS OF THE STATE OUR PENINSULA THERE'S A 3% UNEMPLOYMENT RATE THE EAST BAY IT'S AROUND -- FOUR FIVE WHERE IN YOUR AREA HOWEVER IT'S PROBABLY AROUND 20%. I WOULD THINK THAT THIS TAX CREDIT. MIGHT MAKE SENSE WELL THE QUESTION IS ARE YOU CREATING JOBS AND TO THE EXTENT YOUR GRADING THEM DO THEY GO -- TO THE PEOPLE YOU'RE TRYING -- TO TO REACH -- AND I JUST THINK THAT YOUR AREA OF THE STATE NEEDS A LOT MORE THAN MY AREA OF THE STATE BUT THERE'S YOU KNOW I I ONE THING YOU MIGHT THINK ABOUT IS DOES IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO DO THIS IN AN AREA. I WOULD BE WORRIED THAT. FRANKLY IN MY AREA WHERE THERE ARE ALREADY PEOPLE. DESPERATE TO HIRE. AND THE BUILDING TRADES ARE ABSOLUTELY TRYING TO GET EVERYONE THEY CAN AND THEY'RE WILLING TO TAKE PEOPLE WHO HAVE -- FELONIES ON THEIR RECORD AND IN FACT -- I KNOW SOME PEOPLE IN THE CARPENTERS WHO. WHO BASICALLY HAD THEIR WHITE LIGHTS? LIVES TURNED AROUND. I WOULD THINK THAT THIS IS APPROPRIATE IN SOME AREAS OF THE STATE BUT PROBABLY NOT IN MY HOME TOWN AWAY. THE AREA I REPRESENT. AND A COMMON WELL I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH AND REGARDLESS OF WHERE THESE INDIVIDUALS LIVE THE STATISTIC IS PRETTY -- EQUAL ACROSS THE STATE THAT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE TEND TO RECIDIVISM. AT ABOUT AT A RATE OF ABOUT 70% REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY LIVE IN THE STATE SO. YEAH BUT WOULD IT. WOULD THIS EFFECT THAT RECIDIVISM RATE IN A PLACE WHERE I CAN ASSURE YOU WHENEVER I GO TO A SMALL BUSINESS IN MY AREA. THEY'RE ALWAYS SAYING LOOK WHAT WE WANT. IS SOMEONE WHO WILL COME IN ON TIME AND DO WHAT THEY'RE TOLD IT'S A SIMPLE AS THAT WE WANT PEOPLE AT THIS VERY BASIC LEVEL. AND THEY SAY THEY ARE WILLING TO TAKE ON PEOPLE LIKE THIS SO. OUR OUR BILL IS A PILOT. WE WANT WHAT WE IT'S A PILOT PROGRAM IT HELLO OKAY DATE. SO IT'S NOT REYES THE PILOT GOING TO TAKE PLACE -- STATE WIDE [inaudible] SO. TWO YEARS SUNSET YEAH. ARM WILL YOU BE COLLECTING THE DATA WE NEED TO SEE WHERE IT'S EFFECTIVE IN WHERE IT ISN'T. I GUESS THAT'S ONE OF ASIAN AND ASIAN SALEABLE TO US BUT AT THE BILL DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE THAT REQUIREMENT TO COLLECT. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU LOOK AT GETTING THE DATA TO SEE. AND I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY IT'S EASY FOR ME TO SAY THIS IS HARDER TO PUT IT INTO ACTUAL LANGUAGE. BUT IF YOU -- IF THIS BILL DOES GO FORWARD I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO SEE WHERE IT'S USEFUL AND WHERE IT ISN'T AND I SUSPECT THAT THERE ARE PLACES IN THE STATE. WHERE IT'LL BE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE THAN IN OTHER PLACES IN PARTICULAR I THINK MORE IN YOUR DISTRICT THAN MINE? BECAUSE YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE JUST LOOKING FOR AND WHERE I AM PARTICULARLY IN THE BUILDING TRADES JUST LOOKING FOR SOMEONE. TO TO FILL THESE POSITIONS AND THEY'RE WILLING TO TAKE PEOPLE AND AND HAVE TAKEN PEOPLE WHO DO HAVE RECORDS. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS WITH ME ASSEMBLYMEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS. WHAT IS THE CURRENT PLAN FOR MEASURING EFFICACY OF THE PILOT SO THAT AFTER TWO YEARS WE CAN DETERMINE? IF IT'S EFFECTIVE AND IF WE'RE GONNA ROLL IT OUT. WELL WE HAVE A I'M BEEN EXPLAINED THAT THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD WILL. BE PROVIDING THAT INFORMATION. TO WHAT WHAT INFORMATION. THE HA HA THE UTILIZATION RATE OF THE PROGRAM OKAY. AND THAT THAT WOULD GIVE US ENOUGH INFORMATION TO ASSESS HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE. EMPLOYED IN THE PROGRAM AND HOW LONG THEY STAY IN THE PROGRAM. IN CERTAIN AS PART OF KIND OF THIS COMMITTEE'S FRAMEWORK WE PART OF WHAT PEOPLE SUBMIT IS KIND OF A A PLAN FOR MEASUREMENT AND DATA COLLECTION CRIMES TO SECTION FORTY ONE IS THE INTENTION. OF WHAT THE GOOD WHAT THE GOALS ARE THAT'S WHAT SECTION FORTY ONE BASICALLY **** FOR METRIC SINGLES IT'S NOT NECESSARILY DATA COLLECTION. GOT IT IS THE PROPOSED METRIC SINGLES. YEAH I WOULD DEFINITELY I WOULD WILL ECHOED DOCTOR CORKS COMMENT THAT ASSESSING WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS AN EFFECTIVE PROGRAM ISN'T JUST. YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF FOLKS THAT HAVE TAKEN IT UP FOR THE NUMBER OF COMPANIES THAT HAVE TAKEN IT UP BATES. ACTUAL DATA ON IT RICK RECIDIVISM. AND AS HIRING RATES COMPARED TO BASELINE SO FOR US THAT DB DATA WOULD QUALIFY FOR SECTION. FORTY ONE SUGGEST THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT TAKEN IT UP WOULD QUALIFY AS A MEASUREMENT OKAY. YEAH I WOULD. I KNOW YOU PI LIKE MORE DETAILS WHICH WOULD BE FANTASTIC I THINK BUT AND AND NOT SOMETHING THE AUTHOR CAN CONSIDER AND IS OF I THINK A QUALIFIED COMMENT. HOWEVER I WILL TELL YOU THAT AS SOMEBODY YES THE CARPENTERS DO REGULARLY WANT TO AYE HI ARE OPEN. TO HIRING THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED HOWEVER THERE ARE. A PLETHORA OF OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN THOSE PROGRAMS AND ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE SURE. THAT YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME AND NOW A LOT OF WHICH YOU HAVE SOFT SKILLS WERE TALKING ABOUT IN THE BUDGET -- WORD -- GIVING MONEY TO IS A PROGRAM CALLED THE CHALLENGER PROGRAM WHICH IS ACTUALLY TO DO SOMETHING JUST LIKE THIS IT'S TO TAKE KIDS WHO ARE COMING OUT OF JUVENILE FACILITIES AND MAKE SURE. THAT THEY HAVE TRAINING WHILE THEY'RE THERE SO THAT THEY GO STRAIGHT INTO A JOB BUT FOR THOSE KIDS WHO ARE NOT PART OF THAT THREE HUNDRED BED PILOT PROGRAM. THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO DON'T WHO ARE GOING TO BE CARPENTERS WHO ARE WILLING PART PART OF THAT ARE PART OF PIPEFITTERS OR SOME OF THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO TAKE FOLKS THAT ARE THAT HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED. THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE A NEW PATH. AND THE PATH TO RECIDIVISM IS NOT JUST A PATH OF TRAINING INSIDE THE PRISONS BUT IT IS ALSO A PATH TO WHERE THE YOU GO AFTERWARDS. YET NO LIKE I NEVER SAY HEAR YOU ON THAT I THINK. WHAT I WOULD CHALLENGE AND AND NOT JUST YOU I THINK FOR ALL OF US RIGHT THE WE NEVER HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO DO ALL THE THINGS THAT WE WANT TO DO SO? IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO MEASURE IT SO THAT WE CAN SAY. YOU KNOW IS THIS PILOT PROGRAM THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO SPEND THESE DOLLARS OR IS THERE NOTICES CHALLENGER PROGRAM A MORE EFFECTIVELY DOUBLE AND I THINK I WOULD EVEN JUST THE MOST MINIMAL DATA FROM FTP SAYING THAT THIS MANY COMPANIES TOOK IN. A HIRED YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WHO ARE HAVE BEEN THROUGH REHABILITATION WILL ACTUALLY GIVE YOU A MEASURE OF HOW MANY PEOPLE VERSUS HOW MANY DIDN'T LAST YEAR. SO I THINK THAT'S A START YES IF THEY WANT TO WORK WITH C. C. R. AND SEE IF THAT THERE'S A WAY TO COLLECT MORE DETAILED INFORMATION OR PROBATION TO WORK ON MORE DETAILED INFORMATION I THINK THAT IS. AS DOCTOR CLARK SAID A MUCH MORE COMPLICATED PROCESS THERE'S PRIVACY ISSUES TRUST ME WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THIS -- AND THEY'VE HAD REPORTS FROM PROBATION DEPARTMENT OF THIS YEAR TO TALK ABOUT THE KIND OF THE CHALLENGES OF COLLECTING THAT DATA. BUT I THINK FROM FTV AT LEAST AS A START TO KNOW IF FIVE COMPANIES USED IT UTILIZED IT OR A HUNDRED COMPANIES UTILIZED IT WILL AT LEAST GIVE US AN IDEA INTO YOUR SUPPORT GOING DOWN THE RIGHT PATH. AND THAT IS IN THEIR SECTION ONE AMENDMENT THAT IS NOT IN THERE NOW BUT THAT THEY ARE WORKING ON AN AND IF I CAN JUST -- YOU KNOW NOW THAT I'VE HAD A CHANCE TO KIND OF UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE JUST JUST TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE HISTORY OF WHERE WE CAME UP WITH THIS BILL -- THIS STATE USED TO HAVE AN ENTERPRISE ZONE PROGRAM THAT -- WE LARGELY DISMANTLED IN TERMS OF HOW -- WHAT? WHAT BUSINESSES ARE ENTITLED TO A TAX CREDIT AND IN WHERE THAT THAT IS CONDUCTED THAT WAS THERE WAS A REFORM THAT HAPPEN AROUND -- TWENTY THIRTEEN AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE -- IN TERMS OF GATHERING GAS GATHERING DATA THROUGH THAT PROGRAM STILL EXISTS. THAT'S HOW WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ASSESS HOW MUCH OF THOSE TAX DOLLARS ARE ACTUALLY BEING DRAWN. AND AND USED IN UNDERSERVED AREAS. WE HAD ORIGINALLY ENVISIONED THAT THERE WOULD BE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DRAWN DOWN WHICH IS I MEAN THE NUMBER USED TO BE CLOSER TO NINE HUNDRED MILLION -- WE THAT NUMBER WE EXPECTED WILL GO DOWN TO ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION IT HAS ACTUALLY GONE DOWN TO ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION. THOSE ARE MONIES THAT WERE TENSION LEE -- INTENDED TO HELP CREATE EMPLOYMENT HELP CREATE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE A LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND% UNDERSERVED AREAS. SO THIS PROGRAM WOULD SIMPLY -- WORKED INTO THE STRUCTURE OF THAT ENTIRE ENTERPRISE. ZONE -- PROGRAM THAT STILL LARGELY INTACT SO WOULD ALLOW US TO TRACK. WHAT'S BEING DRAWN DOWN WHERE AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE. SO -- ALL WE'RE DOING IS BASICALLY ANSWERED IN THIS POLICY AND TO THAT TAX CODE. AND THAT -- FRAMEWORK THAT ALREADY EXISTS AND HOPING THAT WE GET WE GET SOME RESULTS THAT THE PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO ARE DRAWN THIS PROGRAM STAY OUT OF PRISON GET A JOB. AND ESTABLISH THAT HISTORY. TO EVENTUALLY HELP THEM -- TO ONCE THEY GET -- BEYOND A CERTAIN AGE LIMIT. TO GO OFF ON THEIR OWN ESTABLISH THAT WORK HISTORY SO I THINK EVERYBODY EVERYTHING THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THIS PROGRAM CAN BE. NOT ONLY MARKETED BUT UTILIZED EMPLOYED AND AND TRACK IS ALREADY IN PLACE UNDER OUR OUR STATES. TAX CODE AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES -- WE JUST WANNA -- GIVE THIS A TRY I THINK -- THIS BILL WOULD GIVE US. ENOUGH TIME TO PUT IT INTO A FACT TO SEE IF IT IS UTILIZED AND CONSIDER LOOK AT LATER DATE TO SEE HOW SUCCESSFUL IT IS. TO SEE IF WE WANT EMPLOY CONTINUE TO PLAY IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU. DOCTOR FORGET A QUESTION -- I'LL BE VERY BRIEF. I THINK WHAT WE BOTH WANT TO DO IS SEE WHAT HAPPENED THE TWO YEARS BEFORE. AND WHAT HAPPENED TO TWO YEARS LATER AND IT'S NOT JUST -- THE AMOUNT TAKEN UP IT'S WAS THERE AN INCREASE ARE WE REALLY SERVING MORE PEOPLE. ARE WE JUST SEEING THAT THE PLACES THAT ALREADY HAVE LOW UNEMPLOYMENT ARE JUST USING IT A LOT AND PLACES THAT. DON'T DON'T USE IT. AND SO THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH OF A CHANGE THAT'S THE MAIN THING I THINK WE'RE BOTH CONCERNED ABOUT WE WANT TO SEE CHANGE. WHERE PARTICULARLY PLACES WITH HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT SEE A A MEASURE? OF INCREASING JOBS. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. AND I'D BE I'D BE. MORE THAN GLAD TO SUBMIT A LETTER TO THE GENERAL JOURNAL TO THAT EFFECT IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD PLEASE YOU SURE THANK YOU. AND ALSO JUST FOR THE RECORD THIS IS BASED ON AND IT'S ALSO BASED ON THE NEW EMPLOYMENT CREDIT WHICH THEIR NUMBER FOR VISIONS TO GUARD AGAINST ANY SORT OF ABUSE. OF USING THE CREDIT SO THAT IS IN PLACE AS WELL IN THE BILL. I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU THAT FOR SOMEONE FROM MY COMMUNITY. SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT -- PEOPLE SAY ALL THE TIME THAT THEY BE WILLING. TO HIRE EX OFFENDERS AND WHEN IT ACTUALLY COMES TIME TO DO IT THEY DON'T ALWAYS DO IT AS MAFIC THEY RARELY DO. AND SO ANY INCENTIVE WE CAN GIVE EMPLOYERS TO MOVE THEM IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I AM HAPPY. TO BE PART OF AND SO IT WHEN THE TIME COMES I WOULD LOVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE A CO AUTHOR ON THIS. AND WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THE JUST SIMPLY I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE AN ADDITIONAL TOOL. IN THE TOOL BELT OF OF THIS COMMUNITY. IN IN IN WORKING WITH OUR LOCAL CONSERVATION COURSE AT WORK WITH EDUCATING THESE YOUNG PEOPLE PREPARING THEM PROVIDING OF TRAINING. THEY SAY THEIR NUMBER ONE BARRIER TO GETTING THESE -- A YOUNG PEOPLE PLACED ON A JOB IS THEIR PAST HISTORY. AND AND GETTING BEYOND THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT AT THAT LEVEL AND OUR LOCAL CONSERVATION COURSE OR STATEWIDE. THEY'RE ALSO IN THE BAY AREA AND THEY ALSO -- BRING FORTH THE SAME CHALLENGES. ON ALL. THEY THEY BOTH -- EXPRESS THE SAME CHALLENGES TO THAT THAT SPECIFIC COHORTS SO. WE'RE GIVEN A SHOT WE'RE HOPING THAT THIS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL WE HOPE THAT THIS COULD -- BEGIN -- A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM OF REVERSING A TREND IN HELPING PEOPLE TO TO GET ON A MORE PRODUCTIVE PATH IN THEIR LIVES. YOUR SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU THIS ITEM FOR TESTIMONY ONLY BUT WE APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU -- WOMEN FILE ITEM ONE SB THIRTY FOUR SENATOR WIENER WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR -- I'M TO IMPRISONING SENATE BILL -- THIRTY FOUR THE DENNIS PERON A BROWNIE MARY ACTS -- WHICH WILL ENSURE THAT -- COMPASSIONATE CARE MEDICAL CANNABIS PROGRAMS PROGRAMS THAT. ARE GIVE. OCT MEDICAL CANNABIS AWAY FOR FREE TO LOW INCOME PATIENTS. ARE CAN CONTINUE TO SURVIVE -- THIS. MEASURE I DID PASS OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR -- AND OUT OF THE ENTIRE LEGISLATURE WITH OVERWHELMING BIPARTISAN SUPPORT UNFORTUNATELY OUR FORMER GOVERNOR BE TODAS SO WE ARE BACK BECAUSE THIS IS ABOUT. ENSURING PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO MEDICINE ARE WE WILL BE -- AS AUTHOR AMENDMENTS MAKING AMENDMENTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WAS REQUESTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS SO WE ARE HAVING THOSE DRAFTED RIGHT NOW. SO COLLEAGUES FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW BACK IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES -- DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE THE WORST OF THE AIDS EPIDEMIC IN SAN FRANCISCO. OUR COMPASSION PROGRAMS CAME INTO EXISTENCE TO GOD SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR MEDICINE -- OVER TIME THESE PROGRAMS HAVE -- PROVIDED ACCESS TO MEDICINE TO SO MANY PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV CANCER. MANY VETERANS WITH PTSD AND OTHER PROBLEMS WHO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STOP USING PHARMACEUTICALS AND OPIOIDS AS A RESULT OF THIS. OUR CHILDREN WITH RARE DISEASES AND SAW AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF ELEMENTS OF FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LOW INCOME WHO CAN BENEFIT -- WITH THE LEGALIZATION OF ADULT USE OF CANNABIS -- WHAT WE'VE SEEN AS -- I THOUGHT CANNABIS IS NOT CHEAP. ARE WHEN YOU GET IT THE LEGAL WAY IT'S NOT CHEAP. I AND IT WHEN PROP SIXTY FOUR WAS PASSED WE BELIEVE THIS WAS AN ADVISER AND THAT -- THE HI STATE TAXES WERE IMPOSED ON THESE COMPASSION PROGRAMS WHICH OF COURSE HAVE NO REVENUE BECAUSE THEY DON'T SELL ANYTHING. SPENCER COMPASSION PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN CLOSING DOWN I AND MY DISTRICT AND OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE REVENUE TO PAY. THE TAXES AND WHAT THIS DOES IS IT REDUCES ACCESS -- BY VETERANS AND PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV AND OTHER PEOPLE -- BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD -- THAT OUGHT TO PAY FOR WHAT IS LEGAL -- AND THEY END UP GOING ON THE BLACK MARKET WHICH OF COURSE NONE OF US WANTS FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS AND IS NOT GOOD FOR THE CONSUMER. IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE STATE. I SAID THIS BILL -- WILL RELIEVE -- WILL WAIVE TAXES -- FOR THESE -- PROGRAMS I WILL SAY THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS TECHNICALLY -- A REDUCTION IN TAXES OR TAX CREDIT PROGRAM BUT TO BE VERY CLEAR. THESE ARE ILLUSORY TAX COLLECTIONS THESE. THESE TAXES WILL NEVER -- ACTUALLY EXISTS BECAUSE THESE PROGRAMS WILL SIMPLY SHUT DOWN TO THE STATE IS NOT GOING TO GET EVEN IF WE DON'T PASS THIS IS NOT GOING TO GET ANY OF THESE TOXICITIES ARE IMAGINARY TAXES.

TERRA GALGIANI SECTION. FILE ITEM SIX SB SEVEN SIXTY THREE WHICH LIKE TO OPEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO TO HELP VICTIMS OF OUR WILD FIRES WHO HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES IN THEIR ENTIRETY OR HAVE LOST SO MUCH OF THEIR HOME. THAT THEY ARE UNABLE TO KEEP IT -- SB SEVEN SIXTY THREE PROVIDES THAT DISCHARGES OF RESIDENTS INDEBTEDNESS OCCURRING ON OR AFTER JANUARY FIRST. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND BEFORE JANUARY FIRST TWO THOUSAND NINE ARE EXCLUDED FROM AN INDIVIDUAL'S GROSS INCOME. THE MORTGAGE THAT IS EXCLUDED ONLY WHEN IT'S DUE THE LOSS OF RESIDENTS WITHIN A FEDERALLY DECLARED DISASTER AREAS SUCH AS THE WILD FIRES THAT WE SAW HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WHEN A LENDER CANCELS A BORROWER'S DEBT FEDERAL LAW TREATS THE AMOUNT OF DEBT CANCELLED AS TAXABLE INCOME FOR THE BORROWER? THIS PUTS VICTIMS OF NATURAL DISASTERS ON THE HOOK FOR PAYING LARGE SUMS IN TAXES WHEN THEY'RE MOST VULNERABLE AND IT'S NOT ACTUALLY INCOME IT'S PHANTOM INCOME THAT THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO SEE. SB SEVEN SIXTY THREE WOULD ENSURE THE COUNCIL MORTGAGE DEBTS FOR RESIDENCES IN A FEDERALLY DECLARED A DISASTER AREA WILL NOT BE TAXED AS INCOME HELPING CALIFORNIANS DURING THE MOST DIFFICULT TIME OF THEIR LIVES. MEMBERS THIS BODY PASSED SIMILAR LEGISLATION IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THAT APPLY TO YOU ANYONE WHO WAS -- DISCHARGING INDEBTEDNESS TO THEIR HOME BECAUSE OF A FORECLOSURE SHORT SALE AND AND THE GOVERNOR VETOED IT. THIS BODY ALSO DURING THE HOUSING FORECLOSURE CRISIS. DID SIMILAR LEGISLATION BECAUSE WE SAW SO MANY PEOPLE LOSING THEIR HOMES AND THEY WERE MAKING ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE BANKS AND IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AT THAT TIME WOULD THEN COME IN AND TAX THEM ON A LOSS OF MONEY THAT THEY NEVER EVER SAW. THIS IS LIMITED JUST TO THOSE WHO ARE WHILE FIRE VICTIMS AND VICTIMS OF OTHER FEDERALLY DECLARED DISASTERS. AND I'M WORKING CURRENTLY WITH LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL TO ENSURE THAT THE BILL CONFORMS TO SECTION FORTY ONE OF THE RATHER TAX CODE. THANK YOU WIN ASSISTANCE. FOR WHAT IS THE NUMBER SESSION COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE START BURKE. MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. THANK YOU FOR BRAIN ABILITY OF ANY AND THANK YOU -- FOR GETTING TO A SECTION FORTY ONE COMPLAINTS TO HAVE A CLOSING -- I JUST WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT I MENTIONED CAUCUS A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO THAT WE WOULD PROBABLY SEE PEOPLE LOSING THEIR HOMES BECAUSE OF THE RATE OF INSURANCE GOING UP EXPONENTIALLY. AND IF YOU HAVE IF YOU'RE USED TO PAYING A HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH IN OFFICE SAID YOUR INSURANCE GOES UP TO FIVE HUNDRED OR SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT PAYMENT ON TOP OF THE HOUSE PAYMENT. I PREDICTED THAT WE MIGHT SEE THIS AND INDEED WE ARE NOW SEEING THIS THIS PROBLEM OCCURS SO I APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL THAT'S FOR TESTIMONY ONLY BUT THING FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. THANK YOU [inaudible] WHERE TURNED
