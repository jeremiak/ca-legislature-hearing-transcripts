I ANSWERED A QUESTION OF WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING WITH THAT I PLAN ON BEING A LAWYER. ALSO ONE OF THE GOVERNORS OF THE SECRETARY GALLAGHER WAS APPOINTED IN GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE CALIFORNIANS IN THIS ROLE. I BEGAN MY CAREER STAFFCOUNSEL FOR THE COMMISSION ON STATE MANDATES. WANTED TO USE MY LEGAL TRAINING TO SERVE OTHERS. AND OVER THE PAST TWENTY THREE YEARS. I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO JUST THAT. FIRST IN PUBLIC SERVICE. BEFORE VENTURING OUT INTO THE PRIVATE SECTOR. I'M PROUD OF THE COUNTRY CONTRIBUTIONS I MADE IN THOSE SMALL MOMENTS. IN THIS APPOINTMENT IS BROUGHT MY CAREER FULL CIRCLE. TO ONCE AGAIN BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. TO MAKE A POSITIVE IMPACT IN OTHERS LIVES WORK WITH AN AMAZING GROUP OF DEDICATED INDIVIDUALS HERE AT CST AS WELL AS WITHIN OUR NETWORK OF NONPROFIT AND PUBLIC SECTOR SUB GRANTEES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THROUGH THIS AMAZING GROUP. BOTH WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND OUR NETWORK. I'M EXCITED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE MY EXPERTISE EXPERIENCE AND ENERGY THOSE CALIFORNIA'S THE DEPARTMENT SERVES. THANK YOU I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS THIS AFTERNOON. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- IF OKAY- SENATOR COME UNDER I MAY START WITH YOU GIVEN THAT I NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU MIGHT HAVE TO EXIT- SO GO READY THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEN BECAUSE I TO NEVER KNOW WHEN I MAY BE EXITING. EVEN IF I AM STILL HERE. I IT IS A PLEASURE TO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS- DIRECTOR SCRIBNER AND- APOLOGIES THAT WE WERE NOT ABLE TO FIT SOME TIME AND- IN TWO. MARK OUR CALENDARS TO MEET PRIOR. TO TODAY I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I THINK THAT- THE WORK THAT COMES OUT OF- CST IS. INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT I MEAN MY GOODNESS HOW WE CAN WORK AS A STATE TO ALLEVIATE ELIMINATE POVERTY I THINK THAT SHOULD BE TASK NUMBER ONE FOR ALL OF US- AND SO THE PROGRAMS. THAT YOU ADMINISTER ARE INCREDIBLY. RIGHTEOUS I HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS ONE IS AROUND- THE COW EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT CAL EITC- I KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN LOTS OF DISCUSSIONS AROUND HOW TO EXPAND THE USE OF THE I. T. C. AND I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS ON WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN DO IT. I'M AND- WE'VE ALSO LEARNED THAT THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES WITH CAL HE ITC'S COMPATIBILITY WITH ITS FEDERAL COUNTERPART. SO A WHAT ARE SOME pTHINGS THAT CAN BE DONE TO ELIMINATE- THE AREAS OF INCOMPATIBILITY SO THAT WE CAN DO MORE TO GET WHAT IS DUE TO- THE- WORKING POOR AND POOR CALIFORNIANS AS POSSIBLE AND THEN B. HOW CAN WE WORK TO EXPAND ITS USE SO IT CAN DO MORE GOOD. I REALLY APPRECIATE ARE THE QUESTION I TELL YOU WHAT YOU SEE I AGREE WITH YOU IT IS ONE OF OUR SHE- ADDED POVERTY PROGRAMS HERE IN THE STATE- AND THANK YOU FOR PRO TAB BACK IN THE DAY FOR STARTING OUT OF THE- STATE'S FIRST OUT YEAH IDC. GRANT PROGRAMS. NO I THINK THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE WERE RESTARTED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN TO UNDERSTAND WHERE WE ARE NOW- AFTER LAST ROUND OF NUMBERS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TWENTY FIFTEEN WE SAW ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND GRANTS- SEAT TALLY I TO SEE- GRANTS GO OUT FOR ROUGHLY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AND THROUGH THE COOPERATION COME COOPERATION BETWEEN CST THE FEDERAL THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AS WELL AS OUR REGIONAL PARTNERS WE'RE WORKING RIGHT NOW UNITED WAYS OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO I THINK THAT THE WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR CURRENT NUMBERS. WE GO FROM THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND THE FOUR POINT TWO MILLION. AND OVER EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANTS ARE BEING EXPANDED SO I THINK THAT THERE'S BEEN A REAL STRONG STEADY GROWTH OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS. THIS YEAR'S YEARS BEEN ADMINISTERING CAL YET YOU SEE WHAT I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH YOU THAT WOULD THERE'S ALWAYS THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO BETTER AND TO GET. THE AWARENESS OUT AND I THINK THAT. THAT'S THE BIGGEST STRUGGLE THAT WE'RE HAVING AND WE DON'T WNT TO LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THERE ARE CALIFORNIANS OUT THERE. THAT DO NOT FILE TAXES. BUT COULD BENEFIT FROM THE DOLLARS AND SHOULD BENEFIT. SO I THINK THAT THROUGH OUR REGION OUR REGIONAL PARTNERS- THAT WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO WORK ON MAKING AN AWARENESS AND- OUTREACH. ONE OF THE PRIMARY GOALS EACH AND EVERY YEAR NOT JUST THE FREE TAX PREP NOT JUST LETTING PEOPLE KNOW THAT THERE'S DALY THE CHILD CREDIT AS WELL NOT JUST DOING THE I. TEN PORTION OF IT. THAT'S ALL GREAT OF YOU KNOW ASPECTS OF CALLIE IDC. BUT IF WE'RE NOT GETTING THE PEOPLE THAT NEED IT. FILING AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THESE THESE AMAZING CREDIT- YOU KNOW WE ARE NOT DOING ALL THAT WE CAN AND IT IS I THINK AN ONGOING OPPORTUNITY TO BE BETTER. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS TO REALLY WORK ON THAT OUTRAGE TO CONTINUE TO SEE THESE NUMBERS GROW. FROM THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE THOUSAND THE TWENTY FIFTEEN TO FOUR POINT TWO MILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE I THINK IS SHOWS. THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAKING THIS PROGRAM. AS WELL KNOWN AND AS EXPOSURE RICH AS POSSIBLE AND WILL CONTINUE TO FIND WAYS. TO OPEN THOSE DOORS TO THOSE CALIFORNIANS THAT ABSOLUTELY CAN AND WOULD BENEFIT FROM THESE DOLLARS. BUT MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT IT OR MAY NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY- TO GET FILING AND RECEIVED THE DELEGATION TO SEE GRANT. I AGREE WHOLEHEARTEDLY- I THINK THERE'S SO MUCH MORE THAT CAN BE DONE AND POSSIBILITIES AND THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE IMMENSE. YOU KNOW I KNOW MY BUDGET SUB FOR COMMITTEE WE DID HAVE A HEARING ON THIS AND I THERE ARE PARTNERS ACROSS THE STATE THAT ARE. I THINK WORKING OF THEIR SELVES OFF- TO. GET THIS INFORMATION OUT TO THE COMMUNITIES AND IT'S- THEY WITH THERE'S STILL MORE THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE SO I WOULD JUST I THINK THAT THERE ARE WE SHOULD NOT JUST BE LEANING ON THOSE PARTNERS IN MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE DOING MORE OUTREACH BECAUSE- FROM MY WHAT I WAS ABLE TO READ AND ASCERTAIN THEY ARE DOING QUITE A BIT- THERE. ARE HARD TO REACH FAMILIES. THAT ARE NOT GETTING THE INFORMATION OR DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE SHARING INFORMATION THAT'S NEEDED OR DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT- AND SO ARE THERE YOU TALK ABOUT PARTNERS ONE OF OUR BIGGEST PARTNERS AS A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE THERE WAYS THAT WE CAN LEAN ON THEM. I THINK THE- YOU KNOW I THINK INITIALLY WELL THE DEPARTMENT WOULD LIKE TO DO AGAIN IS EXPAND OUT REALLY AREN'T OUR OWN NETWORK OUTREACH THROUGH BOTH OUR C. S. B. G. SUB GRANTEES AS WELL AS OUR LIFE HE GRANT- IT CERVANTES BECAUSE THEY ARE REALLY THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND IN THE COMMUNITIES KNOWING FROM THE BOTTOM UP WHAT THESE COMMUNITIES NEED. AND IN DOING THAT ONGOING OUTREACH AND REALLY TRYING TO REACH LIKE YOU SAID IT YOU KNOW I THINK THE THING IS THAT THERE IS A LARGE PART OF THESE ARE THE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES THAT COULD BENEFIT FROM. THIS PROGRAM. I'M JUST QUITE FRANKLY AFRAID TO PUT THAT TRUST AND FAITH. IN THE GOVERNMENT TO YOU KNOW. BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES FOR THEM AND I THINK I THINK IT'S JUST IT IS A STRUGGLE. BUT WHEN WE- WHEN WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH- THE CBO SAID THAT THE- THAT SOME OF OUR PARTNERS THAT IN THE MIGRANT SEASONAL FARM WORKER- ROUND WHICH IS B. G. WITH- LIKE. PRETTY WELL YOU KNOW THESE AGENCIES THAT REALLY ARE IN PART OF THOSE OMMUNITIES WHERE THE STRUGGLE IS VERY REAL. TO GET THEM TO COME OUT THE TRUST THAT THESE SERVICES- THEY CAN AVAIL THEMSELVES- TO. I REALLY THINK THAT DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD WE CAN WE CAN ABSOLUTELY LEVERAGE- AND PROVIDE THOSE LINKAGES THAT ARE OUR CURRENT NETWORK COUNTS. IN THAT THEY DO ON THE DAILY. A THANK YOU FOR THAT I WAS TAKEN OUT- I'M- ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT YOU HAVE- AND THIS IS MY LAST QUESTION- MANY OF THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU ADMINISTER- YOU KNOW HAVE VERY SIMILAR PROGRAM OBJECTIVES. AND SO JUST WONDERING YOUR THOUGHTS ON YOU KNOW WAYS THAT WE CAN MAXIMIZE BENEFITS TO ALL CALIFORNIANS WHILE MINIMIZING DUPLICATION OF EFFORT- BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE CARES ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING WHAT WE NEED OUT TO CALIFORNIANS IN A WAY THAT ISN'T DUPLICATIVE- OR OVER BURDENSOME TO BUREAUCRACY DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS. YEAH ABSOLUTELY I THINK THAT'S A GREAT POINT TO MAKE AND- I WOULD SAY THAT ON THE SRFACE A LOT OF IT COULD APPEAR THAT THE KIND OF SHARE THE SAME SPACE. BUT WHEN WE DIG A LITTLE DEEPER INTO THESE POGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE THE COMMUNITY SERVICES BLOCK GRANT IS AN AMAZING FUNDING SOURCE THAT CAN'T PROVIDE LINKAGES LINKAGES ON LEVERAGING. ACROSS VARIOUS DIFFERENT AREAS I'M NOT JUST SERVICES BUT ALSO OUTCOMES YOU KNOW TALKING ABOUT PROVIDING FUNDING FOR FOOD BANKS BUT THEN ALSO. ON THE JOB TRAINING OR RESIDENCY TRAINING WHERE SOMEONE MIGHT WRITE AN AMAZING RESUME AND GET A JOB AND HAVE THIS AMAZING OUTCOME. OF FROM THAT LINKAGE THAT C. S. B. G. IS BRING IN FOR. OUR LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM LIE HE FOR EXAMPLE YES IT HAS THE WEATHER IS ATION SIDE OF THE HOUSE AND WE DO HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY WHETHER THEY SHOULD DISTANCE PROGRAM AS WELL. AND THIS YEAR WE ARE FORTUNATE TO BE IN RECEIVING OF A LOT OF MONEY UNDER THE DEAL WE PROGRAM FOR WEATHER IS ASIAN. BUT THEY HAVE A BOWLS AND WE'VE BEEN FORTUNATE TO WORK WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS. TO BOTH A LOT THE DEPARTMENT OR THE WEATHER SYSTEMS PROGRAM WITH THE LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM SO THAT THERE ARE. IS THE LEVER. THE GREAT WORK. HOLISTIC STOP THE WORD BUT- MORE COME- OF YOU KNOW- OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA I CAN AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THESE PROGRAM BUT NOT ONLY ARE PROBE. THE INCOME PROGRAM THAT IS STATE FUNDED BY CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS AGAIN THAT HAS A VERY SPECIFIC PURPOSE BUT WE BOTH WE HAVE HOLDEN ON MULTI FAMILY AS WELL AS MIGRANT SEASONAL FARMWORKERS SO WHILE THERE IS WEATHER IS ATION THEIR SOLAR PEAVEY HAPPENING UNDER THE LAW THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM OF THE STATE CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS. THERE ARE FOCUSED SPECIFICALLY TO HELP A PARTICULAR SET OF CALIFORNIANS- THAT DESPERATELY NEED THIS WORK AND I THINK FINALLY IT REALLY THAT KIND OF BRINGS IT ALL TOGETHER IS THE CALIFORNIA REPAIR PROGRAM WHERE THE DEPARTMENT WAS ABLE TO GET A BILLION DOLLARS OUT THE DOOR IN JUST OVER SIX MONTHS WITH NO AUGMENTATION TO STAFF I DO KNOW I'M HAPPY TO SEE SB STEP ON THE BACK. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING I AM STILL IN SHOCK THAT WE WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE- IT BUT THAT PROGRAM EIGHT AS WELL HELP YOU TO REARED WHAT CALIFORNIANS NEED IN THIS SPACE NOT ONLY JUST A UTILITY SUPPORT. BUT ALSO WHETHER IS ASIAN BUT I THINK YOU CAN SEE WANTS TO KIND OF DIVE INTO THESE PROGRAMS. THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY VERY AWARE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR DUPLICATION. AND WE HELP AND DESIGNED OUR STATE PROGRAMS OR WORK WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS. TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE THESE. SEPARATIONS THAT WHEN WE LINK THEM TOGETHER CREATES A WHOLE LOT MORE COMPLETE- APPLICATION OF THE SERVICES AND DOLLARS. THANK YOU FOR THAT- I CAN I CAN SEE YOUR PASSION FOR THIS WORK- RADIATING THROUGH THE TV SCREEN. SO WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU SO MUCH OF MEADOW VICE CHAIR WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO NEXT THANK YOU. WELL THANK YOU ARE DIRECTORS. SCRIBNER FOR STEPPING UP AND OBVIOUSLY ARE YOUR BACKGROUND SUGGESTS THAT YOU ARE VERY ARE WELL EQUIPPED TO TAKE ON THIS NEW RESPONSIBILITY SO CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT ON. MY THE GOVERNOR I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ON KNOWING THAT. THE BULLS OF THE COMMUNITY SERVICES- IN DEVELOPMENT- IS TO REDUCE POVERTY SO ONE OF MY QUESTIONS IS. YOU ARE THE PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO HELP PEOPLE ACHIEVE SELF SUFFICIENCY HAVING WON THE TOP HONOR TIME BEEN A SOCIAL WORKER THAT WAS ALWAYS MY GOAL IN WITH MY CASELOAD BUT- DO YOU HAVE- IN ACCOUNTABILITY DASHBOARD OF ANY SORT TO WHERE YOU. ARE CAN MEASURE WHETHER THE PROGRAMS ARE HELPING INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES ACHIEVE SELF SUFFICIENCY. AND IF NOT. HOW WOULD YOU GO IN THAT DIRECTION SO THAT THE MANY THAT IS THERE FOR YOU ALL FOR THOSE SPECIFIC PURPOSE. WE HAVE A MEASURE OF BEST PRACTICES AND GIVE YOU ACTUALLY THE DATA. SAID HE A DIP ACTION IF THAT WOULD BE NEEDED. WELL ABSOLUTELY THAT DOVETAILS REALLY INTO- YOU KNOW THE THREE MAIN GOALS THAT I REALLY WANT TO ACHIEVE HERE WITH THE DEPARTMENT WHEN ALL THREE. CENTER AROUND. THE DEPARTMENT AND AS NETWORK. BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE FOR THOSE CALIFORNIANS THEY NEED IT. AND IT REALLY IS TO TAKE A LOOK AT. OUR DATA WHAT WE HAVE HOW CAN WE GET TO IT AND I THINK THAT- WE ARE IN THE CURRENT PLANNING STAGES OF OPERATING AND MOVING OFF OF OLD LEGACY SYSTEMS AND TO MORE ROBUST CURRENT SYSTEMS. SO THAT WE REALLY CAN USE DATA TO DRIVE OUR DECISION MAKING. I THINK THE SECOND POINT OF THAT I THINK IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS UNDERSTANDING THE DATA WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE PEOPLE AND SO I'D LIKE TO GET A BASELINE OF WHERE WE STAND WITH FIRST CITY. AND IN. EQUITY AND- IN IT'S JUST IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND IF WE ARE. GOING TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES FROM THE DEPARTMENT LEVEL THAT WE'RE DOING SO WITH COMPASSION AND EMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING. THE DIVERSITY WITHIN THE- THEY IN. THAT ARE THERE IN A JUSTICE IS THAT MAYBE THERE AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE AS THE DEPARTMENT THAT WE MODEL THE WAY. AND THAT WE CAN HELP OUR AGENCIES. UNDERSTAND THE VALUES THAT THE DEPARTMENT AND THE STATE TAKES WITH THOSE- PARTICULAR INITIATIVES. BUT THEN WE ALSO WANT TO A BASELINE OF WHERE OUR AGENCIES- I KNOW THAT MANY OF THEM HAVE SPENT MANY MANY YEARS- ON. D. E. I. KNOW JAKE WE CALL IT CHEN I HEAR THE STATE THEY DO D. E. I. J. LOCAL LEVEL I LIKE THE JET I WON YOU KNOW JUST LISTEN YOU KNOW EQUITY. DIVERSITY INCLUSION BUT- I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME THAT HAVE REALLY REALLY ROBUST PROGRAMS IN PLACE AND I WANT TO FIND A WAY. TO DO THE EASY THING LET'S JUST REPLICATE WHAT WORKS LET'S FIND THE HOLES THAT WE HAVE FILL THEM AND TAKE THE STEPS FORWARD. AND THEN FINALLY WHAT I'D LIKE US TO DO IS CONTINUE TO THE COLLABORATION WITH OUR NETWORK WE NEED TO HAVE OPEN HONEST EASY COMMUNICATIONS AND BY DOING THOSE THREE THINGS. I THINK THAT WHAT WE WILL ACHIEVE. IS A BETTER SENSE OF. WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THE DOLLARS OF THE LOCAL LEVEL. WHAT AND WHO IS BENEFITING FROM THE- HOW WE CAN POTENTIALLY BE BETTER AND WE ALWAYS CAN EVERY SINGLE YEAR THERE'S ALWAYS OPPORTUNITIES TO BE BETTER. AND THEN USE THOSE DECISION A DATA POINTS THE FOCUS ON THE PERSON. AND THEN THAT WAY WE ARE MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE DOING THE ABSOLUTE BEST WE CAN WITH THE DOLLARS AT HAND. BUT IT IS A PROCESSAND RIGHT NOW TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION QUITE BLUNTLY WE HAVEA LOT OF DATA. AND WE ARE STRUGGLING TO PASS YOU KNOW AND- GET THE BEST USED OUT OF IT AND THAT IS AND IT'S NOT GOING STRUGGLING AND WE WILL BE BETTER WITH IT AND I THINK EVERY SINGLE YEAR WE DO PROVIDE BETTER DATA POINTS FOR BOTH. THE PARTNERS SO THAT THEY HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH THOSE DOLLARS. AT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY LEVEL. WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT RESPONSE AND NOW YOU HIT ON A NUMBER OF THE THINGS THAT WOULD BE FOLLOW UP THOUGHT TO MY QUESTION SO I WON'T GO THERE. I JUST WANT TO APPLAUD YOU FOR THE PASSION THAT YOU DO SHOW UP FOR YOUR ASSIGNMENT- THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT JOB. VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE WITH OUR LOW INCOME PEOPLE WHO DO STRUGGLE TO MEET THE BASIC GONNA NEED THE LIGHT. ON THIS THE PART. ARE IS VERY MUCH- OUT SAY A COMMON DENOMINATOR AND HELPING THEM DO THAT SO. IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL I BELIEVETO US POLICYMAKERS IF THERE IS. SOME SORT OF A- AN ACCOUNTABILITY DASHBOARD SO THAT IF THERE'S LEGISLATION THAT'S NEEDED TO ADVANCE THE GOALS OF OUR THE AGENCY THEN IT WE ARE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. RIGHT IN LINE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND ENSURE THAT WE DO MEET THAT VERY NOBLE GOAL- CERTAINLY. DELIV PEOPLE AT. LEAST SO THAT THEY CAN ACHIEVE SELF SUFFICIENCY AND CERTAINLY ENJOY- THE GOLDEN STATE. SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOU TODAY AND LOOK FORWARD TO SOME INTERACTION OB OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS TO SEE HOW YOU'RE ACHIEVING THOSE GOALS AND- ARE GETTING US WHERE WE ALL WANT TO BE SO THANK YOU. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR DEDICATION TO THIS PUBLIC SERVICE VERY VERY IMPORTANT ONE. THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR I WILL- GO TO SENATOR LAYERED NEXT AND A KNOWLEDGE THAT SENATOR GROWTH HAS MADE IT OVER FROM THE HEALTH COMMITTEE FOR A BIT BUT- CENTER LAYERED ALL LET HER GET HER. SEA LEGS AND YOU GO AHEAD OVER HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN. OUR THIS IS ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE THE PREVIOUS TWO- COMMITTEE MEMBERS ASKED MOST OF THE THINGS I WAS GOING TO. LET ME THANK YOU FOR MEETING WITH ME THIS MORNING AND- LET ME ASK ONE QUESTION. ARE THAT I THINK THE U. PARTIALLY ADDRESSED WITH SENATOR COM WALKER BUT MAYBE I'LL ASK IT A DIFFERENT WAY AND THAT THAT. ARM TO RECEIVE MORE THAN A- DOLLARS OF FUNDING IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR AS A SIGNIFICANT ONE TIME AUGMENTATION- WHAT DID YOU FOR THE CHALLENGES DID YOU FACE IN GETTING IT OUT THE DOOR. AND- WHAT YOU LEARN AND IT HAS IT ACCOMPLISHED WHAT YOU'D HOPED IT WOULD IN ONE OF WAS ALLOCATED IN YOU ARE PUSHING IT OUT THE DOOR AND THANK YOU FOR. ITS KNOWLEDGE AND YOU KNOW THIS SMALL DEPARTMENT OF RECEIVING A B. YEAH IT'S- QUITE A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEN IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS. YEAH I LOOK AT IT NOW AND I THINK THAT WAS EASY FOR ME TO DO THAT EVERY YEAR BUT- IT. IS CHILDREN'S OF COURSE WE WERE ABLE TO NOT ONLY SPIN UP A BRAND NEW PROGRAM DEVELOP POLICIES- THE LEGISLATURE WAS WAS GRACIA. HELLO US TO. DO A- APPROACH THAN HAVING TO DO READ. WE WOULD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO MEET OUR TIMELINES OF WE HAD TO GO THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS. AND I THINK THAT WAS A THAT WAS A GREAT. OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO BE NIMBLE CREATIVE THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX. AND I THINK THE OTHER. WE UNDERSTAND OF ALL NEW ID PROGRAM. WE HAD TO STAND UP NEW ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS YOU KNOW IT WAS IT WAS QUITE A LIST FOR SURE- BUT I THINK THAT BY MARCH. WELL I DON'T THINK I KNOW HE DID IT WITHOUT ADDING A SINGLE PERSON TO THE DEPARTMENT. WE CAME IN UNDER THE TIMELINE WE HAD MINISTER EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR THAT WE COULD ADMINISTER. AND THOSE DOLLARS WHEN OUT THERE ARE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS TO THE TWO NINE HUNDRED NINETY THREE MILLION DOLLARS. TO PAY DOWN UTILITY AVERAGES. ON THE SHELVES I THINK. MORE THAN ANYTHING WAS. JUST ANNOUNCED THAT. THE IS THAT I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH I WORK WAS SUCH AN AMAZING GROUP OF ALL STARS YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT HOW. WE'RE THE SMALL BUT MIGHTY- DEPARTMENT BUT EVERYONE OF A ROCK STARS YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT PULLING ANYBODY OUT OF. OF A SMALL CLUB THERE ALREADY WHERE YOU KNOW AND SO I THINK THE- MR CASE. THAT WORK IN THIS PART BECAUSE OF OUR SIZE YOUR CLOSE. TO SEE THE IMPACTS OF THE DECISIONS AND THAT THE POLICIES AND THE THINGS THAT WE DO IN OUR NETWORK DOES EVERY SINGLE DAY. I THINK IT GIVES A REALLY A CLEAR LENS AND AN IMPETUS. TO MAYBE GO A LITTLE BIT FURTHER A LITTLE BIT HARDER AND I KNOW. MY ENTIRE TEAM DID THAT FOR SIX MONTHS. NOW I DON'T THINK THAT OBVIOUSLY WE CAN DO THAT EVERY YEAR WE TRY OF COURSE- BUT I THINK THE BEARS ARE THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE- SENATOR WAS JUST REALLY NOT HAVING TIME IF WE IF WE COULD- WE WILL RESPOND UP LITTLE SMALL DIVISION AND ADDED A FEW PEOPLE AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE RICHER. BUT WE HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY LET ME. LET ME ASK A FOLLOW UP HOW WOULD YOU MEASURE. WHAT THE OUTCOMES WERE FROM THE OUT THE DOOR. ARE YOU TALK ABOUT THE PROCESS OF GETTING. HOW WOULD YOU ACTUALLY MEASURE COMES ARE CURRENTLY BEING MEASURED BUT THE OUTCOME IS DIRECTLY SERVICING ONE POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS RECEIVING A CAPS LOCK YOUR CALIFORNIA RICH PAYMENT PLAN PROGRAM BENEFIT ON THEIR UTILITY BILL WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF THE OF THE MONEY BEING DISTRIBUTED TO THEIR PARTICULAR UTILITY. AGAIN NINE HUNDRED NINETY THREE MILLION DOLLARS WERE APPLIED TO- UTILITY AVERAGES AND SO CURRENT. WE ARE GOING THREE OH WHAT IS BEEN DEEMED THE CLOSE OUT PROCESS BUT WE ARE PERFORMING AUDITS OF UTILITIES WE ARE- MAKING SURE THAT THROUGH THAT ON A PROCESS THAT PAYMENTS ARE MADE AS THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE. AND WE WILL BE GETTING REPORTING BACK FROM YOU USUALLY OF WHEN THEY WERE PAID HOW THAT MONEY WENT WHO IT WENT TO. WE DON'T KNOW WHO IT A IT'S A NON OPTIMIZED BY ACCOUNTS. BUT THEN WE WILL BE ABLE TO AGGREGATE THAT DATA AND- PROVIDE THE FIFTY DATA POINTS THAT'S IN THE GOVERNMENT. I REPORT TO PRESENTABLE. SHOW YOU EXACTLY. WHAT WE CREATED HOW WE DID IT WHEN IT HAPPENS AND IN THE END RESULT BUT I THINK THE END RESULT OF RIGHT NOW IS WHAT WE ABSOLUTELY NO ONE POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE BENEFITED TO THE TUNE OF NINE HUNDRED NINETY THREE MILLION DOLLARS AND PAY DOWN THEIR UTILITY REGION'S. THANKS VERY MUCH REALLY APPRECIATE- AGAIN YOUR MEETING AND- RESPONSIVENESS TO THE QUESTIONS I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING. THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERED- SENATOR GROWTH THANK YOU MADAM FOR TEN. AM THANK YOU MISTER SCRIBNER FOR BEING- HERE TODAY AND- I TO LOOK FORWARD TO VOTING FOR YOUR APPOINTMENT I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS THOUGH I DID LIKE ALL THE INFORMATION THAT YOU SUBMITTED TO THE RULES PACKET AND- I DO ESPECIALLY LIKE THE COMMENTS THAT YOU MADE A JUST A MINUTE AGO WHEN YOU WERE TALKING AND YOU TALKED ABOUT ROCKSTAR TEAMS AND YOU TALKED ABOUT. EVEN IN THE MIDST OF IMPLEMENTING A NEW I. T. PROGRAM LIFTING UP- YOU KNOW IN A NEW BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET THAT HAD TO BE DISTRIBUTED OUT. IN THE ROOM TO DO THAT WITH WE SAID NINE HUNDRED NINETY THREE MILLION DOLLARS WENT OUT DIRECTLY TO THE CALIFORNIANS THAT DESPERATELY NEED IT. AND YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW YOU DID THAT WITHOUT ADDING A SINGLE. M. PERSON. ADD TO THE TEAM IN YOUR TEAM DID IT FOR SIX MONTHS. AT TO ME THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY AND I APPRECIATE YOU CLAIMING YOUR TEAM BUT- I DO BELIEVE AS WELL IT COMES AND WITH. THE DEMONSTRATION OF GREAT LEADERSHIP SO THANK YOU FOR. AND THE LEADERSHIP YOU PROVIDE TO THIS DEPARTMENT. I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS- AND I APOLOGIZE IF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY ASKED THESE QUESTIONS I WAS IN HEALTH COMMITTEE SO I DO APOLOGIZE. IF THIS IS DUPLICATED. M. HOW IS THE COMMUNITY SERVICE BLOCK GRANT CHANGED IF AT ALL OVER THE COURSE OF YOUR TENURE IN THE DEPARTMENT AND DO YOU HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO IMPROVE THE STATE'S ADMINISTRATION OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING SOURCE AND IF SO. CAN YOU SHARE THAT INFORMATION. YEAH ABSOLUTELY UNFORTUNATELY THAT WASN'T A DUPLICATE. I WELCOME THE QUESTION. I YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THAT THERE ARE YOU KNOW THAT THE TEACHERS BLOCK GRANT AGAIN IS SUCH AN AMAZING FUNDING SOURCE AND IT'S AN AMAZING WAY TO GET THE DOLLARS OUT THE DOOR BECAUSE IT'S- INVERTED. IT'S A BOTTOM UP APPROACH TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THOSE IN NEED IN THE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. IT IS BASED ON COMMUNITY. THE NEEDS ASSESSMENTS THAT ARE SUBMITTED BY OUR SUB GRANTEES TO THE DEPARTMENT. AND THEY ARE THE ONES. OF THROUGH THAT NEEDS ASSESSMENT THROUGH THEIR THEIR COMMUNICATION PLANS THEY EVERY YEAR IDENTIFIED THEIR GOALS. WE% WANT TO ACHIEVE ACTS WE WANT TO ACHIEVE WHY WANNA CHOOSY AND THEN AT THE END OF THE YEAR. WE SEE HOW WE DID. AND SO I THINK THAT IT'S THE GREAT SUCCESS. OF COMMUNITY ACTION IT'S THE GREAT SUCCESS OF OUR PUBLIC PARTNERS AS WELL. I THINK IT'S WHITE COMMUNITY THE COMMUNITY SERVICES BLOCK GRANT HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE HONESTLY I WOULDN'T CHANGE MUCH IF ANYTHING THAT I WOULD DO BETTER AS A DEPARTMENT. IS TO HELP SUPPORT OUR NETWORK THROUGH BETTER DATA GATHERING AND BETTER DATA SHARING AND WE ARE WORKING ON THAT BECAUSE WE CAN BE BETTER AT THAT. BUT AGAIN AS A SOURCE. BEING ABLE TO LEVERAGE AND WRAPAROUND SERVICES IN ANY WAY NECESSARY. DEPENDING ON THE LOCATION IS REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY THAT I WOULDN'T TOUCH AND I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO. WE JUST NEED TO MAKE SUREAS A DEPARTMENT WE ARE UP APPROPRIATELY ACCURATELY. AND YOU KNOW PASSIONATELY THE REALLY. WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH WEATHER NETWORK SUPPORTING THEM AND GIVING THEM THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL. THANK YOU AND YOU ANSWERED MY SECOND QUESTION BECAUSE I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT HOW YOU SERVICE A DIFFERENT AREAS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE ENTIRE STATE IS DIFFERENT FROM ONE AREA TO THE OTHER IN AND YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT DATA DRIVEN. AND DECISIONS ON HOW TO IMPLEMENT THAT IN YOUR RESPONSE SO THANK YOU SIR VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THIS DEPARTMENT. THANK YOU I CENTER GROVE I THINK. A LOT OF GOOD QUESTIONS. HAVE BEEN ASKED ABOUT MY COLLEAGUES. I'M INTERESTED- YET IN THE WORK WITH YOUR COMMUNITY PARTNER AGENCIES- IN. YOUR ONGOING RELATIONSHIP. HOW DO YOU WORK WITH THEM IT'S TO THE POINT THAT CENTER GROVE MADE UP AND DOWN THE STATE DIFFERENT AREAS DIFFERENT ISSUES. SO THROUGH THE PANDEMIC THROUGH A FIRE SITUATION. A FIRE RELATED NEEDS. HOW DO YOU FIND WAYS TO WORK DIFFERENTLY WITH THOSE PARTNERS ANY EXAMPLES OR THINGS YOU WANT TO SHARE WHERE YOU'RE ABLE TO. BE FLUID FLEXIBLE AND- MOVE DIFFERENTLY IN THIS AREA VERSES THAT AREA BECAUSE I THINKING GOVERNMENT. I'M IN THOSE PARTNERSHIPS MATTER. BUT THE OVERSIGHT OF HOW YOU DO THAT GIVE ME ANY EXPERIENCES YOU. THINK YOU MIGHT WANT TO STOP. AND IT AND- WITH US TO HELP US TO SEE HOW THOSE PARTNERS WORK. YEAH THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A PARTNER BASED. APPROACH TO HELPING ALLEVIATE POVERTY- AND LIFT UP LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS HERE IN THE STATE. I THINK FIRST AND FOREMOST THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT. ALL OF THESE FEDERAL GRANTS ARE BASED ON LOCAL CONTROL. IT IS IT IS OUR LOCAL PARTNERS THAT WE ABSOLUTELY DEPEND ON. TO DO OUTREACH TO DO THEIR COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENTS TO NARROW BY BOOTS ON THE GROUND. WHAT THEY'RE- NEIGHBORS NEED. AND SO THAT THEY CAN ANNUALLY WITHIN G. S. B. G. NOT SO MUCH WITH OUR ALONG COME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. BUT THEY CAN ADJUST- AS THEY THEY SEE- THOSE THINGS CHANGE AND THE WAY THAT WE I THINK ARE. ABLE TO BE CREATIVE AND FLEXIBLE AT THE DEPARTMENT LEVEL IS WITH C. S. B. G. WE HAVE- IN ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT MEETS REGULARLY. AT ADDRESSES POLICY AND PROGRAMMATIC CONCERNS AND SO WE STATE TIED INTO- REALLY KIND OF THE HIGH LEVEL OF THINGS THAT THE DEPARTMENTS WORKING ON SOME OF THE NETWORK INOTES. AND ON THE ENERGY SIDE THOUGH THE LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM SIDE WE HAVE AN ENERGY CAL'S THE SAME TYPE OF SET UP WHERE WE HAVE OUR LOCAL PARTNERS AND WE HAVE THESE DIALOGUES ON ON THE REGULAR AND WHEN WE HAVE. A NEW PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE LIKE THE IT'S GOT ANOTHER LOW INCOME HOME WATER SYSTEMS PROGRAM THE NEW WATER FEDERAL WATER PROGRAM YEAH. WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE BEST WAY THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF THIS NEW PROGRAM. AND NOT HAVE TO REINVENT THE WHEEL. SINCE IT WAS A ONE TIME FUNDING SOURCE OF THE HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS SO I THINK HAVING THAT OPEN COMMUNICATION AND WORKING COLLABORATIVELY. IS REALLY. IS REALLY JUST THE CASE FOR US. THANK YOU YOU KNOW I ONE MORE QUESTION YOU TALKED ABOUT FIVE DATA COLLECTION AND- I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT THE NUMBER OF LIVES THAT YOU POTENTIALLY TOUCHING CALIFORNIA. THROUGH YOUR PARTNERSHIPS. AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE THAT YOU KNOW FROM IN PARTICULAR I THINK ABOUT THINGS LIKE- EMERGENCY NEEDS NOT NECESSARY. SARALEE THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION BUT BUT YEAH I. T. C. A U. WE UTILITIES WATER ENERGY. YOU KNOW I SORT OF WONDERED THERE'S A FRIGHTENING PIECE OF THIS WHICH IS THE GOVERNMENT KNOWS WHO YOU ARE BUT IT BUT IN TERMS OF KNOWING WHERE THERE ARE POTENTIALLY NEEDY CONSTITUENTS AND RESIDENTS IN CALIFORNIA THAT NEED HELP- IF THERE WERE A SITUATION WHERE WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE DO OUTREACH TO LET PEOPLE KNOW. THAT THEIR RESOURCES FOR THIS CRITICAL NEED- THAT CRITICAL NEED WOULD YOUR DEPARTMENT BE ABLE TO DO THAT. YES I BELIEVE SO AGAIN I WOULD THINK IT WOULD REALLY DEPEND ON WHAT THE PROGRAMMATIC SHAPE OF THE DOLLARS LOOKS LIKE PARTNERS DO THAT ALL THE TIME AND I THINK THAT AGAIN. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE NEEDS FAR OUTPACES THE DOLLARS THAT WE ADMINISTER EVERY YEAR AND THAT'S UNFORTUNATE BUT THIS IS NOT AN ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM NONE OF OUR PROGRAMS ARE. THEY ARE FIRST COME SERVE APPROACH BUT I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT OUR COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCIES WITH C. S. B. G. R. ENERGY GROUPS LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM ON THE ENERGY SIDE. ARE REALLY DIALED INTO THEIR COMMUNITIES THEY KNOW WHAT THE NEEDS ARE THEY KNOW WHERE. SERVICES COULD BE EXPANDED AND MOVED INTO- DIFFERENT AREAS DIFFERENT ROUNDS AND I THINK EVEN THE DEPARTMENT. WERE VERY GOOD WITH PICKING PARTNERS OF WE NEED TO DO A REGIONAL APPROACH- TO- IN MISTER PROGRAM WE DID THAT WITH OUR LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM THE CAP AND TRADE FUNDED- GROUND THAT. RESULT IN THE BACK WAS HERALDED AS A GREAT MODEL A STATE AND NATIONWIDE ON ADMINISTERING A DOLLARS IN THAT PARTICULAR WAY WE WORK WITH REGIONAL PARTNERS WHO ARE ABLE TO IDENTIFY NEEDS AND START AT. YOU KNOW TAKING A BITE OUT OF THE POVERTY PROBLEM IN TAKING A BITE OUT OF. OF THE STRESS AND ANXIETY THAT THAT LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS ARE THOSE ARE JUST STRUGGLING EVEN AFTER THE PANDEMIC MAY BE FEELING- AND LETTING THEM KNOW THAT THERE ARE SERVICES AVAILABLE.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE RULES COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY. I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT FOR THE PAST THIRTY YEARS I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO WORK IN DIFFERENT SECTORS OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMMUNITY THAT I BELIEVE IS ALTOGETHER PREPARED ME TO LEAD CALAFATE. SO I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO THE GOVERNOR FOR THIS APPOINTMENT. EARLY IN MY CAREER I WORKED FOR AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER AND IN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. BEFORE JOINING THE WHAT BANKING WORLD WHERE I GAINED EXPERTISE IN FINANCING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND- COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND THEN I USE THAT TO EXECUTE MISSION AND PROFIT DRIVEN TRANSACTION. WHILE THERE I ALSO SPENT TIME SERVING ON BOARDS AND VARIOUS ADVISORY COMMITTEES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS. AND THIS ALLOWED ME TO SORT OF PEEK INTO THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND WORK AND LEARN SOME OF THE BEST MODELS OF BALANCING MISSION PROFITABILITY. MY MOST FORMATIVE AND RELEVANT EXPERIENCE WITH THE LAST SEVEN YEARS WHICH LED UP TO THIS APPOINTMENT. WHERE I. SIMULTANEOUSLY SERVED ON CALLAGY BASED BOARD OF DIRECTORS WHILE TAKING ON THE ROLE OF CREATING DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING A NATIONAL FINANCING PLATFORM FOR CEDIA FIVE AMONG OTHER THINGS. MY WORK SB EVA AND CALAFATE WAS FOCUSED ON THE INTERSECTIONS OF FINANCING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. AND PAR FOR THE COURSE THAT MEANT WE NEEDED TO HAVE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE WE NEED TO BE PRAGMATIC WE NEED TO HAVE A VISION AND WE NEED TO MOVE QUICKLY. WHICH IS EXACTLY WHERE I FEET CALAVERAS CONTRIBUTION WITHIN THE BROADER HOUSING ECO SYSTEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AT ITS CORE CALAFATE ISN'T ORGANIZATION THAT THRIVES ON LEVERAGING PARTNERSHIPS. WE WILL NEED TO LEAN IN IN ORDER TO SUCCESSFULLY SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHED NEW PROGRAMS. BUT ALSO STAY ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF NEW PRODUCT DELIVERY TOOLS FOR NEW AND EXISTING HOMEOWNERS. AS WELL AS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOUSING. AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR I INTEND TO IDENTIFY WHAT I CALL THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHITE SPACE. THAT IS THE PLACES WHERE WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SOME IMPROVEMENTS BUT WE HAVEN'T YET FOUND SOLUTION. SO WE WILL BE EXPANDING THE AGENCY'S FOCUS ON DELIVERING FINANCING SOLUTIONS IN AN EQUITABLE WAY WITH A FRESH SET OF EYES TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY THROUGHOUT THE AGENCY. AND I TOLD MY TEAM. IF WE THINK IT'S HARD DON'T BE AFRAID TO GO THERE. BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND FIRSTHAND THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT WE DO AND HOW IT CAN CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY OF THE POOR AND WORKING. AND UNDERSERVED AND NEGLECTED COMMUNITIES. HARD IS WHAT THEY HAVE TO IN TO WORK EVERY DAY. I KNOW A LITTLE SOMETHING ABOUT THAT LIFE BECAUSE I WAS THAT TWENTY SOMETHING SINGLE MOM WITH TWO KIDS WHO FOUND SAFETY AND SECURITY IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. I WAS ALSO THE FIRST TIME HOME BUYER WHO USED HOMEOWNERSHIP PROGRAMS THE PURCHASE MY FIRST HOME WHICH ULTIMATELY LED TO A PROSPEROUS LIFE FOR MY KIDS. AND WEALTH CREATION THAT WILL NOW BE ABLE TO BE PASSED ON TO MY GRANDKIDS DRIVE ME BUT IT CENTERS ME. AND IT GIVES ME THE INSIDER KNOWLEDGE THAT MANY IN SIMILAR POSITIONS JUST ON HALF. I INTEND TO USE THAT EXPERIENCE LEGALITY OF FAITH WE CONTINUE TO HELP CALIFORNIANS FIND SAFE DIGNIFIED AND STABLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SOLUTIONS. IN LATITUDE JOB CALAFATE HAS AN AMAZING FRAMEWORK TO HELP THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS OUT THERE WITH SIMILAR STORIES JUST LIKE MINE. AND NOW IT'S MY TIME. SO I ALONG WITH THE REST OF MY TEAM WILL BE INVESTING IN DIVERSE COMMUNITIES THE FINANCING PROGRAMS THAT HELP MORE CALIFORNIANS. A PLACE TO CALL HOME. I WANT CLOSE JUST BY THINKING THAT STAFF THAT WONDERFUL STAFF THAT HELPED ME TO PREPARE FOR THE DAY. ALSO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. SECRETARY LOTUS CASTRO IN B. C. EIGHTEEN AND A THREE PM OTHER PARTNERS. FOUNDED IN THEIR HEARTS TO MAKE THIS ROLE IN EASE ME INTO MY FIRST EIGHT MONTHS. ALSO WANT TO THANK ITS KNOWLEDGE THOSE FOLKS IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING INDUSTRY WILL PERSONALLY REACHED OUT TO ME TO CHEER ME ON. AND OF COURSE I WANT TO THANK MY FAMILY. MY FRIENDS WHO HAVE SUPPORTED ME AONG THE WAY THAT INCLUDES MY HUSBAND MARIO HOLE. MY CHILDREN ROSS. HEART IN KAELIN WILSON AND THEIR PERSPECTIVE PARDON SHE NAY AND DOMINATE. WE'RE ON THE PHONE TODAY LISTENING. THANKYOU. FOR EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO. AND NOW I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT MANY MEMBERS WE HAVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH I APPRECIATE THOSE OPENING COMMENTS- VERY MUCH. US SENATOR GROWTH IS GOING TO GO FIRST AND-HE MAY HAVE TO RUN BACK OUT TO HEALTH GO RIGHT AHEAD THANK YOU MADAM FOR TIM. AND THANK YOU MISTER JOHNSON HOW FOR YOUR OPENING STATEMENT YOUR HEART IN YOUR PASSION FOR- THE AMERICAN DREAM HOME WHEN I'M HOME OWNERSHIP IN A PLACE TO LIVE ARE TRULY EVIDENT IN NOT ONLY THE JOB. THAT YOU HAVE HAD JOBS THAT YOU HAVE HAD IN THE PAST IN AND WHERE YOU WILL GO AFTER THIS CONFIRMATION SO THANK YOU. I DO APOLOGIZE AGAIN I HAVE TO BOUNCE BACK TO HAVE ANOTHER COMMITTEE SO I APPRECIATE THE PRO TEN LETTING ME GO FIRST I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. AND A FEW JUST TO A WHAT'S CAL HATER IS IN V. BARRIERS TO HOUSING CONSTRUCTION IN SPRING AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS IN CALIFORNIA. AND THERE'S SEVERAL. PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT IF PASSED THE YEARS SEEK WERE- YOU KNOW YOU HAVE SOME AREAS WHERE YOU REALLY NEED TO BUILD IN THEM. YOU KNOW IT'S POLICY AREAS IN YOU MIGHT HAVE NIMBYISM. LOCAL ORDINANCES THINGS LIKE THAT IT. WOULD CAN YOU IDENTIFY THOSE BARRIERS AND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO TO MAKE SURE THOSE BARRIERS. OF LIMITED OR DON'T EXIST SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING. ES THANK YOU. I THINK THE LARGEST BARRIER THAT WE HAVE TO TACKLE IS THE OVERALL PROBLEM WITH HOUSING SUPPLY- AND THIS IS GOING TO REQUIRE A MULTIFACETED APPROACH ALL ALL OF THE HOUSING AGENCIES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO COME TOGETHER TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FOCUS ON THE LAND USE AND REGULATORY REFORMS AND SEEK WAYS TO STREAMLINE PRODUCTION AND PROVIDE DEVELOPMENT IMPACT PERHAPS THE MOST. WHICH I BELIEVE IS PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE. WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE THAT. SOME OF YOU ALL HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN RECENT LEGISLATIVE MEASURES SUCH AS S. NINE ESCAPED. SB THREE THIRTY. WHICH I BELIEVE WILL BE CRITICAL TO THIS EFFORT. AND I ALSO WANT TO COMMEND THE WORK THAT OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EACH CD HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN. IN DOING SORT OF FURTHERING THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- AS WELL AS INCREASE LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND PROVIDING REGULATORY CERTAINTY IN THE MARKET WHICH I THINK WILL BE KEY TO BUT TO FURTHERING OF PRODUCTION EFFORTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT AND I APPRECIATE THAT COMMENT BECAUSE I DID HAVE THREE QUESTIONS THAT I HAD ELIMINATED ONE BECAUSE I DO NEED TO GO BACK AND THAT WAS ABOUT YOUR COLLABORATION WITH OTHER AGENCIES A TOP OF. YOU KNOW THE TOP. KEY FOR AGENCIES THAT YOU WOULD WORK WITHIN COLLABORATION SO I APPRECIATE THAT YOU ARE. A LEADER THAT IS GOING TO COLLABORATE WITH THOSE ADDRESS OTHER AGENCIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE HOUSING WHAT'S YOUR ESTIMATION OF THE HOUSING THAT IS NEEDED- TO BE PRODUCED IN CALIFORNIA IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS. A LOT OF THAT WORK IS BEING DONE BY OUR PARTNERS IN FACT WITH EIGHT CD AND WHAT THEY'RE ESTIMATING TODAY IS THAT WE NEED ABOUT TWO. POINT FIVE MILLION HOUSING UNITS IN ORDER TO MEET THE CURRENT NEEDS. THAT'S SIGNIFICANT- BECAUSE A MILLION OF THOSE ARE VULNERABLE POPULATION. SO COLLABORATION IS GOING TO BE ONE WAY THAT WE CAN TACKLE THIS ISSUE BEST. WE'VE BEEN WORKING FOR MANY YEARS WITH THE FOR HOUSING AGENCIES ONE EXAMPLE OF ONE JUST SIMPLE THING THAT WE DID- WITH THE BOND PROCESS WAS WORK WITH THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE TO DESIGN AN APPLICATION THAT STREAMLINES AND AVOIDS DUPLICATION OF EFFORT. THAT MAKES THE PROCESS OVERALL MORE COST EFFICIENT. AND COST EFFECTIVE SO I THINK US COLLABORATING IN FIGURE OUT WAYS TO AVOID DUPLICATIVE EFFORTS AND EFFICIENCIES FOR THE BORROWERS WILL BE CONTENT WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE WAY THAT WE MAKE STRIDES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU MA'AM THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WITH YOUR BANKING HISTORY YOUR LOAN HISTORY YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE FINANCE INDUSTRY AND ALSO YOUR PASSION FOR- AND HEART TO MAKE SURE THE AMERICAN DREAM COMES TRUE IN IN HOMEOWNERSHIP OR HOUSING. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO VOTING FOR YOUR YOUR CONFIRMATION. THANK YOU A CENTER GROVE CENTER COME LONGER WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO NEXT. SURE THANK YOU. I AM. HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH MR JOHNSON HALL EARLIER TODAY M. AND X. M. AND EXCITED TO SEE YOU AGAIN- I YOU KNOW I'M GONNA JUST. NOT I DON'T KNOW THAT EVERYONE WILL GET THIS BUT I AM FEELING A BIT CHARITABLE TODAY WITH MS JOHNSON HALL BECAUSE SHE OUT NOT ONLY GRADUATED FROM AN H. B. C. U. BUT SHE IS ALSO A MEMBER OF THE DIVINE NINE SO THEY'RE NINE AFRICAN AMERICAN SORORITIES. AND FRATERNITIES OF COURSE SHE'S NOT IN MINE I WHICH IS WHY I AM FEELING TERRIBLE ENOUGH TO GIVE HER A SHOUT OUT- FOR BEING IN ONE OF THE OTHERS- BUT ULTIMATELY AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY'RE ALL IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY FOCUS ON SERVICE. AND MS JOHNSON HOW YOU SEEM TO BE COMMITTED ADD TO THAT AS WELL. I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I ARE YOU KNOW WAS JAZZED LISTENING TO ALL OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT- ARE COMING OUT OF THE DEPARTMENT. AND WOULD LOVE TO KNOW SOME IDEAS THAT YOU HAVE ABOUT MORE CREATIVE WAYS. THAT- CAL HFA. CAN SUPPORT THE INCREASE OF ACCESSIBLE- AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUPPLY YOU TALKED ABOUT. WHAT'S NEEDED ARE YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF REGULATION IN TERMS OF INCREASED COLLABORATION IN TERMS OF STREAMLINING PRODUCTION ARE THERE OTHER SORT OF YOU KNOW OUT OF THE BOX. INNOVATIONS THAT ARE MAY BE HAPPENING IN OTHER STATES HERE BECAUSE WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE- CITIES WHERE THE COST OF LIVING IS INCREDIBLY HIGH AND THE SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS INCREDIBLY LOW- AND SO THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING IT'S IMPORTANT TO DOUBLE DOWN ON THOSE BUT I TINK WE'RE ALWAYS EXCITED TO HEAR ABOUT NEW INNOVATIONS. AND POSSIBILITIES- THAT WE COULD ALSO IMPLEMENT. TO HELP US ATTACKERS SUPPLY ISSUED A SUPPLY PROBLEM. THANK YOU SENATOR KAMLAGER I WOULD SAY THAT THE OUR ANSWER TO THE SUPPLY ISSUE IS A PROGRAM THAT WE LAUNCHED BACK IN DECEMBER AND IT IS THE ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES GRANTS OF UP TO FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO EXISTING HOMEOWNERS WHO FILLED AN EIGHTY YEAR ON THEIR PROPERTY. THE GRANT CAN BE USED FOR PRE DEVELOPMENT COSTS PLANS AND SO FORTH. AND WE OF ALLOCATED ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO GET THIS PROGRAM OFF THE GROUND. IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS GONE OVER THE PAST YEAR YOU'LL NOTE THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT THERE'S BEEN A GROWTH IN INTEREST IN THIS AND I'M HOPING THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE PRODUCTS THAT WILL BE ABLE TO. LEVERAGE IN A VERY LARGE WAY OVER THE COMING YEARS. I ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT ONE PROGRAM THAT I AM PARTICULARLY EXCITED ABOUT IT'S CALLED THE FORGIVABLE EQUITY BUILDER PROGRAM. WITH THIS PROGRAM WE'RE WE WILL BE PROVIDING UP 210% OF THE PURCHASE PRICE- AS A DP A LOAN. FOR THAT BECOMES FORGIVABLE AFTER FIVE YEARS THIS IS A PROGRAM FOR FOLKS THAT ARE AT ABOUT THIS PROGRAM IS THAT IT ALSO TOUCHES SOME OF THE INEQUITIES THAT. AND THEN ALSO BUT ALSO HELPS WITH INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH FOR FOLKS THAT HAVE BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY AS WELL AS LEGALLY- DISENFRANCHISED BY OUR HOUSING MARKET. SO THIS IS ONE THAT I CALLED THE GAME CHANGER. AND I HOPE THAT FOLKS WILL GET EXCITED ABOUT THIS IN SHARE IN THE M. MESSAGING AROUND THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO DO SO MUCH THE TURN AROUND SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE HAD IN CALIFORNIA. NOW MS JOHNSON HOW I TOLD YOU THAT I DIDN'T WANT YOU TALKING ABOUT THAT IN THE HEARING BECAUSE I WANTED TO TRY TO GET ALL OF THAT MONEY IN MY DISTRICT. I'M SORRY YOUR MY GOODNESS MY GOODNESS I'M- SAY THAT- THE MIX INCOME PROGRAM IS OVERSUBSCRIBED- AT EACH APPLICATION CYCLES SO THAT ALSO SUGGESTS THAT WE SHOULD BE TRYING TO FIND MORE OPPORTUNITIES- TO FUND THAT BECAUSE IT IT THAT SEEMS TO BE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL YES. YES THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT AND WE ACTUALLY ACTUALLY HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE CALL IN AN ALTERNATIVE TO THAT. YOU'RE RIGHT THE BOND PROGRAM IS REALLY QUITE OVERSUBSCRIBED BUT WE INTRODUCED LAST YEAR A RECYCLED BOND PROGRAM. IT'S A LITTLE COMPLICATED BUT EFFECTIVELY WHAT IT DOES IS IT ALLOWS THE TRANSFER OF TAX EXEMPT BONDS OF THE TAX EXEMPT BOND AUTHORITY TO OTHER PROJECTS. SO THE IMPORTANT PART ABOUT THIS THE POOR NOTE ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM IS THAT IT DOES NOT GO AFTER EXISTING BOND ALLOCATION OR TAX CREDITS IT'S A IT'S KIND OF A GO AROUND. AND SO THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE ACTUALLY SIGNED AN MOU WITH THE SAN DIEGO AS WELL AS OAKLAND. AND SO FAR AND WE THINK THAT BY AT THE END OF THE DAY WILL BE ABLE TO PRODUCE SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THREE THOUSAND UNITS OUTSIDE OUR ALREADY OVERTAXED SYSTEM. SO WE HAVE A PLAN TO GET THIS OUT TO AS MANY CITIES THAT CAN WHO HAVE EXISTING. FOR ISSUERS OF BONDS AND HAVE EXISTING PORTFOLIOS WHERE WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND- SOME TRANSACTIONS. TO FACILITATE THIS PROGRAM. GREAT THANK YOU FOR THAT NOW ARE YOU GOING TO ARE ALL THESE EIGHT K. IS GOING TO CALL IN AND SUPPORT. OINTMENT. OF SENATOR I HOPE SO BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU. I HAVE A AWFUL LOT OF THAT IS IN MY FAMILY. WELL THEY'RE ALL MY ON. SO THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT UPSET WITH ME WHEN I WENT BACK IN THAT DIRECTION. I DO HOPE THAT MY SORORITY SISTERS WILL CALL INTO SUPPORT THANK YOU WELL I THEY SHOULD- AND IT ALSO THAT RESPONSE LETS ME KNOW HOW YOU HAVE DONE YOUR THOROUGH HOMEWORK SO. THANK YOU FOR THAT- I LOOK FORWARD TO. BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT YOUR CONFIRMATION AND AS WE DISCUSSED I LOOK FORWARD TO BEING ABLE TO PARTNER WITH YOUR AGENCY I THINK THIS WORK IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND THE INFORMATION- THAT IS AVAILABLE THROUGH YOU ALL AND THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU ARE OFF. PROBABLY MORE CRITICAL- THAN EVER BEFORE AND SO YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT THAT WE WILL BE PARTNERING ON SOME WAYS TO OUT REACH TO- COMMUNITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS IN MY DISTRICT TO GET THIS INFORMATION OUT SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SERVICE. THANK YOU SENATOR COM LONGER- SENATOR MADAM VICE CHAIR WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO NEXT. LET JOHN GO JOHN JOHN IS HAVING TO ASK QUESTIONS WANT TO. GOOD THANK YOU THAT THEY KEEP ME THEY KEEP ME ON YOUR TEST CALL JOHN JOHNSON HALL THEY KEEP ME ON MY TOES MA'AM I SURE GO RIGHT AHEAD THANK YOU SO MUCH AND THANK YOU- THIS IS JOHNSON HALL DIRECTOR OF I WAS ALREADY PLANNING ON VOTING FOR YOU JUST READING THE BACKGROUND REMEMBERING OUR INTERACTION WHEN YOU'RE APPOINTED TO THE BOARD AS A BOARD MEMBER I BELIEVE IN TWENTY TWENTY BUT CHAO YEAR INTRODUCTORY STATEMENTS TODAY JUST SEAL THE DEAL- YOUR YOUR DISCUSSION ABOUT SOME OF THE INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH IN THE ABILITY TO. YOU KNOW- GROW THAT WITHIN OUR FAMILIES IS SO VERY IMPORTANT CERTAINLY IS THE BACKGROUND FOR MY FAMILY WHERE MY POOR MOM HAD TO LEAVE SCHOOL WHEN SHE WAS MERELY FOURTEEN BECAUSE THEY WERE STARVING IN THOSE DAYS SO- BUT THE ABILITY. TO ACQUIRE PROPERTY AND- THE OUT YOU KNOW PASS THAT THE IT WAS CERTAINLY AWARE THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR WAY BACK. SO THAT SIDE CRITICAL AYE- MENTIONED ONLY AND IN TERMS OF DISAPPOINTMENT WITH THE MEASURE THAT WAS ON THE BALLOT THAT WILL PROBABLY ENTER PARA. INTERCEPTOR IMPACT ON THEIR ABILITY GOING FORWARD AND I'M I'M SURE YOU'RE GOING TO FOCUS SOME OF YOUR EFFORTS ON BALLOT. IN THE IN THE COMING YEARS I DO HAVE ONE QUICK QUESTION. REGARDING THE MIXED INCOME PROGRAM FINANCE PROJECTS ARE THAT SEEM TO BE ABLE TO REACH CONSTRUCTION QUICKER. AND FOR LESS THAN OTHER COMPARABLE DEVELOPMENTS THAT WAS IN THE BACKGROUND INFORMATION- IS THAT ACCURATE AND- IF SO- WHAT MIGHT BE OF THE REASONS FOR THAT AND SOMETHING MAYBE WE NEED TO BUILD ON. THANK YOU SENATOR- THAT IS ACCURATE- EVEN TODAY- THAT PROGRAM WAS VERY SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR COST EFFICIENCY AND FOR THE ABILITY TO BRING TRANSACTION TO FRUITION. AND THE OTHER QUICK REMOTE MORE AND IN A IN A IN A FAST WAY- WHAT WE HAVE NOTICED BECAUSE OF THE SUPPLY ISSUES IS THAT IT'S A LITTLE BIT SLOWER BUT STILL. QUICKER THAN WHAT YOU WOULD GENERALLY SEE WITH THE TWO OTHER- FINANCING CHANNELS- AND SO I BELIEVE THAT EVEN TODAY- THE PROGRAM WHAT WE WILL SEE. IS THAT THOSE PROGRAMS WILL BE COMING TO FRUITION IN JUST A FEW YEARS WILL HAVE THOSE PROJECTS ACTUALLY ALBUM AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC SO THAT THEY COULD MOVE IN. I THINK WHAT HAS MADE IT MEMORABLE AND IS ACTUALLY THE TERMS OF THE OF THE PROGRAM ITSELF- AND THE FACT THAT WITH THE PROGRAM WE ARE PROVIDED FINANCING WE ARE ALSO. PROVIDED WITH BONDS AND JUST THOSE TWO SOURCES ARE OFTEN JUST OF SUFFICIENT ENOUGH TO MOVE THE PROCESS THROUGH QUICKLY. OFTENTIMES AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR REQUIRES UP MULTIPLE CAPITAL SEOUL SOURCES SOMETIMES FIVE FIVE SIX SEVEN SOURCES AND SO THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY OUR PROGRAM MOVES. HIM TO MOVE QUICKER. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND CERTAINLY YOU HAVE MY ON. MY VOTE FOR YOUR CONFIRMATION AND- I DO THAT AS HIGH FIVE TO YOU AND YOUR PASSION FOR THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT ROLE THAT YOU HAVE TAKEN ON SO THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO BEING ABLE TO VOTE FOR YOU FOR THE CONFIRMATION. THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR SENATOR LAYERED ANNOUNCER JUST FOLLOWING ALONG EVERYBODY ELSE ALTHOUGH I CLEARLY DO NOT HAVE A SORORITY CONNECTION- THE YOU WERE VERY ELOQUENT IT IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT THEN IF YOU BRING UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS WHETHER WONDERING WHETHER IT'S WORTH HOUSING AGENCIES OR WHETHER IT'S WITH GOVERNMENT AGENCIES THEN YOU WERE REALLY ELOQUENT ABOUT YOUR OWN STORY. I THINK THE YOU KNOW ONE OF THE TWO QUESTIONS I HAVE IS YOU ARE HEADING AN AGENCY THAT HAS PROGRAMS THAT ARE PRESCRIBED THEY REALLY THEY HAVE RULES THERE ARE CERTAIN WAYS YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO IMPLEMENT THEM OR ACT ON THEM HOW DO YOU TAKE THE COMMITMENT THAT YOU DEMONSTRATED IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT AND YOUR EXPERIENCE. MAKE PROGRAMS MIGHT BE VERY PRESCRIBED WORK IN THE WAY THAT YOUR VALUES TELL YOU THEY SHOULD WORK- VERY GOOD QUESTION SENATOR THANK YOU FOR IT. I THINK THE WAY THAT I LOOK AT THIS IS THAT OUR PRODUCTS NEED TO BE AS DIVERSE AS OUR HOUSING. AND SO ONE WAY TO TACKLE THAT IS TO COME UP WITH DIFFERENT PRODUCTS. ON TO ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I TALK ABOUT THAT WHITE SPACE IN AND LOOKING AT WAYS THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY BE A LITTLE BIT MORE INNOVATIVE IN THE WAY THAT WE HAVE WORKED GOING FORWARD. SO I THINK THE WAY THAT YOU ANSWER THAT QUESTION IS THAT THE WAY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION BEST IN A WAY TO WORK WITHIN THOSE. PRESCRIBED BEST IS TO COME UP WITH AS MANY PRODUCTS AS WE CAN DELIVER WITH THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE. THE THAT'S PART OF MY PLAN. I'VE GOT- SEVERAL SEVERAL THINGS IN MY BACK POCKET THAT I HAVE FOOLED. FROM MY BANKING EXPERIENCE AND ALSO MINDS EXPERIENCE NOT ONLY WORKING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT WORKING NATIONALLY. AND SO THAT'S- THAT'S THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE THE DIFFERENCE. IN IS COMING UP WITH AS MANY PRODUCTS AS BEFORE. MAN IN THAT PROCESS IF. YOU FIGURE OUT THAT THERE'S SOME WAYS THAT THE PROGRAMS COULD BE STRUCTURED SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY. IS THAT SOMETHING WHERE WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM YOU WHERE ARE WILL CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION AND IF YOU THINK THERE'S SOMETHING THAT COULD BE DONE. THAT BETTER MEETS THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE. ELIGIBLE FOR YOUR PRODUCTS THAT YOU WILL. COMMUNICATE WITH US. ABSOLUTELY WE WILL COMMUNICATE WITH YOU. I WILL SAY THIS AS WELL SENATOR. THAT WHILE YOU'RE RIGHT THAT A LOT OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE PRESCRIBED NOT JUST AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE ARE SEEING WE'RE STARTING TO SEE FOLKS LISTEN A LOT MORE- THEY WANT THESE PROGRAMS TO WORK AS- BEST AS THEY CAN. AND SO WE HAVE NOT BEEN SHY ABOUT USING OUR NETWORK TO CHALLENGE THOSE PRESCRIPTIONS. AND WELL YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S GOING TO BE UP TO THEM TO HELP WITH THAT. BUT THEY OPEN ABOUT TAKING A LOOK AT THINGS BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE ALL INTERESTED AT THIS POINT IN. HELPING PEOPLE GET HEALTH AS A PRIORITY. SO THERE'S FLEXIBILITY IN THE MARKET. NOT A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY BUT AT LEAST FOLKS ARE REALLY WILLING. TO RETHINK IT AND ASK THEMSELVES IF ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. YOU KNOW. SO IF THOSE PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE LEGISLATURE LIKE YOURSELF THEN YOU ALL HELPING US TO MAKE. THAT CASE AND TELL THAT STORY THAT I THINK IS GOING TO HELP GOING FORWARD. OKAY WELL I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. RESPONSE AND I HOPE WE DO IT AND HE HAD A SMILE ON HOPE AND MY SPOUSE WAS NOT WATCHING BECAUSE WE'RE ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF THE WAY THROUGH THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN EIGHTY YOU. THE LAST THING I WOULD HAVE NEEDED IS FOR HIM TO THINK WE COULD APPLY FOR ANYTHING. BUT THE- BUT I'VE LEARNED A LOT FROM THAT HE SAID THAT I HOPE REFLECTS INTO THE SYSTEM. AND I JUST HOPE WE WOULD CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE I THINK. THAT THE WORLD IS CHANGING AND SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THE LEVEL OF AFFORDABILITY. OF THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS PEOPLE IN THE WAY THAT SOME NEEDS COME OUT OF THAT ARE THINK WE'D REALLY LIKE TO. WORK TOGETHER BECAUSE YOU CITED THE AUTHOR OF ONE OF THE TWO BILLS YOU SITE I SITTING TO THE SIDE HERE. AND WE ARE WORKING HARD TO RESPOND SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO SERVE AND BRING SUCH GREAT EXPERIENCE AND BRING THE PASSION I LOOK FORWARD TO. SUPPORTING YOU WHEN WE GET TO A VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERED AND- I AT THAT BIRD THAT BRINGS IT TO ME AND I COULDN'T BE MORE THRILLED ABOUT THIS CONFIRMATION OF THIS APPOINTMENT- EKING ALONG THE SAME LINES AS A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES AND FOR SENATOR LAYERED TO RECOGNIZE YOUR RESUME. AND THE DIVERSITY OF THAT RESUME THAT HELPS TO BE PREPARED TO LOOK AT HOW WE PROVIDE HOUSING IN THE STATE- IT YOU KNOW IT YOU'RE YOU'RE THE PERFECT PERSON TO DO THIS JOB. ARIENS TO YOUR PROFESSIONAL WORK LIFE AND FROM THE REPUTATION THAT YOU HAVE IN THE STATE. WHICH IS WHAT LED TO ADD TO IT AS THE VICE CHAIR SAID TO I THINK THE GOVERNOR APPOINTING YOU TO THE BOARD. AND THEN RECOGNIZING THAT YOU WOULD BE THE PERFECT PERSON TO LEAD THIS AGENCY- THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS ISSUES IN OUR STATE IN TERMS OF OUR ECONOMIC VIABILITY IN TERMS OF- THE STABILITY OF FAMILIES AND- I THINK. WE HAVE COME UP WITH SOME INTERESTING AND CREATIVE TOOLS. OF A FINANCING IS SO COMPLICATED FOR DEVELOPMENTS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SO. YOU KNOW THAT INTIMATELY AND I THINK USING YOUR STAFF AND YOUR BOARD. AS INCREDIBLE RESOURCES TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER. I APPRECIATE I DID WANT TO ASK A QUESTION AND CENTER LAYERED I HOPE MY SPOUSE ISN'T LISTENING EITHER BECAUSE SHE'S. SHE IS GETTING READY TO AND TO UNDERTAKEN A D. U. AS WELL HAHA I SAY SHE BECAUSE SHE WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO HAVE ANY INPUT INTO THIS PROCESS. SHE SHE WILL ACT LIKE SHE WILL LET ME AND THEN IT WILL TURN OUT THAT. IF I GET TO PICK OUT THE DOOR KNOB I'LL BE LUCKY- AND THAT'S ALL GOOD FRANKLY I'LL BE CLEAR. BUT ON THE A. D. U. R. PEAS I'M INTERESTED TO HEAR HOW YOU THINK IT'S GOING THROUGHOUT THE STATE BECAUSE- I LOVE THE IDEA OF THAT IS A PRODUCT FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO CREATE- THE ABILITY TO OWN A HOME THEMSELVES TO USE AN ID YOU EITHER FOR FAMILY. OR OR AS A MEANS TO PAY THE MORTGAGE FOR OWNING A HOME ALL OF THOSE THINGS MAKE THIS A WONDERFUL. OPPORTUNITY HOW ARE YOU SEE IN THIS UNVEILED THROUGHOUT THE STATE DO YOU HAVE. ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH US ABOUT. CERTAIN AREAS ARE THEY DOING IT BETTER THAN OTHER AREAS HAVE YOU ENCOUNTERED RESISTANCE FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. I KNOW SOME OF THEM BRACED IT OTHERS MAY BE A LITTLE BIT SLOWER- AND IT JUST JUST KIND OF A LITTLE MORE IN DEPTH ABOUT ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN RELATED TO THIS PROGRAM AND OUR SUPPORT FOR THE GRANTS FOR THOSE WHO. NEED THEM TO MAKE THE A. D. USE A REALITY THE KEY COMPONENTS OF OUR PROGRAM IS OUR LINDER NETWORK IN THAT'S ALSO THE KEY COMPONENT OF BUILDING AN EIGHTEEN YEAR WITH WELL- AND SO ONE OF THE- CHALLENGES THAT WE DO SEE IS THAT ARE THE LENDER NETWORK IN THE FOLKS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED AB YOU DEVELOPMENT. IS NOT AS ROBUST AS WE HAD INITIALLY THOUGHT- THERE ARE CITIES THAT I BELIEVE THAT ARE MORE ROBUST THAN OTHERS IN IN TERMS OF FINDING. A PARTNER AND A CONSTRUCTION LENDER PARTNER TO WORK WITH SACRAMENTO HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF THEM. THEY'VE GOT SOME GREAT PARTNERS THERE BUT WE'RE WORKING VERY HARD TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF LENDERS WHO ARE AVAILABLE TO HELP SUPPORT THIS BUSINESS AS A PRIORITY. OF COURSE WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT DEVELOPING- WOULD DEVELOPING PARTNERSHIPS WITH NONTRADITIONAL PARTNERSHIPS WITH CDFI ORGANIZATION. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BOOTS ON THE GROUND THEY'VE BEEN ON THE GROUND FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND SO WE ARE EXTENDING THE TYPES OF LENDERS THAT WE ARE DOING WORK WITH SO THAT WOULD INCLUDE CDFI. CREDIT UNIONS AND THINGS LIKE THAT- TEND TO BE ABLE TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE NIMBLE IN THE FACE- I THINK WE ARE SEEING SOME ROBUST ACTIVITIES IN CERTAIN CITIES I MENTIONED SACRAMENTO WE ARE ALSO SEEING IN SAN JOSE. ANOTHER AREA ON AND SO WE THINK IN PART OF THE REASON WHY WE INCREASED OUR AMOUNTS TO FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IS THAT WE THINK THAT- WITH OUR ADDITIONAL OUTREACH RELATIVE TO MARKETING WHETHER THAT BE ONLINE AND SO FORTH BOB WILL BE SOME WAYS TO PICK UP ON THIS ACTIVITY IN A BIG WAY. BUT IT WILL BE CHALLENGING- PEOPLE STILL ARE A LITTLE BIT I THINK IN GENERAL FOLKS ARE A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THE OVERALL COST OF REAL. WHICH CAN BE OF CONSIDERABLE. AND FOR SOME FOLKS WHO WERE THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IT MIGHT EVEN BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE AND DIFFICULT GIVEN THE OVERALL COST METRIC FOR THIS. SO WE'RE ALSO REACHING OUT TO- PARTNERS CITIES WHO ARE OF THOSE INCLUDE THE CITY OF PASADENA AS AN EXAMPLE AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO LEVERAGE OUR DOLLARS WITH THEIR DOLLARS TO HOPEFULLY MAKE THIS A MORE PALATABLE- PROPOSITION FOR THEM ESPECIALLY THOSE ON THE FAR STUFF WELL THANK YOU AND I HOPE- TO THE COMMON AND ANOTHER OF MY COLLEAGUES MADE IF YOU HAVE IDEAS THAT. YOU THINK ARE WORTHY OF CONSIDERATION THAT WOULD REQUIRE- OUT LEGISLATION THAT YOU WOULD LET US KNOW THERE'S NO LACK OF I THINK LEGISLATORS WHO WANT TO BE HELPFUL IN THIS ARENA SO. THANK YOU FOR THAT WITH THAT- I THINK WE CAN MOVE TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT- WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO THIS CONFIRMATION. I WILL START RIGHT HERE IN ROOM TWENTY TWO HUNDRED AND SEE. IF THERE'S ANYONE FROM THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT PLEASE COME ON FORWARD ON. TO THE PODIUM HERE AND THE- STATE YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION IF ANY AND COMMENTS.

WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M GOING TO ASK MY COLLEAGUES AS YOU OF MAKE COMMENTS OR OR AT PARTICULARLY ASK QUESTIONS IF YOU WILL DIRECT YOUR QUESTION TO ONE OF THE- PALM FOR PLEASE SPECIFICALLY IF YOU WANT ALL THREE. TO RESPOND TO A QUESTION LET ME KNOW WHEN AND WILL GO IN ORDER AND SENATOR LAYERED LET ME IN FAIRNESS. YOU WOULD LIKE TO START OF SUCH. AS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR IN. IT IS GREAT TO MEET CHIEF PAIN IN- I'VE KNOWN SUPERVISOR CHÁVEZ FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS IT'S GOOD TO SEE HER IN. A CHIEF MILLS WAS THE POLICE CHIEF OF MY HOMETOWN AND IT WAS A HUGE LOSS WHEN HE- MOVED AT THE END OF LAST YEAR. TO HIS NEW JOB AND GLAD TO SEE HIM AGAIN- I AM GOING TO ASK ONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS THAT'S GOING TO GO TO ALL THREE OKAY THEN I THINK IT'S REALLY. IT'S THE GENERAL CARESSED QUESTION THAT'S AT THE HEART OF YOUR WORK AND YOU KNOW ONE SPECIFIC SITUATION WE HAD WITH REGARD TO CORRECTIONS WAS WITH THE SAN DIEGO JAIL AND IT. LED TO. TWO SUCH- OUR REACTION THAT THERE WAS EVEN A STATE AUDIT DONE OF SUPPORT WHAT WAS SUPPORTED ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS BY LEGISLATORS- FROM HERE AND MY QUESTION IS IN YOUR ROLE AS A BOARD MEMBER HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE ACTUALLY FINDING OUT ABOUT ISSUES THAT ARE GOING ON AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND BEING ABLE TO ADDRESS THEM FROM YOUR A POSITION HOW DO YOU JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE STAYING ON TOP OF THESE. THE SUPERVISOR CHÁVEZ LET ME ASK YOU TO GO FIRST THEN WE'LL GO TO CHIEF PAINS AND THEN TO CHIEF MILLS. THANK YOU SENATOR LEARNED SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTION AND IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN ALSO. YOU KNOW I THINK- ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE CAN DO AS BOARD MEMBERS IS REALLY WORK WITH THE VERY TALENTED SMART STAFF WE HAVE AT ESCC- I THINK THAT'S ONE THING I THINK THE OTHER IS THAT WHEN WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES LOOK AT. AUDITS NEWSPAPER ARTICLES OTHER ISSUES THAT GET RAISED BY THE PUBLIC IN THE COMMUNITY IT'S REALLY TO LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO INVESTIGATE THOSE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE- I THINK THAT IN THE IN THE INSTANCE THAT YOU REYES WELL WHAT WAS MOST INTERESTING TO ME IS THAT. THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE. AND SO USING AN AUDIT TOOL OR OTHER KINDS OF COMMUNITY TOOLS LIKE THAT ARE WE ON EARTH CHALLENGES- AND THEN FRANKLY I THINK THE OTHER THING WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT A ONE OF THE TRENDS WE'RE SEEING ACROSS THE STATE. BECAUSE THOSE TRENDS THAT ALLOW US TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU. LOOK AT LEGISLATIVE HEARINGS WHEN THEY'RE NECESSARY THANK YOU AGAIN. FOR THE QUESTION WHY GREENWOOD STUFF BUDGET DAMAGE HE'S NOT LISTENING TO THE CONCERNS OF THE COMMUNITY FOR THE ABILITY FOR THE YES YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO NUMBER ONE UP TO BE ABLE TO ACT ON THOSE CONCERNS I THINK THERE ARE CRITICAL BUT THINK ONE THING THAT WE WANT TO ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT INDEFINITE BECAUSE HE IS- IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S AFFORDABLE THE THING THAT WE CAN DO FOR. THE SAUDIS THAT ENSURE THAT THE- INCARCERATED PERSONS ARE SAFE WHILE THEY ARE IN ANY OF OUR GOAL ARE YOU WILL STILL BE CELL NO I THINK- THERE HAVE TO BE MECHANISM THANKS FOR ALLOW THE PUBLIC IF THEY HAVE AT THE MOVIES- QUARTERSTAFF NINE ONE MAY HAVE INFORMATION FOR THEM TO HAVE THE ABILITY AND. THE PLACE ABLE TO SHARE DATA FROM WITH GET. ENOUGH FOR ME TO DRAW. THE PUBLIC. WELCOME BACK IN PUT BACK ON. FOR SO THAT- HE DIDN'T HAVE OF THE PEOPLE GOT IT. SAN DIEGO ONE ONE BUT YEAH TO REMEMBER MEETING WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE SOME GOOD DESPITE ABOUT WHAT WILL BE THE NEXT. ARE THE ORDER TO- FRIDAY THANK MORE INFORMATION. OUR VOTE THANK YOU BY DEFAULT SO THAT THAT WOULD GIVE PROVIDE. T. SAN DIEGO JEFF SENATOR LAYERED THING YOU FOR THE IN IT IS THE TO SEE YOU AS WELL- I THE RATE WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BEING A AWARE OF ALL THE ISSUE THAT ARE TAKE PLACE AS A SEVERAL FOR ONE WE NEED TO BE FULLY IMMERSED. IN THE PER PERSON I FULLY IMMERSED IN THE INFORMATION THAT IS COMING TO US FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES. PERSONAL CONTACTS ARE IMPORTANT. IN A RELATIONSHIP TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK DIRECTLY. WITH PEOPLE TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON. IN THESE LOCATIONS IS VITALLY IMPORTANT NOT ONLY AT THE- COUNTY JAIL LEVEL BUT ALSO IN THE PROBATION DEPARTMENTS. AROUND THE STATE THAT'S WHY IT'S CRITICAL TO HAVE PEOPLE LIKE- CHIEF AIDS. AIDS ON THE- BOARDS WHERE HE CAN REACH OUT AND TALK TO PEOPLE AND GET INFORMATION FAIRLY QUICKLY. THE SECOND IS WE HAVE TO TRUST OUR PROFESSIONAL STAFF AT THE BSE SIX. THEY ARE VERY BRIGHT CAPABLE THOUGHTFUL- INTELLIGENT PEOPLE WHO I'VE GOT TO HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT FOR. AND THEN LASTLY ARE TWO MORE THINGS ONE IS WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT DATA. STATEWIDE DATA TO FIND OUT- WHAT EXACTLY IS GOING ON WHAT IS THAT DATE I MEAN JUST OUTSIDE THE STANDARD DEVIATION OF WHAT IS TYPICAL FOR A- A FACILITY. I AM LOOKING AT FOR INSTANCE PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE. NOT TO REPORT OUT TO CC. END UP PUTTING PRESSURE ON THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR- COMING INTO COMPLIANCE. AND THEN THE LAST THING IS I REALLY. TRULY BELIEVE THAT SEEMS SO IMPORTANT ON THE FOR THE BSE SEAT OUT PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE LIKE WE DO. ON THE BOARD. BECAUSE THEY ARE ABLE TO GIVE US SOME INSIGHT INFORMATION THAT WE WOULD NOT. OTHERWISE HALF AND SO I THINK THAT ALL THOSE THINGS TOGETHER. WILL ALLOW US TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A VERY CUTE ACUTE AWARENESS OF WHAT'S TAKING PLACE. IN THE FACILITIES AROUND THE STATE. FOR YOU AND I APPRECIATE THE ANSWER OF ALL THREE OF YOU AND I KNOW ALSO THAT. OUR SUPERVISOR CHAVEZ SAID AT THE BEGINNING. THAT ARE PART OF THIS IS A LEARNING PROCESS WHERE YOU MIGHT REFLECT US THINGS THAT. ARE NECESSARY OR YOU'VE LEARNED OR WHAT THERE MIGHT BE FURTHER ACTION AND I WOULD INVITE ALL THREE OF YOU TO DO THAT. I THINK THE LAST THING I'D LIKE TO DO IS ASK A QUESTION. A DIRECTLY OF SUPERVISOR CHAVEZ AND THAT IS I JUST KNOW- I THINK NOT EVEN FROM TALKING TO YOU BUT FROM PRESS ACCOUNTS AND WATCHING. THE TO SANTA CLARA COUNTY JAIL HAS BEEN- AND ISSUE AND I KNOW THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HAS TAKEN AGGRESSIVE ACTION EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY IN CHARGE OF THE JAIL. TO DEAL WITH THIS WAS GOING TO ASK. BEFORE YOU DESCRIBE THAT SITUATION AND HOW IT IS IN FOUR THEM TO YOU FOR SERVING IN THIS POSITION. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER LAYERED FOR THE QUESTION- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE HAD HERE IS. A WELL WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF THEM BUT ONE REALLY STARTED WHEN WE HAD OF A MURDER IN OUR JAILS FIGHT TO. REXALL OFFICERS. AND AND THIS HAPPENED IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. OR YEP TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND FROM THAT POINT ON WE WORK VERY CLOSELY FRANKLY WITH THE SHERIFF AND ALL OF OUR PARTNERS TO DO YOU. HAVE THE FBI AND OTHERS COME IN AND INVESTIGATE TO REALLY HELP US UNDERSTAND. WHAT WASN'T WORKING IN OUR JAILS WHAT DO WE NEED TO IMPROVE AND HOW WE CAN IMPROVE IT. AND ONE OF THE THINGS I WOULD SAY THAT I THINK IT'S REALLY CRITICAL IS THAT. THE EMPHASIS ON TRANSPARENCY THE EMPHASIS ON ACCOUNTABILITY IS. PARAMOUNT I THINK WHAT- WHAT I WOULD SAY THAT THAT AS I THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE I THINK ONE THING THAT I'VE LEARNED IS THAT. ALL THE INVESTIGATIONS AND ALL THAT ALL THE CHANGES THAT WE MAKE IN OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE CRITICAL TRANSPARENCY IS CRITICAL. BUT I WOULD SAY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE STILL WORKING ON IS HOW WE CHANGE THE CULTURE. OF THESE INSTITUTIONS. AND SOME OF THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT PHYSICAL DESIGN WE HAVE TO LOOK AT LEADERSHIP WE HAVE TO LOOK AT PURPOSE. WE ARE IN OUR COUNTY ARE IN THE PROCESS OF REBUILDING OUR JAIL AND ONE OF THE CONCERT I HAVE ABOUT REBUILDING IT IS THAT WE'RE- BUILDING. A JAIL WHILE WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THE CULTURAL CHANGES WE MOST WANT TO SEE OUR INSTITUTION. ON SO I THINK THE WAY THAT'S PREPARED ME AS BOTH UNDERSTAND THAT. EVEN WITH ALL. THE BEST RULES IN PLACE. YOU CAN STILL HAVE MISTAKES AND WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE AND- AN OBLIGATION TO BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT IT. BECAUSE MORE TRANSPARENT WE ARE THE MORE WE HELP EACH OTHER ACROSS THE STATE REALLY LEFT WHAT I THINK ARE. PRETTY LOW STANDARDS IN SOME INSTANCES. WE'RE. REALLY TRYING TO- FRANKLY IF WE'RE- RISK. ARE INSTITUTIONS HAVE TO REFLECT THAT AND I THINK THAT'S GIVEN ME I HAVE. A PERSPECTIVE THAT'S BOTH ON THE GROUND BUT RECOGNIZING THAT. THERE'S A LOT OF CHANGE THAT COULD HAPPEN STATEWIDE. THANK YOU I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT RESPONSE AND I ALSO. RECOGNIZE THAT THAT JUST HELPS BRING A LOT OF WITH YOU TO THE BOARD- I APPRECIATE ALL THREE OF YOU- RESPOND THANK YOU VENTURE. THANK YOU SENATOR MEADOW VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU MADAM PROVED HIM AND THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU FOR STEPPING FORWARD TO TAKE THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT ASSIGNMENT- I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR ALL THREE REGARDING- RECOMMENDATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN FLOATING AROUND GIVING THE BOARD THE AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE THIS REGULATIONS. SINCE I THINK ONE OF THE TOP PRIORITIES FOR YOUR BOARD IS SETTING STANDARDS FOR INSPECTION OF LOCAL DETENTION FACILITIES. AND THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHETHER YOU SHOULD HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE REGULATIONS AND PERHAPS THE CHALLENGES. ARM YOU KNOW THE HIGH RISKS THAT SHARE OF SPACE IN RUNNING LOCAL JAILS- THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION ARE IF THE BOARD IS GRANTED THAT AUTHORITY AND THAT KIND OF A COMPLICATED QUESTION BUT I BELIEVE THE L. A. O. WHEN I WAS LOOKING OUT TO. THE ROLE AND THE RESPONSIBILITIES AND THE OUTCOMES THAT PERHAPS THE LACK OF A CERTAIN TOOLS FOR ENFORCEMENT MIGHT ENHANCE OUR THE ABILITY OF YOUR OR BOARD TO ACTUALLY DO THE JOB IN TERMS OF. ENFORCEMENT OF THE- SETTING. SO ADAM FOURTEEN MAYBE EACH ONE OF THEM AND CERTAINLY FAR AND OUT IF IT'S A UNCOMFORTABLE QUESTION AND COULD SHE ON THE RECORD WAS SOMETHING ARE YOU CAN BE BIG. BUT I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE FOR US TO UNDERSTAND WHEN THAT COMES OUT OF IN. AN AUDIT TO REVIEW BUYER L. A. OLD OUT THERE MIGHT BE A TOOL IT'S MISSING THAT WOULD HELP YOU MEET ABOUT MOST IMPORTANT PRIORITY. THANK YOU OUR CHIEF MILLS LET ME ASK YOU TO START AND THEN WE'LL GO TO A SUPERVISOR CHÁVEZ AND THEN TO- CHIEF PAINS. SO WHAT SENATOR THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND NOT IT REALLY GETS TO THE HEART OF THE PURPOSE OF THE B. S. YOU SEE AND WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE. IN THE FUTURE AND OBVIOUSLY AS THE SENATE- PRIORITIZE PRIVATE IT ROCKETED TO. DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH YOU WANT TO SEE ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITY AT THE B. S. C. CURRENTLY THERE REALLY IS NONE. OTHER THAN TO CALL PEOPLE TO- THE BSE AND HAVE THEM REPORT OUT AS WE DID I JUST RECENTLY. I THINK THIS YEAR MISPERCEPTION ANI- WAS CALLED TO BE A CC TO TESTIFIED TO EXPLAIN I HAD MET ONE OF THE- CONDITIONS OF THE REGULATIONS OF THE SEC. HE DID A WONDERFUL PRESENTATION WAS ABLE TO LEVERAGE THAT INTO OBTAINING MORE STAFFING IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY MEET. OTHER CRITERIA YES YOU SEE HIMSELF OR SO I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO CONTINUE TO CALL PEOPLE FORWARD HAVE THEM TESTIFY. I DO WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT EACH OF US RECOGNIZES. HOW DIFFICULT A JOB IT IS FOR SHARE RUN A CUSTODY FACILITY NO THAT IS NOT A SIMPLE TASK I WILL FLY THE SHERIFF'S ALL OVER THE STATE FOR THEIR ABILITY TO. RUN AS BEST AS THEY CAN AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS GIVEN LIMITATIONS THAT THEY HAVE OR POLITICALLY AS WELL. AS REPORTS WHY. I PUT IN THE SAME TIME WANT TO MAKE SURE THE STANDARD ARE CAP HIGH AND THAT MAY TWO. IN MAY NEED TO TAKE. ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITY. ARE REGULATED REGULATORY CAPABILITY AT THE BSE THE ONLY THING I WOULD SUGGEST TO THE SENATE. IN THE LEGISLATORS IS THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT. THERE IT'S VERY CLEAR WHERE THE RESOURCES WILL COME FROM. AND SO THAT HOW WE CAN SUPPORT THE STAFF TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND TO DO IT NAY VERY THOUGHTFUL WAY- THIS NOT HEAVY HANDED BUT AT THE SAME TIME REALLY DOES EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HOUSED. AT THE FACILITY AT THE FACILITIES AS WELL AS- THOSE WHO ARE WORKING AT THE FACILITIES. THANK YOU FOR THAT THAT QUESTION. THANK YOU SUPER pAND THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION. I WOULD JUST CAN KERR WITH CHIEF MALES THAT- I THINK HE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT. IS BESTOWED UPON THAT THE SEC IF THAT'S THE WILL OF THAT. THE LEGISLATURE I'M SHOULD BE YOU KNOW WHATEVER RESPONSIBILITY SHOULD HAVE A COMMENSURATE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES SO FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS ONE IS THAT. IF THERE ARE NEW- RESPONSIBILITIES AND YOU WITH THE WORDY GIVEN WE WOULD WANT THE AUTHORITY TO BE MEANINGFUL. AND NOT EVEN IF WE WOULD WANT THE AUTHORITY AND WITH THE COMMUNITIES EXPECTATIONS ARE TO MATCH. UP BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES FOR THE SEC IS THAT THEIR PEOPLE ENOUGH IN THE COMMUNITY YOU THINK THAT IT HAS A LOT MORE. POWER THAN IT THAN IT CURRENTLY DOES TO BE ABLE TO RESOLVE- SOME OF THESE ISSUES SO THAT THAT- SOURCE AND THEN THE COMMENSURATE INDICATIONS OF THAT EVERYBODY REALLY UNDERSTANDS WHAT THE CAPACITY OF THE SEC IS. I THINK WOULD BE IDEAL. THE ONLY OTHER THING I WOULD ADD IS THAT. YOU KNOW THE UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE LEGISLATURE I THINK YOU ALL HAVE BEEN VERY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THE KINDS OF REFORMS AND CHANGES THAT YOU WANT TO SEE ON THE GROUND. I THINK BEING ABLE TO RAISE SOME OF THE MINIMUM STANDARDS AGAINST. SOME MORE CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE STATE- IS VERY IMPORTANT AND I THINK IF THE LEGISLATURE WORK TO- GIVE THE SEC MORE. AUTHORITIES THEN I THINK THE OTHER POINT THAT SHE FELL ST I JUST WANNA RELAX THAT RARITY ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT THAT. THE WHERE YOU THINK THAT- WHAT KIND OF A- TOOL WE WOULD HAVE WOULD BE WITH YOU. OFF I THANK YOU CHIEF. THANK YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME OK- SAM I WAS TOLD THAT MY IDEA WASN'T THAT GREAT WE CAN HEAR YOU GREAT NOW IT WAS SO IT THERE WERE MOMENTS WHERE IT WAS A LITTLE MUFFLED BEFORE BUT WE COULD STILL MAKE IT OUT BUT THIS IS MUCH BETTER THANK YOU OKAY. VERY GOOD OKAY- THANK YOU AGAIN SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION IN ITSELF YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S A COMPLICATED ANSWER IN IN A WAY BECAUSE HAVING GONE THROUGH YES YOU SEE ADDICTS AT MY GLOBAL FACILITY OFFICIALS THEREFORE FOR THE ARTISTS NOT I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE REGARDING THE INSPECTIONS THAT YOU COME INTO THE WORK ON BEHALF OF BSE C. WHICH ARE. PROFESSIONAL FOLKS WHO WORK FOR- JOB OF TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT THE SITUATIONS ARE BRINGING TO LIFE- CONCERNS AROUND- WHAT REGULATIONS MAY- BE- VIOLATION AT THAT TIME THE NAME PROVIDING THE PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ISSUES ARE REALLY- I BELIEVE IF THE YES YOU SEE IF GIVEN THAT AUTHORITY OF INVESTIGATORY FORTY IN ADDITION TO THE REGULATORY FORTY IT JUST IT CHANGES THE RELATIONSHIP. OF A BIT IN IN I THINK IN A WAY THAT I THINK THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT OVER THE YEARS ON WHETHER TO BE ADULT OR A JUVENILE FACILITIES I THINK IT'S ONE THAT'S BEEN. ON. PROFESSIONALISM OF BOTH YOU KNOW- JAILS- STAFF HERE IN OUR JUVENILE WHOLE. AS WELL AND THEN BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE. THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT YOUR FOR THEM TO RUN. ISSUES THAT MAY HAPPY- I. GIVEN THERE FORTY YES HAS NOW IN UNDERSTOOD AND FROM. SHE WAS CORRECT IN WE HAD. MERCED DECADE SHERIFF'S. IN THE- THAT. THAT BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT GETS USED AT THE- BECAUSE OF THE- RECOMMENDATIONS CAME FROM THE PSEC THEY WERE ABLE TO. THE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT TO HAVE ADDITIONAL STAFF. WHICH IS LEADING TO SOME. ABU THAT. SO I'M THAT WOULD BE MY ONLY- REGARD TO- ADDING THAT ADDITIONAL BASKETS WORRYING ASPECT OF THE WORK THAT THE SEC WOULD BE DRAWING- IS THAT THERE THERE COULD BE SOME KIND OF A RELATIONSHIP CHANGE THAT AND- IS THAT THE ANSWER TO THAT- SOME OTHER ENTITY I'M NOT SURE. BUT- I THINK THE REGULATORY AUTHORITY THAT WE DO HAVE NOW WITH THE SEC AND GIVEN THE SUPPORT THAT WE CAN PROVIDE TO FACILITIES ONCE LIKE THINGS ARE UNIFIED- I THINK IT'S- IT'S BEEN. AFFECTED BUT OF COURSE THERE ARE ALWAYS PLACES WHERE WE CAN IMPROVE AND DO SOME MORE. THANK YOU CHIEF WELL THANK YOU ARE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR RESPONSES AS YOU MENTIONED- SHE PAINS IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED. ISSUE AND TO THAT END BRINGING THE STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER TO REALLY TAKE A LONG HARD LOOK AT WHAT MIGHT BE NEEDED AND CERTAINLY THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD FIND ITSELF INTO LEGISLATION I THINK IS A VERY VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO HAVE GOING FORWARD IS VERY DISTURBING TO US CERTAINLY AND TO THE PUBLIC WHEN THESE REPORTS COME OUT ABOUT SOME OF THE DEFICIENCIES IN YOU KNOW- FOR- AND SOME OF. THE INCIDENCES TAKE PLACE IN OUR JAILS I WAS A MEMBER OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND WE HAD A VERY VERY SERIOUS IDEA THE JAILS ARE AT THE HANDS OF SOME OF THE CUSTODIAL MEMBERS SO- I'D LIKE IT TO GO FORWARD- CERTAINLY ARE RISES TO I NEED BUT CERTAINLY ONE THAT HAS TO BE LOOKED AT VERY CAREFULLY AND ENSURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE CONFLICTS WE DON IN SOMEHOW UNDERMINE. ARE YOU MOST IMPORTANT ROLE OF SETTING STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS SO SOMETHING THAT I WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK OUT AND- DO WISH ALL OF YOU WELL I THINK A COMMENT FROM OUR CHIEF HE MEANS I BELIEVE IT WAS REGARD HAD DIFFICULTY IN OUR JAILS IN THE NEW ROLE THAT OUR SHARE OF SAN OUR LOCAL. LAW ENFORCEMENT POLICE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THESE DAYS WE HAVE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROBLEMS IT ALMOST IT THREE ARE CENTER I UNDERSTAND FOR THOSE WHO ARE WIND UP THERE ARE ON TO KEEP MANY OCCASIONS UNFORTUNATELY OF LATE SO- YOU CERTAINLY HAVE MY SUPPORT AND- WILL WORK ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE GOING FORWARD THANKS FOR YOUR THOUGHTS AND CERTAINLY CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR. POINT APPOINTMENT FOR. THANK MADAM VICE- SENATOR TOM. THANK YOU MADAM FOR THANK YOU- TO EACH OF YOU ALL FOR YOUR WORK IN THIS SPACE CHIEF MAILS YOU- MENTIONED THAT YOU WANT TO APPLAUD ALL OF- THE SHERIFF'S AND WHO ARE DOING. VERY HARD WORK MANAGING EACH OF THE JAILS ARE COUNTIES- BUT I UNFORTUNATELY AM NOT GOING TO APPLAUD- ONE AND I COME FROM LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND I HAVE TO SAY WE HAVE A HUGE CHALLENGE WITH OUR- JAILS AND WITH OUR SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT THERE I DO AGREE THAT IT IS NOT EASY WORK- BUT I DO THINK THE WORK NEEDS TO BE HUMANE- I ONLYHAVE TWO QUESTIONS I DO WANT TO SAY- LAST YEAR WHEN I WAS. WORKING TWO OR TWO YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS WORKING ON THE CRISIS ACT ONE OF IT'S A GRANT ADMINISTERED PROGRAM DEALING WITH COMMUNITY RESPONSES TO NINE ONE ONE. AND THERE WAS A DESIRE TO HAVE THE PROGRAM HOUSED IN B. SEC. AND THERE WAS HUGE PUSH BACK. FROM THE ADVOCATES ON WHO REALLY DID NOT FEEL THAT- OUR FORMATIVE PROGRAM LIKE THAT SHOULD BE HOUSED IN THE SEC THEY DIDN'T THINK IT WAS APPROPRIATE. AND THEY DIDN'T THINK THAT- THE BOARD HAD THE ABILITY THE COMPETENCY TO REALLY ADMINISTER IT I'M GIVEN WHAT IT'S TRYING TO ACHIEVE. AND I THINK ABOUT SOME OF THAT RELUCTANCE AND HESITANCY IS BECAUSE OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE COME UP IN. AUDITS AND ARTICLES I'M OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS ABOUT WHAT. IS GOING ON AND THE FACT THERE THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY CONSEQUENCES. FOR- DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE. SO YOU KNOW WHEN I THE AUDITED. THREE JAIL SYSTEMS THREE DEPARTMENTS THREE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT THE ALAMEDA FRESNO AND LOS ANGELES BECAUSE OF SO MANY REPORTS THAT WERE COMING OUT FROM EACH OF THOSE COUNTIES ABOUT THINGS THAT WERE HAPPENING AND YOU KNOW THE AUDIT WAS NOT GREAT- IT WAS NOT GREAT SO MY FIRST QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH DATA BECAUSE- YOU ALL MENTIONED THAT. AND IT DOES SEEM THAT. HI THERE THE PROVIDE THE PROFILE SURVEYS OUR VOLUNTARY FOLKS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO SUBMIT INFORMATION- BECAUSE IT'S VOLUNTARY WHAT'S COLLECTED IS VERY LIMITED- AND THERE ISN'T A LOT OF INFORMATION I THINK THAT PROBABLY IS GLEANED FROM THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE ASKED- REGARDLESS OF HOW PEOPLE RESPOND TO THEM SO I JUST LIKE TO KNOW FROM EACH OF YOU. ARM DO YOU THINK YOU YOU SAID WE NEED MORE DATA AND MORE DATA IS IMPORTANT WHAT KIND OF DATA WOULD BE HELPFUL TO YOU THAT IS NOT BEING COLLECTED NOW THAT YOU COULD USE TO HELP BETTER INFORM DECISIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS AND STANDARDS. THAT COME FROM THE BOARD. THANK YOU AND YOU WANT THAT OF ALL THREE YES THANK YOU- CHIEF PAINS LET ME ALLOW YOU TO GO FIRST- THIS TIME AND THEN WE'LL GO TO CHIEF MILLS AND THEN- SUPERVISOR TRAVIS. THANK YOU- CENTER KAMLAGER FOR. WESTERN IRAQ. WERE WE WERE I MEAN FOR AS WELL. YEAH YEAH- ASSEMBLY WITH IN THAT WE ARE A LOT OF WAS WATCHING SOME CHIEF WE ARE WE ARE NOW HAVING A LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE HEARING YOU AGAIN SO LET'S SAW. I SEE IF WE CAN OMEHOW MAKE THAT BETTER YOU ARE DOING GREAT- HELLO. KEEP TALKING CHIEF WILL WILL ASSESS THAT SITUATION WILL DO AN INSPECTION AND DETERMINE. RIGHT BUT AGAIN THANK YOU US UNDERGROUND WATER. WE ARE WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT YOU KNOW IT AS WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THE AUDIT THAT ON THE FRESNO. SHARES THE PARTY DID HAVE IS YOUR TAKING A LOOK AT- SOMEBODY THERE ARE NOT SOME VEHICLES YOU THAT'S WHERE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THE AUDIT- TOOK A LOOK AT I'M TAKING A LOOK AT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THE- COMMITTEE CORRECTIONS PARTNERSHIP- AND HOW. WE COULD SUPPORT- MORE PROGRAMMING IN THE THINGS THAT COULD BE HAPPENING THERE YOU KNOW WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF DATA COULD HELP TO HELP TO DETERMINE WHAT KINDS OF THINGS CAN IN JAILS BENEFIT FROM. OUR SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE BASS- RECENTLY WITH THE SAN DIEGO SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IS TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND HEALTH. ASSESSMENTS ARE BEING ADMINISTERED- HELP GET AN IDEA GETTING AN IDEA OF A BASELINE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN JAIL TODAY SO THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT AND SEE ARE THEIR BEST PRACTICES THAT ARE HAPPENING ACROSS THE STATE. ESPECIALLY AMOUNTS ARE OUR BIGGER FACILITY RIGHT SO I THINK LOOKING AT BACK HUNDRED DOWN. TO DETERMINE WHAT KINDS OF THINGS R. THE JAILS WILL BE BEFORE WE DON'T SEE THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES HAPPEN ESPECIALLY IN OUR LARGER FACILITIES WHAT WHAT ARE THEY GOING RIGHT WHAT ARE THEY DOING THAT OTHER FACILITIES WILL NOT BE DOING. BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT'S THE ROLE OF YES. IS TAKE A LOOK. AT THE STATE WIDE. OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING. IN ALL. HE THIS UPSIDE LOWER- AMONGST THE- AND SO. I THINK THE BSE'S CARE- YEAH THE SERVER DATA OF THE FROM. WHICH CAN ALLOW FOR. IT LOCATION IDEAS ENTERED IN EVIDENCE RECEIVING ALCOHOL- TO BE ABLE TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT ARE THE GOOD I WHAT OF THINGS HAPPENING THOSE INTEGRATION BACK FAMILIAR- L. PROGRAM THAT'S BEING OFFERED. TO OUR TO OUR FOLKS BETTER CUSTODY. WHAT KIND OF. THINGS CAN- REQUIRED. THE JAILS PROVIDE SO THAT WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE THINGS THAT ARE WORKING. TO THE BEST OF THEIR ABILITY AND THEN WITH THAT INFORMATION THE SEC WHICH I BELIEVE- DOES HAVE THE ABILITY. TO BE ABLE TO ADMINISTER ARE. YOU KNOW BRINGING ABOUT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO IMPROVE THROUGH- BROWN OPPORTUNITIES- OR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO BE ABLE TO SEE SOME BETTER. THANK YOU. I CAN DO THAT BETTER THAT WAS GOOD THAT WAS GOOD I BELIEVE EVERYBODY WAS ABLE TO HEAR THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH- SUPERVISOR SERVICE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT QUESTION IT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE US SENATOR AND- AND LET ME JUST GIVE A COUPLE OF. BROAD OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE KIND OF INFORMATION I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR US TO UNDERSTAND AGAIN LOOKING BOTH AT PARTICULAR FACILITIES BUT ALSO STATEWIDE. ONE IS THAT RIGHT NOW- AS YOU ALL KNOW. THE PEOPLE WHO COME INTO CUSTODY FOR THE MOST PART ARE RELATIVELY UNHEALTHY- FROM A POPULATION PERSPECTIVE. AND KNOWING WHAT SOMEONE'S HEALTH IS WHEN THEY ENTER- AND WHETHER OR NOT THEIR HEALTH IS. WHAT KINDS OF SERVICES THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS. IS REALLY CRITICAL SO FOR EXAMPLE. WHAT ARE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE THEY GET MENTAL HEALTH SCREENINGS HOW MANY OF THEM END UP WITH THE DIAGNOSIS HOW MANY OF THEM ARE GETTING MEDICATION. YOU KNOW I THAT THAT ALL OF THAT INFORMATION WILL HELP US UNDERSTAND BOTH THE POPULATIONS THAT ARE COMING IN. HOW BETTER TO STRUCTURE THAT THE- EM MEDICAL SERVICES THAT ARE NOW. AND MAKE SURE THAT THE SERVICES ARE IN A WAY THAT REALLY DO GIVE PEOPLE THE BEST OPPORTUNITY FOR AGAIN NOT TO RECEIVE A- AN EXAMPLE OF THAT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES I'VE SEEN EVEN LOCALLY IS THAT- THERE ARE SO MANY CONCERNS ABOUT HALF FIVE. BUT NOT EVERYBODY IS IN THE JAIL HAS ACCESS TO THE TO THE INFORMATION THAT COULD HELP THEM ACTUALLY SUPPORT PEOPLE. ON THEIR WAY OUT AND SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF ISSUES THAT IF WE IF WE WERE ABLE TO GATHER DATA BOTH SPECIFIC INSTITUTE. WHAT THE TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND THEN BETTER UNDERSTAND. HOW TO UTILIZE THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE LOWERING RECIDIVISM AS AN EXAMPLE- ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT I THOUGHT THE L. A- REACHED OUT THAT. THEN I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING WAS REPORTING ON DEATHS IN A MORE ROBUST WAY. I THINK REPORTING TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR SOMEWHERE THAT REALLY DOES MAKE. THAT ADD SUNSHINE TO THAT. IS REALLY IMPORTANT- AND PART OF THE REASON FOR THAT I THINK IS THAT IF EVERYBODY HAS TO. HAVE REPORTS THAT ARE CONSISTENT AND CLEAR. AND OPPORTUNITY TO THE LOOKOUT WHAT ARE THE CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE MADE IN EACH FACILITY. AND THEN IN AGGREGATE WHAT ARE THE CHANGES THAT WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT. ON THAT WILL IMPROVE THE- SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF THOSE ARC STUDIO CARE AND AGAIN. YEAH WELL THE MEASURE THE INPUTS WE HAVE WHAT THE RECIDIVIST. I'M OUT. THANK YOU OUR CHIEF MILLS. THANK YOU AT THE CENTER CALM WATER FOR THE FOR THE QUESTION AND I. IN MY SENSE WE NEED A DATE AT TWO LEVELS ONE IS AT THE MACRO LEVEL WHAT'S HAPPENING STATEWIDE WHERE THE TRENDS. ARE THERE ARE CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN HOUSE THAT IMPACT THE LOCAL FACILITY AND THEN AT THE MICRO LEVEL. WE ALSO NEED. BETTER DATA IN TERMS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING INSIDE FACILITIES THERE'S- A SERIES OF USES OF FORCE IS FOR INSTANCE ON. INMATES WIRELESS TAKING PLACE AND WHAT IS THAT DATA LOOK LIKE ARE WE EVEN CAPTURING THE RIGHT DATA AND UP MY I'M SUSPICIOUS THAT WERE PROBABLY NOT. I CAPTURE THE RIGHT DATA. SO I SEE THE DATA NEED TO COME OUT AT TWO DIFFERENT LEVELS. FOR INSTANCE I WAS MENTIONED BY CHIEF HAYNES- THE- BY THE JAILS THE LOCAL JAILS HAVE BECOME THE LARGEST MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY IN THE STATE. IN TRYING TO RUN A FACILITY WHERE THAT IS PRESENT AND ALONG WITH THE ENORMOUS ADDICTION PROBLEMS. THAT IS WHERE WE NEED THE INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THE BEST WAY TO RUN THESE FACILITIES SO THAT WHEN WE PROMULGATE A REGULATION THAT ALLOWS US TO. BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT HOW WE'RE DOING AT. AND THEN THE LAST PART OF THAT IS THE INFORMATION THAT IS NEEDED- IS WHAT WHAT COUNTIES ARE BEING THOUGHTFUL ABOUT HOW THEY REPORT OUT FOR INSTANCE DURING COVERED THEIR WORDS THERE WERE DEPARTMENTS JUST CHOSE NOT TO GIVE THE INFORMATION AND THAT CANNOT E ACCEPTABLE AND NOT IN A STATE BUT- BSE IS POWERLESS TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT OTHER THAN TO NOTATE IT. AND ALLOW THE DECISION MAKERS WHICH ARE THE PEOPLE ON THE COUNTIES PEOPLE LIKE TO THE SHERIFF'S I DO HAVE THAT INFORMATION IF THEY CHOOSE TO SEEK IT OUT I SAID THEY CAN MAKE A DETERMINATION ON WHAT pKIND OF LEADERS. DO THEY WANT PLACE. THANK YOU FOR THAT I THINK. I AGREE THERE SHOULD BE ARM. MUCH MORE TEETH THAT YOU ALL HAVE I MEAN I YOU KNOW. YOU CAN HAVE STANDARDS- BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO HAVE CONSEQUENCES IF THINGS AREN'T BEING FOLLOWED- AND SO I AGREED THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT GIVING THE BOARD GREATER AUTHORITY- A END. I THINK SOME CONCERN IS. WOULD THIS GIVEN THE MAKEUP OF THE BOARD IS THIS A BOARD THAT CAN LEVY- YOU KNOW ENFORCEMENT THE AND CONSEQUENTIAL DECISIONS- TO COLLEAGUES YOU KNOW THE FOLKS KIND OF FROM THE SAME STRIPES AND SO THAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE HOPEFULLY IS THAT THE- HOPEFULLY YOU ALL ARE HAVING OR WILLING TO ENGAGE IN DISCUSSIONS AROUND THAT. BECAUSE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CULTURE CHANGE YOU KNOW THAT'S ALSO A PART OF IT. YOU KNOW MY SECOND QUESTION REALLY STEMS FROM THAT AND IT'S SPECIFIC TO LOS ANGELES COUNTY- I THINK- A SUPERVISOR CHÁVEZ MENTIONED THAT YOU GET INFORMATION OBVIOUSLY FROM DOING LOTS OF READING AND THERE ARE TONS OF NEWSPAPER ARTICLES THAT HAVE COME OUT ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR L. A. COUNTY JAILS. I HAVE ONE HERE THAT WAS DONE MAYBE JUST A WEEK OR SO AGO THAT. TALKS ABOUT YOU KNOW HUMILIATING STRIP SEARCHES AND PUNCHING INCARCERATED PEOPLE IN THE HEAD AND HAVING FOLKS WALK AROUND. YOU KNOW WITHOUT. UNDERWEAR OR SHOES YOU KNOW- STILL USING THE RAP DEVICE- WHICH IT IS THIS IS A CONTINUING PRACTICE SHOULD CANNOT BE JUSTIFIED- AND SO. IF FOLKS ARE NOT I MEAN SO WHAT IS GOING ON IT'S REALLY THE QUESTION WHAT IS GOING ON AND WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO BECAUSE IT IS EVIDENCE THAT WHILE ARM. SHARESARE PART OF A LOCAL SYSTEM IN THE JAIL AS PART OF A LOCAL SYSTEM AND YOU HAVE A LOCAL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IT ALSO SEEMS LIKE SOME OF THESE ENTITIES NEED SOME HELP FROM THE STATE. AND SO. I MEAN WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS. DO YOU ARE LET'S PICK A PERSON I. LET LET YOU KNOW I IT'S SO HARD WE HAVE A COURT REPORTER WHO TRANSIT IN NAMES AND SO LET ME DO LET ME JUST STEP RIGHT IN AND- SUPERVISOR CHÁVEZ IT ANYTHING YOU WANT TO SAY IN RESPONSE TO THIS AND THEN I'LL O TO CHIEF MILLS AND THEN- CHIEF PAINS. YES- YOU KNOW I. AS CENTER COME UNDER I THINK THAT THE FIRST QUESTION YOU ASKED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN HOLD EACH OTHER ACCOUNTABLE. IS A FAIR QUESTION LIKE AND I AND I WILL SAY I'VE I'VE- BEEN ON THE BOARD. FOR A VERY SHORT TIME MY OBSERVATION IS THAT BOTH MYSELF AND MY COLLEAGUES TO DO THAT. I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT- WHEN YOU DECIDE YOU WANT TO BE OUT OF WORK LIKE THIS THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ONE OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF IT IS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE- YOU. YOU YOU ARE GETTING IN THERE BECAUSE YOU THINK THINGS CAN BE BETTER. AND YOU YOU'RE GOING TO BE HEARD ON THAT AND YOU YOU WANT TO BE HEARD ON THAT SO THAT THAT'S ONE THING I WOULD JUST ACKNOWLEDGE ABOUT MY COLLEAGUES AND I THINK. THE OTHER IS THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING THE TWO FOLKS ON THE BOARD THAT HAVE LIVED EXPERIENCE IS REALLY CRITICAL. TO SHEDDING LIGHT AND REALLY REINFORCING WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE. I DO WANT TO JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THE LIMITATIONS OF THE SEC'S. AUTHORITY AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING- OF YOU KNOW. BACK AND FORTH I. YOU KNOW AS TO WHAT'S HAPPENING SPECIFICALLY IN LOS ANGELES THANK YOU KNOW MY INFORMATION IS REALLY MORE FROM- FROM READING AND I WILL JUST MAKE ONE OBSERVATION. THAT THE PRODUCTS ARE PATIENT AND IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THEIR- THEIR SUFFERING AND THAT THEY'RE IN TROUBLE AND THAT IN I DON'T I DON'T MEAN. WITH ANYBODY I MEAN THAT THERE'S TROUBLE OUT THERE. I THINK WHAT THAT MEANS IS ABSOLUTELY THAT THERE'S A WALL BOTH FOR. THE FCC TO WAIT AGAIN. AND FOR THE STATE TO LOOK AT WHETHER OR NOT THE KEY WORDS THAT COME OUT OF THE- THE INVEST. ONE IT SHOULD BE LIKE JUST IT AND I'LL JUST GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE THEY ARE THAT MAY BE AN OPPORTUNITY AND MAYBE. OR NOT. SO WHEN I LOOKED AT THE- ELLIE OCI EVALUATE. SORRY AUDIT OF. GO ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS STRUCK BY WAS I THOUGHT OH THIS IS A GREAT RECOMMENDATION ON. HOW WE REPORT GAS. PUTTING THAT IN THE HANDS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR MAKING THAT PUBLIC. I LOOKED AT THE MEDICAL RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE QUESTION I HAD WAS. WHAT WOULD MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS SAY ABOUT THIS COMPONENT OF IT. AND SO I'M NOT SURE WHICH OF THOSE PIECES NEEDS TO BE EMBEDDED IN LEGISLATION BECAUSE YOU'D ALWAYS FIND. OUT THE- BEST PRACTICES. EIGHT AND SO. I SAY THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THESE CASES THAT WE NEED TO DIVE IN AS DEEP AS WE- CAN. SO THAT THE SOLUTIONS. THAT WE SEE. CAN BE PROPERLY DETERMINED WHAT SHOULD BE LEGISLATIVE. WHAT SHOULD BE A DIFFERENT KIND. OF PRACTICE I DON'T KNOW ALL OF THE TOOLS THAT I WOULD ONE. I WANT TO GET MORE THOUGHT TO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE- SORRY CHIEF MILLS. YES THANK YOU- I THINK WE'RE ALL VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE CONDITIONS AND THE L. A. COUNTY SYSTEM BOTH AT THE I'D AT THE JAIL LEVELS WELLS THAT YOU'VE IN ALL LEVELS ARE THESE ARE- SUBSTANTIAL ISSUES I KNOW IT'S BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF EFFORT AND I HAVE I MY TENURE ON THE BSE WHICH HAS NOT BEEN THAT LONG IT JUST FEW YEARS. THIS IS BEEN THE STRONGEST YES THIS YEAR HAS BEEN IN TERMS OF TRYING TO HOLD A SYSTEM ACCOUNTABLE I THINK THAT THERE IS A LACK OF AUTHORITY TO ACTUALLY DO SOME OF THOSE THINGS HOWEVER- BECAUSE THIS IS A DEMOCRACY IN AND THE- SHERIFF WAS ELECTED I THINK THAT THERE IS SOME- RIGHT THAT GOES WITH THAT. HOWEVER WHEN YOU'RE SEEING SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS THAT IS WHEN THE STATE SHOULD STEP IN. THAT IS WHEN THE STATE SHOULD- HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE NOT WHATEVER FORMAT THAT LOOKS LIKE I AM NOT SURE- BUT I THAT COULD BE GIVEN TO THE BSE AS LONG AS THE- ABILITY TO DO IT. IS ALL THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT. THE LAST THING I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION IS. PEOPLE CONFUSE THE COUNTY JAIL SYSTEM. WITH THE CAPACITY IN THE ABILITY OF THE STATE PRISON SYSTEM. I WE'VE MADE A CONSCIOUS DECISION IN THE STATE TO BE INSTITUTIONALIZED PRESENCE I THINK THAT'S INAPPROPRIATE- MMHM PROCEDURE AND AN ID IDEOLOGY HOWEVER THE EXECUTION OF IT IS VERY IMPORTANT ADD TO INCARCERATE PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE IN A IN A STATE PENAL INSTITUTION FOR YOU KNOW FOR YEARS KEEPING AMANDA AT THE LOCAL LEVEL HAS REALLY MADE A VERY COMPLEX AND MORE COMPLEX THAN IT NEEDS TO BE SO THAT IS PART OF THE SOLUTION THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER. AND TO THINK THROUGH AS WE DO THAT- BECAUSE IT IS OVERWHELMING I THINK FOR MAYBE THE LOCAL INSTITUTIONS- THAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO ACTUALLY A SMALL CYMBALS PROBLEMS. THANK YOU CHIEF CHIEF HAYNES. THANK YOU. WEST NO MORE ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING YOU SHOULD BE WE WILL ARE NOT HEARING YOU AGAIN I'M SO SORRY- BUT WE WANT TO HEAR YOU. YEAH YOU'RE- YEAH CAN YOU HEAR ME. FAMOUS LAST WORDS I YOU'RE ON MUTE AND CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW THE- I APPRECIATE CHIEF MILLS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE L. A. COUNTY SYSTEM AS A WHOLE BECAUSE OF COURT THAT I MADE OUR LAST YES YOU SEE IT. IS THAT. YOU KNOW THE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN LOS ALAMOS LOS ANGELES BOTH MEN IN THE ADULT SYSTEM AND IN THE IN OUR DOUBLE FAULT IS THAT IT'S ON EXCEPT- THERE IS NO REASON WHY SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU TALK ABOUT SYNERGY CAPITAL. THE STAFF IN THERE ARE WAYS FOR- DEPARTMENTS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A LOOK AT- HOW USE THE FORCE ARE HAPPENING WITHIN THEIR FACILITIES. THERE ARE- SAFETY PROTOCOLS- PROTOCOLS FOR USE THE FORCE THERE IS A SINGLE. USE OF FORCE THAT SHOULD BE. THAT SHOULD BE HAPPENING IT DOESN'T OPEN STEPS OUTSIDE OF WHAT THE- WITH A FIFTY SAID. THERE HAS TO BE A MEANS FOR- STAFF TO BE ABLE TO BRING THAT UP IT HAS TO BE A NEED FOR- GARCIA PERSONS TO BE ABLE TO BRING. THOSE KINDS OF- CONCERNS TO THE TO THE- TO THE ATTENTION OF STAFF INTO. THE ADMINISTRATIVE. THAT'S THERE THAT'S WE DO IN OUR TO FACILITY THAT'S WHAT HAPPEN- IN LOS. IT'S YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S A- I CAN UNDERSTAND THE STATE THE WASHINGTON REALLY- PROVIDES ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT AND- EVEN SOME MANDATE TO WHAT NEEDS TO BE HAPPENING IN IN LOS ANGELES. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE SAID IS THAT LOS ANGELES REALLY NEEDS TO. YOUR GRACE THIS THEMSELF- TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN L. A. COUNTY THE COMMUNITY REALLY DOES NEED TO GET A ONE PAGE RELIEF TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE BEST REMEDY FOR WHAT YOU WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE ADULT SYSTEM WHAT'S HAPPENING AND DIVORCES. AND SOME KIND OF INVESTMENT IN WHAT THE FACILITIES REQUIRED WHAT KIND OF INVESTMENT YOU MAKE IN THEIR FORTIES FOR TRAINING- FOR- THE ABILITY. FOR I CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT. ADDITIONAL THINGS THAT NEED TO BE. IN LOS WHERE. YOU IN ADULTS YOUR- TO- BE ABLE TO MAKE- COMPLAINTS IN OUR FAMILY MEMBERS TO BE ABLE TO BRING THOSE THINGS FORTY FOR THEM TO BE ACTED UPON. IT MAY MEAN I'M SOME KIND OF OBVIOUS ADVERTISEMENT THAT HELPS TO DO THOSE KINDS OF FORMS AND IN THAT COUNTY. THERE NEEDS TO BE THAT KIND OF THE SYSTEM THAT'S SET UP- SO THAT THOSE THINGS CAN HAPPEN BECAUSE SHE FEELS IS RIGHT. THINK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE ONE NINE. IT SOME FACILITIES. OR JUST BILL. TO FOR YEARS AT A TIME- AND SO IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME COMMITMENT FROM THE STATE I THINK TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL SO THAT WE CAN BUILD QUALITY FACILITY. THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR FACILITIES AT THE SAME TIME BSE'S NEED TO BE ABLE TO FIGHT FOR THE RIGHTS OF CONSTRUCTION STRUCTURAL FAULTS YOU. THE PROGRAM. IN ORDER TO- TO. AT LEAST TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING THE KIND OF THINGS THAT YOU TALK ABOUT SORT OF THE RATHER MEETING THIS MORNING WILL YOUR WORK DONE FOR THE MURDER OF POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE HOMELESS SITUATION AND IT'S- A HUGE PROBLEM HERE IN FRESNO COUNTY IN I CAN. SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING SOME OF OUR JAIL SYSTEM IT'S MORE IT'S MORE THAN JUST ONE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT IN A COMPREHENSIVEWAY VOTE BY SYSTEMS WORKING OUT OF HIS MOUTH THIS IS MORE THAN A FOR THE LAKE COUNTY PROBATION OR DALY. BOB L. A. COUNTY TO ADDRESS BECAUSE I KNOW SHE ENOUGH IS ARE YOU ALL OF THESE ARTISTS IN ORDER TO MOVE ALL OF MY FOR NASA JUST CAL BOTH THOSE ARE PEOPLE MAKING CO BEFORE. THEY NEED TO BE ALL OF TABLE ON THE SAME PAGE FIGURE OUT WHAT THE SOLUTION. THANK YOU THAT SHE PAINS I YOU KNOW I- I AGREE WITH YOU THAT L. A. DOES NEED TO WORK IT OUT AND GET IT TOGETHER. THE OTHER PART OF THAT IS THAT LA IS YOU KNOW. IN MY OPINION. THE SHERIFF AND THE DEPARTMENT IS A WEAK LINK IN A STATE CHANGE- AND THAT IN THAT MEANS THAT EVERYONE IS CONNECTED. AND YOU KNOW I ALSO SEE L. A. AS A CLARION CALL BECAUSE THE LONGER IT TAKES TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES. THAT ARE GOING ON IN LATE AND SOME OTHER COUNTY QUITE FRANKLY YOU KNOW THE MORE PUNITIVE LEGISLATION WILL BECOME AND THE LESS RELEVANT SOME BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS WILL BE SEEN. AND SO I'M JUST CHARGING THAT EVERYONE CONTINUE TO ROLL UP THEIR SLEEVES AND TALK ABOUT COLLECTIVELY WHAT WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION. IN OUR COUNTIES AS IT RELATES TO OUR ADULT IN OUR JUVENILE FACILITIES- I ALSO WANT TO GO BACK TO THE FACT THAT YES I AM- ALSO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING THE PUBLIC MEMBER- AND THE COMMUNITY PROVIDER- BUT THAT'S STILL JUST. A LOT OF THIRTEEN AND THE MAJORITY OF THE FOLKS THAT ARE ON THE BOARD HAVE SOME- HISTORY WITH- YOU KNOW LAW ENFORCEMENT- OR CORRECTIONS. AND SO THAT STILL CAN SKEW PERSPECTIVES AND DISCUSSIONS AND MAYBE EVEN POSSIBLY DECISIONS AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU KNOW AND MAYBE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO. MORE DIVERSITY GUARDS TO YOU KNOW BACKGROUNDS AND- BUT THAT'S NOT ABOUT THIS SO I MIGHT GET OFF THAT WILL SOAPBOX. AND I WANT TO SAY- THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS- AND- FOR ACTUALLY ANSWERING MY COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS AS WELL. THANK YOU SENATOR COME LONGER- SENATOR GROWTH. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM I APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE WITH ME AS I BOUNCE BACK AND FORTH- ED I KNOW I MISSED SOME OF THE COMMENTS BUT I DID CATCH THE COMMENTS ABOUT- APPLAUDING OR SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT I THINK YOU FOR THAT BECAUSE I THINK WITH AB ONE OH NINE. OF COVIDIEN NOT HAVING PRISONER TRANSFER BETWEEN FACILITIES TO. OF OTHER STATE RUN FACILITIES I THINK THAT OUR SHARES HAVE DONE AN OUTSTANDING JOB. OF MAKING SURE THAT- THE PEOPLE ARE SAFE AT. THE END THINGS ARE TAKEN CARE OF. I THINK THAT OUR LOCAL SHERIFF'S OFFICES ARE LOCAL JAILS HAVE BECOME. A BECAUSE OF THE SITUATIONS WITH ONE OH NINE AND CO THAT THEY HAVE BECOME A MORE AT THE PENITENTIARY OUR PRISON SYSTEM VERSUS A- BRIEF STAGIONE SYSTEM FOR TRANSFER ABILITY TO OTHER. FACILITIES THAT ARE BETTER MAINTAINED TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE LONG TERM RESIDENTS. AND SO THANK YOU FOR APPLAUDING THAT I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND HE PAINS IF IT'S OKAY I'D LIKE TO START WITH YOU WE ARE DIRECTING THEM AND IF YOU GUYS CAN OKAY STEVEN HAYNES AND I'D LIKE TO START WITH YOU IF THAT'S OKAY. YEAH M. AS A PROBATION CHIEF AND AS SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN THE CHIEF ADMINISTRATION OVER JUVENILE HALL WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON SHIFTING THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL YOUNG PEOPLE IN JUVENILE THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM TO THE COUNTIES. AND DOES HE- DO YOU THE COUNTIES HAVE ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICE TO THESE JUVENILES- THESE JUVENILES- I I'M CONCERNED MY CONCERN IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO TRANSFER THEM ALL TO THE LOCAL COUNTIES. AND THEY WOULD NORMALLY BE TAKEN CARE OF IN SOME CASES BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION SO. A CAN YOU GIVE ME YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. OKAY YES SIR- FOR. YES BIGELOW NOPE YOU WENT AWAY S. I'M SORRY THAT CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW YES SIR MMHM. OKAY YES YES YES. HARBINSON HERE TO- STEP BACK- FROM C. FROM A PART HELLO. HOWEVER I WILL SAY THIS IS THAT OUR FACILITIES ARE NOT EQUIPPED JUST LIKE- I JUST TALKED ABOUT THE FACILITIES AND ON THE ADULT SIDE OUR FACILITIES IN- INDIVIDUALS FACE ARE NOT EQUIPPED TO HOLD YOUNG PEOPLE FOR- YEARS AT A TIME THE SYSTEMS WERE NEVER SET UP FOR THAT AND- WE ARE GOING TO NEED THE STATE SUPPORT IN ORDER TO GET OUR FACILITIES TO A POINT IN NOT IN AND I DON'T TALK ABOUT THIS IN TERMS OF JUST HAVING SPACE TO BE ABLE TO HOLD HERE- WHERE YOU KNOW SO THAT THEY HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO SLEEP. BUT ALSO. BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT WE ALSO NEED TO HAVE THE PROPER PROGRAM FACING ORDER TO PROVIDE THE PROPER. THAT THE- YOU NEED TO HAVE AN ABILITY STEP DOWN. FROM THE FROM A MORE. SECURE SETTING TO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW THEM TO BE. TO GO OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY TO BE ABLE TO GO TO COLLEGE TO BE ABLE TO GET PART TIME JOBS- TO BE ABLE TO DO THOSE KINDS OF THINGS IN A WAY THAT IS REALLY WELL INFORMED BY TREATMENT PLANT. ALLOWING US TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THOSE STEPS ALONG THE WAY. OUR SYSTEM NOW WE'RE NOT SET UP IN THE IN THE STATE IS MADE SOMEWHAT OF A COMMUNITY. IN THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING INVESTIGATE TWENTY THREE BUT WE ARE A LONG WAY. FROM BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE WHAT I BELIEVE IS A COMPREHENSIVE NEED FOR US TO BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY- BOTH OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE FROM JJ. INTO OUR FACILITIES AND THEN BACK OUT HOME TO THEIR COMMUNITIES- OF COURSE WE ARE. FARMERS WE'VE BEEN. THIS WORK FOR A LONG TIME AT THE LOCAL LEVEL YOU ARE- KING- BEST PRACTICES WE'VE GOT A TRACK RECORD OF DOING THIS KIND OF WORK. FOR THE LAST DECADE NOT ALL TALK ABOUT FRESNO. BACK WHEN I RAN MY FACILITY ZERO SEVEN SEVEN EIGHT YEARS AGO- I HAD OVER THREE HUNDRED FEET. IN OUR REGULAR HOME TODAY GOT THIRD OF THAT TODAY AND IT'S BECAUSE OF THE GOOD WORK THAT WE CAN JOIN HERE LOCAL. A 90% OF THE YOUTH ACROSS THE STATE OUR SERVER ADVOCACY WE WANT TO TRY TO REDUCE THAT NUMBER EVEN. MORE WILL BE. THE RESOURCE- THAT THE STATE WILL ALLOW FOR THE BURDENS TO- BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY. TO MOVE THIS FORWARD BUT OUR WE READY RIGHT NOW APPS. RIGHT BUT WE WE'RE GONNA NEED FOR THE- RESOURCES IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN DO THIS A WAY. THAT WE SEE IS THE BEST WAY. I YOU SIR AND I THINK YOU HIGHLIGHTING WHAT YOU THE- IN FRESNO BECAUSE I DID I READ I READ A LOT ABOUT THAT. AND I DO AGREE THAT YOU WRAPAROUND SERVICES YOU CAN'T JUST HOUSE THEM- THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME TYPE OF. EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS GOING TO BE JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING. TO GIVE THEM SOME TYPE OF A- HELLO THERE'S A BIBLE SCRIPTURE THAT SAYS YOU KNOW A HOPE AND A FUTURE. RIGHT AND SO- I DO AGREE WITH THAT AND SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HIGHLIGHTING THAT AND I APPRECIATE ALL THE YEARS. THAT YOU'VE INVESTED IN- LAW ENFORCEMENT. WITH YOUR LAW ENFORCEMENT CAREER AND I THINK IT- THAT IN YOUR HEART AND PASSION FOR THE YOUTH IN OUR COMMUNITIES A- AND- AND JUST YOUR ABILITY TO. AT LEAST PEOPLE WILL- IS A GREAT THIS IS A GREAT STEP UP FOR YOU SIR FOR YOU TO BE APPOINTED THIS POSITION SO THANK YOU FOR- ACCEPTING IT. THANK YOU. M. DIRECTOR OF OUR SKEWS ME CHIEF MILLS I- HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU IF IT'S OKAY. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE BOARD SHOULD BE PROVIDED WITH AN ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM. IN WHAT TYPE OF ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM WOULD YOU SEE LIKE TO SEE IF IT WERE DEVELOPED OVER THE FACILITIES. WELL CENTER THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- IT WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE THE SENATE'S PREROGATIVE SHOULD THEY WANT TO GO THAT DIRECTION BUT I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE THOUGHTFUL AND PROPERLY RESOURCE- TO ME IT MIGHT MAKE MORE SENSE THAT IF WE WERE GOING TO GO THAT DIRECTION THERE WOULD BE MORE OF AN INVESTIGATIVE ARM THAT WOULD GO TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE INFORMATION TO THEM. BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH A COMPLEX. AREA OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. THEY'RE REALLY TAKES PEOPLE WITH DEEP KNOWLEDGE. TO BE ABLE TO GO AND REALLY FIND OUT THE FACTUAL IN THE IN THE ACCURATE INFORMATION. SO IF WE'RE GOING TO BE I WANNA MAKE SURE IT'S DOURSON'S STOPS. I TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S- THOROUGHNESS. TRANSPARENCY AS WELL AS- SECONDARY I USED TO MAKE SURE THAT- IT'S BEING DONE THE RIGHT WAY. I APPRECIATE THAT RESPONSE AND THANK YOU AND I KNOW IT'S IN THE SENATE'S PURVIEW BUT YOU KNOW I'VE NEVER BEEN A CHIEF OF POLICE THEM I DON'T THINK ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE I KNOWN MY COLLEAGUES TO MY LEFT IS BEEN. SECRETARY OF NATURAL RESOURCES. BUDGET MUCH. I AM SO I WAS JUST INTERESTED IN YOUR OPINION AND I APPRECIATE THAT VERY- THAT VERY THOUGHTFUL RESPONSE THANK YOU SIR AND AGAIN I'M BOUNCING BACK AND. CHÁVEZ AYE I DO HAVE A QUESTION- FOR YOU IF THAT'S OKAY. M. IT THE OTHER PANEL MEMBERS HAVE AN EXTENSIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT BACKGROUND A POLICE CHIEF OF POLICE OFFICERS PROBATION OFFICERS A SUCCESS IN THE PARK VERY MUCH SUCCESS WHICH HE PAINS IN THE FRESNO COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENT IN THE JUVENILE PROGRAM JUSTICE FOR THEM THAT THEY HAVE IN PLACE THERE- A- BLUE RIBBON EQUITY PANELS THERE'S JUST A LONG LIST. WITH WITH FED CHIEF MILLS AND WITH- BUT- CHIEF PAINS AND SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THAT I AM WITH THE INFORMATION THAT YOU SUBMITTED RULES UNLESS IT WASN'T SOME FULLY AND COMPLETELY SUBMITTED I YOU'RE A COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS CORRECT OR FORMER COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. I AM CURRENTLY A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND SANTA CLARA COUNTY OKAY SO CURRENTLY A MEMBER I DON'T SEE LAW ENFORCEMENT BACKGROUND IS IT MISS ENOUGH THAT THIS INFORMATION IS SUBMITTED. NO I'VE NEVER HELD A POSITION ON LAW ENFORCEMENT. I DON'T SEE ANYTHING DEALING WITH JUVENILE JUSTICE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IS THAT MISSING OFF OF THIS INFORMATION. ROB FIGHT WILL JUST GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND- AND I APOLOGIZE THAT IT WASN'T INCLUDED SO I AM BOTH. AT ESTABLISHED AND CO AT ESTABLISHED OUR BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ON JAIL REFORM IN OUR COMMUNITY AND WE- CAME UP WITH SIX HUNDRED RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE OUR JAIL WHERE 58% THROUGH THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. I ESTABLISHED- ARE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS THEM ALL AND OUR COMMUNITY. I AM THE CO CHAIR AND ESTABLISHED HUMAN TRAFFICKING I COMMISSION AND ALSO JUST RECENTLY ESTABLISHED ABOUT A YEAR AGO OUR CHILD ADVOCACY CENTER COMMUNITY. SO MY BACKGROUND RELATES TO MY SERVICE AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL PLAYING A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN PUBLIC SAFETY OF BOTH OF THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND- AS A MEMBER OF THE STATE AS A CITY COUNCIL I WORKED. VERY HARD- TO ADDRESS MEGAN'S LAW SO WE DIDN'T HAVE. FRANKLY PEOPLE MOVING INTO COMMUNITIES WITHOUT THE COMMUNITY KNOWING FOR THIS MOVIE YEAH- SO MY BACKGROUND IS REALLY THAT AND THE LIKE TO FISHEL- PLAYING A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN PUBLIC SAFETY I SHOULD JUST HAVE ONE OTHER THING THAT IS OF. SOMETHING I'M- ABOUT HERE IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY. WE PROCESS- RATE GETS I THINK FASTER THAN ANY OTHER COUNTY IN THE COUNTRY. WE DON'T HAVE A BACKLOG- INCLUDING BEING ABLE TO DO THAT FOR STRANGERS UNDER FIVE DAYS. AND WE'RE ABOUT IT FIFTEEN DAYS FOR ALL OTHER CATS. THANK YOU I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S AND THAT'S A GOOD A- GOOD THING TO KNOW. I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH- IN THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME ASK THOSE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SENATOR GROWTH. ARMS WELL THIS IS BEEN A FAIRLY. EXTENSIVE AND ROBUST. CONVERSATION AMONGST ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES- AND I THINK A LOT OF GROUND HAS BEEN COVERED IDEA. YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT THE RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONNAIRES- FIRST AND FOREMOST I THINK I'M I REALLY NEED TO THANK EACH OF YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND YOUR COMMITMENT BECAUSE- THIS IS NOT EASY WORK OBVIOUSLY EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE THAT EACH YOU BRING TO THIS. THIS BODY OUR TO DO THE WORK. AND IT HAS BECOME CLEAR TO ME THROUGH THE CONVERSATION THAT. YOU KNOW THERE ARE GRAY AREAS BETWEEN THE INNER SEXUALITY OR THAT THE INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF WHAT THE ROLE OF THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IS. AS OF ONE ONE OF YOU THINK CHIEF MILLS MAYBE IT WAS YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED. HAYNES MENTIONED AB ONE OH NINE AND THE- THE WORK AROUND THAT AND I REMEMBER MY COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERMICRO THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS MEMBER SAYING TO ME ALONG WITH OUR SHERIFF AT THAT TIME. YOU KNOW WE CAN DO THIS BUT YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE RESOURCES- AND A COUPLE OF YOU'VE MENTIONED THAT SEVERAL TIMES IN DIFFERENT. DIFFERENT WAYS FOR DIFFERENT DIFFERENT REASONS- IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS- WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE HAVE CERTAINLY NOT ENOUGH FACILITIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR. THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE DRUG AND ALCOHOL ADDICTIONS. I EAT FENNEL OBVIOUSLY WE TALKA LOT ABOUT THAT. TODAY. MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ALL OF THOSE THINGS- AS WE TRY TO LOOK AT HOW WE ADDRESS AND DEAL WITH THOSE WHO ARE INCARCERATED- AND THE VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF FOLKS. I'M COMING BACK BECAUSE- IT WAS FOR THE QUESTIONS AROUND SAN DIEGO WHEN WE GOT THE AUDIT REPORT- THAT REFERENCED MAY BE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PSEC VERSES- WHAT A COUNTY SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR AND IT'S CLEAR WE HAVE SOME WORK TO DO IN THIS AREA. BECAUSE I THINK THE LINES OF RESPONSIBILITY DELINEATION WHETHER YOU HAVE ACTUAL AUTHORITY IN THE ROLE HERE AT THIS BOARD OF BECAME. A LITTLE MORE IN CENTER FOCUS IF YOU WILL WHICH IS WHY YOU GOT THE QUESTIONS ABOUT SAN DIEGO I KNOW THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT L. A. N. AND OTHERS BUT THERE WAS- QUITE A LONG PERIOD OF TIME AND EXTENSIVE MEDIA ACCOUNTS OF WHAT WAS GOING ON IN SAN DIEGO AND THOSE OF US REPRESENT THE AREA. MERCEDES BENZ WITH PEOPLE BEFORE ALL BEFORE THAT AUDIT OCCURRED- AND SO I THINK THERE'S STILL WORK TO DO THERE I KNOW IN YOUR RESPONSES. THIS IS COMING UP FOR A MEETING IN APRIL- AND I AND I DO THINK THERE'S BEEN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHETHER AND THE QUESTION ASK ARE ALSO. I DO YOU THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE MORE AUTHORITY WHAT SHOULD IT BE SHOULD THERE BE ENFORCEMENT I KNOW CHIEF MILLS YOU GET ASKED THAT QUESTION AT LEAST TWICE WE APOLOGIZE FOR THAT- BUT- I THINK THERE THERE IS GOING TO BE WORK THAT COMES OUT OF THIS AUDIT. AND OTHERS THAT MAY- MEAN THAT THERE WILL BE LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION FOR. THIS BODY TO TAKE ON MORE OF A ROLE AND I WOULD JUST. I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION OF THE RIGHT NOW EXCEPT MAYBE THAT YOU KEEP AN OPEN MIND AS YOU HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS. ARE AT UPCOMING BOARDS BECAUSE SOMETHING IS NOT WORKING- YOU KNOW I IT'S HARD TO REPRESENT A COMMUNITY FOR YOUR JAIL. OF WHO HUNDRED EIGHTY DEATHS. IN A PERIOD OF TIME- AND THAT SOMEHOW BETWEEN THE INSPECTIONS. AND THE ANALYSIS OF TRAINING OF STAFF- WE SOMEHOW. MISSED AN ABILITY AND I HAVE TO SAY COLLECTIVELY- MISSED AN ABILITY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO THERE. AND YOU ARE EXPERTS IN YOUR VARIOUS FIELDS AND YOU SERVE FOR A PURPOSE AND THERE ARE GOOD PEOPLE THAT WORK IN THE JAILS AND THERE ARE GOOD INTENTIONS BUT SOMETHING DID NOT GO. WELL AT ALL FOR THIS TO HAPPEN. AND A PART OF IT IS JAIL SHOULD NOT BE FACILITIES THAT ARE. HAVING TO DEAL WITH ALL OF THE MEDICAL NEEDS BUT SOMEHOW. IT BECAUSE THEY HAVE BECOME THAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT RESOURCES NEED TO BE THERE. TO PROTECT. THOSE WHO WERE INCARCERATED- IN TO SUPPORT THE STAFF THAT WORK THERE SO I'M JUST GONNA NOT BARRAGED WITH QUESTIONS BECAUSE I THINK THE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ASKED BUT ASK YOU TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND. AND BE PREPARED TO GIVE US FEEDBACK ON WHAT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO DO A WHOSE ROLE IS IT. SHOULD BE A C. C. B. TAPPED LEGISLATIVELY TO TAKE ON MORE OF A ROLE TO GIVE YOUR FEEDBACK ON THAT AND MAYBE NOT JUST SIMPLY SAY NO WE DON'T SUPPORT THAT OR GIVE US THE FEEDBACK AND SO I WOULD JUST ASK A SIMPLE QUESTION IS OF EACH OF YOU ARE YOU WILLING TO WORK WITH US TO RESOLVE SOME OF THESE OBVIOUSLY GAPS. THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED- AND HELP US UNDERSTAND WHOSE ROLE IS IT BECAUSE I BE HONEST WITH YOU I HAD I HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THEY FELT LIKE IT WAS NOT THEIR ROLE- IN IN MANY IN CERTAIN WAYS I DON'T WANNA. I DON'T AND YOU TO BE CAREFUL HOW I SAY THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE ENGAGED IN A CONVERSATION BUT- ALSO I THINK PART OF IT RECOGNIZING THE ROLE OF AN ELECTED SHERIFF. I WAS A PIECE OF THAT CONVERSATION SO SOMEHOW WE'VE GOT TO BRING THESE. CONVERSATIONS MORE ALIGNED AND HAVE A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE PARTIES TO GET. AT HOW WE'RE GONNA. HAVE WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS AND I KNOW THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES FOR LA. IN TERMS OF THE FACILITIES AND NOT JUST A LIE BUT A FEW OTHERS. BUT WE REALLY NEED TO BE TALKING MORE ABOUT HOW BEST TO THAT AND YOU ARE THE EXPERTS- YOU ARE THE EXPERTS AT THIS WHICH IS WHY YOU'VE BEEN TAX. TAPPED TO BE ON THIS. ON THIS BOARD SO- I WOULD JUST THEN QUICKLY ASK OUR SUPERVISOR CHÁVEZ. WILL YOU GIVE SOME REFLECTION ON THIS AND GIVE SOME THOUGHT IN CASE WE WANT TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU AFTER TODAY AND ASK. YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW WE COULD DO THIS BETTER AND MAYBE AFTER YOU SIT THROUGH THE AUDIT. FROM SAN DIEGO YOU MIGHT HAVE MORE TO SHARE WITH WITH MY STAFF AN HONOR TO GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT WITH YOUR TEAM. I APPRECIATE THAT CHIEF MILLS- CAN I ASK THE SAME CONSIDERATION OF YOU AT THIS POINT. MADAM CHAIR ABSOLUTELY WOULD BE WILLING TO BE OPEN MINDED- ASKED AS PENETRATING QUESTIONS AS WE CAN I GIVEN THE INFORMATION WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE. THE BEST PATH FORWARD WITH YOUR STAFF. CHIEF THANK YOU AND CHIEF PAINS I'M NOT GONNA LEAVE YOU OUT OF THIS CONVERSATION AND SO WOULD ASK THE SAME OF YOU. ABSOLUTELY KNOWLEDGE HERE IF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT I CAN DO I AM WILLING TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF TO WAS. KNOWN BOTH THROUGH THE ARTICLE THAT I TO CALL ME TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME INPUT- I KNOW. WE CERTAINLY CAN BE HELPFUL FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDERS. WHO WE ARE WITH. THANK EACH OF YOU AND TO THE CHIEFS AND THE SUPERVISOR- I HAVE THE BOARD LIST HERE SO DON'T WORRY WE WON'T JUST PUT YOU ON THE SPOT BECAUSE YOU'RE UP FOR REAPPOINTMENT- APPOINTMENT CONFIRMATIONS.
