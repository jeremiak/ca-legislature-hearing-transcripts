00:28:08.053 --> 00:28:09.687
OVER A MILLION STUDENTS

00:28:09.754 --> 00:28:11.056
WORLDWIDE WALKED OUT OF THEIR

00:28:11.122 --> 00:28:13.091
SCHOOLS IN PROTEST. WITH THIS

00:28:13.158 --> 00:28:14.359
MUCH ACTIVISM COMING FROM THE

00:28:14.426 --> 00:28:16.628
YOUTH ONE WOULD THINK THAT IT

00:28:16.694 --> 00:28:17.295
WOULD BE REFLECTED IN THE

00:28:17.362 --> 00:28:19.564
SCHOOLS. BUT CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS

00:28:19.631 --> 00:28:21.866
ARE DOING LITTLE TO PROMOTE OR

00:28:21.933 --> 00:28:22.300
ENSURE ENVIRONMENTAL

00:28:22.367 --> 00:28:25.637
SUSTAINABILITY. AS A RESULT IN

00:28:25.703 --> 00:28:27.639
CALIFORNIA WE'VE EXPERIENCED

00:28:27.705 --> 00:28:28.440
THE EFFECTS OF THE CLIMATE

00:28:28.506 --> 00:28:30.508
CRISIS FIRSTHAND DROUGHT TO

00:28:30.575 --> 00:28:31.776
MADE WATER CONSERVATION MORE

00:28:31.843 --> 00:28:34.179
VITAL THAN EVER. AND WILD FIRES

00:28:34.245 --> 00:28:35.814
HAVE SWEPT ACROSS OUR STATE

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.316
CAUSING IMMEASURABLE DAMAGE. TO

00:28:38.383 --> 00:28:41.820
HOMES BUSINESSES AND FAMILIES.

00:28:41.886 --> 00:28:43.655
I MYSELF HAVE BEEN EVACUATED

00:28:43.721 --> 00:28:46.958
BECAUSE OF THE FIRES. AND IT'S

00:28:47.025 --> 00:28:47.559
A SCARY FEELING NOT KNOWING IF

00:28:47.625 --> 00:28:50.128
I CAN COME HOME. MY SCHOOL IS

00:28:50.195 --> 00:28:52.363
ALSO BEEN SHUT DOWN FOR DAYS AT

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:55.266
A TIME. DUE TO POOR AIR QUALITY.

00:28:55.333 --> 00:28:56.468
BECAUSE DURING THE FIRE SEASON

00:28:56.534 --> 00:28:58.536
WHEN THE GRASS IS DRY AND THE

00:28:58.603 --> 00:29:01.139
WINDS ARE UNUSUALLY STRONG. I

00:29:01.206 --> 00:29:03.842
LIVE IN FEAR. MY FAMILY LIVES

00:29:03.908 --> 00:29:06.711
IN FEAR. MY FRIENDS WHO HAVE

00:29:06.778 --> 00:29:07.312
ALREADY LOST THEIR HOMES LIVE

00:29:07.378 --> 00:29:10.815
IN FEAR. BUT I REFUSED TO LET

00:29:10.882 --> 00:29:13.518
THIS CONTINUE SO I'M HERE. I'M

00:29:13.585 --> 00:29:15.253
FIGHTING FOR CHANGE. OUR

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.421
PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE

00:29:16.488 --> 00:29:19.324
CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS FUNDING TO

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:19.891
ADDRESS THIS CLIMATE CRISIS

00:29:19.958 --> 00:29:22.293
THROUGH THE EXISTING FUNDS.

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:23.161

TO THE MODERNIZATION AND

00:29:30.335 --> 00:29:31.536
CONSTRUCTION OF SCHOOL

00:29:31.603 --> 00:29:34.739
FACILITIES FAST WE PROPOSE THE

00:29:34.806 --> 00:29:35.340
GOVERNING BOARDS OF A SCHOOL

00:29:35.406 --> 00:29:37.308
DISTRICT TO APPLY FOR FUNDING.

00:29:37.375 --> 00:29:38.409

YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE MUST AS

00:29:45.984 --> 00:29:46.951
A PART OF THE SUBSEQUENT

00:29:47.018 --> 00:29:48.853
MODERNIZATIONS OR CONSTRUCTION

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.689
PROJECT INCLUDE LOW FLOW WATER

00:29:51.756 --> 00:29:54.659
AERATORS AND LED LIGHTS. WATER

00:29:54.726 --> 00:29:56.528
AERATORS ARE THE SMALL METAL

00:29:56.594 --> 00:29:58.062
PARTS PLACED ON THE END OF

00:29:58.129 --> 00:29:59.230
FAUCETS THAT LOOK LIKE MESH

00:29:59.297 --> 00:30:02.100
SCREENS WATER AERATORS BREAK UP

00:30:02.167 --> 00:30:03.835
THE FLOW OF WATER INTO MULTIPLE

00:30:03.902 --> 00:30:05.803
SMALL STREAMS ADDING AIR IN

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:06.671
BETWEEN WHICH ULTIMATELY

00:30:06.738 --> 00:30:09.941
REDUCES WATER USAGE WITHOUT

00:30:10.008 --> 00:30:10.508
ACTUALLY AFFECTING THE WATER

00:30:10.575 --> 00:30:13.678
SURE. CURRENTLY THE MAJORITY OF

00:30:13.745 --> 00:30:14.812
FAUCETS CONTAIN AERATORS IS TWO

00:30:14.879 --> 00:30:16.047
POINT TWO GALLONS OF WATER PER

00:30:16.114 --> 00:30:17.782
MINUTE. LOW FLOW WATER AIRDATE

00:30:17.849 --> 00:30:19.284
AERATORS WOULD BE THOSE

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:21.252
CHARACTERIZED. AS THE ONES THAT

00:30:21.319 --> 00:30:24.656
ONLY USE ABOUT POINT FIVE TWO

00:30:24.722 --> 00:30:25.223
ONE GALLONS GALLONS OF WATER

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:28.459
PER MINUTE. THESE TOOLS ARE

00:30:28.526 --> 00:30:30.094
BOTH BENEFICIAL AND LOW COST AS

00:30:30.161 --> 00:30:31.996
THE AVERAGE AERATOR IS ONLY ONE

00:30:32.063 --> 00:30:33.865
DOLLAR ACCORDING TO THE HOME

00:30:33.932 --> 00:30:35.700
WATER WORKS ORGANIZATION.

00:30:35.767 --> 00:30:37.402
ADDITIONALLY THE IMPLEMENTATION

00:30:37.468 --> 00:30:39.170
OF LED LIGHTS IS ANOTHER

00:30:39.237 --> 00:30:41.639
SIGNIFICANT BUT RELATIVELY LOW

00:30:41.706 --> 00:30:44.943
COST SUSTAINABILITY PROJECT.

00:30:45.009 --> 00:30:48.146
LED LIGHTS YOU 75% LESS ENERGY

00:30:48.213 --> 00:30:49.681
AND THEY LASTS TWENTY FIVE

00:30:49.747 --> 00:30:51.049
TIMES LONGER THAN TRADITIONAL

00:30:51.115 --> 00:30:54.219
FLUORESCENT BULBS. WHILE THE

00:30:54.285 --> 00:30:56.087
INITIAL COST OF INSTALLING LED

00:30:56.154 --> 00:30:57.388
LIGHTS IS RELATIVELY

00:30:57.455 --> 00:30:59.591
SUBSTANTIAL IT IS A SIZEABLE

00:30:59.657 --> 00:31:01.593
LONG TERM INVESTMENT. THIS

00:31:01.659 --> 00:31:03.795
PROPOSAL IS A DIRECT PATH FOR

00:31:03.861 --> 00:31:05.730
CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS TO INCREASE

00:31:05.797 --> 00:31:06.831
THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN COMBATING

00:31:06.898 --> 00:31:08.766
THE CLIMATE CRISIS WITHOUT

00:31:08.833 --> 00:31:11.236
DEMANDING ANY NEW FUNDING

00:31:11.302 --> 00:31:13.571
PROGRAMS. ADDITIONALLY THIS

00:31:13.638 --> 00:31:14.706
LEGISLATIVE APPROACH TO THE

00:31:14.772 --> 00:31:16.441

ALLOCATION BOARDS FUNDING

00:31:17.942 --> 00:31:21.246
GUIDELINES IS NOT UNPRECEDENTED.

00:31:21.312 --> 00:31:23.047
THIS PROPOSAL WAS BASED IN PART

00:31:23.114 --> 00:31:26.184
ON ASSEMBLY BILL THREE TWO ZERO

00:31:26.251 --> 00:31:26.718

CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL AUTHORIZED

00:31:45.703 --> 00:31:48.039
BUT DID NOT REQUIRE THE USE OF

00:31:48.106 --> 00:31:49.641
MODERNIZATION AND CONSTRUCTION

00:31:49.707 --> 00:31:52.477
FOR. ON OURS ALTERNATIVE SCHOOL

00:31:52.543 --> 00:31:53.978
SAFETY PROJECTS. BOTH SEEKING

00:31:54.045 --> 00:31:55.413
FUNDING OPTIONS FOR THESE

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.048
ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY

00:31:57.115 --> 00:31:58.750
PROJECTS WE HAVE BEEN LIMITED

00:31:58.816 --> 00:31:59.917
IN BUILDING A PATH TO

00:31:59.984 --> 00:32:01.919
COMPREHENSIVE CLIMATE ACTION

00:32:01.986 --> 00:32:03.054
AND IMPLEMENTING CLIMATE

00:32:03.121 --> 00:32:05.523
JUSTICE OUR PROPOSAL IS A STEP

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:06.824
TOWARDS MEETING THESE GOALS I'M

00:32:06.891 --> 00:32:08.092
ALL TOO MANY CREATE IMMEDIATE

00:32:08.159 --> 00:32:09.961
AND FORESEEABLE RESULTS. BUT IT

00:32:10.028 --> 00:32:12.730
IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH TO ADDRESS

00:32:12.797 --> 00:32:13.931
AND RESOLVE THE EXTENSIVE

00:32:13.998 --> 00:32:15.967
AFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE SB

00:32:16.034 --> 00:32:17.168
FORMULATED THE OUTLINE FOR A

00:32:17.235 --> 00:32:18.770
PROPOSAL WE FIRST DEVELOPED A

00:32:18.836 --> 00:32:19.837
STRATEGY TO LEGISLATIVE THE

00:32:19.904 --> 00:32:21.172
MANDATE FUNDING FOR

00:32:21.239 --> 00:32:22.373
ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.409
PROJECTS. HOWEVER IT CAME TO

00:32:24.475 --> 00:32:26.244
OUR ATTENTION THAT THE STATE

00:32:26.311 --> 00:32:28.313
COULD NOT DIRECTLY IMPORTS

00:32:28.379 --> 00:32:29.547
FUNDING RESTRICTIONS ON THE

00:32:29.614 --> 00:32:30.648
SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN OUR STATE.

00:32:30.715 --> 00:32:32.016
THEN WE LOOKING TO AMENDING THE

00:32:32.083 --> 00:32:32.750
LOCAL CONTROL AND

00:32:32.817 --> 00:32:35.586
ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN BUT WE

00:32:35.653 --> 00:32:37.388
REALIZE THAT IT IS EXTREMELY

00:32:37.455 --> 00:32:38.690
DIFFICULT TO CHANGE ITS CURRENT

00:32:38.756 --> 00:32:39.757
FORMATTING ALSO WE WERE

00:32:39.824 --> 00:32:41.626
INFORMED OF THE ORGANIZATION

00:32:41.693 --> 00:32:42.493

THE INCREMENTAL CHANGE IS NOT

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:03.681
FEASIBLE IN SUBSTANTIALLY

00:33:03.748 --> 00:33:04.749
DIMINISHING THE DRASTIC

00:33:04.816 --> 00:33:06.250
CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE.

TWENTY THIRTY. IF WE DO NOT DO

00:33:17.261 --> 00:33:19.364
EVERYTHING TO REVERSE THE

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:20.531
REPERCUSSIONS WE WILL REST

REACTIONS BEYOND HUMAN CONTROL.

00:33:24.602 --> 00:33:27.105
AS HUMANS WE MUST SECURE OUR

00:33:27.171 --> 00:33:31.576
SURVIVAL. AND ITS PERFORMANCE

00:33:31.642 --> 00:33:37.548
WE MUST TAKE THE NECESSARY. UPS

00:33:37.615 --> 00:33:40.084
FORCED INTO THE DIRECTION OUR

00:33:40.151 --> 00:33:40.918
PROPOSAL IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT

THEIR SUSTAINABILITY EFFORTS

00:33:42.553 --> 00:33:43.388
BUT IT IS STILL NOT ENOUGH TO

00:33:43.454 --> 00:33:44.222
FULLY RESOLVE THE CLIMATE

00:33:44.288 --> 00:33:45.957
CRISIS WE AS YOUTH WHO HAVE TO

HERE TALK ABOUT THE STATE

00:34:17.321 --> 00:34:19.290
ALLOCATION BOARD BECAUSE I

00:34:19.357 --> 00:34:20.258
IMAGINE YOU COULD FIND A LOT OF

00:34:20.324 --> 00:34:21.125
LEGISLATORS IN THIS BUILDING

00:34:21.192 --> 00:34:22.226
WHO DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE

00:34:22.293 --> 00:34:24.962
STATE ALLOCATION BORDERS- BUT

00:34:25.029 --> 00:34:25.463
THAT'S A BOARD I SAID ON

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:27.432
ACTUALLY- SO I HAVE A SPECIFIC

00:34:27.498 --> 00:34:29.200
INTEREST IN SCHOOL FACILITIES

00:34:29.267 --> 00:34:32.403
HAVING BEEN A HIGH SCHOOL

00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.937
TEACHER FOR A LONG TIME IN

00:34:33.004 --> 00:34:36.741
MIDDLE SCHOOL. I SAID SO YOU'RE

00:34:36.808 --> 00:34:37.375
ASKING FOR MONEY FROM THE STATE

00:34:37.442 --> 00:34:39.677
ALLOCATION WAS THAT CORRECT.

00:34:39.744 --> 00:34:40.545
I'M WHAT WE'RE ASKING TO DO IS

00:34:40.611 --> 00:34:43.414
THAT- WHEN PEOPLE RECEIVE THE

00:34:43.481 --> 00:34:45.216
GRANT FROM THE STATE ALLOCATION

00:34:45.283 --> 00:34:47.385

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.602
THE TO SUSTAINABILITY PROJECTS

00:35:04.669 --> 00:35:08.539

GREAT PRESENTATION- IT SOUNDS

00:35:19.917 --> 00:35:23.287
TOO GOOD. FOR YOU KNOW NOBODY

00:35:23.354 --> 00:35:27.024
TO OBJECT TO. WHAT WOULD YOU

00:35:27.091 --> 00:35:28.593
SAY IS YOUR OPPOSITION'S

00:35:28.659 --> 00:35:29.994
STRONGEST ARGUMENT WHAT SHOULD

00:35:30.061 --> 00:35:35.500
WE BE READY FOR. THAT COULD BE.

00:35:35.566 --> 00:35:37.502
VOICE TO YOU AND SAY NO WE

00:35:37.568 --> 00:35:39.370

00:35:39.437 --> 00:35:40.872
WHAT'S THE STRONGEST OPPOSITION

00:35:40.938 --> 00:35:43.941
ARGUMENT ON THE QUESTION IT

00:35:44.008 --> 00:35:46.811
COULD BE THAT- POTENTIALLY MOST

00:35:46.878 --> 00:35:48.479
DISTRICTS WOULD SEEK MORE GRANT

00:35:48.546 --> 00:35:49.947
MONEY AND SO THEY WOULD

00:35:50.014 --> 00:35:52.283
EVENTUALLY HAVE TO THEY WOULD

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:53.784
EVENTUALLY HAVE TO EVERY

00:35:53.851 --> 00:35:54.819

00:35:54.886 --> 00:35:56.254
TO ASK FOR MORE GRANT MONEY AND

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.088
EVENTUALLY THERE WOULDN'T BE

00:35:57.154 --> 00:35:59.457
ENOUGH FOR MORE SCHOOLS TO

00:35:59.524 --> 00:36:00.758
RECEIVE MONEY SO IT WOULD BE. A

00:36:00.825 --> 00:36:01.993
LITTLE LESS DIFFERENT IT WOULD

00:36:02.059 --> 00:36:02.994
BE MORE DIFFICULT TO GIVE

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:04.595
EVERYONE GRANT MONEY I'M NOT

00:36:04.662 --> 00:36:05.363

00:36:05.429 --> 00:36:06.764
QUESTION AS WELL BUT I'VE

00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:08.266

THAT- THAT IS ONE OF THINGS I

00:36:40.831 --> 00:36:41.299

00:41:40.431 --> 00:41:42.533
CONSENSUS. STUDENTS RUN AROUND

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:44.168
IN CHAOS UNABLE TO DECIDE WHICH

00:41:44.235 --> 00:41:45.169
SET OF INSTRUCTIONS FOLLOW

00:41:45.236 --> 00:41:48.105
EVACUATE BECAUSE THE ALARM OR-

00:41:48.172 --> 00:41:48.706
LOCK DOWN BECAUSE OF A SCHOOL

00:41:48.772 --> 00:41:52.209
THREAT. THIS TRAGEDY SHOWS AN

00:41:52.276 --> 00:41:53.978
INHERENT ISSUE IN OUR EDUCATION

00:41:54.044 --> 00:41:54.745
SYSTEM AND OUR REACTION-

00:41:54.812 --> 00:41:56.513
PROCEDURES WITH FELL TO CONFIRM

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:58.949
ALERTS OR ALARMS BEFORE WE ACT.

00:41:59.016 --> 00:41:59.550
THE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES OUR

00:41:59.617 --> 00:42:02.152
EFFICIENCY AND AGGRAVATE THE

00:42:02.219 --> 00:42:02.720
FEAR AND TENSION INHERENT IN

00:42:02.786 --> 00:42:05.055
OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM.

00:42:05.122 --> 00:42:05.990
HOW MANY STUDENTS DO YOU THINK

00:42:06.056 --> 00:42:07.491
WOULD STILL BE ALIVE TODAY IF

00:42:07.558 --> 00:42:08.058
WE DIDN'T MATTER IMMEDIATELY

00:42:08.125 --> 00:42:10.895
EVACUATE. WE UNDERSTAND THAT

00:42:10.961 --> 00:42:12.196
THE THREAT OF SCHOOL SHOOTINGS

00:42:12.263 --> 00:42:13.297
DOES NOT AFFECT EVERY SIN IN

00:42:13.364 --> 00:42:15.432
CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER WAS SCHOOLS

00:42:15.499 --> 00:42:16.433
BECOMING THE MOST COMMON

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:19.403
LOCATION WORK ACTIVE SHOOTINGS

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:20.638
OCCUR IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO

00:42:20.704 --> 00:42:21.672
UP THE PERSON MERGING SEE

00:42:21.739 --> 00:42:24.208
PROTOCOLS WE HAVE IN PLACE. THE

00:42:24.275 --> 00:42:25.843
PARKLAND SHOOTING HIGHLIGHTS

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:26.644
ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:29.246
EMERGENCY SITUATIONS. A FIRE

00:42:29.313 --> 00:42:29.780
ALARM LOWER THE STUDENTS

00:42:29.847 --> 00:42:31.615
OUTSIDE OF THE SAFETY OF THEIR

00:42:31.682 --> 00:42:33.984
CLASSROOM. THE PROBLEMS CLEAR

00:42:34.051 --> 00:42:36.053
WE'RE NOT YEAH EQUIPPED TO

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.354
CONSIDER EVERY DANGER AND AS

00:42:37.421 --> 00:42:39.657
WE'VE SEEN THIS INSUFFICIENCY

00:42:39.723 --> 00:42:41.792
HAS TAKEN FAR TOO MANY LIVES.

00:42:41.859 --> 00:42:42.660
WHEN APPROACHING THIS ISSUE WE

00:42:42.726 --> 00:42:43.961
BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT SCHOOLS

00:42:44.028 --> 00:42:45.362
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA VERY

00:42:45.429 --> 00:42:47.364
GREATLY FROM ACCESSIBILITY TO

00:42:47.431 --> 00:42:49.166
ACCESSIBILITY TO EMERGENCY

00:42:50.601 --> 00:42:52.836
LIMITATIONS. THEREFORE THIS IS

00:42:52.903 --> 00:42:53.904
NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL

00:42:53.971 --> 00:42:56.573
SOLUTION. RATHER IT IS A

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:57.174
CONVERSATION THAT NEEDS TO BE

00:42:57.241 --> 00:43:00.811
HELD LOCALLY. ALL DISTRICTS

00:43:00.878 --> 00:43:01.345
SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:43:01.412 --> 00:43:02.279
ADDRESSING THESE CONCERNS WHAT

00:43:02.346 --> 00:43:04.014
THE RISING FREQUENCY OF ACTIVE

00:43:04.081 --> 00:43:04.548
SHOOTER THREATS WE NEED TO

00:43:04.615 --> 00:43:06.417
REFORM THE SYSTEM NOW.

00:43:06.483 --> 00:43:07.918
CURRENTLY IMMEDIATE ACTUATION

00:43:07.985 --> 00:43:09.553
IS THE MOST COMMON RESPONSE TO

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:12.690
A FIRE ALARM HOWEVER THIS DOES

00:43:12.756 --> 00:43:14.725
EVACUATION CAN BE USED AS A

00:43:14.792 --> 00:43:15.326
TOOL BY ACTIVE SHOOTERS FULLER

00:43:15.392 --> 00:43:17.361
STUDENTS OUT OF THE CLASSROOM.

00:43:17.428 --> 00:43:18.896
THUS WE PROPOSE THAT UNDER

00:43:18.963 --> 00:43:20.998
EDUCATION CODE THREE TWO TWO

00:43:21.065 --> 00:43:21.966
EIGHT TWO. DISTRICTS ARE

00:43:22.032 --> 00:43:23.100
REQUIRED TO CREATE A SAFETY

PROCEDURE PLAN IN THE INSTANCE

00:43:24.735 --> 00:43:26.637

THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES. THEY CAN

00:43:34.178 --> 00:43:34.912
TAILOR THE BEST SOLUTIONS

00:43:34.979 --> 00:43:37.281
POSSIBLE. FOR INSTANCE A FIRE

00:43:37.348 --> 00:43:38.649
PRONE AREA WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO

POSTPONE EVACUATION WHEREAS IT

00:43:41.485 --> 00:43:43.887
WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR AN AREA

WITH MORE GUN VIOLENCE SUPPOSED

00:43:44.588 --> 00:43:48.092
WHEN EVACUATION. TRAGEDY SUCH

TRAGEDY SUCH AS THE PARK ON

00:43:52.463 --> 00:43:53.297
SHOOTING COULD HAVE BEEN

00:43:53.364 --> 00:43:54.732
MITIGATED OR PREVENTED WITH NEW

00:43:54.798 --> 00:43:56.300
POLICIES FOR EMERGENCY

DISTRICTS ARE CURRENTLY IN

00:44:01.405 --> 00:44:03.273
PRACTICE BY SEVERAL SCHOOLS

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:03.807
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND

EMERGENCY ALARM IS ACTIVATED.

00:44:21.525 --> 00:44:22.860
THIS PROTECTS THE STUDENTS IN

00:44:22.926 --> 00:44:24.995
THE SPECIFIC CASE OF AN ACTIVE

00:44:25.062 --> 00:44:27.164
SHOOTER PULLING THE FIRE ALARM.

00:44:27.231 --> 00:44:28.332
THIS LOCKDOWN PROCEDURE IS A

00:44:28.399 --> 00:44:29.566
GREAT EXAMPLE AS TO HOW

00:44:29.633 --> 00:44:31.068
IMPLEMENTING THE NEW SAFETY

00:44:31.135 --> 00:44:33.070

EMERGENCIES. THIS FURTHER

00:44:36.306 --> 00:44:38.042
PROVES A NECESSITY FOR OUR

00:44:38.108 --> 00:44:39.309
PROPOSAL TO BE APPROVED IN

00:44:39.376 --> 00:44:41.545

STRATEGIES. THIS PROTOCOL IS A

00:44:45.549 --> 00:44:47.317
WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF WHAT OUR

00:44:47.384 --> 00:44:50.120
PROPOSAL WISHES TO ACCOMPLISH

00:44:50.187 --> 00:44:50.721

STANDARD. NO ONE. CAN PUT A

00:44:56.193 --> 00:44:58.829
PRICE ON THE VALUE OF LIFE.

00:44:58.896 --> 00:44:59.797
THIS IS NOT A MATTER OF

00:44:59.863 --> 00:45:01.765

FORCE. A TYPE OF BELL THAT'S

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.369
DIFFERENT THAN A FIRE BELL WITH

00:45:39.436 --> 00:45:40.904
THAT SO WE'RE ASKING FOR

00:45:40.971 --> 00:45:44.374
DISTRICTS TO CREATE A PROTOCOL-

00:45:44.441 --> 00:45:46.877
IN THE SITUATION OF A ACTIVE

00:45:46.944 --> 00:45:48.011
SHOOTER HOLDING THE FIRE ALARM

THE EXAMPLE THAT WE HAVE IS

00:46:51.008 --> 00:46:52.109
THREE SHOTS UNION HIGH SCHOOL

00:46:52.176 --> 00:46:53.977
DISTRICT THE WAY IN WHICH STATE

00:46:54.044 --> 00:46:56.413
RUN THEIR PROTOCOL IS WHEN THE

THAT WELL AS A HUGE PLACE THAT

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.802
IS A REAL BIG PLACE IN THAT

00:47:51.868 --> 00:47:53.604

OFF WERE USED TO RUNNING AWAY.

00:48:08.752 --> 00:48:09.286
THAT'S KIND OF THE POINT OF WE

00:48:09.353 --> 00:48:09.820
WANT SCHOOLS TO DEVELOP A

00:48:09.886 --> 00:48:12.623
SYSTEM- FOR WHEN THE FIRE

00:48:12.689 --> 00:48:14.224
ALARMS PULLED AS IF AN ACTIVE

00:48:14.291 --> 00:48:16.093
SHOOTER WERE TO PULL IT. UP

00:48:16.159 --> 00:48:18.595
BECAUSE YOU WANT THEM TO ASSUME

00:48:18.662 --> 00:48:19.863
AN ACTIVE SHOOTER HAS PULLED

00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:22.232
ATTRACTIVE. YES OR ELSE- YOU

00:48:22.299 --> 00:48:23.100
JUST BE RUNNING OUT OF DANGER

00:48:23.166 --> 00:48:24.835
AND NOT KNOWING IT. SO THIS IS

00:48:24.901 --> 00:48:26.236
LETTING THEM FIGURE OUT OKAY

00:48:26.303 --> 00:48:27.137
DID AN ACTIVE SHOOTER JUST PULL

00:48:27.204 --> 00:48:29.773
THIS ALARM. DO WE RUN OUTSIDE

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:31.875
BECAUSE IT IS A FIRE OR DID AN

00:48:31.942 --> 00:48:32.476
ACTIVE SHOOTER PULLS ALARM SO

00:48:32.542 --> 00:48:33.176
WE'RE GOING TO WALK DOWN.

00:48:33.243 --> 00:48:34.344
THAT'S THE REASON WHY SHASTA

00:48:34.411 --> 00:48:34.978
HIGH SCHOOL HAS A PROCEDURE TO

00:48:35.045 --> 00:48:37.648
IMMEDIATELY GOING TO LOCK DOWN.

00:48:37.714 --> 00:48:40.050
AND THEN INTO EVACUATION. AND

00:48:40.117 --> 00:48:41.551
TO BELIEVE THAT A LOT OF

00:48:41.618 --> 00:48:46.556
SCHOOLS WOULD FOLLOW THAT TYPE

00:48:46.623 --> 00:48:47.891
OF. BALL BUT OF COURSE SB PRINT

00:48:47.958 --> 00:48:54.064
EACH. OF COURSE HE SEES THIS.

00:48:54.131 --> 00:48:56.533
THEY SAID YOU CLASS TO. FIRE

00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.368
YOU KNOW ONE GOING BACK IN. YOU

00:48:58.435 --> 00:49:02.572
ARE THE MANY OTHERS YOU I'M.

00:49:02.639 --> 00:49:03.707
OKAY I'M I'M JUST TRYING TO

00:49:03.774 --> 00:49:04.341
THINK THIS YEAR BECAUSE I GET I

00:49:04.408 --> 00:49:05.342
GET I GET YOUR POINT THAT

00:49:05.409 --> 00:49:06.543
SOMEONE COULD PULL THE FIRE

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:07.177
ALARM STUDENTS HEAD OUT TO THE

00:49:07.244 --> 00:49:08.545
FIELD WITH A TYPICALLY LINE UP

00:49:08.612 --> 00:49:09.546
AND WAVE THE TEACHER COME OUT

00:49:09.613 --> 00:49:10.113
CALL ROLE. RIGHT THAT'S WHAT

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:13.150
THEY DO. YEAH AND HOW DO YOU

00:49:13.216 --> 00:49:13.950
HOW DO YOU. HOW DO YOU RESPOND

00:49:14.017 --> 00:49:14.685
TO THAT DYNAMIC I. THINK THIS

00:49:14.751 --> 00:49:16.153
IS AN INTERESTING. POINT THAT I

00:49:16.219 --> 00:49:16.887
DON'T REALLY I. THOUGHT A LOT

00:49:16.953 --> 00:49:17.621
ABOUT QUITE FRANKLY WHAT I'M

00:49:17.688 --> 00:49:19.156
USED TO HAPPENING. QUITE

00:49:19.222 --> 00:49:21.058
FRANKLY IS IN IN AS IN A LOCK

00:49:21.124 --> 00:49:23.193
DOWN SOMEONE GETTING ON THE PA.

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:26.430
SAYING LOCKDOWN. LOCKDOWN SAY

00:49:26.496 --> 00:49:26.997
FIVE TIMES. THAT WAIT FIVE

00:49:27.064 --> 00:49:28.732
SECONDS AND SAY IT AGAIN. SO

00:49:28.799 --> 00:49:31.001
EVERYBODY AND EVERYBODY HEARS

00:49:31.068 --> 00:49:32.169
AND AROUND THE SCHOOL THEY NEED

00:49:32.235 --> 00:49:32.936
TO REPEAT MULTIPLE TO GET TO

00:49:33.003 --> 00:49:34.538
SAY ONCE. RIGHT NEEDS TO BE

00:49:34.604 --> 00:49:36.506
SAID. AND YOU WILL COME ON

00:49:36.573 --> 00:49:37.674
TEMAS I CONTINUE THE LOCKDOWN.

00:49:37.741 --> 00:49:38.508
YEAH RIGHT SO. ON WHAT WE'RE

00:49:38.575 --> 00:49:39.376
KIND OF AIMING FOR IS THAT. THE

00:49:39.443 --> 00:49:40.344
SCHOOLDISTRICTS CAN DECIDE.

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:41.578
HOW THEY WANT TO IMPLEMENTED.

00:49:41.645 --> 00:49:44.081
SO IF THEY WANTED TO IMPLEMENT.

00:49:44.147 --> 00:49:45.148
THAT IT. IS AN IMMEDIATE

00:49:45.215 --> 00:49:47.417
EVACUATION. IT COULD BE AN

00:49:47.484 --> 00:49:49.353
IMMEDIATE EVACUATION. OR IT

00:49:49.419 --> 00:49:50.620
COULD BE. IMMEDIATE LOCKDOWN

00:49:50.687 --> 00:49:51.955
OR- WHATEVER. HAPPY MEDIUM.

00:49:52.022 --> 00:49:52.789
SIZED BASICALLY WHAT YOU WANT

00:49:52.856 --> 00:49:54.291
TO SCHOOL DISTRICT TO DO. A

00:49:54.358 --> 00:49:56.993
SCHOOL BOARD. IS AND THIS WE DO

00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:57.594

LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD. RIGHT AND

00:50:01.965 --> 00:50:03.467
THERE'S A WHAT A THOUSAND

00:50:03.533 --> 00:50:04.334
SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE STATE

00:50:04.401 --> 00:50:05.135
OF CALIFORNIA TEN THOUSAND

00:50:05.202 --> 00:50:07.537
SCHOOLS A LOT OF THEM. AND

00:50:07.604 --> 00:50:09.106
THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT. IN

00:50:09.172 --> 00:50:10.774
GEOGRAPHY. AT SOME. DIFFERENT

00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:11.541
PLACES. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO

00:50:11.608 --> 00:50:14.244
DO IT THIS WAY WE HAVE SAY YOU.

00:50:14.311 --> 00:50:16.980
ADOPT A POLICY. THAT WORKS. FOR

00:50:17.047 --> 00:50:18.648
YOU. EVEN SCHOOLS ARE.

00:50:18.715 --> 00:50:20.050
DEFINITELY SOME THE STUDENTS

00:50:20.117 --> 00:50:25.956
ARE ALL PRETTY MUCH INSIDE SOME.

00:50:26.022 --> 00:50:26.523
THEY'RE ALL OUTSIDE. SO SOME

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:29.960
YOU HAVE TO CROSS STREET. SO I

00:50:30.026 --> 00:50:30.861

ARE. A DIVERSE STATE. IN

00:50:34.731 --> 00:50:35.832
GEOGRAPHY AND THAT WE SHOULD

00:50:35.899 --> 00:50:39.403
HANSEL LOCALS. TO DEVELOP THEIR

00:50:39.469 --> 00:50:40.737
POLICY BUT THAT THEY SHOULD DO

00:50:40.804 --> 00:50:41.304
BALLOT SUCH A POLICY SO THAT

00:50:41.371 --> 00:50:44.608
SENATOR. IS WHERE YOU CAN ADD

00:50:44.674 --> 00:50:46.676

OUR POINT HERE IS TO EMPHASIZE

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:50.614
IN THAT SECTION OF THE

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:51.615
EDUCATION CODE SECTION TO DO A

00:50:51.681 --> 00:50:54.384
TO. THAT SECTION EMPHASIZES THE

00:50:54.451 --> 00:50:55.886
WHAT STUDENTS HAVE TO BE

00:50:55.952 --> 00:50:56.820
PREPARED FOR LIKE FIRES OR YOU

00:50:56.887 --> 00:50:59.790

SAYING WHAT YOU NEED TO DO WE

00:51:01.691 --> 00:51:02.459
JUST NEED THEM TO BE AWARE OF

00:51:02.526 --> 00:51:04.661
THE ABILITY OF THIS AND THAT.

00:51:04.728 --> 00:51:07.831
AND BE PREPARED NOT EARLY. SAY

THIS. ISSUE TO BE INCLUDED

00:51:16.673 --> 00:51:18.875
WHICH I THINK IS VERY. VERY

00:51:18.942 --> 00:51:20.076
GOOD OF YOU TO BRING THAT TO

00:51:20.143 --> 00:51:23.713
OUR ATTENTION- YOU MENTIONED-

00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:25.348
AGAIN JUST IN MAKING THE CASE

00:51:25.415 --> 00:51:27.551
THAT THEY WERE- IN THE FIRST

00:51:27.617 --> 00:51:29.686
FORTY SIX WEEKS OF TWENTY

00:51:29.753 --> 00:51:30.754
NINETEEN FORTY FIVE SHOOTINGS.

00:51:30.821 --> 00:51:32.022
AND AT LEAST ONE SCHOOL

00:51:32.088 --> 00:51:34.958
SHOOTING PER PER WEEK- BUT YOU

ONLY MENTIONED- PARKLAND AS AN

00:51:38.829 --> 00:51:42.766
INCIDENT OF. YOU SAY ON IT THIS

00:51:42.833 --> 00:51:43.867
INCIDENT DEMONSTRATES THAT FIRE

00:51:43.934 --> 00:51:46.369
ALARM IS A COMMON WAY. FOR

00:51:46.436 --> 00:51:47.737
ACTIVE SHOOTERS TO TARGET

00:51:47.804 --> 00:51:51.208
STUDENTS. OF IS THAT REALLY

00:51:51.274 --> 00:51:54.845
WHAT YOUR INFORMATION FOUND I

OR YOU DIDN'T IT IS SORT OF

00:51:55.479 --> 00:51:58.548
MATCH UP. THAT PART WITH THE

00:51:58.615 --> 00:52:03.053
FIRST SET OF FACTS OR

00:52:03.119 --> 00:52:04.688
INFORMATION SO WHAT WE KIND OF

00:52:04.754 --> 00:52:06.323
FOUND WAS THAT PARKLAND

00:52:06.389 --> 00:52:09.860
SHOOTING WAS REALLY A- IT'S

00:52:09.926 --> 00:52:12.362
BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED COMPARED

00:52:12.429 --> 00:52:14.264
TO MANY OTHERS HAVE JUST BEEN

00:52:14.331 --> 00:52:15.131
SAID THERE WAS A SCHOOL

00:52:15.198 --> 00:52:16.500
SHOOTING THERE WAS THIS MANY

00:52:16.566 --> 00:52:17.734
VICTIMS THEY DON'T REALLY GO

00:52:17.801 --> 00:52:21.404
INTO THE FACT OF. HOW IT WENT

00:52:21.471 --> 00:52:22.873
DOWN OR- WHETHER NOT THE FIRE

00:52:22.939 --> 00:52:24.541
ALARM WAS PULLED SO IT'S REALLY

00:52:24.608 --> 00:52:26.843
DIFFICULT FOR US TO GET THOSE

00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:28.512
STATISTICS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT

00:52:28.578 --> 00:52:29.246
A FARMS BEEN TOLD. IN THE

00:52:29.312 --> 00:52:31.248
FUTURE WE HAVE FOUND THERE IS A

00:52:31.314 --> 00:52:33.817
SLIGHT MENTIONS OF FIRE ALARMS

00:52:33.884 --> 00:52:34.985
BEING PULLED BUT WE DO SEE THAT

00:52:35.051 --> 00:52:37.721
AS A LARGE RISK- WHETHER OR NOT

00:52:37.787 --> 00:52:38.788
IT IS BEEN SHOWN IS COMMON IN

00:52:38.855 --> 00:52:41.758
CALIFORNIA. BUT IT SEEMS AS

00:52:41.825 --> 00:52:44.694
IT'S BECOMING A COMMON THING

00:52:44.761 --> 00:52:47.230
WITHIN THE UNITED STATES FROM

00:52:47.297 --> 00:52:48.632
THE STE- DIFFERENT STUDIES THAT

00:52:48.698 --> 00:52:50.734
WE FOUND. ALSO BEING LIKE SUCH

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.602
A HIGH PROFILE CASE WE FELT

00:52:52.669 --> 00:52:53.470
THAT LIKE YOU GUYS WOULD

00:52:53.537 --> 00:52:54.704
ALREADY HAVE SOME BACKGROUND IN

00:52:54.771 --> 00:52:57.440
IT RESONATE MORE. AND ALSO THAT

00:52:57.507 --> 00:53:01.144
LAKE LINK IT TOOK ALL THE

00:53:01.211 --> 00:53:01.745
WALKOUTS AND HOW LIKE STUDENTS

00:53:01.811 --> 00:53:05.849
WANT CHANGE NOW. AND REGARDLESS

00:53:05.916 --> 00:53:07.417
OF THE FREQUENCY OF ACTUALLY

00:53:07.484 --> 00:53:07.951
USING A FIRE ALARM TO YOUR

00:53:08.018 --> 00:53:09.319
STUDENTS OUT- IT'S STILL

00:53:09.386 --> 00:53:10.620
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S- AN

00:53:10.687 --> 00:53:16.593
EASILY ADJUSTABLE. AND IT'S NOT

00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:18.662
AS IN WILL NOT NECESSARILY

00:53:18.728 --> 00:53:20.664
AFFECT EVERYONE BUT IT'S- EASY

00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:24.134
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:25.335
WELL I THINK WE COULD EMPHASIZE

00:53:25.402 --> 00:53:27.938
THAT POINT A LOT MORE BECAUSE I

THAT. IT'S COMMON IT'S A COMMON

00:53:37.213 --> 00:53:39.082
USE NEED TO MAKE THE CASE THAT

00:53:39.149 --> 00:53:42.385
IT IS USED AND THEREFORE IT

00:53:42.452 --> 00:53:42.953

01:03:58.434 --> 01:04:00.570
PROCESS OF CREATING A PLAN THAT

01:04:00.636 --> 01:04:01.771

OF WHAT THEY COULD DO SUCH AS

01:04:23.259 --> 01:04:25.127
YOGA ARE MINDFUL MINUTES AND

01:04:25.194 --> 01:04:26.562
TEACHERS COULD DECIDE WHICH

01:04:26.629 --> 01:04:28.431
ONES THEY WANTED TO DO AND

IS JUST ONE. OF A LARGE ISSUE

01:13:10.419 --> 01:13:11.220
SO THIS IS THE WAY THAT WE

01:13:11.286 --> 01:13:12.821

ALREADY TAKING KIND OF STAFF OF

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:25.901
THIS I THINK WHAT YOU'RE-

01:13:25.968 --> 01:13:27.770
SEEKING TO DO IS REBOOT THIS-

01:13:27.836 --> 01:13:29.571

RIGHT I HAVE ONE WARY AND IT

01:13:42.785 --> 01:13:45.187

01:13:47.956 --> 01:13:50.359
EXETER WAS ALSO ABOUT-

01:13:50.425 --> 01:13:51.827
FERMENTING SOME CROSS CULTURAL

01:13:51.894 --> 01:13:53.328

NAME MAYBE NEEDS TO. TO REBOOT

01:14:14.850 --> 01:14:16.485
THAT SOME THINGS TO THINK ABOUT

01:14:16.552 --> 01:14:18.287
IS IT'S ALREADY DIFFICULT TO

01:14:18.353 --> 01:14:19.354
BECOME A TEACHER. MARTIN AND

01:14:19.421 --> 01:14:21.857
EXPENSIVE. TO GET THAT

01:14:21.924 --> 01:14:24.927
CREDENTIAL YOU GO FOR YEARS AND

01:14:24.993 --> 01:14:26.662
THEN YOU GO ANOTHER YEAR. MORE

01:14:26.728 --> 01:14:27.763
CREDENTIALED IS PRETTY

01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:31.200
EXPENSIVE TO OBTAIN PRETTY

01:14:31.266 --> 01:14:31.800
CUMBERSOME TAKES A LOT OF TIME

01:14:31.867 --> 01:14:33.802

01:14:33.869 --> 01:14:34.369
YOU KNOW YOU DO THE STUDENT

01:14:34.436 --> 01:14:35.404
TEACHING AND- TO HOLD A JOB

01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:37.239
REALLY WHEN YOU'RE DOING THAT

01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:37.840
SO IT'S PRETTY TOUGH ENTRY TO

01:14:37.906 --> 01:14:39.575
GET. TO BECOME A TEACHER. SO

01:14:39.641 --> 01:14:40.409

01:14:49.051 --> 01:14:49.751
EXPERIENCE THAT MIGHT BE

01:14:49.818 --> 01:14:51.286
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT TO. TO

01:14:51.353 --> 01:14:53.722
MAKE YOUR YOUR PROPOSITION. A

01:14:53.789 --> 01:14:56.291
MORE VIABLE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE

01:14:56.358 --> 01:14:56.825
A LITTLE BIT LEERY OF YOUR

LIKE THIS WILL PROBABLY DO. YOU

01:15:13.542 --> 01:15:15.410
COULD DO A COUPLE DIFFERENT

01:15:15.477 --> 01:15:16.445
WAYS WE WERE DIRECT THEM. MAYBE

PRESENTATION OF THINK THAT.

01:15:54.149 --> 01:15:56.118
EVERY EVERY POINT YOU MAY IS

01:15:56.184 --> 01:15:57.386
RIGHT ON POINT AND I THINK THE

01:15:57.452 --> 01:15:59.321
CHAIR HAD A- OF. A GOOD

01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:01.390
SUGGESTION IN THAT THERE ARE IF

01:16:01.456 --> 01:16:02.524
THERE'S ALREADY SOMETHING IN

01:16:02.591 --> 01:16:03.892
PLACE OFTENTIMES SPECIALLY WAS

01:16:03.959 --> 01:16:05.661
BEEN AROUND FOR TWENTY YEARS.

01:16:05.727 --> 01:16:06.495
THERE'S ALWAYS OPPORTUNITIES

01:16:06.561 --> 01:16:08.330
REVISE IT TO REFRESH IT.

01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:09.598
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE CURRENT

01:16:09.665 --> 01:16:11.667
ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'RE IN- AND

01:16:11.733 --> 01:16:12.701
THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT

01:16:12.768 --> 01:16:13.835
STUDENTS ARE GOING THROUGH NOW

01:16:13.902 --> 01:16:14.670
THAT THEY WEREN'T GOING THROUGH

01:16:14.736 --> 01:16:16.171
TWENTY YEARS AGO AND- BUT

01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:17.439
TEACHERS NEED TO KNOW ABOUT

01:16:17.506 --> 01:16:18.073
THAT. AND SO I THINK THERE MAY

01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:20.442
BE AN OPPORTUNITY- REALLY TO

01:16:20.509 --> 01:16:21.843
WORK WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:24.813

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:25.614
A WORK ON UPDATING AND

01:16:25.681 --> 01:16:28.083
REFRESHING- AND ALL OF THESE

01:16:28.150 --> 01:16:30.385
ARE EXISTING EXISTENT IN THE

01:16:30.452 --> 01:16:31.753
CODE. AND THE CREDENTIALING

01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:34.156
PROCESS- I SUPPOSE INTRODUCING

01:16:34.222 --> 01:16:35.290
SOMETHING NEW WHEN YOU KNOW AND

01:16:35.357 --> 01:16:36.458
SOMETIMES AS- MANY THAT COULD

01:16:36.525 --> 01:16:39.861
BE. A MORE BUT ALSO PRODUCE

01:16:39.928 --> 01:16:41.530
EVEN BETTER RESULTS THAN AS

01:16:41.596 --> 01:16:44.333
THE- AS THE CHAIRS AND A-

01:16:44.399 --> 01:16:44.866
HUNDRED TWENTY LEGISLATURE

01:16:44.933 --> 01:16:46.134
FIGURE OUT. WHAT THE BEST WAY

01:16:46.201 --> 01:16:46.768
TO DO IT IS THAT IT DOES WHEN

01:16:46.835 --> 01:16:47.602
IT COMES DOWN TO GROUND LEVEL.

01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:49.738
OF INVENTING IT. IS AT LEAST A

01:16:49.805 --> 01:16:50.639
DOZEN ACTUALLY SERVE THE GOLD

01:16:50.706 --> 01:16:52.040
YOU'RE TRYING TO. REACH AND SO

01:16:52.107 --> 01:16:54.676
BUT I OTHERWISE. THE GOAL WHAT

01:16:54.743 --> 01:16:55.243
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS VERY

01:16:55.310 --> 01:16:56.378
LAUDABLE AND I APPRECIATE THE

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:58.380
PRESENTATION ON IT. AND THE

01:16:58.447 --> 01:17:02.751
CAMEL. IS A HORSE DESIGNED BY

01:17:02.818 --> 01:17:07.456

01:17:10.025 --> 01:17:12.794
SEE FROM THE DELEGATES IS A

01:17:12.861 --> 01:17:13.528
RICHER FOR DELEGATES THE

01:17:13.595 --> 01:17:14.896
DELEGATES THAT YOU HAVE A VERY

01:17:14.963 --> 01:17:17.699
DIVERSE. REPRESENTATION I THINK

01:17:17.766 --> 01:17:19.801
OF US STUDENT BODIES THROUGHOUT

01:17:19.868 --> 01:17:22.437
CALIFORNIA- SOMETHING THAT'S

01:17:22.504 --> 01:17:26.908
NOT. DIRECTLY DIRECTLY RELATED

01:17:26.975 --> 01:17:30.112
TO YOUR PROPOSAL BUT WE ARE- WE

01:17:30.178 --> 01:17:31.146
ARE IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN THE

01:17:31.213 --> 01:17:34.082
STATE STRUGGLING WITH THE FACT

01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:35.317
THAT THERE HAVE BEEN BUILT IN

01:17:35.384 --> 01:17:38.453
BIASES- EITHER ON THE BASIS OF

01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:40.756
FAITH OR ON THE BIG BASES OF

01:17:40.822 --> 01:17:42.290
ETHNICITY OR WHERE YOU WERE

01:17:42.357 --> 01:17:44.993
BORN. AND THIS NATION HAS BEEN

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:46.328
STRUGGLING WITH THAT SINCE ITS

01:17:46.395 --> 01:17:49.197
INCEPTION- AND WE'RE ALWAYS

01:17:49.264 --> 01:17:50.866
TRYING T FIGURE OUT HOW WE

01:17:50.932 --> 01:17:52.434
SHOULD ALWAYS BE TRYING TO

01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:55.103
FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE REMIND

01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:56.705
OURSELVES THAT WE ARE A NATION

01:17:56.772 --> 01:17:59.441
OF DIVERSITY NOT OF ONE RACE OR

01:17:59.508 --> 01:18:02.544
NOT OF ONE FAITH- WE'VE HAD BIG

01:18:02.611 --> 01:18:05.113
DEBATES APPEAR. OVER ETHNIC

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:07.983
STUDIES AS A WAY TO MAKE SURE

01:18:08.050 --> 01:18:11.186
THAT EVERYONE LEARNS ABOUT

01:18:11.253 --> 01:18:14.623
HISTORY TO HISTORY AND- WHAT IT

01:18:14.689 --> 01:18:16.324
HAS TAKEN FOR PEOPLE'S FROM ALL

01:18:16.391 --> 01:18:18.093
OVER THE WORLD TO COME HERE.

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:21.663
AND. AND ADOPT THIS NATION

01:18:21.730 --> 01:18:24.699
CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD- SO

01:18:24.766 --> 01:18:27.069
IT'S ALWAYS IT'S BEEN AN ISSUE

01:18:27.135 --> 01:18:28.070
HERE I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE YEAR

01:18:28.136 --> 01:18:30.005
BUT I'VE ALREADY SEEN- THE

01:18:30.072 --> 01:18:32.641
DEBATES AROUND IT- THIS IS

01:18:32.707 --> 01:18:34.176
ANOTHER WAY TO ADDRESS THE

01:18:34.242 --> 01:18:36.778
ISSUE. BY MAKING SURE THAT

01:18:36.845 --> 01:18:41.283
TEACHERS ARE- CONTINUOUSLY. THE

01:18:41.349 --> 01:18:45.120
SAY UPGRADED OR UPDATED- AND

01:18:45.187 --> 01:18:47.155
REMINDED- BUT IT'S SOMETHING

01:18:47.222 --> 01:18:50.525
THAT EVERYONE STUDENTS YOUR AGE

01:18:50.592 --> 01:18:54.696
YOUNGER. IF YOU WANT TO BE A-

01:18:54.763 --> 01:18:56.631
GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE GRADUATE

01:18:56.698 --> 01:18:57.866
FROM HIGH SCHOOL SHOULD THOSE

01:18:57.933 --> 01:19:02.104
BE REQUIREMENTS SO. I URGE YOU

01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:03.605
TO STAY CONNECTED TO THAT

01:19:03.672 --> 01:19:06.074
BROADER DEBATE AS WELL AS A

01:19:06.141 --> 01:19:08.076
VERY SPECIFIC PROPOSAL THAT

01:19:08.143 --> 01:19:09.678

O'DONNELL'S POINT AND TO KIND

01:19:16.518 --> 01:19:17.719
OF GO BACK TO WHAT MISTER KALRA

01:19:17.786 --> 01:19:18.420
IF I'M PRONOUNCING THAT

01:19:18.487 --> 01:19:20.522
CORRECTLY- WAS TALKING ABOUT-

01:19:20.589 --> 01:19:22.591
WE ACTUALLY INVESTIGATED THE CD

01:19:22.657 --> 01:19:23.725
EITHER CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

01:19:23.792 --> 01:19:26.161
EDUCATION'S WEBSITE. AND WE

01:19:26.228 --> 01:19:28.597
LOOK THROUGH I GUESS IT WAS A

01:19:28.663 --> 01:19:30.232
SORT OF TOOL KIT TO ASSIST

01:19:30.298 --> 01:19:31.933
TEACHERS WHEN THEY ARE TRYING

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.568
TO BE LIKE CULTURALLY COMPETENT

01:19:33.635 --> 01:19:34.469
TO ESSENTIALLY TEACH CULTURAL

01:19:34.536 --> 01:19:36.671
COMPETENCY. AND WE ACTUALLY

01:19:36.738 --> 01:19:37.772
FOUND A LOT OF WHAT YOU'RE

01:19:37.839 --> 01:19:39.407
TALKING ABOUT MISTER KALRA-

01:19:39.474 --> 01:19:41.143
WHERE A LOT OF THE MATERIALS

01:19:41.209 --> 01:19:42.377
WERE EITHER LIKE MISS

01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:44.146
REPRESENTATIVE OF LIKE THE

01:19:44.212 --> 01:19:45.714
STUDENTS WERE BEING PORTRAYED

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:46.681
IN THE VIDEOS OR WERE JUST.

01:19:46.748 --> 01:19:50.519
BLATANTLY NOT RIGHT TO FIGHT

01:19:50.585 --> 01:19:51.486
FOR TEACHERS TO BE LIKE LOOKING

01:19:51.553 --> 01:19:52.888
AT IT THROUGH THAT APPROACH AND

01:19:52.954 --> 01:19:54.356
I THINK THAT YOU GUYS REYES A

01:19:54.422 --> 01:19:56.091
REALLY IMPORTANT POINT AND I

01:19:56.158 --> 01:19:57.192
KNOW THAT YOU GUYS DON'T WANT

01:20:02.164 --> 01:20:03.231
WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING TODAY BUT

01:20:03.298 --> 01:20:04.733
THE PROPOSAL THAT WE'RE TRYING

01:20:04.799 --> 01:20:07.369
TO MAKE IS LESS OF KIND OF

01:20:07.435 --> 01:20:08.937
TRYING TO TEACH CULTURAL

01:20:09.004 --> 01:20:10.338
COMPETENCY BECAUSE AT THE END

01:20:10.405 --> 01:20:11.339
OF THE DAY LIKE IF WE WERE TO

01:20:11.406 --> 01:20:13.675

KNOW THE RIGHTS IS A VALUABLE-

01:34:57.124 --> 01:34:58.859
PART OF BEING IN A IN A

01:34:58.926 --> 01:35:00.494
DEMOCRACY BEING IN A FREE

01:35:00.561 --> 01:35:03.197
SOCIETY I DO THINK THAT- THE-

01:35:03.264 --> 01:35:05.199
CHERUB FURTHER- BUT WOULD YOU

01:35:05.266 --> 01:35:07.535
OUT OF VALUABLE ASPECT OF THIS

01:35:07.601 --> 01:35:09.470
WHICH IS THE DE ESCALATION.

01:35:09.537 --> 01:35:10.571
BRING A THIRD PARTY HAVE NOTS

01:35:10.638 --> 01:35:14.375
THAT'S A I THINK ULTIMATELY MAY

01:35:14.442 --> 01:35:16.911
PROVE TO BE EVEN MORE VALUABLE

01:35:16.977 --> 01:35:19.513
ASPECT OF THESE RIGHTS BEING

01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:21.215
DETAILED AND THE LAST THING I

01:35:21.282 --> 01:35:21.949
WANT TO MENTION WHICH I REALLY

01:35:22.016 --> 01:35:24.285
APPRECIATED THE PRIVACY ASPECT-

01:35:24.351 --> 01:35:27.154
THE PUBLIC SHAMING OF A STUDENT

01:35:27.221 --> 01:35:27.688
AND THE BUT THEY'RE GOING

01:35:27.755 --> 01:35:29.056
THROUGH CAN FURTHER ALIENATE

01:35:29.123 --> 01:35:30.991
THEM. AND THE PRIVACY ASPECT

01:35:31.058 --> 01:35:32.660
ACTUALLY EMPOWERS THEM IN IT

01:35:32.726 --> 01:35:34.395
AND ALSO YOU MAY END UP WITH

01:35:34.462 --> 01:35:35.529
THE RESULT WHERE A STUDENT WILL

01:35:35.596 --> 01:35:36.530
ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT THEY'VE DONE

01:35:36.597 --> 01:35:38.599
MUCH MORE QUICKLY BUT BECAUSE

01:35:38.666 --> 01:35:39.667
THEY'RE GIVING THE RESPECT OF

01:35:39.733 --> 01:35:42.036
THAT PRIVACY AND SO I REALLY

01:35:42.103 --> 01:35:43.137

01:35:55.049 --> 01:35:59.687
SEVERAL YEARS. THE SUSPENSIONS-

01:35:59.753 --> 01:36:00.721
LED DIRECTLY TO A GREATER

01:36:00.788 --> 01:36:01.355
NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE ENTERING

01:36:01.422 --> 01:36:05.126
THE. IS LIKE THE PIPELINE TO

01:36:05.192 --> 01:36:09.597
PRISON- AND ANYTHING THAT WOULD

01:36:09.663 --> 01:36:11.966
STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING I

01:36:12.032 --> 01:36:16.570
THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT. SO

01:36:16.637 --> 01:36:19.406
REDUCTIONS I'M I'M I DIDN'T

01:36:19.473 --> 01:36:22.243
QUITE GET THAT YOU WERE MAKING

01:36:22.309 --> 01:36:25.279
THE POINT OF PREVENTION. UP

01:36:25.346 --> 01:36:28.048
MORE MORE DIRECTLY I THINK TO

01:36:28.115 --> 01:36:32.153
MAKE THAT A VERY EXPLICIT. OLD

01:36:32.219 --> 01:36:34.054
THAT THIS WOULD SERVE AS A

01:36:34.121 --> 01:36:37.024
PREVENTATIVE MEASURE VERSES

01:36:37.091 --> 01:36:38.526

01:36:43.764 --> 01:36:47.668
PEOPLE KNOW OF BUT I THINK THIS

01:36:47.735 --> 01:36:49.403
SERVES A GREATER PURPOSE WHICH

01:36:49.470 --> 01:36:52.206
IS NOT AFTER THE FACT OF IT SO

01:36:52.273 --> 01:36:53.574
YOU KNOW YOUR RIGHTS AND YOU

01:36:53.641 --> 01:36:55.142

MORE PREVENTATIVE MEASURE SO I

01:36:59.914 --> 01:37:01.148

01:37:03.150 --> 01:37:05.953

01:45:21.214 --> 01:45:22.182
MEAN I WOULD JUST WILL RAISE

01:45:22.249 --> 01:45:23.050

CHAIRMAN- MENTIONED- THIS IS

01:45:38.799 --> 01:45:40.233
SOMETHING THAT SOME VERSION OF

01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:42.002
THIS HAS BEEN TAKEN UP AND IT

01:45:42.069 --> 01:45:43.537
REALLY TAKES A LOT OF HARD

01:45:43.603 --> 01:45:46.139
WORK- I THINK IT WOULD BE

01:45:46.206 --> 01:45:47.741
WORTH. YOUR TIME AND EFFORT AND

01:45:47.808 --> 01:45:50.210
EVERYONE ELSE IN THE ROOM- BUT

01:45:50.277 --> 01:45:51.645
IT IT REALLY TAKES A LOT OF

01:45:51.712 --> 01:45:54.981
CONSCIOUSNESS. RAISING OF AND

01:45:55.048 --> 01:45:56.149

BETTER NEEDED TO HIGHLIGHT THE

01:46:04.991 --> 01:46:06.560
ISSUE OTHERWISE IT BECOMES

01:46:06.626 --> 01:46:09.696
SOMETHING THAT'S DETACHED. SO I

01:46:09.763 --> 01:46:10.230
HAVE FOUND THAT THE MORE

01:46:10.297 --> 01:46:12.265
PERSONAL STORIES ARE WHICH IN

01:46:12.332 --> 01:46:14.434
THIS CASE IS DIFFICULT TO DO.

01:46:14.501 --> 01:46:17.704
THE BUT THE MORE EFFECTIVE. THE

01:46:17.771 --> 01:46:20.974
MESSAGE IS ABOUT THE AGENCY. TO

01:46:21.041 --> 01:46:22.509
DEAL WITH IT AND TO RESOLVE IT

01:46:22.576 --> 01:46:25.612

01:46:44.564 --> 01:46:45.732
UP TO BE ABLE TO USE IT BECAUSE

01:46:45.799 --> 01:46:47.300

PERMANENTLY. THANK YOU FOR

01:47:06.653 --> 01:47:07.654
BRINGING THIS UP I THINK IT'S

01:47:07.721 --> 01:47:10.357
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUE- WE

01:47:10.423 --> 01:47:12.259
HAVE HYGIENE PRODUCTS IN BOTH

01:47:12.325 --> 01:47:14.628
OF MY DISTRICT OFFICES ARE JUST

01:47:14.694 --> 01:47:16.296
IN CASE SOMEONE WERE TO NEED

01:47:16.363 --> 01:47:20.567
SOMETHING AS THE EXPENSE IS AN

01:47:20.634 --> 01:47:22.402
ISSUE- TO DO IT STATE WIDE

01:47:22.469 --> 01:47:24.471
DOESN'T MEAN IT SHOULD PROHIBIT

01:47:24.538 --> 01:47:25.772
US FROM DOING IT JUST MEANS WE

01:47:25.839 --> 01:47:27.674
SHOULD BE COGNIZANT OF THAT. I

01:47:27.741 --> 01:47:29.709
AGREE WITH SENATOR TO ROSS SO

01:47:29.776 --> 01:47:31.878
HAVING- STORIES HAVING-

01:47:31.945 --> 01:47:33.914
TESTIMONY IS INCREDIBLY

01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:37.150
IMPORTANT- ANY BILL THAT WE DO

01:47:37.217 --> 01:47:38.819
IN THIS BUILDING WHEN WE HAVE

01:47:38.885 --> 01:47:42.055
REAL STORIES AND REAL PEOPLE IT

01:47:42.122 --> 01:47:43.757
MAKES SUCH A DIFFERENCE SO

01:47:43.824 --> 01:47:46.159
THINK ABOUT WHO YOU CAN GET

01:47:46.226 --> 01:47:48.795
WILL KIND OF TESTIMONY YOU CAN

01:47:48.862 --> 01:47:50.730
GET- IT'S HIS TO SHARE THE

01:47:50.797 --> 01:47:52.933
STORY. OF BIG AND I THINK IT'S

01:47:52.999 --> 01:47:53.567
SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE I REMEMBER

01:47:53.633 --> 01:47:55.268
WHEN I WAS INJURED HI. A LONG

01:47:55.335 --> 01:48:04.177
TIME AGO AND YOU. THAT SEE YOU

01:48:04.244 --> 01:48:06.413
KNOW EVERYBODY'S GONNA KNOW AND

01:48:06.479 --> 01:48:07.948
SO WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

01:48:08.014 --> 01:48:09.449
TAKING CARE OF OUR YOUNG WOMAN

01:48:09.516 --> 01:48:10.417
WOMEN AND THAT THERE'S

01:48:10.483 --> 01:48:12.385
SOMETHING THERE- AND I THINK

01:48:12.452 --> 01:48:14.754
WHAT IT ALSO DOES IS IF IT'S IF

01:48:14.821 --> 01:48:16.489
WE OFFER THESE PRODUCTS FOR

01:48:16.556 --> 01:48:17.891
FREE- AND THEY'RE AVAILABLE I

01:48:17.958 --> 01:48:20.427
THINK IT TAKES AWAY SOME STIGMA

01:48:20.493 --> 01:48:21.494
BECAUSE I THINK THAT YOUNG

01:48:21.561 --> 01:48:22.863
WOMEN STILL FEEL BAD ABOUT

01:48:22.929 --> 01:48:24.197
HAVING THEIR PERIOD- WHICH YOU

01:48:24.264 --> 01:48:25.298
SHOULD NOT. BUT I DO REMEMBER I

01:48:25.365 --> 01:48:28.935
DID AND SO WE NEED TO FIGURE

01:48:29.002 --> 01:48:30.904
OUT A WAY TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN

01:48:30.971 --> 01:48:31.938

THAT BARELY HAS MONEY TO PUT

01:48:36.142 --> 01:48:38.211
FOOD ON THE TABLE. WHO CAN

01:48:38.278 --> 01:48:39.980

01:52:16.896 --> 01:52:17.430
THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T LISTEN

HALF OF THE MEMBERS HAVE TO BE

01:52:46.259 --> 01:52:47.794
UNDER EIGHTEEN HALF OF THEM

01:52:47.861 --> 01:52:49.195

PARTICULARLY PRODUCT IS A

01:53:06.579 --> 01:53:07.680
PROVISION THAT AT LEAST HALF OF

01:53:07.747 --> 01:53:09.082
THE MEMBERS ON THE COMMISSION

01:53:09.149 --> 01:53:10.650

DISABILITIES OR JUVENILE

01:53:16.422 --> 01:53:18.658
INCARCERATION. THE IDEA OF THIS

01:53:18.725 --> 01:53:20.960
BILL IS TRULY TO UPLIFT THOSE

01:53:21.027 --> 01:53:22.996
UNDER REPRESENTED VOICES THAT

A KID IN SAN DIEGO WHO IS- AND

TO SACRAMENTO TO TALK ABOUT

01:53:41.114 --> 01:53:42.415
THEIR ISSUE. WHICH IS WHY THE

01:53:42.482 --> 01:53:45.218
COMMISSION IT SHOULD BE X.

01:53:45.285 --> 01:53:48.922
ENTIRELY COST FREE. AND

01:53:48.988 --> 01:53:50.356
ADDITIONALLY COMMISSIONERS

01:53:50.423 --> 01:53:51.457
RECEIVE A THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR

PER DIEM TO BE FAIRLY

01:53:53.459 --> 01:53:54.894
COMPENSATE THEM FOR THE WORK

01:53:54.961 --> 01:53:56.596
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE SO MANY OF

01:53:56.663 --> 01:53:58.231
THESE COMMISSIONERS ARE THOSE

01:53:58.298 --> 01:53:59.632

01:54:09.342 --> 01:54:11.077
AND THEY DO THIS USING THREE

01:54:11.144 --> 01:54:12.712
DIFFERENT ARE THERE TOSS WITH

01:54:12.779 --> 01:54:14.280
DOING THREE DIFFERENT THINGS.

01:54:14.347 --> 01:54:16.916

AND FUNDED ENTIRELY BY THE

01:54:47.647 --> 01:54:49.616
GOVERNMENT. SECOND COMMUNITY

TWENTY FOUR MEMBERS ENGAGED AND

EMPOWERED. THERE'S ALSO A

01:55:29.822 --> 01:55:31.924
RIPPLE EFFECT THAT COMES FROM

01:55:31.991 --> 01:55:36.796
THIS BECAUSE. BECAUSE THERE'S A

01:55:36.863 --> 01:55:38.831
RIPPLE EFFECT BECAUSE AS YOUNG

01:55:38.898 --> 01:55:41.501

WHERE THE GOVERNMENT IS AND THE

01:55:48.808 --> 01:55:51.511
TRUE POWER OF DEMOCRACY-

01:55:51.577 --> 01:55:53.546
ADDITIONALLY THE COMMISSION CAN

01:55:53.613 --> 01:55:56.482
APPOINT. OTHER MEMBERS BETTER

01:55:56.549 --> 01:55:58.651

THAT DEPENDS ON THE COMMISSION

01:56:10.396 --> 01:56:11.230
BUT THEY HAVE THE POWER TO DO

01:56:11.297 --> 01:56:14.233
SO. THE THIRD IS INVESTMENT IN

01:56:14.300 --> 01:56:15.835
USE AND THIS IS A PRETTY NEW

01:56:15.902 --> 01:56:17.770
IDEA- IT'S CALLED YOU FLOOD

PEOPLE- THIS IS A GOOD IDEA

01:56:32.752 --> 01:56:34.287
BECAUSE CURRENTLY THE BUDGET

01:56:34.354 --> 01:56:36.489
PROCESS IS VERY DIFFICULT AND

01:56:36.556 --> 01:56:38.157
HARD TO NAVIGATE BUT I'M SURE

01:56:38.224 --> 01:56:40.259
THAT THE STATE WANTS TO INVEST.

01:56:40.326 --> 01:56:41.694
IN PROGRAMS THAT WORK ON A

01:56:41.761 --> 01:56:43.730
LOCAL LEVEL A LOT OF THESE NON

01:56:43.796 --> 01:56:46.032
PROFITS DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW

01:56:46.099 --> 01:56:47.500
TO NAVIGATE THE LEGISLATIVE

01:56:47.567 --> 01:56:48.801
PROCESS AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

01:56:48.868 --> 01:56:51.637
FOR THEM SO A LOT OF THEM

01:56:51.704 --> 01:56:52.772
AREN'T ABLE TO GET TAKE

01:56:52.839 --> 01:56:54.807
ADVANTAGE OF THE STATE'S FUNDS

01:56:54.874 --> 01:56:56.142
SO THIS FOLLOWS THE DIRECTION

01:56:56.209 --> 01:56:58.044
OF THE- CALIFORNIA ARTS

01:56:58.111 --> 01:57:00.947
COMMISSION. WHICH GETS AROUND

01:57:01.013 --> 01:57:01.514
TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS A

01:57:01.581 --> 01:57:02.815
YEAR AND THEY DID GIVE OUT

01:57:02.882 --> 01:57:05.685
MONEY THEY GIVE OUT STATE FUNDS

01:57:05.752 --> 01:57:07.220
TO LOCAL ARTISTS TO HELP

01:57:07.286 --> 01:57:09.655
ENHANCE ARTISTS ALL ACROSS THE

01:57:09.722 --> 01:57:11.657
STATE THIS WOULD APPLY THAT

01:57:11.724 --> 01:57:14.160
SAME LOGIC BUT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE

01:57:14.227 --> 01:57:16.529
AND ALL THE- PROGRAMS THAT

01:57:16.596 --> 01:57:17.096
YOUNG PEOPLE. PARTICIPATE IN

01:57:17.163 --> 01:57:20.366
TODAY. AB DEAL DIRECTLY WITH

01:57:20.433 --> 01:57:20.967
KIDS THAT ARE IN THE JUVENILE

01:57:21.033 --> 01:57:21.601
INCARCERATION SYSTEM PROGRAMS

01:57:21.667 --> 01:57:22.635
THAT ARE DEALING WITH KIDS IN

01:57:22.702 --> 01:57:24.303
FOSTER CARE ALL THOSE NON

01:57:24.370 --> 01:57:26.205
PROFITS THEY NEED THE SUPPORT.

01:57:26.272 --> 01:57:28.241
AND THEY'RE VERY LOW FUNDED BUT

01:57:28.307 --> 01:57:29.942
I KNOW THE STATE WANTS TO FUND

01:57:30.009 --> 01:57:31.177
THEM BUT THERE IS THE

01:57:31.244 --> 01:57:33.045
COMPLICATED LESS THAT PROCESS

01:57:33.112 --> 01:57:34.347
THAT CAN BE OVER RUN BY THIS

01:57:34.414 --> 01:57:36.249
AND FURTHER MORE. HELPS EMPOWER

01:57:36.315 --> 01:57:38.184
YOUNG PEOPLE TO HELP MAKE THOSE

01:57:38.251 --> 01:57:41.220
DECISIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE.

01:57:41.287 --> 01:57:43.122
SO THAT'S KIND OF WHERE THE

01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:45.291
COMMISSION IS OUT- JUST SOME

01:57:45.358 --> 01:57:48.060

THE- THE- THE CHALLENGE OF

GETTING REPRESENTATION FROM.

02:00:18.411 --> 02:00:20.146

COUNTY OF TEN MILLION PEOPLE.

02:00:27.553 --> 02:00:30.690
IT'S KIND OF HARD TO SEE HAVING

02:00:30.756 --> 02:00:33.492
NOT HAVING MORE REPRESENTATION-

02:00:33.559 --> 02:00:35.661
IS ALSO GREAT I THINK DIVERSITY

02:00:35.728 --> 02:00:39.131
AND A LOT OF OTHER. ISSUES SO

02:00:39.198 --> 02:00:42.201
IT'S JUST ONE ISSUE AS THE

02:00:42.268 --> 02:00:45.071

02:00:45.137 --> 02:00:47.239
LOT YOU KNOW TO READ HERE BUT I

02:00:47.306 --> 02:00:49.609

AND SO IN TERMS OF THE JUROR

02:01:15.067 --> 02:01:16.135
OFF LOCATIONS- WE DIVIDED IT

02:01:16.202 --> 02:01:17.903

WERE IDENTIFIED BY THE US

02:01:19.338 --> 02:01:23.476

THE BILL LANGUAGE IT SPECIFIES

02:01:25.044 --> 02:01:26.679
