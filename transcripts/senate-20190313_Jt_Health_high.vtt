ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE.

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:15.648
ON INCREASING ACCESS TO

00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:16.816
TREATMENT AND SERVICES IN

A WELCOME EVERYONE HERE.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.188
AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK --

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:23.656
CHAIR WOULD HAVE.

00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:25.725
FOR BEING HERE AS WELL I JUST

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:28.828
WANTED -- IF

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:29.929
YOU SAY THAT YOU WERE HOLDING

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:30.630
THESE HEARINGS BECAUSE THE

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.232
OPIOID EPIDEMIC CONTINUES THE

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:34.134
FACT THIS NATION IN CALIFORNIA

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.002
AND WHILE CERTAINLY THE OVERALL

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:38.405
RATE OF OPIATE RELATED DEATHS.

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:39.906
OVERDOSE DEATHS IS LOWERED IN

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:42.142
CALIFORNIA AND OTHER PARTS OF

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:42.842
THE COUNTRY.

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:44.411
THERE ARE AREAS WITHIN OUR STATE

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:45.845
WHERE RATES ARE FIVE TIMES

00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:47.714
HIGHEST THE STATE AVERAGE AND

00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:49.549
PEOPLE ARE DYING FROM THIS --

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:50.817
THESE HIGH RATES ARE EVEN MORE

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:52.252
CONCERNING BECAUSE THE STATE THE

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:53.486
STATS ARE HAPPENING IN REGIONS

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:55.288
OF THE STATE THAT OFTEN LACK

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:56.856
ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE VERTICALLY

00:00:56.923 --> 00:00:58.758
SPECIALLY SERVICES.

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:01.327
AND OF THIS YOU SERVICES.

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:02.729
SO THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT WELL

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:04.230
ALL STE AREAS OF THE STATE ARE

00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:06.933
AFFECTED EVEN LARGE URBAN AREAS

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.767
THAT TRADITIONALLY MORE ACCESS

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:09.436
TO HEALTH CARE.

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:10.737
AND SOCIAL SERVICES AS WELL.

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:12.739
AND I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT --

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:14.808
THE SURGEON GENERAL DR DRUM

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:16.342
ADAMS WAS MADE --

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.277
THE OPIOID CRISIS CERTAINLY A

00:01:17.343 --> 00:01:18.211
PRIORITY --

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:20.280
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL --

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:24.350
AS WELL AND WE WE NEED TO THINK

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:25.718
TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS.

00:01:25.785 --> 00:01:26.653
OUT HERE IN THIS STATE WE'VE

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:28.254
TAKEN ON TWO PROJECTS THE DRUG

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:29.522
MEDI CAL ORGANIZED DELIVERY

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:31.157

AND WE'LL BE HEARING MORE ABOUT

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:34.527
THOSE AND THEY'RE HELPING TO

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:35.762

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.096
INTEGRATION.

00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:38.498
AND HOPEFULLY ALSO INCREASE

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:42.001
SERVICES AND A ROLL REGIONS BUT

00:01:42.068 --> 00:01:42.635
CERTAINLY THERE ARE CHALLENGES

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:43.336
AS I MENTIONED THE ROLE THE

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:44.938
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND SOME OF

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:47.140

AND THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THE

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:52.312
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS PARTNERS

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:53.179

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:54.948
AND AND SOLVING THIS CRISIS SO

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:55.748
WE MUST EXPLORE ALL THESE

00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:57.250
PROJECTS AND DISCUSS WHAT WE CAN

00:01:57.317 --> 00:01:58.718
DO THE STATE AND THROUGH

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:00.353
PARTNERSHIPS WITH MANY OF THE

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.221
FACT THAT THESE STAKEHOLDERS.

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:02.522
FISHER WE SUSTAIN THESE

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:04.390

POINT NINE MILLION FOUR AND A

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:37.183
HALF MILLION LOWER THAN WHAT

WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST --

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:40.186

00:05:58.991 --> 00:06:01.094
ORGANIZED FULL CONTINUUM OF CARE

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.462
DOESN'T DO FULL JUSTICE TO IT

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:07.200
BUT IT'S WHERE I CITIES SEATED --

00:06:07.266 --> 00:06:08.968
WORKING INTO THIS.

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:10.937
THIS HEARING ON APPEAL ITS FIFTH

00:06:11.003 --> 00:06:11.537
SPECIFICALLY.

00:06:11.604 --> 00:06:12.905
IT DOES INCLUDE OPIOID TREATMENT

00:06:12.972 --> 00:06:15.108
IT DOES IT'S NOT LIMITED TO THAT --

00:06:15.174 --> 00:06:16.509
A PARTICIPATING COUNTIES ARE

00:06:16.576 --> 00:06:18.644
REQUIRED TO HAVE --

00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:20.913
AT ACCESS TO TO PROVIDE ACCESS

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.348
TO A TO A TREATMENT PROGRAMS AND

00:06:22.415 --> 00:06:23.516
THOSE PROGRAMS ARE ARE ARE

00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:25.518
REQUIRED TO PROVIDE ALL FDA

00:06:25.585 --> 00:06:27.053
APPROVED MEDICATIONS FOR

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.089
SUBSTANCES DISORDERS --

00:06:30.156 --> 00:06:32.558
SAID BUT DIEM SERIOUS GOES A

00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:33.259
GOES BEYOND OPIOIDS OF COURSE

00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:34.527
AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:06:34.594 --> 00:06:36.162
PLACE IT AND INTO CONTEXT

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.131
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THINGS LIKE

00:06:38.197 --> 00:06:39.232
METHAMPHETAMINES.

00:06:39.298 --> 00:06:40.566
EVEN WHEN I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT

00:06:40.633 --> 00:06:42.335
THAT TODAY THEY THEY ARE IN A

00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:44.203
INCREASING --

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:49.642
USE OF THAT IS INCREASING AND WE

00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:51.344
KNOW THAT.

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.212
IT IF WE JUST TEND TO ATTACK ONE

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:54.814
DRUG IT TENDS TO MANIFEST AGAIN

00:06:54.881 --> 00:06:55.948
IN IN IN IN OTHER PLACES WE'VE

00:06:56.015 --> 00:06:56.916
SEEN THAT WITH OPIOIDS WHEN WE

00:06:56.983 --> 00:06:58.484
ADDRESS PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND

00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:01.621
THE OF THE THE OVERDOSE DEATHS

00:07:01.687 --> 00:07:02.221
FOR ABSURD PRESCRIPTION DRUGS

00:07:02.288 --> 00:07:03.389
HAVE LEVELED OFF BUT THEN WE SEE

00:07:03.456 --> 00:07:04.624
INCREASES IN HEROIN.

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.092
AND AND FEDERAL DEATH SO --

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:08.327
DMCA ODS --

00:07:08.394 --> 00:07:10.696
I SEE AS SORT OF A BACKSTOP

00:07:10.763 --> 00:07:12.865
ADDRESSING ALL DRUGS --

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:13.933
SO WHERE ARE WE IN

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.568
IMPLEMENTATION FORTY COUNTIES OF

00:07:15.635 --> 00:07:15.768
IT --

00:07:15.835 --> 00:07:17.103
SUBMITTED IMPLEMENTATION PLANS

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.138
WOULD COVER ABOUT 97% OF OF THE

00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:21.240
STATE'S POPULATION BUT IT'S BEEN

00:07:21.307 --> 00:07:22.708
A HEAVY LEFT AND SO IT'S BEEN A

00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:23.709
A PROCESS TO GET ALL THE

00:07:23.776 --> 00:07:24.544
COUNTIES --

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.512
GOING THERE ARE STILL GOING LIFE

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:29.682
AS AS WE AS WE SPEAK IN.

00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:30.283
TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SO JUST

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:30.950
VERY BRIEFLY --

00:07:31.017 --> 00:07:31.884
THE THE RESULTS THATWE'RE

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:33.152
SEEING SO FAR IS THAT WE ARE

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:34.787
SEEING INCREASING NUMBERS OF

00:07:34.854 --> 00:07:36.556
PEOPLE COMING INTO TREATMENT --

00:07:36.622 --> 00:07:38.057
ABOUT 7%.

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:39.725
IN THE INITIAL SEVEN COUNTIES

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:40.593
BUT THE MIX OF TREATMENT IS

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.462
CHANGING SO MORE RESIDENTIAL --

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:46.332
THE THAN THAN THE PREVIOUSLY OF

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:47.500
THESE CHANGES AND PLACEMENT

00:07:47.567 --> 00:07:49.202
APPEAR TO BE APPROPRIATE BASED

00:07:49.268 --> 00:07:50.803
ON ASSESSMENTS THAT WE'VE SEEN --

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.606
IN 93% OF THE PATIENTS WERE COME

00:07:53.673 --> 00:07:54.574
COMING INTO TREATMENT AND RATE

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.275
THEIR TREATMENT POSITIVELY WHICH

00:07:56.342 --> 00:07:58.211
IS AT THE I THINK IS REMARKABLE --

00:07:58.277 --> 00:07:59.345
AND COUNTY ADMINISTRATORS

00:07:59.412 --> 00:08:00.646
OVERWHELMING OVERWHELMINGLY

00:08:00.713 --> 00:08:02.114
REPORT THAT THE WAIVER HAS HAD A

00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:07.320
POSITIVE IMPACT ON ON THERE ARE.

00:08:07.386 --> 00:08:10.223
A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT.

00:08:10.289 --> 00:08:11.524
SO IN SUMMARY JUSTICE --

00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:13.159
WHO WAS SO FAR FROM WHAT WE'VE

00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:14.760
SEEN A VERY --

00:08:14.827 --> 00:08:15.962
PROMISING INITIAL SIGNS THERE

00:08:16.028 --> 00:08:18.731
ARE THERE ARE CHALLENGES --

00:08:18.798 --> 00:08:19.866
A IT'S IT'S NOT PERFECT IT'S A

00:08:19.932 --> 00:08:22.101
HEAVY LIFT AS YOU CAN SEE WE ARE

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:23.903
STILL GETTING COUNTIES ON BOARD --

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.504
BECAUSE OF THAT AND WITH THE

00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:27.006
WAIVER ENDING IN TWENTY TWENTY I

00:08:27.073 --> 00:08:29.375
THINK IT IT MAKES SENSE --

00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:30.509
TO I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE

00:08:30.576 --> 00:08:31.510
DEPARTMENT BUT I THINK IT WOULD

00:08:31.577 --> 00:08:33.045
MAKE SENSE TO EXTEND ANOTHER

00:08:33.112 --> 00:08:33.713
CENTRIST.

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:34.580
SINCE WE'RE JUST GETTING THE

00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:37.483
SYSTEM AND AND A PLACE AS IT WAS

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:39.752
INTENDED --

00:08:39.819 --> 00:08:41.354
WITH THAT I THINK IT THE THEY'RE

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:42.722
ALL ALSO CHALLENGES PENETRATION

00:08:42.788 --> 00:08:43.689
RATES GETTING ENOUGH TREATMENT

00:08:43.756 --> 00:08:45.191
OUT THERE ONE OF THE MAIN

00:08:45.258 --> 00:08:46.325
REASONS THAT PEOPLE DON'T.

00:08:46.392 --> 00:08:48.094
OF GET INTO TREATMENT AS THEY

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.462
THEY DON'T THINK THAT THEY HAVE

00:08:49.528 --> 00:08:50.997
A LOT OF TREATMENT I'VE I'VE

00:08:51.063 --> 00:08:52.732
I'VE MODIFIED THE SLIDES I'M

00:08:52.798 --> 00:08:54.133
SORRY I I KEPT A FIDDLING WITH

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.269
IT -- SO ONE

00:08:56.335 --> 00:08:57.603
OF THE WAYS I THINK WE NEED TO

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.071
GET PEOPLE INTO TREATMENT IS TO

00:08:59.138 --> 00:08:59.872
ENGAGE WITH THE REST OF THE

00:08:59.939 --> 00:09:02.241
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND KINDLED

00:09:02.308 --> 00:09:03.809
ARE FULLER IT WILL TALK ABOUT

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:06.078
THE UP IN SMOKE SYSTEM WHICH

00:09:06.145 --> 00:09:06.445
TALKS WHICH IS.

00:09:06.512 --> 00:09:08.314
RELEVANT TO THAT --

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:10.950
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH AGAIN --

00:09:11.017 --> 00:09:11.751
FOR HAVING US AND FOR YOUR

00:09:11.817 --> 00:09:13.386
SUPPORT TOWARDS THESE EFFORTS TO

00:09:13.452 --> 00:09:14.320
INCREASE ACCESS TO TREATMENT FOR

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:16.122
OPIATE USE DISORDERS --

00:09:16.188 --> 00:09:17.590
AGAIN I'M CANDLES ARE FULLER AND

00:09:17.657 --> 00:09:19.392
THE PROJECT DIRECTOR FOR UCLA'S

00:09:19.458 --> 00:09:21.827
EVALUATION OF THE CALIFORNIA HUB

00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:23.362
AND SPOKE PROGRAM.

00:09:23.429 --> 00:09:24.397
THE HAVEN'T SPOKE PROGRAM IS

00:09:24.463 --> 00:09:25.765
BASED ON AN INNOVATIVE MODEL OUT

00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:27.867
OF VERMONT TO EXPAND ACCESS TO

00:09:27.934 --> 00:09:29.835
MEDICATIONS FOR OPIOID USE

00:09:29.902 --> 00:09:30.336
DISORDERS WHICH INCLUDE

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:31.404
METHADONE.

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.606
BUPRENORPHINE AND THAT THE TRIAL --

00:09:33.673 --> 00:09:35.274
BUT THE FOCUS OF THIS APPROACH

00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:37.343
IS REALLY ON BUPRENORPHINE --

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.845
BECAUSE IS DARREN WAS MENTIONING --

00:09:39.912 --> 00:09:42.248
THE MODEL IS DESIGNED TO REACH

00:09:42.315 --> 00:09:44.817
THINGS WHO MAY NOT HAVE A LOCAL

00:09:44.884 --> 00:09:46.052
METHADONE OPIATE TREATMENT

00:09:46.118 --> 00:09:47.787
PROGRAM NEARBY --

00:09:47.853 --> 00:09:49.989
LIKE THOSE IN RURAL AREAS OR

00:09:50.056 --> 00:09:52.425
OTHER UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES --

00:09:52.491 --> 00:09:53.259
EVEN WORKING CAN BE PRESCRIBED

00:09:53.326 --> 00:09:53.793
IN OFFICE SPACE TREATMENT

00:09:53.859 --> 00:09:55.161
SETTINGS LIKE PRIMARY CARE

00:09:55.227 --> 00:09:56.262
OFFICES.

00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:58.397
BY PRACTITIONERS HAVE GOTTEN A

00:09:58.464 --> 00:10:00.633
SAM'S A WAIVER TO PRESCRIBE IT --

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.268
SO IN THE MODEL SPECIALTY OPIOID

00:10:02.335 --> 00:10:03.970
TREATMENT PROGRAMS OR HUBS

00:10:04.036 --> 00:10:05.571
CONNECT WITH --

00:10:05.638 --> 00:10:07.606
OFFICE SPACE SETTINGS FOLKS TO

00:10:07.673 --> 00:10:08.607
OFFER GUIDANCE IN TREATING

00:10:08.674 --> 00:10:10.543
OPIOID USE DISORDERS AND TO

00:10:10.609 --> 00:10:11.944
SERVE AS REFERRAL SITES FOR

00:10:12.011 --> 00:10:14.347
PATIENTS WHO NEED A MORE

00:10:14.413 --> 00:10:16.449
INTENSIVE LEVEL OF CARE --

00:10:16.515 --> 00:10:17.950
THIS ALL REQUIRES BUILDING NEW

00:10:18.017 --> 00:10:19.819
AFFILIATIONS AND CARE COR

00:10:19.885 --> 00:10:21.620
NATION'S BETWEEN OTP AN OFFICE

00:10:21.687 --> 00:10:23.289
SPACE SETTINGS --

00:10:23.356 --> 00:10:24.757
AND CALIFORNIA HAS REALLY BEEN

00:10:24.824 --> 00:10:27.326
LEADING THE WAY IN IMPLEMENTING

00:10:27.393 --> 00:10:29.261
THIS HUB AND SPOKE MODEL --

00:10:29.328 --> 00:10:30.696
SO JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF

00:10:30.763 --> 00:10:32.164
WHAT THE NETWORK LOOKS LIKE AND

00:10:32.231 --> 00:10:33.666
HOW IS IT HOW IT'S GROWN OVER

00:10:33.733 --> 00:10:34.834
TIME --

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:35.801
WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF MAPS THE

00:10:35.868 --> 00:10:38.104
FIRST SHOWS THE NETWORK WHEN THE

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:39.805
PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION STARTED

00:10:39.872 --> 00:10:43.476
IN HUBS AND SPOKES AND AUGUST.

00:10:43.542 --> 00:10:44.043
TWENTY SEVENTEEN AT THE TIME

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:45.344
THERE WERE FIFTY SEVEN FOLKS

00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:47.179
AMONG THE EIGHTEEN HAVEN'T SPOKE

00:10:47.246 --> 00:10:48.614
NETWORKS.

00:10:48.681 --> 00:10:51.017
AND BY JANUARY TWENTY NINETEEN

00:10:51.083 --> 00:10:52.418
THERE WERE OVER TWO HUNDRED

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:54.320
SPOKE TREATMENT LOCATIONS --

00:10:54.387 --> 00:10:56.088
A MAJORITY OF WHICH WERE LOCATED

00:10:56.155 --> 00:10:57.189
UP IN THOSE RURAL NORTHERN

00:10:57.256 --> 00:10:58.491
COUNTIES --

00:10:58.557 --> 00:10:59.592
WHICH HAVE EXPERIENCED AGAIN

00:10:59.658 --> 00:11:01.627
THOSE HIGHEST OVERDOSE DEATH

00:11:01.694 --> 00:11:03.162
RATES -- SO

00:11:03.229 --> 00:11:04.163
IN THE NEXT FEW SLIDES WE HAVE

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.265
SOME PRELIMINARY DATA ON THE

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:07.466
NUMBERS OF PATIENTS AND

00:11:07.533 --> 00:11:09.135
PROVIDERS IN THE HUB AND SPOKE

00:11:09.201 --> 00:11:11.370
NETWORK.

00:11:11.437 --> 00:11:12.772
SO HERE YOU'LL SEE DATA THAT

00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:13.205
UCLA --

00:11:13.272 --> 00:11:14.140
COLLECTED FROM ALL HUBS AND

00:11:14.206 --> 00:11:15.875
SPOKES ON THE NUMBERS OF NEW

00:11:15.941 --> 00:11:17.276
PATIENTS STARTING ALL THREE

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:19.678
MEDICATIONS EACH MONTH DATING

00:11:19.745 --> 00:11:21.514
BACK TO SEVEN MONTHS PRIOR TO

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.182
IMPLEMENTATION.

00:11:23.249 --> 00:11:25.184
SO OVER THAT BASELINE PERIOD

00:11:25.251 --> 00:11:27.186
BEFORE THE DOTTED LINE THERE --

00:11:27.253 --> 00:11:27.787
WE'VE SEEN GROWTH BOTH IN THE

00:11:27.853 --> 00:11:31.257
OVER OF PATIENTS STARTING

00:11:31.323 --> 00:11:32.792
TREATMENT --

00:11:32.858 --> 00:11:34.727
BUT ALSO WHAT'S REALLY GREAT

00:11:34.794 --> 00:11:36.095
HERE -- IS

00:11:36.162 --> 00:11:37.696
THERE'S BEEN A BIG UPTURN IN THE

00:11:37.763 --> 00:11:38.831
NUMBER OF PATIENTS RECEIVING

00:11:38.898 --> 00:11:40.733
BUPRENORPHINE WHICH IS THAT DARK

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.867
BLUE LINE THERE --

00:11:41.934 --> 00:11:43.636
JUMPING UP EVEN HIGHER THAN

00:11:43.702 --> 00:11:44.537
METHADONE --

00:11:44.603 --> 00:11:46.505
SO THAT DATA REALLY SPEAKS TO

00:11:46.572 --> 00:11:49.208
THE GROWTH IN THOSE SPOKE OFFICE

00:11:49.275 --> 00:11:51.911
BASED TREATMENT SETTINGS --

00:11:51.977 --> 00:11:53.479
WHICH IS DUE IN PART TO AN

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:54.747
INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF

00:11:54.814 --> 00:11:56.382
PROVIDERS --

00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:58.250
WEAVER TO PRESCRIBE ME PRINT ARE

00:11:58.317 --> 00:11:59.552
FEEDING.

00:11:59.618 --> 00:12:01.120
SO THIS IS SLIGHTLY OLDER DATA

00:12:01.187 --> 00:12:03.756
DATA FROM OCTOBER --

00:12:03.823 --> 00:12:04.557
BUT AGAIN WE'VE SEEN GROWTH IN

00:12:04.623 --> 00:12:07.126
THE OVERALL NUMBERS OF PROVIDERS --

00:12:07.193 --> 00:12:08.627
BUT WHAT YOU'LL ALSO SEE IS THAT

00:12:08.694 --> 00:12:10.496
THERE'S ACTUALLY A GAP --

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:12.465
AMONG THE SPOKE PROVIDERS WHO

00:12:12.531 --> 00:12:13.766
GET WAVERED AND THEN THOSE WHO

00:12:13.833 --> 00:12:15.334
ACTUALLY START PRESCRIBING SO

00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:16.569
THE NUMBER WHO GET LEVERAGES

00:12:16.635 --> 00:12:18.137
ALONG THE TOP PLAN THERE AND THE

00:12:18.204 --> 00:12:19.939
PERCENTAGES THOSE WHO ARE

00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:21.407
ACTIVELY PRESCRIBING DEEPER

00:12:21.474 --> 00:12:23.576
MORPHINE --

00:12:23.642 --> 00:12:25.845
SO WHEN WE SURVEYED HAVEN'T

00:12:25.911 --> 00:12:27.680
SPOKE PROVIDERS ABOUT THEIR

00:12:27.746 --> 00:12:28.948
PRESCRIBING PRACTICES.

00:12:29.014 --> 00:12:30.883
THOSE WHO WERE WAVERED BUT HAD

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:32.051
NEVER PRESCRIBE PEOPLE ARE BEING

00:12:32.118 --> 00:12:33.786
WERE LESS LIKELY THAN THOSE

00:12:33.853 --> 00:12:34.920
ACTIVE PRESCRIBERS TO FEEL THAT

00:12:34.987 --> 00:12:36.622
THEY HAD THE MENTORSHIP THEY

00:12:36.689 --> 00:12:38.224
NEEDED TO PRESCRIBE.

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:39.892
OTHER BARRIERS THAT CAME UP IN

00:12:39.959 --> 00:12:40.759
THE SURVEYS AND IN OTHER

00:12:40.826 --> 00:12:43.462

00:12:47.666 --> 00:12:48.968
STIGMA TOWARDS OPIOID USE

00:12:49.034 --> 00:12:49.835
DISORDERS.

00:12:49.902 --> 00:12:51.604
ACCESS ACCESS TO COUNSELING

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.772

PRIMARY CARE PATIENTS AND FEARS

00:12:55.674 --> 00:12:57.710
ABOUT THE POTENTIAL LEGAL

00:12:57.776 --> 00:12:59.745
CONSEQUENCES OF PRESCRIBING --

00:12:59.812 --> 00:13:00.646
TO ADDRESS THE GAP IN

00:13:00.713 --> 00:13:02.815
PRESCRIBING UCLA HAS WORKED WITH

00:13:02.882 --> 00:13:04.583
A GROUP AT STANFORD TO DEVELOP

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.352
THE HUB AND SPOKE PROVIDER

SUBMITTED IMPLEMENTATION PLANS

00:14:29.935 --> 00:14:31.036
NOT ALL OF THEM GONE LIFE I

00:14:31.103 --> 00:14:32.304

BEGAN THEN.

00:14:43.616 --> 00:14:46.585
THAT WOULD ADD UP 297% OF OF THE

00:14:46.652 --> 00:14:47.419
POPULATION LIVING IN THOSE

00:14:47.486 --> 00:14:51.657

00:14:56.462 --> 00:14:59.231
I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY IF ALL

00:14:59.298 --> 00:14:59.865
FORTY OUT OF FORTY WILL WILL GO

00:14:59.932 --> 00:15:02.935

AND SO THERE SO HE SAID THEY'RE

00:15:04.903 --> 00:15:07.172
CURRENTLY EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN

00:15:07.239 --> 00:15:08.240
COUNTIES --

00:15:08.307 --> 00:15:10.409
BUT THE MOST IT MY IMPRESSION IS

00:15:10.476 --> 00:15:11.644
THAT MOSTLY THE ONES THAT HAVE

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:13.979
ADOPTED IN A RURAL COUNTIES

00:15:14.046 --> 00:15:15.247
RIGHT WELL THAT YEAH YEAH THE

00:15:15.314 --> 00:15:16.715
SMALL COUNTIES.

00:15:16.782 --> 00:15:18.017
YEAH SO.

00:15:18.083 --> 00:15:19.485
HOW DO WE HOW DO WE CHANGE THAT

00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:23.422
YEAH THAT'S? FOR FOR VERY SMALL

00:15:23.489 --> 00:15:27.693
COUNTIES HONESTLY I I'M NOT SURE.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.328
WELL ONE OF THE EFFORT THAT'S

00:15:29.395 --> 00:15:29.995
GOING ON RIGHT NOW IS TO DO

00:15:30.062 --> 00:15:31.397
REGIONAL MODEL SO --

00:15:31.463 --> 00:15:32.531
SEVERAL SMALL COUNTIES ARE

00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:33.999
WORKING WITH PARTNERSHIP HEALTH

00:15:34.066 --> 00:15:36.535
PLAN -- TO

00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:37.736
HE TRIED TRY TO WORK OUT

00:15:37.803 --> 00:15:38.537
SOMETHING WHERE THEY DON'T

00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:39.738
NECESSARILY HAVE TO ALL HAVE TO

00:15:39.805 --> 00:15:41.006
HAVE THE FULL CONTINUUM OF CARE

00:15:41.073 --> 00:15:42.308
BUT THEY CAN REFER TO ANOTHER

00:15:42.374 --> 00:15:45.044
PEOPLE TO ANOTHER COUNTY.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:46.879
SO THAT'S PROMISING --

00:15:46.945 --> 00:15:48.013
IT THE THERE'VE BEEN

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.783
DIFFICULTIES AS A IT HASN'T

00:15:50.849 --> 00:15:53.352
STARTED YET BUT I'M NOT.

00:15:53.419 --> 00:15:54.453
I'M NOT DEEPLY INVOLVED EXACTLY

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.688
KNOWING WHY I KNOW IT'S A

00:15:55.754 --> 00:15:57.189
COMPLICATED THING TO SET UP THE

00:15:57.256 --> 00:15:58.123
HOPEFULLY THEY WILL BE ABLE TO

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:00.125
GET THAT RUNNING AND THAT COULD

00:16:00.192 --> 00:16:00.726
SERVE AS A MODEL FOR THE SMALL

00:16:00.793 --> 00:16:01.694
COUNTIES.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:06.565
THERE MAY HONESTLY BE SOME --

00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:08.133
THE IF YOU'RE ALPINE COUNTY OF

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.669
POPULATION OF ELEVEN HUNDRED AND

00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:11.170
YOU HAVE A MINIMUM BASE

00:16:11.236 --> 00:16:12.971
ALLOCATION OF THE MONEY THAT'S

00:16:13.038 --> 00:16:14.440
COMING TO FOR TREATMENT THROUGH

00:16:14.506 --> 00:16:16.208
OTHERS DAVIS OF THE OTHER OTHER

00:16:16.275 --> 00:16:17.209
FUNDING SOURCES.

00:16:17.276 --> 00:16:18.544
AND YOU'VE GOT ONE OR TWO PEOPLE

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:20.012
MAYBE THAT'LL PRESENT FOR

00:16:20.079 --> 00:16:22.348
TREATMENTEACH MONTH I'M NOT

00:16:22.414 --> 00:16:23.415
SURE HOW THAT'S WORDS WITH --

00:16:23.482 --> 00:16:25.684
YOU KNOW EVER BEING ABLE TO

00:16:25.751 --> 00:16:28.587
REACH ALL THE GMC ODS --

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:30.556
REQUIREMENTS.

00:16:30.622 --> 00:16:32.324
OF WHETHER THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE

00:16:32.391 --> 00:16:34.193
IN TERMS OF JUST THE TIME AND

00:16:34.259 --> 00:16:35.894
EFFORT I I DO THINK YOU KNOW

00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:37.463
THEY COULD BENEFIT FROM IT BUT

00:16:37.529 --> 00:16:39.465
IT'S IT'S IT'S GONNA BE I MEAN

00:16:39.531 --> 00:16:40.065
THEY WOULD GET INCREASED RATES

00:16:40.132 --> 00:16:41.066
IN.

00:16:41.133 --> 00:16:42.634
THE BILL THE BILL FOR THINGS --

00:16:42.701 --> 00:16:43.569
THAT THEY OTHERWISE COULDN'T BE

00:16:43.635 --> 00:16:45.671
BUT IF IF THEY JUST DON'T FEEL

00:16:45.738 --> 00:16:48.440
THAT THEY THEY NEED IT BECAUSE

00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:49.074
OF THE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT

00:16:49.141 --> 00:16:49.875
THEY HAVE.

00:16:49.942 --> 00:16:52.678
IT THAT THERE MIGHT BE A A A A A

00:16:52.745 --> 00:16:54.680
POINT WHERE.

00:16:54.747 --> 00:16:55.581
THOSE KINDS COUNTIES MIGHT NOT

00:16:55.647 --> 00:16:57.149
PARTICIPATE I DON'T KNOW.

00:16:57.216 --> 00:16:59.952
SO IT ARE YOU FIND ARE WE NOT

00:17:00.018 --> 00:17:01.153
DONE WANTED OVER GENERALIZED

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.956
REFINING AND SOME OF THE SOME OF

00:17:04.022 --> 00:17:05.491
THOSE SMALLER COUNTIES AT THEIR

00:17:05.557 --> 00:17:06.759
THERE IS A DENIAL OF MAYBE

00:17:06.825 --> 00:17:08.427
THERE'S A PROBLEM OR OR THERE'S

00:17:08.494 --> 00:17:10.429
A RELUCTANCE BECAUSE FOR FOR

00:17:10.496 --> 00:17:11.964
WHATEVER REASON TO ENGAGE IN

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:12.998
THIS -- I

00:17:13.065 --> 00:17:16.969
REPRESENT THREE COUNTIES THAT

00:17:17.035 --> 00:17:18.437
HAVE BEEN REALLY REALLY HARD YET.

00:17:18.504 --> 00:17:20.839
AND I SEE UP THERE THAT YOU KNOW

00:17:20.906 --> 00:17:22.875
ONE OF THEM HAS A I SPOKE I SAW

00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:24.543
ON THE ON THE BORDER BETWEEN

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:25.911
TRINITY AND MENACING OR TRAINING

00:17:25.978 --> 00:17:28.380
HUMBLE --

00:17:28.447 --> 00:17:30.115
BUT WE YOU KNOW.

00:17:30.182 --> 00:17:31.617
I CAN YEP RIGHT THERE YEAH

00:17:31.683 --> 00:17:33.118
THAT'S RIGHT THERE IN THE IN

00:17:33.185 --> 00:17:35.220
THAT MENDOCINO HUMBLE REST

00:17:35.287 --> 00:17:36.655
ACTUALLY HUMBLE TRINITY AREA.

00:17:36.722 --> 00:17:37.956
AND WE HAVE SOME I HAVE A HUGE

00:17:38.023 --> 00:17:39.958
CHALLENGES AND AND AND HUMBOLDT

00:17:40.025 --> 00:17:41.527
COUNTY AS WELL SO.

00:17:41.593 --> 00:17:43.495
SO -- IS IT

00:17:43.562 --> 00:17:46.799
IS IT IS IT THE PAPER WORK IS IT

00:17:46.865 --> 00:17:47.566
IS IT.

00:17:47.633 --> 00:17:49.601
IS IT THE IS IT THE THE

00:17:49.668 --> 00:17:50.769
ACCEPTANCE THAT THERE'S A

00:17:50.836 --> 00:17:52.271
PROBLEM.

00:17:52.337 --> 00:17:52.871
I'M I'M TRYING TO GET TO THE

00:17:52.938 --> 00:17:54.740
ROOT YEAH AND AND SO WHEN YOU

00:17:54.807 --> 00:17:58.210
SAY YOU WERE GOING TO GET 27097%.

00:17:58.277 --> 00:18:00.412
WHAT'S THE 3% THE WON'T BE

00:18:00.479 --> 00:18:01.780
COVERED IS THAT GONNA BE IS THAT

00:18:01.847 --> 00:18:06.752
GONNA BE RURAL COUNTIES BECAUSE

00:18:06.819 --> 00:18:08.253
PROBABLY WHERE WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.455
SO HOW DO WE AS A WHEN I THINK

00:18:09.521 --> 00:18:10.989
OF THAT WHEN I HEAR 97% PERCENT

00:18:11.056 --> 00:18:11.990
I THINK OF HIS BROADBAND.

00:18:12.057 --> 00:18:13.826
OKAY THE RACES BROADBAND WE HAVE

00:18:13.892 --> 00:18:15.727
97% COVERED WILL GUESS WHERE

00:18:15.794 --> 00:18:17.496
THAT 3% DOES HAVE COVERAGES.

00:18:17.563 --> 00:18:19.064
IN MY COUNTIES.

00:18:19.131 --> 00:18:23.836
ON EXCEPT 7% WHERE IS THE 3% IS

00:18:23.902 --> 00:18:25.237
IT IS IT ALL IN RURAL COUNTIES

00:18:25.304 --> 00:18:27.005
AND IF IT IS HOW DO WE GET THE

00:18:27.072 --> 00:18:29.274
PENETRATION TO MAKE TO MAKE THIS

00:18:29.341 --> 00:18:29.475
WORK.

00:18:29.541 --> 00:18:31.610
RIGHT --

00:18:31.677 --> 00:18:33.679
WELL IT IT'S IT'S IT PROBABLY IS

00:18:33.745 --> 00:18:35.981
THE RURAL COUNTIES AND TO SOME

00:18:36.048 --> 00:18:37.449
EXTENT IT MIGHT BE.

00:18:37.516 --> 00:18:39.451
ON ON TO SPECULATE BEYOND THE

00:18:39.518 --> 00:18:41.587
DATA THAT PERHAPS BUT TO SET UP

00:18:41.653 --> 00:18:44.156
A A RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM OR AND

00:18:44.223 --> 00:18:45.424
NARCOTIC TREATMENT PROGRAM YOU

00:18:45.491 --> 00:18:47.259
NEED CERTAIN NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO

00:18:47.326 --> 00:18:48.126
BE ABLE TO PUT IN THERE TO MAKE

00:18:48.193 --> 00:18:49.895
IT.

00:18:49.962 --> 00:18:51.964
ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE.

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.332
OF THE SET UP COUNTY PROGRAM --

00:18:53.398 --> 00:18:54.967
BUT YOU KNOW IT'S IT IT THEN IT

00:18:55.033 --> 00:18:57.369
BECOMES A MATTER OF RESOURCES --

00:18:57.436 --> 00:18:59.104
THINGS LIKE HUB AND SPOKE I

00:18:59.171 --> 00:18:59.805
THINK.

00:18:59.872 --> 00:19:01.807
MIGHT BE PROMISING AND THAT YOU

00:19:01.874 --> 00:19:03.475
DON'T HAVE TO SET UP A SPECIALTY

00:19:03.542 --> 00:19:05.110
CARE PROGRAM --

00:19:05.177 --> 00:19:06.879
BILLS COUNTIES.

00:19:06.945 --> 00:19:07.880
HAVE.

00:19:07.946 --> 00:19:08.847
YOU KNOW MAXIS PRIMARY CARE IF

00:19:08.914 --> 00:19:10.115
YOU HAVE A FEDERALLY QUALIFIED

00:19:10.182 --> 00:19:11.550
HEALTH CENTER OR SOMETHING LIKE

00:19:11.617 --> 00:19:14.419
THAT AND CAN CAN --

00:19:14.486 --> 00:19:15.587
INTEGRATE BEEPING OFF --

00:19:15.654 --> 00:19:18.957
INTO THAT THAT MIGHT BE.

00:19:19.024 --> 00:19:20.592
I I ACTUALLY THINK --

00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:21.093
THAT'S A GOOD SOLUTION

00:19:21.159 --> 00:19:23.328
EVERYWHERE BUT ESPECIALLY AND

00:19:23.395 --> 00:19:25.130
AND OF WORLD --

00:19:25.197 --> 00:19:29.368
COUNTIES. 90% 995% OF PEOPLE WHO --

00:19:29.434 --> 00:19:29.968
DON'T GET TREATMENT THEY DON'T

00:19:30.035 --> 00:19:33.872
GET IT A PROBLEM SO BUT 85% OF

00:19:33.939 --> 00:19:35.607
AMERICANS HAVE SOME INTERACTION

00:19:35.674 --> 00:19:37.009
WITH THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM EVERY

00:19:37.075 --> 00:19:38.877
YEAR SO.

00:19:38.944 --> 00:19:40.078
THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE GOING LET'S

00:19:40.145 --> 00:19:42.247
LET'S LET'S ENGAGE IN THERE I

00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:42.881
THINK AND I THINK THEIR WAYS TO

00:19:42.948 --> 00:19:43.982
DO THAT.

00:19:44.049 --> 00:19:45.918
SO I YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY HELP

00:19:45.984 --> 00:19:47.319
PARTNERSHIP IS A BIG --

00:19:47.386 --> 00:19:49.855
A BIG PART OF MY DISTRICT --

00:19:49.922 --> 00:19:51.723
AND AND SO THERE ARE

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:53.225
OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTNERSHIP TO

00:19:53.292 --> 00:19:54.993
ENGAGE MORE AYE AYE WELCOME I

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:55.727
WELCOME THAT.

00:19:55.794 --> 00:19:57.229
SO I DO WONDER SO WHEN YOU TALK

00:19:57.296 --> 00:19:59.498
ABOUT THE THE PROVIDERS NOW THAT

00:19:59.565 --> 00:20:00.966
HAVE -- HAVE

00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:02.034
THE TRAINING TO BE ABLE TO

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:05.604
PRESCRIBE ANY OF 69% UPTAKE.

00:20:05.671 --> 00:20:07.639
SO THE 31%.

00:20:07.706 --> 00:20:09.107
WHERE ARE THEY ARE THOSE ARE

00:20:09.174 --> 00:20:11.143
THOSE ALSO RURAL --

00:20:11.209 --> 00:20:12.578
DO THEY NOT FEEL THEY HAVE A

00:20:12.644 --> 00:20:14.279
SUPPORTER OF THE OR THE OR THE

00:20:14.346 --> 00:20:15.981
OR THE BACKGROUND.

00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:17.649
ARE THOSE ARE THOSE --

00:20:17.716 --> 00:20:18.650
FOLKS THAT --

00:20:18.717 --> 00:20:20.085
MAYBE OUR PROVIDERS IN IN OUR

00:20:20.152 --> 00:20:22.354
TRIBAL COMMUNITIES WHERE WE HAVE

00:20:22.421 --> 00:20:23.989
THREE TIMES THE THE OVERDOSE

00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:25.357
RATE -- SO

00:20:25.424 --> 00:20:28.260
SO WHERE IS THAT 31% THAT'S NOT

00:20:28.327 --> 00:20:31.196
UTILIZING THE TRAINING THEY HAVE

00:20:31.263 --> 00:20:33.765
TO HELP WITH THE SITUATION.

00:20:33.832 --> 00:20:35.000
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION --

00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:37.369
I DON'T HAVE THAT DATA WITH ME

00:20:37.436 --> 00:20:38.403
NOW -- MY

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:39.705
SENSE IT'S IT'S IT'S PRETTY

00:20:39.771 --> 00:20:41.506
WIDESPREAD BUT YOU COULD BE

00:20:41.573 --> 00:20:44.176
CORRECT THAT IT IS IN THOSE --

00:20:44.242 --> 00:20:46.979
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE HARDEST WE

00:20:47.045 --> 00:20:47.913
DO HAVE THE PRACTICE

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.015
FACILITATORS WORKING IN ALL OF

00:20:50.082 --> 00:20:51.683
THE REGIONS OF THE HUB AND SPOKE

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:53.118
NETWORK --

00:20:53.185 --> 00:20:57.623
BUT AGAIN YOU COULD BE CORRECT.

00:20:57.689 --> 00:20:59.391
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE THE TO

00:20:59.458 --> 00:21:00.058
FOLLOW UP ON THAT THAT THAT BACK

00:21:00.125 --> 00:21:01.560
TO US BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO KNOW

00:21:01.627 --> 00:21:02.194
BECAUSE SOME OF THE COMMUNITIES

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:03.061
THAT ARE HARD TO SEE.

00:21:03.128 --> 00:21:04.763
AND WHILE THE NUMBERS MAY NOT BE

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.798
A BIG NUMBER COMPARED TO SOME

00:21:06.865 --> 00:21:07.933
LARGER COMMUNITIES

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.469
PROPORTIONALLY RATHER HIGH.

00:21:10.535 --> 00:21:12.337
ESPECIALLY IN OUR MORE ISOLATED

00:21:12.404 --> 00:21:13.505
COMMUNITIES IN OUR TRIBAL

00:21:13.572 --> 00:21:17.542
COMMUNITIES AND AND SO SO.

00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:18.543
I WANT TO BE THIS UP BUT I GO

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.212
BACK TO I THINK SOME F OUR

00:21:20.278 --> 00:21:21.146
HARDEST HIT AREAS WERE THE ONES

00:21:21.213 --> 00:21:21.980
THAT ARE.

00:21:22.047 --> 00:21:23.115
THAT ARE NOT SEEN THE

00:21:23.181 --> 00:21:24.583
PENETRATION OF WOULD LIKE TO SEE.

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.585
AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THAT'S

00:21:26.652 --> 00:21:29.855
WHAT I'M PUSHING FOR THANK YOU.

OF GOT AHEAD OF WHAT I WAS

00:21:37.229 --> 00:21:37.996
THINKING.

00:21:38.063 --> 00:21:39.765
WHEN I WAS READING THE RESEARCH

00:21:39.831 --> 00:21:41.566
THAT WAS PROVIDED IT DOES TALK

00:21:41.633 --> 00:21:43.168
ABOUT NATIVE AMERICANS BEING

00:21:43.235 --> 00:21:44.069
TWICE?

00:21:44.136 --> 00:21:45.671
I EXPENSIVE TWICE THE NUMBER OF

00:21:45.737 --> 00:21:47.673
DEATHS AS COMPARED TO WHITES AND

00:21:47.739 --> 00:21:48.573
I KNOW THAT WE NEED NO PEOPLE OF

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.509
COLOR USUALLY TEND TO HAVE

00:21:50.575 --> 00:21:53.278
HIGHER NUMBERS BUT THAT TO ME

00:21:53.345 --> 00:21:53.712

AS COMPARED TO LATINOS AND

00:22:10.495 --> 00:22:11.697
OTHERS.

THIS REPORT AND AT 17% --

00:23:33.645 --> 00:23:35.647
PER ONE THOUSAND A HUNDRED

00:23:35.714 --> 00:23:37.082
THOUSAND RESIDENTS IS FAR MORE

00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:39.417
HIGHER THAN SOME OF THE OTHER --

00:23:39.484 --> 00:23:41.319
SUB CATEGORIES THAT ARE THERE.

00:23:41.386 --> 00:23:42.888
NOW THE DIFFERENCE IN IN THE

00:23:42.954 --> 00:23:44.022
NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY WE'RE

00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:45.023

ARE LIVING ON INDIAN

00:23:47.893 --> 00:23:49.995
RESERVATIONS THE OUTRAGE IN

00:23:50.061 --> 00:23:51.496
FOCUS GROUPS IS GOING THERE YOU

00:23:51.563 --> 00:23:52.597
MENTIONED THAT --

00:23:52.664 --> 00:23:53.999
THERE'S BEEN SOME OUT REACH AS

00:23:54.065 --> 00:23:55.367
FAR AS TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS

00:23:55.433 --> 00:23:56.301
EPIDEMIC THAT'S FACING

00:23:56.368 --> 00:23:58.804
CALIFORNIA AND PARTICULARLY WE

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:01.072
SEE -- THE

00:24:01.139 --> 00:24:04.342
THE HIGHEST RATE.

00:24:04.409 --> 00:24:06.411
SO WE START TO TALK ABOUT --

00:24:06.478 --> 00:24:08.013
AREAS LATER ON IN THE AGENDA AS

00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:09.781
FAR AS HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO

00:24:09.848 --> 00:24:11.550
SOME INTERVENTION SOME IDEAS OF

00:24:11.616 --> 00:24:12.951
THOSE THINGS.

00:24:13.018 --> 00:24:14.452
HOW ARE WE REACHING OUT TO THE

00:24:14.519 --> 00:24:15.687
NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION

00:24:15.754 --> 00:24:17.956
KNOWING THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THE

00:24:18.023 --> 00:24:18.790
HIGHEST NATIVE AMERICAN

00:24:18.857 --> 00:24:20.425
POPULATION ANY OTHER STATE IN

00:24:20.492 --> 00:24:21.493
THE NATION?

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:22.727
AND DEALING AGAIN WITH URBAN

00:24:22.794 --> 00:24:23.562
URBAN --

00:24:23.628 --> 00:24:25.330
INDIANS THAT LIVE IN THE CITIES

00:24:25.397 --> 00:24:26.298
AND THOSE THAT ARE ACTUALLY ON

00:24:26.364 --> 00:24:27.866
FEDERAL INDIAN RESERVATIONS I

00:24:27.933 --> 00:24:30.435
THINK WE WE OWE T TO BRING THE

00:24:30.502 --> 00:24:31.203
STATISTICS.

00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:32.470
Là MUCH LOWER --

00:24:32.537 --> 00:24:33.905
EVEN IF WE BROUGHT IT TO WHERE

00:24:33.972 --> 00:24:36.208
OTHERS ARE AT BUT YET THERE HAS

00:24:36.274 --> 00:24:37.776
TO BE A HEIGHTENED AWARENESS TO

00:24:37.843 --> 00:24:38.844
IT EVEN IN THE DIFFERENT REPORTS

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:39.511
THAT ARE.

00:24:39.578 --> 00:24:41.379
COMING FORWARD SO HOW DO WE DEAL

00:24:41.446 --> 00:24:42.480
WITH THAT KNOWING THAT THERE'S

00:24:42.547 --> 00:24:43.682

THAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE RECEIVING

00:29:55.727 --> 00:29:57.128
TREATMENT ROSE 7%.

00:29:57.195 --> 00:29:59.364
BUT I LIKE TO KNOW LIKE WHAT IS

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:01.366
THE DENOMINATOR SO --

00:30:01.432 --> 00:30:03.768
SO AND I REALIZED MAYBE A LITTLE

00:30:03.835 --> 00:30:07.672
BIT SAVE ONLY SERVING 1% OF

00:30:07.739 --> 00:30:08.740
PEOPLE AND WE INCREASED BY 7%

00:30:08.806 --> 00:30:10.909
I'D GO.

00:30:10.975 --> 00:30:12.110
THAT'S STILL FAILURE RIGHT ARE

00:30:12.177 --> 00:30:14.312
WE SERVING 20% WE HAVE A SEVEN

00:30:14.379 --> 00:30:16.181
FRIEND SENT ENTRIES BECAUSE

00:30:16.247 --> 00:30:16.814
THERE'S A HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

00:30:16.881 --> 00:30:17.715

00:30:30.828 --> 00:30:32.330
STILL LIKE BELOW 50%.

00:30:32.397 --> 00:30:34.999
WERE FORMULA FAR BELOW OKAY SO

00:30:35.066 --> 00:30:36.668
7% OBVIOUSLY BETTER THAN NO

00:30:36.734 --> 00:30:37.835
INCREASE OF CERTAINLY BETTER

00:30:37.902 --> 00:30:40.038
DECREASE BUT NO WHERE NEAR THE

00:30:40.104 --> 00:30:41.706
KIND OF PROGRESS WE NEED TO MAKE.

00:30:41.773 --> 00:30:44.175
NOW IT'S WAR PROBABLY AROUND FOR

00:30:44.242 --> 00:30:46.945
A LITTLE OVER 4% --

00:30:47.011 --> 00:30:48.046
THAT'S THE PERCENT OF A

00:30:48.112 --> 00:30:49.480
PERCENTAGE OF THE NEED THAT'S

00:30:49.547 --> 00:30:52.483
OUT THERE NOW AS I SAID 95% OR

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:54.219
SO OF OF THE PEOPLE WHO.

00:30:54.285 --> 00:30:55.687
WE THINK NEED TREATMENT DON'T

00:30:55.753 --> 00:31:00.458
THINK THEY NAY TREATMENTS ALL I

00:31:00.525 --> 00:31:02.360
UNDERSTAND IT'LL LEAVE.

00:31:02.427 --> 00:31:03.461
SO FORGET FOR A 44% OF THE

00:31:03.528 --> 00:31:05.196
REMAINING 5% I GUESS THAT'S IN

00:31:05.263 --> 00:31:06.564
INCENSE GOOD BUT THAT'S WHY WE

00:31:06.631 --> 00:31:07.198
WE NEED WE DO NEED TO GET DRILL

00:31:07.265 --> 00:31:09.400
INTO THAT 95% GET THEM.

00:31:09.467 --> 00:31:11.069
INTO TREATMENT YEAH SITES I JUST

00:31:11.135 --> 00:31:11.636
WEIGHING KNOWLEDGE I MEAN.

00:31:11.703 --> 00:31:12.170
I'M NOT SAYING PEOPLE ARE

00:31:12.237 --> 00:31:14.072
WORKING REALLY HARD BUT WE'RE A

00:31:14.138 --> 00:31:14.973
LONG WAY FROM SOLVING THE

00:31:15.039 --> 00:31:15.607
PROBLEM.

00:31:15.673 --> 00:31:17.208
YES AND THEN I APPRECIATE YOU

00:31:17.275 --> 00:31:18.576
SAID 93% OF THE PATIENTS

00:31:18.643 --> 00:31:20.144
RESEARCH EVEN POSITIVELY BUT

00:31:20.211 --> 00:31:21.779
GIVEN THE FACT YEAH USUALLY THE

00:31:21.846 --> 00:31:23.147
PEOPLE WHO DON'T RATE A POSITIVE

00:31:23.214 --> 00:31:24.148
AREN'T THE ONES ARE STICKING

00:31:24.215 --> 00:31:26.184
AROUND FOR THE SURVEY RIGHT SO I

00:31:26.251 --> 00:31:29.220
MEAN IT'S OF THOSE YEAH NO THAT

00:31:29.287 --> 00:31:31.889
93% OF THE RIGHT.

00:31:31.956 --> 00:31:33.591
WHAT SO WHAT WE DO IS WE HAVE

00:31:33.658 --> 00:31:34.726
THEM -- AS

00:31:34.792 --> 00:31:36.427
GREAT POINT I COULD I COULD TELL

00:31:36.494 --> 00:31:40.531
YOU ARE RESEARCH I I LIKE THAT --

00:31:40.598 --> 00:31:41.933
WOULD SERVE THE THESE ARE NOT A

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.401
SURVEYS ARE GIVEN OUT DURING

THAT CERTAIN WEEK IN IN --

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:48.306
SO IF IF THAT WAS OUR FIRST DAY

00:31:48.373 --> 00:31:49.974
THEY WOULD STILL GET IT.

00:31:50.041 --> 00:31:52.810
NOW THE PEOPLE THAT WE DON'T GET

00:31:52.877 --> 00:31:54.746
OF OUR YOU KNOW PEOPLE NEVER

00:31:54.812 --> 00:31:56.781
MADE INTO TREATMENT AND I GUESS

00:31:56.848 --> 00:31:57.415
IF THEY DROP OUT OF TREATMENT

00:31:57.482 --> 00:31:59.550
AND THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO MISS

00:31:59.617 --> 00:32:00.952
THAT WEEK I GUESS SO.

00:32:01.019 --> 00:32:02.153

WRITING PROGRAM I THINK SOME OF

00:32:06.257 --> 00:32:07.458
THE QUESTIONS WE NEED TO ASK

00:32:07.525 --> 00:32:08.226
THEN IS HOW DO YOU REACH THE

00:32:08.293 --> 00:32:10.528
OTHER PEOPLE I REALIZE IT'S

00:32:10.595 --> 00:32:12.797
DIFFICULT BUT THE A WORD WORD.

00:32:12.864 --> 00:32:14.265
WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO OKAY.

00:32:14.332 --> 00:32:21.105

00:32:36.821 --> 00:32:38.222
WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT TO TALK

00:32:38.289 --> 00:32:38.756
ABOUT THIS EXPERIENCE THE

00:32:38.823 --> 00:32:40.325
PROGRAM BUT TO WHAT DEGREE HE

00:32:40.391 --> 00:32:42.126
DOES A SPOKE DEPENDING WHERE IT

00:32:42.193 --> 00:32:43.161

MAY NEED TO BE A LOT MORE HELP

00:32:44.762 --> 00:32:46.364
LIKE BECAUSE THE HUB IS SO FAR

00:32:46.431 --> 00:32:48.366

USE SERVICES I THANK THE STATE

00:50:33.797 --> 00:50:36.233
HAS EVER SEEN IS FANTASTIC.

00:50:36.299 --> 00:50:37.901
THE BREADTH OF THE CONTINUING IS

00:50:37.968 --> 00:50:39.336
FANTASTIC.

00:50:39.403 --> 00:50:40.871
HAVING SAID THAT WE HAVEN'T

00:50:40.937 --> 00:50:43.106
SOLVED THE ACCESS PROBLEM YET.

00:50:43.173 --> 00:50:45.175
SOME OF THE EARLIER DISCUSSIONS

00:50:45.242 --> 00:50:48.545
WERE POINTING OUT 97% COVERAGE

00:50:48.612 --> 00:50:50.447
OF THE MEDI CAL POPULATION DOES

00:50:50.514 --> 00:50:54.017
NOT MEAN 967% ACCESS OF THOSE

00:50:54.084 --> 00:50:58.021
WHO NEED ASH JUDY GET S. U. D.

00:50:58.088 --> 00:51:00.824
SERVICES --

00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:01.358
RESIDENTIAL SERVICES --

00:51:01.425 --> 00:51:02.726
WHILE THERE'S BEEN TREMENDOUS

00:51:02.793 --> 00:51:06.897
GROWTH WE NEED A THIRD ROW THAT --

00:51:06.963 --> 00:51:08.098
CAPACITY --

00:51:08.165 --> 00:51:10.100
AND THAT'S NOT AN EASY TASK TO

00:51:10.167 --> 00:51:11.968
DO SPECIALLY UNDER THE COST

00:51:12.035 --> 00:51:13.537
BASED REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM

00:51:13.603 --> 00:51:14.571
THERE'S NO WAY.

00:51:14.638 --> 00:51:17.374
TO HAVE A SURPLUS TO REINVEST IN

00:51:17.441 --> 00:51:18.742
THAT KIND OF EXPANSION --

00:51:18.809 --> 00:51:21.077
SO WE WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT A

00:51:21.144 --> 00:51:23.580
FURTHER --

00:51:23.647 --> 00:51:26.383
UP ONE OF THE GREATEST --

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:28.518
ITEMS THAT HAMSTRING OUR ABILITY

00:51:28.585 --> 00:51:31.655
TO INCREASE ACCESS IS WORK FORCE

00:51:31.721 --> 00:51:32.622
YOU FOR TO TOUCH LONG --

00:51:32.689 --> 00:51:34.291
WE WE ARE IN A SORT OF A CRISIS

00:51:34.357 --> 00:51:36.159
STATE WITH THE WORK FORCE RESCUE

00:51:36.226 --> 00:51:37.427
DO SERVICES.

00:51:37.494 --> 00:51:39.062
THAT USED TO BE THAT THE ONLY

00:51:39.129 --> 00:51:41.598
FOLKS THAT WANTED AN ISSUE THE

00:51:41.665 --> 00:51:43.033
OF SOMEONE WORKING IN THE ISSUE

00:51:43.099 --> 00:51:45.769
THE FIELD THAT WAS CERTIFIED.

00:51:45.836 --> 00:51:47.471
WAS THE ISSUE THE PROVIDER --

00:51:47.537 --> 00:51:49.105
TODAY EVERYBODY WANTS THEM

00:51:49.172 --> 00:51:51.408
HEALTH PLANS WANT THEM HOSPITALS

00:51:51.475 --> 00:51:52.509
WANT THEM --

00:51:52.576 --> 00:51:54.344
SCHOOLS WANT THEM --

00:51:54.411 --> 00:51:55.779
AND OF COURSE A MENTAL HEALTH

00:51:55.846 --> 00:52:00.884
WANTS THEM AND OF COURSE WE NEED

00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:03.620
THEM IN THE SUBSTANCE USE REAL --

00:52:03.687 --> 00:52:04.554
THIS SO IT IT IS IN A CRISIS

00:52:04.621 --> 00:52:05.589
STATE OR WE BELIEVE WE NEED A

00:52:05.655 --> 00:52:07.023
SINGLE STATE AGENCY TO HANDLE

00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:08.458
CERTIFICATION.

00:52:08.525 --> 00:52:11.528
I AM PERHAPS LICENSURE OF NG

00:52:11.595 --> 00:52:12.929
THAT ON TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR

00:52:12.996 --> 00:52:14.731
HAS NOT BEEN A VERY POSITIVE

00:52:14.798 --> 00:52:16.900
THING OVERALL WE HAD TEN

00:52:16.967 --> 00:52:18.602
INITIALLY CERTIFYING

00:52:18.668 --> 00:52:19.769
ORGANIZATIONS.

00:52:19.836 --> 00:52:22.939
UP UNTIL YESTERDAY WE WERE DOWN

00:52:23.006 --> 00:52:24.708
TO TWO OF THE DEPARTMENT

00:52:24.774 --> 00:52:26.743
FORTUNATELY APPROVED THE

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:28.945
REINSTATEMENT OF A THIRD SO

00:52:29.012 --> 00:52:30.780
WE'RE BACK UP --

00:52:30.847 --> 00:52:32.482
TO THREE BUT IT'S IT'S JUST IT'S

00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:34.618
NOT ADEQUATE IT'S GOT ALL KINDS

00:52:34.684 --> 00:52:36.386
OF PROBLEMS WE THINK CAN BE

00:52:36.453 --> 00:52:38.522
FIXED THROUGH A SINGLE STATE

00:52:38.588 --> 00:52:39.956
AGENCY OVERSIGHT.

00:52:40.023 --> 00:52:42.192
AND HOPE TO WORK WITH SOME A FEW

00:52:42.259 --> 00:52:44.160
OF GOING FORWARD TO TRY TO

00:52:44.227 --> 00:52:46.763
ADDRESS THE RECOVERY SUPPORT

00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:48.398
SERVICES WHICH ARE A BENEFIT

00:52:48.465 --> 00:52:52.869
UNDER THE NEW ODS SYSTEM.

00:52:52.936 --> 00:52:54.738
A VERY IMPORTANT BENEFIT --

00:52:54.804 --> 00:52:56.473
WE THINK NEEDS FURTHER --

00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:59.843
DEFINITION AND SOME FURHER

00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:03.613
SUPPORT TO USE A WORK FORCE THAT

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.248
HAS LIVED EXPERIENCE.

00:53:05.315 --> 00:53:09.185
NOT CERTIFIED OR LICENSED KIND

00:53:09.252 --> 00:53:10.720
OF EXPERIENCE.

00:53:10.787 --> 00:53:12.255
THERE IS A PROCESS FOR THAT TO

00:53:12.322 --> 00:53:14.558
HAPPEN BUT IT REQUIRES COUNTIES

00:53:14.624 --> 00:53:17.227
IN THEIR PLANS TO IDENTIFY UP.

00:53:17.294 --> 00:53:21.364
A TRAINING PROGRAM --

00:53:21.431 --> 00:53:23.033
FOR WORK FORCE --

00:53:23.099 --> 00:53:25.101
AND MANY COUNTIES DON'T HAVE THE

00:53:25.168 --> 00:53:26.670
BAND WITH THE DO THAT SO THEY

00:53:26.736 --> 00:53:28.872
FALL BACK ON WE CAN DELIVER

00:53:28.939 --> 00:53:30.373
RECOVERY SUPPORT SERVICES SO

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:32.309
LONG SINCE OF REGISTERED OR

00:53:32.375 --> 00:53:33.710
CERTIFIED COUNSELOR OR A

00:53:33.777 --> 00:53:35.278
LICENSED PRACTITIONER THE

00:53:35.345 --> 00:53:36.546
HEALING ARTS.

00:53:36.613 --> 00:53:39.115
WHILE THAT PULLS WORK FORCE AWAY

00:53:39.182 --> 00:53:40.917
FROM THE COURT TREATMENT TO DO

00:53:40.984 --> 00:53:42.419
RECOVERY SUPPORT SERVICES

00:53:42.485 --> 00:53:44.821
FURTHER AGGRAVATING THAT PROBLEM

00:53:44.888 --> 00:53:45.989
AND WE THINK THAT.

00:53:46.056 --> 00:53:47.591
LIVED EXPERIENCE NEEDS TO BE

00:53:47.657 --> 00:53:49.392
RECOGNIZED AS PART OF RECOVERY

00:53:49.459 --> 00:53:52.028
SUPPORT AND HOPE TO HAVE MORE

00:53:52.095 --> 00:53:53.330
DIALOGUE ABOUT THAT.

00:53:53.396 --> 00:53:56.733
THERE ARE SOME SERIOUS.

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:58.268
ADMINISTRATIVE.

00:53:58.335 --> 00:54:00.036
BURDENS AS PART OF THE ORGANIZED

00:54:00.103 --> 00:54:01.338
DELIVERY SYSTEM.

00:54:01.404 --> 00:54:03.473
WE CAN'T GET AWAY FROM THEM ALL

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:04.841
SOME OF THEM ARE EXTREMELY

00:54:04.908 --> 00:54:07.777
IMPORTANT BUT SOME OF THEM WE

00:54:07.844 --> 00:54:09.079
CAN BE SMARTER ABOUT --

00:54:09.145 --> 00:54:10.947
DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

00:54:11.014 --> 00:54:12.983
AROUND MEDICAL NECESSITY AND

00:54:13.049 --> 00:54:14.351
ASSESSMENT THE REST OF THAT.

00:54:14.417 --> 00:54:17.053
WITH MUCH MORE STANDARDIZATION

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:18.588
AT THE STATE LEVEL.

00:54:18.655 --> 00:54:20.523
SO THAT EACH AND EVERY COUNTY

00:54:20.590 --> 00:54:21.992
DOESN'T DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT

00:54:22.058 --> 00:54:25.495
OR PILE ON TOP OF WE CAN GET

00:54:25.562 --> 00:54:28.131
SMARTER ABOUT THAT MINIMIZE THAT

00:54:28.198 --> 00:54:29.733
BURDEN ON THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY.

00:54:29.799 --> 00:54:31.835
SO THAT WORK FORCE CAN BE USE

00:54:31.901 --> 00:54:33.770
FOR WHAT IT'S THERE --

00:54:33.837 --> 00:54:35.205
FOR SOARING THE POPULATION.

00:54:35.271 --> 00:54:36.039
SO WE HOPE TO HAVE MORE

00:54:36.106 --> 00:54:39.242
DISCUSSION ABOUT WITH COUNTIES

00:54:39.309 --> 00:54:40.977
ON THE DEPARTMENT.

00:54:41.044 --> 00:54:43.213
THERE ARE THINGS LIKE YOU MUST

00:54:43.279 --> 00:54:45.548
CREDENTIAL STAFF SO THE PROVIDER

00:54:45.615 --> 00:54:47.417
STAFF HAVE TO BE CREDENTIALED BY

00:54:47.484 --> 00:54:49.419
THE QUOTE ON QUOTE HEALTH PLAN

00:54:49.486 --> 00:54:50.587
THAT'S THE COUNTY.

00:54:50.654 --> 00:54:52.956
WILL OF ONE COUNTY CREDENTIALS

00:54:53.023 --> 00:54:54.557
MY WORK FORCE.

00:54:54.624 --> 00:54:56.393
THAT SHOULD BE ACCEPTABLE FOR

00:54:56.459 --> 00:54:57.661
ANY OTHER COUNTY I MIGHT DO

00:54:57.727 --> 00:54:59.195
BUSINESS WITH.

00:54:59.262 --> 00:55:00.697
EACH COUNTY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO GO

00:55:00.764 --> 00:55:02.132
THROUGH THAT PROCESS ALL OVER

00:55:02.198 --> 00:55:04.367
AGAIN FOR THE SAME SET OF STAFF

00:55:04.434 --> 00:55:05.335
IT'S JUST.

00:55:05.402 --> 00:55:06.870
IT'S AN ENORMOUS BURDEN AND SO

00:55:06.936 --> 00:55:08.405
THE BURDEN ON THE COUNTY ON THE

00:55:08.471 --> 00:55:11.541
PROVIDERS AND THE WORK FORCE --

00:55:11.608 --> 00:55:13.710
THAT WE THINK WE CAN DO THINGS

00:55:13.777 --> 00:55:16.546
SMARTER ABOUT --

00:55:16.613 --> 00:55:18.515
A IT JUST ONE EXAMPLE TRAINING

00:55:18.581 --> 00:55:20.116
REQUIREMENTS THERE IS MANDATORY

00:55:20.183 --> 00:55:21.818
TRAINING REQUIREMENTS IF MY

00:55:21.885 --> 00:55:23.520
STAFF GET THAT MANDATORY

00:55:23.586 --> 00:55:25.822
TRAINING AND COUNTY HEY. FOR A

00:55:25.889 --> 00:55:27.490
SAM ASSESSMENTS OR WHATEVER IT

00:55:27.557 --> 00:55:28.792
HAPPENS TO BE.

00:55:28.858 --> 00:55:30.393
THAT SHOULD BE.

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:31.728
ABLE TO BE CARRIED OVER TO THE

00:55:31.795 --> 00:55:33.697
NEXT COUNTY.

00:55:33.763 --> 00:55:36.466
GROUP SIZE THE GROUP SIZE IN THE

00:55:36.533 --> 00:55:39.402
TERMS AND CONDITIONS --

00:55:39.469 --> 00:55:43.940
IN MY READ IS SPELLED OUT AT TWO

00:55:44.007 --> 00:55:47.210
TO FOURTEEN FOR CLINICAL GROUP --

00:55:47.277 --> 00:55:49.345
BUT IN PRACTICE IT BECAUSE I

00:55:49.412 --> 00:55:53.783
THINK IT'S AN STATE RAGS IT'S

00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:55.018
TWO TO TWELVE BUT WE'D LIKE TO

00:55:55.085 --> 00:55:56.286
SEE THAT TO TO FOURTEEN THAT'S

00:55:56.352 --> 00:55:58.822
IN TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND

00:55:58.888 --> 00:55:59.055
BRACED.

00:55:59.122 --> 00:56:00.590
IMMEDIATELY --

00:56:00.657 --> 00:56:02.092
I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT WAS AMENDED

00:56:02.158 --> 00:56:03.493
BUT I CAN FIND NO AMENDED

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:04.861
VERSION --

00:56:04.928 --> 00:56:06.963
THAT IT WAS AMENDED TO TO TO

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:07.464
TWELVE IN THE TERMS AND

00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:08.965
CONDITIONS WE IN FACT WOULD

00:56:09.032 --> 00:56:10.600
RECOMMEND IN THE RENEWAL THAT

00:56:10.667 --> 00:56:13.303
THAT GET MOVED.

00:56:13.369 --> 00:56:14.137
TO TO TO SIXTEEN HERE AGAIN FROM

00:56:14.204 --> 00:56:15.772
AN ACCESS STANDPOINT THE MORE

00:56:15.839 --> 00:56:17.507
LIMITED WE ARE ON THE SIZE OF

00:56:17.574 --> 00:56:18.808
THAT GROUP.

00:56:18.875 --> 00:56:20.777
THE MORE WE LIMIT ACCESS AND I

00:56:20.844 --> 00:56:22.345
DON'T THINK IN MOST OF THE FOLKS

00:56:22.412 --> 00:56:24.114
I SPEAK WITH DON'T THINK WE LOSE

00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:25.915
ANYTHING AND THE QUALITY OF

00:56:25.982 --> 00:56:26.916
THOSE GROUPS.

00:56:26.983 --> 00:56:28.418
BECAUSE IT GOES UP BY A COUPLE

00:56:28.485 --> 00:56:31.254
FOLKS IN FACT MANY OF THEM TO BE

00:56:31.321 --> 00:56:32.756
YOU YOU CAN'T GO OVER WHEN YOU

00:56:32.822 --> 00:56:36.059
BOOK IT. TO TWELVE AND HALF THE

00:56:36.126 --> 00:56:40.063
TIME YOU'RE RUNNING GROUPS WITH

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:40.663
TWO TO TEN BECAUSE OF NO SHOWS

00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:41.765
AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

00:56:41.831 --> 00:56:44.367
WE THINK THERE'S ROOM THERE --

00:56:44.434 --> 00:56:48.338
THE OF THE JUST KEEP GOING HERE

00:56:48.404 --> 00:56:52.075
OF WITHDRAWAL MANAGEMENT.

00:56:52.142 --> 00:56:53.810
THERE WAS A LOT OF EXPANSION

00:56:53.877 --> 00:56:55.912
WITHDRAWAL MANAGEMENT ONE OF THE

00:56:55.979 --> 00:56:57.514
PLACES THERE'S BEEN VERY LITTLE.

00:56:57.580 --> 00:56:58.882
THE EXPANSION BUT A TREMENDOUS

00:56:58.948 --> 00:56:59.816
MADE.

00:56:59.883 --> 00:57:01.951
ISN'T THREE POINT SEVEN AND FOUR

00:57:02.018 --> 00:57:02.952
POINT ALL.

00:57:03.019 --> 00:57:04.888
HIGHER ACUITY WITHDRAWAL

00:57:04.954 --> 00:57:07.524
MANAGEMENT POPULATION --

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:09.359
IT'S HOSPITAL BASED --

00:57:09.425 --> 00:57:12.328
WITHDRAWAL MANAGEMENT --

00:57:12.395 --> 00:57:15.298
THERE IS NEXT TO NO CAPACITY.

00:57:15.365 --> 00:57:16.766
ALL THE COUNTIES RECOGNIZE THAT

00:57:16.833 --> 00:57:18.134
SO WE THINK WE NEED TO FOCUS

00:57:18.201 --> 00:57:20.570
MORE ON THE BUT WE THINK THAT WE

00:57:20.637 --> 00:57:22.605
NEED TO LEVERAGE THE E. P. STT

00:57:22.672 --> 00:57:24.874
BENEFIT MUCH BETTER THAN WE DO

00:57:24.941 --> 00:57:26.609
TODAY IS PART OF ALL.

00:57:26.676 --> 00:57:28.545
OF INTEGRATING THAT WITH THE

00:57:28.611 --> 00:57:30.647
ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM IT'S

00:57:30.713 --> 00:57:32.816
PARTICULARLY CRUCIAL --

00:57:32.882 --> 00:57:34.317
FOR YOU SERVICES.

00:57:34.384 --> 00:57:35.985
THERE ARE SERVICES IN THE TERMS

00:57:36.052 --> 00:57:37.520
AND CONDITIONS AS PAT OF THE

00:57:37.587 --> 00:57:39.055
CONTINUING THAT HAVE BEEN

00:57:39.122 --> 00:57:40.290
SPELLED OUT.

00:57:40.356 --> 00:57:42.692
THAT ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED ACROSS

00:57:42.759 --> 00:57:45.128
THE BOARD COUNTY BY COUNTY.

00:57:45.195 --> 00:57:47.063
AN EXAMPLE OF THAT IN MY NOTES

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:50.200
THAT YOU'LL GET IS TELEHEALTH --

00:57:50.266 --> 00:57:51.501
IT IS NOT.

00:57:51.568 --> 00:57:54.070
BEEN BRACED BY EVERY COUNTY --

00:57:54.137 --> 00:57:56.072
TELEHEALTH WAS PUT IN THERE

00:57:56.139 --> 00:57:57.507
AGAIN.

00:57:57.574 --> 00:58:01.211
TO BOB HELP WITH ACCESS. TO CARE

00:58:01.277 --> 00:58:02.545
AND IF IT'S NOT.

00:58:02.612 --> 00:58:04.447
UTILIZE WE CAN'T MAKE THAT

00:58:04.514 --> 00:58:06.549
HEADLINE. ONE OF THE GREATEST

00:58:06.616 --> 00:58:10.687
BURDENS FOR PROVIDERS EHR SYSTEM.

00:58:10.753 --> 00:58:12.555
IF YOU DO BUSINESS WITH --

00:58:12.622 --> 00:58:14.624
ONE COUNTY IT'S ONE THING IF YOU

00:58:14.691 --> 00:58:15.892
DO BUSINESS WITH MULTIPLE

00:58:15.959 --> 00:58:17.460
COUNTIES AND UNDER THE ORGANIZED

00:58:17.527 --> 00:58:19.829
DELIVERY SYSTEM AND BECAUSE OF

00:58:19.896 --> 00:58:23.433
COUNTY OF RESIDENCE FOR SERVICE.

00:58:23.499 --> 00:58:25.635
THERE'S AN ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT

00:58:25.702 --> 00:58:27.003
TO DO BUSINESS WITH MORE THAN

00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:28.404
ONE COUNTY.

00:58:28.471 --> 00:58:30.874
EACH COUNTY HAS AN EXPECTATION

00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:33.276
THAT YOU EMBRACE THEIR EHR

00:58:33.343 --> 00:58:34.377
SYSTEM.

00:58:34.444 --> 00:58:35.778
REGARDLESS OF YOUR OWN EHR

00:58:35.845 --> 00:58:37.480
SYSTEM.

00:58:37.547 --> 00:58:40.783
AND MUCH OF THE TIME TAKE NO

00:58:40.850 --> 00:58:43.853
STEPS TO DEVELOPING THE PROPER

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:46.389
INTERFACES BETWEEN ONE H. R.

00:58:46.456 --> 00:58:48.024
SYSTEM ANDTHE OTHER SO DATA CAN

00:58:48.091 --> 00:58:50.827
BE PROPERLY EXCHANGED.

00:58:50.894 --> 00:58:53.663
AND THE COST AND THE DOUBLE

00:58:53.730 --> 00:58:56.132
TRIPLE DATA ENTRY ASSOCIATED

00:58:56.199 --> 00:58:57.500
WITH THAT AGAIN.

00:58:57.567 --> 00:58:59.302
SOMETHING WE CAN DO SOMETHING

00:58:59.369 --> 00:59:02.038
ABOUT WE JUST NEED TO FOCUS ON

00:59:02.105 --> 00:59:02.839
DOING IT.

00:59:02.906 --> 00:59:05.708
IT REALLY DETRACTS FROM THE

00:59:05.775 --> 00:59:07.844
PRIMARY PURPOSES --

00:59:07.911 --> 00:59:09.512
THAT POINT ON A RESIDENTIAL CARE

00:59:09.579 --> 00:59:11.814
IS ALSO IN MY NOTES WE NEED TO

00:59:11.881 --> 00:59:12.949
GET AWAY FROM THIS.

00:59:13.016 --> 00:59:14.450
OF CURRENT STRUCTURE ON

00:59:14.517 --> 00:59:16.920
RESIDENTIAL AND PROVIDE THAT

00:59:16.986 --> 00:59:17.820
BENEFIT.

00:59:17.887 --> 00:59:20.957
THE FULL OF SPAN OF DAYS TIED

00:59:21.024 --> 00:59:22.825
FOR MEDICAL NECESSITY AND NOT

00:59:22.892 --> 00:59:26.095
THIS TO BUY THE APPLE APPROACH

00:59:26.162 --> 00:59:27.497
THAT WE HAVE TODAY AND THERE --

00:59:27.563 --> 00:59:29.432
IT'S CONSTRAINING SO I MENTIONED

00:59:29.499 --> 00:59:31.734
THE COUNTY OF RESIDENCE AND

00:59:31.801 --> 00:59:33.636
COUNTY OF SERVICE ISSUE.

00:59:33.703 --> 00:59:36.439

00:59:36.506 --> 00:59:38.508
HUGE ADVOCATE HELPING.

00:59:38.574 --> 00:59:40.643

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:44.147
COUNTIES ARE STILL TREMENDOUS

00:59:44.213 --> 00:59:45.281
PROBLEMS WITH IT.

00:59:45.348 --> 00:59:47.517
EVEN IF YOU GET MULTIPLE COUNTY

00:59:47.583 --> 00:59:50.119
CONTRACTS YOU'VE GOT SOMEBODY IN

00:59:50.186 --> 00:59:51.721
A RESIDENTIAL BED FROM.

00:59:51.788 --> 00:59:53.623
OF COUNTY A IN YOUR SERVANT

00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:54.724
COUNTY BE.

00:59:54.791 --> 00:59:57.126
IF THEY NEED GENERAL HEALTH CARE.

00:59:57.193 --> 00:59:59.162
YOU CAN'T PROVIDE IN THAT COUNTY

00:59:59.228 --> 01:00:00.396
YOU'VE GOT TO GO BACK TO THE

01:00:00.463 --> 01:00:01.898
COUNTY OF ORIGIN.

01:00:01.965 --> 01:00:03.599
IF THEY NEED A PRESCRIPTION YOU

01:00:03.666 --> 01:00:05.234

01:00:05.301 --> 01:00:07.036
ORIGIN -- WE

01:00:07.103 --> 01:00:09.772

01:00:17.146 --> 01:00:18.181

01:00:18.247 --> 01:00:20.216
WE ALL HOPE AND PRAY THAT THE

01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:21.951

01:04:39.675 --> 01:04:40.509
IT'S REQUIRED.

01:04:40.576 --> 01:04:43.746
CAN YOU TALK FURTHER ON THAT

01:04:43.813 --> 01:04:48.384
SHOW TO DO THIS WITH A STAFF

01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:50.219
THAT THEY NEED --

01:04:50.286 --> 01:04:52.822
TO VERIFY EDUCATION LICENSURE

01:04:52.888 --> 01:04:54.757
BACKGROUND --

01:04:54.824 --> 01:04:56.459
SO IT'S THAT KIND OF INFORMATION

01:04:56.525 --> 01:04:58.527
YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH REPEATED

01:04:58.594 --> 01:04:59.795
TIMES THAT.

01:04:59.862 --> 01:05:01.330
WE THINK IT'S PRETTY

01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:03.065
STANDARDIZED IN THAT.

01:05:03.132 --> 01:05:04.500
IF IT'S DONE IN ONE PLACE.

01:05:04.567 --> 01:05:06.836
AND APPROVED IT SHOULD BE USABLE

01:05:06.902 --> 01:05:08.738
ELSEWHERE.

01:05:08.804 --> 01:05:10.740
SO TO THAT QUESTION IS THERE ARE

01:05:10.806 --> 01:05:12.541
YOU DO NOT HAVE A CENTRALIZED

01:05:12.608 --> 01:05:15.611
SYSTEM THAT TRACKS EVERYONE.

01:05:15.678 --> 01:05:17.146
BY WAY OF EXAMPLE MY TEACHER SO

01:05:17.213 --> 01:05:18.748
IF I GO FROM SCHOOL TO SCHOOL

01:05:18.814 --> 01:05:20.249

AT A CREDENTIALED TEACHER DO YOU

01:05:23.486 --> 01:05:25.221
GUYS HAVE A CENTRALIZED THERE IS

01:05:25.288 --> 01:05:26.889
THERE ARE NO SUCH CENTRALIZED

01:05:26.956 --> 01:05:28.991
SYSTEM IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR THAT

UNDER THE O. D. S..

01:05:31.761 --> 01:05:34.130
THERE IS SUCH A CENTRALIZED

01:05:34.196 --> 01:05:36.132
SYSTEM IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR --

01:05:36.198 --> 01:05:38.434
BUT EVEN IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR

01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:43.406
NOT ALL HEALTH PLANS UTILIZED.

01:05:43.472 --> 01:05:44.707
SOME DO SOME DON'T.

01:05:44.774 --> 01:05:46.108
THANK YOU FOR THAT AND LAST

FOR WE KNOW THAT NOT ALL 7% ARE

01:07:33.082 --> 01:07:34.150

URBAN INSTITUTE I'M OUT OF

01:07:43.025 --> 01:07:43.592
TWENTY SIXTEEN THE ALL PROVIDERS

01:07:43.659 --> 01:07:44.460
HAVE NOT BEEN USING THEIR

01:07:44.527 --> 01:07:46.462
WAIVERS TO MAXIMUM CAPACITY OR

01:07:46.529 --> 01:07:47.430
SOME OF THEM ARE.

01:07:47.496 --> 01:07:49.365
CLOSETED PROVIDERS WHERE THEY'RE

01:07:49.432 --> 01:07:50.065
NOT UTILIZING THE WAIVERS AT ALL.

01:07:50.132 --> 01:07:51.734
IS SO WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THE

01:07:51.801 --> 01:07:52.935
IMPEDIMENT IS THAT WHAT WE HEARD

01:07:53.002 --> 01:07:55.638
FROM OUR OUR RESEARCHER BEFORE.

01:07:55.704 --> 01:07:57.873
THAT THEY'RE NOT CONFIDENT OR

01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:58.908
OTHER DATA FEELING HAVE THE

01:07:58.974 --> 01:08:00.576

WHAT DO YOU SEEN AND AND I'VE

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:04.914
ASKED SOME OF THESE PROVIDERS

MYSELF AND I'M GETTING A A FEW

01:08:07.716 --> 01:08:08.551
THEMES.

01:08:08.617 --> 01:08:11.120
ARE SOME OF THE THEMES THAT I'VE

01:08:11.187 --> 01:08:13.322
HEARD ARE YOU KNOW BEING I'M

01:08:13.389 --> 01:08:14.924
HAVING THE FLOODGATES OPEN AND

01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:16.058
NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH THIS

01:08:16.125 --> 01:08:17.860
BEING A NEW SPECIALTY --

01:08:17.927 --> 01:08:19.128
JUST THAT GENERAL FEAR OF

01:08:19.195 --> 01:08:20.496
STARTING MEDICATION ASSISTED

01:08:20.563 --> 01:08:22.364
TREATMENT SOME PROVIDERS HAVE

01:08:22.431 --> 01:08:23.866
THE LICENSE BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:26.469
THEIR PRIMARY SPECIALTY IS AND

01:08:26.535 --> 01:08:27.236
SO JUMPING ON BOARD HAS BEEN

01:08:27.303 --> 01:08:28.737
REALLY HARD HOW WE'VE BEEN

01:08:28.804 --> 01:08:29.839
TACKLING THAT.

01:08:29.905 --> 01:08:30.639
IS THROUGH OUR EXPERT

01:08:30.706 --> 01:08:32.074
FACILITATORS AND HUMBLE WE'RE

01:08:32.141 --> 01:08:32.808

TO THE NEW PROVIDERS IN THOSE

01:08:36.378 --> 01:08:37.446
ORGANIZATIONS AND WALK THEM

01:08:37.513 --> 01:08:38.481
THROUGH IT SHE'S BEEN DOING

01:08:38.547 --> 01:08:40.149
MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT

01:08:40.216 --> 01:08:40.883
FOR TEN YEARS AND IT'S VERY

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:42.251
COMFORTABLE.

01:08:42.318 --> 01:08:43.486
THROUGH HER HELP AND SUPPORT

01:08:43.552 --> 01:08:44.787
SPEAKING FROM ONE PROVIDER TO

01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:45.754
ANOTHER PROVIDER WITHIN THEIR

01:08:45.821 --> 01:08:47.189
LANGUAGE WE'VE BEEN GAVE GETTING

01:08:47.256 --> 01:08:49.992
SOME MORE AND MORE ON BOARD --

01:08:50.059 --> 01:08:51.594
BUT IT IS A PROCESS.

01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:52.328
SO YOU ALSO MENTIONED YOU HAVE

01:08:52.394 --> 01:08:54.029
BUT EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT

01:08:54.096 --> 01:08:56.499
COULD UTILIZE HERS BUT I CAN'T

01:08:56.565 --> 01:08:57.833
BECAUSE THERE'S NO ACCESS SO.

01:08:57.900 --> 01:08:59.368
SO -- IS

01:08:59.435 --> 01:09:01.237
THAT ARE YOU SEEING THAT IN

01:09:01.303 --> 01:09:03.672
OTHER COUNTIES AS WELL OR IS

01:09:03.739 --> 01:09:05.040
THIS OR IS THIS A HIGHER.

01:09:05.107 --> 01:09:07.643
PERCENTAGE IN HUMBLE COUNTY THAN

01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:08.711
THROUGHOUT SOME OF THE OTHER

01:09:08.777 --> 01:09:09.945
COUNTY SITUATION WHERE I AM

01:09:10.012 --> 01:09:11.247
SEEING THAT THROUGHOUT ALL SIX

01:09:11.313 --> 01:09:12.548
OF OUR GRANT REGIONS --

01:09:12.615 --> 01:09:14.116
HUMBLE IS A HIGH PERCENTAGE

01:09:14.183 --> 01:09:15.784
GIVEN HOW ROLE SO MANY OF THE

01:09:15.851 --> 01:09:17.219
AREAS ARE AND SOME OF THOSE

01:09:17.286 --> 01:09:19.221
BARRIERS WITH TRANSPORTATION AND

01:09:19.288 --> 01:09:20.189
ASSISTANCE.

01:09:20.256 --> 01:09:22.024
YOU ARE ALSO AND I NOTED THAT --

01:09:22.091 --> 01:09:23.926
ON ONE OF THE EARLIER SLIDES IN

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:25.594
THE FIRST OUR FIRST PRESENTATION

01:09:25.661 --> 01:09:27.763
THERE WAS NO SPOKE TO DOWN OR

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:29.164
COUNTY.

01:09:29.231 --> 01:09:30.499
BUT THERE IS WITH YOU SOMEONE IN

01:09:30.566 --> 01:09:31.667
THE MUST BE A LAG IN THE DATA OR

01:09:31.734 --> 01:09:33.969
SOMETHING BECAUSE THAT WAS

01:09:34.036 --> 01:09:36.338
JANUARY NINETEEN REPORT AND YOU

01:09:36.405 --> 01:09:37.773
HAVE A SPOKE BUT IT WHAT DIDN'T

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.308
SHOW UP IN THE OTHER DATA S

01:09:39.375 --> 01:09:40.242
HUMBOLDT ACTUALLY ARE ONLY

01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:41.710
TERRITORY WHERE WE DON'T.

01:09:41.777 --> 01:09:43.112
HAVE A PHYSICAL HUB AT THIS

01:09:43.178 --> 01:09:43.979
MOMENT --

01:09:44.046 --> 01:09:45.548
ALL OF OUR OTHER GRANTS HAVE A

01:09:45.614 --> 01:09:47.750
PHYSICAL HUB WE ARE OPENING UP A

01:09:47.816 --> 01:09:49.552
CLINIC IN YOUR RICA EITHER LATER

01:09:49.618 --> 01:09:50.986
THIS YEAR OR EARLY NEXT YEAR

01:09:51.053 --> 01:09:52.688
WHICH WILL OPERATE AS THE HUB TO

01:09:52.755 --> 01:09:53.289
HUMBLE.

01:09:53.355 --> 01:09:54.256
BUT AT THIS POINT WE'VE

01:09:54.323 --> 01:09:56.659
CONNECTED ALL OF OUR SPOKES TO

01:09:56.725 --> 01:09:58.193
EXPERT FACILITATORS AND WE'RE

01:09:58.260 --> 01:09:59.929
CREATING A MEDICAL NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:09:59.995 --> 01:10:01.263
EVEN THOUGH WE DO NOT HAVE A

01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:03.699
PHYSICAL HALBERSTAM.

01:10:03.766 --> 01:10:05.501
SO WHAT IS THE IMPEDIMENT TO A

01:10:05.568 --> 01:10:07.703
HUB IN HUMBLE COUNTY.

01:10:07.770 --> 01:10:10.606
I'M AT THIS POINT WE THE HOPE IS

01:10:10.673 --> 01:10:12.508
TO OPEN -- I

01:10:12.575 --> 01:10:13.042
HAVE BEEN HUMBOLDT COUNTY

01:10:13.108 --> 01:10:13.776
QUESTION.

01:10:13.842 --> 01:10:15.911
BUT SO I'M CURIOUS WHERE WHERE

01:10:15.978 --> 01:10:17.546
IS THE REASON AND I AYE AND

01:10:17.613 --> 01:10:18.347
PHYSICAL I UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:10:18.414 --> 01:10:19.048
YOU'RE DOING.

01:10:19.114 --> 01:10:21.450
BUT WHAT WHAT MAKES IT SO

01:10:21.517 --> 01:10:23.285
CHALLENGING TO CREATE A HUB IN

01:10:23.352 --> 01:10:25.254
HUMBOLDT COUNTY.

01:10:25.321 --> 01:10:26.822
WHAT ARE THE FACTORS OUT THERE --

01:10:26.889 --> 01:10:28.223
LEADING TO ABOUT I THINK THE

01:10:28.290 --> 01:10:29.325
CHALLENGE --

01:10:29.391 --> 01:10:30.960
LIES WITHIN THE SAME CHARGES

01:10:31.026 --> 01:10:31.961
THAT I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO WITH

01:10:32.027 --> 01:10:32.895
THE STIGMA --

01:10:32.962 --> 01:10:35.064

WHO ARE ENGAGING IN AND

01:19:17.252 --> 01:19:18.587
TREATMENT THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL.

01:19:18.653 --> 01:19:19.721
THE MORE MORE WE TALK ABOUT IT

01:19:19.788 --> 01:19:21.022
THE MORE AND MORE WE SEE

01:19:21.089 --> 01:19:22.324
PROVIDERS COMING ON BOARD THAT

01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:23.825
WEREN'T THERE A YEAR AGO OR TWO

01:19:23.892 --> 01:19:25.627
YEARS AGO AND SO THE

01:19:25.694 --> 01:19:27.729
CONVERSATION IS NECESSARY. FOR

01:19:27.796 --> 01:19:31.566

WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME ABOUT

01:19:45.714 --> 01:19:47.315
HEARING THIS IS BETTER THAN WHAT

01:19:47.382 --> 01:19:49.718
WE WERE DOING BEFORE SO WITH SO --

01:19:49.784 --> 01:19:50.619
BUT WE ALSO HEARD THAT WE'RE

01:19:50.685 --> 01:19:52.454
ONLY REACHING A FRY A FRACTION

01:19:52.521 --> 01:19:53.522
OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT THERE

01:19:53.588 --> 01:19:55.157
I REALIZE IS A CHALLENGING

01:19:55.223 --> 01:19:56.625
POPULATION --

01:19:56.691 --> 01:19:59.294

INCREASE TREATMENT BY 80% NUMBER

01:20:03.198 --> 01:20:05.767
OF PEOPLE SO ACTUALLY US OF THAT

01:20:05.834 --> 01:20:07.802
SO I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE AT THE

01:20:07.869 --> 01:20:08.670
AVERAGE 7%?

01:20:08.737 --> 01:20:10.138
BECAUSE YOU'RE AT 80% I REALLY

01:20:10.205 --> 01:20:11.840
OUT THE WAY EVERYONE ELSE WAS AT

01:20:11.907 --> 01:20:13.508
SO -- SUIT

01:20:13.575 --> 01:20:14.009
CLEARLY VERY SUCCESSFUL

01:20:14.075 --> 01:20:17.279
RIVERSIDE.

01:20:17.345 --> 01:20:20.982
COUNTY BUT WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP --

01:20:21.049 --> 01:20:21.983

01:20:25.353 --> 01:20:25.987
IS YOU CAN TELL ME WHEN

01:20:26.054 --> 01:20:26.988
RIVERSIDE YOU GOT IT ALL TAKEN

01:20:27.055 --> 01:20:28.757
CARE OF OR JUST A LONG WAY TO GO.

01:20:28.823 --> 01:20:29.925
AND WHAT TO WHICH WE BE DOING TO

01:20:29.991 --> 01:20:30.926

01:20:35.197 --> 01:20:35.597
YOUR PEOPLE.

01:20:35.664 --> 01:20:39.601
THERE IS STILL A LOT MORE TO DO --

01:20:39.668 --> 01:20:41.069
TREATMENT IS WE WERE FINALLY

01:20:41.136 --> 01:20:43.471
PAYING THE RESIDENTIAL PROVIDERS

01:20:43.538 --> 01:20:45.540
WHAT THEY WERE WORSE.

01:20:45.607 --> 01:20:48.143
PREVIOUSLY WE WERE ONLY.

01:20:48.210 --> 01:20:49.744
ABLE TO PAY THEM SOMETHING LIKE

01:20:49.811 --> 01:20:51.179
EIGHTY DOLLARS A DAY.

01:20:51.246 --> 01:20:52.614
AND THE PROVIDERS WEREN'T

01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:55.250
WILLING TO GIVE THE COUNTY OF

01:20:55.317 --> 01:20:57.752
MORE THAN JUST A FEW BADS NOW

01:20:57.819 --> 01:20:59.721
WE'RE ACTUALLY ABLE.

01:20:59.788 --> 01:21:01.489
TO PAY THEM A REASONABLE --

01:21:01.556 --> 01:21:03.525
DAILY RATE AND SO TO THE

01:21:03.592 --> 01:21:05.293
PROVIDERS WERE DâN MORE THAN

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:09.497
WILLING TO OPEN MORE BEDS FOR

01:21:09.564 --> 01:21:10.398
THE COUNTY TO USE AND SO THAT.

01:21:10.465 --> 01:21:11.600
MUCH ATTRIBUTED FOR THAT

01:21:11.666 --> 01:21:13.835
SIGNIFICANT GROWTH THERE --

01:21:13.902 --> 01:21:17.072
I THINK AS LONG AS WE ARE ABLE.

01:21:17.138 --> 01:21:19.608
TO CONTINUE TO PAY OUR PROVIDERS --

01:21:19.674 --> 01:21:21.610
WHAT THEY'RE WORTH AND --

01:21:21.676 --> 01:21:23.545
IF WE CAN EXPAND THE NETWORK OF

01:21:23.612 --> 01:21:25.113
PROVIDERS THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:26.581
REALLY CRITICAL --

01:21:26.648 --> 01:21:29.818
MANY OF THE PRIVATE PROVIDERS

01:21:29.884 --> 01:21:32.954
DON'T WANNA PLAY WITH THE THEY

01:21:33.021 --> 01:21:35.390
CAN GET MORE FROM --

01:21:35.457 --> 01:21:37.225
SOME OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES

01:21:37.292 --> 01:21:39.027
THAT THEY WORK WITH SO --

01:21:39.094 --> 01:21:40.528
I I THINK.

01:21:40.595 --> 01:21:41.596
THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS THAT WE

01:21:41.663 --> 01:21:43.198
CAN IMPACT US BUT WE'RE

01:21:43.265 --> 01:21:45.333
CERTAINLY NOWHERE NEAR --

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:47.068
TO THE POINT WHERE WE CAN REST

01:21:47.135 --> 01:21:50.138
ON OUR LAURELS YET.

01:21:50.205 --> 01:21:51.439
AND LESS THAN LA KNOW THAT --

01:21:51.506 --> 01:21:53.275
LOOKING FOR TO GET A COPY OF

01:21:53.341 --> 01:21:54.442
YOUR WRITTEN TESTIMONY YOU TOUCH

01:21:54.509 --> 01:21:57.846
ON MANY DIFFERENT TOPICS --

01:21:57.912 --> 01:21:58.747
GET THROUGH ALL OF THEM BY BY

01:21:58.813 --> 01:22:00.015
THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE A LOT

01:22:00.081 --> 01:22:01.716
OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT YOU

01:22:01.783 --> 01:22:02.284
MENTIONED THAT WE SHOULD BE

01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:03.852
LOOKING AT ONE OF THE THINGS I

01:22:03.918 --> 01:22:04.886
WAS INTERESTED THOSE YOU

01:22:04.953 --> 01:22:06.888

01:22:06.955 --> 01:22:09.124
CAPACITY AND NOW WE DO COST

01:22:09.190 --> 01:22:09.591
BASED.

01:22:09.658 --> 01:22:11.693
REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND YOU THAT

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:13.361
MAKE REMARKS THAT WELL OF COURSE

01:22:13.428 --> 01:22:14.996
THAT MEANS THAT IF WE DO COST

01:22:15.063 --> 01:22:16.298
BASE TO COVER THE COSTS BUT

01:22:16.364 --> 01:22:19.567
THERE'S NO CAPITAL FOR FURTHER.

01:22:19.634 --> 01:22:21.536
EXPANSION RIGHT --

01:22:21.603 --> 01:22:23.538
NOW I THINK IT MAY BE A

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:25.040
CHALLENGE TO SAY WHICH IS GOOD

01:22:25.106 --> 01:22:25.807
NOW I HAVE TO DEAL INCREASE

01:22:25.874 --> 01:22:27.542
RATES SO THAT YOU CAN ACCUMULATE

ARE THERE OTHER ALTERNATIVES FOR

01:22:30.345 --> 01:22:31.713
EXAMPLE IS LIKE A REVOLVING

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:33.948
CAPITAL FUND THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE

01:22:34.015 --> 01:22:36.418
TO BUILD SO THAT THEY CAN --

01:22:36.484 --> 01:22:37.652
EXPAND OUR OF A IT IS SOME

01:22:37.719 --> 01:22:38.687
THOUGHTS.

01:22:38.753 --> 01:22:40.555
BEYOND JUST INCREASING I MEAN WE

NIGHT WE JUST HEARD ABOUT THAT --

01:22:44.092 --> 01:22:46.328
BUT IT IN TERMS OF TRYING TO

01:22:46.394 --> 01:22:47.362
BUILD THAT CAPACITY WHERE THE

01:22:47.429 --> 01:22:50.932
BARRIERS TO BUILDING THAT

AS MANY COUNTIES AS POSSIBLE

01:32:28.442 --> 01:32:28.976
THOSE YOU'VE HEARD FROM OTHER

01:32:29.043 --> 01:32:29.877
FOLKS WHO HAVE.

THERE ARE CHALLENGES INVOLVED IN

01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:34.181
THAT THAT INVOLVED --

01:32:34.248 --> 01:32:35.950
AND INVESTMENT OF RESOURCES AND

01:32:36.017 --> 01:32:37.351
INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:32:37.418 --> 01:32:38.352
I THINK --

01:32:38.419 --> 01:32:39.921
FIRST OF ALL ALL FOCUS.

01:32:39.987 --> 01:32:41.355
WITHIN THAT REALM ON NETWORK

01:32:41.422 --> 01:32:42.790
ADEQUACY AND CERTAINLY WE SEE

01:32:42.857 --> 01:32:44.292
AMONG THE COUNTIES A GROWTH IN

01:32:44.358 --> 01:32:45.593
ALL LEVELS OF CARE WE'VE HEARD

01:32:45.660 --> 01:32:47.194
ABOUT PARTICULARLY WITHDRAWAL

01:32:47.261 --> 01:32:48.696
MANAGEMENT AND RESIDENTIAL

01:32:48.763 --> 01:32:50.064
TREATMENT BEDS AS A NEED.

01:32:50.131 --> 01:32:51.565
CERTAINLY AS AS BUILT --

01:32:51.632 --> 01:32:54.035
FACILITIES EITHER EXPANDING --

01:32:54.101 --> 01:32:55.202
RENOVATING OR BUILDING NEW

01:32:55.269 --> 01:32:57.171
FACILITIES REQUIRES INVESTMENT

01:32:57.238 --> 01:32:57.905
IN THAT SOMETHING WE WOULD

01:32:57.972 --> 01:32:59.573
ENCOURAGE PERHAPS THROUGH SOME

01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:00.708
SORT OF CAPITAL INVESTMENT AT

01:33:00.775 --> 01:33:01.776
THE STATE LEVEL.

01:33:01.842 --> 01:33:03.277
WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE

01:33:03.344 --> 01:33:05.313
DEPARTMENTS EFFORTS IN THE AREA

01:33:05.379 --> 01:33:06.314
OF STREAMLINING DRUG MEDICAL

01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:08.249

01:33:08.316 --> 01:33:09.650
NEW PROVIDERS IN TO OUR NETWORKS.

01:33:09.717 --> 01:33:11.619
WE ALSO --

01:33:11.686 --> 01:33:15.256
WE ALSO OF OF THE IN TERMS OF

01:33:15.323 --> 01:33:18.326
THE STIGMA USE TREATMENT TO MAKE

01:33:18.392 --> 01:33:22.830
AS THERAPEUTIC COMMUNITIES NOT --

01:33:22.897 --> 01:33:24.065
NOT FACILITIES THAT PROVOKE UP

01:33:24.131 --> 01:33:25.733
POSITION.

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:27.068
IN ADDITION YOU'VE HEARD QUITE A

01:33:27.134 --> 01:33:28.736
BIT ABOUT THE WORK FORCE.

01:33:28.803 --> 01:33:29.737
I THINK ONE OF THE TREMENDOUS

01:33:29.804 --> 01:33:30.838
STRENGTHENED LEGACIES OF

01:33:30.905 --> 01:33:31.605
SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT

01:33:31.672 --> 01:33:33.441
PROVIDERS IS THAT WE RELY ON A

01:33:33.507 --> 01:33:35.376
GREAT DEAL OF OF PEER EXPERIENCE

01:33:35.443 --> 01:33:36.744
LIVED EXPERIENCE.

01:33:36.811 --> 01:33:38.012
THAT IS IN MANY CASES AND

01:33:38.079 --> 01:33:39.513
COUNSELING AND GROUP SESSIONS

01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:40.948
VERY VALUABLE.

01:33:41.015 --> 01:33:41.983
AT THE SAME TIME I THINK WE

01:33:42.049 --> 01:33:43.351
STRUGGLE TO RECRUIT ENOUGH OF

01:33:43.417 --> 01:33:44.752
THOSE PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE

01:33:44.819 --> 01:33:46.587
CLINICIANS EITHER REGISTERED OR

01:33:46.654 --> 01:33:47.121
CERTIFIED --

01:33:47.188 --> 01:33:49.256
COUNSELORS BUT ALSO LICENSED

01:33:49.323 --> 01:33:51.025
PROFESSIONALS THAT WE ALSO NEED

01:33:51.092 --> 01:33:51.959
TO DO THE PRESCRIBING WE'VE

01:33:52.026 --> 01:33:53.527
SPOKEN ABOUT AND TO DETERMINE

01:33:53.594 --> 01:33:55.062
MEDICAL NECESSITY.

01:33:55.129 --> 01:33:56.297
EITHER IF THEY'RE LICENSED

01:33:56.364 --> 01:33:57.631
CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER OR A

01:33:57.698 --> 01:33:58.766
LICENSED MARRIAGE AND FAMILY

01:33:58.833 --> 01:34:00.167
THERAPIST --

01:34:00.234 --> 01:34:01.435
IN ADDITION TO THAT THE WORK

01:34:01.502 --> 01:34:02.737
FORCE OFTEN STRUGGLES WITH

01:34:02.803 --> 01:34:04.038
DOCUMENTATION WHICH IS JUST A

01:34:04.105 --> 01:34:06.140
REQUIREMENT OF NOT ONLY MEDI CAL

01:34:06.207 --> 01:34:07.541
BUT MODERN HEALTH CARE.

01:34:07.608 --> 01:34:09.643
AND WE SO WE STRUGGLE TO MAKE

01:34:09.710 --> 01:34:10.811
SURE THAT WE'RE TRAINING OUR OUR

01:34:10.878 --> 01:34:12.480
CLINICIANS TO TO MEET THOSE

01:34:12.546 --> 01:34:13.981
STANDARDS THAT ARE REQUIREMENT.

01:34:14.048 --> 01:34:15.449
OF F OUR SYSTEMS.

01:34:15.516 --> 01:34:16.851
IN ADDITION WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

01:34:16.917 --> 01:34:19.553
THAT WERE THAT WE NEED TO SERVE

01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:20.755
AND THE LANGUAGES THAT THEY

01:34:20.821 --> 01:34:22.189
SPEAK BUT ALSO WITH CULTURAL

01:34:22.256 --> 01:34:24.392
SPECIFICITY WE SPOKE ABOUT THAT

01:34:24.458 --> 01:34:25.793
SOME ALREADY TODAY --

01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:28.262
AND SO REFLECTING OR HAVING A A

01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:29.363
WORKFORCE THAT REFLECTS THAT

01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:30.398
NEEDED THAT SERVES THE

01:34:30.464 --> 01:34:31.766
COMMUNITIES AND UNDERSTANDS THE

01:34:31.832 --> 01:34:33.334
COMMUNITIES THAT WE MUST --

01:34:33.401 --> 01:34:34.935
WORK IN --

01:34:35.002 --> 01:34:36.370
IS VERY IMPORTANT AND AND

01:34:36.437 --> 01:34:37.004
SOMETHING WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO

01:34:37.071 --> 01:34:39.106
WORK ON YOU'VE HEARD QUITE A BIT

01:34:39.173 --> 01:34:40.474
ALSO ABOUT THE YOUTH SYSTEM OF

01:34:40.541 --> 01:34:41.575
CARE -- AND

01:34:41.642 --> 01:34:43.611
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT I THINK TO

01:34:43.677 --> 01:34:45.079
TOO MANY COUNTIES TO HIGHLIGHT

01:34:45.146 --> 01:34:46.380
THAT -- ALL

01:34:46.447 --> 01:34:48.015
OF THE ISSUES I MENTIONED SO FAR

01:34:48.082 --> 01:34:49.483
WHEN IT COMES TO INFRASTRUCTURE

01:34:49.550 --> 01:34:51.285
AND TO WORK FORCE THERE EVEN

01:34:51.352 --> 01:34:52.987
MORE EXTREME IN THE YOUTH --

01:34:53.054 --> 01:34:54.655
AND THE YOU SYSTEMS OF CARE TO

01:34:54.722 --> 01:34:56.290
RECRUIT PROFESSIONALS WHO HAVE

01:34:56.357 --> 01:34:57.858
THE THE ABILITY TO DELIVER

01:34:57.925 --> 01:34:58.959
DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE

01:34:59.026 --> 01:34:59.827
SERVICES.

01:34:59.894 --> 01:35:01.128
AND IN MOST SETTINGS THAT WOULD

01:35:01.195 --> 01:35:03.564
REQUIRE NOT ALWAYS BUT OFTEN A

01:35:03.631 --> 01:35:05.099
LICENSED PROFESSIONAL TO SERVE

01:35:05.166 --> 01:35:06.000
SOMEONE --

01:35:06.067 --> 01:35:07.501
WITH THE THE LEVEL OF EXPERTISE

01:35:07.568 --> 01:35:09.370
AND TRAINING TO TO SERVE AT RISK

01:35:09.437 --> 01:35:10.237
YOUTH.

01:35:10.304 --> 01:35:11.338
I THINK IN ADDITION YOU'VE HEARD

01:35:11.405 --> 01:35:12.640
ABOUT THE EARLY PERIODIC

01:35:12.706 --> 01:35:13.774
SCREENING DIAGNOSTIC AND

01:35:13.841 --> 01:35:15.309
TREATMENT BENEFIT THAT IS A

01:35:15.376 --> 01:35:16.811
MANDATE UNDER MEDICAID AND THE

01:35:16.877 --> 01:35:18.245
pMEDICARE PROGRAM.

01:35:18.312 --> 01:35:20.014
WE IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTATE HOW

01:35:20.081 --> 01:35:21.215
IMPORTANT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

01:35:21.282 --> 01:35:23.417
ODS IS TO REALIZING THAT.

01:35:23.484 --> 01:35:24.685
THEY'RE ALL THE TOOLS IN OUR

01:35:24.752 --> 01:35:27.955
TOOLBOX THIS WAIVER PILOT TO

01:35:28.022 --> 01:35:29.256
MAKE THAT REAL AND AVAILABLE

01:35:29.323 --> 01:35:30.624
ACROSS THE STATE.

01:35:30.691 --> 01:35:31.592
AND WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING WE

01:35:31.659 --> 01:35:32.993
CAN I THINK TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:34.762
ALL COUNTIES HAVE WHAT THEY NEED

01:35:34.829 --> 01:35:35.763
TO TO MAKE SURE THAT.

01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:37.298
YOU GET THE THE BENEFITS THAT

01:35:37.364 --> 01:35:38.466
THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR AN

01:35:38.532 --> 01:35:40.101
ENTITLED TO ONE OF THE PROGRAM.

01:35:40.167 --> 01:35:42.069
AND ALSO WITH AS I SAID THE THE

01:35:42.136 --> 01:35:44.071
DEVELOPMENTAL SPECIFICITY OF THE

01:35:44.138 --> 01:35:46.340
DATE THAT THEY NEED --

01:35:46.407 --> 01:35:48.509
I THINK IN ADDITION. ONE OF THE

01:35:48.576 --> 01:35:49.610
OTHER AREAS THAT WE AS AN

01:35:49.677 --> 01:35:50.811
ASSOCIATION ARE FOCUSED ON IS

01:35:50.878 --> 01:35:52.513
THE WAY FOR RENEWAL IN TWENTY

01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:53.481
TWENTY THERE ARE MULTIPLE

RENEWAL --

01:35:55.716 --> 01:35:57.151
NEXT YEAR AND I THINK THERE ARE

01:35:57.218 --> 01:35:58.652
THREE BROAD GOALS THAT WE WOULD

01:35:58.719 --> 01:35:59.987
EMPHASIZE IN THAT AND ARE

01:36:00.054 --> 01:36:01.255
ANXIOUS TO WORK WITH THE

01:36:01.322 --> 01:36:02.723
DEPARTMENT ON DEVELOPING --

01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:04.125
THE THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF

01:36:04.191 --> 01:36:06.060
OF A RENEWAL WAIVER I THINK ONE

01:36:06.127 --> 01:36:07.194
IS TO INTEGRATE BEHAVIORAL

01:36:07.261 --> 01:36:08.429
HEALTH SERVICES BOTH MENTAL

01:36:08.496 --> 01:36:10.264
HEALTH PLAN SERVICES AND

01:36:10.331 --> 01:36:11.966
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES.

01:36:12.032 --> 01:36:13.234
AND ALSO TO INTEGRATE THOSE

01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:15.269
SERVICES WITH THE BROADER MEDI

01:36:15.336 --> 01:36:16.570
CAL AND HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS.

01:36:16.637 --> 01:36:17.505
SO -- WE

01:36:17.571 --> 01:36:18.405
WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SPEAK VERY

01:36:18.472 --> 01:36:20.474
EXPLICITLY TO THOSE GOALS AND

01:36:20.541 --> 01:36:21.609
THE RENEWAL OF THE WAIVER I

01:36:21.675 --> 01:36:22.943
THINK THE THIRD THING THAT ALSO

01:36:23.010 --> 01:36:24.812
IS VERY IMPORTANT AND A PRIORITY

01:36:24.879 --> 01:36:26.247
OF THE ASSOCIATION AND OF OF

01:36:26.313 --> 01:36:27.681
COUNTIES.

01:36:27.748 --> 01:36:28.549
IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S

01:36:28.616 --> 01:36:30.684
FLEXIBILITY TO HAVE A FRAMEWORK

01:36:30.751 --> 01:36:32.052
THAT WORKS NOT ONLY IN LOS

01:36:32.119 --> 01:36:33.888
ANGELES OR SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUT

01:36:33.954 --> 01:36:34.688
ALSO HUMBLED.

01:36:34.755 --> 01:36:36.757
MONO SIERRA LAKE OTHER COUNTIES

01:36:36.824 --> 01:36:38.459
THAT ARE ARE RURAL AND HAVE VERY

01:36:38.526 --> 01:36:39.927
DIFFERENT --

01:36:39.994 --> 01:36:40.528
NEEDS AND PROFILES OF PEOPLE

01:36:40.594 --> 01:36:42.596
THAT THEY HAVE --

01:36:42.663 --> 01:36:44.431
THAT'S I THINK AN IMPORTANT

01:36:44.498 --> 01:36:45.099
FEATURE THAT WOULD ALSO LIKE TO

01:36:45.166 --> 01:36:45.733
HIGHLIGHT.

01:36:45.799 --> 01:36:46.734
I'LL ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE

01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:48.068
EARLIER ABOUT THE TO NINETY DAY

01:36:48.135 --> 01:36:49.770
STAYS I THINK WE WOULD WE WOULD

01:36:49.837 --> 01:36:51.705
ADVOCATE EITHER FOR A CAP ON THE

01:36:51.772 --> 01:36:53.140
NUMBER OF DAYS IN A YEAR THAT

01:36:53.207 --> 01:36:54.708
YOU CAN STAY IN RESIDENTIAL.

01:36:54.775 --> 01:36:56.076
THE ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE TO

01:36:56.143 --> 01:36:57.011
SHORTEN PERHAPS THE

01:36:57.077 --> 01:36:58.913
AUTHORIZATION PERIODS WITHOUT A

01:36:58.979 --> 01:37:00.915
CAP A STRICT CAPS IN A SHORTER

01:37:00.981 --> 01:37:02.683
AUTHORIZATION PERIOD WOULD

01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:03.918
ENSURE THAT THERE'S ONGOING

01:37:03.984 --> 01:37:04.985
MEDICAL NECESSITY FOR THAT

01:37:05.052 --> 01:37:06.554
HIGHER MORE EXPENSIVE LEVEL OF

01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:07.087
CARE.

01:37:07.154 --> 01:37:08.989
WITHOUT AGAIN DISTRICT CAP AND

01:37:09.056 --> 01:37:09.823
WE THINK THAT'S A A SOLID MOVE

01:37:09.890 --> 01:37:12.526
TOWARD PARITY WITH MENTAL HEALTH

01:37:12.593 --> 01:37:13.060
AND AND OTHER HEALTH CARE

01:37:13.127 --> 01:37:14.161
SERVICES --

01:37:14.228 --> 01:37:15.462
I'LL WRAP UP MY COMMENTS ON THE

01:37:15.529 --> 01:37:16.997
HUB AND SPOKE SYSTEM WE THINK

01:37:17.064 --> 01:37:17.531
THIS IS BEEN A TREMENDOUS

01:37:17.598 --> 01:37:18.866
OPPORTUNITY --

01:37:18.933 --> 01:37:20.000
I'LL SPEAK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT

01:37:20.067 --> 01:37:20.868
THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY

01:37:20.935 --> 01:37:22.670
EXPERIENCE WE HAVE TWO LARGE

01:37:22.736 --> 01:37:23.804
SKILLED PROVIDERS THAT ARE

01:37:23.871 --> 01:37:25.272
SERVING AS HUBS RECRUITING

01:37:25.339 --> 01:37:27.308
SPOKES BOTH IN THE PRIMARY CARE

01:37:27.374 --> 01:37:28.676
AND MENTAL HEALTH --

01:37:28.742 --> 01:37:30.778
NETWORKS IN OUR COUNTY WE THINK

01:37:30.844 --> 01:37:32.313
THAT THEY'RE STEADILY INCREASING

01:37:32.379 --> 01:37:33.614
THE NUMBER OF PRESCRIBERS AND

01:37:33.681 --> 01:37:35.416
CLINICS THAT OFFER THAT SERVICE.

01:37:35.482 --> 01:37:36.850
AGAIN OUR OUR CONCERN AS YOU

01:37:36.917 --> 01:37:38.085
HEARD BEFORE SUSTAINABILITY

01:37:38.152 --> 01:37:39.420
WE'RE DOING WHAT WE CAN TO

01:37:39.486 --> 01:37:40.821
RECRUIT PROVIDERS TO EITHER

01:37:40.888 --> 01:37:42.590
BECOME OPA TREATMENT PROGRAMS

01:37:42.656 --> 01:37:45.459
WITH DNC CERTIFICATION OR BECOME.

01:37:45.526 --> 01:37:46.894
A A AN S. U. D. TREATMENT

01:37:46.961 --> 01:37:47.761
PROVIDER WITH THE MC

01:37:47.828 --> 01:37:49.363
CERTIFICATION AT THE OUTPATIENT

01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:51.098
LEVEL AND THEN LEVERAGE THE THE

01:37:51.165 --> 01:37:53.200
OTHER MEDI CAL BENEFITS TO

01:37:53.267 --> 01:37:54.835
PROVIDE THE MEDICATIONS.

01:37:54.902 --> 01:37:56.003
SO WITH THAT I'LL OF FINISHING

01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:57.404
JUST SAY THIS IS A AN INCREDIBLE

01:37:57.471 --> 01:37:58.872
GENERATION OPPORTUNITY THAT I

01:37:58.939 --> 01:38:01.709
WOULD ENCOURAGE ALL TO SUPPORT

01:38:01.775 --> 01:38:03.077
AND MAXIMIZE.

01:38:03.143 --> 01:38:05.246
THANK YOU THANK YOU DOCTOR

01:38:05.312 --> 01:38:06.313

GREAT SO GOOD MORNING JENNIFER

01:38:07.481 --> 01:38:08.148

01:38:08.215 --> 01:38:09.717
HEALTH CARE SERVICES --

01:38:09.783 --> 01:38:11.652
I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW A COUPLE

01:38:11.719 --> 01:38:13.220
THINGS ABOUT THE WAIVER AND THE

01:38:13.287 --> 01:38:14.788
WEAVER WAS.

01:38:14.855 --> 01:38:16.924
IMPLEMENTED IN AUGUST OF TWENTY

01:38:16.991 --> 01:38:18.392
FIFTEEN AND IMMEDIATELY --

01:38:18.459 --> 01:38:19.326
THAN JUST RENEWED WHEN WE WERE

01:38:19.393 --> 01:38:23.664
NEW THE WAIVER IN DECEMBER AND

01:38:23.731 --> 01:38:24.965
SOMETIMES.

01:38:25.032 --> 01:38:26.600
OUT OF GREAT CHALLENGES COME

01:38:26.667 --> 01:38:28.302
GREAT OPPORTUNITIES AND THAT IS

01:38:28.369 --> 01:38:29.670
EXACTLY HOW THE ODIOUS WE'VE

01:38:29.737 --> 01:38:30.704
ACTUALLY CAME TO BE IS THAT WE

01:38:30.771 --> 01:38:32.106
HAD A SIGNIFICANT PROGRAM

01:38:32.172 --> 01:38:33.907
INTEGRITY ISSUE IN THE DRUG

01:38:33.974 --> 01:38:34.608
MEDICAL PROGRAM WITH.

01:38:34.675 --> 01:38:37.611
FRAUDULENT PROVIDERS AND BECAUSE

01:38:37.678 --> 01:38:38.445
OF THAT.

01:38:38.512 --> 01:38:40.714
WE SAT AMONGST OURSELVES IN THIS

01:38:40.781 --> 01:38:41.882
WAS ACTUALLY PRIOR TO ME.

01:38:41.949 --> 01:38:42.683
BEING AT THE DEPARTMENT BUT

01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:44.485
MERRILEES CAN CERTAINLY CHIME IN

01:38:44.551 --> 01:38:45.819
HERE -- WE

01:38:45.886 --> 01:38:47.121
SAT AROUND AND SAID WHAT CAN WE

01:38:47.187 --> 01:38:48.656
DO.

01:38:48.722 --> 01:38:49.923
TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM BUT ALSO

01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:51.125
YOU KNOW RETURN SOME OF THE

01:38:51.191 --> 01:38:53.460
PROGRAM INTEGRITY TO THIS AND SO

01:38:53.527 --> 01:38:54.862
THE WAIVER THAT WE HAVE BEEN

01:38:54.928 --> 01:38:57.197
WORKING SO HARD ON IS THIS FIRST

01:38:57.264 --> 01:38:58.132
IN THE NATION.

01:38:58.198 --> 01:39:00.067
SO WE'RE INCREDIBLY PROUD OF

01:39:00.134 --> 01:39:01.802
WHAT WE HAVE PUT INTO PLACE WE

01:39:01.869 --> 01:39:03.570
ARE INCREDIBLY PROUD OF THE FACT

01:39:03.637 --> 01:39:04.938
THAT THESE BENEFITS.

01:39:05.005 --> 01:39:05.906
ARE AVAILABLE TO MEDI CAL

01:39:05.973 --> 01:39:07.074
RECIPIENTS --

01:39:07.141 --> 01:39:09.376
IN A MEANINGFUL WAY ACROSS A

01:39:09.443 --> 01:39:12.746
BROAD SPECTRUM OF NEED.

01:39:12.813 --> 01:39:15.516
AND SO I THINK THAT --

01:39:15.582 --> 01:39:16.817
WHAT YOU WILL HEAR FROM US IS

01:39:16.884 --> 01:39:20.187
NOT JUST FIVE YEAR DEMONSTRATION

01:39:20.254 --> 01:39:22.456
BASIS BUT ALWAYS WANTING --

01:39:22.523 --> 01:39:23.991
TO HIGHLIGHT THE BENEFITS THAT

01:39:24.058 --> 01:39:25.926
COME FROM THIS AS WELL AS OUR

01:39:25.993 --> 01:39:27.594
CONTINUED INTEREST IN HAVING

01:39:27.661 --> 01:39:28.462
THIS RENEWED WITH THE FEDERAL

01:39:28.529 --> 01:39:29.430
GOVERNMENT --

01:39:29.496 --> 01:39:31.265
WHEN THE WAIVER EXPIRES IN

01:39:31.332 --> 01:39:33.267
DECEMBER OF --

01:39:33.334 --> 01:39:34.368
TWENTY TWENTY I THINK THAT YOU

01:39:34.435 --> 01:39:35.936
KNOW TWO OF THE COUNTIES THAT WE

01:39:36.003 --> 01:39:38.772
ARE MOST PROUD OF ARE HERE --

01:39:38.839 --> 01:39:40.040
AND YOU HEARD FROM THEM ALREADY --

01:39:40.107 --> 01:39:41.775
RIVERSIDE IN LA HAVE DONE AN

01:39:41.842 --> 01:39:44.978
EXCEPTIONAL JOB IN NOT ONLY

01:39:45.045 --> 01:39:47.014
IMPLEMENTING BUT REALLY EMBRACE

01:39:47.081 --> 01:39:49.316
SCENE AND LEANING AND TO THE TO

01:39:49.383 --> 01:39:50.317
THE WORK THAT --

01:39:50.384 --> 01:39:51.819
IS REQUIRED TO BUILD UP THIS

01:39:51.885 --> 01:39:53.520
INFRASTRUCTURE AND CERTAINLY ALL

01:39:53.587 --> 01:39:54.355
OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY

01:39:54.421 --> 01:39:55.622
ACKNOWLEDGE ARE ALL CERTAINLY

01:39:55.689 --> 01:39:58.225
TRUE BUT I THINK YOU KNOW WE

01:39:58.292 --> 01:39:59.960
HAVE BEEN MOST --

01:40:00.027 --> 01:40:01.695
PROUD TO SEE THE RESPONSE --

01:40:01.762 --> 01:40:02.629
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE

01:40:02.696 --> 01:40:05.099
RIVERSIDE CALL VOLUME I THINK WE

01:40:05.165 --> 01:40:06.400
WERE CERTAINLY TAKEN ABACK --

01:40:06.467 --> 01:40:07.868
WHEN WE SAW AND WE FELT REALLY

01:40:07.935 --> 01:40:09.870
SORRY FOR THEM BECAUSE THAT WAS

01:40:09.937 --> 01:40:11.739
THEIR CALL VOLUME AND NOT OURS --

01:40:11.805 --> 01:40:13.907
BUT I THINK IT HAS ALSO BEEN A

01:40:13.974 --> 01:40:15.809
REALLY GREAT AND POSITIVE

01:40:15.876 --> 01:40:16.410
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL

01:40:16.477 --> 01:40:17.811
GOVERNMENT --

01:40:17.878 --> 01:40:20.547
BUT BECAUSE WE WERE THE FIRST --

01:40:20.614 --> 01:40:23.817
IN THE NATION WE WERE PROCESS

01:40:23.884 --> 01:40:25.285
WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND

01:40:25.352 --> 01:40:27.321
I'M SAYING THAT WITH SOME WHAT

01:40:27.388 --> 01:40:30.224
OF A NICE WAY BUT IT WAS A

01:40:30.290 --> 01:40:31.825
EXERCISE WILL PROCESS --

01:40:31.892 --> 01:40:33.527
TO GET THE CONTRACTS APPROVED

01:40:33.594 --> 01:40:35.028
THEY HAD TO GO NOT ONLY THROUGH

01:40:35.095 --> 01:40:36.397
US AND GO THROUGH THE COUNTIES

01:40:36.463 --> 01:40:37.131
AND BE APPROVED BY THE COUNTY

01:40:37.197 --> 01:40:38.432
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS BUT THEN

01:40:38.499 --> 01:40:39.466
THEY HAD TO GO BACK TO SEE EN

01:40:39.533 --> 01:40:41.402
MASSE AFTER ALL OF THAT FOR

01:40:41.468 --> 01:40:42.703
REVIEW AND APPROVAL --

01:40:42.770 --> 01:40:44.438
SO AGAIN WANTING TO MAKE SURE

01:40:44.505 --> 01:40:45.806
THAT IT'S RIGHT WANTING TO MAKE

01:40:45.873 --> 01:40:47.441
SURE THAT IT IS SUCCESSFUL YOU

01:40:47.508 --> 01:40:48.842
KNOW THERE HAS BEEN PARTNERSHIP

01:40:48.909 --> 01:40:50.878
WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN

01:40:50.944 --> 01:40:52.346
MAKING THAT HAPPEN --

01:40:52.413 --> 01:40:54.114
I WOULD ALSO BE REMISS IF I

01:40:54.181 --> 01:40:55.282
DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THE

01:40:55.349 --> 01:40:56.950
PARTNERSHIP THAT WE HAVE WITH

01:40:57.017 --> 01:40:57.418
OUTSIDE --

01:40:57.484 --> 01:40:59.086
INTO T. SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA

01:40:59.153 --> 01:41:00.754
HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION THEY HAVE

01:41:00.821 --> 01:41:02.089
BEEN EXCEPTIONAL PARTNERS AND

01:41:02.156 --> 01:41:04.258
HELPING US DO THE THINGS THAT WE

01:41:04.324 --> 01:41:05.292
NEEDED TO DO WITH THE COUNTIES

01:41:05.359 --> 01:41:06.994
IN ORDER TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL

01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:08.629
ASSISTANCE TO PROVIDE TRAINING.

01:41:08.695 --> 01:41:09.797
TO PROVIDE RESOURCES AND

01:41:09.863 --> 01:41:12.099
LEARNING COLLABORATIVE AND SO --

01:41:12.166 --> 01:41:14.601
THIS HAS NOT BEEN IN AN ISOLATED --

01:41:14.668 --> 01:41:15.869
VACUUM IN TERMS OF THE STATE AND

01:41:15.936 --> 01:41:17.271
THE COUNTIES JUST OFF DOING

01:41:17.337 --> 01:41:18.839
THEIR OWN THING IT HAS BEEN

01:41:18.906 --> 01:41:20.607
PROVIDERS AS YOU HAVE HEARD IT

01:41:20.674 --> 01:41:21.575
HAS BEEN COUNTIES IT HAS BEEN

01:41:21.642 --> 01:41:22.976
THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE

01:41:23.043 --> 01:41:24.478
FOUNDATION --

01:41:24.545 --> 01:41:26.513
IN YOUR PREVIOUS QUESTIONS

01:41:26.580 --> 01:41:28.015
AROUND PREVALENCE --

01:41:28.081 --> 01:41:29.516
I WOULD DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO A

01:41:29.583 --> 01:41:31.018
CH C. F. REPORT THAT WAS

01:41:31.084 --> 01:41:32.986
ACTUALLY ISSUED LAST FALL AROUND

01:41:33.053 --> 01:41:34.888
SUBSTANCE USE PROBABLY REDDING

01:41:34.955 --> 01:41:36.390
CALIFORNIA AROUND PREVALENCE

01:41:36.457 --> 01:41:37.491
STATISTICS.

01:41:37.558 --> 01:41:39.226
I THINK WHAT I WOULD ALSO LIKE

01:41:39.293 --> 01:41:40.627
TO HIGHLIGHT --

01:41:40.694 --> 01:41:41.929
BECAUSE I THINK WE ACKNOWLEDGE

01:41:41.995 --> 01:41:44.965
IT BUT IT'S IT GETS LOST IN THE

01:41:45.032 --> 01:41:45.766
YOU KNOW CURRENT --

01:41:45.833 --> 01:41:50.237
OPIOID DISCUSSIONS IS THAT.

01:41:50.304 --> 01:41:52.406
THE SUBSTANCE THAT IS MOST ABUSE

01:41:52.473 --> 01:41:54.775
IN ALL POPULATIONS AND SO YOU

01:41:54.842 --> 01:41:58.078
KNOW WHERE WE CAN WE TRY VERY

01:41:58.145 --> 01:42:00.314
HARD TO BUILD CAPACITY THAT IS

01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:01.715
NOT --

01:42:01.782 --> 01:42:03.984
SUBSTANCE SPECIFIC RIGHT SO YOU

01:42:04.051 --> 01:42:05.152
KNOW WHAT YOU WILL HEAR FROM OUR

01:42:05.219 --> 01:42:07.521
LEASE LATER ON IS THE THINGS

01:42:07.588 --> 01:42:09.523
THAT WE'RE DOING WITH THE SO ARE

01:42:09.590 --> 01:42:12.159
AND THE S. T. R. GRANT FUNDS --

01:42:12.226 --> 01:42:14.094
ARE OBVIOUSLY HAVING TO BE

01:42:14.161 --> 01:42:15.496
FOCUSED ON OPIATES BECAUSE

01:42:15.562 --> 01:42:16.196
THAT'S WHAT THE FEDERAL GRANT

01:42:16.263 --> 01:42:18.031
REQUIRES IT IS ALSO OUR

01:42:18.098 --> 01:42:19.433
INTENTION IN DOING THIS THAT WE

01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:20.767
ARE BUILDING CAPACITY.

01:42:20.834 --> 01:42:22.936
FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER

01:42:23.003 --> 01:42:25.138
TREATMENT SERVICES PROBABLY READ --

01:42:25.205 --> 01:42:27.441
THE ONLY OTHER THING --

01:42:27.508 --> 01:42:29.510
THAT I WOULD WILL US LEAVE YOU

01:42:29.576 --> 01:42:31.411
WITH IS NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE

01:42:31.478 --> 01:42:31.945
BEEN --

01:42:32.012 --> 01:42:33.680
POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE STATE'S

01:42:33.747 --> 01:42:35.682
WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY TO

01:42:35.749 --> 01:42:36.283
IMPLEMENT THE AFFORDABLE CARE

01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:37.117
ACT.

01:42:37.184 --> 01:42:39.920
SO THE ENHANCE MATCH AROUND THE

01:42:39.987 --> 01:42:41.655
MEDICAID EXPANSION POPULATION

01:42:41.722 --> 01:42:44.258
FOR SINGLE CHILDLESS ADULTS THE

01:42:44.324 --> 01:42:45.492
1100% AT THE START AND THEN

01:42:45.559 --> 01:42:46.760
OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE BEEN FACING

01:42:46.827 --> 01:42:48.595
DOWN AND IT WILL BE PERMANENTLY

01:42:48.662 --> 01:42:50.464
DOWN TO A NINETY TEN MATCH --

01:42:50.531 --> 01:42:51.865
MAKES THIS POSSIBLE FOR THE

01:42:51.932 --> 01:42:54.468
COUNTIES THE STATE PAYS FOR THAT

01:42:54.535 --> 01:42:55.769
10% -- OR

01:42:55.836 --> 01:42:58.171
WHAT IS THE YOU KNOW 8% NOW OUR

01:42:58.238 --> 01:42:59.940
WHATEVER FEES THAT WERE IN THE

01:43:00.007 --> 01:43:01.308
COUNTIES AREN'T PAYING FOR ANY

01:43:01.375 --> 01:43:02.876
OF THE OTIONAL EXPANSION NOR

01:43:02.943 --> 01:43:03.377
ARE THEY PAYING FOR THE

01:43:03.443 --> 01:43:04.311
RESIDENTIAL.

01:43:04.378 --> 01:43:06.013
PORTION OF THE BENEFIT BECAUSE

01:43:06.079 --> 01:43:07.581
THOSE COMPOST REALIGNMENT SO

01:43:07.648 --> 01:43:09.750
AGAIN WE AS A STATE HAVE

01:43:09.816 --> 01:43:11.318
PARTNERED WITH THE COUNTIES TO

01:43:11.385 --> 01:43:13.654
MAKE THIS A SUCCESSFUL --

01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:15.289
YOU KNOW ONGOING SERVICE

01:43:15.355 --> 01:43:17.024
DELIVERY MECHANISM AND SO WE AS

01:43:17.090 --> 01:43:18.158
A STATE HAVE BEEN OBVIOUSLY

01:43:18.225 --> 01:43:20.227
COMMITTED TO WORKING CLOSELY TO

01:43:20.294 --> 01:43:21.361
MAKE THAT --

01:43:21.428 --> 01:43:23.430
A REALITY AND THEN LASTLY I

01:43:23.497 --> 01:43:26.066
THINK -- TO

01:43:26.133 --> 01:43:28.802
YOUR COMMENT DOCTOR WOULD NOT

01:43:28.869 --> 01:43:30.704
INDICATED THAT THEY WANT TO BE A

01:43:30.771 --> 01:43:32.139
PART OF THE WAIVER I'M IT IS

01:43:32.205 --> 01:43:33.874
VOLUNTARY NATURE --

01:43:33.941 --> 01:43:35.809
SO WE WE CAN'T FORCE THE COUNTY

01:43:35.876 --> 01:43:39.246
TO PARTICIPATE ALTHOUGH WE HAVE

01:43:39.313 --> 01:43:41.415
THINK WE HAVE ALSO AS A

01:43:41.481 --> 01:43:42.950
DEPARTMENT REACHED OUT --

01:43:43.016 --> 01:43:43.750
TO LIKE THE COUNTY MEDICAL

01:43:43.817 --> 01:43:45.519

01:43:45.586 --> 01:43:47.087
THE FALL AND DID APRESENTATION

01:43:47.154 --> 01:43:49.022

THOSE THAT ARE NOT MEDICALLY.

01:43:57.698 --> 01:43:59.032
I MEDI CAL ELIGIBLE.

01:43:59.099 --> 01:44:00.701
I WOULD ENCOURAGE THEM TO THINK

01:44:00.767 --> 01:44:02.202
IN A WAY THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM

01:44:02.269 --> 01:44:03.937
TO OPERATE THE DRUG MEDI CAL

01:44:04.004 --> 01:44:05.138

BIOLOGICAL FLUID ANALYSIS

01:50:16.576 --> 01:50:17.110
BECAUSE IT'S STILL AN EVOLVING

01:50:17.177 --> 01:50:18.111
ART.

01:50:18.178 --> 01:50:19.446
AND WHEN YOU START DOING THAT

01:50:19.512 --> 01:50:20.647
POINT OF SERVICE --

01:50:20.714 --> 01:50:22.315
DRUG TESTING YOU FIND OUT

SO YOU HAVE TO DO THAT KIND OF

01:50:29.222 --> 01:50:30.223
THING AND THEN AND THEN THE

01:50:30.290 --> 01:50:35.028
COMPLEXITY OF THE MANAGEMENT

01:50:35.095 --> 01:50:36.596
BECOMES GREATER.

01:50:36.663 --> 01:50:37.630
WHO IS NOT AS SIMPLE AS JUST

01:50:37.697 --> 01:50:38.431
PRESCRIBING A MEDICATION?

01:50:38.498 --> 01:50:39.632

01:50:49.843 --> 01:50:51.911
SUBS USES ORDERS A BRAIN DISEASE

01:50:51.978 --> 01:50:53.546
AND LIKE ANY ANY DISEASE IT

01:50:53.613 --> 01:50:55.482
REQUIRES MONITORING MANAGEMENT

01:50:55.548 --> 01:50:57.884
CARE OVER THE OVER THE LIFE OF

GET AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE.

01:51:07.694 --> 01:51:08.995
A INTERESTED IN AS TO THE WILL

01:51:09.062 --> 01:51:10.764
HAVE TO LEARN OUTSIDE OF THE

01:51:10.830 --> 01:51:12.732
STANDARD CURRICULUM MINUTES AT

01:51:12.799 --> 01:51:13.900
THE VERY LEAST YOU WANNA RAISE

01:51:13.967 --> 01:51:15.135

ACCOUNTABILITY THAT WE CAN REFER

BEING A CARVED OUT ALWAYS BEING

01:52:29.809 --> 01:52:31.377
CARVED OUT OR IS THIS SOMETHING

THAT.

01:52:34.414 --> 01:52:35.648
WELL I THINK --

01:52:35.715 --> 01:52:38.184
BASED ON THE TWO THOUSAND AND

01:52:38.251 --> 01:52:39.452
ELEVEN REALIGNMENT --

01:52:39.519 --> 01:52:40.854
THAT WAS DONE OBVIOUSLY BETWEEN

01:52:40.920 --> 01:52:41.855
THE LEGISLATURE THE

01:52:41.921 --> 01:52:44.691
ADMINISTRATION AND THE VOTERS --

01:52:44.757 --> 01:52:47.627
THERE ARE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES --

01:52:47.694 --> 01:52:48.895
THAT.

01:52:48.962 --> 01:52:51.598
WOULD HAVE TO BE.

01:52:51.664 --> 01:52:53.333
AS DISCUSSED --

01:52:53.399 --> 01:52:55.268
IN TERMS OF TAKING.

01:52:55.335 --> 01:52:56.469
YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT A LOT OF

01:52:56.536 --> 01:52:57.804
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE CARVE OUT

01:52:57.871 --> 01:52:58.905
ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE BUT

01:52:58.972 --> 01:53:00.006
OBVIOUSLY SUBSTANCE USE IS ALSO

01:53:00.073 --> 01:53:01.474
CARVED OUT TO THE COUNTIES IN

01:53:01.541 --> 01:53:02.775
TERMS OF RESPONSIBILITY AND I

01:53:02.842 --> 01:53:03.710
KNOW THAT.

01:53:03.776 --> 01:53:04.844
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF INTEREST

01:53:04.911 --> 01:53:07.814
AND INTEGRATING AND AND TAKING

01:53:07.881 --> 01:53:09.916
THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES AND

01:53:09.983 --> 01:53:11.084
PUTTING THEM IN WITH --

01:53:11.151 --> 01:53:12.519
LARGER KIND OF PHYSICAL HEALTH

01:53:12.585 --> 01:53:14.154
PROGRAM --

01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:15.855
THE FUNDING IS A COMPLICATING

01:53:15.922 --> 01:53:17.157
FACTOR FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT

01:53:17.223 --> 01:53:18.191
THERE HAD THERE IS A

01:53:18.258 --> 01:53:21.227
CONSTITUTIONAL --

01:53:21.294 --> 01:53:22.629
THE VERSION OF FUNDING TO THE

01:53:22.695 --> 01:53:24.063
COUNTIES FOR THESE SPECIFIC

01:53:24.130 --> 01:53:26.466
ISSUES WHICH IS WHY THE ODS

01:53:26.533 --> 01:53:27.834
WAIVERS VOLUNTARY --

01:53:27.901 --> 01:53:30.036
SUCH THAT THE COUNTIES CAN OFTEN

01:53:30.103 --> 01:53:31.237
I'M AND THEN THEY'RE USING THEIR

01:53:31.304 --> 01:53:33.206
REALIGNMENT DOLLARS AND OTHER

01:53:33.273 --> 01:53:35.141
FUN SOURCES --

01:53:35.208 --> 01:53:36.376
TO DRIVE DOWN THE FEDERAL SHARE

01:53:36.442 --> 01:53:37.877
IN ADDITION TO OBVIOUSLY

01:53:37.944 --> 01:53:39.012
BLENDING IT WITH.

01:53:39.078 --> 01:53:40.079
STATE GENERAL FUND FOR BENEFITS

01:53:40.146 --> 01:53:41.681
THAT ARE OUR RESPONSIBILITY SO I

01:53:41.748 --> 01:53:43.283
THINK.

01:53:43.349 --> 01:53:45.685
THE WAY I APPROACH IT IS --

01:53:45.752 --> 01:53:46.452
THE PATIENT SHOULDN'T SEE

01:53:46.519 --> 01:53:49.489
THEMSELVES HATED AND THEY

01:53:49.556 --> 01:53:51.090
SHOULDN'T SEE THEMSELVES AS

01:53:51.157 --> 01:53:53.359
BEING IN A CARVE OUT BENEFIT AND

01:53:53.426 --> 01:53:55.128
IT'S REALLY UP TO US AS A STATE

01:53:55.195 --> 01:53:56.529
AND COUNTIES AND MANAGED CARE

01:53:56.596 --> 01:53:58.398
PLANS AND PROVIDERS. TO FIGURE

01:53:58.464 --> 01:54:00.233
OUT THE BACK AND INTEGRATION

01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:01.868
ISSUES AND NOT MAKE THE

01:54:01.935 --> 01:54:04.037
BENEFICIARY BE RIVER --

01:54:04.103 --> 01:54:05.471
COGNIZANT OF THAT --

01:54:05.538 --> 01:54:06.239
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE

01:54:06.306 --> 01:54:08.141
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES AROUND

01:54:08.208 --> 01:54:08.741
REALIGNMENT AND SOME OF THE

01:54:08.808 --> 01:54:10.076
OTHER YOU KNOW KIND OF

01:54:10.143 --> 01:54:11.778
HISTORICAL --

01:54:11.844 --> 01:54:13.379
WAYS THAT WE HAVE HANDLED THE

01:54:13.446 --> 01:54:15.248
DIVISION OF SERVICES BETWEEN

01:54:15.315 --> 01:54:16.216
STATE AND COUNTIES [inaudible]

01:54:16.282 --> 01:54:18.384
SO --

01:54:18.451 --> 01:54:20.053
RECOGNIZE A PARTNERSHIP IS IS

01:54:20.119 --> 01:54:21.688
TRYING TO ADMINISTER THE ODS

01:54:21.754 --> 01:54:22.755
BENEFIT AND SEVERAL COUNTIES

01:54:22.822 --> 01:54:24.257
HOW'S THAT GOING AND HOW DO YOU

01:54:24.324 --> 01:54:25.525
SEE THAT GOING FORWARD.

01:54:25.592 --> 01:54:26.826
SO OBVIOUSLY REPRESENTS THEY

01:54:26.893 --> 01:54:27.994
THEY WORK WITH SMALL SOME OF THE

01:54:28.061 --> 01:54:29.395
SMALL COUNTIES WHERE WE'RE

01:54:29.462 --> 01:54:30.463
SEEING SOME OF THE TRACKS SOME

01:54:30.530 --> 01:54:31.965
OF THESE CHALLENGES SO HOW DO

01:54:32.031 --> 01:54:32.999
YOU SEE THIS GOING FORWARD SO I

01:54:33.066 --> 01:54:34.801
PARTNERSHIP IS BEEN WORKING WITH.

01:54:34.867 --> 01:54:36.703
EIGHT COUNTIES OF THEIR FOURTEEN

01:54:36.769 --> 01:54:38.671
COUNTIES IN THEIR SERVICE AREA --

01:54:38.738 --> 01:54:40.440
IT HAS BEEN CHALLENGING I THINK

01:54:40.506 --> 01:54:42.542
WE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME AND

01:54:42.609 --> 01:54:44.844
THEY HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME --

01:54:44.911 --> 01:54:46.112
TRYING TO WORK THROUGH RATE

01:54:46.179 --> 01:54:49.249
ISSUES SO THAT HAS BEEN THE REAL --

01:54:49.315 --> 01:54:52.919
CHALLENGE BECAUSE EACH COUNTY

01:54:52.986 --> 01:54:54.487
HAS TO FUNDS.

01:54:54.554 --> 01:54:55.488
THE OF THE PART OF THE RATE THAT

01:54:55.555 --> 01:54:57.423
GOES TO PARTNERSHIP AND HOW DO

01:54:57.490 --> 01:54:58.791
THEY SET THAT RAY AND THEN WE

01:54:58.858 --> 01:54:59.892
HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RATE AND

01:54:59.959 --> 01:55:00.994
MAKE SURE THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE

01:55:01.060 --> 01:55:02.095
BEFORE IT GOES TO THE FEDERAL

01:55:02.161 --> 01:55:03.730
GOVERNMENT FOR REVIEW.

01:55:03.796 --> 01:55:05.098
AND THERE HAS JUST BEEN A LOT A

01:55:05.164 --> 01:55:07.834
LOT OF COMPLEXITY AROUND THAT.

01:55:07.900 --> 01:55:09.569
FUND SOURCE AND WHO'S PAYING FOR

01:55:09.636 --> 01:55:11.638
WHAT AND AND IS IT IN THE RATE

01:55:11.704 --> 01:55:13.740
AND HOW DID YOU KNOW IT HAS BEEN

01:55:13.806 --> 01:55:15.608
A WORK IN PROGRESS --

01:55:15.675 --> 01:55:17.043
I THINK THAT WE HAVE MADE SOME

01:55:17.110 --> 01:55:18.278
GOOD --

01:55:18.344 --> 01:55:19.912
HEADWAY --

01:55:19.979 --> 01:55:20.513
FROM THE LAST I HEARD WE THINK

01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:24.317
WE MAY GO WITH THEM --

01:55:24.384 --> 01:55:25.251
I THINK THAT THE OTHER

01:55:25.318 --> 01:55:27.020
ALTERNATIVE IS THE ONE THAT I

01:55:27.086 --> 01:55:28.621
MENTIONED EARLIER CMS P. WOULD

01:55:28.688 --> 01:55:30.223
ALSO IN CAPSULE LATE THOSE

01:55:30.290 --> 01:55:32.125
COUNTIES IF THE FOR WHATEVER

01:55:32.191 --> 01:55:34.093
REASON THE PARTNERSHIP --

01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:36.462
PROCESS DOESN'T PLAY OUT PLUS

01:55:36.529 --> 01:55:38.164
THE CMS P. HAS A BROADER NETWORK

01:55:38.231 --> 01:55:39.532
OF COUNTIES THAT ARE NOT IN CAP

01:55:39.599 --> 01:55:40.533
SLATED IN THAT PARTNERSHIP

01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:42.368
ARRANGEMENT BUT I THINK WE'RE

01:55:42.435 --> 01:55:44.604
TRYING AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. TO

01:55:44.671 --> 01:55:46.072
EITHER PUSH FOR REGIONAL

01:55:46.139 --> 01:55:48.508
APPROACHES OR TO PUSH FOR A MORE

01:55:48.574 --> 01:55:51.210
INTEGRATED WEIGH EVEN --

01:55:51.277 --> 01:55:52.745
AS YOU KNOW AS I SAID TRYING TO

01:55:52.812 --> 01:55:54.681
DO THE BACKEND INTEGRATION WITH

01:55:54.747 --> 01:55:56.015
EACH OTHER RATHER THAN MAKING

01:55:56.082 --> 01:55:59.018
THE BENEFICIARY BE PART OF A

01:55:59.085 --> 01:56:00.320
BIFURCATED SYSTEM.

01:56:00.386 --> 01:56:01.788
GOOD SO WHAT HAPPENS IF THE

01:56:01.854 --> 01:56:03.022
FUNDING RUNS OUT [inaudible]

01:56:03.089 --> 01:56:05.925
WHO?

01:56:05.992 --> 01:56:08.027
I HAD A ONE ANSWER THAT QUESTION

01:56:08.094 --> 01:56:08.328
[inaudible]

01:56:08.394 --> 01:56:09.629
OKAY.

01:56:09.696 --> 01:56:12.031
I PREFER TO LIVE IN THE REALITY

01:56:12.098 --> 01:56:14.033
THAT WE HAVE TODAY WHICH IS WE

01:56:14.100 --> 01:56:15.735
HAVE FEDERAL FUNDS WE HAVE STATE

01:56:15.802 --> 01:56:17.937
FUNDS WE HAVE LOTS OF RESOURCES

01:56:18.004 --> 01:56:20.506
AND WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS AND

01:56:20.573 --> 01:56:21.808
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT

01:56:21.874 --> 01:56:23.376
CHANGES IN ANY WAY --

01:56:23.443 --> 01:56:25.144
I WILL.

01:56:25.211 --> 01:56:28.414
DEFER TO YOUR WISDOM

01:56:28.481 --> 01:56:28.715
[inaudible]

01:56:28.781 --> 01:56:30.516
OKAY.

01:56:30.583 --> 01:56:32.518
I I WOULD.

01:56:32.585 --> 01:56:34.153
I WILL ASK ONE REALLY REFRESHING

01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:35.488
YOU MENTIONED A LOT OF

01:56:35.555 --> 01:56:37.523
COLLABORATION CHS HAVE.

01:56:37.590 --> 01:56:39.959
YOU DIDN'T MENTION THE PH SO WAS

01:56:40.026 --> 01:56:41.828
THAT WAS AT ASSUME THERE'S

01:56:41.894 --> 01:56:42.328
CORPORATION WITH PEOPLE

01:56:42.395 --> 01:56:44.430
ABSOLUTELY NO I WAS TALKING JUST

01:56:44.497 --> 01:56:45.465
AS IT PERTAINS TO LIKE ODS

01:56:45.531 --> 01:56:46.299
WAIVER.

01:56:46.366 --> 01:56:48.201
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF WORK

01:56:48.267 --> 01:56:50.303
ACROSS THE STATE DEPARTMENTS OF

01:56:50.370 --> 01:56:51.471
OTHERS AS IT PERTAINS TO THE

01:56:51.537 --> 01:56:53.906
OPIOID COALITION WE HAVE BEEN

01:56:53.973 --> 01:56:55.308
WORKING WITH THE PH ON SOME OF

01:56:55.375 --> 01:56:57.143
THE USE OF THE S. T. R. AND SO

01:56:57.210 --> 01:56:58.144
ARE GRANTS.

01:56:58.211 --> 01:56:59.712
THAT HELP THEM DO SURVEILLANCE

01:56:59.779 --> 01:57:01.114
AND MONITORING --

01:57:01.180 --> 01:57:02.682
I THINK WE'RE VERY PROUD AND WE

01:57:02.749 --> 01:57:03.783
USE IT -- A

01:57:03.850 --> 01:57:05.284
LOT IN TERMS OF THE DASHBOARD

01:57:05.351 --> 01:57:06.619
THAT THEY HAVE CREATED IN TERMS

01:57:06.686 --> 01:57:09.722
OF ALL OF THOSE --

01:57:09.789 --> 01:57:12.592
REALLY HELPFUL WAYS FOR HOW WE

01:57:12.658 --> 01:57:14.060
SO A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT ARE

01:57:14.127 --> 01:57:15.828
LEASES DONE IN TERMS OF THE VERY

01:57:15.895 --> 01:57:17.096
TARGETED PROJECTS.

01:57:17.163 --> 01:57:18.331
HAVE BEEN DRIVEN BY THE FACT

01:57:18.398 --> 01:57:19.532
THAT WE CAN LOOK AT THE DATA

01:57:19.599 --> 01:57:21.167
THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

01:57:21.234 --> 01:57:22.402
HEALTH IS PUT UP ON THEIR OPA

01:57:22.468 --> 01:57:23.936
DASHBOARD TO SAY WHERE ARE

01:57:24.003 --> 01:57:24.804
HIGHEST.

01:57:24.871 --> 01:57:26.639
RISK COUNTIES AND YOU KNOW

01:57:26.706 --> 01:57:27.507
OBVIOUSLY AS YOU KNOW THERE UP

01:57:27.573 --> 01:57:29.509
IN THE UPPER NORTH BUT I THINK A

01:57:29.575 --> 01:57:32.211
LOT OF WORK IS GONE IN WITH THEM.

01:57:32.278 --> 01:57:33.646
AROUND --

01:57:33.713 --> 01:57:35.348
ACADEMIC DETAILING AND THERE'S

01:57:35.415 --> 01:57:36.249
SOME OTHER PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE

01:57:36.315 --> 01:57:37.750
BEEN COLLABORATING WITH THEM ON

01:57:37.817 --> 01:57:39.552
AND THEN OBVIOUSLY WE'VE BEEN IN

01:57:39.619 --> 01:57:40.653
CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM AROUND.

01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:42.555
PROP SIXTY FOUR AND YOU KNOW WE

01:57:42.622 --> 01:57:44.991
HAVE COLLABORATION THAT IS BEING

01:57:45.057 --> 01:57:47.660
BUILT THERE AS WELL.

01:57:47.727 --> 01:57:49.462
AND I MENTIONED THAT --

01:57:49.529 --> 01:57:51.564
THE P. H. WAS THERE BECOMING UP

01:57:51.631 --> 01:57:52.165
LATER -- AS

01:57:52.231 --> 01:57:53.566
WELL SO LOOKING FORTY HEARING

01:57:53.633 --> 01:57:56.469
FROM THEM ALSO APPRECIATE --

01:57:56.536 --> 01:57:57.804
BUT BOTH SWISS AND DISCOUNT THE

01:57:57.870 --> 01:58:00.473
PREVIOUS PANEL THAT ALTHOUGH OUR

01:58:00.540 --> 01:58:03.176
FOCUS IS OFTEN OPIOIDS IT REALLY

01:58:03.242 --> 01:58:05.378
IS ABOUT SUBSTANCE USE.

01:58:05.445 --> 01:58:05.812
TREATMENT RIGHT --

01:58:05.878 --> 01:58:07.079
ITSELF.

01:58:07.146 --> 01:58:08.247
OKAY CERTAINLY ONE BUT WE'VE

01:58:08.314 --> 01:58:09.749
ALSO HERE DOES A SHIFT FROM

01:58:09.816 --> 01:58:11.317
OPIOIDS TOWARD.

01:58:11.384 --> 01:58:14.487
THAT AS WERE CLAMPING DOWN

01:58:14.554 --> 01:58:17.790
OPIOIDS TOWARD MATH AND

01:58:17.857 --> 01:58:18.291
SEPTEMBER.

01:58:18.357 --> 01:58:19.258
MCCARTY.

01:58:19.325 --> 01:58:20.793
I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON DOCTOR

01:58:20.860 --> 01:58:22.028
WOULD QUESTION ABOUT FUNDING BUT

01:58:22.094 --> 01:58:24.163
I JUST WANTED TO ASK ABOUT YOU

01:58:24.230 --> 01:58:27.366
AND THE AND THAT THE WORK FORCE

01:58:27.433 --> 01:58:29.135
AND THEN THE PROVIDERS I KNOW WE

01:58:29.202 --> 01:58:31.971
HAVE A GRAY CAT HE INTEREST

01:58:32.038 --> 01:58:34.173
RIGHT HERE AND AND JUST TO JUST

01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:34.674
LEFT THE ROOM SO DON'T.

01:58:34.740 --> 01:58:37.477
ALWAYS IN A POINT AT THEIR

01:58:37.543 --> 01:58:38.711
PROFESSIONALS BY --

01:58:38.778 --> 01:58:39.479
BUT AS FAR AS YOU KNOW THEN

01:58:39.545 --> 01:58:42.949
BEING ABLE. TO TO FOCUS ON THE

01:58:43.015 --> 01:58:45.551
TREATMENT SIDE THE X. WAIVERS

01:58:45.618 --> 01:58:47.420
NOT ALWAYS --

01:58:47.487 --> 01:58:49.489
READILY AVAILABLE AND NOR TO

01:58:49.555 --> 01:58:51.290
PEOPLE IN THE PROFESSION.

01:58:51.357 --> 01:58:52.892
HAVE THAT TRICK TRAINING IF YOU

01:58:52.959 --> 01:58:54.794
ASK PEOPLE IN ON THE STREET

01:58:54.861 --> 01:58:55.661
ABOUT THIS ISSUE THOUGH FIVE

01:58:55.728 --> 01:58:58.397
SCRATCH THEIR HEAD RELATED SO

01:58:58.464 --> 01:59:00.066
EASY FOR SOMEONE TO PRESCRIBE.

01:59:00.132 --> 01:59:01.300
BY COULD IN OXYCONTIN SO FORTH

01:59:01.367 --> 01:59:03.803
BUT SO DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO

01:59:03.870 --> 01:59:05.004
PRESCRIBE.

01:59:05.071 --> 01:59:06.839
THE MEDICATION TO GET OFF OF

01:59:06.906 --> 01:59:08.941
THEIR ADDICTION SO --

01:59:09.008 --> 01:59:10.776
HAVE WE SEEN ANY ANY CHANGE TO

01:59:10.843 --> 01:59:12.545
THAT I KNOW WE WE WORK TO

01:59:12.612 --> 01:59:16.115
LEGISLATION LAST YEAR AND SENATE

01:59:16.182 --> 01:59:16.716
HEALTH CLAIM ASSEMBLY HEALTH

01:59:16.782 --> 01:59:18.251
COMMITTEE HELPS GET ACROSS THE

01:59:18.317 --> 01:59:19.652
FINISH LINE TO ADDRESS THAT.

01:59:19.719 --> 01:59:20.920
SO IS THERE ANY.

01:59:20.987 --> 01:59:22.255
ANY REASON TO BE OPTIMISTIC THAT

01:59:22.321 --> 01:59:23.523
WE'RE SEEING MORE PEOPLE IN THE

01:59:23.589 --> 01:59:25.558
WORK FORCE.

01:59:25.625 --> 01:59:26.592
READY TO STEP UP FROM THE STREET

01:59:26.659 --> 01:59:27.994
INSIDE.

01:59:28.060 --> 01:59:29.061
YEAH SO YOU BROUGHT UP SOME

01:59:29.128 --> 01:59:31.197
EXCELLENT POINTS AND JUST TO BE

01:59:31.264 --> 01:59:32.331
CLEAR FOR THOSE THAT AREN'T

01:59:32.398 --> 01:59:33.533
AWARE OF THE X. WAVERED AS A

01:59:33.599 --> 01:59:35.067
FEDERAL REQUIREMENT --

01:59:35.134 --> 01:59:36.102
AND SOME OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS

01:59:36.168 --> 01:59:37.370
HAVE BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD BY

01:59:37.436 --> 01:59:39.238
VARIOUS STATES QUESTIONING WHY

01:59:39.305 --> 01:59:41.407
CAN ANY DOCTOR PRESCRIBED AN

01:59:41.474 --> 01:59:42.708
OPIOID THAT'S HIGHLY ADDICTIVE

01:59:42.775 --> 01:59:43.709
BUT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH

01:59:43.776 --> 01:59:45.311
SPECIALIZED TRAINING TO PROVIDE

01:59:45.378 --> 01:59:46.512
THE SOLUTION --

01:59:46.579 --> 01:59:47.380
SO I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

01:59:47.446 --> 01:59:49.882
TALKS ON THAT IS A FEDERAL ISSUE --

01:59:49.949 --> 01:59:51.117
THAT BEING SAID WE'RE WORKING

01:59:51.183 --> 01:59:53.319
WITHIN THOSE PRE THE OTHER

01:59:53.386 --> 01:59:54.787
PROJECTS I HAVEN'T MENTIONED

01:59:54.854 --> 01:59:55.821
THAT WE'RE DOING SOME.

01:59:55.888 --> 01:59:58.090
LARGE MIT WORK FOR SUMMITS --

01:59:58.157 --> 01:59:59.592
THIS SUMMER THAT ARE FREE OF

01:59:59.659 --> 02:00:01.260
CHARGE CAN GET SEE USE SOME

02:00:01.327 --> 02:00:02.361
FOLKS CAN COME IN AND LEARN

02:00:02.428 --> 02:00:04.463
ABOUT HOW TO PRESCRIBE MATC --

02:00:04.530 --> 02:00:06.198
THE TRAINING FOR PEOPLE MORPHINE

02:00:06.265 --> 02:00:07.867
IS NOW YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET IT

02:00:07.934 --> 02:00:10.069
ONLINE FOR FREE SO WE'RE MAKING

02:00:10.136 --> 02:00:11.704
SYSTEMS AWARE OF THAT --

02:00:11.771 --> 02:00:12.905
WE'VE EEN DOING A LOT OF WORK

02:00:12.972 --> 02:00:14.240
WITH PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS

02:00:14.307 --> 02:00:15.741
HELPING THEM INCREASE THE NUMBER

02:00:15.808 --> 02:00:17.209
OF PRESCRIBERS --

02:00:17.276 --> 02:00:18.911
BUT WHAT WE'RE FINDING AND OTHER

02:00:18.978 --> 02:00:20.947
STATES HAVE FOUND IS IT'S ONE

02:00:21.013 --> 02:00:22.348
THING TO GET AN AXE WAIVER

02:00:22.415 --> 02:00:24.150
THAT'S GREAT THAT DOESN'T THAT

02:00:24.216 --> 02:00:25.484
REALLY ISN'T A SOLUTION IT'S

02:00:25.551 --> 02:00:26.018
PART OF IT.

02:00:26.085 --> 02:00:27.420
IT'S PROVIDING THAT MENTORING

02:01:40.860 --> 02:01:41.761
DISORDER.

OKAY THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR

02:01:43.162 --> 02:01:44.797
DIRECTOR CAN'T BACK TO DOCTOR

02:01:44.864 --> 02:01:46.232
WOODS QUESTION ON THE FUNDING

AND YOU'RE SAYING WE'RE VERY

02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:49.568
HOPEFUL THAT WE WON'T HAVE TO

02:01:49.635 --> 02:01:51.437
LOOK FOR IT EITHER.

02:01:51.504 --> 02:01:52.672
A SOURCE AND YOU KNOW STATE

02:01:52.738 --> 02:01:54.306
FUNDING IN IN THE IN THE BUDGET

02:01:54.373 --> 02:01:55.741
OF COURSE IS MORE TIGHT THIS

02:01:55.808 --> 02:01:57.910
YEAR BUT EVEN IF IT WAS LAST

02:01:57.977 --> 02:01:59.078
YEAR THERE ARE STILL SO MANY

02:01:59.145 --> 02:02:00.413
OTHER PRIORITIES THAT.

02:02:00.479 --> 02:02:02.248
THAT WE KNOW WHAT THE TO FOCUS

02:02:02.314 --> 02:02:03.149
ON AS WELL.

02:02:03.215 --> 02:02:06.919
SO SO THAT BEING SAID IN THIS.

02:02:06.986 --> 02:02:07.186
IN THIS --

02:02:07.253 --> 02:02:10.389
IS THIS YOUR YET OUR POINT

02:02:10.456 --> 02:02:12.124
YEAH SURE YES YES IT IS THAT

02:02:12.191 --> 02:02:12.858
THERE'S THERE'S TWO POTS OF

02:02:12.925 --> 02:02:14.960
MONEY HERE ONE IS THAT THE

02:02:15.027 --> 02:02:16.395
TARGET A RESPONSE.

02:02:16.462 --> 02:02:18.130
HE SAID ONCE THE THANK THE

02:02:18.197 --> 02:02:19.765
GRANTED CELL ONCE NINETY MILLION

02:02:19.832 --> 02:02:21.200
OVER TWO YEARS AND ONCE ONE

02:02:21.267 --> 02:02:23.135
FORTY OVER TWO YEARS AND SO --

02:02:23.202 --> 02:02:24.937
THAT THE WORK THAT WE HEARD ON

02:02:25.004 --> 02:02:27.640
THE PRIOR PANELS ESSENTIALLY IS

02:02:27.707 --> 02:02:29.341
AS PART OF THIS YES --

02:02:29.408 --> 02:02:31.010
FUNDING STREAMS OUT IF IF THIS

02:02:31.077 --> 02:02:33.179
WENT AWAY ALL OF THAT --

02:02:33.245 --> 02:02:33.846
POTENTIALLY WOULD BE A

02:02:33.913 --> 02:02:35.748
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE WORK

02:02:35.815 --> 02:02:37.516
HAT MARLEY SPOKE TO IN TERMS OF

02:02:37.583 --> 02:02:38.918
ALL THE PROJECTS AND HUB AND

02:02:38.984 --> 02:02:40.553
SPOKE AND THE NALOXONE

02:02:40.619 --> 02:02:41.654
DISTRIBUTION.

02:02:41.721 --> 02:02:45.357
THAT IS ALL BEEN FUNDED BY THOSE

02:02:45.424 --> 02:02:48.928
TWO FEDERAL GRAY BUDGET THAT WAS --

02:02:48.994 --> 02:02:50.629
ANNOUNCED EARLIER THIS WEEK THAT

02:02:50.696 --> 02:02:52.765
WAS ONE OF THE POSITIVE THINGS

02:02:52.832 --> 02:02:53.966
IN THE BUDGET --

02:02:54.033 --> 02:02:55.000
IS IN USE IT IN THE SENATE IT

02:02:55.067 --> 02:02:56.869
EXTENDS FUNDING FOR MULTIPLE

02:02:56.936 --> 02:03:00.272
YEARS IT HAS A VARIETY OF

02:03:00.339 --> 02:03:04.477
OPTIONS FOR STATES TO USE AROUND --

02:03:04.543 --> 02:03:06.011
WOMEN WITH OPIOID DISORDER SO I

02:03:06.078 --> 02:03:07.413
THINK WE'RE STILL KIND OF

02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:10.116
UNPACKING THE THE DOCUMENT TO

02:03:10.182 --> 02:03:11.550
SOMEHOW DETAIL AND SOME DIDN'T

02:03:11.617 --> 02:03:14.019
BUT WE HAD BEEN --

02:03:14.086 --> 02:03:15.988
ADVISE THROUGH OUR CONTACTS OF

02:03:16.055 --> 02:03:17.056
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT THEY

02:03:17.123 --> 02:03:18.791
WERE LIKELY TO EXTEND THE GRANT

02:03:18.858 --> 02:03:19.892
FUNDING --

02:03:19.959 --> 02:03:21.560
FOR MULTIPLE YEARS AND SO THAT

02:03:21.627 --> 02:03:22.294
JUST MEANS THAT --

02:03:22.361 --> 02:03:23.596
OUR LEASE HAS TO THINK OF MORE

02:03:23.662 --> 02:03:25.164
PROJECTS --

02:03:25.231 --> 02:03:26.599
TO FUND IN THE STATE SO IT'S A

02:03:26.665 --> 02:03:29.335
CRITICAL RESOURCE IT WILL COME

02:03:29.401 --> 02:03:30.936
TO AN END AT SOME POINT BUT FOR

02:03:31.003 --> 02:03:33.072
NOW THERE'S MULTIPLE YEARS OF

02:03:33.139 --> 02:03:34.073
GRANT FUNDING.

02:03:34.140 --> 02:03:35.307
AND SOMETIMES WHEN STATES DON'T

02:03:35.374 --> 02:03:36.942
SPEND THEIR ALLOCATION THEY WILL

02:03:37.009 --> 02:03:38.477
GO BACK TO OTHER STATES AND SAY

02:03:38.544 --> 02:03:40.146
DO YOU WANT ANOTHER YOU KNOW DO

02:03:40.212 --> 02:03:41.647
YOU NEED US AND SO THERE'S

02:03:41.714 --> 02:03:44.216
OFTENTIMES REALLOCATION OF UNDER

02:03:44.283 --> 02:03:45.684
SPENT FUNDS AND THEN.

02:03:45.751 --> 02:03:46.886
THE FUNDING AROUND MEDICAID

02:03:46.952 --> 02:03:49.155
OBVIOUSLY IS SO CRITICAL BECAUSE

02:03:49.221 --> 02:03:50.456
IT'S AN ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM AND

02:03:50.523 --> 02:03:52.658
FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT WE PUT IN

02:03:52.725 --> 02:03:53.793
AS A STATE --

02:03:53.859 --> 02:03:54.994
WE GET A DOLLAR FROM THE FEDERAL

02:03:55.060 --> 02:03:56.395
GOVERNMENT FOR WHATEVER THOSE

02:03:56.462 --> 02:03:57.997
SERVICES NEED TO BEAND SO

02:03:58.063 --> 02:04:00.833
THAT'S KIND OF MORE OF MY THAT'S

02:04:00.900 --> 02:04:02.468
THE PART THAT IS MUCH HARDER TO

02:04:02.535 --> 02:04:04.069
MAKE UP OBVIOUSLY IF THERE'S A

02:04:04.136 --> 02:04:05.404
FEDERAL CHANGE OF THAT KIND OF

02:04:05.471 --> 02:04:05.671
FUNDING.

02:04:05.738 --> 02:04:09.875
SO BESIDES POTENTIALLY LOSING IT

02:04:09.942 --> 02:04:12.444
RIVERSIDE.

02:04:12.511 --> 02:04:15.447
AND THE OTHER.

02:04:15.514 --> 02:04:17.082
ONE LOS ANGELES THE IDEA THAT

02:04:17.149 --> 02:04:17.650
PEOPLE SLIPPING THROUGH THE

02:04:17.716 --> 02:04:18.751
CRACKS.

02:04:18.818 --> 02:04:20.152
THAT THERE IS --

02:04:20.219 --> 02:04:21.420
A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE

02:04:21.487 --> 02:04:23.656
BENEFITING BUT A LOT OF NEED OUT

02:04:23.722 --> 02:04:25.558
THERE SO IS THERE ANY --

02:04:25.624 --> 02:04:27.126
QUANTIFIABLE INFORMATION AT THAT

02:04:27.193 --> 02:04:29.962
TALKS ABOUT HOW MUCH MORE.

02:04:30.029 --> 02:04:33.666
IS IS NEEDED TO TO BASICALLY --

02:04:33.732 --> 02:04:35.835
AT WRAP UP THE PROGRAMS THAT WE

02:04:35.901 --> 02:04:37.369
ALREADY YEAH SO I HAVE.

02:04:37.436 --> 02:04:39.238
I HAVE SOME OLD DATA --

02:04:39.305 --> 02:04:41.607
THAT HASN'T BEEN UPDATED SINCE

02:04:41.674 --> 02:04:42.908
LAST TIME I PULLED IT BUT JUST

02:04:42.975 --> 02:04:45.744
FROM A MAGNIFICATION OF FUNDS --

02:04:45.811 --> 02:04:47.313
I'LL USE RIVERSIDE LOS ANGELES

02:04:47.379 --> 02:04:49.248
OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THEY TESTIFIED

02:04:49.315 --> 02:04:51.250
SO BASED ON WHEN WE RAN CLAIMS

02:04:51.317 --> 02:04:52.518
AND DOLLARS --

02:04:52.585 --> 02:04:55.054
FOR RIVERSIDE THEY PUT IN TWO

02:04:55.120 --> 02:04:56.488
POINT ONE MILLION OF THEIR OWN

02:04:56.555 --> 02:04:59.024
MONEY -- THE

02:04:59.091 --> 02:05:01.927
STATE PUT IN FOUR POINT.

02:05:01.994 --> 02:05:03.395
FIVE AND THEY DREW DOWN TWENTY

02:05:03.462 --> 02:05:04.797
SIX MILLION AND FEDERAL FUNDS

02:05:04.864 --> 02:05:06.665
AND DELIVERED THIRTY THREE

02:05:06.732 --> 02:05:07.900
MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE SERVICES.

02:05:07.967 --> 02:05:09.568
SO FOR TWO POINT ONE MILLION

02:05:09.635 --> 02:05:11.804
THAT RIVERSIDE PUT IN THEY GOT

02:05:11.871 --> 02:05:12.705
THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS

02:05:12.771 --> 02:05:13.672
WORTH OF SERVICES THE

02:05:13.739 --> 02:05:15.274
MAGNIFICATION.

02:05:15.341 --> 02:05:17.610
OF THOSE DOLLARS IS WHAT HAS

02:05:17.676 --> 02:05:18.944
BEEN SO CRITICAL AND I THINK

02:05:19.011 --> 02:05:20.813
THAT THAT CERTAINLY WHAT THE

02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:22.214
COUNTY IS REFERRING TO IS IS.

02:05:22.281 --> 02:05:23.883
THE CREATION OF THIS DELIVERY

02:05:23.949 --> 02:05:25.951
SYSTEM ALLOWS THEM THE CAPACITY

02:05:26.018 --> 02:05:27.553
TO BE ABLE TO TAKE PEOPLE WHEN

02:05:27.620 --> 02:05:29.021
THEY COME AND SAY I NEED HELP.

02:05:29.088 --> 02:05:30.689
THAT IT USED TO BE WELL I DON'T

02:05:30.756 --> 02:05:32.391
HAVE YOU KNOW I HAVE A SUBSTANCE

02:05:32.458 --> 02:05:34.159
ABUSE BLOCK GRANT AND IT'S ONLY.

02:05:34.226 --> 02:05:35.294
YOU KNOW EIGHT HER THOUSAND

02:05:35.361 --> 02:05:36.862
DOLLARS A YEAR AND I CAN'T FIND

02:05:36.929 --> 02:05:38.631
ANYTHING ELSE AFTER THAT.

02:05:38.697 --> 02:05:40.699
THIS BASICALLY SAYS FOR EVERY

02:05:40.766 --> 02:05:42.268
PERSON THAT COMES TO THE COUNTY

02:05:42.334 --> 02:05:43.035
AND SAYS I'M A MEDICARE

02:05:43.102 --> 02:05:44.570
RECIPIENT I MEET MEDICAL

02:05:44.637 --> 02:05:46.472
NECESSITY CRITERIA THE COUNTY

02:05:46.538 --> 02:05:48.340
HAS A PLACE FOR THEM AND THEY

02:05:48.407 --> 02:05:49.241
HAVE A FUN SOURCE THAT GOES TO

02:05:49.308 --> 02:05:51.877
TOWARDS THAT I MEAN LOS ANGELES --

02:05:51.944 --> 02:05:53.445
ON THE STATE AND THEY PUT IN TEN

02:05:53.512 --> 02:05:54.947
MILLION OF THEIR OWN MONEY.

02:05:55.014 --> 02:05:55.981
EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION IN

02:05:56.048 --> 02:05:58.050
STATE GENERAL FUND SIXTY MILLION

02:05:58.117 --> 02:06:00.653
AND FEDERAL FUNDS SO FOR TEN

02:06:00.719 --> 02:06:01.987
MILLION INVESTMENT BY THE COUNTY

02:06:02.054 --> 02:06:03.155
THEY GOT EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS

02:06:03.222 --> 02:06:04.523
WITH THE SERVICES --

02:06:04.590 --> 02:06:06.225
AND SO THAT HAS BEEN --

02:06:06.292 --> 02:06:07.760
THAT CANNOT BE --

02:06:07.826 --> 02:06:08.894
UNDERSTATED IN TERMS OF HOW

02:06:08.961 --> 02:06:10.229
IMPORTANT IT IS TO HELP YOU MEET

02:06:10.296 --> 02:06:11.997
THE NEED AND AGAIN YOU HAVE TO

02:06:12.064 --> 02:06:13.499
GET PEOPLE IN THE DOOR AND THEY

02:06:13.565 --> 02:06:14.566
HAVE TO KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE

02:06:14.633 --> 02:06:15.601
A PROBLEM AND I THINK THAT WAS

02:06:15.668 --> 02:06:17.236
CERTAINLY PART OF THE TESTIMONY

02:06:17.303 --> 02:06:18.037
FROM THE PREVIOUS PANELISTS

02:06:18.103 --> 02:06:19.071
THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT.

02:06:19.138 --> 02:06:21.206
PART OF THE POPULATION THAT

02:06:21.273 --> 02:06:24.443
DOESN'T FEEL THAT PUT ALL THE

02:06:24.510 --> 02:06:26.312
MECHANICS AND PLACE THAT WHEN

02:06:26.378 --> 02:06:27.813
THEY DO COME TO THAT REALIZATION

02:06:27.880 --> 02:06:29.882
EITHER THEIR FAMILY OR THEY YOU

02:06:29.949 --> 02:06:31.050
KNOW WE HAVE TWENTY FOUR THEIR

02:06:31.116 --> 02:06:31.984
REQUIRED TO HAVE TWENTY FOUR

02:06:32.051 --> 02:06:33.852
HOUR CALL LINES THEY'RE SUPPOSED

02:06:33.919 --> 02:06:34.119
TO HAVE.

02:06:34.186 --> 02:06:35.187
YOU KNOW ALL YOUKNOW THE

FIVE WITH.

02:07:37.182 --> 02:07:38.450
A PRE IN THE PREVIOUS QUESTION

02:07:38.517 --> 02:07:40.986

PROVIDE --

02:07:45.657 --> 02:07:47.359
MATT I MEAN IS IS THIS.

02:07:47.426 --> 02:07:48.894
THERE'S MORE WE NEED TO DO TO

02:07:48.961 --> 02:07:50.863
TRY TO REASSURE THEM THAT.

YOU AS A PROVIDER THAT THEY

02:07:53.298 --> 02:07:55.634
RECKON FORSMAN AGENCY IS ON

WATER AVENUE AND I'M ON BELL

02:07:56.301 --> 02:07:57.236
STREET.

02:07:58.837 --> 02:08:00.072
THE DOOR AND ASKED ME SOME

02:08:00.139 --> 02:08:00.873
QUESTIONS --

02:08:00.939 --> 02:08:02.474
BECAUSE A NET IN NEXT

02:08:02.541 --> 02:08:03.642
DESIGNATION.

02:08:03.709 --> 02:08:05.277
AS A GREAT PAIN SPECIALS ARE

02:08:05.344 --> 02:08:06.612
PREDOMINATELY PRESCRIBE.

02:08:06.678 --> 02:08:08.313
OPIATES FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT AND

02:08:08.380 --> 02:08:09.715
SO MY USE OF BUPRENORPHINE

02:08:09.782 --> 02:08:10.916
PREDOMINATELY IS FOR PAIN

02:08:10.983 --> 02:08:12.451
MEDICINE NOT SO MUCH FOR

02:08:12.518 --> 02:08:13.719
ADDICTION TREATMENT.

02:08:13.786 --> 02:08:15.454
ALTHOUGH A I AM INVOLVED WITH

02:08:15.521 --> 02:08:17.256
ADDICTION TREATMENT IN A VARIETY

02:08:17.322 --> 02:08:19.091
OF OTHER VENUES --

02:08:19.158 --> 02:08:24.296
THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY THE SAME

02:08:24.363 --> 02:08:25.664
DISEASE.

02:08:25.731 --> 02:08:28.333
BUT IN IN MINE --

02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:30.335
PRACTICE OF PAIN MEDICINE --

02:08:30.402 --> 02:08:33.272
THROUGH A VARIETY OF THINGS YOU

02:08:33.338 --> 02:08:35.774
SEE GUIDELINES OF WRITING THINGS --

02:08:35.841 --> 02:08:37.042
THERE'S BEEN A MOVEMENT TO

02:08:37.109 --> 02:08:39.311
REDUCE MORPHINE EQUIVALENT OF CG

02:08:39.378 --> 02:08:40.879
AND CO PRESCRIBE MEDICATIONS IS

02:08:40.946 --> 02:08:44.817
SO THE THE SUBSTITUTE DRUG DO

02:08:44.883 --> 02:08:45.050
JURY IS.

02:08:45.117 --> 02:08:46.018
AN ORPHAN.

02:08:46.085 --> 02:08:46.852
AND THE BARRIER TO ACCESS TO

02:08:46.919 --> 02:08:49.021
THAT IS THE COST --

02:08:49.088 --> 02:08:51.256
AND ACCESSIBILITY --

02:08:51.323 --> 02:08:52.825
AND THE OTHER THING IS TO BE

02:08:52.891 --> 02:08:53.358
OPEN OR FOR MY CALL THE

02:08:53.425 --> 02:08:55.561
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ARE ARE ON

02:08:55.627 --> 02:08:58.797
THE DATABASE SNEAKERS DATABASES

02:08:58.864 --> 02:09:00.199
HOUSING DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

02:09:00.265 --> 02:09:02.634
AND AS YOU KNOW IS BEING --

02:09:02.701 --> 02:09:04.169
MIND BY --

02:09:04.236 --> 02:09:05.170
FORSMAN.

02:09:05.237 --> 02:09:07.906
AND THE MEDICAL BOARD OF

02:09:07.973 --> 02:09:09.074
CALIFORNIA THERE'S A CORNERS

02:09:09.141 --> 02:09:11.110
PROJECT IT'S ON GOING TO TO READ

02:09:11.176 --> 02:09:11.710
CORRECTIVE ASSESSMENT OF YOUR

02:09:11.777 --> 02:09:12.644

02:09:12.711 --> 02:09:14.279
SO.

02:09:14.346 --> 02:09:16.014
MOST PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO BE A

02:09:16.081 --> 02:09:18.817
LITTLE ADVERSE TO RISK.

02:09:18.884 --> 02:09:20.519
AND THERE'S CERTAINLY RISK

02:09:20.586 --> 02:09:22.187
INVOLVED WITH PRESCRIBING A

02:09:22.254 --> 02:09:24.156
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE RECALL WAY

02:09:24.223 --> 02:09:25.657
BACK IN THE DAY WHEN.

CALIFORNIA EVEN EVEN HAVE THEM

02:09:34.666 --> 02:09:35.667
LET ALONE USE THEM SO IS A

02:09:35.734 --> 02:09:37.836
CONVENIENT EXCUSE NOT TO

PRESCRIBE AT ALL.

02:09:39.638 --> 02:09:41.440
CHAU.

02:09:41.507 --> 02:09:44.042
IT IS AN ISSUE IN A AND I THINK

02:09:44.109 --> 02:09:45.210
VIRTUES AND MORE IMPORTANTLY A

02:09:45.277 --> 02:09:47.279
NETWORK THAT IS MORE OR LESS IN

02:09:47.346 --> 02:09:49.314

INTO QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS I

02:10:22.214 --> 02:10:22.948
FIND ALL KINDS OF A CALLED

02:10:23.015 --> 02:10:24.183
ALCOHOLISM MORE THAN ANYTHING

02:10:24.249 --> 02:10:25.217

METHAMPHETAMINE.

02:10:31.356 --> 02:10:32.691

TELLS ME THAT THE THE SUBS ABUSE

02:10:39.364 --> 02:10:40.933
COMMUNITY IS MUCH BROADER THAN

02:10:40.999 --> 02:10:42.968
WHAT WE'RE ADDRESSING AND THAT'S

02:10:43.035 --> 02:10:44.136
GOING TO REQUIRE MORE OF THIS.

02:10:44.203 --> 02:10:45.337
TO TO WAKE UP TO THAT REALITY

02:10:45.404 --> 02:10:47.072
INCORPORATE THAT INTO OUR

02:10:47.139 --> 02:10:48.640
PRACTICES.

CAPABLE OF DOING SO REDUCE THE

02:11:03.789 --> 02:11:05.324
STIGMA AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ONCE

WE ESTABLISH THAT THIS IS A

02:11:07.326 --> 02:11:08.293
DISEASE.

AN H. B. MANAGERS SUCH A

02:11:09.661 --> 02:11:11.863

02:13:43.348 --> 02:13:45.350
AT LEAST FROM.

02:13:45.417 --> 02:13:46.418
NOW THIS IS THE NOW --

02:13:46.485 --> 02:13:47.519
ABOUT --

02:13:47.586 --> 02:13:49.855
SOME ISSUES ABOUT.

WELL YOU KNOW YOU THROUGH

02:13:51.056 --> 02:13:52.991
CERTIFICATION FOR DIFFERENT

02:13:53.058 --> 02:13:54.893
COUNTIES AND SO TYPICALLY VOEPEL

02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:56.862
IS A REALLY BIG COUNTY.

02:13:56.928 --> 02:13:58.163
THE PRIDE JUST THAT CLUB THAT

02:13:58.230 --> 02:13:58.997
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE ON THE ROAD

02:13:59.064 --> 02:13:59.831
WE PROBABLY HAVE A NETWORK FOR

02:13:59.898 --> 02:14:01.233
YOU INVOLVE MULTIPLE COUNTIES

02:14:01.299 --> 02:14:04.035
RATE AND SO FORTH AND SO AWARE

02:14:04.102 --> 02:14:05.504
TO THINGS THAT.

02:14:05.570 --> 02:14:06.938
COUNTIES ARE LOOKING AT IN TERMS

02:14:07.005 --> 02:14:08.540
OF TRYING TO WELL WE HEARD

02:14:08.607 --> 02:14:09.941
STANDARDIZED MEDICAL NECESSITY

02:14:10.008 --> 02:14:11.376
ACROSS COUNTIES AND THAT MAY BE

02:14:11.443 --> 02:14:12.644
A QUESTION FOR DOCTOR CAN ALSO

02:14:12.711 --> 02:14:16.448
AS WELL --

02:14:16.515 --> 02:14:18.283
TRYING.

02:14:18.350 --> 02:14:18.717
TO THE STANDARDIZED

02:14:18.784 --> 02:14:19.351
CERTIFICATION SO THAT YOU CAN

02:14:19.418 --> 02:14:19.885
ACTUALLY OPERATE MULTIPLE

02:14:19.951 --> 02:14:21.520
COUNTIES IS THAT HAVING.

02:14:21.586 --> 02:14:24.256
TO RECERTIFY OVER AND OVER AGAIN

02:14:24.322 --> 02:14:26.158
FOR DIFFERENT COUNTIES --

02:14:26.224 --> 02:14:28.326
AND ALSO WHAT HOW DO WE MOVE SO

02:14:28.393 --> 02:14:29.961
DO YOU HAVE THAT PIECE OF IT AND

02:14:30.028 --> 02:14:31.196
THEN ALSO WE WE HEARD RIVERSIDE

02:14:31.263 --> 02:14:32.764
SO WE ARE THE AVERAGE OF 7%

02:14:32.831 --> 02:14:34.166
ACCORDING TO EVALUATORS

02:14:34.232 --> 02:14:36.067
RIVERSIDE CLAIMED 80% INCREASE I

02:14:36.134 --> 02:14:38.470
DON'T KNOW LA WAS BUT HOW WE GET

02:14:38.537 --> 02:14:40.739
EVERYONE UP TO THAT.

02:14:40.806 --> 02:14:42.707
EIGHTY FOR THIS IS THE 7% THAT

02:14:42.774 --> 02:14:44.109
WE HAVE STATEWIDE AND WHAT CAN

02:14:44.176 --> 02:14:44.743
WE DO.

02:14:44.810 --> 02:14:46.778
TO TAKE WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND LA

02:14:46.845 --> 02:14:47.879
LAW DOING RIVERSIDE AND GET

02:14:47.946 --> 02:14:49.347
OTHER COUNTIES TO DO THE SAME

02:14:49.414 --> 02:14:52.317
THING SO THERE'S A LOT.

02:14:52.384 --> 02:14:52.918
OF SEVERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

02:14:52.984 --> 02:14:53.618
OTHER -- SO

02:14:53.685 --> 02:14:54.853
I'LL SPEAK TO THEM IN ORDER I

02:14:54.920 --> 02:14:56.521
THINK WITH REGARD TO MEDICAL

02:14:56.588 --> 02:14:58.457
NECESSITY ODS REALLY DOES

02:14:58.523 --> 02:15:00.258
PROVIDE A SOLUTION TO THAT BY

02:15:00.325 --> 02:15:00.892
REQUIRING.

02:15:00.959 --> 02:15:02.093
THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF

02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:03.662
ADDICTION MEDICINE CRITERIA TO

02:15:03.728 --> 02:15:04.563
BE INCORPORATED IN THE

02:15:04.629 --> 02:15:06.832
ASSESSMENT SO THAT IS ONE ROUTE

02:15:06.898 --> 02:15:07.699
TO TAKE --

02:15:07.766 --> 02:15:09.267
AND I THINK ONE WAY FOR COUNTIES

02:15:09.334 --> 02:15:10.435
TO REALLY STANDARDIZE THE WAY

02:15:10.502 --> 02:15:11.703
THAT THEY'RE APPROACHING A

02:15:11.770 --> 02:15:13.205
PLACEMENT ACROSS THE CONTINUUM

02:15:13.271 --> 02:15:15.040
OF CARE IN A SPECIFIC LEVEL OF

02:15:15.106 --> 02:15:16.007
CARE WITH REGARD TO

02:15:16.074 --> 02:15:18.276
CERTIFICATION. FOR FACILITIES

02:15:18.343 --> 02:15:19.478
THAT ALSO WAS HANDLED AT THE

02:15:19.544 --> 02:15:21.213
STATE LEVEL THROUGH PROVIDER

02:15:21.279 --> 02:15:22.914
ENROLLMENT AT DH CS.

02:15:22.981 --> 02:15:24.449
THOUGH I THINK MISTER SIN ELLA

02:15:24.516 --> 02:15:25.350
ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT HE'S

02:15:25.417 --> 02:15:26.885
TALKING ABOUT IS THAT.

02:15:26.952 --> 02:15:29.588
WHEN WHEN OUR CONTRACT?

02:15:29.654 --> 02:15:31.723
THE PROGRAM AUDITOR'S FROM FROM

02:15:31.790 --> 02:15:33.692
THE COUNTY GO IN AND LOOK AT ALL

02:15:33.758 --> 02:15:35.227
OF THE DIFFERENT STAFF IN THOSE

02:15:35.293 --> 02:15:36.294
FACILITIES WE MAKE SURE THAT

02:15:36.361 --> 02:15:37.863
THEY'VE RECEIVED TRAINING ON THE

02:15:37.929 --> 02:15:38.997
SAME CRITERIA.

02:15:39.064 --> 02:15:39.998
THEY RECEIVED ALL OF THE

02:15:40.065 --> 02:15:41.166
DIFFERENT REQUIRED --

02:15:41.233 --> 02:15:43.001
EDUCATIONAL MODULES THAT THAT WE

02:15:43.068 --> 02:15:44.903
WOULD REQUIRE IN THE STATE WOULD

02:15:44.970 --> 02:15:45.937
REQUIRE UNDER CONTRACT.

02:15:46.004 --> 02:15:48.139
SO THAT'S I THINK THAT'S MORE

02:15:48.206 --> 02:15:50.242
WHAT -- WHAT

02:15:50.308 --> 02:15:52.444
HE SPEAKING TO WITH REGARD

02:15:52.511 --> 02:15:53.945
RIDLEY I THINK THERE COULD

02:15:54.012 --> 02:15:55.914
EVENTUALLY BE THE POSSIBILITY OF

02:15:55.981 --> 02:15:57.549
HAVING A MORE STANDARDIZED

02:15:57.616 --> 02:15:59.050
REPOSITORY FOR THAT INFORMATION

02:15:59.117 --> 02:16:01.052
BUT IT WOULD REQUIRE INVESTMENT?

02:16:01.119 --> 02:16:02.020
SO THAT WOULD THAT WOULD REQUIRE

02:16:02.087 --> 02:16:03.488
SOME INFORMATION SYSTEMS BUT

02:16:03.555 --> 02:16:05.557
IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S IT'S IN

02:16:05.624 --> 02:16:06.358
THE ART OF THE POSSIBLE I WOULD

02:16:06.424 --> 02:16:07.692
SAY -- IN

02:16:07.759 --> 02:16:09.227
ADDITION IT WITH REGARD TO THE

02:16:09.294 --> 02:16:11.329
INCREASE IN AND UTILIZATION WHAT

02:16:11.396 --> 02:16:12.931
WE SAW IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WAS

02:16:12.998 --> 02:16:14.232
SOMEWHAT SIMILAR.

02:16:14.299 --> 02:16:16.668
WE SAW A 60% INCREASE ROUGHLY

02:16:16.735 --> 02:16:18.203
AND RESIDENTIAL ADMISSIONS WHICH

02:16:18.270 --> 02:16:19.771
WAS HUGE ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT

02:16:19.838 --> 02:16:21.172
WE HAD BEFORE.

02:16:21.239 --> 02:16:22.607
AND TO PUT A LITTLE MORE CONTEXT

02:16:22.674 --> 02:16:23.875
ON TOP OF WHAT DIRECTOR KENNETH

02:16:23.942 --> 02:16:25.477
SAID.

02:16:25.544 --> 02:16:26.878
BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL MATCHING

02:16:26.945 --> 02:16:28.880
DOLLARS AVAILABLE THROUGH MEDI

02:16:28.947 --> 02:16:30.382
CAL WHEN A LOT OF OUR TREATMENT

02:16:30.448 --> 02:16:31.583
WAS FUNDED THROUGH OTHER SOURCES

02:16:31.650 --> 02:16:33.485
LIKE AB ONE OH NINE PREVIOUSLY

02:16:33.552 --> 02:16:35.120
THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM ETCETERA.

02:16:35.186 --> 02:16:36.655
THOSE WERE STRICTLY CAP DOLLARS

02:16:36.721 --> 02:16:38.690
SO NOW THAT W HAVE A VARIETY OF

02:16:38.757 --> 02:16:39.758
DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES

02:16:39.824 --> 02:16:40.859
INCLUDING REALIGNMENT WE CAN

02:16:40.926 --> 02:16:43.128
APPLY TO THE MEDICARE PROGRAM.

02:16:43.194 --> 02:16:45.530
IT OPENS UP MANY MANY MORE BEDS --

02:16:45.597 --> 02:16:47.032
IN OUR CONTRACTED FACILITIES SO

02:16:47.098 --> 02:16:48.199
AS LONG AS WE HAVE THOSE

02:16:48.266 --> 02:16:50.135
PROVIDERS UNDER CONTRACT WE CAN

02:16:50.201 --> 02:16:51.169
BUY EVERY SINGLE BUT IN THAT

02:16:51.236 --> 02:16:52.504
FACILITY IF WE HAVE THE

02:16:52.571 --> 02:16:54.005
RESOURCES OR NOT STRICTLY.

02:16:54.072 --> 02:16:55.674
CAPPED ANYMORE --

02:16:55.740 --> 02:16:57.442
AS WE WERE PREVIOUSLY WITH

02:16:57.509 --> 02:16:59.110
FEDERAL BLOCK GRANT DOLLARS OR

02:16:59.177 --> 02:17:00.478
AB ONE OH NINE DOLLAR.

02:17:00.545 --> 02:17:02.447
SO THAT THAT I THINK THAT COVERS

02:17:02.514 --> 02:17:04.516
MANY OF DID THE ISSUES YOU

02:17:04.583 --> 02:17:06.484
RAISED THAT I MISS ANYTHING.

02:17:06.551 --> 02:17:07.419
BUT I IT'S GREAT TO HEAR LA

02:17:07.485 --> 02:17:09.054
COUNTY SIXTY FOR SAID I HERE

02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:11.022
WHICH IS THE BIGGEST COUNTY IN

02:17:11.089 --> 02:17:11.823
OUR STATE --

02:17:11.890 --> 02:17:15.627
HERE NEVER SIDE --

02:17:15.694 --> 02:17:17.762
PERCENT SO WHERE WAS THE OVERALL

02:17:17.829 --> 02:17:20.999
STATE ONLY 7% HEARD SOME OF THE

02:17:21.066 --> 02:17:21.833
FOR THE EASTER COUNTIES OF US BE

02:17:21.900 --> 02:17:25.670
LAGGING BEHIND AND SAID WE HAVE

02:17:25.737 --> 02:17:25.870
THESE.

02:17:25.937 --> 02:17:28.373
LEAD AND WE WE PLAY OUT THE 3%

02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:30.008
THAT WERE COVERED BY ODS BUT WAS

02:17:30.075 --> 02:17:32.043
A 97% OF POPULATION --

02:17:32.110 --> 02:17:34.012
SAID BUT SO WHAT WHERE WE GO IT

02:17:34.079 --> 02:17:35.447
IS SO WHAT ARE SOME THE THINGS

02:17:35.513 --> 02:17:37.282
THAT WE CAN DO TO WHAT ABOUT THE

02:17:37.349 --> 02:17:38.783
OTHER COUNTIES RIGHT --

02:17:38.850 --> 02:17:40.051
YOU KNOW EIGHTY TWO SIXTY THE

02:17:40.118 --> 02:17:42.153
HOUSE 7% AVERAGE LIKE WHAT

02:17:42.220 --> 02:17:44.589
WHAT'S HOLDING THE OTHER SOME OF

02:17:44.656 --> 02:17:45.490
THE OTHER COUNTIES BACK.

02:17:45.557 --> 02:17:46.591
I THINK I WOULD IDENTIFY THREE

02:17:46.658 --> 02:17:47.959
THINGS PRINCIPALLY NUMBER ONE IS

02:17:48.026 --> 02:17:50.528
PROBABLY. FOR A LOT OF ROLLER

02:17:50.595 --> 02:17:52.297
SMALLER COUNTIES WITH PERHAPS

02:17:52.364 --> 02:17:53.965
LESS INFRASTRUCTURE IT'S REALLY

02:17:54.032 --> 02:17:55.600
A LIMIT IN TERMS OF WHAT

02:17:55.667 --> 02:17:56.901
FACILITIES THEY HAVE.

02:17:56.968 --> 02:17:58.036
SO THAT'S THAT'S PROBABLY THE

02:17:58.103 --> 02:17:59.404
FIRST LIMITATION THE SECOND

02:17:59.471 --> 02:18:01.506
REALLY IS WORKFORCE EDUCATION

02:18:01.573 --> 02:18:02.841
AND TRAINING SO THERE'S BEEN

02:18:02.907 --> 02:18:04.242
INVESTMENT IN THE PAST IN THE

02:18:04.309 --> 02:18:05.043
MENTAL HEALTH SPACE AND THAT

02:18:05.110 --> 02:18:06.611
MADE IN THAT REGARD.

02:18:06.678 --> 02:18:08.346
I THINK THAT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY

02:18:08.413 --> 02:18:09.414
VALUABLE --

02:18:09.481 --> 02:18:10.582
IN THE SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT

02:18:10.649 --> 02:18:12.517
FIELD AS WELL WE JUST WE WE ARE

02:18:12.584 --> 02:18:14.019
SORELY LACKING THE WORK FORCE TO

02:18:14.085 --> 02:18:14.919
SERVE.

02:18:14.986 --> 02:18:16.321
ALL OF THE NEED DID LA IN

02:18:16.388 --> 02:18:18.423
RIVERSIDE HIGHER EVERYONE ELSE

02:18:18.490 --> 02:18:19.324
PEOPLE.

02:18:19.391 --> 02:18:20.959
I DON'T I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE

02:18:21.026 --> 02:18:22.794
WE STILL NEED MORE.

02:18:22.861 --> 02:18:24.396
WELL I HAVE A I GUESS THERE IS A

02:18:24.462 --> 02:18:25.063
BAND THAT AND AGREED.

02:18:25.130 --> 02:18:26.197
I'M NOT DISAGREE WITH THE

02:18:26.264 --> 02:18:27.532
STATEMENT THAT WE NEED TO DO

02:18:27.599 --> 02:18:29.034
WORK WORK FORCE RIGHT WITH THE

02:18:29.100 --> 02:18:30.502
WORKFORCE IS INSUFFICIENT BUT

02:18:30.568 --> 02:18:32.370
ALSO.

02:18:32.437 --> 02:18:36.675
I WOULD ALSO RECOGNIZE AND THAT.

02:18:36.741 --> 02:18:37.909
RIVERSIDE DR 80% YOU JUST TALK

02:18:37.976 --> 02:18:40.011
60% WITH YOUR EXIST I SOON WITH

02:18:40.078 --> 02:18:40.845
YOUR EXISTING WORK FORCE THE

02:18:40.912 --> 02:18:42.414
BEADED SUCK UP ALL THE WORK

02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:43.014
FORCE BUT ALL THE OTHER PEOLE

02:18:43.081 --> 02:18:43.548
THEY ALL MOVED TO THIS TO

02:18:43.615 --> 02:18:44.916
COUNTIES AND THAT'S WHY THE

02:18:44.983 --> 02:18:46.117
OTHER COUNTIES COULD DO IT RIGHT

02:18:46.184 --> 02:18:46.418
I'M SORRY.

02:18:46.484 --> 02:18:47.218
I IS I'M NOT SAYING THAT

02:18:47.285 --> 02:18:48.620
WORKFORCE IS AN ISSUE BUT I'M

02:18:48.687 --> 02:18:50.121
ALSO SAYING THAT WELL YOU SAID

02:18:50.188 --> 02:18:52.323
YOU GOT 60% INCREASE IN LA LA

02:18:52.390 --> 02:18:53.491
YOU KNOW AT SO.

02:18:53.558 --> 02:18:56.327
WHAT ELSE IS HOLDING PEOPLE BACK

02:18:56.394 --> 02:18:59.464
SO LOOK AT THAT AND SEE WHAT WE

02:18:59.531 --> 02:19:00.598
CAN TRY TO DO?

02:19:00.665 --> 02:19:02.033
BUT WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING AS

02:19:02.100 --> 02:19:04.069
WELL BECAUSE AT LEAST THAT

02:19:04.135 --> 02:19:05.103
WASN'T THERE WITH THE STATE THAT

02:19:05.170 --> 02:19:06.538
MADE THAT IF MAYBE RATE LIVING

02:19:06.604 --> 02:19:09.407
STAT BUT IT DIDN'T HOLD YOU BACK

02:19:09.474 --> 02:19:10.308
FROM DOING 60% LA COUNTY.

02:19:10.375 --> 02:19:12.143
SO YEAH I THINK THE OTHER PIECE

02:19:12.210 --> 02:19:13.311
THE THAT ALSO ARE COLLEAGUES

02:19:13.378 --> 02:19:15.113
FROM DH CS SPOKE TO HAS TO DO

02:19:15.180 --> 02:19:15.980
WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE

02:19:16.047 --> 02:19:17.582
CAPABILITY OF INDIVIDUAL

02:19:17.649 --> 02:19:18.950
COUNTIES SO WE ARE.

02:19:19.017 --> 02:19:20.819
A LARGE COUNTY WE HAVE HUNDREDS

02:19:20.885 --> 02:19:22.353
OF EMPLOYEES WITHIN OUR DIVISION

02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:23.655
WE HAVE BROUGHT ON A LOT OF

02:19:23.722 --> 02:19:25.457
STAFF TO HANDLE AUTHORIZATIONS

02:19:25.523 --> 02:19:26.624
AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT

02:19:26.691 --> 02:19:28.526
UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT --

02:19:28.593 --> 02:19:29.861
MANY OF THEM ARE CLINICIANS

02:19:29.928 --> 02:19:31.629
LICENSED PROFESSIONALS SOCIAL

02:19:31.696 --> 02:19:33.531
WORKERS PHYSICIANS NURSES WHO

02:19:33.598 --> 02:19:35.433
HANDLE THAT WORK WE'VE GOT A A

02:19:35.500 --> 02:19:36.735
STRATEGIC PLANNING STAFF A

02:19:36.801 --> 02:19:37.902
MARKETING AND BENEFITS YOUR

02:19:37.969 --> 02:19:39.137
ENGAGEMENT STAFF.

02:19:39.204 --> 02:19:40.438
WHICH ARE.

02:19:40.505 --> 02:19:41.740
YOU KNOW THE WHICH ARE FUNCTIONS

02:19:41.806 --> 02:19:43.007
THAT I DON'T EXIST I DON'T THINK

02:19:43.074 --> 02:19:44.409
EXIST IN A LOT OF OTHER COUNTY

02:19:44.476 --> 02:19:45.910
SO PART OF IT REALLY IS I THINK

02:19:45.977 --> 02:19:47.178
THE ABILITY OF THE COUNTY TO

02:19:47.245 --> 02:19:48.313
SHOULDER --

02:19:48.379 --> 02:19:49.781
AND TO TAKE ON A LOT OF THE

02:19:49.848 --> 02:19:51.850
REQUIREMENTS OF OF THE WAIVER I

02:19:51.916 --> 02:19:52.984
I WOULD SAY MANY OF MY

02:19:53.051 --> 02:19:55.253
COLLEAGUES WOULD WOULD RAISE

02:19:55.320 --> 02:19:59.257
THAT IS AN IMMEDIATE LIMITATION --

02:19:59.324 --> 02:19:59.858
THANKS THE CROWD THANK YOU YOU

02:19:59.924 --> 02:20:01.493
KNOW.

02:20:01.559 --> 02:20:03.928
MODOC COUNTY IS ONE OF THE

02:20:03.995 --> 02:20:05.997
HIGHEST RATES IN THE STATE.

02:20:06.064 --> 02:20:07.165
THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN GET FROM

02:20:07.232 --> 02:20:08.800
ALL TERRORIST READING WHICH IS A

02:20:08.867 --> 02:20:10.402
HUB CLOSE AS YOU CAN GET TO IS

02:20:10.468 --> 02:20:11.569
SUSANVILLE.

02:20:11.636 --> 02:20:13.104
IN MOST PEOPLE IN MODOC COUNTY

02:20:13.171 --> 02:20:15.340
GET THEIR HEALTH CARE EITHER IN

02:20:15.406 --> 02:20:17.175
OREGON OR IN IN RENO.

02:20:17.242 --> 02:20:19.477
SO. ONE OF THE ONE OF THE THINGS

02:20:19.544 --> 02:20:21.079
THAT WE NEED TO DO IS LEVERAGE

02:20:21.146 --> 02:20:22.514
AND EXTEND THE REACH OF THE

02:20:22.580 --> 02:20:24.449
PROVIDERS DEBTS TELEHEALTH IN A

02:20:24.516 --> 02:20:25.917
DROP OF ELECTRONIC MEDICAL

02:20:25.984 --> 02:20:28.419
RECORDS TO TO WHICH WE DON'T

02:20:28.486 --> 02:20:29.621
HAVE AN ABUNDANCE.

02:20:29.687 --> 02:20:30.822
YOU KNOW I I'VE WORKED FOR YEARS

02:20:30.889 --> 02:20:31.856
TO TRY TO BUILD TO DO THAT

02:20:31.923 --> 02:20:32.791
THERE'S A VARIETY OF

02:20:32.857 --> 02:20:34.359
ENCUMBRANCES WITH HIP AND THAT

02:20:34.425 --> 02:20:35.493
pSORT OF THING.

02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:37.295
BUT WE COULD EXTEND THE REACH OF

02:20:37.362 --> 02:20:40.965
THE EXISTING PROVIDERS NOW IF WE

02:20:41.032 --> 02:20:41.466
COULD JUST ADDRESS THOSE

02:20:41.533 --> 02:20:43.034
SITUATIONS.

02:20:43.101 --> 02:20:44.002
BUT I THINK CERTAINLY WILL --

02:20:44.068 --> 02:20:45.403
YOU KNOW WE NEED MORE PEOPLE BUT

02:20:45.470 --> 02:20:48.206
I ALSO WANT THAT WE WON'T PEOPLE

02:20:48.273 --> 02:20:49.707
LOOK AT WORKFORCE ISSUES --

02:20:49.774 --> 02:20:51.810
AND THIS IS BEYOND JUST

02:20:51.876 --> 02:20:53.678
SUBSTANCE USE BUT YOU KNOW WE WE

02:20:53.745 --> 02:20:55.180
FOR A BURDEN MANY PROVIDERS WITH

02:20:55.246 --> 02:20:57.115
ADMINISTRATIVE WORK SO FOR

02:20:57.182 --> 02:20:58.283
EXAMPLE AND THIS IS NOT THE TWO

02:20:58.349 --> 02:20:59.751
SUBS USE BUT THE RESEARCH STUDY

02:20:59.818 --> 02:21:00.718
DONE.

02:21:00.785 --> 02:21:02.120
PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS ONLY

02:21:02.187 --> 02:21:05.356
SPENDING 26% OF TIME DOING

02:21:05.423 --> 02:21:06.324
CLINICAL WORK.

02:21:06.391 --> 02:21:07.525
IF YOU WANT W. WORKFORCE CUT THE

02:21:07.592 --> 02:21:10.261
ADMINISTRATIVE WORK DOWN THE 50%.

02:21:10.328 --> 02:21:12.497
YOU CAN STILL SPEND 50% AND YOU

02:21:12.564 --> 02:21:14.232
BASICALLY AND LET DO 50%

02:21:14.299 --> 02:21:15.733
CLINICAL ARCHITECT TO DOUBLE

02:21:15.800 --> 02:21:17.168
YOUR PRIMARY CARE WORK FORCE.

02:21:17.235 --> 02:21:18.002
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS IN

02:21:18.069 --> 02:21:20.305
THE SUBSTANCE USE AREA BUT YOU

02:21:20.371 --> 02:21:23.241
KNOW THAT'S THERE'S A COST TO

02:21:23.308 --> 02:21:24.642
THE WORK FORCE WHEN PEOPLE ARE

02:21:24.709 --> 02:21:25.810
OVER BURDENED WITH.

02:21:25.877 --> 02:21:26.211
WITH -- WITH

02:21:26.277 --> 02:21:29.314
OVER A BASICALLY OF WORK AND I

02:21:29.380 --> 02:21:31.115
REALIZE THAT YOU KNOW CMS

02:21:31.182 --> 02:21:32.183
KANAREK CHOIR CERTAINLY OF

02:21:32.250 --> 02:21:33.618
DOCUMENTATION WE HAVE TO SET HER

02:21:33.685 --> 02:21:34.986
UP BUT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT.

02:21:35.053 --> 02:21:35.920
WHAT THE BALANCE AND HAVE THAT

02:21:35.987 --> 02:21:37.622
KIND OF CONVERSATION NOW IN THE

02:21:37.689 --> 02:21:39.858
STATE BUT NATIONALLY AS WELL --

02:21:39.924 --> 02:21:42.260
BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE

02:21:42.327 --> 02:21:43.661
THEN IS IS THAT --

02:21:43.728 --> 02:21:45.864
IN TERMS OF THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH

02:21:45.930 --> 02:21:47.198
DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION.

02:21:47.265 --> 02:21:47.966
I MEA.

02:21:48.032 --> 02:21:49.200
I KNOW THAT EACH COUNTY HAS

02:21:49.267 --> 02:21:50.702
CERTAINLY HAS THE AS PRIDE IN

02:21:50.768 --> 02:21:52.704
ITSELF AND EVERYONE WANTS TO DO

02:21:52.770 --> 02:21:53.805
THEIR OWN THING AND WE HAVE

02:21:53.872 --> 02:21:54.973
SMALL COUNTY IS A LARGE ACCOUNT

02:21:55.039 --> 02:21:56.107
USING YOUR RIGHT YOU KNOW FIGURE

02:21:56.174 --> 02:21:57.742
COUNTIES LIKE LA.

02:21:57.809 --> 02:21:59.377
HAVE MORE SUPPORT HELP OTHER

02:21:59.444 --> 02:22:01.112
SUPPORT FOLKS YOU CAN DO IF

02:22:01.179 --> 02:22:02.814
MARKETS ADDRESS BUT I MEAN IS IS

02:22:02.881 --> 02:22:04.515
THERE SOME EFFORT TO THINK ABOUT

02:22:04.582 --> 02:22:06.184
WELL HOW CAN.

02:22:06.251 --> 02:22:08.052
WE E. REGION LIES ARE BUYING THE

02:22:08.119 --> 02:22:09.487
THE TO COLLABORATE MULTIPLE

02:22:09.554 --> 02:22:11.356
COUNTIES COMING TOGETHER TO DO

02:22:11.422 --> 02:22:13.758
SOME OF THESE FUNCTIONS --

02:22:13.825 --> 02:22:16.094
IS THERE SOME MECHANISM TO TO DO

02:22:16.160 --> 02:22:17.328
THAT I REALIZE EVERY COUNTY HAS

02:22:17.395 --> 02:22:18.863
THEIR OWN BUDGET THEY GET THEIR

02:22:18.930 --> 02:22:20.331
OWN I MEAN I'VE HEARD BUT

02:22:20.398 --> 02:22:21.466
SUBCOMMITTEE TO GET DOWN A

02:22:21.532 --> 02:22:21.699
LITTLE.

02:22:21.766 --> 02:22:22.300
BUT YEAH THERE TO DEFUSE THE

02:22:22.367 --> 02:22:24.335
FUNDING STREAM BUT AT SOME POINT

02:22:24.402 --> 02:22:24.802
TO BUILD THAT KIND OF

02:22:24.869 --> 02:22:26.204
INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:22:26.271 --> 02:22:27.338
RIGHT -- IT

02:22:27.405 --> 02:22:28.640
IN SUCH A SMALL ONES MAYBE THAN

02:22:28.706 --> 02:22:29.941
EVEN THE MEDIUM ONES ARE MEETING

02:22:30.008 --> 02:22:31.342
WAS CAN HELP SMALL ONES THAT WE

WHAT ABOUT A HUB AND SPOKE FOR

02:22:38.316 --> 02:22:40.652
COUNTIES RIGHT WHAT ABOUT

02:22:40.718 --> 02:22:42.553
PROBABLY AS WELL AS TERMS OF OUT

02:22:42.620 --> 02:22:43.888
REACH NOT COUNTY SPECIFIC WHEN

02:22:43.955 --> 02:22:44.322
MARK?

02:22:44.389 --> 02:22:45.857
BUT I'M JUST THINKING LIKE IS

02:22:45.924 --> 02:22:47.992
BECAUSE WE AGES SERVE HERE THIS

02:22:48.059 --> 02:22:49.494
I GO OKAY WELL.

02:22:49.560 --> 02:22:50.395
YOU KNOW BUT IT'S GOOD I

02:22:50.461 --> 02:22:51.763
APPRECIATE HAVING LA HERE APRIL

02:22:51.829 --> 02:22:53.631
RIVERSIDE HIGH PERFORMING ONCE

02:22:53.698 --> 02:22:54.699
WEBER THE LOW PERFORMING ONE

02:22:54.766 --> 02:22:56.034
SAKE TELL ME WHAT THE PRICE YEAH

02:22:56.100 --> 02:22:57.168
WHAT'S WHAT'S KEEPING YOU FROM

02:22:57.235 --> 02:22:59.003
BEING AN LA RIVER SIDE RIGHT AND

02:22:59.070 --> 02:23:00.171
WHAT DO WE NEED TO GET.

02:23:00.238 --> 02:23:01.639
TO WHERE TYPES OF THINGS THAT WE

02:23:01.706 --> 02:23:03.641
CAN LEVERAGE TO TRY TO GET YOUR

02:23:03.708 --> 02:23:07.645
PERFORMANCE UP TO THAT --

02:23:07.712 --> 02:23:08.780
THAT LEVEL YEAH I THINK YOUR

02:23:08.846 --> 02:23:09.981
YOUR COMMENTS A LINE VERY

02:23:10.048 --> 02:23:11.416
CLOSELY WITH THE FEELINGS OF THE

02:23:11.482 --> 02:23:12.984
ASSOCIATION AND IT REGIONAL

02:23:13.051 --> 02:23:14.886
APPROACHES I THINK FOR MANY WILL

02:23:14.953 --> 02:23:16.020
BE A WAY TO PULL RSOURCES

02:23:16.087 --> 02:23:17.488
PARTICULARLY IN AREAS WHERE THEY

02:23:17.555 --> 02:23:18.456
HAVE MORE ADMINISTRATIVE

02:23:18.523 --> 02:23:19.324
CHALLENGES SO THAT.

02:23:19.390 --> 02:23:20.959
THAT ABSOLUTELY A LINES I THINK

02:23:21.025 --> 02:23:23.027
WITH THE GOALS OF OF THE THE

02:23:23.094 --> 02:23:23.594
ASSOCIATION AND THE VARIOUS

02:23:23.661 --> 02:23:25.229
COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

02:23:25.296 --> 02:23:27.432
DIRECTORS WE WE UNDERSTAND THAT

02:23:27.498 --> 02:23:28.399
OBVIOUSLY NEEDS AN

02:23:28.466 --> 02:23:29.667
INFRASTRUCTURE VERY DIFFERENT

02:23:29.734 --> 02:23:31.202
CROSS THE STATE AND SO.

02:23:31.269 --> 02:23:32.103
I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN A

02:23:32.170 --> 02:23:33.338
FRAMEWORK THAT LOOKS AT IN

02:23:33.404 --> 02:23:34.572
CERTAIN AREAS WERE THAT MAKES A

02:23:34.639 --> 02:23:36.107
LOT OF SENSE PERHAPS EVEN AMONG

02:23:36.174 --> 02:23:37.308
MEDIUM SIZE COUNTIES THAT THAT

02:23:37.375 --> 02:23:38.476
WOULD BE AN OPTION THAT THEY

02:23:38.543 --> 02:23:39.377
COULD PURSUE TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:23:39.444 --> 02:23:39.877
WERE.

02:23:39.944 --> 02:23:41.512
LEVERAGING EVERYBODY'S RESOURCES

02:23:41.579 --> 02:23:43.614
IN A PARTICULAR REGION --

02:23:43.681 --> 02:23:44.582
AND I THINK --

02:23:44.649 --> 02:23:46.084
YOU KNOW THE THE RELATIONSHIP OF

02:23:46.150 --> 02:23:47.385
THE COUNTIES TO THE MANAGED CARE

02:23:47.452 --> 02:23:48.753
PLANS IS ANOTHER QUESTION THERE

02:23:48.820 --> 02:23:49.887
THERE IS.

02:23:49.954 --> 02:23:51.456
A PROVISION IN THE DMC ODS

02:23:51.522 --> 02:23:52.991
WAIVER THAT ALLOWS OBVIOUSLY

02:23:53.057 --> 02:23:54.993
COUNTIES AS PARTNERSHIP IS DOING

02:23:55.059 --> 02:23:57.662
WITH NORTHERN RURAL COUNTIES.

02:23:57.729 --> 02:23:58.329
TO TO YOU KNOW ENGAGE IN

02:23:58.396 --> 02:23:59.998
PARTNERSHIPS AND TO WORK WITH

02:24:00.064 --> 02:24:01.332
MANAGED CARE PLANS TO USE THEIR

02:24:01.399 --> 02:24:03.034
INFRASTRUCTURE TO OPERATIONALIZE

02:24:03.101 --> 02:24:04.268
THE BENEFIT AS WELL.

02:24:04.335 --> 02:24:06.304
SO I THINK THE THE WAYS THAT

02:24:06.371 --> 02:24:07.905
COUNTIES MAY APPROACH THEIR

02:24:07.972 --> 02:24:10.575
THEIR MANAGED CARE PLANS TO MAKE --

02:24:10.641 --> 02:24:12.543
BENEFITS MORE ROBUST WILL VARY

02:24:12.610 --> 02:24:13.411
ACROSS THE COUNTIES BUT

02:24:13.478 --> 02:24:15.246
CERTAINLY I THINK THERE ARE LOTS

02:24:15.313 --> 02:24:19.484
OF DIFFERENT IDEAS AND AND

02:24:19.550 --> 02:24:22.553
THERE'S OPENNESS TO ELABORATE

02:24:22.620 --> 02:24:24.956
ACROSS DIFFERENT PARTNERS SO I I

02:24:25.023 --> 02:24:27.458
APPRECIATE WHEN YOU SAY OPENNESS

02:24:27.525 --> 02:24:28.059
AND ONE KNOW WHEN SOMETHING'S

02:24:28.126 --> 02:24:29.027
GOING TO HAPPEN --

02:24:29.093 --> 02:24:30.395

COLDER DISCUSSIONS WITH BOTH

TO KIND OF CRYSTALLIZE OUR

02:27:25.236 --> 02:27:25.870
PROPOSAL TO THE FEDERAL

02:27:25.937 --> 02:27:26.938
GOVERNMENT --

02:27:27.004 --> 02:27:28.139
THERE'S PLACES WHERE WE'RE GONNA

02:27:28.206 --> 02:27:29.440
BE LOOKING FOR INPUT AND WE'RE

02:27:29.507 --> 02:27:30.675

02:27:30.741 --> 02:27:31.976
THINK THAT --

02:27:32.043 --> 02:27:33.678
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HE

02:27:33.744 --> 02:27:35.913
MENTIONED AROUND THE LENGTH OF

02:27:35.980 --> 02:27:37.148
STAY.

02:27:37.215 --> 02:27:37.715
THAT CAPS --

02:27:37.782 --> 02:27:38.649
DAYS -- HAS

02:27:38.716 --> 02:27:40.151
CERTAINLY BEEN SOMETHING THAT

02:27:40.218 --> 02:27:41.285
THEY HAVE HIGHLIGHTED FROM THE

02:27:41.352 --> 02:27:43.087
BEGINNING --

02:27:43.154 --> 02:27:43.754
I WILL SAY THAT THAT WAS A

02:27:43.821 --> 02:27:45.790
FEDERAL ISSUE --

02:27:45.856 --> 02:27:46.757
SO.

02:27:46.824 --> 02:27:48.059
YOU KNOW IT AT A CERTAIN POINT

02:27:48.125 --> 02:27:49.594
AND WE DO HAVE A NEGOTIATING

02:27:49.660 --> 02:27:50.928
PARTNER THAT WE HAVE.

02:27:50.995 --> 02:27:52.230
TO ALSO WORK WITH AT THE FEDERAL

02:27:52.296 --> 02:27:53.464
LEVEL AND SO SOME OF THESE

02:27:53.531 --> 02:27:55.866
THINGS WERE SPECIFIC TO THEM AND

02:27:55.933 --> 02:27:56.701
AND REALLY ADDRESS THEIR

02:27:56.767 --> 02:27:57.935
CONCERNS ABOUT A NEW BENEFIT

02:27:58.002 --> 02:27:58.836
BEING.

02:27:58.903 --> 02:27:59.804
ROLLED OUT IN A WAY THAT THEY

02:27:59.870 --> 02:28:01.072
WANTED TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT WAS

02:28:01.138 --> 02:28:02.406
GOING TO BE UTILIZED.

02:28:02.473 --> 02:28:03.307
I THINK --

02:28:03.374 --> 02:28:06.644
THE WAIVER PRISON --

02:28:06.711 --> 02:28:08.479
COUNTY SIR REGIONAL LIES --

02:28:08.546 --> 02:28:09.981
AND FOR US TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT

02:28:10.047 --> 02:28:11.649
FUNDING AND FINANCING MECHANISMS

02:28:11.716 --> 02:28:12.350
I KNOW THAT --

02:28:12.416 --> 02:28:13.751
CERTAINLY COST BASED

02:28:13.818 --> 02:28:15.620
REIMBURSEMENT HAS BEEN --

02:28:15.686 --> 02:28:17.588
REYES NOT ONLY IN THIS ISSUE BUT

02:28:17.655 --> 02:28:18.789
IN THE MENTAL HEALTH --

02:28:18.856 --> 02:28:20.358
WAIVER IN THE NINETEEN FIFTEEN

02:28:20.424 --> 02:28:21.559
WAIVER AS WELL AND SO I THINK.

02:28:21.626 --> 02:28:23.394
YOU KNOW WE HAVE A WE HAVE OUR

02:28:23.461 --> 02:28:24.662
UNLESS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT

02:28:24.729 --> 02:28:26.464
THAT WILL BE WORKING TO KIND OF

02:28:26.530 --> 02:28:27.298
CRYSTALLIZED AROUND THINKING

02:28:27.365 --> 02:28:29.400
AROUND WHAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE

02:28:29.467 --> 02:28:30.835
TO RECOMMEND --

02:28:30.901 --> 02:28:32.203
AS MAYBE A DRAFT PROPOSAL AND

02:28:32.270 --> 02:28:34.305
THEN HAVE STAKEHOLDERS RESPOND

02:28:34.372 --> 02:28:36.307
TO THAT SO IT IT'LL BE AN

02:28:36.374 --> 02:28:37.308
ITERATIVE PROCESS.

02:28:37.375 --> 02:28:38.976
YOUR GUIDE TO ENGAGE THE

02:28:39.043 --> 02:28:41.512
LEGISLATURE IN THIS COURSE.

02:28:41.579 --> 02:28:43.180
THANK YOU --

02:28:43.247 --> 02:28:44.148
AND BECAUSE THE OTHER QUESTION I

02:28:44.215 --> 02:28:47.752
HAVE IS -- I

02:28:47.818 --> 02:28:49.287
I UNDERSTAND --

02:28:49.353 --> 02:28:51.322
THAT IS VOLUNTARY YOU'VE SORT OF

02:28:51.389 --> 02:28:52.456
TOUCHED ON SOME OF THE REASONS

02:28:52.523 --> 02:28:54.792
WHY --

02:28:54.859 --> 02:28:56.127
CONCERNS ABOUT.

02:28:56.193 --> 02:28:58.462
DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO

02:28:58.529 --> 02:29:00.364
SERVICES BETWEEN.

02:29:00.431 --> 02:29:01.399
RESIDENTS IN THE OPT IN COUNTIES

02:29:01.465 --> 02:29:03.434
VERSUS THE OPT OUT COUNTIES IS

02:29:03.501 --> 02:29:05.836
THAT SOMETHING.

02:29:05.903 --> 02:29:07.872
HOW WE CAN DEAL WITH THAT --

02:29:07.938 --> 02:29:09.373
I MEAN I THINK THAT GOES TO THE

02:29:09.440 --> 02:29:11.042
DISCUSSION THAT --

02:29:11.108 --> 02:29:13.678
WE HAD EARLIER AROUND THE THE

02:29:13.744 --> 02:29:14.879
THE VERY FEW COUNTIES THAT HAVE

02:29:14.945 --> 02:29:16.147
NOT.

02:29:16.213 --> 02:29:17.648
PUT IN IMPLEMENTATION PLANS ARE

02:29:17.715 --> 02:29:20.718
VERY SMALL AND MOSTLY UPPER

02:29:20.785 --> 02:29:21.852
RURAL NORTH --

02:29:21.919 --> 02:29:24.088
I THINK THAT WAS IN SOME CASES

02:29:24.155 --> 02:29:25.623
MY EFFORT TO REACH OUT TO SEE

02:29:25.690 --> 02:29:28.092
MUST BE TO HAVE A DISCUSSION --

02:29:28.159 --> 02:29:28.626
TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT AND

02:29:28.693 --> 02:29:32.797
NARROW THAT --

02:29:32.863 --> 02:29:35.700
BUT WE CANNOT REQUIRE COUNTIES

02:29:35.766 --> 02:29:38.102
TO PARTICIPATE I THINK THAT --

02:29:38.169 --> 02:29:39.904
EVEN IN SPITE OF THAT THE

02:29:39.970 --> 02:29:41.405
COUNTIES WE WOULD WANT TO HELP

02:29:41.472 --> 02:29:42.940
THEM BE SUCCESSFUL IN PROVIDING

02:29:43.007 --> 02:29:44.875
THE REQUIRED MANDATED STATE PLAN

02:29:44.942 --> 02:29:45.810
SERVICES.

02:29:45.876 --> 02:29:47.111
THAT ARE THE LOWER LEVEL OF

02:29:47.178 --> 02:29:48.679
SERVICES THAT HAVE ALWAYS BEEN

02:29:48.746 --> 02:29:50.281
REQUIRED --

02:29:50.348 --> 02:29:52.249
IN TERMS OF METHADONE --

02:29:52.316 --> 02:29:53.684
OUTPATIENT DRUG FREE COUNSELING

02:29:53.751 --> 02:29:55.486
PERINATAL RESIDENTIAL INTENSIVE

02:29:55.553 --> 02:29:58.189
OUTPATIENT THERAPY --

02:29:58.255 --> 02:29:59.423
THOSE ARE ALREADY REQUIRED OF

02:29:59.490 --> 02:30:00.324
THE COUNTIES REGARDLESS OF

02:30:00.391 --> 02:30:01.892
WHETHER THEY ARE.

02:30:01.959 --> 02:30:03.227
IN THE PROCESS OF GOING INTO THE

02:30:03.294 --> 02:30:04.795
WAIVER OR NOT AND SO WE'VE BEEN

02:30:04.862 --> 02:30:06.230
WORKING WITH THE COUNTY STEVEN

02:30:06.297 --> 02:30:07.298
BRING THEM UP TO COMPLIANCE IN

02:30:07.365 --> 02:30:10.835
THOSE AREAS AND AGAIN THAT'S

02:30:10.901 --> 02:30:12.303
THAT'S AN ONGOING EFFORT BY OUR

02:30:12.370 --> 02:30:14.071
DEPARTMENT.

02:30:14.138 --> 02:30:16.040
AND NO QUESTION IS AND MAYBE

02:30:16.107 --> 02:30:18.376
IT'S A QUESTION FOR BOTH --

02:30:18.442 --> 02:30:20.778
NO CHIEF PRESENT ALSO --

02:30:20.845 --> 02:30:22.346
DOCTOR CONNELLY THAT HAPPENS

02:30:22.413 --> 02:30:26.817
FOLK BECAUSE SYSTEM AND CORRECT

02:30:26.884 --> 02:30:27.151
ME OF A ROCK.

02:30:27.218 --> 02:30:27.852
I MEAN.

02:30:27.918 --> 02:30:28.619
SO COUNTIES DON'T GET GRANTS FOR

02:30:28.686 --> 02:30:30.321
THAT RIGHT SO THAT'S KIND OF

02:30:30.388 --> 02:30:31.021
LIKE --

02:30:31.088 --> 02:30:32.790
ANNALS OVERLAYS RIGHT WORDS SO

02:30:32.857 --> 02:30:34.291
IT'S IT'S SO YOU HAVE.

02:30:34.358 --> 02:30:36.460
THIS OPERATES TOGETHER.

02:30:36.527 --> 02:30:37.261
SO.

02:30:37.328 --> 02:30:38.763
YES PROVIDERS RIGHT SO SO SO I

02:30:38.829 --> 02:30:41.098
GUESS IN TERMS OF HOW ARE WE

02:30:41.165 --> 02:30:44.001
BRINGING THOSE TWO PIECES

02:30:44.068 --> 02:30:44.602
TOGETHER WE HAVE THE HAVE THE

02:30:44.668 --> 02:30:46.771
SCOPE SPOKE HERE WITH WHAT WE'RE

02:30:46.837 --> 02:30:47.605
DOING WITH THE IDEA SO HOW HOW

02:30:47.671 --> 02:30:49.340
DO YOU SEE THAT COMING TOGETHER

02:30:49.407 --> 02:30:51.809
AND THE EVOLUTION OF THAT.

02:30:51.876 --> 02:30:52.777
BECAUSE AS WE TALK ABOUT THE

02:30:52.843 --> 02:30:55.546
NEXT WEAVER PROBABLY WANT TO

02:30:55.613 --> 02:30:56.080
THINK ABOUT HOW THESE TWO

02:30:56.147 --> 02:30:57.548
INTERFACE.

02:30:57.615 --> 02:30:59.183
SO YES WHEN WE DEVELOP THE HUB

02:30:59.250 --> 02:30:59.650
AND SPOKE --

02:30:59.717 --> 02:31:01.085
FIRST OF ALL ALL HUGS AND ANY

02:31:01.152 --> 02:31:02.820
SPOKES HAVE TO OFFER MEDICAL AS

02:31:02.887 --> 02:31:04.655
WELL I'M AND WE DID THAT FOR

02:31:04.722 --> 02:31:06.223
SUSTAINABILITY BECAUSE WE WANTED

02:31:06.290 --> 02:31:07.491
TO ENSURE FOR GOING TO INVEST IN

02:31:07.558 --> 02:31:09.126
TRAIN PHYSICIANS AND PROVIDE THE

02:31:09.193 --> 02:31:11.262
SERVICES --

02:31:11.328 --> 02:31:11.862
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THAT BUT

02:31:11.929 --> 02:31:15.199
WHAT'S CAN REACH BEYOND.

02:31:15.266 --> 02:31:16.734
THE MEDICAL PATIENTS SO WE CAN

02:31:16.801 --> 02:31:18.135
SERVE ANY INDIVIDUAL THAT WALKS

02:31:18.202 --> 02:31:19.336
THROUGH THE DOOR --

02:31:19.403 --> 02:31:20.805
BUT SO IT REALLY HAS BEEN AND

02:31:20.871 --> 02:31:22.106
AND YOU'RE RIGHT IT GOES RIGHT

02:31:22.173 --> 02:31:23.808
THE FUNDING GOES RIGHT TO THE

02:31:23.874 --> 02:31:24.809
PROVIDERS --

02:31:24.875 --> 02:31:26.076
BUT THEN OBVIOUSLY THE COUNTIES

02:31:26.143 --> 02:31:28.245
CAN ACCESS THOSE INCREASE

02:31:28.312 --> 02:31:29.480
SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE NOW

02:31:29.547 --> 02:31:30.614
IN THAT THERE'S MORE M. A. T.

02:31:30.681 --> 02:31:34.084
AVAILABLE THAT THEY CAN UTILIZE --

02:31:34.151 --> 02:31:35.519
FOR THE DRUG MEDI CAL WAIVER

02:31:35.586 --> 02:31:37.121
VINEY THE FEDERAL MONEY THAT

02:31:37.188 --> 02:31:38.856
LIKE HOW IT'S AT A FIXED AMOUNT

02:31:38.923 --> 02:31:40.524
OF MONEY OR IS IT OKAY SO IT'S

02:31:40.591 --> 02:31:41.926
IT'S JUST NINETY MILLION THAT IS

02:31:41.992 --> 02:31:45.863
JUST A YES JUST NINETY MILLION

02:31:45.930 --> 02:31:46.030
SO.

02:31:46.096 --> 02:31:47.298
AND OKAY.

02:31:47.364 --> 02:31:48.599
SO WE WILL TALK ABOUT WHAT

02:31:48.666 --> 02:31:50.568
HAPPENS AND YOU SELL HOPING THAT

02:31:50.634 --> 02:31:51.602
THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET THERE'S

02:31:51.669 --> 02:31:52.436
AN EXTENSION OF THAT AND SO YES

02:31:52.503 --> 02:31:54.104
FROM THE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE HOW.

02:31:54.171 --> 02:31:54.738
THE INTERFACE WITH HAVE BEEN

02:31:54.805 --> 02:31:57.007
SPOKEN THE FUNDING THAT GOES

02:31:57.074 --> 02:31:58.642
THERE SURE SO THE THE FUNDING

02:31:58.709 --> 02:32:00.044
DOES GO DIRECTLY FROM FROM THE

02:32:00.110 --> 02:32:01.612
DEPARTMENT TO THE PROVIDERS THAT

02:32:01.679 --> 02:32:03.380
THEY CONTRACT WITH BUT BECAUSE

02:32:03.447 --> 02:32:05.082
THEY ARE ALL IN OUR NETWORKS.

02:32:05.149 --> 02:32:06.150
WE MAKE SURE THAT WE DO

02:32:06.217 --> 02:32:07.518
COORDINATE VERY INTENTIONALLY

02:32:07.585 --> 02:32:10.254
WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE OF THAT --

02:32:10.321 --> 02:32:12.156
WERE WORKING ON ON CONVENING

02:32:12.223 --> 02:32:13.858
SPOKES POSSIBLY FOR THEM IN THE

02:32:13.924 --> 02:32:15.659
RECRUITMENT EFFORTS THAT THEY

02:32:15.726 --> 02:32:16.894
ARE STANDARDIZING THEIR

02:32:16.961 --> 02:32:17.895
APPROACHES WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT

02:32:17.962 --> 02:32:19.230
HUBS FOR EXAMPLE IN LOS ANGELES

02:32:19.296 --> 02:32:20.397
COUNTY WE'RE TRYING TO ALIGN

02:32:20.464 --> 02:32:21.999
MARKETING MATERIALS WE HAVE

02:32:22.066 --> 02:32:24.902
REGULAR MEETINGS WITH THEM --

02:32:24.969 --> 02:32:25.703
TO TO ALSO UNDERSTAND THE

02:32:25.769 --> 02:32:27.171
UNIVERSE OF POTENTIAL SPOKES IN

02:32:27.238 --> 02:32:28.906
THE COUNTY BECAUSE WE HAVE I

02:32:28.973 --> 02:32:30.241
THINK INFORMATION THAT IS IS

02:32:30.307 --> 02:32:31.876
HELPFUL TO THEM IN THEIR EFFORTS

02:32:31.942 --> 02:32:33.244
TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

02:32:33.310 --> 02:32:35.346
AND TO INCREASE THE REACH OF MIT

02:32:35.412 --> 02:32:35.946
SO THAT IS DEFINITELY I THINK

02:32:36.013 --> 02:32:36.814
SOMETHING THAT.

02:32:36.881 --> 02:32:38.716
COUNTIES ARE MINDFUL OF AND WANT

02:32:38.782 --> 02:32:40.084
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT.

02:32:40.150 --> 02:32:41.919
DUPLICATIVE OR UNCOORDINATED BUT

02:32:41.986 --> 02:32:43.387
RATHER SOMETHING THAT ADDS TO

02:32:43.454 --> 02:32:46.557
WHAT WE'RE ALREADY DOING IS

02:32:46.624 --> 02:32:48.259
PARTLY SAID.

02:32:48.325 --> 02:32:50.995
AND MAYBE THIS IS A QUESTION.

02:32:51.061 --> 02:32:53.130
FOR ON THE PRIOR SPLIT --

02:32:53.197 --> 02:32:54.164
ALICE BUT IS THERE CHALLENGES

02:32:54.231 --> 02:32:56.700
RECRUITING SPOKES.

02:32:56.767 --> 02:32:59.370
pSO YEAH IF CHALLENGES IN

02:32:59.436 --> 02:33:00.804
RECRUITING SPOKE OTHERS ACTUALLY

02:33:00.871 --> 02:33:02.239
IF IF MORE PEOPLE SIGN UP THE

02:33:02.306 --> 02:33:03.474
SPOKES WE COULD WE HAVE THE

02:33:03.541 --> 02:33:05.142
CAPACITY TAKE THE MONARCHY WILL

02:33:05.209 --> 02:33:06.544
FIX GRANT IT CETERA AND SO I'M

02:33:06.610 --> 02:33:06.844
JUST.

02:33:06.911 --> 02:33:08.012
JUST SAY CELL IS RATE LET ME

02:33:08.078 --> 02:33:09.413
STEP THE NUMBER PEOPLE WILLING

02:33:09.480 --> 02:33:12.850
TO BE SPOKES ARE THE NUMBERS

02:33:12.917 --> 02:33:14.451
FOLKS WERE ABLE TO HANDLE.

02:33:14.518 --> 02:33:15.553
YEAH SO THERE IS A CHALLENGING

02:33:15.619 --> 02:33:16.487
RECRUITING SPOKES --

02:33:16.554 --> 02:33:17.988
BUT A LOT THE HUBS OF DONE AND

02:33:18.055 --> 02:33:19.256
THERE SPOKE A LOT ABOUT IT THEY

02:33:19.323 --> 02:33:21.692
WERE VERY AGGRESSIVE AND CAN'T

BOARD --

02:33:28.933 --> 02:33:30.301
THERE'S BEEN EFFORTS NOW TO HAVE

02:33:30.367 --> 02:33:31.602
JAIL SO SPOKES --

02:33:31.669 --> 02:33:33.237
TRIBAL HEALTH CLINICS OTHER

02:33:33.304 --> 02:33:34.505
ENTITIES IT SEEMS LIKE MORE

02:33:34.572 --> 02:33:36.073
FOLKS ARE RAISING THEIR HANDS --

02:33:36.140 --> 02:33:37.575
AT SOME POINT THOUGH IT DOES

02:33:37.641 --> 02:33:39.276
BECOME AN ISSUE A CAPACITY FOR

02:33:39.343 --> 02:33:41.579
THE HUB AS WELL I'M BECAUSE

02:33:41.645 --> 02:33:43.147
THAT'S A LOT OF SPOKE TO SOLVE.

02:33:43.213 --> 02:33:44.081
THE HOW THE DO WE NEED MORE HUBS

02:33:44.148 --> 02:33:45.516

02:33:45.583 --> 02:33:46.951
CHALLENGE OF YOU KNOW AND IT'S

02:33:47.017 --> 02:33:48.986
BEEN A VERY QUICK RAMP UP AS YOU

IN EXISTENCE FOR A FEW YEARS --

02:33:52.289 --> 02:33:55.192
BUT THERE HAS BEEN A LOT MORE

02:33:55.259 --> 02:33:55.726
INTEREST IN IT [inaudible]

02:33:55.793 --> 02:33:57.561
SO.

MORE PEOPLE TO BE.

02:34:17.815 --> 02:34:18.716
WILLING TO STAND UP AND BE

02:34:33.530 --> 02:34:36.000
BE BROUGHT ON BROAD YEARS

02:34:36.066 --> 02:34:37.635
WHATEVER SORT OF MEETING THERE

02:34:37.701 --> 02:34:39.136
ISN'T SUBS TO BE USE.

02:34:39.203 --> 02:34:41.038
APPROACH TO SUBSEA PEWS AND AND

02:34:41.105 --> 02:34:43.407
SUCCESSFUL MODELS LIKE LIKE WHAT

I THINK UNQUESTIONABLY A

02:34:47.411 --> 02:34:50.180
SUCCESSFUL MODEL TO REACH OUT

02:34:50.247 --> 02:34:51.949

THESE KIND OF THINGS --

02:35:09.266 --> 02:35:10.868
THE GENERAL POPULATION DOCTORS

02:35:10.934 --> 02:35:13.070
AT LARGE OR OR PERHAPS NOT SO

02:35:13.137 --> 02:35:14.805

STIGMA AND AND THAT'S JUST

02:35:23.280 --> 02:35:24.081

EVERY DAY.

02:35:35.826 --> 02:35:37.161
OF COVERAGE OF ELECTION AS BUT

02:35:37.227 --> 02:35:39.463
ALSO THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL

HEALTH SYSTEMS IN PROVIDERS WERE

02:46:52.102 --> 02:46:53.336
PRESENT IN THOSE SPACES TO BE

02:46:53.403 --> 02:46:55.705

ACROSS THE DIFFERENT STATE

02:47:05.782 --> 02:47:07.650
BRANCHES ALSO DO THAT WITH THEIR

02:47:07.717 --> 02:47:08.685
STAKEHOLDER --

02:47:08.752 --> 02:47:09.519
NETWORKS THAT THEY HAVE

02:47:09.586 --> 02:47:11.488
AVAILABLE SO THAT'S THE PROCESS

02:47:11.554 --> 02:47:12.989
THAT WE USE AT THIS TIME.

02:47:13.056 --> 02:47:14.257
A YOU MENTION A COLLABORATION

02:47:14.324 --> 02:47:15.792
WITH CORNERS MEDICAL EXAMINERS

02:47:15.859 --> 02:47:17.560
CAN DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT YES

02:47:17.627 --> 02:47:19.062
THAT'S TO HELP INCREASE THE

02:47:19.129 --> 02:47:21.765
DEPTH AND THE CONTEXT AROUND THE

02:47:21.831 --> 02:47:23.133
DATA WE HAVE AROUND --

02:47:23.199 --> 02:47:24.567
**** OPIATE OVERDOSE EVENTS FROM

02:47:24.634 --> 02:47:25.935
A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE ONE

02:47:26.002 --> 02:47:27.170
OF THE MAIN THINGS WERE TRYING

02:47:27.237 --> 02:47:28.738
TO DO IS BETTER UNDERSTAND.

02:47:28.805 --> 02:47:30.140
THE RISK PATHWAYS THAT ARE

02:47:30.206 --> 02:47:31.608
LEADING TO OVERDOSE WE CAN GET

02:47:31.674 --> 02:47:32.976
RID BECAUSE AND TARGET

02:47:33.042 --> 02:47:34.811
INTERVENTIONS MORE EFFECTIVELY.

02:47:34.878 --> 02:47:36.179
AND AS YOU'VE SEEN FROM THE DATA

02:47:36.246 --> 02:47:37.046
THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT

02:47:37.113 --> 02:47:38.615
DYNAMICS AT PLAY AT THE SAME

02:47:38.681 --> 02:47:40.083
TIME WITH OPIATES WE'VE GOT

02:47:40.150 --> 02:47:40.650
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE

02:47:40.717 --> 02:47:42.552
AFFECTING SORT OF YOUNGER ADULTS

02:47:42.619 --> 02:47:43.887
VERSUS MIDDLE AGE WE'VE GOT THE

02:47:43.953 --> 02:47:45.688
SYNTHETIC AN ILLICIT OPIATES

02:47:45.755 --> 02:47:47.023
VERSUS PRESCRIPTION.

02:47:47.090 --> 02:47:48.958
SO WHEN WE WORK WITH CORNERS THE

02:47:49.025 --> 02:47:50.260
MEDICAL EXAMINER'S ITS SHOULD

02:47:50.326 --> 02:47:51.461
HAVE THEM CAPTURE ADDITIONAL

02:47:51.528 --> 02:47:53.763
CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION AROUND

02:47:53.830 --> 02:47:55.165
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF AN OVERDOSE

02:47:55.231 --> 02:47:56.533
SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO USE THAT

02:47:56.599 --> 02:47:59.602
IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THOSE

02:47:59.669 --> 02:48:00.937
RISK PATHWAYS.

02:48:01.004 --> 02:48:02.205
ARM AND I GUESS JUST OF FINE

02:48:02.272 --> 02:48:04.307
FINALLY AND I THINK THIS IS

02:48:04.374 --> 02:48:05.742
SOMETHING THAT I HAVE.

02:48:05.809 --> 02:48:06.910
KIND OF REPEATEDLY ASKED YOU

WE IS THE LEGISLATURE IN

02:48:10.580 --> 02:48:12.048
OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE WORKING BEHIND

02:48:12.115 --> 02:48:14.083
THE SCENES OUT THERE.

02:48:14.150 --> 02:48:14.984
IS THERE WHAT CAN THE

02:48:15.051 --> 02:48:16.653
LEGISLATURE DUE TO HELP MOVE

02:48:16.719 --> 02:48:18.354
SOME OF THESE THINGS FORWARD

02:48:18.421 --> 02:48:20.824
BECAUSE I I'VE [inaudible]

02:48:20.890 --> 02:48:22.659
FEEL.

02:48:22.725 --> 02:48:25.061
WHILE THERE IS PROGRESS.

02:48:29.165 --> 02:48:31.234
PROVIDERS TO ACTUALLY. TO WORK

02:48:31.301 --> 02:48:32.469
IN THE SPACE --

02:48:32.535 --> 02:48:35.772
WE CAN'T GET ACCESS TO PEOPLE --

02:48:35.839 --> 02:48:37.674
WE HAVE A WORK FORCE SHORES SO

02:48:37.740 --> 02:48:39.342
WHAT WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO AND

02:48:39.409 --> 02:48:40.910
THAT'S THE KIND OF GUIDANCE THAT

02:48:40.977 --> 02:48:42.612
I'M PERSONALLY LOOKING.

02:48:42.679 --> 02:48:46.916
FOR HELP US WITH DIED AND YOU IF

02:48:46.983 --> 02:48:48.117
YOU'RE IN YOUR SIX YEAR OF THIS

02:48:48.184 --> 02:48:49.085
TASK FORCE NOW.

02:48:49.152 --> 02:48:52.188
WHEN CAN WE EXPECT?

02:48:52.255 --> 02:48:54.157
SOMETHING THAT CAN HELP AS A

02:48:54.224 --> 02:48:56.392
GUIDE FOR FURTHER ACTIVITY THEY

02:48:56.459 --> 02:48:58.461
WORK A DOZEN BILLS LAST YEAR

02:48:58.528 --> 02:49:01.731
RELATED TO OPIOIDS OUT THERE --

02:49:01.798 --> 02:49:03.199
AND YOU'RE DOING ALL THIS WORK

02:49:03.266 --> 02:49:06.436
BUT IS THERE SOMETHING WE CAN BE

02:49:06.503 --> 02:49:08.037
DOING THAT WE'RE NOT DOING.

02:49:08.104 --> 02:49:09.939
THAT BASED ON ALL THE STUDY AND

02:49:10.006 --> 02:49:11.307
ALL THE WORK.

02:49:11.374 --> 02:49:13.409
THAT WE'RE MISSING HERE --

02:49:13.476 --> 02:49:15.612
AND WHAT IS KIND OF WE'RE NOT

02:49:15.678 --> 02:49:17.247
THE I'M NOT THE EXPERT I'M NOT

02:49:17.313 --> 02:49:18.181
OF I'M NOT A PUBLIC HEALTH

02:49:18.248 --> 02:49:18.414
EXPERT.

02:49:18.481 --> 02:49:20.350
BUT I AM.

02:49:20.416 --> 02:49:21.818
KIND OF WAITING.

02:49:21.885 --> 02:49:25.922
AND AND I'M I DON'T HOW LONG AM

02:49:25.989 --> 02:49:27.156
I GONNA BE WAITING OR IS OR WAS

02:49:27.223 --> 02:49:28.525
THERE EVER GONNA BE

02:49:28.591 --> 02:49:29.225
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT COME OUT OF

02:49:29.292 --> 02:49:30.059
THIS WORK.

02:49:30.126 --> 02:49:32.295
THIS GROUP FOR SOMETHING WE CAN

02:49:32.362 --> 02:49:33.096
BE DOING AT THE LEGISLATIVE

02:49:33.162 --> 02:49:37.400
LEVEL TO HELP MOVE THIS ALONG.

02:49:37.467 --> 02:49:39.602
THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND

02:49:39.669 --> 02:49:40.236
THAT IS SOMETHING I THINK JUST

02:49:40.303 --> 02:49:41.771
EVEN HEARING THAT IS SOMETHING

02:49:41.838 --> 02:49:43.306
THAT.

02:49:43.373 --> 02:49:44.374
IS OBVIOUSLY VERY ENCOURAGING TO

02:49:44.440 --> 02:49:45.575
THE MANY THE MANY DIFFERENT

02:49:45.642 --> 02:49:46.676
SECTORS THAT ARE WORKING IN THIS

02:49:46.743 --> 02:49:48.044
AND KNOWING THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:49:48.111 --> 02:49:49.279
WANTS TO BE A KEY PARTNER IN

02:49:49.345 --> 02:49:51.080
THAT AND HAS FOR FOR QUITE SOME

02:49:51.147 --> 02:49:51.614
TIME.

02:49:51.681 --> 02:49:52.849
I THINK I'VE ASKED THIS BEFORE

02:49:52.916 --> 02:49:54.384
THIS IS NOT CERTAINLY NO NOT AT

02:49:54.450 --> 02:49:55.318
ALL BUT I APPRECIATE YOU

02:49:55.385 --> 02:49:56.853
REITERATING THAT.

02:49:56.920 --> 02:49:58.321
I THINK THAT --

02:49:58.388 --> 02:49:59.989
THESE VENUES WHEN WE'RE TRYING

02:50:00.056 --> 02:50:01.424
TO PROVIDE WHEN YOU REQUESTED

02:50:01.491 --> 02:50:02.892
THESE UPDATES FOR US TO BE ABLE

02:50:02.959 --> 02:50:03.927
TO SHARE.

02:50:03.993 --> 02:50:05.228
THE STATUS AND TO DO AGAIN ON

02:50:05.295 --> 02:50:06.362
THE BARRIERS I THINK THAT THAT'S

02:50:06.429 --> 02:50:07.764
SOMETHING THAT IS VERY HELPFUL

02:50:07.830 --> 02:50:09.899
CERTAINLY I THINK ANYTHING THAT

02:50:09.966 --> 02:50:10.900
IS HELPING US ELEVATE THE

02:50:10.967 --> 02:50:12.802
SALIENCE OF THE ISSUE AND THE

02:50:12.869 --> 02:50:16.005
ISSUE IT GREATER PENETRATION

02:50:16.072 --> 02:50:17.206
INTO THE AREAS WHERE WE'RE STILL

02:50:17.273 --> 02:50:18.274
SEEING GAPS.

02:50:18.341 --> 02:50:19.375
I THINK THAT'S AN EXTREMELY

02:50:19.442 --> 02:50:21.110
IMPORTANT ROLE --

02:50:21.177 --> 02:50:22.111
THAT YOU ALL ARE CURRENTLY

02:50:22.178 --> 02:50:23.780
PLAYING AND CAN CONTINUE TO PLAY

02:50:23.846 --> 02:50:25.615
I THINK THAT THERE WE'VE ALSO

02:50:25.682 --> 02:50:26.482
HEARD SOME OF THE QUESTIONS

02:50:26.549 --> 02:50:27.483
AROUND WHAT ARE THE SORT OF

02:50:27.550 --> 02:50:28.985
POLICY BARRIERS THAT WE MIGHT BE

02:50:29.052 --> 02:50:30.787
ABLE TO COLLECTIVELY ADDRESS AND

02:50:30.853 --> 02:50:31.387
I THINK THAT SOMETHING THAT WE

02:50:31.454 --> 02:50:32.488
CAN.

02:50:32.555 --> 02:50:34.824
DIVING DEEPER TOGETHER ON IN

02:50:34.891 --> 02:50:36.960
SPECIFIC AREAS OF FOCUS --

02:50:37.026 --> 02:50:38.161
BUT I THINK THAT THOSE ARE VERY

02:50:38.227 --> 02:50:39.629
HELPFUL I THINK THAT --

02:50:39.696 --> 02:50:41.998
BE HAPPY TO ALSO GO BACK AND GET

02:50:42.065 --> 02:50:43.633
FURTHER INFORMATION TO PUT THEM

02:50:43.700 --> 02:50:45.468
IN TERMS OF SPECIFICS THAT YOU'D

02:50:45.535 --> 02:50:46.703
LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT.

02:50:46.769 --> 02:50:47.704
IN THOSE MORE TANGIBLE

02:50:47.770 --> 02:50:49.772
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE

02:50:49.839 --> 02:50:50.840
RECOMMENDATIONS COMING OUT OF

02:50:50.907 --> 02:50:51.341
THE WORK GROUP.

02:50:51.407 --> 02:50:53.876
I'D ALSO SAY THAT ONE OF THE THE

02:50:53.943 --> 02:50:55.311
STRUCTURE OF THE WORK GROUP AT

02:50:55.378 --> 02:50:57.080
PRESENT IS LARGELY AROUND HOW DO

02:50:57.146 --> 02:50:58.581
WE AMPLIFY THE EXISTING

02:50:58.648 --> 02:51:00.483
ACTIVITIES THAT ARE HAPPENING.

02:51:00.550 --> 02:51:02.352
IN EACH ORGANIZATION ONE OF THE

02:51:02.418 --> 02:51:04.687
KEY GAPS THAT WE TRY TO ADDRESS

02:51:04.754 --> 02:51:06.422
IS TO BRIDGE THE SILOS ACROSS

02:51:06.489 --> 02:51:07.924
THE FUNDING THAT'S GOING OUT.

02:51:07.991 --> 02:51:09.325
AND TO HELP LINK UNDERSTANDING

02:51:09.392 --> 02:51:11.527
ACROSS SECTORS AND BETWEEN THE

02:51:11.594 --> 02:51:13.529
STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL SO.

02:51:13.596 --> 02:51:17.500
THAT VENUE IS PREDOMINATELY --

02:51:17.567 --> 02:51:20.603
AND THAT THE ALSO COME THROUGH

02:51:20.670 --> 02:51:22.338
THOSE RESPECTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND

02:51:22.405 --> 02:51:23.473
THOSE PROGRAMS --

02:51:23.539 --> 02:51:24.607
AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE WAYS

02:51:24.674 --> 02:51:25.742
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO TO NARROW

02:51:25.808 --> 02:51:27.910
IN ON THAT.

02:51:27.977 --> 02:51:29.846
SO HOW'S THAT GOING.

02:51:29.912 --> 02:51:31.247
I THINK IT'S GOING VERY WELL I

02:51:31.314 --> 02:51:33.182
MEAN I THINK THAT THE THE WORK

02:51:33.249 --> 02:51:35.351
THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT TODAY.

02:51:35.418 --> 02:51:37.453
EACH ONE OF THOSE ACTIVITIES IS

02:51:37.520 --> 02:51:38.621
SUPPORTED --

02:51:38.688 --> 02:51:39.789
AND EXTENDED THROUGH THE

02:51:39.856 --> 02:51:41.357
COLLABORATION WE HAVE ACROSS OUR

02:51:41.424 --> 02:51:43.292
SECTORS THE DATA THAT WE'RE

02:51:43.359 --> 02:51:45.862
USING IN OUR DISCUSSION TODAY.

02:51:45.928 --> 02:51:46.929
AND THAT WE'VE ACCESS TO THE

02:51:46.996 --> 02:51:48.564
DATA DASHBOARD COMES FROM A

02:51:48.631 --> 02:51:49.866
PARTNERSHIP THAT IN IT WAS

02:51:49.932 --> 02:51:51.401
INITIATED WHEN THE CALIFORNIA

02:51:51.467 --> 02:51:52.735
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SAID WE

02:51:52.802 --> 02:51:53.903
THINK THAT THIS.

02:51:53.970 --> 02:51:55.571
INFORMATION ABOUT PRESCRIBING

02:51:55.638 --> 02:51:56.973
COULD BE USED FOR PREVENTION BUT

02:51:57.040 --> 02:51:58.641
WE UNDERSTAND WE'RE NOT THE MOST

02:51:58.708 --> 02:52:00.276
EFFECTIVE MESSENGER FOR THAT.

02:52:00.343 --> 02:52:02.045
WHO CAN PARTNER WITH US TO MAKE

02:52:02.111 --> 02:52:03.980
THAT AVAILABLE SO IT'S A SORT OF

02:52:04.047 --> 02:52:05.281
CROSS DEPARTMENTAL?

02:52:05.348 --> 02:52:07.450
LINKAGES TO BE ABLE TO FIND HOW

02:52:07.517 --> 02:52:09.218
WE CAN USE OUR RESPECTIVE

02:52:09.285 --> 02:52:10.019
STRENGTHS --

02:52:10.086 --> 02:52:11.421
AND ADDRESS GAPS THAT I THINK

02:52:11.487 --> 02:52:13.056
ARE THE RESULT IN THE FOCUS OF

02:52:13.122 --> 02:52:15.958
THE WORK GROUP AND THAT'S WHY I

02:52:16.025 --> 02:52:16.559
THINK THERE'S BEEN TREMENDOUS

02:52:16.626 --> 02:52:17.660
PROGRESS.

02:52:17.727 --> 02:52:19.395
SO I GUESS I WOULD GO BUT AND OF

02:52:19.462 --> 02:52:20.663
I GUESS WE'LL TWO FIVE TWO

02:52:20.730 --> 02:52:22.565
QUESTIONS AND I'LL I'LL MOVE ON

02:52:22.632 --> 02:52:22.832
ONE IS --

02:52:22.899 --> 02:52:23.599
WITH REGARDS TO QUARTERS AND

02:52:23.666 --> 02:52:25.435
MEDICAL EXAMINERS ARE IS THERE

02:52:25.501 --> 02:52:30.473
ANY PUSH TO ENCOURAGE --

02:52:30.540 --> 02:52:32.809
REAL DATA SO WE ACTUALLY KNOW I

02:52:32.875 --> 02:52:34.277
MEAN ARE THEY DOING TOXICOLOGY

02:52:34.343 --> 02:52:35.878
SCANS ON ALL CASES THAT THEY

02:52:35.945 --> 02:52:38.581
SUSPECT MIGHT BE RELATED TO AN

02:52:38.648 --> 02:52:39.382
OVERDOSE.

02:52:39.449 --> 02:52:40.516
OUR AND IS THAT DATA AVAILABLE

02:52:40.583 --> 02:52:42.652
BECAUSE I DO WONDER ABOUT UNDER

02:52:42.719 --> 02:52:44.721
REPORTING QUITE FRANKLY.

02:52:44.787 --> 02:52:46.222
AND SO IS THE BAG TO THE THE

02:52:46.289 --> 02:52:47.724
PROBLEM BIGGER OR SMALLER OR DO

02:52:47.790 --> 02:52:49.592
WE ACTUALLY KNOW --

02:52:49.659 --> 02:52:52.829
IF IF IF THEIR ACTUAL ECOLOGY ON

02:52:52.895 --> 02:52:55.665
ON THESE CASES OR DO WE KNOW

02:52:55.732 --> 02:52:57.734
THAT.

02:52:57.800 --> 02:52:58.868
I THINK THE INTENT OF THAT WORK

02:52:58.935 --> 02:53:00.703
IS TO EXPAND THE DEPTH AND THE

02:53:00.770 --> 02:53:02.405
EFFECTIVENESS OF THAT DATA AND

02:53:02.472 --> 02:53:03.573
TO EXPAND --

02:53:03.639 --> 02:53:04.974
WHAT'S BEING COLLECTED THERE SO

02:53:05.041 --> 02:53:06.342
I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING

02:53:06.409 --> 02:53:07.944
THAT WE'VE BEEN INCREASING

02:53:08.010 --> 02:53:09.345
LEASING HAPPEN --

02:53:09.412 --> 02:53:10.580
AND THAT THERE ARE RESOURCES

02:53:10.646 --> 02:53:11.581
AVAILABLE THAT ARE HELPING

02:53:11.647 --> 02:53:12.849
CORNERS THE MEDICAL EXAMINER'S

02:53:12.915 --> 02:53:13.583
TO DO THAT BUT THAT OUT REACH

02:53:13.649 --> 02:53:14.917
HAS TO DO WITH HELPING THEM

02:53:14.984 --> 02:53:17.520
pUNDERSTAND.

02:53:17.587 --> 02:53:18.755
THAT NECESSITY AND TRY TO FIND.

02:53:18.821 --> 02:53:19.922
EXACTLY THE ANSWER TO THE

02:53:19.989 --> 02:53:21.057
QUESTION THAT YOU'RE ASKING IS

02:53:21.124 --> 02:53:23.860
HOW MUCH DO WE ACTUALLY --

02:53:23.926 --> 02:53:25.194
HOW WIDELY ARE WE ACTUALLY

02:53:25.261 --> 02:53:27.663
CAPTURING THAT DATA?

02:53:27.730 --> 02:53:29.398
SO I GUESS IN MY FINAL QUESTION

02:53:29.465 --> 02:53:30.600
COME BACK TO YOU.

02:53:30.666 --> 02:53:32.468
I GUESS YOU KNOW AFTER FOUR

02:53:32.535 --> 02:53:33.803
YEARS I'M STILL KIND OF WAITING

02:53:33.870 --> 02:53:35.972
FOR THOSE.

02:53:36.038 --> 02:53:38.074
THIS COULD BE REALLY HELPFUL.

02:53:38.141 --> 02:53:40.510
COULD WE DO IS THERE SOME THE DO

02:53:40.576 --> 02:53:41.144
YOU UNDERSTAND WHERE I'M COMING

02:53:41.210 --> 02:53:42.111
FROM.

02:53:42.178 --> 02:53:43.579
THIS COULD BE REALLY HELPFUL

02:53:43.646 --> 02:53:46.315
WE'RE WILLING TO TAKE THAT RISK.

02:53:46.382 --> 02:53:48.518
I UNDERSTAND THAT MAY BE THE

02:53:48.584 --> 02:53:50.186
DEPARTMENT IS NOT.

02:53:50.253 --> 02:53:52.121
BUT I AS A EGISLATOR I'M SEEING

02:53:52.188 --> 02:53:54.056
PEOPLE DIE IN MY DISTRICT I AM

02:53:54.123 --> 02:53:55.591
WILLING TO TAKE A RISK ON MOVING

02:53:55.658 --> 02:53:57.360
A POLICY FORWARD THAT MIGHT BE

02:53:57.426 --> 02:53:58.828
CONTROVERSIAL.

02:53:58.895 --> 02:54:00.463
THAT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT FOR

02:54:00.530 --> 02:54:02.165
PEOPLE TO ACCEPT IN THE IN THE

02:54:02.231 --> 02:54:03.466
IN THE GOAL OF TRYING TO SAVE

02:54:03.533 --> 02:54:05.434
PEOPLE'S LIVES.

02:54:05.501 --> 02:54:06.936
AND AND SO [inaudible]

02:54:07.003 --> 02:54:08.704
I GUESS.

02:54:08.771 --> 02:54:12.074
I'M HOPING FOR MORE THAN.

02:54:12.141 --> 02:54:13.442
I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE ALL WORKING

02:54:13.509 --> 02:54:14.610
TOGETHER AND I THINK THAT'S

02:54:14.677 --> 02:54:16.045
GREAT AND THE AND AND UP BUT I

02:54:16.112 --> 02:54:17.280
ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT GOVERNMENT

02:54:17.346 --> 02:54:20.850
HAS SILOS AND THAT FRUSTRATES ME.

02:54:20.917 --> 02:54:22.819
HUGE AMOUNT --

02:54:22.885 --> 02:54:24.487
AND I WISH WE COULD NOT COME ALL

02:54:24.554 --> 02:54:26.155
DOWN WHICH ON A ROOM TO MAKE IT

02:54:26.222 --> 02:54:27.490
ALL WORK TOGETHER --

02:54:27.557 --> 02:54:28.591
AND COLLABORATE ON THESE THINGS

02:54:28.658 --> 02:54:30.693
BUT I WILL GO BACK THAT I'M

02:54:30.760 --> 02:54:32.562
STILL WAITING FOR THOSE THESE

02:54:32.628 --> 02:54:34.430
ARE THINGS THAT WE THINK COULD

02:54:34.497 --> 02:54:36.899
WORK ON A MUCH LARGER SCALE.

02:54:36.966 --> 02:54:40.136
AND HELP US TO HELP BECAUSE THIS

02:54:40.203 --> 02:54:44.574
PROBLEM WHILE IT IS IS THE IS

02:54:44.640 --> 02:54:46.175

TALKING ABOUT THAT IS COMING OUT

03:02:59.568 --> 03:03:00.703
YEARS OF DISCUSSION.

03:03:00.769 --> 03:03:02.037
AND THE PLAN TO EVALUATE THE

03:03:02.104 --> 03:03:03.505
IMPACT OF THOSE CHANGES NOW

03:03:03.572 --> 03:03:04.473
HOPEFULLY MAYBE WE HAVE THE

03:03:04.540 --> 03:03:05.541
SYSTEM WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

03:03:05.607 --> 03:03:07.076
BETTER MEASURE THAT.

03:03:07.142 --> 03:03:09.244
RIGHT AND THEN ALSO BILL THIS IS

03:03:09.311 --> 03:03:10.479

03:03:10.546 --> 03:03:11.280
SAMPLE ARE YOU WORKING WITH THE

03:03:11.347 --> 03:03:12.548
BEAVER HEALTH DIRECTORS I JUST

03:03:12.614 --> 03:03:13.982
CHALLENGED THEM TO SAY WELL WHAT

03:03:14.049 --> 03:03:15.384
WE DO ABOUT THE SMALLER COUNTIES

03:03:15.451 --> 03:03:16.485
MEDIUM SMALL COUNTIES WHO DIED

03:03:16.552 --> 03:03:17.586
THE INFRASTRUCTURE.

03:03:17.653 --> 03:03:18.787
RIGHT SO IT'S GREAT TO HEAR FROM

03:03:18.854 --> 03:03:22.624
THE SUCCESSES BUT I WONDER WHY

03:03:22.691 --> 03:03:25.027
THE ONES WHO ARE DOING AS WELL.

03:03:25.094 --> 03:03:26.595

03:03:28.030 --> 03:03:28.597
PERFORMING AT THAT'S GREAT TO

03:03:28.664 --> 03:03:29.932
TALK TO THE TOP PERFORMERS BUT

03:03:29.998 --> 03:03:30.999
ALSO I WANT NO WORD IN MIDDLES

03:03:31.066 --> 03:03:32.134

03:03:32.201 --> 03:03:35.170
THAT KIND OF DISCUSSION ARE NOW

03:03:35.237 --> 03:03:37.673
IS THAT SEPARATE DISCUSSION.

03:03:37.740 --> 03:03:38.273

03:03:48.550 --> 03:03:49.251
DISCUSSION.

03:03:49.318 --> 03:03:50.619
I THINK THAT THE CERTAINLY THE

03:03:50.686 --> 03:03:52.388
CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF UPTAKE

03:03:52.454 --> 03:03:54.990

ALL COUNTIES HAS CERTAINLY BEEN

03:03:58.727 --> 03:04:00.462
A PRIORITY SO LET ME JUST ASK

03:04:00.529 --> 03:04:01.997
ANOTHER QUESTION AND I

CERTAINLY OKAY.

03:04:09.171 --> 03:04:10.038
AGAIN I WANT TO REITERATE RIGHT

03:04:10.105 --> 03:04:12.207
THAT THE THE WAY THAT THE WORK

03:04:12.274 --> 03:04:13.709
GROUP FUNCTIONS.

03:04:13.776 --> 03:04:15.477
IS TO BE ABLE TO BRING THE

03:04:15.544 --> 03:04:16.779
SECTORS TOGETHER RIGHT

03:04:16.845 --> 03:04:17.780
UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THE

03:04:17.846 --> 03:04:18.914
ACTIVITIES THAT WE'RE DOING

03:04:18.981 --> 03:04:20.616
WITHIN THOSE SILOS THAT YOU

03:04:20.682 --> 03:04:22.618
DESCRIBE THIS AND THE FUNDING

03:04:22.684 --> 03:04:23.419
THAT COMES DOWN TO SUPPORT THAT

03:04:23.485 --> 03:04:24.486
WORK.

03:04:24.553 --> 03:04:26.121
IN THE ACTIVITIES OR DESCRIBED%

03:04:26.188 --> 03:04:27.055
THROUGHOUT THE DAY AS WELL AS

03:04:27.122 --> 03:04:28.657
OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT OCCUR AND

03:04:28.724 --> 03:04:29.324
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN THAT

03:04:29.391 --> 03:04:30.025
VENUE.

03:04:30.092 --> 03:04:31.527
IS TO INFORM EACH OTHER'S WORK

03:04:31.593 --> 03:04:32.795
WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT WE

03:04:32.861 --> 03:04:34.596
HAVE FROM EACH OF THOSE SECTORS

03:04:34.663 --> 03:04:36.865
AND PERSPECTIVES. FOR EXAMPLE TO

03:04:36.932 --> 03:04:38.233
BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHEN

03:04:38.300 --> 03:04:40.502
DEVELOPING THE ROLLOUT OF THAT

03:04:40.569 --> 03:04:42.004
HAVE BEEN SPOKE SYSTEM.

03:04:42.070 --> 03:04:43.639
PART OF THE SUPPORT THE DH CS

03:04:43.705 --> 03:04:44.840

03:04:44.907 --> 03:04:46.675
PUBLIC HEALTH IS WE NEED TO RAMP

03:04:46.742 --> 03:04:48.911
UP LOCAL COMMUNITY COALITIONS

03:04:48.977 --> 03:04:49.578
RIGHT SO THAT'S A PRACTICE THAT

03:04:49.645 --> 03:04:51.713
WE IDENTIFIED IN PUBLIC HEALTH

03:04:51.780 --> 03:04:53.515

IDENTIFY THOSE SO THAT'S AN

03:05:07.529 --> 03:05:08.597
EXAMPLE OF THE SORT OF THE

03:05:08.664 --> 03:05:10.332
INTERCHANGE THAT OCCURS TO

03:05:10.399 --> 03:05:11.166

HAVE IN EACH DEPARTMENT THAT'S

03:05:17.506 --> 03:05:18.707
PART OF THE BENEFIT OF THAT.

03:05:18.774 --> 03:05:20.476
BUT THE DESTRUCTION THAT WE HAVE

03:05:20.542 --> 03:05:21.777

UP WITH WHAT WE THINK THE ISSUES

03:05:31.653 --> 03:05:32.754
ARE TO BE ABLE.

03:05:32.821 --> 03:05:34.223

A FEELING A LITTLE FRUSTRATION

03:05:47.669 --> 03:05:48.370
IN THE SENSE THAT.

03:05:48.437 --> 03:05:50.606
WE CERTAINLY SEE VALUE IN THE

03:05:50.672 --> 03:05:51.473

03:06:05.053 --> 03:06:06.822
IMPORTANT IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT

03:06:06.889 --> 03:06:08.156
FIRST STEPS TO DOING THIS AND

03:06:08.223 --> 03:06:09.958

WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THE

03:07:50.726 --> 03:07:51.994
USEFULNESS OF THAT SO THAT'S

03:07:52.060 --> 03:07:54.363
COUNTIES IN COALITIONS CAN GO ON

03:07:54.429 --> 03:07:54.730
AND GET.

03:07:54.796 --> 03:07:55.464

I ASSUMING THAT YOU THAT THERE'S

03:08:18.086 --> 03:08:19.621

THOSE ARE WORKING.

03:08:20.489 --> 03:08:21.723
THAT'S WORKING I THINK THAT'S

03:08:21.790 --> 03:08:23.592
CONTINUOUS ABSOLUTELY I THINK

03:08:23.659 --> 03:08:24.726
THAT ESPECIALLY WITH THIS ISSUE

03:08:24.793 --> 03:08:26.194

SO I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING

03:08:33.268 --> 03:08:35.037
THAT ABSOLUTELY IS CONTINUOUSLY

03:08:35.103 --> 03:08:36.738

AND THAT MEANS THAT'S ACCESS TO

03:14:15.477 --> 03:14:15.677

03:14:15.744 --> 03:14:16.911

ADDICTION PROGRAMS AND

03:15:01.222 --> 03:15:02.524
PROFESSIONALS AND I REALIZE I'M

03:15:02.590 --> 03:15:04.059
PLAYING TO A DWINDLING HOUSE AND

03:15:04.125 --> 03:15:05.326
A HUNGRY CROWD.

03:15:05.393 --> 03:15:07.762
SO KEEP IT SHORT I BASIC FELT

03:15:07.829 --> 03:15:09.798
COMPELLED TO OME UP --

03:15:09.864 --> 03:15:10.865
FOR CHAIRMAN WOULD.

03:15:10.932 --> 03:15:11.966
AB QUESTIONS HE KEEPS SAYING

03:15:12.033 --> 03:15:14.302
WIRE PEOPLE AND MY DISTRICT

03:15:14.369 --> 03:15:16.137
DYING AT HIGHER RATES THAN OTHER

03:15:16.204 --> 03:15:17.172
DISTRICTS.

03:15:17.238 --> 03:15:18.940
AND THEN THE FOLLOW UP IS WHAT

03:15:19.007 --> 03:15:20.608
THE HECK CAN BE DONE AND I DON'T

03:15:20.675 --> 03:15:22.477
FEEL LIKE YOU GOT ANSWERS TO

03:15:22.544 --> 03:15:24.112
EITHER OF THOSE QUESTIONS TODAY.

03:15:24.179 --> 03:15:25.880
SO I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT HUB

03:15:25.947 --> 03:15:27.882
AND SPOKE IS WONDERFUL IT'S

03:15:27.949 --> 03:15:29.284
GREAT IT'S LOVELY.

03:15:29.350 --> 03:15:31.052
IT'S BASICALLY A MEDICATION

03:15:31.119 --> 03:15:36.124
DELIVERY SYSTEM.

03:15:36.191 --> 03:15:37.592
AND I WOULD BE.

03:15:37.659 --> 03:15:38.726
NOT TO SAY THAT IF YOU HAD

03:15:38.793 --> 03:15:39.594
MEDICATION FRICTION.

03:15:39.661 --> 03:15:41.096
AVAILABLE FREE AT EVERY CDS IN

03:15:41.162 --> 03:15:42.097
YOUR DISTRICT I DON'T KNOW THAT

03:15:42.163 --> 03:15:43.231
MAKE THAT MUCH IMPACT IN THE

03:15:43.298 --> 03:15:44.933
RURAL AREAS.

03:15:44.999 --> 03:15:46.801
WHAT'S MISSING IS --

03:15:46.868 --> 03:15:49.237
PEOPLE ARE DYING BECAUSE THEY

03:15:49.304 --> 03:15:50.772
LIKE SEVERAL SPEAKER SAID ARE

03:15:50.839 --> 03:15:51.873
NOT AWARE THEY HAVE ADDICTION OR

03:15:51.940 --> 03:15:53.541
THEY'RE NOT AWARE HOW TO GET IT

03:15:53.608 --> 03:15:54.576
TREATED.

03:15:54.642 --> 03:15:55.810
SO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GO TO A

03:15:55.877 --> 03:15:59.614
POINT TO THE OTHER GROUP OF

03:15:59.681 --> 03:16:00.682
PEOPLE WHO WERE RELAPSE.

03:16:00.748 --> 03:16:02.016
SO THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

03:16:02.083 --> 03:16:04.219
CHANNELS TO GET ILLEGAL DRUGS

03:16:04.285 --> 03:16:04.819
THE MOST DANGEROUS OF WHICH IS

03:16:04.886 --> 03:16:07.555
SPENT ON I'M THEY HAVE AN

03:16:07.622 --> 03:16:09.691
ABILITY TO KNOW HOW TO USE THEM.

03:16:09.757 --> 03:16:10.291
AND THEY HAVE A VERY LOW

03:16:10.358 --> 03:16:11.993
TOLERANCE --

03:16:12.060 --> 03:16:13.928
RELAPSING FROM HER ONE IS

03:16:13.995 --> 03:16:15.096
BASICALLY DEADLY IN MANY CASES.

03:16:15.163 --> 03:16:16.865
SO WHAT'S MISSING IN YOUR AREA

03:16:16.931 --> 03:16:18.800
IN MANY AREAS IN THE STATE IS

03:16:18.867 --> 03:16:19.701
THE COUNSELING THAT GOES ALONG

03:16:19.767 --> 03:16:21.669
WITH THE MEDICATION ASSISTED

03:16:21.736 --> 03:16:22.570
TREATMENT.

03:16:22.637 --> 03:16:24.105
AND THERE'S A STRUCTURAL REASON

03:16:24.172 --> 03:16:25.807
WHY IT DOESN'T EXIST IN THE ROLE

03:16:25.874 --> 03:16:27.275
COUNTY.

03:16:27.342 --> 03:16:29.310
AN OUTPATIENT TREATMENT CENTER

03:16:29.377 --> 03:16:31.312
AND THAT IS THE LICENSE TO GET

03:16:31.379 --> 03:16:33.748
REIMBURSEMENT PROVIDE SERVICES.

03:16:33.815 --> 03:16:35.049
IS A MULTI THOUSAND DOLLAR

03:16:35.116 --> 03:16:36.417
APPLICATION.

03:16:36.484 --> 03:16:38.820
IT'S NOT SUITABLE TO A ONE OR

03:16:38.887 --> 03:16:40.255
TWO PERSON ENTITY.

03:16:40.321 --> 03:16:42.323
PRIVATE PRACTICE.

03:16:42.390 --> 03:16:44.792
SO YOU REALLY CAN'T PROVIDE

03:16:44.859 --> 03:16:46.761
SERVICES TO PEOPLE IN THE DRUG

03:16:46.828 --> 03:16:48.029
MEDI CAL SYSTEM.

03:16:48.096 --> 03:16:49.631
WITHOUT A LICENSE.

03:16:49.697 --> 03:16:51.933
NOBODY PAYS YOU.

03:16:52.000 --> 03:16:53.101
ALSO NO ONE PAYS YOU AS THE

03:16:53.168 --> 03:16:54.936
NEWSPAPER PRACTITIONERS THROUGH

03:16:55.003 --> 03:16:57.338
INSURANCE UNLESS YOUR LICENSE IN

03:16:57.405 --> 03:16:57.872
CALIFORNIA DOESN'T HAVE A

03:16:57.939 --> 03:16:59.073
LICENSE.

03:16:59.140 --> 03:17:00.208
PREDICTION COUNSELORS.

03:17:00.275 --> 03:17:02.343
SO WE COULD KEEP POURING MONEY

03:17:02.410 --> 03:17:05.013
INTO PROVIDING MEDICATION.

03:17:05.079 --> 03:17:08.082
BUT IT'S THE COUNSELORSWHO.

03:17:08.149 --> 03:17:09.450
MEET WITH THE PARENTS.

03:17:09.517 --> 03:17:11.352
WITH THE CLIENT MOTIVATE THEM

03:17:11.419 --> 03:17:12.787
MAKE THEM REALIZE HEY I'VE GOT A

03:17:12.854 --> 03:17:15.190
PROBLEM AND HERE ARE THE WAYS

03:17:15.256 --> 03:17:16.691
YOU CAN ADDRESS THE PROBLEM.

03:17:16.758 --> 03:17:18.426
THEY'RE ALSO CRITICALLY

03:17:18.493 --> 03:17:20.528
NECESSARY TO THE FOLLOW UP TO

03:17:20.595 --> 03:17:23.631
KEEP PEOPLE FROM RELAPSING SO

03:17:23.698 --> 03:17:25.099
OUR MODEL NOW IS.

03:17:25.166 --> 03:17:26.334
GET SO SICK.

03:17:26.401 --> 03:17:27.835
THAT YOU HAVE TO BE

03:17:27.902 --> 03:17:29.737
INSTITUTIONALIZED FOR THIRTY

03:17:29.804 --> 03:17:32.073
DAYS FOUR HOURS FROM YOUR HOME

03:17:32.140 --> 03:17:34.008
AND ANOTHER COUNTY.

03:17:34.075 --> 03:17:35.176
GET OUT OF BEING

03:17:35.243 --> 03:17:37.145
INSTITUTIONALIZED HAVE NO FOLLOW

03:17:37.212 --> 03:17:39.414
UP OR MAYBE SOME MEDICATION YOU

03:17:39.480 --> 03:17:41.082
MIGHT BE MOTIVATED TO USE.

03:17:41.149 --> 03:17:42.350
AND WE EXPECT THAT TO WORK WE

03:17:42.417 --> 03:17:43.751
DON'T DO THIS WITH ANY OTHER

03:17:43.818 --> 03:17:44.819
DISEASE.

03:17:44.886 --> 03:17:47.589
IN CALIFORNIA SO WE'RE WAIT I'M

03:17:47.655 --> 03:17:50.491
THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT I SMALL

03:17:50.558 --> 03:17:52.093
OUTPATIENT PROGRAMS.

03:17:52.160 --> 03:17:53.127
THAT COULD BE DONE.

03:17:53.194 --> 03:17:54.963
IMMEDIATELY IMMEDIATELY THE

03:17:55.029 --> 03:17:56.497

LARGER PROGRAMS.

03:18:04.572 --> 03:18:06.774
AND ALLOW THEM TO DO THIS WORK

03:18:06.841 --> 03:18:09.077
WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE THAT COULD

03:18:09.143 --> 03:18:09.844
HAPPEN.

03:18:09.911 --> 03:18:10.979
AT THE END OF THE SESSION WE CAN

WE NEED TO ENFORCEABLE STANDARDS.

03:22:26.634 --> 03:22:28.536
WE NEED THE STATE GOVERNMENT AND

03:22:28.603 --> 03:22:30.605
THE RESPONSIBLE DEPARTMENTS TO

03:22:30.671 --> 03:22:34.008
