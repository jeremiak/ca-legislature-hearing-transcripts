00:16:08.934 --> 00:16:10.135
SCENARIO HERE THE SHARP

00:16:10.202 --> 00:16:12.171
DOWNTURN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY THAT

WE ARE ALL EXPERIENCING NOW IS

00:16:14.173 --> 00:16:17.142
FOLLOWED BY SOME PERIOD OF TIME

00:16:17.209 --> 00:16:19.011
WE'RE ACTIVITIES. REST

00:16:19.078 --> 00:16:21.747
NATIONALLY IS FOLLOWED BY A

00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:23.248
PRONOUNCED REBOUNDED. EITHER

00:16:23.315 --> 00:16:24.350
LATER THIS YEAR OR EARLY NEXT

00:16:24.416 --> 00:16:26.151
YEAR YOU CAN YOU SHAPE TO THE

00:16:26.218 --> 00:16:28.854
CYCLE. THE NARRATIVE THAT WOULD

00:16:28.921 --> 00:16:30.489
ACCOMPANY THIS SCENARIO. WOULD

00:16:30.556 --> 00:16:32.324
BE THAT BECAUSE THE SHUTDOWN

00:16:32.391 --> 00:16:35.060
WASN'T ACTUALLY AND USE OF

00:16:35.127 --> 00:16:37.963
MEDICAL NECESSITY IS MORE IS

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.131
MORE LIKELY THAT AND WILL BE

00:16:39.198 --> 00:16:42.201
ABLE TO BACK ONCE THE CHILDREN

RECOVERY WOULD HAVE MORE OF AN

00:16:47.172 --> 00:16:48.741
ILL SHAPE. WHERE THE VIRUS IS

00:16:48.807 --> 00:16:50.542
TO DISSIPATE THE DESK PAINTING

00:16:50.609 --> 00:16:51.844
THAT RESTRICTIONS REMAIN IN

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:55.981
PLACE HOUSING ECONOMIC OUTPUT

00:16:56.048 --> 00:16:59.385
TO STAY DEPRESSED FOR LONGER.

00:17:02.287 --> 00:17:03.922
THE WORST CASE. OF COURSE WOULD

00:17:03.989 --> 00:17:06.091
BE IF THE PANDEMIC SEEMED TO

00:17:06.158 --> 00:17:10.162
RECEDE. THE REST WERE LIFTED.

00:17:10.229 --> 00:17:12.831
IN AUGUST SEPTEMBER THE VIRUS

00:17:12.898 --> 00:17:14.933

WE SEE A YOU AND AT ALLOW. THE

00:17:25.344 --> 00:17:27.346
ECONOMIC OUTCOME LIKELY DEPENDS

00:17:27.413 --> 00:17:29.448
TO A LARGE EXTENT ON THE

00:17:29.515 --> 00:17:31.817
EVOLUTION OF THE VIRUS ITSELF.

00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:34.319
THE AMER BASELINE INSPECTION

00:17:34.386 --> 00:17:38.690
SEEMS TO BE THAT THE PANDEMIC

00:17:38.757 --> 00:17:39.758
WILL BEGIN TO RECEIVE SOME

00:17:39.825 --> 00:17:42.928

00:17:45.964 --> 00:17:48.333
SPEAKING HOWEVER WE STILL WON'T

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.203
BE IN THE CLEAR BECAUSE AT THAT

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:52.671
POINT THE NORMAL RECESSIONARY

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:55.674
FACT. OVER REALLY THESE ARE THE

00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:57.409
MAN AND THE INCREASE IN

00:17:57.476 --> 00:17:58.710
HOUSEHOLD SAVINGS BOTH OF WHICH

00:17:58.777 --> 00:18:00.479
ARE COMMON IN THE WAKE OF.

00:18:00.546 --> 00:18:02.481
THESE THIS COURSE OF EVENTS

00:18:02.548 --> 00:18:04.950
WITH. THE NATIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT

00:18:05.017 --> 00:18:06.151
RATE IN THE RANGE OF ANYWHERE

00:18:06.218 --> 00:18:09.988
FROM 923% BY THE FOURTH COOPER

00:18:10.055 --> 00:18:12.057
WITH THE POTENTIAL TO BE HIGHER

00:18:12.124 --> 00:18:14.326
BURKE AND REMAIN HILL EATING

00:18:14.393 --> 00:18:17.796
SOME AFTER. YOU CAN GRADUALLY

00:18:17.863 --> 00:18:19.698
OFFICE SEEM. SOME VERSION OF

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:22.568
THIS. THE US UNEMPLOYMENT RATE

00:18:22.634 --> 00:18:25.170
WOULD STILL BE A 9% AT THE END

00:18:25.237 --> 00:18:26.972
OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TURNING

00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:29.541
TO SPECIFICALLY THE STATE'S

00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:31.410
UNEMPLOYMENT DATA FOR MARCH ARE

00:18:31.477 --> 00:18:34.079
NOT YET AVAILABLE BUT RECENT

00:18:34.146 --> 00:18:36.215
CLAIMS UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIM

00:18:36.281 --> 00:18:38.217
SUGGEST SOMEWHERE BETWEEN

00:18:38.283 --> 00:18:39.618
TWELVE AND THREE. RENDON SAID

00:18:39.685 --> 00:18:44.189
NOW LOST. SO TOUCH ON WHAT THIS

00:18:44.256 --> 00:18:45.324
COULD MEAN FOR SOME OF THE KEY

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.192
SECTORS IN THE STATE. THIRTEEN

00:18:47.259 --> 00:18:50.496
ANY ACCOMMODATIONS AND FOOD

00:18:50.562 --> 00:18:53.298
WHICH INCLUDES RESTAURANTS BARS

00:18:53.365 --> 00:18:55.567
OTHER KINDS OF TRAVEL RELATED

00:18:55.634 --> 00:18:57.436
LEISURE SERVICES AND THIS IS A

00:18:57.503 --> 00:19:01.340
MATTER. THESE FIRMS ACCOUNTING

00:19:01.406 --> 00:19:03.075
FOR A MAJORITY OF THE NATIONAL

00:19:03.141 --> 00:19:05.878
JOB LOSSES THAT WE SIGNED MARCH.

00:19:05.944 --> 00:19:08.413
IN MARCH THEY'RE BEING HIT VERY

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.949
HARD BY THE DROP OFF IN TOURISM.

00:19:11.016 --> 00:19:13.051
AND IS THAT CONSUMERS ARE YOU

00:19:13.118 --> 00:19:15.621
MORE CAUTIOUS GOING FOR THIS

00:19:15.687 --> 00:19:17.022
SECTOR MAY BE SLOW TO RECOVER.

00:19:17.089 --> 00:19:18.690
AND SINCE THERE LOWMARGIN

00:19:18.757 --> 00:19:20.626
BUSINESSES TO BEGIN WITH WE

00:19:20.692 --> 00:19:21.827
COULD SEE AN INCREASE IN

00:19:21.894 --> 00:19:24.329
BANKRUPTCIES AMONG THESE FIRMS

00:19:24.396 --> 00:19:26.765
LATER IN THE YEAR. THERE'S A

00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:28.634
SIMILAR CITY. AMONG RETAILERS

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.303
IN. ESPECIALLY THE BRICK AND

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:33.739
MORTAR STORE FRONTS THEY'RE

00:19:33.805 --> 00:19:35.340
THEY'RE LIKELY TO BE HIT VERY

00:19:35.407 --> 00:19:38.310
HARD AND- WILL RECOVER FOR MANY

00:19:38.377 --> 00:19:39.711
OF THE SAME REASONS AS TO THE

00:19:39.778 --> 00:19:42.147
RESTAURANTS AND BARS HAVE A

00:19:42.214 --> 00:19:43.815
SLIDE FOR EVERY POINT.

00:19:43.882 --> 00:19:45.417
YESTERDAY THE COMMERCE

00:19:45.484 --> 00:19:47.753
DEPARTMENT REPORTED THAT RETAIL

00:19:47.819 --> 00:19:51.890
SALES FELL BY BY- 9% ON A

00:19:51.957 --> 00:19:53.258
SEASONALLY ADJUSTED BASIS IN

00:19:53.325 --> 00:19:56.528
MARCH THAT WAS THE SINGLE. BEST

00:19:56.595 --> 00:19:58.664
ONE MY- AB THAT REPORTED SINCE

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:03.702
AND TRACKING MISSTATED IN.

00:20:03.769 --> 00:20:04.770
NINETY TWO. IN CONSTRUCTION WE

00:20:04.836 --> 00:20:06.705
SEE A SECTOR THAT IS VERY

00:20:06.772 --> 00:20:08.106
SENSITIVE TO ECONOMIC

00:20:08.173 --> 00:20:10.943
CONDITIONS IN ACTIVITY HAS

00:20:11.009 --> 00:20:11.577
ALREADY BEEN IN CONSISTENT OVER

00:20:11.643 --> 00:20:13.812
THE PAST YEAR. WELL AFTER THAT

00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:16.648
I PLANNED PROJECTS WE'RE- BOTH

00:20:16.715 --> 00:20:18.817
THE MAN BEGAN FINANCING FOR NEW

00:20:18.884 --> 00:20:19.618
PROJECTS WILL LIKELY BE

00:20:19.685 --> 00:20:21.787
LIMITED. THE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR

00:20:21.853 --> 00:20:24.623
MAYBE ONE AREA SILVER LINING.

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:26.792
BECAUSE IT COULD BENEFIT FROM

00:20:26.858 --> 00:20:29.995
INCREASED DEMAND. THEN WE SEE

00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:31.163
FOR YOU KNOW TECH DATA

00:20:31.229 --> 00:20:32.898
TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS THAT

00:20:32.965 --> 00:20:34.433
SUPPORT TELECOMMUTING PROMOTE

00:20:34.499 --> 00:20:36.468
EDUCATION. AND THEY ALSO HAVE

00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:38.503
THE ADVANTAGE THAT MANY OF THE

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:41.540
EARNED ALREADY CAN SUPPORT A

00:20:41.607 --> 00:20:43.475
REMOTE WORKING OF COURSE. SH

00:20:43.542 --> 00:20:47.379
SO- WITH THAT I'LL I'LL MENTION

00:20:47.446 --> 00:20:48.347
THE RESPONSE THEY WERE SEEN

00:20:48.413 --> 00:20:53.552
HERE- THE FIRST IS THAT THE-

00:20:53.619 --> 00:20:58.123
USING THE- WE WANTED TO JUST

00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:58.857
MENTION THAT THE FEDERAL

00:20:58.924 --> 00:21:01.193
GOVERNMENT MORE THAN EIGHT. HE

00:21:01.259 --> 00:21:02.894
HE WITH THE FISCAL CAPACITY IN

00:21:02.961 --> 00:21:04.596
THE INSTITUTIONAL WE WAY TO RUN

00:21:04.663 --> 00:21:06.331
DEFICITS WHICH ENABLE IT TO

00:21:06.398 --> 00:21:08.033
REPLACE A MEANINGFUL PORTION OF

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.502
THE AGGREGATE SHORTFALL AND

00:21:10.569 --> 00:21:12.671
THAT WERE SEEN. THE ADEQUACY OF

00:21:12.738 --> 00:21:14.306
THE FEDERAL RESPONSE MAY IN

00:21:14.373 --> 00:21:16.375
FACT PROVE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR

00:21:16.441 --> 00:21:18.243
IN THE CASE OF THE INITIAL

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.480
ECONOMIC. WE SEE. ON THE

00:21:21.546 --> 00:21:23.448
PRESIDENT SIGNED THE CORONA

00:21:23.515 --> 00:21:25.017
VIRUS AID RELIEF AND ECONOMIC

00:21:25.083 --> 00:21:27.586
SECURE ACT THE CHAIRS ACT THE

00:21:27.653 --> 00:21:29.855
PACKAGE WAS HISTORIC BOTH IN

00:21:29.921 --> 00:21:30.989
ITS SIZE IT TWO POINT TWO

00:21:31.056 --> 00:21:33.258
TRILLION WHICH IS EQUAL TO

00:21:33.325 --> 00:21:37.629
AROUND 10% US GDP. ALSO THE

00:21:37.696 --> 00:21:38.463
REPEATEDLY WITH WHICH WAS

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:42.200
ENACTED. JUST WISHING INCLUDED

00:21:42.267 --> 00:21:43.969
SOME POLICIES THAT ARE LIKELY

00:21:44.036 --> 00:21:45.504
TO BE QUITE HELPFUL SUCH AS THE

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:47.873
PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM AND

00:21:47.939 --> 00:21:49.274
EXPANDING UNEMPLOYMENT

00:21:49.341 --> 00:21:52.978
INSURANCE BENEFITS. STILL IT'S

00:21:53.045 --> 00:21:54.746
ALMOST CERTAIN THAT MORE ACTION

00:21:54.813 --> 00:21:57.182
WILL BE NEEDED WELL THE PACKAGE

00:21:57.249 --> 00:21:59.985
PROVIDES SUPPORTS TO

00:22:00.052 --> 00:22:00.919
INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES IT

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:03.822
LEAVES OUR SIGNIFICANTLY

00:22:03.889 --> 00:22:04.990
DELAYED DATE TO CERTAIN

00:22:05.057 --> 00:22:07.693
HORRIBLE DELUSIONS OF SECULAR I

00:22:07.759 --> 00:22:09.361
DON'T THINK THE DOCUMENTED

00:22:09.428 --> 00:22:14.766
RESIDENTS IN I. ABOUT A HUNDRED

00:22:14.833 --> 00:22:16.068
AND FIFTY IN AID STATE AND

00:22:16.134 --> 00:22:18.336
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO SEE THEM

00:22:18.403 --> 00:22:19.671
YEAH WITH THE DIRECT COSTS OF

00:22:19.738 --> 00:22:21.573
RESPONDING TO THE PANDEMIC.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.575
CALIFORNIANS ELIGIBLE TO

00:22:23.642 --> 00:22:24.843
RECEIVE ABOUT FIFTEEN POINT

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:27.212
THREE BILLION THIS WITH SIX OR

00:22:27.279 --> 00:22:28.814
SEVEN BILLION THAT GOING TO

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:32.350
LOCAL. HOWEVER THE SEVERITY OF

00:22:32.417 --> 00:22:34.453
THE DOWNTURN. THERE IS AN

00:22:34.519 --> 00:22:37.222
ARGUMENT THAT MORE MORE AID IS

00:22:37.289 --> 00:22:41.426
NECESSARY AND IN PARTICULAR IF

00:22:41.493 --> 00:22:42.027
THEY CAN BE DELIVERED THROUGH

00:22:42.094 --> 00:22:44.763
THE STATE. THEY ARE GOOD

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:46.298
VEHICLE FOR GETTING ME. IN

00:22:46.364 --> 00:22:48.600
LARGE MONEY AN INMATE IN A

00:22:48.667 --> 00:22:50.969
RELATIVELY QUICK FASHION AND

00:22:51.036 --> 00:22:54.773
I'M- AND I THINK THE GOVERNOR

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:57.642
HAS RECENTLY MADE A REQUEST-

00:22:57.709 --> 00:22:59.111
DISCRETIONARY AID WHICH WOULD

00:22:59.177 --> 00:23:02.881
BE HELPFUL. SO FINALLY MOVING

00:23:02.948 --> 00:23:04.683
TO THE STATE'S FISCAL OUTLOOK

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:08.286
ON THE THIRD SLIDE. AT THIS

00:23:08.353 --> 00:23:10.222
POINT WE THINK IT'S VERY LIKELY

00:23:10.288 --> 00:23:11.523
THAT THE STATE IS GONE FROM AN

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:13.458
ANTICIPATED SURPLUS IN NOW

00:23:13.525 --> 00:23:16.061
FACING LIKELY FACING A BUDGET

00:23:16.128 --> 00:23:17.062
PROBLEM AND POTENTIALLY

00:23:17.129 --> 00:23:19.431
SIGNIFICANT WHAT. UNDER WHEN WE

00:23:19.498 --> 00:23:21.800
SAY BUDGET PROBLEM WE ARE

00:23:21.867 --> 00:23:23.368
REFERRING TO SITUATION WHERE

00:23:23.435 --> 00:23:25.137
THE STATE'S REVENUES PLUS IT'S

00:23:25.203 --> 00:23:27.205
DISCRETIONARY RESERVES ARE

00:23:27.272 --> 00:23:29.107
INSUFFICIENT COVERAGE EXISTING

00:23:29.174 --> 00:23:32.978
SERVICE LEVEL. REALISTICALLY IT

00:23:33.044 --> 00:23:34.246
WILL PROBABLY TAKE SEVERAL

00:23:34.312 --> 00:23:36.915
MONTHS FOR US TO GET A CLEAR

00:23:36.982 --> 00:23:38.583
IDEA OF THE BUDGET SITUATION.

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:40.752
PART OF THIS IS THE NEW TO THE

00:23:40.819 --> 00:23:42.254
INTERNET YOUR DISCOUNT. THE

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.022
DOWNTURN HAS IN CERTAIN IN

00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:46.191
RECENT AND BY OCCURRING IN THE

00:23:46.258 --> 00:23:49.394
SPRING IT MEANS WE ARE

00:23:49.461 --> 00:23:53.064
FINALIZED. IT'S WITH. A SURE.

00:23:53.131 --> 00:23:55.834
MORE TAX FIVE DATE WAS PUSHED

00:23:55.901 --> 00:23:57.669
JULY IN WALL WAS IT APPROACH

00:23:57.736 --> 00:24:00.005
WEIGHT BUY RELIEF TO TACK IT

00:24:00.071 --> 00:24:02.474
DOES COMPLICATE OUR DEDUCTIBLE

00:24:02.541 --> 00:24:06.044
NEIGHBOR LAST YEAR REVENUE S.

00:24:06.111 --> 00:24:08.947
SO YEAH. FOR THE DURATION OF

00:24:09.014 --> 00:24:10.949
THIS DOWNTURN PAST EXPERIENCE

00:24:11.016 --> 00:24:12.918
DOES SUGGEST TO US THE SCHOOL

00:24:12.984 --> 00:24:16.121
TAX WILL BE SEARCHED FOR

00:24:16.188 --> 00:24:17.622
SEVERAL BUDGET CYCLES. AND AS A

00:24:17.689 --> 00:24:19.624
REMINDER THAT GREAT. I THINK WE

00:24:19.691 --> 00:24:22.227
ENDED IN JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND

00:24:22.294 --> 00:24:23.128
NINE BUT THE STATE WAS STILL

00:24:23.195 --> 00:24:25.096
GRAPPLING WITH BUDGET PROBLEMS.

00:24:25.163 --> 00:24:28.633
TWELVE AND THIRTEEN. NOW WE

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:29.801
HAVE INCLUDED RECESSION

00:24:29.868 --> 00:24:30.902
SCENARIOS IN OUR NOVEMBER

00:24:30.969 --> 00:24:33.338
FISCAL OUTLOOK IN RECENT YEARS

00:24:33.405 --> 00:24:37.375
IN THIS PAST YEAR AND IN

00:24:37.442 --> 00:24:38.877
NOVEMBER WE LOOK AT IT WAS SORT

00:24:38.944 --> 00:24:41.446
OF FULLER THIRTY TODAY BRIDGE

00:24:41.513 --> 00:24:42.914
POST WORLD WAR TWO SESSION

00:24:42.981 --> 00:24:44.816
UNDER THESE CAN. WE ESTIMATED

00:24:44.883 --> 00:24:49.855
IN THE FOR YEAR REVENUES WOULD

00:24:49.921 --> 00:24:51.923
BE TO. LAST PRAYER BACK THREE.

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:52.457
BUT THERE'D STILL BE A NOT

00:24:52.524 --> 00:24:53.525
THIRTY BILLION. LOS OVER THE

00:24:53.592 --> 00:24:55.794
NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS SO FOR

00:24:55.861 --> 00:24:58.830
THAT THAT'S FOR A TOTAL OF

00:24:58.897 --> 00:25:00.866
FIFTY BILLION DOLLAR SHORTFALL.

00:25:00.932 --> 00:25:03.034
AND UNFORTUNATELY PRELIMINARY

00:25:03.101 --> 00:25:03.902
INDICATIONS ARE THAT THE

00:25:03.969 --> 00:25:06.238
REVENUE LOSSES IN THE CURRENT

00:25:06.304 --> 00:25:06.905
DOWNTURN COULD BE WORSE IN

00:25:06.972 --> 00:25:09.941
THIS. CENTURY ON A PAR WITH THE

00:25:10.008 --> 00:25:11.776
TYPE OF DOWNTURN WE SAW IN THE

00:25:11.843 --> 00:25:14.312
GREAT RECESSION. THAT WOULD BE

00:25:14.379 --> 00:25:17.549
CONSISTENT WITH A THIRTY FIVE.

00:25:17.616 --> 00:25:18.350
REVENUE SHORTFALL THE FIRST

00:25:18.416 --> 00:25:21.052
YEAR IN. ADDITIONAL EIGHTY FIVE

00:25:21.119 --> 00:25:22.687
BILLION REVENUE SHORTFALL IN

00:25:22.754 --> 00:25:26.424
THE YEARS. AFTER SO THE BUDGET

00:25:26.491 --> 00:25:28.493
PROBLEMS OF THIS MAGNITUDE WERE

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.629
TO EMERGE THEY WOULD EXCEED THE

00:25:30.695 --> 00:25:32.631
STATE'S RESERVES WHICH WE

00:25:32.697 --> 00:25:35.600
ESTIMATOR CURRENTLY AT

00:25:35.667 --> 00:25:37.002
SEVENTEEN AND A HALF BILLION.

00:25:37.068 --> 00:25:38.670
ALL THE STATE. WE ON TRACK THE

00:25:38.737 --> 00:25:40.839
SCHOOL YEAR WITH. RESERVES OF

00:25:40.906 --> 00:25:42.641
ALMOST TWENTY ONE BILLION THIS

00:25:42.707 --> 00:25:44.843
FIGURE- ARRESTED NOT A LOT OF

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:47.779
IT HAS COME DOWN SOMEWHAT SINCE

00:25:47.846 --> 00:25:52.484
THE ONSET OF THE VIRUS AND THE

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.119
STATE'S RESPONSE. THE PROBLEM

00:25:54.185 --> 00:25:56.688
HE LARGE AND WILL LAST LONGER.

WE RECOMMEND THE JUNE YOU OF

00:25:57.989 --> 00:26:02.193

HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT THE

00:26:02.894 --> 00:26:04.729
REVENUE PICTURE WILL BE.

00:26:04.796 --> 00:26:08.166
PRACTICE ONE APPROACH YOU MAY

00:26:08.233 --> 00:26:11.736
WANT TO CONSIDER WOULD BE TO BE

00:26:11.803 --> 00:26:12.170
GET IT'S CUT BUDGET

00:26:12.237 --> 00:26:13.538
CONVERSATION GOING BACK TO

NOTION OF BASELINE. WE NOW MAY

00:26:16.708 --> 00:26:19.678
MAKE IT EASIER TO ADDRESS.

00:26:19.744 --> 00:26:20.278

SUMMER. AND TO ASSIST YOU WITH

00:26:23.281 --> 00:26:24.916
THAT WE'RE SETTING ASIDE MUCH

00:26:24.983 --> 00:26:26.451
OF THE WHAT HAD BEEN UNDER

00:26:26.518 --> 00:26:28.320
CONSIDERATION FROM JANUARY

00:26:28.386 --> 00:26:30.388
THROUGH APRIL TO DEVELOP

00:26:30.455 --> 00:26:32.257
ESTIMATES OF THE BASELINE

00:26:32.324 --> 00:26:34.759

00:26:34.826 --> 00:26:38.830
COULD THINK OF. SURE THIS.

00:26:38.897 --> 00:26:41.800
UPDATING OUR BASELINE BUDGETING.

00:26:41.866 --> 00:26:42.634
WHEN I SAY BASS LINE I MEAN IS

00:26:42.701 --> 00:26:44.769
THE COST OF THE CONCERT.

00:26:44.836 --> 00:26:46.538

THE RECENTLY ENACTED

00:26:53.178 --> 00:26:56.181
LEGISLATION POSSIBLY JUST MEN'S

00:26:56.247 --> 00:27:00.385
NOT JUST. SO AS YOU CAN SEE

00:27:00.452 --> 00:27:02.253
FROM WHAT I JUST SAID THAT THE

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:05.190
CONCEPT OF A BASELINE- WORKLOAD

00:27:05.256 --> 00:27:07.092

00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:25.014
INITIATIVE THAT WAS ENACTED BY

00:56:25.081 --> 00:56:26.483
THE VOTERS NUMBER OF TWENTY

00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:28.451
FOURTEEN. AND BASICALLY THE WAY

00:56:28.518 --> 00:56:31.287
IT WORKS IS THAT. THE FUNDS IN

00:56:31.354 --> 00:56:33.056
THE RAINY DAY FUND AND WE SPEND

00:56:33.123 --> 00:56:36.793
MANDATORY DEPOSITS IN THERE

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:37.961
WHICH IS THE MAJORITY. RENDON

00:56:38.027 --> 00:56:40.296
RAINY DAY SIGNS CANNOT BE. ON

00:56:40.363 --> 00:56:43.099
NUMBER ONE AT THE RISK. MERGING

00:56:43.166 --> 00:56:44.501
YOU WOULD IS DECLARE BY I GOT

00:56:44.567 --> 00:56:46.770
ARTS AND I INCLUDES SOME SWITCH.

00:56:46.836 --> 00:56:49.405
DISASTER PERIL FOREST. IN WHICH

00:56:49.472 --> 00:56:51.941
REVENUES COMING IN ALLOW LEVEL

00:56:52.008 --> 00:56:54.010
THE LAST. FOUR YEARS AND THEN

00:56:54.077 --> 00:56:55.044
THE SECOND THING IS NOT TO

00:56:55.111 --> 00:56:58.248
APPROPRIATE FROM. THE

00:56:58.314 --> 00:56:59.816
LEGISLATURE WOULD ALSO HAVE TO

00:56:59.883 --> 00:57:01.918
TAKE ACT. AND THE THIRTEEN

00:57:01.985 --> 00:57:03.620
THING TO. IS THAT THE

00:57:03.686 --> 00:57:04.954
COMPOSITION TWO INCLUDES A

00:57:05.021 --> 00:57:07.524
PROVISION THAT ONLY HALF OF THE

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:09.793
AVAILABLE SIGNS. IN THE RAINY

00:57:09.859 --> 00:57:12.295
DAY FUNDS CAN BE WITHDRAWN IN A

00:57:12.362 --> 00:57:14.397
GIVEN. YEAR AND HE SAID THAT-

00:57:14.464 --> 00:57:15.732
THE REASON THAT PROVISION

00:57:15.799 --> 00:57:17.333
EXISTS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:20.737
TIME ISN'T SIMPLY AND- ALL FROM

00:57:20.804 --> 00:57:21.838
FISCAL YEAR. AND THEN YOU'RE

00:57:21.905 --> 00:57:23.406
LEFT WITH NOTHING IN THE NEXT

00:57:23.473 --> 00:57:25.408
FISCAL YEAR THE ECONOMIC IMPACT

00:57:25.475 --> 00:57:27.310
OF WHATEVER RECESSION OR CRISIS

00:57:27.377 --> 00:57:28.878
YOU'RE DEALING WITH EXTENDS

00:57:28.945 --> 00:57:30.046
BEYOND THE FIRST THE SCHOOL

00:57:30.113 --> 00:57:31.481
YEAR AND I STAYED WITH THE LA-

00:57:31.548 --> 00:57:33.216
MENTION. THERE'S A VERY STRONG

00:57:33.283 --> 00:57:35.151
POSSIBILITY WITH THIS CRISIS

00:57:35.218 --> 00:57:37.253
THAT WE WILL SEE THE IMPACT NOT

00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:39.255
ONLY IN THE CURRENT YEAR NOT

00:57:39.322 --> 00:57:40.857
ONLY. YOUR AFTER BASS AND

00:57:40.924 --> 00:57:43.960
EIGHTY EVEN HERE. THAT SO- THAT

00:57:44.027 --> 00:57:46.162
IS A- KAPLAN TERMS IS THAT AND

00:57:46.229 --> 00:57:47.964
HOW THAT CAN BE APPROPRIATED-

00:57:48.031 --> 00:57:49.899
BUT THE ACTUAL NOW WILL BE

00:57:49.966 --> 00:57:51.601
BASED ON ACT DISCUSSION.

00:57:51.668 --> 00:57:54.037
RATIONS AND THE LEGISLATURE AND

00:57:54.103 --> 00:57:56.039

01:38:57.631 --> 01:39:00.701
AT THIS POINT. YOU KNOW IT IS

01:39:00.768 --> 01:39:02.736
TRUE THAT THE PROPOSITION TO

01:39:02.803 --> 01:39:06.407
MEASURE HAD SOME TRUE UP IN

01:39:06.473 --> 01:39:09.276
TRUE DOWN PROVISIONS. THAT

01:39:09.343 --> 01:39:10.778
AREN'T MY COLLEAGUES FROM

01:39:10.844 --> 01:39:13.414
PARKER FINANCE MENTIONED. AND

01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:15.449
IT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

01:39:15.516 --> 01:39:17.551
CAPITAL GAINS RELATED TAX

01:39:17.618 --> 01:39:20.854
REVENUES ARE LOWER THAN WHAT WE

01:39:20.921 --> 01:39:22.790
HAD ANTICIPATED AND THE CURRENT

01:39:22.856 --> 01:39:25.459
FISCAL YEAR THERE CAN BE A TRUE

01:39:25.526 --> 01:39:27.861
DOWN. ELEMENT TO IT WHICH WOULD

01:39:27.928 --> 01:39:30.898
MAKE SOME OF THE- FUNDS

01:39:30.964 --> 01:39:32.633
AVAILABLE FOR SPENDING. BUT WE

01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:34.034
DON'T KNOW YET WHAT WHAT THAT

01:39:34.101 --> 01:39:38.539
WILL BE. OUR ABILITY TO

01:39:38.605 --> 01:39:40.307
ESTIMATE THE REVENUES IS

01:39:40.374 --> 01:39:43.177
SIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIRED RIGHT

01:39:43.243 --> 01:39:45.846
NOW ALL BECAUSE OF THE- DELAY

01:39:45.913 --> 01:39:47.981
TAX FILING DATE. AT THE SAME

01:39:48.048 --> 01:39:49.650
TIME WE ALREADY THINK THAT

01:39:49.717 --> 01:39:51.118
THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD

01:39:51.185 --> 01:39:52.886
REVISION THAT IS NECESSARY TO

01:39:52.953 --> 01:39:55.322
THE REVENUES THAT THAT YOU-

01:39:55.389 --> 01:39:57.424
REFERENCED IN THE JANUARY

01:39:57.491 --> 01:39:59.259
BUDGET PROPOSAL. AND AS I WAS

01:39:59.326 --> 01:40:02.329
SAYING IN THE OPENING REMARKS-

01:40:02.396 --> 01:40:03.664
YOU KNOW IF IT WAS A TYPICAL

01:40:03.731 --> 01:40:05.132
RECESSION YOU CAN MAYBE THINK

01:40:05.199 --> 01:40:06.834
ABOUT A TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR

01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:09.203
REDUCTION BUT IN A MORE SEVERE

01:40:09.269 --> 01:40:11.972
RECESSION. THEY CAN TO THE

01:40:12.039 --> 01:40:13.507
GREAT RECESSION THEN YOU YOU

01:40:13.574 --> 01:40:16.410
WOULD INCREASE THAT AMOUNT TO

01:40:16.477 --> 01:40:16.977
SOMETHING AROUND THIRTY FIVE

01:40:17.044 --> 01:40:20.080
BILLION. AND SO FAR THE EARLY

01:40:20.147 --> 01:40:21.749
INDICATIONS ARE THAT THE

01:40:21.815 --> 01:40:23.317
EXPERIENCE THAT WE MIGHT BE

01:40:23.384 --> 01:40:26.019
HAVING NOW IT COULD BE CLOSER

01:40:26.086 --> 01:40:27.254
TO THE GREAT RECESSION

01:40:27.321 --> 01:40:29.690
EXPERIENCE. IN SPEAKER I DO

01:40:29.757 --> 01:40:31.425
THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:40:31.492 --> 01:40:33.193
SHOULD PREPARE FOR FAIRLY

01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:35.629
SUBSTANTIAL DOWNWARD REVISION

01:40:35.696 --> 01:40:38.365
BUT IT JUST WON'T BE. SOMETHING

01:40:38.432 --> 01:40:41.702
THAT WE'RE- ABLE TO. PROVIDE A

01:40:41.769 --> 01:40:44.171
PRECISE ESTIMATE ON PROBABLY

01:40:44.238 --> 01:40:46.707
UNTIL JULY WHEN WE HAD THE TAX

01:40:46.774 --> 01:40:48.342
PAYMENT DATE. MEANS SO FAR

01:40:48.409 --> 01:40:49.943
APRIL IS TYPICALLY ONE OF THE

01:40:50.010 --> 01:40:51.378
MOST IMPORTANT MONTHS OF THE

01:40:51.445 --> 01:40:53.213
YEAR FOR THE STATE'S TAX

01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:54.348
COLLECTION FOR PERSONAL INCOME

01:40:54.415 --> 01:40:56.984
TAX. SO FAR IN THE MIND WE'VE

01:40:57.050 --> 01:40:59.653
HAD MORE TAX REFUNDS PAID OUT

01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:02.122
THEN WE HAVE COLLECTIONS COMING

01:41:02.189 --> 01:41:05.692
IN SO IT TELLS YOU THAT IT'S A

01:41:05.759 --> 01:41:06.560
RADICALLY DIFFERENT KIND OF A

01:41:06.627 --> 01:41:09.930
YEAR. AND SO. YOU KNOW NOT ALL

01:41:09.997 --> 01:41:11.198
OF THAT IS JUST A FUNCTION OF

01:41:11.265 --> 01:41:13.967
TIME EITHER AND- THE

01:41:14.034 --> 01:41:16.670
WITHHOLDING TAX IS UNAFFECTED.

01:41:16.737 --> 01:41:18.605
WITHHOLDING FROM OUR PAYCHECKS

01:41:18.672 --> 01:41:20.407
IS UNAFFECTED BY THE DELAY IN

01:41:20.474 --> 01:41:22.309
THE TAX FILING DATE AND THAT'S

01:41:22.376 --> 01:41:24.578
ALREADY. SHOWING A 10%

01:41:24.645 --> 01:41:27.581
REDUCTION. SO I THINK YOU CAN

01:41:27.648 --> 01:41:29.450
EXPECT TO SEE VERY SUBSTANTIAL

01:41:29.516 --> 01:41:30.918
DOWNWARD REVISIONS TO THE

01:41:30.984 --> 01:41:34.087
REVENUE ESTIMATES. THE BILL

01:41:34.154 --> 01:41:35.556
LATER THIS YEAR. THE NUMBERS IN

01:41:35.622 --> 01:41:38.358
IN MAY IT WILL HAVE PROBABLY

01:41:38.425 --> 01:41:40.961
THE GREATER- UTILITY TO THEM

01:41:41.028 --> 01:41:43.063
AND THEN WE WILL REFINE AND THE

01:41:43.130 --> 01:41:49.636
SUBSEQUENT TWO MONTHS. THANK

01:41:49.703 --> 01:41:55.776

01:41:55.843 --> 01:41:57.778

CONTINUE TO PROVIDE OUR

02:19:16.081 --> 02:19:18.316
ANALYSIS OF HOW WELL THAT NEW

02:19:18.383 --> 02:19:21.519
SYSTEM- IT'S GOING AS NEW

02:19:21.586 --> 02:19:24.422
PROJECTS ARE CONTINUE FORWARD

02:19:24.489 --> 02:19:25.724
IN YEARS TO COME BACK IN THE

02:19:25.790 --> 02:19:28.193
PAST OBSERVATION IF I MADE THE

02:19:28.259 --> 02:19:30.628
MISTAKE AND AGAIN IN YOUR TEAM.

02:19:30.695 --> 02:19:34.632
FINANCE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS

02:19:34.699 --> 02:19:36.067
VERY PROBLEMATIC SITUATION

THE ECONOMY AND OTHER OTHER

02:19:43.074 --> 02:19:46.411

02:19:46.478 --> 02:19:49.180

02:19:54.385 --> 02:19:54.853
THAT USED TO BE A REAL BIG

02:19:54.919 --> 02:19:59.057
ISSUE. NOT MUCH CHANGED OTHER

02:19:59.124 --> 02:20:01.259
THAN ADDING MORE MANDATES. BUT

02:20:01.326 --> 02:20:02.694
I DO BELIEVE IF WE'RE GOING TO

02:20:02.761 --> 02:20:04.696
BE TRULY HELPFUL TO LOCAL

02:20:04.763 --> 02:20:06.097
GOVERNMENT EMPOWERING LOCAL

02:20:06.164 --> 02:20:07.732

SOME OF THE STATE IMPOSED

02:20:09.634 --> 02:20:12.871

YOU SEE HIM MERIT THE UC OF A

02:20:15.907 --> 02:20:17.575
VENUE IN THIS BUDGET WHERE WE

02:20:17.642 --> 02:20:20.745

02:20:38.196 --> 02:20:40.899
SOME ADDITIONAL. RESEARCH ON

02:20:40.965 --> 02:20:42.700

NIELSEN SO I AS YOU KNOW UNDER-

02:20:56.147 --> 02:20:57.982
PROPOSITION ONE A LOCAL

02:20:58.049 --> 02:21:01.286

PERFORM MANDATES THAT THE STATE

02:21:03.321 --> 02:21:04.956
ARE JUST NOT FUN THERE ARE A

02:21:05.023 --> 02:21:06.891
FEW EXCEPTIONS TO THOSE- BUT

02:21:06.958 --> 02:21:08.827
OTHERWISE A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

02:21:08.893 --> 02:21:11.696
ONLY NEED TO BE- PERFORMING.

02:21:11.763 --> 02:21:13.565
BEING MANDATES FOR WHICH THE

02:21:13.631 --> 02:21:15.033
STATE HAS PROVIDED FUNDING THAT

02:21:41.793 --> 02:21:43.027
BUT ARE THERE OTHER SAY THAT

02:21:43.094 --> 02:21:44.829
COULD BE THAT COULD BE-

02:21:44.896 --> 02:21:46.264

02:32:51.762 --> 02:32:54.031
UNDERSTANDING. IS THE CASE-

02:32:54.098 --> 02:32:55.466
CERTAINLY DEPENDS ON TOP. BY

02:32:55.533 --> 02:32:57.535
HOTEL BUT MY UNDERSTANDING BY

02:32:57.601 --> 02:33:00.237
AND LARGE IS THAT THEY ARE

02:33:00.304 --> 02:33:02.406
BEING USED IN THE HEALTH. WE

02:33:02.473 --> 02:33:04.475
MIGHT WANT TO GET SOME.

02:33:04.542 --> 02:33:07.778
CLARIFICATION ONLY BECAUSE- FOR

02:33:07.845 --> 02:33:10.681
EXAMPLE UNITE HERE WHICH IS MY

02:33:10.748 --> 02:33:13.250
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OR- THE-

02:33:13.317 --> 02:33:15.419
UNION THAT REPRESENTS THE

02:33:15.486 --> 02:33:17.354
LARGEST NUMBER OF HOTEL WORKERS

02:33:17.421 --> 02:33:20.491
IN CALIFORNIA. HAS NOT SEEN

02:33:20.558 --> 02:33:23.227
THAT SO WE MAY WANT TO GET SOME

02:33:23.294 --> 02:33:29.733
CLARIFICATION. BY THEN- I WANT

02:33:29.800 --> 02:33:31.168
TO GO BACK TO A QUESTION OR

02:33:31.235 --> 02:33:33.404
POINT THAT- BOB WHITE HOUSE YOU

02:33:33.470 --> 02:33:36.507
MADE ABOUT BE DEBT COLLECTION

02:33:36.574 --> 02:33:39.443
AND I'M NOT SURE. WE OF COURSE

02:33:39.510 --> 02:33:41.445
CAN'T- CONTROL WHATEVER THE

02:33:41.512 --> 02:33:43.614
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES BUT I

02:33:43.681 --> 02:33:45.616
KNOW THAT BOTH THE STATE

02:33:45.683 --> 02:33:46.784
GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL

02:33:46.850 --> 02:33:48.652
GOVERNMENTS WILL OFTEN IF THERE

02:33:48.719 --> 02:33:50.220
IS THE DEBT EITHER FOR FINE

02:33:50.287 --> 02:33:52.256
STRAINS FRACTIONS OR PARKING

02:33:52.323 --> 02:33:54.491
TICKETS AND SUCH. THAT AS SOON

02:33:54.558 --> 02:33:55.659
AS FUNDING COMES INTO A

02:33:55.726 --> 02:33:57.361
PERSON'S BANK ACCOUNT THEY WILL

02:33:57.428 --> 02:33:59.296
OFTEN SHOCKED THAT AND I THINK

02:33:59.363 --> 02:34:02.933
RIGHT NOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE.

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:04.301
THAT IT IS NOT CHAPTER JUST

02:34:04.368 --> 02:34:05.869
BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC

02:34:05.936 --> 02:34:11.442

THAT COURT SYSTEM OF COURSE

02:34:20.985 --> 02:34:22.086
THEY ARE MAKING THEIR DECISIONS

02:34:22.152 --> 02:34:23.587

SOME OF THESE ISSUES- BUT THAT

02:35:20.611 --> 02:35:21.178
THEY THINK THOSE ARE REALLY THE

02:35:21.245 --> 02:35:23.480

QUESTIONS THERE OTHER THAN

02:43:25.862 --> 02:43:26.830
MAKES THE POINT THAT THIS IS

02:43:26.897 --> 02:43:29.266
OUR LARGEST CONGREGATE.

02:43:29.332 --> 02:43:30.901
CONGREGATE POPULATION WITHIN

02:43:30.967 --> 02:43:33.270
THE WHOLE STATE AND THIS LARGE

02:43:33.336 --> 02:43:35.705
CORPORATE POPULATION IS 1100%

02:43:35.772 --> 02:43:38.441
WARDS OF THE STATE. AND WHILE

02:43:38.508 --> 02:43:40.677
THERE ARE AND MANY OWNER

02:43:40.744 --> 02:43:41.778
ABILITIES WITHIN THAT

02:43:41.845 --> 02:43:44.181
POPULATION RIGHT NOW THOSE WHO

02:43:44.247 --> 02:43:46.917
ARE BEING HELD IN THE DORM LIKE

02:43:46.983 --> 02:43:49.486
SETTINGS. ARE THE MOST EXPOSED

02:43:49.553 --> 02:43:52.322
THEY HAVE THE LEAST ABILITY TO.

02:43:52.389 --> 02:43:53.823
TO HAVE THIS SOCIAL DISTANCING

02:43:53.890 --> 02:43:56.159
THAT EVERYONE ELSE IS AND SO

02:43:56.226 --> 02:43:59.229
THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY- THERE'S A

02:43:59.296 --> 02:44:01.598
WHOLE VARIETY OF WAYS THAT. WE

02:44:01.665 --> 02:44:04.701
CAN ADDRESS THAT BUT I. WANTED

02:44:04.768 --> 02:44:06.303
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

02:44:06.369 --> 02:44:08.705
PUTTING THAT- FIRST AND

02:44:08.772 --> 02:44:11.308
FOREMOST SO THAT WE ARE NOT WE

02:44:11.374 --> 02:44:14.644
DO WE DO NOT EXPERIENCED. DEATH

02:44:14.711 --> 02:44:15.378
SO LIKE WE ARE SEEING

02:44:15.445 --> 02:44:17.581
UNFORTUNATELY IN MANY OF OUR

02:44:17.647 --> 02:44:19.950
NURSING FACILITIES AND SENIOR

02:44:20.016 --> 02:44:24.955
SWORDS- BUT IN THAT. WE ARE

02:44:25.021 --> 02:44:26.756
JUST ON THE NATURAL BECAUSE

02:44:26.823 --> 02:44:28.391
PEOPLE ARE PAROLED RELEASING

02:44:28.458 --> 02:44:30.961
FOLKS INTO THE COMMUNITY. AND I

02:44:31.027 --> 02:44:32.829
THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT

02:44:32.896 --> 02:44:35.098
THEY BE TESTED BEFORE RELEASED

02:44:35.165 --> 02:44:38.001
NOT THEN BE HELD LONGER BUT SO

02:44:38.068 --> 02:44:40.136
THAT WE CAN. ENSURE THAT THEY

02:44:40.203 --> 02:44:42.339
CAN BE QUARANTINED SO THAT WE

02:44:42.405 --> 02:44:44.174
ARE NOT TAKING THE SPREAD OF

02:44:44.241 --> 02:44:46.109
POTENTIALLY AN INFECTION IN ONE

02:44:46.176 --> 02:44:48.478
FACILITY INTO THE COMMUNITY. SO

02:44:48.545 --> 02:44:50.447
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WE

02:44:50.513 --> 02:44:53.516
ENSURE THAT EVERYONE BEFORE. WE

02:44:53.583 --> 02:44:55.585
NEED MORE TESTING OVERALL NIKKI

02:44:55.652 --> 02:44:58.455
SO IT IS BUT I KNOW WE NEED IT

02:44:58.521 --> 02:45:01.825
OVERALL EVERYWHERE IN THE

02:45:01.891 --> 02:45:13.937
STATE. IT'S. CHEST X. LEAST.

02:45:14.004 --> 02:45:15.438

AS SENATOR SKINNER TALKED ABOUT

02:45:51.041 --> 02:45:52.742
THE POPULATION CAP WHICH SHOWED

02:45:52.809 --> 02:45:54.077
SHE BELIEVED WAS REALLY I THINK

02:45:54.144 --> 02:45:55.879
IT'S THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS I'M

02:45:55.945 --> 02:45:58.048
NOT SURE- BUT MOST OF MY

02:45:58.114 --> 02:46:00.116
DISTRICT DOESN'T FIT UNDER THAT

02:46:00.183 --> 02:46:00.950
CAP BUT I WAS WONDERING WHAT

02:46:01.017 --> 02:46:02.786
THE ADMINISTRATION PLAN TO DO

02:46:02.852 --> 02:46:04.988
THOSE THAT WERE EITHER THREE OR

02:46:05.055 --> 02:46:07.557
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS YEAH. THE

02:46:07.624 --> 02:46:09.125
STATE'S. THESE ARE FOR FINANCE

02:46:09.192 --> 02:46:10.193
I BELIEVE ALL MY QUESTIONS ARE

02:46:10.260 --> 02:46:14.631
FINANCE. YES I'LL MAKE A COUPLE

02:46:14.698 --> 02:46:16.199
BRIEF POINTS FIRST I THINK I

02:46:16.266 --> 02:46:17.867
REALIZED IN THE CONVERSATION

02:46:17.934 --> 02:46:18.868
WITH SENATOR SKINNER THERE IS

02:46:18.935 --> 02:46:21.471
THAT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND-

02:46:21.538 --> 02:46:22.972
FOR THE SPECIFIC TAX PROGRAM

02:46:23.039 --> 02:46:24.941
BUT THERE'S ALSO AND I'M SURE

02:46:25.008 --> 02:46:26.176
MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN GETTING A

02:46:26.242 --> 02:46:29.312
LOT OF THE TIMING ON THIS. FIVE

02:46:29.379 --> 02:46:30.547
HUNDRED THOUSAND PERSON CASPER

02:46:30.613 --> 02:46:32.248
LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGE FROM THE

02:46:32.315 --> 02:46:34.050
CENTRAL SAXON SO THERE ARE A

02:46:34.117 --> 02:46:35.985
LOT OF CITIES AND OTHER LOCAL

02:46:36.052 --> 02:46:39.289
JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE BELOW

02:46:39.356 --> 02:46:42.792
FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE. THREE

02:46:42.859 --> 02:46:44.928
HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT ARE IN. FOR

02:46:44.994 --> 02:46:46.129
BACK THROUGH A- UNDER THE CAR

02:46:46.196 --> 02:46:48.064
LAW SO THERE'S NO LOT OF

02:46:48.131 --> 02:46:49.866
DISCUSSION AROUND MAKE UP. VERY

02:46:49.933 --> 02:46:53.069
AWARE AND WHAT I'M NOT ON PART

02:46:53.136 --> 02:46:54.137
OF THE NAY. SEVERAL BILLS SO I

02:46:54.204 --> 02:46:55.438
THINK. THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE

02:46:55.505 --> 02:46:56.840
BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:46:56.906 --> 02:46:57.474
THAT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND EACH

02:46:57.540 --> 02:46:59.175
I THINK ON THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE

02:46:59.242 --> 02:47:02.412
WHEN IT COMES TO HOW. THE IS A

02:47:02.479 --> 02:47:03.446
PROGRAM THAT WAS IN LAST BUDGET

02:47:03.513 --> 02:47:04.948
THAT WE NOW. PUT IN SOME THIS

02:47:05.014 --> 02:47:07.884
ADDITIONAL MONEY ON THIS. PART

02:47:07.951 --> 02:47:09.352
OF IT IS THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:47:09.419 --> 02:47:10.720
IN THE BOX BUT THEN THERE'S

02:47:10.787 --> 02:47:13.189
ALSO THE COUNTY SAN MONEY DOES.

02:47:13.256 --> 02:47:14.657
BASED ON THE COUNTY TO ALL THE

02:47:14.724 --> 02:47:16.526
COUNTIES AND INTERACTIONS MEANS

02:47:16.593 --> 02:47:18.361
OF CARE WHICH ALSO COVER ALL

02:47:18.428 --> 02:47:20.130
AREAS OF THE STATE SO. THE

02:47:20.196 --> 02:47:22.732
FOCUS ON THE CITY'S. IS THAT

02:47:22.799 --> 02:47:25.101
SPECIFIC CAR OUT OF THE FUNDING

02:47:25.168 --> 02:47:25.702
IS BASED ON THE UNIQUE

02:47:25.769 --> 02:47:27.504
CHALLENGES THAT THEY FACE

02:47:27.570 --> 02:47:28.538
CERTAINLY NOT THE ONLY PART OF

02:47:28.605 --> 02:47:29.506
THE APPLICATION THAT IS

02:47:29.572 --> 02:47:31.274
DESIGNED TO ADDRESS ISSUES

02:47:31.341 --> 02:47:32.776
ACROSS THE STATE INCLUDING

02:47:32.842 --> 02:47:34.110
PEARL HOMELESSNESS. I THINK THE

02:47:34.177 --> 02:47:36.179
BROADER ISSUE THAT WE KNOW IS

02:47:36.246 --> 02:47:38.348
THAT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS.

02:47:38.415 --> 02:47:44.521
IT'S A GOOD START WE HAVE A LOT.

02:47:44.587 --> 02:47:45.388
MORE TO DO THIS WAS AN ISSUE.

02:47:45.455 --> 02:47:46.456
TO THE STATE. I WON THE BIGGEST

02:47:46.523 --> 02:47:48.725
IN THIS. EVEN BEFORE COMING

02:47:48.792 --> 02:47:49.359
NINETEEN. WE UNDERSTAND OCCURS

02:47:49.426 --> 02:47:50.527
MORE TO THERE AND I THINK THE

02:47:50.593 --> 02:47:52.162
LAST THING I'LL SAY IN ADDITION

02:47:52.228 --> 02:47:53.530
TO THAT. I'M MORE FLEXIBLE

02:47:53.596 --> 02:47:55.398
FEDERAL AID DOT RECEDING AND IT

02:47:55.465 --> 02:47:56.566
DID IN ADDITION TO THE FACT

02:47:56.633 --> 02:47:58.768
THAT. LARGER SEVEN LOCAL

02:47:58.835 --> 02:48:00.804
GOVERNMENTS ARE ENTITLED SHOULD

02:48:00.870 --> 02:48:08.845
BE. THANKS I KNOW THE EMERGENCY

02:48:08.912 --> 02:48:10.814
SOLUTIONS GRANT ARE ONE PART IN

02:48:21.157 --> 02:48:22.859
OROVILLE DAM CRISIS AND WE GOT

02:48:22.926 --> 02:48:25.228
THE CAMPFIRE WE'VE SEEN THOSE-

02:48:25.295 --> 02:48:27.497
NATURAL DISASTERS BUT WE KNOW

02:48:27.564 --> 02:48:28.631
WHICH WAY THE WIND'S BLOWING WE

02:48:28.698 --> 02:48:30.600
KNOW WHICH WAS WATER FLOWING WE

02:48:30.667 --> 02:48:31.968
CAN GET PEOPLE OUT WAY IN THIS

02:48:32.035 --> 02:48:34.437
CASE WE HAVE AN UNPRECEDENTED

02:48:34.504 --> 02:48:36.606
THE- OUTCOME IS GONNA BE

02:48:36.673 --> 02:48:38.107
DIFFERENT AT THE END BECAUSE

02:48:38.174 --> 02:48:40.143
IT'S WE DON'T KNOW THE DATE SO

02:48:40.210 --> 02:48:41.978

MONEY. PAST THEY CAN'T PREDICT

02:52:20.830 --> 02:52:22.765
FASTER AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE

THAT LUXURY IN CALIFORNIA TO BE

02:52:24.367 --> 02:52:26.235
ABLE TO PRINT MONEY WORK WE'RE

02:52:26.302 --> 02:52:26.969
GONNA HAVE SOME SHORTFALL

02:52:27.036 --> 02:52:28.604

STARTED TALK ABOUT THAT PROCESS

02:52:52.795 --> 02:52:55.431
BECAUSE- WE'RE SURE GONNA NEED.

ABSOLUTELY RIGHTON. THE

02:53:02.238 --> 02:53:03.840
DIFFERENCES. BETWEEN WHAT THE

02:53:03.906 --> 02:53:05.108
STATE CAN DO AND THE FEDERAL

02:53:05.174 --> 02:53:06.943
GOVERNMENT CAN DO BECAUSE THE

02:53:07.009 --> 02:53:08.478
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN PRINT

02:53:08.544 --> 02:53:10.680
MONEY. AND THEN THEY CAN ALSO

02:53:10.747 --> 02:53:13.082
RUN YOUR LITERALLY IN THIS CASE

02:53:13.149 --> 02:53:14.617
TRILLION MULTI TRILLION DOLLAR

02:53:14.684 --> 02:53:16.919
DEFICIT SENSE AND- IN OUR CASE.

02:53:16.986 --> 02:53:19.422
THE RAINY DAY FUND MECHANISM

02:53:19.489 --> 02:53:20.156
ALLOWS FOR A LITTLE BIT OF

02:53:20.223 --> 02:53:22.258
COUNTER CYCLICAL POLICY WHERE.

02:53:22.325 --> 02:53:24.494
WE CAN SEND MORE. ON THESE

02:53:24.560 --> 02:53:25.928
ISSUES INCLUDING THOSE THAT

02:53:25.995 --> 02:53:26.896
YOU'RE NOT LINES WHEN THE

02:53:26.963 --> 02:53:28.664
ECONOMY DECLINES BUT ONLY UP TO

02:53:28.731 --> 02:53:30.800
A CERTAIN LEVEL AND YOU'RE NOT

TO DO THE BEST WITH WHAT WE

02:53:38.374 --> 02:53:40.409
HAVE. IS ONE OF THE REASONS

02:53:40.476 --> 02:53:44.680

GOVERNOR'S FOCUSED ON AND I

02:53:51.487 --> 02:53:52.622

MAKING SURE THAT. THOSE FOLKS

02:54:00.830 --> 02:54:02.565
WHO ARE ARTISTS. AND YOU KNOW

02:54:02.632 --> 02:54:03.666
