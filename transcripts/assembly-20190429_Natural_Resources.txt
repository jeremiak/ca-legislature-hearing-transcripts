THOUSAND NINETEEN NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE HEARING -- WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM YET SO WE'RE GONNA START AS A SUB COMMITTEE AND THEN -- TAKE VOTES WHEN WE HAVE MEMBERS. ARE WE DO HAVE OUR FIRST AUTHOR HERE KASHER TASHA BURNER **** BATH -- IS UNDER HER ABOUT YOU WANT TO COME UP AND PRESENT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU SO MUCH COLLEAGUES -- MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO THINK OF THE CHAIR AND HER STAFF. FOR THEIR WORK ON THE SPELL AND I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE MOMENTS WE'VE DISCUSSED AND AGREED UPON. AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE WAS TO SUPPORT OUR STATE SMALL BECAUSE THE CITIES THAT ARE WRESTLING WITH BEST PRACTICES FOR ONLINE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL COMPANIES. THE AMENDMENTS WE'VE ACCEPTED OR TO CLARIFY THAT THE BILL ONLY APPLIES O RESIDENTIAL AREAS SO NO AREAS ZONED FOR RESIDENTIAL TOURISM WILL BE SUBJECT TO THIS REQUIREMENT WHICH I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT TO SOME OF OUR LOCAL CITIES. ELIMINATES REFERENCES TO THE COAST -- ACCOMMODATIONS PROGRAM AS SHORT TERM RENTALS DO NOT FALL UNDER THAT PROGRAMS PURVIEW. AND IT CREATES A REVIEW MECHANISM BY THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH. IN THE MIDST OF CALIFORNIA STATE WHAT HOUSING CRISIS THE HOUSING SHORTAGE IS OF PARTICULAR PARTICULARLY ACUTE IN THE COASTAL ZONE. CITIES FACED COMPOUNDED BARRIERS TO REGULATING SHORT TERM RENTALS WHEN SEEKING TO MINIMIZE OUR VAN THE NUMBER OF THESE RENTALS AND RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS. THE RECENT SPIKE OF SHORT TERM RENTALS OF RESIDENTIAL UNITS REDUCES THE AVAIL THE AVAILABILITY. OF ALREADY SCARCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND MANY COSTA COMMITTEES. ANY UNIT REMOVE FROM OURS OWNS HOUSING STOCK IS DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO REPLACE. CITIES IN CALIFORNIA NATIONWIDE HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING TO STRIKE A BALANCE TO REGULATE ONLINE VACATION RENTALS. FOR ALMOST A DECADE SHORT TERM PLATFORMS AND THEIR OWN TELLING HAVE BEEN. A RESOURCE FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS AN EXTRA SOURCE OF INCOME FOR FAMILIES IN NEED OF AN ECONOMIC BOOST. HOWEVER THERE IS A SHIFT IN THE INDUSTRY THAT'S PROVING DETRIMENTAL TO SMALL RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITIES WERE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS ALREADY CHALLENGING DEFINE WE SEE THIS EVERY DAY AND MY COMMUNITIES AND NORTH COUNTY SAN DIEGO. FOR A BUT ALSO FROM I'D BE ALL THE WAY UP TO CARLSBAD. AND I THINK A OF VERY PERTINENT EXAMPLE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THAT AND MARKET IN COASTAL CITIES. IS AN IMPAIR IMPERIAL BEACH THEY PUT IN A HOT TWO HUNDRED UNIT -- PROJECT TO ADD MORE HOUSING TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT -- TOOK A LOT OF POLITICAL WELL AS IT ALWAYS DOES AND CLOSE THE CITY SO IT'S A BILL MORE HOUSING THEY DID IT. AND TWENTY FIVE YOUR TWENTY FIVE OF THOSE UNITS ARE ALREADY FULL TIME SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS IT'S AN EIGHTH OF THE UNIT'S. INTENDED FOR FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT WILL NOT BE AFFORDABLE HOUSING NOW -- AND SO IN THE DECADE SINCE THE POPULARIZATION OF THE ONLINE HOME SHARING INDUSTRY SAN DIEGO'S INVENTORY OF SHORT TERM RENTALS HAS GROWN TO MORE THAN. ELEVEN THOUSAND THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE ENTIRE HOMES THAT ARE BEING WRENCHED OUT FOR SHORT TERM STAYS. SHORT TERM RENTALS OF CREATING NEXUS BETWEEN TOURISM HOUSING THAT IN AREAS OUR EXPERIENCE THEM UP EXPERIENCING THE MOST PROFOUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING CHALLENGES HURTS RENTERS WE KNOW WHEN YOU REMOVE HOUSING FROM THE HOUSING STOCK. IT INCREASES RENTAL PRICES AND YOU'RE SEEING PEOPLE NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND A PLACE TO RENT IN OUR COASTAL ZONE IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. UCLA ANDERSON SCHOOL OF BUSINESS CONSIDERS LA'S HIGH COST OF HOUSING A SIGNIFICANT DRAG ON JOB CREATION. THE NEARLY TEN THOUSAND UNITS TAKEN OFF THE RENTAL MARKET BY SHORT TERM RENTAL PROPERTY PLATFORMS IS EQUIVALENT TO SEVEN YEARS OF A HORDE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION. SO I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT I I WANT TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU IS IS TO SAY. THIS IS A SEVERE PROBLEM AND IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT WE ARE IN YOU KNOW WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BUILD OURSELVES OUT OF THIS CRISIS BUT WE CERTAINLY WON'T BUILD OURSELVES OUT OF THE CRISIS WHEN WERE BLEEDING AWAY UNITS TO SHOW THE SHORT TERM FATE. PERMANENT SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS. IN VENICE AS MANY AS 12% OF ALL HOUSING UNITS HAVE BECOME AIRBNB UNITS WITHOUT PUBLIC APPROVAL ON THAT EQUATES. TO THREE HUNDRED SIXTY SAU SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL UNITS PER SQUARE MILE. AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE COMBATS THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF SHORT TERM RENTAL PLATFORMS AND WE GIVE CALIFORNIA SMALL BECAUSE THE CITY'S. COMMONSENSE TOOLS TO HELP INSURE ONLINE MENTAL PLATFORMS ARE OPERATING THE WAY THEY WERE INTENDED THAT MEANS FOR HOME SHARING. WHILE PRESERVING ACCESS TO THE COAST FOR SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS FOR PRIMARY RESIDENCE AS SPECIFIED SO THE BILL. CLEARLY IF THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE IS ON SITE THEY DO NOT FALL UNDER THE PURVIEW OF THIS BILL. IF THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE IS NOT ON SITE THEY CAN. RENT OVER ONE OF THE ARE THE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL PLATFORM CAN RENT THAT UNIT FOR UP TO THIRTY DAYS PER PLATFORM SO IT'S A TOTAL OF ABOUT NINETY DAYS PER YEAR -- AND THIS BILL WOULD ALSO IMPORTANTLY REQUIRE THE HOUSING PLATFORM FACILITATOR OF THE SHORT TERM RENTAL TO COLLECT THE SAME. TO YOUR TO TAX THAT HOTELS ARE REQUIRED TO COLLECT TO ENSURE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE FAIRLY COMPENSATED. FOR THE INCREASE PUBLIC SERVICE COSTS AND FOR A CORD BY SERVING TAURUS. OUR STATE HOUSING GOALS TO PROVIDE THREE POINT FIVE MILLION ADDITIONAL HOUSING IN ON THE MARKET BY. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE HOWEVER HOUSING IS THE RENT ON A SHIP PERMANENT SHORT TERM BASIS. LESS THAN THIRTY DAYS A YEAR OUR THIRTY LEARN THIRTY DAYS AT A TIME FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR DEAR. BY DEFINITION REMOVES HOUSING FROM OUR HOUSING HOUSING STOCK OFTEN PERMANENTLY WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS WE DO NOT HAVE A SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL PRICE CRISIS IN THE STATE. SO I ALTHOUGH THIS LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE TOOLS FOR SMALL COASTAL CITIES EMPOWER SHORT TERM RENTAL PLATFORMS TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE AS THEY INTENDED TO DO. AND DID DID TEAR THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF REMOVING HOUSING FROM HOUSING STOCK AT THE EXPENSE OF THE STATE COMMUNITIES STRUGGLING TO GET BY. AND PROVIDE HOUSING FOR THEIR RENTERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE TODAY I HAVE WITH ME TO WITNESSES DEAL CARLSON FOUNDER SHARE BETTER. ASSTAFF AND CONSULTED ON THE HOUSING PULSES WITH A NUMBER OF LABOR AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS JOHN CALLED WILL OF CALIFORNIA HOTEL AND LODGING ASSOCIATION ALL TURNED OVER TO THEM. THANK GOD I'M GONNA GIVE THE WITNESSES AND IN FAVOR OF THE BILL IN THE WITNESSES WHO OPPOSE THE BILL EIGHT MINUTES TOTAL SO YOU CAN DIVIDE THAT UP HOWEVER YOU'D LIKE. VERY WELL THANK YOU. I AM BILL CARLSON I'M CO FOUNDER OF SHARE BETTER SF. THE COALITION OF A RATHER DISPARATE INTERESTS -- MY COALITION REPRESENTS AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS. TEN ORGANIZATIONS LANDLORD ASSOCIATIONS HOTELS THE HOTEL WORKERS UNION. AND NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS FROM BOTH THE EAST AND WEST SIDES OF SAN FRANCISCO. AND IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT SAN FRANCISCO POLITICS IT'S PRETTY DIFFICULT TO GET ALL THOSE PARTIES TOGETHER ON ONE ISSUE. THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF AIRBNB IT BRINGS TOGETHER VERY DISPARATE ELEMENTS. WE'VE BEEN WORKING SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN TO REIN IN THE PROLIFERATION OF SHORT TERM RENTALS. IN SAN FRANCISCO WHEN I BEGAN THIS EXERCISE. THERE WERE THIRTEEN THOUSAND LISTINGS ON THE TOP THREE PLATFORMS ALONE AND WE HAD SIXTY WEBSITES OFFERING SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL RENTALS TO TOURISTS. A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WE'VE LEARNED ONE PLATFORM ACCOUNTABILITY IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. LEFT TO THEIR OWN DEVICES AIRBNB THE RPO HOME AWAY WILL RENT ANYTHING. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT IT'S REGISTERED REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT IT'S LEGAL. WITH OR WITHOUT AN OWNER'S. PERMISSION AND EVEN OVER AN OWNER'S EXPLICIT OBJECTIONS. SO PLATFORM ACCOUNTABILITY BECOME CENTRAL. TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ANY REGULATION WHEN WE ADOPTED IN IN IN SAN FRANCISCO. THE NUMBER OF AIRBNB OPERATORS IN THE CITY DROPPED. FROM EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED TO LESS THAN. FOURTEEN HUNDRED I WANT TO TALK SECOND ABOUT TERM. AND THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS THAT ARE OFTEN ASCRIBED TO SHORT TERM RENTALS. EVERY INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS OF BEEN UNDERTAKEN IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS HAS FOUND THE SAME THING. THEIR OVER INFLATED. I WATCH THIS MORNING AS THE CO FOUNDER OF AIRBNB BRAG THAT HIS COMPANY HAD -- COLLECTED AND REMITTED A BILLION DOLLARS IN HOTEL TAXES IN THE PAST TEN YEARS TWO FIVE HUNDRED AMERICAN CITIES A BILLION DOLLARS. THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY. UNTIL YOU CONSIDER THAT SAN FRANCISCO HOTELS ALONE. GENERATE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR. JUST IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO. THE SHORT TERMINAL PLATFORMS LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF SPENDING THAT THERE ARE CUSTOMERS -- THE MONEY THAT THE CUSTOMER SPENDING IN IN CITIES THANKS TO SHORT TERM RENTALS. BUT AGAIN THE SURVEYS FIND THAT ONLY 224% OF THOSE DOLLARS ARE NEW DOLLARS. THERE'S A DOLLARS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SPENT ABSENT THE SHORT TERM RENTALS THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SPENT BY PEOPLE STAYING IN HOTELS AND BED AND BREAKFASTS AND MOTELS. AND TRADITIONAL TOURIST ACCOMMODATIONS. SAN FRANCISCO'S CHIEF ECONOMIST WHEN WE FIRST STARTED LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE. DETERMINED THAT FOR EVERY UNIT. CONVERTED TO A FULL TIME SHORT TERM RENTAL. EVERY UNIT COST THE CITY IN LOST ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. TOURISTS DON'T SPEND THE WAY RESIDENTS SPENT. DOORS DON'T GET THEIR HAIR CUT THEY DON'T GO TO THE HARDWARE STORE THEY DON'T. GO TO THE DRY CLEANERS THEY DON'T SUPPORT THE NEIGHBORHOOD SERVING BUSINESSES THAT MAKE A NEIGHBORHOOD A NEIGHBORHOOD. AND AND AND THOSE NEIGHBORHOOD SERVING BUSINESSES ARE DOUBLY IMPACTED. WHEN HOUSING BECOMES LESS AVAILABLE AND LESS AFFORDABLE FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES? IF I CAME TO YOU. IF ANYONE CAME TO YOU AND PROPOSED DEMOLISHING. FOURTEEN THOUSAND UNITS OF HOUSING. IN CITIES IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY COASTAL CITIES IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND NOT REPLACING THEM. YOU THINK I WAS NUTS. THEN I WOULD BE. BUT THAT'S EFFECTIVELY WHAT'S HAPPENED. THE NUMBER OF SHORT TERM RENTALS IN SAN DIEGO IS GROWING. A RATHER DRAMATIC PACE IT'S UP AND WILL CONTINUE TO GROW. UNLESS SOMETHING IS DONE TO REIN IN IN. THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY IS WORKING OVERTIME. TO FIND WAYS TO ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING. AFFORDABLE HOUSING [inaudible] IN CALIFORNIA. YOU OUGHT TO BE WORKING EQUALLY HARD TO PRESERVE THE HOUSING THAT WE ALREADY HAVE. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON UP JOHN CALDWELL BEHALF CALIFORNIA HOTEL LODGING ASSOCIATION JUST A LITTLE BIT BACK ON THE ISSUE WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE. WHEN MOST PEOPLE THINK OF AIRBNB OR SHORT TERM RENTALS -- THEY THINK OF HOME SHARING THE COUPLE THAT RETIRED COUPLE WHO LET OUT THEIR HOUSE EVERY SO OFTEN TO EARN SOME SIDE MONEY WE HEAR THAT STORY ALL THE TIME. HOME SHARING IS NOT THE PROBLEM NOT TO US NOT TO THE AUTHOR. THE PROBLEM IS WHAT THE NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL ONCE CALLED COMMERCIAL USERS. A FEW YEARS AGO WE GOT THE RECORDS OF AIRBNB IN NEW YORK CITY HE FOUND THAT DISPROPORTIONATE. SHARE OF THE UNITS WERE OWNED BY COMMERCIAL USERS HE FOUND THAT FOR EXAMPLE TWELVE POSTPONED EIGHT HUNDRED UNITS AND ACCOUNTED FOR TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN RENT IN ONE YEAR -- THAT WAS TWENTY FOURTEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO STUDY BY AIR DE ANY ERROR DNA WHICH IS TRACK SERBIAN BEES -- LISTINGS AND REVENUE FOUND THAT ONLY 25%. OF AIRBNB IS REVENUE IN NEW YORK AND SAN FRANCISCO COMES FROM HOME SHARING. IN IN LA IT'S 19% THE OTHER 81% IS COMMERCIAL. SO THE ISSUE HERE IS NOT HOME SHARING AND TAKING AWAY PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO PLAN OUT THEIR WHOLE HOUSE EVERY SO OFTEN. THE PROBLEM WITH THESE COMMERCIAL USERS ARE. THEY THEY PRESENT A BUNCH OF PROBLEMS BILL ONE IS THERE CREATING WHAT I'M AMOUNTS TO ILLEGAL HOTELS. AND IS CLEARLY HAVING A NEGATIVE INCOME IMPACT ON ON HOUSING -- APARTMENTS -- APARTMENTS AND HOMES ARE BEING TAKEN OFF THE LONG TERM RENTAL MARKET -- A UNITE HERE OFFICIAL TOLD ME. THAT HOTEL EMPLOYEES ALL OVER THE STATE ARE FINDING THEY HAVE. TO MOVE FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM THEIR JOBS. JUST BECAUSE FORMALLY AFFORDABLE HOMES AND APARTMENTS ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE -- THEN THERE'S WE TALKED ABOUT THE THE THE PROVISION TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LOCAL TRANSIT OCCUPANCY TAXES ARE PAID. NOW T. O. T. IS FOR THOSE FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT NO IT'S ONE OF THE FEW REVENUE STREAMS THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. HAVE WITHOUT LIMITS. SHORT TERM RENTALS SHOULD PAY THAT TAX THEY DON'T -- THAT PUTS LEGITIMATE HOTELS AND BED AND BREAKFAST -- AT A SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE FOR EXAMPLE AND THE CHAIRS TOWN OF HOMETOWN OF GLENDALE -- THEY'LL TEAR 212% -- SO ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL TO COST 12% MORE TO STAY AT A HOTEL IN BED AND BREAKFAST. IT ALSO DENIES CITIES AND COUNTIES A LOT OF NEEDED REVENUE WHICH IS WHAT WHY THIS BILL MANDATES THAT THE PLATFORM COLLECT. IN A CLICK THE T. O. T. THAT IT'S OWED. NOT AIRBNB SAYS THEY HAVE NUMEROUS CONTRACTS TO CITIES ALL OVER THE STATE WHICH THEY COLLECT THE T. O. T. FOR THEIR HOSTS BUT THEY WILL ONLY DO THAT UNDER THE THEIR CONDITIONS THEY'LL NEVER TELL YOU THIS. THE CITY OR THE COUNTY WHERE THE RENTAL UNITS ARE LOCATED WHO OWNS THEM OR HOW MANY NIGHTS THEY WERE OCCUPIED HERE BE JUST SENSE THE CITY COUNTY A CHECK AND SAYS TRUST ME. IF THE CITY WANTED ME TO THOSE CONDITIONS THEY WILL GET THE TOT. BED AND BREAKFAST AND HOTELS IN EVERY CITY ND THE COUNTY AND COUNTY IN THE STATE ON THE OTHER HAND ARE REGULARLY AUDITED TO DETERMINE THE EXACT AMOUNT OF TOT OWED. SO THIS BILL LIMITS NOT BANDS SHORT TERM RENTALS BY COMMERCIAL HOSTS IN ONE COUNTY IN THE COASTAL ZONE FOR A FEW YEARS. AND IT SHOULD BE ADDED THAT THE AUTHORS WRITTEN THE BILL SO IT WILL NOT IMPACT THOSE WHO JUST SHARE THEIR OWN HOMES. WE'RE CHEN AYE VOTE [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY OTHER -- MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO WANTS TO USE A VOICE OR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. PLEASE STEP FORWARD AND JUST NAME AND AFFILIATION OF ANY WHETHER OR NOT YOU SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON DEBORAH KERR THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. SIR FLOCKS CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION IN SUPPORT. MATT BROUGHT FOR YOU KNOW HERE IN TEAMSTERS IN SUPPORT. SEAN DRAKE WITH THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION THE COMMISSION DOES NOT HAVE A POSITION BUT I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR INCLUDING US IN THE CONVERSATIONS ON THESE ISSUES. Q. ANYWAY THIS IS AN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME UP TO THE TABLE. AND AGAIN I WILL GIVE THE CONTENTS ARE EIGHT COMBINED MINUTES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY. MY NAME IS JOHN A MECHANIC ON THE PRESIDENT SHARE SAN DIEGO WHICH IS A GROUP OF HUNDREDS OF POSTS. HOMEOWNERS AND PROPERTY MANAGERS THROUGHOUT SAN DIEGO. WHO RELY ON VACATION RENTALS TO MAKE ENDS MEET? WELL BEFORE THE INTERNET. FAMILIES BEEN RENTING HOMES ON THE BEACH TO ENJOY THEIR VACATIONS IN A PRIVATE SPACE THAT ALLOWS AN AFFORDABLE WAY FOR ENTIRE FAMILY TO GET TOGETHER. AND MAKE MEMORIES. THE TWO MET THE TWO TO THREE MINUTES I HAVE TODAY. ALLOWS ME TO SCRATCH THE SURFACE AS TO WHY AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE WOULD ESSENTIALLY BANNED THESE TYPES OF RENTALS AND SAN DIEGO. BUT I WILL DO MY BEST. FOR YEARS SHARE SAN DIEGO HAS WORKED CLOSELY WITH OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AN EFFORT TO CREATE NOORDIN'S ELIMINATES A BAD ACTORS FROM THE SHARING ECONOMY WHILE PROTECTING THOSE A PLAY BY THE RULES. ALLOW THE USE AND STOP THE ABUSE HAS BEEN A PHRASE THAT HAS BEEN USED TIME TIME AGAIN. AB SEVEN THIRTY THIRTY ONE DOES THE EXACT OPPOSITE. IT TARGETS A PLATFORM TO DO FOLLOW THE RULES AND ENHANCES THE PLATFORMS THAT FOSTER THE BAD ACTORS. LET ME FURTHER EXPLAIN. IN CITIES AND COUNTIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY PLATFORMS LIKE AIRBNB HOMEAWAY ENVY RPO WORK WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS AND HOMEOWNERS TO HELP CRAFT REGULATION. THAT MEETS LOCAL NEEDS IN MANY CASES PLATFORMS ENDORSED SIGNIFICANT LIMITS ON SHORT TERM RENTALS THESE ARE THE GOOD ACTORS. LIMITING THE EXPOSURE THESE PLATFORMS CAN HAVE TO JUST THIRTY DAYS EACH DOES NOTHING POSITIVE AND ONLY ENCOURAGES HOST TO LIST ON COUNTLESS OTHER PLATFORMS THAT ARE UNMONITORED. UNREGULATED AND DO NOT COLLECT NOR PAY CITY TAXES. IF AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE WERE TO PASS IT WOULD END UP COSTING CITIES HUNDREDS OF MILLION DOLLARS OF LOST TAX REVENUE. AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE DOES EXACTLY OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOWARDS FOR YEARS IT DISCOURAGES HOSTS FROM USING RESPONSIBLE PLATFORMS AND PUSHES THEM TOWARDS THE IRRESPONSIBLE. ON MANNERED SHE'S ME UNMONITORED AND UNENFORCEABLE PLATFORMS. SECONDLY IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS BILL FOCUSES ON SEVERELY RESTRICTING IF NOT COMPLETELY ELIMINATING ANY HOME FROM SHORT TERM RENTAL INVENTORY THAT IS NOT A PRIMARY RESIDENCE. I RESPECTFULLY CHALLENGE THOSE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL TO ADVISE US WHAT THIS ACTUALLY MEANS. HAS ANY RESEARCH BEEN DONE OR ANY DATA COLLECTED. REGARDING HOW MANY HOMES WOULD BE ELIMINATED AS A RESULT. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE CURRENT SHORT TERM RENTAL INVENTORY WOULD QUALIFY AS A PRIMARY RESIDENCE AND WHAT PERCENTAGE AS A SECONDARY HOME? WITH THIS BILL I'M AT 85% OF THE INVENTORY OR 95% OF THE INVENTORY. ABOUT HOTEL OCCUPANCY EXCUSE ME OCCUPANCY IN SAN DIEGO WHAT IS THE OCCUPANCY RATE AND WHAT IS THE VACANCY RATE. IF X. AMOUNT OF HOMES WERE ELIMINATED SHORT TERM RENTALS WOULD THERE EVEN BE ENOUGH HOTEL ROOMS TO PROVIDE ACCOMMODATIONS TO TOURISTS TO OUR BEACHES AND BASS. IF THIS THAT IS NOT KNOWN IN THE AFFECTED THIS BILL WOULD HAVE ON AVAILABILITY TO OUR VISITORS IS ALSO UNKNOWN AND US IN DIRECT CONFLICT OF THE CALIFORNIA COAST SELECT WHICH SPECIFICALLY FOCUSES ON PRESERVING AND PROTECTING. LOW COST VISITORS ACCOMMODATION ACROSS OUR BEACHES AND BASS. I HEAR FROM I GUESS ALL THE TIME HOW THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD A BEACH VACATION IF THEY HAD TO RENT MULTIPLE HOTEL ROOMS. TO FIT THEIR FAMILIES OF HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS PER NIGHT. SHORT TERM RENTALS PROVIDE AN AFFORDABLE OPTION FOR PEOPLE TO VISIT THE BEACH AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE PROTECT THAT RIGHT. OUR LOCAL ECONOMY WOULD BE HUGELY IMPACTED IF A BILL LIKE THIS PASTLOCAL BUSINESSES IN OUR COMMUNITY BENEFIT FROM SHORT TERM RENTALS AS WE PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR LOCAL RENTAL COMPANIES. RESTAURANTS IN ACTIVITY OPERATORS FOR GUESTS THROUGHOUT THEIR STAY. HELPING TO ENSURE ALL OF SAN DIEGO BENEFITS FROM OUR VISITORS. IF AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE WERE TO PASS MANY BEDS BUSINESSES WOULD SUFFER. INSTEAD OF BANNING VACATION RENTALS AND LIMITING ACCESS TO CALIFORNIA BEACHES WE SHOULD EMBRACE SHORT TERM RENTALS AS LOW COST ACCOMMODATION OPTIONS. IN DOING SO WE PROTECT PRESERVE ACCESS TO THE COAST AND PROTECT PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS TAXPAYERS AND THE COMMUNITY. UNFORTUNATELY AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE IS NOT THE ANSWER. AS A VOTER IRISH OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. I UNDERSTAND THIS IS A COMPLICATED ISSUE I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS INDUSTRY IN SAN DIEGO FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS IF THERE ANY QUESTIONS I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO ANSWER. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRED MEMBERS KAMALA WAGNER REPRESENTING HIGHLIGHT OUR CONCERNS WITH THE BILL. FIRST EVEN IN ITS AMENDED FORM WE REMAIN VERY CONCERNED THAT SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE WILL RESTRICT ACCESS TO THE CODES FOR INDIVIDUALS LOOKING FOR AFFORDABLE ACCOMMODATIONS WHEN TRAVELING WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY. THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY UCLA AND THE COASTAL COMMISSION FOUND THAT AFFORDABLE OVERNIGHT ACCOMMODATIONS IS ONE OF THE MAIN BARRIERS FOR VISITING THE COAST. APPROXIMATELY 75% OF UCLA SURVEY PARTICIPANTS CITED THIS CONCERN WITH A HIGHER RATE OF LATINO VOTERS AND FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN CITING THIS AS A BIG PROBLEM. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE AVERAGE NIGHTLY PRICE PAID FOR AIRBNB RENTALS WAS NINETY FIVE DOLLARS PER PERSON WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY TWENTY DOLLARS LOWER THAN THE AVERAGE RATE IN THE COASTAL ZONE. AND THIRTY DOLLARS LOWER DURING THE SUMMER SEASON PER PERSON. THIS BILL BY ALLOWING CITIES TO PUT EVEN STRICTER LIMITS IN PLACE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY LEAD TO LESS ACCESS BY THESE FAMILIES TO THE COAST. SECOND THE BILL PUTS HOSTING PLATFORMS IN THE MIDDLE OF TENANT AND PROPERTY OWNER AGREEMENTS BY REQUIRING PLATFORMS TO VERIFY THAT A TENANT HAS PERMISSION BEFORE LISTING THEIR HOME. THIS IS UNTENABLE AND COMPLETELY UNWORKABLE CONSIDERING THAT SOME PROPERTY OWNERS MAY BE LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE STATE AND OFTENTIMES OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY. WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THESE AGREEMENT SHOULD REMAIN BETWEEN A TENANT AND AN OWNER. THIRD AIRBNB AS WAS STATED HAS NEGOTIATED -- VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH SEVERAL CITIES IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY TO COLLECT DOT JUST RECENTLY INCLUDING WITH THE CITY OF OCEANSIDE. AND LET ME POINT OUT THAT ALL CONTRACTS NEGOTIATED -- FOR TOT COLLECTION ALLOW FOR AUDITS BY THE CITY. THIS BILL WILL LIKELY REDUCE THE REVENUE THAT SOME OF THE CITIES ARE ALREADY RECEIVING ESPECIALLY IF THE CITY NOW ALLOWS MORE DAYS FOR VACATION HOMES TO BE RENTED. THAN WHAT THE BILL WOULD ALLOW. LASTLY WE WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE EXISTING LOCAL PROCESS CAN WORK HAS WORKED AND IS WORKING. SOME LOCAL ORDINANCES WERE APPROVED UPON INITIAL COASTAL COMMISSION REVIEW AND SOME MORE AMENDED BECAUSE THE COASTAL COMMISSION ARGUED THAT NOT ENOUGH ACCESS WAS BEING PROVIDED. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE CRAFTED ORDINANCES THAT REFLECT THEIR COMMUNITIES AND WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS SIMPLY UNNECESSARY. WE ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO TESTIFY OR TO VOICE THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. MY NAME IS NANCY KRAMER I'VE BEEN IN THE VACATION RENTAL AGENCY BUSINESS FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS AND I FLEW ALL THE WAY HERE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I VEHEMENTLY OPPOSE. AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON KEREN MEMBERS HEALY GOVERNOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU TO READ ON THE A SHORT TERM RENTER OWNER OF A PROPERTY IN SAN DIEGO AND I OPPOSE THIS BILL THIS DOES NOTHING TO PROTECT THE COASTLINE. JUST PROTECTS WHO HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT IT. OKAY ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO VOICE THEIR OPINION ABOUT THE BILL. OKAY SING NOT I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA. YES IF IF I COULD. IF IF THE AUTHOR COULD. IF EXPLAIN TO BE THE LOCAL PROCESS AND WHY THAT INSUFFICIENT AND AND STILL DOES YOUR PROPOSING THE BILL. SURE THIS BILL ACTUALLY MAINTAINS LOCAL CONTROL -- IN THE ISSUE OF THE FACT THAT -- FULL TIME SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS ARE REMOVING HOUSING FROM OUR HOUSING MARKET AND WE HAVE DETERMINED AS A LEGISLATURE THAT THE HOUSING PRICES OF STATEWIDE IMPORTANCE IMPORTANCE. AND SO IN ADDRESSING THAT AND SAN DIEGO COUNTY -- THIS BILL WOULD ABSOLUTELY ALLOW LOCAL CONTROL TO CONTINUE IF AS A LOCAL JURISDICTION ONE TO ZONE THE AN AREA RESIDENTIAL TOURISM. WHICH EXPLICITLY ALLOWS IT IT WOULD BE THAT THE ALLOWS LOCAL CONTROL -- I OF WHERE OF THOSE -- RESIDENTIAL TOURISM ZONES ARE -- AND THE OTHER THING IS YOU KNOW THE THE THE NETWORK AROUND SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS AND THE CAUSES OF THIS PARTICULARLY COMPLEX. BECAUSE YOU DO OF THE COSTA COMMISSION -- INVOLVED AT THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. YOU HAVE THE PLATFORMS OPERATE OUTSIDE OF THAT -- AS WELL AS INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY OWNERS AND SO WE TRY TO CRAFT A PATH OF THIS BILL THAT PRESERVES PROPERTY RIGHTS I THINK AS ONE OF THE OPPONENTS EVEN STATED. LONG BEFORE THERE WAS AIRBNB -- FOLKS ARE RENTING OUT SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS AND ALL THOSE THINGS THAT THEY DID BEFORE AIRBNB CAN STILL HAPPEN AND ARE NOT REGULATED AND ANYWAY BY THIS BILL. THIS BILL ONLY REGULATES THE PROP PLATFORMS THE NUMBER OF DAYS THAT A UNIT CAN BE RENTED OVER THE PLATFORM IN THE COASTAL ZONE IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY BECAUSE WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS AND THESE UNITS -- THE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL PLATFORMS ARE AMPLIFYING OF THE REMOVAL OF SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS FROM -- OUR HOUSING MARKET AND I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO NOTE THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND IS THIS THE PILOT UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SAN DIEGO COUNTY HAS ABOUT ONE PER. ONE THOUSAND A LOW COST IN OUR LOW COST ACCOMMODATION RIGHT ARE NOT LOW COST COMPETITION ACCOMMODATION RATE AND THAT'S IN THE BECAUSE THE COMMISSION'S OWN REPORT. SO WE'RE ALREADY DOING A GOOD JOB OF PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE COAST AND AGAIN I LIKE TO REITERATE THAT THIS BILL ABSOLUTELY ALLOWS FOR THE OCCASIONAL HOME SHARE THE PERSON WHO'S ON SITE TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE COAST. I GUESS WELL WELL TWO THINGS. THE LEGISLATURE HAS THAT CLEAN MADE ITS INTENTION IT'S CLEAR THAT WE NEED TO BE ADDRESSING THE HOUSING SHORTAGE. FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WE'VE ALSO BEEN TALKING ABOUT ACCESS TO THE COAST FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR INLAND COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE. AND A LODGING BEING ONE OF THE ONE OF THE BEARS THAT WE TRY TO TALK ABOUT HER AND THE LEGISLATURE'S I THINK BOTH ISSUES. HAVE HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE DISCUSSES THE PRIORITY BY THE LEGISLATURE. AND WHAT I'M HAVING A HARD TIME THIS. UNDERSTANDING WHERE THE HOW THIS BALANCE IS STILL FOR TWO PIECES AND THE PART OF MY QUESTION IS IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT CURRENTLY A LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN GO TO THE CLOSE THE COMMISSION. TO TRY TO PASS REGULATIONS DEALING WITH OUR VACATION RENTALS. WHY IS THAT NOT SUFFICIENT IS MY QUESTION SO THE BECAUSE THE COMMISSION I THINK IT WAS A DONE BY THE COMMITTEE NOW SAYS VERY ASTUTELY -- THE BECAUSE COMMISSION ONLY AS PER VIEW OVER ACCESS TO THE COAST THEY DO NOT HAVE PER VIEW OVER BALANCING. THE IMPACT ON RENTAL PRICES FOR EXAMPLE -- FOR THOSE WHO LIVE THERE SO A SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL ORDINANCE THAT WOULD NOT BE REVIEWED UNDER THE COSTA COMMISSIONS PER VIEW OF WHAT IS THE FACT ON HOUSING AFFORDABILITY FROM THAT -- ORDNANCE. AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS OF ALLOWING BECAUSE THE COMMISSION TO STILL HAVE THEIR RIGHT -- OVER AND EVALUATING THE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL ORDINANCES AND MAKING SURE THEY'RE ENSURING ACCESS TO THE COAST WHICH THEY DO IN EVERY SINGLE ORDINANCE IN. SAN DIEGO COUNTY -- AND THEN CAPPING WHAT'S THIS AMPLIFICATION BECAUSE AS I SHARED BEFORE YOU GOT HERE ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- YOU KNOW AN ID WE HAVE A CASE OF TWO HUNDRED UNITS. IT JUST WHAT IT JUST GOT COMPLETED AND AN EIGHT OF THEM ARE ALREADY FULL TIME SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS. THAT CITY AB DOES NOT HAVE A SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL CRISIS THAT CITY HAS A HOUSING CRISIS. AND THIS IS THE STRAW STRUGGLE THAT WE ALL HAVE AND SO -- I I TAKE THE CITY OF CROSS BUT THE CITY OF CARLSBAD THEY WOULD HAVE BANNED THE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS ENTIRELY ON THEIR CITY. BECAUSE THEY HAVE A GROWTH MANAGEMENT PLAN AND THEY ARE ON TRACK FOR MAKING SURE THEY REACH THEIR HOUSING AFFORDABILITY GOALS. AND THEY WERE REQUIRED TO PUT IT IN THERE -- WHICH IS NOT BAD WE WANT TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE COAST -- BUT THIS IS AMPLIFYING IT TO THE POINT WHERE DEVELOPERS ARE GOING IN AND LOOKING TO LOOK USE OUR STATE WIDE STREAMLINING MEASURES THAT WE'RE PASSING. TO BUILD A HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT ZONES AND CONVERTING THEM TO FULL TIME SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY CAN MAKE MORE MONEY WITH. THIS IS THE REALITY REALITY SO IF WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS WE DEAL WITH THAT WE STOP THE BLEEDING FIRST. AND THEN WE GO AHEAD AND AND ADDRESS A YOU KNOW HOW WE STILL HAVE TO BUILD MORE HOUSING CLEARLY YOU KNOW. AND I WOULD ST WITH YOUR EXAMPLE -- AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND TWENTY FIVE WERE SET ASIDE FOR THE CERTIFICATION IT'S THE IDEA THAT WE WE MULTI TASK HERE WE HAVE. TO YOU KNOW TALK ABOUT COMPETING INTERESTS AT TIMES OUT THERE -- AND I I DON'T KNOW. THE THEY'RE THEY'RE BOTH EQUALLY IMPORTANT -- I KNOW THAT AIRBNB IS SOMETHING THAT I USE -- IT'S SOMETHING THAT MAKE CONSTITUENTS ON THE RARE OCCASION THAT THEY CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN THIS EVEN THEN THEY CAN'T MAKE IT HAPPEN VERY OFTEN. SOMETHING THAT THAT THAT THEY USE OUT THERE AND SO AXIS IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT WHEN I'M WE'RE SITTING HERE WAITING ON LEGISLATION REMIXES JUST LIKE WHY DO YOU CARE ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE READY CARE ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE COAST NONE OF THAT AFFECTS ME AND IT AND THEY'RE NOT CONNECTED. TO IT AND THAT'S PART OF THAT ACCESS SO THAT. I COULD EASILY TO THEM THE BIGGER ECOSYSTEM AND HOW IT IS CONNECTED THE SOMETIMES THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT IF I TAKING THEM OR HAVING THEM HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE THERE -- THANK YOU FOR FOR YASSER STILL SO AND I APPRECIATE THIS TO BE CLEAR THE IB EXAMPLE. TWENTY FIVE OF THOSE UNITS WERE NOT SET ASIDE FOR SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE -- TWO HUNDRED RENTAL UNITS -- PERMANENTLY AND I'D BE AND TWENTY FIVE OF THOSE TWO HUNDRED ARE NOW FULL TIME SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO NEED TO HAVE A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD. IN SOUTH SAN DIEGO COUNTY THEY DON'T HAVE ONE AND THE OTHER THING IS I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT WHEN WHEN AIRBNB SAYS. THAT THEY HAVE RUN OUT ON AVERAGE OF NINETY FIVE NIGHT THAT'S CALCULATING FOR PEOPLE I BELIEVE PER ROOM AND THAT'S TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A NIGHT I'M NOT SURE ABOUT YOU BUT WHEN MY FAMILY GOES STAYS AT THE IKANA LOGINH ANTHONY THIS FOR EIGHTY NINE DOLLARS A NIGHT. WE ALL YOU KNOW BUNDLE UP AND FOR PEOPLE IN ONE HOTEL ROOM FOR EIGHTY NINE AT NIGHT. SO JUST -- TO GIVE SOME -- YOU KNOW CONTACTS FOR OTHER PRICING IN IN THE DISTRICT [inaudible] MR FLORA. SAYED DON'T REALLY KNOW SO I HAVE A QUESTION BUT I CERTAINLY ECHO SO LITERACY IS COMMENTS -- THERE ARE SOME GREAT CONCERNS ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE OF US TO LIVE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. YOU KNOW IT TO ME THIS SOUNDS LIKE A VERY MUCH A SUPPLY DEMAND ISSUE. THAT IF THERE IS A DEMAND EVEN IF THERE ARE INVESTORS THAT ARE INVESTING IN THESE HOMES CLEARLY THERE IS A DEMAND. AND SO IF THERE IS PEOPLE THAT ARE WANTING TO GO TO THE COAST THERE NEEDING PLACES TO STAY. WE SHOULD PROVIDE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO. SO IF WE CUT THE AVAILABLE ROOMS WHATEVER THEY MAY BE. OBVIOUSLY THE PRICE IS GOING UP THEY'RE GONNA CHARGE MORE FOR THAT SO WE CREATE THIS ACCESS ISSUE AND IF YOU DO GET LUCKY AND BE ABLE TO GET SOMEBODY. YOU HAVE AG PRICING PROBLEM WHERE A LOT OF MY CONSTITUENTS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD THAT. SO THIS THING TO ME -- I DON'T LIKE THE FACT THAT WE'RE TELLING PEOPLE WHAT TO DO WITH THE PRIVATE PROPERTY I DON'T PARTICULARLY LOVE THAT. BUT FOR ME IT'S IT'S AND WE WANNA TALK ABOUT EQUITY ALL DAY LONG IN THIS BUILDING. OKAY WE DON'T LIVE ON THE COAST WERE FARM COUNTRY WE LIKE TO VISIT. I'VE TRIED TO GET HOTEL ROOMS AND SAN DIEGO WHEN THERE'S CONVENTIONS GOING ON AND GUESS WHAT WE'RE BEING BE AN BECAUSE THERE WAS NO HOTELS AVAILABLE. SO THIS IS A HUGE CONCERN OF MINE AND I DO WANNA -- KNOWS THE OPPOSITION WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE RATES -- JUST LIKE YOU MAYBE TO HEAR YOUR COMMENTS ON SOME OF THOSE RATES AND HOW ROOMS THE RATES ARE SET A PARTICULAR ROOMS AS A RELEASED ACCURACY. CERTAINLY -- DO HAVE A TIME LIMIT I A MINUTE ALL THE START. UP TO THE CHAIR. REVIEWS YOU CAN MAKE IT IS VERY COMPETITION ALL TRY TO I CAN TALK ABOUT THIS STUFF ALL DAY -- I I AM PRIMARILY BY THE COAST I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE TALK ABOUT RATES TO FACTOR IN THE THE WHOLE EQUATION WHEN YOU SAID A HOTEL YOU PAY FOR PARKING YOU PAY FOR INTERNET USAGE YOU PAY YOUR ROOM. YOU PAY A HOTEL RESORT FEE -- AND THEN OF COURSE YOU ALSO PAY FOR YOUR NIGHTLY RATE -- YES RATES ARE SUBSTANTIALLY CHEAPER WHEN YOU DIVIDE THEM BY ROOM IF YOU'RE FOR EXAMPLE LOOKING AT A TWO BEDROOM CONDO IN MISSION BEACH AS OPPOSED TO TRYING TO GET IF YOU CAN EVEN FIND -- ONE TO HOTEL ROOMS AT A LOCAL HOTEL THERE IS NO COMPARISON BUT FACTORED INTO THAT THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A KITCHEN. THAT YOU CAN THEN COOK YOUR OWN MEALS -- WHICH FOR A LOT OF OUR GUESTS ARE STAYING WITH FAMILIES IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT -- YOU KNOW THE THE THAT IS THE NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO REASON WE HEAR FROM OUR GAS WHY THEY WANT. TO STAY IN A SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL AS OPPOSED TO A HOTEL BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE KIDS -- YOU WOULD MUCH PREFER TO COOK YOUR OWN MEALS YOU SAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY AND IT IS MUCH CHEAPER AND TACKLE YOUR POINTS ARE FROM GOING TOO QUICKLY. IS THAT ALONG THE COAST AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I CAN TELL YOU YOU CANNOT FIND A HOTEL ROOM THERE IS NO AVAILABILITY I MEAN WE HAVE PEOPLE HERE FROM THE HOTEL INDUSTRY I WOULD BE CURIOUS TO SEE. WHAT THEY'RE VACANCY RATES ARE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR HOTEL ROOMS WHETHER PD CONNELL LODGE -- Là BALENCIAGA THERE ARE NO HOTEL ROOMS HOTELS ARE COMPLETELY SOLD OUT AND TO YOUR POINT. IF YOU LIMIT THE AVAILABILITY OF SHORT TERM RENTALS DRASTICALLY WHICH THIS WOULD BY MY CALCULATIONS BY 9295% OF COURSE RATES HOTEL RATES ARE GONNA GO UP AS TALK AS VACANCY GOES. UP AND IS AVAILABILITY GOES DOWN THEN RATES GO UP SO IT IS NO SURPRISE THAT THOSE THAT ARE. FOCUSED ON SUPPORTING THIS BILL ARE PRIMARILY FROM THE HOTEL INDUSTRY. I HAVE TO JUST SAY I I DRAFTED THIS BILL MYSELF BECAUSE THIS IS A CRISIS IN MY COMMUNITY THIS IS A CRISIS PEOPLE DO NOT. THEY THEY CANNOT FIND SOMEWHERE AFFORDABLE TO RENT AND YES THERE'S A SUPPLY PROBLEM ABSOLUTELY THERE'S MORE WE HAVE TO BUILD. BUT WHEN WE ARE BLEEDING OUT UNIT AFTER UNIT AFTER UNIT. YOU KNOW WE ARE NOT ADDRESSING THE SUPPLY PROBLEM ON OUT WE'RE NOT ADDRESSING PRESERVING WHAT'S HERE AND I THINK ONE OF MY WITNESSES SAID THIS BUT WE'RE AFFECTIVELY DEMOLISHING UNITS AND NOT REPLACING THEM FOR A HOUSING MARKET. AND I RESPECT THAT YOUR CONSTITUENTS WANT TO COME TO SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND STATE AND WE HAVE MANY PROVISIONS OF THIS THIS IS JUST CAMP CAPPING THE AMPLIFICATION OF THE SUMMER I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A ABILITY TO CLOSE. SO I'M JUST GONNA LET THE COMMITTEE MINISH ASKING QUESTIONS THAT'S OKAY THANK YOU YOU ARE THE WITNESSES. BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT I MEAN I I DO WANT TO PAUSE FOR SECOND WAS I WAS A QUORUM. WE CAN TAKE ROLL CALL. MEMBERS FRIEDMAN HERE FRIEDMAN HERE FLORA FLOOR HERE CHAU EGGMAN. EGGMAN HERE GARCIA GARCIA HERE LIMóN MATHIS. MATHIS HERE MCCARTY MELENDEZ MURATSUCHI STONE [inaudible] SHOWN HERE. THANK YOU HAVE A QUORUM -- SO AT ANY OTHER MEMBERS THEN MR MATHIS [inaudible] I LOOKED. WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS EVERYWHERE IT'S NOT JUST SAN DIEGO COUNTY SAN DIEGO COUNTY IS NOT EVEN THAT TOP TWENTY COUNTIES THAT ARE GROWING. IN THE STATE. WHERE I MET IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WERE GROWING FASTER? WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH THE GATEWAY TO THIS YEAR AS AN AND QUITE FRANKLY I'M NOT RUNNING A BILL TO BLOCK AIRBNB. RENTALS FOR THE GATEWAY OF THE SIERRAS IN WE FRESNO EVERYBODY GOING UP IN THE U. SOMEBODY. THE HOTEL GET PACKED THEIR TO SO. IT'S TO ME I'M JUST REALLY TRYING. TO YOU KNOW I OTHERS SHARE THE STORY THE AND I'M A HOST AT FOR A FOREIGN EXCHANGE STUDENT THIS YEAR. AND WE HAD FIFTEEN FOR EXCHANGE STUDENTS THE WANTED TO GO DOWN TO DISNEYLAND. AS AS PART OF THEIR BUCKET LIST FOR WEATHER HERE. AND WE LOOKED AT HOTELS. IN THE COSTA HOTELS. WAS MORE THAN THE COST FOR AIRBNB. DOWN THERE [inaudible] AND THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE OING TO FIT FIFTEEN STUDENTS. PLUS THE CHAPERONES. AND EVERYBODY ELSE IN A HOTEL. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. YOUR WILL FINING AIRBNB FOR TWO HUNDRED BUCKS A NIGHT AND WE'RE ABLE TO COOK FOR THEM. IN ENSURE THEY HAD SOMETHING GOOD TO EAT WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO BLOW ALL THEIR MONEY. JUST TO GET A CHEESEBURGER AND IT WORKED AND IT WAS A FISSION. AND EVERYBODY HAD A GREAT TIME. IT WAS ECONOMICAL AND THESE KIDS DIDN'T HAVE TO BLOW ALL THEIR BUDGETS. THE HOST PARENTS HAT. WE'RE ABLE TO DO IT. IN THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE [inaudible] WHEN? PEOPLE ARE LOOKING TO TRAVEL EXPRESSIONS TO THE COAST. IT'S AN EXTREMELY HIGH COSTS. IF I'M GONNA TAKE MY KIDS DOWN TO SEA WORLD. NOT NOT ONLY IS THE DRIVE A LONG DRIVE FOR US. BUT THEN THE HOTEL COSTS IS EVEN MORE. IT'S ME MORE TALK ABOUT TAKING THE KIDS DOWN OF THE SAN DIEGO ZOO DOWN TO ZERO DOWN ALL THESE GREAT THINGS. AND WE DON'T. BECAUSE OF THE COST. IT DOESN'T ADD UP. IN THE ONLY OPTIONS REALLY LAUGHED OR OR TO PLAN IT OUT TO BUDGET IN NOW. INDEED DO SOMETHING LIKE AN INTERVIEW BECAUSE WE HAD TO HAVE A LARGE FAMILY. I I JUST DON'T IN AN ON A WHOLE OTHER THING. PICKING AND CHOOSING AND PIECE MILLING WELL THIS IS GOOD FOR THIS COUNTY BUT NOT THIS COUNTY. WE'RE DOING POLICY FOR THE ENTIRE STATE HERE. AND AND IT DRIVES ME NUTS WHEN WE TRY TO CARVE OUT. SINGLE COUNTIES BECAUSE THE COUNTIES HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THIS THEMSELVES IF THEY DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT. SO IF THOSE SUPERVISORS DON'T WANT AIRBNB THEN THEY CAN STEP UP AND DO THEIR OWN COUNTY ORDINANCE. TO LOCK THE AIRBNB EASE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THESE THINGS. SO IT IT IS. I I DON'T THINK THE BILL'S PUT TOGETHER RIGHT I THINK YOU'RE TRYING -- TO OVERREACH AND I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THIS. THANK YOU US SOME MEMBER EGGMAN. YEAH JUST -- AND AND WE'VE WE'VE ALREADY HAD THIS CONVERSATION THAT -- I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO BUT AS SOMEBODY WHO CAME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT I'VE I JUST FEELS TO ME LIKE A REAL OVER REACH I THINK PEOPLE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO THAT -- I'VE I'VE TRAVELED AROUND IN THE WITH THE NEW ORLEANS PLACES THEY HAVE COME TOGETHER AND AND CREATED AN ORDINANCE TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE OF OF HOUSING STOCK VERSES. PEOPLE AND IF YOU KNOW THERE'S ONE THING HOPEFULLY NONE OF US TRY TO DO IS BE A HYPOCRITE I'M LOOKING. AT MY OTHER IPAD BECAUSE THIS THIS MORNING I BOOKED A PLACE TO V. R. BO AND IN FORT BRAGG FOR MY FAMILY TO BE ABLE TO GO OVER THE HOLIDAYS SO MANY PEOPLE USE IT PROVIDE YOU KNOW A LOT OF HOTELS ARE EXPENSIVE. THEM SO. AS I SHARED WITH YOU I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO -- MAYBE THIS BILL COULD LAST A BIT LONGER AND YOU CAN WORK TO GET MORE WITH YOUR YOUR LOCALS. AND SEE IF YOU CAN COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT'S WORKABLE AND ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBER. I'LL JUST MAKE A FEW COMMENTS A MINIMAL WILL ASK YOU TO CLOSE FIRST OF ALL I HAVE TO HAND IT TO FOR TAKING ON A REALLY CONTROVERSY ALL. AND REALLY DIFFICULT SUBJECT HI YOU'RE TO BE COMMENDED THE I KNOW THAT THIS IS A HUGE ISSUE IN YOUR COMMUNITY. AND I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY AND I YOU KNOW I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE JUST THAT YOU WERE WILLING AS A FRESHMAN TO JUMP IN AND AND TAKE THIS ON YOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT YOU GET THE VOTES SO. IF YOU KNOW GOOD FOR YOU -- AND THERE IS A REAL PROBLEM WITH AFFORDABILITY AND WITH LOSING -- OF LONG TERM YOU KNOW NORMAL STABILIZE DEPARTMENTS IN YOUR COMMUNITY -- AND YOU KNOW ALSO FINDING THAT BALANCE WITH THE COASTAL ACCESS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES. FOR PEOPLE -- TO FIND ACCOMMODATIONS FOR SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS AND FOR OVERNIGHT STAYS AND BALANCING THAT IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT -- I YOU KNOW I'M CONCERT I I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL I'M CONCERNED ABOUT SORT OF THE FAVORITISM THAT IT'S SORT OF SHOWING SOME PLATFORMS OVER OTHERS AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE PLATFORMS THAT ARE USED MORE. MAY BE SEEN AS BEING MORE DISRUPTIVE -- BUT KIND OF A FOCUSING ON THE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS BUT LEAVING CRAIG'S LIST LEAVING IT UP TO PEOPLE TO RUN THEIR OWN WEBSITES -- IS A BIT OF A CONCERN FOR ME GIVEN THAT CRISIS HAS NO PROTECTIONS THAT OFFER THE USERS WERE AS THE OTHER PLATFORMS DO HAVE. PROTECTIONS THEY ALSO DO WORK BETTER WITH THE CITIES IN TERMS OF COLLECTING TO TEAMWORK CRAIG'S. AND OTHER SITES DON'T DO THAT AT ALL SO YOU KNOW TO ME THAT'S THAT'S A BIT OF AN ISSUE I ALSO THOUGHT THAT YOU KNOW GIVEN THE COASTAL COMMISSION LIMITED AUTHORITY. TO PROMOTE AFFORDABLE VISITOR ACCOMMODATIONS AGAINST PRESERVING AFFORDABLE HOUSING WAS MAYBE SEVEN THE COASTAL COMMISSION ITSELF COULD JUST BE ASSIGNED TO TO TRY TO FIND A WAY OF FINDING THAT BALANCE RATHER RATHER THAN DOING THIS BILL. HOWEVER WHAT I APPRECIATE IS THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS AS A PILOT IN A SMALL AREA WITH THE STUDY AT THE END SO THAT WE CAN. EVALUATE THIS SO THAT AS WE LOOK AT OTHER AREAS THAT IN HIGH DEMAND WHETHER IT'S THIS YEAR IS OR TAHOE OR OTHER COASTAL AREAS OR AT LEAST WILL BE DATA AND KIND OF AN EXPERIMENT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS. WORKS AT ALL IT IS ABLE TO FIND THAT BALANCE SO I I CAN SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY -- BUT AGAIN I KNOW IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IT'S A TOUGH SUBJECT AND WITH THAT I WOULD INVITE YOU TO MAKE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I AS I'VE ALWAYS DONE I AM WELCOME I YOU KNOW I'M ALWAYS WILLING TO WORK. WITH THE OPPOSITION AND CONTINUE TO KEEP OPEN DIALOGUES -- AND IT REALLY ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE SAN DIEGO COUNTY -- YOU KNOW I I THINK AS YOU KNOW EVERY CITY HAS THE RIGHT TO REGULATE OR BAN ON SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS AS THESE SEE FIT UNLESS YOU'RE IN THE COASTAL ZONE. AND SO THIS IS REALLY TRYING TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE OF ALL YOU KNOW PRESERVING PROPERTY RIGHTS PRESERVING LOCAL CONTROL -- BUT PRESERVING BECAUSE THE COMMISSION'S AUTHORITY OVER COASTAL ACCESS BUT GETTING AT THE TOP OF THE REMOVAL OF HOUSING FOR MY HOUSING MARKET. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU WITH THAT CAN WE HAVE A ROLL CALL -- I'M SORRY WE DON'T HAVE A MOTION. THE MOTION TO HAVE A SECOND.
