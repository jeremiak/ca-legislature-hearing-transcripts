THAT REASON AS YOU OUTLINED

00:28:55.266 --> 00:28:56.901
NINETY FIVE PERCENT. OF LITHIUM

00:28:56.968 --> 00:28:59.704
TODAY IS PRODUCED IN CHILE

00:28:59.771 --> 00:29:01.773
ARGENTINA AUSTRALIA AND CHINA.

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:02.941

00:29:03.007 --> 00:29:06.244
GEOGRAPHIC GOOD FORTUNE. TO

LIVING I THINK THE BEST WAY TO

00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:28.266
UNDERSTAND IT. IS TO REALLY

00:29:28.333 --> 00:29:30.368
THINK ABOUT IT AS THE OIL OF

00:29:30.435 --> 00:29:32.337
THE CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE. IT IS

00:29:32.403 --> 00:29:34.205
FUNDAMENTAL TO EVERYTHING WE'RE

00:29:34.272 --> 00:29:36.841

IT'S NOT JUST GOOD. TESLA IS

00:29:41.446 --> 00:29:43.348
THE MOST NOTABLE CAR CAN BE THE

00:29:43.414 --> 00:29:43.915

ALMOST FORTY YEARS CALLED.

00:34:40.945 --> 00:34:45.216
GREATER. WHICH IS THE

00:34:45.283 --> 00:34:46.083
GEOTHERMAL. RESEARCH

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:47.518

THOSE CONCERNS. ARE BEING

CAN BE SAID ABOUT WHAT THE

00:58:14.657 --> 00:58:16.559
FUTURE LOOKS LIKE WHY WHY WE

IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS NEW

00:58:52.028 --> 00:58:54.297
TECHNOLOGY THAT AS WE HAVE. A

00:58:54.364 --> 00:58:55.498
CERTAIN GOALS THAT WE NEED TO

00:58:55.565 --> 00:58:58.668
ACHIEVE 1100% RENEWABLE BY

00:58:58.735 --> 00:58:59.269
TWENTY FORTY FIVE THAT WE ARE

00:58:59.335 --> 00:59:01.604
ALSO. THINKING ABOUT WAYS IN

00:59:01.671 --> 00:59:05.008
WHICH WE ARE PROACTIVELY. ALSO

00:59:05.074 --> 00:59:06.276

A BIT AND I AND I UNDERSTAND

00:59:10.146 --> 00:59:12.649
MISTER TURNER WILL ALSO. BE

00:59:12.715 --> 00:59:14.017
HAVE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:59:14.083 --> 00:59:16.319
ASK SIMILAR QUESTIONS TO

CARILLO APPRECIATE THE

00:59:20.657 --> 00:59:23.760
QUESTION- YEAH I JUST WOULD I

00:59:23.826 --> 00:59:25.328
GUESS BEGIN BY TWENTY I THINK

00:59:25.395 --> 00:59:27.363
FOSSIL FUEL EXTRACTION HAS

00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:29.699
BEEN. ONE OF THE MOST HARMFUL

00:59:29.766 --> 00:59:32.669
THINGS TO COMMUNITIES AROUND

00:59:32.735 --> 00:59:33.202
THE WORLD AND PERSONALLY

00:59:33.269 --> 00:59:35.672
EVERYWHERE ONLINE AFRICA OUT OF

00:59:35.738 --> 00:59:37.140
THIS IS THAT JUST THE LOCAL

00:59:37.206 --> 00:59:41.577
POLLUTION AND EMISSIONS- AND-

00:59:41.644 --> 00:59:45.214
DOES INDUSTRIES OFTEN HAVE-

00:59:45.281 --> 00:59:47.884
FULLER JOBS THAT THE ARE ALSO

00:59:47.951 --> 00:59:48.885
LEARNING PRACTICAL HEALTH AND I

00:59:48.952 --> 00:59:51.554
THINK. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:59:51.621 --> 00:59:54.390
SIX ABOUT THIS RESOURCE IS THAT

00:59:54.457 --> 00:59:57.327
IT IS BY FAR THE GREENEST AND

00:59:57.393 --> 00:59:58.962
MOST SUSTAINABLE WAY TO RECOVER

00:59:59.028 --> 01:00:00.763
LITHIUM. ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD

01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:02.865
SO IN ARGENTINA AND CHILE THE

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:04.701
WAY THEY GET A LOOK HERE MISS

01:00:04.767 --> 01:00:06.436
THESE MASSIVE EVAPORATION

01:00:06.502 --> 01:00:08.638
PONDS- WERE THERE TO TAKE A

01:00:08.705 --> 01:00:10.606
QUITE A BIG FOOTPRINT TO DO

01:00:10.673 --> 01:00:12.508
THAT IN PLACES LIKE CHINA AND

01:00:12.575 --> 01:00:13.943
AUSTRALIA GOOD MORNING WILL

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:16.279
ROCK. UP IN A DUSTING IT UP BUT

01:00:16.346 --> 01:00:19.415
IT'S- IT HAS A BIGGER FOOTPRINT

01:00:19.482 --> 01:00:21.517
THIS IS BASICALLY TAKING THE

01:00:21.584 --> 01:00:23.152
SUPERHEATED GROWING THAT'S

01:00:23.219 --> 01:00:24.153
ALREADY BELOW THE GROUND IS

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:25.655
ALREADY BEING CYCLE DIGITAL

01:00:25.722 --> 01:00:27.223
POWER PLANTS. YEAH THERE'S A

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:29.826
PROCESS TO WITHDRAW THE

01:00:29.892 --> 01:00:31.327
LITHIUM- THERE'S MULTIPLE

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:33.496
TECHNOLOGIES TO DO THIS ONE OF

01:00:33.563 --> 01:00:34.764
THEM IS THEY JUST HAVE THIS

01:00:34.831 --> 01:00:36.966
ALSO BASICALLY TRACTABILITY OF

01:00:37.033 --> 01:00:38.201
THE TECHNOLOGY WHICH WOULD

01:00:38.267 --> 01:00:39.736
THINK ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES

01:00:39.802 --> 01:00:41.204
COUPLE DIFFERENT BILL OF THAT

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:43.806
BUT IT'S A VERY VERY LIGHT.

01:00:43.873 --> 01:00:45.708
FOOTPRINT CLOSED LOOP ZERO

01:00:45.775 --> 01:00:47.210
WASTE PROCESS- AND I THINK IT'S

01:00:47.276 --> 01:00:48.778
REALLY ONE OF THE EXCITING

01:00:48.845 --> 01:00:50.313
THINGS THAT WE CAN PRODUCES AT

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:54.117
SCALE BUT HOW ABOUT- REALLY

01:00:54.183 --> 01:00:55.918
REALLY MINIMAL IMPACT AND I

01:00:55.985 --> 01:00:57.353
THINK THAT'S- GOOD FOR THE

01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:05.895
COMMUNITY AND. AND GOOD FOR

01:01:05.962 --> 01:01:07.163
LARGER GOALS AS WELL. THANK I

01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:08.431
THINK THERE'S FOLLOW UP. THING

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:10.666
YOU MISTER- CHAIR CHILD AYE AYE

01:01:10.733 --> 01:01:11.601
HAVE I HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN TO

01:01:11.667 --> 01:01:13.102
THE LITHIUM. MINES AND SHE AND

01:01:13.169 --> 01:01:14.437
TOTAL AND HAVE C. FIRST HAND.

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:15.805
OUT WHAT THOSE PLANS LOOK LIKE

01:01:15.872 --> 01:01:17.640
AND HOW THE LITHIUM IS

01:01:17.707 --> 01:01:18.841
EXTRACTED THROUGH PIPELINES AND

01:01:18.908 --> 01:01:20.843
SO. OF COURSE THAT IT LOOKS A

01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:22.245
CERTAIN WAY IT HAS A CERTAIN

01:01:22.311 --> 01:01:24.113
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT A- CHILLER

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:25.848
SELLS MOST OF ITS- MY

01:01:25.915 --> 01:01:27.116
UNDERSTANDING FROM THAT TRIP IS

01:01:27.183 --> 01:01:28.284
THAT SHE'LL ALSO SELLS MOST OF

01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:30.353
ITS- LITHIUM TO CHINA SO AGAIN

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:31.921
THERE'S THE COMPETITIVE NATURE

01:01:31.988 --> 01:01:33.656
OF. OF WHAT THAT MARKET LOOKS

01:01:33.723 --> 01:01:35.124
LIKE AND WHAT THE OPPORTUNITIES

01:01:35.191 --> 01:01:36.392
FOR CALIFORNIA LOOK LIKE AND I

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:38.428
WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED IN AND

01:01:38.494 --> 01:01:40.263
KNOWING A LITTLE BIT MORE. OF

01:01:40.329 --> 01:01:43.966
THE SOME OF THE EXTRACTION

01:01:44.033 --> 01:01:45.501
METHODS- THAT. CAN LOOK VERY

01:01:45.568 --> 01:01:46.602
DIFFERENT AND ARE MORE

01:01:46.669 --> 01:01:47.703
ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND AND

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:50.106
FAMILY THAT WOULD THAT WHAT I

01:01:50.173 --> 01:01:50.740
SAW IN CHILE SO THINK THANK YOU

01:01:50.807 --> 01:01:53.509
FOR THAT. WHAT IS THAT ONE OF

01:01:53.576 --> 01:01:54.410
THE THINGS THAT WE LIKE TO

01:01:54.477 --> 01:01:55.912
EXPLORE WITH THE LIFFEY VALLEY

01:01:55.978 --> 01:01:57.980
COMMISSION IS. ACTUALLY A SITE

01:01:58.047 --> 01:02:00.650
VISIT- FOR INTERESTED MEMBERS

01:02:00.716 --> 01:02:01.150

01:02:01.217 --> 01:02:03.352
TOGETHER AND BRING. SOME OF OUR

01:02:03.419 --> 01:02:04.821
EXPERTS SPOTTED A BUNCH OF

01:02:04.887 --> 01:02:06.756
THESE- DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS.

01:02:06.823 --> 01:02:09.392
DONE I THINK I LOOK HEREFROM.

01:02:09.459 --> 01:02:11.194
A COUPLE THE DEVELOPERS WHO ARE

HEAR ME. GOOD WE OCT. I I DON'T

01:12:30.212 --> 01:12:31.313
HAVE A PREPARED STATEMENT WHAT

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:32.915
I WANT TO DO THOSE KIND OF PLAY

01:12:32.981 --> 01:12:34.783
CLEAN UP HERE TO TRY TO ADDRESS

01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:35.884
SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE

01:12:35.951 --> 01:12:36.819
ALREADY COME UP BUT LET ME TALK

01:12:36.885 --> 01:12:38.420
ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY FOR

01:12:38.487 --> 01:12:39.755
LITHIUM PRODUCTION. THAT'S BEEN

01:12:39.822 --> 01:12:41.724
ASKED ABOUT HIM SOME TIME LINES

01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:42.624
AND SOME OF THE BARRIERS AND

01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:44.993
HURDLES- WE STARTED THIRTY FIVE

01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:46.829
YEARS AGO AS CAL ENERGY WE OWN

01:12:46.895 --> 01:12:48.130
AND OPERATE TEN OF THE ELEVEN

01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:50.199
GEOTHERMAL PLANTS. ADJACENT OF

01:12:50.265 --> 01:12:52.301
THE SALT SEA WHERE WE PRODUCE

01:12:52.367 --> 01:12:53.368
THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MEGAWATTS

01:12:53.435 --> 01:12:56.371
OF GEOTHERMAL POWER WE'VE GOT

01:12:56.438 --> 01:12:57.106
TWENTY ONE GEO THERMAL

01:12:57.172 --> 01:12:58.974
PRODUCTION WELLS AND THEY PUT

01:12:59.041 --> 01:13:00.809
THEY BRING UP GEOTHERMAL BRINE

01:13:00.876 --> 01:13:02.111
AT TEMPERATURES AS HIGH AS

01:13:02.177 --> 01:13:03.212
ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED DEGREES

01:13:03.278 --> 01:13:05.214
FAHRENHEIT. AND THAT BRIAN IT'S

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:07.483
A SATURATED SOLUTION OF MANY

01:13:07.549 --> 01:13:08.717
DISSOLVED MINERALS IT'S GOT

01:13:08.784 --> 01:13:11.286
IRON CALCIUM YOU KNOW SODIUM

01:13:11.353 --> 01:13:13.088
POTASSIUM MANGANESE MET.

01:13:13.155 --> 01:13:15.424
MAGNESIUM ZINC AND OF COURSE

01:13:15.491 --> 01:13:16.925
WITH HIM AND WE'VE BEEN

01:13:16.992 --> 01:13:19.495
PROCESSING FIFTY THOUSAND

01:13:19.561 --> 01:13:21.730
GALLONS A MINUTE OF THIS BRIAN

01:13:21.797 --> 01:13:24.133
FOR THE PAST THIRTY FIVE YEARS.

01:13:24.199 --> 01:13:25.234
TO PRODUCE THAT GEOTHERMAL

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:28.771
POWER. NOW THAT BRIAN'S GOT TWO

01:13:28.837 --> 01:13:29.404
HUNDRED FIFTY PARTS PER MILLION

01:13:29.471 --> 01:13:31.774
OF LITHIUM- THAT DOESN'T SOUND

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:32.708
LIKE A LOT BUT IF WE CAN

01:13:32.775 --> 01:13:34.777
RECOVER. THAT LITHIUM BY THE

01:13:34.843 --> 01:13:35.644
WAY I DON'T TALK ABOUT

01:13:35.711 --> 01:13:37.513
EXTRACTING IT I'M TALKING ABOUT

01:13:37.579 --> 01:13:43.418
RECOVERY AND WE'RE NOT MINING.

01:13:43.485 --> 01:13:45.921
A THOUSAND TIMES A YEAR IN A

01:13:45.988 --> 01:13:47.856
WORLD MARKET TODAY OF ABOUT

01:13:47.923 --> 01:13:48.457
THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND SO WE

01:13:48.524 --> 01:13:49.925
COULD EASILY SUPPLY AT LEAST A

01:13:49.992 --> 01:13:52.528
QUARTER OF CURRENT WORLD DEMAND

01:13:52.594 --> 01:13:54.062
THE TECHNOLOGY HAS NOT BEEN

01:13:54.129 --> 01:13:55.597
PROVEN ON A COMMERCIAL SCALE

01:13:55.664 --> 01:13:57.199
AND THAT'S BEEN THE BARRIER SO

01:13:57.266 --> 01:13:59.368
WHERE GOAL IS WE WANT TO CRAWL

01:13:59.434 --> 01:14:01.003
BEFORE WE WALK AND WALK BEFORE

01:14:01.069 --> 01:14:02.971
WE RUN SO WHERE GOAL WAS LET'S

01:14:03.038 --> 01:14:05.440
GET THERE ARE IN THE FUNDING TO

01:14:05.507 --> 01:14:07.109
BUILD DEMONSTRATION PLANTS. AT

01:14:07.176 --> 01:14:09.144
A ONE TENTH COMMERCIAL SCALE TO

01:14:09.211 --> 01:14:10.679
DO THIS WE CAN RECOVER LITHIUM

01:14:10.746 --> 01:14:12.481
IN THE LAB IT'S NOT ALCHEMY

01:14:12.548 --> 01:14:14.583
IT'S THERE WHAT HOW DO YOU

01:14:14.650 --> 01:14:16.418
PROVE IT UP AND SCALE. WE

01:14:16.485 --> 01:14:17.419
APPLIED FOR TWO SEPARATE

01:14:17.486 --> 01:14:19.388
COMPETITIVE GRANTS ONE FROM THE

01:14:19.454 --> 01:14:20.622
ENERGY COMMISSION AND ONE FROM

01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:21.657
THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY

01:14:21.723 --> 01:14:24.493
WE WANT BOTH OF THEM. A SIX

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:25.093
MILLION DOLLAR GRANT FROM THE

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:26.495
ENERGY COMMISSION. TO SHOW THAT

01:14:26.562 --> 01:14:28.363
WE CAN PRODUCE THE WITH HIM AND

01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:30.132
A FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR GRANT

01:14:30.199 --> 01:14:31.333
FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY.

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:32.534
TO CONVERT THAT LITHIUM

01:14:32.601 --> 01:14:34.970
CHLORIDE INTO THE FEEDSTOCK FOR

01:14:35.037 --> 01:14:36.572
A BATTERY WHICH IS LITHIUM

01:14:36.638 --> 01:14:39.474
HYDROXIDE- WE WANT BOTH AND WE

01:14:39.541 --> 01:14:41.577
ARE MATCHING THOSE TWO GRANTS

01:14:41.643 --> 01:14:42.678
ONE OF SIX MILLION ONE OF

01:14:42.744 --> 01:14:45.147
FIFTEEN. WITH AN ADDITIONAL SIX

01:14:45.214 --> 01:14:46.982
MILLION AND FIFTEEN OF THEIR

01:14:47.049 --> 01:14:49.284
OWN FUNDS SO WHERE FORTY TWO

01:14:49.351 --> 01:14:50.385
MILLION DOLLARS INTO THE

01:14:50.452 --> 01:14:52.154
PROCESS. NOW LET ME GO THROUGH

01:14:52.221 --> 01:14:53.288
THE PROCESS REALLY QUICKLY

01:14:53.355 --> 01:14:55.457
FIRST THE BRIAN IS PROCESS FOR

01:14:55.524 --> 01:14:56.825
GEOTHERMAL DEVELOPMENT IT COMES

01:14:56.892 --> 01:14:59.228
OUT WE FLASH IT AT FIVE HUNDRED

01:14:59.294 --> 01:15:01.096
DEGREES. MEDIALLY COMES DOWN TO

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:02.764
ABOUT TWO FIFTY. HOW DO YOU GET

01:15:02.831 --> 01:15:06.001
THE LITHIUM HAVE YOU SEPARATED

01:15:06.068 --> 01:15:07.102
FROM THE BRINE. WE GOT WHAT'S

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:10.205
CALLED A I. ONYX. TECH THINK OF

01:15:10.272 --> 01:15:11.640
IT KIND OF IS AMONG AMONG.

01:15:11.707 --> 01:15:14.076
SIEVE THAT. LIKE EXTRA THE

01:15:14.142 --> 01:15:17.212
LISTING. BUT REJECT REJECT THE

01:15:17.279 --> 01:15:19.147
OTHER METALS THE IMPURITIES THE

01:15:19.214 --> 01:15:20.015
ONES LIKE TICKED OFF THE

01:15:20.082 --> 01:15:22.117
MAGNESIUM THE IRON CALCIUM

01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:24.019
DISODIUM. SO THIS TECHNOLOGY

01:15:24.086 --> 01:15:24.853
CAN HANDLE THE HIGH

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:27.422
TEMPERATURES IT CAN PRECIPITATE

01:15:27.489 --> 01:15:29.358
OUT THE LITHIUM- LEAVING THE

01:15:29.424 --> 01:15:30.859
IRON MAGNESIUM IN THE BRYANT

01:15:30.926 --> 01:15:33.128
AND REJECT THOSE OTHER METALS.

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:35.130
THAT CAN GO BACK DOWN HOLE INTO

01:15:35.197 --> 01:15:36.732
THE GEOTHERMAL RESERVOIR

01:15:36.798 --> 01:15:39.434
WITHOUT PRECIPITATING THEM OUT.

01:15:39.501 --> 01:15:40.869
SO AT THE END OF THAT PROCESS

01:15:40.936 --> 01:15:43.005
WE'VE GOT LITHIUM CHLORIDE. AND

01:15:43.071 --> 01:15:44.539
THEN WE GO TO STEP TWO

01:15:44.606 --> 01:15:45.641
CONVERTING THAT TO LITHIUM

01:15:45.707 --> 01:15:47.910
HYDROXIDE. FOR WHICH WE'RE

01:15:47.976 --> 01:15:49.811
GOING TO USE ELECTROLYSIS

01:15:49.878 --> 01:15:51.046
SIMPLY USING AN ELECTRIC

01:15:51.113 --> 01:15:53.181
CURRENT- TO CHURCH DRIVE A

01:15:53.248 --> 01:15:55.217
CHEMICAL CHANGE TO GO FROM.

01:15:55.284 --> 01:15:58.453
CHLORIDE TO HYDROXIDE- AND BY

01:15:58.520 --> 01:15:59.688
THE WAY THE ELECTRICITY WILL

01:15:59.755 --> 01:16:01.657
USE WILL BE RENEWABLE ENERGY IT

01:16:01.723 --> 01:16:05.260
WILL BE A GEO THERMAL POWER-

01:16:05.327 --> 01:16:05.827
AND THEN WE WILL GO THROUGH

01:16:05.894 --> 01:16:07.429
MORE. PURIFICATION

01:16:07.496 --> 01:16:09.197
CRYSTALLIZATION AND THE LIKE TO

01:16:09.264 --> 01:16:10.632
TURN WILL THIS LIQUID INTO A

01:16:10.699 --> 01:16:17.439
POWER. POWER TIME LONG. YOU

01:16:17.506 --> 01:16:20.108
KNOW I WE WANT UNDER AND TO BUT

01:16:20.175 --> 01:16:22.878
ME TELL YOU THE KERR TIME THE

01:16:22.945 --> 01:16:23.879
DEMONSTRATION PLANNED FOR K.

01:16:23.946 --> 01:16:24.947
FROM THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY

01:16:25.013 --> 01:16:27.449
COMMISSION- WE WANT THAT THAT'S

01:16:27.516 --> 01:16:28.250
WE'RE GOING TO BREAK GROUND

01:16:28.317 --> 01:16:30.185
NEXT MONTH- IN THE NEXT COUPLE

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:31.620
OF WEEKS WE HOPE THAT WILL BE

01:16:31.687 --> 01:16:34.523
ONLINE BY JANUARY OF TWENTY

01:16:34.589 --> 01:16:35.090
TWENTY TWO WITH THE U. S.

01:16:35.157 --> 01:16:37.192
DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY CONVERSION

01:16:37.259 --> 01:16:39.094
PLANT AGAIN BOTH DEMONSTRATION

01:16:39.161 --> 01:16:43.065
PLANTS ONLINE BY LATE TWENTY

01:16:43.131 --> 01:16:43.565
TWENTY TWO. IF THOSE ARE

01:16:43.632 --> 01:16:47.102
SUCCESSFUL- WILL THEN BEGIN.

01:16:47.169 --> 01:16:48.770
COLLECTING DATA PART OF THE

01:16:48.837 --> 01:16:50.539
DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY GRANT ALSO

01:16:50.605 --> 01:16:52.674
COVERS. THE DEVELOPMENT OF FULL

01:16:52.741 --> 01:16:55.243
SCALE COMMERCIAL ENGINEERING

01:16:55.310 --> 01:16:57.546
AND THE LIKE SO WE COULD BEGIN

01:16:57.612 --> 01:17:00.649
CONSTRUCTION AS AS EARLY AS

01:17:00.716 --> 01:17:01.216
TWENTY TWENTY FOUR BUT WE'VE

01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:02.184
GOT TO DO THE ENGINEERING AND

01:17:02.250 --> 01:17:04.920
PERMITTING- AND GOT TO MAKE

01:17:04.987 --> 01:17:06.288
SURE THAT YOU KNOW THIS WORKS.

01:17:06.355 --> 01:17:07.656
WE CAN TALK ABOUT JOB CREATION

01:17:07.723 --> 01:17:09.124
LATER BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT WILL

01:17:09.191 --> 01:17:12.127
ALSO BE ARE QUITE SIGNIFICANT.

01:17:12.194 --> 01:17:15.797
SO- WE- WE THINK THAT

01:17:15.864 --> 01:17:17.332
SUCCESSFUL LITHIUM PRODUCTION

01:17:17.399 --> 01:17:19.735
CAN ALSO BE A CATALYST. TO

01:17:19.801 --> 01:17:22.904
pINDUSTRY SO WE'RE NOT JUST

01:17:22.971 --> 01:17:24.840
CREATING JOBS AND WITH THEM.

01:17:24.906 --> 01:17:26.808
BUT ALSO REDUCING THE PRICE OF

01:17:26.875 --> 01:17:29.144
GEOTHERMAL POWER IN A WAY WITH

01:17:29.211 --> 01:17:31.113
THEM CAN BE THE TAIL THAT WAGS

01:17:31.179 --> 01:17:34.116
THE GEOTHERMAL DAHLE. TO BE

01:17:34.182 --> 01:17:35.617
QUITE FRANK. GEOTHERMAL POWER

01:17:35.684 --> 01:17:37.586
CAN'T COME RIGHT NOW FOR COST

01:17:37.652 --> 01:17:39.087
WITH WIND AND SOLAR IT'S GOT TO

01:17:39.154 --> 01:17:40.622
RIFIC ATTRIBUTES ITS BASELOAD

01:17:40.689 --> 01:17:42.057
AS YOU HEARD IT CAN EASILY

01:17:42.124 --> 01:17:43.959
REPLACE DIABLO CANYON WHICH

01:17:44.026 --> 01:17:45.994
WIND AND SOLAR FARM CAN'T DO.

01:17:46.061 --> 01:17:47.696
BUT IT'S SIMPLY MORE EXPENSIVE

01:17:47.763 --> 01:17:49.698
IF YOU CAN GET THAT SECONDARY

01:17:49.765 --> 01:17:51.066
STREAM OF INCOME GOING FROM

01:17:51.133 --> 01:17:52.801
LITHIUM YOU CAN REDUCE THE COST

01:17:52.868 --> 01:17:55.537
OF THAT GEOTHERMAL POWER SO. WE

01:17:55.604 --> 01:17:57.172
SEE A LOT OF SYNERGIES HERE

01:17:57.239 --> 01:18:00.509
JUST WITH LOCAL BENEFITS AND

01:18:00.575 --> 01:18:02.277
OPPORTUNITIES TO REALLY EVEN

01:18:02.344 --> 01:18:04.813
GROW THE GEO THERMAL- INDUSTRY

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:06.515
IN IMPERIAL VALLEY WHICH IN

01:18:06.581 --> 01:18:08.016
TURN CAN GREW THE LITHIUM

01:18:08.083 --> 01:18:11.386
INDUSTRY. NOW BARRIERS RISKS

01:18:11.453 --> 01:18:12.421
LET ME GO THROUGH THOSE

01:18:12.487 --> 01:18:14.089
QUICKLY. WE'VE REALLY GOT TO DE

01:18:14.156 --> 01:18:16.258
RISK THREE THINGS WE GOT TO THE

01:18:16.324 --> 01:18:17.159
REST OF THE TECHNOLOGY WE'VE

01:18:17.225 --> 01:18:18.427
GOT TO DE RISK THE PRODUCTION

01:18:18.493 --> 01:18:20.295
OF THE LITHIUM AND WE WANT TO

01:18:20.362 --> 01:18:21.930
DE RISK THE MARKET. SO DE

01:18:21.997 --> 01:18:23.398
RISKING THE TECHNOLOGY PRETTY

01:18:23.465 --> 01:18:26.301
MUCH COVER THAT WE NEED TO SEE

01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:28.470
ISN'T TECHNICALLY COMMERCIALLY

01:18:28.537 --> 01:18:31.273
FEASIBLE TO RELIABLY EXTRACT

01:18:31.339 --> 01:18:32.174
REAL LIFTING HIM FROM THIS

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:34.242
BRIAN IN AN ENVIRONMENTALLY

01:18:34.309 --> 01:18:35.977
RESPONSIBLE WAY. SO THAT'S

01:18:36.044 --> 01:18:36.812
THREE PARTS RIGHT THERE THE

01:18:36.878 --> 01:18:38.647
TECHNICAL THE COMMERCIAL AND

01:18:38.713 --> 01:18:39.815
THE ENVIRONMENT AND WITH THE

01:18:39.881 --> 01:18:41.383
SENATE ANY ENERGY COMMISSION

01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:42.484
GRANT WE'VE GOT TO DO THAT FOR

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:44.486
UNDER THREE FOUR THOUSAND.

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:46.488
DOLLARS A TON. WE'VE GOT PROOF

01:18:46.555 --> 01:18:48.223
PROOF OF CONCEPT WE'RE ON OUR%

01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:50.692
WAY SO LET'S GO TO DE RISKING

01:18:50.759 --> 01:18:53.228
THE PRODUCTION. ARE THE LAST

01:18:53.295 --> 01:18:54.696
GEOTHERMAL PLANT WE PERMITTED

01:18:54.763 --> 01:18:56.631
TOOK FOUR YEARS TO DESIGN AND

01:18:56.698 --> 01:18:59.000
PERMIT- WE CAN'T TAKE THAT LONG

01:18:59.067 --> 01:19:01.403
I MEAN A KEY OBSTACLE HERE WILL

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:03.271
BE NEEDED GOVERNMENT APPROVAL

01:19:03.338 --> 01:19:05.373
WHICH- WE HOPE WE CAN EXPEDITE

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:07.476
THAT PROCESS. THERE'S NO

01:19:07.542 --> 01:19:09.010
QUESTION THE COMMUNITY SUPPORT

01:19:09.077 --> 01:19:10.579
AND EARLY ENGAGEMENT WILL

01:19:10.645 --> 01:19:13.048
REDUCE POTENTIAL OPPOSITION

01:19:13.115 --> 01:19:15.016
POTENTIAL DELAYS AS WELL AS

01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:16.451
STATE AN INTERAGENCY

01:19:16.518 --> 01:19:18.620
COOPERATION AND STREAMLINING

01:19:18.687 --> 01:19:20.755
WOULD CLEARLY SPEED UP THAT

01:19:20.822 --> 01:19:22.757
PROCESS. I DO WANT TO SAY ON

01:19:22.824 --> 01:19:24.226
COMMUNITY OUTREACH WE HAVE

01:19:24.292 --> 01:19:25.460
ALREADY HELD ONE VIRTUAL TOWN

01:19:25.527 --> 01:19:27.295
HALL MEETING BACK IN MARCH WE

01:19:27.362 --> 01:19:28.630
HAD OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:19:28.697 --> 01:19:30.565
ATTENDEES WE HAD OTHER

01:19:30.632 --> 01:19:32.434
MEETINGS. I ACTUALLY UNDER YOUR

01:19:32.501 --> 01:19:36.771
AUSPICES. MISTER CHAIRMAN WITH

01:19:36.838 --> 01:19:37.939
SOME OTHER IN FIREMEN JUSTICE

01:19:38.006 --> 01:19:39.774
GROUP. AND WE INTO TO HOLD A-

01:19:39.841 --> 01:19:42.177
PUBLIC- TOWN MEETING JULY. AND

01:19:42.244 --> 01:19:43.778
WOULD HOPE. INVITE AS MANY AS

01:19:43.845 --> 01:19:46.047
WE TO COME. OTHER DE RISKING

01:19:46.114 --> 01:19:48.016
THEIR WORK THAT GREAT WORKFORCE.

01:19:48.083 --> 01:19:49.584
WE'RE ALREADY WORKING WITH

01:19:49.651 --> 01:19:50.719
IMPERIAL COUNTY COLLEGE ON

01:19:50.785 --> 01:19:52.921
CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT WE NEED

01:19:52.988 --> 01:19:54.589
TO WORK ON INCENTIVES

01:19:54.656 --> 01:19:56.525
OPPORTUNITY ZONES ENTERPRISE

01:19:56.591 --> 01:19:59.594
ZONES LOTS OF DIFFERENT CREDITS

01:19:59.661 --> 01:20:00.195
BOTH AT THE STATE AND FEDERAL

01:20:00.262 --> 01:20:02.697
LEVEL. AND LASTLY WE'VE GOT TO

01:20:02.764 --> 01:20:04.933
WORK- ON ANCILLARY ISSUES- ROAD

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.701
IMPROVEMENTS THINGS THAT YOU

01:20:06.768 --> 01:20:07.602
KNOW ARE THAT THAT WILL THAT

01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:09.237
WILL MAKE THIS WORK BROADBAND

01:20:09.304 --> 01:20:10.839
IMPROVEMENT- DOWN IN THAT AREA

01:20:10.906 --> 01:20:12.340
THAT WILL HELP ATTRACT THE WORK

01:20:12.407 --> 01:20:14.476
FORCE. AND THEN THAT THIRD DE

01:20:14.543 --> 01:20:16.611
RISKING YES WE GOTTA DO RISK

01:20:16.678 --> 01:20:18.580
THE MARKET- THESE ARE LONG TERM

01:20:18.647 --> 01:20:21.116
CONTRACTS WE NEED TO MAKE CLEAR

01:20:21.183 --> 01:20:24.152
THAT CALIFORNIA IS ON THE MAP

01:20:24.219 --> 01:20:26.421
FOR LITHIUM PRODUCTION- THIS

01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:28.823
THIS COMMITTEE IS GREAT- TO DO

01:20:28.890 --> 01:20:30.125
THAT THE LITHIUM VALLEY

01:20:30.192 --> 01:20:31.359
COMMISSION I THINK IS DOING

01:20:31.426 --> 01:20:33.261
THAT. I WOULD LOVE GOVERNOR

01:20:33.328 --> 01:20:35.230
NEWSOM TO LEAD A REVERSE TRADE

01:20:35.297 --> 01:20:37.532
MISSION BRING IN OFF TAKERS TO

01:20:37.599 --> 01:20:39.634
SHOW WHAT WE CAN DO AND MIND

01:20:39.701 --> 01:20:42.437
YOU WE'RE COMPETING HERE I MEAN

01:20:42.504 --> 01:20:43.405
THERE IS A THERE'S A RACE

01:20:43.471 --> 01:20:46.541
RIGHT. FOR LITHIUM AND IT'S NOT

01:20:46.608 --> 01:20:48.176
JUST AROUND THE WORLD WITH AS

01:20:48.243 --> 01:20:48.944
YOU HEARD FROM CHAIRMAN HOPE

01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:50.645
SHE'LL IT'S NOT JUST SOUTH

01:20:50.712 --> 01:20:52.347
AMERICA AUSTRALIA AND CHINA

01:20:52.414 --> 01:20:53.481
IT'S NOW GERMANY IT'S NOW THE

01:20:53.548 --> 01:20:55.850
UNITED KINGDOM AND IN THE

01:20:55.917 --> 01:20:57.485
UNITED STATES AS YOU HEARD

01:20:57.552 --> 01:20:59.854
ALREADY NEVADA. ARKANSAS NORTH

01:20:59.921 --> 01:21:02.657
CAROLINA SO THERE'S A LOT TO DO

01:21:02.724 --> 01:21:03.959
HERE LET ME JUST SUM UP AND

01:21:04.025 --> 01:21:04.526
THEN DELIGHTED TO TAKE

01:21:04.593 --> 01:21:06.428
QUESTIONS BUT- ONE OF THE

01:21:06.494 --> 01:21:08.863
QUESTIONS THAT WAS ASKED WHY

01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:12.734
YOU KNOW WHY LITHIUM VALLEY.

01:21:12.801 --> 01:21:14.302
WHAT THE- FOR AND FOREMOST IT'S

01:21:14.369 --> 01:21:16.905
THE OBVIOUS ONE THE- IS. OF

01:21:16.972 --> 01:21:18.907
WE'RE OR NAY. THE O. FOR POWER

01:21:18.974 --> 01:21:21.109
WE'RE LOOKING AT A- ON CHECK.

01:21:21.176 --> 01:21:22.844
JUST PRECIPITATE OUT WITH THE

01:21:22.911 --> 01:21:25.880
IS AS CHAIRMAN OF DISK.

01:21:25.947 --> 01:21:27.749
SECONDLY WE TERM SUPPLY THERE'S

01:21:27.816 --> 01:21:28.783
A LEAST A SEVENTY FIVE YEAR

01:21:28.850 --> 01:21:31.319
SUPPLY PROP. LONG AND IT'S PROP

01:21:31.386 --> 01:21:34.222
THE LARGEST. LITHIUM RESERVOIR

01:21:34.289 --> 01:21:36.324
IN THE WORLD. SCIENTISTS ARE

01:21:36.391 --> 01:21:38.860
WORKING ON THAT AS WELL. NUMBER

01:21:38.927 --> 01:21:39.661
THREE THERE THERE IS A WATER

01:21:39.728 --> 01:21:41.263
NEED AND BE DELIGHTED TO

01:21:41.329 --> 01:21:44.132
ADDRESS THAT- IN ID IS AWARE OF

01:21:44.199 --> 01:21:45.367
THAT THERE THERE WILL BE A

01:21:45.433 --> 01:21:47.602
WATER NEED ON THE PURIFICATION.

01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:49.404
OF THAT. ION EXCHANGE

01:21:49.471 --> 01:21:51.873
TECHNOLOGY- THERE'S A GROWING

01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:53.174
SHIFT TO ELECTRIC VEHICLE

01:21:53.241 --> 01:21:55.176
PRODUCTION SO IN NORTH AMERICAN

01:21:55.243 --> 01:21:57.245
A RELIABLE NORTH AMERICAN

01:21:57.312 --> 01:22:00.048
SUPPLY. OF A CRITICAL ELEMENT

01:22:00.115 --> 01:22:01.683
LIKE LITHIUM- IS

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:02.784
EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT IN

01:22:02.851 --> 01:22:04.819
FACT. I WOULD ARGUE THERE'S

01:22:04.886 --> 01:22:05.654
EVEN A NATIONAL SECURITY

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:07.656
CONCERN HERE ABOUT THE NEED TO

01:22:07.722 --> 01:22:09.291
PRODUCE LITHIUM WHICH AS YOU

01:22:09.357 --> 01:22:11.259
SAID MISTER CHAIR. WE'VE ONLY

01:22:11.326 --> 01:22:12.360
PRODUCED WOULD PRODUCE A TINY

01:22:12.427 --> 01:22:14.696
BIT. NUMBER FIVE THE LOGISTICAL

01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:16.164
ADVANTAGE YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT

01:22:16.231 --> 01:22:17.465
THAT FOR SOUTHERNCALIFORNIA.

01:22:17.532 --> 01:22:20.168
AND LASTLY THIS WILL BE THE

01:22:20.235 --> 01:22:21.736
MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY

01:22:21.803 --> 01:22:23.471
RESPONSIBLE LITHIUM PRODUCTION

01:22:23.538 --> 01:22:26.474
IN THE WORLD ALREADY WE RETURN

01:22:26.541 --> 01:22:27.709
ERROR UNUSED BRIAN IT'S

01:22:27.776 --> 01:22:29.377
RECYCLED ITS RETURN TO THE

01:22:29.444 --> 01:22:31.279
RESERVOIR. WE WILL BE TAKING

01:22:31.346 --> 01:22:32.847
OUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PARTS PER

01:22:32.914 --> 01:22:34.549
MILLION OF LITHIUM- IT'S A

LITTLE SUBTLE DIFFERENCES BUT I

01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:28.742
THINK THERE'S A COMMON THEME-

01:37:28.809 --> 01:37:31.345
HERE WITH WITH GEOTHERMAL-

01:37:31.412 --> 01:37:33.914
BRIAN AS A AS A CERTAINLY AT AN

01:37:33.981 --> 01:37:35.282
ENVIRONMENTAL ADVANTAGE OVER

01:37:35.349 --> 01:37:35.816
THE CURRENT STATE OF THE

01:37:35.883 --> 01:37:37.785
INDUSTRY. A LITTLE BACKGROUND

01:37:37.851 --> 01:37:39.853
ON ENERGY SOURCE MINERALS-

01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:40.588
WE'RE BASED IN SOUTHERN

01:37:40.654 --> 01:37:43.023
CALIFORNIA- WE HAVE OPERATING

01:37:43.090 --> 01:37:43.591
PERSONNEL HERE IN IMPERIAL

01:37:43.657 --> 01:37:46.260
COUNTY- AS WELL AS SOME FOLKS

01:37:46.327 --> 01:37:49.163
IN IN SAN DIEGO- WE WERE THE

01:37:49.230 --> 01:37:51.131
DEVELOPER OF. THE U. S.

01:37:51.198 --> 01:37:53.033
GEOTHERMAL FACILITY DOWN HERE

01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:53.667
IN THE SOUTH AND SEE THAT'S THE

01:37:53.734 --> 01:37:55.369
FEATHER STONE PLANT. WE

01:37:55.436 --> 01:37:56.270
CONTINUE TO OPERATE THAT

01:37:56.337 --> 01:37:59.573
FACILITY. AND WE'VE ADDED- YOU

01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:01.508

01:38:01.575 --> 01:38:03.577
OUR DEVELOPING- YOU KNOW WHAT

01:38:03.644 --> 01:38:05.346
WE BELIEVE WILL BE THE FIRST

01:38:05.412 --> 01:38:07.014
PROJECT TO COMMERCIAL EXTRACT

01:38:07.081 --> 01:38:08.582
WITH HIM FROM THAT GEOTHERMAL

01:38:08.649 --> 01:38:13.287
BRINE. I THINK- BY JONATHAN

01:38:13.354 --> 01:38:15.189
ROSS TOUCHED ON THIS AND PM G.

01:38:15.256 --> 01:38:17.258
OF THE RYAN IS NEW- IT IS

01:38:17.324 --> 01:38:18.459
COMPETE AND A GLOBAL GLOBAL

01:38:18.525 --> 01:38:19.627
MARKET PLACE BUT I THINK THE

01:38:19.693 --> 01:38:21.662
TECHNOLOGY- THERE ARE

01:38:21.729 --> 01:38:23.063
DIFFERENCES I THINK BETWEEN

01:38:23.130 --> 01:38:24.331
WHAT WE'RE PURSUING BUT I THINK

01:38:24.398 --> 01:38:28.168
IT. AS A WHOLE- THIS WILL BE-

01:38:28.235 --> 01:38:30.304
THE CLEANEST LITHIUM- AND

01:38:30.371 --> 01:38:32.673
CERTAINLY OUR PROCESS WE'VE PUT

01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:35.175
IT UP AGAINST- YOU KNOW THE

01:38:35.242 --> 01:38:37.544
OTHER RESOURCES THROUGH. AN

01:38:37.611 --> 01:38:40.948
INDEPENDENT STUDY- AND SO I'LL

01:38:41.015 --> 01:38:42.049
SPEAK TO THAT HERE IN JUST A

01:38:42.116 --> 01:38:43.250
SECOND BUT IS PART OF THIS

01:38:43.317 --> 01:38:44.318
PROCESS I THINK ONE OF THE

01:38:44.385 --> 01:38:45.853
THINGS THAT'S THAT'S INHERENT

01:38:45.919 --> 01:38:47.454
AND ONE OF THE REAL ADVANTAGES

01:38:47.521 --> 01:38:49.423
EVEN THOUGH WE ARE EXTRACTING.

01:38:49.490 --> 01:38:51.125
A HUGE AMOUNT OF THERMAL ENERGY

01:38:51.191 --> 01:38:53.494
OUT OF THE BRIAN TODAY- THERE'S

01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:55.262
STILL A LOT OF ENERGY IN THAT

01:38:55.329 --> 01:38:56.497
AND THAT REALLY DOES HELP DRIVE

01:38:56.563 --> 01:38:59.366
TO. THE THE LITHIUM RECOVERY

01:38:59.433 --> 01:39:00.200
PROCESS AND IT MAKES IT MORE

01:39:00.267 --> 01:39:02.569
EFFICIENT- IF YOU'VE BEEN OUT

01:39:02.636 --> 01:39:03.771
HERE AND HAVE YOU BEEN OUT HERE

01:39:03.837 --> 01:39:04.872
YOU RECOGNIZE IT'S A PRETTY

01:39:04.938 --> 01:39:07.541
SMALL- PROJECT FOOTPRINT- AND

01:39:07.608 --> 01:39:10.544
IN FACT THE- THE WELL HEAD-

01:39:10.611 --> 01:39:12.346
THAT PAT IS GENERALLY ABOUT.

01:39:12.413 --> 01:39:14.481
YOU KNOW FIVE ACRES OR LESS SO

01:39:14.548 --> 01:39:16.050
YOU KNOW THE PICTURES- THE

01:39:16.116 --> 01:39:17.518
DESCRIPTION IN OR YOU HAVE AN

01:39:17.584 --> 01:39:19.253
OPEN PIT MINE THAT SEVERAL

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:21.055
THOUSAND ACRES- AND EVAPORATION

01:39:21.121 --> 01:39:23.023
POND THAT'S YOU KNOW. ON THE

01:39:23.090 --> 01:39:24.792
ORDER OF MAGNITUDE OF YOU KNOW.

01:39:24.858 --> 01:39:26.293
YEAH FIFTY A HUNDRED SQUARE

01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:30.497
MILES- YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE

01:39:30.564 --> 01:39:30.998
TALKING ABOUT VERY SMALL

01:39:31.065 --> 01:39:32.966
FOOTPRINT- WHAT. WHAT I THINK

01:39:33.033 --> 01:39:34.702
YOU'VE ALSO HEARD AND I'LL ECHO

01:39:34.768 --> 01:39:37.004
THIS IS ONE OF. THE SALTON SEA

01:39:37.071 --> 01:39:38.439
IS ONE OF THESE RARE RESOURCES

01:39:38.505 --> 01:39:40.474
IN THE WORLD. WHERE YOU HAVE

01:39:40.541 --> 01:39:41.942
GEOTHERMAL BRINE AND

01:39:42.009 --> 01:39:44.645
COMMERCIALLY. VIABLE QUANTITY

01:39:44.712 --> 01:39:45.813
OF LITHIUM AND THAT THAT JUST

01:39:45.879 --> 01:39:47.081
DOESN'T EXIST IN A LOT OF

01:39:47.147 --> 01:39:48.349
PLACES SO THERE UNITS

01:39:48.415 --> 01:39:49.416
CALIFORNIA'S EXTREMELY

01:39:49.483 --> 01:39:51.085
FORTUNATE AND I THINK IT'S AN

01:39:51.151 --> 01:39:53.821
OPPORTUNITY- FOR US HERE TO

01:39:53.887 --> 01:39:55.622
ENERGY SOURCE MINERALS TO WHAT

01:39:55.689 --> 01:39:56.256
I THINK MAKE IS THE MOST

01:39:56.323 --> 01:39:57.725
SUSTAINABLE. AND

01:39:57.791 --> 01:39:59.460
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY METHOD

01:39:59.526 --> 01:40:02.763
OF MINING- LITHIUM SO WE

01:40:02.830 --> 01:40:04.598
COMMISSION AN INDEPENDENT LIFE

01:40:04.665 --> 01:40:07.134
CYCLE ASSESSMENT AND I THINK- A

01:40:07.201 --> 01:40:09.236
LOT OF YOU WILL APPRECIATE.

01:40:09.303 --> 01:40:12.673
THAT YOU KNOW THE TRANSITION TO

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:15.776
ELECTRIFICATION- YOU KNOW IS

01:40:15.843 --> 01:40:18.979
INHERENTLY. A NET POSITIVE BUT

01:40:19.046 --> 01:40:21.382
AT THE END- PRODUCT USERS ARE

01:40:21.448 --> 01:40:23.117
ALSO LOOKING FOR YOU KNOW AN

01:40:23.183 --> 01:40:24.518
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT GOES INTO

01:40:24.585 --> 01:40:25.953
ALL OF THEIR PRODUCTS AND

01:40:26.019 --> 01:40:26.453
WHAT'S THAT WHAT'S THE

01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:28.222
FOOTPRINT OF THAT WAS. SO WE

01:40:28.288 --> 01:40:29.523
COMMISSION AN INDEPENDENT

01:40:29.590 --> 01:40:31.291
ASSESSMENT AND WE LOOK AT-

01:40:31.358 --> 01:40:32.493
PARTICULARLY GREENHOUSE GAS

01:40:32.559 --> 01:40:35.696
EMISSIONS WATER USE AND THESE

01:40:35.763 --> 01:40:36.997
LAND REQUIREMENTS. IN OUR

01:40:37.064 --> 01:40:40.701
APPROACH SPECIFICALLY- YOU KNOW

01:40:40.768 --> 01:40:42.403
WE'VE WE SPENT A LOT OF YEARS

01:40:42.469 --> 01:40:44.705
DOING OUR OUR PILOT WORK. OF

01:40:44.772 --> 01:40:47.608
ENGINEERING AND- YOU KNOW WHEN

01:40:47.674 --> 01:40:49.676
YOU LOOK AT THE ADMISSION RATES-

01:40:49.743 --> 01:40:52.146
FROM OUR PROJECT- UP AGAINST

01:40:52.212 --> 01:40:53.347
THESE HARD ROCK RESOURCES WERE

01:40:53.414 --> 01:40:57.017
ABOUT 90% LOWER SO FULL ORDER

01:40:57.084 --> 01:40:57.484
OF MAGNITUDE LOWER ON

01:40:57.551 --> 01:40:59.953
EMISSIONS- WE LOOK AT WATER

01:41:00.020 --> 01:41:02.723
USE- IT'S THE SAME. YOU KNOW A

01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:04.591
FULL ORDER OF MAGNITUDE AND A

01:41:04.658 --> 01:41:07.394
90% REDUCTION COMPARED TO

01:41:07.461 --> 01:41:09.329
EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES. AND

01:41:09.396 --> 01:41:11.465
THEN- WHEN WE LOOK AT AND

01:41:11.532 --> 01:41:14.001
COMPARE OURSELVES TO SOME OTHER-

01:41:14.067 --> 01:41:15.235
SELECTIVE LITHIUM EXTRACTION

01:41:15.302 --> 01:41:18.272
TECHNOLOGIES- WE HAVE A

01:41:18.338 --> 01:41:19.873
TECHNIQUE AND A METHOD THAT'S

01:41:19.940 --> 01:41:21.508
THAT'S EXTREMELY EFFICIENT WITH

01:41:21.575 --> 01:41:25.412
RESPECT TO- THAT WATER USE- AS

01:41:25.479 --> 01:41:27.881
WELL AS REAGENT CONSUMPTION AND

01:41:27.948 --> 01:41:30.784
ENERGY. AND SO- YOU KNOW I

01:41:30.851 --> 01:41:33.687
THINK THE MESSAGE HERE YOU KNOW

01:41:33.754 --> 01:41:35.322
I SORT OF ECHOES THE GROUP BUT

01:41:35.389 --> 01:41:36.590
ALSO TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER AND

01:41:36.657 --> 01:41:38.559
SAY YOU KNOW WE FOUND A WAY TO

01:41:38.625 --> 01:41:40.627
MAKE THIS IS JUST AS EFFICIENT.

01:41:40.694 --> 01:41:41.929
AS POSSIBLE AND I THINK THAT'S

01:41:41.995 --> 01:41:43.430
REALLY IMPORTANT- BOTH

01:41:43.497 --> 01:41:44.331
ECONOMICALLY BUT

01:41:44.398 --> 01:41:45.566
ENVIRONMENTALLY YOU KNOW YOU

01:41:45.632 --> 01:41:47.868
HAVE A PROCESS THAT'S IT'S GOT

01:41:47.935 --> 01:41:52.673
THE YOU KNOW THE LOWEST INPUTS-

01:41:52.739 --> 01:41:53.207
POSSIBLE PARTICULARLY WITH

01:41:53.273 --> 01:41:55.576
RESPECT TO ENERGY. SO AGAIN I

01:41:55.642 --> 01:41:56.844
YOU KNOW I CAN'T EMPHASIZE THAT

01:41:56.910 --> 01:41:59.480
YOU KNOW THIRTY ACRE PROJECT

01:41:59.546 --> 01:42:01.748
SIZE YOU KNOW VERSUS A HARD

01:42:01.815 --> 01:42:03.450
ROCK OPERATION IT MIGHT BE

01:42:03.517 --> 01:42:05.285
THREE THOUSAND ACRES OR UPON

01:42:05.352 --> 01:42:07.855
EVAPORATION PROCESS LIKE THOSE

01:42:07.921 --> 01:42:09.289
IN SOUTH AMERICA WHICH WOULD BE

01:42:09.356 --> 01:42:10.390
YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THIRTY

01:42:10.457 --> 01:42:13.760
THOUSAND. ACRES OR MORE SO.

01:42:13.827 --> 01:42:15.028
YEAH WE DEFINITELY AGREE

01:42:15.095 --> 01:42:15.796
ELECTRIFICATION OF

01:42:15.863 --> 01:42:17.331
TRANSPORTATION CAN DELIVER SOME

01:42:17.397 --> 01:42:19.299
REAL ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS TO

01:42:19.366 --> 01:42:21.001
QUIT THAT POWER IS RENEWABLE

01:42:21.068 --> 01:42:22.069
LIKE WE HAVE YOUR RIGID

01:42:22.135 --> 01:42:23.904
THERMAL. AND IF THOSE BATTERY

01:42:23.971 --> 01:42:25.639
MATERIAL FEEDSTOCKS ARE SOURCED

01:42:25.706 --> 01:42:26.673
FROM THE MOST SUSTAINABLE

01:42:26.740 --> 01:42:28.141
RESOURCE TYPE AND WE BELIEVE

01:42:28.208 --> 01:42:30.177
THAT'S GEOTHERMAL. LITHIUM AND

01:42:30.244 --> 01:42:31.345
IT LEADS YOU KNOW I THINK IN

01:42:31.411 --> 01:42:33.847
EVERY ENVIRONMENTAL METRIC YOU

01:42:33.914 --> 01:42:35.616
KNOW BY HEAD AND SHOULDERS. BUT

01:42:35.682 --> 01:42:37.718
OTHERS HAVE ECHOED IT- LEVINE

01:42:37.784 --> 01:42:38.886
IS GLOBALLY COMPETITIVE WE'RE

01:42:38.952 --> 01:42:40.621
COMPETING ON PRICE WE'RE

01:42:40.687 --> 01:42:42.523
COMPETING ON PRODUCT QUALITY.

01:42:42.589 --> 01:42:46.126
BATTERY CPAC WITHIN HYDROXIDE

01:42:46.193 --> 01:42:49.463
OR LITHIUM CARBONATE- IS NOT A

01:42:49.530 --> 01:42:51.265
COMMODITY CHEMICAL LIKE SOME

01:42:51.331 --> 01:42:52.566
MIGHT HAVE YOU BELIEVE IT IS

01:42:52.633 --> 01:42:55.802
IT'S A VERY BESPOKE- PRODUCT.

01:42:55.869 --> 01:42:58.739
AND IT'S VERY HARD TO MAKE- IT

01:42:58.805 --> 01:42:59.606
REQUIRES A LOT OF QUALITY

01:42:59.673 --> 01:43:01.642
CONTROL. AND YOU KNOW WE'RE

01:43:01.708 --> 01:43:03.176
COMPETING WITH FOLKS THAT YOU

01:43:03.243 --> 01:43:04.912
KNOW WE HAVE VARIOUS SHADES OF

01:43:04.978 --> 01:43:06.680
ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTER AND SO

01:43:06.747 --> 01:43:09.349
IT'S- IT'S DEFINITELY

01:43:09.416 --> 01:43:13.020
CHALLENGING MARKET. AND ONE

01:43:13.086 --> 01:43:13.654
WHERE YOU COMPETING ON ON EVERY

01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:15.188
METRIC. MANY OF YOU KNOW IT

01:43:15.255 --> 01:43:16.323
WILL COME A SURPRISE YOU KNOW

01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:17.858
CONSTRUCTION COSTS OPERATING

01:43:17.925 --> 01:43:19.126
COSTS IN THE US ARE GOING TO BE

01:43:19.192 --> 01:43:20.360
HIGHER THAN MUCH OF THE WORLD.

01:43:20.427 --> 01:43:24.598
pAND IN CALIFORNIA. SO WE LOOK

01:43:24.665 --> 01:43:25.432
AT IT YOU KNOW THAT THAT JUST

01:43:25.499 --> 01:43:26.833
PUTS AN EXTRA CHALLENGE ON US

01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:28.201
TO BE AS EFFICIENT AS WE CAN

01:43:28.268 --> 01:43:29.903
AND THAT'S RELATED TO ENERGY

01:43:29.970 --> 01:43:32.372
RELATES TO WATER. UTILIZING THE

01:43:32.439 --> 01:43:34.441
MOST EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGIES AND

01:43:34.508 --> 01:43:36.276
GETTING THE LITHIUM RECOVERY IS

01:43:36.343 --> 01:43:37.911
AS HIGH AS WE CAN FROM A FROM A

01:43:37.978 --> 01:43:40.280
GIVEN PROJECT AND SO. THAT'S

01:43:40.347 --> 01:43:41.515
THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S THE

01:43:41.582 --> 01:43:42.849
PACKAGE WE'RE BRINGING TO THE

01:43:42.916 --> 01:43:46.887
SALTON SEA- YOU KNOW TO BE SORT

01:43:46.954 --> 01:43:48.455
OF THE BEST STEWARD OF THE

01:43:48.522 --> 01:43:51.592
RESOURCE- AND PRODUCE THE BEST

01:43:51.658 --> 01:43:53.760
PRODUCT WE CAN. TO COMPETE IN A

01:43:53.827 --> 01:43:56.697
AND A AND A BALLING. YOU KNOW

01:43:56.763 --> 01:43:59.032
BATTERY MARKET- I THINK. YOU

01:43:59.099 --> 01:44:00.067
GIVE ME A SENSE OF SCALE I

01:44:00.133 --> 01:44:03.003
THINK NOMINALLY OUR PROJECT IS.

01:44:03.070 --> 01:44:03.537
TWENTY THOUSAND TONNES PER

01:44:03.604 --> 01:44:06.173
ANNUM- YOU KNOW JOHNSON

01:44:06.239 --> 01:44:07.407
SPEAKING OF THEIR THEIR

01:44:07.474 --> 01:44:09.610
FACILITIES ARE. YOU KNOW ORDER

01:44:09.676 --> 01:44:11.478
MAGAZINE MAYBE ABOUT SIX TIMES

01:44:11.545 --> 01:44:13.213
THE BRIAN SO BRIAN FLOWING

01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:15.682
TODAY'S YOU KNOW WELL OVER A

01:44:15.749 --> 01:44:17.718
HUNDRED THOUSAND TIMES- FOR

01:44:17.784 --> 01:44:20.287
YEAR OF BATTERY GRADE-

01:44:20.354 --> 01:44:23.423
DILITHIUM- CARBONATE EQUIVALENT

01:44:23.490 --> 01:44:25.559
AND- YEAH THAT'S THAT'S A

01:44:25.626 --> 01:44:28.028
GLOBAL RESOURCE. TODAY BUT

01:44:28.095 --> 01:44:29.429
THOSE THOSE NUMBERS ARE YOU

01:44:29.496 --> 01:44:34.835
KNOW EXPECTED SHIP. AND DEMAND

01:44:34.901 --> 01:44:35.335
FOR LITHIUM IS YOU KNOW

01:44:35.402 --> 01:44:36.970
INCREASING. YOU KNOW TO WELL

01:44:37.037 --> 01:44:39.072
OVER A MILLION TONS BY THE

01:44:39.139 --> 01:44:41.508
TWENTY. TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY

01:44:41.575 --> 01:44:43.410
TWENTY TIME FRAME SO IT'S- IT'S

01:44:43.477 --> 01:44:45.612
A HUGE MARKET AND- I THINK.

01:44:45.679 --> 01:44:47.514
EVERY RESOURCE MATTERS AND I

01:44:47.581 --> 01:44:48.582
THINK IT'S A SPECIALLY TREATED

01:44:48.649 --> 01:44:50.817
GET. SOMETHING WITH HIM AND

01:44:50.884 --> 01:44:53.920
SAID THAT- RATHER THAN MAYBE

01:44:53.987 --> 01:44:55.522
REHASH SOME OF THE OTHER TOPICS

01:44:55.589 --> 01:44:57.224
BECAUSE I THINK THE FIRST YOU

01:44:57.290 --> 01:44:59.326
GUYS COVERED A LOT OF THE- THE

01:44:59.393 --> 01:45:01.328
MATERIAL WELL. I THINK IT JUST

01:45:01.395 --> 01:45:03.430
MAYBE WANT TO CLOSE HERE. BY

01:45:03.497 --> 01:45:04.931
SAYING- YOU KNOW THANK THE

01:45:04.998 --> 01:45:06.433
LEGISLATURE FOR THEIR SUPPORT

01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:08.201
FOR THE INDUSTRY THUS FAR. BACK

01:45:08.268 --> 01:45:11.204
IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN

GOVERNOR-BROWN-SIGNS-MOORLACH-DATE-SEPARATION-BILL.

01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:16.109
ALLOWING THE C. C. EACH ISSUE

01:45:16.176 --> 01:45:18.111
ITS FIRST GRANT TO PROMOTE

01:45:18.178 --> 01:45:20.347
ADVANCED LITHIUM EXTRACTION-

01:45:20.414 --> 01:45:22.215
GOVERNOR BROWN- SIGNING MESSAGE

01:45:22.282 --> 01:45:23.083
THEN ON THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:45:23.150 --> 01:45:24.818
LITHIUM EXTRACTION AND- I THINK

01:45:24.885 --> 01:45:26.820
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN MORE RIGHT-

01:45:26.887 --> 01:45:28.922
AND AS THE VALUE AND IMPORTANCE

01:45:28.989 --> 01:45:30.357
OF LOOKING AT SELLING GROUND WE

01:45:30.424 --> 01:45:31.491
WERE ONE OF THE BENEFICIARIES

01:45:31.558 --> 01:45:34.461
OF THAT IT EARLY ENGINEERING.

01:45:34.528 --> 01:45:36.430
GRANT MONIES- WE PUT THAT TO

01:45:36.496 --> 01:45:38.098
GREAT USE YOU KNOW WE'VE FULLY

01:45:38.165 --> 01:45:40.033
ENGINEERED YOU KNOW OUR

01:45:40.100 --> 01:45:42.169
FACILITY CONTINUED ADVANCE THAT

01:45:42.235 --> 01:45:44.838
THAT PROJECT- BUT IT CERTAINLY

01:45:44.905 --> 01:45:47.307
YOU KNOW HELPED US- YOU KNOW

01:45:47.374 --> 01:45:49.209
EARLY AND EARLY IN OUR EFFORT-

01:45:49.276 --> 01:45:52.312
AND WE CONTINUE TO CHECK A

01:45:52.379 --> 01:45:54.214
BAT'S SO. AGAIN I THINK

01:45:54.281 --> 01:45:56.149
IMPORTANT REALLY EMPHASIZED

01:45:56.216 --> 01:45:57.784
THAT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

01:45:57.851 --> 01:45:59.619
CALIFORNIA'S WITHIN RESOURCE.

01:45:59.686 --> 01:46:01.655
FROM THE SALTON SEA IT IS IT IS

01:46:01.722 --> 01:46:05.325
A COMPLETELY. DIFFERENT

01:46:05.392 --> 01:46:07.260
RESOURCE TYPE AND A COMPLETELY

01:46:07.327 --> 01:46:08.762
ENVIRONMENT COMPLETELY

01:46:08.829 --> 01:46:10.931
DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL. FOOT

01:46:10.997 --> 01:46:13.700
PRINT OF THAT WHAT YOU SEE FROM

BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S- YOU

01:48:35.909 --> 01:48:36.810
KNOW IT'S A TECHNIQUE THAT'S

01:48:36.877 --> 01:48:39.279
USED- IN A NUMBER OF OTHER

01:48:39.346 --> 01:48:40.780
INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS IT WOULD

01:48:40.847 --> 01:48:41.681
JUST HAPPEN TO BE TALKING

01:48:41.748 --> 01:48:43.750
ABOUT. LITHIUM HERE BUT YOU

01:48:43.817 --> 01:48:44.384
KNOW WHETHER IT'S WATER

01:48:44.451 --> 01:48:47.053
SOFTENING OR- YOU KNOW WATER

01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:48.355
TREATMENT FACILITIES OR WHAT

01:48:48.421 --> 01:48:50.290
HAVE YOU IT IT BUILDS ON THAT-

01:48:50.357 --> 01:48:52.626
THAT TECHNOLOGY BASED. I'M NOT

01:48:52.692 --> 01:48:53.360
SURE WHO MIGHT ANSWER THIS

01:48:53.426 --> 01:48:55.562
BECAUSE IT BUT LITHIUM VALLEY

01:48:55.629 --> 01:48:58.164
AS AN OVERLAY. OF THE SALTON

01:48:58.231 --> 01:49:01.434
SEA. ARE IN PERIL COUNTY. THE

01:49:01.501 --> 01:49:02.302
WHEREABOUTS IS IT

01:49:02.369 --> 01:49:03.703
GEOGRAPHICALLY BECAUSE I KNOW

01:49:03.770 --> 01:49:05.405
THEY ARE REAL WELL BUT I. URGE

01:49:05.472 --> 01:49:06.573
YOU JUST AREN'T WE COME UP WITH

01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:07.674
THE NAME AND WE'RE CALLING IT

01:49:07.741 --> 01:49:09.442
LITHIA VALLEY BECAUSE IT'S TO

01:49:09.509 --> 01:49:11.211
THE WEST TO THE EAST THE SALTON

01:49:11.278 --> 01:49:14.147
SEA. THAT THAT WAS JUST TRYING

01:49:14.214 --> 01:49:18.351
TO GET OUT OF A GEOGRAPHICAL.

01:49:18.418 --> 01:49:19.085
MAP IN MY MIND ON THAT ONE. I

01:49:19.152 --> 01:49:20.353
THINK I THINK WE GIVE CREDIT TO

01:49:20.420 --> 01:49:22.289
DAVID HOPE SHE'LL FOR THAT ONE-

01:49:22.355 --> 01:49:23.657
THIS WAS ORIGINALLY SORT OF A

01:49:23.723 --> 01:49:25.692
BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION. ON

01:49:25.759 --> 01:49:27.560
LITHIUM AND THEN I THINK I

01:49:27.627 --> 01:49:28.795
THINK THAT THE CHAIR GETS

01:49:28.862 --> 01:49:30.630
CREDIT FOR TURNING INTO A WITH

01:49:30.697 --> 01:49:31.998
THE ENVELOPES. IT'S THE YOU

01:49:32.065 --> 01:49:34.401
CAN'T FIND IT ON A MAP. KNOWN

01:49:34.467 --> 01:49:37.537
RISK IT IS GENERALLY AT

01:49:37.604 --> 01:49:39.706
IMPERIAL VALLEY. KELLY AREA-

01:49:39.773 --> 01:49:41.574
THE GEOTHERMAL FACILITIES THAT

01:49:41.641 --> 01:49:43.043
YOU'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT FROM

01:49:43.109 --> 01:49:45.045
THE THREE OF US. ARE LOCATED

01:49:45.111 --> 01:49:47.414
ADJACENT TO THE SALTON SEA. IN

01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:50.650
THE LOWER. SHALL EASTERN

01:49:50.717 --> 01:49:53.253
CORNER. OF THE STREET SO THAT'S

01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:55.088
PRETTY MUCH THE LITHIUM VALLEY.

01:49:55.155 --> 01:49:57.257
AREA AND I THINK. I THINK IT'S

01:49:57.324 --> 01:49:59.092

01:50:04.264 --> 01:50:06.066
OF A GOOD NAME. BUT NO IT'S NOT

01:50:06.132 --> 01:50:07.300

MARTINEZ AND I'M I'M SORRY I'M

01:51:34.554 --> 01:51:37.123
BLANKING ON THE OTHER- WHEN WE

HAD OUR VIRTUAL TOWN HOLD WE

01:51:38.958 --> 01:51:40.326
DID INVITE. OTHER TRIBAL

01:51:40.393 --> 01:51:43.163
GROUPS- I'M ACTUALLY BASED IN

01:51:43.229 --> 01:51:45.632
WASHINGTON DC AND SPEND A LOT

01:51:45.698 --> 01:51:46.800
OF TIME AT THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:51:46.866 --> 01:51:49.102
ENERGY ON CAPITOL HILL. TALKING

01:51:49.169 --> 01:51:51.471
ABOUT LITHIUM RECOVERY- BECAUSE

01:51:51.538 --> 01:51:53.640
THE TRIBAL GROUPS ARE AN

01:51:53.706 --> 01:51:55.075
IMPORTANT PART OF THAT LOCAL

01:51:55.141 --> 01:51:56.709
COMMUNITY THE TORTOISE MARTINEZ

01:51:56.776 --> 01:51:59.079
TRIBE ACTUALLY. IS LOCATED WHAT

01:51:59.145 --> 01:52:00.613
KIND OF DIAGONALLY ACROSS THE

01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:02.315
SOLVENCY IN THE NORTHWESTERN

01:52:02.382 --> 01:52:06.352
CORNER. BUT THEY ALSO HAVE.

01:52:06.419 --> 01:52:07.287
HAPPEN TO BE UNDER THE

01:52:07.353 --> 01:52:09.522
SCHULTZI- BUT ANYWAY YES

01:52:09.589 --> 01:52:10.790
THERE'S A LOT OF COMMUNITY

01:52:10.857 --> 01:52:12.192
ENGAGEMENT NOT JUST WITH THE

01:52:12.258 --> 01:52:15.662
TRIBAL GROUPS. OTHER

ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GROUPS AS

01:52:16.362 --> 01:52:17.197
WELL. THE REASON I'M ASKING IS

01:52:17.263 --> 01:52:20.333
BECAUSE- THROUGHOUT HISTORY

01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:21.501
THERE'S BEEN A DIFFERENT

01:52:21.568 --> 01:52:23.369
EXTRACT OF MINE'S DIFFERENT

01:52:23.436 --> 01:52:24.370
THINGS THAT HAVE BECAUSE-

01:52:24.437 --> 01:52:26.973
DETRIMENT ENVIRONMENTAL- HEALTH

01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:28.908
HAZARDS THOSE TYPES OF THINGS.

01:52:28.975 --> 01:52:30.110
THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:52:30.176 --> 01:52:31.311
IN THE IN THE FOREFRONT OF THE

01:52:31.377 --> 01:52:33.546
DISCUSSION. THAT WERE- DRESSING

01:52:33.613 --> 01:52:35.381
THOSE NEEDS IN THOSE CONCERNS

01:52:35.448 --> 01:52:37.684
ARE BEING HEARD- I'VE HEARD IN

01:52:37.750 --> 01:52:38.551
THE DIFFERENT PANEL

01:52:38.618 --> 01:52:40.854
DISCUSSIONS. OF HOW TECHNOLOGY

01:52:40.920 --> 01:52:43.223
HAS NOW MOVED FORWARD TO-

01:52:43.289 --> 01:52:45.258
CREATE MINIMAL EFFECT TO SOME

01:52:45.325 --> 01:52:47.393
OF THOSE- ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

01:52:47.460 --> 01:52:49.362

EQUITABLE USE OF NATURAL

02:24:11.409 --> 02:24:14.078

02:24:14.145 --> 02:24:15.480
IN NATURAL RESOURCE AND IT HAS

02:24:15.546 --> 02:24:16.948
A STRONG WORKFORCE IN ITS

02:24:17.015 --> 02:24:18.316

COMMUNITY RESPONSE HE HAS NOT

02:24:20.051 --> 02:24:22.186
BEEN A TRUE BENEFICIARY OF

02:24:22.253 --> 02:24:23.621
EXPLOITED RESOURCES. THEY HAVE

02:24:23.688 --> 02:24:24.956
BEEN FACED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL

02:24:33.564 --> 02:24:35.166
EXPONENTIALLY AS WE CONTINUE TO

02:24:35.233 --> 02:24:36.768
ADD ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF

02:24:36.834 --> 02:24:37.969
POLLUTION THAT CONTINUE TO

02:24:38.036 --> 02:24:39.604
CONTRIBUTE TO THE EXISTING POOR

02:24:39.670 --> 02:24:41.706
AIR QUALITY. WE EXPERIENCED A

02:24:41.773 --> 02:24:43.608
FRENZY A WIN BY- FEEL SOLAR

02:24:43.674 --> 02:24:44.742
ENERGY IN FACT WE WENT

02:24:44.809 --> 02:24:47.378
BACKWARDS IN A WAY AGRICULTURAL

02:24:47.445 --> 02:24:48.446
LAND THAT HAS PROVIDED JOBS

02:24:48.513 --> 02:24:51.549
LOCALLY FOR FARMWORKERS AND

02:24:56.954 --> 02:24:59.157
PRODUCE ALMOST SEE LOCAL JOBS

02:24:59.223 --> 02:25:00.224
AND DEFINITELY NO LONG TERM

02:25:00.291 --> 02:25:02.493

CREATION OF NEW INDUSTRY MATHIS

02:25:03.895 --> 02:25:05.530
HAVE TO CONSIDER ITS

02:25:05.596 --> 02:25:06.464

02:25:08.466 --> 02:25:09.967
THAT IS MOVING THE USE OF

02:25:10.034 --> 02:25:11.436
LITHIUM BONTA SAUCY SHOULD ALSO

02:25:11.502 --> 02:25:12.904
DRIVE THE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF

02:25:12.970 --> 02:25:14.172

SO MUCH FOR TAKING MY MANY IS

02:26:05.156 --> 02:26:06.290
JAMES RODRIGUEZ AYE A LIVING

02:26:06.357 --> 02:26:08.726
CATELLA. AND THE REASON THAT I

02:26:08.793 --> 02:26:09.627
DECIDED TO GIVE A PUBLIC

02:26:09.694 --> 02:26:10.895
COMMENT IS TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT

02:26:10.962 --> 02:26:15.099
MORE OF A- GENERAL- AVERAGE

02:26:15.166 --> 02:26:17.435
CITIZENS PERSPECTIVE AND TAKE

02:26:17.502 --> 02:26:18.936
ON HOW THIS CAN ACTUALLY

02:26:19.003 --> 02:26:21.439
BENEFIT OUR LOCAL AREA- MANY OF

02:26:21.506 --> 02:26:23.708
THE OTHER CALLERS HAVE. MADE A

02:26:23.774 --> 02:26:25.243
VERY VALID POINTS ON THE FACTS

02:26:25.309 --> 02:26:27.545
THAT THE AREA NEEDS TO BE ABLE

02:26:27.612 --> 02:26:29.814
TO BENEFIT FINANCIALLY-

02:26:29.881 --> 02:26:33.451
ECONOMICALLY- AND- NOT ONLY

02:26:33.518 --> 02:26:35.853
JUST WITH- AREAS THAT ARE GOING

02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:38.289
TO BE BRINGING IN MORE. JOBS

02:26:38.356 --> 02:26:41.359

ACCESS TO THE ACTUAL A PRODUCT

02:26:45.029 --> 02:26:46.430
SO THE BIGGEST THING THAT

02:26:46.497 --> 02:26:47.999
LITHIUM CAN BE USED FOR IS

02:26:48.065 --> 02:26:50.701
STORAGE- ENERGY STORAGE WHICH

02:26:50.768 --> 02:26:53.337
IS FOR BATTERIES. SO I WOULD-

02:26:53.404 --> 02:26:55.540
SUSPECTING HOPE THAT ONE OF THE

02:26:55.606 --> 02:26:59.443
MAIN GOALS WOULD BE TO PROVIDE-

02:26:59.510 --> 02:27:01.345
AND SHE LOOKED AND- STORAGE. AS

02:27:01.412 --> 02:27:04.081
WELL- SO IF THESE PROVIDERS ARE

02:27:04.148 --> 02:27:05.116
GONNA BE COMING IN AND THEY'RE

02:27:05.183 --> 02:27:07.685
GOING TO BE USING OUR AREA AND

02:27:07.752 --> 02:27:11.422
OUR SOCIAL- MEMBERS TO TRY TO

02:27:11.489 --> 02:27:14.091
CREATE A BUSINESS AND TO.

02:27:14.158 --> 02:27:15.927
BETTER THE SALTON SEA WHICH IS

02:27:15.993 --> 02:27:18.829
A GREAT GOAL- BECAUSE THAT HAS

02:27:18.896 --> 02:27:25.236
BEEN CONTRIBUTING. A THEN- IT

02:27:25.303 --> 02:27:27.238
SHOULD ALSO BENEFIT THE LOCAL

02:27:27.305 --> 02:27:28.839
AREAS BECAUSE ONE OF THE MAJOR

02:27:28.906 --> 02:27:30.908
THINGS THAT WERE ALSO SEEN THAT

02:27:30.975 --> 02:27:32.710
THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND LOCAL

02:27:32.777 --> 02:27:34.545
SENATORS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO

02:27:34.612 --> 02:27:38.916
GET. A PASS TO THE- OUTAGES OF

02:27:38.983 --> 02:27:41.719
WATER OR IF FOR ELECTRICITY SO-

02:27:41.786 --> 02:27:43.487
IT SHOULD EXTEND FURTHER THAN

02:27:43.554 --> 02:27:45.022
JUST WANTING TO BRING THESE

02:27:45.089 --> 02:27:46.757
COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN TO WORK ON

02:27:46.824 --> 02:27:49.360
THE PROJECT. BUT TO BOLSTER THE

02:27:49.427 --> 02:27:50.795
ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY'RE LIVING

02:27:50.861 --> 02:27:52.496
IN AND TO MAKE IT MORE SELF

02:27:52.563 --> 02:27:53.965
SUSTAINING SO THAT THAT GEO

02:27:54.031 --> 02:27:56.200
THERMAL ENERGY THE WATER THAT'S

02:27:56.267 --> 02:27:58.536
BEING DESALINATED AND BE

02:27:58.603 --> 02:27:59.704
CLICKING ON THAT THE ACTUALLY

02:27:59.770 --> 02:28:01.772
BEING EXTRACTED CAN BE PUT TO

02:28:01.839 --> 02:28:04.375
USE IN THIS AREA NOT JUST

02:28:04.442 --> 02:28:06.510
EXPORTED OUT OF THE AREA-

02:28:06.577 --> 02:28:08.312
THAT'S THE ONLY THING. THAT I

02:28:08.379 --> 02:28:10.548
CAN THINK OF BY LISTENING TO

02:28:10.615 --> 02:28:13.417
ALL OF THESE CONVERSATIONS AND-

02:28:13.484 --> 02:28:17.121
TYPES OF- OF THE TAKES THAT- A

02:28:17.188 --> 02:28:18.623
REGULAR AVERAGE PERSON MIGHT

02:28:18.689 --> 02:28:21.926
NOT LISTEN TO THE- A LONG.

02:28:21.993 --> 02:28:24.262
DETAILED EXPLANATION AND THAT'S

02:28:24.328 --> 02:28:26.530
KIND OF THE- GENERAL IDEA THAT

02:28:26.597 --> 02:28:28.332
I TOOK FROM WHAT IS GOING TO BE

02:28:28.399 --> 02:28:29.400
HAPPENING BRING IN A NEW

02:28:29.467 --> 02:28:32.036
INDUSTRY THAT WILL HOPEFULLY.

02:28:32.103 --> 02:28:34.338
HELP TO GENERATE THE CLEANING

02:28:34.405 --> 02:28:37.141
UP OF THE SALTON SEA WHICH IS.

02:28:37.208 --> 02:28:39.076
ALREADY NEEDED- AND TO

02:28:39.143 --> 02:28:41.045
SPEARHEAD GEO THIRD ENERGY AS

02:28:41.112 --> 02:28:43.147
WELL IN THE AREA WHICH I'VE

02:28:43.214 --> 02:28:44.348
ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT FOR

02:28:44.415 --> 02:28:46.183
PROBABLY THE LAST DECADE-

02:28:46.250 --> 02:28:48.519
BECAUSE- A LOCAL COMPANIES HAVE

02:28:48.586 --> 02:28:49.720
BEEN TRYING TO GET GEOTHERMAL

02:28:49.787 --> 02:28:52.323
ENERGY ACTIVE IN THE HALL AREAS

02:28:52.390 --> 02:28:53.891
SO- I THINK THAT THIS IS A

02:28:53.958 --> 02:28:55.526
GREAT. WAY TO INTRODUCE THE

02:28:55.593 --> 02:28:57.194
PUBLIC TO IT- BUT IT NEEDS TO

02:28:57.261 --> 02:28:59.263
BE MORE ON LAYMAN'S TERMS-

02:28:59.330 --> 02:29:01.999
BECAUSE THE BIG INDICATORS WERE

02:29:02.066 --> 02:29:03.401
THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS AND

02:29:03.467 --> 02:29:05.336
I UNDERSTAND THERE'S NEW

02:29:05.403 --> 02:29:05.936
TECHNOLOGY THAT'S GOING TO BE

02:29:06.003 --> 02:29:07.505
IMPLEMENTED. BUT WE NEED TO

02:29:07.571 --> 02:29:09.106
UNDERSTAND IT IN A LAYMAN'S

02:29:09.173 --> 02:29:11.876
TERMS PERSPECTIVE- THIS IS HOW

02:29:11.942 --> 02:29:13.511
IT CAN BENEFIT US THIS IS WHAT

02:29:13.577 --> 02:29:21.519
THESE COMPANIES HAVE. PROMISED

02:29:21.585 --> 02:29:22.420
TO. WE WILL BRING TO THE AIR TO

02:29:22.486 --> 02:29:24.355
BE. THE A- THIS IS HOW MUCH IS

02:29:24.422 --> 02:29:24.955
ACTUALLY GOING TO BENEFITS THE

02:29:25.022 --> 02:29:27.224
AIR NOT JUST JOBS BECAUSE AS WE

02:29:27.291 --> 02:29:30.027
ALL KNOW WITH PAST. MANY

02:29:30.094 --> 02:29:31.295
COMPANIES WILL. TO GET RID OF

02:29:31.362 --> 02:29:32.797
PAYING JOBS TO KEEP THE HIGH

02:29:32.863 --> 02:29:37.435
PAYING- CORPORATES OR- MORE

02:29:37.501 --> 02:29:40.171
PROPER COMING IN SO CHOI IS ONE

02:29:40.237 --> 02:29:41.906
SMALL FACTOR OF THIS IT NEEDS

02:29:41.972 --> 02:29:42.773
TO ACTUALLY ENRICH THE

02:29:42.840 --> 02:29:45.009
