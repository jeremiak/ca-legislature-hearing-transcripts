IN THE PAST YEAR- AND THE PROPOSED HERE HAS IT GOING BACK UP BUT NOT TO THE POINT OF THE REDUCTIONS THAT WERE MADE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC HIT- AND SO BEFORE WE MEN AGAIN LET ME ASK SENATORS MEN FOR TROUBLED IF YOU HAVE ANY OPENING COMMENTS SENATOR MEN. IDEA THANK YOU VERY MUCH CARE. AS A FORMER PROFESSOR MYSELF IN THE UC SYSTEM I UNDERSTAND. AND RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION CALIFORNIA I BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY IN THE CSC'S MISSION AS LAID OUT A MASTER PLAN. AT THE CSU IS REALLY THE WORKHORSE OF OUR HIGHER ED SYSTEM IS HUGE- IT'S I BELIEVE THE LARGEST HIGHER ED SYSTEM IN THE WORLD. I AND IT'S A ENORMOUS CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR WORKFORCE- IT IS A DRIVER OF OUR ECONOMY LOCALLY IN ORANGE COUNTY- AND OF COURSE ACROSS THE STATE- IS ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT AS FAR AS THE WORK FORCE NEEDS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE IMPACTS ON THE LOCAL ECONOMY- SO I GUESS- TO ECHO CHAIR LEONARD'S POINT- YEAH THIS. THAT BUDGET ARE FLAT OF OUR VALUES. OVER THE LONG RUN WE HAVE- THE WAY THAT WE'VE TREATED THE CSU'S AND NEGLECTED THEM DOES NOT SPEAK WELL ABOUT OUR STATE'S PRIVATIZATION OF HIGHER EDUCATION- I AM ALSO CONCERNED LIKE CHAIR LAYERED ABOUT THE 10% CUT THIS YEAR'S USED TOOK. IN LAST BUDGET CYCLE I WANT TO BUDGET GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES RESTORE THIS TO SOME DEGREE IT DOES NOT FULLY RESTORE THE 10% CAT. EVEN AS THE CSU'S FACE A COSTS AND- DROPS IN REVENUES DUE TO THE PANDEMIC- I APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR'S EMPHASIS ON LOWER INCOME AND- FIRST TIME FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS- BUT I AM INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE TODAY ABOUT WHY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES NOT FULLY RESTORE THE TWO HUNDRED NINETY NINE MILLION DOLLARS CUT FROM THE PAST BUDGET CYCLE- I'VE ALSO. LEARNED THAT THE C. ISSUES HAVE SIGNIFICANT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE COSTS THAT HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED OVER TIME- CSU FULLERTON AND- WHICH IS THE ONLY CSU IN ORANGE COUNTY HAS HAD ONLY ONE NEW BUILDING BUILT IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS EVEN AS THEIR ENROLLMENT HAS CLIMBED THEY'RE CURRENTLY FACING THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN FOR MAINTENANCE NEEDS- AND OF COURSE THERE INFRASTRUCTURE IS AGING. FINALLY I WANT TO ADDRESS THE TOPIC OF COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY WHICH IT MAY NOT BE SOMETHING WE WANT TO TAKE ON THIS YEAR- BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK THAT CONTENDS THAT. HAS REAL IT WAS. AS PRESS PROBLEM IN OUR STATE. I HOPE WORK FOR THIS. ON A- THE GOING FOR- AND I'D LIKE TO SEE MORE DI&lt;c.cyan&gt;- TO ADDRESS THE EQUITY&lt;/c&gt; GAP IN HIGHER EDUCATION- SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING. YOUR TESTIMONY LEARN MORE TODAY. THANK YOU AND- JUST TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM TEXTING SENATOR MEN FOR FIVE WHAT WE SAVE. THAT IT IS THE LARGEST FOUR YEAR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM IN THE WORLD AND FOR THOSE OF US THAT ARE FORMER COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRUSTEES THAT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE LARGEST HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS AND I JUST WANT.

NOT LIKE TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE- OVERALL CALM ABOUT THE BUDGET PROPOSAL GOVERNOR NUISANCE FOR THIS YEAR'S YOU RECOGNIZE THE POWERFUL ROLE ARE CLAIM STATE AFTER WE- YEAH THIS ISSUE STATE READY TO DO. MORE IN RECALL THE GO AND THE- SUPPORT AND JUST FUNDING THAT WOULD RESTORE. PRIOR CUTS CREATE JOBS INTEREST INVESTMENTS AND ENSURE WE CAN TO REDUCE GET IN PREPARES TO FOR K. DIVERSE WORK. YEAH ISSUE IS EXPERIENCING BUDGETS AS A RESULT OF THAT ONE OF THAT TWO HUNDRED NINE NINE BILL DOLLAR I'M GOING BUDGET CUTS IN THE CURRENT YEAR. WE ARE ONE OF THE VERY STATE PROGRAMS THAT RECEIVED A NINE CUT THIS. AND THAT IS NOT ALL ARE STILL FUNDED STAY ENTERPRISE PRO ARE. SUCH AS STUDENT. PARKING AND DINING. THEY HAVE REVENUE. IN EXCEEDS HUNDRED DOLLAR SINCE OF THE PANDEMIC. WELL AS A BEACON OF SO MOBILITY IN SHOCKING JOBS. THERE ARE THREE AREAS WERE WE ASK FOR IT AND- FIRST REST OF THE CUTS MAINTAIN OUR JOB.

THE STATE'S ECONOMY AND OUR STUDENTS FUTURE. SECOND THAT IS AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION IN A ONE TIME DOLLARS. ACADEMIC FACILITIES INTERNAL NEEDS. AND I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE MY COLLEAGUE NATHAN EVANS TO SHARE A FEW THOUGHTS. THANK YOU MISTER STORM AND GOOD MORNING SENATORS I AM NATHAN EVANS- CHIEF OF STAFF AND SENIOR ADVISER FOR ACADEMIC AND STUDENT AFFAIRS AT THE CSU OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR- THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TODAY. A COUPLE COMMENTS I WANTED TO SHARE SPECIFICALLY REGARDING OUR WORK TOWARD STUDENT SUCCESS- THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC CHANCELLOR EMERITUS WHITE AND NOW CHANCER CASTRO. HAVE KEPT THE UNIVERSITY SITES ON TO NORTH STARS ONE SAFEGUARDING THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF THE ENTIRE C. ISSUE COMMUNITY. AND TO ENSURING THAT AS MANY STUDENTS AS POSSIBLE STAY ON TRACK TO EARNING A PROVEN LOOK THE PROVEN LIFELONG BENEFITS OF THE CSU DEGREE. WE PLEDGE TO HOLD HOLD FIRM OUR COMMITMENT TO STUDENT SUCCESS IN EQUITY THROUGH GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND HAS BEEN CHáVEZ HAS BEEN SHARED WE ARE DEEPLY APPRECIATIVE OF GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S FUNDING PROPOSAL RECOGNIZING THE ROLE OF HIGHER EDUCATION. AND THE CSU SPECIFICALLY THAT WE PLAY IN THE STATE'S ECNOMIC RECOVERY IN THE LONG TERM SOCIAL MOBILITY OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION. THE PANDEMIC PAST MAY NEARLY ONE HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND CSU STUDENTS EARNED A BACHELOR'S DEGREE AND JOIN THE RANKS OF R. TWENTY THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION ALUMNI. THAT WAS A RECORD NUMBER OF DEGREES TWENTY THREE THOUSAND ADDITIONAL GRADUATES COMPARED TO TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE YEAR BEFORE A GRADUATION INITIATIVE LAUNCHED. AND WALL COLLECTIVELY UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE SEEN UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT DROPPED BY APPROXIMATELY 4% IN THE LAST YEAR. OUR ENROLLMENT IS A RECORD HIGH THIS ACADEMIC YEAR WE ARE PROUDLY EDUCATING THE LARGEST STUDENT BODY IN THE C. ISSUES HISTORY. AND FALL TWENTY TWENTY THAT STARTED NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS. AND PERHAPS MOST NOTABLY DURING THE COVERT PAT- NINETEEN PANDEMIC WE RECORDED OUR HIGHEST RETENTION RATE EVER WITH MORE THAN 85% OF OUR FIRST YEAR STUDENTS RETURNING TO CAMPUS AND FALL TWENTY TWENTY. FOR THEIR SECOND YEAR. AND THAT'S A TESTAMENT NOT ONLY TO OUR STUDENTS TO NOW CITY BUT ALSO THEIR TRUST AND THEIR FAMILIES TRUST IN US TO ENSURE THEIR PROGRESS TOWARD A HIGH QUALITY DEGREE. THE THOSE ACCOMPLISHMENTS HAVEN'T HAPPENED JUST BY HAPPENSTANCE THIS ISSUE IS SUCCEEDING BECAUSE OF OUR UNWAVERING COMMITMENT TO GRADUATION INITIATIVE. FOCUSED ON THREE OBJECTIVES IMPROVING GRADUATION RATES FOR ALL STUDENTS ELIMINATING EQUITY GAPS AND MEETING CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE NEEDS. BUT AS MR STORM NOTED OUR WORK IS UNFINISHED IN DOING OUR PART FOR A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL WE MUST ELIMINATE EQUITY GAPS BY RACE BY INCOME. AND BY FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE ATTENDANCE. WITH SOCIAL UNREST AND ECONOMIC UPHEAVAL THAT CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE. THERE'S NEVER BEEN A MORE IMPORTANT AREA OF INVESTMENT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- MISTER STORMED A SECOND CSU'S PRO. YES IT DOES SENATOR- WE WILL INVITE A BY SAID ONCE THAT OFFER COMMENTS- DURING ISSUE NUMBER THREE OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND THEN WILL MOVE TO LISA KING FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING CHEN SENATORS SIX KING FOR ANALYST'S OFFICE DREAM THIS MORNING BY MY COLLEGE CAL. OUR OFFICE OF THE HER AND COMPANIES NAY UNIVERSE BUDGET PROPOSAL. I BELIEVE SENATORS RECEIVE A COPY OTHERS CAN FIND IT ON OUR WEBSITE. YOU'RE FREE TO JUST A FEW OF THE FIGURES I PRISON THIS MORNING. MY COLLEAGUES SUMMARIZE THE FISCAL IMPACT THE PANDA COMING INTO. INCLUDING THE STATE REDUCTION AS WELL AS STRUCK. PRIMARILY IN NON SOFT PRO SUCH AS HOUSING PART. TRODDEN CONTEXT IN SHARED CSU TAKEN IN A BACK AMHERST TO THE FISCAL. SHE SAID ACCESS TO SOME ONE TIME FEDERAL FUNDS. WHICH WE SUMMARIZE IN OUR REPORT ON THREE FIGURE TO. THAT'S FUNDS TOTAL OF ONE POINT FOUR BILL ACROSS TO RUN. IN ADDITION FIFTY HAS TAKEN TAX STRICT CIRCUIT SPENDING IN RESPONSE THE STATE BUT REDUCTION PARTICULAR. FOR EXAMPLE THAT INCLUDE SUSPEND. A LOT OF. DURING THE CURRENT YEAR. THE CAMPUS ARE PLAN TO DROUGHT I RESERVES USER TIME THE. FIFTY SEVEN MILLION FOR CERTAIN COSTS RELATED TO RETIREE HEALTH AND PENSION. AS NOTED IN THE OPENING COMMONSENSE REFLECTS A PARTIAL RESTORATION OF THE CAPTAIN SAYS HE RECEIVED IN THE CURRENT YEAR. THIS AMOUNT WOULD LIKELY LAST HIS HE TO COVER CERTAIN BASIC COST INCREASES INCLUDING BENEFITS FOR EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES. AS WELL AS MEET CERTAIN THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS. BEYOND THAT IT WOULD DELETE IT WOULD LEAVE SOME PORTION OF FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR OTHER COSTS SEVEN SEES HIS CASE THAT COULD MEAN FOR EXAMPLE RESUMING SOME HIRING ON A TARGETED BASIS STOCK FOR OUR COURSES ARE MORE STUDENT SUPPORT UNDER ITS GRADUATION. CHEFS ALL IN ALL WE THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED FUNDING LEVEL IS A REASONABLE STARTING PLAINTIFFS ATTENTIVE BOTH TO UNIVERSITIES COSTS AS WELL AS THE STATE'S. OPERATING DEFICIT. HOWEVER YOU RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REVISIT THE EXACT FUNDING LEVEL NAY ONCE IT HAS AN UPDATE ON STATE REVENUES AND THAT'S A BETTER SENSE OF HOW MUCH OF AN ONGOING AUGMENTATION IT CAN ACCOMMODATE. THE FINANCES NOTED. IT'S THE SUPPORT PROPOSAL DOES COME WITH CERTAIN EXPECTATIONS. RELATING TO EQUITY COUNTY ONLINE EDUCATION DELUDE MISSIONS AMONG OTHER FACTORS. IN GENERAL WE THINK THAT WITH THESE EXPECTATIONS THE GOVERNOR HAS IDENTIFIED AREAS OF COMMON CONCERN WITH THE LEGISLATURE. BUT THERE ARE SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR FIND EACH PROPOSAL. STARTING WITH EQUITY GAP WE THINK THAT THIS IS AN AREAWHERE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC. YOUR RECOMMENDED TALKING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BACK MODIFYING EXISTING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR CSU SO THAT INCLUDES THE EQUITY GAP METRICS THERE WOULD BE IDENTIFIED BY THE SEGMENTS UNDER THIS PROPOSAL. REGARDING ONLINE EDUCATION WE SEE A NUMBER OF POTENTIAL BENEFITS RELATING BOTH TO STUDENT ACCESS TO COURSE WORK AS WELL AS THE SPACE UTILIZATION. HOWEVER A CONCERNED THAT THE 10% THE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE MAYBE AN ARBITRARY GOAL. AND SO WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THAT 10% INSTEAD REQUIRING THE SEGMENTS INCLUDING CSU QUITE CERTAIN BASELINE INFORMATION ON ONLINE EDUCATION. WE THINK THAT INFORMATION ALLOWED THE LEGISLATURE TO FUTURE BUDGET YEAR TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ABOUT HOW BEST TO SUPPORT ONLINE EDUCATION ISN'T BOARD. FINALLY REGARDING DEAL EMISSIONS WE THINK THEIR POTENTIAL BENEFITS OR DRAWBACKS OF THIS PROPOSAL AS IT RELATES TO THE STUDENT TRANSFER EXPERIENCE IT REALLY JUST DEPENDS ON HOW THE DETAILS OF THIS PATHWAY STRUCTURED. RECEIVE SOME OF THOSE DETAILS AND TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE EARLIER THIS WEEK AND ARE IN THE PROCESS OF. GETTING THEM NOW. CONCLUDES OUR COMMENTS IN THIS FIRST AND LARGEST ISSUE YOUR AGENDA THIS MORNING. I'M JENNIFER AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE PRESENTATION AND- LET ME JUST REMIND THOSE THAT ARE WATCHING THAT. THE VERY LAST ITEM ON THE AGENDA IS PUBLIC COMMENT SO WILL NOT BE TAKING PUBLIC COMMENT AS WE GO ALONG TO IT IN THE AGGREGATE AFTER THE DIFFERENT PRESENTATIONS. WELL LET ME LEAD WITH A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND FIRST. UP ON THIS ISSUE WOULD BE DIRECTED TO THE TO THE FIRST QUESTION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THEN I WAS GONNA ASK- WHAT'S YOUR RATIONALE WAS FOR NOT BACK FILLING THE BASE REDUCTION TO THE- CSU SYSTEM. SORRY BRIANNA BRANDS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SO AS INDICATED IN THE AGENDA AT THE CSTO RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT- ONGOING RESOURCES IN THE BUDGET ACT. AS WELL AS ONE TIME FUNDING THROUGH THAT THE VARIOUS FEDERAL OR THESE BILLS ENACTED BOTH IN TWENTY TWENTY. TO TWENTY TWENTY THE MOST RECENT OF WHICH- WAS. ENACTED IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SEEKS TO ADDRESS- A NUMBER IT NEEDS WITHOUT SIGNING THEM OUT OF RESOURCES. THE ADMINISTRATION REMAINS CONCERNED. ABOUT STRUCTURAL DEFICITS IN THE OUT YEARS. BUT IF. YOU'RE NOT RESTORE THE BASE TO WHAT IT IS THAN ANYTHING THAT THE FEDERAL MONEY COMES FOR IS CHALLENGED BY NOT COMING BACK IN THE BASE THE AND THE OTHER ITEMS THAT ARE IN THIS BUDGET ARE CHALLENGED. IN THE BILL TO DELIVER BY NOT COMING BACK TO THE BASE IS THAT SOMETHING AS YOU MOVE TOWARD THE MAY REVISE. WE DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND THE COMMITTEE'S CONCERNS AND WILL DEFINITELY BE TAKING THAT BACK TO OUR LEADERSHIP TEAM. THANK YOU. AND THEN LET ME ASK ONE QUESTION OF CSU- I WAS GONNA ASK IF- YOUR CONTEMPLATING ANY INCREASE IN TUITION IN THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FOR THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. YEAH RAINSTORM AGAIN- SENATOR- WE ANNOUNCED THAT OUR MOST RECENT BOARD OF TRUSTEES MEETING THAT WE'VE ALL. NOT BE INCREASING I TUITION FOR THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE- PRINCIPALLY THAT'S BECAUSE OF A NUMBER OF. IT BITS OF GOOD NEWS OBVIOUSLY THERE IS THAT THE ADDITIONAL INCREASE AT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED THAT'S HELPFUL ALSO THERE IS- THE ADDITIONAL HELP FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON A ONE TIME BASIS SO WE FEEL LIKE IN THE SHORT TERM FOR THE FALL- THAT'S THAT WE CAN TAKE IT OFF THE TABLE IN THE TRANSFER ME TO ANNOUNCEMENTS. OR JANUARY MEETING UP FOR A FALL OF TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE'LL HAVE TO SEE THAT WE MAKE THIS DECISION ON A YEAR BY YEAR BASIS DEPENDING ON. LARGELY WHAT THE ANTICIPATED STATE SUPPORT WILL BE. WE GENERALLY EVERY YEAR SINCE. TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. HAVE THE PROCESS. STEPS PROCESS OUT DELIVERING A TUITION. THE STUDENTS EVERY FALL AND THEN WE FOLLOW THAT. ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAY PROCESS IS OUTLINED IN STATUTE AND THEN AS WE GET TO A CERTAIN COMFORT POINTS WE WILL MAKE THAT DECISION ABOUT WHETHER TO PURSUE TUITION. SAY IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO. BUT WE ONLY RAISE TUITION ONCE IN THE LAST DECADE- AND SO- WE DON'T ANTICIPATE AT THIS POINT- IN TERMS OF OUR TIMELINEOF DOING THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND IT'LL BE A TO BE DETERMINED FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THANK YOU FOR THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION NOW WILL GO TO ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBER SENATOR MEANT. THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY- I HAVE A QUESTION FOR BOTH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN. FOR CSU- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- WHAT WAS YOUR RESEARCH BASIS IN ESTABLISHING A NEW TRANSFER PROCESS- YEAH DID YOU DO ANY STUDY ON THIS WHAT ARE THE PROS AND CONS THAT YOU ON COVERED. AND ONE OF THE PRIORITIES ARE POLICY GOALS YOU'RE YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE WITH THIS. SHARKS THREE FRIENDS AGAIN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO REALLY I WOULD SAY THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AS I MENTIONED BEFORE IS VERY FOCUSED ON ACCESS AND EQUITY AND SO WE SEE THAT ALL EMISSIONS AND- PROPOSAL AS INCREASING ACCESS- AND EASING THE PROCESS. FOR TRANSFERRING FOR STUDENTS. GOING INTO I CSU OR UC- GOT IT ALTHOUGH I A DEAL IT SEEMS LIKE. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD NOT REALLY. TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE TWO YEARS OF ACTUAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE PERFORMANCE THAT WOULD PERSONALLY MATTER BUT LET ME PUT THIS QUESTION TO SEE IF YOU. HAVE YOU STUDY THIS PROPOSAL YET AND WHAT DO YOU SEE. AS YOUR PRELIMINARY- THAT CONCERN OR- YOU KNOW IF IT'S A OF THIS AT ONE OF THE- AND CONS THAT YOU THINK MIGHT ACCOMPANY THIS PROPOSAL. GOOD AFTER GOOD MORNING AGAIN THIS IS NATHAN EVANS FROM CSU- AS MISS KING INDICATED EARLIER THE DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL ARE JUST BEGINNING TO COME FORTH AND SO WE'RE REALLY JUST BEGINNING TO LOOK AT THOSE. I WOULD SAY THAT IT- CONCEPTUALLY BUILDS ON A VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM WHICH IS THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER- WHICH IS HAS JUST CELEBRATED ITS TENTH ANNIVERSARY AND WE NOW SEE THAT- QUICKLY BECOMING. THE PRIMARY MECHANISM BY WHICH STUDENTS TRANSFER FROM CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO THE CSU. I THINK AS WAS NOTED- WE'RE WE'RE JUST REALLY BEGINNING TO LOOK AT WHAT THOSE DETAILS WOULD BE AND AS YOU MENTIONED. IT'S DIFFICULT AT THIS PINT TO FACTOR AND THEIR EXPERIENCES STUDENTS WILL HAVE A COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN THAT PROCESS I THINK CONCEPTUALLY WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO FIND WAYS. SO THAT STUDENTS AND FAMILIES HAVE A CLEAR PATH AS THEY EXIT HIGH SCHOOL VIA A COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND HAVE. A OF MORE- DEFINITIVE PLAN AS THEY ENTER A COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN SETTING INSTEAD OF HAVING TO SEEK THAT OUT. I THINK THERE MAY BE OTHER WAYS THAT THAT COULD BE ACHIEVED USING THE AT T. AS A VEHICLE BUT AGAIN WILL REALLY NEED TO SPEND TIME REALLY LOOKING AT THE ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL. GOT IT- MY SECOND QUESTION IS A ONE THAT FOLLOWS UP ON CHAIRMAN LEONARD'S- LINE FIRST LINE OF QUESTIONING AROUND WHY NOT BACK TO THE KIND I GUESS. MAYBE I WANT TO POSIT IS IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET STRONGLY EMPHASIZES K. THROUGH TWELVE STUDENTS- INCLUDING THE NEED TO REOPEN THE LEARNING LOSS THAT THEY'RE FACING RIGHT NOW FROM DISTANCE LEARNING- I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THIS- WE ALL I THINK. ASSUME TODAY THAT HIGHER ED IS VERY IMPORTANT- THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE TOLD THE CENTRAL YOU NEED A HIGHER DEGREE TO GET A GOOD JOB- ANGEL WHY DO WE NOT HAVE THE SAME EMPHASIS ON HIGHER ED. THAT WE DO FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE- ARE WE JUST BASICALLY ST COLLEGE IS NOT AS IMPORTANT AS AS K. THROUGH TWELVE IT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT SEEMS LIKE FROM. THE THREE PERCENT. OF THE TIME PERCENT BACKFILL- WHERE IS YOU KNOW WE REALLY EMPHASIZE K. THROUGH TWELVE WITH THIS BUDGET AND SO I'D BE INTERESTED IN HEARING THE DEPARTMENT'S FINANCES THOUGHTS ON THIS. YEAH CHRIS FOR YOU SOME OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. CHAU OR K. FOURTEEN BUDGET. WHICH IS BOTH ARE SCHOOL DISTRICTS OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS OUR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. IS GENERALLY FUNDED ACCORDING TO. THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE WITH. A SPECIFIED MINIMUM. EXPENDITURES FOR OUR- FOURTEEN ENTITIES WHEREAS OUR UNIVERSITIES ARE FUNDED THROUGH A NON THE NONPROFIT'S MISSION NINETY EIGHT A GENERAL FUND SIDE OF THE BUDGET- SO CERTAINLY WE ATTEMPT TO BALANCE. THE NEEDS OF THE SYSTEMS AGAINST- THE NEEDS OF ALL PROGRAMS IN THE STATE WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THAT THE CONCERN OF THE COMMITTEE HAS RAISED- AND ARE ACTIVELY YOU KNOW LOOKING INTO THAT PARTICULAR ASPECT- AS WE WORK TOWARDS THE MAIN PROVISION. KEEP FINALLY LAST QUESTION ON MY END- YOU WOULD WITH THE ONE OF THE PROPOSALS ARE WEATHER CONDITIONS FOR THIS 3% BACK FILL IS- I GUESS. INCREASE ONLINE EDUCATION BY 10% COMPARED TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN. HAS ANYONE DONE WHETHER CSU OR THE PARTNER FINANCING DONE- ANY KIND OF STUDY ON THE EFFICACY OF THIS I MEAN I AS A FORMER PROFESSOR WE WERE ALWAYS TAUGHT THE IN PERSON. AND I BELIEVE THE RESURGENT CASES IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN ONLINE LEARNING- HOW DOES THIS FIT IN THIS YEAR'S USE PLANS AND WHAT AGAIN THE PROS AND CONS OF THIS APPROACH. PALACE ARE IN PART IN A FINANCING TO BE INTERESTED TO HEAR FROM THE CSU. CORRECT. RENDON FINANCED- I'M I'M SAYING IT AGAIN GOING BACK TO ACCESS AND EQUITY THE FOCUS HERE- OF THE ONLINE REQUIREMENT IT'S REALLY JUST ENSURING THAT THE CSU IS ABLE TO RETAIN SOME OF THE ONLINE CAPACITY THAT THEY HAD BUILD UP IN RESPONSE TO THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC- MEETING THAT WE WOULD NOTE HERE THAT ONLINE EDUCATION- WELL IT REALLY HELPED EXPAND ACCESS PARTICULARLY FOR STUDENTS- WHO HAVE FAMILY OBLIGATIONS OR WORK OBLIGATIONS AGAIN REALLY TRYING TO FOCUS ON AND. THE ACCESS AND EQUITY PIECE HERE. AND AGAIN THIS IS DAVE EVANS WITH THE C. AS- AND I WOULD AGREE WITH HIS FRIENDS COMMENTS THAT I THINK WELL WE'VE HEARD CHANCELLOR CASTRO CERTAINLY. INDICATE THAT HE BELIEVES THAT THERE IS OPPORTUNITY AS WE EXIT THE PANDEMIC AND LOOK TO THE FUTURE. THAT ONLINE EDUCATION CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE NEW AVENUES OF ACCESS TO A VARIETY OF STUDENT POPULATIONS. OUR ACADEMIC LEADERSHIP ON OUR CAMPUSES ARE CURRENTLY WORKING THROUGH WHAT ARE THE PERHAPS BEST CURRICULAR- HORROR PARADOXICAL SETTINGS FOR ALL FOR THE USE OF ONLINE EDUCATION SO FOR EXAMPLE. FOR EXPONENTIAL LEARNING THAT MIGHT BE LAB BASED OR A FIELD BASED CERTAINLY IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IS A PREFERRED AND THE SOONER THAT WE CAN MOVE BACK TO THAT MODALITY. THE BETTER FOR LEARNING AND FOR THE OUTCOMES OF STUDENTS BUT THERE ARE CERTAINLY FORMATS THAT WE BELIEVE CAN BENEFIT FROM INCREASED ONLINE INSTRUCTION AND SO I THINK- WELL- CENTER MENU MENTIONS SIR THE HISTORIC RESEARCH IN SOME WAYS I THINK THERE'S BEEN A NEW BASELINE SET. AS WE AS NOT JUST THE ISSUE BUT UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE WORKED THROUGH THE PANDEMIC AND DONE A LOT OF LEARNING OURSELVES AS ORGANIZATIONS ABOUT ONLINE INSTRUCTION- AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE WORK AT OUR CAMPUSES ARE UNDERTAKING NOW DETERMINING. WHAT ARE THE BEST CURRICULAR OR PEDAGOGICAL SETTINGS THAT ONLINE CAN BE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL. TO PROVIDE ANOTHER AVENUE OF ACCESS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATORS AND ROADSHOW DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME OKAY THEN WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO ISSUE TO FIVE STUDENT SUPPORTS AND BASIC NEEDS AND IT IS THE SAME THREE PANELISTS AND WE WILL BE DO IT IN THE SAME QUARTER SO WE WILL BEGIN WITH BROWN A BRONZE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE STUDENT SUPPORTS AND BASIC NEEDS. ANDRIANA BENEFIT APARTMENT OF FINANCE AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS A STUDENT FOCUSED BUDGET WITH AN EMPHASIS ON. ACCESS EQUITY AND BUDGETARY RESILIENCY I HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTED IN LIGHT OF THE CO THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC STUDENT SUPPORTS AND BASIC NEEDS ARE CRUCIAL TO ACADEMIC SUCCESS. TO PROVIDE FURTHER SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES FIFTEEN MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND FOR STUDENT BASIC NEEDS INVESTMENTS FOCUSING ON ADDRESSING STUDENT TECHNOLOGY AND MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. FIFTEEN MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND FOR THE BASIC NEEDS COMPONENT OF. THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THIRTY MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR EMERGENCY FINANCIALLY ASSISTANCE AND FINALLY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SINCE THE SUSPENSION DATE FOR SUMMER TERM FINANCIAL AID THERE BY MAINTAINING THE PROGRAM AT SIX MILLION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU WILL HOLD QUESTIONS UNTIL THE END OF WILL GO TO BRAINSTORM NEXT FOR CSU. ACTUALLY I WOULD I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN ECONET AND SCAN- INITIALLY RESPOND ON OUR BEHALF THANK YOU THAT'S GREAT. HELLO THANK YOU MISTER STORM AND CHAIR- AGAIN NATHAN EVANS FROM THE C. ISSUE AS PART OF GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THIS THE ISSUE IS IDENTIFIED SIX OPERATIONAL PRIORITIES TO EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT STDENT SUCCESS AND SUPPORT ACROSS THE C. ISSUES SYSTEM- THESE AREAS WERE IDENTIFIED BOTH THROUGH RESEARCH. AND PRACTICE AS HAVING SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON DEGREE COMPLETION AND STUDENT SUCCESS. THOSE SIX AREAS VERY BRIEFLY OUR ACADEMIC PREPARATION ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT STUDENT WELL BEING AND BASIC NEEDS. FINANCIAL SUPPORT. LEVERAGING DATA TO INFORM DECISIONS AND IDENTIFYING AND REMOVING ADMINISTRATIVE BARRIERS AND THOSE PILLARS HAVE STOOD SINCE THE INITIATIVE LAUNCH. WELL ALL THOSE ARE IMPORTANT THERE'S BEEN A RENEWED FOCUS ON SUPPORTING STUDENTS WELL BEING AND EXPANDING FINANCIAL SUPPORT DURING THE PANDEMIC. CRITICAL TO STUDENT SUCCESS THE BASIC NEEDS INITIATIVE FOR EXAMPLE TAKES A HOLISTIC LOOK AT STUDENTS WELL BEING BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM FROM HOUSING AND FOOD SECURITY TO MENTAL HEALTH AND MOST RECENTLY BRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. WITH THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC AND ASSOCIATED NEGATIVE FINANCIAL IMPACTS OUR CAMPUS IS EXPERIENCED A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR STUDENT BASIC NEEDS SUPPORT WE ARE AGAIN APPRECIABLE OF GOVERNOR OF THE GOVERNOR'S RECOGNITION OF THESE PRIORITIES THAT ARE SHARED BY OUR STUDENTS OUR FACULTY STAFF AND ADMINISTRATION. AND BASED ON EXISTING WORK THIS ISSUE HAS ALREADY ESTABLISHED AN EFFECTVE PROCESS FOR SETTING CLEAR CRITERIA FOR ELIGIBILITY AND THEN SOLICITING AND REVIEWING PROPOSALS. FROM OUR CAMPUSES AND PROVIDING TRACKING AND FISCAL WORDS- TO SUPPORT CAMPUS BASED INITIATIVES AROUND BASIC NEEDS AND MENTAL HEALTH. SO FUNDING WOULD BE USED TO SUPPORT THE FULL RANGE OF THESE INITIATIVES FOOD INSECURITY AND HUNGER HOUSING INSECURITY AND HOMELESSNESS MENTAL HEALTH CRISES EMERGENCY CRISIS FUNDING PERSONAL SAFETY THREATS AND DIGITAL LEARNING NEEDS. WE ALSO SEE THIS IS A CONTEST AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE INCREASE PARTNERSHIP AND COLLABORATION AS A AS OF THE END OF FALL TWENTY ARE FULL TWENTY TWENTY SEMESTER ALL TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES HAVE ESTABLISHED AT LEAST ONE PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS. TO DELIVER DIRECT SUPPORT TO STUDENTS PRIMARILY IN THE AREAS OF FOOD ASSISTANCE TEMPORARY EMERGENCY HOUSING AND MOST RECENTLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND FINALLY REGARDING EMERGENCY STUDENT FINANCIAL AID- LAST SUMMER THIS IS C. ISSUES SUCCESSFULLY DISTRIBUTED TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO MILLION AND DIRECT STUDENT AID AS PART OF THE FEDERAL CARES ACT. WE WOULD ANTICIPATE USING SIMILAR APPROACH THE BENCHMARK STUDENT AGAIN STUDENTS DOCUMENTED FINANCIAL NEED AND AUGMENTED THE FEDERAL DOLLARS WITH PHILANTHROPIC OR OTHER RESOURCES FOR STUDENTS WHO CANNOT QUALIFY FOR FEDERAL STUDENT AID. SO IN SOME WE ARE PORTION OF AGAIN OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S RECOGNITION OF THIS CRITICAL AREA OF NEED. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION AROUND THAT TOPIC. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BUT NOW WILL MOVE TO MEXICAN OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. OKAY OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS SURVEY DATA SUGGESTED THAT AND NOTABLE SHARE OF STUDENTS AT CSU AS WELL AS THE OTHER SEGMENTS FACED CHALLENGES MEETING CERTAIN BASIC NEEDS PARTICULARLY SHOULDN'T HOUSING AND DOESN'T START AT IT THERE ARE SIGNS THESE CHALLENGES HAVE BEEN EXACERBATED SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC. I THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ADDRESSES AN IMPORTANT AND TIMELY PROBLEM. IMMEDIATELY REYES AND OUR REPORT IS THAT IT CONTINUES AS SOME PIECEMEAL APPROACH ADDRESSING BASIC NEEDS THAT THE STATE HAS TAKEN OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. STATION OF THIS APPROACH ON PAGE FIFTEEN OF DALIO'S REPORT IN FIGURE NINE. THIS FIGURE SUMMARIZES THE PROGRAMS LEGISLATURE IS FUNDED RELATING TO BASIC NEEDS SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT I COULD HAVE OVERLAPPING GOALS FOR EXAMPLE SHOULDN'T HOUSING PROGRAM AS WELL AS A RAPID RE HOUSING PROGRAM. MOREOVER YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THERE'S SOME INCONSISTENCIES IN HOW THE STATE IS FUNDED BASIC NEEDS ACROSS THE SEGMENTS COMPARING YOU SEE TO SEE IF YOU FOR EXAMPLE WE FEEL IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THE STATE PROVIDED ONGOING CONSTANCY FOR FOOD HOUSING AND MENTAL HEALTH. ALL PROVIDING ONE TIME FUNDS TO SEE IF YOU FOR THE SAME PURPOSE AS- WITH ALL THE CONTACTS IN MIND WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE ENSURE THAT IF IT IS GOING TO CREATE. TWO NEW ON GOING BASIC NEEDS PROGRAMS AT CSU. THAT THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE CLEARLY DEFINED AND MEASURABLE OBJECTIVES. AND MOREOVER THAT THE PROGRAMS ARE COORDINATED WITH EACH OTHER AS WELL AS THE EXISTING INITIATIVES TO THE STATE HAS IMPLEMENTED TODAY. WHEN THERE'S OPPORTUNITY TO COORDINATE THE ONE TIME FUNDS FROM REGENCY FINANCIALLY IT THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR CSU. SPECIFICALLY IN THIS CASE WE THINK THERE'S OPPORTUNITY TO COORDINATE THEM IN RELATION TO THE FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDS THAT HAVE RECENTLY BECOME AVAILABLE FOR VERY SIMILAR PURPOSE. THAT COULD MEAN TARGETING THE STATE FUNDING TOWARD STUDENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY IT FUNDING. FOR ALL GENTLY EIGHTEEN TIMING THE STATE FUNDS SO THAT THEY ARRIVED AFTER THE FEDERAL FUNDS HAVE DRIED UP. LOOKING LONG TERM IN THE BIGGER PICTURE. LEGISLATURE ALSO CONSIDER TAKING STEPS TOWARD DEVELOPING A MORE HOLISTIC STRATEGY TOWARD MEETING STUDENTS BASIC NEEDS STEPPING AWAY FROM THE MORE PIECEMEAL APPROACH THAT THAT THE STATE HAS TAKEN OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS THIS WOULD OF COURSE INVOLVES A JOINT EFFORT WITH THE SEGMENTS OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AND IT WOULD MEAN ESTABLISHING OVER ARCHING OBJECTIVES FOR THE STATE'S BASIC NEEDS PROGRAMS. DURING THE AMOUNT OF NEED FOR THESE PROGRAMS AND COORDINATING THE PROGRAMS NOT ONLY WITH EACH OTHER AS WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING BUT ALSO WITH TRADITIONAL FINANCIALLY PROGRAMS WHICH ARE ALSO INTENDED TO HELP STUDENTS MAKE THEIR LIVING EXPENSES. AS WELL THE PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS PROGRAMS LIKE CALFRESH THAT ARE INTENDED TO HELP CALIFORNIANS IN GENERAL BUT THIS TAX EXPENSES. THANK YOU THE HOBBIT TAKING QUESTIONS THANK. YOU I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH. I HAVE A FEW- WITH. THE AND THE FIRST ONE IS FOR FINANCE. AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN THE RATIONALE FOR COMBINING MENTAL HEALTH FUNDS WITH TECHNOLOGY FUNDS. YES CERTAINLY SO I THINK IT'S BEEN MADE PRETTY AWARE THAT THE COMING NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS DEFINITELY HIGHLIGHTED SOME ONGOING ISSUES FACING- STUDENTS THAT ARE IN OUR VARIOUS HIGHER EDUCATION- INSTITUTIONS. SO WE SAW A NEED AN INCREASED NEED AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND INTERNET AND TECHNOLOGY ACCESS TO ADDRESS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED A FIFTEEN MILLION I'M ONGOING GENERAL FUND TO THIS YES YOU FOR THESE PURPOSES. WELL THEN JUST FOR THE RECORD MY QUESTION WAS WHY IT COMBINED. BUT NOT THAT WE DON'T QUESTION WE SUPPORT OF THE NEED FOR EACH ONE BUT IT SORT OF MAKES THEM COMPETE AGAINST EACH OTHER RATHER THAN SAYING THIS IS A GOAL WILL SET ASIDE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY TO MEET IT. AND THIS IS A SECOND GOAL AND WILL SET A CERTAIN SET OF. AMOUNT OF MONEY TO MEET IT BECAUSE THERE COULD BE SOME PLACES WHERE. OF THE TECHNOLOGY NEED IS SO HIGH AND APPROPRIATELY SO WITHIN MENTAL HEALTH GET SHORTED BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T VIEW THAT AS A PRIORITY SO I WOULD JUST OFFER THAT AS A CONSIDERATION AS YOU HEAD TOWARD THE MAY REVISE. OF MY OTHER TWO QUESTIONS ARE FOR THE CSU SYSTEM. IN THE FIRST ONE IS THAT- I HAD A COLLEAGUE YESTERDAY ON YOUR BEHALF RATHER VEHEMENTLY TELL ME HOW SUCCESSFUL YOU HAD BEEN. IN RAISING THE PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS THAT GRADUATED IN FOUR OR FOUR YEARS THAT- YOU'D RAISED BY AT LEAST TEN PERCENT. AND THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IS AT THE HEART OF THAT WAS JUST GOING TO ASK YOU. ARE GIVEN THE PROPOSALS IN THE BUDGET WHAT HOW DOES THAT SET AGAINST. YOUR CONTINUING TO MAKE PROGRESS ON THE GRADUATION. INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. WELL I THINK ALSO OFF THE CENTERS RANGE AGAIN FROM ISSUE. I THINK ONE THING IS IN JEOPARDY INSTEAD BEFORE ENABLED HER TO SUSTAIN THAT THAT INCREMENTAL FUNDING THAT WE PUT IN PLACE NOW FOR. FOR A SIX YEAR TIME FRAME SO WHAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED HERE IS WITH THE GRANT INITIATIVE TO BE A SIX YEAR INCREMENTAL INCREASE OF ON GOING FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE INITIATIVE. AND SO FAR THE STATE HAS BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE IN THAT WE'VE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO USE BOTH TUITION REVENUE AS WELL AS A STATE GENERAL FUND SUPPORT. TO REALLY COVER MOST OF THE- REESE. BUT CHALLENGE BEEN IN TWENTY TWO ONE. WITH IT WITH THE BY CUTS THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS- WE ARE. VERY OPTIMISTIC OF COURSE THAT ALL OF WHAT WE GOT IN IN IN TERMS OF ARE EVER GOING FORWARD IN TERMS OF RECRUITING STUDENTS TAKE MORE UNITS. BEING ABLE TO USE A LOT OF THIS BASIC NEEDS. INITIATIVE SORTS OUT OF POCKETS OF FUNDING IS GOING TO PAY DIVIDENDS OVER THE LONG HAUL THE ONE THING THAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IS IF THAT RESTORATION DOES NOT OCCUR- AND IF AGAIN IN IN TWENTY TWO. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IF THERE'S SAY THE LANDING POINT IS ONLY THAT ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN POINT FIVE. WE DO FEEL LIKE THAT SOMETHING THAT IS THAT WE WOULD BE IN JEOPARDY ONE OTHER THING THAT WOULD MAKE WANT TO MENTION AND IT GOES BACK TO ISSUE NUMBER ONE BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT. IS THAT THE FEDERAL FUNDS ARE ONLY AVAILABLE FOR ONE YEAR. BOTH THAT MONEY THAT WAS WAS ADDED BY CURES ACT BACK IN- MARCH APRIL TIME FRAME AS WELL AS THIS NEW TRUNCHEON MONEY. ADDED BY THE CURSOR APPROPRIATION IN DECEMBER SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN. THE GRADUATION IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO MARCH FORWARD WITH EVEN BETTER GRADUATION RATES AND BETTER SUPPORT OF STUDENTS. THAT WE DON'T FALSELY COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT FEDERAL FUNDING WILL SUPPORT THE UNIVERSITY LONGER TERM WHAT REALLY IS NECESSARY YES ONGOING FUNDING THAT CAN. CAN CAN BASICALLY SUPPORT THE FACULTY AND STAFF THAT WILL BE DELIVERING THOSE INSTRUCTIONAL SERVICES AS WELL AS SUPPORT SERVICES TO STUDENTS. AND THEN LET ME COMMENT ON YOUR ANSWER BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE FIRST PART. ON THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE. FOR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THE RELEASE. THE IF YOU DO HAVE. CONSISTENT BASE FUNDING IT TO PASS LEVEL OVER TIME THAT'S GOING TO BE THREATENED AS A GOAL I HEARD THAT CLEARLY EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T SAY IT THAT'S A SINGLE. AND THEN SECONDLY OF SPEAKING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I KNOW HOW YOU GUYS FREQUENTLY THANK IT AND YOU'RE SITTING HERE WORRIED ABOUT OUT HERE DEFICITS AND THAT IF YOU ADD THE BASELINE. BACK IN- YOUR ADDING TO THE OUT YEAR DEFICITS BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO TO THAT BASELINE AT SOME POINT. PREFERABLY THIS YEAR ARE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT CSU CAN MEET THESE NEEDS AND SO I JUST HOPE THAT AS YOU MOVE TOWARD THE MAY REVISE. DO YOU EALLY CONSIDER THAT BECAUSE THAT REALLY ALLOWS ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN BUDGETED FOR TO ACTUALLY BE USED FOR THAT WITH AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS THEM. AND THEN ONE LAST QUESTION FOR CSU. IF THE EMERGENCY FINANCIAL AID FUNDS ARE APPROVED HERE HOW YOU ADMINISTER THEM HOW OR WHAT'S YOUR PROCESS FOR GETTING THEM OUT TO PEOPLE. IT'S AGAIN THIS IS NATHAN EVAN I'M NOT WASN'T SURE IF MY COLLEAGUE RYAN STRONG WAS GOING TO STATUS STEP IN ARE NOT KNOW WE'RE HAVING FUN TECHNOLOGICAL ISSUES WERE PUT TO ONE OF YOU UP ALL THE OTHER ONE TALKS AND- IF YOU EVER WANTED TO PUT WORDS IN RAIMES MOUTH. THIS IS THE TIME. WAY TO DO IT I UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THAT- WELL THANK YOU ITS IT'S- EXCELLENT QUESTION AND I THINK WE- AS I BRIEFLY MENTIONED- IN MY COMMENTS. WE HAD A NAY- WE'VE HAD NOW THE EXPERIENCE LAST SUMMER OF AWARDING OVER TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS DIRECTLY TO STUDENTS IN VERY SHORT ORDER THAT CAME THROUGH THE FEDERAL CARES ACT. AND THE FIRST- HERE OF- DOLLARS THAT WERE APPROVED. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL- WE APPROACH THAT AND AT THE TIME WAS OF THE ESSENCE AS IT IS A CONTINUES TO BE TODAY AND ENSURING THAT STUDENTS AND FAMILIES HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED. TO CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION WE APPROACH THAT IN A THREE PHASE OR THREE TIERED PROCESS WORKING WITH OUR CAMPUSES WHERE- WE LOOKED AT DOCUMENTED NEED TO THAT STUDENTS HAD EVEN PRE PANDEMIC. AND PRIORITIZING THE STUDENTS WITH THE GREATEST NEED FOR EXAMPLE THOSE WITH ZERO ESTIMATED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION TO RECEIVE OF THE LARGER SHARE A SECOND WAVE WAS FOR THOSE STUDENTS AND FAMILIES KIND OF AND THEN IN THE MID TIER WITH SOME NEED. AND THEN THE THIRD WORK WORK FOR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES THAT PERHAPS PRE PANDEMIC HAD NOT BEEN. RECIPIENTS OF FEDERAL OR STATE OR INSTITUTIONAL AID HOWEVER GIVEN THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC HAD HAD SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AND THEIR FANS- FAMILY FINANCIAL SITUATION. SO WITH THAT EXPERIENCE AND LEARNING I THINK WE WOULD TAKE A SIMILAR APPROACH PRIORITIZING THOSE STUDENTS WITH THE GREATEST NEED- AS A MISS KING MENTIONED PART OF IT WILL ALSO BE DEPENDED ON WHAT'S- OR COORDINATED POTENTIALLY WITH. THE FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT ARE COMING FORWARD AND WORK THEY WERE APPROVED IN DECEMBER AS WE SEE ANY SPOT SPECIFIC. LIMITATIONS OR REQUIREMENTS OF THAT FUNDING AND OUR HOPE WOULD BE THAN TO COORDINATED THIS FUNDING THE STATE FUNDING TO EITHER IDENTIFY AND TARGET STUDENTS THAT PERHAPS WERE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR. THAT FIT THOSE FEDERAL DOLLARS OR TO AUGMENT THOSE STUDENTS AND FAMILIES WITH THEIR THE MOST ARE THE GREATEST NEED. THANK YOU WHAT WILL BE INTERESTED TO JUST SEE HOW. THAT UNFOLDS OVER TIME. A NOW QUITE. FOR OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THERE ANY. FROM SENATOR OCHO BOOK ARE NOT ANY QUESTIONS FROM SENATOR MATH I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION- AND JUST PICKING UP ON- WOULD TO USE YOU JUST WAS STATING- WE HAVE A DECEMBER STIMULUS BUT THERE IS ALSO UNDER WAY RIGHT NOW- A NOTHER STIMULUS PACKAGE THAT IS IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S HEADED. TOWARDS PASSAGE- THE AREA AND I GUESS THE QUESTION IS YOU KNOW I FULLY SUPPORT THE PRIORITIES OUTLINED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HERE- YOU KNOW WE WANT TO HELP LOW INCOME STUDENTS WHO WANT TO ADDRESS FOOD INSECURITY HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH- AND TECHNOLOGY GAPS- THESE ARE ALL IMPORTANT PRIORITIES BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION IS. GIVEN THAT WE HAVE ANOTHER TROTTER OF MONEY COMING- AND WE DON'T YET KNOW HOW THAT'S GONNA BE ALLOCATED DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO MAYBE HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY AND DISCRETION GIVEN THE CSU'S AND HOW TO USE THESE FUNDS TO IT TO TRY TO REALLY FILL IN THE GAPS THAT THEY MIGHT SEE. AS OPPOSED TO SEILING. USING INSIDE POCKETS. I AND I GUESS THIS IS A DEPARTMENT FINANCING LA- TELL ADAM YEAH AS YOU'RE AWARE WE WERE DEFINITELY NOT I'M NOT AWARE OF THAT THE MOST RECENT- YOU KNOW CREDIT HOURS RELEASE. FINDING IT WAS PROVIDED IN DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY INTO YOUR POINT IN THE OTHER THERE MAY BE OTHER FINDS COMING- THAT SAID I THINK THE STUDENTS- ARE STILL FACING A GREAT DEAL OF NEED- IN LIGHT OF COME IN THE COMING NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND SO IF WE SEE AN EMERGENCY FINANCIAL. AID AS A WAY TO CONTINUE ACTIVELY PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE CSU- AND OUR OTHER HIGHER. EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. JUST A FOLLOW UP QUESTION THERE A- TOO MANY LIMITS THIS IS FOR THE SAKE ARGUMENT THERE IS A LAW MORE FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. FOR THIS PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF- EMERGENCY SUPPORT FOR FINANCIAL AID FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS. WOULD YOU BE OPEN LATER ON TO REVISED AT CHANGING THIS REQUEST AND PERHAPS- GIVING THE CSU SOME DISCRETION HOW TO USE IT. YEAH CHRIS FERGUSON WITH FINANCE I THINK IT'S A BIT TOO EARLY TO YOU KNOW SPECULATE ON THE DECISIONS THAT WE WOULD MAKE- REGARDING THAT THOSE FUNDS IF AND WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES MAKE THEM AVAILABLE TO THE CSU. SO WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO COMMENT AS TO WHAT WE WOULD PLAN TO DO WITH THE EXISTING RESOURCES HOWEVER. YOU KNOW RIGHT WE DO PUT FOR THOSE RESOURCES FOR OUR STUDENTS AND WHEN YOU PUT THE BOARD IN WHAT WE BELIEVE. TO BE A VERY FLEXIBLE WAY FOR CAMPUSES TO PROVIDE THOSE REACHED. TOWARD THIS IS. A TO SOME OF OUR NEEDIEST STUDENTS IN STATE. SO WE DO PROVIDE A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY TO KEEP ITS IS AND HOW THEY ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM. THANK. THE COMPLETE YOUR QUESTION SENATOR MEANT. GREAT THEN WE WILL MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER THREE WHICH IS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND WE HAVE THE SAME THREE PANELISTS IN THE SAME THREE. SAME PORTER AND SO WE'LL START WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ARAMBULA BRANDS AGAIN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION PLANS FIND GENERAL FUND. SPENDING STRINGY WILL THE CS HERE TO ADDRESS CRITICAL DEFERRED MEGAN'S NEEDS HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY STATED THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS YES YOU ARE SIGNIFICANT AND RESOURCES WILL HELP PROLONG THE LIFESPAN OF THE SYSTEM'S CAMPUSES AND BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER STARK. AND AGAIN SENATOR- I WOULD LIKE TO DO FOR MY TO MY CALL VICE ONE. SHE HAS THE GREAT EXPERTISE ON OUR CAPITAL. PROGRAM THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CARE LAYERED AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AS BRIAN MENTIONED I'M BY SEN ONE ASSISTANT VICE CHANCELLOR FOR CAPITAL PLANNING DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION FOR THE SAME ISSUE. WE APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORT IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN TO EXPAND THE CSU'S ACCORDING TO FINANCE AND FUND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS WITHOUT THE SUPPORT AND SINCE HE WAS HEAVILY RELIANT ON VOTER APPROVED GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS. WHICH HAVE NOT PASSED SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX AND TO A LESSER EXTENT PUBLIC WORKS BOARD BONDS APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE SO THE INCREASED AUTHORITY IN THE RIGHT AT THE STATE REALLY VERY HELPFUL THE IT SEEMS. TO SERVE OUR STUDENTS. WITHIN THIRTY THE CSU IS PRIORITIZE RENEWAL AND IMPROVEMENTS TO CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PARTICULARLY THOSE PROJECTS WHICH WOULD ENSURE THE CAMPUS WOULD NOT BE SHUT DOWN FROM REACH UTILITY POINT OF VIEW OR CRITICAL BUILDINGS. WE DRESS SIZE EXTRACTING ADDRESS START DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG AND WE REALLY HAVE DONE LIMITED NEW FACILITIES TO SERVE ADDITIONAL MEANT. ADAM RELATIVELY NEW CAMPUSES ST CHANNELS IN MONTEREY BAY. THE AUTHORITY HAS ENABLED MORE THAN TWO BILLION TO BE REINVESTED INTO CSU TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES. IN THE MULTI YEAR PLAN THAT WENT BEFORE THE BOARD IN THIS THIS LAST NOVEMBER THE CAMPUSES OF IDENTIFIED NEED OF OVER SIXTEEN MILLION SO TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF NEED AND WE APPRECIATE THE PROPOSED HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. CRISTINA SUIT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PRIORITIES. THE FUNDS WOULD HELP ENSURE THE CSU CAMPUSES CONTINUE TO OPERATE DURING EXPECTED AND UNEXPECTED POWER SHUT DOWNS AND RENEW AGING FACILITIES. MANY OF THE VENTILATION AND LIGHTING REPLACEMENTS. WOULD REDUCE ENERGY CONSUMPTION. FOR THE DEPRIVE ON. BOARD OF TRADE. CARBON REDUCTION GOAL. WE FLEXIBLE IN THE OF THE PHONE TO DRAW DEFERRED. AS WELL AS IMPROVEMENTS AS WAS PROVIDE IN THE CURRENT YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE AS WE ADDRESS CHILD CARE FACILITIES. THE SYSTEM OFFICE HELPS CAMPUSES BY SETTING UP MASTER CONTRACTS AND AGREEMENTS THAT HELP STREAMLINE CAMPUS CONTRACTING IN ORDER TO GET PROJECTS GOING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION WOULD GENERATE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND SIXTY JOBS BOTH INDIRECT AND DIRECT JOBS. THIS IS YOUR REQUESTED ONGOING BASED BUDGET FUNDING FIFTEEN MILLION MESS RAIMES STORM MENTION TO ADDRESS FACILITY RENEWAL. AND THAT WOULD HAVE DRIVEN ABOUT NINE HUNDRED TO NINE HUNDRED FIFTY NINE PROJECTS FUNDING. SO AS IS MENTIONED IT'S. LESS THAN WHAT WE REQUESTED. IT TO DRESS TOTAL NEED VETERANS FIVE AND IN ONE TIME FUNDING. IS MORE THAN THE FIFTEEN. AND IN REQUESTED ON. BASED BUDGET NEEDS SERVICE BRIAN MENTIONED BASE BUDGET FUNDING CERTAINLY GIVES GREATER PLANNING. TO LOOK AT A MULTI YEAR PROGRAM. WE HAVE FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IN PROJECTS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES PREVIOUSLY APPROVED IN HIGHER BUDGET CYCLES THAT SHOULD THE L. WILL FUNDING BE RELEASED EARLIER WE CAN GET GOING ON THOSE PROJECTS. AND APPRECIATE ANY FUNDING BEYOND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO ADDRESS THE SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN THE CITY'S NEEDS ACROSS CSU. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO OF LISA CAME FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. OKAY AS OUR OFFICES SAID IN THE PAST WEEK LEAVE THAT MONEY DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS THAT PRUDENT USE OF ONE TIME FUNDS. IT IS FOR AN EXISTING APPLICATION THAT COULD IMPACT GROW IN THE OUT YEARS IF SHE'S NOT ADDRESS NOW. FOR THAT REASON WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDE AT LEAST A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME THAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES FOR THIS PURPOSE. TO THE EXTENT THAT IT CAN FREE UP ADDITIONAL ONE TIME FUNDS FROM OTHER INITIATIVES THAT COULD EVEN CONSIDER PROVIDING MORE ONE TIME CONSTRICTING MINTS. WE DO A ONE RECOMMENDED MODIFICATION TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. THE CURRENT LANGUAGE REQUIRE THE ADMINISTRATION TO NOTIFY THE LEGISLATURE WHICH PROJECTS ARE BEING SUPPORTED BY THE FUNDS THIRTY DAYS AFTER THE FUNDS ARE RELEASED. WE WOULD RECOMMEND INSTEAD REQUIRING NOTIFICATION THE LEGISLATURE BEFORE THE RELEASE OF THE FUNDS. JUST A LOT MORE MEANINGFUL LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF NOW WILL MOVE TO QUESTIONS AND- I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION MAYBE ALL DIRECTED TO THE CSU REPRESENTATIVE BUT- IT SAYS IN A REPORT TO A NUMBER OF THESE PROJECTS ARE FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY MEASURES IF THIS IS APPROPRIATED IT AND THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECTS ARE IMPLEMENTED WILL THIS MEAN YOUR UTILITY BUDGET WILL GO DOWN IN FUTURE YEARS OF THAT MONEY MIGHT BE AVAILABLE FOR SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IN THIS HERE. YES SENATOR LAYERED IT WOULD ALLOW OUR UTILITY BUDGETS TO BE REDUCED THE OTHER AREA WE'RE TARGETING IS TO BE ABLE TO USE THE DOLLARS AS MATCHING FUNDS TO LEVERAGE SOME UTILITY GRANTS. SO THAT IS ONE OF THE APPROACHES WE'VE TAKEN OVER TIME THE MULTI YEAR. ENERGY EFFICIENCY PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL UTILITIES SO THERE'S TWO FULL BENEFIT TO USING THE FUNDS FOR ENERGY IMPROVEMENTS. I APPRECIATE THAT AND DO YOU IT JUST OCCURS TO ME- BECAUSE A NUMBER OF YOUR- CAMPUSES ARE IN AREAS COVERED BY. COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION CCA'S. DO YOU TO YOUR CAMPUS IS SIGNED UP WITH THAT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THAT'S 325% CHEAPER IN UTILITY COSTS. RIGHT WHAT WE HAVE I'D LIKE TO SAY ELEVEN CAMPUSES ON DIRECT ACCESS BUT YOU YOU MAY KNOW THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO HAVE MORE CAMPUSES ADDED TO DIRECT ACCESS. SO WE ARE LOOKING AT FORMING A COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION COMMITTEE CHOICE ENERGY DONE SOME INITIAL WORK IN HOUSE CONSULTANTS HELPING US ON THAT AND SOMETHING WE HOPE TO PURSUE THIS NEXT YEAR SO IT IS A ACTIVE ACTIVITY WHILE IF YOU- NEED SOME HELP PLEASE. BE TOUCH WITH THE COMMITTEE I KNOW THAT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I WAS IN THE LEGISLATURE BEFORE I DID A BILL. THAT ALLOWED LOCAL ENTITIES TO GENERATE ENERGY AT ONE LOCATION AND MOVE IT THROUGH THE GRID TO POWER THEIR FACILITIES IN ANOTHER LOCATION AND I THINK SOMEBODY DID A BILL AFTER I LEFT TO EXPAND IT TO SEE ISSUES. SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING IN THAT ARENA- THAT YOU NEED ASSISTANCE WITH PLEASE LET US KNOW. THIS IS A TIME FOR OTHER MEMBERS TO ASK QUESTIONS- SENATOR MANY QUESTIONS CENTER OCHO BOTH. OKAY ARE OF NO QUESTION SIR WILL MOVE. TO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR. WHICH IS OUR VARIOUS GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS BUDGET PROPOSALS AND WE HAVE THE SAME PALACE IN THE SAME QUARTER SO IT'S BEGIN WITH FINANCE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR RIANA BRANDS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL IS A HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND. AND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATIONS THIS INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING PROPOSALS. TWO MILLION I'M GOING GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE ADOPTION OF A COMMON INTER SEGMENTAL LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. ONE MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT INCREASED FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS AT THE CSU STANISLAUS STOCKTON CAMPUS. TEN MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE COMPUTING TALENT INITIATIVE ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY MONTEREY BAY. AND FINALLY TEN MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND SUPPORT CULTURALLY COMPETENT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR FACULTY. THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF CSU. ANY COMMENTS ON THIS. YES VERY BRIEF BY ME BRAINSTORM AND THEN I WILL ASK MASON EVANS TO PLEASE CHIME IN ON. US SOME MORE DETAIL BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING I THINK WHAT YOU SEE IN THIS IN THIS. ITEM ISSUE HERE IS A VARIETY OF. OF SPECIFIC VERY SPECIFIC ITEMS TO FOR THE C. ISSUE TO EMPLOY IF THEY WERE APPROVED. I THINK ONE THING GLOBALLY WHAT WE WOULD SUGGEST IS TO PROVIDE US AS MUCH FLEXIBILITY AS POSSIBLE IN ACHIEVING SOME OF THESE GOALS FOR EXAMPLE. ON THE LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT I KNOW. I KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION SO FAR INDICATING THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE AGENDA HAS PROVIDED A GREAT DEAL OF FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY AS UNIVERSITY S. R. TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES HAVE UNIQUE NEEDS. TO ADJUST ACCORDINGLY WE APPRECIATE THE GREAT BUT AS YOU CONTINUE TO CONSIDER THESE AND IF THESE ARE. ALTERNATELY ADOPTED I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO MAINTAIN THOSE THOSE LEVELS OF FLEXIBILITY. THE ONE THING THAT I WILL MENTION ON THE LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM- ONE THING THAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT A NAKED EVENTS WILL ALSO PROBABLY HAVE SOME SOME COMMENTS HERE TO. IS THAT WE DO- WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE BEST APPROACH HERE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A OPEN AND TRANSPARENT- REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR RE REQUEST FOR QUALIFICATIONS SORTS OF MODEL HERE. WHAT THE SEGMENTS CAN COLLECTIVELY GAIN GET THE BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK FOR STUDENTS OR STUDENTS USE AS WELL AS OUT FOR ACADEMIC. PURPOSES SO I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE- THE COMMITTEE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO REALLY JUST PROVIDE THIS ALL THE SEGMENTS BECAUSE THIS PROPOSAL. IS SISTER PLAYED TO ALL BOTH COMMUNITY COLLEGES YOU SEE AS WELL AS US. PROVIDE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO I JUST DO A BONAFIDE OUR OUR P. R. F. Q. PROCESS SO THAT WE CAN GET THE BEST. PRODUCT FOR OUR STUDENTS IN THE LONG TERM. AND. ANYTHING HAPPENS PLEASE. YES I THINK YOU MISTER VERY BRIEFLY- IF ON THE PROGRAMMATIC- A TOP. PERSONAL MANAGE SO. I WOULD- J. THAT FOR NUMBER YEARS SINCE THE ISSUES MAINTAIN. CENTRAL NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS ARE REALLY LEVERAGES SIZE AND SCALE OF THE OUR UNIVERSITY. FOR FAVORABLE PRICING- AND FORTY AS IS NOTED IN THE REPORT FOR TODAY FOURTEEN OF OUR CAMPUSES HAVE GRAVITATED TO ONE SYSTEM WITH THE BALANCE OF OUR CAMPUSES ON OTHER PLATFORMS. AND SEVERAL OF THOSE REMAINING NINE HAVE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN MOVING TO THE MORE UBIQUITOUS PLATFORM- AND THESE RESOURCES CERTAINLY COULD HELP FACILITATE THOSE TRANSITIONS- BUT I WOULD ECHO MISTER STORMS COMMENTS I HAD. A CONCERN WE WOULD EXPRESS IS REGARDING THE INCLUDE THE POTENTIAL INCLUSION OF ANY PROPRIETARY ENERGY AND BUDGET LANGUAGE WE WANT TO BE MINDFUL THAT TECHNOLOGY EVOLVES VERY QUICKLY. AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO CREATE A SITUATION WHERE WE ARE NOT RECOGNIZING THE POTENTIAL FOR- TECHNOLOGY OBSOLESCENCE. IN ANY PRODUCT OR OR SERVICE SO THAT WOULD BE ONE PIECE OF FEEDBACK. REGARDING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR FACULTY- WE'VE SEEN THE PROMOTION OF INCLUSIVE EQUITY MINDED TEACHING AND CURRICULUM. AS A PRIMARY FOCUS OF FACULTY PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE C. ISSUE IN RECENT YEARS. AND THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC IS REALLY AMPLIFIED THE AWARENESS. OF THOSE IN AND OTHER EQUITY ISSUES PARTICULARLY AROUND STUDENTS ACCESS TO DEVICES RELIABLE HIGH SPEED INTERNET. AND THOSE OF ALL LEAD TO A DEEPER CONCERN ABOUT EVERY ASPECT OF INSTRUCTION FROM THEIR- SELECTION OF COURSE CONTENT TO HOW TO BEST APPROACH- AND DESIGN LEARNING ACTIVITIES AND THE CREATION OF COMMUNITY. IN THE DIGITAL SPACE. THESE RESOURCES CERTAINLY WOULD ROVIDE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR FACULTY DEVELOPMENT IN THIS ARENA ALSO HOW HELPING TRANSLATE IT BACK TO GREATER IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. AND I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT HIS SUMMER- PAST SUMMER 60% OF CSU FACULTY ENGAGED AND PROFESSIONAL THE- THAT WAS A OVER HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND HOURS. OF FACTLY DEVELOPMENTS- ENGAGEMENT REALLY JUST TRYING TO ADDRESS- THE MOVED TO VIRTUAL LEARNING- AT WRIT LARGE BUT ALSO DOING SO IN THE MOST EQUITABLE APPROACH POSSIBLE SO THOSE ARE THE TWO ITEMS THAT I JUST WANTED TO BRIEFLY. TOUCH ON THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A NUMBER MOVES THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. OKAY I MEAN REPORT ON THE COMPANY'S MAJOR UNIVERSITY PROPOSALS COVER IS ONE OF THE PROPOSALS INCLUDING THIS ISSUE. THAT FACULTY THRESHOLD AMOUNT AND ONE. IN REGARDING THIS PROPOSAL WE BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS IDENTIFIED AN IMPORTANT AREA OF FOCUS WHEN IT COMES TO EXPANDING ONLINE EDUCATION. BUT THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL COULD BENEFIT FROM PRINTING NEEDS ASSESSMENT FOR EXAMPLE LEGISLATURE ME WHICH NOW HOW MANY FACULTY AT CSU CONTINUE TO NEED SUPPORT WITH ONLINE EDUCATION WHAT TYPES OF SUPPORT THEY NEED. THE COST OF PROVIDING NOT SUPPORTING WHAT EXISTING RESOURCES INCLUDING FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT. NUMBER ONE EARLIER THIS MORNING THE RECOMMENDED THE LEGISLATURE DROPSY SEALING THE OTHER SEGMENTS REPORT CERTAIN BASELINE DATA ON NLINE EDUCATION. WE THINK THAT INCLUDING THAT DATA COULD BE AN ASSESSMENT OF THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FACULTY SUPPORT. WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE WAIT UNTIL IT RECEIVES THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION BEFORE CONSIDERING ANY FUTURE BUDGET WHETHER DEFINING AUTHENTICATION FOR THIS PARTICULAR PURPOSE. SHE DOES ALSO INCLUDE THREE ADDITIONAL PROPOSALS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND SEE IF YOUR MENTIONS PLANNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. IN TOWNSHIP AS WELL AS IMMIGRANTS STOCKTON CAMPUS. WE HAVE AWESOME INITIAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS AND IN THE COMING WEEKS WILL BE FOLLOWING UP THEIR STAFF TO SURELY LEARNED. THAT BEING SAID OF THE SUB COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE ARE ALSO HELPING ANSWER QUESTIONS IN THESE WAS BASED. ON A- THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A NO CLUE. I JUST WANT TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS ON THE COMPUTING TOWN INITIATIVE I THINK THAT'S A GREAT TO. OUR ENTERPRISE BUT NO QUESTIONS FROM SENATOR MAN ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM CENTER GROVE TROUBLE. THERE ARE NONE SO THAT COMPLETES OUR DISCUSSION OF THE FOUR ISSUES BUT NOW WILL MOVE TO THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ANYBODY THAT WANTS TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT REGARDING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL ON SINCE THEY'RE NO SIDES TO KNOW FOLKS.
