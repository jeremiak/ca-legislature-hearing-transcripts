MORE ACCURATE. I WOULD HAVE TO

00:09:55.227 --> 00:09:57.596
I DON'T HAVE THAT EXACT BREAK.

00:09:57.663 --> 00:09:58.998
I WOULD ASSUME IT'S PROBABLY

00:09:59.065 --> 00:10:01.300
HAS TO DO WITH THE STATE ONLY

00:10:01.367 --> 00:10:02.835

REIMBURSEMENTS FROM THE FEDERAL

00:10:07.807 --> 00:10:09.175
GOVERNMENT BUT I WOULD ASSUME

00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:10.509
THE MAJORITY OF THAT'S FALLING

00:10:10.576 --> 00:10:12.478

DOWN TO THREE POINT. NINE

00:10:21.354 --> 00:10:24.924
BILLION- SO IS- THERE'S A

00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:26.826

CATCH TINY ISSUE BUT- WE HAVE

00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:46.505
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT OTHER TYPES

00:11:46.572 --> 00:11:48.074
OF THINGS WE WANT TO FUND AND-

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:49.575
THE L. MEDI CAL SWINGS A

00:11:49.642 --> 00:11:51.310
BILLION HERE AND THERE. SO I

00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:53.112
TRY TO UNDERSTAND AND THEN- ON

00:11:53.179 --> 00:11:55.181
THEM I KNOW THE MEDICO DRUG

00:11:55.247 --> 00:11:59.151
REBATE. FUND IS ALWAYS

00:11:59.218 --> 00:11:59.785
SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW. TURNS

00:11:59.852 --> 00:12:01.720
AROUND AND IT'S TO. UP NO THAT

00:12:01.787 --> 00:12:04.090
CENTER- SO. HOW WE HAVE HERE

00:12:04.156 --> 00:12:06.258
IT'S A SO WE'RE- FOR THIS PAST

00:12:06.325 --> 00:12:07.359
YEARS ABOUT ONE AND A HALF

00:12:07.426 --> 00:12:09.061
BILLION. NEXT YEAR IS ABOUT THE

00:12:09.128 --> 00:12:11.297
SAME BUT- WE I KNOW WE TOOK

00:12:11.363 --> 00:12:12.565
SOME STEPS TO TRY TO MAKE SURE

00:12:12.631 --> 00:12:14.100
WE DON'T HAVE SUCH LARGE SWINGS

00:12:14.166 --> 00:12:15.501
IN THE MEDICAID DRUG REBATE

00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:16.302
FUNDS SO WHAT'S THE LEVEL OF

00:12:16.368 --> 00:12:17.903
CONFIDENCE THAT NEXT YEAR IT

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:19.772
WOULD ACTUALLY. BE AROUND THAT

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:21.807
RANGE VERSUS NOW IT HAS A

00:12:21.874 --> 00:12:23.008
PRICES UNFORTUNATELY USUALLY

00:12:23.075 --> 00:12:24.643
WHEN WE'RE LOOKING BACK. AND

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:28.280
HAVING A HAVING A SIGNIFICANT

00:12:28.347 --> 00:12:29.782
IMPACT ON ON OUR BUDGET. YEAH I

00:12:29.849 --> 00:12:32.218
THINK YOU KNOW- AS HISTORICALLY

00:12:32.284 --> 00:12:34.587
IT IF YOU CAN BE A CHALLENGE TO

00:12:34.653 --> 00:12:36.222
ESTIMATE REBATES BECAUSE- OF

00:12:36.288 --> 00:12:38.224
THE RETROSPECTIVE NATURE. OF

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.960
THEM AND- VARIOUS POLICIES THAT

00:12:41.026 --> 00:12:42.761
DRIVE WHAT WE DO AND DON'T GET

00:12:42.828 --> 00:12:45.564
REBATES ON- SO I SAY WE DO OUR

00:12:45.631 --> 00:12:47.766
BEST TO ESTIMATE THE REBATES-

00:12:47.833 --> 00:12:48.801
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THERE ARE

00:12:48.868 --> 00:12:50.302
DIFFERENT TIMINGS FOR DIFFERENT

00:12:50.369 --> 00:12:51.937
TYPES OF REBATES. ON THAT COME

00:12:52.004 --> 00:12:53.873
IN AND INSTANCE WE ARE ON A

00:12:53.939 --> 00:12:55.641
CASH BASIS. WE DO HAVE TO TREAT

00:12:55.708 --> 00:12:56.942
THOSE UP ONCE WE HAVE A BETTER

00:12:57.009 --> 00:12:59.044
UNDERSTANDING. OF THAT YES IT

00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:00.646
CONTINUES TO BE A CHALLENGE

00:13:00.713 --> 00:13:02.548
FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE BUT AGREE

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:03.849
THERE HAVE BEEN EFFORTS MADE

00:13:03.916 --> 00:13:05.050
WITHIN THE BUDGET TO DO WHAT WE

00:13:05.117 --> 00:13:07.086
CAN TO- TO NOT HAVE THOSE

00:13:07.153 --> 00:13:09.255
SWINGS- ON THE REBATES I. OKAY

00:13:09.321 --> 00:13:10.823
WELL JUST MAKE NOTE THAT YOU

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:13.359
KNOW WE WENT FROM. IN THE PRIOR

00:13:13.425 --> 00:13:15.161

FIVE MILLION TO ONE POINT FOUR

00:13:20.733 --> 00:13:22.034
NINE. ONE TWO ONE FIVE BILLION

00:13:22.101 --> 00:13:23.469
SO YOU CAN SEE YOU KNOW THAT'S-

00:13:23.536 --> 00:13:25.171
AGAIN THAT'S A ONE HALF BILLION

00:13:25.237 --> 00:13:26.805
DOLLAR SWING AND COURSE NEXT

00:13:26.872 --> 00:13:28.474
YEAR WE'RE PROJECTING. ON A

00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:30.643
REVENUE PLUS YOU KNOW- I GUESS

00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:33.245
RESIDENTS PLUS ONE POINT FOUR

00:13:33.312 --> 00:13:33.779
OR ONE POINT FIVE BILLION

00:27:41.393 --> 00:27:43.695
OUT VACCINES FROM MANAGED CARE

00:27:43.762 --> 00:27:44.763
TO P. FOR SERVICE WE PROPOSE

00:27:44.829 --> 00:27:46.865
THAT. I'VE GIVEN THE COSTS

00:27:46.931 --> 00:27:48.299
ASSOCIATED WITH REIMBURSING THE

00:27:48.366 --> 00:27:51.736
ADMIN PORTION OF THE VACCINE-

00:27:51.803 --> 00:27:52.837
WE HAD NOT BUILT INTO THE

00:27:52.904 --> 00:27:54.239
MANAGED CARE PLAN RATES AND SO

00:27:54.305 --> 00:27:56.174
FELT IT WAS APPROPRIATE WE ALSO

00:27:56.241 --> 00:27:57.208
WANTED TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE

00:27:57.275 --> 00:27:59.711
WOULD HAVE- ACCESS REGARDLESS

00:27:59.778 --> 00:28:00.845
OF WHO IS PROVIDING THE VACCINE

00:28:00.912 --> 00:28:02.547
AND SO. AS LONG AS THEY WERE IN

00:28:02.614 --> 00:28:05.550
ROLLED MEDIC CAL PROVIDER- IT

00:28:05.617 --> 00:28:06.918
THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO BILL FEE

00:28:06.985 --> 00:28:08.286
FOR SERVICE AND SO WE FEEL

00:28:08.353 --> 00:28:09.721
PRETTY COMFORTABLE CMS WILL

00:28:09.788 --> 00:28:11.122
IMPROVE THAT. WE HAVE BEEN

00:28:11.189 --> 00:28:12.557
DOING SOME BACK AND FORTH WITH

00:28:12.624 --> 00:28:14.826
CMS IN REGARDS TO- WHETHER OR

00:28:14.893 --> 00:28:16.294
NOT THEY WOULD ALLOW US TO

00:28:16.361 --> 00:28:16.928
COVER THE VACCINE

00:28:16.995 --> 00:28:18.196
ADMINISTRATION FOR THE

00:28:18.263 --> 00:28:20.899
UNINSURED- AND THE RESTRICTED

00:28:20.965 --> 00:28:22.167
SCOPE AND WE CONTINUE TO

00:28:22.233 --> 00:28:24.502
ADVOCATE FOR THAT- WITH THEM

00:28:24.569 --> 00:28:26.137
HOWEVER THEY HAVE. THEY DO HAVE

00:28:26.204 --> 00:28:27.839
SOME OPTIONS FOR REIMBURSEMENT

00:28:27.906 --> 00:28:29.841
ON THAT FRONT OUTSIDE AND SO

00:28:29.908 --> 00:28:31.476
WE'LL CONTINUE TO EXPLORE THAT-

00:28:31.543 --> 00:28:32.944
WITH CMS TO DRAW DOWN THOSE

00:28:33.011 --> 00:28:35.213
FEDERAL FUNDS. ON THE TESTING

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.882
IN SCHOOLS- WE TALKED TO CMS

00:28:37.949 --> 00:28:42.720
VERY REGULARLY. HER GUIDING

00:28:42.787 --> 00:28:43.354
THIS I THINK. THIS WEEKEND LAST

00:28:43.421 --> 00:28:46.091
WEEK WE HAD- COME. AND EMAILS-

00:28:46.157 --> 00:28:48.693
I THINK WE ARE GETTING CLOSE-

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:50.061
IN REGARDS TO THIS ONE I THINK

00:28:50.128 --> 00:28:52.564
THAT THEY ARE- WANTING TO VERY

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:53.798
MUCH PARTNER WITH CALIFORNIA

00:28:53.865 --> 00:28:56.167
REGARDING THIS APPROACH- IN SO

00:28:56.234 --> 00:28:58.336
WE ARE WHO. WE ARE CONTINUE TO

00:28:58.403 --> 00:28:59.370
WORK AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL BE

00:28:59.437 --> 00:29:02.607
ABLE TO- HAVE EIGHT RESULT OR

00:29:02.674 --> 00:29:04.609
APPROVAL OR INFORMATION FROM

00:29:04.676 --> 00:29:06.578
CMS- IN THE COMING WEEKS- IF

00:29:06.644 --> 00:29:08.179
NOT NEXT WEEK HOPEFULLY.

00:29:08.246 --> 00:29:10.281
REGARDING THAT OUTCOME. OKAY NO

00:29:10.348 --> 00:29:11.783
APPRECIATE THAT ALSO FEATURED

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:13.151
ON THE VACCINE COVERAGE WE'RE

00:29:13.218 --> 00:29:14.519
LOOKING TO ESTABLISH MEDICARE

00:29:14.586 --> 00:29:15.854
REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR VACCINE

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.288
MINISTRATION I KNOWTHAN THE

00:29:17.355 --> 00:29:18.823
MEDICAID SIDE HIS PEDIATRICIAN

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:20.859
TAKES CARE OF MEDICAL PATIENTS.

00:29:20.925 --> 00:29:22.627
SOMETIMES THE REIMBURSEMENT FOR

00:29:22.694 --> 00:29:24.062
A DEMONSTRATION STILL BELOW

00:29:24.129 --> 00:29:25.697
COSTS SO THAT'S AND SOMETIMES A

00:29:25.763 --> 00:29:27.899
CHALLENGE FOR SOME. PROVIDERS

00:29:27.966 --> 00:29:29.534
ACTUALLY DELIVER VACCINES SO-

00:29:29.601 --> 00:29:31.436
WILL BE SURE THAT THE DAY

00:29:31.503 --> 00:29:34.939
EXPENSES ARE COVERED- OF- I

00:29:35.006 --> 00:29:36.441
THINK BOTH BECAUSE WILL DIVE

00:29:36.508 --> 00:29:37.642
INTO SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS

00:29:37.709 --> 00:29:38.543
MORE AND MORE DETAILED

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:43.848
SUBSEQUENT. ISSUES SO THANK YOU.

00:29:43.915 --> 00:29:45.316
BOTH OF ALL UP QUESTION TO THAT

00:29:45.383 --> 00:29:47.085
JUST ON ON THE OF. VACCINES IN

00:29:47.152 --> 00:29:50.555
AND- IN SCHOOL. HAVE YOU HAVE

00:29:50.622 --> 00:29:51.856
YOU IS THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST

00:29:51.923 --> 00:29:52.490
THINGS YOU'VE HEARD FROM YOUR

00:29:52.557 --> 00:29:54.859
PROVIDERS IS IT THE LACK OF

00:29:54.926 --> 00:29:55.793
STAFF FOR THE LACK OF TESTING

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.529
IN ORDER OR THE LACK OF STAFF

00:29:57.595 --> 00:29:58.897
I'M SORRY FOR THE LACK OF

00:29:58.963 --> 00:30:00.398
VACCINATIONS IN ORDER TO FULLY

00:30:00.465 --> 00:30:03.334
DISTRIBUTE THE VACCINATIONS- TO

00:30:03.401 --> 00:30:05.870
THE CONSTITUENCIES. I THINK

00:30:05.937 --> 00:30:08.072
THAT- YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN

00:30:08.139 --> 00:30:10.275
WORKING CLOSELY WITH A PUBLIC

00:30:10.341 --> 00:30:11.643
HEALTH AND OTHERS IN REGARDS

00:30:11.709 --> 00:30:15.280
TO- THE VACCINE ADMINISTRATION-

00:30:15.346 --> 00:30:16.848
AND WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH

00:30:16.915 --> 00:30:18.316
OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS FOR

00:30:18.383 --> 00:30:20.451
EXAMPLE- AS INDIVIDUALS ARE

00:30:20.518 --> 00:30:22.187
BEING VACCINATED WE ARE WORKING

00:30:22.253 --> 00:30:23.988
ON DATA FEEDS IMMEDIATELY BACK

00:30:24.055 --> 00:30:24.889
TO OUR MANAGED CARE PLANSSO

00:30:24.956 --> 00:30:26.191
THAT THEY CAN BE PARTNERS IN

00:30:26.257 --> 00:30:28.593
IDENTIFYING INDIVIDUALS WHO-

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:31.329
HAVE NOT HAD. A VACCINE- YET

00:30:31.396 --> 00:30:32.330
AND TO GET THAT INFORMATION OUT

00:30:32.397 --> 00:30:34.199
ONCE IT IS IN THE PHASE IN

00:30:34.265 --> 00:30:36.000
WHICH THAT PERSON WOULD BE-

00:30:36.067 --> 00:30:37.702
AVAILABLE. I THINK THAT THERE

00:30:37.769 --> 00:30:39.270
HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF GREAT

00:30:39.337 --> 00:30:41.773
BUT- YOU KNOW- MOVEMENT TO

00:30:41.839 --> 00:30:43.308
RECENTLY IN REGARDS TO HAVING

00:30:43.374 --> 00:30:44.709
MORE ACCESS TO VACCINE I KNOW

00:30:44.776 --> 00:30:46.010
THAT THERE ARE. A NUMBER OF

00:30:46.077 --> 00:30:47.145
PLANS THAT ARE STILL ROLLING

00:30:47.212 --> 00:30:48.880
OUT IN REGARDS TO IT. I THINK

00:30:48.947 --> 00:30:51.049
YOU KNOW THE MAJORITY HAS TO DO

00:30:51.115 --> 00:30:52.850
PROBABLY WITH THE- THE NUMBER

00:30:52.917 --> 00:30:53.885
OF VACCINES COMING TO THIS TO

00:30:53.952 --> 00:30:55.486
THE STATE. OF AND SO I THINK

00:30:55.553 --> 00:30:56.888
GETTING THOSE TWO INDIVIDUALS

00:30:56.955 --> 00:30:58.890
WHO HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET THE

00:30:58.957 --> 00:31:00.625
VACCINES IN. A WE'VE BEEN

00:31:00.692 --> 00:31:01.960
PARTNERING WITH KEY PARTNERS

00:31:02.026 --> 00:31:03.428
LIKE PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS

00:31:03.494 --> 00:31:05.597
FOR EXAMPLE WHO ARE- HUGE

00:31:05.663 --> 00:31:07.498
PLAYERS IN THE MEDICAID SPACE

00:31:07.565 --> 00:31:09.200
TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE DOING.

00:31:09.267 --> 00:31:10.335
WHAT THEY CAN IN THEIR LOCAL

00:31:10.401 --> 00:31:12.704
ENVIRONMENTS YOU NOT ONLY GET

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:14.005
THE VACCINE OUT TO MEDICAID

00:31:14.072 --> 00:31:15.640
INDIVIDUALS BUT FOCUSING ON IT

00:31:15.707 --> 00:31:17.041
FROM AN EQUITY LENS TO ENSURE

00:31:17.108 --> 00:31:17.942
THAT THEY ARE INVESTING

00:31:18.009 --> 00:31:18.943
THEMSELVES N COMMUNITIES

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:20.812
WHERE. THERE MAY NOT BE AS MUCH

00:31:20.878 --> 00:31:22.013
ACCESS AND SO I THINK THERE

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.382
WILL CONTINUE TO OUR PARTNER

00:31:24.449 --> 00:31:26.584
WITH OUR- R. T. PROVIDERS ON

00:31:26.651 --> 00:31:28.786

VACCINE WORK TO HOPEFULLY GET-

00:31:31.456 --> 00:31:33.725

FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO

00:31:38.997 --> 00:31:41.799
ADD TO CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS-

00:31:41.866 --> 00:31:46.137

JUST TO SAY I THINK THAT'S ONE

00:31:50.275 --> 00:31:53.645
OF THE ISSUES AROUND OF ANXIETY

00:31:53.711 --> 00:31:55.680

FIRST HELLO AT HI. GOOD MORNING

00:36:39.363 --> 00:36:40.798
THIS IS- NETWORKS THE CALL FROM

OFFICE FIRST OFF JUST LET YOU

00:36:44.235 --> 00:36:46.537
KNOW THAT. WE'VE RELEASED OUR

00:36:46.604 --> 00:36:48.472
ANALYSIS OF THE OVERALL MEDICAL

00:36:48.539 --> 00:36:50.274
BUDGET IS THAT THEY'LL GO ON

00:36:50.341 --> 00:36:53.110
OUR WEBSITE. A KEY FOCUS OF THE

00:36:53.177 --> 00:36:55.046
IN HOUSE THIS IS ON IS ON

00:36:55.112 --> 00:36:56.647
CASELOAD WE HAVE WE HAVE A

00:36:56.714 --> 00:36:57.848
SLIGHT DIFFERENCE WITH THE

00:36:57.915 --> 00:36:59.984
ADMINISTRATION OVER- CASELOAD

00:37:00.051 --> 00:37:01.586
GROWTH WHICH IS. IMPORTANT

00:37:01.652 --> 00:37:04.288
BECAUSE IT ACCOUNTS FOR A- VERY

00:37:04.355 --> 00:37:06.190
SIGNIFICANT HE'S OF THE- YEAR

00:37:06.257 --> 00:37:08.392
OVER YEAR FUNDING INCREASE MMHM

00:37:08.459 --> 00:37:10.494
I THINK YOU TAKE AWAY OF OUR

00:37:10.561 --> 00:37:12.730
ANALYSIS IS THAT WE BELIEVE

00:37:12.797 --> 00:37:14.465
THAT CASELOAD GROWTH WILL BE

00:37:14.532 --> 00:37:16.534
LOWER THAN THE ADMINISTRATION

00:37:16.601 --> 00:37:18.202
PROJECTS- AND WE'RE EXPECTING

00:37:18.269 --> 00:37:20.404
AS A RESULT. ABOUT ONE BILLION

00:37:20.471 --> 00:37:22.673
DOLLARS LAST IN CASE OF RELATED

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:25.409
COSTS OVER BOTH MEDIA PER YEAR

00:37:25.476 --> 00:37:27.345
AND THE BUDGET YEAR. HAVING

00:37:27.411 --> 00:37:28.412
SAID THAT WE ARE NOT

00:37:28.479 --> 00:37:30.481
RECOMMENDING ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO

00:37:30.548 --> 00:37:33.017
THE BUDGET RIGHT NOW. VK SO%

00:37:33.084 --> 00:37:35.720
PROJECTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO

00:37:35.786 --> 00:37:38.422
SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY EVEN.

00:37:38.489 --> 00:37:39.757
MORE MORE SUBTLY AND NOT AT

00:37:39.824 --> 00:37:41.025
THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF THE

00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:46.497
UNPRECEDENTED. A PANDEMIC. AND

00:37:46.564 --> 00:37:47.965
SO WE FEEL WOULD BE APPROPRIATE

00:37:48.032 --> 00:37:50.735
TO WE UNTIL MAY WHEN WE HAVE-

00:37:50.801 --> 00:37:52.236
DATA ON- CASES INCREASES OVER

00:37:52.303 --> 00:37:54.205
THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC TO

00:37:54.271 --> 00:37:56.307
WORK OFF OF- BUT JUST BRIEFLY

00:37:56.374 --> 00:37:59.076
GO OVER. SOME OF THE SOURCES OF

00:37:59.143 --> 00:38:03.180
OUR OUR DIFFERENCES- SO IF YOU

00:38:03.247 --> 00:38:05.616
LOOK AT HISTORIC GROWTH OVER

00:38:05.683 --> 00:38:07.451
THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC

00:38:07.518 --> 00:38:10.421
THAT'S FAR FROM. MARCH TWENTY

00:38:10.488 --> 00:38:12.223
TWENTY UP UNTIL DECEMBER TWENTY

00:38:12.289 --> 00:38:13.424
TWENTY WHICH IS THAT WHEN THE

00:38:13.491 --> 00:38:15.393
MOST RECENT- DATA ON KESSLER

00:38:15.459 --> 00:38:17.261
WAS AVAILABLE- WHEN WE WERE

00:38:17.328 --> 00:38:19.263
CONDUCTING OUR ANALYSIS- OVER

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:22.633
OVER THAT. THE AVERAGE MONTHLY

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.201
MEDICAL CASE OF GROWTH WAS A

00:38:24.268 --> 00:38:27.405
LITTLE BIT LESS THAN A HUNDRED

00:38:27.471 --> 00:38:30.708
FORTY THOUSAND NEW ENROLLEES- I

00:38:30.775 --> 00:38:32.209
NOW ORDER TO REACH THE AT

00:38:32.276 --> 00:38:33.344
NUMBER IS THAT THE

00:38:33.411 --> 00:38:35.146
ADMINISTRATION IS PROJECTING.

00:38:35.212 --> 00:38:36.947
THAT WOULD NEED TO INCREASE IN

00:38:37.014 --> 00:38:39.116
CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:38:39.183 --> 00:38:41.419
BY NEARLY 50% FROM FROM LESS

00:38:41.485 --> 00:38:42.953
THAN A HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:44.455
NEW ENROLLEES- MONTHS YOU.

00:38:44.522 --> 00:38:47.091
NEARLY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND-

00:38:47.158 --> 00:38:49.527
ENROLLEES PER MONTH. NOW THAT

00:38:49.593 --> 00:38:50.494
THAT IS WITHIN THE REALM OF

00:38:50.561 --> 00:38:52.763
POSSIBILITY BUT WE THINK IT

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:54.498
REPRESENTS A- WORST CASE

00:38:54.565 --> 00:38:56.100
SCENARIO RATHER THAN WHAT WE

00:38:56.167 --> 00:38:58.035
WOULD CONSIDER TO BE THE- THE

00:38:58.102 --> 00:39:00.604
LIKELY SCENARIO. THE OTHER

00:39:00.671 --> 00:39:02.506
IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW IS THAT.

00:39:02.573 --> 00:39:04.809
WE THINK THAT OF THE NEW

00:39:04.875 --> 00:39:05.943
ENROLLEES SET THAT WILL BE

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:07.645
ADDED OVER THE COURSE OF A

00:39:07.712 --> 00:39:10.448
CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY

00:39:10.514 --> 00:39:12.249
ONE. WE EXPECT A RELATIVELY FEW

00:39:12.316 --> 00:39:14.251
WORST IN YEARS AND PEOPLE WITH

00:39:14.318 --> 00:39:15.553
DISABILITIES AND THAT

00:39:15.619 --> 00:39:17.488
POPULATION AND ILLUSTRATION IS

00:39:17.555 --> 00:39:20.224
PREDICTING AND- MORE FAMILIES

00:39:20.291 --> 00:39:22.426
AND CHILDLESS ADULTS WHO ARE

00:39:22.493 --> 00:39:24.595
RELATIVELY SPEAKING TEND TO BE.

00:39:24.662 --> 00:39:26.697
LESS COSTLY TO PROVIDE COVERAGE

00:39:26.764 --> 00:39:30.501
TO- SO THAT'S WHERE WE GET THE-

00:39:30.568 --> 00:39:32.369
PROJECTED A ONE BILLION DOLLARS

00:39:32.436 --> 00:39:34.705
LOWER THAN THE- ADMINISTRATION

00:39:34.772 --> 00:39:37.675
IS PROJECTING. BUT BUT AGAIN I

00:39:37.742 --> 00:39:39.877
JUST- JUST TO REITERATE- THIS

00:39:39.944 --> 00:39:41.946
IS ALL SUBJECT TO- SIGNIFICANT

00:39:42.012 --> 00:39:43.714
UNCERTAINTY AND SO AS A RESULT

00:39:43.781 --> 00:39:45.549
WE ARE NOT RECOMMENDING ANY

00:39:45.616 --> 00:39:47.017
ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BUDGET

00:39:47.084 --> 00:39:49.653
BEFORE NAY- HAPPY TO TAKE ANY

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.489
QUESTIONS ARE YOU- ARE YOU IN

00:39:51.555 --> 00:39:53.290
ARE YOU PROJECTING. FEWER

00:39:53.357 --> 00:39:56.727
SENIORS JUST BECAUSE YOU THINK

00:39:56.794 --> 00:39:57.962
THEY'RE ALREADY ALL IN THE POOL.

00:39:58.028 --> 00:40:00.131
ALL RIGHT YEAH WELL BEYOND A

00:40:00.197 --> 00:40:01.932
LOT OF THE- WHAT'S DRIVING

00:40:01.999 --> 00:40:05.136
CASELOAD IS- GOING TO BE-

00:40:05.202 --> 00:40:08.272
EMPLOYMENT LOSSES. AND SO WE

00:40:08.339 --> 00:40:10.241
THINK THAT AS A RESULT. IN MANY

00:40:10.307 --> 00:40:11.742
OF THE GAMES ARE GOING TO BE

00:40:11.809 --> 00:40:12.343
FROM THE WORKING AGE

00:40:12.409 --> 00:40:15.780
POPULATION. THANK YOU .COM YEAH

00:40:15.846 --> 00:40:16.947
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND-

00:40:17.014 --> 00:40:18.516
VITIATE COMING FROM BOTH THE

00:40:18.582 --> 00:40:20.751
ADMINISTRATION AND A LOW- ON

00:40:20.818 --> 00:40:22.920
THIS SO IN THIS PROJECTION-

00:40:22.987 --> 00:40:23.587
WE'RE ASSUMING THE PUBLIC

00:40:23.654 --> 00:40:26.690
HEALTH EMERGENCY WILL GO UNTIL.

00:40:28.459 --> 00:40:29.593
TWENTY ONE I UNDERSTAND THAT-

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:32.496
AS PART OF THE- THAT WE BOTH

00:40:32.563 --> 00:40:34.165
GET INCREASE F. MAP BUT ALSO

00:40:34.231 --> 00:40:36.600
WE'RE WE- ALSO HAVE TO COMMIT

00:40:36.667 --> 00:40:38.202
TO PROVIDING. CONTINUED

00:40:38.269 --> 00:40:40.337
COVERAGE AND THAT SEEMS AT

00:40:40.404 --> 00:40:41.806
LEAST FROM THE EXPLANATION IS

00:40:41.872 --> 00:40:43.073
PART OF ONE OF THE STRONGEST

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:44.408
WRITING SOME OF THE

00:40:44.475 --> 00:40:44.942
ADMINISTRATION'S INCREASED

00:41:22.913 --> 00:41:23.848
PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES

00:41:23.914 --> 00:41:25.916
OVERLY SPACE AND THAT

00:41:25.983 --> 00:41:27.685
REQUIREMENT NO LONGER APPLIES

00:41:27.751 --> 00:41:29.854
AS WELL AS THE YOU KNOW LOSS OF

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.455
THESE ENHANCE F. MAP SO IN

00:41:31.522 --> 00:41:32.623
TERMS OF CASELOAD WHAT WHAT

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:34.058
HAPPENS AFTER. DECEMBER THIRTY

00:41:34.124 --> 00:41:36.927
FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE WAS

00:41:36.994 --> 00:41:37.528
ADMINISTRATION PROJECTING FOR

00:41:37.595 --> 00:41:41.532
THIS BUDGET. OR SO- WE DO- WE

00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:42.900
HAVE LOOKED AT THE GUIDANCE

00:41:42.967 --> 00:41:45.135
THAT CMS'S PROVIDED IN REGARDS

00:41:45.202 --> 00:41:45.903
TO THE STEPS THAT STATES WILL

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:47.404
HAVE TO TAKE TO. LOOK AT

00:41:47.471 --> 00:41:49.073
REDETERMINATION AT THE END OF

00:41:49.139 --> 00:41:51.075
THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY-

00:41:51.141 --> 00:41:51.876
YOUR MASTER'S CURRENT

00:41:51.942 --> 00:41:53.410
RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THAT

00:41:53.477 --> 00:41:54.778
TAKE PLACE WITHIN SIX MONTHS

00:41:54.845 --> 00:41:57.248
HOWEVER. GIVEN THE LARGE- SIZE

00:41:57.314 --> 00:41:59.116
AND SCOPE OF THE MEDIC HOW-

00:41:59.183 --> 00:42:01.518
PROGRAMMING CALIFORNIA- WE ARE

00:42:01.585 --> 00:42:02.820
CURRENTLY ESTIMATED IN THE

00:42:02.887 --> 00:42:03.587
BUDGET THAT IT WOULD TAKE A

00:42:03.654 --> 00:42:06.023
FULL TWELVE MONTHS TO. EVALUATE

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:07.791
I'M INTO THE RE DETERMINATIONS

00:42:07.858 --> 00:42:09.860
FOR THAT TIME PERIOD- IN WHICH

00:42:09.927 --> 00:42:11.462
CASE WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE-

00:42:11.528 --> 00:42:12.796
THERE ARE SOME OPTIONS IN

00:42:12.863 --> 00:42:13.564
REGARDS TO THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

00:42:13.631 --> 00:42:15.766
THAT WOULD STAY ON. A MEDIC CAL

00:42:15.833 --> 00:42:17.601
BASED ON THAT REDETERMINATION

00:42:17.668 --> 00:42:19.970
OF AND OPPOSE- THAT WOULD AND-

00:42:20.037 --> 00:42:21.538
NO LONGER BE ELIGIBLE OF

00:42:21.605 --> 00:42:22.873
SUPPORT FOR THE PROGRAM OR

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:24.208
COULD HAVE A CHANGE ENSURE

00:42:24.275 --> 00:42:25.876
COSTS FOR EXAMPLE ALL OF THOSE

00:42:25.943 --> 00:42:27.578
SCENARIOS ARE. ARE POSSIBLE-

00:42:27.645 --> 00:42:29.046
AFTER THAT TIME PERIOD AND SO

00:42:29.113 --> 00:42:30.180
THAT IS WHAT THE BUDGET IS

00:42:30.247 --> 00:42:31.615
CURRENTLY ASSUMING OKAY SO

00:42:31.682 --> 00:42:33.550
THEREFORE YOU WOULD EXPECT-

00:42:33.617 --> 00:42:35.386
THAT NOBODY WOULD BE THIS

00:42:35.452 --> 00:42:36.553
DROPPED WHAT HAPPENED OVER A

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:37.655
PERIOD OF A YEAR IN TERMS OF

00:42:37.721 --> 00:42:40.858
RETURNING ELIGIBILITY. AND AND

00:42:40.925 --> 00:42:43.260
IF THE CMS GUIDANCE IS SIX

00:42:43.327 --> 00:42:46.931
MONTHS IS THAT. DOES THAT PUT

00:42:46.997 --> 00:42:48.666
THE STATE AT RISK. FOR

00:42:48.732 --> 00:42:49.833
BASICALLY COURSE THE FEDERAL

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:51.468
BATCHES THEY THEY MAY COME BACK

00:42:51.535 --> 00:42:52.903
AND SAY WELL GEE WHAT YOU KNOW

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:54.772
WE WANT YOU TO DO THIS IN SIX

00:42:54.838 --> 00:42:56.206
MONTHS AND- WHY SHOULD WE BE

00:42:56.273 --> 00:42:57.174
PAYING A MATCH FOR SOMETHING

00:42:57.241 --> 00:42:59.009
OVER YEARS AND ISSUES THAT.

00:42:59.076 --> 00:43:01.011
YOU'D EXPECT MIGHT COME UP- IN

00:43:01.078 --> 00:43:03.047
TERMS OF. AGAIN I'M SOMEONE WHO

00:43:03.113 --> 00:43:04.114
ACTUALLY DOESN'T WANT TO TRY TO

00:43:04.181 --> 00:43:05.516
TELL PEOPLE OFF THAT BUT I JUST

00:43:05.582 --> 00:43:07.051
WANT TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THIS

00:43:07.117 --> 00:43:08.819
BEING A FEDERAL STATE PROGRAM.

00:43:08.886 --> 00:43:11.121
AND CMS GIVES GUIDELINES- IF WE

00:43:11.188 --> 00:43:12.623
DON'T FOLLOW THEIR GUIDELINES

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:14.224
STATE SOMETIMES SAY OKAY WE

00:43:14.291 --> 00:43:15.626
WANT TO CLAW BACK OUR SHARE THE

00:43:15.693 --> 00:43:17.094
MONEY AND YOU CAN PAY FOR IT.

00:43:17.161 --> 00:43:20.264
SO DO WE- CAN DO WHAT CAN YOU

00:43:20.331 --> 00:43:21.298
JUST CLARIFY THAT'S AN ISSUE.

00:43:21.365 --> 00:43:23.233
SO ARE WE ARE CURRENTLY

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:26.103
ADVOCATING WITH CMS. TO ALLOW

00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:26.637
FOR THE TWELVE MONTH TIME

00:43:26.704 --> 00:43:29.506
PERIOD- AND ARTICULATING TO

00:43:29.573 --> 00:43:30.908
THEM WHY THAT'S GOING TO BE SO

00:43:30.975 --> 00:43:32.676
IMPORTANT I THINK- WHEN THEY

00:43:32.743 --> 00:43:33.944
ORIGINALLY. ISSUED THAT

00:43:34.011 --> 00:43:35.112
GUIDANCE I DON'T THINK MANY

00:43:35.179 --> 00:43:36.981
ANTICIPATED THAT THE PUBLIC

00:43:37.047 --> 00:43:38.382
HEALTH EMERGENCY WOULD BE. I'M

00:43:38.449 --> 00:43:39.550
STILL IN PLACE ALL THE WAY

00:43:39.616 --> 00:43:41.185
THROUGH DECEMBER OF TWENTY

00:43:41.251 --> 00:43:41.785
TWENTY ONE THAT GUIDANCE WAS

00:43:41.852 --> 00:43:43.721
RELEASED. I'M QUITE SOME TIME

00:43:43.787 --> 00:43:46.323
AGO I DURING. THAT TWENTY

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:47.658
TWENTY AND SO- WITH THE NEW

00:43:47.725 --> 00:43:49.293
ADMINISTRATION COMING IN- WE

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:51.028
HAVE FULL INTENTIONS OF. I'M

00:43:51.095 --> 00:43:52.863
CONTINUING TO EDUCATE OUR CMS

00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:54.298
COLLEAGUES IN REGARDS TO THE

00:43:54.365 --> 00:43:56.033
HEAVY LIFT THAT THIS WILL TAKE

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:56.834
ESPECIALLY IN STATES AS LARGE

00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:58.836
AS CALIFORNIA. WITH THE NUMBER

00:43:58.902 --> 00:43:59.903
OF LIVES THAT WE WILL HAVE TO

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:01.939
RE DETERMINE- IN OF COURSE THE

00:44:02.006 --> 00:44:03.374
CMS STILL OPINES WE DO HAVE

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.142
ESTIMATES ARE THAT ALLOW FOR US

00:44:05.209 --> 00:44:06.343
TO MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS TO

00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:08.412
COMPLY WITH FEDERAL LAW- AND WE

00:44:08.479 --> 00:44:10.147
WOULD. BE LOOKING TO WORK WITH

00:44:10.214 --> 00:44:11.181
OUR COUNTY PARTNERS ON WHAT

00:44:11.248 --> 00:44:12.716
THAT WOULD TAKE THEM. IN ORDER

00:44:12.783 --> 00:44:13.817
TO MEET WITHIN SIX MONTHS

00:44:13.884 --> 00:44:15.052
VERSUS TWELVE MONTHS SO WE DO

00:44:15.119 --> 00:44:17.087
HAVE- ANALYTICS ON BOTH SIDES

00:44:17.154 --> 00:44:18.789
BUT ARE CURRENTLY STILL I'M

00:44:18.856 --> 00:44:21.058
ADVOCATING TO CMS THAT. WE NEED

00:44:21.125 --> 00:44:23.360
TO BE REASONABLE- WITHIN THIS-

00:44:23.427 --> 00:44:24.928
EXTENSION ESPECIALLY SINCE THE

00:44:24.995 --> 00:44:26.130
PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AT THIS

00:44:26.196 --> 00:44:27.398
POINT HAS GONE AS LONG AS IT

00:44:27.464 --> 00:44:29.366
HAS. OKAY THANK YOU AN ALLEY-

00:44:29.433 --> 00:44:30.634
ARE USING THE SAME ASSUMPTIONS

00:44:30.701 --> 00:44:32.836
AND YOUR DETERMINATION IF-

00:44:32.903 --> 00:44:35.472
CASELOAD FOR. NEXT YEAR

00:44:35.539 --> 00:44:36.373
RECOGNIZING THAT AFTER

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:38.042
DECEMBER. AND USING THE SAME

00:44:38.108 --> 00:44:39.610
ASSUMPTION THAT AFTER DECEMBER

00:44:39.676 --> 00:44:40.811
THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY

00:44:40.878 --> 00:44:49.086
ONE- AT LEAST- THAT- COMMITTEE

00:44:49.153 --> 00:44:49.920
SOME CHANGES BECAUSE AT THE END.

00:44:49.987 --> 00:44:50.521
WELL THE END OF THE PROJECTED

00:44:50.587 --> 00:44:51.155
AND OF THE PUBLIC EMERGENCY WE

00:44:51.221 --> 00:44:52.022
DON'T KNOW WHAT REALLY. BUT

00:44:52.089 --> 00:44:53.023
BECAUSE- SINCE WE'RE GUESSING

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:56.727
INTO THE FUTURE. YES SENATOR-

00:44:56.794 --> 00:44:58.695
WE- WE THINK THE

00:44:58.762 --> 00:45:00.664
ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATE OF

00:45:00.731 --> 00:45:01.298
WHEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH

00:45:01.365 --> 00:45:03.267
EMERGENCY IS LIKELY TO AND- IS

00:45:03.333 --> 00:45:05.836
REASONABLE- WE HAVE THE RE

00:45:05.903 --> 00:45:08.372
DETERMINATIONS. AT THE-

00:45:08.439 --> 00:45:10.407
BEGINNING OF THE- RESUMPTION OF

00:45:10.474 --> 00:45:12.209
REDETERMINATION IS STARTING OUT

00:45:12.276 --> 00:45:13.844
A LITTLE BIT LATER THAN THE

00:45:13.911 --> 00:45:15.679
ADMINISTRATION JUST BECAUSE WE-

00:45:15.746 --> 00:45:17.614
WE THINK IT WILL. TAKE A LITTLE

00:45:17.681 --> 00:45:19.450
BIT MORE TIME FOR US TO SEE THE

00:45:19.516 --> 00:45:21.251
EFFECT OF THAT. IN THE CASE OF

00:45:21.318 --> 00:45:23.654
NUMBERS. AND I BELIEVE THERE'S

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:26.957
A SMALL DIFFERENCE ALSO IN THE

00:45:27.024 --> 00:45:28.725
RATE AT WHICH WE THINK THE

00:45:28.792 --> 00:45:29.893
REDETERMINATION WILL AFFECT

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.862
CASELOAD OVER THE- COMING YEAR

00:45:31.929 --> 00:45:35.165
BUT- OVERALL EIGHT EIGHT. IT'S

00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:37.401
FAIR TO SAY THAT- THE

00:45:37.468 --> 00:45:39.303
ADMINISTRATION AND L. A. O. R.

00:45:39.369 --> 00:45:42.573
R. FAIRLY ALIGNMENT ON ON THE

00:45:42.639 --> 00:45:44.374
A. SIX OPTIONS OKAY SO SOUNDS

00:45:44.441 --> 00:45:44.908
LIKE THE MAIN DIFFERENCE

00:45:44.975 --> 00:45:47.311
BETWEEN YOUR- YOUR ASSUMPTIONS

00:45:47.377 --> 00:45:49.746
AND- AND MINISTRATION HAS TO DO

00:45:49.813 --> 00:45:50.848
MORE WITH THE ENROLLMENT RATE

00:45:50.914 --> 00:45:52.216
TODAY AND THE PEOPLE BEING

00:45:52.282 --> 00:45:56.053
DISTANT ROLL LATER. SO OKAY. I

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:56.920
THANK YOU I THINK THIS GROUP

00:45:56.987 --> 00:45:58.255
DEPARTMENT FINANCING THEN THAT

00:45:58.322 --> 00:46:01.758
CENTER MELINDA'S. MORNING AND

00:46:01.825 --> 00:46:03.227
NIGHT BECAUSE THE WITH THE

00:46:03.293 --> 00:46:04.561
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- JUST

00:46:04.628 --> 00:46:06.630
WANT TO CIRCLE BACK ON A FEW

00:46:06.697 --> 00:46:08.332
ISSUES THAT. LA- REYES IN

00:46:08.398 --> 00:46:11.034
REGARDS TO CASE LOAD SO- ONE IN

00:46:11.101 --> 00:46:12.569
TERMS OF THE ENROLLMENT RATE-

00:46:12.636 --> 00:46:14.404
OUR ESTIMATE DOES PROJECT THAT

00:46:14.471 --> 00:46:16.006
THE ENROLLMENT RATE IN TWENTY

00:46:16.073 --> 00:46:17.808
TWENTY ONE. WILL BE HIGHER THAN

00:46:17.875 --> 00:46:20.210
THE ACTUAL THAT WE'VE SEEN IN

00:46:20.277 --> 00:46:20.777
TWENTY TWENTY AND WE BELIEVE

00:46:20.844 --> 00:46:22.112
THAT TO BE RECENT ONE THAT'S-

00:46:22.179 --> 00:46:24.047
PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FACT THAT-

00:46:24.114 --> 00:46:25.949
ACTUALS IN TWENTY TWENTY YOU

00:46:26.016 --> 00:46:27.084
DON'T REALLY REVEAL ANY ON

00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:29.086
LABOR MARKET UPTAKE AS WE HAD

00:46:29.153 --> 00:46:30.921
EXPECTED AT THE BUDGET ACT. BUT

00:46:30.988 --> 00:46:32.756
IN CONSULTING RESEARCHERS WE DO

00:46:32.823 --> 00:46:34.191
BELIEVE THAT THE LABOR MARKET

00:46:34.258 --> 00:46:35.859
IMPACTS AND ECONOMIC I'LL

00:46:35.926 --> 00:46:37.294
FOLLOW OF THE RECESSION WILL

00:46:37.361 --> 00:46:39.496
RESULT IN SOME OF THAT TAKE IN

00:46:39.563 --> 00:46:41.265
TWENTY TWENTY ONE- AND SO AGAIN

00:46:41.331 --> 00:46:42.766
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE KIND OF. A

00:46:42.833 --> 00:46:47.371
HIGHER RATE OF ENROLLMENT IN

00:46:47.437 --> 00:46:47.938
TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY

00:46:48.005 --> 00:46:48.805
TWENTY AND THEN IN REGARDS TO

00:46:48.872 --> 00:46:50.574
THE SECOND ISSUE THE CASELOAD

00:46:50.641 --> 00:46:53.110
MIX OR THE DISTRIBUTION- THE

00:46:53.177 --> 00:46:55.179
PERCENT OF SENIORS AND PERSONS

00:46:55.245 --> 00:46:57.181
WITH DISABILITIES THAT WE HAVE

00:46:57.247 --> 00:46:58.916
IN OUR FISCAL IS REALLY BEING

00:46:58.982 --> 00:47:00.817
DRIVEN BY THE AXLES THAT WE'VE

00:47:00.884 --> 00:47:01.785
SEEN WITH THE CONTINUOUS

00:47:01.852 --> 00:47:03.820
COVERAGE. POPULATION TO DATE SO

00:47:03.887 --> 00:47:05.589
WILL BE CIRCLING BACK WITH-

00:47:05.656 --> 00:47:07.357
BELIAU AFTER THIS TO SEE WHAT

00:47:07.424 --> 00:47:08.559
MIGHT BE THE DISCREPANCY IN

00:47:08.625 --> 00:47:09.927
TERMS OF THE ACTUAL AS WE'RE

00:47:09.993 --> 00:47:11.428
LOOKING AT BUT AGAIN WE BELIEVE

00:47:11.495 --> 00:47:13.597
OUR CASELOAD MIX. IS REASONABLE

00:47:13.664 --> 00:47:18.502
GIVEN THE ACTUAL. CELL WE'RE

00:47:18.569 --> 00:47:19.136
LOOKING AT. THANK YOU. WHEN YOU

00:47:19.203 --> 00:47:20.103
LOOK AT PEOPLE STAYING ON

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:20.737
BECAUSE THEY WON'T BE DISCHARGE

00:47:20.804 --> 00:47:23.140
IN THE NEXT YEAR. EXACTLY THANK

00:47:23.207 --> 00:47:28.145
U. S. CENTER MELENDEZ. I THINK

00:47:28.212 --> 00:47:32.482
CHAIR- SO BE THE DOWNTURN IN

00:47:32.549 --> 00:47:33.750
THE LABOR MARKET IN CALIFORNIA

00:47:33.817 --> 00:47:35.986
HAS CERTAINLY INCREASED IN

00:47:36.053 --> 00:47:38.789
SEVERITY. DUE TO THE LOCKDOWN

00:47:38.855 --> 00:47:40.457
DECISIONS BY THE GOVERNOR I'M

00:47:40.524 --> 00:47:41.792
JUST WONDERING IF THE

00:47:41.858 --> 00:47:43.227
DEPARTMENT HAS AN ESTIMATE OF

00:47:43.293 --> 00:47:45.095
HOW MANY WITH THE INCREASES OF

00:47:45.162 --> 00:47:48.198
PEOPLE ON MEDICARE DUE TO JOB

00:47:48.265 --> 00:47:53.470
LOSS. SURE SO I THINK- YOU KNOW

00:47:53.537 --> 00:47:55.739
IT IT'S BEEN INTERESTING FOR US

00:47:55.806 --> 00:47:57.274
TO EVALUATE THE MEDIC CAL

00:47:57.341 --> 00:47:59.810
ENROLLMENT AND THE CURRENT

00:47:59.876 --> 00:48:01.712
ECONOMY I THINK HISTORICAL-

00:48:01.778 --> 00:48:03.513
TRENDS ARE NOT THE SAME THAT

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:04.748
WHAT WE'VE SEEN DURING THE

00:48:04.815 --> 00:48:05.382
PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY

00:48:05.449 --> 00:48:07.317
CLEARLY. ONE THING I WOULD NOTE

00:48:07.384 --> 00:48:09.553
THAT YOU KNOW MEDI CAL HAD BEEN

00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:11.955
SEEN INCREASES IN ENROLLMENT UP

00:48:12.022 --> 00:48:13.023
UNTIL ABOUT EARLY TWO THOUSAND

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:14.791
AND SIXTEEN- AND THEN AS THE

00:48:14.858 --> 00:48:17.027
ECONOMY GOT BETTER- WE HAVE

00:48:17.094 --> 00:48:18.562
SEEN A STEADY DECREASE IN MEDIC

00:48:18.629 --> 00:48:21.198
HOW BETWEEN AT THE BEGINNING OF

00:48:21.265 --> 00:48:21.798
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN RIGHT UP

00:48:21.865 --> 00:48:22.432
UNTIL THE PUBLIC HEALTH

00:48:22.499 --> 00:48:24.434
EMERGENCY HAD STEADILY. BEEN

00:48:24.501 --> 00:48:26.470
DECLINING FOR ABOUT FOUR YEARS

00:48:26.536 --> 00:48:28.505
OUR CURRENT NUMBER SHOWS BACK

00:48:28.572 --> 00:48:29.906
UP AT THE TWO THOUSAND AND

00:48:29.973 --> 00:48:31.208
SIXTEEN PEAK IN REGARDS TO WHEN

00:48:31.275 --> 00:48:32.776
THE ECONOMY WAS AT ITS WORST

00:48:32.843 --> 00:48:34.678
RIGHT SO IT DOES SHOW THAT-

00:48:34.745 --> 00:48:36.913
THAT THAT FACTOR HAS DEFINITELY

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:38.548
INCREASED AND SHOWN A MATIC CAL

00:48:38.615 --> 00:48:40.550
ENROLLMENT- THE TWO BIGGEST

00:48:40.617 --> 00:48:42.185
FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE ALSO IS

00:48:42.252 --> 00:48:43.453
WITH THE CONTINUOUS ENROLLMENT

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:45.088
WE SEE PEOPLE WHO. WILL FOLLOW

00:48:45.155 --> 00:48:46.323
UP OUR PROGRAM BUT THEN MAYBE

00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:47.658
COME BACK ON A YEAR OR TWO

00:48:47.724 --> 00:48:48.759
LATER AND YOU DON'T HAVE THAT

00:48:48.825 --> 00:48:50.160
TURN RIGHT NOW BECAUSE PEOPLE

00:48:50.227 --> 00:48:52.095
ARE STAYING ON THE PROGRAM- AND

00:48:52.162 --> 00:48:53.964
SO YOU HAVEN'T SEEN AS MUCH

00:48:54.031 --> 00:48:55.832
IMPACT FROM THE- THE ECONOMY

00:48:55.899 --> 00:48:57.200
HIT SB ASSUMES WE ACTUALLY

00:48:57.267 --> 00:48:58.402
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HIGHER

00:48:58.468 --> 00:48:59.102
WHICH IS WHY YOU SAW THE

00:48:59.169 --> 00:49:00.470
ADJUSTMENT BETWEEN BUDGET ACTED

00:49:00.537 --> 00:49:02.606
IN NOW- WE'RE TRYING TO TRUE

00:49:02.673 --> 00:49:04.241
THOSE THINGS UP- BUT WE DO

00:49:04.308 --> 00:49:04.875
STILL THINK THERE WILL BE

00:49:04.941 --> 00:49:06.743
CONTINUED GROWTH- WE'VE SEEN

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:07.878
THE LARGEST GROWTH WITHIN THE

00:49:07.944 --> 00:49:10.213
ACA OPTIONAL- ELIGIBILITY

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:12.416
GROUP- AND WE ARE STARTING TO

00:49:12.482 --> 00:49:13.383
SEE THE FAMILY AND CHILD

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:14.751
CATEGORY INCREASE IT HASN'T

00:49:14.818 --> 00:49:16.386
REACHED QUITE THE TWO THOUSAND

00:49:16.453 --> 00:49:17.487
SIXTEEN LEVELS- THAT WE HAD

00:49:17.554 --> 00:49:18.789
SEEN. WHERE THE ECONOMY WAS

00:49:18.855 --> 00:49:21.191
PREVIOUSLY BAD- OR NOT AT THAT

00:49:21.258 --> 00:49:23.093
THE PEAK OF MEDICARE ENROLLMENT

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.895
BUT IT IS IT IS GETTING CLOSE

00:49:24.961 --> 00:49:26.029
WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR VERY

00:49:26.096 --> 00:49:27.631
CLOSELY WE CONTINUE TO WORK

00:49:27.698 --> 00:49:28.532
WITH ADVOCATES VERY CLOSELY

00:49:28.598 --> 00:49:30.400
BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY DID ASSUME

00:49:30.467 --> 00:49:32.469
IT WOULD WOULD BE HIGHER I'M UP

00:49:32.536 --> 00:49:33.236
THERE ARE STILL MANY

00:49:33.303 --> 00:49:34.871
COMPLICATING FACTORS ESTIMATE

00:49:34.938 --> 00:49:40.110
MAYBE WHY IT ISN'T BUT. I WILL

00:49:40.177 --> 00:49:40.677
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH PEOPLE

00:49:40.744 --> 00:49:43.480

DELIVERY SYSTEM AT MEDICARE'S

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:09.579
REALLY COMPLEX- WE. HAVE

01:04:09.645 --> 01:04:10.179

VERY CHALLENGING TO NAVIGATE

01:08:00.743 --> 01:08:02.678
OR PUT INTO. A LONG TERM CARE

01:08:02.745 --> 01:08:05.047
ENVIRONMENTS. IT ALLOWS US TO

01:08:05.114 --> 01:08:06.849
PROVIDE BOTH THE ENHANCED CARE

01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:08.651
MANAGEMENT BUT AS WELL AS THESE

01:08:08.717 --> 01:08:10.953
RAP SERVICES NEEDED ON TO KEEP

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:11.987
SOMEONE EITHER OUT OF AN

01:08:12.054 --> 01:08:13.456
INSTITUTION OR SOMEONE WHO IS

01:08:13.522 --> 01:08:15.324
IN AN INSTITUTION. IF THEY SO

01:08:15.391 --> 01:08:17.726
CHOOSE ALLOW THEM TO TRANSITION

01:08:17.793 --> 01:08:19.495
TO THEIR HOME OR AN ASSISTED

01:08:19.562 --> 01:08:21.197
LIVING ENVIRONMENT WE WOULD PAY

01:08:21.263 --> 01:08:23.065
THE RAP SERVICES WITHIN IN OUR

01:08:23.132 --> 01:08:25.134
SEE IF BEARD ARE. YOU A PAPER

01:08:25.201 --> 01:08:26.502
HOME MODIFICATIONS AT THAT WHAT

01:08:26.569 --> 01:08:27.903
WAS NEEDED FOR THEM TO BE HOME

01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:29.805
SAFELY AS WELL AS MEDICALLY

01:08:29.872 --> 01:08:32.107
TAILORED MEALS SO REALLY ALLOWS

01:08:32.174 --> 01:08:33.442
PEOPLE TO SAFELY RESIDE IN

01:08:33.509 --> 01:08:35.077
THEIR HOME. BOB AND IT HAS

01:08:35.144 --> 01:08:37.480
PROVEN A COST SAVINGS AND

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:39.281
IMPROVED HEALTH OUTCOMES. I

01:08:39.348 --> 01:08:41.484
BRING IT IN THOSE POPULATIONS

01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:43.018
BECAUSE I THINK SOMETIMES A

01:08:43.085 --> 01:08:44.520
CALLIN IS BAKING COMPLEX AND

01:08:44.587 --> 01:08:46.322
IT'S HARD TO KIND OF SEE. THE

01:08:46.388 --> 01:08:48.858
DIRECT IMPACT ON A VERY IS BORN

01:08:48.924 --> 01:08:51.260
ABOUT POPULATIONS. I THINK THAT

01:08:51.327 --> 01:08:52.394
WE HAVE LEARNED A LOT FROM

01:08:52.461 --> 01:08:53.729
COBIT IN REGARDS TO HOW

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:55.698
CRITICAL I'M HAVING SOME OF

01:08:55.764 --> 01:08:57.733
THESE PIECES IN PLACE OF COULD

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:04.707
HELP- TO BE ABLE TO REALLY.

01:09:04.773 --> 01:09:05.307
MOVE THE NEEDLE AND IN SUCH A

01:09:05.374 --> 01:09:06.842
REAL WAY- I THE STATE OF. IF

01:09:06.909 --> 01:09:08.277
ANYTHING IT ALONE HIS. HELPED

01:09:08.344 --> 01:09:09.745
UNDERSCORE THE VALUE OF THE- IN

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:11.947
CALAIS- I THINK WHAT WE WOULD

01:09:12.014 --> 01:09:15.017
ALSO SAY IS- WE ARE NOT A SHY

01:09:15.084 --> 01:09:16.452
TO THINK THIS IS NOT A LARGE

01:09:16.519 --> 01:09:19.522
LIFT IT IS A HEAVY LIFT- AND

01:09:19.588 --> 01:09:21.223
IN. ORDER TO ENSURE SUCCESS WE

01:09:21.290 --> 01:09:23.125
HAVE PUT IN THE PROPOSAL-

01:09:23.192 --> 01:09:26.195
INCENTIVE PAYMENTS- AND- REALLY

01:09:26.262 --> 01:09:27.563
THE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS ARE

01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:30.165
BECAUSE- WE TAKE UP HIGHLIGHTS

01:09:30.232 --> 01:09:31.734
IF YOU TAKE IT STATEWIDE YOU

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:33.235
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE.

01:09:33.302 --> 01:09:34.537
HAVE THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

01:09:34.603 --> 01:09:36.272
THAT THEY NEED- AND WE HAVE

01:09:36.338 --> 01:09:37.339
PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE WE

01:09:37.406 --> 01:09:39.008
DON'T HAVE SOME OF THESE PILOTS

01:09:39.074 --> 01:09:40.609
TODAY AND WE NEED TO BUILD THAT

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:42.111
INFRASTRUCTURE CAPACITY IN

01:09:42.177 --> 01:09:43.846
ACCESS. IN PARTS OF THE STATES

01:09:43.913 --> 01:09:45.447
WHERE WE CLEARLY JUST DON'T

01:09:45.514 --> 01:09:46.715
HAVE IT TODAY. ALSO THE

01:09:46.782 --> 01:09:48.651
INCENTIVE PAYMENTS ARE THERE TO

01:09:48.717 --> 01:09:50.553
DO THAT REALLY TO INCENTIVIZE-

01:09:50.619 --> 01:09:52.655
WHERE WE I. DON'T HAVE ANY

01:09:52.721 --> 01:09:53.923
ACCESS TO THESE TYPES OF IN

01:09:53.989 --> 01:09:55.824
LIEU OF SOURCES OR WE HAVE LOW

01:09:55.891 --> 01:09:57.826
ACCESS INCREASING OR EVEN IN

01:09:57.893 --> 01:09:59.395
URBAN AREAS WHERE WE HAD GREAT

01:09:59.461 --> 01:10:01.130
ACCESS DURING THE PILOT BUT NOT

01:10:01.196 --> 01:10:03.132
ENOUGH. OF FOR THE DEMAND IN

01:10:03.198 --> 01:10:04.867
THAT AREA BUILDING THAT

01:10:04.934 --> 01:10:07.870
INFRASTRUCTURE STATEWIDE- AND-

01:10:07.937 --> 01:10:09.405
ALTERNATELY THE GOAL WOULD BE

01:10:09.471 --> 01:10:10.639
THAT IF WE CAN BUILD STATEWIDE

01:10:10.706 --> 01:10:12.207
INFRASTRUCTURE WE CAN PROVE

01:10:12.274 --> 01:10:14.610
COST EFFECTIVENESS- IN REGARDS

01:10:14.677 --> 01:10:16.345
TO WHAT WE'RE DOING. ULTIMATELY

01:10:16.412 --> 01:10:17.646
EVEN TRANSITIONING SOME OF

01:10:17.713 --> 01:10:19.515
THOSE AND GO UP SERVICES INTO A

01:10:19.582 --> 01:10:21.350
BENEFIT- WHICH CURRENTLY THE

01:10:21.417 --> 01:10:23.519
WAY IT'S PROPOSED IT IS- IT IS

01:10:23.586 --> 01:10:25.554
NOT A BENEFIT IT IS- SOMETHING

01:10:25.621 --> 01:10:26.622
THAT PLAN WOULD HAVE TO OPT

01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:28.757
INTO A PROVIDING A AND THAT'S

01:10:28.824 --> 01:10:29.425
HOW WE GET THE FEDERAL

01:10:29.491 --> 01:10:30.926
AUTHORITY. AND THAT'S REALLY TO

01:10:30.993 --> 01:10:32.294
BUILD THAT INFRASTRUCTURE

01:10:32.361 --> 01:10:34.363
ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:35.764
WE CAN'T GET TO A POINT WHERE

01:10:35.831 --> 01:10:37.132
YOU CAN DEMONSTRATE TO THE

01:10:37.199 --> 01:10:38.334
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT YOU

HAVE. STATEWIDE MESSED. UP IN

01:10:40.369 --> 01:10:42.071
THE OTHER THING I WOULD MENTION

01:10:42.137 --> 01:10:44.373
A QUICKLY IS WITH THE BUILDING

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:45.441

01:11:15.237 --> 01:11:16.305
TO DO THIS WORK THE DEPARTMENT

01:11:16.372 --> 01:11:18.507
IS REQUESTING. A SIXTY NINE

KNOW THIS WORK IS COMPLEX- AND

01:11:32.721 --> 01:11:33.722
THERE ARE SO MANY FACTORS THAT

01:11:33.789 --> 01:11:35.724
ARE INTER DEPENDENT BUT- I

01:11:35.791 --> 01:11:37.593
THINK WE REALLY FEEL LIKE THE

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:39.061
PACKAGE AS A WHOLE. HELPS

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:41.130

ANY QUESTIONS THAT. YOU MAY

01:11:51.373 --> 01:11:51.907
WE HAVE QUITE A FEW QUESTIONS

01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:54.576
BUT JUST JUST THAT. UP THE-

01:11:54.643 --> 01:11:55.811
WHEN YOU WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

01:11:55.878 --> 01:11:58.514
SENIORS AND PACE IS NOT IT'S

01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:00.382
NOT PART OF. GOING TO BE THE

01:12:00.449 --> 01:12:01.717
PART OF THE CAL AIM OR WILL THE

01:12:01.784 --> 01:12:02.951
PACE PROGRAM STILL BE A PART OF

01:12:03.018 --> 01:12:05.220
THAT BECAUSE AT WHAT POINT

01:12:05.287 --> 01:12:05.854
WOULD PEOPLE TRANSITION BETWEEN

01:12:05.921 --> 01:12:07.756
THOSE TWO SYSTEMS. WE WOULD OF

01:12:07.823 --> 01:12:09.825

01:12:09.892 --> 01:12:10.659

REGULATIONS SO ARE THERE.

01:12:13.228 --> 01:12:14.496
DIFFERENT THAN OUR MANAGED CARE

01:12:14.563 --> 01:12:16.699
PLANS HOWEVER WE WOULD. ENSURE

01:12:16.765 --> 01:12:18.133

THE RIGHT TO ENROLL IN A PACE

01:12:19.802 --> 01:12:22.037
ORGANIZATION. A VERY EFFECTIVE

01:12:22.104 --> 01:12:24.273
MODEL OF FOR INDIVIDUALS- AND

01:12:24.339 --> 01:12:25.374
WE WOULD JUST MAKE SURE THAT

01:12:25.441 --> 01:12:26.141

EMPHASIZE A REITERATE BUT I

01:13:39.948 --> 01:13:41.583
THINK- DIRECTOR COOPER DID A

01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:43.752
GREAT JOB OF TOUCHING ON IS

01:13:43.819 --> 01:13:45.621
THAT WHILE MUCH OF TELLING HIS

01:13:45.687 --> 01:13:47.756
NEW MUCH OF CALLING WOULD ALSO

01:13:47.823 --> 01:13:49.858
BUILD UPON OR REPLACE EXISTING

MANAGEMENT IN THEIR SERVICES

01:13:54.663 --> 01:13:56.031
AND THE RELATED INCENTIVE

01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:58.100
PAYMENTS THAT WOULD GO TO

01:13:58.167 --> 01:14:00.435
MANAGED CARE PLANS- BUT TELLING

01:14:00.502 --> 01:14:01.537
DOES NOT REFLECT A MERE

01:14:01.603 --> 01:14:03.505
CONTINUATION OF THESE PROGRAMS

01:14:03.572 --> 01:14:05.574
IT IT REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT

01:14:05.641 --> 01:14:07.142
CHANGE IN THE STATE'S APPROACH

01:14:07.209 --> 01:14:09.211
TO DELIVERING AND FINANCING-

01:14:09.278 --> 01:14:11.079
THE SERVICES THAT CALTRAIN WILL

01:14:11.146 --> 01:14:13.515
AIM TO REPLACE. FIRST UNDER

01:14:13.582 --> 01:14:15.150
KALYAN SIGNIFICAN AND FUNDING

01:14:15.217 --> 01:14:16.652
RESEARCH FUNDING AND

01:14:16.718 --> 01:14:17.820
RESPONSIBILITIES WOULD BE

01:14:17.886 --> 01:14:20.022
CONCENTRATING SHIFTED OVER TO

SECOND THE STATE GENERAL FUND

01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:26.562
WOULD SUPPORT MAJOR NEW TALENT

01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:28.030
SERVICES TO A MUCH GREATER

01:14:28.096 --> 01:14:29.431
DEGREE THAN UNDER EXISTING

01:14:29.498 --> 01:14:31.033
PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THE

01:14:31.099 --> 01:14:34.203
LOCAL FUNDS- PROVIDE A GOOD

01:14:34.269 --> 01:14:35.938
DEAL OF SUPPORT. WE GENERALLY

01:14:36.004 --> 01:14:37.206
FIND THE SHIFT TOWARDS THE

01:14:37.272 --> 01:14:38.807
GENERAL FUND OUT REASONABLE

01:14:38.874 --> 01:14:40.475
GIVEN CALLUM'S PROPOSED DESIGN

01:14:40.542 --> 01:14:42.244
OF GOING STATEWIDE AND SHIFTING

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:43.445
CONTROL REALLY IN SOME WAYS

01:14:43.512 --> 01:14:45.080
AWAY FROM THE LOCALS AND

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:47.449
TOWARDS MANAGED CARE PLANS. AND

01:14:47.516 --> 01:14:48.617
THEN THIRD THOUGH CALTRAIN

01:14:48.684 --> 01:14:50.886
WOULD CHANGE- WOULD

01:14:50.953 --> 01:14:52.254
SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE SORT OF

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:53.856
WHICH FEDERAL FUNDING SOURCES

01:14:53.922 --> 01:14:55.290
OR AFFORD THESE THE STATE WOULD

01:14:55.357 --> 01:14:57.960
USE TO FUND EXPANDED BENEFITS

01:14:58.026 --> 01:14:59.228
AND THIS WITH A LOCK ON LOCK

01:14:59.294 --> 01:15:00.996
ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING FOR

01:15:01.063 --> 01:15:02.965
NON MEDICAL BENEFITS THAT

01:15:03.031 --> 01:15:04.166
HAVEN'T SORT OF BEEN FUNDED

01:15:04.233 --> 01:15:06.668
SORT OF. THROUGH THE MEDICAID

01:15:06.735 --> 01:15:07.436
SORT OF ENTITLEMENT FUNDING

01:15:07.502 --> 01:15:10.172
STRUCTURE PREVIOUSLY AND IT

01:15:10.239 --> 01:15:11.106
WOULD AT THE SAME TIME MAKE%

01:15:11.173 --> 01:15:12.241
FEDERAL FUNDING MORE

01:15:12.307 --> 01:15:14.276
SUSTAINABLE GIVEN CHANGES TO

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:16.745
HOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS

01:15:16.812 --> 01:15:17.613
OVERSEEING ELEVEN FIFTEEN

01:15:17.679 --> 01:15:19.982
WAIVERS. WE FIND THAT CALTRAIN

01:15:20.048 --> 01:15:22.251
HAS POTENTIAL TO BRING MAJOR

01:15:22.317 --> 01:15:24.186
POLICY BENEFITS FOR EXAMPLE

01:15:24.253 --> 01:15:26.288
REDUCING HEALTH DISPARITIES BY

01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:27.589
FOCUSING RESOURCES AND

01:15:27.656 --> 01:15:29.658
ATTENTION ON MEDICARE'S HIGHEST

01:15:29.725 --> 01:15:30.993
HIGHEST RISK IN HIGH SPEED

01:15:31.059 --> 01:15:33.128
BENEFICIARIES. BUT WE DO HAVE

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:34.963
MANY OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS.

01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:36.999
FIRST SIGNIFICANT DETAIL ON

01:15:37.065 --> 01:15:38.400
MAJOR CALLIN COMPONENTS IS

01:15:38.467 --> 01:15:39.635
LACKING LIMITING THE

01:15:39.701 --> 01:15:41.770
LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY TO FULLY

01:15:41.837 --> 01:15:45.507
SCRUTINIZE. ALL THE CHANGES

01:15:45.574 --> 01:15:46.909
THAT ARE PROPOSED. SECOND WHILE

01:15:46.975 --> 01:15:48.343
WE FIND THE GOVERNOR'S SOUTH

01:15:48.410 --> 01:15:49.111
FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO

01:15:49.177 --> 01:15:50.445
MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND

01:15:50.512 --> 01:15:52.447
FUNDING PLAN TO GENERALLY BE

01:15:52.514 --> 01:15:55.350
REASONABLE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE

01:15:55.417 --> 01:15:55.884
TWENTY TWO WE FIND THAT

01:15:55.951 --> 01:15:57.319
CALTRAIN GIVEN IT SCOPE AND

01:15:57.386 --> 01:15:59.321
COMPLEXITY. COMES A SIGNIFICANT

01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:01.890
FISCAL RISKS OVER THE LONG TERM

01:16:01.957 --> 01:16:03.692
UNFORESEEN IMPLEMENTATION COSTS

01:16:03.759 --> 01:16:05.227
COULD MATERIALIZE OVER THE NEXT

01:16:05.294 --> 01:16:07.329
SEVERAL YEARS AND ANTICIPATED

01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:09.097
SAVINGS MAY NOT MATERIALIZE

01:16:09.164 --> 01:16:10.065
QUICKLY ENOUGH FOR IT

01:16:10.132 --> 01:16:11.900
SUFFICIENT LEVELS FOR MULTI

01:16:11.967 --> 01:16:13.235
YEAR FUNDING PLAN TO PROVE

01:16:13.302 --> 01:16:15.470
REASONABLE. THESE LONG TERM

01:16:15.537 --> 01:16:17.572
FISCAL RISKS MERIT ESPECIALLY

01:16:17.639 --> 01:16:19.608
CLOSE ATTENTION GIVEN THE STATE

01:16:19.675 --> 01:16:21.376
BUDGET PROBLEM ANTICIPATED TO

01:16:21.443 --> 01:16:25.213
ARISE AFTER. TWENTY TWENTY ONE

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:26.148
TWENTY TWO. NOT THIRDS AND

01:16:26.214 --> 01:16:28.150
DESPITE THESE FISCAL RISKS WE

01:16:28.216 --> 01:16:29.584
DO BELIEVE CALLIE MERITS

01:16:29.651 --> 01:16:30.953
CONSIDERATION GIVEN ITS

01:16:31.019 --> 01:16:33.021
POTENTIAL POLICY BENEFITS IN

01:16:33.088 --> 01:16:34.456
THE FACT THAT NEW BUT EXISTING

01:16:34.523 --> 01:16:36.325

01:16:36.391 --> 01:16:38.060
PROVIDED UNDER WHOLE PERSON

01:16:38.126 --> 01:16:39.494
CARE AND HEALTH HOMES WOULD

01:16:39.561 --> 01:16:41.296
EXPIRE ABSENT. THEIR

01:16:41.363 --> 01:16:43.398
CONTINUATION IN SOME FORM SUCH

01:16:43.465 --> 01:16:46.101
AS IS PROPOSED UNDER CALLIN.

01:16:46.168 --> 01:16:47.836
JUST CLOSE WITH A FEW ISSUES

01:16:47.903 --> 01:16:50.005
FOR CONSIDERATION OF FIRST WE

01:16:50.072 --> 01:16:51.473
RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE USE

01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:53.008
THE BUDGET AND POLICY PROCESS

01:16:53.075 --> 01:16:54.509

IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES THE

01:17:10.025 --> 01:17:11.893
STATE IS LIKELY TO FACE AS WE

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.729
HOPEFULLY EXIT A PANDEMIC OVER

01:17:13.795 --> 01:17:15.464
THE COMING MONTHS AND YEARS WE

01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:16.398
RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

01:17:16.465 --> 01:17:18.400
EXPLORE WHERE DELAYS IN

01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:20.602
STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION AND

01:17:20.669 --> 01:17:22.671
IMPLEMENTATION ARE ADVISABLE.

01:17:22.738 --> 01:17:24.206
AND THEN THIRD TO ENSURE

WE GET INTO QUESTIONS. NO NOT

01:17:47.963 --> 01:17:49.431
NECESSARILY I MEAN I THINK WHAT

I WOULD SAY IS THAT KHALIMOV

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.101
THE BENEFITS PUT FORWARD ARE

01:17:53.168 --> 01:17:55.003
REALLY MEANT TO BEND THE COST

01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:57.672
CURVE- AND TO BE- IN THE OUT

01:17:57.739 --> 01:17:59.674
YEARS REDUCING OVERALL HEALTH

01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:24.980
INCLUDING GENERAL FUND IN

01:21:25.046 --> 01:21:26.114
REGARDS TO WAYS THAT WE WOULD

01:21:26.181 --> 01:21:28.116
HAVE TO. ADDRESS THAT HOLDEN

01:21:28.183 --> 01:21:30.919
SO- WE STRONGLY THINK THAT-

01:21:30.986 --> 01:21:32.587
THOSE ADDED SHOULD MOVE FORWARD

01:21:32.654 --> 01:21:33.388
AND WE SHOULD TAKE THEM

01:21:33.455 --> 01:21:35.857
STATEWIDE- THE EDGE INSURE THAT

01:21:35.924 --> 01:21:37.459
THERE IS A SUSTAINABLE WAY OF

01:21:37.525 --> 01:21:39.027
PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES ACROSS

01:21:39.094 --> 01:21:40.695
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND

01:21:40.762 --> 01:21:41.963
THE NICE THING ABOUT IN LIEU OF

01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:43.632
SERVICES BEING OPTIONAL IS IT

01:21:43.698 --> 01:21:45.100
ALLOWS US TO PHASES IN OVER

01:21:45.166 --> 01:21:47.936
TIME ALLOWS US TO LEARN WHAT IS

01:21:48.003 --> 01:21:49.337
WHERE WE'RE FINDING SUCCESSES

01:21:49.404 --> 01:21:51.006
AND THEN WHERE WE ARE AND WHERE

01:21:51.072 --> 01:21:53.208
WE SEE THAT THEY ARE- CLEARLY

01:21:53.275 --> 01:21:55.744
DEMONSTRATING IMPROVED OUTCOMES

01:21:55.810 --> 01:21:57.312
FOR BENEFICIARIES CAN MAKE

01:21:57.379 --> 01:21:58.013
DECISIONS OF COURSE WITH THE

01:21:58.079 --> 01:22:00.015
LEGISLATURE- IN REGARDS TO

01:22:00.081 --> 01:22:01.783
MAKING THOSE. THOSE BENEFITS-

01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:04.252
SO I THINK WE TRIED TO OF PHASE

01:22:04.319 --> 01:22:05.920
IN WE'VE TRIED TO ACCOUNT FOR

01:22:05.987 --> 01:22:07.455
THOSE TYPES TRANSITIONS WILL

01:22:07.522 --> 01:22:09.791
NOT CREATING. UNNECESSARY

01:22:09.858 --> 01:22:12.560
CLIFFS WERE KEY PARTNERS- IN

01:22:12.627 --> 01:22:14.496
OUR MEDIC CAL DELIVERY SYSTEM

01:22:14.562 --> 01:22:16.765
AND HE DID DO THIS AS AS

01:22:16.831 --> 01:22:21.770
APPROPRIATELY AS WE CAN- WELL

01:22:21.836 --> 01:22:23.004
WE TAKE IT STATEWIDE. AND PETER

01:22:23.071 --> 01:22:24.639
GUBER BOUT THE INCENTIVE PAY.

01:22:24.706 --> 01:22:25.807
FOR MEDICARE BECAUSE BECAUSE

01:22:25.874 --> 01:22:27.742
THAT IS THEN THE INCENTIVIZE IS

01:22:27.809 --> 01:22:29.844
TICKETS TO GO TO THE ENHANCED

01:22:29.911 --> 01:22:32.080
CASE MANAGEMENT CORRECT. YES OF

01:22:32.147 --> 01:22:33.181
THE INCENTIVE DOLLARS ARE

01:22:33.248 --> 01:22:35.817
REALLY TO BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE-

01:22:35.884 --> 01:22:37.252
IN THE STATE FOR BOTH THE

01:22:37.319 --> 01:22:38.553
ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT WHERE

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:39.954
DOESN'T EXIST TODAY AS WELL AS

01:22:40.021 --> 01:22:42.257
THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES. FOR

01:22:42.324 --> 01:22:44.426
EXAMPLE- ONE OF THE PIECES THAT

01:22:44.492 --> 01:22:46.194
WE ARE LOOKING TO DO WITH THE

01:22:46.261 --> 01:22:47.862
INCENTIVES IS SAYING YOU KNOW.

01:22:47.929 --> 01:22:49.631
IF YOU CAN INCREASE THE NUMBER

01:22:49.698 --> 01:22:51.499
OF RECUPERATIVE CARE BEDS

01:22:51.566 --> 01:22:53.968
AVAILABLE IN YOUR COUNTY WOULD

01:22:54.035 --> 01:22:54.803
BE ABLE TO RECEIVE AN INCENTIVE

01:22:54.869 --> 01:22:57.005
PAYMENT. RECUPERATIVE CARE BEDS

01:22:57.072 --> 01:22:58.740
FOR EXAMPLE ARE REALLY CRITICAL

01:22:58.807 --> 01:22:59.441
BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

01:22:59.507 --> 01:23:01.409
HOMELESS YOU I'M GOING TO IN

01:23:01.476 --> 01:23:02.911

01:23:02.977 --> 01:23:04.979
IN AN INPATIENT BED FOR. WEEKS

01:23:05.046 --> 01:23:07.115
AND SOMETIMES MONTHS BECAUSE

01:23:07.182 --> 01:23:08.283
THEY CANNOT APPROPRIATELY

01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:10.218
TRANSITION SOMEBODY TO THE

01:23:10.285 --> 01:23:11.052
STREET GIVEN THEIR CURRENT

01:23:11.119 --> 01:23:12.854
HEALTH CONDITION. THAT ALLOWS

01:23:12.921 --> 01:23:14.155
SOMEONE TO TRANSITION FROM THAT

01:23:14.222 --> 01:23:16.224
IMPATIENCE DAY- INTO A

01:23:16.291 --> 01:23:18.026
RECUPERATIVE CARE BEDS SO THE

01:23:18.093 --> 01:23:19.060
INCENTIVES WOULD BE AROUND

01:23:19.127 --> 01:23:20.762
BUILDING THAT INFRASTRUCTURE

01:23:20.829 --> 01:23:22.364
AND CAPACITY ACROSS THE STATE

01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:24.299
OF CALIFORNIA- WHICH IS REALLY

01:23:24.366 --> 01:23:26.167
CRITICAL. OF THE ALSO WOULD

01:23:26.234 --> 01:23:28.103
FOCUS ON CERTAIN OUTCOMES SO

01:23:28.169 --> 01:23:29.671
INCREASING ACCESS TO THE

01:23:29.738 --> 01:23:31.906

01:23:31.973 --> 01:23:34.209
GETTING- THE PENETRATION THAT

01:23:34.275 --> 01:23:35.543
WE WANT IT WOULD IT COULD

01:23:35.610 --> 01:23:36.945
INCLUDE THINGS LIKE TRAINING

01:23:37.011 --> 01:23:38.480
INITIATIVES FOR ENHANCED CARE

01:23:38.546 --> 01:23:40.315
MANAGEMENT. IN ORDER TO DO

01:23:40.382 --> 01:23:41.216
ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT IS A

01:23:41.282 --> 01:23:42.784
COMBINATION OF BOTH CLINICAL

01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:44.452
AND NONCLINICAL WHERE WE WORK

01:23:44.519 --> 01:23:45.620
WITH COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS

01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:47.522
AND PEERS. BOB AND IT'S REALLY

01:23:47.589 --> 01:23:48.690
CRITICAL THAT THEY HAVE

01:23:48.757 --> 01:23:49.691
TRAINING MECHANISM SO WE CAN

01:23:49.758 --> 01:23:52.594
INCENTIVIZE- THESE TRAINING.

01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:53.895

IN REGARDS TO THAT WORKFORCE-

01:23:57.832 --> 01:24:00.769
EFFORTS- THAT WOULD BE. NEEDED

01:24:00.835 --> 01:24:03.071
AS WELL AS ACTUAL QUALITY

01:24:03.138 --> 01:24:04.639
OUTCOMES WILL HAVE MEASURES FOR

01:24:04.706 --> 01:24:06.875

THAT THE MANAGED CARE PLAN

01:32:17.131 --> 01:32:17.598

01:32:19.133 --> 01:32:20.668
INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE PLAN

01:32:20.735 --> 01:32:22.169
LEVEL BUT MOST OF IT BEING

01:32:22.236 --> 01:32:24.672
COMMUNITY BASED. ON IN PERSON-

01:32:24.739 --> 01:32:26.607
TO BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS-

01:32:26.674 --> 01:32:28.042
AND THEN WE WILL BUILD IN THE A

01:32:28.109 --> 01:32:30.011

PLACE THE PILOTS FOR ABOUT.

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:40.821
FIVE YEARS APPROXIMATELY BRENT

01:32:40.888 --> 01:32:43.424
YEAH RIGHT. YEAH WE'RE IN THE

01:32:43.491 --> 01:32:44.392
SIX YOU'RE TECHNICALLY BUT IT

01:32:44.458 --> 01:32:45.359
TOOK TIME TO GET THEM UP AND

01:32:45.426 --> 01:32:47.094
RUNNING SO- I THINK WEARING

01:32:47.161 --> 01:32:48.562
YOUR FOR OF OPERATIONALLY

01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:50.398
PAYING FOR THE SERVICES YEAH.

01:32:50.464 --> 01:32:52.233
OKAY SO I KNOW MY COUNTY AND

01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:54.635
SACRAMENTO COUNTY ARE BOTH ARE

01:32:54.702 --> 01:32:56.404
BOTH PART OF IT. AND NOW IT.

01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:57.505
YOU KNOW WHEN I AND I WOULD

01:32:57.571 --> 01:32:58.506
JUST OFFER THE LAST FIVE YEARS

01:32:58.572 --> 01:32:59.840
I THINK PEOPLE WOULD SAY THAT

01:32:59.907 --> 01:33:00.508
THAT THE PROBLEMS HAVE

01:33:00.574 --> 01:33:02.143
INCREASED. AS FAR AS THE VISUAL

01:33:02.209 --> 01:33:03.644
PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING

01:33:03.711 --> 01:33:05.046
THAT THAT WE CONTINUE TO HEAR

01:33:05.112 --> 01:33:06.447
ABOUT HOMELESS ON THE STREET. A

01:33:06.514 --> 01:33:07.748
LACK OF HOUSING ALL OF THOSE

01:33:07.815 --> 01:33:09.917
THINGS. SO IF IN THE TWO

01:33:09.984 --> 01:33:11.218
COUNTIES THAT I'M BY DRIVE IN

01:33:11.285 --> 01:33:13.988
EVERY DAY. I'M NOT SEEING

01:33:16.223 --> 01:33:17.692
ME HOW CONTINUING ON THIS IS

01:33:17.758 --> 01:33:18.426
GOING TO HELP YOU THE MORE FOR

01:33:18.492 --> 01:33:21.562
WHAT WE'VE BEEN MISSING. IN THE

01:33:21.629 --> 01:33:22.563
WHOLE PERSON PLANS BEFORE. SO I

01:33:22.630 --> 01:33:24.031
THINK ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES IS

01:33:24.098 --> 01:33:25.599
WHAT WHOLE PERSON CARE TO PILOT

01:33:25.666 --> 01:33:27.902
SO EACH COUNTY WAS ABLE TO PICK

01:33:27.969 --> 01:33:29.937
DIFFERENT TARGET POPULATIONS-

01:33:30.004 --> 01:33:32.006
AND PICK DIFFERENT INITIATIVES-

01:33:32.073 --> 01:33:33.441
AND WHAT WE TRY TO DO WITH

01:33:33.507 --> 01:33:36.277
CALLIE. IS LOOK ACROSS THE

01:33:36.344 --> 01:33:37.578
PROGRAMS OF WHAT WE'RE THE BEST

01:33:37.645 --> 01:33:39.914
PRACTICES WHAT WE'RE THE BEST-

01:33:39.981 --> 01:33:42.249
A PACKAGE OF SERVICES- BUNDLED

01:33:42.316 --> 01:33:44.652
TOGETHER- THAT. REALLY ALLOWED

01:33:44.719 --> 01:33:46.420
US TO MOVE THE NEEDLE AND

01:33:46.487 --> 01:33:47.722
THAT'S WHAT WE ENDED UP PUTTING

01:33:47.788 --> 01:33:49.991
INTO CALLING- I THINK IT'S ONE

01:33:50.057 --> 01:33:51.826
OF THE- THE THINGS WITH PILOTS

01:33:51.892 --> 01:33:53.527
IS. EVERYBODY'S TESTING

01:33:53.594 --> 01:33:55.329
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT APPROACHES

01:33:55.396 --> 01:33:57.365
AND A COMBINATION OF THINGS.

01:33:57.431 --> 01:33:58.899
AND SO BY HAVING THE FULL

01:33:58.966 --> 01:34:00.835
PACKAGE OF IN LIEU OF SERVICES

01:34:00.901 --> 01:34:02.470
THE NAVIGATION THE DEPOSITS.

01:34:02.536 --> 01:34:03.904
THE TNDENCY AS WELL AS

01:34:03.971 --> 01:34:05.940
RECUPERATIVE CARE. I'M IN OTHER

01:34:06.007 --> 01:34:07.274
PIECES YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE

01:34:07.341 --> 01:34:09.477
FULL CONTINUUM. I'M AND SO WHAT

01:34:09.543 --> 01:34:11.178
WE'RE REALLY HOPING IS THAT.

01:34:11.245 --> 01:34:12.513
PEOPLE WILL EMBRACE THAT

01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:13.714
CONTINUUM OF SERVICES THAT

01:34:13.781 --> 01:34:14.849
ALLOWS YOU HAVE THE STEP DOWN

01:34:14.915 --> 01:34:17.418
AND REALLY MAXIMIZE THE SCENES-

01:34:17.485 --> 01:34:19.587
AND I ALSO THINK THAT. A LOT OF

01:34:19.653 --> 01:34:21.055
THE STUFF AND WHOLE PERSON CARE

01:34:21.122 --> 01:34:22.023
IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:34:22.089 --> 01:34:24.225
MAKES IT VULNERABLE. IS IT IS

01:34:24.291 --> 01:34:26.861
DEPENDENT ON LOCAL FUNDING-

01:34:26.927 --> 01:34:30.164
AND- IN BEAUTY I TO DRIVE TO-

01:34:30.231 --> 01:34:31.532
SUSTAINABILITY TO DRIVE TO

01:34:31.599 --> 01:34:33.000
STATEWIDE IS. GOING THROUGH THE

01:34:33.067 --> 01:34:34.368
MANAGED CARE PLANS WHERE THERE

01:34:34.435 --> 01:34:35.469
ARE CLEAR CONTRACTUAL

01:34:35.536 --> 01:34:37.905
OBLIGATIONS NO LONGER A PILOT.

01:34:37.972 --> 01:34:40.007
SUBJECT TO LOCAL FUNDING- WE

01:34:40.074 --> 01:34:41.175
ARE THERE WOULD BE EXPECTATIONS

01:34:41.242 --> 01:34:42.676
THAT WOULD NEED TO BE THAT

01:34:42.743 --> 01:34:43.744
THERE WOULD BE MONITORING AND

01:34:43.811 --> 01:34:46.781
ACCOUNTABILITY- AND TRACKING OF

01:34:46.847 --> 01:34:49.016
THOSE PIECES AND SO I THINK.

01:34:49.083 --> 01:34:50.317
THAT'S WHY WE PROPOSED THE

01:34:50.384 --> 01:34:51.786
STRUCTURE AND THE CHANGE FROM A

01:34:51.852 --> 01:34:53.854
LOCAL- KIND OF FUNDED

01:34:53.921 --> 01:34:55.756
INITIATIVE- THAT'S PILOTED AND

01:34:55.823 --> 01:34:57.324
BERRIES AND ONLY MAYBE HAS

01:34:57.391 --> 01:34:58.325
CERTAIN COMPONENTS IN CERTAIN

01:34:58.392 --> 01:35:01.429
COUNTIES- TO. A MORE STATE WIDE

01:35:01.495 --> 01:35:03.064
SUSTAINABLE STRUCTURE THAT

01:35:03.130 --> 01:35:05.666
ALLOWS FOR- YES INVESTMENT IN

01:35:05.733 --> 01:35:07.635
GENERAL FUND BUT ULTIMATELY A

01:35:07.701 --> 01:35:10.204
MORE KIND OF. IMPROVE OUTCOME-

01:35:10.271 --> 01:35:11.172
WHAT WE PULLED THE BEST

01:35:11.238 --> 01:35:12.873
PRACTICES WE CAN'T FROM. WHERE

01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:14.041
WE HAVE SEEN GREAT SUCCESS IN

01:35:14.108 --> 01:35:15.342
THE STATE. OKAYAND THEN JUST

01:35:15.409 --> 01:35:17.078
ONE. FINAL QUESTION FOR I TURN

01:35:17.144 --> 01:35:23.084
TO DOCTOR PANEL- CENTER

01:35:23.150 --> 01:35:24.618
MELENDEZ- SO I. MEAN I WAS IN

01:35:24.685 --> 01:35:25.252
THE NINETIES IN I WAS PART OF A

01:35:25.319 --> 01:35:25.886
OF VALUE. LOOKING AT THIS. THIS

01:35:25.953 --> 01:35:28.889
CALL. IN IN- IN OREGON- BUT

01:35:28.956 --> 01:35:30.391
CHAO WELFARE SYSTEM. SO WE

01:35:30.458 --> 01:35:31.392
WE'VE BEEN DOING THESE PILOTS

01:35:31.459 --> 01:35:32.560
FOREVER RIGHT WILL WE REALIZE

01:35:32.626 --> 01:35:34.628
THAT WE CAN'T JUST TREAT ONCE

01:35:34.695 --> 01:35:36.263
WHEN PART OF A PERSON WE HAVE

01:35:36.330 --> 01:35:36.864
TO TREAT THE WHOLE PERSON IN

01:35:36.931 --> 01:35:38.299
THE WHOLE SYSTEM. THAT THEY

01:35:38.365 --> 01:35:40.768
LIVE IN- SO WHY ARE WE READY

01:35:40.835 --> 01:35:41.735
NOW RIGHT WE'VE BEEN TRYING

01:35:41.802 --> 01:35:43.804
THIS FOR EVER AND THEN STARTS

01:35:43.871 --> 01:35:46.273
AND FITS AND PILOTS AND- PILOTS

01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:51.412
AND- AND NOW WE'RE READY. THANK

01:35:51.479 --> 01:35:54.215
WELL I WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT.

01:35:54.281 --> 01:35:55.082
WELL WE'VE BEEN DOING THE

01:35:55.149 --> 01:35:56.484
PILOTS FOR A LONG TIME WE'VE

01:35:56.550 --> 01:35:58.452
SEEN A LOT OF SUCCESSFUL PILOTS

01:35:58.519 --> 01:36:02.289
AS WELL- AND TAKING THAT ON A

01:36:02.356 --> 01:36:05.226
STATEWIDE BASIS- IN ENSURING

01:36:05.292 --> 01:36:07.261
THAT WE ARE. MAKING THESE

01:36:07.328 --> 01:36:08.262
SERVICES BUT I THINK THAT THE

01:36:08.329 --> 01:36:09.697
COMBINATION OF BRINGING THE

01:36:09.763 --> 01:36:11.932
MEDICAL AND THE SOCIAL SIDE- IN

01:36:11.999 --> 01:36:13.801
LOOKING AT THE WHOLE PERSON THE

01:36:13.868 --> 01:36:15.870
VALUE OF THAT IS SIGNIFICANT

01:36:15.936 --> 01:36:18.005
AND I THINK- NOW WILL THE

01:36:18.072 --> 01:36:19.707
MOMENT IT'S CLEAR I THINK. I

01:36:19.773 --> 01:36:21.308
CAN'T EVEN STRESS THE LESSONS

01:36:21.375 --> 01:36:22.376
LEARNED THAT WE'VE HAD THROUGH

01:36:22.443 --> 01:36:24.278
CODED IN REGARDS TO THERE'S

01:36:24.345 --> 01:36:25.346
BEEN MOMENTS WHERE WE'RE SAYING

01:36:25.412 --> 01:36:27.148
IF WE REALLY JUST HAD CALAIS

01:36:27.214 --> 01:36:29.016
MAINE PLACE. THINK ABOUT THE

01:36:29.083 --> 01:36:30.351
RESPONSE TO THE HOMELESS THAT

01:36:30.417 --> 01:36:31.585
WE COULD HAVE HAD ACROSS THE

01:36:31.652 --> 01:36:33.087
STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO MOVE

01:36:33.154 --> 01:36:34.889
QUICKLY ON THE HOUSING

01:36:34.955 --> 01:36:37.491
COMPONENTS IN HERE- WE HAVE TO

01:36:37.558 --> 01:36:39.059
START BUILDING- BE

01:36:39.126 --> 01:36:41.028
INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS THE STATE

01:36:41.095 --> 01:36:42.630
NOW WE HAVE TO FIND WHERE THERE

01:36:42.696 --> 01:36:44.832
ARE GAPS- TO START MOVING THE

01:36:44.899 --> 01:36:46.033
NEEDLE BECAUSE IF WE JUST KEEP

01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:47.768
PUTTING IT OFF I THINK THAT.

01:36:47.835 --> 01:36:49.637
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEE-

01:36:49.703 --> 01:36:51.005
THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS INCREASE

01:36:51.071 --> 01:36:53.040
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEE.

01:36:53.107 --> 01:36:55.376
AN INCREASE OF- YOU KNOW

01:36:55.442 --> 01:36:56.810
WHETHER IT'S SUICIDE RATES OR

01:36:56.877 --> 01:36:59.113
INCREASE MENTAL HEALTH- ISSUES

01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:00.281
THAT ARE NOT BEING ADDRESSED I

01:37:00.347 --> 01:37:03.184
THINK WE HAVE TO KIND TO INVEST

01:37:03.250 --> 01:37:05.219
THE FUNDS NOW TO START SEEING

01:37:05.286 --> 01:37:07.154
CHANGES OUT THE DELIVERY SYSTEM

01:37:07.221 --> 01:37:08.589
AND IT WILL TAKE TIME IT'S NOT

01:37:08.656 --> 01:37:10.291
GOING TO HAPPEN OVERNIGHT- BUT

01:37:10.357 --> 01:37:12.626
I THINK THAT NOW. IS REALLY

01:37:12.693 --> 01:37:14.361
CRITICAL ESPECIALLY- WHAT WE

01:37:14.428 --> 01:37:16.197
LEARNED DURING THE PUBLIC

01:37:16.263 --> 01:37:17.865
HEALTH EMERGENCY AND HAVING

01:37:17.932 --> 01:37:20.201
THESE PIECES. THE CONNECTION OF

01:37:20.267 --> 01:37:22.636
HEALTH AND SOCIAL- REALLY I

01:37:22.703 --> 01:37:25.139
HIGHLIGHTED- INVALIDATING THAT

01:37:25.206 --> 01:37:28.876
IS CRITICAL. AT THIS TIME AND

01:37:28.943 --> 01:37:29.476
THE PLANTS ARE READY. YOU KNOW

01:37:29.543 --> 01:37:31.178
I THINK THAT- THE PLANS ARE

01:37:31.245 --> 01:37:33.047
VERY EXCITED ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE

01:37:33.113 --> 01:37:34.281
INCLUDE SERVICES PLANS HAVE

01:37:34.348 --> 01:37:35.349
BEEN PUSHING FOR US TO

01:37:35.416 --> 01:37:37.918
IMPLEMENT FOR HER YEARS. OF

01:37:37.985 --> 01:37:38.986
BECAUSE OF THE LEARNING THEIR

01:37:39.053 --> 01:37:40.254
RIGHT ESPECIALLY AROUND THE

01:37:40.321 --> 01:37:42.790
AGING POPULATION AND HOW-

01:37:42.856 --> 01:37:44.458
SUCCESSFUL CAN BE AT REDUCING

01:37:44.525 --> 01:37:46.293
COSTS. I THINK THAT THAT'S WHY

01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:47.861
WE ARE PUTTING INCENTIVE

01:37:47.928 --> 01:37:48.796
DOLLARS IN TO MAKE SURE WE

01:37:48.862 --> 01:37:50.864

01:37:50.931 --> 01:37:52.499
ASSISTANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY

01:37:52.566 --> 01:37:54.535
WITH THE MANAGED CARE PLANS-

01:37:54.602 --> 01:37:56.804

01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:57.771
CLOSELY WITH THEM TO MOVE THE

01:37:57.838 --> 01:37:59.773
NEEDLE BUT- I'VE YET TO HEAR

PLAN SAY THAT DAY- PART EXCITED

01:38:02.509 --> 01:38:04.678
ABOUT TELLING. IT'S MORE OF WHY

01:38:04.745 --> 01:38:06.313
WE PUT PHASING IN PLACE JUST TO

01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:07.348
MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN BE AS

01:38:07.414 --> 01:38:09.049
SUCCESSFUL AS POSSIBLE. IN

01:38:09.116 --> 01:38:10.618
DOING THIS OVER A PERIOD OF

01:38:10.684 --> 01:38:11.952
TIME INSTEAD OF EVERYTHING

01:38:12.019 --> 01:38:15.122
GOING ON AT ONCE. THANK YOU.

01:38:32.006 --> 01:38:34.742
IMPLEMENTATION OF SOME OF THE

01:38:34.808 --> 01:38:37.311
WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS AND-

01:38:37.378 --> 01:38:39.179
WELL THERE MAY BE AN OUT THERE

01:38:39.246 --> 01:38:41.048
ARE SUCCESSES ARE ALSO A

01:38:41.115 --> 01:38:44.051
SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES- AND- WE

01:38:44.118 --> 01:38:44.518
DID HAVE PEOPLE HAVING

01:38:44.585 --> 01:38:47.655
PROBLEMS- BUT I DO I SAY THAT

01:38:47.721 --> 01:38:50.457
IS. OVERALL AND A JUST EXPRESS

01:38:50.524 --> 01:38:51.992

ACCOMPLISH THAT- ONE OF THINGS

01:38:58.132 --> 01:39:01.135
THAT I. THINK OVERALL- THERE'S

01:39:01.201 --> 01:39:03.037
A LOT THAT'S BEING EXPECTED OF

01:39:03.103 --> 01:39:04.972
THE MANAGED CARE PLANS AND ARE

01:39:05.039 --> 01:39:06.473
AND SO I GUESS MY FIRST

01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:09.677
STATEMENT IS THAT- ONE THING

01:39:09.743 --> 01:39:10.611
THAT'S GONNA BE ESSENTIAL TO

01:39:10.678 --> 01:39:13.314
MAKING THE SUCCESSFUL IS-

01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:16.817
OVERSIGHT- AND CUT AND

01:39:16.884 --> 01:39:20.321
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THIS AND

01:39:20.387 --> 01:39:22.389
THIS IS- BEFORE YOUR TIME ON

01:39:22.456 --> 01:39:24.558
THIS COOPER BUT- THAT YOU DON'T

01:39:24.625 --> 01:39:25.693
WANT TO SHARE THE SIMPLY

01:39:25.759 --> 01:39:27.628
COMMITTEE AND THEN LATER HERE

01:39:27.695 --> 01:39:30.731
IN THE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE-

01:39:30.798 --> 01:39:32.833
YOU KNOW- BUT I'VE ALWAYS SAID

01:39:32.900 --> 01:39:35.936
THAT WE CAN'T CONTRACT OUT

01:39:36.003 --> 01:39:38.138
RESPONSIBILITY. SO THAT THE

01:39:38.205 --> 01:39:40.174
AGENCY NEEDS TO BE ACCOUNTABLE

01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:42.409
TO US AND- I NEVER WANT TO HEAR

01:39:42.476 --> 01:39:45.079
THAT WELL THE PLAN DID THAT. IT

01:39:45.145 --> 01:39:46.613
WASN'T US BECAUSE WE'RE THE

01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:48.115
ONES WHO MADE THE CONTRACT

01:39:48.182 --> 01:39:50.017
WOULD WANT TO SIGN THE CONTRACT

01:39:50.084 --> 01:39:52.019
INCLUDING ANY CONSEQUENCES THAT

01:39:52.086 --> 01:39:53.153
ARE EMBEDDED IN THE CONTRACT

01:39:53.220 --> 01:39:54.822
FOR FAILURE STEP WITH. THAT MAY

01:39:54.888 --> 01:39:58.058
HAPPEN AND- SO I JUST WANTED.

01:39:58.125 --> 01:39:59.727
FIRST OF ALL MAKE THAT CLEAR

01:39:59.793 --> 01:40:01.762
THAT JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE A

01:40:01.829 --> 01:40:03.964
MANAGED CARE PLAN DO IT- WE

01:40:04.031 --> 01:40:05.666
STILL ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

01:40:05.733 --> 01:40:08.769
OUTCOMES- DIRECTLY. CAN'T BLAME

01:40:08.836 --> 01:40:10.604
THE PLAN NOW THE PLAN MAY HAVE

01:40:10.671 --> 01:40:13.507
HAD SOME FAULT BUT AGAIN WE'RE

01:40:13.574 --> 01:40:14.074
THE ONES WITH CON WE'RE THE

01:40:14.141 --> 01:40:16.643
ONES WHO MADE CONTRACT- SO

01:40:16.710 --> 01:40:18.712
FIRST OF ALL- RIGHT. ONE

01:40:18.779 --> 01:40:21.048
QUESTION IS- PART OF WHAT WE'RE

01:40:21.115 --> 01:40:22.583
PROPOSING IS TO INCLUDE

01:40:22.649 --> 01:40:24.318
ESSENTIALLY LONG TERM CARE AND

01:40:24.385 --> 01:40:27.020
LTSS SERVICES INTO THE MANSION

01:40:27.087 --> 01:40:29.857
CARE- ESSENTIALLY CARVE THE MEN

01:40:29.923 --> 01:40:31.725
AND THE MANAGED CARE BENEFIT.

01:40:31.792 --> 01:40:33.360
WE ESTABLISH OUR CAPITATION

01:40:33.427 --> 01:40:36.263
RATES- FOR THE DIFFERENT PLANS

01:40:36.330 --> 01:40:38.198
LONG TERM CARE IS SOMETHING

01:40:38.265 --> 01:40:40.200
THAT'S MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE-

01:40:40.267 --> 01:40:42.903
AND- SO. IS THERE SEPARATE

01:40:42.970 --> 01:40:45.272
CAPITATION RATE FOR THE PEOPLE

01:40:45.339 --> 01:40:47.007
AND WHO REQUIRE LONG TERM CARE

01:40:47.074 --> 01:40:48.742
SERVICES FROM THE REST OF THE

01:40:48.809 --> 01:40:51.712
POPULATION- IN THAT PLAN ARE

01:40:51.779 --> 01:40:53.714
THERE SOME WAYS SO THAT WE CAN

01:40:53.781 --> 01:40:54.848
TEAR THAT OUT SO THAT WE DON'T

01:40:54.915 --> 01:40:56.383
HAVE A SENSE OF THE TAIL

01:40:56.450 --> 01:40:58.285
WAGGING THE DOG- WE MEAN BY

01:40:58.352 --> 01:41:00.154
THAT IS THAT. THE AMOUNT OF

01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:01.188
EXPENDITURES FOR SOMEONE

01:41:01.255 --> 01:41:02.156
REQUIRES LONG TERM CARE

01:41:02.222 --> 01:41:03.824
SERVICES IS MUCH HIGHER THAN

01:41:03.891 --> 01:41:06.059
LET'S SAY A CHILD OR A WORKING

01:41:06.126 --> 01:41:07.928
ADULT AND SO FORTH AND- IF WE

01:41:07.995 --> 01:41:10.864
ONLY GIVE ONE. OVERALL

01:41:10.931 --> 01:41:12.966
CAPITATION RATE- YOU COULD WE

01:41:13.033 --> 01:41:14.168
COULD HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE

01:41:14.234 --> 01:41:16.470
SEE BASICALLY THE PLANS DRIVEN

01:41:16.537 --> 01:41:19.673
BY- THAT ONE POPULATION AND-

01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:21.308
THE OTHER POPULATIONS PERHAPS

01:41:21.375 --> 01:41:23.444
BEING EVEN SHORTAGE BECAUSE IF

01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:24.711
IT IF IN ORDER TO MAKE ALL THE

01:41:24.778 --> 01:41:27.314
BOOKS WORK OUT. SO I JUST WANNA

01:41:27.381 --> 01:41:28.816
BE CAREFUL THAT WE DON'T CREATE

01:41:28.882 --> 01:41:30.417
A TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM THAT

01:41:30.484 --> 01:41:34.288
BASICALLY- CREATES-

01:41:34.354 --> 01:41:36.690
DYSFUNCTIONAL IT SAID WELL I

01:41:36.757 --> 01:41:39.059
GUESS INCENTIVE TO CREATE. THAT

01:41:39.126 --> 01:41:40.828
DRIVES DECISION MAKING THAT-

01:41:40.894 --> 01:41:44.731
THAT THAT MAY- NOT NECESSARILY-

01:41:44.798 --> 01:41:47.100
BE BENEFICIAL FOR THE ENTIRE

01:41:47.167 --> 01:41:49.703
POPULATION AND- SO NOT UNITING

01:41:49.770 --> 01:41:50.971
THAT YOU HAVE YOU KNOW A SUB

01:41:51.038 --> 01:41:53.006
SEGMENT THAT HAS IS MUCH MORE

01:41:53.073 --> 01:41:55.142
EXPENSIVE STAND OTHER. GROUPS

01:41:55.209 --> 01:41:56.743
THAT WE DON'T HAVE A SITUATION

01:41:56.810 --> 01:41:59.246
WHERE- WHAT'S WRITTEN ONE WAY

01:41:59.313 --> 01:42:01.048
SO CAN YOU JUST SPEAK TO HOW

01:42:01.114 --> 01:42:02.883
HOW HOW HOW WE'RE GONNA HANDLE

01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:05.152
THE PAYMENTS. FOR CARVING IN

01:42:05.219 --> 01:42:08.489
LONG TERM CARE- INTO IT HI HOW

01:42:08.555 --> 01:42:10.090
ARE YOU PLANNING TO ESTABLISH

01:42:10.157 --> 01:42:14.528
OUR- CAPITA PAYMENTS TO THE

01:42:14.595 --> 01:42:16.163
PLANS. BURKE SO- I WOULD THINK

01:42:16.230 --> 01:42:17.898
WOULD SAY IS DO HAVE PLANS TO

01:42:17.965 --> 01:42:19.132
HAVE LONG TERM CARE CARVED INTO

01:42:19.199 --> 01:42:21.168
DAY- IN THEIR RESPONSIBILITY SO

01:42:21.235 --> 01:42:22.603
WE DO HAVE EXPERIENCE FROM FROM

01:42:22.669 --> 01:42:24.104
THAT PERSPECTIVE- WE ARE

01:42:24.171 --> 01:42:26.773
PROPOSING A BLENDED RATE WITH

01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:29.543
LONG TERM CARE AND S. B. THE

01:42:29.610 --> 01:42:31.278
SPD POPULATION. IF THERE'S

01:42:31.345 --> 01:42:32.212
QUESTIONS WEARING THAT I KNOW

01:42:32.279 --> 01:42:33.814
IN THE HERINGTON IS ON AND SHE

01:42:33.881 --> 01:42:35.616
CAN SPEAK TO THOSE THE ONE

01:42:35.682 --> 01:42:36.884
THING I WOULD SAY THOUGH RIGHT

01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:39.419
NOW OF WHERE WE DON'T HAVE THE

01:42:39.486 --> 01:42:41.054
INCENTIVE FROM THE HOT-

01:42:41.121 --> 01:42:42.623
HEALTHCARE PERSPECTIVE. WHEN

01:42:42.689 --> 01:42:44.525
LONG TERM CARE IS CARVED IN AND

01:42:44.591 --> 01:42:46.460
WE PROVIDE THEM DELUDE SERVICES

01:42:46.527 --> 01:42:47.661
THAT ALLOW THEM TO TRANSITION

01:42:47.728 --> 01:42:49.429
SOMEONE FROM A LONG TERM CARE

01:42:49.496 --> 01:42:51.031
ENVIRONMENT INTO A HOME OR

01:42:51.098 --> 01:42:53.100
ASSISTED LIVING- WITH WHETHER

01:42:53.166 --> 01:42:54.535
IT'S YOU KNOW HOW MODIFICATIONS

01:42:54.601 --> 01:42:58.772
OR- MEDICALLY TAILORED MEALS-

01:42:58.839 --> 01:43:00.207
IT'S A LOT. A LOT LESS BECAUSE-

01:43:00.274 --> 01:43:02.142
I WOULD BE COVERED OUR AND CUT

01:43:02.209 --> 01:43:04.411
SOMEONE OUT OF ME IS. NOT YEAH

01:43:04.478 --> 01:43:05.412
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT CARVING

01:43:05.479 --> 01:43:06.580
THEM OUT I'M TALK ABOUT THE

01:43:06.647 --> 01:43:08.849
POPULATION SO WHAT HAPPENS IS

01:43:08.916 --> 01:43:10.384
THAT YOUR- YOU HAVE A

01:43:10.450 --> 01:43:12.452
POPULATION OF PEOPLE WHO WHO

01:43:12.519 --> 01:43:13.287
EITHER NEED LONG TERM CARE

01:43:13.353 --> 01:43:15.188
SERVICES ARE. THAT THEY WOULD

01:43:15.255 --> 01:43:16.557
HAVE A SEPARATE CAPITATION RATE

01:43:16.623 --> 01:43:19.526
THAN LETTING A CHILD WHO'S ON.

01:43:19.593 --> 01:43:20.727
SOME POSSIBILITY BUT MUCH LESS

01:43:20.794 --> 01:43:22.696
LIKELY TO NEED THOSE SERVICES

01:43:22.763 --> 01:43:24.331
RIGHT SO WHAT HAPPENS IS WE

01:43:24.398 --> 01:43:25.098
NEED TO RECOGNIZE WE HAVE

01:43:25.165 --> 01:43:26.733
DIFFERENT RISK STRATIFICATION

01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:27.568
WITHIN THE POPULAR MEDICARE

01:43:27.634 --> 01:43:30.871
POPULATION. RIGHT SO WHAT SO

01:43:30.938 --> 01:43:32.072
YOU HAVE A POPULATION OF PEOPLE

01:43:32.139 --> 01:43:33.440
WHO ARE AT HIGHER RISK FOR THE

01:43:33.507 --> 01:43:35.142
LONG TERM CARE SERVICES AND YOU

01:43:35.208 --> 01:43:35.943
DO WANT HIM TO SAY HEY LOOK YOU

01:43:36.009 --> 01:43:37.210
KNOW WHAT INSTEAD OF. PUTTING

01:43:37.277 --> 01:43:38.512
HER IN A NURSING HOME WE CAN DO

01:43:38.579 --> 01:43:40.447
MEDICAL MEALS OR DO ALL

01:43:40.514 --> 01:43:41.682
MODIFICATION AND THAT MAKES

01:43:41.748 --> 01:43:43.584
SENSE. THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF

01:43:43.650 --> 01:43:45.385
YOU TAKE IF WE GROUP OF PEOPLE

01:43:45.452 --> 01:43:46.887
WHO ARE AT HIGH MUCH HIGHER

01:43:46.954 --> 01:43:48.155
RISK FOR FAIRLY EXPENSIVE

01:43:48.221 --> 01:43:50.324
SERVICES AND WE MIX THEM IN

01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:51.959
WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHO DON'T.

01:43:52.025 --> 01:43:53.293
THEN SOMETIMES YOU CAN GET SOME

01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:54.528
SOME NOTES ESSENTIALLY SOME

01:43:54.595 --> 01:43:56.530
SORT OF RISK BASED PAYMENT.

01:43:56.597 --> 01:43:58.465
RELATED TO THAN THAT OF

01:43:58.532 --> 01:44:00.400
POTENTIAL RISK OF NEED FOR LONG

01:44:00.467 --> 01:44:01.535
TERM CARE SO WE DON'T.

01:44:01.602 --> 01:44:04.171
BASICALLY HAVE A PLAN THAT GOES

01:44:04.237 --> 01:44:05.472
AND SITS BACK AND SAYS WELL YOU

01:44:05.539 --> 01:44:06.607
KNOW THIS IS WHAT'S DRIVING OUR

01:44:06.673 --> 01:44:09.142
EXPENSES AND SO WE'RE GOING TO

01:44:09.209 --> 01:44:11.011
FOCUS ON THAT AND THEN WE- WILL

01:44:11.078 --> 01:44:13.080
SUBSIDIZE IT WITH BECAUSE-

01:44:13.146 --> 01:44:15.449
WITH. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TOUGH

01:44:15.515 --> 01:44:16.917
LESSON ITSELF I JUST WANNA BE

01:44:16.984 --> 01:44:17.718
SURE IT AND TALK ABOUT

01:44:17.784 --> 01:44:21.254
POPULATION STRATIFICATION. OF

01:44:21.321 --> 01:44:22.022
TALK ABOUT CARVING OUT. YEAH NO

01:44:22.089 --> 01:44:23.690
I AM. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND WE

01:44:23.757 --> 01:44:25.959
DO HAVE A SEPARATE- CATEGORY OF

01:44:26.026 --> 01:44:27.728
AID FOR THE LONG TERM CARE. I'M

01:44:27.794 --> 01:44:29.262
GOING TO ASK LINDA IF YOU WOULD

01:44:29.329 --> 01:44:30.364

FOR THE LONG TERM CARE THAT.

01:44:36.937 --> 01:44:38.872
THAT MAY GIVE HIM SOME

01:44:38.939 --> 01:44:39.439
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE'RE

01:44:39.506 --> 01:44:42.743

ORDER SEPARATE ADULT RATE THAT

01:44:53.887 --> 01:44:54.821

DETAILS RIGHT HERE IN THE- THE-

01:45:33.727 --> 01:45:37.130
I WOULD. THE OTHER QUESTION-

01:45:37.197 --> 01:45:38.031
HERE THE UNDER PART OF THE

01:45:38.098 --> 01:45:39.066
PROPOSED IS. THAT YOU WILL

THEN ALSO IT STATE THAT DTS AND

01:45:50.911 --> 01:45:52.779
OVER LONGER CONDUCT INDEPENDENT

01:45:52.846 --> 01:45:54.014
OVERSIGHT OF THOSE

01:45:54.081 --> 01:45:57.784
REQUIREMENTS- SO I GUESS WHAT

ABOUT THE OVERSIGHT PROCESS FOR

01:46:14.267 --> 01:46:16.203
THE PLANS- ESPECIALLY AS WE'RE

01:46:16.269 --> 01:46:16.603
GIVING THEM MORE

01:46:16.670 --> 01:46:19.573
RESPONSIBILITIES. AND SO IF

CREATED BY NCQA WHAT HAPPENS.

01:46:24.878 --> 01:46:26.713
THE PLAN FALLS SHORT DO WE

01:46:26.780 --> 01:46:30.083
LEAVE THE PENALTY TO NCQA ARE-

01:46:30.150 --> 01:46:32.219
LIKE SO. I MEAN I GUESS OF THE

01:46:32.285 --> 01:46:33.987
LOST ACCREDITATION I GUESS YOU

01:46:34.054 --> 01:46:35.021
COULD JUST NOT USE THAT PLAN

01:46:35.088 --> 01:46:37.190
ALTHOUGH. I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT

01:46:37.257 --> 01:46:38.492
WORKS IF IT'S A CLOSE OR IT'S

01:46:38.558 --> 01:46:40.694
A- YOU KNOW. IT'S ONE OF THE

01:46:40.761 --> 01:46:42.429
TWO PLANS DO YOU JUST SIMPLY ON

01:46:42.496 --> 01:46:43.697
THEY'LL FIND A SECOND PLANTS-

01:46:43.764 --> 01:46:45.799
CAN YOU JUST TALK ABOUT. HOW

01:46:45.866 --> 01:46:48.235
THIS IN C. Q. A ACCREDITATION

01:46:48.301 --> 01:46:50.203
IS GOING TO WORK PARTICULARLY

01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:51.938
WHEN IT COMES TO IT'S EITHER A

01:46:52.005 --> 01:46:55.175
FILTRATION OR- THE DON'T MEET

01:46:55.242 --> 01:46:56.076
AND THEY MAY NOT NECESSARILY

01:46:56.143 --> 01:46:57.511
LOS REFRIGERATION BUT THEY

01:46:57.577 --> 01:46:59.546
HAVE. THEY HAVE SOME FAILURES

01:46:59.613 --> 01:47:00.647
IN MEETING THAT DO WE JUST

01:47:00.714 --> 01:47:02.816
LEAVE IT AND SEE Q. A. R. DO WE

01:47:02.883 --> 01:47:04.885
ACTUALLY HAVE SOME CONSEQUENCES

01:47:04.951 --> 01:47:06.186
FOR PLANS THAT DO NOT MEET THE

01:47:06.253 --> 01:47:09.256
NCQA. REQUIREMENTS BUT NOT TO

01:47:09.322 --> 01:47:13.560
THE GREEK OR NCQA. ITSELF MAY

01:47:13.627 --> 01:47:16.163
REMOVE THEIR ACCREDITATION. SO

01:47:16.229 --> 01:47:18.799
WE ARE WE ARE PROPOSED TO HAVE

01:47:18.865 --> 01:47:20.467
THE ACCREDITATION BY TWENTY

01:47:20.534 --> 01:47:21.935
TWENTY SIX THE REASON WHY. I WE

01:47:22.002 --> 01:47:23.170
NEEDED THAT LONG AS WE DID WORK

01:47:23.236 --> 01:47:25.238
WITH THE NCQA AND PLANS HAVE

01:47:25.305 --> 01:47:26.706
ALREADY BECOME ACCREDITED IN

01:47:26.773 --> 01:47:27.941
REGARD TO THE TIMELINE THAT IT

01:47:28.008 --> 01:47:29.876
TAKES A FROM REQUIRE ME TAKES

01:47:29.943 --> 01:47:31.244
ABOUT THREE YEARS TO GET FULL

01:47:31.311 --> 01:47:32.712
ACCREDITATION AND SO. THAT'S

01:47:32.779 --> 01:47:33.914
THE TIME PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE

01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:35.816
HAS TO BE FULLY ACCREDITED BY

01:47:35.882 --> 01:47:38.218
JUST A CLEAR BY THAT POINT- AND

01:47:38.285 --> 01:47:39.286
SO THAT'S WHY IT'S THE LATER

01:47:39.352 --> 01:47:41.454
YEARS THERE. FOR THE POINT

01:47:41.521 --> 01:47:43.523
AROUND AT WHAT WE CALL DEEMING-

01:47:43.590 --> 01:47:45.725
IN REGARDS TO USING NCQA

01:47:45.792 --> 01:47:48.261
ACCREDITATION- ONCE. ABOUT

01:47:48.328 --> 01:47:48.995
SIXTEEN I BELIEVE OF OUR

01:47:49.062 --> 01:47:50.363
MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE

01:47:50.430 --> 01:47:52.265
CURRENTLY NCQA ACCREDITED SO IT

01:47:52.332 --> 01:47:54.234
JUST BE THE GAP THERE- BUT WE

01:47:54.301 --> 01:47:56.403
CURRENTLY DON'T DO ANY DEEMING.

01:47:56.469 --> 01:47:58.038
TODAY OTHER THAN CREDENTIALING

01:47:58.104 --> 01:48:00.974
WHERE WE DO WOULD DEEM TO- NCQA

01:48:01.041 --> 01:48:02.108
FOR CREDENTIALING IN CALIFORNIA

01:48:02.175 --> 01:48:04.144
TODAY- WE WOULD LIKE TO

01:48:04.211 --> 01:48:07.047
EXPLORE- SOME NCQA DEEMING AND

01:48:07.113 --> 01:48:08.415
BY THAT I MEAN IT WHERE WE

01:48:08.481 --> 01:48:10.350
WOULD HAVE AND C. Q. A. B. THE

01:48:10.417 --> 01:48:12.752
MAIN SOURCE. OF THE REVIEW FOR

01:48:12.819 --> 01:48:14.754
THOSE VARIOUS ADMINISTRATIVE.

01:48:14.821 --> 01:48:16.022
FUNCTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS

01:48:16.089 --> 01:48:17.757
HOWEVER WE DO PROPOSED TO HAVE

01:48:17.824 --> 01:48:19.092
FULL TRANSPARENCY AND

01:48:19.159 --> 01:48:21.461
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AROUND

01:48:21.528 --> 01:48:23.597
WHAT THE DEPARTMENT WOULD DEEM.

01:48:23.663 --> 01:48:25.565
TO NCQA VERSUS WHAT WE WOULD

01:48:25.632 --> 01:48:27.601
CONTINUE TO DO TO OUR ON GOING

01:48:27.667 --> 01:48:29.970
ON OVERSIGHT MONITORING- SO WE

01:48:30.036 --> 01:48:31.304
DO WANT TO HAVE THE LEGISLATURE

01:48:31.371 --> 01:48:32.873
BE ABLE TO WEIGH IN ON THAT FOR

01:48:32.939 --> 01:48:34.207
EXAMPLE IN THE FUTURE. I

01:48:34.274 --> 01:48:36.176
DEPENDING ON WHAT WE RECOMMEND

01:48:36.243 --> 01:48:37.777
THERE HOWEVER IT WOULD NOT TAKE

01:48:37.844 --> 01:48:40.747
AWAY ANY OF THE STATE'S ABILITY

01:48:40.814 --> 01:48:41.681
TO STILL HOLD MANAGED CARE

01:48:41.748 --> 01:48:43.717
PLANS ACCOUNTABLE. IF FOR SOME

01:48:43.783 --> 01:48:45.685
REASON A MANAGED CARE PLAN-

01:48:45.752 --> 01:48:47.520
LOST ACCREDITATION FIRST BEFORE

01:48:47.587 --> 01:48:48.922
YOU JUST LOSE IT YOU GO INTO

01:48:48.989 --> 01:48:50.457
THEIR STAGES OF THAT. THE

01:48:50.523 --> 01:48:52.125
DEPARTMENT WOULD INTERVENE

01:48:52.192 --> 01:48:53.994
QUICKLY AND EARLY IN REGARDS TO

01:48:54.060 --> 01:49:00.333
ANY. OPPONENTS THAT ARE WITHIN

01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:02.802
THE DINNING AREA BUT WE ALSO

01:49:02.869 --> 01:49:04.337
WOULD PUT OUR MANAGED CARE

01:49:04.404 --> 01:49:05.739
PLANS IMMEDIATELY ON CORRECTIVE

01:49:05.805 --> 01:49:08.241
ACTION PLAN. A AND- UTILIZE THE

01:49:08.308 --> 01:49:11.278
SANCTIONS IF NECESSARY- IF

01:49:11.344 --> 01:49:13.046
SOMEONE WERE TO BE AND JEOPARDY

01:49:13.113 --> 01:49:15.515
OF SUCH A LOSS OF ACCREDITATION

01:49:15.582 --> 01:49:17.150
SO. A LOT WE DO WANT TO

01:49:17.217 --> 01:49:18.818
INCREASE THE STANDARDIZATION

01:49:18.885 --> 01:49:20.186
ACROSS ALL OF OUR MANAGED CARE

01:49:20.253 --> 01:49:22.122
PLANS WITH NCQA ACCREDITATION

01:49:22.188 --> 01:49:23.523
SIMILAR TO YOU KNOW COVER

01:49:23.590 --> 01:49:25.125
CALIFORNIA AND OTHERS WHO HAVE

01:49:25.191 --> 01:49:26.326
NCQA ACCREDITATION

01:49:26.393 --> 01:49:29.229
REQUIREMENTS- IT WOULD NOT. IT

01:49:29.296 --> 01:49:30.297
WOULD NOT PROHIBIT THE

01:49:30.363 --> 01:49:32.766
DEPARTMENT FROM ALL. OVERSIGHT

01:49:32.832 --> 01:49:35.135
AND REQUIREMENTS- AS WELL AS

01:49:35.201 --> 01:49:37.137
FULLTRANSPARENCY IN REGARDS TO

01:49:37.203 --> 01:49:38.905
ANY AREAS THAT WE DO GOING TO

01:49:38.972 --> 01:49:41.675
NCQA. VERSES PUTTING OUR

01:49:41.741 --> 01:49:42.909
RESOURCES THAT WERE OTHERWISE

01:49:42.976 --> 01:49:43.810
LOOKING AT CERTAIN

01:49:43.877 --> 01:49:46.012
ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS TO-

01:49:46.079 --> 01:49:47.681
YOU KNOW REALLY FOCUSING ON FOR

01:49:47.747 --> 01:49:49.783
EXAMPLE INCREASING-

01:49:49.849 --> 01:49:51.885
IMPROVEMENTS IN QUALITY. I

01:49:51.952 --> 01:49:52.719
DELIVERY SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION

01:49:52.786 --> 01:49:54.521
EQUITY OKAY. SO HOPEFULLY THAT

01:49:54.587 --> 01:49:56.189
ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION OKAY

01:49:56.256 --> 01:49:58.858
CERTAINLY AND- IT'S NOT THE

01:49:58.925 --> 01:50:01.928
ISSUE WHEN YOU SAID- THAT- IT

01:50:01.995 --> 01:50:03.964
DOESN'T PROHIBIT THE- AGENCY

01:50:04.030 --> 01:50:05.966
FROM ACTING I JUST WANNA BE

01:50:06.032 --> 01:50:09.202
SURE THAT- THAT THE AGENCY AND

01:50:09.269 --> 01:50:11.304
DEEMING AND DIMMING IS FINALLY

01:50:11.371 --> 01:50:11.871
HAVE A- YOU KNOW AN

01:50:11.938 --> 01:50:13.006
ORGANIZATION LIKE AND SECURE

01:50:13.073 --> 01:50:18.545
WAY- THE- BUT- THAT- THAT. THE

01:50:18.611 --> 01:50:20.480
POLICY DOESN'T BECOME A- WELL

01:50:20.547 --> 01:50:22.215
SINCE WE'VE DECIDED TO DEEM

01:50:22.282 --> 01:50:24.050
THAT WE'RE WE'RE NOT GOING TO

01:50:24.117 --> 01:50:25.986
DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT RIGHT SO

01:50:26.052 --> 01:50:27.320
THAT YES THERE'S NOTHING THAT'S

01:50:27.387 --> 01:50:28.388
IN THE PROPOSAL THAT WOULD

01:50:28.455 --> 01:50:30.290
PROHIBIT. THE SYSTEM ACTING AS

01:50:30.357 --> 01:50:32.792
WANNA DCS WHACKED. OUT AND NOT

01:50:32.859 --> 01:50:34.194
JUST SIMPLY SAY WELL WE'VE WE

01:50:34.260 --> 01:50:35.562
IS NOW THE SITE THE DMZ AND

01:50:35.628 --> 01:50:36.830
SECURITY SO WE'RE NOT

01:50:36.896 --> 01:50:39.265
RESPONSIBLE ANYMORE- SO I JUST

01:50:39.332 --> 01:50:40.233
WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT

01:50:40.300 --> 01:50:40.867
THAT DOESN'T BECOME PART OF THE

01:50:40.934 --> 01:50:44.437
CULTURE- THAT- IN TERMS OF THE-

01:50:44.504 --> 01:50:46.673
THE- THE MESSAGE WE'RE SENDING-

01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:48.341
AND I APPRECIATE THAT THEIR

01:50:48.408 --> 01:50:49.776
VIEWS- YOU. KNOW PUBLIC TO

01:50:49.843 --> 01:50:56.383
TRANSPARENCY. AROUND THE TEAM

01:50:56.449 --> 01:50:58.485
PROCESS. READ MANAGED RATES- US

01:50:58.551 --> 01:50:59.619
UNDERSTAND- PART OF FOR YOU'RE

01:50:59.686 --> 01:51:01.721
TRYING TO THAT HE DESCRIBED- WE

01:51:01.788 --> 01:51:02.355
I MEAN I UNDERSTAND WE DO KNOW

01:51:02.422 --> 01:51:03.289
WHAT TO BE. ARE ARE YOU GOING

01:51:03.356 --> 01:51:04.157
TO USE TO COVER CALIFORNIA

01:51:04.224 --> 01:51:05.358
REGIONS WHAT KIND OF REGION'S

01:51:05.425 --> 01:51:08.094
ARE YOU USING. TO SELL US

01:51:08.161 --> 01:51:10.096
REGIONAL MANAGED CARE RATE

01:51:10.163 --> 01:51:13.166
SETTING- I'M GONNA LET ALLEN

01:51:13.233 --> 01:51:14.000
THE HEARING AN ANSWER THAT

01:51:14.067 --> 01:51:19.005
QUESTION. GIVE. YES WE ARE WE

01:51:19.072 --> 01:51:20.907
ARE STILL WORKING THROUGH WHAT

01:51:20.974 --> 01:51:22.976
THOSE REGIONS WILL LOOK LIKE-

01:51:23.043 --> 01:51:25.145
AND WHAT WE WILL MATCH THAT UP

01:51:25.211 --> 01:51:26.312
WITH WE'VE BEEN DOING SOME

01:51:26.379 --> 01:51:27.714
RESEARCH TO TRY TO DETERMINE

01:51:27.781 --> 01:51:29.783
BASED ON THAT THE MACRO

01:51:29.849 --> 01:51:32.218
INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE TODAY

01:51:32.285 --> 01:51:34.120
I'M SURE THAT. THERE'S REGION

01:51:34.187 --> 01:51:36.823
POPULAR COST PROFILE SIMILAR

01:51:36.890 --> 01:51:39.159
EXPERIENCE I'M INTO WORKING IN

01:51:39.225 --> 01:51:39.993
YOUR WORK AND WE WILL ALSO

01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:41.995
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR

01:51:42.062 --> 01:51:43.430
MANAGED CARE PLAN PARTNERS

01:51:43.496 --> 01:51:45.532
ACTUALLY ESTABLISH THOSE YOU

01:51:45.598 --> 01:51:47.567
ENSURE THAT THAT THERE ARE- YOU

01:51:47.634 --> 01:51:48.768
KNOW MY NAY AND ARE

01:51:48.835 --> 01:51:50.270
APPROPRIATIONS YEAH SO

01:51:50.336 --> 01:51:51.171
CERTAINLY THAT'S GONNA BE

01:51:51.237 --> 01:51:53.306
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR EXAMPLE IN

01:51:53.373 --> 01:51:56.276
THE MEDICARE PROGRAM- THERE'RE.

01:51:56.342 --> 01:51:57.510
SAMPLE SACRAMENTO SINCE OUR

01:51:57.577 --> 01:52:02.382
REGIONAL AREA. AS A AS A RULE

01:52:02.449 --> 01:52:03.583
AREA. WE'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT RAY

01:52:03.650 --> 01:52:05.118
ROLE AND SO ARE STRUCTURE IN

01:52:05.185 --> 01:52:07.087
PAIN AT MEDICARE ARE. BECAUSE

01:52:07.153 --> 01:52:08.888
OF AND SO. AND PART OF IT

01:52:08.955 --> 01:52:10.390
BECAUSE YOU GUYS. BACK KNOW

01:52:10.457 --> 01:52:13.293
DECADES AGO SO AND SO WE COME

01:52:13.359 --> 01:52:14.561
TO READ MANAGER CARE RATES I

01:52:14.627 --> 01:52:16.129
THINK PART OF IT CERTAINLY WANT

01:52:16.196 --> 01:52:17.097
TO KNOW WHAT THOSE REGIONS ARE

01:52:17.163 --> 01:52:20.166
GOING TO BE- SO WHY KNOW HOW

01:52:20.233 --> 01:52:21.668
THOSE REASONS MIGHT OF ALL OVER

01:52:21.734 --> 01:52:23.803
TIME- REFLECTING POTENTIALLY

01:52:23.870 --> 01:52:25.472
POPULATION SHIFTS AND OTHER

01:52:25.538 --> 01:52:26.806
THINGS THAT. WILL COURSE CAPITA

01:52:26.873 --> 01:52:28.908
PER TIME DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFTS AND

01:52:28.975 --> 01:52:31.878
SO FORTH. SO THINK WE NEED A

01:52:31.945 --> 01:52:34.647
MUCH MORE DETAIL ON THAT- AND

01:52:34.714 --> 01:52:36.616
THEN- NOW WE TALKED ABOUT THE

01:52:36.683 --> 01:52:39.786
ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT- SO

01:52:39.853 --> 01:52:41.421
AND YOU TALK ABOUT THE PERCENT

01:52:41.488 --> 01:52:42.322
THE YOU HAVE A DESCRIPTION OF

01:52:42.388 --> 01:52:44.023
THE- TARGET POPULATIONS COULD

01:52:44.090 --> 01:52:45.158
SO HE JUST SPEAK TO WHAT

01:52:45.225 --> 01:52:47.527
PERCENTAGE OF OUR THIRTEEN.

01:52:47.594 --> 01:52:49.195
MILLION POINT WHATEVER MILLION

01:52:49.262 --> 01:52:50.663
PEOPLE WHO ARE ON MEDICARE

01:52:50.730 --> 01:52:51.698
MANAGED CARE PLANS WOULD

01:52:51.764 --> 01:52:55.602
ACTUALLY. QUALIFY FOR ENHANCED

01:52:55.668 --> 01:52:56.202
YOUR MANAGEMENT. HOW MANY OF

01:52:56.269 --> 01:52:58.505
THEM. SO WE DON'T HAVE AN EXACT

01:52:58.571 --> 01:53:00.807
PERCENT OF WHAT WE DO KNOW IS

01:53:00.874 --> 01:53:04.010
THAT. ABOUT A ROUGH PERCENT I

01:53:04.077 --> 01:53:06.012
GOT NO EXIT OKAY SO WHAT. WE'RE

01:53:06.079 --> 01:53:08.114
TALKING TEN TWENTY THIRTY IT'S

01:53:08.181 --> 01:53:11.251
CLOSE 210% NO IT SHOULD BE THE

01:53:11.317 --> 01:53:13.753
ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT IS FOR

01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:16.523
YOUR TOP HIGHEST- WHETHER IT'S

01:53:16.589 --> 01:53:17.824
UTILIZED THERE'S OR MOST

01:53:17.891 --> 01:53:19.359
COMPLEX INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE

01:53:19.425 --> 01:53:21.628
FACING KIND OF ON BOTH THE

01:53:21.694 --> 01:53:24.230
MEDICAL AND SOCIAL- DRIVERS A

01:53:24.297 --> 01:53:25.565
OF HEALTH SO IT'S NOT

01:53:25.632 --> 01:53:28.668
NECESSARILY- IT'S EASY TO PUT.

01:53:28.735 --> 01:53:30.403
UP PERCENT ON WHICH IS WHY WE

01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:32.205
TYPICALLY DON'T GIVE UP PERCENT

01:53:32.272 --> 01:53:33.873
OKAY THAT IT'S GOING TO VERY

01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:35.375
BASED ON THE DIFFERENT TARGET

01:53:35.441 --> 01:53:38.111
POPULATIONS- AND ONE THING I

01:53:38.178 --> 01:53:40.146
WOULD JUST MENTION IS. JUST THE

01:53:40.213 --> 01:53:41.948
THOSE THAT MAY BE ELIGIBLE THE

01:53:42.015 --> 01:53:44.050
NUMBER THAT ENGAGE IS A VERY

01:53:44.117 --> 01:53:45.585
DIFFERENT NUMBERS BECAUSE OF

01:53:45.652 --> 01:53:46.853
THE COMPLEXITIES AND SO THAT'S

01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:50.557
WHY. IT'S HARD FOR THE

01:53:50.623 --> 01:53:52.325
DEPARTMENT BUT- WELL IT OKAY I

01:53:52.392 --> 01:53:53.927
YOU CAN GIVE THESE. NUMBER BUT

01:53:53.993 --> 01:53:55.929
I THINK SCALE IS IMPORTANT

01:53:55.995 --> 01:53:57.997
RIGHT SO AND FOR EXAMPLE YOU

01:53:58.064 --> 01:53:58.865
KNOW WHEN THE TARGET

01:53:58.932 --> 01:54:01.167
POPULATIONS ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:54:01.234 --> 01:54:01.734
AT RISK OF BEING HOMELESS OR

01:54:01.801 --> 01:54:05.638
HOMELESS. RIGHT AND BY THE WAY

01:54:05.705 --> 01:54:09.309
THEY'RE HARD TO REACH SO. WHEN

01:54:09.375 --> 01:54:10.777
WE'RE DOING CONTRACTS MANAGED

01:54:10.843 --> 01:54:14.013
CARE PLANS- WHAT WE DON'T WANT

01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:15.848
TO DO IS HAVE THEM CONTRACT

01:54:15.915 --> 01:54:17.183
RIGHT FOR THE POPULATION AND

01:54:17.250 --> 01:54:19.752
THEN NOT DO SUFFICIENT OUTREACH

01:54:19.819 --> 01:54:22.222
AND THEN BASICALLY OKAY SO YOU

01:54:22.288 --> 01:54:25.091
KNOW WE GOT A SO I THINK HAVING

01:54:25.158 --> 01:54:26.759
A NUMBER OF HAVING AT LEAST AND

01:54:26.826 --> 01:54:29.162
RANGE IS IMPORTANT SO AND SO

01:54:29.229 --> 01:54:30.430
I'M JUST THINKING SKILLS SO WE

01:54:30.496 --> 01:54:32.065
TALK ABOUT THE TOP ONE PERCENT.

01:54:32.131 --> 01:54:37.303
THE TOP 3% THE TOP 5% TOP 10%

01:54:37.370 --> 01:54:38.404
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

01:54:38.471 --> 01:54:39.505
SAYING WE'RE ONLY GOING TO DO

01:54:39.572 --> 01:54:42.742
THE TOP 2% HARD TO TOP 10% OF

01:54:42.809 --> 01:54:46.346
THE TOP 20% RIGHT SO- FOR YOU

01:54:46.412 --> 01:54:47.880
KNOW THAT AT LEAST IN TRYING TO

01:54:47.947 --> 01:54:49.716
FIGURE OUT HOW YOU KNOW WHAT

01:54:49.782 --> 01:54:50.450
WHAT EXACTLY WE'RE TRYING TO

01:54:50.516 --> 01:54:52.118
BUDGET FOR. I MEAN WE HAVE

01:54:52.185 --> 01:54:53.553
SEVEN DIFFERENT NOT A CATEGORY

01:54:53.620 --> 01:54:55.154

LIEU SERVICES STATE CHOOSE.

02:01:45.898 --> 02:01:47.566

ZERO GMC COUNTIES- THE RURAL

02:01:50.770 --> 02:01:51.937

02:01:52.004 --> 02:01:53.406
IT USUALLY WATER TO LEAST

02:01:53.472 --> 02:01:56.676
COUPLE PLANNED SO AND COUNTIES

YOU'LL BE ENCOURAGING PLANS TO

02:02:24.637 --> 02:02:25.905

COUNTIES- THE END THAT WILL BE

02:02:38.584 --> 02:02:39.452
ROLLED OUT THROUGH THE

02:02:39.518 --> 02:02:42.188
PROCUREMENT PROCESS- AND SO.

02:02:42.254 --> 02:02:43.055
WE'RE GONNA DO EVERYTHING WE

02:02:45.925 --> 02:02:48.894
HERSCHEL AND LOCAL INITIATIVES-

02:02:48.961 --> 02:02:50.963

THOSE IN LIEU OF SERVICES- AND

02:03:03.609 --> 02:03:04.410
SO BROKERING THOSE

02:03:04.477 --> 02:03:05.845
CONVERSATIONS OF PROVIDERS

02:03:05.911 --> 02:03:08.013
ACROSS BOTH OF THE PLANS ARE TO

02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:09.515
INVEST IN THOSE SERVICES WILL

02:03:09.582 --> 02:03:10.516
BE WORKED AT THE DEPARTMENT

02:03:10.583 --> 02:03:12.785
WILL HAVE TO ENGAGE IN. OKAY HI

02:03:12.852 --> 02:03:14.120
I APPRECIATE THAT THE BIGGEST

02:03:14.186 --> 02:03:15.988
BARRIER IS THE IS THE PROVIDERS

02:03:16.055 --> 02:03:16.956
BUT I I'M I'M ALSO JUST

02:03:17.022 --> 02:03:18.424
CONCERNED THAT COUNTIES WITH

02:03:18.491 --> 02:03:20.593
MULTIPLE PLANS. IF THERE IF

02:03:20.659 --> 02:03:21.761
PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT SETS OF THE

02:03:21.827 --> 02:03:24.196
NEW SERVICES- THEN YOU'RE GOING

02:03:24.263 --> 02:03:25.164
TO HAVE ITSO I DON'T KNOW IF

02:03:25.231 --> 02:03:25.931
THAT'S GOING TO FACTOR

02:03:25.998 --> 02:03:27.199
CAPITATION RATES OR SOMETHING

02:03:27.266 --> 02:03:28.901
BECAUSE UPS BUT YOU MAY TRACK

DIFFERENT TYPES OF POPULATIONS-

02:03:31.337 --> 02:03:32.705
AND THEN THE OTHER ISSUE IS

02:03:32.772 --> 02:03:33.739
THAT YOU KNOW THE MEDICARE

02:03:33.806 --> 02:03:37.143
POPULATION. SOMETIMES PEOPLE

02:03:37.209 --> 02:03:38.677
DON'T ALWAYS. THE SIDE WHICH

PLAN LETTER TECHNIQUE THE

02:03:39.712 --> 02:03:41.213
SENATE PLAN BUT OFTEN. THEY MAY

02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:42.481
NOT MAKE A DECISION TO GET

02:03:42.548 --> 02:03:43.716
PLACE PLACE IN THE PLAN AND

02:03:43.783 --> 02:03:44.950
THEN THAT THAT YOU MAY FIND

02:03:45.017 --> 02:03:46.619
PEOPLE. AND WELL YOU HAVE A

02:03:46.685 --> 02:03:47.586
COMBINATION OF EITHER PEOPLE

02:03:47.653 --> 02:03:50.289
OR- FIND THEMSELVES. THEY'LL

02:03:50.356 --> 02:03:51.190
AUTOMATICALLY PLACED IN THE

02:03:51.257 --> 02:03:53.692
WRONG PLAN OR YOU COULD ALSO

02:03:53.759 --> 02:03:55.961
HAVE- DISTORTIONS IN TERMS OF

02:03:56.028 --> 02:03:57.563
WHAT POPULATIONS AND WHAT WE

02:03:57.630 --> 02:03:58.597

02:04:03.469 --> 02:04:04.270
WANT TO ATTRACT ALL THE

02:04:04.336 --> 02:04:05.604
HOMELESS PEOPLE RIGHT SO WILL

02:04:05.671 --> 02:04:07.540
VOID THOSE SERVICES. AND

02:04:07.606 --> 02:04:08.407
HOPEFULLY THE OTHER PLAN WILL

02:04:08.474 --> 02:04:10.176
DO IT AND NO NO PLAN WILL DO

02:04:10.242 --> 02:04:12.244
THOSE BECAUSE THEY NEED A ONE

02:04:12.311 --> 02:04:13.245
WHAT'S THAT POPULATION IS IT'S

02:04:13.312 --> 02:04:14.680
MUCH HARDER. AND SO I DON'T

02:04:14.747 --> 02:04:15.781
KNOW IT BUT FOR EXAMPLE. I

02:04:15.848 --> 02:04:17.783
KNOW. AGAIN I UNDERSTAND YOU

02:04:17.850 --> 02:04:19.018
SAID FEDERAL REGULATION

02:04:19.084 --> 02:04:21.320

THEIR PAYMENT RATES FOR PLANS

02:04:28.794 --> 02:04:29.829
TO CHOOSE THE DECIDE

02:04:29.895 --> 02:04:31.230
DIFFERENTLY SERVICES WE GATHER

02:04:31.297 --> 02:04:34.033
MORE DATA ON HOW POPULATIONS.

02:04:34.099 --> 02:04:36.435

CERTAIN AND LOSE SERVICES THAT

02:04:37.703 --> 02:04:42.241
MIGHT ACTUALLY. CAUSE

02:04:42.308 --> 02:04:42.875
DIFFERENCES IN CASE MIX. YES WE

02:04:42.942 --> 02:04:45.277
WOULD- THEY- PROVIDE THE IN

02:04:45.344 --> 02:04:45.945
LIEU OF SERVICES THAT WOULD BE

02:04:46.011 --> 02:04:47.313
BUILT INTO THEIR RATE SO IF

02:04:47.379 --> 02:04:49.381
THEY- ARE PROVIDING THEM AT A

02:04:49.448 --> 02:04:51.317
HIGHER RATE OR- I'M MORE IN

02:04:51.383 --> 02:04:52.418
LIEU OF SERVICES THAT IS. THAT

02:04:52.484 --> 02:04:53.586
EVENTUALLY GETS BUILT INTO THE

RATE IN OUTSCORED IN THE BUDGET

02:04:55.054 --> 02:04:56.922
RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE OF THE IN

02:04:56.989 --> 02:04:57.890
LIEU OF SERVICES PROVIDED

02:04:57.957 --> 02:05:00.059
THROUGH WHOLE PERSON CARE. AND

02:05:00.125 --> 02:05:02.361
HELP HOMES AS THOSE TRANSITION

02:05:02.428 --> 02:05:04.163
IN THOSE COUNTIES WE ACCOUNT

02:05:04.230 --> 02:05:06.765
FOR THOSE PLANS THAT. ELECT TO

02:05:06.832 --> 02:05:07.933
GET THOSE IN THOSE SERVICES TO

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:09.702
RECEIVE THOSE FUNDS THROUGH

02:05:09.768 --> 02:05:10.302
THROUGH THE BUDGET AS WELL SO

02:05:10.369 --> 02:05:12.204
THEY WOULD BE FUNDED. WHICH

02:05:12.271 --> 02:05:14.106
WOULD BE THERE. YOU KNOW WHICH

02:05:14.173 --> 02:05:15.374
IS IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO HAVE

02:05:15.441 --> 02:05:16.675
THAT FUNDING ALL RIGHT NOW SO

02:05:16.742 --> 02:05:18.010
THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE DROP OFF

02:05:18.077 --> 02:05:19.345
OF THOSE IN THE WEB SERVICES IN

02:05:19.411 --> 02:05:20.312
THE COULD MAINTAIN THOSE

02:05:20.379 --> 02:05:22.514
SERVICES WITHIN THE COUNTY- SO

02:05:22.581 --> 02:05:24.984
THAT KELLY PROPOSAL COUNTER

ABOUT. OKAY AND- JUST. DO I

02:05:27.753 --> 02:05:30.623
POINT OUT THAT THE- IN TERMS OF

THE EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY- THE

02:05:34.059 --> 02:05:35.661
AMOUNT FOR IN LIEU SERVICES

02:05:35.728 --> 02:05:37.229

REQUEST. WAS HERE SAID FORTY

02:05:40.466 --> 02:05:42.635
ESSENTIALLY FORTY EIGHT MILLION-

02:05:42.701 --> 02:05:45.704
IS THAT REFLECT WHAT WAS THAT

02:05:45.771 --> 02:05:50.376
REFLECT- SO THAT IS- SIX MONTHS

02:05:50.442 --> 02:05:51.744
WORTH OF IN LIEU OF SERVICES

02:05:51.810 --> 02:05:52.945
BECAUSE WE'RE ONLY SCORING SIX

02:05:53.012 --> 02:05:54.446
MONTHS- AND THERE'S A CASH

02:05:54.513 --> 02:05:57.216
FLAG- BUT- I BELIEVE IT GETS

02:05:57.283 --> 02:05:59.318
CLOSE TO THE COURSE I DON'T

02:05:59.385 --> 02:06:00.352

02:06:07.092 --> 02:06:09.061
OFF OF OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE

02:06:09.128 --> 02:06:10.429
SERVICES BEING PROVIDED THROUGH

02:06:10.496 --> 02:06:11.997
HEALTH COMES IN HOT PERSON CARE

02:06:12.064 --> 02:06:13.132
TODAY BASED ON UTILIZATION

02:06:13.198 --> 02:06:16.535
TODAY OKAY AND THEN FINALLY-

02:06:16.602 --> 02:06:19.104
AND- I JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON I

02:06:19.171 --> 02:06:23.242
KNOW THAT UNDER STAFFING

02:06:23.309 --> 02:06:24.376
RESOURCES REQUEST- I SHOULD

02:06:24.443 --> 02:06:26.145
NOTE THAT THE MEDICAID MANAGED

02:06:26.211 --> 02:06:27.513
INFORMATION SYSTEM DIVISION

02:06:27.579 --> 02:06:29.915
ONLY. HAD ONE ADDITIONAL

02:06:29.982 --> 02:06:30.983
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

02:06:31.050 --> 02:06:32.584
SPECIALIST- I GUESS AND I KNOW

02:06:32.651 --> 02:06:33.419
WE'RE GONNA DELVE A LITTLE MORE

02:06:33.485 --> 02:06:35.087
INTO THE I. T. STUFF AND

02:06:35.154 --> 02:06:37.356
THERE'S OTHER VCTS FOR I. T.

02:06:37.423 --> 02:06:40.326
BUT I DON'T IT IN TERMS OF

02:06:40.392 --> 02:06:42.628
CALAMP WHAT HE JUST MUST BE

02:06:42.695 --> 02:06:44.997
GENERALLY IN TERMS OF I. T. L.

02:06:45.064 --> 02:06:46.298
I THINK OVERSIGHT AND DATA

02:06:46.365 --> 02:06:47.166
COLLECTION CAN BE REALLY

02:06:47.232 --> 02:06:48.067
IMPORTANT RIGHT WE'RE DOING

02:06:48.133 --> 02:06:49.335
THIS HUGE TRANSFORMATION WE

02:06:49.401 --> 02:06:50.903
DIDN'T KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING

02:06:50.970 --> 02:06:53.405
HOW'S IT GOING AND SO FORTH-

02:06:53.472 --> 02:06:55.374
WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE I. T.

02:06:55.441 --> 02:06:59.211
DEMANDS- FOR- FOR. GOING TO

02:06:59.278 --> 02:07:00.546
MOVING ON TO CALAIS AND IN

02:07:00.612 --> 02:07:01.647
TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO DO THE

02:07:01.714 --> 02:07:03.515
KIND OF THIS ASSESSMENTS IN

02:07:03.582 --> 02:07:05.751
OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY

02:07:05.818 --> 02:07:07.486
AND THEN TH OTHER PART IS

02:07:07.553 --> 02:07:09.021
THAT- I KNOW YOU'RE ADDING SOME

02:07:09.088 --> 02:07:10.856
ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL MANAGER

02:07:10.923 --> 02:07:12.891
QUALITY MONITORING DIVISION-

02:07:12.958 --> 02:07:14.493
BUT AGAIN I'D SAY WITH THIS

02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:16.028
BROADER ROLE FOR MANAGED CARE

02:07:16.095 --> 02:07:17.396
AND I THINK THAT REALLY GOING

02:07:17.463 --> 02:07:19.064
TO DO ANOTHER QUESTION AT THE

02:07:19.131 --> 02:07:21.667
THAT THE NOW THE ISSUE IS THAT

02:07:21.734 --> 02:07:23.202
I DON'T THINK WE- THE CONCERN

02:07:23.268 --> 02:07:24.803
IS THAT THE GOALS I THINK THE

02:07:24.870 --> 02:07:27.039
QUESTION IS THAT. WE CAN'T WE

02:07:27.106 --> 02:07:28.374
WHAT WE DON'T WANT HIS CONTRACT

02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:29.308
OUT THE RESPONSIBILITY

02:07:29.375 --> 02:07:31.510
ACCOUNTABILITY SO THEREFORE IS

02:07:31.577 --> 02:07:33.779
THAT ENOUGH STAFF TO BE SURE

02:07:33.846 --> 02:07:35.214
THERE SUFFICIENT ACCOUNTABILITY

02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:36.315
FOR THE MANAGED CARE PLANS AND

02:07:36.382 --> 02:07:40.586
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A MANAGED.

02:07:40.652 --> 02:07:42.621
CARE PLAN DOESN'T- WELL DOESN'T

02:07:42.688 --> 02:07:43.789
DELIVER ON UNDER THINGS THAT WE

02:07:43.856 --> 02:07:46.058
COUNT ON SO- AND WHAT THE

02:07:46.125 --> 02:07:47.292
CONSEQUENCES FOR THIS HOW HOW

02:07:47.359 --> 02:07:48.627
LONG ARE THEY ON A CORRECTIVE

02:07:48.694 --> 02:07:49.995
ACTION PLAN BEFORE SOMETHING

02:07:50.062 --> 02:07:51.463
HAPPENS WHAT OPTIONS DOES. THE

02:07:51.530 --> 02:07:53.332
CS ACTUALLY HAVE GIVEN THE FACT

02:07:53.399 --> 02:07:54.666
THAT MANY COUNTIES THERE ARE

02:07:54.733 --> 02:07:57.136
MANY PLANS SO THAT MEANS NOT

02:07:57.202 --> 02:07:57.736
JUST SIMPLE AS SIMPLY TURNING

02:07:57.803 --> 02:07:59.905
OFF THE PLAN- SO CAN CAN YOU

02:07:59.972 --> 02:08:03.108

IN JUST PROVIDING- YOU KNOW

REGION GAUGE MEN AS WELL AS

02:15:29.287 --> 02:15:30.021
ACTUAL UTILIZATION OF THE

02:15:30.088 --> 02:15:32.057
SERVICES- WE ARE ALSO THINKING

02:15:32.123 --> 02:15:33.825
THROUGH WHAT METRICS YOU WILL

02:15:33.892 --> 02:15:36.027

MONITOR- THIS WORK- AND REALLY

02:15:39.164 --> 02:15:40.765
THINK ABOUT IT FROM A DELIVERY

02:15:40.832 --> 02:15:42.834
SYSTEM OF POINT OF VIEW. WE

02:15:42.901 --> 02:15:45.170
CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH OUR

02:15:45.237 --> 02:15:46.338
MANAGED CARE PLANS IN REGARDS

02:15:46.404 --> 02:15:48.106
TO YOU- ENSURING THAT CHILDREN

02:15:48.173 --> 02:15:49.808
HAVE ACCESS TO PREVENTATIVE

02:15:49.875 --> 02:15:52.043
SERVICES- AND THINKING A LITTLE

02:15:52.110 --> 02:15:53.411
DIFFERENTLY IN REGARDS TO HOW

02:15:53.478 --> 02:15:54.279
WE DO THAT WITH AND THERE'S

02:15:54.346 --> 02:15:55.614
BEEN A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES

02:15:55.680 --> 02:15:58.984
THAT WE HAVE ROLLED OUT- IN

02:15:59.050 --> 02:15:59.551
TWENTY TWENTY EVEN WITH THE

02:15:59.618 --> 02:16:00.886
PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND WE

02:16:00.952 --> 02:16:02.888
WILL CONTINUE TO. WORK CLOSELY

02:16:02.954 --> 02:16:04.456
WITH ALL OF OUR MANAGED CARE

02:16:04.523 --> 02:16:06.791
PLANS I THINK IT'S ALSO ON THE

02:16:06.858 --> 02:16:08.593
PROCUREMENT I WAS MENTIONING IS

02:16:08.660 --> 02:16:09.961
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

02:16:10.028 --> 02:16:12.030
DEPARTMENT TO ENSURE THAT WE

02:16:12.097 --> 02:16:15.567
ARE USING- EVALUATION OF WHO

02:16:15.634 --> 02:16:16.768
COMES INTO THE MARKETING

02:16:16.835 --> 02:16:18.336
CALIFORNIA TO ENSURE THAT THEY

SERVICES AND QUALITY AND THINGS

02:16:22.974 --> 02:16:25.977
pSERVICES TO CHILDREN. IT'S

02:16:26.044 --> 02:16:27.212
GOING TO BE A KEY FACTOR IN

02:16:27.279 --> 02:16:29.047
REGARDS TO OUR VALUATION OF

02:16:29.114 --> 02:16:33.718
THOSE PLANS I'M. JUST TO STAY

02:16:33.785 --> 02:16:35.120
IN CALIFORNIA IN THE FUTURE-

02:16:35.186 --> 02:16:37.055
OKAY SO THEN MY FINAL QUESTION

02:16:37.122 --> 02:16:39.357
WOULD BE GIVEN THE FACT THAT

02:16:39.424 --> 02:16:42.027
THE HEALTH CARE- SYSTEM HAS

02:16:42.093 --> 02:16:44.129
BEEN EXPERIENCING SO MANY

02:16:44.195 --> 02:16:49.467
CHANGES- WHITE IS DH CS YEAR

02:16:49.534 --> 02:16:52.070
OLD THAT- SO MANY THESE

02:16:52.137 --> 02:16:54.339
DRAMATIC CHANGES ARE NECESSARY

02:16:54.406 --> 02:16:57.309
THIS YEAR. ALSO THE DRIVING

02:16:57.375 --> 02:17:00.145
FACTOR BEHIND- THE CHANGES THIS

02:17:00.211 --> 02:17:02.447
YEAR IS THE END OF OUR ELEVEN

02:17:02.514 --> 02:17:04.149
FIFTEEN WAIVER SO- WE ACTUALLY

02:17:04.215 --> 02:17:05.517
WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE OUR

02:17:05.584 --> 02:17:06.151
ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER WHICH IS

02:17:06.217 --> 02:17:07.719
CURRENTLY WHERE MANY OF THESE

02:17:07.786 --> 02:17:11.122
PILOTS ARE- FUNDED OF WHETHER

02:17:11.189 --> 02:17:14.159
THROUGH LOCAL FUNDS OR MATCHING

02:17:14.225 --> 02:17:16.928
FEDERAL FUNDS- IT WAS SUPPOSED

02:17:16.995 --> 02:17:18.563
TO END ON DECEMBER. THIRTY

02:17:18.630 --> 02:17:20.031
FIRST TWENTY TWENTY BECAUSE OF

02:17:20.098 --> 02:17:22.367
THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY- WE

02:17:22.434 --> 02:17:24.069
QUICKLY SUBMITTED AN EXTENSION

02:17:24.135 --> 02:17:25.737
TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR A

02:17:25.804 --> 02:17:27.072
TWELVE MONTH EXTENSION WHICH IS

02:17:27.138 --> 02:17:28.740
UNPRECEDENTED JUST TO BE CLEAR

02:17:28.807 --> 02:17:30.709
IN REGARDS TO THAT REQUEST- IT

02:17:30.775 --> 02:17:33.011
WAS GRANTED- TO CALIFORNIA TO

02:17:33.078 --> 02:17:35.146
GET ONE MORE YEAR. ON WITH OUR

02:17:35.213 --> 02:17:37.315
LIVES FIFTEEN ENDING. A IT DOES

02:17:37.382 --> 02:17:38.650
HAPPEN TO TRANSITION TO OTHER

02:17:38.717 --> 02:17:40.385
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES WOULD NO

02:17:40.452 --> 02:17:41.319
LONGER HAVE THE ABILITY TO

02:17:41.386 --> 02:17:44.022

WITHIN THE ELEVEN FIFTEEN- AND

02:17:52.530 --> 02:17:55.033

OUR OFFICE ACTUALLY PUBLISHED

02:21:16.534 --> 02:21:19.070
AN ANALYSIS ON OUR WEBSITE- NOT

02:21:19.137 --> 02:21:20.138
TOO LONG AGO DISCUSSING THE

AND IN THAT ANALYSIS WE

02:21:27.545 --> 02:21:28.213
RECOMMENDED THAT THE

SUSPENSION MECHANISM MAKES

02:21:42.994 --> 02:21:44.963
THEM- WE ALSO FIND THAT THE

02:21:57.375 --> 02:21:59.244

02:32:12.389 --> 02:32:14.825
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A QUORUM

02:32:14.892 --> 02:32:16.160
IS NOT NECESSARY BECAUSE IT'S

02:32:16.227 --> 02:32:19.163
INFORMATIONAL AND AT THIS TIME.

02:32:19.230 --> 02:32:21.732
IT IS PRACTICE AND CUSTOM FOR

02:32:21.799 --> 02:32:22.666
THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE NOT

THE WHOLE MODEL I THINK THE

02:58:45.614 --> 02:58:46.582
LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO LOOK

02:58:46.649 --> 02:58:48.317
AT THAT THOSE COMPONENTS SO

02:58:48.384 --> 02:58:49.151
THAT WE CAN MORE CAREFULLY

02:58:49.218 --> 02:58:52.822
EVALUATE. AS MR METZGER SAID-

02:58:52.888 --> 02:58:53.889

WITH SOME OF OUR OTHER. SYSTEMS

02:59:04.066 --> 02:59:05.301

I WILL NOT SURE BECAUSE IT'S

02:59:12.708 --> 02:59:14.110
ALL COMBINED BECAUSE THE FED

02:59:14.176 --> 02:59:14.743
REQUIRE US TO DO IT ALL

02:59:14.810 --> 02:59:17.580

MORE CAREFULLY FINE TUNE IT.

02:59:25.721 --> 02:59:26.655
THEN TRYING TO BLOW UP THE

02:59:26.722 --> 02:59:28.724
WHOLE SYSTEM OR JUST SAYING

IS MORNING. OKAY SO HELPFUL YOU

03:03:07.009 --> 03:03:09.545
YOU CAN- BOTH THE AND THE PARKS-

03:03:09.611 --> 03:03:11.547
TECHNOLOGY FOR US THAT. OF

03:03:11.613 --> 03:03:12.781
WE'RE NOT TECHNICAL BUT MY ME

03:03:12.848 --> 03:03:13.515
JUST ASK A COUPLE. OTHER

03:03:13.582 --> 03:03:14.717
QUESTIONS RELATED THIS TO TRY

03:03:14.783 --> 03:03:15.651
SO FIRST OF ALL IN TERMS OF

03:03:15.718 --> 03:03:17.019
MODERN. I KNOW THAT PART OF ITS

03:03:17.086 --> 03:03:19.188
BY ITS OF FEDERAL BUT ARE WE

03:03:19.254 --> 03:03:20.189
DEALING WITH LEGACY SO. I MEAN

03:03:20.255 --> 03:03:21.724
WE HEARD ABOUT THE ALL THINGS

LEGACIES THAT NEED TO BE SENT.

03:03:27.096 --> 03:03:28.797
UP TO IS THAT AN ISSUE OR NOT

03:03:28.864 --> 03:03:30.699
WE'RE HAVING TO DEAL WITH-

03:03:30.766 --> 03:03:31.934
HAVING TO RE WRITE SOFTWARE AND

03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:33.202
SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY SOMEONE

03:03:33.268 --> 03:03:35.037
WHO GRADUATES FROM COLLEGE NOW

03:03:35.104 --> 03:03:36.905
COULD ACTUALLY PROGRAM OR- ARE

03:03:36.972 --> 03:03:53.122
WE. HAVING SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO

03:03:53.188 --> 03:03:58.494
THAT. IT'S A SERVICE. NICK NICK

03:03:58.560 --> 03:04:02.030
REIMBURSEMENTS KAPLAN SYSTEM

03:04:02.097 --> 03:04:03.499
WHICH DOLLARS THAN. RAYMOND

03:04:03.565 --> 03:04:07.970
STORE FORMATS KAPLAN BUT THERE

03:04:08.036 --> 03:04:10.105
YEAH. AS I SAID BEFORE

03:04:10.172 --> 03:04:11.573
PROXIMITY TO HOME SUB YOU KNOW

03:04:11.640 --> 03:04:13.242
SYSTEMS FRAZIER WEARABLE LINE

03:04:13.308 --> 03:04:16.011
OKAY WELL MANY OF THEM ARE OLD

03:04:16.078 --> 03:04:18.647
LIKE A SIX. AND SILOED IS TO

03:04:18.714 --> 03:04:22.684
ALL HAVE THEM. ACTUALLY

03:04:22.751 --> 03:04:24.853
REPLACED WITH THAT INTEGRATED

03:04:24.920 --> 03:04:28.457
SYSTEM THAT WHY- START

03:04:28.524 --> 03:04:29.825
DESCRIBING IT AS ONE SYSTEM IS

03:04:29.892 --> 03:04:31.860
IN FACT. SORT OF A FEDERAL

03:04:31.927 --> 03:04:36.098
DEVELOPMENT. USER CENTRIC WELL

03:04:36.165 --> 03:04:38.033
OKAY WHAT TOGETHER SO THAT

03:04:38.100 --> 03:04:40.035
WOULD BE HELPFUL AS IS BECAUSE

03:04:40.102 --> 03:04:41.370
I MEAN I MEAN I REALIZE YOU

03:04:41.437 --> 03:04:42.404
DESCRIBED AS A SHORT

03:04:42.471 --> 03:04:43.405
DESCRIPTION SERVE WHAT THE

03:04:43.472 --> 03:04:44.940
ROADMAP IS FOR YOUR I. T. SO

03:04:45.007 --> 03:04:46.408
THAT WE CAN IN TERMS OF OUR

03:04:46.475 --> 03:04:48.377
OVERSIGHT THAT WE KNOW GET THE

03:04:48.444 --> 03:04:49.011
BIGGER PICTURE ND THEN I GUESS

03:04:49.077 --> 03:04:50.579
THE OTHER QUESTION. THE OTHER

03:04:50.646 --> 03:04:53.048
THING IS THAT- AND- WE CAN

03:04:53.115 --> 03:04:55.284
SPEAK TO OUR CALVET IS THAT I

03:04:55.350 --> 03:04:56.318
THINK WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS

03:04:56.385 --> 03:04:57.319
MOVE AWAY LIKE ALL THE BIG BANG

03:04:57.386 --> 03:04:58.954
PROJECT RIGHT I MEAN WHAT WE

03:04:59.021 --> 03:05:00.522
DON'T WANT IS ACTUALLY YOU KNOW

03:05:00.589 --> 03:05:02.624
SOME HUGE SYSTEM THAT'S MADE

03:05:02.691 --> 03:05:03.659
FOR ONE POINT IN TIME THAT

03:05:03.725 --> 03:05:04.693
THERE'S ONLY LIKE THREE

03:05:04.760 --> 03:05:05.794
CONTRACTORS OUT THERE I THINK

03:05:05.861 --> 03:05:08.430
IT'S US. TO LLOYD AND SOMEONE

03:05:08.497 --> 03:05:09.364
IN THAT WE ACTUALLY BUILD

03:05:09.431 --> 03:05:11.200
MODULAR SYSTEMS BECAUSE IT'S

03:05:11.266 --> 03:05:12.668
NOT ABOUT BUILDING A SYSTEM FOR

03:05:12.734 --> 03:05:13.836
ONE POINT TIME IS BUILDING

03:05:13.902 --> 03:05:17.306
pTIME RIGHT BECAUSE YOU HAVE

03:05:17.372 --> 03:05:18.273
DIFFERENT COMPONENTS THAT WILL

03:05:18.340 --> 03:05:19.741
EVOLVE IT SAID- AND THAT YOU

03:05:19.808 --> 03:05:20.375
CAN ACTUALLY HAVE SMALLER

03:05:20.442 --> 03:05:22.244
CONTRACTORS TO BE ABLE TO DO

03:05:22.311 --> 03:05:24.213
MODULES OR COMPONENTS. AND

03:05:24.279 --> 03:05:25.714
IMPROVE AND UPGRADE IMPROVES

03:05:25.781 --> 03:05:27.416
THOSE IS YOU KNOW CHANGED OUT

03:05:27.483 --> 03:05:28.650
REQUIRED THINK DIFFERENT

03:05:28.717 --> 03:05:30.486
DEMANDS CHANGE AND SO FORTH BUT

03:05:30.552 --> 03:05:32.321
HAVING TO REDO THE WHOLE.

03:05:32.387 --> 03:05:36.058
INFRASTRUCTURE ITSELF SO IS SO

03:05:36.124 --> 03:05:37.326
PERHAPS COUNTY CAN SPEAK TO

03:05:37.392 --> 03:05:38.393
THAT IS THAT IS THAT THE

03:05:38.460 --> 03:05:44.199
APPROACH A PLANE TO TAKE WITH.

03:05:44.266 --> 03:05:46.468
THIS MEDICAMENTS ATION SYSTEM.

03:05:46.535 --> 03:05:48.670
AND I'M GETTING MANY SECOND

03:05:48.737 --> 03:05:50.739
LIGHT I DO THREE DECADES OUR

03:05:50.806 --> 03:05:53.575
CITIES ARE S. CD RIGHT. FOR

03:05:53.642 --> 03:05:58.914
TECHNOLOGY. YEAH SO ON. IN THIS

03:05:58.981 --> 03:06:00.048
CASE WHEN WE HAD THIS

03:06:00.115 --> 03:06:01.850
MODERNIZATION THESE ARE VERY OR

03:06:01.917 --> 03:06:04.853
LEGACY SYSTEM OKAY FIFTY AND

03:06:04.920 --> 03:06:07.923
NINETY HIM IT WAS ACTUALLY-

03:06:07.990 --> 03:06:09.591
FROM COMBINATION ABOUT NINETY

03:06:09.658 --> 03:06:12.794
PLUS THIS. SO WHEN HE STARTED

03:06:12.861 --> 03:06:14.263
BACK IN THIS MORNING QUALITY

03:06:14.329 --> 03:06:16.698
SEVERAL WAS MAINLY FOCUSED ON

03:06:16.765 --> 03:06:18.267
THAT HIT LIST SOMETHING

03:06:18.333 --> 03:06:26.208
COMPANIES OF. NINETY AND MARK

03:06:26.275 --> 03:06:28.677
THIS NOT SHE TO MORE A MEDIC

03:06:28.744 --> 03:06:31.413
AND PRICES. WHICH IS BIGGER

03:06:31.480 --> 03:06:33.348
THAN GET AT IT ALL HE THE

03:06:33.415 --> 03:06:36.385
SYSTEM WAS ON THE MANAGED CARE

03:06:36.451 --> 03:06:38.287
AT THIS POINT WE DO NOT THE

03:06:38.353 --> 03:06:40.622
FOURTEENTH FOUR OFF WHAT IS

03:06:40.689 --> 03:06:43.258
MORE. IS TO LOOK LIKE BUT JUST

03:06:43.325 --> 03:06:46.128
IT IS THE THAT. PLAN IS TO HAVE

03:06:46.194 --> 03:06:49.598
A IN WOULD MY OF THE PROJECT-

03:06:49.665 --> 03:06:51.567
BASICALLY LOOK AT THE IF THAT

03:06:51.633 --> 03:06:55.437
WITH- SYSTEMS HE- WHAT HE SAYS

03:06:55.504 --> 03:06:58.974
YEAH THE MARTIN BUST FROM MAKE

03:06:59.041 --> 03:07:01.910
SOME SYSTEMS CAN MY- AND DO IN

03:07:01.977 --> 03:07:04.980
A MODEL AT. BASED ON LIKE I

03:07:05.047 --> 03:07:16.758
BASEMENT OF MAY MODEL OKAY. BUT

03:07:16.825 --> 03:07:18.460
THAT SO THAT THE FOR OUR

03:07:18.527 --> 03:07:20.362
OVERSIGHT PURPOSES THAT WE CAN

03:07:20.429 --> 03:07:21.964
SERVE SEE WHAT'S THE ROADMAP.

03:07:22.030 --> 03:07:24.099
THAT WERE- EMBARKING ON IN

03:07:24.166 --> 03:07:25.734
TERMS OF OUR I. T. NEEDS FOR

03:07:25.801 --> 03:07:26.902
MEDICARE AND I JUST SPOKE

03:07:26.969 --> 03:07:27.903
EARLIER WE TALKED ABOUT HOW

03:07:27.970 --> 03:07:29.171
LAME THE FACT THAT WE NEED

03:07:29.237 --> 03:07:31.673
UPGRADED SYSTEM STUDENT DATA

03:07:31.740 --> 03:07:34.843
COLLECTION. AS WELL. I THINK

03:07:34.910 --> 03:07:39.715
THAT- AND MANY. SURE THAT.

03:07:39.781 --> 03:07:43.819
MISTER SO THAT IDEA HERE

03:07:43.885 --> 03:07:45.787
BECAUSE OKAY LET ME BY NOW YEAR

03:07:45.854 --> 03:07:48.991
WE CAN HAVE A ROAD MAP. WILL BE

03:07:49.057 --> 03:07:51.159
CLOSER TO HAVING A ROAD MAP. I

03:07:51.226 --> 03:07:52.594
WANT TO PROMISE THE ROADMAP

03:07:52.661 --> 03:07:56.531
THEN- THIS THIS REALLY GO LOTS

03:07:56.598 --> 03:08:03.672
SMOOTH IN TOOK. OF OKAY OF REAL.

03:08:03.739 --> 03:08:05.641
SHORTING WHERE NEEDS TO OKAY SO

03:08:05.707 --> 03:08:07.843
I GUESS I WOULD SAY BOTH YOU.

03:08:07.909 --> 03:08:10.545
THAT AND- T. AND L. A. L.

03:08:10.612 --> 03:08:12.080
PERHAPS HELPING US OVER NEXT

03:08:12.147 --> 03:08:13.448
YEAR AND CERTAINLY YOU ALSO OF

03:08:13.515 --> 03:08:15.283
WHAT TRYING TO DO HERE START.

03:08:15.350 --> 03:08:17.152
AN OVERSIGHTSTRUCTURE FOR US

03:08:17.219 --> 03:08:18.687
SO THAT WE CAN- PROBABLY

03:08:18.754 --> 03:08:22.057
MONITOR- THAT PROGRESS IN

03:08:22.124 --> 03:08:23.625
DEVELOPMENT WHAT SOUNDS LIKE

03:08:23.692 --> 03:08:24.426
IT'S GOING TO BE A FAIRLY

03:08:24.493 --> 03:08:28.230
SIZEABLE- AND- I. T. PROJECT

03:08:28.296 --> 03:08:30.832
AND TO BE SURE THAT- THIS AT.

DIRECTOR COOPER GUEST. I WE ALL

03:45:35.421 --> 03:45:37.223

TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. AND I AND

03:45:43.129 --> 03:45:44.831
I BELIEVE THIS IS UP AND IT'S

03:45:44.898 --> 03:45:47.033

ISSUE THAT IN SOME WAYS IT JUST

03:45:54.908 --> 03:45:56.542
IT JUST MAKES ONE MORE LEVEL OF

03:45:56.609 --> 03:45:59.712
CONFUSION. AND POTENTIALLY

03:45:59.779 --> 03:46:01.881
DUPLICATIVE SERVICES AND NOT A

REAL CLEAR PATH ABOUT HOW

03:46:04.317 --> 03:46:07.453
SOMEBODY GETS CARE. WHAT I

03:46:07.520 --> 03:46:08.521
WOULD SAY THERE IS THAT THE

03:46:08.588 --> 03:46:09.889
MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS

03:46:09.956 --> 03:46:11.391
HAVE A CLEAR RESPONSIBILITY TO

03:46:11.457 --> 03:46:12.992
PROVIDE THE NON SPECIALTY

03:46:13.059 --> 03:46:13.793

CHILDREN AND BY CLEARLY

03:46:15.295 --> 03:46:16.896
UNDERSTAND THAT SOME COUNTIES

03:46:16.963 --> 03:46:20.266
MAY CHOOSE TO. USE A LOCAL

03:46:20.333 --> 03:46:22.101
FUNDS TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES

03:46:22.168 --> 03:46:23.436
YOU'RE ALREADY PAYING THE

03:46:23.503 --> 03:46:25.138
MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS TO

03:46:25.204 --> 03:46:26.172
DO THIS WE HOLD THEM

03:46:26.239 --> 03:46:27.173
ACCOUNTABLE TO IT IN THE

03:46:27.240 --> 03:46:29.375
CAPITATION PAID. A RATE THAT WE

03:46:29.442 --> 03:46:31.978
PAY THEM- AND SO IT WOULD BE

03:46:32.045 --> 03:46:33.479
MORE PRUDENT FOR US SINCE WE

03:46:33.546 --> 03:46:34.747
ALREADY PAYING THE MANAGED CARE

03:46:34.814 --> 03:46:36.049
PLANS THROUGH THAT- FOR THEM TO

03:46:36.115 --> 03:46:37.984
BE ON ENSURING THAT CHILDREN

03:46:38.051 --> 03:46:39.886

03:46:39.953 --> 03:46:41.321
SERVICES I THINK WITH THIS

03:46:41.387 --> 03:46:43.289
PROPOSAL OR TRYING TO LOOK A

03:46:43.356 --> 03:46:45.024
LITTLE BIT MORE UPSTREAM- IN

03:46:45.091 --> 03:46:46.726
REGARDS TO MAKING SURE THAT OUR

03:46:46.793 --> 03:46:49.195
KIDS AR GETTING ACCESS EARLY-

03:46:49.262 --> 03:46:50.763
AND WE DO THINK THAT THERE IS

03:46:50.830 --> 03:46:52.231
AN OPPORTUNITY WITH THIS TO

03:46:52.298 --> 03:46:53.166
BETTER STRENGTHEN THE

03:46:53.232 --> 03:46:54.734
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE

03:46:54.801 --> 03:46:55.969
MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PLANS. IN

03:46:56.035 --> 03:46:57.603
COUNTY BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE A

03:46:57.670 --> 03:46:58.838
SHARED RESPONSIBILITY FOR

03:46:58.905 --> 03:47:00.373

CHILDREN AND ADULTS IN

03:47:05.311 --> 03:47:08.614
CALIFORNIA- AND SO WE REALLY WE

03:47:08.681 --> 03:47:10.016
DO THINK THAT THERE IS- I'M

03:47:10.083 --> 03:47:12.352
STILL A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR

03:47:12.418 --> 03:47:14.821
EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW TODAY- WITHIN

03:47:14.887 --> 03:47:16.789
MANY OF THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH

SERVICES PROVIDED IN SCHOOLS

03:47:17.890 --> 03:47:19.492
WHETHER TO L. A. BACH OR

SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH- IT

03:47:21.194 --> 03:47:23.396
OFTEN TIME IS ONLY AS- REALLY

PROVIDED FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH-

03:47:26.132 --> 03:47:27.300

SERVICES OR WHEN IT'S IN THE I.

03:47:28.768 --> 03:47:30.036
U. P. DEPENDING ON WHICH

03:47:30.103 --> 03:47:31.604
PORTION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT-

03:47:31.671 --> 03:47:33.573
AND THERE ARE COUNTIES HAD. WHO

03:47:33.639 --> 03:47:34.774
HAVE EXPANDED TO THE NON

03:47:34.841 --> 03:47:37.243
SPECIALTY SIDE TOO EVEN THOUGH

03:47:37.310 --> 03:47:38.177
ULTIMATELY THAT RESPONSIBILITY

03:47:38.244 --> 03:47:40.713
IS MANAGED CARE PLANS. HOWEVER

03:47:40.780 --> 03:47:41.814
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:47:41.881 --> 03:47:42.949
CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR

03:47:43.016 --> 03:47:44.717
FULL RIGHTS UNDER U. P. S. U.

03:47:44.784 --> 03:47:46.452
D.N. UNDER MEDICAID TO ALL

03:47:46.519 --> 03:47:48.154
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND

ALL MEDICAL SERVICES- AND SO

03:47:50.390 --> 03:47:51.924
BY. GIVING THE MANAGED CARE

03:47:51.991 --> 03:47:54.894
PLANS INTO THE SCHOOLS WELL WE

03:47:54.961 --> 03:47:56.129
DO NEED TO HAVE BETTER UP

03:47:56.195 --> 03:47:57.530
COORDINATION WITH OUR COUNTY

03:47:57.597 --> 03:47:59.499
PARTNERS IT ALSO ALLOWS ALL OF

03:47:59.565 --> 03:48:01.501
THOSE OTHER NON BEHAVIORAL

03:48:01.567 --> 03:48:03.369
HEALTH MEDIC HEALTH SERVICES.

03:48:03.436 --> 03:48:04.470
TO BE AVAILABLE FOR THOSE

03:48:04.537 --> 03:48:09.442
CHILDREN. THE SCHOOLS AS WELL

03:48:09.509 --> 03:48:10.309
SO THERE IS THAT ADDITIONAL.

03:48:10.376 --> 03:48:11.577
OPPORTUNITY WITH THE LEVERAGE

03:48:11.644 --> 03:48:12.678
THE STOCK. IN PUTTING THE AND-

03:48:12.745 --> 03:48:14.647
IN PLACE THAT DISTRICTS- CAN

03:48:14.714 --> 03:48:15.882
REMOVE THOSE BARRIERS REPORT

03:48:15.948 --> 03:48:17.283
FOR A LONG TIME THAT EVERYONE

03:48:17.350 --> 03:48:19.152
WANTS TO BE IN THE SPACE. BUT

03:48:19.218 --> 03:48:20.653
THEY CAN'T DO IT BECAUSE THEY

03:48:20.720 --> 03:48:22.155
DON'T THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW

03:48:22.221 --> 03:48:23.222
TO BILL MEDICARE HEALTH THEY

03:48:23.289 --> 03:48:24.724
DON'T HAVE THE DATA SYSTEMS TO

03:48:24.791 --> 03:48:25.358
DO IT THEY DON'T HAVE THE

03:48:25.425 --> 03:48:27.126
BILLING SYSTEMS TO DO IT. AND

03:48:27.193 --> 03:48:28.861
SO THESE INCENTIVE DOLLARS ARE

03:48:28.928 --> 03:48:30.763
REALLY MEANT TO REMOVE THOSE

03:48:30.830 --> 03:48:31.898
HISTORICAL BARRIERS THAT WE'VE

03:48:31.964 --> 03:48:33.433
HEARD. I TO BE ABLE TO GET A

03:48:33.499 --> 03:48:35.068
SPACE WHERE CHILDREN CAN

03:48:35.134 --> 03:48:36.469
MAXIMIZE THEIR FULL MEDICARE

03:48:36.536 --> 03:48:38.271
BENEFIT AND NOT JUST A VERY

03:48:38.337 --> 03:48:40.173
SMALL PORTION WHICH IS

03:48:40.239 --> 03:48:41.941
CURRENTLY BEING PROVIDED TODAY.

03:48:42.008 --> 03:48:43.676
THROUGH IF SO THE PLANS ARE

03:48:43.743 --> 03:48:44.577
ALREADY WILL BE DOING IT WHY

03:48:44.644 --> 03:48:46.879
AREN'T THEY AND WHY DO WE THINK

03:48:46.946 --> 03:48:48.614
THIS INCENTIVE IS GOING TO BE

03:48:48.681 --> 03:48:50.316
ENOUGH. TO INCENTIVIZE THEM.

03:48:50.383 --> 03:48:51.651
IT'S REALLY THE PIECES I WAS

03:48:51.717 --> 03:48:53.086
TALKING ABOUT EARLIER YOU KNOW

03:48:53.152 --> 03:48:55.188
IT IS COMPLEX JUST TO BE CLEAR

03:48:55.254 --> 03:48:58.324
THIS IS. NOT EASY TO DO- BUT

03:48:58.391 --> 03:48:59.292
WE'VE HEARD YOU KNOW SCHOOL

03:48:59.358 --> 03:49:01.561
DISTRICTS- HISTORICALLY HAVE

03:49:01.627 --> 03:49:03.162
HAD CHALLENGES UNDERSTANDING

03:49:03.229 --> 03:49:04.430
YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S

03:49:04.497 --> 03:49:05.031
NEGOTIATING WITH THE MANAGED

03:49:05.098 --> 03:49:08.134
CARE PLAN- HOW TO BILL HAVING

03:49:08.201 --> 03:49:09.535
BUILT SYSTEMS THAT ALLOW FOR

03:49:09.602 --> 03:49:11.504
THEM TO BILL- AND THEN BE

03:49:11.571 --> 03:49:14.640
REIMBURSED- FOR SERVICES-

03:49:14.707 --> 03:49:17.143
XTERRA. AND SO THAT'S WHY DO

03:49:17.210 --> 03:49:18.778
THESE BONDS ARE FORCED THE

03:49:18.845 --> 03:49:19.645
SERVICES THAT'S ALREADY BUILT

03:49:21.180 --> 03:49:22.381
REGARDS TO THE CAPITATION RATES

03:49:22.448 --> 03:49:24.283
GOING OUT. THIS IS REALLY TO DO

03:49:24.350 --> 03:49:25.585
THE ACTUAL INFRASTRUCTURE

03:49:25.651 --> 03:49:27.854
NECESSARY SO IF THEY WANT TO

03:49:27.920 --> 03:49:29.856
CONVENE- THE PLAN AS SCHOOL

03:49:29.922 --> 03:49:31.524
DISTRICT IN COUNTY TO HAVE A

03:49:31.591 --> 03:49:32.925
PLANNING PROCESS TO FIGURE OUT

03:49:32.992 --> 03:49:34.527
HOW THEY'RE GOING TO INCREASE.

03:49:34.594 --> 03:49:35.761
THE INCENTIVE DOLLARS CAN PAPER

03:49:35.828 --> 03:49:37.763
THAT PLANNING AFTER IF YOU PLAY

03:49:37.830 --> 03:49:38.998

03:49:39.065 --> 03:49:41.234
COME IN I TO HELP. MOVE THE

03:49:41.300 --> 03:49:42.902
NEEDLE IN THE SPACE OR TO PUT

03:49:42.969 --> 03:49:44.137
IN THE BILLING SYSTEM OR DATA

03:49:44.203 --> 03:49:46.839
SHARING SYSTEM. OR A TELEHEALTH

03:49:46.906 --> 03:49:47.740
PORTAL THAT COULD BE IN THE

03:49:47.807 --> 03:49:49.408
SCHOOLS. THAT ALLOW FOR THE

03:49:49.475 --> 03:49:51.911
SERVICES TO BE EASIER ACCESS-

03:49:51.978 --> 03:49:53.079

03:49:53.146 --> 03:49:54.747
INFRASTRUCTURE OUR PARTNERSHIP

03:49:54.814 --> 03:49:57.049
AND CAPACITY BUILDING- WHICH IS

03:49:57.116 --> 03:49:58.417
WHAT WE HAVE HISTORICALLY HEARD

03:49:58.484 --> 03:50:00.119
ARE THE MAIN BARRIERS FOR BOTH

03:50:00.186 --> 03:50:01.320
MANAGED CARE PLANS YOU WANT TO

03:50:01.387 --> 03:50:02.722

03:50:02.788 --> 03:50:05.124
DISTRICTS TO KIND OF GET OVER

03:50:05.191 --> 03:50:07.026
THOSE HUMPS INSTEAD OF JUST.

03:50:07.093 --> 03:50:09.328
COVERING IT WITH LOCAL FUNDS WE

03:50:09.395 --> 03:50:10.930
SHOULD BE MAXIMIZING THE

03:50:10.997 --> 03:50:12.498
FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT ALLOW FOR

03:50:12.565 --> 03:50:14.200
US TO DRAW DOWN HERE. AS AS

03:50:14.267 --> 03:50:15.801
WELL AS THE DOLLARS THAT WE PAY

03:50:15.868 --> 03:50:17.003
OUR MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS

03:50:17.069 --> 03:50:18.571
IN THIS SPACE AND SO IT'S

03:50:18.638 --> 03:50:20.306
REALLY ABOUT BEING PRUDENT WITH

THE FUNDS THAT ARE IN THE

03:50:21.474 --> 03:50:24.043

03:50:26.445 --> 03:50:27.980
INCENTIVE IS GOOD BECAUSE IT'S-

03:50:28.047 --> 03:50:29.248
REMOVING SOME OF THOSE

03:50:29.315 --> 03:50:30.316
HISTORICAL BARRIERS FOR WHITE

DON'T WANT US AND AT ONE POINT

03:51:22.768 --> 03:51:24.203
OUT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE

03:51:24.270 --> 03:51:26.272
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. THEY

03:51:26.339 --> 03:51:28.074
DON'T HAVE OR AND THERE'S A

03:51:28.140 --> 03:51:28.975
THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS BY

03:51:29.041 --> 03:51:29.976
THE WAY WHO WERE THOUSAND

OF THE LARGER ONES DO BUT FOR

03:51:34.580 --> 03:51:35.815
GENERALLY THEY'RE NOT

03:51:35.881 --> 03:51:37.550
INTERESTED IN HIRING A BUNCH OF

03:51:37.617 --> 03:51:39.318

03:51:54.767 --> 03:51:56.636
EDUCATION. BUT I WOULD SAY

03:51:56.702 --> 03:51:58.671
FIRST OF ALL IS A REQUIREMENT

03:51:58.738 --> 03:52:00.072
THAT THE MANAGED CARE COMPANY

03:52:00.139 --> 03:52:01.907

COMPELLED TO ACTUALLY TALK TO

03:52:13.185 --> 03:52:14.553
THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS BECAUSE

03:52:14.620 --> 03:52:15.921
YOU CAN'T EXPECT SCHOOL

03:52:15.988 --> 03:52:17.023

OF THEM. IT'S THIS IS LIKE IT'S

03:54:08.434 --> 03:54:10.035

IS. I MEAN THAT'S A REALLY HARD

03:54:27.286 --> 03:54:28.988
PLACE TO BE AND I'M NOT SURE

03:54:29.054 --> 03:54:30.389
JUST LAW SCHOOL DISTRICTS ONE

03:54:30.456 --> 03:54:31.557
EVEN BE IN THAT PLACE AND

03:54:31.624 --> 03:54:33.259
THAT'S WHY ANSWER SAY. INS AND

03:54:33.325 --> 03:54:34.493
SOME WAYS THAT IT IN THIS

03:54:34.560 --> 03:54:36.462
ACTUALLY. MY PERSPECTIVE SPEAKS

03:54:36.529 --> 03:54:39.231

BE SURE ANY CAN IS A MEDIC CAL

03:54:47.139 --> 03:54:47.873

03:54:47.940 --> 03:54:49.208
WHERE IF YOU'RE MEDICARE NOT

03:54:49.275 --> 03:54:50.543
MEDI CAL BUT IF YOU'RE ON

03:54:50.609 --> 03:54:52.478
MEDICARE AL. THERE NEEDS TO BE

03:54:52.545 --> 03:54:54.447
A UNIVERSAL SYSTEM FOR THE

03:54:54.513 --> 03:54:55.347
SCHOOL DISTRICT SO THEY'RE NOT

03:54:55.414 --> 03:54:56.749
CENTER SORTING OUT WHICH PLAN

03:54:56.816 --> 03:54:57.917

NOT AND YOU GET THE SERVICE

03:55:00.653 --> 03:55:02.254
RIGHT. AND THEN THERE SOME

03:55:02.321 --> 03:55:03.722
SYSTEMATIC WAY THAT THEY'RE

03:55:03.789 --> 03:55:04.890
GETTING AND BY THE WAY THEY

03:55:04.957 --> 03:55:06.025
DON'T HAVE DIFFERENT BILLING

03:55:06.091 --> 03:55:07.827
PROCESSES FOR DIFFERENT PLANS

03:55:07.893 --> 03:55:08.761
BECAUSE THE AND ARE NOT

03:55:08.828 --> 03:55:10.229
INTENDED TO CATION SPACE THEY

03:55:10.296 --> 03:55:11.197
DON'T HAVE A BUNCH OF STAFF

03:55:11.263 --> 03:55:12.565
SAYING. I HAVE TO FILL THESE

03:55:12.631 --> 03:55:14.300
FORMS FOR THIS PLAN THAT FOR

03:55:14.366 --> 03:55:16.769
THAT PLANT IS- IN FACT. IF

03:55:16.836 --> 03:55:19.038
THERE FRANKLY I WOULD SAY IS

03:55:19.104 --> 03:55:21.340
THAT IS THERE FOR SCHOOL BASED

03:55:21.407 --> 03:55:23.342
SERVICES. THAT THAT THAT THEY

03:55:23.409 --> 03:55:24.977
MIGHT PAY FOR THAT YOU WOULD

03:55:25.044 --> 03:55:26.579
ACTUALLY DEVELOP A STANDARDIZED

03:55:26.645 --> 03:55:27.980
BOTH BILLING SYSTEM THAT'S VERY

03:55:28.047 --> 03:55:32.117
SIMPLIFIED. AND ALSO SOME SORT

03:55:32.184 --> 03:55:33.252
OF A BECAUSE YOU GOT TO MAKE IT

03:55:33.319 --> 03:55:34.487
REALLY SIMPLE AT SCHOOL

03:55:34.553 --> 03:55:35.688
DISTRICT AND BECAUSE THE SCHOOL

03:55:35.754 --> 03:55:37.122
DISTRICT IS NOT A HEALTH CARE

03:55:37.189 --> 03:55:39.124
FACILITY ALL RIGHT NOW A CLINIC

03:55:39.191 --> 03:55:40.493
THEY CAN DEVELOP WHOLE BILLING

03:55:40.559 --> 03:55:41.627
SYSTEM SO FOR EXAMPLE IN A HOLE

03:55:41.694 --> 03:55:42.595
RIGHT TO SERVICES AT SENTARA

03:55:42.661 --> 03:55:44.630
HOSPITAL. EVEN A DOCTOR'S

03:55:44.697 --> 03:55:47.166
OFFICE THE SCHOOL DISTRICT YOU

03:55:47.233 --> 03:55:48.634

WE MAKE IT. TOO COMPLEX WE'RE

03:57:05.878 --> 03:57:09.348
TALKING ABOUT HAVING CONTRACTS

CHIEF THE AIM TO ACHIEVE SO. I

03:57:25.798 --> 03:57:26.932
REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT

03:57:26.999 --> 03:57:27.700
YOU'RE MAKING AN EFFORT IN THIS

03:57:27.766 --> 03:57:28.968
PROPOSAL BUT JUST FROM MY OWN

03:57:29.034 --> 03:57:31.070
EXPERIENCE. AND THEN MY OWN

03:57:31.136 --> 03:57:31.937
KNOWLEDGE TALKING TO SCHOOL

03:57:32.004 --> 03:57:33.238
DISTRICTS I MEAN AFTER ALL THIS

03:57:33.305 --> 03:57:35.708
THIS WAY- WHEN I WAS HERE

03:57:35.774 --> 03:57:36.842

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT STATION TO

03:57:41.947 --> 03:57:43.882
TALK TO EACH OTHER. ABOUT ELLIE

03:57:43.949 --> 03:57:45.784
A BILL EVEN MEET AND HOW WE GOT

03:57:45.851 --> 03:57:47.319
A MEETING GOING. I MEAN THAT'S

03:57:47.386 --> 03:57:48.253
THE DISTANCE THAT WE'RE STILL

03:57:48.320 --> 03:57:50.255
TRYING TO CROSS AND THINGS ARE

03:57:50.322 --> 03:57:52.124
BETTER NOW BUT- I THINK YOU

03:57:52.191 --> 03:57:53.092
REALLY DO HAVE TO LOOK AT IT

03:57:53.158 --> 03:57:54.159
FROM THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND

03:57:54.226 --> 03:57:55.094
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHAT

03:57:55.160 --> 03:57:55.894
YOU'RE UP TAKE PROBLEMS GOING

03:57:55.961 --> 03:57:57.730
TO BE. AND IF YOU DON'T MAKE

THE MANAGED CARE COMPANIES DO

03:57:58.897 --> 03:58:00.933
SOMETHING YOU KNOW. BE ABLE TO

03:58:01.000 --> 03:58:02.034

DISTRICTS AND SOMETHING

03:58:03.202 --> 03:58:05.404
CONSISTENT ACROSS. THEN YOU

03:58:05.471 --> 03:58:07.306

03:58:07.373 --> 03:58:09.141
THIS NOT JUST INCENTIVES. IT

03:58:09.208 --> 03:58:12.411
HAS TO BE A SET UP A SERVER.

03:58:12.478 --> 03:58:12.878
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S

03:58:12.945 --> 03:58:15.014
DEVELOPED. WITH THE USER IN

03:58:15.080 --> 03:58:16.615

THINGS THAT WE HAVE BEEN-

03:58:27.226 --> 03:58:28.761
THINKING THROUGH ON OUR SIDE

03:58:28.827 --> 03:58:31.030
BECAUSE WE DO KNOW THAT- SOME

03:58:31.096 --> 03:58:32.431
OF THE LARGEST CHALLENGES WOULD

03:58:32.498 --> 03:58:33.699
BE FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICT

03:58:33.766 --> 03:58:35.668
ESPECIALLY. IN PARTS OF THE

03:58:35.734 --> 03:58:39.071
STATE- SACRAMENTO AND SAN DIEGO

FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THERE ARE SO

03:58:40.172 --> 03:58:41.974
MANY MANAGED CARE PLANS. WE'VE

03:58:42.041 --> 03:58:43.375

TO THINK THROUGH THOSE THINGS

03:58:58.190 --> 03:58:59.992
AND I THINK. I WOULD BE HAPPY

03:59:00.059 --> 03:59:01.293
