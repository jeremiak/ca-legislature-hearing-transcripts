AND SHE STARTED THAT JOURNEY A

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:14.845
YEAR AND A HALF AGO.

00:50:14.911 --> 00:50:17.447

FEELS ARE LEAVING BECAUSE OF HER.

00:50:48.779 --> 00:50:51.047

IT SENDS AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE

00:52:40.891 --> 00:52:41.124
[INAUDIBLE]

PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE THEM OF

00:52:55.705 --> 00:52:57.240
WORKERS TO STAY EMPLOYED A LOT

00:52:57.307 --> 00:53:00.710
OF DIFFERENT THINGS.

00:53:00.777 --> 00:53:01.278
AT U. C. P. WERE MORE MORE

00:53:01.344 --> 00:53:03.013

00:53:05.515 --> 00:53:07.183
HAVE -- HAVE SEEN THE INCREASE

00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:10.820
AND SOME HAVE NOT AND THERE'S A

00:53:10.887 --> 00:53:13.189
TRANSITION GOING ON AS WELL.

00:53:13.256 --> 00:53:13.857
HOW THAT MIGHT LOOK WITH THE NEW

00:53:13.924 --> 00:53:16.860
AGE CBS REGULATIONS OR WHATEVER?

00:53:16.927 --> 00:53:19.362
I WILL ONLY ADD THAT HAVE A

00:53:19.429 --> 00:53:23.066
RANGE OF CONSUMER CHOICES.

00:53:23.133 --> 00:53:23.733
HELPS TO REVIVE THE RICH QUALITY

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:27.070
OF LIFE IT'S IT'S IT'S MORE THAN

00:53:27.137 --> 00:53:27.671
JUST IT'S IMPORTANT WHERE THEY

00:53:27.737 --> 00:53:27.871
LIVE.

00:53:27.938 --> 00:53:28.738
WE GET THAT.

00:53:28.805 --> 00:53:31.308
BUT I THINK WHAT THEY'RE DOING

00:53:31.374 --> 00:53:33.476
IN THEIR IN THEIR IN THEIR HOURS

00:53:33.543 --> 00:53:34.077
TO DATE IN RICHER LIVES OR

00:53:34.144 --> 00:53:37.080
EDUCATE IN THEIR WORK

00:53:37.147 --> 00:53:38.882
POSSIBILITIES AND ALL THOSE.

00:53:38.949 --> 00:53:39.516
I THINK ARE GOING TO BE VERY.

00:53:39.583 --> 00:53:43.353
LONG WAY AND SO I THINK -- AS A

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:46.923
STATE AS A GROUP OF PEOPLE.

00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:48.992
WE NEED MORE CARE IN TERMS OF

00:53:49.059 --> 00:53:51.294
HOW WE'RE MAKING OUR CHOICES.

00:53:51.361 --> 00:53:51.895
WHAT WE FIND IN WHAT WE DON'T

00:53:51.962 --> 00:53:52.195
[INAUDIBLE]

00:53:52.262 --> 00:53:55.498
AND AGAIN WE'RE HERE TO HELP IF

00:53:55.565 --> 00:53:57.233
YOU NOT SURE ABOUT SOMETHING WE

00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:59.269
CAN GIVE YOU SOME INSIGHT

00:53:59.336 --> 00:54:03.006
ESTARÁ THINGS ARE GOING.

00:54:03.073 --> 00:54:03.673
WE ALSO ARE LIKE A LOT OF OTHER

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:05.175
PROVIDERS IN THE ROOM I DON'T

00:54:05.241 --> 00:54:06.810
WANT TO SPEAK FOR THEM TOTALLY

00:54:06.876 --> 00:54:09.245
BUT IT'S IT'S VERY HARD TO KEEP

00:54:09.312 --> 00:54:09.546
GOOD STAFF.

00:54:09.613 --> 00:54:13.650
BASED ON WHAT THE WAGES ARE

00:54:13.717 --> 00:54:13.984
LOOKING LIKE.

00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:15.452
AND EVEN WITH THE BUMPS IN.

00:54:15.518 --> 00:54:17.187
IN THE MINIMUM WAGE I THINK CAN

00:54:17.253 --> 00:54:21.124
ALL AGREE THOSE ARE NOT LIVEABLE

00:54:21.191 --> 00:54:22.892
WAGE LAWS ARE MINIMUM WAGE.

00:54:22.959 --> 00:54:23.460
SO I THINK IT'S A MATTER OF

00:54:23.526 --> 00:54:25.395
PROTECTING THAT AND ALONG WITH

00:54:25.462 --> 00:54:26.796
THAT QUALITY PEOPLE ARE WORKING

00:54:26.863 --> 00:54:27.030
THERE.

00:54:27.097 --> 00:54:28.932
AND GOOD SERVICES ARE BEING PUT

00:54:28.999 --> 00:54:31.468
FORTH SAFE SERVICES IMPORTANT

00:54:31.534 --> 00:54:33.236
SERVICE SAYS.

00:54:33.303 --> 00:54:34.804
I WON'T BE ON TRANSITIONING SOME

00:54:34.871 --> 00:54:36.840
OF OURS TO NEW REGULATIONS

00:54:36.906 --> 00:54:38.975
COMING UP AND I THINK IT'S IT'S

00:54:39.042 --> 00:54:39.576
FOR GOAL TO STAY THE SAME ALL

00:54:39.643 --> 00:54:41.111
THE TIME AND THAT'S NOT WHAT

00:54:41.177 --> 00:54:41.678
WE'RE THERE FOR WE TRY TO BE

00:54:41.745 --> 00:54:41.978
INNOVATIVE.

00:54:42.045 --> 00:54:46.850
WE TRY TO PROVIDE GOOD SERVICES --

00:54:46.916 --> 00:54:49.152
IT'LL TAKE TIME SO WE NEED TO BE

00:54:49.219 --> 00:54:50.887
CAREFUL AGAIN AS WERE.

00:54:50.954 --> 00:54:51.588
WERE DECIDING WHAT WE FIND WHAT

00:54:51.655 --> 00:54:53.123
WE DON'T FUND BECAUSE THERE'S A

00:54:53.189 --> 00:54:57.027
TRANSITION GOING ON AND IT COULD

00:54:57.093 --> 00:54:57.260
CAUSE.

00:54:57.327 --> 00:54:59.162
SOME COULD STORE STAFF.

00:54:59.229 --> 00:55:02.999
BECAUSE CONSTRUED PROGRAMS.

00:55:03.066 --> 00:55:03.633
YES I THINK AGAIN I WOULD ONLY

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:07.037
SAY LET'S SPEAKER -- CARLOS

00:55:07.103 --> 00:55:07.637
FLORES MENTION OBVIOUSLY WHICH

00:55:07.704 --> 00:55:09.406
WERE ALL AWARE OF THE PLAN --

00:55:09.472 --> 00:55:11.274
ENACT.

00:55:11.341 --> 00:55:11.908
OUR I REALLY DO THINK THAT'S

00:55:11.975 --> 00:55:14.878
WHAT SEPARATES US FROM THE REST

00:55:14.944 --> 00:55:15.545
OF THE NATION IN THE WORLD HAVE

00:55:15.612 --> 00:55:17.280
ENTITLEMENTS NOBODY ELSE HAS I

00:55:17.347 --> 00:55:19.182
THINK WE SHOULD BE.

00:55:19.249 --> 00:55:21.051
FIERCELY PROUD OF THAT I THINK

00:55:21.117 --> 00:55:23.119
IT IT SHOWS UP IN THE FACT THAT

00:55:23.186 --> 00:55:24.788
THERE ARE NOT LONG WAITING LISTS

00:55:24.854 --> 00:55:27.157
FOR SERVICES IN OUR STATE.

00:55:27.223 --> 00:55:27.824
TALKING TO COUNTERPARTS PART OF

00:55:27.891 --> 00:55:29.192
A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION THAT YOU

00:55:29.259 --> 00:55:33.129
SEE P..

00:55:33.196 --> 00:55:34.764
WHAT CLICK IN THE STATE'S IN

00:55:34.831 --> 00:55:36.700
TEXAS AND ARIZONA THEY'RE

00:55:36.766 --> 00:55:37.367
THEY'RE QUEUING UP WITH NOWHERE

00:55:37.434 --> 00:55:38.768
TO GO AND I THINK CALIFORNIA IS

00:55:38.835 --> 00:55:41.137
DOING A BETTER JOB WITH THAT?

00:55:41.204 --> 00:55:42.839
AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS.

00:55:42.906 --> 00:55:45.108
TO HELP GUIDE US SO I THINK WE

00:55:45.175 --> 00:55:47.377
WANT TO BE WE WILL BE VERY

00:55:47.444 --> 00:55:49.212
PROTECTIVE OF IT AND WE SHOULD

00:55:49.279 --> 00:55:50.814
BE VERY PROUD OF IT WE ARE

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:51.448
DIFFERENT THAN EVERYBODY ELSE.

00:55:51.514 --> 00:55:53.016
SOME.

00:55:53.083 --> 00:55:55.051
BUT I I AGAIN WE DO A LOT OF

00:55:55.118 --> 00:55:56.820
DIFFERENT THINGS AND I I THINK

00:55:56.886 --> 00:55:58.755
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT.

00:55:58.822 --> 00:56:01.057
CONSUMERS HAVE A CHOICE THE

00:56:01.124 --> 00:56:03.093
THREE SELF DETERMINATION IF IT'S

00:56:03.159 --> 00:56:05.128
NOT THAT WAY AT ANY RATE IT

00:56:05.195 --> 00:56:05.762
NEEDS TO BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:09.099
SOMEBODY TO ENRICH THEIR LIVES.

00:56:09.165 --> 00:56:11.234

00:59:25.828 --> 00:59:29.132
PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE IN THE TWO

00:59:29.198 --> 00:59:29.399
PROGRAMS.

00:59:29.465 --> 00:59:33.002
AND THAT FULL EMPLOYMENT.

00:59:33.069 --> 00:59:35.271
AT 16% UNEMPLOYMENT IT'S REALLY

00:59:35.338 --> 00:59:37.073
DIFFICULT FOR US FIND PLACEMENT

00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:38.975
FOR A LOT OF OUR PEOPLE.

00:59:39.042 --> 00:59:43.446
OUR ARK HAS OPENED BUSINESSES TO

00:59:43.513 --> 00:59:45.148
PROVIDE EMPLOYMENT FOR PEOPLE WE

00:59:45.214 --> 00:59:47.283
OPEN UP AN ENTERTAINMENT CENTER.

00:59:47.350 --> 00:59:49.285
WE HAVE TWO RESTAURANTS PLUS A

00:59:49.352 --> 00:59:51.154
COMMERCIAL KITCHEN IT SOUNDS

00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:53.623
GROOVY THAT WE DO ALL THIS STUFF

00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:54.257
BUT IT'S JUST MORE HEADACHE FOR

00:59:54.324 --> 00:59:55.358
US BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW

00:59:55.425 --> 00:59:56.993
RESTAURANTS ARE.

00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:59.095
ARE DIFFICULT.

00:59:59.162 --> 01:00:01.464
ON TUESDAY WAS A GOOD DAY YES HE

01:00:01.531 --> 01:00:02.999
WAS A BAD DAY.

01:00:03.066 --> 01:00:05.501
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO TO TRY TO

01:00:05.568 --> 01:00:06.869
KEEP THINGS GOING IT'S DIFFICULT

01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:07.337
TO FUND RAISE WHEN.

01:00:07.403 --> 01:00:09.405
THERE'S JUST THAT MUCH LITTLE

01:00:09.472 --> 01:00:11.207
POT.

01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:13.343
AND THE OTHER ISSUE THAT I WANT

01:00:13.409 --> 01:00:13.977
TO BRING UP HAVING TO DO WITH

01:00:14.043 --> 01:00:17.046
UNEMPLOYMENT IN EVERY SINGLE ONE

01:00:17.113 --> 01:00:18.982

PEOPLE DIDN'T SHOW UP.

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:32.996
OURS CONSUMERS ARE OLDER NOW WE

01:00:33.062 --> 01:00:36.866
FAIL AND THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT

01:00:36.933 --> 01:00:37.500
THEY KNOW THEY HAVE TWO VERSES

01:00:37.567 --> 01:00:41.137
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE PAY.

01:00:41.204 --> 01:00:43.106
PEOPLE ARE NOT SHOWING UP.

01:00:43.172 --> 01:00:45.241
AND IT'S SCARY FOR US BECAUSE

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:47.243
YOU KNOW WE CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH.

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:49.212
AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE KEEP

01:00:49.278 --> 01:00:51.514
THAT IN MIND THAT WE NEED TO DO

01:00:51.581 --> 01:00:53.149
SOME THINGS SO THAT THE WE CAN

01:00:53.216 --> 01:00:53.416
ATTRACT.

VERY IMPORTANT SERVICES AS

01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:07.230
MONEY THAT WE HAVE TO HIRE

01:01:07.296 --> 01:01:10.700
PROFESSIONALS.

01:01:10.767 --> 01:01:13.102

01:15:13.141 --> 01:15:17.145
I CAN LIVE INDEPENDENTLY.

01:15:17.212 --> 01:15:20.949
ALWAYS SUPPORTS IT.

01:15:21.016 --> 01:15:22.951
THOUGH SOME PARTS COST MONEY.

01:15:23.018 --> 01:15:25.087
THIS ISN'T ROCKET SCIENCE.

01:15:25.153 --> 01:15:27.389
STAFF AND DECENT MAN PROVIDERS

01:15:27.456 --> 01:15:30.726
NEED A RATE INCREASE EVEN MORE

01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:33.328
BUT YOU KNOW THAT.

01:15:33.395 --> 01:15:34.863
YOU KNOW WHAT.

01:15:34.930 --> 01:15:36.865
AND YOUR HUNDRED AGAIN TONIGHT.

01:15:36.932 --> 01:15:38.967
SO WHAT IS KIND NEED.

01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:41.303
AND WHAT DO THOUSANDS WITH NO

01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:43.038
ACTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL

01:15:43.105 --> 01:15:44.806
DISABILITIES NEED.

01:15:44.873 --> 01:15:47.209
AS THREE BULLETS.

01:15:47.276 --> 01:15:51.046
I BELIEVE THEY NEED YOUR HELP.

01:15:51.113 --> 01:15:53.015
TO ENSURE THE MONEY FROM THE

01:15:53.081 --> 01:15:55.083
CLOSURES OF VALEMOUNT CENTERS.

01:15:55.150 --> 01:15:58.854

DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS ARE

01:16:21.443 --> 01:16:23.145
SITTING ON PRIME PROPERTY IS

01:16:23.211 --> 01:16:27.115
WORTH EIGHT TONS OF MONEY.

01:16:27.182 --> 01:16:31.687
THOSE MUST REMAIN IN A DEDICATED

01:16:31.753 --> 01:16:32.888

01:30:17.078 --> 01:30:19.013

SHE HAD CONSISTENT -- SUPPORTS

01:30:21.482 --> 01:30:21.783
AND SERVICES.

01:30:21.849 --> 01:30:24.819
SO YAY FOR SELF DETERMINATION.

01:30:24.886 --> 01:30:26.954
AND THE ROLLOUT IS JUST UNDERWAY

01:30:27.021 --> 01:30:27.588
HERE WE'VE GOT A GREAT TEAM OF

01:30:27.655 --> 01:30:28.856
PEOPLE.

01:30:28.923 --> 01:30:31.225
AND I DO WANT TO MENTION I THINK

01:30:31.292 --> 01:30:32.760
EVERYONE IN THIS AUDIENCE IS

01:30:32.827 --> 01:30:34.862
HERE BECAUSE OUR COMMUNITY IS

01:30:34.929 --> 01:30:37.165
VERY COHESIVE -- WE MIGHT NOT

01:30:37.231 --> 01:30:39.033
AGREE ON EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME

01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:41.102
AND I'M KEY POINTS PEOPLE REALLY

01:30:41.169 --> 01:30:42.804
DO COME TOGETHER.

01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:43.437
AND CURLESS MENTIONED HOW THEY

01:30:43.504 --> 01:30:45.106
SUPPORT VARIOUS EVENTS AND THE

01:30:45.173 --> 01:30:47.308
TRULY DO SO WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:30:47.375 --> 01:30:49.177
PARTNERS EVERY AGENCY DOES WHAT

01:30:49.243 --> 01:30:50.845
THEY CAN'T.

01:30:50.912 --> 01:30:52.914
WE'RE VERY SMALL AGENCY SO WE

01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:53.481
REALLY COULDN'T ACCOMPLISH

01:30:53.548 --> 01:30:56.717
NEARLY ANYTHING WITHOUT THE

01:30:56.784 --> 01:30:57.251
SUPPORT OF OTHERS IN OUR

01:30:57.318 --> 01:30:58.986
COMMUNITY.

01:30:59.053 --> 01:31:00.922
SO PLEASE THE WAGE ISSUE AS YOU

01:31:00.988 --> 01:31:02.857
KNOW GOTTA BE ADDRESS SOMEHOW.

01:31:02.924 --> 01:31:04.759
THE RACE FOR PROVIDERS ARE JUST

01:31:04.826 --> 01:31:06.861
I USED TO BE A PROVIDER.

01:31:06.928 --> 01:31:09.063
AND I WAS A PROVIDER FOR TWENTY

01:31:09.130 --> 01:31:09.664
SIX YEARS I WAS A SPECIAL ED

01:31:09.730 --> 01:31:11.165
TEACHER PRIOR TO THAT.

01:31:11.232 --> 01:31:13.100
SO I KIND OF HAVE A LITTLE BIT

01:31:13.167 --> 01:31:14.869
OF EXPERIENCE AND A LOT OF AREAS

01:31:14.936 --> 01:31:16.838
AFFECTING OUR POPULATION.

01:31:16.904 --> 01:31:18.840
I'M EMPLOYMENT IS HUGE.

01:31:18.906 --> 01:31:21.008
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT THAT

WE HAVE AN EMPLOYMENT FIRST

01:31:22.877 --> 01:31:25.012

OF COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED

01:31:31.052 --> 01:31:31.285
EMPLOYMENT.

01:31:31.352 --> 01:31:32.887
IS THE PREFERRED OPTION FOR

01:31:32.954 --> 01:31:33.421
PEOPLE GETTING OUT OF THE

01:31:33.487 --> 01:31:36.991
TRANSITION PROGRAMS IN SCHOOL.

01:31:37.058 --> 01:31:37.625
AND WE REALLY NEED TO EMBRACE

01:31:37.692 --> 01:31:38.893
THAT IN OFFER VOLUNTEER

01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:41.229
OPPORTUNITIES AND INTERNSHIPS

01:31:41.295 --> 01:31:43.130
THE PAID INTERNSHIP PROGRAM THAT

01:31:43.197 --> 01:31:45.166
CAME OUT OF THE EMPLOYMENT FIRST

01:31:45.233 --> 01:31:46.767
POLICY.

01:31:46.834 --> 01:31:49.036
HOPEFULLY WILL ENCOURAGE MORE

01:31:49.103 --> 01:31:51.172
EMPLOYERS -- TO EXPERIENCE

01:31:51.239 --> 01:31:52.940
HIRING SOMEONE WITH AN

INTELLECTUAL OR DEVELOPMENTAL

01:31:53.608 --> 01:31:56.978
DISABILITY -- ATTITUDES ARE

01:31:57.044 --> 01:31:58.880
STILL NOT WITH THE SHOULD BE.

01:31:58.946 --> 01:31:59.547
AND NOW WE'RE GONNA CHANGE THAT

01:31:59.614 --> 01:32:01.215
BY EXPOSURE BY REALLY GETTING TO

01:32:01.282 --> 01:32:03.017
KNOW PEOPLE [INAUDIBLE]

01:32:03.084 --> 01:32:04.752
I'M.

01:32:04.819 --> 01:32:05.319
THERE'S OTHER PATHWAYS TO

01:32:05.386 --> 01:32:06.854
COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED

01:32:06.921 --> 01:32:07.154
EMPLOYMENT.

01:32:07.221 --> 01:32:09.056
AND CHARLIE MENTIONED HE WANTED

01:32:09.123 --> 01:32:11.025
TO GO TO COLLEGE.

01:32:11.092 --> 01:32:11.692
I'M NINE YEARS AGO WE STARTED A

01:32:11.759 --> 01:32:14.762
PROGRAM CALLED PROJECT COLLEGE.

01:32:14.829 --> 01:32:16.831
WHICH IS A GROUP OF IT IT STEMS

01:32:16.898 --> 01:32:19.100
FROM A TRANSITION COMMITTEE WE

01:32:19.166 --> 01:32:20.902
HOSTED AT OUR OFFICE.

01:32:20.968 --> 01:32:22.970
AND ONE PARENT HAD A SON WHO WAS

01:32:23.037 --> 01:32:25.039
STRUGGLING IN A SECONDARY

01:32:25.106 --> 01:32:25.339
EDUCATION.

01:32:25.406 --> 01:32:27.241
AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE INCREASE

01:32:27.308 --> 01:32:29.377
IN STUDENTS ON THE AUTISM

01:32:29.443 --> 01:32:31.245
SPECTRUM MANY OF THESE STUDENTS

01:32:31.312 --> 01:32:33.214
ARE MORE THAN CAPABLE OF GOING

01:32:33.281 --> 01:32:34.949
TO A CREDENTIALED POSTSECONDARY

01:32:35.016 --> 01:32:38.986
EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY.

01:32:39.053 --> 01:32:39.487
ON THE DID LIKE SOME OF

01:32:39.553 --> 01:32:41.155
INTERPERSONAL SKILLS IDENTITY

01:32:41.222 --> 01:32:43.190
SKILLS THINGS OF THAT NATURE THE

01:32:43.257 --> 01:32:45.026
ABILITY TO GO AND SEEK OUT THE

01:32:45.092 --> 01:32:46.994
HELP THEY NEEDED.

01:32:47.061 --> 01:32:47.595
SO WE PARTNERED WITH A LOCAL

01:32:47.662 --> 01:32:48.930
COLLEGE.

01:32:48.996 --> 01:32:51.198
AND WE RUN A ONE WEEK -- COLLEGE

01:32:51.265 --> 01:32:53.167

01:32:55.503 --> 01:32:56.904
ACTUAL COLLEGE CLASSES.

01:32:56.971 --> 01:32:59.173
AND WE'VE HAD SOME REALLY GOOD

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:01.242
SUCCESS IT'S VERY SMALL.

01:33:01.309 --> 01:33:03.177
NOT TRYING TO BLOW IT OUT OF

01:33:03.244 --> 01:33:03.811
PROPORTION WE ONLY TAKE TWELVE

01:33:03.878 --> 01:33:04.779
STUDENTS.

01:33:04.845 --> 01:33:07.081
BUT IT'S IT'S A START AND OUR

01:33:07.148 --> 01:33:09.483
GOAL IS TO HAVE THE SCHOOL.

01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:11.218
IS UNIVERSITY UNIVERSITY OF SAN

01:33:11.285 --> 01:33:13.321
DIEGO IS WHO WE PARTNER WITH

01:33:13.387 --> 01:33:15.289
ADOPT THIS IS A REGULAR OFFERING

01:33:15.356 --> 01:33:17.058
THEY HAVE EVAN PROGRAMS EVERY

01:33:17.124 --> 01:33:18.926
YEAR FOR FIRST GENERATION

01:33:18.993 --> 01:33:20.861
COLLEGE STUDENTS.

01:33:20.928 --> 01:33:23.064
WHY NOT HAVE THIS -- SO THAT'S

01:33:23.130 --> 01:33:26.801
JUST A SUGGESTION -- OUR

01:33:26.867 --> 01:33:28.869
EMPLOYMENT SERVICES.

01:33:28.936 --> 01:33:30.871
WE HAVE A HUGE EVENT LOCALLY

01:33:30.938 --> 01:33:32.840
THAT'S A COMMUNITY COLLABORATIVE

01:33:32.907 --> 01:33:34.775
OF ALL TYPES OF DISABILITIES.

01:33:34.842 --> 01:33:35.376
PEOPLE THAT ARE BLIND PEOPLE

01:33:35.443 --> 01:33:37.011
THAT ARE DEAF PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:33:37.078 --> 01:33:38.879
WITH DEPARTMENT OF REHAB PEOPLE

01:33:38.946 --> 01:33:40.781
WITH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.

01:33:40.848 --> 01:33:42.750
I'M THIS YEAR EARLY HAN HAS

01:33:42.817 --> 01:33:45.186
DONATED CHANGE ARENA FOR THIS

01:33:45.252 --> 01:33:46.954
EVENT SO CLEARLY THERE IS --

01:33:47.021 --> 01:33:48.789
SUPPORT IN THE COMMUNITY.

01:33:48.856 --> 01:33:50.758
SO THAT'S AN AWESOME EVENT

01:33:50.825 --> 01:33:53.127
HOUSING YEAH TO OTHER FOUNDATION

01:33:53.194 --> 01:33:55.029
AND CARLOS FOR HAVING THE

01:33:55.096 --> 01:33:56.797
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HOUSING

01:33:56.864 --> 01:33:57.164
COLLABORATIVE.

01:33:57.231 --> 01:33:59.200
BUT AS YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST A

01:33:59.266 --> 01:34:00.768
SMALL BITE.

01:34:00.835 --> 01:34:03.137
BECAUSE I PULLED THE STATISTICS

01:34:03.204 --> 01:34:05.006
YESTERDAY FROM THE NATIONAL LOW

01:34:05.072 --> 01:34:06.874
INCOME HOUSING COALITION.

01:34:06.941 --> 01:34:09.043
AND IN CALIFORNIA WHAT THEY

01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:09.677
CONSIDER TO BE AFFORDABLE RENT

01:34:09.744 --> 01:34:13.014
FOR AN SSI RECIPIENT IS TWO

01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:14.949
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DOLLARS. FOR

01:34:15.016 --> 01:34:17.151
A PERSON WITH A FULL TIME JOB

01:34:17.218 --> 01:34:18.919
PAYING MINIMUM WAGE WOULD BE SIX

01:34:18.986 --> 01:34:20.788
HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS.

01:34:20.855 --> 01:34:21.355
I'M I DON'T KNOW WHERE IN

01:34:21.422 --> 01:34:23.157
CALIFORNIA YOU COULD FIND THAT

01:34:23.224 --> 01:34:25.092
HOUSING [INAUDIBLE]

01:34:25.159 --> 01:34:30.798
SO IT'S CRITICAL TO INCENTIVIZE

01:34:30.865 --> 01:34:31.232
LANDLORDS PERHAPS.

01:34:31.298 --> 01:34:33.300
HOUSING DEVELOPERS THERE NEEDS

01:34:33.367 --> 01:34:34.935
TO BE SOME.

01:34:35.002 --> 01:34:37.238
SOME GIVE SOMEWHERE BECAUSE IT'S

01:34:37.304 --> 01:34:39.040
TWELVE YEAR WAIT LISTS FOR

01:34:39.106 --> 01:34:40.975
SECTION EIGHT HOUSING AND EVEN

01:34:41.042 --> 01:34:42.977
THEN IF YOU GET A VOUCHER TRY TO

01:34:43.044 --> 01:34:43.544
FIND A LANDLORDS WILLING TO

01:34:43.611 --> 01:34:44.812
ACCEPT IT.

01:34:44.879 --> 01:34:48.749
IT'S NOT AS EASY AS ALL THAT WE

01:34:48.816 --> 01:34:49.417
TELL PEOPLE YOU KNOW IF THEY ASK

01:34:49.483 --> 01:34:51.152
FOR ADVICE SAY GET ON THE

01:34:51.218 --> 01:34:53.187
WAITING LIST NOW GET ON THE

01:34:53.254 --> 01:34:53.754
WAITING LIST WHEN YOU'RE.

01:34:53.821 --> 01:34:57.124
EIGHTEEN OTHER NOT READY TO MOVE.

01:34:57.191 --> 01:34:57.391
ALRIGHT.

01:34:57.458 --> 01:34:58.726
I'M NOT GOING TO BE GETTING IT

01:34:58.793 --> 01:34:58.993
TOMORROW.

01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:01.162
MAYBE BY THE TIME THEY'RE THIRTY

01:35:01.228 --> 01:35:03.064
THEY'LL GET A AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:35:03.130 --> 01:35:04.932
LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY.

01:35:04.999 --> 01:35:08.869
SO IT'S A STRUGGLE -- WE DO THE

01:35:08.936 --> 01:35:10.938
NATIONAL CORE INDICATOR SURVEY

01:35:11.005 --> 01:35:12.840
SO WE GET FEEDBACK FROM AREAS

01:35:12.907 --> 01:35:14.909
AGE RANGES DEPENDING ON THE YEAR.

01:35:14.975 --> 01:35:16.944
THAT'S VERY INTERESTING WHEN YOU

01:35:17.011 --> 01:35:17.445
HEAR WHAT FAMILIES ARE

01:35:17.511 --> 01:35:18.779
EXPERIENCING.

01:35:18.846 --> 01:35:21.048
AND INDIVIDUALS -- PROVIDE FIRST

01:35:21.115 --> 01:35:22.950
HAND INFORMATION.

01:35:23.017 --> 01:35:25.186
THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A LITTLE

01:35:25.252 --> 01:35:27.088
BIT OF YOU KNOW FAMILIES ARE

01:35:27.154 --> 01:35:27.321
REALLY.

01:35:27.388 --> 01:35:29.256
EASY THEY THEY HAVE SO MUCH ON

01:35:29.323 --> 01:35:31.225
THEIR PLATES SOMETIMES GETTING

01:35:31.292 --> 01:35:34.762
THE INFORMATION THEY NEED IS NOT

01:35:34.829 --> 01:35:35.329
READILY ACCESSIBLE TO THEM.

01:35:35.396 --> 01:35:36.964
SO.

01:35:37.031 --> 01:35:38.966
SOMEHOW IF THERE COULD BE SOME.

01:35:39.033 --> 01:35:41.035
DATABASE SOMEWHERE OF OF

01:35:41.102 --> 01:35:42.770
INFORMATION I KNOW THERE'S MANY

01:35:42.837 --> 01:35:44.905
BUT TO REALLY STREAMLINE IT AND

01:35:44.972 --> 01:35:45.506
GET IT INTO THE HANDS OF THE

01:35:45.573 --> 01:35:47.308
FOLKS WHO STRUGGLE AND SAY I

01:35:47.374 --> 01:35:48.976
NEVER KNEW.

01:35:49.043 --> 01:35:51.212
YOU ASKED ME THIS QUESTION JUST

01:35:51.278 --> 01:35:51.545
MY CHILD GET.

01:35:51.612 --> 01:35:53.280
A RESPITE SERVICES I DIDN'T KNOW

01:35:53.347 --> 01:35:54.715
I COULD ASK FOR IT.

01:35:54.782 --> 01:35:56.817
THAT'S A PROBLEM.

01:35:56.884 --> 01:35:59.186
SO SOMEHOW WE NEED TO REALLY

01:35:59.253 --> 01:36:02.823
PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION -- AND

01:36:02.890 --> 01:36:04.892
WHAT ELSE DID I WANNA TALK THAT

01:36:04.959 --> 01:36:07.027
PROBABLY NOTHING I SHOULD HAVE

01:36:07.094 --> 01:36:07.695
JUST GOTTEN APPEARANCES DITTO TO

01:36:07.761 --> 01:36:09.063
EVERYTHING THAT WAS ALREADY SAID

01:36:09.130 --> 01:36:12.766
BECAUSE YOU KNOW AGAIN IT'S IT'S

01:36:12.833 --> 01:36:15.102
AN AWESOME COMMUNITY AND PEOPLE.

01:36:15.169 --> 01:36:17.171
TRY PEOPLE STRUGGLE OF THERE'S

01:36:17.238 --> 01:36:19.106
SO MANY PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM THAT

01:36:19.173 --> 01:36:20.875
I'VE KNOWN FOR DECADES.

01:36:20.941 --> 01:36:23.177
AND YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE TALK

01:36:23.244 --> 01:36:26.780
ABOUT THE CONSISTENCY OF STAFF

01:36:26.847 --> 01:36:29.150
WE'RE LOSING GOOD PEOPLE.

01:36:29.216 --> 01:36:30.951
SO THAT'S UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE I

01:36:31.018 --> 01:36:31.552
THINK THAT'S WHAT MAKES OUR

01:36:31.619 --> 01:36:33.020
SYSTEM SO STRONG.

01:36:33.087 --> 01:36:35.089
PEOPLE MIGHT NOT BE THE SAME

01:36:35.156 --> 01:36:35.623
AGENCY THEY MIGHT GO TO A

01:36:35.689 --> 01:36:37.224
DIFFERENT AGENCY THEY TAKE ALL

01:36:37.291 --> 01:36:38.959
THAT KNOWLEDGE WITH THEM.

01:36:39.026 --> 01:36:40.728
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO

01:36:40.794 --> 01:36:42.696
BUILD THAT.

01:36:42.763 --> 01:36:44.798
AND PROFESSIONAL LINES.

01:36:44.865 --> 01:36:46.967
THIS IS A CAREER PATH.

01:36:47.034 --> 01:36:49.203
YOU KNOW MANY MANY PEOPLE I KNOW

01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:50.905
WHO ARE A PROVIDERS IN THIS

01:43:39.279 --> 01:43:40.781
A JOB.

01:43:40.847 --> 01:43:41.415
AND FOR SOME REASON THAT'S NOT

01:43:41.481 --> 01:43:42.983
HAPPENING.

01:43:43.050 --> 01:43:45.085
SO I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO CONSIDER

01:43:45.152 --> 01:43:46.987

IF YOU ARE NOT DIPLOMA BOUND

01:44:01.068 --> 01:44:02.903
THERE'S NOT ONE SINGLE

01:44:02.970 --> 01:44:05.038
EDUCATIONAL COURSE DEGREE UNDER

01:44:05.105 --> 01:44:06.673
THE CODE AND I FEEL THAT NEEDS

01:44:06.740 --> 01:44:08.809
TO CHANGE BECAUSE THE FUNDS AND

01:44:08.875 --> 01:44:09.443
THE SUPPORT IN THE STAFF ROOM

01:44:09.509 --> 01:44:11.178

01:44:13.714 --> 01:44:15.315
PROGRAM OR OTHER PROGRAMS THERE

01:44:15.382 --> 01:44:17.217
ARE NO COURSES ARE NO CURRICULUM

01:44:17.284 --> 01:44:18.919
AND THE OUTCOMES OF REMAINED

01:44:18.986 --> 01:44:19.519
ALMOST STAGNANT FOR THE LAST

01:44:19.586 --> 01:44:20.954
SEVERAL DECADES.

01:44:21.021 --> 01:44:23.223
SO I WOULD LIKE FOR THE ASSEMBLY

01:44:23.290 --> 01:44:24.958
TO CONSIDER POSSIBLY HAVING

01:44:25.025 --> 01:44:26.660
COURSES REQUIRED FOR NON DIPLOMA

01:44:26.727 --> 01:44:28.829

01:44:41.341 --> 01:44:41.575
TECHNOLOGY.

01:44:41.642 --> 01:44:42.776
BECAUSE THEY SHOULD BE

01:44:42.843 --> 01:44:44.778
GRADUATING FROM THESE PROGRAMS

01:44:44.845 --> 01:44:46.780
EQUIPPED TO TRANSITION I THINK

01:44:46.847 --> 01:44:48.782
THAT'S ONE OF THE ASSUMPTIONS

01:44:48.849 --> 01:44:49.449
WERE MAKING THAT'S NOT IN PLACE.

01:44:49.516 --> 01:44:51.118
AND BY DOING THAT YOU COULD

01:44:51.184 --> 01:44:53.220
PROBABLY REDUCE THE CASELOAD FOR

01:44:53.286 --> 01:44:54.855
IT PIECE TEACHERS ARE DOING

01:44:54.921 --> 01:44:57.157

IF YOU HAVE THE STRUCTURE

01:44:59.426 --> 01:45:01.294
CLASSES PEOPLE COULD LEARN

01:45:01.361 --> 01:45:02.863
COLLABORATIVELY AND REDUCE THE

01:45:02.929 --> 01:45:03.430

TEACHERS AND PARENTS.

01:45:10.937 --> 01:45:11.505

IN THE BIG DREAM.

02:10:03.095 --> 02:10:05.063
OF LIVING [INAUDIBLE]

02:10:05.130 --> 02:10:06.765
SERVICE.

02:10:06.832 --> 02:10:09.168
COACH THING SOME HANDS OF

02:10:09.234 --> 02:10:10.869
WEAPONS AND THAT I BELIEVE.

02:10:10.936 --> 02:10:15.040
THEY'RE STRONGLY -- IF YOU HAVE

02:10:15.107 --> 02:10:17.276
A DISABILITY ANYONE OF WORK I

02:10:17.342 --> 02:10:20.746
FEEL LIKE YOU CAN HAVE THE RIGHT

02:10:20.812 --> 02:10:22.748
TO WORK EITHER FULL TIME OR PART

02:10:22.814 --> 02:10:23.382
TIME AND NOT EFFECTIVE -- SOCIAL

02:10:23.448 --> 02:10:26.818
SECURITY.

02:10:26.885 --> 02:10:29.621
MY NAME'S DENISE BALANCE I'M

02:10:29.688 --> 02:10:30.189
WOULD DREAM BIG INDEPENDENT

02:10:30.255 --> 02:10:30.956
LIVING SERVICES.

02:10:31.023 --> 02:10:32.991
AND SHAUNA HAS RUN INTO SOME

02:10:33.058 --> 02:10:35.127
ISSUES WHERE SHE WORKS AND SHE

02:10:35.194 --> 02:10:37.029
MAKES OVER THE THOUSAND SEVENTY

02:10:37.095 --> 02:10:38.897
TWO DOLLARS AND JUST BECAUSE YOU

02:10:38.964 --> 02:10:39.565
MAKE OVER A THOUSAND SEVENTY TWO

02:10:39.631 --> 02:10:40.933
DOLLARS.

02:10:40.999 --> 02:10:42.834
AND A SIX MONTHS PERIOD WITHIN A

02:10:42.901 --> 02:10:43.468
FIVE YEAR PERIOD YOU NO LONGER

02:10:43.535 --> 02:10:44.903
DISABLED.

02:10:44.970 --> 02:10:45.571
THEREFORE THEN HER SERVICES OR

02:10:45.637 --> 02:10:47.072
HER SSI GETS CUT THEN SHE

02:10:47.139 --> 02:10:48.974
DOESN'T WANT TO WORK SO I

02:10:49.041 --> 02:10:51.109
BELIEVE A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS

02:10:51.176 --> 02:10:51.543
POSSIBLY FOR WORK.

02:10:51.610 --> 02:10:53.245
IS THAT IF THEY WORK. THREE CAN

02:10:53.312 --> 02:10:55.214
GETS CUT TOO MUCH THEN THEY

02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:57.115
CAN'T LIVE SO IF WE COULD COME

02:10:57.182 --> 02:10:59.251
UP WITH A SOLUTION POSSIBLY.

02:10:59.318 --> 02:11:01.286
TO RAISE THE RATE WHICH THEY CAN

02:11:01.353 --> 02:11:03.188
MAKE MORE MONEY SO THEY DON'T

02:11:03.255 --> 02:11:03.455
GET CUT.

02:11:03.522 --> 02:11:05.157
THEN I THINK THAT WE WOULD SEE

02:11:05.224 --> 02:11:07.159
MORE EMPLOYMENT HAPPENING AND

02:11:07.226 --> 02:11:09.094
THAT THEY WOULD -- STANDARD JOBS

02:11:09.161 --> 02:11:11.363
LONGER ALSO I JUST ALSO WANT TO

02:11:11.430 --> 02:11:12.864
SAY I DO AGREE WITH EVERYBODY

02:11:12.931 --> 02:11:14.833
ELSE AS FAR AS LIKE WE NEED MORE

02:11:14.900 --> 02:11:18.737
WORK WAGE INCREASE BECAUSE

02:11:18.804 --> 02:11:20.772
JUSTICE THE DOM BRING.

02:11:20.839 --> 02:11:21.306
KNOWLEDGEABLE AND SKILLED

02:11:21.373 --> 02:11:22.908
EMPLOYEES TO THE FIELD AND

02:11:22.975 --> 02:11:23.542
RETAIN THEM IT'S I'VE BEEN IN

HAND.

02:11:28.847 --> 02:11:31.049
I WENT BACK TO COLLEGE AND THEN

02:11:31.116 --> 02:11:31.683
I TURN AROUND WORKED AT ARC AND

02:11:31.750 --> 02:11:33.218
THEN I JUST OPEN MY OWN AGENCY

02:11:33.285 --> 02:11:36.922
AND SO I AM SEEING THE STRUGGLES

02:11:36.989 --> 02:11:38.790
NOW THAT ARE WITH THE RATE BUT I

02:11:38.857 --> 02:11:39.458

AS IF WE DID.

02:11:46.999 --> 02:11:47.599
IT'S NOT THE MONEY THAT KEEPS US

02:11:47.666 --> 02:11:49.167

TRYING TO GET A JOB AND SUSTAIN

02:11:55.641 --> 02:11:57.209
A JOB -- JUST BECAUSE OF

OUR SECOND -- I STARTED A

02:19:45.210 --> 02:19:47.345
SUPPORT GROUP UP IN RAMONA

02:19:47.412 --> 02:19:47.979
BECAUSE WHEN I MOVED UP THERE

02:19:48.046 --> 02:19:49.180
ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO I REALIZE

02:19:49.247 --> 02:19:50.949
THAT WE WERE.

02:19:51.015 --> 02:19:52.884
VERY FAR OUT THERE AND IT WAS

02:19:52.951 --> 02:19:53.485
HARD TO GET LIKE BEHAVIORAL

02:19:53.551 --> 02:19:55.286
SUPPORTS OF THEIR TRANSPORTATION

02:19:55.353 --> 02:19:56.855
OUT THERE.

02:19:56.921 --> 02:19:59.257
AND I'VE STARTED TO MEET A LOT

02:19:59.324 --> 02:20:01.192
OF OTHER PARENTS AND I'M FINDING --

02:20:01.259 --> 02:20:03.027
WELL MY SON MIGHT GET SOME

02:20:03.094 --> 02:20:04.829

02:20:04.896 --> 02:20:06.898
PARENTS ARE BEING UNDERSERVED OR

02:20:06.965 --> 02:20:09.167
THEIR SITUATIONS ARE SO.

02:20:09.234 --> 02:20:09.734
DIFFERENT LIKE FOR EXAMPLE

02:20:09.801 --> 02:20:10.935
TRANSPORTATION.

02:20:11.002 --> 02:20:12.937
RIGHT THEY'RE HAVING A HARD TIME

02:20:13.004 --> 02:20:13.538
GETTING THEIR CHILD WHO'S AN

02:20:13.605 --> 02:20:15.073
ADULT NOW.

02:20:15.140 --> 02:20:17.075
DOWNHILL BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING

02:20:17.142 --> 02:20:17.675
NOTHING ROOM ON IN THE DAY

02:20:17.742 --> 02:20:20.779

MUCH THEY CAN PAY AND FENDER.

02:20:25.583 --> 02:20:27.218
SO IT LIMITS WHAT'S AVAILABLE TO

02:20:27.285 --> 02:20:28.987
THESE PARENTS.

02:20:29.053 --> 02:20:31.222

OF FELL THROUGH THE CRACKS.

02:20:51.676 --> 02:20:53.011

02:38:41.011 --> 02:38:42.913
MILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR.

02:38:42.980 --> 02:38:43.547
AND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

02:38:43.614 --> 02:38:44.982
DOLLARS NEXT YEAR.

02:38:45.048 --> 02:38:47.050
THAT'S PHENOMENAL THAT HASN'T

02:38:47.117 --> 02:38:49.052
HAPPENED IN DECADES SO THEY HAVE

02:38:49.119 --> 02:38:51.154
BEEN HEARING YOU AS MY

02:38:51.221 --> 02:38:52.923
COLLEAGUES MENTIONED.

02:38:52.990 --> 02:38:56.927
OF THE INCHES MAYBE.

FOR IT ALSO INCLUDES ACCESS TO

02:38:58.996 --> 02:39:01.098
STATE MINIMUM WAGE ADJUSTMENTS

02:39:01.164 --> 02:39:01.765
BECAUSE IN THE RACE IDEA EARLY

02:39:01.832 --> 02:39:03.000
IDENTIFIED THAT.

02:39:03.066 --> 02:39:04.968
THERE WAS SOME CITIES THAT

02:39:05.035 --> 02:39:06.904
ACTUALLY BUMPED THEIR MINIMUM

02:39:06.970 --> 02:39:08.805
WAGE ABOVE STATE.

02:39:08.872 --> 02:39:10.974
AND WE ARE GONNA TAKE CARE OF

02:39:11.041 --> 02:39:11.642
THAT WHAT I CALL THE QUIRKINESS.

02:39:11.708 --> 02:39:16.880
GOING.

02:39:16.947 --> 02:39:17.481
FOR AND UNLIMITED THE STATE'S

02:39:17.547 --> 02:39:18.782
NOT DOING NEARLY ENOUGH.

02:39:18.849 --> 02:39:21.318
ADD COMMUNITIES BEING LEFT

02:39:21.385 --> 02:39:23.086
BEHIND WHILE OTHER AREAS OF

02:39:23.153 --> 02:39:23.687
SOCIAL SAFETY NETS ARE BEING

02:39:23.754 --> 02:39:25.522
FULLY FUNDED [INAUDIBLE]

02:39:25.589 --> 02:39:28.692
YOU MATTER.

02:39:28.759 --> 02:39:30.861
YOU ABSOLUTELY DO MATTER.

02:39:30.928 --> 02:39:33.230
INCREASE FUNDING FOR ADD POP

02:39:33.297 --> 02:39:34.998
PROGRAMS THIS BUDGET PROVIDES.

02:39:35.065 --> 02:39:37.267
OF THEY DON'T START UNTIL

02:39:37.334 --> 02:39:40.804
JANUARY FIRST OF THE NEED IS NOW.

02:39:40.871 --> 02:39:42.773
THE FACT IS THAT SOME PROGRAMS

02:39:42.839 --> 02:39:43.440
CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT AND AS YOU

02:39:43.507 --> 02:39:45.208
MEANT HEARD SOME PROGRAMS ARE

02:39:45.275 --> 02:39:46.977
ACTUALLY GOING.

02:39:47.044 --> 02:39:48.979
TO STOP TUNE BECAUSE THE

02:39:49.046 --> 02:39:50.914
CALIFORNIA CONTINUE.

02:39:50.981 --> 02:39:53.383
THIS BUDGET DOES LEAVE A LOT OF

02:39:53.450 --> 02:39:53.951
PROGRAMS OUT AND THAT'S JUST

02:39:54.017 --> 02:39:56.954
WRONG.

02:39:57.020 --> 02:39:57.487
THESE PROGRAMS ARE STUCK

02:39:57.554 --> 02:39:59.189
STRUGGLING BECAUSE OUR STATE HAS

02:39:59.256 --> 02:40:02.926
LEGISLATORS GOVERNORS AND NOW.

02:40:02.993 --> 02:40:04.795

INCREASES.

02:40:06.897 --> 02:40:10.801
IN TWENTY YEARS.

02:40:10.867 --> 02:40:12.803
THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION.

02:40:12.869 --> 02:40:13.403
REJECTED GIVING INCREASED IS

02:40:13.470 --> 02:40:14.805
SOME PROGRAMS EVEN.

02:40:14.871 --> 02:40:17.207
THAT IT BELIEVES WILL BE OUT OF
