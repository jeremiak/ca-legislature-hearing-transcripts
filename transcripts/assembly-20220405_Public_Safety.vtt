MY HAIR ON THE TOP OF MY HEAD. I

00:40:12.143 --> 00:40:14.011

THE FIRST TIME I SOUGHT MEDICAL

00:40:15.546 --> 00:40:17.815

00:40:47.645 --> 00:40:48.445
MY EXPERIENCE THAT LAW

00:40:48.512 --> 00:40:50.414

00:40:50.481 --> 00:40:51.682
QUICKER. WHEN REPORTED BY A

00:40:51.749 --> 00:40:53.083
HEALTH CARE PROVIDER THEN IF IT

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:55.386
WAS REPORTED ON MY OWN AS A

00:40:55.452 --> 00:40:56.921
SURVIVOR AND PROFESSIONAL WHO

00:40:56.987 --> 00:40:58.522

THE REPORT EVEN IF I WANTED TO.

00:41:40.931 --> 00:41:43.000
I WAS SO PETRIFIED AND SCARED

00:41:43.067 --> 00:41:44.735
BUT I WANTED SOMEONE ELSE TO DO

00:41:44.802 --> 00:41:46.570
WHAT I COULD NOT DO. I PREFER

00:41:46.637 --> 00:41:47.938
SOMEONE ELSE DOING IT BESIDES ME

00:41:48.005 --> 00:41:49.306
BECAUSE IT WAS BAD ENOUGH

00:41:49.373 --> 00:41:50.875
KNOWING. THAT I WAS GOING TO GET

00:41:50.941 --> 00:41:52.710
BEAT UP AGAIN NO MATTER WHO IS

00:41:52.776 --> 00:41:54.778

LEAST THE BURDEN IS OFF OF ME.

00:41:59.583 --> 00:42:00.851
WHEN A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER

00:42:00.918 --> 00:42:02.486
REPORTS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. IT

00:42:02.553 --> 00:42:04.154
FEELS LIKE THEY CARE AND THAT

00:42:04.221 --> 00:42:06.523
THEY'RE ADVOCATING FOR MY SAFETY

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:07.892
AND THE SAFETY OF. MY CHILDREN.

00:42:07.958 --> 00:42:09.493
IT ALSO SENDS THE MESSAGE THAT

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.128
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS SERIOUS.

00:42:11.195 --> 00:42:13.397
AND IT'S A CRIME. MOST VICTIMS

00:42:13.464 --> 00:42:15.232
TEND TO MINIMIZE THE ABUSE. I

00:42:15.299 --> 00:42:16.100
DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THE

00:42:16.166 --> 00:42:17.735

ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR TO STOP. MY

00:42:20.104 --> 00:42:21.338
HELP BY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS

00:42:21.405 --> 00:42:22.773
REPORTING IT MIGHT BE THE THING

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:24.575
THAT SAVES THAT VICTIM'S LIFE.

00:42:24.642 --> 00:42:26.243
SOMEONE UP MAKING THAT REPORT

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:28.412
VERSUS THE VICTIM. IT REALLY IS

00:42:28.479 --> 00:42:30.314
MORE THAN ABOUT REPORTING IT IS

00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:31.548
ALSO ABOUT GETTING SURVIVORS

00:42:31.615 --> 00:42:33.584

00:42:38.022 --> 00:42:39.924
CAN BE DONE. THERE'S ACCOUNTABLE

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.791
FOR HURTING SOMEONE AND FOR NOT

00:42:40.858 --> 00:42:43.560

AMENDMENTS IN THE PAST DECADE

00:53:25.502 --> 00:53:26.603
CALIFORNIA HAS ENACTED

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:28.238
LEGISLATION MEANT TO REDUCE THE

AND TWENTY PERCENT WERE BLACK

00:53:51.828 --> 00:53:54.164
THIS IS IN PART DUE TO THE LACK

00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:56.132
OF GUIDANCE PROVIDED TO JUDGES

00:53:56.199 --> 00:53:57.767

STRENGTHEN THE FIVE CRITERIA

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:12.148
ANALYSIS BY REQUIRING A JUDGE TO

REHABILITATION IN THE JUVENILE

00:54:17.187 --> 00:54:19.289

HAVE JOHNSON LABEL WITH THE

00:54:38.375 --> 00:54:40.243
PACIFIC JUVENILE DEFENDER SYSTEM

00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:41.978
A CO SPONSOR TO THE BILL AND

00:54:42.045 --> 00:54:45.448

SUPREME COURT HAS CALLED THE

00:54:52.355 --> 00:54:53.957
DECISION TO TRANSFER YOU FROM

00:54:54.024 --> 00:54:56.192
JUVENILE COURT TO ADULT COURT.

00:54:56.259 --> 00:54:57.460
THE WORST PUNISHMENT BUT THE

00:54:57.527 --> 00:54:58.995
JUVENILE SYSTEM IS EMPOWERED TO

00:54:59.062 --> 00:55:01.464
INFLICT. A YOUTH WHO WAS

00:55:01.531 --> 00:55:02.532
TRANSFERRED TO ADULT COURT FACES

00:55:02.599 --> 00:55:04.868
EXACTLY THE SAME PUNISHMENT AS

00:55:04.934 --> 00:55:06.403
AN ADULT- COMMITTED THE SAME

00:55:06.469 --> 00:55:08.371
CRIME UP TO LIFE IN PRISON. A

00:55:08.438 --> 00:55:10.106
YOUTH WHO WAS TRANSFERRED WILL

00:55:10.173 --> 00:55:12.008
BE INCARCERATED IN THE SYSTEM

00:55:12.075 --> 00:55:14.377
THAT FOCUSES ON PUNISHMENT AND

00:55:14.444 --> 00:55:18.081
NOT REHABILITATION. AB TWENTY

00:55:18.148 --> 00:55:19.516
THREE SIXTY ONE IS A MODEST

00:55:19.582 --> 00:55:21.151
CHANGE TO CODIFY A PRINCIPLE

00:55:21.217 --> 00:55:23.086
THAT MAY ALREADY SEEM OBVIOUS IF

00:55:23.153 --> 00:55:25.422
A JUVENILE COURT JUDGE FINDS THE

00:55:25.488 --> 00:55:26.556
TO USE IS AMENABLE TO

00:55:26.623 --> 00:55:29.192
REHABILITATION. THE YOUTH SHOULD

00:55:29.259 --> 00:55:30.560
STAY IN JUVENILE COURT.

00:55:30.627 --> 00:55:31.761
CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT STATED

00:55:31.828 --> 00:55:33.630
OVER FIFTY YEARS AGO THAT THE

00:55:33.697 --> 00:55:35.598
CRITICAL QUESTION AT A TRANSFER

00:55:35.665 --> 00:55:38.034
HEARING IS THE MINERS AND MEAN

00:55:38.101 --> 00:55:39.035
ABILITY TO TREATMENT IN JUVENILE

00:55:39.102 --> 00:55:41.171
COURT. BUT OUR CURRENT STATUTES

00:55:41.237 --> 00:55:43.473
DO NOT CLEARLY REFLECT THAT

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:45.508
PRINCIPLE. INSTEAD THE CURRENT

00:55:45.575 --> 00:55:47.410
LAW PROVIDES NO GUIDANCE TO

00:55:47.477 --> 00:55:48.712
JUDGES ABOUT HOW THEY SHOULD

00:55:48.778 --> 00:55:50.880
WEIGH THE FIVE FACTORS THAT ARE

00:55:50.947 --> 00:55:53.149
CONSIDERED IN THE TRUCK IN THIS

00:55:53.216 --> 00:55:54.784
TRANSFER DECISION. THIS IS LED

00:55:54.851 --> 00:55:56.753
TO SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES IN

00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:58.354
JUDICIAL DECISION MAKING AND

00:55:58.421 --> 00:55:59.923
IT'S CONTRIBUTED TO THE PROFOUND

00:55:59.989 --> 00:56:02.258
RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES

00:56:02.325 --> 00:56:03.359
AMONG YOUTH WERE TRANSFERRED TO

00:56:03.426 --> 00:56:06.162
ADULT COURT. IT ALSO RESULTS IN

00:56:06.229 --> 00:56:07.363
YOU BEING TRANSFERRED TO ADULT

00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:09.365
COURT EVEN IF THE JUVENILE JUDGE

00:56:09.432 --> 00:56:11.735
CONCLUDES AFTER HEARING WITH

00:56:11.801 --> 00:56:13.503
PRESENTATION OF EVIDENCE BY BOTH

00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:15.505
PROSECUTION AND DEFENSE THAT THE

00:56:15.572 --> 00:56:17.440
YOUTH IS AMENABLE TO

00:56:17.507 --> 00:56:19.175
REHABILITATION IN JUVENILE COURT

00:56:19.242 --> 00:56:21.945
. AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY ONE WILL

00:56:22.011 --> 00:56:23.246
ENSURE THAT YOU TWO ARE AMENABLE

00:56:23.313 --> 00:56:25.014
TO REHABILITATION WILL REMAIN IN

00:56:25.081 --> 00:56:26.850
JUVENILE COURT. WITHOUT

00:56:26.916 --> 00:56:29.018
RESTRICTING IN ANY WAY A JUDGE'S

00:56:29.085 --> 00:56:32.088
ABILITY TO TRANSFER A YOUTH WHO

00:56:32.155 --> 00:56:33.089
IS NOT AMENABLE TO

00:56:33.156 --> 00:56:34.691
REHABILITATION. I WANT TO

00:56:34.758 --> 00:56:36.192

VERY NOBLE AND I ADMIRE YOUNG

01:21:19.874 --> 01:21:22.644
MAN. WHO CAME FORWARD AND I'M

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:25.280
VERY VERY SORRY THAT YOU HAD TO

01:21:25.347 --> 01:21:26.982
PAY- A PRICE FOR SOMETHING YOU

01:21:27.048 --> 01:21:29.317
DIDN'T DO. THAT'S COMPLETELY

01:21:29.384 --> 01:21:31.519
UNACCEPTABLE AND- IT SHOULD BE

01:21:31.586 --> 01:21:33.455
REPUDIATED IN EVERY WAY HOWEVER

01:21:33.521 --> 01:21:37.025
I ALSO THINK THAT. HAVING THEN

01:21:37.092 --> 01:21:38.693
IN THE CAPACITY OF THESE

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:40.962
INTERROGATION CIRCUMSTANCES I

01:21:41.029 --> 01:21:44.266
WILL TELL YOU THAT- IT'S REALLY

01:21:44.332 --> 01:21:45.934
IMPORTANT TO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT

01:21:46.001 --> 01:21:48.970
MANY OF. THE OFFENDERS THAT LAW

01:21:49.037 --> 01:21:51.072
ENFORCEMENT INTERVIEW ARE VERY

01:21:51.139 --> 01:21:54.142
AFRAID AND HAVE NO TRUST. A LAW

01:21:54.209 --> 01:21:56.144
ENFORCEMENT AND SO SOME OF THE

01:21:56.211 --> 01:21:58.513
TACTICS THAT ARE USED TO GET

01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:02.550
PEOPLE TO NOT BE AFRAID. OF FALL

01:22:02.617 --> 01:22:05.754
UNDER QUESTION AND I'D- I DO

01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:07.589
THINK THAT IT IS IMPROPER.

01:22:07.656 --> 01:22:09.824
PERSONALLY TO USE DECEPTION TO

01:22:09.891 --> 01:22:12.694
TRY TO GET PEOPLE EVEN TO ADMIT

01:22:12.761 --> 01:22:13.862
TO TRUTH BECAUSE I DON'T THINK

01:22:13.928 --> 01:22:15.630
THAT I DON'T THINK THE ENDS

01:22:15.697 --> 01:22:18.967
JUSTIFIES THE MEANS- IN MANY

01:22:19.034 --> 01:22:20.402
CIRCUMSTANCES BUT I DO THINK

01:22:20.468 --> 01:22:21.603
THAT THIS BILL UNFORTUNATELY

01:22:21.670 --> 01:22:23.538
GOES TOO FAR. AND MAKE SOME

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:25.940
GENERALIZATIONS THAT I THINK ARE

01:22:26.007 --> 01:22:27.342
UNREASONABLE TO THINK THAT. ALL

01:22:27.409 --> 01:22:29.511
PEOPLE DON'T HAVE A DAHLE

01:22:29.577 --> 01:22:30.712
JUDGEMENTAL THERE TWENTY SIX IS

01:22:30.779 --> 01:22:33.214
TOO. UNREASONABLE I DON'T THINK

01:22:33.281 --> 01:22:34.816
THAT'S A REASONABLE JUDGMENT I

01:22:34.883 --> 01:22:35.950
KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME STUDIES

01:22:36.017 --> 01:22:36.885
THAT SHOW THAT THERE'S SOME

01:22:36.951 --> 01:22:38.753
DEVELOPMENTAL. CIRCUMSTANCES

01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:39.821
THAT AREN'T REACHED UNTIL THAT

01:22:39.888 --> 01:22:42.457
AGE HOWEVER I DO THINK THAT THE

01:22:42.524 --> 01:22:46.361
BROAD POLICY OF NOT- RECOGNIZING

01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:48.229
PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO USE ADULT

01:22:48.296 --> 01:22:50.598
JUDGE UNTIL THEY'RE TWENTY SIX

01:22:50.665 --> 01:22:52.467
IS UNREASONABLE- AND THAT'S JUST

01:22:52.534 --> 01:22:55.470
OF. OPINION ON OF MINE BASED ON

01:22:55.537 --> 01:22:57.605
EXPERIENCE. AND- RIGHT I THINK

01:22:57.672 --> 01:22:59.274
THAT THERE ARE MANY MANY

01:22:59.341 --> 01:23:00.675
COMMENDABLE PARTS OF THIS BILL

01:23:00.742 --> 01:23:03.778
THAT- ARE. VERY SUPPORTABLE AND

01:23:03.845 --> 01:23:06.014
I DO THINK THERE'S WORK TO BE

01:23:06.081 --> 01:23:08.016
DONE. ON TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE

01:23:08.083 --> 01:23:09.851
DON'T HAVE OUTCOMES LIKE THIS

01:23:09.918 --> 01:23:11.586
POOR GENTLEMAN THAT CAME TO

01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:13.455
TESTIFY TODAY BUT THIS BILL IS

01:23:13.521 --> 01:23:16.224

01:23:16.291 --> 01:23:18.059
THE PROBLEMS APPROPRIATELY SO I

01:23:18.126 --> 01:23:19.260
WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT

01:23:19.327 --> 01:23:23.131

HIGHWAY PATROL WHO WAS VERY

01:40:47.141 --> 01:40:47.841
INTEGRAL IN TERMS OF LAYING OUT

01:40:47.908 --> 01:40:50.711
THE STRUCTURE OF HOW WITH

01:40:50.778 --> 01:40:53.714
TECHNICAL INPUT- TO THE BILL SO

CONTINUE TO HAVE. CONVERSATIONS

01:41:01.121 --> 01:41:04.558
BUT I GUESS AS I THINK ABOUT

01:41:04.625 --> 01:41:07.561
WHAT WORKS IN THE REAL WORLD-

01:41:07.628 --> 01:41:10.397
I'M DRIVING A CAR AND I SEE THE

01:41:10.464 --> 01:41:14.501
LIGHTS AND I'M NEED TO PULL OVER

01:41:14.568 --> 01:41:15.702
THE FIRST QUESTION IN MY MIND IS

01:41:15.769 --> 01:41:18.238
WHY. WHY AM I BEING PULLED OVER

01:41:18.305 --> 01:41:21.108

01:41:31.084 --> 01:41:33.153
LITTLE DIFFERENT BUT- I'M A LET

01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:35.622
THE WINDOW DOWN. AND I'M

01:41:35.689 --> 01:41:38.492
EXPECTING THE OFFICER TO TELL ME

01:41:38.559 --> 01:41:42.229
WHY. I'VE BEEN PULLED OVER.

01:41:42.296 --> 01:41:43.297
THAT'S THE FIRST THING I'M

01:41:43.363 --> 01:41:45.699
LOOKING TO HEAR. AND SO I THINK

01:41:45.766 --> 01:41:47.568
THAT WHEN WE WENT AND I THINK

01:41:47.634 --> 01:41:49.870
THAT ON ALL OF THESE EFFORTS

01:41:49.937 --> 01:41:50.537
HERE'S DESIGNED TO CONTINUE TO

01:41:50.604 --> 01:41:51.738
BUILD TRUST BUILD. A

01:41:51.805 --> 01:41:54.441
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PUBLIC

01:41:54.508 --> 01:41:55.976
BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT IS

01:41:56.043 --> 01:41:59.313
SUSTAINING. IT SORT OF TURNS THE

01:41:59.379 --> 01:42:04.051
TIDE. I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU.

01:42:04.117 --> 01:42:06.053

01:42:06.119 --> 01:42:07.754
GOLD STANDARD. JUST IN TERMS OF

01:42:07.821 --> 01:42:10.123
HOW JUST MY INTERACTION WITH

01:42:10.190 --> 01:42:13.527
THEM IN RECENT TIMES. THAT THEY

01:42:13.594 --> 01:42:14.695
PRETTY MUCH NINETY SOME ODD

01:42:14.761 --> 01:42:17.598
PERCENT. ONCE THEY HAVE THAT

01:42:17.664 --> 01:42:18.632
INITIAL ENCOUNTER THEY GIVE A

01:42:18.699 --> 01:42:20.868
WARNING. AND THE PERSON DRIVES

01:42:20.934 --> 01:42:25.138
OFF. AND SO AS I'M HEARING THEIR

01:42:25.205 --> 01:42:29.710
STORY. I'M THINKING WELL OKAY IT

01:42:29.776 --> 01:42:32.379

THERE MAY BE SOME AREAS THAT WE

01:42:52.132 --> 01:42:52.933
NEED TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.168
WERE PREPARED TO DO THAT- BUT I

01:42:55.235 --> 01:42:57.304
THINK IT'S A RIGHTEOUS BILL I

01:42:57.371 --> 01:42:59.606
THINK IT INCLUDES BECAUSE LAW

01:42:59.673 --> 01:43:01.775
ENFORCEMENT WAS WITH US. EARLY

01:43:01.842 --> 01:43:04.244
AT THE TABLE. THEIR FINGERPRINTS

01:43:04.311 --> 01:43:05.646
THEIR THOUGHTS THEIR IMPRESSIONS

01:43:05.712 --> 01:43:07.748
ARE ON THIS BILL. SO I

WAS TRAINED THAT IS THE

01:43:15.522 --> 01:43:17.658
APPROPRIATE WAY TO ADDRESS THE

THAT- THAT IS OUR STANDARD

01:43:24.197 --> 01:43:26.600
HOWEVER I DO BELIEVE THIS BILL

01:43:26.667 --> 01:43:28.402
UNFORTUNATE THIS POINT IS STILL

01:43:28.468 --> 01:43:31.071
TOO RIGID. AND I THINK IT HAS

01:43:31.138 --> 01:43:33.240
ASPECTS OF HER VERY VERY

01:43:33.307 --> 01:43:34.908

02:01:06.659 --> 02:01:10.262
ASKED. WHETHER OR NOT THEY

02:01:10.329 --> 02:01:14.400
UNDERSTOOD IT. AND MANY TIMES

02:01:14.467 --> 02:01:17.303
FELT A NEED TO MASK THEIR

02:01:17.370 --> 02:01:20.239
INABILITY TO COMPREHEND WHAT WAS

02:01:20.306 --> 02:01:24.510
HAPPENING. AND. MY HEART GOES

02:01:24.577 --> 02:01:27.847
OUT TO YOU HAVING YOU KNOW A

02:01:27.913 --> 02:01:30.282
CHILD WHO SUFFERS FROM THIS BUT

02:01:30.349 --> 02:01:34.654
I THINK THAT. THIS IS A PROBLEM

02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:37.323
THAT MEANS THAT THE NEEDS AND

02:01:37.390 --> 02:01:40.393
INTERESTS HAVE TO BE BALANCED.

02:01:40.459 --> 02:01:46.866
AND THE CURRENT LAW DOES THAT-

02:01:46.932 --> 02:01:49.235
TWENTY SEVENTEEN IS NOT NEEDED.

02:01:49.301 --> 02:01:51.837
PRIOR INCONSISTENT STATEMENTS

02:01:51.904 --> 02:01:55.875
CAN ALREADY BE ADMITTED. BY A

02:01:55.941 --> 02:01:58.277
WITNESS IF THEY HAVE SAID

02:01:58.344 --> 02:02:00.279
SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT

02:02:00.346 --> 02:02:03.349
THEY SAY IN COURT. AND THERE'S A

02:02:03.416 --> 02:02:05.985
FUNDAMENTAL REASON THAT WE DON'T

02:02:06.052 --> 02:02:08.821
ACCEPT HEARSAY IN CRIMINAL

02:02:08.888 --> 02:02:12.958
TRIALS. AND IT'S BEEN SETTLED

02:02:13.025 --> 02:02:15.327
LAW FOR AT LEAST A HUNDRED AND

02:02:15.394 --> 02:02:19.932
TWENTY YEARS. AND THE ANALYSIS.

02:02:19.999 --> 02:02:22.501
IT TALKS ABOUT AN EARLY CASE

02:02:22.568 --> 02:02:24.737
MADDOX WHICH SAID THAT IT'S

02:02:24.804 --> 02:02:28.307
FUNDAMENTAL TO BE ABLE TO ASK

02:02:28.374 --> 02:02:31.343
YOUR ACCUSER QUESTIONS TO HAVE

02:02:31.410 --> 02:02:34.547
THE JURY BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THEM

02:02:34.613 --> 02:02:36.949
AND EVALUATE THEIR DEMEANOR. AND

02:02:37.016 --> 02:02:38.284
TO MAKE DRAW THEIR OWN

02:02:38.350 --> 02:02:43.823
CONCLUSIONS. AND THAT HERE SAY.

02:02:43.889 --> 02:02:46.792
IS FUNDAMENTALLY UNRELIABLE AND

02:02:46.859 --> 02:02:50.329
CAN LEAD TO- BE THE RESULT OF

02:02:50.396 --> 02:02:52.131
SUGGESTED QUESTIONING OR

02:02:52.198 --> 02:02:55.568
INTERVIEWING AND LEAD TO A

02:02:55.634 --> 02:02:59.672
MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE. ALREADY

02:02:59.739 --> 02:03:01.907
ASK ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THEIR

02:03:01.974 --> 02:03:04.110
SPECIAL PROVISIONS AND COURT TO

02:03:04.176 --> 02:03:06.412

02:03:09.615 --> 02:03:12.118
ADVISED IN THEIR TRAINING AND BY

02:03:12.184 --> 02:03:14.120
LAW THEY MUST TAKE SPECIAL CARE

02:03:14.186 --> 02:03:14.787
TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:03:14.854 --> 02:03:16.422
DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED

02:03:16.489 --> 02:03:18.390

PROTECTED FROM UNDUE HARASSMENT

02:03:23.095 --> 02:03:25.998
OR EMBARRASSMENT. REPETITIVE

02:03:26.065 --> 02:03:28.300
UNNECESSARY QUESTIONING IS

02:03:28.367 --> 02:03:31.036
PROHIBITED. AND THE JUDGE IS

02:03:31.103 --> 02:03:32.872
SUPPOSED TO ENSURE THAT THE

02:03:32.938 --> 02:03:33.939
FORMER THE QUESTIONS ARE

02:03:34.006 --> 02:03:36.208
APPROPRIATE TO THE COGNITIVE

02:03:36.275 --> 02:03:38.577
LEVEL OF THE WITNESS. IF

02:03:38.644 --> 02:03:40.946
NECESSARY THE DA CAN APPLY FOR

02:03:41.013 --> 02:03:42.882
IN ORDER TO ADMIT THE PRIOR

02:03:42.948 --> 02:03:45.551
TESTIMONY FROM A PRELIMINARY

02:03:45.618 --> 02:03:47.787
HEARING. IF THE COURT FINDS THAT

02:03:47.853 --> 02:03:49.822
FURTHER TESTIMONY WOULD CAUSE

02:03:49.889 --> 02:03:52.124
SUCH EMOTIONAL TRAUMA OR MAKE

02:03:52.191 --> 02:03:54.126
THE VICTIM MEDICALLY UNABLE TO

SOMEONE BEING CONVICTED OF A

02:04:12.044 --> 02:04:15.514
CRIME. AND IT COULD RANGE FROM-

02:04:15.581 --> 02:04:17.950
A MISDEMEANOR TO A CRIME THAT

02:04:18.017 --> 02:04:20.386
WOULD PUT THEM AWAY FOR LIFE

02:04:20.452 --> 02:04:23.389
WITHOUT THE WITNESS EVER COMING

02:04:23.455 --> 02:04:31.330

02:47:47.290 --> 02:47:48.858
IN SHASTA COUNTY FOR THOSE AUG

02:47:48.925 --> 02:47:51.161
FIRE AND SADLY IT FOR THIS LOG

02:47:51.227 --> 02:47:52.695
FIRE THEY'RE ALSO FOR

02:47:52.762 --> 02:47:54.330
ALLEGATIONS OF INVOLUNTARY

02:47:54.397 --> 02:47:56.399
MANSLAUGHTER DUE TO P. GENIES

02:47:56.466 --> 02:47:59.202
CONTACT. SO THIS BILL SEEKS TO

02:47:59.269 --> 02:48:03.006
DETER OF. CRIMINAL CONDUCT AND

02:48:03.072 --> 02:48:04.741
IT APPLIES PENALTIES AND

02:48:04.808 --> 02:48:06.776
ENHANCES THE PENALTIES TO

02:48:06.843 --> 02:48:08.945
CRIMINALLY RECKLESS CONDUCT. SO

02:48:09.012 --> 02:48:10.980
FOR ME I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE

02:48:11.047 --> 02:48:12.449
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT THIS

02:48:12.515 --> 02:48:14.484
BILL DOES AND THE JURISDICTION

02:48:14.551 --> 02:48:15.552
OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC

02:48:15.618 --> 02:48:17.420
UTILITIES COMMISSION WHICH I'VE

02:48:17.487 --> 02:48:19.389
HAD THE HONOR OF SERVING ON. SO

02:48:19.456 --> 02:48:23.226
THE CPUC HAS NO POWER TO ENFORCE

02:48:23.293 --> 02:48:25.462
THE CRIMINAL LAW. THE CPSC

02:48:25.528 --> 02:48:27.063
ENFORCES THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC

02:48:27.130 --> 02:48:30.433
UTILITIES CODE AND ITS OWN RULES

02:48:30.500 --> 02:48:31.835

02:48:31.901 --> 02:48:33.837
CPUC DOESN'T CONDUCT CRIMINAL

02:48:33.903 --> 02:48:36.005
HEARINGS ITS JUDGES ARE NOT

02:48:36.072 --> 02:48:38.141
DESIGNED TO DO THAT IT'S

02:48:38.208 --> 02:48:38.875
EVIDENCE THAT- GATHERING IS NOT

02:48:38.942 --> 02:48:41.044
DESIGNED TO DO THAT THEY HAVE NO

02:48:41.110 --> 02:48:43.613
CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT POWER. SO

02:48:43.680 --> 02:48:46.349
THIS BILL WOULD ONLY APPLY WHERE

02:48:46.416 --> 02:48:48.151
THERE HAS BEEN A CRIMINAL

02:48:48.218 --> 02:48:50.019
INDICTMENT AND CONVICTION. SO

02:48:50.086 --> 02:48:51.621
IT'S ALSO WORTH EMPHASIZING THE

02:48:51.688 --> 02:48:53.256
DIFFERENCE IN THE STANDARDS

02:48:53.323 --> 02:48:55.558
BETWEEN CRIMINAL LAW AND AT THE

02:48:55.625 --> 02:48:56.526

FINDING OF NEGLIGENCE LET ALONE

02:49:04.300 --> 02:49:05.835
RECKLESSNESS AND NEVER

CLOSING THIS BILL IS NOT

02:49:34.664 --> 02:49:36.633
DUPLICATIVE THERE ARE DIFFERENT

UNNECESSARY. AND FINALLY WE

02:55:37.627 --> 02:55:38.628
WOULD ARGUE THAT THE BILL

03:00:19.208 --> 03:00:22.845
REMOVE ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL

03:00:22.912 --> 03:00:25.347

03:02:05.514 --> 03:02:07.149
THAT WE NEED TO MAKE IT EASIER

03:02:07.216 --> 03:02:08.817

MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT- I

03:02:12.888 --> 03:02:14.223
THINK THAT IS THE APPROACH WE

SHOULDTAKE. I HAVE BEEN ON THIS

03:02:16.292 --> 03:02:18.560

HAVE NOT VOTED FOR ANY BILLS

03:02:20.562 --> 03:02:23.032
THAT INCREASE PENALTIES. I VOTED

03:02:23.098 --> 03:02:24.266
FOR BILLS THAT WOULD MAKE IT

03:02:24.333 --> 03:02:26.869
EASIER TO CATCH THE BAD GUY TO

03:02:26.935 --> 03:02:29.605
REFORM THE BAD GUY- THAT'S MY

03:02:29.672 --> 03:02:31.507
PREFERRED APPROACH AND I'LL BE

MALCOLM- ELABORATE ON- NUMBER

03:02:48.424 --> 03:02:49.958
ONE THE COSTS FOR THINGS LIKE

03:02:50.025 --> 03:02:52.428
THIS JUST GET PASSED ALONG TO

03:02:52.494 --> 03:02:54.229

TEN FOLD SINCE THE LAST FEW

03:03:18.554 --> 03:03:23.792
YEARS- JUST DUE TO THE INCREASED

03:03:23.859 --> 03:03:25.461
COSTS FOR THE CHILES. THE BIGGER

03:03:25.527 --> 03:03:27.896
ISSUE HERE IS THE VEGETATION

03:03:27.963 --> 03:03:29.998
MANAGEMENT- THE UTILITY

03:03:30.065 --> 03:03:33.035
COMPANIES DO NOT DO NOT CREATE

03:03:33.102 --> 03:03:35.471
AN OVER VEGETATION OF CALIFORNIA

03:03:35.537 --> 03:03:37.039
ARE LAWS DO OUR ENVIRONMENTAL

03:03:37.106 --> 03:03:39.875
LAW EFFORTS DO ALL OF THOSE DO.

03:03:39.942 --> 03:03:42.411
AND FOR US TO SAY THAT THEY ARE

03:03:42.478 --> 03:03:44.980
SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR- D.

03:03:45.047 --> 03:03:47.950
IGNITION- YEAH OU KNOW THERE A

03:03:48.016 --> 03:03:48.751
LOT OF IGNITION SOURCES OUT

03:03:48.817 --> 03:03:50.119
THERE BUT WE DON'T SU MOTHER

03:03:50.185 --> 03:03:51.920
NATURE BECAUSE SHE SENDS DOWN A

03:03:51.987 --> 03:03:53.455
LIGHTNING STRIKE DURING A LIGHT

03:03:53.522 --> 03:03:55.891
DRY LIGHTNING STORM. AND A LOT

03:03:55.958 --> 03:03:57.860
OF FIRES ARE STARTED LIKE THAT.

03:03:57.926 --> 03:03:59.995
THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF ALL OF

03:04:00.062 --> 03:04:02.064
IT IS OUR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT

03:04:02.131 --> 03:04:04.700
IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN NEGLECTED

03:04:04.767 --> 03:04:06.568
FOR A HUNDRED YEARS AND WE ARE

03:04:06.635 --> 03:04:08.270
WOEFULLY INADEQUATE AND CATCHING

03:04:08.337 --> 03:04:10.172
UP WITH THAT. AND WE HAVE

03:04:10.239 --> 03:04:12.141
CREATED BARRIERS TO PEOPLE

03:04:12.207 --> 03:04:14.777
INCLUDING THE UTILITY COMPANIES

03:04:14.843 --> 03:04:16.845
TO CLEARING THEIR BRUSH. IF IT'S

03:04:16.912 --> 03:04:19.114
PRIVATELY OWNED AS IT IS STATED

03:04:19.181 --> 03:04:21.116
BEFORE I CAN'T EVEN GET SOMEBODY

03:04:21.183 --> 03:04:22.785
WHEN I WAS DOING BRUSH CLEARANCE

03:04:22.851 --> 03:04:24.686
INSPECTIONS FOR THE COUNTY I

03:04:24.753 --> 03:04:26.455
COULDN'T GO ON PRIVATE PEOPLE'S

03:04:26.522 --> 03:04:28.123
PROPERTY ADD TO GO LOOK AT. FOR

03:04:28.190 --> 03:04:29.591
IT THEIR PROPERTY FROM ANOTHER

03:04:29.658 --> 03:04:31.226
HILL AND THEN SEND THEM A NOTICE

03:04:31.293 --> 03:04:33.095
SAY HEY YOU REALLY NEED TO TRIM

03:04:33.162 --> 03:04:36.231
THIS DOWN- BUT- YOU KNOW AT THE

03:04:36.298 --> 03:04:38.467
END OF THE DAY. WE HAVE LAWS

03:04:38.534 --> 03:04:41.770
THAT PROTECT PRIVATE PROPERTY

03:04:41.837 --> 03:04:42.771
OWNERS FROM HAVING. SOMEBODY

03:04:42.838 --> 03:04:44.339
ELSE COME ONTO THEIR PROPERTY

03:04:44.406 --> 03:04:47.810
AND REMOVE BRUSH. AND SO UNTIL

03:04:47.876 --> 03:04:49.344
WE ADDRESS THE BIGGER ISSUE

03:04:49.411 --> 03:04:51.580
WHICH IS OUR VEGETATION

03:04:51.647 --> 03:04:54.082
MANAGEMENT IN CALIFORNIA AND THE

03:04:54.149 --> 03:04:55.851
REGULATIONS AND LAWS THAT

03:04:55.918 --> 03:04:57.953
PREVENT US FROM DOING A BETTER

03:04:58.020 --> 03:04:59.521
JOB AT THAT WE CAN'T PINPOINT

03:04:59.588 --> 03:05:02.958
EVERYTHING ON. ON ONE WANTED ME

03:05:03.025 --> 03:05:05.294
TO UTILITY COMPANIES OR DID

03:05:05.360 --> 03:05:07.162
MANUFACTURERS OF BRAKES ON

03:05:07.229 --> 03:05:08.664
TRUCKS THAT PULL OVER TO THE

03:05:08.730 --> 03:05:10.332
SIDE OF THE ROAD WITH HOT BREAKS

03:05:10.399 --> 03:05:12.234
AND LIGHT FIRES THAT WAY. OR

03:05:12.301 --> 03:05:13.635
MOTHER NATURE AND HER LIGHTNING

03:05:13.702 --> 03:05:16.038
STRIKES OR SOMEBODY'S IN THEIR

03:05:16.104 --> 03:05:18.040
BACKYARD WITH ELECTRIC GENERATOR

03:05:18.106 --> 03:05:20.142
OR SOMEBODY OUT DOING SOME BRUSH

03:05:20.209 --> 03:05:22.144
CLEARANCE WHO ACTUALLY HAD TO

03:05:22.211 --> 03:05:23.912
STONE WITH THEIR- BRUSH

03:05:23.979 --> 03:05:27.082
CLEARANCE MATERIAL AND CREATE TO

03:05:27.149 --> 03:05:28.984
SPARK WHICH SENDS OFF A FIRE. SO

03:05:29.051 --> 03:05:30.953
BRUSH CLEARANCE IS THE WARY WHAT

03:05:31.019 --> 03:05:33.188
HOWARD GO AND BRUSH MANAGEMENT

03:05:33.255 --> 03:05:34.756
AND- FEEL MANAGEMENT IS HOW

03:05:34.823 --> 03:05:36.825
WE'RE GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS.

03:05:36.892 --> 03:05:40.295
NOT BY CREATING MORE MECHANISMS

03:05:40.362 --> 03:05:42.064
TO OR THAT YOU HAVE COSTS THAT

03:05:42.130 --> 03:05:44.466
ARE PASSED ALONG TO WHO US THE

03:05:44.533 --> 03:05:48.937
RATEPAYERS. AND AND I JUST I

03:05:49.004 --> 03:05:51.373
THINK THERE IS ENOUGH- BOOTED OF

03:05:51.440 --> 03:05:53.408
MEASURES IN PLACE. WE'VE WE TALK

03:05:53.475 --> 03:05:55.244
OVER AND OVER ABOUT YOU KNOW

03:05:55.310 --> 03:05:57.246
THESE THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT-

03:05:57.312 --> 03:05:59.948
THEY'RE NOT EFFECTIVE. WHEN AND

03:06:00.015 --> 03:06:01.984
DOING MORE IS NOT GOING TO BE

03:06:02.050 --> 03:06:03.018
EFFECTIVE BUT THEN IN THIS SPACE

03:06:03.085 --> 03:06:05.754
WERE SAYING OH NO WE CAN DO MORE

03:06:05.821 --> 03:06:07.356
MORE IN IT SOMEHOW GOING TO BE

03:06:07.422 --> 03:06:07.956
EFFECTIVE. WHAT'S GOING TO BE

03:06:08.023 --> 03:06:09.258
EFFECTIVE IT'S GETTING A HANDLE

03:06:09.324 --> 03:06:11.159
ON OUR FUEL MANAGEMENT. AND

03:06:11.226 --> 03:06:11.793
WE'RE NOT DOING THE THINGS WE

03:06:11.860 --> 03:06:14.363
NEED TO DO. POLICY WISE AS A

03:06:14.429 --> 03:06:15.697
STATE AND AS A FEDERAL

03:06:15.764 --> 03:06:18.534
GOVERNMENT TO. TO BE ABLE TO

03:06:18.600 --> 03:06:20.602
MAKE A REAL IMPACT ON THIS WE

03:06:20.669 --> 03:06:24.072
NEED ELECTRICITY. WE'RE TRYING

03:06:24.139 --> 03:06:25.140
TO BE TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON

03:06:25.207 --> 03:06:28.110
LECTURE CITY. SO THE ONLY WAY TO

03:06:28.176 --> 03:06:30.612
LIMON EIGHT THAT IS TO ELIMINATE

03:06:30.679 --> 03:06:32.514
ELECTRICITY AND WE'RE NOT GOING

03:06:32.581 --> 03:06:39.555
TO DO THAT. SO. MEASURES

03:06:39.621 --> 03:06:41.823
PROJECTED TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE

03:06:41.890 --> 03:06:43.125
BUT THAT'S THAT'S NOT THE

03:06:43.191 --> 03:06:44.259
PROBLEM THE PROBLEM IS YOU

03:06:44.326 --> 03:06:46.562
MANAGEMENT AND THAT'S WHAT WE

03:06:46.628 --> 03:06:47.362
NEED TO FOCUS ON THANK YOU.

03:06:47.429 --> 03:06:51.166
THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS.

03:06:51.233 --> 03:06:55.837
THE BILL MISTER BRIAN I. YES WE

03:06:55.904 --> 03:06:56.972
TALK A LOT ABOUT THE FACT THAT

03:06:57.039 --> 03:06:58.774
FINES AND FEES AN ADDITIONAL

03:06:58.840 --> 03:06:59.741
PENALTIES HARD BLACK BROWN POOR

03:06:59.808 --> 03:07:02.210
INDIGENOUS PEOPLE AND WE GET A

03:07:02.277 --> 03:07:04.279
LOT OF PUSH BACK FROM THE SAME

03:07:04.346 --> 03:07:05.414
FOLKS WHO USE THAT THEN LOGIC

03:07:05.480 --> 03:07:07.616
NOT TO APPLY TO CORPORATE

03:07:07.683 --> 03:07:12.454
UTILITY ENTITIES. AND THAT'S-

03:07:12.521 --> 03:07:14.489
THAT I'M DUMBFOUNDED- BY THAT

03:07:14.556 --> 03:07:16.458
ABILITY TO APPLY THAT LOGIC IN

03:07:16.525 --> 03:07:17.993
CERTAIN CASES AND NOT APPLIED IN

03:07:18.060 --> 03:07:19.127
OTHER CASES OF COURSE THERE ARE

03:07:19.194 --> 03:07:21.763
A LOT OF THINGS WE NEED TO DO

03:07:21.830 --> 03:07:23.432
WITH BRUSH MANAGEMENT AND MAKING

03:07:23.498 --> 03:07:25.233
SURE- THAT FIRES AREN'T STARTED

03:07:25.300 --> 03:07:26.168
IN THAT WE CAN STILL HAVE

03:07:26.234 --> 03:07:28.403
SUCCESSFUL UTILITIES THAT DON'T

03:07:28.470 --> 03:07:30.238
INCREASE THE RATES ON

03:07:30.305 --> 03:07:33.108
INDIVIDUALS- ALL OF THAT IS

03:07:33.175 --> 03:07:34.376
IMPORTANT BUT I DON'T SEE THAT

03:07:34.443 --> 03:07:36.511
THIS BILL IS IN VIOLATION OF

03:07:36.578 --> 03:07:39.047
THAT- GIVEN THAT IT ONLY. ADDS

03:07:39.114 --> 03:07:40.449
ARE AUTHORIZES THIS FINE IF

03:07:40.515 --> 03:07:41.850
CONVICTED OF A MISDEMEANOR OR

03:07:41.917 --> 03:07:44.152
FELONY VIOLATION FOR STARTING A

03:07:44.219 --> 03:07:48.957
FIRE. WHICH IS A- WILDLY COMMON

03:07:49.024 --> 03:07:49.758
OCCURRENCE AND FAR TOO COMMON

03:07:49.825 --> 03:07:51.760
OCCURS AND SO I WILL BE

03:07:51.827 --> 03:07:53.729
SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND I WANT

03:07:53.795 --> 03:07:56.498
TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING

03:07:56.565 --> 03:07:59.001
. THANK YOU IN YOUR WAY CLOSE.

03:07:59.067 --> 03:08:01.303
THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS

03:08:01.370 --> 03:08:03.972
FOR THE DISCUSSION- I LIVE IN P.

03:08:04.039 --> 03:08:05.073
JEANNIE TERRITORY ON THE

03:08:05.140 --> 03:08:06.875
WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE. I

03:08:06.942 --> 03:08:08.543
DON'T SLEEP WHEN IT'S WINDY I

03:08:08.610 --> 03:08:10.679
SET UP WAITING. BECAUSE I KNOW

03:08:10.746 --> 03:08:12.547
THAT I'M AT RISK BECAUSE OF THE

03:08:12.614 --> 03:08:14.983
FAILURE TO MAINTAIN THESE LINES

03:08:15.050 --> 03:08:16.585
TO DO THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT.

03:08:16.652 --> 03:08:18.053
AND YES OUR UTILITY RATES ARE

03:08:18.120 --> 03:08:20.222
TOO HIGH THERE TOO HIGH BECAUSE

03:08:20.288 --> 03:08:21.256
FOR TOO LONG UTILITIES BEEN

03:08:21.323 --> 03:08:23.692
PUTTING INVESTORS FIRST. AND NOT

03:08:23.759 --> 03:08:26.128
OUR STATE. AND ENOUGH IS ENOUGH

03:08:26.194 --> 03:08:27.663
WE DIDN'T NEED AN AUDIT THE

03:08:27.729 --> 03:08:29.831
AUDIT THE CAME OUT LAST WEEK TO

03:08:29.898 --> 03:08:30.899
TELL US THE WCT ISN'T DOING

03:08:30.966 --> 03:08:32.167
THEIR JOB. TO HOLD UTILITIES

03:08:32.234 --> 03:08:33.869
ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE WE SEE IT

03:08:33.935 --> 03:08:35.170
WHEN OUR STATE BURNS EVERY

03:08:35.237 --> 03:08:37.472
SINGLE YEAR AT THE HANDS OF

03:08:37.539 --> 03:08:39.741
UTILITIES. BUT NOW WE HAVE THE

03:08:39.808 --> 03:08:41.576
AUDIT TO TELL US WHAT WE ALREADY

03:08:41.643 --> 03:08:43.578
KNEW. AND SO IT IS INCUMBENT

03:08:43.645 --> 03:08:44.946
UPON US. TO DO WHAT IT TAKES TO

03:08:45.013 --> 03:08:46.848
KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. SAFE

03:08:46.915 --> 03:08:48.383
FROM THE THREATS TODAY WHEN THE

03:08:48.450 --> 03:08:52.087
WIND BLOWS AND THEIR FAILURE

03:08:52.154 --> 03:08:53.255
STARTS A FIRE IN COMMUNITIES

03:08:53.321 --> 03:08:54.923
LIKE MINE. AND FROM THE FUTURE.

03:08:54.990 --> 03:08:56.792
BECAUSE YES THIS IS ONE OF THE

03:08:56.858 --> 03:08:58.460
LARGEST CONTRIBUTORS TO CLIMATE

03:08:58.527 --> 03:09:00.862
CHANGE RIGHT NOW. SO FOR NOW AND

03:09:00.929 --> 03:09:02.864
MY KIDS FUTURE WE NEED BE

03:09:02.931 --> 03:09:04.366
DOUBLING DOWN IN MAKING SURE

03:09:04.433 --> 03:09:05.834
THAT EVERY SINGLE FORM IN THIS

03:09:05.901 --> 03:09:08.904
STATE HAS THE ABILITY TO HOLD.

03:09:08.970 --> 03:09:09.905
THESE COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE AND

03:09:09.971 --> 03:09:12.274
YOU KNOW WHAT. WE THINK THIS A

03:09:12.340 --> 03:09:14.209
LOT IN THIS COMMITTEE I USED TO

03:09:14.276 --> 03:09:15.744
SIT ON THIS COMMITTEE. IF YOU'RE

03:09:15.811 --> 03:09:17.412
NOT DOING ANYTHING WRONG YOU'VE

03:09:17.479 --> 03:09:18.613
GOT NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. GO

03:09:18.680 --> 03:09:21.216
DO YOUR JOB. AND THEN THESE

03:09:21.283 --> 03:09:23.051
FINES WILL NEVER COME TO PASS.

03:09:43.238 --> 03:09:46.007
NEEDED TO CLEAR. AND I REMEMBER

03:09:46.074 --> 03:09:49.277
ACTUARIAL. GOING THROUGH A

03:09:49.344 --> 03:09:53.515
SCENARIO OF. WHAT WOULD IT COST

03:09:53.582 --> 03:09:56.118
FOR A LAWSUIT VERSUS. DURING THE

03:09:56.184 --> 03:09:58.520
ACTUAL CLEANUP IN MANAGING THE

03:09:58.587 --> 03:10:01.389
VEGETATION AND READ WOULD HAVE

03:10:01.456 --> 03:10:03.258
LAWYERS AN ACTUARIAL SAY IT'S

03:10:03.325 --> 03:10:06.128
CHEAPER TO JUST NOT DO ANYTHING

03:10:06.194 --> 03:10:08.797
AT TAKE THE LAWSUIT. THEN BUT

THAT IS SOMETHING WE NEEDED TO

03:10:22.310 --> 03:10:25.147

03:10:25.213 --> 03:10:28.283

BE A PRIORITY NOT ONLY FOR

03:10:34.923 --> 03:10:36.792
UTILITIES COMPANIES. BUT IT

03:10:36.858 --> 03:10:40.295
SHOULD BE A PRIORITY FOR US AND

03:10:40.362 --> 03:10:42.397

03:11:40.555 --> 03:11:42.757
INSTEAD OF JUST SAYING IT'S NOT

03:11:42.824 --> 03:11:45.293

ALTERNATIVE TO INCARCERATION BUT

03:19:27.188 --> 03:19:27.922
JUST ANOTHER FORM OF

03:19:27.989 --> 03:19:29.757
INCARCERATION. INSTEAD OF BEING

03:19:29.824 --> 03:19:31.859

THAT THEY ARE PLACED ON YOUNG

SUPPOSED TO BE NINETY DAYS AND

03:19:55.883 --> 03:19:59.387
IT TURNS INTO A YEAR- I THINK

03:19:59.454 --> 03:20:02.824
IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT

03:20:02.890 --> 03:20:06.494

03:20:21.876 --> 03:20:23.344

03:20:25.780 --> 03:20:27.815
PEOPLE THAT ARE ON HIM P. ARE

LIKE KIDS AND GIVE THEM

03:20:46.000 --> 03:20:47.668

03:20:47.735 --> 03:20:49.003
ALSO IMPORTANT TO GIVE YOUNG

05:15:32.647 --> 05:15:35.516
VICTIMHOOD I GET A FEELING TO

05:15:35.583 --> 05:15:37.785
THAT AS YOU DESCRIBED THE NEED

05:15:37.852 --> 05:15:39.520
FOR THIS BILL THAT IT'S- THE

05:15:39.587 --> 05:15:41.856
ANTI LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND I

05:15:41.922 --> 05:15:43.057
THINK WE NEED TO BUILD THAT

05:15:43.124 --> 05:15:45.626
TRUST NOT A ROAD AND THIS SEEMS

05:15:45.693 --> 05:15:47.094
LIKE IT'S- MOVING INTHE WRONG

05:15:47.161 --> 05:15:49.163
DIRECTION SO I WON'T BE ABLE TO

THE COMMENTS I CAN'T TELL YOU

05:15:57.104 --> 05:15:57.905
HOW MANY VICTIMS OF TRAUMA AND

05:15:57.972 --> 05:16:00.608
VIOLENCE- I'VE COME ACROSS WHO

05:16:00.675 --> 05:16:02.310
WERE UNABLE TO RECEIVE SERVICES

05:16:02.376 --> 05:16:11.752
ARE. AS A TOOL OF LEVERAGE FOR

05:16:11.819 --> 05:16:14.722
PROSECUTORS TO GET CONVICTIONS

05:16:14.789 --> 05:16:16.157
IS HARMFUL TO VICTIMS. AND I

05:16:16.223 --> 05:16:18.092
THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR US TO

05:16:18.159 --> 05:16:19.160
EXPAND THE DEFINITION OF VICTIM

05:16:19.226 --> 05:16:20.328
TO ANYBODY WHO'S HARMED BY

05:16:20.394 --> 05:16:24.532
VIOLENCE OR TRAUMA- THE IDEA

05:16:24.598 --> 05:16:25.800
THAT THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION

05:16:25.866 --> 05:16:27.001
FUND- MAYBE BECOMING INSOLVENT

05:16:27.068 --> 05:16:28.269
MIGHT BE A QUESTION ABOUT A

05:16:34.408 --> 05:16:36.610
PROGRAM I THINK IT'S SMART IT'S

05:16:36.677 --> 05:16:38.145
REASONABLE- IT ADDRESSES A MAJOR

05:16:38.212 --> 05:16:40.614
CONCERN THAT PEOPLE HAVE WHEN

05:16:40.681 --> 05:16:42.717

PENALTY IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S NOT

05:19:17.505 --> 05:19:18.939

DEEPLY. ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT

ARE AGAINST THE VIOLENCE OR THE

05:50:59.037 --> 05:51:00.272
VIOLENT ACTIONS WITH A GUN

05:51:00.339 --> 05:51:01.807
ESPECIALLY THE TRAGIC

05:51:01.874 --> 05:51:03.709
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT. ABOUT US

05:51:03.776 --> 05:51:06.178
AWARE OF THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE

05:51:06.245 --> 05:51:08.080
NOT MANAGING VERY WELL. BUT I

05:51:08.147 --> 05:51:10.149
WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THAT ARE

05:51:10.215 --> 05:51:11.583
APPETITE NEEDS TO BE MORE

05:51:11.650 --> 05:51:14.019
FOCUSED. TOWARDS THE BEHAVIOR

05:51:14.086 --> 05:51:16.488
WITH THAT WEAPON ARE NOT THE

05:51:16.555 --> 05:51:19.458
WEAPON ITSELF- I FIND IT.

05:51:19.525 --> 05:51:22.060
ALARMING THAT WE ARE SO FOCUSED

05:51:22.127 --> 05:51:24.797
ON CREATING MORE AND MORE

05:51:24.863 --> 05:51:27.032
PARAMETERS FOR LEGAL PURCHASERS

05:51:27.099 --> 05:51:28.867
THOSE ARE NOT THE PEOPLE THAT

05:51:28.934 --> 05:51:30.669
ARE ENGAGING IN THESE VIOLENT

05:51:30.736 --> 05:51:35.140
ACTS AND- I CLEARLY PREVENTION

05:51:35.207 --> 05:51:37.075
OF PRECAUTIONS ARE. SOMETHING WE

05:51:37.142 --> 05:51:38.744
ALL SUPPORT BUT I THINK THAT

05:51:38.811 --> 05:51:41.113
THIS BILL PROVIDES A VERY

05:51:41.180 --> 05:51:42.781
ARBITRARY AND UNNECESSARY

05:51:42.848 --> 05:51:45.017
ACTIONS FOR EXAMPLE. I'M

05:51:45.083 --> 05:51:46.819
CONFUSED WHY THE LANGUAGE

05:51:46.885 --> 05:51:49.421
DOESN'T SAY AT LEAST ONE HALF.

05:51:49.488 --> 05:51:52.124
BUT IT SAYS LITERALLY ONE HALF.

05:51:52.191 --> 05:51:54.993
SO I THINK THAT THAT'S MAYBE A

05:51:55.060 --> 05:51:56.895
MINOR THING BUT SOMETHING YOU

05:51:56.962 --> 05:51:58.096
SHOULD PROBABLY CONSIDER-

05:51:58.163 --> 05:52:01.733
AMENDING- BUT THIS POINT I'M NOT

05:52:01.800 --> 05:52:03.669
IN A POSITION TO SUPPORT THE

05:52:03.735 --> 05:52:04.903
BILL BECAUSE I THINK IT HAS THE-

05:52:04.970 --> 05:52:06.472
THE PROPER FOCUS OF THIS IS

05:52:06.538 --> 05:52:10.108
TRUE- ARBITER. THANK YOU ANYMORE
