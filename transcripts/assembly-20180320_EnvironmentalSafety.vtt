IN RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE

00:30:22.921 --> 00:30:27.793 region:rollup2

OR REQUESTED FROM EPA ON AND.

00:30:36.068 --> 00:30:40.505 region:rollup2
SO THIS BILL DOESN'T

00:30:38.804 --> 00:30:42.307 region:rollup2
DRASTICALLY CHANGED THE AMOUNT

00:30:40.505 --> 00:30:44.142 region:rollup2
OF INSPECTIONS THAT WOULD BE

00:30:42.307 --> 00:30:47.679 region:rollup2
REQUIRED BUT DOES SAID IN

00:31:03.128 --> 00:31:04.529 region:rollup2
TO BE A A CODIFICATION OF

00:31:03.929 --> 00:31:04.963 region:rollup2
INSPECTION RECORDS AND MAKING

00:31:04.529 --> 00:31:05.597 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THERE IS A

00:31:04.963 --> 00:31:06.732 region:rollup2
STANDARDIZED PROCESS ESPECIALLY

00:31:05.597 --> 00:31:08.700 region:rollup2
SINCE OF PERMITTING DECISIONS

00:31:06.732 --> 00:31:09.935 region:rollup2
ARE BASED IN PART ON COMPLIANCE

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:11.002 region:rollup2
HISTORY. AND LOOKING AT PAST

00:31:09.935 --> 00:31:13.171 region:rollup2
VIOLATIONS

00:31:11.002 --> 00:31:14.740 region:rollup2
WITHOUT A CONSISTENT SCHEDULE OF

00:31:13.171 --> 00:31:16.608 region:rollup2
INSPECTIONS ACROSS ALL THE

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:18.510 region:rollup2
FACILITIES ON IT WOULD BE VERY

00:31:16.608 --> 00:31:19.745 region:rollup2
HARD TO HAVE A FAIR MEASURING

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:21.380 region:rollup2
STICK UPON WHICH TO ASSESS

00:31:19.745 --> 00:31:23.582 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE HISTORY.

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:26.418 region:rollup2
ON I JUST ALSO WANT TO NOTE THE

00:31:23.582 --> 00:31:28.820 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF INSPECTIONS ON ONE

00:31:26.418 --> 00:31:30.222 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:32.057 region:rollup2
FACILITIES ARE COMPLIANT NIKITA

00:31:30.222 --> 00:31:34.226 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES I'M AND IF THEY'RE

00:31:32.057 --> 00:31:36.428 region:rollup2
NOT COMPLIANT SO THAT WE CAN

00:31:34.226 --> 00:31:38.730 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THERE IS A SPEEDY. ON

00:31:36.428 --> 00:31:39.931 region:rollup2
AND FULL A RETURN TO COMPLIANCE

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:41.600 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE'RE NOT FACED WITH

00:31:39.931 --> 00:31:42.134 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE MORE EGREGIOUS

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.535 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT WE'VE SEEN IN

00:31:42.134 --> 00:31:44.035 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA

00:31:43.535 --> 00:31:46.271 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHEN THERE ARE

00:31:44.035 --> 00:31:46.972 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS. BUT ISSUES AT THESE

00:31:46.271 --> 00:31:48.974 region:rollup2
FACILITIES AND THEY'RE NOT

00:31:46.972 --> 00:31:50.509 region:rollup2

00:31:48.974 --> 00:31:52.277 region:rollup2
REAL IMPACTS AND VERY REAL

00:31:50.509 --> 00:31:53.578 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC HARM TO THE TO THE

DECREASED THAT MUCH BUT AS MUCH

00:39:26.898 --> 00:39:30.635 region:rollup2

SIDES TO TRY TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT

FOR THE COMMUNITY. BUT I THINK

00:46:54.478 --> 00:46:57.114 region:rollup2
IF WE DON'T TAKE.

00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:58.616 region:rollup2

00:57:04.554 --> 00:57:08.125 region:rollup2
HAS ITS MATERIAL VIOLATIONS

00:57:06.256 --> 00:57:09.693 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE WANNA.

00:57:08.125 --> 00:57:11.862 region:rollup2
HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO

00:57:09.693 --> 00:57:13.764 region:rollup2
THESE CASES.

00:57:11.862 --> 00:57:14.698 region:rollup2
AND ONE YEARS IS IS NOT

00:57:13.764 --> 00:57:16.667 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT TO DO THESE TYPES OF

00:57:14.698 --> 00:57:17.934 region:rollup2
CASES.

00:57:16.667 --> 00:57:18.969 region:rollup2
SO FOR THOSE REASONS.

00:57:17.934 --> 00:57:19.937 region:rollup2
.

00:57:18.969 --> 00:57:22.072 region:rollup2
WE'D ASK THAT.

ENVIRONMENT.

01:00:12.642 --> 01:00:16.680 region:rollup2
THE INTENT IS TO HAVE DECISIONS

01:00:14.644 --> 01:00:19.282 region:rollup2
MADE ABOUT REGULATING WATER

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:20.684 region:rollup2
QUALITY ON ROBUST SCIENCE.

01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:22.119 region:rollup2
NOT MAJORITY VOTES TO THE

LEGISLATURE.

01:00:22.119 --> 01:00:26.723 region:rollup2
.

01:00:23.987 --> 01:00:28.525 region:rollup2
AGAIN EVEN I AS A SCIENTIST

01:00:26.723 --> 01:00:30.927 region:rollup2
DON'T WISH TO BE AN AUTHORITY IN

01:00:28.525 --> 01:00:32.729 region:rollup2
THIS AREA WE REALLY WANT THE

01:00:30.927 --> 01:00:34.197 region:rollup2
SCIENCE DONE BY PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:00:32.729 --> 01:00:35.799 region:rollup2
DEDICATED TO IT. AND HAVE THE

01:00:34.197 --> 01:00:37.367 region:rollup2
TIME.

01:00:35.799 --> 01:00:38.835 region:rollup2
NOW THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS

01:00:37.367 --> 01:00:40.203 region:rollup2
OF CHEMICALS IN COMMERCE TODAY

01:00:38.835 --> 01:00:41.738 region:rollup2
THE CONSUMERS USE IN AND AROUND

01:00:40.203 --> 01:00:43.206 region:rollup2
THEIR HOMES.

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:45.475 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE

01:00:43.206 --> 01:00:47.744 region:rollup2
RELEASED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT.

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:49.212 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY ONLY A HANDFUL OF

01:00:47.744 --> 01:00:52.349 region:rollup2
THE CHEMICALS ENTERING OUR WATER

01:00:49.212 --> 01:00:52.916 region:rollup2
HAVE NUMERIC WATER QUALITY

01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:54.017 region:rollup2
STANDARDS IN WHICH THE STATE

01:00:52.916 --> 01:00:57.020 region:rollup2
CAN.

01:00:54.017 --> 01:00:57.921 region:rollup2
REGULATE FOR WHICH OUR PUBLIC US

01:00:57.020 --> 01:01:00.423 region:rollup2
WATER SYSTEMS

01:00:57.921 --> 01:01:02.826 region:rollup2
SHOULD MONITOR.

01:01:00.423 --> 01:01:04.895 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS EMERGING CONCERN

01:01:02.826 --> 01:01:06.563 region:rollup2
REPRESENTS A CHALLENGING PROBLEM

01:01:04.895 --> 01:01:07.864 region:rollup2
FOR REGULATORS TO ADDRESS.

01:01:06.563 --> 01:01:09.199 region:rollup2
OWING TO LIMITED SCIENTIFIC

01:01:07.864 --> 01:01:11.201 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THEIR SOURCES

01:01:09.199 --> 01:01:13.003 region:rollup2
FATES IN THE FAX.

01:01:11.201 --> 01:01:15.305 region:rollup2
AB TWENTY SEVENTY TWO WILL

01:01:13.003 --> 01:01:17.574 region:rollup2
REQUIRE THE STATE WATER BOARD

01:01:15.305 --> 01:01:19.009 region:rollup2
THE EXTENT FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE.

01:01:17.574 --> 01:01:20.710 region:rollup2
TO MAKE RESEARCH ON.

AT.

01:01:22.212 --> 01:01:25.282 region:rollup2
WHICH WILL ENABLE THE STATE TO

01:01:23.813 --> 01:01:27.184 region:rollup2
GET AHEAD OF THE CURVE ON

01:01:25.282 --> 01:01:29.719 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL WATER CONTAMINANTS AND

01:01:27.184 --> 01:01:31.321 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE SCIENCE.

01:01:29.719 --> 01:01:33.023 region:rollup2
SOME POLISH QUESTIONS IT BROUGHT

01:01:31.321 --> 01:01:34.324 region:rollup2
TO MY ATTENTION ABOUT THE SCOPE

01:01:33.023 --> 01:01:36.226 region:rollup2
OF WHAT THE CONSTITUENTS MIGHT

01:01:34.324 --> 01:01:37.928 region:rollup2
INCLUDE.

01:01:36.226 --> 01:01:39.162 region:rollup2

IDENTIFICATION IN.

01:01:39.162 --> 01:01:45.335 region:rollup2
IS.

01:01:39.329 --> 01:01:46.836 region:rollup2
.

01:01:45.335 --> 01:01:49.906 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE M. PACKED

01:01:46.836 --> 01:01:51.775 region:rollup2
ON M. ON FUTURE REGULATIONS IN

01:01:49.906 --> 01:01:52.375 region:rollup2
COORDINATION WITH THE EXISTING.

AND HAPPY TO WORK WITH STATE

01:01:57.881 --> 01:02:01.418 region:rollup2
HOLES ON CLARIFYING THESE POLICY

01:01:59.749 --> 01:02:04.688 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

01:02:01.418 --> 01:02:06.656 region:rollup2
WITH ME TODAY IS.

01:02:04.688 --> 01:02:07.023 region:rollup2
ADRIA VENTURA FROM CLEAN WATER

01:02:06.656 --> 01:02:08.391 region:rollup2
ACTION AND BOB.

01:02:07.023 --> 01:02:09.893 region:rollup2
.

01:02:08.391 --> 01:02:12.596 region:rollup2
BOCOCK

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:14.998 region:rollup2
WITH THE AARON.

01:02:12.596 --> 01:02:16.199 region:rollup2
BROCKOVICH FOUNDATION.

01:02:14.998 --> 01:02:18.501 region:rollup2
OF WHICH WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO

01:02:16.199 --> 01:02:20.537 region:rollup2
FIRST.

01:02:18.501 --> 01:02:22.105 region:rollup2
AT AT ALL RIGHT ANDREA PLEASE GO

01:02:20.537 --> 01:02:23.240 region:rollup2
AHEAD AYE ANDREA VENTURE WITH

01:02:22.105 --> 01:02:25.809 region:rollup2
CLEAN WATER ACTION.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:27.177 region:rollup2
AND I SPEND A LOT OF MY CAREER

01:02:25.809 --> 01:02:28.745 region:rollup2
WORKING ON DRINKING WATER

01:02:27.177 --> 01:02:30.347 region:rollup2
STANDARDS AS WELL AS.

01:02:28.745 --> 01:02:32.148 region:rollup2
CONTAMINANTS OF EMERGING

01:02:30.347 --> 01:02:33.984 region:rollup2
CONCERN. AND I'LL JUST MAKE TWO

01:02:32.148 --> 01:02:35.585 region:rollup2
POINTS ARE VERY QUICKLY WE DO

01:02:33.984 --> 01:02:37.254 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THIS IS THE DIRECTION WE

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:38.922 region:rollup2
NEED TO GO AND THE REALITY IS

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:40.357 region:rollup2
THESE CHEMICALS ARE OUT THERE.

01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:42.125 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO GET A GRASP ON THAT

01:02:40.357 --> 01:02:43.793 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO PROTECT

01:02:42.125 --> 01:02:46.863 region:rollup2
A CALIFORNIA'S DRINKING WATER.

01:02:43.793 --> 01:02:48.732 region:rollup2
UP THAT SAID I ALSO WOULD. OF

01:02:46.863 --> 01:02:50.934 region:rollup2
MAKE MENTION THAT THE MORE DATA

01:02:48.732 --> 01:02:52.469 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THE BETTER AND EVEN MORE

01:02:50.934 --> 01:02:53.570 region:rollup2
COST EFFECTIVE DECISIONS WE'RE

01:02:52.469 --> 01:02:54.504 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE DOWN

01:02:53.570 --> 01:02:55.505 region:rollup2
THE ROAD IN PROTECTING THE

01:02:54.504 --> 01:02:57.607 region:rollup2
PUBLIC.

01:02:55.505 --> 01:02:59.209 region:rollup2
THAT MEANS MAY BE POLLUTION

01:02:57.607 --> 01:03:01.244 region:rollup2
PREVENTION BY UNDERSTANDING THE

01:02:59.209 --> 01:03:02.646 region:rollup2
SOURCES THAT MEANS REALLY HAVE A

01:03:01.244 --> 01:03:04.748 region:rollup2
GOOD UNDERSTAND WHAT TREATMENT

01:03:02.646 --> 01:03:06.116 region:rollup2
REALLY IS NECESSARY. ARM AND SO

01:03:04.748 --> 01:03:07.350 region:rollup2
WE DON'T OVER DO IT BUT WE ARE

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:08.618 region:rollup2
PROTECTIVE.

01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:10.253 region:rollup2
I ALSO WANT TO ADDRESS ONE OTHER

01:03:08.618 --> 01:03:13.156 region:rollup2
ISSUE I HAVE HEARD IN THE

01:03:10.253 --> 01:03:14.691 region:rollup2
BUILDING THAT THERE IS A LITTLE

01:03:13.156 --> 01:03:16.793 region:rollup2
BIT PUSHED BACK BECAUSE THE

01:03:14.691 --> 01:03:18.628 region:rollup2
RECYCLED WATER PROGRAM. HAS.

01:03:16.793 --> 01:03:20.163 region:rollup2
SOME INTEREST IN ALREADY

01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:22.032 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT ATTACHMENTS OF

01:03:20.163 --> 01:03:22.799 region:rollup2
EMERGING CONCERN KEEP IN MIND

01:03:22.032 --> 01:03:24.768 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:26.970 region:rollup2
RECYCLED WATER FOR POTABLE

01:03:24.768 --> 01:03:29.773 region:rollup2
REVIEWS. WE ARE LOOKING AT WASTE

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:31.541 region:rollup2
WATER THAT IS ONLY ONE SOURCE OF

01:03:29.773 --> 01:03:34.044 region:rollup2
CONTAMINATION IN OUR WATER. A

01:03:31.541 --> 01:03:35.478 region:rollup2
STORM WATER PRODUCTS ENDING UP

01:03:34.044 --> 01:03:37.547 region:rollup2
IN OUR WATER AND LEACHING

01:03:35.478 --> 01:03:39.616 region:rollup2
CHEMICALS ARE ALSO PROBLEMS AND

01:03:37.547 --> 01:03:40.617 region:rollup2
I WOULD ARGUE THAT PERHAPS THE

01:03:39.616 --> 01:03:41.851 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS.

01:03:40.617 --> 01:03:43.753 region:rollup2
AND THE CONCENTRATIONS MAY

01:03:41.851 --> 01:03:45.155 region:rollup2
DIFFER DEPENDING ON THE SOURCE

THEMSELVES MAKE A MYRIAD OF

OTHER CHEMICALS THAT ARE

01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:09.072 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES MORE TOXIC AND WE

01:05:07.537 --> 01:05:12.542 region:rollup2
HAVE A TENDENCY NOT TO STUDY

01:05:09.072 --> 01:05:14.477 region:rollup2

WHAT WE'RE FINDING NOW IS WHEN

THESE

01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:00.656 region:rollup2
DECISIONS HAVE TO BE MADE AT THE

01:10:58.955 --> 01:11:01.724 region:rollup2
RETAIL LEVEL?

01:11:00.656 --> 01:11:03.192 region:rollup2

AND THERE IS THE EXPERTISE AT

01:11:05.161 --> 01:11:08.231 region:rollup2
THE REVERSE DISTRIBUTOR A

AND THEN DETERMINES CAN THEY BE

01:11:16.706 --> 01:11:21.778 region:rollup2
REUSED CAN THEY BE GIVEN AWAY OR

01:11:19.775 --> 01:11:23.679 region:rollup2
ARE THEY SOME SORT OF WASTE AND

01:11:21.778 --> 01:11:25.748 region:rollup2
HOW WHAT KIND OF WASTE.

01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:27.350 region:rollup2
HAZARDOUS OR.

01:11:25.748 --> 01:11:29.118 region:rollup2
CAN IT GOING TO LANDFILLS AND

01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:31.187 region:rollup2
THAT'S SIMPLY NOT THE DECISION

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:32.989 region:rollup2
THAT IN THE RETAIL AND THEY HAVE

01:11:31.187 --> 01:11:35.291 region:rollup2

01:11:32.989 --> 01:11:39.495 region:rollup2
PRIMARY REASON FOR THE BILL.

01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:41.931 region:rollup2
.

01:11:39.495 --> 01:11:43.499 region:rollup2
BR I'M.

01:11:41.931 --> 01:11:45.268 region:rollup2
SHOW DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY WITH

01:11:43.499 --> 01:11:47.637 region:rollup2
IN THE RETAIL INDUSTRY AS TO

01:11:45.268 --> 01:11:49.639 region:rollup2
WHEN A PRODUCT BECOMES A WASTE.

01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:51.307 region:rollup2
OF RETAILERS AND MANUFACTURERS

01:11:49.639 --> 01:11:52.875 region:rollup2
HAVE DECIDED TO AVOID THE RISK

01:11:51.307 --> 01:11:54.177 region:rollup2
OF ENFORCEMENT ACTION.

01:11:52.875 --> 01:11:55.478 region:rollup2
BY ESTABLISHING VERY

01:11:54.177 --> 01:11:57.113 region:rollup2
CONSERVATIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT

01:11:55.478 --> 01:11:59.048 region:rollup2
PRACTICES

01:11:57.113 --> 01:12:00.449 region:rollup2
SO THEY WILL OFTEN THROW THINGS

01:11:59.048 --> 01:12:01.717 region:rollup2
OUT OR DECLARE THEM HAVE REDUCE

01:12:00.449 --> 01:12:03.553 region:rollup2
WASTE WHEN THEY'RE ACTUALLY

01:12:01.717 --> 01:12:05.154 region:rollup2
EITHER REUSABLE OR THEY'RE NOT

01:12:03.553 --> 01:12:06.956 region:rollup2
HAZARDOUS WASTE.

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:08.257 region:rollup2
.

01:12:06.956 --> 01:12:10.092 region:rollup2
THE RESULT IS THAT PRODUCTS

01:12:08.257 --> 01:12:11.460 region:rollup2
COULD OTHER BUYS THE DONATOR

01:12:10.092 --> 01:12:13.262 region:rollup2
SALVAGED OR NOT.

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:15.331 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX

01:12:13.262 --> 01:12:16.699 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WHEN THAT IS FAKE VEXED

01:12:15.331 --> 01:12:17.567 region:rollup2

IT USES ITS MATERIALS? NOT

01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:53.903 region:rollup2
DESIGNATING THINGS IS HAZARDOUS

01:12:52.301 --> 01:12:55.404 region:rollup2
