A GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SAID TODAY I'M PRESENTING ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN OH FOR A BILL THAT IDENTIFIES REFORMS- REFORM PROCESSES THAT HINDER UPWARD OBILITY FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THE CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM. THIS BILL IS IDENTICAL TO AB ONE OH FIVE FROM LAST YEAR WHICH THIS COMMITTEE SUPPORTED. MEMBERS AS YOU MAY RECALL THE GENESIS OF THIS BILL IS A CONSEQUENCE OF A SERIES OF LETTERS WRITTEN AND PUBLISHED IN THE SACRAMENTO BEE LAST YEAR ON BEHALF OF AFRICAN AMERICAN. EMPLOYEES WORKING AT ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. AND OUR CRAWL FOR YOUR PRISON SYSTEM. AND THE OFFICE OF STATE PUBLISHING. THE COMMON THEME OF ALL OF THESE STORIES IS THAT THERE'S A LACK OF UPWARD MOBILITY INCLUSION IN OUR CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM. AND TWENTY TWENTY THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY SUPPORTED AND GOVERNOR NEWSOM SIGNED MY BILL AB NINE SEVENTY NINE WHICH REQUIRES EACH PUBLICLY HELD CORPORATION WHOSE PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. OFFICES ARE LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA TO HAVE MINIMUM NUMBER OF DIRECTORS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES ON ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THIS IS A PRAISE WORTHY STEP FOR EMPLOYEES IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. HOWEVER THERE ARE PERPETUAL BARRIERS TO UPWARD MOBILITY THAT EXISTS IN OUR PUBLIC SECTOR CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM. IT IS IN THIS SPIRIT THAT I PUT FORWARD A NUMBER OF CIVIL SERVICE REFORMS THAT ARE REFLECTED IN AB SIXTEEN OH FOUR. FOR STARTERS AB SIXTEEN OH FOUR CALLS FOR DIVERSITY ON ALL STATE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS THAT HAVE VOLUNTEERS. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL REQUIRES THAT THE STATE PERSONNEL BOARD ESTABLISH A PROCESS THAT INCLUDES DIVERSITY AND BEST PRACTICES IN EACH ASPECT OF DESIGN. THAT ANNOUNCEMENTS AND ADMINISTRATION OF EXAMINATIONS FOR THIS TABLETS MEANT OF EMPLOYMENT LISTS. AB SIXTEEN OH FOUR PROVIDES THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES MAY UNDERSCORE MAY DEVELOP MODEL UPWARD MOBILITY GOALS TO INCLUDE RACE GENDER AND LBGT Q. AS FACTORS TO EXTENT PERMISSIBLE. UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL EQUAL PROTECTION LAWS THIS BILL REQUIRES THAT CAL HR SUBMIT WITHIN ITS ANNUAL WORKFORCE ANALYSIS AND CENSUS REPORTS ALL OF THE ADVERSE ACTIONS TAKEN BY DEPARTMENTS AGAINST EMPLOYEES. IT CALLS FOR THE REPORT TO INCLUDE THE TYPE OF ADVERSE ACTION ETHNICITY GENDER AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION IF AVAILABLE. THE GOAL IS TO SEE IF THERE ARE PATTERNS OF DISCRIMINATION IN THE DEPARTMENTS. AB SIXTEEN OH FOUR CALLS FOR STATE AGENCIES TO COLLECT AND REPORT DEMOGRAPHIC DATA USING MORE NUANCE CATEGORIES OF CALIFORNIANS OF AFRICAN DESCENT. SIMILAR TO THE DATA COLLECTED FOR CALIFORNIANS OF ASIAN DESCENT THIS DATA IS CRITICAL TO ACCURATELY REPORTING WHO AMONG CALIFORNIA'S AFRICAN% AMERICAN DESCENT. ARE AFRICAN DESCENT IS EXPERIENCING BARRIERS TO UPWARD MOBILITY. THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY SUPPORTED IN GOVERNANCE AND SIGNED A B. THIRTY ONE TWENTY ONE AUTHORED BY FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER DR SHIRLEY WEBER ESTABLISHING THE TASK FORCE TO STUDY AND DEVELOP pREPARATION PROPOSALS FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS.

HERE FOR FILE ITEM NUMBER FIVE. A. B. SEVENTEEN FOURTEEN PLEASE BEGIN COLLEAGUES EXCLUDED EMPLOYEES ARE GENERALLY EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE BEEN PROMOTED TO A SUPERVISORY OR MANAGEMENT LEVEL IN MANY INSTANCES MOST EMPLOYEE PROMOTES THEY LOSE MANY PROTECTIONS THAT ARE ENJOYED BY REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES. WHAT IS PROTECTIONS BINDING ARBITRATION AND EMPLOYEE EMPLOYER GRIEVANCES WHEN BINDING ARBITRATION IS USED IT PERMITS DISPUTES TO BE SOLVED QUICKLY AND A MUCH LOWER COST TO THE EMPLOYEE AND EMPLOYER WHEN IS NOT USE THOSE DISPUTES ARE TIME CONSUMING COSTLY UNBALANCED AB SEVENTY FOURTEEN WILL INCLUDE BINDING ARBITRATION IN THE EXCLUDED EMPLOYEE BILL OF RIGHTS. THIS ALL. MULTILEVEL GRIEVANCE PROCESS AND WILL SURVIVE STUDENTS USED TO MAKE FAIR AND EQUAL DECISIONS ON EMPLOYEE GRIEVANCES. WITH ME TODAY IS JOHN LEVEL REDUCING THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL SUPERVISORS ASSOCIATION- JOHN LOCAL ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONS SUPERVISOR. SPONSORS OF- OF- AB SEVENTEEN FOURTEEN- THIS BILL WILL FIX A BROKEN PROCESS RIGHT NOW WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT GRIEVANCES FROM EXCLUDED EMPLOYEES ARE ALL DENIED WITH MAYBE ONE OR TWO EXCEPTIONS BY CAL CHAR WHY BECAUSE THEY CAN IT'S TOTALLY ARBITRARY AND IT LEAVES THE EMPLOYEE WITH THE ONLY CHOICE OF JUST LETTING THE GRIEVANCE GO DENIED. OR GOING TO LITIGATION. NOW THE IRONY IS THAT CALIPARI IT IS WRONG HEADED RESULTS IN INCREASED COSTS COSTS FIRST OF ALL LITIGATION IS EXTRAORDINARILY EXPENSIVE FOR BOTH THE EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATION AND FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SECONDLY JUDGMENTS IN LITIGATION CAN BE VERY EXPENSIVE THERE'S A ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR JUDGMENT THAT WENT TO LITIGATION THAT IF IT HAD GONE TO ARBITRATION WOULD HAVE BEEN A FRACTION OF THAT AND LITIGATION JUDGMENTS HAVE PRECEDENTIAL VALUE. SO A BAD JUDGMENT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAN RESULT IN A MOM ON MULTIPLICITY OF JUDGMENTS ON THE OTHER HAND ARBITRATION- DOES NOT HAVE PRECEDENTIAL VALUE- SO THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS OF FOR THE- OF FOR THE STATE THE OTHER FEATURE OF THIS BILL. IS IT PROVIDES THAT THE LOSING PARTY IN AN ARBITRATION- SITUATION- HAS TO PAY THE COSTS NOW WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THE PARTIES HAVE AN INCENTIVE THEM. TO TRY AND NEGOTIATE A SETTLEMENT OF THE GRIEVANCE I MEAN IF WE HAVE A GRIEVANCE THAT GOES TO ARBITRATION ON OUR SIDE WE BETTER BE DARN SURE OF OUR- EXPECTATION OF PREVAILING IN FOR NOT THEN WE HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO SIT DOWN WITH THE STATE AND TRY AND RESOLVE THAT DISPUTE. THIS IS VERY GOOD LABOR POLICY IT IS VERY GOOD FISCAL POLICY- UNHAPPILY- CAL HR HAS- HAD A RIGID UNTHINKING OPPOSITION TO- TO THIS BILL- AND THEY NEVER COME TO THE LEGISLATURE TO DEFER IN THEIR POSITION. THEY BASICALLY HIDE IN THE BACK- AND THEN WHEN THE BILL GOES TO THE GOVERNOR THEY- WHISPER IN THE GOVERNOR'S HERE WITH FACTUALLY INACCURATE ASSERTIONS- AND- THEY HAVE FOOLED TWO GOVERNORS WE'RE GOING TO TRY AND- AND MOVE THIS FORWARD SO THAT WE GET THE SAME RESULT OF THIS TIME WE WANNA. COMMANDMENTS TO COOPER FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD IT IS A GOOD SENSE AND GOOD LABOR RELATIONS BILL AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE- TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND SEND IT FORWARD. THANK YOU OTHER OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IN THE ROOM. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ON THE PHONE. VERY WELL THE TELESISTEMA POSITION. WE DO HAVE ONE PARTY ON THE PHONE OKAY VERY WELL.

THE MAJORITY OF YOUR LINE STAFF HAVE BINDING ARBITRATION ALREADY IN CALAIS CIARA AGREEMENT PERCENT- THEY WILL NEVER COME FOR TO TALK ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND REALLY WORK IT OUT WITH YOU KNOW LITIGATION IS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE FOR THE STATE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE FOR THE UNIONS SO IT'S JUST. THERE'S REALLY NO REASON OTHER JUST BEING OBSTRUCTIONIST ON KELLY CHARGE PART NOT JUST THIS BILL THE OTHER BILLS AND OBSESS WITH INTERPRETATIONS MUCH CHEAPER AND IN THE DAY THE LOSER OF THE WITH THE BILLS WRITTEN. HAS TO PAY THE COURT COSTS SIDE I BELIEVE THAT ISN'T INCENTIVIZE FOLKS TO RESOLVE THINGS BUT THERE'S NO REASON THESE FOLKS WHO WERE WHO WE TRUST TO LEAD AND MANAGE IN THE STATE. SHOULD HAVE THE SAME PROTECTIONS THAT THEIR STAFF GETS ITS BINDING ARBITRATION THAT THAT'S VERY REASONABLE IT'S CHEAP IT'S MUCH QUICKER THAN GOING TO THE COURT SYSTEM SOME RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. WE HAVE A MO WE HAVE A SECOND. SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON AB SEVENTEEN FOURTEEN. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY COOPER HI COOPER AYE VOEPEL AYE VOEPEL AYECALDERON. BECAUSE THEY DON'T AYE COOLEY AYE COOLEY AYE O'DONNELL WELL DONE I THANK HE HI LACKEY I THAT BILL IS OUT SIX TO ZERO. IN THE BILL PASSES OUT APPROVED. THAT BRINGS US TO ITEM NUMBER SIX AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY TWO MISTER COOPER. THANK YOU MR CALL FIREFIGHTERS AND OTHER PUBLIC SAFETY EMPLOYEES FACE INHERENT DANGERS IN THEIR JOBS THAT NON SAFETY EMPLOYEES ARE NOT SUBJECT TO. FIREFIGHTERS ARE FIVE MORE TIMES LIKELY TO SUFFER RECLAIMED INJURIES COMPARED TO NON SAFETY EMPLOYEES R. P. THAT AGAIN FIVE MORE TIMES CURRENT LAW PROTECTS THE TEAM MEMBERS WHO GET INJURED ON THE JOB BY NOT FORCING THEM OUT OF THEIR USUAL DUTIES BEFORE THEY MEET THEIR RETIREMENT AGE. CURRENT LAW ALSO PROTECTS FIFTY MEMBERS FINAL RETIREMENT COMPENSATION MAY SUFFER A SERIOUS JOB RELATED INJURY THAT FORCES THEM INTO EARLY RETIREMENT. THOSE PROTECTIONS WILL SUNSET AT THE END OF THIS YEAR L. PLACE FIREFIGHTERS AND OTHER CITY MEMBERS RETIREMENT AT RISK AB SEVEN TWENTY TO MAKE INVESTING LAW PERMIT PROTECTING FIREFIGHTERS AND OTHER STATE UNIVERSE WHO PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE TO SERVE US. WITH ME TODAY IS MEGHAN'S TUBERS REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE MEGAN SUPERS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS POLICE TO BE- SPONSORING AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY TWO. AT THE AUTHOR STATED THAT THAT STATISTIC THAT'S FROM A RAND CORPORATION STUDY FROM TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY FOR A FIREFIGHTER TO EXPERIENCE A JOB RELATED INJURY OR ILLNESS INTO. A PRIVATE SECTOR WORKER- THIS PROVISION THAT IS DUE TO SUNSET AT THE END OF THIS YEAR HAS REALLY BEEN A LIFESAVER PARTICULARLY FOR- A FIREFIGHTER A PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER WHO MAY HAVE HAD THIRTY YEARS OF SERVICE BUT DID NOT REACH THAT NORMAL RETIREMENT AGE- IN CALPERS- THEY DIDN'T HAVE THIS ABILITY BUT PRIOR TO PEPPER AT TO. RECEIVE AN ACTUARIALLY REDUCED AMOUNT RETIREMENT IF THEY HAD NOT REACH THE AGE FIFTY- SO THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT AND WILLBRING PARITY AND CONTINUE PARITY FOR. FIREFIGHTERS AND PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND COUNTIES THIRTY SEVEN ACTS SYSTEMS THAT HAVE HAD SIMILAR PROVISIONS ON THE BOOKS. FOR MANY YEARS- SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO DELETING THE SUNSET WE THINK THE PREVIOUS EXTENSION HAS SHOWED THAT IT IS WORKING AND IT IS NOT- IMPACTING THE STATE IN ANY NEGATIVE WAY AND WE THINK IT'S- BENEFICIAL FOR. OUR SAFETY MEMBERS AND WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IN THE ROOM SUPPORT ON THE PHONE. ALL RIGHT LET'S GO TO OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IN THE ROOM. SEEING NONE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ON THE PHONE. PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME AND WE GOT A LINE OF TWENTY THREE PLEASE GO AHEAD.

CALDERON I COOLEY HI COOLEY FOR DONALD. O'DONNELL I LACKEY LACKEY I THANK BILL WITHOUT SUCCESS- THAT BRINGS US TO ITEM SEVEN A. B. SEVENTEEN SIXTY EIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COLLEAGUES I BELIEVE THAT THE CHANNELS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS THE US MILITARY RESERVES AND THE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD MEMBERS WHO WORK FOR THE STATE CAN BE ACTIVATED FOR MILITARY SERVICE. IN TIMES OF CRISIS THIS IS THE CASE DURING COVERT WE SERVICE MEMBERS RUPTURING UNDER PRESIDENTIAL DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY ONCE ACTIVATED THE SERVICE MEMBERS CAN ONLY BE COMPENSATED FOR THE AMOUNT AUTHORIZED BY THE NATIONAL GUARD OR RESERVES AND NOT BY THEIR EMPLOYER. BY LAW THE SERVICE MEMBERS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE MADE WHOLE OTHER COMPENSATION EQUAL TO THEIR STATE CIVILIAN EMPLOYMENT. THIS IS NOT HOW IT TRANSPIRED DURING THE PANDEMIC OF COVERT. DUE TO A LACK OF CLARITY IN EXISTING LAW MANY OF OUR SERVICE MEMBERS PAY WAS DELAYED IN SOME CASES UP TO A YEAR. IT IS UNTHINKABLE THAT OUR SERVICE MEMBERS ARE CALLED IN THE SERVICE. PLACE HARM'S WAY THE SAME TIME PLACE INTO A FINANCIAL HARDSHIP. SB SEVEN SIXTY EIGHT CLARIFIES THE INTENT OF THE LAW FOR OUR SERVICE MEMBERS DO NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MEETING THEIR PERSONAL FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. WHEN CALLED UP TO ACTIVE DUTY. WITH ME IS MATTHEW EASLEY CHIEF LOBBYIST FOR THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION THE SPONSORS. MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MATT EASILY REPRESENT A CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION. WE CAN SUPPORT AS THE SPONSOR OF AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY EIGHT. SINCE MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY THE UNITED STATES IN OPERATING UNDER PRESIDENTIAL DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY AS A RESULT OF THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AND SINCE THAT TIME STATE EMPLOYEES WHO ARE SERVING IN THE NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVES HAVE BEEN ACTIVATED ACROSS THE STATE IN RESPONSE THAT DECLARATION. SEVERAL OF THE STATE EMPLOYEES ARE CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS AND MEMBERS OF THE C. P. O. A.
