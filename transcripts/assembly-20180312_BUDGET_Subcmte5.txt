I THINK THAT CAN YOU HEAR ME. GREAT. THE ASSEMBLY STEPPED UP BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER FIVE DEALING WITH ISSUES OF PUBLIC SAFETY. WE'RE GOING TO IT BEGAN AS A SUBCOMMITTEE WE HAVE SOME MEMBERS BECAUSE OF OBVIOUSLY THE CELEBRATION OF THE DAY. OF THAT WILL NOT BE HERE FOR ANOTHER TWENTY MINUTES BUT WE WANT TO HOLD YOU ANY LONGER UNDERSTAND SOME OF YOU. ARE GOOD AN AVID READER AND RIP THAT WE'VE BOTH STARTED TO THIRTY AND THOUGH AND THAT CHANGED A TO A JOURNEY I MEAN. BASICALLY BEGINNING AT THE END OF ADJOURNMENT OF THE. OF THE FLOOR SESSION SO WE WANT TO RESPECT YOUR TIME AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND BEGAN AS A SUBCOMMITTEE. WE DON'T HAVE ANY ITEMS THAT WILL ACTUALLY BE VOTED ON TODAY THEY'LL BE HOLD HELD OVER BUT YOU'LL HEAR FROM THE COMMITTEES. THE HEAR FROM THE STAFF AND YOU WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND AND MAKE PUBLIC COMMENTS CONCERNING THOSE MATTERS. WE HAVE TWELVE ITEMS ON THE AGENDA TODAY OF THAT WILL BE LOOKING AT AND SO. WITH THAT WE WILL BEGIN. OUR SESSION O. IT AS A SUBCOMMITTEE WITH THE FIRST GROUP WHAT ISSUE NUMBER ONE DEALING WOULD RECEIVE A SHIPMENT OVERVIEW. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR. ONLINE AND CLARK KELSO ON THE RECEIVER IN CHARGE OF A MEDICAL CARE IN CALIFORNIA'S PRISON SYSTEM. BY WAY OF AN OVERVIEW HOCKEY MY COMMENTS BRIEF IN THE RESPOND ANY QUESTIONS MEMBERS MAY HAVE. I JUST TELL YOU WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. IAN. IN THE CASE OF SENSUALLY. OR WE HAVE AND ALSO. TODAY. I'VE YOU ARE TAKE OR WHERE THIS ON A PROCESS OF REVIEW IN DELEGATION OF INDIVIDUAL INSTITUTIONS FOR MANAGEMENT BACK TO THE STATE. I ES UP TODAY WE HAVE DELEGATED I BELIEVE BY MY COUNT FIFTEEN INSTITUTIONS. I WOULD NOTE ON PAGE ONE OF THE REPORT I IT HAS. THE LAST SENTENCE OF THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THE BACKGROUND HAS SOME SOMEWHAT DATED INFORMATION. INDICATING WE HAD DELEGATED TEN AS OF JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTEEN. A BUT AS OF TODAY UP WERE UP TO FIFTEEN. I HAVE ALSO SCHEDULED. DELEGATION MEET AND CONFERS BEFORE I DELEGATE I'M REQUIRED TO MEET WITH THE PARTIES. I'M WE HAVE DELEGATED THOSE ESSENTIALLY AT A RATE OF ABOUT ONE. A MONTH A FEW MONTHS COMING FORD WILL HAVE TO A MONTH. ON THE SCHEDULE THEM FOR A CONSIDERING DELEGATION OF THE REMAINING PRISONS. STRETCHES OUT UNTIL ABOUT FEBRUARY OR MARCH OF TWENTY NINETEEN. THE PROCESS THAT WILL DELEGATION. IN EVALUATING A DELEGATION IS DATA INTENSIVE. ON THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL HAS TO COMPLETE ITS REPORTS FOR AN INSTITUTION. I RECEIVE A REPORT FROM THREE COURT EXPERTS. THE A PLAINTIFFS IN THE STATE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO A PROVIDE INPUT. SO THERE'S A LOT THAT'S GOING INTO EACH ONE OF THESE DECISIONS. I AFTER I DO A DELEGATION. ESSENTIALLY THE. IF THERE IS REASON TO REVOKE A DELEGATE. PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL MORE BRING ABOUT THE TO MY ATTENTION. I'M SO FAR WE HAVE HAD A KNOW REPLICATIONS OF ANY DELEGATION. I END THAT WE KNOW FOR MANY OF THE. POST DELEGATION VISITS BY THE PLANT THE PRISON LAW OFFICE. THAT THAT WHAT THEY'RE SEEING BASICALLY HILLS. ARE A CONTINUATION. OF OPERATIONS OR AN IMPROVEMENT IN OPERATIONS. SO WE WERE AT THIS POINT I'M FAIRLY COMFORTABLE THAT THE DECISIONS BUT I MAKING US TO WHAT WHAT TO DELEGATE. OUR THEY ARE SOLID DECISIONS. AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING I MEAN FOR MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION STEADILY. ON SECOND THING I THINK IS USEFUL TO REPORT ON. JUDGE HENDERSON WHO PRESIDED OVER THE CASE A FROM TWO THOUSAND AND TWO UNTIL ON AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN. HE HAS RETIRED FROM THE BENCH. AND THE CASE IS NOW BEEN ASSIGNED TO A DIFFERENT FEDERAL JUDGE IN SAN FRANCISCO A JOHN TIGER. UP WHO IS TAKING A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO MANAGEMENT OF THIS PART OF THE CASE. I THINK THE THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IS A JUDGE HENDERSON. WOULD PROVIDE. GARDENS TO ME AND AT TIMES TO THE PARTIES BUT WOULD DO SO MOSTLY INFORMALLY WITHOUT HAVING HEARINGS AND MOTIONS. AND THE OTHER RESULT. THE CASE WAS. IT MOVED FORWARD WITHOUT A SOMETIMES THE BURDENS OF LAWYERS. IF I CAN SAY THAT HAS A LAW PROFESSOR I GET A CHANCE TO SAY THAT. WHAT THE LAWYERS BEHIND ME I'M SURE ARE BURNING IN THEIR EARS? JUDGE TIGER HAS DECIDED THAT THERE SHOULD BE A STATUS LIKE FORMAL STATUS CONFERENCE IN HIS COURT. EVERY THREE MONTHS OR SO. AND HE HAS REQUIRED THE PARTIES TO MEET AND CONFER BEFORE THESE HEARINGS AND PROVIDE A STATUS REPORT. AND ARE NO QUESTION THAT'S THAT PROCESS THAT MORE FORMAL PROCESS IS HELPING TO FOCUS. THE PARTIES. ON WHAT THEY AGREE IT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO AND THE CASE. AND TO IDENTIFY ANY AREAS OF DISAGREEMENT. AND I THINK THAT'S A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE YOU KNOW TEN YEARS AGO THE GOLF WOULD HAVE BEEN HUGE. BUT AT THIS POINT. THERE ACTUALLYIS. SUBSTANTIAL AGREEMENT AS TO WHAT NEEDS TO FINISH. AND THEN A FEW THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE WHERE THE PARTIES DISAGREE AND THE JUDGE AYE THERE WILL. OUR RESOLVE THOSE THAT YES THEY HAVE TO BE DONE ORIEL DECIDE NO THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE DONE. THEM BUT THOSE CASE MANAGEMENT JOINT CASE MANAGEMENT STATEMENTS. PROVIDE RELIEF VERY USEFUL ROAD MAP. TO. THE CONCLUSION OF THE CASE. AND I THINK I'LL STOP AT THAT POINT AND SEE IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS. ANY OF IT. A TESTIMONY. THE QUESTIONS. ONE OF THE QUESTION SO THE UPDATE IS FIFTEEN PRESENCE THAT HAVE BEEN DELEGATED BACK TO THE STATE FOR CONTROL OF THE STATE. ARE AND YOU'RE SAYING TO US THAT YOU ANTICIPATE THAT THIS. THE REMAINDER OF OF THE PRISONS WILL BE THAT WILL HAPPEN FOR THEM BY TWENTY. NINETEEN WE WE HAVE SCHEDULED ON THE MEET AND CONFER MEETINGS OF TO THE END SO THAT'S THROUGH THE SECOND OR THIRD MONTH TWENTY NINETEEN. OUR I CAN'T TELL RIGHT NOW HOW MANY OF THOSE WOULD BE ACTUALLY DELEGATED. BUT. WE ARE TO POINT WHERE ANY I CAN LOOK AT A CALENDAR AND SAY WE'RE AT LEAST CONSIDERING DELEGATION OF THE REMAINING PRISONS. BY FEBRUARY OR MARCH OF TWENTY NINETEEN. WHICH IS ON IMPROVEMENT FROM WHERE WE WERE SEVERAL YEARS AGO. OKAY. OF ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS. TURNING THIS. OKAY HEARING THOUGH COMMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR REPORT. THIS ITEM US OBVIOUSLY WILL BE HELD OVER. TOUGH FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION AND VOTE. WOULD AT THE ITEM NUMBER TWO ISSUE NUMBER TWO THE RECEIVERS LIKE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD SYSTEM.

THAT TEXAS ITEM NUMBER FIVE DOUBLE EQUIPMENT. YES SO WE'VE PUT FORWARD A. BCP TO REQUEST FOR SOME DENTAL EQUIPMENT FUNDING. WE NEED TO ESTABLISH A REPLACEMENT SCHEDULE. MUCH OF THE EQUIPMENT THAT IS ONLINE IN THOSE DENTAL CLINICS WAS DONE IN TWO THOUSAND SIX TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. AND SO ALL. MUCH OF THE EQUIPMENT IS IS GOING BEYOND USABLE LIFE. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY REPLACED. WHO WOULD WORK ON A A BREAK FIX APPROACHED EQUIPMENT? AND IT'S LED US TO HAVE TO DO SECTION SIX WHO ARE TWENTY SIX IS TO REMOVE FUNDING ARE REAL LIFE ANY FROM OTHER PROGRAMS. SO WE REALLY NEED TO ESTABLISH A. EQUIPMENT BASELINE. IN ADDITION WHEN YOU KNOW DEL EQUIPMENT BREAKS IT. EIGHT CREATES A LOT OF DOWNTIME YOU. THERE'S NOT A LOT OF OTHER OPTIONS. TO PROVIDE CARE WHEN IT COMES TO DENTAL YOU NEED THE TYPE OF EQUIPMENT THAT THEY HAVE IN THOSE CLINICS. AND SO. WE'D LIKE TO SECURE SOME FUNNY TO CREATE A REPLACEMENT SCHEDULE FOR SOME CRITICAL EQUIPMENT. OKAY. COMMENTS FROM FINANCE AMAZON WORTH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH LA OVER THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION OKAY RIGHT ALEJO. PAT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR KITTEN O'NEILL ILIO THE DEPARTMENT HAS ESTIMATED THAT AS A RESULT OF THIS PROPOSAL IT WOULD SPEND ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS LESS ANNUALLY ON. EQUIPMENT REPAIR GIVEN THAT THIS DENTAL EQUIPMENT WOULD BE RELATIVELY NEWER UNDER THIS PROPOSAL SO WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE MODIFY THE PROPOSAL BY REDUCING THE COST REQUESTED AMOUNT BY HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY. SOUNDS GOOD EVERYONE IS IN AGREEMENT ON THAT THAT'S WONDERFUL AND. YEAH BUT WITH A WONDERFUL. ANY COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. OKAY ANY COMMENT FROM THE AUDIENCE PUBLIC COMMENT. CURRENT WANT TO THANK YOU ALL TO FOR WORKING TOGETHER MAKES A LIFE A LOT EASIER WHEN WE AGREE THAT THERE ARE SOME. MODIFICATIONS THAT CAN BE MADE IN THIS ITEM WILL BE HELD OVER AS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WIT ITEM NUMBER SIX. O. DENTAL ORAL SURGERY YES WE. SUPPORT AN ORAL SURGERY PROPOSAL. THE OTHER HALF OF THE HUGE DEFICIENCY IN THE DAHLE BUDGET IS DRIVEN BY ALSO FOR ALL SURGERIES THESE ARE SURGERIES THAT ARE ABOVE A NORMAL. DENNIS SCOPE OF WORK AND SO WE HAVE TO CONTRACT FOR THESE MORE DIFFICULT SURGERIES AND WERE WE WOULD LIKE TO CREATE A BASELINE FOR THAT. THOUGH SURGERIES AND AND IT IS A CRITICAL NEED TO THE DEPARTMENT. OKAY ANY COMMENTS FROM FINANCE REALLY WELL NOW. MEMBERS COMMENTS. OKAY ANYONE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. THAT ITEM WILL BE HELD OVER ALSO THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WOULD NOT ITEM NUMBER SEVEN WHICH IS A MENTAL HEALTH BAD MANAGEMENT. SO. HOME SO WE PUT TOGETHER A BCP UP FOR THE HOPE THAT MANAGEMENT THAT'S REQUESTING TWENTY POINT ONE MILLION AND UNDER FIFTEEN NINE POSITIONS. IT'S BROKEN DOWN INTO SOME SUBSECTIONS. THE FIRST SECTION IS AN INMATE REPORTING UNIT AND THE SEMI REPORTING UNIT WILL. PROVIDE SOMEBODY REALIZATION OVERSIGHT AND. HELP US COMPLY WITH IMPATIENT TIMELINES. THAT WE. HAVE GOTTEN IN TROUBLE WITH BY BY NOT MOVING OUR INMATES. FAST ENOUGH TO THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF CARE. WE ALSO HAVE THE HEALTH CARE POPULATION UNIT WE CALL HIT POP AND HIP POP. REFERS THE PATIENTS TO THE APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF CARE AND ENSURES THAT THERE IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE HOUSING AND WE NEED SOME MORE DEDICATED STAFF FOR THAT AREA AS WELL TO HELP FACILITATE THOSE MOVEMENTS. WE'D ALSO LIKE TO CREATE SIX REFLECTS BIRDS THIRTY OF THOSE WOULD BE AT CMF AND THIRTY WOULD BE A SEAT STUFF AND PLEASE FLEX BEDS WILL ALLOW US TO FLEX BETWEEN MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS BIRDS. AND THEN ARE IMPATIENT ACU AND INTERMEDIATE OF LEVELS OF CARE. AND WE FEEL OF IT WOULD GIVE US. A WAY TO REACT TO SOME OF THE SPIKES THAT WE'VE SEEN THE SYSTEM SO OVER THE SUMMER MONTHS REALLY SEE SPIKES IN ALL CRISIS BIRDS. AND THEN WE SEE THE INTERMEDIATE CARE IN THE ACUTE CARE GO UP. IN THE FALL MONTHS AND SO BY ALLOWING US TO FLEX THESE BIRDS IT WOULD ALLOW US TO BE MORE AGILE TO THE POPULATION NEEDS SO WE WOULD LIKE TO CREATE TO THOSE UNITS WANT TO SEE HIM AFTER ONE AT SEAT CF. IN ADDITION. WE'D LIKE TO CREATE TWENTY UNLICENSED MOVEMENT HOPE CRISIS BEDS AT CIW CALIFORNIA CITIES ARE FOR WOMEN. TO CREATE SOME ADDITIONAL FEMALE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS BEDS. AS YOU MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW WE HAVE TWO FEMALE FACILITIES IN THE SYSTEM. SO WE NEED TO BE CREATIVE IN TRYING TO GET SOME ADDITIONAL BEDS TO MEET THEIR NEEDS BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN THAT SCENE THE CRISIS BUT NEEDS FOR FOR FEMALES INCREASES WHILE. WE ALSO HAVE A HUGE GAP OF MIDDLE HEALTH CRISIS BEDS IN THE SOUTHERN REGION. OF THE STATE. AND IN ORDER TO TRY AND ADDRESS THAT NEED IN A COST EFFECTIVE APPROACH WE'RE GOING TO TAKE DOWN AN UNLICENSED UNIT AS. CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON SACRAMENTO AND TRANSFER THOUGH THAT TWENTY BED UNIT DOWN TO RICHARD J. DONOVAN CHO A CORRECTIONAL FACILITY IN THE SOUTH. TO CREATE SOME ADDITIONAL MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS BEDS DOWN THERE IN TOW WE CAN HOPEFULLY GET A FEW OF OUR OTHER PROPOSALS. MOVING. AND THEN FINALLY WE'RE ASKING FOR. SOME POSITIONS FOR OFFICE OF RESEARCH RIGHT NOW OF THE COURTS HAVE. DIRECTED US OR ORDERED US TO WORK WITH MCMANUS CONSULTING GROUP TO PROVIDE OUR MENTAL HEALTH PROJECTIONS. WE'D LIKE TO BRING THAT BACK UNDER THE HOUSE OF CDC ARE. WE HAVE TO PROVE THAT WE CAN MANAGE THESE PROJECTIONS WE ALSO FEEL THAT THE OFFICE OF RESEARCH HAS SOME. EXPERTISE IN THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF CUSTODY. AND HOPEFULLY WILL BE ABLE TO GIVE US. MORE SOLID MENTAL HEALTH PROJECTIONS BUT ALSO BRING IT BACK UNDER THE VEIL OF CDC ARE. IN IN HOPES OF ENDING THIS COURT CASE AND AND MOVING OUT FROM UNDER THE FEDERAL COURTS OKAY. MY COMMENTS WERE FINANCE AMAZON WORTH PART OF FINANCE AGAIN. I ALSO I WOULD HAVE A LITTLE BIT TO THE PROJECTION. COMMENT. SO IT DOESN'T HURT TO KNOW THE HIPAA DOES A LOT OF THE PROJECTIONS NOW WITH MCMANUS PROVIDING THE OVERSIGHT. AND SO IT'S KIND OF HARD TO COMPARE THE COST OF THAT CONTRACT. FOR WITH MCMANUS TO THE COST OF THE RESOURCES FOR OFFICE OF RESEARCH BECAUSE HIP HOP IS ALREADY DOING A LOT OF THE WORK. SO. NO THROUGH PUZZLES NOT ONLY TO TRANSITION OVER TO THE OFFICE OF RESEARCH ALSO TO FREE UP SOME A PIC POTS RESOURCES OF THE CAN FOCUS MORE ON THE. PATIENT MONITORING IT THAT MOVEMENT AS WELL. SO I THINK IF WE WERE PROPOSING TO MOVE IT TO THE OFFICE OF RESEARCH WE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE ANOTHER REQUEST HIGHER RESOURCES FOR. THE KID MANAGE THEIR WORKLOAD EFFICIENTLY OKAY. ANY COMMENTS FROM FELLOW JONATHAN PETERSON WITH THE LA SHOW AS THE DEPARTMENT INDICATED THIS ITEM INCLUDES VARIOUS PROPOSALS WE MADE THREE RECOMMENDATIONS ON SOME ASPECTS OF THE. THE GOVERNOR'S VARIOUS PROPOSALS. FIRST WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED LIMITED TERM FUNDING AS OPPOSED TO ONGOING FUNDING FOR THE FLEX BEDS. THESE BEDS WOULD BE STAFFED IN A WAY THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO BE. TO SERVE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS BED PATIENTS. BASED ON THE DEPARTMENT'S CURRENT PROJECTIONS FOR MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS BEDS THAT AND THAT NEED APPEARS TO BE TEMPORARY. SWEEPING PROVIDING FUNDING ON AN LIMITED FOR YOUR LIMITED TERM BASIS WOULD ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO ADDRESS THIS NEED. SECOND WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THE PROPOSED FUNDING FOR THE OFFICE OF RESEARCH STAFF. TO TAKE OVER THE MENTAL HEALTH PROJECTIONS WE'RE AWARE OF ANY PARTICULAR. INACCURACIES ARE PROBLEMS WITH THE CURRENT MENTAL HEALTH PROJECTIONS THAT JUSTIFY THE EIGHT TIMES AS MUCH COSTS FOR CDC ARE TO TAKE OVER THESE PROJECTIONS. THIRD AND FINALLY WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED FUNDING FOR THE ARE YOU AND HIT POP STAFF THAT THE DEPARTMENT MENTIONED. BECAUSE THESE COULD HELP. MOVE PATIENTS INAPPROPRIATE TREATMENT FASTER AND REDUCE THE NEED FOR. MET MENTAL HEALTH BEDS NOT IN THE FUTURE. ANY QUESTIONS FROM. MEMBERS. OKAY OF. OF. OKAY NICK ANY COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE. OKAY. THIS QUESTION OBVIOUSLY IS RELATED TO OBVIOUSLY ITEMS EVEN NINE AS WELL SO WE'RE GOING TO. HERE THAT AND THEN ALL THIS WILL KIND OF FIT TOGETHER WITH REGARDS TO THE MENTAL HEALTH BATES IN THE CAPACITY IN OUR ASSESSMENT. OF WHAT WE MEET SO THAT TAKE ITEMS EIGHT AND NINE. RIGHT NOW TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY ALSO COMPLEMENT NUMBER ITEM NUMBER SEVEN DEALING WITH MENTAL HEALTH THREATS. AND OTHER THE VARIOUS OF. MIDDLE HAVE BE IT'S CRISIS IN FACILITIES AND AND HOW WE FUNDED AND WHAT WHAT PASSED THE LOOKS LIKE. OKAY. THIS ITEM EIGHT AND I THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE FOR MEN THE FIFTY BAD MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS FACILITY AND THE DAY JOB OF THE RICHARD JONATHAN'S CORRECTIONAL FACILITY IN THE SAN DIEGO AREA. OTHER FIFTY MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS BE IT'S THE OF SODAS THOSE BIT SO UP YES. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS DEAN BORG REPRESENTING THE FACILITY PLANNING CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT DIVISION FOR CDC ARE. THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN BUDGET ACT INCLUDED FUNDING TO BEGIN THE DESIGN PROCESS FOR TWO BUILDINGS AS YOU'VE MENTIONED AT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PRISONS. THAT CAN PROVIDE LICENSE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT AT THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS INTERMEDIATE OR CUTE CARE LEVEL OF CARE. A PROPOSAL BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE WOULD PROVIDE APPROXIMATELY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO COMPLETE THE DESIGN PHASE FOR THESE TWO BUILDINGS. THE PRIMARY IMPETUS BEHIND THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT CCR DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT LICENSE BED CAPACITY TO MEET THE CURRENT PROJECTED INPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT NEEDS. SO SO THE COMBINATION OF ACUTE INPATIENT AND MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS IS ALL CARED FOR IN A LICENSE DOES IN ANY LICENSE CARE. ARE CURRENTLY IN ORDER TO MEET THAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR LICENSE BED AND THAT BAD TREATMENT NEED WE OPERATE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR UNLICENSED A MENTAL HEALTH BEDS. THERE ONLY A WE CAN ONLY OPERATE THEM BASED ON WAIVERS FROM THE FEDERAL COURT. AS LONG AS THE SYSTEM DEPENDS UPON COURT GRANTED WAIVERS TO PROVIDE A PORTION OF OUR CAPACITY. IT IT WILL NOT BE REALISTIC FOR THE STATE TO BE IN A POSITION TO END COURT SUPERVISION. EQUITIES ANALYSIS INCLUDED A CHART PROVIDED BY THE LA OWE A WHICH FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON THE PROJECTED NEEDS FOR MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS BEDS. WE BELIEVE AS I'VE MENTIONED THAT THE LICENSE BUT NEEDS TO BE VIEWED AS A CONTINUUM ACROSS THE THREE LEVELS AND A PROVIDED. THE A COMMITTEE STAFF IN THE ILLEGAL WITH A CHART THAT SHOWS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PROJECTED OVERALL BUT NEEDS FOR THOSE THREE LEVELS AND THE EXISTING CAPACITY. AND AS. WAS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY THESE TWO PRESENTS ARE LOCATED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE US A SEVERE DEFICIT OF. CRISIS BEDS AND OTHER TYPES OF MENTAL HEALTH LICENSE TREATMENT BEDS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW. CATHARINE KEEP ROCKER DIPPY DIRECT FROM AND HEALTH PROGRAMS IS HERE. TO SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE NEED FOR THESE BEDS. GOOD AFTERNOON AYE CATHERINE TO BROCK DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THAT STATEWIDE MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM AT CDC ARE. OCCURRED I THINK A COUPLE OF THINGS ARE IMPORTANT FOR AYE THIS GROUP TO NO ONE IS THAT WE'VE BEEN LABORING UNDER A SERIES OF COURT ACTIONS. OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR. MARCH AND APRIL ORDERS. THAT CONCERN THE DELAY AND MOVEMENT OF PATIENTS TO IN PATIENT HOUSING AS WELL AS THE SUFFICIENCY. OF. OF THOSE NUMBERS. AND THE DELAY IN MOVEMENT IS INEXTRICABLY INTERTWINED WITH OUR ABILITY TO WITH A SUFFICIENT NUMBER INSUFFICIENT NUMBER. UP BECAUSE. WE NEED TO MOVE PEOPLE OUT IN ORDER TO MOVE THE MEN'S SUIT ENDS UP BEING A BIT OF A DOMINO. UP WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING HERE IS REALLY. TAKING IT A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO HOW WE MANAGE THESE BEDS. THROUGH THE THE UP PROPOSAL THAT YOU PROVED LAST YEAR UP FOR THAT FLEX BAD FOR TAKING THAT SAME CONCEPT HERE. AND APPROACH THE IDEA IS TO BE ABLE TO FLEX I WITH THE DYNAMIC NEEDS OF THE POPULATION. THOUGHT THE POPULATION'S NEEDS FLEX PRETTY DRAMATICALLY OVER THE COURSE OF EACH YEAR WE NOTE IN THE. WINTER FALL WINTER MONTHS THE NEED FOR CRISIS BAD TENDS TO BUY DIP I AND IN THE SUMMER MONTHS IT TENDS TO INCREASE. AND SO WERE TRYING TO IDENTIFY A WAY TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THOSE SPIKES IN NEED AND THIS IS ONE WAY OUT THAT WE CAN THINK TO ADEQUATELY. ABOUT RESPOND TO THOSE FLEXING NEEDS. WE DO HAVE CURRENT WEIGHTLESS FOR A HOT CRISIS BED MOVEMENT. I SHOULD ACTUALLY TAKE ME I'M SORRY I SHOULD GO BACK AND REFLECT FOR A MOMENT ABOUT THE TODD THE ORDERS THAT WE RECEIVED. THE ORDERS REQUIRE OUT STRICT ADHERENCE TO TIME LINES AND HAVE THREATENED. A SANCTION MONETARY SANCTION FOR ABOUT MISSING THOSE TIME LINES. I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT WE CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH CRISIS BET WAIT LESS. MANY OF THOSE. PATIENTS WAIT. MUCH LONGER THAN IS APPROPRIATE. AND WE'RE WORKING DILIGENTLY TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT. BUT. SIMPLY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH BEDS. AND WE. CAN'T ALLOW CONTINUE TO ALLOW THOSE FIVE PATIENTS TO SIT IN. IN APPROPRIATE SETTINGS WAITING FOR THE RIGHT THAT. THIS GUIDE THIS PROPOSAL THOUGH DOES RETURN US TO. DOES ALLOW US TO MOVE PEOPLE MORE QUICKLY WE HAVE A. A GREAT NEED IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE BY THE MAJORITY OF OUR BEDS HOWEVER IN THE NORTHERN PART THE STATE. SO THIS PROPOSAL ALLOWS US TO RESPOND. MORE QUICKLY OUGHT TO THOSE NEEDS BY GETTING THEM QUICKER INTO OF BEDS LOOK PROXIMATE TO THEIR. HOME INSTITUTION. YEAH. IT COMMENTS FROM FINANCE. BELIAU. JONATHAN PETERSON LA SO WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE WORKING DRAWINGS FUNDING FOR THE TO MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS PET PROJECTS AS THE CURRENT PROJECTIONS SUGGEST. THAT THE ADDITIONAL BEDS WOULD NOT BE NECESSARY BY THE TIME THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS COULD BE COMPLETED. ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT THESE ADDITIONAL BEDS ARE NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS BEDS AND REPLACE UNLICENSED MENTALHEALTH CRISIS BEDS BASED ON THE CURRENT PROJECTIONS. THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS BEDS APPEARS TO BE MANAGEABLE WITH THE SIXTY FLEX BEDS THAT WE HAD JUST TALKED ABOUT A PREVIOUS ITEM. IN TO THE EXTENT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO WANTS TO USE THESE PADS TO ADDRESS BROADER. PROPER BROADER UNLICENSED BED ISSUES. WE WOULD JUST KNOW THAT. TO THE EXTENT THE PROJECTIONS ARE IN THAT ARE EITHER OVERESTIMATE THE NEED WE COULD BE IN A POSITION WHERE WE MAY HAVE TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE UNLICENSED BEDS ANYWAY. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE I NEED FOR THESE BEDS IS. OVERESTIMATED WE MIGHT BE IN A POSITION WHERE THE CONSTRUCTION IS NOT NECESSARY SO DEPENDS ON WHICH. THE DIFFERENT WAYS IN DIFFERENT STRATEGIES IN WHICH THESE PROPOSALS ARE ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS. OKAY. ANY COMMENTS FROM. MEMBERS. ONE OF MR LACKEY AROUND SEVEN EIGHT AND NINE. ANY COMMENTS ON THE PUBLIC. DO YOU HAVE ANY RESPONSE TO THAT I MEAN THERE BAY BASICALLY WE'RE BEING TOLD THAT BY THE TIME THE CONSTRUCTION OCCURS. THAT THEY'LL BE NO NEED FOR THE SPIRITS. SO WE'D BE BUILDING SOMETHING A HUNDRED BITS I GUESS. THAT IN TIME WOULD NOT BE NEED. BASED ON YOUR PROJECTIONS OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO LOOK LIKE I'M THE LEADER IS A CHARLIE PRESENTED TO THE COMMITTEE AT A SHOW THAT WE'VE YOU REVIEW THOSE NUMBERS. DIFFERENTLY SO BASED UPON THE CAPACITY OF THE BEDS WE HAVE RIGHT NOW THEY PROJECTED NEEDS FOR ALL LEVELS OF CARE NOT JUST MY HOPE CRISIS BAD BUT FOR ALL THOSE LICENSE LEVELS OF CARE WILL STILL EXCEED OUR CAPACITY GOING FORWARD AND WE WOULD NEED TO CONTINUE TO USE. UNLOCK UNLICENSED BANDS. AND THAT'S BASED ON THE CURRENT THE CURRENT PROJECTIONS SHOWING AB DECREASE IN THE MIDDLE OF POPULATION OVERALL. THAT'S BASED ON THE FIRST SET A POPULATION PROTECTIONS TO INCORPORATE A HOME PROP FIFTY SEVEN. OBVIOUSLY MORE TIME IS NECESSARY TO TRULY SEE WHAT OF TREND LINE IS FROM THE LOOK FROM THOSE PROJECTIONS MY. THE THE FLEX BUT. THE FLEX BEDS WERE MENTIONED EARLIER. BITE VIEWING IT ACROSS ALL THREE LEVELS OF CARE ELIMINATES WHETHER THAT SIXTY BEDS IN THE CRISIS BY CATEGORY THE ICF CATEGORY BECAUSE WE'RE SIMPLY SAYING FOR ALL THE BEDS AVAILABLE FOR LICENSE CARE. WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH AND FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE BASED UPON OUR PROJECTIONS WILL NEED TO CONTINUE USING UNLICENSED BEDS. AND FROM THE STANDPOINT OF LOOKING TO A DAY WHEN THE STATE. AS DICK MANY ACTIONS BUT LOOKING TO A DAY WHEN THE STATE CAN GET OUT OF COURT SUPERVISION. NOT HAVING. THE CAPACITY TO PROVIDE CARE BASED ON YOUR OWN PROJECTIONS. IS IT DIFFICULT PART TO US START THE CONVERSATION WITH THE COURT. OKAY SENT IT. OKAY UP. I THINK. ONE MORE POINT. YOU NEED TO GO TO THE MIKE THANK YOU SORRY OTHER ONE MORE POINT WORTH MENTIONING. WE HAVE A COURT ORDER TO RUN THE LICENSE BEDS. SO THE COURTS ARE ALLOWING US TO RUN THOSE LICENSE BEDS AND SO. IN ORDER TO SEE WE NEED THAT COURT ORDER TO KEEP USING THEM SO WE NEED THESE LICENSE BUT TO REPLACE THOSE ON LICENSE BIRDS. OTHERWISE THE COURTS ARE ALLOWING US TO CONTINUE SO IF WE WANT TO GET AWAY FROM THE COURTS WE WE NEED TO TO GET SOME LICENSE BEDS IN THE SOUTH ESPECIALLY. I WE CURRENTLY TRANSPORTING PEOPLE TO BE SPIRITS. BETTER THAT WE DON'T HAVE NOW I MEAN IN TERMS OF NEW YEAR'S GIFT AT SOME BETS. THERE SO WHERE BASICALLY TRANSPORTING INDIVIDUALS THERE THAT YEAH BUT THE SHORT VERSION IS THAT WE ARE MOVINGPEOPLE FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SOMETIMES ALL THE WAY UP THE STATE. IN ORDER TO GET THEM INTO A CRISIS SPED UP THE TIME IT TAKES. TO MOVE THEM AND THAT THE TRAVEL ITSELF IS DISRUPTIVE TO THE PATIENTS HAD TO THEIR CARE GNAWED IT IS. CERTAINLY CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE TO UP KEEP THE UP PATIENTS PROXIMATE TO THEIR UP HOME INSTITUTION AND MINIMIZE THAT TRAVEL. WE'VE ENDEAVOR TO DO THAT TO THE EXTENT WE CAN AT THIS PROPOSAL GETS US PART AWAY THERE BUT IT IS NOT A PERMANENT FIX. THE PERMANENT SOLUTION IS THOSE HUNDRED ADDITIONAL BATS. OKAY OKAY IT IN ADDITION WE HAVE FOURTEEN MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS BEDS RGD AND WE HAVE TWELVE IT CIW WHICH IS AN ALL FEMALE FACILITY. SO LET'S GET TWENTY SIX BEDS IN THE IN THE SOUTHERN REGION. MADAM CHAIR IF I MIGHT THERE IS ALSO A PROPOSAL FROM THE PREVIOUS ITEM THAT INCLUDES MOVING TWENTY BEDS ALBEIT UNLICENSED BIRDS REMOVED FROM A SACRAMENTO DOWN TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SEVEN OKAY. ALRIGHT. ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS. WHEN I'M I'M DONE WITH OTHER FINANCE AGAIN. I THINK WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL FOR THE BEDS WE THINK THEY ARE NECESSARY TO SHOW THE COURT THAT WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS SO THAT WE EVENTUALLY WHEN. YOU KNOW WE ARE NOT UNDER COVER OF COCOA COURT OVERSIGHT WE WILL HAVE THE NECESSARY LICENSE FADS. TO IT YOU KNOW HOPE OUR PATIENTS I THINK ALSO MENTAL HEALTH PROJECTIONS ARE HARD. IT'S HARD TO PROJECT WHAT OUR POPULATION IS GOING TO DO ESPECIALLY FIVE YEARS OUT. AND IT'S HOT IT'S. EASIER BUT SEE IT'S EASIER TO USE HARDER TO RESTART A COP OUT LEE PROJECT. AND I THAN IT IS TO. JUST LIKE STARTED AND WE A FEW MORE YEARS I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE WITH THIS PROPOSAL. ALSO I'M SURE. SOMEWHERE IN THE SYSTEM IF CAPACITY REALLY SHOWS THAT WE DON'T HAVE A NEED ANYMORE I'M SURE THERE ARE OTHER BEDS IN THE NORTH THAT WE CAN. ISN'T DE COMMISSIONER WE CAN I KNOW WE CAN TAKE DOWN YEAH WE CAN TAKE DOWN VETS IN THE NORTH'S THAT WE HAVE AN OFFENSE IN THE SOUTH. OKAY AND BY TAKING DOWNLOAD BE SHIFTING THEM FROM A MENTAL HEALTH PURPOSE TO A MEDICAL PURPOSE BECAUSE OFTEN IN A BUILDING THAT SHARES BOTH OF THOSE PROGRAMS OKAY. HOW MUCH IS THAT BUT PRIVATE PAY THIS FAR IN FINES AS A RESULT OF THIS COURT ORDER DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA? YEAH I CAN ADDRESS THAT. AT THIS POINT THE COURT HAS IN FACT NOT OF LEVY THOSE FINDS OUT SHE HAS THREATENED THEM AND. THE ORDER FROM MARCH OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN REQUIRED THAT WE COME INTO COMPLIANCE BY MAY FIFTEENTH OF TWENTY SIX PASSED SEVENTEEN. I UNFORTUNATELY WE WERE NOT IN COMPLIANCE AT THAT TIME. AND OUR ESTIMATE TO DATE IS THAT WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FINES. BUILT. IN TODAY WAITING OTHER REASON SHE HAS NOT YET PULL THE TRIGGER ON ANY ACTUAL. ORDER ON THE FINES IS BECAUSE WE HAVE. APPEALED THAT WATER. WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE BRIEFING PROCESS NOW AND IT WHILE THERE'S NO STAY ON THE ORDER ITSELF. SHE HAS NOT LEVY DEFINES I THINK IS A FUNCTION OF THE US APPEAL. OKAY SOUNDS GOOD CURRENT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT COVERS ITEM SEVEN EIGHT AND NINE AND THEY WILL ALSO BE HELD OPEN. UP FOR ADDITIONAL CONVERSATION IF THERE IS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT WE NEED TO GET PLEASE LET US HAVE INFORMATION CONCERNING THE NEEDS FOR THOSE PETS. WHAT ITEM NUMBER TEN? WHICH IS A MEDICAL DISTRIBUTION IMPROVEMENTS FACE TO. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. MEDICATION DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES HAVE BEEN NEWLY CONSTRUCTED OR RENOVATED AT MOST CDC OUR PRESENCE OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS AS PART OF OUR HEALTH CARE RELATED CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM THAT'S BEEN ONGOING. THESE FACILITIES RANGE FROM ROOMS ADJACENT TO MEDICAL CLINICS WHERE MEDICATIONS ARE PREPARED AND DISTRIBUTED TO ALL THE INMATES HOUSE ON A GIVEN PRISON YARD THAT ARE SERVED BY THE CLINIC. BUT ALSO INCLUDES ROOMS WITHIN HOUSING UNITS AT HOW SPECIALIZED. POPULATIONS OWN ADMINISTRATIVE SEGREGATION HOUSING UNIT THE INMATES ARE PROVIDED THEIR MEDICATIONS AT THE SELF FRONT. OR AN ENHANCED NO PATIENT PROGRAMMABLE HEALTH UNIT WHERE THEY ARE PROVIDED THEIR MEDICATIONS AND WINDOWS HAD BEEN CONSTRUCTED IN THE DAY ROOM. THE PROPOSAL BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE REQUESTS APPROXIMATELY THREE POINT THREE MILLION TO BEGIN A DESIGN FOR A FACE TO OF THESE MEDICATION. DISTRIBUTION IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS. AND THIS WOULD AFFECT ABOUT FOURTEEN PRISONS. THERE ARE THREE GENERAL REASONS WHY A PROJECT IS INCLUDED IN THIS. IN THE SPACE TO A PROJECT. FOUR EIGHT OF THESE PRISONS. MEDICATION CORPORATION ROOMS AT ADMINISTRATIVE SEGREGATION UNITS WERE ERRONEOUSLY OMITTED FROM PHASE ONE OF THE PROGRAM THEY WERE JUST THEY WERE DISMISSED SO THIS IS DOING THE SAME THING AT THOSE EIGHT PRISONS. THAT OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE SEGREGATION UNITS I HAVE HAD CONSTRUCTED. AT SIX PRISON CDC ARE HAS EXPANDED THE ENHANCED AL PATIENT PROGRAM MIDDLE HEALTH PROGRAM. AT THOSE PRISONS INTO ADDITIONAL A HOUSING UNITS SO WE WOULD. BE REQUESTING THEM FUNDING TO BUILD MEDICATION JUST REFER OPENSIN THOSE HOUSING UNITS. AND THEN FINALLY THERE ARE PRISON FACILITIES THAT PREVIOUSLY HELD A SEGREGATED POPULATION SUCH ISSUE OR ADMINISTRATIVE SEGREGATION THAT NOW HAS BEEN CONVERTED TO GENERAL POPULATION AND SO THOSE PRISON YARDS LACK THE WINDOWS FACING THE YARD. TO PROVIDE MEDICATIONS OF THOSE INMATES INSANE NOW NO LONGER HAVE TO REQUIRE SERVICES IN THEIR HOUSING UNIT BUT CAN BE OUT ON THE ARE THEMSELVES. MEDICATION DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES THERE WOULD BE DESIGNED FOR THIS PROPOSAL ARE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE MEDICAL CARE INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THE RECEIVER'S TURNAROUND PLAN OF ACTION. AND AS IDENTIFIED THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN REQUESTED BY THE COMMITTEE AND THE LA OVER GUARDING THE POPULATIONS ALL BE SERVED BY THESE IMPROVEMENTS. WELL THIS ITEM IS BEING PLACED ON HOLD WE PLEDGED CONTINUE WORKING WITH THAT BOTH ENTITIES TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION IN ADDRESSING THE ADDITIONAL CONCERN. ANY COMMENTS FROM FINANCE. THE LEO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AT AS THE DEPARTMENT MENTIONED IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE NEED FOR THESE PROJECTS WE DID REQUEST ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT WOULD OUTLINE. HOW MANY INMATES COULD BE SERVED WITH THE PHASE ONE PROJECTS THAT ARE ALREADY UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND HOW MANY AND WHAT TYPES OF INMATES COULD BE SERVED WITH THOSE PROJECTS? WITH THAT INFORMATION THE LEGISLATURE WILL BE IN A BETTER POSITION TO EVALUATE WHETHER ALL OF THESE PROJECTS ARE NEEDED TO SERVE. THE POPULATION AS IT'S PROJECTED TO CHANGE OVER TIME SO PINNING RECEIPT OF THAT INFORMATION A WE RECOMMEND WITH HOLDING ACTION ON THIS ITEM. SPECIFIC TO THE PROPOSAL'S MENTION THAT CONVERT DIDN'T EXCUSE ME CHIU SECURITY HOUSING UNITS INTO GENERAL POPULATION UNITS WE RECOMMEND DIRECTING THE DEPARTMENT TO SUBMIT REVISED PROPOSAL SPECIFIC TO THOSE. I REQUEST AS THOSE APPEAR NECESSARY EVEN WET ONCE WE GET THE INFORMATION THAT'S BEEN REQUESTED. OKAY. ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS BY. MEMBERS. OKAY ANY COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC. OKAY. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHEN THAT THE INFORMATION WILL BE FORTHCOMING WITH THE GUYS WHAT ELIOT WAS REQUESTING IN TERMS OF. HOW MANY PERSONS WOULD BE SERVED BY PHASE ONE OF THE PROJECT? I I THINK THAT. EARLY TO MID APRIL WILL BE ABLE TO MEET AND TALK ABOUT IT A PART OF THE ISSUE IS THAT THEY. THE BILL IF YOU TO SERVE ISN'T NECESSARILY QUANTIFIED BY NUMBER OF PEOPLE. IN ALL CASES SO IT'S MORE A QUESTION OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF POPULATIONS IN THE NEED. FOR THOSE PROGRAMS SO IT'S AYE IF IT WAS. SIMPLE NUMBERS I HAVE IT IN THEIR HANDS ALREADY. BUT WE'RE WORKING ON IT AND AND BY EARLY APRIL I THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET SOMETHING WE SHOULD HAVE THAT BEFORE MAY REVISE ABSOLUTELY ALRIGHT SOUNDS GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WOULD NOT ITEM ELEVEN. WITH THE HELP ACCESS VEHICLES GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR A NUMBER. ISSUE NUMBER ELEVEN INVOLVES. REQUEST ON BEHALF OF THE APARTMENT FOR SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME FINDING. AYE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. TO REPLACE SEVERAL. HIGH PRIORITY HEALTHCARE ACCESS VEHICLES. MOST OF WHICH ARE REPLACEMENT OF EXISTING VEHICLES AND THEN. HAVE FORTY SEVEN ADDITIONAL VEHICLES WERE PROPOSING TO ADD TO OUR FLEET. AS IS MENTIONED IN FINANCES A PAGES IN ADDITION TO THIS PROPOSAL THE DEPARTMENT IS WORKING WITH CITIES YES CURRENTLY TO ADDRESS OUR FLEET NEEDS MORE GLOBALLY. BUT PAT THE DEPARTMENT IDENTIFIED THIS AS THE BAY AREA MOST IN NEED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SO THIS IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO ADDRESS RIGHT NOW. I'M JOINED BY DEVIN FONG WHO IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF OUR OFFICE OF BUSINESS SERVICES HIS CAN PROVIDE YOU JUST A LITTLE MORE DETAIL ON THEM WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. PICTURE GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. SO ON OCTOBER TWENTY SIXTH TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. THE RECEIVER DELEGATED AUTHORITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR FLEET OVERSIGHT MANAGEMENT TO CDC ARE SO WE'VE BEEN OVER SAYING. HEALTHCARE ACCESS VEHICLES EVER SINCE THAT TIME. SO THIS AS JASON JASON MENTIONED THIS PROPOSAL REQUEST FOURTEEN POINT SIX MILLION. IN REPLACEMENTS TWO POINT NINE MILLION FOR ADDITIONAL ASSETS IDENTIFIED. IN THE RECEIVER'S OPERATIONS MONITORING AUDITS. SO WHAT WERE. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO WITH WHAT THIS FUNDING IS REPLACE? THE HEALTHCARE ACCESS VEHICLES IN GREATEST NEED OF REPLACEMENT ONE GREATEST NEED IF IF YOU WILL. SO AS PART OF THAT IS WE WOULD HAVE TO CREATE A FLEA ACQUISITION PLAN. PERSONAL TO STATE ADMINISTRATIVE MANUAL UPDATED APPROVED BY DE JUST SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN PROCUREMENTS. PART OF WHAT WE'RE DOING. INTERNALLY AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THE ABILITY TO REDIRECT OR REPLACE. VEHICLES. THAT COULD BE REPURPOSE THAT ARE NON EIGHT CA ESOS PART OF THAT ANALYSIS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. CURRENTLY IS BASICALLY THREE THINGS THIS ISN'T AN UPGRADE RIGHT SO WE HAVE TO DO A LOT ABOUT REACH. THIS IS THE VEHICLE IN BETTER CONDITION. TO ACTUALLY MOVE IT DOESN'T MEET OPERATIONAL NEED WILL WE. CAN WE PERFORM THE SAME TYPES OF DUTIES WITH THIS OTHER TYPE OF VEHICLE AND WILL DE JUST APPROVE IT AS A DISSIMILAR ASSETS SO THAT'S. YOU KNOW ANOTHER FACTOR TO KEEP IN MIND AND IS A COST EFFECTIVE DO WE HAVE TO PROVIDE. SECURITY MODIFICATIONS ON OR DO WE HAVE TO HAVE IT REMOVED SIR THE QUITE A BIT OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THOSE THINGS. AND AS WE DEVELOP THE FLEET ACQUISITION PLAN WE'RE COMMITTED TO DOING THAT AS WELL. COULD. SO. THEN THE NEXT PART WOULD BE DEVELOPED THE FLEET OPPOSITION PROCESS AND THAT WE WOULD. PLAN. AND THEY WILL WORK WITH AND COLLABORATE WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS THE RECEIVERS OFFICE AND. TDC ARE ADULT INSTITUTIONS DIVISIONS TO SEE IF THE THINGS MAKE SENSE PRESENT THOSE TO THE UNDERSECRETARIES AND THAT ULTIMATELY PRESENT THE FLEET ACQUISITION PLAN TO BEGIN PROCUREMENTS TO. TGS. OKAY ANY COMMENTS FROM FINANCE. BELIAU. WELL WE DON'T RAISE CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL TO PURCHASE NEW VEHICLES HOWEVER WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT TO REPORT ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT COULD. REPURPOSE OTHER TWO HUNDRED NINETY ONE VEHICLES THAT ARE PROPOSED FOR REPLACEMENT. TO THE RATHER THAN DISPOSING OF THEM ARE AUCTIONING THEM AND WE. WE APPRECIATE THE DEPARTMENT IS LOOKING INTO THIS POSSIBILITY HOWEVER WE RECOMMEND THAT THE DEPARTMENT THAT ARE THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT TO RIP IT REPORT. WHEN THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. WHETHER IT WILL INDEED BE ABLE TO REPURPOSE ANY OF THOSE VEHICLES SOUNDS REASONABLE OKAY. ALRIGHT ANY OTHER CAUSE COMMENTS QUESTIONS. HE COMES FROM THE PUBLIC. SO WE ASSUME THAT YOU'VE HEARD ELIAS'S CONCERN AND THAT WE'LL HEAR FROM. A. HEAR FROM YOU WOULD REGARDING THAT WE'RE TO RE PURPOSING THOSE ITEMS OR HOW MUCH CAN OR CANNOT BE USED BEFORE WE DO WHATEVER. WE CAN DO WITH THEM. WE'VE HEARD IT SEVERAL TIMES NOW YEAH OKAY SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN SO WILL YOU THAT BEFORE THEY MAY REVISE. OUR LAST AND FINAL ITEM IS A VIDEO SURVEILLANCE OF MENTAL HEALTH UNITS CALIFORNIA STATE PRISONS AND. OKAY OKAY. WITH THIS PROPOSAL THE DEPARTMENT REQUESTS ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS HIGH IN BUDGET YEAR HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ON GOING AFTER. TO. INSTALL AND MONITOR. SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM WITHIN OUR CSP SACRAMENTO. FACILITY AND MATT MENTAL HEALTH UNIT SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS PROPOSAL I'M JOINED BY MISTER REST NICHOLS WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF OUR. ENTERPRISE INFORMATION SYSTEMS OFFICE EYES GREW WIDE YOU LITTLE MORE DETAIL ON THEM WILL ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. GOOD. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS WITH THE DRAMATIC INCREASES IN TECHNOLOGY CAPABILITIES AND REDUCTIONS IN COST LOT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE IMPLEMENTED VIDEO RECORDING SYSTEMS. HELPED INVESTIGATIVE PROCESSES AND SO THE AND SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES TRANSPARENCY OF ALL OF THE ACT. ACTIVITIES THAT GO ON. WITH THAT IN MIND ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO WE STARTED A PILOT EFFORT TO TWO OF OUR PRISONS HIGH DESERT STATE PRISON UP IN SUSANVILLE CCW AT THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THOSE IMPLEMENTATIONS WILL BE COMPLETED THIS SPRING WE'VE ALSO ENGAGE UC IRVINE TO HELP US QUANTIFY. THE IMPACTS OF THOSE VIDEO SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS THIS PROPOSAL THOUGH IS IS ABOVE AND BEYOND THE SCOPE IN THE INTENT OF THE THE PILOT IMPLEMENTATIONS. SPECIFICALLY IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE COLEMAN SPECIAL MASTER. ISSUED SOME SOME INFORMATION TO ASK SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO SEE SP SACRAMENTO AND THE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ALLEGATIONS. STAFF AND SOME OTHER INMATES. RELATED TO THE MENTAL HEALTH POPULATION AT CSP SACRAMENTO. SO IT'S OUR INTENT TO BRING IN A VIDEO SO. SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM THAT CAN HELP TO EITHER QUALIFY OR REBUT THE OUT THE SECURE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ALLOCATE. ALLEGATIONS AND TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING NOT ONLY THE APPROPRIATE SERVICES BUT PROTECTING OUR AT RISK POPULATION THE MENTAL HEALTH. FACILITIES THAT SACRAMENTO. SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT. ANY COMES FROM LA FROM FINANCE. I MEAN I WORK PART OF FINANCES ONE ANOTHER AT THIS PROPOSAL IS SPECIFIC TO THE MENTAL HEALTH UNITS AT SAC IN ISN'T DIRECTLY. TIED TO A RELATED TO THE STATEWIDE. PILOT THAT I HE MENTION OF IT IS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED BY THE COLEMAN ASPECTS MONSTER MONITORING TEAM MUKA. NEW HELLO YES THE. AND THE EVALUATION OF THE VIDEO SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM ON THE ONE YARD AT HIGH DESERT STATE PRISON THAT'S BEING EVALUATED BY. RESEARCHERS AT UC IRVINE AYE IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY ARE LOOKING INTO ALLEGATIONS AGAINST STAFF. BY INMATES AND SO WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE WITH HOLD ACTION ON THIS PROPOSAL INTEL THAT REPORT IS AVAILABLE AND WE RECOMMEND DIRECTING THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE THAT REPORT BEFORE THE MAY REVISE. AND IN ADDITION TO REPORT ON THEIR IN THE MEANTIME ON OTHER ACT. STRATEGIES IT'S DEVELOPING TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT SACK OKAY SOUNDS GOOD. ALRIGHT ANY COMMENTS. ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS. OKAY. OF. DO YOU HAVE A RESPONSE OF THAT I MEAN I KNOW WE DID THE THE PILOT WITH THE. HIGH DESERT AND ALL THAT. AND THE RESULTS ARE NOT OUT YET I'M UNDERSTANDING ARE THEY AVAILABLE THE THEY ARE NOT AVAILABLE YET THE FINAL REPORT IS DUE TO US ARE RIGHT AT MAY FIRST. SOBRE CLOSED THE MAY REVISE. WE WE HAVE SEEN SOME INITIAL RESULTS BUT WHAT THE UC IRVINE RESEARCHERS ARE LOOKING AT REALLY IS DIFFERENT THEN THEN THE SITUATION THAT EXISTS WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH POPULATION. THAT THE ALLEGATIONS INCLUDE EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE WHICH IS SIMILAR TO HIGH DESERT BUT WITH HOLDING THE FOOD AND A LOT OF OTHER TREATMENT. THAT THE UC IRVINE REPORT REALLY WON'T ADDRESS AND THIS IS OP A. POPULATION THAT'S AT RISK AND WE BELIEVE THE VIDEO SYSTEM CAN HELP MAKE SURE THAT WHERE WE ARE DEALING WITH THOSE ALLEGATIONS AND PROVIDING APPROPRIATE SERVICES SPECIFICALLY TO THAT MENTAL HEALTH POPULATION. WHAT IS WHAT IT WOULD IS THAT WHAT OF THE VIDEOS WITH THE HIGH DESERT GROUP DOING? AND NOT LOOKING AT SOME OF THOSE THINGS WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING AT SO THEY'RE LOOKING AT YOU SUPPORTS INCIDENTS ARE A LOT OF ANY SORT OF VIOLENCE. THAT GOES ON TO SEE IF WE CAN CAPTURE THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE WE ARE. SHORTENING THE LENGTH OF INVESTIGATIONS THAT WE CAN. SUBSTANTIATE CLAIMS OR OR CHARGES AGAINST THE APPROPRIATE OFFENDER. AS AN EXAMPLE OFTENTIMES OF TWO INMATES ARE TO FIGHT BUT NOBODY SEES THAT THEY'RE BOTH CHARGED HE COULD ACTUALLY BE AN ASSAULT WHERE ONE INMATE IS A VICTIM. SO UC IRVINE IS FOCUSED MORE ON THAT SIDE OF THE THE EQUATION AND LOOKING AT THE COST BENEFIT. ENSURING THAT THERE IS A RETURN ON INVESTMENT IN INSTALLING THE SYSTEM. AT SACK WE'RE REALLY DEALING WITH THE CARE AND APPROPRIATE SERVICES TO MENTAL HEALTH INMATES THEIR VERY MUCH AT RISK IN THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE NATURE OF THE ALLEGATIONS THE SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER THERE. MAKES IT A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT THAN. THE BROADER ISSUES THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AT A HIGH DESERT AND A CCW OUT. THE OTHER PIECE THAT CCW UP THE HIGH DESERT IS WERE REALLY LOOKING AT THE TECHNOLOGY COMPONENTS HOW BEST TO USE THAT THE POLICIES OF WHO CAN LOOK AT VIDEO. HOW LONG IS THE VIDEO RETAINED AND THINGS ALONG THOSE LINES SO THERE'S A A MUCH BROADER TECHNOLOGICAL IMPACT A? AND STUDY GOING ON WITH THOSE TWO PRISONS. THAT DEAL WITH. THEY POPULATION WEALTHY ON JUST MENTAL HEALTH ASPECT. OKAY ó WELL I THINK THE INFORMATION WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR US TO HAVE. IN TERMS OF THE REPORT. IF WE'RE BUYING EIGHT EQUIPMENT I SOON. WOULD WOULD BASICALLY BY THE SAME TYPE OF EQUIPMENT EVEN THOUGH THE ANALYSIS THAT WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IN THE VIDEO MAY BE DIFFERENT. BUT. BUT I DON'T THINK THE TECHNOLOGY SHOULD CHANGE THAT MUCH IN TERMS OF NUMBER WHAT ONE SEES IN THAT ROOM AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO SEE IF THERE'S. IF IT IS ACTUALLY WORKING OF THE TECHNOLOGY IS IS A IS EFFECTIVE IN IN. AND MONITORING WHAT WE THINK WE SHOULD BE MONITORING WHAT WE END UP WITH THE RESULTS OF. DENIAL OF FOOD OR VIEWS OR SOMETHING ELSE I MEAN VIDEOS VIDEO UP CLEARLY AT WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR MAY CHANGE BUT. I ASSUME THAT THE IMAGES WILL NOT CHANGE IN TERMS OF HOW WE. ATTEMPT TO MONITOR LEASE FACILITIES I ASSUME THAT'S CORRECT NO MA'AM THERE. WHAT WE'RE LEARNING FROM HIGH DOESN'T SEE SYRUPY AFT WITH CAMERA PLACEMENT HOME ARE HOW THE RECORDINGS ARE ACCESS TELLING THEIR RETAIN ALL OF THAT WOULD BE ROLLED INTO THIS? SYSTEM AT CSP SACK THIS ONE WOULD BE PHYSICALLY SMALLER IT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE CAMERAS VERSUS A FULL IMPLEMENTATION AT A LOCATION LIKE SACRAMENTO WOULD BE CLOSER TO FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED. SO IT'S JUST THE MENTAL HEALTH AREAS MOMENT THE PS YUGIOH P. TYPE AREAS AND FOR ALL RIGHT. WHAT IT YOU KNOW I'M A REAL BIG STICKLER ABOUT DOE A STUDENT PILOTS AND AND THEN BEFORE WE FIND OUT WHAT THE PILOT SAID AS WE IMPLEMENT SUPPLEMENTALS? AND THOUGH I THINK PILOTS HAVE. A VALUE IN TEACHING US IN HELPING US TO MAKE GOOD DECISIONS APPS LA AS WELL AS BE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE AND NOT OVER DOING SOMETHING WHEN. THE PILOT BUT IT TOOK GIVEN TO SOME OF THE INFORMATION SO I THINK THE PURPOSE OF A PILOT IS ALWAYS TO LEARN I AM OPTIMISTIC THAT WE'LL GET THAT INFORMATION FOR ME. IF I MAKING ONE MORE COMMENT WE ARE ABSOLUTELY LEARNING SOME OF THOSE LESSONS ALL GOODY WITH HIGH DESERT WE WILL QUALIFY THOSE WITH UC IRVINE WE'RE ACTUALLY EXPANDING THE THE. A NUMBER OF ITEMS THAT WE COLLECT AS WE'RE MOVING INTO CCW HAPPEN THE REST OF HIGH DESERT. THE SITUATION WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH INMATES AT SAC IS JUST MUCH MORE URGENT MA THAT CONTINUITY OF CARE THAT SPECIAL. TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT THAT EXISTS IN A PS YOU AND A. S. YOU AT SAC. THERE IS AN URGENCY THERE TO MAKE SURE WE ARE ACTUALLY PROTECTING THOSE THOSE INMATES AND PROVIDING THE TRANSPARENCY THAT'S NECESSARY FOR OTHER FOLKS TO VALIDATE THE. CENTER FOR ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM. THE MEMBERS. IT COMES FROM THE PUBLIC. I WANT TO THANK THE STAFF OF BEING EFFICIENT AND MOVING FORCE FORWARD RATHER QUICKLY. AND THAT COVERS THE TWELVE ITEMS THAT WE HAVE FOR TODAY ALL THOSE ITEMS WILL BE ROLLED OVER. AND UNDER AND LEFT OPEN FOR. VOTING WHEN WE GET AROUND TO VOTING AT THAT TIME ITEMS HAT WE'VE SAID WE NEED MORE INFORMATION ON OR ILLEGAL HAS SAID WE SHOULD HAVE THAT. I I AM OPTIMISTIC WE WILL GET THAT BEFORE WE HAVE TO MAKE A FINAL DECISION. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU MAY MEETING IS ADJOURNED
