AMOUNTING TO FIFTY ONE CENTS.

00:29:49.387 --> 00:29:51.156
PER GALLON. RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIA

00:29:51.222 --> 00:29:53.224
HAS BY FAR THE HIGHEST GAS

00:29:53.291 --> 00:29:55.059
PRICES IN THE COUNTRY THEY HAVE

00:29:55.126 --> 00:29:56.895

THIS GAS TAX ON THESE RECORD

HIGH GAS PRICES ARE EXTREMELY

00:30:13.945 --> 00:30:16.047
REGRESSIVE. THAT'S WHY A RECENT

00:30:16.114 --> 00:30:18.917
SURVEY SHOWED THAT 47% OF LOW

00:30:18.983 --> 00:30:20.618
INCOME CALIFORNIANS SAID THAT

00:30:20.685 --> 00:30:23.821
THE RISE IN FUEL COSTS IS POSING

00:30:23.888 --> 00:30:26.024
A SERIOUS FINANCIAL HARDSHIP. IF

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:27.559
YOU'RE SOMEONE WHO HAS TO

00:30:27.625 --> 00:30:29.260
COMMUTE A LONG DISTANCE TO WORK

00:30:29.327 --> 00:30:31.329
OR MAYBE YOU HAVE KIDS YOU NEED

00:30:31.396 --> 00:30:33.398
TO DRIVE TO SCHOOL OR OTHER

00:30:33.464 --> 00:30:34.866

00:30:34.933 --> 00:30:36.134
RURAL AREA. WHERE THERE ISN'T

00:30:36.201 --> 00:30:38.269
EASY ACCESS TO PUBLIC TRANSPORT

00:30:38.336 --> 00:30:40.271
THEN THIS POSES EVEN MORE OF A

00:30:40.338 --> 00:30:42.340
HARDSHIP THE FACT IS THAT NOT

00:30:42.407 --> 00:30:44.142
EVERY CALIFORNIAN CAN AFFORD TO

00:30:44.209 --> 00:30:45.476
HAVE A TESLA DELIVERED TO THEIR

HOME TOMORROW. AND MANY

00:30:46.644 --> 00:30:47.979
CALIFORNIANS MANY OF HARD

00:30:48.046 --> 00:30:50.181
WORKING CALIFORNIANS DO NOT HAVE

00:30:50.248 --> 00:30:52.283
ALTERNATIVES TO DRIVING THEY

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:54.118
HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO BEAR THESE

00:30:54.185 --> 00:30:55.453
COSTS AND TO PAY MORE AND MORE

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:58.523

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:00.825
THIS BILL PRESENTS A VERY SIMPLE

00:31:00.892 --> 00:31:03.027
SOLUTION. IT IS A LOVER OF THAT

00:31:03.094 --> 00:31:04.996
WE CAN PULL IMMEDIATELY IT HAS

00:31:05.063 --> 00:31:06.564
URGENCY BECAUSE IT WILL TAKE

00:31:06.631 --> 00:31:08.933
EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. IN ORDER TO

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.269
PROVIDE FOLKS WITH SOME MEASURE

00:31:11.336 --> 00:31:13.571
OF RELIEF. FIFTY ONE CENTS A

00:31:13.638 --> 00:31:15.340
GALLON WILL NOT BRING GAS PRICES

00:31:15.406 --> 00:31:17.008
IN CALIFORNIA DOWN TO REASONABLE

00:31:17.075 --> 00:31:19.277
LEVELS BUT IT WILL HELP MILLIONS

00:31:19.344 --> 00:31:20.878
OF PEOPLE AND IT'S SOMETHING

00:31:20.945 --> 00:31:23.348
THAT WE CAN DO RIGHT NOW. SIMPLY

00:31:23.414 --> 00:31:25.183
BY PASSING THIS BILL. NOW I WANT

OBJECTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED THIS

00:31:30.255 --> 00:31:33.024
BILL. THE FIRST IS THAT SOMEHOW

00:31:33.091 --> 00:31:34.993
CUTTING THE STATE'S GAS TAX WILL

00:31:35.059 --> 00:31:36.794

00:31:36.861 --> 00:31:39.163
CONSUMERS THIS NOTION HAS BEEN

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:41.199
THOROUGHLY DEBUNKED. THE

00:31:41.266 --> 00:31:43.201
NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC

00:31:43.268 --> 00:31:45.336
RESEARCH FOUND A COMPLETE PASS

00:31:45.403 --> 00:31:46.638
THROUGH OF BOTH FEDERAL AND

00:31:46.704 --> 00:31:48.606
STATE DIESEL AND GASOLINE TAXES

00:31:48.673 --> 00:31:51.809
TO CONSUMERS. MOREOVER ARE ONLY

00:31:51.876 --> 00:31:53.811
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE HAS

00:31:53.878 --> 00:31:55.747
FOUND THAT MOST OF THE CHANGE IN

00:31:55.813 --> 00:31:56.781
THE TAX RATE LIKELY WILL BE

00:31:56.848 --> 00:31:58.650
PASSED THROUGH THE PRICES AT THE

00:31:58.716 --> 00:32:01.419
PUMP. BUT WE DON'T ACTUALLY NEED

00:32:01.486 --> 00:32:03.388
TO LOOK AT STUDIES OR ANALYSTS

00:32:03.454 --> 00:32:04.656
WE CAN SIMPLY LOOK AT WHAT'S

00:32:04.722 --> 00:32:06.624
HAPPENING IN THE WORLD. OTHER

00:32:06.691 --> 00:32:08.226
STATES LIKE MARYLAND AND GEORGIA

00:32:08.293 --> 00:32:10.061
CHOSE TO SUSPEND THEIR STATE GAS

00:32:10.128 --> 00:32:12.263
TAX AND THEY SOUGHT AN IMMEDIATE

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:14.999
REDUCTION IN THE PRICE THAT

00:32:15.066 --> 00:32:16.034
CONSUMERS WERE PAYING AT THE

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:20.071
PUMP. THE SECOND OBJECTION. IS

00:32:20.138 --> 00:32:21.939
THAT THIS WILL RESULT IN A LOSS

00:32:22.006 --> 00:32:24.042
OF FUNDING FOR ROADS. FROM THE

00:32:24.108 --> 00:32:25.877
PLAIN TEXT OF THE BILL THIS IS

00:32:25.943 --> 00:32:28.112
CLEARLY FALSE. THE BILL WOULD

00:32:28.179 --> 00:32:30.081
BACK FILL ANY LOSS OF FUNDING

00:32:30.148 --> 00:32:31.582
FOR ROADS OUT OF THE STATE'S

00:32:31.649 --> 00:32:33.084
GENERAL FUND AND LET'S REMEMBER

00:32:33.151 --> 00:32:34.585
THAT WE HAVE A VERY LARGE

00:32:34.652 --> 00:32:36.888
SURPLUS. RIGHT NOW. FINALLY I

00:32:36.954 --> 00:32:38.923
WANT TO ADDRESS THESE VARIOUS

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:41.326
REBATE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:32:41.392 --> 00:32:43.127
OFFERED BUT BY MEMBERS OF THIS

00:32:43.194 --> 00:32:44.462
LEGISLATURE. AND BY THE

00:32:44.529 --> 00:32:46.097
GOVERNOR. I THINK THAT REBATES

00:32:46.164 --> 00:32:47.832
ARE A GOOD IDEA IN FACT I THINK

00:32:47.899 --> 00:32:49.567
WHEN THERE'S A SURPLUS THIS

00:32:49.634 --> 00:32:51.402
SHOULD BE PRETTY MUCH AUTOMATIC.

00:32:51.469 --> 00:32:53.037
WE SHOULD GIVE THE MONEY BACK TO

00:32:53.104 --> 00:32:55.073
THE FOLKS THAT WE GOT IT FROM. I

00:32:55.139 --> 00:32:56.240
THINK THAT WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED

00:32:56.307 --> 00:32:58.309
SHOULD ACTUALLY BE MUCH MORE

00:32:58.376 --> 00:32:59.977
SIGNIFICANT I THINK IT SHOULD BE

00:33:00.044 --> 00:33:01.546
PERMANENT I AM READY AND WILLING

00:33:01.612 --> 00:33:03.581
AND EAGER. TO WORK WITH THE

00:33:03.648 --> 00:33:05.249
GOVERNOR AND MEMBERS OF THIS

00:33:05.316 --> 00:33:05.750
LEGISLATURE I'M GIVING

00:33:05.817 --> 00:33:08.619
CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE OVERTAXED

00:33:08.686 --> 00:33:10.988
SOME MUCH NEEDED TAX RELIEF. BUT

00:33:11.055 --> 00:33:12.023
THAT IS AN ENTIRELY SEPARATE

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:13.991
QUESTION. FROM WHAT TO DO ABOUT

00:33:14.058 --> 00:33:15.927
THE IMMEDIATE AND SPECIFIC

00:33:15.993 --> 00:33:16.861
PROBLEM. OF RECORD HIGH GAS

00:33:16.928 --> 00:33:19.597
PRICES. WHAT I HAVE PROPOSED IS

00:33:19.664 --> 00:33:21.566
A SPECIFIC AND IMMEDIATE

00:33:21.632 --> 00:33:23.768
SOLUTION. WHICH IS TO SUSPEND

00:33:23.835 --> 00:33:26.437
THE TAX THAT WE HAVE ON GAS

00:33:26.504 --> 00:33:28.106
WHICH IS JUST ABOUT AS HIGH AS

00:33:28.172 --> 00:33:31.409
ANY IN THE COUNTRY. THIS SHOULD

00:33:31.476 --> 00:33:33.878
NOT BE A PARTISAN ISSUE. IN

00:33:33.945 --> 00:33:35.613
CONNECTICUT FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.181
MEMBERS OF THAT LEGISLATURE

00:33:37.248 --> 00:33:39.817
UNANIMOUSLY PASSED A BILL TO

00:33:39.884 --> 00:33:41.919
SUSPEND THE STATE GAS TAX.

00:33:41.986 --> 00:33:43.388
DEMOCRATS VOTED FOR IT

00:33:43.454 --> 00:33:45.256
REPUBLICANS VOTED FOR IT. THE

00:33:45.323 --> 00:33:46.858
BILL WAS SIGNED INTO LAW BY THE

00:33:46.924 --> 00:33:50.061
VERY LIBERAL GOVERNOR ADAMANT. I

00:33:50.128 --> 00:33:51.596
CAN ASSURE YOU THAT YOUR

00:33:51.662 --> 00:33:54.532
CONSTITUENTS WILL BE GRATEFUL IF

YOU TAKE THIS STEP TODAY TO

00:33:56.634 --> 00:33:57.735

00:33:59.804 --> 00:34:01.572
A RELIEF. AND I CAN EQUALLY

00:34:01.639 --> 00:34:03.241
ASSURE YOU THAT THEY WILL BE

00:34:03.307 --> 00:34:05.343
DUMBFOUNDED IF THIS LEGISLATURE

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:07.311
AGAIN REFUSES TO TAKE THIS

00:34:07.378 --> 00:34:10.681
MODEST SIMPLE EASY AND

00:34:10.748 --> 00:34:13.217

ON US- HEARD I'VE HAD DISCUSSION

00:35:27.959 --> 00:35:28.759

HAAS SCHOOL OF BUSINESS AND

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:33.791
FACULTY DIRECTOR BANERJEE

00:36:33.858 --> 00:36:35.660
INCLUDED HOSTAGE I JUST HAVE A

00:36:35.726 --> 00:36:37.562
COUPLE OF COMMENTS SINCE I ONLY

00:36:37.628 --> 00:36:39.730
A FEW MINUTES ONE IS WITH ALL

00:36:39.797 --> 00:36:41.332
DUE RESPECT TO ASSEMBLY MEN

00:36:41.399 --> 00:36:44.168
KILEY THE STUDIES THAT SHOW FULL

00:36:44.235 --> 00:36:45.036
PASSED THROUGH AND I'VE DONE ONE

00:36:45.102 --> 00:36:48.105
OF THEM- ARE WERE NOT DONE AT A

00:36:48.172 --> 00:36:50.207
TIME WHEN THERE WAS SCARCITY. OF

00:36:50.274 --> 00:36:53.344
CAPACITY TO PRODUCE GASOLINE AS

00:36:53.411 --> 00:36:55.212
THERE SEEMS TO BE IN CALIFORNIA

00:36:55.279 --> 00:36:56.948
RIGHT NOW ALIFORNIA SPOT PRICES

00:36:57.014 --> 00:36:58.649
ARE WELL ABOVE THE REST OF THE

00:36:58.716 --> 00:37:00.718
COUNTRY AND USUALLY THERE ARE

00:37:00.785 --> 00:37:02.019
ABOUT TEN CENTS HIGHER AND THAT

00:37:02.086 --> 00:37:03.588
GIVES ME GREAT CONCERN THAT IF

00:37:03.654 --> 00:37:05.756
WE CUT THAT GAS TAX RIGHT NOW

00:37:05.823 --> 00:37:07.525
AND ECONOMIC THEORY TELLS US

00:37:07.592 --> 00:37:10.461
THIS- IT WILL NOT ALL BE PASSED

00:37:10.528 --> 00:37:12.763
THROUGH SO I AM CONCERNED. THAT

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:15.700
SOME OF THIS WOULD BE- GO TO-

00:37:15.766 --> 00:37:18.703
REFINERS AT A TIME WHEN THERE'S

00:37:18.769 --> 00:37:20.404
A SCARCITY OF REFINERY CAPACITY

00:37:20.471 --> 00:37:21.739
MY SECOND POINT I WANT TO MAKE

00:37:21.806 --> 00:37:24.342
IS THAT THIS DOESN'T ADDRESS THE

00:37:24.408 --> 00:37:26.744
ONGOING CHALLENGE OF GASOLINE

00:37:26.811 --> 00:37:28.446
PRICES IN CALIFORNIA DUE TO WHAT%

00:37:28.512 --> 00:37:29.714
I'VE CALLED THE MYSTERY GASOLINE

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:32.216
SURCHARGE WHICH IS THE EXTRA ON

00:37:32.283 --> 00:37:33.684
AVERAGE THIRTY CENTS A GALLON

00:37:33.751 --> 00:37:35.886
THAT APPEARED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN.

00:37:35.953 --> 00:37:38.255
ABOVE THE HIGHER TAXES AND

00:37:38.322 --> 00:37:40.558
ENVIRONMENTAL FEES- THAT

00:37:40.625 --> 00:37:42.059
APPEARED AFTER THE TORRANCE

00:37:42.126 --> 00:37:42.827
REFINERY AND HAS NEVER

00:37:42.893 --> 00:37:46.163
DISAPPEARED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:47.798
THAT COST CALIFORNIANS ABOUT

00:37:47.865 --> 00:37:49.967
FOUR BILLION DOLLARS SO WHETHER

00:37:50.034 --> 00:37:51.435
OR NOT THIS PASSES AND YOU

00:37:51.502 --> 00:37:53.804
REPEAL ARE SUSPEND THE GAS TAX I

00:37:53.871 --> 00:37:55.873
WOULD URGE YOU TO LAUNCH AN

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.274
INVESTIGATION WITH REAL

00:37:57.341 --> 00:38:00.978
RESOURCES AND- REAL POWER TO

00:38:01.045 --> 00:38:02.980
FIND OUT WHERE THIS EXTRA MONEY

00:38:03.047 --> 00:38:04.815
IS GOING. THAT IS COSTING

00:38:04.882 --> 00:38:07.551
CONSUMERS FAR MORE THAN BEING TO

00:38:07.618 --> 00:38:09.754
THE TRANSITORY INCREASE WE'VE

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:12.857
SEEN RECENTLY- AND ALTHOUGH I AM

00:38:12.923 --> 00:38:14.325
VERY SYMPATHETIC TO PEOPLE WHO

00:38:14.392 --> 00:38:15.893
ARE PAYING A LOT MORE FOR GAS

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.294

MANY THINGS THAT LED. WANT INTO

00:38:29.807 --> 00:38:32.143
UTILITY BILLS- I WOULD URGE THE

00:38:32.209 --> 00:38:34.378
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. TAKING

00:38:34.445 --> 00:38:36.113
SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS BACK AND

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:38.249
PAYING FOR THEM THROUGH THE

00:38:38.315 --> 00:38:39.016
STATE BUDGET AND GIVING A

00:38:39.083 --> 00:38:41.652

JUST BECAUSE THERE IS NOW THE

WAR IN UKRAINE. DOES NOT MEAN

01:03:11.888 --> 01:03:14.390
THIS IS A LONG TERM PROBLEM THE

FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY HAS

01:03:15.925 --> 01:03:17.927
HISTORICALLY ALWAYS TAKEN

01:03:17.994 --> 01:03:18.628

UNCERTAINTY. GAS PRICES ROSE

01:03:21.197 --> 01:03:22.265

YOU KNOW THE THING THAT I GET

THIS LINE IT'S TOLD TO CONSUMERS

01:03:43.252 --> 01:03:45.321
THAT THE PRICE OF GAS IS HIGH

01:03:45.388 --> 01:03:46.856
BECAUSE OF GOVERNMENT. BUT THE

01:03:46.923 --> 01:03:48.891
REASON WHY WE HAVE SB ONE IN THE

01:03:48.958 --> 01:03:50.893

REALLY DON'T QUESTION. FOR SOME

01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:02.038
REASON. IS THE GREED OF

01:07:09.358 --> 01:07:10.326
TWENTY ONE BUS ROUTES IN PLASTER

01:07:10.393 --> 01:07:12.328
COUNTY AND AUBURN COUNTY AS WELL

01:07:12.395 --> 01:07:14.029
SO THIS ALSO SERVES TRANSIT

01:07:14.096 --> 01:07:15.798
RIDERS. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT

01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:17.666
BECAUSE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

01:07:17.733 --> 01:07:20.002
FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY. AS OUR

01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:21.737
PART ACROSS OUR TALKS ABOUT IS

01:07:21.804 --> 01:07:23.506
JUST BECAUSE IN THIS BILL YOU

01:07:23.572 --> 01:07:25.074
COULD BACK FILL THE GENERAL FUND

01:07:25.141 --> 01:07:26.675
WE SHOULD BE NOTED THAT. THE

01:07:26.742 --> 01:07:28.444
SURPLUS IS NOT CONSTANT IT IS

01:07:28.511 --> 01:07:32.481
NOT A SHORT. AND IF WE- OUR TO

01:07:32.548 --> 01:07:33.849
FIND OURSELVES IN IT ECONOMIC

01:07:33.916 --> 01:07:35.684
DEFICIT THE MONEY THAT GOES

01:07:35.751 --> 01:07:37.286
DIRECTLY TO CONSTITUENTS IN

01:07:37.353 --> 01:07:38.754
ROADWAYS AND TRANSPORTATION CAN

01:07:38.821 --> 01:07:40.756
EVAPORATE. AND BY DE FUNDING THE

01:07:40.823 --> 01:07:42.324
ESSENTIAL MONEY WE'RE PUTTING

01:07:42.391 --> 01:07:43.459
TOWARDS A ROADWAY IMPROVEMENTS

01:07:43.526 --> 01:07:45.494
THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE A COUPLE

01:07:45.561 --> 01:07:48.130
YEARS IS FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE.

01:07:48.197 --> 01:07:49.398
AND AGAIN LIKE A SORE WITNESSES

01:07:49.465 --> 01:07:52.067
JUST BECAUSE WE POSIT FOR SIX

01:07:52.134 --> 01:07:53.936
MONTHS IS NO GUARANTEE WE BRING

01:07:54.003 --> 01:07:56.105
IT BACK. SO YOU KNOW I

01:07:56.172 --> 01:07:57.640
DEFINITELY IT WOULD SYMPATHIZE I

01:07:57.706 --> 01:07:59.575
UNDERSTAND HOW HARD IT IS RIGHT

01:07:59.642 --> 01:08:01.777
NOW AND HOW HARD IT IS AT THE

01:08:01.844 --> 01:08:03.546
PUMP BUT THAT IS NOT BECAUSE WE

01:08:03.612 --> 01:08:04.947
ARE PAYING FOR ROADS IT'S

01:08:05.014 --> 01:08:06.081
BECAUSE THEY ARE CORPORATIONS

01:08:06.148 --> 01:08:07.850
OUT THERE. WHO ARE FRACKING THE

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:09.652

CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIANS WILL

01:17:08.357 --> 01:17:10.525
BE MUCH BETTER OFF IF WE HAVE A

01:17:10.592 --> 01:17:12.027
HEALTHY COMPETITION BETWEEN

01:17:12.094 --> 01:17:14.830

ADVANCE THIS GOAL. THERE'S BEEN

01:17:21.536 --> 01:17:22.904
A STEADY EFFORT BY SOME TO

01:17:22.971 --> 01:17:24.306
EXPAND THE NUMBER OF HYDROGEN

01:17:24.373 --> 01:17:25.874
FUELING STATIONS APPROVED AND

01:17:25.941 --> 01:17:28.210
FUNDED BY THE STATE OF

01:17:36.885 --> 01:17:38.653
SIMPLY TWO HUNDRED HYDROGEN

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:40.288
FUELING STATIONS CURRENTLY THERE

01:17:40.355 --> 01:17:41.490
ARE ONLY TWO HUNDRED HYDROGEN

01:17:41.556 --> 01:17:43.325
FUELING STATIONS THAT ARE

01:17:43.392 --> 01:17:44.359
ASSURED BY THE LEGISLATIVE

01:17:44.426 --> 01:17:48.030
MANDATE. AND BUDGET FUNDING. THE

01:17:48.096 --> 01:17:49.498
CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION HAS

01:17:49.564 --> 01:17:51.867
STATED THAT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY

01:17:51.933 --> 01:17:53.368
OF THOSE TWO HUNDRED. MAY

01:17:53.435 --> 01:17:55.137
ALREADY BE ENCUMBERED IN SOME

01:17:55.203 --> 01:17:58.440
WAY AND ONLY THIRTEEN OF THEM.

01:17:58.507 --> 01:18:00.308
CAN SERVICE MEDIUM AND HEAVY

01:18:00.375 --> 01:18:03.078
DUTY VEHICLES. AN EXPANDING

01:18:03.145 --> 01:18:05.680
DEMAND FOR HYDROGEN BY PORTS AND

01:18:05.747 --> 01:18:07.582
HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS WILL BE A

01:18:07.649 --> 01:18:09.985
VALUABLE STIMULUS FOR US TO MAKE

01:18:10.052 --> 01:18:11.887
GREEN ELECTROLYSIS HYDROGEN MORE

01:18:11.953 --> 01:18:14.890
COST EFFECTIVE. AND I THINK WE

01:18:14.956 --> 01:18:17.559
ALL RECOGNIZE THE GREEN HYDROGEN

01:18:17.626 --> 01:18:19.327
IS THE KEY FOR HYDROGEN

01:18:19.394 --> 01:18:21.897
TECHNOLOGY TO BECOME TRULY A

01:18:21.963 --> 01:18:23.498
COMPETITIVE FUEL ALTERNATIVE

01:18:23.565 --> 01:18:25.333

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:28.170
FOSSIL FUELS. CONTENTIONS THAT

01:18:28.236 --> 01:18:29.938
LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES CANNOT

01:18:30.005 --> 01:18:31.606
SAFELY FUEL ITS STATIONS THAT

01:18:31.673 --> 01:18:33.942
SERVICE HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS IS

01:18:34.009 --> 01:18:36.278
SIMPLY NOT ACCURATE. DIESEL

TEN YEARS. THERE IS BROAD

01:18:49.858 --> 01:18:51.093
CONSENSUS IN THE SCIENTIFIC

01:18:51.159 --> 01:18:52.994
COMMUNITY THAT HYDROGEN HAS MANY

SHIPPING. EVERY DUTY TRANSPORT

01:18:57.933 --> 01:18:59.868
AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCKING THIS

01:18:59.935 --> 01:19:01.536
BILL DOES NOT DOWNGRADE THE

01:19:01.603 --> 01:19:03.338
EFFORT FOR LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES

01:19:03.405 --> 01:19:04.906
IT'S AN ATTEMPT TO BE SURE THAT

01:19:04.973 --> 01:19:06.942
WE GET THE MAXIMUM VALUE FROM

01:19:07.008 --> 01:19:08.410
THE TAXPAYERS INVESTMENT IN

01:19:08.477 --> 01:19:10.645

GOALS AND WE CAN'T BE DOING THAT

01:29:27.795 --> 01:29:28.930
IF WE CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION

CAME OUT LIGHT DUTY OF COVERED

01:29:30.832 --> 01:29:32.366
FOR HYDROGEN REFUELING I'M A

AND I'M TELLING YOU THE ACCESS

01:29:37.638 --> 01:29:38.940
TO STATIONS IS CRITICAL FOR

01:29:39.006 --> 01:29:40.808
LIGHT DUTY DRIVERS. THE IDEA

01:29:40.875 --> 01:29:43.211
THAT HEAVY DUTY THE ONLY STATE

01:29:43.277 --> 01:29:45.313
WITH HYDROGEN IS THAT CORRECT

01:29:45.379 --> 01:29:46.614
ALTHOUGH WE HAVE MEMBERS IN

01:29:46.681 --> 01:29:48.750
HEAVY DUTY THAT WE FULLY SUPPORT

01:29:48.816 --> 01:29:49.984
FUNDING FOR HEAVY DUTY STATION

01:29:50.051 --> 01:29:51.753
BUT THE VERY SEPARATE POCKET

01:29:51.819 --> 01:29:52.987
THAT NEEDS TO REMAIN FUNDED AND

01:29:53.054 --> 01:29:54.021
FUNDED WITH PARITY AT THE

01:29:54.088 --> 01:29:55.456
COMPARED TO BATTERY ELECTRIC

01:29:55.523 --> 01:29:58.025
VEHICLES ON THE LIGHT DUTY SIDE

01:29:58.092 --> 01:29:58.993
IT IS THERE'S NO PARITY WITH

01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:00.962
BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLE. THAT'S

01:30:01.028 --> 01:30:02.563
CHARGING THEIR VEHICLES ON THE

01:30:02.630 --> 01:30:03.998
GRID AND THE GREATEST ON AVERAGE

01:30:04.065 --> 01:30:06.601
ONLY 33% RENEWABLE WHERE YOU

01:30:06.667 --> 01:30:08.169
LOOK AT ALL THE HYDROGEN FUELING

01:30:08.236 --> 01:30:09.537
STATIONS AVAILABLE MAJORITY ARE

01:30:09.604 --> 01:30:11.305
AVAILABLE TO LOW CARBON FUEL

01:30:11.372 --> 01:30:12.940
STANDARD FUND WHICH REQUIRES

01:30:13.007 --> 01:30:14.709
THEM TO BE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE

01:30:14.776 --> 01:30:16.410
OF RENEWABLE FUELAND MAJORITY

01:30:16.477 --> 01:30:18.546
OF THOSE STATIONS ARE 90%

01:30:18.613 --> 01:30:20.348
RENEWABLE OR GREATER. THE TO

01:30:20.414 --> 01:30:21.716
START GIVING FUND FOR THE

BATTERY ELECTRIFIED FOR LIGHT

01:30:22.650 --> 01:30:24.819
DUTY VEHICLES WERE ON AVERAGE IS

01:30:24.886 --> 01:30:26.554
ONLY 33% RENEWABLE WILL REALLY

01:30:26.621 --> 01:30:28.189
NOT BEATING OUR DECARBONISATION

01:30:28.256 --> 01:30:30.124
AIR QUALITY GOALS THE DISCUSSION

01:30:30.191 --> 01:30:31.726
SAYING BUT LIKE IF HE IS FUNDED

01:30:31.793 --> 01:30:33.895
IS NOT CORRECT CALIFORNIANS NEED

01:30:33.961 --> 01:30:35.429
ANOTHER OPTION FOR THEIR MISSION

MADAM CHAIR. I THINK THIS IS A

01:35:57.618 --> 01:36:01.422
QUESTION FOR. THE OPPOSITION I

01:36:01.489 --> 01:36:03.224
SHARE THE CONCERN THAT WE ARE

01:36:03.290 --> 01:36:05.159
UNDER FUNDING HYDROGEN

01:36:05.226 --> 01:36:06.861
INFRASTRUCTURE RELATIVE TO OTHER

01:36:06.927 --> 01:36:08.662
FORMS OF ZERO EMISSIONS

01:36:08.729 --> 01:36:11.899
VEHICLES- I THINK HYDROGEN HAS

01:36:11.966 --> 01:36:13.968
TO BE PART OF THE ANSWER

01:36:14.034 --> 01:36:15.336
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE TALKING

01:36:15.402 --> 01:36:18.038
ABOUT. POLLING THINGS HEAVY

01:36:18.105 --> 01:36:20.541
PAYLOADS SHIPPING SIMPLY BECAUSE

01:36:20.608 --> 01:36:21.775
THE WEIGHT OF THE BATTERIES FOR

01:36:21.842 --> 01:36:24.011
EV'S BECOMES OF. ENGINEERING

01:36:24.078 --> 01:36:26.547
PROBLEM RIGHT. SO I'M I TOTALLY

01:36:26.614 --> 01:36:28.516
GET THE WILL OR NOT FUNDING THIS

01:36:28.582 --> 01:36:29.984
WELL ENOUGH AND THE AUTHOR PUT

01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:31.719
IT WELL WHEN HE SAID WE HAVE A

01:36:31.785 --> 01:36:33.754
CHECK OR A PROBLEM I THINK

01:36:33.821 --> 01:36:35.156
THAT'S RIGHT. BUT AS I

01:36:35.222 --> 01:36:36.790
UNDERSTAND THIS BILL. THIS IS

01:36:36.857 --> 01:36:38.692
SAYING OKAY WE'VE GOT A- GIVEN

01:36:38.759 --> 01:36:40.895
PART OF MONEY THAT'S FINITE. AND

01:36:40.961 --> 01:36:42.963
WE'RE GOING TO PRIORITIZE A TO

01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:45.399
PROJECTS. LOCATED AT PORTS WHICH

01:36:45.466 --> 01:36:47.201
MAKES SENSE BECAUSE YOU GOT A

01:36:47.268 --> 01:36:49.270
SHIP. IN THE INLAND FROM A PORT.

01:36:49.336 --> 01:36:51.839
OF FUELING STATIONS THAT SERVE

01:36:51.906 --> 01:36:53.140
MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS

01:36:53.207 --> 01:36:54.975
WHICH MAKES SENSE BECAUSE THAT'S

01:36:55.042 --> 01:36:55.976
WERE HYDROGENS THE MOST.

01:36:56.043 --> 01:36:58.913
EFFICACIOUS AND PROJECTS ALONG

01:36:58.979 --> 01:37:00.514
FEDERALLY DESIGNATED OR STATE

01:37:00.581 --> 01:37:02.616
DESIGNATED. OF GOODS MOVEMENT

01:37:02.683 --> 01:37:04.618
HIGHWAYS WHICH MAKES SENSE TO ME

01:37:04.685 --> 01:37:07.521
AS WELL SO I GUESS MY QUESTION

01:37:07.588 --> 01:37:11.025
FOR YOU IS. WHAT WHAT'S YOUR

01:37:11.091 --> 01:37:13.294
PROBLEM WITH ASKING TO

01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:14.962
PRIORITIZE THINGS AND IN THAT

01:37:15.029 --> 01:37:16.263
WAY IT SEEMS LIKE A LOGICAL

01:37:16.330 --> 01:37:18.032
SEQUENCE TO ME GIVEN WE HAVE

01:37:18.098 --> 01:37:19.800
THIS FINITE CONCERN OR IT'S

01:37:19.867 --> 01:37:22.169
PERFECTLY VALID ANSWER THAT WE

01:37:22.236 --> 01:37:22.803
JUST NEED MORE MONEY GOING INTO

01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:24.438
HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE. A

01:37:24.505 --> 01:37:26.941
STATEMENT WITH WHICH I AGREE

01:37:27.007 --> 01:37:28.175
WHOLEHEARTEDLY. THAT'S A GOOD

01:37:28.242 --> 01:37:29.944
QUESTION ASSEMBLY MAN I THINK

01:37:30.010 --> 01:37:31.979
IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH- YOU

01:37:32.046 --> 01:37:35.182
KNOW THREE POINT 7% OF FUNDING

01:37:35.249 --> 01:37:36.917
BEING DIRECTED TOWARD HYDROGEN

01:37:36.984 --> 01:37:38.752
AND THIS MOM AND I'M TRYING TO

01:37:38.819 --> 01:37:39.820
FIND FUEL ECONOMY AND WITH

01:37:39.887 --> 01:37:41.855
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING- IN

01:37:41.922 --> 01:37:43.657
EUROPE AND OURS THEIR MISSION

01:37:43.724 --> 01:37:45.726
VEHICLE SEEMS A LITTLE. ABSURD

01:37:45.793 --> 01:37:48.062
SO I DO THINK THERE IS A NEED TO

01:37:48.128 --> 01:37:50.698
REALLY TRY TO LOOK AT WIDE ARE

01:37:50.764 --> 01:37:52.700
FUNDING PERCENTAGES ARE. BUT

01:37:52.766 --> 01:37:54.969
THEN ALSO I WILL SAY THAT I'D AS

01:37:55.035 --> 01:37:56.670
IT RELATES TO THE LIGHT DUTY

01:37:56.737 --> 01:37:58.806
MARKET YOU HAVE AT LEAST THREE

01:37:58.872 --> 01:38:00.341
OF THE BIGGEST NAMES VEHICLE

01:38:00.407 --> 01:38:01.675
MANUFACTURERS WITH

01:38:01.742 --> 01:38:03.577
COMMERCIALIZED VEHICLES FOR SALE

01:38:03.644 --> 01:38:05.112
ON THE ROAD NOW AND WE DON'T

01:38:05.179 --> 01:38:06.680
WANT TO PULL THE RUG OUT FROM

01:38:06.747 --> 01:38:07.681
UNDERNEATH THEM IN AN

01:38:07.748 --> 01:38:09.750
EXPECTATION. OF A STATE WIDE

01:38:09.817 --> 01:38:10.985
FUELING NETWORK THEY CAN SERVICE

01:38:11.051 --> 01:38:13.053
THOSE VEHICLES. SECOND THING

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:14.588
THAT I WOULD OFFER THAT I THINK

01:38:14.655 --> 01:38:15.656
SOMETIMES GETS LOST IN THIS

01:38:15.723 --> 01:38:17.258
SPACE IS WHAT HAPPENS WITH

01:38:17.324 --> 01:38:18.692
MEDIUM DUTY VEHICLE SO WE'RE

01:38:18.759 --> 01:38:20.327
TALKING ABOUT LIKE CLASS THREE

01:38:20.394 --> 01:38:21.929
TO CLASS SIX TRUCKS CONSTRUCTION

01:38:21.996 --> 01:38:24.431
WORKERS BOX TRUCKS VANS AT

01:38:24.498 --> 01:38:26.500
CETERA. THE IDEA THAT THESE

01:38:26.567 --> 01:38:29.236
VEHICLES ARE GOING TO RE FUEL AT

01:38:29.303 --> 01:38:31.739
THE PORT OR AT THE FREEWAY INNER

01:38:31.805 --> 01:38:34.241
CHANGE DOESN'T REALLY ACCURATELY

01:38:34.308 --> 01:38:36.277
OFF REFLECT WHAT MEDIUM DUTY

01:38:36.343 --> 01:38:37.811
VEHICLES ARE DOING ON THE ROAD

01:38:37.878 --> 01:38:39.647
THEY ARE IN THE COMMUNITY THEY

01:38:39.713 --> 01:38:41.181
ARE GOING TO PROJECTS THEIR

01:38:41.248 --> 01:38:42.716
REFUELLING AT THE CORNER GAS

01:38:42.783 --> 01:38:44.885
STATION THAT YOU AND I USE FOR A

01:38:44.952 --> 01:38:46.754
PASSENGER VEHICLES. AND SO

01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:48.789
YOU'VE GOT ON ONE HAND THERE

01:38:48.856 --> 01:38:49.857
RESOURCES BOARD MAKING

01:38:49.923 --> 01:38:51.392

THE AVAILABILITY OF FUELING

01:38:52.860 --> 01:38:54.928
INFRASTRUCTURE AND CALLING FOR

01:38:54.995 --> 01:38:55.829
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE

01:38:55.896 --> 01:38:57.031
REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE GOING TO

01:38:57.097 --> 01:38:58.799
DEPEND ON THESE VEHICLES WHILE

01:38:58.866 --> 01:39:00.901
AT THE SAME TIME OUR INVESTMENT

01:39:00.968 --> 01:39:02.770
IN THE FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE

01:39:02.836 --> 01:39:05.406
ITSELF. IS NOT AT ALL ON PACE

01:39:05.472 --> 01:39:07.741
WITH WHITES IN A REGULATORS ARE

01:39:07.808 --> 01:39:11.312
SAYING WILL BE AVAILABLE. THAT

01:39:11.378 --> 01:39:16.817

01:39:32.099 --> 01:39:33.801
WE SEE EYE TO EYE ON- THE

01:39:33.867 --> 01:39:35.836
EXPANSION AND DEVELOPMENT OF- A

01:39:35.903 --> 01:39:37.604
GREEN HYDROGEN IN THE STATE IT'S

01:39:37.671 --> 01:39:40.808
AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT- PRIORITY

01:39:40.874 --> 01:39:43.410
WE ARE- HOPEFULLY MOVING FORWARD

01:39:43.477 --> 01:39:45.312
ON SOME OF THAT- FUNDING FOR

01:39:45.379 --> 01:39:47.081
GREEN HYDROGEN IN THE BUDGET-

01:39:47.147 --> 01:39:49.016
THIS YEAR- BUT WE REALLY COULD

01:39:49.083 --> 01:39:51.352
USE A LOT MORE THAN OTHER PLACES

01:39:51.418 --> 01:39:52.953
IN THE WORLD I THINK OR JUMPING

01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:56.056
AHEAD OF US. OFF ON THAT- I ALSO

01:39:56.123 --> 01:39:58.726
SUPPORT THE GOAL OF EXPANDING

01:39:58.792 --> 01:40:00.661
MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY- A

01:40:00.728 --> 01:40:02.229
HYDROGEN VEHICLES AND THEIR

01:40:02.296 --> 01:40:05.199
ACCESS TO FUEL- I THINK THAT'S

01:40:05.265 --> 01:40:07.434
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BUT MIKE MY

01:40:07.501 --> 01:40:08.869
CONCERN WITH THE BILL AND THE

01:40:08.936 --> 01:40:10.270
REASON I'M GONNA. LAY OFF TODAY

01:40:10.337 --> 01:40:13.407
IS THAT I THINK THAT IT- THE

01:40:13.474 --> 01:40:15.275
BILL AS IT'S CURRENTLY WRITTEN.

01:40:15.342 --> 01:40:17.111
I'M IS GOING TO DRAW MONEY AWAY

01:40:17.177 --> 01:40:18.312
FROM THE LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE

01:40:18.379 --> 01:40:20.948
SECTOR. ALL I KNOW THAT'S NOT

01:40:21.014 --> 01:40:21.682
YOUR INTENTION AT LEAST AS YOU

01:40:21.749 --> 01:40:23.984
KNOW WE'VE TO DISCUSS THE- OTHER

01:40:24.051 --> 01:40:26.120
BILL THAT'S NOT YOUR INTENTION-

01:40:26.186 --> 01:40:28.389
AND I APPRECIATE THAT. YOU'VE

01:40:28.455 --> 01:40:30.023
AGREED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON

01:40:30.090 --> 01:40:33.761
LANGUAGE TO TRY AND- AVOID THAT-

01:40:33.827 --> 01:40:36.330
THAT THAT OUTCOME. BUT I THINK-

01:40:36.397 --> 01:40:40.300
AS- HAS BEEN HURT THIS AFTERNOON

01:40:40.367 --> 01:40:42.069
THAT. WE YOU KNOW I AGREE WITH

01:40:42.136 --> 01:40:43.370
THE SENTIMENT THAT'S BEEN

01:40:43.437 --> 01:40:45.038
EXPRESSED- THAT WE NEED TO BE

01:40:45.105 --> 01:40:47.341
VERY VERY. CONSCIENTIOUS ABOUT-

01:40:47.408 --> 01:40:50.077
NOT HURTING THAT SECTOR OF THE

01:40:50.144 --> 01:40:54.748
HYDROGEN. MARKET THIS IS A-

01:40:54.815 --> 01:40:58.519
COMPLICATED WEB OF FUNDING- IN

01:40:58.585 --> 01:41:00.521
MY VIEW IT'S BEEN UNDERFUNDED

01:41:00.587 --> 01:41:03.023
FOR- FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND

01:41:03.090 --> 01:41:06.460
THAT IS LEADING TO- OF THIS

01:41:06.527 --> 01:41:07.928
CONFLICT OVER WHO'S GONNA GET

01:41:07.995 --> 01:41:09.863
THE FEW DOLLARS. THAT OF THAT

01:41:09.930 --> 01:41:12.466
THAT THAT ARE AVAILABLE- I WISH

01:41:12.533 --> 01:41:14.601
THAT WEREN'T THE CASE BUT- YOU

01:41:14.668 --> 01:41:16.603
KNOW SOME OF THIS IS THAT- A

01:41:16.670 --> 01:41:19.006
COMPETITION OVER. SCARCE DOLLARS

01:41:19.072 --> 01:41:22.075
AND- I THINK IT'S VERY VERY

01:41:22.142 --> 01:41:23.544
IMPORTANT FOR US TO CONTINUE. TO

01:41:23.610 --> 01:41:26.847
PRIORITIZE THE UC LAKE VEHICLE

01:41:26.914 --> 01:41:30.083
MARKET IT- AS HAS BEEN SAID

01:41:30.150 --> 01:41:31.952
THERE'S BEEN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT

01:41:32.019 --> 01:41:33.754
OF IN. VESTMENT IN THAT SECTOR

01:41:33.821 --> 01:41:37.124
AND- WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO MAKE

01:41:37.191 --> 01:41:40.561
SURE THAT THE NETWORK IS BUILT

01:41:40.627 --> 01:41:42.062
THAT WILL SERVICE THE VEHICLES.

01:41:42.129 --> 01:41:44.398
THAT MANUFACTURERS ARE WILLING

01:41:44.465 --> 01:41:46.266
TO PRODUCE THAT SAID AGAIN I

01:41:46.333 --> 01:41:48.502
WANNA MAKE SURE IT'S UNDERSTOOD

01:41:48.569 --> 01:41:50.070
THAT I DO SUPPORT EXPANSION OF

01:41:50.137 --> 01:41:52.105
THE MEDIUM. AND HEAVY DUTY

01:41:52.172 --> 01:41:54.074
VEHICLE SECTOR AND SO THERE'S

01:41:54.141 --> 01:41:55.742
LOTS OF WORK TO BE DONE THERE

01:41:55.809 --> 01:41:57.544
TOO THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO

01:41:57.611 --> 01:41:59.179
DO HERE- AND- I APPRECIATE THE

01:41:59.246 --> 01:42:01.849
OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO.

01:42:01.915 --> 01:42:12.192
DISCUSS THIS WITH YOU. OKAY- ANY

01:42:12.259 --> 01:42:15.095
OTHER COMMENTS BEFORE WE LET THE

01:42:15.162 --> 01:42:19.967
AUTHOR CLOSE. OKAY SEE NONE

01:42:20.033 --> 01:42:21.535
MISTER BENNETT WOULD YOU LIKE TO

01:42:21.602 --> 01:42:23.670
CLOSE I WOULD AND IF IT IF IT

01:42:23.737 --> 01:42:25.038
WITH THE CHAIRS INTELLIGENCE- I

01:42:25.105 --> 01:42:27.007
WOULD LIKE TO RESTORE AND I HAD

01:42:27.074 --> 01:42:28.208
PLEASE RESPOND TO SOME OF THESE

01:42:28.275 --> 01:42:29.810
COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE

01:42:29.877 --> 01:42:30.978
JUST BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE VERY

01:42:31.044 --> 01:42:31.945
MANY OPPORTUNITIES WHERE WE CAN

01:42:32.012 --> 01:42:34.114
AS A GROUP TALK ABOUT- IT

01:42:34.181 --> 01:42:35.949
IMPORTANT LEGISLATION LIKE THIS.

01:42:36.016 --> 01:42:37.618
I'LL TRY TO BE BRIEF AND MAKE A

01:42:37.684 --> 01:42:39.186
NUMBER OF POINTS NUMBER ONE AS

01:42:39.253 --> 01:42:40.687
YOU SAID THE WORLD IS AHEAD OF

01:42:40.754 --> 01:42:42.689
US IN TERMS OF HYDROGEN SO I

01:42:42.756 --> 01:42:44.324
AGREE WE'RE NOT MAKING A

01:42:44.391 --> 01:42:45.726
SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH COMMITMENT TO

01:42:45.792 --> 01:42:47.661
HYDROGENSO AS A MISTER

01:42:47.728 --> 01:42:50.163
CUNNINGHAM JUST POINTED OUT- HE

01:42:50.230 --> 01:42:51.965
WANTS AND I THINK VIRTUALLY

01:42:52.032 --> 01:42:53.834
EVERYBODY HERE WANTS MORE

01:42:53.901 --> 01:42:55.969
FUNDING FOR HYDROGEN AS MANY AS

01:42:56.036 --> 01:42:57.771
AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THERE'S AN

01:42:57.838 --> 01:42:59.072
INTERESTING THING FOR SHOULD BE

01:42:59.139 --> 01:43:00.707
AWARE OF IN THE LEGISLATION WAS

01:43:00.774 --> 01:43:02.676
PASSED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THE

01:43:02.743 --> 01:43:03.844
CALL FOR THE HUNDRED HYDROGEN

01:43:03.911 --> 01:43:04.912
FUELING STATIONS THAT THEN

01:43:04.978 --> 01:43:08.482
GOVERNOR BROWN IN TWENTY

01:43:08.549 --> 01:43:09.816
EIGHTEEN TOOK TO TWO HUNDRED. IT

01:43:09.883 --> 01:43:10.951
DOESN'T DEFINE WHAT KIND OF

01:43:11.018 --> 01:43:12.185
HYDROGEN STATION BUILDER JUST

01:43:12.252 --> 01:43:14.621
SAYS PUBLIC. JUST AS PUBLIC

01:43:14.688 --> 01:43:16.557
FUELING STATIONS NOW IF IT'S AS

01:43:16.623 --> 01:43:18.258
JUST PUBLIC FUELING STATIONS AND

01:43:18.325 --> 01:43:20.794
YET THERE HAS BEEN I THINK AT A

01:43:20.861 --> 01:43:23.096
SENSE THAT DOES ALL HAVE TO BE

01:43:23.163 --> 01:43:25.165
LIGHT DUTY AND THAT'S IN FACT

01:43:25.232 --> 01:43:26.733
VIRTUALLY WHAT'S HAPPENED IS

01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:28.769
THEY HAVE BECOME LIGHT DUTY EVEN

01:43:28.835 --> 01:43:31.138
THOUGH THERE'S NO- THERE'S NO

01:43:31.204 --> 01:43:32.639
REQUIREMENT THAT THEY BE LIGHT

01:43:32.706 --> 01:43:33.740
DUTY AND IT'S JUST SIMPLY THE

01:43:33.807 --> 01:43:35.576
INTERPRETATION. OF THE ENERGY

01:43:35.642 --> 01:43:37.210
COMMISSION TO OF SAID HEY PUBLIC

01:43:37.277 --> 01:43:39.346
PROBABLY MEANS LIGHT DUTY AND

01:43:39.413 --> 01:43:40.347
HEAVY THEY THEY HAVE MOVED THAT

01:43:40.414 --> 01:43:43.417
DIRECTION I WITH THAT SO THE

01:43:43.483 --> 01:43:44.818
MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT I'VE

01:43:44.885 --> 01:43:46.587
HEARD HERE THAT I THINK IS A

01:43:46.653 --> 01:43:47.821
MISSTATEMENT IN TERMS OF WHERE

01:43:47.888 --> 01:43:50.958
WE ARE IS. THIS TAKES MONEY AWAY

01:43:51.024 --> 01:43:53.060
FROM LIGHT DUTY. IF THIS

01:43:53.126 --> 01:43:54.661
PROPOSAL ROLLS OUT THE WAY I

01:43:54.728 --> 01:43:56.597
THINK IT SHOULD. THERE SHOULD BE

01:43:56.663 --> 01:43:59.466
THE SAME NUMBER OF LIGHT DUTY

01:43:59.533 --> 01:44:01.501
STATIONS. WITH THIS OR WITHOUT

01:44:01.568 --> 01:44:03.704
THIS THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS.

01:44:03.770 --> 01:44:05.939
PERHAPS TWENTY OF THEM WILL BE

01:44:06.006 --> 01:44:07.174
LIGHT DUTY STATIONS IN

01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:09.409
CONJUNCTION WITH HEAVY AND

01:44:09.476 --> 01:44:11.378
MEDIUM DUTY STATIONS. THAT DOES

01:44:11.445 --> 01:44:13.580
NOT SEEM LIKE THE DEATH KNELL

01:44:13.647 --> 01:44:16.283
FOR. LIGHT DUTY STATIONS IF THEY

01:44:16.350 --> 01:44:18.852
HAVE A STENCH OF BILLY A HUNDRED

01:44:18.919 --> 01:44:19.786
AND EIGHTY THAT HAVE BEEN

01:44:19.853 --> 01:44:20.887
APPROVED IT'S JUST A SMALL

01:44:20.954 --> 01:44:22.656
NUMBER THAT WOULD THEN. HAVE

01:44:22.723 --> 01:44:24.825
BOTH BUT IT WOULD SEND A MESSAGE

01:44:24.891 --> 01:44:27.694
THAT WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT MAKING

01:44:27.761 --> 01:44:29.262
THE MINIMUM INVESTMENT IN

01:44:29.329 --> 01:44:31.365
HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE. SO THAT

01:44:31.431 --> 01:44:33.834
WE CAN ALSO LAUNCH IN THAT

01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:36.303
SECTOR AS WELL AS LAUNCHING

01:44:36.370 --> 01:44:37.938
LIGHT DUTY WE HAVE AT LEAST MADE

01:44:38.005 --> 01:44:40.040
SOME MINIMUM INVESTMENT.

01:44:40.107 --> 01:44:41.375
EVERYBODY HERE ARE MANY PEOPLE

01:44:41.441 --> 01:44:43.343
HERE INCLUDING MYSELF WOULD LIKE

01:44:43.410 --> 01:44:45.345
IT TO BE LARGER. THANK THAT THE

01:44:45.412 --> 01:44:48.415
LIGHT DUTY- MARKET IS GOING TO

01:44:48.482 --> 01:44:50.317
GO FASTER THAN WHAT A. R. B. AS

01:44:50.384 --> 01:44:53.220
IS- SUGGESTING WHAT CC IS MAKING

01:44:53.286 --> 01:44:54.821
THEIR DECISIONS ON. BUT THE

01:44:54.888 --> 01:44:56.757
IMPORTANT THING FOR US TO

01:44:56.823 --> 01:45:00.127
REMEMBER IS THAT C. ECT ENERGY

01:45:00.193 --> 01:45:01.128
COMMISSION IS THE DECISION

01:45:01.194 --> 01:45:03.430
MAKER. ON HOW MANY LIGHT DUTY

01:45:03.497 --> 01:45:05.432
STATIONS ARE GONNA BE OUT THERE.

01:45:05.499 --> 01:45:07.701
AND THEY HAVE STATED OVER AND

01:45:07.768 --> 01:45:09.836
OVER TWO HUNDRED IS MORE THAN

01:45:09.903 --> 01:45:11.972
ENOUGH. FOR THE NEXT NUMBER OF

01:45:12.039 --> 01:45:14.875
YEARS. AND EVERY EFFORT TO TRY

01:45:14.941 --> 01:45:17.778
TO GO BEYOND THAT HAS FAILED. SO

01:45:17.844 --> 01:45:20.047
AS A NUMBER OF YOU HAVE SAID WE

01:45:20.113 --> 01:45:21.515
HAVE A LIMITED RESOURCE THE ONLY

01:45:21.581 --> 01:45:23.917
THING WE'RE SURE OF IS THERE'S

01:45:23.984 --> 01:45:25.919
GOING TO BE TWO HUNDRED. THIS

01:45:25.986 --> 01:45:27.387
BILL SIMPLY SAYS IF THERE'S ONLY

01:45:27.454 --> 01:45:28.855
GONNA BE TWO HUNDRED AND WE'VE

01:45:28.922 --> 01:45:30.457
ALREADY BUILT A LOT OF LIGHT

01:45:30.524 --> 01:45:31.858
DUTY SHOULD WE HAVE SOME OF

01:45:31.925 --> 01:45:33.627
THEM. BE BOTH LIGHT DUTY AND

01:45:33.694 --> 01:45:35.395
HEAVY DUTY AT THE SAME TIME.

01:45:35.462 --> 01:45:36.763
SHOULDN'T THEY BE LOOK AT JUST I

01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:39.166
THINK IT'S THE BEST INVESTMENT

01:45:39.232 --> 01:45:40.400
WITH THE REMAINING AMOUNT OF

01:45:40.467 --> 01:45:42.302
MONEY NOW THEN WE CAN ALL GO

01:45:42.369 --> 01:45:44.538
OUT. AND AS I'VE EVER HAD SAID

01:45:44.604 --> 01:45:46.640
TO SOME OF YOU WE CAN ALL GO OUT

01:45:46.707 --> 01:45:50.143
AND WHEN YOU HAVE. A HEAVY DUTY.

01:45:50.210 --> 01:45:51.445
INFRASTRUCTURE MOVING FORWARD

01:45:51.511 --> 01:45:53.647
AND HEAVY DUTY INDUSTRY INVOLVED

01:45:53.714 --> 01:45:56.116
THEY WILL BE PARTNERS. IN

01:45:56.183 --> 01:45:59.019
PUSHING FOR GREEN. HYDROGEN TO

01:45:59.086 --> 01:46:01.121
MOVE FORWARD I REALLY WELCOME

01:46:01.188 --> 01:46:03.056
THE FACT IT IS VERY RARE BUT YOU

01:46:03.123 --> 01:46:04.891
HEARD THE PORT OF HUENEME ME

01:46:04.958 --> 01:46:06.927
TESTIFIED TODAY. THAT THEY ARE

01:46:06.993 --> 01:46:09.362
COMMITTED TO GOING A 100% GREEN

01:46:09.429 --> 01:46:10.864
HYDROGEN YOU DON'T HAVE INDUSTRY

01:46:10.931 --> 01:46:12.866
SAYING THAT TO US VERY OFTEN.

01:46:12.933 --> 01:46:14.134
THAT'S THE PARTNERSHIP THAT

01:46:14.201 --> 01:46:17.471
LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES NEED TO MOVE

01:46:17.537 --> 01:46:19.873
FORWARD. SO FINALLY I WOULD JUST

01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:23.176
SAY THAT- I HOPE YOU'LL CONSIDER

01:46:23.243 --> 01:46:25.779
THE FACT THAT- STATEMENTS LIKE

01:46:25.846 --> 01:46:28.415
OBLITERATE THE LIGHT DUTY.

01:46:28.482 --> 01:46:31.952
VEHICLE MARKET. IS VERY HE HAS

01:46:32.018 --> 01:46:33.687
IS THAT OVER STATEMENT RELATIVE

01:46:33.754 --> 01:46:35.655
TO WHERE WE ARE. NO ONE'S GOING

01:46:35.722 --> 01:46:37.791
TO GO TO THE PORCH TO FUEL UP AS

01:46:37.858 --> 01:46:39.860
IF THE ONLY PLACE YOU CAN FUEL

01:46:39.926 --> 01:46:42.395
UP HERE BY GOING TO A PART. OF

01:46:42.462 --> 01:46:46.066
IT AND- SO. I JUST WANT TO

01:46:46.133 --> 01:46:46.867
EMPHASIZE YOU HAVE THE

01:46:46.933 --> 01:46:48.235
ADMINISTRATION OF SUBSTANTIALLY

01:46:48.301 --> 01:46:50.070
HAS LOCKED US AT THE TWO HUNDRED

01:46:50.137 --> 01:46:52.005
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WITH THOSE

01:46:52.072 --> 01:46:52.906
TWO HUNDRED. I THINK COMMON

01:46:52.973 --> 01:46:54.808
SENSE SAYS AT LEAST SOME OF THEM

01:46:54.875 --> 01:46:56.409
SHOULD BE. HEAVY DUTY MEDIUM

01:46:56.476 --> 01:46:57.744

RELIEF THE CALIFORNIANS IS BEING

02:07:39.685 --> 02:07:43.455
AND IS BEING SHOCKINGLY. TO

02:07:43.522 --> 02:07:46.658
RAISE TAXES EVEN MORE IN

02:07:46.725 --> 02:07:49.561
CALIFORNIA AND ON ENERGY OF ALL

02:07:49.628 --> 02:07:52.631
THINGS. THERE IS NO DISPUTE THAT

02:07:52.698 --> 02:07:54.833
CALIFORNIANS ARE PAYING

02:07:54.900 --> 02:07:57.436
SUBSTANTIALLY MORE FOR GASOLINE

02:07:57.503 --> 02:07:59.671
AND OTHER STATES AND THERE IS NO

02:07:59.738 --> 02:08:02.975
DISPUTE THAT THE DIFFERENCE. IS

02:08:03.042 --> 02:08:06.745
BECAUSE OF POLICY CHOICES

02:08:06.812 --> 02:08:09.314
INCLUDING TAXES AND STATE

02:08:09.381 --> 02:08:10.849
MANDATES THAT IS BEING IMPOSED

02:08:10.916 --> 02:08:12.518
IN CALIFORNIA AND NOT ANYWHERE

02:08:12.584 --> 02:08:17.122
ELSE. IF WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT

02:08:17.189 --> 02:08:20.759
THE ENERGY MARKET AND WHY PRICES

02:08:20.826 --> 02:08:22.895
ARE GOING UP RIGHT NOW WITH THE

02:08:22.961 --> 02:08:25.030
UKRAINE. THE PROBLEM THAT WE'VE

02:08:25.097 --> 02:08:28.133
GOT INTO EXISTED BEFORE THE

02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:31.370
UKRAINIAN CONFLICT. IF YOUWANT

02:08:31.437 --> 02:08:33.472
TO LOOK AT THE ISSUE OF FOREIGN

02:08:33.539 --> 02:08:36.608
DEPENDENCE. OF OIL COMING INTO

02:08:36.675 --> 02:08:39.645
CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE TO LOOK

02:08:39.711 --> 02:08:41.880
OURSELVES IN THE MIRROR. WE ARE

02:08:41.947 --> 02:08:43.982
GROWING IN OUR DEPENDENCE ON

02:08:44.049 --> 02:08:45.851
FOREIGN OIL IN CALIFORNIA

02:08:45.918 --> 02:08:48.420
BECAUSE OF THE POLICIES COMING

02:08:48.487 --> 02:08:49.221
FROM THIS ADMINISTRATION AND

02:08:49.288 --> 02:08:52.758
THIS BUILDING THIS LEGISLATURE.

02:08:52.825 --> 02:08:54.159
IT'S BECAUSE OF THE POLICIES

02:08:54.226 --> 02:08:55.794
HAVE BEEN IMPOSED ON CALIFORNIA

02:08:55.861 --> 02:08:56.962
ENERGY PRODUCTION THAT IS

02:08:57.029 --> 02:08:59.465
INCREASED OUR ENERGY FROM

02:08:59.531 --> 02:09:03.335
FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 75% OF THE

02:09:03.402 --> 02:09:06.538
OIL THAT COMES INTO CALIFORNIA

02:09:06.605 --> 02:09:08.440
IS IMPORTED FROM FOREIGN

02:09:08.507 --> 02:09:10.742
COUNTRIES ECUADOR SAUDI ARABIA

02:09:10.809 --> 02:09:15.180
IRAQ 6% OF THAT 75% SINCE LAST

02:09:15.247 --> 02:09:18.016
YEAR CAME FROM RUSSIA. EIGHTEEN

02:09:18.083 --> 02:09:19.751
MILLION BARRELS OF OIL CAME FROM

02:09:19.818 --> 02:09:21.954
RUSSIA THOUSANDS OF PERMITS. ARE

02:09:22.020 --> 02:09:22.988
SITTING BEFORE THE GOVERNOR'S

02:09:23.055 --> 02:09:25.023
DESK THAT WOULD ALLOW AN

02:09:25.090 --> 02:09:26.758
INCREASE IN OIL PRODUCTION IN

02:09:26.825 --> 02:09:29.761
CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA ENERGY

02:09:29.828 --> 02:09:31.864
FOR CALIFORNIANS BY CALIFORNIANS

02:09:31.930 --> 02:09:34.766
BUT WHAT IS BEING DONE NOTHING.

02:09:34.833 --> 02:09:36.602
THE GOVERNOR IS DOING NOTHING

02:09:36.668 --> 02:09:37.836
AND SO OUR FOREIGN OIL

02:09:37.903 --> 02:09:40.372
DEPENDENCE IS GOING UP BECAUSE

02:09:40.439 --> 02:09:42.541
OF THAT. AND BECAUSE OF THAT

02:09:42.608 --> 02:09:44.476
FORMAL DEPENDENCE CALIFORNIA IS

02:09:44.543 --> 02:09:46.345
MORE VULNERABLE IT IS MORE

02:09:46.411 --> 02:09:50.349
AFFORDABLE. BECAUSE OF THE

02:09:50.415 --> 02:09:52.885
INSTABILITY IN THE ENERGY MARKET

02:09:52.951 --> 02:09:54.987
RIGHT NOW. SO WE WANT TO TALK

02:09:55.053 --> 02:09:57.022
ABOUT ENERGY PRODUCTION I'M

02:09:57.089 --> 02:09:59.525
HAPPY TO HAVE THAT DEBATE. LET'S

02:09:59.591 --> 02:10:01.326
PRODUCE ENERGY IN CALIFORNIA

02:10:01.393 --> 02:10:03.929
IT'S NOT WHETHER CALIFORNIA IS

02:10:03.996 --> 02:10:06.165
GOING TO CONSUME ENERGY AND OIL

02:10:06.231 --> 02:10:08.667
AND IT IN OUR STATE THE QUESTION

02:10:08.734 --> 02:10:10.669
IS WHERE IS IT GONNA COME FROM.

02:10:10.736 --> 02:10:13.305
IS IT A IS IT LIKE IS IT GONNA

02:10:13.372 --> 02:10:14.173
COME FROM CALIFORNIA OR IS IT

02:10:14.239 --> 02:10:16.375
GONNA COME FROM OTHER COUNTRIES.

02:10:16.441 --> 02:10:19.978
IN CALIFORNIA IS A ENERGY ISLAND

02:10:20.045 --> 02:10:21.780
. IN OTHER STATES INCREASED OIL

02:10:21.847 --> 02:10:23.749
PRODUCTION. BECAUSE OF THE LACK

02:10:23.815 --> 02:10:25.951
OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND BECAUSE OF

02:10:26.018 --> 02:10:27.319
TRANSPORTATION COSTS IT DOESN'T

02:10:27.386 --> 02:10:29.488
COME TO CALIFORNIA SO LET'S HAVE

02:10:29.555 --> 02:10:31.423
THE ENERGY DEBATE. BUT RIGHT NOW

02:10:31.490 --> 02:10:34.326
WE ARE DISCUSSING HOW TO PROVIDE

02:10:34.393 --> 02:10:37.930
IMMEDIATE RELIEF TO CALIFORNIANS

02:10:37.996 --> 02:10:40.132
THAT IS A VERY CRUCIAL TIME. AND

02:10:40.199 --> 02:10:43.835
THESE AMENDMENTS. IMPOSE A NEW

02:10:43.902 --> 02:10:45.437
VEHICLE FUEL WINDFALL PROFITS

02:10:45.504 --> 02:10:49.074
TAX AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE END

02:10:49.141 --> 02:10:51.176
OF COURSE THERE'S IS BIG DEBATE

02:10:51.243 --> 02:10:53.645
ON ON WITH HOW THE PRICE OF OIL

02:10:53.712 --> 02:10:56.448
IS AT A PRICE OF GASOLINE IS

02:10:56.515 --> 02:10:58.717
DETERMINED. THE CDC HAS DONE THE

02:10:58.784 --> 02:11:00.886
ANALYSIS. THEY'VE DONE THE

02:11:00.953 --> 02:11:02.287
REPORTS THE GOVERNOR'S ASK FOR

02:11:02.354 --> 02:11:03.889
INVESTIGATION DEPARTMENT JUSTICE

02:11:03.956 --> 02:11:06.558
HAS DONE AN INVESTIGATION. 51%

02:11:06.625 --> 02:11:08.794
OF THE PRICE OF GASOLINE COMES

02:11:08.860 --> 02:11:11.296
FROM THE STATE GAS TAX 80% COMES

02:11:11.363 --> 02:11:13.899
FROM. THE FEDERAL EXCISE TAX

02:11:13.966 --> 02:11:15.934
THEN YOU HAVE CAP AND TRADE THE

02:11:16.001 --> 02:11:17.803
LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD OVER A

02:11:17.869 --> 02:11:19.771
DOLLAR OF THE PRICE OF GASOLINE

02:11:19.838 --> 02:11:22.674
IN CALIFORNIA IS BECAUSE OF

02:11:22.741 --> 02:11:25.077
TAXES AND REGULATIONS. IT IS

02:11:25.143 --> 02:11:26.912
PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT IF YOU

02:11:26.979 --> 02:11:29.314
COMPARE THE PRICE OF GASOLINE IN

02:11:29.381 --> 02:11:31.250
A CALIFORNIA TO OTHER STATES THE

02:11:31.316 --> 02:11:33.685
DIFFERENCE IS THAT. IT'S THE

02:11:33.752 --> 02:11:36.121
CALIFORNIA WAY THAT IS CAUSING

02:11:36.188 --> 02:11:38.790
THE PRICE OF OIL IF THE PRICE OF

02:11:38.857 --> 02:11:41.126
GASOLINE TO GO UP AND THAT THE

02:11:41.193 --> 02:11:41.927
PRICE OF ENERGY PRODUCTION TO GO

02:11:41.994 --> 02:11:44.563
UP AND WHY WE CAN'T PRODUCE. OIL

02:11:44.630 --> 02:11:46.965
DOMESTICALLY. OTHER STATES HAVE

02:11:47.032 --> 02:11:49.368
DONE IT AS THIS AS MR ASSEMBLY

02:11:49.434 --> 02:11:50.769
MEMBER KILEY AS MENTIONED

02:11:50.836 --> 02:11:52.671
GEORGIA HAS SUSPENDED ITS TWENTY

02:11:52.738 --> 02:11:54.773
NINE CENT GAS TAX. CONNECTICUT

02:11:54.840 --> 02:11:56.842
AS PAT AS PASSED IN HAS

02:11:56.908 --> 02:11:58.343
TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED ITS TWENTY

02:11:58.410 --> 02:12:00.912
FIVE CENT GAS TAX MARYLAND HAS

02:12:00.979 --> 02:12:02.648
TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED ITS THREE

02:12:02.714 --> 02:12:04.616
CENT GAS TAX THIS IS NOT A NEW

02:12:04.683 --> 02:12:07.452
IDEA. THIS IS A BIPARTISAN IDEA

02:12:07.519 --> 02:12:10.088
WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT YOU

02:12:10.155 --> 02:12:12.157
NASTY PASSED IN OTHER STATES.

02:12:12.224 --> 02:12:14.760
AND OF COURSE THE REBATE DEBATE

02:12:14.826 --> 02:12:15.994
AND WHAT THE WHAT THE OPPONENTS

02:12:16.061 --> 02:12:17.929
HAVE SAID. THE REAL GIVING

02:12:17.996 --> 02:12:19.798
RELIEF TO CALIFORNIA VOTERS

02:12:19.865 --> 02:12:20.999
RIGHT NOW DRAKE TEMPERATE GAS

02:12:21.066 --> 02:12:23.702
EXPANSION IS NOT MUTUALLY

02:22:07.685 --> 02:22:10.054

YOU ALL ARE SO APPALLED AND

02:22:11.823 --> 02:22:13.958
SHOCKED BY THIS. THIS IS EXACTLY

02:22:14.025 --> 02:22:16.628
OUR PROCESS THAT WE DEBATE A

02:22:16.694 --> 02:22:18.129
PROBLEM AND WHAT THE SOLUTION IS

02:22:18.196 --> 02:22:20.565
GOING TO BE WE DIDN'T INVENT ANY

02:22:20.632 --> 02:22:21.733
OF THIS PROCEDURE THIS IS

02:22:21.799 --> 02:22:24.002
LONGSTANDING PROCEDURE ABOUT

02:22:24.068 --> 02:22:26.437
WHAT WE DO IN COMMITTEE. I DON'T

02:22:26.504 --> 02:22:28.006
PROBLEM IS BEEN IDENTIFIED

02:22:28.072 --> 02:22:29.774
RIGHTLY BY THE AUTHOR WHICH IS

02:22:29.841 --> 02:22:31.676
THAT GAS PRICES ARE HIGH AND

02:22:31.743 --> 02:22:32.810
IT'S HURTING PEOPLE WHO CAN'T

02:22:32.877 --> 02:22:34.846
AFFORD IT. NO ONE HERE DISAGREES

02:22:34.913 --> 02:22:37.048
WITH THAT. THE DIFFERENCES THAT

02:22:37.115 --> 02:22:38.883
WE ARE TRYING TO POINT OUT AND

02:22:38.950 --> 02:22:40.618
RECOGNIZE THAT THE PROBLEM HERE

02:22:40.685 --> 02:22:42.553
IS THAT WHILE THE PRICE OF OIL

02:22:42.620 --> 02:22:44.923
IS CONTINUING TO DROP THE PRICE

02:22:44.989 --> 02:22:46.491
OF CRUDE OIL IS CONTINUING TO

02:22:46.557 --> 02:22:48.326
DROP IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS

02:22:48.393 --> 02:22:49.894
THE COUNTRY. PRICES IN

02:22:49.961 --> 02:22:52.263
CALIFORNIA KEEP GOING UP AND NOT

02:22:52.330 --> 02:22:53.865
BECAUSE OF THE SMALL INCREASE AT

02:22:53.932 --> 02:22:55.700
THE GAS TAX TOOK LAST YEAR WHICH

02:22:55.767 --> 02:22:57.368
WAS JUST A COUPLE OF PENNIES.

02:22:57.435 --> 02:22:58.836
BUT BECAUSE THE OIL INDUSTRY IS

02:22:58.903 --> 02:23:01.139
ADDING GIANT SURCHARGES WHICH

02:23:01.205 --> 02:23:03.675
THEY HAVE NOT EXPLAINED TO THE

02:23:03.741 --> 02:23:05.810
PUBLIC. IN ANY DEPTH EVEN THOUGH

02:23:05.877 --> 02:23:07.345
THEY'VE BEEN REPEATEDLY ASKED

02:23:07.412 --> 02:23:09.447
WHAT THOSE SURCHARGES ARE FOR.

02:23:09.514 --> 02:23:11.349
THEIR CHARGED IN CALIFORNIA AND

02:23:11.416 --> 02:23:14.252
NOT IN OTHER STATES. I KNOW THAT

02:23:14.319 --> 02:23:15.987
THE SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE

02:23:16.054 --> 02:23:17.588
WHO SUPPORT THE ORIGINAL BILL

02:23:17.655 --> 02:23:19.624
WOULD LIKE US TO ENGAGE IN THE

02:23:19.691 --> 02:23:21.526
SAME KIND OF TRICKLE DOWN.

02:23:21.592 --> 02:23:24.262
POLITICS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE

02:23:24.329 --> 02:23:25.229
PAST YOUR BRAKES TO THE

02:23:25.296 --> 02:23:27.231
CORPORATIONS LET THAN LARGE

02:23:27.298 --> 02:23:27.799
CORPORATIONS CHARGE WHATEVER

02:23:27.865 --> 02:23:30.768
THEY WANT. DON'T TAX THEM EVEN

02:23:30.835 --> 02:23:32.937
THOUGH THEY HAVE MADE WINDFALL

02:23:33.004 --> 02:23:35.673
PROFITS THIS YEAR AND LAST YEAR

02:23:35.740 --> 02:23:37.175
. COMPLETELY UNPRECEDENTED

02:23:37.241 --> 02:23:38.943
PROFITS IN THE OIL INDUSTRY

02:23:39.010 --> 02:23:42.480
DON'T TAXES THAT INSTEAD OUT DO

02:23:42.547 --> 02:23:43.481
ALLOW THEM TO CHARGE WHATEVER

02:23:43.548 --> 02:23:46.184
THEY WANT AND HOPE IT TRICKLES

02:23:46.250 --> 02:23:48.820
DOWN TO THE COMMON PEOPLE YES

02:23:48.886 --> 02:23:50.388
THERE'S BEEN A PROBLEM

02:23:50.455 --> 02:23:51.222
IDENTIFIED IN THIS BILL BUT

02:23:51.289 --> 02:23:53.691
NOTHING IN THE ORIGINAL BILL AS

02:23:53.758 --> 02:23:56.561
PROPOSED SAYS THAT EVEN A PENNY.

02:23:56.627 --> 02:23:59.063
OF THAT TAX RELIEF GETS PASSED

02:23:59.130 --> 02:24:00.732
THROUGH THE PUMP TO INDIVIDUALS

02:24:00.798 --> 02:24:02.667
WE LEAVE IT UP TO THOSE BIG

02:24:02.734 --> 02:24:03.968
CORPORATION TO THE SIDE BUT NOW

02:24:04.035 --> 02:24:05.770
THAT THEY KNOW THAT PEOPLE WILL

02:24:05.837 --> 02:24:07.939
PAY SIX DOLLARS A GALLON OR FIVE

02:24:08.006 --> 02:24:08.773
FIFTY A GALLON THERE'S

02:24:08.840 --> 02:24:10.641
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THAT SAYS BUT

02:24:10.708 --> 02:24:12.543
THEY DON'T JUST POCKET. THAT

02:24:12.610 --> 02:24:15.079
EXTRA MONEY NOTHING SO BECAUSE

02:24:15.146 --> 02:24:16.781
THIS PROBLEM IS SO GRAVE ONE OF

02:24:16.848 --> 02:24:18.082
OUR MEMBERS HAS PROPOSED AN

02:24:18.149 --> 02:24:20.084
ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION GO TO THE

02:24:20.151 --> 02:24:21.719
HEART OF THE PROBLEM THOSE

02:24:21.786 --> 02:24:23.187
WINDFALL PROFITS AND AT LEAST

02:24:23.254 --> 02:24:25.023

02:24:27.492 --> 02:24:29.494
PIECE OF THAT AND GIVE IT RIGHT

02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:30.661

02:24:30.728 --> 02:24:32.196
GENERAL FUND BACK FILLING. OF

02:24:32.263 --> 02:24:33.765
THESE TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS

02:24:33.831 --> 02:24:34.699
THAT THOUGHT THAT SOMETHING THAT

02:24:34.766 --> 02:24:37.402
MR KILEY HAS NOT TOLD THE PUBLIC

02:24:37.468 --> 02:24:38.102
HERE IS THAT BECAUSE OF

02:24:38.169 --> 02:24:39.737
SOMETHING CALLED BEGAN LIMIT IF

02:24:39.804 --> 02:24:40.938
THAT MONEY GOES INTO THESE

02:24:41.005 --> 02:24:42.507
TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS AND IS

02:24:42.573 --> 02:24:44.375
TAKEN OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND

02:24:44.442 --> 02:24:45.476
MONEY THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE

02:24:45.543 --> 02:24:49.013
TO BE GIVEN BACK TO THE PUBLIC.

02:24:49.080 --> 02:24:50.648
WON'T GO BACK TO THEM. SO ONCE

02:24:50.715 --> 02:24:52.650

02:24:52.717 --> 02:24:53.384
THE POCKETS. OF INDIVIDUAL

THE WINDFALL PROFITS OF THE OIL

02:24:58.556 --> 02:25:00.491
INDUSTRY SO IT'S PROPER THAT

02:25:00.558 --> 02:25:02.627
WHEN A PROBLEM IS IDENTIFIED.

02:25:02.693 --> 02:25:04.862
THAT WE DON'T THINK. A SOLUTIONS

BEING OFFERED TO THAT SOMEBODY

02:25:06.330 --> 02:25:07.632
WANTS TO MAKE A SUBSTITUTE

02:25:07.698 --> 02:25:09.500
MOTION THAT ACTUALLY MIGHT HAVE

02:25:09.567 --> 02:25:11.469
A CHANCE OF SOLVING THIS PROBLEM

02:25:11.536 --> 02:25:12.403
AND THAT'S WHAT'S BEING DONE

02:25:12.470 --> 02:25:14.472
HERE TODAY. BUT TO PRETEND THAT

02:25:14.539 --> 02:25:16.941
THERE'S THAT WE'VE ANYTHING WE

02:25:17.008 --> 02:25:18.943
OFTEN IN COMMITTEE SUGGEST OTHER

02:25:19.010 --> 02:25:21.345
SOLUTIONS OF COURSE WE COULD

02:25:21.412 --> 02:25:22.580
JUST VOTE THIS DOWN. WE KNOW WE

02:25:22.647 --> 02:25:24.082

TRY TO GIVE PEOPLE RELIEF AT THE

02:25:28.286 --> 02:25:29.387
PUMP BECAUSE WE DO THINK THAT

02:25:29.454 --> 02:25:32.356
IT'S IMPORTANT. SO I DO THINK

02:25:32.423 --> 02:25:36.661
THAT. UGH UGH I THINK THAT THERE

02:25:36.727 --> 02:25:38.629
IS SOME ISSUES HERE BUT I THINK

02:25:38.696 --> 02:25:39.864
THAT THIS BILL CAUSES EXTRA

02:25:39.931 --> 02:25:41.532
PROBLEMS WHICH IS TAKING AWAY

02:25:41.599 --> 02:25:43.901
MONEY THAT RIGHT NOW IS GOING TO

02:25:43.968 --> 02:25:46.704
TAXPAYERS SUPPORTED. WE KNOW

02:25:46.771 --> 02:25:49.407
THAT THIS THIS GAS TAX WAS JUST

02:25:49.474 --> 02:25:51.008
VALIDATED AGAIN BY THE PUBLIC

02:25:51.075 --> 02:25:53.311
TWO YEARS AGO. AT THESE PROJECTS

02:25:53.377 --> 02:25:55.113
THAT ARE IMPORTANT. TO KEEP

02:25:55.179 --> 02:25:56.848
ROADS SAFE TO KEEP BRIDGES FROM

02:25:56.914 --> 02:25:58.883
COLLAPSING TO INVEST IN

02:25:58.950 --> 02:26:00.351
INFRASTRUCTURE WITH THE PEOPLE

02:26:00.418 --> 02:26:02.320
OF CALIFORNIA SAID THAT THEY

02:26:02.386 --> 02:26:04.589
WANT. BUT THAT MONEY WILL BE

02:26:04.655 --> 02:26:06.591
PULLED OUT FROM UNDER THEM. AND

02:26:06.657 --> 02:26:08.726
SO THE OTHER PROBLEMS THAT COULD

02:26:08.793 --> 02:26:10.728
BE CREATED BY THIS. SO I CAN I

02:26:10.795 --> 02:26:12.130

HIGHEST POVERTY RATE OF ANY

02:28:12.183 --> 02:28:13.551
STATE IN THE COUNTRY. YOU WONDER

02:28:13.618 --> 02:28:15.219
WHY. WE'VE NOW REACHED A

02:28:15.286 --> 02:28:17.054
BREAKING POINT WHERE FOR THE

02:28:17.121 --> 02:28:18.556
FIRST TIME IN OUR ONE HUNDRED

02:28:18.623 --> 02:28:20.625
FIFTY YEAR HISTORY. ARE LEAVING

02:28:20.691 --> 02:28:22.793
THE STATE THAT ARE COMING HERE.

02:28:22.860 --> 02:28:23.828
EVER WONDER WHY THE VAST

02:28:23.894 --> 02:28:26.397
MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS SAY THE

02:28:26.464 --> 02:28:27.832
KIDS GROWING UP IN OUR STATE

02:28:27.898 --> 02:28:29.600
TODAY WILL BE WORSE OFF THAN

02:28:29.667 --> 02:28:30.801
THEIR PARENTS THINK ABOUT THAT.

02:28:30.868 --> 02:28:32.470
THAT IS THE VERY DEFINITION OF

02:28:32.536 --> 02:28:34.005
THE AMERICAN DREAM AND OUR

02:28:34.071 --> 02:28:35.840
PEOPLE THINK THAT IT'S DEBT.

02:28:35.906 --> 02:28:37.141
THIS USED TO BE THE STATE WHERE

02:28:37.208 --> 02:28:38.843
ANYONE COULD GET AHEAD IT'S NOW

02:28:38.909 --> 02:28:40.611
THE STATE THAT SO MANY CAN'T

02:28:40.678 --> 02:28:42.446
WAIT TO LEAVE BEHIND. AND THAT

02:28:42.513 --> 02:28:44.582
IS A TRAGEDY. AND THERE IS

02:28:44.649 --> 02:28:46.817
ABSOLUTELY NO DENYING THAT IT IS

02:28:46.884 --> 02:28:48.319
THE RESULT OF GOVERNMENT

02:28:48.386 --> 02:28:50.921
POLICIES. AND THE PROCEEDINGS

02:28:50.988 --> 02:28:53.858
HERE TODAY ARE A PERFECT EXAMPLE

02:28:53.924 --> 02:28:56.827
OF THAT. THE ARGUMENTS RAISED

02:28:56.894 --> 02:28:59.063
AGAINST THIS BILL ARE SELF

02:28:59.130 --> 02:29:02.033
EVIDENTLY BOGUS. IF GAS PRICES

02:29:02.099 --> 02:29:03.934
IN CALIFORNIA ARE ENTIRELY A

02:29:04.001 --> 02:29:05.936
PRODUCT OF INTERNATIONAL EVENTS.

02:29:06.003 --> 02:29:07.471
AND WHY DOES CALIFORNIA HAVE

02:29:07.538 --> 02:29:10.308
MUCH HIGHER GAS PRICES IN ALL

02:29:10.374 --> 02:29:13.210
FORTY NINE OTHER STATES. SEVENTY

02:29:13.277 --> 02:29:14.245
CENTS HIGHER THAN THE NEXT

02:29:14.312 --> 02:29:16.447
CLOSEST STATE. IF SPENDING THE

02:29:16.514 --> 02:29:18.883
GAS TAX IS SOMEHOW. POLITICALLY

02:29:18.949 --> 02:29:20.851
MOTIVATED THEN WHY DID EVERY

02:29:20.918 --> 02:29:22.987
SINGLE REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT

02:29:23.054 --> 02:29:23.954
MEMBER OF THE CONNECTICUT

02:29:24.021 --> 02:29:26.057
LEGISLATURE VOTE TO DO PRECISELY

02:29:26.123 --> 02:29:28.225
THAT. WHY DID THE VERY LIBERAL

02:29:28.292 --> 02:29:29.960
GOVERNOR OF CONNECTICUT NO TO DO

02:29:30.027 --> 02:29:32.296
PRECISELY THAT. WHY DID THE SAN

02:29:32.363 --> 02:29:34.298
DIEGO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS

02:29:34.365 --> 02:29:37.134
UNANIMOUSLY PASSED A RESOLUTION.

02:29:37.201 --> 02:29:38.936
URGING THIS BODY URGING THE

02:29:39.003 --> 02:29:40.738
GOVERNOR TO DO EXACTLY WHAT MY

02:29:40.805 --> 02:29:43.507
ORIGINAL BILL. WOULD DO HERE

02:29:43.574 --> 02:29:47.044
TODAY. IF THIS BENEFITS WOULD

02:29:47.111 --> 02:29:49.046
NOT BE PASSED ON TO CONSUMERS

02:29:49.113 --> 02:29:51.082
THEN WHY DID OUR OWN LEGISLATIVE

02:29:51.148 --> 02:29:53.584
ANALYST THE NONPARTISAN OFFICIAL

02:29:53.651 --> 02:29:54.785
APPOINTED UNANIMOUSLY BY THIS

02:29:54.852 --> 02:29:56.921
BODY WHY DID OUR LEGISLATIVE

02:29:56.987 --> 02:29:58.856
ANALYSTS SAY THAT IT WOULD OR

02:29:58.923 --> 02:30:01.125
WHY HAVE GAS PRICES DECLINED IN

02:30:01.192 --> 02:30:02.626
THE STATES THAT HAVE SUSPENDED

02:30:02.693 --> 02:30:05.863
THEIR GAS TAX FOR WHY IT IS EVEN

02:30:05.930 --> 02:30:07.231
GOVERNOR NEWSOM PROPOSING TO

02:30:07.298 --> 02:30:09.600
HOLD OFF ON ANOTHER THREE CENT

02:30:09.667 --> 02:30:11.135
INCREASE TO THE GAS TAX THIS

02:30:11.202 --> 02:30:12.269
YEAR IS IT BECAUSE GOVERNOR

02:30:12.336 --> 02:30:13.637
NEWSOM WANTS TO GIVE GAS

02:30:13.704 --> 02:30:16.240
COMPANIES OIL COMPANIES. A THREE

02:30:16.307 --> 02:30:18.976
CENT WINDFALL. IF THIS BILL IS

02:30:19.043 --> 02:30:20.411
SOMEHOW GOING TO TAKE FUNDING

02:30:20.478 --> 02:30:23.013
AWAY FROM ROADS THEN WHY DOES

02:30:23.080 --> 02:30:26.016
THE PLAIN TEXT OF THE OF THE OF

02:30:26.083 --> 02:30:28.085
THE BILL SAY THAT IT WILL NOT.

02:30:28.152 --> 02:30:29.820
SO WE HAVE TO PROPOSALS IN FRONT

02:30:29.887 --> 02:30:31.956
OF US. WE HAVE ONE THAT WOULD

02:30:32.022 --> 02:30:34.291
CUT OUR STATE'S GAS TAX WE HAVE

02:30:34.358 --> 02:30:36.894
ANOTHER THAT WOULD RAISE TAXES.

02:30:36.961 --> 02:30:39.597
I PREFER MY VERSION. NOW I AM

02:30:39.663 --> 02:30:43.734
NOT GOING TO CRITICIZE ALEX LEE

02:30:43.801 --> 02:30:45.369
. YOU ALL HAVE HAYES THIS POOR

02:30:45.436 --> 02:30:47.138
GUY SINCE THE MOMENT HE GOT TO

02:30:47.204 --> 02:30:49.039
THE LEGISLATURE AND TODAY IT IS

02:30:49.106 --> 02:30:52.009
A NOTHER EXAMPLE THAT MAKING HIM

02:30:52.076 --> 02:30:52.943
DO THIS MAKING HIM DO YOUR

02:30:53.010 --> 02:30:55.112
BIDDING. WE KNOW THAT YOU KNOW

02:30:55.179 --> 02:30:57.114
HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT BECAUSE

02:30:57.181 --> 02:30:58.949
HE WON'T EVEN PUT HIS NAME ON

02:30:59.016 --> 02:31:01.719
THE BILL I FEEL SORRY FOR HIM WE

02:31:01.786 --> 02:31:02.853
CAN ALL REMEMBER A MEMBER OF

02:31:02.920 --> 02:31:04.388
THIS COMMITTEE. BERATING HIM

02:31:04.455 --> 02:31:06.323
FROM THE DIESS. SHORTLY AFTER HE

02:31:06.390 --> 02:31:08.859
ARRIVED IN THE LEGISLATURE. AND

02:31:08.926 --> 02:31:10.928
SO THIS SPEAKS TO MORE THAN AN

02:31:10.995 --> 02:31:13.063
ISSUE. OF DEMOCRAT VERSUS

02:31:13.130 --> 02:31:17.067
REPUBLICAN. REPORTER I REALIZE

02:31:17.134 --> 02:31:18.536
THAT THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL

02:31:18.602 --> 02:31:19.737
WANT TO TURN EVERYTHING INTO A

02:31:19.804 --> 02:31:21.205
CAMPAIGN COMMERCIAL FIRST

02:31:21.272 --> 02:31:22.139
USUALLY FAIL CONGRESSIONAL

02:31:22.206 --> 02:31:24.208
CAMPAIGN BUT- ASKING TO STICK TO

02:31:24.275 --> 02:31:25.643
THE MERITS OF THE CONVERSATION

02:31:25.709 --> 02:31:27.011
IN THE MERITS OF THE BILL AND

02:31:27.077 --> 02:31:29.046
NOT GET SIDETRACKED BY

02:31:29.113 --> 02:31:31.615
UNNECESSARY PERSONAL ATTACKS ON

02:31:31.682 --> 02:31:32.850
MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. THANK

MISTER KILEY CAN YOU. STOP WITH

02:31:37.154 --> 02:31:39.156
THE PERSONAL COMMENTS AND TRY TO

02:31:39.223 --> 02:31:41.792
STICK TO THE MERITS OF YOUR OF

02:31:41.859 --> 02:31:43.894
THIS BILL ENDING A PERSONAL COME

02:31:43.961 --> 02:31:45.896
. I'M TALKING ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT

02:31:45.963 --> 02:31:47.798
HAS JUST TRANSPIRED. IN FRONT OF

02:31:47.865 --> 02:31:49.733
THIS COMMITTEE. I MISTER KILEY

02:31:49.800 --> 02:31:50.801
YOU'VE EXCEEDED THE NORMAL

02:31:50.868 --> 02:31:52.570
AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WE GET

02:31:52.636 --> 02:31:53.938
PEOPLE TO CLOSE SO IF YOU CAN

02:31:54.004 --> 02:31:56.006
TRY TO. CLARA AND THANK YOU. IF

02:31:56.073 --> 02:31:58.075
IT IS YOUR BASIC DECENCY. AND

02:31:58.142 --> 02:31:59.877
YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WE CAN

02:31:59.944 --> 02:32:01.679
HAVE OUR DIFFERENCES WE CAN HAVE

02:32:01.745 --> 02:32:03.514
OUR DIFFERENCES OF POLICY. BUT

02:32:03.581 --> 02:32:04.882
WHAT HAPPENED WITH THIS BILL I

02:32:04.949 --> 02:32:07.485
MEAN. IT WAS SITTING ON THE DESK

02:32:07.551 --> 02:32:08.886
GATHERING DUST FOR OVER TWO

02:32:08.953 --> 02:32:10.654
MONTHS I INTRODUCED IT. ON

02:32:10.721 --> 02:32:12.890
JANUARY TWELFTH THAT'S THE

02:32:12.957 --> 02:32:14.892
REASON WE TRY TO BRING IT TO THE

02:32:14.959 --> 02:32:15.960
FLOOR FOR A VOTE. BECAUSE WE

02:32:16.026 --> 02:32:17.695
WERE GIVEN HERE. SO THEN AFTER

02:32:17.761 --> 02:32:19.930
WE DO THAT YOU FINALLY DECIDE TO

02:32:19.997 --> 02:32:21.098
GIVE IT A HEARING AND OF COURSE

02:32:21.165 --> 02:32:22.766
I KNEW YOU'RE GONNA DO THIS.

02:32:22.833 --> 02:32:23.767
YOU'RE NOT PARTICULARLY CLEVER

02:32:23.834 --> 02:32:24.902
ABOUT IT. I YOU BROUGHT THE

02:32:24.969 --> 02:32:26.637
PARLIAMENTARIAN WITH YOU BY THE

02:32:26.704 --> 02:32:29.006
WAY IS A IS A WONDERFUL PERSON

02:32:29.073 --> 02:32:31.542
AND DOES HER JOB. VERY WELL. I'M

02:32:31.609 --> 02:32:33.744
AND SO I KNEW WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

02:32:33.811 --> 02:32:36.113
I EVEN TRIED TO TALK TO THE

02:32:36.180 --> 02:32:37.314
CHAIRMAN FOR HIM TO SEE IF SHE

02:32:37.381 --> 02:32:38.749
WOULD. SAY SOMETHING ABOUT IT

02:32:38.816 --> 02:32:40.484
BUT NOW. I THERE WAS NO

02:32:40.551 --> 02:32:42.253
DISCUSSION OF THAT SO I THINK

02:32:42.319 --> 02:32:47.391
THAT. THE ISSUE HERE IS REALLY

02:32:47.458 --> 02:32:49.527
ONE OF BASIC DECENCY AND THE

02:32:49.593 --> 02:32:52.396
ISSUE A POLICY PERSPECTIVE IS

02:32:52.463 --> 02:32:53.631
ONE THAT I WOULD HOPE WOULD JUST

02:32:53.697 --> 02:32:55.966
BE KIND OF A SLAM DUNK LIKE

02:32:56.033 --> 02:32:57.535
PEOPLE ARE REALLY IN PAIN.

02:32:57.601 --> 02:32:59.737
PEOPLE NEED RELIEF IT'S HURTING

02:32:59.803 --> 02:33:01.305
THE POOREST CALIFORNIANS THE

02:33:01.372 --> 02:33:02.873
MOST I'VE TRIED TO PROVIDE A

02:33:02.940 --> 02:33:05.509
FORM OF RELIEF THAT WILL BE

02:33:05.576 --> 02:33:07.244
IMMEDIATE. IT WILL BE EFFECTIVE

02:33:07.311 --> 02:33:09.213
IT'LL HELP OUT A LOT OF PEOPLE I

02:33:09.280 --> 02:33:10.247
THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THAT

02:33:10.314 --> 02:33:13.183
IS BEING. USED AS A VEHICLE TO

02:33:13.250 --> 02:33:14.652
JUST BUY POLITICAL GAMES BUT I

YOU ABOUT THIS BEFORE TODAY- I

02:44:28.491 --> 02:44:29.993
WAS HOPE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'D

02:44:30.060 --> 02:44:32.062
BE WILLING TO ENTERTAIN THE IDEA

02:44:32.128 --> 02:44:34.130
OF AT LEAST MAKING IT BASED ON

02:44:34.197 --> 02:44:36.066
JURISDICTIONS BECAUSE- NOT ALL

02:44:36.132 --> 02:44:38.735
COUNTIES ARE THE SAME NOT ALL.

02:44:38.802 --> 02:44:39.736
JEWISH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE

02:44:39.803 --> 02:44:41.671
THE SAME. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS

02:44:41.738 --> 02:44:43.506
WOULD WORK NECESSARILY WELL. IN

02:44:43.573 --> 02:44:45.609
LOS ANGELES. AND I APPRECIATE

02:44:45.675 --> 02:44:47.277
THE FOLKS THAT ARE CALLING IN.

02:44:47.344 --> 02:44:49.713
AS WELL FROM LA BUT THE REALITY

02:44:49.779 --> 02:44:52.215
IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF BLIND

02:44:52.282 --> 02:44:53.450
INTERSECTIONS. I DON'T KNOW IF

02:44:53.516 --> 02:44:54.651
SOMETHING LIKE THIS WOULD WORK

02:44:54.718 --> 02:44:56.786
WELL IN A PLACE IN A DENSE AT

02:44:56.853 --> 02:44:59.589
PLACE LIKE LOS ANGELES. UP BUT I

02:44:59.656 --> 02:45:03.159
KNOW THAT IN. SPACE WISE 90% OF

02:45:03.226 --> 02:45:04.861
THE REST OF THE STATE IT'LL WORK

02:45:04.928 --> 02:45:06.930
JUST FINE. I AND I UNDERSTAND

02:45:06.997 --> 02:45:09.332
THAT BUT MAYBE WE CAN. TAILOR IT

02:45:09.399 --> 02:45:10.867
SO THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CAN

02:45:10.934 --> 02:45:12.802
PARTICIPATE IN THIS SAID THAT

02:45:12.869 --> 02:45:14.070
THOSE THAT DON'T FEEL IT'S

02:45:14.137 --> 02:45:17.007

02:45:23.413 --> 02:45:26.349
MISTER- MISTER O'DONNELL. I

02:45:26.416 --> 02:45:29.719
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR NOT. I

02:45:29.786 --> 02:45:30.887
WISH I COULD SUPPORT THIS TODAY

02:45:30.954 --> 02:45:33.156
BUT I'M JUST NOT THERE THIS IS A

02:45:33.223 --> 02:45:35.458
PARENT AND A TEACHER BROWN KIDS

02:45:35.525 --> 02:45:37.961
A LOT AND I THINK WHEN SOMETHING

02:45:38.028 --> 02:45:41.131
IS CONFUSING AT LEAST TO AN

02:45:41.197 --> 02:45:42.432
UNSAFE SITUATION HAS BEEN HAS

02:45:42.499 --> 02:45:45.235
BEEN HAS BEEN ALLUDED TO BY ONE

02:45:45.302 --> 02:45:47.537
OF THE- SPEAKERS EARLIER.

02:45:47.604 --> 02:45:48.705
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A SITUATION

02:45:48.772 --> 02:45:51.041
HERE WHERE. YOU KNOW SOMETIMES

02:45:51.107 --> 02:45:52.142
YOU GOTTA STOP SOMETIMES YOU

02:45:52.208 --> 02:45:53.877
DON'T STOP WITH THIS GROUP HAS A

02:45:53.943 --> 02:45:54.944
STOP THAT GROUP DOESN'T HAVE TO

02:45:55.011 --> 02:45:56.946
STOP TYPE THING AND I JUST THINK

02:45:57.013 --> 02:45:58.748
THAT'S GONNA LEAD TO CONFUSION

02:45:58.815 --> 02:46:01.084
CONFUSION LEADS FOR DANGER SO

02:46:01.151 --> 02:46:02.385
FOR THAT REASON FOR THOSE

02:46:02.452 --> 02:46:05.088
REASONS I CANNOT BE SUPPORTER

02:46:05.155 --> 02:46:09.259
OF. TODAY THANK YOU. ANY OTHER

02:46:09.326 --> 02:46:12.862
COMMENTS. I'LL JUST MAKE MY

02:46:12.929 --> 02:46:14.064
COMMENT BEFORE YOU CLOSE WHICH

02:46:14.130 --> 02:46:16.066
IS I SUPPORTED THE PREVIOUS BILL

02:46:16.132 --> 02:46:18.001
AND I WAS SORRY TO SEE IT BE

02:46:18.068 --> 02:46:18.902
TOWED YOU KNOW I'VE SEEN THAT

02:46:18.968 --> 02:46:21.338
READ THAT 96% OF CYCLISTS

02:46:21.404 --> 02:46:22.839
ALREADY USE THESE ROLLING STOPS

02:46:22.906 --> 02:46:23.940
AND THAT SHOWS YOU THAT THERE'S

02:46:24.007 --> 02:46:24.774
SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE WAY

02:46:24.841 --> 02:46:26.242
THAT WE'VE ENGINEERED OUR

02:46:26.309 --> 02:46:27.777
STREETS FOR CYCLISTS BECAUSE IT

02:46:27.844 --> 02:46:29.112
IS NOT JUST DIFFICULT TO

02:46:29.179 --> 02:46:30.613
CONSTANTLY COME TO A COMPLETE

02:46:30.680 --> 02:46:31.681
STOP WHEN YOU'RE ON A BICYCLE

02:46:31.748 --> 02:46:34.117
AND PUT YOUR FOOT DOWN. BUT IN

02:46:34.184 --> 02:46:35.051
SOME CASES DANGEROUS BECAUSE IT

02:46:35.118 --> 02:46:36.486
IT YOU HAVE THAT YOU'RE BECAUSE

02:46:36.553 --> 02:46:38.355
YOU'RE SO MUCH SLOWER WHEN

02:46:38.421 --> 02:46:38.855
YOU'RE MOVING INTO THE

02:46:38.922 --> 02:46:40.056
INTERSECTION AND I THINK THAT

02:46:40.123 --> 02:46:41.958
LEGALIZING THIS NOT ONLY STOPS

02:46:42.025 --> 02:46:44.661
OF. THE THESEVERY PUNITIVE

02:46:44.728 --> 02:46:46.296
TICKETS THAT ARE GIVEN SOMETIMES

02:46:46.363 --> 02:46:48.732
FOR THIS- AND IT WOULD ALLOW-

02:46:48.798 --> 02:46:50.767
THE POLICE TO FOCUS ON THE TRULY

02:46:50.834 --> 02:46:51.835
DANGEROUS. BEHAVIOR FROM

02:46:51.901 --> 02:46:54.003
CYCLISTS. BUT ALSO GIVES CARS

02:46:54.070 --> 02:46:55.105
MORE CERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT THEY

02:46:55.171 --> 02:46:57.440
SHOULD EXPECT IN TERMS OF

02:46:57.507 --> 02:46:59.175
CYCLIST BEHAVIOR- SO. I AM

02:46:59.242 --> 02:47:01.044

02:47:01.111 --> 02:47:01.945

02:47:03.880 --> 02:47:05.515
BACK TO US. EVEN THOUGH IT'S IN

02:47:05.582 --> 02:47:07.951
A DIFFERENT FORM WITH THAT I

02:47:08.017 --> 02:47:08.818

ALL YOUR QUESTIONS- THE REALITY

02:47:13.056 --> 02:47:14.924
IS- FROM WHAT THE OPPOSITION

02:47:14.991 --> 02:47:16.960
SAID. WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING

02:47:17.026 --> 02:47:18.995
NOTHING TO MAKE CYCLING AND

02:47:19.062 --> 02:47:19.863
INTERSECTIONS SAFER FOR

02:47:19.929 --> 02:47:22.465
CYCLISTS. OF THE DELAWARE YIELD

02:47:22.532 --> 02:47:24.501
SPECIFICALLY USES YIELDING NOT

02:47:24.567 --> 02:47:25.268
ROLLING THROUGH AND APPLYING

02:47:25.335 --> 02:47:27.103
THROUGH STOP SIGNS. AS A VERY

02:47:27.170 --> 02:47:28.905
SAFE TECHNIQUE THEY DID A PILOT.

02:47:28.972 --> 02:47:30.673
STATEWIDE AND DELAWARE IS A

02:47:30.740 --> 02:47:32.008
SMALL STATE BUT WASHINGTON ALSO

02:47:32.075 --> 02:47:34.177
HAS OF A SEATTLE WHICH IS A VERY

02:47:34.244 --> 02:47:35.545
URBAN AREA. AND THE OVERSIGHT

02:47:35.612 --> 02:47:37.414
23% REDUCTION AND BIKE CAR

02:47:37.480 --> 02:47:38.214
COLLISIONS AT THOSE

02:47:38.281 --> 02:47:40.517
INTERSECTIONS. SO ASSEMBLY

02:47:40.583 --> 02:47:41.918
MEMBER NECESSARY AND WE LIMITED

02:47:41.985 --> 02:47:43.787
THE BELT TO ONLY TWO LANE ROADS

02:47:43.853 --> 02:47:45.455
WHERE THEY'RE AT- STOP SIGNS AT

02:47:45.522 --> 02:47:47.857
ALL- CORNERS. SO THIS WHEN

02:47:47.924 --> 02:47:49.359
APPLIED AT BLIND INTERSECTIONS

02:47:49.426 --> 02:47:50.727
OR TO A STOP STORY OF A

02:47:50.794 --> 02:47:52.262
THOROUGHFARE THIS WOULD WOULDN'T

02:47:52.328 --> 02:47:54.431
LIMIT IT TO WHAT DELAWARE DINES

02:47:54.497 --> 02:47:55.832
AT THE DELAWARE YOU KNOW THAT

02:47:55.899 --> 02:47:57.500
WE- MARK PROXIMITY THAT. THE

02:47:57.567 --> 02:47:58.802
REASON YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH

02:47:58.868 --> 02:48:00.303
REGIONALIZATION RESENT

02:48:00.370 --> 02:48:01.771
REGIONALIZATION SO SAY WE WANT

02:48:01.838 --> 02:48:03.640
TO JUST DO A PILOT SAN DIEGO

02:48:03.706 --> 02:48:05.208
COUNTY RIGHT YOU'RE LIKE TASHA

02:48:05.275 --> 02:48:06.709
FROM SAN DIEGO. THEY ALL LIKE

02:48:06.776 --> 02:48:08.511
BIKING OF SAN DIEGO MAYBE THEY

02:48:08.578 --> 02:48:10.413
SHOULD DO THAT WE CONSIDER THIS

02:48:10.480 --> 02:48:11.047
OPTION THE PROBLEM ISN'T COMING

02:48:11.114 --> 02:48:12.515
FROM LA. DOESN'T EXPECT A

02:48:12.582 --> 02:48:13.683
BICYCLIST TO YIELD IN SAN DIEGO

02:48:13.750 --> 02:48:14.717
COUNTY AND THEY COME DOWN.

02:48:14.784 --> 02:48:15.752
YOU'RE NOT INCREASING THE SAFETY

02:48:15.819 --> 02:48:17.821
OF THE BICYCLIST. YOU HAVE TO DO

02:48:17.887 --> 02:48:19.255
IT STATEWIDE SO THE OF

02:48:19.322 --> 02:48:20.123
PREDICTABILITY. WE HAVE RULES

02:48:20.190 --> 02:48:22.025
THAT TO CLEARLY DIFFERENTIATE AT

02:48:22.091 --> 02:48:23.860
EIGHTEEN. EIGHTEEN AND BELOW

02:48:23.927 --> 02:48:25.295
HAVE TO WEAR A HELMET. WE

02:48:25.361 --> 02:48:27.430
CLEARLY HAVE RULES AND CYCLING

02:48:27.497 --> 02:48:29.999
AROUND WHAT MINERS ARE REQUIRED

02:48:30.066 --> 02:48:31.668
TO DO AND WHAT ADULTS ARE

02:48:31.734 --> 02:48:33.570
ALLOWED TO DO. AND THIS WAS SAY

02:48:33.636 --> 02:48:35.839
THIS PILOT WILL BE AROUND ADULTS

02:48:35.905 --> 02:48:36.706
AND THEREFORE YOU GIVE THE

02:48:36.773 --> 02:48:38.875
PREDICTABILITY. TO DRIVERS A

02:48:38.942 --> 02:48:40.977
WHAT THE BICYCLIST BEHAVIOR S.

02:48:41.044 --> 02:48:42.946
AND THAT IS THE KEY THAT RESOLVE

02:48:43.012 --> 02:48:45.148
THIS 23% REDUCTION AND BIKE CAR

02:48:45.215 --> 02:48:47.217
COLLISIONS. IN DELAWARE AND I

02:48:47.283 --> 02:48:48.718
THINK IF WE DO THIS AND WE DO

02:48:48.785 --> 02:48:51.354
THE SIX ARE PROBABLY WE'RE GONNA

02:48:51.421 --> 02:48:52.522
SEE THE SAME DATA. IN FACT THE

02:48:52.589 --> 02:48:53.823
NATIONAL PHONE TO GET THE

02:48:53.890 --> 02:48:55.425
APPRECIATION OF THE NATIONAL

02:48:55.492 --> 02:48:56.926
TRAFFIC. HEALTH AND SAFETY.

02:48:56.993 --> 02:48:59.796
REPORT IS LISTED IN YOUR- BILL

02:48:59.863 --> 02:49:01.998
ANALYSIS HAS THE SCENE THERE HAS

02:49:02.065 --> 02:49:04.834
BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASE. IN

02:49:04.901 --> 02:49:10.340
THE EIGHT STATES THAT HAVE. THIS

02:49:10.406 --> 02:49:10.874
LAW. THEY HAVE NOT SEEN AN

02:49:10.940 --> 02:49:13.109
INCREASE AND BY CAR COLLISION IF

02:49:13.176 --> 02:49:14.310
ANYTHING THEY'VE SEEN A- IT'S

02:49:14.377 --> 02:49:15.645
NOT THAT. THING BECAUSE WE'RE

02:49:15.712 --> 02:49:16.679
LACKING DATA ONE THING OUR BILL

02:49:16.746 --> 02:49:19.415

COMMUNITY AND OUR- TRAFFIC

02:49:23.353 --> 02:49:25.288
COMMUNITY SO THAT WE CAN SAY

02:49:25.355 --> 02:49:26.856
THIS ACTUALLY REDUCES IT I WILL

02:49:26.923 --> 02:49:28.691
NOT RUN THIS BILL. IF I THOUGHT

02:49:28.758 --> 02:49:30.593

TO SAY THAT- I UNDERSTAND THAT.

03:15:56.678 --> 03:15:58.012
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE NERVOUS

03:15:58.079 --> 03:15:59.714
ABOUT THIS BUT ALSO AS SOMEONE

03:15:59.781 --> 03:16:00.715
WHO WALKS THERE ARE PLENTY OF

03:16:00.782 --> 03:16:02.784
TIMES WHEN BECAUSE OUR ROADS ARE

03:16:02.851 --> 03:16:04.919
OFTEN NOT DESIGNED OR ENGINEERED

03:16:04.986 --> 03:16:06.955
FOR PEDESTRIANS IT'S VERY VERY

03:16:07.021 --> 03:16:09.457
DIFFICULT. TO COMPLY WITH SOME

03:16:09.524 --> 03:16:11.025
OF THE TRAFFIC RULES THERE BEEN

03:16:11.092 --> 03:16:12.861
TIMES WHERE I'VE HAD TO WALK

03:16:12.927 --> 03:16:13.895
SOMETIMES AND IF EVER IF I WAS

03:16:13.962 --> 03:16:15.964
NOT GOING TO J. WALK. AFTER WALK

03:16:16.030 --> 03:16:17.632
A HALF A MILE OUT OF MY WAY

03:16:17.699 --> 03:16:19.534
BECAUSE THERE'S NO CROSS A LEGAL

03:16:19.601 --> 03:16:20.902
CROSSWALKS FOR INSTANCE IN AN

03:16:20.969 --> 03:16:22.470
AREA. THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I

03:16:22.537 --> 03:16:24.005
WALK AROUND THIS CITY WERE I

03:16:24.072 --> 03:16:25.206
FEEL UNSAFE STANDING ON A CORNER

03:16:25.273 --> 03:16:26.674
AT NIGHT WHERE I FEEL A LOT

03:16:26.741 --> 03:16:28.543
SAFER CROSSING WHEN I CAN SEE

03:16:28.610 --> 03:16:29.944
FOR MILES AT THERE'S NO CARS

03:16:30.011 --> 03:16:31.746
AROUND. BUT I'M A WOMAN WALKING

03:16:31.813 --> 03:16:34.516
BY MYSELF IN DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO

03:16:34.582 --> 03:16:36.417
AND I'D RATHER JUST KEEP MOVING

03:16:36.484 --> 03:16:37.986
SO THERE'S REALLY GOOD REASONS

03:16:38.052 --> 03:16:38.786
WHY SOMETIMES PEDESTRIANS ARE

03:16:38.853 --> 03:16:41.489
SAFER- BY USING THEIR COMMON

03:16:41.556 --> 03:16:43.691
SENSE- ESPECIALLY WHEN THE

03:16:43.758 --> 03:16:45.226
STREETS ARE NOT DESIGNED FOR

03:16:45.293 --> 03:16:47.028
THEM SO WHEN WE GET TO THE POINT

03:16:47.095 --> 03:16:49.097
WHERE WE DESIGN ALL OF OUR

03:16:49.164 --> 03:16:50.031
STREETS FOR PEDESTRIANS AND HAVE

03:16:50.098 --> 03:16:50.932
CONVENIENT SAFE CROSSWALKS

03:16:50.999 --> 03:16:51.933
EVERYWHERE. AND LIGHTED AREAS

03:16:52.000 --> 03:16:53.868
AND YOU KNOW THEN I THINK IT'S A

03:16:53.935 --> 03:16:55.737
DIFFERENT STORY BUT RIGHT NOW WE

03:16:55.803 --> 03:16:57.772
REALLY PENALIZE ARE PEDESTRIANS-

03:16:57.839 --> 03:16:59.541
MANY MANY TIMES BY THE LACK OF

03:16:59.607 --> 03:17:01.543
GOOD ENGINEERING FOR THEM AND WE

03:17:01.609 --> 03:17:02.977
SHOULD ALLOW THEM TO USE THEIR

03:17:03.044 --> 03:17:04.579
COMMON SENSE SO I REALLY.

03:17:04.646 --> 03:17:05.713

RIGHT HERE SIR. YEAH MY NAME IS

03:31:28.342 --> 03:31:29.843
STEVE BARROW I'M THE STATE

03:31:29.910 --> 03:31:31.545
PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR THE

03:31:31.612 --> 03:31:32.046
CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR

03:31:32.112 --> 03:31:33.747
CHILDREN'S SAFETY AND HEALTH. I

03:31:33.814 --> 03:31:35.916
WAS IN THE M. T. TWO PARAMEDIC

03:31:35.983 --> 03:31:37.351
AND JUST FOR FULL DISCLOSURE I

03:31:37.418 --> 03:31:41.355
SAID ON OUR STATE CMS COMMISSION

03:31:41.422 --> 03:31:42.356
- THE TWO QUESTIONS THAT WERE

03:31:42.423 --> 03:31:44.691
ASKED- NEW JERSEY HAS ENTERED IS

03:31:44.758 --> 03:31:46.760
A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF A STATE

03:31:46.827 --> 03:31:48.929
THAT HAS. MOVED ITS YEAH IT'S

03:31:48.996 --> 03:31:51.565
GDL PROGRAM COMPONENTS UP.

03:31:51.632 --> 03:31:53.367
THROUGH AGE TWENTY AND THEY'VE

03:31:53.434 --> 03:31:56.270
HAD A REMARKABLE- READ REDUCTION

03:31:56.336 --> 03:31:58.505
JUST LIKE THE RESEARCH SHOWS. IN

03:31:58.572 --> 03:32:00.808
THE NUMBER OF FATAL CRASHES AS

03:32:00.874 --> 03:32:03.343
WAS STATED. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

03:32:03.410 --> 03:32:04.545
AND TWENTY YEAR OLDS WITHOUT GDL

03:32:04.611 --> 03:32:08.082
HAVE 4260% HIGHER. FATAL CRASH

03:32:08.148 --> 03:32:09.783
RATES THAT'S PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

03:32:09.850 --> 03:32:10.951
IN OUR STATE THAT TRANSLATES

03:32:11.018 --> 03:32:13.220
INTO AN EXTRA FIVE HUNDRED-

03:32:13.287 --> 03:32:15.189
YOUTH IN THE GROUND IN THE BOX.

03:32:15.255 --> 03:32:17.791
AND SO IT IT DOES DOES MAKE

03:32:17.858 --> 03:32:20.160
QUITE A BIT OF A DIFFERENCE. ON

03:32:20.227 --> 03:32:22.563
THE OTHER ISSUE THAT THIS BILL

03:32:22.629 --> 03:32:25.999
ADDRESSES IS THAT. WHEN I WAS

03:32:26.066 --> 03:32:26.834
YOUNG. WE USED TO GET OUR

03:32:26.900 --> 03:32:28.936
LICENSE WHEN WE WERE FIFTEEN

03:32:29.002 --> 03:32:29.736
SIXTEEN YEARS OLD SEVENTEEN

03:32:29.803 --> 03:32:33.507
YEARS OLD. 45% OF OUR YOUNG

03:32:33.574 --> 03:32:34.875
PEOPLE DO NOT GET THEIR LICENSE

03:32:34.942 --> 03:32:36.844
UNTIL EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND

03:32:36.910 --> 03:32:39.313
TWENTY. AND SO THERE THEY DON'T

03:32:39.379 --> 03:32:41.815
GET THE BENEFIT OF ANY OF THE

03:32:41.882 --> 03:32:43.951
TRAINING THE BILL DOES. TAKEN TO

03:32:44.017 --> 03:32:46.019
A APPRECIATION THAT WE'RE

03:32:46.086 --> 03:32:47.754
DEALING WITH YOUNG ADULTS

03:32:47.821 --> 03:32:49.256
THEY'RE NO LONGER TEENAGERS ARE

03:32:49.323 --> 03:32:52.726
MOVING INTO ADULTHOOD. SO THE

03:32:52.793 --> 03:32:53.961
BURDEN OF PROVISIONAL LICENSE

03:32:54.027 --> 03:32:56.363
PERIOD THE DRIVER EDUCATION

03:32:56.430 --> 03:32:58.031
PERIOD EVERYTHING IS CONDENSED

03:32:58.098 --> 03:32:59.666
THE OTHER THING THAT WE'VE

03:32:59.733 --> 03:33:02.302
ADDRESSED- TO SPEAK TO. OUR

03:33:02.369 --> 03:33:03.337
ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL'S

03:33:03.403 --> 03:33:08.742
ISSUE IS THAT- IS OUR LOW INCOME

03:33:08.809 --> 03:33:10.077
THERE IS A PROVISION IN THIS

03:33:10.144 --> 03:33:12.045
BILL THAT DOESN'T EXIST IN JUDY

03:33:12.112 --> 03:33:13.680
ALL RIGHT NOW AND THAT SAYS IF

03:33:13.747 --> 03:33:16.550
YOU'RE FROM A LOW INCOME. FAMILY

03:33:16.617 --> 03:33:18.552
THIS IS A TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR

03:33:18.619 --> 03:33:20.854
EFFORT TO GET THROUGH GDL ALL

03:33:20.921 --> 03:33:22.990

OVER TWELVE MONTHS NO FEES NO

03:33:29.129 --> 03:33:30.397
INTEREST RATES. SO YOU CAN

03:33:30.464 --> 03:33:32.633
SPREAD THAT OUT AND I WOULD ASK

03:33:32.699 --> 03:33:35.502
YOU TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION.

03:33:35.569 --> 03:33:37.171
IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET A LICENSE

03:33:37.237 --> 03:33:38.872
. GETTING TRAINED TO BE A SAFER

03:33:38.939 --> 03:33:40.841
DRIVERS NOT THE BIGGEST COST.

03:33:40.908 --> 03:33:42.943
THE BIGGEST COST TO YOU IS GOING

03:33:43.010 --> 03:33:45.045
TO BE OWNING A CAR PAY FOR GAS

03:33:45.112 --> 03:33:46.780
PARKING INSURANCE. MAINTAINING

03:33:46.847 --> 03:33:50.017

03:38:11.211 --> 03:38:13.079
AND THIS IS THE COMPANION PIECE

03:38:13.146 --> 03:38:15.482
TO THIS WHICH HAS TO DO WITH HOW

03:38:15.549 --> 03:38:19.486
TO ALLOW OUR CITIES TO HAVE MORE

03:38:19.553 --> 03:38:21.488
FLEXIBILITY IN HOW THEY ENFORCE

03:38:21.555 --> 03:38:22.889
OUR SPEED LIMITS WHAT THIS BILL

03:38:22.956 --> 03:38:24.591
DOES IS WITH A PILOT PROGRAM IN

03:38:24.658 --> 03:38:26.159
A SMALL NUMBER OF CITIES IT

03:38:26.226 --> 03:38:29.329
WOULD ALLOW FOR CAMERAS IN. IN

03:38:29.396 --> 03:38:31.331
CERTAIN LOCATIONS BEING IN HIGH

03:38:31.398 --> 03:38:32.599
INJURY NETWORKS OR WHERE THERE

03:38:32.666 --> 03:38:34.734
IS VULNERABLE POPULATIONS TO

03:38:34.801 --> 03:38:37.204
ENFORCE SPEED LIMITS USING SPEED

03:38:37.270 --> 03:38:39.372
CAMERAS NOW THERE ARE MULTIPLE

03:38:39.439 --> 03:38:41.475
SAFEGUARDS EMBEDDED IN THIS BILL

03:38:41.541 --> 03:38:42.576
FOR INSTANCE YOU HAVE TO BE

03:38:42.642 --> 03:38:44.144
GOING AT LEAST ELEVEN MILES AN

03:38:44.211 --> 03:38:45.679
HOUR OVER THE SPEED LIMIT

03:38:45.745 --> 03:38:46.680
BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE

03:38:46.746 --> 03:38:48.215
MORE EGREGIOUS DRIVERS. THE

03:38:48.281 --> 03:38:50.317
MONEY THAT'S GENERATED IN FINES

03:38:50.383 --> 03:38:52.018
HAS TO GO RIGHT BACK INTO THAT

03:38:52.085 --> 03:38:54.154
VERY SAME COMMUNITY FOR PHYSICAL

03:38:54.221 --> 03:38:55.288
INFRASTRUCTURE TO MAKE THOSE

03:38:55.355 --> 03:38:56.857
ROADS SAFER SO IT GENERATES

03:38:56.923 --> 03:38:58.625
REVENUE NOT FOR GENERAL FUND NOT

03:38:58.692 --> 03:38:59.993
NIPPED UNITIVE WAY BUT TO

03:39:00.060 --> 03:39:01.528
ACTUALLY DO IMPROVEMENTS ON

03:39:01.595 --> 03:39:03.396
THOSE DANGEROUS ROADS. THE

03:39:03.463 --> 03:39:04.731
TICKETS ARE IN THE BEGINNING OF

03:39:04.798 --> 03:39:06.399
THE OF WHEN THE CAMERAS ARE

03:39:06.466 --> 03:39:08.101
DEPLOYED OR WARNINGS TO PEOPLE

03:39:08.168 --> 03:39:09.803
AND THEN WHEN WE START TO GIVE

03:39:09.870 --> 03:39:10.971
THEM THEIR FIFTY DOLLAR TICKET

03:39:11.037 --> 03:39:12.072
THEY STARTED FIFTY DOLLARS

03:39:12.138 --> 03:39:13.773
COMPARE THAT TO A REGULAR SPEED

03:39:13.840 --> 03:39:15.408
LIMIT THAT'S REGULAR SPEED

03:39:15.475 --> 03:39:17.377
TICKET GIVEN BY AN OFFICER WHICH

03:39:17.444 --> 03:39:19.212
CAN BE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS. THE

03:39:19.279 --> 03:39:21.214
TICKET GOES TO THE CAR KIND OF

03:39:21.281 --> 03:39:23.016
LIKE A PARKING TICKET SO IT

03:39:23.083 --> 03:39:25.285
THERE'S NO POINT IN ANYONE'S

03:39:25.352 --> 03:39:26.786
LICENSE- BUT IT DOES NOTIFY

03:39:26.853 --> 03:39:29.089
PARENTS THAT THEIR CHILDREN MAY

03:39:29.155 --> 03:39:30.757
BE ARE EGREGIOUSLY SPEEDING OR

03:39:30.824 --> 03:39:32.325
RECKLESSLY DRIVING WHEN THEY

03:39:32.392 --> 03:39:34.528
MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE KNOW SO WE

03:39:34.594 --> 03:39:36.129
HAVE TRIED TO BUILD EQUITY AND

03:39:36.196 --> 03:39:38.131
SAFEGUARDS AND GUARD RAILS INTO

03:39:38.198 --> 03:39:39.966
THIS PROGRAM I NEVER REALLY DONE

03:39:40.033 --> 03:39:41.868
THIS AND ALSO THE CITIES HAVE TO

03:39:41.935 --> 03:39:43.770
WARN PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE COMING

03:39:43.837 --> 03:39:45.171
INTO HIS OWN OR THE SPEED

03:39:45.238 --> 03:39:46.873
CAMERAS ARE BEING USED. BECAUSE

03:39:46.940 --> 03:39:48.708
OUR INTENTION IS TO TAKE THE

03:39:48.775 --> 03:39:49.809
MOST DANGEROUS STREETS IN A

03:39:49.876 --> 03:39:52.846
COMMUNITY AND SLOW PEOPLE DOWN

03:39:52.913 --> 03:39:53.847
IT'S NOT TO PUNITIVE REALLY MOVE

03:39:53.914 --> 03:39:55.916
AROUND THE CITY AND GET TICKETS

03:39:55.982 --> 03:39:57.384
OUT. IT'S TO ACTUALLY IMPROVE ON

03:39:57.450 --> 03:39:59.719
THE SAFETY OF THOSE ROADS AGAIN

03:39:59.786 --> 03:40:01.321
THIS IS A PILOT PROGRAM TO

03:40:01.388 --> 03:40:03.290
COLLECT DATA ON IT. WE KNOW IN

03:40:03.356 --> 03:40:04.724
OTHER CITIES WHEN THIS HAS BEEN

03:40:04.791 --> 03:40:06.927
USED IN OTHER STATES THAT IT HAS

03:40:06.993 --> 03:40:08.628
SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED. THE

03:40:08.695 --> 03:40:10.630
NUMBER OF DRIVERS THAT ARE

03:40:10.697 --> 03:40:12.732
RECKLESSLY DRIVING AND SPEEDING.

03:40:12.799 --> 03:40:14.734
IT'S PERFECT TO USE IN AREAS

03:40:14.801 --> 03:40:16.970
WHERE WE HAVE STREET RACING WE

03:40:17.037 --> 03:40:18.438
ALL KNOW THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS

03:40:18.505 --> 03:40:19.839
GOOD AS THEY ARE CAN'T BE

03:40:19.906 --> 03:40:21.308
EVERYWHERE AT ONCE. AND IT'S

03:40:21.374 --> 03:40:22.943
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE GIVE

03:40:23.009 --> 03:40:23.610
COMMUNITIES THE TOOLS THAT THEY

03:40:23.677 --> 03:40:26.646
NEED TO ENFORCE OUR LAWS. THIS

03:40:26.713 --> 03:40:28.648
IS DONE IN A NON PUNITIVE WAY I

03:40:28.715 --> 03:40:29.916
THINK IT'S SENSIBLE WE'VE BEEN

03:40:29.983 --> 03:40:30.884

PROHIBITS CITIES FROM USING THIS

OF CALIFORNIA OR TO BE A TOUCHY.

03:43:47.881 --> 03:43:50.683
EVERY YEAR OVER FOUR HUNDRED SAN

03:43:50.750 --> 03:43:51.885
FRANCISCANS ARE STRUCK BY A CAR

03:43:51.951 --> 03:43:54.521
WHILE WALKING. CYCLING OR RIDING

03:43:54.587 --> 03:43:56.456
A TRANSPORTATION DEVICE. AND

03:43:56.523 --> 03:43:58.391
THAT MEANS THAT EVERY DAY THE

03:43:58.458 --> 03:44:00.059
TRAUMA SURGERY TEAM AT SAN

03:44:00.126 --> 03:44:02.061

03:44:02.128 --> 03:44:04.597
PEDESTRIAN OR A CYCLIST WHO WAS

03:44:04.664 --> 03:44:07.167
HIT BY A CAR. FOR ME AND FOR MY

03:44:07.233 --> 03:44:07.967
TEAM THE IMPACT OF TRAFFIC

03:44:08.034 --> 03:44:10.270
VIOLENCE IS A REALITY THAT WE

03:44:10.336 --> 03:44:11.671
ENCOUNTER EVERY SINGLE DAY AT

03:44:11.738 --> 03:44:14.307
WORK. WE KNOW THAT HOW FAST OUR

03:44:14.374 --> 03:44:16.476
CARS TRAVELING MATTERS. SPEED

03:44:16.543 --> 03:44:18.511
AFFECT WHETHER THE VICTIM OF THE

03:44:18.578 --> 03:44:20.613
COLLISION LIVES OR DIES WHETHER

THEIR INJURIES ARE DEVASTATING

03:44:23.149 --> 03:44:25.251
OR RELATIVELY LIFESTYLE. AND I

03:44:25.318 --> 03:44:26.452
DON'T MEAN TO MINIMIZE THE

03:44:26.519 --> 03:44:27.620
IMPACT OF EVERY TRAFFIC

03:44:27.687 --> 03:44:29.322
COLLISION BECAUSE EACH ONE IS A

03:44:29.389 --> 03:44:31.291
TRAGEDY BUT AS A TRAUMA SURGEON

03:44:31.357 --> 03:44:33.193
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWENTY

AND THIRTY OR FORTY MILES PER

03:44:34.994 --> 03:44:35.962
HOUR CAN BE THE DIFFERENCE

03:44:36.029 --> 03:44:37.864
BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH OR THE

03:44:37.931 --> 03:44:39.732
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. BROKEN BONES

03:44:39.799 --> 03:44:42.902
AND THE DEVASTATING BRAIN INJURY

03:44:42.969 --> 03:44:43.937
OR INTERNAL BLEEDING. FOR

03:44:44.003 --> 03:44:45.572
PATIENTS WHO DO SURVIVE THEIR

03:44:45.638 --> 03:44:46.840
INJURIES MANY FACE A LONG

03:44:46.906 --> 03:44:48.908
RECOVERY AND SOME NEVER RETURNED

BILL BECAUSE IT WOULD

04:13:39.771 --> 04:13:41.472
REINVIGORATE CALIFORNIA'S

04:13:41.539 --> 04:13:42.874

04:13:42.941 --> 04:13:44.542

CLEAN MOBILITY. TO ALL OF OUR

04:13:46.511 --> 04:13:48.546
RESIDENTS IN THOSE EFFORTS HAVE

04:13:48.613 --> 04:13:50.281
NOT BEEN GOING WELL- AS THE

04:13:50.348 --> 04:13:52.283
AUTHOR SAID OUR TRANSPORTATION

04:13:52.350 --> 04:13:54.319
SPENDING IS OFTEN ACTUALLY

04:13:54.385 --> 04:13:56.487
ACROSS PURPOSES. WITH OUR

04:13:56.554 --> 04:13:58.656
EFFORTS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS. AND

04:13:58.723 --> 04:14:00.091
IN IN FACT TRANSPORTATION

04:14:00.158 --> 04:14:01.759
EMISSIONS ARE BY FAR THE BIGGEST

04:14:01.826 --> 04:14:02.927
SOURCE OF AIR POLLUTION IN

04:14:02.994 --> 04:14:04.596
CALIFORNIA AND THE BIGGEST

04:14:04.662 --> 04:14:05.697
SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE GAS

04:14:05.763 --> 04:14:07.198
EMISSIONS. POLLUTION FROM

04:14:07.265 --> 04:14:10.635
TRAFFIC KILLS MORE PEOPLE THAN

04:14:10.702 --> 04:14:12.670
TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS DO. AND THAT

04:14:12.737 --> 04:14:14.138
SHOULD BE MOTIVATION ENOUGH TO

04:14:14.205 --> 04:14:16.240
CHANGE WHAT WE'RE DOING- BUT

04:14:16.307 --> 04:14:18.209
THERE'S ALSO THE FACT THAT IF WE

04:14:18.276 --> 04:14:20.845
CONTINUE TO FAIL TO ACHIEVE

04:14:20.912 --> 04:14:22.480
NATIONAL AIR QUALITY STANDARDS

04:14:22.547 --> 04:14:23.948
IN CALIFORNIA. THE FEDERAL

04:14:24.015 --> 04:14:25.450
GOVERNMENT CAN TAKE AWAY ITS

04:14:25.516 --> 04:14:27.318
TRANSPORTATION FUNDING FROM THE

04:14:27.385 --> 04:14:30.555
STATE. SO THIS BILL WOULD SEEK

04:14:30.622 --> 04:14:33.391

04:14:33.458 --> 04:14:38.062

APPRECIATE THE- WORK AND EFFORT-

04:16:04.515 --> 04:16:06.584
THE- THAT TE AUTHORS DONE-

04:16:06.651 --> 04:16:08.853
UNFORTUNATELY THE AB TWO EIGHTY

04:16:08.920 --> 04:16:11.089
FIVE REPORT THAT SHE CITED AS

04:16:11.155 --> 04:16:12.623
THE BASIS FOR THIS BILL ON THIS

04:16:12.690 --> 04:16:15.059
ISSUE IS FLAWED AND INCONSISTENT

04:16:15.126 --> 04:16:17.929
WITH LAW IT SAYS THAT THERE ARE

04:16:17.995 --> 04:16:19.030
REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION

04:16:19.097 --> 04:16:20.465
IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS WHICH WE

04:16:20.531 --> 04:16:22.800
CALL TIPS ARE INCONSISTENT WITH

04:16:22.867 --> 04:16:24.235
OUR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION

04:16:24.302 --> 04:16:25.970
PLANS WHICH A WHAT WE CALL OUR

04:16:26.037 --> 04:16:29.040
TEEPEES. BECAUSE THE PERCENTAGE

04:16:29.107 --> 04:16:31.476
OF. INVESTMENT THAT WE'RE DOING

04:16:31.542 --> 04:16:33.978
FIRST TO ROADS TO TRANSIT. IT'S

04:16:34.045 --> 04:16:36.414
NOT THE SAME AS IT IS WITH OUR

04:16:36.481 --> 04:16:37.949
AND OUR OUR TEEPEES. THE PROBLEM

04:16:38.015 --> 04:16:40.318
IS IT'S NOT THE SAME DOLLARS.

04:16:40.384 --> 04:16:42.186
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE IN THE

04:16:42.253 --> 04:16:46.124
SCAD REGION. THE L. A. METROS

04:16:46.190 --> 04:16:48.126
OPERATION COSTS ARE IN YOUR RTP

04:16:48.192 --> 04:16:50.928
BUT THE HIP. SO OF COURSE THE

04:16:50.995 --> 04:16:52.864
TIP HASA BIGGER PERCENTAGE OF

04:16:52.930 --> 04:16:55.299
ROAD INVESTMENT IN IT. BECAUSE

04:16:55.366 --> 04:16:56.234
IT DOESN'T HAVE ALL THE

04:16:56.300 --> 04:16:58.202
OPERATING COSTS OF TRANSIT THE

04:16:58.269 --> 04:17:02.607
TDA FUNDS ARE IN. THE RTP BUT

04:17:02.673 --> 04:17:04.075
THEY'RE NOT IN THE TIP SO WHEN

04:17:04.142 --> 04:17:06.144
THIS BILL SAYS THAT IT NEEDS TO
