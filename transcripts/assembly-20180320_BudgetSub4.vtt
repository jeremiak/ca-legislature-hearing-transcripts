PROPOSALS AYE WITH REGARD TO THE

00:31:04.129 --> 00:31:06.465 region:rollup2
PRINTING PLANT DEMOLITION AND

00:31:05.363 --> 00:31:07.766 region:rollup2
I'M WE DON'T RAISE ANY ISSUES

00:31:06.465 --> 00:31:09.835 region:rollup2
WITH THAT WE DO THINK IT MAKES

00:31:07.766 --> 00:31:11.670 region:rollup2
SENSE TO DEMOLISH THAT BUILDING.

00:31:09.835 --> 00:31:13.205 region:rollup2
AND GIVEN THAT REGARDLESS OF

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:14.406 region:rollup2
WHAT THAT SITES USED FOR.

00:31:13.205 --> 00:31:16.341 region:rollup2
IT THAT PUBLIC DOES IT MAKE

00:31:14.406 --> 00:31:17.442 region:rollup2
SENSE TO HAVE THAT EXISTING

00:31:16.341 --> 00:31:19.144 region:rollup2
BUILDING ON THAT SITE.

00:31:17.442 --> 00:31:21.046 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WE ARE RECOMMENDING

00:31:24.683 --> 00:31:27.519 region:rollup2
THAT'S BECAUSE BASED ON OUR

00:31:26.051 --> 00:31:28.920 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT

00:31:27.519 --> 00:31:30.522 region:rollup2
THAT PROJECT IS A COST EFFECTIVE

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.690 region:rollup2
WAY FOR THE STATE TO MEET ITS

00:31:30.522 --> 00:31:33.692 region:rollup2
BUILDING MEANS. I'M SO

00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:36.561 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY WE ESTIMATED THE

00:31:33.692 --> 00:31:37.596 region:rollup2
COST OF THE COSTS OF BUILDING ON

00:31:36.561 --> 00:31:39.197 region:rollup2
AND MAINTAINING AN OPERATING

00:31:37.596 --> 00:31:41.233 region:rollup2

00:31:39.197 --> 00:31:42.234 region:rollup2
TO THE COSTS.

00:31:41.233 --> 00:31:43.535 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SAVINGS THAT WOULD.

00:31:42.234 --> 00:31:44.636 region:rollup2
RECRUITED THE STATE FROM NOT

00:31:43.535 --> 00:31:46.938 region:rollup2
HAVING TO LEASE.

00:31:44.636 --> 00:31:48.673 region:rollup2
THE EXISTING SPACE THAT THOSE

00:31:46.938 --> 00:31:50.208 region:rollup2
PATENT PERMITS ARE AND.

00:31:48.673 --> 00:31:51.476 region:rollup2
ALLAH WHEN WE COMPARED THOSE AND

00:31:50.208 --> 00:31:53.278 region:rollup2
LOOK AT HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE

00:31:51.476 --> 00:31:54.513 region:rollup2
FOR THIS STATE WITH COULD BREAK

00:31:53.278 --> 00:31:56.014 region:rollup2
EVEN. ON THE WE GOT A NUMBER

00:31:54.513 --> 00:31:57.516 region:rollup2
THAT WAS OVER EIGHTY YEARS AND

00:31:56.014 --> 00:31:58.116 region:rollup2
THAT'S RELATIVELY LONG WE THINK

00:31:57.516 --> 00:31:59.985 region:rollup2
THAT'S LONGER THAN THAT. LIKE

00:31:58.116 --> 00:32:01.620 region:rollup2
WE.

00:31:59.985 --> 00:32:03.321 region:rollup2
WIFE OF THE BUILDING AYE WE

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:03.855 region:rollup2
WOULD KNOW DID YES HAD A LOWER

00:32:03.321 --> 00:32:05.791 region:rollup2
NUMBER.

00:32:03.855 --> 00:32:07.125 region:rollup2
THEIR FEW DIFFERENCES IN OUR

00:32:05.791 --> 00:32:08.560 region:rollup2
CALCULATIONS.

00:32:07.125 --> 00:32:09.895 region:rollup2
AND WE THINK THAT THAT OUR

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:13.131 region:rollup2
NUMBERS MORE APPROPRIATE THE

00:32:09.895 --> 00:32:14.766 region:rollup2
COUPLE THE BIGGEST ONES ONE WAS.

00:32:13.131 --> 00:32:16.535 region:rollup2
THAT THEY DIDN'T DISCOUNT OF THE

00:32:14.766 --> 00:32:17.569 region:rollup2
CASH FLOWS AND WE THINK THAT'S

00:32:16.535 --> 00:32:19.738 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT TO DO DOING

00:32:17.569 --> 00:32:21.006 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGE THAT MONEY TODAY IS

00:32:19.738 --> 00:32:21.673 region:rollup2
WORTH MORE THAN THAN MONEY IN

00:32:21.006 --> 00:32:23.241 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE.

00:32:21.673 --> 00:32:23.975 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF INFLATION AND OTHER

00:32:23.241 --> 00:32:25.310 region:rollup2
FACTORS.

00:32:23.975 --> 00:32:27.112 region:rollup2
ALSO THERE SOME OTHER

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:28.814 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTIONS LIKE OUT WE THOUGHT

00:32:27.112 --> 00:32:31.249 region:rollup2
THAT THE ASSUMES THAT THE. A

00:32:28.814 --> 00:32:34.653 region:rollup2
RATE OF INCREASE IN MANAGEMENT.

00:32:31.249 --> 00:32:36.755 region:rollup2
AND OPERATIONS COSTS WAS TOO

00:32:34.653 --> 00:32:39.324 region:rollup2
LOW THEY ASSUMED OF LESS THAN

00:32:36.755 --> 00:32:40.992 region:rollup2
ONE PERCENT INCREASE YOUR PRE

00:32:39.324 --> 00:32:43.228 region:rollup2
YEAR THERE WAS A POINT FIVE

00:32:40.992 --> 00:32:45.330 region:rollup2
PERCENT SAID WE ADJUSTED THOSE.

00:32:43.228 --> 00:32:47.499 region:rollup2
THOSE ASSUMPTIONS WE GOT OVER

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:50.969 region:rollup2
EIGHTY YEARS WE THINK THAT THAT.

00:32:47.499 --> 00:32:53.672 region:rollup2
SUGGEST THAT IT'S NOT A VERY A

00:32:50.969 --> 00:32:54.172 region:rollup2
COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO MEET THE

00:32:53.672 --> 00:32:54.873 region:rollup2
STATE'S BUILDING NEEDS.

00:32:54.172 --> 00:32:55.507 region:rollup2
I'M SO NOTABLY WE RECOMMEND THAT

00:32:54.873 --> 00:32:56.141 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE NOT APPROVE THE

00:32:55.507 --> 00:32:56.741 region:rollup2
FUNDING AND INSTEAD DIRECTS THE

00:32:56.141 --> 00:32:57.409 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION TO COME FORWARD

00:32:56.741 --> 00:32:58.243 region:rollup2
WITH AN ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL. ON

00:32:57.409 --> 00:32:59.845 region:rollup2
THAT COULD BE A DIFFERENT

00:32:58.243 --> 00:33:01.813 region:rollup2
BUILDING ON THE SITE IT COULD BE

00:32:59.845 --> 00:33:03.615 region:rollup2
SELLING THE SITE. ON THERE

00:33:01.813 --> 00:33:04.649 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY EVEREADY OF OPTIONS

00:33:03.615 --> 00:33:06.184 region:rollup2
AYE WE'RE ALSO RECOMMENDING THAT

00:33:04.649 --> 00:33:07.085 region:rollup2
THE ADMINISTRATION PROVIDE

00:33:06.184 --> 00:33:09.821 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE

00:33:07.085 --> 00:33:11.223 region:rollup2
SEQUENCING PLAN SO. BOTH THE

00:33:09.821 --> 00:33:12.090 region:rollup2
RICHARDS BOULEVARD PROJECT AS

00:33:11.223 --> 00:33:13.391 region:rollup2
WELL AS THE TWO RENOVATION

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:15.060 region:rollup2
PROJECT THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT

00:33:13.391 --> 00:33:16.995 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ALL PART. OF THIS

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:18.697 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO SERVE STRATEGY THAT

00:33:16.995 --> 00:33:20.131 region:rollup2
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS AND. DIRT

00:33:18.697 --> 00:33:22.534 region:rollup2
THAT STRATEGY IS.

00:33:20.131 --> 00:33:25.570 region:rollup2
PRETTY ARE INTERCONNECTED AND

00:33:22.534 --> 00:33:27.138 region:rollup2
LINKED SO MANY CASES OTHER

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:28.773 region:rollup2
SERVICE SEQUENCE OF RENOVATION

00:33:27.138 --> 00:33:29.241 region:rollup2
YOUR NEW CONSTRUCTION AND

00:33:28.773 --> 00:33:30.442 region:rollup2
RENOVATION PROJECTS.

00:33:29.241 --> 00:33:33.278 region:rollup2
I'M SO WE THINK IT'S WORTH

00:33:30.442 --> 00:33:35.046 region:rollup2
HAVING MORE INFORMATION ON. WHAT

00:33:33.278 --> 00:33:36.581 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVES MIGHT BE TO THE

00:33:35.046 --> 00:33:38.450 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN SO FOR

00:33:36.581 --> 00:33:39.784 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE HE DIDN'T MOVE FORWARD

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:41.219 region:rollup2
WITH RICHARD BOULEVARD PROJECT?

00:33:39.784 --> 00:33:42.687 region:rollup2
ON WHAT ARE SOME OTHER OPTIONS

00:33:41.219 --> 00:33:43.955 region:rollup2
THAT YOU COULD PURSUE. I'M

00:33:42.687 --> 00:33:46.057 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE PARTIES

00:33:43.955 --> 00:33:48.093 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE HOUSE.

00:33:46.057 --> 00:33:50.462 region:rollup2
AND THEN FINALLY. OVER

00:33:48.093 --> 00:33:52.697 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDING ABOUT IT YES REPORT

00:33:50.462 --> 00:33:53.832 region:rollup2
ON THE RENOVATION PROJECT THAT

00:33:52.697 --> 00:33:55.333 region:rollup2
YOU HEARD THEIR TO PROPOSED

00:33:53.832 --> 00:33:56.635 region:rollup2
RENOVATIONS PROJECTS THAT BATES

00:33:55.333 --> 00:33:58.403 region:rollup2
AND PROJECT.

00:33:56.635 --> 00:34:01.640 region:rollup2
I AND I'M ARE PROJECTS WE DO

00:33:58.403 --> 00:34:02.107 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO REPAIR

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.341 region:rollup2
AND RENOVATE THOSE TWO

00:34:02.107 --> 00:34:04.442 region:rollup2
BUILDINGS.

00:34:03.341 --> 00:34:06.244 region:rollup2
ARE THEY BOTH HAVE VERY

00:34:04.442 --> 00:34:07.545 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS

00:34:06.244 --> 00:34:09.214 region:rollup2
BASIN SOLELY CONDITION

00:34:07.545 --> 00:34:10.548 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT THAT WERE CONDUCTED A

00:34:09.214 --> 00:34:12.951 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THEY WERE

00:34:10.548 --> 00:34:14.553 region:rollup2
BOTH ASSESSED TO BE AN IMPORT

00:34:12.951 --> 00:34:16.521 region:rollup2
CONDITION AND HAVE. I'M SOME

00:34:14.553 --> 00:34:17.989 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL ISSUES SO WE THINK

00:34:16.521 --> 00:34:19.257 region:rollup2
IT'S CERTAINLY REASONABLE. BUT

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:20.325 region:rollup2
TO PURSUE SOME RENOVATIONS OF

00:34:19.257 --> 00:34:21.993 region:rollup2
THOSE PROJECTS.

00:34:20.325 --> 00:34:23.695 region:rollup2
WE DO KNOW THAT WE THINK THAT

00:34:21.993 --> 00:34:25.430 region:rollup2
THE PRESSURE COSTS APPEAR TO BE.

00:34:23.695 --> 00:34:28.867 region:rollup2
UP PRETTY HIGH THEIR HIGHER THAN

00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:29.501 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE PREVIOUS BUILDING

00:34:28.867 --> 00:34:29.701 region:rollup2
HUNDRED HAITIANS THAT THE STATE

00:34:29.501 --> 00:34:31.369 region:rollup2
HAS.

00:34:29.701 --> 00:34:32.938 region:rollup2
HAS ENGAGED IN INCLUDING THE

00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:33.572 region:rollup2
LIBRARIAN COURTS AS WELL AS

00:34:32.938 --> 00:34:35.173 region:rollup2
OFFICE BUILDING EIGHT AND NINE

00:34:33.572 --> 00:34:37.208 region:rollup2
AND THOSE WERE. A COUPLE OF THE

00:34:35.173 --> 00:34:37.676 region:rollup2
MOST RECENT OF A SIGNIFICANT

00:34:37.208 --> 00:34:38.777 region:rollup2
INNOVATONS THE STATE'S

00:34:37.676 --> 00:34:40.312 region:rollup2
UNDERTAKEN.

00:34:38.777 --> 00:34:41.780 region:rollup2
I'M SO I THINK IT'S WORTH HAVING

00:34:40.312 --> 00:34:42.380 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:44.049 region:rollup2
REASONS FOR THE COSTS AS WELL

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:46.017 region:rollup2
AS.

00:34:44.049 --> 00:34:47.352 region:rollup2
CAN REPORT ON SOME POTENTIAL

00:34:46.017 --> 00:34:48.620 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE SCOPES THAT MIGHT BE

00:34:47.352 --> 00:34:55.527 region:rollup2
MORE COST EFFECTIVE.

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:56.828 region:rollup2
FINANCE.

00:34:55.527 --> 00:34:59.364 region:rollup2
SILICON.

00:34:56.828 --> 00:35:00.832 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL.

00:34:59.364 --> 00:35:02.233 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

00:35:00.832 --> 00:35:03.868 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION AND FOR THE

00:35:02.233 --> 00:35:05.971 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS I GUESS.

00:35:03.868 --> 00:35:07.639 region:rollup2
IT WILL AND I'D LIKE TO GET A

00:35:05.971 --> 00:35:10.475 region:rollup2
SENSE FOR.

00:35:07.639 --> 00:35:13.178 region:rollup2
IT THE GREAT COUNTY WHERE.

00:35:10.475 --> 00:35:14.879 region:rollup2
DEED YES SEIZE THE STATE GOING

00:35:13.178 --> 00:35:16.581 region:rollup2
IN REGARDS TO BUILDINGS UP AND

00:35:14.879 --> 00:35:17.649 region:rollup2
RENTAL SPACE BECAUSE.

00:35:16.581 --> 00:35:20.552 region:rollup2
BACK.

00:35:17.649 --> 00:35:22.787 region:rollup2
A FEW YEARS AGO THAT I THE.

00:35:20.552 --> 00:35:24.456 region:rollup2
WE HAD SIGNIFICANT DOWNTURN IN

00:35:22.787 --> 00:35:26.157 region:rollup2
THE ECONOMY WE HAD A REDUCTION

00:35:24.456 --> 00:35:27.225 region:rollup2
OR AN A CONTRACTION OF THE

00:35:26.157 --> 00:35:29.594 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE BECAUSE.

00:35:27.225 --> 00:35:31.930 region:rollup2
WE WERE FILLING VACANCIES AND

00:35:29.594 --> 00:35:34.132 region:rollup2
SO WE HAD A LOT OF BACON STATE

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:35.767 region:rollup2
SPACE ARE WERE TO PUT IT MORE

00:35:34.132 --> 00:35:38.303 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY WEEK WE HAD A LOT

00:35:35.767 --> 00:35:39.270 region:rollup2
OF VACANCIES IN STATE OWNED

00:35:38.303 --> 00:35:39.871 region:rollup2
BUILDINGS AND SO WE WERE TRYING

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:41.673 region:rollup2
TO GET.

00:35:39.871 --> 00:35:43.575 region:rollup2
THAT DEPARTMENTS ADDED MOVED

00:35:41.673 --> 00:35:45.477 region:rollup2
OUT INTO OUR PRIVATE RENTAL

00:35:43.575 --> 00:35:47.679 region:rollup2
SPACE BACK INTO THE BUILDINGS.

00:35:45.477 --> 00:35:49.347 region:rollup2
BUT THERE WERE ISSUES WITH.

00:35:47.679 --> 00:35:51.049 region:rollup2
ADA COMPLIANCE AND ALL THAT

00:35:49.347 --> 00:35:53.151 region:rollup2
KIND STEP IN SO THERE WAS THIS

00:35:51.049 --> 00:35:56.121 region:rollup2
THIS CHALLENGE BETWEEN.

00:35:53.151 --> 00:35:58.657 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE UTILIZE?

00:35:56.121 --> 00:36:01.192 region:rollup2
OUR OUR SPACE WELL SO SO NUMBER

00:35:58.657 --> 00:36:02.660 region:rollup2
ONE IS THE STATE DID NOT DO A

00:36:01.192 --> 00:36:04.262 region:rollup2
VERY GOOD JOB OF.

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:06.331 region:rollup2
AT KEEPING UP WITH ME IN ITS

00:36:04.262 --> 00:36:08.366 region:rollup2
AND THAT I THINK YOU FIND THAT

00:36:06.331 --> 00:36:09.501 region:rollup2
OVERALL IS THE CASE IN IN

00:36:08.366 --> 00:36:10.769 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT IS THAT WHEN TIMES

00:36:09.501 --> 00:36:13.104 region:rollup2
GET TOUGH.

00:36:10.769 --> 00:36:14.973 region:rollup2
WE TRY TO KEEP. EXISTING

00:36:13.104 --> 00:36:16.841 region:rollup2
SERVICES GOING AND SO WE. WE

00:36:14.973 --> 00:36:19.611 region:rollup2
DELETE THAT MAINTENANCE.

00:36:16.841 --> 00:36:21.780 region:rollup2
AND AND SO THEN WHEN WE FINALLY

00:36:19.611 --> 00:36:23.348 region:rollup2
DO TURN THE ECONOMY AROUND WE

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:25.517 region:rollup2
START TO TRY TO FIX THE MAIN AND

00:36:23.348 --> 00:36:27.018 region:rollup2
SENATE'S COST US A LOT MORE IT'S

00:36:25.517 --> 00:36:27.385 region:rollup2
NOT VERY COST EFFECTIVE AND SO.

00:36:27.018 --> 00:36:30.088 region:rollup2
SO.

00:36:27.385 --> 00:36:32.724 region:rollup2
THERE THAT THAT QUESTION BECAME

00:36:30.088 --> 00:36:33.191 region:rollup2
DO WE UPGRADE THE STATE SPACE

00:36:32.724 --> 00:36:34.993 region:rollup2
AND.

00:36:33.191 --> 00:36:36.728 region:rollup2
HAVE STATE DEPARTMENT STAY IN

00:36:34.993 --> 00:36:39.998 region:rollup2
THAT SPACE OR DO WE.

00:36:36.728 --> 00:36:41.533 region:rollup2
CELL. AND LET SOMEONE ELSE

00:36:39.998 --> 00:36:42.867 region:rollup2
WORRY ABOUT THAT UPKEEP AND

00:36:41.533 --> 00:36:44.769 region:rollup2
MAINTENANCE AND.

00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:46.838 region:rollup2
WE RENT AND SO I AM TRYING TO

00:36:44.769 --> 00:36:48.239 region:rollup2
GET A SENSE OF OF WHERE WE'RE

00:36:46.838 --> 00:36:50.942 region:rollup2
GOING AS I LOOK AT THIS

00:36:48.239 --> 00:36:53.211 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR ON REQUEST BECAUSE.

00:36:50.942 --> 00:36:53.378 region:rollup2
THE RENOVATIONS ARE EXPENSIVE

00:36:53.211 --> 00:36:53.778 region:rollup2
AND.

00:36:53.378 --> 00:36:55.313 region:rollup2
.

00:36:53.778 --> 00:36:56.581 region:rollup2
YEAH BUT BUT THEY'RE REALLY

00:36:55.313 --> 00:36:58.316 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT STATE BUILDINGS AND

00:36:56.581 --> 00:36:59.150 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WE ALL AGREE WE

00:36:58.316 --> 00:37:01.219 region:rollup2
SHOULD KEEP THEM.

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:03.288 region:rollup2
IT AND I THINK THE SEQUENCING

00:37:01.219 --> 00:37:04.956 region:rollup2
IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS

00:37:03.288 --> 00:37:06.458 region:rollup2
YOU VACATE. THE BUILDING YOU

00:37:04.956 --> 00:37:06.891 region:rollup2
GOTTA PUT PEOPLE SOMEPLACE AND

00:37:06.458 --> 00:37:09.127 region:rollup2
THEN.

00:37:06.891 --> 00:37:10.128 region:rollup2
HAVE HAVE THEM CLOSE ENOUGH SO

00:37:09.127 --> 00:37:11.029 region:rollup2
THAT YOU CAN THEN BRING THEM

00:37:10.128 --> 00:37:12.797 region:rollup2
BACK WITHOUT IT BEING AT THE

00:37:11.029 --> 00:37:14.365 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE AND SO I WAS TRYING TO

00:37:12.797 --> 00:37:16.434 region:rollup2
GET A SENSE OF.

00:37:14.365 --> 00:37:17.769 region:rollup2
OF WHAT THE THE SEQUENCE WAS

00:37:16.434 --> 00:37:17.936 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE AROUND THE STATE AND

00:37:17.769 --> 00:37:19.270 region:rollup2
THE.

00:37:17.936 --> 00:37:21.239 region:rollup2
.

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:23.341 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THEIR PRINTING PLANT

00:37:21.239 --> 00:37:24.609 region:rollup2
LOCATION SITES SEEM TO BE PRETTY

00:37:23.341 --> 00:37:26.978 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO THAT WHOLE

00:37:24.609 --> 00:37:29.814 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION IN AND OUT. BUT.

00:37:26.978 --> 00:37:32.617 region:rollup2
BUT IT DIDN'T HAVE A.

00:37:29.814 --> 00:37:33.151 region:rollup2
THAT THEIR REQUEST

00:37:32.617 --> 00:37:35.453 region:rollup2
WAS FOR.

00:37:33.151 --> 00:37:36.521 region:rollup2
WORKING DRAWINGS AND I ASSUME

00:37:35.453 --> 00:37:37.989 region:rollup2
THAT WAS IN PREPARATION OF THE

00:37:36.521 --> 00:37:40.158 region:rollup2
BID PROCESS.

00:37:37.989 --> 00:37:42.494 region:rollup2
BUT IT WASN'T REALLY CLEAR TO

00:37:40.158 --> 00:37:43.762 region:rollup2
ME IF THAT IS BECAUSE THE OTHER

00:37:42.494 --> 00:37:45.063 region:rollup2
ONES TALK ABOUT DESIGN BUILD

00:37:43.762 --> 00:37:46.798 region:rollup2
KNOWS THAT THE PREFERRED

00:37:45.063 --> 00:37:48.600 region:rollup2
STRATEGY AND SO IF IT IF YOU

00:37:46.798 --> 00:37:50.168 region:rollup2
COULD JUST I'M NOT. I'M NOT SURE

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.836 region:rollup2
I'VE GOT A SPECIFIC QUESTION

00:37:50.168 --> 00:37:52.470 region:rollup2
OTHER THAN I'M REALLY STRUGGLING

00:37:51.836 --> 00:37:54.472 region:rollup2
WITH TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:55.573 region:rollup2
THESE ALL WORK TOGETHER AND THE

00:37:54.472 --> 00:37:56.274 region:rollup2
COSTS

00:37:55.573 --> 00:37:58.676 region:rollup2
FOR?

00:37:56.274 --> 00:38:00.812 region:rollup2
RENOVATION DO SEEM VERY HIGH

00:37:58.676 --> 00:38:02.280 region:rollup2
GIVEN THAT THE COURTS WAS WITH

00:38:00.812 --> 00:38:04.649 region:rollup2
IT WAS X. A MEAN THAT REALLY IS

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:06.050 region:rollup2
A A PRIMO CHAPEL OF OF DOING THE

00:38:04.649 --> 00:38:07.385 region:rollup2
HIGHEST QUALITY I THINK. A

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:08.653 region:rollup2
RENOVATION THAT YOU CAN GET I

00:38:07.385 --> 00:38:09.587 region:rollup2
THINK IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL

00:38:08.653 --> 00:38:12.190 region:rollup2
COMPARED TO WHEN IT LOOKED LIKE

00:38:09.587 --> 00:38:13.725 region:rollup2
BEFORE. ON SO COULD IF YOU COULD

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:15.860 region:rollup2
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THEM

00:38:13.725 --> 00:38:17.529 region:rollup2
SEQUENCING WAITRESS THOUGHT IS.

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:18.630 region:rollup2
FROM THE ADMINISTRATION

00:38:17.529 --> 00:38:21.332 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE ON.

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:23.001 region:rollup2
UPGRADING OUR OUR ON.

00:38:21.332 --> 00:38:24.302 region:rollup2
OUR OWN EXISTING BUILDINGS AND

00:38:23.001 --> 00:38:26.171 region:rollup2
UTILIZE A MINUTE ASSUMING WHAT

00:38:24.302 --> 00:38:28.573 region:rollup2
WERE THEIR GOAL IS TO UTILIZE

00:38:26.171 --> 00:38:30.475 region:rollup2
OUR OWN. UP RESOURCES AND NOT

00:38:28.573 --> 00:38:32.043 region:rollup2
HAVE TO RENT OUTSIDE OF THE

00:38:30.475 --> 00:38:33.578 region:rollup2
STATE BUT PRINT UNLESS WE REALLY

00:38:32.043 --> 00:38:35.380 region:rollup2
HAVE TO SO I GUESS THAT'S A. ONE

00:38:33.578 --> 00:38:36.748 region:rollup2
OF THE QUESTIONS SURE THAT'S A

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:39.317 region:rollup2
THAT'S A LOTTA TO BITE OFF I

00:38:36.748 --> 00:38:42.587 region:rollup2
WILL TRY TO BE AND CONCISE.

00:38:39.317 --> 00:38:43.154 region:rollup2
ALSO ULTIMATELY YEAH WE WE HAVE

00:38:42.587 --> 00:38:45.456 region:rollup2
DOING IN TWENTY FIFTEEN IS

00:38:43.154 --> 00:38:47.091 region:rollup2
HAVING A LOOK AT ALL THE DEVIOUS

00:38:45.456 --> 00:38:48.326 region:rollup2
OWNED OFFICE BUILDINGS IN THE

00:38:47.091 --> 00:38:49.761 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO AREA FOLLOWED BY THE

00:38:48.326 --> 00:38:51.396 region:rollup2
REST OF THAT THE STATE.

00:38:49.761 --> 00:38:53.064 region:rollup2
THOSE BUILDINGS WERE THEN

00:38:51.396 --> 00:38:54.866 region:rollup2
RANKED IN TERMS OF.

00:38:53.064 --> 00:38:55.667 region:rollup2
THE SEVERITY OF THE

00:38:54.866 --> 00:38:57.435 region:rollup2
DEFICIENCIES.

00:38:55.667 --> 00:38:58.770 region:rollup2
WE THEN DEVELOPED A SEQUENCING

00:38:57.435 --> 00:39:01.706 region:rollup2
PLAN PRINCIPLES THAT.

00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:03.074 region:rollup2
SO WE WERE LOOKING AT NOT JUST

00:39:01.706 --> 00:39:05.243 region:rollup2
WHICH BUILDINGS ARE WERE THE

00:39:03.074 --> 00:39:06.578 region:rollup2
MOST IN NEED OF SPACE BUT IF

00:39:05.243 --> 00:39:07.712 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO RENOVATE ONE

00:39:06.578 --> 00:39:09.113 region:rollup2
KNOWING THAT THERE'S REALLY NOT

00:39:07.712 --> 00:39:10.248 region:rollup2
ANY LEASABLE SPACE IN SACRAMENTO

00:39:09.113 --> 00:39:12.183 region:rollup2
OF ANY SIGNIFICANCE.

00:39:10.248 --> 00:39:12.951 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BUILD A NEW

00:39:12.183 --> 00:39:14.686 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

00:39:12.951 --> 00:39:16.020 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION OF THAT YOUR POINT

00:39:14.686 --> 00:39:18.189 region:rollup2
ABOUT SORT OF THE THE THE

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:18.356 region:rollup2
EXPANDING CONTRACTING NATURE OF

00:39:18.189 --> 00:39:19.924 region:rollup2
OF.

00:39:18.356 --> 00:39:21.559 region:rollup2
THE STATE WORKFORCE ON A LONG

00:39:19.924 --> 00:39:22.393 region:rollup2
ENOUGH TIMELINE IT TENDS TO

00:39:21.559 --> 00:39:23.661 region:rollup2
KEEPING PACE WITH POPULATION

00:39:22.393 --> 00:39:25.597 region:rollup2
GROWTH.

00:39:23.661 --> 00:39:27.031 region:rollup2
AND SO WHAT WE SEE OVER TIME IS

00:39:25.597 --> 00:39:27.999 region:rollup2
THE NEED FOR EVER INCREASING

00:39:27.031 --> 00:39:29.334 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL OFFICE SPACE AND YOU

00:39:27.999 --> 00:39:30.802 region:rollup2
SEE THAT I THINK EVEN WITH PHIL

00:39:29.334 --> 00:39:32.370 region:rollup2
LEGALIZATION OF CANNABIS.

00:39:30.802 --> 00:39:33.838 region:rollup2
THAT SPURRED ADDITIONAL SPACE

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:35.306 region:rollup2
REQUESTS INTO THE GOVERNMENT

00:39:33.838 --> 00:39:36.908 region:rollup2
TENDS TO DO THAT.

00:39:35.306 --> 00:39:38.743 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS DO WILL NEED

00:39:36.908 --> 00:39:39.510 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL SPACE AS WELL AS THE

00:39:38.743 --> 00:39:41.079 region:rollup2
FACT THAT WE'RE ESSENTIALLY

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:41.713 region:rollup2
LANDLOCKED IN SACRAMENTO TO

00:39:41.079 --> 00:39:43.915 region:rollup2
BEGIN WITH IT.

00:39:41.713 --> 00:39:45.717 region:rollup2
INITIATED US INTO BUILDING THE

00:39:43.915 --> 00:39:46.718 region:rollup2
NEW NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY

00:39:45.717 --> 00:39:48.419 region:rollup2
BUILDING IN THE TWIN TURBO THREE

00:39:46.718 --> 00:39:48.953 region:rollup2
BILLION WHICH IS AUTHORIZED AND

00:39:48.419 --> 00:39:50.154 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIXTEEN.

00:39:48.953 --> 00:39:52.257 region:rollup2
THOSE TWO PROJECTS AS THEY ARE

00:39:50.154 --> 00:39:53.892 region:rollup2
BUILT THEN ALLOW US TO MOVE

00:39:52.257 --> 00:39:55.526 region:rollup2
TENANTS FROM DEFICIENT SPACE

00:39:53.892 --> 00:39:57.562 region:rollup2
INTO NEW SPACE.

00:39:55.526 --> 00:39:58.896 region:rollup2
WE ARE AGAIN COME LOOKING AT

00:39:57.562 --> 00:40:00.965 region:rollup2
THE LARGEST SPACE.

00:39:58.896 --> 00:40:02.734 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS WHAT KIND OF

00:40:00.965 --> 00:40:04.669 region:rollup2
OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES WE CAN

00:40:02.734 --> 00:40:06.604 region:rollup2
GAIN A THROUGH THE PROCESS SO.

00:40:04.669 --> 00:40:07.438 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW THE NATURAL RESOURCES

00:40:06.604 --> 00:40:09.274 region:rollup2
AGENCY HAS.

00:40:07.438 --> 00:40:10.108 region:rollup2
TO GET A TOTAL OF SEVEN

00:40:09.274 --> 00:40:11.376 region:rollup2
APARTMENTS PLUS THE AGENCY

00:40:10.108 --> 00:40:13.011 region:rollup2
ITSELF A BIG ON THE NATURAL

00:40:11.376 --> 00:40:14.112 region:rollup2
RESOURCES NEW DATA RESOURCES

00:40:13.011 --> 00:40:16.047 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

00:40:14.112 --> 00:40:16.581 region:rollup2
THAT ALLOWS THEM TO CONSOLIDATE

00:40:16.047 --> 00:40:18.716 region:rollup2
THE WAY THEY HAD BEEN ABLE

00:40:16.581 --> 00:40:20.184 region:rollup2
CONSULTANT BEFORE. ON THE

00:40:18.716 --> 00:40:21.019 region:rollup2
PROFITING ULTRA BUILDING WILL

00:40:20.184 --> 00:40:22.620 region:rollup2
TAKE THE TENANTS IN THE BATES

00:40:21.019 --> 00:40:23.354 region:rollup2
AND BUILDING AND AND PUT THEM IN

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:24.756 region:rollup2
NEW SPACE ALLOWING US TO

00:40:23.354 --> 00:40:27.292 region:rollup2
RENOVATE THE BATES AND.

00:40:24.756 --> 00:40:28.693 region:rollup2
SO IT THIS SEQUENCING PLAN

00:40:27.292 --> 00:40:31.095 region:rollup2
ALLOWS US TO CREATE SPACE MOVE

00:40:28.693 --> 00:40:31.496 region:rollup2
PEOPLE INTO THOSE SPACES AND THE

00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:33.531 region:rollup2
RENOVATE BEHIND.

00:40:31.496 --> 00:40:34.999 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY ARE.

00:40:33.531 --> 00:40:38.102 region:rollup2
TICKETING PLAN PRINCIPLES.

00:40:34.999 --> 00:40:40.004 region:rollup2
DO PREFER TO OWN IN AREAS OF OF.

00:40:38.102 --> 00:40:41.139 region:rollup2
HI LISA ABOUT THAT HIGHWAYS

00:40:40.004 --> 00:40:42.440 region:rollup2
COSTS AND RIGHT NOW IN

00:40:41.139 --> 00:40:44.542 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO IS PRICKLY THE

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:46.377 region:rollup2
DOWNTOWN CORE IT IS. VERY

00:40:44.542 --> 00:40:48.079 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE TO LEASE SPACE.

00:40:46.377 --> 00:40:49.514 region:rollup2
SO THE THE GOAL IS OLD LIVING

00:40:48.079 --> 00:40:51.616 region:rollup2
FROM INTEREST IN PERSPECTIVE TO.

00:40:49.514 --> 00:40:53.217 region:rollup2
CONTINUE THIS.

00:40:51.616 --> 00:40:54.319 region:rollup2
PROCESS OF UPDATING ARE

00:40:53.217 --> 00:40:55.954 region:rollup2
DEFICIENT SPACE

00:40:54.319 --> 00:40:57.555 region:rollup2
I'M RICHARDS BOULEVARDS USE YOUR

00:40:55.954 --> 00:40:59.424 region:rollup2
POINT ABOUT THE WORKING DRAWINGS

00:40:57.555 --> 00:41:00.892 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE THE STATE.

00:40:59.424 --> 00:41:02.660 region:rollup2
PRINT PLANT THAT'S ON THAT SITE.

00:41:00.892 --> 00:41:03.861 region:rollup2
THE WORKING DRAWINGS REQUEST IS

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:05.530 region:rollup2
RELATED TO THE DEMOLITION OF

00:41:03.861 --> 00:41:07.398 region:rollup2
THAT PROJECT ONCE WE DEMOLISH

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:08.466 region:rollup2
THAT PROJECT IT AVOIDS HAVING TO

00:41:07.398 --> 00:41:10.234 region:rollup2
PAY ONE SHUT DOWN BECAUSE IT

00:41:08.466 --> 00:41:11.502 region:rollup2
ALLOWS US TO CHEAT UP FOR

00:41:10.234 --> 00:41:13.004 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT OR TALENT OR

00:41:11.502 --> 00:41:15.139 region:rollup2
WHATEVER ELSE HAPPENS. HOWEVER

00:41:13.004 --> 00:41:16.908 region:rollup2
OUR PLANET PRESENT IS TO WITH

00:41:15.139 --> 00:41:19.277 region:rollup2
RICHARD BELOW PROJECT TO BUILD A

00:41:16.908 --> 00:41:21.045 region:rollup2
NEW CAMPUS COMPLEX ON THAT SITE.

00:41:19.277 --> 00:41:22.113 region:rollup2
DOING THAT WILL ALLOW US TO

00:41:21.045 --> 00:41:23.181 region:rollup2
RENOVATE FOR FIFTY AND STREET

00:41:22.113 --> 00:41:24.315 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THE BILL.

00:41:23.181 --> 00:41:26.250 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

00:41:24.315 --> 00:41:27.585 region:rollup2
AND THEN ALLOW TO CONSOLIDATE

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:29.587 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS

00:41:27.585 --> 00:41:31.522 region:rollup2
AGENCY INTO THAT NOT BUILDING.

00:41:29.587 --> 00:41:33.257 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE THIS THAT THE TENURE

00:41:31.522 --> 00:41:33.891 region:rollup2
SEQUENCING PLAN IS A YOU KNOW

00:41:33.257 --> 00:41:35.760 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE COULD OUR

00:41:33.891 --> 00:41:37.729 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE PRIORITIZES.

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:39.397 region:rollup2
RENOVATION NEW CONSTRUCTION TO

00:41:37.729 --> 00:41:40.098 region:rollup2
ENABLE US TO RENOVATIONS IN THE

00:41:39.397 --> 00:41:42.500 region:rollup2
FIRST PLACE.

00:41:40.098 --> 00:41:43.868 region:rollup2
IF WE WERE TO TAKE SAY THE.

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:45.103 region:rollup2
THE THE THREE HUNDRED AND I

00:41:43.868 --> 00:41:46.070 region:rollup2
ALSO HAVE THOUSAND SQUARE FEET

00:41:45.103 --> 00:41:47.372 region:rollup2
THAT'S IN THE BATES AND BUILDING

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:48.906 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOT THAT KIND SPACE IN

00:41:47.372 --> 00:41:49.907 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO WOULD BE DIVIDED THE

00:41:48.906 --> 00:41:51.042 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT UP INTO FIVE OR SIX

00:41:49.907 --> 00:41:52.243 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT LEASES THROUGHOUT THE

00:41:51.042 --> 00:41:53.911 region:rollup2
GREATER SACRAMENTO AREA.

00:41:52.243 --> 00:41:55.179 region:rollup2
SO WEAK INCOME HOW TO BE SINGLE

00:41:53.911 --> 00:41:57.048 region:rollup2
IT'S THE WAY IT IS.

00:41:55.179 --> 00:41:58.549 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE LOOKED AT A NUMBER OF

00:41:57.048 --> 00:42:00.585 region:rollup2
VARIABLES YOU HAVE THE. THE

00:41:58.549 --> 00:42:01.886 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULES YOU HAVE

00:42:00.585 --> 00:42:03.287 region:rollup2
THE.

00:42:01.886 --> 00:42:04.355 region:rollup2
EXISTING SQUARE FOOTAGE IN

00:42:03.287 --> 00:42:05.723 region:rollup2
BUILDINGS YOU HAVE.

00:42:04.355 --> 00:42:07.458 region:rollup2
THAT THE LEASE SPACE IN

00:42:05.723 --> 00:42:08.726 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO WHEN LEASES EXPIRE

00:42:07.458 --> 00:42:10.261 region:rollup2
WHO MY CONSOLIDATORS UP THERE'S

00:42:08.726 --> 00:42:11.829 region:rollup2
A DOZEN OR SO VARIABLES THAT

00:42:10.261 --> 00:42:12.430 region:rollup2
WE'VE LOOKED AT THE KIND OF

00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:13.798 region:rollup2
CRAFT THE PLANE AT THE END OF

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:15.066 region:rollup2
THE DAY.

00:42:13.798 --> 00:42:17.602 region:rollup2
AND YOUR QUESTION THAT LISA HIGH

00:42:15.066 --> 00:42:19.037 region:rollup2
LEVEL YES I THINK THAT I GUESS

00:42:17.602 --> 00:42:20.571 region:rollup2
THAT THE PRINCIPLES AYE AND

00:42:19.037 --> 00:42:22.607 region:rollup2
MONEY HERE IS ONE THAT THAT WE

00:42:20.571 --> 00:42:23.708 region:rollup2
THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:42:22.607 --> 00:42:25.376 region:rollup2
HAVE ARTS OUR OWN.

00:42:23.708 --> 00:42:26.944 region:rollup2
STATE OWNS YES THAT ARE

00:42:25.376 --> 00:42:29.113 region:rollup2

00:45:03.734 --> 00:45:06.337 region:rollup2
I SO WE RECOMMEND THAT THE

00:45:06.337 --> 00:45:09.340 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL USING OTHER FUNDING

00:45:07.905 --> 00:45:10.408 region:rollup2
SOURCES FOR THIS PROPOSAL

00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:12.343 region:rollup2
INCLUDING POTENTIALLY THE

00:45:10.408 --> 00:45:14.178 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FIND OR

00:45:12.343 --> 00:45:16.047 region:rollup2
THEY'LL TURN EVAN RENEWABLE FUEL

00:45:14.178 --> 00:45:17.882 region:rollup2
AND VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY FUNDS.

00:45:16.047 --> 00:45:19.984 region:rollup2
I'M IN ORDER TO.

00:45:17.882 --> 00:45:20.985 region:rollup2
FACILITATE THE LEGISLATURE'S

00:45:19.984 --> 00:45:22.286 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION OF THOSE FUNDING

00:45:20.985 --> 00:45:23.621 region:rollup2
SOURCES RECOMMEND THAT THE

00:45:22.286 --> 00:45:25.289 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE DIRECT

00:45:23.621 --> 00:45:27.458 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION AND TO REPORT ON.

00:45:25.289 --> 00:45:28.793 region:rollup2
Y.. WHY DIDN'T USE THOSE

00:45:27.458 --> 00:45:29.994 region:rollup2
SOURCES AND WHETHER THOSE

00:45:28.793 --> 00:45:31.395 region:rollup2
SOURCES MIGHT BE AVAILABLE?

00:45:29.994 --> 00:45:32.863 region:rollup2
WE WOULD KNOW THAT THEIR COUPLE

00:45:31.395 --> 00:45:33.664 region:rollup2
REASONS FOR THIS RECOMMENDATION

00:45:32.863 --> 00:45:35.399 region:rollup2
FIRST.

00:45:33.664 --> 00:45:37.101 region:rollup2
SO THIS PROPOSAL THIS IS THE

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:38.302 region:rollup2
SECOND YEAR WE'VE HAD FUNDING

00:45:37.101 --> 00:45:39.904 region:rollup2
FOR BASICALLY THIS.

00:45:38.302 --> 00:45:41.906 region:rollup2
GENERAL PURPOSE IN LAST COUPLE

00:45:39.904 --> 00:45:43.107 region:rollup2
OF YEARS AND ALSO.

00:45:41.906 --> 00:45:44.442 region:rollup2
WE EXPECT THAT THEY'LL BE

00:45:43.107 --> 00:45:46.811 region:rollup2
FUTURE PROPOSALS.

00:45:44.442 --> 00:45:47.712 region:rollup2
IN THIS AREA BECAUSE THAT GOALS

00:45:46.811 --> 00:45:49.380 region:rollup2
ARE REALLY.

00:45:47.712 --> 00:45:50.815 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN

00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:53.217 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA REACH THIS YEAR IN

00:45:50.815 --> 00:45:54.852 region:rollup2
TERMS OF BOTH WE. A SEVEN

00:45:53.217 --> 00:45:57.922 region:rollup2
PRODUCTION AS WELL AS WORKPLACE

00:45:54.852 --> 00:45:58.356 region:rollup2
STATIONS FOR OR I STAFF THAT

00:45:57.922 --> 00:45:59.557 region:rollup2
WORK FOR THE STATE.

00:45:58.356 --> 00:46:00.925 region:rollup2
SO IN TOTAL WE EXPECT THAT THE

00:45:59.557 --> 00:46:02.126 region:rollup2
COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH BUILDING

00:46:00.925 --> 00:46:03.661 region:rollup2
THIS INFRASTRUCTURE WOULD.

00:46:02.126 --> 00:46:04.695 region:rollup2
LIKELY EXCEED A HUNDRED MILLION

00:46:03.661 --> 00:46:06.163 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

00:46:04.695 --> 00:46:07.431 region:rollup2
OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS SO

00:46:06.163 --> 00:46:08.733 region:rollup2
THERE'S SUBSTANTIAL COSTS.

00:46:07.431 --> 00:46:10.234 region:rollup2
WE WOULD KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR

00:46:08.733 --> 00:46:12.303 region:rollup2
HAS PROPOSED OTHER FUNDING

00:46:10.234 --> 00:46:13.804 region:rollup2
SOURCES FOR SEVEN PRODUCTION OR

00:46:12.303 --> 00:46:14.505 region:rollup2
IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR. OTHER

00:46:13.804 --> 00:46:16.374 region:rollup2
GOVERNORS KEVIN TRADE

00:46:14.505 --> 00:46:17.942 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURE PLAN ALLOCATES ONE

00:46:16.374 --> 00:46:20.444 region:rollup2
POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN

00:46:17.942 --> 00:46:21.812 region:rollup2
DISCRETIONARY AND YOUR F.

00:46:20.444 --> 00:46:22.880 region:rollup2
REVENUE.

00:46:21.812 --> 00:46:24.215 region:rollup2
HOWEVER VERY SICK ACTIVITIES

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:24.715 region:rollup2
INCLUDING INCENTIVIZING THE

00:46:24.215 --> 00:46:26.684 region:rollup2
PRIVATE PURCHASE OF ZEV

00:46:24.715 --> 00:46:27.985 region:rollup2
VEHICLES.

00:46:26.684 --> 00:46:29.287 region:rollup2
AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE

00:46:27.985 --> 00:46:30.755 region:rollup2
SPENDING PLAN INCLUDES TWO

00:46:29.287 --> 00:46:32.256 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION

00:46:30.755 --> 00:46:32.857 region:rollup2
FROM THE OTHER FUND THEY MENTION

00:46:32.256 --> 00:46:34.458 region:rollup2
THE ALTERNATIVE AND RENEWABLE

00:46:32.857 --> 00:46:35.893 region:rollup2
FUEL. AND VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY

00:46:34.458 --> 00:46:38.629 region:rollup2
FUND AS WELL AS A FEW OTHER

00:46:35.893 --> 00:46:39.597 region:rollup2
FUNDS ARE TO SUPPORT PRIVATE AYE

00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:40.598 region:rollup2
CHARGING STATIONS SO WE THINK

00:46:39.597 --> 00:46:42.733 region:rollup2
IT'S WORTH CONSIDERING THIS

00:46:40.598 --> 00:46:43.601 region:rollup2
FUNDING SOURCES FOR THESE PUBLIC

00:46:42.733 --> 00:46:44.335 region:rollup2
STATIONS AS WELL.

00:46:43.601 --> 00:46:45.736 region:rollup2
I WE WOULD KNOW THE

00:46:44.335 --> 00:46:46.270 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION DOES HAVE SOME

00:46:45.736 --> 00:46:47.238 region:rollup2
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:48.673 region:rollup2
WOULD.

00:46:47.238 --> 00:46:50.307 region:rollup2
DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE

00:46:48.673 --> 00:46:51.842 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT TO TRY TO SEEK OTHER

00:46:50.307 --> 00:46:54.045 region:rollup2
FUNDING SOURCES BUT THE SPAWNING

00:46:51.842 --> 00:46:54.945 region:rollup2
SOURCES THAT WE. ARE MENTIONED

00:46:54.045 --> 00:46:56.914 region:rollup2
THERE WOULD ONLY BE AVAILABLE

00:46:54.945 --> 00:46:57.848 region:rollup2
LIKELY THE LEGISLATURE MADE A

00:46:56.914 --> 00:46:59.450 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC APPROPRIATION WITHIN

00:46:57.848 --> 00:47:02.586 region:rollup2

BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:47:12.663 --> 00:47:16.867 region:rollup2
THE ELECTRIC VEHICLES.

00:47:14.598 --> 00:47:19.070 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE PLAN.

00:47:16.867 --> 00:47:20.404 region:rollup2
I'M WELL THE STEPS ARE TO FIRST

00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:21.706 region:rollup2
OF ALL TO GO OUT TO THE ACTUAL

00:47:21.706 --> 00:47:25.943 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE THE

00:47:23.274 --> 00:47:27.978 region:rollup2
VIABILITY OF PLACEMENT BASED ON.

00:47:25.943 --> 00:47:30.381 region:rollup2
A LOCATION BASED ON COST OF

00:47:27.978 --> 00:47:32.116 region:rollup2
TRENCHING DISTANCE TO THE

00:47:32.116 --> 00:47:35.619 region:rollup2
WE DO AN ASSESSMENT. THEN WE CAN

00:47:34.051 --> 00:47:37.521 region:rollup2
DETERMINE HOW MANY WE CAN

00:47:35.619 --> 00:47:39.356 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAVE EACH SITE. BUT THE

00:47:37.521 --> 00:47:41.225 region:rollup2
PLAN IS TO FOCUS ON THE FLEET

00:47:39.356 --> 00:47:42.393 region:rollup2
FIRST SO WE HAVE A NUMBER OF

00:47:41.225 --> 00:47:43.794 region:rollup2
FLEET VEHICLES THAT AT THIS

00:47:42.393 --> 00:47:45.396 region:rollup2
POINT.

00:47:43.794 --> 00:47:47.598 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE A

00:47:45.396 --> 00:47:49.700 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR CHARGING AND

00:47:47.598 --> 00:47:51.268 region:rollup2
SO OUR PRIORITY IS TO PRIORITIZE

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:53.137 region:rollup2
THOSE FIRST AND THEN OBVIOUSLY

00:47:51.268 --> 00:47:54.538 region:rollup2
THE WORKPLACE CHARGING THAT IS

00:47:53.137 --> 00:47:56.807 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE FACILITIES

00:47:54.538 --> 00:47:58.275 region:rollup2
WOULD ALSO BE. TAKEN CARE OF AT

00:47:56.807 --> 00:47:59.844 region:rollup2
THE SAME TIME FOR ECONOMIC

00:47:58.275 --> 00:48:00.244 region:rollup2
REASONS WILL EVERY STATE

00:47:59.844 --> 00:48:01.479 region:rollup2
BUILDING GET THIS

00:48:00.244 --> 00:48:03.047 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:48:01.479 --> 00:48:04.815 region:rollup2
NOT NECESSARILY SO AGAIN AT

00:48:03.047 --> 00:48:06.617 region:rollup2
FIRST IT WILL BE FLEET AS A

00:48:04.815 --> 00:48:08.819 region:rollup2
PRIORITY AND NOT EVERY EVERY

00:48:06.617 --> 00:48:10.020 region:rollup2
STATE AGENCY OR DEPARTMENT HAS

00:48:08.819 --> 00:48:11.722 region:rollup2
FLEET ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:13.657 region:rollup2
FACILITIES OF THOSE WOULD BE THE

00:48:11.722 --> 00:48:15.659 region:rollup2
FIRST PRIORITY. ON SECOND

00:48:13.657 --> 00:48:17.928 region:rollup2
PRIORITY WILL BE WHERE THERE IS

00:48:15.659 --> 00:48:19.830 region:rollup2
A NEED FOR WORKPLACE CHARGING SO

00:48:17.928 --> 00:48:22.166 region:rollup2
AGAIN WITH THEIRS ONE OR TWO

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:23.667 region:rollup2
PARKING SPOTS IS TYPICALLY WOULD

00:48:22.166 --> 00:48:25.636 region:rollup2
NOT BE ECONOMICAL TO GRASP IT OF

00:48:23.667 --> 00:48:27.471 region:rollup2
ITS A LARGE FACILITY WITH A LOT

00:48:25.636 --> 00:48:29.240 region:rollup2
OF WORKPLACE NEEDS THAN THOSE

00:48:27.471 --> 00:48:31.008 region:rollup2
WOULD BE A PRIORITY. AS A SECOND

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:33.210 region:rollup2
PRIORITY AND WHAT IS PROJECTED

00:48:31.008 --> 00:48:34.645 region:rollup2
COST TO SUPPORT ESCALATION OF

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:36.480 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL FACILITIES.

00:48:34.645 --> 00:48:38.516 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE STILL WERE WERE NAY

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:40.317 region:rollup2
ALL IN OUR SECOND YEAR HONOR

00:48:38.516 --> 00:48:41.919 region:rollup2
SORRY FIRST YEAR THIS IS THIS

00:48:40.317 --> 00:48:44.021 region:rollup2
REQUEST IS FOR THE SECOND YEARS

00:48:41.919 --> 00:48:46.457 region:rollup2
SO. WE'RE STILL YEAH I GETTING

00:48:44.021 --> 00:48:47.558 region:rollup2
STABLE AS FAR AS ACTUAL COSTS

00:48:46.457 --> 00:48:49.860 region:rollup2
BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S COSTING

00:48:47.558 --> 00:48:51.028 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY TWENTY THOUSAND

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:53.164 region:rollup2
DOLLARS PER CHARGING.

00:48:51.028 --> 00:48:55.199 region:rollup2
SPOT TO INSTALL AND THAT

00:48:53.164 --> 00:48:58.769 region:rollup2
INCLUDES ALL OF THE DESIGN AS

00:48:55.199 --> 00:49:01.806 region:rollup2
WELL AS THE INSTALLATION.

00:48:58.769 --> 00:49:02.773 region:rollup2
A QUESTIONS FROM THE.

00:49:01.806 --> 00:49:04.208 region:rollup2
QUESTION BUT IT WAS GOV HERE

00:49:02.773 --> 00:49:06.210 region:rollup2
YEAH I JUST GOT TO SAY THAT

00:49:04.208 --> 00:49:08.245 region:rollup2
TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT.

00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:10.281 region:rollup2
IBM.

00:49:08.245 --> 00:49:12.082 region:rollup2
THE CHARGING STATION ISLAM IS

00:49:10.281 --> 00:49:13.751 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU.

00:49:12.082 --> 00:49:15.452 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU START FIGURING IT INTO

00:49:13.751 --> 00:49:17.188 region:rollup2
THE PRICE A VEHICLE THAT THAT'S.

00:49:15.452 --> 00:49:18.289 region:rollup2
IT JUST IT'S VERY HIGH BUT BUT

00:49:17.188 --> 00:49:20.257 region:rollup2
MY QUESTION.

00:49:18.289 --> 00:49:21.826 region:rollup2
IS.

00:49:20.257 --> 00:49:23.794 region:rollup2
AS I WAS READING THIS.

00:49:21.826 --> 00:49:27.364 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT THAT THAT.

00:49:23.794 --> 00:49:28.432 region:rollup2
THE REPORT AND THE THE ANALYSIS

00:49:27.364 --> 00:49:30.000 region:rollup2
THAT ALREADY BEEN DONE IN TERMS

00:49:28.432 --> 00:49:32.002 region:rollup2
OF OF THE LOCATIONS AND.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.138 region:rollup2
WHERE SOME OF THE FACILITIES

00:49:32.002 --> 00:49:35.639 region:rollup2
MICO YOU HAVE A MAP THAT WOULD

00:49:34.138 --> 00:49:36.974 region:rollup2
SHOW US WHERE THESE WOULD BE

00:49:35.639 --> 00:49:38.542 region:rollup2
DEPLOYED STATEWIDE?

00:49:36.974 --> 00:49:40.110 region:rollup2
SO THAT THE PROCESS WE WENT

00:49:38.542 --> 00:49:42.246 region:rollup2
THROUGH AS WE DID A SURVEY WE

00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:43.414 region:rollup2
SURVEYED BASICALLY ALL OF THE

00:49:42.246 --> 00:49:45.082 region:rollup2
STATE AGENCIES TO ASK THEM

00:49:43.414 --> 00:49:47.585 region:rollup2
EXACTLY HOW MANY SPOTS THEY HAVE

00:49:45.082 --> 00:49:48.919 region:rollup2
EXACTLY HOW MANY FLEET THEY.

00:49:47.585 --> 00:49:50.187 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY HAVE STRANDED HOW MANY

00:49:48.919 --> 00:49:52.857 region:rollup2
FLEET THEY HAVE FOR.

00:49:50.187 --> 00:49:54.792 region:rollup2
INTENTIONS TO PURCHASE OVER THE

00:49:52.857 --> 00:49:56.694 region:rollup2
NEXT FOUR YEARS AND SO WE GOT WE

00:49:54.792 --> 00:49:58.996 region:rollup2
GATHERED ALL OF THAT DATA AND SO

00:49:56.694 --> 00:50:00.731 region:rollup2
OUR PLAN IS BASED ON THAT DATA.

00:49:58.996 --> 00:50:01.765 region:rollup2
AS WE'RE GOING OUT EACH OF THE

00:50:00.731 --> 00:50:03.534 region:rollup2
SITES WERE FINDING A LOT OF

00:50:01.765 --> 00:50:05.002 region:rollup2
INACCURACIES IN THE DATA SO

00:50:03.534 --> 00:50:06.904 region:rollup2
WE'RE HAVING TO READJUST BASED

00:50:05.002 --> 00:50:08.906 region:rollup2
ON WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY SEEN OUT

00:50:06.904 --> 00:50:10.841 region:rollup2
IN THE FIELD. I DO HAVE A LIST

00:50:08.906 --> 00:50:12.510 region:rollup2
WITH ME OF THE LOCATIONS THAT WE

00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:13.777 region:rollup2
STARTED WITH THIS YEAR SO I CAN

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:15.312 region:rollup2
SHARE THAT WITH YOU.

00:50:13.777 --> 00:50:16.780 region:rollup2
IT'S ANALYST'S FORM NOT IN A

00:50:15.312 --> 00:50:18.315 region:rollup2
MAP BUT I CAN CERTAINLY PUT IT

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:20.284 region:rollup2
ON A MAP FOR YOU IF THAT'S THAT

00:50:18.315 --> 00:50:21.752 region:rollup2
WOULD BE HELPFUL I THINK FOR FOR

00:50:20.284 --> 00:50:23.287 region:rollup2
FOR FUTURE REFERENCE JUST TO

00:50:21.752 --> 00:50:24.989 region:rollup2
GIVE US AN IDEA OF WHAT THE WET.

00:50:23.287 --> 00:50:26.056 region:rollup2
WHEN IT LOOKS LIKE SHARE MY

00:50:24.989 --> 00:50:27.958 region:rollup2
GUESS ISMOST OF THESE.

00:50:26.056 --> 00:50:29.293 region:rollup2
FACILITIES WILL BE IN URBAN

00:50:27.958 --> 00:50:30.628 region:rollup2
CENTERS BECAUSE THAT THOSE ARE

00:50:29.293 --> 00:50:31.729 region:rollup2
WHERE THE SHORTER THAT'S CORRECT

00:50:30.628 --> 00:50:33.597 region:rollup2
SIR ARE MADE.

00:50:31.729 --> 00:50:35.633 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT WOULD BE REAL HOPE

00:50:33.597 --> 00:50:37.501 region:rollup2
FOR FULL FOR MOST OF US OF I'M A

00:50:35.633 --> 00:50:39.470 region:rollup2
WANNA BE CAREFUL THAT WE'RE NOT

00:50:37.501 --> 00:50:40.938 region:rollup2
ENDING UP PURCHASING VEHICLES

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:44.275 region:rollup2
THAT THAT ARE NOT GOING TO BE

00:50:40.938 --> 00:50:45.709 region:rollup2
UTILIZED BECAUSE IT'S NOT.

00:50:44.275 --> 00:50:47.144 region:rollup2
EITHER AND EFFICIENT TO CHARGE

00:50:45.709 --> 00:50:48.879 region:rollup2
OVER THERE NOT GETTING CHARGED

00:50:47.144 --> 00:50:49.246 region:rollup2
THE E. EIGHTY FIVE EXPERIENCES

00:50:48.879 --> 00:50:51.315 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:50:49.246 --> 00:50:52.716 region:rollup2
WE PURCHASED VERY AB CARS

00:50:51.315 --> 00:50:54.285 region:rollup2
VEHICLES THAT WERE MORE

00:50:52.716 --> 00:50:57.354 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE THAN THEN.

00:50:54.285 --> 00:51:00.524 region:rollup2
A. DUAL USE E. EIGHTY FIVE WITH

00:50:57.354 --> 00:51:01.692 region:rollup2
WITH THAT REGULAR FUEL. AND IT

00:51:00.524 --> 00:51:03.360 region:rollup2
COST US MORE BUT.

00:51:01.692 --> 00:51:04.461 region:rollup2
STAFF DID NOT USE THE E. EIGHTY

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:05.629 region:rollup2
FIVE BECAUSE IT WAS AN

00:51:04.461 --> 00:51:07.798 region:rollup2
INCONVENIENT TO GO OUT.

00:51:05.629 --> 00:51:10.234 region:rollup2
TO THE SITES WHERE YOU COULD

00:51:07.798 --> 00:51:11.168 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY PURCHASE THAT PRODUCT

00:51:10.234 --> 00:51:13.404 region:rollup2
AND SO.

00:51:11.168 --> 00:51:16.206 region:rollup2
IN RURAL AREAS TO BUY AN E.

00:51:13.404 --> 00:51:18.709 region:rollup2
EIGHTY FIVE VEHICLE WAS A REAL

00:51:16.206 --> 00:51:20.411 region:rollup2
WASTE OF MONEY. AND I'M I'M

00:51:18.709 --> 00:51:22.012 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THIS ALL

00:51:20.411 --> 00:51:24.214 region:rollup2
WORKS OUT IN AND AND MAKE THE

00:51:22.012 --> 00:51:25.349 region:rollup2
COMMITMENT TO ACTUALLY USING THE

00:51:24.214 --> 00:51:28.552 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC VEHICLES.

00:51:25.349 --> 00:51:29.887 region:rollup2
IN IN THE REGIONS WHERE IT.

00:51:28.552 --> 00:51:31.322 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE TO DO IT YEAH GET YOUR

00:51:29.887 --> 00:51:33.524 region:rollup2
POINT IS WELL TAKEN WERE

00:51:31.322 --> 00:51:34.959 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY SENSITIVE TO IT WE

00:51:33.524 --> 00:51:37.061 region:rollup2
ARE DEFINITELY PRIORITIZING

00:51:34.959 --> 00:51:38.729 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE'S THE GREATEST USAGE

00:51:37.061 --> 00:51:40.064 region:rollup2
PATTERNS THAT WE'RE SEEING. THE

00:51:38.729 --> 00:51:41.932 region:rollup2
OTHER THING I WANT TO MENTION

00:51:40.064 --> 00:51:43.667 region:rollup2
THOUGH IS THAT IT'S AND THERE'S

00:51:41.932 --> 00:51:44.868 region:rollup2
AN OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW TO

00:51:43.667 --> 00:51:46.437 region:rollup2
LEVERAGE A LOT OF UTILITY

00:51:44.868 --> 00:51:48.572 region:rollup2
FUNDING THAT'S AVAILABLE TO

00:51:46.437 --> 00:51:48.806 region:rollup2
OFFSET. THE STATE COSTS FOR

00:51:48.572 --> 00:51:51.475 region:rollup2
THESE.

00:51:48.806 --> 00:51:52.810 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE INSTALLMENTS AND

00:51:51.475 --> 00:51:54.545 region:rollup2
IN PARTICULAR WITH P. JEANNIE

00:51:52.810 --> 00:51:56.347 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY

00:51:54.545 --> 00:51:57.781 region:rollup2
WITH THEM IN THEIR THAT THEY.

00:51:56.347 --> 00:51:59.049 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM THEY ARE JUST

00:51:57.781 --> 00:52:01.151 region:rollup2
INITIATING ON LAUNCHING THIS

00:51:59.049 --> 00:52:03.387 region:rollup2
YEAR WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE

00:52:01.151 --> 00:52:04.722 region:rollup2
US OUT THE COSTS ENABLE US TO

00:52:03.387 --> 00:52:06.657 region:rollup2
INSTALL MORE THAN WE.

00:52:04.722 --> 00:52:08.092 region:rollup2
WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN ABLE

00:52:06.657 --> 00:52:09.727 region:rollup2
TO DO.

00:52:08.092 --> 00:52:10.928 region:rollup2
SO ARE THE COSTS SO HIGH AND

00:52:09.727 --> 00:52:12.096 region:rollup2
CONNECTIONS GOV YEARS EARLIER

00:52:10.928 --> 00:52:12.763 region:rollup2
QUESTION BECAUSE

00:52:12.096 --> 00:52:14.865 region:rollup2
HAVE YOU WRITTEN LOCAL

00:52:12.763 --> 00:52:16.333 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT I DON'T RECALLS BEING

00:52:14.865 --> 00:52:18.102 region:rollup2
THAT HIGH. WHO INSTALLED ARE THE

00:52:16.333 --> 00:52:19.870 region:rollup2
CHARGING STATIONS FRANKLY AS YOU

00:52:18.102 --> 00:52:21.805 region:rollup2
INSTALL MORE EACH LOCATION THOSE

00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:23.273 region:rollup2
COSTS DOES DIP DOWN THE

00:52:21.805 --> 00:52:25.009 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY IS STILL IN ITS EARLY

00:52:23.273 --> 00:52:26.410 region:rollup2
STAGES BUT WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS

00:52:25.009 --> 00:52:27.811 region:rollup2
THAT WHEN WE HAVE ECONOMIES OF

00:52:26.410 --> 00:52:29.246 region:rollup2
SCALE WE CAN ACTUALLY GET THE

00:52:27.811 --> 00:52:31.348 region:rollup2
BECAUSE MUCH LOWER THAN THAT

00:52:29.246 --> 00:52:33.550 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST THAT? AT EACH LOCATION

00:52:31.348 --> 00:52:35.953 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOT CONSISTENTLY TWENTY

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:37.488 region:rollup2
SPOTS SIR YOU KNOW THIRTY SPOTS

00:52:35.953 --> 00:52:38.355 region:rollup2
SOME OF THEM HAVE THREE OR FOUR

00:52:37.488 --> 00:52:39.456 region:rollup2
BUT THEY STILL HAVE A VERY

00:52:38.355 --> 00:52:41.825 region:rollup2
STRONG NEED BECAUSE THEY HAVE

00:52:39.456 --> 00:52:43.394 region:rollup2
STRANDED FLEET VEHICLES SO WE.

00:52:41.825 --> 00:52:45.496 region:rollup2
ON THOSE SITUATIONS COSTS ARE

00:52:43.394 --> 00:52:46.997 region:rollup2
HIGHER AND ON THE SITUATIONS

00:52:45.496 --> 00:52:48.732 region:rollup2
WHERE WE HAVE MORE EACH SITE THE

00:52:46.997 --> 00:52:50.000 region:rollup2
COSTS ARE MUCH LOWER THEIR

00:52:48.732 --> 00:52:53.237 region:rollup2
AVERAGE YOU YOU PROJECT REACH

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:54.638 region:rollup2
FACILITY I MEAN FOR FIVE OR.

00:52:53.237 --> 00:52:57.408 region:rollup2
THERE ARE DIFFERENT I THINK AT

00:52:54.638 --> 00:52:58.676 region:rollup2
CDC ARE THEY HAVE LARGE NUMBERS

00:52:57.408 --> 00:53:00.144 region:rollup2
AND AND THERE WERE GOING TO BE

00:52:58.676 --> 00:53:03.047 region:rollup2
ABLE TO LEVERAGE THE ECONOMIES

00:53:00.144 --> 00:53:05.282 region:rollup2
OF SCALE. DMV'S SAME THING C. H.

00:53:03.047 --> 00:53:06.116 region:rollup2
P. THOSE ARE DEPARTMENTS WHERE

00:53:05.282 --> 00:53:08.185 region:rollup2
WORK AND HAVE.

00:53:06.116 --> 00:53:10.154 region:rollup2
A LARGE NUMBER OF INSTALLATIONS

00:53:08.185 --> 00:53:12.156 region:rollup2
AND BE ABLE TO KEEP COSTS REALLY

00:53:10.154 --> 00:53:14.191 region:rollup2
LOW PER INSTALLATION.

00:53:12.156 --> 00:53:15.793 region:rollup2
OTHER PLACES.

00:53:14.191 --> 00:53:17.161 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF REHAB OR FISH AND

.

00:59:38.875 --> 00:59:42.813 region:rollup2
THE PRIMARY MOTIVATION FOR THIS

00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:44.081 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL IS TO MAKE IT TOO EASY

00:59:42.813 --> 00:59:45.048 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS ON THE

HE'S.

01:00:05.068 --> 01:00:07.537 region:rollup2
SETTING IT UP THIS WAY WON'T

01:00:06.369 --> 01:00:09.773 region:rollup2
IMPACT THE COSTS IT'S.

01:00:07.537 --> 01:00:11.441 region:rollup2

CORRECT.

01:00:18.748 --> 01:00:21.418 region:rollup2
THE PRO RATA THAT THIS SHIFT TO

01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:22.319 region:rollup2
USING PRO RATA IS BECAUSE IT IS

01:00:21.418 --> 01:00:23.487 region:rollup2

DETERMINE OUR COST RECOVER. AND

01:00:26.723 --> 01:00:29.526 region:rollup2
IT BECOMES A RATE THAT WE CHARGE

CLIENT DEPARTMENTS.

01:00:29.526 --> 01:00:33.029 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO CHANGING THE

IT IS AS A SIDE NOTE I KNOW WE

DID WE TALK ABOUT THE.

01:03:58.401 --> 01:04:01.371 region:rollup2

WHICH WAS OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:25.361 region:rollup2
POACHING AND OUR SECOND ISSUE.

01:04:23.326 --> 01:04:26.663 region:rollup2
WAS THAT WE DID WE USE TO DO
