BEGIN TODAY FOR US. YES IF YOU WOULD STEP TO THE PODIUM THAT WOULD BE GREAT. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE. GREAT PLEASURE I COME BEFORE YOU TODAY. TO SPEAK TO A LONG AGO DREAM. THE DREAM BORN SOME TWENTY ONE YEARS AGO IN A SMALL OFFICE BUILDING FOR ABOUT A HALF A DOZEN OF US SAT DOWN. AND TALKED ABOUT. THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY. AND HOW WE MAY BETTER EMPOWER. TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDERS IN CALIFORNIA FOUNDED WHAT IS NOW CALLED WITH THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER AMERICAN PUBLIC AFFAIRS ASSOCIATION. THROUGH THESE TWENTY ONE YEARS OF PAPA'S MAIN PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN A SCHOLARSHIP LEGISLATURE HAVE ACCEPTED A POP INTERNS IN THEIR OFFICES AND MANY OF THOSE THE GAME THE EMPLOYEE HERE IN THE STATE CAPITAL. INDEED IT HAS ALREADY BEEN SUCCESSFUL. SEVERAL YEARS LATER. A POP BUT DECIDED TO GO NATIONAL. I BELIEVE WE HAVE SOME FORTY FIVE OR MORE CHAPTERS. NOW THROUGHOUT AMERICA. OF A PAPA. THE HEADQUARTERS THIS OUT IN THE THOMAS. THE SENIOR STAFF OPERATE FROM THEIR. COORDINATING AN OPERATING WITH. THE LOCAL CHAPTERS. EARLIER THIS YEAR AND I BELIEVE THIS IS PROBABLY THE FIRST BILL OVER THESE YEARS AT A PAPA HAS SPONSORED. IT HAS SUPPORTED MANY. AND THROUGH ITS POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE IT SUPPORTED MANY CANDIDATES. AND HELP ROOM THOSE CANDIDATES AGAIN SEPARATELY THROUGH THE PACK COMMITTEE. BUT THEIR CONCERN WAS NEEDED TO BE SOME INFORMATION CONVEYED. TO OUR YOUTH. WITHOUT THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE ASIAN PACIFIC GOT PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY. CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS IN AMERICA. AS FOCUSED IN CALIFORNIA. WE LOOKED TO K. TWELVE. AND WHAT THIS BILL SIMPLY DOES IT IS NOT A MANDATE NOT A REQUIREMENT. IT WOULD BE THE RECOMMENDATION. THE API MATTERS WE BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION. OF CALIFORNIA YOUTH THAT THEY MAY THEN BETTER KNOW THE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS. THE HISTORY. IN FACT THE VERY HISTORY OF THIS STATE IS INTERLINKED. WITH ASIANS YOU CAME TO CALIFORNIA. TO FOSTER% AND ACHIEVE THE MODERN MONUMENTAL. INTERCONTINENTAL RAILROAD. THOSE CHINESE INDIVIDUALS. BUT THEIR LIVES AT RISK. THE CROSS THE SIERRAS. AND BRING AMERICA TO THE WEST COAST. SO THIS BILL HAD SIMPLY RECOMMENDS WITH CERTAIN CRITERIA. IMMERSION OR EXPOSURE TO IF YOU WILL. STILL NOT A MANDATE IN K. TWELVE. ELEMENTS ABOUT THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY A MOMENT OF PERSONAL EXPERIENCE ATTORNEY WAS A GREAT. DATE TWO OF AMERICA. ALL WOULD CONCLUDE AFTER THAT THAT WAS A MAJOR MISTAKE. I GOT TO SEE SOME OF THAT UP FRONT AND PERSONAL. SO OUR NEIGHBORS WERE JAPANESE. BOMBERS AND THEY WERE ENTERED. MY DAD WAS ONLY ONE OF MANY- IN OUR CASE WE ASSURED MANY E. THAT WE WOULD TAKE CARE OF HIS LAND. MAINTAINERS EQUIPMENT. WHEN THEY CAME HOME. IT WOULD BE THERE FOR HIM. I REMEMBER MY DAD SOME OF THE ME ONE DAY AND SAY AND TAKE THE TRACTOR. OVER TO BENNY. HE'S BACK. AND HE NEEDS. WE WERE BUT A SMALL EXAMPLE NOT EVEN THE GREATEST EXAMPLE. OF MAKING LIFE THE WRONG INFLICTED ON OUR NEIGHBORS. SOON TURNED. SO THAT WOULD BE MORE OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE HISTORY THAT THE CONTRIBUTIONS. A REIGION. IN ALMOST EVERY SECTOR. SO THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE AS WE HAVE IN OTHER SECTORS BEFORE. SOME INSIGHTS FOR OUR YOUTH. ONE MORE THING I MIGHT ADD ABOUT A POP. WE DECIDED THAT WE WOULD BE AN ASIAN OF AMERICAN PUBLIC AFFAIRS ASSOCIATION. AT OUR INTERNSHIP PROGRAM. SCHOLARSHIPS WOULD BE FOR API YOUTH. BUT WE INCLUDE ALL ETHNICITIES. IN ORDER VETS. AND ARE PLANNING. IN OUR DECISION. SO WE DO THROUGH A PAPA NOT JUST PROMOTE ASIAN. AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS. I HAVE WITH ME TODAY. AS A WITNESS. HE IS. SOMEWHAT NEW TO THE ORGANIZATION EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF A POP. HE IS HERE WITH ANOTHER WITNESS RENEE YANG WHO IS CO FOUNDER OF TECH TEACH A. A. P. I. IF I MAY INTRODUCE MISTER HENRY CHANG ABSOLUTELY I THINK YOU'RE BOTH YOUR WITNESSES ARE HERE IN PERSON THEY ARE SO PLEASE STEP UP TO THE MICROPHONE AND EACH WITNESS WILL HAVE TWO MINUTES. WE ARE ASKING FOR YOUR UNANIMOUS VOTE ON THIS BILL TODAY. BECAUSE IT WILL SET UP POWERFUL MESSAGE TO CALIFORNIA'S API COMMUNITIES THAT ARE STATE AND LEGISLATORS CARE ABOUT THE WILL BE ABOUT THE WELL OUR WELL BEING. ABOUT MAKING SURE OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. ARE NEVER AGAIN THOUGHT OF WERE TREATED AS LESS THAN FOR AMERICANS. AND THEY NEVER HAVE TO EXPERIENCE THE ALIENATING FEELING OF BEING CONSTANTLY ASKED. SO WERE YOU LOOKING FOR ARE YOU REALLY FROM GRASSROOTS MOMENTUM. AND IT'S GROWING BY THE DAY IN JUST THE PAST WEEK.

THROUGH UNFORTUNATE RACISTEVENTS THAT HAPPEN TO BOTH OUR KIDS SEPARATELY. WE HAD BEEN UP TO THEN BEEN BARRED WITH DAILY NEWS ON ANTI ASIAN RACISM BUT IT WAS REALLY SEEN OUR SONS MY SON OVER HERE GO THROUGH WHAT HE WENT THROUGH. THAT HAS REALLY SHAPED AND BECOME THE TIPPING POINT OF WHAT IS TEACH APR TOUGH FOR SHORT. TODAY TODD IS A GRASSROOTS FAST GROWING ORGANIZATION MADE UP OF A COMMUNITY OF DEDICATED API AN ALLY FAMILIES. OUR VISION A SINGLE. TO ENSURE THAT WE CHANGE THE PERCEPTION OF API BY FOCUSING ON THE NEXT GENERATION THROUGH DRIVING CURRICULUM CHANGE IN SCHOOLS AND BEYOND. FOUR APR CHILDREN THIS WORK COULD NOT BE MORE CRITICAL TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR SENSE OF IDENTITY TO THEIR SELF WORTH FOR MY CHILDREN FOR ALL API CHILDREN THEY SHOULD FEEL PRIDE IN YOUR IDENTITY THEY SHOULD FEEL THAT IN AND OUT OF THEIR HOMES. THEY SHOULD BE YOUR FREEDOM TO BE THEIR AUTHENTIC SELVES AND A SENSE OF BELONGING. YOU SHOULD NOT BE PRIVILEGES THAT THEY CAN'T ACCESS AS AMERICANS. I FOR ALL CHILDREN NOT JUST API CHILDREN THIS WORK IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER INTEGRATING THIS CURRICULUM INTO SCHOOLS ENABLE CHILDREN TO GAIN A MUCH BROADER MORE REALISTIC FRAME OF REFERENCE. BOTH WIDENING AND DEEPENING THEIR LANDS SO THAT FUTURE GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS CAN BE MORE CAPABLE. MORE EMPATHETIC AND MORE POWERFUL.

AMERICANS WHO WERE IN TURN I AM HELPING THEM SAVE THEIR FARM AND SO CERTAINLY YOU KNOW YOU AND YOUR FAMILY'S COMMITMENT TO THE API COMEDIAS APPRECIATED- I DO HAVE WHAT DO YOU DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BILL- I'VE HEARD NO TESTIMONY TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT PASSIONATE TESTIMONY TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING API EDUCATION ADDRESSING- API HATE IN FACT- THE API LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS LAST YEAR AND- AGAIN APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE- WE FUNDED THE- API EQUITY BUDGETS- TO ADDRESS- TO HELP SUPPORT- SURVIVORS OF- EIGHTY I HATE TO ACTUALLY FUND PROGRAMS IN SCHOOLS. THAT'S WHAT HEARING AID COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS- THE BOWLING IS PARTICULARLY- RACIALLY MOTIVATED ATTACKS AND BOWLING IN FACT A RECENT STUDY THAT CAME OUT SHOWED THAT OF ALL STUDENTS- ACTUALLY API STUDENTS WERE THE MOST TO REPORT- US SUFFERING FROM- FROM THIS- AND- AND THE MENTAL HEALTH IMPACTS THEIR OFFICE SO THIS IS CERTAINLY A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE AND I APPRECIATE THAT- IN YOUR TESTIMONY YOU POINTED OUT THAT- HOWEVER IS THAT THE BILL ONLY RECOMMENDS AND YOU'VE EMPHASIZED IS NOT A MANDATE- AND- YOU KNOW ANALYSIS. AND I GUESS WHAT MY QUESTION IS THAT- EXACTLY. THINGS THAT THE TEST FIRES IN SUPPORT ACTUALLY SPOKE TO- EXACTLY BY WHAT MECHANISM- WOULD IT ACTUALLY LEAD TO ANY SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE SINCE IT IS A RECOMMENDATION- AT THE ANALYSIS TO TALK ABOUT ENCOURAGES THE ENCOURAGES GOOD BUT- YOU KNOW FRANKLY OUR COMMUNITY NEEDS MORE THAN ENCOURAGEMENT WE'VE BEEN AND- YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE IS THAT- AS POINT THAT WE'VE- BEEN SUBJECT SUBJECTS TO- TO HATE AND HARASSMENT- JUST SIMPLY BECAUSE OF OUR RACE- THE- PANDEMIC BUT EVEN PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC THESE EVENTS HAPPENED SO. EXPLAIN TO ME HOW THIS ACTUALLY. CHANGES ANYTHING- WHAT IS WHAT EXACTLY HOW EXACTLY IS THIS GOING TO. ADDRESS- NO. STUDENTS ACTUALLY LEARNING ANYTHING ABOUT THE API COMMUNITY ASIDE FROM SIMPLY ENCOURAGING AND- THAT- THAT THAT SCHOOLS DO IT SO WHAT'S MECHANISM BY WHICH THIS WOULD ACTUALLY CARRY OUT AND ACTUALLY LEAD TO CHANGE. WELL CENTER PLAN I'D LIKE TO ALLOW. HIM TO EXPAND THE COMMENT IS AS A SPONSOR AND THEN I WILL TYPE IN. DROUGHT. HI AGAIN I'M CHARLES MANSON CHANG I AM OF THE NATIONAL. OPERATIONS AND- BECAUSE- ACTOR FROM A PAPA- IN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION AS WE KNOW- CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT NO MAÅR THE STATE SAYS HAS THE ABILITY TO INDEPENDENTLY OF JEWS WHICH WHAT THEY PUT INTO THEIR CURRICULUM. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES RIGHT NOW IS WHAT IS pNEW FRAMEWORK OR ANYTHING TO HAVE THIS HAPPEN THERE ARE AND I'VE ANALYZED EACH CODE SECTION IN DETAIL EACH SECTION OF THE CURRICULUM AND YOU'VE- YOU HAVE AREAS WHERE THIS BILL VERY SIMPLY ADDS IN- WHEN IT TALKS ABOUT AMERICAN. SECTIONS EVEN IN KINDERGARTEN AND FIRST GRADE OR IT SAYS IN THE CURRICULUM TALKED TO- THE AMERICAN HEROES- API'S AREN'T LISTED ON THAT LIST WE DO HAVE HARRIET TUBMAN AND CESAR CHAVEZ AND- AND- YOU KNOW. THEY WERE HAM LINCOLN AND ALL THESE OTHER PEOPLE AND- EVEN SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS ADDING AN API- CONTRIBUTORS TO SOCIETY FIXES A LOT OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITH CHILDREN. AS YOU KNOW WE ALREADY HAVE- THE ETHNIC STUDIES BILL THAT'S GOING THROUGH IN HIGH SCHOOL- THAT WILL AT SOME POINT MANDATE EDUCATION AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL AND WE ARE ASKING FOR THAT MECHANISM EXISTS IN CALIFORNIA DID A GREAT JOB. THIS IS SAYING- HEY SCHOOL DISTRICT AS A BOARD AS A LEGISLATOR IT SAYS THIS IS OF HIGH IMPORTANCE OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE IT IS IN THAT SENSE AND MANDATE SAYING THIS LEGISLATOR SAYS THIS IS A HIGH PRIORITY ISSUE SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT GOES OUT TO EVERY SCHOOL BOARD IN EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT SO IT HAS THAT POWER WITH IT WE DON'T NEED NEW CURRICULUM TO BE DEVELOPED AS HENRY CHANG MENTIONED- THERE'S ALREADY A LOT OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE- TO HAVE THIS HAPPEN TO WE JUST NEED TO THE LEGISLATOR TO SAY. YES WE SUPPORT THIS AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE PUT IN TO ALL PARTS OF CALIFORNIA'S CURRICULUM AND AGAIN WE'RE NOT REINVENTING THE CURRICULUM WE ARE SIMPLY INSERTING A API AMERICANS THROUGH VARIOUS PARTS OF THE CURRICULUM WE HAVE A WHOLE STUDY WOULD BE HAPPY TO ADD IN THERE- AND I'VE GONE THROUGH SECTION BY SECTION WHICH CURRICULUM POINTS- WOULD WOULD NEED. TO COULD SIMPLY BE ADDED AND THESE ORGANIZATIONS AS MENTIONED WE HAVE FOURTEEN HUNDRED INNOVATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THE CURRICULUMS DEVELOPED IN ALL DIFFERENT AREAS WE JUST NEED THIS LEGISLATOR TO SAY THIS IS A HIGH PRIORITY AREA WE DON'T NEED THIS MANDATED WE NEED THE LEGISLATOR TO SAY THIS NEEDS TO HAPPEN. WE ABOUT THIS VERY GOOD THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN DID YOU ALSO WANT TO CHIME IN. INDEED THIS IS A MOVEMENT. AND MOVEMENTS MOVE THANKS WE'VE SEEN THIS COME SWEEPING ACROSS THE LAND NOW WITH. VARIOUS ASPECTS. OF K. TWELVE EDUCATION. AND A CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY I THINK WE HAVE BEEN AS A STATE SENSITIVE AS DEMONSTRATED HERE IN TESTIMONY. TO THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY. MAYBE IN PARK THE FEELING BAD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE INTERNET. BUT NONE THE LESS A PLUS. AND THAT WAS WHAT I CALL MORAL SUASION. AND THESE ORGANIZATIONS AND THAT IS A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL BE VOICING THEIR OPINIONS. THE LOCAL PEOPLE. WHATEVER THE CHORE OF THE LEGISLATURE SAYING WITH THE SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THESE ISSUES ARE IMPORTANT THEY THEN DISTRICT BY DISTRICT BOARD BY BOARD TO TAKE UP THE CALL. THAT IS DISTRICT. IT CANDIDLY A LOT OF MEMBERS. AND IN EDUCATION AS WELL AS IN THE LEGISLATURE HAVE SOME APPREHENSION ABOUT MANDATE UNFUNDED MANDATES IN THIS LEGISLATURE HAS UNFUNDED MANDATES FOR EVER. AND WE'RE STILL GOING. I THINK THAT IS A NEGATIVE. THE SOCIETY THIS SUASION CARRIAGE PURCHASE AND IT CARRIES PURCHASE BECAUSE I THINK JUST LIKE THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY I THINK MOST CALIFORNIANS CARE. THEY ARE ADVOCATES THANK CENTER NIELSEN CENTER PANTRY OF FURTHER QUESTIONS- YES ACTUALLY- MASON COMETS SO FIRST OF ALL- I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT TESTIMONY SAYING THAT THERE'S CURRICULA OUT THERE SO FORTH AND THERE'S LESS THAN ACTED OUT SPEAKS TO THE CHALLENGE RIGHT- THAT- THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE A LIST OF AMERICAN HEROES AND NONE ARE ASIAN AMERICAN WE KNOW THERE'S MANY OUT THERE- I WOUL ALSO HOWEVER POINT OUT THAT- IS CHAIR OF THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER LET'S LEAVE CAUCUS WE HAVE HEARD FROM- PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT ACTUALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS BILL BECAUSE- IT- DOESN'T ACTUALLY SEEM TO MOVE THE NEEDLE. AND I WOULD JUST POINT OUT SO I THINK FOR MANY MEMBERS ON THE COMMITTEE WHO. WHETHER IT'S YOUR GENDER OR YOUR RACE OR SO FORTH- IT'S GREAT TO HAVE MORAL SUASION BUT- OFTENTIMES IT DOESN'T SEEM TO REALLY MOVE THE NEEDLE VERY MUCH. BY ITSELF. AND SO- AND- THANK- IN FACT THERE WAS REFERENCE MADE IN THE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF SOME OF THE LAWS IN THE OTHER STATES. THOSE LAWS ACTUALLY MANDATED. TEACHING OF API I HISTORY IN THE CURRICULUM THEY DIDN'T SIMPLY SAY SUGGEST THEY MANDATED IT BECAUSE I KNEW A SUGGESTION WAS NOT ENOUGH. AND I WOULD POINT OUT THAT YOU KNOW WE PASSED AND WITH THE L. A. P. I. CARCASS WAS PART OF THE SUPPORT FOR- THE REQUIREMENT FOR ETHNIC STUDIES. WHY DID WE PASS A REQUIREMENT FOR GRADUATION EPIC STUDIES. AND TELL IT AND IT WAS BECAUSE- IT WASN'T HAPPENING IN FACT WE HAD THIS DISCUSSION HERE ABOUT REQUIRED FOR ETHNIC STUDIES AND YOU KNOW AND I HAVE MY OWN YOU KNOW ISSUES IN TERMS OF HOW IT IMPLEMENTS BUT IN THE END. IN ORDER TO MAKE IT HAPPEN AND PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HOW DECADES LATER- NOTHING HAPPENED. SO- YOU KNOW BUT I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME COMMUNICATION WITH THE PAPA ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS BILL IS NOT READY DATA WE NEED TO DO MORE WORK- TO MAKE IT MORE SENSITIVE AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THIS BILLS COMING BEFORE US IN THIS CURRENT FORM AND- SO- YOU KNOW THAT BECAUSE OF THAT UNFORTUNATE I'M NOT ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY- BECAUSE- WE THINK THAT OUR COMMUNITY THE API COMMUNITY. DESERVE SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIVE. THAT WE DON'T WANT YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT BOMBING ALREADY THAT CAN SAID BY THE WAY YOU KNOW WHAT. WE'RE JUST GONNA SUGGEST THINGS FOR YOU IT'S TIME FOR REAL ACTION THE API HATE IS REAL. THE SUFFERING A COMMITTEE IT IS REAL AND IT'S HAPPENING NOW SO- IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE FIRMER STEPS. TO ADDRESS THESE THINGS THE CERTAINLY HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE PROPER ON THESE ISSUES. BUT ARE FRUSTRATED THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN A BROADER DIALOGUE ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND WE SHOULD FOLLOW THE LEAD TO SOME THE OTHER STATES THAT ACTUALLY MANDATE CURRICULA. THERE'S OTHER STATES THAT WERE MENTIONED IN THE TESTIMONY SO- AGAIN CENTER RESIN I APPRECIATE YOUR PAST LEADERSHIP AND THE SUPPORT FOR THE API COMMUNITY- BUT AND I THINK WE'VE TALKED A LITTLE ABOUT THIS BEFORE. THIS BUT WE COULDN'T. JUST DOING SOMETHING IS. THE THAT IS A SUGGESTION I THINK IT'S NOT SUFFICIENT FOR A COMMUNITY. THANK YOU. UNDER THE PLAN WITH YOU PROPOSED AN AMENDMENT WHICH I WOULD ACCEPT MANDATING IT. SO WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST IS THAT WE ACTUALLY AND I THINK- THE- POINT OUT IS THAT WE NEED TO DO WORKS TO ON ITS AGAIN TO. SAY THAT IT'S THAT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS FIGURE OUT WHAT IS AND AGAIN I WISH THAT THE THAT THE- SPONSORS THE BILL HAD COME APPROACH YOUR CAUCUS OF PRIOR TO BILL SUBMISSION DEADLINE. SO YOU CAN WORK ON GETTING SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIVE RIGHT THAT ACTUALLY- POINTS OUT THE VARIOUS AGENCIES IN OUR STATE AND OUR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT WOULD ACTUALLY NEED TO TAKE ACTION SO WE COULD BE MORE SPECIFIC. AND HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY. RIGHT HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY- FOR THE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE TO BE SURE THAT- ALL THE CHILDREN AND I HAVE CHILDREN IN SCHOOL TO IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS. THAT THE CHILDREN- ACTUALLY. WILL ACTUALLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN. ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND- SO WE COULD BUILD ON ETHNIC STUDIES REQUIREMENT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WE CAN DO BUT I MEAN THIS BILL IS FAIRLY SILENT ABOUT ALL THAT. IT DOESN'T TALK ABOUT MECHANISMS RIGHT IT SAYS. IT'S AN EFFORT THAT'S MADE TO THE IMPRIMATUR RIGHT OF THE LEGISLATURE JUST DOING A BILL AND SAY I LIKE THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE BILL. BUT THERE'S NO REQUIREMENTS THERE'S NO TALKING ABOUT WHICH AGENCIES ARE WHO SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE SCHOOL BOARDS THAT THEY SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE IN SOME WAY FURTHERING THE IMPLEMENTATION. SO AGAIN YOU KNOW WE HAD SUGGESTED THAT- THERE'D BE MORE IN DEPTH CONVERSATIONS. AND- AFTER YOU KNOW THE- A TICKET TO FOR THIS OUT- A DUST TIME AND EFFORT TO DO SO- AND- YEAH WE- SO. STOOD TO DO THAT WORK OF UNFORTUNATE WORK HAS NOT BEEN DONE YET. AND SO THAT'S SO THAT'S PROBLEMATIC. SPEAKING OF SNOW FONTENELLE. SENATOR PAN YOU'RE DONE ANYONE ELSE ON THE COMMITTEE HAVE ANY COMMENTS QUESTIONS YES CENTER CORTESE. YES IT IS IT WAS BECAUSE JUST FOR A MOMENT- AND CENTER PANEL ME TO SAY AS OF THOSE OF QUALIFY HER THAT- I'M NOT. OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT- A MEMBER OF THE API COMMUNITY I COMPLETELY RESPECT EVERYTHING THAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT THE NEEDS TO GO. TO GO FURTHER- AND- I DON'T KNOW AMENDMENTS WERE WERE OFFERED IN THAT REGARD I'M NOT THAT UP TO SPEED ON WHAT WAS GOING ON BETWEEN THE COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHOR OF THIS- WHAT AID TO FIND. SOMEWHAT COMPELLING HERE TO **** ME JUST A COMPELLING OPPO'S THE SOURCING IS SOMEWHAT COMPELLING- HAVING GROWN UP IN A IN AN IMPROVING BERMAN ASSEMBLY CENTER NIELSEN. WITH JAPANESE AMERICAN NEIGHBORS- AS WAS THE CASE WITH MY FATHER WHO IS A YOUNG MAN DURING THE INTERMENT. WHO ALSO SERVED IN SWORDS AND TRIED TO CARRY THOSE THOUGHTS FORWARD- MY NEIGHBOR. SERVED IN THE FOUR HUNDRED FORTY SECOND- WHICH WAS OF THE GREATEST COHORT AND WILL WORK OF FIGHTING AND WANT SOME OF WHOM- YOU WERE WERE IMMIGRANTS HERE IS AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM HAS BEEN DECORATED BY THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS WERE OFFERED TO BE DECORATED- TO CALL OUT ATTENTION TO SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY NOT MENTIONED AS FAR AS I KNOW ANY HISTORY BOOK WHATSOEVER NOR IS THERE ANY LEGISLATIVE INTENT- SPOKEN. TO LET PEOPLE KNOW IN TERMS OF LOCAL CONTROL BOARD TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT THEY SHOULD BE. TELLING THAT STORY- THE END- AS A AS AN ITALIAN AMERICAN IT'S EVEN WORSE BECAUSE TELOMERIC INS WERE INTERNED DURING WORLD WAR TWO AS WELL- AMONGST. MY ANCESTORS INCONCURRENT PLAYERS NEED TYLER COMMITTEE THAT'S CALLED THE SECRET HISTORY OF AMERICA IN TERMS OF ITALIAN AMERICANS I WOULD. I DON'T INTEND TO BRING A BILL FORWARD LIKE THAT BUT I WOULD LOVE IT IF THERE WAS A BILL IT SIMPLY SAID. OF THAT THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. DECLARES THAT IT'S IT IT'S INTENT THAT THAT STORY BE TOLD IN SCHOOLS. THROUGHOUT AMERICA WOULD BE BETTER. IF THERE WAS A MANDATE THAT IT BE INCLUDING CURRICULUM AND ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU SAID YES BUT I'M NOT SURE. I WOULD VITIATE THE BILL THAT AT LEAST THE COLORS. THIS IS THE STORY AND IT NEEDS TO BE TOLD. IT NEEDS TO BE TOLD THAT'S A SUGGESTION. BUT IT'S ALSO STATEMENT OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT AND I DO THINK. THERE'S A LONG HISTORY. A SHORT AS I'VE BEEN HERE A LONG PROUD HISTORY OF THE LEGISLATURE- IN. VIEW IN A OWN LEGISLATIVE INTENT BECAUSE OF SOMETHING WITH GROW. AND SOMETHING THAT SHOULD GRAVITAS SO. AND I'M- A LITTLE BIT IN THE BECAUSE I AGREE. IN A RESPECT PROBABLY MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE ROOM YOUR OPINION ON THIS- BUT I'M NOT SURE. I THINK I NEED TO BE AND I BOTH BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO TAKE OUT UNDER THAT THE JUST THE NOTION- THAT THIS IS. A BABY A SMALL STEP BUT A STEP FORWARD YOU DON'T GET A BROAD DECLARATION. IS INTO A MUCH BIGGER ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH. THEM THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU SENATOR OPPORTUNITY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS OKAY BEFORE WE GO TO YOU FOR YOUR CLOSER NIELSEN I WOULD JUST SAY THANK YOU FOR BRING THE BILL FORWARD. THANK YOU DEAR SPONSORS THANK YOU TO ALL THE FOLKS WHO HAVE TESTIFIED- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT SENATOR PAM WE PASSED BILLS ALL THE TIME IN THIS HOUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY TEETH IN THEM. AS YOU WERE WONDERING ABOUT THEM THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM- BUT IT IS ABOUT A MOVEMENT AND IT IS. PEOPLE BEING ENGAGED AND THE YOU KNOW SAYING THAT THIS IS WRONG IN MAKING A STATEMENT OF OUR VALUES- AND I THINK THAT THE AUTHOR HAS INDICATED THAT HE WOULD BE WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU- TO MAKE IT A MANDATE OR PUT UP A LITTLE MORE TEETH INTO THE BILL SO. I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU WILL BOTH WORK TOGETHER IF YOU SO CHOOSE- BUT I THINK I THINK IT'S A GREAT BILL AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO RESPECT ALL OF YOUR- SUPPORTERS WHO'VE COME HERE TO- TESTIFY CENTER NIELSEN. AND APPRECIATE THEM FOR WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND TRYING TO MOVE THE NEEDLE SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE CENTER NIELSEN. WELL I THINK YOUR COMMENTSAND OBSERVATIONS OF YOU AND THE GOOD SENATOR FROM THE VALLEY. REALLY. EMPHASIZE THE POINT. FOR THE FOR. AGAIN THESE. STATE BILL. OUR EVERYDAY OF HERE. AND SOME OF THEM ARE MEANINGLESS AND NOTHING MORE THE STATEMENT THAT I VOWED LONG AGO WHEN I GOT HERE I WAS NOT HERE EACH STATEMENT BILLS I DO NOT LOOK AT THIS AS A STATEMENT BILL. I LOOK AT THIS IS A RALLY THE TROOPS BILL. AND OF COURSE ON SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT AND YET NEGLECTED.

UP TO THE TOP OF THE ORDER SENATOR LEE MON IS HERE TO PRESENT SB TEN FORTY SEVEN SENATOR BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR AND SENATORS SB TEN FORTY SEVEN MAKES SEVERAL IMPORTANT CHANGES TO OUR CURRENT HEALTHCARE SYSTEM PARTICULARLY BY MAKING ENROLLMENT EASIER. FOR PROVIDERS AND FAMILY AS WELL AS PROVIDING MORE CARE TO TODDLERS. AS A WORKING MOTHER WITH AN INFANT I HAVE STRUGGLE WHICH HEALTHCARE OPTIONS MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS FACE THIS SAME STRUGGLE. CURRENTLY OUR SYSTEM IS ONLY SERVING 10% OF ELIGIBLE INFANTS AND TODDLERS. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR INFANT AND TODDLER CARE. AND SB TEN FORTY SEVEN WILL MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE INEFFICIENCIES IN THE SYSTEM. SO IT CAN BETTER SERVE TODDLERS FAMILIES AND PROVIDERS. THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY CHANGES BUT ALLOWS. CHILD CARE PROVIDERS TO BE. IN PARENTS FOR MORE FLEXIBILITY. FIRST THIS BILL WILL OPEN UP THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. TO CHILDREN FROM EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO FIVE YEARS. FINALLY THIS BILL WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR FAMILIES TO ENROLL AND FIFTEEN WORLD IN CHILD CARE. IT EASES THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN ON PARENTS AND PROVIDERS BY ESTABLISHING A TWENTY FOR TWENTY FOUR MONTHS OF CONTINUOUS ELIGIBILITY. AND ALLOWING FOR CATEGORICAL ELIGIBILITY. IF A PARENT CAN SHOW THAT THEY ARE ENROLLED IN OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE MEDICARE ALL. CALFRESH WICKET AND HEAD START THEY ARE PRESUMED ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIZED CHILD CARE. TODAY WITHOUT ME I HAVE NINA BT FROM EVERY CHILD CALIFORNIA AND I READ BERNARDO APPARENT TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. TERRIFIC THANK YOU SENATOR LIMÓN AND I BELIEVE BOTH OF YOUR WITNESSES ARE CALLING IN. A MADAM A MODERATOR IF YOU CAN OPEN THE LINES FOR IRENE FOR NOT L. AND THEN FOR NEED TO BIRTH THE- BHUVI SARINA. AND BOTH OF YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. I REMEMBER AND I DON'T. WE SURE CAN- GOOD MORNING SENATE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND ENERGIZING BERNARDO AND MY HUSBAND AND I LIVE IN HAYWARD INFORMED DISTRICT HAS. BECOME FORTY SEVEN BRIDESMAIDS. THANK THEM CALIFORNIA PRESCHOOL PROGRAM FOR YOUNG CHILDREN AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR FAMILY TO ACCESS IN CHILD CARE. MY FRIEND THREE YEARS AND THE YOUNGEST. OF BOTH OF MY BOYS I CAN AN IN AND CARE IN I DON'T. HOWEVER WHEN HIGH TURN THREE YET TO READ AND GAMBLE HIM ANOTHER WHAT'S AND YOU. HE HAD HEALTHCARE FOR CHILDREN HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY HELPFUL. IT'S BEEN GREAT TO HAVE MY- CALLED AND THE THING. I'M NOT EVEN LEARN HOW TO NAB ASSEMBLY MEMBER. AND WITH THE COLD DARKISH ALL DIFFERENT ALREADY BEEN ATTENDING ANYTHING UNTIL THE PRO. WELL MY PROCESS THE MOMENT ACTUALLY. WORKED WITH ME FOR A THREE HOUR THE PEOPLE. TO LIKE. YOU CAN RECTIFY WHAT I APPRECIATE ABOUT THIS BILL IS THAT IT CREATES CONTINUITY OF CARE FOR CHILDREN TO MAKE CENTER A PROGRAM THAT THEFIRST THE WORLD IN YOU TO THE RECERTIFICATION PROCESS HI AND MY YOUNGER SON ARE NO LONGER THE SAME CHILD CARE CENTER. IF I'VE MADE MY COMMUTE VERY CHALLENGING I ALSO HAD TO CUT BACK ON WORK HOURS AND CANCEL MOST OF MY- AND GAVE ACTIVITIES FOR MY FAMILY. AT THE FORTY SEVEN TO MAKE LIKE YOU CAN FOR PARENTS LIKE ME ACTIVE QUALITY CHILDCARE PRESCHOOL. THANKS FOR COMING TO. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT NINA PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU SO MUCH OUR CHAIRMAN LEYVA AND COMMITTEE NUMBERS MY NAME IS NINA THREE PM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF COVERAGE HOW CALIFORNIA A STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING SIXTEEN HUNDRED EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION PROVIDERS AND A CO SPONSOR OF THE BELT. I'M ASKING HEARD SB TEN FORTY SEVEN WHICH STRENGTHENED THE SUSPECT EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION PERCENT ENABLE PROVIDERS TO BETTER SERVE THE NEEDS OF OUR CHILDREN AND FAMILY ESPECIALLY TODDLERS WHERE WE KNOW THERE IS THE GREATEST NEED. AND ACCORDING TO THE EARLY LEARNING CARE MASTER PLN ONLY ONE IN FIVE CHILDREN WHO ARE ELIGIBLE ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN STATE SUBSIDIZED CRIME. SB TEN THIRTY SEVEN OPEN UP THE PRISON PRO TO SEARCH. EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO FIVE RATHER THAN ONLY THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLD IT ALSO PROVIDES PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY I'M TO TRANSFER BETWEEN. CONTRACTS OUR GOAL WITH THIS BILL IS TO EXPAND AGE ELIGIBILITY WHILE MAINTAINING QUALITY TITLE FIVE STANDARDS AN APPROPRIATE AGE RATIOS. TO ENSURE THAT ALL PROGRAMS CAN FULLY EXPAND THEIR CONTRACTS AND SERVE THE CHILDREN IN THEIR COMMUNITY. THERE'S ALSO A NUMBER OF OTHER PROVISIONS IN HERE SUCH AS PROVIDERS WOULD BE REIMBURSED BASED ON CHILD ENROLLMENT RATHER THAN ATTENDANCE. PROVIDING MORE STABILITY AND ENABLING FAMILIES TO FULLY UTILIZE THEIR CONTRACT FUNDS TO SERVE CHILDREN. RATHER THAN RETURNING FUNDING TO THE STATE. IT FURTHER EXPANDS FAMILY CHILDCARE EDUCATION NETWORK SO THAT FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS CONSORTIUM IN THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM WHICH WE THINK IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE MORE CHOICES. FOR PARENTS AND FAMILIES- ALSO MAKES CATEGORICAL ELIGIBILITY THERE WHICH WOULD REDUCE SOME OF THAT BURDEN SOME PAPERWORK FOR FAMILIES AND PROGRAMS. AND WE FEEL THAT IT WOULD MOVE TOWARDS A MORE EQUITABLE SYSTEM FOR LOW INCOME WORKING FAMILIES CAN GET TWENTY FOUR MONTHS OF ELIGIBILITY FOR CHILD CARE. SO THAT THEY WORK AND THEIR CHILDREN CAN LEARN IN A STABLE HIGH QUALITY ENVIRONMENT. FOR ALL O THOSE REASONS I URGE YOUR SUPPORT SB TEN FORTY SEVEN THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

BILL WERE THE PART OF THE CONTRACTING NEGOTIATION PROCESS LIKE MAKING REIMBURSEMENTS BASED ON ENROLLMENT SAID ATTENDANCE THAT'S BEEN OMITTED FROM THE BILL WE ALSO REMOVE THE PROVISIONS ALLOWING FOR PROVIDERS TO SHIFT BETWEEN. CCS P. AND OTHER CONTRACTS BECAUSE THAT WAS INCLUDED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET- AND WE ALSO INCLUDED PRIORITY FOR THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS SO THOSE ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR AND THE VETO MESSAGE. AT WAS THAT IT WAS PREMATURE AND IT WASN'T IN THE BUDGET- IN THE JANUARY BUDGET- THE GOVERNOR HAS SOME ELEMENTS HERE ARE L. ON HAS SOME OF THE ELEMENTS THAT ARE IN THE BILL BUT OUR ELEMENTS FOR MORE EXPANSIVE. SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THE JANUARY BUDGET- THE GOVERNOR AT PUT A PROVISION IN FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITY AND WE ADDED STUDENTS- JUST. IN STUDENT- YOU KNOW ANOTHER PROVISION IN THE JANUARY BUDGET IS THAT IT. STARTS AT TWENTY FOUR MONTHS WE STARTED EIGHTEEN MONTHS SO THERE'S DEFINITELY SOME DIFFERENCES- BUT- THE ELEMENTS THAT THE GOVERNOR HAD ASKED TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE BUDGET- ARE IN THE GENERAL VERSION OF THE BUDGET.

THAT CHAIR AND MEMBERS- THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY I WANT O PARTICULARLY THANK YOUR STAFF IN OLGA LUCIA RAMIREZ FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS REALLY IMPORTANT BILL- TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT. SB TWELVE EIGHTY EIGHT. AS THE FIRST STEP THE FIRST STEP IN THIS PROCESS TO REMOVE SARAN'S HASTINGS NAME FROM THE COLLEGE OF THE LAW AND PROVIDE SOME RESTORATIVE JUSTICE AUTHORS- SENATOR HERTZBERG AND SENATOR WIENER- FOR THOSE OF YOU DON'T KNOW UC HASTINGS IS THE EXCELLENT INSTITUTION A- WONDERFUL INSTITUTION IS PROVIDED MORE JUDGES AND MORE LAWYERS THAN ANY OTHER LAW SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA FACT WAS THE FIRST LAW SCHOOL WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI. OF THE NUMBER OF PROMINENT ONE NINE WHO HAVE GRADUATED FROM UC HASTINGS AMONG THEM ARE VICE PRESIDENT. WILLIE BROWN. JACKIE SPEAR- THE ISSUE THAT BRINGS US HERE TODAY THOUGH IS LOOKING BACK IN THE HISTORY OF SARANDA SEES THINGS WHO WAS SADLY THE FIRST CHIEF JUSTICE CITY CALIFORNIA- IN. HIS AXE ACTIVITIES IN HORRIFIC ACTIONS. IN A SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY THE HASTINGS LEGACY REVIEW COMMITTEE DELIVERED A REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS THE DETAILED THE FINDINGS OF SERENA'S HASTINGS AND HIS INVOLVEMENT A SERIES OF MASSACRES OF NATIVE AMERICANS OTHER REPORT FOUND THAT HASTINGS PLANNED AND FUNDED A SERIES OF MASSACRES IN AROUND THE COUNTY. OF MENDOCINO DURING THE EIGHTEEN FIFTIES. WHAT'S IT COOLEY SAID IS THE FACT THAT THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. REIMBURSED SARAN'S HASTINGS FOR HIS EXPENSES IN THIS MASSACRE OF THE SCHOOL HERE HERE FROM TODAY ONCE THE HASTINGS NAME REMOVED AS DO ALL THREE OF US- DURING THE COLLEGE'S FOUNDING PROCESS HASTINGS HAD A PROVISION INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION CODE. REQUIRING THAT THE UNIVERSITY FOREVER BE KNOWN AS THE HASTINGS COLLEGE OF THE LAW AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE REQUIRES A STATUTORY CHANGE TO REMOVE HIS NAME. OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO REMOVE HASTINGS NAME FROM THE COLLEGE. AND THAT'S THE WORK THAT WE'RE BEGINNING HERE TODAY- THIS THE BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS- WE'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITYTO MEET WITH PRESIDENT RUSS- AND WE HAVE COMMITTED TO A CONTINUING CONVERSATION ABOUT NOT JUST REMOVING THE NAME HASTINGS BUT ALSO. WHAT ELSE CAN BE DONE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WRONG AND TO PROVIDE SOME SOME THE WRONG WILL NEVER BE RIGHTED THE WRONG WILL NEVER BE RIGHTED BUT TO PROVIDE. SOMETHING TO RECOGNIZE THE WRONGFUL BEHAVIOR OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND AMONG THOSE IDEAS THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED AMONG THOSE IDEAS THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY EVEN REDUCED ALLEGE COUNCIL SO THAT THE NEXT STEP IN THE PROCESS OF FOR FORTUNATE TO HAVE THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD. THE THAT WE INCLUDE PORTIONS OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE FOR EXAMPLE PUBLIC MEMORIAL TO THE YOU KEEP PEOPLE A WEBSITE TO ENGAGE THE PUBLIC AND EDUCATE THE PUBLIC AS TO THESE ATROCITIES AND HOWARD. HOW WE'RE WORKING TO. ADDRESS THEM TODAY A CLINIC EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM IN THE ROUND VALLEY WHICH IS THE AREA THAT WAS MOST DRAMATICALLY IMPACTED AND THEN THE NATIVE AMERICANS MOST DRAMATICALLY IMPACTED A PRO BONO LEGAL SERVICES ESTABLISHING A MUSEUM. A NATIVE AMERICAN LAW PROGRAM ASSISTANCE IN OBTAINING GRANTS AND STATE PROGRAMS IN A NUMBER OF OTHER ITEMS AT THE LAW SCHOOL IS DISCUSSING WITH THE UKEE TRIBE IN THE ROUND VALLEY DRIVE. THESE ARE JUST RECOMMENDATIONS WE THE LEGISLATURE CAN'T FOR IN A THESE UPON. UC HASTINGS OF THE SCHOOL I HOPE THAT WILL BE FORMALLY KNOWN AS UC HASTINGS BUT BUT THESE WILL BE OUR STRONG STRONG. RECOMMENDATIONS OUT WITH ME HERE IS OUR JOINT AUTHORS I MENTIONED AT THE OUTSET SENATOR WIENER CENTER WIENER. INTO THANK YOU CENTER HERTZBERG MORNING COLLEAGUES I. TYPICALLY HAVE MULTIPLE PRESENTERS- I'M REALLY UNDER YOUR CENTER HERTZBERG AND CENTER ON BURGER COULD ALUMNI IF HE SINGS I HAVE THE HONOR OF. REPRESENTING THE COMMUNITY THAT INCLUDES UC HASTINGS SO IN MANY WAYS THIS IS IN SOME WAYS THIS IS A THIS IS IN PART A DISTRICT ISSUE IT ALSO GOES BEYOND THAT BECAUSE- OF THE ATROCITIES COMMITTED AGAINST. OF THE IMPACT OF DRIVERS FOR UC'S THINGS IS A MAJOR- INSTITUTION IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO IT HAS. PRODUCED SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL LEADERSHIP AND LEGAL LEADERSHIP AND OUR CITY- AND THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE ALL VERY PROUD. OF THIS AMAZING LAW SCHOOL IN SAN FRANCISCO. SAN FRANCISCO THE SERVICES WERE ALSO HORRIFIED- WHEN THEY LEARNED- THAT- THAT MISTER HASTINGS OFF FROM THE SCHOOLS NAMES. ARE COMMITTED GENOCIDE- AGAIN STRIDES LITERALLY ATTEMPTED TO WIPE THEM OFF THE FACE OF THE PLANET- AND WHEN AND EXTERMINATED A LARGE NUMBER. OF TRIBAL MEMBERS- AND HIS NAME NEVER SEVEN PLACED ON THE SCHOOL FROM THE OUTSIDE- BUT- AT SOME POINT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT HAPPENED. AND THEN MOVE FORWARD- AND SO IN SAN FRANCISCO I'M HAVING THE NAME HASTINGS ON THE SCHOOL IS A SCAR ON OUR CITY PEOPLE IN SAN FRANCISCO WANT THIS NAME GONE THEY'RE PROUD OF THIS LAW CHOOL WHO DO NOT WANT THIS NAME. TO BE ON THE SCHOOL IT IS AN EMBARRASSMENT FOR OUR CITY TO HAVE A MAJOR INSTITUTION NAME FOR SOMEONE WHO LITERALLY EXTERMINATED NATIVE AMERICANS LIVING IN THIS. OP ED AND ARE IN OUR STATE- AND SO- IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR MY COMMUNITY THAT THIS NAME BE STRIPPED OFF- OF THE SCHOOL. IT IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT FOR MY COMMUNITY OF SAN FRANCISCO- THAT WE DO WHAT WE CAN TO SUPPORT THE TRIBES. ARE THE IMPACT OF TRIBES- AND SO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH UC HASTINGS- AND OTHERS AND IT'S BEEN MY HONOR TO BE IN MEETINGS- BOTH LIVE AND THE ASSUME- WITH- REPRESENTATIVES OF THE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES- AND THAT'S CENTER ON BURKE MENTIONED- IT IS OUR- INTENT AND WE WILL- MAKE AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL. TO INCLUDE ELEMENTS OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE I IN TERMS OF TANGIBLE WAYS OF SUPPORTING- THESE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES THAT TO THIS DAY SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES. OF WHAT'S AROUND US HASTINGS DID A HUNDRED SEVENTY YEARS AGO. THESE THESE HARMS TO GO AWAY AND A FEW YEARS. THEY CAN LAST FOR GENERATIONS FOR CENTURIES AND SO IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE STEP UP- ON THE USED NOT UC HASTINGS BUT MORE BROADLY FROM THAT- STEP UP TO SUPPORT THE TRIBES INTO ENGAGE. IN RESTORATIVE JUSTICE TO START TO START HEALING THE HARMS THAT WERE CAUSED BY SYRINGE HISSING BUT BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE WE KNOW THIS STATE THAT WROTE THIS THE IT WAS NOT UNFORTUNATELY STARTED HIS IS NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO DID US IN CALIFORNIA- AND THE STATE WAS PART OF THIS FOR VARIOUS TRIBES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND SO- I'M PROUD TO JOIN AUTHOR OF THIS BILL I DO WANT TO SAY- THAT IN TERMS OF THE NAMING- OF THE SCHOOL THE UC HASTINGS BOARD DIRECTORS HAS ON IT AS ADOPTED- A MEASURE IN TERMS OF WHAT IT WANTS ITS NAME- TO BE. OFFER ANY SCHOOL HIGHER EDUCATION THE NAME OF THE SCHOOL- IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT IN MY VIEW- THAT THE THAT THE COLLEGE IN THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY- YOUR BE- OKAY WITH WHAT THE SCHOOL'S NAME IS THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT NAME FOREVER IN TERMS OF THEIR STUDENT BODY. AND THEIR ALUMNI AND SO ON AND SO FORTH- AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO. WORKING UNDER THE A BILL THE ASSEMBLY AS WELL BY SOMEONE RAMOS- I HAVE PROBABLY HAD. TWENTY DIFFERENT PHONE CALLS AND MEETINGS WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SO I HAVE MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALSO. A COMMUNICATED WITH HIM- I KNOW THAT WE'RE ALL GOING TO WORK TOGETHER. HASTINGS WITH THE TRIBES OF MISTER RAMOS AND I AM CONFIDENT THAT IN THE END WE WILL HAVE ONE BILL THAT WE WILL ALL BE BEHIND THAT I REALLY LOOK FORWARD. TO THAT SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER WIENER CENTER HERTZBERG. WITH SAID REALLY BEEN HONORED TO WORK WITH MY- JOINT AUTHORS ON THIS MEASURE THEY'VE BEEN PASSIONATE THEY'VE DONE THE HOMEWORK. AND SPEND JUST AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF TIME AND I THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH- AND I'M POINT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE MANAGER WHILE I.

HE'S ONLY A YEAR AND I ALSO WANT I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYBODY HERE WOOD I GUESS DR PASSER IN THE ASSEMBLY DOTSON WILSON WAS IN THE CLASS TWO. WHO IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THIS INSTITUTION I JUST WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIM ALWAYS ACKNOWLEDGE HIM. I DON'T WANT TO SAY IS THAT TO. HISTORY IS WHAT IT IS WE CAN'T CHANGE IT. WE HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION TO CHANGE OUR RELATIONSHIP TO IT. DO WE EMBRACE IT OR NOT- YOU KNOW A HASTINGS IMPORTANT PLACE THEY SAY IT'S THE- HARVARD OF THE WEST I WOULD SAY HARVARD IS THE HASTINGS OF THE EAST.

AND SHE HAS TOO MANY HERE. YOU GO AHEAD MICELLES ON THE OKAY GREAT THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS VIRGINIA DARI UNDERSTANDABLE I'M A COLLEGE A LONG QUESTION AB ONE AND AN ADJUNCT PROFESSOR I TEACH THE GOVERNMENT LAW CLINIC I WAS A MEMBER OF THE COLLEGE OF LEGACY COMMITTEE AND TRANSITION TO THE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE INVITES REPORT I HAVE A BACKGROUND IN AMERICAN INDIAN HISTORY AND LOCK IN AGREED TO SERVE ON THESE COMMITTEES. BECAUSE I STRONGLY BELIEVE IN THE PRINCIPLE OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE. I WANT TO PUT MY AND PROFESSIONAL. TO USE ADDRESSING THE ONGOING CONSEQUENCES OF THE GENOCIDE INFLICTED UPON THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF THE STATE. WE HAVE REAL PEOPLE WHO WERE TREATED AS INCONVENIENT. TO THE OWNERSHIP OF CALIFORNIA'S GOLDEN RESOURCES. I SUPPORT REMOVING SERRANO FACING CLAIMS FROM THE INSTITUTION THAT TRAINS SOME OF THE FINEST LAWYERS MANY DEDICATED TO PUBLIC SERVICE. MANY ACTUALLY HERE IN HERE HEARING WELL. WHAT LAW SCHOOL CLASSMATES MY ALUMNI COLLEGE. COLLEAGUES AND I WERE HORRIFIED TO LEARN. OF THE COLLEGE FOUNDERS ROLE IN THE GENOCIDAL POLICIES THAT ACCOMPANIED THE BILL RATES TO CHOIR LANDED WELCOME CALIFORNIA. THIS STATE WITH NO EXCEPTIONS TO THIS SHAMEFUL HISTORY OF THE TREATMENT OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE IN THE CONQUEST OF THIS COUNTRY WHICH THE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE ADVISORY BOARD AND THE COLLEGE HAS MADE SOME PROGRESS WITH THE DRAFTING. SHAMEFUL LEGACY. ESTABLISHING THE INDIGENOUS LAWCENTER. CREATING SPACE IN THE LOBBY OF THE MADE IN MINISTRATIONS BUILDING ON CAMPUS TO COMMEMORATE AND HONOR THE YOU KEEP PEOPLE. HOSTING CONFERENCES AND SPEAKERS ON INDIGENOUS LEGAL ISSUES. FUNDING PUBLIC INTEREST FELLOWS IN THE CAR EUREKA TO WORK ON INDIGENOUS LEGAL MATTERS. BUT IN DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU KEY DEFENDANTS. BROWN VALLEY INDIAN COMMUNITY AMONG MEMBERS OF THE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE ADVISORY BOARD WE ALWAYS COME BACK TO THE ELEPHANT AND- THE NAME OF THE COLLEGE. IN ORDER TO MOVE FORWARD WE HAVE TO CONFRONT JEFF STREET NOT CONTINUE TO DEBATE. IT'S AN HONOR TO HAVE YOUR NAME ON A PUBLIC INSTITUTION THE TERM OF CONQUEST CANNOT BE ERASED OR MINIMIZED BUT WE CAN TAKE THE SMALL STEPS WILL BE MOVING THE HONORING OF THOSE. WHO CONTRIBUTED TO THIS TRAUMA. A BILL TO SIMPLY DO NOT DESERVE TO BE SO ON EDGE. I THANK THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR TAKING UP THE TIME. MATTER AND ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT MISS CARILLO YOU ARE UP NEXT YEAR TWO MINUTES ALSO MY NAME IS JOE CARILLO I AM PROFESSOR OF LAW AND FACULTY DIRECTOR OF THE ACADEMIC INDIGENOUS LAWCENTER AT THE COLLEGE. I'VE BEEN ON THE FACULTY. FOR THIRTY ONE YEARS I T. EACH PROPERTY AND VOTER INDIAN. I ON THE LEGACY REVIEW COMMITTEE FOR THREE I AM NOW TO YEARS THE U. K. RESTORED OR JOE OF BOARD. I A BEEN PARTY TO OF RESTORATIVE CONVERSE IN BY AND AFTER COLLEGE AND BY AND AT MOUNT VALLEY- I CONTINUE TO WHOLEHEARTEDLY CONTINUE TO SUPPORT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE AT THE COLLEGE AND ACROSS THE STATE EIGHTY EIGHT IT DOES TWO THINGS ONE IT REMOVES RAN AS HIS TEAM'S NAME FROM THE COLLEGE STRONG MAJORITY OF STAKEHOLDERS AGREED THIS IS NECESSARY TO IT LOCATES THE COLLEGE GEOGRAPHICALLY. IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA APOLOGIZE FOR OVER A CENTURY OF DEPREDATIONS AND PREJUDICIAL POLICIES AGAINST CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICANS AND ESTABLISHED A TRUTH AND HEALING COMMISSION. IN LIGHT OF THAT APOLOGY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE LAW SCHOOL WAS FOUNDED IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT IN SAN FRANCISCO IS A FAR MORE NEUTRAL REFERENCE THAN RETAINING ANY EARLY STATEHOOD AFTER HIS NAME WOULD BE. ALONG THE SAME LINES I FIND SB TWELVE EIGHTY EIGHT IMPLICITLY RESPECTFUL. OF THE CURRENT PROTOCOL SURROUNDING TRIBAL LANDED KNOWLEDGE MINTS ACROSS THE STATE. ON THE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE ISSUE I BELIEVE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE SHOULD BE MORE THAN SYMBOLIC. THE IDEA THAT LEGISLATION COULD DECLARE A BENCHMARK FOR RESTORATIVE JUSTICE IN THE ABSTRACT IS APPEALING. BUT ONLY IF THE PROMISES MADE MADE WITHIN ANY PIECE OF LEGISLATION CAN IN FACT BE REALIZED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE AFFECTED NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. OTHERWISE ANY LIST RISKS BECOMING JUST ANOTHER SYMBOL. WHILE LEGISLATION CAN BEGIN TO DEFINE A BENCHMARK OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE SB TWELVE EIGHTY EIGHT DOES NOT TAKE THAT STEP IN THE ABSTRACT YET THIS BILL IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD. IT LEAVES THE DOOR OPEN FOR MEANINGFUL PARTNERSHIP GOING FORWARD TO DEFINE WHAT REAL RESTORATIVE JUSTICE CONVENE IN A PARTICULAR CONTEXT. FOR THESE REASONS I SUPPORT S. B. TWELVE EIGHTY EIGHT AND I THANK THE SENATORS FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OR IT WILL COME HERE TO ROUTE TWENTY TWO HUNDRED ANYONE WHO WISHES TO STATE THEIR NAME IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. PLEASE COME FORWARD.

HAD ANY INVOLVEMENT IN ANY OF THE DASTARDLY ACTIONS. AGAINST NATIVE AMERICANS DURING MENTAL SCENE- INDIAN WARS AND WHAT THEY'RE CALLED. ARE THEY WERE WARS BUT HASTINGS DID NOT START CONSPIRE IN FACILITY OR SERVE IN THOSE WARS. IN FACT THE ONLY DIRECT EVIDENCE OF WHETHER HASTINGS WAS COMPLICIT IN THOSE WARS IS HIS SWORN TESTIMONY GIVEN IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY. IN THE LEGISLATURE'S INVESTIGATION WHICH DID NOT EVEN SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY. IN THE WHITE PAPER THAT THE- THE COLLEGE COMMISSION AND FORM THE BASIS FOR THIS ATTEMPT TO CHANGE THE NAME. WHAT HASTINGS ACTUALLY DID. WAS USE THE EXISTING LAWS TO PROTECT HIMSELF AND OTHER SETTLERS FROM THE VIOLENCE PERPETRATED ON THEM BY NATIVE AMERICANS.

INVITED WITH IT THE ABILITY TO CARRY OUT THE GOVERNOR'S INSTRUCTIONS. HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW IS AN INSTITUTION. THE OLDEST PUBLIC LAWSUIT LAW SCHOOL IN THE STATE.

HASTINGS DESCENDANT ALWAYS HAD TO BE ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THAT'S CONTINUED FOR A HUNDRED FORTY FOUR YEARS. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WAS INDEPENDENT OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THE SCHOOL WOULD FOREVER BE KNOWN AS HASTINGS COLLEGE OF THE LAW. IF YOU DIDN'T HEAR THAT LET ME REPEAT IT FOR EVER KNOWN AS THE HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW YOUR TWO MINUTES PLEASE REFEREE GOOD IN EVERY TIME ANY GOVERNMENT OR PERSON HAS TRIED TO CHANGE THESE CONTRACT TERMS.

GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS JAMES RESTS ON THE DELAY LIKE TO PRESIDENT ROUND ON THE INDIAN TRIBES AND I'D LIKE TO JUST EXPRESS MY- STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL BUT I'D LIKE TO BE CLEAR ON WHAT WHAT THE TRIBAL COUNCIL- IS OPPOSING AND SO WHAT I APPRECIATE THAT SIR BUT WE HAD OUR LEAD OPPOSITION JUST LIKE WE HAD OUR LEAD SUPPORT AND THEN WE GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN STATE YOUR NAME AND SUPPORTER OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SO WE WERE REQUIRED TO AS OPPOSING THE BILL IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEND SOMETHING TO THE COMMITTEE SO THAT WE CAN PUT IN THE RECORD PLEASE FEEL FREE TO DO THAT THERE WAS A LETTER SENT YESTERDAY AND WE HAVE IT THE MANAGER OF ONE OF I GUESS ORDER QUESTION. WOULD BEAPPROPRIATE IN OUR COMMENTARY TO ASK QUESTIONS FOR EXAMPLEOF THE TRIBAL LEADERS ABSOLUTELY THE WILL THAT THAT'S AN OPTION AS A AS A COMMITTEE MEMBER HE WAS CERTAINLY MAY DO THAT THANK SOME I'M TRYING TO KEEP THE DECORUM OF THE- OF THE COMMITTEE ALL RIGHT WE'RE GONNA GO BACK TO SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I. FIRST WANTED TO SAY THAT. I KNOW YOU YOU HAVE A TOUGH JOB OF TRYING TO- GET PUBLIC TESTIMONY AT THE SAME TIME. YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE SENATORS ARE SITTING HERE MAKING DECISIONS AS OF LAST NIGHT I WAS LOBBIED OR BROUGHT INFORMATION ON THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION WHICH IS. A BIG DEAL THIS IS A BIG DEAL WE HAVE THREE SENATORS. HERE MANY AS MUCH TIME AS THEY WANT- TO EXPLAIN THEIR SIDE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND WE HAVE OPPOSITION. WHO GETS TWO MINUTES AND I THINK THAT I KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO RUN MEETINGS BUT IT'S NOT FAIR TO EVEN US AS- AS LEGISLATORS WHO ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT HAPPENED A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY YEAR HUNDRED FORTY FOUR YEARS AGO. AND WHAT WAS WRONG AND HOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT RIGHT AND THOSE ARE TOUGH DECISIONS. AND THE DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE. IMPACT NATIVE AMERICANS IMPACT. PEOPLE WHO WENT TO THEIR SCHOOL AND I REPRESENT. ELEVEN COUNTIES AND I HAVE VERY. A DIVERSE AMOUNT OF NATIVE AMERICANS WHO WERE WRONGED. I WASN'T THERE WHEN THEY WERE WRONG BUT THEY WERE WRONG IN THEIR HISTORY- IT. IS REALLY SAD FOR OUR STATE AND FOR OUR NATION BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT ARE GOING TO GO INTO THE FUTURE ON THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST AND MANY THINGS HAVE HAPPENED OVER THESE LONG PERIODS OF TIME. AND SO THERE'S A BILL IN THE ASSEMBLY THERE'S A LOT MOVING IN THIS AREA OF WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THIS NAMING OF THE SCHOOL. I'M NOT GONNA VOTE FOR THE BILL TODAY ON A LAYOFF THE BILL BECAUSE I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE QUITE FRANKLY A LOT MORE DISCUSSION A LOT MORE- INFORMATION BROUGHT FORWARD BUT I WOULD JUST SAY THAT I THINK THE PROCESS. THAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH IS UNFORTUNATELY WHEN WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY HERE ALL ALL ALL THE TESTIMONY. AND GET ALL THE FACTS- BROCK ROB FORD. THIS BILL IMPACTS. THE SENATOR FROM THE SECOND DISTRICT AS WELL. WHO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING HIS CAUGHT A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT SO- WE'RE GONNA MAKE A DECISION ON SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED. LITERALLY OVER A HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS AGO AND WE WERE IN THERE AND THE FACTS NEED TO BE. VERY CLEARED SO WE CAN MAKE GOOD DECISIONS THAT'S WHAT I WANNA SAY TODAY SO I THINK IT'S PREMATURE AND MOVING THE BILL FORWARD QUITE RIGHT. UNTIL WE HAVE THOSE FACTS. THANK YOU SIR AT ALL AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THIS IS OUR PROCESS AND IF THE IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE PROCESS WE NEED TO TAKE THAT UP WITH THE RULES COMMITTEE. SAN REQUIRE YOU'RE UP NEXT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. VENTURE INTO A WANNA SAY. HOW GRATEFUL I AM- BE ABLE TO HAVE THIS HEARING THANK YOU TO THE- THREE LEADERS HERE IN THE SENATE FOCUS ON THE STEINORTH. THANK YOU. RIGHT TO PRESENT RUSS IN THE MEMBERS. OF ARAMBULA INDIAN TRIBES AS WELL AS YOU CAN PEOPLE HERE TODAY. WHEN I JUST ADDRESS- THE ISSUE IS IF THIS IS FAKE NEWS OR NOT. I THINK IN A HUNDRED YEARS WE'RE GONNA LOOK BACK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN UKRAINE THERE WILL BE SOME FOLKS IT WILL SAY- THERE WASN'T A MASSACRE. IN UKRAINE. IT'S EASY TO DO A CENTURY LATER. BUT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WRONGED ARE SITTING IN THIS HEARING ROOM RIGHT NOW THANK BE REALLY CANDID IT IS EMBARRASSING TO HEAR FOLKS COME IN AND TRY TO DEFEND THE NAME. OF THIS INSTITUTION. IT'S REALLY UPSETTING TO ME. IT'S EASY FOR US TO OUR ANGLO AMERICANS TO STAND UP AND SPEAK ABOUT THE SO CALLED INNOCENCE OF MISTER HASTINGS LEVINE INNOCENT ABOUT IT THIS NAME CHANGE SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED YEARS AGO. AND I THINK WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE FACTS HERE TODAY AND THE FACTS ARE. BOTH THE YOU KEEP PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE OF AROUND L. INDIAN TRIBES. THEY WERE MASSACRED LET'S CALL IT WHAT IT IS- GENOCIDE. AND WE SIT HERE EVERY NIGHT LOOKING AT WHAT'S HAPPENING UKRAINE AND THERE'S GENOCIDE HAPPENING THERE AND THAT HAPPENED IN THE STATE. I HAVE BEEN HERE STATE AND WAS. OUR GOVERNMENT THAT DID IT. SO NOW WE'RE CENTURY LATER WE'RE GONNA SAY IT WASN'T HIM BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY THE STATE THAT ALLOWED. I'M SORRY I JUST CANNOT BELIEVE THAT INDIVIDUALS WOULD COME UP AND SUPPORT THAT. VIEW KANDYANS WERE MASSACRED. AND I AGREE THAT THE HASTINGS NAME SHOULD FOREVER BE STRIPPED FROM THE BUILDING. SCOURGE ON OUR HISTORY. BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT THE PEOPLE FIRST. ARE IN THE PEOPLE OF THE ROUND ALLEY INDIAN TRIBES IN THE U. K. PEOPLE DESERVE BETTER FROM THE STATE. SO DO ALL THE OTHER NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES IN CALIFORNIA THROUGHOUT THE WEST. THE ONLY WAY THAT WE COME TO TERMSTHE ONLY WAY THAT WE COME TO TERMS WITH THE ATROCITIES OF THE PAST IS BY SHAPING A BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR THE NATIVE PEOPLE IN THE STATE IN THE FUTURE. THERE IS A REASON WHY NATIVE CHILDREN HAVE THE HIGHEST ACES SCORES IN THE STATE. WHY SOME OF THE HIGHEST POVERTY RATES IN THE STATE PER CAPITA EXIST ON NATIVE AMERICAN RESERVATIONS. WHY THERE IS MORE FIT NO USE IN DRUG USE AND ALCOHOL USE WITHIN THE TRIBES OF CALIFORNIANS COMMUNITY IT IS BECAUSE IT IS BECAUSE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THIS PAST IN THE PAST. WITH THESE PEOPLE. SO HERE'S MY BOTTOM LINE IN THIS LEGISLATION. I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH WHERE CENTER AMBERG IN CENTER WIENER AND A MAJORITY LEADER EMERITUS HERTZBERG WANT TO GO ON THIS AND I SUPPORT IT. BUT I ALSO DON'T WANT TO LOSE SIGHT ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO WE NEED TO FOCUS IN ON. THIS IS MUCH MORE THAN A NAME CHANGE. THIS IS ABOUT LIFTING UP THE PEOPLE OF AROUND ALLEY INDIAN TRIBES IN THE U. K. PEOPLE. THIS LEGISLATION MUST BE SPECIFIC ABOUT THE PROGRAMS SERVICES AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT IT WILL PROVIDE. FOR THOSE NATIVE RESIDENTS. I'M SORRY- MANAGER I DON'T USUALLY GET HOT AROUND THE COLLAR- BUT IT IS VERY PERSONAL FOR ME AND I SEE DAY IN AND DAY OUT WERE PRESENT RUSS IS FOCUSING ON HIS TRIED AND HOW HE'S TRYING. TO WORK FOR A BETTER LIFE FOR HIS FOLKS AND IF IT'S ALRIGHT TO THE CHAIR I JUST LIKE TO ASK PRESENT REST A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RIGHT MANAGER ABSOLUTELY YOUR DISCRETION. MMHM THE REST AS YOU COME UP A QUESTION THAT I HAVE. IS IN YOUR FULL DISCLOSURE THE PRESENT I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE HAVE CONVERSATIONS. BUT I THINK THAT WHERE YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO GO WITH HIS LEGISLATION ALSO KNOWN AS ASSEMBLY BILL. MOVING FORWARD BUT IT'S ABOUT PROGRAMS IT'S ABOUT SERVICES. IT'S ABOUT EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES IN THE FUTURE IT'S ABOUT THE PEOPLE. OF THE TRIBE PLEASE I DON'T WANT TO PUT WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH- YES SIR THAT'S WHAT I WAS IN AND JUST. TAKE A MOMENT TO EXPLAIN ALL AGO. WAS THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING SOME VERY GOOD DISCUSSIONS. I A WITH THEM IN FACT WHEN I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO THANK HIM AND HIS STAFF. AND ALL THE ALL THE FOLKS THAT ARE INVOLVED. AND SO WE'VE BEEN HAVING SOME GOOD DISCUSSIONS ON WHAT WE'RE CALLING THE INITIATIVES FOR RESTORATIVE JUSTICE. AND THOSE OF A VERY FRUITFUL DISCUSSIONS WE HAVE ONE ANOTHER ONE PLANNED THIS AFTERNOON. TO COME TO THE TABLE AND DISCUSS THESE ISSUES. SO I THINK THAT ARE UP MARK ARE OPPOSITION AS THE TRIBAL COUNCIL. TO THE BILL WAS THAT THAT WASN'T INCLUDED. BUT THEN WE JUST HEAR THESE GENTLEMEN THAT HAVE COLLECTED THE BILL THIS MORNING- TESTIFYING THAT THE ANOTHER. FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES THEY WANT TO INCLUDE THOSE. RESTORATIVE JUSTICE YOU. SO I TOTALLY SUPPORT THAT. AND THEY WANT TO SIT DOWN AT THE TABLE WITH US AND WE'RE MORE THAN WILLING TO DO THAT. SO I THINK WE COULD BE MOVED FORWARD IN A POSITIVE MANNER AND WE COULD HAVE SOME FRUITFUL DISCUSSIONS ON THIS. I CAN SEE THAT HAPPENING ALREADY. NO I THINK YOU SO MUCH. MISTER PRESIDENT I THINK THAT- INVOLVING- MISTER AMBERG MISTER WIENER IN MISTER HERTZBERG ALONG WITH MISTER AHMOSE IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT AS WE MOVE FORWARD CORRECT. I AGREE. HUH 100% IN MISTER PRESIDENT ANY OTHER ITEM THAT YOU. I MAY NEGLECT TO- MENTION YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE OUT OF. WITH I JUST WANTED TO REALLY REACH OUT TO- AND MENTION THAT- THE ASTINGS- STAFF HAS BEEN FOR A FRUITFUL AND VERY FORWARD INCOMING WITH THESE ISSUES. TO THE TRIED THEY'VE BEEN AROUND VALLEY WE'VE TALKED TO THEM THEY'VE INVITED THE YOU COMMITTEE DONNA SUMMER CISCO. NOW WITH THEM LATER THAN BY THE TRIBAL COUNCIL TO COME DOWN. SO WE HAVE HAD SOME GOOD DISCUSSIONS AND THEY'VE BEEN FOOT VERY FORWARD INCOMING WITH THE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE ISSUES. AND IDENTIFYING THOSE ISSUES WITH US AND NOW WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE JUST GOING THROUGH A KIND OF- REFINING THOSE ISSUES AND- MAKING THEM SO THAT THEIR- DOABLE. AND THAT WE'RE IN AGREEMENT ON THEM SO I THINK THE PROCESS HAS STARTED WITH- AND I WITH. SOMEONE RAMOS BUT I THINK IT'LL CONTINUE WITH THE GENTLEMAN WITH THIS BILL. I THINK IT'S MUCH SIMPLER BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO THE AMENDMENTS TO BE PUT TO THIS BILL THAT'S WHAT WE POST WAS THAT THE THOSE WERE INCLUDED IN THERE. IN THE FIRST PLACE. BUT I THINK WE'RE ALL IN AGREEMENT ON STRIKING OF THE NAME. SO A HUNDRED PERCENT. VERY GOOD. I THINK IN A FINISH UP AND JUST SAY AGAIN IS PRESENT THANK YOU SO MUCH- AND TO ALL WHO TRAVELED. FAR AND WIDE TO BE ABLE TO BE HERE IN THE CAPITAL TODAY VERY GRATEFUL. NOW SOMEONE AYE AYE TAKE MOM TO BE ABLE TO KNOWLEDGE CENTER NUMBERS AND WIENER ANSWER HERTZBERG FOR THEIR COMMITMENT TO THIS TRULY- INSURER FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO BE ABL TO. ENGAGE GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT ABLE TO GET THIS DONE- AND I KNOW THAT YOU ARE HERE TODAY AND YOU HAVE ALREADY SAID YOU'RE COMMITTED TO THAT I LOOK FOR TO PARTICIPATE IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS. AND I JUST WANT TO SAY HOW GRATEFUL I AM FOR AT THIS EFFORT. AND MANAGER I APPRECIATE THE POINT PERSON FOR THE G. PROVIDING TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER MCGUIRE AND I MISTER PRESIDENT I ALSO JUST WANTED TO SAY. I WAS VERY HAPPY TO HEAR THAT THE- AUTHORS OF THE BILL ARE GONNA BE WORKING ON RESTORATIVE JUSTICE BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT THAT WAS NOT FORMALLY INCLUDED IN THE BILL SO. BEEN A POSITIVE DAY SO FAR. ALL RIGHT WE'RE GONNA GO TO CENTER GLAZER. THANK YOU A MAN ZERO I APPRECIATE. CENTER MAGUIRE'S ENGAGEMENT WITH THE PRESIDENT TO HAVE FROM AROUND VALLEY I WAS GOING TO ALSO. HAVE SOME QUESTIONS I THINK THEY WERE COVERED BY THAT I WANT TO GIVEN pIN OUR HEARING TODAY. I'M I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THESE. TYPES OF DISCUSSIONS- AT THE FIRST BILL THAT I INTRODUCED IN THE LEGISLATURE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. WAS A BILL TO REMOVE THE NAME OF CONFEDERATE LEADERS FROM OUR PUBLIC BUILDINGS HERE IN CALIFORNIA- FOR THE SAME REASONS THAT I THINK THIS. DEBATE AND DISCUSSIONS ARE. ARE CONTINUING BECAUSE THE- YOU KNOW WE WANT THERE TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PEOPLE. AND WE WANT- NAMES TO REFLECT PLACES OF HONOR. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE AUTHORS ARE TRYING TO ADVANCE WITH THIS BILL I AM. AND THEN BY THE WAY BECAUSE IT WAS REFERENCE TO THE STATE SANCTIONING OF THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY ABSOLUTE THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY WHAT'S- AND- OUR FIRST GOVERNOR GOVERNOR BURNETT ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN AN EXTERMINATION ACTIVITIES IN OUR STATE. FIRST GOVERNOR AND- IF YOU GO TO THE CAPITOL TODAY. YOU WILL SEE HIS PORTRAIT IN A PLACE OF HONOR. AND I WOULD CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE- A REVIEW OF THAT- SITUATION. I HAD MINIMUM- BUT I AT MATTERS LIKE THIS I DEFER TO THE COLLEGE I THINK THEY'VE GOT ENGAGED IN A THOUGHTFUL PROCESS. TO COME TO GRIPS WITH THAT THE HISTORY AND ALL OF THAT I THINK THAT THE BILL TODAY DOESN'T SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS WOULD CERTAINLY ELIMINATE SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS CLEARLY- IT NEEDS TO BE DONE. AND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT I THINK THIS ACCOUNTABILITY IS A HEALTHY THING IT TAKES A LOT OF COMMITTEE TIME AND ALL THE REST BUT I ENCOURAGE IT IN EVERY LEVEL OF PUBLIC LIFE THAT- THAT YOUR HISTORY WILL BE REVIEWED IT'S NOT. A ONE TIME THING WHEN YOU'RE POPULAR AND ALL AND ALL THAT AND I HOPE WE CAN CONTINUE TO DO THAT KIND OF EXAMINATION. THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER CENTER PAM. THANK YOU AND I OF WANT JUST APPRECIATE THE- REMARKS AND QUESTIONS OF MUCH OF THE SENATE MCGUIRE AND THE CENTER OF GLACIER- YEAH I HEARD THE COMMITMENT FROM THE AUTHORS TO WORK WITH THE TRIBES AND ADDRESSING THOSE PARTICULAR ISSUES- AND- SO THAT'S MY HOPE TO SEE HAPPEN- AS- THE BILL MOVES ALONG AND FORGET TO THE FLOOR- SO WITH THAT- I. WILL BE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND THE WILL MOVE THE BILL APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU SENATOR PAN CENTER CORTESE. HEY JUST OVER KIND OF A TECHNICAL QUESTION AND I'M- OF A LIMIT MISSY EXPLANATION SOMEHOW IN THE PRESENTATION BUT- IN STRIKING. HE SEEMS AND LEAVING COLLEGE OF THE LAW- IT SEEMS LIKE COLUSA SUPPORT THE BILL WERE NOT TO BE FURTHER AMENDED THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S WALKING INTO THAT LAW I UNDERSTAND OF COURSE EVERYTHING ELSE HE SAID ABOUT- YOU SEE IN THE BOARD AND OTHER PEOPLE PARTICIPATING IN THIS DISCUSSION AND I JUST HEARD THE TESTIMONY. DOES UP WITH THAT THEN WE- IS THE PRESUMPTION THAT THAT THAT'LL BE OF FURTHER NAME CHANGE AMENDED IN OR THAT THIS NAME CAN STAY THE WAY IT IS WITHOUT IMPACTING- WOULD YOU SEE WILL LATER RECOMMEND. SO A COUPLE THANK YOU FOR RAISING THE QUESTION NUMBER NUMBER ONE NUMBER NUMBER TWO IS THAT- BY STRIKING NAME HASTINGS. THE LIKELY DEFAULT POSITION WOULD BE UC COLLEGE OF LAW UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA COLLEGE OF LAW WE REALIZE THAT THAT IT DOESN'T COMPLETELY NAME THE SCHOOL AND THAT WILL BE OF FURTHER PROBABLY. A DENOMINATION INSERTING NAMED ST LOUIS THIS IS MY THOUGHT NAZARIAN NAME SAN FRANCISCO OMEWHERE IN THAT COLLECTION OF WORDS- BUT IT'S NOT FINALIZED YET. HELLO AS- I WILL THERE ARE- AS THERE ALWAYS IS WITH ANYTHING YOU SEE- THERE'S SORT OF AN ODDITY HERE THAT THE LOGIC DOESN'T. YOU SEE IS CONSTITUTIONALLY SEMI AUTONOMOUS AND WITH TYPICALLY NAME ITSELF- BUT THIS IS A HUNDRED FIFTY YEAR OLD STATUTE ANSWER UC HASTINGS HAS BEEN. IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE RETURNS WITH THE UC R. P.TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS ON THE SAME PAGE WITH UCSF- AND SO- THAT OUR MEDICAL SCHOOL- AND SO- YEAH AND BUT IT'LL BE. A BROADER CONVERT CONVERSATION. THROUGH CHARMING THING I'M ASKING THIS AND I THINK THIS GOES TO THE LAST OPPOSITION THAT WE HEARD. NOTHING IN THIS BILL TODAY AS IT MOVES OUT OF COMMITTEE PREJUDICES THE FOR THE- NAMING OF THE SCHOOL THAT'S CORRECT THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER CORTESE UP BEFORE WE GO TO YOUR CLOSE I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL BEFORE US TODAY. AS A DISASSOCIATE SERRANO'S HASTINGS FROM CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PUBLIC LAW COLLEGE THE BILL'S CONSISTENT WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECISION TO CALL INTO QUESTION THE LEGACY OF THE COLLEGE'S NAME SAKE BASED ON HASTINGS. INVOLVEMENT IN THE-MASS KILLINGS OF NATIVE AMERICANS IN CALIFORNIA'S EVEN AND RAN BALLETS IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES IT MATTERS VERY MUCH IT MATTERS WHO PUBLIC COLLEGES HONOR IT IS A STATEMENT OF AN INSTITUTION'S VALUES. AND BY EXTENSION THAT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RENAMING HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO IN PARTICULAR FOR NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS FACULTY AND COMMUNITY. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE COMPETING OPINIONS ABOUT WHAT THE NEW NAME SHOULD BE AND WHAT THE NEW RENAMING PROCESS SHOULD INVOLVE. MOVING FORWARD I WOULD STRONGLY ENCOURAGE ALL AUTHORS OF THE BILL TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH COLLEGE LEADERSHIP ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS WHO INTRODUCED A BILL ON THE SAME SUBJECT. AND THE ROUND VALLEY INDIAN TRIBAL COUNCIL AND YOU KEY INDIAN COMMITTEE ON THE APPROPRIATE NEXT STEPS FOR RENAMING THE COLLEGE WITH THAT YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR LIVE LET ME BEGIN BY THANKING PRESIDENT RUSS- PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE ATROCITIES COMMITTED UPON HIS PEOPLE THAT DOUBT WE MET WITH HIM THE THREE OF US MET WITH HIM IN HIS- OPEN HEART AND OPEN MIND. WITH RESPECT TO HOW WE CAN WILL NEVER GOING TO RIGHT THIS WRONG WE'RE NEVER GOING TO RIGHT THIS WRONG BUT BUT HOW WE CAN. BATES BASICALLY MAKE SURE THAT. ONE THE PEOPLE ARE EDUCATED TO THAT WE DO WHAT WHAT WE CAN TO PROVIDE SOME- RESTORATIVE JUSTICE FOR THOSE WHO WERE THE ANCESTORS. OF OF THOSE WHO'VE BEEN AFFLICTED I WANT ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS WITH WITH CENTER MCGUIRE THANK YOU SENATE MCGUIRE FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE- AND THEN A COUPLE RESPONSES ONE. ONE OF THE FOLKS OPPOSITION AS YOU CAN SEE THIS IS NOT. A UNIVERSAL OPINION THE NAME HE'S THING SHOULD COME OFF IT IS OUR VIEW ARE VERY STRONG VIEW- THAT IT SHOULD COME OFF BUT AGAIN. NOT UNANIMOUS. OF. EDUCATION FOUND THAT HASTINGS WAS NOT INVOLVED THESE ATROCITIES. THAT IS TRUE THAT WAS INVESTIGATION IS DONE EIGHTEEN SIXTY AND IS A FURTHER EMBARRASSMENT TO US. THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD ABSOLVE HIM WHERE THE HISTORIC RECORD IS I THINK COMPLETE AND REPLETE. WITH THE EVIDENCE OF HASTINGS PARTICIPATION THESE ATROCITIES- SECONDLY IN TERMS OF THE HASTINGS DESCENDANTS I'M INFORMED THAT COLONEL CLAUS. LEYVA HELP WHO IS THE DESCENDANT OF SERENA'S HASTINGS WHO DOES SIT ON THE BOARD. SUPPORTS THE REMOVAL OF THE NAME HASTINGS. AND THUS TO THE EXTENT THAT ANYBODY HAS ANY EQUITY IN THAT NAME. THIS PERSON COLONEL LEHMAN HOW HIS AGREED THAT NAME SHOULD COME OFF AND WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I WANT TO THANK THE JOINT AUTHORS THERE'S ACTUALLY BEEN A LOT OF EFFORT PUT IN THIS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO ADDITIONAL EFFORT BEING PUT AN- ORIGINAL VOTE. THANK YOU SIR I'M BURKE THANK YOU FOR THOSE CLARIFICATIONS THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR PAN. MADAM CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL FILE ITEM NUMBER TWO S. B. TWELVE EIGHTY EIGHT. THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS LEYVA HI. LEYVA OHIO TO A VOTE. THE TROUBLED BY PARTISI. PRETEND THE I. DALI. AYE GLAZER AYE GLAZER AYE MCGUIRE. MCGUIRE AYE PAN. ALL RIGHT. HI THANK YOU GENTLEMEN THAT BILL IS OUT TO YOUR- ALL RIGHT MEMBERS WE ARE NOW GOING TO MOVE TO FILE SEVEN SENATOR CORTEZ. PRISON SB. THIRTY FORTY ONE. BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY SENATOR. OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS TODAY I'M HERE 2% SB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE OF THE CALIFORNIA SORE AS IN S. O. A. R. GUARANTEED INCOME PROGRAM THOUSAND STUDENTS. WITHIN CALIFORNIA'S K. TWELVE SCHOOL SYSTEM ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS RIGHT RIGHT NOW- OF THAT NUMBER A NUMBER THAT HAS INCREASED BY OVER 40% THE PAST DECADE ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND. OUR CURRENT HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS SCHOOL DISTRICTS SUPPORT THE STUDENTS BY UTILIZING FUNDS FROM THE MCKINNEY VENTO ACT A KEY FEDERAL LEGISLATIVE SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THE ACT WAS INTENDED TO BE A FIRST STEP TOWARD RESOLVING HOMELESSNESS. HOWEVER IN THE ABSENCE OF LEGISLATION. BUT CONTINUING TO FURTHER UP MEASURES FOR REACHING MEASURES HOMELESSNESS CAN ONLY BE EXPECTED TO INCREASE AMONGST THIS POPULATION. THE LAW ONLY APPLIES TO CURRENTLY ENROLLED STUDENTS MEANING A STUDENT% EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WILL ONLY RECEIVE SUPPORT UP UNTIL THEY GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL. THE LACK OF SUPPORT AVAILABLE TO YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS POST GRADUATION SIGNIFICANTLY HINDERS OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE THEIR EDUCATION OR CAREER AMBITIONS. WELL FEDERAL AND STATE LAW PROVIDE EXTENSIVE FINANCIAL AID TO YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WHO INTEND TO ENROLL IN COLLEGE THAT HE DOES NOT BECOME AVAILABLE UNTIL THE STUDENT BEGINS ATTENDING COLLEGE IN THE FALL. AS A RESULT MANY OF THESE YOU'VE BECOME SUBJECT TO A PHENOMENA KNOWN AS SUMMER MELT. THE SCENARIO WHICH THE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE. IS ACCEPTED INTO COLLEGE INTENDS TO ENROLL IT'LL COMMITTEE DOES NOT. THIS PROBLEM IS COMMON AMONG LOW INCOME STUDENTS WHO LACK THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO MAKE THE TRANSITION FROM HIGH SCHOOL TO COLLEGE IN THE FALL. THESE STUDENTS OFTEN BECOME STICKER SHOCK. WHEN THEY LEARNED. OF THE FEES ASSOCIATED WITH TEN COLLEGE- IN THAT THEY MUST BE PAID BEFORE THE THEIR FINANCIAL AID KICKS IN. SUCH AS THEIR SUMMER ORIENTATION FEE HOUSING DEPOSIT PARKING PASS AND SO ON IN RECOGNITION OF THE NEED TO EXTEND SUPPORT TO OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS DURING THE BRIDGE BETWEEN HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION AND POST SECONDARY EDUCATION. OR EMPLOYMENT SB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE ESTABLISHES A STATEWIDE GUARANTEED INCOME PROGRAM THAT WILL PROVIDE DIRECT CASH ASSISTANCE ON A MONTHLY BASIS TO THESE YOUTH. THE BILL DEFINES INDULGENT A ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANT UP FIRST AS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS ENROLLED IN THE TWELFTH GRADE SECONDLY MISTER DEFINITION OF HOMELESSNESS ACCORDING TO THE MCCAIN OF ANTI ACT. IN THIRD OF WAS COMPLETED A FAST SO OR CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT APPLICATION AS PART OF IN ROMAN. THE PROGRAM WILL SERVE APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN THOUSAND YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS STATEWIDE BEGINNING ON APRIL FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TREE THROUGH AUGUST FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO FIVE. PAYMENTS ARE CONTEMPLATED THE BILL DIRECTS THE ADMINISTRATOR CAN TO CONDUCT AN EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM TO LEARN. HOW THIS FORMA SUPPORT MAY ASSIST YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN EXITING THE CYCLE CYCLE OF PROPERTY AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS. ABOUT THE BILL- IS IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISRUPT THE CYCLE OF HOMELESSNESS- IN REGENERATE- AT THIS GREAT AT THIS AGE AT THE TWELFTH GRADE. OF THE NO STRINGS ATTACHED GUARANTEED INCOME MODEL EMPOWER THESE USED TO USE THE FUNDS AS THEY SEE FIT. WHETHER THAT BE ENTERING INTO THE WORK FORCE ULTIMATELY ARE PURSUING HIGHER EDUCATION. SB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE WILL EQUIP YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WITH THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO EMBARK ON A PATH. TOWARD STABILITY AND SUCCESS. I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT YOU'RE IN THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING. WITH ME AND MY STAFF ON THIS BILL. I DON'T WHICH THAT WE DO NOT YET HAVE AN ADMINISTRATOR NAME FOR THE PROGRAM A COMMITTEE WORKING WITH THE CHAIR. A TO DETERMINE WHO WOULD BE THE BEST FIT. OF IN PAST RECENT INVESTMENTS BY THIS LEGISLATURE IN- A GENERAL- IN GUARANTEED INCOME PROGRAMS. A DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES WAS DETERMINED TO BE THE RIGHT FIT- IN DISCUSSIONS WE'VE HAD. INTERNALLY AND WITH COLLEAGUES WERE NOT CLEAR- THAT THAT'S THE BEST FIT FOR THIS PROGRAM. BUT THERE ARE OPTIONS WITH THAT SAID I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVALS THANK YOU CENTER CORTESE YOU HAVE TO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT BOTH HAVE CALLED IN WE HAVE CRISTINA TORRES YOU'VE ADVOCATE FROM THE JOHN BURTON ADVOCATES FOR YOUTH.

EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS FOR AT LEAST ONE NIGHT PER YEAR WITH 40% OF THE STUDENTS PRUDENT SECURE. SENATE BILL THIRTEEN FORTY ONE A GUARANTEED INCOME PILOT PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS ENTERING COLLEGE WITH MUCH NEEDED SUPPORT ALL WITHOUT IMPACTING THE FINANCIAL ISSUE FINANCIAL AID. SB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE DIRECT CASH PAYMENT OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER MONTH FOR HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS WHO ARE HOUSING INSECURE. WILL HELP THEM MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS IS A TRANSITION FROM HIGH SCHOOL TO HIRE AND- EMPLOYMENT.

THANK YOU ANSWER CORTESE I DO APPRECIATE THE THAT WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED IN THIS BILL I GUESS THE- MOUSE'S POINTS OUT I THINK TO SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT SOME OF THE DETAILS ON IMPLEMENTATION- I GUESS FOR EXAMPLE- ARE WE- THE STUDENTS ARE RECEIVING THESE FUNDS ARE WE GOING TO HELP THEM GET BANKED- ARE. YOU WITH ME TO GIVE THE MONEY SO THEY NEED TO KEEP IT SOMEWHERE RIGHT AND THEN PERHAPS SOME FINANCIAL EDUCATION THAT GOES WITH. UNDERSTANDING WHAT NEEDS TO BE BANKED AND NOT UNBANKED AND- HOW TO USE YOUR MONEY AND SO FORTH- SO MAYBE CAN SPIEGEL TO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. THE WHAT YOU'RE THINKING IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION- SO THE GOOD NEWS IS IT IS NEW IS A GUARANTEED INCOME INCOME PROGRAMS TEND TO BE WE HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE WITH STANDING THEM UP IN CARE COOLEY LAST YEAR'S THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR EFFORT RALPH FOSTER PREGNANT WOMEN IN- DEBIT CARDS HAVE BEEN USED- THUS FAR LOCALLY WITH LOCAL PROGRAMS IN BETTER CITIES- THAT'S WHERE THE STATE'S BEEN HIDDEN TO AVOID THE- THE COMPLICATIONS OF ISSUING CHECKS- PEOPLE HAVING OPEN UP BANK ACCOUNTS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THEM AND SO FORTH- ONE OF THE THINGS I DON'T WANT TO GET. OFF TOPIC VERY CLOSELY RELATED IS THAT- WRITTEN INTO THE LEGISLATION- YOU COULD ACTUALLY SEE IT ON PAGE FOUR- IS SO SOMEONE WAS AT THE MINISTER MAKES UP IN KIND CONTRIBUTIONS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO FIND OUT TO MAKE AN INITIAL MENTORSHIP SERVICE FOR PARTICIPANTS WHICH WE FOUND IN. OTHER PROGRAMS LOCAL AND STATE IS- GENERALLY FORTHCOMING AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE- BANKING INSTITUTIONS CREDIT UNIONS AND SO FORTH. THE SAID SHE WANTED TO PROVIDE OR OFFER THOSE SERVICES FREE WITHOUT MANDATING THE STUDENTS TO DO THAT WHICH- KIND OF GETS IN THE WAY OF. THE GUARANTEED INCOME APPROACH BUT MAKING IT AVAILABLE AND IN SOME. SUBSCRIBE TO IT- WHICH WHICH AND CAN ALSO HELP. YOU KNOW JUST WITH THE- SORT OF THE SMOOTHNESS OF MAKING SURE THAT THEY RECOGNIZE- WIN MONEY- IS AVAILABLE TO THEM AND WHAT THEY CAN DO WITH IN TERMS OF BANK IT. MIGHT AS WELL AS IS WAS NOT MAKING MISTAKES IN TERMS OF THEIR DECISIONS AND CHOICES SPENT. I APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK YOU KNOW YES- IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION RIGHT- SOMEONE TAT IS HOMELESS- ALSO DAY DON'T HAVE- WELL YOU LOSING STRAIGHT THINGS AND IF YOU HAVE A PERMANENT. PLACE AT CETERA AND- THERE'S OTHER FACTORS AS WELL WHICH- THE CHECKOUT SO IT'S CERTAINLY A SUPPORT YOUR BILL I WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT- I HAVE HAPPENED TO BE ON HUMAN SERVICES I GUESS I GET ANOTHER BITE AT THE APPLE AND SEE HOW IT'S OF ALSO ON THE RISE AND HUMAN SERVICES CELL- SO BUT I'D- BE HELPFUL TO SORT OF. GET SOME OF THESE DETAILS AND AFTER YOU'RE TALKING A LOT OF PEOPLE'S WELL. WORKED OUT- IT'S THE BILL VOLS AND- SO WITH THAT. WOULD BE VOTING FOR THE BILL TODAY LOOK FORWARD TO ITS FURTHER EVOLUTION TERMS AND IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT THE PURPOSE OF THE L. THAT THE GENERAL IDEA OF THE BILL. AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO MOVE TO BUILD THE PERFECT TIME THANK YOU CENTER PAN ANY FURTHER. QUESTIONS OR VIA CENTER DOLLY. THANK YOU SENATOR I NOTICED- THE BILL. WOULD REQUIRE THAT INDIVIDUALS EITHER COMPLETE FASTER OR THE DREAM ACT APPLICATION BEFORE. THEY CAN BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS FUNDING BUT I WAS UNABLE TO FIND. A REQUIREMENT. THAT THEY HAVE TO EITHER BE ACCEPTING OR PLANNING TO ATTEND COLLEGE IN THE FALL. IS IT YOUR INTENT. THAT THIS MONEY. SHOULD BE USED TO HELP THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE TO WILL BE ATTENDING COLLEGE IN THE FALL OR WOULD THE FUNNY BE AVAILABLE FOR SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO GO STRAIGHT INTO THE WORKFORCE- BOTH. BOTH AND SO THE STAFF SAYS NOW ALMOST UNIVERSALLY- TAKEN OUT BY. RISING FRESHMAN OR EXITING- SENIORS IN CALIFORNIA DUE TO PRIOR- ACTS OF THE STATE- SO WE'RE JUST. TIED TOGETHER IN THIS ENROLLMENT PROCESS THE FILLING OUT OF THAT FORM SO THAT THEY ARE READY FOR WHAT I HOPE WOULD BE THE VAST MAJORITY WHO ARE GOING ON TO POST SECONDARY EDUCATION HOWEVER THEY'RE GOING TO PUNISH PRESSURE PROGRAM AT THE PREPARE THEMSELVES FOR- YOU KNOW CAREER TECH OPPORTUNITIES- WORK THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE GOING DIRECTLY INTO SOME WORKFORCE OPPORTUNITY. OF LIKE ONE OF OUR ENERGY COMPANIES IS OFFERING FOR EXAMPLE SILICON VALLEY RIGHT NOW WHICH TAKES HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS AND PUTS THEM RIGHT INTO- HI LIVING WAGE PAYING JOBS- THE WORKING IN THE ENERGY SECTOR THAT'S FINE TOO. I WAS USING THAT AS AN EXAMPLE ONLY IN HERE BUT- THE ANSWER IS BOTH IN. SO IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE GOING STRAIGHT IN THE WORK FORCE WITHOUT GOING TO LIKE A CAREER TRAINING OR- ON THE JOB TRAINING WHICH YOU'RE GETTING PAID WHEN YOU. TYPICAL THOSE CORPORATIONS ARE ON THE JOB TRAINING AT PAID AT THE SAME TIME. SO I GUESS I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF YOU IF YOU'RE NOT ON TRACK TO GRADUATE ARE YOU STILL. AVAILABLE TO RECEIVE THE FUNDS. IF YOU'RE A LOT OF TROUBLES SURGERY ARE YOU COULD BE AT A GRADE LEVEL BUT NOT BE ON TRACK TO. ACTUALLY GRADUATE DUE TO A CURRICULA THAT THE BILL IS INTENDED TO BE- FOR GRADUATING SENIORS. GRADUATING SENIORS OF FOR THAT PERIOD OF TIME BETWEEN SENIOR GRADUATION AND WHEN COLLEGE WOULD COMMENCE HOWEVER THERE AND IT DOES NOT MANDATE THEM TO ENROLL IN COLLEGE SO IT'S IF I MAY IF I MAY TRY TO PUT THE LENS ON IT THIS WAY IT'S FIRST AND FOREMOST OF A STUDENT HOMELESSNESS BILL AS STUDENT HOMELESSNESS AS DEFINED IN IN- BASED ON ON THE DATE OF THE MCKINNEY VENTO ACT AND THEN OBVIOUSLY SECONDARILY AS I DISCUSSED IN MY PRESENTATION- TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO DO INTEND TO ENROLL- IN IN COLLEGE WERE CAREER ACTIVITIES. DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS ARE SUPPORTED DURING THAT TIME IT HOPEFULLY GETTING THEMSELVES OUT OF HOMELESSNESS. THANK YOU CENTER DOLLY ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CENTER PANDER TO MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU CENTER CORTESE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE.

A CRISTINA TOWARDS- I THINK- SELF IDENTIFIED- WITH THE WHO IS A YOUTH ADVOCATE WITH THE JOHN BURTON ADVOCATES FOR YOUTH IN A CURRENT STUDENT AT BAKERSFIELD CLIMATE SO I JUST BE ABLE TO DO WHAT I USUALLY DO IT.

AND THANK YOU TO ALL OUR WITNESSES THAT CALLED IN TODAY WILL NOW BE BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TERM. TO HAVE A TO ANY BERMAN HAVE ANY OR COMMENTS. REYES THANK YOU WILL FIRST THAT- I UP AND SHE THE GRAY GOALS THAT THIS BILL ADVANCE CIVIC EDUCATION OVER IMPORTANT AND THE MAIL THANK SUIT LEADERS WHO HAVE JOY IN OUR TODAY BECAUSE THEY HAVE EXAM. SAID UP A. ONE- IT SEEMS WHAT WE WANT AND I APPRECIATE THEIR AND IN THE ISSUE AND THEIR PET TO. TODAY I HAVE TO SAY THAT I AM STRUGGLING WITH THIS BILL. DESPITE THE GREAT VALUES AND GOALS BECAUSE- IT SEEMS TO OPEN A PANDORA'S- AND I'LL TO GIVE THE IDEA THEY WANT AUTHOR IT'S TO MAKE ADDRESS. SOME OF CAN- FOR- WE CAN'T REGULATE SPEECH. AND SO STUDENTS WHO DECIDE TO LEAVE SCHOOL FOR- THE PURPOSE OF- ENGAGING AND- THIS KEPT THE CIVIC ACTIVITY COULD DO IT FOR EVEN EXTREMIST GROUPS SOME GROUPS THAT THAT ADVANCE HATE- AND SO THAT CERTAINLY. GIVES US SOME PAUSE ALTHOUGH WE APPRECIATE THE RIGHTS OF ALL PEOPLE TO. EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS. THE SECOND ISSUE IS THAT- WE SEEM TO BE STRUGGLING TO GET STUDENTS TO BE IN THE CLASSROOM. BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE- STUDIES THAT ARE TAKING PLACE- THE I DON'T RECALL OFF HAND HOW MANY. SCHOOL DAYS ARE YOU CURRENTLY REQUIRED TODAY AND HOW THAT HAS CHANGED OVER TIME. I KNOW THAT WE ARE ALL WORRIED ABOUT LEARNING LOSSES WE HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC AND- AND WE DO SEE DECLINING TEST SCORES. SO WE KNOW THAT THE WORK OF OUR- OF OUR SCHOOL COMMUNITY IS- STILL WE STILL HAVE TO DO A LOT MORE THAT SPACE AND A PART OF THAT IS- STUDENTS BEING IN THE CLASSROOM TO BE PART OF THAT LEARNING PROCESS I WANT TO GIVE THE AUTHOR A CHANCE TO. ADDRESS THIS TO WORRIES THEY THINK VERY MUCH CENTER GLAZER SO ON YOUR FIRST QUESTION THAT'S WHAT WE STRUGGLE WITH RIGHT IS IF WE GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE IN THEIR CIVIC RIGHTS. WE CAN'T I WOULD NOT WANT TO SEE US. DISSUADE OR ELIMINATE THOSE WHO ARE. IN MY OPINION LEGEND LEGITIMATELY PARK PER TO A PARTICIPATING IN CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. BECAUSE WE HAVE A MINORITY OF PEOPLE THAT MIGHT WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN SOME NEGATIVE. HATE SPEECH TYPE- EVENT SO I THINK THAT THE GOOD OUTWEIGHS THE BAD- AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ALSO A WAY TO LEGISLATE- OF FOR US TO SUBJECTIVELY SAY. WHAT IS A GOOD EVENT AND WHAT IS A NOT A NOT A GOOD EVENT. I THINK THAT CIVIC ENGAGEMENT IS IMPORTANT ENOUGH THAT WE TAKE THAT CHANCE SECONDLY- YES WE DO ON OUR STUDENTS IN CLASS AND WE DO WANT THEM LEARNING ALL THE IMPORTANT CURRICULUM. BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY AS A MOTHER OF TWO ADULT DAUGHTERS SOME OF THE BEST THINGS THEY LEARNED WERE DAYS WHEN THEY GOT TO PARTICIPATE. IN AN ACTIVITY OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL THINGS THAT STAYED WITH THEM FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES AND THINGS THAT ENCOURAGE THEM. TO TO JUST BE A PART OF OUR SOCIETY AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY VOTED ENGAGE CIVICALLY. YOU ALL KNOW THAT I WAS PART OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT AND THEIR MANY TIMES WHEN MY DAUGHTERS WERE. THERE PARTICIPATING IN MANY DIFFERENT THINGS AND THEIR LIFELONG LESSONS SO I THINK THAT THIS ONE DAY FOR CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. OUTWEIGHS ANYTHING THAT COULD BE CONSTRUED AS A PROBLEM THANK YOU THANK THANK YOU FOR THAT AND AGAIN I SHARE-THE SENTIMENTS THAT YOU HAVE WHEN YOU DO ENGAGE IN THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY IT'S REALLY CEMENTS THEIR APPRECIATION FOR OUR- WONDERFUL GOVERNMENT LIKE- SO WE DO HAVE SEX EDUCATION IN SCHOOL. AND I KNOW THAT I REMEMBER MIND WHERE THEY HAD A SAID YOU NEED TO ENGAGE IN CERTAIN S. CIVIC ACTIVITIES UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THAT THE TEACHER. AND I CERTAINLY AS A LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIAL LITTLE I SEE THAT STUDENTS COMMAND- TO TEST AT OUR CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS TO FOR PHYLLIS CIVICS EDUCATION REQUIREMENT. OF TESTIFYING OR PARTICIPATING OR WRITING A PAPER SO WE DO KNOW THAT- OUR OUR SCHOOL LEADERS. EMBRACE THAT GOALS OF THIS BILL IT BUT THEY DO IT IN A MORE ORGANIZED FASHION AND I GUESS THAT'S THE THING ME PAUSE ON THE LOWER. BEFORE US IS THAT. I THINK I'D PREFER TO DEFERRED THAT LOCAL LEADERSHIP. ADVANCING THE IMPORTANT VALUES THAT YOUR BILL EXPOSITOR APPRECIATE YOU BRING IT FORWARD ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK THAT IS. THAT IS AGAIN A CONUNDRUM BECAUSE NOT EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT AND NOT EVERY SCHOOL HAS A ROBUST CIVICS CLASS. I CAN TELL YOU THAT MY DAUGHTERS DID NOT GET A ROBUST CIVICS CLASS WHEN THEY WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL SO THIS IS A WAY OF MAKING SURE. STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE WILL HAVE ACCESS TO SOME OF THESE- CIVIC ENGAGEMENT OPPORTUNITIES- I WOULD LOVE NOTHING MORE THAN TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY SINGLE. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM- HAS A ROBUST CIVICS CLASS BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET SO THIS IS A SMALL STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS. FIFTY NINE GUESS I ROLES SOME OF MY- MY COMMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS AND CONCERNS- I THINK AS AS SENATOR GLAZERS SURE I ALSO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE BELL- IN THAT ONE. I UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE- OUR CLASSES ARE GOVERNMENT CLASSES THROUGHOUT DIFFERENT GRADES- THAT ARE ACTUALLY THAT ACTUALLY GIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS TO BE ENGAGE YOUR WATCH AND LIKE YOURSELF I WATCHED MANY OF OUR LOCAL STUDENTS ACTUALLY ENGAGE IN PROTEST AS WELL AS ATTEND LOCAL- GOVERNMENT PROCEEDINGS- OR VISIT JUST THE CITY HALL SO STARTING FROM ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ALL THE WAY UP TO HIGH SCHOOL SO WE HAVE- YOU KNOW AS PART OF THE CURRICULUM. THAT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES FOR GOVERNMENT ENGAGEMENT TO OBSERVE HOW GOVERNMENT WORKS AND WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE ENGAGED IN THAT AND I THINK THE CONCERN THAT I PERSONALLY HAD WITH THAT IS THAT ALTHOUGH THE BILL STATES THAT IT'S FOR ONE DAY AND OF COURSE I SHARED. I'M NOT GOING TO ECHO THE AB NOT GONNA REPEAT THE THAT COMES OVER ME EARLIER BUT IT WAS IT THERE IS A- A LINE HERE THAT I ACTUALLY WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT AND THAT WAS WITH REGARDS TO YOU- LINE. TWENTY THREE THAT STATES- THE- ALTHOUGH IT'S FOR ONE. DAY FOR THE PER OF A HIGH MIDDLE SCHOOL MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL PEOPLE ENGAGING IN CYNICAL CIVIC OR POLITICAL EVENT. AND THAT RIGHT THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A CONCERN FOR ME THE POLITICAL PART. AS PROVIDED IN SUBPARAGRAPH AND THEN IT GOES ON TO SAY THAT- IS REQUIRED TO BE EXCUSE FOR ONLY ONE SCHOOL DAY LONG ABSENCE PER SCHOOL YEAR. BUT ON THE FOLLOWING LINE IT SAYS THE MIDDLES- I'M JUST GOING TO. SUMMARIZE YOUR BODIES AS MAY BE PERMITTED ADDITIONAL EXCUSE EXCUSED ABSENCES IN THE DISCRETION OF THE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR- AND NOT ACTUALLY TO ME WITH A LITTLE BIT OF A CONCERN BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THE BILL SPECIFIES ONE DAY. IT DOES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME AND IN THE FIRST PART OF BILLBOARDS AS A POLITICAL EVENT IT MAKES ME A LITTLE NERVOUS THAT WE WOULD USE THIS AS A LOOPHOLE. TO HAVE OUR CHILDREN. BEING GAUGE POLITICALLY FOR POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME- YOU KNOW WHAT EVERYBODY I MEAN AT THE DISCRETION OF THE OF THE OF THE OF THE LOCAL. SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR AND I THINK FOR ME OVERALL. ONE THING IS TO BE AB THE HOBBIT OPPORTUNITY THROUGH. THE SCHOOL TO BE ENGAGED IN GOVERNMENT AND HOW THE GOVERNMENT PROCESS WORK IN A DIFFERENT STORY FOR ME PERSONALLY IN THE POLITICAL CAMPAIGN ARENA. AND THE REASON I SAY THAT IS THAT I CAME INTO THIS SPACE OUT FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME. AND IT WAS AN EYE OPENER AND- IT WAS AN EYE OPENER BECAUSE I REALIZE HOW TOXIC. OF AN ENVIRONMENT IT COULD POTENTIALLY BE. AND THERE'S A LOT OF- THERE'S A LOT OF AB NEFARIOUS ACTORS IN THE SPACE WHERE THEY SHARE A LOT OF FALSE INFORMATION AND- AND- I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT A LOT OF FALSE INFORMATION THAT CAN BE INCREDIBLY MEAN AND VERY HURTFUL. AND OUR STUDENTS WHICH- DON'T HAVE THE LIFE EXPERIENCES YET TO HELP IN THEIR DEVELOPING OUT THERE IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THAT I'M AFRAID THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE EXPOSED AND THIS IS JUST ME BEING PROTECTED HERE- BUT EXPOSED TO IT TO A SPACE WHERE POTENTIALLY COULD BE VERY HARMFUL AND- I THINK THERE'S A REASON WHY WE HAVE A VOTING YOU KNOW AGES OF EIGHTEEN OVERCOME THE POLITICAL PART ON THAT END AND ONE THING IS BEING INVOLVED WITH YOUR PARENTS AND SO FORTH AND ANOTHER ONE IS THE SCHOOL ALLOWING OUR STUDENTS TO BE EXPOSED TO AN AREA POTENTIALLY BEING IN AN AREA. WHERE THEY CAN BE USED FOR POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS I'M IN UNDERSTANDING HOW THAT ENVIRONMENT CAN CAN EVOLVE IN IN CERTAIN AREAS IT JUST MAKES ME A BIT NERVOUS TO FOR THAT BUT FOR GOVERNMENT YOU KNOW- ENDEAVORS HOW GOVERNMENT WORKS TO ME THERE'S A CERTAIN LEVEL OF- PROTECTION IN THAT SPACE VERSUS LEAVING IT OPEN FOR A SPECIFICALLY WHAT IT SAYS HERE POLITICAL EVENTS AND THEN. EVEN IT OPEN ONCE AGAIN TO YOU I. EXCUSED ABSENCES IN THE DISCRETION OF THE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR AND IF THERE IS- AFFILIATIONS WITH A SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR WITH THE LOCAL I. CANDIDATE IN A LOCAL PART IN GRANITE. FOR ME THIS WOULD BE FABULOUS BECAUSE I'M VERY ENGAGE WITH MY AT MY LOCAL SCHOOLS AND I HAVE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS SO. I YOU KNOW. PASSING THIS WOULD BE A GREAT EXPERIENCE FOR ME. BUT I'M LOOKING AT AREAS WHERE IT MAY NOT BE SO- POSITIVE ERROR OR MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE CONTENTIOUS. AND- AND THAT ACTUALLY IT'S ALL GIVEN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THAT BUT THAT IS THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE RIGHT NOW THAT IT WOULD IT COULD POTENTIALLY BE EXPLOITED. FOR CAMPAIGN PURPOSES FOR PERSONAL BENEFIT OF LOCAL- CANDIDATES AND- ELECTED'S. SALATA IMPACT THEIR SENATOR CHOI BOGUE BUT LET ME I'LL GIVE IT MY BEST SHOT. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT- TO YOUR POINT SENATOR GLAZERS PONTS ABOUT US SCHOOLS ALREADY DOING THIS I WILL GO BACK TO WHAT I pDOING THAT AND IF YOU BOTH ARE IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE DOING THAT THAT'S WONDERFUL. BUT IT'S NOT HAPPENING EVERYWHERE UP AND DOWN THE STATE SO THIS BILL IS A SMALL ATTEMPT TO HELP THAT HAPPEN SECONDLY I WOULD SAY WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT. POLITICS IS A PART OF GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT DOESN'T HAPPEN IF POLITICAL PARTIES DON'T ELECT PEOPLE WE WOULDN'T HAVE SCHOOL BOARDS WE WOULDN'T HAVE CITY COUNCILS IF THOSE FOLKSWERE NOT ELECTED WE WOULDN'T HAVE A STATE GOVERNMENT. IF THOSE FOLKS WERE NOT ELECTED SO POLITICS IS. THE REASON WE ARE HERE AND HAVE A GOVERNMENT. DO I THINK THE PEOPLE COULD BE EXPLOITED PEOPLE COULD BE EXPLOITED ON ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS- AND I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT'S A REASON TO NOT MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD. THIS IS ABOUT ATTEMPTING TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND HOW GOVERNMENT WORKS AND TO UNDERSTAND AND IT MAY BE A POLITICAL THEY MAY GO TO A POLITICAL EVENT THEY MAY NOT THEY MAY GO TO A SCHOOL BOARD MEETING THEY MAY GO TO A CITY COUNCIL MEETING. THEY MAY FLY UP HERE AND PARTICIPATE IN ONE OF OUR HEARINGS THERE ARE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT THEY COULD PARTICIPATE IN- THERE WAS ONE OTHER THING YOU SAID THEY WANT TO ADDRESS BUT IS ESCAPING ME- AS- THE BILL. IS FOR ONE DAY ONE DAY OF EXCUSED ABSENCE THE PORTION YOU'RE READING. AT THE SCHOOL CAN ALWAYS ALLOW STUDENTS TO BE GONE LONGER- WHEN MY DAUGHTERS WERE IN GRAMMAR SCHOOL ONE OF THEM WHAT CUT EXCUSE FOR TWO WEEKS FROM THE SCHOOL. TO TRAVEL TO- HOLLAND WITH MY HUSBAND BECAUSE WE FELT THAT HER EXPERIENCE IN HOLLAND FOR TWO WEEKS WAS GOING TO BE. I HATE TO SAY THIS UP MORE LIFE CHANGING A BENEFICIAL THEN THE TWO WEEKS YOU WOULD HAVE SPENT IN FOURTH GRADE. SO THAT IS ALWAYS BEEN THERE AND THAT WOULD BE UP TO THE DISCRETION OF THE SCHOOL THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THAT THIS BILL. ALLOWS FOR ONE DAY FOR A CIVICS ENGAGEMENT. I GUESS TO THAT I WOULD SAY BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THE CIVIC PART OF IT AND HOW. THAT LINE BUT THE FACT THAT IT. CREATES THE POLITICAL EVENT PART. THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME NERVOUS THAT'S INCLUDED IN THAT WITH THAT WITH THAT IT IS BECAUSE AS I EXPLAINED WITHOUT POLITICS. WE DON'T HAVE CIVICS AND WE DON'T HAVE GOVERNMENT WHETHER WE LIKE OUR POLITICAL PROCESS OR NOT. IT IS JUST THIS IS HOW WE GET GOVERNMENT. I AGREE I AGREE ON THAT AND THAT'S WHY I ACTUALLY. THROUGHOUT MY DISTRICT WHEN I SPEAK TO GROUPS I. TRY TO ENGAGE OUR PEOPLE AND UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS SO I. I GET THAT PART OF. BEING ENGAGED IN BEING INFORMED- BUT JUST AS A MINOR YOU KNOW THERE'S A REASON WHY WE HAVE MINORS IN LAWS PROTECTING OUR MINERS AND SO I JUST. THAT'S JUST THE ONLY. LITTLE RESERVATION THAT I HAVE READ YOUR- SENATOR PAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CEREBELLAR- SO FIRST OF ALL I GO TO PUT THE BILL TO LIGHT KEEP TO KEEP WORKING ON IT AT THE MET. I AM- I DO SHARE SOME THE SAME. THAT CENTER BOGUS SIX INTO OF. YES POLITICS IS PARTICLE I MEAN WE AREN'T THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE RIGHT NOW WE GOT DOUBTS. AND- MY CHILDREN HAVE BEEN TO POLITICAL EVENTS- BUT I THINK INTO OF IT BEING A- EXPLICIT REASON FOR EXCUSE SCHOOL. WELL THERE MAY BE SOME CERTAINLY SOME CONCERNS OF IT BEING ABUSED ARE- PLACE THEY'D BE USED TO IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW PUTTING. PERHAPS OF THE SCHOOL. WHOEVER ELSE'S ACCEPTING THAT AS AN EXCUSE IN AN AWKWARD POSITION- AS WELL- AND SO- I DO ADMIT I SHARED SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS I HOPE YOU'LL- ADDRESS THOSE AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD- BECAUSE THIS IS I MEAN THIS IS FOR AND I IT CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WE SAID YOU KNOW NOT ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS DO THIS. RIGHT- BUT TO CERTAIN EXTENT WE DO NEED SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO PROVIDE SOME STRUCTURE AND- AND PROTECTION AROUND THE STUDENTS SO THAT. IT'S TRULY AN EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE- CERTAINLY YOU KNOW WHAT GIVE THE LATITUDE TO PARENTS AS WELL WHO WHO CHOSE TO THE ONSET THAT I'M GONNA TAKE MY CHILD OUT OF SCHOOL FOR THE DAY. AT I THINK THAT'S AND IT IS ONLY FOR YOUR POINT ABOUT WILL FOR MORE DAYS THEY DO YOU KNOW THEY HAVE DISCUSSION ETCETERA. IHAVE BEEN AND I HAVE SOME ANXIETY IS A WITHOUT THE POLITICS PART ABOUT THE VULNERABILITY AND ALSO AND FOR SCHOOL PERSONNEL EVEN IN TERMS OF POTENTIALLY BEING CAUGHT IN A AND A CHALLENGING SITUATION- AT A- PARTICULAR POLITICAL SITUATION. OF- IN TERMS OF- THE USE OF STUDENT TIME SO- BUT I CERTAINLY WANT YOU KNOW THAT- WHAT YOU TO MOVE MARTIN THE BILL FOR I THINK THAT THIS IS A- AT YAHOO. SUPPORT NOT TO. HAVE STILL HAVE THAT HAVE HAVE THAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE AND YOU KNOW SO. REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE VERSUS JUST IN AND- VERSES JUST PERHAPS EIGHT BILL IN THE- IN THE TEACHING ENVIRONMENT SOMETHING- BUT- I DO I CAN. I DO SOME OF THE CAN THAT WERE EXPRESSED THANK YOU IT TO BE CLEAR SCHOOLS CANSINO. SELF YOU KNOW OR PARENTS CAN SAY NO PARENTS CAN YOU KNOW AS PARENTS WE HAVE A LOT OF. A LOT OF CONTROL THAT SOMETIMES IS AN EXERCISE BUT THIS ISN'T ABOUT JUST- YOU KNOW ME NOT GOING TO SCHOOL AND SAYING HEY I'M GOING TO GO DO THIS OR THAT AND I'M GONNA GET EXCUSE FOR THE DAY. PARENTS WOULD HAVE TO ALLOW THEIR CHILDREN IN THE SCHOOL WOULD HAVE TO APPROVE IT AS WELL. SO THERE THERE ARE GUARDRAILS. YOU HAVE SEEN. THANK YOU AND I WANT TO THE BECAUSE HAVE A DOLLARS TO SEE. THIS IS AN ANSWERS- WOULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN SOME FOLKS PRICIEST TAXING FROM TIME TO TIME HERE BUT WE'RE OFTENTIMES GETTING SOMETHING THAT ME FROM MY STAFF- IN THIS CASE MY DISTRICT OFFICE WAS TEXTING ME BECAUSE- FOR NINETEEN YEARS PREVIOUS TO THE PANDEMIC I'VE BEEN BRINGING UP- A SO CALLED BUS TRIP TO SACRAMENTO- WITH- AS MANY AS FIVE TOUR BUSES FOR FOLKS TO COME UP AND MEET. LEGISLATORS SO LIKE MEMBERS OF THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE AND SO FORTH- TO TALK TO FAMILIES- LOCAL CONSTITUENTS IN CHILDREN- SCHOOL AGE pUNDER THE BANNER OF- IN THIS CASE- PLEASE GIVE REVIEWS ON EDUCATION FUNDING THE IRISH OF THE TRIP IF THEY'RE ALWAYS WAS ONE IS OVER THOSE NINETEEN YEARS AND BY THE WAY IT'S COMING BACK THIS YEAR BUT I WAN TO THE SHAMELESS PLUG WHAT YOU'LL KNOW. SEVERAL OTHER- BUT- HE KNOW THE MAY READ WHEN WE'RE ALL- GETTING A HANDLE ON THE BUDGET BUT THERE'S SORT OF AN IRONY IN IT IS THAT PEOPLE START ASKING AS JUST HAPPENED ON A TEXT MESSAGE HERE WHILE WE WERE HERE IN THIS BILL IS IT OKAY TO BRING CHILDREN YOU KNOW- CAN I BRING MY CHILDREN FROM SCHOOL OF COURSE THAT'S A PARENTAL DECISION FIRST AND FOREMOST BUT IF THEY DO IT WITHOUT- A CREDIT ARRANGEMENT WITH THE SCHOOL THEN WE'RE PULLING ADL SCHOOL WE BROUGHT AS MANY AS A HUNDRED FIFTY YOUTH APPEAR. IN THIS A HUNDRED FIFTY USE TIMES OF EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH MEANS WHAT WE'RE FIGHTING. THE OF US WHO CHOOSE THAT. FOR EQUITY IN IN A- FUND- WERE. IN A VERTICALLY CREATING A PRO HERE SO I REALLY. THAT BECAUSE GOT TO BE HAPPY AND DOWN STATE IN MANY MAY DIFFERENT WAYS WITH. FOLKS WANTING TO BRING YOU TO THE TOWN HALL MEETINGS AND SO FORTH WE ALREADY HAVE STATE STATUTE THAT SAYS A GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES WHICH ARE PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE CANNOT ENGAGE IN PARTISAN. POLITICAL ACTIVITY LIKE CAMPAIGNS- I'M NOT SURE YOU KNOW IF TO BUILD COMMITTEE WANTS TO CALL THAT OUT OR NOT IT'S I DON'T BECAUSE MY- MY PLAY I HEAR THE CONCERN SO THAT. I KNOW IN MY EXPERIENCE- ON. THAT SIDE OF THE POLITICAL ACTIVITY- WHEN WE- WANT TO ENGAGE YOUNG PEOPLE IN IT IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM. IN ACTUAL CAMPAIGN ACTIVITY. MOST CERTAINLY IT'S ALWAYS BEEN REQUIRED THAT THE STUDENTS ARE. INSTRUCTED THAT- THEY CAN OPT IN OR OPT OUT ANY- CAMPAIGN OR POLITICAL ACTIVITY OF THEIR CHOICE NOT. SIMPLY THE ONE THAT HAPPENS TO BE THE IMITATION BEFORE THEM BUT- YOU KNOW IT DOES SEEM TO ME ALREADY EXISTED IN STATE LAW BUT IF THEY NEED TO BE. CROSS REFERENCE SOMEHOW IN THE BUILDING MAYBE THAT MAKES PEOPLE FEEL A LITTLE BIT MORE COMFORTABLE I CERTAINLY FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE BILL THE WAY IT IS AND IT'LL BE SUPPORTING THE- THANK YOU. THEN THANK YOU. FOR RECALLING ONLY. I'M SURE YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS WHAT WE'RE FOR IS TO HAVE THE- ROBUST DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE- AND BRING IDEA THAT WE MAY. ALL HAVE- AT THE TIME OF READING THE BILL- DO YOU FOLKS HAVE ANY. ELSE YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAY WELL I'M LET ME JUST GO OUT. AT LET ME JUST. MAKE MY FINAL. AS I SAID- I THINK. I THINK THE PERSONALLY JUST THE ONLY CONCERN I HAVE IS THE POLITICAL CAMPAIGN ASPECT OF IT. AND I DO BELIEVE THAT WHEN IT COMES TO POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS YOU CAN DO THAT AFTER SCHOOL YOU HOW WE CAN EXPECT THE WEEKEND STIFF YOU CAN ATTEND THOSE TYPE OF EVENTS. DURING SCHOOL WE HAVE GOVERNMENT'S CLASSES IN GOVERNMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND I KNOW THAT. WHEN THERE'S BEEN A OPPORTUNITIES TO. ENGAGE IN SOMETHING SPECIFICALLY. OUT OUR SCHOOL WAS ALWAYS VERY JUST RESPECTIVE ARE- RESPECTFUL AND ACCOMMODATING IN IN TRYING TO. GIVE THE STUDENTS THAT THE RESPONSE THE EXPERIENCES I THINK LOCAL CONTROL IS VERY IMPORTANT IF LOCAL SCHOOLS ARE NOT BEING ENGAGED. AND I SURELY HOPE THAT THE LOCAL CITIZENS WILL. ADVOCATE FOR THAT IN THEIR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. ON ON THAT AND- SO. BECAUSE EVEN IF WE MANDATED IT UNLESS THE OPPORTUNITY DISCOUNT IN THERE PROMOTED BY THE LOCAL. EITHERTEACHERS OR PARENTS THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE UTILIZED- ITER SO. IN SUCH YOU'RE NOT IN SUCH A THIS BEING THINK WITH WHAT WE HAVE IN PLACE. IT CAN ALREADY HAPPEN- SO THAT'S THE ONLY BECAUSE THAT THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT I THAT I HAVE TO SAY. IT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE WOULD LOVE TO CLOSE THANK YOU. MADAM A CO CHAIR. SO YES IT CAN HAPPEN. AND YES IF WE PUT THIS IN STATUTE IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT EVERYONE WILL AUTOMATICALLY DO IT BUT WHAT IT DOES DO. IS IT MAKES STUDENTS AWARE OF IT SO IF LOCALLY THE SCHOOL BOARD IS NOT ENGAGING IF CITIZENS ARE NOT ENGAGING. STUDENTS NOW KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THIS RIGHT SO THEY CAN ASK TO BE EXCUSED THEY CAN SAY SOMETHING TO THEIR MOM AND DAD SAY HEY I WANT TO BE A PART OF THIS. SO PART OF THIS IS MAKING SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND AND THIS WILL BE A LAW. THAT IS OUT THERE FOR THEM TO SEE AND PARTICIPATE IN. I WOULD ALSO MENTION I SHOULD'VE MENTIONED EARLIER WE HAVE A YOUNG SENATORS PROGRAM WE'VE HAD IT FOR THE EIGHT YEARS I'VE BEEN IN THE SENATE. IT IS- HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND WE BRING THEM UP HERE AS WELL EVERY YEAR WE HAVE AN UNFORTUNATE US TWO YEARS BECAUSE OF COBIT. BUT WE PUT THEM ON A BUS AND WE BRING THEM UP HERE SO THAT THEY CAN SEE. THEIR CAR. WERE SO THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS IN A LOT OF. FOR US TO HELP OUR STUDENTS BE CIVICALLY ENGAGED. TO HOPEFULLY BE BETTER ADULTS- AND BE MORE ENGAGED AS ADULTS. THIS BILL IS ONE SMALL PIECE OF THAT I RESPECTFULLY HOUSE FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SENATOR LEYVA AND THE RECOMMENDATION IS DUE PASSED BUT FIRST. BE RE. BE RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE AND APPROPRIATIONS- WE HAVE A MOTION. SIR MOVED BY SENATOR MCGUIRE. THANK YOU. FILE ITEM NUMBER EIGHT S. B.

A GOOD MORNING AGAIN MEMBERS IT IS GREAT TO BE WITH YOU ALL. I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS OUTLINED ON PAGE EIGHT OF THE ANALYSIS. THIS AMENDMENT WILL INCLUDE- EDUCATORS AND EDUCATOR BARGAINING REPRESENTATIVES. TO THE CD AND CD S. S. COUNCIL. SB NINE SEVENTY SIX PROVIDES UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL BY ENSURING THAT PARENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA HAVE INCREASED OPTIONS. WHEN IT COMES TO CHILD CARE. CLEARLY ACCESS TO CHILD CARE IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT SO THAT PARENTS CAN WORK AND PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. SB NINE SEVEN SIX CREATES A FREE UNIVERSAL PRE SCHOOL SYSTEM BY EXPANDING ACCESS. TO THE STATE'S PRESCHOOL PROGRAM TO ALL THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLD. REGARDLESS OF FAMILY INCOME. THE BILL SUPPLEMENTS THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN BY STRICT STRENGTHENING OUR CHILD CARE INFRASTRUCTURE. MEMBERS THE COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC PUSHED OUR CHILD CARE SYSTEM. TO THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE. MANY PROVIDERS 98% OF MORE WOMEN WERE FORCED TO CLOSE OR SIGNIFICANTLY LIMIT THEIR ENROLLMENT DURING THE PANDEMIC. CHILD CARE GROUPS IN CALIFORNIA RELY ON SERVING. A RANGE OF AGE GROUPS GIVEN THE HIGH COST OF INFANT AND TODDLER CARE. AS YOU MAY KNOW THIS IS AN INDUSTRY THAT EMPLOYS WOMEN OF COLOR PRIMARILY. WE MUST CREATE A SYSTEM THAT NOT ONLY WORKS FOR FAMILIES BUT ALSO UP LIVES AND PROVIDES. UPLIFT PROVIDERS BY ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY. TO OPEN THE DOORS TO MORE. CHILDREN AND PAY THEIR EMPLOYEES A LIVING WAGE. SB NINE SEVEN SIX STRENGTHENS CHILD CARE IN CALIFORNIA. AND PROVIDES FAMILY WITH MUCH THE FAMILIES WITH MUCH NEEDED FLEXIBILITY. AS WELL AS OFFER STABILITY TO THE CHILD CARE COMMUNITY. WITH ME IN PERSON TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT IS DONIS GARINGER WITH THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER. AND JUSTIN BLAKELY FROM CRYSTAL STAIRS WILL BE JOINING VIA TELECONFERENCE LINE. TO SPEAK AND SUPPORT MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK. YOUR AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU WILL WITH. IN PERSON WITNESS. DONE WOULD YOU LIKE TO. WITH THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM MEMBERS AND SENATOR LEYVA FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THIS BILL. MY NAME'S DONNA SNARE DRUM THE VICE PRESIDENT CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER FOR THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER. WE'RE A NONPROFIT CHILD AND FAMILY DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION BASED IN BOTH SAMPOERNA DINO AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AND OUR MISSION IS TO CULTIVATE CHILD FAMILY AND COMMUNITY WELLBEING WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT ACCESS AT EQUITABLE ACCESS TO A DIVERSE ARRAY OF PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS IS CRITICAL. FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR FAMILIES AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE PROUD CO SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. ACROSS THE UNITED STATES THERE'S BEEN A DECADES LONG PROGRESSION TO OFFERING PRESCHOOL SERVICES MORE BROADLY. MANY STATES HAVE IMPLEMENTED THESE MODELS WITH VARYING DEGREES OF SUCCESS AND THERE ARE MANY LESSONS LEARNED. CALIFORNIA HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN FROM THESE OTHER EFFORTS ONE THING IS CLEAR UTILIZATION OF A MIXED DELIVERY MODEL WHICH ENGAGES AND BUILDS UPON OUR EXISTING PROGRAMS INCENTERS. FAMILY CHILD CARE HOMES AND HEAD START. IS CRITICAL TO THE OVERALL SUCCESS OF NOTONLY OUR PRESCHOOL EFFORTS. BUT OUR OVERALL SYSTEM OF CHILD CARE FOR ALL CHILDREN BIRTH THROUGH TWELVE. AND THEIR WORKING PARENTS. IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. THE CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS RELEASED A REPORT OUTLINING SIX KEY COMPONENTS FOR A PRESCHOOL PROGRAM THAT WOULD SUPPORT A STRONG EQUITABLE BIRTH THROUGH AGE FIVE SYSTEM THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE DESIGNING A SYSTEM FOR PRESCHOOL TO BE DELIVERED IN MULTIPLE SETTINGS INCLUDING FAMILY CHILD CARE SUPPORT HEAD START TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND TO SERVE MORE PRESCHOOLERS AND THEIR FAMILIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. INVEST IN INFANTS AND TODDLERS IT EXCLUDING THEM FROM INCREASE FUNDING WOULD UNDERMINE OUR OVERALL SYSTEM ENSURE EQUITABLE ACCESS AND QUALITY BY DIRECTING STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PLAN TO SERVE TARGETED. AREAS IN GROUPS OF STUDENTS PRIORITIZE PROVIDING EQUITABLE COMPENSATION TO EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION EDUCATORS REGARDLESS OF SETTING AND LASTLY ENSURE THAT ALL PROGRAMS PROVIDE A PLATFORM THAT VALUES FAMILY VOICE AND SHARES POWER WITH FAMILIES. WE ARE JUST ABOUT TWO MINUTES WOULD YOU MIND WILL GO QUICK. FOR CALIFORNIA TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN DELIVERING UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL WHILE NOT HARMING THE FULL SYSTEM OF CARE WHICH SUPPORTS CHILDREN FAMILIES OUR STATE'S ECONOMY IT'S CRITICAL WE ENGAGE THE FULL FIELD. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO CALIFORNIA TOOK A STEP FORWARD WITH UNIVERSAL PRIEST TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN WE BELIEVE SB NINE SEVEN SIX WILL TAKE THE LESSONS. FROM THAT AND BUILD UPON IT TO CREATE THE FOUNDATION FOR MIX DELIVERY COMPONENT OF UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL THE TABLE FOR KEY STAKEHOLDERS ENSURING THE ENGAGEMENT OF ALL TYPES OF PROVIDERS TO MEET THE AGE AND DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS OF OUR CHILDREN. AND ADDRESS THE BROAD SCOPE OF NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN A VARIETY OF SETTINGS THAT ARE VERY BIG AND DIVERSE STATE.
