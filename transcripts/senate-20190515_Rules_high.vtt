PROGRAMS NOW THAT THERE REALLY

00:05:35.334 --> 00:05:37.537
FOCUSING ON CHANGING THINKING

00:05:37.603 --> 00:05:41.374

ONE OF THE PROGRAMS NOW THAT

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:43.710
SOME BASED ON COGNITIVE

00:05:43.776 --> 00:05:46.679
BEHAVIORAL -- THERAPIES IS --

00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:47.914
BUT THE LONG TERM OFFENDER

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.549
PROGRAM AND MANY OF THOSE

00:05:49.615 --> 00:05:52.351
PROGRAMS THEY HAVE A CRIMINAL

00:05:52.418 --> 00:05:54.620
THINKING WHICH REALLY GETS TO

REALLY START TO WORK ON CHANGING

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:04.230

ABOUT THE STRUCTURED DECISION

00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:54.300

ACTUALLY HOW IT IS -- IT IS USED

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:05.645
IN THE HEARING PROCESS THE LA A

00:09:05.711 --> 00:09:07.947
WILL RAISE SOME ISSUES ABOUT.

00:09:08.014 --> 00:09:09.215
THE FUNDING OF THAT BASED ON

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:10.449
THEM NOT HAVING THAT MUCH

OUR CONVERSATION SO.

00:09:14.553 --> 00:09:15.788
I HEARING A WITH ALSO A MOMENT

00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:17.123
HERE I THINK I'LL BE VERY

00:09:17.189 --> 00:09:19.892
HELPFUL FOR ME HOW IT'S APPLIED.

00:09:19.959 --> 00:09:21.894
THE IT'S A START MOST PEOPLE

00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:23.262
WHEN THEY THINK OF THE STRUCTURE

00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:25.331
DECISION MAKING TOOL I THINK OF

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:27.934
AS ALGORITHM AS FAR AS HAVING US

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.436
DETERMINE IF GRANT WITH THE

00:09:30.503 --> 00:09:31.737
REDEPLOYMENT GRANT THE INMATE.

00:09:31.804 --> 00:09:33.539
OR WE'RE GOING TO KEEP HIM IN

00:09:33.606 --> 00:09:34.407
PRISON.

00:09:34.473 --> 00:09:35.641
IT'S NOT LIKE THE A SIMPLY AS A

00:09:35.708 --> 00:09:37.276
TOOL TO HELP THE DEPUTY

00:09:37.343 --> 00:09:37.777
COMMISSION COMMISSIONER

00:09:37.843 --> 00:09:39.111
CALLEGARI. TO COME TO A

00:09:39.178 --> 00:09:41.380
CONCLUSION AS FAR AS WATER RISK

00:09:41.447 --> 00:09:42.848
FACTORS AND WHAT ARE THE AT THE

00:09:42.915 --> 00:09:43.916
ISSUES THAT WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED

00:09:43.983 --> 00:09:46.352
ON NOT SIMPLY TALKING ABOUT THE

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:47.320
LIFE.

00:09:47.386 --> 00:09:48.788
STATIC BUT ACTUALLY FOCUSING ON

00:09:48.854 --> 00:09:50.690
WHEN THE RISK TO THIS PARTICULAR

00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:51.958
INMATE.

00:09:52.024 --> 00:09:54.393
AND TO FOCUS THE HEARING UPON TO

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.562
FIFTY THAT AND NOT THE ACTUAL BY

00:09:56.629 --> 00:09:58.164
CRIME ITSELF BUT FOCUSED ONE OF

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:08.574
INTERCHANGE THEY HAVE TO

00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:10.910
DEFENDER ACTUALLY CHANGED.

00:10:10.977 --> 00:10:13.546
SO WE END AND SOLD THE TOOL THAT

00:10:13.612 --> 00:10:15.181
WE USE HAS -- NUMEROUS DOMAINS

00:10:15.247 --> 00:10:17.483
AND IN EACH ONE OF THOSE BILLS

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:18.684
DOMAIN WEEK THOSE TO ME AS WE GO

00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:19.285
THROUGH.

00:10:19.352 --> 00:10:20.586
EACH ONE AND WE'RE REALLY

00:10:20.653 --> 00:10:21.487
LOOKING AT RISK FOR RE OFFENSE

00:10:21.554 --> 00:10:22.555
BASED ON RESEARCH.

00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:25.524
AND SO WE GO THROUGH EACH DOMAIN

00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:27.727
AND AT THE END OF THE DOMAINS

00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:28.794
MAY SAY LIKE FOR EXAMPLE

00:10:28.861 --> 00:10:30.596
CRIMINAL HISTORY -- THIS INMATE

00:10:30.663 --> 00:10:31.263
MIGHT HAVE HAD AN EXTENSIVE

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:31.931
CRIMINAL HISTORY WITH THEIR

00:10:31.998 --> 00:10:34.066
CRIMES BEING VERY CLOSE IN --

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:35.134
PROXIMITY THERE YOU KNOW ONE

00:10:35.201 --> 00:10:36.502
RIGHT AFTER ANOTHER WE MAY SAY

00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:37.937
THAT'S AGGRAVATED AND WE GO

00:10:38.004 --> 00:10:38.537
THROUGH THE DOMAINS AND THEN

00:10:38.604 --> 00:10:40.606
BASED ON THAT INFORMATION.

00:10:40.673 --> 00:10:42.308
THEN WE WE WE KNOW OKAY AT THE

00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:43.442
VERY BEGINNING OF HIS LIFE THIS

00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:44.710
IS WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH HIM.

00:10:44.777 --> 00:10:46.412
WERE WERE NOW TWENTY FIVE YEARS

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:48.748
LATER -- HAS THERE BEEN CHANGE

00:10:48.814 --> 00:10:50.616
AND WE REALLY FOCUS ON THE

00:10:50.683 --> 00:10:53.919
CHANGE WE STILL HAVE DISCRETION.

00:10:53.986 --> 00:10:56.389
ON IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THIS CHECK

00:10:56.455 --> 00:10:58.057
SYSTEM IMMUNE YOU KNOW NUMBERS

00:10:58.124 --> 00:10:59.925
AND THEN THIS EQUALS THAT IT IS

00:10:59.992 --> 00:11:02.261
FOCUSED ON THESE ARE THE HIGHEST

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:04.063
RISK FACTORS FOR THIS INMATE AND

AND IF HE HAS HE WE'VE BEEN MAKE

00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:09.702
SOME DETERMINATIONS BASED ON

00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:11.237
SOME CONVERSATION EVIDENCE IN

00:11:11.303 --> 00:11:12.671

00:13:20.366 --> 00:13:21.600
PROGRAMS AVAILABLE FROM.

00:13:21.667 --> 00:13:22.902
MAYBE A LOT OF PROGRAMS TO MAYBE

00:13:22.968 --> 00:13:24.069
NOT SO MANY AND I FOUND YOUR

00:13:24.136 --> 00:13:25.404
RESPONSE TO THAT QUESTION IF IF

00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:26.105
YOU COULD SHARE.

00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:27.273
WHAT ROLE YOU THINK THAT PLAYS

00:13:27.339 --> 00:13:29.642
AND HOW THAT AFFECTS WERE NOT?

00:13:29.708 --> 00:13:32.244
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR DURING A

00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:33.812
PAROLE HEARING?

00:13:33.879 --> 00:13:34.880
AND SO I I'VE BEEN PROGRAMMING

00:13:34.947 --> 00:13:36.081
IS REALLY IMPORTANT BUT

00:13:36.148 --> 00:13:37.316
SOMETIMES PROGRAMMING IS NOT

00:13:37.383 --> 00:13:38.317
AVAILABLE.

00:13:38.384 --> 00:13:40.953
AND THERE ARE MEN AND WOMEN WHO

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:46.358
REALLY TAKE THE INITIATIVE.

00:13:46.425 --> 00:13:47.593
TO IDENTIFY WHAT SEEMS NEEDED TO

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.029
CHANGE AND THE DO SELF STUDY

00:13:50.095 --> 00:13:51.096
THEY GO TO THE LIBRARY THEY

00:13:51.163 --> 00:13:53.933
REALLY -- GET INTO INFORMATION

00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:55.801
THAT REALLY ASSIST THEM IN IN IN

00:13:55.868 --> 00:13:57.503
THEIR CHANGING SO THEY MAY NOT

00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:59.004
BE IN A FORMALIZED PROGRAM THEY

00:13:59.071 --> 00:14:00.773
MAY START A PROGRAM.

00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:02.174
ON THERE'S IN BUILDING --

00:14:02.241 --> 00:14:03.842
PROGRAMS THAT INMATES START IN

00:14:03.909 --> 00:14:05.611
WHICH THEY MAY NOT BE A

00:14:05.678 --> 00:14:07.379
AVAILABLE BUT THEY KNOW THE

00:14:07.446 --> 00:14:08.247
TWELVE STEPS AND THEY KNOW HOW

00:14:08.314 --> 00:14:09.848
TO WORK -- SO THEY GET TOGETHER

00:14:09.915 --> 00:14:12.585
ON THEIR OWN AND THEY START TO

00:14:12.651 --> 00:14:13.352
TO WORK THOSE STEPS SO THAT THEY

00:14:13.419 --> 00:14:15.154
CAN WORK ON THEIR RECOVERY AND

00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:17.256
SO SOMETIMES WHEN PROGRAMS ARE

00:14:17.323 --> 00:14:20.159
NOT AVAILABLE -- THEY TAKE THE

00:14:20.226 --> 00:14:22.461
INITIATIVE -- TO FIND THINGS

00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:23.829
THAT WILL ASSIST THEM OR EVEN

00:14:23.896 --> 00:14:27.233
GET A OTHER DOCUMENTS FROM OR

00:14:27.299 --> 00:14:28.534
YOU KNOW SOME OF THE LESSONS

00:14:28.601 --> 00:14:29.134

00:14:30.502 --> 00:14:32.371
OF OTHER OFFENDERS ARI AND HAND

00:14:32.438 --> 00:14:35.507
pTO THAT PROGRAM INFORMATION TO

00:14:35.574 --> 00:14:37.309
CHECK TO WORK ON THEIR CHANGE

00:14:37.376 --> 00:14:39.645
AND SO SOMETIMES.

00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:40.846
WE WE WOULD REALLY LIKE.

00:14:40.913 --> 00:14:42.214

00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:43.215
INTO ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS MORE

00:14:43.282 --> 00:14:45.251
BUT WHEN THERE ARE NO PROGRAMS

00:14:45.317 --> 00:14:45.951
AVAILABLE.

00:14:46.018 --> 00:14:47.186
AND MANY OF THE INMATES HAVE

00:14:47.253 --> 00:14:49.588
FOUND WAYS -- TO REALLY WORK ON

00:14:49.655 --> 00:14:56.061

00:14:56.695 --> 00:14:56.829
THAT.

00:14:56.895 --> 00:14:57.796
JUST CHECKING BOXES OF HAVING

00:14:57.863 --> 00:14:58.397
TAKEN A PROGRAM DOESN'T

00:14:58.464 --> 00:14:59.732
NECESSARILY SATISFY WHAT YOU'RE

00:14:59.798 --> 00:15:02.201

00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:08.140
SO CERTAINLY WE CAN SEE WE OWE

00:15:08.207 --> 00:15:09.375
THE INMATES COME IN AND TELL US

00:15:09.441 --> 00:15:10.276

AT INFORMATION IN THERE SEE FILE

00:15:13.078 --> 00:15:14.546
AND AND SEE THAT.

00:15:14.613 --> 00:15:15.514
THAT'S NOT THE CASE THEIR

00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:16.815
BEHAVIOR HASN'T CHANGED BECAUSE

00:15:16.882 --> 00:15:18.350
THERE MAY BE RULE VIOLATION

00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:20.052
REPORTS THAT TELL US THAT.

00:15:20.119 --> 00:15:22.388
THEY MAY SAY THAT -- THEY'VE YOU

00:15:22.454 --> 00:15:23.589
KNOW REALLY TRIED IN SCHOOL BUT

00:15:23.656 --> 00:15:25.224
THE TEACHER MAY PROVIDE A

00:15:25.291 --> 00:15:26.458
DOCUMENT THAT SAID THAT HE

00:15:26.525 --> 00:15:28.694

HEARINGS ON TRANSGENDER FEMALES

00:26:41.967 --> 00:26:45.203

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:46.137
IT IN ONE PARTICULAR CASE WHEN I

00:26:46.204 --> 00:26:48.974
RAN INTO WAS REALLY HAVING.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.776
TO TAKE A REALLY GOOD LOOK AT

00:26:51.843 --> 00:26:54.179
THE RULE VIOLATION REPORTS --

00:26:54.245 --> 00:26:57.215
THAT ALONG THE PRISON IN THE

00:26:57.282 --> 00:26:58.316
DATE THE TIME IN WHICH THE

00:26:58.383 --> 00:26:59.718
INMATE WAS IN PRISON -- AND

00:26:59.784 --> 00:27:02.253
REALLY WHAT I FOUND WAS THAT THE

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.822
THERE WAS A A POINT IN TIME

00:27:03.888 --> 00:27:06.057
WHERE THERE MAY HAVE BEEN MORE

00:27:06.124 --> 00:27:08.426

INMATE AND SO I HAD TO REALLY

00:27:12.664 --> 00:27:15.166

00:27:15.233 --> 00:27:16.768
HAPPEN IN WAS.

00:27:16.835 --> 00:27:19.004

WHICH SHE BEING VICTIMIZED AND

00:27:19.938 --> 00:27:20.805

READING THE RULE VIOLATION

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.375
REPORTS THAT.

00:27:23.441 --> 00:27:25.477
IT WAS NOT THAT THIS PERSON WAS

00:27:25.543 --> 00:27:27.045
A VIOLENT.

00:27:27.112 --> 00:27:28.413
