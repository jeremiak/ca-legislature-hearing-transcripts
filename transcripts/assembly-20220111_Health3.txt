GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR. AND MEMBERS I FIRST WANT TO START BY THANKING SCOTT BAIN- THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF ON THIS BILL HE'S GONE ABOVE AND BEYOND AND WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE FIVE TWO WOULD ALLOW NOT TO REQUIRE SCHOOLS AND COUNTIES TO ENTER INTO AN INTEGRATED SCHOOL BASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM TO PROVIDE EARLY INTERVENTION AND ACCESS. TO BEHAVIORAL AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR ALL STUDENTS. PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC REPORTS HAVE PROVIDED STARTLING INFORMATION ON THE MENTAL HEALTH AND BEHAVIOUR LANDSCAPE OF SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN AND YOUTH AS WE KNOW THINGS ONLY GOT WORSE IN ORANGE COUNTY. WE HAVE THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF ORANGE COUNTY AND THE REPORTS OF SUICIDES DURING THIS TIME THE NUMBERS HAVE STARTED LEE GONE WAY UP. SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS HAVE SEEN A STEADY RISE I'M NOT ONLY TRAUMA FROM STUDENTS ANXIETY DEPRESSION AND AS I MENTIONED SUICIDAL THOUGHTS. SOCIAL MEDIA BULLYING SCHOOL SHOOTINGS FAMILY SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND POVERTY OR SOME OF THE UNDERLYING CAUSES AND ADDS THAT WE ALL KNOW TOO WELL COVERT NINETEEN HAS JUST MADE THIS CRISIS EVEN WORSE STUDENTS HAVE BEEN OUT OF SCHOOL FOR OVER A YEAR SINCE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN. AND AGAIN EVEN SINCE THESE NOTES HAVE BEEN WRITTEN WE NOW SEE SCHOOLS HAVING TO POSSIBLY PIVOT BACK TO ONLINE- EDUCATION. BEHAVIOR HEALTH MENTAL WELLNESS AND SUPPORT HAVE BEEN CRUCIAL SINCE STUDENTS HAVE RETURNED TO SCHOOL AND OF WITH THIS BILL WE MUST DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ADDRESS THIS IMPORTANT NEED. TODAY WITH ME VIA PHONE I HAVE TWO WITNESSES MISS SHEFALI I'M SORRY I'M GONNA SAY THIS WRONG MISCHIEF FREE POLY D. SAW ASSISTANT VICE PRESIDENT OF THE SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH AND EARLY EDUCATION SERVICES. WHAT THE HEALTH WILL HAVE A HALF AWAY SIR SYCAMORES CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES AND MS HELLO COLE ARDO DIRECTOR GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS THE COUNTY BEHAVIOR HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA.

AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PROGRAM AT THE LADIES AND COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THE PROUD CO SPONSORS AND AB FIVE FIVE TO. EIGHTY FIVE FIVE TWO AS MENTIONED WOULD CREATE THE INTEGRATED SCHOOL BASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM ENCOURAGING LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES AND COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGENCIES TO COLLABORATE. ON PROVIDING SERVICES ON CAMPUS FOR STUDENTS AT THE EARLIEST ONSET IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITION. AS MENTIONED THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS CREATED A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER FOR THE PROVISION OF BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES. AT A TIME WHEN THE THOSE SERVICES CONTINUE TO FIX THE NEED FOR THE SERVICES CONTINUES TO GROW. AS A RESULT THERE'S AN UNPRECEDENTED RISE IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS AMONG THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH ACCORDING TO THE CDC. A PORTION OF CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH RELATED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS AMONG ALL PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS INCREASED BY MORE THAN THIRTY PERCENT. I REMAINS ELEVATED AS THE PANDEMIC CONTINUES. COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGENCIES HAVE BEEN PROVIDING SERVICES TO MEDICAL STUDENT BENEFICIARIES AND UNINSURED STUDENTS ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES SINCE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. ACCORDING TO A SURVEY OF COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGENCIES A BARRIER ENCOUNTERED TO EXPANDING COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES. IS THE RELUCTANCE ON THE PART OF SCHOOLS TO ALLOW COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ON CAMPUSES UNLESS ALL STUDENTS CAN BE SERVED STUDENTS. UNDERSTANDABLY SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS ARE RELUCTANT TO HAVE A GROUP OF STUDENTS TREATED DIFFERENTLY IF A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEED ARISES. IN SCHOOLS PARTICIPATING IN THE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGENCY TRAINED PROFESSIONALS WILL SERVE ANY STUDENT APPROPRIATELY REFERRED BY SCHOOL PERSONNEL INCLUDING PRIVATELY INSURED STUDENTS. AND PROVIDE BRIEF UNUSUAL INTERVENTION SERVICES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO LIVE TO DELIVER ON. THE SCHOOL SITE AND INTENDED TO PREVENT A BEHAVIOR HOW CONDITION FROM WORSE. CAN BEHAVIORAL FOR. WILL PRIVATE INSURED STUDENTS AT A PRIVATE PLAN. IF AVAIL. AND IF THE PRIVATE CAN PROVIDE AN APPROPRIATE PROVIDER WITHIN STATE MANDATED TIMELY ACCESS TIME FRAME FOR ANY REASON INCLUDING THE CURRENT STATEWIDE SHORTAGE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS- COUNTY WILL THEN HAVE BEEN AND WILL INITIATE SERVICES.

MR DALY. I SEE YOU HERE. CHU DALY YOU HAVE AB. NINE THIRTY THREE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. A RECENT REPORT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE FOUND THAT MANUFACTURED DRUG REBATES IN CALIFORNIA TOTALED APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO YEARS AGO. THAT FIGURE REPRESENTS OVER 14% OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT SPENT ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IN OUR STATE RESULTING PBMS AND INSURERS PAYING 40% LESS THAN THE LIST PRICE OF THE MEDICATION. SADLY THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT THE SAVINGS ARE SHARED WITH CONSUMERS. THIS BILL PROPOSES TO SAVE PATIENTS MONEY AT THE PHARMACY COUNTER BY REQUIRING THAT 90% OF MANUFACTURER REBATES ARE SHARED DIRECTLY WITH CONSUMERS. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL AND I ACCEPT ALL FIVE OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. LEANDRA CLARK HARVEY WITH THE ACCESS COALITION IN A SURE LYSYK. WITH THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA WILL BE SPEAKING IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER DALY- WE DO HAVE ONE OF THE WITNESSES HERE IN THE CHAMBER SO PLEASE PLEASE GO AHEAD WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN WIDE- YOU WILL HEAR FROM THE ACCESS COALITION TODAY'S THAT REBATES AND DISCOUNTS ARE PAID BY MANUFACTURERS TO MAKE MEDICINES MORE AFFORDABLE TO CONSUMERS. AND YOU'LL HEAR DATA FROM THEM THAT- FIND THAT REBATES IN CALIFORNIA NOW TOTAL OVER A BILLION DOLLARS. WHAT I WANT TO SPEND MY TIME ON IN. MY BRIEF TESTIMONY IS ON HOW THIS WILL ACTUALLY BENEFIT THE CONSUMER WHEN THEY GO TO THE PHARMACY COUNTER- A RECENT U. S. SENATE FINANCE REPORT WAS RELEASED. ON INSULIN IN THE REBATES IN THAT SYSTEM. ONE OF THE EXAMPLES THAT THEY FOUND. WAS THAT A VERY COMMON INSULIN HAD A SEVENTY NINE POINT SEVEN FIVE PERCENT. REBATE OFF THE LIST PRICE- THAT WAS PAID FOR TO THE PBM. SO RIGHT NOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN. A CALIFORNIA AND GOES TO THE PHARMACY COUNTER IS THEY PAY FULL LIST PRICE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR AND THE DEDUCTIBLE PERIOD. OR FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR THAT INSULIN. IF THIS BILL WAS TO GO INTO EFFECT. THAT SAME CALIFORNIA AND WHEN THEY WENT TO THE PHARMACY COUNTER WOULD ONLY PAY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS FOR THAT SAME INSULIN. BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE BENEFITING FROM THOSE REBATES. AND NOT EXAMPLE. THE HEALTH PLAN WILL CONTINUE TO PAY NOTHING BECAUSE THE PATIENT WAS IN THE DEDUCTIBLE PERIOD. AND THEY WOULD STILL RECEIVE A REBATE OF THIRTY FOUR DOLLARS. WE THINK THAT THIS. MEASURE IS IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIANS AND WILL HELP THEM AT THE PHARMACY COUNTER AND I- APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I BELIEVE WE HAVE ANOTHER WITNESS ON THE PHONE- MRS ODDLY UNDER CLARK WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. AFTERNOON KAREN COMMITTEE MEMBERS BUSINESS ACTUALLY ON RECORD PART OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ACCENT COALITION SPONSORED EIGHTY NINE THIRTY THREE. WE THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAILY IN OUR SPECS ASSEMBLY AND SENATE CO AUTHOR OF THE TWELVE MORE THAN THIRTY ORGANIZATIONS FOR THEIR SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE. OUR GOAL IS TO LOWER PATIENTS OUT OF POCKET COSTS FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. AT TWENTY TWENTY STUDY BY THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION FOUND THAT 51% OF CALIFORNIANS SKIP OR POSTPONED CARE DUE TO COST. AND OF THOSE WHO PUT OFF HERE 41% SAID DOING SO WORTH IT WORSENED THEIR CONDITION. THIS TREND- GROWING HEALTHCARE DUE TO HIGH COST IS UNTENABLE AN EIGHTY NINE THIRTY THREE PROVIDE THE REMEDY ASSEMBLY SHOULD NOT FIX TO FIX THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BREEDING HAS DONE. ACCORDING TO A STUDY RELEASED JUST DAYS AGO BY THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFITS REVIEW PROGRAMS COMMISSION BY THIS VERY COMMITTEE. EIGHTY NINE THIRTY THREE WOULD SAVE AT LEAST EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY SIX THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS NEARLY SEVENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR ALONE. HOW BY CORRECTING A REGULATORY OVERSIGHT THAT ALLOW PRESCRIPTION DRUG REBATES PAID BY PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS TO GO TO HEALTH INSURERS AND PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER PROFIT. RATHER THAN TO KEEP CONSUMERS FROM WHICH THEY ARE INTENDED TO HELP. THE SAVINGS TO PBMS AND INSURERS UNDER THE CURRENT REBATE SYSTEM ARE SIGNIFICANT. AND WITH THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF A REBATE BEING 40% OFF THE LIST PRICE OF THE MEDICATION FOR EXAMPLE. IS THE LIST PRICE OF THE DRUG OF A HUNDRED DOLLARS A PDM CAN BECAUSE SHE TO REBATE A FORTY DOLLARS MY MEDICATION FOR THE PBMS AND THEIR INSURED CLIENTS ONLY PAY SIXTY DOLLARS. BUT UNDER THE CURRENT REBATE SYSTEM AND UNLIKE MOST OTHER CONSUMER REBATE PROGRAMS TEACHING DON'T RECEIVE A DYNAMIC THAT REBATE OUT THE PHARMACY COUNTER. INSTEAD OF POPPING. THE REBATES BACK TO PATIENT. IN PART OF THE READING AND GIVE THEM REST OF THE INSURANCE COMPANY. INTO NINETY ALLOW. PBMS IN THE U. S. NICO. IN POINT BILLION IN READ IT OVERALL. AND A RECENT FROM THE- OF HEALTHCARE FOUND THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY. HEALTH PLANS IN CALIFORNIA RECEIVED MORE THAN ONE POINT FOUR BILLION AND REBATES FROM MANUFACTURERS. WHICH IS A 57% INCREASE FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN. TO WHILE PBMS AND INSURERS MAKE BILLIONS PATIENTS OFTEN END UP PAYING MORE FOR THE PRESCRIPTION IN THE PBMS AND INSURERS PAID FOR. PATIENTS WHO HAVE NOT MET THEIR HEALTH PLAN DEDUCTIBLE MAX PAY OUT OF POCKET AT THE PHARMACY COUNTER AND ARE OFTEN FORCED TO PAY THE FULL PRICE OF THE MEDICATION. NOT THE REBATE PRICE HERE THE PBMS AND INSURERS ONLY PAY SIXTY DOLLARS AS A PATIENT HAS A HUNDRED. THIS BILL IF NECESSARY TO LOWERING PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION COSTS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING THE THOUSANDS OF SMALL BUSINESSES AND THEIR EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE HIGH DEDUCTIBLE HEALTH PLANS AND FACE HIGH OUT OF POCKET COSTS. MAKE IT DIFFICULT AND OFTEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO AFFORD THE MEDICATIONS THEY NEED TO GET AND STAY WELL SO LET'S DO THE RIGHT THING FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS THANK YOU. FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE DO HAVE TO WITNESS. AN OPPOSITION SO GO AHEAD MOVE ON TO THE OPPOSITION WITNESSES ON THE PHONE PLEASE- I'M SORRY IN PERSON. YOU'RE BOTH IN PERSON OKAY PLEASE COME FORWARD AND SHOCKED SO THANK YOU NICKEL RESOURCE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS HAPPY NEW YEAR AND IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE IN PERSON. AFTER A COUPLE YEARS- WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS AGAIN AND- YOU KNOW WE ARE REGRETTABLY OPPOSE- EIGHTY NINE THIRTY THREE. WE DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR ANY STAFF THEY BROUGHT US IN EARLY ON IN THE PROCESS AS THEY WERE DEVELOPING THIS PROPOSAL. BUT I REGRETTABLY WE HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENT- WE BELIEVE THAT THE COST TO EMPLOYERS EMPLOYEES AND INDIVIDUALS FAR OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS OF THIS LEGISLATION. AND THIS IS MOREMOST CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED- BY THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS BY THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFITS REVIEW PROGRAMMER CHIPPER. A CHIPPER CONCLUDED THAT THIS BILL WOULD INCREASE PREMIUMS IN THE FIRST YEAR BY TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- IN THE EMPLOYER ANY DIFFICULT FOR EMPLOYERS AND INDIVIDUALS AT COVERED CALIFORNIA- SO THAT WOULD MAKE IT THE SECOND HIGHEST THE HIGHEST COSTA MANDATE BILL OF THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION. I'M DISCUSSES ALMOST THREE TIMES A PURPORTED SEVENTY MILLION DOLLAR BENEFIT THAT WILL BE EXPERIENCED BY SOME CONSUMERS. I'M IN OTHER WORDS CONSUMERS WILL COLLECTIVELY PAY MORE SO THAT SOME MIGHT PAY LESS AND WE DON'T BELIEVE IT'S REALLY PENCILS OUT. A SIMILAR PROPOSAL WAS CONSIDERED- AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL FOR MEDICARE PART D. UNDER THE PRIOR FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM IN THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE. ULTIMATELY CONCLUDED THAT THE PROPOSAL WOULD COST THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVER TEN YEARS. AND THAT THE MAJORITY OF BENEFICIARIES WOULD SEE AN INCREASE IN THEIR TOTAL OUT OF POCKET COSTS AND PREMIUMS. SO WE DON'T BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE TRYING TO SING CALIFORNIA. ON THE OTHER ISSUES WITH THIS BILL FROM POLICY PERSPECTIVE ARE. IT LEADS TO A PRIORITIZATION OF EXPENSIVE BRAND NAME DRUGS- OVER LOW COST ALTERNATIVES LIKE GENERICS. IN THIS IS BECAUSE REBATES ARE REALLY FOUND. ON THE BRAND NAME DRUG SIDE- ALSO THERE'S NO EASY WAY TO IMPLEMENT THIS BILL- REBATES ARE NOT ALWAYS. REAL TIME FOR MANY OF THE HEALTH PLANS. A REBATE MAY NOT BE GRANTED ARE GRANTED IN THE- ESTIMATE EXPECTED. IN THERE ARE A VARIETY OF REASONS FOR THIS IT WOULD TAKE LONGER THAN I HAVE. BUT IN MANY CASES IF THERE IS A REBATE IT ISN'T ACTUALLY SECURED UNTIL THREE TO SIX MONTHS LATER IF NOT LONGER. SO THIS BILL DOES NOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESS IN OUR VIEW. THE FUNDAMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION ISSUE ALREADY BENEFIT FROM THE REBATES THAT OUR MEMBERS ARE ABLE TO SECURE FROM THE DRUG MANUFACTURERS. THESE REDUCE REDUCE THE OVERALL SPEND FOR PLANS WHICH ALLOWS MY MEMBERS TO KEEP PREMIUMS IN CHECK. FOR INSTANCE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST SB SEVENTEEN TRANSPARENCY REPORTS ISSUED BY REGULATORS. REBATES HELPS DRUG REBATES HELP REDUCE TOTAL HEALTH PLAN PREMIUMS BY ONE POINT 8% IN TWENTY TWENTY. THAT'S ABOUT TEN DOLLARS PER MEMBER PER MONTH. SO WHY WOULD WE WANT TO INTERFERE WITH THE ABILITY PLAN STOPS IT PREMIUMS ARE REBATES. FINALLY ARE QUALIFIED HEALTH PLANS THAT COVER CALIFORNIA- ARE WORKING ON COST SHARING REDUCTION STRATEGIES WITH THE EXCHANGE. THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN A WAY THAT AVOIDS THE PITFALLS OF THIS BILL. THAT WORK WAS REQUIRED LAST YEAR THROUGH THE BUDGET. AND IT WAS ALLUDED TO IN THE IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL YESTERDAY. SO WE APPRECIATE THE INTENT BEHIND THE AMENDMENTS- HOWEVER IT DOESN'T HELP AVOID THE MASSIVE FIRST YEAR COSTS OF THIS BILL. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OUR NEXT WITNESS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS PRESTON YOUNG FROM THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HERE TODAY AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO AB NINE THIRTY THREE WELL CERTAINLY WELL INTENTIONED BILL IT UNFORTUNATELY COMES ALONG WITH UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OUR PRIMARY CONCERN WITH AB NINE THREE THREE IS THAT DESPITE PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES REMAINING UNAFFECTED THEIR COST INCREASES ASSOCIATED WITH THE BILL IS FOR PRINT CHAMBER ANALYSIS INDICATED THE BILL BECAUSE EMPLOYER PREMIUMS TO RISE NEARLY A HUNDRED NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN EMPLOYEE PREMIUMS RISE OVER FORTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS. A CONCERN EIGHTY NINE THIRTY THREE WOULD BENEFIT A SMALL GROUP OF PATIENTS ALL PATIENTS WOULD HAVE TO PAY MORE FOR THE HEALTHCARE OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS AVERAGE FAMILY HEALTH PLAN PREMIUMS HAVE INCREASED 22% A TWO THOUSAND TWENTY KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION OF POOR HEALTH BENEFITS SURVEY INDICATED THAT FOR JOB BASED COVERAGE THE AVERAGE ANNUAL PREMIUM FOR FAMILY COVERAGE IS THE NINE THIRTY THREE ADDRESSES AN IMPORTANT ISSUE NO DOUBT WE NEED TO REMAIN COGNIZANT OF THE IMPACT OF THESE MANDATES HAVE ON DRIVING HEALTH CARE COSTS UPWARD WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS WE APPRECIATE THE CONSIDERATION THAT WENT INTO THIS BILL UNFORTUNATELY WITH THE TO YOUR SUNSET DATE THE COST WILL STILL BE IMPACTING EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE SO FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE- RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED AB NINE THREE THREE THANK YOU.

ONE NINETY NINE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. OKAY AND WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE INTO AT THIS TIME OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR STRUCTURE COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SO I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS- AND- I GUESS THE FIRST ONE FIRST OF ALL APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THE BILL- AND I THINK ALL ALL CONSUMERS WILL HAVE LOWER PRICES- AND- THAT IS A THAT IS ADMIRABLE- AS I'VE SAID FROM THE BEGINNING I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS WE'VE HEARD THAT SOMETIMES ARE REBATES NOW TAKE. MY TAKE SEVERAL MONTHS SO I DON'T KNOW HOW WE DO THAT AT A POINT OF SALE. YOU'VE BEEN TO A PHARMACY LATELY REALIZE THAT- IT SOMETIMES TAKES TEN YEAR TEN TIMES LONGER JUST TO PICK UP A PRESCRIPTION THAT THAT YOU'VE BEEN THAT THAT WAS CALLED IN EVEN DAYS BEFORE SO WE'RE TASKING. BUT OVER WORK SYSTEM WITH SOMETHING NEW THAT. IS GOING TO BE REALLY DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT AND SO THAT'S WHY I'VE SAID MY IMPLEMENTATION CONCERNS OF HAVE BEEN THERE FOR THE YES AND I RESPECT THOSE MISTER CHAIR- BUT I GUESS MY QUESTION FOR THE PROPONENTS IS. WHAT KEEPS THE DRUG COMPANIES FROM JUST. RAISING PRICES EVEN HIGHER SEE POTENTIAL. CONSUMER BENEFIT. ON THE REBATE. BUT I DON'T SEE A BENEFIT. ANYTHING THAT HELPS TO KEEP THE PRICES LOWER. OR FROM GOING HIGHER NEEDLESSLY. HI CHAIRMAN LLOYD THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I THINK WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN IN THE MARKET OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IS THAT COMPETITION TO MAKE PRICES MORE AFFORDABLE FOR HEALTH PLANS AND PBMS IS REALLY ON THE REBATED PRICE AND SO THEY ARE LOOKING TO GET A BETTER PRICE ON THEIR DRUGS THROUGH NEGOTIATING A HIGHER REBATE SO OVER TIME WE HAVE SEEN. GROWTH IN REBATES IF YOU LOOK JUST IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE'VE GONE FROM A NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN REBATES BEING PAID TO ONE FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN REBATES AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S CREATED A PERVERSE INCENTIVE WHERE A HIGHER REBATE IS ACTUALLY PREFERRED OVER A LOWER LIST PRICE DRUG AND SO YOU KNOW WHILE THIS BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS THAT SYSTEM THAT I THINK IS IN NEED OF FIXING IT DOES MAKE SURE THAT THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER IS BENEFITING- FROM THOSE REBATE AS AS THEY GO UP HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I GUESS IF THE REBATES IF THIS SYSTEM IS A PROBLEM WHY WHY WOULDN'T YOU BE LOOKING AT A WAY TO CHANGE THE REBATE SYSTEM WHERE THE PROBLEM IS RATHER THAN TRYING THIS ANGLE OF IT BECAUSE CLEARLY I KNOW WHERE THE PROBLEM IS YOU KNOW WHERE THE PROBLEM IS YOU YOU ILLUSTRATED VERY GOOD POINT. M. OFTEN AS PART OF THE FORMULARY WANT THAT BIGGER REBATES SO A LESS EXPENSIVE DRUG DOESN'T GET CONSIDERED BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET AS MUCH OF A REPAIR. SO WHY NOT GO AFTER THAT AS A WAY TO HELP PROTECT THE CONSUMER BECAUSE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY LOWER PREMIUMS BECAUSE THE YOUR BILL. ACTUALLY WILL LEAD TO INCREASE PREMIUMS AS WE'VE HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION SO. HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WOULDN'T GO IN THAT DIRECTION. I THINK YOU KNOW PHARMA DOES SUPPORT RIGHT- TRANSFORMING THE REBATE SYSTEM AT A FEDERAL LEVEL- I THINK DOING THAT AT A STATE BY STATE BASIS COULD. COULD HAVE THE PERVERSE INCENTIVES IN A CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC MARKET PLACE SO REALLY WE NEED TO SEE IT CHANGED AT A NATIONAL LEVEL- AS FAR AS THE POINT ON PREMIUMS HEARING CALIFORNIA I DO WANT TO NOTE AS PART OF THAT TRIP BURKE REPORTS THAT WHILE. EXPENDITURES ARE EXPECTED TO GROW TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. A MAJORITY OF THAT IS DUE TO- X. THE EXPECTATION THAT PEOPLE ARE MORE ADHERENT TO THEIR MEDICINE AND THAT THERE IS INCREASED UTILIZATION AND THEN ALSO INCREASED COST TO THE PLAN FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. OKAY I STILL I STILL DON'T SEE WHERE THERE'S ANY INCENTIVE OR OR ANY ANY WAY TO KEEP. THE COST AND THE PRICE THE PRICES FROM GOING UP. SO WHAT ABOUT SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T HAVE INSURANCE COME COVERAGE OR HAS A REALLY HIGH DEDUCTIBLE AND HAS TO PAY THAT DEDUCTIBLE. THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE A READ THAT THERE MAY NOT BE A REBATE ABOUT AVAILABLE TO THEM SO HOW DOES THAT HELP THAT CONSUMER BECAUSE THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE. WHO DON'T HAVE. THE YOU KNOW HE MAY NOT HAVE A PLAN THAT ALLOWS THEM TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A REBATE SO HOW DOES THAT HELP THAT CONSUMER PEOPLE HAVE INSURANCE HEALTH CARE IS NOT BUT THAT WASN'T MY QUESTION. IF THAT WAS MICHAEL IF I IF I DON'T HAVE INSURANCE. AND YOUR PRICE IS REALLY HIGH AND YOU KEEP RAISING PRICES. BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA GET REBATES TO SOMEBODY. HOW DOES THAT HELP THE POOR PERSON WHO DOESN'T HAVE MEDICATION INSURANCE. AND THEN THE POINT IS THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE INURANCE. AND WE'RE FOCUSING ON THOSE HIGH PRICE DRUGS- THAT THAT THAT ARE OUT THERE SO HOW DOES IT HELP THAT POOR PERSON WHO DOESN'T HAVE INSURANCE. GOING TO THE COUNTER AND GET STUCK WITH THAT BIG BILL HELP ME HELP ME UNDERSTAND THAT. I THINK QUITE FRANKLY SPELL IT DOESN'T ADDRESS PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE INSURANCE SO YOU DON'T HAVE INSURANCE AND YOU DON'T GET A REBATE. YOU JUST PAY THE HIGH PRICE. CORRECT THAT DOESN'T FEEL VERY FAIR TO ME. ALL THE AND I WILL SAY FOR PATIENTS THAT DON'T HAVE INSURANCE WE DO HAVE MANUFACTURERS ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS TO HELP MAKE THEIR MEDICATIONS MORE AFFORDABLE- AS FOR THE PATIENT WHO IS AT A HIGH DEDUCTIBLE HEALTH PLAN THIS IS THE BILL THAT'S GOING TO HELP THEM THE MOST BECAUSE WHEN THEY'RE EXPOSED TO THE LOWEST PRICE IT'S WHEN THEY'RE IN THEIR DEDUCTIBLE PERIOD- SO THIS BILL WILL ENSURE ANYTIME THAT THEY'RE IN THE DEDUCTIBLE THAT THEY ACTUALLY BENEFIT FROM THAT NOT PRICE OF THE MEDICINE THE REBATED PRICE OF THE MEDICINE NOT THE HIGHER LIST PRICES AND I JUST I. SO WHEN I JUST LOWER THE PRICES YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA GET THE ROUTE YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WHERE THE- YOU KNOW WHAT THE- THE WHOLESALE ACQUISITION COSTS ARE YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS. WHEN I JUST LOWER THE PRICES AND MAKE IT AFFORDABLE FOR. PEOPLE WITHOUT REPAYING. YEAH I THINK. THIS IS DEFINITELY A COMPLEX SYSTEM- AND OUR PRICES ARE NOT SET IN A VACUUM AND THAT SAME. U. S. SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT. THEY LOOKED AT GENERIC INSULIN THAT IS NOW COME TO MARKET THERE'S A- BIOSIMILAR INSULIN THAT COST. LESS THAN HALF OF ANY BRAND NAME INSULIN THAT'S ON THE MARKET TODAY. AND LARGE FORMULA ARIES LIKE EXPRESS SCRIPTS WHO HAS. A LARGER POPULATION IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY OF FRANCE. DOESN'T COVER THAT INSULIN ON THEIR PREFERRED FORMULARY. SO LET ME LET ME POSE YOUR QUESTION THAT I'VE MY PRODUCT ACTUALLY WE TALKED YESTERDAY. THERE'S A THERE'S A MEDICATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF KOVAN- THERE'S A COUPLE OF THEM BUT I'LL JUST TAKE TAKE ONE NOT GONNA NAME THE COMPANY. THE COST FOR THAT TEN DAY COURSE OF TREATMENT IS SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. NOW INDIA HAS CREATED A GENERIC DRUG. THAT COSTA TEAM IS EIGHTEEN DOLLARS. SO AND THAT SAME COMPANIES CAN INVEST IN OTHER COMPANIES IN INDIA. HOW DID THAT COMPANY IN INDIA TO PROVIDE THIS **** THIS DRUG TO OTHER LOWER LOWER LOWER INCOME COUNTRIES AT THAT LOWER PRICE. SO IN THIS COUNTRY OF WITH THIS IF THIS COURSE OF TREATMENT IS SEVEN YOU KNOW SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS TO THE DRUG COMPANIES ARE DRUG COMPANY GOING TO BE WILLING TO REBATE SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO DOLLARS TO THE CONSUMER BECAUSE THAT'S A YEAH WE CAN DO IT IN ANOTHER COUNTRY- WHY CAN'T WE DO IT HERE. I DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFICS OF THE DAY- KOBE NINETEEN TREATMENT THAT YOU'RE SPEAKING OUT BY. I CAN TELL YOU THAT FOR ANY- TREATMENT THAT WAS DEVELOPED FOR KOBE NINETEEN THAT THAT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS- PROCURED THOSE THOSE TREATMENTS AND VACCINES AND ARE GUARANTEED- SPECIAL PRICING AND BEST PRICING SO THEY ARE GETTING REBATES AND DISCOUNTS ON THAT MEDICATION. AND WE'RE PAYING FOR IT AS CONSUMERS AS TAXPAYERS AS WELL. WHEN IT WHEN WE WHEN WE DO SO- YOU KNOW AND I. I WILL SAY YOU KNOW WOW WELL THE BILL CLAIMS TO YOU KNOW HIM IMPROVE PATIENT ACCESS TO DRUGS I AM UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE APPROACH- TO REBATES AT THE POINT OF SALE BECAUSE I DON'T SEE HOW YOU IMPLEMENT THAT. TIME WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT- AND THE INCENTIVE TOWARDS HIGH COST EXPENSIVE BRAND NAME DRUGS ARE ARE THERE ARE THERE IS AN INCENTIVE IN THAT DIRECTION RATHER THAN TOWARDS GENERICS BECAUSE- THAT. THAT'S THAT'S HOW I VIEW THIS SYSTEM- AND WE'RE NOT REALLY LOOKING AT A KEPT TAKING A COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT THE RISING COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS MATTER FACT THERE'S NOTHING TO PREVENT THE COMPANY'S FROM ACTUALLY DOING THAT- AND THE- IMPACTS OF HEALTH CARE COSTS AND AFFORDABILITY- I'M- YOU KNOW. I'D LIKE AN INSURANCE THAT THE CONSUMERS WILL ACTUALLY BENEFIT FROM THE BILL AND THAT'S WHEN. YOU KNOW WHITE WE'VE- PUT OUT THE A AMENDMENTS WHICH HAVE AGREED TO AND I THINK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT. IT WOULD ASK FOR AMENDMENTS- AND AN ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DRUGS IMPACT ON A PRESCRIPTION DRUG SPENDING. AND HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS. HI IN SPITE OF MY REALLY POINTED COMMENTS HERE I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. BECAUSE OF THE INTENT. AND MY HOPE IS THAT DURING THE PROCESS THERE WILL BE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I HAVE RUN IMPLEMENTATION WILL BE WATCHING CLOSELY IF THE BILL COMES BACK ON CONCERT CONCURRENCE. IT HOPEFULLY MEETS THAT MEETS WHAT WE'RE WE'RE ALL LOOKING FOR HERE- BEFORE THAT BILL. WOULD MOVE FORWARD SO. I WITH THAT- WOULD YOU LIKE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE MISTER DAVE MISTER CHAIR I RESPECT THE- MORE GLOBAL. CONCERNS YOU'VE EXPRESSED. ABOUT TO. THE PRICE OF DRUGS OVERALL. AND I RESPECT YOUR- DISLIKE OF THE REBATE SYSTEM THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO TAKE A PART OF THAT REBATE SYSTEM AND MAKE IT BETTER HOPEFULLY IT'LL IT'LL CAUSE NO DAMAGE ELSEWHERE- SHOULD IT BECOME LAW- AND I THINK WE'LL ALL LEARN IF THE BILL DOES BECOME LAW WE'LL ALL LEARN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. WHAT THE REBATES SKEWS ME THE REBATE SYSTEM.

AB THIRTEEN FIFTY FIVE WOULD EXPAND THE RIGHT TO INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEWS I AM ARE AS TALL MEDIKAL MEMBERS REGARDLESS OF PLAN OR SERVICE AN INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW IS A SECONDARY REVIEW. OF THE DENIAL OF THE MEDICAL SERVICE BY AN INDEPENDENT PANEL OF PHYSICIANS CURRENTLY CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE HAVE ACCESS TO I AM OURS THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE. FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE HOWEVER NOT ALL MEDICAL MEMBERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO AN EXTERNAL APPEAL REVIEWED BY CLINICAL EXPERTS. THE IMR OPTION IS NOT AVAILABLE TO OVER FOUR MILLION MEDI CAL PATIENTS. ADDITIONALLY MANY SERVICES ARE NOT PROVIDED BY CERTAIN MEDIKAL PLANS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR I AM MORE INCLUDING SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH. MOST DENTAL SERVICES AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS PROVIDED THROUGH MEDICAID ARE ACTS AFFECTED JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AB THIRTEEN FIFTY FIVE WILL BRING PARITY IN ACCESS TO AYE EMAAR'S AMONGST MEDICARE MEMBERS AND FOR SERVICES NOT PROVIDED BY THE PLAN. AND IMPROVE THE STATE FAIR HEARING PROCESS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I BELIEVE HAVE COUPLE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WILL- WE'LL TAKE OUR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ON THE PHONE AND WHENEVER YOU'RE READY PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. YES PLEASE GO AHEAD BUT- GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHEN MEMBERS BY THE FASHION ON WITH LEGAL SERVICES OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE PROVIDE DIRECT LEGAL ASSISTANCE TO HELP CONSUMERS IN THIRTY TWO COUNTIES IN NEARLY HALF OF THOSE COUNTY AS MEDICARE ENROLLEES DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE ACCESS TO INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW WHEN THERE TONIGHT HEALTHCARE SERVICES BASED ON MEDICAL NECESSITY FOR THOSE CONSUMERS WHEN THEY ARE DENIED HEALTHCARE SERVICE A HEART SURGERY A PRESCRIPTION PATIENTS THEIR ONLY OPTION FOR APPEALING TO DO NOW IS TO GO TO THE STATE FAIR HEARING PROCESS. IS PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE YOU THEN HAVE AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE WITH NO MEDICAL TRAINING OR CLINICAL EXPERIENCE EVALUATING MEDICAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS PATIENT RECORDS MEDICAL JOURNALS STUDIES AND LAB TESTS TO MAKE AND THEN MEDICAL THE TECHNICIAN CITY DETERMINATION. TO PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE I HAD A CLIENT WHO WAS DENIED A MEDICATION BECAUSE THE HEALTH PLAN BELIEVED IT WAS NOT MEDICALLY NECESSARY. YOUR DOCTOR THE CONSUMERS DOCTOR AND HEALTH PLANS MEDICAL DIRECTOR PRESENTED OPPOSING MEDICAL OPINION ON THE CONSUMERS CONDITION AND APPROPRIATE TREATMENT ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE NOT FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE RELEVANT MEDICAL LITERATURE AND UNSURE OF WHICH DOCTOR TO SIDE WITH DECIDED TO STAY THE HEARING IN ASK THE CONSUMER TO CONSULT THE THIRD SPECIALIST AS A TIE BREAKER THE CONSUMER ULTIMATELY GOT HIS MEDICATION BUT THE HEARING PROCESS TOOK SIX MONTHS AND ADDED AN UNNECESSARY STRAIN TO THE HEALTH SYSTEM BY REQUIRING THE CONSUMER TO GO TO AN ADDITIONAL SPECIALTY CARE APPOINTMENT. IN A PLAN WITH I AM ARE THAT CONSUMERS APPEAL WOULD HAVE GONE STRAIGHT TO INDEPENDENT DOCTOR FOR IF YOU ACCESS TO INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW ENSURES THE CLINICIANS EVALUATE CLINICAL CRITERIA AND EVIDENCE AND MAKE CLINICAL DETERMINATIONS ACT MEDICAL NECESSITY NOT ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES WITHOUT CLINICAL TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES AND NON I AM MARK COUNTY PLANS DESERVE TO HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS OF ALL OF THE MEDICAL MANAGED CARE MEMBERS AND LEGAL SERVICES ACCOUNTING CALIFORNIA STRONGLY URGES. YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN NEXT. WITNESS BY. GOOD AFTERNOON CHEN MEMBERS WENT AWAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY PROUD SPONSORS OF AB THIRTEEN FIFTY FIVE WHICH WOULD EXTEND INDEPENDENT MEDICAL YOU OUR MEDIC HEALTH SERVICE AMOUNT BASED ON MEDICAL NECESSITY. ATTENTION ALL CURRENTLY ALL COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLAN ENROLLEES CAN APPEAL HEALTHCARE SERVICE AND NOW TO AN INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW DONE BY IMPARTIAL MEDICAL EXPERTS HOWEVER FROM THAT ACCOUNT. EMILY'S THIS DEPENDS ON WHERE THEY LIVE WHAT PLAN THERE AND WHAT SERVICE THEY'RE SEEKING HE SAID- IT. INDIVIDUALS DEVELOP A JONES HAVE ACCESS TO A STATE FAIR HEARING WHICH MAY MAKE SENSE FOR ELIGIBILITY CASES BUT NOT FOR MEDICAL NECESSITY DETERMINATIONS WHICH REQUIRED MEDICAL EXPERTISE. THISIS EVIDENT IN THE OUTCOME INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW IS MORE FAVORABLE TO CONSUMER BECAUSE OVER 60% OF THE TIME DECISIONS ARE RULED IN THE CONSUMER'S CARE VESUS LESS THAN DECISION. THE BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION ENERGY SUPPORT TO ENSURE MEDIC CAL MEMBERS HAVE THE SAME APPEAL RIGHT AND ACCESS TO MEDICALLY NECESSARY SERVICE. REGARDLESS OF PLAN TYPE THANK YOU.

I WANT TO THANK LARA FLYNN FOR ALL HER WORK ON THIS BILL AND- FOR. THE EXCELLENT COMPREHENSIVE- COMMITTEE REPORT SUMMARIZING THE LONG. TROUBLED HISTORY OF THE STATE OVERSIGHT- OVER OR NURSING HOMES. IN A RECENT ARTICLES. AND CALMATTERS AS WELL AS THE SACRAMENTO BEE. AND OTHERS I HAE HIGHLIGHTED THE WOEFULLY INADEQUATE CURRENT STATE LICENSING AND OVERSIGHT SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE. FOR NURSING HOME OWNERS AND OPERATORS- COMMITTEE REPORT SUMMARIZES THE STRING OF AUDITS THAT HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED AT THE FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS. AGAIN HIGHLIGHTING THE WOEFULLY INADEQUATE OVERSIGHT OVER THE QUALITY OF CARE BEING PROVIDED IN OUR NURSING HOMES AND WE SAW DURING THIS PANDEMIC THAT OUR NURSING HOME RESIDENTS ARE. AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE- NOT ONLY TO THE PANDEMIC- BUT TO- SO MANY OTHER. HEALTH CRISES HEALTH CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE. THE ARTISTS THAT ARE SUMMARIZED IN THE COMMUTER REPORTS. SUMMARIZE HOW NURSING HOMES FOR TOO LONG AND FOR A TO MANY I HAVE OPERATED WITH UNLICENSED OWNERS AND OPERATORS. AND THAT OWNERS OF THE CHAINS OF NURSING HOMES HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FACILITIES NEW HOW ARE NURSING HOMES DESPITE THEIR LENGTHY AND WELL DOCUMENTED HISTORY OF VIOLATIONS. WE NEED TO CHANGE THIS CERTAINLY BEFORE IT'S TIME FOR ALL OF US TO CONSIDER OUR NURSING HOME OPTIONS. AB FIFTY NO TWO WILL PERFORM THE OWNERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT OF SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. BY PROPOSING SEVERAL THINGS ONE REQUIRING OWNERS AND OPERATORS TO OBTAIN A LICENSE FROM V. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH BEFORE THEY ARE ABLE TO ACQUIRE OPERATE- NURSING HOMES. NOW THAT MAY SOUND OBVIOUS IT'S SOME OF YOU MAY BE BEAVAN WONDERING DOESN'T THAT ALREADY HAPPENED WELL IT DOESN'T. AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE ON THIS COMMITTEE UNDERSTANDS THAT THERE ARE CURRENTLY NURSING HOMES THAT ARE BEING OPERATED THAT ARE UNLICENSED. AND WE NEED IT WE NEED TO CORRECT THAT. THIS BILL WILL ALSO GIVE THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH STRONGER AUTHORITY TO DISQUALIFY OWNERS AND OPERATORS WHO DO NOT MEET SUITABILITY AND QUALIFICATION STANDARDS. AND LASTLY THIS BILL WILL PROHIBIT THE USE OF INTERIM MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS TO CIRCUMVENT THE MOST BASIC OF LICENSING REQUIREMENTS. TESTIFYING ON THIS BILL IN SUPPORT. IS IT TONY SHE COULD TELL. WITH THE CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM. AND WENDY YORK AND ELDER ABUSE ATTORNEY. THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR RESEARCHING WILL GO TO OUR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ON THE PHONE. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY PLEASE GO AHEAD. YES THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK MY NAME IS TONY CHICKEN TELL AND I'M THE SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY FOR CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM. WITH THE SPONSORS OF AB FIFTEEN OH TWO WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON ON THAT WE'VE HAD IN DECADES WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARTUCCI AND CHAIRPERSON WOULD FOR YOUR AUTHORSHIP AND CRITICAL SUPPORT IN LEADERSHIP. AS YOU ALL KNOW NURSING HOMES THAT HAD A PRETTY ROUGH TIME IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. MARKED BY ISOLATION UNDERSTAFFING AND DANGEROUS NEGLECT. RESIDENTS CUT OFF FROM VISITORS AGAIN LAST WEEK BY STATE ORDER ARE TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON THE ABILITY OF FACILITY OPERATORS TO PROVIDE ALL THE CARE THEY NEED LARGELY ON AN HONOR SYSTEM WITH NO OVERSIGHT. WHO ARE THE OPERATORS THAT RESIDENTS AND THEIR LOVED ONES ARE DEPENDING ON THE OPERATOR'S RECEIVING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF STATE MONEY. WELL THE GROWING NUMBER OF NURSING HOMES ARE RUN BY SQUATTERS THESE ARE ON REPORTED UNVETTED AND UNLICENSED OPERATORS. CALIFORNIA DISGRACEFUL OWNERSHIP APPROVAL SYSTEM. WAS EXPOSED BY A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT MEDIA STORIES IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE SYSTEM ALLOWS ANYONE TO TAKE OVER NURSING HOME APPLY FOR A LICENSE WHENEVER THEY FEEL LIKE GETTING AROUND TO IT. AND PROVIDE CARE TO THOUSANDS OF AUDIBLE RESIDENTS ALL WHILE THE STATE APPROVAL IS PENDING OR EVEN WORSE AFTER THEIR APPLICATION HAS BEEN DENIED. THE DISINTEGRATION OF THIS LICENSE SYSTEM INVITES OPERATORS WHO PUT GREED OVER CARE. FACILITIES RUN BY SQUATTERS ARE NOT JUST RUN OF THE MILL THAT OPERATORS THEY ARE ALMOST INVARIABLY THE WORST OPERATORS. THAT WERE STAFFING MORE DEFICIENCIES. AND LOWER GOVERNMENT RATINGS. THE SQUATTERS TAKE CARE OF MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE POOR AND OF COLOR. AND UNSURPRISINGLY SQUATTER FACILITIES HAVE HAD SOME OF THE WORST COVERT NINETEEN OUTBREAKS IN THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF COVERT DEATHS NEEDED REFORM IN THREE PARTS. PART ONE WILL FINALLY AND IT NURSING ON SQUATTING BY CLARIFYING THAT OPERATORS HAVE TO HAVE APPROVAL BEFORE THEY START TAKING CARE OF RESIDENTS. PART TWO OF AB FIFTEEN OH TWO WILL RAMP UP THE STATE'S SUITABILITY STANDARDS FOR PSUITABILITY STANDARDS ARE LEADING TO SITUATIONS LIKE THAT AT HEALDSBURG SENIOR LIVING IN SONOMA COUNTY. A NURSING HOME THAT HAS HAD TERRIBLE INSTANCES OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT AND WAS RECENTLY DECERTIFIED. NOW THE FACILITIES REMAINING RESIDENTS ARE ON THE PRECIPICE OF DISASTER STRONG ENFORCEMENT MEASURES TO CRACK DOWN ON SQUATTERS AND THAT BAD OPERATORS KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA IS NO LONGER OPEN FOR THEIR KIND OF BUSINESS. AB FIFTEEN OR TO REST ON A SIMPLE PREMISE. GOOD OPERATORS RUN GARDNER GOOD NURSING HOMES AND THAT OPERATORS SHOULD GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO APPROVE AB FIFTEEN OH TWO. BECAUSE IT WILL DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE NURSING HOME QUALITY FOR THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS EVERY YEAR THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS WENDY YORK AND I AM A CIVIL LITIGATOR WHOSE PRACTICE IN THE AREA AND ELDER NEGLECT AND ABUSE IN NURSING HOMES FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS I AM OFFERING TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF AB FIFTEEN OH TWO AND KNOW FIRST HAND THAT THE TYPES OF- KEREN CONTACT- THAT OCCURS WHEN YOU'RE SEEN HOME OWNERS ARE ALLOWED TO OPERATE NURSING HOMES WITHOUT A LICENSE. I REPRESENT MULTIPLE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES WHOSE LOVED ONES DIED AT A NORTHERN CALIFORNIA NURSING HOMES THAT IS BEING OPERATED TODAY BY AN OWNER OPERATOR WHO WAS DENIED DENIED A LICENSE TO OPERATE THIS FACILITY FOR YEARS AGO I'M HERE TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT CAN HAPPEN IF CALIFORNIA ALLOWS UNLICENSED NURSING HOME OWNERS AND OPERATORS TO OPERATE NURSING HOMES IN OUR STATE. IN THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE NURSING HOME RESIDENTS DIED AT WINDSOR READING CARE CENTER. DISABILITY IS BEING OPERATED BY THE LARGEST FOR PROFIT NURSING HOME OWNER OPERATOR IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THERE WERE WARNING SIGNS THAT THE TWENTY FIVE DESK WE'RE GOING TO OCCUR. FOUR YEARS EARLIER WHEN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TONIGHT THIS IS- OWNER OPERATOR LICENSE IT STATED THAT THE REASON IT WAS DENYING THAT THE OWNER OPERATOR LICENSE WAS DUE TO ITS PRIOR HISTORY. OF VIOLATING- HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATIONS AND OTHER SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES WHICH INCLUDED TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE FEDERAL REGULATORY VIOLATIONS IN JUST THREE YEARS WORSE WHEN IT'S NURSING HOME OPERATOR PURCHASED THE FACILITY YET. DID NOT GET A LICENSE AND OPERATED WHEN YOU'RE READY CARE CENTER THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH SUBSTANTIATED AN ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO COMPLAINTS SIXTY ONE OF WHICH INVOLVED NEGLECT AND ABUSE FIVE OF WHICH INVOLVED INFECTION CONTROL ISSUES. IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY THE CALIFORNIA DPH CONDUCTED A CO THEY NINETEEN INSPECTION OF THE FACILITY AND FOUND THAT IT WAS NOT COMPLIANT AS THE FACILITY WAS NOT TESTING RESIDENTS WERE COMING FROM HOSPITALS AND STAFF WERE NOT WEARING THEIR APPROPRIATE PP EQUIPMENT. IN AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY A MONTH LATER THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH CONDUCTED ANOTHER CODE NINETEEN FOCUSED INFECTION CONTROL INSPECTION OF THE FACILITY AND AGAIN FOUND IT DID I'M LICENSE OWNER OPERATOR WOULD NOT COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS. RELATED TO INFECTION CONTROL- BIKE THAT CAN CON. CORONA RESIDENTS THAT WERE CONTRACTED- THE COSBY NINETEEN WERE MOVED TO THE FACILITY TO READ DOWN THE TO READ SOMEONE AND- STAFFED- DIGI KEY AND PATIENTS WERE NOT GETTING ASSIGNED STAFF TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. NURSING STAFF DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD SYSTEM. DOCTORS WERE NOT BEING NOTIFIED OF THE PATIENTS CHANGES IN CONDITIONS. THERE WERE EIGHTY FOUR SHIPS WERE THE NURSES DID NOT CONDUCT COVERT ASSESSMENTS AT ALL. ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY FIFTH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH CONDUCTED ANOTHER CO THAT NINETEEN AN INSPECTION. THIS DIDN'T THIS TIME DECLARING THAT THIS NURSING HOME WAS- IN VIOLATION OF INFECTION CONTROL AND THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE JEOPARDY WHICH MEANS THE REGULATORS DETERMINED THAT THE VIOLATIONS COULD CAUSE INJURY OR DEATH. SO LET ME TO PATIENTS WHO EXPERIENCED THIS PERSON. AND MY HEART AND THE HEART HERSELF WORKED IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY FOR FORTY YEARS SHE STARTED AS A CNA. PUT HERSELF THROUGH COLLEGE AND BECAME AN LPN WORKED IN NURSING HOMES. FOR ANOTHER THIRTY YEARS AFTER AND RETIRED SHE HAD A STROKE AND SHE WAS ADMITTED TO WINTER READING CARE CENTER. BUT AND THEN HER FAMILY BEFORE THE PANDEMIC SAW THAT THERE WERE CRACKS AND HOW THIS NURSING HOME WAS BEING OPERATED BY THIS OPERATOR SHE WAS LEFT- LAYING IN HER FECES AND URINE FOR HOURS WHILE HER CALL LIGHT WILL NOT RESPONDED TO SHE WAS LEFT IN HER BED- ALLOWED TO. DEVELOP A LARGE PRESSURES ARE ON HER BOTTOM FROM MS PERSPECTIVE THIS NURSING HOME WAS UNDERSTAFFED AND STAFF ARE NOT BEING TRAINED BUT SHE TRIED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. FROM WITHIN AS A PATIENT SHE MAKE CALLS TO THE OMBUDSMAN'S OFFICE HE MADE CALLS THE DEPARTMENT OF KUMBLE. DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. IN SEPTEMBER OF TWO TWENTY. AND I WAS EXPOSED TO. AND TESTED. AND I WOULD MOVE TO THE RED ZONE THREE DAYS AFTER SHE WAS ALREADY POSITIVE WITH OF THE NINETEEN MANY OTHER NON. OTHER TIONS WERE BEING EXPOSED TO CO THE NINETEEN. AND THEN. REMAINED IN THE RED ZONE FOR FIVE DAYS WHERE SHE RECEIVED NO NURSING ASSESSMENT AFTER BEING DIAGNOSED WITH OTHER NINETEEN SHOULD TRANSFER TO THE HOSPITAL WHERE SHE WAS INTIMATED INTEGRATED AND PUT INTO ISOLATION SHE DIED ON OCTOBER FIRST ALONE. AND I WAS THE MOTHER OF TWO DAUGHTERS AND FOUR GRANDCHILDREN AND SURVIVED BY THREE SISTERS. ANOTHER ONE OF WINTER READING- NURSING PATIENT HOME PATIENTS WITH ART TRENARY AND ARE HIS WIFE WHO HAD HAD EIGHT CHILDREN THAT THEY RAISED OUTSIDE OF READING. AND AFTER A STROKE ART WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE SAME WINTER READING CARE FACILITY. BUT BEFORE HIS FAMILY MOVED ARE INTO THIS NURSING FACILITY THEY CALL THE FACILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FACILITY HAD NO BECAUSE THEY CASES. WHEN THEY ASKED IF THERE WAS ANY BECAUSE THE CASES THIS IS A LEE TOLD THEM THERE WERE NONE BUT IN TRUTH THEIR WORK. AND TO THE FACILITY IN THE FAMILY UNFORTUNATELY MOVED. INTO THE FACILITY HE WAS TESTED POSITIVE FOR COCAINE ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY FIFTH AND THEN THE NEXT SIX DAYS. THE FACILITY DID NOT PERFORM ANY NURSING ASSESSMENT FOR HIS CO THE NINETEEN HE. DIED ON OCTOBER FOURTH. WE CAN TURN THIS TRAGEDY INTO SOMETHING BY THE- POSITIVE BY MAKING SURE THAT UNLICENSED NURSING HOME OWNERS AND OPERATORS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO OWN FOR MANAGING NURSING HOMES IN CALIFORNIA. WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIFTEEN OH TWO FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE DO HAVE ONE REGISTER WITNESS IN OPPOSITION WHENEVER YOU'RE READY PLEASE GO AHEAD. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN PERSISTENTLY HEALTH COMMITTEE JENNIFER SNYDER. WHEN I'M SPEAKING TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES- WE REPRESENT THE MAJORITY OF THE ELEVEN HUNDRED STILL NURSING FACILITIES IN THE STATE. IF YOU KNOW TO A LET ME FIRST SAY THAT AND PASSAGE OF VERY MUCH APPRECIATIVE OF THE OPEN DIALOGUE WE HAD WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF. I WOULD STRONGLY AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS THAT THE CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP PROCESS FOR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES NEEDS TO BE REFORMED. WE ALSO AGREED THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH SHOULD HAVE THE NECESSARY TOOLS. INFORMATION ACCORDING TO DETERMINE IF A POTENTIAL OPERATOR IS BENEFICIAL TO CALIFORNIA AND WILL PROVIDE QUALITY PERRANCE LONG TERM CARE PATIENTS. CALIFORNIA WE UNDERSTAND THAT CALIFORNIA'S ACTUALLY ONLY STATE A NATION THAT AS A CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP PROCESS FOR NURSING FACILITIES WHEREBY. A POTENTIAL OWNER IS ASKED BY THE DEPARTMENT TO FIRST COMPLETE. THE TRANSACTION THE PROJECT. WITH THE KERN OPERATOR AND THEN IF THE POINTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AS THE INTERIM MANAGER. IS ONLY AFTER THE COST OF THE CURSE THE PUBLIC HEALTH THEN REFUSED A LICENSE APPLICATION. THE NEW MUST OPERATE WITHIN THE- OPERATING IT NUCLEAR WITHOUT AN APPROVED LICENSE AND WITHOUT DIRECT ACCESS TO. REIMBURSEMENT PAYMENTS FOR MONTHS IF NOT MULTIPLE YEARS. THE LICENSURE PROCESS IS BACKWARD AND IT'S AN APT AND IT NEEDS TO BE. CHANGED TO COMPLETE HER CAR PARTS YOU WANT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO FUTURE CONVERSATIONS ON THE BILL WE HOPE THAT WE CAN- WORK THROUGH SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE AT LEAST. THE WAY THAT YOU KNOWTO A CURRENTLY WRITTEN WRITTEN AND- THEY CAN BE KINDA NARROWED INTO THREE PARTICULAR POCKET ON THE FIRST. IS REALLY TO DETERMINE WHAT HAPPENS IF THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH DOESN'T DO THEIR JOB- WHAT STATE FORTY SIX MONTHS DOWN THE ROAD. AND A NEW OPERATOR DIDN'T TAKE OVER FACILITY ESPECIALLY FACILITY THAT STRUGGLING AND THE NEW OWNERS WAITING WHAT WE DO ABOUT THE SITUATION. AND TECHNICAL IS THERE ARE- EXTENSIVE DISCLOSURE EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN FIFTEEN MINUTES YOU. AND INFORMATION IN MANY CASES WITH GOVERNMENT HIGHER RELIC BOXES AND BOXES. IN OTHER CASES IT REQUIRES EVIDENCE CERTAIN EVIDENCE WITHOUT CLEAR GUIDANCE FOR HOW THAT EVIDENCE SHOULD BE QUANTIFIED IT JUSTIFIED. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR- NEW POTENTIAL OWNERS HAVE SOME CLEAR DIRECTION AS TO WHAT THEY NEED TO PROVIDE TO THE APARTMENT SO THEY CAN QUALIFY FOR OWNERSHIP. IN CALIFORNIA AND THIRTY LAST- THE WAY THAT CURRENT CURRENTLY THAT CONNECTION IS WRITTEN IT HAS CERTAIN PROHIBITIONS THAT. WOULD ACTUALLY- LIMON THE BILL FOR MOST CURRENT OWNERS IN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY APPLY OR EVEN APPLY FOR CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP AND THESE PROVISIONS DON'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHERE WE HAVE VERY COMPLEX OF REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS IN CALIFORNIA. NOR DID THEY LOOK AT- OWNERS THAT MIGHT HAVE MULTIPLE FACILITIES THAT THEY'RE. CURRENTLY RUNNING IN CALIFORNIA. SO I JUST WANNA AND BY SAYING CATCHES VERY MUCH COMMITTED TO SEEING A PART CHANGE- AND USING YOU KNOW AND TO DO TO THE VEHICLE THAT PART CHANGE.

VERY SIMILAR BELL AND I'M LOOKING AT THE ANALYSIS IN THAT. ACTUALLY IT'S HERE AND- THERE IS A BIG SERIES IN MY LOCAL NEWSPAPER ABOUT THIS. OPERATOR WHO YOU KNOW WAS IT DOING RIGHT BY SENIORS AND JUST REMIND PEOPLE WE HAVE A THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT TURNED FIFTY FIVE EVERY DAY IN CALIFORNIA. SO MORE AND MORE OF OUR LOVED ONES ARE GOING TO BE GOING THESE FACILITIES. AND- YOU KNOW I WAS SHOCKED SEVEN YEARS AGO THAT WHEN YOU CAME OUT OF AN OPERATOR. HAS A SHADY TRACK RECORD THEY TRY TO GET A NEW RESTAURANT A BAR THAT CARD CLUB THE STATE GOES AFTER YOU AND SAYS NOW. YOU GO AND GET MORE AND MORE- NURSING HOMES IN THIS OPERATOR FORGET HIS NAME- DON'T DISPARAGE ANYBODY BUT I CAN'T PRONOUNCE THE NAME BUT I THINK YOU KNOW THE SAME OPERATOR. THIS STILLMAN. SEVEN YEARS LATER AND PEOPLE ARE DYING. AT THE FACILITIES ITSELF I THINK THE EFFORT THAT I TRY TO DO IS A LITTLE STRONGER BUT THIS IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT I FULLY- CAN GET THAT AND MY SUPPORT BEHIND IN TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE PROTECT CONSUMERS. AND SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS UP THIS MEASURE IT TO DOCTOR WOULD FOR JOINING TO MAKE IT A REALITY THANKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS AGUIAR-CURRY. YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLYMEMBER FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I MEAN THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT IS FRUSTRATING. AND IT'S SHOCKING. AND WHEN I READ- THE ANALYSIS AND THINGS I JUST WAS REALLY EVEN MORE UPSET IN THE TESTIMONY TODAY REALLY HIT HOME. THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO IS PUT OUR LOVE ONES IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY AND NOT EXPECTING TO GET THE CARE THAT THEY ARE HAVING- HI MY TO MY UNDERSTAND YOUR CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BILL- THEN THAT'S VERY HELPFUL- ALSO- COULD YOU CLARIFY WHEN YOU COME BACK OR WHAT. IS THE WHAT THE- DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE INTERIM IT MANAGES OUR- WITH OUR- AUTHORIZED TO DO. AND THE MANAGEMENT COMPANIES OR WHAT THEY'RE AUTHORIZED TO DO AND THE OTHER THING IS. IS THAT I'M SHOCKED NOT STREAMLINING THIS. GRAHAM IT MAKES NERVOUS DON'T GIVE THE DEPARTMENT HELP ENOUGH MONEY TO DO THE STREAMLINING PROCESS AND THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER. A WHOLE NOTHER THING BUT THE PAST STILL DO THIS ON PAPER. IS REDICULOUS. AND HOW CAN ANYBODY GIVE GOOD SERVICE IF WE CANNOT ACCESS THE DATA. ON THESE EMPLOYEES SO I HOPE YOUBRING THAT BACK WHEN YOU HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS GOING FORWARD. AGAIN I'LL BE HERE TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. C.

MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW WE HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE HEARING ON THIS ISSUE IN OCTOBER A VERY EMOTIONAL HEARING- BY THE WAY. WE DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW SERIOUS THIS ISSUE REALLY IS AND HOW MUCH WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE TO REFORM THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY LICENSING PROCESS. WE HAVE A COMMITMENT. WE GOT IT THAT DAY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THAT THEY WILL ENGAGE WITH US ON THIS PROCESS AS IT MOVES FORWARD. AND WE WILL ABSOLUTELY HOLD ON TO THAT COMMITMENT I'M I'M EXPECTING THAT WE WILL GET TECHNICAL SUPPORT PRIOR TO THIS BILL BEING HEARD IN THE SENATE. AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IMPORTANT POINT HERE SO. I'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU- AND THE STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE A MORE STREAMLINED PROCESS- AND THAT PROTECTS OUR BILLABLE NURSING HOME RESIDENTS AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS- THE BILL DOESN'T ENJOY A DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YES AT THANK YOU.

THANK YOU MISTER MURATSUCHI- OUR NEXT BILL IS BY. SENATOR WIENER THE ONLY SENATE WE'RE HEARING TODAY. PLEASE COME ON UP. THE. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY SIR THANK CHAIRMAN FOR SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HEARING THIS BILL- IN JANUARY A VERY MUCH APPRECIATED OF ENJOYED WORKING WITH YOU- OVER THE LAST SIX OR NINE MONTHS ON THIS BILL AND HAVING SOME REALLY GREAT DIALOGUE NUMBER APPRECIATE IT FOR THE TIME. AND ENERGY THAT YOU PUT INTO THIS- BILL- AND- WE'RE HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND ANALYSIS OUR COLLEAGUES ARE SENATE BILL FIFTY SEVEN WHICH IS A BILL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN IN DIFFERENT ITERATIONS OVER THE YEARS- SOME VENISON REMEMBER- EGGMAN I INTRODUCED THIS BILL IN VARIOUS FORMS OVER TIME WITH DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS AS- AS PILOT PROGRAMS- BUT THE WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THIS. BILL HAS APPEARED IN DIFFERENT ITERATIONS OF THE HEART OF THE BILL IS ALWAYS THE SAME- IT'S ABOUT SAVING LIVES AND. AND SAVING PEOPLE FROM OVERDOSE. IF YOU HAVE ANY DEATHS HELP US TO ADDRESS WHAT IS A WORSENING. EPIDEMIC OF OVERDOSE DEATHS AND IT WILL DO SO BY GIVING SAN FRANCISCO- THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES AND OAKLAND THE LEGAL ABILITY- TO AUTHORIZE SAFE CONSUMPTION SITES. TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR AND I APOLOGIZE FOR MY VOICE. THREE CLEAR NO CITY CAN I HAVE HOLE IN ONE MOMENT. TO BE CLEAR BECAUSE THEY'RE CALLING IT WILL BE REQUIRED TO MOVE OUT. LIFE RATHER THAN AUTHORIZES THE PILOT PROGRAM IS YOUR. THE IT IS A LOCAL SCHOOL. THANKS FOR VISITING. THESE ARE THE A. THIRTY EACH OF THE FOUR JURIST HAS REQUEST TO BEING. WITH UNANIMOUS VOTES BY THE L. A. COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND THE OAKLAND CITY COUNCIL AND A FOURTEEN TO ONE VOTE BY THE LA CITY COUNCIL OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE DESPERATELY ASKING US FOR THIS TOOL. PLEASE SAFE CONSUMPTION SITES ARE PROGRAMS WHERE PEOPLE MAY USE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES UNDER THE SUPERVISION SUPERVISION OF STAFF WHO ARE TRAINED TO PREVENT AND TREAT OVERDOSES. SEVENTY SITES ALSO HELP DISTRIBUTE CLEANING SUPPLIES- TO PREVENT HIV AND HEPATITIS INFECTION- A HELP PEOPLE OUR TESTER DRUGS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY HAVE BEEN LACED WITH FENTANYL- AND THEY FACILITATE ENTRY INTO SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT AND OTHER SERVICES. CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF AN UNPRECEDENTED OVERDOSE CRISIS THAT IS AFFECTING FRANKLY THE WHOLE COUNTRY AND IT HAS TO BE TREATED AS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS- IN THE CONTEXT OF KUVIN NINETEEN WE KNOW THAT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. OVERDOSES AND OVERDOSE DEATHS HAVE GOTTEN WORSE- APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY OF THESE SAFE CONSUMPTION SITES EXIST CURRENTLY IN TEN COUNTRIES- AND THEY HAVE BEEN RIGOROUSLY RESEARCHED AND STUDIED. AND HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE HEALTH AND SAFETY PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH DRUG USE INCLUDING PUBLIC USE- TO REDUCE DISCARDED SYRINGES SYRINGES LETTER- AND TO REDUCE HIV AND HEPATITIS INFECTIONS AND OVERDOSE DEATHS. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A SINGLE RECORDED OVERDOSE DEATHS IN ANY OF THESE FACILITIES AROUND THE WORLD OVER A PERIOD OF DECADES NOT A SINGLE RECORDED OVER THE STUFF. OVER AN EIGHTEEN MONTH PERIOD- A STUDY THAT WAS CONDUCTED IN SIGHT IN VANCOUVER. THERE WERE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX OVERDOSES- IN THE AT THAT SAFE CONSUMPTION SITE NONE OF THEM FATAL THEY'RE ALL REVERSED HOW DOES HAPPEN ON THE STREETS. WE KNOW THAT A PERCENTAGE OF THOSE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE DIED AND THEY ARE ALIVE TODAY BECAUSE THEY WERE USING IN A SUPERVISED CONSUMPTION SITE. STUDIES ALSO SUGGEST THAT STATE CONSTRUCTION SITES REDUCE THE BURDEN ON EMERGENCY SERVICES BOTH AMBULANCES AND EMERGENCY ROOMS THAT TRADITIONALLY RESPOND TO OVERDOSES. THIS REDUCES STRESS ON WHAT WE KNOW IS AN UNBELIEVABLY STRESSED EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM- IN AN EVALUATION OF AN UNSANCTIONED SAFE CONSUMPTION SITE IN THE UNITED STATES PUBLISHED LAST YEAR. NOT A SINGLE PERSON WHO POST- WAS TRANSFERRED TO AN OUTSIDE MEDICAL INSTITUTION THEY WERE ABLE TO DEAL WITH IT THERE AND RELIEVE THAT STRESS ON OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. ADDITIONALLY THERE'S NO INCREASE IN CRIME OR VIOLENCE OR DRUG TRAFFICKING IN THE AREAS AROUND THESE PROGRAMS. A STUDY PUBLISHED LAST YEAR EXAMINING- THE SAME UNSANCTIONED SITE IN THE US ACTUALLY DOCUMENTED THE CRIMINAL ACTIVITY DECREASED RATHER THAN INCREASED IN THE AREA AROUND THE CITY CONSUMPTION SITE. AND STUFF STUDIES SHOW A REDUCE REDUCTION IN SYRINGE LETTER- AND INJECTION RELATED LITTER IN GENERAL- TOMORROW A NEW PEER REVIEWED EVALUATION OF AN UN SANCTIONS SAFE CONSUMPTION SITE- WILL BE PUBLISHED THAT'S TOMORROW- I. AM NOT AT LIBERTY TO PUBLICLY SAY WHAT THE RESULTS ARE BUT WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE RECEIVE THOSE THAT INFORMATION- IF THE RESULTS ARE VERY VERY PROMISING- ADDICTION TREATMENT ORGANIZATIONS AND THE PHYSICIANS WHO TREAT ADDICTION. OR SUPPORT THIS BUT- BECAUSE KNOW THAT IT INCREASE ACTS TO RECOVERY AND SAVE LIVES. SINCE SB FIFTY SEVEN SINCE I INTRODUCED THIS BILL LAST YEAR I WROTE ISLANDS HAS PASSED LEGISLATION AUTHORIZING SAFE CONSUMPTION SITES. I'M THE FIRST TO- PUBLICLY KNOWN SAFE CONSUMPTION SITES IN NEW YORK CITY I RECENTLY OPENED AND IN THE FIRST THREE WEEKS THAT THEY WERE OPEN- FIFTY NINE OVERDOSES WERE REGION WERE REVERSED- THE SITES ALSO SAVE MONEY- AND THAT HAS ALSO BEEN THE RESULT OF A STUDIES IN TERMS OF FEWER PEOPLE IN AMBULANCES AND YARS. I'M TO BE CLEAR THIS BILL DOES ENSURE THAT BOTH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE BY REQUIRING A PUBLIC HEARING BEFORE THE CITY OXEN- INCLUDING THESE INVOICES. THE BILL SUNSETS IN SIX YEARS AND UNDER THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS TO PARTICIPATING JURISDICTIONS WILL BE REQUIRED. TO PRODUCE A PEER REVIEWED STUDY IDOLIZING THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE SITES. OUR COLLEAGUE THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY DRUG TREATMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE. AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG PROGRAM EXECUTIVES- IT IS A- BILL WHOSE TIME HAS COME AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. I TESTIFYING TODAY R.

OVER THE YEARS AND ALL HEALTHCARE SERVICES MUST ACCORDING BOBBY SCIENCE. TREATMENT IS EFFECTIVE BUT IT IS NOT AFFECTED THE SAME FOR EVERYONE. AND FOR THOSE FOR WHOM WE HAVE NOT SUCCESSFULLY REACHED WE NEED TO BE WILLING TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY. NO LESS THAN DR NORA VOLKOW HEAD OF NIGHT AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DRUG ABUSE.

PLEASE VOTE YES. REPORT SB FIFTY SEVEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE DO HAVE TO REGISTERED WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ACTED LIKE TO. COME FORWARD. PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE CHAIRED A COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THIS TIME MY NAME IS TACK ALLEN AND I AM THE PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL FAITH BASED COALITION AS WELL AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE CONGRESS OF RACIAL EQUALITY. THIS BILL HAVE EVOLVED SINCE ITS INTRODUCTION. BUT STILL FALLS FLAT IN SPACES THAT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COUNT THE MOST. IT ALSO ADDS THROUGH AND PERMITS THE PERFECT PERPETUATION OF PROBLEMS. COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. SHOVEL WITH WHILE TAKING A SERVICE LEVEL APPROACH TO RESOURCING. THAT SOUNDS BETTER IN THEORY. BUT WILL HAVE HARMFUL BY PRODUCTS. AND MINIMAL MITIGATION PRACTICE. CHIU HARM REDUCTION IS NOT AS SIMPLE AS MAKING A SAFE SPACE UTILIZED DRUGS IN A FACILITY TO ASSURE SAFETY. FROM OVERDOSE. IT CONSIST OF ACTIONABLE FOR. SUCH AS ON SITE COUNSELORS AND REQUISITE TO THE SERVICES. I'VE BEEN SERVING OF MY LIFE WITNESSING. MY FATHER THE LATE BISHOP RON ALLEN BATTLING ADDICTION TO CRACK COCAINE. IN THE MOMENTS HE FELT. HE ADMITTED. THERE IS NO WAITING FOR THE NEXT TIME THE SEARCHES INSTEAD. AS SOON AS YOU GET THAT FIRST ONE YOU NEED ANOTHER AND THEN ANOTHER AND ANOTHER. HE WAS PUT UNDER THE CARE OF ONE OF HIS FRIENDS TO SUPERVISE ALTHOUGH THE PASTOR THAT WAS SUPERVISED HIM HIS CONSUMPTION AND GIVE HIM EDUCATION INFORMATION THAT WOULD HELP HIM TO GET HIS USAGE THIS ATTEMPT ALSO FELT. IT WASN'T UNTIL HE WAS PUT INTO ROBUST COUNSELING AND REHABILITATION PROGRAMS HE MAY HAVE JUST BEEN DUE FOR THE CYCLE OF ADDICTION FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE THE REST OF MY LIFE KNOWING HIM. INSTEAD HE LIVED TWENTY EIGHT YEARS CLEAN AND SOBER THIS OPPORTUNITY SHOULD BE AFFORDED TO EVERYONE IN THE STATE. FURTHERMORE THIS BILL SEEMS TO HAVE INTENTIONALLY OVERLOOKED THE UNINTENDED HARMS TRUST FUND RIGHT OUTSIDE OF THE DOORS OF SINNERS IN THE OTHER COUNTRIES. NOTICE THE PROVIDE KEEP SPECIFY METRICS WITHIN THE FACILITY. STUDIES FROM BOTH THE NETHERLANDS CANADA BOTH VANCOUVER AND ALBERTA GRADUALLY HAVE SHOWN A STRUGGLE WITH OVERDOSES THAT TAKE PLACE DIRECTLY OUTSIDE OF THE SAME PROPERTY OF SITE. DEREK THE INTERVENTION FROM MY MEDICAL. THESE OVER GO BOTH REPORTER AND ENTRY BY PEOPLE WITHIN THE CENTERS AND STUDIES AT THE PORT OF SUCH SITES. DO NOT OUTLINES OVERDOSES BECAUSE THEY ARE TOTALLY FOCUSED ON OUTCOMES ONLY WITHIN THE WALLS OF THOSE SYSTEMS. NOT THE BY PRODUCT OF THE FINISHED TESTIFYING RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR. THIS IS WHY STUDIES IN SUPPORT ONLY SUGGEST THIS COULD TAKE STRESS OFF OF RESPONDENTS. NOT CONFIDENTLY. ADDITION OF THE BATTLE WITH INSTANT GRATIFICATION AND THE YOUNG FOR IT. USERS SIMPLY USE OUTDOORS AND DO NOT FALL WITHIN THE REALM OF METRICS TAKEN WITHIN THE CENTERS. ONCE THEY HAVE DONE SO. WE CANNOT IGNORE THE FACT DRAW MORE USERS WHO DO ENGAGE IN DRUG CONSUMPTION AND UTILIZATION RIGHT OUTSIDE. WHILE CREATING MORE WASTE WITH SYRINGES LARGER CALL THE NINETEENTH ONE NUMBERS OF ALL POTENTIAL ISSUES FOR NEIGHBOURS AND HABITS INTO ACCOUNT IN YOUR LETTER. WE ALSO CANNOT IGNORE THE COMMUNITY SIMPLY DO NOT WANT FACILITIES OF THE STORE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS. MOST THAT IS IN FAVOR OF THE STAFF OUTLINED IN THE COMPLAINTS WHICH ALSO BRINGS CONCERNS ABOUT FIVE. MINUTES IS. TO DO SOMETHING OF THIS SORT ALREADY STRUGGLING COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE. A I URGE A. M. OPPOSITION VOTE FOR THIS AS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ALREADY STRUGGLE WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL IS NOT NECESSARILY ADDRESSING THE UNDERLYING BEHAVIORAL CAUSES THAT LEAD TO SUBSTANCE ABUSE BUT IT'S ALSO NOT REQUIRING THAT EACH PERSON THAT ENTERS THE CENTER'S UTILIZES PROPER TREATMENT COUNSELING REHABILITATION SERVICES NOR ARE THE METRICS REVOLVED AROUND OR DISCLOSING IN FULL THAT THERE ARE ISSUES OUTSIDE THE DOORS OF THE CENTERS THAT ARE NOT AN ACCOUNT OF FOR. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE HAVE ANOTHER WITNESS OF CENSORSHIP CAN HELP MOVE THE MICROPHONE DOWN IF YOU NEED TO OUR- THE NEW YORK HERE. NOW HIT HIM OF IT FOR HELPING ON THEIR SOMETHING CAN'T TOUCH IT. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JOHN LEVEL AND I'M TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NARCOTIC OFFICERS ASSOCIATION. THE COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY CHIEFS AS WELL AS THE- CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS- FIRST OF ALL I'D BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T- COMMENT ON THE ANALYSIS THAT WAS DONE BY MISS BABCOCK. TRULY AN EXCELLENT PIECE OF WORK- IT JESS UNRUH IS A FAMILY FRIEND OF OURS AND HE USED TO TALK ABOUT THE INCREDIBLE STAFF THAT WOULD COME WITH A FULL TIME- LEGISLATURE. HE CLEARLY HAD THAT KIND OF WORK IN MIND IS JUST EXCEPTIONAL- THE TO ARREST ANYONE OR PUT THEM IN JAIL THAT'S A FALSE DICHOTOMY WE OPPOSE THIS BILL BECAUSE THE PREMISE OF THIS BILL IS FACTUALLY INACCURATE. OF THE HOUSE- FOR EXAMPLE. IN VANCOUVER OF THE IN THE LAST EIGHTEEN YEARS. THE INCREASE INCREASE NOT DECREASE INCREASE IN- OVERDOSE DEATHS 1000% IN ALBERTA PROVINCE INCREASE IN OVERDOSE DEATHS 65% IN- OF THE NETHERLANDS INCREASE IN TWO SEPARATE- LUMPS THE FIRST IN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OR SO DOUBLE OVERDOSE DEATHS IN IN THE SECOND TEN YEARS DOUBLED AGAIN- AND- NORWAY. THERE REALLY WASN'T MUCH OF A CHANGE IN OVERDOSE DEATHS BUT YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER THAT EVEN THAT IS BECAUSE NORWAY HAS THE LARGEST PERCENTAGE OF OVERDOSE DEATHS IN ALL OF- WESTERN EUROPE- SIMILARLY IN FRANKFORT GERMANY. INCREASE IN OVERDOSE DEATHS IT'S AND HERE'S WHY THE REASON IS THAT MOST PEOPLE DO NOT USE THE- MOST MOST PEOPLE DO NOT USE THE INJECTION SITE ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS THAT NUMBER FOR EXAMPLE IN CANADA IS ONLY FIVE PERCENT. BUT YOU GET A MAGNET AFFECT OR OTHER PEOPLE WITH THIS ADDICTION COME IN AND THEY USE IT OUTSIDE AND THAT'S WHERE THE DEATHS GO P THERE IS NO STRATEGY FOR GETTING PEOPLE INTO THE OF THE CENTERS KIND OF THING ONE FINAL NOTE AND VERY PROPER REFERENCE TO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO WITH THE COVERT NINETEEN -- EPIDEMIC OR PANDEMIC NOW IN THIS HEARING IS THERE ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM WHO BELIEVES THAT THOSE SAME

COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MISS KOREA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING YET AGAIN THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT BILL ACROSS THE LEGISLATURE REMEMBER COMING INTO OFFICE AND WORKING WITH NOW SENATOR EGGMAN ON THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION THE IMPORTANCE OF LOOKING AT DRUG ADDICTION THROUGH A VERY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE FOR CONTINUING THAT WORK IN PROUD TO ALSO BE A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL NOW MULTIPLE TIMES NOW IS WE TRY TO GET IT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK -- I'M GLAD THAT IT'S -- REGIONAL APPROACH IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE MOST -- -- COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE THAT HAVE SEEN A DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF FOLKS THAT HAVE -- BEEN SEVERELY IMPACTED BY DRUG ADDICTION AND ARE CURRENTLY PART OF OUR ON HOUSE TO POPULATION IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES WHICH I REPRESENT I'VE SPOKEN TO MANY PEOPLE THAT WORK DIRECTLY WITH FOLKS -- THAT NEED SERVICES THAT SAY WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO DO THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND EXPECTING DIFFERENT RESULT OF MANY FOLKS THAT I'VE CONNECTED TO IN THE PAST FEW YEARS I HAVE SAID IF ONLY THERE WAS A SPACE RIGHT I KNOW THAT I NEED SUPPORT AND I NEED HELP AS I TRY TO GET OFF SOME KIND OF SUBSTANCE OR SEEK ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE AND I THINK THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO TO THINK ABOUT WELLNESS HEALTH WELLNESS AND DRUG ADDICTION HOW WE HELP COMMUNITIES THAT NEED SUPPORT AND PEOPLE THAT NEED SUPPORT ULTIMATELY TO CREATE A DIFFERENT SPACE IN WHICH -- THEY ARE ABLE TO DO SO -- AND THERE IS THIS BILL DOES HAVE A SUNSET SO IT ALLOWS FOR US TO BE ABLE TO SEE IF THIS WORKS AND HOPEFULLY IF IT DOES AND I'M I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT IT WILL THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SAVE LIVES IN THE PROCESS AND I KNOW THAT IT IS CHALLENGING AND DIFFICULT I TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT WHAT THIS COULD POTENTIALLY LOOK LIKE FOR SOCIETY BUT WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO DO THE SAME AND EXPECT A DIFFERENT RESULT AND SO I'M I'M GLAD TO BE SUPPORTIVE I'M GLAD TO BE A CO AUTHOR AND THANK YOU FOR CONTINUING THIS WORK MISTER GERRY CURRY YEAH THANK YOU CENTER FOR BRINGING THIS -- AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT YOU LIMITED TO THE THREE MAJOR CITIES THAT HAVE AGREED TO GO FORWARD WITH THIS -- I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE BEING A COUNCIL MEMBER OR A BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THERE WITHOUT HAVING SOMEBODY HAVE MY BACK AND TRY TO MAKE THE TRY TO LOOK AT THAT THIS AT A DIFFERENT ANGLE WITH A DIFFERENT VIEW AND I THINK WE NEED TO GIVE IT A SHOT AND I THINK THAT THE -- THE COMMUNITIES THERE WERE SHOULD BE GRATEFUL THAT WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK AT THIS DIFFERENTLY I KNOW YOU'VE HAD A TOUGH TIME WITH THIS ONE BUT I WANT TO I'M LENDING YOU MY SUPPORT I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL TODAY BECAUSE I THINK OF THIS WORKS IN THE WORLD TO SEE THAT IT CAN WORK -- I HAVE BEEN -- I WENT TO ANOTHER COUNTRY THIS YEAR BUT I SAW SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR AND I WAS SHOCKED HOW WELL IT WORKS AND WE HAVE TO STOP SAYING IT WON'T IT WON'T LET'S GIVE IT A SHOT AND SINGING OUT WILL ALSO BEGIN I THINK ON THIS GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THIS OF THE A DIFFERENT POVERTY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING AFFORD THANK IN ANYONE ELSE I WOULD JUST -- I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU CENTER WINNER AND I AND I APPRECIATE YOU BEING A LITTLE PATIENT WITH ME ON THIS IT'S TAKEN ME A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TOGETHER TO DO MY PROCESS AND GATHER INFORMATION I WOULD NOTE THAT OVERDOSE DEATHS IN THIS COUNTRY OR IN AN ALL TIME HIGH -- REGARDLESS OF WHERE WE ARE AND IT'S CURRENTLY VERY ACUTE IN LARGE URBAN AREAS LIKE THAT THAT THAT YOU REPRESENT BUT IT IS ALSO HAVING SOME OF THE COUNTIES THAT HAVE THE LARGEST PER CAPITA OVERDOSE DEATHS -- IT I FIND IT A CUTELY REALLY PROBLEMATIC AS WELL SO RECOGNIZING THAT -- HE THE CURRENT APPROACHES ARE NOT COMPLETELY WORKING FOR EVERYONE YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE LOOK AT SOMETHING THAT FOR SOME PEOPLE SEEMS COUNTER INTUITIVE -- AND AND I UNDERSTAND MY RECOLLECTION FROM -- SENATE WENT NOW CENTER EGGMAN WAS THAT IN VANCOUVER SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR PEOPLE TO COME IN IT TAKES TIME FOR PEOPLE TO BUILD TRUST AND AND TO GET THOSE SUPPORT SERVICES THAT THEY NEED THEY NEED TIME TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT I BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS CREATE THAT SAFE ENVIRONMENT AND GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE FAITH THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE THERE TO SUPPORT THEM AND WHEN THEY DO THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO RECOVER FROM THEIR ADDICTION AND SO I I THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS -- AND A MOTION MOTION FOR MISTER IS ARIANNA SECOND FROM MISS CARILLO EMOTION DO PASS AS AMENDED TO PUBLIC SAFETY BUT I'D LIKE TO COMMUNICATE CLOSE THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COLLEAGUES AND I DO I I MENTIONED CENTER EGGMAN EARLY ON BUT I REALLY WANNA TO TO CENTER AND MEN WHO SHE FIRST INTRODUCES BILL IN TWENTY FIFTEEN BEFORE I AND MANY MEMBERS HERE OR EVEN MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE SOME OF YOU WERE I KNOW AND SOME OF US WARRANT SHE -- WENT THROUGH THREE DIFFERENT LEGISLATIVE TO YOUR SESSIONS WITH THIS BILL THE FIRST TIME I THINK I BELIEVE IT DID NOT MAKE IT OUT OF THE SINGLE COMMITTEE AND THAT EVERY TIME A GAIN MORE TRACTION -- AND SO SHE'S JUST DONE AMAZING WORK AND SHOW THAT THIS COULD GET SUPPORT NUMBER GRATEFUL FOR HER PARTNERSHIP AND COLLABORATION -- YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME IS AN ATTITUDE THAT IF YOU HAVE THE SAFETY CONSUMPTION SITES PEOPLE WHO AREN'T USING DRUGS ARE GOING TO BE USING DRUGS AND WE KNOW THAT THAT'S JUST NOT HOW IT WORKS PEOPLE ARE USING DRUGS NOW ARE DYING NOW -- AND THEY'RE DOING IT ALL TOO FREQUENTLY ON OUR STREETS I'M IMPACTING THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY AND IN A VERY UNHEALTHY SETTING AND IF WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP BRING THEM INSIDE TO GIVE THEM SUPPORT AND -- WE HOPE GET THEM INTO RECOVERY AND CERTAINLY SAVE THEIR LIVES WE ABSOLUTELY SHOULD DO THAT I THINK ALL TOO OFTEN IN THE SOCIETY WHEN IT COMES TO DRUG ADDICTION FULL SOCIETY VIEWS PEOPLE WHO ARE ADDICTED AS A THROW THROW AWAY PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO JUST DON'T MATTER AND IT'S NOT WORTH TRYING TO SAVE AND WE KNOW THAT SO MANY PEOPLE I KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE IN MY LIFE YOU HEARD FROM THIS GUY SEN WHO WAS IN AND WHO IS A HEROIN USER MANY YEARS AGO BEFORE SHE TURNED HER LIFE AROUND I KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TURN THEIR LIVES AROUND AFTER METH ADDICTION HEROIN ADDICTION AND WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO HELP THEM DO THAT SAFE CONSUMPTION SITES ARE PART OF THE SOLUTION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR WINNER OF THE BILL AS I SAID HAS A DO PASS AS AMENDED

FOURTEEN HUNDRED YEAH EVEN WITH ALL RIGHT IN THE AREA HI THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I WANT TO START BY THANKING YOU -- ASSEMBLY WOULD AND YOUR STAFF FOR THE TREMENDOUS WORK YOU PUT INTO THIS NOT JUST NOW BUT OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS -- AND I'M GREATLY APPRECIATIVE OF THAT ALMOST A YEAR AGO I INTRODUCED ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN HUNDRED I DID SO AFTER MUCH DEEP THOUGHT KNOWING THAT IT WOULD GARNER A LOT OF ATTENTION AND NOT ALL THE POSITIVE I ALSO KNEW THAT I WAS UNDERTAKING SOMETHING THAT HAVE BEEN TRIED AND FAILED MANY TIMES BEFORE SO WHY WOULD I ENTER INTO SUCH TREACHEROUS TERRITORY WHERE FAILURE IS THE MOST LIKELY OUTCOME I ENTERED INTO A LIFE OF PUBLIC SERVICE ARE ONE REASON ABOVE ALL ELSE TO REDUCE SUFFERING AND THE REALITY IS THAT IN OUR STATE AND OUR NATION WE HAVE A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT AS FAR AS FAR TOO MUCH SUFFERING EMBEDDED INTO IT PARTICULARLY HERE IN THE WEALTHIEST STATE IN THE WEALTHIEST NATION ON EARTH GIVEN THE RESPONSIBILITY GIVEN TO ME BY THE VOTERS I COULD NOT LIVE WITH MYSELF IF I DO NOT DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO ADDRESS THESE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM NOW THIS IS NOT TO SUGGEST THAT THE CHAIR FOR OTHER ESTEEMED MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE HAS CHOSEN TO IGNORE SOME SUFFERING QUITE TO THE CONTRARY IN FACT JUST YESTERDAY WE SAW AN EXPANSION OF HEALTH CARE ACCESS WHEN A DOCTOR ARAMBULA HAS WORKED ON FOR MANY MANY YEARS THAT WILL FURTHER HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR STRUCTURAL CHANGE THE CHAIR SPECIFICALLY HAS BEEN ENGAGED ON HEALTHCARE AFFORDABILITY ENHANCE OUR HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE USING NURSE PRACTITIONERS HAS WORKED TO SET UP A ROBUST DATA COLLECTION WITHIN ALL PAIRS DATABASE TO BE ONLINE IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND MUCH MUCH MORE A NUMBER OF THESE EFFORTS ISRAELI WERE OPPOSED BY THE SAME GROUPS THAT OPPOSE A BEFORE TWO HUNDRED BECAUSE IT IS A LOT EASIER FOR SOME TO SUPPORT A STATUS QUO THEY BENEFIT FROM THEN TO CHANGE FOR THE BENEFIT OF OTHERS WHAT IS THE STATUS QUO AND WHY IF AT ALL DOES IT NEED TO CHANGE WHILE ALMOST TWENTY PERCENT OF OUR NATION'S GDP IS RELATED TO HEALTH CARE SPENDING IN A TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE STUDY OVER HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S WERE WORRIED ABOUT UNEXPECTED MEDICAL BILLS IN OUT OF POCKET COSTS AND MORE CALIFORNIANS WERE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR MONTHLY HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUM THAN THEIR RENT OR MORTGAGE AND WHY IS THAT WELL HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS HAVE GONE UP FORTY SEVEN PERCENT SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN FAR OUTPACING WAGES OR INFLATION THAT EQUATES TO THE AVERAGE COST OF FAMILY PREMIUMS FOR EMPLOYER SPONSORED HEALTH CARE HEALTH PREMIUMS EXCEEDING TWENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR BUT WORKERS PAYING FOR ABOUT SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS OF THAT TAB THIS IS AN UNSUSTAINABLE BURDEN ON WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS AND THAT'S JUST THE PREMIUMS THE AVERAGE DEDUCTIBLE IS GOT NINETY TWO PERCENT OVER THE PAST DECADE NOW IT OVER SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR INDIVIDUALS THOSE WORKING FOR COMPANIES OF LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED EMPLOYEES AVERAGE ALMOST TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED AND UNDATEABLES A THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE THAN THOSE IN LARGER COMPANIES AND THIS ALL APPLIES IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE EMPLOYED AND HAVE EMPLOYER COVERAGE IF YOU'RE NOT EMPLOYED OR HAVE TO SELF INSURE YOUR SITUATION IS EVEN MORE DIRE IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE PAYING FOR INSURANCE AND PURCHASE THE BRONZE PLAN ON THE COVER CALIFORNIA EXCHANGE YOUR FAMILY DEDUCTIBLE IS SIXTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR EIGHTY TWO HUNDRED IF YOU'RE SINGLE AND BY THE WAY THIRTY PERCENT OF COVERED CALIFORNIA ENROLLEES AND TWENTY TWENTY HAD THE BRONZE PLAN I NEARLY THREE POINT TWO MILLION CALIFORNIANS ARE ALMOST TEN PERCENT OF THE POPULATION UNDER SIXTY FIVE WILL REMAIN UNINSURED IN TWENTY TWENTY TO NOW IF ONE WERE TO ASK ME IF I'M HAPPY ABOUT GOVERNOR'S SOME SPENDING MEDICARE OUT ALL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS BY PROGRESS POSSIBLE ABSOLUTELY YES FIRST IT INCREASES STATE INVESTMENT IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM BY TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THAT'S TO TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS LESS WE'LL HAVE TO FIND THE BOND A SINGLE PAYER PROGRAM IN THE FUTURE AND FRANKLY COMPASSION DICTATES THAT AS LONG AS THE SYSTEM WE ARE WORKING WITH IS EXCLUDING ANYONE WE SHOULD WORK TO BRING THEM INTO THE SYSTEM HOWEVER DO NOT MISTAKE COMPASSION FOR ACCEPTANCE OF A STATUS QUO THAT ULTIMATELY IT'S BUSINESS FISCALLY UNSUSTAINABLE UNREASONABLY INEFFICIENT AND MORALLY INDEFENSIBLE WITH CALCULATOR WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE CALIFORNIA TO A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM TO PAY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES THE SYSTEM THAT COUNTLESS REPUTABLE ACADEMIC STUDIES HAVE CONCLUDED TIME AND AGAIN WILL SAVE OUR STATE TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR AND HEALTH CARE COSTS AND WHAT IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FOR TODAY'S HEARING THAT'S HOW WE CAN SET UP A SYSTEM OF RESPONSIBLE GOVERNANCE A CLEAR DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPREHENSIVE CARE CALIFORNIANS SHOULD EXPECT IN A SINGLE PAYER HEALTHCARE SYSTEM ALONG WITH THE STRUCTURE FOR PAYMENT OF SERVICE PROVIDERS WITH PROVISIONS FOR COST CONTAINMENT OF COURSE YOU SHOULD BE AWARE AS DESCRIBED IN THE STOP ANALYSIS ABOUT THE INTRODUCTION OF A CA ELEVEN WHICH IS INTENDED TO RAISE THE NECESSARY STATE REVENUES TO CLOSE THE FUNDING GAP AND ADDRESS CONSTITUTIONAL ELEMENTS FOR RAISING THESE REVENUES FOR A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM THE REASONING OF INTRODUCING A SEPARATE BILL IS THREE FOLD ONE AS WAS DETAILED TO ME DIRECTLY WHEN I WENT TO WASHINGTON DC IN OCTOBER AND MET WITH THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR POLICY OVERSEEING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAIVER PROCESS FOR THE APARTMENT HEALTH HUMAN SERVICES HE AND HIS TEAM MADE IT CLEAR THAT LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY WAS REQUIRED PRIOR TO THE STATE APPLYING FOR A FEDERAL THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO WAIVERS ESSENTIALLY A POLICY BILL MUST BE PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR WHAT STATE FUNDING WILL NEED TO BE KNOWN BEFORE HHS APPROVES THE WAIVER FUNDING DOES NOT NEED TO BE FINAL FOR APPLICATION OR INCLUDED IN THE POLICY BILL THIS MAKES SENSE SINCE THE FEDERAL WAIVER PROCESS WILL HELP DETERMINE HOW MUCH A STATE WILL NEED TO RAISE AND FUNDS TO FULLY FUND THE PROGRAM SECONDLY THIS ALLOWS A FULL VETTING FOR THE FINANCING MECHANISM WITHOUT THE CONSTRAINTS OF A TO YOUR BILL TIMELINE OVER THE YEARS THE UNRELENTING QUESTION WHENEVER A SINGLE PAYER HEALTHCARE BILLS INTRODUCED IS HOW WE GONNA PAY FOR IT AS ELEVEN MAKES AN ATTEMPT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION UNLIKE ANY OTHER EFFORT IN THE PAST OF COURSE THAT IS WHAT HAS BEEN PUT FORTH IS AND SHOULD BE OPEN TO DEBATE DISCUSSION AND STAKEHOLDER INPUT AND NOW WE HAVE TIME TO ALLOW FOR THAT FINALLY BEING IN A CA THE FUNDING MECHANISM ALSO WE GO BEFORE THE VOTERS ONCE A POLICY BILL HAS HOPEFULLY BEEN PASSING A WAIVER PROCESS IS BEING NEGOTIATED WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CALIFORNIA VOTERS WILL KNOW WHAT IT IS THEY CAN EXPECT A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM AND WHAT WILL COST A CHANGE FOR THIS IMPORTANT THE MAGNITUDE SHOULD ULTIMATELY BE DETERMINED BY THE WILL OF THE VOTERS AND THEY DESERVE TO HAVE THE FULL PICTURE OF THE SYSTEM AND POLICY THERE'D BE PAYING INTO NOW TO FOURTEEN HUNDRED WHAT WHICH IS WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY YOU'RE LIKELY TO HEAR A FEW COMMON THEMES IN THE OPPOSITION FIRST THEY WILL FOCUS ON THE COST OF THE SYSTEM BECAUSE OF TAXES THE USUAL PUSH BACK WE'VE COME TO EXPECT THAT'S RECOGNIZE ONE THING THE DATA SHOWS VERY CLEARLY WE ARE ALREADY PAYING THE HIGHEST HEALTH TAX IN THE WORLD YOU MAY REFER TO IT AS PREMIUMS DEDUCTIBLES CO PAYS THE NILE CARE AND THIS CORPORATE BUREAUCRACY BUT IT'S AS CLEAR AS DAY WE'RE BEING FLEECED AND FAR TOO MANY UNDERSTANDABLY FEEL HELPLESS ABOUT WE KNOW CHARACTER WILL BE CONSIDERED OF IT WILL BE CONSIDERABLY LESS EXPENSIVE THAN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM WE CAN DRIVE DOWN COSTS FAR BELOW OUR CURRENT SYSTEM WHILE EXPANDING CARE SECOND YOU MAY HEAR THE GOVERNMENT IS BAD THEY CAN'T RUN OUR HEALTH CARE AS OFFICIALLY AS PRIVATE INDUSTRY ALL THIS IS ALSO WHERE WE NEED TO BE VERY CLEAR THIS IS NOT A GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER OF HEALTHCARE YOU STILL HAVE THE SAME ACCESS TO THE SAME DOCTORS AND NURSES AND CLINICS YOU ACCESS TO NOW THE ONLY DIFFERENCE OF THE TAB WILL BE PICKED UP BY THE STATE HEALTHCARE MY FATHER HAS GONE TO THE SAME DOCTOR AND UNFORTUNATELY ON OCCASION HOSPITAL FOR DECADES HE'S ON MEDICARE FOR OVER A DOZEN YEARS HE HASN'T CHANGED WHERE HE GOES FOR CARE ONE BIT THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT IS LESS BUREAUCRATIC NOW THAT HE SIMPLY SHOWS HIS MEDICARE CARD FOR CARE AND LET'S NOT BE UNDER THE ILLUSION THAT DEALING WITH PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES AS A JOY IT IS PAINFUL ESPECIALLY WHEN SOME UNKNOWN CORPORATE BUREAUCRAT IGNORES THE SCIENTIFIC EDUCATED DIAGNOSIS OF A NURSE OR DOCTOR AND OVERRULES THE TREATMENT PRESCRIBED AND THEN THE DOCTOR OR INSURANCE COMPANY TELLS YOU TO START A GO FUND ME ACCOUNT IN THE WEALTHIEST STATE IN THE WEALTHIEST NATION ON EARTH THIS SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING YOU MAY HEAR THE LOSER CHOICE WHAT'S YOUR CHOICE NOW DO YOU HAVE YOU HAVE FREE REIGN TO CHOOSE YOUR DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS -- ARE YOU NEARLY LIMITED BASED UPON THE PLAN OR GROUP YOU'RE PART OF WE WANT TO GET RID OF THE OUT OF NETWORK MADNESS GO TO THE DOCTOR HOSPITAL CLINIC MOST CONVENIENT TO YOU THAT WE WANT TO INCREASE CHOICE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO RURAL COMMUNITIES AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE ARE LIMITED OPTIONS YOU'LL HEAR BUT NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF CODE IS NOT THE TIME ACCORDING TO OPPOSITION IS NEVER THE TIME HOWEVER I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE COVER CRISIS IS PERFECTLY EXEMPLIFIED WHY OUR EMPLOYER BASED MULTI PAYER USUALLY PROFITABLE FOR THE VERY FEW SYSTEM IS AN OUT LIAR IN THE WORLD A QUARTER OF CALIFORNIA FAMILIES HAVE CUT BACK ON FOOD CLOTHING OR IN COURT CREDIT CARD DEBT OR OTHER FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS BECAUSE THEY WERE UNABLE TO PAY MEDICAL BILLS OUR RESIDENTS ARE DELAYING MEDICAL TREATMENT CUTTING PILLS IN HALF TO MAKE THEIR MEDICATION LAST LONGER WE ALREADY HAVE HEALTH CARE RATIONING WITH THE STATUS QUO AND THAT'S WHY EIGHTY FOUR PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS RATE MAKING HEALTH CARE MORE AFFORDABLE AS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT OR VERY IMPORTANT PRIORITY FOR THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE AND WE LOOK AT OUR MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIA'S THE SITUATION IS EVEN MORE DIRE BUT THEIR HEALTHCARE WE DON'T THAT HEALTH CARE JUSTICE IS AN ECONOMIC JUSTICE ISSUE WE KNOW HEALTHCARE JUSTICE AS A RACIAL JUSTICE ISSUE WE KNOW HEALTHCARE JUSTICE IS AN IMMIGRANT JUSTICE ISSUE THE ISSUE OF HEALTH CARE JUST AS BEING A SOCIAL TRUST JUSTICE ISSUE WAS FIRST IDENTIFIED DECADES AGO BY DR KING UNFORTUNATELY DISPARITIES GOTTEN WORSE SO I ASK YOU TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND MIND OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE NOT WHAT WE ARE COMFORTABLE WITH OR WHAT WE KNOW BECAUSE THERE'S A WHOLE WORLD OUT THERE THAT KNOWS A DIFFERENT REALITY AND YET I DON'T WANT TO FALL THE MODEL A SINGLE PAYER THAT IS DONE BY OTHER COUNTRIES I WANT US TO DO BETTER THAN ANY OTHER PLACE IN THE WORLD WE'RE CALIFORNIA AND WE SHOULD EXPECT NOTHING LESS OF OURSELVES ALL RIGHT TO HAND IT OVER TO JOIN AUTHOR AS A MEMBER SANTIAGO FOR A FEW COMMENTS THANK YOU AND I'M I THINK THE CHAIR FOR ALLOWING ME TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS EVEN THOUGH WE'RE UNDER THE CONSTRAINT TO COPE IF I VERY MUCH APPRECIATED L. COMING TO TAKE A DIFFERENT ROUTE TO UP NOT JUST ASK FOR A VOTE HERE AND EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT BUT BUT ALSO TO THANK THE COMMITTEE PARTICULARLY UNDER MISTER WOULD LEADERSHIP FOR THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT RECOGNIZE THAT WE'VE TAKEN SOME STEPS FORWARD AND INTO IMPROVING -- HEALTH CARE ACCESS IT SOME OF THOSE MAJOR STEPS DID INCLUDES SOME OF YOUR WORK -- IT IN TURN TURN TO PAY TO DELAY SO THAT PHARMACEUTICAL OF PRESCRIPTIONS WOULD BE MUCH MUCH LESS COSTLY PEOPLE THAT'S AND THAT'S A BIG STEP THAT WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE WE WE RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT IN THIS COMMITTEE WE FOUGHT RESIDENTS -- IMPACTS ONE OF THE FIRST PIECE OF THE WORK THAT I DID WOULDN'T MIND NOT WHEN WE GOT HERE WILL WAS UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS COMMITTEE ON THE PARTICULAR MISTER WOULD TO INCREASE AT THE AGE OF OF THOSE WHO COULD VIE BY -- TOBACCO T. O. ABOUT THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE WHICH HAD TREMENDOUS -- IMPACTS ON THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITY AND IF THE RECALL SURPRISE BUILDINGS AND I CAN GO ON BECAUSE WHEN I SAT HERE BEFORE THINKING ABOUT WHAT I WOULD SAY -- AND MADE ABOUT A TWO DOZEN LIST OF THINGS THAT THIS COMMITTEE IS DONE AND THIS IS HOUSES DONE TO IMPROVE AND INCREASE ACCESS -- THAT LIST WOULDN'T BE COMPLETE IF I DIDN'T MENTION -- GIVING UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS -- HEALTHCARE COVERAGE WHICH BEGAN AND -- WHEN WE DID A TWENTY SIX AND BELOW AND HAS NOW INCREASED TO FIFTY AND YESTERDAY WE SAW A REMARKABLE OF A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AS IT RELATES TO ALL GETTING HEALTHCARE COVERAGE THIS IS ALL TO SAY THAT WE HAVE ALREADY MOVED IN A DIRECTION OF LOOKING ABOUT HOW TO GET HEALTH CARE COVERAGE A TO ALL THIS IS SO IT'S ALL PART OF A LARGER CONVERSATION NOW THAT WERE ENGAGED AS A HEALTHY CONVERSATION AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE QUESTIONS AND YOU SHOULD HAVE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT CREATES GOOD PUBLIC POLICY SO FOR THE QUESTIONS THAT I THINK WILL HELP TO INFORM IF WE ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO MOVE FORWARD IT HELPS US TO ALLOW TO CREATE PUBLIC POLICY THAT IS ACTUALLY SOUND -- AND AND THAT IS STRENGTHENED BY THE CONVERSATIONS THIS COMMITTEE SO OVER TAKE A LOOK AT THE A.

FOURTEEN HUNDRED UNDER KELP HERE SENIORS AND DISABLED PEOPLE WOULD HAVE THE FREEDOM TO LIVE SAFELY AT HOME WITH THE SAME CARE THAT ALLOWS ME TO BE HERE WITH YOU ALL TODAY ALL CALIFORNIANS WOULD RECEIVE THE CARE THEY NEED REGARDLESS OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT IMMIGRATION OR MARITAL STATUS AND WE WOULD PROMOTE HEALTH EQUITY BY INVESTING IN CARE FACILITIES IN OUR MOST UNDERSERVED AND RURAL COMMUNITIES AT OUR BEST CALIFORNIA CAN LEAD THE NATION TO AVOID JUST FUTURE LIKE WE HAVE DONE ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND MARRIAGE EQUALITY WE SHOULD DO THE SAME ON HEALTHCARE YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU A HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY AND I URGE YOU TO SEIZE A S.

FOURTEEN HUNDRED HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT AND CALIFORNIA HAS THE DUTY AN OPPORTUNITY TO FINALLY ENSURE THAT ALL OF US HAVE BEEN HERE WE NEED TO DRIVE THANK YOU THANK YOU MR BARKAN -- WILL NOW MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT WITNESS -- CARMEN CONSTI THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M COMING CONSTI LEAGUE REGULATORY POLICY SPECIALIST ON BEHALF OF THE MIGHTY CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION WHICH REPRESENTS OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND REGISTERED NURSES ACROSS THE STATE CNA IS A PROUD SPONSOR OF EIGHTY FOURTEEN HUNDRED WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH THE CALIFORNIA GUARANTEED HEALTHCARE FOR ALL PROGRAM ACCOUNT HERE A SINGLE PUBLIC PROGRAMS THAT WOULD GUARANTEE AND PAY FOR HIGH QUALITY COMPREHENSIVE CARE FOR EVERY CALIFORNIA RESIDENT IN OTHER WORDS A SINGLE PAYER FOR HEALTH CARE IN OUR STATE EVERY DAY NURSES WITNESS PREVENTABLE HEALTHCARE TRAGEDIES THAT RESULT FROM OUR CURRENT FRAGMENTED TO SOME OF INSURANCE AGENTS FOR GO THE MEDICATIONS AND CARE THEY NEED SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD IT MEANWHILE INSURERS AND HEALTH PLAN MIDDLEMAN DENYING AND LIMIT CARE AVOIDING COVERAGE OF THE SICKEST RESEARCHING PROVIDER NETWORKS CREATING FINANCIAL BARRIERS ALL TO MAINTAIN CORPORATE BOTTOM LINE AB FOURTEEN HUNDRED WOULD ESTABLISH THE POLICY FRAMEWORK THAT WOULD TRANSFORM OUR PROFIT DRIVEN HEALTH INSURANCE SYSTEM INTO A SYSTEM THAT PRIORITIZES PATIENT CARE I'LL PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF KEY ELEMENTS OF THE BILL AND THE HEALTHCARE PROGRAM AND I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS LATER THE BILL ESTABLISHES AND GUARANTEES UNDER CAL CARE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS AT THE RATE EVERY CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY WITHOUT BEING TIED TO A JOB OR IMMIGRATION STATUS AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER AN INSURANCE COMPANY DEEMS THEM TO BE A LIABILITY TO CORPORATE POCKETBOOKS ALL HEALTHCARE PAYMENTS WILL BE PAID THROUGH THE COW CARE PROGRAM REPLACING MULTIPLE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC PAYERS MEDICARE MEDICARE AND COVER CALIFORNIA WOULD BE INCORPORATED INTO HEALTHCARE IN A MANNER THAT IS SEAMLESS TO THE PROGRAM BENEFICIARIES AND THAT'S PERMITTED UNDER FEDERAL APPROVALS ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA NOTED FEDERAL WAIVERS CAN ONLY BE OBTAINED AFTER THE POLICY BILL OF CALCAREOUS PASSED HEALTHCARE IS GOVERNED BY A NINE MEMBER BOARD OF HEALTH CARE EXPERTS WITH APPOINTMENTS SPLIT BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WOULD SERVE AS A NON VOTING EX OFFICIO MEMBER THE BOARD IS CHARGED WITH MANAGING THE TRANSITION IMPLEMENTATION M. AND ENROLLMENT PROCESSES FOR CAL CARE AND THE BOARD IS GIVEN AUTHORITY TO APPLY FOR ANY NECESSARY FEDERAL APPROVALS THE RESULT TO BE A PUBLIC ADVISORY COMMITTEE WITH A ROTATING SEAT ON THE BOARD AND THEN ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORT THE BILL ALSO ESTABLISHES A DESIGNATED CAL CARE TRUST FUND AND AS OUTLINED IN CHAPTER NINE THE COW CARE PROGRAM DOES NOT BECOME FULLY OPERATIVE UNTIL THE TRUST FUND HAD SUFFICIENT REVENUE TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM THE COW CARE BENEFITS PACKAGE DETAILED IN CHAPTER FOUR IS TRULY COMPREHENSIVE AND WOULD BE BETTER THAN ANY EXISTING PRIVATE OR PUBLIC HEALTH PLAN HEALTHCARE WOULD PAY FOR ALL NECESSARY AND APPROPRIATE CARE FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS INCLUDING MEDICAL DENTAL VISION HEARING SERVICES AS WELL AS PRIMARY AND PREVENTIVE CARE REPRODUCTIVE CARE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND MORE BENEFITS ALSO INCLUDE COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE OF LONG TERM SERVICE INSISTS AND TO IT FOR PEOPLE LIVE LIVING WITH DISABILITIES AND OLDER ADULTS AND WHEN IT COMES TO RECEIVING CARE EIGHTY FOURTEEN HUNDRED ENSURES THAT EVERYONE GETS THE CARE THEY NEED BY ELIMINATING FINANCIAL AND INSURANCE CARRIERS WITH NO COST SHARING UNDER THE PROGRAMME CARE WOULD BE FREE AT THE POINT OF SERVICE NO COPAYS NO DEDUCTIBLES AND NO PREMIUMS A. B. FOURTEEN HUNDRED WOULD ELIMINATE NARROW PROVIDER NETWORKS AND THERE WOULD BE NO PRIOR AUTHORIZATION OR REFERRALS REQUIRED SO I'M LIKE OUR CURRENT SYSTEM WHERE INSURERS LIMIT WHICH DOCTORS WE CAN SEE AND ONE HUNDRED HEALTHCARE WITH ONE NETWORK OF PROVIDERS SPENDING THE STATE EVERYONE WOULD HAVE TRUE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE OUR DOCTORS AND PROVIDERS IMPORTANTLY PROFIT MOTIVES AND FINANCIAL INCENTIVES WOULD NO LONGER DETERMINE CARE RATHER DECISION ON DECISIONS ON CARE ARE UNDER CAL CARE WOULD BE BASED ON PATIENT NEED THE NECESSARY AT AND APPROPRIATE CARE FOR EACH PATIENT IS DETERMINED BY THE PATIENTS TREATING HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL AND WOULD BE COVERED UNDER THE PROGRAM THIS MEANS THAT CAL CARE PUTS DECISIONS OF CARE INTO THE HANDS OF PATIENTS AND THEIR DOCTORS NURSES AND OTHER HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AS OPPOSED TO INSURANCE COMPANIES AND CORPORATE BOARD ROOMS CHAPTER FIVE OF THE BILL ESTABLISHES PROVIDER PARTICIPATION AND PAYMENT STRUCTURES FOR HOSPITALS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL PROVIDERS THEY WOULD BE PAID THROUGH INSTITUTIONAL GLOBAL BUDGETING PROCESS THESE WERE OPERATING BUDGETS ARE NEGOTIATED ANNUALLY BETWEEN CAL CARE AND EACH INSTITUTIONAL PROVIDER THESE BUDGETS WOULD BE PAID AND REVIEWED QUARTERLY ALIGNING HOSPITAL PAYMENTS WITH COST THESE GLOBAL BUDGETS ARE TAILORED TO MEET AND RESPECT THE CARE AND ACCESS NEEDS OF THE PATIENT SURVEY EACH HOSPITAL FOR DOCTOR GROUPS AND INDIVIDUAL PROVIDERS THEY CAN CHOOSE BETWEEN -- TO BE PAID THROUGH SALARY PAYMENTS OR A FEE SCHEDULE THAT WOULD BE SET BY NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN PROVIDERS AND HEALTHCARE EACH YEAR NOW I ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT EIGHTY FOURTEEN HUNDRED WHAT CONTROL COSTS WITHOUT HAVING TO RESORT TO CARE RATIONING AND -- DENIAL STUDY AFTER STUDY HAS SHOWN THAT A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM LIKE HEALTHCARE IS THE ONLY SOLUTION THAT WOULD PROVIDE UNIVERSAL COMPREHENSIVE BENEFITS TO ALL WHILE ALSO REDUCING OVERALL HEALTH CARE SPENDING WE WOULD GET MORE COVER EVERYONE AND PAY LESS AB FOURTEEN HUNDRED WITH TASTE CALIFORNIA TIME THE BILLIONS EACH YEAR BY ELIMINATING ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLEXITY OF OUR CURRENT SYSTEM AND BY LEVERAGING OUR COLLECTIVE BUYING POWER UNDER THE SINGLE PAYER OF HEALTHCARE TO NEGOTIATE FAIR PRICES FOR EVERYONE YOU'RE BOTH BALK NEGOTIATIONS HEALTHCARE WOULD AND HIGH PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES AND INSTEAD OF PAYMENTS GOING TOWARD INFLATED PRICES ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLEXITY AND HEALTH INDUSTRY PROFITEERING OR HEALTHCARE DOLLARS WILL GO TOWARDS CARE CRITICALLY WITH A SIMPLIFIED AND UNIFIED CLAIMS PROCESS HEALTHCARE WOULD NOT ONLY SAVE MONEY BUT IT WOULD IMPROVE THE LIVES IN PRACTICE OVER HEALTH CARE PERFECT PROFESSIONALS OUR DOCTORS AND OUR NURSES PROVIDERS AS WELL AS PATIENTS WOULD SPEND LESS TIME MONEY AND RESOURCES NAVIGATING A WEB OF INSURANCE SYSTEMS AND DOCTORS AND NURSES WOULD HAVE MORE TIME TO DO WHAT THEY DO BEST CARE FOR PATIENTS THEY COULD PROVIDE CARE BASED ON THEIR BEST PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT WITHOUT INSURANCE CORPORATION INTERFERENCE RESULTING IN BETTER CARE ADDITIONALLY UNDER A SINGLE STATEWIDE SYSTEM ACCOUNTABILITY BECOMES EASIER THE BILL FOLD EXISTING MEDIC HOW CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND THE COW CARE AND IT IT ESTABLISHES ADDITIONAL PROGRAM STANDARDS AND PROTECTIONS AGAINST FRAUD AND ABUSE FOR EXAMPLE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS ARE PROHIBITED FROM MAKING GET ENGAGING IN A CODING PRACTICES AND ARE PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN FINANCIAL INCENTIVE SCHEMES THAT INTERFERE WITH PATIENT CARE THE BOARD WILL ALSO DEVELOP INTO INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW PROCESS HE'S IN CONSULTATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE AND NOTABLY THE BILL PROHIBITS PROVIDERS AT -- AND THE COW CARE SYSTEM FROM THE DYING CARE REDUCING BENEFITS OR OTHERWISE DISCRIMINATING AGAINST CALIFORNIANS BASED ON THEIR INCLUSION IN A PROTECTED CATEGORY AND ONE LAST IMPORTANT PIECE OF THE BILL IS THAT CAL CARE CREATES THE FRAMEWORK TO TARGET AND DISMANTLE HEALTH INEQUITIES THAT OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IS BUILT UPON THE BOARD IS CHARGED WITH ENSURING THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS RECEIVE CULTURALLY LINGUISTICALLY AND STRUCTURALLY COMPETENT CARE AND TO BRING US CLOSER TO ACHIEVING HEALTH EQUITY HEALTHCARE WITH AND EXISTENCE OF CARE BY PLACING EVERYONE UNDER THE SINGLE ROOF OF CALCAREOUS WITH THAT WITH A SINGLE STANDARD OF CARE FOR ALL AND TO ADDRESS DISTRIBUTIONAL DISPARITIES IN OUR HEALTHCARE INFRASTRUCTURE EIGHTY FOURTEEN HUNDRED CREATE A SPECIAL PROJECTS BUDGET TO HELP BUILD RENOVATE AND STASHED FACILITIES AND RURAL UNDERSERVED AND HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREAS CAL CARE WILL ALSO ADDRESS PROVIDER RATE AND PRIORITIZE PROJECTS TO IMPROVE HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND QUALITY AND TO ADDRESS HEALTH INEQUITIES FOR BLACK INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AS WELL AS INEQUITIES BASED ON GEOGRAPHY DISABILITY SOCIO ECONOMIC STATUS AND FOR NON ENGLISH SPEAKING COMMUNITIES GENDER NON CONFORMING COMMITTEE AND OTHER ARE UNDERSERVED GROUPS TOGETHER THESE PROVISIONS UNDER CAL CARE WOULD ENSURE THAT ALL HOSPITALS AND CLINICS NO MATTER WHO THEY SERVE HAVE THE RESOURCES THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO STAY OPEN AND THIS MEANS WE CAN FINALLY ADDRESSED THE ONGOING CRISIS OF HOSPITAL CLOSURES AND HEALTH CARE DESERT THAT HAVE EXACERBATED HEALTH DISPARITIES IN CLOSING PIECEMEAL EFFORTS TO FIX OUR MULTI PAIR QUAGMIRE OF INSURANCE HAVE NOT AND WILL NOT AND OUR HEALTHCARE CRISIS WE CANNOT EXPECT A SYSTEM THAT IS DESIGNED TO SQUEEZE EVERY DOLLAR AND CENT FOR MORE HELP FROM THE PAIN MISERY AND ELEMENTS OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS TO PUT PATIENTS OVER PROFITS UNDER CAL CARE THERE WOULD BE NO MORE DETAILS OF CARE NO MORE PRICE GOUGING AND NO MORE EXTRACTING CORPORATE WEALTH FROM OUR HOUSE THIS COMMITTEE MUST ACT URGENTLY TO PASS EIGHTY FOR WORKING HUNDRED ANY DELAY WILL BE PAID TO THE HEALTH AND LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY

HERE TODAY COBIT IS TAKING A HUGE TOLL ON OUR PROVIDERS THE NEW MAYO CLINIC SURVEY JUST RELEASED TODAY A TWENTY TWO THOUSAND HEALTH PROFESSIONALS INDICATES THAT THIRTY PERCENT OF U. S. DOCTORS AND NURSES INTEND TO REDUCE THEIR HOURS OVER THE COMING YEAR WITH THIS IN MIND WE SHOULD BE MINDFUL OF THE IMPACTS THAT ARE HEALTH POLICY PROPOSALS HAVE ON THE PEOPLE WHO CARE FOR US AND OUR LOVED ONES ON A DAILY BASIS I'D LIKE TO START BY RECOGNIZING THE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS MADE BY THE GOLDEN STATE IMPLEMENTING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SOMETIMES IN THE FACE OF STUBBORN OPPOSITION FROM OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN CONGRESS I WAS GREATLY PLEASED TO HEAR OUR GOVERNOR STATE YESTERDAY WE WILL NOW CLOSE THE REMAINING FINAL COVERAGE GAP BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR HGV UNIVERSAL COVERAGE SYSTEM UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN OUR STATE WE HAVE MUCH TO BE THANKFUL FOR IN TERMS OF OUR PROGRESS HERE IN CALIFORNIA I CAN SUMMARIZE MY MEMBERS CONCERNS OVER THIS MEASURES FOLLOWS MY MEMBERS ARE NOT A PART OF THE SOLUTION PROPOSED UNDER A. B. FOURTEEN HUNDRED HE ORGANIZED INTEGRATED POSITION GROUPS OF THE CALIFORNIA DELEGATED MODEL WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM PARTICIPATING IN A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM AND WOULD THUS BE PUT OUT OF OPERATION THIS IS A TREMENDOUS STEP BACKWARDS FOR CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE DELIVERY AND FRANKLY I DON'T SEE THE POINT IT WAS A CALIFORNIA DELEGATED MODEL THAT PIONEERED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SAME DAY APPOINTMENT ACCESS OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO OUR MEMBERS WERE THE FIRST TO ADOPT ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS ON A MASS SCALE AN ELECTRONIC PATIENT PORTALS TO MAKE LIFE EASIER FOR PATIENTS TO NAVIGATE IN THE SYSTEM IN ORDER MEMBERS PLAYING YOUR POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT BEFORE IT WAS EVEN A COMMONLY USED TERM IN HEALTHCARE POLICY CIRCLES OVER THIRTY YEARS AGO BUT THIS BILL DOES AWAY WITH ALL OF THE UNDERLYING FOUNDATION THAT PRODUCE THIS UNIQUE MODEL OF CARE THAT OTHER STATES AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOW SEEK TO EMULATE AND PROPAGATE AB FOURTEEN HUNDRED OFFERS TWO CHOICES TO POSITIONS IN OTHER CLINICAL PROVIDERS ACCEPTING MEDICARE FEE SCHEDULE FOR SERVICE RATES OR BECOMING EMPLOYED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA UNDER SALARY SYSTEM NEITHER OF THESE CHOICES IS BEING PROPOSED -- ADVOCATED ANYWHERE ELSE OR BY THE MEDICARE SYSTEM HAS PREFERRED OPTIONS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM STILL REDEPLOYMENT OF POSITIONS HAS BEEN SHOWN TIME AND TIME AGAIN TO REDUCE PHYSICIAN PRODUCTIVITY OVER TIME PROPONENTS CITE THAT THEY WOULD SEEK WAIVERS FROM THE CMS CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID INNOVATION FOR THEIR DELIVERY SYSTEM REFORMS BUT MY ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN INTIMATELY INVOLVED WITH CMMI POLICY FOR TWO DECADES IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CMMI HAS BEEN AND REMAINS TO SHIP PROVIDERS AWAY FROM PEOPLE SERVICE PAYMENT MODELS TOWARD FINANCIAL RISK SHARING IN ORDER TO IMPROVE PATIENT OUTCOMES IT IS DIRECTIONALLY OFF THE SET OF THE PROPOSAL IN THIS BILL ABANDONING THE ADVANCED POSITION PAYMENT MODELS OF THE CALIFORNIA DELEGATED MODEL WILL BE A STEP BACKWARD TOWARD A MORE FRAGMENTED CARE DELIVERY ENVIRONMENT IN CALIFORNIA HE WILL ALSO RAISE OVERALL HEALTH CARE COSTS FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE SEEN IN THE ACTIONS OF THE PRECEDING CONGRESS AND EFFORTS TO DISMANTLE THE ACA WHICH THANKFULLY DID NOT HAPPEN ANY FUTURE CONGRESS WOULD NOT BE BOUND BY THE PAST AGREEMENTS THANK COULD VERY WELL BE CALIFORNIA READ -- WHICH REDUCED FUNDING TO OPERATE SUCH A SYSTEM ESPECIALLY IN THE COMPLEX PLANS OUTLINED IN THIS BILL DO NOT NEED A SMOOTH TRANSITION S. AND FORTUNATELY VERY LIKELY THANK YOU I THINK IT WAS BARCELONA WILL MOVE ON TO MISTER YOUNG THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS PRESTON YOUNG FROM THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HERE TODAY IN OPPOSITION TO AB FOURTEEN HUNDRED FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO MAKE IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR WE ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT EVERY CALIFORNIAN IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AND NOT JUST ANY HEALTH CARE COVERAGE IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY IMPERATIVE THAT THEY RECEIVE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE HOWEVER AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AND SINGLE PAYER GOVERNMENT RUN HEALTH CARE COVERAGE ARE TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TOPICS IF WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SINGLE PAYER HEALTH CARE THAT IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THE PAYER EVERYONE CAN AGREE THAT THE PROPOSALS CONTAINED WITHIN AB FOURTEEN HUNDRED WELL TAX CALIFORNIANS HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS THIS IS COMPLETELY ANTITHETICAL TO AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE THIS UNSUSTAINABLE TAX BURDEN FALL DIRECTLY ON THE SHOULDERS OF CALIFORNIA'S EMPLOYERS WHICH IS WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY OPPOSITION SO FIRST LET'S TALK ABOUT COSTS IT'S INDISPUTABLE AB FOURTEEN HUNDRED WOULD INCREASE TAXES FOR CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES BY HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT CALIFORNIA'S TOTAL HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES WERE AN ESTIMATED THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TO PUT THIS INTO PERSPECTIVE THAT'S THIRTEEN POINT TWO PERCENT OF THE STATE'S GDP THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ALSO POINTS OUT THE CALIFORNIA'S PER CAPITA HEALTHCARE SPENDING IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WITH TEN THOUSAND EIGHTY SIX DOLLARS EVEN ASSUMING FEDERAL FUNDING STAYS IN PLACE AB FOURTEEN HUNDRED WOULD REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT TAX CONTRIBUTION EACH CALIFORNIANS EVEN PARTIALLY APPROACH THESE FIGURES IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT PROPONENTS OF A PUBLICLY QUOTED AS SAYING ECA ELEVEN WOULD RAISE A HUNDRED SIXTY TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY AS A COMMITTEE ANALYSIS APPLICANTS OUT THIS WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY UNDER FUND A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM WHICH MEANS ALL OF US WOULD ACTUALLY PAY MORE TAXES AND CURRENTLY PROPOSED PREMIUMS DEDUCTIBLES AND TWENTY CARE COST WE'VE DONE AWAY WITH UNDER AB FOURTEEN HUNDRED THE SIMPLY BE REPLACED A TAX OBLIGATIONS UNDER ACA ELEVEN NOW LET'S PUT THIS INTO PERSPECTIVE AND GIVE IT A LITTLE CONTEXT CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS THE HIGHEST GAS TAX RATE IN THE NATION CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST SALES TAX RATE IN THE NATION CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST PERSONAL INCOME TAX RATE IN THE NATION CALIFORNIA HAS THE EIGHTH HIGHEST CORPORATE TAX RATE UNITED STATES THE HIGHEST IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES NOW AB FOURTEEN HUNDRED AND EASY ELEVEN PROPOSED EARLIER THE BIGGEST TAX INCREASE IN STATE HISTORY NOT ONCE BUT ANNUALLY YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR ON THE STRUGGLING CALIFORNIANS ATTEMPTING TO GET THROUGH PANDEMIC SO THE STATE CAN TAKE OVER ONE OF THE MOST COMPLEX SYSTEMS THAT EXISTS IN THE MIDST OF AN UNRELENTING COBA NINETEEN PANDEMIC ALSO THE PAYROLL TAXES MENTION AN AC ELEVEN WILL COMBINE OF THE PAYROLL TAX INCREASES COMING NEXT YEAR DO ARE YOU AYE FUND INSOLVENCY FURTHERMORE THE TAX INCREASES WOULD BE STATIC UNDER AC ELEVEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO INTEGRATE WITH HEALTH CARE COSTS YEAR AFTER YEAR MANY THE ENORMOUS TAX INCREASES WOULD HAVE AN UNREMITTED PACE OF GROWTH NEXT WE OPPOSE AB FOURTEEN HUNDRED BECAUSE IT WILL DRIVE EMPLOYMENT ELSEWHERE AB FOURTEEN HUNDRED WILL RADICALLY FREEDOM OF CHOICE FOR CONSUMERS WILL HEAVILY TAXING EMPLOYERS TO EXPAND THE CALIFORNIA SINCE THIS WILL BE A STATE SYSTEM AND NOT NATIONALIZED HEALTHCARE EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES WOULD BE FREE TO LEAVE THE STATE AND THEY COULD LEAVE THE STATE SO THAT THEY COULD USE THEIR OWN PRIVATE HEALTH CARE RATHER THAN BEING FORCED TO PARTICIPATE IN STATE BUREAUCRACY BELIEVED TO AVOID THE HIGHEST TAXES IN THE COUNTRY EMPLOYERS BELIEVED TO AVOID ENORMOUS GROSS RECEIPTS TAXES PAYROLL TAXES WILL BEING ABLE TO EXPAND ELSEWHERE THIS EXIST WILL PUNISH THE REMAINING CALIFORNIANS WITH HIGHER TAXES IN ORDER TO OFFSET OFFSET THE FUNDING SHORTFALL LAST AS MENTIONED EARLIER CALIFORNIA'S APPROACHING NEAR UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE RENDERING EIGHTY FOURTEEN HUNDRED UNNECESSARY AS ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S BUDGET BRINGS CALIFORNIA ONE STEP CLOSER TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE NO MAKE CALIFORNIA THE FIRST STATE TO OFFER HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR ALL INCOME ELIGIBLE RESIDENTS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS IN CLOSING WELL OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM CAN IMPROVE IN MANY WAYS COMPLETELY ABOLISHING THE CURRENT SYSTEM IN THE FACE OF AN UNRELENTING PANDEMIC BI ANNUALLY TAX IN CALIFORNIA HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IS NOT THE SOLUTION PATIENTS NEED RELIABLE ACCESS TO CARE RIGHT NOW IT IS NOT A TIME TO EXPERIMENT

N. A ROUGH IDEA OF SOME SORT OF AN ESTIMATE OF HOW LONG YOU THINK THIS POLICY WOULD TAKE TO IMPLEMENT THE REASON I ASK THAT IS THAT I CONSTANTLY HEAR SINGLE PAYER NOW MMHM AND AND -- WE JUST HAD THIS NOW I I JUST WANNA HEAR YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THAT BECAUSE I THINK YOU KNOW THAT EVEN THE SIMPLEST OF POLICIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAN SOMETIMES TAKE YEARS TO GET THE PART GET GET THE REGULATIONS WRITTEN THANK YOU SO MUCH OF THE NOVEL OF ALSO TRYING TO BE VERY CLEAR -- OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS -- WHEN I'VE SPOKEN PUBLICLY AND SPOKEN TO COLLEAGUES ABOUT THE PROCESS PROCESS ITSELF ALLOWS A FIVE YEAR RUNWAY A KIND OF FOR THE TECH TO GET A PROGRAM SET UP AND SO AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS A POLICY BILL AS I INDICATED THE GETTING IS YOUR STOP AND ALSO PROBABLY MENTION MR CHER -- THERE'S ALSO A SEPARATE FUNDING MECHANISM BILL A LOT OF DIFFERENT STEPS WOULD HAVE TO OCCUR IN ORDER FOR -- TO GET TO THE POINT OF OF OF OF A FULL SINGLE PAYER PROGRAM SO THIS IS A FIRST STEP -- AND IF ALL THINGS GO WELL AND IS ABLE TO GET TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR AND ALLOWING THEM THE ADMINISTRATION TO APPLY FOR FEDERAL WAIVERS I DO WITH THEN SIMULTANEOUSLY HAVE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON A CA THAT'S A SUITABLE TO OUR COLLEAGUES AND SUITABLE TO STAKEHOLDERS THEN GO TO THE VOTERS AND AND SO -- WHICH WOULD LIKELY BE A TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AS OF I'M KIND OF LAYING IT OUT THERE IN A REASONABLE TIME LINE THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE A RELATIVELY QUICK TIMELINE AND SO I THINK WITHIN THE FIVE YEAR PLAN APPEARED THAT THE WAIVER PROCESS ALLOWS FOR -- IS PROBABLY THE THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT WOULD TAKE TO GET A PROGRAM UP AND RUNNING AND THAT'S IF EVERYTHING WENT WELL THANK YOU SO DID I SO DO YOU ANTICIPATE THE ACA NOT MOVING FORWARD THIS YEAR DID I HEAR THAT CORRECTLY END OF THE DAY YOU KNOW WE HAVE OUR CHAIRED REVENUE TAXATION HERE WE HAVE A LOT OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS THAT WE HAVE TO BE A STAKEHOLDERS WITHOUT THE ENGAGE WITH BUT ULTIMATELY EVEN IF IT WERE TO GO FORWARD THAT DOESN'T MEAN NESTLE GOES ON ABOUT THIS YEAR HE'S HE'S CAN BE SET FOR DIFFERENT -- DIFFERENT TIME PERIODS AND SO ULTIMATELY THE WAY THAT THIS HAS BEEN SET UP AS IN A MANNER THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE LEARNED FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN TERMS OF THE TIMELINE OF WHAT NEEDS TO GO FIRST WITHOUT A POLICY NOTHING CAN GO FORWARD AND THAT'S WHY EIGHTY FOURTEEN HUNDRED MOVING FORWARD AT THIS MOMENT -- IS THE MOST CRITICAL STEP FIRST STEP TO ALLOW FOR THE ACA THAN TO BE MORE PROBABLY DISCUSS BECAUSE AGAIN AS I MENTIONED MY INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS -- THE POLICY AND GOING THROUGH A WAIVER PROCESS HELPS TO INFORM THE FUNDING PIECE AS WELL SO -- I WANT TO GO BACK TO -- MISTER BURSON MISTER BARCELONA'S COMMENTS ABOUT AMERICA THE THE REP THE ORGANIZATION REPRESENTS A PEACHY -- AND IT HE HE TALKS ABOUT -- TALKED ABOUT THE -- THE WAY THEY PROVIDE CARE OF WHICH IS MORE GLOBAL IN NATURE MEDICARE PROGRAM IS GONNA GOING IN THAT DIRECTION YET WE WE KIND OF HAVE YOU HAVE A FEE FOR SERVICE COMPONENT HERE AND A SALARY COMPONENT AND THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY CONSISTENT WITH THE WAY HEALTH CARE IS IS INVOLVING ON ON A LARGE SCALE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN MILLION PEOPLE IN MEDICARE WE'RE WE WE'VE MOVED AWAY FROM FEE FOR SERVICE SO HOW DO YOU ADDRESS MR BARCELONA'S CONCERNS IT IS UP AS LAID OUT IN THE LEGISLATION ALLOWS FOR A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TYPES INCLUDING GLOBAL BUDGETING PARTICULARLY FOR OF ENTITIES SEVEN HOSPITALS WHAT HAVE YOU -- AND I'LL PASS IT OVER TO COMMON COMES TO YOU AS A PLAYER ROUTED TO ANSWERING GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU CAN STILL HAVE FEE FOR SERVICE AS PART OF THE OVERALL MENU OF OPTIONS OF PAYMENT PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IN COMMUNITIES THAT MAY NOT HAVE A HOSPITAL OR MAY NOT HAVE ENTITIES WERE THE GLOBAL BUDGETING MAKES AS MUCH SENSE HELLO IS MISS COMES DOWN THE LINE CAN YOU HEAR ME YES HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME YES OUR -- SO THE ASSUMPTION THAT -- THAT THE RISK BASED MODEL OF MANAGED CARE -- THAT IT IS A MODEL THAT WE SHOULD KEEP ON PUSHING FORWARD AND EXPAND IN CALIFORNIA IS IS ONE THAT WE SHOULD REALLY QUESTION BECAUSE THAT THE IDEAS MANAGED CARE THAT YOU KNOW WE CAN DO COST SAVINGS BY -- INTEGRATING THAT FINANCIAL INTEREST OF A PLAN AND WITH THE FINANCIAL INTEREST OF A PROVIDER THAT CREATES A FUNDAMENTALLY ETHICAL QUESTION WE'RE ASKING PROVIDERS TO -- TO WAIT THE FINANCIAL LIABILITY OF PROVIDING CARE -- WITH HOW THEY ACTUALLY PROVIDE CARE SO THIRD THROUGH THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION THERE AND I THINK WE CAN ASSUME THAT MANAGED CARE IS NECESSARILY GOING TO GET US TO TO UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO TAKE CARE AND IMPORTANTLY -- YOU KNOW MANAGED CARES REALLY TOUTED AS A SOME SORT OF COST SAVINGS AND -- MODEL OR SOME MODEL THAT WOULD IMPROVE CARE BUT BOTH OF THOSE THINGS HAVE BEEN -- HAD NOT BORNE OUT IN PRACTICE -- AND I I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO -- EMPHASIZED THAT -- THAT THE COST SAVINGS POTENTIAL FOR A DIRECT PAYMENTS MODEL THAT INCLUDES GLOBAL BUDGETING INCLUDES THAT FEE FOR SERVICE AT THAT INCLUDES A MIX OF THESE TYPES OF DIRECT PAYMENT MODELS AND I SERVE ON THE HEALTHY CALIFORNIA FOR ALL COMMISSION AND WE DISCUSSED THIS AT LENGTH COMMISSION HAVE FOUND THAT THE WOULD ACTUALLY SAVE MORE THAN A MANAGED CARE MODEL IN TERMS OF COST SAVINGS SO -- AT THAT IS A REALLY KEEP OUR QUESTION TO ALWAYS KEEP IN MIND ONE PICK ONE FOLKS SAY THAT IT WOULD SAVE CALIFORNIA MORE MONEY TO EXPAND MANAGED CARE ON THE SUBSTANTIVE MATTER OF MANAGED CARE YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY THE MODEL IS BASED ON A RISK BASED TYPE OF -- INCENTIVE PAYMENT -- WE'RE REALLY RELYING ON THAT THE INSURERS AND THE PLANS -- TO TWO WOMEN AT THE KNIGHT CARE IN ORDER -- -- IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE -- THEIR PROFIT MARGINS AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO GO AWAY FROM -- WITH OUR HOSPITAL GLOBAL BUDGETING AND THE SALARY PAYMENTS ALONG WITH IF YOU FOR SERVICE -- PAYMENTS SO -- BUILDER LARGELY -- QUESTIONS THAT THAT REALLY -- CHANGING THE PAYMENT MODEL ON CHANGING THE PAYMENT STRUCTURE IS HOW WE GETTING -- PAYMENTS TOWARDS CARE RATHER THAN -- BLOWING TOWARDS THINGS OTHER THAN CARE AND WE HAVE LOTS OF STUDIES THIS STUDY -- FROM -- OUR CONSULTANTS ON THE COMMISSION THESE EXTRA PAYMENT -- THESE ABOVE -- WHAT IS ACTUALLY PAID FOR CARE IN MANAGED CARE MODELS -- PARTICULARLY AND MEDICARE ADVANTAGE MODELS AS AS AN EXAMPLE THEY ACTUALLY GO TOWARDS -- HOSPITAL PROFIT MARGINS AND NOT BACK TOWARDS PATIENTS SO THERE ISN'T REALLY PROOF THAT MANAGED CARE REALLY EFFECTIVELY GET MORE CARE OR THAT IT COMPENSATES COST FOR THE FOR THE STATE OKAY -- THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT FOR THAT ANSWER -- HOW DO YOU ENVISION MAKE WHO COULD YOU ENVISION ADMINISTERING FOR THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF OF THIS ARE YOU OPEN TO AN ENTITY LIKE COVERED CALIFORNIA OR OR DO YOU ENVISION A A DEDICATED STATE AGENCY TO TO TO ADMINISTER THIS THIS PLAN YES -- UNDER THE LEGISLATION IT WOULD SET UP THE CAL CARE BOARD THAT ARE APPOINTEES HOWEVER IT DOES NOT LIMIT THEIR ABILITY TO HAVE YOU KNOW OTHER KIND OF AT THAT THE OTHER ENTITIES OR OTHER BOARDS OR SUBCOMMITTEE'S TOP OPERATED AND I THINK THAT RIGHT NOW IT DOES ALLOW FOR YOU THEY'RE ALREADY JUST LIKE AN APARTMENT MANAGE HEALTHCARE OR WHAT HAVE YOU THERE'S NO REASON WHY THE EXISTING ENTITIES THAT CURRENTLY EXIST CAN ALSO BE PART OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE SYSTEM AND THAT'S SOMETHING WHERE YOU KNOW THE THE CAL CARE BOARD CAN HELP TO DEVISE THE SET UP THAT ALLOWS FOR THAT AND I WOULD ASK MISS KANSI TO MOVE INTO ALLOWED RIGHT ON THAT AS WELL SURE -- I THINK WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW WHO WOULD BE ABLE TO MANAGE THE PROGRAM YOU KNOW WE'RE REALLY GIVING FLEXIBILITY AND IN THE THE BILL -- FOR THE POOR PROTECT YOU KNOW INCORPORATE IF NECESSARY -- EXISTING GOVERNMENT STRUCTURES AND -- OUR OUR OUR OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES OFFICES THAT ALREADY EXIST -- FOR EXAMPLE I THINK A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE IS THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE -- AS I MENTIONED IN MY TESTIMONY REVIEWS -- THAT THE BOARD WOULD CONSULT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE SO YOU KNOW IT IS NOT PART WE COULD TRY TO BRING IN THE THE SYSTEMS THAT EXIST ALREADY -- AND AND NOT NECESSARILY RECREATE THE REGULATORY WILL -- AND YOU KNOW FOR THE MHC -- THAT WHAT WOULD BE HAPPENING THERE IS THAT YOU KNOW INSTEAD OF MANAGING A HUNDRED PLUS PLANS -- THE PEOPLE MANAGING ONE PLANNED SO YOU KNOW THAT THEIR STRUCTURES THERE -- YOU KNOW WERE ALSO AT AND MANY PART TIME IN THE BILL WE REFER TO EXISTING STATUTE AGAIN LIKE MEDICAID THE MEDIC HOW -- CONSUMER PROTECTIONS TRYING TO BUILD OFF OF WHAT WE HAVE AND AND OF COURSE THERE'S THERE'S YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS WORKING THAT WE WANT TO BRING IT INTO THE ACCOUNT HERE PROGRAM OKAY THANK YOU AND -- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY OUR ANALYSIS LAYS OUT A LOT A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND AND MY COMMENTS BUT I WANT FOR THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE SOME COMMENTS AND SO I THINK THE COMMITTEE FURTHER INDULGENCE THIS IS A -- OBVIOUSLY A LONG HEARING BUT THIS IS I THINK A VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC AND THAT IS A SIMPLE QUESTION ABOUT PORTABILITY WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU'RE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA AND HAVE CAL CARE AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE AND THE REASON I ASK THIS QUESTION IS THAT IF YOU'RE A CITIZEN OF CANADA AND COME HERE YOUR COVERAGE IS VERY LIMITED FOR EXAMPLE -- IF YOU GET FIFTY DOLLARS FOR EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR A HOUSE OF THE DAY FOR A HOSPITAL STAY SIMILAR IN IN IN THAT THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE AND IN THE U. K. SO HOW DO YOU ENVISION WHAT DO YOU ENVISION FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA WHO TRAVEL TO ANOTHER STATE ON BUSINESS OR VACATION OR WHATEVER ALSO THAT THE SOUL OF HEALTHCARE CONTEMPLATES THAT IN ORDER TO QUALIFY YOU DO HAVE TO BE A RESIDENT OF OF CALIFORNIA HOWEVER ALLOWS UP TO NINETY DAYS -- MOVE FOR TRAVEL SOMEWHERE IF YOU GO TO BUSINESS WHAT HAVE YOU THAT YOU WOULD STILL BE -- YOU STILL QUALIFY FOR A PLAN CARE UNDER CAL CARE IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT THE PAYMENTS ARE MADE FROM THE CAUCUS SYSTEM TO COVER ANY UNEXPECTED MEDICAL EVENT THAT WOULD OCCUR OKAY WELL I'M GONNA I'M GONNA GO INTO MY COMMENTS NO NINE I SUSPECT MY COMMITTEE MY COMMITTEE MEMBERS WILL HAVE QUESTIONS AS WELL SO -- YOU KNOW I BEEN INVOLVED IN HEALTH CARE YOU KNOW MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE -- I CHOSE TO PRACTICE DENTISTRY IN A SMALL TOWN IN A RURAL COMMUNITY BECAUSE OF THE REALLY HIGH NEED THEIR MEDICAL PROVIDER -- AS WELL I WISH I COULD HAVE TAKEN MORE CARE MORE I GAVE AWAY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO CARRY YEAR BECAUSE IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO I TOOK AN OATH WHEN I I GOT MY LICENSE AND GRADUATE FROM DENTAL SCHOOL THE TO PUT THE PATIENT FIRST AND I'VE ALWAYS DONE THAT AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE IS TO PUT PATIENTS FIRST CONSUMERS FIRST I FEEL LIKE THE ENTIRE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IS KIND OF FORGOTTEN THAT OATH AND LOST ITS WAY WE LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE PROFITS SHORT TERM LONG TERM WHATEVER SEEM TO BE THE DRIVING MOTIVATION FOR AN ENTIRE SYSTEM CALIFORNIANS NEED QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE THERE BEYOND IMPATIENT THEY'RE ANGRY THEY'RE SCARED AND THEY'RE DESPERATE I THINK YOU HEARD SOME OF THAT THIS EVENING I THINK THEIR ANGER IS JUSTIFIED WE NEED TO HEAR THEM AND WE NEED TO RESPOND YOU HEARD FOR THOSE OF YOU WERE LISTENING -- EARLIER THANK AT THE PIPE I ACTUALLY TEXTED MR DAILY TO MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND THAT I WASN'T LASHING OUT AT HIM IN HIS BILL AB NINE THIRTY THREE BUT I'M LASHING OUT AT THE SYSTEM THE SYSTEM HAS A PERVERSE INCENTIVE ON MEDICATIONS IT'S CRAZY THAT A DRUG MANUFACTURER PRODUCES A DRUG AND THEN A MIDDLEMAN DECIDES IF IT CAN GO ON YOUR FORMULARY SO THAT YOU AS A CONSUMER CAN GET IT AND WE KNOW FROM OUR RESEARCH THAT THOSE MIDDLEMAN THE PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS TAKE THE HIGHEST PRICED DRUGS BECAUSE THEY GET THE BIGGEST REBATES FOR THAT NOT THE LOWEST LOWER PRICED DRUGS IT MAY BE MORE EFFECTIVE THEY TAKE THE HIGH ONES BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THEY MAKE THEIR MONEY IT IS NO ACCIDENT THAT THE THREE LARGEST PBMS IN THE UNITED STATES WITH TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF BUSINESS OUR FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES ANYWAY ORIGINALLY THEY WERE DESIGNED IN A WAY TO ACTUALLY BRING A VALUE BUT SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY THEY WENT OFF IN A DIRECTION THAT ISN'T HELPFUL FOR CONSUMERS CAN I HAVE A I'M A FAMILY MEMBER WHO -- YOU KNOW CALLED ME AND SAID HEY I'M GONNA HAVE TO HAVE TO HAVE SOME SURGERY AND -- -- HOW DO I FIND OUT HOW MUCH IT'S GONNA COST AND I SAID WELL YOU CAN TALK YOU CAN ASK YOUR DOCTOR AND I SAID -- AND I SAID AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO HOUSE THE HEALTH FACILITY WAIT THE OUTPATIENT SURGERY CENTER WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO GET THAT AND BY THE WAY YOU MIGHT NOT MEET THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST UNTIL THE DAY OF THE SURGERY SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE THAT ONE OUT WE PUT OUR FAITH IN THE SYSTEM AND WE DON'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT IS GOING TO COST TO ME GO WHAT ELSE IN OUR WORLD DO WE ACTUALLY DO -- WHERE THAT WILL BE DUE THAT WE PUT TREMENDOUS FAITH IN THE SYSTEM AND OUR WONDERFUL PROVIDERS HOSPITALS PROVIDE INCREDIBLE SERVICES DRUG COMPANIES PROVIDE INCREDIBLE LIFESAVING DRUGS DOCTORS DO WONDERFUL THINGS TO HELP SAVE LIVES YEAH WE CAN'T TELL PEOPLE WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST YOU KNOW THERE WAS A BILL PASSED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LAST YEAR THAT SAID THAT HOSPITALS NEED TO DISPLAY THEIR PRIDE THERE THEIR PRICES IF THE TRANSPARENCY BILLS A YEAR LATER HALF OF THE HOSPITALS IT EITHER IGNORED THAT WERE BURIED SO DEEP THAT THE AVERAGE CONSUMER CAN'T FIND IT WE'RE JUST DECIDED THAT THE FINES ARE WORTH THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT DRIVE ME ABSOLUTELY CRAZY IT FEELS MORE AND MORE THAT WE ARE SECOND WE ARE SACRIFICING TO HELP THE PATIENTS AND THEIR PRIORITIES FOR PRESERVING THE STATUS QUO IN OUR INSURANCE COMPANIES TELL PEOPLE WHAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT HALF THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES CONTINUE TO INCREASE PRICES AND MY FRUSTRATION WITH THE BILL THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER IS THERE IS NO INCENTIVE FOR THE DRUG COMPANIES TO ACTUALLY LOWER PRICES AND I FEAR THAT THE POLICY MIX WOULD DRIVE PEOPLE MORE TOWARDS HIGH PRICE DRUGS RATHER THAN GENERICS THAT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY MIGHT GET A REBATE THAT'S A PERVERSE INCENTIVE POTENTIALLY AND WE'LL SEE HOW THAT COULD HAVE THAT PLAYS OUT OBVIOUSLY I JUST SAT HOSPITALS IGNORE TRANSPARENCY LAWS -- PHYSICIANS DON'T WANT THEIR DECISIONS QUESTION BY ANYONE AND THAT'S CERTAIN THAT'S A REALITY I SPENT SEVEN YEARS IN THE LEGISLATURE TRYING TO MAKE IT WORK FOR PATIENTS SPENT TWENTY SEVEN YEARS BEFORE THAT DELIVERING DIRECT PATIENT CARE THE BATTLES IN THIS BUILDING HAVE BEEN BRUTAL AND ALTHOUGH WE'VE HAD SIGNIFICANT SUCCESSES EACH ONE OF THE PLAYERS IN A MAJOR PIECE ELECTION LEGISLATION THAT I TAKE THAT I'VE ACCOMPLISHED HAVE BEEN REWARDED WITH A LAWSUIT TO DELAY THE IMPLEMENTATION ONE REGULAR OR FORTY OR CONTINUING REGULATORY CHALLENGES TO DELAY THE IMPLEMENTATION SO THEY CAN KEEP CONTINUE THESE PRACTICES AND PROTECT THEIR PROFITS FIXING INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS OF THE SYSTEM AND HOPING IT IMPROVES THE WHOLE NO LONGER SEEMS TO BE AN EFFECTIVE APPROACH THAT'S WHY AFTER NEARLY EIGHT YEARS OF TRYING TO MAKE HEALTH CARE WORK FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS SOMETHING HAS TO GIVE AND JUST MAYBE A SINGLE HEALTH SINGLE PAYER HEALTH CAN BE THE CATALYST FOR THAT CHANGE I SPOKEN WITH ENOUGH OF MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES TO KNOW THAT THEY TO BELIEVE THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN AND I AM OPEN TO WHAT THEY MIGHT HAVE A SOLUTION FOR ANYBODY WHO OPPOSES WHAT'S HAPPENING OFFERS A SOLUTION NO IS NOT THE ANSWER I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES IN MY CAREER FROM THIS DíAS AND FROM MY OFFICE I'VE ACTUALLY SAID THAT I DO HAVE CONCERNS YEP I'VE SHARED WITH YOU IS THE AS AN AUTHOR YOU SEE THE CONCERNS IN THE IN THE ANALYSIS AND MANY AND AND I'M SURE THE SIMILAR CONCERNS WITH YOUR MANAGER CO AUTHORS I HOPE YOU GIVE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION TO TO ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES THEY ARE REAL ISSUES AND THEY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IF WE ARE GOING TO MOVE THIS POLICY FORWARD -- TOO I THINK THIS WILL SOLVE ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS NOW THAT'S WHY I CONTINUE TO WORK HARD THIS YEAR TO PASS AB ELEVEN THIRTY WHICH WILL CREATE THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THIS TO ADDRESS HEALTH CARE COST SAVINGS BY HAVING EVERY SEGMENT OF THE HEALTH CARE IMPROVE IT IS SYSTEM PROVIDE INFORMATION ON COSTS AND USE THAT INFORMATION TO ESTABLISH ENFORCEABLE COST TARGETS ANY MAJOR HEALTH CARE REFORM AND WE LEARNED THIS FROM FORMER GOVERNOR PETER SHUMLIN -- WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WE NEED HARD POWER SPENDING OUR MONEY WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO BEND THE COST CURVE FROM INCREASING -- THAT'S THE KIND OF INFORMATION THAT WILL HELP US IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS AND WE DESPERATELY NEED A SYSTEM WHERE YOU TRAVEL TO ANOTHER PART OF THE STATE AND YOUR WAY FOR YOUR DOCTOR THAT SOMEBODY ON THE OTHER RENT COULD SAY OH THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED AND AND WITHOUT HAVING TO RUN COUNTLESS TESTS THAT THAT THAT PLACE NO VALUE THERE THAT'S BASIC THAT'S BASIC BASIC INFORMATION IN YET HEALTHCARE ENTITIES FIGHT THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP THE INFORMATION THEY DON'T WANT TO COOPERATE BECAUSE AS PART OF THEIR BUSINESS MODEL TO PROTECT WHAT THEY CONSIDER PROPRIETARY THAT IS NOT THE KIND OF THING THAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF PATIENTS AND THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT THAT ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO AND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE SO YOU HAVE OUR ANALYSIS WHAT WE POINT OUT A REAL CHALLENGES AND I DON'T HAVE THE SOLUTIONS FOR THOSE AT THIS POINT BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD THOSE SOLUTIONS NEED TO BE CONSIDERED AT SOLUTIONS TO THOSE ISSUES NEED TO BE CONSIDERED AND -- BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY OBVIOUSLY -- AND -- LIKE TO MOVE MOVE UP AND GET MY UP MY UP FELLOW COMMITTEE MEMBERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS AND MAKE A STATEMENT MISCREANT I I DON'T I I WON'T WITH THE BILL SOMEONE ELSE WITH THE BILL THAT'S JUST THE PROCESS HERE BY SOMEBODY WANTS TO MOVE THE BILL PLEASE GO AHEAD ISRAEL WAS A BILL MISTER NAZARIAN SECONDS A BILL MISTER MISTER OF COMMENT IN THE QUESTION AND MISTER NAZARIAN I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW IF MISTER EIGHTY PARKING IS STILL ON THE LINE I HAD A QUESTION FOR HIM SPECIFICALLY THE MESSAGE TO THE CHAIR IS MISTER BARTON IS ALREADY BACK ON THE LINE STILL HI THIS IS CARMEN AND I AM HERE WITH BODY AND IT'LL TEST IF YOU COULD COME BACK HIM IN A COUPLE MINUTES WITH YOUR QUESTION HE IS STILL ON THE LINE OKAY SO YOU JUST NEED A COUPLE MINUTES OKAY THANK YOU CENTER COMPLETED OKAY WE'LL WE'LL COME BACK TO MISS CARILLO THAT MISTER NAZARIAN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS -- FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU -- TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD THANK YOU FOR ASKING ME TO JOIN YOU IN YOUR EFFORTS AS WELL I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS AND AND AND IN PREVIOUS ITERATIONS WE WERE COLLABORATING AT DIFFERENT BILL AS WELL -- AND AGAIN MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR DUE DILIGENCE AND WANTING TO SEE THIS MOVE FORWARD AND FOR THE TIME YOU'VE SPENT AN AND IN WORKING ON THIS I'VE ALONG WITH MAYBE ABOUT TWO OR THREE OTHER COLLEAGUES HERE HAVE BEEN ON HEALTH COMMITTEE FOR NINE YEARS AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WHEN ELECTED I WANTED TO SERVE ON THIS COMMITTEE WAS EXACTLY TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT GAP BETWEEN QUALITY CARE AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESS THE THE THREE MAIN IMPORTANT PILLARS OF MAKING HEALTHCARE WORK IN OUR STATE IN OUR COUNTRY BUT AT LEAST IN OUR STATE AND AND SO IF I VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR THE TIME -- YOU'VE PUT INTO THIS BECAUSE I'VE BEEN IN MANY COUNTLESS HOURS OF HERE EDUCATIONAL HEARINGS INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS WHERE WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT SOMETIMES THE DOWNSIDE OF OUR HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY AS WELL IN THE STATE AND THE HIGH PERCENTAGE ALSO OF SOMETIMES NOT WILL SPEND DOLLARS -- AND SO -- YOU'VE HAD THE BENEFIT OF OF OF KNOWING THAT -- AND THEN FORCED TO LEARN BETTER FROM THESE HEARINGS SO WITHOUT BELIEVE BRING THE POINT -- IBM THE THE ONLY OTHER THING BY THE WAY THAT ACTUALLY I WANTED TO ADD TO THE COMMENTS THAT YOU WERE MAKING MISTER CHAIR OF THOSE THREE PBMS LET'S NOT FORGET THAT ONE OF THEM IS OWNED BY AN INSURANCE COMPANY AS WELL SO IT'S A REMARKABLE THAT THE VERY INDUSTRY THAT IS COVERING THE HEALTHCARE COSTS IS ALSO IN THE BUSINESS OF OWNING A NEGOTIATING ARM THAT THEN -- -- THAT THAT THAT TAKES THOSE VERY BENEFITS AWAY FROM THE CONSUMERS THAT ALTERNATELY SHOULD BE BENEFITING FROM SO I WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THIS BILL AND THE CONCEPT I KNOW THAT CHANGE IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT -- AND AND ALSO IMPLEMENTING SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS GONNA TAKE SOME TIME SO I'M FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS -- THANK YOU AGAIN FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD -- AND I DO WANT TO SAY THAT -- ONE OF THE INSPIRATIONS FOR HEALTH CARE FOR ME WAS A LOCAL CONSTITUENT BY THE NAME OF JOHN GLASS WHO PASSED AWAY THE YEAR THAT I RAN FOR OFFICE -- AND THAT IT HAD BEEN HIS LIFE'S MISSION TO -- MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE WAS -- DID GET HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AND SO TO HIS -- -- I JUST WANTED TO SHOUT AT HIM AND HIS WONDERFUL WIFE JUDITH CLASS OF WHO IS STILL WITH US AND -- -- I WANTED TO SUPPORT THIS BILL IN HIS MEMORY AND HIS THIS ISSUE SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD THANK YOU MR FOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND -- IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY SO I'M GONNA KEEP MY COMMENTS I KNOW THERE'S MORE QUESTIONS COMING BUT I DO WANT TO DRESS THE THE LABOR ASPECT OF THIS FOR A LONG TIME TOGETHER AND I KNOW YOUR COMMITMENT TO WORKERS AND WORKERS RIGHTS AND HAS NEVER BEEN DEBATED BUT I AM VERY CONCERNED HOW DO YOU RECTIFY TAKING AWAY ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES THAT LABOUR FUSES IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING NEGOTIATING THEIR HEALTHCARE THROUGH THAT SYSTEM AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE'RE IN THE STRIP THAT FROM THEM AND WE'RE GONNA PUT HIM ON A STATE RUN PROGRAM AND THERE'S COUNTLESS STORIES I MEAN I'VE GOT FAMILY MEMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN UNION DISH TENDERS STAYED IN THAT JOB BECAUSE THEIR WIVES HAD M. S. RETIRED ABOUT A DECADE AGO SO WE'RE GONNA GO BACK TO A FAMILY MEMBER AND SAY CONGRATULATIONS YOU'RE GONNA BE ON A REGULAR PLAN THERE'S NOTHING THERE'S NO INCENTIVE THERE'S NO PROTECTIONS FOR THAT WHAT ABOUT THE CALPERS MEMBERS IT MOVED OUT OF STATE WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO PEOPLE THIS SPEND THEIR ENTIRE LIVES IN INTO THE SYSTEM AND WE'RE GOING TO RIP THE CARPET OUT FROM UNDERNEATH THEM FOR A PROGRAM THERE IS EVEN FUND WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A CLUE WHAT THIS THING'S GONNA COST BECAUSE WE HAVE AN ALLOW THE BUILDING TO DO A COST ANALYSIS ON THE SOME I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS THERE IS SO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS AND THERE IS A LOT OF INCREDIBLY SMART PEOPLE THAT I THINK CAN FIGURE IT OUT BUT IF WE CARE ABOUT WORKERS LIKE I KNOW THAT WE DO HOW ON EARTH DO WE GO BACK TO THEM AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT NOW WE'RE GONNA CUT TO PENSIONS NO THAT'S LIKE A IT'S A IT'S A PRINCIPLE WE WOULD NEVER GO DOWN BUT WE'RE DOING IT FOR THE HEALTH CARE AND FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THEIR RETIREMENT NOT ONLY THESE PEOPLE ON A FIXED INCOME RIGHT NOW WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO SO I GUESS DO THEY HAVE AN ABILITY TO KEEP THE CARE THAT THEY WALK THAT THEY HAVE NOW SO HOW SICK OF THESE I DO APPRECIATE YOUR RECOGNITION OF OF MY COMMITMENT TO WORKERS OBVIOUSLY IS CHAIR LABOR WE BOTH -- BUT A LOT OF WORK IN THAT REGARD -- CALVET LABOR FEDERATION DOESN'T DOORS AND SUPPORT AB FOURTEEN HUNDRED PART OF THAT IS A COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH LABOR -- GOING FOR NOT GOING FOR THE OPTION IT WITH MANY TIMES OF OF OVER THE MONTHS BUT THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS ON A READ UP ON THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO NEGOTIATE ABSOLUTELY BUT THIS REMEMBER BUT WITH LEGISLATIVE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE NEGOTIATED IT'LL MEAN BY THAT IS IF YOU HAVE GUARANTEED QUALITY CARE WHAT I WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL SPENT OVER HALF OUR TIME THE GOSHEN COPAYS PREMIUMS AND TRYING TO KEEP THE COSTS DOWN IF THAT IS OFF THE TABLE BECAUSE YOU HAVE HIGH QUALITY CARE THE NOW YOU CAN GO SHAVE OTHER THINGS SO THAT'S THAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH IN TERMS OF NEGOTIATING CURRENT CONTRACT I'M NOT TALK ABOUT FUTURE NEGOTIATIONS LITTLE I UNDERSTAND ABOUT THINGS HAVE ALREADY BEEN NEGOTIATED BY THE THERE'S ANOTHER POINT YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MENTION NEGOTIATIONS I WANT TO MENTION THAT SECONDLY SAYING -- PEOPLE STAY IN THE JOB BECAUSE THEY HAVE GOOD HEALTH CARE THAT'S A PROBLEM THAT SHOULD BE THE IDEAL THAT SOMEONE STAYS IN THEIR JOB BECAUSE OF THE LEAVE IT THEY LOSE THEIR HEALTHCARE THAT'S A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH EMPLOYER BASED HEALTH CARE IN OUR COUNTRY UNION OR NOT IS THAT IF YOU LEAVE YOUR JOB YEAH YOU YOU STAY WITH YOUR JOB BECAUSE YOU ALONG WITH YOUR HEALTH CARE IS A MAJOR FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM BUT OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM NOW WHEN IT COMES TO THOSE THAT ALREADY HAVE HEALTH CARE AND HAVE HEALTHCARE GUARANTEED ABSOLUTELY THOSE ARE THINGS WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE SAME ACCESS SAME QUALITY OF CARE AND THE REALITY IS UNDER CAL CARE WHAT IS BEING WHAT IS BEING PUT FORTH AND CAL CARE AND THE LEVEL AND THE OF THE RANGE OF SERVICES INCLUDING LONG TERM CARE OR ARE OUR TOP ITS COMPREHENSIVE CARE TO EVERYONE NOT JUST TO SOMEONE THAT MAY HAVE A GOOD PLAN OR A BAD PLAN OR TO A LABOR CAMP PLAN BUT ONE THING WE WILL WORK AND AND IN TERMS OF OUT OF STATE ALL THAT THOSE ARE ON CALPERS THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE WILL ALSO TALK WITH LABOR ABOUT TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE NOT LEAVING ANYONE OUT THAT IS EARNED THAT IS EARNED THOSE BENEFITS BUT ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT WE ARE WORKING ON CONTINUE TO DO SO -- BURKE OF LABOR ON THE ALREADY HAS SOME CONVERSATIONS ON IT ALREADY OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS ARE THERE ON HEALTH TRUST FUNDS WHICH IS ANOTHER ISSUE IF THOSE DO GET IS ALL YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY GET DISSOLVED AND FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE WORKERS I'M NOT THE EMPLOYERS ARE AS THOSE IN A WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES THAT UP THAT APPLIES TO LABOR OTHER I'M VERY WELL AWARE OF THAT WE'VE ALREADY STARTED CONVERSATIONS ON ARE GOING TO GET YOU TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ON TO MAKE SURE WHETHER IT'S A CURRENT UNION EMPLOYEE OR RETIREE THAT THEY'RE NOT LEFT HOLDING THE BAG THEY DON'T LOSE OUT ON ANYTHING THEY HAVE A GREAT QUALITY CARE AND ULTIMATELY IF FUNDS ARE IN SOME WAY DISSOLVED IS RESOLVED IN A WAY THAT'S BENEFICIAL TO THE WORKER SO IS THERE A PROVISION IN FOURTEEN HUNDRED RIGHT NOW THAT ALLOWS THEM TO KEEP THE CARE THAT THEY HAVE NOW THE IMPORTANT IN EIGHTY FOUR TWO HUNDRED EVERYONE WILL BE ON THE COUNTER OKAY SO IT IS GOING TO CHANGE THAT WELL YOU CAN'T WE DON'T KNOW I MEAN WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE GOING TO PASS A POTENTIALLY PASS A PIECE OF LEGISLATION OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE TODAY AND THROW A COMPLETE MONKEY WRENCH AND A TON OF UNCERTAINTY INTO THAT ALREADY THE SYSTEM IS ALREADY GOT A TON OF UNCERTAINTY IN IT RIGHT NOW SO NOW WE'RE GONNA THROW THIS ON TOP OF IT WITH NO FUNDING SOURCE OUR UNION FRIENDS ARE GONNA BE WONDERING WHAT ON EARTH THEY'RE GOING TO DO IN THE FUTURE WE'RE ADDING INSULT TO INJURY AND IF THERE IS SOMETHING THAT WE COULD DO LIKE WHY ISN'T THE FUNDING SOURCE IN HERE LET'S HAVE THAT CONVERSATION IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS LET'S DO IT BUT OTHERWISE WE'RE JUST GONNA PASS OUT PUT EVERYBODY IN A BAD SPOT FOR WHAT FOR WHAT FOR A PRESS RELEASE I'M SORRY BUT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A AND A LITTLE BIT -- THERE'S A REASON IT WAS TABLE FOR NUMBER OF YEARS THE REASON IT WASN'T AND RULES FOR A LONG TIME AND HERE WE ARE AGAIN AND NOW WE'RE MOVING FORWARD AND I UNDERSTAND THAT WE CAN HAVE THIS CONVERSATION A LOT BECAUSE I DO ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THE MEN AND WOMEN THAT SERVE OUR STATE -- AND ALSO JUST BE FOR THE PUBLIC SAFETY SIDE OF THINGS LIKE THERE IS NO CHANCE THAT WE SHOULD FEEL GOOD ABOUT PASSAGE ANYTHING COMING OUT OF THIS BUILDING THAT'S GOING TO RIP THE CARPET OUT FROM UNDERNEATH HER LEGS WHEN THEY SPENT AN ENTIRE CAREER PROTECTING EACH EVERYONE'S BUT THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN THAT'S ALSO NOT GONNA HAPPEN ONLY TO THERE'S THERE'S TWO POINTS OF THAT OLDER SON IS THIS ISN'T GOING TO AFFECT AND TOLD THE FUNDING IS RESULT IT IS A IT IS THAT WAS INTENTIONALLY PUT INTO THE BILL TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE NOT TAKING SOMETHING AWAY WITHOUT ENSURING THAT WE HAVE THE SAME QUALITY OF CARE BETTER AVAILABLE -- AND SO THAT'S WHAT YOU KNOW AND THAT INCLUDES GO DISABILITY IT INCLUDES ALL THE ISSUES THAT SO MANY OF OUR PUBLIC SAFETY REPRESENT BY THE WAY IT'S GREAT TO SEE HOW PASSIONATE ABOUT WORKERS ARE HOPING TO BE LIKE THAT ON ALL OF BILLS THAT PROTECT WORKERS -- -- BUT -- YOU KNOW CONSTANT REGARDS TO BARGAINING OF FOURTEEN HUNDRED AS WELL IF YOU DON'T MIND RESEARCHER M. SO YOU DON'T TO ANSWER WHAT THE TIMELY MEMBER KALRA SAID YOU KNOW AND -- SOMEONE WHO REPRESENTS NURSES REPRESENTS UNION NURSES ACROSS THE STATE THE BARGAINING TABLE WOULD BE GAME CHANGING THE VAST MAJORITY OF STRIKES ARE ABOUT HEALTHCARE BENEFITS AS EMPLOYERS SHIFT MORE MORE COSTS ONTO WORKERS UNION WORKERS DURING CREEK PREMIUMS AND COPAYS ALL THE STRIKES WOULD END UNDER EIGHT FOURTEEN HUNDRED WORKERS WOULD HAVE MORE BARGAINING POWER IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR WORKERS BECAUSE WE COULD BARGAIN FOR BETTER WORKING CONDITIONS WHICH WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL FOR ALL OF THESE ESSENTIAL WORKERS WERE IN UNIONS WERE FIGHTING FOR CODE PROTECTIONS THIS WOULD MEAN YOU KNOW FOR MANY MANY PEOPLE WEEK WE COULD GET BETTER WORKING CONDITIONS BETTER -- WE COULD END THESE TYPES OF STRIKES THAT OUR OUR OUR EMPLOYERS ARE PUTTING HONEST AND TRYING TO -- LEAN DOWN THE THE POWER OF WORKERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND IT WOULD BE A BOON TO CALIFORNIA'S WORKERS AND ANSWERED PLAYERS BECAUSE IT WOULD SAVE ON PREMIUM BOTH ON THE EMPLOYER SIDE AND ON THE EMPLOYEE SIDE SO YOU KNOW IT WOULD BE A WIN WIN FOR BOTH WORKERS AND AND AND EMPLOYERS BECAUSE WE WILL AT THAT OFFER THE BARGAINING TABLE BUT I JUST HAVE ONE MORE FINAL COMMON WITH ALL DUE RESPECT LIKE THE STATE DOESN'T HAVE A REAL GREAT TRACK RECORD RECENTLY PROVIDING A BETTER SERVICE FOR WELL ANYTHING RIGHT NOW SO WHAT ARE HEALTHCARE IN THE STATE'S HANDS MEASURES AGREED PLAN I'M SORRY GO AHEAD GO AHEAD MR CUTTING HIM THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SIT IN A TODAY I WANT TO FOCUS ON TWO THINGS BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT MY CONSTITUENTS AND OUR SENIORS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DESERVE SOME ANSWERS TO SOME VERY FUNDAMENTAL AND VERY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS TO THEM ROUGHLY THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT OF MY CONSTITUENTS ARE ON MEDICARE I DON'T KNOW THE STATE MY NUMBER BUT IT'S PRETTY HIGH AND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ON IT AND PEOPLE ARE AGING INTO IT EVERY SINGLE DAY YOUR BILL AB FOURTEEN HUNDRED WOULD SUBSUME MEDICARE IT WOULD TAKE IT AWAY WOULD PUT EVERYTHING AS YOU STATED IN YOUR ANSWER THE LAST QUESTION I WOULD PUT EVERYTHING UNDER CALCULAR SO THAT RAISES SOME FUNDAMENTAL AND IMPORTANT QUESTIONS TO ME THE FIRST IS MEDICARE IS A IS A COMPACT IT'S AN INTERGENERATIONAL CONTACT SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE EVERYBODY THAT WORKS FROM YOUR FIRST JOB BACK AT MCDONALD'S OR STARBUCKS OR TARGET OR WHAT HAVE YOU ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL YOUR RETIREMENT YOU PAY A PAYROLL TAX AND YOUR EMPLOYER PAYS A PAYROLL TAX AND THAT MOSTLY FUNDS THE MEDICARE PROGRAM IN ADDITION TO SOME SUPPLEMENTAL GENERAL TAX REVENUES FROM CONGRESS SO YOU PAY INTO THAT AND IF YOU'RE NEARING THE AGE WHERE YOU QUALIFY TO MEDICARE OR YOU'RE ALREADY IN THE SYSTEM LIKE MY PARENTS FOR EXAMPLE YOU'VE PAID YOUR ENTIRE WORKING LIFE INTO THAT SYSTEM AND NOW IF I UNDERSTAND YOUR BILL CORRECTLY WHAT AB FOURTEEN HUNDRED WOULD DO IS SAY YOU DON'T GET MEDICARE ANYMORE IF YOU LIVE IN CALIFORNIA YOU'VE GOT TO BE UNDER CAL CARE AN UNTESTED UNTRIED EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM IN A STATE THAT BROUGHT YOU TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS A FRAUD WITH THE ET DE RECENTLY AN INTERMINABLE PROBLEMS WITH THE DMV GOING BACK THE ENTIRE TIME I'VE BEEN IN OFFICE SO THAT SEEMS LIKE A RAW DEAL FOR OUR SENIORS MEDICARE THEY'VE HAD FIFTY PLUS YEARS TO WORK THE KINKS OUT FOR GETTING MEDICARE BENEFITS PEOPLE AREN'T GENERALLY SPEAKING HAPPY WITH THEM THERE ARE SOME ISSUES THERE TOO THEY PAY THE TAXES TO FUND THAT IN THEIR ENTIRE WORKING LIFE HOW ARE THEY MADE WHOLE BECAUSE THEY ALREADY PAID FOR IT THEY'RE GETTING THE MEDICARE BENEFIT NOW AND NOW THAT'S TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM AND THEY'RE GETTING HANDED IF THEY STAY IN CALIFORNIA A LOT OF THEM LEAD BY THE WAY BUT THEY'RE GETTING HANDED A MASSIVE UNPRECEDENTED TAX INCREASE IN A PLAYER TO BE NAMED LATER IN WHICH IS CURRENTLY IF I UNDERSTAND AC ELEVEN SO BYE BYE BARGAINED FOR BENEFITS LIKE THE UNIONS IT'S A SIMILAR TYPE OF THING HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE THEM WHOLE THEY PAID DECADES INTO A SYSTEM THEY'RE GETTING CARE FOR THAT SYSTEM THEY FOUR WENT ADDITIONAL PAY BECAUSE THEY BARGAINED IN MANY MANY CASES TO HAVE BOTH PUBLIC SECTOR AND PRIVATE SECTOR UNION WORKERS THE BARGAIN TO TAKE LESS PAY AND IT IT IN ORDER TO GET BETTER HEALTH CARE AND NOW THAT'S BEING STRIPPED AWAY I DON'T SEE ANYTHING IN THIS BILL THAT MAKES THEM HOLE FOR THAT THAT SEEMS LIKE A VERY VERY RAW DEAL BOTH FOR OUR SENIORS ON MEDICARE AND THE OTHER QUESTION I'D LIKE YOU TO ADDRESSES YOU KNOW WHY DO WE THINK HEALTHCARE IS GOING TO BE BETTER THAN MEDICARE WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE A FEDERAL SYSTEM THAT'S FUNDED BY EVERYBODY IN THE COUNTRY THREE OR TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE FROM THE DAY THEY START WORKING TILL THE DAY THEY RETIRE AND AND THAT'S AN ASSURANCE TO THEM THAT'S A COMMITMENT THAT'S AN INTERGENERATIONAL COMMITMENT AND WE'VE BEEN GOING STRONG ON THAT FOR FIFTY FIVE PLUS YEARS SO WHY ARE WE DOING THIS OTHER THING IN CALIFORNIA AND REMOVING THAT FROM PEOPLE THEY DON'T GET A CHOICE THEY'RE JUST PUSHED IN THE CAL CARE THERE YOU GO HERE'S YOUR TAX BILL GOOD LUCK I JUST DON'T GET IT SO THE GOVERNMENT MAYBE IF YOU ACTUALLY READ CULTURE YOU UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BETTER I READ WHERE THE WILD AND THEN THEN YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS WHAT I'M MISSING I'M I'M I'M TRYING TO YOU OF MEDICARE AND MY FATHER'S ON MEDICARE HE HAS TO PAY EXTRA TO BE A MEDICARE ADVANTAGE AND STILL -- PAYS OUT OF POCKET FOR A NUMBER OF EXPENSES INCLUDING PHARMACEUTICALS HE HAS TO PAY ON HIS OWN FOR DENTAL AND VISION -- HE DOESN'T HAVE LONG TERM CARE THERE ANY ISSUES THAT ARE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY FOR CALCULAR COVERS ALL THOSE THINGS SO WHAT YOU SAY KICK ME OUT OF THIS KICK ME OUT OF THAT WHAT CALGARIANS IS ADDITIVE IT'S NOT SO SHOCKED OF WHAT SOMEONE GETS A MEDICARE ACTUALLY GET A WHOLE LOT MORE WITHOUT PAYING CO PAYS OR PREMIUMS OR DEDUCTIBLES OR PAYING FOR PHARMACEUTICALS OR PAYING FOR LONG TERM CARE AND SO WE CAN USE FEAR AND I UNDERSTAND THE FEAR IS A GREAT MOTIVATOR TO TRY TO GET PEOPLE TO NOT WANT TO CHANGE TOTALLY GET THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO SENIORS HIGH END OF THE THAT THAT'S A VERY COMMON REFRAINS IS TO USE FEAR BUT THE REALITY IS THAT IF YOU UNDERSTOOD OUR CURRENT MEDICARE SYSTEM ABOUT PEOPLE QUALIFY FOR AND LOOK NOT EVERYONE CAN AFFORD MEDICARE ADVANTAGE MY FATHER'S FORTUNE ENOUGH THAT HE CAN'T AND IF YOU CAN'T EVEN HAVE A LOT MORE EXPENSES AND WHAT HAPPENS IS SENIORS AND UP RATIONING AND MANY OF THEM DIED PREMATURELY BECAUSE THEY DON'T GET THE HEALTHCARE THEY NEED EVEN WITH MEDICARE MEDICARE IS A SAFETY NET MEDICARE'S NOT COMPREHENSIVE CARE NOT IN THE WAY THAT CALCAREOUS AND SO I WOULD SAY TO EVERYONE THAT NOT ONLY ARE YOU NOT AND AND AND IF YOU'RE ON MEDICARE -- THAT YOU'RE NOT WORKING YOU'RE NOT GETTING UP THE PAYROLL TAX NOT BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING TO IMPACT YOU IN FACT YOU COULD HAVE A CALL HUGE COST SAVINGS FOR NOT HAVING TO BUY SUPPLEMENTAL INSURANCE NOT TO BUY THAT OCCURRED VANTAGE NOT PAPER PHARMACEUTICALS NOT PAPER COPAYS AND PREMIUMS BUT IN ANY FORM OR FASHION AND SO THE END OF THE DAY YOU ARE HAVING A DRAMATIC COST SAVINGS WITHIN EXPANSION AND THE SERVICES PROVIDED TO YOU AND THAT'S WHAT CALCULATES OUT QUITE CLEARLY AND IF YOU UNDERSTOOD THAT MEDICARE IS NOT THIS COMPREHENSIVE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AS IT COULD BE AND SHOULD BE -- THEN YOU UNDERSTAND THAT CALCULATE ACTUALLY BE FAR BETTER FOR SENIORS THAT ARE ON MEDICARE MY OTHER QUESTION IS UP REGARDING THE IMPACT THIS BILL WOULD POTENTIALLY HAVE ON OUR ABILITY TO RECRUIT QUALIFIED MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS PROFESSIONALS TO MOVE TO CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S IMPORTANT ISSUE BECAUSE IT'S WELL WELL DOCUMENTED IN CERTAIN PLACES IN THE STATE BASICALLY EVERYWHERE THAT'S RURAL MOST OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY A LOT OF PLACES YOU CAN'T GET QUALIFIED DOCTORS NURSES TO MOVE HERE FOR PRACTICALLY ANYTHING IT'S INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT WE HAVE MASSIVE SHORTAGES WE HAVE A MAJOR MISMATCH BETWEEN THE DISTRIBUTION OF DOCTORS MEDICAL SPECIALISTS TO MEET PEOPLE WHERE I LIVE -- YOU KNOW THEY DRIVE THREE AND A HALF HOURS TO SEE A SPECIALIST RIGHT BECAUSE THERE AREN'T ANY AROUND SO THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY EMPLOYS ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA ROUGHLY TEN PERCENT OF OUR WORKFORCE RIGHT NOW AND OUR STATE HAS THIS WELL DOCUMENTED SHORTAGE SO IF CAL CARE BECAME LAW A. B. FOURTEEN HUNDRED PASSED HOW DO YOU THINK IT WOULD IMPACT THE ABILITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN ALL FIVE MEDICAL PROVIDERS IT OCCURS TO ME THERE ARE SEVERAL PROBLEMS FOR ONE THIS IS THE HIGHEST COST OF LIVING STATE IN THE COUNTRY I TALKED TO A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE DOES MEDICAL RECRUITING FOR DOCTORS FOR HOSPITALS HE SAYS EVERY WINTER I GET CALLS FROM A DOCTOR IN MICHIGAN OR WISCONSIN AND THEY WANT TO MOVE TO SANTA MARIA CALIFORNIA TO BE A DOCTOR AND THEN THEY REALIZE THEY'RE GONNA GET PAID LESS THEY'RE GONNA PAY THREE TIMES AS MUCH FOR THEIR HOUSE AND WE CAN'T GET HIM TO COME HERE NOW WE HAVE A LOT OF GREAT DOCTORS NURSES AND MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS THAT ARE HERE AND WILLING TO HEAR THAT AND AT THAT POINT TO STAY AND THAT'S GREAT BUT WE WE NEED TO RECRUIT MORE THAN AND THEN INDUCE THEM TO COME HERE NOW IF THEY COME HERE AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE ASSURANCE THAT THE SERVICES THEY PROVIDE ARE GOING TO BE ADEQUATE ADEQUATELY REIMBURSED IF FOR ANY STATE SYSTEM THAT IS ESSENTIALLY CONTROLLING COSTS BY RATIONING CARE BECAUSE I THINK YOU HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD HAS SINGLE PAYER HEALTHCARE INCLUDING CANADA WHICH IS HELD UP AS THE GOLD STANDARD BY MANY PEOPLE ON SINGLE PAYER HEALTHCARE IN CANADA THE AVERAGE TIME I LOOK THIS UP THIS IS A FOR A FACT THE AVERAGE TIME BETWEEN DIAGNOSIS AND GETTING AN ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY BACK SURGERY KNEE REPLACEMENT HIP REPLACEMENT ETCETERA IT'S FORTY EIGHT WEEKS THAT'S QUITE A WHILE I MEAN THEY RATION CARE IN CANADA THAT'S WELL DOCUMENTED AND I THINK HEALTHCARE MIGHT LEAD TO A SITUATION WHERE CALIFORNIA IS DOING SIMILAR THINGS TO CONTAIN COSTS AND THAT STRIKES ME AS A TOUGH SELL TO ALL OF THE MEDICAL SCHOOL GRADUATES NURSES AND PEAS ALL THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS THAT WE NEED TO BRING INTO OUR STATE SO THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH SERVICE PROVIDERS HERE TO SERVE OUR POPULATION SO HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS THAT CONCERN WAS A LOT OF LESSONS WE CAN CERTAINLY LEARN AS I SAID I'M MY INTEREST IS NOT TO CREATE A SYSTEM LIKE AND LIKE LIKE ANY OTHER I DO HAVE A CHANCE IN OCTOBER TO VISIT ONTARIO AND QUEBEC AND AND MET WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM BOTH THEIR HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS I ALSO WENT TO RULE COMMUNITY ACTUALLY LIVED IN BACK IN THE SEVENTIES WITH FORTY TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW THEY OBSERVE RURAL COMMUNITIES IN CANADA WHICH OBVIOUSLY HAS A LOT OF RURAL COMMUNITIES OF THE NORTH OF THE -- OF THE POPULATION BASE -- AND LOOK I AGREE THAT WORKFORCE SHORTAGE IS A PROBLEM WITH TODAY'S SYSTEM -- AND AN EIGHTY FOUR HUNDRED DESIGNED TO REMOVE SOME OF THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES AND REALLOCATE RESOURCES TO AREAS WITH WITH THE MOST NEED AND SO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH WE PAY A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL CAN INFLUENCE THE REPLACE SHORTAGE FOR EXAMPLE WE TEND TO PAY MORE TO SPECIALIST AND PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS AND WE SEE SHORTAGES IN PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ESPECIALLY IN RURAL CURRENT SYSTEM WE SEE IN OTHERS BUDGET CUTBACKS CORPORATE GREED A LACK OF SUPPORT STAFF BURNOUT THE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE NURSING SHORTAGE AND ATTEMPT TO MINIMIZE THE BECAUSE HOSPITALS ARE WILLING TO I'M GOING TO HIRE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND AND I GIVE YOU A PERFECT EXAMPLE LAST OF LAST YEAR -- ACTUALLY IN TWENTY TWENTY IN THE IN IN MAY OR JUNE TWENTY TWENTY RIGHT ON THE PENTAMETER ME THAT WAS HITTING US ALL HARD HOSPITAL CORPORATION AMERICA CLOSE THE WOMEN'S HEALTH CENTER IN EAST SAN JOSE THAT'S THE MATERNITY WARD NEONATAL PRENATAL THEY SHUT DOWN THE SAN JOSE THAT'S UNDER OUR CURRENT SYSTEM OF ALLOWING THOSE THAT ARE LOOKING FOR PROFIT THIS DICTATE WHO AND HOW IT'S GOING TO GET SERVED AND SO BY THE THE COUPLE THINGS ONE IS BY ELIMINATING ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLEXITY BE ALLOWED DOCTORS AND NURSES SPEND LESS TIME ON BILLING AND CODING MORE TIME TO DO WHAT THEY LOVE BEST WAS CARING FOR PATIENTS THEY CAN ALSO ALLOW DOCTORS TO HAVE MORE PATIENCE -- YOU KNOW THAT THEY CAN POTENTIALLY SEE RATHER THAN HAVING TO DEAL HOP THAT DATE WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES -- EIGHTY FOUR TWO HUNDRED DOES HAVE PROVISIONS TO INCREASE PAYMENT RATES IN AREAS THAT ARE PROVIDER SHORTAGES INCLUDING RURAL AND MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS SECTION ONE ZERO ZERO SIX FOUR FOUR PERMITS THE BOARD TO INCREASE PAYMENT RATES TO IMPROVE THE ABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES SESSION ONE ZERO ZERO SIX FOUR SEVEN ALLOWS A SPECIAL PROJECTS BUDGET TO BE USED INCREASED PAYMENT RATES TO IMPROVE THE AVAILABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND RURAL OR MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE'RE NOT TALKING A MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CHARACTER SYSTEM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REIMBURSING FOR THE COST OF CARE THE DOCTORS HOSPITALS NURSES ARE ACTUALLY PROVIDING A AND THE OTHER THING IN TERMS OF BRINGING WORK FORCE IS IS A LONG DEBT

FOURTEEN HUNDRED THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER MARK AND MUCH APPRECIATED AND THEN MR RODRIGUEZ TWENTY ALONG WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU INTRODUCED FIFTY FIFTY FOURTEEN HUNDRED ALMOST A YEAR AGO IN THE TIME SINCE THEN I CHECK YOUR TURKEY WORD THE YOU'VE CONSULTED WITH HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE AND COUNTRY AND OTHER COUNTRIES SHORTLY AFTER YOU AND INTRODUCED THIS LEGISLATION I APPROACHED YOU PERSONALLY WITH QUESTIONS OUT OF CONCERN FOR MY CONSTITUENTS ALL CALIFORNIANS AND INDEED THE COUNTRY I NEVER GOT AN ANSWER TO ONE OF THEM SO I SUPPOSE I'M GETTING AN ANSWER OF SORTS WHAT YOU ARE SAYING TO THIS COMMITTEE IS THAT AFTER ALL THE CONSUL THE PATIENTS HUNDREDS OF QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS FROM YOUR YOUR COLLEAGUES AND STAKEHOLDERS OVER THE LAST ELEVEN MONTHS YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT THE PERFECT BILL TO REPLACE HEALTH CARE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA YOU'RE TELLING US THE YOU THINK ANY SINGLE QUESTION OR CONCERN WAS WORTHY OF ANY CHANGE TO YOUR LEGISLATION BEFORE ASKING FOR A VOTE IN THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE NOT ONE NOT ONE OF MINE NOT ONE OF SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES I WHOLEHEARTEDLY SHARE YOUR CONCERN ABOUT GETTING REAL HEALTH CARE COVERAGE TO EVERY RESIDENT IN THE STATE AND WHEN I SAY FOR ALL THAT MEANS THE UNDERINSURED HAVE NO HEALTH INSURANCE YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR YESTERDAY A PROPOSED A BUDGET THAT WILL COVER EVERY CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF AGE OR STATUS I WOULD GUESS AND YOU LIKELY AGREE WITH THAT WE ASPIRE TO MORE BUT THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE PLACE FOR US TO START IMPROVE OURSELVES CAPABLE IF YOU HAVE PRESENTED A BILL THAT WOULD HAVE ASSURED HEALTH CARE HEALTH INSURANCE FOR ALL THOSE WHO ARE AN IN UNDERINSURED I HAVE CELEBRATED THE EFFORT AND GLADLY OFFERED MY SUPPORT JUST LIKE I HAVE EVERY BILL TO EXPAND HEALTH CARE COVERAGE DURING MY TIME IN THE ASSEMBLY WELL I AGREE WHO SHOULD PROVIDE PUBLIC COVERAGE FOR ALL SOME DAY I CANNOT AGREE WITH THAT OUR FIRST STEPS WE SHOULD BE TAKING IT AWAY FROM THOSE WHO HAVE AMPLE COVERAGE I SINCERELY BELIEVE THAT OPERATING THE WAY YOU ARE YOU'RE PUTTING THOSE WHO DESPERATELY NEED ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AT SIGNIFICANT RISK OF LOSING OUT AGAIN AND I PASSIONATELY REJECT THE ARGUMENT THAT IF IF ONE DOESN'T BELIEVE THIS IS THE WAY TO REFORM OUR BROKEN HEALTH INSURANCE AND HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS DO YOU SUPPORT THE STATUS QUO FOR THOSE WHO MAKE THAT INTELLECTUALLY LAZY ARGUMENT YOU'RE NOT HELPING THOSE OF US WHO ARE FIGHTING TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM AND OUR DEMOCRACY MISTER CARL I WILL GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THE WAY YOU ARE WORKING ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE AGAINST MY BETTER JUDGEMENT I WILL CAST A RELUCTANT I WROTE FOR YOU TODAY BUT MR CARL I WILL VOTE NO ON THIS ON THE FLOOR YOU CANNOT TELL ME THAT A PRODUCT THAT WILL BE COMPLETELY CHANGE THE HEALTH SYSTEM FOR FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS WAS PERFECT THE DAY IT WAS INTRODUCED I'M NOT WILLING TO TAKE A FLYER AND CAST MY LOT WITH PLATITUDES GIVING SOMEONE ELSE DIRECTION DO FIGURE IT ALL OUT I'M ALSO NOT VOTE FOR A BILL THAT DOES NOT DEPEND ON UPON A FUNDING MECHANISM FOR ENACTMENT THAT WOULD BE A LIE TO WORK INSTANCE CONSTITUENTS WHO BELIEVE YOU'RE FULFILLING A PROMISE OF HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF SPENDING ON THEIR FAMILIES VERY LIVES I NEED TO KNOW HOW THE STATE BUREAUCRACY THAT HAS RESISTED MY EFFORTS TO EXPAND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE THROUGH SUCH PROVEN METHODS THIS TELEHEALTH IS SOMETHING GOING TO APPROVE ALL THE PROCEDURES CURRENTLY BEING REJECTED BY PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES THE PROMISE ADVOCATES SAY THAT YOU HAVE MAY I NEED TO KNOW HOW YOUR BILL WILL GUARANTEE GREATER ACCESS TO HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND HEALTH FACILITIES IN SMALLER CITIES IMPORTANT RURAL COMMUNITIES LIKE THOSE IN MY DISTRICT THIS IS ANOTHER PROMISES SUPPORTERS CONTEND YOU HAVE MADE WE BOTH KNOW THAT HEALTH COVERAGE IS NO GUARANTEE OF HEALTHAXIS SHOULD WE HAVE A PUBLIC SYSTEM FOR PROVIDING HEALTH CARE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SUNDAY ABSOLUTELY BUT I BELIEVE IT SHOULD COME AFTER WE HAVE DEVELOPED THE PLANS NOT GIVEN OPEN INTO FORTY AND LITTLE DIRECTION TO IT AS YET ON APPOINTED BOARD THE NATION'S WATCHING THIS EXPERIMENT COLLEAGUES WE WE CAN SHOW THEM THE WAY BY BUILDING ON THE SYSTEM WHERE EVERYONE IS GUARANTEED SUFFICIENT COVERAGE AND THEN ARE ENCOURAGED TO LEAVE EVER GROWING COST FOR INSUFFICIENT HEALTH CARE BEHIND US YOU KNOW WE HAVE A COUPLE WEEKS AND I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR YOU DIRECTLY MISTER KALRA I REGARDING WORKFORCE IN THE LANGUAGES STATES THE BOARD SHALL ADOPT REGULATIONS IN REGARDS TO MAINTAINING OPTIMAL WORKFORCE THE HEALTH CARE FACILITIES NECESSARY TO DELIVER QUALITY EQUITABLE HEALTH CARE HOWEVER THAT'S NOT A PLAN IT'S THE BOARD WILL WORRY ABOUT WORKFORCE PROBLEMS MY CONSTITUENTS ALREADY FACE WORKFORCE SHORTAGES IN ON THIS AND MANY OTHER CONCERNS I KEEP GETTING TOLD I WILL SAVE DON'T FIX THAT LATER WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT LATER WILL GET BETTER CAN YOU TELL ME HOW THIS BILL WILL IMPROVE ACCESS TO MY SMALL TOWN AND RURAL CONSTITUENCIES I DON'T EXPECT AN ANSWER NOW I EXPECT BEFORE WE GO TO THE FLOOR THE LANGUAGE ALSO INCLUDES A SPECIAL PROJECTS FUND FOR THE BOARD TO USE IN AREAS WITH ACCESS PROBLEMS BUT AGAIN THERE'S NO PLAN AS YOU KNOW MISTER KALRA INCREASING COVERAGE DOES NOT INCREASE ACCESS HUNDRED SURE PATIENTS HAVE TIMELY AND EQUITABLE ACCESS TO HEALTH SERVICES SPECIFICALLY IN RURAL AND URBAN UNDERSERVED AREAS HELLO DISC DECREASED A DISPARITIES IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM -- YOU CAN EXPECT CAN YOU EXPLAIN YOUR PLAN FOR SWITCHING RESOURCES CURRENTLY COMMITTED TO FUNDING THE PRIVATE SYSTEM INTO A NEW PUBLICLY RUN SYSTEM OR ACL EVANS TAX INCREASES MEANT TO REPLACE OR SUPPLEMENT WHAT EMPLOYERS EMPLOYEES CAN NOW CONTRIBUTE TO HEALTH CARE PLANS AND LASTLY NEARLY SIX MILLION CALIFORNIANS ARE ROLLED AND PRIVATE HEALTH COVERAGE REGULATED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND ROLLING THEM INTO HEALTHCARE COULD REQUIRE A CHANGE IN FEDERAL REGULATORY LAW AND WOULD LIKELY REQUIRE CHANGES TO THE STATE CONSTITUTION WHICH IN ADDITION TO PASSING TAX INCREASES COULD FOR SINGLE PAYER BACKERS TO OBTAIN VOTER APPROVAL THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT A C. ELEVEN WILL MAKE IT THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE AND IF IT DOES THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THE VOTERS WILL VOTE FOR IT IF THE ACA DOESN'T PASS MISTER KALRA WHAT HAPPENS WHAT HAPPENS I DON'T WANT TO BE SITTING HERE TO MAKING PROMISES A RECAP OF FILL THEM WE DO THAT A LOT HERE AND SO THAT'S ONE OF MY BIGGEST CONCERNS IT'S EASY AS WE SAY IN MY OFFICE IT'S EASY FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE BROUGHT THREE TO BUY A NEW CAR IF THERE'S NO DISCUSSION WHERE THE MONEY IS COMING FROM AND I THINK THE HEALTH OF FORTY MILLION PEOPLE IS JUST A BIT MORE IMPORTANT AND COMPLICATED TO FIND THE FAMILY CAR I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU THANK YOU MISTER RODRIGUEZ THANK RESEARCHER THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA YOU KNOW WHAT -- IF YOU'VE BEEN A VERY STRONG SUPPORTER AND CHAMPION FOR THIS MEASURE -- BUT I TO SHARE A LOT OF CONCERNS I THINK TOOK THE WORDS OUT OF MY MOUTH WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT CONCERNS ALWAYS YOU BIGGEST THING OF RETIREES WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM -- WHAT THEY'VE BEEN RECEIVING AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM THE TRANSITION TO THIS NEW -- CALIFORNIA CARE PROGRAM WE CANNOT I KNOW WE'RE WE TALKED ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION THE TAXES WHAT HAPPENS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IF WE HAVE A NEW ADMINISTRATION AND WE WE GET THE THE WAIVERS RIGHT AND WE'RE INTO THIS IN A NEW ADMINISTRATION COMES UP AND THEY REVOKING CANDOR REVOKE THEM -- WE HAVE BUDGET SHORTFALLS YOU KNOW HOW THINGS WE GO GOOD YET SOME YEARS OR SOME YEARS AGO ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN OUR BUDGET TAKES IT A DUMP AND AND HOW DOES THAT AFFECT THE FINANCING FOR TO INCREASING TAXES ONCE AGAIN NOT EVERYBODY ACROSS THE BOARD BECAUSE REALLY IT ISN'T FREE IMAGE SOMEHOW HAS TO GET PAID FOR AND A FORTUNE IT'S GOING TO BE SPREAD AMONGST DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS AND PEOPLE -- I CAN GO ON AND ON I THINK I READ THE THE NOTICES AS WELL SIXTY ONE PAGES AND IT LEAVES ME A LOT MORE QUESTIONS I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THEM BECAUSE I TOOK UP TODAY TO READ THEM AND I'M STILL NOT THERE ARE A HUNDRED PERCENT BUT ALL I COULD SAY IS THAT HOPEFULLY YOU WORK ON ALL THESE ISSUES AND CONCERNS THAT OUR PAPER BRING IN FORT IF I LOOK TO SUPPORT IT TODAY I WOULD HOPE THAT WE HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING WHEN IT GETS TO THE FOR THAT YOU COULD ADDRESS OUR ISSUES OUT -- AND I GET RESERVE MY RIGHT TO TO VOTE FOR IT THERE IF IT GETS TO THAT POINT -- BUT ONCE AGAIN I WANT TO TAKE TOO MUCH TIME OF WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR A LONG TIME NOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FOR A COUPLE YEARS IT IS A NEW IT'S IN EVERYBODY'S RADAR BUT ONCE AGAIN ASSEMBLY MEMBER PLEASE LOOK AT THESE CONCERNS AND ISSUES PEOPLE ROB FORD AND THE THINGS IN THE NOW THIS IS A ONCE AGAIN IF I DO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY I'M GOING TO RESERVE MY RIGHT NOT TO SUPPORT ON THE FLOOR IF I DON'T GET A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE ROLLOUT TAKES EFFECT THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS WALDRON THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN ANNOYING CROSSED OUT SEVERAL MY QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED SO I'LL TRY NOT TO REPEAT WHAT'S BEEN SAID IN LIGHT OF SITTING HERE FOR SEVEN HOURS ALREADY WOULD ALLOW THE WITNESS IN OPPOSITION TO COME FORWARD TO ANSWER QUESTIONS MISTER YOUNG LIVES OUT THERE YEAH YOUR ARMS AND WHILE HIS COMING UP -- OF THOSE PURPOSES I WANTED TO ASK HIM ABOUT HE HAD TOUCHED ON OF ONE OF THE ISSUES WITH THE BOARD THAT WOULD BE SET UP THAT THIS THIS BOARD WOULD BE -- PROVIDING BUDGETS FOR HOSPITALS AND OTHERS AT ACTING AS RATE SETTING BECAUSE THE BOARD WILL NOW DECIDE WHAT OPERATING COSTS WILL BE INSTEAD OF WHAT THEY ACTUALLY ARE AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD COME ALIVE RATE YOU KNOW WILLIS BOARD LOOK AT PROVIDER RATES WILL THEY BE SENDING HOSPITAL RATES -- WILL IMPROVE PRICE CEILINGS -- YEAH HOW DO YOU FORESEE THIS WORKING THERE ANY -- JOB CREATORS HOWEVER -- IF YOU COULD JUST REPEAT A LITTLE BIT OF A QUOTE REAL QUICK SERVICE COMING UP SORRY THIS WASN'T SUING SO THE BOARD ON THAT THAT WILL BE SET UP HOSPITALS AND OTHERS IS AXES RIGHT GREAT SITTING BASICALLY BECAUSE THE BOARD WILL NOW HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT THE OPERATING COSTS WOULD BE INSTEAD OF WHAT THE REALITY IS WHAT'S THE ACTUAL COST VERSUS WHAT THEY WOULD SAID WILL LEAD TO JUSTIN PROVIDER RATES HOSPITAL RATES ACCEPTABLE WITH THE PRICING ON YEAH IT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND I CAN TELL YOU RATE SETTING IS SOMETHING THAT IS DISCONCERTING BEEN THAT THE FREE MARKET SHOULD SET WHAT THE RATES ARE BECAUSE THAT BECOMES PATIENT CENTRIC IN SO IF YOU DO HAVE A PATIENT AT THE POINT OF CARE WHO HAS THE ABILITY TO MISTER OR DOCTOR WHICH POINT EARLIER ABOUT -- TRANSPARENCY IN PRICING IN PATIENTS KNOWING WHAT THEY'RE GETTING INTO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING RATE SETTINGS NOT NECESSARILY THE ANSWER THOUGH AND THE REASON WHY IS IT IT BIFURCATES DOESN'T NECESSARILY REIMBURSE FOR WORK THAT IS DONE AND I THINK IMPORTANTLY IF DOESN'T REIMBURSE FOR QUALITY CARE AS OPPOSED TO -- MAYBE QUANTITY OF CARE OR VOLUME OF CARE BE GOING TO REQUEST OKAY QUESTION IS ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE ALL AGREE THE STATUS QUO IS NOT WORKING AND AND THIS WOULD BE FOR THE AUTHOR OR HIS SUPPORTER -- MEDICO SYSTEM IS BROKEN THERE'S TOO MUCH BUREAUCRACY WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PROVIDERS WE CAN ALL AGREE THERE'S A WORKFORCE SHORTAGE OF PROVIDERS MEDICO ACCESS TO CARE IS GROWING AND IS AN EVER PRESENT PROBLEM WHY NOT WORK ON STREAMLINING IMPROVING AND FIXING MEDICO SO THAT MORE PEOPLE CAN ACCESS IT RATHER THAN KIND OF SCRAPPING THE WHOLE SYSTEM STARTING OVER A BIG ISSUE WITH MEDI CAL AS THE FACULTY MEMBERS OF RATES ARE TOO LOW AND YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PROVIDERS ARE GOING TO TAKE THEM ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND SO WE CAN AND I'VE ALWAYS SUPPORTED EVERY EFFORT WHENEVER YOU TRY TO INCREASE MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT REYES BECAUSE AGAIN WITHIN THE CURRENT SYSTEM WE HAVE THAT'S THE BEST WAY OF RECREATING IN ACCESS BUT THEN THE DAY IS NOT ENOUGH -- AND THE END BECAUSE MEDI CAL IS ULTIMATELY COMPETING WITH THE PRIVATE PAY SYSTEM THAT IS NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO CATCH CATCH UP AND SO RATHER THAN HAVING A MAN HAVING A CASTE SYSTEM WITHIN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WE HAVE FOLKS THAT ARE ON MEDICARE L. OR A CA BRONZE LEVEL GAME COVER CALIFORNIA BRONZE LEVEL OR SOME KIND OF LIKE PACKAGE OF HEALTH CARE INSTEAD YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY INCREASE REIMBURSEMENT RATES IF YOU HAVE EVERYONE IN ONE SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM AND THEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS OF PHARMACEUTICALS ON HEALTHCARE DELIVERY -- AND YOU'RE ABLE TO THEN PAY PROVIDERS MORE ESPECIALLY PEDIATRICIANS FAMILY DOCTORS ARE NOT GETTING COMPENSATED FRANKLY ENOUGH FOR THE CRITICAL SERVICES PARTICULARLY INSURANCE PREVENTATIVE CARE OTHER THEY PROVIDE AND THAT'S WHY IN SO MANY RURAL COMMUNITIES AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES IT'S HARD TO FIND DOCTORS THAT WILL TAKE A MINUTE CAL AND THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT PAYING THEM ENOUGH AND SO INSTEAD OF HAVING A OF OF A SECONDARY LEVEL OF OF CARE -- AND AGAIN WHEN I SAY THAT I DON'T NEED THE DOCTORS GETTING A SECONDARY LEVEL CARE I MEAN THAT THERE'S ONLY JUST SO SO MANY PATIENTS THAT SOME OF THE TAKES MEDICAL CONTENT G. C. AND SO THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T HAVE NO DOCTORS TAKING -- EDIT CAL PATIENTS ON TOP OF THAT YOU HAVE MORE PEOPLE GOING TO SPECIALTIES AND COMING SPECIALIST BECAUSE THEY CAN MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY WE HAVE LESS OF A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WE HAVE MORE OF THE DISEASE MANAGEMENT AND CATASTROPHIC RESPONSE SYSTEM WHERE WE GET WHERE FOLKS ARE KIND OF DESTROYING ALONG BUT THE BUT THE THE -- ALL LEVEL OF CARE WHERE YOU HAVE DOCTORS THAT USED TO BE ABLE TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU FOR TWENTY MINUTES NOW LOOKING AS IF YOU WERE TWO MINUTES BECAUSE THEY'RE DEALING WITH ALL THE BUREAUCRACY AND PAPERWORK OF INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THEN ULTIMATELY SOMETHING CATASTROPHIC HAPPENS AND THE SPECIALIST COMES AND MAKES A BOATLOAD OF MONEY AND PATCHES YOU UP SEND YOU BACK OUT WITHOUT EVER DEALING WITH THE UNDERLYING ISSUES WE NEED A FOOT THAT IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND THIS TYPE OF SYSTEM HAS THE ABILITY TO DO THAT BY FOCUSING WHERE THE RESOURCES NEED TO GO IN A WAY THAT THEY CAN FOCUS ON HEALTH OUTCOMES NOT JUST WHETHER OF BILLS PAID OR NOT SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT PROVIDERS WOULD BE PAID MORE UNDER THIS NEW SYSTEM YEAH THIS IS NOT ABOUT PAYING PEOPLE BETTER CALORIES ABSOLUTELY NOT OKAY SO SPECIALIST WILL STILL BE PAID MORE TO RECURSOS RIGID PROCEDURES WOULD BE ALL INDIVIDUAL OVER THE PROVIDERS WILL BE PAID IT YOU KNOW ACCORDING TO THE SERVICE THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING WITHOUT HAVING FOR EXAMPLE SITUATIONS NOW WE'RE IN THE SAME HOSPITAL FOR THE SAME PROCEDURE YOU CAN HAVE A VARIANCE IN OF OF TEN X. TEN TIMES FOR SOME OF MY GET CHARGE SIX HUNDRED SIX HUNDRED SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS OR SOMETHING SOMEONE ELSE THE SAME HOSPITAL BE CHARGED SIX OR SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND IT'S JUST A NONSENSICAL WAY OF HAVING HEALTHCARE DELIVERY OF IT IN OUR STATE AND SO WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO RIGHT SIZE IT TOOK UNTIL AT LEAST HAVE SOME SENSE OF ORDER WHERE THE RESOURCES ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS YOU'RE NOT HAVING MASSIVE PROFITS TAKEN OFF THE TOP OF THAT CREATE ANY ANY ANY CALL SYSTEM AND ALSO INCENTIVIZE SPECIALIST OVER -- YOUR FAMILY PRACTITIONERS AS WELL SO I THINK WE COULD GO A LONG WAY AND SAVE MONEY TOO WE WOULD FINALLY AS THIS LEGISLATURE INCREASE MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT RATES THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT DOING FOR A LONG LONG TIME BUT I JUST HAVE SOME COMMENTS FOR THE RECORD THANK YOU -- FOR THAT SO WE STUDIED SINGLE PAYER FOR MANY YEARS NOW WE'VE HAD A FEW BILLS COME FORWARD WE YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF THE ARGUMENTS WE'VE SEEN EVEN HAD A SELECT COMMITTEE ON HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND UNIVERSAL COVERAGE THAT SPENT MONTHS AND MONTHS GOING THROUGH ITS WAS FABULOUS THANK YOU DOCTOR WILL DOUBLE AS A I OPENING AND I WISH WE COULD DO THAT AGAIN -- THE FAX HOWEVER MUCH OF A NETFLIX REYES IS ONLY THIRTY FIVE HOURS SO THE FAX HOWEVER NEVER DISAPPEAR EVEN IF SOME ATTEMPT TO IGNORE THEM THE COST IS IMPOSSIBLE TO IGNORE AND THAT YOU KNOW YOU GO THROUGH AND I WILL YOU KNOW HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS TENNESSEE'S TEN CARE KENTUCKY CARE VERMONT ALL FAILED SYSTEMS WITH HUGE PAYROLL TAX OPTIONS THAT IT EVENTUALLY SHOT DOWN THOSE SYSTEMS OR WEAKENED THEM OR CHANGE THEM INTO AMORPHOUS SYSTEMS L. A. O. COSTA SIMMONS BLOW BY ANYTHING THE STATE HAS TRIED BEFORE THE SAME GOVERNMENT AS WAS MENTIONED THAT BUNGLED EDT DMV ETCETERA WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG SO YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO FOCUS ON THE POLICY ONLY AND NOT THE AMOUNT OF COST SO MOTHER EARTH MY COMMENTS ARE GOING TO IGNORE COSTS AND TALK ABOUT THE ACTUAL DOCUMENTED RESULTS OF THE SINGLE PAYER TYPE OF CARE JUST FROM ACTUAL THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN HISTORY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SEPARATE THE POSITIVE CONCEPT OF GOVERNMENT PROVIDED HEALTHCARE FOR ALL BECAUSE COST CONTAINMENT AS MAIN ROADBLOCK BUT IN ORDER FOR ME TO PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY'RE GETTING A FREE NOTHING IS FREE AND IT'LL ACTUALLY INCREASE MORE PEOPLE COMING INTO THE SYSTEM WHICH WILL CREATE THAT ISSUE OF NOT BEING ENOUGH -- NOT NOT BEING ENOUGH CARE FOR THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE COMING IN AND THAT'S WHERE WE GET TO THE RATE SETTING BY YOU KNOW FORCING BUDGETS THAT ARE NOT REALISTIC SO LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE RAMIFICATIONS BRING IN THE SOUND DIFFERENT THAN OUR SELECT COMMITTEES THAT WE ARE SPENT MONTHS ON WE DISSECTED THE ISSUE AND IS SIMILAR VERSION UNIVERSAL CARE FROM EVERY ANGLE INCLUDING HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS GLOBALLY WHAT WE FOUND THROUGH EXPERT AFTER EXPERT TESTIMONY IS THAT EVERYWHERE SINGLE PAYER WAS INSTITUTED THE VALUE OF CARE DECLINES IN THE COST GOES UP THE GOAL I GET IT IS TO INCREASE ACCESS HAVE QUALITY CARE AND HAVE A COSTS LESS VOTE EVERY SYSTEM WE SAW IT WITH DID NOT PAN OUT THAT WAY ANY SYSTEM THAT REMOTELY WORK INCLUDED SOME FORM OF A PRIVATE PLAN ALTERNATIVE OUR HEARING CALIFORNIAN PLAYERS SPONSORED INSURANCE IS STILL THE BIGGEST SOURCE OF COVERAGE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS ABOUT HALF OF ALL CALIFORNIANS WOULD COVERAGE ARE ON EMPLOYER SPONSORED AND TOTAL UNDER JUST UNDER TWENTY MILLION ABOUT EIGHTEEN POINT NINE MILLION CALIFORNIANS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THIS WAS THE NUMBER I GOT IN TWENTY FIFTEEN FOR PRIVATE INSURANCE LET'S TALK ABOUT MEDICARE IF AND IF THE AFTER WE ACTUALLY GET A FEDERAL WAIVER IN CALIFORNIA AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE MEDICARE COVERED SIX POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE ABOUT EIGHTY FOUR PERCENT OF SEWER SIXTY FIVE PLUS SEVENTEEN PERCENT UNDER SIXTY FIVE DISABLED IN CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE MEDIC CAL OUR MEDICAID SYSTEM COVERS ABOUT THIRTEEN MILLION WITH NINETEEN PERCENT IN FEE FOR SERVICE SO THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO LOSE THAT COVERAGE OVERNIGHT TO MOVE INTO THIS NEW SYSTEM IT'S A VERY BIG ENDEAVOR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE MEDI CAL BENEFITS INCLUDE MANDATORY AND OPTIONAL CARE HOW LIST PLAN PROCEEDS TO COVER ALL OF THESE OPTIONAL BENEFITS FOR EVERYONE WHETHER THEY'RE OVER OR UNDER THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL -- DENTAL COVERAGE DENTAL COVERAGE IS ALREADY OVERLOOKED WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER OPTION I WON'T EVEN TALK ABOUT THE MANDATORY BENEFITS OF THE OPTIONAL BENEFITS PRESCRIPTION DRUGS CLINIC SERVICES DENTAL IS A SAID DENTURES PHYSICAL THERAPY REHAB FOR STATIC SERVICES EYEGLASSES PRIMARY CARE CASE MANAGEMENT INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES FOR THEM THE MENTALLY ILL INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC CARE FOR INDIVIDUALS UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE HOME HEALTH CARE OTHER SERVICES PROVIDED UNDER HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED WAIVERS PERSONAL CARE SERVICE HOSPICE SERVICE HOME HEALTH SERVICE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED ATTENDANCE SERVICE SUPPORT THAT'S A LOT A LOT THAT'S -- NEED HAS TO GO INTO THIS CANADA SAYS LET'S TALK ABOUT CANADA HI RELATIVES IN CANADA I CAN SPEAK TO ON A PERSONAL LEVEL CANADA'S SYSTEM INCLUDES GOVERNMENT SAID PAYMENTS AND CANADIAN PHYSICIANS AND NURSES ARE PAID LESS THAN HERE IN AMERICA LEADING TO EVEN LESS PROVIDERS AND NURSES INTERESTED IN WORKING IN CALIFORNIA IF THIS TYPE OF SYSTEM GO FORWARD IN THE COMMITTEE WE -- THE SUBCOMMITTEE WE FOUND THAT ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WORK AND HEALTH INSURANCE CLAIMS IN OUR PRIVATE AND AND ALSO IN MEDICAL INSURANCE ALL GOING TO LOSE THEIR JOBS AND THE MOSTLY WOMEN THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE I MEAN WHAT HAVE THE SOULS WILL GOING TO LOSE THEIR JOBS CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA THE MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT RATE IS SO LOW THAT IN MANY CASES THE COST FOR THE DOCTOR TO PROVIDE THE CARE IS HIGHER THAN THE REIMBURSEMENT WE'VE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR YEARS FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THIS AREA SINCE THIS IS A STATE RUN PROPOSAL PROVIDERS WILL LEAVE CALIFORNIA PRACTICING THOUGH THE STATE'S ALONG WITH RATIONAL CITIZENS HOLDING TIGHT TO THE WALLETS WAIT TIMES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LENGTHENED IN CANADA WAS MENTIONED SOME NOT GONNA GO INTO AS MUCH DEPTH OF THE WATER WE HAD THE STUDY THE STUDIES DONE ANNUALLY TITLED WAITING YOUR TURN BY THE FRASER INSTITUTE THE STUDY THE WAIT LIST TIMES OVER TWO DECADES WITH TWELVE SPECIALTIES AND TEN PROVINCES I FIND THAT WEIGHTS ARE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT LONGER AFTER THEY PUT IN THE THE NEW TYPE OF COVERAGE THAT THEY HAVE IN CANADA LONGER THAN IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE WHEN IT WAS JUST NINE POINT THREE WEEKS WE HEARD GETTING ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON FORTY EIGHT PLUS WEEKS THE WAITING MONTH TO GET CARE THE WAITING OVER A MONTH FOR ALMOST TWO MONTHS JUST TO GET A DIAGNOSTIC TEST WHICH IS NOT EVEN CARE SO -- THE VALUE OF CARE IS REDUCED ALL ULTIMATELY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THIS PROPOSAL HOPES TO ACHIEVE WHAT WE ALL WANT SO I'M JUST YOU KNOW ON A PERSONAL LEVEL OF UNCLE KEITH LOSING IN CANADA EIGHTY PLUS YEARS OLD TWO YEARS AGO STEP OF THE CURRENT BROKE SOME BONES IN HIS LOWER LEG WENT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM THEY SAW HIM THEY SENT HIM HOME AND THAT HE NEVER GOT WE HAVE NEVER GOT REALLY ANY CARE TO SPEAK OF AND HE'S BEDRIDDEN WHEN HE WAS ON THE GOLF COURSE BEFORE THIS INCIDENT SO I AM NO ONE WANTS THAT NO ONE SUPPORTS THE STATUS QUO YOU KNOW NINETY THREE PERCENT OF PEOPLE ARE COVERED NOW THE COVERAGE DOESN'T EQUAL CARE WE CAN FOCUS ON THOSE THINGS -- AND I HAVE A WHOLE LIST OF IDEAS SO I'M NOT JUST VOTING NO I ACTUALLY DO HAVE IDEAS AND ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THEM ABOUT STREAMLINING THE BURDENSOME SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE NOW INCREASED AND MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT RATES TO INCENTIVIZE MORE PROVIDERS WE NEED ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE SYSTEM WE NEEDED OUTCOME BASED WE NEED VALID VALUE BASED CARE WE NEED TO BRING MORE TECHNOLOGY THAT ACTUALLY WORKS INTO THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM SO WE HAVE MORE DATA AND MAKE IT MORE PERSONALIZED MAKES MORE STREAMLINED WE NEED TO ALLOW TO BURKE TO ANALYZE FIVE TO TEN YEARS OR TWENTY YEARS OR LIFETIME WHICH IS WHAT PRIVATE PLANS DO BECAUSE I MET WITH THE TO BERMAN ELSE THIS ANALYSTS AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY DO AND HOW THEY DO IT WE CAN GET A BETTER IDEA COULD WORK ON KEEPING OUR COSTS LOWER IF WE ARE MORE EFFICIENT AND IT WE NEED MORE PRETENCE PARENTS SEEING ANOTHER DOCTOR WOULD SAID ONE OF THE TO COST GOING IN THE BUREAUCRACY IS TOO BIG STARTING WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES BECAUSE TRY TO GET ANY INFORMATION -- THERE WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING SO YOU KNOW NO ONE SUPPORTS THE STATUS QUO WE CAN DO SOME THINGS AND I COULD GO ON AND ON BUT I THINK A SEVEN OF FIFTY SEVEN AND A HALF HOURS THANK YOU THANK YOU -- THIS BIRTH TERIA I DON'T KNOW IF I'M SHAKING BECAUSE I'M FREEZING ARE IF -- GLEE THIS BILL BRINGS UP A LOT OF FEELINGS FOR ME AND IF YOU HAVE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE SINCE YOU I'VE BEEN HERE SINCE WE STARTED THIS CONVERSATION YOU'VE HEARD SOME OF THIS FOR ME BEFORE I APOLOGIZE IF YOU HAVEN'T THE STATE'S NEW FREEDOM -- I HAD MY FIRST MISCARRIAGE WHEN I WAS SIX MONTHS PREGNANT AND I ONLY BRING THAT UP BECAUSE BACK IN THOSE DAYS THAT MEANT I COULDN'T GET HEALTH INSURANCE SO I KNOW FIRST HAND WHAT IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU ARE PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY DEVASTATED TO HAVE THAT EXTRA FIERER LAID ON TOP OF THE ON BUT LIKE MOST IN THIS ROOM I'VE TRIED TO USE THOSE HARD OUR LIFE EXPERIENCES TO MAKE ME A BETTER LEGISLATOR THAT BEING SAID SO I BELIEVE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE IS VITAL AND AFTER LISTENING TODAY I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S ANYONE IN THIS ROOM OR IN THIS LEGISLATOR LET'S LET'S SHOW THE DISAGREES THE QUESTION BEFORE US WITH AB FOURTEEN HUNDRED IS WHAT WILL THAT LOOK LIKE NOT JUST POLITICALLY BUT POLICY WISE THANK YOU WHAT CAN WE AFFORD TO DO AND WHAT SHOULD WE DO MORALLY DEMAND OF OURSELVES SO I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS I WILL MAKE THEM CLICK I HAVE CROSSED OFF LIKE OTHERS I HAVE CROSSED ON SOME OF MY QUESTIONS THAT I AM HAVE BEEN ANSWERED I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY A FEW THINGS SO IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AND PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG THAT THE UNIVERSE I'M UNINSURED CALIFORNIANS THAT AB FOURTEEN HUNDRED SEEKS TO ADDRESS IS ROUGHLY THREE POINT TWO MILLION AND THE GOVERNOR'S RECENT BUDGET PROPOSAL ANNOUNCED ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR ALL STATE RESIDENTS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS BETWEEN THAT AND THE CHAIR'S OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE FOR THE OF WHICH I HAVE BEEN A CO AUTHOR IT SEEMS LIKE JUST THIS WEEK CALIFORNIA HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES TO ACHIEVE YOUR STATED GOALS BUT THE AND THOSE ARE NOW GOALS AS OPPOSED TO SOME HOPE AND UNDERDEVELOPED COSTS SO THAT RIGHT NOW UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND COST CONTAINMENT WITHOUT RAISING TAXES IS ON THE TABLE IS THAT CORRECT BOTH OF DECEMBER THIS IS LIKE I SAID EARLIER IN MY COMMENTS I DO SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND AND THE WORK OF DR ROBERT AND SO MANY OTHERS HERE THE IN EXPANDING ACCESS BUT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IS NOT THE SAME AS UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE AND THAT'S THE DISTINCTION IS THAT MANY PEOPLE THAT HAVE INSURANCE DEDUCTIBLES OF BECAUSE OTHER COSTS -- THEY ARE THE RATIONAL CARE I DON'T HAVE TO ACCESS OR GO BANKRUPT EVEN WHILE THEY HAVE INSURANCE -- AND SO THIS IS ABOUT ACTUALLY CREATE BRING COMPREHENSIVE CARE TO EVERY CALIFORNIANS -- SO DOES THIS OF THEIR WEALTH REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY LIVE -- AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE FALL SHORT OF SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU'RE PROPOSALS ON THE TABLE IN THE GOVERNOR'S NOW I'M SUGGESTING THAT NOW ACCESS AND UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IS ON THE TABLE RIGHT NOW AND WITHOUT ANY SORT OF TAX INCREASES IS THAT CORRECT MMHM RIGHT AND IN GREAT AND WILL BE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S WITH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WAS WITHIN A COUPLE YEARS I THINK THAT CREATING UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO AND THE ONLY REMAINING POPULATION DOCTOR ON THE FRONT IS BETTER THAN I DO WOULD BE THOSE THAT HAVE NOT SIGNED UP TO COVER CALIFORNIA THEY'RE ELIGIBLE THEN ALSO FOR MY CLARIFICATION HAS ANYTHING FROM THE HEALTH CARE TASK FORCE THAT HAS WAS HOW MANY THIRTY SEVEN HOURS THAT WE'RE GONNA WATCHING NETFLIX -- HAVE ANY OF THE SUGGESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM EITHER THAT OR FROM THE CHAIR BEEN TAKEN IN THIS BILL THAT IS IN FRONT OF US TODAY I CAN ASK OF MISCONDUCT IS ALSO ON THAT COMMISSION SHE'S A COMMISSIONER AS WELL SO I JUST OF THE HOUSE I DO KNOW THAT THERE WERE MORE AND MORE THAN ONE ASSAM HEARD OTHERS TO HAVE THE B. FOURTEEN HUNDRED AS PART OF THE CONVERSATION MORE SPECIFICALLY AS PART OF THE COMMISSION AND AND -- BUT IF IF -- THIS TIME SHE WANTS TO SHOW ANOTHER TONIGHT BECAUSE SHE'S ACTUALLY ON THE COMMISSION FOR PROJECT JUST FOR CLARIFICATION I THINK WHAT SHE'S ASKING AND IF I'M WRONG PLEASE CORRECT ME MISS BURKE IS THE QUESTION IS THE COMMENTS ABOUT THE THIRTY FIVE HOURS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE THAT MATT IS THAT CORRECT YES OKAY NOT THE HEALTH FRAUD COMMISSION WHICH IS A DIFFERENT WHICH HAS A VERY WHICH IS FOCUSED ONLY ON THE FINANCING A PUBLICLY UNIFIED FINANCING SO SO THAT'S THAT THAT'S EXACTLY THAT'S QUESTIONS SHE'S ANGRY THANK YOU FOR THAT YES AND ALSO ASK IS CONSTITUTED AND WELL I GUESS IN THE SAME TIME HAVE ANY OF THE COMMENTS FROM THE CHAIR BEEN INCLUDED IN THIS MEASURE AS OF TODAY WELL THEY WILL BE BECAUSE IS THE THE STAFF ANALYSIS JUST CAME OUT AND WE'RE MORE THAN HAPPY AND I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE CHAIR LOOK AT THE END OF THE DAY IF THIS MOVES FORWARD -- IT SURE WAS GOING TO BE A PART OF WHAT IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE GOING FORWARD ABSOLUTELY BUT THE FACT IS IS THAT AFTER A YEAR NON HAVE BEEN TAKEN IS THAT CORRECT ALL THESE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE PART OF THE ANALYSIS YET HAVE YOU NOT MET WITH THE CHAIR UP AND OVER THE LAST YEAR I HAVE HAD IT WITH THE CHEN AND HAVE ANY OF HIS COMMENTS IN YOUR CONVERSATIONS OR YOUR CONVERSATIONS WITH YOUR SPONSOR IF THE I DON'T KNOW IF THE RESPONSE -- -- BEEN INTEGRATED INTO FOURTEEN HUNDRED AS WE SEE IT TODAY AFTER ONE YEAR OF BEING IN PRINT WILL NOT I MEAN IT'S NOT A REALLY HARD QUESTION THIS IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE EASIEST QUESTIONS WE'VE ASKED TODAY I THINK OF MOST PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW THE RESIDENT I HAVE ALSO WERE PREFERRED PLUS SPONSORS IN TERMS OF THE DEGREE OF SPECIFICITY AS TO SOME OF THE ISSUES I DO KNOW SOME OF THE ISSUES -- MAY HAVE BEEN WELL AWARE OF THE EVENTS BUT THE DEGREE OF SPECIFICITY IS THE STAFF ANALYSIS AS TO THE ISSUES WERE RAISED AS WELL AS SURE WHAT INDICATED -- ARE THINGS THAT WE'RE GOING TO WORK WITH THEM ON I'M THROUGH THE CHAIR HAVE HAD THERE BEEN ANY AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL SINCE ITS INTRODUCTION TIME NO OKAY THANK YOU -- SO THE STATE HAS A FIFTEEN PERCENT CAP ON HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES ADMINISTRATION FEES THE REST MUST GO TO PATIENT CARE I'M NOT SAYING THE SYSTEM IS NOT BROKEN BUT I DO WONDER WHAT ARE THE CONS WHAT ARE THE COST CONTAINMENT MEASURES THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN THIS BILL THE DALLAS MISS CONSTI THIS BECOMING SECURE IF YOU'RE THERE I'M YES -- FOR COST CONTAINMENT MEASURES YOU KNOW I I I WENT OVER SOME OF THEM AND AND AND AND CREATE THE QUESTION -- -- THE THE COST CONTAINMENT MEASURES YOU KNOW ONE OVERALL IT'S IT'S A SYSTEM OVERALL BY GETTING EVERYBODY INTO ONE SINGLE RISK POOL -- THERE ARE -- YOU KNOW WE'RE LOWERING THE COST -- COMPLETELY TO TO THE SYSTEM -- AND YOU KNOW KIND OF TO POINT TO THE WORK ON THE COMMISSION AGAIN YOU KNOW THE COMMISSION HANDS COST OF THE VERY SIMILAR TYPE OF SYSTEM AND YOU KNOW I'VE WORKED VERY TIRELESSLY WITH OUR CONSULTANTS TO ENSURE THAT PAYMENT SCENARIO THAT THAT THAT THEY HAVE IN THEIR ECONOMIC ANALYSIS INCLUDES MANY MANY OF THE ELEMENTS OF AB FOURTEEN HUNDRED EVEN IF IT DOESN'T SAY IT IN AND AND NAME -- HE -- FOR EXAMPLE THE DIRECT PAYMENTS -- INCLUDES GLOBAL BUDGETING -- GLOBAL BUDGETING -- FOR EXAMPLE WOULD BE A COST CONTAINMENT MEASURE BECAUSE IT WOULD BE ENSURING THAT THE PAYMENTS THAT ARE PAID TOWARD HOSPITALS ARE CLOSER TO ACT THE ACTUAL COST OF CARE RATHER THAN -- RATHER THAN -- DOLLARS GOING TO TO ON TOP OF THAT THERE WOULD BE A BETTER DISTRIBUTION OF THE THE COST OF -- -- OF THAT CARE THE COST CONTAINMENT MEASURES CALM BECAUSE WE SIMPLY SIMPLE FLYING -- THAT THE SYSTEM ITSELF WE BEACH SIMPLIFYING THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE SYSTEM -- AND YOU KNOW ONE OF THE ONE OF THE STATISTICS FROM THE HEALTHY CALIFORNIA FOR ALL COMMISSION THAT I WANNA DRAW FOR YOU FOR YOU ALL -- THAT WAS PRESENTED TO US -- YOU KNOW -- ENTITIES -- WILL SPEND ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE BILLION SERVICES HOSPITALS PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE FACILITIES WILL SPEND ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE BILLION OR LESS IN ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS -- -- ONLY ON BILLING AND INSURANCE RELATED COSTS IT THERE IF THERE ARE OTHER COSTS THAT -- THAT THE COST SAVINGS FOR HOSPITAL CITIZENS AND AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS -- SO THAT IS THE COST CONTAINMENT AND OF ITSELF ON ON EIGHTY ONE THIRTY ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS BECAUSE -- HOSPITALS WOULDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH HUNDREDS OF OF -- INSURANCE PLANS -- DOCTORS WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO HAVE TO DO THAT AND THERE'D BE TIME SAVINGS ASSOCIATED TO WHICH AGAIN WOULD BE -- -- ENSURING THAT -- THERE'D BE MORE MORE ABILITY OF DOCTORS TO PRIVATE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CARE -- AND ANOTHER HUGE PART IS THE NEGOTIATING POWER OF THE SYSTEM ITSELF TO NEGOTIATE AND AND -- AND RATES GENERALLY AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA SAID YOU KNOW THERE WOULD BE PRICE NEGOTIATIONS -- BOTH WAYS HOSPITALS DIRECTLY EACH INDIVIDUAL HOSTER HOSPITAL DIRECTLY AND WITH OTHER TYPES OF PROVIDERS AND THAT WOULD THAT IT IT SO THAT WE HAVE SOME SANITY IN AND IN HOW DOCTORS ARE PAID TO THAT PART -- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS WOULD BE PAID MORE WHEREAS IF THERE ARE PROCEDURE BASED TYPES OF CARE THAT THAT WE COULD NEGOTIATE LOWER PRICES IF IT IF IT'S APPROPRIATE -- ALSO I'VE HEARD YOU SAY THAT ACTUALLY EARLIER TODAY I GUESS MY QUESTION IS BESIDES BE A RADICAL COST CONTAINMENT ARE THERE SPECIFIC CAPS FOR THE STATE IN ALL OF THIS IN THEIR SPENDING WE ARE NOT WE DON'T HAVE A HISTORY OF STAYING ON BUDGET UNFORTUNATELY NOT IN OUR TECH PROJECTS NOT IN ANY OF OUR PROJECTS REALLY SO MY QUESTION IS I UNDERSTAND THE THEORY I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE POSSIBLE HOWEVER MY QUESTION IS IS WE REQUIRE OTHERS TO HAVE SPECIFIC CAPS HAVE WE DECIDED TO PUT SPECIFIC CAPS ON OURSELVES ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ARE I WONDER RATE HERE SO WE HAVE HAD THIS DISCUSSION THIS IS THAT YOU KNOW I THE DISCUSSION THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE HEALTHY CALIFORNIA FOR ALL COMMISSION YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT HOW CAN WE HAVE OVERALL -- OVERALL COST CONTROLS OF THE SYSTEM ITSELF AND YOU KNOW IT IT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT -- ONE WE'RE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION TONIGHT AND YOU KNOW I THINK WE WE CAN HAVE MORE OF THESE DISCUSSIONS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT -- ACA LEVIN DON'T HAVE TO HAVE SOME SOME GOLDEN TO MONITOR THE SYSTEM CAP THAT THAT THERE WOULD BE EXPLICIT SPENDING LIMITS I THINK THAT WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE SYSTEM BECAUSE THAT'S HOW HE HOW WOULD THE SYSTEM MAY NOT GROW APPROPRIATELY BASED ON INDEX -- BUT BASED ON DIFFERENT STRUCTURED -- AND IT AND -- GDP GDP GROWTH -- ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER AND YOU KNOW WE DON'T ENVISION EXPLICIT -- EXPLICIT COST CAPS WHERE THEY'RE SPENDING LIMITS THAT WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO COME BACK TO ALL OF YOU -- YEAR AFTER YEAR TO INCREASE THE THE BUDGET I THINK THAT WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL FOR THE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S HOW WE ACTUALLY END UP GETTING INTO THE SITUATION WHERE WE MIGHT HAVE A LIMITED BUDGET -- WORD THERE MIGHT HAVE TO BE SOME CUTS TO THE BENEFIT AND AND THAT IS NOT WHAT WE WANT AND I HATE TO SAY THIS BUT NOW WE'RE STARTING USING THOSE EXCUSES MAKES US TO START SO MAKING THE HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY SO WITH THAT AND WE'VE HAD A YEAR TO HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS AND I THINK PART OF THE FRUSTRATION I THINK YOU'RE SEEING FROM NOT JUST MYSELF BUT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES IS THAT THESE CONVERSATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN HAD OVER THE LAST YEAR THE FACT THAT THIS BILL IS BEING ASKED TO BE PASSED NOW AND HAVE CONVERSATIONS LATER MAKES VERY LITTLE LOGICAL SENSE BUT HAVING SAID THAT I WOULD SAY THAT HAVE THE OPPOSITION ACTUALLY WORKED ON COST CONTAINMENT AND HEALTH CARE FOR ALL WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T STILL BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION SO ON SOME LEVEL I ACTUALLY APPLAUD CNA FOR THEIR TENACITY IN PUSHING THIS BILL AND THIS CONCEPT UNTIL YESTERDAY THERE THEY REALLY WERE THE ONLY ONES THAT IT TAKEN PEN TO PAPER IN SEARCH OF THIS OF A SOLUTION TO CHIEF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR THE GREATEST NUMBER OF PEOPLE AT THE LOWEST COST BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY WE WE AND WHEN I SAY WE I MEAN ALL OF US HAVE FAILED TO PRODUCE ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY THOUGH I HOPE THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND THE CHAIR'S OFFICE ACCOUNTABILITY SOON A LOT OF THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE TO THE AUTHOR'S COMMENTS I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE ACA IS NOT REQUIRED TO PASS THIS BILL AND IT IS A HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR TAX INCREASE NOT JUST FOR BUSINESS BUT FOR THOSE MAKING FORTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND UP THE TAXI THAT TAX UBLE INCOME OF THOSE MAKING A HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE THOUSAND AND UP WILL BE TAXED TWICE A PAYROLL TAX AND AN INCOME TAX AS WELL AS A SWIPE AT PROP NINETY EIGHT EDUCATION FUNDS BEGAN LIMIT PROP THIRTEEN AND MAKING TAX FOR THIS ONE MAJORITY VOTE INSTEAD OF TWO THIRDS THAT BEING SAID IF AB FOURTEEN HUNDRED PASSES THIS COMMITTEE TODAY AND THE ACA IS REFERRED WHICH IT SOUNDS LIKE NOW IT'S NOT EVEN SOMETHING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT BEING REFERRED -- IF IT'S IF IT'S REFER TO MY COMMITTEE THEN WE WILL HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AND I WANT TO ASSURE EVERYONE THAT THAT CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT WILL BE DISCUSSED I THINK IF WE PASS THIS AND WE DON'T DISCUSS PROPOSED FUNDING MECHANISM WE ARE MAKING EVEN MORE OF A MOCKERY OF THIS PROCESS I WILL NOT SUPPORT A CA AND ITS CURRENT FORM BUT IF THIS BODY DEEMS IT FIT TO PASS AND UNFUNDED SINGLE PAYER BILL THEN WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY FOR IT AND I WANT TO ASSURE EVERYONE THAT CONVERSATION WILL BE HAD HI AND THIS IS THE HARDEST PART FOR ME IS THAT THE TRUTH IS IF WE DON'T WE ARE EXACTLY WHAT THE PEOPLE DISTRUST ABOUT THIS SYSTEM WE ARE PASSING SOMETHING TO BENEFIT PEOPLE BUT IT'S REALLY JUST AN MPC SIMPLE SIMPLE IF IT'S NOT JOINED TO A FUNDING MECHANISM IT DOES NOT BRING HEALTH CARE TO EVEN ONE MORE PERSON WITHOUT TWENTY THIS BILL HAS BEEN SOLD TO MY COMMUNITY THAT IT IS GOING TO CHANGE THINGS NOW AND THAT IT IS FREE AND NEITHER ONE OF THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND HIS STAFF FOR EVERYTHING THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TOWARD OVER THESE LAST FEW YEARS OF THIS PROCESS AND UP UNTIL NOW IT HAS BEEN A VERY THANKLESS PROCESS AND I AM AWARE OF IT BUT I TRULY HOPE THAT IN THE WEEKS TO COME WE TRULY PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS IF WE CAN DO THAT WE CAN MOVE FROM A PROMISE TO CHANGE NVAX I BELIEVE IT'S SOMETHING WE CAN BE PROUD OF I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS WHO HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CARILLO A SECOND BY MISTER NAZARIAN THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS MISTER CAR WHICH WENT CLOSE THANK THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN ONE OF THE DRESS A COUPLE THINGS -- A PRETTY CLEAR IMPLICATION THAT SOMEHOW I HAD TO DO SOMETHING AND THEN JUST LET IT SIT AND THEN JUST BROUGHT IT BACK AND EXPECT YOU TO PASS IT AND THAT SOMEHOW SPONSOR THINK THIS BILL IS PERFECT AND NOTHING I TO HIGHLIGHT IS PERFECT I WOULD NEVER SUGGEST ANYTHING I BRING HAD HUNDREDS OF HOURS OF THE MEETINGS AND CONVERSATIONS I'VE SPOKEN WITH DOZENS OF COLLEAGUES MOST OF THEM ON THEIR OWN URGING AND THEY REACH OUT TO ME AND I'VE TALKED TO THEM -- AND YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN CALLED A LOT OF THINGS AND ACCESSIBLE IS USUALLY NOT ONE OF THEM BUT IF I FOR A REASON THAT WAY I APOLOGIZE THAT'S MY FEELING NOT THE FEELING OF THE SPONSORS OR THOSE THAT ARE ADVOCATING FOR THIS BILL I WILL SAY THAT THERE WAS NO ASSURANCES -- WHEN WHEN I HELD THE BILL IN APRIL -- THAT WOULD BE HEARD IT AND I KNEW THAT AT THE TIME -- THERE IS NO ASSURANCES THAT -- BUT WE WOULD BE HERE TODAY AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE WHAT THAT ALLOWED FOR IN A GOOD WAY WAS FOR ME TO NUMBER CONTINUE TO DO MY STUDY WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF HHS AND -- IN WASHINGTON DC I THINK THAT HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT IN IN THE BILL BEING REFERRED IN SPEAKING WITH THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE FROM THE SPEAKER OF OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS AND MONTHS -- IT WAS UP TO ME AND OF THOSE OF US THAT ARE SUPPORTING FOURTEEN HUNDRED TO GET A HEARING AND TO HAVE IT REFERRED AND THE IN THE THE WHEN I SAY THAT THE QUESTIONS POSED BY THE CHAIR -- LOOKING ON TOLD THE OF THE BILLS REFERRED -- HELP ME STOP THIS YEAR THEY DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT IS GOING TO BE REFERRED AS WHAT I'VE -- WHEN I MENTION ALL THAT BUT I'M ESSENTIALLY SAYING IS THAT WE ARE BEING POSED WITH RESPONSIBLE SUGGESTIONS AND THOUGHTS FROM THE CHAIR THAT ARE NOT IGNORED QUITE TO THE CONTRARY -- THE THE THE CHAIR WILL BE INTEGRAL IN ENSURING THAT -- THERE THERE'S A BILL THAT WORKS AND MAKES SENSE HE HAS HIS OWN OF LEVEL EXPERTISE IS BROUGHT TO THE TABLE AND YOU KNOW THE MY MY STAFF THE SPONSORS HAVE RESPONDED TO HUNDREDS OF QUESTIONS OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS -- THAT HAVE COME TO THEM -- AND EVEN THE QUESTIONS POSED BY MID DECEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY WE HAVEN'T WE HAVE RESPONSES FOR THOSE QUESTIONS AND AND ARE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THEM -- NOW IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE SPECIFICITY OF ACCOUNT IS A PROGRAM INTO A BEER SEE THAT'S THE THAT'S THE QUESTION AND AND CERTAINLY IN -- SUNSCREEN CONSULTATION WITH THE WITH THE CHAIR AND HIS STAFF AS TO HOW MUCH SPECIFICITY YOU WANT IN A POSSIBLE THIS NATURE BECAUSE THE MORE SPECIFICITY MEANS ANYTIME YOU WANT TO CHANGE THAT TO GO BACK LEGISLATURE AND IF IT'S LINE ITEM BY LINE ITEM THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY WHAT YOU WANT IN A PROGRAM LIKE THIS THOSE THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS AND -- THAT THAT NEED TO BE RESOLVED IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH SPECIFICITY -- TO PUT INTO THE BILL BUT I ASSURE YOU THAT THE SPONSORS AND MYSELF HAVE ABSOLUTELY PUSH FOR MANAGEMENT OF TIME INTO PREPARING FEEDBACK MMHM IN THE PHARMACY JORDANA FEEDBACK YOU'VE GOTTEN HAS BEEN ON FUNDING -- AND AS OPPOSED TO ANY OTHER LEGISLATOR THAT IS STILL IN THIS BUILDING IN THE PAST WE PUT FOR FUNDING NO ONE'S ON THE BEFORE IS A PERFECT PEOPLE HAVE ISSUES WITH IT THEY HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO THE WHOLE POINT OF PUTTING IT OUT THERE SO THAT YOU KNOW THAT THAT THERE'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE ANALYZED AND DISCUSSED AND DEBATED AND CHANGED -- ACCORDINGLY AND THEN SO THAT THAT WAS REALLY THE THE PRIMARY BILL -- NOT BEING HEARD OF LAST YEAR THAT IS SOMETHING WE WORKED WE WE WORKED ON TO TRY TO PUT SOMETHING FORWARD I KNOW THAT THE CHAIR BURKE THE THEIR LEGITIMATE CONCERNS BUT THE REALITY IS THAT RIGHT NOW EMPLOYERS PAY NINE POINT NINE PERCENT OF PAYROLL FOR HEALTHCARE EMPLOYEES PAY TWO POINT SEVEN PERCENT THE BILL FOR HEALTHCARE AND SAW ONE POINT TWO FIVE PERCENT PAYROLL TAX FOR EMPLOYERS IS FAR MORE GENEROUS -- BUT AGAIN I KNOW WE'RE NOT HERE TO DEBATE FACING A LOT OF US WANT TO MENTION THAT THESE CONSIDERATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE IN TERMS OF THE FIRST ITERATION HAS BEEN PUT OUT THERE THAT DOES ALLOW US THE TIME -- THE DIVE DEEPER INTO IT -- AND IT IS CERTAINLY MY INTENTION IF IT'S THE WILL OF OF OF THE SERVER OF OF HAVE YOU TAXATION TO HAVE THE BILL HEARD IS NOT A IT WASN'T PUT FORWARD A FOR ANY OTHER REASON BUT IN TERMS OF THE ORDER OF THINGS AS I MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT WHERE BIRTH FOLLOWING AN ORDER THAT ALLOWS A WAIVER TO BE APPLIED FOR -- IT WAS VERY DIRECTLY IN THIS IS GONNA BE MET FOR WELL OVER AN HOUR THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH HUMAN SERVICES THERE ARE VERY CLEAR THAT LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY THROUGH A POLICY BILL NEEDS TO BE PASSED EVEN APPLY FOR A WAIVER -- AND THE FISCAL COMPONENT OF IT DOES NOT NEED TO BE PART OF THAT AND THE REASON WHY IS THAT THE WAIVER APPLICATION PROCESS HOUSE TO SPEAK TO THE LARGER FINANCING AND WHAT YOU WOULD NEED IN THE FINANCING ON ULTIMATELY ABSOLUTELY VOTERS CAN VOTE SOMETHING DOWN ABSOLUTELY -- SOMETHING MAY NOT MAKE IT ALL THE WAY TO THE GOAL LINE -- AND YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT -- THIS ENFORCEMENT TRIED I SAID THAT THE BEGINNING AS WELL THAT IT'S THIS IS NOT A MATTER OF TRYING TO BE PERFECT IT'S A MATTER OF UNDERSTANDING THAT WHAT WE ARE SEEING IN OUR SYSTEM EVEN WITH ALL THE WORK THAT SURE WOULD AND SO MANY YOU DON'T OVER THE YEARS WERE STILL SEEING INCREASING HEALTHCARE COSTS WERE STILL SAYING LACK OF ACCESS WE'RE STILL SEEING PEOPLE DYING WE'RE STILL SEEING THAT THERE ISN'T THAT MANY O'CLOCK THAT MEET MEANINGFUL ACCESS AS OPPOSED TO JUST HAVING INSURANCE VERSUS REALLY GETTING THE CARE -- OF THAT IS GOING TO SAVE YOUR LIFE OR MAKERS I PERSONALLY BETTER BOB THAT IS WHY THE SINGLE PAYER HEALTHCARE PROGRAM WHICH IS BEEN STUDIED FOR YEARS -- AND I KNOW IT'S EASY TO SAY POINT ONE COUNTRY OTHER LOOK WE'RE NOT CANADA WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE IN CANADA HAS PROVINCIALLY RUN SYSTEMS NOT A SINGLE PROVINCE IN CANADA IS ANYWHERE NEAR THE SIZE OF OUR STATE FOR THE SIZE OF OUR ECONOMY AND SO -- YOU KNOW IT IT I KNOW THAT WENDELL POTTER OF FORMER INSURANCE INDUSTRY EXECUTIVE -- SILVA SPEAKS OF HOW HE WAS VERY INTENTIONALLY HIT ATTENTIONAL PART OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY THE BEST CANADA AND TO BASH IT IS TO MAKE PEOPLE AFRAID OF DOING ANYTHING THAT IS DIFFERENT -- I KNOW THAT NO ONE HERE EXCEPT THE STATUS QUO AND THAT'S WHY ALSO SAID IN THE INTRO THAT WORK IS BEEN DONE HAS BEEN CLEARED HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE STATUS QUO IS NOT ACCEPTED BY THOSE IN THIS COMMITTEE OR A BODY -- BUT WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE TRUE IS THAT A SINGLE PAYER HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND IF IF THERE ARE ISSUES OF THE THAT THE CHAIR I THINK RAISES SOME ISSUES WITH -- FOURTEEN HUNDRED I THINK OUR ARE REASONABLE -- ISSUES FOR US TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON OTHER OTHER FOLKS THAT HAVE LOOKED AT IT AS AS KIM WANT TO TREAT THIS SOME LANGUAGE ISSUE THERE FOR GOVERNANCE ISSUES THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT -- WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE TAKING IN AND MORE THAN HAPPY TO NOT JUST TALK ABOUT THE TO AMEND IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT IT'S A BILL THAT WORKS BUT LIKE I SAID WITH THIS BILL HAS BEEN AROUND -- FOR QUITE SOME TIME I'VE I'VE I'VE SPOKEN TO MANY COLLEAGUES ABOUT IT AND WE'VE GOTTEN VERY OTHER THAN FROM THE CHAIR OF THE STUFF ANALYSIS FROM WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN DIRECT REQUEST TO AMEND -- FROM COLLEAGUES WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN MANY DIRECT REQUEST TO AMEND FOR OUTSIDE ENTITIES EXCEPT FOR THOSE THAT OPPOSE IT -- AND SO YOU KNOW I'M LOOKING OUT I'M I'VE BEEN HERE I'VE ALWAYS BEEN HERE I'VE ALWAYS BEEN MADE MYSELF AVAILABLE AND ACCESSIBLE -- AND OVER THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO AND LOOK FOR THE BLOCKING OFF HOURS AND HOURS OF MY TIME -- FOR ANYONE THAT WANTS TO MEET OR HAVE THEIR STATUS MEET WITH ME TO DISCUSS DETAILS OF THE BILL AND TO HAVE QUESTIONS ANSWERED THIS IS A STARTING POINT IN TERMS OF A LONGER PROCESS AS THE CHAIR ASKED EARLIER HONEST CONVERSATIONS BUT WAIT A MINUTE THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN TERMS OF I HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM I THINK ABOUT THOSE THAT ARE SUFFERING THERE'S PLENTY OF PEOPLE THAT SUFFER IN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM THAT WE NEED TO BE THERE FOR THEM WE NEED TO BE THERE FOR OF THOSE PLACES THAT DON'T GET HURT -- FOR THOSE THAT ARE STUCK IN A JOB OR AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP AND DON'T LEAVE BECAUSE THEY HAVE HEALTH CARE THEY DON'T WANT TO LOSE IT FOR THOSE LAWS ON HOUSE NEIGHBORS THAT FELL INTO HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE OF MEDICAL BILLS -- AND FOR THE YOUNGER GENERATION AN ADULT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE WANT TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS AND ANOTHER GROUP OF LEGISLATORS ARE GRAPPLING WITH OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS EVEN THAT MUCH MORE OUT OF REACH AND THAT MUCH MORE PAINFUL FOR CALIFORNIANS -- I HEAR THE CRITICISM I HEAR THE CRITICISM OF THE PERSONAL CRITICISM OF MYSELF -- BUT I WILL SAY THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY -- THIS SOMETHING AB FOUR TWO HUNDRED I BELIEVE IS A VERY WELL WRITTEN POLICY BILL AND IT IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT MANY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF PAST BILLS AND FEEDBACK FROM COMMITTEES AND COMMISSIONS AND STUDIES -- IT'S BETTER THAN FIVE SIX TWO THE PRESIDENT OF DIFFERENT COST CONTAINMENT MEASURES AND OTHER ELEMENTS THAT ARE IN AND SO I'M NOT SUGGESTING AND NEVER WOULD THAT IS PERFECT BECAUSE IT'S NOT NO BILL IS WHAT I AM SAYING IS THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO WORK TOGETHER TO TRY OUR BEST TO BRING A SYSTEM THAT FOCUSES NOT JUST ON HEALTHCARE JUSTICE IN THE PRINCIPLE BUT ACTUALLY BRING HEALTH CARE TO EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIA IN OUR STATE IN A WAY THAT'S DIGNIFIED AND THE WAY THAT SAVES US MONEY AND IN A WAY THAT I BELIEVE WE CAN DO IF WE'RE AS COMMITTED AS THE CHAIR AND SO MANY OF YOU ARE WITH
