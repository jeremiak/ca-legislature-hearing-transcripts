IT STREAMLINED. IT IT HOW HE

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:26.469
KEEPS IN MIND SOME OF THE

01:03:26.536 --> 01:03:27.703
ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THE

01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:30.239
PANDEMIC. AND THE BURDENS AND

01:03:30.306 --> 01:03:31.841
MAKING AND WE'RE MINDFUL OF

01:03:31.908 --> 01:03:34.477
THAT TOO IT'S BASED ON A

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:36.946
POLLUTER PAYS PRINCIPLE. AND

01:03:37.013 --> 01:03:39.215
AND IT IT WILL SERVE US IT WILL

01:03:39.282 --> 01:03:40.883
SERVE US TILL SUCH TIME AS A

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:42.652
BOARD CAN DECIDE WHAT

01:03:42.718 --> 01:03:43.986
ADDITIONAL CHANGES MIGHT NEED

01:03:44.053 --> 01:03:46.189
TO BE MADE DOWN THE ROAD. AND

01:03:46.255 --> 01:03:48.724
INCLUDING- JUST CONTINUE YOU

01:03:48.791 --> 01:03:50.159
KNOW OUR FEES HAVE NOT BEEN

01:03:50.226 --> 01:03:52.361
ADJUSTED SINCE NINETEEN NINETY

01:03:52.428 --> 01:03:53.696
EIGHT AND I THINK YOU ALL KNOW

01:03:53.763 --> 01:03:55.231
THAT BUT IT BEARS REPEATING.

01:03:55.298 --> 01:03:58.568
THAT IT YOU KNOW WE CAN'T WAIT.

01:03:58.634 --> 01:04:00.503
WE WE'RE ALREADY A YEAR LATE

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:02.805
BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. AND

01:04:02.872 --> 01:04:04.607
NOW TO WAIT AGAIN FOR A FEW

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:06.676
TASK FORCE TO COME UP WITH AN

01:04:06.742 --> 01:04:07.843
ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL WE THINK

01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:10.279
WOULD BE. QUITE CHALLENGING FOR

01:04:10.346 --> 01:04:12.148
US AND FOR THE DEPARTMENT JUST

01:04:12.215 --> 01:04:12.748
BECAUSE OF THE BURDENS ON THE

01:04:12.815 --> 01:04:15.017
GENERAL FUND. SO THAT'S ONE OF

01:04:15.084 --> 01:04:16.052
THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

01:04:16.118 --> 01:04:19.021
DIFFERENCES- AND THEN I WOULD I

01:04:19.088 --> 01:04:21.824
WOULD ONLY HIGHLIGHT THAT- WE

01:04:21.891 --> 01:04:24.260
ARE HAVING ONGOING ENGAGEMENT

01:04:24.327 --> 01:04:25.728
WITH YOU I'VE NEVER HAD THE%

01:04:25.795 --> 01:04:27.597
OPPORTUNITY MAYBE MEET WITH

01:04:27.663 --> 01:04:28.998
SOME OF YOU ONE ON ONE. THE

01:04:29.065 --> 01:04:30.433
LEDGE THAT HAS MADE THEMSELVES

01:04:30.499 --> 01:04:32.435
AVAILABLE FOR WEEKLY DETAILED

01:04:32.501 --> 01:04:33.803
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT THE

01:04:33.869 --> 01:04:35.705
ISSUES ARE AND WHERE THEY KEEP

01:04:35.771 --> 01:04:36.872
POINTS OF CONCERN ARE WE'RE

01:04:36.939 --> 01:04:39.075
HAVING SIMILAR MEETINGS. WITH

01:04:39.141 --> 01:04:40.209
COMMUNITY BASED JUST THE

01:04:40.276 --> 01:04:41.844
ORGANIZATIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL

01:04:41.911 --> 01:04:43.512
JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS AND WITH

01:04:43.579 --> 01:04:45.114
THE REGULATED COMMUNITY AND

01:04:45.181 --> 01:04:46.916
IT'S THROUGH THAT PROCESS THAT

01:04:46.983 --> 01:04:49.252
WE WILL REALLY UNDERSTAND. WHAT

01:04:49.318 --> 01:04:52.088
ELSE NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN ORDER

01:04:52.154 --> 01:04:53.556
FOR US TO HAVE ENOUGH ALIGNMENT

01:04:53.623 --> 01:04:56.025
TO MOVE THIS FORWARD THROUGH

01:04:56.092 --> 01:04:57.827
THE BUDGET PROCESS. WITH THAT I

01:04:57.893 --> 01:04:59.161
WILL STOP THERE AND HAPPY TO BE

01:04:59.228 --> 01:05:00.596
AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY

01:05:00.663 --> 01:05:02.064
QUESTIONS AND I APPRECIATE THE

01:05:02.131 --> 01:05:04.634
OPPORTUNITY. THAT YOU PROVIDED

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:06.836
FOR THE ENGAGEMENT FOR THE LEAD

01:05:06.902 --> 01:05:08.904
STAFF ENGAGEMENT AND FOR FUTURE

01:05:08.971 --> 01:05:10.840
DISCUSSIONS TO KEEP KEEP THE

01:05:10.906 --> 01:05:12.808
PROCESS MOVING SO DR MEREDITH

01:05:12.875 --> 01:05:13.843
IF YOU COULD STAY UP FOR

01:05:13.909 --> 01:05:15.845
MANAGER. SO WHAT ARE THE MAIN

01:05:15.911 --> 01:05:17.680
DIFFERENCES RIGHT NOW BETWEEN

01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:19.515
THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL AND

01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:21.651
THE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE

01:05:21.717 --> 01:05:23.819
BEFORE US IN AB ONE. WELL

01:05:23.886 --> 01:05:25.354
NUMBER ONE FIRST AND FOREMOST I

01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:26.622
WOULD SAY IS THAT THE

01:05:26.689 --> 01:05:27.823
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FEW TASK

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:29.625
FORCE- WE ARE NOT CALLING FOR A

01:05:29.692 --> 01:05:31.127
FEW TASK FORCE BECAUSE WE FEEL

01:05:31.193 --> 01:05:32.628
CONFIDENT ABOUT THE ANALYSIS

01:05:32.695 --> 01:05:34.263
WE'VE DONE IN THE BASIS FOR

01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:39.435
RAISING THE FEES- AND- AND WE

01:05:39.502 --> 01:05:41.904
LOOKED AT A NUMBER. OF POSSIBLE

01:05:41.971 --> 01:05:45.174
MODELS TO STRUCTURE THE FEES

01:05:45.241 --> 01:05:46.108
AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BOTH

01:05:46.175 --> 01:05:47.743
TASK AT HAND TO SPEAK MORE

01:05:47.810 --> 01:05:49.445
DIRECTLY INTO THE WE'RE TOUGH

01:05:49.512 --> 01:05:52.515
WE'RE WE ARE PROPOSING CHANGES

01:05:52.581 --> 01:05:55.017
TO BOTH TOSCA AND THE HEAT H.

01:05:55.084 --> 01:05:59.221
W. CA. FUNDING SO IT'S MORE

01:05:59.288 --> 01:06:01.657
COMPREHENSIVE IN THAT SENSE- SO

01:06:01.724 --> 01:06:03.292
THAT I THINK THAT THE FEE

01:06:03.359 --> 01:06:05.461
STRUCTURE IS THE BIGGEST-

01:06:05.528 --> 01:06:06.962
DIFFERENCE THERE ARE

01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:08.331
DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF THE

01:06:08.397 --> 01:06:10.533
CONSTITUENCIES IN THE BOARDS

01:06:10.599 --> 01:06:11.233
AND SOME OF THE DETAILS BUT

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:13.936
HONESTLY.I DON'T SEE THOSE AS

01:06:14.003 --> 01:06:18.941
BEING- AS- I ICS IS HAVING VERY

01:06:19.008 --> 01:06:20.843
PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:23.713
THOSE ISSUES AND I'M I'M

01:06:23.779 --> 01:06:25.348
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT RESOLUTION.

01:06:25.414 --> 01:06:27.516
ALL RIGHT SO FOR THE MEMBERS IF

01:06:27.583 --> 01:06:29.218
YOU HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT

01:06:29.285 --> 01:06:30.853
PARTICULARLY THE FEE TASK FORCE

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:32.488
NOT BEING HANDLED WILL WANT TO

01:06:32.555 --> 01:06:35.458
HEAR FROM YOU ABOUT THAT- I

01:06:35.524 --> 01:06:37.426
WILL ADD THAT I THINK THAT THE

01:06:37.493 --> 01:06:39.462
ADDITIONAL- PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE

01:06:39.528 --> 01:06:41.697
LOOKING FOR ESSENTIAL AND THAT

01:06:41.764 --> 01:06:42.498
YOU CAN'T GET YOUR JOB DONE

01:06:42.565 --> 01:06:44.533
WITHOUT THEM. HOWEVER I KNOW

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.202
THAT- MANY OF THE MEMBERS HERE

01:06:46.268 --> 01:06:47.603
ARE CONCERNED THAT THE MONEY BE

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:52.608
WELL SPENT. AND THAT- GIVEN THE

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:53.809
PROBLEMS THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN

01:06:53.876 --> 01:06:56.545
THE PAST HOW CAN WE BE ASSURED

01:06:56.612 --> 01:06:57.113
THAT THAT MONEY WILL BE WELL

01:06:57.179 --> 01:07:00.416
SPENT. WELL I THINK THE

01:07:00.483 --> 01:07:01.951
WORKLOAD ANALYSIS REALLY TELLS

01:07:02.017 --> 01:07:03.719
A STORY ABOUT HOW WE ARE

01:07:03.786 --> 01:07:04.920
SPENDING THE MONEY AND WHAT

01:07:04.987 --> 01:07:08.157
RESOURCES WE ARE- WHAT WE'RE

01:07:08.224 --> 01:07:09.625
DOING WITH THE RESOURCES AND WE

01:07:09.692 --> 01:07:11.594
CAN NOW BUILD ON THAT TO

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:13.596
PROVIDE ONGOING TRANSPARENCY

01:07:13.662 --> 01:07:15.531
ABOUT OUR USE OF RESOURCES SO.

01:07:15.598 --> 01:07:17.800
NUMBER ONE THAT EFFORT IS NOT A

01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:19.535
ONE AND DONE IT WILL BE AN

01:07:19.602 --> 01:07:21.203
ONGOING CONVERSATION- I'M

01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:23.506
NUMBER TWO I THINK THERE ARE.

01:07:23.572 --> 01:07:25.074
SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LAST

01:07:25.141 --> 01:07:26.342
YEAR AND THIS YEAR NUMBER ONE

01:07:26.409 --> 01:07:28.043
THERE WAS SOME CONCERN THAT WE

01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:29.111
WEREN'T INCREASING THE LEVEL OF

01:07:29.178 --> 01:07:31.247
SERVICE OF THE DEPARTMENT AND

01:07:31.313 --> 01:07:32.648
NOW WE'RE PROPOSING TO DO THAT.

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:34.683
BUT NUMBER TWO WE HEARD THAT

01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:35.684
THERE WASN'T ENOUGH

01:07:35.751 --> 01:07:37.453
ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE PROPOSAL

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.155
THAT WE PUT FORTH LAST YEAR AND

01:07:39.221 --> 01:07:40.489
A LOT OF THOSE ACCOUNTABILITY

01:07:40.556 --> 01:07:42.591
MEASURES WERE TAKEN. INTO

01:07:42.658 --> 01:07:44.960
ACCOUNT. IN NINE NINE FIVE AND

01:07:45.027 --> 01:07:47.563
WE HAVE ADOPTED A LOT OF THOSE

01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:48.998
AND WE'RE TRYING TO SEE IF

01:07:49.064 --> 01:07:50.266
THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO GO

01:07:50.332 --> 01:07:52.134
EVEN FURTHER INCLUDING.

01:07:52.201 --> 01:07:54.703
DEADLINES IN PLACE REPORTING

01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:56.038

STRATEGY IS WHAT WE'RE WORKING

01:08:04.814 --> 01:08:06.916
ON. AND THEN I WILL SAY THAT

01:08:06.982 --> 01:08:09.452
INTERNALLY EVEN WITHOUT A BOARD

01:08:09.518 --> 01:08:11.520

WHICH IS. THIS OVERSIGHT PIECE

01:22:05.687 --> 01:22:07.155
I MEAN THIS FEE STRUCTURE

01:22:07.222 --> 01:22:08.223
INCREASES SIGNIFICANT AND I

01:22:08.290 --> 01:22:10.425
THINK WE SHOULD- BE COGNIZANT

01:22:10.492 --> 01:22:12.227
OF WHAT WE'RE ASKING BUSINESSES

01:22:12.294 --> 01:22:13.762
TO DO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT I

01:22:13.828 --> 01:22:14.963
APPRECIATE THE POLLUTERS PAY

01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:17.932
MODEL I THINK- BUT I MY CONCERN

01:22:17.999 --> 01:22:21.102
REALLY LIES IN. HANDING MONEY

01:22:21.169 --> 01:22:22.570
TO OUR DEPARTMENT THAT

01:22:22.637 --> 01:22:24.105
HISTORICALLY HASN'T DONE WHAT

01:22:24.172 --> 01:22:25.674
WE NEED IT TO DO FOR THE

01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:27.142
COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW THERE'S

01:22:27.208 --> 01:22:28.843
OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND

01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:29.444
SITES THAT NEED TO BE CLEANED

01:22:29.511 --> 01:22:30.512
UP AND I WANT TO UNDERSTAND

01:22:30.578 --> 01:22:32.113
JUST. ON A DEEPER LEVEL AND

01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:33.415
IT'S LIKE THE AUTHOR TO ADDRESS

01:22:33.481 --> 01:22:34.716
THIS AND DOCTOR WILLIAMS IF YOU

01:22:34.783 --> 01:22:37.118
WOULD LIKE TO AS WELL. HOW WE

01:22:37.185 --> 01:22:40.021
ARE REALLY ON A GRANULAR LEVEL

01:22:40.088 --> 01:22:41.289
MAKING SURE WE'RE HITTING THOSE

01:22:41.356 --> 01:22:42.490
MILESTONES ARE NOT MONEY IS

01:22:42.557 --> 01:22:43.825
BEING SPENT TO GET THOSE

01:22:43.892 --> 01:22:47.996
COMMUNITIES. THE OUTCOMES THAT

01:22:48.063 --> 01:22:50.498
THEY NEED- AT AND I THINK THE

01:22:50.565 --> 01:22:52.567
THAT GETS THE- GAP STILL NEED

01:22:52.634 --> 01:22:54.469
TO CLOSE I THINK THAT SOME-

01:22:54.536 --> 01:22:56.471
DEADLINES HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN

01:22:56.538 --> 01:22:58.740
THE BILL AND HAVING A BOARD

01:22:58.807 --> 01:22:59.507
HEALTH TO CREATE THAT

01:22:59.574 --> 01:23:00.775
ACCOUNTABILITY AS WELL ON THE

01:23:00.842 --> 01:23:02.911
TRANSPARENCY. AND THE ABILITY

01:23:02.977 --> 01:23:03.378
FOR THE PUBLIC OR THE

01:23:03.445 --> 01:23:04.979
STAKEHOLDERS TO PARTICIPATE.

01:23:05.046 --> 01:23:05.847
BUT I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE

01:23:05.914 --> 01:23:07.315
SPEED TEST VERSUS QUESTION YOU

01:23:07.382 --> 01:23:08.983
KNOW IS. IS PART OF THAT ALSO

01:23:09.050 --> 01:23:10.352
THERE'S A LOT AS A PATIENT. I

01:23:10.418 --> 01:23:11.686
WILL SAY THAT I ACKNOWLEDGE

01:23:11.753 --> 01:23:12.687
THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS NOT

01:23:12.754 --> 01:23:13.922
PROPERLY FUNDED AND SO THAT IS

01:23:13.988 --> 01:23:15.290
A PIECE OF THE PROBLEM. BUT

01:23:15.357 --> 01:23:17.258
THAT CAN BE THAT'S NOT THE ONLY

01:23:17.325 --> 01:23:17.759
PROBLEM WE HAVE SERIOUS

01:23:17.826 --> 01:23:19.194
GOVERNANCE REFORM THAT NEEDS TO

01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:21.196
HAPPEN- AND SO I THINK THAT

01:23:21.262 --> 01:23:22.230
THIS IS WHERE THIS RESTRUCTURE

01:23:22.297 --> 01:23:22.764
THIS QUESTION IS REALLY

01:23:22.831 --> 01:23:24.532
IMPORTANT. SO THAT THOSE THAT

01:23:24.599 --> 01:23:25.767
ARE PAINTED DIGITAL PHILLY

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:27.102
FEES. FILL THAT THEY'RE GETTING

01:23:27.168 --> 01:23:28.103
THIS MONEY WE'RE STILL THAT

01:23:28.169 --> 01:23:29.437
THEY'RE NOT WAITING FOR YEARS

01:23:29.504 --> 01:23:30.772
FOR A PER MAP I'VE TALKED TO

01:23:30.839 --> 01:23:32.073
FOLKS HAVE BEEN. WAITING FOR A

01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:33.608
PERMIT APPROVAL FOR FIFTEEN

01:23:33.675 --> 01:23:35.210
YEARS THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE-

01:23:35.276 --> 01:23:36.611
IT MAKES US WONDER WHAT ELSE

01:23:36.678 --> 01:23:37.946
ARE HOLDING OFF ON UNTIL. I

01:23:38.012 --> 01:23:39.347
THINK THAT THOSE ARE SOME OF

01:23:39.414 --> 01:23:40.682
THE PIECES I WOULD SAY THAT.

01:23:40.749 --> 01:23:42.951
STAFF FROM- COMMITTEE HERE HAS

01:23:43.017 --> 01:23:44.652
BEEN. A REALLY ESSENTIAL IN

01:23:44.719 --> 01:23:46.388
THIS AN IF THAT DOESN'T ANSWER

01:23:46.454 --> 01:23:50.058
YOUR QUESTION CLEARLY. THEY CAN

01:23:50.125 --> 01:23:51.726
ADD TO THAT. I'M NOT GOING TO

01:23:51.793 --> 01:23:54.529
DO. TO DRESS IN A- SURE. SO I

01:23:54.596 --> 01:23:55.697
WOULD. FOR OF ALL THAT THE FEE

01:23:55.764 --> 01:23:56.865
AUTHORITY. BEING SICK

01:23:56.931 --> 01:23:58.566
RECOMMENDED. THE BOARD. MUST

01:23:58.633 --> 01:24:01.236
MODELED AFTER OTHERS. OR ARE

01:24:01.302 --> 01:24:03.304
AROUND THIS. WATER BOARD FOR A-

01:24:03.371 --> 01:24:05.607
DO. ANY PER. FEATURE WOULD GO

01:24:05.673 --> 01:24:06.875
THROUGH THE BUDGET AND

01:24:06.941 --> 01:24:08.343
APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS SO

01:24:08.410 --> 01:24:10.879
ULTIMATELY. THE LEGISLATURE HAS

01:24:10.945 --> 01:24:13.581
THE- THE FINAL SAY ON WHETHER

01:24:13.648 --> 01:24:15.617
OR NOT ANY FUTURE CHANGES. GO

01:24:15.683 --> 01:24:17.952
THROUGH SO THERE ARE PROVISIONS

01:24:18.019 --> 01:24:19.454
AND MAX THE MEANS THAT THE THAT

01:24:19.521 --> 01:24:21.356
THE ASSEMBLY AND THE- THE

01:24:21.423 --> 01:24:22.791
SENATE. USES TO KEEP US

01:24:22.857 --> 01:24:25.560
ACCOUNTABLE. AND TO- AND TO

01:24:25.627 --> 01:24:26.628
MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ON TRACK

01:24:26.694 --> 01:24:28.029
AND THAT WE'RE- TRUSTWORTHY

01:24:28.096 --> 01:24:30.131
WITH THE FUNDS. I WILL SAY I

01:24:30.198 --> 01:24:32.367
WISH I HAD TIME TO TELL SOME OF

01:24:32.434 --> 01:24:34.068
THE SUCCESS STORIES FOR THE

01:24:34.135 --> 01:24:36.438
DEPARTMENT TODAY I DO NOT-

01:24:36.504 --> 01:24:38.406
HOWEVER. I CAN SAY ONE OF THE

01:24:38.473 --> 01:24:39.874
SECRETARIES HIGHEST PRIORITIES

01:24:39.941 --> 01:24:42.143
HAS BEEN ENFORCEMENT. AND WE

01:24:42.210 --> 01:24:43.545
HAVE TAKEN THAT VERY MUCH TO

01:24:43.611 --> 01:24:45.246
HEART AND WE HAVE TAKEN STRONG

01:24:45.313 --> 01:24:48.817
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS- WEEKLY.

01:24:48.883 --> 01:24:51.052
AGAINST AGAIN SOME OF THE MOST

01:24:51.119 --> 01:24:53.021
PROBLEMATIC TYPES OF FACILITIES

01:24:53.087 --> 01:24:54.956
IN THE STATE THAT ARE. IN THESE

01:24:55.023 --> 01:24:55.723
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:57.725
COMMUNITIES. AND THAT'S JUST

01:24:57.792 --> 01:24:58.927
ONE PLACE WHERE I CAN HIGHLIGHT

01:24:58.993 --> 01:25:00.528
SOME OF OUR SUCCESS. AND SOME

01:25:00.595 --> 01:25:02.497
OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING-

01:25:02.564 --> 01:25:03.898
THAT THAT SHOWS THAT THIS IS

01:25:03.965 --> 01:25:06.100
NOT. THE SAME D. TSC IT HAS

01:25:06.167 --> 01:25:07.635
EVOLVED IT'S RESPONDED TO THE

MANY MANY OF THE FINDINGS WITH

HAVE LEAD IN THEM BABY TEETH

02:08:03.375 --> 02:08:05.511
BECAUSE THAT IS THE LEVEL OF

THREAT THAT MY COMMUNITY AND

02:08:06.912 --> 02:08:08.514

WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT

02:08:22.594 --> 02:08:23.829
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT EVERY

02:08:23.896 --> 02:08:26.165
TIME THAT THEY PRESENT- A

02:08:26.231 --> 02:08:28.634
PROBLEM. WE'VE TRIED TO ADDRESS

02:08:28.700 --> 02:08:30.369
IT AND THEN THEY PRESENT A NEW

02:08:30.436 --> 02:08:34.706
PROBLEM AND A NEW PROBLEM AND A

02:08:34.773 --> 02:08:35.307
NEW PROBLEM UNTIL WE DON'T GET

02:08:36.809 --> 02:08:38.944

02:08:46.685 --> 02:08:47.786
THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO BRING

02:08:47.853 --> 02:08:49.388
TO THE TABLE TO CHANGE THE BILL

02:08:49.455 --> 02:08:50.522
AND STOP THE BILL OR HOLD THE

02:08:50.589 --> 02:08:52.691
BILL. THEN LET'S DO IT. BUT

02:08:52.758 --> 02:08:54.560
THIS CONTINUING CHANGING OF THE

02:08:54.626 --> 02:08:56.361
GOAL POST. IS NOT HOW WE

02:08:58.964 --> 02:08:59.932
MORE THAN WILLING I THINK I'VE

02:08:59.998 --> 02:09:02.134
SHOWN AND DEMONSTRATED THAT I'M

02:09:02.201 --> 02:09:03.402
MORE THAN WILLING TO WORK WITH

THE OPPOSITION TO GET TO A GOOD

02:09:04.870 --> 02:09:07.272

02:09:43.308 --> 02:09:45.577
PLACE. AND I HOPE THAT WE GET

CONTINUE TO CHANGE THE GOAL

02:09:49.781 --> 02:09:51.917
POSTS AND NOTHING GETS DONE. SO

02:09:51.984 --> 02:09:53.919

OF THINGS HERE FIRST OF ALL

02:10:22.281 --> 02:10:24.516
IT'S ODD TO ME THAT THE

OPPOSITION DIDN'T MENTION

02:10:26.185 --> 02:10:26.718
SOMETHING THAT'S IN OUR

ANALYSIS. UP WHICH IS THAT WE

02:10:29.821 --> 02:10:34.426
THINK IT WOULD BE BEST IF YOU-

02:10:34.493 --> 02:10:37.362
MADE THE APPEALS PROCESS- MORE

02:10:37.429 --> 02:10:41.033
CLEAR. SO IF SOMEBODY DOESN'T

02:10:41.099 --> 02:10:44.102
THINK THAT THIS IS- AND- HE-

02:10:44.169 --> 02:10:46.171
IMMINENT- THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO

MINIMIZE QUESTION WHAT THE

THRESHOLD MEANS IS WELL

02:10:59.952 --> 02:11:02.487
RESOLVED BY THE BILL THE BILL

STILL LEAKS DEAR CLEARLY STATES

02:11:05.357 --> 02:11:07.492
AS I READ FROM THE ANALYSIS THE

COOPER AND CONSULTANT IN

02:11:09.528 --> 02:11:10.963
CONSULTATION WITH A LOCAL

HEALTH OFFICER MOST RECENTLY

02:11:13.198 --> 02:11:14.800
DETERMINED THAT TE RELEASE

ENDANGERMENT TO PUBLIC HEALTH.

02:11:21.773 --> 02:11:24.943
NOTE IMMINENT AND SUBSTANTIAL.

02:11:25.010 --> 02:11:26.511
AND THE TERM REASONABLE MEANS

02:11:26.578 --> 02:11:27.946
HAVING SOUND JUDGMENT TO BE

02:11:28.013 --> 02:11:30.716
FAIR SENSIBLE INJUDICIOUS THIS

02:11:30.782 --> 02:11:32.184
TERM REASONABLE IS USED

02:11:32.251 --> 02:11:34.753
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA LAW AND

02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:36.888
IS WIDELY UNDERSTOOD. IF BOTH

02:11:36.955 --> 02:11:38.824
THE COOPER AND A LOCAL HEALTH

02:11:38.890 --> 02:11:39.925

02:27:41.986 --> 02:27:42.787
ACTUALLY A LARGE DIVERSE GROUP

02:27:42.853 --> 02:27:44.222
OF COMPOUND. THAT HAS BEEN

02:27:44.288 --> 02:27:46.224
RECOGNIZED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL

02:27:46.290 --> 02:27:47.625
COUNCIL THE STATE ABOUT.

02:27:47.692 --> 02:27:48.693
PROMOTE DEPARTMENT OF

02:27:48.759 --> 02:27:50.661
ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION AND

02:27:50.728 --> 02:27:54.498
A RECENT WORKSHOP CONVENED BY

02:27:54.565 --> 02:27:54.999
THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF

02:27:55.066 --> 02:27:56.667
SCIENCES- FLOOR. SPECIFICALLY

02:27:56.734 --> 02:27:58.336
ARE SUB CLASS OF P. FACT THAT

02:27:58.402 --> 02:27:59.437
ARE LARGE STABLE INSIDE THE

02:27:59.503 --> 02:28:00.805
MALL KILLS AND THEY DON'T RAISE

02:28:00.871 --> 02:28:02.406
CONCERNS ABOUT DEGRADATION AND

02:28:02.473 --> 02:28:04.609
MOVEMENT. BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL

02:28:04.675 --> 02:28:06.777
MEDIA LIKE SOME OF THE- SMALLER

02:28:06.844 --> 02:28:08.846
LEGACY CHEMICALS. THEY ARE

02:28:08.913 --> 02:28:11.015
NEITHER BIOAVAILABLE NOR VAIO

02:28:11.082 --> 02:28:12.984
CUMULATIVE AND THEY ARE NOT P.

02:28:13.050 --> 02:28:15.052
FOLLOW UP OR P. FOX AND THEY DO

02:28:15.119 --> 02:28:19.156
NOT TRANSFORM INTO PEOPLE ARE

02:28:19.223 --> 02:28:20.057
PEOPLE THE ENVIRONMENT. ON

02:28:20.124 --> 02:28:21.292
HUMAN PRODUCTS THE BILL WOULD

02:28:21.359 --> 02:28:23.227
BE PDF MEDICAL. THAT INCLUDE

02:28:23.294 --> 02:28:25.696
CLOCKS POLYMERS AND ARE ALREADY

02:28:25.763 --> 02:28:27.565
APPROVED BY FDA WHEN IN FACT

02:28:27.632 --> 02:28:30.835
FLUOROPOLYMERS HAVE BEEN USED

02:28:30.901 --> 02:28:31.435
SAFELY IN MEDICAL DEVICES FOR

02:28:31.502 --> 02:28:32.470
OVER THIRTY YEARS. THEY ARE

02:28:32.536 --> 02:28:34.238
PART OF OUR QUALITIES LIKE LIKE

02:28:34.305 --> 02:28:34.939
THAT THE LAST COULD BE

02:28:35.006 --> 02:28:36.574
INSTABILITY AND THEY'RE

02:28:36.641 --> 02:28:37.508
EXTREMELY LOW CHEMICAL

02:28:37.575 --> 02:28:39.277
REACTIVITY REDUCES THE BODY'S

02:28:39.343 --> 02:28:41.679
REACTION TO REJECT FOREIGN

02:28:41.746 --> 02:28:43.481
MATERIALS. THEY ALSO HELP

02:28:43.547 --> 02:28:45.116
PREVENT MICROORGANISMS FROM

02:28:45.182 --> 02:28:47.318
COLONIZING SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS

02:28:47.385 --> 02:28:49.453
STENTS CATHETERS MEDICAL

02:28:49.520 --> 02:28:51.455
FILTERS INTO BEING WHICH COULD

02:28:51.522 --> 02:28:53.291
POTENTIALLY LEAD TO INFECTIONS

02:28:53.357 --> 02:28:56.427
AND OTHER COMPLICATIONS- ALSO

02:28:56.494 --> 02:28:57.361
THE BILL WOULD BAN MANY

02:28:57.428 --> 02:28:59.230
JUVENILE ON A TONIC DEVICES

02:28:59.297 --> 02:29:00.564
WITH INSULATED WIRES PRINTED

02:29:00.631 --> 02:29:02.199
CIRCUIT BOARDS OR TOUCH SCREENS

02:29:02.266 --> 02:29:03.868
THINGS LIKE A CHILD'S LEARNING

02:29:03.934 --> 02:29:07.038
TOY A BABY MONITOR. A READING

02:29:07.104 --> 02:29:07.571
TABLET OR HANDHELD GAMING

02:29:07.638 --> 02:29:09.974
DEVICE- THERE USED IN THOSE

02:29:10.041 --> 02:29:11.208
DEVICES BECAUSE THEY ARE HIGHLY

02:29:11.275 --> 02:29:12.977
RESISTANT TO TEMPERATURE AND

02:29:13.044 --> 02:29:14.345
HAVE SUPERIOR OF LEXICAL

02:29:14.412 --> 02:29:17.615
PROPERTIES. AND TIME IS- UP TO

02:29:17.682 --> 02:29:19.583
PREVENT DAMAGE FROM MOISTURE.

02:29:19.650 --> 02:29:21.485
OKAY YOUR TIME IS UP AND YOU

02:29:21.552 --> 02:29:23.321
KNOW YOU REALLY HAVE TO LISTEN

02:29:23.387 --> 02:29:24.488
TO THE TESTIMONY YOU JUST CAN'T

02:29:24.555 --> 02:29:27.391
COME WITH A- SOMETHING YOU'VE

02:29:27.458 --> 02:29:29.026
MADE UP AHEAD OF TIME AND READ

02:29:29.093 --> 02:29:30.995
IT LISTEN TO THE TESTIMONY.

02:29:31.062 --> 02:29:32.797
THESE YOU SPENT TWO MINUTES

02:29:32.863 --> 02:29:34.965
TALKING ABOUT THINGS THAT THE

02:29:35.032 --> 02:29:37.001
OFFER IS ALREADY CONCEDED ON.

02:29:37.068 --> 02:29:39.103
I'VE HEARD ENOUGH AND YOU DID

02:29:39.170 --> 02:29:41.238
GO TO YOUR TWO MINUTES. BUT

02:29:41.305 --> 02:29:43.007
PLEASE LISTEN TO MY APOLOGIES-

02:29:43.074 --> 02:29:44.909
I WAS I WAS READING FOR THE

02:29:44.975 --> 02:29:46.277
BENEFIT OF THE OTHER COMMITTEE

02:29:46.344 --> 02:29:49.447
MEMBERS BUT I DIDN'T MEAN TO

02:29:49.513 --> 02:29:51.182
WHAT. TIME THE AUTHOR. THAT

02:29:51.248 --> 02:29:52.983
THEY WERE NOT INCLUDED THE

02:29:53.050 --> 02:29:54.752
COMMITTEE MEMBERS HEARD THIS

02:29:54.819 --> 02:29:55.720
YOU COULD HAVE AT LEAST

02:29:55.786 --> 02:29:57.121
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY WERE

02:29:57.188 --> 02:29:59.190
ALREADY EXCLUDED AND LEFT IT

02:29:59.256 --> 02:30:02.193
THERE AND GIVE US SOMETHING

02:30:02.259 --> 02:30:03.427
MORE SUBSTANTIAL. THANK YOU

02:30:03.494 --> 02:30:06.797
NOW- IS FAR AS THE DISCUSSION

02:30:06.864 --> 02:30:09.233
ABOUT- THE TSC AND GREEN

02:30:09.300 --> 02:30:11.569
CHEMISTRY TAKING THIS ON. THIS

02:30:11.635 --> 02:30:12.370
ISSUE FIRST CAME TO THE

02:30:12.436 --> 02:30:13.871
COMMITTEE FOR YEARS AGO THERE'S

02:30:13.938 --> 02:30:16.574
BEEN NO PROGRESS CENTS FOR

02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:18.075
YEARS IS FOUR YEARS TOO LONG.

02:30:18.142 --> 02:30:20.945
SECOND THE TSC SAID HAS SAID

02:30:21.011 --> 02:30:22.513
THAT ALL OF THESE CHEMICALS

02:30:22.580 --> 02:30:24.715
THAT WE TALK ABOUT THAT WOULD

02:30:24.782 --> 02:30:26.884
BE IN JUVENILE PRODUCTS. SHOULD

02:30:26.951 --> 02:30:28.452
BE TREATED AS A CLASS THAT'S

02:30:28.519 --> 02:30:29.787
SOMETHING WE DIDN'T KNOW FOUR

02:30:29.854 --> 02:30:31.055
YEARS AGO THERE WAS A BIG

02:30:31.122 --> 02:30:32.590
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE VARIOUS

02:30:32.656 --> 02:30:33.657
TYPES AND SHOULD THEY BE

02:30:33.724 --> 02:30:35.292
CONSIDERED DIFFERENTLY. THERE

02:30:35.359 --> 02:30:37.027
WAS NOT A CONSENSUS ON THAT

02:30:37.094 --> 02:30:39.263
THAT CONSENSUS HAS BEEN REACHED

02:30:39.330 --> 02:30:40.931
THEY SHOULD BE TREATED AS A

02:30:40.998 --> 02:30:47.037
CLASS. ALL RIGHT. ANY QUESTIONS.

02:30:47.104 --> 02:30:50.674
YES- CRISTINA GARCIA THANK YOU

02:30:50.741 --> 02:30:52.576
ADD JUST A SHORT COMMENT- WHEN

02:30:52.643 --> 02:30:53.477
I THINK THE UP THERE FOR

02:30:53.544 --> 02:30:56.680
WORKING ON THIS- ON THE P. FAST

02:30:56.747 --> 02:30:58.349
IN THE CLASS ISSUE WE KNOW THAT

02:30:58.416 --> 02:31:00.718
IS THE FIRST CHANGE BEHAVE MUCH

02:31:00.785 --> 02:31:01.318
LIKE THE LONG TEAMS AS THEY

02:31:01.385 --> 02:31:04.021
BREAK DOWN- AND SO WHEN WE DID

02:31:04.088 --> 02:31:06.390
AB SEVEN FIFTY SIX I WAS THERE

02:31:06.457 --> 02:31:07.691
TO TAKE THAT STEP FORWARD TO

02:31:07.758 --> 02:31:09.160
CALL THESE OF THE CLASS AND I

02:31:09.226 --> 02:31:10.694
THINK THE LESSON HERE IS THAT

02:31:10.761 --> 02:31:12.096
MY MOM WE DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING

02:31:12.163 --> 02:31:13.764
THAT IN THE FUTURE WE KNOW THAT

02:31:13.831 --> 02:31:14.732
THESE ARE PROBABLY GOING TO BE

02:31:14.799 --> 02:31:15.800
PROBLEMS AND SO WE SHOULD BE

02:31:15.866 --> 02:31:18.969
PROACTIVE AND SELF. THANK YOU

02:31:19.036 --> 02:31:24.208

SPECIFICALLY MAKE ME VERY

02:31:36.854 --> 02:31:38.189
FREAKED OUT OF THE MOTHER

02:31:38.255 --> 02:31:39.123
THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH WE CAN DO

02:31:39.190 --> 02:31:40.391
SO THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO HELP

02:31:40.458 --> 02:31:44.228
AND I GUESS THAT'S US. SO I

02:31:44.295 --> 02:31:46.230

IS. YEAH I STARTED ON THIS

02:31:49.633 --> 02:31:51.702
COMMITTEE TWO YEARS AGO REALLY

02:31:51.769 --> 02:31:52.703
EXCITED ABOUT THE GREEN

02:31:52.770 --> 02:31:54.438
CHEMISTRY DEPARTMENT AND THEIR

02:31:54.505 --> 02:31:56.807
WORK YOU KNOW I. WE ALSO AS

02:31:56.874 --> 02:31:57.875
PARENTS ABOUT EVERYTHING

02:31:57.942 --> 02:31:59.577
WITHOUT BPA BECAUSE WE KNEW BPA

02:31:59.643 --> 02:32:01.345
WAS BAD AND THEN WE LEARN. THE

02:32:01.412 --> 02:32:03.013
PS IS JUST AS BAD AND IT TURNS

02:32:03.080 --> 02:32:03.614
OUT WE'VE BEEN LETTING THEIR

02:32:03.681 --> 02:32:05.716
KIDS USE THAT. SO THERE IS I

02:32:05.783 --> 02:32:06.717
MEAN THE GREEN CHEMISTRY

02:32:06.784 --> 02:32:07.985
DIVISION IS REALLY IMPORTANT IN

02:32:08.052 --> 02:32:09.787
ENSURING WE DON'T MAKE THOSE

02:32:09.854 --> 02:32:11.322
MISTAKES OF CREATING ORE

02:32:11.388 --> 02:32:13.924
DANGEROUS ALTERNATIVES. BUT TO

02:32:13.991 --> 02:32:15.659
THE CHAIRS POINTS. THE GREEN

02:32:15.726 --> 02:32:16.894
CHEMISTRY DIVISION HAS BEEN

02:32:16.961 --> 02:32:18.696
AROUND FOR OVER A DECADE. AND

02:32:18.762 --> 02:32:21.465
BAD AND MADE THREE ROLES. RURAL

02:32:21.532 --> 02:32:23.467
SO CLEARLYTHEY'RE NOT MOVING

02:32:23.534 --> 02:32:24.368
FAST ENOUGH AND IT'S OUR

02:32:24.435 --> 02:32:25.836
OBLIGATION TO PROTECT.

02:32:25.903 --> 02:32:26.971
CALIFORNIANS WHERE THEY ARE

02:32:27.037 --> 02:32:28.939
FAILING SO WE STARTED OUR DAY

02:32:29.006 --> 02:32:31.175
WORKING ON DTS YOU'RE GOING TO

02:32:31.242 --> 02:32:31.675

02:32:33.010 --> 02:32:35.246
LIKE TO UNDERSTAND WHY I MEAN A

02:32:35.312 --> 02:32:36.514
LOT OF TIME WAS SPENT IN THE

02:32:36.580 --> 02:32:39.083
OPPOSITION. TALKING ABOUT THE

02:32:39.149 --> 02:32:40.684
PRODUCTS THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY

02:32:40.751 --> 02:32:42.720
CONCEDED YOU WILL EMANATE SO WE

02:32:42.786 --> 02:32:43.621
DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT

02:32:43.687 --> 02:32:44.555
MEDICAL DEVICES THAT I THINK

02:32:44.622 --> 02:32:46.257
ALL OF US. THINK MEDICAL

02:32:46.323 --> 02:32:48.526
DEVICES. GREEN AUTHOR SHOULD BE

02:32:48.592 --> 02:32:51.495
AVAILABLE- SO FOR THE REMAINING

02:32:51.562 --> 02:32:52.930
PRODUCTS THE CLOTHING THE

02:32:52.997 --> 02:32:54.098
BASSINETS THE THINGS ARE

02:32:54.164 --> 02:32:57.768
PUTTING OUR. CHILDREN AND WHY

02:32:57.835 --> 02:32:58.369
ARE THESE EVEN IN THAT. WELL I

02:32:58.435 --> 02:32:59.603
WOULD THEY SHOULDN'T BE OKAY

02:32:59.670 --> 02:33:01.272
FULL STOP. BUT THEY TYPICALLY

02:33:01.338 --> 02:33:02.907
PUT IN AS A STAIN RESISTANT

02:33:02.973 --> 02:33:03.941
DEVICES SIMILAR TO WHAT WHY

02:33:04.008 --> 02:33:05.843
THEY USE TOUGH ON- STANDS COME

02:33:05.910 --> 02:33:08.145
OFF EASIER SO. THE MANUFACTURER

02:33:08.212 --> 02:33:09.213
SAYS I HAVE DECIDED THAT FOR

02:33:09.280 --> 02:33:10.381
THAT CONVENIENCE YOU WERE

02:33:10.447 --> 02:33:11.482
WILLING TO RISK THE HEALTH OF

02:33:11.549 --> 02:33:13.017
YOUR CHILD. AND I WOULD CONTEND

02:33:13.083 --> 02:33:13.951
THAT IF WE SHOWED PARENTS THE

02:33:14.018 --> 02:33:15.586
EVIDENCE OF THE PUMP CHEMICALS

02:33:15.653 --> 02:33:17.221
THAT THEY'RE EVEN OUR THIS

02:33:17.288 --> 02:33:18.489
ARRAY OF CHEMICALS ON THESE

02:33:18.556 --> 02:33:19.823
PRODUCTS. THE BE HORRIFIED THAT

02:33:19.890 --> 02:33:21.392
WE ALLOW IT I HAD NO IDEA THAT

02:33:21.458 --> 02:33:22.960
THESE WERE ALLOWED. YOU GOT A

02:33:23.027 --> 02:33:24.261
BABY CHEWING ON THE SIDE OF THE

02:33:24.328 --> 02:33:25.396
BASSINET THERE CHEWING ON KEY

02:33:25.462 --> 02:33:26.931
FOSS THAT WAS PUT THERE JUST SO

02:33:26.997 --> 02:33:28.699
YOU COULD WIPE IT. CLEAN A

02:33:28.766 --> 02:33:29.600
LITTLE BIT EASIER I TAKE THE

02:33:29.667 --> 02:33:32.570
SAME. OVER THE TOXIC EXPOSURE

02:33:32.636 --> 02:33:34.238
ANY DAY OF THE WEEK. THANK YOU

02:33:34.305 --> 02:33:35.773
YES AND I THINK THAT'S A REALLY

02:33:35.839 --> 02:33:36.373
IMPORTANT POINT TO MAKE WHICH

02:33:36.440 --> 02:33:38.475
IS. MY KIDS CLOTHES WERE ALWAYS

02:33:38.542 --> 02:33:40.978
ST STE NO MATTER WHAT THEY'RE

02:33:41.045 --> 02:33:41.745
PUTTING ON THEM. I'LL TAKE THE

02:33:41.812 --> 02:33:44.048
STAND- BUT YOU KNOW WE- IT'S

02:33:44.114 --> 02:33:45.583
JUST INCOME AND I'M HONESTLY WE

02:33:45.649 --> 02:33:47.084
DON'T REPLACE IT. WITH AN AD

02:33:47.151 --> 02:33:48.419
THE OTHER DANGEROUS ALTERNATIVE

02:33:48.485 --> 02:33:50.020
BECAUSE THAT IS ALWAYS MY FEAR

02:33:50.087 --> 02:33:51.221
IN THESE BILLS BUT- OBVIOUSLY I

02:33:51.288 --> 02:33:53.657
THINK THIS IS CRITICAL WORK AND

02:33:53.724 --> 02:33:55.225

03:21:05.253 --> 03:21:08.423
CERTAINLY. WILLING TO WORK ON

03:21:08.489 --> 03:21:11.025
THAT DATE- AND PROBABLY COME TO

03:21:11.092 --> 03:21:12.960
A REAL AGREEMENT ON IT WHAT

03:21:13.027 --> 03:21:14.328
WE'RE TRYING TO DO THOUGH IS

03:21:14.395 --> 03:21:16.497
ENSURE THAT THERE'S LABELING-

03:21:16.564 --> 03:21:17.832
THAT IS ESTABLISHED SO THAT'S

03:21:17.899 --> 03:21:19.834
EASILY UNDERSTOOD TERMS OF THE

03:21:19.901 --> 03:21:21.602
NATURE OF THE PRODUCT. AND THAT

03:21:21.669 --> 03:21:23.171
BE DONE FOR THE LOWER LEACHING

03:21:23.237 --> 03:21:24.038
PRODUCTS SO I THINK WE CAN SORT

03:21:24.105 --> 03:21:26.107
OF GET THEIR- BUT WE HAVEN'T

03:21:26.174 --> 03:21:27.408
GOT THERE COMPLETELY UP WITH

03:21:27.475 --> 03:21:29.243
THE LABELING ISSUE FOR PUTTING

03:21:29.310 --> 03:21:30.611
IT OUT THERE SOONER THAN LATER

03:21:30.678 --> 03:21:32.280
I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT

03:21:32.346 --> 03:21:33.881
BECAUSE PUBLIC DOLLARS. ARE

03:21:33.948 --> 03:21:35.983
CURRENTLY BEING SPENT- FOR

03:21:36.050 --> 03:21:36.951
PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND CHILDCARE

03:21:37.018 --> 03:21:38.619
CENTRES AND THEY'RE OUT THERE

03:21:38.686 --> 03:21:40.254
BUYING THE PRODUCT AND JUST

03:21:40.321 --> 03:21:42.457
MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S- CLEAR

03:21:42.523 --> 03:21:44.392
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE'RE

03:21:44.459 --> 03:21:45.092
DEALING WITH IN THE LABELING

03:21:45.159 --> 03:21:46.961
THAT. THAT THERE I THINK

03:21:47.028 --> 03:21:48.763
REFERRING TO IS VERY HARD TO

03:21:48.830 --> 03:21:50.998
UNDERSTAND A VERY HARD TO. DRAW

03:21:51.065 --> 03:21:52.900
THE CONCLUSION OF WHAT THAT IS-

03:21:52.967 --> 03:21:55.102
CLEARLY REFERENCING SO WE ARE

03:21:55.169 --> 03:21:57.338
CERTAINLY OPEN TO MOVING BACK

03:21:57.405 --> 03:21:58.306
TO THE TWENTY FOUR DATE BUT WE

03:21:58.372 --> 03:22:00.208
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE GET

03:22:00.274 --> 03:22:01.476
THE PROPER LABELING OUT SOONER

03:22:01.542 --> 03:22:04.612

PRODUCTIVE USE. THIS IS A TAX

03:40:08.762 --> 03:40:13.199

THESE PROGRAMS HUNDRED DS-

03:40:25.612 --> 03:40:29.416
UNDER DGSE- THE ONLY WAY TO DO

03:40:29.482 --> 03:40:31.484
IT IS TO RAISE A TAX. SOEONE

03:40:31.551 --> 03:40:33.286

03:41:48.194 --> 03:41:49.763
DISCUSSED IN THE COMMITTEE

03:41:49.829 --> 03:41:53.433
ANALYSIS WHERE. THE GOVERNOR.

03:41:53.500 --> 03:41:57.137
IS PROPOSING. A MAJOR REFORM TO

03:41:57.203 --> 03:41:59.673
THE FEE STRUCTURE ALSO- WHICH

03:41:59.739 --> 03:42:01.341
INCLUDES THE CHANGES TO THE

03:42:01.408 --> 03:42:04.144
ENVIRONMENTAL THREE. AND- THE

03:42:04.210 --> 03:42:08.415
PROPOSAL. PERMANENTLY

03:42:08.481 --> 03:42:10.550
ELIMINATES A FEE FOR BUSINESSES

03:42:10.617 --> 03:42:12.619
WITH LAWSON HUNDRED EMPLOYEES.

03:42:12.686 --> 03:42:13.987
I GUESS THIRD DEFINITION OF

03:42:14.054 --> 03:42:16.189

03:42:16.256 --> 03:42:18.358
FEE FOR BUSINESSES WITH THE

03:42:18.425 --> 03:42:18.958
HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED NINETY

03:42:22.362 --> 03:42:23.930
HUNDRED MORE EMPLOYEES WHICH I

03:42:23.997 --> 03:42:27.767
THINK IT'S BEEN. IF NOT THE

03:42:27.834 --> 03:42:29.936
TRYING TO LEASE TO. THIRD

03:42:30.003 --> 03:42:31.938
THERE'S BEEN GREATER CALLS FOR.

03:42:32.005 --> 03:42:34.074
YOU KNOW LARGE CORPORATIONS IN

03:42:34.140 --> 03:42:35.642
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO PAY

03:42:35.709 --> 03:42:39.546
OFF. THEIR FAIR SHARE- AND TO

03:42:39.612 --> 03:42:41.614
TRY TO HELP OUR SMALL

03:42:41.681 --> 03:42:43.883
BUSINESSES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE-

03:42:43.950 --> 03:42:45.385
SO GIVEN THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

03:42:45.452 --> 03:42:48.088
PROPOSED IN THIS- WHY SHOULD I

03:42:48.154 --> 03:42:49.489
SUPPORT YOUR BILL. GOOD

03:42:49.556 --> 03:42:54.561
QUESTION THE ANSWER IS- I THAT

03:42:54.627 --> 03:42:58.064
FIRST OF ALL IF WE DO IT- IF WE

03:42:58.131 --> 03:42:59.265
DO THAT THE FEE BECOMES MUCH

03:42:59.332 --> 03:43:00.967
LARGER APPROACH MY STAFF HAS

03:43:01.034 --> 03:43:02.435
THE EXACT NUMBER BUT THE FEE

03:43:02.502 --> 03:43:04.170
BECOMES MUCH LARGER ON THE

03:43:04.237 --> 03:43:06.272
BIGGER COMPANIES. IF IT'S A

03:43:06.339 --> 03:43:08.274
CONSENSUS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT

03:43:08.341 --> 03:43:09.109
THEY PREFERRED THE GOVERNOR'S

03:43:09.175 --> 03:43:11.945
APPROACH- I'M PERFECTLY HAPPY

03:43:12.011 --> 03:43:13.179
TO DO THAT AND ONE OF THE

03:43:13.246 --> 03:43:15.215
REASONS WE'RE DOING THIS. IS

03:43:15.281 --> 03:43:17.884
THAT WHILE YOU CAN SAYTHAT

03:43:17.951 --> 03:43:20.553
THIS IS A TAX IT IS BUT IT'S

03:43:20.620 --> 03:43:22.522
ALSO POLICY CONSIDERATIONS BOTH

03:43:22.589 --> 03:43:25.158
IN TERMS OF. WHO PAYS AS WELL

03:43:25.225 --> 03:43:28.328
AS- HOW THE MONEY IS USED IN

03:43:28.394 --> 03:43:31.030
THIS IS A WORTHWHILE- USE OF

03:43:31.097 --> 03:43:33.299
THE MONEY AND THAT WHAT I WANT

03:43:33.366 --> 03:43:35.335
TO FIND FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

03:43:35.401 --> 03:43:36.669
IS DO THEY FEEL THIS IS A

03:43:36.736 --> 03:43:39.339
WORTHWHILE USE- WOULD THEY

03:43:39.405 --> 03:43:41.241
PREFER THE GOVERNOR'S APPROACH.

03:43:41.307 --> 03:43:42.742
AND THEN FINALLY IS THERE

03:43:42.809 --> 03:43:44.410
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THEY

03:43:44.477 --> 03:43:46.312
NEED TO ASSURE THE MONEY IS

03:43:46.379 --> 03:43:48.948
BEING USED PROPERLY. WE HEARD

03:43:49.015 --> 03:43:54.621
EARLIER FROM THE- SECRETARY AND

03:43:54.687 --> 03:43:57.157
THE DEPARTMENT HAD- THAT THEY

03:43:57.223 --> 03:43:59.993
ARE GOING TO HAVE METRICS AND

03:44:00.059 --> 03:44:03.630
OTHER THINGS. MY QUESTION FOR-

03:44:03.696 --> 03:44:06.466
THE COMMITTEE IS- ARE YOU READY

03:44:06.533 --> 03:44:08.034
TO SUPPORT THAT YOU NEED TO GET

03:44:08.101 --> 03:44:09.769
MORE INFORMATION FIRST LIKE

03:44:09.836 --> 03:44:11.871
WHAT THE METRICS WOULD BE. BUT

03:44:11.938 --> 03:44:12.906
THAT'S THE REASON FOR BRINGING

03:44:12.972 --> 03:44:15.441
THIS FORTH NOW AND I'D LIKE TO

03:44:15.508 --> 03:44:16.176
KNOW YOUR OPINION AND YOU

03:44:16.242 --> 03:44:19.445
CLEARLY SEEM TO PREFER AT THE

03:44:19.512 --> 03:44:21.481
GOVERNOR'S APPROACH AND- I'D

03:44:21.548 --> 03:44:23.216
LIKE TO HEAR FROM OTHER MEMBERS

03:44:23.283 --> 03:44:24.818
AS WELL- DO YOU FEEL

03:44:24.884 --> 03:44:27.220
COMFORTABLE WITH THE- BILL

03:44:27.287 --> 03:44:31.357
OTHERWISE. WELL I THINK- WE

03:44:31.424 --> 03:44:34.294
ALL. APPRECIATE HAVING GOT. A

03:44:34.360 --> 03:44:36.696
LEGISLATIVE VEHICLE TO ENSURE

03:44:36.763 --> 03:44:38.765
THAT TO. THAT WE CAN HAVE

03:44:38.832 --> 03:44:42.135
THESE- NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE

03:44:42.202 --> 03:44:43.770
LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S

03:44:43.837 --> 03:44:46.706
OFFICE- BUT IN THIS CASE IT

03:44:46.773 --> 03:44:47.974
SEEMS LIKE OUR LEGISLATIVE

03:44:48.041 --> 03:44:48.741
VEHICLE WOULD BE THE BUDGET

03:44:48.808 --> 03:44:54.147
BILL- AND SO I- I WOULD PREFER

03:44:54.214 --> 03:44:57.116
THAT- WE FOCUS THAT-

THIS COMMITTEE FEEL LIKE

03:46:04.083 --> 03:46:05.785
CURRENTLY THAT'S NOT. THE CASE

03:46:05.852 --> 03:46:07.053
THE DGSE AND SO THROWING MORE

03:46:07.120 --> 03:46:08.955
MONEY AT AN AGENCY THAT WE

03:46:09.022 --> 03:46:11.557
DON'T BELIEVE IS ADEQUATELY

03:46:11.624 --> 03:46:13.927
PERFORMING FEELS. THE BEST

03:46:13.993 --> 03:46:16.596
CHOICE NECESSARILY- BUT I ALSO

03:46:16.663 --> 03:46:18.932
HEAR WHAT THE AGENCY SAID IN

03:46:18.998 --> 03:46:20.566
THEIR NEED FOR MORE RESOURCES

03:46:20.633 --> 03:46:22.535
TO DO THE JOB. AND THAT YOU

03:46:22.602 --> 03:46:24.003
KNOW HAVING NOT READ THE SEASON

03:46:24.070 --> 03:46:25.538
DECADES THAT THAT'S AN INTEGRAL

03:46:25.605 --> 03:46:26.940
PART OF ENSURING THAT THIS THE

03:46:27.006 --> 03:46:30.243
AGENCY IS FUNCTIONING. BUT I.

03:46:30.310 --> 03:46:31.778
SHARE WHAT YOU JUST SAID ABOUT

03:46:31.844 --> 03:46:32.645
WANTING TO HEAR FROM US ABOUT

03:46:32.712 --> 03:46:34.280
WHAT IT IS WE NEED. AND I

03:46:34.347 --> 03:46:35.581
APPRECIATE WHAT THE SECRETARY

03:46:35.648 --> 03:46:37.050
SAID BUT IN MY QUESTION TO THE

03:46:37.116 --> 03:46:38.518
ADMINISTRATION I ASKED WHAT ARE

03:46:38.584 --> 03:46:40.286
THE SPECIFIC METRICS HOW ARE

03:46:40.353 --> 03:46:42.088
YOU GOING TO SHOW US. THAT IF

03:46:42.155 --> 03:46:43.156
WE GIVE YOU THIS MONEY YOU ARE

03:46:43.222 --> 03:46:44.657
PERFORMING IN YES EVERY TIME

03:46:44.724 --> 03:46:46.059
THERE IS IF YOU HAVE TO COME

03:46:46.125 --> 03:46:47.026
BACK BUT THE FIRST TIME WE

03:46:47.093 --> 03:46:48.962
RAISE THAT FEE WE'RE DOING IT

03:46:49.028 --> 03:46:50.363
SOMEWHAT IN BLIND FAITH THAT

03:46:50.430 --> 03:46:52.098
THIS IS GONNA. THAT THEY WILL

03:46:52.165 --> 03:46:53.599
START PERFORMING AND DOING THE

03:46:53.666 --> 03:46:54.934
WORK THAT BUSINESSES NEED THEM

03:46:55.001 --> 03:46:57.070
TO DO AND TO THE POINT THAT A

03:46:57.136 --> 03:46:59.172
FAMILY MEMBER GARCIA MADE. YOU

03:46:59.238 --> 03:47:00.406
KNOW IF SOMEBODY HASN'T GOTTEN

03:47:00.473 --> 03:47:02.342
THEIR PERMITS SINCE NINETEEN

03:47:02.408 --> 03:47:03.042
EIGHTY FIVE THEY CAN'T OPERATE

03:47:03.109 --> 03:47:04.077
IN THE WAY THEY WANT TO OPERATE

03:47:04.143 --> 03:47:05.178
SO THERE IS INCENTIVES TO THE

03:47:05.244 --> 03:47:06.879
BUSINESSES TO ONE DGSE TO WORK

03:47:06.946 --> 03:47:09.549

03:47:09.615 --> 03:47:11.751
JOB IF THE CHASSIS IS- HELPING

03:47:11.818 --> 03:47:13.386
THEM DO IT SO. I SEE THE

03:47:13.453 --> 03:47:15.054
BENEFIT OF IT BUT I THINK THAT

03:47:15.121 --> 03:47:16.289
WHAT I REALLY NEED IS TO

03:47:16.356 --> 03:47:18.691
UNDERSTAND WHAT METRICS ARE IN

03:47:18.758 --> 03:47:21.160
PLACE. WHEN WE'RE GOING TO SEE

03:47:21.227 --> 03:47:22.528
THEM I WANT TO SEE YOU KNOW THE

03:47:22.595 --> 03:47:24.630
SECRETARY SPOKE EARLIER ABOUT A

03:47:24.697 --> 03:47:26.366

HAVE YET TO BE CLEANED UP OKAY.

03:47:28.134 --> 03:47:30.003
ARE WE GOING TO SEE. TEN

03:47:30.069 --> 03:47:31.104

PERFORMANCE THAT WE'RE GOING TO

03:47:36.409 --> 03:47:37.944
HAVE THOSE METRICS. AND I THINK

03:47:38.011 --> 03:47:39.012
THAT'S THE KEY TO FEELING

03:47:39.078 --> 03:47:40.046
COMFORTABLE GIVING THEM

03:47:40.113 --> 03:47:41.748
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IS KNOWING

METRICS THAT THEY WILL BE

03:47:43.583 --> 03:47:45.251
FORCED TO PERFORM THEM. AND

03:47:45.318 --> 03:47:45.885
THAT WE ARE GOING TO HOLD THEM

03:47:45.952 --> 03:47:47.754
ACCOUNTABLE OKAY SO WHAT I WILL

03:47:47.820 --> 03:47:50.656
OFFER IS FOR MEMBERS OF THE

03:47:50.723 --> 03:47:51.424

DISCUSSION OF METRICS AND OTHER

03:47:59.699 --> 03:48:00.266
THINGS THAT WILL GIVE THE

03:48:00.333 --> 03:48:05.471
COMMITTEE MEMBERS- CONFIDENCE.

03:48:05.538 --> 03:48:06.239
AND OF COURSE WE ALSO THE FACT

03:48:06.305 --> 03:48:09.409
THAT THEY NOW. A BOARD. AND THE

03:48:09.475 --> 03:48:11.544
EXTENT TO WHICH YOU FEEL THAT

03:48:11.611 --> 03:48:12.145
THAT ALSO WOULD INCREASE YOUR

03:48:12.211 --> 03:48:19.886
CONFIDENCE. CAN I ASK TO THAT.

03:48:19.952 --> 03:48:21.954
PART OF THE PROBLEM WAS AND

03:48:22.021 --> 03:48:23.923
WORK THEY HAVE TO DO AND HOW

03:48:23.990 --> 03:48:24.690
THEY HAVE BEEN USING THE

03:48:24.757 --> 03:48:26.125
DOLLARS AND SO THE WORK LOAD

03:48:26.192 --> 03:48:27.493
ANALYSIS THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED

03:48:27.560 --> 03:48:29.629
TO US ACTUALLY GIVES US A RANGE

03:48:29.695 --> 03:48:30.496
WHERE IT TALKS ABOUT WHAT

03:48:30.563 --> 03:48:31.798
HAPPENS IF WE HAVE THIS AMOUNT

03:48:31.864 --> 03:48:33.433
OF MONEY WHAT CAN WE DO AND HOW

03:48:33.499 --> 03:48:34.434
QUICKLY CAN WE GET TO THE

03:48:34.500 --> 03:48:36.436
SITES- AND THE RANGES ANYWHERE

03:48:36.502 --> 03:48:39.038
FROM YOU KNOW TEN YEARS TO A

03:48:39.105 --> 03:48:40.073
HUNDRED YEARS DEPENDING AT THE

03:48:40.139 --> 03:48:41.207
PACE THAT WILL WORKING AND- AT

03:48:41.274 --> 03:48:42.341
THE CURRENT PACE AT WHICH WE'RE

03:48:42.408 --> 03:48:43.609
GOING TO SUCCEED TO BE HUNDRED

03:48:43.676 --> 03:48:45.111
TWO YEARS- THAT THOSE ARE GOING

03:48:45.178 --> 03:48:46.813
TO CONTINUE TO LIVE- AND THIS

03:48:46.879 --> 03:48:48.781
POLLUTION SO. I DO THINK THAT

03:48:48.848 --> 03:48:49.882
THERE'S MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO

03:48:49.949 --> 03:48:51.084
BE DONE AND THAT IN ITSELF DOES

03:48:51.150 --> 03:48:52.385
NOT GIVE US THE ASSURANCES THAT

03:48:52.452 --> 03:48:54.187
WE NEED- ANYTHING GIVEN THE

03:48:54.253 --> 03:48:56.489
HISTORY OF THE AGENCY IT'S HARD

03:48:56.556 --> 03:48:58.424
TO SAY HERE'S SOME MONEY- BUT I

03:48:58.491 --> 03:48:59.759
THINK THAT THIS IS WHERE WE ARE

03:48:59.826 --> 03:49:01.561
WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION

03:49:01.627 --> 03:49:02.061
TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE

03:49:02.128 --> 03:49:03.029
GOVERNANCE REFORMS THE

03:49:03.096 --> 03:49:05.131
ACCOUNTABILITY. THE ROLE OF THE

03:49:05.198 --> 03:49:06.833
BORDERS I THINK WELL THERE'S AN

03:49:06.899 --> 03:49:07.733
AGREEMENT ON THE BOARD THE ROLE

03:49:07.800 --> 03:49:09.102
OF THE BOARD TO HAVE THAT

03:49:09.168 --> 03:49:10.570
ACCOUNTABILITY ARE YOU STILL

03:49:10.636 --> 03:49:11.971
DETAILS THAT ARE BEING

03:49:12.038 --> 03:49:14.474
DISCUSSED AND SO AS WE DO THE

03:49:14.540 --> 03:49:16.209
WORK IT'S BEEN CLEAR TO WAS

03:49:16.275 --> 03:49:19.912
THAT IS NOT. ONE WITHOUT THE

03:49:19.979 --> 03:49:21.380

SEE AT THE VERY END. AND IT'S

03:49:38.231 --> 03:49:40.066
