01:06:41.764 --> 01:06:45.301 region:rollup2
HALF WOULD COME OUT OF HIGHER

01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:47.504 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AND K. TWELVE.

01:06:45.301 --> 01:06:50.173 region:rollup2
I'M WONDERING IF YOU WOULD BE

01:06:47.504 --> 01:06:51.441 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN AT AS PART OF THE

01:06:50.173 --> 01:06:52.542 region:rollup2
SPELL TO COME UP WITH THE

01:06:51.441 --> 01:06:55.612 region:rollup2
REPLACEMENT FOR THE MONEY WE'RE

01:06:52.542 --> 01:06:57.347 region:rollup2
LOSING.

01:06:55.612 --> 01:06:58.681 region:rollup2
WELL I I THINK YOU FOR THAT

01:06:57.347 --> 01:07:00.316 region:rollup2
QUESTION NOW DOCTOR CLERK I WILL

01:06:58.681 --> 01:07:01.618 region:rollup2
JUST A BRIEF CORRECTION SO

01:07:00.316 --> 01:07:02.318 region:rollup2
TWENTY SEVEN BILLION THAT IS OUT

01:07:01.618 --> 01:07:04.721 region:rollup2
AND EIGHTEEN MONTH PER

01:07:02.318 --> 01:07:06.155 region:rollup2
PROJECTIONS SO I AN ANNUALIZED.

01:07:04.721 --> 01:07:07.423 region:rollup2
LEVEL REVENUE LOSS WOULD BE MORE

01:07:06.155 --> 01:07:08.858 region:rollup2
ON THE ORDER OF EIGHTEEN BILLION

01:07:07.423 --> 01:07:09.626 region:rollup2
AT LEAST INITIALLY WHICH MIGHT

01:07:08.858 --> 01:07:11.227 region:rollup2
SOUND LIKE A LOT.

01:07:09.626 --> 01:07:12.996 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY.

01:07:11.227 --> 01:07:14.697 region:rollup2
WOULD ONLY BRING US BACK ABOUT

01:07:12.996 --> 01:07:15.298 region:rollup2
TWO YEARS TO WHAT THE STATE

01:07:14.697 --> 01:07:16.499 region:rollup2
BUDGET WAS TWO YEARS AGO. AND

01:07:15.298 --> 01:07:17.700 region:rollup2
SO.

01:07:16.499 --> 01:07:19.335 region:rollup2
I THINK A PRETTY GOOD

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:20.270 region:rollup2
METHODOLOGY.

01:07:19.335 --> 01:07:21.371 region:rollup2
FOR HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT WOULD

01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:22.839 region:rollup2
BE TO LET'S LOOK AT.

01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:24.274 region:rollup2
WHAT THE MAIN COST DRIVERS HAVE

01:07:22.839 --> 01:07:26.442 region:rollup2
BEEN OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS

01:07:24.274 --> 01:07:28.645 region:rollup2
IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO WHEN

01:07:26.442 --> 01:07:29.279 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR BROWN?

01:07:28.645 --> 01:07:29.879 region:rollup2
FIRST TOOK OFFICE I THINK THE

01:07:29.279 --> 01:07:30.513 region:rollup2
BUDGET'S GONE SOMETHING LIKE

01:07:29.879 --> 01:07:32.015 region:rollup2
SIXTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS SINCE

01:07:30.513 --> 01:07:32.782 region:rollup2
THEN. AND LET'S LOOK AT TACK ON

01:07:32.015 --> 01:07:34.117 region:rollup2
A WHAT WE'VE GOTTEN IN RETURN

01:07:32.782 --> 01:07:34.617 region:rollup2
FOR THAT SPENDING OUR THEIR

01:07:34.117 --> 01:07:36.719 region:rollup2
MEASURABLE.

01:07:34.617 --> 01:07:37.921 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT IN LIFE OUTCOMES

01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:39.088 region:rollup2
FOR CALIFORNIANS AND HERDS OF

01:07:37.921 --> 01:07:40.223 region:rollup2
HEALTH OUTCOMES AND HEARD OF

01:07:39.088 --> 01:07:42.225 region:rollup2
EDUCATION OUTCOMES.

01:07:40.223 --> 01:07:44.160 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF THAT AT YOU KNOW

01:07:42.225 --> 01:07:45.795 region:rollup2
INCOME LEVEL OR PURCHASING POWER

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:46.829 region:rollup2
AND WE DON'T SEE ANY

01:07:45.795 --> 01:07:48.164 region:rollup2
IMMEASURABLE.

01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:48.998 region:rollup2
IMPROVE AND OUT COMES A LINK TO

01:07:48.164 --> 01:07:50.466 region:rollup2
THE INCREASE SPENDING.

01:07:48.998 --> 01:07:51.501 region:rollup2
THEN WE CAN REMOVE THAT

01:07:50.466 --> 01:07:53.603 region:rollup2
SPENDING AND I THINK TO BE VERY

01:07:51.501 --> 01:07:54.837 region:rollup2
EASY TO ACTUALLY I GO BACK JUST

01:07:53.603 --> 01:07:57.707 region:rollup2
TO AGAIN WHERE WE WERE AT. AYE

01:07:54.837 --> 01:08:00.944 region:rollup2
TWO YEARS AGO NOW I WILL SAY

01:07:57.707 --> 01:08:03.346 region:rollup2
THAT IF YOU KNOW COSTS ARE

01:08:00.944 --> 01:08:06.382 region:rollup2
CONCERNED HAS YOU.

01:08:03.346 --> 01:08:08.785 region:rollup2
ACCURATELY NOTE THIS WILL HAVE

01:08:06.382 --> 01:08:11.321 region:rollup2
MORE HURDLES TO GO THROUGH IN

01:08:08.785 --> 01:08:12.288 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND OF

01:08:11.321 --> 01:08:16.292 region:rollup2
COURSE ALL THIS CAN BE

01:08:12.288 --> 01:08:19.829 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATED US SO I THINK YOU CAN

01:08:16.292 --> 01:08:23.866 region:rollup2
CONSIDER TODAY'S BELL. I SIMPLY

01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:26.302 region:rollup2
A VOTE TO ENDORSE THE PRINCIPLE

01:08:23.866 --> 01:08:29.839 region:rollup2
I THAT WE SHOULD HAVE

01:08:26.302 --> 01:08:31.808 region:rollup2
DEDUCTIBILITY WHICH I THINK BOTH

01:08:29.839 --> 01:08:36.279 region:rollup2
SIDES OF THE AISLE.

01:08:31.808 --> 01:08:38.948 region:rollup2
SEEM TO AGREE ON THAT I YOU

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:41.551 region:rollup2
KNOW IF YOU BELIEVE THAT THE

01:08:38.948 --> 01:09:24.060 region:rollup2
SAME ARE YOUR TOTAL INCOME

01:08:41.551 --> 01:09:30.066 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T BE.

01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:49.352 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY.

01:09:30.066 --> 01:09:54.323 region:rollup2
MISTER KILEY THIS WAS IN FACT

01:09:49.352 --> 01:09:57.293 region:rollup2
ADOPTED ORIGINALLY TO PROTECT

01:09:54.323 --> 01:09:57.827 region:rollup2

01:09:57.293 --> 01:10:02.165 region:rollup2
ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES AND I

01:09:57.827 --> 01:10:05.802 region:rollup2
DON'T.

01:10:02.165 --> 01:10:08.738 region:rollup2
JUST JUST SEEMS A CONTRARY TO

01:10:05.802 --> 01:10:09.372 region:rollup2
THAT I'D I'D BE CURIOUS TO HEAR

01:10:08.738 --> 01:10:22.385 region:rollup2
YOUR RESPONSE BATES RIGHT SINGLE

01:10:09.372 --> 01:10:24.053 region:rollup2
ARE

01:10:22.385 --> 01:10:27.156 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ACTUALLY THIS IS A

01:10:24.053 --> 01:10:30.093 region:rollup2
GREAT EXAMPLE OF FEDERALISM IS

01:10:27.156 --> 01:10:32.328 region:rollup2
THAT SOME STATES ARE LIKE THE

01:10:30.093 --> 01:10:33.896 region:rollup2
ONES I LISTED OUT WERE AGAIN

01:10:32.328 --> 01:10:37.467 region:rollup2

AND IT'S WITHIN THE THE POWER OF

01:10:45.775 --> 01:10:48.811 region:rollup2
EACH STATE TO DECIDE THEIR

01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:50.713 region:rollup2
APPROACH AND I'M SAYING THAT WE

01:10:48.811 --> 01:10:52.281 region:rollup2
SHOULD JOIN THESE OTHER STATES

01:10:50.713 --> 01:10:54.350 region:rollup2
IN ANDTAKING THE APPROACH OF

01:10:52.281 --> 01:10:59.956 region:rollup2
ALLOWING. FEDERAL TAXES TO BE

01:10:54.350 --> 01:11:04.627 region:rollup2

THAT CREATING STABILITY THE WAY

WHEN I THINK A FOR SOFT MR

ACOSTA FOR BRINGING THIS

01:28:27.002 --> 01:28:30.505 region:rollup2
MEASURE.

01:28:28.103 --> 01:28:32.507 region:rollup2
FORWARD. AS HE SAID THE

UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR PEOPLE IN

01:28:34.075 --> 01:28:36.578 region:rollup2
EIGHTY PERCENT I.

01:28:35.544 --> 01:28:38.046 region:rollup2
I WAS THINK ABOUT THIS IN

01:28:36.578 --> 01:28:39.381 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CONTEXT WHICH IS IF WE

01:28:38.046 --> 01:28:41.283 region:rollup2
COULD THINK OF ANY OTHER.

01:28:39.381 --> 01:28:42.651 region:rollup2
POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA THAT

01:28:41.283 --> 01:28:44.586 region:rollup2
HAD THAT KIND OF UNEMPLOYMENT

01:28:42.651 --> 01:28:46.121 region:rollup2
RATE WHAT WOULD WE DO AND.

01:28:44.586 --> 01:28:46.788 region:rollup2

THIS BILL IN THE PROBABLY BLOW

01:28:46.788 --> 01:28:49.958 region:rollup2
RIGHT OFF. WE HAVE SOME KIND OF

01:28:48.456 --> 01:28:51.459 region:rollup2
RESPONSE.

01:28:49.958 --> 01:28:52.661 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WE PASSED

01:28:51.459 --> 01:28:53.829 region:rollup2
A VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE IN

01:28:52.661 --> 01:28:56.064 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:28:53.829 --> 01:28:57.599 region:rollup2
WHICH CALL FOR EMPLOYMENT FIRST

01:28:56.064 --> 01:28:58.800 region:rollup2
POLICY FOR THIS POPULATION IN

01:28:57.599 --> 01:29:00.001 region:rollup2
OTHER WORDS THE VERY FIRST THING

01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:01.937 region:rollup2
THAT WE LOOK AT.

01:29:00.001 --> 01:29:03.338 region:rollup2
FOR ANYBODY IN IS POPULATION IS

01:29:01.937 --> 01:29:04.873 region:rollup2
A JOB IN TRYING TO HELP THEM GET

01:29:03.338 --> 01:29:06.808 region:rollup2
TO WORK YET WE STILL HAVE THAT

01:29:04.873 --> 01:29:08.343 region:rollup2
EIGHTY PERCENT. OF PLUS

01:29:06.808 --> 01:29:10.078 region:rollup2
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE.

01:29:08.343 --> 01:29:11.012 region:rollup2
THERE IS SOME CONTROVERSY

01:29:10.078 --> 01:29:14.282 region:rollup2
AROUND.

01:29:11.012 --> 01:29:16.017 region:rollup2
THE USE OF SUB MINIMUM WAGE FOR

01:29:14.282 --> 01:29:17.485 region:rollup2
THIS POPULATION.

01:29:16.017 --> 01:29:19.487 region:rollup2
AS THE SORT OF PHILOSOPHICAL

01:29:17.485 --> 01:29:20.689 region:rollup2
DIVIDE GOING ON RIGHT NOW AMONG

01:29:19.487 --> 01:29:22.490 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT SERVE THIS

01:29:20.689 --> 01:29:24.259 region:rollup2
POPULATION SOME BELIEVE THAT WE

01:29:22.490 --> 01:29:27.062 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T HAVE THAT ALL. OTHERS

01:29:24.259 --> 01:29:28.163 region:rollup2
HAVE SEEN VERY CORRECTLY I THINK

01:29:27.062 --> 01:29:28.730 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL

01:29:28.163 --> 01:29:30.699 region:rollup2
TO HELP SOME PEOPLE GET INTO

01:29:28.730 --> 01:29:33.235 region:rollup2
THE.

01:29:30.699 --> 01:29:34.569 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE AND AT THE SAME TIME.

01:29:33.235 --> 01:29:36.438 region:rollup2
GIVES EMPLOYERS.

01:29:34.569 --> 01:29:37.372 region:rollup2
THE VALUE THEY NEED WHEN

01:29:36.438 --> 01:29:39.507 region:rollup2
THEY'RE SORT OF AYE WAITING

01:29:37.372 --> 01:29:40.575 region:rollup2
THERE BOTTOM LINE THIS BILL KIND

01:29:39.507 --> 01:29:42.310 region:rollup2
OF MARY'S.

01:29:40.575 --> 01:29:43.778 region:rollup2
BOTH CONCEPTS VERY CAREFULLY. BY

01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:46.414 region:rollup2
BASICALLY SAYING THAT ALL YEAR

01:29:43.778 --> 01:29:47.916 region:rollup2
LONG IF AN EMPLOYER DECIDES TO

01:29:46.414 --> 01:29:50.318 region:rollup2
PAY A PERSON WHO WAS ELIGIBLE

01:29:47.916 --> 01:29:52.020 region:rollup2
FOR SUB MINIMUM WAGE.

01:29:50.318 --> 01:29:53.622 region:rollup2
AT LEAST MINIMUM WAGE THEY

01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:55.790 region:rollup2
COULD ENJOY AT THE END OF THE

01:29:53.622 --> 01:29:57.392 region:rollup2
YEAR A TAX CREDIT FOR PUTTING

01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:58.693 region:rollup2
THAT PERSON WORK. WHAT'S ALSO

01:29:57.392 --> 01:30:01.329 region:rollup2
INTERESTING ABOUT THE FEDERAL

01:29:58.693 --> 01:30:02.998 region:rollup2
LAW AND FOURTEEN SEE IS THAT.

01:30:01.329 --> 01:30:05.667 region:rollup2
PEOPLE EMPLOYED UNDER THE US GET

01:30:02.998 --> 01:30:07.602 region:rollup2
REEVALUATED EVERY SIX MONTHS

01:30:05.667 --> 01:30:09.104 region:rollup2
MOST OF US YOU GUYS EVER. I

01:30:07.602 --> 01:30:10.872 region:rollup2
GUESS IN EVERY TO YOUR REVIEW BY

01:30:09.104 --> 01:30:12.474 region:rollup2
YOUR VOTERS MOST PEOPLE HAVE AN

01:30:10.872 --> 01:30:14.342 region:rollup2
ANNUAL REVIEW WITH A LOOK AT BY

01:30:12.474 --> 01:30:14.976 region:rollup2
THEIR EMPLOYER WE LOOK AT

01:30:14.342 --> 01:30:15.410 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT THEY DID A GOOD

01:30:14.976 --> 01:30:17.145 region:rollup2
JOB.

01:30:15.410 --> 01:30:18.613 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT DOT.

01:30:17.145 --> 01:30:21.549 region:rollup2
DESPITE RELATION GETS IN EVERY

01:30:18.613 --> 01:30:23.385 region:rollup2
SIX MONTHS MANDATORY REVIEW SO.

01:30:21.549 --> 01:30:24.986 region:rollup2
IF THEY'RE FOUND DURING THAT

01:30:23.385 --> 01:30:26.855 region:rollup2
TIME TO GET BETTER AT THEIR JOB.

01:30:24.986 --> 01:30:28.356 region:rollup2
THEN THEIR WAGE GOES UP UNDER

01:30:26.855 --> 01:30:29.958 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL LAW MEETING THIS TAX

01:30:28.356 --> 01:30:31.426 region:rollup2
CREDIT WOULD GO DOWN.

01:30:29.958 --> 01:30:33.295 region:rollup2
SO WHICH IS IDEAL.

01:30:31.426 --> 01:30:34.296 region:rollup2
THE COUPLE THINGS WE'VE DONE

01:30:33.295 --> 01:30:35.931 region:rollup2
HERE WE'VE SUNSET AT THIS TO

01:30:34.296 --> 01:30:37.165 region:rollup2
REQUIRE THAT ONLY GOES FOR A

01:30:35.931 --> 01:30:38.566 region:rollup2
TIME LIMITED PERIOD.

01:30:37.165 --> 01:30:40.235 region:rollup2
AND THEN REQUIRES A REPORT BACK

01:30:38.566 --> 01:30:42.070 region:rollup2
TO THE LEGISLATURE SO WE CAN SEE

01:30:40.235 --> 01:30:43.838 region:rollup2
HOW WELL THIS WORK. I CONTINUE

01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:46.608 region:rollup2
FIRSTHAND WE HAVE TALKED TO MANY

01:30:43.838 --> 01:30:48.376 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER GROUPS THE RESTAURANTS.

01:30:46.608 --> 01:30:51.413 region:rollup2
THE GROCER'S CAL CHAMBER.

01:30:48.376 --> 01:30:52.747 region:rollup2
ARE ALL LIKE THIS CONCEPT. IT'S

01:30:51.413 --> 01:30:54.249 region:rollup2
EASY FOR THEM AND THAT IS VERY

01:30:52.747 --> 01:30:55.950 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT IN ORDER TO GET OUR

01:30:54.249 --> 01:30:57.052 region:rollup2
POPULATION WORKING WITH THEM BUT

01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:58.653 region:rollup2
THE SUPPORTS THAT MR ACOSTA

01:30:57.052 --> 01:31:00.221 region:rollup2
DESCRIBED.

01:30:58.653 --> 01:31:02.757 region:rollup2
IN ELECTORATE DRIVE VOTE THANK

01:31:00.221 --> 01:31:03.325 region:rollup2
YOU VERY MUCH.

01:31:02.757 --> 01:31:06.227 region:rollup2
THINK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN

01:31:03.325 --> 01:31:08.363 region:rollup2
SPORT.

01:31:06.227 --> 01:31:08.930 region:rollup2
TRUTH ANDERSON WITH ARKIN UCP

01:31:08.363 --> 01:31:12.367 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA COLLABORATION AND

01:31:08.930 --> 01:31:13.535 region:rollup2
SUPPORT.

01:31:12.367 --> 01:31:14.903 region:rollup2
GOOD AFTERNOON VERY JUTTING FROM

01:31:13.535 --> 01:31:15.403 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA DISABILITY

01:31:14.903 --> 01:31:17.439 region:rollup2
SERVICES ASSOCIATION AND

01:31:15.403 --> 01:31:19.607 region:rollup2
SUPPORT.

01:31:17.439 --> 01:31:21.476 region:rollup2
WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION.

01:31:19.607 --> 01:31:22.510 region:rollup2
SEEN ON QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS

01:31:21.476 --> 01:31:24.679 region:rollup2
FROM THE COMMITTEE DUCK CREEK.

01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:26.748 region:rollup2
ARM.

01:31:24.679 --> 01:31:27.582 region:rollup2
SO MY CONCERN IS.

01:31:26.748 --> 01:31:29.684 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TEN MILLION

01:31:27.582 --> 01:31:32.487 region:rollup2
DOLLARS ONCE THE PROGRAM GETS

01:31:29.684 --> 01:31:34.155 region:rollup2
STARTED. AND ESSENTIALLY WHY

01:31:32.487 --> 01:31:35.490 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T A GROCER.

01:31:34.155 --> 01:31:36.958 region:rollup2
GIVE THE PERSON THE FULL MINIMUM

01:31:35.490 --> 01:31:37.459 region:rollup2
WAGE WHEN THE STATE'S PAYING A

01:31:36.958 --> 01:31:39.027 region:rollup2
HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE

01:31:37.459 --> 01:31:39.527 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE.

01:31:39.027 --> 01:31:40.495 region:rollup2
I WOULD THINK THAT WHAT

01:31:39.527 --> 01:31:42.263 region:rollup2
HAPPENED.

01:31:40.495 --> 01:31:43.631 region:rollup2
AND YOU GET TO THAT TEN MILLION

01:31:42.263 --> 01:31:45.734 region:rollup2
DOLLAR DIFFERENCE.

01:31:43.631 --> 01:31:47.769 region:rollup2
MY CONCERN THOUGH IS THAT WE'RE

01:31:45.734 --> 01:31:48.837 region:rollup2
REALLY TALKING ABOUT IS.

01:31:47.769 --> 01:31:51.306 region:rollup2
AS WAS BROUGHT UP BY YOUR

01:31:48.837 --> 01:31:53.108 region:rollup2
SUPPORTER. IS THE.

01:31:51.306 --> 01:31:54.843 region:rollup2
EIGHTY PERCENT.

01:31:53.108 --> 01:31:56.044 region:rollup2
AND SO FAR AS I CAN SEE THIS

01:31:54.843 --> 01:31:57.779 region:rollup2
DOES NOTHING FOR THE EIGHTY

01:31:56.044 --> 01:31:58.713 region:rollup2
PERCENT WHO ARE EMPLOYED IT

01:31:57.779 --> 01:32:00.148 region:rollup2
GIVES MORE MONEY TO PEOPLE WHO

01:31:58.713 --> 01:32:01.649 region:rollup2
ARE THAT'S

01:32:00.148 --> 01:32:02.817 region:rollup2
IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. BUT

01:32:01.649 --> 01:32:04.986 region:rollup2
I JUST DON'T THINK THIS IS THE

01:32:02.817 --> 01:32:05.787 region:rollup2
BEST WAY TO SPEND THE MONEY SO I

01:32:04.986 --> 01:32:07.722 region:rollup2
WON'T BE SUPPORTING IT.

01:32:05.787 --> 01:32:10.258 region:rollup2
I.

01:32:07.722 --> 01:32:12.727 region:rollup2
I APOLOGIZE BUT. THAT'S THAT IS

01:32:10.258 --> 01:32:14.662 region:rollup2
MY VIEWPOINT.

01:32:12.727 --> 01:32:16.164 region:rollup2
WELL I APPRECIATE THE THE THE

01:32:14.662 --> 01:32:17.665 region:rollup2
COMMENTARY THERE I THINK WHAT

01:32:16.164 --> 01:32:20.335 region:rollup2
WE'VE HEARD AND I LET MY OF THE

01:32:17.665 --> 01:32:22.137 region:rollup2
SPONSOR ACTUALLY RESPOND AS WELL

01:32:20.335 --> 01:32:24.472 region:rollup2
IF IF THAT THE CHAIRS INDULGENCE

01:32:22.137 --> 01:32:26.408 region:rollup2
BUT. VERY BRIEFLY OF WHAT I'VE

01:32:24.472 --> 01:32:28.343 region:rollup2
HEARD FROM A COMMUNITY MEMBERS

01:32:26.408 --> 01:32:30.345 region:rollup2
AND EMPLOYERS IS THAT.

01:32:28.343 --> 01:32:32.881 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD LIKE TO HIRE EITHER

01:32:30.345 --> 01:32:34.482 region:rollup2
A MORE OR BE ANYONE FROM THIS

01:32:32.881 --> 01:32:35.784 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY IF THEY CAN GET THE

01:32:34.482 --> 01:32:37.819 region:rollup2
PENCIL OUT AND GIVEN THE

01:32:35.784 --> 01:32:38.486 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS WHERE. WE HAVE

01:32:37.819 --> 01:32:40.488 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES.

01:32:38.486 --> 01:32:42.090 region:rollup2
WITH EMPLOYMENT IN THIS AREA

01:32:40.488 --> 01:32:43.658 region:rollup2
ARENA EIGHTY PERCENT.

01:32:42.090 --> 01:32:45.026 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAYBE THE

01:32:43.658 --> 01:32:45.894 region:rollup2
TWENTY PERCENT YOUR CONCERN IS A

01:32:45.026 --> 01:32:46.461 region:rollup2
TWENTY PERCENT GETTING MORE

01:32:45.894 --> 01:32:49.130 region:rollup2
MONEY.

01:32:46.461 --> 01:32:51.633 region:rollup2
BUT THEY'RE THERE THIS IS STILL

01:32:49.130 --> 01:32:52.901 region:rollup2
A RELATIVELY SMALL POPULATION SO

01:32:51.633 --> 01:32:54.636 region:rollup2
THE EIGHTY PERCENT SHOULD BE

01:32:52.901 --> 01:32:55.804 region:rollup2
ABLE TO BE VERY EASILY ADDRESSED

01:32:54.636 --> 01:32:57.305 region:rollup2
FROM WHAT I'M SEEING OUT IN THE

01:32:55.804 --> 01:32:58.907 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES THAT WE HAVE SEVERAL

01:32:57.305 --> 01:33:02.177 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS IN AND NOW MY DISTRICT

01:32:58.907 --> 01:33:03.645 region:rollup2
THAT HIGHER ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY

01:33:02.177 --> 01:33:04.712 region:rollup2
THIS POPULATION. SO IT'S NOT SO

01:33:03.645 --> 01:33:05.713 region:rollup2
SO MUCH DIRECTED IN THEIR

01:33:04.712 --> 01:33:07.315 region:rollup2
DIRECTION IT'S MORE DIRECTED IN

01:33:05.713 --> 01:33:08.650 region:rollup2
THE DIRECTION OF THE RESTAURANTS

01:33:07.315 --> 01:33:10.518 region:rollup2
THE GROCERS THE OTHER FOLKS THAT

01:33:08.650 --> 01:33:12.053 region:rollup2
COULD. THAT COULD GET THESE

01:33:10.518 --> 01:33:13.321 region:rollup2
FOLKS SAN AND HAVE A PENCIL OUT

01:33:12.053 --> 01:33:14.389 region:rollup2
AND THEN BE ABLE TO GET THEM TO

01:33:13.321 --> 01:33:15.924 region:rollup2
A POINT WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO

01:33:14.389 --> 01:33:23.064 region:rollup2
BE MORE PRODUCTIVE AND THEY'RE

01:33:15.924 --> 01:33:23.731 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE LEANING LESS ON

01:33:23.064 --> 01:33:24.666 region:rollup2
SOCIETY AND MORE ON THEM.

01:33:23.731 --> 01:33:26.401 region:rollup2
FOR THE EMPLOYER TO MAKE THAT

01:33:24.666 --> 01:33:27.435 region:rollup2
LEAP OF FAITH

01:33:26.401 --> 01:33:31.973 region:rollup2
AND NOT EVERYBODY WOULD LOVE

01:33:27.435 --> 01:33:33.441 region:rollup2
EVERYONE FRANKLY TO MAKE THAT

01:33:31.973 --> 01:33:35.143 region:rollup2
LEAP OF FAITH.

01:33:33.441 --> 01:33:36.878 region:rollup2
THE UNKNOWN OFTENTIMES WE FOR

01:33:35.143 --> 01:33:38.413 region:rollup2
THAT IN THIS BUILDING IN AND AND

01:33:36.878 --> 01:33:39.881 region:rollup2
ON THE FLOOR OF OUR CHAMBER.

01:33:38.413 --> 01:33:41.082 region:rollup2
AND THE FEAR THE UNKNOWN

01:33:39.881 --> 01:33:43.051 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES CAN BE A STE A

01:33:41.082 --> 01:33:44.652 region:rollup2
ROADBLOCK AND HINDRANCE FOR THE

01:33:43.051 --> 01:33:46.020 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER AND IF WE CAN TAKE AWAY

01:33:44.652 --> 01:33:47.322 region:rollup2
ONE MORE BARRIER TO ENTRY FOR

01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:49.057 region:rollup2
THIS EIGHTY PERCENT OF THIS

01:33:47.322 --> 01:33:49.991 region:rollup2
POPULATION. HEADING IT'S THE

01:33:49.057 --> 01:33:52.827 region:rollup2

THESE ANGEL INVESTORS THERE'S

ONE OTHER PART OF AN ANGEL

01:47:26.407 --> 01:47:29.243 region:rollup2
INVESTOR AND I DON'T THINK IS

01:47:27.875 --> 01:47:30.577 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED.

01:47:29.243 --> 01:47:32.046 region:rollup2
WHEN THE BELL LOW MAYBE I'VE

01:47:30.577 --> 01:47:33.981 region:rollup2
MISSED SOMETHING WHICH IS.

01:47:32.046 --> 01:47:36.517 region:rollup2
GENERALLY SPEAKING IT IS THOUGHT

01:47:33.981 --> 01:47:38.319 region:rollup2
THAT ANGEL INVESTORS ARE TAKING

01:47:36.517 --> 01:47:40.821 region:rollup2
ANY KIND OF MONEY OUT OF THE

01:47:38.319 --> 01:47:42.156 region:rollup2
COMPANY. AND WHAT THEY HAVE TO

01:47:40.821 --> 01:47:44.024 region:rollup2
PAY THEM IS THE EIGHT HUNDRED

01:47:42.156 --> 01:47:44.458 region:rollup2
DOLLAR MINIMUM AND I ACTUALLY

01:47:44.024 --> 01:47:46.694 region:rollup2
HAD THE BILL. WHICH.

01:47:44.458 --> 01:47:48.329 region:rollup2
.

01:47:46.694 --> 01:47:49.763 region:rollup2
I BASICALLY COULDN'T GET A GOOD

01:47:48.329 --> 01:47:52.466 region:rollup2
DEFINITION FOR SO IT WAS.

01:47:49.763 --> 01:47:53.801 region:rollup2
JOINTLY WITH THE ALLEN WHICH

01:47:52.466 --> 01:47:55.602 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE SAID FOR AN ANGEL

01:47:53.801 --> 01:47:56.804 region:rollup2
INVESTOR YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY

01:47:55.602 --> 01:47:58.605 region:rollup2
THAT EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS.

01:47:56.804 --> 01:48:00.074 region:rollup2
SO ANYWAY MY CONCERN HERE IS

01:47:58.605 --> 01:48:01.942 region:rollup2
PERHAPS YOU WANT TO CHANGE IT

01:48:00.074 --> 01:48:03.811 region:rollup2
FROM ANGEL INVESTOR TO SOMETHING

01:48:01.942 --> 01:48:05.746 region:rollup2
ELSE BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE. COULD

01:48:03.811 --> 01:48:07.548 region:rollup2
IF I'M UNLESS I'M READING THE

01:48:05.746 --> 01:48:08.882 region:rollup2
BILL WRONG WHICH I MIGHT BE.

01:48:07.548 --> 01:48:10.351 region:rollup2
THESE PEOPLE COULD BE MAKING A

01:48:08.882 --> 01:48:12.353 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONEY FROM

01:48:10.351 --> 01:48:14.321 region:rollup2
THEIR INVESTMENT.

01:48:12.353 --> 01:48:15.422 region:rollup2
AND.

01:48:14.321 --> 01:48:16.190 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT OUR HOPE IS

01:48:15.422 --> 01:48:18.092 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE MAKING A

01:48:16.190 --> 01:48:19.493 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONEY I IN

01:48:18.092 --> 01:48:20.994 region:rollup2
IN THEIR INVESTMENT AT SOME

01:48:19.493 --> 01:48:22.763 region:rollup2
POINT I THINK OUR REAL CONCERN

01:48:20.994 --> 01:48:24.498 region:rollup2
HERE IS THAT AND WE WILL. CHECK

01:48:22.763 --> 01:48:26.066 region:rollup2
AND SEE IF ANGEL INVESTOR IS THE

01:48:24.498 --> 01:48:27.134 region:rollup2
PROPER TERM TO BE USED HOWEVER I

01:48:26.066 --> 01:48:27.568 region:rollup2
BELIEVE IT IS.

01:48:27.134 --> 01:48:31.372 region:rollup2

DOLLARS FROM SECURE CAPITAL. AND

01:48:39.179 --> 01:48:41.815 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY JUST TRYING

01:48:40.047 --> 01:48:43.951 region:rollup2
TO DO HERE IS MAKE SWORE THAT
