I BELIEVE THAT'S ITEM NUMBER FIVE SO. IF YOU LIKE IT'S SITUATED AND YOU MAY PROCEED. I THINK WE SHOULD GO I'M SORRY I'M SO WE STILL ARE DOING IT THAT HAS A SUBCOMMITTEE BY THE WAY GREAT THANK YOU AND I WILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIRMAN CHAO AND. AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY TWO WHICH DEALS WITH ONLINE DATA PRIVACY. ACCORDING TO STATISTICS FROM THE NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION IN THE PEW RESEARCH CENTER. SEVENTY FOUR POINT SIX PERCENT OF THE UNITED STATES POPULATION UTILIZES THE INTERNET AND SIXTY NINE PERCENT INTERACTS WITH ONE. OR MORE FORMS OF SOCIAL MEDIA. THE INFALLIBLE AMOUNTS OF PERSONAL DATA PRODUCED ON THE INTERNET. MEANS THAT REGULATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO SAFEGUARD CONSUMERS THEIR PRIVACY AND DATA ON THE INTERNET. I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE REFERENCE IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S TWENTY SIXTEEN REPORT WHICH FOUND THAT IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS. NEARLY FIFTY MILLION RECORDS OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN BREACHED AND THE MAJORITY OF THESE PREACHERS RESULTED FROM SECURITY FAILURES. FURTHERMORE THE REPORT NOTED THAT IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT ORGANIZATIONS EMPLOYEE STRONG PRIVACY PRACTICES TO PROTECT PRIVACY. BUSINESSES MUST HAVE PRIVACY POLICIES THAT ARE EASY TO READ AND ACCESS INFORM CONSUMERS ABOUT MATERIAL CHANGES TO THEIR DATA HANDLING PRACTICES. AND CAREFULLY SELECT THERE DID DEFAULT SETTINGS WHICH OFTEN DETERMINE HOW DATA IS COLLECTED USED AND SHARED. TO FILL SO TO FACILITATE THIS EFFORT I AM PROPOSING TO NARROW THIS BILL. TO HAVE THE DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITY OFFER ASSISTANCE TO CONSUMERS IN NAVIGATING HOW TO CONTROL THE USE SHARING AND PROTECTION OF THEIR DATA AT THE OUTSET. WE LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN THIS EFFORT WITH ME TODAY TO VOICE SUPPORT IN CONCEPT FOR THE BILL. IS MIKE SHAPIRO THE CHIEF PRIVACY OFFICER FOR SANTA CLARA COUNTY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELCOME IN THE YOU MADE A PROCEED. GREAT THANK YOU AGAIN MIKE SHAPIRO CHIEF PRIVACY OFFICER THE COUNTY SANTA CLARA I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY. I'M I THINK IT'S INTERESTING AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN SAYING. RECENTLY I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE. OUR CONSTITUENTS BOTH WITHIN THE COUNTY AS WELL AS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YOUR HAVE NOTICED THAT THERE'S A BIT OF AN UP TICK IN DATA BREACHES. WHETHER THEY'RE JUST NOTICING THAT BECAUSE IT'S BEING REPORTED ON OUR BECAUSE THIS VERY TO THE REACHES OF SO MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT. I THINK IT IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US IS WHETHER WERE GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES ELECTED OFFICIALS TO TAKE A LOT OF ACTION. I. ACTUALLY REACHED OUT TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE TO DISCUSS ARE HIS PROPOSAL AND. THERE'S INTERESTING. TO ACTUALLY HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH HIM AND THEN TO KIND OF LEARN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DIRECTION WANTED TO TAKE IT. I THINK THAT AS A PRIVACY PROFESSIONAL MYSELF WE DO NEED TO CONSIDER BOUNCING THE BUSINESS INTERESTS WITH THE PRIVACY INTERESTS OF THE PUBLIC. I FEEL THAT OFTENTIMES ONE OF THE OTHER CAN TAKE A LOOK AT A PRECEDENCE I THINK DRIVING AT THAT BALANCE IS NOT SOMETHING WE CAN IT ANY LONGER AVOID. I THINK WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT PRIVACY AND I THINK WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE IS PROPOSING IS SOMETHING. REASONABLE STEPANEK RIGHT DIRECTION. WHAT I THINK WE CAN'T DO CONSIDERING THE SEVERITY OF THE DATA BREACHES WHETHER IT'S WITH FACEBOOK CAMBER TELEMATICA? OR WHETHER IT'S WITH EXPERIENCE SOME OF THE OTHERS THAT WE'VE SEEN RECENTLY. BUT I DON'T THINK WE CAN DO IS I DON'T THINK WE COULD SAY WE UNDERSTAND WE KNOW ABOUT THESE BREACHES. WITH MATT WE DISCUSSED IT AND YET WE DECIDE TO DO NOTHING. SO I WOULD ASK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING A REASONABLE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE COULD TAKE TO ACTUALLY TAKE CONSUMERS AND OUR CONSTITUENTS PRIVACY INTO CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL PLEASE. COME FORWARD AND IDENTIFY YOURSELF IF. I DON'T SEE ANY. HUBBELL OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THINK YOU. MY NAME IS SARAH BOOT I'M HERE TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE TODAY. I'M I WANT TO START OUT BY SAYING THAT FOR THE RECORD WE ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO THE BILL THAT IS IN PRINT. BUT. THE AUTHORS OFFICE HAS REACHED OUT TO US NUMEROUS TIMES TO DISCUSS THE BILL AND THEY THEY DID PRESENT US WITH THIS NEW CONCEPT AYE IN ADVANCE OF TODAY'S HEARING IN SO. WANT THANK MISTER LEVINE FOR THAT IS WONDERFUL STAFF REALLY APPRECIATE IT. ALTHOUGH WE HAVEN'T SEEN LANGUAGE YET THE CONCEPT THAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED I'M CERTAINLY SEEMS REASONABLE OBVIOUSLY PROVIDING MORE RESOURCES TO CONSUMERS WHENEVER POSSIBLE IS A GREAT THING. DOT WITHOUT SAID. WE DO RESERVE THE RIGHT TO DETERMINE OUR POSITION ON THE NEW CONCEPT ONCE WE HAVE THE LANGUAGE IN FRONT OF US. WE CERTAINLY WILL BE WILLING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON THIS BILL. BUT WILL HAVE QUESTIONS OBVIOUSLY. AS TO HOW THIS NEW ENTITY WILL BE SET UP IN THE SCOPE OF ITS RESPONSIBILITIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE KEVIN MCKINLEY WITH INTERNET ASSOCIATION. WANTED TO THINK AUTHOR FOR THE DIRECTIONS TAKEN THE BILL WE THINK IT'S A POSITIVE STEP. THESE ARE ISSUES THAT OUR MEMBER COMPANIES TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY. AND WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO EMPOWER CONSUMERS TO USE THE TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TODAY. WE DO HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS WILL DEVELOPING BE IMPLEMENTED. AND SO WILL WORK WITH AUTHOR GOING FORWARD ON THOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF ADDITIONAL WITNESSES SO IN OPPOSITION. ONTO THIS BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD. LIKE. YOUR NAME IN THE ORGANIZATIONS ARE YOU REPRESENT. I'VE MARKET FUSSY ABOUT HALF CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION I LET MYSELF FOR THE REMARKS OF THE TWO PREVIOUS TEST FIRES AND APPRECIATE THAT AUTHOR'S. OTHER DIRECTIONS TAKE HIS BILL THANK YOU MATCH A NICE PLACE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISS CHURCH DOESN'T FAZE ON BEHALF OF TECHNO LIKE TWO LINER COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF THE PRESENTERS AS WELL THEY KICK YOU. MATCH. NEXT PLACE. GOOD AFTERNOON DANIEL CANDOR BECAUSE OUR ON BEHALF OF THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION I WOULD ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH THE PREVIOUS TESTIMONIES AS WELL THANK YOU. HOCKEY MATCH. OTHER ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SCENE NINE LET'S COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE COMMENTS QUESTIONS FROM THE PANEL. MR. I SURE KILEY CHO HAD PLEASE NEGATIVE FOR MR LEVINE. ACT COULD JUST ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE ON WHAT THE NEW VERSION OF THE BILL IS GOING TO DO. SO AS I STATED I'M NARROWING THE BILL TO HAVE THAT DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITY OFFER ASSISTANCE TO CONSUMERS IN NAVIGATING HOW TO CONTROL THE USE SHARING AND PROTECTION OF THEIR DATA. OUT AT THE OUTSET I THINK THE POINT THAT TODD THAT THE WITNESSES HAVE MADE. THIS AFTERNOON. IS THAT WE HAVE REALLY BEGUN A CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS CONCEPT AND AS A LAWMAKER I'M GRATEFUL TO HAVE STAKEHOLDERS TO WORK WITH US TO CRAFT. OF WHAT THIS WILL DO TO PART PROTECT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. AND SO THE NEW. WE'RE STILL GONNA HAVE THIS NEW ENTITY THE CALIFORNIA DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITY. I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS WORKS VERY WELL FOR CONSUMERS BUT ALSO. I THINK FROM THE PERSPECTIVE THAT ALL OF US SHARE CAN REDUCE ANY COSTS. TO THE STATE AS WELL AND SO WERE WERE FLEXIBLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WILL MAKE THIS WORK. OKAY THANK YEAH SEEMS LIKE MAYBE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT AN EXISTING REGULATED TO DO. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THAT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WHICH IS QUITE DETAILED IT TALKS ABOUT ENFORCEMENT AGENCY CALLED OPP. IN THE DOJ WHICH WAS DE FUNDED IT AND IT WAS RELIC RELATIVE TO ENFORCEMENT. AND IF IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT'S WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT. THIS ISN'T ABOUT ENFORCEMENT THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES MANY OF WHICH ARE LAWS THAT WE'VE PASSED ARE UNDERSTANDABLE AND AVAILABLE. TO. CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS AS WELL AS. INTEREST RIGHT HOW TO PROTECT ONE'S PRIVACY ONLINE. ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE. SEEN AN ARM. I. LIKE CERTAIN PARTS OF THE BILL ARE IT AS IT'S A CURRENTLY PRINTED. FOR EXAMPLE THE PART THAT WOULD PROVIDE MORE CONSUMER PROTECTION ALL YET I THINK THERE ARE PARTS OF THE BILL THAT MAY BE REDUNDANT EXAMPLE A CERTAIN PARTS OF THE BILL. MAY ALREADY BE BEEN COVERED BY A ON THE CURRENT LAW FOR EXAMPLE CHINA CHINA CHINA LIKE LAW WHICH COVERS A LOT OF THE POLICY ISSUE. BUT UNDERSTANDING THAT DIE YOU ARE GOING WITH THIS NEW CONCEPT HIGHLY STUCK SO ARE AMONG SUPPORT IT ARE SO THAT YOU WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO BASICALLY A FINE TUNED OUT CONCEPT AND HOPEFULLY. YOU KNOW YOU COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT ZEL MILLER RD TELL AND NOT ACCEPTABLE SO I'LL. AS SOON AS WE HAVE QUORUM THEN WE COULD WE COULD DO THAT BUT I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO CLOSE. SINCE THERE ARE NO GOOD FOR THE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS YOUR RESEARCH I WANNA SAY THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP FOR YOUR STAFF'S TIME ON THIS AS WELL TO ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT PROVIDED FEEDBACK. TO ME ON THIS AS I BEGAN DRAFTING THIS LEGISLATION LAST YEAR I HAD NOT ANTICIPATED THE UPROAR THAT. WE RECEIVED AFTER. THE DISCOVERY OF THE CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICAL FACEBOOK ISSUE BUT THAT'S JUST ONE ISSUE AND I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT FOR US AS THE LEGISLATURE TO. LOOK AT IT FROM A BIGGER PICTURE PERSPECTIVE AND THINK LONGER TERM THAN JUST ONE OUT ONE THING THAT THAT. FLARED OUT AND HAVE A HOLISTIC APPROACH XIN INCREMENTALLY. THIS IS ONE WAY FOR US TO ADDRESS THIS AND BE RESPONSIVE TO OUR CONSTITUENTS SO THANK YOU SO MUCH COMMITTEE FOR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. SO WE STILL DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM SO. BUT WE DO HAVE AUTHORS. WITH US IN THE LET'S SEE GO DOWN THE LIST I THINK THE NEXT ERA PRESENTER IS SOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER SIGN OFF. AND HE HAS ITEM NUMBER ONE THAT'S AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY ONE A WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BURSTS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY ONE WHICH WILL PREVENT BUSINESS OWNERS PERSONAL AND SENSITIVE INFORMATION FROM BEING EASILY ACCESSIBLE ONLINE. TODAY'S STATEMENTS OF INFORMATION FILED BY CORPORATIONS AND LLC'S CAN BE VIEWED ONLINE BY ANY INDIVIDUAL WITH INTERNET ACCESS. ALTHOUGH ALLOWING THE PUBLIC TO REVIEW THESE BUSINESS FILINGS ONLINE DOES IMPROVE GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY AND EFFICIENCY. SOME OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED OF THESE FINDINGS CAN BE USED. MISS YOU SUBSTANTIALLY. THE PERSONAL SIGNATURES PROVIDED ON THE FINAL IT'S CAN QUICKLY BE PULLED FROM THE DOCUMENT AND USED APPROXIMATELY SIGN OTHER DOCUMENTS INCLUDING CHEQUES. THE RESIDENTIAL ADDRESSES PROVIDED BY SOME BUSINESS OWNERS CAN USE TO FIND IMAGES AND THE EXACT LOCATION OF AN OWNER'S PERSONAL HOME. AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY ONE WOULD PROVIDE A MODEST SOLUTION BY REDACTING RESIDENTIAL ADDRESSES AND PERSONAL SIGNATURES FROM ALL FUTURE BUSINESS FILINGS POSTED ON THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S ONLINE DATABASE. ADDITIONALLY THE FULL UNALTERED PILINGS WOULD STILL BE AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST THIS BILL STRIKE THE PERFECT BALANCE BETWEEN PROTECTING BUSINESS OWNERS PERSONAL INFORMATION AND PROVIDING NECESSARY DISCLOSURE TO THE PUBLIC. I LIKE TO JUST POINT OUT I'M I WENT ONLINE AND PULLED. THIS FOR A BUSINESS CALLED FAR SITE STUDIOS THAT WAS FILED IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. AND WITH THAT INFORMATION I WAS ABLE TO GET A PHOTO OF THE OWNER'S HOME. AND THEN THIS OWNERS EXTREMELY GENEROUS TO THE GIRL SCOUTS OF AMERICA. AND ITS DECIDED TO GIVE A CHECK FOR A MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S A WHOLE LOT OF COOKIES MISTER OBERNOLTE YOU'RE VERY KIND AND GENEROUS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK OUR SERIBU TO TESTIFY AS WELL PLEASE SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON OUTSIDE MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AGAIN SARAH BOOT WITH THAT CALTRAIN FOR. I'LL BE BRIEF AYE MR STEINORTH ALREADY COVERED THE KEY POINTS OF THIS MODEST BUT COMMON SENSE BILL. THE CHAMBER SUPPORTS AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY ONE BECAUSE IT STRIKES A BALANCE BETWEEN PROTECTING THE SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF BUSINESS OWNERS WHILE STILL ENSURING THAT THE PUBLIC CONTINUES TO HAVE FULL ACCESS TO BUSINESS FILINGS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. CNN OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ALL KINDS. GO AHEAD FIRST OVER. A SETTLEMENT STEINORTH I I ACTUALLY THINK THIS IS A GREAT BILL IT'S MUCH NEEDED. AND. HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT I I HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR YOU MAYBE I JUST KIND OF SUGGESTIONS SO I AS YOU POINTED OUT. THE. CURRENT PRACTICE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE IS JUST TO SCAN. THE FORMS THAT ARE SUBMITTED FOR THEIR APPROVAL SO I'M WONDERING WHAT THEIR NEW SUGGESTED PROTOCOL IS GOING TO BE ARE THEY. GOING TO HAVE TO REDACT EVERY FORM THAT IS PRESENTED TO THEM. YES THE IDEAS PRESS TO HAVE THEM REDACT THE HOME ADDRESS AND ALSO THE SIGNATURE NOW IT'S BEEN BOMBED PROPOSED AS WELL THAT BUSINESS OWNERS COULD. SUGGESTED THEY USE A PO BOX STYLE ADDRESS LIKE UPS STORE INSTEAD OF THEIR HOME ADDRESS OR THEIR BUSINESS STOREFRONT. I WOULD ARGUE THAT THAT ALSO ADDS AN EXTRA CHALLENGE TO THE BUSINESS OWNER IN THE EXPENSE OF TRYING TO. SECURE THOSE ADDRESSES. OKAY SO THE. IF THAT IS THAT I CAN I CAN SEE THE SECRETARY OF STATE BEGINNING TO DO THAT MOVING FORWARD BUT THEY HAVE A DATABASE WITH MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF THESE FORMS ALREADY. THAT'S AND I THINK IT'S GONNA BE VERY ONEROUS TASK TO GO HAVE TO REDACT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM SO NOT SURE HOW THEY WOULD GO ABOUT DOING THAT RIGHT WILL THIS BILL ACTUALLY ASK FOR THEM TO DO IT AS A BUSINESS BOARD AS OPPOSED TO GOING BACK IN. ARREARS SO IT'S NOT ASKING TO GO BACK TO LIKE YOUR FILING THAT WAS DATED TWO THOUSAND EIGHT I WOULD STILL HAVE YOUR. YOUR PERSONAL ADDRESS FROM THERE BUT FOR YOUR ADDITIONAL NEWER FILINGS FROM TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN YOU'RE REFERENCING YOUR EXISTING TWO THOUSAND A FILING YOU COULD SUBMIT A NEW ONE. AND THEN THAT WOULD HAVE THE REDACTION BEAR WITH SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE. OKAY SO START THIS IS JUST FOR NEW FILING UNDERGRADUATE. BUSINESS PHOTOS NINETEEN SO ANYONE THAT WANTED TO FORGE A MILLION DOLLAR CHECK FOR GIRL SCOUT COOKIES WILL STILL BE CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT WELL THEN YOU WOULD BE UP TO TWO HAD A LOT OF GIRL SCOUT COOKIES. ALRIGHT AND THAT ONE JUST A. SUGGESTION WOULD BE THE WORDING OF THE BILLS IT STANDS. REQUIRES THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION ONLINE EXCEPT FOR A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT'S DIFFERENT THEY ON. REQUIRING THEM NOT TO POST THE THINGS THAT WERE IN THE WEST AND SO IF YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY AMEND THE BILL MAYBE YOU CAN. YOU CAN CLARIFY THAT THEY SHALL NOT POST THOSE THINGS ONLINE GOT IT THAT'S A VERY GOOD SUGGESTION RIGHT YOU ARE WILL ENJOY YOUR GIRL SCOUT COOKIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. CNN I WANNA I THINK YOU ALSO. FOR BRINGING THE THE BILL FORWARD. WHEN I WAS IN LAW PRACTICE I ACTUALLY HAVE FILED A LOT OF THE SAYS THE MEANS OF INFORMATION SO I AND I FULLY UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION AND. ARE IN FACT I I KNOW THERE. WERE A NUMBER OF TRIPS THAT I MADE TO THE SECULAR STATES OFFICE YOU KNOW PERSONALLY FIGHTING THESE THINGS SO I'D I DO I DO WITH ALSO AGREE THAT THAT THIS BILL STARTS RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN PROTECTING PRIVACY AND. THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW SO SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL AND I WOULD NOT DIE WHICH LIKE A CLOSE I JUST RESPECTFULLY ASPIRIN AYE BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A FULL QUORUM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT WE HAVE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER LIMO. WELCOME I BELIEVE YOU HAVE THREE BILLS AND ONE OF THEM IS ON CONSENT. THINK IT WAS FOUR AND ONE WAS ON CONSENT THAT'S ONE TWO THAT'S RIGHT. WHILE. TODAY'S THE. THAT SEEKS SO WHAT WHICH ONE WHICH LIKE A SILENT. DO I GO IN ORDER WE COULD DIE TO TOOT. TWO TWO TWO FIVE. THAT WOULD BE AB TWO TWO TO FIVE AND ANYTIME YOU'RE READY YOU MAY PROCEED AND BY THE WAY THIS IS. ITEM NUMBER EIGHT ON THE AGENDA SO. GO AT IT THANK YOU CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ASSEMBLY BILL TWO TWO TWO FIVE RATIFIES THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE BY RE. INSERTING UNIFORM STANDARDS FOR NON PERMANENT RECORDS IN THE STATE WITHOUT THIS REQUIREMENT THAT NON PERMANENT RECORDS FOLLOW ANY SORT OF ELECTRONIC STORAGE STANDARD AND WITHOUT ANY STATUTORY CLARITY FOR HOW TO HANDLE THESE RECORDS. THERE IS ARGUABLY A HUGE RISK POSED TO THE STATE. THIS BILL ALSO ENSURES THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITIES DO NOT CREATE VULNERABILITIES IN THE CLOUD WHEN THEIR RECORDS ARE MAINTAINED IN THE SAME CLOUD COMPUTING STORAGE SERVICE I SEE AGENCIES. I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE CONCERNS OVER CERTAIN THAT SECURITY STANDARDS AND THE DEFINITION OF CLOUD COMPUTING I WILL WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS IN APPROPRIATIONS. AND SHOULD THIS BILL MOVED OUT I HAVE WITH ME AT TED ANIMAL HOUSE OR WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE BUT HERE JUST FOR TECHNICAL A TESTIMONY IF NEEDED. AND JUST TO GIVE YOU ALL AN EXAMPLE OF WHY T. I. NON PERMANENT RECORD IS A WE WOULD LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE A VOTER REGISTRATION AFFIDAVIT THAT IS KEPT FOR A HUNDRED YEARS AND SEALED THAT'S AN EXAMPLE JUST SO PEOPLE KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH EFFORTS WHAT IS PLEASE WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D HAD MORE HOUSE ARE ON BEHALF OF SECRETARY OF STATE ALEX MEDIA. EARLIER TODAY AS SECRETARY VIDEO WAS PLEASE TAKE A SUPPORT POSITION ON AB TWO. TWO TWO FIVE THIS BILL DOES COMPLEMENT RECENT LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS TO UPDATE THIS AREA OF LAW PARTICULARLY THE PROVISION THAT ENSURES BOTH PERMANENT NON PERMANENT DOCUMENTS ARE COVERED. AND. UNIFIES THE DEFINITION OF CLOUD STORAGE I TRUSTED SYSTEM THAT WORKS REAL WELL FOR AGENCIES TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO DO. MAYBE TWO TWO TWO FIVE DOES MAKE IT. EASIER FOR STATE BOTH AND LOCAL AGENCIES DIRECTOR AND. WE LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE Q. SEVEN MEMBER THE NONPROFIT BILL. THANK YOU VERY MEASURE ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD. SCENE NINE. OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. SCENE THEN LET'S COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS MISTER OBERNOLTE GO AHEAD. THANKS VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR SO I. I THINK IT'S A GOOD BILL ARE DONE HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT ONE SUGGESTION I HAVE FOR YOU IS THAT. WITHIN THE BILL YOU'RE REFERENCING NON PERMANENT RECORDS AND NON PERMANENT DOCUMENTS AND IT'S CLEAR THAT FROM THE CONTEXT THAT YOU MEAN THAT IN THE THE WORD NON PERMANENT IN A LEGAL SENSE. HOWEVER THAT WORD ALSO HAS A TECHNICAL MEANING AND BECAUSE WE'RE DEALING WITH CLOUD COMPUTING I THINK IT'S GONNA BE VERY IMPORTANT NOT TO CONFLATE THOSE TWO MEETINGS AND SO ON TO SUGGEST THAT IF YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO AMENDED. THAT YOU CONSIDER PUTTING A RECITAL IN WHICH YOU TO FIND EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEAN BY. A BY NON PERMANENT RECORD. RIGHT POINT WELL TAKEN AND WE'RE DEFINITELY WORKING ON THAT CLARIFICATION. SO WE GOT WE STILL DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM SO WHEN WE DO HAVE QUENTIN WILLA. ON THROUGH THE MOTION ACCORDINGLY SAY WITHOUT WHICH I CLOSE RESPECTFULLY ASK A FRIEND AYE VOTE WHEN. THERE'S QUIRK THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND LET'S MOVE ONTO THE NEXT ITEM OF YEARS AND THAT IS SO PROBABLY TWENTY EIGHT TWELVE. THAT WAS A CONSENT OF STATE THAT ONCE ON. SO I THINK IT'S THIRTY TEN THIRTY TEN THAT'S CORRECT. MAYBE TEN RIGHT THERE. THAT'S ITEM EIGHTEEN ON THE AGENDA. THANK YOU I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS PROPOSED TO IN THE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES THAT THINK THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF. UP FOR WORKING WITH ME TO NARROW THE AMOUNT OF DATA THAT NEEDS TO BE COLLECTED IN ORDER TO MAKE IT PAY DAY ONE LOAN AT A TIME POLICY WORK. CHERRY MEMBERS AT LAST NIGHT THE ASSEMBLY BANKING COMMITTEE PASSED A A. B. THIRTY TWENTY APPROVING A ONE LOAN AT A TIME PAYDAY LOAN POLICY. WITH THIS BILL AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS PROHIBITED PAYDAY LENDER FROM ENTERING INTO AN ADDITIONAL PAYDAY LOAN WITH A BAR OR IF THAT BAR ALREADY HAS AN OUTSTANDING PAYDAY LOAN. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS LENDERS WOULD NEED A REAL TIME DATA BASE TO ACCURATELY CONTAINS INFORMATION. ON WHICH FIRES HAVE CURRENT ACTIVE PD LOANS THIS BILL PROVIDES FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN THE DATABASE INCLUDING ENSURING THAT THE DATA IS KEPT SAFE. THROUGH THE CURRENT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROTECTION PRACTICES AS CONTAINED IN CURRENT LAW. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL EXPRESSLY STATES THAT PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED BY LENDERS AND THE DB PUBLIC THROUGH A PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST. MEMBERS OF MY INTENT SHOULD THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD IS TO PROVIDE FOR THE CREATION OF A DATABASE THAT CONTAINS ONLY WHAT IS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT THE POLICY. AND THE DATA COLLECTED REMAIN AS SECURE AS POSSIBLE. AND TO DAY WITH ME THING. I THOUGHT SUSAN. NOT. SO WITH THAT YEAH OKAY SURE ARE AT THE. WE. MOST OF THREE TO HAVE MYSELF YES I DO HAVE THIS IN MIND ON HERE ARE WITH ME IN SUPPORTOF THE BILL FROM THE. CONSUMERS UNION TO JUSTIFY SORRY NO THANK YOU SORRY FOR THE MIX UP THERE ARE SO MANY RELATED BILLS HERE AND WE HAVE A VERY BUSY BUSY AN AMAZING AUTHOR HERE SO. US IS EMERGING WITH CONSUMERS UNION A WE SUPPORT. THAT THE IDEA OF ENSURING THAT THERE IS A WAY TO ENFORCE THE ONE LOAN AT A TIME REQUIREMENT. AGAIN THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT COMPONENT TO ENSURE THAT. WE ARE NOT ALONE LENDERS TO STACK CONSUMERS WITH MULTIPLE LOANS AT ONCE THERE IS AMPLE EVIDENCE FROM THE DDO AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS SHOWING THAT WHEN CONSUMERS HOBBIES MULTIPLE LOANS OUT ALL AT ONCE ARE SORT OF BORROWING FROM PETER TO PAY PAUL. AND IT CAN REALLY TO. SPIRAL DOWN INTO FINANCIAL RUIN SO BADLY THIS IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF. ARE WHAT'S GOING TO BE DISCUSSED ON THE NEXT BILL. DID THEIR WORK CHANGING THE LAW TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE ONE ON A TIME PER CUSTOMER TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM BEING STUCK IN A CYCLE OF DEBT. SO FOR THOSE REASONS BEYOND THE REQUEST OUT AND I VOTE THANK YOU STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH A ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. SEEING NONE LIKE TO INVITE OPPOSITION TO COME FORWARD. WELCOME THANK YOU. MARGARET LAD STEAM HERE ON BEHALF OF ADVANCE AMERICA I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO HAVE. NARROW THE BILL IS RECOMMENDED FOR THAT BUT IN THE ANALYSIS THAT WE TAKE STRONG ISSUE WITH THEM SIR BOTH ELEMENTS OF THE BILL AND ARGUED THAT THIS IS NOT A CONSUMER PROTECTION OR A PRIVACY BILL. UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW A CONSUMER CAN ONLY TAKE OUT A PAYDAY LOAN OF THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS WE DO NOT HAVE ANY BILLS THAT LIMIT HOW MANY CREDIT CARDS EACH OF YOU CAN HAVE IN YOUR WALLET HOW MANY CARLOAD YOU CAN HAVE OR HOW MANY MORTGAGE YOU CAN YOU CAN HAVE. IF YOU LIMIT THE NUMBER OF PAYDAY LOANS THAT A CUSTOMER CAN TAKE OUT AT ANY ONE TIME THESE ARE COME BORROWERS WHO ALREADY HAVE VERY LIMITED. CREDIT OPTIONS THEY WILL GO TO THE UNREGULATED UNLICENSED LENDERS WHO EITHER OPERATE ON THE INTERNET OR OPERATE ON STREET CORNERS IN A VARIETY OF OTHER PLACES. THEY HAVE NO CONSUMER PROTECTION IF THEY'RE NOT TAKING A LOAN FROM A LICENSED REGULATED LENDER THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT HAS A VERY AGGRESSIVELY TRIED TO GO AFTER UNLICENSED LENDERS WHO OPERATE FROM GUAM. THE ISLE OF MAN AND OTHER PLACES AND THEY'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET TO THOSE BORROWERS TO THOSE LENDERS SO THERE'S NO CONSUMER PROTECTION IN THAT REGARD. I WOULD ALSO ARGUE THAT ON THE DATABASE THERE ARE SO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS THIS IS A STATE MANDATED DATABASE WHERE LICENSEES WILL HAVE TO TRANSMIT SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS ORDER I AM INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER. AS WELL AS BY DEFINITION FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND SENSITIVE FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO THE STATE. THE STATE IS VERY LIKELY TO USE A VENDOR TO HAVE THIS DATABASE IN THERE ARE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS WE AS LICENSEES. HAVE ABOUT THE HOW THESE THIS WILL OPERATE IN VERY LIKELY ARE CONSUMERS WILL FEEL VERY LITTLE COMFORT. THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT THE VENDOR FOR THE STATE HAVE ANY INSURANCE IN CASE OF A DATA BREACH. THERE'S NO INDEMNITY FOR LICENSEES IF THERE IS A STATE MATTER DATA BREACH. WILL HAVE TO. DO WE HAVE TO BEAR THE COST AS LICENSEES WHO'S GOING TO BEAR THE COST WHO WILL PAY THAT. WHAT ABOUT A BREACH NOTICE WILL THAT REACH KNOWS COME FROM THE VENDOR WILL COME FROM THE LICENSEE? UNDER THE CURRENT CURRENTLY PENDING IN THE SENATE THERE'S A LAW THAT CREATES LIABILITY FOR DATA BREACHES WHO WILL PAY THAT LIABILITY. IS THE DEPARTMENT SOME BUSINESS OVERSIGHT ONE OF THEIR EXAMINERS WHO IS COMING TO OUR OFFICES IF THEIR COMPUTER IS STOLEN. WHO'S GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT LIABILITY. IF THERE'S NEGLIGENCE WHAT HAPPENS ON THE END THERE NO LIMITATIONS IN THIS BILL ON THE VENDORS USE OF THE INFORMATION THAT WE WERE MET. SO THAT BILL CURRENTLY IS SILENT ON WHETHER THE VETS DESCRIBED AS A CONFIDENTIAL DATABASE BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT THAT INFORMATION ON THAT WHAT THE VENDOR CAN AND CANNOT DO. SO THERE ARE A VARIETY OF UNDER ANSWERED QUESTIONS AND FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS WE MUST. OPPOSE AB THIRTY TEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. CHAIRMAN CHAO I'M TONY. SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF REGULATORY AFFAIRS FOR EXPERIENCE. HOW WERE CREDIT ABOUT BUREAU BASED AND? CALIFORNIA HAS TO. PRIMARY CONCERNS THAT WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE. IS THAT THE CREATION OF THE. STATE CONTROLLED DATABASE. WOULD REALLY NOT HELP THE CONSUMER IN TERMS OF HELPING THAT CONSUMER BUILD THEIR CREDIT HISTORY. UNLIKE OTHER CREDIT BUREAU DATABASES. WHAT A CONSUMER? PAYS ALONE ON TIME THEY SHOULD GET CREDIT FOR THAT DATABASE IN THIS IT FOR THAT DOT FOR THAT PERFORMANCE SUPER THAT BEHAVIOR IN THIS CASE. THIS TYPE OF DATA WOULD BE SEALED IN A SILO DATABASE AND NO OTHER LENDER WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE YOU THAT GOOD PERFORMANCE FROM THAT DATA. CONSUMER. WE ESTIMATE THAT THERE ARE FORTY FIVE MILLION CONSUMERS IN THE UNITED STATES MANY OF THEM IN CALIFORNIA. WHO ARE CREDIT INVISIBLES THEY WOULD BE THERE DON'T HAVE A CREDIT REPORT? UP FULL CREDIT REPORT MANY OF THEM DON'T EVEN HAVE A FINANCIAL IDENTITY. AND IF WE'RE GOING TO FORCE LENDERS TO REPORT TO A DATABASE WE THINK IT WOULD BE WISER. TO USE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE OF CREDIT REPORTING SYSTEMS THAT ALREADY EXIST. THERE WE THEREFORE WE CAN BUILD THOSE. CONSUMERS CREDIT FILES GIVE THEM MY FINANCIAL IDENTITY. AND GET THEM ON THE ROAD TO BETTER PRICED. TERMS AT AND SERVICES IN INTEREST RATES AND OTHER COMPETITIVE FINANCIAL MARKETS. THAT'S OUR CHIEF CONCERN. ANOTHER CONCERN IS THAT. WHAT? WHETHER INADVERTENTLY OR NOT. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS CREATING A CREDIT BUREAU IN THIS ACT. THE CREDIT THE DEFINITION OF A CREDIT BUREAUS ANY. ANY ENTITY INCLUDING A GOVERNMENT OF. AGENCY. THAT COLLECTS FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND SHARES IT WITH THE LENDER FOR PURPOSES OF ASSESSING ELIGIBILITY. FOR CREDIT. THAT IS WHAT THIS IS GOING TO DO IT'S GOING TO COLLECT DATA FROM. LENDERS AS GOING TO RETURN DATA TO LENDERS FOR ASSESSING CREDIT ELIGIBILITY FOR A SHORT TERM LOAN SO IT IS A. CREDIT BUREAU. WITH THAT COMES ALL OF THE INDEPENDENT. REQUIREMENTS OBLIGATIONS AND LEGAL. STANDARDS UNDER THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT. AS IMPORTS BY BOTH THE FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS. INCLUDING THE CONCEPT OF. MAXIMUM POSSIBLE ACCURACY IN CONSUMER FIVE. HEREIN WITH THESE AMENDMENTS WERE LIMITING THE NUMBER OF IDENTIFYING ELEMENTS THAT CAN COME WITH A REPORTED LAW EVER REPORTED LOAN. I TO ONLY SOCIAL SECURITY IN A. NUMBER. MAXIMUM POSSIBLE ACCURACY. FACT THE STANDARD IN THE CREDIT BUREAU SYSTEM AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW IS AT LEAST A NAME. AND ADDRESS A DATE OF BIRTH AND A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. IF YOU'RE LIMITING THE INFORMATION THAT THE. LENDERS CAN REPORT TO THE CREDIT BUREAU IN THIS CASE THE STATE. AND THE STATE CAN'T MATCH THOSE. LOANS TO THE RIGHT PERSON WITH A DEGREE OF ACCURACY REQUIRED BY THE BE IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW. AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS YOU WOULD HAVE MERGED. OR TRACK OR. OR. SEPARATED RECORDS AND THAT IS YOU MAY BE DENYING. SOMEONE CREDIT BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT MATCH THE RIGHT LOAN FOR YOU MATCH THE LOAN TO THE WRONG PERSON. SO THESE ARE VERY SERIOUS ISSUES. OUR THEY COME WITH SEVERE PENALTIES. THEY COME WITHOUT PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS AND JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF HOW IMPORTANT THESE MATCHING ELEMENTS ARE. I WE'VE RUN TESTS ON OUR OWN DATABASE. THERE ARE TWELVE JUAN GONZALEZ'S WITH SIMILAR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS WHO LIVE AND MAIN STREET IN SANTA ANA CALIFORNIA. SO MATCHING THESE RECORDS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE ACCURACY THAT WE WANT IN THESE. AND SO BY DENYING. LENDERS TO REPORT THESE UP LOANS TO THE CREDIT BUREAU USING A MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF IDENTIFYING AND GET THEIR INFORMATION IS VERY DANGEROUS NOW I UNDERSTAND. THE NEED TO BALANCE. PRIVACY AND SECURITY BUT WE ALSO HAVE THE STANDARD OF ACCURACY THAT MUST BE MET I WOULD HAVE TO SAY. THAT UNDER THIS LAW EXPERIAN COULD APPLY. AS THE CERTIFIED REPRESENTATIVE TO MANAGE THIS DATABASE BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I DOUBT THAT WE WOULD. BECAUSE WE COULDN'T SUSTAIN THE LIABILITY OF IT. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL WITNESSES SO IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD. MISTER MEMBERS RAINY PERRY THERE REGIS HAS HAD SOME HEALTH COMMUNITY CHOICE FINANCIAL IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT PLEASE. MISTER CHAIRMAN JOHN CABOT TECH ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU EXPLOITS. JASON SHELTER ABOUT FOR THE CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES. GOD. IF YOU'RE PATIENTS TRENT MATSON MONEY TREE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. AN ABSOLUTE GO CHECK IN A CASH OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. NATASHA FOREMAN WITH ADVANCE AMERICA IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES. EITHER SUPPORT OR OPPOSE SEEING NONE. LET'S UP BRING IT BACK TO OUR COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. OUR THAT YES MISGUIDED ED. VETERANS LEARN. SO I I YOU KNOW I'M NOT SURE I AGREE WITH THIS NOTION THAT WE SHOULD LIMIT EACH PERSON TO ONE PAYDAY LOAN BUT. LET'S JUST ASSUME THAT IF SOMEONE WOULD WANT TO ACCOMPLISH I'M WONDERING IF THERE MIGHT BE. AND I EASIER WAYS TO DO IT AND GREEN THIS BIG KNEW. DATABASE SEEMS LIKE QUITE AN UNDERTAKING OTHERS PRIVACY CONCERNS APPARENTLY ISSUES OF RELIABILITY. POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR THE STATE. I SO YOU KNOW WHAT ABOUT JUST HAVING THE PAYDAY LENDERS ASK PEOPLE YET ANOTHER ONE OUT. AT THAT I DON'T THINK WOULD WORK AND I I DON'T I DON'T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE THAT THAT WOULD WORK AND THAT IT WOULD GET TO THE END GOAL WHICH IS ENSURING. THAT. A CONSUMER. THIS IS ONE OF MULTIPLE PRODUCTS IF YOU NEED MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS THERE'S A DIFFERENT PRODUCT FOR YOU AND SO THE IDEA IS THAT THIS. BILL WOULD NOT ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO STACK BUT RATHER IT WOULD DIRECT IN TO A DIFFERENT PRODUCT THE THREE HUNDRED OVER PRODUCT THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED ARE IN OVER PRODUCT. SO I THINK THAT THIS IS WHAT THAT'S REALLY ABOUT. I WOULD SAY THAT ON THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF I THINK BANKING POLICY IT DIDN'T ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN. BROUGHT UP HERE AND THE BANKING COMMITTEE DID GET THIS BILL OUT YESTERDAY SO THOSE WERE DISCUSSED IN BANKING ONE WAS WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A MERRY OF ONE. A LOAN AT A TIME THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE THAT THIS IS CREATING A CREDIT FOR I THINK THAT THERE IS SOME DIFFERENCE IN OPINIONS THERE. AND AND THE ISSUE OF CREDIT REPORTING ALL TOGETHER IS I THINK THAT IT VIA A DIFFERENT ISSUE FOR THE BANKING COMMITTEE. AS FAR AS THE DATABASE IS CONCERNED AND WE KNOW THAT THE COMMITTEES YEAH STAFF WAS VERY. HELPFUL IN HELPING US MARY DOWN WE'RE VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE WE DON'T COLLECT MORE WE DON'T COLLECT LESS THAN THE INFORMATION WE NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE COLLECT JUST THE RIGHT INFORMATION THROUGH VERY OPEN TO HAVING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT. WHAT EXACTLY IS THE RIGHT INFORMATION AND WHAT EXACTLY IS THE RIGHT TOOL AND THAT? WERE ABSOLUTELY READY I MEAN TO TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. ABOUT THE DATABASE ITSELF THAT'S HELPFUL THANK YOU AND BUT YOU KNOW IF SOMEONE GOES INSIDE AND THEY ASK OUR IDEA OF ANOTHER PAY ONE OUT IN PERSON SAYS. YES I DO THEM I CAN'T IS A STAR YOU'RE ON ELIGIBLE ONE OF ONE NETWORK. YEAH WELL THEY'D WANNA VERIFY THAT INFORMATION I THINK THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT TO VERIFY THE INFORMATION JUST LIKE WE VERIFY OTHER INFORMATION OUT THERE FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES. ON THIS IS. SHORT TERM. YOU KNOW BARRING LOAN OF SORTS AND SO I THINK THAT WE WOULD DO THAT FOR OTHER LOANS AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO IT TO MAKE PEOPLE AND BE TRUTHFUL ABOUT THE CONCERN. I THINK IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT IDEA I THINK IT COULD BE DIFFERENT THINGS I THINK THAT COULD BE ONE OF THEM I ALSO THINK AND. THAT PEOPLE HOW YOU KNOW HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO GO GET MORE THAN ONE A DAY AND SO THE IDEA IS THAT. WHAT WHT THAT THE OF THE GOAL IS FOR THE CONSUMER TO GET THE RIGHT PRODUCT AND IF THE THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS THE PAYDAY LOAN ITSELF ISN'T THE RIGHT PRODUCT FOR THEM AND THEY NEED MORE? THAN THEY SHOULD GO DIFFERENT ONE AND AND ALL OF THE PRODUCTS OUT THERE HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF THE. GUIDELINES AND RESTRICTIONS IN TERMS OF WHAT KIND OF THE GOVERNMENT'S LAWS AROUND THEN I'M IN THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AS IN TIME YEAH I'M TRYING TO HELP YOUR COUSINS AT A LOT OF CONCERNS AROUND THE DATABASE SO. I KNOW WHAT YOU JUST HAD SOMEONE SIGN SOMETHING SAYING THIS IS MY ONLY PAID A ONE WITHOUT WORK DO THINK. I KNOW SO I MEAN JUST IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE DON'T ASK OF PEOPLE WHETHER OR NOT THEY'VE EXCEEDED THEIR CREDIT YOU KNOW LIMIT ON THEIR CARD AND PEOPLE USE IT I THINK IT'S ALONG THE SAME WAY THAT SHOULD BE A SYSTEM IN PLACE. THAT. THE YOU KNOW BUSINESS IS ABLE TO TRACK AND SO THIS IS REALLY ABOUT MAKING SURE IN TRACKING AND MAKING SURE THAT THE BUSINESSES AND COMPLIANCE AND ALSO MAKING SURE THAT THE CONSUMER IS DIRECTED TO THE RIGHT PRODUCT. OKAY HIGH AND I I SEE THAT POINT I GUESS I GUESS MY THOUGHT IS THAT YOU KNOW SOMEONE IS. WHEN TO LIE IN ORDER TO GET ONE OF THESE LOANS ARE GOING TO YOU KNOW FIND AFFINITY PER YEAR SOMETHING THEN THAT'S PRIDE HAVE PERSON THAT WOULD THEN BE WILLING TO GO OUT AND TRY TO FIND. YOU KNOW SOMEONE REGULATED TYPE OF WOUND SOME KIND OF WONDERING. AT HOW MUCH BENEFIT REALLY A GET OUT OF THE DATABASE WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE COST BENEFIT THERE AYE I WOULD BE RUNNING THE BILL IF I DIDN'T THINK THAT THERE IS A BENEFIT. TO IT UPON. SO I AM VERY CLEAR THAT I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A BENEFIT TO THIS I BELIEVE THAT IT IS ALSO ABOUT HELPING THE CONSUMER AND GUIDING THEM. I YOU KNOW AS SOMEONE WHO'S WALKED INTO MULTIPLE OF THESE PAID A LEN STORIES AROUND THE STATE AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET THE RIGHT INFORMATION TO MAKE SURE I MEAN WHEN YOU GO OUT TO THE GROCERY STORE AT ONCE YOU START TO KNOW YOUR GROCERY STORE TO. MAKE A DECISION ON WHETHER YOU'RE GONNA GO TO COSTCO OR WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO NOTICE MARGARET YOU SIR BASED ON THE NEEDS I THINK IT'S ABOUT UNDERSTANDING. AND THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE OUT THERE UNDERSTANDING THE NEED AND MAKING SURE THAT FOR WHATEVER YOU'RE SHOPPING WHERE EVERY ARE GETTING. AT THE PRODUCT THAT MEETS THAT NEED THAT YOU HAVE THAT THERE'S A SYSTEM IN PLACE AND TO VERIFY THAT THAT'S THE RIGHT PIECE FOR YOU I MEAN. IN MY MIND I THINK LOANS AND FINANCES ARE IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO HAVE YOU KNOW A DOUBLE CHECK AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE. YOU KNOW GETTING FOLKS INTO THE RIGHT. PRODUCT THAT THEY NEED I THINK THAT THERE'S ALSO LONG TERM A IMPACTS TO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY'RE STACKING. YESTERDAY THERE IS A ROBUST CONVERSATION IN THE COMMITTEE ABOUT WHAT STACKING MEANS AND WHAT THE NUMBERS REALLY LOOK LIKE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL AND HOW YOU KNOW THERE ARE A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA THEY GET THE SAME ONE. MORE THAN TEN TIMES IN A ROW AT A FORTY FIVE DOLLAR FEE ON AT THAT POINT THAT SEE THAT YOU'VE ADDED AN ACCUMULATED IS MUCH MORE THAN THE LOAN ITSELF. AND SO I THINK THAT THERE'S A NUMBER OF AT OF PIECES OF EVIDENCE THAT LEAD ME TO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY THE RIGHT APPROACH FOR A AS OPPOSED TO JUST HAVING SOMEONE VERIFY THEMSELVES. OF ONE OTHER THAT DISCUSS SIDE ISSUE AYE AYE KNOWS THE BILL'S TAG MAJORITY VOTE BUT THERE'S THIS. AFTER THE THAT. YOU KNOW DOESN'T REALLY SEEM TO AND THIS IS REALLY BENEFIT BENEFIT THE FOLKS WHO ARE PAYING FOR IT IS EGGMAN LOOKED AT WHETHER THIS IS MORE PROPERLY CONSIDERED A FEAR ATTACKS AND WHETHER THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A TWO THIRDS OF I JUST HATE FOR IT TO. GO THROUGH THE DOOR SUDDENLY IN IN COURT AFTERWARDS. I I'M SORRY CAN YOU CLARIFY WHAT FEE AND WHERE DID YOU SEE THAT SO THE LICENSEES ARE THE FOLKS WHO ARE ACCESSING THE DATABASE ARE THEY. I THINK IN YOUR BILL AS OPPOSED TO PAY A FEE IN ORDER TO. ACCESS IT. IT'S A LICENSE. YEAH SO WE HAVE LICENSES GET ALL OVER BUSINESS COMMUNITIES HAVE LICENCES THEY PLAYED THEY PAY FOR AN ADULT LOT OF DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES NOT JUST IN THIS PARTICULAR FINANCE WHEN. OTHER THAT CORRECTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SEEING NONE ARE. I I DON'T WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT. YA FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I THINK IT'S ALWAYS HELPFUL TO HAVE MORE INFORMATION. GAIA BUT YET I THINK OUT WE DON'T WANT TO BE EXCESSIVE WE AND COLLECTING THE INFORMATION AND ALSO WE WANTED TO PROTECT THE. CONSUMERS INTO MISSION AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN AT LEAST TO OUR COMMITTEES FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON PRIVACY AND CONSUMERS. SO AS WELL AS TO WHETHER KNOCKED OUT YOU KNOW WE SHOULD GRAN DIED ADDITIONAL PAYDAY LOANS TO TO CONSUMERS I THINK. I THINK I BELIEVE THAT YOU MENTION THAT YOU HAVE HAD THAT DISCUSSION THIRD DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT YESTERDAY SO WE WILL NOT GONNA RE HASHED OUT HERE. SO ARM SO IN GENERAL I THINK IT YOU KNOW THIS CONCEPT BY IKE I COULD SUPPORT AND ON YET YOU KNOW I THINK IF THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE I URGE YOU TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS SO FROM THIS POINT ON. AND SEE IF THERE'S A YOU KNOW WAIT HERE. GETS MORE ON A BIAS FROM THE UP OPPOSITION AS WELL. SO WE GOT THAT WHICH LIKE THE CLOSE RESPECTFULLY ASPIRIN I. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WHEN WAS WE HAVE QUORUM THEN WILL LOOK AT THAT GUN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I BELIEVE YOU HAVE ONE MORE BILL. AND. LET'S SEE. THAT WOULD BE ITEM NUMBER TWENTY THAT'S AB THIRTY TWO OH SEVEN. AB THIRTIES. CAN I START YAK NDA HIM. RIGHT YOU YOU MAY BEGIN GREAT THANK YOU A. B. THIRTY TWO SEVEN WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR THE THOUSANDS OF CONSUMERS SERVICE BY THE FINANCE LENDERS AND BROKERS LICENSE. UNDER THE CALIFORNIA FINANCING LAW. UNDER EXISTING LAW THE DEFINITION OF BROKER IS VAGUE AND CIRCULAR LEADING TO THE CONFUSION OF FROM LENDERS ABOUT WHICH ENTITIES THEY CAN PARTNER WITH AND WENT WHEN ARRANGING LOANS. FURTHER THE DEFINITION OF BROKER IN EXISTING LAW WAS FORMULATED LONG BEFORE THE RISE OF THE INTERNET AND EVOLUTION OF ONLINE WILL LEND ONLINE LEAD GENERATION SO OUR LAWS NEED TO BE UPDATED. WITH THIS ONLINE ACTIVITY IN MIND LEAD GENERATE BARRIERS PROVIDE VALUABLE MARKETING SERVICES TO A WIDE RANGE OF INDUSTRIES HOWEVER MANY ONLINE LEAD GENERATORS THAT SERVE THE LENDING INDUSTRY PROVIDE MORE THAN JUST MARKETING SERVICE. THESE ENTITIES ACT AS BROKERS WHEN THEY'RE TRYING WHEN THEY BRING BARS AND LENDERS TOGETHER TO ARRANGE A LOAN BASED ON SENSITIVE DATA PROVIDED BY A PROSPECTIVE. A PROSPECTIVE PARA BORRAR THIS BILL WILL ALLOW ONLINE THE GENERATORS TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA BUT THEY BELIEVE BE REQUIRED TO BE LICENSED BY THE DEPARTMENT. OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT AS THE STATE'S FINANCIAL REGULATOR THE DB ó IS CHARGED WITH REGULATING HOW BROKERS INTERACT WITH CONSUMERS TO ENSURE THAT BROKERS DO NOT ENGAGE IN UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE PRACTICES TO STEER CONSUMERS. INTO LOANS THAT DO NOT MEET THEIR NEEDS. I COMMIT TO WORKING WITH INDUSTRY TO ENSURE THE BILL APPROPRIATELY ADDRESSES THE CONSUMER PROTECTION CONCERNS IN OUR LENDING MARKETS WITHOUT PLACING UNNECESSARY BURDENS. ON THE BSINESSES THAT PROVIDE THE SERVICES. THE BILL HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT AND A COALITION OF CONSUMER ADVOCATES WHO ARE HERE TODAY TO VOICE THEIR SUPPORT. AND HERE AGAIN WE HAVE SUSAN. MARTINDALE WHO'S GOING TO COMMENT. HELLO AGAIN CHAIRMAN MEMBERS US IS AND MARTIN DEL WITH CONSUMERS UNION IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE HERE WE. SUPPORT EFFORTS TO CLARIFY IDBI JURISDICTION OVER COMPENSATED THIRD PARTIES OR HELP ORIGINATE LOANS FOR CONSUMERS ALTHOUGH THE RISE OF THE INTERNET HAS LED TO THE PROLIFERATION OF ONLINE LEAD GENERATION SERVICES. YOU'RE HELPING TO BROKER A LOAN YOU'RE HELPING TO BROKER A LOAN AND SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THERE'S OVERSIGHT OF THIRD PARTIES. THAT UPS. TYPICALLY BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING COMPENSATED HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO GET SOMEONE AND ABOUT LOAN AND SO WHAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IS THAT THERE IS REGULATORY OVERSIGHT AND THAT THE DB ó. IS GOING IN AND CHECKING TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE IN A MARKETING THESE LOANS HANDLING SENSITIVE INFORMATION PREPARING DOCUMENTS AND REALLY ACTING AS AN AGENT OF THE LENDER WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THOSE FOLKS ARE BEING REGULATED SUPERVISED. ON OUR SUBJECT TO BACKGROUND CHECKS ALL OF THE THINGS THAT COME WITH THE DB O. BROKERS LICENSING REQUIREMENTS SO FOR THESE REASONS WE THINK THIS IS A SENSIBLE WAY TO UPDATE EXISTING LAW TO MAKE SURE THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS KEEP UP. WITH TECHNOLOGY. AND THAT'S WHY WE SUPPORT THE THE BILL AND REQUEST LIKE THAT. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. EDITION WOULD STILL HAVE GOOD AFTERNOON RONALD COLMAN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION CLICK ALSO HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. I GUESS IT UP ON THE DS FROM THE CENTER FOR RESPONSIBLE LENDING ALSO IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU MUCH NEXT PLEASE. OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME UP SHE LIKE TO MAKE ROOM FOR ONE MORE YET DAVID KEENE TANA BUT. GET THAT. OKAY. DAVID CANTON WITH THE ONLINE LENDERS ALLIANCE AND WE ARE HERE IN A POSITION OF OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. BUT THAT BEING SAID WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH AUTHOR AND HER COMMITTEE STAFF AND WE FEEL VERY OPTIMISTIC THAT IS AS THIS BILL MOVES THROUGH TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE. BASED UPON OUR CONVERSATIONS THAT I THINK WE SHOULD GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE ARE. IN IN MUTUAL AGREEMENT SO A BUT TO ELABORATE A LITTLE MORE IN OUR CONCERN I HAVE WITH ME DONALD ON THE HEAD OF COMPLIANCE WITH A LICENSE LEAD GENERATOR. LOAN CALL. RIGHT. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE GOD MAKE YOU DAVID IN A. SO. DID TODAY'S. QUITE SPECIAL WHEN AND THAT'S BECAUSE I AS A YOUNG UCLA STUDENT A. I I STILL RECALL MY PARENTS ARE. PUSHING ME TO GET A PHOTO WITH THAT CHAIRMAN SHALL. THEY WERE RESIDENTS OF SAN GABRIEL. SO THIS IS THAT KIND OF A FULL CIRCLE FOR ME. JUST A SO SO WE'RE HERE TODAY TO OPPOSE THIS BILL I WANT. AMENDED. BUT. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR. SENATE CHAIRPERSON LIMON IN OUR COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. IS SOME OF THE MAIN CONCERNS OF THIS BILL IS THAT. IT. IT DOESN'T SEPARATE TO THE DEFINITION OF A BROKER AND A LEAD GENERATOR. THEY'RE TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS. BROKER WILL HELP YOU GET YOUR PAPERWORK SIGN. SPED THE HANDLE THE APPLICATION THEY NEGOTIATE A BETTER DEAL FOR YOU. LEAD GENERATOR LIKE US LOCAL. WE DON'T. WE DON'T DO THAT WE SIMPLY CONNECT THE CONSUMER TELANDER WE SIMPLY. AND MAKES INTRODUCTIONS AND SAY HERE'S THE CONSUMER WE DON'T DO ANY NEGOTIATION WHERE WE DON'T DO ANY. HANDING HANDLING OF THE APPLICATION. SO. IN CONCLUSION LEAD GENERATORS LIKE US OR A CRUCIAL PART OF CONSUMER PROTECTION. SNEH THOUGH REASON I KNOW THAT IS BECAUSE THE MY TEAM AND I WE BET OUR LENDERS EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND WE REVIEW MARKETING CONTENT EVERY SINGLE DAY TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE NOT DECEPTIVE. TO CONSUMERS. SO PLEASE ALONE PLEASE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US AND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT ONE IS PLACE. MISTER CHAIR MEMBER SCOTT GOVERNOR BEHALF CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSOCIATION LIKE I THINK THE CONSULTANT FOR A TRAFFIC ANALYSIS THE ONLY THING IT'S MISSING OUR. SUGGESTIONS THAT HAD A HOW TO IMPROVE THESE ITEMS. I AGREE WITH THE PRIOR WITNESS OF LIKE TO ADD ONE THING THAT THE BILL IS SOMEWHAT. OPEN ENDED. AS REFERENCE BY THE STAFF AND THEN GOES FURTHER BY SAYING INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WHICH MEANS EVERYTHING IN THE BILL OF THE DEFINITIONS IN THE BILL. COULD BE FURTHER EXPANDED BY DB ó. PROBLEMATIC WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE'S SHOULD TAKE THAT ROLE AND NOT GIVE CARTE BLANCHE TO THE RIGHT REGULATOR. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH BEFORE WE GO TO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES A LIKE TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM. MADAM SECRETARY WELCOME PLACE CHILDCARE CAT KILEY. BAKER. BERMAN. CALDERON. IRWIN. MULLIN. OBERNOLTE HERE. VARIOUS. KING. I SELECT TO ENTERTAIN MOTION TO APPROVE TO TODAY'S AGENDA CONSENT AGENDA. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. CONSENT AGENDA. THIS IS FOR THE V. NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN. AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY NINE. AB TWENTY EIGHT TWELVE. AND AB THIRTY TWO TWENTY NINE. SHALL TYPE I. HIGHLY. AYE BAKER. BERMAN ON I CALDERON. IRWIN. I MULLIN. OBERNOLTE I REYES IF. I KING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO LET'S A RESUME AND NOT GO BACK TO THE WITNESSES WHO ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IV COULD IDENTIFY YOURSELF AND ALSO TELL US THE ORGANIZATION THAT YOU'RE AFFILIATED WITH HOW WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. SEEING NONE ARE. WEINER'S NO TUNERS IS BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE ARE QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THOSE BEEN MOVED. AND SECOND IT. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. LET ME SHARE A COUPLE THOUGHTS WITH THE ARM. I. ALSO AGREE THAT. ALI GENERATORS SO ON MAYBE IF COULD BE DIFFERENTIATED FROM BROKERS. BECAUSE WHEN I WAS IN PRACTICE I I ALSO HAVE TO DEAL WITH BROKERS ARE FINDERS AND THE LIKE. AYE YET UP. ARE CONSUMERS NEED TO BE PROTECTED REGARDLESS WHETHER THE CONTACT WAS A BROKER OR A LEAD GENERATOR WILL FIGHTER SO I THINK THIS IS A GOOD A GOOD BILL. ARM AND I THINK THAT UP THERE MIGHT BE ARE ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH FOR THAT DOWN THE ROAD AND I AM. PLEASED TO SEE AND HEAR FROM THE CAN THIS TREE FOLKS THAT THEY'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU AND VICE VERSA SO ARE CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT THE BILL IS GOING TO GO TO. TO BANKING NEXT. SO I THINK YOU GUYS WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO KIND OF. DUKE IT OUT. SO THIS WEEK THAT I HOPE YOU WORK IT OUT. SO. I AM PLEASED TO SEE THAT SO. WOULD DOUBT I LIKE TO. HERE OF YOUR CLOSING ARGUMENTS SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND I THINK YOU'RE CORRECT WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DEFINITIONS ARE THERE I THINK THE MOST SIMPLE THIS WAY THIS IS ABOUT. AND HOW LENDERS AND BUYERS GET PAIRED TOGETHER AND UNDERSTANDING WHO HAS WHAT ROLE AND MAKING SURE CONSUMERS HAVE PROTECTIONS IN AND IN TERMS OF EVERY ROLE THAT THE. INVOLVED IN CONNECTING THE LENDERS IN BARS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WITHOUT DOUBT MADAM SECRETARY ROLL CALL PLEASE. DO PASSED TO BANKING AND FINANCE. CHAU AYE AYE KILEY. NO BAKER. BERMAN. I. CALDERON. WHEN. I MULLIN. OBERNOLTE NO. REYES. I TING. IT DOESN'T COST. THANK YOU THANK YOU MUCH NEXT WE HAVE MISTER CHU IS UP NEXT I BELIEVE. AND MR CHU HAS. ITEM NUMBER SIX. WELCOME MR CHIU IN THE YOU HAVE TWENTY AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY FOUR GRAY ANYTIME YOU'RE READY YOU MAY BEGIN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COLLEAGUES AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY FOUR. WOULD ALLOW IMMIGRANTS TO START AND RUN BUSINESSES BY ALLOWING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT LICENSE BUSINESSES TO ACCEPT. A CALIFORNIA DRIVER'S LICENSE AND INDIVIDUAL TAX ID NUMBER OR A MUNICIPAL ID. WHILE THE SNOW IN OUR STATE THAT THE ECONOMIC SUCCESS OF CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN BUILT BY THE TREMENDOUS WORK. OF OUR IMMIGRANT WORKERS AND BUSINESS FOUNDERS. IMMIGRANTS CONTRIBUTE THIRTY TWO PERCENT OF OUR STATE'S GDP ONE OUT OF THREE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IN OUR STATE ARE IMMIGRANTS AND IN RECENT YEARS. FORTY FIVE PERCENT OF ALL NEW BUSINESSES WERE FOUNDED BY IMMIGRANTS. UNFORTUNATELY ABOUT HALF OF THE CITIES IN OUR STATE REQUIRE AN APPLICANT FOR A BUSINESS LICENSE TO PROVIDE A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. THIS HAS BEEN A SYSTEMIC BARRIER TO MANY CALIFORNIANS SEEKING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY THROUGH BUSINESS OWNERSHIP. RESTAURANTS AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS HOUSE CLEANERS AND BABY SITTERS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICE PROVIDERS. THIS BILL PROVIDES A BUILT ON PREVIOUS STATE LAWS THAT ALLOW APPLICANTS FOR LICENSES TO PROVIDE A FEDERAL ID NUMBER. AS WELL AS CITIES THAT ALLOW FOR MUNICIPAL ID'S THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL LAW WHICH AUTHORIZES STATES THAT MAKE PROFESSIONAL AND COMMERCIAL LICENSES AVAILABLE TO IMMIGRANTS REGARDLESS OF STATUS. THE BILL ALSO PROTECTS THE NUMBERS COLLECTED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT FROM DISCLOSURE. EXCEPT AS REQUIRED TOADMINISTER THE PROGRAM OR COMPLY WITH THE STATE LAW OR A FEDERAL COURT ORDER AND I ALSO SHOULD HAVE STARTED BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS IN ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS. WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK OUR SPONSORS THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER AND THE LAWYERS COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS AND TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESSES. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SUSHIL JACOB AND I'M A STAFF ATTORNEY AT LAWYERS COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. A CO SPONSOR OF AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY FOUR. LAWYERS COMMITTEE FOCUSES ON CIVIL RIGHTS IN THE ECONOMY PARTICULARLY ON EXPANDING ACCESS TO ENTREPRENEURSHIP FOR MINORITIES AND IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. THE NEED FOR THIS BILL AROSE FROM OUR WORK WITH IMMIGRANT BUSINESS OWNER CLIENTS. AND FROM PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE INCLUDING THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE WE LEARNED THAT MANY LOCALITIES REQUIRE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS ON LOCAL BUSINESS APPLICATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF OUR CLIENTS IS BROUGHT TO THE U. S. AT THE AGE OF FIVE. SHE GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND COULD NOT ATTEND COLLEGE. INSTEAD SHE STARTED A BUSINESS IN YOUR COMMUNITY SELLING HOME DECOR ITEMS. AND PORTED FROM HER HOME REGION OF MEXICO. HOWEVER DUE TO OAKLAND SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER REQUIREMENT SHE COULDN'T PERSONALLY OBTAIN A BUSINESS LICENSE. INSTEAD SHE ENDED UP OPENING THE BUSINESS AND HER YOUNGER SISTER'S NAME. BECAUSE HER SISTER HAD A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. THAT TEMPORARY FIX CREATED MANY OTHER PROBLEMS FOR OUR CLIENT BECAUSE HE WAS DEPENDENT ON HER SISTER DESIGN ALL OF HER BUSINESS DOCUMENTS INCLUDING GETTING BANK LOANS. SUCH BARRIERS PREVENTED OUR CLIENT FROM EXPANDING HER STORE TO ADDITIONAL LOCATIONS. BECAUSE OF THE FEAR OF ADDITIONAL LIABILITY AND CAUSING STRAIN IN HER RELATIONSHIP WITH HER SISTER. THE CLIENT HAD SINCE OBTAINED A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AND TRANSFER THE BUSINESS TO HER NAME. AND OUR CLIENT WOULD LIKE LAWMAKERS TO KNOW THAT MANY UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE IN CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE THERE AND UNABLE TO LEGALLY GET JOBS. AND LOCAL BUSINESS APPLICATIONS THAT REQUIRE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS PLACE FURTHER BARRIERS ON THEIR ABILITY TO SURVIVE AND REMAIN HERE. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND. M. YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR NECKS WHEN HIS PLACE THAT AFTERNOON MISTER CHANG COMMITTEE MEMBERS JEAN AT THE SILVA GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS MANAGER WITH THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER. WE ARE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR THESE EFFORTS TO REMOVE BARRIERS. TO BUT IT BUSINESS OWNERSHIP BY CLARIFYING THAT OTHER FORMS OF GOVERNMENT ID MAY BE USED TO APPLY FOR A BUSINESS LICENSE WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING SOME CONFIDENTIALITY OF THAT PERSONAL INFORMATION. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU SAID THIS LEGISLATION IS REALLY CONSISTENT WITH LOCAL AND STATE LAWS THAT FULLY INTEGRATE IMMIGRANTS INTO OUR STATE'S ECONOMY AND PUBLIC LIFE. WHILE ALSO SUPPORTING REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND PROTECTING THE PRIVACY RIGHTS OF OUR RESIDENTS. EVERYDAY IS A NEW HEADLINE REGARDING THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORTS TO TARGET IMMIGRANT FAMILIES AND WE MUST CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT OUR RESIDENTS ARE PROTECTED AGAINST THEIR EFFORTS TO CRIMINALIZE AND DEPORT CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE A CRITICAL PART OF OUR SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FABRIC. WE THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU FOR HIS CONTINUED LEADERSHIP ON PASSING PRO IMMIGRANT LEGISLATION AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS AYE EFFORT TOWARDS JUSTICE INCLUSION AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL WITNESSES PLEASE COME FORWARD. YOUR NAME AND YOUR ORGANIZATION PLACE. NO I BOTTOM ALL REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT PLEASE. HELLO ANGELINA ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE. I INGRAM IS CELIA OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU NICE. EVEN HUMANISM BE HAVE A BRADLEY DEFENSE STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. A LITTLE COUSIN OF US IN OF IMMIGRANT PARENTS. HERE'S A CALIFORNIA CITIZEN AND STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU MUCH. OPPOSITION. SCENE NINE ARE BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. BILL'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED OF. NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS SIR WHICH LIKE A CLOSE MISTER. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S SUPPORT I KNOW THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT ARE IMMIGRANT. OF BUSINESS FOUNDERS ARE TOURIST ECONOMY AND WITH THAT. HOPEFULLY YOU CAN WITH THE SUBCOMMITTEE TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MADAM SECRETARY RECALL PLEASE. AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY FOUR DO PASS AS AMENDED TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT. CHAPTER AYE KILEY LOW BUT NOT VOTING BAKER. BERMAN. I. CALDERON. IRWIN. AYE MULLIN. OBERNOLTE. NO. RENTS. ARE. FOR. YOUR BILLS ON CALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT BRINGS US TO ON MISTER BLOOM. I BELIEVE YOU HOW OF OUR AB TWENTY NINE NINETY EIGHT. WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE. ANYTHING ELSE AS ITEM NUMBER SEVENTEEN ON THE AGENDA. TWENTY NINE NINETY EIGHT SO ANYTIME YOU'RE READY YOU MAY. BEGIN THANK YOU MUST SHARE MEMBERS THIS BILL PROHIBITS THE SALE OF CERTAIN MATTRESSES JUVENILE PRODUCTS. AND A POLLSTER RE UPHOLSTERED FURNITURE IN CALIFORNIA IF THEY CONTAIN TOXIC FLAME RETARDANTS. THE BILL SEEKS TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS IN PARTICULAR CHILDREN AND FIREFIGHTERS WHO ARE OFTEN EXPOSED TO THESE CHEMICALS AND THEIR DERIVATIVES. AT FAR HIGHER LEVELS THAN THE GENERAL PUBLIC. FOR DECADES FLAME RETARDANT CHEMICALS HAVE BEEN ADDED TO MANY HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS INCLUDING MATTRESSES SOFAS AND JUVENILE PRODUCTS. WE NOW KNOW THAT THESE CHEMICALS THEMSELVES ARE TOXIC CAUSING A NUMBER OF ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS IN INDIVIDUAL X. EXPOSED TO THEM. INCLUDING REPRODUCTIVE IMPAIRMENT NEUROLOGICAL IMPACTS ENDOCRINE DISRUPTION AND CANCER. FLAME RETARDANTS ARE DANGEROUS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC BUT THEY POSE A PARTICULARLY HIGH THREAT TO PACIFIC POPULATIONS INCLUDING CHILDREN AND FIREFIGHTERS. INFANTS ARE OFTEN EXPOSED TO FLAME RETARDANT CHEMICALS THROUGH CONTAMINATED DUST AND BREAST MILK AND HAVE BEEN FOUND TO HAVE THESE CHEMICALS IN THEIR BODIES. AB THREE TO FIVE TIMES THAT FOUND IN THEIR MOTHERS. FIREFIGHTERS ARE ALSO EXPLETIVES TO FLAME RETARDANTS AND THEIR DERIVATIVES AT HIGHER LEVELS THAN THE GENERAL PUBLIC WHEN FLAME RETARDANT CHEMICALS BURN THEY RELEASED CARCINOGENIC SUBSTANCES. KNOWN AS DIOXINS AND FURANS. THESE CHEMICALS ARE INHALED BY FIREFIGHTERS AND LINGER ON PROTECTIVE CLOTHING EVEN AFTER FIREFIGHTER LEAVES THE SITE OF A FIRE. WE ARE SEEING HIGHER RATES OF CANCER AMONG FIREFIGHTERS THAN EVER BEFORE AND FLAME RETURNS ARE SEEN AS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN CALIFORNIA UPDATED ITS FLAMMABILITY STANDARDS DETERMINING THAT THE ADDITION OF FLAME RETARDANT CHEMICALS. DO NOT ADD TO FIRE SAFETY AND INSTITUTING A NEW STANDARD THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE THEIR USE TODAY MANY MANUFACTURERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. HAVE VOLUNTARILY REMOVED THESE CHEMICALS FROM THEIR PRODUCTS HOWEVER STRAGGLERS CONTINUE TO REMAIN IN WE CANNOT FULLY PROTECT THE PUBLIC. WITHOUT A RESTRICTION ON THE SALE OF SPECIFIC PRODUCTS CONTAINING THESE CHEMICALS. THE PRODUCTS AFFECTED BY THIS BILL MATTRESSES UPHOLSTERED FURNITURE AND JUVENILE PRODUCTS DO NOT NEED FLAME RETARDANTS IN ORDER TO MEET. STATE AND FEDERAL SAFETY FIRE SAFETY. OF STANDARDS. AB TWENTY NINE NINETY EIGHT PUTS THE CONSUMER SAFETY FIRST. AND IT WILL PROTECT OUR CHILDREN. IT WILL AS WELL PROTECT THE HEALTH OF FIREFIGHTERS AND TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL ARE OUT OF OUR CASA NOVA. ON BEHALF OF THE CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND CHRISTY BOMA ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS THAT VERY MUCH EFFORTS WHEN HIS PLACE. SO THANK YOU CHAIRMAN CHAO PRIVACY CONSUMER PROTECTION COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS OUT OF OUT OF GAS AND OF I'M THE POLICY MANAGER AT THE CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH. I'M HERE TO URGE THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY NINE NINETY EIGHT TO PROTECT CHILDREN FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES FROM TOXIC FOR MATERNA CHEMICALS OF SERVE NO EFFECTIVE PURPOSE AND FURNITURE MATTRESSES AND CHILDREN'S PRODUCTS. FOR OVER TEN YEARS THE SENATE FROM BY MENTAL HEALTH HAS BEEN WORKING TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM THE PROVEN HEALTH THREATS OF TOXIC FOR RETURNING CHEMICALS. AND OVER THOSE TEN YEARS WE HAVE SEEN THE FOLLOWING PATTERN. SCIENTISTS DOCUMENT UNACCEPTABLE HEALTH EFFECTS OF FIRE RETARDANT CHEMICAL. THE CHEMICALS RESTRICTED REGULATED BANTER PHASED OUT BY THE INDUSTRY. THE INDUSTRY PLACES OFTEN RETURN TO CHEMICAL WHAT THE NEW ONE. THEN ALL TOO OFTEN WE DISCOVER THAT THE REPLACEMENT CHEMICAL CAUSES MAJOR HEALTH CONCERNS PROBLEMS SUCH AS REPRODUCTIVE HARM TO BOTH WOMEN AND MEN. DESTRUCTIVE TO THE BODY'S HORMONE SYSTEM DECREASED IQ IN CHILDREN CANCER IMMUNE DISORDERS. INDEED PUREVIEW RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT MANY FLAME RETARDANT CHEMICALS INCLUDING THOSE ADOPTED A SAFER REPLACEMENTS ARE HIGHLY TOXIC TO PEOPLE. MANY OF THESE CHEMICALS FOR EXAMPLE OR GANO HOW'D YOU NEED A FLAME RETARDANTS ARE ADDED TO PRODUCTS THEY MIGRATE INTO THE MIGRATE INTO THE DUST AND WE TO CHRONIC IN HOME EXPOSURE FOR CALIFORNIA FAMILIES. I MUST ALSO NOTE THAT THESE TOXIC FLAME RETARDANT CHEMICALS DISPROPORTIONATE FACT WINNABLE COMMUNITIES. CALIFORNIA'S BUREAU OF HOME FURNISHINGS AND THURMOND SOLUTION HAS PIERCY FOUND THE FLAME RETARDANT CHEMICALS DO NOT PROVIDE MEANINGFUL FIRE SAFETY BENEFIT TO FURNITURE. FURTHERMORE THE CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION WHAT SETS FLAMMABILITY STANDARDS FOR MATTRESSES HAS STATED THAT PLANE RETURNS ARE NOT NEEDED TO MEET STANDARDS ITS STANDARDS. THE BUREAU. RIGHTLY SO REVISED ITS PLAYABILITY STANDARDS PROVIDE FIRE SAFETY WITHOUT THEM RETARDANTS AND EXEMPTED THE JUVENILE PRODUCTS COVERED BY THIS BILL FROM FAME ABILITY STANDARDS. BECAUSE THE PRODUCTS DO NOT POSE A SIGNIFICANT FIRE SAFETY RISK. STUDIES FROM BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND THE UNITED KINGDOM KINGDOM CORROBORATE THESE DECISIONS AND CLEARLY DEMONSTRATE THREE ESSENTIAL FACTS. ONE AS USED A FURNITURE THE CHILDREN'S PRODUCTS THESE TOXIC CHEMICALS DO NOT PROTECT PEOPLE FROM FIRES. THAT IS TO SAY THE LEAST TOXIC CHEMICALS PERFORM NO USEFUL FUNCTION IN THESE PRODUCTS TWO. MANUFACTURES CAN AFFORD WE ME FILM ABILITY TANDARDS WITHOUT THESE CHEMICALS. AND THREE IF THEY PUT OUR FIRST RESPONDERS IN DANGER. THE MAJORITY THESE PRODUCTS MAJORITY OF PRODUCTS IN EACH OF THESE CATEGORIES ARE ALREADY BEING PRODUCED WITHOUT FULLY RETURNED CHEMICALS UNFORTUNATELY A SIGNIFICANT MINORITY OF LAGGARDS IN THESE PRODUCT CATEGORIES CONTINUE TO EXPOSE CALIFORNIANS. TO THESE DANGEROUS CHEMICALS THAT'S WHY AB TWENTY NINE NINETY EIGHT AIMS TO ADDRESS AND THAT'S WHY IT'S NEEDED. I URGE AYE VOTE. ON THIS BILL ARE TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA FAMILY CHILDREN AND OUR COMMUNITIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL WITNESS SORRY SECOND WITNESS. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CONGRESS THE BELMONT BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. OF PLEASE TO BE CO SPONSORS OF THIS MEASURE THEY GO JUST ADD THAT. NOBODY UNDERSTANDS THE SOURCE AND SPREAD OF FIRE BETTER THAN FIREFIGHTERS. BUT EVERY TIME A FIRE FIGHTER PUTS ON A UNIFORM THEY'RE REPRESENTING A PROUD. AND HIGHLY SKILLED PROFESSION. AND THEY DEPEND THEIR LIVES DEPEND ON UNDERSTANDING FIRE BEHAVIOR IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. HOW HE'D ENERGIES TRANSFER DURING EMERGENCY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY HOW TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC? WE AREN'T SCIENTISTS GEMMA BEHIND ME THE EXPERTS BUT WE ARE FIRE BEHAVIOR EXPERTS. AND WHAT WE KNOW IS THERE IS NO UTILITY FOR THESE CHEMICALS IN THESE PRODUCTS THERE IN THIS BILL. A THEY BRING HARM TO FIREFIGHTERS AND WHEN THEY WHEN THEY BURNED AND THEY BRING HARM TO THE PUBLIC. SO THE CLEAR CONCLUSION AS THE RISK IS NOT WORTH THE HARM. IT BRINGS TO THE PUBLIC SO WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. EXACTLY MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS GREG HAYES HERE ON BEHALF OF THE TERRACE SYSTEMS THEY ARE WE MAKE IT NON TOXIC A FLAME RETARDANT SHALL. I THAT IS SAFE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AND WE ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I THINK IMAGE NEXT PLACE. GOOD AFTERNOON MORTON CARB ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY GROUP ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA ALISON SPORT THANK YOU EXPERTISE. GENEVIEVE AVEDON ON BEHALF OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS OF THE BILL AND SUPPORT. ADDITIONALLY THE SEPT FIVE DRYERS INSTITUTE SEVENTH GENERATION ADVISORS AND PLASTIC. POLLUTION COALITION ALL IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU MATCH NEXT PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MOST EMMA WITH SHOT YOUR ENTRY ON BEHALF OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU NEXT PLACE. DANIEL SILVINO ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. I ALREADY HEN AND PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES WITH THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC INTEREST RESEARCH GROUP CALPERS ALSO IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU THANKS PLACE. PALLETS ALANIZ FELONIES GROUP ON BEHALF OF VOICE FOR CHOICE ADVOCACY AND SUPPORT AT U. NEXT PLACE. AND WHAT ABOUT SOME OF ON BEHALF OF CLEAN WATER ACTION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. SO THIS TIME LIKE INVITA TO THE TASK OF OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS N TIM'S CHEST ACHE WITH AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL I. APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO. SHARE OUR CONCERNS WITH THE BILL AS DRAFTED. I'M OUR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL IS CENTERED AROUND THREE. PRIMARY POLICY ISSUES. NECESSITY. THE IMPACT AND INNOVATION OF FIRE SAFETY. AND THE UNDERLYING BASIS FOR SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR THE BILL I'M GONNA TOUCH ON A COUPLE OF THESE AND AND THEN ASK DR THOMAS MIGHT STOP FOR HIS HIS COMMENTS. OF FIRST THE DEFINITION OF OF WINTERTIME CHEMICAL NOT BILL. IN OUR VIEW WOULD NOT ONLY RESTRICT THE USE OF THOSE WOMEN TOWARDS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ON THE MARKET TODAY. BUT WAS TRICKED THE USE OF ANY FLAME RETARDANT. DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE. INCLUDING THOSE SENTENCES THAT HAVE NOT YET EVEN BEEN CONTEMPLATED. THE BILL DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE RICK GARZA THEIR CHEMICAL COMPOSITION HAS A PROPERTIES ANY POTENTIAL LOOKS EXPOSURE YOU COULD. INDUSTRY TO CREATE THE GREENEST MOST SUSTAINABLE OF EFFICIENT CHEMISTRY. THAT WOULD APPLY TO FLAME* PROPERTIES. AND THAT BILL WOULD BE THAT THAT CHEMISTRY WOULD BE PROHIBITED UNDER THIS BILL. THERE'S CONVERSATION EARLIER ABOUT FIRE SAFETY STANDARDS IN THE STATE AND GENERALLY SPEAKING FIRE STANDARDS PRESCRIBED MATERIAL OR PRODUCT TEST THAT MEASURES FIRE PERFORMANCE. IN TERMS OF IGNITION RELEASE HEAT RELEASE FLAME SPREAD ECCENTRIC. THOUGH SANDERS DON'T NECESSARILY PRESCRIBE. HOW TO ACHIEVE THOSE DESIRED OUTCOMES AND AND IT IS TRUE THAT% THE STATE SPAM ABILITY STANDARD? ONLY ACCOUNTS FOR FURNITURE TEST FOR SMOLDERING IGNITION SOURCES LIKE CIGARETTES. DOES NOT AND THAT THEREFORE DOES NOT DEMAND THE USE OF THESE CHEMISTRIES HOWEVER SOME MANUFACTURES MAY FEEL. THAT THERE IS STILL VALUE IN USING THIS CHEMISTRIES TO IMPROVE SMOLDERING RESISTANCE OR PROVIDE ADDITIONAL PRODUCT SAFETY AGAINST SMALL OPEN FLAMES LIKE CANDLES. OR DECREASE THE RATE OF FIRE DEVELOPMENT WHEN FURNITURE IGNITES THIS BILL WOULD MAKE THAT IMPOSSIBLE. SECONDLY BRIEFLY THE STATE IS HOME TO A UNIQUE REGULATORY PROGRAM THAT'S OPERATED BY THE DEPARTMENT TOXICS. I CAN SAY FOR CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM REQUIRES DTS HE TO ESTABLISH A PROCESS TO IDENTIFY PRIORITIZE. EVALUATE AND IF NECESSARY REGULATE CHEMICALS THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY. TO RESTRICT THOSE. IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT USES IN OUR VEW WE BELIEVE THAT THIS REGULATORY PROGRAM IS THE MORE APPROPRIATE VENUE. FOR DISCUSSING THESE COMPLEX SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS. FINALLY OF THE STATE'S EXISTING FURNITURE LABELING LAW ALREADY REQUIRES A LABEL ON RESIDENTIAL FURNITURE INFORMING CONSUMERS WHETHER OR NOT AND I DON'T CONTAINS A FLAME RETARDANT CHEMICAL. CONSUMERS HAVE THE ABILITY TODAY TO CHOOSE PRODUCTS THAT CONTAIN FLAME RETARDANTS ARE NOT WE BELIEVE THIS LEGISLATION DISCOURAGES INNOVATION. ARTIFICIALLY LIMITS CONSUMER CHOICE AND UNNECESSARILY RESTRICTS THE ABILITY OF MANUFACTURERS TO USE THESE FIRE SAFETY CHEMISTRIES IF THEY CHOSE TO DO SO. AS A FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE WOULD URGE THE COMMITTEE TO OPPOSE THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM THANK YOU. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS WHEN HIS PLEASE THANK YOU VERY MUCH OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO THIS AFTERNOON MY NAME IS THOMAS BETTS BY WAY OF BACKGROUND HAVE APPEASED AND TALKS COLLEGE A. THE WORKING IN THE FIELD FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS I'M BOARD CERTIFIED IN THE UNITED STATES AND ALSO REGISTER AS A SEX CAO JUST IN EUROPE. AND HERE AT THE REQUEST OF BCC I JUST WANT TO PROVIDE A PERSPECTIVE REALLY ON TWO OR THREE POINTS ONE. NOT ALL FLAME RETARDANTS ARE CREATED EQUAL IN AS A TOXICOLOGIST I'VE TAKEN A LOOK AT THE VARIETY OF FLAME RETARDANTS ACROSS VARIOUS CHEMICAL CLASSES AND SOME SICK SERIOUSLY. CLEARLY ARE MORE SERIOUS. UP POTENTIAL HAS RISEN RISKS AND OTHERS AND I THINK AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS WAS ANALYZED BY THE DESIGN FOR ENVIRONMENT PROGRAM OF THE US EPA ABOUT THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN THEY PUBLISHED A. A LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVES TO FLEXIBLE POLYURETHANE FOAM THEY HAD AS SPECTRUM OF OF SAFETY IN ENVIRONMENT PROFILES AS WELL SO I THINK LOOKING AT THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT THING TO DO AS THAN GROUPING THEM ALL TOGETHER I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND. THAT THE TEMPTATION TO DO THAT AND YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF A WHOLE AREA AT ONCE BUT MANY OF THINGS YOU MAY END UP. BANNING ARE ONES WHICH WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE AND COULD PROVIDE A BENEFIT AGAIN BENEFITS NOT MY AREA BILL THE STANDPOINT OF RISK I THINK THE RISK IS. IS MIDDLE FOR SOME OF THOSE CHEMICALS IN CERTAIN USES. AND SECOND OF ALL WITH REGARD TO FIREFIGHTERS IT'S AN EERIE I TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY OFTEN I'LL GET ASKED. QUESTIONS BY COMPANIES IF WE DO THE FOLLOWING WITH THIS IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF THE PUBLIC OR OF USERS OR PEOPLE DOWNSTREAM FROM THE A A CHEMICAL. AND IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN A LOOK AT THE FIREFIGHTERS SURE LOOKED AT VERY CAREFULLY THE CLEARLY IS AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. WHEN IT COMES TO CANCER THERE'S NUMBER OF SLAVES ISSUE INCREASING CANCER A PROBABLY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT WAS ONE DONE BY NINE ASH WHICH IS PUBLISHED THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO. LOOKING AT THIRTY THOUSAND CANCER IF. THE CITY FIREFIGHTERS AND THE EX IS SO INCREASES IN SEVERAL TYPES TYPES OF CANCER. RESPIRATORY CANCER WHICH THEY ASCRIBE TO EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS BECAUSE IT'S IT'S KIND OF CANCER ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. THEY NEVER MENTION FLAME RETARDANTS BUT THEY DID MENTION. THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HAZARDOUS EXPOSURES AND THIS GOES INCLUDING ASBESTOS AND DIESEL EXHAUST FEELS AWESOME ANOTHER THING WHICH UP FIREFIGHTERS ARE EXPOSED PARTICULAR BACK IN THE. IN THE FIREHOUSE THE THIS IS QUOTING FROM IT THE NATIONAL BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE HAVE EXPOSURES AND HEAVIEST BUSES AND DIESEL EXHAUST. AND DIGESTIVE CANCERS APPEAR SMALL COMPARED TO EFFECTS OF OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS DIET WILL BE SEE FIELDS GOT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TOBACCO USE AND ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION WE FOUND SIMILAR RISK FOR ORAL FEARING SHE'LL ILLYRIAN SHE'LL. WHICH UPPER RESPIRATORY CANCERS COMPARED THE US POPULATION SIMILAR TO JUST OF CANCERS RISK FACTORS POLICE AYE TO TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION WITH LESSER EVIDENCE THAT EXPOSURE TO WOOD DUST SMOKE. ASBESTOS POLY AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS WHICH ARE FOUND IN SMOKE AND ACID MISS MAY INCREASE THE RISK THERE'S NO MENTION OF FLAME RETARDANTS. SO I THINK THERE ARE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED WITH REGARD TO FIREFIGHTERS IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH I DON'T THINK THIS WOULD HELP AT ALL. ONE THING I THINK WOULD HELP IN THIS IS GETTING THE AREA OF INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE ARE THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE CANCER FIREFIGHTER. FIREFIGHTER CANCER SUPPORT NETWORK MAYBE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH SOME OF THOSE MOST OF THOSE RELATE TO HYGIENE. DEALING WITH TURNOUT GEAR CLINICAL EQUIPMENT VERY PRACTICAL THINGS WHICH COULD BE DONE TOMORROW THEY DON'T REQUIRE PRODUCTS TO BE BANNED IN. THE OVERTIME REMOVED IN THE MARKET IT DOESN'T REQUIRE COMPLEX REGULATORY FRAMEWORK BUT I MEAN AS IN MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE OF EXPOSURE FIREFIGHTERS TO CARCINOGENS IMMEDIATELY. THAT SOMETHING THAT IT DEFTLY TAKES TRAINING IT TAKES MONEY AND ENERGY BUT I THINK THAT WOULD CLEARLY BENEFIT THE FIREFIGHTERS CERTAINLY MORE THAN THIS BILL WOULD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ANY HACKMAN I'M HERE ON BEHALF THE JUVENILE PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION REPRESENT EVERYTHING FROM CRIBS TO STROLLERS TO CAR SEATS. WE ARE CONCERNED WITH AB TWO TWENTY NINE NINETY EIGHT. UNLESS IT'S AMENDED. SAFETY IS OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY WE DON'T MAKE PRODUCTS AND PROVIDE THEM TO CONSUMERS FOR USE WITH INFANTS AND JUVENILES. UNLESS WE BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE SAFE AND WE HAVE BEEN A LEADING INDUSTRY AND REMOVING FLAMER TURNS WHEN THEY'RE NOT NECESSARY WE WORK FOR THE STATE ON TV ONE SEVENTEEN AS MENTIONED BY ONE A SUPPORTERS US LEGISLATION. TO EXCLUDE JUVENILE PRODUCTS THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO INTENTIONALLY ADD ADD THOSE FLAME RETARDANTS. HOWEVER. THERE ARE TWO SPECIFIC INSTANCES OF THIS BILL RECOGNIZES THAT WE'RE MANDATED TO USE FLAME RETARDANTS EITHER TO ME TO YOU WELL STANDARD FOR SAFETY FOR ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS OR FOR CAR SEATS BEGIN THE BILL ADDRESSES BOTH OF THOSE ISSUES. WERE ASKING THAT THERE BE UNIFORM STATEWIDE STANDARD WITH REGARD TO THIS ISSUE. SAN FRANCISCO'S MOVE FORWARD IN THIS AREA AND THEIR THEIR BILL SPECIFICALLY DIFFERS WITH THIS LEGISLATION AND WE'RE HOPEFUL WE CAN HAVE A UNIFORM STATEWIDE STANDARD. SO AGAIN. WE WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE SPONSORS OFFICE IN MY COURAGE BECAUSE IT ALSO. LOOK FOR STATEWIDE UNIFORMITY ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD. YOUR NAME. THANK YOU MISCALCULATION OBSOLETE. I'M HERE TODAY FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SLEEP PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION. WERE NATIONAL TRADE ASSOCIATION THAT REPRESENTS MATTRESS MANUFACTURERS. NOW WE AGREE WITH MR BLOOM IN THE PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL OUT WE DON'T WANT TO TAKE TO THAT. THAT THAT THERE ARE BAD THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY QUICK THAT THERE ARE BAD CHEMICALS THAT SHOULD BE OUTLAWED. THE PROBLEM IS THE WAY HE DEFINES CHEMICALS IN THIS BILL. WHICH SAYS THAT. FIRE RETARDANT CHEMICAL MEANS ANY CHEMICAL THE CONTRIBUTES TO RETURNING FIRE. IS SO BROAD THAT COMPLETELY INERT THINGS LIKE SAND SILICA WHICH WE DO USE OUR MATTRESSES WE CAN'T USE UNDER HIS BILL. SO THE DILEMMA PUTS THE MATTRESS MANUFACTURES AND IS THAT. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY DON'T USE THE BROMINATED FIRE RETARDANT CITIES CONCERNED ABOUT OF THEIR CANDLE HALOGENS OR SOME OF THESE OTHER CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS FOR THE PROBLEMS. EVEN THE BENIGN COMPOUNDS THAT WE MUST USE TO MEET FEDERAL OPEN FLAME STANDARDS AND TO MEET FEDERAL SMOLDERING CIGARETTE STANDARDS WE CAN'T USE THE BENIGN UP A CHEMICAL STRATEGIES. UNDER HIS BILL SO IF HIS BILLS ENACTED THE WAY IT IS TODAY. WE CAN'T MEET THE FEDERAL STANDARD. AND IF WE USE THE PRODUCTS THAT WE NEED TO MEET THE FEDERAL STANDARD THAT WE CAN'T MEET MISTER BLOOM STANDARD THIS IN TWENTY NINE NINETY EIGHT. SO THIS BILL IT'S IT SOUNDS GREAT TO GET BAD CHEMICALS OUT OF FURNITURE MATTRESSES WERE ALL FOR THAT. WE DON'T HAPPEN TO USE THOSE AND THE BUT NINE CHEMICALS THAT WE DO USE WOULD BE COMPLETELY OUTLAWED BY THIS BILL SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO REACH SOME SORT OF CONCLUSION. UP RA OF RESOLUTION ON THAT A ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL SALES OF MATTRESSES WON'T HAPPEN IN THE STATE THE DATE STATE GENERAL FUND TO GIVE IT TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT EIGHTY MILLION A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO GET. IT TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS YOUR TAX REVENUE WILL LOSING. AND THE HOUSES OF JOBS AS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THERE. NEXT PLACE FOR YOURSELF OF OKAY THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN JOHN CABOT TECH ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS CALIFORNIAN OPPOSITION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MARGARET CLAD SAMBA HAVE TO CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION. BUT HER IMAGE THANKS PLACE. MELISSA WARNER ON BEHALF OF THE RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION RETURN MATCH. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION SCENE AND UP BRING BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. A MISTAKE IS BAKER. IN AND I. IT IT'S REALLY GOING TO THE DEFINITION OF FLAME RETARDANT. AND SEEN WHAT JUST HOW BROAD IT IS IN MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO NARROW IT TO WHAT IS HARMFUL. AS AND STILL HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO ALLOW WHAT MIGHT. WITH TECHNOLOGY OR OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO BE HELPFUL. IS PARA NEVER NEVER FIND FIND IN THE CRIB FIND THE MATTRESS FINDING ALL THE EQUIPMENT AND WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT. OVER THE LIFE OF MY KIDS NOTHING IN THERE IS CREATING THAT DASTAN CREATING THAT. ETHER WHATEVER THAT WE WANT THEM TO HAVE BUT I DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BREADTH OF THE TERM FLAYED RETURN IT AND WONDER IF THE AUTHOR MIGHT. SHARE PERSPECTIVE ON HOW. AND THAT IS NOT OVERRIDE. WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON LANGUAGE WITH OPPOSITION WERE HAPPY THAT LISTEN TO THEIR SUGGESTIONS BUT SO FAR WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO COME TO AGREEMENT I BELIEVE MISTER COUSIN OVER MAY BE ABLE TO. SHED MORE LIGHT ON THAT YEAH I THINK. TO ECHO THOSE THAT COMMENT WOULD MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH. SEE PRODUCT ASSOCIATION ON ONE THING WE WOULD LIKE IS FOR MORE INFORMATION ARM WE UNDERSTAND THE U. CELICA I'M WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO KNOW IF TO USE IN ANY OTHER TYPE OF FIBERS OF FABRIC SO THEY MAY BE. CONSIDER FLAME RETARDANT CHEMICALS ARM AND SO WE WERE JUST WAITING ON THAT INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN LOOK AT IT EVALUATING SEE WHAT KIND OF LANGUAGE WE CAN CREATE A WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE. I'M BUT WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED THAT. IT IT'S HARD TO DRAFT LANGUAGE WHEN WE DON'T KNOW THE SUBSTANCES WERE TALKING ABOUT AND I ALSO LIKE TO ADD THAT THE FLIGHT RETURNING DEFINITION THAT'S CURRENTLY IN STATUTE HAS BEEN IN STATURE FOR FIVE YEARS AND MANY INDUSTRIES HAVE COMPLIED WITH THINK CONTINUE TO COMPLY WITH IT. YEAH I THINK YOU. KNOWING THAT THINGS KEEP MOVING ALONG WE KEEP CHANGING I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT OF A BRIDE. THAT'S MY PRIMARY CONCERN WITH DESI I APPRECIATE THE INTENT AND THEM THINK FOR THE ANSWERS. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEEING NONE. FIRST ELECTED TO HOUSE BOTH SIDES IS TO RELEASE AFTER TODAY'S HEARING IS TO REALLY SIT DOWN AND TRY TO WORK ON THE DEFINITION A LITTLE BIT. LA I DO AGREE THAT THAT IT MAY HAVE TO BE FINE TUNED SLIGHTLY. WE DON'T I'M SURE THE AUTHOR DOES WANT TO INCLUDE EVERYTHING IN SIGHT SO I'M SO I'M GONNA ASK MAKE THAT THE OZ RIGHT NOW OPPOSE ISIS IT DOWN. AND WORK IT OUT. HAVING SAID THAT. I THINK AS FAR AS FAR AS THE. THE ISSUE REGARDING THE TSC. I THINK IDEALLY I WOULD AGREE THAT THE TSC WOULD BE GUARANTEED TO THE MOST IDEALS. ENTITY TO DO IT BUT IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THEY ARE SORT OF RESOURCES US ALSO TO QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT WE WANT TO WAIT TILL DTS SEATED TO GET GET INVOLVED. OR OR DO WE WANT TO TAKE ACTION ALL IN LIGHT OF THAT THE BODY OF RESEARCH THAT'S OUT THERE THAT INDICATES THAT THAT THESE CHEMICALS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE. AND ARE NOT NEEDED AS I AS WE HEARD EARLIER. AND YOU KNOW HOW WE CAN ADJUST TO SIT SIT BACK AND DO NOTHING I MEAN YOU KNOW MY FEELING IS NOW WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING. SO. IN LIGHT OF THE YOU KNOW THE POTENTIAL HARM THAT COULD CAUSE CHILDREN AND FIREFIGHTERS AND THE LIKE AND AND THAT'S WHY I'M I WANT TO HAVE I WANNA SEE THIS. BILL MOVE FORWARD BUT THAT I YOU KNOW I WANT TO REPEAT THE FACT THAT I WANT TO ASK YOU GUYS TO SIT DOWN AND WORK IT OUT. TO THAT. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AMBER'S. MISTER SHE HE AND A NUMBER OF THE OTHER FOLKS WHO'VE TESTIFIED KNOW THAT. I'M MORE THAN WILLING TO SIT DOWN AND HASH OUT DETAILS OF BILLS AND I MAKE THAT COMMITMENT TO YOU AND THE COMMITTEE AS WE MOVE FORWARD NINE. I CAN'T PROMISE OF RESOLUTION BUT I'M HOPEFUL THAT WILL REACH ONE AND SAID THANK YOU VERY MUCH I RECALL. BILLS REMOVED. DO I HAVE A SECOND. AND SECOND AT THEIR LOCAL PLEASE. AB.

MISS IRWIN WHICH LIKE GOPHERS SO WHAT YOU WANT TO GO NEXT LOCAL LAST. OKAY THATCHERISM. AND THAT IS ITEM. NUMBER ELEVEN THAT'S TWENTY FIVE FIFTY SIX ON CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION. CROWDFUNDING. SO. ANYTIME YOU'RE READY YOU MAY I SEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS A. B. TWO FIVE FIVE SIX IS A BILL THAT WILL MODERNIZE OUR STATE LAWS REGARDING CHARITABLE GIVING. TODAY CHARITABLE FUNDRAISING IS DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS TEN YEARS AGO. NOW IT'S COMMONPLACE HAVE CHARITY DRIVES DONE COMPLETELY ONLINE CROWD FUNDING FOR CHARITABLE GIVING IS BECOMING THE NORM. AND OUR LAWS HAVE NOT KEPT UP WITH THESE. TRENDS AB TWO FIVE FIVE SIX WILL UPDATE CALIFORNIA'S CHARITABLE GIVING LAWS TO ENSURE THAT ONLINE GIVING PLATFORMS ARE OPERATING WITHIN THE INTENT OF THE LAW. AND THAT DONORS AND CHARITIES ARE PROTECTED. I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE WORKING WITH ME ON THE AMENDMENTS AND I WILL COMMIT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE AG'S OFFICE WHICH HAS BEEN PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TODAY HAVE A. REPRESENTATIVE FROM PAYPAL TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELCOME IN THE YOU MAY. PROCEED. I'M OCT AYE DAUGHTER MUCH IS SENIOR DIRECTOR OF PAYPAL AND PRODUCT MANAGEMENT. I ALSO SERVE AS OUR HEAD OF GLOBAL BECAUSE RELATED PRODUCTS. ON BEHALF OF PAY PAL AND PAY PAL CHARITABLE GIVING FUND SHALL CALL PPG F. I'M HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWO FIVE FIVE SIX. PVDF IS ITSELF A FIVE ONE C. THREE CHARITY AND A SEPARATE LEGAL ENTITY FROM PAYPAL. JEFF PARTNERS WITH PAYPAL TO OFFER A CHARITABLE GIVING PROGRAM WHERE DONORS CAN BROWSE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CHARITIES AND PAYPAL'S ONLINE CAUSE HUB. DONATIONS TO THE CAUSE OF ARE MADE TO PPG F. WHICH IS ISSUES A TAXI TO THE DONOR. WHEN A DONOR MAKES A DONATION HERE SHE CHOOSES A CHARITY FOR PEOPLE YOU HAVE TO READ GRANT THE FUNDS TO. RIGHT NOW. DONORS CAN ONLY CHOOSE FROM THOUSANDS OF CHARITIES THAT ARE ENROLLED PPG HALF. PEOPLE JEFF LIKE TO BE ABLE TO OFFER DONORS THE OPTION TO SUPPORT NOT JUST ENROLLED CHARITIES IN THE CAUSE OF BUT VIRTUALLY ANY CHARITY THAT IS IN GOOD STANDINGWITH THE IRS ANOTHER REGULATORS. PAYPAL COVERS ALL TRANSACTION FEES IN THE CAUSE OF TO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF DONORS DONATION GOES TO THE RECOMMENDED CHARITY. PAYPAL ALSO OFFERS PROMOTIONS DURING CERTAIN TIMES OF THE YEAR WHERE CONTRIBUTES AN ADDITIONAL MATCHING PERCENTAGE THE DONATION TO CHARITY. LAST YEAR THROUGH THE BECAUSE HARDEN PPG UPS OTHER BUSINESS PARTNERS PDGF RAISED. OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR OVER TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CHARITIES. INTERNET ENABLED TITLE GIVEN IS A GROWING PART OF THE CHARITABLE SECTOR DONORS VALUE THE CONVENIENCE OF AN ONLINE BASED PLATFORM AND WE WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE FROM A BROAD ARRAY OF CHARITIES. WHILE CHARITABLE GIVING WAS ALMOST FLAT OVERALL FROM JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN. GIVING VIA INTERNET PLATFORMS IS UP THIRTEEN PERCENT OVER THE SAME TIME PERIOD. ASSEMBLY BILL TWO FIVE FIVE SIX CREATES AN IMPORTANT EXEMPTION FOR ONLINE CHARITABLE GIVING PLATFORMS LIKE PPG OFF ALLOWING THEM. WHEN A NUMBER OF CONDITIONS ARE SATISFIED TO OFFER POTENTIAL DONORS THE OPPORTUNITY TO DONATE TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ADDITIONAL CHARITIES THAT HAVE NOT YET ENROLLED CHARITABLE GIVING PLATFORM. IN OUR EXPERIENCE WHEN DONORS CAN CONNECT TO A GREATER RANGE OF CHARITIES THEY'RE BOTH MORE LIKELY TO GIVE AND GIVE MORE GENEROUSLY. UNDER THE CURRENT LAW. THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF A CHARITY AS NECESSARY TO INCLUDE ANY CHARITY IN THE ONLINE DATABASE IS A POTENTIAL RECIPIENT OF A DONATION. PVDF WOULD THEREFORE HAVE TO OBTAIN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF WRITTEN CONSENTS TO LIST ADDITIONAL CHARITIES ON THE COST OF INCLUDING FROM CHARITIES THAT MIGHT BE LESS IN THE DATABASE BUT NEVER BE SELECTED FOR A DONATION. WHO WERE EXPAND THE OPTIONS BEYOND THE EMERALD CHARITIES? THIS BILL WOULD ELIMINATE THE WRITTEN CONSENT REQUIREMENT PLATFORM MEET CERTAIN CONDITIONS THEREBY VASTLY EXPANDING NUMBER OF CHARITIES THAT RECEIVED DONATIONS. THE BILL CONTAINS IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS FOR BOTH DONORS AND RECIPIENT CHARITIES. OR CHARITIES ONLINE PLATFORMS ONLY BE ABLE TO LIST OTHERWISE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION ABOUT A CHARITY AND MUST PROVIDE A MECHANISM FOR PROMPT REMOVAL FROM PLATFORM TO CHARITIES REQUEST. THESE PLATFORMS MUST ALSO PROVIDE DONATIONS WITHIN A SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD TO BENEFITING CHARITIES. ALONG WITH AN ACCOUNTING OF ANY FEES IMPOSED. FOR DONORS THE BILL REQUIRES THESE ONLINE PLATFORMS RIGHT IMPORTANT VETTING FUNCTION BY LISTING ONLY CHARITIES IN GOOD STANDING WITH THE IRS AND CALIFORNIA REGULATORS. AND SAFEGUARDS DONORS PERSONAL INFORMATION BY SEVEN RESTRICTIONS ON WHEN AND HOW DONOR DATA CAN BE SHARED WITH BENEFITING CHARITIES. THE BILL ALSO SETS FORTH A NUMBER OF REQUIRED DISCLOSURES THAT PLATFORMS MUST MAKE QUALIFY FOR THE EXEMPTION. THERE ARE WELL OVER A HUNDRED. EXCUSE ME THERE WELL OVER A MILLION CHARITIES IN GOOD STANDING WITH THE IRS AND THE BILL'S EXEMPTION PROVIDES A PRACTICAL METHOD. ENABLING CERTAIN QUALIFYING PLATFORMS TO LIST A WIDE ARRAY OF CHARITIES WITHOUT A TIE OBTAINING PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT FROM EACH. THIS PROVISION WILL UNDOUBTEDLY INCREASE DONOR CHOICE IN OVERALL TITLE GIVING WHILE PROTECTING CHARITIES AND DONORS FROM ABUSE. DISASTER RELIEF IS ONE TANGIBLE EXAMPLE OF WHERE THE ABILITY TO LIST CHARITIES WITHOUT OBTAINING PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT IS CRITICAL. SMALLER LOCAL CHARITIES THAT COULD BENEFIT FROM DONATIONS JOINT DISASTERS TYPICALLY HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED CONSENT TO A PLATFORM. THE BILL WOULD ALLOW US ANOTHER PLATFORM TO ROUTE DONATIONS TO SUCH CHARITIES QUICKLY AND WITHOUT GETTING CONSENT FROM THEM AT TIMES WHEN THEY ARE ENGAGED IN THEIR IMPORTANT WORK. I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MANY MEMBERS GREG HAZEM HAPPENED TECHNET AND SUPPORT A VERY MUCH A NICE PLACE. GIVEN THE KILLINGS INTERNET ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU OPPOSITION PLEASE COME ON UP. WELCOME CAN OFTEN CHAIR MEMBERS BLACK SHEPHERD REPRESENTING THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY FOUNDATIONS WE ARE A TRADE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING. THIRTY TWO COMMUNITY FOUNDATION MEMBERS ACROSS THE STATE OUR POSITION CURRENTLY IS CONCERNED WE HAVE A DETAILED LETTER THAT WE SUBMITTED TO THE AUTHOR AND THE COMMITTEE. WE WENT I THINK IS A MEMBER IRWIN FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE YOU KNOW THIS IS IMPORTANT. I'M GOING TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL AND ULTIMATELY OUR GOAL IS TO ENSURE THAT THAT DONOR. THAT DONOR INTENT IS HONORED AND THAT GIVING PRACTICES ADHERE TO THE HIGHEST ETHICAL STANDARDS SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH AN EX WHEN HIS PLACE. AYE AYE GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS JENNIFER FEARING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF NONPROFITS WHERE I STATEWIDE POLICY ALLIANCE. OF MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND ORGANIZATIONS AND THE VOICE OF CALIFORNIA'S NONPROFIT COMMUNITY AND SOME ARE AT TO MY COLLEAGUES ARE ARE LETTER THAT WE SUBMITTED IS. A ALSO ONE JUST EXPRESSING CONCERN WE APPRECIATE THE OUTREACH THAT PAYPAL AND IS A MEMBER IRWIN HAVE DONE TO INCLUDE US IN THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS BILL BUT. AS ARTICULATED IN THE LETTER WE HAVE ONGOING CONCERNS THE BIGGEST ONE OF WHICH SIMILAR TO MR BIRD IS AT RELATES TO CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE DONATIONS DIRECTED BY A DONOR TO A PARTICULAR NONPROFIT USING THE CROWDFUNDING PLATFORM. ARE DETERMINED BY THE PADS ON ARE NOT TO BE TRANSFERABLE FROM ONE REASON RATHER TO THAT. NONPROFIT THE FREE MARKET IN THE BILL CURRENTLY PROPOSES THAT CONSPICUOUS JUST COST DISCLOSURE TO THE DONOR THAT THE NONPROFIT MIGHT NOT RECEIVE THE CONTRIBUTION IS ADEQUATE. BUT COME ON PROFITS RESPECTFULLY DISAGREES WITH THAT WE BELIEVE IT ANYONE SOLICITING FUNDS FOR A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION SHOULD BE COMMITTED TO PROCESSES THAT ENSURE THE DONORS DESIGNATIONS ARE PRIORITIZE. AND OR THE DONORS ARE GIVEN OPTIONS IF THEIR DONATION CAN'T BE COMPLETED FOR SOME REASON AND PAYPAL HAS CONVEYED IN OUR CONVERSATIONS THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE INFREQUENT. SO IT SEEMS POSSIBLE AND NOT OVERLY BURDENSOME TO DEVELOP A PROCESS THAT DOESN'T ALLOW CROWD FUNDERS TO INDEPENDENTLY CHOOSE ALTERNATIVE CHARITIES WITHOUT THE DONORS AND PUT. OUR OUR TO OTHER CONCERNS RELATE TO HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE THE CROWDFUNDING PLATFORM TO TRANSFER THE FUNDS FROM THE DONOR ON TO THE ORGANIZATION. AND THE NEED FOR A CLEARER DEFINITION OF OF CROWDFUNDING SOLICITOR FOR CHARITABLE PURPOSE THAT IN PARTICULAR IDENTIFIES WHETHER DONOR ADVISED FUNDS OR GIVING CIRCLES. JUST AS EXAMPLES WOULD BE CONSIDERED AS CROWDFUND ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS SO WE DEFINITELY AGREE THAT CALIFORNIA LAW HASN'T KEPT PACE WITH OPPORTUNITIES. FOR CHARITABLE FUNDRAISING CREATED BY CUT FUNDING COMPANIES BUT. WE THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD PROCEED WITH CAUTION AND CARE HERE TO ENSURE THAT A VERY WIDE NET IS CAST WITH THE PHILANTHROPIC AND NONPROFIT SECTOR TO ENSURE THAT OPTIONS HERE WEIGHED CAREFULLY. AND ANALYZE TO SORT OF CUT DOWN ON UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SO WE HAVE WORKED WITH A SEMI GOVERNMENT ON CHARITABLE FUNDRAISING RELATED BILLS IN THE PAST AND EXPECT TO STAY. AT THE TABLE WITH HER THE SPONSORS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND AND OTHERS AS A IF YOU CHOOSE TO MOVE THIS BILL FORD SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A ADDITIONAL WITNESSES ARE. IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEEING NONE OF IT SO BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ON MISTER OBERNOLTE HAS A QUESTION. ASSEMBLY WOMAN I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THE BILL I HAVE A COUPLE OF CONCERNS THAT I WANTED TO. MAKE YOU AWARE OF. FIRST OF ALL I THINK THAT. THAT LANGUAGE IN THE BILL NEED SOME CLARIFICATION AND TO START WITH I THINK. THAT YOU NEED TO CLARIFY WHAT YOU MEAN WHEN YOU SAY CHARITABLE PURPOSE. BECAUSE THAT'S NOT DEFINED ANYWHERE IN THE BILL AND. IF YOU ARE REFERENCING WHERE IT'S DEFINED IN DIFFERENT PEER PART OF STATE CODE I THINK THAT YOU ARE EXPLICITLY SAY TERRIBLE PURPOSE AS DEFINED IN SECTION BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH. NOT OR IF YOU WANT TO COME UP WITH YOUR OWN DEFINITION I THINK YOU SHOULD DO WITH THEIR THE SECTION BUT I CERTAINLY SHOULDN'T DON'T THINK THAT YOU SHOULD LEAVE IT UP TO. INTERPRETATION WHAT EXACTLY A CHARITABLE PURPOSE IS. ARM AND IN A BROADER SENSE. I'M CONCERNED THAT. AND BECAUSE THE ADVENT OF CROWDFUNDING LENDS ITSELF TO. A MUCH MORE LOCAL AND SMALL SCALE KIND OF TRANSACTION BETWEEN. DONORS AND CHARITABLE CAUSES THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT AS WE TRY TO PROTECT. THAT RELATIONSHIP THAT WE DON'T STIFLE THAT ACTIVITY AND I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF THING THAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT SO IF I'M. TRYING TO RAISE MONEY BECAUSE I FIND OUT A FRIEND HAS CANCER AND I KNOW THAT HE CAN'T SUPPORT HIS FAMILY. DURING THIS TRYING TIME SO ARE DOES THAT MAKE ME. A. A CROWD FUNDING SOLICITOR WILFRED SOLICITOR FOR CHARITABLE PURPOSE. MY PERHAPS I'M USING A PLATFORM LIKE GO FUND ME OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR PERHAPS I'M DOING IT ON MY OWN. BUT IT SURE SEEMS LIKE THAT'S NOT A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE THE STATE HAS AN INTEREST IN REQUIRING THAT PERSON TO REGISTER WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. IN IN FILE AN ANNUAL REPORT IT AND I HAVE ANOTHER CONCERN. IF YOU ALONG THAT SAME LINE I MEAN I REALIZE IT'S KIND OF A WORST CASE SCENARIO BUT. I MEAN LET'S SAY BECAUSE THAT YOUR BILL SAYS THAT. THAT MAKES ME A CONSTRUCTIVE TRUSTEE OF THAT MONEY THAT I'M. GATHERING I MEAN IF IT TURNS OUT THAT I WAS MISLED MY FRED DOESN'T HAVE CANCER ANY. USE MY MONEY TO GO TAKE A VACATION TO THE CARIBBEAN YOU KNOW DOES THAT MEAN THAT THAT YOU KNOW I HAVE A. A RESPONSIBILITY TO THE DONORS OF THAT MONEY BECAUSE I REPRESENTED THAT HE DID HAVE CANCER I JUST THINK THAT WE NEED SOME SOME LANGUAGE IN THERE TO. TO PROTECT THAT KIND OF SITUATION SO I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT. LET THE EXPERTS AT. ADDRESS THOSE DETAILS BUT A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE THE DETAILS OBVIOUSLY. HAVING AN INDIVIDUAL DO THE CROWD FUNDING FOR TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THAT BELONGS IN THE BILL ARE SHOULD BE EXEMPTED ALSO SO. WE'RE WORKING WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS BILL DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. INTENDED TO DO AND MAYBE YOU CAN COMMENT ON THE SPECIFIC SURE I WE WE SHARE THE SAME POINT OF VIEW THAT EXACTLY AND THAT TYPE OF SITUATION THAT. THIS BILL IS NOT INTENDED TO MAKE THAT INDIVIDUAL. PURSUE S. REGISTERS SO ANY CLARIFICATIONS THAT MAKE THAT MORE CLEAR WE WERE ON THE SAME PAGE WITH. OKAY GREAT ART Y. JUST THINK IN GENERAL AMBIGUITY IS SOMETHING WE TRY TO AVOID AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT KIND OF THE. SITUATION IS. IT IS DOT STIFLED BECAUSE THE THE WORST THING WE COULD ACCOMPLISH IN TRYING TO PROTECT THAT RELATIONSHIP. IS TO DISCOURAGE THE KIND OF GIVING THAT IS NOW OCCURRING WHERE PEOPLE ARE GETTING MORE INVESTED IN THE WELL BEING OF THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THEIR QUINCES IN THEIR AND THEIR FRIENDS. THAT WHICH I THINK IS A VERY HEALTHY THING FOR SOCIETY I WOULD HATE TO PUT A DAMPER ON THAT BUT TO THEM SO THAT A VERY SUPPORT OF THE BILL HAPPY TO SPORTY TODAY. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR. COMMENTS. THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED TO HAVE A SECOND AND SECOND IT. IN OUR. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I JUST WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THESE. DETAILS WE WE DON'T WANT TO LEAVE ANYTHING VEGAS ONE AND UP WITH YOU KNOW AT THE END OF THE PROCESS TO HAVE A BILL THAT'S THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY OF THESE UNINTENDED COSTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT THIS IS ONLY FOR ITS COMMITTEE THE BILL IS GOING THROUGH SO I WILL WITH SUPPORTING IT IS ALSO WITH THAT THE MAN SECRETARY LISA PROCOL PLEASE. AB TWO FIVE FIVE FIX DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. TELL AYE AYE KILEY. AYE BRITAIN BAKER. AYE BERMAN. AYE CALDERON. AYE IRWIN AYE AYE MULLIN. OBERNOLTE. I REYES. I TING. HERE BILL IS OUT I THINK IT'S YOU HAVE SEVENTY EIGHT YEPI VOTES I BELIEVE YOU HAVE A SECOND BILL. THAT IS. ITEMS SIXTEEN TWENTY THE. EIGHTEEN. THIRTEEN. TWENTY EIGHT THIRTEEN THIRTEEN THAT I THIRTEEN. AND. THIS WOULD CODIFY VERBATIM THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT CREATED THE CAL. CALIFORNIA CYBERSECURITY INTEGRATION CENTER ANOTHER BILL. THAT WAS OF. THAT WERE ANOTHER BILL WAS UP PROPOSED LAST YEAR BUT WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR AND THAT AUTHOR IS GOING TO BE A WORKING WITH ME ON THE BILL. OTHER GOVERNORS OF MESSAGE NOTED THAT CAL SEASICK NEEDED MORE TIME FLEXIBILITY TO MATURE INTO ITS MISSION. AS CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON CYBERSECURITY I RECENTLY HELD A JOINT HEARING WITH CHAIR CHAO AND THIS COMMITTEE. AND WE HEARD HOW FAR CAL SEASICK HAD COME ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS SINCE THE GOVERNOR'S VETO. THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO GIVE THE GOVERNOR ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE HIS VISION FOR KELSEY SICK BEFORE HE LEAVES OFFICE. CYBERSECURITY WILL UNFORTUNATELY BE A CONTINUING THREAT FACTOR FOR CALIFORNIA JUST AS MENACING AS FIRES EARTHQUAKES AND FLOODS. OUR STATE DESERVES A PERMANENT RESPONSE CENTER TO MEET THE THREAT AND AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTEEN CAN PROVIDE THAT CERTAINTY TO CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH JOE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF A BILL. CNN OPPOSITION. CNN. QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MR OBERNOLTE GUY AT THANK YOU MISTER OBVIOUSLY VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL DISAPPOINTED THE GOVERNOR VETOED MY BILL LAST YEAR THAT WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME THING. THE. SO IF INDEED YOU DID NOT SUPPORT THE BILL LAST YEAR VOTED AGAINST IN THIS COMMITTEE ON THE FLOOR AND I'M WONDERING WHY WHAT'S CHANGES AT THE IS AT THE CAL CIRCUS. HAS COME A LONG WAY SINCE THEN AND IT CAL SICK HAS COME A LONG WAY SINCE THEN AND IT'S ALSO DISCUSSIONS WITH. YES THEY DIDN'T THINK THEY WERE FAR ENOUGH ALONG TO AND KIND OF PUSH FOR A SOLUTION LIKE THIS. AND WE THINK WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF MATURITY IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR. SO WHAT GIVES YOU CONFIDENCE THAT THE GOVERNOR WILL FEEL DIFFERENTLY ABOUT IT THIS YEAR WELL MAYBE WITH BOTH OF US ON THE BILL PEOPLE AND PRIVATE HAVE SIGNED. OBVIOUSLY A VERY SUPPORTIVE AND I WISH YOU MUCH LUCK. AS MUCH LIKE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I DO RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT. OF MOST OF THE STRUCTURE HAS BEEN IN PLACE. AND OPERATING SMOOTHLY AND I'M ALSO HOPEFUL THAT THE GOVERNOR WAS SIGNED IT THIS TIME AROUND AND MISTER OBERNOLTE IF YOU LIKE TO BE A CO AUTHOR. LUCK WITH THIS. ACTUALLY I THINK I THINK FOR WORKING OUT I'M HOPING TO WORK OF BEING A JOINT AUTHORED BUT WE'LL SEE OKAY VERY GOOD. WITH THAT THE MEN OF SECRETARY PLEASE. WE SPOKE ABOUT. AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTEEN TO PASS TO GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION. CHAO HIGH I KILEY. AYE BAKER. AYE BERMAN. AYE CALDERON. I IRWIN AYE AYE AYE MULAN. OBERNOLTE AYE VARIOUS. ON. EIGHT THEY TO ZERO YOUR BILL IS OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I THINK THAT'S THE U. TWO BILLS AND MISTER OBERNOLTE I THINK YOU HAVE A BILL. THAT WOULD BE ITEM NUMBER NINE AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY FIVE ON VOTER REGISTRATION DATABASE. ANYTIME YOU'RE READY MAKE LIKE MR CHAIRED A COLLEAGUES IN. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN PRESIDENT OBAMA. ESTABLISHED A PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS ADMINISTRATION TO STUDY WAYS IN WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION OF ELECTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES COULD BE DONE MORE EFFICIENTLY. AND IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE COMMISSION RELEASED ITS REPORT AND ONE OF THE PRIMARY RECOMMENDATIONS. WAS THAT STATES GOD COLLABORATE AND ESTABLISH A WAY OF EXCHANGING VOTER INFORMATION TO MAKE SURE THAT VOTER ROLLS WERE ACCURATE. SO. IN RESPONSE TO THAT THE ELECTRONIC REGISTRATION INFORMATION CENTER OR AREA BECAUSE IT'S CALLED WAS CREATED TO TO FACILITATE. AND BE A DEPOT FOR THIS EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION AND IN THE YEARS SINCE THEN TWENTY THREE STATES HAVE JOINED ERIC. UNFORTUNATE CALIFORNIA IS NOT YET ONE OF THEM SO THIS BILL AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY FIVE WOULD AUTHORIZE NOT REQUIRED BUT AUTHORIZES THE SECRETARY OF STATE. TO JOIN CALIFORNIA TO. ERIC I WANT TO. THANK THE. PREVIOUS COMMITTEE FOR THE ROBUST DISCUSSION IN ELECTIONS ABOUT THIS BILL A ONE OF THE PRIMARY CONCERNS THAT WAS RAISED. WAS THE SAFETY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS AND IN THAT COMMITTEE I AGREED TO TAKE AMENDMENTS AND DOUBLE TO USE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT. TO TAKE AMENDMENTS THAT. THAT CLARIFY THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH. THE SECRETARY OF STATE MAY JOIN ERICA ON A READ THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE AGREEING TO A WE'RE GOING TO ADD A SECTION DE THAT SAYS BEFORE JOINING. THE ELECTRONIC REGISTRATION OF FATE INFORMATION CENTER THE SECRETARY OF STATE SHALL REVIEW AND EVALUATE THE ELECTRONIC REGISTRATION INFORMATION CENTER SECURITY PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES. THE SECRETARY OF STATE MAY JOIN THE ELECTRONIC REGISTRATION INFORMATION CENTER ONLY AFTER MAKING A DETERMINATION THAT IT WILL ADEQUATELY PROTECT. ALL OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS DATA SO I AGREE WITH THAT THE COMMITTEE THAT. THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT SO I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THAT AMENDMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. OPPOSITION. AND AFTERNOON MY INGRAM WITH THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA IRRESPECTIVE PHILLY OPPOSE THIS BILL BECAUSE OF THE SIGNIFICANT PRIVACY CONCERNS THAT ARE RAISED BY JOINING ERIC. THE PROVISION OF NON WITHSTANDING ANY OTHER LAW MEANS THAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE WOULD BE SHARING THIS DATA WITH ERIC DESPITE CALIFORNIA'S STRICT PRIVACY STATUTES. THE PLACE EXPLICIT PROHIBITIONS ON SHARING THIS LANGUAGE THAT MEANS CALIFORNIA CAN SHARE WITHOUT THE INDIVIDUAL'S KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT SENSITIVE VOTER FILE MOTOR VEHICLE AND POTENTIALLY OTHER GOVERNMENT DATA. THIS IS DIRECTLY COUNTER TO THE VEHICLE CODE GOVERNMENT CODE AND CIVIL CODE SECTIONS THAT SAY THIS DATA WILL NOT BE SHARED. IT ALSO CONFLICTS WITH ARTICLE ONE SECTION ONE OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION WHICH GUARANTEES THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY. WE THINK THE PROPOSED PRIVACY MMN IS INSUFFICIENT ERICA AS A NON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION CAN CHANGE ITS BYLAWS AT ANY TIME. WITH JUSTIN MAHER VOTE OF THE GOVERNING BOARD WHICH IS MADE UP OF THE MEMBER STATES. MOREOVER RECENT PROBLEMS WITH ERIC HAVE SHOW THE FLAWS WITHIN THE SYSTEM WHEN WISCONSIN JOINED IT. IT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND IN THE FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTEEN PRIMARY. IN MILWAUKEE ALONE APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED RESIDENTS WHO HAD NOT MOVED HAD NONE THE LESS HAD THEIR VOTER REGISTRATIONS DEACTIVATED DUE TO A FLAW IN THE PROCEDURE. PROCESSING THROUGH ERIC ELECTED OFFICIALS THINK THAT THEY'RE OUT WALKING ABOUT THREE THOUSAND VOTERS WERE AFFECTED BY THIS FLAW. WE THINK THIS BILL IS UNNECESSARY CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS SEVERAL VOTER REGISTRATION PROCESS IN PLACE TO STREAMLINE AND CLEAN UP THE REGISTRATION PROCESS. WE'VE STREAMLINED VOTER REGISTRATION AT THE DMV VOTERS CAN AUTOMATICALLY UPDATE THEIR DMB REGISTRATIONS IN OUR COUNTY. AND THE DMV HAS ADAM AT IT I ADDED AUTOMATIC VOTER REGISTRATION WE ALSO ADDED VOTE CAL IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHICH ALLOWS FOR BETTER SHARING BETWEEN OUR FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND THIS WILL BE THE FIRST YEAR. THAT SAME DAY REGISTRATION THAT HAS GONE INTO A FACT WHICH ALLOWS VOTERS TO CLEAN UP THEIR REGISTRATION. THESE REFORMS TO BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY OUT RATHER THAN THIS APPROACH WHICH SHARES ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S VOTER DATA INTO A FLAWED SYSTEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEEING NINE THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED INSECT MISTER CALDERON GO AHEAD QUESTION BIG YOU. AT SOMEONE MEMBER OBERNOLTE. A BIT MAYBE YOU CAN ADDRESS SOMETHING FOR ME I KNOW WITH ERIC THE FIRST. TWENTY STATES THAT JOIN THE SYSTEM MORE ALLOWED. A SEAT AT THE TABLE CALIFORNIA BE ABOUT TWENTY FOUR SO WE WOULDN'T. HAVE COME THIS OVERRIDING VETO POWER REPRESENTATION ON THAT BOARD. AND SO MY CONCERN IS. YOU YOU WHAT IS OUR LEGAL RECOURSE IF WE TURN OVER OUR INFORMATION. AND. GUILT FLORIDA WITH SOMEBODY ELSE DECIDES. SHARE OUR INFORMATION WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AT MY CONCERN IS ALSO THE FACT THAT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW. IS ACTING IN A WAY THAT I DON'T AGREE WITH AND IS SPECIFICALLY TARGETING. YOU KNOW STATES LIKE OURS WHEN IT COMES OR VOTER ROLLS I VOTED FOR THE BILL IN ELECTIONS. BECAUSE I DO AGREE THAT WE NEED WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO UPDATE. ARE VOTER ROLLS AND MAKE SURE THE INFORMATION IS IS AS RELEVANT UP TO DATE IN AND CLEAN BUT ALSO THE SAME TIME WHEN IT WOULDN'T WHEN WE COME TO THIS COMMITTEE WE'RE GETTING THESE PRIVACY ISSUES. I'M JUST CONCERNED WE DON'T HAVE. ANY LEGAL RECOURSE TO PREVENT OUR INFORMATION THAT WE WILLINGLY TURN OVER. WHETHER CHECK BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE OR NOT. TO BE SHARED WITHOUT OUR CONSENT IN THAT WE WOULD HAVE NO ABILITY TO CONTROL THAT ONCE A DECISION HAD BEEN MADE. I COMPLETELY RESPECT THAT CONCERNED. THE ERIC DECLARE IT IS A COMPLETELY SEPARATE ORGANIZATION FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO IT IS NOT A FEDERAL ORGANIZATION IS ORGAN ORGANIZATION. THAT IS OWNED BY AND CONTROLLED BY THE STATES THAT. MAKE UP THE ORGANIZATION SO WE CALIFORNIA SHOULD I JOIN WOULD BECOME A MEMBER OF ERIC NOW YOU'RE CORRECT THAT BECAUSE WE WERE NOT ONE OF THE FIRST TWENTY STATES WE MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. AND UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS A BILL WAS INTRODUCED LAST SESSION THAT WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME AUTHORIZATION THAT WAS HELD IN APPROPRIATIONS AND REALLY COST US THAT OPPORTUNITY HOWEVER HAVING SAID THAT. I AM ONE HUNDRED PERCENT CERTAIN THAT ERIC IS VERY MOTIVATED INCENTIVIZED TO MAKE SURE THAT STATES. ESPECIALLY LARGE STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA HAVE THEIR CONCERNS MET. AND. SO I THINK THAT THEY WOULD PROBABLY BEND OVER BACKWARDS TO MAKE SURE THAT. IF IF WE WERE UNHAPPY WITH THE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY PUT IN PLACE WHICH ARE EXTENSIVE. THAT SHOULD WE IDENTIFY SOMETHING WE WOULD LIKE THEM TO DO I AM VERY CONFIDENT THAT THEY WOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER DOING THAT DOWN IF THE WORST. WERE TO COME TO PLAY TO TO PASS IN THE SITUATION THAT YOU'RE SEE UNFOLDS WHERE WE DISAGREE. WITH SOME WAY THAT THAT DATA IS BEING USED THEY ON OUR I'M I'M SURE THE SECRETARY OF STATE WOULD BE POLICE IN THAT SITUATION AND BRING IT TO OUR ATTENTION. THE AND WE WOULD CORRECT IT AND IF NECESSARY WITHDRAW FROM THE PARTNERSHIP. SO MAYBE. REALLY QUICK SUMMARY. OTHER THAN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT. FOR THE CAKE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHAT WOULD YOU IDENTIFY AS THE SINGLE GREATEST. BENEFIT TO JOINING THE SYSTEM BUT TO ME THIS IS ABOUT CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND IF YOU READ THE PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSIONS REPORT THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA COMMISSIONED ON THAT'S. THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN GOALS OF. OF THEIR IN THEIR IMPROVEMENTS SUGGEST IMPROVEMENTS THE AUTORE PROCESS IS TO GET MORE PEOPLE ENGAGED IN THE PROCESS OF VOTING. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE SELECT SUCH WOULD ALLOW US TO DO THIS MEMBERSHIP. IS TO PROACTIVELY REACH OUT TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE MOVED HERE AND OFFER THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO REGISTER TO VOTE BECAUSE SOMETIMES THAT'S ALL IT'S GOING TO TAKE. TO. TO PUSH SOMEONE OVER THE EDGE AND ACTUALLY ENGAGING IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS IN THE NEW STATE THAT THEY'RE MOVING. SO IF WE CAN ENGAGE THOSE PEOPLE TWO OR THREE OR FOUR YEARS EARLIER THAN WE NORMALLY WHAT I THINK IT'S A HUGE WIN FOR US. AND THAT'S IN ADDITION TO ALL THE OTHER BENEFITS THEY'RE CLEANING UP THE VOTER ROLLS WOULD HAVE. I THINK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMING COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SEEING NONE. I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO CLOSE BUT THE BEFORE I DO THAT I I JUST TELL I'M SKINNER SHARE WITH YOU THAT I I DON'T FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE GOING UP ON THIS AT. THIS BILL. FOR THE. WHEN THE BILL CAME UP LAST TIME LAST YEAR I ALSO STAYED OFF. WASN'T CONCERNED ABOUT THE. THE BILL ITSELF ARE AND AND OUR A AND I THINK THERE ARE ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO HANDLING THIS AND. AND I THINK IT'S BEEN MENTIONED THAT THE WISCONSIN INCIDENT THAT THEY'RE INVOLVED ON DOZENS OF DOZENS OF OUR VOTERS WHO WHO SO INFORMATION WAS PERCHED. SO ITS CONCERN ABOUT THAT AND I WASN'T DIRECTLY IN CONNECTION WITH THE SYSTEM ERIC SO. SO ON YOU KNOW AND IT'S BEEN ALSO MISSION THAT ABOUT THE TO THE BOARD OF A BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE POSSIBILITY THAT CALIFORNIA MAY NOT BE AT THE TABLE SO THAT ALSO CONCERNS ME SO I'M GONNA ALSO SAY STAY OFFTHIS TIME. ON BUT I'M THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED SO. IF THERE ARE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS I'M GONNA HOUSE AMEND SECRETARY TO DO RECALL THAT MISTER CHAIR LOW ON SECOND CLOSE. CLOSE BUT SO SORRY. ABSENT ONE THING I DID WANT TO ADDRESS IN THE CLOTHES WAS TO. TALK ABOUT THAT SITUATION THAT OCCURRED IN WISCONSIN BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S BEEN A MISPERCEPTION THAT THAT WAS BECAUSE OF ERIC'S INVOLVEMENT AND ALTHOUGH THOSE VOTERS WERE IDENTIFIED. THROUGH THE PARTNERSHIP WITH ERIC IT WAS THE STATE OF WISCONSIN WHO ELECTED TO SEND OUT A POSTCARD TO ALL THOSE VOTERS THAT SAID. PLEASE LET US KNOW THAT YOU'RE REALLY HERE OR YOU'LL BE REMOVED AND THE PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T RETURN THE CARD WERE REMOVED FROM THE DATABASE THAT WAS A THAT ACTION THAT WISCONSIN. ELECTED TO TAKE AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD NOT OCCUR HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND ABSENT THAT ACTION BY WISCONSIN THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THEIR PROBLEM WITH THOSE VOTERS SO IS ONE TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT I MEAN ERIC. IS JUST A PURVEYOR OF INFORMATION WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION IS UP TO US NOT UP TO THEM. I AND THE OTHER POINT I WANTED TO MAKE IS I REALLY THIS COMES DOWN TO A QUESTION OF. WHETHER OR NOT YOU AGREE WITH THE RECOMMENDATION OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S COMMISSION IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN BECAUSE ONE OF OUR PRIMARY FINDINGS WAS THAT THE ELECTIONS PROCESS WOULD BE ENHANCED BY STATES GETTING TOGETHER. AND SHARING THIS THIS INFORMATION WITH EACH OTHER BECAUSE IF YOU AGREE WITH THAT. THEN YOU OUGHT TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL AND LET'S WORK TOGETHER IN MAKING SURE THAT THE PRIVACY OF THAT DATA IS PROTECTED I COMMIT. THE SHOULD THIS BILL WILL MOVE FORWARD I WILL WORK WITH ANYONE THAT HAS CONCERNS ABOUT PUTTING APPROPRIATE PRIVACY RESTRICT RESTRICTIONS IN THE BILL BECAUSE I'M HONOR PERCENT CONFIDENT THAT. ERIC WILL. IF IF THOSE PROTECTIONS ALREADY IN PLACE AREN'T ALREADY IN PLACE WILL WORK WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE COMFORTABLE ME IF YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THE COMMISSION. THAT ABSOLUTELY YOU SHOULD VOTE NOR LAYOFF IF YOU AGREE WITH THE COMMISSION. PLEASE VOTE GAS DOWN I WILL COMMIT TO WORKING WITH YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS THOSE PRIVACY CONCERNS SO WITH THAT I WAS WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. BY AS A BILL MOVE WOULD MOVE FORWARD TO APPROPRIATIONS AND PROBABLY ON SUSPENSE AGAIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK IT. A MAN SECRETARY RECALL PLEASE. DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. CHAO NONVOTING NOT VOTING. HIGHLY I'VE AYE BAKER. I BERMAN. AYE CALDERON. IRWIN. MULLIN. OBERNOLTE BY AYE REYES. TING. FOR. YOUR BILL ISN'T ALL LEGAL VOTES THANK YOU. AS WE'RE WAITING FOR MR COOPER TO CHINA'S. I DO HAVE SEVERAL BILLS THAT I'D LIKE TO PRESENT SO AT THIS TIME I TO TURN THE GALA OVER TO MY VICE CHAIR MISGUIDED. THE FILE ORDER YEAH. THANK. BUT I DO WHILE OTHERS. GENNARO. THAT'S A BIG. GOV ALRIGHT WE'RE GOING TO START WITH. ITEM TO THAT IS E. V. EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE. ALRIGHT. HOLY ES SAYS WITNESSES AND THE KING A. OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. FITS ALL I WILL ACCEPT AS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS. OF THE AMENDMENTS LISTED ON PAGES FIVE AND SIX ANY OF THE ANNOUNCES THAT THE AMENDMENTS WILL ESSENTIALLY DO THE FOLLOWING NUMBER ONE. REQUIRE CCR IS TO BEGIN TO IMPLEMENT A SOFTWARE UPDATE WITHIN THREE DAYS OF BECOMING AWARE OF THE VULNERABILITY. AND REQUIRE FULL INSTALLATION OF A SOFTWARE UPDATE WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OUT AS OPPOSED TO TEN DAYS CURRENTLY IN THE BILL. OUR SECOND IT WILL REQUIRE THE USE OF A MITIGATION MEASURES TO A DECREASE THAT RISK OF A BREACH AND NUMBER THREE EMPLOYMENT TECHNICAL CHANGES. THE BILL A. B. EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE WILL REQUIRE CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY CCR RACE TO PATCH VULNERABLE COMPUTER SYSTEMS OR BE SUBJECT SUBJECT TO CIVIL OUR PENALTIES AWARDED TO INDIVIDUALS WHO STATE I WAS COMPROMISED. I'M THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN EQUIFAX DATA BREACH RESULTED IN THE LOSS OF ABOUT HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN POINT NINE MILLION U. S. CONSUMERS UP PERSONAL INFORMATION. PRIOR TO THE BREACH THE UNITED STATES A DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY NOTIFY EQUIFAX AND OTHER COMPANIES ON MARCH TO EIGHT TWENTY SEVENTEEN OF THE NEED TO PATCH SECURITY VULNERABILITIES IN SOFTWARE. CALL APACHE STROKES. ARE A PERFECT SEND A NOTIFICATION TO INTERNAL STAFF REQUESTING A FIXED TWO D. OUT OF HONOR ABILITY. HOWEVER DOT PATCH NEVER OCCUR. ALL CONSEQUENTLY BETWEEN ME THIRTEEN AND JULY THIRTY TWENTY SEVENTEEN HACKERS ARE EXPLOITED ALTHOUGH VULNERABILITY TO ACCESS SENSITIVE. PERSONAL INFORMATION INCLUDING CONSUMER NAMES ALSO SECURITY NUMBERS UP BIRTHDATES ADDRESSES AND IN SOME INSTANCES THE DRIVER'S LICENSE. AND ALSO CREDIT CARD NUMBERS THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE A C. C. R. A. CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. TO BEGIN TO IMPLEMENT. THE DO THE Q. WHAT IS EMPLOYMENT ARM TO BEGIN EMPLOYMENT A PATCH OF ITS COMPUTER SYSTEM WITHIN THREE DAYS. AND THEN COMPLETE THE INSTALLATION WITHIN THE MOST EXPEDIENT TIME POSSIBLE WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE INDUSTRY PRACTICE BEST PRACTICES BUT NO LONGER THAN THIRTY DAYS IN ANY OUR CASE. IF IT IS SO SUBJECT TO A VULNERABILITY DOT COULD COMPROMISE THE SECURITY OF OUR COMPUTERIZED DATA CONTAINING PERSONAL INFORMATION. ALL IF A CCR A FAILED TO PATCH TO SYSTEM AND A DATA BREACH OCCURS THE BILL WOULD ALLOW A RESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA. OF WHOSE INFORMATION WAS COMPROMISED TO BRING A CIVIL ACTION TO RECOVER DAMAGES FOR HIS OR HER DAMAGES TO. POSSIBLE BET PENALTIES AND. RECENTLY A REASONABLE ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS SO WE GOT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IDOL. FIRST WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON DANIEL KAUNDA KAISER ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARINGHOUSE. PEARCY IS A SIGN SAN DIEGO BASED NONPROFIT CONSUMER EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION WHOSE MISSION IS TO ENGAGE EDUCATE AND EMPOWER CONSUMERS. TO PROTECT THEIR PRIVACY. WE APPLAUD ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHARLES AUTHORSHIP OFAB EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE AND AGREE THAT ANY CRA CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA MOST EXPEDITIOUSLY. WORK TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AND WE ARE VERY PLEASED WITH THE AMENDMENTS I'M CHANGE FROM THE TEN DAYS TO THREE DAYS. AGAIN AS THE AUTHOR SAID AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHILD SAID WITH THE EQUIFAX AND BREACH WE WE THINK THAT THIS IS A TIMELY BILL ME OR DRIVE VOTE THANK YOU. NEXT ONE US. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MISTER VICE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RAINY PARK AND WE HAVE THE CONSUMER DATA INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. I FIRST WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT AND THE CHAIR STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US TO TRY TO RESOLVE SOME OF OUR CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL. WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF ADDRESSING POTENTIAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES IN THE SYSTEM. WE BELIEVE THAT EACH SECURITY VULNERABILITY HAS TO BE ASSESSED INDIVIDUALLY TO DETERMINE ITS RISK. INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES SUGGEST THAT YOU IMPLEMENT BASED ON RISK. THIS LANGUAGE SUGGESTED YOU TREAT EVERY SECURITY VULNERABILITY AS EQUAL AND MUST BE INSTALLED WITHIN THIRTY DAYS. REQUIRE PATCH TO BE INSTALLED WITH A THIRTY DAY LIMIT MAY NOT BE THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE. FOR EXAMPLE WHAT IF WE FIND OUT THAT A PATCHES THE STABILITY PROBLEMS IN A NEW PATCH IS NOT READY AT THE TIME ARE WE STILL OBLIGATED TO INSTALL THAT PATCH WITHIN THIRTY DAYS. SPECIFICALLY TO DEMAND ON PAGE FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS IT STATES THAT THE COMPANY SHALL BEGIN TO IMPLEMENT THE PATCH. BUT WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT PHRASE BUT WE PREVENT PLAN EMPLOYMENT HAS TO BE FURTHER DEFINED WE BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE DEFINED AS IT MEANS TO ASSESS. PLAN AND TEST AS THAT IS A PROCESS THAT TAKES PLACE BEFORE PATCH CAN BE INSTALLED. FINALLY WE OPPOSE A PRIVATE ACTION PART OF THE BILL AS WE BELIEVE THIS WOULD LEAD TO FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS. WITH THAT WE CONTINUE TO TRY TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND HOPE WE'LL HAVE SOME SUCCESS THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SUSAN LAUGHED AT TOUGH FOR THE CIVIL JUSTICE CESSATION IN OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. BAKER THANK YOU I'M TO AND TO THE FIRST ONE IS. THE. THE REQUIREMENTS. THAT THIS BE WITHIN A CERTAIN TIME PERIOD AND IT'S A SOFTWARE UPDATE. IS A LITTLE BIT STANDS OUT FOR ME BECAUSE SOMETIMES IN THE AREA BILL LAW WHETHER IT'S NOT ENTIRELY PRECISE WHAT WOULD BE THE MOST REASONABLE THING TO DO. IS INSTEAD OF A STANDARD BEING THAT YOU HAVE TO. DO YOU ACCESS AND IT NEEDS TO BE PRECISELY THIS PRESCRIPTIVE MEASURE IS YOU NEED TO DO WHATEVER IS THE STANDARD. THE MOST REASONABLE IT'S A REASONABLE PERSON STANDARD SIR MOST REASONABLE DECISION YOU HAVE OR SOMETHING IS INDUSTRY STANDARD Y. HAVE SOMETHING TO SPECIFIC IS IT HAS TO BE A SOFTWARE UPDATE AS OPPOSED TO. THE MOST REASONABLE STANDARD AND THE MOST REASONABLE RESPONSE WITHIN THE INDUSTRY THE BEST PRACTICES. CAN YOU ANSWER THAT ONE FIRST. SURE THE THE REASON WHY WE INSERTED A DAY IN THE IN THE LANGUAGES. ARE BASICALLY TO. ARE REQUIRED THE CCR IS TO BEGIN THE PROCESS FIRST OF ALL WITH RESPECT TO THE THREE DAY. SO WE WANT TO FOCUS ALL FOCUS ON THE VULNERABILITIES THAT WOULD. CAUSE ANY SECURITY ISSUES NUMBER ONE. AND I WE THINK THAT INSERTING A THREE THEY ARE START TIME IS GOING TO AT LEAST YOU KNOW OUR REQUIRED THESE. TCR RACE WHICH DEAL WITH VERY IMPORTANT. CONSUMER INFORMATION TO START THE BALL ROLLING. OUGHT NOW ARE YOU KNOW AS WE HEARD IN FACT. MANY OF THE AT THE CONGRESSIONAL HEARING REGARDING EQUIFAX THERE WAS TESTIMONY THAT THEY COULD DO IT IN TWO DAYS. ARE SO THIS IS YOU KNOW THAT THE TH TENDER THREE DAY AND THREE DAY PERIOD. WAS A RESULT OF A DIFFERENT YEAH YOU KNOW DIFFERENT TESTIMONIES AND AND AND RESEARCH AND BEST PRACTICE. SO SO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION DIRECTLY YOU KNOW IF WE JUST LEFT IT UP LEFT NO THEY IN THERE THEN THERE'S NO INCENTIVE TO DO THAT. I MEAN IT'S IT'S MY. POOR ASKING THE QUESTION I ASK MYSELF SO I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT ONE I READ. WE TRY AND THAT IS AND LESS CONCERNED ABOUT THE DATE. IT'S MORE THAT IT IS SPECIFICALLY A SOFTWARE UPDATE THAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THE PRESCRIPTION FOR DEALING WITH IT WHENEVER. I'M OUT OF TIME AS OPPOSED TO. A RESPONSE THAT IS EITHER INDUSTRY STANDARD OR BEST PRACTICES OR WHAT WOULD BE A REASONABLE PERSON'S DETERMINATION WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO RESPOND IT GIVES THE INDUSTRY OR WHATEVER ISSUES MAY BE. THE FLEXIBILITY TO DO WHAT IS PASSED AND IT MAY NOT BE A SOFTWARE UPDATED AB THAT'S ONE OF THE POINTS HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION IT IT MAY BE ANOTHER MATTER. THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE SO DETAILED AND. I THAT'S WHAT I'M WONDERING WHY YOU DIDN'T USE THAT STANDARD THAT'S FAIRLY PREVALENT IN THE LAW. AND IS ONE THAT ALLOWS THE FLEXIBILITY THAT IS FLUID AND ISN'T SO RIGID IS TO HAVE SOFTWARE UPDATE MUST BE DONE THIS WAY. BOB YEAH IN FACT THE BEST PRACTICE LANGUAGE IS PART OF THE LANGUAGE AS WELL. UP SO YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT IGNORING WHAT THE INDUSTRY DOES. SO SIMPLY SAYING THAT HE LOOK. DO THIS THING WITHIN THE. THE PURVIEW OF THE BEST PRACTICE OF THE INDUSTRY BUT START THE PROCESS SO YOU KNOW WITHIN THREE DAYS OF OF A NOTIFICATION GIVE IT IS THE THING THAT THEY'RE BEING TOLD TO DO IS TO. USE A SOFTWARE UPDATE. WE ARE SORRY WHEN I'M THAT'S IS SO IS THE THING THAT THEY'RE BEING ASKED TO DO THOSE TO BE A SOFTWARE UPDATE AS OPPOSED TO. A OKAY. CORRECT AM RIGHT AND AND WE ALSO ARE UNDER THE AMENDMENTS WERE ALSO ASKING THE TO COMPANY TO. ARE START THE. MITIGATION ARE A PROCESS ALSO TO YOU WE DON'T WANT IT WE DON'T WANT TO CREATE A PATCH THAT WOULD. EXACERBATE THE SITUATION FIRST OF ALL OUGHT TO THE IDEA IS TO START THE BALL ROLLING BUT YET AT THE SAME TIME IMPLEMENT SOME KIND OF MITIGATION MEASURES TO REDUCE YOU KNOW THE POTENTIAL. OF HAVING A YOU KNOW. THE PAKSHA CREATING PROBLEMS OR OR JUST STOP YOU KNOW BASICALLY STOP THE BLEEDING. OKAY A POINT ON THANK YOU TYPOLOGIES SO I'M AND RELATED TO THAT GOES TO THE OTHER POINT THE OPPOSITION'S RAISED IS THAT THERE MAY BE IF WE ARE SO SPECIFIC AS TO SAY IT NEEDS TO BE A SOFTWARE UPDATE. OR A SOFTWARE PATCH. AND THAT. DOES NOT PROVIDE. THE FLEXIBILITY TO EITHER ADDRESS THE PROBLEM MAY DESTABILIZE THE SYSTEM. I'VE CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT POINT AS WELL BECAUSE I MY UNDERLINGS IN YEARS I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WHAT HAPPENED THAT WHAT INSPIRED YOUR BILL IS COMPLETELY INTOLERABLE AND THERE SHOULD BE A VERY DIFFERENT RESPONSE AND JUST. THAT IT'S ALMOST A NEGLIGENCE STANDARD THAT WE SHOULD USE HERE BECAUSE I JUST SCREAMED OF NEGLIGENCE. BUT WE DON'T USUALLY JUDGE WHAT SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED. BY DID YOU DO ONE SPECIFIC PRESCRIPTIVE RESPONSE AS OPPOSED TO WHAT WAS PASSED IN THE OPPOSITION HAS RAISED A POINT THAT A SOFTWARE UPDATE MAY NOT BE THE BEST OPTION. HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THAT POINT? WELL A SOFTWARE UPDATE MAY NOT BE THE BEST SOLUTION BUT YET I THINK WHAT WE'RE ASKING IN THE BILL IS TO FOR THE COMPANY TO START. IMPLEMENTING START THE PROCESS. WHICH DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN APPLYING THAT PATCH SO FOR THAT PARTICULAR SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE SO YOU KNOW WE DO PROVIDE YOU KNOW A A A A A A TIME PERIOD WHERE THEY HAVE TO EVALUATE WHAT'S BEST FOR THE COMPANY. A WEATHER NOT A ONE APPLY TO GET UP TO PATCH ME THE THE THE THE BILL ITSELF ALSO DOZEN REALLY. PENALIZE THE COMPANY IF THERE'S NO PREACH. SO. IF IF IT'S IF THE COMPANY DEEMS IT ARE PROPER TO NOT APPLY THE PATCH IN THEIR SITUATION IT'S THEIR PREROGATIVE ALSO BUT IT SO LONG AS IT DOESN'T CAUSE ANY BREACH. AND FUTURE. THINKING THERE IF THERE'S NO CONNECTION THERE'S A NEXT NO NEXUS BETWEEN APPLYING A PATCH TO THE ULTIMATE BREACH THEN THERE'S NO LIABILITY. THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISTER OBERNOLTE. SEVERAL THAT I UNDERSTOOD WHAT SHOULD I DO AND I AM SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL IN GENERAL JUST HAD IT A COUPLE OF YOUR SUGGESTIONS THAT I HOPE ARE HELPFUL. SARAH AND. A SIMILAR TO WHAT I'VE SAID BEFORE. I'M. I THINK WE NEED TO AVOID AMBIGUITY. ESPECIALLY WHEN THE CONSEQUENCES THROUGH PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION ARE SO SERIOUS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO VIOLATED THIS. PROPOSED LAW SO. I THINK WHEN WE SAY SECURITY VULNERABILITY WE NEED WHEN YOU MIGHT NEEDS TO DEFINE EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEAN. BY VULNERABILITY BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY A SUPERFICIAL VULNERABILITY IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO TARGET AND ALSO WHEN. WHEN YOU SAY A BREACH OF SECURITY I THINK YOU NEED TO DEFINE EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS BECAUSE A SUPERFICIAL BREACH OF SECURITY I DON'T THINK YOU'D WANT TO TRIGGER THIS. I AND I ALSO THINK THAT THAT YOU MIGHT ITS DEFINITION ON EXACTLY WHAT WHAT YOU MEAN WHEN YOU SAY AN INJURY HAS OCCURRED. THAT TRIGGERS THIS PRIDE RIGHT AFFECT RIGHT OF ACTION BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY. SUPERFICIAL INJURY IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE'RE TARGETING BUT OTHER THOSE ARE JUST SUGGESTIONS ON HAVING A SPORT THAT THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AND WE DO INTEND THAT KIND OF FINE TUNE THE BILL AS WE GO ALONG AND IF INCLUDING THE DATE AND AND. AND. YOU KNOW THE TIME PERIOD SO. YOU KNOW WE'RE KIND OPEN TO WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO SEE WHAT'S PASS. FOR THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE AS AS WELL AS WHAT HE FOR THE CONSUMER SO WE DON'T WANT TO. WE DON'T WANT TO JAM SOMETHING DOWN. YOU KNOW THEY'RE CUT THE THROAT IF IT DOESN'T WORK OF IT YOU KNOW EXACERBATING SITUATION. SO I GLOBAL POINT WELL TAKEN. I DON'T HOUSE. SHALL WE GET CLOSE I A RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR ARRIVAL AND. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL AND I I THINK. ICE I WANNA CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO TO FIND OUT YOU KNOW TO FIND THAT SWEET SPOT. SO WITH THAT I I'D AS WE HAVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAO ON. SO I I APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE ONE OF THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE OR DEEPLY SHAKEN. BY THE BREACH THE REFERRED TO BUT I THINK MS BAKER HAD THE NAIL ON THE HEAD THAT I JUST DON'T THINK A PER SE RULE. AYE THAT AUTOMATICALLY TRIGGERS DAMAGES MAKES SENSE IN THIS CONTEXT. AND THAT. IT DOESN'T GET THE INCENTIVES RIGHT AYE TO MAXIMIZE SECURITY IN THAT WE MUCH BE MUCH BETTER SERVED. BY LIABILITY HINGING ON ON THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE COMPANY. IF IF HARM IS SUFFERED SO I HAVE NO REASON FOR HIM NOT GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT LOOK FOR SEEING HOW IT EVOLVES. MADAM SECRETARY THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO. APPROPRIATIONS I BELIEVE AT NEW PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. IT WAS A LITTLE. TO PASS A THAT'S MY MISTAKE WE DO NEED A MOTION AND A SECOND. ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE TO PASS AS AMENDED TO JUDICIARY. TELL AYE AYE KILEY NOW NOW BAKER. I BERMAN. CALDERON. AYE IRWIN. AYE MULLIN. AYE OBERNOLTE. AYE REYES. AYE. TEN. I. SO ITS EIGHT THE BILL THAT. LIKE YOU IMAGE OKAY I SAW MISTER COOPER HAD ARRIVED NAM TERRIBLE SICK HE'S GONE UP SO LET'S PROCEED TO MISTER I CHAO'S NEXT BILL WHICH I BELIEVE WOULD BE. A. B. TWENTY ONE SIXTY SEVEN. I'M FOR. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. LET ME ALSO SIDE BY ACCEPTING THE AUTHORS AMEND AND. IN THE AISLE IN THE. ANALYSIS. IN RESPONSE TO CONCERNS RAISED BY THE CHAIR OF THE HEALTH COMMITTEE DEMANDS. TIGHTEN UP THE DEFINITION OF DIGITAL HEALTH CARE. OF FEEDBACK SYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT WE. WON'T NEED TO AMEND THE STATUTE OF A TIME IN NEW TECHNOLOGY IS INTRODUCED. THANK YOU SECONDLY SOME ARE MANUFACTURERS OF ADJUSTABLE SENSORS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER THE REQUIREMENT THAT MANUFACTURERS OF A DIGITAL A FEEDBACK SYSTEM EQUIPPED TO SYSTEM WITH REASONABLE SECURITY MEASURES. ALL THIS REQUIREMENT WAS WRITTEN TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF ANY SOFTWARE OR DEVICE THAT COLLECTS INFORMATION ACCORDINGLY THESE AMENDMENTS WOULD ALSO ACCEPT THE MANUFACTURERS OF THE IN JUST A BOTH ANSWER. FROM THE OBLIGATION TO EQUIP THE EQUIPMENT WAIT THE REASONABLE SECURITY OF FEATURES. OF THE BILL ITSELF WOULD IMPLEMENT REASONABLE REGULATIONS FOR THE USE OF DIGITAL HEALTH CARE FEEDBACK SYSTEM INCLUDING ITEMS ALSO KNOWN AS DIGITAL PILLS. WHILE TECHNOLOGY STANDS TO IMPROVE HOW HEALTHCARE IS DELIVERED A THESE ADVANCEMENTS DO NOT COME WITHOUT RISK HEALTH AND MEDICAL INFORMATION IS BY ITS VERY NATURE DEEPLY PERSONAL AND SENSITIVE. NEW TECHNOLOGY MAKES MEDICAL INFORMATION EASILY AND QUICKLY ACCESSIBLE VIA APPS IN OF WEBSITES AND CALIFORNIA HOUSE AND SURE THAT MEDICAL INFORMATION HELD BY MOBILE DEVICES IS PROTECTED UNDER ALL PRIVACY LAWS. HOWEVER IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED MEDICAL INFORMATION ALL THE INFORMATION GENERALLY NEEDS TO BE GENERATED. BY A HEALTHCARE PROVIDER INFORMATION THAT IS GENERATED BY DIGITAL HEALTH FEEDBACK SYSTEM MEANING AT THE PATIENT LEVEL AND OUTSIDE OF A MEDICAL FACILITY WILL NOT NECESSARILY BE CAPTURE. UNDER THE EXISTING DEFINITION OF MEDICAL. INFORMATION. SEVERAL FORMS OF DIGITAL PILLOWS THAT SEND INFORMATION FROM PLACES LIKE THE DIGESTIVE TRACT WILL BLOODSTREAM ARE BEING DEVELOPED. WITH A FEW ALREADY IN USE. NOW THESE DIGITAL PILLS WEAKENED WHICH COMBINE OUR ADJUSTABLE MICROCHIP SENSORS WITHOUT WITHOUT PHARMACEUTICALS CAN OPERATE IN A MANNER IN A NUMBER OF WAYS. THEY CAN CONTROL AND MONITOR THE RELEASE OF ACTIVE FOR PHARMACEUTICAL. OUR INGREDIENTS AFTER INGESTION THE CAN ALSO RECORD. WHETHER WHEN WHERE AND IN WHAT QUANTITIES A DRUG IS RELEASED AS WELL AS INFORMATION ABOUT THE PHYSICAL STATE OF THE PERSON TAKING THAT TRIP. SUCH AS TEMPERATURE ACTIVITY LEVEL HEART RATE AND RESPIRATION. NO THE INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER A PATIENT TOOK HIS OR HER MEDICATION AND HOW THAT MEDICATION INTERACTED IN THEIR BODIES. IS UNQUESTIONABLE OF A MEDICAL NATURE. SO IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE INFORMATION GENERATED BY THE DIGITAL SYSTEM IS CLASSIFIED AS MEDICAL INFORMATION AND DEVELOPERS AND DEVELOPERS AND OPERATORS OF HARDWARE SOFTWARE AND APPLICATIONS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH. THE GERBILS ARE ALREADY PROHIBITED FROM SHARING THE INFORMATION WITHOUT THE PATIENT'S INFORMED CONSENT. ARE THE BILL WOULD BE FINE DIGITAL HEALTH FEEDBACK SYSTEM TO INCLUDE INFORMATION SUCH AS DIGITAL BELT. AND ENSURE THAT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF MEDICAL INFORMATION ACT WAS CMI A. APPLIES TO INFORMATION DERIVED FROM OR IN THE POSSESSION OF THE SYSTEMS THE BILL WOULD ALSO FOR THE REQUIRED A MANUFACTURER IS EQUIPPED DIGITAL HEALTH. FEEDBACK SYSTEMS WITH REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE SECURITY MEASURES ARM. SO A BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION I AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR ARRIVAL. OTHER NEW ISN'T SMART. OPPOSITION. WHAT'S YOUR TECHNICAL TERM MISTER CHAIR FOR THOSE WHO ARE NEITHER. WIENERS. OKAY. DIGITAL BILLS. FOR THOSE WHO ARE NEITHER SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION I GOT HERE THAT. WHAT'S THAT DISAPPEAR OR ARE YOU GONNA BE TESTED BY LENGTH WHATEVER SUITS YOU. ALL OF ROCK GRAY CALIFORNIA LIFE SCIENCES ASSOCIATION. CONCERNS. WE ONE THINK THE AUTHOR IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US. WE'VE EXPRESSED THESE CONCERNS TO THEM THIS TECHNOLOGIES IT'S AN IN ITS INFANCY OF THE SENSORS ARE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A GRAIN OF SAND THEY DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO TRANSMIT INDEPENDENTLY. THEY ARE USED IN A VERY NICHE MARKET FOR MEDICATION NON ADHERENCE SO IN THE CASE OF A OF A PATIENT WHO NEEDS TO TAKE MEDICINE. ON A VERY REGULATED SCHEDULE THAT DOES SO FOR VARIOUS REASONS I COULD BE MENTAL HEALTH COULD BE. A NUMBER OF REASONS. THIS TECHNOLOGY WOULD ALLOW A PHYSICIAN TO PROPERLY MONITOR OR CARETAKER TO PROPERLY MONITOR THAT THE PATIENT IS INGESTING THE MEDICATION THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO TAKE WHEN THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO TAKE IT. AYE AND TRACK THAT. IN TERMS OF COST OF THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM MEDICATION NON ADHERENTS. COSTS ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND LIVES A YEAR. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS SO AGAIN THIS TECHNOLOGY IS IS AT THE VERY BEGINNING STAGES OF WHERE IT COULD ONE DAY BE. OVER REGULATING AT THIS POINT MAY STIFLE INNOVATION AND WERE JUST CONCERNED THAT. WE BE SENSITIVE TO THOSE ISSUES THAT WHEN REPORTS UP THANK YOU AGAIN. HI GOOD AFTERNOON AT MY NAME'S FIELDING GRIEVE SOME WITH THE ADVANCEMENT OF TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ONE ASSOCIATE WITH MY COMMENTS I WITH HIM HIS COMMENTS. AND ALSO TO SHARE THAT WE THINK IT COULD BE PREMATURE AT THIS TIME TO REGULATE THIS TECHNOLOGY IN THIS WAY. GIVEN THE OVERLAPPING THAT FEDERAL REGULATIONS FTA AND I HAVE TO SEE CURRENTLY HAVE. FDA REGULATIONS DO AB CONSIDER A HOLISTIC RISK BASED APPROACH TO MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY SO THAT INCLUDES ALL DATA STEWARDSHIP ISSUES BOTH CYBERSECURITY. AND DATA PRIVACY. AT THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION IS EXTREMELY BROAD AUTHORITY UNDER SECTION FIVE TO REGULATE. ON DECEPTIVE I OR UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES SO. CURRENTLY THE THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S IN THE INDUSTRY IT'S HELD OUT TO THE CONSUMER AND INTO THE MARKETPLACE. AS GIVING FULL CONTROL AND OWNERSHIP OF THE DATA TO THE ACTUAL PATIENT INCLUDING WHETHER OR NOT THAT DATE IS GIVEN OVER TO THE DOCTOR. HIM HERSELF. SO IF THAT WERE EVER FOUND OUT TO BE TRUE THEY BEEN VIOLATION OF THE ACT THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION COULD CERTAINLY STEP AND THEY HAVE EXTREMELY BROAD AUTHORITY TO DO TO DO SO. AND THEY ALSO CURRENTLY HAVE AN MO YOU WITH THE FDA TO TO. COLLABORATE WITH THE FDA ON THAT PLATFORM REGULATIONS SO WITH THAT WE JUST EXPRESSES CONCERNS. ANY OTHER WITNESSES OF ANY KIND. ALL RIGHT BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE NOW. MR CHOW DO YOU WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT JUST TO. ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS BECAUSE IT DOES SEEM LIKE WE HAVE. QUITE A LOT OF THAT REGULATORS OUT THERE THERE'S THE FDA APPROVAL PROCESS FOR EXAMPLE SO WHAT IS THIS GONNA AT. I THINK I THINK JUST OF THIS BILL IS TO BASICALLY ARM. MAKE SURE THE THE INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT ARE BY THESE DIGITAL PILLS IS PROTECTED THAT'S THE ULTIMATE UNDERLYING A RATIONALE FOR THE BILL. NOW CURRENTLY UNDER YOU THEIR HIP OR CMI A TO CALIFORNIA VERSION OF IT BUT. ESSENTIALLY PROTECTS INFORMATION THAT'S GENERATED BY LET'S SAY HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. AND DOW IF IT IF IT IS STAND IT'S A PROTECTIVE BUT ARE NOW ALSO IF THE INFORMATION IS RECEIVED BY THE MEDICAL PROVIDER ALL BEEN IT'S ALSO PROTECTED YET UNDER DISSERVICE CONSENSUS. OP THE JET THE INFORMATION IS GENERATED APPLIED TO DEVISE A WHICH BEFORE IT GETS UP RECEIVED BY THE YOU KNOW THAT THE. POSITION FOR EXAMPLE IT'S NOT IT'S NOT PROTECTED SO WHICH IS TRYING TO CLOSE OUT LOW GAP THERE SO. YOU KNOW IF THEM YOU KNOW IT OF IT IF DOT INFORMATION IS ALREADY GENERATED BY A PHYSICIAN WAS ALWAYS PROTECTED IF IT'S RECEIVED BY VISITING IT'S A PROTECTED BUT IT'S NOT LITTLE KIND OF A GAP IN BETWEEN. THAT WE TRYING TO THE PLUG SO THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT TO TO THESE DEVICES THAT WOULD GENERATE ARE YOU KNOW. HEALTH CARE INFORMATION PLEASE FOR DOUBLE HEART RATE OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE. ON THEN BEFORE IT REACHES THAT THE. THE POSITIONS OF OFFICE THEN DOT WILL YOU KNOW THERE'S LITTLE DOUBT THAT YOU KNOW THAT. WE TRY TO PROTECT. TWO SO THAT'S THE ESSENCE OF THE BILL SO IT'S A VERY TINY LITTLE THING ARE SO THE IN FACT. WE ALREADY HOUSE A BILL THAT I IN FACT. AUTHORED BY A MISTER CALDERON LAST YEAR THAT WOULD PROTECT THAT WOULD GIVE THE SAME IT'S THE SAME PROTECTION TO. THE DEVICES THAT WOULD GENERATE I MEAN ARE YOU THIS IS SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE. FOLKS ARE YOU KNOW. IT'S A DIFFERENT BILL A BILL NUMBER FIVE YET EXACTLY WOULDN'T BILL NUMBER THAT WAS BROUGH YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THAT LITTLE GAP THERE. SO I HOPE THAT CLARIFIES. ALSO THAT THAT'S A FEDERAL LINE AND STATE LAW. WE DON'T STUFF I DON'T WANT TO STIFLE IN WE INNOVATION YOU KNOW FOR SURE. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MISTER OBERNOLTE. SO WITHOUT SEEMING LIKE A BOOK BROKEN RECORD I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE SPECIFIC. ESPECIALLY ONE THE CONSEQUENCES OF VIOLATION OF THE LAW ARE SEVERE AS THEY ARE HERE BECAUSE IT CREATES NEW CRIMINAL LIABILITY. SO I THERE'S A TERM IN THERE THAT SAYS THAT. WHAT'S REQUIRED A REASONABLE SECURITY FEATURES APPROPRIATE TO THE NATURE OF THE SYSTEM. AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB DEFINING EXACTLY WHAT REASONABLE SECURITY FEATURES ARE BECAUSE I JUST CAN ENVISION A ROOM FULL OF LAWYERS ARGUING ABOUT. WITH EACH OTHER ABOUT WHAT WE MET WHEN WE SET REASONABLE SO I HAD TO TO SUGGESTION NOT GOT A QUESTION FOR YOU IS. I NOTICED THAT YOU ALSO SAID REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT. THE IDENTIFICATION SITE THE. DATA IS I DIDN'T AS INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE AND I'M WONDERING WHY. YOU PUT THAT IN THERE BECAUSE IT WOULD SEEM LIKE ONLY THE INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IS THE ONE THAT WE WOULD HAVE FOR PRIVACY CONCERNS ABOUT. PA I HAVE LOOKED AT THE LANGUAGE A BIT MORE CLOSELY BUT I I THINK THE INTENT IS TO PROTECT. OUR INFORMATION THAT WOULD ALLOW ANYBODY TO OUR LINK BACK TO THE THE. THE. GENERATOR OF THAT OF THAT PERSON. BEAT OUT A PRINT PATIENT OR THE HUESO TO ANY INFORMATION THAT WOULD ALLOW SOMEBODY TO IDENTIFY. TO YOU KNOW. THAT PERSON I THINK WE WANT PROTECT. I WOULD AGREE DOWN BUT I WOULDN'T CLASSIFY ANYTHING WHICH YOU COULD LINK BACK AS INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE AND I DON'T THINK THAT DATA. THAT'S AGGREGATED FOR EXAMPLE WHAT PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS TOOK THEIR PILLS.

THESE RESOURCES TO THERE OUGHT TO THEIR UTMOST ADVANTAGES IN AND CRITICAL AREAS INCLUDING ELECTIONS.

WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT. HOPEFULLY THIS WILL GO QUICK. I THANK YOU AGAIN MR AND A MEMBERS. AB THIRTY ONE NINETY THREE IS A FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD BILL A JOINTLY AUTHORED BY MYSELF AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS IRWIN AND OBERNOLTE TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE WE HEARD ABOUT MOST. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH MOST RECENTLY IN A JOINT OVERSIGHT HEARING ON CYBERSECURITY ALL IN FEBRUARY STATED IN THE SIMPLEST FORM WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT OUR. OF COURSE CYBERSECURITY PARTNERS NAMELY CDT. OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT ALSO CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL ARE S. EFFECTIVE AS POSSIBLE IN SECURING OUR STATE ALL TO THAT AND THIS BILL SEEKS TO ENSURE THAT THE OFFICE OF INFORMATION SECURITY OR WHY S.. HOUSE AS COMPLETE A PICTURE AS POSSIBLE WITH RESPECT TO INFORMATION SECURITY IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. ARE CURRENTLY UNDER EXISTING LAW THERE'S A CLEAR DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE MAY BELIEVE WE HAVE GIVEN TO ALL AYE US AND THE ABILITY OF ALL AYE AS TO ACTUALLY CARRY OUT THOSE DUTIES. TECHNICALLY SPEAKING OF THIS CONFUSION ARISES AS A RESULT OF HOW OR WHY S. ENABLING STATUTE HAS BEEN DRAFTED. A SPECIFICALLY THE LEGISLATURE HAS CHARGED A WHY S. WITH DUTIES OVER STATE AGENCIES QUOTE UNQUOTE IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH IN ONE PART OF THAT STATUTE. BUT IN THE VERY NEXT PART OF THAT SAME STATUE ONLY CERTAIN A STATE ENTITIES WHO ARE WOULD DIRECT REPORTING TO GET THE GOVERNOR ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY. WITH A WHY S. ISSUE STANDARD POLICIES PROCEDURES INCIDENT NOTIFICATIONS FILING REQUIREMENTS AND REPORT. SO ACCORDINGLY THIS BILL REMOVES ANY AMBIGUITY ALL IN THE LAW AND CLEARLY STATES THAT ALL STATE AGENCIES MUST COMPLY WITH A WHY S. ISSUE INFORMATION SECURITY REQUIREMENTS. ALTHOUGH I THINK I WANT WANT TO SAY IS THAT WHILE THIS BILL HAS NO FORMAL OF FORMAL OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME I DO KNOW THAT SOME OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS. ARE INCLUDING THE. THE AG'S OFFICE AND ALSO THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE HAVE REACHED OUT TO AS A TO DISCUSS CONCERNS THAT ABOUT HOW THIS BILL MIGHT IMPACT THEIR OFFICES IN PARTICULAR. I DO. STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO REMOVE ANY UNNECESSARY AND. AMBIGUITY IN STATUTE. TO BRING AS I'M MUCH OF CONSISTENCY AS POSSIBLE CROSS WAS THE GOVERNMENT CYBER SECURITY AND INFORMATION SECURITY. I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK CONTINUE WORKING WITH THESE OFFICES TO SEE HOW WE COULD DO. ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES ARE IF THAT'S POSSIBLE SO ULTIMATELY I'M WE WANT TO MAKE CYBERSECURITY AS STRONG AS POSSIBLE. ARE NOW IN THE STATE AND IN A WAY THAT REALLY ARE MAKE SENSE SO GREAT OVER. WE RESPECT US SO WE GOT I LIKE TO ASK FOR YOU I DON'T THINK YOU. THINGS CHAO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE ON BEHALF JOHN CHIANG. AND THE DEPUTY TREASURER OF TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION IN THE CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER AT THE OFFICE. THE TREASURER'S OFFICE HAS CONCERNS RELATED TO THE BILL IS YOU CAN READ SEE REFLECTED IN OUR LETTER. IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS TO ENSURE OUR STATE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES ARE COMPLIANT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS THE INFORMATION SECURITY AND PRIVACY POLICIES STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES AS ISSUED BY THE OFFICE OF THE STATE INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER. AND THE FILING AN INCIDENT NOTIFICATIONS REQUIREMENTS ISSUED BY THE STATE INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT OUR OFFICES ALREADY COMPLIANCE WITH THESE PROCEEDINGS AND DUTIES. OUR CONCERN WITH THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT IS THAT IT WILL EXPAND THE SCOPE OF THE GOVERNOR'S AUTHORITY. TO GIVE MANDATING POWER TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY OVER CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICES REGARDING THEIR INFORMATION SECURITY OPERATIONS. OUR YOU SHE WAS NOT WITH COMPLYING A STATED EARLIER WE ALREADY DO SO. THE INDEPENDENCE OF CALIFORNIA'S CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICES IS PART OF THE STATE'S SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES. WHICH AS DESIGN MITIGATES THE RISK THAT AN ENTITY EXTERNAL TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE CONSTITUTIONALLY ELECTED OFFICE HOLDER. CAN UNDULY A ROAD THAT INDEPENDENCE AND PLACE BURDENS OF RESPONSIBILITY FINANCIAL OR OTHERWISE WHICH DO NOT ALIGN WITH THE PRIORITIES OF THE ELECTED OFFICIAL. ALTHOUGH UNIFORMITY IN STANDARDS SECURITY IS HIGHLY IMPORTANT WE DO NOT BELIEVE EXPANDING THE GOVERNOR'S AUTHORITY OVER CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICES IS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. KATHLEEN SHARON MEMBERS I AM AMY ALLEY WITH A CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. AND FIRST I WANTED TO THINK I'M ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAO FOR YOUR GRACIOUS COMMENTS ABOUT WORKING WITH FAST THEY REALLY APPRECIATED WORKING WITH BOTH YOUR STAFF AND YOUR ON COMMITTEE STAFF THIS WEEK.

OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON SUE BANG ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TOM TOILETS AND. RESPECTFULLY HERE WITH SERIOUS THAT TRONG CONCERNS IN OPPOSITION OF TO THE SPELL. AT THE SUPERINTENDENT JUST TOOK THIS POSITION SO WE APOLOGIZE FOR NOT SENDING A LETTER IN ADVANCE. BOB SUPERINTENDENT SUPPORTS EFFORTS TO WORK WITH OTHER AGENCIES AND TO IMPROVE CYBERSECURITY IN FACT PART OF EDUCATION AND ALSO COMPLIES WITH. A THE PROVISIONS STATS IN THE SPELL HOWEVER HE DOES NOT SUPPORT A REVISION OF GOVERNMENT COACH TO GIVE. OF THAT CALIFORNIA PART OF TECHNOLOGY AUTHORITY OVER CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICES AS AND THE OTHER MEMBERS HAVE SUGGESTED. THEIR FORUM WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE ABOUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TED MAUL HOUSE OR ON BEHALF OF SECRETARY OF STATE AL EXPEDIA WE ARE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE DOES NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THIS BILL WE ARE STILL REVIEWING IT THANK YOU. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM CURRENT MEMBERS. THIS EARLY. I AM HAPPY TO BE. THE JOINT AUTHOR OF THIS BILL WITH YOU AND AND WITH MISTER OBERNOLTE AND I I JUST WANNA SAY THAT WHEN I AUTHORED. SIX SEVENTY. WE HAD ALL THE DEPARTMENT SAYING THAT. THESE THESE AUDITS OF THIS IS A SECURITY ASSESSMENTS WERE UNNECESSARY. AND THEN A FEW MONTHS LATER WE HAD. THAT AN OVERSIGHT HEARING AND IT TURNS OUT THAT. MANY OF THE DEPARTMENTS WERE I NOT COMPLIANT AND DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE VULNERABILITIES THAT THEY HAVE SO OF HERE A COUPLE YEARS LATER WE'VE SEEN INCREDIBLE STRIDES MADE. BY REQUIRING THESE SECURITY ASSESSMENT SO I I REALLY DO HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL. WORK TOGETHER AND MAKE SURE YOU KNOW OUR OUR INTENTION IS TO MAKE SURE THAT'S THAT. EVERYBODY THAT LIVES IN CALIFORNIA HAS THEIR INFORMATION PROTECTED IN ALL THESE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AND AND MAKING SURE THAT EACH OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS HAS A MINIMUM LEVEL OF. SECURITY I DON'T THINK IS UNREASONABLE SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN WORK TOGETHER AND COME UP WITH SOME SORT OF SOLUTION. MISTER CHOW WHICH OUTLAWS HERE ARE AT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT OF FOR THE RECORD I JUST WANTED TO STATE THAT. WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED A COPY OF THE LETTER FROM THREE YEARS OFFICE IN FACT TODAY'S THE FIRST TIME WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THAT THE CONTENT OF THE LETTER SO.

AND A STAKEHOLDERS SAID IN RESOLVING THIS A THIS AMBIGUITY ISSUE WHICH HAS BEEN FESTERING FOR A LONG TIME SO. SO YOU KNOW THE PROBLEM WITH WITH TI TEES AT ANYA WHICH STATURE WHAT IT WHAT PART OF THE STATUE OF THE. ALLIGATOR CHO TO COMPLY WITH I MEAN SO THERE'S A LOT OF AMBIGUITY WHICH CAUSES A LOT OF CONFUSION ON THEIR PART. SAID I I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY INTENT TO SAY YOU KNOW WE WANT CONTROL OVER YOU KNOW CERTAIN OFFICES I THINK THE INTENT IS TO BASICALLY LEVERAGE WHAT WE HOW. AT THE STATE LEVEL AS FAR AS THE CYBERSECURITY IS CONCERNED SO SO WE COULD YOU KNOW WHAT WE DON'T WANT IT YOU KNOW. DO DOUBLE DUTY I THINK IF WE CAN LEVERAGE AND AND YOU UTILIZED OF THESE RESOURCES TO THE PHONE AS I THINK THAT IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL THAT THOUGH WE HAVE SO WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR ABBOTT.
