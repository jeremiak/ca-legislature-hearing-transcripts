SURGERY NO TRUTH SUSAN B. ANTHONY AND ELIZABETH STANTON HOWEVER NOT ALL WOMEN WERE INCLUDED IN THIS VICTORY IN FACT VOTING RIGHTS FOR WOMEN OF COLOR DID NOT COME INTO THE MID TWENTIETH CENTURY NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN IN NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR CHINESE AMERICAN WOMEN NINETEEN FORTY THREE.

AND IT WAS NOT INTO THE PASSAGE OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE FORTY FIVE YEARS AFTER THE ENACTMENT OF THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT THAT BLACK WOMEN COULD EXERCISE THIS RIGHT WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS WOMEN'S EQUALITY DAY ALSO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT. EVEN NOW BARRIERS TO WOMEN'S PARTICIPATION AND EQUALITY IN ALL SPHERES OF LIFE. AND SOCIETY STILL EXIST ON MANY LEVELS FOR EXAMPLE. IN CALIFORNIA'S THRIVING STEM FIELD WOMEN ONLY MAKE UP 28% OF THAT WORKFORCE IN PARTICULAR ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES TWO OF THE MOST LUCRATIVE STEM FEELS REMAIN HEAVILY MALE DOMINATED ONLY 21% OF ENGINEERING MAJORS AND 19% OF COMPUTER SCIENCE MAJORS ARE WOMEN WOMEN ARE ALSO AND REPRESENTED IN LEADERSHIP ROLES IN MEDICINE WELL 30% OF FULL TIME POSITIONS ARE WOMEN AND ARE WOMEN THERE IS A GREATER DISPARITY AND DISCREPANCY AND WOMEN IN LEADERSHIP ROLES SUCH AS CHAIRS OF VARIOUS DIVISIONS AND DEANS OF MEDICAL SCHOOLS WHEN IT COMES TO EMPLOYMENT WOMEN WHO POSSESS THE SAME QUALIFICATIONS AS THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS EARN FAR LESS WHEN ENTERING INTO SIMILAR PROFESSIONS SPECIFICALLY WHITE WOMEN EARN SEVENTY NINE CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR A WHITE MALE EARNS AND IT IS MORE EGREGIOUS FOR WOMEN OF COLOR BLACK WOMEN WITH THE SAME QUALIFICATIONS EARNED SIXTY TWO CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR A WHITE MALE EARNS.

IN MEMBERS WE WILL NOW TAKE A FILE ITEM THIRTY SIX. SB NINE THIS IS FILE ITEM THIRTY SIX SB NINE. CORPORATION SENATE BILL NINE BUYS ATKINS AND OTHERS AN APPLICANT'S LAND USE MYSTERY THAT'S YOU MAY OPEN WELL THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS WHAT THEY GET READY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO. PRESENT US SENATE BILL NINE HERE THIS MORNING ON BEHALF OF SENATE- PROTON TONI ATKINS THIS IS A MOMENT THAT THAT SOME SO MANY OF US WHO ARE WORKING ON WAYS TO ADDRESS OUR STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS- HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR. WE'VE BEEN ON A MULTI YEAR QUEST FOR SOLUTIONS. AND THIS MORNING WE HAVE ONE OF THOSE SOLUTIONS RIGHT HERE FOR OUR- OF OUR VOTE IN A CONSIDERATION AND IT'S NOT A PERFECT BAYLOR A SOLUTION BUT IT IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THAT WILL BEGIN TO HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ARE CRIPPLING HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA SB NINE THE CALIFORNIA HOME ACT TO PROVIDE OPTIONS FOR HOMEOWNERS AND SINGLE FAMILY ZONES IT DOES THIS BY STREAMLINING THE PROCESS TO ALLOW FOR THE CREATION OF A DUPLEX. OR PROVIDING THEM THE OPTION TO SUBDIVIDE IN EXISTING LAW TO CREATE MORE HOUSING MODELED AFTER EXISTING EXISTING CALIFORNIA EIGHTY YOU LAW. WHICH ALLOWS FOR AT LEAST THREE UNITS PER LOT SENATE BILL NINE ALLOWS FOR UP TO FOUR UNITS PER LOT. AND FOR MANY OF YOU THIS THIS THIS THIS BILL WILL LOOK VERY SIMILAR TO A BILL THAT- MATTER PRO TEM AUTHORED LAST SESSION ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN TWENTY. WHICH PASSED OFF THIS FLOOR WITH SOME BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND AFTER LISTENING TO FEEDBACK FROM HOMEOWNERS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS LAST YEAR'S SENATE BILL ELEVEN TWENTY WAS SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED UPON TO BECOME THIS YEAR'S SENATE BILL NINE. THE FIRST SENATE BILL NINE ESTABLISHES A SPECIFIC LIST OF QUALIFICATIONS THAT MUST BE MET TO PROTECT EXISTING TENANTS HISTORIC DISTRICTS BY MIDDLE QUALITY IN COASTAL REQUIREMENTS SECOND THE BILL NOW IT BETTER PROTECTS NEIGHBORHOODS. ASIAN BY MAKING IT A STATE WIDE REQUIREMENT TO SURE THAT HOMEOWNERS WILL BENEFIT FROM THESE NEW HOUSING OPTIONS NOT CORPORATE INVESTORS THIRD SENATE BILL NINE NOW AUTHORIZES A LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO DENY A PROPOSED HOUSING DEVELOPMENT OR A LOT SPLIT IF A BUILDING OFFICIAL MAKES A FINDING THAT THERE IS AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON PUBLIC HEALTH PUBLIC SAFETY WHAT'S THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT IF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN DOCUMENT THIS ADVERSE IMPACT FOR PROPOSED PROJECTS PERHAPS EIGHT SPECIFIC FIRE HAZARD THEY HAVE THE DISCRETION TO DENY THAT PROPOSED PROJECT IF THERE IS NO WAY TO MITIGATE THE HAZARD OR ADVERSE IMPACT IN THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT IS IMPORTANT AS WE ALL KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT SENATE BILL NINE STRIKES AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN RESPECTING LOCAL CONTROL. AND CREATING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE HOUSING OPTIONS IN PARTICULAR MORE OPTIONS FOR FAMILIES TO BUILD MULTI GENERATIONAL HOUSING TO BUILD MULTI GENERATIONAL ASSETS. INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH IS A CURRENCY THAT WE KNOW IS CRUCIAL CRUCIAL TO COUNTERING INEQUITY CREATING SOCIAL MOBILITY ESPECIALLY ESPECIALLY IN NEIGHBORHOODS WERE OUTDATED ZONING LAWS HAVE CREATED BARRIERS TO AFFORDABLE HOME OWNERSHIP AND HAVE LED TO OVERCROWDING LET'S BE FRANK CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS IS A CRISIS SO LARGE THAT THERE IS NO ONE SINGLE SOLUTION NO BILL IS NO BILL WILL BE A SILVER BULLET. BUT THERE ARE BILLS THEIR BILLS THAT WILL HELP MOVE THE NEEDLE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THERE ARE BILLS THAT OFFER SOLUTIONS. A PATH FORWARD. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BILLS THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IS TO INTERVENE TO INTERVENE WHEN THERE IS A CRISIS. TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE'S VOICES ARE HEARD TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY ON A COMPROMISE AND ULTIMATELY TO MAKE PROGRESS ON ISSUES AND ESPECIALLY ON ISSUES OF CRISIS THE BOTTOM LINE SENATE BILL NINE WILL PROVIDE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MORE WORKING FAMILIES TO ACHIEVE THE CALIFORNIA DREAM AND MAKES THE PATH TO HOME OWNERSHIP IN OUR STATE A MORE INCLUSIVE ONE. FOR ALL THESE REASONS RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I VOTE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER THANK YOU MISS REAVIS AND MISTER HOLDEN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS TODAY I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB NINE. THIS BILL ALLOWS GRADUAL DENSITY INCREASES IN ALREADY DEVELOPED NEIGHBORHOODS BUT EXAMS THE STORE DISTRICTS. THIS WILL KEEP PEOPLE CLOSE TO JOB CENTERS AND TRANSIT DECREASE COMMUTE TIMES AND SLOW DOWN DEVELOPMENT INTO WILDLIFE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT SB NINE DOES NOT ALLOW SIX UNITS ON A SINGLE LOT THE CAMPUS FOR UNITS. NOT FOR UNITS PLUS EIGHTY USE FOR UNITS TOTAL INCLUDING A TO USE SOME OF MY CONSTITUENTS ARE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT DEVELOPERS COMING IN TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK AND CHANGING THE CHARACTER OF THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD CITIES WILL HAVE LOCAL CONTROL IN THE AUTHORITY TO DENY A PROPOSED HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AT THE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT POSES A RISK TO PUBLIC HEALTH. OR SAFETY RECENT AMENDMENTS ALSO REQUIRE THAT THE OWNER OF THE RITUAL LOT SIGN AN AFFIDAVIT STATING THAT THEY WILL LIVE ON ONE OF THE LOTS. AFTER THE LOT SPLIT FOR AT LEAST THREE YEARS ALSO NOTHING IN THIS BILL PRECLUDES LOCAL GOVERNMENT FROM CHARGING IMPACT FEES FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION AS A RESULT OF A PROJECT UNDER SB NINE TO DECREASED IMPACT ON INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THESE REASONS I SUPPORT SB. NINE. TECHNISCHE HOLDEN MR SAY ARE TELL YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER ACTUALLY I MUST ARISE IN OPPOSITION OF SB NINE. SB NINE CAN BE CALLED COMMUNITY PLANNING CHAOS BECAUSE WHAT IT DOES IS RETROACTIVELY FOR COMMUNITIES LIKE THE ONES I REPRESENT THAT ARE LESS THAN THIRTY YEARS OLD WHAT IT DOES IS IT IT MAKES ALL OF THE PLANNING ALL THE MASTER PLANNING ALL THE SEAT WAS. ENVIRONMENTAL APPROVALS THAT WENT INTO MAKING THOSE COMMUNITIES- ENABLING THEM TO HAVE THE DEVELOPMENT THEY HAVE TODAY. IT LAYS TO WASTE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT HAVE BEEN SPENT DOING THAT. IT ALSO WILL AFFECT FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AS THEY HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. THE DOUBLING OF THE POPULATION THAT IS JUST THE POTENTIAL FOR HAVING TO. TWO HOUSES ON ONE LOT FOR ALL OF THESE SINGLE FAMILY DEVELOPMENT. WHICH MEANS IT WILL IMPACT THE APPROVALS OF FUTURE HIGH DENSITY PROJECTS. FUTURE COMMERCIAL PROJECT IT LAYS TO WASTE OUR EFFORTS TO HAVE APPROVED TO TRAFFIC CIRCULATION PLANS AIR QUALITY PLAN APPROVALS WATER AND SEWER INFRASTRUCTURE PARKING AN EMERGENCY VEHICLE ACCESS IN OTHER DEVELOPMENTS AS I'VE STATED BEFORE. THIS TAKES MANY COMMUNITIES THAT ARE LESS THAN THIRTY YEARS OLD OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE VERY REGULATIONS THAT WE CREATED HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE WE'RE JUST GONNA PUSH THAT ASIDE PUSH AWAY THOSE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE FORCE THOSE COMMUNITIES TO SPAN INSTEAD OF BUILDING BUILDING OUT THEIR STREETS AND BUILDING OUT THESE OTHER THINGS. THEY FORCED THEM TO SPEND A MONTH PLANS THAT WE CREATED WE'RE GONNA THROW THOSE ASIDE AND TELL THESE COMMUNITIES YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF YOUR COMMUNITY. SO THAT WE CAN SOLVE A PROBLEM. THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE SOLVED BY THIS WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM OF WHY WE CAN'T BUILD HOUSES IN CALIFORNIA. WHY WE CAN'T BRING IN BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT THOSE UNDERLYING CAUSES HAVE TO DO WITH OUR REQUIREMENTS OUR REGULATIONS IF WE'RE NOT GOING TO ADDRESS THAT THINGS LIKE THIS ARE JUST BANDAIDS THAT WON'T WORK SO FOR THOSE REASONS. I HAVE TO I HAVE TO ASK FOR YOU KNOW VOTE ON SB NINE THANK YOU DAVIS AIRTEL MISTER MATHIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS AYE I RISE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS MEASURE. AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY BECAUSE WE WE'VE HEARD BOTH SIDES OF THIS ALREADY ON THIS DEBATE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT DEVELOPERS ARE GONNA COME IN THEY'RE GOING TO TURN UP MY NEIGHBORHOOD THINGS ARE GONNA CHANGE WE'VE ALREADY DONE THE IMPACTS OF THE ON THE ENVIRONMENT WE'VE DONE THIS. AS WE'VE ALSO ALREADY HEARD THERE'VE BEEN AMENDMENTS ON THIS LEGISLATION TO ENSURE THAT THE CITY'S CAN DENY THE ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PROJECT BASED ON THOSE SAME CONCERNS THERE'VE BEEN MITIGATION ASPECTS WORKED INTO THIS IF YOU HAVE AN H. AWAY THIS ISN'T FOR YOU THIS ISN'T BIG GUYS COMING IN AND TEARING UP YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD NOW I KNOW SOME PEOPLE MIGHT FEEL THAT WAY I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN AND THERE'S FRANKLY WAY TOO MUCH MISCOMMUNICATION OUT THERE I TALKED TO MY LOCALS I GOT SOME LOCALS ALIKE AND I GOT SOME LOCALS WHO DON'T. BECAUSE OF THE MISCOMMUNICATION THAT'S HAPPENING I THINK THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SALINAS VALLEY TOUCHED ON SOME REALLY GOOD POINTS ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS IN THE MITIGATIONS PUT INTO THIS. MY COLLEAGUE FROM LA TOUCHED ON A GREAT POINT THIS IS FOR LOTS YOU HAVE TO STAY THERE FOR THREE YEARS. THIS IS BASED TO HELP. LOW INCOME PEOPLE LIKE IN MY AREA WHO HAVE THESE OLD FAMILY LOSS I HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THIS THINK SO YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE CREATE THAT GENERATIONAL WEALTH I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BUILD SOME. EQUITY FOR THE FAMILY AND BE ABLE TO DO THAT THIS ISN'T. THE PEOPLE GOING TO GO IN TO YOUR BIG SUBDIVISION THAT THE YOU'VE BUILDING FOR ALL THIS OTHER STUFF IF YOU'RE IN AN AREA THAT'S GROWING. THAT'S BUILDING UP THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S NOT REALLY EVEN GOING TO AFFECT YOU THIS IS FOR OUR POPULATIONS WORDS SO DANCE. AND THERE'S NOT GROWTH GOING ON WE'LL HAVE A FEW OF THOSE BLOTTO YOU MEMBERS MIGHT BE BIGGEST FRUSTRATION WITH THIS BILL IS THE DAM MISCOMMUNICATION ON BECAUSE I'VE HEARD ALL THE ARGUMENTS I'VE LOOKED AT IT I'VE READ IT I'VE TALKED TO THE AUTHOR OF TALK TO PEOPLE IN OPPOSITION OF TALKED EVERYBODY AT HOME. AND AGAIN SOME PEOPLE LIKE IT SOME PEOPLE DON'T IF YOU DON'T MAYBE IT'S OKAY VOTE NO I GET IT WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT DISTRICTS BERNIE MY DISTRICT MY LOCAL THAT I'VE TALKED TO. EVEN THOUGH IT'S A MIXED BAG THERE ARE THE MITIGATION STEPS THAT WILL HELP YOUR CITY CAN STILL DENY THIS YOU STILL HAVE SOME OF THAT LOCAL CONTROL. THINK ABOUT A MEMBERS. THIS CREATES GENERATIONAL EQUITY THIS CREATES GENERATIONAL GROWTH. I ASK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS THANK YOU MISTER MATHIS MISSED WICKS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS- MY COLLEAGUES FROM SALINAS AND PASADENA HAVE ARTICULATED MANY OF THE REASONS WHY I'M A PROUD SUPPORTER OF THIS BILL AND I WILL SAY IT'S NOT OFTEN ME AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE CELL ACTUALLY AGREE ON SOMETHING SO I STAND WITH HIM IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AS WELL. AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF MISTRUTHS ABOUT THIS BILL THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN ARTICULATED MANY SAY I SAT IN A HOUSING COMMITTEE AND HEARD A LOT OF THIS INFORMATION COMING THROUGH HOUSING COMMITTEE AND THERE'S A LOT OF INACCURACIES BY THE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. PEOPLE HAVE SAID THIS WILL RESULT IN SIX EIGHT TEN UNITS PER LOT AND THAT IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE AS YOU'VE HEARD FOR MAXIMUM INCLUDING EIGHTY USE PEOPLE SAY THIS WILL LEAD TO WIDESPREAD DEVELOPMENT BY CORPORATE LANDLORDS NOT TRUE RECENT AMENDMENTS REQUIRE THAT. THE SPLIT LOTS BE OWNEROCCUPIED FOR THREE YEARS TO PROTECT AGAINST THE SORT OF SPECULATION AND DISPLACEMENT PEOPLE SAY THAT THIS WILL OVERRIDE LOCAL LAWS REGARDING DESIGN STANDARDS ALSO NOT TRUE ANY LOCAL ORDINANCE RELATED TO SET BACKS HEIGHTS LANDSCAPING DESIGNER OTHER RESTRICTIONS THAT APPLY TO SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. WILL STILL APPLY IN THIS BILL PEOPLE SAY THAT THIS IS GOING TO RESULT IN HIGH DENSITY DEVELOPMENTS IN IN HIGH RISK FIRE AREAS ALSO NOT TRUE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN STILL DENY HOUSING PROJECTS AND HIGH FIRE ZONES THIS IS SMART POLICY EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US ON THIS FLOOR HAS THAT AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO BUILD MORE HOUSING. NO ONE THINKS WE DON'T HAVE TO BILL RIGHT NOW IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY VOTE FOR THAT TO VOTE FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN TO BUILD MORE% HOUSING WE NEED MORE SOLUTIONS IN THE STATE. RIGHT NOW IN TWO THIRDS OF CALIFORNIA- MULTI FAMILY HOUSING- MISSING MIDDLE HOUSING IS ILLEGAL LET'S LEGALIZE HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA AND VOTE FOR SB NINE. THANK YOU MS WICKS MEMBERS IF YOU'D LIKE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE BAY PLEASE RAISE YOUR MICROPHONES AT THIS TIME. PLEASE RAISE YOUR MICROPHONES AT THIS TIME. IF YOU WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN DEBATE MR GRAYSON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL NINE FIND OUT YOU'VE LIKELY HEARD ALL ABOUT THE DETAILS OF THIS BILL FROM BOTH SIDES HOW WE CAN ONLY RESULT IN A MAXIMUM OF FOUR UNITS ON A LOT THAT WAS SPLIT HOW IT PROTECTS AGAINST DISPLACEMENT AND SPECULATION. HOW CITIES RETAIN LOCAL CONTROL THROUGH OBJECTIVE PLANNING STANDARDS LIKE BUILDING HEIGHT SETBACKS AND LOT COVERAGE. YOU'VE SEEN A RIGOROUS ACADEMIC ANALYSIS FROM UC BERKELEY WHICH FOUND THAT THIS BILL WOULD CREATE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR DEVELOPMENT. ON AROUND ONE HUNDRED AND TEN PART THOUSAND PARCELS. THAT'S A GREAT OUTCOME. BUT ONE THE ONLY REPRESENTS ONE POINT 5% OF SINGLE FAMILY PARCELS STATEWIDE HARDLY THE ELIMINATION OF SINGLE FAMILY ZONING. WHAT I WOULD ASK YOU TO CONSIDER TODAY IS NOT JUST WHAT THIS BILL DOES. BUT WHY WE ARE DOING IT WE DON'T BUILD HOUSING FOR HOUSING SAKE WE DON'T BUILD HOUSING TO MEET OUR READING THE NUMBERS WERE DISSATISFIED DEVELOPERS OR ADVOCATES OR EVEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WE BUILD HOUSING FOR MORE BASIC REASONS FAMILY COMMUNITY AN OPPORTUNITY. THE CHANCE TO GROW YOUR NEST EGG THE CHANCE TO AGE WITH DIGNITY IN YOUR HOME THE CHANCE TO HAVE YOUR CHILDREN AND GRAND CHILDREN GROW UP IN THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD. THAT YOU DID THESE ARE THINGS THAT MAKE A COMMUNITY A COMMUNITY. TO THOSE WORRIED ABOUT THE CHARACTER OF YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD. THINK ABOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD YOU GREW UP IN THINK ABOUT WHAT IT MEANT TO RIDE YOUR BIKE TO YOUR FRIEND'S HOUSE. TO GO SEE GRANDMA TO WALK TO SCHOOL WITH YOUR CLASSMATES. THESE EXPERIENCES ARE THE FOUNDATION OF CIVIC IDENTITY AND WE ARE DENYING AN ENTIRE GENERATION ACCESS TO THEM WE DENIED THEM. AT OUR PERIL DO YOU WONDER WHY OUR POLITICS SO DIVISIVE WHY ARE EMPATHY IS SO LOW. THERE IS A REASON THEY SAY THAT CHARITY STARTS AT THE HOME. BUT IT'S PRETTY HARD TO FEEL TERRIBLE WHEN YOU'RE PAYING OVER HALF YOUR INCOME TO RENT. LIKE MORE THAN ONE IN FIVE HOUSEHOLDS IN CALIFORNIA. WE BUILD HOUSING BECAUSE HOUSING GROSS COMMUNITIES DID YOU KNOW THAT READ READ THREE REDWOOD TREES. AS MASSIVE AS THEY ARE HAVE VERY SHALLOW ROOTS. DESPITE THE FACT THE BIG ROAD TO BE HUNDREDS OF YEARS HUNDREDS OF FEET HIGH AND LIVE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. THE ROOT SYSTEMS ONLY GO DOWN TEN OR FIFTEEN FEET. THEIR STRENGTHS AND THEIR LONGEVITY COMES NOT FROM DEATH BUT BECAUSE THE INTERTWINED THEIR ROOTS IN A NETWORK WITH OF THE REDWOODS. THE TREES LITERALLY HOLD EACH OTHER UP WITH THIS STRATEGY OF MUTUAL SUPPORT. THEY CAN WITHSTAND FLOODS MASSIVE FIRES DROUGHT WIND AND YES EVEN EARTHQUAKES. AND IT'S NO pCHALLENGES WE FACE IN OUR STATE REQUIRE A SIMILAR SURVIVAL STRATEGY. FAR FROM WEAKENING OUR NEIGHBORHOODS THIS BILL WILL MAKE THEM STRONGER MORE RESILIENT MORE INCLUSIVE. THIS CAN ONLY BE A GOOD THING FOR CALIFORNIA AND FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ENCOURAGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU MISS GRAYSON MS CLARK SILVA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS MEMBERS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF S. B. NINE ONCE AGAIN I STAND HERE WITH A VERY VERY DIFFICULT CHALLENGE AND SOMETIMES STEPPING AWAY FROM MY COLLEAGUES EVEN IN MY OWN COUNTY. THE TRUTH IS BEING ON THE HOUSING COMMITTEE WORKING ON HOMELESSNESS ARE ALL INTERSECTIONS WE CANNOT ACHIEVE WHAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE WITH THE HOMELESS CRISIS UNLESS WE BUILD HOMES SIMPLY WE ARE BUILDING HOMES AT A RATE THAT IS SLOWER THAN ON OUR NINETEEN FORTIES AND NINETEEN SIXTIES. NOW I HAVE HEARD THE CONCERNS. AND THE NARRATIVE IS OUT OF CONTROL SIMPLY MEANS MEANING GETTING EMAILS SAYING WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO. RUIN OUR SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS WHY DON'T YOU CARE ABOUT DENSITY OUT OF CONTROL THIS BILL WILL DO NOTHING TO HELP WITH SOLVING OUR HOMELESS CRISIS FRIENDS THOSE ARE ALL UNTRUE THOSE ARE ALL UNTRUE PLEASE READ THE BILL LANGUAGE PLEASE LOOK AT THE AMENDMENTS AND PLEASE THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU ARE A PROPERTY OWNER THAT COMES WITH HAVING SOME ABILITIES TO MAKE CHOICES ON YOUR OWN PROPERTY. MANY TIMES WE HEARD WITH THE EIGHTY USE OR GRANNY FLATS OF YOU WANT TO CALL ON THAT AND THE LAST HANDFUL OF YEARS THOSE WERE GOING TO BE BUILT OUT OF CONTROL WE'RE GONNA HAVE A RUN ON EIGHTY USE I ASK EACH ONE OF YOU LEGISLATORS TO CALL YOUR CITIES FIND OUT HOW MANY PERMITS HAVE BEEN PULLED. AND HOW MANY HAVE BEEN BUILT JUST ON THE AD USE YOU ARE GOING TO FIND OUT THAT THERE ARE MORE THAN HAVE BEEN BUILT BUT NOT EVEN CLOSE TO DOUBLING. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS BILL WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A RUN ON SINGLE FAMILIES WITH TWELVE UNITS. AS WAS STATED THERE'S A COMBINATION OF A DO YOU AND EVEN SPLITTING LOTS WITH A TOTAL OF FOUR. IN ADDITION SOME OF THE NEW AMENDMENTS PROTECT. NOT ONLY OUR ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS OR COASTAL CONCERNS BUT ALSO FIRE AS WE SAID HAZARDS. THEY COMPLY WITH LOCAL DESIGN THIS BILL IS A STEP IS ONLY PART OF THE PACKAGE WE NEED WE HAVE OTHER BILLS NOT ONE OF THEM AS HAS BEEN SAID WILL SOLVE OUR CRISIS FOR NOT ONLY HOMELESS DEATH BUT HOMEWORK OWNERSHIP BUT ALL OF THEM ARE TOOLS THAT GIVE THE HOME OWNER THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THIS THERE'S NO MANDATE HERE. THERE IS NO MANDATE THAT A SINGLE FAMILY HOMEOWNER WOULD NEED TO SPLIT THEIR LOT OR BUILD. IT'S NOT OPPORTUNITY TO STREAMLINE AND MOVE FORWARD FINALLY. MANY OF US HERE ON THIS FLOOR OUR HOMEOWNERS SOMEWHERE IN OUR FAMILY THERE WAS HOME PURCHASED MAYBE BY YOUR GRANDPARENTS MAYBE BY YOUR OWN PARENTS. AND BECAUSE OF THAT HOMEOWNERSHIP YOU INSTANTLY MOVED INTO A CLASS THAT IS A SMALL CLASS AND THAT IS THE CLASS OF OWNING A HOME. BECAUSE YOU OWN A HOME YOU WERE PACKING YOUR BAGS AND MOVING FROM APARTMENT TO APARTMENT NEIGHBORHOOD TO NEIGHBORHOOD AND YOU WERE ABLE TO PUT DOWN ROOTS. NOT ONLY OWNING YOUR HOME MEETING THEIR NEIGHBORS GROWING UP WITH CHILDREN ON YOUR SAME PER BLOCK BECOMING LIFELONG FRIENDS AND INVESTING IN YOUR COMMUNITY THAT'S WHAT A HOMEOWNER DOES AND MANY MANY OF OUR CALIFORNIANS ARE BLOCKED FROM THAT OPPORTUNITY. THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE THAT AMERICAN DREAM THAT CALIFORNIA DREAM BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO ACCESS TO HOMEOWNERSHIP BECAUSE OUR PRICES ARE SKYROCKETING WE WANT TO OPEN THAT DOOR LITERALLY A DOOR THEN WE NEED TO BUILD AND WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD AND I DO SUPPORT SB NINE. THANK YOU MISS CLARK SILVA MISTER FLORA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB NINE AND FOR A LONG TIME THAT WE SPOKE ON THE FLOOR ABOUT A BIGGER COLLEAGUES IN SOME OF THE BIGGER THE MORE. URBAN AREAS THAT IF THEY DO NOT FIX THEIR PROBLEMS THEY WILL BECOME OUR PROBLEMS IN A MORE RURAL- DISTRICTS THIS BILL. TAKES A STEP TO ADDRESS THAT THIS BILL IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IS A PERFECT ABSOLUTELY NOT. FOR YEARS WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE GROUPS THAT DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP PROJECT TO STOP- DEVELOPMENTS UNDER LEGISLATION UNDER LAWSUITS UNDER SEQUEL. THIS BILL ADDRESSES THAT BUILDERS ALSO ONE OTHER THING THERE'S THIS WEIRD CONCEPT IN ECONOMICS CALL SUPPLYING DEMAND IT'S VERY INTERESTING WHEN YOU CAN SELL A TWELVE HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT HOUSE IN IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR WHATEVER YOU CAN COME TO MY DISTRICT. BYE HOUSE FOR TOP DOLLAR WELL GUESS WHAT YOU'VE DONE YOU DISPLAY SOMEBODY IN MY COMMUNITY MY COMMUNITY CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO LIVE THERE ANYMORE IT'S TIME THAT WE ALLOW OUR URBAN AREAS TO DO WITH THEY THINK THEY NEED TO DO TO FIX THEIR PROBLEMS SO FRIENDS I KNOW THIS BILL IS CHALLENGING FOR SOME BUT FOR THOSE OF US THAT REPRESENT RURAL DISTRICTS I DO SUPPORT THIS- THERE'S A REASON WHY RC RC SUPPORTS THIS BILL AS WELL. AND I ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE ALL YOUR SUPPORT AND APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU MISS FLORA MR LEE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THAN YOU COLLEAGUES I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB NINE I JUST WANT TO BRIEFLY I THANK MY COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE AISLE THAT WE ARE AGREEING ON SOMETHING TODAY AND WE I DO AGREE WE NEED TO BE FIXING URBAN PROBLEMS TO MAKE SURE DOESN'T SPRAWL OUT AND FOR ONE VERY CLEAR REASON IS THIS IS. FOR ALL THE CALIFORNIANS OF MY AGE MY GENERATION OR EVEN YOUNGER WE ARE GIVING UP THE IDEA OF THE CALIFORNIA DREAM IT IS MUCH MORE ATTAINABLE TO ATTAIN A HOMEOWNERSHIP DREAM PERHAPS IN RURAL AREAS OF CALIFORNIA OR OTHER STATES ENTIRELY AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE SEEING DECLINING ENROLLMENTS ESPECIALLY EVEN IN MY DISTRICT WHERE WE'RE NOT HAVING KIDS ANYMORE. WE ARE IN RUNNING OUT OF YOUNG STUDENTS TO KEEP OUR PIPELINE STRONG AND ONE DAY ONE DAY WILL HELP WILL NOT HAPPEN IS WE'LL DRIVE EVERYONE AWAY THE TALENT THAT WE HAVE CULTIVATED THAT WE HAVE GROWN IN CALIFORNIA WILL MOVE AWAY TO OTHER STATES AND THAT IS A FORTY SOMETHING THAT IS ALWAYS ON THE TOP OF MY TO MANY PEOPLE. AND I THINK ABOUT SB NINE IS BEING SOMETHING VERY EMPOWERING TO A LOT OF FAMILIES IN MY DISTRICT WHERE THERE ARE FOUR GENERATIONS OF IMMIGRANT FAMILIES LIVING UNDER ONE SINGLE FAMILY HOUSE AND THAT IS NOT A PRACTICAL NECESSITY. IS NOT OUT OF COMFORT IT'S NOT HELD OF THE DESIRE TO BE REALLY CLOSE ON TOP OF EACH OTHER ALTHOUGH I'M SOME I'M SURE MANY FAMILIES LOVE EACH OTHER THAT CLOSELY. IT IS NOT THAT DESIRE THAT IS THE PRACTICAL REALITY OF MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS IN THE WEALTHY SILICON VALLEY IN THE BAY AREA WHERE PEOPLE ARE MAKING IN THE SIX FIGURES BUT STILL CANNOT ATTAIN ANY SORT OF HOMEOWNERSHIP OR SPACE THEY NEED TO LIVE IN I'M NOT SHY ABOUT TELLING THIS THE FOLKS THAT I STILL LIVE WITH MY FAMILY. AT HOME IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO PRACTICALLY LIVE IN OUR AREA WHERE MOST PEOPLE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO DREAM OF HOMEOWNERSHIP I WAS TALKING TO A COLLEAGUE OF MY FROM ANOTHER STATE OR TALK ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF STARTER HOME AND NOT FORCED I FORGOT. WHAT THAT CONCEPT EVEN IS FOR MOST OF OUR GENERATION A WE JUST ATTAIN HOMEOWNERSHIP AT ALL I KNOW IN PREVIOUS GENERATIONS THERE'S IDEA OF LEVELING UP IN HOMES HOMEOWNERSHIP AND WE DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT THAT ALL. B. EVERY YEAR THAT WE DO NOT ACT ON THIS HOUSING CRISIS AND OF COURSE SB NINE IS NOT AVAILABLE AS WELL AS KNOWLEDGE IT IS A STEP IN THE DIRECTION WE NEED ME MORE AND MORE GENERATIONS OF CALIFORNIA WILL LOSE HOPE IN CALIFORNIA. AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE MORE OF OUR FAMILIES MOVE AWAY MORE FAMILIES BEING PRICED OUT. WHATEVER REGION THEY'RE LEAVING CALIFORNIA. SO I HOPEFULLY OR JR I VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MICHELINE. MEMBERS I'D TRY THIS ONE MORE TIME. IF YOU WANT TO PARTICIPATE DEBATE RAGING MICROPHONES RIGHT NOW. MISTER NAZARIAN YOUR RESIDENTS. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. COLLEAGUES I MUST RISE IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL. I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE ALL THE EFFORT THAT'S GONE INTO THIS I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS BUT THE REALITY IS THAT WHEN. SEVENTY SIX POINT 2% OF HOUSEHOLDS AGE FIFTY AND OVER AND SEVENTY EIGHT POINT 7% OF HOUSEHOLDS EACH SIXTY FIVE AND OVER. HOMEOWNERS RELY ON THAT SINGLE FAMILY PROPERTY THAT THEY ARE LIVING IN AS THEIR PRIMARY INVESTMENT. WE'RE GOING TO BE DEVASTATING THAT INVESTMENT. I'M JUST BASING THIS ON NUMBERS I'M BASING IT ON WHERE THINGS ARE GOING TO BE HEADED WE'VE SEEN THINGS LIKE THIS BEFORE THERE'S GONNA BE A UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE AND IT'S GOING TO BE DEVASTATING TO THE VERY PEOPLE WHO WE NEED TO PROTECT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE INCOME COMING IN. IT MIGHT WORK FOR THE FIRST FIVE TEN YEARS. IT MIGHT ALLOW SOME OF THEM TO BE ABLE TO SELL OUT AND MOVE IT MOVE AWAY BUT IT'S GOING TO BE DEVASTATING FOR ANYBODY ELSE THAT'S IN THAT AGE RANGE. THAT'S GONNA NEED TO HOLD ON TO THE HOUSE BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO AFTER THEY SELL THE HOUSE. PLEASE THINK ABOUT THIS CONSEQUENCE WE'RE ALREADY SEEING. THE GREAT AGING TSUNAMI COME COME TO COME TO FRUITION BEFORE OUR EYES. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS THE AGE RANGE OF OUR ELDERLY CALIFORNIANS SIXTY PLUS HAS ALREADY INCREASED BY ALMOST 3% SO FROM 11% TO FOURTEEN. AND IN THE NEXT TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS IT'S GONNA GO UP 225% WE'RE GOING TO BE DEVASTATING THIS VERY TRUNCHEON OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE RELYING ON THEIR HOMES TO BE THEIR NEST EGGS. AND WE TALK SOMEONE BROUGHT UP GENERATIONAL WEALTH COLLEAGUES I'M AN IMMIGRANT. WHO'S BOUGHT HIS HOUSE I AM THAT GENERATION WHO'S TRYING TO DEVELOP THE GENERATIONAL WEALTH AFTER WE LOST EVERYTHING IN A WAR FORTY YEARS AGO WHEN WE IMMIGRATED TO THE UNITED STATES I UNDERSTAND WITH GENERATIONAL WEALTH AND ITS LOSS MEANS AND I'M TRYING TO BUILD IT RIGHT NOW FOR MY KIDS THIS ISN'T GOING TO HELP THIS WORKS COUNTER TO THAT. SHORT TERM IT'LL WORK LONG TERM IT'LL BE DEVASTATING. WE TALK ABOUT DISTRICTS THAT ARE LARGE ENOUGH TO ABSORB THIS MIGHT THE ASSEMBLY DISTRICT I HAVE THE HONOR OF REPRESENTING DISTRICT FORTY SIX. IN COMPARISON TO MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE EITHER OF MY TWO GOOD COLLEAGUES FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHETHER DISTRICT ONE OR WHETHER DISTRICT TWO. IS A FING A PINKY SIZE FINGERNAIL COMPARED TO WHAT THOSE DISTRICTS ARE BECAUSE WE ARE DENSE. WHICH MEANS THAT THE DENSITY IS GONNA BE MISHANDLED WHEN THE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES ARE SUBDIVIDED. IT'S ONE THING TO BUILD UP IT'S ANOTHER THING TO CONTINUE THE SPRAWL IN DISTRICTS LIKE MINE. SO I UNDERSTAND THE PRESSURES I UNDERSTAND THE DAY THIS VOTE IS COMING ON ALSO. IT'S WRITTEN WE'RE GONNA LEAVE THESE JOBS AT SOME POINT WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK AND LIVE IN OUR COMMUNITIES I INTERNET I INTEND TO GROW OLD IN MY COMMUNITY AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT COMMUNITY GO DOWN HILL BECAUSE IT WILL IN TWENTY YEARS WHEN WE HAVEN'T DEALT WITH THE PLANNING OF CONSEQUENCES OF BILLS LIKE THIS WE HAVEN'T DEALT WITH THE UTILITY WE HAVEN'T DEALT DEALT WITH THE TRANSPORTATION WE HAVEN'T DEALT WITH PARKING WE HAVEN'T DEALT WITH A LOT OF THE NEEDS THAT GO INTO COMPLEMENTING WHAT INCREASED HOUSING MEANS. WE'RE GOING TO BE DEVASTATING THOSE COMMUNITIES THIRTY SECONDS BUSINESS AREA THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR US TO VOTE NO AGAINST THIS BILL. MISTER JONES SAWYER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER BOB TODAY I'M IN SUPPORT OF SB NINE AND QUITE FRANKLY I WAS ALL OVER THE MAP OF THE REGIONALLY FOR S. B. NINE WHEN I START ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BILL I WENT TO NOT VOTING AND THEN WHEN I START ASKING MORE QUESTIONS. ABOUT THE BILL. ALSO ANGERED I WAS AT A NO BUT AFTER TALKING WITH THE AUTHOR FINALLY LISTENED TO MY CONCERNS TO FINALLY LISTEN TO PEOPLE OF COLOR'S CONCERNS AND FINALLY LISTEN TO MY DISTRICT CONCERNS AND ADDED AMENDMENTS THAT ADDRESSED THOSE CONCERNS I BECAME AND I AND THOSE CONCERNS WERE GENTRIFICATION DENSITY AND WHEN I CALL PRICES SEGREGATION ANY AUTHORED GREED WITH ME THAT HOUSING BILLS AND SUBSEQUENT LOSS THEY DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE ALL WORSE AVOID THE UNCONSTITUTIONAL SEGREGATION GENTRIFICATION AND WEALTH STAGNATION THAT. THAT WILL PERPETUATE KEEPING PEOPLE OF COLOR DOWN BECAUSE THIS HOUSING IS THE PRINCIPLE GAP BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CONSIDERED DISADVANTAGED AND POOR PEOPLE WHO ARE WEALTHY AND SHE'S AGREED TO WORK WITH ME AS WE COME UP WITH OUR OWN PLAN. FOR HOW WE DEAL WITH THOSE THREE THINGS BECAUSE IN MY DISTRICT WHERE MOST OF THE LAND BECAUSE OF THE HOUSING DROP WE HAD THAT CRISIS MOSTLY LAND IS OWNED BY CORPORATIONS AND SO GENTRIFICATION IS REAL SOUTH LA BEING WHITE AGAIN IS VERY REAL. DENSITY YOU CAN'T PUT MORE DANCE YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T SEE MORE DENSER AREA THAN MINE AND SHE AGREED WITH ME WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT IN A WAY THAT. ALL INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY NOT HAVE THE FINANCIAL CAPACITY TO MOVE INTO OTHER AREAS WOULD HAVE MORE ROOM THAT YOU DON'T END UP IN THE SAME AREA AND THEN WHEN I CALL PRICE SEGREGATION. THAT'S A GREAT WAY FOR KEEPING PEOPLE OF COLOR OUT OF CERTAIN AREAS BY NOT SAYING YOU CAN'T MOVE HERE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO COME HERE AND THEN YOU KEEP ALL OF US TOGETHER IN ONE PLACE AFTER PLACE. I'VE LOOKED AT AND I'VE TALKED TO THE AUTHOR ABOUT HER BILL AND HOW WE CAN ADD ON TOP OF THAT SO WE CAN ADDRESS MY CONCERNS LIKE PUBLIC HOUSING WHICH IT BECOME TO GHETTOS OF OUR COMMUNITY RATIOS STILL WE HAVE RACIAL ZONING IN SOME AREAS THAT WE NEED TO GET RID OF HOMEOWNERSHIP WHICH IS KEPT POOR BLACK AND BROWN INDIVIDUALS IN A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN NEVER ACHIEVE THE AMERICAN DREAM WHITE FLIGHT YES WHITE FLIGHT LEAVING AREAS SO THAT IT GOES DOWN IN VALUE BECAUSE OR THEY TELL PEOPLE DON'T MOVE TO THIS AREA BECAUSE AN AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO WILL MOVE INTO THAT AREA SUPPRESS INCOMES KEEPING PEOPLE ON EDUCATED AND POOR IN ONE AREA OF LIKE HOUSING PROJECTS IS A PROBLEM THAT WE NEED TO SOLVE RACIAL COVENANTS LOCAL TACTICS BANKS THAT RED LINE INSURANCE COMPANIES THE RED LINE ALL OF THAT WE NEED TO TAKE IN CONSIDERATION WHEN WE LOOK AT HOUSING THE REASON I'M UP ON THIS BILL IMBODEN YES. IT'S BECAUSE OF THE THREE YEAR RESIDENCY AND THAT LOCAL CONTROL AGENCIES NOT ONLY LOOK AT ENVIRONMENTAL BUT THEY LOOK AT THE ADVERSE IMPACTS AND I HOPE THAT THEY USE ALL OF THESE NOTES THAT I JUST MENTIONED IN THEIR EVALUATION ON WHETHER OR NOT THEY MOVE FORWARD I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR. FOR EVEN CONSIDERING IT BUT MOST IMPORTANT I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR PUTTING THOSE IN THIS BILL COULDN'T WE CAN BUILD ON THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN I BRING FOLKS TOGETHER THAT HOPEFULLY NEXT YEAR WE CAN BRING OUR OWN PEOPLE OF COLOR HOUSING ACT SO WE CAN ADDRESS ALL THOSE ISSUES ON TOP OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WHEN WE PASSED SB NINE THANK YOU THANK MISTER JONES SAWYER THIS CARILLO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I WASN'T SURE IF I WAS GONNA SHARE BUT I JUST LIKE TO ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM SOUTH LA ON GENTRIFICATION MY COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY DISTRICT FIFTY ONE HAS MOSTLY FOR A LONG TIME NOW- AND AGAIN MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED WHITE FLIGHT FROM THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES THAT FLED TO THE OUTSKIRTS OF INTO THE VALLEY AND OTHER PLACES AROUND THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES LEAVING THE URBAN CORE- IT MOSTLY FOR WORKING CLASS PEOPLE. OF MY COMMUNITY HAS FOR A LONG TIME BEEN A HISTORICALLY LATINO IMMIGRANT WORKING CLASS COMMUNITY WE ARE SEEN INCREDIBLE GENTRIFICATION WE HAD AT SOME POINT YOU TO FULL CRAFTSMAN HOMES ALONGSIDE SEVERAL DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES THAT HAD IN THE PAST DUE TO CITY ORDINANCE IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES BEEN CONVERTED A TWO STORY CRAFTSMAN HOME INTO A FOUR UNIT. APARTMENT- PLACE TO LIVE WHERE IMMIGRANT WORKING CLASS FAMILIES LIVED. THE GENTRIFICATION IN MY COMMUNITY THAT I'VE SEEN IS THAT THOSE FOR YOU AND IT CRESSMAN HOME THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN CONVERTED INTO A FOR APARTMENT COMPLEX. ARE BEING REVERSED BACK INTO SINGLE FAMILY HOMES DISPLACING. THE IMMIGRANT WORKING CLASS FAMILY THAT LIVE THERE. SO WE WENT FROM SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE EAST TO A FOUR UNIT RESIDENTS. NOW BACK TO A ONE UNIT RESIDENTS. DISPLACING COMMUNITIES AND INCREASING. FAMILY THAT ARE LEAVING LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK AND TO LIVING IN THEIR CARS ALONG FIVE PARKS IN MY COMMUNITY. NOT KNOWING WHERE THEIR KIDS ARE GOING TO GO TO SCHOOL WE HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM WE CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THE NEED OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE LACK OF HOUSING THE INCREASE OF OVER HOMELESSNESS AND ON HEALTH OF RESIDENTS IN OUR COMMUNITY. SOME OF IT VARIES FROM CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS TO RECENT DISPLACEMENT OF FAMILIES WE NEED TO ACT WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO SIMPLY SAY WE NEED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM AND THEN BE UNABLE TO MOVE FORWARD I AM DISAPPOINTED. IN MY OWN CITY AND THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES FOR PASSING A RESOLUTION AGAINST IT AT THE LAST MOMENT JUST LAST WEEK AND I WANT TO APPLAUD ONE OF MY OWN COUNCIL MEMBERS. FORMER SENATOR GIL VIDEO WHO STOOD STRONG IN SUPPORT OF SB NINE KNOWING. THAT IT IN OUR COMMUNITY IT IS OUR COMMUNITY THAT CONTINUES TO BUILD. WE HAVE THE MOST DENSITY A HUGE ISSUE WITH PARKING. A HUGE ISSUE OF DISPLACEMENT WITH FAMILIES WE CONTINUE TO BUILD IN THE PROBLEM CONTINUES TO GROW. SB NINE IS A MODEST SOLUTION. THATAT THE END OF THE DAY ALLOWS FOR LOCAL CONTROL. IT HAS AS MR. MY COLLEAGUE FROM SOUTH LA MENTION PROVISIONS THAT THE AUTHOR HAS PUT IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT WE COULD DO THIS IN AN EQUITABLE WAY. THE MISINFORMATION THE MISCOMMUNICATION THE LIVES THAT WERE SEEN ON SOCIAL MEDIA FROM PEOPLE THAT SAY YES WE WANT TO BUILD JUST DON'T BUILD HERE. BILL BUILT OVER THERE. ENOUGH WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO CONTINUE THE RHETORIC OF MISINFORMATION SO I STRONGLY URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE YES.

SHE'S WELL WANTS TO GROW OLD IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS GREAT STATE. AND I FOLDER SHOULD HAVE TO WORRY.
