WOULD COME INTO THE OFFICE AND

00:41:35.693 --> 00:41:37.228 region:rollup2

pOCCURRED. THAT SOMETIMES IN OUR

00:44:46.317 --> 00:44:49.820 region:rollup2
EFFORTS TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

00:44:48.019 --> 00:44:52.590 region:rollup2

OVER ALL OF THE FOLKS RIGHTS OR.

RUSTED DECISIONS THAT PROBABLY

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:58.863 region:rollup2
IF FOUGHT IF THEY HAD GONE

00:44:57.662 --> 00:45:00.698 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE NORMAL PROCESS WHICH

00:44:58.863 --> 00:45:02.233 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES TAKES TIME AND IS

00:45:00.698 --> 00:45:04.202 region:rollup2
ALWAYS AGITATING BECAUSE IT'S

00:45:02.233 --> 00:45:05.870 region:rollup2

.

00:45:09.307 --> 00:45:13.010 region:rollup2
OF THAT MAKE SENSE INITIALLY

00:45:11.042 --> 00:45:13.945 region:rollup2

00:45:26.824 --> 00:45:29.427 region:rollup2
PROCESS THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE

00:45:27.925 --> 00:45:30.995 region:rollup2
DON'T OR DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE

00:45:29.427 --> 00:45:32.597 region:rollup2
AN ENGAGING IN. DON'T FEEL THAT

00:45:30.995 --> 00:45:34.332 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY

00:45:32.597 --> 00:45:36.133 region:rollup2

THIS COMMITTEE.

00:46:51.642 --> 00:46:54.512 region:rollup2
AS IT'S BEEN EXPRESS THE

00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:55.746 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATION BY BY COLLEAGUES IS

00:46:54.512 --> 00:46:56.280 region:rollup2
IN THE DIFFICULT POSITION OF

00:46:55.746 --> 00:46:57.448 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH ONLY A SMALL

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:59.784 region:rollup2
SLIVER.

00:46:57.448 --> 00:47:02.386 region:rollup2
OF THAT IMPORTANT ISSUE AND.

00:46:59.784 --> 00:47:03.521 region:rollup2
I. UNDERSTAND THAT THAT

00:47:02.386 --> 00:47:04.955 region:rollup2
CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY THE

00:47:03.521 --> 00:47:05.556 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL THAT

00:47:04.955 --> 00:47:06.824 region:rollup2
THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE BEING

00:47:05.556 --> 00:47:08.492 region:rollup2
SINGLED OUT.

00:47:06.824 --> 00:47:09.627 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S A VALID

00:47:08.492 --> 00:47:11.595 region:rollup2
POINT AND AND I APPRECIATE THE

00:47:09.627 --> 00:47:12.129 region:rollup2
CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED BY MY

00:47:11.595 --> 00:47:14.098 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES.

00:47:12.129 --> 00:47:15.266 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY I THINK THERE'S A

00:47:14.098 --> 00:47:16.967 region:rollup2
BROAD AGREEMENT THAT THE

00:47:15.266 --> 00:47:18.402 region:rollup2
RESPONSE TO THE ME TOO MOVEMENT

00:47:16.967 --> 00:47:19.737 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE A COMPREHENSIVE.

00:47:18.402 --> 00:47:20.938 region:rollup2
AND WE ARE DOING OURSELVES ANY

00:47:19.737 --> 00:47:22.907 region:rollup2
FAVORS IF WE SIMPLY TARGET A

00:47:20.938 --> 00:47:23.708 region:rollup2
SMALL SLICE OF THE CAPITAL

00:47:22.907 --> 00:47:25.443 region:rollup2

REGULATIONS.

00:47:25.443 --> 00:47:27.778 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT WAS PART OF THE

00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:29.180 region:rollup2
SENTIMENT BEHIND THE CREATION OF

00:47:27.778 --> 00:47:30.481 region:rollup2
THE JOINT RULES SUBCOMMITTEE.

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:32.683 region:rollup2

IN RESPONSE.

00:47:32.683 --> 00:47:35.352 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS

00:47:33.851 --> 00:47:37.054 region:rollup2
ISSUE HOLISTICALLY AND TO

00:47:35.352 --> 00:47:38.289 region:rollup2
DEVELOP COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS

00:47:37.054 --> 00:47:39.690 region:rollup2
TO CHANGING THE COURTS OR ON

00:47:38.289 --> 00:47:41.559 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:43.060 region:rollup2
BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY ARE PART OF

00:47:41.559 --> 00:47:44.195 region:rollup2
THE LARGER CAPITAL COMMUNITY.

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:45.496 region:rollup2
ANY SOLUTION TO CHANGING THE

00:47:44.195 --> 00:47:47.431 region:rollup2
CULTURE ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT

00:47:45.496 --> 00:47:49.100 region:rollup2
MUST INVOLVE LOBBYISTS.

00:47:47.431 --> 00:47:50.668 region:rollup2
BUTTON THIS BILL IS VERY MUCH A

00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:52.303 region:rollup2
WORK IN PROGRESS.

00:47:50.668 --> 00:47:53.504 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE ARE LEGITIMATE

00:47:52.303 --> 00:47:56.073 region:rollup2
CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER THE F.

00:47:53.504 --> 00:47:57.174 region:rollup2

00:47:56.073 --> 00:47:59.210 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATING COMPLAINTS OF

00:47:57.174 --> 00:48:01.512 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT I'D I'D. AND

00:47:59.210 --> 00:48:03.114 region:rollup2
VERY SKEPTICAL THAT IT IS. A AND

00:48:01.512 --> 00:48:04.215 region:rollup2
EVEN IF THE F. PPC CAN FIGURE

00:48:03.114 --> 00:48:05.683 region:rollup2

00:48:04.215 --> 00:48:07.251 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATED THOSE COMPLAINTS.

00:48:05.683 --> 00:48:08.486 region:rollup2
I'M NOT SURE THAT THE PENALTIES

00:48:07.251 --> 00:48:09.687 region:rollup2
THAT ARE FOUNDIN THE POLITICAL

00:48:08.486 --> 00:48:10.254 region:rollup2
REFORM ACT ARE NECESSARILY THE

00:48:09.687 --> 00:48:12.323 region:rollup2
RIGHT REMEDIES

00:48:10.254 --> 00:48:13.724 region:rollup2
FOR THIS TYPE OF MISCONDUCT.

00:48:12.323 --> 00:48:14.558 region:rollup2
ON THE OTHER HAND BECAUSE THEY

00:48:13.724 --> 00:48:16.827 region:rollup2
ARE NOT EMPLOYEES OF THE

00:48:14.558 --> 00:48:17.661 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE THEIR CHALLENGES

00:48:16.827 --> 00:48:19.130 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW TO RESPOND TO

00:48:17.661 --> 00:48:21.565 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIATE THE COMPLAINTS OF

00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:22.333 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT. BY LOBBYISTS.

00:48:21.565 --> 00:48:23.768 region:rollup2
UNLIKE MEMBERS OF THE

00:48:22.333 --> 00:48:24.935 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE WHO CAN BE CENSURED

00:48:23.768 --> 00:48:27.271 region:rollup2
SUSPENDED OR EXPELLED FROM HIS

00:48:24.935 --> 00:48:28.806 region:rollup2

OTHER DISCIPLINARY STEPS TAKEN

00:48:31.909 --> 00:48:35.513 region:rollup2
AGAINST THEM. THE OPTIONS FOR

00:48:33.577 --> 00:48:36.981 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINARIAN THE OPTIONS FOR

00:48:35.513 --> 00:48:38.449 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINING LOBBYIST SOON GAYS

00:48:36.981 --> 00:48:39.750 region:rollup2
AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT ARE LESS

00:48:38.449 --> 00:48:41.318 region:rollup2
WELL DEFINED.

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:42.453 region:rollup2
SO I THINK A DISCUSSION ABOUT

00:48:41.318 --> 00:48:43.387 region:rollup2
THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO RESPOND

00:48:42.453 --> 00:48:45.322 region:rollup2

CONVERSATION WILL OCCUR IN THE

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:02.373 region:rollup2

01:10:23.119 --> 01:10:27.290 region:rollup2
LEGISLATORS LEGISLATURES TO

01:10:25.021 --> 01:10:27.890 region:rollup2
EMPOWER THEIR GOVERNORS TO MAKE

01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:28.825 region:rollup2
TEMPORARY APPOINTMENTS TO THE

01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:29.592 region:rollup2
SENATE.

01:10:28.825 --> 01:10:31.060 region:rollup2
THESE APPOINTMENTS IF THEY

01:10:29.592 --> 01:10:32.895 region:rollup2
OCCURRED AT ALL WERE ALWAYS

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:34.397 region:rollup2
MEANT TO BE JUST THAT TEMPORARY

01:10:32.895 --> 01:10:35.465 region:rollup2
LASTING ONLY SO LONG AS IT WOULD

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:36.599 region:rollup2
TAKE TO ORGANIZE A SPECIAL

01:10:35.465 --> 01:10:37.867 region:rollup2
ELECTION.

01:10:36.599 --> 01:10:39.335 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY THE VACANCY ACOSTA

01:10:37.867 --> 01:10:41.170 region:rollup2
PILATES THAT IN THE EVENT OF A

01:10:39.335 --> 01:10:43.039 region:rollup2
VACANCY. GOVERNOR'S QUOTE OF

01:10:41.170 --> 01:10:43.973 region:rollup2

01:10:43.973 --> 01:10:48.845 region:rollup2
THE BILL SUCH VACANCIES.

01:10:46.976 --> 01:10:50.246 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM ARISES WHEN

01:10:48.845 --> 01:10:52.048 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S DETERMINED TO

01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:52.949 region:rollup2
ARTIFICIALLY LENGTHEN THE TENURE

01:10:52.048 --> 01:10:54.917 region:rollup2
OF APPOINTED SENATORS OFTEN

01:10:52.949 --> 01:10:56.853 region:rollup2

OCCASIONS SINCE NINETEEN

01:10:59.555 --> 01:11:01.958 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN.

01:11:01.023 --> 01:11:03.359 region:rollup2
WHAT DO YOU WHAT SENATE VACANCY

01:11:01.958 --> 01:11:04.527 region:rollup2
HAS OCCURRED?

01:11:03.359 --> 01:11:06.129 region:rollup2
DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN

01:11:04.527 --> 01:11:07.830 region:rollup2
GOVERNORS LIKE HAVE DECLINED TO

CALL A SPECIAL ELECTION.

01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:10.733 region:rollup2
IFILL THE U. S. SENATE VACANCY

NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR STOCK TO

THIRTY STATUTORY AUTHORITY.

01:11:12.201 --> 01:11:16.038 region:rollup2
TO DO SO.

01:11:14.403 --> 01:11:17.273 region:rollup2
THE RESULT IS THAT APPOINTMENTS

01:11:16.038 --> 01:11:18.941 region:rollup2
TO THE U. S. SENATE CAN LAST UP

01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:20.743 region:rollup2
TO TWO AND A HALF YEARS AND

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:23.379 region:rollup2
IMPORTANTLY. THE APPOINTED

THE ADVANTAGE OF INCUMBENCY

BY APPOINTMENT.

01:11:29.886 --> 01:11:32.388 region:rollup2
THIS POSES CHALLENGES TO THE

01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:33.723 region:rollup2
DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES OF OUR

01:11:32.388 --> 01:11:34.857 region:rollup2

ARE VERY CLOSE TO.

01:11:56.646 --> 01:11:59.615 region:rollup2
SO I THOSE EXPLAINING AND THIS

01:11:58.214 --> 01:12:02.151 region:rollup2
POSES CHALLENGES TO DEMOCRATIC

01:11:59.615 --> 01:12:02.852 region:rollup2
PRINCIPLES OF ACCOUNTABILITY.

WAS DESIGNED TO RESULT.

01:12:08.291 --> 01:12:10.893 region:rollup2
I AM AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN

01:12:09.559 --> 01:12:12.595 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE ARGUMENTS

01:12:10.893 --> 01:12:14.197 region:rollup2
THAT WERE MADE BY AGAINST

01:12:12.595 --> 01:12:14.897 region:rollup2
POLITICAL APPOINTMENTS BY THOSE

01:12:14.197 --> 01:12:16.599 region:rollup2
WHO WERE IN FAVOR OF THE

01:12:14.897 --> 01:12:17.266 region:rollup2
SEVENTEENTH AMENDMENT. I IN THE

DAY I SYSTEM BY APPOINTMENT MORE

01:12:19.702 --> 01:12:22.238 region:rollup2
OFTEN THAN NOT HAD ALLOWED

01:12:20.903 --> 01:12:24.507 region:rollup2
SENATE SEATS TO BE QUOTE

01:12:22.238 --> 01:12:25.141 region:rollup2
INDIRECTLY BOUGHT BY

01:12:24.507 --> 01:12:27.009 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTION TO PARTY FUNDS AND

01:12:25.141 --> 01:12:29.111 region:rollup2
OTHER OUTLAYS MORALLY CORRUPT.

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:30.479 region:rollup2
WE CAN SEE MOST FAMOUSLY IN THE

01:12:29.111 --> 01:12:31.380 region:rollup2
CASE OF ROBERT BOY* EFFORTS

01:12:30.479 --> 01:12:33.516 region:rollup2
TO APPOINT A SUCCESSOR TO FORMER

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:34.750 region:rollup2
US SENATOR BARACK OBAMA. THAT

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:36.018 region:rollup2
THE ARGUMENT STILL APPLIES TO

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:37.119 region:rollup2
THE PLANET PRESENT I YOU MIGHT

01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:38.321 region:rollup2
RECALL WILL GO THAT'S WAS

01:12:37.119 --> 01:12:39.722 region:rollup2
RECORDED SAYING I'M MAKING A

01:12:38.321 --> 01:12:42.625 region:rollup2
SLIGHT CHANGE TO ONE WORD HERE

01:12:39.722 --> 01:12:43.192 region:rollup2
TO KEEP THINGS PGP. I'VE GOT

01:12:42.625 --> 01:12:43.759 region:rollup2
THIS THING AND IT'S FREAKING

01:12:43.192 --> 01:12:45.428 region:rollup2
GOLD.

01:12:43.759 --> 01:12:47.363 region:rollup2
OTHER EXAMPLES OF NEPOTISM OR

01:12:45.428 --> 01:12:48.831 region:rollup2
WORSE ABOUND REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR

01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:49.899 region:rollup2
FRANK MAKOWSKI IN ALASKA OF

01:12:48.831 --> 01:12:51.234 region:rollup2
COURSE APPOINTED HIS OWN

01:12:49.899 --> 01:12:53.502 region:rollup2
DAUGHTER TO THE U. S. SENATE.

01:12:51.234 --> 01:12:54.103 region:rollup2
TWO SENATORS WHERE THE SPOUSES

01:12:53.502 --> 01:12:55.471 region:rollup2
OF THE GOVERNOR WHO APPOINTED

01:12:54.103 --> 01:12:57.373 region:rollup2
THEM.

01:12:55.471 --> 01:12:58.541 region:rollup2
IN NINE INSTANCES GOVERNORS HAVE

01:12:57.373 --> 01:12:58.808 region:rollup2
BUILT A VACANT SENATE SEAT BY

01:12:58.541 --> 01:13:01.410 region:rollup2
POINTING.

01:12:58.808 --> 01:13:03.012 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES.

01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:05.114 region:rollup2
BUT EVEN SHORT OF CORRUPTION OR

01:13:03.012 --> 01:13:06.415 region:rollup2
NEPOTISM IT IS STILL THE CASE

01:13:05.114 --> 01:13:06.983 region:rollup2
THAT GUBERNATORIAL APPOINTMENTS

01:13:06.415 --> 01:13:08.417 region:rollup2
TEND TO VIOLATE THE POPULAR

01:13:06.983 --> 01:13:10.086 region:rollup2
WELL.

01:13:08.417 --> 01:13:11.621 region:rollup2
U. S. SENATORS ARE IN MANY WAYS

01:13:10.086 --> 01:13:12.521 region:rollup2
OUR STATE AMBASSADORS OF THE

01:13:11.621 --> 01:13:13.623 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE ONLY GET

01:13:12.521 --> 01:13:15.224 region:rollup2
TWO OF THEM THERE ARE NO TERM

01:13:13.623 --> 01:13:16.459 region:rollup2
LIMITS THEIR INFLUENCE ON THE

01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:18.194 region:rollup2
AFFAIRS OF OUR STATE AND THE

01:13:16.459 --> 01:13:19.895 region:rollup2
COUNTRY CAN BE PROFOUND. AND

01:13:18.194 --> 01:13:21.964 region:rollup2
VOTERS DO NOT NECESSARILY SEEK

01:13:19.895 --> 01:13:23.065 region:rollup2
THE SAME QUALITIES IN A SENATOR

01:13:21.964 --> 01:13:24.533 region:rollup2
BUT THEY DO IN THE GOVERNOR.

01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:26.602 region:rollup2
TODAY WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:13:24.533 --> 01:13:27.803 region:rollup2
CORRECT THESE DEFICIENCIES.

01:13:26.602 --> 01:13:28.871 region:rollup2
VACANCIES IN THE SENATE AS I'VE

01:13:27.803 --> 01:13:30.973 region:rollup2
EXPLAINED ARE RELATIVELY RARE

01:13:28.871 --> 01:13:31.540 region:rollup2
HAPPENING ON AVERAGE ONLY ONCE

01:13:30.973 --> 01:13:32.675 region:rollup2
EVERY TWENTY FIVE YEARS PER

01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:33.476 region:rollup2
STATE.

01:13:32.675 --> 01:13:34.910 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN THOSE VACANCIES DO

01:13:33.476 --> 01:13:35.278 region:rollup2
OCCUR IT'S IMPORTANT THAT OUR

01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:36.979 region:rollup2
CITIZENS ARE NOT

01:13:35.278 --> 01:13:38.714 region:rollup2
DISENFRANCHISED.

01:13:36.979 --> 01:13:40.917 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND OUT

01:13:38.714 --> 01:13:42.551 region:rollup2
WITH ME TODAY ON BEHALF OF CAL

01:13:40.917 --> 01:13:45.621 region:rollup2
ABOUT CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE IS

01:13:42.551 --> 01:13:46.188 region:rollup2
JAKE LOCKER.

01:13:45.621 --> 01:13:47.356 region:rollup2
A GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS

01:13:46.188 --> 01:13:49.692 region:rollup2
MORNING.

01:13:47.356 --> 01:13:51.160 region:rollup2
I SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB TWENTY

01:13:49.692 --> 01:13:52.328 region:rollup2
FIVE TWELVE WHICH PROTECTS

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.996 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS SEVENTEENTH

AMENDMENT RIGHT TO DIRECTLY

01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:56.232 region:rollup2
ELECT THEIR UNITED STATES

01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:57.867 region:rollup2
SENATORS.

01:13:56.232 --> 01:13:59.468 region:rollup2
WE A COMMON CAUSE BELIEVE THAT

01:13:57.867 --> 01:14:00.703 region:rollup2
FILLING THE SENATE VACANCY.

01:13:59.468 --> 01:14:02.505 region:rollup2
DECISION FAR TOO IMPORTANT TO

01:14:00.703 --> 01:14:04.240 region:rollup2
LEAVE TO ONE PERSON.

01:14:02.505 --> 01:14:05.341 region:rollup2
A US SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA IS

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:06.876 region:rollup2
ONE OF MOST POWERFUL AND

01:14:05.341 --> 01:14:08.210 region:rollup2
INFLUENTIAL OFFICIALS IN THE

01:14:06.876 --> 01:14:10.379 region:rollup2
COUNTRY. REPRESENTING NEARLY

01:14:08.210 --> 01:14:11.580 region:rollup2
FORTY MILLION PEOPLE.

01:14:10.379 --> 01:14:13.382 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:14.250 region:rollup2
WAIT UP TO TWO YEARS TO CHOOSE

01:14:13.382 --> 01:14:14.850 region:rollup2
WHO WILL BE THEIR STATEWIDE

01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:16.752 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATIVE ON THE NATIONAL

01:14:14.850 --> 01:14:18.554 region:rollup2
STAGE.

01:14:16.752 --> 01:14:19.088 region:rollup2
WELL AN APPOINTMENT IS CHEAPER

01:14:18.554 --> 01:14:19.855 region:rollup2
AND FASTER THAN A SPECIAL

01:14:19.088 --> 01:14:21.223 region:rollup2
ELECTION

01:14:19.855 --> 01:14:22.925 region:rollup2
A SPECIAL ELECTION IS INHERENTLY

01:14:21.223 --> 01:14:24.226 region:rollup2
MORE DEMOCRATIC.

01:14:22.925 --> 01:14:25.161 region:rollup2
APPOINTMENTS ARE EFFECTIVELY

01:14:24.226 --> 01:14:26.929 region:rollup2
ELECTIONS DECIDED BY AN

01:14:25.161 --> 01:14:28.097 region:rollup2
ELECTORATE OF ONE.

01:14:26.929 --> 01:14:29.532 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S NO CHECKER

01:14:28.097 --> 01:14:30.733 region:rollup2
SAFEGUARDING THE CURRENT PROCESS

01:14:29.532 --> 01:14:31.901 region:rollup2
AGAINST THE GOVERNOR APPOINTING

01:14:30.733 --> 01:14:33.703 region:rollup2
A SENATOR WHO IS ON

01:14:31.901 --> 01:14:35.338 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATIVE STATE.

01:14:33.703 --> 01:14:36.972 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY AND APPOINTED

01:14:35.338 --> 01:14:38.240 region:rollup2
SENATOR WOULD RECEIVE A MAJOR

01:14:36.972 --> 01:14:39.875 region:rollup2
UNEARNED INCUMBENCY ADVANTAGE

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:41.043 region:rollup2
TOWARDS RETAINING THEIR SEATS.

01:14:39.875 --> 01:14:42.411 region:rollup2
AN APPOINTEE WOULD HAVE UP TO

01:14:41.043 --> 01:14:44.714 region:rollup2
TWO YEARS TO BUILD UP NAME

01:14:42.411 --> 01:14:45.681 region:rollup2
RECOGNITION. GARNER ENDORSEMENTS

01:14:44.714 --> 01:14:47.249 region:rollup2
AND SOLICIT CAMPAIGN

01:14:45.681 --> 01:14:48.384 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTIONS FROM A POSITION OF

01:14:47.249 --> 01:14:49.952 region:rollup2
POWER BEFORE EVER RECEIVING

01:14:48.384 --> 01:14:51.287 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

01:14:49.952 --> 01:14:52.888 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE HUGE ADVANTAGE THAT

01:14:51.287 --> 01:14:54.457 region:rollup2
INCUMBENTS RECEIVE IN ELECTIONS.

01:14:52.888 --> 01:14:56.359 region:rollup2
AND IT SENATORS OFTEN SERVE FOR

01:14:54.457 --> 01:14:57.960 region:rollup2
DECADES ON AND. THE INFLUENCE OF

01:14:56.359 --> 01:15:00.229 region:rollup2
A SENATORIAL APPOINTMENT COULD

01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:02.598 region:rollup2
LINGER FAR BEYOND THE NEXT

01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:04.233 region:rollup2
REGULARLY SCHEDULED ELECTION.

01:15:02.598 --> 01:15:05.101 region:rollup2
FINALLY S. B. TWENTY FIVE TWELVE

01:15:04.233 --> 01:15:07.336 region:rollup2
WILL LIKELY HAVE A BENEFICIAL

01:15:05.101 --> 01:15:08.304 region:rollup2
DETERRENT EFFECT.

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:09.972 region:rollup2
SENATORS CONCURRENTLY TIME THEIR

01:15:08.304 --> 01:15:11.841 region:rollup2
RESIGNATION RETIREMENT SO THEY

01:15:09.972 --> 01:15:13.442 region:rollup2
COULD HOLD SOME SWAY OVER WHO

01:15:11.841 --> 01:15:14.543 region:rollup2
WAS CHOSEN AS THEIR SUCCESSOR.

01:15:13.442 --> 01:15:16.379 region:rollup2
OR AT LEAST OVER WHICH GOVERNOR

01:15:14.543 --> 01:15:18.047 region:rollup2
CHOOSES THEIR REPLACEMENT.

01:15:16.379 --> 01:15:19.715 region:rollup2
UNDER AB TWENTY FIVE TWELVE

THE INSTANCES OF NEPOTISM MORE

01:15:51.914 --> 01:15:55.618 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF OF THESE ISSUES. UP

01:15:54.183 --> 01:15:56.185 region:rollup2

QUITE A BIT FROM IT AND THAT

01:16:57.646 --> 01:17:00.182 region:rollup2

POINTS RAISED AYE IN IT AS WELL

01:17:00.182 --> 01:17:02.885 region:rollup2

RAISED ARE AT SOMEWHAT

01:17:02.885 --> 01:17:05.855 region:rollup2
LOGISTICAL NATURE.

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:07.323 region:rollup2

EXAMPLE SO I AM I JUST AFTER THE

01:17:09.158 --> 01:17:11.360 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION TODAY

01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:12.761 region:rollup2
IN ENDORSING THE PRINCIPLE THAT

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:14.230 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHOOSE. OUR

01:17:12.761 --> 01:17:16.665 region:rollup2

THESE WILL JUST WHAT'S

01:17:19.001 --> 01:17:23.139 region:rollup2
LOGISTICAL ASPECTS GOING FORWARD

01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:23.672 region:rollup2

AS HE ANNOUNCES POINTS OUT.

01:17:25.841 --> 01:17:27.109 region:rollup2
.

01:17:26.542 --> 01:17:28.177 region:rollup2
MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS IS A

01:17:27.109 --> 01:17:29.979 region:rollup2
SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM

01:17:28.177 --> 01:17:32.181 region:rollup2
THAT CREATES MORE PROBLEMS.

01:17:29.979 --> 01:17:33.782 region:rollup2
AND THE REASON I SAY THAT IS A

01:17:32.181 --> 01:17:34.517 region:rollup2
TWO FOLD ONE IS HEARING

01:17:33.782 --> 01:17:36.218 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WE GOT FIVE

01:17:34.517 --> 01:17:37.786 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS

01:17:36.218 --> 01:17:39.488 region:rollup2
A OF GOVERNOR GUBERNATORIAL

01:17:37.786 --> 01:17:40.990 region:rollup2
APPOINTMENTS AND AND ONLY IN.

01:17:39.488 --> 01:17:43.092 region:rollup2
FORTY PERCENT OF THOSE IN INTO

01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:44.226 region:rollup2
ARE THE FIVE HAS THE APPOINTED

01:17:43.092 --> 01:17:45.895 region:rollup2
SENATOR.

01:17:44.226 --> 01:17:47.429 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFULLY RUN FOR REELECTION.

01:17:45.895 --> 01:17:49.565 region:rollup2
IN ONE OF THE FIVE CASES THAT

01:17:47.429 --> 01:17:51.033 region:rollup2
CHOSE NOT TO RUN INTO THE FIVE

01:17:49.565 --> 01:17:52.835 region:rollup2
THEY RAN IN THE SUBSEQUENT

01:17:51.033 --> 01:17:54.470 region:rollup2
ELECTION LOST SO VOTERS DID HAVE

01:17:52.835 --> 01:17:55.404 region:rollup2
A CHANCE TO WEIGH IN.

01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:57.873 region:rollup2
AND THE VOTERS WAITED AND THEN

01:17:55.404 --> 01:17:58.340 region:rollup2
AND DECIDED THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

01:17:57.873 --> 01:18:00.276 region:rollup2
APPOINTEE WAS NOT THE

01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:01.777 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE PERSON.

01:18:00.276 --> 01:18:03.579 region:rollup2
I'D NATIONWIDE.

01:18:01.777 --> 01:18:05.614 region:rollup2
SINCE NINETEEN THIRTEEN.

01:18:03.579 --> 01:18:07.383 region:rollup2
ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN SENATORS

01:18:05.614 --> 01:18:08.884 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN APPOINTED BY THIS

01:18:07.383 --> 01:18:11.387 region:rollup2
PRIOR TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHO

01:18:08.884 --> 01:18:13.155 region:rollup2
SUBSEQUENTLY SOUGHT A ELECTION

01:18:11.387 --> 01:18:13.989 region:rollup2
AND OUT OF THAT FIFTY TWO AND A

01:18:13.155 --> 01:18:15.591 region:rollup2
HALF PERCENT WHO PURSUED

01:18:13.989 --> 01:18:17.226 region:rollup2
ELECTION WERE SUCCESSFUL. AND

01:18:15.591 --> 01:18:17.893 region:rollup2
FORTY SEVEN AND A HALF PERCENT

01:18:17.226 --> 01:18:19.929 region:rollup2
WERE DEFEATED SO IT'S KIND OF A

01:18:17.893 --> 01:18:21.297 region:rollup2
COIN FLIP A IN TERMS OF WHETHER

01:18:19.929 --> 01:18:23.365 region:rollup2
OR NOT THE VOTERS.

01:18:21.297 --> 01:18:24.733 region:rollup2
GONNA VALIDATE THE GOVERNOR BIG

01:18:23.365 --> 01:18:26.235 region:rollup2
GUBERNATORIAL APPOINTMENT BUT

01:18:24.733 --> 01:18:27.736 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT CREATES

01:18:26.235 --> 01:18:29.438 region:rollup2
ARE ARE NUMEROUS AND I THINK

01:18:27.736 --> 01:18:30.306 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT.

01:18:29.438 --> 01:18:31.540 region:rollup2
ONE IS COST.

01:18:30.306 --> 01:18:34.143 region:rollup2
AND A SPECIAL STATEWIDE

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:35.578 region:rollup2
ELECTION FOR FOR U. S. SENATE

01:18:34.143 --> 01:18:36.745 region:rollup2
WILL COST A TOTAL OF TWO IT UP

01:18:35.578 --> 01:18:38.347 region:rollup2
TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A

01:18:36.745 --> 01:18:38.881 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE PRIMARY.

01:18:38.347 --> 01:18:41.283 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE

01:18:38.881 --> 01:18:42.618 region:rollup2
GENERAL OF THE MORE IMPORTANTLY

01:18:41.283 --> 01:18:44.220 region:rollup2
THAN THAT THAT STATE OF

01:18:42.618 --> 01:18:45.387 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND ARE ALMOST FORTY

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:48.090 region:rollup2
MILLION PEOPLE.

01:18:45.387 --> 01:18:49.758 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE TO BE ABSENT OF A

01:18:48.090 --> 01:18:52.494 region:rollup2
VOICE OF A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

01:18:49.758 --> 01:18:54.496 region:rollup2
VOICE IN IT BODY WORK CALIFORNIA

01:18:52.494 --> 01:18:55.731 region:rollup2
IS ALREADY UP UNDERREPRESENTED

01:18:54.496 --> 01:18:55.965 region:rollup2
BASED ON OUR POPULATION AND WE.

01:18:55.731 --> 01:18:57.199 region:rollup2
COULD.

01:18:55.965 --> 01:18:58.167 region:rollup2
WE WOULD ONLY HAVE ONE

01:18:57.199 --> 01:18:58.934 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATIVE IN THE U. S.

01:18:58.167 --> 01:19:00.235 region:rollup2
SENATE.

01:18:58.934 --> 01:19:02.271 region:rollup2
WHICH CAN BE CRITICAL AS WE'VE

01:19:00.235 --> 01:19:03.539 region:rollup2
SEEN TO A LOT OF LEGISLATION AT

01:19:02.271 --> 01:19:04.340 region:rollup2
ARGUE TERRIBLE LEGISLATION

01:19:03.539 --> 01:19:05.808 region:rollup2
GETTING PAST.

01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:07.409 region:rollup2
IN THE U. S. SENATE.

01:19:05.808 --> 01:19:09.144 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO THAT.

01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:11.513 region:rollup2
.

01:19:09.144 --> 01:19:13.215 region:rollup2
IN A BIGGER CONCERN IS THAT IF

01:19:11.513 --> 01:19:14.550 region:rollup2
WE WERE TO MAKE THIS CHANGE IT

01:19:13.215 --> 01:19:15.918 region:rollup2
WILL CREATE A SYSTEM WHERE ONLY

01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:17.486 region:rollup2
WEALTHY PEOPLE WOULD EVEN HAVE A

01:19:15.918 --> 01:19:19.121 region:rollup2
CHANCE OF WINNING.

01:19:17.486 --> 01:19:20.990 region:rollup2
BECAUSE BY HAVING A SPECIAL

01:19:19.121 --> 01:19:22.825 region:rollup2
ELECTION FOR U. S. SENATE.

01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:25.194 region:rollup2

SO MANY PEOPLE SO QUICKLY AND SO

01:19:36.372 --> 01:19:39.541 region:rollup2
THAT MEANS THAT THAT.

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:41.143 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT

01:19:39.541 --> 01:19:41.644 region:rollup2
COULD POSSIBLY WIN ARE PEOPLE

01:19:41.644 --> 01:19:43.879 region:rollup2
CAMPAIGNS.

GOVERNMENT ETHICS LAWS.

01:21:34.590 --> 01:21:37.192 region:rollup2
THE F. BBC ENFORCES THE

01:21:35.758 --> 01:21:38.894 region:rollup2
POLITICAL REFORM ACT WHICH IS

01:21:37.192 --> 01:21:39.828 region:rollup2
THE MAIN LAW THE GOVERNOR STATE

01:21:43.432 --> 01:21:46.668 region:rollup2
AGAINST THOSE WHO VIOLATE THE

IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN.

01:21:55.077 --> 01:21:57.846 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH THE POLITICAL REFORM

01:21:56.412 --> 01:21:59.548 region:rollup2
ACT ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO

01:21:57.846 --> 01:22:01.216 region:rollup2
ADOPT THEIR OWN ORDINANCES TO

01:21:59.548 --> 01:22:02.751 region:rollup2
GOVERN CAMPAIGNS FOR LOCAL

01:22:01.216 --> 01:22:04.686 region:rollup2
PUBLIC A POLITICAL OFFICE. THE

INSTEAD THE ENFORCEMENT OF THESE

01:22:07.923 --> 01:22:11.460 region:rollup2

COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY.

01:22:13.362 --> 01:22:15.731 region:rollup2
SINCE MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:22:14.396 --> 01:22:17.733 region:rollup2
LACK THE EXPERIENCE

01:22:15.731 --> 01:22:19.635 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATING OR PROSECUTING

01:22:17.733 --> 01:22:21.637 region:rollup2
CAMPAIGN VIOLATIONS THERE IS

01:22:19.635 --> 01:22:23.038 region:rollup2

CAMPAIGN LOTS.

01:22:24.339 --> 01:22:28.010 region:rollup2
IN RECENT YEARS THE LEGISLATURE

01:22:25.874 --> 01:22:29.978 region:rollup2
HAS PASSED FOR BILLS THAT DO

01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:31.079 region:rollup2

UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT.

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:48.130 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WOULD GIVE LOCAL

GOVERNMENTS THE ABILITY TO BRING

01:22:48.130 --> 01:22:51.667 region:rollup2

SPURIOUS INDEPENDENT AND

01:22:51.667 --> 01:22:55.037 region:rollup2
IMPARTIAL ENTITY TO INVESTIGATE

BUT YOU'RE MUCH.

01:23:12.221 --> 01:23:15.123 region:rollup2
CHAIR MEMBERS A NICHOLAS ITEM

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:16.725 region:rollup2
WITH CALIFORNIA COME BECAUSE

01:23:15.123 --> 01:23:18.260 region:rollup2
VERY PROUD SPONSOR AB TWENTY

01:23:16.725 --> 01:23:19.928 region:rollup2
EIGHT EIGHTY WHICH WOULD PROVIDE

01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:21.163 region:rollup2
AN IMPORTANT FORCE AN OPTION.

01:23:19.928 --> 01:23:22.998 region:rollup2
FOR LOCAL CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND

01:23:21.163 --> 01:23:24.299 region:rollup2
ETHICS ORDINANCES NO COST TO THE

01:23:22.998 --> 01:23:25.334 region:rollup2
STATE.

01:23:24.299 --> 01:23:26.602 region:rollup2
UNDER CURRENT LAW OTHER THAN

01:23:25.334 --> 01:23:28.203 region:rollup2
DISCLOSURE RULES THERE NO

01:23:26.602 --> 01:23:30.172 region:rollup2
CAMPAIGN FINANCE LIMITS AT THE

01:23:28.203 --> 01:23:31.273 region:rollup2
LOCAL LEVEL HOWEVER LOCAL

01:23:30.172 --> 01:23:32.608 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS DO HAVE THE ABILITY

01:23:31.273 --> 01:23:34.476 region:rollup2
TO ENACT THEIR OWN CAMPAIGN

01:23:32.608 --> 01:23:35.777 region:rollup2
FINANCE ORDINANCES. FOR MANY DO

01:23:34.476 --> 01:23:37.379 region:rollup2
SO IN FACT WELL OVER HUNDRED

01:23:35.777 --> 01:23:39.147 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS HAVE ENACTED LOCAL

01:23:37.379 --> 01:23:40.449 region:rollup2
ORDINANCES WHICH WE THINK IS A

01:23:39.147 --> 01:23:41.984 region:rollup2
VERY GOOD THING.

01:23:40.449 --> 01:23:44.319 region:rollup2
FOR LARGE JURISDICTIONS LIKE LOS

01:23:41.984 --> 01:23:45.287 region:rollup2
ANGELES SAN DIEGO ORANGE COUNTY

01:23:44.319 --> 01:23:47.155 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHING AN ETHICS

01:23:45.287 --> 01:23:48.757 region:rollup2
COMMISSION IS AN EFFECTIVE AND

01:23:47.155 --> 01:23:49.224 region:rollup2
FEASIBLE MEANS FOR DOING

01:23:48.757 --> 01:23:50.158 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT FOR THESE

01:23:49.224 --> 01:23:52.461 region:rollup2
ORDINANCES.

01:23:50.158 --> 01:23:53.495 region:rollup2
BUT AS THE AUTHORS MENTION FOR

01:23:52.461 --> 01:23:54.796 region:rollup2
MANY OTHER JURISDICTIONS

01:23:53.495 --> 01:23:56.398 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY SMALLER AND MID

01:23:54.796 --> 01:23:58.133 region:rollup2
SIZE JURISDICTIONS IT CAN BE

01:23:56.398 --> 01:23:59.301 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO AFFORD ESTABLISHING

01:23:58.133 --> 01:24:00.802 region:rollup2
AN ETHICS COMMISSION.

01:23:59.301 --> 01:24:02.337 region:rollup2
AS A CONSEQUENCE IT GENERALLY

01:24:00.802 --> 01:24:04.039 region:rollup2
RELY ON THE CITY ATTORNEY OR

01:24:02.337 --> 01:24:06.475 region:rollup2
DISK TURNING FOR ENFORCEMENT.

01:24:04.039 --> 01:24:08.210 region:rollup2
BUT AS A RESULT UNFORTUNATELY

01:24:06.475 --> 01:24:10.379 region:rollup2
LOCAL FORCE INTENSITY RARE. AS

01:24:08.210 --> 01:24:11.013 region:rollup2
THE OTHER MENTION MANY CASES

01:24:10.379 --> 01:24:12.781 region:rollup2
LOCAL CITY ATTORNEYS ARE DA'S

01:24:11.013 --> 01:24:14.816 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE EXPERIENCE IN FORCING

01:24:12.781 --> 01:24:15.984 region:rollup2
CAMPAIGN FINANCE RULES. MOREOVER

01:24:14.816 --> 01:24:17.653 region:rollup2
THEY OFTEN OF OTHER PRIORITIES

01:24:15.984 --> 01:24:19.121 region:rollup2
SO FOR EXAMPLE DISTRICT ATTORNEY

01:24:17.653 --> 01:24:20.589 region:rollup2
WHEN DECIDING HOW TO PRIORITIZE

01:24:19.121 --> 01:24:21.490 region:rollup2
OUR RESOURCES MORE LIKELY TO

01:24:20.589 --> 01:24:22.391 region:rollup2
PROSECUTE VIOLENT CRIME

01:24:21.490 --> 01:24:24.459 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THAN A CAMPAIGN

01:24:22.391 --> 01:24:24.927 region:rollup2
FINANCE VIOLATION WHICH MAKES

01:24:24.459 --> 01:24:26.428 region:rollup2
SENSE.

01:24:24.927 --> 01:24:27.763 region:rollup2
FINALLY THERE'S ALSO RISK OF THE

01:24:26.428 --> 01:24:29.064 region:rollup2
APPEARANCE OF POLITICAL BIAS

01:24:27.763 --> 01:24:30.532 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU HAVE A CITY ATTORNEY

01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:32.401 region:rollup2
WHO'S APPOINTED BY INCUMBENTS ON

01:24:30.532 --> 01:24:33.902 region:rollup2
THE CITY COUNCIL OR ELECTED

01:24:32.401 --> 01:24:35.637 region:rollup2
DISTRICT ATTORNEY. I'D DOING

01:24:33.902 --> 01:24:37.172 region:rollup2
PROSECUTIONS WITHIN A POLITICAL

01:24:35.637 --> 01:24:38.640 region:rollup2
RACE.

01:24:37.172 --> 01:24:39.908 region:rollup2
I AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY FOR ALL

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:40.976 region:rollup2
THESE REASONS WOULD ALLOW LOCAL

01:24:39.908 --> 01:24:42.811 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS BY MUTUAL

01:24:40.976 --> 01:24:44.446 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT ACCORDINGLY CONTRACT

01:24:42.811 --> 01:24:45.213 region:rollup2
VIA PPC FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF

01:24:44.446 --> 01:24:47.249 region:rollup2
LOCAL ORDINANCE.

01:24:45.213 --> 01:24:49.017 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF PPC SPECIALIZES IN

01:24:47.249 --> 01:24:50.953 region:rollup2
CAMPAIGN ENFORCEMENT AND USES AN

01:24:49.017 --> 01:24:51.753 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS WE

01:24:50.953 --> 01:24:52.654 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THIS WILL STREAMLINING

01:24:51.753 --> 01:24:54.590 region:rollup2
CRATE FOR MORE COST EFFECTIVE

01:24:52.654 --> 01:24:56.391 region:rollup2
LOCAL ENFORCEMENT. AT A FRACTION

01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:57.426 region:rollup2
OF THE COST OF SETTING UP AN

01:24:56.391 --> 01:24:59.227 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT ETHICS COMMISSION.

01:24:57.426 --> 01:25:00.762 region:rollup2
MOREOVER THE EFFICACY IS HIGHLY

01:24:59.227 --> 01:25:01.930 region:rollup2
RESPECTED AS AN IMPARTIAL BODY

01:25:00.762 --> 01:25:04.232 region:rollup2
MAKING FOR SOME LESS

01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:05.033 region:rollup2
CONTROVERSIAL LOCALLY.

01:25:04.232 --> 01:25:06.201 region:rollup2
FINALLY BECAUSE IT REPORT CARMEN

01:25:05.033 --> 01:25:08.103 region:rollup2
PARTS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PAY

01:25:06.201 --> 01:25:10.138 region:rollup2
FOR THE SERVICE THERE SHOULD BE

01:25:08.103 --> 01:25:11.373 region:rollup2
NO COST OF STATE.

01:25:10.138 --> 01:25:12.407 region:rollup2
I AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY AS WAS

01:25:11.373 --> 01:25:14.009 region:rollup2
MENTIONED IS EXPANDING A

01:25:12.407 --> 01:25:14.843 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL BIPARTISAN MODEL A

01:25:14.009 --> 01:25:15.811 region:rollup2
WHICH IS ALREADY BEEN

01:25:14.843 --> 01:25:17.346 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED IN THREE CITIES

01:25:15.811 --> 01:25:24.886 region:rollup2
INCLUDING SACRAMENTO STOCKTON

01:25:17.346 --> 01:25:26.355 region:rollup2
SAN AND BURNED YOU KNOW COUNTY

01:25:24.886 --> 01:25:28.490 region:rollup2
MODEL. SAVE BEEN HIGHLY

01:25:26.355 --> 01:25:30.559 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL LEADING TO MORE

01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:33.929 region:rollup2
EDUCATION OF CANDIDATES ON LOCAL

01:25:30.559 --> 01:25:34.529 region:rollup2
ORDINANCE REQUIREMENTS THOSE

01:25:33.929 --> 01:25:36.832 region:rollup2
MORE ENFORCEMENT AND HAD BEEN

01:25:34.529 --> 01:25:38.033 region:rollup2
THE CASE.

01:25:36.832 --> 01:25:39.267 region:rollup2
SO TO CONCLUDE AB TWENTY EIGHT

01:25:38.033 --> 01:25:40.068 region:rollup2
EIGHTY PROVIDES IMPORTANT

01:25:39.267 --> 01:25:41.770 region:rollup2
ENFORCE AN OPTION IT'S ANOTHER

01:25:40.068 --> 01:25:42.704 region:rollup2
TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX TO MAKE

01:25:41.770 --> 01:25:46.341 region:rollup2
LOCAL CAMPAIGN FINANCE

01:25:42.704 --> 01:25:47.843 region:rollup2
ORDINANCES MORE EFFECTIVE. AND

01:25:46.341 --> 01:25:49.411 region:rollup2
MORE FROM AYE EASILY ENFORCED.

01:25:47.843 --> 01:25:50.779 region:rollup2
FINALLY AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY

01:25:49.411 --> 01:25:52.180 region:rollup2
ALSO LIMITS IN THE FOR FUTURE

01:25:50.779 --> 01:25:52.881 region:rollup2
SPECIAL LEGISLATION BY OPENING

01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:54.116 region:rollup2
THE SOLE AUTHORITY TO OTHER

01:25:52.881 --> 01:25:56.752 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS.

01:25:54.116 --> 01:25:58.987 region:rollup2
A RELYING ON SPECIALIZATION CAN

01:25:56.752 --> 01:26:01.623 region:rollup2
DELAY BY MORE THAN A YEAR THE

01:25:58.987 --> 01:26:03.992 region:rollup2
ABILITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:26:01.623 --> 01:26:04.593 region:rollup2
TENSIONS OF THIS CONTRACT WHICH

01:26:03.992 --> 01:26:07.629 region:rollup2
REVIEWS A HUGE BENEFIT TO THIS

01:26:04.593 --> 01:26:09.364 region:rollup2
BILL.

01:26:07.629 --> 01:26:12.067 region:rollup2
SEVERAL THESE REASONS WERE VERY

01:26:09.364 --> 01:26:14.469 region:rollup2
PROUD SPONSOR THIS BILL AND URGE

01:26:12.067 --> 01:26:16.605 region:rollup2
KNIFE.

STATED THAT THIS BILL IS

01:47:37.351 --> 01:47:40.921 region:rollup2
UNNECESSARY.

01:47:38.719 --> 01:47:43.090 region:rollup2

WHY THE BALLOT WAS NOT COUNTD.

01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:55.803 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS

01:47:54.635 --> 01:47:56.971 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT.

01:48:05.679 --> 01:48:09.450 region:rollup2

INTIMATELY FAMILIAR WITH WITH

01:48:13.153 --> 01:48:18.158 region:rollup2
THE PRIOR BILL THAT WAS VETOED.

01:48:14.722 --> 01:48:20.527 region:rollup2
BUT THIS IT COULD CREATE EATEN

01:48:18.158 --> 01:48:22.496 region:rollup2
UTILIZES TECHNOLOGY TO EASILY

01:48:20.527 --> 01:48:23.964 region:rollup2
PUT OUT INFORMATION TO VOTERS TO

01:48:22.496 --> 01:48:24.965 region:rollup2

ALONG IN THE PROCESS.

01:48:26.667 --> 01:48:29.136 region:rollup2
SO.

01:48:27.401 --> 01:48:30.537 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING

01:48:29.136 --> 01:48:32.873 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEEN TRIED IN DENVER.

01:48:30.537 --> 01:48:34.274 region:rollup2

01:48:32.873 --> 01:48:35.943 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL AND.
