01:32:17.398 --> 01:32:18.466
ISSUE IS THAT WE'RE NOW GOING

01:32:18.532 --> 01:32:19.500
TO SAY THAT THERE'S GONNA BE

01:32:19.567 --> 01:32:22.670
15% AFFORDABLE COMPONENT. NOW I

01:32:22.737 --> 01:32:23.437
WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE

01:32:23.504 --> 01:32:24.205

SO WE ALSO RESPECT THE

01:32:37.018 --> 01:32:39.086
INCLUSIONARY HOUSING ORDINANCE

01:32:39.153 --> 01:32:40.388
AMENDMENT THAT WAS PROVIDED BY

GERMAN FRIEDMAN IN INDIA IT

01:32:42.056 --> 01:32:43.224
REALLY MAKES SENSE TO ALLOW

01:32:43.291 --> 01:32:44.191
THAT FOR THAT LOCAL CONTROL

01:32:44.258 --> 01:32:46.093
ESPECIALLY. IF IT'S A STRONGER

01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:49.230
PROVISION- ABOVE AND BEYOND THE

01:32:49.297 --> 01:32:51.499
15% BUT WHAT WOULD TO. PREVENT

01:32:51.565 --> 01:32:54.535

QUALIFY A 5% OF THE HOUSING IS

01:33:04.078 --> 01:33:06.213
DEVOTED TO IT MEETS THE

INCLUSIONARY HOUSING

01:33:09.684 --> 01:33:11.552
REQUIREMENT WOULD BE THAT

01:33:11.619 --> 01:33:12.787
THAT'S JUST GONNA BE BASED ON

01:33:12.853 --> 01:33:15.389
WHATEVER THE LOCAL HATS- SO

01:33:15.456 --> 01:33:17.024
THAT'S THAT'S STRICTLY BASED

01:33:17.091 --> 01:33:18.993
OFF OF LOCAL SO IF THERE IS IN

01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:20.494

WITHIN THIS BILL NOW. WE'VE

01:33:25.499 --> 01:33:28.269
CREATED A SECOND CATEGORY SO

01:33:28.336 --> 01:33:29.870
FIRST AND FOREMOST WE HAVE THE

01:33:29.937 --> 01:33:30.938
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR CATEGORY

01:33:31.005 --> 01:33:32.506
FOR THOSE LARGE- PROJECTS LIKE

01:33:32.573 --> 01:33:35.843
WE SEEN WITH. STADIUMS SO-

01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:37.411
UNDER THESE PROJECTS WHAT WE'VE

01:33:37.478 --> 01:33:39.547
SEEN IS THAT THERE BEEN TEN

01:33:39.613 --> 01:33:41.849
THOUSAND HOUSING UNITS SINCE AB

01:33:41.916 --> 01:33:43.818

APPROVED OR GETTING BUILT NOW

01:33:47.788 --> 01:33:48.422
IN THOSE THREE CATEGORIES

01:33:48.489 --> 01:33:52.193
NUMBER ONE- THE SECOND A NEW

01:33:52.259 --> 01:33:53.361
CATEGORY THAT WE'RE ADDING IS

01:33:53.427 --> 01:33:54.862
WE'RE ACTUALLY ADDING THE SAME

01:33:54.929 --> 01:33:56.831
JUDICIAL REVIEW SHOT CLOCK OF

01:33:56.897 --> 01:33:58.899
THAT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS.

01:33:58.966 --> 01:34:00.034
FOR HOUSING PRICE. AT MILLION

01:34:00.101 --> 01:34:03.637
DOLLARS GROSS COSTS OR MORE. IN

01:34:03.704 --> 01:34:04.839

AFFORDABLE- AND- IF THERE'S

01:34:11.245 --> 01:34:13.714
INCLUDE YOUR HOUSING- ZONING

01:34:13.781 --> 01:34:15.516

SMALL COMMUNITIES WELL. THAT

01:34:17.418 --> 01:34:19.820
WOULD BUT IF IT'S- MORE

01:34:19.887 --> 01:34:21.689
AGGRESSIVE NOW I DON'T

01:34:21.756 --> 01:34:22.256
UNDERSTAND ALL THAT BUT THAT

01:34:22.323 --> 01:34:25.226
MIGHT. MY CONCERN IS THAT- THIS

01:34:25.292 --> 01:34:27.428
CAN BE- AMENDED TOUTED AS A

01:34:27.495 --> 01:34:28.963

01:34:31.465 --> 01:34:34.969
GIANT LOOPHOLE TO. TO GET- 95%

01:34:35.036 --> 01:34:37.038
COMMERCIAL PROJECT WITH A- VERY

01:34:37.104 --> 01:34:38.773
SMALL PERCENTAGE SHOULD DEVOTE

01:34:38.839 --> 01:34:41.842
THE HOUSING- THAT'S THE THAT'S

01:34:41.909 --> 01:34:43.077
THE SB THIRTY FIVE. WILL

FOR THE CLARIFICATION. THE

01:35:02.063 --> 01:35:04.698
SECOND IS HOW. A IN TERMS OF

01:35:04.765 --> 01:35:07.902
THE 15% INCLUSIONARY- HOUSE

01:35:07.968 --> 01:35:10.671
HAVE FORMAL TO FIND. WE JUST

01:35:10.738 --> 01:35:11.872
SAY FOR HOUSING SO THAT WOULD

01:35:11.939 --> 01:35:13.174
BE WITHIN OUR THREE CATEGORIES

01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:15.209
OF MIND A MODERATE LOW AND VERY

01:35:15.276 --> 01:35:19.980
LOW. BUT WE DO NOT DISTINGUISH-

01:35:20.047 --> 01:35:22.049
WHICH CATEGORY WOULD BE THAT

01:35:22.116 --> 01:35:23.851
WOULD RECEIVE PREFERENCE WITHIN

01:35:23.918 --> 01:35:28.122
NINE NINE FIVE. SO. THE

01:35:28.189 --> 01:35:32.760
MODERATE. YEAH THE MODERATE TO

01:35:32.827 --> 01:35:36.130
INCOME- WOULD QUALIFY FOR YEAH

01:35:36.197 --> 01:35:37.465
MADRE YEAH WITHIN THOSE THREE

01:35:37.531 --> 01:35:38.466
CATEGORIES AND I THINK THAT'S

01:35:38.532 --> 01:35:39.633
THE OTHER IMPORTANT PIECE ABOUT

01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:41.202
THIS IT WOULD ALLOW SOME

01:35:41.268 --> 01:35:42.503
FLEXIBILITY FOR THOSE LOCAL

01:35:42.570 --> 01:35:44.004
GOVERNMENTS RIGHT- DEALING WITH

01:35:44.071 --> 01:35:47.274
THAT 15% TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A

01:35:47.341 --> 01:35:47.875
LOOK AT WHATEVER THEIR NUMBERS

01:35:47.942 --> 01:35:48.843
MAY BE WHERE THEY NEED SHORT

01:35:48.909 --> 01:35:52.046
AND ALLOW THEM TO BE ABLE TO-

01:35:52.113 --> 01:35:54.215
WORK THAT 15% DEPENDING ON

01:35:54.281 --> 01:35:56.117
WHERE THE GREATEST NEED IS.

01:35:56.183 --> 01:35:57.618
RELATED TO AFFORDABLE OKAY I

01:35:57.685 --> 01:35:59.687
MEAN I CAN APPRECIATE THAT BUT

01:35:59.753 --> 01:36:03.324
I THINK A- CENTER YOU YOU HAVE

01:36:03.390 --> 01:36:06.594
A- COMMUNITIES ARE SIMILAR TO

01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:08.696
MY COMMUNITIES WHERE. MY

01:36:08.762 --> 01:36:09.530
COMMUNITIES THEY'RE THEY'RE

01:36:09.597 --> 01:36:12.399
COMPLAINING THAT THE- THAT THE

01:36:12.466 --> 01:36:13.667
THAT THE STATE IS TALKING ABOUT

01:36:13.734 --> 01:36:15.736
THE- BUILDING MORE AFFORDABLE

01:36:15.803 --> 01:36:18.973
HOUSING AND ALL THEY SEE IS- A

01:36:19.039 --> 01:36:20.541
LUXURY HOUSING BEING BUILT. ON

01:36:20.608 --> 01:36:24.345
AND- YOU KNOW WHY MODERATE TO

01:36:24.411 --> 01:36:26.680
MODERATELY AFFORDABLE IS BETTER

01:36:26.747 --> 01:36:30.551
THAN LUXURY. THE CONCERN IS

01:36:30.618 --> 01:36:33.854
THAT. YOU KNOW THESE BILLS THAT

01:36:33.921 --> 01:36:35.389
ARE BEING TOUTED AS AFFORDABLE

01:36:35.456 --> 01:36:39.026
HOUSING SOLUTIONS ARE NOT. MORE

01:36:39.093 --> 01:36:42.363
DIRECTLY- AND TO A GREATER

01:36:42.429 --> 01:36:45.666
EXTENT- FOCUSING ON THE LOW AND

01:36:45.733 --> 01:36:48.435
VERY LOW INCOME- SITES I JUST

01:36:48.502 --> 01:36:49.069
WANTED TO MAKE THAT POINT

01:36:49.136 --> 01:36:52.873
THINKING WHO DOES HAVE A VERY I

01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:53.440
THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE CORRECT

01:36:53.507 --> 01:36:54.008
WITH THAT IN REGARDS TO THIS

01:36:54.074 --> 01:36:55.543
POINT IS THAT. WHEN WE TAKE A

01:36:55.609 --> 01:36:57.444
LOOK AT- ARE INCREDIBLE

01:36:57.511 --> 01:36:58.279
CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE ACROSS

01:36:58.345 --> 01:37:00.981
THE STATE- EIGHT EXISTED PRIOR

01:37:01.048 --> 01:37:03.617

REGARDS TO THE ARE AFFORDABLE

01:37:06.921 --> 01:37:08.422
HOUSING STOCK. WHAT I'LL SAY

01:37:08.489 --> 01:37:10.391
IS- THAT THERE'S A PRETTY

01:37:10.457 --> 01:37:12.293
SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN REGARD TO

01:37:12.359 --> 01:37:14.395
ADDING THAT 50% AFFORDABLE INTO

01:37:14.461 --> 01:37:17.631
THIS MIX- THIS- WE HAVE NEVER

01:37:17.698 --> 01:37:20.568
TOUTED THIS IS A 1100%

01:37:20.634 --> 01:37:22.603
AFFORDABLE HOUSING BILL BUT-

01:37:22.670 --> 01:37:24.939
THIS YOU WILL SEE HOUSING

01:37:25.005 --> 01:37:26.507
PRODUCTION AS PART OF THIS BILL

01:37:26.574 --> 01:37:30.844
I DIDN'T SEE NINE. WAS FOR.

01:37:30.911 --> 01:37:32.780
PASS IT WAS PASS BY THE STATE.

01:37:32.846 --> 01:37:34.081
APPROXIMATELY TEN TO TWO

01:37:34.148 --> 01:37:35.049
HUNDRED UNITS HAVE EITHER BEEN

01:37:35.115 --> 01:37:37.051
BUILT. PERMITTED AND OR UNDER

01:37:37.117 --> 01:37:39.253
CONSTRUCTION- AND NOW WHAT

01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:40.788
WE'RE SAYING IS WE NEED TO BE A

01:37:40.854 --> 01:37:42.823
STRENGTH IN THIS- BY ADDING IT

01:37:42.890 --> 01:37:44.825

WHAT IS IN FRONT OF TODAY IS

01:42:13.594 --> 01:42:15.629
MUCH DIFFERENT THAN WHAT AB

01:42:15.696 --> 01:42:16.997

HARD WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE- IS

01:42:21.502 --> 01:42:22.436
WELL AS THE COMMITMENT AND

01:42:22.503 --> 01:42:26.473
LEADERSHIP APPROACH. AMERICANS

01:42:31.979 --> 01:42:33.013
TO THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED

01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:36.183
ENHANCED- ENFORCEABLE STANDARDS

01:42:37.751 --> 01:42:39.786
WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL-

01:42:39.853 --> 01:42:42.589
AND WE ARE SUBJECTING HIGHER

01:42:42.656 --> 01:42:44.391

01:42:46.994 --> 01:42:48.729

BILL IT'S A COMPLICATED POLICY-

01:43:40.781 --> 01:43:43.116
AND I THINK THAT THE BILL DOES

01:43:43.183 --> 01:43:44.184
GO A LONG WAY ADDRESSING SOME

01:43:44.251 --> 01:43:46.053
OF THE LOOPHOLES AND FIXES AN

01:43:46.119 --> 01:43:47.955
OLD AB NINE HUNDRED. AND TO TRY

SURE THAT THERE IS A- BENEFIT

FOR PROJECTS THAT DEMONSTRATE

01:43:53.527 --> 01:43:55.028
REAL ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP

01:43:55.095 --> 01:43:57.230

01:43:57.297 --> 01:43:59.600
MEMONS. GOAL OF A LONG WAY AND

01:43:59.666 --> 01:44:00.834

IN TERMS OF THE GOALS THAT WE

01:44:02.336 --> 01:44:03.570
HAVE I DO THINK THAT THERE'S

01:44:03.637 --> 01:44:05.105
MORE WORK TO BE DONE WITH THE

01:44:05.172 --> 01:44:07.374
DRAFTING AND- MAKING SURE THAT.

01:44:07.441 --> 01:44:09.209
THE DETAILS ARE ARE REALLY IN

01:44:09.276 --> 01:44:12.379
THE BILL SO THAT. THEY GIVE THE

01:44:12.446 --> 01:44:13.580
OF CERTAINTY TO COMMUNITIES

01:44:13.647 --> 01:44:16.883
THAT. DEVELOPERS CAN TAKE

01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:18.852
ADVANTAGE. OF THE TRUNCATED

01:44:18.919 --> 01:44:22.089
PROCESS. TO SHORT CHANGE- WITH

01:44:22.155 --> 01:44:25.058
THE VERY LARGE PROJECTS- I

01:44:25.125 --> 01:44:28.695
REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT. WHAT I

01:44:28.762 --> 01:44:29.162
SEE IS A LITTLE BIT OF

01:44:29.229 --> 01:44:31.331
VAGUENESS WITH THE WORDS LIKE

01:44:31.398 --> 01:44:33.900
USABLE BEST EFFORTS AND I WANT

01:44:33.967 --> 01:44:35.535
TO MAKE SURE AS WE GO FORWARD.

01:44:35.602 --> 01:44:37.237
THAT THERE'S REALLY A WAY TO

01:44:37.304 --> 01:44:39.606
MAKE SURE THAT DEVELOPERS

01:44:39.673 --> 01:44:43.176
CHOOSE THAT MITIGATION FOR

01:44:43.243 --> 01:44:43.810
INSTANCE ONSITE REAL WHEN

01:44:43.877 --> 01:44:45.946
FEASIBLE. AND CONCERNED ABOUT

01:44:46.013 --> 01:44:47.547
WHO DECIDES WHAT'S FEASIBLE

01:44:47.614 --> 01:44:50.784
AND- TO THAT END I WOULD LIKE

01:44:50.851 --> 01:44:53.286
TO HAVE SOME- AGREEMENT HERE

01:44:53.353 --> 01:44:54.955
THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO GIVE

01:44:55.022 --> 01:44:57.124
INPUT AND- HAVE THAT DISCUSSION

01:44:57.190 --> 01:44:59.059
SO THAT AT THE END WE ALL FEEL

01:44:59.126 --> 01:45:01.328
COMFORTABLE. THAT WE SAFE GOING

01:45:03.764 --> 01:45:05.365

REALLY NAILING DOWN. HOW IT

01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:16.176

02:28:42.413 --> 02:28:44.282
ACCOMPLISH AND I'M WORKING VERY

02:28:44.348 --> 02:28:46.284

STATE ABOUT CALIFORNIA. AND ALL

02:28:50.288 --> 02:28:51.522
THE OFFICIAL BUT HAVE TO DEAL

02:28:51.589 --> 02:28:54.191
WITH THE SEWAGE TREATMENT. OUR

02:28:54.258 --> 02:28:55.660
SYSTEM AT THE QUANAH TO SEE

02:28:55.726 --> 02:28:57.228
WHAT ELSE THAT WE CAN DO THAT-

02:28:57.295 --> 02:29:00.164
IS MORE FEASIBLE. WELL WE CAN

02:29:00.231 --> 02:29:02.033
WORK TOGETHER TO RESOLVE THE

02:29:02.099 --> 02:29:02.633
MAJORITY OF THIS THESE

02:29:02.700 --> 02:29:06.203
PROBLEMS. THE CITY OF TIJUANA

02:29:06.270 --> 02:29:07.204
WE EXPECT WILL CONTINUE TO GROW.

02:29:07.271 --> 02:29:09.407
AND OFTENTIMES THAT GROWTH

02:29:09.473 --> 02:29:11.609
COMES WITH DISCONNECTION TO THE

02:29:11.676 --> 02:29:14.679
SEWER SYSTEM. AND WE COULD

02:29:14.745 --> 02:29:16.580
EXPECT THAT WE WILL CONTINUE AS

02:29:16.647 --> 02:29:19.617
THE CITY GROWS THIS PROBLEM

02:29:19.684 --> 02:29:20.084
CONTINUE TO GROW LYSIS

02:29:20.151 --> 02:29:20.985
ADDRESSED. SO WE HAVE

02:29:21.052 --> 02:29:23.587
INTRODUCED THIS BILL. WHICH

02:29:23.654 --> 02:29:25.456
WOULD CREATE A- A MITIGATION

02:29:25.523 --> 02:29:27.591
PROGRAM- ON BOTH SIDES OF THE

02:29:27.658 --> 02:29:30.661
BORDER. THAT WOULD OF AN

02:29:30.728 --> 02:29:32.530
ESSENCE CREATE A WATERSHED STE.

02:29:32.596 --> 02:29:35.666
MANAGEMENT STRATEGY TO ENSURE

02:29:35.733 --> 02:29:37.635
THAT AS OF THE CITY OF TIJUANA

02:29:37.702 --> 02:29:42.039
CONTINUES TO GROW. THAT. THEY

02:29:42.106 --> 02:29:43.107
TAKE MEASURES TO PREVENT RUN

02:29:43.174 --> 02:29:45.443
OFF AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ASK

02:29:45.509 --> 02:29:47.345
WELL HOW COULD WE WRITE A BILL

02:29:47.411 --> 02:29:50.414
THAT WILL COMPEL MEXICO TO DO

02:29:50.481 --> 02:29:52.350
ANYTHING WE REALLY CAT BUT WHAT

02:29:52.416 --> 02:29:55.219
WE CAN. DO IS PUT UP CALIFORNIA

02:29:55.286 --> 02:29:57.788
AND IN A POSITION. TO ADVOCATE

02:29:57.855 --> 02:29:59.790
FOR THIS PROBLEM. AND AS WE

02:29:59.857 --> 02:30:02.026
ALLOCATE THREE HUNDRED MILLION

02:30:02.093 --> 02:30:02.626
DOLLARS SOME OF THAT MONEY MAY

02:30:02.693 --> 02:30:05.196
GO. TO BE SPENT ON BOTH SIDES

02:30:05.262 --> 02:30:07.131
OF THE BORDER. THAT'S WHY THE

02:30:07.198 --> 02:30:08.799
TIME THE BILL IS ESSENTIAL TO

02:30:08.866 --> 02:30:10.768
GETTING THIS BILL OUT. IN THE

02:30:10.835 --> 02:30:13.137
NEXT A FEW MONTHS. IS GOING TO

02:30:13.204 --> 02:30:14.438
BE ESSENTIAL TO MAKE

02:30:14.505 --> 02:30:17.208
MAINTAINING. SUIT TO GIVING

02:30:17.274 --> 02:30:19.076
CALIFORNIA LEVERAGE ON HOW

02:30:19.143 --> 02:30:20.811
THOSE FUNDS FUNDS ARE SPENT.

02:30:20.878 --> 02:30:22.847
AND ADDING THIS TO ANY WORK

02:30:22.913 --> 02:30:25.116
PLAN THAT WE CAN AGREE TO WITH

02:30:25.182 --> 02:30:26.450
MEXICO WITH THROUGH THE

02:30:26.517 --> 02:30:28.586

03:33:00.167 --> 03:33:01.034
THAT'S ONE THING I WANTED TO

03:33:01.101 --> 03:33:02.769
CLARIFY THE OTHER THING IS THAT

03:33:14.515 --> 03:33:19.353
WHAT I'M ABOUT IN TERMS OF. WHY

BECAUSE OF THESE AMENDMENTS

03:33:43.977 --> 03:33:46.647
GOING TO POSE IT EVERYBODY WAS

03:33:46.713 --> 03:33:47.214
OPPOSED BECAUSE THE MINISTER

WHEN I GET IN THERE. IS THAT

03:33:55.389 --> 03:33:58.892
CORRECT. WELL I MEAN THE

WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT IS THE

03:34:06.600 --> 03:34:08.202
PEOPLE I REPRESENT AND ALTHOUGH

03:34:08.268 --> 03:34:10.837
IT'S THAT. THAT WE REPRESENT

03:34:10.904 --> 03:34:12.639
TRAIT THAT I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE

03:34:12.706 --> 03:34:14.508

03:34:48.342 --> 03:34:51.378
CONVERSATION- EVEN THOUGH THEY

03:34:51.445 --> 03:34:54.982

03:35:20.207 --> 03:35:22.809
DIFFICULT AREA TO TRY TO

LEGISLATE IN AND CERTAINLY HAVE

03:35:24.444 --> 03:35:26.179

AROUND THE STATE THAT WE'RE

03:35:31.318 --> 03:35:33.754
SEEING IN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.

03:35:33.820 --> 03:35:34.621
HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT TAXPAYERS

03:35:34.688 --> 03:35:36.290

03:35:38.792 --> 03:35:40.594
CREATES AN ISSUE OR EVEN WHEN I

03:35:40.661 --> 03:35:41.795
TO WELCH'S LEFT BEHIND IS

03:35:41.862 --> 03:35:44.064
SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN OF.

03:35:44.131 --> 03:35:44.598

03:35:48.869 --> 03:35:51.138
DIFFICULT PLACE TO BE WHEN YOU

03:35:51.204 --> 03:35:52.005
HAVE A BILL THAT HAS

03:35:52.072 --> 03:35:54.508
OPPOSITION. AND THE POSITION.

03:35:54.574 --> 03:35:57.144

03:35:57.210 --> 03:35:58.312
THIS COMMITTEE FELT THAT IT WAS

03:35:58.378 --> 03:35:59.546
REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE A BILL

03:35:59.613 --> 03:36:01.682
THAT DIDN'T INCREASE THE

03:36:01.748 --> 03:36:03.317
POTENTIAL FOR LIABILITY

03:36:03.383 --> 03:36:05.952
SHIFTING. FROM OIL PRODUCERS TO

03:36:06.019 --> 03:36:07.087
TAXPAYERS AND THAT'S WHY THE

03:36:07.154 --> 03:36:08.021
AMENDMENTS WERE PUT INTO PLACE

03:36:08.088 --> 03:36:09.423
AND THAT'S WHY THE BILL

03:36:09.489 --> 03:36:12.159

FOR THE RESIDENTS- AND SO THAT

03:36:19.633 --> 03:36:21.601
WILL ALWAYS BE THE- POSITION

03:36:21.668 --> 03:36:22.803
THAT WETAKE AND KIND OF THE

03:36:22.869 --> 03:36:24.604
SIDE THAT WE TAKE. AND THAT'S

03:36:24.671 --> 03:36:25.605

03:38:32.065 --> 03:38:33.934
EVERY. LEVEL WE SEE THEM

03:38:34.000 --> 03:38:35.669
INTERNATIONALLY WERE RECENT

03:38:35.735 --> 03:38:37.337
RESEARCH RECENTLY RESEARCHERS

03:38:37.404 --> 03:38:38.004
FOUND OUT THAT ONE BILLION

03:38:38.071 --> 03:38:39.940
PEOPLE WILL BE DISPLACED OR

03:38:40.006 --> 03:38:42.809

FOR EVERY ADDITIONAL 1 DEGREES

CELSIUS TEMPERATURE RISE. WE

03:38:46.012 --> 03:38:46.746
SEE THAT AT THE STATE LEVEL

03:38:46.813 --> 03:38:48.882
WHERE RISKY BUSINESS PROJECT

03:38:48.949 --> 03:38:50.517
ESTIMATES EIGHT TO TEN BILLION

03:38:50.584 --> 03:38:52.252

AT RISK DURING HIGH TIDE. AND

03:39:00.227 --> 03:39:01.061
WE SEE THEM AT THE REGIONAL AND

03:39:01.127 --> 03:39:02.996
LOCAL LEVELS WHERE FOR EXAMPLE

03:39:03.063 --> 03:39:04.898
RISKY BUSINESS ESTIMATES THE

03:39:04.965 --> 03:39:06.967
INLAND EMPIRE WILL LOSE UP TO

03:39:07.033 --> 03:39:08.134
THIRTY EIGHT MILLION PER YEAR.

03:39:08.201 --> 03:39:11.505
AND ON DECLINES IN COTTON

03:39:11.571 --> 03:39:12.372
YIELDS. WHAT THE AVAIL RESEARCH

03:39:12.439 --> 03:39:13.440
THROUGH PROJECTS LIKE RISKY

03:39:13.507 --> 03:39:15.275
BUSINESS CLEAR IS THAT

03:39:15.342 --> 03:39:16.576
VIRTUALLY EVERY CORNER OF OUR

03:39:16.643 --> 03:39:17.911
LIVES WILL BE UPENDED BY THE

03:39:17.978 --> 03:39:19.446
CLIMATE CRISIS. BUT DESPITE THE

03:39:19.513 --> 03:39:20.547
VALUE RESEARCH CURRENTLY

03:39:20.614 --> 03:39:22.916
AVAILABLE CALIFORNIA DOES NOT

03:39:22.983 --> 03:39:23.950
REQUIRE A SYSTEMIC REVIEW OF

03:39:24.017 --> 03:39:25.852
OUR CLIMATE LIABILITIES. THESE

03:39:25.919 --> 03:39:27.454
OUT ANALYSES ARE NOT ONLY

03:39:27.521 --> 03:39:30.423
POSSIBLE BUT CRITICAL SO THAT

03:39:30.490 --> 03:39:31.057
WE CAN PINPOINT PRECISELY WHERE

03:39:31.124 --> 03:39:32.425
WE HAD MOST VULNERABLE ACT

03:39:32.492 --> 03:39:35.962
AGGRESSIVELY TO REDUCE RISK. SB

03:39:36.029 --> 03:39:36.563

03:39:36.630 --> 03:39:37.697
GAP BY PROVIDING FOR THE

03:39:37.764 --> 03:39:38.765
REGULAR PRODUCTION OF OUR

03:39:38.832 --> 03:39:40.734
CLIMATE ASSESSMENT. REQUIRING

03:39:40.800 --> 03:39:41.902
THAT THE ASSESSMENT STUDIES

03:39:41.968 --> 03:39:43.737
IMPACT ECONOMIC IMPACTS

03:39:43.803 --> 03:39:45.272
ALONGSIDE THE RISK OF CLIMATE

03:39:45.338 --> 03:39:47.374
CHANGE. TO OUR STATE'S BUILT

03:39:47.440 --> 03:39:50.043
NATURAL AND SOCIAL SYSTEMS.

03:39:50.110 --> 03:39:51.378
RECENT AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL

03:39:51.444 --> 03:39:53.079
REQUIRE OPR TO ASSESS POTENTIAL

03:39:53.146 --> 03:39:54.681
ADAPTATION AND MITIGATION

03:39:54.748 --> 03:39:58.285

03:39:58.351 --> 03:39:58.852
COSTS AND BENEFITS OF ACTION

03:39:58.919 --> 03:40:00.253
READ REPORT. EXAMINATIONS OF

03:40:00.320 --> 03:40:01.421
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUES

ON THE PROVISION OF THE BILL

04:17:25.129 --> 04:17:27.698

THE CONSTRUCTION OF STATIONS

04:17:52.223 --> 04:17:54.692

04:17:54.759 --> 04:17:56.961
STATIONS. IF THEY'RE ON

04:17:57.028 --> 04:18:00.131

CONSTRUCTION OF STATIONS WHICH

04:18:43.474 --> 04:18:45.176

THE PRESENTATIONS THAT YOUR

04:22:09.780 --> 04:22:11.615

04:23:07.938 --> 04:23:09.406
PROJECT THAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY

04:23:09.473 --> 04:23:11.709
EASILY GOING TO CATEGORY WHERE

04:23:11.775 --> 04:23:14.545
IT NEEDS TO OPEN A VIRAL CLEAR-

04:23:14.612 --> 04:23:16.180
AS PART OF A REGIONAL

04:23:16.247 --> 04:23:18.482

EXEMPTION AND THIS ALSO DOES

04:23:42.072 --> 04:23:42.907
NOT CHANGE ANY EXISTING

04:23:42.973 --> 04:23:44.708
ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS AIR

04:23:44.775 --> 04:23:47.378

WORKS. I THOUGHT AN EXEMPTION

04:24:06.564 --> 04:24:08.666
