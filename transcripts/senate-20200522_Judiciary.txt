PRESENTING THIS WITH THAT UNDERSTANDING APPRECIATE YOUR CAN HEAR EFFORTS HERE THIS A FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUE AND I THINK THE ANALYSIS IT DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB IDENTIFYING THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE IN TODAY'S WORLD ON THIS TOPIC- BUT APPRECIATE YOUR HARD WORK ON IT AND PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PROCEED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CHAIR JACKSON AND SENATORS THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SB EIGHT NINETY A BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITES REMOVE PHOTOGRAPHS OR VIDEO RECORDINGS OF A CRIME POSTED BY THE PERPETRATOR. AT THE REQUEST OF THE CRIME VICTIM OF THE FAMILY WHO- WAS THE TICKET IN THE CONTENT AND THAT THEY WOULD BE REMOVED WITHIN TWO HOURS AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK SENATE JACKSON TO DO JUST FOR YOU COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS BILL. I INTRODUCED THIS BILL BECAUSE I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT VICTIMS OF THE SALT BEING RE VICTIMIZED BY PUBLICATIONS OF IMAGES OR VIDEOS OF THEIR ASSAULT BY THE PERPETRATOR THEMSELVES ON SOCIAL MEDIA. FOR EXAMPLE ON MARCH TWENTY TEN TWENTY NINETEEN. ONE CHURCH MEETING WHAT FIFTY PEOPLE DEAD WHICH WAS LIVES. ON SOCIAL MEDIA AS IT HAPPENED BY THE PERPETRATOR OF THE CRIME OVER TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE WATCHED A LIVE VIDEO PLATFORM BY SOCIAL MEDIA. AND HERE IN SACRAMENTO A LEADING ANTI BAXTER PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED ME ON A PUBLIC STREET AND LYFT AND IT. THIS ASSAULT ON SOCIAL MEDIA TO THE ADULATION OF HIS FOLLOWERS. AND SO THE SIX OF THIS VIDEO COULD INCITE FURTHER ATTACKS ON LATE LEADERS IN FACT ONLY IF YOU LATER ANOTHER ACTIVE. THAT ONTO THE FLOOR LET'S CITY FOR. THE BILL DOOR BY THE- SLEEVE CAUGHT BECAUSE RATE HEY SAID IN THEN CROP AGAINST ASIANS ISLAND HAVE STE. DURING COVER NINETEENTH. INCLUDING VIDEOS OF VIOLENT THE- ASIANS. PACIFIC ISLANDERS ON SO MEDIA. IN FACT THE NEWLY LAUNCHED A HATE INCIDENT TRACTOR STOP AT I HATE WHICH IS CREATED BY COALITION OF CALIFORNIA EIGHTY I FOCUS NONPROFIT GROUPS HAS RECEIVED MORE THAN ELEVEN HUNDRED REPORTS. OF CORONAVIRUS DISCRIMINATION AGAINST ASIAN AMERICANS IN JUST TWO WEEKS. FORTUNATELY MANY OF THESE RACIST HATEFUL ACTS ARE RECORDED AND STREAMED ON SOCIAL MEDIA. ON FEBRUARY TWENTY THIRD TWENTY TWENTY TWO MINUTES SAN FRANCISCO RECORDED THEMSELVES. THEY RECORD THEMSELVES STRIKING AN ELDERLY ASIAN MAN WITH A METAL POLE. THIS VIDEO IS POSTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND WENT VIRAL. AND IN THE VIDEO AT LEAST ONE PERSON TO BE SAID SAYING I HATE ASIANS. THESE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF HOW SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITES HAVE PLATFORM TROUBLING CONTENT PUBLICIZING VIOLENCE ACROSS PLATFORMS. WHICH IT FURTHER TRAUMATIZED VICTIMS OF VIOLENT CRIMES. THE BILL SEEKS TO DENY PERPETRATORS OF VIOLENCE FROM BENEFITING FROM THEIR OWN VIOLENT ACTS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE VICTIMS. HOWEVER AS WE WORKED WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF TO ADDRESS THE FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUES WE RECOGNIZE WE WOULD NOT HAVE THE TIME TO CRAFT A SOLUTION THAT MET CONSTITUTIONAL MUSTER. I DO WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THE INTENTION OF THE BILL IS NOT TO PREVENT ANYONE EVEN PERPETRATORS OF ASSAULT FROM EXPRESSING THEIR OWN VIEWS. ARE EVEN POSTING ABOUT COMMITTING CRIMINAL ACTS. THIS BILL WAS SEEKING TO REGULATE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES FROM DISSEMINATING IMAGES ARE PLATFORMING IMAGES OF CRIMINAL VIOLENCE TO OTHER PEOPLE ON THE PLATFORM WHICH COULD ALSO INCLUDE. THE ASSAULT VICTIM AND HER FAMILY AND FRIENDS. THE BILL REQUIRES SOCIAL MEDIA SITES REMOVED VIDEOS POPE POSTED BY THE PERPETRATORS THEMSELVES NOT VIDEOS THAT WERE POSTED BY NEWS MEDIA SITES ARE ACTUALLY ANY OTHER PERSON WHO MAY HAVE A COPY OF THE VIDEO TAKEN AROUND VIDEO. I DO WANT TO THANK THE INTERNET ASSOCIATION AND SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES TYPICALLY TWITTER AND FACEBOOK WHO HAVE OPENED A DIALOGUE WITH ME ABOUT THE SIMULATION OF VIOLENCE ON SOCIAL MEDIA THE INTERNET. AND I URGE SOCIAL MEDIA SITES TO CONTINUE WORKING TOGETHER ALONG WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT TO COMBAT HATE. AND DEVELOP A BETTER RESPONSE MORE EXPEDITIOUSLY REMOVED VIOLENT LIVE STREAM VIDEOS POSTED BY CRIME PERPETRATORS OF VICTIMS CAN BE PROTECTED FROM FUTURE HARM. I LOOK FOR TO BRING LEGISLATION NEXT YEAR TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE WHEN WE HAVE MORE TIME TO THAT THE COMPLEX ISSUES INVOLVED. SO AGAIN I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THE FROM THE CHAIR THAT SB EIGHT NINETY BE HOLDING COMMITTEE WITHOUT OF THOSE THAT REALLY WANT TO THANK AGAIN THE CHAIR. ALLOW ME TO THIS OPPORTUNITY TO STILL PRESENT THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR PENN AND THIS IS INDEED A VERY TROUBLING ISSUE WE ARE WE HAS LEARNED THAT.

ISSUE BUT WE KNOW THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS A REVERED. ATTENTION OF AND FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF OUR DEMOCRACY SO I APPRECIATE.

ARE YOU CAN ARE YOU THERE YOUR ME NOW YES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I JUST WANTED TO SOME CLARIFICATION MAYBE ALL FOR EIGHTY- RECOMMENDATION FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE BY THE AUTHOR- I'M LOOKING AT. SEARCHING TO ON LINES THIRTY SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT OF THE BILL THAT DEFINES VICTIM. CANON IDENTIFIES THAT THE INDIVIDUAL BE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT FOUND TO HAVE SUSTAINED PHYSICAL OR FINANCIAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY SO MY QUESTION TO YOU ARE THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL- IS AS YOU REVISIT THIS ISSUE AND RESUBMIT NEXT YEAR ALRIGHT IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL FOR CONSTITUTIONAL. SINCE OUR TO LIMIT IT TO PHYSICAL INJURIES- AS OPPOSED TO FINANCIAL INJURIES ARSENAL PROPERTY. THAT JUSTIN I. JUST OBSERVATION I THINK COULD HELP- YOUR CALL IS AS YOU TRY TO MINIMIZE INDIVIDUALS ABILITY TO EXPLOIT OUR WHAT OTHERWISE WOULD BE A CRIME. YOU KNOW IT'S THE ELDER HAD ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT. SENATOR PAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND- CENTER BUDGETS I APPRECIATE- THAT INSIGHT AND- CERTAINLY WILL TAKE IT INTO CONSIDERATION THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE BILL ACTUALLY WAS ON- PHYSICAL ASSAULTS ARE A PHYSICAL. ATTACKS SO CERTAINLY THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THAT MY ORIGINAL THINKING ABOUT THE BILL AND APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THAT UP THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU SENATOR BOARD JUST SENATOR MONNING. THANK YOU MDAM CHAIR I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I THINK. THE COMMITTEE THAT IS COMMITTED TO PROTECTING FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS ALSO RECOGNISES THOSE ARE NOT ABSOLUTE. AND THE SCENARIOS THE EXAMPLES YOU'VE SHARED. NOT ONLY ARE EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE FEATURING REAL TIME VIOLENCE BUT ALSO REAL TIME VIOLENCE THAT COULD INCITE FURTHER VIOLENCE SO. APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORT- JUST A QUESTION- MAYBE SOMETHING TO LOOK AT I NOTICED IN THE CRITERIA TO SECURE. SOME THE CMPLIANCE BY THE SOCIAL MEDIA ONE OF THE CRITERIA IS- A POLICE REPORT. IN IN MY EXPERIENCE. PLEASE REPORTS ARE NOT ALWAYS AVAILABLE PROXIMATE TO THE TIME OF THE COMMISSION OF THE CRIME EVEN IF THE POLICE HAVE BEEN ON SCENE OR TAKEN WITNESS STATEMENTS OFTEN YOU HAVE TO WAIT A LONG TIME TO GET A POLICE REPORT IN TO EVEN GET IN NUMBER THAT A POLICE REPORT EXIST SO I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT THAT MAYBE TALK TO. FOLKS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. THAT CRITERIA COULD PUSH. COULD SUSPEND GETTING THE ACTION YOU WANT FROM THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM. BECAUSE THEY DON'T GENERATE THE POLICE REPORT. IN A TIMELY FASHION SO JUST TO THE CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER MONEY ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS AGAIN THANK YOU FOR BRINGING TIS BILL SENATOR PAN IT'S GOT A LOT OF CHALLENGES BUT IT TO I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT THE VICTIM SHOULD NOT TO BE RE VICTIMIZED BY THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR.

TO SORT OUT THE VERY COMPLEX ISSUES AND CERTAINLY I KNOW THAT EVERYONE HERE CLEAN MYSELF AS A VERY STRONG THE CENTER OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT THAT IS A YOU KNOW CORNERSTONE OF OUR CONSTITUTION WELL BE SURE WE PROTECT THAT- BUT WE ALSO UNDERSTAND I THINK THE CENTER MINING SAID IS THAT. IT'S NOT WITHOUT SOME BOUNDARIES AND WE DO NEED TO BE SURE THAT WE ALSO PROTECT VICTIMS OF CRIME WHILE ALLOWING EVERYONE TO BE ABLE TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES FULLY AND OUR OUR- COUNTRY THANKS VERY MUCH AND APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU SENATOR PAN THIS WOULD MAKE QUITE AN INTERESTING BAR EXAM QUESTION ONE OF.

SIR BRIDGES I THINK YOU HIT THE BUTTON AGAIN AND YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BECAUSE THEY'LL- ON MUTUAL HERE DON'T ASK ME HOW IT WORKS. THAT THERE YOU GO WE HEAR YOU NOW. IT JUST SO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IS A BUBBLE POPS UP AND ASKS ME TO PUSH IT TO ON MUTE. SO I THINK. THAT'S THE REASON WHY THERE'S A LADY I APOLOGIZE I'M SURE IT'S- YOU DON'T NEED TO POP. OKAY THANK YOU IF I MAY POSE A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR. ON THIS IS A- AN INTERESTING IDEA- I GOT A- COUPLE OF QUICK QUESTIONS IS. WHY IT. WAS WHY IS THIS PROGRAM OR THIS THIS MODIFICATION LIMITED ONLY TO GOLDEN STATE SCHOLAR SURE FIVE TWO NINE PROGRAM THE STATE MANAGED PROGRAM AND NOT ANY OTHER PROVIDER OF FIVE TO NINE. SET ASIDES OUR THE SECOND IS WORRIED ABOUT MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS BEING OPEN AND INDIVIDUALS WANTING TO USE THIS FOR- NEFARIOUS PURPOSES TO MOVE MONEY- WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE TO ALLOW IT TO HAVE A CUMULATIVE EVEN FROM ON EVEN FROM MULTIPLE PARTIES ALLOW WHICH ONLY HAVE ONE ACCOUNT. PER CHILD. DOES YOUR DOES YOUR TO THE QUESTIONS OUT OF THE GATES IF I MAKING OUT- POSE THEM TO THE ALTAR RESPONSE SURE- SO THERE IT NEARLY NINETY DIFFERENT FIVE TO NINE PLANS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. AND EVEN IF YOU'RE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO OPEN UP A SCHOLARSHIP FIVE TWO NINE WHICH IS ARE CALIFORNIA ONE. A DEPENDING ON YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISER FOR EXAMPLE THEY MAY RECOMMEND THAT YOU OPEN UP A FIVE TWO NINE ACCOUNT IN SOME OTHER STATE. SO THIS BILL IS REALLY TO PROTECT OUR CALIFORNIANS WHO OUT FILE BANKRUPTCY AND TO YOU KNOW PROTECT THEIR FAMILIES AND THER CHILD SAVINGS ACCOUNTS- ARE YOU ASKING WHETHER THIS BILL WOULD BE LIMITED TO. CHILD UP FOR ACCOUNT THAT WOULD BE PROTECTED UNDER BANKRUPTCY. BUT LET'S GO BACK TO THE FIRST ONE. GIFTS THIS ONLY PERTAINS TO THE STATE MANAGED PROGRAM- MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME UNDERSTAND THE RATIONALE AS TO WHY IT ONLY APPLIES. TO THE STATE MANAGED PROGRAM AND NOT ANY OTHER FIVE TWO NINE PROGRAM WHETHER IT'S IN STATE OR OUT OF STATE. FOR THE CHAIR PLEASE OKAY THANK YOU YES SO- WE REALLY WANT TO ENCOURAGE FOLKS IN CALIFORNIA TO OPEN UP THE CALIFORNIA SCHOLAR SHARE FIVE TWO NINE ACCOUNT. WE CANNOT MANDATED WE'RE ONE OF THE FEW STATES THAT DOES NOT OFFER A TAX CREDIT OR TAX INCENTIVE UP FOR OPENING UP AN ACCOUNT HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO A LOT OF THESE ACCOUNTS ARE- IF YOU'RE WITH A LARGE FINANCIAL ADVISER- MAYBE VANGUARD OR SCHWALB WAR. ONE OF THE OTHER- TO USE. TRY TO ENCOURAGE THEIR CUSTOMERS TO. INVEST THEIR MONEY INTO PLANTS WHERE THEY GET SOME SORT OF INCENTIVE RIGHT FINANCIAL ADVISORS SO THAT'S THE REASON THAT THEY DON'T NECESSARILY RECOMMEND OPENING UP ON IN CALIFORNIA. BUT FOR CALIFORNIA BANKRUPTCY LAWS WE REALLY CAN ONLY PASS LAWS THAT PROTECT CALIFORNIANS SO THEREFORE IF THEY OPEN UP A SCHOLARSHIP FIVE TWO NINE THE COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL SEEKS TO PROTECT THOSE CALIFORNIANS FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO OPEN UP THE ACCOUNTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. ANY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS CENTER BORDERS IF NOT WE'LL GO TO JUST. WORRIED ABOUT PEOPLE MOVING. TOO MUCH MONE AROUND- THERE'S AN AGGREGATE LIMIT- BUT WOULD IT NOT BE POSSIBLE TO ALSO ALLOWED TO APPLY TO ONLY ONE. ONE ACCOUNT HER CHILD. WHEN WE HAD S. C. AUTHORED TO RESPOND TO THAT. WELL FARM. ON PAGE FOUR OF THE BILL IT JUST SAYS MONEY HELD IN THE ACCOUNT. ON BY THE- JUDGMENT DEBTOR AND ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO THE GOLDEN STATE SCHOLARSHIP TRUST ACT. THE CITY DOESN'T YOU KNOW IT DID YOU GET INTO A DIFFERENT SECTION BUT WE'RE JUST ADDING SECTION TWELVE SO NO TYPICALLY IN BANKRUPTCY IT'S WHETHER IT'S REASONABLE MAN I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT COSTS TO GO TO USC BUT IF YOU HAD FOUR YEARS WORTH OF MONEY IN THERE AND YOU HAD ONE KID OR TWO KIDS THAT THE TRUSTEE IN BANKRUPTCY FEWER BEFORE THEM- THEY WOULD THEY WOULD THINK WHAT IS THIS A REASONABLE AMOUNT TO GO IN LAST PLACE SAID CIVIL. COURT JUDGE IN CALIFORNIA WOULD LOOK AT THE WOULD LOOK AT THE REASONABLENESS OF THAT EXEMPTION FOR JUDGMENT CREDITOR CAME AND SAID THEY WANT TO CATCH IT YOU CLAIM THE EXEMPTION SAYS THE DEBTOR WITH THE JUDGMENT DEBTOR AND THEN IT THE FAX THE CAKE WHAT IT IS.THAT'S I THINK THE FACTS ARE MOST THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THERE NOT AT THE HIGH END ON THIS MOST PEOPLE GOT TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND BUCKS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THE KIDS EDUCATION GENERALLY IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. SENATOR JONES. REAL QUICK YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT A CO MINGLING- AND- THAT HADN'T SHOWN UP AND SO I WAS INTRIGUED BY THAT IF YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT COMMINGLING OF FUNDS FROM OTHER SOURCES PETER THE CHAIR SENATOR JONES THAT THANK YOU I MEAN ANYONE CAN OPEN UP A FIVE TWO NINE ACCOUNT FOR A CHILD- A LOT OF PEOPLE NOW ARE SAYING WILL START OF. GIVING THE KID A TOOL WHY DON'T YOU CONTRIBUTE A HUNDRED DOLLARS. TO THEIR FIVE TWO NINE FOR THEIR COLLEGE ACCOUNTS SO THAT'S WHAT COMMINGLED MEANS. IT'S NOT NECESSARYJUST THE PARENTS THAT PUT IN MONEY COULD BE GRANDPARENTS AUNTS AND UNCLES GOT PARENTS. FRIENDS AND WE YOU KNOW. SAVE OKAY INS AND SO ONCE THOSE ONCE THOSE FUNDS ARE. IN THE ACCOUNT ONLY THE PARENTS HAVE CONTROL OF THE ACCOUNT DOES THAT CORRECT THAT'S RIGHT HELLO. YOU CAN ADD ON I'M SORRY DO WE HAVE I'M SORRY STATE YOUR NAME PLEASE THAT'S A STAND ZERO- WITH THE SCHOLARSHIP INVESTMENT FOR WORK WITH IN QUICKEN TURNER'S OFFICE- JUST TO ADD TO THAT- SO EXPOSURE ACCOUNTS. AGAIN FISHER CAN HAVE MULTIPLE SCHOLARSHIP ACCOUNTS ON BY DIFFERENT PEOPLE LIKE THE PARENTS OR THE GRANDPARENTS FOR OTHER PARTIES. AND ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THOSE PARTIES CAN HELP SAVE FOR THAT ONE BETTER FISHERIES COLLEGE EDUCATION IS BENEFICIARY HAS A MAXIMUM THAT THEY CAN HAVE SAY WITHIN AN ACCOUNT AND THAT'S- THAT'S ALL OF THE ACCOUNTS UNDER THE BENEFICIARIES NAY. THERE'S A LIMIT TO THAT- WITHIN THE SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM. AND SO. AS FAR AS THE QUESTION ABOUT. MINGLING THERE'S AN OPTION TO IF YOU HAVE A SINGLE ACCOUNT MULTIPLE PEOPLE CAN MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THEIR FRIENDS FAMILIES. SO ESSENTIALLY ONE BENEFICIARY IF YOU ADD UP ALL THEIR ACCOUNTS IS MEANT TO. SUPPORT THEIR- EDUCATION- IS FAR AS A TELLING ONE ACCOUNT VERSUS ANOTHER IT'S KIND OF ALL TOGETHER. IS MEANT TO FUND THEIR WHOLE COLLEGE EDUCATION AND WITH A MAXIMUM OUT SORRY TO THE CHAU CERTAINLY THE MAXIMUM OUT FOR DISCLOSURE PROGRAM IS FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO WHAT THE BENEFICIARY REACHES THAT AMOUNT. ALL OF THEIR SCHOLARS ACCOUNTS. ON THE YOU KNOW THEY CAN'T CONTRIBUTE ANYMORE. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THAT'S AWFUL. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

I'M HERE THE MORNING EVERYONE. MANAGER IF YOU WOULD INDULGE ME FOR A MOMENT I WOULD LOVE TO LET MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE KNOW JUST A LITTLE HARDER THEY HAVE YEAH BUT I DON'T THINK I'M ON YEAH OKAY. NOT A WORRY THERE YOU GO I'M WELL BUT THIRD AGAIN PLEASE OKAY VERY GOOD GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR GOOD MORNING MEMBERS. MADAM CHAIR IF YOU WOULD INDULGE ME FOR JUST A MOMENT I WOULD LIKE TO LET EACH MEMBER KNOW HOW MANY MOBILE HOME PARKS THEY HAVE. IN THEIR DISTRICT- MADAM CHAIR YOU HAVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE PARKS. BY SURE BORCHERS YOU HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE. SENATOR RAWSON YOU HAVE THREE PARKS SENATOR GONZALEZ YOU HAVE SIXTY SEVEN PARKS. SENATOR JONES YOU HAVE TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY SENATOR MONEY YOUR WINNER WITH TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SIX. SENATOR STERN YOU HAVE FORTY TWO SENATOR NUMBER YOU HAVE EIGHTY SEVEN AND SENATOR WHY CAL SKI HAS FIFTY TWO. I LIKE TO LET PEOPLE KNOW BECAUSE WE DON'T ALWAYS KNOW HOW MANY WE HAVE IN OUR MOBILE HOME PARKS. ARE WHERE SOME OF OUR MEMBERS LIVE A CONSTITUENTS LIVE AND IT IS THE LAST BASTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. SBNINE FIFTEEN WOULD CREATE A PROTECTIVE PROCESS FOR MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS IMPACTED BY COVERT NINETEEN. BY PREVENTING THE MANAGEMENT OF MOBILE HOME PARKS FROM TERMINATING OR ATTEMPTING TO TERMINATE. THE TENANCY OF AFFECTED RESIDENTS DURING A DECLARED STATE OR LOCAL EMERGENCY RELATED TO COVERED NINETEEN. IT WOULD ALSO GIVE MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS THE RIGHT AN OPPORTUNITY TO REPAY TO AVOID EVICTIONS. MOBILE HOMES ARE VITAL TO OUR COMMUNITIES THEY MAKE UP 10% OF CALIFORNIA'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK. IN MOST CASES MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS ARE COMPRISED OF THE STATE'S MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION. INCLUDING SENIORS VETERANS IMMIGRANTS AND LOW ARE ON FIXED INCOME INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. MOBILE HOMES ARE IN FOR AFFORDABLE ALTERNATIVE BUT THE RESIDENTS LIVING IN MOBILE HOME PARKS FACE UNIQUE HOUSING CIRCUMSTANCES. THE LAW DEFINES MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS AS BOTH HOMEOWNERS AND TENANTS BECAUSE THE RESIDENT OWNS THE MOBILE HOME BUT THE PARK OWNS LAND UNDERNEATH THE MOBILE HOME. TO ADDRESS THE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES MOBILE HOMES FALL UNDER A DIFFERENT CIVIL CODE SECTION AND ARE GOVERNED BY THE MOBILE HOME RESIDENCY LOT THE M. R. L. OR THE BY. ALL WE ARE WELL OF GOVERNOR NEWSOME SECOND IN ORDER END TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY BANNING THE ENFORCEMENT OF INFECTIONS OF RESIDENTS AFFECTED BY COVERT NINETEEN BUT THE ORDER WAS NOT SPECIFIC TO MORRELL SECTIONS THE GOVERNMENT WILL HOMES AND PROTECT MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS SB NINE FIFTEEN ADDRESSES THE SPECIFIC GAPS BY DEVELOPING AN EVICTION PREVENTION POLICY PROTECTING MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS AFFECTED BY COVERT NINETEEN WE BELIEVE WITH CLARIFICATION THE OWNERS SECOND ORDER COULD BE MISINTERPRETED TO THE DETRIMENT OF MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS ULTIMATELY SB NINE FIFTEEN TO GIVE AFFECTED MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS. GREATER CHANCE IN IN A MOBILE HOME BRING THIS PANDEMIC AND REASONABLE TIME AFTER THIS MORNING SPEAKING IN SUPPORT IS BRUCE STATEN FROM GOLDEN STATE MANUFACTURED HOMEOWNERS LEAGUE OR G. O. L. THINK ABOUT HERE. THANK YOU ARE SENATOR LEYVA OUT WE DO HAVE AS I UNDERSTAND IT A MISTER STANTON BY PHONE AGAIN- WE WILL BE LIMITING EACH SIDE TO A TOTAL OF THREE MINUTES OF ACTUAL TESTIMONY. AND THOSE WHO WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE- AFTER THAT WILL BE ASKED TO JUST GIVE THEIR NAME AFFILIATION AND INDICATE THEIR PORT. AT THE LET US GO TO. OTHER ANY WITNESSES HERE IN ROOM FORTY TWO OR THREE. SEEING NONE THERE ARE NONE IN TWENTY FORTY WE WILL GO NOW TO THE PHONES FOR MISTER STANTON. AND I BELIEVE OF THE TOTAL IS THREE MINUTES SIDE I BELIEVE YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER WITNESSES THAT IS CORRECT TESTIMONY SO MISTER STANTON YOU DON'T NEED TO USE THE ALL THE THREE MINUTES BUT YOU DO HAVE THREE MINUTES IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND PROCEED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BRUCE STATUS GENERAL COUNSEL FOR G. S. OF A WELL IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. I THINK WE CAN AGREE THAT AT NO TIME IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY AS THE PROTECTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT LOCAL HOMEOWNERS. OR EIGHT IT BACK NOW. THE POPULATION PREDOMINATELY COMPRISED OF SENIORS IMMIGRANTS ABOUT FIXED INCOMES GLOBAL HOMEOWNERS ARE UNIQUELY AT RISK OF THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL RESPONSES TO DATE BUT IS MENTIONED THE GOVERNOR'S ORDER IN MARCH. ESSENTIALLY WE- DEALT WITH THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE FICTION IS DURING THE TO CLEAR STATE OF EMERGENCY BUT DID NOT SPECIFY. THAT ENTITIES COULD NOT BE TERMINATED BY NOTICE OR THAT EVE ADDICTION ACTIONS COULD BE FILE. WE HAD ON APRIL SIX THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ORDER THAT SAYS THE COURT CANNOT FILE- COMPLAINTS OR SEVEN SPREAD LAWFULLY TATERS. BUT AGAIN THAT WATER DID NOT ADDRESS THE THREATENING OF ADDICTIONS OR THE SERVING UP THEY THINK SHOULD NOTICES OR RENT INCREASE NOTICES OR ANY PROCEDURE FOR A MOBILE HOME OWNERS TO DEFER PAYMENT OF FRANK'S. DUTY INCOME LOST BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE ENACTED VARYING FORMS OF RELIEF INCLUDING RANT JURISDICTION MORATORIUM'S BUT AT PRESENT THERE'S NO UNIFORMS STATE LEGISLATION WHICH COMPREHENSIVELY AND SPECIFICALLY. ADDRESSES COPING NINETEEN PROTECTION FOR MOBILE HOMEOWNERS SB NINE ONE FIVE ALIGNS. WITH FOUR TO FIVE. PRIOR OR AND YOU NEEDED. ADDRESSING COULD SITUATIONS SHOES THAT CONTINUE TO BE SPECIFIED. IN ANY STATE OR LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE. IT PROTECTS RESIDENTS FROM THE THREAT OF THE ADDICTION BY PROHIBITING YOUR SHIPMENTS OF THESE ACTION NOTICES THAT TO DATE CAN STILL BE SIR. THEY CAN INFLICT PANIC EMOTIONAL DISTRESS POTENTIALLY SCARE SOME PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE KIDDING THEIR HOMES. EVEN WITHOUT THE FILING OF THE COURT ACTION. IT ALSO IN THE IN THE INTERESTS OF JUDICIAL ECONOMY AVOID THE POTENTIAL COLLECT BIãU UNLAWFUL DETAINER LITIGATION WHAT THE COURT EVICTION PROCESS REAL. PARK OWNERS ARE STILL ALLOWED TO STIR BEEN COMPLETE SIXTY DAY NOTICE IN THE INTERIM AND THEN QUEUE UP THE FILE EVICTIONS. IT PROVIDES A PROCEDURE FOR REASONABLE RENT DEFERMENT THAT READ FORGIVE AS A PROCESS WHICH THE HOMEOWNER CAN ELECT TO. ADD TO IT AND ENSURES THAT PARK OWNERS WILL BE REPAID. AND IT PROTECTS HOMEOWNERS FROM BEING THREATENED WITH SEVENTEEN NOTICED USED TO CURE RULES VIOLATIONS WHICH THEY MIGHT BE UNABLE TO PERFORM DUE TO AN INABILITY TO HIRE A CONTRACTOR OR ANTI BACK DURING. THE LOCKDOWN. IT PREVENTS PARK OWNERSHIP NOTICING INCREASES A TIME WHEN MANY HOMEOWNERS ARE STRUGGLING ALRIGHT. MARIE THIS BILL PURPOSES TO PROVIDE HOMEOWNERS WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY RENT TO WHO ARE UNABLE TO RESPOND TO BILLS VIOLATIONS. PRECIOUS READING ROOM TO KEEP THEIR HOMES AND AVOID HOMELESSNESS. RESERVATION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE GOAL TO PREVENT INCREASED ALMOST AS WHICH IS ALREADY PREDICTED DERIDING THINK ONE THANK YOU MISTER STANTON THANK YOU FOR YOUR ABOUT YOUR USE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY BACK WE ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL.

PROCEED GOOD MORNING- CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CENTER LEYVA ANSWER GOVERNOR ON BEHALF OF WESTERN MANUFACTURED HOUSING ASSOCIATION WMA AND OPPOSITION TO THE BILL- OBVIOUSLY THESE ARE UNPRECEDENTED TIMES SOME OWNERS ARE NERVOUS JUST LIKE RESIDENTS AND HOW TO GET THROUGH THIS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE CAN PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK AS WE GET THROUGH IT- SO ANYWAY WERE SENSITIVE TO IT AND WE'RE ACTUALLY ALREADY WORKING ON PAYMENT PLANS WITH RESIDENTS AN ABSENCE OF THIS BILL BECAUSE WE DON'T BELIEVE WE CAN EVEN WAIT FOR THE BILL. THE BILL DOES TWO THINGS THE FIRST PART CODIFIES THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER THE INDUSTRY BELIEVES THAT THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER DOES APPLY TO MOBILE HOMES WE ARE NOT-PUTTING IN NOTICES FOR VICTIMS YOU'RE NOT DOING ANY OF THESE THINGS WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE CODIFYING THE GOVERNOR'S DECADE OF ORDER INTO THE CIVIL COME ON COLBERT NINETEEN WE RESPECTFULLY ASK. THAT DOESN'T OCCUR. PART WITH THE WITH. ISSUE THAT YOU'RE ALL BE DEALING NOT ONLY IN SENATE BUT ASSEMBLY. HI YOU DO RETAIN A PLAN WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE THE OF RESTORATION OF MOBILE HOME TENANTS. FOR CLOSING KICKED OUT OF A PARK IT DOESN'T DO ANYONE GOOD. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS WITH THIS BILL. FIRST AND FOREMOST IT HAS US. COVER THE UTILITIES AND OTHER CHARGES THAT RESIDENTS CAN'T PAY. WE ARE MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS THAT TO ROUTE THAT TAKE RENT. WE ARE SIMPLY A PASTOR ON UTILITIES WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS HOT THIS TO A PASS THROUGH ANY KERRY. OF UTILITY AND OTHER CHARGES STATE CHARGES FOR UP TO A YEAR AND A HALF. NUMBER TWO. THE SENATOR DID MODIFYING THE COMMITTEE DID NOTE. THAT THE LIABILITY PROVISION OF HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE EIGHT CD ISSUES HEALTH AND SAFETY VIOLATIONS WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS. THIS WANTS TO GIVE A SIX MONTH LEEWAY. RESIDENTS NOT TO FIX HEALTH AND SAFETY VIOLATIONS. THE OWNERS WOULD ASK FOR LIABILITY PROTECTION AND THROUGHOUT TIS BECAUSE OF SOME HAVE THE HOOK UP THE GENERATOR. THAT IS GENERATING HOMES AND THEY BURNED DOWN THE PARKER'S HOMES WE'RE GOING TO GET LIABILITY FOR IT. OBVIOUSLY NO ONE WANTS TO SEE SOMEONEKICKED OFF FOR A POTTED PLANT ON THEIR PORCH. WITH EACH CD IS THE. ONE THAT LOOKS AT HEALTH AND SAFETY VIOLATIONS. SIX AT A MEETING. I MADE WE WANT TO GET THROUGH THIS WITH RESIDENTS AND WE WANT TO FIND A WAY TO DO IT BUT WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT LANDLORDS ARE ALSO KEPT HOLE BECAUSE OF WE GO BANKRUPT AND WE GO CHAPTER EIGHT YOU'RE GONNA OF HEDGE FUNDS AND ALL THOSE BIG CORPORATIONS BUYING PARKS THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO BUY PARKS THEY'RE GOING TO RENT INCREASES EVERYTIME THEY CAN AND ARE NOT TO BE A SENSITIVE A SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS LIKE US THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERYMUCH NEXT WITNESS HAVE A MINUTE AND FIFTEEN SECONDS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS CHASE AND I COULD WITHOUT AUSTIN GILBERT ROPES AND SMITH ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS ALLIANCE THE LATEST TIME I RATE THE MANY GOOD POINTS MISTER GOVERNOR MADE BUT JUST A COUPLE OF ADDITION. ON SIMPLY HAVING A LOSS OF JOB OR INCOME AND NOT FRANKLY IN AND ABILITY TO PAY YOUR RENT THERE ARE OTHER SOURCES OF INCOME THAT A RESIDENT MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE WHERE THEY MAY BE RECEIVING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE WHICH IS INTENDED TO BE USED FOR EXPENSES JUST LIKE RENT- AT A HIGHER LEVEL WE GROUP THE POINTS FOR GOVERNOR MADE ABOUT THE UNCERTAINTY THE PARK OWNER EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW. I'M WHILE WE'RE SYMPATHETIC TO RESIDENTS THE REAR IS THE NUMBER AGREE WITH AUTHOR WE ARE THE LAW BASS OF AFFORDABLE AND IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS WE'VE LOST HUNDREDS OF PARKS TO DO TO CLOSURE AND WE'VE LOST SEVENTEEN THOUSAND SPACES IN CALIFORNIA AND YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK ANY OF US HAVE THE ABILITY. HOW MAY WERE WON'T BE IN A TO RENT OR HOW WILL NOT PAY THAT UNDER THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL OR UNDER THIS. CONSEQUENTLY MARKING FIRST IT'S A ROLE OF THE DICE IN TERMS OF A PARK OWNERS ABILITY THIS BILL PASSES CONTINUE MAINTAIN THANK YOU SIR. IN TEXAS IF I. BUSINESS THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

FOR ONCE IT'S ONE ZERO PUT YOURSELF INTO THAT CAN. THE. WE DO NOT HAVE ANYONE ELSE CHEWING UP THIS TIME VERY GOOD YOU THEN OF THANK FOR THOSE OF SUPPORT NOW WILL BRING THE DISCO OUT BY TO COMMITTEE HARD TO CHOOSE MAKE IT OR TWO I HAVE OF LIKE CENTER LEYVA HAD A STRONG COMMIT. TO THE PEOPLE WHO IN ON MOLD HOME AS I HAVEN'T LARGE IN OF THEM I DO THE THEY TEND TO BE IN WHERE THE CAR OF HOUSE ARE VERY. I AND MOBILE HOME ON. AND MOVE HOME. IS FIRST. OF ALL BASS. OF THE HOMELESSNESS. AND UNLIKE MOST OTHER CIRCUM. YOU MAY OWN YOU HOME. BUT YOU DON'T ON THE LAW. SO IF YOU ARE AT THE SUBJECT OF AN- YOU LOSE YOUR HOME BECAUSE SINCE OF WOULD BE SAY A MOBILE THEY ARE MOBILE SO TO PROVIDE TO PRE. TO THESE PHONE ARE THINKING IS VERY VERY CREDIT AND NECESSARY AND I WANT TO THE OFF FOR BRING THIS BILL BEFORE I WOULD HI I BELIEVE YOU ARE EX. AS AUTHOR AMENDMENTS THE AMENDMENTS PER IN THE ANALYSIS YES YOU IT WILL NOT THAT ARE. YOU KNOW THERE IS OF COURSE THIS THIS. WORLD EXPERIENCE THING IN TO I THINK WE RECOGNIZE THE BIRD THAT THE BILL DOES SHE OF. AND I AM MINE OF THOSE CAN AND- I BELIEVE THE. BEST POSITION TO HELP SHOULD STEP UP AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHAT YOU ARE CALLING FOR IN THIS BILL- INDEED BECAUSE WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER OUR GREATEST ASSISTANCE. I BELIEVE HAS TO GO TO THOSE WHO ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE AND THE MOST TO LOSE AND AGAIN WHEN YOU LOSE YOUR HOME. THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO IS ADD TO THE HOMELESS POPULATION AND SO WE ARE ASKING EVERYONE TO PLEASE. STEP UP AND DO THAT SO I HAD SOME QUESTIONS BUT I DO KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BILL. TO REACH AN ACCOMMODATION BUT I DO BELIEVE THESE ARE FOLKS WHO DESERVE- WHATEVER ASSISTANCE WE CAN GIVE THEM THAT'S FAIR AND REASONABLE TO ALL PARTIES. SO WITH THAT ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. SENATOR JOBS. I THINK MA'AM CHARGES ONE MAKE A BRIEF STATEMENT- I DON'T KNOW IF I'M THE ONLY BUT ONE OF THE FEW REPUBLICANS AND HAS A HISTORY OF SUPPORT. MOBILE HOME RENT CONTROL. BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THE CHAIR POINTS TO ON THAT- SITUATION. BUTTON FOR TRADE I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT KIND OF FINE EXECUTIVE ORDER I SHARE THE CONCERNS. OF THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION- SO BE VOTING NO TODAY- BUT TO KEEP AN EYE ON IT AS IT PROGRESSES THROUGH THE PROCESSING. THANK YOU SENATOR JONES WHO HAVE BEEN BORCHERS HAS HIS HANDS UP DON'T TOUCH YOUR COMPUTER WE WILL GET YOU ON RIGHT NOW. ARE WE THERE. YET SENATOR THE FLOOR IS YOURS. SO YOU CAN HEAR ME STATURE THANK YOU. I THINK ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE ABOUT NOT JUST THIS BILL. NINE FIFTEEN BUT OTHERS THAT ARE IN THE PIPELINE IS THAT. WE ARE LOOKING AT SOLVING HALF THE PROBLEM. AT THE RENTAL LEVEL WHETHER IT BE COMMERCIAL OR WHETHER IT BEING ALL WITH MOBILE HOMES OR RENTERS OF APARTMENTS. IF WE MAKE ALL THESE ARE IF WE IMPLEMENT ALL THESE PROTECTIONS FOR THE RANCHERS AND I THINK UNDER THESE VERY UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HOW BIG NINETEEN ARE THERE ARE STRONG ARGUMENTS THAT PEOPLE NEED SUPPORT. IT ONLY RESOLVES HALF THE ISSUE AND I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE EQUAL CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO BUDGET APPROPRIATIONS WHETHER IT BE AT THE STATE OR THE FEDERAL LEVEL LEAST AT THE STATE WITHIN OUR- IS THAT WE CREATE. FUNDING MECHANISMS THAT WE'RE HELP OUT THE PARK OWNERS WERE THE OWNERS OF THE- THE LAND WHAT WERE THE OTHER COMPLEX- BECAUSE IT SEEMS FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR TO ME. TO OFFER ALL THESE PROTECTIONS OVER HERE. WHILE IGNORING THE SIMILAR ON NEEDS OVER THERE ARE. I WOULD ASK THAT AS THIS MOVES FORWARD IS THERE ANY COMPATIBLE OR OR ACCOMPANYING LEGISLATION WITH THIS ARE COMING THROUGH THE PIPELINE EITHER BY THE ALTAR OR OTHERS THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR FUNDING MECHANISM THE STATE TO HELP THE OWNERS ARE WHERE THE LANDLORDS BECAUSE THE PARK OWNER STILL HAPPEN MORTGAGE TO START PART. AND I WOULD ASK THAT IF ANY OF THIS WERE TO MOVE FORWARD THAT IT BE DONE WITH THE OTHER HALF OF THE PROBLEM BEING ADDRESSED AS WELL BECAUSE LOOKING AT ONLY THE RANGERS ARE ONLY GETS A SO FAR. THE OTHER IS. THE TWO POINTS RAISED EARLIER BY THE REPRESENTED AS IS THAT BEING UTILITIES BEING BORN- BUYING AT THE OWNERS AND ALL SO ARE BEING HELD LIABLE FOR ANY IT CODE VIOLATIONS- SO I WOULD ASK THE AUTHOR. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO INCORPORATE INTO THIS LEGISLATION THROUGH A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT THAT THERE ARE BEING. LANGUAGE THAT IS DESIGNED TO PROTECT ARE THE PROPERTY ON THE CART OWNER. IN SUCH A WAY THAT UTILITIES CONTINUE TO BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE RENTER. AND WITH YOUR BE A LIABILITY WAIVER PROVISION THAT WOULD ALSO ALLOW FOR THEM TO RECEIVE SOME DEGREE OF PROTECTION I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU- YOU COMMENT ON THAT THANK YOU RIGHT WITH THAT- PERHAPS IN YOUR CLOTHES SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS. AGAIN I THINK JUST BEFORE WE DO THAT I MENTIONED THAT IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL IF THE LENDERS WOULD ALSO STEP UP- I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH CONTROL WE HAVE IS A STATE BUT THAT CERTAINLY AN ISSUE THIS IS ALSO NOT A PART OF THE- SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS LEAD POLLUTION BUT I DO THINK THAT. THE THIS HAS NOT THAT PASSED UP WE CAN GET CORPORATION THE LENDERS IN THAT REGARD AGAIN MOST OF THAT HIS ROLE. TO WELL BUT NOT PART OF THIS LED AS I MENTIONED WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER WE NEED TO ALL PART. WE NEED TO BREAK THESE THE BILL WAY TO WITH GET THROUGH THE BETTER OF PEOPLE AND TO I HOPE WE'LL SEE THAT AND WE. THE SENATE EARLY. LIKE THE THANK MADAM CHAIR AS THE CHAIR OF SELECT ON MOBILE AMEND YOUR HOME FOR THE SIX I WOULDN'T SAY I'M AN EXPERT BUT I WOULD SAY THAT I HAVE A LOT OF NEW AND I'VE LEARNED  LOT ABOUT MOBILE AND MANUFACTURED HOMES ONE THING THAT I HAVE DEFINITELY LEARNED IS THAT MOBILE HOMES ARE. TIMES DISADVANTAGED AND NOT TREATED THE SAME AS PEOPLE WHO OWN A STICK BUILT HOME AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT- WHEN I HEARD THE OPPOSITION SAY IT THIS WILL BE A PARK ON INCREASE A RENT AT ANY TIME THEY ALREADY. THIS IS A CALL WE GET HUNDREDS OF CALLS THAT WE GET UP AND DOWN THE STATE- ASKING ABOUT RENT AND RENT THAT HAS BEEN. RAISED WITH BASICALLY IN A **** NILLY MANNER- THIS I WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT THIS BILL IS ONLY DURING THE STATE OF EMERGENCY IN IS NOT AN INDEFINITE IMMUNITY. FOR RENTERS THIS IS A WAY TO HELP PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR JOB AND- AND WHEN YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT. WAT OUR VISIONS THAT YOU MAKE WHEN YOU'VE LOST CHURCH. YOU WANT TO PAY YOUR RENT BUT YOU PROBABLY ALSO WANT TO FEED YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY SO YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BUY FOOD FOR YOU PAY YOUR RENT. AGAIN THIS IS JUST A THE FOR ALL THIS IS NOT- GIVEN THIS THE REBELS. TO BE PAID. I AM ALWAYS WILLING TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE VIEW MA- TO THE ISSUES THAT SENATOR POOR JUST RAISED. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT'S PART OF THIS BILL THAT MAY TAKE A DIFFERENT BILL. BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY LOOK AT THAT. THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE OF THE FOLKS THAT ARE IN A MOBILE HOME. PARK ARE NOT EVICTED BECAUSE THEY WILL END UP HOMELESS AND THEY WILL HAVE A- PROBLEM THAN WE HAVE NOW. I HAVE NOT FOUND. OWNERS OF MOBILE HOME PARK IN MY SIX YEARS AS THE CHAIR. TO BE. REALLY HELPFUL TO THE RESIDENCE AND TO THE FOLKS THAT THEY COLLECT RENT FROM I'M SURE THERE ARE GOOD AND I'VE SEEN SOME. GOOD MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS BUT SO MANY MOBILE HOME HOME PARK OWNERS. DON'T LIVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DON'T LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY THEY OWN THESE AS A MONEY MAKING PROFIT. AND I FOUND THAT IT IS THE RENTER'S. FOR WHO ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT DAY TODAY ARE THE ONES WHO SUFFER. SO I WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK. WITH MAY AT ADDRESS CONCERNS BUT THIS IS ABOUT HELPING EVERYDAY PEOPLE AND MAKING SURE THEY HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE. WITHOUT STRICTLY ASKED ABOUT. THANK YOU. FOR THE CHAIR WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION HIS HER MOTION. SENATOR MARK THE MO IS TO PASS AS- TO THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEMBERS IF YOU WOULD PLEASE MAKE SURE YOUR MIKE SERRANO AND ADAM SECTOR WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL THIS IS FILE ITEM NUMBER THREE SB NINE FIFTEEN LEYVA- JACKSON HIGH ACCENT I DID ALSO HI IT ALSO I GONZALEZ HI GONZALEZ BY JONES OF. JAPAN'S NO MONNING AYE AYE MONNING AYE STERN HI STERN I BURKE. WHY CAL SKI. RIGHT. FIVE ONE THE ACCOUNT IS FIVE TWO FIVE FIVE ONE NO WE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU SENATOR LEYVA PRESENTATION MEMBERS AND NOW AT THIS POINT WE WILL GO ON TO FILE ITEM FOR WHICH IS S. IN NINE THIRTY NINE. A SIMPLE ALL WITH VERY LITTLE OPPOSITION. THE SIX JOKINGLY HI. UNDERSTAND THAT WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE SPEAKING IN SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION BUT WHAT WOULD A BILL BE FIRM SENATOR WARNER. WIENER EXCUSE ME IF WE COULD NOT HELPFUL. WELL THERE IS A CENTER WONDER THERE WIENER IS IT CAN BE PRONOUNCED EITHER WAY AND SPELL THE WAY IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN I HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO WINE FROM TIME TO TIME WELL. THAT WAS. ONE OF THE OTHER. HE EITHER WAY SENATOR WIENER. WE WILL HEAR FROM YOU NOW AND SB NINE THIRTY NINE AND- APPRECIATE YOUR- A COMING FORWARD WITH THE WITH THE YET ANOTHER INTERESTING AND THE CONFLICT IT DIDN'T. BLANK THE BLANK THE MEASURE I THINK WE ARE NO I GUESS THIS THIS SURVEY ANALYSIS IS ONLY TWENTY SIX PAGES LONG. WHICH IS CLOSE TO A RECORD I THINK THIRTY TWO IS THE RECORDS BUT I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE YOU'LL GET THERE AT SOME POINT. HERE THOUGH WE HAVE. THIS BILL YOU'RE GOING TO PRESENTED MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU'LL BE TAKING THE AMENDMENTS. THAT ARE REFERENCED ON PAGE EIGHT AND IN MARK UP ON PAGES TWENTY ONE THROUGH TWENTY SIX IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT MA'AM THANK YOU SIR AND WITH THAT- YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU MANAGER WILL HVE TO TRY HARDER TO GET UP TO THE THIRTY THREE PAGES AND SET THE RECORD. ON AND THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH US- AND I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE MY- LENSES ARE MY GLASSES HAVE JUST STARTED THE FOG NEVER GOOD ALL MORNING. IT'S A SMALL PRICE OF IT OVER REPUBLICAN- SO- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU IN YOUR STAFF FOR REALLY METICULOUS. CAME WITH US. IN THE AMENDMENTS. THEY'RE VERY. GOOD AMENDMENTS TO MAKE THE BILL BETTER MORE FOCUSED MORE NARROW AND TARGETED SO THANK YOU. I ALSO WANT TO THANK AND ACKNOWLEDGE MY PARTNER IN THIS BILL AND AUTHOR. SENATORS DOLLARS TO. WORKING HANDING OF. SOUTH ON. BUT I CALL DUE TO FIVE TEAM HI CAL FACE THE REAL PROSPECT OF A MASSIVE NUMBER OF SMALL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS NOT SHUTTING DOWN FOR THE SHELTER IN PLACE BUT PERMANENTLY CLOSING. A MAP X. EVENTS OF SMALL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS BECAUSE THEY'RE PART OF THIS BILL TO IN EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD IN CALIFORNIA. pOUR STATE PERMANENTLY. IT WOULD SEVERELY HAMPER OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER GIVEN HOW IMPORTANT THESE SMALL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS ARE FOR EMPLOYMENT IT WOULD DRAMATICALLY PARMER NEIGHBORHOOD WITH BOARDED UP STOREFRONTS. ANY WITH FARM ARNOTT'S VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE OUR NON PROFITS ARE PART OF OUR SOCIAL SAFETY NET. THIS BILL WILL ATTEMPT TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING- BYE BYE. IN A VERY I THINK A GOOD FAITH AWAY TRYING TO TRIAGE HORRIBLE SITUATION AND TO PREVENT THESE MASSIVE ACTIONS IT DOES SO BY FIRST PLACING A TEMPORARY MORATORIUM ON COMMERCIAL AND NONPROFIT EVICTIONS DURING THE STATE OF EMERGENCY. AND THEN REQUIRING GRADUAL REPAYMENT OF BACKGROUND OVER TWELVE MONTHS WHEN EMERGENCY ARMS BEARING KNOWLEDGES THAT ONE PARTICULAR SECTOR THE HOSPITALITY SECTOR RESTAURANTS BARS CAFE. PLACES OF ENTERTAINMENT ARE GOING TO BE PARTICULARLY HARD HIT. NOT ONLY WILL THEY BE CLOSING DOWN OR ARE THEY SHUT DOWN. DURING THIS ORDER IN PLACE NOT ONLY ARE THEY GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH BACKGROUND. BUT WHEN THEY OPEN THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE MANDATING THAT THEY DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THEIR CAPACITY BY 25% 50% MAYBE EVEN GUIDELINES. MANDATORY CHOPPING IN HALF OR THEREABOUTS OF SOMEONE'S BUSINESS. YET THESE RESTAURANTS BARS CAFES. ARE EXPECTED TO TRUST FRANKLY SUCK IT UP AND MAGICALLY COME UP WITH THE HIGH RENT CONTAINED IN THEIR LEASE THAT WAS NEGOTIATED IN PRE CO THAT. CIRCUMSTANCES THE RESTAURANT THAT NEGOTIATED A LEASE BASED ON TWENTY TABLES AND IS NOW TO HOLD FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE YOU CAN ONLY FILL EIGHTY. IS SOMEHOW EXPECTED. TO COMPLY WITH THAT LEASE. THAT'S NOT REALITY. SB NINE THIRTY NINE THEREFORE CREATES INCENTIVES FOR COMMERCIAL LANDLORDS TO RENEGOTIATE THE RENT WITH THEIR ATTENDANCE SO THESE BUSINESSES CAN THRIVE. BASED ON THE GOVERNMENT RAN MANDATED REDUCTION. IT DOES SO BY GIVING TENANTS IN AGAIN RESTAURANTS BARS CAFES PLACE OF ENTERTAINMENT THAT EXPERIENCE EITHER A 40% DROP IN REVENUE OR AT LEAST A 25% CAPACITY REDUCTION TO TRIGGER A RENEGOTIATION PERIOD WHICH HOPEFULLYWILL SUCCEED IF IT DOESN'T SUCCEED IT WILL GIVE THE BUSINESS THE OPPORTUNITY TO TERMINATE THE LEASE. TO BE CLEAR THE PURPOSE OF THIS LEASE TERMINATION PROVISION IS NOT FOR LEASES TO BE TERMINATED. IT'S TO PROVIDE SPACE AN INCENTIVE TO ACTUALLY GET THE RENEGOTIATION BUT WE KNOW THAT OVERWHELMINGLY THESE BUSINESSES DON'T WANT TO CLOSE DOWN THIS IS THEIR LIFE'S WORK THEY WANT TO FIND A WAY. TO SURVIVE. I ALSO WANT TO BE CLEAR WE'RE NOT STEREOTYPING OR DEMONIZING ABROAD BRUSHING COMMERCIAL LANDLORDS. MANY COMMERCIAL LANDLORDS ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING RIGHT NOW. THEY'RE WORKING WITH THE RENTERS THEY'RE WAVING BACKGROUND THERE RESTRUCTURING AND RENEGOTIATING LEASES I WANT TO COMMEND THOSE LAND WITH THESE IT. TO GET IT WHO UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S NOT IN ANYONE'S INTEREST TO HAVE WE CAN SEE FOR THE LANDMARK IT'S NO REVENUE. TO PAY THEIR LOANS OFF. BUT SADLY. ON THE OTHER HAND ALL TOO MANY COMMERCIAL LANDLORDS ARE REFUSING TO RENEGOTIATE. ARE INSISTING THAT THE PRE CODED UNREALISTIC RANDY TATE. ARE IN VOTING LEASE RENT ESCALATORS TRYING TO RAISE THE RENT. OR IMPOSING LATE PENALTIES LATE FEES ON BACKGROUND THAT IS HAPPENING ALL OVER THE STATE WE'RE SENSITIVE TO THE NEEDS OF PROPERTY OWNERS IN TERMS OF THEIR LOAN OBLIGATIONS. IT'S A COMPLICATED ISSUE WE DON'T WANT THESE PROPERTY OWNERS TO THE FALL ON THEIR LOANS BUT WE ALSO NEED TO BE CLEAR THESE LAND THOSE ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO COLLECT THE FREE COVERED RENTS FROM THESE RESTAURANTS BARS AND CAFES THAT IS NOT REALITY. THE CHOICE IS IN BETWEEN FULL RENT AND REDUCE CRIME THE CHOICE IS BETWEEN REDUCE CRIME I KNOW RENT BECAUSE THE BUSINESS HAS SHUT DOWN AND POTENTIALLY THE OWNER HAS HAD TO DECLARE PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY. THAT IS NOT GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA. MASS BANKRUPTCIES ENCLOSURES AND VACANCIES SB NINE THIRTY NINE IS A REASONABLE A REASONABLE APPROACH. TO HELP AVOID MASS CLOSURES OF THESE BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS. I WANT TO BE CANDID IS S. NINE THIRTY NINE PERFECT NO. IS IT DOESN'T NEED MORE WORK IT DOES AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO THAT WORK WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH OPPONENTS OF THE BILL AND I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR DIALOGUING WITH US. NEXT WEEK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A NUMBER A MEETING SCHEDULED THAT CENTER GONZALEZ AND I ARE GONNA BE TAKING WITH THE OPPONENTS TO TRY TO COME UP WITH HIS COMMON AS POSSIBLE. WE WANT TO GET TO A POINT. WHERE WE HAVE A BILL THAT WE EVERYONE CAN RALLY AROUND TO SAVE. OUR SMALL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS. KOBE BILLS ARE NOT THE SAME AS REGULAR BILLS WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE SIX MONTHS. BEFORE SESSION TO WORK ON THE BILL AND THREE MONTHS FROM INTRODUCTION TO COMMITTEE. TO METHODICALLY WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS. THIS PANDEMIC CAME UP FAST. EVERYTHING IS FAST HERE AND SO THIS IS NORMALLY WE WOULD HAVE DONE EVEN MORE WORK BEFORE COMMITTEE. BUT BECAUSE F THE NATURE OF THAT TO SPEND THAT MAKE THAT HASN'T HAPPENED THE LEADERSHIP IS PROPOSING A RENTER RELIEF. MEASURE WHICH IS VERY PROMISING. IT'S NOT A PRINT YET NOR WHAT I EXPECTED TO BE A FRIEND CAUSE WE'RE IN AN EMERGENCY EVERYTHING IS MOVING FAST. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT KOBE BILLS IT'S NOT ALWAYS IN THE SAME PLACE AS THE LAST YEAR OR THE YEAR BEFORE. AND SO WE'RE JUST ASKING FOR THE SPACE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS. AND I MEANT. THE WORK SETTING. IN MAKING. BUT THE LEASE READING. PROVISION ONLY APPLIES TO HOSPITALITY. THERE WAS CONFUSION BASED ON AMBIGUITY IN THE LANGUAGE AND THE COMMITTEE HAS WORKED WITH US. TO REALLY TIGHTEN UP WE AVE A DEFINITION OF SMALL BUSINESS BASED ON FEDERAL LAW AND THE P. P. P. PROGRAM WHICH IS UP TO FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES SOME HAVE QUESTIONED WHETHER IT SHOULD BE LOWER- WE'RE OPEN TO THAT CONVERSATION THERE'S NOTHING BIBLICAL ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED. AND IF IT NEEDS TO BE LOWER- WE WILL DEFINITELY HAVE A CONVERSATION WERE NOT OPPOSED. TO THAT- CLARIFICATIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE OBJECTIONS ARE ONLY BASED ON COVERT FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES- AND CLARIFYING THAT THE LENGTH OF THE EVICTION PROTECTIONS IN THE OTHER PART OF THE BILL. CONSISTENT WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ROOM EXPIRING NINETY DAYS AFTER THE END OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY. IN ADDITION WE WILL BE PURSUING AMENDMENTS AND APPROPRIATIONS- TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THE TWELVE PREPAYMENT YOU CAN'T WAIT TILL THE THREE SIXTY. THE IT ALL OFF WILL HAVE TO BE GRAY. WE WANT TO TREAT THE LAWN IT'S FAIRLY. SOMEONE WANT TO CLARIFY THAT NEW LEASES BETTER BEING ENTERED INTO OF COURSE ARE NOT COVERED BY THIS BILL PEOPLE HAVE EYES WIDE OPEN. SO COLLEAGUES I'M ASKING YOU TODAY TO GIVE US THE SPACE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BILL. WE KNOW THAT THIS BILL HAS AN URGENCY COSTS IN IS A TWO THIRDS VOTE ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE WE KNOW WE HAVE WORK TO DO.

IS THAT CORRECT ARE YOU ON THESE CALLS ON THE PHONE. YES MEDICARE HEART YET SO- PLEASE PROCEED YOU WILL HAVE A TOTAL OF THREE MINUTES AND FORTY SECONDS- YOU CAN DIVIDE IT ANY WAY YOU WISH. BUT YOU MAY GO AHEAD AND START AND THE I WILL BE KEEPING THAT TIME. SO PLEASE GO AHEAD. I'M SURE MEMBERS THE MORNING MY NAME IS ROB LAPS WE PRESENT A CALIFORNIA BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE AND JOINING ME TODAY TO STRONGLY OPPOSE SB NINE THIRTY NINE. DURING THIS CRISIS WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS EMERGENCY ORDINANCES AND RUN CAPS ADDICTIONS. AND OTHER ISSUES AND MULTI FAMILY AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES SECTORS. YOU KNOW WE SUPPORT THESE PUBLIC POLICY MATTERS AND WE CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO ENSURE THEY WORK SUCCESSFULLY FOR PROPERTY OWNERS AND FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES. BUT DURING THIS INCREDIBLY STRESSFUL TIME WE FOCUSED ON THE CHALLENGE THAT A CRISIS IN ONE OR MORE SECTORS OF OUR ECONOMY DUE TO THIS PANDEMIC COULD NOT AND SHOULD NOT BE A CATALYST FOR PUBLIC POLICIES THAT CREATE IN CASCADE A CRISIS. IN OTHER SECTORS SUCH AS HOUSING AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTY BUT WE FACE SAID AGAIN TODAY IN SB NINE THIRTY NOT. SO MADAM CHAIR AT THE GOAL IS TO HELP RESTAURANTS THE STATE SHOULD PRIORITIZE FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND HELP SUPPORT RESTAURANT. NOT UNFAIRLY SHOULD TO CRISIS TO PROPERTY OWNERS WHICH WILL IN TURN SHOULD THE CRISIS TO BANKS AND THEN TO SHAREHOLDERS. WHICH IN REALITY OR MANY OF THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO ARE TRYING TO HELP. AND IT IS CLEAR THAT THIS BILL IS SIGNIFICANT CONSTITUTIONAL PROBLEMS WE HOPE THAT THEY SHOULD BE CLEAR AND PERSUASIVE ENOUGH TO VOTE NO ON THE MEASURE. IF NOT WE WILL BE PURSUING THESE ISSUES IN THE COURTS AS NEEDED. I KNOW AMENDMENTS ARE BEING DISCUSSED WE WILL LOOK AT THESE UNDER CONSIDERATION THAT THEY DO NOT CASCADE A WHOLE NEW CRISIS. AND OTHER SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY. SB NINE THIRTY NINE CANNOT SEND THE WRONG MESSAGE. FOR THE FUTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENT WE NEED TO GROW OUT OF THIS RECESSION. AND TO BE ABLE TO RETURN WORKERS BACK TO THEIR JOBS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER LAPSLEY AND THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE THE COURTS IF. AT SOME POINT THERE THERE'S A CONCERN ABOUT THE LEGITIMACY OF ANY MEASURE THAT PASSES LEGISLATURE. WE ARE DELIGHTED TO OPEN UP THE COURTS FOR THAT RESOLUTION SHOULD IT BE APPROPRIATE SO. WITH THAT- MID SHIP HERE ON THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SENATORS HERE AND SHAPIRO WITH BY MY CALIFORNIA. STANGEL IMPACT OF THIS BILL ON PRIVATE CONTRACTORS NOT APPROPRIATE OR REASONABLE AND THE BILL IS THERE FOR CON ON CONSTITUTIONAL. WE THEREFORE SUGGEST THE FOLLOWING ONE FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS ARGUES THAT IF YOU ARE GOING TO FOR RENT THE PORTION OF RENT TO BE DEFERRED SHOULD BE PRO RATED BASED ON THE PROPORTION OF LOTS OF REVENUE. ABSOLUTE TENANTS REVENUE IS DOWN 40% BUT ONLY DID YOU OTHERWISE GIVE THEY WOULD FALL TO THE TENANT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE LANDLORD. IF TENANTS DO NOT PAY THE DEFERRED WRITTEN ON TIME UNDER THEIR NEW SCHEDULE AND ALL LATE FEES AND INTEREST CHARGES SHOULD BE REINSTATED. THIS WOULD INCENTIVIZE TENANTS TO PERFORM THEIR PART OF THE DEAL AND DOES NOT ADD ANY BURDEN TO THEM IF THEY PERFORM. THREE REQUIREMENT THAT LAMBERT'S HAVE TO SEND NOTICE ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK. AND THE DAY. BURDENSOME IT WILL COST. OF DOLLARS. INSTEAD THIS LED. SHOULD ONLY REQUIRE A DISCO IN ANY NOTICE THAT THREATENS FORFEITURE OF THE LEAST FOR MONETARY DEFAULT. TO THE INFORMATION GETS TO THE TENANT WHEN IT MATTERS. FINALLY SECTION TWO OF THE BILL IS UNNECESSARY AND SHOULD BE DROPPED IN ITS ENTIRETY. SECTION ONE COVERS ALL TENANTS AND RESTAURANT SHOULD NOT GET A BETTER DEAL. IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO COUNSEL LEASES AND GUARANTEES TO SERVE THE STATED PURPOSES OF THE BILL. IF THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL THAT JUSTIFIES CUTTING INTO CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT JUST TO KEEP THEM. IN THEIR SPACES AND GIVING SOME TENANTS THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE THEIR LEASES TURNS OUT ON ITS HEAD. AND EXCUSING GUARANTORS WHO ALWAYS RAN THE RISK OF THE TENET GOING OUT OF BUSINESS IF I'M CALLED FOR I REASONABLE AND INAPPROPRIATE. WE ARE EARNING NO VOTE ON THE NINE THIRTY NINE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL NARROW STE GO TO. THE PHONE SING. OTHER OTHER WOULD. ON OPPOSITION HERE IN FORTY TWO OR THREE. SEEING NON AND NO ONE'S IN ROOM TWENTY FORTY. WE WILL GO TO THE PHONES.

I'M BEING CONSTITUTIONALLY CHALLENGED HERE AND I'D WANT TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND ON THE DEFINITIONS IT SEEMS AS THOUGH IN SECTION. A HIGH IT'S DONE SIX OR SECTION ONE IN. HER STARTING A PARAGRAPH SIX IT STARTS ABOUT ELIGIBILITY YOU'VE GOT 20% DECLINE IN YOUR SALES YOU COULDN'T OPEN BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC IN AND IT SAYS FIFTEEN PERCENT. DECLINE IN YOUR CAPACITY DUE TO A PUBLIC. HEALTH ORDER AN OFFICIAL PUBLIC HEALTH- THEN YOU DROP IN THIS SECTION TO AND IT LOOKS AS THOUGH IT'S GETTING MORE GENEROUS ON ELIGIBILITY OF RESTAURANT IT SAYS YOU HAVE A TWENTY HE GETS INTO THE THIRD. COMPOUND TWENTY FIVE FIRST US OF A CAPACITY TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH MINISTER. IT WHY THE DIFFERENCE I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENCE AND THEN I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION I BUT WHAT IT'S THANK YOU ARE TO THE CHAIR. PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION BECAUSE THESE ARE TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT- SECTIONS AT THAT ADDRESS DIFFERENT SOME OVERLAPPING DIFFERENT ISSUES ON SECTION TWO WITH THE 25% DROPPING CAPACITY OR FORTY PERCENT. REDUCTION IN REVENUE IS NOT MORE GENEROUS IT'S LAST TIME YES IT'S MUCH MORE RESTRICTIVE AND THE REASON WE WENT THERE IS SECTION SECTION ONE APPLIES TO EVERYONE BUSINESSES NONPROFITS. IT'S SIMPLY A TEMPORARY PAUSE IN ELECTIONS AND YOU REPAY ALL YOUR ROUNDS PLACE TO EVERYONE AND SO IT IS MORE IS PROPER SECTION TO WHICH OF COURSE PLANTLIFE ACOSTA TALLY IS WE ARE KNOWLEDGE IS A MUCH MORE. AGGRESSIVE APPROACH AS A RESULT WE MAKE YOU HAVE TO BE IN MORE EXTREME TRAITS START THAT BRUSHES OFFER THIS. BETWEEN THE TWO WE WHAT WE'RE BEING MORE GENEROUS WITH SECTION ONE THE BLIND A MORATORIUM. ON ME MUCH MORE RESTRICTIVE IN WHO CAN QUALIFY FOR THE RENEGOTIATION POTENTIAL LEASE TERMINATION BECAUSE IT IS A MORE AGGRESSIVE APPROACH I WAS THE RATIONALE. SO I GUESS WITH THE AS I UNDERSTAND ARE AT A PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS WE'VE GOT IS WE LOOK IN THE AUDIENCE HERE WE HAVE A LOT TO SIGN THIS IS A SIX. PART WHAT IS THIS IS. AFFECTED BY 15% OF CAPACITY WITH THE PUBLIC- YEAH THE GIRL AT THE PUBLIC. HEALTH ORDER I DO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO THAT WOULD BE THE GOAL THE GOAL. ON SECTION ONE THE- EVICTION MORATORIUM THE GOAL IS TO BE BROAD. BECAUSE WE WANT TO HAVE STABILITY SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THESE OBJECTIONS AND THEN PEOPLE PAY BACK THE RENT. GOAL IN SEARCH TO. BE MUCH MORE RESTRICTIVE I IN TERMS OF THE MOST IMPACTED BUSINESSES SO WE'VE INTENTIONALLY BEEN MORE- BROADER IN SECTION ONE. BECAUSE IT IS A LESS AGGRESSIVE POLICY INTERVENTION IT'S SIMPLY A DELAY IN PAYING THE BUT THE RENT WILL BE PAID BACK- AND SO THAT THAT'S WHY. WE ARE WE'RE INTENT THE BROADER THAT I DON'T WANT HIM IN THE COMMITTEE BEFORE THE AMENDMENTS. THE COURSE OF ACTION OF MORE TRANSLATE TO THERE WAS NO REQUIREMENT FOR A DROP IN REVENUE. FOR AND I OUR CAPACITY WE TOOK THAT AS A COMMITTEE A I'M AND WE APPROPRIATE AS- BUT BUT I'M I'M NOT. BUT THIS. TIME THE TO BE MORE CONFIDENT CONTRA. SOME CHAIR IF I LOOK AT FOR OF BLADE BETTER EXCELLENCE BEFORE ONE AGAIN FROM WHOEVER WROTE TO STAFF REPORT AND IN SPEND TEACHES US THAT THE STATE CAN IMPAIR ONTRACTS BUT THEY HAVE TO BE REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE. FIFTY RESULT IF EVERYBODY'S COLLUDED IN IN THE CATCH WORSE THAT. WHERE IS THAT LIMITATION ON THE IMPAIRMENT OF CONTRACTS BECAUSE I AGAIN I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE IS THE BUSINESS THAT HASN'T HAD PUBLIC HEALTH WATER. SO AND WE AND AGAIN THAT'S THE REASON FOR THE- FOR THE DISTINCTION SECTION TO. THIS LIMITED TO THE HOSPITALITY AND IS A MORE AGGRESSIVE INTERVENTION WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR LEASE TERMINATION. WE TOOK A HIGH SENATE FOR THE ADDICTION MORATORIUM BECAUSE IT IS A LESS AGGRESSIVE INTERVENTION- I THINK IT WOULD BE A MUCH WEAKER CASE FOR IMPAIRMENT CONTRACT. AND WE HAVE ALL ACROSS THE STATE. WE HAVE EXISTING COMMERCIAL MORATORIUM. NORTH KOREA IN OUT IN SAN FRANCISCO'S FOR THAT DO NOT REQUIRE ANY DROP IN BUSINESS THEY SIMPLY PUT A MORATORIUM IN PLACE ONE RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL. TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO AND SO WE'RE ACTUALLY BEING MORE RESTRICTIVE IN SOME WAYS AND IS LOCAL MORE TORIA THAT ARE ALREADY BEING FORCED RIGHT NOW. I AM SURE ONE MORE QUESTION AND JUST IT IT SEEMS THAT THE- ELEMENT HERE IS THE COMMERCIAL BANKS TO HOLD THE PAPER. ARE YOU KNOW ON THAT AND FUND THE MANAGER OF THE- OLD ORDER OWNER OF THE BUILDING AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THEY- ARE NOT. FOR CLOSURES WHICH IS WHAT EVERYBODY USES AT THE LANGUAGE ONCE YOU GO INTO THE OLD. A ANY PARTIAL PAYMENT IS THE TEAM AS A CURE YOU CAN YOU CAN YOU. DON'T LET AP SHOW ME PAYMENT. NUMBER TAKE THE THERE'S AN ONLINE FIRST TO REAL HAVE THESE PAR PAY HEARD SOMEBODY OPPOSITE SAYING WE WOULD LIKE TAKES WHO PEOPLE TO DO THE THAT THEY OF YOUR BILL WITHOUT FORTY PER PLAYED 40% THAT'S IN HERE AT ALL AND THERE'S NO DISCUSSION OF DEAL ADDRESSING THAT DEFAULT AND ACCEPTING PARTIAL PAYMENTS WITH THE COMMERCIAL BANKS AS PART OF THE THREE WAY THAT'S- IT'S A TWO WAY NAY SO IN TERMS OF THE LOANS IT. IS CHALLENGING BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW AND I'M HAPPY TO FOR CONVERSATION WITH YOU BECAUSE I'M THIS IS YOUR SISTER AROUND SENATE YOU'RE A YOU'RE YOU'RE DEFINITELY AN EXPERT HERE AND- WE- IT IS MUCH MORE LIMITED JURISTIC UNDER BORROWER RELATIONSHIP AND SO WE HAVE A CHALLENGE WITH THIS PANDEMIC BUT THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT ARE FEDERAL THERE'S SOME SORT OF STATE THERE'S SOMETHING SORT OF LOCAL AND SOMETIMES PART. ENTER BLOCK THAT. WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK ON WAYS TO ADDRESS- THE LENDER- ISSUE AND IN TERMS OF PARTIAL PAYMENTS WE TRY NOT TO BE MICROMANAGING ABOUT HOW THINGS GO RENEGOTIATED. AND SUPPORT YOU KNOW- TO SAY WHAT THE RENT SHOULD BE OR WHAT WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO BE. BROAD AND JUST TO MAKE SURE WE'RE BRINGING PEOPLE TO THE TABLE SO THAT'S THE- THAT'S THE TRUTH. THANK THANK YOU SIR ASKING THE- RON SO. YEAH THIS IS A BIT IT BROUGHT UP A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS AND I TALKED TO. OF BOTH SMALL BUSINESSES SMALL LANDLORDS AS WELL AS- LARGE- LARGE LAND OWNERS AND- SAUCE I WAS THINKING ABOUT HOW. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL HERE OF OUR OUR APPROACH YOU KNOW IN THE RESIDENTIAL. THERE'S A GREATER IMBALANCE BECAUSE- THE SUPPLY IS SO SMALL AND THE DEMAND IS SO MASSIVE. SO ARMED MEN A STATE IS. REALLY TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BRING A LITTLE MORE BALANCED TO AND I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO DO THE SAME THING HERE. THIS BUSINESS SMALLERAND SMALLER BIGELOW TRYING TO GET THEM TO THE POINT OF TAKING DOING SERIOUS NEGOTIATIONS SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO GET INTO THE WEEDS OF IT AND TRY TO- FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION THAT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR EVERYBODY ALL THE TIME TIME- NO YOU WANT TO WE DO WANT TO PROTECT THE SMALL COMMERCIAL TEN. TEN AND UP AND I AGREE WITH OF PROTECTING SMALL BUSINESSES WE'VE WE'VE HEARD THAT MANY MANY TIMES IN MY DISTRICT THERE'S- THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF SMALL BUSINESSES SMALL RESTAURANTS- NEIGHBORHOOD SHOPS. I BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT HOW WE MAKE SURE THAT THE LARGER COMMERCIAL TENANTS- DON'T OF WITH RESOURCES THAT THEY DON'T AVOID PAIN RENDON THEY DON'T SLIP THROUGH HERE SO I WE DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE ARE LARGE RETAILERS WHO ARE- FLOURISHING. I KNOW THAT'S OF. THAT'S THAT'S A THAT'S THE KIND OF BUSINESS THAT I DON'T THINK SHOULD SLIP THROUGH HERE SO. WITH BAD ARE A- A NEW AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS IS HOW DO WE- JUST SOME IDEAS IN TERMS OF- WHO. COULD BE OR SHOULD BE EXCLUDED OR NOT GIVING THAT KIND OF PROTECTION- YOU INCLUDE PUBLICLY TRADED TENANTS- MAYBE- EXPANDING TO COVER TENANTS THAT ARE FROM MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES AN AFFILIATE. OF I KNOW YOU HAVE FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES AS THE AS THE DEFINITION OF SMALL BUSINESS. I DON'T SEE FIVE AND AS A SMALL BUSINESS- AND I WOULD REALLY URGE A MUCH MUCH SMALLER NUMBER BECAUSE THAT'S WERE REALLY TRYING TO DEFEND THE TIME AND PROTECT. OF THE TEND TO HAVE OF EXCLUDE THOSE WHO HAVE MORE THAN THREE LOCATIONS SO I THINK THOSE KINDS OF THINGS- TO MAKE SURE AGAIN THAT IT'S REALLY THE SMALL BUSINESS AND NOT A LARGER BUSINESS. UP SOME. I ANOTHER CAR HERE I'D LIKE TALK ABOUT IT IS. THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE LOCAL CITIES AND ORDINANCES AND THE STATE COULD YOU DESCRIBE IF THERE'S A CONFLICT OR THE SO MANY OF THEM HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THAT YOUR SMALL BUSINESS EDITOR THE CHAIR- BILLS CHAIR PLACED SO- IN TERMS OF THE DEFINITIONS WELL BUSINESS AS I MENTIONED A BEGINNING AND I IN OUR CONVERSATION FOR- REPUBLIC FIVE HUNDRED I BELIEVE BECAUSE- YEAH. THROUGH THE COMMITTEE THAT'S ABOUT DEFINITE BUSINESS NOTHING MAGICAL ABOUT THAT NUMBER WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK THROUGH. THOSE OF ISSUES THE BILL WAS REQUIRED TO THE OWNER OF COURSE AT BE PUBLICLY TRADED FEWER THAN FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES- AND THOMAS PILED IN CALIFORNIA- I REMEMBER THAT WAS AN AMENDMENT IT'S NOT WE TALKED ABOUT IT AND WE THINK IT SHOULD. NOT LOOK FOR CERTAIN NATIONAL. FINISHED AND MORE TOWARD THERE'S IN THIS BILL THAT FOR THANKS LOCAL ORDINANCES ARE EXACT ORDERS THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED- AND I TOOK WE WOULDN'T DO THAT IF THE CITY WANTS TO GO BEYOND OF COURSE WE WANT ALSO AVOID AT THIS CONFLICT AND SO IT'S SOMETHING WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT- BUT I KNOW THE TYPICALLY WE THOUGHT- PREEMPTS LOCAL EGULATIONS ARE. BY THE TIME BY THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THAT ONE I READ- AND WE'LL TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THAT. FINALLY ONE THING I DIDN'T WE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT. I KNOW THAT A LOT OF THE SUPPORTERS- MENTION. THEIR EMPLOYEES GETTING EMPLOYEES BACK TO WORK THE OPPOSITION MENTIONS EMPLOYEES AS- THE ONES WHO GOING TO BE HEARD- WE SHOULD CONSIDER. WHAT IS IT THAT WILL BE DONE FOR EMPLOYEES- WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF ORDINANCES PASSED IN THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY AREA. ABOUT RECALL AND MAKING SURE THAT AS BUSINESSES- BEGIN TO. GET BUSINESS AGAIN. THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE TO RECALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE WORKING FOR THEM BEFORE- WAY TO TALK ABOUT. RIGHT CAN A- THE TRICKLED THAT SOMEHOW EMPLOYEES JUST BENEFIT. IF THEIR EMPLOYERS BENEFIT- SO. JUST PUTTING THAT FOR CONSIDERATION I THINK THERE IS NOT THANK YOU SENATOR RUSS SO SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- PHASE CENTER FOR ENGAGING HERE AND I KNOW WE'VE HAD A FEW CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS. RUSSELL THIS YOU KNOW THIS CRISIS THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE TRYING TO WRESTLE WITH- YOU KNOW IT HIT IT HIT TENANTS INCREDIBLY HARD AND I AM WORRIED ABOUT THE FUTURE WOULD WHERE I GO HOME THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY AND I CAN'T. HEATED THE LITTLE TALK ARENA THAT I'VE BEEN GOING TO FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS OR- YOU KNOW THAT THE SMALL HOLE IN THE WALL. PLACE TO DRINK A BEER FOR THOSE THINGS THAT SORT OF MAKE OUR CULTURE SO SPECIAL. I AM WORRIED ABOUT AS LOSING THEM INTO SEEING A FUTURE RETAIL FRANKLY THAT'S THAT'S MUCH MORE CORPORATE AND- AND REALLY IS AN OF THE COMMUNITY GOING FORWARD SO WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT THE BILL OF THE ADDED- BUT I ALSO WANT TO BUT THE TO CRISIS. IN SOMETHING WITH THE IT'S NOT THE LANDLORD'S FAULT EITHER BENNETT'S FRANKLY EVEN OTHER LENDERS FAULT- THIS SOMETHING THAT NO ONE PREDICTED SO. I'M WRESTLING WITH THE MECHANICS IN SECTION TWO AND I KNOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS AND I APPRECIATE SOME OF THE STATEMENTS YOU'VE ALREADY MADE IN TERMS YOUR WILLINGNESS TO CERTAINLY WORK ON SIZE- SURE SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF MY COLLEAGUE ABOUT THE SIZE BUT- BUT MY FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE RIGHT. NOW WITH CAN EXES THIS THE UNILATERAL RECISION. ABILITY AND JUST THE PRESIDENT THAT THAT KIND OF- THAT THAT KIND OF LAW WOULD HAVE- AYE AYE. WITH DUE RESPECT I DO. DISAGREE WITH THE NOTION THAT THIS SHOULD BE SORTED OUT THE COURTS IF YOUR GOAL IS TO GET URGENT RELIEF HERE- AND YOU PUT A TWO THIRDS ON THIS WHICH I REALLY RESPECT YOU PUT IN THAT. HURDLE IN FRONT OF YOURSELF- IT WAS THE LEAD MISSY OF THE AGENCY- WE CAN'T THEN GET THIS WRAPPED UP IN LITIGATION LET THE COURTS SORTED OUT- THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY GOING TO DELIVER RELIEF TO ANYBODY. I SAW THE ARGUMENT ABOUT APPROPRIATE AND REASONABLE IN THE TAILORING IN THE ANALYSIS I STILL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER WOULD PASS CONSTITUTIONAL MUSTER AND EXACTLY WHAT PRESIDENT- WE'D BE. HEARING THIS UNDER- BUT I WONDERED I MEAN HAVE YOU TAKEN A- I THINK JUST DID A DIFFERENT-MECHANISM HAVE YOU STARTED THINKING ABOUT ALTERNATIVE MECHANISMS OTHER THAN. THIS SORT OF UNILATERAL RECISION RIGHT I KNOW I'D FLOATED WITH YOU THE IDEA OF. A BAD FAITH CONTINGENCY IF THEY WENT INTO A RENEGOTIATION BUT THEN. THE LANDLORD WAS AN ACTING IN IN GOOD FAITH THAT THEN THAT WOULD GIVE A RIGHT TO UNILATERAL RECISION OR SOME OTHER TRIGGERS I RECOGNIZE THAT SOME OF THIS IS. ADMINISTRATIVELY DIFFICULT BUT I. WANTED TO SEE SORT OF. YOUR THOUGHT ON ON BAD FAITH TRIGGER CONCEPT. OR POTENTIALLY SOME OTHER MECHANISM OTHER THAN UNILATERAL RECISION SO GIVE ME A CHANCE THANK YOU. PERHAPS IT YOU'RE IN YOUR CLOTHES. THE MENTION THAT AS WELL. WE DO HAVE SENATOR MOPPING UP THE QUESTION. OF MORE QUESTIONS. WELL IN YOUR CLOTHES IN IT WOULD ADDRESS AT THE HIT CENTER THAT CAN ANSWER MY QUESTION WELL I WILL CLOSE OKAY. OKAY IS IT UNDER YOUR NAME I'M SORRY SAID ON THE SAME ISSUE YEAH I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR FEEDBACK ON THAT BUT- AT WHAT DON'T YOU GO AHEAD SENATOR WE KNOW LISTEN. I WASN'T AWARE THAT YOU HAD A QUESTION SO WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD AND ANSWER ONE ORDERED REFRESHER. IN TERMS OF- THE BAD FAITH IDEA THAT WOULD ONLY APPLY IF THE LANDLORD WAS NOT NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH. SO I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT. THE QUESTION IS UNITED DISCUSSES. HOW DO YOU WRITE THAT IN A WAY THAT'S OF FORCIBLE BECAUSE BAD FAITH GOOD FAITH IS SO SUBJECTIVE. AND THE ONLY WAY THAT I CAN THINK OF ENFORCING NINE. IS THROUGH LITIGATION AND A SENSOR JURY DECIDING WHAT COULD PICK THAT FAITH. THAT PRESIDENT AND COURTS FOR YEARS HE'S A SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT GOING TO HIRE A LAWYER THIS IS GONNA. CLOSE UPS. SO WHAT I EXPRESSED EVEN OFFERS AGAIN F WE CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO MAKE THAT WRITEABLE IMPLEMENTABLE ENFORCEABLE. THAT'S THAT'S AWESOME I JUST WANT TO TALK MY HEAD. I CAN FIGURE THAT OUT BUT WE WILL GIVE THEM MORE THOUGHT. THE OTHER MODEL. ON THE AND I'VE EXPRESSED SAYS TO THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE PEOPLE AND SOME PEOPLE HAVE COME FORWARD IDEAS ALREADY AND I APPRECIATE THAT. THERE'S NOTHING MAGICAL OBSERVE LOCAL. ABOUT THIS EXACT STRUCTURE WE HAVE AN OPEN MIND TO CONSIDERING OTHER APPROACHES. OTHER IDEAS TO GET TO THE GOAL OF STABILIZING BY THESE BUSINESSES SO YES WE ARE ABSOLUTELY WILLING TO HAVE A BROAD BASED DIALOGUE. AND O THE LAST QUESTION WE JUST. THE COMPREHENSIVE NATURE THE SOLUTION I THINK WE ALSO TALK TO IN YOUR YOUR CO AUTHOR MENTION IT TO THE NEED FOR SOME KIND OF RENT RELIEF FOR SOME OTHER STRUCTURE SOME COROLLARY STRUCTURED ACTUALLY MAKE THIS WORK. I'M ON THE MORTGAGE SIDE OF THINGS. DO YOU SEE ANY- DAYLIGHT ARE THERE THINGS WE CAN POINT TO HEAR I MEAN. IS THERE A POSSIBILITY THERE SENATE PACKAGE LOOKS AT THESE ISSUES I KEEP HEARING FEDERALLY BECAUSE THERE ARE NO FEDERALLY BACKED. COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES THAT. IT'S REALLY IT'S A VERY NARROW HOPE RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF GETTING SOME KIND OF FEDERAL RELIEF ON THIS FRONT BUT JUST CURIOUS HOW THIS COMING SEASONS OF DEVELOP THE RESTAURANTS HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING AT THE FEDERAL. LEVEL FOR A RIDE. THE HOUSE. FOR SMALL BUSINESS I. KNOW I IT'S EVERYONE YES THAT WILL. HAVE I'M SURE THERE A LOT OF IN THIS THAT ARE. FOR THAT. ONE BUT YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE GREAT I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT WILL HAPPEN. IN TERMS OF THE SENATE PACKAGE RIGHT NOW THE LEADERSHIP IN CENTER BRADFORD. HAVE PROPOSED A RESIDENTIAL. RENTER BOB RED FORGIVENESS WITH THE TAX CREDIT PAYMENT- I'M NOT TRANSLATE THAT TO COMMERCIAL BUT AGAIN. WE'RE OPEN TO ALL OF THIS DISCUSS. THANK YOU FOR THAT- COM AND YOU KNOW IF THIS BILL DOES MOVE FOR ALL THE CERTAINLY BE CAN A- CLOSER LOOK AND WE KNOW. YES INSERT PLACES. AND T. EIGHT LIKE YOU ALWAYS DOING GOOD FACE APPRECIATE YOUR HARD WORK HERE AND I THINK. YOU KNOW WE GOTTA DO SOME HERE TO SOLVE IT SO THANKS FOR POINTS FOR. THANK YOU SENATOR MONNING. THANK YOU CHAIR I WANT TO THANK. CO AUTHORS BRINGING THIS FORWARD- WE'RE IN CRISIS AND HIS SOME OF POINTED OUT THE CRISIS ISN'T LIMITED TO TENANTS IS NOT LIMITED TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. IT'S ACROSS THE BOARD. I DO THINK THE FRAMEWORK THAT YOU'RE DEVELOPING. FIRST AND FOREMOST SHOULD INCENTIVIZE NEGOTIATION NOT STRICT MANDATES BUT NEGOTIATION BECAUSE- AS WE HEAR SO OFTEN ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL AND WE HAVE. YOU MIGHT HAVE A SMALL FAMILY RESTAURANT IN THE MIGHT BE HAVE A LEASE IN THE BUILDING. ALSO OWNED BY A FAMILY THAT'S FACING TOUGH MORTGAGE GADGIL VERSES. MAYBE A CHAIN OF THREE RESTAURANTS THAT RENDON DIFFERENT PROPERTIES FROM ALL LARGER COMMERCIAL LANDLORDS SO. TO ME THE STRENGTH OF THE BILL MOVING FORWARD IS TO INCENTIVIZE ENCOURAGE NEGOTIATION IN MAY BE WITH SOME GUIDELINES I SHARE THE CONCERN OF SENATOR TO ROSS SO I KNOW THE FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES IS A FEDERAL DEFINITION OF SMALL BUSINESS FIVE HUNDRED OR LESS. TO ME THAT SEEMS. LIKE A LOT OF EMPLOYEES IN DOESN'T REALLY CAPTURE. THE SIZE OF SMALL BUSINESSES OPERATING IN MY DISTRICT SO I WOULD BE. OPEN TO SOME REVIEW OF THAT OF THAT CUT OFF TO REALLY. FOCUS IN ON. HE REAL SMALL BUSINESSES FAMILY BUSINESSES NIGHT CORPORATE CHAINS THAT HAVE FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES. I THINK ON THE GUIDELINES OR OR LOOKING NOT TO MANDATES BUT MAYBE SOME GUIDELINES- IN SOME OF THE TESTIMONY WE HEARD. THERE WAS A SUGGESTION OF. BECAUSE OF LIMITED CAPACITY IN A RESTAURANT OR BAR. THE OWNER OF THAT BUSINESS LET'S SAY MAKES 50% OF WHAT THEY WERE MAKING PRETTY COVE IT- AGAIN MAYBE A GUIDELINE NOT A DIRECTIVE THAT IN THE FRAMEWORK WOULD BE TO LOOK AT WITH THE LANDLORD AT A 50% ADJUSTMENT. ON THE RENTAL OBLIGATION- OR SOME PROPORTIONAL SO THE LANDLORDS NIGHT. SUBSIDIZING THE ENTIRE OPERATION ON THE RENT SIDE WHEN THE OPERATION IS BRINGING IN REVENUES SO THAT MIGHT BE A GUIDELINE. ANOTHER MIGHT BE SOME ENCOURAGEMENT FOR MEDIATION- MANDATORY MEDIATION IS KIND OF AN OXYMORON WE KNOW THAT THAT EXISTS IN FARM LABOR. UNDER THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR LAW INTACT TO MANDATORY MEDIATION. MAYBE SOME MANDATE THAT WITHIN A CERTAIN WINDOW OF TIME THE PARTIES HAVE TO COME TOGETHER IN LOOK AT SOME OF THE GUIDELINES OR CRITERIA SUGGESTED IN THE BILL- I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE AN UPHILL FIGHT IS YOU'RE WELL AWARE OF ON THE TWO THIRDS THE URGENCY BECAUSE BUT IT IS URGENT NEEDS THE RELIEF IS NEEDED NOW. NOT NEXT YEAR. SO I APPLAUD YOUR WORK WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE CURRENTLY OPPOSED IN. BEING OPEN TO SOME MAYBE MORE INPUTS THAT WOULD MOVE PEOPLE TO A NEUTRAL POSITION- IN MAYBE AGAIN THROUGH A LOOK AT SOME OF THE PROPORTIONAL. GUIDELINE IS SUPPOSED TO A MANDATE ON. ADJUSTMENT OF RENT OBLIGATION SO THOSE ARE MORE COMMENTS NOT REALLY A QUESTION BUT THROUGH THE CHAIR FEW WANT TO REACT TO ANY OF THAT I WOULD. WELCOME THAT THROUGH. THIS VERY BRIEFLY- I APPRECIATE ALL OF THAT A AND WE WILL- KEEP THAT VERY MUCH IN MIND- AND I WILL ALSO SAY. THAT I AGREE WITH YOU IT'S ABOUT ENCOURAGING NEGOTIATION WITHOUT MICROMANAGING BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS GONNA BE DIFFERENT ONE THING I WANT TO STRESS. THIS IS NOT ABOUT LIKE YOU KNOW SOMEONE HAS FIVE OR TEN YEARS UNDER A LEASE. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE WANT WHEN YOU'RE GONNA AUTOMATICALLY RESTRUCTURE THE LEASE TO PERMANENTLY CHANGE IT. IT COULD BE BUT YOU GET A RENT REDUCTION FOR THE NEXT FOUR MONTHS BECAUSE WE ALL ARE PREPPING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS BE A MORE EFECTIVE TREATMENT OR VACCINE. THE BACK TO THE WAY THEY WORK. SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS OF YOU KNOW READING SHE IN A WAY THAT'S NOT STREET. AND THAT'S TAILORED TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN TIME TABLE CANCER THANK YOU CENTER THANK YOU SO WILL THAT. AS YOUR SERVICE YEAH I JUST TWENTY A COUPLE CALL. HERE IN A WE MENTIONED LEAVE WE WALK IN THIS IS A TWENTY. PAGE AND NOW. IS A CALL. IS THERE IS MORE WORK TO BE DONE AND I DEFINITELY. APPRECIATE THAT IN KNOWING YOUR WORK KNOW THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO- WE YOU KNOW WE DON'T USUALLY REGULATE COMMERCIAL TENDENCIES LIKE WE DO RESIDENTIAL TENANCIES BECAUSE WE PERCEIVE THAT THERE'S GREATER PARITY BETWEEN THE PARTIES. TO A COMMERCIAL LEASE IT'S NOT ALWAYS TRUE BUT BY AND LARGE COMMERCIAL TENANTS- KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND CAN HOLD THEIR OWN AGAINST COMMERCIAL LANDLORD. STATE DOESN'T USUALLY GET INVOLVED WITH CLEARLY. WE ARE IN A VERY DIFFERENT WORLD AND I THINK WE ALL HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT YES WE COULD LITIGATE THIS AND MAYBE THAT IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN BUT THE EXPECTATIONS ON WHICH RESTAURANTS AND BARS AND SMALL BUSINESSES GROUNDED THEIR DECISIONS WHEN THEY SIGNED THEIR LEASES HAS BEEN TOTALLY TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. AND I THINK WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE WE ARE LIVING IN A WORLD THAT MOST OF US COULD NOT HAVE IMAGINED. AND SO- I HEAR WHAT THE OPPOSITION SAYING ABOUT HOW THE- THE BILL INTERFERES WITH CONTRACT AND- IN ALL THOSE TRADITIONAL OLD CONCERNS THAT ARE EXPRESSED BUT- YOU KNOW THIS IS A WORLD WHERE WE'RE REQUIRING SOCIAL DISTANCING KEEPING PEOPLE HOME. RESTRICTING DINING IN RESTRICTING. HOW FOOD CAN BE PRESENTED ESSENTIALLY RESTRICTING PROFITS. AND SO WE ARE ALREADY RADICALLY ALTERED IN THIS REALITY UPON WHICH THOSE CONTRACTS WERE BASED AND I MEAN A YOU KNOW CORONAVIRUSES THE ONE THAT INTERFERED WITH THESE CONTRACTS. AND I JUST THINK WE HAVE TO READ AND SAID TO PRETEND THAT THIS HAS NOT IMPACTED EVERY PART OF OUR DAILY LIVES. IS JUST TO BE LIVING UNDER A ROCK. I MEAN WE ARE ALL EXPERIENCING THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TO HEAR WITH THESE STUPID MASKS ON. THE THAT ARE FAR UP GLASSES I DON'T KNOW BUT ANYBODY ELSE BUT IF YOU'VE GOT A WAY TO AVOID THAT LET ME KNOW- BUT OUR JOB. AS I SEE IT IS TO DO A THING WE CAN TO GIVE SMALL BUSINESSES AND RESTAURANTS AND BARS AND- OTHER BASED ON ARE. THE TOP OF THE- THIS. SHOULD NOT BE A FINANCE BENEFIT. TO ANYBODY ESPECIALLY AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS AND I THINK YOU HEARD FROM US SENATE DERIVE SO. THE CENTER MORNING SENATOR STERN AS WELL CONCERNS% ABOUT CREATING AN UNFAIR PLAYING FIELD WHICH IS NOT WHAT I THINK YOU. WANT TO DO AND SO- I APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING THE MEMBERS I THINK THAT THEY'VE GREATLY TIGHTENED AND STRENGTHEN THE BILL- AS HE ANALYSIS NOTES. THERE'S FURTHER REFINEMENT TO BE DONE I THINK YOU'VE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT AROUND WHAT TENANTS OBLIGATIONS WILL BE IF THEY BREAK THE LEASE. AGAIN THIS IS NOT TO GIVE ANYBODY UNFAIR ADVANTAGE. AND I'M AWARE THAT THERE ARE LEASES STRUCTURED IN A WAY WHERE THE LANDLORD HAS. ACTUAL INVESTMENT UP FRONT PARTICULARLY WITH TENANT IMPROVEMENTS AT ALL AND I THINK THESE ARE THINGS AGAIN THAT HAVE TO BE. INCLUDED SO- KNOWING THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE WORKING AND DOING YOUR BEST EFFORT I. WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD I THINK WE'D ALL LIKE TO RESERVE OUR RIGHT TO- AND TO SUPPORT OR OPPOSE DEPENDING UPON HOW THIS BILL. OF ALL THIS AND I KNOW WITH A TWO THIRDS VOTE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO REALLY WORK HARD TO TRY TO. CREATE BALLOTS THAT EVERYBODY- IS LOOKING FOR SO. WITH THAT. IF YOU LIKE BRIEFLY CLOSER IF YOU'RE ALL SET WE CAN GO AHEAD AND I'LL ENTERTAIN A MOTION. I DON'T. A COMMOTION BY SENATOR GONZALEZ THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED. TO SENATE APPROPRIATIONS MADAM SECRETARY IF YOU WOULD PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ASKING SENATORS TO PLEASE TURN YOUR MIKE SOMEONE. THIS IS FILE ITEM NUMBER FOUR SB NINE THIRTY NINE WIENER JACKSON HI JACKSON I DO RUSSELL HI US SO I GONZALEZ HI GONZALEZ I JONES. JONES NO MONNING AYE AYE MONNING AYE STERN BURKE. WHY CAL SKI HI Y. CASKEY I. FIVE TO ONE RIGHT FIVE TO ONE WE WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER THE SHAKING WAS MUCH APPRECIATED THANK YOU WE DO HAVE- THE NEXT BUILT NEXT TO BILLS ARE SENATOR UMBERG'S BILLS BUT HE HAS NOT ARRIVED YET SO I BELIEVE WE WERE GOING TO GO NEXT TO- FILE ITEM EIGHT WHICH IS SB TEN SEVENTY NINE BY SENATOR SKINNER AND I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE FOR THOSE. WHO ARE. IN THE U. TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF EITHER SB NINE EIGHTY OR SB NINE NINETY NINE. THAT WE WILL DEFER HEARING THOSE BILLS SO UPON ARRIVAL OF- SENATOR UMBERG AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE SENATOR SKINNER. BUT I DON'T SEE CENTER SKINNER I'M SORRY IS HERE AND SHE WILL BUT NOW BE PRESENTING A FILE ITEM EIGHT SB TEN SEVENTY NINE. OUR HER MEASURE DEALING WITH RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY. IN WITH THE ACT OF GOOD MORNING STILL SENATOR SKINNER- PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PROCEED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- MEMBERS- PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO. PRESENT SB TEN SEVENTY NINE TWO TODAY I THINK MANY OF US REMEMBER THAT DURING THE LAST RECESSION WHICH WAS GREATLY PRECIPITATED BY A- OF MANIPULATION OF FINANCIAL MARKETS AROUND MORTGAGES AND SUCH THAT THEY WERE RAMPANT FORECLOSURES IN CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND DURING THAT TIME LARGE CORPORATE AND OTHER INVESTORS BOUGHT UP FORECLOSED HOMES AT A DISCOUNT. OWNER OCCUPIED HOMEOWNERSHIP IN CALIFORNIA DROPPED BY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND RENTER OCCUPIED SINGLE FAMILY HOMES INCREASED BY SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND SOME HOMES WERE LEFT VACANT THAT IN THE CONCENTRATION OF OWNERSHIP BY A SMALL NUMBER OF LARGE CORPORATIONS IN MANY NEIGHBORHOODS ARTIFICIALLY RAISED HOME PRICES. THE VACANT PROPERTIES IMPACTED NEIGHBORHOODS AND- THERE WERE LOTS OF NEGATIVE IMPACTS THE CURRENT ECONOMIC FALLOUT OF OUR PANDEMIC COULD CAUSE ANOTHER WAVE OF FORECLOSURES WE'VE ALREADY SEEN EXECUTIVE ORDERS TO TRY TO- MINIMUM FORECLOSURES AND PROTECT OWNERS BUT- DO YOU BELONG SUCH EXECUTIVE ORDERS WILL BE ABLE TO STAND AFFECTED WHEN WE RECOVERY ECONOMICALLY IS TOO SOON TO TELL. THE INTENT OF SB TEN SEVENTY NINE IS TO PREVENT THE SCENARIO THAT KURD DURING THAT RECESSION SB TEN SEVENTY NINE HAS THREE ELEMENTS IT CREATES A WINDOW FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PUBLIC AGENCIES NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND PERSPECTIVE DAVE OWNER OCCUPANTS MEANING THE TENANTS OF A SAY A HOME THAT'S PERHAPS GOING TO GO AHEAD. GO PROCEED ON FORECLOSURE TO PURCHASE HOMES AHEAD OF INVESTORS. BY CREATING A WINDOW FOR THAT PURCHASE PRIOR TO OPENING IT UP TO AUCTION IN A AYE OTHERS. IT MAKES PURCHASE A LARGE NUMBER OF FORECLOSED HOMES AT A SINGLE ACTION MORE DIFFICULT. AND IT ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO INCREASE THE FINES ON VACANT ON MAINTAIN PROPERTIES I HAVE A- VIVID RECOLLECTION DURING THE RECESSION OF WALKING THROUGH THE HOODS IN WHEN A RICHMOND WITH CITY OFFICIALS WERE BY. HOMES THAT WERE ABANDONED I WORK FULL OF RATS THE COPPER HAD BEEN STRIPPED THERE WAS RASH SOME WERE TURNED INTO SHOOTING DANS MEANING A DRUG INJURED IN SHOOTING. OPERATE OWNER SO- DE THE ABILITY TO INCREASE THE FINES WOULD HOPEFULLY CREATE SOME INCENTIVE OF THAT ORDER TO EITHER MAINTAIN THE PROPERTY OR SELL IT OR PUT IT OUT TO WRITE. SO THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL AND I HAVE A GREAT WITNESS ROBERT APODACA FROM CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY BUILDERS TO SPEAK IN WILL LOVE PROVIDE TO SIR WITH A THREE MINUTE SO I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE OTHER.

CAL HFA TO HELP OFFER FINANCING TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS THE BILL ITSELF WE THINK MAKES THE PROCESS MORE INITIATIONS FOR TRYING TO- MOVE HOMES THAT HAVE GUESTS ON THEM ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE DONE IS WE PAY TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS- TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN THE PURCHASE PROCESS- BY COVERING AND BRING IN CURRENT BACK TAXES AND OTHER FEES THAT MAY BE OWES. AND THEN YOU KNOW THE FORECLOSURE PROCESS IS IT IS NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART OFTEN THE HOMES THE A LOT OF WORK WE PUT THE- MAN TO THOSE. AND BRING THEM OVER VERY QUICKLY THEY THE ONE ONE MILLION THEY CAN ALL. SITE IS CERTAINLY OUT OF THE WHOLE THAT WE ARE THAT THERE'S NO RICH ON THE- IF THERE IS TENANTS IN THE HALL. AND SO WE MOVED QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND FOR THOSE REASONS OUT OF STOP THEIR MADAM CHAIR AND- WE OPPOSE THE BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SIR- NOW LET'S GO TO THE- LINES UNLESS THERE'S ANYONE IN ROOM FORTY TWO OR THREE THAT WISHES TO JUST STAND WITH THEIR NAME AND- AFFILIATION IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE LET'S GO TO THE PHONES MISTER MODERATOR IF YOU WOULD Q. UP PEOPLE WHO WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. TO SB TEN SEVENTY NINE AND WE WILL URGE THEM TO REMOVE THEIR PHONES FROM THE MUTE BUTTON NOW. AND MODERATOR IF YOU WOULD GO AHEAD AND LINE THEM UP. THANK YOU IF YOU LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION YOU MAY PRESS ONE THEN IT ZERO AT THIS TIME. ONE THEN IN HERO REMINDER TO MAKE SURE YOUR ON MUTE IT AT THAT POINT. WAIT A FEW SECONDS AND SEE IF WE HAVE ANYONE LINED UP. MISTER MODERATOR TO WE HAVE PEOPLE LINED UP TO- ADDRESS IN OPPOSITION TO SB TEN SEVENTY NINE. THERE IS NO OPPOSITION ON THE PHONE LINES AT THIS TIME YOU MAY CONTINUE. ALL RIGHT. WE'LL GIVE IT ANOTHER TEN SECONDS AND THEN- WILL BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE DYESS. IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION ON THE PHONE MISTER MODERATOR. THERE IS STILL NONE ALL RIGHT WITH THAT WE WILL THEN BRING THE MATTER TO THE DíAS WE'LL START WITH SENATOR Y. KOWSKI AND I SHE DID SENATOR BORCHERS HAS HIS HAND UP AS WELL SENATOR Y. KOWSKI WHY DON'T YOU START BY I JUST HAVE A CLARIFICATION I SEE THAT THE VALUE OF NOT ALLOWING BUNDLING ON TRUSTEE SALES THAT THAT THAT OCCUR IN THAT I THINK OF GOOD. WHAT AM AND I THINK I UNDERSTAND THAT IF THE IF THERE'S NO BID AT TRUSTEE SAID AND THE BANK TAKES IT BACK THAT YOU'RE THERE FOR LOOKING CLOSE TO ALLOW- THE FOLKS TOO BAD. IT OVER. OWNER OCCUPANCY GO AND I SEE THE PUBLIC POLICY BENEFITS OF THAT. THE CONCERN IS I HAVE IS. SOMETIMES IF YOU HAVE A SINGLE TRUSTEE SALE SOMEBODY WILL BID ARE OVER ON THE BANKS NOTE. AND BY YOU KNOW. THESE THESE PEOPLE COME IN AND THEIR THEY'RE AT THE- SEE TAPE. THE AMOUNT AND THEY COME IN AND I THINK. AND A PURCHASE IT I THINK THAT'S THAT YOUR THIRD ONE THAT IT RAISES THE FINES IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY AT THE TRUSTEE SALE. AND YOU PAY AND YOU GET IT NHIáU LET IT GO DERELICT. IF YOU BUY IT FROM THE BANK AFTER THE FOR CLOTHES. ARE YOU STILL IS IT YOUR INTENTION OR DO YOU THINK THAT THAT IF IT WAS FAKE IN THE MAINTAIN. AGAIN THE OPPOSITION SAYS THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN PEOPLE DO THIS PROFESSIONALLY. I DON'T THINK THAT THAT COVERS THAT THEY FIVE FIVE BY FROM THE BANK THE DAY FOR CLOTHES BECAUSE- I DIDN'T FOR CLOTHES. I BOUGHT I BOUGHT THE- PART OF. ABOUT ALLOWS HEALTH. IS AT. SO THERE MAY BE OUR TO THE INTENT IS THAT INDEPENDENT UP THAT THE FINES THE PROVISION OF THE BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO INCREASE ITS FINE SWITCHES SELECTIVE ON THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PART THEY MAY CHOOSE NOT TO BUT THAT PROVISION IS ON THE ON MAINTAINED VACANT PROPERTY REGARDLESS OF OWNERSHIP IS MY UNDERSTANDING NOW THERE MAY BE SOME- WORDING AT ITS LIKE MANY THINGS AND WE KNOW THERE'S MANY OUR CODE SECTIONS AROUND THERE SO I WILL. ASK STAFF TO GO THROUGH MAKE SURE THAT THERE ISN'T A CONFLICT THERE BUT THAT WAS THE INTENT OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE SENATOR BORCHERS. ALL RIGHTY WE TO HAVE HIM ON THE LINE. OKAY YOU MAY GO AHEAD DON'T DON'T TOUCH. THE. YOU DID WE CAN HEAR YOU. TO ME IT IS CANNOT HEAR YOU. BE THERE. START IT'S NOT JUST THE POWER OF THE I'M MUTING ALL OF THEM THANK YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO YOU ARE POSTING QUESTIONS. OUR I MORE OF A CLARIFICATION ENQUIRING IS CAN A LOT OF THESE CONCERNS NOT BE RESOLVED ALREADY BY THE POWERS OF THE LOCAL OF FORTIES AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS. CAN A COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE NOT KICKING THE COUNTY CREATE LOCAL PREFERENCE. FOR BETTING PURPOSES I THANK YOU FOR BEATING ALL THE PUBLIC WORKS. TWO ONE TWO ONE ANSWER THE QUESTION THROUGH THE CHAIR THANK YOU SURE JACKSON SO. AS THESE ARE. OUR ACTIONS THAT THE BANK THE MORTGAGE HOLDER AND IF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION IT WOULD RUN I'M NOT SURE I WOULD IMAGINE THERE MAY BE SOME CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE COUNTY MAY BE ABLE TO EFFECT BUT I DON'T THINK ACROSS THE BOARD THIS COULD BE DONE JUST BUT COUNTY BY COUNTY. I THINK THAT FOR US TO ENSURE THAT ANY THAT WE LIMIT THE BUNDLING AND SUCH WE WOULD NEED THIS STATE OF A STATUTE. OKAY IN TERMS OF. LOCAL CONTROL FOR ENFORCING VIOLATIONS. IN MY PREVIOUS CAPACITY ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN THE VALLEY. IS THAT THE COUNTY OR A MUNICIPALITY HAS THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE VIOLATIONS AND IF THEY DON'T MAINTAIN THE PROPERTY WHICH IS WHAT WE EXPERIENCE WHEN THE BANK OWNED PROPERTIES WERE- OCCURRING YOU KNOW CIRCUIT TWENTY TEN TWENTY ELEVEN. IS THAT THE COUNTY COULD STEP IN AND MAINTAIN THE PROPERTY AND THEN ATTACH A LEAN TO THE TITLE WHENEVER.THAT WAS TO BE TRANSFERRED I GUESS WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS I SEE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING. TO ACCOMPLISH HERE BUT I'M LOOK AT A FROM A LOCAL AUTHORITY STAND. THAT THE POWER EXIST WITH THOSE ENTITIES TO ACHIEVE YOUR DESIRED OUTCOME WITHOUT US ARE CREATING STATEWIDE RULES THAT MAY HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. IF YOU HAVE ANY FINAL THOUGHTS ON THAT THROUGH THE CHAIR PLEASE. I'M AS I INDICATED ABOUT WITH THE QUESTION THAT SENATOR Y. CASKEY ASKED THE STATUTE BEFORE YOU IF WE ADOPT SB TEN SEVENTY NINE JUST CREATES THE ABILITY FOR A LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO INCREASE ITS FINE. THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT NOT CHOOSE TO IT DOES NOT FORCE THEM TO. AND WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING PERHAPS COUNTIES COULD HAVE DONE THAT DURING THE LAST RECESSION IN FORECLOSURE CRISIS. BUT IN- BUT I THINK NOT ONLY MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE BUT THE EXPERIENCE OF MANY COMMUNITIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE WHEN- BUT MANY OF THE- PROPERTIES WERE LEFT VACANT THE CITIES WERE PUT IN EXTRA NEARLY DIFFICULT POSITION. TO IT TO. IT HAVE TOOLS THAT WOULD FORCE THE OWNERS TO EAT TO MAINTAIN THE PROPERTIES OR TO. PUT THEM ON THE MARKET OR PUT A TENDON IN THEM AND- SO WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO DO IS PREVENT THAT SCENARIO- AND THAT IS THE- INTENT OF THAT PART OF THE LEGISLATION BUT AGAIN IT IS COMPLETELY ELECTIVE IF THE- IF CITY X. OR Y. CHOOSES NOT TO THAT IS THEIR CHOICE. AND I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE FINES NOW ARE A THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY THAT'S THE MAX THE CAN BE UNDER STATE LAW AND THAT IF WE REACHED OUT TO A THOUSAND BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT DUE TO THIS PROBLEM BUT IT WAS NOT ADEQUATE. INCENTIVE FOR SOME ENTITIES. THANK YOU WELL I APPRECIATE- ON YOU RESPONDING TO MY QUESTIONS I THINK OF THE OUTCOME I THINK HAS MERIT THE DESIRED OUTCOME HAS MERIT I AM CONCERNED. THAT LIMITING THREE PROPERTIES- IS GOING TO CREATE CHALLENGES FOR COUNTIES WHEN THEY HAVE THEIR PROCESS ALL AT THE COURTHOUSE WERE THE BEATING BECAUSE THEY WANT ONE LO THESE PROPERTIES. AND I THINK MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR LARGER ENTITIES TO PURCHASE IN MARKET PLACE- MAY HAVE AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE THAT CARRIES MAY NOT UP FOR BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS LET ME CHANGE TO CLOSE THE WITH AN OBSERVATION THAT I. RECOGNIZE HIS BILL STILL RELATIVELY. PATIENT IN ITS CONCEPTUAL PHASE AND I THINK THAT THE AMENDMENTS ARE HAVE HELPED TO FLUSH OUT OF THE CONTENT MORE AND HOPEFULLY THE ANALYSIS HELPS TO POINT OUT. SOME OF THE REMAINING CHALLENGES- WORK IN PROGRESS THE BILLS ARE SOMETIMES PROBLEMATIC AND WE DON'T GENERALLY IN THIS COMMITTEE LIKE TO SEE THEM BUT- UNDER THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES IN WORLD WE LIVE IN- I THINK THIS BILL IS TOO IMPORTANT NOT TO CONTINUE- AGAIN ESPECIALLY SINCE WE ARE LIKELY TO FACE A NEW FORECLOSURE WAVE. IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE I HOPE NOT BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC AND- THIS BILL MAY NOT REVERSE A DYNAMIC TOTALLY BUT- YOU KNOW MY CONCERN IS THAT MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS A WE DON'T DO ENOUGH- THE AS WE SAW FROM LAST THE LAST TIME IT REALLY CAUSED. ENORMOUS A PAIN AND SUFFERING TO WAY TOO MANY PEOPLE SO. WITH THAT- ALL MOVED BILL ART WE HAVE CENTER WHY BECAUSE GIVE THE MOTION I WANT TO KEEP AN EYE ON THIS- I THINK MOST OF US. WOULD LIKE TO KEEP THIS GOING WE'LL FIND OUT BUT CERTAINLY RESERVE THE RIGHT PROCEEDING- GOING FORWARD TO SEE HOW THE BILL ULTIMATELY COMES OUT SO WITH THAT- MAY I HAVE A MOTION AND- IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE SENATOR SKINNER THANK YOU APPRECIATE IT. THE IF FIRST OFF I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THIS DOES NOT PREVENT A SAY A BLACK STONE FROM PURCHASING A FOR CLOSE TO IT DOES NOT PREVENT IT WOULD LIMIT THEM TO DURING AN AUCTION ONLY BUYING THREE TO TIME THAT IS CERTAINLY THE CASE BUT IT DOES NOT ELIMINATE THESE LARGE CORPORATE AND IT FESTERS FROM PURCHASING HOMES BY JUST NOTE THAT BEFORE TWENTY TEN INSTITUTIONAL AND LARGE DID NOT EXIST IN THE SINGLE FAMILY RENTAL MARKET ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY AND BY 201695% OF DISTRESSED FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC MORTGAGES WERE AUCTIONED OFF TO WALL STREET INVESTORS. THERE'S BEEN MANY MEDIA REPORTS ABOUT HOW THIS CREATION OF THIS NEW ASSET CLASS THE SINGLE FAMILY RENTAL HOME HAS AFFECTED NEIGHBORHOODS AND IS AFFECTED THE TENANTS IN THOSE HOMES THE- LEASES FOR EXAMPLE ALLOWED MORE THAN ANNUAL RENT HIKES PUNITIVE FEES AND THE RENTERS WERE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE AND MORE THINGS THAT WE'D NORMALLY THOUGHT OF AS REALLY THE ONLY RESPONSIBILITY THINGS LIKE LANDSCAPING MOLD REMEDIATION OF THIS COURT ALL THOSE THINGS. I FEEL THAT WE NEED ADDITIONAL TOOLS TO HELP PREVENT WHAT HAPPENED DURING THAT RECESSION FROM HAPPENING DURING THIS ECONOMIC CRISIS OF THE PANDEMIC. AND WITH THAT AND- WITH THE AMENDED BILL ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND CERTAINLY WILL TAKE VALUABLE- CONSTRUCTIVE IMPROVEMENTS AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE PROCESS. THANK YOU SIR SKINNER WE HAVE A MOTION BY CENTER Y. CASKEY TO PASS AS AMENDED TO SENATE APPROPRIATIONS PLEASE PUT YOUR MIKE SONG.

THANK YOU A GOOD MORNING I THINK IT'S STILL MORNING OUT CHAIR AND MEMBERS TODAY IMPRISONING SB LEVIN FOR A FORTY ONE ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COURSE OF CONTROL THE FIRST ONE I THINK THE CHAIR IN YOUR COMMITTEE FOR WORKING SO DILLON WITH ME AND I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND THE ANALYSIS AND AFTER MEETING WITH ADVOCATE GROUPS AS WELL I DECIDED TO PLACE THE DEFINITION OF COURSE OF CONTROL AND THE FAMILY CODE. THIS BILL IS CRITICAL BECAUSE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS NOT LIMITED TO PHYSICAL ABUSE IT ALSO INVOLVES A PATTERN OF POWER AND CONTROL THROUGH WHICH ABUSERS DOMINATE EVERY ASPECT OF THE VICTIM'S LIFE. UNFORTUNATELY PANDEMIC HAS ONLY PUT A SPOTLIGHT ON THIS ISSUE AS WE SEE NOW. MORE CASES ARE RESURFACING AND WE HEAR FROM. ADVOCATES AND SAFE HOUSES AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT THE CALLS ARE INCREASING DRAMATICALLY. A RECENT LA TIMES ARTICLE STATED THAT WE ARE IN THE WORST CASE SCENARIO FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DURING SHELTER IN PLACE. AND I BELIEVE THAT SOCIAL ISOLATION IS THE IDEAL SITUATION FOR AN ABUSER. IT GUARANTEES FULL CONTROL AND POWER. AWAY FROM PEOPLE EXAMPLE OF COURSE OF CONTROL CAN INCLUDE. BUT NOT LIMITED TO CONSTANT MANIPULATION. AND-SURVEILLANCE THE GRADUAL ISOLATION AWAY FROM FAMILY AND FRIENDS. WHAT HOLDING FINANCES IN BASIC NECESSITIES. WHICH CAN INCLUDE EVEN PROHIBITING A VICTIM FROM GOING TO SCHOOL OR GETTING TOGETHER WITH COWORKERS. AND IT MAKES IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR VICTIMS TO ESCAPE THAT ABUSE. THE PHRASE OF CONTROL EXPLAINS THIS PARTICULAR RANGE OF BEHAVIORS MANY STATES ACROSS THE US HAVE ALREADY IDENTIFIED THE IMPORTANCE OF USING COURSE OF CONTROL. AND IN THE STATUTE AND DONE. THE TEAM PORTION TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT INCLUDING NEW YORK THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL VIOLENCE PREVENTION DIVISION FOUND THAT APPROXIMATELY. FORTY THREE POINT FIVE MILLION VICTIMS IN THE U. S. REPORTED. EXPERIENCING PSYCHOLOGICAL AGGRESSION BY AN INTIMATE PARTNER DURING THEIR LIFE. HOWEVER TO ME THE MOST ALARMING STATISTIC FOUND. THAT CONTROL WITH AN INTIMATE PARTNER RELATIONSHIPS INCREASES THE ODDS OF HOMICIDE. SURE YOU WILL HEAR FROM A MOTHER MY DISTRICT WILL TELL YOU THAT CHRIS OF CONTROL SCARRED HER FOR LIFE. UNFORTUNATELY I ALSO PERSONALLY UNDERSTAND CURSE OF CONTROL IN THE PARALYZING IT HAS ON VICTIMS. THROUGH MY RESEARCH I HEARD COUNTLESS STORIES FROM VICTIMS ABOUT DIFFERENT WAYS CHORUS OF CONTROL IS USED WHICH INCLUDED STARTING VICTIMS. ARE THEY WERE SLEEP DEPRIVED AND COURSE OF CONTROL THAT WAS SO DEVASTATING THAT ALMOST PUSHED HIM TO COMMIT SUICIDE. CALIFORNIA DOES NOT INCLUDE COMPREHENSIVE DEFINITION OF COURSE OF CONTROL AND ANY EXISTING STATUTE. NOW IS THE TIME TO STRENGTHEN OUR LOSS FOR SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND INTRODUCE THE DEFINITION. OF COURSE THE CONTROL. TODAY WITH ME I HAVE TWO WITNESSES HONEST DAVIS A MOTHER AN ADVOCATE IN MY DISTRICT. I ALSO HAVE A LINE EVAN RACHEL WOOD. A SURVIVOR AN ADVOCATE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN A LEADER OF THE PHOENIX ACT PROGRAM AND LASTLY JUST TO ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ON THE PHONE I HAVE THE EXPERT. PAHLAVI TO ONE AN ATTORNEY AND DIRECTOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE POLICY AND PREVENTION AT THE LOS ANGELES CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WITH THAT. I WILL LET MY MIGHT WITNESSES THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR AND TO BE CLEAR FOR THOSE TWO WITNESSES THAT YOU HAVE- WE ARE PERMITTING A TOTAL OF ONLY THREE MINUTES PER SIDE SO BETWEEN YOUR TWO WITNESSES. WILL GIVE THEM THREE MINUTES TOTAL THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DECIDE HOW TO BEST USE THAT TIME I APOLOGIZE BUT GIVEN. THE LENGTH OF HEARINGS TECHNOLOGY AND SO FORTH WE HAVE TO THE LIMIT THEM AT THIS POINT SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND PROCEED TO YOUR FOR YOUR FIRST WITH. BELIEVE WHO IT IN ROOM FORTY TWO OH THREE IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO STEP UP TO THE MICROPHONE HERE. A TWO. MY LEFT IN YOUR RIGHT. AND IF YOU WOULD GO AHEAD AND WE'LL GET YOU STARTED. RIGHT ABOUT NOW AFTERNOON CHAIRWOMAN JACKSON AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY I STAND BEFORE YOU AS A MOTHER A VETERAN OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY A FORMER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PRINCIPAL BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY AN ADVOCATE FOR THOSE WHO SUFFER AT THE HANDS OF AN ABUSIVE PARTNER OR PARENT. THE LAW AS IT IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN DEFINES DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IN PHYSICAL TERMS MEASURING THE SEVERITY OF INJURIES AND BEATINGS IT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE PSYCHOLOGICAL HARM. THE PERCEPTION THAT ABUSE IS SOMETHING THAT IS SEEN AND NOT HEARD IS A GREAT MISCONCEPTION I AM HERE TO GIVE TESTIMONY ON HOW LIFE SHATTERING PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA CAN BE ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE ARE NO LAWS TO PROTECT VICTIMS WHEN. NOT BE SEEN AND PHOTOGRAPHED. EARLY IN MY MARRIAGE TENSION AND AFFECTION THAT MY EX HUSBAND AFFORDED ME WAS UNPRECEDENTED IN MY LIFE HE MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS THE WORLD TO HIM AND NOTHING ELSE MATTERED UNFORTUNATELY THAT DID NOT LAST. AFTER HAVING FIVE MISCARRIAGES MY EX HUSBAND MADE HURTFUL COMMENTS ABOUT MY INABILITY TO HAVE CHILDREN. HE TOLD ME THAT I WAS NOT A WOMAN IN HIS EYES. IF I COULD NOT HAVE A BABY. AND AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF HEARTBREAK I WAS FINALLY BLESSED WITH A BABY BOY MY ONLY CHILD. WHO I LOVINGLY CALL BEAKY. MY EX HUSBAND WOULD CALL ME SEVERAL TIMES THROUGHOUT THE DAY WHILE I WAS AT WORK. HE REPEATEDLY ASKED WHAT I WAS DOING AND WHO I SAW IF I MISSED A CALL HE WOULD INTERROGATE ME AS TO WHY DID NOT ANSWER MY PHONE. HE INSTALLED SPY WERE ON MY PHONE WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE AND HACKED INTO MYLINKEDIN ACCOUNT. CREATED A SECOND ACCOUNT AND SEND REQUEST. TO COLLEAGUES PRETENDING TO BE ME. ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS MY EX HUSBAND THREATEN TO TAKE OUR SON TO WE RUN. OR HE IS FROM. HE MADE IT A POINT TO SHARE THAT WOMEN WERE SECOND CLASS CITIZENS AND I WOULD NEVER SEE MY SON AGAIN. HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT I WOULD NEVER LAST ANY RON BECAUSE I WAS TOO OPINIONATED AND THEY WOULD SIMPLY SHOOT ME AND I HAD TO TAKE CARE OF ME. HE STOLE MY CREDIT CARDS IN MY PASSPORT. HE ACCESS MY MEDICAL RECORDS WITHOUT MY PERMISSION. AND WHEN I TOLD HIM I WANTED A DIVORCE HE CONFISCATED MY BELONGINGS MY CLOTHES MY HEIRLOOMS MY MILITARY MEDALS. EVERYTHING THAT DOT THAT DID NOT FIT IN MY CAR THE DAY I LEFT. IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY SIXTEEN I FILED FOR A RESTRAINING ORDER THE JUDGE WHO PRESIDED OVER MY CASE. WAS GIVEN EVERY FEW DOUBLE EVIDENCE. DOCUMENTING MY EX HUSBAND'S HORRIFIC BEHAVIOR. IN ADDITION TO THE EVIDENCE I SUBPOENA THREE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO WERE DENIED THE RIGHT TO TESTIMONY. THE JUDGES READ THE JUDGE'S RESPONSE. WAS THAT THEY WERE THERE FOR CUSTODY REASONS NOT ABUSE. BY RESTRAINING ORDER WAS DENIED. HOWEVER HAD I WALKED INTO THE COURTROOM WITH THE BLACK ARE BROKEN ARM PERHAPS THE OUTCOME WOULD BE DIFFERENT. AS OF TODAY I HAVE LIVED ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DAYS WITHOUT MY SON. ON APRIL TWENTY FIRST. OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. SUFFOCATED MY SON IN THE BACKSEAT OF HIS VEHICLE WELL MY SENSE LET. TRAPPED INTO HIS CAR SEAT. AFTER A DAY LONG TRIP AT DISNEYLAND. ACCORDING TO HOMICIDE DETECTIVES MY SON- BOOK DURING THIS VIOLENT ACT. IN HIS FIRST ATTEMPT OF SUFFOCATING MY SON FAILED. AND MY SON SAID HELPLESSLY IN HIS CARSEAT BODY TWITCHING MY EX HAS SUFFOLK HIM A SECOND TIME. HE USE MY SON SWEATER. AND THEN HE PROCEEDED TO DUMP MY SON'S BODY IN A HEAVILY WOODED AREA IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY. MY GIVE FIVE YEARS. TWO MONTHS AND TWO DAYS OLD. ACCORDING TO DETECTIVES EVIDENCE SEIZED DURING THE HOMICIDE INVESTIGATION SHOWED THAT MY EX HUSBAND BEGAN PLANNING THE MURDER SHORTLY AFTER MY REQUEST FOR A RESTRAINING ORDER WAS DENIED. MY EX HAS BEEN COMMITTED THIS HEINOUS CRIME BECAUSE HE COULD NO LONGER CONTROL ME. DURING HIS CONFESSION HE TOLD DETECTIVES THAT HE HATED ME AND HE WANTED TO HURT ME AND HE DID. HE HURT ME IN THE DEEPEST AND MOST IN HUMANE WAY POSSIBLE. COULD YOU I'M SORRY I HATE TO DO THIS THIS IS THIS IS MY LOVING HEART WRENCHING COULD YOU WRAP NOTHING THAT I DO I KNOW WILL BRING MIGHT BE KEY BACK. BUT EVERYTHING THAT YOU WILL DO TODAY. AND FROM THIS POINT FORWARD CAN SAVE LIVES. AND I IT IS MY HOPE THAT YOU SUPPORT THIS BILL AND RECOGNIZE THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND I KNOW EVERYONE SHARES OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES FOR YOUR LOSS THIS IS WHERE THE SYSTEM HAS FAILED US ALL. CASTING THANK YOU. BY WE'VE USED OVER THE THREE MINUTES BUT I AM GOING TO THIS IS I THINK AN IMPORTANT ISSUE WE'RE GOING TO GIVE UP. THE NEXT WITNESS ON TWO MINUTES TO SPEAK AND THEN WE WILL GO ON WITH OTHER WITNESSES IF YOU IF YOU WOULD TO. THE FLOOR SURE. AT TWO I THANK YOU MY NAME IS EVAN RACHEL WOOD AND I AM A SURVIVOR OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE- IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE MISTER VIOLENCE ARE ALSO UNDERSTANDING COURSE TO CONTROL BECAUSE WHEN DISCUSSING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PEOPLE USUALLY TALK ABOUT THE INCIDENTS OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE WHICH ARE SO HORRIFIC THEY WONDER WHY THE KING DIDN'T LEAVE IMMEDIATELY BUT THEY DON'T ALWAYS ACCOUNT TO THE MONTHS OR YEARS OF COURSE TO CONTROL THE TOOK PLACE BEFORE. THE TEENAGER I WAS GROWN BY AN OLDER MAN INTO AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP IN THE BEGINNING HE WAS NICE CHARMING I NEVER THOUGHT HE WOULD HURT ME THE LONG WE WERE TOGETHER HE SLOWLY CHIPPED AWAY AT MY FREEDOM YOU'VE GOT THE TOUCH MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY BY BECOMING IRATE INCONSOLABLE WHEN I CONTACT WITH THEM EMOTIONAL ABUSE WITH THAT. BEHAVIOR SCARED ME INTO COMPLYING YOU MONITORED WHEN I EAT AND CONTROLLED WHEN I BLOCKED WHICH LEFT ME HUNGRY PRIDE AND DISORIENTATED HE BECAME OBSESSED WITH HOW I LOOK AND WE'RE CERTAIN THINGS WHAT ALLOWED TO WHERE HE WOULD NOT ALLOW YOU TO PAY FOR ANYTHING AFTER WE MOVED IN TOGETHER I REALIZED I HAD NO RIGHT TO ANYTHING HE WOULD ALLOW ME TO PAY MY SHARE OF THE RENT HE MADE IT CLEAR HE COULD THROW ME OUT AT ANY TIME. HE THREATEN MY REPUTATION BY TAKING PHOTOS OF MY NAKED BODY AND AT TIMES THREATENED TO RELEASE AND PUBLICLY WITHOUT MY CONSENT WHICH I LATER CAME TO KNOW IT'S CALLED REVENGE PORN OR NON CONSENSUAL **** YOU HAPPEN TO MY PHONE AND SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS I CANNOT REACH OUT FOR HELP HE WAS MONITORING ME. ON THEIR OWN ISOLATION ALONG TO CONTROL RT DANGERS WILL SCARY BUT MULTIPLE FORMS AGAINST ONE PERSON CAN BE DEADLY THINGS CAN HAPPEN TO ME ALL AT ONCE BUT ONCE THEY WERE ALL IN A I FELT TRAPPED THEN BECAME SEXUALLY INTO WE DO AS ISOLATION CONTROLLER PEOPLE WHO HARM CLEAR THE PATH PROVIDE BECAUSE THEY DON'T MAKE ME CREE MORE TO PROTECT TO ESCAPE. ESCALATED TO VIOLENCE OR WHEN THE VICTIM WAS DEAD. AND I BELIEVE STRENGTHENING OUR KNOWLEDGE OF COURSE TO CONTROL OUR STATE WIDE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LISTENING COMMUTING. WELL DONE THANK YOU SO MUCH I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN A STRONG ADVOCATE FOR THIS A EVAN. RACHEL WOOD AND- APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY WITH THAT WE ARE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND OPEN UP THE- OF PHONE LINES IN THE SEARCH ANYBODY IN FORTY TWO OR THREE WHO WANTS TO ADD THEIR NAME AND AFFILIATION.

THERE ARE NONE THANK YOU ALL RIGHT- BEFORE WE COULD GO TO ANY QUESTIONS ARE. YOU ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS SENATOR CORRECT THANK YOU. AND OF COURSE- I THINK WE ALL SHARE SUPPORT FOR. THE GOAL OF THIS BILL. WE KNOW DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS FUNDAMENTALLY ABOUT POWER AND CONTROL. WHETHER IT'S PSYCHOLOGICAL OR PHYSICAL OR JUST INDUCING FEAR. IT IS SO THE CHALLENGES JUST MENTION IS OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE THE SHOW WILL BRUISES A LOT EASIER TO BE ABLE TO PROVE THEN THE EMOTIONAL ON THE MENTAL DISTRESS. THAT IS CREATED OFTENTIMES BY. THESE PEOPLE WHO WISH TO CONTROL OTHERS AND IT'S A CHALLENGING ISSUE BUT- I KNOW% THAT YOU WERE WORKING ON TRYING TO MAKE IT AS CLEAR AS WE CAN. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE- WHICH IS SIMPLY CANNOT TOLERATE THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR IN OUR SOCIETY- WILL WELL IT IS SOMEWHAT RAMPANT IN THE STORY. THAT WE HEARD EARLIER IS JUST HEARTBREAKING THERE ARE SO MANY STORIES LIKE THIS AND SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD AND- I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME. ADDITIONAL CONCERNS THAT SOME OF THE- GROUPS THAT WOULD NORMALLY SUPPORT THESE MEASURES HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AND I KNOW YOU'RE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK SO THAT WE GET AS MUCH CLARITY AS POSSIBLE. AND MAKE THIS EFFECTIVE LAW GOING FORWARD ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS SENATOR WHITE CASKET. YEAH I HAD A QUESTION ON JUST SOME SOME CLARITY AND SO THE VAGUENESS OF SOME OF THE MEETINGS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT COERCIVE CONTROL YOU KNOW CAN BE COMMITTED DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY AND I GET THAT IN THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL SAYS. OR THROUGH THE USE OF THIRD PARTIES AND BY MEANS OF ANY INSTRUMENTALITY SO I GUESS MAYBE YOU WERE HERE YEAH EXPERTISE I DON'T KNOW WHAT ANY INSTRUMENTALITY DOES. AND HOW WOULD EIGHT DOES THIS COURSE OF CONTROL DOESN'T OCCUR BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES IT'S HAD AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THIRD. PARTY THAT'S IN THERE ONLY THAT THAT'S THERE'S NO DIRECTOR INDIRECT. ACTIVITY OR SO IF YOU COULD THANK YOU ARE THOUGHT SO I WILL START WITH THE FIRST PART- AS I HAD VERY LENGTHY CONVERSATIONS WITH HONEST OF US ISHERE AND- ABOUT HER COURT CASE IN WHICH SHE EXPERIENCE- HAVING BROUGHT FOR THE FACT THAT HER EX HUSBAND WAS THREATENING TO KIDNAP HER CHILD TAKEN TO ANOTHER COUNTRY WHAT WOMEN DIDN'T HAVE RIGHTS DRAIN INTO HAVE A SHOT IN A DIFFERENT COUNTRY LIKE NONE OF THAT. WAS ACCEPTED BY THE COURTS IN HER CASE AND STILL ARE AT TEN REALLY WAS TO HIGHLIGHT THAT SOMETIMES A USE A THIRD PARTY LIKE IN THIS CASE FOR CHILD ABOUT EIGHT KNOWLEDGE YOUR CONCERN AND WE WILL CONTINUETO EXPLORE THAT BUT WE WANTED TO MAKE IT CLEAR EYED THE MISCONCEPTION IS THAT MOST JUDGES WOULD UNDERSTAND THIS AND I HAVE TO SAVE FOR. PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT. THE JUDGES DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THAT THAT DODD LIVED EXPERIENCE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AND SO WE WANTED TO CLARIFY. THAT A THIRD PARTY CAN BE USE LIKE IN THE CASE OF ANNA- IN YOU KNOW IN MY CASE IT WAS A THIRD PARTY AND THEY WOULDN'T ACCEPT TESTIMONY CELL. MY POINT IS THAT WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IN ON THIS CASE HAD THEY BEEN BLE TO BRING AND HER SITUATION ALL THE- THREADS HER EX HAS BEEN MADE AND- IN REGARDS TO HURTING HER SON'S KIDNAPPING HIM AND ALL THAT. MAYBE WE WOULD HAVE A DIFFERENT OUTCOME BUT I WILL CONTINUE TO EXPLORE THE FISH AND SEE HOW WE CAN. CLARIFY IT I MEAN IT SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR CUT DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY. BUT IN HER CASE IT DIDN'T WORK SO WE WANT THE SYSTEM TO WORK AND MAKE SURE THERE'S NO BAKE NOUS. BUT I'M COMMITTED TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH CANCER WE CAN CLARIFY THAT OR- SEE IF IT'S NECESSARY BUT I WILL LOOK FURTHER INTO IT. YEAH I THINK I THINK INCLUDING COURSE OF CONTROL IN THE DEFINITION WILL HAVE A THIRD. OUR BENCH DECIDED THIS IS THIS IS A APART OF ABUSE THAT THAT LEVEL LIKE IT. AND I GET DIRECTLY INDIRECTLY SHE'S THROUGH ANY INSTRUMENTALITY. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IT MAY I ADD IN YOUR RIGHT WE'VE HAD THAT DISCUSSION ABOUT INSTRUMENTALITY AND I WANT TO WORK ON CLARIFYING THAT. WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE- WITH SOCIAL MEDIA JUST GROWING AT SUCH A- FAST PACE FOR EXAMPLE TWITTER AND FACEBOOK WAS IN OUT. AROUND IN THE EIGHTIES NINETIES IT GETS- THERE'S MORE ODDS TOOLS THAT ABUSES CAN USED TO MANIPULATE EMBARRASS HER HUMILIATE INDIVIDUALS. AND SO WE WERE TRYING TO. MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S PART OF THE PROCESS BUT IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT AND WE START NAMING THE TOOLS THAN IT LIMITS. THE ABILITY FOR SOMEONE TO SAY. YOU KNOW A NEW TOOL COMES UP LIKE SPY WARE AND I WAS IN PART OF THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT WE NAMED SO WE DIDN'T WANT TO BE VERY- PRESCRIPTIVE SOUL SB STOOLS ARE COMING ON. TERRY BUT I USE IT BUT I WILL ALSO COMMIT TO SEE IF WE CAN. AT LEAST GIVE SOME EXAMPLES CLARIFIED A LITTLE SELL ANY JUDGE WOULD EASILY SEE THAT THEY'RE LIKE SOCIAL MEDIA TOOLS AND OTHER TOOLS THAT HEY CAN EMBARRASS A PRINTER. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO THANK YOU CENTER Y. KOWSKI AND PART OF THIS TOO IS WE PROBABLY NEED TO DO OME BETTER EDUCATING OF OUR JUDGES- AND I KNOW THAT WE DO WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT SO THAT THEY BECOME MORE SENSITIZED. TO THESE ISSUES BECAUSE SO MANY STORIES ARE. SOHORRIFIC. IN THE BEHAVIOR SO OUTRAGEOUS IT'S HARD TO SOMETIMES BELIEVED BUT IT'S THERE AND WE KNOW IT'S THERE IN THE COURTS NEED TO BE EDUCATED. WE HAVE. SENATOR AND SAW FOLLOWED BY SENATOR MORNING AND THEN. DOROS YES THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- WE SPOKE AND YOU CERTAINLY AND LIKE ME ABOUT THE ISSUE OF COURSE OF CONTROL BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THERE'S SO MANY NUANCES AND GRAY AREAS IN THIS WHOLE. SCHEME OF THINGS I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AS WELL AS MRS THAT AS I KNOW- THIS IS PROBABLY THE HARDEST THING YOU'VE HAD TO DO IS TO CONTINUE TO SPEAK ABOUT THE ISSUE I REMEMBER SEEING YOUR YOUR- YOUR SON'S FACE AND HIS BEAUTIFUL FACE ON TV SO JUST KNOW THAT ANY OF US YOU KNOW. HAVE CERTAINLY- THAT YOU KNOW WITH US AND WE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TESTING TESTIFYING EVEN DURING THE CIRCUMSTANCES- I TO LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HOW THIS YOU KNOW DEVELOPS WITHIN THE COURTS AS WELL BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF EDUCATION WE NEED TO DO TO BE ABLE TO BRING THIS FORWARD AND ENSURE THAT THERE'S JUSTICE FOR ALL. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU A SENATOR MONNING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I TO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR. BRINGING THIS FORWARD. YOU'VE BEEN A LEADER IN THIS AREA AND I KNOW. HOW TOUGH IT IS I WANT TO THINK YOUR WITNESS TO AND EXPRESS OUR CONDOLENCES FOR HER LAWSON THINKER FOR THE COURAGE TO SHARE THAT STORY WITH THIS SOME. SO COURSE OF CONTROL THE EXAMPLE OF YOUR WITNESS WAS EXTRAORDINARY RESULTING IN DEATH THE MURDER OF HER SON. IN MANY CASES IT'S NOT AS EXTREME IN TERMS OF THE OUTCOME BUT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL VIOLENCE- VIOLENCE TO THE SPIRIT. THAT'S WHAT'S NOT BEEN RECOGNIZED BY THE COURTS IN YOUR BILL SEEKS TO INCLUDE THAT IN THE RANGE OF FORMS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST VICTIMS AND THE COURTS HAVE BEEN NARROW IN MY VIEW- LIMITING IN INTERPRETATION OF VIOLENCE TO PHYSICAL VIOLENCE- VIOLENCE TO THE SPIRIT VIOLENCE TO THE HEART CONTROLLING. SOMEBODY'S ACCESS TO RESOURCES CONTROLLING ACCESS TO FAMILY MEMBERS THREATS THREATS OF. ELIMINATING ACCESS TO A CHILD. IN MANY WAYS THAT VIOLENCE IS MORE PAINFUL MORE LASTING VAN. THE PHYSICAL VIOLENCE THIS MAY RESULT IN THE WOUND HEALS BUT THE TH THE VIOLENCE TO THE SPIRIT THE VIOLENCE TO THE HEART IN SOME CASES NEVER HEALS SO.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION- CARRIER INTENT IS NOT TO CATCH ANYONE IN THE SYSTEM OR THEIR FALSELY ACCUSE BUT I LIKE THE KEY WORD THROUGHOUT THE BAIL AND THE KEY WORD IS ON POINT PATTERN. AND STILL DO YOU STILL HAVE TO PROVE THEIR THEIR CASE IN COURT BUT FOR LIKE ON A STATUS FOR EXAMPLE THE TESTIMONY WASN'T EVEN ALLOWED BECAUSE THERE WASN'T A NAME TO IT SO IT IS ON BOWLING PATTERN AND IT'S ALSO STILL UP TO THE INTERPRETATION OF THE JUDGE TO TEAM DAD EVIDENCE OR TESTIMONY.

THAT TO NOT OF HAVING THEIR RENT PAYMENT. MAJOR RULES. THREE MEASURE MANY TIMES YOU SEE CRY BUREAUS USED TO NOT. INDIVIDUALS ARE RIGHT TO RANT WE JUST SAY USES TO ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO BUILD CREDIT. BY FOCUSING ON SUBSIDIZED HOUSING BILLS TAILORED TO THOSE TENANTS LIKELY TO RECEIVE THE GREATEST BENEFIT FROM ESTABLISHING OR IMPROVING THEIR CREDIT SCORES. ELEVEN FIFTY SEVEN ALSO INCLUDES A DELAYED- OPERATIVE DATE OF JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO ALLOW TIME FOR LANDLORDS TO DETERMINE. HOW BEST TO COMPLY AND WHAT MAKES THE BEST SENSE FOR THEM. ELEVEN FIFTY SEVEN IS A SIMPLE GOAL TO REVIVE RUNNERS A WAY TO ESTABLISH OR PROVE THEIR CREDIT SCORES TO THE PAYMENT AROUND ON TIME. WE ALL KNOW A RENTERS TO HAVE LIVED TO LEASE I DO AND ONE PLACE FOR. THOUSANDS OF YEARS AND NEVER MASS MISSED A RENTAL PAYMENT BUT AS SHOWN NO BENEFIT TO THEIR CREDIT SCORES THIS WILL FOR THEM THAT OPPORTUNITY. WE ALL KNOW THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF WORK THE CONSEQUENCES WHEN YOU FAIR BILL THE PAY YOUR RENT SO. THERE'S NO REASON RUNNERS WHO REGULARLY PAY THE RENT ON TIME SHOULD RECEIVE POSITIVE IMPACTS. OF A CREDIT SCORE BY TWO- AND OUR WITNESSES AT STATUS SEARCH AND THEN FROM THE CURRENT OF BUILDERS ALLIANCE AND JOSE QUINONES. FROM THE MISSIONS ASSET FUNDS IF THEY'RE AVAILABLE.

ADDRESSING CREDIT MARKETS ALREADY TIGHTENING. WITHOUT A CRIME CREDIT SCORE INDIVIDUALS PAY HIGHER INTEREST AND FEES ARE ALSO PRODUCTS. AND SPEND MORE ON THE SOCIAL SERVICES LIKE CAR INSURANCE YOU CELL PHONE. THIS CREATES WHAT WE IT SHOULD. X. INEQUALITY AND COMPOUNDS HARDSHIP MAKING IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR HOUSEHOLDS TO GET AND STAY AHEAD. WINTERS ARE ALREADY MORE LIKELY TO HAVE LOWER INCOMES. WELL THEN THERE HOMEOWNER COUNTERPARTS AND SEVEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO HAVE MINIMAL CREDIT HISTORY THAT IS BEING DONE FOR. FURTHER MORE MANY HAVE FEWER OPTIONS THE BILL THEIR CREDIT HISTORIES AND RENT RECORDING. OF THE PRUDENT STRATEGY TO HELP THEM. YEARS AGO SHE CAN A PILE THAT INCLUDED A THOUSAND LOW INCOME RENTERS 79% OF THOSE SAW THAT THEIR CREDIT SCORES INCREASED BY AN AVERAGE OF TWENTY THREE POINT IN THAT THE RESULT. 15% OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS MOVED INTO A LOWER RISK CHAIR EVERY RENTER YOU START WITH THE PILOT- CREDIT AND DIFFICULT BECAME SQUABBLE DURING THE PROGRAM AT A HIGH OF NON PRIME OR PRIME LEVEL. THE FUEL BY THESE FINDINGS AND SUBSEQUENT EFFORTS YEAH I HAVE SEEN GREATER INTEREST IN RENT REPORTING AT HIGH IN AS A HIGH IMPACT- DILUTION IN LARGE PART BECAUSE THE PLACE BASED IT'S SIMPLE AND SCALABLE. WE'VE ALSO BEGUN TO SEE POLICY IN STATES LIKE NEW YORK MASSACHUSETTS AND YOU SEE PROMOTE RENT REPORTING IS A VIABLE AND POWERFUL CREDIT BUILDING STRATEGY. HOWEVER CALIFORNIA WOULD BE THE FIRST IN THE NATION TO REALLY MOVE THE NEEDLE FOR LOW AND MODERATE INCOME RENTERS SPEAKING TO ESTABLISH ONE THROUGH THEIR CREDIT SCORES WITH THE POTENTIAL TO REACH AN ESTIMATED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF LOW.

BEEN IN CONSTANT CONVERSATION WITH- MISTER BRADFORD AND- HIS ABLE STAFF TRYING TO CRAFT OUT A AN ACCEPTABLE BILL WERE NOT THERE UNFORTUNATELY- AND LET ME GIVE YOU THE- THE REASONS WHY IT IS VERY VERY PROBLEMATIC FOR THESE- HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF UNITS THAT ARE OWNED AND MANAGED IN CALIFORNIA- FIRST OF ALL. THIS BILL FOCUSES ON LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE IN JUST THESE UNITS AND NOT ALL THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS ARGUABLY MILLIONS OF LOW INCOME HOUSING HOUSED IN UNITS THAT ARE DEEMED RESTRICTED THAT ARE NOT HEAVILY RESTRICTED FOR UP TO FIFTY FIVE YEARS.

JEFFERSON JACKSON THERE ARE NONE IN Q. AT THIS TIME THANK YOU SIR BRING THIS BACK TO THE DIET SENATOR BOARD USE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CAN YOU HEAR ME YES INDEED. THANK YOU- MY QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR THROUGH THE CHAIR. JUL BLUDGEONING IS. WHY WOULD IT NOT BE MORE EQUITABLE TO HAVE. OUR LOW INCOME RENTERS THAT DO NOT RECEIVE STATUS SYSTEMS. BE ELIGIBLE FOR OUR CREDIT REPORTING- REGIMEN THAT YOU'RE IDENTIFYING HERE. WITH THAT NOT SEEM MORE EQUITABLE THAT. ALL OF RENTAL HISTORY HE REPORTED. SENATOR BRADFORD WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND WELL THE STATE QUESTIONNAIRE. ESSENTIALLY I BELIEVE THE QUESTION IS SHOULDN'T ALL RENTAL HISTORY TO BE REPORTED INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE NOT ON. ASSISTANCE IS THAT IS THAT THE QUESTION CENTER BORCHERS. ESSENTIALLY IT US. I WOULD AGREE WITH THIS BUT THIS IS THE FIRST STEP OF TRYING TO HELP INDIVIDUALS ESTABLISH CREDIT SOUL AS WE OFTEN SAY WE DEVELOPED A ONE BITE AT A TIME SO THIS IS OUR FIRST ATTEMPT AT SUBSIDIZED HOUSING TO HELP ON THE SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION A STOLID SO. CREDIT HISTORY. SAID ANSWER QUESTIONS SENATOR IT DOES- PARTIALLY- I THINK I CAN APPRECIATE THE PREDICAMENT THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE IN WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE THE MEANS BY WHICH TO ACHIEVE OF FACTORS THAT GO INTO CREDIT WORTHINESS ARE. STANDARDS IT JUST SEEMS A LITTLE UNFAIR TO THE ESSENTIALLY WORKING FOLKS IN IN WORKING COR IF YOU WILL IN MANY INSTANCES WHERE YOU DON'T RECEIVE STATE ASSISTANCE. AND DON'T DRIVE A BENEFIT SO WERE ALLOWING A BENEFIT. TO EXIST WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE HAVING STATE ASSISTANCE. AND NOT HAVING THE DISCRETION OVER THOSE DOLLARS THAT WOULD NORMALLY GO TO THE RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S PRESCRIBED. THE SECTION EIGHT OR SOME OTHER PROGRAM- I WOULD JUST FIRST I WOULD ASK HE AUTHOR IF YOU WOULD CONSIDER. THROUGH FRIENDLY AMENDMENT THAT IF YOU WERE TO MOVE FORWARD THAT IT NOT BE FOR OUR STATE OR FEDERAL. FEDERALLY SUBSIDIZED HOUSING SUPPORT HI JUST RANGERS AS A WHOLE I THINK. THAT I THINK WE MORE EQUITABLE AND THE SECOND WOULD HE CONSIDER THAT THE MOM AND POP LANDLORDS. OUR THAT WOULD NOW BE REQUIRED TO ISSUE THIS TYPE OF OUR OUR- MONTHLY YEAH RECORDING OR ORIENTAL REPORTING THAT WOULD NOT BE BETTER YES THE ENTITY THAT PROVIDES THE- OUR SUPPORT. SECTION EIGHT OR HARD TO BEAT THE ENTITY RESPONSIBLE WITH SUBMITTING. THAT REPORT BECAUSE- I THINK WE'RE GONNA BE ASKING A LOT OF FOLKS TO BECOME VERY SOPHISTICATED NURSES QUESTIONS ARE. HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO IT NOW WILL BE MY FINAL REQUEST- FOR YOU TO CONSIDER AND MAYBE EVEN IF YOU CAN RESPOND TO THAT NOW IT I'D LIKE TO. WELL AS IT RELATES TO THE MOM AND POPS I KNOW PLENTY MOM AND POP LANDLORDS WHO OWN. HUNDREDS OF UNITS IN NO NONE OTHER BUILDING SOMETIMES EXCEED MORE THAN TEN UNITS PER UNIT AND THEY CONSIDER THEMSELVES MOM AND POP RUNNER SO I DO UNDERSTAND THE SMALLER FOLKS WHO. OWN THREE OR FOUR UNITS AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE ASKING FOR DELAY IN IMPLEMENTATION TO HELP WORK OUT SOME OF THOSE COULD KINKS AND CONCERNS THAT ARE. WILL BE FACED BY SOME THESE LANDLORDS IT'S ALSO A TEN DOLLAR FEE THAT I. I'M WILLING TO ACCEPT TO AID BILL SMALL MOM AND POP OUR LANDLORD SO THEY DON'T- BEAR THE FULL COST OF THIS REPORTING PROCESS BUT AGAIN. IF THIS MEASURE MEASURES PASSED WE HAVE UNTIL JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO WORK OUT SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS AND HELP ADDRESS AND FACILITATE. THOSE SMALL OPERATORS IN A MEETING THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVE HERE AND AGAIN THIS IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM IT'S NOT MANDATORY- IT HAS TO BE AGREED UPON BY BOTH THE RENTERS AND THE LANDLORD IN ORDER. FOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I JUST LIKE TO ADD I THINK PART OF THE REASON IS IT'S MANY LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA'S ARE OFTEN UNBANKED WERE UNDER BANK SO THEY HAVE NO CREDIT HISTORY- WHATSOEVER- AND IT HAD LITTLE OR- NO ESTABLISHED. OPPORTUNITY SO- AGAIN MADE BEING VOLUNTARY AYE I THINK THAT IS A NEW WANTS THAT THAT IS DESERVING OF A ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AS WELL THANK YOU. SEEING NO OTHER A SENATOR TO ROSS SO YEAH I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU I THINK IT'S GREAT I THINK TAKEN A- BIG STEP FORWARD. THESE ARE THE FOLKS WHO HAVE THE HARDEST TIME ESTABLISHING CREDIT. I MEAN YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE- IN THE OWN YOUR HOME IF YOU. OWN IF YOU ON THIS OR THAT OR YOUR INCOME THAT'S MUCH EASIER- RESTART YOUR STARTING WITH THE ONES THAT ARE HAVING THE MOST DIFFICULT TIME. AND TRYING TO USE THAT THE FACT THAT THEY ARE GOOD AND PAYING THEIR RENT. YOU KNOW AS A WAY OF SHOWING THAT THEY'RE WORTHY OF A GOOD CREDIT EXCITED. I THINK IT'S GREAT THANK YOU. SO ARE WILL ENTER. A MALL. IS TO REMOTE. BY THE MOVE BY THE THIS STERN OF THE CENTER BRED IF LIKE TO RE CLOSE. THANK YOU KNOW WHEN TO THANK OF- OF THE SUPPORTERS OPPOSITION ON ON THE ADDRESSING THIS MEASURE AGAIN WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION TO JR DRESS SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS BUT I THINK THIS AGAIN SHOWS HOW CALIFORNIA CAN LEAD TO NATION AND MOVING FORWARD AND SERVING SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO CALL THAT NINETEEN BUT NOW IN LIGHT OF THIS. AND LET ME ADDRESS THE- BECOMING CREDIT WORTHY AND THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS GO BUY A STEREO OR CAR. BECOMING CREDIT WORTHY YOU MIGHT MOVE OUT OF BEING A RUNNER FOR TWENTY AND THIRTY YEARS AND BY YOUR FIRST HOME SO THAT'S WHAT MANY PEOPLE STRIVE TO DO WHEN THEY BECOME CREDIT WORTHY IS NOT GO OUT AND BUY A STEREO. BUT BE ABLE TO QUIT BEING AROUND HER AND ONE DAY BE A LAND OWNER AND A PROPERTY OWNER AND OWN THEIR OWN HOME SO I RESPECTFULLY I SURE I WILL. THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION TO PASS A TO THE SENATE FLOOR BY SENATOR STERN. EVERYBODY EXCUSE ME AS TO PASS AS AMENDMENT EXCUSE ME TO THE SENATE FLOOR MICROPHONES ON PLEASE MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MISSION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE SENATE FLOOR THIS IS FILE ITEM NUMBER THIRTEEN SB ELEVEN FIFTY SEVEN BY SENATOR BRADFORD. JACKSON HI JACKSON I DID ALSO I GONZALEZ HI GONZALEZ I JONES. MONNING AYE MONNING AYE STERN AYE STERN AYE BURKE. I'M BURKE I WAKE CAL SKI. TWO THREE NINE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX OF SIX ZERO LEAVE IT OPEN SIXTIES HERE WE WILL KEEP THE ROLE OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD THE COMMENTER MEMBERS ARE. SAFE TRAVELS.

A YEAR TIME- VERY GENTLEMANLY AND I'LL PROBABLY TAKE A LOT OF HEAT FOR GOING OUT OF- FILE ORDERS ARE WAS DIRECTED TO DO BUT THE- OFFER GOOD CAUSE AND WE WILL START NOW IS FILE ITEM FIVE SB NINE EIGHTY. Q. MANTRA THAT WAS ME SMILING PROBABLY COULDN'T TELL. OF RESULT LET LET ME THANK YOU IN THE COMMITTEE FOR- SUGGESTING AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE- THAT IMPROVE THE BILL I CERTAINLY ACCEPT THEM- WHAT WHAT THIS BILL DOES THIS BILL- ADDRESSES THE ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO. GENETIC DATA THAT MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS PROVIDE TO VARIOUS ENTITIES OF FOR PURPOSES OF FOR EXAMPLE ASSESSING THEIR ANCESTRY I HAVE DONE THAT MYSELF- BUT I WAS ALERTED TO AN ISSUE THAT I HADN'T QUITE THOUGHT ABOUT EARLIER- THIS YEAR. WHEN I THOUGHT THE PART DEFENSE MEMO THAT ADVICE MILITARY MEMBERS NOT TO PROVIDE THEIR DNA TO DIRECT TO CONSUMER GENETIC TESTING COMPANY BASED THE FOLLOWING THESE DTC GENETIC TESTS ARE LARGELY UNREGULATED AND COULD EXPOSE PERSONAL AND GENETIC INFORMATION AND POTENTIALLY CREATE UNINTENDED SECURITY CONSEQUENCES INCREASED RISK TO THE JOINT. FORCE AND MISSION- WHAT WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT SAYS SIMPLY THAT. IF YOU PROVIDE YOUR DNA. AND THE ENTITY TO HOME YOU PROVIDE THE DNA WHICH IS TO USE IT FOR OTHER PURPOSES WHAT ITS RESEARCH OR EVEN COMMERCIAL PURPOSES THEY CAN DO SO. THEY JUST NEED YOUR INFORMED CONSENT AND SO THE BILL. AS A PROHIBITION ON ENTITIES PROVIDING. INFORMATION WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT- THE ISSUE IS PROBABLY MORE ACUTE NOW THAT WE HAVE. COVE IN NINETEEN TESTING ALTHOUGH COVERT NINETEEN TESTING TESTS FOR OUR NAY DOES NOT TEST FOR DNA BUT WHAT IS CAPTURED CAN ALSO BE USED FOR DNA PURPOSES. AND ONE OF THE ISSUES IS THAT- AS REFLECTED BY THE BUSINESS INSIDER IS THAT IS DE IDENTIFIED CAN ULTIMATELY BE IDENTIFIED TO A SPECIFIC HUMAN BEING- WE ARE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT WE DO NOT WANT LAW ENFORCEMENT TO- NOT HAVE THIS INVESTIGATIVE TOOL- BUT- THAT THAT. IT IS STILL AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED- BOTTOM SIX DRUM BAND I. WHISPER WITH I'VE- IT THANK YOUVERY MUCH MY UNDERSTANDING WE HAVE WE HAVE WITNESSES ALSO LET ME LET ME INTRODUCE THE WITNESSES- OR WITNESS OF MISS MAUREEN MAHONEY A POLICY ANALYST FOR CONSUMER REPORTS VERY GOOD MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU ARE PRESENTING HERE IN OR DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER WITNESSES ON THE PHONE. I DO NOT ALL RIGHT WITH THAT MS MAHONEY YOU ARE OR HAVE A TOTAL OF THREE MINUTES IF YOU'D LIKE TO USE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO. BUT IT IS AVAILABLE THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING OR I SHOULD SAY GOOD AFTERNOON. AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY MY NAME IS MAUREEN MAHONEY I'M A POLICY ANALYST AT CONSUMER REPORTS. AND WE'RE PROBABLY SUPPORTING THIS BILL BECAUSE IT WOULD GIVE CONSUMERS. IMPORTANT PRIVACY PROTECTIONS OVER SOME OF THEIR MOST UNIQUELY SENSITIVE DATA. DATA COLLECTED BY DIRECT CONSUMER TESTING COMPANIES. THIS DATA CAN PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO WHETHER OR NOT BOB CONSUMERS OR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS ARE VULNERABLE TO. CONSTANT ABILITY EATING DISEASESLIKE BREAST CANCER FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS. THAT'S INFORMATION THAT CAN BE USED TO MAKE IMPORTANT DECISIONS ABOUT CONSUMERS THE CONSUMER SHOULD BE IN CONTROL OF THAT. MILLIONS OF CONSUMERS HAVE ALREADY UC'S KIDS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL HEALTH ISSUES. AND DISCOVER THAT CONSUMERS WILL LIKELY ASSUME THAT THE STATE IS PROTECTED BY STRONG. HEALTH PRIVACY LAWS LIKE HYPOCRISY IN MIAMI. THEY DO HAVE DEFAULT PROTECTIONS OVER DISCLOSURE OF DATA. BUT UNFORTUNATES NOT THE CASE. IN TERMS OF PRIVACY THIS DATA IS CHIEFLY. REGULATED BY THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT. UNFORTUNATE SO MUCH WEAKER LAW THAT PROVIDES NEXT NEW CONTROLS OVER WHAT COMPANIES CAN USE THIS DATA FOR. IT DOES HAVE AN OPT OUT A SALE BUT THAT ONLY TAKES IN AFTER THE CONSUMER TAKES AFFIRMATIVE ACTION SO THAT MEANS THAT BY DEFAULT COMPANIES COULD SELL THE STATED TO THIRD PARTIES LEGALLY. THIS BILL CORRECT BALANCE BY INSURING MEANINGFUL CONSENT SOFT FOR SECONDARY USES AND DISCLOSURE OF THIS DATA. EVEN IF IT'S AN DE IDENTIFIED FORM PUTTING CONSUMERS SQUARELY CONTROL OF HOW THIS INFORMATION IS TYPICALLY USED AND FOR THAT FROM. IN THIS BILL IS TIMELY ASSESSING OUTSIDE OF THE HEALTHCARE. LIKELY TO INCREASE IN LIGHT OF COVER NINETEEN- WHATEVER FORM THESE TESTS TAKE THAT MEANS THE COMPANIES ARE GOING TO HAVE INCREASED OF PHYSICAL POSSESSION OF CONSUMERS GENETIC MATERIAL AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT'S PROTECTED. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL THAT SORELY NEEDED AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT- ANY OTHER WITNESSES HERE IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES I GUESS OR STONE AND TWENTY FORTY OF THIS MODERATOR WOULD YOU QUEUE UP- WITNESSES WHO WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB NINE EIGHTY FILE ITEM FIVE BY SENATOR ON BURKE.

ALL RIGHT IF THERE ARE NO MORE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT LET'S GO TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE TO WITNESSES CALLING IN WITH CONCERNS. GUARDING THE BILL- IS THIS- MISTER ERIC HEATH THE CHIEF PRIVACY OFFER FOUR ANCESTRY AND JACQUI HAGGERTY GENERAL COUNSEL FOR TWENTY THREE AND ME. A MISTER MODERATOR ARE THEY ON THE LINE. THEY ARE INDEED ALL RIGHT SO WE WILL GIVE YOU A TOTAL OF THREE MINUTES- WHOEVER WANTS TO START PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON CHURCH BACK THEN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS JACKIE HAGGERTY I AM THAT THE PM LEGAL AND PRIVACY OFFICER WITH TWENTY THREE ME. ALONG WITH OUR PARTNERS AT THE COALITION FOR GENETIC DATA PROTECTION WE'RE PLEASED TO BE HERE TO DISCUSS AT THE NINE EIGHTY. IT HAD VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH SENATOR UMBERG OFFICE AND ARE HOPEFUL WE CAN GET TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN FULLY ENDORSE THE BILL. TODAY WE SUPPORT THE SPELL IF A MAN DEAD. FROM THE START WE WANT TO SAY THAT WE ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH THE CENTRAL TENET OF THE BELL CONSUMERS SHOULD AT ALL TIMES HAVE CONTROL OVER THEIR GENETIC INFORMATION THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH  DIFFUSE AND WITH HIM THAT INFORMATION IS SHARED. BY FIRE COMPANY JOINED WITH OTHERS IN THE INDUSTRY TO DEVELOP THE PRIVACY BACK PRACTICES FOR CONSUMER. GENETIC TESTING SERVICES. TOGETHER WITH PRIVACY. AND IF YOU OF PRIVATE PEOPLE. WE DEVELOPED WHAT WE BELIEVE ARE THE A PER. GUIDELINES TO ENSURE CONSUMERS HAVE CONTROL OVER THEIR DATA. ARE PRESENTED WITH EASY TO UNDERSTAND PRIVACY POLICIES AND ARE EMPOWERED TO MAKE DECISIONS ON HOW THEIR DATA SHOULD BE IT. AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR- CUSTOMERS THEY PROVIDE CONTENT BEFORE WE PERFORM THE INITIAL AMOUNT THAT THAT THEIR DNA. THEY THEN CAN MAKE A NUMBER OF AFFIRMATIVE OFTEN CHOICES. THEY CHOOSE WHETHER THEIR EXAMPLE SHOULD BE STORED WHETHER TO SEE POTENTIAL GENETIC RELATIVES AND WHETHER TO PARTICIPATE AND HIGHER BE APPROVED RESEARCH PROJECT. THEY CAN ALSO CHOOSE TO DELETE THEIR ACCOUNT. THEIR INFORMATION AND DESTROY THEIR SAMPLE ANYTIME. WE CARE DEEPLY THE CANCER RIGHT TO MAKE THOSE CHOICES AND OUR OBLIGATION TO PREVENT THEM WITH CLEAR INFORMATION OUT THEY MAKE THAT DECISION. WE WANTED TO ADDRESS SEVERAL CLAIMS MADE BY CONSUMER REPORTS TO THE COMMITTEE WHEN THEY STATE THAT GENETIC INFORMATION GATHERED BY DIRECT TO CONSUMER GENETIC COMPANIES CAN BE SHARED OR SOLD TO THIRD PARTIES WITHOUT THE BUDGET TO THE CONSUMER. THEY DIDN'T LEADING OUR COMPANIES ARE SUBJECT TO AN ALREADY COMPLY WITH NOTICE AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CPA. FURTHER WE ARE CONTRACTUALLY FOR CLOTHES FROM ANY SUCH SHARING OR TAIL. FIRED ON TERMS OF SERVICE WHICH WE PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS. WHEN THEY SAY THAT 71% OF COMPANIES CAN YOU CONSUMER INFORMATION INTERNALLY FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN PROVIDING RESULTS TO THE CUSTOMER HE AGAIN QUESTION WHAT COMPANY IS THAT WHAT PURPOSES THEIR BACKGROUND THING. OUR COALITION MEMBERS EXPLAINED IN PLAIN ENGLISH THE USES OF GENETIC DATA IN OUR PRIVATE RESPECTIVE PRIVACY POLICIES. AT AT THE NINE EIGHTY MINUTES FORWARD WE RESPECTFULLY ASK THE AUTHOR AND ALL LEGISLATORS TO KEEP CHOI. CHOICE IS IN THE HANDS OF CONSUMERS AND TO PROVIDE THE FLEXIBILITY IN HOW WE COMMUNICATE THOSE CHOICES AND OBSCENE CONTENT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY OF MISTER HE THANK YOU HAVE A AFFECTED PLEA THIRTY SECONDS BUT I WILL GIVE YOU A MINUTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR BACK THEN-IN ADDITION TO- OUR COMMEMORATIVE CONSUMER PRIVACY WELL. LET ME FIRST SAY THANK YOU- IN JAIL.

THE COMMENTS SO- BETWEEN THIRTY ME- I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT A COUPLE FLAWS- BUT WE ARE STILL WORKING ON WITH THE- WITH CENTERS OFFICE. AND THAT IS- IMPEDING OUR ABILITY TO ENDORSE THIS BILL FULLY VERSES THAT THE DEBT DEFINITION GENETIC GOT IN THE BILL. HE'S FROM THE NINETEEN FIFTY NINE HUNDRED CIVIL RIGHTS ACT- DIST IT IS TIME BARRING DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF GENETIC DATA. I WAS AT THAT TIME RATHER IT WAS YOU KNOW THAT BARRING DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASE TO CHECK THAT IT WAS GROUNDBREAKING- BUT OUR UNDERSTANDING GENETIC DATA AND ITS APPLICATION TO VASTLY EXPANDED- WE'VE- WE'VE SUGGEST A LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE- THE MORE ACT REALLY CAPTURED WHAT WE WOULD NEED TO TALK. WHAT WE WOULD MEAN. ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT GINNY HAD A. THE WOULD BE REPORT. OF THE- IMPROVEMENTS NEXT AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED THE BILL WOULD. ALL BY LAW SAMPLE ENGINE IMPROVE. TO BE JUST. OR DELETED ONCE THE SPECIFIC PURPOSE OF THE AUTHOR A AUTHORIZED BY THE INDIVIDUALS FULFILLED. HERE AGAIN WE BELIEVE THE CONSUMER CONTROL. OVER HOW THEIR DATA AND SAMPLES ARE HANDLED SHOULD SHOULD PREVAIL. WE DO STORE INDIVIDUAL BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES BUT ONLY TO CONSUMER AUTHORIZES US TO DO SO- AND THEY MUST MAKE AN INFORMED CHOICE. ABOUT CHOICE WHEN THEY SIGN UP FOR THE SERVICE CONNECTED THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR- MONEY THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. OKAY ALREADY APPRECIATE THAT.

THANK YOU MA'AM CHAIR I JUST HAD TO CONCERNS AND YOU CAN ADDRESSING DIRECTLY OR IN THE CLOSING WHICHEVER- I APOLOGIZE IF ONE OF THE- OUR WITNESSES AXES ALSO- THAT SHOULD THE TWO MAIN CONCERN IS FIRST- LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS USE THIS INFORMATION OUT. SEVERAL TIMES RECENTLY EXPECT AND SOME HIGH PROFILE CASES- THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER AND SLEEPER WHICH IS IN MY NOTES THEM- ANSWERED HOW DOES THAT IMPACT AND THEN THE SECOND THING THAT WHICH IS PROBABLY. REALLY INTRIGUING TO ME IS THAT THE- THE ACTUAL UP PERSON DOESN'T HAVE THE RIGHT OF ACTION IS ONLY THE- GOVERNMENT AGENCIESOR- THEY CAN RECOVER THE CIVIL PENALTIES AND NOT THE INDIVIDUALS SO. NOT SURE ABOUT THAT. ALTHOUGH SHOULD LIKE TO RESPOND SENATOR. A B. HAPPENED RESPONSE FIRST OF ALL LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR THAT A NUMBER OF COMPANIES ARE DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE QUITE ETHICALLY AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WERE CODIFYING SOME OF THE PRACTICES THAT ADDRESSES SOME OF THE INDUSTRY OUT LIARS NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO IN TERMS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT I AGREE WITH YOU- CENTER JONES THAT IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION- THERE IS A WIDE DISPARITY AS TO HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCESS IS THESE DATABASES RIGHT NOW EVERYTHING FROM A COMPANY REQUIRING A SEARCH WARRANT TO SUBPOENA TO JUST- SHARING IT ON A SORT OF AN AD HOC BASIS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT- WE ARE. WE'RE ADDRESSING THOSE CONCERNS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS ACCESS. SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THEY ONE OF OUR QUERY- THE DATABASE AND THEY HAVE A SUBPOENA- THAT HAS SOME DEFINED PARAMETERS. OF THE CAN DO SO AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA GET THERE SO BUT IT BUT YOUR CONCERN IS AN IMPORTANT ONE. SECONDLY AS TO YOUR INTEREST IN IN AMENDING THE BILL TO ADD A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION- DIED. OF WELL I'M SORRY I MISSED. THE WAY THE BILL'S WRITTEN- IT WELL MAYBE SO I GUESS LIKE THAT BECAUSE THIS IS THIS IS LOCAL PROSECUTORS AN ATTORNEY GENERAL'S. ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT HAVE ACCESS TO BRING A LAWSUIT SO MAYBE THAT IS WHAT I'M ASKING NOW THAT WE- THINK ABOUT- CAN WE MAKE A NOTE OF THAT IS IN THE STORE FIRST TO THAT ONE OF OUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES CECILIA MORE MORE ASKING WHY YOU DIDN'T DO THAT. WELL THAT THAT IS BEEN A POINT OF CONVERSATION. WEEK WE ALTERNATELY DECIDED THAT THAT IT WOULD IT WOULD BE BETTER TO BE THIS IS A COMPLICATED AREA. BETTER BE LIT LEAVING THAT TOOL IN THE HANDS OF A DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS- WITH THAT THERE IS NOT A- LOT OF CRIMINAL PENALTY ONE OF THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WHICH WE'VE TAKEN TODAY IS TO ELIMINATE THE CRIME- BUT- BOB THAT THAT'S A POINT OF CONVERSATION. CENTER JOHNSON. IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE THAT WE WILL BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE THAT AS WELL. I AGREE. VOTE NO TODAY BUT HOPE THAT WE GET THOSE ISSUES WORKED OUT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ALL RIGHT AT THE FOR CLARIFICATION CENTER ON BURGER YOU WILL BE ACCEPTING THE- COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AS AUTHORS MOMENTS TODAY. FORGET YES MANAGER THANK YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING TALKING TO YOUR THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD- BUT I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU THERE WE GO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL- YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS- THE CCPA. SOME WOULD ARGUE DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH- WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE'S DNA HERE THIS IS FOR. PERSONAL INFORMATION I'M SURE A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE THAT THIS INFORMATION CAN ACTUALLY. BE SOLD. OR USED FOR MARKETING PURPOSES WHEN PEOPLE SEEK THE INFORMATION THEY GENERALLY AREN'T WANTING TO SHARE WITH THE WORLD I JUST WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT THEIR FAMILY BACKGROUND IS- SO THE KNOWLEDGE IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND I APPRECIATE THE- CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY THE WITNESSES ON THE- ON THE CALL IN ANTICIPATE THAT THE- THERE WILL BE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS BUT- THE PROTECTIONS THAT. THE ARE PROVIDED BY THIS BILL I THINK ARE ESSENTIAL TO CONSUMERS DESERVE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENIN TO THEIR INFORMATION THEY DESERVE MORE CONTROL. AGAIN ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TO EXTREMELY SENSITIVE INFORMATION AND UP. A WHILE I DO SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS AROUND THE PRECISE LANGUAGE USED HERE. I KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR AND HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN THIS AUTHOR HAVING THE- APPRECIATION FOR THIS AND THAT THAT. YOU WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS AND THE COMMITTEE TO ENSURE THE UP. THE GOALS THE NOBLE GOALS OF THIS BILL ARE A CHEAT AND SO WITH THAT IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BRIEFLY CLOSE. AND WILL TAKE A- MOTION AT THAT TIME. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR UTTERED VIRGIN IVEL ALREADY A IS OUR MOTION A MOTION BY SENATOR TO ROSS SO AND THE MOTION IS DO PASS AS AMENDED TO SENATOR.

HI X. AND I'D TO WRESTLE BY JUST SO I GONZALEZ HI. SALAS I JONES NO. JONES NO MORNING NINE MONNING AYE STERN AYE. STERN I AM BURKE I. I'M BURKE HIGHWAY CASKEY. ONE AT SIX TWO ONE LEGAL SIX TWO ONE WE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU SENATOR UMBERG WILL MOVE ON TO YOUR TO YOUR FINAL BILL WHICH IS FILE ITEM SIX SB NINE NINE. NINE THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. OF SB NINE NINE NINE ADDRESS IS AN ANOMALY IN THE LAW- I THINK ALL OF US HERE RECOGNIZE THAT MOBILE HOMES ARE DIFFERENT THAN APARTMENTS IN TERMS OF. ACTUAL MOBILITY AND THAT ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO RENT STABILIZATION ARE DIFFERENT FOR MOBILE HOMES AND THEY ARE FOR YOU KNOW THE TRADITIONAL TENANT- THE ANOMALY IN THE LAW IS THAT. WHEN A LOCAL JURISDICTION PASSES A RENT STABILIZATION ORDINANCE OR RENT CONTROL ORDINANCE. THAT IF A MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS- TENANT HAS A LONG TERM LEASE THEY CAN NOT AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE PROTECTIONS OF THAT LOCAL ORDINANCE. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT SIMPLY RETURNS- TO LOCAL CONTROL THE ABILITY TO ENACT RENT STABILIZATION ORDINANCES THAT WOULD IMPACT. OF MOBILE HOMES AS WELL AS OTHER- DWELLINGS. SO THE- THE CHALLENGE WITH RESPECT TO MOBILE HOMES. IS THAT THIS IS- UNKNOWN TO A NUMBER OF MOBILE HOME. RESIDENTS TENANTS THE DATE MAY NOT KNOW. IN FACT I WOULD ARGUE THAT MOST DO NOT KNOW THAT IF THEY SIGN A LONG TERM LEASE THAT THAT THEY'RE BASICALLY PRECLUDING- THE PROTECTIONS OF A RENT CONTROL ORDINANCE. AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS THIS THIS- REMOVES THAT THAT EXEMPTION. ORIGINAL VOTE THANK YOU AND SO THAT WE'RE CLEAR IN THE DISCUSSION ARE A YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE BE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS SINCE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS IS THAT CORRECT. YES MA'AM SURE I AM ALSO I HAVE A MISTER JULIA ALL OF THE CHIEF OF STAFF COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AND BUSINESS AFFAIRS.

CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS ALL IDEOLOGIES OF STAFFORD LA COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AND BUSINESS AFFAIRS I'LL BE OUT OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS PROUD BECAUSE BONTA DIMINISH THE NINE NINE NINE. FIRST ELECTED THANK SENATOR UMBERG TOWARD LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. THE BILL WOULD ALLOW JURISDICTIONS SUCH AS THE COUNTY OF LA TO EXPAND LOCALLY ENACTED MOBILE HOME RENT STABILIZATION PROJECTIONS THE LONG TERM MOBILE HOMES BASERUNNERS MUCH IN LINE WITH CURRENT STATEWIDE INITIATIVES THAT ARE AND TO KEEP THE PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES. ESPECIALLY DURING THIS PANDEMIC MANUFACTURED A MOBILE HOMES ARE ONE OF THE LAST BASTIONS OF NON SUBSIDIZED AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE STATE. THE COLD NINETEEN BAND THAT MAKE HAS ONLY FURTHER EXACERBATED THE NEED FOR LOCALITIES TO HAVE GREATER FLEXIBILITY TO PROVIDE SOLUTIONS THAT ADDRESS. THE NEEDS OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS DURING THE ECONOMIC REALITIES WE'RE NOT FACING CURRENTLY STATE LAW PROHIBITS INCORPORATED CITIES AND COUNTIES. LONGER THAN TWELVE MONTHS AS SUCH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE PREVENTED EXTENDING PROTECTIONS TO MOBILE HOMES BASERUNNERS WERE OFTEN SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF RENTAL BE USES. INCLUDING REASONABLE RENT INCREASES COERCION INTO SIGNING EDITORIAL ON TERM LEASES AND TENANT HARASSMENT FOR RETAIL. AND BECAUSE MOST MOBILE HOME CAN I USUALLY. THEIR SEMI AFFECTS HOW. THERE ARE THERE ARE LEFT TO FEW OPTIONS ONE CAN WITH EXORBITANT INCREASE. ALL RIGHT OKAY. OR UNDER LEASE TERM. FIRST OF THIS YEAR THE COUNTY WILL ALSO AN ACCIDENT SO RENT. OR TO PROVIDE PROTECTIONS. EXCESSIVE RUNNING. EVICTIONS WITHOUT JUST CAUSE AND EFFECT DOES. THE MOBILE SPACE. HOWEVER THIS IT'S ALL COVER THE SO 60% OF ALL MOBILE SPACES IN THE COUNTY SERVICE AREA. RIGHT LONG TERM LEASE EXEMPTION. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW OKAY TO EXTEND THESE COULD TO ALL NEW TERM SPACE RUNNERS AND SUBSEQUENTLY ALL ALONG EXISTING LONG TERM SPACE RUNNERS AT JANUARY. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. YEAH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THIS EXEMPTION ENACTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE. WAS PURPOSE TO ALLOW OR ENABLE MANAGEMENT HOMEOWNERS TO CONTRACT FOR THE- HOW TO OTHERWISE AVOID THE MINISTRY TO PROCESS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUT WHILE THOUGH IS DEFINED AND CONCEPT JUST HAS WORKED. AN INSTRUMENT WILL COLD IT'S BEEN A- LONG TERM LEASES ARE. BOB IN NC TO FIVE. THEY HAVE A LOT OF ONE SIDELAND. UP CENTRIC IN THEM. AND WE JUST A NUMBER SCHOOL TO DO SIGNATURE OF LONG BEACH INCLUDE. FICTION THAT LAST ONE IS SIDE WITH A PART IT'S CHANNELS. WITH A LARGER POP. WERE ONE DOOR TO DOOR TO THANKS SIGNATURE. IN CREEK IN DECIDING THEY THOUGHT WERE SO CAL. BEING DENIED THERE SO TWO HOUR REACHED. BECAUSE THEY DON'T GET A COPY OF THE LEASE ALLOWED SEPT TWO HOURS. OR CAN GET LEADING INCREASE AFTER LEASE AND DID NOT HOME. AS HAPPENING WILL CARP.

THERE'S NO ONE IN THE QUEUE. LEAD LET US MOVE THEN TO THE OPPOSITION WITNESSES WHO WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION I WILL GIVE YOU EQUAL TIME AND THAT IS THREE MINUTES AND FORTY SECONDS TOTAL SO IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO START GIVE US YOUR- NAME AFFILIATION AND PROCEED WITH THAT. AFTERNOON THANK YOU MADAM TEACH ME THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS CHASE AND I CAN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS ALLIANCE- IT IS IT IS TRUE THAT CIVIL CODE SECTION SEVEN NINE EIGHT POINT ONE SEVEN ALLOWS A PARK OWNER IN A RESIDENT TO ENTER INTO A LEASE AGREEMENT THAT IS A LONG TERM ISN'T SUBJECT TO RENT CONTROL- WHAT HASN'T BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE PROPONENTS OF THE BILL THERE AND NUMBER PROTECTIONS IN THAT LAW- THAT RESIDENTS ARE ENTITLED TO BEFORE THE PARK OWNER. CAN ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT THAT IS AND SUBJECT TO RENT CONTROL IT WAS STATED EARLIER THAT RESIDENTS MAY NOT KNOW THAT THEY ARE ENTERING INTO AN AGREEMENT THAT IS AND SUBJECT TO RENT CONTROL BUT ONE OF THE PROTECTIONS IS THAT THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THE LEAST AND TWELVE POINT BOLDFACE FONTS HOUSE TO STATE THE POLICE IS NOT SUBJECT TO A LOCAL RENT CONTROL MARTIN. IT'S IT HAS TO BE GIVEN THIRTY DAYS TO REVIEW. AND RIPPED. REJECT THE AGREEMENT- THEY HAVE TO BE GIVEN THREE DAYS TO AVOID THAT AGREEMENT ONCE SIGNED. AND IF THEY CHOOSE TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO REVIEW OR- A BOY THAT AGREEMENT- THEY THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO A SHORT TERM LEASE UNDER. ESSENTIALLY THE SAME TERMS AT LEAST IN TERMS OF RATES AND CHARGES- AS AS LISA THEY IN GOSHEN THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN LONG TERM. AND FINALLY- THE ANALYSIS. IT NOTES I EVEN THOUGH IT DOESN'T DISCUSS THE FIRST SENTENCE REQUIREMENTS- THE ANALYSIS DOES KNOW THAT THERE'S A DISPARITY BETWEEN THE LANDLORD POTENTIALLY IN A RESIDENT BECAUSE A LANDLORD ENTERS INTO MULTIPLE- LEAST AGO SHE SINCE A YEAR. AND HAS MORE FAMILIARITY WITH THE LAW. BUT BUT THERE'S ANOTHER PROTECTION THAT ADDRESSES ARE MITIGATES THAT CONCERNED BY REQUIRING THAT A PARK OWNER PROVIDE SEPARATELY IN WRITING NOTIFICATION. THAT THE RESIDENT HAS A RIGHT TO REJECT THE AGREEMENT. AND HAS A RIGHT TO AVOID IT AFTER THREE DAYS AFTER SIGNED YET. SO FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF OUR CLIENT WE BELIEVE THAT. THE PART. THE LAW A LOT. A LANDLORD IN A- PRESIDENT NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH WITH ONE ANOTHER. AND SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT FOR THAT MAKE YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY NEXT WITNESS PLEASE YOU'VE GOT ABOUT A MINUTE AND FORTY SECONDS. THANK YOU. UNDER GOVERNOR ON. OF WMA AGAIN IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE CENTER ON BURKE- A COUPLE OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE BROUGHT UP IN THE ANALYSIS FIRST AND FOREMOST AS THE CONSTITUTIONAL ARGUMENT OF CONTRACT IMPAIRMENT. AND HOW DOES THIS BILL. LEASES PLACE. PART WE HAVE FIVE AND TEN YEAR LEASES. SO SOMEBODY ENTERED INTO A LEASE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE LAST- TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. HOW DOES THIS BILL AFFECTED- ARE WE GOING TO BE IN COURT LITIGATING THIS SO OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS. THAT WE WOULD SEE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING GOING FOR YOU CAN IMPAIR EXISTING CONTRACTS IN FOR DISCLOSURE BY THE WAY. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING TO CENTER ON BURKE. AND HE DID TASK US WITH GOING BACK TO OUR BOARD OUR MEMBERS WITH FOR DOING WE DIDN'T HAVE. TIME TO DO IT FOR THIS COMMITTEE BUT HE HAS TASKED US AND. HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH US TO SEE IF WE CAN FOR FIND A RESOLUTION. THAT I OF US MAY BUT WE MIGHT. THE PROBLEM LONG TERM CONTRACTS AS- RIGHT NOW. IN MY RECKONED JURORS. ARE LONG TERM LEASES ARE BELOW RENT CONTROL WHICH MEANS IN LOS ANGELES IF IT'S A SAYS YOU GET A 2% A YEAR INCREASE. WHY WOULD WE DO THAT BELOW RENT CONTROL. BECAUSE WE MAY SAY ON CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS WE DON'T HAVE TO GO TO THE RENT CONTROL BOARD TO MAKE A CASE TO GET A CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT. SO WE MADE A GOOD SHAPE AT LEAST THE CURRENT RESIDENT GETS LAST RENT. FOR THE ENTIRE TERM OF THE LEASE. BUT IN EXCHANGE MAYBE WE GET TO CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS. IN PLACES THAT DON'T HAVE VACANCY DE CONTROL WHICH MEANS YOU CAN FLIP THE RENT ON TURN OVER. WE MIGHT OFFER. NO RATE INCREASES FOR SEVERAL YEARS BUT WE MAY SAY WHEN YOU LEAVE. WE WILL DO AN ADJUSTMENT ON TURNOVER FRIEND SINCE THE CITY OF VISTA CAME UP WITH A MODEL LEASE. THE TURNOVER RATE WAS SIXTY SEVEN DOLLARS PHASED IN OVER TWO YEARS. BUT THE CURRENT RESIDENTS HAD LAST BEEN RENT CONTROL RATES THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. APPRECIATE IT. ALL RIGHT ARM. WE HAVE SOME PEOPLE IN THE QUEUE- BY FEARS THAT THERE MAY BE SOME WHO WANTED TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. SO MISTER MODERATOR WOULD YOU REITERATE- THERE WE WILL TAKE WITNESSES WHO. MAY HAVE WANTED TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT PREVIOUSLY IF THEY WOULD- LINE UP. AND I GUESS GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE SYSTEM. WE DON'T WANT ANYONE WHO'S- LINED UP IN OPPOSITION TO GET OFF THE PHONE. WATER WHICH IS GO AHEAD TAKE PEOPLE AS YOU SEE THEM. LINED UP AND AGAIN IF YOU WOULD ANNOUNCED THE METHOD BY WHICH PEOPLE SHOULD. A CALL IN IN ORDER TO BE PLACED IN THE QUEUE FOR THEIR NAME.

THEY HAVE HAD REAL PROBLEMS WITH THIS- AT THIS POINT IN TIME RENT CONTROL MAKES- PARTICULAR SENSE IN THE MOBILE HOME CONTEXT WHATEVER ITS MERITS ARE AND OTHERS- YOU KNOW RESIDENTS AGAIN JUST CAN'T PICK UP AND LEAVE. AND I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND- AS WE GO FORWARD- IN AGAIN THIS BILL THOUGH DOESN'T TO IMPOSE RENT CONTROL. ON THE PARK OWNERS SHOULD JUST SHIPS THE VENUE WAS I UNDERSTAND A FOR THE CONVERSATION. FROM HERE IN SACRAMENTO TO YOUR LOCAL JURISDICTION. WERE ARGUABLY PEOPLE KNOW BASTIN SENATOR.

THE MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS BEING APPRISED OF THE SITUATION THEY SIGNED A TEN YEAR LEASE AND FIVE YEARS INTO THAT LEASE- THERE'S A RENT CONTROL ORDINANCE THEY MAY NOT HAVE ANTICIPATED FIVE YEARS BEFORE THAT THERE WOULD BE RENT CONTROL. ORDINANCE IN PLACE AND WHAT THAT DOES ISA CRAZY ANOMALOUS SITUATION WHERE YOU'VE GOT.

SIX TO ONE I BELIEVE SIX AND ALL RIGHT WE WILL- LEAVE THE ROLL OVER OPEN FOR OUR ACTION MEMBER WE HAVE ONE MORE BILL THANK YOU SENATOR UMBERG LAST BILL IS- SENATOR DHIRAJ SHOWS FILE ITEM FOURTEEN SB. ELEVEN NINETY. THE FLOOR IS YOURS MA'AM THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON- AND EVERYBODY. FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE- BUT SENSE NETIQUETTE. IT'S GOOD TO TALK TO EACH OTHER. NEVER GET TO SEE ANYBODY OKAY FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR- AND JUST EXCELLENT- WORK ON THE NOW THIS IS OF THIS BILL AND- I WANT TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS AS DETAILED ON PAGES ELEVEN TO FOURTEEN OF THE COMMITTEE AALYSIS. GIVEN THE ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS CAUSED BY KOBE NINETEEN CRISIS THE STATE REALLY SHOULD FOCUS ON KEEPING CALIFORNIANS IN THEIR HOMES ONE OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN NEEDS WE HAVE IS TO LIVE IN A SAFE AND SECURE HOME. I AM PROPOSING PROTECTIONS FOR TENANTS EXPERIENCING THE MOST VULNERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS VICTIMIZATION. AFTER A VIOLENT CRIME VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILY HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS MAY NEED TO RELOCATE QUICKLY. STAYING IN THE VICTIM'S HOME MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF DEVELOPING POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AND EXPOSE VICTIMS TO EVEN FURTHER VIOLENCE. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA LAW ENSURES THAT VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT STALKING HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND ABUSE OF AN ELDER FOR DEPENDENT ADULT. AND FAMILY MEMBERS WHO LIVE IN THEIR HOUSEHOLD CAN TERMINATE THE LEASE WITHOUT PENALTY FOLLOWING THE VICTIMIZATION HOWEVER. VICTIMS OF OTHER VIOLENT CRIMES FOR EXAMPLE COOL VICTIMS OF HOMICIDE SURVIVORS OF GUN VIOLENCE AND SURVIVORS OF ROBBERY. AND THEIR FAMILY AND HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS DO NOT HAVE THE SAME RELOCATION OPPORTUNITIES THESE VICTIMS OF OTHER VIOLENT CRIMES SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO BREAK THEIR LEASE FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR SAFETY THEY SHOULD JUST HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RE LOCATE. BREAKING THE LEASE COULD LEAVE TENANTS RESPONSIBLE FOR FINANCIAL PENALTIES MARK THE TENANTS CREDIT SCORE AND LEAD TO FUTURE LANDLORDS DISCRIMINATING AGAINST THE TENANTS SB ELEVEN NINETY WOULD ALLOW VICTIMS AND FAMILY HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS TO RELOCATE WITHIN A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS FOLLOWING THE CRIME. IN THE SECOND PART OF THE BILL I AM PROPOSING LOCAL ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING TENANT PROTECTIONS LAST YEAR FOURTEEN EIGHT AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO WAS PASSED AND SIGNED INTO LAW. IT CODIFIED JUST BECAUSE PROVISIONS AND RENT CAPS RATE CAPS RENT CAPS HOWEVER AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO HAS VERY LIMITED ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS TENANTS MUST TAKE THEIR CASES TO THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE GUIDANCE ON THIS PROCESS. SB ELEVEN NINETY EIGHT WOULD ALLOW ENFORCEMENT BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THIS MEANS THAT A CITY ATTORNEY INCLUDING THE CITY ATTORNEY OF A CITY AND COUNTY A DISTRICT ATTORNEY OR ANY COUNTY COUNCIL CAN ENFORCE THOSE PROVISIONS. AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO IS THE LAW AT THIS TIME WE NEED TO MAKE AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO ACCESSIBLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS FOR THESE REASONS I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRING SB ELEVEN NINETY BEFORE YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY WITNESS TODAY WILL BE TO CHANTE MCCOY FROM GROUP CRIME SURVIVORS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE TO CHANTE WILL SPEAK FOR THE ENTIRE THREE MINUTES.

I DO NOT SHOW HER ON THE LINE AT THIS TIME RIGHT WILL WE DO HAVE MISTER MORAN WHO WAS INDICATED PREVIOUSLY OF HIS INTENT TO SPEAK FROM THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HOUSING ASSOCIATION. MISTER MORAN WE WILL GIVE YOU UP TO THREE MINUTES IF YOU SO CHOOSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE IT BUT- THE FLOOR IS YOURS. CHAIR AND MEMBERS CATAMARAN WITH AARON READING ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION- WERE OPPOSED TO SB ELEVEN NINETY. SB ELEVEN NINETY WILL PROVIDE A NEW EXPENSIVE MECHANISM TO ENFORCE THE PROVISIONS OF THAT AND IT'S PROTECTION ACT THAT WOULD YOU LAST YEAR'S AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO THIS BILL WILL RESULT IN THE CREATION OF AN EXPENSIVE STATE REGULATORY PROCESS THE GOVERNOR RENT INCREASES AND JUST BECAUSE THE PICTURE NOTICES. LIKE LOCAL JUST BECAUSE MEASURES JUST CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE KIND OF PROTECTION THAT ARE NOW IN FORCE THANK YOU YOU SHOULD BE THROUGH THE UNLAWFUL DETAINER PROCESS A PROCESS THAT IS FULLY OCCUPIED BY STATE LAW. THE BILL WOULD IN BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TRADICIONAL EXPENSIVE PROCEDURAL HURDLES THEREBY NULLIFYING THE INTENDED SUMMARY NATURE OF THE LONGSTANDING UNLAWFUL DETAINER REMEDY. AS WE STRUGGLE TO ENCOURAGE MORE INVESTMENT IN HOUSING SB ELEVEN NINETY WOULD CREATE ANOTHER HUGE DISINCENTIVE FOR THE PRODUCTION OF HOUSING. IN THE STATE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES ON THE LINE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION BY GIVING THEIR NAME AND AFFILIATION. DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION MISTER MODERATOR. I'M MORE LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT THE OTHER INDIVIDUAL IS HERE THEY WERE IN ON ON LINE BUT THERE LINE IT SHOULD. THE CARD FOR GOOD WILL GIVE YOU TWO MINUTES IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION- I BELIEVE FOR. TO DEBORAH CARLTON WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATIONS ARE CORRECT AND IF SO PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN. YES MADAM CHAIRMAN CAN YOU HEAR ME INDEED I CAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DEMóCRATAS THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION PERSONALLY STATE WE ARE FINE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL THAT DEAL WITH VICTIMS OF CRIME THAT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO OUR OBJECTION SURROUNDED THE CHANGES TO FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO. THAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF INTENSE NEGOTIATIONS LAST YEAR THE PARTIES INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION WHO WORKED ON THIS MEASURE IN GOOD FAITH AGREED THAT THE ACT WOULD BE ENFORCED THROUGH EXISTING PROCEDURES. THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED THAT THIS LOG IS THE STRONGEST RENTER PROTECTIONS IN THE NATION SOME OF YOU WERE EVEN CO AUTHORS INCLUDING SENATOR DORADO TO NOW GO BACK ON THE PROMISES MADE. AND TO MOVE THIS BILL WOULD BE WRONG. THIS BILL WE BELIEVE AS A VEILED ATTEMPT TO CREATE A REVENUE STREAM FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACCORDING TO THE LANGUAGE OF THE PROPOSAL A LOCAL GOVERNMENT. COULD FIND SMALL AND LARGE OWNERS TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EACH AND EVERY BY ELATION OF THE ACT INCLUDING TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS. THIS IS QUITE FRANKLY OUTRAGEOUS THE BILL IS INAPPROPRIATE USE OF THE LEGISLATURE'S TIME DURING A CRISIS CREATED BY THE CODED PANDEMIC. THE LEGISLATURE MUST SPEND ITS TIME FOCUSING ON EQUIPPING FRONT LINE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. RESTORING THE ECONOMY AND HELPING CALIFORNIANS BOTH OWNERS AND TENANTS WITH THE DEBT DEBT THAT THEY HAVE ACCUMULATED DURING THIS CRISIS. NOT ON ARMING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH A CARTE BLANCHE TO ENFORCE STATE LAW AND UNDERMINING THE UNLAWFUL DETAINER PROCESS THAT WE WORKED SO HARD ON LAST YEAR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BUT NOW WILL GO TO THE PHONES FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO STATE THEIR NAME AFFILIATION AND OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE SB ELEVEN NINETY.

SENATOR DORADO ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FOR YOU FROM ANY MEMBERS CENTER ON BURKE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR A SENATOR RUSSELL. IF YOU COULD CLARIFY SOMETHING A TEN IN THE CAN- AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE PROTECTIONS OF THIS ACT OF WITH A SOME SORT OF ATTESTATION I SEE FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN'T ATTENDANCE OF. WILL SO THE PROTECTIONS WITH JUST SIMPLY A STATEMENT OF THE TENANTS OR DOES IT REQUIRES SOME OTHER VERIFICATION. A YES IT IT CAN BE THEIR OWN STATEMENT BUT LET ME DOUBLE CHECK OUT WITH- COULD HAVE ANDREA. VERIFY THAT FOR ME. THIS IS ANDREA ON THE PHONE IS ANDREW STILL ON THE PHONE. SHE'S NOT SHE'S. HELLO OKAY WELL THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT YES THEY CAN. THANK YOU I'M ATTEMPTING TO RECALL I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE SOME- OF THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS WITHIN THAT PROVISION THAT WE DID TRY TO TIGHTEN UP. DURING THE DISCUSSION AND THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE AMENDMENTS WHICH I BELIEVE YOU HAVE. TAKEN YES I'M SORRY I CAN'T RECALL IT RIGHT AT THE MOMENT. BUT I KNOW THAT THAT WAS PART OF OUR DISCUSSION. PERHAPS A. I DID YEAH OKAY SO I BELIEVE THE DAD THAT PROFICIENT WE STRENGTHEN THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THAT THE ATTESTATION IF YOU WILL HAVE TO BE FROM ANOTHER PARTY- AND THAT IT WAS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL SERVING AS THE TESTATOR IS THERE SUCH A TESTATOR AT ANY RATE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL WHO IS SEEKING THE ABILITY TO WITHDRAW FROM THE TENDENCY IT CANNOT DO SO INDEPENDENTLY WITHOUT OTHER CORROBORATION. I BELIEVE THAT'S WHERE WE LEFT IT AND WE ALSO DID TIGHTEN UP SOME OF THOSE OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHOSE STATEMENTS WOULD BE ACCEPTED AS THE SIGNET A SUFFICIENT. SO I DON'T HAVE A THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. YES THANK YOU ARE A VICTIM OF VIOLENT CRIME YES A VICTIM OF VIOLENT CRIME ADVOCATE AND AN ADVOCATE TO HAS- IS PART OF THE- OF. COURSE WHICH IS THE OR A- AN ENTITY THAT IT THAT IS KNOWN TO BE A VALID AND TODAY IT'S YOU JUST CAN'T PUT YOUR NAME NEXT SOMETHING HAS TO BE AN EXISTING LEGITIMATE ACCEPTED. ORGANIZATION RECOGNIZED YES. YES SENATOR OR DID YOU ASK HIM ANYTHING ELSE CENTER ON BURKE NO OKAY CENTER START OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I JUST HOPE I'M TRYING TO GET CLARITY APOLOGIES FOR NOT. UNDERSTANDING THIS MORE THOROUGHLY IN ADVANCE BUT- THE FIRST SECTION OF THE BILL IS ABOUT. THIS OTHER CLASS OF THIRD OF AFFILIATED THAT FAMILY MEMBER TO TENNIS BUT THE BUT THE AUTHORIZATION FOR ENFORCEMENT IS APPLIES ACROSS THE BOARD REPLY OKAY SUIT CAN YOU JUST COMMENT ON THE HISTORY THE PROVISION FROM LAST YEAR AND THAT. THE NOTION THAT WE SORT OF WE WORKED ON ALL THESE DETAILS OF ENFORCEMENT ALREADY AND WHAT WHAT YOU FEEL IS REALLY LACKING IN THE CURRENT ENFORCEMENT FRAMEWORK THAT JUSTIFIES THIS EXPANSION WELL I WASN'T YOU KNOW IN THE BACKGROUND OF PUTTING THAT BILL TOGETHER BUT I CERTAINLY SUPPORTED IT BECAUSE- BEING ABLE TO HAVE THAT KIND OF PROTECTION WITH JUST BECAUSE WE HAD DISCUSSED IT AND I HAD A- A BILL MYSELF- WHAT WE FOUND AND WHAT WE'VE- HEARD BACK IS. THAT THE IDEA OF HAVING TO GO TO THE TURN ATTORNEY GENERAL MADE IT MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR A TENANT- TO BE ABLE TO ASSERT THIS NEW THESE NEW RIGHTS OF THESE NEW PROTECTIONS AND SO DOING THAT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- FACILITATED THAT- AND WAS JUST. MUCH MORE EFFICIENT TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT THING GOING TO THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. THE JUST TO CLARIFY IS IT PURELY. IT'S PURELY ADMINISTRATIVE OR HAVE THE ACTUAL FINES AND PENALTIES CHANGE THEMSELVES AND MORE THE VAN YOU THINK THAT. THAT THE CITY ATTORNEY. OR DISTRICT ATTORNEY OR COUNTY COUNCIL CAN DO THIS ENFORCEMENT OR DO WE ACTUALLY CHANGE THE. THE LEVEL OF FINES OR PENALTIES. EIGHTY TWO FRAMEWORK BY THE WAY SIR I SHOULD I SHOULD BE ABLE TO. IS BRIAN AUGUSTA STILL ON THE LINE. I AM OKAY BRIAN BARGER. YES PLEASE YOU COULD YOU ANSWER THE LAST QUESTION THE ANSWER. YES THE ANSWER THE CENTERS QUESTION IS THAT IT DOES ADD A NEW PROVISION THAT WHAT AUTHORIZED. ADDITIONAL PROSECUTION OR LEVY FINES UP TO TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. CHOSE TO IMPLEMENT WHAT THE STATE AUTHORIZED THEM. KAREN SO EXISTING LAWS HAS A LESSER FINE OR RESTITUTION IN. WELL RIGHT NOW THERE'S ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM AND CURRENT LAW IS GENERALLY OF THE SENATE AS THE AUTHOR OF THAT THAT WILL BE WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR MAYBE UNDER SOME OTHER THEORY- ANOTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL LIKE THAT SHOULD BE ATTORNEY OR DISTRICT ATTORNEY CAN IN FOR SOME PORTIONS OF THE LAW BUT IS GENERALLY SOMETHING FORCING RESPECT TO A TENANT WHO WOULD RAISE THESE ISSUES AND THE FANS AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- AND IN DIFFERENT AND I'M OFF A PAIR OF ONE OF. THE THINGS THAT HAVE COME OUT. HE IS HOW DO YOU GET OUT SOME OF THE CRACK THAT OCCUR THE LOCAL WHERE. THAT BEING THE ONLY DEFENSE. IS OUT OF TO CRACK. BY LANDLORDS. A TENANT REALLY DID NOT AND POSITION TO STOP AND SO I THINK THE CON HERE IS. TO ALLOW GOVERNMENTS TO DO THAT AND HAVE SOME OF THE REMEDIES THAT THE- SEPARATELY WOULD ALLOW. I'M TO BETTER IN COME WITH THE LOCAL WHERE THEY KNOW THE PRACTICES THAT ARE GOING ON THAT YOU THAT LEVEL ENFORCEMENT. OKAY THANK YOU VERY TO YOU FOR THE CLERK I JUST THE THAT THAT THOSE FINAL CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD I SHOULD THE MY DILIGENCE BITTERNESS BUT- AYE AYE I STRONGLY SUPPORT THE FIRST SECTION ON IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT CENTER BUT- I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE DEAL STRUCK LAST YEAR IN THOSE FINAL PROVISION SO MANY I WANT TO JUST KEEP AN EYE ON HOW THAT LOOKS BEFORE THE FLOOR. THANK YOU THANK YOU GET. ALL RIGHT OF ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS- I THINK THE TO DO LIST THIS BILL DOES REFLECT THE NEED. MY EXPERIENCE WITH UNLAWFUL DETAINER ACTIONS IS THEY AREN'T AS A MEDIA. AS THE NEED IS THAT THEY CAN TAKE MONTHS I KNOW LA COUNTY IT'S NOTORIOUS. WITH THE SITUATION- THAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED UNDER COVERT NINETEEN WHEN THE COURTS TO GET BACK ALL THEY'RE GOING TO BE DOING IS CRIMINAL CASES OF FOR MONTHS IF NOT YEARS BECAUSE OF THIS BACKLOG. UNLAWFUL DETAINER ACTIONS WILL BE LACKING IN THE THEORY IS THAT THEY ARE IMMEDIATELY ENFORCEABLE AND IF THAT WERE THE CASE I THINK THAT MY CREATED DIFFERENT SITUATION BUT THAT IS NOT THE REALITY SHOW. WITH THAT. OUR MARRIAGE IS LESS. MERIT BETTER FOR SOME SUSPECT AT ANY RATE I'M SORRY SENATOR BOARD JUST HAS HIS HAND RAISED SENATOR BORCHERS MY APOLOGIES FOR PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU IF YOU CAN HEAR ME YES INDEED THANK YOU- JUST COURT JESTER. JOINT CLARIFICATION SO I'M LOOKING AT THE BILL AND IN THE EXISTING LAW IT INDICATES THAT. ALL I CAN IT IS ELIGIBLE YOU THERE'S A RESTRAINING ORDER INSPECTION A AND THEN IT GOES ON SECTION BEING. REPORT BY EIGHT PEACE OFFICER. THAT THE TENANTS HAS FILED A REPORT. SURE EXISTING LAW IT INDICATES THAT A RECORD IS ALL THAT'S NEEDED. AND THEN MOVING INTO THE NEW SECTION. OF. SUBSECTION SIX. THAT A CRIME THAT CAUSED PHYSICAL INJURY OR EMOTIONAL INJURY. I GUESS I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT. COULD THIS BE ABUSE BY INDIVIDUALS WISHING TO RELOCATE OR TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES TO CANCEL OUT ON A LEASE WHETHER THEY'RE COHABITANTS OR IN PARTNERSHIP IN SOME FASHION. COULD THIS BE ABUSE INSTEAD IS MY QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR UNDER A SCENARIO WHERE. ONE PARTY. FILES A REPORT. THAT SOUNDS WISE ONE SECTION IN ALLEGES EMOTIONAL INJURY. AND BY VIRTUE OF THOSE TWO OCCURRENCES ARE LEAST IS CAN BE BROKEN- THEREAFTER THE AUTHORED THROUGH THE CHAIR OUR- COMMENTS ON WHETHER THIS COULD BE USED GIVEN THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE. SOME ALL ENCOMPASSING LANGUAGE. IF I MAY ARM IF YOU LOOK AT A AMENDMENT ONE. IT TO IT TIGHTENS UP OF THE LANGUAGE WITH RESPECT TO CRIMES AND IT ALSO REMOVES EMOTIONAL INJURY. SO THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT CREATE A CLARITY. JOE MOTIONAL INJURY- OR THREAT OF PHYSICAL INJURY WERE TAKEN OUT. OF IT INCLUDES NOW A CRIME THAT CAUSED BODILY INJURY OR DEATH A CRIME THAT INCLUDED THE EXHIBITION DRAWING BRANDISHING OR USE OF A FIREARM OR OTHER DEADLY WEAPON- INSTRUMENT. A CRIME THAT INCLUDED THE USE OF FORCE AGAINST THE VICTIM OR THE THREAT OF FORCE AGAINST THE VICTIM SO WE HAVE SPECIFIED MADE IT MUCH CLEARER. IN REMOVED THE EMOTIONAL DISTRESS ASPECT. OKAY THAT'S HELPFUL TO KNOW AND THEN BUT THE EXISTING PROVISION IS THAT ONLY A REPORT NEEDS FILED WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. NOT THAT IT THE THREAT WAS TEAMS UBER OCCURRED. I AM NOT SURE THAT THAT WE THAT I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION BUT BASICALLY WHEN YOU FILE A POLICE REPORT IF YOU FILE A FRAUDULENT POLICE REPORT THAT IS A FELONY. SO AT LEAST FOR THE LAST TIME I LOOKED SO OR AT THE VERY LEAST SHOULD TO CRIME TO DO THAT SO- AGAIN WE'RE TRYING TO LIFT UP BAR SO IT ISN'T JUST HE SAID SHE SAID THERE HAS TO BE SOME DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT ACTION TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO THAT CLAIM. OF WHETHER IT'S SIR CRIME HAVING BEENCOMMITTED WHETHER IT'S- ALLEGATIONS. IF YOU GO TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT WITH THEM AND YOU FILE A COMPLAINT. THAT THE BIT IF THAT ISN'T ARE IN AND OF ITSELF IS A SERIOUS ACT WITH SIGNIFICANT LEGAL CONSEQUENCES IF IT IS FRAUDULENT WHICH I THINK PROTECT YOUR CONCERN.THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION.
