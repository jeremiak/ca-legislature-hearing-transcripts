WE WILL HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION AND OTHERS ABOUT THE WORK TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF COVERT NINETEEN IN STATE PRISONS AND WHAT HAS OCCURRED DURING THE FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS. SINCE THE EARLIER SENATE HEARING ON THESE TOPICS. ALSO IN TODAY'S SECOND PANEL WE WILL BE HEARING FROM THE CDC OUR STAFF AND ADVOCATES BUT THE TRANSFERS OF SOME PRISONERS TO IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT FACILITIES. INCLUDING THE PORT OF CALL IS BEING USED ON SUCH TRANSFERS OCCUR. NO OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY ARE BEING ADEQUATELY PROTECTED WHEN THE STATE CONTINUES TO TRANSFER SOME PRISONERS SCHEDULED FOR LEASE. TO ICE DETENTION CENTERS INSTEAD OF RELEASING THEM UPON COMPLETION OF THEIR SENTENCES. NOW I WISH TO. ALLOW THE CHAIRS OF THE RESPECTIVE COMMITTEES TO. REPS GIVE OPENING REMARKS- IS SENATOR SKINNER ON YET SO I'D FIRST LIKE TO ASK A CENTER SKINNER WHO SERVES AS CHAIR OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. TO MAKE SOME BRIEF OPENING REMARKS AT THIS TIME CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU SO MUCH DOCTOR PAN FOR CHAIRING AND GOOD AFTERNOON AND VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS A JOINT HEARING WITH NOT ONLY THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE BUT ALSO OUR PANDEMIC- I MERGING SHE RESPONDS COMMITTEE. SO WE KNOW THAT ONCE THE VIRUS. WHAT THE FIRST INCIDENCES OF THE VIRUS IN OUR STATE PRISONS IT SPREAD RAPIDLY AND THAT SPREAD WHILE THERE WERE MANY ACTIONS THAT WERE TAKEN SUCH AS STOPPING THE TRANSFER FROM US FOLKS WHO WERE IN COUNTY JAIL INTO THE STATE PRISON SO WE WERE NOT CREATING TRANSMISSION THAT WAY. ALSO DOING A VARIETY OF THINGS TO TRY TO LIMIT THE REALITY IS THAT THERE ARE SO MANY STAFF WITHIN OUR STATE FACILITIES THAT GO IN AND OUT IN FACT AND A DAILY BASIS. THAT WE HAVE SEEN AND CONTINUE TO SEE IT UNFORTUNATELY VERY RAPID SPREAD OF THIS VIRUS WITHIN OUR STATE FACILITIES AND NOW THAT WE HAVE GREAT THESE VERY SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF VIRUS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AT HIGHER NUMBERS PER DAY AND WE HAVE SEEN EVEN AT THE PEAK. WE ARE LIKELY TO SEE SIMILAR WITHIN OUR FACILITIES- AND I THINK THAT WHILE- NO THAT WAS NOT OUR PRIMARY. REASON FOR GOING HEARING WE REALLY WANTED TO DO OVERSIGHT ON THIS IN GENERAL I THINK WE REALLY DO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE FACT THAT. IT IS SEARCHING THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND IT REQUIRES A WHOLE I FEEL A WHOLE NEW LEVEL OF DILIGENCE AND PERHAPS NEW PROTOCOLS ARE ACTIONS TO PROTECT THOSE PEOPLE THAT WE HOLD IN OUR STATE FACILITY SO I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM. THE PANELISTS FROM THE PUBLIC- TO GIVE US THE ABILITY TO FIGURE OUT IF WE ARE TAKING THE APPROPRIATE STEPS OR WHAT OTHER STEPS WE MIGHT MAKE AND THEN I KNOW IN THE SECOND PANEL WE ARE OF COURSE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT. THAT THERE ARE STILL. TRANSFERS TRANSFERS AND OF COURSE THOSE TRANSFERS ARE ALSO VERY DANGEROUS IN RELATIONSHIP TO SPREADING THE VIRUS SO I LOOK FORWARD TO- THERE THE COMMENTS AND REMARKS AND TO OUR DIALOGUE AS LEGISLATORS. AS TO WHAT WE DO TO MINIMIZE THIS SPREAD M. D. DEATHS THAT RESULT POTENTIALLY THANKS VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A CENTER SKINNER I WOULD NOW LIKE TO INVITE TO CENTER GONZALEZ WHO CHAIRS THE SPECIAL PANDEMIC EMERGENCY RESPONSE COMMITTEE TO ALSO MAKE ANY OPENING REMARKS- CENTER GONZALEZ. THANK YOU SENATOR CAN AND THANK YOU TO SENATOR SKINNER AS WELL AS OUR COLLEAGUES HERE ON THE WELL THINK ABOUT THE PUBLIC SAFETY AND A PANDEMIC EMERGENCY RESPONSE COMMITTEE. I'M GLAD WE'RE HAVING THIS- DISCUSSION TODAY- ENTITIES HEARING IS IMPORTANT IN ORDER TO BRING FOCUS OF COURSE ON PREVENT TEEN THE SPREAD OF COVERT NINETEEN AS MENTIONED. IN A CALIFORNIA PRISON SYSTEM IMMIGRANT DETENTION CENTERS AND SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES AS WELL- I AM ALSO DEEPLY CONCERNED ALONG WITH- MY SENATE COLLEAGUES IN THE MIDST OF THIS PANDEMIC THE IMMIGRANTS SPECIFICALLY WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO BE RELEASED. FROM LOCAL AND STATE CUSTODY CONTINUE TO BE TRANSFERRED TO ICE DETENTION FACILITIES WHERE WE KNOW THAT THE VIRUS CAN IN SOME INSTANCES. INSTANCES ARE SPREADING VERY VERY QUICKLY AND KILLING- MANY CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS- SO WE KNOW THAT THIS IS HAPPENING AND IT'S HAPPENING IN OUR STATE WE HAVE TO GET CLEAR THE ROLES RESPONSIBILITIES AS TO WHO EXACTLY. AND WHY EXACTLY- THIS IS STILL OCCURRING IN OUR STATE. AND THERE ARE LOTS OF MEDIA REPORTS THAT ALSO INCLUDED THE- HORRENDOUS CONDITIONS IN THESE DETENTION FACILITIES TO WHICH WE NEED TO ADDRESS TODAY. SO WITH THAT I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU AGAIN MR I'D SHARE DOCTOR AND FOR- HOLDING THIS MEETING IN AND SHARING IN SACRAMENTO AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM. MANY OF THE PANELISTS STATE AGENCIES AND IMMIGRANT JUSTICE ADVOCATES AS WELL ON HOW WE CAN. FURTHER PREVENT THE SPREAD AS WELL AS RECTIFY THE SITUATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR GONZALEZ AND JUST ARE THERE ANY OTHER SENATORS WHO WISH TO MAKE A VERY BRIEF OPENING REMARKS BEFORE WE BEGIN OUR SPEAKERS. PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND FUTURE. OKAY SEEING NONE I WILL GO AHEAD OF BEGIN WITH FIRST PANEL- SO FAR IN FIRST PANEL EACH PALACE HAS. HAS UP TO FOUR MINUTES FOR THEIR PRESENTATIONS BUT I EXPECT- WITH FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS FROM OUR- COMMITTEE MEMBERS- YOU'LL HAVE EVEN MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO SPEAK MORE AT LENGTH AND AT THAT TIME- SO WE HAVE WILL BEGIN WITH DR JOSEPH. BECK DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF CORRECTIONAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES BUT CDC ARE WELCOME DOCTOR BACK- PLEASE BEGIN YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- IS MY SOUND OKAY ON YOUR END. SOUNDS GOOD. THANK YOU THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY REGARDING THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES EFFORTS. TO ADDRESS THE COMMON EPIDEMIC. I'M ESPECIALLY A PHYSICIAN WHO SPECIALIZES IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND I JOINED THE DEPARTMENT IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE AIDS EPIDEMIC. AFTER SERVING FOR APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE YEARS AT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL FACILITY. S. CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER AN INFECTIOUS DISEASES CONSULTANT. I ASSUME THE ROLE OF STATEWIDE DIRECTOR OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN JULY OF THIS YEAR. OVER THE PAST NINE MONTHS THE DEPARTMENT HAS MPLEMENTED UNPRECEDENTED ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO CONCORD NINETEEN. THESE CHANGES HAVE BEEN INFORMED BY OUR MEDICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH LEADERSHIP AS WELL AS PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS SAID THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL. STANFORD AND UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY. AS MORE IS LEARNED ABOUT THE VIRUS WE CONTINUE TO MODIFY OUR PREVENTION RESPONSE STRATEGIES. CAN THE SITUATION CONTINUES TO EVOLVE RAPIDLY AS EVIDENCED JUST THIS PAST WEEK BY THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF TWO DIFFERENT VACCINES THAT APPEAR TO BE. AT LEAST 90% APPLICATIONS. VERY EARLY ON WE REALIZED THAT THE BIGGEST RISK FOR OUTBREAKS IN OUR FACILITIES CAME FROM INTRODUCTION OF CORBETT NINETEEN BY EMPLOYEES CONTRACTORS VOLUNTEERS AND VISITORS. OUR EARLY STEPS TO CONTROL THESE RISKS INCLUDING LIMITING ENTRY TO THE PRISONS TO ONLY ESSENTIAL STAFF. MANDATING FACE COVERINGS AND JUST PHYSICAL DISTANCING FOR OUR EMPLOYEES AND INMATES. IMPLEMENTING ROUTINE GATE SCREENING PROBLEMS ENTERING THE FACILITY AND PROVIDED PROVIDING ONGOING COVERT EDUCATION TO OUR STAFF AND FOR PATIENTS. ADDITIONAL SPECIFIC STRATEGIES AND PRACTICES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED INCLUDING HAVE INCLUDED REDUCING NONESSENTIAL MOVEMENT. EXPANDING OUR CODED TESTING CAPACITY AND REDUCING TURNAROUND TIME SO THAT WE RECEIVE MOST RESULTS WITHIN TWO DAYS. DEVELOPING SEVERAL ELECTRONIC TOOLS TO TRACK OUR TESTING IN TRANSFER AND RELEASE INFORMATION AND MONITOR OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR CARE AND CONTINUALLY UPDATING OUR ONLINE PROGRAM GUIDELINES. IN RESPONSE TO EARLIER CORBETT OUTBREAKS CAUSED BY TRANSFERS OF PATIENTS FROM ONE INSTITUTION TO ANOTHER% WE ADDED STRINGENT PRE AND POST TRANSFER TESTING AND QUARANTINE REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL PATIENTS. WE ALSO MANDATED THE USE OF N. NINETY FIVE MASKS FOR ALL INMATES IN PATIENTS AND STAFF DURING OUR TRANSPORTATION. IN UTILIZING THESE REVISED TRANSFER PROTOCOLS WE'VE SAFELY TRANSFERRED OVER SEVEN THOUSAND PATIENTS BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS WITHOUT INCIDENT. R. INMATE AND STAFF TESTING PROTOCOLS WERE DEVELOPED IN CONSULTATION WITH CDPH AND THEY CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AS WE LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS VIRUS. THIS FREQUENCY OF TESTING IS BASED UPON JOB CLASSIFICATION NUMBER OF CASES IN THE INSTITUTION RESULTS OF OUR SURVEILLANCE TESTING. AND THE MISSION AT THE PRISON. R. OUTBREAKS AT SAN QUENTIN AND FOLSOM TAUGHT US THAT THIS VIRUS IS SPREAD BY AIRBORNE TRANSMISSION. SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE CDC UNTIL OCTOBER FIFTH OF THIS YEAR. WE ALSO LEARN THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST RISK FACTORS FOR SPREAD WITHIN OUR INSTITUTION WAS HOUSING IN DORMS OR STYLES WITH OPEN STOREFRONTS. IN RESPONSE WE CREATED A UNIQUE COM AT RISK SCORE SYSTEM WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT EACH INDIVIDUAL PATIENT SPECIFIC RISK PROSPEROUS NATION. AND DEATH IN THE EVENT THAT THEY BECOME INFECTED WITH COLD IT. ALL OF OUR PATIENTS ARE ASSIGNED A COLLUDED RIS ORDERS% BEEN CALCULATED BASED UPON. FACTORS SUCH AS AGE OBESITY AND LUNG DISEASE. AND USING THIS SCORING SYSTEM DURING THE PROCESS OF OFFERING MOVEMENT OUT OF DORMS IN INTO CLOSED CELL FRONT HOUSING TO ALL PATIENTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ELEVATED. HOLDEN RISK WORSE AFTER BECOME THAT ASK YOU TO WRAP UP SHORTLY. CERTAINLY OTHER SPECIFIC STEPS THAT WE TOOK INCLUDED STRINGENT OVERSIGHT OF OUTBREAKS OF THE INSTITUTION BY DAILY PHONE CALLS CONSULTING WITH THE PRISM OFFICE THE COLEMAN SPECIAL MASTER NOR CORTEX BURKE TRY QUARANTINE SPACE THROUGHOUT OUR FACILITIES AND PLANNING FOR THEIR COMMUNITY BAXI SO TO CONCLUDE WE CONTINUE TO FACE ENORMOUS CHALLENGES TO THE UNPRECEDENTED NATURE OF THIS AND THIS OPERATE. IT'S AIRBORNE TRANSMISSION ARE HOUSING FACILITIES THEY'RE OFTEN NOT CONDUCIVE TO PROTECTING VULNERABLE PATIENTS AS POINTED OUT BY SENATOR SKINNER THIS IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE LACK OF ADHERENCE IN THE FREE COMMUNITIES FACE COVERING AND PHYSICAL DISTANCING RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH IS RESULTING IN. THIS CURRENT STATEWIDE SEARCH. SO THREE OR PRIMARY. CLINICAL STRESS FROM FOR INCLUDE. MOVING ALL OVER HIGH RISK PATIENTS TO THE SAFEST AVAILABLE HOUSING. ENFORCING EVEN MORE VIGOROUSLY OUR PHYSICAL DISTANCING AND FACE COVERING DIRECTORS AND INTENSIFYING HER PREPARATION FOR A VACCINE DISTRIBUTION OKAY. THANK YOU AND I'M AVAILABLE FOR ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU DOCTOR BACK- NEXT WILL HAVE CONNIE GIPSON DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS AT CDC ARE WELCOME. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRS AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION AND OUR EFFORTS AND WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW AND WHAT WE'RE PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE AS WE WORK THROUGH. THIS COBIT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. FIRST I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU WE HAVE UNDERGONE THE BIGGEST REDUCTION IN PRISON POPULATION IN RECENT HISTORY. AND WE'VE DONE SO IN A MANNER THAT ENSURES PUBLIC SAFETY AS OF NOVEMBER TWELFTH TWENTY TWENTY CCAR'S M. INSTITUTIONS IN CAMP. HAD A POPULATION OF NINETY TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE. THIS IS A 20% REDUCTION FROM GREEK HOPE IT TIMES BETWEEN JULY FIRST THROUGH NOVEMBER SIXTEENTH CDC ARE AT LEAST OVER TWENTY ONE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS AND AGAIN THAT WAS A COMBINATION OF THOSE RELEASED ON THEIR NATURAL AS WELL AS A RESULT OF OUR EARLY RELEASE PROGRAMS THAT WE IMPLEMENTED. AS WELL AS THOSE WHO WERE IMPACTED BY THE TWELVE WEEK A POSITIVE PROGRAM CREDITS THAT WE IMPLEMENTED IN JULY. ADDITIONALLY CDCR CONTINUES TO PROCESS EARLY RELEASES ON A ROLLING BASIS THROUGH THE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAY RELEASE PROGRAM. THESE RELEASES HAVE HELP TO MAXIMIZE. PHYSICAL DISTANCING IN OUR PRESENTS AND HELP US A GREAT IN ISOLATION APPOINTING SPACE AS WE WORK TOWARDS- YES IN THE STATE'S SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION WE RESULT IN TAKE FROM COUNTY JAILS IN A SAFE AD CONTROLLED MANNER. JAIL INTAKE INITIALLY RESULT MAY TWENTY NINTH BUT THEY'LL STOP JUNE TWENTY NINE IT A POSITIVE CASES COMING INTO THE SYSTEM. WE AGAIN RESULT IN TAKE ON AUGUST TWENTY EIGHTH AS WE GET TO A DOCTOR BIG JUST SPOKE ABOUT PUT INTO PLACE OF PROTOCOL. AS IT RELATES TO THE EXPECTATION OF THE INDIVIDUALS. BEEN MEDICALLY CLEAR PRIOR TO TRANSFER. ONE NINETEEN AT TEN. PER TO TRANCE. THAT THE STAFF IN THE INMATES ON THE BUSES ARE IN IN NINETY FIVE JOINT TRANSPORTS. AND THEN WE COURT. TESTED PEOPLE AGAIN AND QUARANTINE THEM AND TEST AGAIN BEFORE RELEASE OF QUARANTINE. TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE MITIGATING THE INTRODUCTION OF CO THAT INTO OUR SYSTEM. SO FAR WE HAVE ACCEPTED APPROXIMATELY THIRTY THREE HUNDRED INMATES FROM THIRTY EIGHT COUNTIES SAYS RESUMPTION OF INTAKE. I DO WANT TO SHARE WE STILL HAVE A BACKLOG OF OVER EIGHT THOUSAND PERSONS WAITING TO COME COUNTY. FROM THE COUNTY JAILS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT SOME OF THE INDIVIDUALS AWAITING TRANSFER FROM COUNTY JAILS WILL BE RELEASED DIRECTLY FROM JAIL TO THE APPLICATION OF THE TWELVE WEEKS OTHER PROGRAMMING CREDITS. PEOPLE HOUSE IN THE COUNTY JAIL WHO WERE SENTENCED ON OR BEFORE JULY FIFTH. WILL RECEIVE EIGHTY FOUR DAYS A PPC AS LONG AS THEY WERE DISCIPLINARY FREE FROM MARCH FIRST THE JULY FIFTH TWENTY TWENTY. IT DOES HAVE AN ASTEROID PRISON PACKETS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN SENTENCED TO TWO YEARS OR LESS. AND WITH THESE INDIVIDUALS CASE RECORDS WILL CALCULATE A RELEASE DATE. USING THEIR SENTENCING DATE AS HER TERM DATE. BUT THOSE INDIVIDUALS SUCH AS TO TWO YEARS OR MORE THE BBC CREDITS WILL BE APPLIED AFTER THEY ARRIVE TO CDC ARE. ANOTHER STRATEGY THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON AS DR BIG TALKED ABOUT HIS MASS IMPORTS MET. AND TOBER TWENTY SEVEN CDC RSPCA YET ISSUED A REVISED MEMO ON MASS EXPECTATIONS. WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT OUR STAFF AWARE AND THEIR MASS ANYTIME THEY ARE NOT INSIDE A WALLED OFFICE TOWER CONTROL BOTH. FOR WITH THE ONLY EXCEPTION IS IF THEY'RE RESPONDING TO AN ALARM. THERE'S ALSO THE EXPECTATION THAT WE ARE HOLDING OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE AS WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE THE ONES WHO ARE BRINGING THIS INTO THE SYSTEM. AS OUR STAFF HAVE BEEN HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR NON COMPLIANCE. TO THE REST OF DISCIPLINARY PROCESS. I WAS JUST HAPPY BASS A PRISON YESTERDAY AND I TO LOOKING AT MASS. THE FINAL DEVELOPMENT I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE FOR YOU IS OUR ROADMAP TO RE OPENING SEC ACS AND SEIZE YOUR WORK TO RETURN A SENSE OF NORMALCY TO THE PRESIDENT'S. DECISIONS REGARDING WHEN AND HOW TO LIFT RESTRICTIONS WILL BE MADE AWFULLY AND ACCORDANCE WITH GUIDANCE WITH PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS. THE ROADMAP TO RE OPENING WAS DEVELOPED AS A MULTI PHASE MULTI DISCIPLINARY APPROACH. ELEMENT OPERATIONS TAKING IN CONSIDERATION CURRENT COVERT NINETEEN CASES IN INSTITUTIONS AND THE IMPACT OF PREVALENCE VEHICLE THAT IN THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY. AS WELL AS THE SAFETY AND SECURITY NEEDS OF THE INSTITUTIONS POPULATION WHILE BALANCING THE IMPORTANCE OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS VISITING AND ACTIVITIES TO THE WELL BEING OF THOSE INCARCERATED IN STATE PRISONS. AGAINST YOU TO PLEASE WRAP UP SHORTLY. I HAVE- CURRENTLY INTEGRATED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT PROGRAMS ARE HAPPENING AT THIRTY FOUR OR THIRTY FIVE PRESENTS- WITH TWENTY THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX INDIVIDUALS CURRENTLY INVOLVED WE CONTINUE TO RUN- WE HAVE PROGRAMS AS WELL AS CLASSROOMS TECHNICAL EDUCATION CLASSROOMS PRODUCTS CLASSROOMS EITHER THROUGH CORRESPONDENCE- ENDS. THIRTY PACKAGES FOR FACE TO FACE AN SEO WHILE MAINTAINING PHYSICAL DISCIPLINE- WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR INNOVATIVE GRANT RECIPIENTS TO EXPAND THEIR PROGRAMS AND THE DEPARTMENT IS LOOKING TO EXPAND- PROGRAM IN WHICH WE CAN. DO BRAG EARNING CREDITS FOR A REMOTE LEARNING IN ADDITION WE RECOGNIZE THAT IN PERSON VISITATION IS IMPORTANT PART OF REHABILITATION BUT IN CONSULTATION WITH CDPH CCAC ADDS. TO THE RISING NUMBER OF KOBE CASES THROUGHOUT THE STATE CDCR WILL NOT BE DONE IN PERSON VISITING AT ANY TIME SO PLEASE ARAMBULA WORKING DILIGENTLY TO LAUNCH VIDEO VISITING AT OUR PRESENCE STARTING WITH FIVE BY THE END UP BY THANKSGIVING. THANK WEDNESDAY I AM C. C. W. YOU'LL CREEK AND VALLEY WITH THE REST OF THE PRISONS COMING ON BOARD BY CHRISTMAS VIDEO VISITATION WILL BE FREE TO FAMILIES WHO CAN USE THEIR OWN DEVICES. TO CALL AND WHAT THE APPOINTMENTS. CLOSING YOUR SEE THAT ARE MAKING CHALLENGE AT INTO. FACING CHALLENGES AS WE'RE TRYING TO REDEFINE OUR NEW NORMAL. HEY THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS WHETHER DEPARTMENT IS AT A LOCAL MANY QUESTIONS OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE WILL BE TAKING QUESTIONS FROM SENATORS AT THE END OF THIS PANEL AND DEPRIVE YOU MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO SPEAK MORE AT LENGTH BUT I. DO ASK THAT. WE TRY TO STICK TO OUR TIME LIMIT. NEXT UP WE HAVE A JEANS KING. AND QUEEN THE ELEVATOR CENTER. AND THAT BE FORTY YOU'RE TALKING. THANK YOU. THANKS TO THE CHIU AND MEMBERS OF BOTH COMMITTEES FOR A LONG THE SPEAK IT AGAIN. SINCE I LAST GAVE TESTIMONY IN JULY REGARDING THE OUTBREAK IS SANTA WAS PANDEMIC IN OUR STATE PRISONS THANKS OF RUNNING RECENTLY WORSE NEED CDCR OFFICIALS NOR THE FEDERAL RECEIVER HAVE TAKEN SIMPLE STEPS NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE BASIC HEALTH NEEDS. OF INCARCERATED PEOPLE WITHIN OUR STATE. IN A FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS SINCE WE LAST SPOKE OVER TWELVE THOUSAND CARS THREE PEOPLE HAVE BECOME INFECTED CLOSE TO FIVE THOUSAND STAFF MEMBERS. OVER EIGHTY PEOPLE HAVE DIED. AS I WRITE THIS FIVE PRISONS ARE EXPERIENCING TRIPLE DIGIT SURGES IN CONFIRMED CASES. EVERYONE OF OUR STATE PRISONS HAS HAD AT LEAST ONE OUTBREAK. THE PEOPLE I SPEAK WITH INSIDE OF OUR PRISONS TELL ME THE PRISONS ARE STILL EXTREMELY OVERCROWDED CDCR HAS OVER NINETY TWO THOUSAND INCARCERATED PEOPLE CURRENTLY IN THE PRISONS THEMSELVES ARE STILL AT OVER ONE HUNDRED AND SIX MONTHS EARLY IS NOT IN THE MOVIE PEOPLE FROM THE MOST CROWDED PRISONS THE LAST OVERCROWDED PRISONS SIMPLY CREATES NEW POTENTIAL HOT SPOTS. CDC ARTS POLICY OF LIMITING PEOPLE'S ACCESS TO YOUR CURRENT AND FRESH AIR BASTILLE FORCED ME TO WORK IN THE AREAS THAT BRING THEM INTO CLOSE PROXIMITY WITH STAFF. INCREASES OUTBREAKS. RELEASES HAVE ACTUALLY SLOWED DUE TO A LACK OF PROGRAM BEGIN ABILITY TO EARN PROGRAMS EXPERTS. PEOPLE WANT TO SEE THEIR FAMILIES BUT ARE AFRAID VISITS WILL BE OVERLY PUNITIVE EVEN THOUGH INTERACTION WITH CORRECTIONAL STAFF REMAINS THE MOST LIKELY WAY TO BECOME INFECTED. IN RESPONSE TO THE DIRE CIRCUMSTANCES INCARCERATED PEOPLE THEIR FAMILIES IN FRONT NOT PRISON STAFF OR EXPERIENCING CDC OURS OFFICIALS ARE WORKING ON PLANS TO CONDUCT MORE TRANSFERS AND WE OPEN PRESENT PROGRAM. THE CDC ARE PLANNED SALES BECAUSE THERE IS NO SELF SAFE WAY TO PROTECT OVER NINETY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THIRTY FOUR PRISONS. IN CLOSING I'D LIKE TO GIVE UPDATES ON A FEW OF THE PEOPLE I MENTIONED AT OUR LAST MEETING. THRACO EIGHTY YEARS OLD. WITH MULTIPLE HEART PROBLEMS IS STILL INCARCERATED AT SAN QUENTIN. IT WAS NOT CONSIDERED FOR HIGH RISK MEDICAL RELEASE BECAUSE HE HAS AN INDETERMINATE SENTENCE. LONNIE MORRIS DIMITRIUS MING HE TOM WICKER AND GUESTS OF WENT AS ALL REMAIN IN PRISON EVEN THOUGH EACH OF HIGH RISK IN EACH SIGNED A RELEASE PLANTS. MY DEAR FRIEND GEROW WHO CONTRACTED BECAUSE OF IT. WHILE HE WAS BATTLING CANCER PASSED AWAY TWO WEEKS AFTER THE JULY HEARING. HE WAS NEVER CONSIDERED FOR A HIGH RISK MEDICAL RELEASE BECAUSE HE HAD AN INDETERMINATE SENTENCE. I'M HAPPY TO SAY PATRICIA RIGHT HAS BEEN RELEASED IN SPITE OF THE CANCER SHE CONTINUES TO FIGHT HE'S DEVOTING CONSIDERABLE TIME TO ADVOCATING FOR PEOPLE FROM. THE WOMEN'S PRISONS WHO ARE EQUALLY DESERVING OF RELEASE WOMEN LIKE MARIA OUT I DON'T KNOW AND YOU SEE A PROBLEM WE'RE STILL INCARCERATED BY BATTLING CANCER. BOTH BAILEY'S BROWN ANTHONY M. AS FAMILIES WERE INFORMED THEIR RELEASES WOULD BE EXPEDITED ONLY TO HAVE OFFICIALS HALT THEIR RELEASES AT THE LAST MOMENT CAUSING EMOTIONAL PAIN THAT IS STILL ON GOING. MANY PEOPLE INSIDE ARE EXCITED THAT THE LEGISLATOR LEGISLATURE REFORMED ELDERLY PAROLE TO INCLUDE PEOPLE WHO ARE FIFTY YEARS OF AGE NO BEEN INCARCERATED FOR TWENTY YEARS. UNFORTUNATELY THOSE WHO QUALIFY WILL HAVE TO WAIT SEVERAL MONTHS TO BE SCHEDULED FOR PAROLE HEARINGS SO I HOPE THE CDCR REFERS ELDERLY PRO CANDIDATES FOR RE SENTENCING IN THE COURTS OR THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. GRANSDEN CLEMENCY. MY FRIENDS IS OUT OF PRISON ARE UNIFIED IN THEIR BELIEF THE TRANSFERS ARE DANGEROUS. THEY LIVE THE POLICIES THAT CDCR IMPLEMENTS A NO BETTER THAN ANYONE THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF PROPOSED TRANSFERS. THE THINGS THEY ARE ASKING FOR A 1100% CONSISTENT WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS MEDICAL EXPERTS IN THE FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS WHICH IS CALLED THE CDC OUR RESPONSE THE SAN QUINN OUTBREAK. MORALLY UNTENABLE AND LEGALLY INDEFENSIBLE. IN RESPONSE CDCR STATED THE RESPONSE THAT OUTBREAK AT SAN QUENTIN WAS REASONABLE PLEASE WRAP UP SOON. ELDERLY PEOPLE WERE LACKING FOR MINOR CASES WHERE PEOPLE WERE CONFIRMED TO HAVE CALLED. OUR PRISONS ARE HOME TO SOME OF THE LARGEST CLUSTER OUTBREAKS IN THE WORLD BECAUSE CDCR REFUSES TO CONSIDER PEOPLE FOR HIGH RISK RELEASE IF THEY HAVE AN INDETERMINATE SENTENCE. RESPECTFULLY A PERSON SINCE HAS NO RELEVANCE UPON THEIR MEDICAL NEEDS IF THE FEDERAL RECEIVER AND CDCR DEEM THAT RESEMBLE TO MAKE THIS THE DETERMINING FACTOR. THEY'VE PROVEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN THEY CAN'T FOLLOW THEIR BASIC MANDATE OF KEEPING PEOPLE SAFE FROM COLD. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANKS FOR MUCH MISTER KING- AND FINALLY OUR LAST WITNESS ON THIS PANEL IS DOCTORS STEFANO. BUT DOES HE I HOPE I GOT THAT CORRECT. DEAN EMERITUS AND PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA BERKELEY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH. WELCOME. THANK YOU SENATOR IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE WITH YOU. I'M WAS ASKED TO SAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT UC BERKELEY AND UCSF I'VE BEEN DOING TOGETHER AS PART OF THE CODE IN CALIFORNIA PRISONS PROGRAM WHICH WE DO WITH THE AMEND PROGRAM AT UCSF AND SINCE THE LAST HEARING WHEN DR SEARS WAS WITH YOU WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON PREPARING AND DISSEMINATING EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS FOR RESIDENTS AND WORK FORCE IN OUR PRISONS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTING WEBINARS FOR CLINICIANS TO KEEP THEM APPRISED OF CODE NINETEEN TREATMENT BEST PRACTICES. THAT WE CONDUCTED AN ONSITE EVALUATION OF THE RESPONSE TO THE CODE THIRTEEN INTRODUCTION CODE NINETEEN INTRODUCTION EXCUSE ME AT- THE CALIFORNIA MEN'S COLONY BECAUSE IT WAS AN EXAMPLE OF A SUCCESSFUL CONTAINMENT OF AN OUTBREAK AND THAT COULD SERVE AS A BEST PRACTICE FOR OTHER PRISONS WE'VE BEEN PROVIDING TECHNICAL ADVICE TO THE CDC OUR LEADERSHIP ON AN AD HOC BASIS AND WE'RE STARTING NOW A NEW PROJECT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND COVERT NINETEEN TRANSMISSION WITHIN THE PRISONS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT NOT ONLY THE MITIGATION STRATEGIES THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED BUT ALSO THE PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF EACH PRESENT AND HOW THEY INCREASE OR DECREASE SUSCEPTIBILITY. TO TRANSMISSION. WHAT ARE OF OUR THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW TO PREPARE FOR THE NEXT PHASE OF THE UP. BUT OF THE PANDEMIC. NUMBER ONE. BUT JUST TO UNDERLINE WHAT WE JUST HEARD FROM MISTER KING. WE CONTINUE TO STRONGLY ADVOCATE FOR ACCELERATED RELEASE AND FOR LOW. THE RECENT EXPLOSIVE EPIDEMICS THAT WE'VE SEEN FOR EXAMPLE AT THE- CALIFORNIA SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT FACILITY AND OF HIGH DESERT. SHOW THAT WE CAN HAVE- NEW OUTBREAKS WITH HUNDREDS IN THE CASE OF THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT FACILITY ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED IN THE CASE OF HIGH DESERT. NO MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED JUST WITHIN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. BUT THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE IN LARGE CONGREGATE SETTINGS IN THE PRISONS. ARE NOT ABLE TO BE PROTECTED AND WE NEED MANY MORE PEOPLE TO BE RELEASED TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THOSE WHO MUST STAY INSIDE. SAFE FROM THESE KIND OF EXPLOSIVE. OUTBREAKS SECONDLY WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF COWORKING IMAGINE A NURSING HOME THAT INSTEAD OF HAVING A HUNDRED RESIDENTS HAD FOUR THOUSAND RESIDENTS. BY TAKING A PRISON A LARGE PRISON AND SUBDIVIDING IT SO THAT FUNCTIONALLY IT'S A NUMBER OF SMALLER PRISONS. YOU REDUCE THE ABILITY TO HAVE A SMALL OUTBREAK TURN INTO AN EXPLOSIVE OUTBREAK LIKE LIKE WE'VE SEEN IN SEVERAL PRISONS. WE NEED TO DO THAT BY KEEPING BOTH RESIDENTS AND STAFF. ASSIGNED TO THEIR MANY PRISON WITHIN THE PRISON. THE NOW. THIRDLY AS MENTIONED BY DOCTOR BACK WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE ADVENT OF THE NEW VACCINES IN THE EFFECTIVENESS THAT THEY SEEM TO HAVE. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT- CALIFORNIA PRISON STAFF AND RESIDENTS ARE PRIORITIZED FOR THE VACCINES THAT CALIFORNIA HAS ACCESS TO. MY WITH A SPECIALLY UNDERLINED THE NEED FOR STAFF TO BE VACCINATED BECAUSE AS WE'VE HEARD FROM OTHER SPEAKERS. IT'S STAFF WILL PROVIDE THE VEHICLE OF INTRODUCTION OF THE VIRUS INTO THE PRISONS. THAT GETS AMPLIFIED AND EXPLOSIVELY WITHIN THE PRISON AND THEN IS A DANGER TO THE COMMUNITY BOTH BECAUSE OF TRANSMISSION BACK OUT TO THE COMMUNITY. AND BECAUSE OF OVERWHELMING LOCAL HEALTH CARE RESOURCES. SO WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED THAT THERE SOMEBODY IS REPRESENTING CORRECTIONS ON THE GOVERNOR'S FAXING PREPOSITION TASK FORCE. AND WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE ACCEPTANCE OF VACCINATION AMONG BOTH- STAFF AND- RESIDENTS OF THE PRISONS AND SO WE THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WE WILL CONTRIBUTE TO WORKING WITH INMATES COUNCIL'S FAMILY COMMUNITY PARTNERS AS WELL AS THE UNIONS. TO TRY TO REDUCE ANY RELUCTANCE TO BE VACCINATED- IN THE CASE OF- THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SYSTEM WIDE WE HAVE RECENTLY INSTITUTED AN OBLIGATORY INFLUENZA VACCINATION POLICY I CAN'T GO TO CAMPUS IF I'M NOT BACK SENATE AGAINST INFLUENZA. AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE GOT A MINIMUM SHOULD DO THE SAME FOR THE STAFF AT WORKING IN OUR PRISONS BECAUSE WITH INFLUENZA AND HOPEFULLY SOON COVERT VACCINATION WILL BE ABLE TO PROTECT THE POPULATION IN THE PRISONS. ALMOST LASTLY I WANT TO MENTION. THAT DR BIG BIG MENTION THAT HE'S HAVING A BETTER TIME NOW WITH THE TURN AROUND TIME ON TESTS BUT THAT HAS BEEN A MAJOR PROBLEM. AND WITH THE SURGE IS HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA I'M VERY CONCERNED. THAT THE TURNAROUND TIME WILL FALL. IT'S INEXCUSABLE AROUND HAVE LONG TURNAROUND TIME FOR TESTING IT'S BETTER TO HAVE LESS TESTING IN THE COMMUNITY. THAT HAVE WEEK LONG TURNAROUND TIMES BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A LONG TURNAROUND TIME. YOU CAN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE RESULTS OF THE TEST TO INTERRUPT TRANSMISSION AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE DOING THE TESTING FOR. IN MOST CASES SO WE NEED IT BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT. THESE EPIDEMICS AND OUTBREAKS HAPPEN EXPLOSIVELY WITHIN PRISONS WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE THE PRISONS FOR RAPID RESPONSE- FROM THE TO THE TESTING SERVICES. THANK YOU CAN FINALLY I WANT TO MENTION SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED I WAS VERY VERY HAPPY TO HEAR TODAY ABOUT THE NEW TABLET PROGRAM WE'VE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR THAT. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE IN OUR PRISONS TO NOT LOSE CONTACT WITH THEIR FAMILIES TO MAINTAIN THEIR MENTAL HEALTH BUT ALSO TO MAINTAIN. THEIR COOPERATION WITH- PP AND- SOCIAL DISTANCING. AND SO- THE TABLET PROGRAM WILL GO A LONG WAY. BUT IT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING PUT INTO ISOLATION QUARANTINE. IN ORDER RATIONALE. FOR DOCTOR. LOOK FORWARD WHILE. WITH CENTER. AND TO REPORT EARLIER. WE NEED TO MAKE THAT WHAT WILL. TO THEM WHEN THAT HAPPENS ISOLATION QUARANTINE IS NOT PUNITIVE. BUT THEY WILL HAVE IF ANYTHING ENHANCED COMMUNICATION. WITH THEIR FAMILIES FOR PEOPLE ON THE OUTSIDE AND WITH THEIR FELLOW RESIDENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT WE HAVE- THAT I THINK ALL THE PRESENTERS- I SAID AS I MENTIONED EARLIER I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE EVEN MORE TIME FOR ELABORATION. AS MEMBERS LAST QUESTIONS- SO I NOW WILL TAKE MEMBER QUESTIONS FOR THOSE PARTICIPATING REMOTELY PLEASE USED TO RAISE YOUR HAND FEATURE- I SOMETIMES CAN'T TELL WHT ORDER PEOPLE DO THAT SO. PLEASE HAVE PATIENCE WITH ME WITH THAT IN TERMS OF WATER- I BELIEVE WE HAVE CENTER- MCGUIRE- DOES HAVE A QUESTION. SO WE'LL BEGIN WITH SENATE MCGUIRE. THANK YOU AYE I WOULD JUST HOPE THAT SENATORS WOULD BE ABLE TO AMUSE THEMSELVES- AND NOT HAVE- OPERATORS DO THAT THAT THAT WOULD BE A REQUEST AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN HEARINGS THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO. DIRECT YOUR QUESTION TO DIRECTOR GIPSON- AND IT SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO- DEL NORTE COUNTY I DON'T KNOW IF DIRECTOR GIPSON IS STILL ON THE LINE. THANK I AM. RIGHT A GESTURE GIPSON THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. GIPSON OKAY THAT WOULD ONLY SUCH ITEM ITEM. JUDGE GIPSON AT WOULD I HEARD YOU SAY THAT YOU UP AND DOWN COUNTY PELICAN BAY THANK YOU FOR MAKING THE TRAVELS UP NORTH AS WELL YESTERDAY. YES I'M BETTER DIRECTOR JUST A FEW ITEMS IN THIS IS COMING FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT IN I DON'T KNOW OUR COUNTY AND I JUST WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO TRACK DOWN THESE ANSWERS IN AND GET YOUR TAKE ON THEM ACCORDING TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT IN DELAWARE COUNTY THERE'S BEEN EVIDENCE THAT THE MANDATORY TESTING- THAT IS BEEN A DANCE IN THE PRISON HAS NOT BEEN ENFORCED CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT- IT HAS BEEN ENFORCEMENT INDIVIDUALS- THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO BE TESTED EACH WEEK- AND THAT IS OBVIOUSLY- I HAD A CONCERN. TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT BEING SUCH A SMALL COUNTY BUT I WANTED TO BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO COMMENT ON THIS AND THEN ALSO WOULD LOVE TO BE TO SET UP A CALL WITH THE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS THE COUNTY DOWN OR DIG DEEP I HAD TO DIG DEEPER INTO THESE ISSUES BUT AFTER GIPSON AND A FEW QUESTIONS BUT IF YOU DON'T MIND JUST IN THAT. FIRST IN REGARDS TO THE MANDATORY TESTING. SO I AM ASSUMING. HE'S ME TALKING ABOUT STAFF TO. OR A THE TEST. I BELIEVE IT'S- TEST. SO I KNOW WE'RE CONTINUALLY AS WE CONTINUE TO TEST OUR STOP EVERY TWO WEEKS- WE'VE RUN INTO STAFF WERE REFUSING TO TEST AND I KNOW WHEN I SPOTTED AWARD YESTERDAY HE SAID IT IS A CHALLENGE UP THERE BUT HE IS HOLDING A STAFF ACCOUNTABLE TO ENSURE THEY ARE COMPLIANT WITH TESTY SO IT CONTINUES TO BE AS DR BIG SPOKE ABOUT WE TALK ABOUT WITH THE INMATES OR STAFF POSTED EDUCATION BUT ALSO THERE'S AN EXPECTATION THAT OUR STOCK FOR TESTING WITH AND IT'S THE WHOLE REASON WHY WE PUT THE- TESTING PROGRAM INTO PLACE. SO I KNOW- IS. IS A CHALLENGE- BETTER IMAGES SOME OF IT YEAH. IS THERE A PERCENTAGE AND I'M MAKING THESE UP TO SIXTY FORTY OR FIFTY FIFTY DO WE KNOW WHAT THE PERSON IN CHARGE OF THOSE STAFF THAT ARE TESTED- IN COMPLIANCE IN THOSE WHO ARE NOT. ENATOR I DON'THAVE THAT INFORMATION BUT I CAN GLAD TO GET IT FOR YOU. I WOULD BE VERY MUCH. YEAH DEBBIE BUT YOU SHOULDN'T THANK YOU MADAM DIRECTOR THE OTHER PIECES. YOU HAD SAID THAT- HE HE SAW A LOT OF MASK WEARING AGAIN THERE'S SOME ONGOING CONCERNS ABOUT A LACK OF ENFORCEMENT- WITH MASK USED AROUND. THE PRISON AGAIN THIS IS NOT AND I GOTCHA BUT JUST WANTED TO SIMPLY HAVE THIS CONVERSATION SINCE YOU'RE HERE AND WOULD LOVE TO FOLLOW UP. SO YOU DO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ROBUST ENFORCEMENT. OF STAFF. TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE WEARING THEIR MASKS IN. AND AROUND THE PRISON IS THAT ACCURATE. HE AND I SAY WE EVEN FOCUS ON IT. I CAN SHARE WITH YOU WHAT I WAS UP TALKING TO THE WHARTON YESTERDAY. I MEAN ON TUESDAY BECAUSE I DROVE BACK YESTERDAY- HE'S HERE WITH ME THAT HE HAD DONE CORRECTIVE ACTION ONLY THIRTEEN EMPLOYEES. IN THE LAST WEEK OR SO. OR NOT COMPLIANCE WITH THE MASS ISSUE SO I CAN TELL YOU- WE CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THE STAFF UNDERSTAND IS NO DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER SAFETY EQUIPMENT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO WEAR. AND THERE'S AN EXPECTATION YOU WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR NON COMPLIANCE. THANK YOU MA'AM I. WOULD LIKE TO BE A- MOVE OVER TO CONTACT TRACING. MY UNDERSTANDING IS FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT IN DELAWARE COUNTY. THAT- THE PRISON IS ONLY PROVIDING POSITIVE NEGATIVE STATUS OF INDIVIDUALS BUT NOT PROVIDED THE INTERNAL CONTACT TRACING INFORMATION WHICH IS BEING CRITICAL ESPECIALLY IN SUCH A SMALL COMMUNITY WITH SUCH A LIMITED CAPACITY WHEN IT COMES TO- HOSPITAL FACILITIES THAT'S A CHALLENGE AS DATING THE COUNTY'S BEEN TRYING TO. ADVANCE A ROBUST CONTACT TRACING A PROGRAM DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT OR IS THAT AN ISSUE THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO GET TO GO OFFLINE ON. WE NEED TO GO OFF LINE- CONTACT TRACING RIGHT NOW IS BEING LED BY CCAC YES SO I DON'T KNOW A DOCTOR BIG MAY HAVE SOME RESPONSE OR WE MAY NOT NEED TO GET BACK TO YOU SENATOR. OKAY IT HAPPENED HERE FROM DOCTOR BACON THERE'S JUST ONE OTHER ITEM. MADRICK IN APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE WITH MY QUESTIONS- INTAKE YOU MISTER CHAIR ADVENTURES AS WELL. THE INDIANA KINDS IS WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A FURTHER CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS IS THERE BEEN DELAYS IN GETTING THE INFORMATION. TO PUBLIC HEALTH STAFF. ON ON THE CONTENT TREATING IT COULD TAKE DAYS MANY TIMES OVER A WEEK. TO BE ABLE TO GET THE INFORMATION. FROM CDC ARE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AT WHICH HAS DEEPLY HAMPERED THAT THAT THE CONTACT TRACING EFFORTS IN DELAWARE COUNTY. SO AGAIN MADAM DIRECTOR I'M NOT THROWN I GOTCHA QUESTIONS THAT IS WHEN- I PUT A PIN IN THIS ONE. AND THAT IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO. DETERMINE IS HOW. WE CAN EXPEDITE THOSE. RESULTS COMING BACK TO YOU- THE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THAT ROBUST CONTRACT TRACING PROGRAM BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO HEAR YOUR RESPONSE AT THIS TIME. AM I WOULD HAVE TO NEED TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT. THANK YOU SOME MORE INFORMATION UNLESS DOCTOR BIG MAYBE CAN SPEAK ON IT. THANK YOU MADAM DIRECTOR I'D THROUGH THE CHAIR IF IT'S ALRIGHT I HAD DOCTOR BIG JUST A QUICK RESPONSE IN MADAM DIRECTOR WILL BE FOLLOWING UP THANK YOU AGAIN. FOR YOUR RESPONSES- STARTER DECKS THANK TO PICK IF YOU COULD PLEASE. GIVE A RESPONSE. YES CENTER REQUIRE WE AGREE WITH YOU 1100% IN THESE- DAILY CALLS THATWE'RE HAVING WITH THE INSTITUTIONS WERE REINFORCING THE NECESSITY. THAT THE INSTITUTIONS COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. IN ALL EIGHTEEN COUNTIES WERE WE HAVE PRISONS AT LEAST WEEKLY. AND I MYSELF HAVE STARTED CALLS IN FACT THIS WEEK I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH DOCTOR REAL WALL FROM YOUR COUNTY. AND COMMITTED TO HIM AND HIS STAFF THAT WE WILL DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN. TO FACILITATE- IS MANAGEMENT OF CASES IN THAT COUNTY. PERFECT THAT'S GREAT A JUDGE WE NEED NOT TO BE ABLE TO INCLUDE YOU ON THIS- THAT WE DO HAVE A SCENE WHERE CDC ARE- IS WELL AS THE COUNTY YOU WOULDN'T MIND UNITED SHE- AT YOUR PROACTIVE NATURE WITH DOCTOR RAY WHILE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER. UP IN JAIL OR CAN I MISTER JR THANK YOU DR BIG MADAM DIRECTOR THANK THE FOR FOLLOWING NEXT WEEK. THANK SIR MCGUIRE. SO JUST A FOR DEPENDING OF THE OTHER MEMBERS I WILL NEXT GO TO CENTER GONZALEZ AND THEN I'LL HAVE CENTERS SKINNER CAPPIELLO BRADFORD IN JACKSON SO THAT'S THE ORDER I HAVE. FOR RIGHT NOW. A SERVER GONZALEZ. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR THIS FIRST PANEL- I WANT TO START MY QUESTIONS ARE DIRECTED TO- DIRECTOR BAKER GIPSON- THE FIRST QUESTION IS RELATIVE TO. IN SOME WAYS WHAT US SENATOR MCGUIRE HAD ASKED AS WELL ABOUT- THE FACE COVERINGS AND SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HADN'T BEEN. BETTER WORK ARE BEING WORKED ON RIGHT NOW ARE IN PROGRESS. I KNOW THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL RECENTLY ISSUED THEIR FINDINGS JUBILEE WAS NOVEMBER TENTH SYSTEMS YOU KNOW. NOT TOO LONG AGO- THAT ADDRESS MANY OF THESE ISSUES. FEES COVERING DIRECTIVES AT TWENTY THREE OF THE THIRTY FOUR PRISONS THEY VISITED DID NOT. HAVE DIRECTIVES. THEY ALSO DOWN FAILURE TO COMPLETE SOCIAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS VETERANS CETERA. MY QUESTION IS WHAT NEXT STEPS IF ANY WILL CDCR TO TAKE TO RESPOND TO THOSE AND THEN SECOND TO THAT I KNOW OUR DIRECTOR GIPSON HAD MENTIONED. A ROAD MAP TO RE OPENING SO. WOULD THAT NEED TO BE UPDATED AS WELL. SO IN RESPONSE TO THE- I OFFER OF HIS GENERAL SUPPORT THERE WAS A CLARIFICATION MEMO THAT WAS SENT OUT JOINTLY BY THE RECEIVER AND THE SECRETARY. THAT GAVE CLEAR EXPECTATIONS OF MASS WHERE FOR OUR EMPLOYEES. ADDITIONALLY AS I STATED EARLIER- CDCR CCAC AS EXECUTIVE STAFF YES MY TRIP THE PELICAN BAY IN MY OTHER PRESENTED TO RECENTLY. WE ARE OUTDOOR SPOT CHECKS AND- UNANNOUNCED VISITS TO THOSE PRESENTS TAT GO OUT THERE AND LOOK AT MASS COMPLIANCE. AS WELL AS THE EXPECTATION THAT THE WARDENS AND THEIR MANAGEMENT TEAMS I KNOW BACK TO BACK WILL SAY THE CEO THAN THEIR TEAMS. OUT THERE WALKING LOOKING AT AT. THE MASTER PLANNED SOCIAL DISTANCING REVIEWS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE HOLDING OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE AND- SO THAT WE HAVE A COMFORT LEVEL THAT. PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT MASS COMPLIANCE SOCIAL DISTANCING COMPLIANT- WE ARE WORKING. COLLECTIVELY DEVELOP A- TRACKING DOT THAT WILL US BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE AND SHOW. THE EMPLOYEES WHO ARE HAVING TO BE ADDRESSED ON THESE ISSUES WHAT ACTION HAS TAKEN PLACE WHETHER THIS IS A REPEAT OFFENDER AND THEN THE ACTION SHOULD BE ELEVATED AS WE CONTINUE TO THE PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE. PROCESS WE TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY OUR OBLIGATION TO TRY TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE MAKING THE WORK ENVIRONMENT A STATE THAT WE CAN NOT ONLY FOR THE POPULATION WE SERVE BEFORE OUR STAFF THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS TO COMMUNITIES THEY LIVE IN. AND SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE I KNOW WE'RE ALSO IN THE MIX AND UP PROCESS AND- WE BY SEEN ANOTHER MASS MEMO THAT WALTER STAFF ABOUT THE TYPE OF MATH THAT EVERYBODY WE- ARE TO WEAR. SO THERE'S SOME OTHER THINGS TO THAT ARE IN THE WORKS. TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR EXPECTATIONS OF THAT AGENCY OR OUT THERE ABOUT MATH COMPLIANCE. AND IN THE ROADMAP TO RE OPENING QUESTION I'M SORRY. YES I HAD JUST ASKED. ME- TO STRANGER GIPSON IF THAT NEEDS TO BE UPDATED GIVEN ALL THESE CLARIFICATION MEMOS AND GET IT. ASIDE FROM JUST MASK WEARING THEIR WORK- QUITE A FEW- ISSUES LISTED IN THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT. AND HOW THAT WOULD BE A DRESSER THAT NEEDS TO IS IF THE ROAD MAP TO RE OPENING NEEDS TO BE UPDATED GIVEN THIS- NEW INFORMATION. SO I THINK A COUPLE OF THINGS I'M NOT. SURE IT NEEDS TO BE THE ROADMAP TO RE OPENING BECAUSE A ROADMAP TO RE OPENING REALLY DEALS WITH HOW ARE WE GOING TO BRING. HOW DO WE DEFINE OUR NEW NORMAL PROCESS FOR THE PRISONS GETTING PROGRAM BACK TO OUR POPULATION WHO BEEN OUT. THEN WENT OUT. AND MANY PROGRAMS VISITING THAT TYPE OF THING FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NOW. BUT IT HAS. CHANGED THE WAY WE DONE OUR SCREENING PROCESS WHERE WE- EVERY INSTITUTION HAS HAD. TO ENSURE THAT THEIR SCREENING LOCATION WHERE STAFF ARE BEING SCREENED EVERY DAY BEFORE THEY COME INTO THE PRESIDENT **** SYMPTOMS QUESTION A TEMPERATURE CHECK IS DONE. THAT EVERY STAFF PERSON IS NOT ABLE TO BE CIRCUMVENT IT I WAS PART OF WHAT THE- I. G. FILE. SINGLE AT LEAST CHANGE THAT PROCESS UP AND THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WHEN WE GO OUT THERE IS A LOOK AT THEIR SCREENING PROCESS. MANY FOLKS HAVE DEVELOPED AT AND I'LL CALL IT A CHOKEPOINT AT THE PRISON WHERE THEY'RE DYING EVERY BE ABLE TO ONE LOCATION. SO THAT- EVERYONE AND THEY CAN ENSURE THAT EVERYONE IS SCREENED BUT THOSE WHO THE PHYSICAL DESIGNED AS OF. LATE FOR THAT. THEN THEY PUT OTHER MEASURES IN PLACE TO ENSURE THE STAFF OF THE INAPPROPRIATELY SCREEN. THANK YOU AND I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION VERY QUICKLY YOU KNOW WE HAVE ANOTHER COLLEAGUES THAT ARE WAITING TO ANSWER. OUR TO ASK QUESTIONS IS- CAN WE AND I WANT TO THANK- MR KING AND MR TOASTIES. INFORMATION AND THEIR- SEGMENT ON THE PANEL WELL BUT I HAD A QUESTION IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER DIRECTIVES OR ANY OTHER ALTERNATIVES OR SOCCER PLANNING FOR HIGH RISK MEDICAL RELEASE IN ADDITION TO THE ELDERLY- PEARL ISSUE THAT THE LEGISLATURE- LEAD ON IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE. OTHER THAN JUST SENDING THEM TO A DIFFERENT FACILITY THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED. I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY OTHER RELEASE STRATEGIES THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED OR REVIEWED AT THIS TIME. AS I SAID WE CONTINUE TO DO THE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAY RELEASE PROGRAM. FOR THAT ROLE IN ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS FULL SECOND RELEASE. AND I KNOW WHO I'LL SEE SEE SEE SEE OUR CCAC AS AND I'LL LET DOCTOR BIG SPEAK TO. WEAR CONTINUALLY EVALUATE OUR PROCESSES AND DEVELOP AND WESTRAC JEEZ WE CAN DO. TO TRY TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE WORKING TO PROTECT OUR MOST VULNERABLE. PATIENTS OF DOCTOR BACK. DR. THANK YOU I WILL SAY THAT IN ADDITION TO WHAT CONNIE SAID WITH THE RECENT CHANGE IN THE LAW THAT ALLOWS PATIENTS TO BE CONSIDERED FOR COMPASSIONATE RELEASE IF THEY HAVE A LIFE EXPECTANCY OF TWELVE MONTHS OR LESS INSTEAD OF SIX MONTHS OR LESS THATWE ACTIVELY REACHED OUT TO EVERY INSTITUTION TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS WHO MAY IN FACT BE ELIGIBLE FOR COMPASSIONATE RELEASE AND OR MEDICAL PAROLE AND THOSE ARE ALL BEING FORWARDED FOR CONSIDERATION OF REMAKES. THANK IT AND ACTUALLY SIR GONZALEZ AT YOU ALL I THOUGHT IN YOUR REMARKS YOU ALSO WANT TO HAVE MISTER KING AND- DOCTOR PATEL'S THE ALSO. ADDRESS THAT QUESTION OR NOT. NOT NECESSARILY UNLESS THEY HAVE ANYTHING THAT WOULD BE- THAT COULD BE ADDED TO THAT BUT I THINK THAT- WAS A GREAT ANSWER SO THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN THANK YOU CHARACTER. ARC THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH- SO NEXT UP WE HAVE CENTER SKINNER AND THEY'LL BE FOLLOWED AGAIN BY CABRILLO BRADFORD JACKSON AND MORE LOCK SO- CENTER SKINNER. THANKS SO MUCH I'M- SO IT JUST HIT THE CDCR STAFF MS GIBSON AND DR BECK I'M PLEASED TO HEAR THAT CDCR IS LOOKING AT RESTORING ACCESS TO- FAMILY AND OTHER VISITATION THOUGH REMOTE BY VIRTUALLY AS WE ARE DOING HERE FOR MANY OF US- AND LOOKING RE RE LOOKING AGAIN OF PROGRAMMING SO THOSE GOOD HOWEVER IT SEEMS TO ME RIGHT NOW THAT THE MOST ESSENTIAL THING IS TO GET THE VIRUS UNDER CONTROL AND I WOULD POINTS TO THOSE WHO. MAY BE- OBSERVING THIS HEARING OR PARTICIPATING IN THIS HEARING THAT CDC OURS OWN WEBSITE HAS A TRACKER ON- THAT SHOWS COULD BE CASES AND COMPARES THOSE CODE CASES TO THE NUMBER PER CAPITA WITHIN OUR FACILITIES THE NUMBER PER AND THEN THE NUMBER OF CASES IN CALIFORNIA PER CAPITA IN THE NUMBER OF CASES IN THE COUNTRY- AND AS MR KING POINTED OUT SINCE OUR HEARING IN JULY WHICH WAS PROMPTED BY THE DISASTROUS TRANSFERRED CHIU SANDPOINT WHICH I'M LEAST A VERY SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CASES IN STATE COURT. AND UP TO THAT POINT YES WE HAD CASES IN A FEW FACILITIES BUT AND IF THE ANTI VIRUS WAS DEFINITELY SPREADING BUT. IT BECAME ALMOST- FIVE YOU KNOW THE DISTRICT MASS. AT THE POINT NOW CERTAIN SOME OF MEASURE WERE TAKEN I DO NOT MINIMIZE THE ACT HOWEVER WE ARE NOW IN A SITUATION WHERE IN THOSE FOUR MONTHS AS WAS POINTED OUT. WHERE WE HAD THAT HEARING THERE HAVE BEEN OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND. NEW CASES. AND IF WE LOOK JUST TODAY CLOSE TO SIXTEEN HUNDRED NEW CASES SO THAT WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO CASES. PER ONE THOUSAND INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS NOW LET'S COMPARE THAT WE KNOW THERE'S A SURGEON A REST OF THE STATE. HOWEVER FOR THE STATE IT'S TWENTY SIX CASES PER ONE THOUSAND AND THE REST OF THE US WHICH IS WORST IN CALIFORNIA IT'S THIRTY FOUR. ONE EIGHTY TWO TO A THOUSAND VERSUS THIRTY FOUR TO A THOUSAND. THAT IS. IN A- I FEEL AND I'M- NUMBER. SO WE NEED MUCH BETTER CONTROL AND WHILE I APPRECIATE THAT ARE WE HEARD FROM THAT THERE'S- ATTENTION TO THE MASKING FORSMAN. WE WERE TOLD IN JULY. THAT THE MASK PROTOCOL IS BEING ENFORCED AND YET HERE TODAY WE HEAR THAT EVEN IN HELLO CAN BAY THERE WHAT YOU MENTION OVER TEN INCIDENTS THAT OF LACK OF MAC MAC NOT THAT THEY WERE ENFORCED THE WORK BUT WHERE IT STAFF WERE NOT COMPLYING. SO IF WE NEED THAT MUCH TIME WE ARE STILL HAVING THAT LEVEL OF INCIDENTS OF NON COMPLIANCE ACT WHEN WE KNOW THAT IT'S THE EXTRA IT'S THE STAFF THAT ARE BRINGING THE VIRUS IN AND I DON'T SEE THAT TO BE CRUEL TO STAFF. IS JUST THE REALITY THAT IF YOU'RE- IN IF YOU ARE IN THE CONGREGATE FACILITY AND NOT GOING IN AND OUT YOU ARE NOT BRINGING. THE VIRUS IN IT IS ONLY DOES PEOPLE GOING IN AND OUT SO I'M NOT TRYING TO. MAKE I'M NOT TRYING TO CREATE A BALL SIGNED STAFF RATHER JUST THE FACT. SO I WANT TO HEAR FROM BOTH MS GIBSON AND DR BECK. I'D LIKE TO HAVE IT I AM NOT HAPPY ABOUT THESE NUMBERS AND I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THE ENFORCEMENT AND THEN I HAVE THREE OTHER QUESTIONS. SO WIRD DR PICKED ONE TAKE AT FIRST AND THEN THE THIS GIPSON. I SHARE YOUR FRUSTRATION SENATOR AND THIS IS KIND OF PARTICULARLY FRUSTRATING YEAR FOR ALL OF US IN PUBLIC HEALTH I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN BASIC SCIENCE PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES POLITICIZED IN A WAY THAT HAPPENED THIS YEAR. AND WHEN WE HAVE SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY PERCENTAGE OF OUR POPULATION TAKING THEIR LEAD FROM ELECTED FOLKS TO SAY THAT BASICALLY THE VIRUSES A HOAX AND- MASKS MAKE YOU SICK. ANDERSON INFRINGEMENT ON YOUR PERSONAL LIBERTIES IT'S ONLY MADE OUR JOB ALL THE MORE DIFFICULT THAT BEING SAID. IT'S AN EXPECTATION OF ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES THAT THEY WILL WEAR THEM. SECRETARY ALISON AND- RECEIVER MR KELSO ME THAT EXQUISITELY CLEAR AND AS CONNIE GIBSON DIRECTOR GIBSON JUST POINTED OUT. WE ARE GETTING EVEN MORE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN ENSURING THAT EMPLOYEES WHO CHOOSE TO NOT FOLLOW THAT DIRECTIVE WILL EXPERIENCE PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE. THE OTHER FACTOR THAT WE FOUND THROUGH OUR TOURISM FACILITIES AS WHAT WASBEING USED AS FACE COVERINGS VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY ALL OVER THE STATE. AND WE SAW THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE IN A PROBLEM. PEOPLE WEARING BANDANNAS AND GATORS AND MASKS WITH VALVES AND ALL TYPES OF THINGS THAT ARE NOT REALLY GOING TO ACHIEVE OUR GOAL AND SO RECENTLY THE DECISION WAS MADE AND IS BEING IMPLEMENTED THAT ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES WILL BE REQUIRED TO WEAR. THIS TYPE OF. COVERAGE IT'S MORE. IT'S STANDARD WILL BE MUCH EASIER AUDIT OUR STAFF AS WE ARE IN. FROM SURE THAT EVERYBODY WEARING THEM THEY'LL BE PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE TO EMPLOYEES. AND I THINK BY DOING SO WE'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE. A BETTER COMPLIANCE THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY IS. BEING DISTRIBUTED BUT IT WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO EVERY EMPLOYEE TO PER SHIFT AS THIS ROLLS OUT. AND THE LAST THING I WOULD WORRY AS IT ROLLS OUT WHEN. I BELIEVE THE NINE MEMBERS BEING SIGNED THIS WEEK- THERE WAS A LOT THAT WENT INTO MAKING SURE WE HAVE ADEQUATE SUPPLY THAT WE CAN HAVE HIM AVAILABLE AT EVERY INSTITUTION. BEING SIGNED THIS IT COULD STILL BE TWO WEEKS BEFORE STAFF RECEIVE THE MASKS. I DON'T BELIEVE SO I'LL DEFER TO CONNIE FOR THE SPECIFICS ON THE ROLL OUT. YOU KNOW ONCE THE MEMO IS SIGN THAT WOULD BE THE EXPECTATION THAT WE IMPLEMENT A MEET ELAINE SO WE'VE ALREADY BEEN SHIPPING A SURGICAL MASKS OF SUPPLIES TO THE PRISONS BECAUSE WE WERE PREPARING FOR THAT SO. THEY WILL BE READY TO GO ONCE THE MEMORANDUM IS THE SOFTEST SIGNED AND DISTRIBUTED. RIGHT YOU CAN- POLITICIAN CONTINUE. OWNER NO PROBLEM SENATOR AND I THINK THE ONLY LAST THING I WOULD SAY IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE SPACE COVERINGS ARE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE. PERFECT IT'S ONLY ONE OF MANY THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO. AND THERE IS THIS NTURAL TENSION BETWEEN TRYING TO MAKE AVAILABLE TO OUR ALL OF OUR PATIENTS ALL OF THE THINGS THAT. ARE VALUABLE IN THE SYSTEM AND IN TERMS OF VISITORS HERE DURING ARTS PROJECT PROJECTS IN EDUCATION AND- GARDEN PROJECTS IN THE DARK PROGRAM IN THEATER IN WRITING ALL THOSE OTHER VALUABLE THINGS. ALL OF WHICH ARE ACCOMPANIED BY RISKS WOMEN'S VOLUNTEERS ARE COMING INTO THE INSTITUTION. SO WE'RE TRYING TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE BETWEEN KEEPING OUR PATIENTS SAFE AND KEEPING THEM SO RESTRICTED. THAT THEIR QUALITY. OF LIFE IS EVEN FURTHER MINIMIZE. THANK YOU I- BY. I DON'T WANT TO SAY WELL. I'M GLAD THAT THERE WILL BE MASKS DISTRIBUTED I. IT'S NEVER TOO LATE BUT IT IS RATHER LATE AND ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE NUMBER OF CASES WE HAVE RIGHT NOW PER THOUSAND SO I JUST. IT'S DISAPPOINTING I WISH IT HAD HAPPENED EARLIER- THE NEXT QUESTION I HAVE IS THAT THIS IS BACK TO THIS ISSUE OF REVIEW OF THE MATTER MEDICALLY VULNERABLE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. CITIES HERE SELF IDENTIFIED SOME FORTY FOUR THOUSAND AND I AM MAY HAVE THAT NUMBER OF BUT IT WAS AND IT WAS IN A LARGE THOUSANDS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DETERMINED TO BE MEDICALLY VULNERABLE AND A LARGE SUBSET OF DOWN WERE ALSO DETERMINED TO BE. POTENTIALLY LOW RISK FOR VIOLENCE USING A RISK ASSESSMENT TOOL THAT CDC OUR HOUSE BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT ONCE THE REVIEW WAS COMPLETED ONLY FORTY FOUR WE'RE GIVING CONSIDERATION FOR RELEASE NOW WHY AT THE POINT WHERE WE HAVE THIS LEVEL OF INFECTION RATE. WOULD WE STILL RETAIN. SUCH A SICK. NUMBER OF MEDICALLY VULNERABLE. INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS- THAT HAVE LOW RISK FOR VIOLENCE OR RECIDIVISM. AND WE HAVE MUCH MORE THAN JUST THE COMPASSIONATE AND MEDICALLY PAROLE THINGS AT OUR AT OUR DISPOSAL THERE IS ELEVEN SEVENTY D. THERE'S THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER THERE ARE A VARIETY OF OTHER TOOLS THAT CDC OUR HOUSE AT ITS DISPOSAL. SO WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS WHAT IS CDC ARE DOING TO RE LOOK AT THIS POPULATION OF MEDICALLY VULNERABLE LOW RISK LOW RISK FOR RECIDIVISM IN VIOLENCE INDIVIDUALS. DID YOU WANT TO DIRECT A QUESTION TO. EITHEREITHER CCAR'S OFFICIAL IN THAT FEELS COMPLETELY ARTISTIC ON THE DOCTOR DID YOU WANNA TAKE THAT ON FIRST. IT'S REALLY MORE A QUESTION I THINK FOR OUR CDC ARE COLLEAGUES IN TERMS OF WHO IS EVENTUALLY RELEASED WE ARE EVALUATING PATIENTS WHO WE BELIEVE MEET THOSE CRITERIA IDENTIFYING THEM FROM A MEDICAL STANDPOINT. OKAY PERHAPS MISS GIBSON DIRECTOR GIBSON. SO I KNOW WE HAD- EARLIER LATE FALL EARLY FALL WE HAD ABOUT SIXTY HUNDRED SIXTY TWO HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE BEING SCREENED BY OUR- BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS AS RELATE TO. A MEDICALLY VULNERABLE POPULATION AND I'M NOT SURE OF THE NUMBERS THAT WERE RELEASED I WOULD HAVE TO GET THAT INFORMATION OFF OF THOSE REVIEWS. BUT THE BOARD GET A REVIEW OF THOSE CASES AND THEN PRESIDENT TO THE SECRETARY. AND I KNOW- I DON'T KNOW WHAT PERCENTAGE WHAT WAS THE- FINAL NUMBER OF WHO WAS RELEASED. AND HOW MANY OF THOSE FOR LOW RISK OFFENDERS- VERSUS MODERATE OR HIGH I WOULD HAVE TO GET SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO REALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION SENATOR I'M SORRY. OKAY PERHAPS WE I CAN SEND TO YOU IN WRITING RIGHT POLITIES TO BE A TWO LAST REMAINING QUESTIONS- WE HAVE THIS RECENT- JUDICIAL RULING TO THAT ORDERED RELEASES FROM SAN QUENTIN WE KNOW THAT IT'S BEING CHALLENGED BUT- THE- BOTH THE JUDGE AND THE PLAINTIFFS AND ATTORNEYS HAVE ARGUED THAT THE ONLY WAY TO MANAGE THIS SPREAD AT SAN QUENTIN IS FOR RELEASE I WANT AND SINCE WE ARE NOW CHALLENGING THAT MEANING THE STATE IS I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM CDC ARE AS TO WHAT YOUR SENSES IS WHAT IS THE STATE WAY. TO TRANSFER INMATES UP FROM SAN QUITE YET WE IS THERE- GIVEN. THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS THERE. WHAT IS THE- ASSURED SAFE WAY TO DO ANY TRANSFERS. THANK YOU SENATOR SO AS DOCTOR BIG SPOKE EARLIER AS IT RELATES TO ARCH TRANSFER OF PROCESSES WE PUT IN PLACE ENSURING THAT OFFENDERS ARE TRANSFERRED ARE TESTED REQUIRED TíNH. AT TESTED BEFORE THEY'RE RELEASED OFF A QUARANTINE TRANSFERRED. WITHIN NINETY FIVE ON THE TRANSPORTATION VEHICLES IN MASON STOP AS WELL AS WHEN THEY ARRIVE AT THE NEW INSTITUTION THEIR OFFER COBRA TESTING AGAIN WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS. ORANGE LINE AND BONDED TO. RIGHT I MEAN IT DOESN'T UP I'M SORRY YOU INDICATED OXFORD TESTING SO IS THAT THAT WE CANNOT REQUIRE IT. I DON'T BELIEVE WE ARE FORCING ME TO CALL THAT ASK SO I'LL DEFER TO DOCTOR BACK. IS THAT CORRECT DR BECK OKAY. CORRECT WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY FORCIBLY TESTING BUT FOR THOSE PATIENTS WHO DON'T KNOW. THEIR CORNERS WE NEED. IS THAT BECAUSE WE LEAGUE. SAY AGAIN YES SIR WE LEGALLY ARE PROHIBITED. THREE THREE WE WOULD HAVE TO GET A COURT ORDER TO FORCE TEST THEM BUT IT'S NOT REQUIRED SO WE HAVE WE WILL EITHER TEST THEM AND IF THEY DON'T THEN THEIR QUARANTINE IS PROLONGED BUT WE DO NOT REDUCE THEM OUT IF THEY'RE UNSAFE I WOULD SAY. THAT THE PATIENTS AT SAN QUENTIN ARE PROBABLY AT THIS TIME AMONG THE SAFEST TO TRANSFER BECAUSE MANY OF THEM HAVE HAD COVETED AND THERE AT LEAST FOR NOW NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO BEING RE INFECTED. IT SEEMS THAT THEY'VE NOT HAD CODED THAT WITHOUT THE TESTING. IT'S HARD TO. IT WOULD BE HARD TO ASSURE A SAFE. TRANSFER BUT I SUPPOSE WITH THE QUARANTINE BUT WE'D HAVE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE QUARANTINE. IN AN AREA WHERE IT'S REALLY SEGREGATED OR ANY FORCE MY UNDERSTANDING IS PART OF THE PROBLEM IT STANDPOINT WAS. WE DIDN'T HAVE AS MUCH ACCESS TO AREAS IN STANDPOINT WHERE WE COULD ACHIEVE THAT. YOU'RE RIGHT SENATOR AND THAT'S PART OF THE PROCESS THAT WE WENT HROUGH WITH OUR- OUTSIDE STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT EVERY SINGLE PRISON HAS CELL BASED. HOUSING FOR RECEPTION QUARANTINE AND THE FEW THAT THEIR PHYSICAL PLANT DOESN'T ALLOW THAT WE'VE MADE OTHER ARRANGEMENTS. BUT THAT QUARANTINE AND TESTING ON THE RECEIVING END IS CRITICAL. MY LAST QUESTION THIS IS AROUND JUVENILE SO HOPEFULLY- HOPEFULLY COMMUNITIES GIPSON ARE YOU DOCTOR BIG YOU'LL HAVE THE ANSWER TO THIS BUT I WONDERED IF THIS CDC ARE- TRACKER DOES NOT SHOW THE NUMBER OF CASES WITHIN OUR DOJ AND SO I WONDERED WHAT IS- WHAT ARE WE DOING IN TERMS OF TRACKING THE YOUTH THEY'RE BOTH ON TESTING AND CODE CASES. AND IF THE IF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS BEING- IF HE'S IF THEY'RE RECEIVING THESE REPORTS. SINCE IT'S NOT ON A PUBLIC WEBSITE. SO I DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S NOT ON THE PUBLIC WEBSITES I DO APOLOGIZE FOR THAT BUT I SHOWED AS OF THIS MORNING WHEN I. J. J. CURRENTLY HAS IS SHOWING NO CURRENT GOAL THAT CASE AS- BUT I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHY IT'S NOT ON THE PUBLIC FACING AND I WOULD THINK THAT INFORMATION IS SHARED WITH THE- EXAMPLES. HAVE THERE BEEN ANY JUVENILE DEATHS IN APOLOGIES I HAD NOT TRIED TO LOOK AT THAT I DIDN'T KNOW HAVE THERE BEEN ANY YET. RELATED TO KOBE. THE DOCUMENTS I HAVE TO GO AHEAD AFTER THE- NO I WASN'T SPEAKING BUT CENTER MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE ANSWER IS NO. YES I CHAU NINE RIGHT THANK YOU THANKS. THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER YOU CAN BE QUESTIONS ALRIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER SKINNER- NEXT UP IS SENATOR CAPPIELLO- WELCOME. COM THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR- FIRST LET ME THINK THAT PANEL THE ENTIRE PANEL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY IT'S- VERY-INFORMATIVE AND HELPFUL- I'VE HAD EIGHTY- NUMBER OF INMATE. COMPLAINTS IN REGARDS TO DOUBLE THEIR INABILITY TO GET TESTED IF THEY IF THEY WANT TO GET TESTED- THE LACK OF- AND THEN ONCE ILL LIMITED SERVICES IN TERMS OF CARE MEDICAL CARE AND- ATTENTION- AT FOR IN TERMS OF- AT IT. OF FEELING YOUNG AND NOT NOT BEING ABLE TO ACCESS SERVICES- AND THEN IN ADDITION THAT FAILURE TO FOLLOW THE PROTOCOL IN PARTICULAR MASK AND JUST SOCIAL DISTANCING- BY THE- THE CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS AND OTHER PEOPLE THAT- DIRECT THEM. IN THE PRESENT SO I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT OUT THERE BECAUSE- I I'VE HEARD ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND I'M HOPING THAT THEY'RE GETTING ADDRESSED AND RECOGNIZE THAT IN- I HAVE A NUMBER OF CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES IN MY DISTRICT AND IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND ALSO IN THE SALINAS VALLEY. AND IN MOST OF THOSE THE COUNTIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THE COUNTIES ARE REFUSING TO RECOGNIZE THE MASK ORDERS- AND THEY'RE DOING IT PUBLICLY- THROUGH THEIR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OR THEIR SHERIFF'S. AND ENCOURAGING BUSINESSES NOT TO CLOSE AND NOT TO WEAR MASKS SO WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS IN THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE FIND AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT- THAT- THAT INDIVIDUALS GET CONSEQUENCES AT WORK IF THEY'RE NOT GOING TO FOLLOW THE DIRECTIVES AND SO I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT I SEE THAT- BUT I YESTERDAY FOUND OUT THAT THERE IS A HUNGER STRIKE. IN THAT CORPORATE FACILITY AND THAT THE STRIKERS ARE ASKING FOR COULD BE PROTOCOL SUPPORT AND SO I WAS WONDERING IF MAYBE DIRECTOR GIPSON YOU COULD YOU COULD DOES IT SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT HUNGER STRIKE AND CONCERNED- BLASTING WE NEED OR- EVEN SICKER INMATES AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THEIR REQUESTS ARE ARE. FAIRLY REASONABLE- SO I WONDER IF YOU CAN YOU CAN ADDRESS. THAT DIRECTOR GIPSON. YEAH AT THE- YOU AS I'M NOT AWARE OF A HUNGER STRIKE A CHORD SO I NEED TO. UP ON THAT I KNOW WE WILL INTO. IN THE HUNGER STRIKES BUT IT'S NOT LIKE YOU STAND THIS IS MORE THAN. ONE IT MAY POTENTIALLY WHO'S PARTICIPATING ON THE HUNGER STRIKE FOR THE SAME REASON. SO I'M NOT AWARE OF THAT I NEED TO FOLLOW UP AND I CAN DEFINITELY GET BACK WITH YOU. THAT WOULD BE GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE- MISTER CHAIR OKAY THANK YOU CENTER COVERDALE. NEXT UP THE CENTER BRADFORD. WELCOME. HELLO I CAN'T HEAR MUSIC UP THERE WE GO GOOD. THANK YOU AS A SENATOR AND FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP HERE AND ALL MY CULTURE PARTICIPATED ALL MY QUESTIONS CALLER FALL ALONG THE LINES- THAT A PARDON REYES AS RELATES TO. P. P. ARE AMONG STAFF- I'VE BEEN CONTACTED AS WELL AS SHOCKED ASSEMBLY CHEER A PUBLIC SAFETY REGGIE JONES SAWYER EARLIER THIS SUMMER ABOUT. THE LACK OF ADEQUATE EQUIPMENT FOR EMPLOYEES THERE AND WE SEEM TO BELIEVE THAT THAT STILL EXISTS TODAY- BUT I'VE HEARD WHAT- DIRECTOR GIPSON STATED THAT OUR EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN. BEING PROVIDED BUT I ALSO HEARD THERE'S A CHANGE OF RACISM AND- IMPLICIT BIASES I GUESS AS IT RELATES TO THE ROLE OF THE JUST QUIT MAN WHO'S BEING- I GUESS- DISCIPLINE FOR EITHER WEARING OR NOT WEARING IT AND THINGS ALONG THOSE NAY- ALLIANCE. ALSO I'M CURIOUS ON WHAT IS THE POPULATION WHAT'S THAT NUMBER OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE FIFTY YEARS OR OLDER WHO HAVE DONE. SERVED AT LEAST TWENTY YEARS. WOULD BE OLDER FOR ELDERLY PEROT I THAT'S SINCE ON WHAT KIND OF POP. WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE AND UNDERSTANDING HOW TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHY WE CAN'T BE A LITTLE BIT MORE MORE RESPONSIVE AND NOT. GETTING SOME OF THESE FOLKS HOME AND I GETTING A MOTHER'S RISK FACTOR THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS RIGHT NOW. AND MY AND MY LOOK MY LAST QUESTION I WILL ROLL IT ALL IN ONE- ALSO WHAT IS SHE SHE ARE DOING AND WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND THE PHOTO. AGENCIES AND PREPARING FOR THE BACKS- VACCINE ROLLOUT. THAT DIRECTOR GIVES A BEGIN AND THEN WE HAVE TO TALK- THERE'S UP. YES A SENATOR FOR THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE FIFTY AND OVER WHO WILL QUALIFY FOR ELDERLY PAROLE I WILL NEED TO GET YOU THAT INFORMATION I DON'T HAVE THAT READILY AVAILABLE. I CAN DEFINITELY SUPPLY THAT TO YOU. AS IT RELATES TO THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE P. AND THEIR AVAILABILITY OF PP. IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS PANDEMIC GAS. EVERYWHERE PEOPLE WERE EXPERIENCING A SHORTAGE OF P. B. S. SO THAT WE S. C. C. R. C. C. H. U. S. BUT THERE ARE EMPLOYERS AND- ACTIVATING OR DEPARTMENTAL OPERATIONS CENTER WHICH HAS THE- OVERSIGHT TO ORDER OR INQUIRE PP BAR STAFF- LOOKING AT THE LEVELS OF THE PRISONS HAVE SO THAT THEY- REQUEST. UP WELL THAT'S NOT A BIG KNOWS DIFFERENTLY- THE SUPPLY OF PPD WITHIN OUR SYSTEM AS IT RELATES TO IN NINETY FIVE GLOVES MASKS. ANIL'S APPROPRIATE SUPPLIES FOR OUR STOP- SEEMS TO BE AN ISSUE RIGHT NOW WE SEEM TO BE ABLE TO GET WHAT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT OUR STAFF GET IN AND IS PART OF THE CONVERSATION WE HAVE WITH INSTITUTIONS. IN PARTICULAR WHAT WE DO OUR JOINT CALL CCAC SNCC ARE. PRESENT IN THEIR EXECUTIVE TEAMS WHO MAY BE EXPERIENCED AN OUTBREAK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE TALK TO THEM ABOUT IS. THERE PP SUPPLY AND DO THEY HAVE ENOUGH TO DO WE HAVE BOTH IN THE RIGHT TYPE OF PP AND WE PUT OUT THE P. GUIDANCE. BUT IF YOU'RE WORKING IN A QUARANTINE BUILD IN ISOLATION BUILDING YOU'RE IN IN NINETY FIVE. OF THE STAFF ARE WHO WERE BORN IN AND OUT OF THOSE BUILDINGS. AND SO I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT'S TO BE. ISSUE ANY LONGER BECAUSE WE ARE. DEFINITELY HAVE PLENTY OF SUPPLY AND TO OUR DEPARTMENT OPERATIONS CENTER WE ARE VERY. RESPONSIVE TO THE PRISON AND THEIR NEEDS. AS IT RELATES TO THE VACCINE IN OUR PREPARATION WE ARE. IN JOIN. WITH THIS CD P. H. AND- I IDENTIFY- THE PRIORITY FOR OUR STAFF TO BE TESTED I KNOW DOCTOR BIG WILL SPEAK ABOUT THIS VACCINATIONS FOR THE INMATES WHAT WE ARE DOING- EVERY DEAL OVER CLASSIFICATIONS OF OUR STAFF TO ENGAGE WITH THE POPULATION THE MILES. SAID WE CAN COME UP WITH SOME NUMBERS AS TO WHETHER ITS OFFICERS SERGEANTS NURSES WHO MATTER I'M THE NUMBER OF FOLKS THAT WE WOULD NEED AND THEN PRIORITIZE OF SPOKES. FOR THE RECEPTIONS ARE TO BE OFFERED THE VACCINATION WHEN IT'S READY- THANK YOU BIG DO YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT THE INMATES OR ANYTHING. YOU'RE THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD IS THAT EARLY ON IN FEBRUARY MARCH WHEN ACQUISITION OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT WAS SKETCHY FOR EVERYBODY. BERMAN ARE READ. TO SOME OF THE I. A. K. TO BIRD. FACE COVERINGS FOR BOTH OUR EMPLOYEES AND FOR OUR INMATES. AND DELIVERED THEM TO EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. SO EVERYONE WAS PROVIDED FACE COVERINGS VERY EARLY ON. AND THEY ALSO MANUFACTURED. ARE ALCOHOL BASED HAND RUB SO THAT PEOPLE COULD DO DISINFECTION BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN ALL OF THE STORE SHELVES WERE EMPTY. AS FAR AS THE VACCINE PREPAREDNESS WE'VE BEEN MEETING WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH SINCE JULY. THEIR WEEKLY MEETINGS ARE ONGOING NOW WE'RE PREPARING EXTENSIVELY WITH THEM AND- IN FACT THIS WEEK CARE SUBMITTING PAPERWORK THAT WILL ENSURE THAT WERE IN THE QUEUE. FOR WHATEVER OUR SUPPLIES PROVIDED TO CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU A SEPARATE FOR DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS- ON THE ISSUE OF RACE THAT I'D HEARD FROM SOME OF THE EMPLOYEES IT IS. IS THERE ANY TENSION THERE AS TO WHO GETS IT- WHO'S BEING DISCIPLINED EVEN AS IT RELATES TO THE AND MAKES THEM SO THOSE ARE REYES SPLIT FACTOR AND ANY OF THOSE ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT BUT- IT HAS BEEN. BROUGHT TO BOTH MYSELF AND SOME WOMEN ON JONES SAWYER SAID TENSION THAT THEY FILL THEIR SOME. BIASES ARE. I HAVE NOT HEARD THAT SENATOR AND- WILL DEFINITELY IF YOU COULD SHARE- IF THERE'S PARTICULAR INSTITUTIONS WHERE YOUR HAND THAT THAT'S OUR PROBLEM- PPVS ARE AVAILABLE AND- SUPPLIES ARE AVAILABLE BASED ON- THE STAFF NEEDS OTHER APPROPRIATE PP AT THEIR WORK IN A PARKING SPACE. AND ISOLATION SPACE IT SURE THAT THE POPULATION HAVE WHAT THEY HAVE. SO IT- I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO LOOK INTO THAT CONCERN BECAUSE NO I'M NOT AWARE OF AND HAVE NOT HEARD THAT. OKAY THANK YOU. WE JUST HAD ALTHOUGH. DEAR WHERE OF IT. AND THAT HER STAFF FOR BEING SENSITIVE THOSE ISSUES.

THANK YOU ANY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS CENTER BRADFORD I'M FINE THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER BRADFORD- NEXT UP IS SENATOR JACKSON. WELCOME. OKAY MY AND MUTED NOW GREAT ALL RIGHT- I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION AYE AYE AYE SURE SOME OF THE FRUSTRATION- THAT JOB IT'S TAKEN SO LONG TO KIND OF GET OUR ACT TOGETHER HERE- THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE- RECALCITRANT STAFF THEY DON'T WANT TO WEAR THEIR MASKS I DON'T WANT TO BE TESTED. YOU KNOW I'VE GOT A- THE COUSIN WHO WORKS IN A SENIOR FACILITY I AND IF HE DOESN'T GET TESTED REGULARLY HE DOESN'T GET TO GO TO WORK. HE DOESN'T GET PAID. I'M I'M KIND OF CURIOUS AS TO WHY THAT KIND OF- YOU KNOW. STRONGER PERSPECTIVE STRONGER IMPLEMENTATION OF BARI IS THE YOUNG PERSON'S HASN'T HASN'T BEEN EFFECTUATED I MEAN THE NOTION THAT A GUARD TO US I DON'T WANT TO GET TESTED. ARE COMING IN TO WORK OR I DON'T WANT TO WEAR MY MASK AND THEY AND THEY CAN DO THAT. I GIVEN THAT WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF THE- VIRUS COMES IN THROUGH STAFF AND IN PEOPLE FROM THE OUTSIDE I WONDER IF- WAS GIPSON YOU COULD SHARE WITH US WHY THERE HASN'T BEEN A- A STRONGER- INCENTIVE TO GET COMPLIANCE FROM LIVE FROM THE STAFF. SENATORS SO FOR AS IT RELATES TO A MASS WARY OF OUR STAFF COME IN AND THEY SAY THEY ARE REFUSING TO DON THEIR MASKS. AND THEY'RE DENIED ENTRY. AND IF THEY ARE- ALLEGED TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF RESULT COMBINATION REQUEST THEY WILL WORK THROUGH A SEPARATE PROCESS THROUGH THAT PIECE BUT THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED ENTRY AND AS IT RELATES TO THE STAFF WHO ARE REFUSING TO TASK I KNOW ARE HARD THIRTIES ARE DEALING WITH THAT THE DEPRESSED DISCIPLINARY PROCESS AND I AGREE WITH YOU I AM VERY CONCERNED WILL STOP USED TO TEST WHEN WE KNOW THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THE ENVIRONMENT SAFER ALL AND WE CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THAT BEHAVIOR AND HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE. WELL. THE LEGISLATURE TO ASSIST YOU IN MAKING SURE THAT IF THEY ARE IN FACT LEGITIMATE STEPS- THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN- CERTAINLY PROCESS YOU KNOW GOING FORWARD IF WE DIDN'T DO THEM EARLIER ON BUT WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF ANOTHER A HUGE SPIKE AND PERHAPS IF WE CAN SAVE SOME LIVES WELL THAT'S A GOOD THING SO IS MISTER KING SO ON THIS THING. YEAH SAY THAT THIS. STEP REALLY THOSE MOST RIVER. WE'VE HEARD FROM FROM DOZENS IF NOT WHO OF PEOPLE WITH SALAS INTO PLAN AND ALL. FAMILIES BY SUPPORT EVERY IN BACK SUS- A ANY PLANNED DOESN'T ADDRESS DRUM WE DO THE- BY. CAPACITY FOR ONE HUNDRED AND PERCENT WORKER IS. 52% HEALTH OFFICIALS ARE CALL FOR- IS GOING TO BE PROBLEM- EXANE. WE KNOW THEY'VE BEEN ISSUED HAND SANITIZER ONE TIME SINCE THE- SINCE THE PROGRAM WENT ON MODIFY PROGRAM. MODIFIED PROGRAM BACK IN MARCH- PEOPLE ARE ASKING WHEN THEY WILL BE ISSUED ON HAND SANITIZER AND IN FACT A LOCAL CELEBRITY DONATED A THOUSAND GALLONS TO SAN QUENTIN. WHICH TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE IS STILL SITTING IN A WAREHOUSE WAITING ON DISTRIBUTION- WE- ALSO- A LOT OF PEOPLE OTHER DAY AT THE MAJORITY OF PRISONS ARE THERE BEING ALLOWED OUT OF THEIR SAILS. AND GIVEN THE CHOICE TO EITHER GO MAKE A PHONE CALL GO TO THE ER OR GO GET A SHOWER- YOUR TIME SHOULD BE MUCH MORE AVAILABLE BECAUSE YOU CAN DISTANCE MORE IN THE FRESH AIR AND THE VIRUS DOES NOT SPREAD AS WELL- AND EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT BEING ALLOWED A LOT OF ACCESS TO FRESH AIR. THEY ARE STILL BEING CALLED A POINT TO GO WORKING IN CLOSE PROXIMITY WITH- FREE STAFF WERE COMING INTO WORK IN LIKE THE KITCHEN AND OTHER ESSENTIAL AREAS. SO A REDUCTION IN THAT TYPE OF- COERCION COUPLED WITH MORE- ABILITY TO GO OUT IN THE OPEN AIR AND IN FREE SPACE. ALL LAYERED ON TOP OF DRAMATICALLY REDUCING THE POPULATION WHAT PEOPLE ARE ASKING. OKAY AND- THE DIRECTOR GIPSON DO YOU WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT AND DISCUSS- WHAT ARE SOME THE THINGS THAT THE MISTER KING BROUGHT UP THE- TEACHERS EITHER PURSUING OR LOOKING FOR SOMETHING- YES I CAN DO THAT. I'M AS IT RELATES TO THE RELEASE OF THE MEDICALLY BARBARA I THINK DR BIGGS TALKED ABOUT CCA'S YES AND UPPERS. AND HAVE BEEN THERE PROVIDE I DON'T THOSE. WHO MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR. MEDICAL L. PEROT. AND LOOK AND IS LOOKING AT THOSE CASES CLOSELY. SO I THINK THERE IS SOME MOVEMENT THERE A CCAC S. CONTINUES TO LOOK AT THOSE TYPE OF CASES THEY MAY QUALIFY FOR MEDICALLY. I MEAN ELDERLY PAROLE. AS WELL AS OR MEDICALLY PAROLE. I'M SORRY. WHAT THE- YES. ADDITION I AM SUPER TO HEAR AND I WOULD. DO CHECK SENT PLAN BECAUSE WE HAVE. THE OF HAND SANITIZER. DISINFECTING CLANS. BUT THE TO BE ABLE TO PLAYED SO THAT IS CONCERNED THE MEETING- YOU SAY THAT THE MA STILL DON'T HAVE I WILL TELL FOLLOW ON THAT BE. BECAUSE IS OUT THERE IN THE DAY WILL FLOORS FOR THE POPPY. AND WE HAVE PLENTY DR SAID OF THESE P. AT CALPE AYE DID IN THE FOR AS WHEN IT WAS SUCH SHORT OF HAS. WAS ACE TO MAY REPORT AND SO I WILL FOLLOW UP THAT ABOUT SIX. AND ASK FOR MORE YARD. I THINK IT GOES BACK TO WHAT ARCHITECT ABOUT- EARLIER ABOUT HOW DO WE- ENSURING THAT WE GET MORE. PROGRAM ACTIVE WHILE STILL MAKING SURE THAT THE ENVIRONMENT IS SAY AND SO WERE ASKED TO TRY TO MITIGATE THE SPREAD OF COBIT ONE THE THINGS WE INTO PLAY WAS THAT EACH HOUSING UNIT HAD A PROGRAM WITH THE SOUTH. IN ORDER TO TRY. TO WE DO. THE CROSS. OPPORTUNE IMPACT. ONE HOUSING UNIT TO THE- AS SO AND THEN. TO OUT HOW DO YOU. WORK TO ENSURE AS MANY OF THE POP AS MUCH OF THE POP. HAS THE UPPER. FOR YOUR ACTIVELY. AND I KNOW AS A TWO. PRO THROUGH THEY'D OF THE RE OPENING PLAN TO GET THE- BASE TO. THEIR ABLE PLACE THREE THEY'RE ABLE TO MAKE YOU KNOW BRING OUT MORE THAN ONE HOUSING UNIT AT A TIME TWO YARD. BUT IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WE'RE VERY MINDFUL FOR BIG MINDFUL. OF TRYING TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE GET SOME FRESH AIR GETS OUT OF JAIL TIME. IT'S JUST HOW DO WE- YOU KNOW WE DON'T WE ARE NOWHERE NEAR WHERE WE ARE PRETTY COLD WILL YOU MAY HAVE TO REBUILD. ON OF THIS ALL GO TO YORK. YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO CREATE SPACE ON THE YARD HAVE THE PHYSICAL DISTANCE THEME. AND PRESS MITIGATE THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS SO WE REALLY REDUCE THE NUMBERS OUT ON THE YARD. TRY TO BE STATE AND IS HOW DO WE THAT. TO A THAT PAGE AND INMATES HAVE THE ABILITY TO. GET SOME GUARD TIME. BUT ALSO DO IT IN A SAFE MANNER. SO YOU MENTIONED. THANK YOU YOU MENTIONED. DOING DIDN'T SAY. SO THAT NOT A- OUT THERE AT THE SAME TIME. WHAT ABOUT THE NEW. OF OR- CREATE MANY PRISON TO KEEP TO CAN. THE WHY- CREATING OUR- SUB. OF SMALL FIRMS. IS THAT SOME. THAT YOU HAVE CAN SEE. AN UNDERTAKER- AND IF NOT WHY NOT. SO I'M NOT QUITE WHAT THEY MEAN WHEN ARE I HEARD OCTOBER TELL THE SPEECH TO- CREIGHTON PRISON WITHIN THE- AND SO- FOR MANY OF OUR PRISON. EACH THIS. GRAHAM SEPARATELY SO THAT WOULD BE LIKE IF YOU HAVE BY WITHIN A PRISON IS LIKE FIVE MINUTES SINCE AND THEY WILL WE DID IS WE BROKE IT DOWN FURTHER SAY ON THIS FACILITY ONLY BILL AT A TIME CAN GO TO YOUR- SO THAT WE TRY TO BE. THE PROSCAR. FROM BUILD TO BUILD. SO THAT'S WHY WE DONE IS SO I DON'T KNOW THAT REALLY IS WHAT DOCTOR TELLS WAS REFERENCE WHEN HE SAID- COOL. CREATING MANY. BUT MANY OF OUR- ARE LIKE MANY. WITH A PRESENT AND THE WE IT OUT BY ALONE ONE HOUSE UNIT AT A TIME GO TO YOUR- SO MAYBE WE- TALK PATEL SIX AND WORLD SAME ROUTE ESSENTIAL TO GET INSIDE LIKE IT MIGHT BE FOR THE FOR. TIME RESPOND THAT IS WOULD YOU IN MIND DOCTOR. WHAT WHAT WE USE. THE PROPOSAL- THE MEASURES THAT THAT DIRECT GIPSON DESCRIBING ARE EXACTLY PART OF I MEAN. PRISONS WITHIN. THE DIFFICULTY IS WHEN THE CROSSLINK BE THOSE YOU REMAIN. SO IF YOU LOOK FOR IN AT THE RECENT. A LARGE OPEN AT S. A. T. F. THE SUBS OF TO TREAT THIS. MY UNDER THAT THE WAS COULD. TO BY THE FACT. THE KIDS STAFF. AND THE LITTLE WERE WORKING A THE BUTTER WHEN YOU. FOR WERE MIXING WITH LARGE NUMBERS OF OTHER. AND THAT WHAT HAVE THERE FOR WAS THAT. THE NAY CHAU OUT BREAK THAT HAVE. THE BETTER MANUFACTURING VESSEL AND- WAS UNABLE TO SEE VERY RAPIDLY TO ALMOST HUNDRED. IF THE PRESENCE ARE ON IT'S A WAY THAT THE ISN'T STAFF ACROSS OVER THE DOESN'T SHIFT IN HOUSING UNIT THE AFTERNOON IN ANOTHER. AND IT DOESN'T HAVE RESIDENTS ARE WORK IN ONE A AND THEN SLEEPING IN ANOTHER A- AND- THIS RAP. TRANSMISSION FROM ONE HOUSE UNIT TO A- THAT'S WHAT I MEAN BY MORE EFFECTIVE. TO WEAR THOSE MANY PRISONS THAT THE DIRECTOR GIPSON DESCRIBED ARE FURTHER ISOLATED FROM EACH OTHER BY PREVENTING BOTH STAFF AND RESIDENTS FROM CROSSING OVER BETWEEN THEM. AND THAT THOSE STAFF WHO HAVE TO CROSS OVER BETWEEN THEM OF THOSE RESIDENTS WHO AFTER CROSSOVER THEY HAVE ENHANCED TESTING THEY HAVE ENHANCED PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT- SO THAT WHEN. AN INFECTION HAPPENS IT CAN BE DETECTED EVEN MORE QUICKLY BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL. TO INFECT MULTIPLE HOUSING UNITS AT THE SAME TIME. SO IS THERE SOMETHING TAKE A ABSENT THAT- SKIP THAT- AND HE CONSIDER OR THE YOU'RE WILLING CAN. I MEAN IF WE'RE IF WE'RE TRYING TO. KIND OF. MAKE THIS WORK. I WOULD USE TO THAT. YES WHAT DOCTOR TOLD THE SAYS SENSE AND SO FARAS- TRYING TO KEEP THOSE WORK WHO MAY BE KITCHEN WERE ASIDE TO ONE. IN AND SO LOOKED LOOK AT THAT AND HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS- BECAUSE WE ARE TRYING TO. YOU KNOW REALLY HAVE OUR STAFF STAY IN ONE AREA WORK ONE AREA UNDERSTANDING SOMETIME WE BUMP UP AGAINST HAVING TO. HIGHER TIME BECAUSE UP CALL SO. BUT THE- TO SOME THAT RECKON I THEM. AS RELATES TO TRY TO MITIGATE THE SPREAD WE COULD LOOK THAT CENTER. RIGHT AND MY LAST- GO TO THIS. SEEM TAKING A LOOK AT. MEDICAL HIGH RISK OF PRISONERS EARLY REAL. OR COMPARE WERE- SO THEY- YOU CAN REDUCE SIZE THE PRISON. IN DO SO. LOW RISK- IT MAY STATUS JUST DOT. WELLBEING INCLUDED WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN REGARD IT SHOULD SHOW THAT YOU THE- ABILITY TO TALK WHERE YOU KNOW IT FOR THEIR OFFER. OR LET- IS SOMETHING YOU MIGHT MORE. OR DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU'RE MOVING AT THE PACE THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BE RESPONSIVE TO THOSE ISSUES WITH YOU KNOW GET TAKING PEOPLE GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF DONE THEIR TIME AND ARE AT LOW RISK OR WHO MIGHT BE- HAVE THE HIGH. RISKS FOR COALBED ARE OTHERWISE LOW RISK FOR RECIDIVISM. WHAT HAPPENING WITH THEIR PROGRAM BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO HAVE SOME PROMISE- AND SOMETHING THAT IT'S- LIKE THAT'S REALLY IN EXCLUSIVELY IN YOUR DAILY WORK- THAT YOU HAVE FULL. TO AND JUST TO MAKE THOSE TO. FOR I'M WONDERING HOW THAT BEING. OR FOR WRONG THE YOU DO HAVE THE AT THE- OR THAT- EXCLUDES OR THAT OTHERS TO SHARE THAT ALREADY I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL IN TRYING TO. ANTICIPATE HOW WE CAN. EXPEDITE RELEASE WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE. SO CENTER- I DON'T HAVE A ANSWER FOR QUESTION TO WHETHER OR NEXT I KNOW WE'RE DOING MAY-THINGS. TO ADDRESS THE- NEEDS ENSURE THAT. THOSE WHO ARE MOST MEDIC BOTTOM ARE WE THE NURSES. AND I WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK LOOK AT ISSUE AND ANSWER COVERS A ABOUT- I'M NOT AWARE OF THERE'S ANY OTHER STRATEGY HE'S BEEN BILLS RIGHT NOW FOR A- THE RELEASE OF MORE MEDICALLY. PAY AT THE SIDE WHAT ARE BIG RED AS WE TO THE WHO ARE YET- OVER AND IF THEY MEET THE- FOR. BERLIN TO THAT PROCESS- BUT I CAN DE TAKE THIS BACK I AM SO I DON'T AN ANSWER FOR YOU I JUST WHO GETS TO DO THESE THINGS I MEAN IT IT'S KINDA FEELS YOU YOU ARE. THE SOLD OF WHETHER CAN RELEASED ON AN EARLY RELEASE PROGRAM FOR THE REASON THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED- ACT THAT'S REALLY TO YOU EXCLUSIVELY TO YOU YOU KNOW UP TO THE PRISONS EXCLUSIVELY. WHILE THE SECRETARY DOES HAVE A- DO RELEASE AS- AND I'M SORRY I DON'T HAVE THE GOVERNMENT CODE THAT ALLOWS FOR THAT. SO I CAN'T SAY WHAT ALL SHE'S ALLOWED TO DO BUT I DON'T WANT TO. SPEAK ON HER BEHALF AS TO. AT THAT ISSUE I DO KNOW AS A SET OF SIXTY TWO HUNDRED. EARLIER FALL LATE SUMMER REVIEW BY P. P. H. AND I DON'T KNOW THE NUMBER OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE APPROVED FOR RELEASE. BUT I KNOW- THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS THAT REVEALED THEY WERE SUBMITTED TO THE SECRETARY. AND THE FORMER SECRETARY- MASON DECISIONS AS TO WHETHER TO RELEASE OR NOT AND I DON'T HAVE THOSE NUMBERS SENATOR. SHOW IN A BOTTOM LINE THERE'S NO MANDATE TO DO IT THERE'S TRUST- THROUGH A PROCESS THAT EXISTS OF THE SECRETARY SO DECIDES IS THAT ACCURATE. I THINK I MAY BE OVERSIMPLIFYING IT SENATORS SO. I WANT TO SAY I DO KNOW THE SECRETARY HAS. THE AUTHORITY UNDER GOVERNMENT CO. BUT I THINK IT'S MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT. THANK YOU AND I JUST LIKE TO SUGGEST TO MY COLLEAGUES SINCE. IN ABOUT TEN DAYS I WILL NO LONGER BE A SENATOR- THROUGH THE GREAT TERM LIMITS PROGRAM I'M SUGGEST THIS MIGHT BE SOMETHING WHERE WE SHOULD LOOK MORE. CAREFULLY BECAUSE. IT SOUNDS LIKE. THE DECISION MAKER IS SOME UP IN THE EITHER- AND THEN FOR. UNDER THE SIR. THIS IS AN OP. FOR LEGISLATURE. ODDS SAID PAUL IS TO WIN. ARE THESE PRISON ARE SHOULD- AT RISK. TO THE PRETTY. CRISIS THERE DOES AS THIS ONE OR WHEN HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE JUST GENERALLY TO TRY. REDUCE THE SIZE OF OUR PRISON IF THEY'RE ON NEXT- CROWDED- AFTER. WHO JUST- TO BE REALLY FOR. MEDICAL SO LOW RISK REASONS BUT IT SEEMS THERE'S A WAY TOO MUCH. A HERE. WITHIN THE PRISONS- TO MAKE THOSE. UNILATERALLY FRANKLY WITHOUT A WHOLE LOT OF ACCOUNTABILITY. SO THANK THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSES AND FOR THE TIME TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS THANK YOU. HE SAYS JACKSON- PERHAPS I WOULD NOTE THAT MR KING. IT DID PUT HIS HAND UP BUT WE NOT ACTUALLY TO. ANSWERS FROM IN YOU'RE BEING BY SEN THE YOU WANT TO CO HIM ACROSS. AND RELATIONAL YOU JUST. MIGHT MISS KING WE YOU RISK WOULD YOU. TO THAT LAST UP. IS THAT INEC STATE- AND- IF SO WHAT WOULD YOU. THE DO- TO BECOME IN IN THE PROCESS. IT IS AN ACCURATE A SEARCH- THE SIX DIRECT GIVE DIDN'T THE NUMBER I DO OF THE EIGHTY TWO HUNDRED WHO ARE HIRED LESTER ONE PER WERE ACTUALLY RELEASED- SO LESS THAN EIGHTY PEOPLE- WERE EVEN THOUGH THEY THE ISSUE WAS NOT WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE HIGHER OF DID THE ISSUE WAS THE TYPE OF SAN THEY HAVE WHETHER THEY WERE WHERE LIFE ARE NOT. OF THE VERY FIRST THING THAT THAT NEED TO HAPPEN THE MAJORITY OF SAN OF CD OURS ELDERLY POPULAR ARE PEOPLE WITH A SENTENCE HE WOULD DETERMINE IS INSISTENT BE YOUNGER- SO THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE ALL THE FALL INTO THIS INDETERMINATE SENTENCE CATEGORY AND ARE BEING EXCLUDED FROM HIGH RISK MEDICAL CONSIDERATION BECAUSE OF IT- AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S GREAT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO LOOK AT HOW DO WE CREATE MORE AVENUES FOR LIFERS TO GET OUT IN A LARGE SCALE WAY IN RESPONSE. TO THIS PANDEMIC. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SENATE JACKSON CENTER MORE. YOU. FOR I THANK YOU CHAIR I ALSO HAVE. THE CHIU OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE SENATOR NAY SKINNER AND CENTER SKINNER WAS A NON TO SERVE YOUR VICE IN. I WILL MISS YOU AND I ARE COLLEAGUE A LOT- MY QUESTION IS TO DOCTOR PROPOSED. I'M CURIOUS ABOUT METRICS- HOW DO WE COMPARE TO THE OTHER FORTY NINE PRISON SYSTEMS IN THIS COUNTRY. WE SHOULD KNOW HOW MANY PRISONERS WE HAVE HOW MANY CASES AND HOW MANY DEATHS AND I'M JUST WONDERING- HOW THAT DATA COMPARES TO THE OTHER FORTY NINE STATES EVERY AVERAGE- WE- WORSE ARE WE BETTER. THANK YOU REAL QUICK AND I WISH I WAS BETTER PREPARED TO ANSWER IT- LET ME SAY THAT THE LAST TO STATISTICS THAT I SAW SUGGESTED THAT. SEVEN OF THE TOP TEN PRISON AND JAIL OUTBREAKS IN THE COUNTRY WERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO THAT ISN'T AN ENCOURAGING SIGN- HOWEVER I DID READ. SEE SOME FROM TEXAS SUGGESTS THAT THEY'RE DOING WORSE- IN TERMS OF MORTALITY. AND ONE SHOCKING STATISTIC WHICH IS VERY MUCH ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT SENATOR JACKSON MISTER KING WE'RE JUST SPEAKING ABOUT. AND THAT IS THAT OF THE DEATHS IN TEXAS 58% OF THOSE WERE ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE AT THE TIME OF THEIR DEATH. AND AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK- IS A VERY SOBERING STATISTIC AND SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT- THOSE PEOPLE ARE AND DO NOT HAVE DEATH SENTENCES. AND YET THEY'RE DYING AS A RESULT OF THE CONDITIONS THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE HOUSED IN. MY NEXT QUESTION IS TO- DR BECK- OF BASED ON WHAT WE'RE LEARNING SO FAR THIS YEAR WHAT WHAT HAVE. WE'VE DEVELOPED AS BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES WHAT WE DETERMINED THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. AND NOW THAT WE HAVE MORE DATA. TO AVAIL OURSELVES FROM. SOONER TO SEE I THINK THE MOST STRIKING THING WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT IF YOU ARE IN ANY OPEN DORM SETTING. OR A HOW UNIT THAT'S FUNCTION AN OPEN DORM LIFE SAME PARTNER FALL SOMEWHERE YOU MAY HAVE YOUR INTERNET SO. BUT THE FRONT DOOR IS ACTUALLY EITHER BY OR FOR FREE. THAT IT'S INCREDIBLE CHALLENGING TO KEEP SOMEBODY SAFE AND THAT TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT. AND ESPECIALLY FOR OUR HIGHER RISK PEOPLE THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE ARE HIGHER CRUDE RESTORES- THERE'S A THERE'S AND URGING TO GET THEM MOVED INTO. THAT ARE LESS LIKELY TO EXPOSE THEM TO KOBE. AND THEN OF. BY LAST QUESTION IS TO. MR AS WERE- PRISONERS BE RELEASED BACK INTO THE PUBLIC SECTOR WORK WHAT DO WE DO TO ASSURE OUR CONSTITUENTS STATE THEY WANT TO FEEL SAFE SO WHAT DO WE- WHAT ARE WE ARE WE GOING TO GUARANTEE THAT FOR. CONSTITUENTS THANK YOU A I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION- THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED THROUGHOUT OUR STATE PRISON SYSTEM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN TEN FIFTEEN YEARS ON TWENTY YEARS THERE ARE NO MORE THE SAME PEOPLE THEY ARE TODAY THEN YOU AND I ARE THE SAME PEOPLE WE WORK DURING OUR TIME- PEOPLE ARE CONTACTING US ALMOST EVERY DAY WITH SOLID RELEASE PLANS FOR THEIR LOVED ONES AND FAMILIES- AS HAS BEEN THE CASE FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME- FAMILIES ARE THE NUMBER ONE WE INTRIGUED. PROVIDER AND THEY'RE STANDING BY READY TO TAKE THEIR LOVED ONES HOME AND HELP THEM ISOLATED AT HOME SO THAT THEY'RE NOT IN ANYMORE LARGER CONGREGATE SETTINGS THE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD SAY IS WE'VE SEEN THIS YEAR- CDCR REMINDS US OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT THEY'VE RELEASED ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE MORE OR LESS ON TIME. YET THE- THERE HAS BEEN NO UPTICK IN IN RECIDIVISM AS A RESULT SO WE SEE THAT WE CAN SAFELY DO MORE RELEASES AND THEY HAVE FOR PUBLIC. HEALTH SAKE WE SHOULD. I AM- JUST CHRISTMAS. BASED ON THE FIRST- THERE IS AN THERE HAS BE A NASH SOCIAL. OF PRISONS. I WOULD ASSUME. JUST LIKE THERE ARE THIS. FOR ALL OTHER FUNCTIONS. BUT IT BE. HELPFUL IF THEY HAD PROVIDE SOME OF. ANALYSIS OF WHAT IS THE HOW PRISON HAVE. HAVE BEEN TED POSITIVE HOW MANY. YOU KNOW HOW MANY OF THE AND WHAT BURKE IN AND WATER. SOME OF BETTER SYSTEMS DO- TO KEEP THE NUMBERS LOW AND WHAT ARE SOME OF THE- FAILING SYSTEMS DOING- THAT. THEY CAN IDENTIFY AREAS OF IMPROVEMNT SO WITH THAT MR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO ASK A FEW QUESTIONS THANK. THANK YOU SIR MORE LOCK- MAY MAYBE- JUST BRIEFLY ASK- DIRECTOR GIVES AND IS THERE SUCH AN ASSOCIATION THAT CDC ARE PERHAPS YEARS DATA WITH WITH OTHER STATES. THE SAID DRESS. MORLOCKS. OUR CENTERPLATE PICKS ANSWER THAT YEAH I SAY THAT THERE ARE NUMBER OF. AND WE ALONG TO THEM A NATIONAL COMMISSIONER CORRECTIONAL CARE MANY OF OUR POSITION ARE MEMBER THE AMERICAN OF CRACKS OFFICER WHICH RECENT. ARE A POSITION PAPER IN FRONT OF THE RED SO. URGING THEM TO OUR- PUT OUR PATIENTS CENTERS TO THE OF THE LIST FOR UNITS. AND TO YOUR CENTER THERE DATA PUT OUT BY TOMORROW PROJECT MOST RECENTLY OCTOBER. TWENTY WHICH IS BY STATE WHAT KRONE VIRUSES WHICH THAT K. LITTLE THAT MEAN IN TERMS OF K. AND- OUR- IN. OF DEATHS AND WE CAN YOU MAKE YOU WOULD LIKE. THANK THANK YOU CENTER MORE LAW AND NOW GET BACK CENTER. THANK YOU- SHARE PAN- AND I APPRECIATE ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE. I WANT TO GO BACK TO THIS ISSUE OF. THE HOW WE DEAL WITH VIRUS THE NUMBER OF CASES THAT ARE THIS CONGREGATE PARK FOR SO. AND AS WE ALREADY- HEARD THROUGHOUT THIS TESTIMONY THAT WE A NUMBER ARE RIGT. THERE'S BEEN SIGNIFICANT SINCE OUR JULY HEARING. AND- IT- WE HAVE A CASE THAT IS NOW BEFORE US IN WE KNOW THAT. AS GIVE POINTED OUT THE- THE CITY'S ART SELF WE HAVE A BOROUGH OF- TOOLS IT'S- DISPATCH CALLED SEP D. OR THE MEDICAL AND OR ELDER PAROLE OR COME RELEASE THAT WE A VARIETY OF TOOLS THAT COULD. US TO AT LEAST FOUR X. ENTRE SOMETHING FOR PROVIDES TYPE OF FOR THOSE WHO ARE MOST MEDICALLY. AND I RACED THEY MIGHT WAS THAT THE WERE AT SIX TWO HIGH. MEDICALLY IDENTIFY THAT WERE LOW RISK AND NON SEXIST MET OTHER. BUT THEN ONLY FOR FOUR. WERE RELEASED. YEAH AND I WILL TO AGAIN TO SEE ARE THAT THERE ARE TECHNIQUES IT CONCERNS PUBLIC. WE COULD FREE USE USE A MONITOR. WE COULD USE FOR LOW SYSTEM WE COULD A VERY OF SIX. THAT WE REMOVE A PARTY DEATH ST FOR DIESEL WHO ARE NOT SENTENCE TO DEATH BUT WHO IF THEY HIGHLY MEDICALLY ABLE AND CAN TO HAVE THE TYPE ABOUT THAT WE- THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE CAN. GET THE NEW STAY. YEAH PROTECT INTO WERE THE STATE TIME. THEY ARE PUBLIC'S. AND SO I WOULD A LITTLE MORE ON. A LIVE MORE RESEARCH AROUND THAT IN FOR HALF THEY ALSO WE AS IF SAFETY COMMITTEE AND WE HAVE THE P. AND- RESPONSE COMMITTEE THINK ABOUT WHETHER WE TO KEEP ME AT SOME POINT WHETHER WE WANT TO COMMUTE. SOMETHING TO DO. ON THIS QUEST AND I POINT THAT OUT NOT ONLY DO TO. HIGH NUMBER OF K. OF THE VIRUS BUT ALSO THAT WE- EVEN THE GOOD NUMBERS. THAT WE HAVE A LOWER AND MOST OF% THOSE WERE RELEASES ON THE NATURAL BUT AYWAY EVEN WITHOUT LOWER POPULATION WE ARE STILL ABOVE. THE DESIGN CAPACITY IF OF OUR- AND I'LL STOP THERE. DID YOUR DOCTOR DIRECTOR GIPSON YES THAT YEAH THE DRUG GIVES AND- AS I DE SHARE YOUR CONCERN ABOUT HIS THAT. OUR MEN BANGALORE PROTECT AND I DEFINITELY CONCERN ABOUT IS- AS ALL OF US ARE OVER HERE. ABOUT THE OF IN THE RATE OF IN WITHIN A SYSTEM. I'M AT THE END OF OUR WE WERE ABLE TO GET DOWN TO UNDER HUNDRED K. IN. AS AS A STATE. SO THE CITY ARE KNOW. GUITARIST IN A IN THE COMMUNITIES IN THE BRING IT BACK IN- I DON'T A RISK WOULD. TO THE RELEASE OF THE MEDIC BOTTLE. MY POPULATION BUT I DO SHOW BECAUSE OF HIS. THEIR SAFETY AND A- THAT. THEY NOT COMMITTED TO A DEATH SENTENCE WHEN IT CAME TO I DON'T SHARED AS- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SKINNER ARE. NO I THINK THE ARE MORE IT'S POINT THAT WE ENTER INTO SHE DISCUSS I'D AM. DIRECTOR GIPSON YOUR- PAY. AND YOUR- JUST WHAT YOU'VE EXPRESSED YOUR LOOKING IN THESE ALSO YOUR A THIS THIS. SO I KNOW THE YOU KNOW FOR HAND AND- DOC BIG SIMILAR. AND I ALSO THE FIRST WE GOTTEN FOR OUR EXTRA AND DOCTORS COOPER THE AN ALSO ME KING WHO I KNOW- HIMSELF WAS. HE'S NOT BEEN OUT OF- INCARCERATION FOR DOUBT LONG IT'S HE SAID KEEPS VERY CLOSE TAX WITH MANY. CARS INTO. SO I THINK WE HAVE HAD A ROBUST PANEL AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE SINCE. FROM EVERY ABOUT TRYING TO IT I LIKE SOME OR ANOTHER THERE LAW WORK. SYSTEM WE STILL JUST BEEN A TO. EARN WHATEVER IT SO I THAT WE IN THAT WILL HAVE TO SOME. ARE AS TO WHAT. COMMUNICATE WE MAY CHOOSE MAKE A SUBSEQUENT TO THE TO THE MINISTRY. I THANK YOU SAN SKINNER- MAY I JUST MAKE A FEW ROOM WITH WE MOVE ON OUR NEXT- AGAIN I THANK OUR- PANEL MEMBERS FOR YOUR- AND- THAT- WE DO HAVE A- A LARGE AND COMPLEX SYSTEM- I THINK KNOW CERTAINLY- CENTER SKI.

WITH THE NEW OF CODE GOING UP IN- BECAUSE AND OF COURSE INCLUDES CAL WE'RE DOING THAN OF THE BUT BUT YOU WERE NOT WE'RE STILL PART OF THE REST OF THE COUNTRY SO THAT HAPPENS US AND- I DO SO- WORRIES- CERTAINLY FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE PRESS TO NOW THERE FOR AND IN THEY NEED BE CAPS AND ALSO FOR THE CA IN WHICH THESE PRESENTS LOCATED WHERE THE IN WHICH THE STAFF LIVES WELL. AND SO- I GUESS MY- I GUESS I WOULD URGE- IF THERE'S POSSIBLE. AND I KNOW THE- EVERY DAY. BUT TO MAYBE SWIFT ACTION- BECAUSE WE ARE COMING UP- INTO SOME INTO THE HOLLOW. SO OR COME UP IN. SLOUGH SEASON. NINE ABOUT FLU VACCINE- WE'RE COMING UP IN TWO THE WINTER. AND- WEEK. THEM OF CASE. TO INCREASE. AS A RESULT OF THAT AND THAT'S WHY. PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES ARE GOING TO BE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT TO TRY TO KEEP THE NUMBER OF CASES DOWN IN COMMUNITIES AND OF COURSE THAT'LL FACT. EXPOSURE PEOPLE IN PRISONS AND CERTAINLY WHAT. CENTER SKINNER MENTIONED ABOUT THE RATE IN OUR PRISONS RIGHT NOW IS CERTAINLY VERY CONCERNING HOW HIGH IT IS COMPARED TO. THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY BUT THAT TO FEEDBACK LOOP IN THOSE COMMUNITIES RIGHT HI. RIGHT NOW PRISON MEANS HIGHER RATED COMMUNITY THEN FEEDS INTO IRATE PRESIDENT. SO AGAIN APPRECIATE THE DISCUSS.

STAND WARRANTS OR- MATTER IN JUROR. AND IN THE- FOR THE PURPOSES OF EARING ONE OF THE AGE INCLUDES THE FEDERAL IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT ALSO KNOWN AS ICE. BY WAY OF BACKGROUND I WILL BEGIN BY EXPLAINING OUR PROCESS. UPON RECEIPT OF AN INMATE TO A RECEPTION CENTER CITY SEE OUR STAFF COLLECTS AVAILABLE INFORMATION ABOUT AN INMATE DURING THE RECEPTION CENTER PROCESS WHICH IS WHEN AN INMATE IS PLACED IN CDC OURS CUSTODY AFTER ADJUDICATION BY A COURT OF LAW. THIS INFORMATION IS CRITICAL FOR THE DEPARTMENT AS IT HELPS US DETERMINE HOUSING ASSIGNMENTS PROGRAMMING OPPORTUNITIES RISK FACTORS AMONG OTHER THINGS. FOR INMATES WHO ARE FOREIGN BORN THE INFORMATION COLLECTED SUCH AS INMATES COUNTRY OF CITIZENSHIP AND PLACE OF BIRTH IS IMPORTANT TO ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO WORK WITH FOREIGN CONSULATES ESPECIALLY IN THE EVENT OF THEIR DEATH WHILE IN CUSTODY. IT MAY ALSO BE BENEFICIAL FOR THE INMATE AS ONE OF THE FORMS COMPLETED UPON RECEPTION IS A FORMER PRISONER TRANSFER TREATIES PROGRAM. THIS PROVIDES A NOTIFICATION TO THE AND MAY I HAVE THE RIGHT TO APPLY TO RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRY OF NATIONALITY. AS PART OF THE RECEPTION CENTER PROCESS THE INMATES COMMITMENT DOCUMENTS FROM THE COURT- AUDITED AND RECORDED IN OUR LIKE TRONIC SYSTEM TO ENSURE THE APPROPRIATE TERM AMOUNT IS SERVED. AND A RELEASE DATE IS CALCULATED FOR EACH PERSON. THIS INCLUDES RECORDING ANY LEGAL MANDATES THAT MAY BE REQUIRED DEPENDING ON THE CONVICTION TYPE SUCH AS REQUIRED REGISTRATIONS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT NOTIFICATIONS. AS PART OF OUR AUDIT PROCESSES AND THE INMATES CASE FACTORS BASED ON LEGAL DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM THE INMATE CASE RECORDS REVIEWS THE INMATES CRIMINAL HISTORY RAP SHEET TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL WARRANTS. OR OUTSTANDING CHARGES THE PERSON MAY HAVE THESE MAYBE UNTRIED CHARGES OR PROBATION AND PAROLE REVOCATION CHARGES CONTACT IS MADE WITH ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AT THE LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL TO INQUIRE ON THE ACTIVE WARRANTS WHICH MAY REQUIRE A DETAINER TO BE PLACED ON THE ENEMY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS COMMUNICATION IS FOR US TO KNOW WHETHER THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY PLANS TO PURSUE THESE ACTIVE WARRANTS ARE HOLDS. THE DETAINER ASSURES THE AGENCY WHEN THE INMATE IS ELIGIBLE FOR RELEASE CONTACT WILL BE MADE WITH THEM TO ARRANGE FOR TRANSFER OF CUSTODY TO THEIR JURISDICTION UPON RELEASE. IT IS ULTIMATELY THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES DECISION IF I TRANSFER OF CUSTODY WILL OCCUR UPON RELEASED OR NOT. THE DEPARTMENT'S ROLE IS TO PROVIDE THE NOTIFICATION PLACED A DETAINER EFFICIENT NOTIFY THE AND MADE OF THE DETAINER AND COORDINATE THE TRANSFER OF CUSTODY UPON THE INMATE SCHEDULED RELEASEDATE. THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT DETERMINE THE IMMIGRATION STATUS OF INCARCERATED PEOPLE IN OUR CUSTODY THAT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ICE. PRIOR TO PLACING A DETAINER ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY INCLUDING AN ICE MAY REQUEST TO INTERVIEW AND IN MAY. OUR DEPARTMENT COMPLIES WITH THIS REQUEST AND COORDINATES THE INTERVIEW BETWEEN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY AND THE PERSON. SENATE BILL FIFTY FOUR CDCR IS REQUIRED TO NOTIFY. AN INMATE IF THAT AN INTERVIEW WITH ICE IS VOLUNTARY AND THEY CAN HAVE THEIR ATTORNEY PRESENT.

THANK YOU MISTER VAN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I THINK THERE MAY BE SOME ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND- CENTERS ASK QUESTIONS WERE YOU MAY BE ABLE TO TALK FURTHER ABOUT YOUR STORY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING YOUR STORY. NEXT WE HAVE OUR NEXT WITNESSES- MONICA. WHEN THE RETURN FROM THE IMMIGRANTS- RATES STAFF IS AN IMMIGRANTS RIGHTS STAFF ATTORNEY WITH THE ACLU'S SAN DIEGO AND IMPERIAL COUNTIES. WELCOME THANK YOU SENATORS AND THANK YOU COMMUNITY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU TODAY. MY NAME IS MICHAEL AND ANYTIME THE IMMIGRANTS RIGHT STAFF ATTORNEY IN BC OF SANTA MONICA COUNTIES I REPRESENT PEOPLE DETAINED AT ALL TO ME SENT IMPERIAL. AND OTHER LANDS IMMIGRATION DETENTION CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA MUST CEASE ITS- VOLUNTARILY TRANSFERRING PEOPLE FROM JAILS AND PRISONS TO DEADLY ICE FACILITIES. IN CALIFORNIA'S LOCAL AND STATE PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES MUST EXERCISE THEIR AUTHORITY TO REGULATE THE SAFETY AND WELFARE. OF PEOPLE IN ICE CUSTODY DURING THIS PANDEMIC. THE EASILY AFFILIATES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE YOU TRIED MAJOR LAWSUITS CHALLENGING I'M GOING I SEE TENSION DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND ALL ICE DETENTION CENTERS IN THE STATE INCLUDING- TAMMY SAID IMPERIAL OTHER LANDAU INVESTMENT BANK. THROUGH THE COURSE OF LITIGATION WE LEARNED ABOUT CONDITIONS IN ICE DETENTION AND OF ICE AND PRIVATE FACILITY OPERATORS MISHANDLING OF THE PANDEMIC. IT'S CONFIRMED THAT WITHOUT CONSTANT INTERVENTION FROM ALL ANGLES POSSIBLE MORE PEOPLE MAY DIE IN A SUSPENSION. WE'VE LEARNED THAT IN CALIFORNIA IT NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN PEOPLE AND COUNTING HAVE TESTED POSITIVE FOR CARBON NINETEEN POLYNICE CUSTODY. AND AS WE KNOW DURING THE COURSE OF OUR LITIGATION IN SAN DIEGO ONE PERSON. KILEY SAID MR SCHOOL LED ME HERE BECAME THE FIRST PERSON TO TRAGICALLY AND UNNECESSARILY LOSE HIS LIFE TO COVER NINETEEN IN DETENTION AFTER ICE BOTH REFUSED TO RELEASE HIM AND FAILED TO DETAIN HIM IN A WAY. THAT WOULD. PROTECT HIM FROM DYING FROM THE VIRUS. FILIATION THE TEAM ORDERS DIRECTING THE- AND PRIVATE OPERATORS. TO IMMEDIATELY RELEASE MEDICALLY WONDERFUL PEOPLE FROM ATTORNEY SENT TO MASSIVELY DEPOPULATING THE LANDLORD TO LOVE THIS AND SAYING IN ORDER TO ESTABLISHING A RELEASE PROCESS AND PROHIBITING THE INTAKES AND A SEVEN MINUTE. ALL ORDERS WERE BASED ON THE COURT'S FINDINGS THAT WE WERE LIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THEIR CLAIMS THAT CONDITIONS OF CONFINEMENT. I DURING THE PANDEMIC IN THESE DETENTION CENTERS LIKELY VIOLATE PEOPLE'S RIGHTS TO FIFTH AMENDMENT DUE PROCESS. AS A RESULT WE SECURE THE RELEASE OF OVER FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY PEOPLE BUT ONLY WITH COURT INTERVENTION AND NOT WITHOUT FROM OBJECTIONS FROM ICE AND PRIVATE FACILITY OPERATORS. AT EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. FEDERAL COURTS TO MAKE FACTUAL FINDINGS IN SUPPORT OF THESE ORDERS INCLUDING THAT FIFTEEN PEOPLE CANNOT SAFELY PHYSICALLY DISTANCE AND THE FACILITIES. THAT DETAIN PEOPLE AND STAFF WHEN THEY HAD ACCESS TO MASK WE'RE NOT REQUIRED TO WEAR THEM. THIRTEEN PEOPLE HAVE THEMSELVES BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR CLEANING COMMON AREAS DURING A PANDEMIC WITH NOTHING MORE THAN DIRTY TOWELS AND BUCKETS OF DIRTY WATER. AWARDED TO ME SO WAS INITIALLY UNABLE TO ACCURATELY COUNT THE NUMBER OF MEDICALLY VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN HIS CUSTODY AS OUTBREAK RAVAGED THROUGH THIS FACILITY. CHRISTOPHER THEY'VE FOUND THAT ICE HAS BEEN DELIBERATELY INDIFFERENT TO THE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO TEN PEOPLE TO CALL THE NINETEEN. THAT IT ACTED WITH CALLOUS DISREGARD FOR THE SAFETY OF THE TEAM PEOPLE THAT THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES INSTITUTED IN RESPONSE TO THE OUTBREAK WERE INSUFFICIENT TO PROTECT MEDICAL WONDERFUL PEOPLE. AND THIS IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG LIKE THESE FINDINGS THERE ARE MANY MANY MORE. CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS ARE CATEGORICALLY UNSAFE AND IN DANGER AND FEDERAL IMMIGRATION DETENTION PARTICULARLY DURING THE PANDEMIC. THIS IS WHY WE MUST BE UNEQUIVOCAL THAT CALIFORNIA NOT ONLY ARES ABOUT IMMIGRANTS INTERSTATE BUT THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS A CLEAR ROLE TO PLAY IN ENSURING THAT MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITIES. ARE NOT CAUGHT IN THE CROSS HAIRS OF DEADLY ICE DETENTION. THERE'S NO LAW REQUIRING CALIFORNIA TO COMPLY WITH REQESTS THAT CDCR IN LOCAL JAILS TRANSFER PEOPLE TO ICE CUSTODY. ICE TRANSFERS ARE VOLUNTARY AND PEOPLE SUBJECT ICETRANSFERS HAVE BEEN DEEMED SUITABLE FOR RELEASE BY OUR STATE'S CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM THEY'VE SERVED THEIR TIME AND ONLY FACE INDEFINITE. DETENTION BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY WERE BORN. YES YOU SEE OUR AND LOCAL JAILS ARE THE PRIMARY SUPPLIERS OF THE TEAMS PEOPLE TO FILL BEDS AT ICE FACILITIES EVERY DAY. WHEN C. C. R. LOCAL JOBS VOLUNTARILY TRANSFER PEOPLE. TO ICE CUSTODY THEY'RE PLACING OUR CAN. MEMBERS OUR- ARE MEMBER IN THE- AND COST. TODAY CAN. THE SEATTLE DOES NOT CEASE. TRANSFER OF PEOPLE BECAUSE THE- FULL STOP. THIS IS ALL OCCURRING IN THE CONTEXT OF I. CITING ISSUED ITS OWN PANDEMIC. OF WHICH EXPRESS DIRECTED CENTERS. TO COORDINATE WITH LOCAL AND STATE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. YET TODAY WE'VE NOT SEEN PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS EXERCISE AUTHORITY OVER CALIFORNIANS IN ICE DETENTION MINISTRY TO WRAP UP PLEASE. FOR EVEN AS BECAUSE CLAIMED THE LIFE OF THE TEAM PEOPLE AND STATE. IS THERE IS. OF THE STATE OF. TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF IMMIGRANTS IN THAT STATE PARTICULARLY DURING A PANDEMIC IN WHICH IS RIGHT TO AN INDIVIDUAL AS A THREAT TO US ALL. WE ARE EXISTE CALIFORNIA AND UNNECESSARY TRANSFERS OF PEOPLE FROM JAILS AND STATE PRISONS TO DEADLY ISIS YLIDES AND TO EXERCISE THE AUTHORITY OF LOCAL AND STATE PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES TO REGULATE THE SAFETY AND WELFARE OF PEOPLE IN. CUSTODY DURING THE END OF IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND OUR FINAL PANELIST IS AMBER. MCKINNEY A PR- IT IS- AT THE WITH THE HEALTH INSTEAD OF PUNISHMENT PROGRAM DIRECTOR AND HEALTH IMPACT. PARTNERS- SO WELCOME. THANK YOU SHARE GONZALEZ SKINNER AND DOCTOR CAN AS WELL AS THE ESTEEMED MEMBERS OF THESE COMMITTEES. AS A PUBLIC HEALTH ORGANIZATION HEADQUARTERED IN OAKLAND HIP RECENTLY ANALYZED EXISTING PUBLIC HEALTH EVIDENCE AND INTERVIEWED DIRECTLY IMPACTED IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES TO UNDERSTAND HOW DIRECT TRANSFERS FROM CALIFORNIA PRISONS AND JAILS THE ICE AFFECT HEALTH. THE STUDIES DOCUMENT THE HEALTH HARMS OF CARCERAL SYSTEMS TO THOSE WHO ARE INCARCERATED OR DETAINED THEIR FAMILIES AND EVEN SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES. FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED HAVE HIGHER RATES OF CHRONIC DISEASE HORROR MENTAL HEALTH AND LOWER LIFE EXPECTANCY. AND PREGNANT PEOPLE WHO SIMPLY LIVING TOWNIES WITH HIGH RATES OF JAIL INCARCERATION ARE MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE PRETERM BIRTHS. WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT MANY IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES ARRIVE TO THE U. S. WITH TRAUMA WHICH UNFORTUNATELY CAN PAVE THE WAY FOR CRIMINALIZATION. WE PUT EXACTLY WHEN PEOPLE MOST NEED RESOURCES TO HEAL THERE INSTEAD POLICE AND FINAL TO JAILS. FURTHERMORE DEPORTATION OR THE THREAT OF DEPORTATION EXACERBATES HEALTH CONDITIONS LIKE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. RESEARCH ALSO SHOWS THAT CHILDREN WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR PARENTS DEPORTATION OFTEN EXPERIENCE WORSENED MENTAL HEALTH. A CENTRALLY THE PUBLIC HEALTH DATA ARE CLEAR JAILS PRISONS IN ICE DETENTION ARE ANTITHETICAL TO PUBLIC HEALTH. IT IS NOT A MATTER OF IF THERE WILL BE COPING NINETEEN OUTBREAKS INSIDE EVERY SINGLE CARCERAL FACILITY BUT WHEN. AND BECAUSE THE POOREST NATURE OF THESE FACILITIES THESE ALEX CAN ENDANGER AND OVERWHELM REGIONAL HEALTH SYSTEMS. IS TRANSFERS ARE THESE KEY PIPELINE TICE ATTENTION ABOUT 70% OF PEOPLE IN ICE CUSTODY ARE THERE BECAUSE OF A DIRECT TRANSFER. CALIFORNIA IS NOT A PASSIVE PARTICIPANT IN THIS PROCESS CALIFORNIA VOLUNTARILY AND ACTIVELY COLLABORATES WITH ICE IN THESE TRANSFERS. I NEED TO STATE ONE THING VERY PLAINLY. MUCH LIKE THERE'S NO TRULY HEALTHY AMOUNT OF LEAD TO CONSUME. AND THERE'S NO TRULY SAFE AMOUNT OF ASBESTOS TO BREEZE. THERE IS NO TRULY SAFE NOR HEALTHY WAY TO INCARCERATE PEOPLE WITHIN OR TRANSFER PEOPLE BETWEEN JAILS PRISONS IN ICE DETENTION CENTERS ESPECIALLY DURING A PANDEMIC MANY OR OTHERWISE. CALIFORNIA IS LITERALLY GAMBLING WITH PEOPLE'S LIVES. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE RESEARCH ALSO POINTS US TOWARD SOLUTIONS WITH CHILDREN FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THEY CAN RECOVER FROM TRAUMA IF THEY HAVE ADEQUATE SUPPORT INCLUDING CRUCIALLY STABLE RELATIONSHIPS WITH CAREGIVERS. LEASING COMMUNITIES LIKE CHAMPLIN BUNS ARE EAGER TO WELCOME THEIR LOVED ONES HOME. IN CLOSING I WANT TO THANK THE FORTY FIVE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE WHO HAVE URGED THE GOVERNOR TO TAKE EXECUTIVE EXECUTIVE ACTION TO STOP ICE TRANSFERS. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS OF THESE COMMITTEES WHO HAVE SPOKEN VOTED AND MARCHED TO AFFIRM THAT BLACK LIVES MATTER. BECAUSE OF SYSTEMIC ANTI BLACK RACISM IN THE CRIMINAL LEGAL AND IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT SYSTEMS D. CURSOR RATIONS AND STOPPING ICE TRANSFERS ARE CONCRETE WAYS TO USE YOUR STORY TO LEGISLATE. THAT BLACK LIVES MATTER. THIS HEARING IS JUST ONE SMALL STEP TOWARD RACIAL JUSTICE AND HEALTH EQUITY IN CALIFORNIA. I WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS ON OUR HEALTH IMPACT RESEARCH OR POLICY POSITIONS AND MY QUESTION FOR YOU TODAY IS WHAT COMMITMENTS CAN YOU MAKE HERE BECAUSE LEGISLATE STRUCTURAL SOLUTIONS THE END OF THE STATE'S COLLABORATION WITH ICE. TO RELEASE PEOPLE FROM JAILS AND PRISONS AND TO INVEST INTO COMMUNITY HEALTH INSTEAD OF PUNISHMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SO- WE'VE NOW HEARD FROM OUR PANEL WE WILL BE MOVING TO MEMBERS QUESTIONS BUT IS- BEFORE WE GO TO MEMBER QUESTION JUST REMINDER WILL BE TAKING PUBLIC COMMENT AFTER THE MEMBER QUESTIONS SO FOR THOSE.

MY UNDERSTANDING IS THEY DID SOME RATIONALE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE JURISDICTION OVER ARE YOU SIR SOMEONE TOPICS THEY ARE INVOLVED WITH CDCR AND SO I THINK IT'S COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. CDPH THIS IS.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR PATIENCE IS REALLY IMPORTANT THIS IS ABOUT LIFE AND DEATH. I THINK THAT WHAT- CCR IS DOING IN TERMS OF OUR FACILITATES NOTIFY YOUR FACILITATING THESE TRANSFERS ARE USED- IS OUTRAGEOUS. I THINK IT IS IN HUMANE PARTICULAR DURING THIS PANDEMIC TO GO ALONG WE KNOW THAT THESE ARE USED PRIVATE PRISONS DETENTION FACILITIES ARE COATED HOT BEDS. WE AS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT BE SENDING PEOPLE OVER THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE COMPLETED THEIR PRISON TERMS THEY HAVE DONE THEIR TIME. HE TURNED OUT TO SOCIETY WE SHOULD BE RE INTEGRATING THEM INTO OUR COMMUNITY I'M NOT. EXACERBATING THIS TRAUMA BY BY BY THE HEATING. AGENCY OF IT ARE YOU SAID IS STILL BROKEN- AND THAT FRANKLY IT HAS DONE A HORRIFIC JOB PROTECTING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE IN ITS CUSTODY AND WE ARE FACILITATING SENDING PEOPLE. INTO THAT SYSTEM WHETHER OR NOT THE PERSON IS ACTUALLY THE PORTABLE. AND I HAVE TO THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER HEARD CDCR EXPRESSED BY THE AGENCY. IT IS LEGALLY OBLIGATED TO DO BASICALLY ANYTHING BUT ICE ASKS THAT THE DEVICE IF I JUST ASK FOR SOMEONE. BEN BEN EIGHT GRAMS UCR'S SAYING WE'RE OBLIGATED TO NOTIFY THEM TO SOLITARY DO ALL THESE THINGS TO MAKE SURE THAT I JUST ABOUT WHO OVER THAT ONE.

WHERE ARE THE PART PUBLIC HEALTH THERE'S QUESTIONS A KEEN EYE GO AND CHECK OUT AND SURE THERE'S- AND- YOU. AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE HAVING BECAUSE CCR ACTIVELY TRANSFER PEOPLE. WHETHER THEY SHOULD GO THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THAT'S ONE QUESTION BUT CERTAINLY NOT INTO AN UNSAFE ENVIRONMENT. SO I APPRECIATE THAT. SO WE HAVE LINED UP FOR SPEAKERS SUFFER SERRA CAPIO DENSER GONZALEZ SO CENTER CAPIO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR I THINK THAT ISSUE FOR ME IS WHETHER- WHETHER OUR STATION WE USE FOR THESE DETENTION FACILITIES IN THE FIRST PLACE- AND- I KNOW THERE'S SOME. CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES ABOUT- OR SEPARATION BETWEEN FEDERAL AUTHORITY IN IN OUR OWN BUT- I THINK GIVEN THE WAY AGENCIES DID PRIVATE DEPENDENT DE DETENTION FACILITIES HAVE BEEN OPERATING AND- A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND THE ABILITY TO REALLY EVEN KNOW. HOW PEOPLE ARE BEING TREATED THERE HAS LONGBEEN AN ISSUE FOR ME BUT- I WE DO HAVE TO GET TO PUBLIC COMMENTS I'M GONNA BE VERY VERY BRIEF AND JUST SAY THAT- I APPRECIATE I ALSO APPRECIATE THE DETAIL- BY- CHIEF DIXON I WAS VERY HELPFUL JUST TO GET IT ALL LAID OUT IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS. I MEAN I WON IT- THANK AND RECOGNIZE AND CHECK ON BOND FOR HIS TESTIMONY HERE TODAY FOR SHARING HIS STORY SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND- THE PERSPECTIVE OF- THAT THAT'S VERY FAMILIAR TO ME HAVE OF REFUGEES COMING INTO THE COUNTRY AND TRYING TO- ASSIMILATING IN FACING. FACING SO MANY CHALLENGES SO THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SHARING. YOUR STORY- AND THEN IN REGARDS TO THE BOTH THE- MISS A LOT LANGRIDGE. LET LANGER ECA- AND- MISSED I CAN MEET PLOT IF YOU COULD GET US- THAT- ONE IS THE ANY LEGAL INTERPRETATION THAT YOU'VE GOT IN REGARDS TO- THE RELATIONSHIP THAT YOU FILL. OUT THE STATE SHOULD HAVE WITH- OUT BETWEEN- OUR DETENTION FACILITIES IN ANY PRIVATE FACILITIES- THAT ARE THAT ARE I SUGGEST THAT IS THAT WOULD BE GREAT AND THE HEALTH IMPACTS- SOME OF THIS INFORMATION IS NEW TO ME AND I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SEE- ANY OF THAT THIS STUDY THAT YOU. YOU REFERENCED- IT'S SERIOUS STUFF AND IF WE WANT. PEOPLE TO BE HEALTHY IN OUR COMMUNITIES IT'S UNDERSTANDING WHAT WHAT KIND OF PREVENTION MEASURES WE NEED TO UNDERTAKEN WHAT KIND OF CHANGES WE NEED TO MAKE TO THE SYSTEM SO. I WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU COULD- GIVE US. AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THAT INFORMATION THE FUTURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT'S ALL MISTER. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR HELLO GOOD. YES THANK YOU- MISTER THINK FOR OF THE PANEL FOR YOUR VERY- COMPREHENSIVE. DO YOU IN YOUR RESPECTIVE ROLES I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT I AM VERY MUCH- I TO A VERY CONCERNED I'M GONNA ADD MY VOICE TO MY COLLEAGUES BOTHSENATOR WIENER AND- SENATOR PAN- AND HOW WE CAN SORT OF WASH YOUR HANDS OF THIS THIS ISSUE- THE FIRST QUESTION I WILL- DIRECTED COURSES DID SHE DICKS AND- I'M WONDERING BECAUSE- UNFORTUNATELY CDPH DID NOT ATTEND AND WE WERE REALLY LOOKING FOR IT I'M- TENDING I THINK THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL LAYER. THAT IN MY OPINION THERE NEEDS TO BE OVERSIGHT AS WELL IN TERMS OF THE CONDITIONS NOT JUST IN OUR CURRENT PRESENTS BUT ALSO DETENTION CENTERS IF WE ARE TRANSFERRING FOLKS WHETHER WE BELIEVE. IT OR NOT- THERE SHOULD BE AN AT AND OVER OF. OUR LOCAL AGENCIES ARE KIND OF MANAGING AND LOOKING AT THE DETENTION CENTERS WERE TRANSFERRING PEOPLE TO. I'M HAPPY TO BE IN L. A. COUNTY WHERE THERE IS ACTUALLY A PLAN THAT WAS INSTITUTED IN APRIL BUT NOT EVERY COUNTY IS DOING THAT. SO I'M WONDERING I GUESS MY QUESTION CHU CHU SIX DIXON IS. ARE THERE ANY DISCUSSIONS WITH CD P. H. AS YOU'RE ENGAGING IN THESE TRANSFERS WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE VOLUNTARY YOU SEEM TO BELIEVE AND INTERPRET DIFFERENTLY. AND HOW TO. AS YOU'RE SENDING THESE CALIFORNIANS OVER. THAT THEY ARE UNSAFE I MEAN THAT IS THERE ANY WORK BEING DONE OR DISCUSSION WITH CD PH ON THE ARM. MAYBE DETENTION CENTERS. PROVIDING PLANS SO WHAT AT LEAST WE KNOW IT STATE. COMPLETELY DISAGREE WITH THE TRANSFER PROCESS BUT AT LEAST ENSURING THAT THESE DETENTION CENTERS HAVE SOME SORT OF. PARTICLES IF THERE IS I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY BUT THAT WOULD BE A LITTLE OUT OF MY SCOPE OF WHAT MY KNOWLEDGE AND RESPONSIBILITY IS SO I'M NOT AWARE. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THERE ISN'T ANYTHING I JUST I AM NOT AWARE OF ANYTHING. OKAY SO I THINK THAT JUST LEADS US TO BELIEVE THAT AGAIN WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUE OF TRANSFERS IT SEEMS AS THOUGH WE'RE WASHING OUR HANDS OF DATA WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHO- IS BEING TRANSFERRED WE DON'T KNOW. WHO HAS- NINETEEN- WHICH DETENTION CENTERS ARE WORSE OFF THAN OTHERS IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE ALL HORRENDOUS UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE NO PLANS FOR WHEN YOU'RE TRANSFERRING FOLKS THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE NO IDEAS WE KNOW THESE CALIFORNIANS ARE JUST BEING TRANSFERRED. IN A VERY DIRE SITUATION- MY ANOTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS. RELATED TO AND I DON'T BELIEVE YOU IT. ADDRESS THIS BUT- FOLKS WHO ARE YOU KNOW IN THE INMATES AND CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE MEDICALLY FRAGILE IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT. IN THE DISCUSSION OF TRANSFERRING IF YOU ARE COOPERATING TO YOUR INTERPRETATION WITH ICE. IS THERE ANY COMPASSION OR CONSIDERATION FOR INMATESWHO MIGHT BE THAT MEDICALLY BACK FRAGILE YOU'RE PUTTING THEM IN AN EVEN WORSE ENVIRONMENT. I CAN TELL YOU THAT- ICE AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AS WELL WILL SOMETIMES ASK FOR MAYBE CO GOOD INFORMATION OR MEDICAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR OFFENDERS AND THAT IS PROVIDED TO THEM BY OUR BY THE PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES AT THE INSTITUTION. AND IN SOME CASES- ICE OR AND ANOTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY ME CHOOSE NOT TO PICK UP THAT OFFENDER. OKAY IF THANK YOU FOR THAT AND YOU'RE WELCOME- AND IF ATTORNEY LANDRY GOT OR IS DIRECTOR PIATT HAS ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO ADD ON TO THIS WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE- IT AGAIN CLEARLY WE'RE- ON THE SAME TEACHER IN TERMS OF THE TRANSFERS AND THEY WERE EXACTLY WE- DON'T WANT TO HEAD- SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO ADD ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D- LIKE TO HEAR THAT. THANK YOU SENATOR GONZALEZ I CAN START AND THEN I CAN PASS IT OVER TO AND BURKE. JUST FIRST TO ADDRESS YOU KNOW CONNECTIONS FIVE ZERO TWO SIX EIGHT MY READING IS THE SAME AS AS THAT OF SENATOR WIENER IS A SAD FACT THAT PEOPLE COULD REALLY ADDRESSES. ONGOING REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS THAT SOMETIMES CAN HAPPEN WHILE PEOPLE ARE STILL INSTITUTIONALIZED IN CDCR CUSTODY IT MENTIONS. OF THE L. SOULS IT DOES NOT MEAN TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT MANDATORY COMPLIANCE WITH HOLDS NOTIFICATIONS OR FACILITATION OF TRANSFERS. IF THE READING WERE AS EXPENSIVE AS MYSTICS AND HAS- SHARE WITH US TODAY. THAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE IN CONFLICT WITH UPDATED GUIDANCE AND CDCR I BELIEVE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I'M THAT PROHIBITS HOLDS- YOU KNOW A START READING WERE RIGHT AND IT WOULD IT WOULD CERTAINLY CONFLICT TO SEE TO SEE OUR OWN GUIDANCE. AND A SENATOR WIENER POINTED OUT I WOULD CDCR IS- ALONE. HAD TESTIMONY ONE OF THESE HEARINGS. THE SECOND AB. WINDOW MAKE IS THAT YOU KNOW I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SORT OF OBSCURITY AND THAT THEY INDEED SEEMINGLY INTENTIONAL CONFLATION BETWEEN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. AND LAWS THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DOES NOT MEAN THAT SOMETHING IS LAWFUL AND IN FACT WE'VE SEEN. DURING THIS PANDEMIC THAT A LOT OF THEM ARE UNLAWFUL I'M A IN SO I AM I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE NUMBERS ABOUT THE OBSCURITY. I AND THEN IT. I SORRY THAT IF THAT IT READ WHERE IS OUR MISTAKES IN IT EXPANDS READING WERE CORRECT I THINK THAT WOULD INCOMES WITH THE INSTANCE THAT WE WILL A PEOPLE WHO NOT TRANSFERRED PEOPLE FOR WHOM CDCR DOES NOT FACILITATE TRANSFER NOTIFY ICE AND THEY'RE REALLY STATE SO I WHOLLY DISAGREE WITH STICKS IN THE READING OF THAT STATUTE IN A- A ENCOURAGED SEAT THE COMMITTEE AND ALL THE SENATORS CONTINUE LOOKING INTO THAT. MYSKINA FIAT. I'LL JUST ADD I WANT TO PROTECT AS MUCH TIME AS POSSIBLE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT SO I AM HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR OFFICES- SENATOR GONZALEZ AND CENTER COUPLE YOU DON'T WITH MORE INFORMATION ON THE HEALTH IMPACT RESEARCH THAT WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT YOU'RE FULLY EQUIPPED WITH THE HEALTH RESEARCH THAT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BE MAKING THESE DECISIONS AND MOVING TOWARD STOPPING ICE TRANSFERS FOR EVERYBODY. THANK YOU AND- MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANTED TO THINK- BOTH OF THEM- CHEAP DIXON AS WELL AS WELL AS CHAMPION BOND- HAVING A VERY LARGE CAMBODIAN COMMUNITY. I'M VERY GLAD THAT YOU'RE HERE TO SPEAK IN TESTIMONY AND YOU APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU CENTER GONZALEZ SENATE JACKSON. IT'S LIKE IT'S JUST BEEN A VERY INTERESTING DISCUSSION AND IT- I TO SURE- SOME FRUSTRATION. ON THAT WE'VE HEARD NOW DIFFERENT- INTERPRETATIONS OF WHAT THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITIES ARE WITH RESPECT TO ICE- I RECALL IT BEING FAIRLY CLEAR IN HEARINGS THAT WE'VE AD OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. DOES NOT SEE ITSELF AS AN EXTENSION OF ICE OR THE- A HORRIFIC EFFORTS THAT WE SEEN FRANKLY- BY PARTICULAR THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION- TO- REMOVE PEOPLE FROM THIS COUNTRY- AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE MADE IT. CLEAR IN OUR PUBLIC- SAFETY COMMITTEE HEARINGS AND OTHERWISE SO I WOULD LIKE- TO ASK THE COMMITTEE IS COMMITTEE- GOING FORWARD TO PLEASE. CONSIDER AND I HOPE YOU WILL- DOING SOME MORE OVERSIGHT OVER THE WAY- CDC. INTERPRETS ALL OR BELIEVES ITS RESPONSIBILITIES ARE- WITH RESPECT TO- AND PROVIDING INFORMATION TO ICE- WORKING WITH ICE- YOU KNOW WE HAVE DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN TO LIMIT ICE'S- ACTIVITIES WITHIN OUR COURT HOUSES FOR EXAMPLE EVEN THE CHIEF JUSTICE. MADE A VERY STRONG STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BECAUSE IT DOES IMPACT OUR ABILITY. TO DISPENSE JUSTICE PROPERLY- WHEN PEOPLE ARE AFRAID THEY WON'T COME TO COURT- FOR FEAR THAT ICE IS THERE WAITING TO BE PLUCKED THEM OFF- WE HAVE REQUIREMENTS NOW THAT. PEOPLE- WHEN THEY ARE IN A COURTROOM AND THE QUESTION ABOUT THEIR CITIZENSHIP FOR THEIR LAWFUL A PART OF PARTICIPATION HERE COMES INTO QUESTION THAT THEY WILL THEN BE ARE PERMITTED TO HAVE AN IN CAMERA PROCEEDING SO THAT THE PUBLIC ITSELF DOESN'T NECESSARILY GET TO HERE- JUST WHAT THEIR STATUS IS. I MEAN THE FACT THAT CDCR SAYS THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO COOPERATE I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE EXAMINED AND I AND I APPRECIATE CENTER WINNER YOU ARE CALLING ATTENTION TO THAT AND CERTAINLY- GIVEN GIVEN WHAT WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT THE HORRIFIC INHUMANE TREATMENT. OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ABSOLUTELY INCARCERATED SHE ONLY WAY YOU CAN DESCRIBE IT- IN THE SIZE FACILITIES I THINK THAT IS CONTRARY TO THE SPIRIT AND THE INTENT TO AND PROBABLY IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN THE ACTUAL LETTER OF THE LAW HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND IF IT'S NOT. THEN I SUGGEST THAT WE TAKE ANOTHER VIEW AND REQUIRE- MORE ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT OF CDC ARE- AS IT INTERPRETS THE LAWS THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAKES AND DOES CERTAINLY HAVE A MORE ROBUST DISCUSSION- SO. I AM. I AM HOPEFUL THAT GOING FORWARD THIS IS BEEN A MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITY TO IDENTIFY JUST EXACTLY THE EXTENT TO WHICH- CDC ARE OPERATES- WITH RESPECT TO THESE ISSUES AND FRANKLY OTHERS I KIND. AND VERY UNSETTLED BY THE FACT THAT THERE WERE EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO IDENTIFIED AS ELIGIBLE FOR EARLY RELEASE LOW RISK OFFENDERS AT CENTER AND A WHOLE EIGHTY WERE GRANTED THAT- EARLY RELEASE I MEAN THAT WE'RE C. COUNT ABILITY HERE. SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT COMMENT DESAI- RIGHT OFF INTO THE SUNSET- AND- I APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF THE PEOPLE WORKING WITH. CDC ARE IT'S A CULTURE. THAT I WE NEED X. AND I AND I KNOW THE PEOPLE THERE PARTICULAR PEOPLE BEEN ON TODAY- DO CARE DEEPLY ARE THERE DO TRYING TO DO THEIR BEST BUT I THINK THIS IS AN AREA WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO EXAMINE THE CULTURE OF CDC ARE- CAN AND ASK OURSELVES WHETHER THIS IS. THE WAY WE WANTED TO PROCEED IN THE FUTURE. SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OPPORTUNITIES. THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON- IT JUST. I ACTUALLY JUST WANTED TO GIVE- MISTER BOND- PERHAPS ONE FINAL OPPORTUNITY IF THERE WAS ANYTHING ELSE HE WANTED TO SHARE ABOUT HIS STORY I KNOW I HAD TO CUT HIM OFF BECAUSE OF TIME LIMITS BUT- MISTER BUNDY G.
