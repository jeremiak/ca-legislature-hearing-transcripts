OF CENSORSHIP OR RETALIATION.

01:05:18.614 --> 01:05:20.950
THAT MEANS THAT ACADEMIC FREEDOM

01:05:21.017 --> 01:05:23.219

01:17:54.102 --> 01:17:56.371
FIRST WE BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE

01:17:56.438 --> 01:17:57.839
SHOULD NOT IMPOSE CURRICULUM

01:17:57.906 --> 01:17:59.541

THE CSU FACULTY ARE HIRED FOR

THE DISCIPLINARY EXPERTISE THEY

01:18:08.016 --> 01:18:09.384
AND DEVELOP CURRICULUM.

01:18:09.451 --> 01:18:10.852
THIS BILL UNDERMINES THE PROCESS

01:18:10.919 --> 01:18:12.454
OF SHARED GOVERNANCE IT RELIES

01:18:12.521 --> 01:18:14.756
ON CAMPUSES AND FACULTY TO

01:18:14.823 --> 01:18:16.124

DEGREE IN GRADUATION

01:18:17.292 --> 01:18:18.293
REQUIREMENTS.

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.062
A LEGISLATIVE MANDATE SUCH AS

01:18:20.128 --> 01:18:21.063
THIS WILL SET THE DANGEROUS

01:18:21.129 --> 01:18:23.365
PRECEDENT OF ALLOWING GOVERNMENT

01:18:23.432 --> 01:18:25.200

OUR CAMPUSES AND FACULTY SAW A

01:18:38.346 --> 01:18:39.347

STANDALONE CAMPUS REQUIREMENT.

01:18:46.922 --> 01:18:48.490
MANY OF THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE

MET BY EXISTING COURSES IN

01:18:50.125 --> 01:18:52.094

MANY OTHERS.

01:18:58.767 --> 01:19:01.470
FINALLY SUCH A REQUIREMENT COULD

01:19:01.536 --> 01:19:03.271
ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ASSOCIATE

SINCE THEN OUR TWO SYSTEMS OF

01:19:30.232 --> 01:19:31.700
ANY CHANGE TO GRADUATION

01:19:31.766 --> 01:19:33.235
REQUIREMENTS IN THE CSU WOULD

01:19:33.301 --> 01:19:35.437
REQUIRE US TO REVIEW ALL OF OUR

THESE DEGREES.

01:19:41.243 --> 01:19:43.145
THIS COULD RESULT IN AN ADVERSE

01:19:43.211 --> 01:19:44.713
IMPACT ON TRANSFER.

01:19:44.779 --> 01:19:46.648

01:29:10.344 --> 01:29:20.822
THE IVORY TOWER SELDOM OPENS ITS

01:29:20.888 --> 01:29:21.389
DOOR UNLESS THE DOORS KICKED

01:29:21.456 --> 01:29:21.589
DOWN.

01:29:21.656 --> 01:29:22.523
AND THAT'S THE REALITY OF THE

01:29:22.590 --> 01:29:23.791
IVORY TOWER THE FACULTY THAT ARE

01:29:23.858 --> 01:29:24.625
AN ACADEMIC SENATE ARE BASICALLY

01:29:24.692 --> 01:29:25.793
THE FACULTY THAT IS REFLECTIVE

01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:26.561
OF THE INSTITUTIONS.

01:29:26.627 --> 01:29:27.829
AND SO THEREFORE THERE ALWAYS

01:29:27.895 --> 01:29:29.097
GOTTEN THAT DIDN'T NEVER GOING

01:29:29.163 --> 01:29:29.797
TO REALLY FULLY OPEN.

01:29:29.864 --> 01:29:30.631
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CURRICULAR OF

01:29:30.698 --> 01:29:31.466
CULTURAL STUDIES AT THE

01:29:31.532 --> 01:29:32.100
UNIVERSITY STEP TAKEN AND I'VE

01:29:32.166 --> 01:29:32.633
BEEN A PART OF THAT WHOLE

01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:33.234
DISCUSSION OF CULTURAL STUDIES

01:29:33.301 --> 01:29:34.535
AND WE KNOW THAT IT IS POSSIBLE

01:29:34.602 --> 01:29:35.837
TO GET YOUR DEGREE AT ANY

01:29:35.903 --> 01:29:37.105
UNIVERSITY AND NEVER TAKE AN

01:29:37.171 --> 01:29:38.740
ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE?

01:29:38.806 --> 01:29:39.340
YOU CAN TAKE A CULTURAL STORE

01:29:39.407 --> 01:29:41.809
COURSE OF SOUTHERN ITALY OR

01:29:41.876 --> 01:29:43.177
SUDDEN EUROPEAN AND THAT IS A

01:29:43.244 --> 01:29:44.746
CUT CULTURAL COURSE BUT IT STILL

01:29:44.812 --> 01:29:45.747
DOES NOT ADDRESS THE CRITICAL

01:29:45.813 --> 01:29:47.415
ISSUE OF THIS NATION IN THE

01:29:47.482 --> 01:29:49.317
HISTORY OF THIS NATION WITH

01:29:49.383 --> 01:29:50.485
REGARDS TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN

01:29:50.551 --> 01:29:50.852
HERE.

01:29:50.918 --> 01:29:52.687
WHO ARE EITHER AFRICAN AMERICAN

01:29:52.754 --> 01:29:54.622
LATINO API AND THE ISSUES OF

01:29:54.689 --> 01:29:56.090
RACE AND INTERSECTION BETWEEN

01:29:56.157 --> 01:29:58.126
RACE AND CULTURE IS EXTREMELY

01:29:58.192 --> 01:29:59.393
IMPORTANT IS QUESTION THAT HAS

01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:00.495
TO BE HAD?

01:30:00.561 --> 01:30:02.196
AT THIS AT THIS TIME AT THIS

01:30:02.263 --> 01:30:02.764
YEAR AT THE END AND AT THE

01:30:02.830 --> 01:30:04.866
UNIVERSITIES SO WE START TALKING

01:30:04.932 --> 01:30:05.767
ABOUT ACADEMIC FREEDOM IT IS

01:30:05.833 --> 01:30:06.400
STILL THERE.

01:30:06.467 --> 01:30:07.769
WE DO IMPOSE A NUMBER OF THINGS

01:30:07.835 --> 01:30:09.403
ON A UNIVERSITY WE IMPOSE AT

01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:11.639
LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS WE IMPOSE

01:30:11.706 --> 01:30:12.707
OF THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE TO

01:30:12.774 --> 01:30:13.708
TAKE AMERICAN HISTORY

01:30:13.775 --> 01:30:15.476
INSTITUTION REQUIREMENTS WE GIVE

01:30:15.543 --> 01:30:17.111
THE UNIVERSE IS THE FLEXIBILITY

01:30:17.178 --> 01:30:18.579
TO CHOOSE HOW IT IS TAUGHT.

01:30:18.646 --> 01:30:19.981
BUT WE BASICALLY REQUIRED THOSE

01:30:20.047 --> 01:30:21.282
ISSUES OUT OF THERE SO WHEN YOU

01:30:21.349 --> 01:30:22.750
BEGAN TO ACTS BUT ACADEMIC

01:30:22.817 --> 01:30:24.552
FREEDOM WE HAVE A BROAD BASE OF

01:30:24.619 --> 01:30:26.420
OF OF THINGS THAT WE JUDGE THAT

01:30:26.487 --> 01:30:28.055
WE HAVE THAT ARE PART OF IT.

01:30:28.122 --> 01:30:29.157
ETHNIC SO YOU SHOULD BE A PART

01:30:29.223 --> 01:30:30.258
OF IT IT CAN EASILY BE

01:30:30.324 --> 01:30:31.692
INCORPORATED IN THE CURRENT

01:30:31.759 --> 01:30:33.127
COURSES THAT ARE REQUIRED WE'RE

01:30:33.194 --> 01:30:34.462
NOT SAYING THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE

01:30:34.529 --> 01:30:36.197
A A STRICTLY STANDALONE ETHNIC

01:30:36.264 --> 01:30:37.565
STUDIES DEPARTMENT.

01:30:37.632 --> 01:30:38.232
IF YOU TEACHING HISTORY COULD BE

01:30:38.299 --> 01:30:39.367
TEACHING AMERICAN HISTORY TO

01:30:39.433 --> 01:30:40.968
VARIOUS LANDS IS AND WE SEE THAT

01:30:41.035 --> 01:30:42.804
NOW MANY CAMPUSES WILL DO THAT

01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:43.671
SOMEONE NOT.

01:30:43.738 --> 01:30:45.006
AND SO WHAT WE HAVE IS A HODGE

01:30:45.072 --> 01:30:46.808
PODGE OF REQUIREMENTS THROUGHOUT

01:30:46.874 --> 01:30:48.342
THE STATE BUT NOT NECESSARILY A

01:30:48.409 --> 01:30:49.944
FOCUS AND A REQUIREMENT THAT

01:30:50.011 --> 01:30:51.045
STUDENTS HAVE TO TAKE LEAST

01:30:51.112 --> 01:30:52.547
THREE UNITS OF ETHNIC STUDIES.

01:30:52.613 --> 01:30:54.382
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT K. TWELVE AND

01:30:54.448 --> 01:30:56.217
WE PASS IN K. TWELVE ISSUES WE

01:30:56.284 --> 01:30:58.252
DON'T HAVE THE FACULTY TO TEACH

01:30:58.319 --> 01:31:01.722
IT SAN DIEGO STATE OF OF SENEGAL

01:31:01.789 --> 01:31:04.158
CITY OF CITY SCHOOLS HAS A HAS

01:31:04.225 --> 01:31:05.293
ETHNIC STUDIES ON ITS BOOK YOU

01:31:05.359 --> 01:31:05.860
CAN TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES.

01:31:05.927 --> 01:31:06.828
BUT THERE ARE VERY FEW FACULTY

01:31:06.894 --> 01:31:08.563
WHO COULD ACTUALLY TEACH IT AND

01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:09.197
I REMEMBER WHEN IT WAS OFFERED

01:31:09.263 --> 01:31:10.231
IT'S AN EAGLE STATE WHEN I WAS

01:31:10.298 --> 01:31:11.599
CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT AND WHEN

01:31:11.666 --> 01:31:18.973
I WAS A PROFESSOR THERE WE

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:20.541
ACTUALLY WENT OUT AND HIRED

01:31:20.608 --> 01:31:21.075
SOMEONE FROM THE COMMUTER

01:31:21.142 --> 01:31:22.109
COLLEGE COME IN ONE DAY.

01:31:22.176 --> 01:31:22.944
A WEEK WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO DO

01:31:23.010 --> 01:31:24.011
THE TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES A ONE

01:31:24.078 --> 01:31:24.612
OF A HIGH SCHOOL THAT REQUIRE

01:31:24.679 --> 01:31:25.479
THAT REQUESTED IT.

01:31:25.546 --> 01:31:26.414
MAINLY BECAUSE THERE THERE WERE

01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:27.415
NO FACULTY ALL THAT COULD

01:31:27.481 --> 01:31:28.216
ACTUALLY TEACH THE COURSE WITH

01:31:28.282 --> 01:31:29.417
THE LEVEL OF COMPETENCY THAT IS

01:31:29.483 --> 01:31:30.251
REALLY CENTRAL.

01:31:30.318 --> 01:31:30.785
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ETHNIC

01:31:30.852 --> 01:31:31.385
STUDIES FOR EVER AND WE WILL

01:31:31.452 --> 01:31:32.520
CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT AND IT

01:31:32.587 --> 01:31:33.154
WILL COULD WE WILL CONTINUE TO

01:31:33.221 --> 01:31:33.754
BRING UP ARGUMENT OF ACADEMIC

01:31:33.821 --> 01:31:35.289
FREEDOM AND AND SO FORTH AND SO

01:31:35.356 --> 01:31:37.124
ON THE QUESTION IS IS IS GOOD

01:31:37.191 --> 01:31:38.059
FOR CALIFORNIA.

01:31:38.125 --> 01:31:40.094
IS A GOOD FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN

01:31:40.161 --> 01:31:41.429
CALIFORNIA WHO ARE CONFRONTED

01:31:41.495 --> 01:31:42.964
WITH AN EXTREMELY DIVERSE

01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:44.398
STUDENT POPULATION.

01:31:44.465 --> 01:31:45.766
WOULD BE GOOD FOR THOSE WHO ARE

01:31:45.833 --> 01:31:47.568
NOW INVOLVED IN THIS CHALLENGES

01:31:47.635 --> 01:31:49.070
WE HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT OF HEADS

01:31:49.136 --> 01:31:50.371
OF ETHNIC STUDIES CLASSES.

01:31:50.438 --> 01:31:51.405
AND SOME UNDERSTANDING OF THE

01:31:51.472 --> 01:31:52.974
DIVERSITY OF INDIVIDUALS BUT

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:54.442
ALSO UNDERSTANDING OF THEMSELVES

01:31:54.508 --> 01:31:56.043
IN THE BIASES THAT THEY BRING TO

01:31:56.110 --> 01:31:57.411
THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS.

01:31:57.478 --> 01:31:59.380
YES OUR TIME TO UNIVERSITY IS

01:31:59.447 --> 01:32:00.514
IT'S IT'S TIME TO DEGREE IS VERY

01:32:00.581 --> 01:32:02.283
VERY IMPORTANT WHAT I FOUND OVER

01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:03.684
THE YEARS AS THOSE STUDENTS WHO

01:32:03.751 --> 01:32:04.919
ACTUALLY TAKE ETHNIC STUDIES

01:32:04.986 --> 01:32:06.520
PARTICULARLY STUDENTS OF COLOR.

01:32:06.587 --> 01:32:08.055
ACTUALLY GET TIME TO DEGREE BUT

01:32:08.122 --> 01:32:08.556
A WHOLE LOT FASTER THAN

01:32:08.623 --> 01:32:10.358
EVERYBODY ELSE BECAUSE THEY

01:32:10.424 --> 01:32:11.259
ACTUALLY SEE THEMSELVES IN THE

01:32:11.325 --> 01:32:12.727
CURRICULUM THEY BEGIN TO

01:32:12.793 --> 01:32:14.562
UNDERSTAND THEIR RESPONSIBILITY

01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:16.564
TO CHANGE THEIR HISTORY AS WELL

01:32:16.631 --> 01:32:17.231
AS A CHANGE THE COMMUNITIES THEY

01:32:17.298 --> 01:32:17.865
COME FROM.

01:32:17.932 --> 01:32:19.734
SO I I REALLY APPRECIATE THE

01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:21.435
CONVERSATION WE TRIED YOU COULD

01:32:21.502 --> 01:32:23.170
SAY IS THERE A COMPROMISE IS A

01:32:23.237 --> 01:32:24.639
COMPROMISE THE COMPROMISE IS WE

01:32:24.705 --> 01:32:25.973
REQUIRE ETHNIC STUDIES BUT THE

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:26.807
INSTITUTION STILL GET AN

01:32:26.874 --> 01:32:28.376
OPPORTUNITY TO DECIDE HOW THAT

01:32:28.442 --> 01:32:28.542
IF.

01:32:28.609 --> 01:32:30.111
THAT IS GOING TO BE TAUGHT WHAT

01:32:30.177 --> 01:32:31.012
THE CURRICULUM IS GOING TO BE

01:32:31.078 --> 01:32:32.580
LIKE AND ACTUALLY HOW IT FITS

01:32:32.647 --> 01:32:34.482
INTO THE PATTERN OF THE

01:32:34.548 --> 01:32:35.383
UNIVERSITIES THAT THAT OF THE

01:32:35.449 --> 01:32:35.583
YEAR.

01:32:35.650 --> 01:32:36.717
WE HAVE THAT'S POINTED OUT EARLY

01:32:36.784 --> 01:32:37.685
WE HAVE THE MOST DIVERSE

01:32:37.752 --> 01:32:39.420
POPULATION OF STUDENTS IN THE

01:32:39.487 --> 01:32:40.922
WORLD RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:32:40.988 --> 01:32:42.456
IN OUR UNIVERSITIES AND YET WE

01:32:42.523 --> 01:32:44.692
FAIL TO ADEQUATELY REQUIRE AND

01:32:44.759 --> 01:32:45.793
SUPPORT THE MANY THINGS THAT WE

01:32:45.860 --> 01:32:47.094
THINK THAT ARE CENTRAL AND IT'S

01:32:47.161 --> 01:32:48.963
NOT JUST FOR ETHNIC STUDENTS IT

01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:50.498
IS FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS.

01:32:50.564 --> 01:32:51.933
OVER THE YEARS I'VE SEEN MY

01:32:51.999 --> 01:32:54.068
STUDENT POPULATION GROW FROM.

01:32:54.135 --> 01:32:55.469
A MAJORITY OF OF STUDENTS OF

01:32:55.536 --> 01:32:56.771
COLOR WHEN I WAS TEACHING

01:32:56.837 --> 01:32:59.040
UNIVERSITY OF WALKING AND IN IN.

01:32:59.106 --> 01:33:00.041
SEVENTY TWO OF THE MOST AFRICAN

01:33:00.107 --> 01:33:01.709
AMERICANS IN MY CLASS BY THE

01:33:01.776 --> 01:33:03.244
TIME I GOT READY TO RETIRE I CAN

01:33:03.311 --> 01:33:05.379
TELL WHO WAS IN MY CLASS WHEN I

01:33:05.446 --> 01:33:06.547
WALKED IN WHAT WAS MY CLASS OF

01:33:06.614 --> 01:33:07.648
THE CLASS NEXT DOOR.

01:33:07.715 --> 01:33:08.582
BECAUSE STUDENTS BEGAN TO TAKE

01:33:08.649 --> 01:33:10.518
ETHNIC STUDIES AND I AM PROUD TO

01:33:10.584 --> 01:33:11.886
SAY THAT MANY OF MY GRADUATES

01:33:11.953 --> 01:33:18.459
ARE VERY DIFFERENT GRADUATES

01:33:18.526 --> 01:33:19.860
WITH THE LAWYERS A DOT.

01:33:19.927 --> 01:33:20.928
BECAUSE THEY HAD A DIFFERENT

01:33:20.995 --> 01:33:22.029
LEVEL CURRICULUM WHEN THEY TOOK

01:33:22.096 --> 01:33:23.497
A MINOR OR JOINT MAJOR IN AFRICA

01:33:23.564 --> 01:33:24.165
IN ETHNIC STUDIES.

01:33:24.231 --> 01:33:24.832
MANY OF OUR MEMBERS ON THE FLOOR

01:33:24.899 --> 01:33:26.600
CREDIT THEIR SUCCESS. TO HAVING

01:33:26.667 --> 01:33:27.568
TAKEN AN ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE

01:33:27.635 --> 01:33:28.569
AT UNIVERSITY WHEN WE DID THE

01:33:28.636 --> 01:33:29.236
ETHNIC STUDY RESOLUTION THAT WAS

01:33:29.303 --> 01:33:29.437
HERE.

01:33:29.503 --> 01:33:30.237
THE REPORT THAT CAME BACK FROM

01:33:30.304 --> 01:33:31.706
THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WITH ALL

01:33:31.772 --> 01:33:32.406
THE VARIOUS ONES WAS A

01:33:32.473 --> 01:33:33.874
RECOMMENDATION FOR AN ETHNIC

01:33:33.941 --> 01:33:34.875
STUDIES REQUIREMENTS.

01:33:34.942 --> 01:33:36.544
OF WILL IT OPEN THE FLOODGATES

01:33:36.610 --> 01:33:37.778
FOR ALL KINDS OF OTHER THINGS I

01:33:37.845 --> 01:33:38.879
HAVE NO IDEA.

01:33:38.946 --> 01:33:40.214
I DON'T WE ARE HAVING BEEN AT

01:33:40.281 --> 01:33:41.215
THE MAYBE BECAUSE I'VE BEEN THE

01:33:41.282 --> 01:33:42.016
UNIVERSITY SO LONG I DON'T

01:33:42.083 --> 01:33:43.317
REALIZE IS THAT I DON'T SEE IT

01:33:43.384 --> 01:33:44.752
AS A SACRED INSTITUTION.

01:33:44.819 --> 01:33:46.187
THEY CAN'T CHANGE I KNOW IT NOT

01:33:46.253 --> 01:33:47.788
ONLY CAN'T CHANGE BUT IT HAS TO

01:33:47.855 --> 01:33:49.023
CHANGE IN ORDER TO MEET THE

01:33:49.090 --> 01:33:50.224
NEEDS OF ALL OF THE STUDENTS WHO

01:33:50.291 --> 01:33:52.126
COME TO THE UNIVERSITY.

01:33:52.193 --> 01:33:52.793
SO WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS

01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:54.128
FOR A WHILE.

01:33:54.195 --> 01:33:54.662
AND IT'S TIME FOR US TO

01:33:54.729 --> 01:33:56.797
BASICALLY PUT OUR THOUGHTS AND

01:33:56.864 --> 01:33:58.232
OUR HEART WHERE WE BELIEVE.

01:33:58.299 --> 01:34:00.001
AND BASICALLY BITE THE BULLET

01:34:00.067 --> 01:34:01.702
AND REQUIRE INSTITUTIONS HAVE

01:34:01.769 --> 01:34:03.704
ETHNIC STUDIES IS A REQUIREMENT

01:34:03.771 --> 01:34:04.071
FOR GRADUATION.

01:34:04.138 --> 01:34:04.939
MANY OF OUR CAMPUS WILL ONLY

01:34:05.006 --> 01:34:06.607
HAVE TO MAKE MODEST ADJUSTMENTS

01:34:06.674 --> 01:34:07.808
BECAUSE IT MANY OF THEM HAVE

01:34:07.875 --> 01:34:09.343
ETHNIC STUDIES DEPARTMENTS THEY

01:34:09.410 --> 01:34:10.678
COULD SIMPLY INCORPORATING THE

01:34:10.745 --> 01:34:11.545
G. REQUIREMENTS.

ATTENDANCE IS FOR A STUDENT

01:50:53.713 --> 01:50:55.382

OF THE THE THERE IS A HUGE

01:50:58.518 --> 01:51:00.253
INTRIGUE CREASING COLLEGE DEBT

THE NEED FOR REFORM IS NOW -- WE

01:51:12.332 --> 01:51:13.333
THE DEMOGRAPHIC OF THE STUDENT

01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:16.036

RIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL -- AND

01:51:23.209 --> 01:51:24.377
THE CURRENT SYSTEM DOESN'T

ACCOUNT FOR THAT WE CAN'T BE

AND WE'D LIKE TO IMPLEMENT THIS

02:03:19.058 --> 02:03:20.092
RIGHT AWAY.

02:03:20.159 --> 02:03:22.194
BUT CERTAINLY TO REVAMP OUR

02:03:22.261 --> 02:03:24.864
FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM. TO ADDRESS

02:03:24.930 --> 02:03:26.532

02:03:28.567 --> 02:03:32.171
ADDRESS THE TRUE COST OF OF OF

02:03:32.238 --> 02:03:33.706
OF COLLEGE WITH THE NON TUITION

02:03:33.773 --> 02:03:34.540

02:03:34.607 --> 02:03:35.941

TWO BILLION DOLLARS -- SO IT

02:03:38.644 --> 02:03:39.678
WON'T BE CHEAP.

02:03:39.745 --> 02:03:40.780
BUT WE THINK THIS IS AN

02:03:40.846 --> 02:03:42.515
IMPORTANT DIVERSE ONE OF THE

02:03:42.581 --> 02:03:44.416

SO WE THINK THAT WE CAN DO THIS

02:03:51.757 --> 02:03:53.125
OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS WE'RE

02:03:53.192 --> 02:03:55.761

02:03:58.798 --> 02:04:01.133
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POLICY

02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:02.802
CHANGE THAT WE NEED.

02:04:02.868 --> 02:04:04.837
TO TAKE A LOOK AT AS FAR AS THE

02:04:04.904 --> 02:04:05.771
CAL GRANT PROGRAM.

02:04:05.838 --> 02:04:06.939
IS MEANT AS WE STATED EARLIER

02:04:07.006 --> 02:04:08.073
IT'S BEEN TWENTY YEARS SINCE WE

02:04:08.140 --> 02:04:09.441

02:04:09.508 --> 02:04:11.377
ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM.

02:04:11.443 --> 02:04:13.312
AND EVERY YEAR WE HAVE THESE NEW --

02:04:13.379 --> 02:04:14.814
CAL GRANT TWEAKS AND BASICALLY

02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:16.382
OUR PROGRAM WE HAVE ALWAYS

02:04:16.448 --> 02:04:18.317
EXCLUSIONS.

02:04:18.384 --> 02:04:19.385
THE IT DID THERE ARE THERE ARE

02:04:19.451 --> 02:04:21.554
SO MANY -- OFFSETS OF THIS BILL

02:04:21.620 --> 02:04:23.322
WHO DOESN'T GET IT WHAT WE

02:04:23.389 --> 02:04:23.989

THIS WHO DOES GET IN CALIFORNIA

02:04:25.357 --> 02:04:26.625
SO THAT'S WHAT THIS.

IS ABOUT THE AND AND WORKING AND

02:04:28.994 --> 02:04:30.863
WORKING IN THIS THROUGH THE

02:04:30.930 --> 02:04:34.667

02:04:40.472 --> 02:04:41.207
THAT THAT THAT HIT RIGHT THERE

02:04:41.273 --> 02:04:42.875
WITH THE ANSWER IS THAT YOU KNOW

02:04:42.942 --> 02:04:45.010
THIS IS BEEN MANY MANY YEARS IN

02:04:45.077 --> 02:04:46.478
THE MAKING WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT

02:04:46.545 --> 02:04:47.580
TWEAKING.

02:04:47.646 --> 02:04:49.615

02:05:02.828 --> 02:05:04.496
AND SO WE THIS IS A HOLISTIC

02:05:04.563 --> 02:05:06.765
VIEW OF STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA

02:05:06.832 --> 02:05:08.267

02:05:12.538 --> 02:05:13.339
VERY DIFFERENT.

02:05:13.405 --> 02:05:15.107

02:05:36.395 --> 02:05:37.296
PIECES OF THIS BECAUSE THE

AVERAGE STUDENT DEBT LOAD IS

02:05:39.431 --> 02:05:40.866

STUDENT TUITION.

02:15:38.463 --> 02:15:39.831
ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL WOULD

ALLOW FOR MEANINGFUL PUBLIC

02:16:06.958 --> 02:16:08.360
AS THE AUTHOR MENTIONED JUST

ACROSS THE BOARD PAY INCREASE

02:16:13.832 --> 02:16:15.133
FOR EXECUTIVES.

02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:16.968
THIS ACTION ALONG WITH MANY

02:16:17.035 --> 02:16:18.403
OTHER PAST ACTIONS HAS

02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:20.472
DEMONSTRATED AN INSENSITIVITY TO

02:16:20.539 --> 02:16:22.374
THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND IT

02:16:22.440 --> 02:16:24.109
SHOWS THE CSU BOARD THE BOARD OF

02:16:24.175 --> 02:16:26.011
TRUSTEES TO BE OUT OF STEP WITH

02:16:26.077 --> 02:16:27.846
WHAT THE PUBLIC EXPECTS OF

02:16:27.913 --> 02:16:31.616
PUBLIC SERVICE.

02:16:31.683 --> 02:16:32.918
WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE GREATER

02:16:32.984 --> 02:16:34.085
PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY AND

02:16:34.152 --> 02:16:35.353
TRANSPARENCY OF THE BOARD OF

02:16:35.420 --> 02:16:36.855
TRUSTEES AND SEE THAT THEY

02:16:36.922 --> 02:16:38.890
PRIORITIZE STUDENTS OVER

02:16:38.957 --> 02:16:40.692
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.

02:16:40.759 --> 02:16:42.661
FINALLY THIS MEASURE REQUIRES

02:16:42.727 --> 02:16:44.362
EACH OF THE TWENTY THREE CSU

02:16:44.429 --> 02:16:46.197
CAMPUSES TO SUBMIT QUARTERLY

02:16:46.264 --> 02:16:48.700
BUDGET COMPARISON REPORTS TO THE

02:16:48.767 --> 02:16:50.101
CSU CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE

02:16:50.168 --> 02:16:50.402
[inaudible]

02:16:50.468 --> 02:16:53.338
A AB NINE THIRTY IS A BILL THAT

02:16:53.405 --> 02:16:54.272
WILL BRING GREATER FISCAL

02:16:54.339 --> 02:16:56.508
ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY

02:16:56.575 --> 02:16:59.311
TO THE USUAL WAY OF THE CSU

02:16:59.377 --> 02:17:00.312
BOARD OF TRUSTEES.

02:17:00.378 --> 02:17:01.646
THAT IS THE USUAL WAY THEY DO

02:17:01.713 --> 02:17:02.514
BUSINESS.

02:17:02.581 --> 02:17:04.849
THE LAW IS CLEAR THE CSU IS

02:17:04.916 --> 02:17:06.451
SUBJECT TO FULL LEGISLATIVE

02:17:06.518 --> 02:17:08.653
CONTROL UNDER STATUTE AND ALL OF

02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:10.221
CS USE EXEMPT EMPLOYEES ARE

02:17:10.288 --> 02:17:11.489
STATE EMPLOYEES.

02:17:11.556 --> 02:17:13.224
THE CSU IS NOT A PRIVATE SECTOR

02:17:13.291 --> 02:17:15.093
ENTITY THAT IS SUBJECT TO THE

02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:16.695
FREE MARKET.

02:17:16.761 --> 02:17:18.496
IT IS A PUBLIC ENTITY MAKE

02:17:18.563 --> 02:17:19.764
FUNDED THROUGH STUDENTS AND

02:17:19.831 --> 02:17:21.566
THEIR FAMILIES -- THROUGH

02:17:21.633 --> 02:17:22.968
TUITION DOLLARS AND TAXPAYER

02:17:23.034 --> 02:17:24.736
DOLLARS TO THE GENERAL FUND AND

02:17:24.803 --> 02:17:27.439
IT IS OPERATED BY PUBLIC

02:17:27.505 --> 02:17:28.306
EMPLOYEES.

02:17:28.373 --> 02:17:29.507
IT IS CLEAR THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:17:29.574 --> 02:17:31.176
HAS DELEGATED AUTHORITY TO THE

02:17:31.242 --> 02:17:32.944
TRUSTEES MEANING THAT THE

02:17:33.011 --> 02:17:34.346
TRUSTEES CAN DETERMINE EXECUTIVE

02:17:34.412 --> 02:17:36.681
PAY BUT ONLY BECAUSE THE

02:17:36.748 --> 02:17:38.216
LEGISLATUREHAS DELEGATED THAT

02:17:38.283 --> 02:17:39.718
AUTHORITY TO THEM.

02:17:39.784 --> 02:17:41.219
THE LEGISLATURE CAN AT ANY TIME

02:17:41.286 --> 02:17:43.088
MAKE CHANGES TO THAT AUTHORITY

02:17:43.154 --> 02:17:44.389
OR PUT CONDITIONS ON THAT AT THE

02:17:44.456 --> 02:17:45.123
READY.

02:17:45.190 --> 02:17:46.625
AND THAT IS WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY

02:17:46.691 --> 02:17:48.693
ON BEHALF OF AB NINE THIRTY TO

02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:50.161
SEE GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY AND

02:17:50.228 --> 02:17:51.963
TRANSPARENCY OF THE CSU BOARD OF

02:17:52.030 --> 02:17:53.765
TRUSTEES AND HOW THEY OPERATE

02:17:53.832 --> 02:17:55.934
WHEN VOTING FOR EXECUTIVE.

02:17:56.001 --> 02:17:57.302
COMPENSATION INCREASES.

02:17:57.369 --> 02:17:58.370
I'D LIKE TO REMIND THE MIDI

02:17:58.436 --> 02:17:59.671
COMMITTEE THAT THE MAIN PURPOSE

02:17:59.738 --> 02:18:01.172
OF THE CSU IS TO PROVIDE

02:18:01.239 --> 02:18:03.074
AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE PUBLIC

02:18:03.141 --> 02:18:04.809
EDUCATION TO OUR CALIFORNIA

02:18:04.876 --> 02:18:06.244
STUDENTS. FOR THE MORE THE

02:18:06.311 --> 02:18:08.313
QUARTERLY BUDGET REPORTING PIECE

02:18:08.380 --> 02:18:10.015
OF THE BILL IS NOT DUPLICATIVE.

02:18:10.081 --> 02:18:12.017
THE WAY IN WHICH IN WHICH THE

02:18:12.083 --> 02:18:13.952
CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES DISPERSES

02:18:14.019 --> 02:18:15.553
ITS ANNUAL GENERAL FUND

02:18:15.620 --> 02:18:17.088
ALLOCATION TO EACH CAMPUS.

02:18:17.155 --> 02:18:18.790
IS OPAQUE CERTAINLY TO THOSE OF

02:18:18.857 --> 02:18:21.660
US TO KEEP AN EYE ON IT AND HOW

02:18:21.726 --> 02:18:22.927
EACH CAMPUS MANAGES THAT UP BY

02:18:22.994 --> 02:18:24.462
LOCATION THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.

02:18:24.529 --> 02:18:26.131
IS VERY DIFFICULT TO TRACK TO

02:18:26.197 --> 02:18:27.365
ENSURE THAT BASIC STUDENT

02:18:27.432 --> 02:18:28.800
PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT ARE

02:18:28.867 --> 02:18:30.969
REQUIRED. TO BE FUNDED THROUGH

02:18:31.036 --> 02:18:33.204
TUITION ACTUALLY ARE FUNDED IN

02:18:33.271 --> 02:18:34.739
WAYS THEY SHOULD BE.

02:18:34.806 --> 02:18:36.708
THIS AGAIN POINTS TO LACK OF AND

02:18:36.775 --> 02:18:38.343
AND TO LACK OF IN GREATER NEED

02:18:38.410 --> 02:18:40.345
FOR FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND

02:18:40.412 --> 02:18:41.846
TRANSPARENCY OF THE CSU.

02:18:41.913 --> 02:18:44.282
WE VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO

02:18:44.349 --> 02:18:45.450
WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE

02:18:45.517 --> 02:18:47.152

AS YOU KNOW TUITION FOR THE CSU

02:19:20.452 --> 02:19:22.487
SYSTEM HAS INCREASED

02:19:22.554 --> 02:19:23.922
DRAMATICALLY IN RECENT YEARS.

02:19:23.988 --> 02:19:25.857
AND AT THE SAME TIME SO HAVE

02:19:25.924 --> 02:19:28.560
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PACKAGES.

02:19:28.626 --> 02:19:30.295
BECAUSE OF THAT WE ARE PLEASED

02:19:30.361 --> 02:19:31.596
TO SEE THAT THIS BILL ENCOURAGES

02:19:31.663 --> 02:19:33.631
FOR TRANSPARENCY IN OUR SYSTEM

02:19:33.698 --> 02:19:35.133
BY ACQUIRING THE BOARD OF

02:19:35.200 --> 02:19:36.067
TRUSTEES TO INCLUDE.

02:19:36.134 --> 02:19:38.269

PRIOR TO BEING CONSIDERED FOR A

02:19:46.010 --> 02:19:47.479
VOTE IN THE NEXT MEETING.

02:19:47.545 --> 02:19:49.881
AT THE SAME TIME THERE SHOULD BE

02:19:49.948 --> 02:19:51.182
NO DOUBT WHATSOEVER THAT WE

02:19:51.249 --> 02:19:52.951
VALUE OUR EXECUTIVES

02:19:53.017 --> 02:19:54.686

APPRECIATE MY CAMPUS PRESIDENT.

02:19:56.821 --> 02:19:58.289
BUT I THINK HIS ROLE OUR

02:19:58.356 --> 02:19:59.524
UNIVERSITY HAS BEEN

02:19:59.591 --> 02:20:01.993
TRANSFORMATIVE AND INVALUABLE.

02:20:02.060 --> 02:20:02.827
THERE'S NO BIGGER

02:20:02.894 --> 02:20:04.462
DISILLUSIONMENT FOR STUDENTS

02:20:04.529 --> 02:20:05.497
HOWEVER.

02:20:05.563 --> 02:20:07.632
THEN TO SUCCESSFULLY ADVOCATE TO

02:20:07.699 --> 02:20:09.467
OUR STATE LEGISLATURE AND TO OUR

02:20:09.534 --> 02:20:11.436
GOVERNOR -- FOR THE ADEQUATE

02:20:11.503 --> 02:20:13.471
FUNDS TO RESOURCE ARE

02:20:13.538 --> 02:20:15.673
EDUCATION'S ONLY TO HAVE THESE

02:20:15.740 --> 02:20:17.809
FUNDS -- USED FOR EXECUTIVE

02:20:17.876 --> 02:20:19.811
SALARY INCREASES RATHER THAN

02:20:19.878 --> 02:20:21.713
AGAIN SAID EGGS EDUCATIONAL

02:20:21.780 --> 02:20:22.747
RESOURCES.

02:20:22.814 --> 02:20:24.649
IN FACT THIS YEAR THE CSSA BOARD

02:20:24.716 --> 02:20:28.353
APPROVED TO PRIOR RESOLUTIONS.

02:20:28.419 --> 02:20:29.888
TO ADDRESS THESE EXACT ISSUES.

02:20:29.954 --> 02:20:31.689
TO CLARIFY THIS IS NOT AN EITHER

02:20:31.756 --> 02:20:34.192
OR SITUATION IF CIRCUMSTANCES

02:20:34.259 --> 02:20:36.594
ARE SO DIRE THAT ARE CSU BOARD

02:20:36.661 --> 02:20:38.396
OF TRUSTEES NEEDS TO CONSIDER OR

02:20:38.463 --> 02:20:39.731
EVEN IMPLEMENT.

02:20:39.798 --> 02:20:41.466
A STUDENT TUITION INCREASE THANK

02:20:41.533 --> 02:20:43.334
CLEARLY THERE SHOULDN'T BE --

02:20:43.401 --> 02:20:45.170
ANY MONEY AVAILABLE TO INCREASE

02:20:45.236 --> 02:20:48.640
THE SALARIES OF OUR

02:20:48.706 --> 02:20:49.741
ADMINISTRATORS.

02:20:49.808 --> 02:20:50.308
I REMEMBER VISITING THE CSU

02:20:50.375 --> 02:20:51.476
WEBSITE EARLIER THIS YEAR FOR

02:20:51.543 --> 02:20:52.677
SOMETHING -- AND I'VE BEEN

02:20:52.744 --> 02:20:54.112
READING A VERY POWERFUL MISSION

02:20:54.179 --> 02:20:56.214
STATEMENT THAT REALLY SPOKE TO

02:20:56.281 --> 02:20:56.381
ME.

02:20:56.447 --> 02:20:58.449
AND IT'S DEFINED STUDENT SUCCESS

02:20:58.516 --> 02:21:00.051
PARTIALLY AS MAKING COLLEGE MORE

02:21:00.118 --> 02:21:03.188
AFFORDABLE TO MORE CALIFORNIANS.

02:21:03.254 --> 02:21:05.423
I LOOK AT THAT WHEN WE COULD SEE

02:21:05.490 --> 02:21:07.292
CONTINUING RAISES TO SEE CSU

02:21:07.358 --> 02:21:08.493
STUDENT TUITION.

02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:10.862
AND HOW THIS DOES NOT DELIVER TO

02:21:10.929 --> 02:21:13.932
THE PROMISE NOR CORE PRINCIPLES --

02:21:13.998 --> 02:21:15.433
WHEN WE DO THINGS LIKE THIS I'M

02:21:15.500 --> 02:21:16.534
ESPECIALLY WHEN INCREASING

02:21:16.601 --> 02:21:18.269
SALARIES WHICH DEVIATES EVEN

02:21:18.336 --> 02:21:19.771
FARTHER FROM OUR OVERALL

02:21:19.838 --> 02:21:21.406
PROGRESS?

02:21:21.472 --> 02:21:21.973
BUT IT'S REALLY AN ETHICAL

02:21:22.040 --> 02:21:22.907
APPEAL.

02:21:22.974 --> 02:21:24.576
WE JUST ASK THAT THERE BE AN

02:21:24.642 --> 02:21:26.878
ETHICAL CONSIDERATION AS TO THE

02:21:26.945 --> 02:21:28.680
OVERALL BUDGET PROCESS AND

02:21:28.746 --> 02:21:30.415
STUDENT RIGHTS.

02:21:30.481 --> 02:21:33.051

RESPECTFULLY BE OPPOSED TO THIS

02:22:17.095 --> 02:22:19.197
MEASURE -- WE DON'T SEE A

02:22:19.264 --> 02:22:21.332
CORRELATION BETWEEN WHAT.

02:22:26.004 --> 02:22:26.838
WHAT THE CONNECTION IS BETWEEN

02:22:33.144 --> 02:22:35.513
STATE WE CONSIDER TUITION

02:22:35.580 --> 02:22:36.314
THE FACT THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:22:36.381 --> 02:22:38.583
AND GOVERNOR HAVE PROVIDED

02:22:38.650 --> 02:22:39.484
FUNDING FOR US THIS YEAR.

02:22:39.550 --> 02:22:40.118
AND THERE WILL BE A TUITION FEE

02:22:40.184 --> 02:22:43.655
INCREASE THIS YEAR FOR STUDENTS --

02:22:43.721 --> 02:22:44.989
FRANKLY TUITION AT THE CSU HAS

02:22:45.056 --> 02:22:47.859
BEEN REMAIN FLAT FOR THE LAST --

02:22:47.926 --> 02:22:48.860
EIGHT SEVENTY YEARS BUT WE HAVE

02:22:48.927 --> 02:22:50.728
INCREASED TUITION A RELATIVELY

02:22:50.795 --> 02:22:53.231
MODESTLY Là LAST YEAR -- AND

02:22:53.298 --> 02:22:54.799
THAT WAS TO ADDRESS GRADUATION

02:22:54.866 --> 02:22:56.968
IS DEPOSED ALTER SUPPOSEDLY

02:22:57.035 --> 02:22:58.836
SPELL FOR GRADUATION INITIATIVE.

02:22:58.903 --> 02:23:00.338
WE HAVE INCREASED -- WE HAVE

02:23:00.405 --> 02:23:01.239
GIVEN COMPETITION POLLS TO OUR

02:23:01.306 --> 02:23:03.207
EMPLOYEES ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES --

02:23:03.274 --> 02:23:04.575
CLICK A BARGAIN BOYS AND OUR

02:23:04.642 --> 02:23:06.044

02:23:06.110 --> 02:23:06.611
THE COMPETITION PROVIDED FOR

02:23:06.678 --> 02:23:07.745
EXECUTIVES.

02:23:07.812 --> 02:23:10.081
IS AT A AT A RATE LOWER ART AT

02:23:10.148 --> 02:23:11.649
THE SAME RATE AS WE GET INTO OUR

02:23:11.716 --> 02:23:13.051

02:23:13.117 --> 02:23:14.085
WE THINK WE'VE BEEN GOOD

02:23:14.152 --> 02:23:15.353
STEWARDS WITH THE STATE'S

02:23:15.420 --> 02:23:17.055
DOLLARS WE'VE BEEN RESPONSIVE.

02:23:17.121 --> 02:23:18.489
AND I THINK THAT THIS BILL

02:23:18.556 --> 02:23:19.424
PUNISHES THE SYSTEM FOR

02:23:19.490 --> 02:23:21.726
SOMETHING I'M NOT REALLY SURE

02:23:21.793 --> 02:23:23.294
THAT WE'VE DONE WRONG. FOR THAT

02:23:23.361 --> 02:23:24.028
REASON WE MUST BE OPPOSE THE

02:23:24.095 --> 02:23:25.063
MEASURE AND THEN FRANKLY THE

02:23:25.129 --> 02:23:26.197
OTHER ISSUE IS THE COURT

02:23:26.264 --> 02:23:27.398
REPORTING WE WE DON'T HONESTLY

02:23:27.465 --> 02:23:28.900

02:23:33.371 --> 02:23:34.038
COMMITTEES.

02:23:34.105 --> 02:23:35.740
EVER YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT

02:23:35.807 --> 02:23:37.508

SPEND OUR TO OUR EXPENDITURES.

02:23:38.209 --> 02:23:39.944
SO WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT IT IS THE

02:23:40.011 --> 02:23:41.779
ADDITIONAL VALUE OF THE COURT

02:23:41.846 --> 02:23:43.247

02:24:07.739 --> 02:24:08.806
STRONG CONCERNS I'M HOT FOR THE

CHAIR BUT I THINK YOU KNOW MY

02:24:10.141 --> 02:24:11.309

THE CSU SYSTEM ABOUT ME THESE

THINGS ARE CONNECTED -- TO SAY

02:24:17.415 --> 02:24:18.649
THE TUITION AND EXECUTIVE PAY

02:24:18.716 --> 02:24:22.086
ARE NOT CONNECTED -- I THINK IS

02:24:22.153 --> 02:24:23.521
IS IS.

02:24:23.588 --> 02:24:24.522
HARD TO MAKE THAT CONNECTION I

02:24:24.589 --> 02:24:25.356
MEAN HARD TO HARD TO MAKE THAT

02:24:25.423 --> 02:24:26.357
CONCLUSION OF A FOR ASKING

02:24:26.424 --> 02:24:28.493
STUDENTS TO PAY MORE -- WHAT

02:24:28.559 --> 02:24:29.560
SOME OF HIS HE RAISING EXECUTIVE

02:24:29.627 --> 02:24:30.995

02:24:31.596 --> 02:24:33.164
DISTRICTS EXPLAIN -- I THINK

02:24:33.231 --> 02:24:34.198
WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR WORK

02:24:34.265 --> 02:24:35.333
CERTAINLY ALLOWING THE CSU TO

02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:36.267
CONTINUE TO MAKE THOSE

02:24:36.334 --> 02:24:37.602
ADJUSTMENTS THIS YEAR THEY'RE

02:24:37.668 --> 02:24:39.037
NOT A FORECAST NAY TUITION

02:24:39.103 --> 02:24:40.772
INCREASE -- SO THEREFORE THEY

02:24:40.838 --> 02:24:43.274
CAN INCREASE EXECUTIVE SALARIES --

02:24:43.341 --> 02:24:45.376
BUT I THINK THE ABILITY TO HAVE

02:24:45.443 --> 02:24:46.310
TRANSPARENCY AROUND THOSE

02:24:46.377 --> 02:24:47.412

A TUITION INCREASE EXACTLY PAY

02:24:53.918 --> 02:24:54.118
INCREASE.

02:24:54.185 --> 02:24:55.353

02:33:23.594 --> 02:33:25.029
KNOWLEDGE THAT'S THAT THOUGH YOU

02:33:25.095 --> 02:33:26.564
ARE TRYING TO ADD THE AND NOT

02:33:26.630 --> 02:33:28.699
THE I MEAN THIS IS A GOOD CASA I

02:33:41.979 --> 02:33:44.715
TAG THAT HAS BEEN NOT CALCULATED

02:33:44.782 --> 02:33:46.116
FOR IMPLEMENTING THIS BE AND HOW

02:33:46.183 --> 02:33:47.418
MUCH I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU

02:33:49.787 --> 02:33:52.690
THAT THIS ANALYSS AS NOAH.

02:33:52.756 --> 02:33:54.058
UPON THE MOUNT THE HAS BEEN

02:33:54.124 --> 02:33:55.392
DISCLOSED.

02:33:55.459 --> 02:33:57.428
SO I DON'T KNOW WHEN -- WITH --

02:33:57.494 --> 02:34:02.266
DISTORT THE GOOD IDEA. TO HAD A

02:34:02.333 --> 02:34:04.768
SEVERAL HUNDRED BILLIONS OF

02:34:04.835 --> 02:34:06.503

02:34:06.570 --> 02:34:07.805
RATHER THAN NOT LEAVING ARE

02:34:07.871 --> 02:34:15.212
LOCALLY OF FOR EXAMPLE -- IT.

02:34:15.279 --> 02:34:16.981
HI IN THE AREA THAT I COME FROM

02:34:17.047 --> 02:34:18.716
MARCH IRVINE UNIFIED SCHOOL

02:34:18.782 --> 02:34:21.151

02:34:27.491 --> 02:34:30.060
SO.

02:34:30.127 --> 02:34:30.594
I KNOW IT IS A STRUGGLE.

02:34:30.661 --> 02:34:32.329
BUT NOW WHEN WE TRY TO IMPLEMENT

02:34:32.396 --> 02:34:34.765
THIS OF THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

02:34:34.832 --> 02:34:36.233
THIS REGARDING THE LOCAL

02:34:36.300 --> 02:34:36.934
SITUATION.

02:34:37.001 --> 02:34:37.901
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS IS THE

02:34:37.968 --> 02:34:39.236
ANSWER.

02:34:39.303 --> 02:34:39.903
WELL I THINK THERE COUPLE

02:34:39.970 --> 02:34:40.704
QUESTIONS MAYBE A COUPLE

02:34:40.771 --> 02:34:42.206
STATEMENTS IN THEIR FIRST WHEN

02:34:42.272 --> 02:34:44.808
YOU TALK ABOUT THE EXISTING BOND --

02:34:44.875 --> 02:34:46.343
THAT BOND MONEY HAS BEEN CLAIMED

02:34:46.410 --> 02:34:47.778
IT HASN'T ALL BEEN DISTRIBUTED

02:34:47.845 --> 02:34:48.979
BECAUSE THE BONTA HAVING ALL

02:34:49.046 --> 02:34:50.214
BEEN FLOATED AT THE STATE LEVEL

02:34:50.280 --> 02:34:51.682
BUT AGAIN THAT MONEY WILL GO

02:34:51.749 --> 02:34:52.916
DOWN TO THE LOCALS ONCE.

02:34:52.983 --> 02:34:54.885
ONCE -- ONCE THOSE BONDS ARE

02:34:54.952 --> 02:34:56.220
SOLD WERE WAITING FOR THE

02:34:56.286 --> 02:34:57.054
GOVERNOR TO ALLOW MORE THOSE

02:34:57.121 --> 02:34:58.288
LAWS WE STILL GET THAT'S FROM

02:34:58.355 --> 02:35:00.391
THE LAST BONTA THAT MONEY HAS

02:35:00.457 --> 02:35:01.692
BEEN ESSENTIALLY CLAIM.

02:35:01.759 --> 02:35:03.327
GOING FORWARD THIS IS A BOMB I

02:35:03.394 --> 02:35:04.428
DON'T EXPECT THIS BOND WILL BE

02:35:04.495 --> 02:35:06.230
ANYWHERE NEAR A HUNDRED BILLION

02:35:06.296 --> 02:35:07.665
DOLLARS I DON'T THINK IT'LL BE

02:35:07.731 --> 02:35:09.133
TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS -- AT

02:35:09.199 --> 02:35:10.434
BEST IT MAYBE TEN BILLION

02:35:10.501 --> 02:35:12.069
DOLLARS WE DON'T KNOW TODAY BUT

02:35:12.136 --> 02:35:14.171
WE I I IMAGINE ALL THE SOMEWHERE

02:35:14.238 --> 02:35:16.073
IN THAT RANGE SO WHERE YOU.

YOU'RE GETTING THE HUNDREDS OF

02:35:16.774 --> 02:35:18.509
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FIGURE I

02:35:18.575 --> 02:35:20.411
DON'T KNOW BUT THAT THAT THAT

02:35:20.477 --> 02:35:21.578
ACTUALLY IS IS AN ACCURATE.

02:35:21.645 --> 02:35:23.180
NOW THE LOCALS MIGHT FLOAT THEIR

02:35:23.247 --> 02:35:24.448
OWN BOND.

02:35:24.515 --> 02:35:26.050
WHICH COULD MATCH THE STATE

02:35:26.116 --> 02:35:27.217
DOLLARS BUT AGAIN THAT WOULD

02:35:27.284 --> 02:35:28.285
EXCEED.

02:35:28.352 --> 02:35:31.088
THE STATE BOND DOLLAR THRESHOLD

02:35:31.155 --> 02:35:33.390
IF YOU.

02:35:33.457 --> 02:35:35.759
ABOUT THE HERE I I DO SEE I DO

02:35:35.826 --> 02:35:38.696
READ THAT THAT IF I MAY TAKE

02:35:38.762 --> 02:35:40.631
SOME TIME ME -- THEN WHAT THAT

02:35:40.698 --> 02:35:45.302
TOO MUCH TIME -- IT SAYS IN

02:35:45.369 --> 02:35:46.203
ADDITION THE STATE HAS A THIRTY

02:35:46.270 --> 02:35:48.205
THREE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS

02:35:48.272 --> 02:35:51.975

02:35:52.042 --> 02:35:52.776
YOUR DEATH.

02:35:52.843 --> 02:35:58.916
AND THE MORE SO -- USTED HIS --

02:35:58.982 --> 02:36:00.350
A NIGHT IN THIS POINT I MAY I I

02:36:00.417 --> 02:36:03.854
THINK THAT SPEAKS -- TO THAT

02:36:03.921 --> 02:36:04.822
POTENTIALLY SPEAKS [inaudible]

02:36:04.888 --> 02:36:06.857
TO THE ENTIRE.

02:36:06.924 --> 02:36:07.991
THE THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF

02:36:08.058 --> 02:36:09.827
OUTSTANDING BONDS THE STATE HAS

02:36:09.893 --> 02:36:11.829
CURRENTLY.

02:36:11.895 --> 02:36:13.430
AND IN A STATE THIS LARGE A

02:36:13.497 --> 02:36:15.065
STATE WITH AS MUCH REVENUE AS WE

02:36:15.132 --> 02:36:16.767
HAVE I WOULD MANAGE THAT I WOULD

02:36:16.834 --> 02:36:18.402
I WOULD IMAGINE THAT FIGURE IS

02:36:18.469 --> 02:36:22.606
PRETTY MANAGEABLE.

02:36:22.673 --> 02:36:24.608
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS OF BILLIONS

02:36:24.675 --> 02:36:26.176
OF DOLLARS THAT THE MINISTER.

02:36:26.243 --> 02:36:27.277
HAS CHUNK OF MONEY A LOT OF

02:36:27.344 --> 02:36:28.879
MONEY NO DOUBT BUT THERE ARE ONE

02:36:28.946 --> 02:36:29.847
THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE

02:36:29.913 --> 02:36:31.482
STATE OF CALIFORNIA TEN THOUSAND

02:36:31.548 --> 02:36:33.016
SCHOOLS. SIX POINT TWO MILLION

02:36:33.083 --> 02:36:34.785
SCHOOL CHILDREN SO IT'S A BIG

02:36:34.852 --> 02:36:36.520
OPERATION AND IT DOES TAKE

02:36:36.587 --> 02:36:38.922
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS -- OKAY HAVE

02:36:38.989 --> 02:36:42.760
YOU -- CONTACTED -- A DIFFERENT

02:36:42.826 --> 02:36:44.762
SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- WHETHER THEY

02:36:44.828 --> 02:36:48.665
COULD TAKE CARE OF ALL.

02:36:48.732 --> 02:36:51.468
ON THE ON DISTRICT -- I'M SORRY

02:36:51.535 --> 02:36:52.469
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION

02:36:52.536 --> 02:36:54.738
I MEAN -- ANY SCHOOL FACILITY --

02:36:54.805 --> 02:36:57.307
UP FUNDS SO NECESSARY BY EACH IS

02:36:57.374 --> 02:36:59.042
A DIFFERENT SCHOOL DISTRICT I

02:36:59.109 --> 02:37:02.713
EAT US MIDDLE SCHOOL HIGH SCHOOL

02:37:02.780 --> 02:37:04.681
UNION NOT LAW.

02:37:04.748 --> 02:37:05.549
COLLEGE DISTRICT.

02:37:05.616 --> 02:37:07.251
THEY MAY HAVE -- DIFFERENT

02:37:07.317 --> 02:37:08.752
SITUATIONS UP IN THE SCHOOL

02:37:08.819 --> 02:37:11.388
DISTRICT MAY NOT NEED TO SUCH A

02:37:11.455 --> 02:37:11.588
BOND.

02:37:11.655 --> 02:37:14.658
OKAY -- WHEN THEY NEED IT THAT

02:37:14.725 --> 02:37:17.027
THEY COULD -- FLOW THROUGH OWN

02:37:17.094 --> 02:37:17.895
BOND.

02:37:17.961 --> 02:37:21.298
AND DETERMINED UP IDA UP OF A

02:37:21.365 --> 02:37:22.766
BORDERS TAXPAYERS OF THAT

02:37:22.833 --> 02:37:29.773
DISTRICT THE RATHER THAN WE

02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:31.875
IMPOSE THEM.

02:37:31.942 --> 02:37:32.643
SO SO IN THIS CASE IF THEY IF

02:37:32.709 --> 02:37:33.577
THEY CHOSE TO FLOAT AROUND BOND

02:37:33.644 --> 02:37:34.378
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THEY COULD

02:37:34.444 --> 02:37:35.379
SEE EACH SEEK A MATCH FROM THE

02:37:35.445 --> 02:37:35.612
STATE.

02:37:35.679 --> 02:37:36.246
DID THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I

02:37:36.313 --> 02:37:37.147
MEAN IF THEY DON'T NEED THE

02:37:37.214 --> 02:37:37.714
MONEY THEY SHOULDN'T FOR THE

02:37:37.781 --> 02:37:39.349
BOND.

02:37:39.416 --> 02:37:43.120
BUT THIS IS THE ISSUE MAY WAIT

02:37:43.187 --> 02:37:43.787
ROB ON MAYBE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND.

02:37:43.854 --> 02:37:44.388
I'D LIKE TO ADD AS WELL THAT

02:37:44.454 --> 02:37:44.988
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE NEED FOR

02:37:45.055 --> 02:37:45.522
COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO FOR

02:37:45.589 --> 02:37:46.557
EXAMPLE OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS

02:37:46.623 --> 02:37:48.458
IT'S THIRTY BILLION THAT GOES UP

02:37:48.525 --> 02:37:49.326
TO ABOUT FORTY BILLION DOLLARS

02:37:49.393 --> 02:37:50.460
OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS.

02:37:50.527 --> 02:37:51.795
WE LOOK AT WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN

02:37:51.862 --> 02:37:53.030

02:37:53.096 --> 02:37:55.165

COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THE STATE

02:38:20.858 --> 02:38:21.959

02:38:22.025 --> 02:38:23.527
BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING ABOUT

02:38:23.594 --> 02:38:24.428
THIRTY TO FORTY BILLION DOLLAR

02:38:24.494 --> 02:38:27.197

03:01:13.295 --> 03:01:14.363
WHEN THEY'RE RELEASED FROM FROM

03:01:14.430 --> 03:01:16.031
PRISON WHAT WE REALIZED A FEW

03:01:16.098 --> 03:01:17.566
YEARS AGO IS THAT IF SOMEBODY'S

03:01:17.633 --> 03:01:20.302
ON PAROLE THEY RECIEVE -- FULL

03:01:20.369 --> 03:01:21.971
SPECTRUM OF SERVICES.

03:01:22.037 --> 03:01:23.772
UNDER THE PAYROLL DEPARTMENT --

03:01:23.839 --> 03:01:25.507
AND UNFORTUNATELY EXONERATES AT

03:01:25.574 --> 03:01:27.676
THAT TIME RECEIVED NONE OF THOSE

03:01:27.743 --> 03:01:29.245
SERVICES SO.

03:01:29.311 --> 03:01:31.113
I WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A OF A OF

03:01:31.180 --> 03:01:32.448
A PROBLEM WITH THE LAW.

03:01:32.514 --> 03:01:34.149
IN SO OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS

03:01:34.216 --> 03:01:35.551
WE'VE TRIED TO PROVIDE SOME

03:01:35.618 --> 03:01:36.885
ADDITIONAL IMMEDIATE SERVICES.

03:01:36.952 --> 03:01:38.921
A TWO EXONERATES ON THIS PAST

03:01:38.988 --> 03:01:40.689
YEAR IT'S OUR NATION CONVENE.

03:01:40.756 --> 03:01:41.957
A MEETING OF EXONERATES FROM ALL

03:01:42.024 --> 03:01:44.059
OVER THE COUNTRY TO TALK ABOUT

03:01:44.126 --> 03:01:45.961
THE POLICIES IN THE NEEDS.

03:01:46.028 --> 03:01:47.863
OF EXONERATES AND WHAT WE COULD

03:01:47.930 --> 03:01:48.864
DO IN CALIFORNIA.

03:01:48.931 --> 03:01:50.132
ON TO LOOK AT BEST PRACTICES

03:01:50.199 --> 03:01:51.667
FROM OTHER STATES -- ONE OF

03:01:51.734 --> 03:01:55.471
WHICH WAS THE CHALLENGE OF FOR

03:01:55.537 --> 03:01:57.306
THOSE FOUR HANDFUL OF A GENEROUS

03:01:57.373 --> 03:01:58.874
TO DO PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION

03:01:58.941 --> 03:02:00.609
ONCE THEY'RE RELEASED -- IT WAS

03:02:00.676 --> 03:02:01.677
SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE IN

03:02:01.744 --> 03:02:03.512
TEXAS HAS BEEN ADOPTED A COUPLE

03:02:03.579 --> 03:02:05.381
OF OTHER STATES -- TO PROVIDE

03:02:05.447 --> 03:02:07.983
SOME OTHER ADDITIONAL -- SERVICE

03:02:08.050 --> 03:02:09.251
THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY MEDIA

03:02:09.318 --> 03:02:10.653
UPON RELEASE BUT IT'S SOMETHING

03:02:10.719 --> 03:02:11.520
SOMEWHERE DOWN THE LINE.

03:02:11.587 --> 03:02:13.222
ON THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF EGGS

03:02:13.289 --> 03:02:14.390
HONOREES TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TAKE

03:02:14.456 --> 03:02:15.958
ADVANTAGE AND GET INTO HIGHER

03:02:16.025 --> 03:02:18.160
EDUCATION -- THE MAJORITY OF

03:02:18.227 --> 03:02:18.761
THESE HONOREES WE DEAL WITH

03:02:18.827 --> 03:02:20.829
ANYWHERE FROM NINE TO OVER

03:02:20.896 --> 03:02:22.765
TWENTY YEARS IN STATE PRISON --

03:02:22.831 --> 03:02:24.233
AND SO THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT

03:02:24.300 --> 03:02:25.301
BEHIND BUT THEY'LL SO OFTEN

03:02:25.367 --> 03:02:26.435
TIMES THEY CATCH UP ON MY DID

03:02:26.502 --> 03:02:28.437
HAVE CONVERSATIONS HONORING LA.

03:02:28.504 --> 03:02:30.706
WHO WENT ON TO HIGHER EDUCATION

03:02:30.773 --> 03:02:31.740
AFTER ABOUT?

03:02:31.807 --> 03:02:33.542
AFTER ABOUT SEVEN YEARS OF BEING

03:02:33.609 --> 03:02:34.777
OUT -- WE JUST HAD A

03:02:34.843 --> 03:02:36.412
CONVERSATION WITH ANOTHER ONE

03:02:36.478 --> 03:02:37.880
WHO'S IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE TODAY

03:02:37.946 --> 03:02:45.187
ON HAS A NEED BASED SCHOLARSHIP

03:02:45.254 --> 03:02:47.956
BUT HAS THE PROBLEM HE WAS ONE

03:02:48.023 --> 03:02:48.957
SIX WAS TESTIFIED THE PROBLEM

03:02:49.024 --> 03:02:49.892
THAT HE CANNOT WORK.

03:02:49.958 --> 03:02:50.926
IF YOU WANT TO MAINTAIN THAT

03:02:50.993 --> 03:02:52.394
SPECIAL SCHOLARSHIP THAT HE HAS

03:02:52.461 --> 03:02:53.729
BUT HE HAS TO WORK.

03:02:53.796 --> 03:02:54.330
THE PACE WAS TRYING TO FIGURE

03:02:54.396 --> 03:02:54.997
THAT OUT.

03:02:55.064 --> 03:02:56.665
THE END OF THE DAY.

03:02:56.732 --> 03:02:57.466
THESE EXONERATES HAVE.

03:02:57.533 --> 03:02:58.334
BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH OUR

03:02:58.400 --> 03:02:58.867
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.

03:02:58.934 --> 03:03:00.169
HAVE ENDED UP IN PRISON FOR

03:03:00.235 --> 03:03:03.372
YEARS AT A TIME BECAUSE OF OUR

03:03:03.439 --> 03:03:04.907
SYSTEM SO THIS IS JUST A WAY TO

03:03:04.973 --> 03:03:06.275
PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL

03:03:06.342 --> 03:03:07.509
OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM DOWN THE

03:03:07.576 --> 03:03:09.445
ROAD. FOR THOSE REASONS OUT FOR

03:03:09.511 --> 03:03:11.847
SUPPORT.

03:03:11.914 --> 03:03:14.383
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES I I

03:03:14.450 --> 03:03:16.485
WANT TO THANK MY EXPERT WITNESS

03:03:16.552 --> 03:03:18.454
FOR COMING AND OUT BUT MOST

03:03:18.520 --> 03:03:19.955
IMPORTANTLY WE HAVE I THINK THAT

03:03:20.022 --> 03:03:20.989
THREE OF THREE HAVE WE HAVE

03:03:21.056 --> 03:03:21.690
THREE BILLS THAT ARE DEALING

03:03:21.757 --> 03:03:23.425
WITH THE ISSUE OF EXONERATES.

03:03:23.492 --> 03:03:24.693
AND THIS ONE IS A EQUALLY

03:03:24.760 --> 03:03:25.594
IMPORTANT THE OTHER ONE DEALS

03:03:25.661 --> 03:03:26.729
WITH HOUSING ONE DEALS WITH

03:03:26.795 --> 03:03:28.330
MENTAL HEALTH.

03:03:28.397 --> 03:03:28.831
AND THIS ONE DEALS WITH

03:03:28.897 --> 03:03:31.133
EDUCATION IT'S A TRAGIC IT'S A

03:03:31.200 --> 03:03:32.935
SMALL POPULATION OF INDIVIDUALS

03:03:33.001 --> 03:03:34.970
ACTUALLY BUT IT'S BUT THE FACT

03:03:35.037 --> 03:03:36.505
THAT WE HAVE INCARCERATED PEOPLE

03:03:36.572 --> 03:03:38.974
UNFAIRLY. FOR TEN TWENTY THIRTY

03:03:39.041 --> 03:03:40.342
YEARS WE'VE DISRUPTED THEIR

03:03:40.409 --> 03:03:41.777
LIVES OFTENTIMES THEIR FAMILIES

03:03:41.844 --> 03:03:43.312
HAVE GONE SOMEWHERE ELSE THE

03:03:43.379 --> 03:03:45.414
WIVES OF ESPOUSES HAVE DIVORCED

03:03:45.481 --> 03:03:47.116
THEM WHATEVER IT IS WAS SO THEY

03:03:47.182 --> 03:03:48.517
COME OUT WITH NOTHING.

03:03:48.584 --> 03:03:49.885
OFTENTIMES WITHOUT THE SUPPORT

03:03:49.952 --> 03:03:51.754
OF FAMILIES AND WITHOUT THE

03:03:51.820 --> 03:03:53.689
OPPORTUNITY TO EVEN FIND FOLKS

03:03:53.756 --> 03:03:55.090
THEY ONCE WORKED FOR A WHATEVER.

03:03:55.157 --> 03:03:56.625
AND SO WE THEN IT NEED TO HAVE A

03:03:56.692 --> 03:03:58.227
RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:03:58.293 --> 03:03:59.962
THEY DON'T GO BACK IN THE

03:04:00.028 --> 03:04:01.597
THEY'LL GO BACK INTO PRISON A

03:04:01.663 --> 03:04:02.231
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ALL THE

03:04:02.297 --> 03:04:03.665
RESOURCES -- AND THEY SHOULD

03:04:03.732 --> 03:04:05.067
HAVE BEEN IN THE FIRST PLACE SO

03:04:05.134 --> 03:04:06.769
THIS IS THE LEAST WE CAN DO I

03:04:06.835 --> 03:04:08.971
THINK TO SAY TO THEM THAT WE WE

03:04:09.037 --> 03:04:09.838
WERE WRONG BECAUSE WE WANT TO

03:04:09.905 --> 03:04:10.939
HELP YOU REBUILD YOUR LIFE.

03:04:11.006 --> 03:04:12.141
AND GOING TO SCHOOL IS ONE OF

03:04:12.207 --> 03:04:13.442
THOSE AS WELL AS THE MENTAL

03:04:13.509 --> 03:04:14.376
HEALTH ISSUES THAT WOULD DEAL

03:04:14.443 --> 03:04:16.145
WITH AS WELL AS HOUSING SO I

03:04:16.211 --> 03:04:21.450
RESPECTFULLY ASK THE I. BUT WE

03:04:21.517 --> 03:04:26.488
GET A QUORUM.

03:04:26.555 --> 03:04:28.390

ON THAT THE POINTS YOU MENTIONED

03:15:51.606 --> 03:15:52.874
SO -- AS FAR AS KIND OF WHAT IS

03:15:52.941 --> 03:15:55.510
THE RIGHT STAGE TO GET TO AS

03:15:55.577 --> 03:15:57.178
YOUNG PEOPLE IN STUDENTS ENGAGE

03:15:57.245 --> 03:15:59.047
IN OUR DEMOCRACY.

03:15:59.114 --> 03:16:00.648
I THINK YOU'RE YOUR IDEAS OF

03:16:00.715 --> 03:16:01.549
MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE DOING

03:16:01.616 --> 03:16:03.118
THAT AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE IS

03:16:03.184 --> 03:16:05.320
GREAT -- IN IF IF WE CAN START

03:16:05.386 --> 03:16:06.588
TALKING TO PEOPLE ABOUT BEING

03:16:06.654 --> 03:16:08.523
ACTIVE CITIZENS AND WHAT IT

03:16:08.590 --> 03:16:10.325
MEANS TO BE A VOTER WHEN THEY'RE

03:16:10.391 --> 03:16:12.627
IN HIGH SCHOOL THAT'S TERRIFIC.

03:16:12.694 --> 03:16:13.795
I THINK I'M.

03:16:13.862 --> 03:16:14.996
MOST STUDENTS TURNING EITHER

03:16:15.063 --> 03:16:16.798
TURN EIGHTEEN RIGHT BEFORE THEY

03:16:16.865 --> 03:16:18.032
GO TO COLLEGE OR WHILE THEY'RE

03:16:18.099 --> 03:16:18.700
IN COLLEGE.

03:16:18.766 --> 03:16:19.367
SERVER FOR MOST STUDENTS THEY'RE

03:16:19.434 --> 03:16:21.636
IN COLLEGE THE VERY FIRST TIME

03:16:21.703 --> 03:16:22.937
THAT THEY VOTE.

03:16:23.004 --> 03:16:25.773
AND I THINK THAT WHAT WE'VE SEEN

03:16:25.840 --> 03:16:27.175
FOR OUR PARTICIPANTS IN OUR

03:16:27.242 --> 03:16:29.544
DEMOCRACY IT AT THE COLLEGE AGE

03:16:29.611 --> 03:16:30.912
AND AND YOUNG ADULTS.

03:16:30.979 --> 03:16:33.615
IS THAT WE WE HAVE VERY LOW

03:16:33.681 --> 03:16:36.117
LEVELS AS VOTER PARTICIPATION

03:16:36.184 --> 03:16:37.485
VERY LOW LOW LEVELS OF

03:16:37.552 --> 03:16:39.187
PARTICIPATION IN OUR IN OUR

03:16:39.254 --> 03:16:40.822
CIVIC LIFE AND SO I THINK IT'S

03:16:40.889 --> 03:16:42.957
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US. TO

03:16:43.024 --> 03:16:44.359
THINK ABOUT EDUCATION NOT JUST

03:16:44.425 --> 03:16:45.627
AS SOMETHING THAT THAT ENDS

03:16:45.693 --> 03:16:46.694
WITHIN THE CONFINES OF A

03:16:46.761 --> 03:16:48.563
CLASSROOM BUT EXPANDING BEYOND

03:16:48.630 --> 03:16:49.564
THE BOUNDARIES.

03:16:49.631 --> 03:16:51.232
AND INCLUDING YOU KNOW WHAT IT

03:16:51.299 --> 03:16:52.534
MEANS TO BE A CITIZEN WHAT IT

03:16:52.600 --> 03:16:54.469
MEANS TO BE PART OF OF OUR

03:16:54.536 --> 03:16:55.537
DEMOCRACY I THINK THAT WILL ONLY

03:16:55.603 --> 03:16:56.070
MAKE.

03:16:56.137 --> 03:16:58.773

03:40:47.901 --> 03:40:51.671
MY CONCERN NOT WHEN THIS ONE IS

03:40:51.738 --> 03:40:53.506
SO WHEN YOU COLLECT -- KNOWN TO

03:40:53.573 --> 03:40:58.078
OUR TO A DINNER IS DATA -- OF

03:40:58.144 --> 03:41:02.349
EACH IS JUNE ON THE IS THERE ANY --

03:41:02.415 --> 03:41:04.150
WAY YOU CAN PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY

03:41:04.217 --> 03:41:06.219
ONCE THAT THE DATA.

03:41:06.286 --> 03:41:09.222
IS COLLECTED THE US SO VAST

03:41:09.289 --> 03:41:11.958
AMOUNT OF LAW.

03:41:12.025 --> 03:41:14.828
A DATA ONE H. SHOULD -- THAT

03:41:14.894 --> 03:41:15.795
WELL THAT'S ONE OF OUR BIGGEST

03:41:15.862 --> 03:41:16.896
CONCERNS IS MAKING SURE THAT THE

03:41:16.963 --> 03:41:18.531
DATA WOULD BE PROPERLY --

03:41:18.598 --> 03:41:20.066
PROTECTED AND AND YOU KNOW THAT

03:41:20.133 --> 03:41:22.702
WOULD BE LOOKING AT ENCRYPTION

03:41:22.769 --> 03:41:24.437
OR ANONYMIZING.

03:41:24.504 --> 03:41:25.305
DATA.

03:41:25.372 --> 03:41:27.107
SO -- WE HAD THERE'S ANOTHER

03:41:27.173 --> 03:41:28.274
BILL IN THE SENATE THAT'S

03:41:28.341 --> 03:41:29.976
WORKING ON THIS ISSUE TO AND AND

03:41:30.043 --> 03:41:30.810
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE

03:41:30.877 --> 03:41:32.812
GOVERNOR SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

03:41:32.879 --> 03:41:36.149
THAT WE HAD ASSEMBLY VEHICLE AND

03:41:36.216 --> 03:41:38.084
ONE OF OUR BIGGEST ISSUES IS.

03:41:38.151 --> 03:41:40.053
A DEFINING HOW -- TO PROTECT

03:41:40.120 --> 03:41:44.424
THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION.

03:41:44.491 --> 03:41:45.892
SO WHO'S GONNA MANAGER OR OF THE

03:41:45.959 --> 03:41:46.459
STATE.

03:41:46.526 --> 03:41:48.695
OF WE HAVE NOTS WE WE GET OTHER

03:41:48.762 --> 03:41:49.929
SOME TALK ABOUT WHAT THE

03:41:49.996 --> 03:41:51.297
GOVERNING BODY YOU KNOW BEEN IN

03:41:51.364 --> 03:41:53.299
THE PREVIOUS ITERATIONS WHAT THE

03:41:53.366 --> 03:41:54.934
GOVERNING BODY WOULD BE BUT

03:41:55.001 --> 03:41:57.704
WE'VE LEFT -- THAT ISSUE OF YEAH

03:41:57.771 --> 03:41:59.873
I WOULD JUST ADD THAT THAT'S

03:41:59.939 --> 03:42:00.407
HERE THESE ARE ON CHARTER

03:42:00.473 --> 03:42:02.008
TERRITORIES FOR CALIFORNIA BUT

03:42:02.075 --> 03:42:02.742
THAT'S WHY.

03:42:02.809 --> 03:42:05.679
I'M THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A TASK

03:42:05.745 --> 03:42:06.713
FORCE AS THIS BILL DOES IS

03:42:06.780 --> 03:42:08.348
CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT WE GET

03:42:08.415 --> 03:42:09.816
THE SYSTEM RIGHT AND AND ONE

03:42:09.883 --> 03:42:11.451
OTHER CHARGES IS TO KIND OF COME

03:42:11.518 --> 03:42:12.419
BACK WITH.

03:42:12.485 --> 03:42:13.620
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ON

03:42:13.687 --> 03:42:15.488
GOVERNANCE AND HOW WE PROTECT

03:42:23.096 --> 03:42:23.329
[inaudible]

03:42:23.396 --> 03:42:25.799
IMPLEMENTED SYSTEM.

03:42:25.865 --> 03:42:27.133
THIS IS THE AYE AYE IT'S IN THE

03:42:27.200 --> 03:42:29.302
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THERE IS --

03:42:29.369 --> 03:42:30.904
MONEY I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH BUT

03:42:30.970 --> 03:42:32.005
THE WE'RE WE'RE REALLY TODAY

03:42:32.072 --> 03:42:34.207
JUST TALKING ABOUT THE THE

03:42:34.274 --> 03:42:36.376
POLICY OF MAKING SURE THAT WE

03:42:36.443 --> 03:42:39.546
ARE ABLE -- TO TRACK STUDENT UP

03:42:39.612 --> 03:42:42.248
PROGRESS LIKE I MENTIONED BEFORE

03:42:42.315 --> 03:42:44.350
MANY STATES -- HAVE THIS IN

03:42:44.417 --> 03:42:45.685
PLACE ALREADY AT ALL AND I THINK

03:42:45.752 --> 03:42:47.854
IT'S CRITICAL THAT CALIFORNIA --

03:42:47.921 --> 03:42:49.956
FOLLOW SUIT SO YOU CAN LOOK AT

03:42:50.023 --> 03:42:53.059
WHAT OUR OUR GOOD PRACTICES SO

03:42:53.126 --> 03:42:55.161
FOR INSTANCE IF YOU HAVE.

03:42:55.228 --> 03:43:00.200
THOSE BEEN A LOT OF THE LC FF IT

03:43:00.266 --> 03:43:01.668
IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE.

03:43:01.735 --> 03:43:04.504
BEEN -- THE THE THE MOORED.

03:43:04.571 --> 03:43:05.805
DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS AND YOU

03:43:05.872 --> 03:43:07.073
WANT TO SEE HOW IS THAT MONEY

03:43:07.140 --> 03:43:08.675
BEING SPENT AND AND ARE YOU

03:43:08.742 --> 03:43:10.043
GETTING BETTER OUTCOMES AND THIS

03:43:10.110 --> 03:43:12.579
IS EXACTLY ONE OF THE THINGS

03:43:12.645 --> 03:43:15.081
THAT YOU COULD -- BE TRACKING

03:43:15.148 --> 03:43:16.983
RIGHT NOW IN SOME WAYS -- WE

03:43:17.050 --> 03:43:19.352
DON'T HAVE A GOOD WAY -- TO

03:43:19.419 --> 03:43:20.520
TRACK THOSE THINGS ARE GONNA

03:43:20.587 --> 03:43:22.088
TAKE UP TOO MUCH TIME BUT THE

03:43:22.155 --> 03:43:23.990
CAN YOU GIVE US SOME IN A

03:43:24.057 --> 03:43:25.759
SITUATION WHAT KIND OF A DATA --

03:43:25.825 --> 03:43:28.328
SPECIFIC INFORMATION WILL BE

03:43:28.394 --> 03:43:31.064
CRITICAL. FOR THIS SYSTEM TO BE

03:43:31.131 --> 03:43:33.733
DEVELOPED.

03:43:33.800 --> 03:43:35.969
HOW THAT'LL HELP?

03:43:36.035 --> 03:43:39.038
YOU COULD BE LOOKING AT OF

03:43:39.105 --> 03:43:41.975
HEALTH BEHAVIORS IN KINDERGARTEN

03:43:42.041 --> 03:43:44.811
AND GRADES IN KINDERGARTEN --

03:43:44.878 --> 03:43:47.447
THE HOW HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE IN

03:43:47.514 --> 03:43:49.182
A CLASS YOU COULD BE.

03:43:49.249 --> 03:43:51.084
LOOKING AT OUT CUT HOW MANY

03:43:51.151 --> 03:43:53.319
STUDENTS ARE DROPPING OUT HOW

03:43:53.386 --> 03:43:54.854
MANY STUDENTS ARE GRADUATING

03:43:54.921 --> 03:43:56.589
FROM CERTAIN HIGH SCHOOL GOING

03:43:56.656 --> 03:43:59.092
DIRECTLY INTO COMMUNITY COLLEGE

03:43:59.159 --> 03:44:00.527
HOW MANY ARE GOING ON CAREER

03:44:00.593 --> 03:44:02.862
PATHWAYS YOU KNOW STARTING EARLY

03:44:02.929 --> 03:44:05.698
ON IF YOU STARTED WITH THE

03:44:05.765 --> 03:44:06.966
CAREER PATHWAY LIKE OF THEIRS.

03:44:07.033 --> 03:44:08.234
HAPPENING A LOT OF THE HIGH

03:44:08.301 --> 03:44:10.436
SCHOOLS RIGHT NOW -- HOW MANY

03:44:10.503 --> 03:44:12.038
STUDENTS MAINTAIN THAT CAREER

03:44:12.105 --> 03:44:13.540
PATHWAY WHERE IS IT THAT YOU CAN

03:44:13.606 --> 03:44:15.475
BEST SPEND RESOURCES TO IMPROVE

03:44:15.542 --> 03:44:17.043
STUDENT OUTCOMES?

03:44:17.110 --> 03:44:19.679
YOU PROBABLY HAVE SOME SPECIALS.

03:44:19.746 --> 03:44:20.513
I'M SORRY YOU OUT YOU ARE

03:44:20.580 --> 03:44:26.186
TALKING ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT

03:44:26.252 --> 03:44:27.687
INDIVIDUALS DATE ARE.

03:44:27.754 --> 03:44:29.923
FROM MY KINDERGARTEN.

03:44:29.989 --> 03:44:31.724
THAT MEANT THREE ALL THE WAY

03:44:31.791 --> 03:44:33.493
MIGHT BEHAVE YES MY GREYS SO

03:44:33.560 --> 03:44:34.961
WHERE I LIVED OUT.

03:44:35.028 --> 03:44:37.230
AND THEN ALSO -- BECAUSE EACH

03:44:37.297 --> 03:44:40.733
SCHOOL STATISTICS.

03:44:40.800 --> 03:44:41.568
I THINK WHAT WE'RE REALLY

03:44:41.634 --> 03:44:42.735
LOOKING TO TO DO IS MAKE SURE A

03:44:42.802 --> 03:44:43.336
LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM WOULD

03:44:43.403 --> 03:44:45.572
INTER CONNECTED A SYSTEMS FROM.

03:44:45.638 --> 03:44:46.940
EARLY CHILDHOOD READ THROUGH K.

03:44:47.006 --> 03:44:48.074
THROUGH TWELVE THROUGH POST

03:44:48.141 --> 03:44:50.476
SECONDARY THROUGH THE WORK FORCE

03:44:50.543 --> 03:44:52.779
INDIVIDUAL.

03:44:52.846 --> 03:44:54.681
MORE COMPLETE PICTURE OF A

03:44:54.747 --> 03:44:57.350
STUDENT'S TRAJECTORY THROUGH OUR

03:44:57.417 --> 03:44:59.619
EDUCATION HIGHER EDUCATION

03:44:59.686 --> 03:45:01.387
SYSTEMS AND FOR TO WORK FOR SO

03:45:01.454 --> 03:45:03.590
WE CAN UNDERSTAND HOLD IT BE

03:45:03.656 --> 03:45:08.194
USED BY THE EMPLOYERS.

03:45:08.261 --> 03:45:10.763
BEFORE WHEN I HI YOU YOU --

03:45:10.830 --> 03:45:11.798
WOODEN.

03:45:11.865 --> 03:45:12.899
ACCESS TO THAT DATA AND THEN

03:45:12.966 --> 03:45:14.634
ANALYZE SO HOW YOU GREW UP OF

03:45:14.701 --> 03:45:15.902
LOOKING OF OF ACADEMIC

03:45:15.969 --> 03:45:18.104
ACHIEVEMENT -- WITH YOUR TEACHER

03:45:18.171 --> 03:45:19.172
TALKED ABOUT YOU.

03:45:19.239 --> 03:45:20.707
I I DON'T NECESSARILY SEE THAT

03:45:20.773 --> 03:45:21.741
IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD

03:45:21.808 --> 03:45:23.676
BE USED BY EMPLOYERS THIS IS

03:45:23.743 --> 03:45:24.611
REALLY MORE ART.

03:45:24.677 --> 03:45:25.612
GET MAKING SURE THAT THE

03:45:25.678 --> 03:45:27.714
EDUCATION SYSTEM IS PERFORMING

03:45:27.780 --> 03:45:29.449
THE WAY THAT IT SHOULD BUT ALL

03:45:29.515 --> 03:45:31.150
OF THAT STILL HAS TO BE DEFINED

03:45:31.217 --> 03:45:33.152
THIS IS REALLY THE THE CONCEPT

03:45:33.219 --> 03:45:35.922
OF OF MAKING SURE THAT THAT DATA

03:45:35.989 --> 03:45:39.726
IS AVAILABLE.

03:45:39.792 --> 03:45:41.060
TO LOOK AT THE YOU KNOW.

03:45:41.127 --> 03:45:42.061
MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE PUTTING

03:45:42.128 --> 03:45:43.196
THE CORRECT -- CORRECT POLICIES

03:45:43.263 --> 03:45:44.898
IN PLACE AND PUTTING BACK

03:45:44.964 --> 03:45:45.698
RESOURCES IN THE CORRECT PLACES

03:45:45.765 --> 03:45:46.900
ALL I DON'T KNOW YOU ARE SAYING

03:45:46.966 --> 03:45:48.935
MORE DATA SPEED UP BUT I'M VERY

03:45:49.002 --> 03:45:50.403
WE WE KNOW WHEN.

03:45:50.470 --> 03:45:51.905
FIRST ORDER.

03:45:51.971 --> 03:45:53.806
INFORMATION IS.

03:45:53.873 --> 03:45:55.642
IS OF BROUGHT TO LIFE IS

03:45:55.708 --> 03:45:58.378
ACCUMULATED AND OF HOW THAT ARE

03:45:58.444 --> 03:46:03.616
THE USED TO BUY HOME IN A AND

03:46:03.683 --> 03:46:04.250
THOSE THINGS HAVE TO BE DEFINED

03:46:04.317 --> 03:46:04.851
STILL CERTAINLY WE ALL HAVE

03:46:04.918 --> 03:46:06.085
CONCERN ABOUT OUR PERSONAL

03:46:06.152 --> 03:46:09.155
INFORMATION IS USED AND AND AND

03:46:09.222 --> 03:46:11.524
THE THE WE JUST HAD THE PRIVACY

03:46:11.591 --> 03:46:13.459
INITIATIVE PASSED WHICH PUTS.

03:46:13.526 --> 03:46:14.928
A LOT OF RESTRICTIONS IN PLACE I

03:46:14.994 --> 03:46:16.763
THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT WE

03:46:16.829 --> 03:46:18.031
NEED TO PROTECT THAT DATA WE

03:46:18.097 --> 03:46:19.632
NEED TO HAVE AN ENCRYPTED WE

03:46:19.699 --> 03:46:21.901
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT.

03:46:21.968 --> 03:46:24.804
THAT -- THAT THAT INFORMATION IS

03:46:24.871 --> 03:46:25.939
PROTECTED BUT THAT'S YOU KNOW

03:46:26.005 --> 03:46:27.674
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT YOU DON'T

03:46:27.740 --> 03:46:29.309
USE DATA FOR GOOD THERE IS THERE

03:46:29.375 --> 03:46:30.043
IS.

03:46:30.109 --> 03:46:33.112
USING BIG DATA CAN HELP WITH

03:46:33.179 --> 03:46:36.549
RESEARCH IT CAN HELP -- CHANGE

03:46:36.616 --> 03:46:39.185
OUTCOME SO OF YOU KNOW WHAT WE

03:46:39.252 --> 03:46:41.154
WE HAVE THIS INFORMATION IN A

03:46:41.220 --> 03:46:43.122
LOT OF DIFFERENT PLACES THIS IS

03:46:43.189 --> 03:46:45.258

FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND RECIPIENTS --

03:51:31.410 --> 03:51:33.145

THEIR FAMILY TO ATTEND COLLEGE

03:51:36.048 --> 03:51:37.483
SO FIRST AND FOREMOST WE JUST

03:51:37.550 --> 03:51:38.751
WANT TO INSURE THAT.

03:51:38.818 --> 03:51:39.986

AND IN THE WAKE OF THE SCANDAL

03:51:52.398 --> 03:51:53.633
WHICH I THINK WAS SHOCKING TO IN

03:51:53.699 --> 03:51:54.800
ALL OF OUR INSTITUTIONS THEY

03:51:54.867 --> 03:51:55.735
HAVE BEEN TAKING THIS

03:51:55.801 --> 03:51:57.103
OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW.

PROCEDURES AND PROTOCOLS.

03:52:03.142 --> 03:52:04.076
AND OUR INSTITUTIONS DON'T HAVE

03:52:04.143 --> 03:52:06.412

BEING EVALUATED UNDER THE SAME

03:55:36.622 --> 03:55:39.492

03:55:42.228 --> 03:55:43.562

REVOLUTIONARY STEP.

04:08:42.941 --> 04:08:44.676
I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE IF

04:08:44.743 --> 04:08:46.878

UPON WHAT.

04:09:01.493 --> 04:09:02.027
WELL THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF

04:09:02.093 --> 04:09:03.528
CHICAGO AND THOUSAND COLLEGES

04:09:03.595 --> 04:09:05.263
ARE ALREADY DOING THIS.

04:09:05.330 --> 04:09:06.898
AND WHAT WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND

04:09:06.965 --> 04:09:08.099
ALSO.

04:09:08.166 --> 04:09:10.735
A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY EVERY SAID

04:09:10.802 --> 04:09:11.269
TEXAS THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE

04:09:11.336 --> 04:09:15.807
LOOKING AT TEST SCORES -- NOT TO

NOT TEST SCORES I'D GPA AND YOUR

04:09:17.542 --> 04:09:19.010
CLASS RANK BECAUSE THERE'S

04:09:19.077 --> 04:09:20.245
RESEARCH IS THOSE THAT YOUR

04:09:20.312 --> 04:09:22.614
SUCCESS AMONG YOUR PEERS.

04:09:22.681 --> 04:09:24.482

OF YEAR SUCCESS IN COLLEGE THEN

04:09:27.519 --> 04:09:28.987
YOU'RE YOU'RE AT SCORES ON THE

04:09:29.054 --> 04:09:32.757
SAT ACT BUT THE BIGGER QUESTION

04:09:32.824 --> 04:09:33.725
DOCTOR CHOI IS THAT.

04:09:33.792 --> 04:09:36.061
WE'RE ASKING THE UC AND CSU. TO

04:09:36.127 --> 04:09:38.129
STUDY THIS AND A POTENTIAL PHASE

04:09:38.196 --> 04:09:39.764
OUT THEY MAY COME BACK AND SAY

04:09:39.831 --> 04:09:40.932
YOU KNOW WHAT.

04:09:40.999 --> 04:09:43.034
WE ARE FINE WITH THE S. A. T.

04:09:43.101 --> 04:09:44.602
WE'D LIKE TO KEEP IT AS FRANKLY

04:09:44.669 --> 04:09:47.539
WITH THE UC SYSTEM A BIG PART OF

04:09:47.605 --> 04:09:48.173
BY A PIE Y. WORKS FOR THEM IS

04:09:48.239 --> 04:09:49.240
JUST.

04:09:49.307 --> 04:09:51.543
THE THE THE THE RAW NUMBER OF

04:09:51.609 --> 04:09:53.111
APPLICATIONS YOU KNOW.

04:09:53.178 --> 04:09:53.878
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

04:09:53.945 --> 04:09:55.480
APPLICATIONS IT IS EASY TO SORT

04:09:55.547 --> 04:09:56.281
THEM.

04:09:56.348 --> 04:09:58.383
BY -- BY TEST SCORE THROUGH

04:09:58.450 --> 04:10:01.219
THROUGH THE SAT SO AGAIN THE

04:10:01.286 --> 04:10:02.787
UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA -- AND THE

04:10:02.854 --> 04:10:05.023
CSU SYSTEM ARE GOING.

04:10:05.090 --> 04:10:06.925
TO STUDY THIS AND REPORT BACK TO

04:10:06.991 --> 04:10:09.260
US SO IT'S NOT A GUARANTEED THAT

04:10:09.327 --> 04:10:10.228
THIS WOULD HAPPEN IT'S AN

04:10:10.295 --> 04:10:12.030
OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO EVALUATE

04:10:12.097 --> 04:10:13.732
THE EFFECTIVENESS.

04:10:13.798 --> 04:10:15.233
OF THIS AND WHETHER OR NOT IT

04:10:15.300 --> 04:10:19.938
SHOULD BE UTILIZED GOING FORWARD.

04:10:20.004 --> 04:10:22.974
I UNDERSTAND BUT THAT THIS IS SO.

04:10:23.041 --> 04:10:25.043
I I THINK FOR YOUR GENESIS OF

04:10:25.110 --> 04:10:26.244
THIS OUT RESOLUTION IS A YOU

04:10:26.311 --> 04:10:28.413

04:10:28.480 --> 04:10:31.049
NECESSITY AND THE A. C. T..

04:10:31.116 --> 04:10:33.118
SO MUCH WE BEGIN THIS A

04:10:33.184 --> 04:10:35.620
QUESTIONING -- RANKING STUDENTS

04:10:35.687 --> 04:10:37.989
ACADEMIC ABILITIES SELF UP BASED

04:10:38.056 --> 04:10:39.224
UPON THIS KIND BUT TOURISTS ARE

04:10:39.290 --> 04:10:42.327

ANY TYPE OF A QUESTION ARE.

04:10:46.898 --> 04:10:52.704
AT THE VERY IT AT ALL LEVELS OF

04:10:52.771 --> 04:10:54.506
A SCHOOL OR SO.

04:10:54.572 --> 04:10:55.840

TEST A HOW CAN YOU WRITE THOSE

04:10:57.809 --> 04:10:58.443
CHILDREN.

WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT THE

04:11:00.044 --> 04:11:02.680
RANKS -- GPAS CAN BE USED ABOUT

04:11:02.747 --> 04:11:06.651
THE LATER MORE LIBERAL SOUGHT

04:11:06.718 --> 04:11:07.485
CAN BE YOU DON'T WANT THAT WE

04:11:07.552 --> 04:11:08.653
ARE ALL CREATED EQUAL HOW CAN

SUCH A SO A I I THINK THIS IS SO

04:11:14.259 --> 04:11:15.894
CREATING.

04:11:15.960 --> 04:11:18.763
OUR SOMETHING ON NECESSARY -- IN

04:11:18.830 --> 04:11:21.299
A CAN WARM AND THEN IT MAY

04:11:21.366 --> 04:11:22.667
JEOPARDIZE.

04:11:22.734 --> 04:11:26.037
OUR FUTURE -- INTELLECTUAL ôNG.

04:11:26.104 --> 04:11:27.906
ã DICK -- COMPETITIVENESS OUT

04:11:27.972 --> 04:11:29.507
OF A WILL FIND SCORES SO THAT

04:11:29.574 --> 04:11:31.009

04:11:31.075 --> 04:11:37.582
THROUGH YOU SEE -- CAST A SYSTEM.

04:11:41.453 --> 04:11:42.253
REPEAT.

04:11:42.320 --> 04:11:45.457
THAT THIS BILL I THINK IS ASKING

04:11:45.523 --> 04:11:48.193
FOR UC AND CSU TO DO A STUDY OF

04:11:48.259 --> 04:11:50.228
WE HAVE NOT.

04:11:50.295 --> 04:11:51.830
BUT THEY HAVE NOT DONE THE STUDY

04:11:51.896 --> 04:11:52.797
SO THERE.

04:11:52.864 --> 04:11:54.098
YOU KNOW THE DETERMINATION OF

04:11:54.165 --> 04:11:56.234
WHAT THEY FIND AND THE IN THIS

04:11:56.301 --> 04:11:57.702
STUDY IS TO BE DETERMINED.

04:11:57.769 --> 04:11:59.804
AND I THINK THAT IS THE THE

04:11:59.871 --> 04:12:03.141
INTENT OF THIS RESOLUTION --

04:12:03.208 --> 04:12:03.775

YEAH I I THINK THERE ARE THIS

04:12:06.744 --> 04:12:09.380
WHOLE COLLEGE SCANDAL RAISES A

04:12:09.447 --> 04:12:11.416
QUESTION NOT JUST PEOPLE --

04:12:11.483 --> 04:12:13.718
ILLEGALLY MESSING AROUND THE SAT

04:12:13.785 --> 04:12:15.687

SUCCESS OF A OF A HIGH SCHOOL

04:12:27.365 --> 04:12:28.433
STUDENT AND INTEL.

04:12:28.500 --> 04:12:29.734
THERE ARE MANY POINTS OF

04:12:29.801 --> 04:12:31.336
RESEARCH THAT THAT POINT TO THE

04:12:31.402 --> 04:12:32.103
NEGATIVE THERE.

04:12:32.170 --> 04:12:33.638
AND SO THIS IS GOING ALLOW THAT

04:12:33.705 --> 04:12:35.907
ALLOW US TO TAKE A DEEPER DIVE

04:12:35.974 --> 04:12:37.542
WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD LOOK AT

04:12:37.609 --> 04:12:39.277
WHAT A THOUSAND SCHOOLS ARE

04:12:39.344 --> 04:12:40.812
