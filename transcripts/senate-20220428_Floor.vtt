00:19:10.215 --> 00:19:13.218
AND TWENTY TWENTY THERE ARE

00:19:13.285 --> 00:19:14.386
THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIA

00:19:14.453 --> 00:19:16.555
RESIDENTS IN THEIR QUEUE. AND

00:19:16.622 --> 00:19:18.223
THE WAIT TIME IS ALSO INCREASED

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:20.425
SO IT SOME FOLKS ARE WAITING UP

00:19:20.492 --> 00:19:22.327
TO A DECADE TO GET THEIR

00:19:22.394 --> 00:19:24.029
CITIZENSHIP APPLICATION FULLY

00:19:24.096 --> 00:19:27.633
PROCESSED IN GRANTED. SO I FEEL

00:19:27.699 --> 00:19:29.701
THAT GIVEN THAT WE ALLOW THIS

00:19:29.768 --> 00:19:31.937
SAME CATEGORY PEOPLE TO SERVE IN

00:19:32.004 --> 00:19:33.305
THE MILITARY TO SERVE AND SO

00:19:33.372 --> 00:19:34.840
MANY OTHER PROFESSIONS THAT

00:19:34.907 --> 00:19:36.408
THERE'S NO REASON TO DENY A

00:19:36.475 --> 00:19:38.443
PERSON WHO IS OTHERWISE LEGALLY

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.913

AS A PEACE OFFICER. ON AND WITH

00:19:44.082 --> 00:19:46.318
THAT BY APPLE LET ME MAKE IT

00:19:46.385 --> 00:19:48.687
CLEAR THAT IT STILL REQUIRES ALL

00:19:48.754 --> 00:19:50.556
OTHER RIGOROUS STANDARDS THAT WE

00:19:50.622 --> 00:19:53.025

FULL BACKGROUND IN CRIMINAL

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:00.265
HISTORY CHECKS AND OF COURSE THE

00:20:00.332 --> 00:20:01.533
FACT THAT YOU HAVE A LEGAL WORK

FICTION. THROUGHOUT THIS NATION

00:21:52.177 --> 00:21:55.080
OF CONDEMNING THOSE LAW

00:21:55.147 --> 00:21:57.883
ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS.

00:21:57.949 --> 00:22:00.719
SPENDING THEIR FACED. THIS

00:22:00.786 --> 00:22:03.088
LEGISLATORS VOTED ON LEGISLATION

00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:05.223
TO DO THAT VERY THING.

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:07.826
LEGISLATION THAT IS PUT NAMES ON

00:22:07.893 --> 00:22:09.661
THAT PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL

00:22:09.728 --> 00:22:12.531
ACROSS THE STREET. SO IT'S A

00:22:12.597 --> 00:22:15.133
LITTLE DIFFICULT NOW. AND INDEED

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.069
ALL OF THE PEACE OFFICER

A GOOD CANDIDATES. IN THIS

00:22:30.615 --> 00:22:32.084
PARTICULAR CASE THOUGH WE'RE

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:33.885
DEALING WITH THE CLASS OF

00:22:33.952 --> 00:22:37.723
INDIVIDUALS. WHO ARE CUSTODIANS

00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:40.058

NOT EVEN CITIZENS. INDIVIDUALS

00:22:51.136 --> 00:22:52.838
WHO WE HAVE NO ABILITY TO

00:22:52.904 --> 00:22:54.639
CONFIRM THEIR CRIMINAL HISTORIES

00:22:54.706 --> 00:22:56.541
IF THEY HAD ANY AND- WHEREVER

00:22:56.608 --> 00:22:59.778
THEY CAME FROM. ABOUT THEIR

00:22:59.845 --> 00:23:02.481
HEALTH CONDITIONS OR ANYTHING.

00:23:02.547 --> 00:23:05.751
THOSE ARE IMPORTANT IMPERATIVES

00:23:05.817 --> 00:23:08.954
THE BE ASSURED UP. SO I WOULDN'T

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:11.256
ALLOW THAT THE SENATE SHOULD

00:23:11.323 --> 00:23:13.358
LACKS QUESTIONS ON THIS

00:23:13.425 --> 00:23:17.362
LEGISLATION AND I URGE A NO VOTE

00:23:17.429 --> 00:23:22.768
. CENTER ARCHULETA. THANK YOU

00:23:22.834 --> 00:23:26.171
MADAM CHAIR I RISE IN SUPPORT.

00:23:26.238 --> 00:23:28.807
AS A FORMER LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:23:28.874 --> 00:23:31.276
OFFICER I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE

00:23:31.343 --> 00:23:33.445
FEEL OUR RANKS WITH DIVERSITY IN

00:23:33.512 --> 00:23:36.014
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE WERE

00:23:36.081 --> 00:23:36.815
VERY PROUD OF. BUT TO HAVE

00:23:36.882 --> 00:23:39.851
SOMEONE BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT

00:23:39.918 --> 00:23:43.722
FULFILLED A STATUS BUT YET S. AS

00:23:43.789 --> 00:23:46.024
A MILITARY VETERAN I'VE HAD THE

00:23:46.091 --> 00:23:48.360
HONOR TO SERVE SIDE BY SIDE WITH

00:23:48.426 --> 00:23:51.229
SOMEONE WHO VERY FAMOUSLY AND

00:23:51.296 --> 00:23:53.431
PROUDLY DISPLAYED A GREEN CARD.

00:23:53.498 --> 00:23:55.066
BUT HE WAS ON A PATH TO

00:23:55.133 --> 00:23:56.601
CITIZENSHIP AND HE KNEW THAT

00:23:56.668 --> 00:23:58.737
BEFORE HE WOULD SHIP HOME HE

00:23:58.804 --> 00:24:00.505
WOULD FULFILL THAT AND BECOME AN

00:24:00.572 --> 00:24:02.440
AMERICAN CITIZEN WELL I SEE THE

00:24:02.507 --> 00:24:04.376
SAME THING AND LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:24:04.442 --> 00:24:06.812
AND BUT TALK ABOUT DIVERSITY I

00:24:06.878 --> 00:24:08.513
REMEMBER BEING ON DUTY AND WE

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:10.081
WOULD GO SOMEWHERE AND WE DIDN'T

00:24:10.148 --> 00:24:11.616
HAVE ANYONE THAT WOULD SPEAK

00:24:11.683 --> 00:24:14.820
CHINESE LANGUAGE. OR SOMEONE WHO

00:24:14.886 --> 00:24:16.788
KNEW ABOUT THE KNOWLEDGE AND

00:24:16.855 --> 00:24:19.491
SKILL ABOUT OTHER CULTURES AND

00:24:19.558 --> 00:24:21.493
SO ON SO IMAGINE HOW THIS IS

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.228
GOING TO OPEN UP THE DOORS YOU

00:24:23.295 --> 00:24:25.697
HAVE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO SERVE

00:24:25.764 --> 00:24:26.565
THIS GREAT COUNTRY WHO WANT TO

00:24:26.631 --> 00:24:28.500
SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES AND ARE

00:24:28.567 --> 00:24:30.769
ON A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP THIS

00:24:30.836 --> 00:24:32.270
IS THE DIFFERENCE AND BECAUSE

00:24:32.337 --> 00:24:33.605
THE VETTING PROCESS IS STILL

00:24:33.672 --> 00:24:36.041
THERE JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE A

00:24:36.107 --> 00:24:37.409
GREEN CARD THAT DOESN'T MEAN

00:24:37.475 --> 00:24:39.077
YOU'RE GONNA GET IN THE- THAT

00:24:39.144 --> 00:24:40.378
MEANS THAT YOU'RE ELIGIBLE. TO

00:24:40.445 --> 00:24:42.414
START THE PROCESS WHICH IS

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.416
BACKGROUND BACKGROUND AND MORE

00:24:44.482 --> 00:24:46.351
BACKGROUND CHECKS AND OF COURSE

00:24:46.418 --> 00:24:47.252
THEY HAVE THE COMMAND OF THE

00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:49.087
ENGLISH LANGUAGE IS SO IMPORTANT

00:24:49.154 --> 00:24:50.789
AND THEN IF YOU'RE BLESSED TO

00:24:50.856 --> 00:24:52.824
HAVE YOUR OTHER LANGUAGE AS YOUR

00:24:52.891 --> 00:24:54.860
SECOND LANGUAGE IMAGINE THE

00:24:54.926 --> 00:24:56.094
CONTRIBUTION YOU'RE MAKING TO

00:24:56.161 --> 00:24:58.129
YOUR COMMUNITY. AND THAT'S WHAT

00:24:58.196 --> 00:25:00.298
I THINK LAW ENFORCEMENT IS GOING

00:25:00.365 --> 00:25:01.666
FOR IS LOOKING AND HAVING PEOPLE

00:25:01.733 --> 00:25:03.969
THAT LOOK LIKE THE COMMUNITY

00:25:04.035 --> 00:25:05.537
SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND I

00:25:05.604 --> 00:25:07.505
THINK THIS IS REALLY OPEN UP SO

00:25:07.572 --> 00:25:09.241
ALONG WITH THE CHIEF OF POLICE I

00:25:09.307 --> 00:25:10.842
SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I THINK

00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:13.111
WE'LL OPEN UP THE DOOR TO

00:25:13.178 --> 00:25:14.880
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION AND

00:25:14.946 --> 00:25:16.681
CERTAINLY A PATHWAY FOR

00:25:16.748 --> 00:25:20.018
CITIZENSHIP PERSONAL. AND I

00:25:20.085 --> 00:25:22.153
REJECT AYE VOTE. THE RUBIO.

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.955
THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES

00:25:24.022 --> 00:25:25.156

00:25:25.223 --> 00:25:26.825
ALSO STAND HERE IN STRONG

00:25:26.892 --> 00:25:29.961
SUPPORT OF SB NINETY SIXTY AND

00:25:30.028 --> 00:25:31.162
WHEN APPROPRIATE I ALSO WANT T

00:25:31.229 --> 00:25:33.732
BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR I WANT

00:25:33.798 --> 00:25:35.433
TO JUST SUCK CLARIFY HERE THAT

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:38.103
WE ARE NOT CONDEMNING THE POLICE

00:25:38.169 --> 00:25:40.338
BY TRYING TO IMPROVE THE WORK

00:25:40.405 --> 00:25:42.340
FORCE AS A FORMER COUNCIL MEMBER

00:25:42.407 --> 00:25:44.309
I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS FOR

00:25:44.376 --> 00:25:46.244
US TO RECRUIT AND HOW LONG THESE

00:25:46.311 --> 00:25:48.179
POSITIONS WERE LEFT VACANT

00:25:48.246 --> 00:25:49.648
BECAUSE WE COULDN'T FIND ENOUGH

00:25:49.714 --> 00:25:51.750
PEOPLE THAT WOULD APPLY. AND

00:25:51.816 --> 00:25:53.285
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LEGALLY

00:25:53.351 --> 00:25:55.053
AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.122
ALLOWED TO WORK IN THIS COUNTRY

00:25:57.188 --> 00:25:58.556
AND IT DOESN'T DIMINISH THE

00:25:58.623 --> 00:26:02.260
ABILITY FOR OUR POLICE FORCES TO

00:26:02.327 --> 00:26:03.695
IMPLEMENT THE HIGH QUALITY

00:26:03.762 --> 00:26:04.930
STANDARDS THAT THEY'VE ALWAYS

00:26:04.996 --> 00:26:07.098
HAD THEY STILL HAVE TO GO

00:26:07.165 --> 00:26:09.868
THROUGH RIGOROUS TESTING AND

00:26:09.935 --> 00:26:10.835
BACKGROUND CHECKS. AND I HAVE

00:26:10.902 --> 00:26:12.804
EVERY CONFIDENCE THAT THEY WILL.

00:26:12.871 --> 00:26:14.673
YOU KNOW- PICK THE MOST

00:26:14.739 --> 00:26:16.274
QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS JUST LIKE

00:26:16.341 --> 00:26:19.177
THEY DO NOW REGARDLESS OF BEING.

00:26:19.244 --> 00:26:20.879
A CITIZEN OR NOT BUT AGAIN I

00:26:20.946 --> 00:26:22.147
WANT TO REITERATE THEY ARE

00:26:22.213 --> 00:26:24.950
LEGALLY ALLOWED TO WORK IN THIS

00:26:25.016 --> 00:26:26.251
COUNTRY. AND WE WILL SEND THEM

00:26:26.318 --> 00:26:28.620
TO WAR AND WE WILL YOU KNOW PUT

00:26:28.687 --> 00:26:31.022
HIM IN OTHER PROFESSIONS WHY NOT

00:26:31.089 --> 00:26:32.257
ALLOW THEM TO SERVE OUR

00:26:32.324 --> 00:26:35.427
COMMUNITIES I WILL. ALSO AGREE

00:26:35.493 --> 00:26:36.361
WITH THE FACT THAT WE NEED

00:26:36.428 --> 00:26:38.196
DIVERSITY IN OUR WORKFORCE AND

00:26:38.263 --> 00:26:40.632
MANY TIMES I FIND MYSELF

00:26:40.699 --> 00:26:43.101
TRANSLATING. FOR MANY PEOPLE

00:26:43.168 --> 00:26:44.703
EIGHT IN SOME POLICE OFFICERS AT

THERE ARE NO POLICE OFFICERS TO

00:28:51.396 --> 00:28:53.698
DO THAT. AND THIS IS AN

00:28:53.765 --> 00:28:55.233
OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:57.435

ARGUMENTS BEING MADE WHICH YOU

00:29:21.526 --> 00:29:23.094
CAN SEE IN WRITING JUST

00:29:23.161 --> 00:29:25.230
INSINUATING THAT IF SOMEONE IS

00:29:25.296 --> 00:29:27.432
NOT A CITIZEN. THEN THEY MAY BE

00:29:27.499 --> 00:29:29.367
A TERRORIST OR WE MIGHT BE

00:29:29.434 --> 00:29:30.301
TRAINING THEM SO THEY CAN GO

00:29:30.368 --> 00:29:32.570
BACK AND USE THAT IN TERRORIST

00:29:32.637 --> 00:29:34.072
ACTIVITY. AGAINST THE UNITED

JURIES THE LEGISLATURE PASSED IT

00:31:54.212 --> 00:31:56.748
AND THE RESEARCH THAT WE DID AT

00:31:56.814 --> 00:31:59.117
THE TIME INDICATED THAT 9% OF

THAT TIME WAS THAT. OUR JURY

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:17.635

00:32:17.702 --> 00:32:21.339
THAT WE LIVE IN THE PEOPLE THAT

00:32:21.406 --> 00:32:23.207
THAT THAT THE- THEIR OPINIONS

ENFORCEMENT- AND I THINK IT'S

00:33:14.058 --> 00:33:16.928

AFGHANISTAN CUBA VENEZUELA TO

00:34:10.681 --> 00:34:12.650
HAVE ACCESS TO THAT CRIMINAL

HOWEVER. THIS DOES NOT AS I DID

00:34:25.062 --> 00:34:27.899
TO CLARIFY AND IS ACCURATE THIS

00:34:27.965 --> 00:34:30.668

WITH AN AGENCY'S BACKGROUND

00:34:32.437 --> 00:34:33.938

ADEQUATELY. THEY WOULD HAVE FULL

00:34:38.876 --> 00:34:41.646
ABILITY TO NOT HIRE. AND SO THIS

00:34:41.712 --> 00:34:43.981

HAVE ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION

00:35:05.269 --> 00:35:06.671
BECAUSE THESE COUNTRIES ARE

OUR POLICE CHIEFS WHO ARE

00:39:58.729 --> 00:40:00.798
STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL

00:40:00.865 --> 00:40:02.266
IF THEY FELT THAT THIS WOULD

00:40:02.333 --> 00:40:04.368
EXCLUDE THEM FROM ANY SOURCE OF

CERTAINLY WE WILL LOOK INTO

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.208
THAT- BUT THE OTHER THING I

00:40:11.275 --> 00:40:13.177
WANTED TO MAKE CLEAR IS THAT WE

00:40:13.244 --> 00:40:14.745

AND- BUT RIGHT NOW THERE'S JUST

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:31.996

IN THIS COUNTRY AND AROUND THE

00:49:57.394 --> 00:49:58.562
WORLD. WE'RE LOSING THOSE

00:49:58.628 --> 00:50:01.965
SURVIVORS YEAR AFTER YEAR. THE

00:50:02.032 --> 00:50:04.735
HOLOCAUST IS TRAGEDY SALAMAN

00:50:04.801 --> 00:50:07.104
SAID IT'S ALMOST. IMPOSSIBLE TO

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:09.239
GET OUR MINDS AROUND WHICH IS

00:50:09.306 --> 00:50:11.641
WHY HOLOCAUST DENIALISM. HI IS

00:50:11.708 --> 00:50:13.677
SOMETIMES SO EFFECTIVE THE IDEA

00:50:13.744 --> 00:50:16.747
THAT A GOVERNMENT. WOULD SAY

00:50:16.813 --> 00:50:18.448
WE'RE GOING TO EXTERMINATE

00:50:18.515 --> 00:50:20.283
REALLY ALLOWED IN MILLION PEOPLE

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:22.285
INCLUDING SIX MILLION JEWS SIX

00:50:22.352 --> 00:50:24.087
MILLION PEOPLE FROM ONE ETHNIC

00:50:24.154 --> 00:50:27.090
GROUP WE'RE JUST GOING TO

00:50:27.157 --> 00:50:28.625
METHODICALLY PLAN. AND JUST KILL

00:50:28.692 --> 00:50:32.162
THEM EACH OF THEM. THAT THAT IS

00:50:32.229 --> 00:50:34.097
HARD TO GET THEIR MINDS AROUND

00:50:34.164 --> 00:50:35.866
AND THAT'S WHY IT IS SO

00:50:35.932 --> 00:50:37.667
IMPORTANT FOR US TO REMEMBER

00:50:37.734 --> 00:50:41.204
ALWAYS- THE PEOPLE MURDERED WERE

00:50:41.271 --> 00:50:43.240
PEOPLE LIKE US. THESE ARE

00:50:43.306 --> 00:50:45.375
MOTHERS AND FATHERS AND BROTHERS

00:50:45.442 --> 00:50:47.944
AND SISTERS AND CHILDREN YES

00:50:48.011 --> 00:50:49.746
THEY PUT CHILDREN IN THESE GAS

00:50:49.813 --> 00:50:52.048
CHAMBERS AND BURNED THEIR BODIES

00:50:52.115 --> 00:50:54.518
TO. THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO

00:50:54.584 --> 00:50:57.154
WERE LOWEST INCOME ALL THE WAY

00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:58.855
TO THE WEALTHIEST AND EVERYONE

00:50:58.922 --> 00:51:00.924
IN BETWEEN THESE WERE PEOPLE

00:51:00.991 --> 00:51:04.361
JUST LIKE US. AND THIS IS IN A

00:51:04.428 --> 00:51:05.629
EMANATING FROM A COUNTRY THAT

00:51:05.695 --> 00:51:09.099
BEFORE. HELLO TOOK OVER. WAS

00:51:09.166 --> 00:51:11.468
CONSIDERED A PROGRESSIVE FORWARD

00:51:11.535 --> 00:51:15.071
LOOKING COUNTRY. WHERE JEWS WERE

00:51:15.138 --> 00:51:16.873
LGBTQ PEOPLE AT CETERA WERE

00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:21.845
ACCEPTED. AND THEN IT TURNS AND

00:51:21.912 --> 00:51:23.280
SIX MILLION JEWS AND FIVE

00:51:23.346 --> 00:51:25.015
MILLION OTHERS WERE METHODICALLY

00:51:25.081 --> 00:51:28.285
EXTERMINATED. WE NEED TO BE

00:51:28.351 --> 00:51:31.521
CLEAR THAT THE HATRED AND THE

00:51:31.588 --> 00:51:33.623
VIOLENCE THAT LED TO THE

00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:35.992
HOLOCAUST AS I MENTIONED DIDN'T

00:51:36.059 --> 00:51:39.496
JUST RANDOMLY HAPPEN IT BUILT UP

DEMONISATION OF JEWS WHEN WE

CHANTING JEWS WILL NOT REPLACE

00:51:59.783 --> 00:52:01.651
US THE REPLACEMENT THEORY THAT

00:52:01.718 --> 00:52:04.387

OF OUR HISTORY THAT WE NEED TO

01:08:57.132 --> 01:08:58.701

YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES THOSE

01:09:59.929 --> 01:10:02.765
MEMORIES RUSH BACK. TO LIVE WITH

01:10:02.831 --> 01:10:03.899
THAT EXPERIENCE I WALK AROUND

AND SYSTEM RESILIENCE IT'S

01:10:14.276 --> 01:10:17.079
ARRESTING IT CHANGES THE WAY YOU

THINK ABOUT GOING ABOUT YOUR DAY

01:10:19.281 --> 01:10:20.416
. AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO

01:10:20.482 --> 01:10:22.418
SURVIVED THE KILLING FIELDS OF

01:10:22.484 --> 01:10:25.387
CAMBODIA WHO WALK AROUND. OUR

01:10:25.454 --> 01:10:28.324
OUR STREETS IN LA IN CALIFORNIA

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:30.259
. WHO HAVE THAT SAME EXPERIENCE

01:10:30.326 --> 01:10:31.961
WATCHING THEIR FAMILIES GO

01:10:32.027 --> 01:10:33.028
PEOPLE IMMIGRATED FROM EL

01:10:33.095 --> 01:10:34.897
SALVADOR IN THE EIGHTIES

01:10:34.964 --> 01:10:37.700
WATCHING THEIR FAMILY'S GONE.

01:10:37.766 --> 01:10:40.402
THERE'S NOTHING. UNFORTUNATELY

01:10:40.469 --> 01:10:42.771
UNIQUE ABOUT THIS HISTORY OF

01:10:42.838 --> 01:10:45.474
TRAUMA THIS GENOCIDE WAS ON A

01:10:45.541 --> 01:10:47.676
DIFFERENT SCALE THAN WE'VE EVER

01:10:47.743 --> 01:10:49.078
SEEN BUT LET US NOT MAKE THE

01:10:49.144 --> 01:10:52.681
HOLOCAUST SOMETHING IT'S SO FAR

01:10:52.748 --> 01:10:53.849
OUT OF REACH THAT IT COULD NOT

01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:55.084
EVER HAPPEN AGAIN. AND THAT WE

01:10:55.150 --> 01:10:57.219
CAN'T SURVIVE FROM. AND LIVE

01:10:57.286 --> 01:10:59.388
THROUGH WITH SOME DIGNITY. SO

01:10:59.455 --> 01:11:01.090
WHEN YOU'RE ASKING YOURSELVES

01:11:01.156 --> 01:11:03.859
HOW DO I REMEMBER AND HOW DO I

01:11:03.926 --> 01:11:06.328
CARRY THAT TORCH. HOW DO WE

01:11:06.395 --> 01:11:09.231
SURVIVE BEYOND SURVIVAL. HOW DO

01:11:09.298 --> 01:11:11.433
WE EDUCATE OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WHEN

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:12.434
THE ACTUAL WITNESSES ARE NOT

01:11:12.501 --> 01:11:14.603
THERE TO TESTIFY ANYMORE IT'S ON

01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:16.405
US TO DO THAT. I WOULD SAY TO

01:11:16.472 --> 01:11:18.407
THINK ABOUT. THESE NEXT FEW

01:11:18.474 --> 01:11:20.609
YEARS IS VERY PRECIOUS MOMENTS.

01:11:20.676 --> 01:11:23.312
THERE ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND

01:11:23.379 --> 01:11:24.146
SURVIVORS STILL LIVING IN

01:11:24.213 --> 01:11:27.282
CALIFORNIA. ABOUT 50% OF THOSE

01:11:27.349 --> 01:11:29.752
SURVIVORS STILL WITH US IN LA

01:11:29.818 --> 01:11:31.587
SAN DIEGO AND SAN FRANCISCO IN

01:11:31.654 --> 01:11:34.723
PARTICULAR. 50% ARE LIVING BELOW

01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:36.925
THE POVERTY LINE. SO IN YOUR

01:11:36.992 --> 01:11:39.561
COMMUNITY THERE IS SOMEBODY WHO

01:11:39.628 --> 01:11:42.464
WENT THROUGH ALL THAT. WORKED

01:11:42.531 --> 01:11:44.166
DID SOME QUIET JOB THAT NO ONE

01:11:44.233 --> 01:11:45.401
EVER NOTICED AND THEY NEVER

01:11:45.467 --> 01:11:47.202
TALKED ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST THEY

01:11:47.269 --> 01:11:48.771
SERVE FOOD AT A DINER THEY

01:11:48.837 --> 01:11:50.205
WORKED ON YOUR PLUMBING THEY

01:11:50.272 --> 01:11:52.174
HELP TAKE CARE OF YOUR KIDS THEY

01:11:52.241 --> 01:11:54.309
DID THEIR WORK. JUST LIKE

01:11:54.376 --> 01:11:56.879
EVERYONE ELSE DOES IN THE STATE

01:11:56.945 --> 01:11:58.080
. AND NOW THEY'RE AT THE END OF

01:11:58.147 --> 01:12:01.750
THEIR LIFE. AND DIGNITY IS OUT

01:12:01.817 --> 01:12:05.020
OF REACH. LITERALLY DON'T HAVE

01:12:05.087 --> 01:12:06.955
ACCESS TO FOOD ON THE TABLE.

01:12:07.022 --> 01:12:09.291
BEING FORCED INTO SUB STANDARD

01:12:09.358 --> 01:12:10.893
LIVING CONDITIONS IN CONGREGATE

01:12:10.959 --> 01:12:14.263
CARE WITHOUT ACCESS. TO ANYONE

01:12:14.329 --> 01:12:15.497
ON THE CALL BUTTON TO TAKE CARE

01:12:15.564 --> 01:12:20.936
OF THEM. THE CITY. IN THEIR OWN

01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:23.706
. DIAPERS AND THEIR EXPERIMENT

01:12:23.772 --> 01:12:26.575
SITTING THERE FOR DAYS. NOT

01:12:26.642 --> 01:12:28.744
BEING TAKEN CARE OF BECAUSE

01:12:28.811 --> 01:12:33.315
YOU'VE GOT IT OUR CARE SYSTEM.

01:12:33.382 --> 01:12:37.052
NOT ABLE TO TAKE A SHOWER OR-

01:12:37.119 --> 01:12:38.721
WHEN KOBE HITS AGAIN BE SENT TO

01:12:38.787 --> 01:12:40.322
THE YELLOWSTONE OF THE GREENS ON

01:12:40.389 --> 01:12:41.290
BECAUSE YOU'RE LITERALLY

01:12:41.356 --> 01:12:42.391
TRIGGERING ALL THAT FROM AGAIN

01:12:42.458 --> 01:12:44.293
YOU'RE SAYING NOW IS THE TIME TO

01:12:44.359 --> 01:12:46.361
TAKE A SHOWER NOW YOU HAVE TO GO

01:12:46.428 --> 01:12:48.230
TO THE GREENS ARE NICE TO GO TO.

01:12:48.297 --> 01:12:49.364
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO THE TRAUMA

01:12:49.431 --> 01:12:51.400
AND THEY'RE DYING RIGHT NOW. AND

01:12:51.467 --> 01:12:53.268
WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT. WE

01:12:53.335 --> 01:12:55.404
CAN PROVIDE CARE AT THE END OF

01:12:55.471 --> 01:12:59.441
LIFE. I THINK INVESTING. IN THAT

01:12:59.508 --> 01:13:02.745
DIGNITY RIGHT NOW. IS THE MOST

01:13:02.811 --> 01:13:04.747
POWERFUL WAY WE CAN REMEMBER

01:13:04.813 --> 01:13:06.348
BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT IF WE

01:13:06.415 --> 01:13:08.517
INVEST IN THAT DIGNITY NOT JUST

01:13:08.584 --> 01:13:09.518
FOR SURVIVORS OF THIS HOLOCAUST

01:13:09.585 --> 01:13:11.253
BUT FOR EVERYONE ELSE WHO DOES

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.155

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:14.890
LIFE AND ENDED THAT WAY. AFTER

01:13:20.295 --> 01:13:24.299

CALIFORNIA ABOUT HOW OUR

INVESTMENT IS MAKING A

01:18:10.886 --> 01:18:14.389
DIFFERENCE ON THIS TOPIC. I

01:18:14.456 --> 01:18:16.858
THERE WAS A SOME PRETTY UGLY

01:18:16.925 --> 01:18:18.560
INCIDENTS THAT TOOK PLACE IN

01:18:18.627 --> 01:18:19.161
SOME CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOLS A

01:18:19.227 --> 01:18:22.364
FEW YEARS BACK WHERE TEENAGERS

01:18:22.431 --> 01:18:24.533
GOT TOGETHER AND SINGING ****

01:18:24.599 --> 01:18:29.671
SONGS- SET UP COPS IN A-

01:18:29.738 --> 01:18:32.274

01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:37.212
MADE LIGHT. OF THE IMAGERY. AND

01:18:37.279 --> 01:18:40.248
MILITARISM OF THE **** REGIME. I

01:18:40.315 --> 01:18:42.651
DO HAVE BEEN SO EASY FOR PEOPLE

01:18:42.717 --> 01:18:44.886
TO CONDEMN THESE YOUNG PEOPLE

01:18:44.953 --> 01:18:49.391
CALL THEM BIGOTS RACISTS. VILIFY

01:18:49.458 --> 01:18:52.394
THEM CANCEL THEM. THAT WOULD

01:18:52.461 --> 01:18:55.030
HAVE BEEN THE EASY THING TO DO

01:18:55.097 --> 01:18:55.864
RIGHT BECAUSE WHAT THEY DONE WAS

01:18:55.931 --> 01:18:58.433
VERY UGLY. AND YET- THERE WERE

01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:00.202
PEOPLE WHO RECOGNIZE THESE WERE

01:19:00.268 --> 01:19:02.838
KIDS THESE WERE THESE ARE YOUNG

01:19:02.904 --> 01:19:03.438
PEOPLE WHO REALLY DIDN'T KNOW

01:19:03.505 --> 01:19:05.540
BETTER IF ANYTHING THEIR ACTIONS

01:19:05.607 --> 01:19:07.542
WERE MARKED BY THEIR IGNORANCE

01:19:07.609 --> 01:19:09.611
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. AND THE

01:19:09.678 --> 01:19:10.712
LOS ANGELES MUSEUM OF THE

01:19:10.779 --> 01:19:12.047
HOLOCAUST WHICH IS AN

01:19:12.114 --> 01:19:13.915
EXTRAORDINARY INSTITUTION- THAT

01:19:13.982 --> 01:19:18.286
WE'VE HELPED TO FIND. I DIDN'T

01:19:18.353 --> 01:19:19.855
PUSH THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ASIDE

01:19:19.921 --> 01:19:21.556
THEY INVITED THEM TO THE MUSEUM

01:19:21.623 --> 01:19:23.625
THEY BROUGHT THEY PAID TO BRING

01:19:23.692 --> 01:19:25.994
THEM TO THE MUSEUM. WHERE THEY

01:19:26.061 --> 01:19:26.795
LEARNED ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST MANY

01:19:26.862 --> 01:19:29.364
OF THEM. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A

01:19:29.431 --> 01:19:31.032
VERY REAL WAY. WHERE THEY MET

01:19:31.099 --> 01:19:33.034
WITH SURVIVORS SOME OF THOSE FEW

01:19:33.101 --> 01:19:34.669
PRECIOUS SURVIVORS. THAT ARE

01:19:34.736 --> 01:19:37.839
STILL WALKING AMONG US. SAT IN A

01:19:37.906 --> 01:19:40.075
SMALL ROOM WITH THOSE SURVIVORS

01:19:40.142 --> 01:19:43.879
HEARD THEIR STORIES. AND IT

01:19:43.945 --> 01:19:45.113
CHANGED OUR LIVES FOREVER I'VE

01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:46.915
HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF READING

01:19:46.982 --> 01:19:48.283
SOME OF THE LETTERS OF THESE

01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:50.585
YOUNG PEOPLE WROTE TO THE MUSEUM

01:19:50.652 --> 01:19:51.119
AFTERWARDS WHERE THEY JUST

01:19:51.186 --> 01:19:52.320
POURED THEIR HEARTS OUT. IN

01:19:52.387 --> 01:19:56.491
REGRET. TALKING ABOUT HOW LITTLE

01:19:56.558 --> 01:19:58.560
THEY KNEW OF WHAT THEY WERE

01:19:58.627 --> 01:20:01.596
DOING WHEN THEY BEHAVED IN. SUCH

01:20:01.663 --> 01:20:07.135
A DISRESPECTFUL MANNER. AND THAT

01:20:07.202 --> 01:20:09.004
EXPERIENCE CHANGE OUR LIVES

01:20:09.070 --> 01:20:10.605
FOREVER AND I THINK THAT THERE

01:20:10.672 --> 01:20:12.207
ARE SO MANY OF THESE ACTS THAT

01:20:12.274 --> 01:20:13.308
ARE HAPPENING UP AND DOWN OUR

01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:15.310
STATE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY ALL

01:20:15.377 --> 01:20:16.912
OVER THE WORLD MUSEUMS CULTURAL

01:20:16.978 --> 01:20:20.715
CENTERS EDUCATORS WHO ARE

01:20:20.782 --> 01:20:23.418
EXPOSING THE NEXT GENERATION. I

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:26.021
TO THIS UGLY HISTORY. WE HAVE TO

01:20:26.087 --> 01:20:27.589
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CONTINUED

01:20:27.656 --> 01:20:29.124
PRESENCE OF THOSE SURVIVORS

01:20:29.191 --> 01:20:30.492
THOSE PRECIOUS SURVIVORS THAT

01:20:30.559 --> 01:20:31.927
CAN STILL SPEAK TO THESE YOUNG

01:20:31.993 --> 01:20:34.796
PEOPLE. ARE SO ELOQUENTLY AND SO

01:20:34.863 --> 01:20:36.031
DIRECTLY OF COURSE ALL THE

01:20:36.097 --> 01:20:37.699
SURVIVORS WHO ARE LEFT WERE

01:20:37.766 --> 01:20:39.201
CHILDREN THEMSELVES WHEN THE

01:20:39.267 --> 01:20:41.570
HOLOCAUST TOOK PLACE AND I THINK

01:20:41.636 --> 01:20:42.671
THERE'S A SPECIAL CONNECTION.

01:20:42.737 --> 01:20:44.239
THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHEN THEY TELL

01:20:44.306 --> 01:20:45.807
THEIR STORIES OF HAVING SURVIVED

01:20:45.874 --> 01:20:47.943
THE HOLOCAUST AS A CHILD AS A

01:20:48.009 --> 01:20:51.880
TEENAGER AS A YOUNG PERSON. SO

01:20:51.947 --> 01:20:53.448
WE CAN AND MUST INVEST IN THESE

01:20:53.515 --> 01:20:55.183
KINDS OF INSTITUTIONS AND THESE

01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:57.819
AND THIS SORT OF GRACE AND LOVE

01:20:57.886 --> 01:20:59.421
WHICH IS WHAT THAT MUSEUM SHOW

01:20:59.487 --> 01:21:02.290
TO THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE. AND IN SO

01:21:02.357 --> 01:21:04.726
DOING MADE IT SO MUCH LESS

01:21:04.793 --> 01:21:06.695
LIKELY THAT- THAT THEY WILL EVER

01:21:06.761 --> 01:21:08.763
ACT IN THE BIGOTED MANNER IN THE

01:21:08.830 --> 01:21:12.367
FUTURE. AND SO I WANT US TO AS

01:21:12.434 --> 01:21:15.704
WE REFLECT WITH GREAT SORROW.

01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:17.339
BASED ON THE LEGACY OF THE

01:21:17.405 --> 01:21:18.873
HOLOCAUST I ALSO WANT TO BE

01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:19.975
INSPIRED BY THE INCREDIBLE

01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:21.209
EDUCATING WORK THAT IS HAPPENING

01:21:21.276 --> 01:21:22.777
RIGHT NOW HERE IN OUR STATE IN

01:21:22.844 --> 01:21:24.179
SO MANY WONDERFUL INSTITUTIONS

01:21:24.246 --> 01:21:25.780

01:21:25.847 --> 01:21:30.719

THERE ABOUT THIRTY FIVE MILLION

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:03.351
PEOPLE THAT WERE THERE AND AT

SCHOLARSHIP THAT'S GOING ON IN

01:22:20.835 --> 01:22:22.470

WORK T. TWO. GET MORE GRANULAR

01:22:29.844 --> 01:22:31.746
AND UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECT OF

THAT FINAL SOLUTION ON THE

01:22:32.847 --> 01:22:34.716
JEWISH QUESTION BECAUSE THE

01:22:34.783 --> 01:22:36.151
FINAL SOLUTION WAS THE

01:22:36.217 --> 01:22:39.521
EXTERMINATION OF ALL FLOCKS. YOU

01:22:39.587 --> 01:22:40.789

THAT WERE ALSO KILLED. IN

01:22:50.131 --> 01:22:51.499
INTELLIGENCE THE COMMUNIST

01:22:51.566 --> 01:22:54.002
ANYBODY THAT DISAGREED. WITH

TODAY TO EXTERMINATE ALL OF THEM

01:23:19.227 --> 01:23:22.764
I MEAN IT IT THE HORROR IS NOT

01:23:22.831 --> 01:23:26.468
ONLY THE SYSTEMATIC PLANNING OF

01:23:26.534 --> 01:23:28.803
THIS EXTERMINATION BUT THEN THE

01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:32.741
THIS EXECUTION AND- IT. WHEN WE

01:23:32.807 --> 01:23:34.909
REMEMBER THE WORD THAT WE LOOK

01:23:34.976 --> 01:23:36.044
AT CURRENT EVENTS THAT ARE

01:23:36.111 --> 01:23:38.947
HAPPENING AND IT SHOULD SPARK

01:23:39.013 --> 01:23:42.283
OUR ATTENTION AND OUR AND OUR-

01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:45.787

SUPPORT IT'S VERY SAD OCCASION

01:23:55.230 --> 01:23:56.231
BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT CATION TO

01:23:56.297 --> 01:24:00.769
REMEMBER. SENATOR GLAZERS. THANK

FOR SO MANY OF US. I WANT TO DO

01:24:07.942 --> 01:24:10.445
I SHARE WITH YOU THAT. THE

01:24:10.512 --> 01:24:15.016
MEMORIES OF A YOUNG BOY- IT'S

01:24:15.083 --> 01:24:17.819
PROBABLY SIX OR SEVEN YEARS OLD

01:24:17.886 --> 01:24:18.420
TWENTY YEARS PAST THE END OF

01:24:18.486 --> 01:24:21.356
WORLD WAR TWO AND THE STORIES OF

01:24:21.423 --> 01:24:22.991
WHAT HAPPENED WERE PROFOUND IN

01:24:23.057 --> 01:24:27.796
RELIGIOUS SCHOOL. AND THE. IN

01:24:27.862 --> 01:24:30.465
THAT TRAUMA YEAH WE ALL HANDLE

01:24:30.532 --> 01:24:33.134
IT DIFFERENTLY FOR ME IT WAS TO

01:24:33.201 --> 01:24:36.004
PUT MY HEAD ON THE PILLOW AT

01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:41.943
NIGHT. AND THINK TO MYSELF- WHAT

01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:44.412
IF I WAS IN GERMANY. DURING THAT

01:24:44.479 --> 01:24:49.717
TIME. OR WHAT IF I WAS IN POLAND

01:24:49.784 --> 01:24:51.586
. WHAT IF I WAS IN FRANCE WHAT

01:24:51.653 --> 01:24:56.191
WOULD I. WHAT WOULD I KNOW. WHAT

01:24:56.257 --> 01:25:02.197
WHAT I HEAR. WHAT WOULD I SEE.

01:25:02.263 --> 01:25:04.566
AND WHAT WOULD I DO WHAT WOULD I

01:25:04.632 --> 01:25:12.140
DO- IT'S PRETTY PRETTY SCARY

01:25:12.207 --> 01:25:16.444
THOUGHTS FOR A YOUNG BOY. AND IT

01:25:16.511 --> 01:25:18.279
