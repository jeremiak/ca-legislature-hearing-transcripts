OKAY THEM NOW WILL BE IT BACK. TO COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR. OUR VICE CHAIR MISTER LACKEY THE FIRST WAS CERTAINLY HAVE SOME OF TO THIS PROPOSED. AS A- MANY OF THE MEMBERS HAVE A HEARD MOST OF MY- FRUSTRATION WITH THIS PARTICULAR BILL. AS EXPRESSED ON THE FLOOR PRETTY DECENTLY MOST OF MY OPPOSITION WAS STATED BY MR MORRIS THE DA- WHEN WE HEAR THE TERM. LOW LEVEL OFFENDERS I'M STRUCK BY THAT BECAUSE IT DEPENDS I THINK IF YOU ASK MANY OF THESE VICTIMS. THEY WOULD DISAGREE WITH THAT CHARACTERIZATION. AND I THINK- THIS DESERVES A LOT OF CONSIDERATION ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HEARD THE JUDGE. REFER TO IT AB TWENTY TWENTY FOR THE- PILOT PROGRAM. IT PILOT PROGRAM IT WAS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN WHAT'S BEEN PROPOSED RIGHT NOW- THIS THIS PARTICULAR. ALL HAS NO LIMIT ON OFFENSES. AND THAT IT HAD MULTIPLE HAS YOU HEARD- EXPRESSED BY MISTER MORRIS. I'M A LITTLE BIT MADE BY FIFTY YEARS OLD BEING ELDERLY. AND THE DA'S I'LL JUST CLOSE WITH THIS THE DA'S HAD THE JUST. OF A HANDLING THIS. AS IS BEING CONSIDER BY THE J. TO SOMETHING. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S THE WAY IT SHOULD REMAIN I THINK THIS IS VERY VERY DANGEROUS. AND I CAN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. YES MISTER CHANG JUST A QUICK IN YOUR OPENING YOU REF AS THAT SAID THAT ONLY INDIVIDUALS AND HAVE GREAT I ALSO. FIFTY DOESN'T SEEM OUT MEANS HISTORY IN THAT STUFF WHAT THEY THEY DEFINE ELDERLY IT'S A- IT'S A GOOD. I DON'T HAVE THE STUDY FRONT OF I'M HAPPY TO GET THAT. BACK TO YOU. I DON'T KNOW IF MISTER IS FOR WITH STUDY OF. MISTER KING ARE YOU ON THE LINE. I AM THIS IS A SIDE OF JUSTICE POLICY INSTITUTE. LEAVE IT TO THE- NUMBER IN THE JUSTICE POLICY INSTITUTE WAS FIFTY FIVE I'M NOT CERTAIN ABOUT THAT THOUGH. OKAY THANK YOU AND WE CAN FOLLOW UP AND FIND OUT AFTER TODAY BUT I ALSO JUST WANT TO REITERATE THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE ABOUT I THINK THAT JUDGE LOW INTEL'S COMMENTS ON THE SUCCESS OF THE LA DIVERT. BLACK WHAT WANT TO SEE OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM WHICH AN OPPORTUNE FOR CERTAIN OFFENDERS TO I'M- TO GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE IT RIGHT AND- BUT THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT EXT SINCE MARRIAGE EVEN WITH THOSE EXCEPTIONS WE SAW THE NUMBERS HE REFLECTED A HUGE BOTH COST SAVINGS AND SUCCESS RATE IN THOSE IN THAT PART I WOULD REALLY WILL A CLOSE. OKAY MISTER CORE. THAT WAS TWENTY FOUR YEARS AGO WELL. LOOK YOU'RE IN PRISON YOUR HEALTH IS NOT THE RESULT YOU'RE YOU'RE PRETTY WELL BY THE TIME THE FOOD EIGHT SPOKE YEARS. THIS MORE THAN ANYTHING FULLER. LOS FOLKS AND SO THE BUFFALO MORE THAN THE FIFTY. SO I REALLY THAT THE IS SOMETHING THAT I BE THE FOR MOORE HAD MOVED THE BALL NOW. COLUSA INTEREST. SO I. FIFTY FIVE. I WORKED FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS. THE FOLDERS ALL UP UP ONLY ABOUT A THIRD. SO PEARL HAS DISCRETION. WITH REGARD TO THE DIVERSION PROGRAM IS FIFTEEN TO ONE OF OUR FLOW WHAT WELL EXCEPTIONS YOU DO HAVE SOME OF HIS. WE WERE TOLD WERE NOT IN THE BILL ONE OF. THE ALL I WAS GOING TO LET THAT JUDGE- PERHAPS EXPRESS- YOU KNOW WHY IN HIS OPINION IT MADE SENSE TO INCLUDE CATEGORIES THAT WERE EXCLUDED AND- L. A. COUNTY PILOT SO IF YOU COULD. IF YOU COULD ADDRESS ASK QUESTIONS HE'S HERE. FOUR SO THERE ARE OVER THOUSAND CRIMES IN OUR- PENAL CODE IN OTHER ASSOCIATED CODE- THAT ARE PRESCRIBED. OUTED OUT OVER FIVE THOUSAND- WELL OVER FIVE THOUSAND CRIMES THERE WERE ABOUT EIGHT THAT WERE EXCLUDED FROM- DIVERSION CONSIDERATION IN AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY FOUR AB THIRTY TWO FOUR DOESN'T. CONTAIN THOSE EXCLUSIONS- FOR THE REASON THAT EVEN THOUGH IT IS UNLIKELY THAT A JUDGE WOULD EXTEND DIVERSION IN SOME OF THOSE. EIGHT TYPES OF CASES CASES THAT INVOLVED A SEXUAL OFFENDER REGISTRATION PURSUANT TO. EIGHTY TO NINETY EIGHT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THIRTY WHY DEADLY OR DANGEROUS WEAPON ON IT IS POSSIBLE THAT INTERSTATE WITH FORTY MILLION PEOPLE UNIQUE CASES COLORIZED THERE WAS ONE PUBLISHED CASE- THEY CAME OUT OF. L. A. COUNTY TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IN WHICH I PERSONALLY GRANTED DIVERSION IN A DEADLY OR DANGEROUS WEAPON CASE AND THAT WAS EXCLUDED AND I WAS REVERSED AND- I THINK IT ILLUSTRATES THE PROPRIETY OF NOT HAVING EXCLUSION THAT WAS THE CASE. INVOLVED A FORTY THREE YEAR OLD. WITH NO CRIMINAL RECORD WHO GOT PULLED OVER ON A ROUTINE TRAFFIC STOP IN IN THE TRUNK OF HIS CAR HE HAD NOT. HE SAID THE NINE CHECKS BELONG TO EIGHTEEN OLD SON IT WAS UNCLEAR. I TO WHOM THEY BELONGED I THOUGHT THAT WAS AN APPROPRIATE CASE TO. GET OFFER DIVERSION- BUT BECAUSE THAT WAS CONSIDERED A DEADLY OR DANGEROUS WEAPON IT WAS MY DECISION WAS REVERSED. I THINK THAT IT HIGHLIGHTS THEIR IN-SUCH A HUGE STATE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO ALWAYS ANTICIPATE WHAT CASES MIGHT COME UP AND INSTEAD I THINK IT'S SAFE TO TRUST THE DISCRETION OF JUDGES TO- APPLY TO VERSION ONE APPROPRIATE. YOU REMOTE QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE COMMON. KAMLAGER THANK YOU MR TANG I WAS- WANTED TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY- COLLEAGUE. IN THE BACK SO WELL PROTECTED- THERE WAS A STUDY ACTUALLY THAT CAME OUT THAT THAT CALIFORNIA'S OWNERS MEANT BY CALIFORNIA'S OWN ASSESSMENT ABOUT 50% OF OUR INCARCERATED I. AT VERY LOW RISK OF RECIDIVISM OF ANY KIND- AND MOST OF THE FOLKS IN THAT STUDY ARE ELDERLY. I'M EVEN MIDDLE AGED AND SICK AND ESSENTIALLY HAVE AGED OUT OF CRIME AND I DO BELIEVE THERE WAS A SENTENCING REPORT THAT CAME OUT THAT SET. FOR WHO ARE SENIOR. THERE'S ACTUALLY LESS THAN A TEN PERSON CHANCE OF RECIDIVISM I. ALSO BELIEVE I THINK AT THE AGE OF FORTY NINE OR SO A RP BEGIN TO SEND YOU- YOU'RE BENEFIT. YOU TO SIGN IT BECAUSE THEY'RE WAITING FOR YOU TO TURN FIFTY I WAS WONDERING IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION OR CONSIDER MAYBE YOU CAN ADDRESS THIS IN YOUR CLOTHES. THE RECIDIVISM RATES OF THOSE WHO ARE ELDERLY ARE INDOOR ARE SICK OF REAL. WHO HAVE BEEN RELEASED SO YOU HAVE THAT INFORMATION MAYBE THAT WOULD BE GREAT SHARE IN THE CLOTHES- AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYMORE COMMENTS THEN YOU MAY CLOSE MISTER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR FIRST LET ME JUST AGAIN. REITERATE THAT THIS IS A PROPOSAL FOR JUDICIAL DISCRETION AROUND MISDEMEANOR DIVERSION IT IS NOT A AUTOMATIC. DIVERSION PROGRAM IT IS NOT A PRESCRIPTIVE DIVERSION PROGRAM- I THINK JUDGE LOW FALLS EXAMPLES EXCELLENT- THE NUMB TRUCK INCIDENT IS VERY- VERY COMICAL BECAUSE THE BECAUSE- COULD HAVE BEEN AFTER CARRYING. PROP FORGOT TO RESIDENTS A DEAD WEAPON I THINK IT IS. THAT CALIFORNIA AND I KNOW I NOTED THAT BECAUSE ABOUT BELIEVE ARIZONA JUST RECENTLY- LABELED NUN CHUCKS NOT A DEADLY WEAPON I THINK IT IS ON THAT CALIFORNIA STILL LABELS NUMBER DALY RIGHT. I'M I THINK UNDER THE RIGHT BUDGET OFTEN THAT PARTICULAR. THE CITY. FROM IN TERMS OF ELDERLY PAROLE AGAIN IT IS JUST INCREASING THE POOL OF PEOPLE WHO COULD GO BEFORE THE PAROLE BOARD DOES NOT PRESCRIBE PAROLE IT DOES NOT TELL THE PAROLE BOARD. AFTER THESE VIGILS AS- PART MAKE UP OF THE PAROLE BOARD IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO GET PAROLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EVEN AS WE INCREASE THE POOL. IN ADDITION MAKES A COMPLETE FISCAL SENSE TO GO BROACH BECAUSE WITH THE ELDERLY POOR- YOU KNOW WALL ON AVERAGE WHAT WE SPEND ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER INTO. OF FOR. TO REACH INTO. IT IS UP OF TO THE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR FOR ELDERLY PERSONS BECAUSE THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN HEALTHCARE COSTS AND DR CORPUS ACTUALLY RIGHT THAT A FIFTY YEAR OLD WHO'S BEEN IMPRISONED FOR TWENTY YEARS. NOT HAVE THE HEALTH AND VITALITY OF THE CHROME. AT MORSE PARTICULATE I THINK THEY HAVE- VERY DIFFERENT LIFE EXPECTANCY THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT HEALTH- I DON'T KNOW THAT ANY OF US I'M SURE NONE OF US WOULD LIKE TO HAVE BEEN AND THEN FOR TWENTY YEARS TO. SPEND THAT. IMPACTED HAVE OUR HEALTH. SO AGAIN HE GIVES JUDGES THE DISK AS IT DOES THEY DO FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEYS. I DOESN'T EVEN GIVEN THE LAST QUESTION RETURNEES GET ALSO. I THE WITH THE DISH ATTORNEY'S. APPLE YOUR AGO TO GET THE DISK WHICH WHEN THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE- SENTENCE HAD OVERLY PUNITIVE CENSUS FOR THE DOES DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND THOSE JUDGES TO WORK TOGETHER TO GET THOSE SENTENCED ON THE SAN DIEGO DISTRICT ATTORNEY TWENTY UTILIZED OUT ALL. BUT THE FACT THAT WE'VE GOTTEN FROM ALL THE DIFFERENT COMPANIES IS THEY DON'T HAVE STAFFING ABILITY WELL THEY DO IN THIS TO GO IN THEY DO BILITY NOT THIS LAW WE PASSED UP YEARS AGO. THEY DON'T HAVE. SO IN. OF THE RE THE DIVERSE HOUSING BEEN FULLY YOU'LL THIS AGAIN THIS IS NOT A NUMBER ONE ON THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S DO LIST IS NOT SOMETHING THAT US TO SET ASIDE TWO AND WHEN YOU HAVE A JUDGE'S AS IT IS GET BROUGHT FORWARD THEM JEFF. NOW INDIVIDUAL WHO WOULD REALLY MAKE A DECISION YOU'RE PAYING HIS OR HER DISCRETION SO AND- WE ARE BUILT FOR THIRD TO THIRTY. PLUS THE CHAIR FOR LETTING ME FIRST TO. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR THE BILL. AND THANK YOU IN I THINK YOU SHOULD ALSO THANK SENATOR TO LEAD A GROUP A LOT. THANK YOU SENATOR ARCHULETA FOR SAID. CORRECT I VOTE SPACE. WHAT I FOUND IN WITH WITH JUDGE NDAS THEY BOTH HAVE A VERY HIGH BAR WHEN IT COMES TO RELEASING INDIVIDUALS FROM PRISON AND- I TRUST THAT THE SAME HIGH STANDARDS. AS WE MOVE TOWARD THE OVER JUDGE WHAT WILL STILL BE THERE AND THAT OF WE SHOULD BE SHOULD SAFE AND SECURE THAT THE JUDGES WILL WILL. MAKE SURE AND ALSO THE PAROLE BOARD WHICH ALSO HAS A VERY VERY HIGH. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC IS SAFE WITH THAT IT DID THE FIRST IN THE SECOND. VENTURE WE CALL THE ROLL.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOING TO. THE SENATE BILL FOUR EIGHTY FIRST. OKAY HERE WE GO- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I WOULD LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. TODAY I'M PRESENTING. SENATE BILL FOR EIGHTY THAT WOULD. LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES FROM AUTHORIZING THEIR OFFICERS TO WEAR UNIFORMS THAT ARE COMMON FLIGHTS OR SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES ESPECIALLY THE NATIONAL GUARD. OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS I'M SURE MANY OF YOU HAVE SEEN PHOTOS. AND VIDEOS OF ON FORSMAN AT PROTESTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WITH SOME OFFICERS WEARING HEAD TO TOE COMMA FLIGHT PATTERNS. FOR THE AVERAGE CITIZEN THESE YOU KNOW BEAR SUCH A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE TO THOSE WARM BUYER MILLER. THAT MANY HAVE TROUBLE TELLING THE TO SUPPORT AS WE SAW WHEN THE MEDIA TRIBUTE ACTION PERFORMED BY LOCAL POLICE TO THE NATIONAL. THIS IS WRONG AND WE SHOULD BE PURPOSELY MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS ESPECIALLY WHEN POLICE AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE MEANT TO SERVE VASTLY DIFFERENT ROLES IN AMERICAN SOCIETY. WHEREAS OUR LOCAL FORSMAN IS HERE TO SERVE AND PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES OUR MILITARY HAS A DUTY TO SUPPORT AND DEFEND OUR CONSTITUTION AGAINST ENEMIES. THE MILITARY CAMOUFLAGE UNIFORM OF OUR ARMED SERVICES SERVICE SPECIFIC FUNCTION TO DECEIVE THE ENEMY. AS TO THE PRESIDENT'S POSITION AND INTENTIONS OF MILITARY FORMATIONS. POLICE ON THE OTHER HAND WEAR UNIFORMS THAT EASILY IDENTIFIED THEM AS MEMBERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. OUTSIDE OF TACTICAL OPERATIONS WHICH ARE EXEMPT FROM THIS BILL THAT THE PURPOSE OF CONCEALMENT SHOULD NEVER BE USED BY POLICE OFFICERS WHILE ON DUTY FOR EVERYDAY PATROL CRIME FROM RUSSIAN OR WHILE AT AN ADVANTAGE. IF COME OF LIFE IS MEANT TO OBSCURE MOVEMENTS THEN IN A PROTEST SCENARIO OUR POLICE SHOULD BE CLEARLY VISIBLE ENGAGING ALL AND TEMPS TO DE ESCALATE THE SITUATION. THESE CASES NOT ONLY OUR MILITARY STYLE UNIFORMS THE INAPPROPRIATE UNIFORMS BUT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT YES THE MERE PRESENCE OF I'M CAN INVITE HERE. AND DISTRUST WITH THE COMMUNITIES THAT OUR POLICE OFFICERS ARE THERE TO SERVE. BY MINUTE IN THE FUSION BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT SENATE BILL FOUR EIGHTY HELP. THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC WHILE ALSO HELPING TO IT OUR NATIONAL GUARD MEMBERS AND POLICE OFFICERS CAN PERFORM THE RESPECTIVE DUTIES. TO THE BEST OF THEIR ABILITIES. MORE TO REMAIN. WITH THE NOTE THIS BILL ALLOWS. AN OFFICER'S WHO ARE MEMBERS OF TACTICAL TEAMS SUCH AS SWAT OR SPECIAL OPERATIONS TO CONTINUE USING THEIR COME FLOOD UNIFORMS WHILE ENGAGE IN AND A TO SPONSORS FOR UP. THE PROVISIONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR- THANK YOU BOB. OTHER IDIOTS.

ALL OF US RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE S. B. TWO OH THREE AS THE JUVENILE SEXUAL ASSAULT EIGHTY A FOUR INCH COUNTY IT IS PART OF MY TO BE THE DESIGNATED EXPERT ON EVEN MORE RANDOM LOS ANTIBIOTIC COUNTY WHY TRADING ON THE ISSUE. YOU SHOULD ALSO KNOW THAT I ONE EIGHT. THE FOR YEARS IN ORANGE COUNTY FIVE OF WHICH I WORKED IN DEPENDENCY TO REUNIFY FAMILIES. AS A MINORITY MOTHER TO AN AUTISTIC CHILD I AM VERY SENSITIVE TO HOW VULNERABLE OUR CHILDREN CAN BE TO MANIPULATION HARASSMENT AS WELL AS THE BEES AND VICTIMIZATION. AND AS AN IMMIGRANT FROM HONG KONG A PLACE WHERE DEMOCRACY IS WANING BY THE DAY I. HAVE THE UTMOST RESPECT FOR PERSONAL CIVIL LIBERTIES. PROFESSIONAL PERSONAL BACKGROUND LET ME SEE THAT SB TWO OR THREE IS UNNECESSARY IT OVER REACHES BEYOND JUST RAISING THE TARGET AGE AND WILL HAVE LASTING NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON JUVENILE JUSTICE REFORM. FIRST OF THE UNINTENDED EFFECT IS THE RATIFICATION OF BUILT IN SAFEGUARDS THE CURRENT JUVENILE MARANDA LAW ON THE- AMONG DISCIPLINARY. OF EXPERTS AS WELL AS COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVES TO CONVENE AND REVIEW JUST HOW EFFECTIVE THE LAW IT IS THE BILL TEN WHAT TO ENSURE ENGAGED AND FOR MINORITY LEADERS AND TO ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC CONCERNS OF GOVERNOR OUT OF WHEN HE WROTE HIS VETO MAY.

IS THAT SB TWO OH THREE MANDATE A COURT SHALL CONSIDER A VIOLATION OF IT AND CHARACTER EVIDENCE AGAINST THE POLICE OFFICER. THIS MEANS AS LONG AS THAT OFFICER IS WORKING THE YOUTH WILL BE CALLED REPEATEDLY TO TESTIFY ABOUT THIS POSSIBLE VIOLATION OF THEIR RIGHTS IN THEIR PAST.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU MAKE IT FAST THANK YOU. WE JUST. WE'VE BEEN HEARING I CAN GIVE YOU THE SPECIFICS BUT I DON'T I DON'T NEED TO DEALING WITH THE EXTRAORDINARY BACKLOG IN THE COURTS. BECAUSE THE COLD IT NOT JUST THE PEOPLE BEING ARRESTED FROM THE PROTESTS BUT ALSO JUST GENERALLY AND SO THIS THIS IDEA CAME TO ME ACTUALLY FROM THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE IN SAN FRANCISCO IN A COALITION IN ADDITION TO THOSE RECORDS THE- SOCIAIS SHOULD A PUBLIC DEFENDERS IN THE ACLU. AND I JUMPED ON IT BECAUSE- YOU KNOW WE HAVE REALLY BEEN GRAPPLING WITH THIS COURT FUNDING MANAGEMENT PROCESS FOR A LONG TIME. TWENTY FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS SIT IN YOUR CHAIR VENTURE- CHAIRMAN- WE HAD THE UNBELIEVABLE YOU KNOW WE ADOPTED ACTUALLY THE TRIAL COURT FUNDING ACT OF NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN WE'VE GONE UP AND DOWN AND IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT AS WE TRY TO MANAGE THE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. AND ALL THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IN THE DOWNTURN OF ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN THE- IT DID YOU DO BRANCH. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. SO HERE WE ARE TRYING TO.

COME UP WITH SOME THOUGHTFUL APPROACH WHERE THEY USE YOU KNOW A FEW YEARS YOU KEEP YOUR NOSE CLEAN SO TO SPEAK YOU DON'T GET IN TROUBLE FOR SIX MONTHS.

CAN HAVE BEEN WITH PLAYED ORDER THAT. OF ALL JUSTICE PART. THIS BILL THE OFFERS ON ACCOUNT. NO OVER. PASSED THOSE CHARGED WITH THEM WHY RANGE CLIENTS SHE BECAUSE THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS BEEN JUST READ THROUGH NO FAULT OF THE TONE AND THE DELIVERY PROCESS THESE CASE. UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL THE CRIMES INCLUDED IN THE SWEEPING PAST ARE SUCH SERIOUS VIOLENT FELONIES A SOLICITATION FOR MURDER HATE CRIMES AND MAJOR FOR. MISSING IT SO POLIO A COMPLETELY ORDER PASSAGE OF TIME IN SOME CASES YEARS AHEAD OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS THE NUYS VICTIMS ARE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO CONFER WITH THE PROSECUTION. AND TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD BY THE COURT THE BILL IS ALSO DISTURBINGLY SILENT ON WHETHER A DEFENDANT CAN CREATE. THE SIX MONTH PERIOD BY SPEAKING TO CONTINUE A CASE. CLEARLY INDEPENDENT SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO KICKED THE CASE DOWN THE ROAD IN ORDER TO AVAIL HIMSELF OR HERSELF. REALLY THE BILL. WE JUST GOOD TO CENTER HERTZBERG STAFF THAT CDA WOULD REMOVE ITS OPPOSITION YEP THE COKE NINETEEN ALTERNATIVE EDUCATION PROGRAM WAS LIMITED TO MISDEMEANORS WERE SPECIFIED EXCLUSIONS INCLUDING DELIGHTS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND- DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SEX OFFENCES. AND CLEARING ON IN THE WEST BANK WHICH WAS ADOPTED TO PREVENT A DEPENDENT FROM MANUFACTURING TO CONTINUE WANTS TO QUALIFY FOR THE DUPES DISMISSAL. WE HOPE TO CONTINUE THAT CUSTOMER RECORDS BURKE YEAH WHAT. BILLS BY THE- SOUTH OF HELP FOR HIS.

PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. I WILL GO TO NUMBER FORTY FIVE OF FORTY FIVE PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI THIS IS ANNA KELLY ON BEHALF OF THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WORK CURRENTLY IN OPPOSITION AS WELL WE HAVE HAD SOME CONSTRUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE AND HOPE TO CONTINUE TO DO SO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ONCE AGAIN AFTER ON THE PHONES IN LIKE TO VOICE OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. AT THIS TIME THERE ARE NO FURTHER IN THE QUEUE PLEASE CONTINUE MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU ARE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MISTER BARKHANE. WE I HAVE WELL THANK YOU SENATOR FOR BEING HERE AND I HAVE TO COMMEND YOU FOR SEEING A PRO BRINGING A BILL TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM IN MY DISCUSSIONS AROUND THIS BILL IT WAS PRESENTED AS ONE THAT ALLOWS FOR JUDICIAL DISCRETION I'M NOT SURE I READ THE BILL THAT WAY SO I WANNA. VERIFIES SO IT ALLOWS FOR A JUDGE TO- NOT. AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THIS PROCESS IF THERE'S AN UNREASONABLE RISK OF DANGER TO PUBLIC SAFETY WHICH IS DEFINED AS- AND REGIONAL WEST OF THE PETITIONER WILL COMMIT A NEW VIOLENT FELONY. NOW IF THE JUDGE FINDS THAT'S THEN THE INDIVIDUALS NOT ELIGIBLE. FOR THIS PROGRAM IF YOU WELL. BUT THAT SEEMS TO BE THE SOLE. DISCRETION UNDER THE BILL THE BILL SAYS THAT THE JUDGE SHALL DISMISS THE CASE SO AS LONG AS THE CRITERIA IT HERE MATT THE JUDGE DOESN'T HAVE DISCRETION IN THAT THAT DISCUSSION SEEMS TO BE FAIRLY LIMITED. CAN YOU. RESPOND TO THAT YEAH I THINK THAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IT'S A DELICATE BALANCE I CAN THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT LOOK. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT'S INTELLIGENT HERE GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES RIGHT THIS IS A PERFECT FIT SECTION SHALL NOT APPLY. RETROACTIVELY ANY CHARGERS ALL BY CONVICTION PRIOR TO JANUARY NE TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND IT IS EFFECTIVE ONLY UNTIL JERRY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO ZERO SHORT WINDOW. AND YES THE JUDGE HAS DISCRETION BUT THERE'S NO DETERMINATION OF WHAT THAT IS IF THE JUDGE IF SOMEBODY'S REARRESTED IT DOESN'T APPLY SOMEONE'S IN CUSTODY IT DOESN'T APPLY. JUST UP WITH THAT WAS MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE CRIME VICTIMS. PRESENTED TO THE JUDGE. OF COURSE AND THAT'S WHAT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IS FOUR TWO RIGHT IT IS A SERIES OF LAWS AND RULES SURROUNDING THE JUDGES AND WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. AND WE'VE SET. THE AGREEMENTS THAT WERE MADE WE'VE GOT A HOPE WE'VE LISTED IT UNBELIEVABLY LONG LIST OF EXCLUDED OFFENSES. IF YOU'RE IN CUSTODY IT DOESN'T APPLY. TO THE I THINK THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT IN TOTALITY ENTERTAINS OF HOW IT OPERATES. I THINK IT MAKES SENSE- BECAUSE WE TRY TO GET PEOPLE WHO. ARE REAL PROBLEMS AND HEART COMMITTING PROBLEMS IN SOCIETY AND- THE OTHERS. PRESSTITUTE THE LIKE THOSE THINGS CAN BE TAKEN CARE OF THE- DISTRICT ATTORNEY SUPPOSED TO NOTIFY. WHAT TO DO. THE SHIP GOES ON THE GIVING THAT JUST YEAH THE PROJECT MAKE A FINDING THAT NOT IT DOESN'T APPLY SO I THINK IF AND WHEN SAID COURT MAY DISMISS I WOULD FEEL LIKE THERE'S MORE TO XIN. DISMISSED TO ME IT IS THESE. AFTER THAT. THAT'S MY RE OF THE BILL SO GUESS ARE YOU A TO ON LIKE IF I HERE FROM YOU AND I WAS HERE THIS IS A FREE PRIOR TO DOING THAT THE IDEA HERE SHE'S. I DON'T THAT INTO WHICH GET BECAUSE MY CONCERN. THERE I'M HAPPY. THAT NOT THAT YOU'D LIKE GOOD YEAH PLEASE I GET THE IDEA OF A WITH. YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER SO YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT THAT IF CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE SATISFIED. THE AD JUDGE'S DISCRETION IS LIMITED STATE SITUATION WHERE THE DEFENDANTS LIKELY TO COMMIT A VIOLENT OFFENSE. HOWEVER ONE OF THOSE CONDITIONS ONE OF THE PRE REQUISITE CONDITION IS THAT THE JUDGE HAS ALREADY ACTORS. HIS OR HER DISCRETION TO RELEASE THAT PERSON. IN OTHER WORDS. BUT AT THE THANK YOU READ ANYWAY SHAPE OR FORM AND HAS DECLINED TO RELEASE THE PURSE WON'T BE OUT AND THEREFORE WON'T QUALIFY THE BILL. MY SCRATCHING THEY DON'T GET AND IF THE STRIKE ABOUT BETWEEN FOR TRYING TO CAPTURE THAT THE HIGH END CASES. WHILE AND ALLOW TO HELP GOOD GRIEF ITS PRIORITIES AWAY FROM WHAT. AND THAT. LET ME ASK ALSO IT WOULD DOES NOT DIRECTLY RELATED BUT YOUR QUESTION INFORMS THE LAST FIVE YEARS OF MY LIFE IN DETERMINING. NOW THE ROLE THE JUDICIAL BRANCH AND SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IN THE PROVINCIAL BRANCH I'VE CERTAINLY FACE THAT THE BAIL ARGUMENT. AS TO WHETHER THE JUDGES WAX. QUESTION OR WHETHER THEY'LL JUST PUT UP A BALLOT SOME. AND THIS WHOLE DYNAMIC ABOUT JUDGES. AT ITS HEART QUESTION I'M NOT SUGGESTING IT IS IT AND WE MADE THAT THE SHALL. WE WANT WE DON'T JUDGE IS JUST TO WORK OUT OF YOUR CALL IF THEY DID THIS RIGHT. MY GOD SOME. ONE OF THE STATE REACHED STEP ANDERS IF YOU HADN'T COMMITTED CRIME THERE WAS NO OVER FIND WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AT THE END THEY- COMES UP AND SAYS HEY HERE'S A PROBLEM IT'S GOING TO. YOU'RE PROBABLY PRETTY MUCH. GREAT IS THERE TO THE DID THIS PROGRAM ON APPLY. BUT TO TRY TO MAKE IT MANAGEABLE AND- PART ONCE YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE'VE GOT THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT WE TRUST THE JUDICIAL BUT WE DON'T REALLY TRUSTED. IN AWE I HAVE GREAT REGARD FOR IT BUT IT'S HARD RIGHT AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO MEET THE BALANCES WE ARE TRYING TO DO THIS NEAR THE BAY. AND FIGURE A- SO. YOU KNOW. ALL RIGHT GREEN GAINES RESTRAINT ORDER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SPOUSAL RAPE STALKING FELONS THE WISE ELDER ABUSE CHILD ABUSE LONG LIST OF ALL THE THOSE THAT CODE SECTION'S VIEW WE REFERENCE. THE BILL SO WE'VE BEEN PRETTY THOROUGH AND THAT STARTED WHERE THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL STARTED ON THE COLBERT EXCLUSIONS IN WHAT THEY WERE TRYING TO DO. SO IT'S A ONE YEAR PROGRAM. IF WE ARE SIGNIFICANT BORDERS AROUND TO TRY TO MAKE IT WORK- THE PEOPLE THAT CAME TO ME WITH THIS ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE COURTROOMS EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND I AM THE AVERAGE YOU KNOW PRETTY GOOD DISCOUNT. I THINK IS A CITED BY THE MIDDLE SENSE GIVEN THE CHALLENGES WE- FACEBOOK SO BY. AM VERY. DOESN'T LIKE IT SORRY MISTER MORRIS MY FRIEND FOR A LOT OF YEARS. BUT I THINK IT MEETS BALLOTS THAT THAT IS A RELATIVELY INTELLIGENT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO UNDER THESE VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES. WHAT DO YOU. BRING FIFTY THOUGHT. HOW DO YOU MEET THOSE BACK. HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE PROTECTING PUBLIC SAFETY. AND YET STILL HAVE JUDICIAL BRANCH THAT OPERATES YOU KNOW SO IT'S SO. IT'S BEEN VERY CHALLENGING BUT I THINK THE ALLERGIST. THANK YOU FOR ELECTING. WELL I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN BUT THERE'S A SONG ABOUT THAT. YEAH RIGHT NOW OF THE TRAGIC SONG IN MY OPINION ON THIS WHOLE. CONSIDERATION I YOU KNOW I HAVE DEEP RESPECT FOR YOU. MY HEAVENS THIS SEEMS LIKE WHEN YOU USE THE WORD BALANCE CERTAINLY IN THAT BALLOT YOU CAN'T. SOME OF THE STREET FACING VICTIMS IN THIS PROPOSAL BUT BECAUSE I HAD RESIDENTS JUST LIKE YOU'LL PLEASE I DO YEAH BECAUSE- THE CONSTITUTION THE TUITION AS WAS SUGGESTED BY THE OPPOSITION'S ARTICLE ONE SUBSET OF THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION. TALKS ABOUT VICTIMS RIGHTS SECTION THREE SECTION THREE B. I. BONTA THOSE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS THERE IS NOTHING HERE THAT PROHIBITS VICTIMS RIGHTS THE WAY THE PROCESS IS YOU KNOW FOR YOUR PREVIOUS LIFE IS THAT THE DEBT ATTORNEY FORM. AND THEN IT THEY SHIP EVERY RIGHT TO BE HEARD THERE IS. ISSUE HERE THAT VIOLATES RIGHTS IT DOESN'T CALL THEM OUT BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO CALL OUT FREE SPEECH EQUAL PARTS OF THE LAW AT ALL FRAMEWORKS THAT. HOUSTON EVERY LOSS OF LIFE BY. SO THEY HAVE TO BE NOTIFIED IF ANYBODY'S NOTIFIED THE CONSTITUTION APPLIES THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY NOTIFIED US THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHTS THERE IS NO LIMITATION HOWEVER. I WOULD BE THAT THE FURTHERANCE OF JUSTICE ISN'T IT IN VICTIMS RIGHT AND THIS IS NOT BEEN NO WAY REPRESENTS THE PREFERRED TO JUST JUST THING AND- THAT IS. NOT BEEN DECATUR AND BEING SUMMARILY DISMISSED BECAUSE OF OVERCROWDING. THAT TO ME IS A BUT DISMISSAL OF THE BALANCE THAT- SHOULD TAKE PLACE IN JUSTICE AND- THERE'S JUST A- FOR EXAMPLE I MEAN THIS UNREASONABLE RISK TO PUBLIC SAFETY SOME STATUTES THAT ARE REFERRED TO SPECIFIC. QUALIFIES THAT DEFINITION IS NOT AS BROAD AS- AS IF YOU'RE MAKING IT SOUND IN MY OPINION BASED ON WHAT I'VE BEEN TOLD. YEAH THIS IS JUST VERY VERY SCARY TO ME THAT SEEMS TO BE A DIRECT ASSAULT AGAINST THE PUBLIC SAFETY ASPECT CERTAINLY SIR. IT'S A STRONG CONSIDERATION ON RELIEVING THE COURTS OF THEIR BACKLOG I SEE THAT BENEFIT. AND I DON'T SEE THE BENEFIT AS FAR AS GIVEN SOMEBODYA FREE PASS BECAUSE WERE OVERCROWDED AYE AYE. YEAH I'M I'M VERY VERY SORRY THAT THIS IS. A GOOD CHANCE OF PASSING. ALL OF MY CLOTHES MISTER CHAIRMAN YES. WHICH COME UNDER THE THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I- UNDERSTAND THE REASONING FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD BECAUSE OF A CORONA VIRUS. BUT I WOULD ACTUALLY ARGUE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT EVEN BEFORE THE- I KNOW. ABOUT IN BELL IN- YOUR STATEMENTS. THAT THIS WILL HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE BACKLOG THAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR COURTS AS ROADS ARE TO AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC. BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S RESTING PLUGGING OF POOR. THE REST OF THE DAY MAY BE BECAUSE OF HOW WE USE THE COURTS AT OPPORTUNITY IN A SENSE TO KIND OF. TRY. I NECESSARY. STOPPABLE CHARGES USING THE SYSTEM TO FIGURE OUT ALL OF THE DIFFERENT MOVERS THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED TO EIGHT HAVE MORE WILL GO TO COURT SINCE WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S PLOY. AND REVENUE GENERATING SYSTEM AND ALSO TO GIVE IN MY OPINION AND I KNOW THIS IS BIASED DISTRICT ATTORNEYS NUMEROUS BITES AT THE APPLE WHEN IT'S ABOUT TRYING TO CHARGE AND PROSECUTE- WELL I ACTUALLY THINK THAT THIS IS. A GOOD. OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO FIX OUT HOW WE CAN CREATE GREATER EFFICIENCY IN COURT SYSTEM. I HAVE BEEN WITH NEW PEOPLE WHO ARM THEMSELVES IN THE CAR EVERYTHING DAY AND HAVE ALSO HAD TO DURING THE PANDEMIC. THEY TAUGHT ABOUT. THREE THESE ARE THE FIRST HAS BEEN A LIMB FROM THE PROCESS THESE THEY'RE INVOLVED IN BAILIFFS CLERKS JUDGES DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND DEFENSE COUNSEL ARE READING WHAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE- DELIVERING ARE MUCH MORE. THIRD BECAUSE NOT TIME BASED BECAUSE LIVES ARE AT STAKE AND IT'S AMAZING THAT THIS KIND NATIONAL PANDEMIC HAS BEEN NOTHING TO ENCOURAGE THE COURTS TO GET MORE OF FICTION AND THOUGHTFUL ABOUT HOW THE SYSTEM IS USED I THINK BECAUSE THEY WANT TO PUT THE SPEECH WHAT. A SYSTEM BUT AS I WROTE. ACTUALLY YOU JUST FACT ONE DEFENDANTS WRITTEN IF THEY ARE A CO BY CHARGED THANKS. AND SO I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY WHERE WE SHOULD BE GULLWING WITH HOW WE'RE TRYING TO REIMAGINE JUDICIAL OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND I AM IDO YOU FOR TAKING THE FUN YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT. ON TOP OF ME PULSE. BALLADEER'S INTO YOUR POINT THEY- BECAUSE THEY ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE SWEAT AS OF THE POLITICAL AND CULTURAL WHIMS AND THAT IS NOT WHAT SHOULD BE USED WHEN YOU ARE DELIBERATING SOMEONE'S FREEDOM AND CIVIL LIBERTIES SO I STAY ALL SAY THAT IS THE ARE WE SUPPORT THIS OFF AND I. THEREFORE THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY BURKE ECONOMIST COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU MAY CLOSE MISTER THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THE INSIGHT I LOOK. I WANT TO ADDRESS ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY'S COMMENTS IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE- I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. BUT WHEN YOU WERE JUSTICE. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE TOTALITY OF THE EXPERIENCE FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END. AND WE HAVE A WHOLE HOST OF PUTTING CONSTITUTIONAL CONSTRUCTS. ABOUT THE PEOPLE ABOUT ENSURING JUSTICE AND FAIRNESS ABOUT SPEEDY TRIALS. AND ALL OF THE THINGS. AND SO HERE WE ARE FROM THE PROFESSIONALS IN THE COURT ROOM- MY CONSULTED EITHER. THIS LEAVE MYSELF WITH RIGHT I JUST JUMPED UP. YEAH WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW IT'S CRAFTED RIGHT GIVEN WHAT THE PRACTICAL REALITIES ARE WHAT'S THE HARM TO PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE STILL SITTING AROUND WHAT IMPACT ON THEIR LIVES I DID HE HEAR IT SOMEBODY NOT. SAFETY VALVE IN CASE THERE'S A PROBLEM IN THE EVENT THAT SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN IN CUSTODY THEY'RE NOT QUALIFIED. CLEARLY VICTIM RIGHTS ARE BACK TO THE CONSTITUTION IS NOW IN POSITION THERE WE ADELINE HUJAN CONCERNING RESTITUTION OF SOMEBODY BUSTED SOMEBODY'S WINDOW OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE TO MAKE SURE. THAT'S IN FAIRNESS TO THE VICTIM AS- AND SO I DON'T DISAGREE IT'S NOT PERFECT. BUT WE ARE IN THE MOST DIFFICULT OF TIMES WHERE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO ADMINISTER JUSTICE. ON THE COURT CIRCUMSTANCES AS WAS AS WAS ARTICULATED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER COM OR- SO WHAT DO WE DO THAT CREATES THE MOST BENEFIT TO THE MOST PEOPLE. AN PROVIDE PUBLIC SAFETY. AND ALL OF THE OTHER BALANCING ACTS THAT WE HAVE TO DO AND I DO THINK THAT THIS IS A BALANCE AND THOUGHTFUL APPROACH I'M NOT SUGGESTING IT'S EASY. I'M NOT SUGGESTING IT IS IN A WAY THAT COULD BE THE CREDIBILITY CAN BE ATTACKED ONE FORMER ANOTHER. BUT I THINK I POSSIBILITY IN THIS JOB IS LAWMAKERS IS TO MAKE THE TOUGH CHOICES AND I THINK THAT THIS DOES MAKE THE TOUGH CHOICE ARE- AND FOR THAT I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. SUCH THANK YOU. SHARES AND I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE TALKING TO THE DA'S- WOULD LOVE TO BE A FLY ON THE WALL WHEN YOU AND MISTER MORRIS. GO AHEAD- TO TRY TO MAYBE COME UP WITH SOME SOLUTIONS THAT WILL SATISFY BOTH BY THE BODIES BUT I THINK THAT. WOULD BE A VERY LONG DISCUSSION. AND PROBABLY TAKE SEVERAL DAYS BUT I AM COURAGE THAT THERE AT LEAST SOME SOME OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE DIALOGUE AND IF YOU'RE WILLING TO HAVE THAT SITUATION RECOMMENDING. AND I SO THAT WE- WE COULD. CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS. IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED. MANCHESTER YOU MAY CALL THE ROLL. ON SB THREE FIFTEEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER IRAQI.

YOU GOT TO REMEMBER. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IT GETS QUITE CHAOTIC. AND PEOPLE WILL MAKE A LOT OF CLAIMS AND ESPECIALLY NOW WITH WHEN EVERYBODY HAS A CAMERA IT BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT AND SO. I WOULD JUST ASK YOU RESPECT. HOW WE'RE JUST TRYING TO WHAT WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS THAT DUTY THAT THEY WANT TO BE COMPLIANT THEY WANT TO BE PROFESSIONAL. BUT SOMETIMES A DAVID AND- SOMETIMES IT LOOKS WAY WORSE THAN IT REALLY IS ANYWAYS. SECOND PIECE WOULD BE THE COMMAND POST RESTRICTION THE TO GIVE THAT STRONG CONSIDERATION BECAUSE THAT IS. PUBLIC SAFETY COULD BE COMPROMISED THERE AND I DON'T THINK THAT YOUR INTENT SO- I'M GOING LEFT AND IF YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH GROUPS. YOU'LL YOU'LL GET ME UP FOR. THANK YOU THANK YOU.

RIGHT FOR THE QUESTIONS WITH A VERY FEATURE YES. THE MUCH THE FIRST OF ALL I THIS IS FINISH. THAT WE'VE BEEN REALLY WORK ON. ACCESS TO THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL'S IDENTICAL TO EXISTING AUTHORITY- THAT WE HAVE PROVIDED PRESS FOR OTHER INCIDENCES. DURING ACTORS WE LITERALLY DID THIS FROM A SECTION. WHILE AREAS THAT ARE GOING BE CLOSE THE AT THOSE AFTER DISASTERS MEMBERS OF THE PRESS ARE AUTHORIZED ENTRANTS. ON THESE DISASTERS HERE NIGHT EVEN DURING TIMES OF CURFEW. STILL ON THE ISSUE OF THE- OF THE COMMAND POST IN THIS IS BEEN AN ISSUE THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON. FUND IS WELL REALLY TRYING TO- SEE THERE'S A ABILITY TO COMPROMISE. FIRST AND FOREMOST THERE IS NO EXPECTATION WHEN EITHER OF US ARE ON TIS DIET FOR MYSELF WE'RE WALKING FOR EXAMPLE TO A POLICE DEPARTMENT OR A MEMBER OF THE PRESS FOR THAT. MATTER WALKS INTO A LOBBY THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IN DEMANDS ACCESS TO THE EVIDENCE ROOM OR TWO CUBICLES WERE OFFICES OR CITY. AND BE GRANTED THAT ACCESS. IT WOULD BE SAID FOR COMMAND CODE THAT OUR FIRST AMENDMENT- EVENT. I'M WE WOULDN'T BE GIVEN UNFETTERED ACCESS WHETHER IT'S A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC OR PRESS AND I THINK THAT THE SAME ASSUMPTION WILL HAPPEN HERE WHEN IT COMES ON THE- COMMAND POST. THE RIVER THE MAX THE PRESS ALREADY. UNDER NOW. MISTER REPLY TO THIS BILL ON THE DOOLEY AUTHORIZED. IN JUST THIS IS BEEN A BIT OF A STICKY WICKET IF I COULD BE CANDID- EXIST. ALREADY STATE JULIA REYES NUMBERS CAN HAVE ACCESS TO CLOSE AREAS. BUT HERE'S THE CHALLENGE REGARDS THE DULY ACCESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO THE BOTTOM LINE DEFINITION IS BROAD AND HAS DROPPED. BECAUSE OF THE CAR ANYTHING. BURKE IN BRAD IS TO PROTECT OUR THAT FIRST IN FREE OF THE PRESS YEAH THERE'S BEEN A TEN THROUGH YEARS AND GOD BLESS THE CHP BY THE WAY BECAUSE THEY HAVE TRIED TO. ZERO THIS ISSUE OF CREDENTIALING- IN IT EACH ATTEMPT HAS FAILED NOW THIS BILL COMES ALONG AND ACTUALLY TIGHTENS UP THE DEFINITION. OF ST PRESS MUST HAVE CREDENTIALS THE FIRST IS WHAT THE STATUTE IN AND WE DO DEFY PROFESSIONAL BROADCASTING EQUIPMENT A REPORT RECORD. DEVICE MICROPHONE CAN EXCEPT FOR A WITHIN THE BILL BUT HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE AND ALL IN IT RIGHT HERE IN RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I THE CHALLENGES WE NOW A FEW OF THOSE FEET. YAHOO NEWS BOX ALL ON. IS IN THE COUNTRY IS INTENTIONALLY BROAD RIGHTFULLY SO TO ENSURE THAT THOSE MEMBERS OF THE PRESS- HAVE ACCESS THAT TOO WHETHER IT'S AN APP IS ASTRID THIS BILL FIRST AND IN THE EVENT.

HOW YOU. BEING DECIMATED DECADES WITH OF ALL THE TIME SO WHEN THEY SHOWED UP ON THE SCENE. YOU KNEW WHO THE WHO HE OR SHE WAS A GOOD TEAM. TOGETHER MAYBE FOR SEVERAL DECADES IT'S SO YOU COULD TALK TO ALL THE RULES AND REGULATIONS. IS IT NOW TALK TO A YOUNGEROFFICER WERE IT HAS EXPLODED AS FAR AS THE NUMBER OF MEDIA OUTLETS. THAT ARE OUT THERE AND SO I WHILE THE CONSTITUTION MAY SAYS SOMETHING IN A CERTAIN DEDICATED TIME. IT MAY NOT BE. APROPOS AS MUCH AS NOW AND- OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T CHANGE THE CONSTITUTION BUT WE SHOULD. JUST SOME OF OUR THINKING TO THE EXPLOSION OF CHANNEL SO IT TOO IS BUT YOU GET FIVE THOUSAND CHANNELS RIGHT NOW TO. HOW I'M GOING TO HAVE ANY MEDIA OUT. THERE ARE JUST PEOPLE ABOUT- WON'T EVEN GET.

ALL RIGHT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY WITH FS THAT'S GOOD BUT THIS ONE. YOUR HEAD I DON'T WANT TO SCREW IT UP. BUT LET ME LET ME JUST BRIEFLY EXPLAIN THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL SB TWELVE TWENTY DEALS WITH AN ISSUE CALLED THE BRADY LIST I THINK MOST IF NOT ALL OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH. THE OBLIGATION IMPOSED BY BRADY VERSUS MARYLAND THAT A PROSECUTOR MUST DISCLOSE THE DEFENSE ANY EXCULPATORY INFORMATION THAT WOULD INCLUDE- INFORMATION THAT MAY BE IN THE TESTIFYING OFFICERS FILE CONSERVE MISCONDUCT THERE ARE A VARIETY OF OTHER ISSUES. SADLY SOME LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE NOT COMPLETELY COMPLYING WITH IN THE STATE THIS REQUIRES THEM TO DO SO TO PROVIDE THAT LIST UPON REQUEST OR ANNUALLY TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY THE PROSECUTING AGENCY- THE FAIR TO DO SO MEANS THAT. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION DEFENSE COUNSEL DOES HAVE INFORMATION TO EXAMINE THE OFFICER AND CAN ULTIMATELY RESULT IN A REVERSAL OF A CONVICTION OR EVEN AND SOMEONE GOING TO PRISON WHO SHOULDN'T GO TO PRISON. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL TRIES TO ADDRESS THE SECOND PART OF THE BILL. IS IT PROVIDES A MINIMAL AMOUNT OF DUE PROCESS TO AN OFFICER WHO IS GOING TO BE ON THE BRADY LIST. THAT DUE PROCESS MEANS THAT THEY'RE NOTIFIED THEY'RE GOING TO BE ON THE BRADY LIST OR THAT THEY'RE ON THE BRADY LIST. AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY ABOUT BEING REMOVED HOWEVER IT DOES NOT REMOVE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OBLIGATION TO. NOTIFY THE DEFENSE COUNSEL THAT SOMEONE IS ON THE BRADY LIST IT DOES NOT DELAY TRIAL. IN IN FACT IN ALAMEDA. SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY THIS IS THE PROCESS THE RATHER COUNT AS WELL GOOD IN VENTURA COUNTY.

GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS MARCO GEORGE FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION WE APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE AMENDMENTS THAT HE HAS TAKEN THANKFULLY WE CAN CONTINUE THE DISCUSSIONS BUT AT THIS POINT WE OPPOSED PROFESSOR ABLE WILL EXPLAIN THE PROBLEMS WITH F. B. TWELVE TWENTY PROFESSOR JONATHAN ABLE OF UC HASTINGS HAS RESEARCHED AN WRITTEN EXTENSIVELY ABOUT BRADY'S APPLICATION TO POLICE MISCONDUCT RECORDS. INCLUDING A NATIONWIDE STUDY PUBLISHED IN THE STANFORD LAW REVIEW HE HAS ALSO SERVED AS COUNSEL FOR ME BECAUSE LAW PROFESSORS AND THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT MOST RECENT BRADY VERSUS PITCHES CASE A LADS VERSUS COURT THANK YOU. THANK YOU IT HELLO THIS IS JONATHAN ABLE I WANT TO START BY THANKING YOU VERY MUCH FOR CONSIDERING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. THE COMMITTEE DESERVES A LOT OF CREDIT FOR TAKING BRADY SO SERIOUSLY. BUT THIS BILL IS DEEPLY FLAWED. IT'S NOT JUST A MISSED OPPORTUNITY IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO MAKE THINGS WORSE. THE BASIC PROBLEM. IS THAT THE PREVIOUS. BILL IS MUCH NARROWER MUCH NARROWER THAN WHAT BRADY REQUIRES. IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE IT A FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL LAW LIKE BRADY INTO A STATUTE. YEP MAKE SURE THE STATUTE SWEEPS AT LEAST AS BROADLY AS BRADY. THE PREVIOUS HERE FELT THAT PASSED. HERE A FEW EXAMPLES OF CONDUCT IT SHOULD LAND AN OFFICER. ON A REAL BRIEF THE LAST. BUT NOT THE LIST TO FIND IN THIS BILL. FOR EXAMPLE AN OFFICER TESTIFIED THAT A SUPPRESSION HEARING. THE JUDGE FINDS THE OFFICER LIED AND TO SUPPRESS THAT THE EVIDENCE. THAT SHOULD PUT THE OFFICER ON THE BRADY LIST BUT IT WOULDN'T IN THE WAY% THE BREEDING AT IS DEFINED. IN MIGHT FIND OFFICER LIABLE. FOR VIOLATING SOMEONE'S CIVIL RIGHTS BY FABRICATING EVIDENCE. FOR A PROSECUTOR DURING TRIAL PRESS MIGHT DETERMINE THAT AN OFFICER IS NOT TELLING THE TRUTH AND DECIDE NOT TO CALL THE OFFICER AS A WITNESS. IN THESE INSTANCES THE OFFICERS CONDUCT SHOULD WIN THE OFFICER ON A PREVIOUS. BUT A PROSECUTOR FOLLOWING YOUR BILL DEFINITION OF THE PREVIOUS WITH MISTY AND OTHER EXAMPLES OF READING MATERIAL. THE BILL CONTAINS SOME OTHER WORRISOME CARGO. BREEDING MUST BE TURNED OVER CONTINUOUSLY BUT YOUR BILL ALLOWED JUST YEARLY UPDATE. THE PROCESS FOR NOTIFYING OFFICERS AND ALLOWING THEM TO APPEAL PRETTY DETERMINATION. IF THAT AT ALL INTERFERES WITH THE PROSECUTOR'S JUDGMENT ABOUT WHO SHOULD BE ON THE LIST WHAT THE F. I WOULD REDUCE WELL. IN AN OFFICER WHO LEADS THE DEPARTMENT. UNDER INVESTIGATION AND GOES TO ANOTHER DEPARTMENT. WOULD LIKELY BE ABLE TO EVADE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS MIGHT NOT APPEAR ON EITHER DEPARTMENTS FREEDOS. SO YEAH THERE ARE FLAWS IN YOU MAY BE THINKING WELL THE BILL BETTER THAN NOTHING. IN I REALLY WISH I COULD AGREE WITH THAT. BUT THE TROUBLE IS THERE'S BASICALLY NO BENEFIT TO A U. S. BASED ON THE MATERIAL DESCRIBED IN SUBDIVISION G. TO. BECAUSE THE CURRENT GET ACCESS TO ALL THAT INFORMATION ON THEIR OWN THROUGH PUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS FOR COURT SEARCHING. SO WHEN YOU HAVE SUCH A MARGINAL BENEFIT IN TERMS OF WHAT THE BRADY WHAT IS GOING ON COVER IF THE THINK ABOUT WHAT THE COSTS ARE AND- I THINK. THE PRESIDENTIAL ONE. AT FIRST WHAT WELL INTENTIONED PROSECUTORS WHO BASED THEIR RESPONDENTS DEFINITION IN THIS BILL WILL END UP VIOLATING BRADY BECAUSE OF. THE BILL'S NARROW DEFINITION OF WHAT COUNTS. BORING ON THE BRIDGE LIST. IN THERE'S THE ADDITIONAL ISSUE THAT ANY PROSECUTOR WHO IS NOW FOLLOWING BRADY BY LOOKING AT THE FULL RANGE OF MISCONDUCT MATERIAL YOU KNOW BEYOND WHAT THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE. WELL THAT PROSECUTOR IS IMMEDIATELY GOING TO FACE PRESSURE FROM POLICE UNIONS. WHO ARE GONNA SAY JUST STICK TO WHAT THE STATUTE REQUIRES THE GONNA. ATTACK THAT A PROSECUTOR BUT POLITICALLY- IN TERMS OF LITIGATION. M. THEN REALLY WORST OF ALL THERE ARE BAD ACTORSWHO WILL SUPPRESS READING MATERIAL AND HIDE BEHIND THE EXCUSE. THAT THEY'RE JUST FOLLOWING THE STATUTE. ON TOP OF ALL THIS. I THINK THIS BILL IS GOING TO KEY UP ABOUT HALF A DOZEN CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES AND IT WILL BE A REAL MESS. SO I DON'T WANT TO CLOSE I THINK THERE IS LEGISLATIVE ACTION THAT COULD IMPROVE PRETTY COMPLIANCE. I'M CONFIDENT YOU'RE GOING TO GET THERE. BUT FIRST YOU HAVE TO VOTE AGAINST THIS BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- ARE THERE. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IN THE HEARING ROOM. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION- VIA CONFERENCING. THAT NUMBER IS A MODERATOR COULD YOU DO TO DIAL IN OPPOSITION. THE LADIES ON THE PHONE LINES HERE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. THE END OF YOUR IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO WILL FIRST GO TO NUMBER TWO SIXTY PLEASE GO AHEAD. MISTER MISTER CHAIR- IF WE DO LOCATE- MISREPORTING THEN THE VIRTUAL UNIVERSE IF WE CAN HAVE HIM TESTIFY AS WELL THAT WOULD BE GREAT. RIGHT THANK YOU. ONCE AGAIN NUMBER NUMBER TWO FIFTY YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON TO MARK TOOK OUT ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN SUPPORT OF SB TWELVE TWENTY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. DOESN'T LOOK. NUMBER SEVEN FIVE FOOD ON THE FAMED. I THINK THE CREE HOURS. THE. THANK YOU YOUR NAME AND I'M GOING TO BE A WITNESS BUT HAVE TO WAIT FOR THEM TO GET TO THE BILL THEM. THIRTY FIVE ON THE ALBUM. HELLO NAME MMHM THIS IS S. B. TWELVE TWENTY- BURKE OUR UNIT RIGHT BILL. BUDGET WE'LL GO DO- NUMBER ONE EIGHTY FOUR PLEASE GO AHEAD. DANIEL GUTIERREZ ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE RESPECT WHEN OPPOSITION. WILL NOW GO TO NUMBER TWO SIXTY TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD. MY NAME IS MIGUEL LEYVA I'M WITH THAT B. C. C. N. I. SUPPORT BEGINS. FOUR NINE. BUT NEXT TO A NUMBER SEVENTY FIVE PLEASE GO AHEAD. DENIS CUEVAS ROMERO WHAT THEY FEEL YOU'LL CALIFORNIA REGRETTABLY OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED WE APPRECIATE AUTHORS WORK ON THE BILL BUT- BELIEVE THE BILL STILL NEEDS A LITTLE- SOMEWHERE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOGLE THE NUMBER THIRTY FOUR PLEASE GO AHEAD. BANNEKER DHARMA ON BEHALF OF THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE ALSO REGRETTABLY AND IN AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION AT AND ALSO HAPPY TO BE A PART OF FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ON THE BILL. THANK YOU. IT ONCE AGAIN IF YOU'RE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. AT THIS TIME WE HAVE NO FURTHER IN Q. PLEASE CONTINUE MISTER CHAIR. AND BRING IT WELL BEFORE WE BRING YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE IS. YOUR WITNESS. IT IS JUST SUBJECT LOCAL DIDN'T IT BODINE SAN FRANCISCO DA IS A- IS HE AVAILABLE. WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE- JUST BOOTING DIALED INTO THE CALL. SO ALL RIGHT BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS. MISS BAR KAY AND THEY MISSED THE COURT. WELL I PROBABLY WON'T DO JUSTICE WITH THE DA WOUD HAVE DONE BUT I'LL DO MY BEST I'M SO. I IN MY PRACTICE REPRESENTED A GENTLEMAN WHO WAS WRONGFULLY CONVICTED AND SPENT TEN YEARS ON DEATH ROW AS A RESULT OF A BRADY VIOLATION. DOCUMENTS THAT WERE AS ONE OF THE OPPOSITION WITNESSES MENTIONED. PURPOSELY WITHHELD BUT NONETHELESS WITH FROM MY CLIENT. AND WE WERE ABLE TO GET HIM OFF BUT HE NEVER GOT THOSE TEN YEARS OF HIS LIFE BACK AND SO I THINK THAT THAT SEEKS JUST TO WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS THE- THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO HAVE. THAT EXONERATING EVIDENCE AVAILABLE TO THE DEFENSE AND DEFENSE COUNSEL IN ORDER TO PUT ON THE BEST DEFENSE POSSIBLE WHICH IS REALLY THE FUNDAMENTAL. PROTECTIONS THAT ARE. SUPPOSED TO BE BUILT INTO OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND BY NO MEANS DO I READ THIS BILL AND I WOULD ASK IF YOU AGREE WITH ME TO LIMIT ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM THE RIGHTS GRANTED. MEDIA SUGGEST BY THE OPPOSITE GEN. BUT INSTEAD TO PUT FORTH A PROCEDURE THAT WILL HELP INSURE FOR THE DEFENDANTS GET. THAT MATERIAL BUT IF SOMETHING IS NOT. WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL BY NO MEANS DOES THAT MEAN NDA DOESN'T HAVE TO TURN IT OVER. DO YOU AGREE WITH ME. SO ASSEMBLY WOMAN ARE QUE HAND. APPRECIATE YOUR EXAMPLE THAT IS EXACTLY CORRECT THAT THAT. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT SOME SADLY SOME LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE NOT COMPLYING WITH THEIR BRADY REQUIREMENTS THIS CODIFIES IT. THIS LEAVES IT SHOULD LEAVE NO AMBIGUITY AS THE THEIR RESPONSIBILITY- LET ME RESPOND TO THE PROFESSORS WRONG HEADEDNESS- WITH RESPECT TO- FOR EXAMPLE HOW OFTEN. THE BRADY LIST NEEDS TO BE PRODUCED UPON REQUEST MUST BE PRODUCED AS WELL AS ANNUALLY IT'S NOT AN EITHER OR- SITUATION. IN TERMS OF WHAT MUST BE LISTED. IT IS ANY. ISSUE OF MORAL. IS DETERMINED BY AN APPELLATE COURT IN CALIFORNIA AND SO. IT IS IT IS QUITE BROAD. IT ALSO REQUIRES IF THERE'S A SUSTAIN FINDING OF GROUP BIAS. WHICH IS DIFFERENT SO THE EXAMPLE THAT I'VE USED IS THE MARK FUHRMAN EXAMPLE- IN THE OJ SIMPSON TRIAL WE'RE CLEARLY HE EXHIBITED. EVIDENCE OF GROUP BIAS WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN REVEALED TO THE DEFENSE AND THEY FOUND IT I THINK SERENDIPITOUSLY BUT MANY OF AND- SO THAT WOULD NOT WELL. IF COMPLIED WITH THAT SITUATION WOULDN'T EXIST. ALSO THIS SIMPLY CODIFIES THE PRACTICE OF ALAMEDA AND SAN FRANCISCO ANOTHER COUNTY VENTURA COUNTY THAT THAT'S EXISTED FOR SOME TIME SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES. THAT THAT BOAT HAS BEEN MISSED FOR A VERY LONG TIME WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS THIS PROVIDES EIGHT IN CODIFIES REQUIREMENTS TO MAKE SURE THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT YOU DESCRIBED. IF IT HAPPENS IT HAPPENS BECAUSE OF- SOMEONE A PROSECUTOR SALIH WHO WILLFULLY DISOBEYED THE LAW. MISTER CLARK GEN MISTER LUCKY. HELLO ONE CONCERN. WAS MOVED INTO THE OPPOSITION. EXOME IS THAT YOUR NOT FOLLOWING AND PROTECTIVE WITH THE YEAR LIMIT FOR THE CONDITIONS AS WELL WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT SO IT DOESN'T THE BRACE REQUIREMENT IF HIS ACCOUNT IS A CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT. BUT BUT IT IT IS A CONSTANT REQUIREMENT THAT. EVIDENCE THAT WOULD BE USED FOR EXAMPLE IN CROSS EXAMINATION B. B. TURNED OVER SO THERE IS MEAN THAT THIS IS AGAIN THE LONG STANDING POLICY OF A NUMBER OF DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICES THAT THAT HAS NOT BEEN CHALLENGE THAT HAS NOT BEEN SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGED. THERE ARE ISSUES WITH THE PITCHES MOTION SO. IF FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S AN OFFICER THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IS TOLD HAS POTENTIAL BRADY MATERIAL POTENTIAL- MISCONDUCT IN THEIR PERSONNEL FILE. THEN IT'S TURNED OVER THE DA THAN SIMPLY SAYS THE DEFENSE COUNSEL THERE'S SOME MATERIAL HERE THAT YOU MAY WANT TO- BE AWARE OF AND THEN A COURT. EXAMS IT AND INTERNS AT ALL EXCEPT DISTINCTION. BY THE WAY IF THERE IS SOMETHING QUITE EGREGIOUS IF THERE'S SOMETHING LIKE A FELONY CONVICTION FOR PERJURY THAT FIVE YEAR LIMIT IS NOT A LIMITATION ON THEIR OBLIGATION. CLAIMING THE WORLD WILL HAVE MOVEMENT-O'DONNELL YEAH. HELLO THE IT IT IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T- IT IT IT REQUIRES THAT WITHIN THAT FIVE YEAR PERIOD SUSTAINED FINDINGS OF MISCONDUCT FOR EXAMPLE THAT MIGHT NOT RESULT IN A CRIMINAL CONVICTION MUST BE TURNED OVER BUT A PERJURY CONVICTION WOULD HAVE TO BE TURNED OVER IRRESPECTIVE OF THE TIME LIMIT. THE WELL ONLY UNDERSTAND ROBINSON SIX. THIS IS A LOT HARDER. I'M NOT SURE I'M GOING TO VOTE ON THIS THANK YOU. FIFTY S. THE I'M READY WHEN YOU YES YOU MAKE. OKAY OFF LET ME THINK YOU FOR A HOLDING TRUE TO YOUR AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'VE TAKEN. THAT MAKES THIS BILL AS SOON AS REASONABLE. AS IT IS NOW- I DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE BILL AS A- YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE THE AMBIGUITY OF MORAL TURPITUDE GIVES ME LITTLE CONSTERNATION. AND THE INCONSISTENCY FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY OF. HOW YOU DEFINE THAT IS THIS A DIFFICULTY HOWEVER I DO SEE THE ATTENTION. TO BE NORMAL FOR WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH AND BY THE TIME WE NEED TO BUILD BACK. PUBLIC TRUST. I THINK THAT THIS IS A REPORT MEASURE FOR US TO HELP SUPPORT AND HOPEFULLY WE GET TO A PLACE TO WHERE. PEOPLE WILL SEE THAT FOR WHAT YU'RE INTENDED TO TRY TO ACCOMPLISH SO. YOU'LL GET MY SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU SOMEONE MEMBER- WE ARE CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT THERE FIFTY COUNTIES WITH MAYBE FIFTY DIFFERENT STANDARDS THAT'S WHY WE'RE TRYING TO CODIFY AND STANDARDIZED SUCH THAT IT IF THE APPELLATE COURT IN CALIFORNIA TO FIND SOMETHING IS- IMPACTING MORAL TURPITUDE THAT APPLIES TO ALL THE COUNTS. BY STATEWIDE. THANK YOU FOR ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU MAY CLOSE MISTER AMBER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING SO DILIGENTLY ON THIS I REQUEST AN HONORABLE. AND I AND I THANK YOU I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING VERY. VERY HARD IS THE NUMBER. NUMBER CALLS WE'VE HAD IT BEEN NUMEROUS AND WE'VE GOT ALL THIS AND I COMMEND YOU FOR WORKING COMMITTEE FOR PUTTING THE MEMBERS TO TRY TO GET AS CLOSE OR CLOSER- I REALLY THINK WE NEED TO GET THIS OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE SO THAT. THAT AND I ALSO KNOW YOUR COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE WORKING THAT THIS ISN'T THE LAST STOP. AND OBVIOUS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL AS WAS SAID EARLIER PEOPLE GETTING PROSECUTED. BECAUSE THE FALSE EVIDENCE AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE AND I GREW UP WITH MY VICE CHAIR IT COULD START TO BUILD. SOME CONFIDENCE IN OUR LEGAL SYSTEM WHEN WE START TO UNVEIL ALL OF THOSE. OUR I WOULD LOVE TO CALL CRIMES THAT. MISINFORMATION IT SENT PEOPLE TO JAIL THE MESSAGE THEIR LIVES THEIR LIVELIHOOD AND KEEPING THE CAR SERRATED- THAT WE NEED THE STATE. DA'S AND NEED ALL THE EVIDENCE THAT THEY NEED TO KNOW YOU TO TURN IT OVER TO PUBLIC DEFENDER SO THAT THEY NEED TO KNOW AND SO BUT- WE NEED TO GET THERE. SO THANK YOU THANK YOU. WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND. VENTURE GLOBAL. ON SB TWELVE TWENTY THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER HI JONES SAWYER HI LACKEY LACKEY HI BARRICADE HAND HOW CAN I DEEP. DEEP I KAMLAGER KAMLAGER NOT VOTING COURT OBERNOLTE CORP NOT VOTING SANTIAGO. SAN DIEGO HI STONE. WITH THE MEASURE PASSES THANK REFORM. I OFTEN SAY THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER SO I'M MORE DISCOUNT SO RIGHT RIGHT I. I'VE BEEN SAYING THAT FOR THIRTY YEARS SO OF THE NEXT MEASURE IS SB ELEVEN NINETY SIX SB ELEVEN NINETY SIX SIMPLY CODIFIES THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER ON PRICE GOUGING AND ADDS A ANOTHER PROVISION THAT CLOSE A LOOPHOLE FOR. THOSE WHO ARE NEW SELLERS TO THE MARKET SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WEREN'T SELLING HAND SANITIZER AND THEN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE EMERGENCY YOU GET. ON THAT- THAT HAND SANITIZER SOAP I URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY IT D. OF WITNESSES RIGHT I KNOW THAT THEIR. WHEN SHE HIT ON THE HEAD WITH. MAYBE MR BOTH I HAVE KNOW. I HAD LESLIE YOUNG SAID TOM PUBLIC YOUR I'M SO IF THERE THE ON THE LINE. THEY NOT WE TAKE A LITTLE OF WARD IF THEY'RE ON THE TO BE BUT- OKAY. LET FOR YOUNG. YOU MAY MONTH DIRECT AT THAT RIGHT HERE THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR IN COMMITTEE THAT MY NAME IS LESLIE YOUNG AND I IN THE AT THE IF YOU'RE ATTORNEY CHARGE OF THE FRAUD UNIT OF THE ORANGE COUNTY JUST ATTORNEY OFFICE. ON BEHALF OF ORANGE COUNTY DIST ATTORNEY SPITZER I WOULD LIKE TO. SO BYRD FOR. TO FILL. WE LEARNED A FEW THINGS QUICKLY THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE BRICK AND MORTAR BUSINESSES WE CONTACTED RELATING TO PRICE COMPLAINTS. WERE GOOD CITIZENS WHO WANTED TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND WHEN THEY HAVE RAISED THEIR PRICES IT WAS BECAUSE THERE COSTS HAD INCREASED HOWEVER WE ALSO LEARNED THAT THERE IS A SEGMENT OF THE SELLERS OUT THERE WHO WOULD JUMP INTO THE BUSINESS OF SELLING THAT ITEM FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROFITING FROM THE CRISIS. UNFORTUNATELY THESE WERE NEW SELLERS WHO WERE NOT COVERED BY THE CURRENT PRICE GOUGING LAW IF YOU'LL CODE SECTION THREE NINETY SIX. SB. ELEVEN NINETY SIX AMEND PENAL CODE THREE NINETY SIX YOU MAKE IT APPLY TO NEW SELLERS. CREATING A PRESUMPTION THAT A NEW SELLER WHO CHARGES MORE THAN 50% ABOUT THEIR COST FOR THE PRODUCT IS GETTING PRICE GOUGING. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP THE STOCK PROFITEERS FROM TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OUR CITIZENS DURING A CRISIS. WE THINK THIS COMMITTEE FOR CONSIDERATION AND STRONGLY URGE AN ITEM. ON SB ELEVEN NINETY SIX. AND MEDICARE IS POP GEORGE. FROM THE SAN DIEGO OFFICE CAN YOU HEAR ME. I SURE CAN. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. ON TOM PAPA GEORGE FROM SAN DIEGO D. A. I'M IN CHARGE OF THE SAN DIEGO CA CONSUMER PROTECTION UNIT. AS YOU HEARD OUR CURRENT LAW PROHIBITS PRICE GOUGING EVER DO THIS AGAIN. DURING DECLARED EMERGENCIES I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT I DRAFTED THE ORIGINAL PENAL CODE SECTION THREE NINETY SIX. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RICHARD KATZ AFTER THE NINETY FOUR SAN FERNANDO EARTHQUAKE. AND OVER THE YEARS- THE LAW HAS PROVEN TO BE A VERY VALUABLE TOOL TO HELP US. PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM THIS KIND OF ABUSE BUT OUR CURRENT OVER THE VIRGIN SHE HAS SHOWN THAT WE NEED TO UPDATE THE LAW. IN SEVERAL WAYS AT FIRST THE BILL CLARIFIES THAT PRICE GOUGING APPLIES TO ALL DECLARED EMERGENCIES. INCLUDING PANDEMICS AND EPIDEMICS. AND YOU ALSO INCLUDING ONLINE SELLERS- THAT'S NOT SPECIFIED IN CURRENT LAN THIS ELIMINATES THAT UNCERTAINTY. MOST IMPORTANT THE CURRENT LAW DOES NOT COVER THOSE WHO DID NOT SELL BEFORE THE DECLARATION EMERGENCY. THE REASON FOR THAT IS BACK IN NINETY FOUR- THE INTERNET MARKETPLACE FOLKS JUMPING INTO OFFERED IN NINETY FIVE MASKS RIGHT RAISES PRICES SIMPLY WASN'T OF MARKETPLACE PHENOMENON BUT TODAY IT MOST DEFINITELY IS. WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE NEW SELLERS TO POP UP OVERNIGHT THIS BILL X. STANDS A LOT OF COVER NEW SELLERS AS WELL AS EXISTING SELLERS SO THE LOP PLIAGE EQUALLY TO ALL BUSINESSES. IT ALSO GIVES YOU THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR THE RIGHT TO EXTEND THESE PROHIBITIONS. FOR MORE THAN THIRTY DAYS IF NEEDED WE'VE NOW SEEN AT A DECLARE CRISIS CAN LAST MONTHS SO WE THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT FLEXIBILITY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC ADEQUATELY. WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS WE THANK YOU FOR ATTENTION AND HOPE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS IMPROVEMENT TO OUR PRICE GOUGING LAW. THANK YOU THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES OF IT THERE ARE NO OTHER WITNESSES BUT MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO NOTE THAT WE ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S MOMENTS. ARE SPENT ASHA SO. YOU FOR X. COMMITTEE.

THE REMARKS OF THE- REMOVED OPPOSITION IS THERE ANOTHER AMENDMENT THAT WE'RE NOT AWARE THAT IT WILL THIS IS LATE BREAKING- YEAH YES OF. MISTER ROBBIE ANI AND HIS CLIENTS WERE CONCERNED THAT FOR EXAMPLE IF A BUSHEL OF WHEAT ON THE CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE. OF INCREASED IN PRICE BY MORE THAN 10% THAT THAT THERE MIGHT BE A POSSIBILITY THAT A DISTRICT ATTORNEY CALIFORNIA WOULD PROSECUTE I THINK THAT POSSIBILITY IS EXTREMELY REMOTE. BUT RATHER RATHER THAN. WORRY ABOUT THAT POSSIBILITY- WE'VE AGREED THAT IF THERE IS A COMMODITY THAT'S LISTED ON A NATIONAL OR INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE. AND THEN THE PRICE FLUCTUATION IS A IS SORT OF A NORMAL COURSE OF ACTIVITY THAT THAT IS NOT SUBJECT TO PRICE GOUGING. THANK YOU YES YES OUR FEDERAL NUMBER THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TAKING A MOMENT I DID HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS AS THE SEASON FARMERS AND OTHER AGRICULTURAL GROUPS- AND- MUCH SUPPORT TO BUILD THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS YES. MISTER TYLER D. THANK YOU MATH OF SENATE NUMBER OF THE- THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO. A CO SPONSOR THIS MEASURE SOWITH YOU- I JUST WANTED TO RAISE A POINT- IT IN TERMS OF- THIS MEASURE. BEING RETROACTIVELY APPLY I KNOW THAT YOU SAID YOU TOOK THE COMMITTEE MEMBER AND I HAVE I'M NOT SURE WHAT. IF THAT AMENDMENT ADDRESS- THAT CONCERN BUT- WOULD YOU COMMENT. THE FACT THAT. YOUR BILL WOULD. RETROACTIVELY PENALIZE PEOPLE WHO MAY BE- CHARGE A HIGHER PRICES BECAUSE THE TO THE PANDEMIC SO THIS. IN ESSENCE CODIFIES THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER SO TO THE EXTENT THAT SOMEONE IS ENGAGING ACTIVITY IT'S VIOLATIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER THEY WOULD BE SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL PROSECUTION. HOWEVER YES TO THE NEW PROVISION WHICH IS THE PROVISION THAT PROVIDES IF YOU'RE A NEW ENTRANT IN THE MARKET PLACE AND YOU INCREASE PRICE ABOVE 50% BOB YOU WOULD NOT BE SO YOU CAN'T BE SUBJECT TO A CRIMINAL PENALTY FOR A LAW THAT'S OT AFFECTED THE TIME THE ACT OCCURS SO- THIS IS NO DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER. CRIMINAL. PROVISION PENAL CODE PROVISION RIGHT. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS YOU MAY CLOSE MISTER AMBER AYE URGENT AYE VOTE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THE NEXT YEAR SHARES RECKON MINION I VOTE ESPECIALLY FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK OF MEDICARE WHAT. DO YOU CALL THE ROLL. ON SB ELEVEN NINETY SIX THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER HI JOHN SO YOUR IRAQI. JACKIE H BARRICADE CAN BARRICADE HAND DEEP. HI KAMLAGER. KAMLAGER I WORK ONE QUICK HI SANTIAGO SAN DIEGO I STILL. AS A THE MEASURE PANIC YOU IT MR BODY CALLS PLEASE GIVE. AND NOW DO ITEMS EIGHTEEN IN NINETEEN SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX. AT S. B. TEN SIXTY FOUR- THAT'S SKINNER WHICH SERVICE SEVEN SIX EXPERIENCE THE CATEGORY OF PEACE OFFICERS RELEASE OF RECORDS. AND IN SIXTEEN SIXTY FOUR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANTS. WHICH EVERYONE YOU WANT TO DO FIRST. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT THAT SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX- AS SOME OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR. FOR FORTY YEARS CALIFORNIA HAD A COMPLETE BAN TOTAL SECRECY ON ALL POLICE RECORD. THAT CHANGED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WITH THE PASSAGE OF SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE AND SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE ALLOWED FOR A LIMITED SET OF RECORDS- TO BE ABLE TO BE ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC IN A VERY LIMITED SET- I THINK WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN RECENT MONTHS IS THAT. OUR COMMUNITIES. DEMAND MORE. AND THAT ALL OF US DESERVE TO KNOW ABOUT THE CONDUCT OF THE OFFICERS WHO WERE ON THE BEACH IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. AND WHILE SOME OF OUR POLICE UNIONS FOUGHT AGAINST FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE VERY STRENUOUSLY. THERE IS A VERY DIFFERENT ATTITUDE AMONGST OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY TODAY AND PORAC HAS RECENTLY THOSE LARGEST UNION HAS RECENTLY PUT OUT THEIR STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES WHERE THEY INCLUDE. SUPPORT FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY. AND SO WHAT SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX DOES IS IT BUILDS ON FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE. AND IT STRENGTHENS OUR CURRENT LAW BY EXPANDING ACCESS TO RECORDS ON A WIDER RANGE OF USES OF FORCE. IT ALSO ALLOWS US TO FIND OUT ABOUT ANY OFFICERS THAT MAY HAVE A HISTORY OF ENGAGING IN RACIST OR DISCRIMINATORY ACTIONS. IT ALSO ALERT SAYS FIND OUT ABOUT INFORMATION ABOUT OFFICERS WHO HAVE A HISTORY OF CONDUCTING WRONGFUL ARRESTS OR WRONGFUL SEARCHES. AND SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE WAYS IN WHICH THE RECORDS ARE EXPANDED. ADDITIONALLY WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IS THAT IN SOME CASES AN OFFICER WHO MAY HAPPENED WHERE THERE MAY BE THE AGENCY MAY BE INITIATING INVESTIGATION THAT THE OFFICER CHOOSES TO RESIGN. AND THEN THE INVESTIGATION THERE'S NO REAL PAPER TRAIL. AND THEN THE NEXT AGENCY WHO MIGHT HIRE THAT OFFICER HAS NO INFORMATION ABOUT THAT CONTACT SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS ALSO REQUIRED THAT A RECORD BE COMPLETED IF AN OFFICER RESIGNS PRIOR TO ANY COMPLETED INVESTIGATION. AND THEN IF- IF YOU ARE THE HIRING AGENCY IN YOUR HIRING SOMEONE WHO WAS A FORMER OFFICER THAT YOU REQUEST THE FULL ARRAY OF RECORDS SO DO YOU HAVE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE BACKGROUND OF THE OFFICER THAT YOU'RE HIRING BECAUSE THE OTHER THING THAT WE HEAR VERY COMMONLY AS WE SOMETIMES HEAR EITHER MAYORS POLICE CHIEFS RATHER SAY WE DID NOT KNOW. THE HIS THIS BACKGROUND ABOUT THIS OFFICER. SO IT HELPS ENSURE THAT WE KNOW. IT ALSO ALLOWS FOR THE HOLDING OF RECORDS LONGER THAN FIVE YEARS NOW THE RECORDS OR ELECTRONIC OUR STATUTE THAT ONLY REQUIRED FIVE YEARS OF RECORDS ONE WAS REALLY APPROPRIATE WHEN OUR RECORDS WERE JUST PAPER NOW ALL OF OUR RECORDS OR ELECTRONIC THERE'S NO REASON TO HAVE THEM. ELIMINATED AFTER FIVE YEARS ONLY FINALLY IT DEALS WITH THE FACT THAT SOME AGENCIES WERE VERY RELUCTANT TO RELEASE RECORDS AND EITHER. DID NOT FOUR CHARGED EXORBITANT FEES TO THE PUBLIC- REQUESTING THEM SO THE BILL HAS SOME PROVISIONS REGARDING THAT. AND I WOULD NOTE THAT THE BILL DOES NOT GO AS FAR AS THE LAW THAT NEW YORK PASSED RECENTLY WHEN THEY REPEALED THEIR LAW FIFTY EIGHT. BUT I THINK THIS IS A VERY IT BRINGS CALIFORNIA MUCH CLOSER IN LINE WITH MANY MANY OTHER STATES THAT HAVE MORE TRANSPARENCY AROUND POLICE RECORDS AND I THINK THAT IT FITS. THAT APPROPRIATE- THAT APPROPRIATE RIGHT OF THE PUBLIC TO KNOW. WHILE STILL PROTECTING OUR OFFICERS FROM HAVING FRIVOLOUS OR- OR YOU KNOW COMPLAINTS THAT ARE UNFOUNDED BEING RELEASED THERE'S NO REASON FOR SUCH THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT WE CERTAINLY ALL DESERVE TO KNOW IF AN OFFICER HAS ANY KIND OF HISTORY OF- CONDUCT IN THE IN THE AREAS THAT I DESCRIBED- I HAVE SOME WITNESSES TECHNICAL WITNESSES. WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH INVESTIGATIONS AND- IN WHO WILL WHO ARE- OFFERED THEIR INSIGHT ON THE BILL. OKAY SO IS THIS GOING TO BE LESS YES AND SUSAN LEFT YES. RIGHT WE CAN. I THINK IT MODERATOR. WE GET THE LOTTERY. ARE YOU READY I'M SORRY MY MIGRATED. KELLY OF THE LIST LAW OFFICES OF KELLY OF THE LIST AND SUSAN LEFT- CITY PA THEY MAY COME IN NOW MODERATOR. JUST A MOMENT HERE. BUT USING YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU MODERATOR AND THANK YOU TO CHAIR JONES SAWYER COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THE SENATOR SKINNER FOR AUTHORING THIS IMPORTANT BILL. I MOSTLY HERE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX I'M AWARE OF THE LATENESS AND HOW LONG WE'VE BEEN GOING- MY EXPERTISE IN THIS AREA COMES FROM MY UNIQUE EXPERIENCES. BOTH AS SOMEONE WHO'S WORKED ON POLICE POLICIES I'VE ADMINISTRATIVELY PROSECUTED POLICE OFFICERS AT THE SAN FRANCISCO POLICE COMMISSION- AND I'VE BEEN A PUBLIC DEFENDER ATTORNEY AND I'M ON THE BOARD OF CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. I DO KNOWN AS SAID SKINNER JUST DISCUSS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE MADE A VERY SPECIFIC. LIMITED AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ABOUT CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. BECOME PUBLIC RECORDS. YET EVEN AFTER SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION IS STILL HIDDEN BEHIND POLICE SECRECY RULE. SENATORS JUST SPOKE A MOMENT AGO ABOUT HOW RECENTLY NEW YORK STATE PASSED A SWEEPING NEW REFORM LAW REFER TO IT FIFTY EIGHT AND THAT BUILT MAKES ALL POLICE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AS PUBLIC RECORDS. THE PROBLEM THERE IS THAT NEW YORK'S BILL IS NOW GOING TO BE HELD UP IN SIGNIFICANT ABOUT LITIGATION BECAUSE THE POLICE OFFICERS ARE CHALLENGING IT. HERE IN CALIFORNIA THOUGH WE'RE IN A DIFFERENT PLACE THE POLICE ALSO CHALLENGED SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE BUT EVERY SINGLE TIME THE COURTS RULED THAT SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE IS CONSTITUTIONAL. SO THIS BILL IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX IS A MUCH MORE MODERATE AN INCREMENTAL APPROACH THAN WHAT NEW YORK IS DONE. SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX WITH EXPAND THE CURRENT CATEGORY THAT SENATOR SKINNER JUST TALKED ABOUT AND HOLD OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR BROADER SPECTRUM OF MISCONDUCT INCLUDING RACIST HOMOPHOBIC ANTI SEMITIC OR OTHER DISCRIMINATORY BEHAVIOR. ANY USES OF FORCE AND WE PAUSE FOR A MOMENT- THE CURRENT BILL SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE PAUSES ON THE AREA OF GREAT BODILY INJURY BEING BEING OUT FORCED ON SOMEONE FOR ON GAS. WHAT IT DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THOUGH IS SIGNIFICANT AS SORT OF THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG BECAUSE YOU HAVE LOTS OF SITUATIONS WHERE. COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE DEALING WITH AN OFFICER WHO PULLED A GUN ON SOMEBODY NOBODY AT THE END OF THAT ENDS UP WITH GREAT BODILY INJURY OR DEATH. BUT THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR IS THE USE OF FORCE AND PATTERNS OF OFFICER COMMITTING THAT KIND OF BE MISCONDUCT. SHOULD BE THE KIND THAT WORK WE'RE ABLE TO KEEP AND NOT THE KIND OF BROAD BROADER- INFORMATION WE WOULD GET UNDER SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX THAT IS NOT CURRENTLY CAPTURED UNDER FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE. SENATOR SKINNER SAID OUR COMMUNITIES DESERVE MORE AND- REALLY THE ONLY WAY TO GET. THE PUBLIC TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN OUR LEGAL SYSTEM AS CHAIR JONES SAWYER SAID IT EARLIER WITH TWELVE TWENTY. IS THROUGH TRANSPARENCY IT'S THE ONLY WAY. TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. I REMAIN AVAILABLE ON THE PHONE TO ANSWER ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL OF PROVIDED AYE VOTE ON SEVEN SEVEN SIX. THANK YOU. AND NOW SUSAN LEFT SHE- YEAH THAT WOULD I THINK WE'RE WAITING FOR KELLY KELLY I'M SORRY. HI THERE THIS IS KELLY IN THE LEFT HAND SIDE ARE YOU ABLE TO HEAR ME YES. A GREAT ADVENTURE NEED SPECIALIZING IN THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT MY CLIENT GOOD NEWS ORGANIZATIONS. AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. HISTORIC PASSAGE OF SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE MANY OF US HAVE FACED UNPRECEDENTED HEARD ALL GETTING A TO BE COMPLY WITH THE LAW. ALTHOUGH THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT WAS CLEAR THAT IT CAN'T HAVE BEEN LARGELY IGNORED EVERY WORD IN THE STATUTE HAS BECOME A BATTLEFIELD BEING READ BY AGENCIES IN A WAY THAT ATTEMPT TO LIMIT OR AVOID GETS CLOSER. EVEN IF YOU ARE FREQUENTLY IGNORING DEADLINES AND REQUIRE INSTEAD OF THE PUBLIC AGENCIES HAVE DESTROYED THEM I EVEN WANT THE CLOSER BECOMES INEVITABLE THE RECORD THE HEAVILY REDACTED. SB SEVEN SEVEN SIXTEEN CHANGE BACK IF THE MUCH STEP FORWARD IN CLOSING THE LOOPHOLE THAT HAVE BEEN EXPLOITED IT REQUIRED WORK TENSION OF RECORD PROVIDING AGENCIES FROM SHOOTING DESTRUCTION OVER DISCLOSURE AND EXPAND THE CATEGORY OF THE GLOBAL INCIDENT. AREAS WHERE WE KNOW WE HAVE PROBLEM I INTO UNDER WARRANTY YOU COULD THE FOURTH REGARDLESS OF THE EXTENT OF DAMAGE IN TWO AREAS OF RACISM BIAS DISCRIMINATION AND WRONGFUL PURCHASED IN IRAQ.

GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN BURKE SHAUN RUNDLE WITH THE CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION OR CTO AT THAT WE ARE A NON UNION LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION APARTMENT TWENTY TWO THOUSAND COPS WHO WANT TO BE A MEET THE BEST COPS. BUT WHILE THERE ARE VARIOUS- POLICING AND RECORD REFORM EFFORTS OF LATE INCLUDING MEASURES THIS YEAR THAT WE HAVE NOT ONLY SUPPORTED BUT PUSHED OUT FOR SB SEVEN SEVENTY SIX IS REGRETTABLY NOT ONE OF THEM. THE ARGUMENTS IN SUPPORT NEAR ANALYSIS NOTES THAT THE BILL WOULD PROVIDE THE PUBLIC WITH ACCESS TO PROVEN INCIDENTS OF SEXUAL ASSAULTS WERE. PLANTED EVIDENCE PERJURY EXCEPT FOR. OUR BY REMOVING THE SUSTAIN STANDARD IN THE BILL WHICH IS THE LEGAL THRESHOLD IS NO WE'RE NEED TO IT'S PROVEN BY A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE AND REPLACING IT WITH. THE DETERMINATION OF COMPLAIN WAS WHAT NOT PRIVILEGE PER NO BASIS FOR THE INCIDENT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT. AND THAT WOULD BE TURNED ON. NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS AGAINST DEPARTMENT WITH SUCH A LOW THRESHOLD. IT WOULD ESPECIALLY CRIPPLE SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED DEPARTMENTS WHICH ARE QUITE COMMON THROUGHOUT YOUR DISTRICT. IT'S A FAILURE TO REPORT DUE PROCESS OF LAW BY REQUIRING ALL ALLEGATIONS OF PURCHASE A DISCRIMINATION BE DISCLOSED. WITHOUT A LEGAL FINDING OF THE FACT GIVE ME MAKING SUCH DETERMINATION BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. THAT MAKE NO MISTAKE THAT THE FIRST PERSON TO WISH FOR THE BALLOT IN SUBSEQUENT ACCOUNTABILITY OF A BAD COP IS A GOOD COP- THAT'S WHY AGENCIES INSTITUTE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY TOOLS LIKE BODY WORN CAMERAS. YOU BEFORE YEARS BEFORE RECENT HEADLINES WHY BRADY EXCEPT THE INITIAL JUST DISCUSSED. MANY PEOPLE TO AND THE REPORTING BURDEN BY LOWERING THE THRESHOLD FOR REQUESTING ACCESS TO SUCH RECORDS WHILE LOCAL OFFICIALS AND MANY AREAS ARE ARE PROPOSING SHIFTING FUNDS AWAY FROM LOCAL POLICING AGENCY THAT'S NOT A SOUND. QUALITY TO LOOK UP TO APPROACH TO REACH A COMMON GOAL THAT WE ALL SHARE. WHICH IS THE PRESERVATION OF THE COMMUNITY STRUCK IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY PERSONNEL WHO SWORE AN OATH TO PROTECT THEM. THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE CONSTITUTION THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AGENCIES NEED TO BE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH THE MANDATE THE TRANSCRIPTS REQUIREMENTS TO REACH THAT COMMON GOAL BUT THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO IN OUR OPINION UNDER THIS BILL. AND SO FOR THE SAKE OF PEACE OFFICERS ENGAGING WITH AND KEEPING YOUR CONSTITUENTS YOU STAY CLEAR AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX THANK. THANK YOU. IN SEVILLA COREY. MISTER MODERATOR.

THANK YOU THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN IF YOU'RE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. AT THIS TIME WE HAVE NO FURTHER IN OPPOSITION PLEASE CONTINUE MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU BRING YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MISTER CARE I DID NOT OPEN WITH THAT I AM TAKING THE AMENDMENT THAT CLARIFIES THAT THE COMPLAINTS MUST BE WELL FOUNDED THE THANK YOU ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WAS RAISED IN THE CALLS WAS THAT IT PREVIOUSLY JUST- SAID THEY WOULD NOT BE FRIVOLOUS BUT- WITH YOUR COMMITTEES ASSISTANCE WE OF CLARIFYING NOW THAT THE COMPLAINTS MUST BE WELL FOUNDED.THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION OCTOBER. THANK YOU. OKAY. I JOIN YOU AND WANTING TO. MAKE REASONABLE TRANSPARENCY AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC WITH AS IT RELATES TO MISCONDUCT HOWEVER. I HAVE SOME STRONG CONCERNS ON THE LANGUAGE OF THIS BEEN SELECTED I REALLY TRULY WISH THAT THE TERM SUSTAINED. WOULD HAVE BEEN. YOUR UP AND THAT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT WAS THE TERM YOU JUST USED. WELL FUNDED- IF I COULD DEFINE TO THE CHAIR IF THAT'S THAT'D BE HELPFUL YES SIR SO. THE FIRST VERSION OF THE BILL OR THE BILL WITHOUT THIS AMENDMENT JUST LEFT AT THAT THE COMPLAINTS COULD NOT BE FRIVOLOUS BUT THE ADDITION OF THAT THEY MUST BE WELL FOUNDED IS THE SAME STANDARD DELETE SAME LEGAL STANDARD THAT WE USE CALIFORNIA USES FOR THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT AFFECTING OTHER PUBLIC OFFICERS FOR EXAMPLE TEACHERS SO IN OTHER WORDS THE WELL FOUNDED IN THE DEFINITION AND IT'S AN WITH THE AMENDMENT WILL BE DEFINED IN THE BILL. THE INVESTIGATION MUST CLEARLY ESTABLISH THAT THE ALLEGATION IS NOT TRUE SNOWBIRDS UNFOUNDED MUST ESTABLISH THAT IT'S NOT TRUE SO WELL FOUNDED. OBVIOUSLY IS THE OPPOSITE. OKAY LET LET I HAVE A COUPLE OF CONCERNS I NEED TO JUST KIND OF SHARE WITH YOU- FIRST OF ALL THE TERM COMPLAINT. IS ALSO A LITTLE CLEAR DOES NOT LIMIT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE RELEASE ABILITY ARE LEAST THE PROTECTION THAT YOU JUST INDICATED TO CITIZENS COMPLAINTS. OR WE TALKING ABOUT INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS LIKE ADVERSE ACTIONS INVESTIGATIONS WHICH ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE ARE USUALLY DRIVEN THROUGH THE AGENCY THAT SHELTERS ARE INITIATED THROUGH THE AGENCIES. AT AROUND- THE BILL WOULD ALLOW. FOR COMPLAINTS BUT ALSO FOR INTERNAL DOES NOTREQUIRE SO IN OTHER WORDS IF THE AGENCY ITSELF HAS FOUNDED THAT THE OFFICER HAS ENGAGED IN THESE INCREASE RECORD THEN THAT'S AN AVAILABLE RECORD. BUT WHAT IF THEY'RE FOUND. DIFFERENTLY AND FOUND THERE IS NOT IF IT IS FOUND UNFOUNDED THEN THE RECORD WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE BECAUSE THAT THAT SEEMS TO BE REALLY AMBIGUOUS AND CAUSE RIGHT. AND THIS PARTICULAR BELT AT THAT TALKS ABOUT. THE RECORD OF THE CIVILIAN COMPLAINT AND YOU'RE STRUCK THE WORD CIVILIAN. AND JUST INDICATED COMPLAINT BUT I JUST THINK IT'S REALLY. CONCERNING THE WAY THAT IT'S CURRENTLY WRITTEN AND- I WOULD HOPE THAT MAYBE WE CAN CLARIFY THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT- C. H. HERE'S WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND MYSELF SHARE OF DEEP DEEP CONCERNS I MEAN. WE HAD SENATE BILL FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE WHICH- I FELT WAS NEGOTIATED AND- IT WAS AN ISSUE THAT. WAS TRYING TO IT CAME WITH SOME RESISTANCE NO QUESTION BUT I THINK THAT THE MOTIVATION WAS WAS IN THE RIGHT AREA AND I THINK THAT WE ARE MOVING IN A WAY THAT. THE PUBLIC WAS BENEFITTED AND NOW WE'VE GONE TO AN AREA THAT'S CREATED SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY. AND HERE'S WHERE THE ROBINS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND I KNOW I KNOW IT'S PERCEIVED DIFFERENTLY BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE BECAUSE THERE ARE. LISTEN I WAS THE FIRST LINE SUPERVISOR FOR EIGHTEEN OF MY TWENTY EIGHT YEARS. AND I'VE INVESTIGATED MANY MANY MANY CITIZENS COMPLAINTS. SOME WERE WELL WELL WELL FUNDED AND- WE'RE THANKFUL THAT THEY WERE BROUGHT FORWARD. BECAUSE THEY- THEY WERE PART OF THE HEALING PROCESS AND THEN WERE PAR ALSO PART OF MAKING SUPERVISION AND THE DEPARTMENT AWARE OF MISCONDUCT. AND THAT ISN'T THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO BUILD BACK TRUST WITH OUR WITH OUR PUBLIC. HOWEVER THERE ALSO ARE SOME. HIGHLY MOTIVATED INDIVIDUALS WHO JUST WANT TO DISCREDIT. PEOPLE IN UNIFORM. AND I KNOW THAT SOME MAY FIND THAT TROUBLING SOME MAY NOT EVEN CARE BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT. THE INTEGRITY THAT'S ATTACKED UNFAIRLY ALSO NEEDS TO BE GUARDED. AND I'M I'M JUST TELLING YOU THAT- THERE'S TOO MANY AMBIGUITIES IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL THAT MAKES ME FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT THOSE ARE NOT GUARDED. AND IF WE CAN GET TO A POINT TO WHERE WE COULD KNOW THAT THOSE FALSE ACCUSATIONS BECAUSE- ESPECIALLY NOW. WHEN THE SENTIMENT TAZ BECOME WHITE ANTI POLICE THAT'S PROBABLY THE MORE LIKELY THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME OF THOSE ALLEGATIONS BROUGHT FORWARD AND- PEOPLE WHO ARE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO ARE JUST TRYING TO SERVE THE PUBLIC AND ARE DOING THEIR LEVEL BEST BUT YET. THEY HAVE. THE FIERCELY MOTIVATED PEOPLE. TO BRING THESE ALLEGATIONS FORWARD THERE NEEDS TO BE SAFEGUARDS TO PROTECT THOSE OFFICERS. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL GOES IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT YOUR INTENTION. BUT WE HAVE TO FEEL AT LEAST DIED I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THEM BUT I KNOW I NEED TO FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE BUT THOSE ARE PRETTY. BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE NOT AFFORDED THAT. THAT COMPANY COOPER RIGHT NOW SO- YEAH I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY. BUT HOPEFULLY WE CAN AMENDED TO A POINT TO WHERE. WE CAN FEEL LIKE THOSE. UNFAIR ALLEGATIONS CAN BE PROTECTED. YEAH ANY OTHER COMMENTS. OKAY YOU MAY CLOSE CENTER THANK YOU CHAIR IN ADDRESSING- THE ISSUE THAT ALLOWED MUCH OF THE OPPOSITION RAISED AND ALSO- ASSEMBLY MEMBER. I SHARE THAT CONCERN BECAUSE IT IT IS ABSOLUTELY THE CASE NOT ONLY I MEAN OBVIOUSLY- ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS CAN BE TO TARGET CERTAIN PEOPLE BUT IF WE THINK ABOUT. ANYONE IN PUBLIC SERVICE THERE CAN BE- INDIVIDUALS ARE RESIDENTS WHO HAVE A BONE TO PICK AND CAN. MAKE A CONTINUOUS. UNFOUNDED FRIVOLOUS WHAT HAVE YOU COMPLAINTS AND CERTAINLY I SHARE YOUR CONCERN AND THE CONCERN THAT WAS A REFERENCE BY THE OPPOSITION THAT I DO NOT WANT FRIVOLOUS OR I DO NOT WANT TO RELEASE RECORDS RELATED TO THAT WHAT I WANT IS FOR ONLY RECORDS FOR THAT ARE ACTUAL. THAT GIVE US THE INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER AN OFFICER HAS BEEN FOUND IN AN INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN FOUNDED TO HAVE AN OFFICER ENGAGE IN THE BEHAVIORS THAT COVERED BY THIS BILL SO AND I DON'T HAVE TO REPEAT THEM. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE STAFF OF THE COMMITTEE HELPING US BECAUSE WHEN WE WERE STRUGGLED WE WERE. WE FOUND IS THAT SUBSTANTIATED HAD A CERTAIN. LEVEL THAT WAS ALMOST SO HIGH THAT IT DIDN'T UNCOVER. THE SOME OF THESE ACT- SOME OF THIS LEGITIMATE INFORMATION AND SO WE WERE TRYING TO GET AT STILL A PROTECTION OBVIOUSLY FOR OUR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS AND YET STILL RESPECT THE RIGHT. OF RESIDENTS TO HAVE INFORMATION AND THAT'S WHERE THE COMMITTEE STAFF REALLY HELPED US WITH USING THAT IT MUST BE WELL FOUNDED. NO CERTAINLY AS THE BILL MOVES THIS IS A CONVERSATION I'M WILLING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE BECAUSE- I WAS VERY HEARTENED BY FOR EXAMPLE FOR A STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLE I'VE BEEN VERY HEARTENED BY- THE KIND OF THE INTROSPECTION THAT ALL OF US I THINK ARE GOING THROUGH- IN RECENT MONTHS. ABOUT PEOPLE WHAT WHAT HOW HOW POLICING AND PUBLIC SAFETY IN OUR COMMUNITIES NEEDS TO BE CHANGED. AND SO I WANT TO STRIKE THAT- THAT GOOD BALANCE AND SO I COMMIT TO WORKING ON IT- IT MAY BE THAT. THAT WILL HELP I HOPE THAT WE CAN COME UP WITH THE PLACE WHERE PEOPLE ARE COMFORTABLE. WE'LL SEE WE'LL SEE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER. YOU YOU YOU MAY CLOSE A DESERT SHE CLOSED I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU AND I WILL MAKE THE AND I'VE ABSOLUTELY MAKE THAT COMMITMENT OKAY THEN I AM I'M HEARTENED TO HEAR THAT BECAUSE EVEN. EVEN A AMENDMENTS THAT WE WERE MOVING TOWARD THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE TAKING WAS ADDRESSING EXACTLY WHAT YES WHAT NOT ONLY LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT MR BY CULTURE MAY HERE WAS TALKING ABOUT AND INDIVIDUALLY- AS A PUBLIC SECTOR UNION EMPLOYEE. I BEEN A MESSAGE WHERE THE RESPONSIVE STATED. ALLEGATIONS THAT PROVED TO BE ABSOLUTELY FALSE AND I ALWAYS TELL EXAMPLE OF- EMPLOYED IT WASN'T WORKING BUT IN DOING THEIR WORK VERY WELL EXCUSE ME OF BEING RACIST TOWARDS BLACK PEOPLE. OF BUT I HAD TO GO TO AN INVESTIGATION. OBVIOUSLY WAS UNFOUNDED AND BUT DURING THAT TIME OF THE INVESTIGATION YOU HAVE THAT CLOUD OVER YOUR HEAD AND I'M PRETTY SURE THERE WERE PROBABLY SOME PROMOTIONAL OPPORTUNITIES THAT MISSED OUT BECAUSE I WAS UNDER INVESTIGATION AND SO I ALSO UNDERSTAND HOW. YOU COULD BE TARNISHED. JUST BY AN ALLEGATION OF FRIVOLOUS ALLEGATION- THAT COULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH AND SO IN SOME WAYS PERSONALLY I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET THIS RIGHT. SO THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD- I'M WILLING TO HELP IT SOUNDS LIKE MR LACKEY AND I ARE BOTH WILLING TO TRY TO COME UP WITH BUT DO. AS CLOSE TO THE WORDING WE NEED YES LIKE I SAID- EVERYBODY USED TO HAVE A THESAURUS WILL NOW YOU NOW THERE'S AN APP WITH THE THESAURUS OR WEAKENED WE WORSE MISSED THIS TO A PLACE THAT WE CAN ALL BE COMFORTABLE AT. AND SO A BIT AS IT MOVES FORWARD WHICH I HOPE MOVES FORWARD- FIVE I WOULD LIKE TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT DISCUSSION AND IT SOUNDS LIKE BY THE STATE VICE CHAIR. OF PUBLIC SAFETY WOULD ALSO LIKE TO GIVE INPUT AND THAT'S WHERE I THINK WE GET TO A BETTER PLACE IF. SITES ARE TALKING AND LOOKING AT IT FROM THERE VIEW AND GETTING TO WHERE YOU YOU REALLY WANT IS. TO MAKE SURE WE CARRIED OUT. I MANY. BAD AND- AS POSSIBLE. SO JURORS RECOMMEND I BECAUSE I THINK WE CAN GET THERE SO THANK YOU. CALL FOR VOTE. THE BILL'S EMERGENCY ON S. B. C.

SIX IT IT IT KAMLAGER YES MISS KAMLAGER MISTER CHAIR SENATOR I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT I THESE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANTS OR SNITCHES ARE ACTUALLY INCARCERATED AND USED FOR A REASON I THINK IN PART TO KIND OF MANAGE AND CONTROL AND VERY. WHERE AUTHORITY IN LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOT WELCOME OR NOT TRUSTED WITH THESE INFORMANTS. YOU KNOW PEOPLE GENERALLY KNOW WHO THEY ARE- AND WIELD GREAT POWER. AND ACTUALLY- HAVE A LOT OF PROTECTION BECAUSE. OF THE ROLE THAT THEY PLAY IN AND SO I ACTUALLY THINK THAT THE PRACTICE IS INCREDIBLY TROUBLING THAT YOU COULD HAVE UNCORROBORATED. ALLEGATIONS USED TO EITHER. A LENGTH AND SOMEONE'S CARCERAL TIME OR DENY THEM PRIVILEGES AND CERTAIN RIGHT SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD IN THE I WANT TO RESPOND I GUESS TO SOME OF THE- COMMENTS BY THE OPPOSITION WHEN THOSE KINDS OF- DISASTROUS AND UNFORTUNATE EVENTS HAPPEN. WHERE A CORRECTIONAL OFFICER OR SOMEONE OF AUTHORITY IS ATTACKED OR HURT OR SALTED IT'S NOT JUST IT I MEAN EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THOSE KINDS OF INCIDENTS ARE RESOLVED. AND YOU KNOW- CONSEQUENCES ARE SORT OF RESULTED BUT IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE OF INFORMANTS YOU KNOW IT'S BECAUSE OF THE CULTURE THAT'S IN THAT ENVIRONMENT- THAT DOES STEP UP TO KIND OF YOU KNOW. SHED LIGHT ON THOSE KINDS OF INCIDENTS SO I WANT TO JUST SORT. ENTER THAT I WANT TO THANK YOU THIS AND I WILL BE VOTING HI. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS OR QUESTIONS. YOU MAY CLOSE CENTER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THERE WERE A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT THE DA'S RACE THAT I THINK WERE. SLIGHTLY SLIGHTLY OVER SULLINGER OVER DESCRIBING I MEAN NUMBER ONE. THE BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT THE IN CUSTODY INFORMANT'S IDENTITY HE REVEALED IN NO WAY DOES NOT DO THAT. WHAT IT REQUIRES IS THAT TO USE AN IN CUSTODY INFORMANTS. ACCUSATION IT MUST BE CORROBORATED AND INTERESTINGLY IF WE USE THE IF THE SITUATION OF FOR EXAMPLE WHERE A- INCARCERATED VIGIL MAY ATTACK A CORRECTIONS OFFICIAL OR OR COMMIT ANOTHER CRIME. WHILE THEY'RE INCARCERATED THE ONLY WAY ANY EVIDENCE THAT CAN BE USED AGAINST THEM IN A COURT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DO PROCESS IN COURT WHERE YOU'RE ONLY ALLOWED TO HAVE. CORROBOREE TESTIMONY. INTRODUCED IN CRIMINAL COURT. THIS ACTUALLY ASSIST THAT WE PROHIBIT THE USE OF UNCORROBORATED TESTIMONY DURING CRIMINAL TRIALS AND WE BARK CONVICTIONS BASED ON UNCORROBORATED INFO FROM IN CUSTODY INFORMANTS THAT'S A LOT. SO IN EFFECT BY ADDING SIMILAR DUE PROCESS PROVISIONS FOR IN CUSTODY INFORMANTS WITHIN OUR PRISONS. IT CAN ASSIST THE PROSECUTION IF THERE IS AN ACTUAL CRIME COMMITTED NOW ON THE ON THE POINT OF. WHETHER THIS DOES NOT ELIMINATE. THE ABILITY FOR IN ANOTHER FOR AN IN CUSTODY INDIVIDUAL. TO WHO TO WAIT J. COMPLAINT OR RAISE AN ISSUE OF INACTION BY ANOTHER IN CUSTODY INDIVIDUAL IT DOES NOT ELIMINATE THAT. WHAT IT DOES IS REQUIRED BEFORE IT IS PUT IN THE FILE THAT'D BE CORROBORATED. SO THAT'S PRIMARILY WHAT IT DOES AND IT'S DUE PROCESS PRINCIPLES AND I THINK THAT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER COME LONGER DRIVE REYES THE MAJOR POINTS OF WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT IN SUCH A SETTING. BECAUSE THERE COULD BE MOTIVATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN CUSTODY TO MAKE ALLEGATIONS AND SO TOO WE NEED HIM CORROBORATED FOR THEM TO BE USED AND PUT FORWARD IN A PAROLE HEARING AND THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL- AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE I POINT OUT THAT THE BILL DID PASSED WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT BOTH IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY SENATE COMMITTEE AND ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE. THANKYOU AND- BUT I JUST FIND IT INTERESTING ON BOTH YOUR BILLS. IT'S THE KIND OF THE CENTRAL THEME IS COOPERATING EVIDENCE WHETHER IT'S FOR. OR AGAINST- PEOPLE ARE INCARCERATED. AND THEN FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT IT'S JUST IT'S KIND OF THE SAME THEME SONG- OBVIOUSLY IT'S HOW DO YOU GET THERE SO THAT EVERYBODY. CAN HAVE JUST ASSISTANCE OR SUPPORTING THIS AND I THINK THE SAME HERE IF YOU SIT DOWN AND WE JUST MAKE THE GOAL OF HAVING JUSTICE AND MAKING SURE SHE IS EQUAL ON BOTH SIDES WHICH IS. WHERE I THINK YOU'RE TRYING TO GET TO- PARTICULARLY TO GET THERE. THANK YOU. SB TEN SIXTY FOR THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER HI GENSER.

RIGHT WILL BE GOOD EVENING- MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR TENSION AND ALL THEIR WORK ON THIS PARTICULAR MEASURE. I ALSO ACCEPTED MEMBERS PROPOSED BY THE CHAIR WHICH REMOVED THE FINE INCREASES IN WASTE HAULER LIABILITY. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING- THAT ACCEPTING THESE AMENDMENTS REMOVES OPPOSITION FROM THE ACLU PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE. SB FOUR OWN. HELPS LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LOCAL AGENCY STOP PROPERTY OWNERS FROM TURNING OUR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES INTO UNLICENSED AND UNREGULATED DUMPSITES. CURRENT LAW ONLY ADDRESSES SITUATIONS WHICH THE PROPERTY OWNERS DO NOT GIVE PERMISSION TO UNLAWFULLY DUMP WASTE MATTERS ON THE PROPERTY THIS CREATES A LOOPHOLE WHICH RESULTS IN MANY PROPERTY OWNERS GIVING WASTE HAULERS PERMISSION TO DUMP INDUSTRIAL WASTE ON THEIR LAND WITHOUT FIRST OBTAINING THE REQUIRED PERMITS FROM STATE COUNTY. AND LOCAL AGENCIES. PROPERTY OWNERS PROFIT FROM COLLECTING CASH WELL WASTE HAULERS PROFIT BY CHARGING BUSINESSES THE FULL COST FOR THE TRANSPORTATION OF WASTE INTENDED FOR A LICENSED DUMPSITE. AND INSTEAD DO IT DELIVERS THE WAYS TO PROPERTY OWNERS LAND FOR FAR LOWER AMOUNT OF MONEY THERE BY POCKETING THE DIFFERENCE. SB FOUR OH NINE CLOSES THIS LOOPHOLE BY DRESSING THE SITUATIONS WHICH A PROPERTY OWNER GIVES CONSENT. IN A RECENT CASE A PROSECUTOR BUT L. A. COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY WHO HELPED MY OFFICE STRAP THIS BILL A PROPERTY OWNER ACCEPTED TRUCKLOADS OF COMMERCIAL WASTE ONTO HIS PROPERTY THERE WAS LOCATED TOP OF A HILL. WELL OVER A THOUSAND CUBIC YARD OF COMMERCIAL WASTE WERE DUMPED ONTO HIS PROPERTY OP DRIVEWAY OVER THEIR OWNERS HILLSIDE. SENSORS NO PERMIT TO RECEIVE THE WASTE MOUNTAIN PILES OF COMMERCIAL WASTE WERE NEVER SECURED. THE NEIGHBOR AND HER FAMILY WERE IN DANGER BY THIS ON SECURED HILLSIDE A WASTE. COULD TUMBLE DOWN BY THE FAILURE OF THE FENDER TO OBTAIN PROPER PERMITS. I ALSO RECENTLY MET WITH I HEART LAKE LOS ANGELES A COMMUNITY THAT CLEANS UP A DUMPING. OCCURRING IN THEIR COMMUNITY ALL ALL OF YOUR MEMBER OFFICES RECEIVED A VIDEO THAT WE DID ON THIS HILL. OKAY THE SUBJECT WITHOUT I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME ERICA SCHWARTZ FROM THE I HEART MAKE L. A. N.

YEAH IT WAS I MEAN IT WAS THIS IS BILLS FROM LAST YEAR OR SO- BUT IT WASN'T IN THAT I'M SORRY- OKAY YEAH I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT TRYING TO BE SO- SO THE SO THE RITUAL BILL- MANDATED- COUNTY- AND IT'S A PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION IF YOU HAD CERTAIN CRIMES ON ANIMAL ABUSE SO NOW ALL THE BILL DOES WHICH IS STILL HELPFUL IS IT CLARIFIES LOCKERS JUDGES DO HAVE THE DISCRETION TO DO IT MANY OF THEM DO NOT KNOW THAT THEY DO. SO THIS WILL CLARIFY SO THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN DO THAT BECAUSE WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS WE WANT TO CATCH PEOPLE EARLY AND INTURN THEIR LIFE AROUND AS OPPOSED ALLOWING. THEM TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD. AND BECAUSE GREATER HARM. OKAY AND SO THAT WAS THE OTHER REASON WHY ASK THE LAST QUESTION BECAUSE WE I SAW THE ANALYSIS BUT IT DIDN'T HAVE ALL THAT YEAH MEDIA MOVEMENT-O'DONNELL. ONLY FOR A BRIEF QUESTION BUT IT WAS FROM LAST YEAR SECOND. WELL ONE OF THE COMMENTS IN THE OPPOSITION MENTIONED CANCELING SO THERE WAS A DISPUTE- THERE'S SORT OF A YEAH I WAS SPEAKING WITH A DIFFERENT ONLY TWENTY. HOUSE THINGS. EVALUATION NOW IT JUST CLARIFIES LAW THAT JUDGES CAN ASSIGN. AN EVALUATION THANK AND ALSO STILL ASSIGN COUNSELING. I DON'T THINK SO- SOME OF WHICH IS THE VALUATION YEAH IT WAS IT WAS IT WAS MUCH BROADER WHEN I LEFT THE SENATE THERE WHEN IT'S LEAVING HERE BUT- IF IT MOVES THE BALL DOWN THE FIELD ALSO I'M FINE WITH THAT. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YES R. K. WHAT IS SO I GUESS A CLARIFICATION BUILDING ON WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER COMMERCE I MEAN IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THE CURRENT LAW THERE'S MANDATORY COUNSELING FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS AND IT THIS REMOVES THAT COUNSELING. NOW YEAH I DON'T HAVE THAT RIGHT NOW. OKAY ADDITIONALLY VERY HAPPY. OKAY SO THERE'S NO CURRENT COUNTING CORRECT SO THE OPPOSITION LETTER FROM THE HUMANE SOCIETY THAT. THEY JUST WANTED TO THE COUNSELING I IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU'RE REMOVING CANCELING MAYBE I MISUNDERSTOOD. YEAH ABOUT THAT BUT NO AT THE REQUEST OF THE CHAIR SO IT WAS ORIGINALLY THE RACIAL BILL WAS COUNSELING AND VALUATION NOW WE'RE JUST DOWN TECH CLARIFYING WHAT JUDGES CAN ALREADY DO WHICH IS TO SIGN AN EVALUATION SO I GUESS I WOULD REFER BACK TO THAT LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST WHICH IS EXISTING LAW REQUIRES THE COURT TO ORDER THE DEFENDANT TO COMPLETE COUNSELING. SO CURRENT LAW DOES REQUIRE COUNSELING ACCORDING TO THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL'S DESCRIPTION. YEAH SO IF THAT'S BEING REMOVED AND IT IS ACTUALLY A NO I'M NOT NO I'M NOT REMOVING ALL IT IS CLARIFYING THAT ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION JUDGES AT THE FORTY TO DO IT SO THE DATA AND SAYS THIS BILL WOULD DELETE THE REQUIREMENT THAT A DEFENDANT GRADUATION COMPILE ALL DOUBLE CHECK THAT. BECAUSE I'M UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THAT I KNOW THAT YEAH THAT'S FINE I WILL I WILL DOUBLE CHECK AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT. CORRECT THAT WOULD GIVE ME PAUSE TO. OKAY ANY MORE QUESTIONS.
