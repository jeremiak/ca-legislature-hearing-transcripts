THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS

00:31:36.427 --> 00:31:38.363

EVERYONE HAS WEIGHED IN ON THAT.

00:39:31.402 --> 00:39:33.170
THIS BILL COMPLEX WITH THOSE

00:39:33.237 --> 00:39:34.538
EFFORTS.

00:39:34.605 --> 00:39:36.240
IF THIS BILL PASSES IT CONFLICTS

00:39:36.307 --> 00:39:37.475

00:39:43.481 --> 00:39:44.482
TO COMPETE WITH THAT.

00:39:44.548 --> 00:39:45.983

ANDA ONE OF THE EXAMPLES I WAS

00:41:56.947 --> 00:41:58.382
THINKING ABOUT.

00:41:58.449 --> 00:42:00.084
IS IF A TELECOMMUNICATIONS

THE MAIN REASON IS MY SON

01:08:31.707 --> 01:08:31.941
[inaudible]

01:08:32.007 --> 01:08:33.676
MANNY.

01:08:33.742 --> 01:08:35.211
I HE IS TWENTY YEARS OLD.

01:08:35.277 --> 01:08:36.512
HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM AND

01:08:36.579 --> 01:08:37.546
INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY AT THE

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:40.916
AGE OF THREE HI HE IS AT THE

01:08:40.983 --> 01:08:42.518
MORE SEVERE END OF THE SPECTRUM.

01:08:42.585 --> 01:08:45.488
WHERE HE HAS NONVERBAL COMBATIVE

01:08:45.554 --> 01:08:45.988
HE DOESN'T FOLLOW VERBAL

01:08:46.055 --> 01:08:47.056
COMMANDS?

01:08:47.122 --> 01:08:48.524
AND HE'S A FLIGHT RISK WITH NO

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:51.060
FEAR OF WATER HEIGHTS CARS.

01:08:51.126 --> 01:08:53.863
I HAD AND HE'S ALSO AN EPILEPTIC.

01:08:53.929 --> 01:08:55.798
AND WHILE HE LOOKS VERY HANDSOME

01:08:55.865 --> 01:08:58.300
NORMAL YOUNG MAN ON THE OUTSIDE

01:08:58.367 --> 01:08:59.902
HE IS VERY CHILD LIKE.

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:02.171
HE LOVES THINGS SUCH AS CARTOONS

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:04.373
DISNEY MOVIES DOOR THE EXPLORA

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:07.710
HE LOVES MUSIC -- NICE BOUNCY

01:09:07.776 --> 01:09:10.279
HOUSES AS BUT HE DEPENDS ON

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:12.581
SOMEONE FOR HIS DAILY LIVING

01:09:12.648 --> 01:09:13.682
TASKS AS WELL.

01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:15.851
AND IT WAS ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO

01:09:15.918 --> 01:09:17.286
WHEN HE MANAGED TO GET OUT OF MY

01:09:17.353 --> 01:09:18.587
HOUSE ONE OF MY OTHER CHILDREN

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:20.523
FORGOT TO LOCK THE GATE.

01:09:20.589 --> 01:09:22.858
AND I'M SURE YOU CAN IMAGINE AS

01:09:22.925 --> 01:09:24.260
MOST OF YOU ARE PROBABLY PARENTS.

01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:26.462
THE FEAR WHEN I REALIZED THAT HE

01:09:26.529 --> 01:09:28.631
WAS GONE.

01:09:28.697 --> 01:09:31.166
I LUCKILY FOR ME WE DID FIND IN

01:09:31.233 --> 01:09:32.568
ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTE WINDOW.

01:09:32.635 --> 01:09:34.136
WHICH FELT LIKE ETERNITY.

01:09:34.203 --> 01:09:36.205
HOWEVER WE FOUND ABOUT TWENTY

01:09:36.272 --> 01:09:37.907
FEET AWAY FROM A BRIDGE DOWN THE

01:09:37.973 --> 01:09:39.742
ROAD FROM MY HOUSE.

01:09:39.808 --> 01:09:41.810
SO IN THOSE MOMENTS AFTER

01:09:41.877 --> 01:09:43.579
GETTING HIM HOME COMING DOWN.

01:09:43.646 --> 01:09:45.180
HARD SOMEWHAT COMING DOWN.

01:09:45.247 --> 01:09:46.815
AT MY WILL STARTED SPENDING AND

01:09:46.882 --> 01:09:50.352
ALL OF MY FEARS AT THAT POINT

01:09:50.419 --> 01:09:52.154
HAD ALMOST COME TO A REALITY.

01:09:52.221 --> 01:09:53.889
I STARTED THINKING ABOUT ALL OF

01:09:53.956 --> 01:09:55.958
THE WHAT IFS WHAT IF HE HAD

01:09:56.025 --> 01:09:57.026
GOTTEN INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE

01:09:57.092 --> 01:09:58.427
BRIDGE AND SAW THE WATER BECAUSE

01:09:58.494 --> 01:09:59.695
HE LOVES TO PLAY IN WATER.

01:09:59.762 --> 01:10:01.630
HE WOULD HAVE JUMPED.

01:10:01.697 --> 01:10:03.832
AND WHAT IF HE GOT HIT BY A CAR

01:10:03.899 --> 01:10:05.000
BECAUSE HE HAS NO FEAR OF THOSE

01:10:05.067 --> 01:10:06.135
THINGS HE JUST.

01:10:06.201 --> 01:10:09.371
WALKS RIGHT OUT INTO THE STREET --

01:10:09.438 --> 01:10:11.507
ALSO ONE OF A FIRST RESPONDER IN

01:10:11.574 --> 01:10:12.841
THIS INSTANCE PRIMARILY A LAW

01:10:12.908 --> 01:10:14.443
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER WOULD HAVE

01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:16.445
COME INTO CONTACT WITH HIM.

01:10:16.512 --> 01:10:18.013
AND MISTAKEN HIS CALM NON

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:20.349
COMPLIANCE FOR JUST THAT.

01:10:20.416 --> 01:10:22.651
BUT NOT PART OF HIS DISABILITY.

01:10:22.718 --> 01:10:24.253
ON IT WAS AT THAT POINT MY WILL

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:26.021
STARTED SPENT IN AND I DECIDED I

01:10:26.088 --> 01:10:27.423
WAS NOT GOING TO SIT BY AND LET

01:10:27.489 --> 01:10:29.458

01:15:33.862 --> 01:15:35.364

01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:37.299
PRIVACY PROTECTIONS IN THE BILL

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:38.467

IS ONLY USED FOR THE PURPOSE

01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:42.871
HIGHLIGHTED IN THE BILL AND NOT

01:15:42.938 --> 01:15:45.240
USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES AND ALSO

01:15:45.307 --> 01:15:46.174
THERE'S NOT.

01:15:46.241 --> 01:15:47.910
WAYS TO ENSURE THAT THE

01:15:47.976 --> 01:15:50.078
INFORMATION SUBMITTED IS IN FACT

01:15:50.145 --> 01:15:53.515
VERIFIED AND BY THAT INDIVIDUAL

01:15:53.582 --> 01:15:57.719

01:15:57.786 --> 01:16:00.822

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.995
WE'D HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS

01:16:07.062 --> 01:16:08.430
THANK YOU.

01:16:08.497 --> 01:16:08.964
A QUESTIONS FOR COMMITTEE

01:16:09.031 --> 01:16:11.667
MEMBERS.

01:16:11.733 --> 01:16:13.902
YES -- IS CRUCIAL.

01:16:13.969 --> 01:16:15.904
HI NOT A QUESTION BUT I DO WANNA

01:16:15.971 --> 01:16:17.806
COMMEND DONE NOT ONLY THE AUTHOR

01:16:17.873 --> 01:16:20.042
BUT YEAH AMY AND HER STORY ABOUT

01:16:20.108 --> 01:16:22.411
HER SON AS IT REALLY PAINTS THE

01:16:22.477 --> 01:16:23.779
PICTURE.

01:16:23.845 --> 01:16:27.282
UP FOR MANY PARENTS AS THEY SEE

01:16:27.349 --> 01:16:29.484
THEIR CHILDREN GROW INTO DULTS

01:16:29.551 --> 01:16:30.953
AND THEY WORK ON THAT BALANCE

01:16:31.019 --> 01:16:35.290
BETWEEN INDEPENDENCE AND SAFETY.

01:16:35.357 --> 01:16:37.659
I KNOW THAT -- WE ALSO HAVE A

01:16:37.726 --> 01:16:40.162
GROWING COMMUNITY OF OCT TWO

01:16:40.228 --> 01:16:42.497
STICKS TIME -- CHILDREN AND

01:16:42.564 --> 01:16:45.834
YOUNG ADULTS AND SO THIS MEASURE --

01:16:45.901 --> 01:16:47.469
IN THE FUTURE I THINK WOULD BE

01:16:47.536 --> 01:16:49.571
ABLE TO BE EXPANDED TO APPLY TO

01:16:49.638 --> 01:16:51.907
MANY OTHERS THAT OUR

01:16:51.974 --> 01:16:54.109
PARTICULARLY AS THEY GET OLDER

01:16:54.176 --> 01:16:56.345
THE THE ONE FACT THAT REALLY.

01:16:56.411 --> 01:16:58.313
HITS HOME IS THE COMPLIANCE AS

01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:00.983
FAR AS PUBLIC SAFETY WOULD GO

01:17:01.049 --> 01:17:03.018
AND UNDERSTANDING WHO THEY MAY

01:17:03.085 --> 01:17:06.621
BE ENCOUNTERING SO THANK YOU SO

01:17:06.688 --> 01:17:08.223

01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:09.191
MR OBERNOLTE.

01:17:09.257 --> 01:17:09.891

WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY.

01:17:13.762 --> 01:17:14.963
A COUPLE CONCERNS I WANTED TO

01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:16.932
SHARE WITH YOU -- FIRST OF ALL

01:17:16.999 --> 01:17:17.899
LIKE TO ASK.

01:17:17.966 --> 01:17:20.335
WHAT'S YOUR FEELING IS ABOUT --

01:17:20.402 --> 01:17:22.504
THIS SYSTEM CREATING ADDITIONAL

01:17:22.571 --> 01:17:24.206
LIABILITY FOR FIRST RESPONDERS

01:17:24.272 --> 01:17:26.208
BECAUSE ONE OF THE CONCERNS

01:17:26.274 --> 01:17:27.376
THAT'S BEEN RAISED.

01:17:27.442 --> 01:17:29.945
IS THAT A FAILURE TO UTILIZE

01:17:30.012 --> 01:17:31.880
INFORMATION IN THE SYSTEM MIGHT

01:17:31.947 --> 01:17:33.615
CREATE LIABILITY.

01:17:33.682 --> 01:17:35.484
FOR A FIRST RESPONDER AND I

01:17:35.550 --> 01:17:36.485
THINK THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD

01:17:36.551 --> 01:17:37.886
THING TO HAVE MAYBE SOME SAFE

01:17:37.953 --> 01:17:39.888
HARBOR IN THE BILL ESPECIALLY

01:17:39.955 --> 01:17:41.656
DURING A PHASE IN PERIOD.

01:17:41.723 --> 01:17:42.424
WHEN WE GET THE SYSTEM

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:43.458
OPERATIONAL YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT

01:17:43.525 --> 01:17:45.060

TRENDS GOING INTO THE NEW SYSTEM

01:17:49.765 --> 01:17:51.533

STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE SURE WE GET

01:17:57.806 --> 01:17:59.174
THE SYSTEM RIGHT.

01:17:59.241 --> 01:18:01.777
AND AS I TALKED ABOUT IT -- I

01:18:01.843 --> 01:18:03.912
DON'T THINK PEOPLE REALIZE.

01:18:03.979 --> 01:18:05.047
THAT IN A DAY AND AGE NOT TO

01:18:05.113 --> 01:18:06.748
RESPOND -- FROM MY PREVIOUS

01:18:06.815 --> 01:18:07.315
EXPERIENCES WORKING ALBERS

INDUSTRY THERE MANY TIMES YOU

01:18:09.117 --> 01:18:10.619
GET THAT NINE ONE ONE HANG UP

01:18:10.685 --> 01:18:11.653
CALL THE QUESTRADE.

01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:13.388
TO THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM SO

01:18:13.455 --> 01:18:14.423
YOU DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A MEDICAL

01:18:14.489 --> 01:18:16.691
AID CALL IT'S A FIRE CALL OR A

01:18:16.758 --> 01:18:18.260
SAFETY ISSUE WITH PD.

01:18:18.326 --> 01:18:19.795
BUT WOULDN'T BE BETTER THAT AS

01:18:19.861 --> 01:18:21.296
REMOVING TO THIS NEXT GENERATION

01:18:21.363 --> 01:18:22.597
OF MY ONE SYSTEM.

01:18:22.664 --> 01:18:24.366
THAT WE GET ALL THAT RELEVANT

01:18:24.433 --> 01:18:25.000
INFORMATION THAT HEY YOU KNOW

01:18:25.067 --> 01:18:25.767
WHAT.

01:18:25.834 --> 01:18:26.968
THERE IS SOMEBODY THAT

01:18:27.035 --> 01:18:30.939
VOLUNTARILY -- PUT THEM SOUTH

01:18:31.006 --> 01:18:31.540
PUT THEIR INFORMATION ON THE

01:18:31.606 --> 01:18:32.340
SYSTEM SO WE KNOW.

01:18:32.407 --> 01:18:33.542
WHAT TYPE OF PERSON WE MAY COME

01:18:33.608 --> 01:18:34.643
INTO THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN

01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:35.744
THAT PERSON?

01:18:35.811 --> 01:18:37.345
THAT WASN'T ABLE TO TALK BUT WE

01:18:37.412 --> 01:18:38.380
HAVE THE MY ONE CARD THAT WE

01:18:38.447 --> 01:18:39.948
ALREADY HAVE ALL THE HELP

01:18:40.015 --> 01:18:40.715
MEDICAL INFORMATION SO WE CAN

01:18:40.782 --> 01:18:42.050
BETTER RESPOND. TO PREPARE

01:18:42.117 --> 01:18:43.485
OURSELVES ONCE WE ARRIVED ON THE

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:45.854
SCENE OF THE CALL TO PROVIDE THE

01:18:45.921 --> 01:18:47.856
BEST TREATMENT ANSWER FOR THOSE --

01:18:47.923 --> 01:18:48.490
PERSON THAT ARE EITHER SICK OR

01:18:48.557 --> 01:18:49.458
INJURED.

01:18:49.524 --> 01:18:51.359
AND IT'S KIND OF A PLACE IN A

01:18:51.426 --> 01:18:52.894
ROAD MAP TO HOW WE GET THERE BUT

01:18:52.961 --> 01:18:55.764
MAKING SURE THAT WE GET IT RIGHT

01:18:55.831 --> 01:18:56.364
FOR THE RIGHT REASONS YEAH I

01:18:56.431 --> 01:18:56.832
SOME OPEN.

01:18:56.898 --> 01:18:57.332
AND IT'S SOME OF THAT

01:18:57.399 --> 01:18:59.434
INFORMATION THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:18:59.501 --> 01:19:00.102
THE MOST CRITICAL FOR EXAMPLE IF

01:19:00.168 --> 01:19:02.003
YOU HAD A A MEDICATION ALLERGY

01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:03.038
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU VERY

01:19:03.105 --> 01:19:04.673
MUCH WANT TO FIRST RESPONDERS TO

01:19:04.739 --> 01:19:06.608
KNOW ABOUT BUT IF YOU WERE TO

01:19:06.675 --> 01:19:08.276
PUT THAT IN. TWO VIEWS A

01:19:08.343 --> 01:19:09.644
RIDICULOUS EXAMPLE THE DAY AFTER

01:19:09.711 --> 01:19:11.179
THE ROLL OUT OF THE SYSTEM AND

01:19:11.246 --> 01:19:13.348
TWO DAYS AFTER A PARAMEDIC CAME

01:19:13.415 --> 01:19:15.217
OUT DIDN'T CHECK THAT IN ITS

01:19:15.283 --> 01:19:16.318
PRESCRIBE THAT MEDICATION FOR

01:19:16.384 --> 01:19:16.685
YOU.

01:19:16.751 --> 01:19:18.286
AND YOU KNOW THAT THAT WOULD BE

01:19:18.353 --> 01:19:19.521
SOMETHING WHERE THAT MIGHT

01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:21.490
CREATE -- SOME LIABILITY AND A

01:19:21.556 --> 01:19:23.959
CAUSE OF ACTION -- FOR AGAINST

01:19:24.025 --> 01:19:25.727
THAT FIRST RESPOND OR NO MAYBE

01:19:25.794 --> 01:19:26.995
LONG TERM THAT'S APPROPRIATE BUT

01:19:27.062 --> 01:19:28.663
BUT I THINK AS WE ROLL OUT WE

01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:29.865
NEED TO BE SENSITIVE TO THAT.

01:19:29.931 --> 01:19:31.566
I'D ONE OTHER CONCERN TO SHARE

01:19:31.633 --> 01:19:33.668
WITH YOU AND AND THIS IS.

01:19:33.735 --> 01:19:34.703
NOT A CRITICISM BECAUSE I

01:19:34.769 --> 01:19:36.605
REALIZE THIS IS IN THE COMMITTEE

01:19:36.671 --> 01:19:37.772
AMENDMENTS THAT YOU WERE JUST

01:19:37.839 --> 01:19:39.007
ASKED TO TAKE SO I WAS

01:19:39.074 --> 01:19:40.275
NEGOTIATION WITH THE COMMITTEE

01:19:40.342 --> 01:19:42.043
I'M AWARE OF THAT BUT AMONGST

01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:43.812
THE PIECES OF INFORMATION YOU'RE

01:19:43.879 --> 01:19:45.814
ADDING TO THE SYSTEM IS RATE THE

01:19:45.881 --> 01:19:47.048
RACE OR ETHNICITY.

01:19:47.115 --> 01:19:49.050
AND I KNOW WE'RE ALL AWARE OF

01:19:49.117 --> 01:19:50.118
THE EFFORTS THAT WE'VE MADE

01:19:50.185 --> 01:19:51.820
RECENTLY IN THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:19:51.887 --> 01:19:54.422
TRY AND ROOT OUT RACISM IN.

01:19:54.489 --> 01:19:56.591
A LAW ENFORCEMENT -- WE

01:19:56.658 --> 01:19:57.459
CERTAINLY WOULDN'T WANT TO

01:19:57.526 --> 01:19:58.727
CREATE A NEW SOURCE OF

01:19:58.793 --> 01:20:00.128
INFORMATION THAT COULD BE USED

01:20:00.195 --> 01:20:06.835
TO PERPETUATE RACISM.

01:20:06.902 --> 01:20:08.236
AND I I JUST.

01:20:08.303 --> 01:20:09.571
WHAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE SENSITIVE

01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:09.971
TO THAT BECAUSE?

01:20:10.038 --> 01:20:10.639
THE HOUSE THE BILL MOVES FORWARD

01:20:10.705 --> 01:20:11.206
I I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S

01:20:11.273 --> 01:20:11.873
INFORMATION THAT WE WANT PEOPLE

01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:12.507
TO BE AWARE OF BEFORE THEY SHOW

01:20:12.574 --> 01:20:12.908
UP AT THE EVENT.

01:20:12.974 --> 01:20:13.909
AND I THINK THAT'S JUST.

01:20:13.975 --> 01:20:15.243
GIVE THE FIRST RESPONDERS A

01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:16.077
BETTER IDEA OF THE TYPE OF

01:20:16.144 --> 01:20:17.646
PERSON THE LOOKING FOR RIGHT AS

01:20:17.712 --> 01:20:18.980
WE LOOK AT THE RACE AND THINGS

01:20:19.047 --> 01:20:20.649
OF THAT NATURE I'M NOT ENOUGH OF

01:20:20.715 --> 01:20:21.816
IT UNDER CENTER INTENSE CRYING I

01:20:21.883 --> 01:20:23.185
MEAN AND AND I WOULD HATE TO PUT

01:20:23.251 --> 01:20:24.352
THE ONUS ON THE OTHER BECAUSE WE

01:20:24.419 --> 01:20:24.686
DID.

01:20:24.753 --> 01:20:25.820
A SUGGEST THE AMENDMENTS THAT

01:20:25.887 --> 01:20:27.122
THAT'S WHY AND THE AND THE

01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:29.391
AUTHORS ACCEPTED THEM -- I WOULD

01:20:29.457 --> 01:20:31.193
ECHO WHAT THE AUTHOR SAID NUMBER

01:20:31.259 --> 01:20:31.826
ONE AND NUMBER TWO DARLING WHICH

01:20:31.893 --> 01:20:33.628
BEARS -- AND TO THE DEGREE THAT

01:20:33.695 --> 01:20:35.630
WE'RE COLLECTING INFORMATION IT

01:20:35.697 --> 01:20:36.164
WOULD BE IMPORTANT A FIRST

01:20:36.231 --> 01:20:39.034
RESPONDER -- SHOWS UP -- A GOOD

01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:40.969
EXAMPLE MY PARENTS AND AND THEY

01:20:41.036 --> 01:20:42.704
DON'T HAVE GOOD GOOD -- A GOOD

01:20:42.771 --> 01:20:44.239
GRASP OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE

01:20:44.306 --> 01:20:45.440
THAT THAT THE PERSON WOULD HAVE

01:20:45.507 --> 01:20:46.641
TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN WE'RE

01:20:46.708 --> 01:20:48.009
SPEAKING TO THIS PERSON THAT ARE

01:20:48.076 --> 01:20:48.944
WALKING AND IF THE IF THERE

01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:50.312
ISN'T A RESPONSE TO THE WRIST

01:20:50.378 --> 01:20:51.580
THE LACK OF RESPONSE MIGHT

01:20:51.646 --> 01:20:53.014
IMMEDIATELY BE.

01:20:53.081 --> 01:20:53.815
THE FACT THAT THERE MAY BE A

01:20:53.882 --> 01:20:55.317
LANGUAGE BARRIER AS OPPOSED AND

01:20:55.383 --> 01:20:56.184
THAT WHICH IS VERY CERTAINLY I

01:20:56.251 --> 01:20:58.320
COULD SEE FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE --

01:20:58.386 --> 01:21:00.455
WHAT WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN

01:21:00.522 --> 01:21:01.356
THAT IN THE AMENDMENTS THAT THAT

01:21:01.423 --> 01:21:02.991
WAS NOT THE INTENT THE INTENT

01:21:03.058 --> 01:21:04.292
WAS SOMETHING ELSE OKAY WELL?

01:21:04.359 --> 01:21:07.829
THEN PERHAPS WE SHOULD RENAME

01:21:07.896 --> 01:21:09.798
THAT LANGUAGE -- BUT WHAT WHAT

01:21:09.864 --> 01:21:10.432
I'M TRYING TO AVOID IS I MEAN

01:21:10.498 --> 01:21:11.466
GOD FOR BID WE HAVE ANY.

01:21:11.533 --> 01:21:13.235
FIRST RESPONDERS THAT WOULD LOOK

01:21:13.301 --> 01:21:15.136
AT SOMEONE'S RACE AND BE LESS

01:21:15.203 --> 01:21:16.571
LIKELY TO RESPOND TO PROVIDE

01:21:16.638 --> 01:21:18.106
ACCURATE SERVICE I HOPE THAT

01:21:18.173 --> 01:21:19.274
THERE'S NO ONE IN CALIFORNIA

01:21:19.341 --> 01:21:20.408
THAT COULD BE TRUE UP -- IF

01:21:20.475 --> 01:21:22.043
THERE IS THOUGH I WOULD HATE TO
