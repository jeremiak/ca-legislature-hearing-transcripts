01:04:42.578 --> 01:04:44.547
IT'S SAD THAT THESE OCCASIONS

POORER THAN LIFE AND OVER THE

01:04:47.283 --> 01:04:51.654
COURSE OF HISTORY. A LONG HALF.

03:56:57.136 --> 03:56:59.605
THAT'S RECEIVED A PINK SLIP. AS

03:56:59.672 --> 03:57:00.339
THE ONLY MEMBER OF THIS BODY

03:57:00.406 --> 03:57:02.041
HAD THAT HAS GIVEN PINK SLIPS

03:57:02.107 --> 03:57:04.143
ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE SIDE. I

03:57:04.209 --> 03:57:06.278
DO BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WILL

03:57:06.345 --> 03:57:08.781
HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. I

03:57:08.847 --> 03:57:11.817
REMEMBER HOW DRAMATIC IT IS.

03:57:11.884 --> 03:57:14.186
EVERY MARCH FIFTEENTH WHEN YOU

03:57:14.253 --> 03:57:16.288
ARE PAYING SLIPPED. THE

03:57:16.355 --> 03:57:17.856
DEPRESSION THAT COMES UPON YOUR

03:57:17.923 --> 03:57:20.192
SCHOOL COMMUNITY. HOW TEACHERS

03:57:20.259 --> 03:57:21.994
ARE WALKING AROUND SAD WITH

03:57:22.061 --> 03:57:24.029
LONG FACES AND THERE'S NOTHING

03:57:24.096 --> 03:57:26.298
YOU CAN DO AS A TEACHER

03:57:26.365 --> 03:57:28.400
SUPPORTING OTHER TEACHERS. AND

03:57:28.467 --> 03:57:29.568
AS AN ADMINISTRATOR TRYING TO

03:57:29.635 --> 03:57:32.438
SUPPORT YOUR TEACHERS IT IS

03:57:32.504 --> 03:57:33.038
SOMETHING THAT'S NOT EASY FOR

03:57:33.105 --> 03:57:35.474
ANYONE. AND I DON'T OPPOSE

03:57:35.541 --> 03:57:36.809
ANYTHING IN THIS BILL IN TERMS

03:57:36.875 --> 03:57:38.777
OF EQUITY I THINK THAT

03:57:38.844 --> 03:57:39.345
CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES SHOULD

03:57:39.411 --> 03:57:41.413
HAVE THAT EQUITY. WHAT I TAKE

03:57:41.480 --> 03:57:42.948
ISSUE WITH THIS BUT NOTICE

03:57:43.015 --> 03:57:45.618
DATE. I THINK MARCH FIFTEENTH

03:57:45.684 --> 03:57:47.953
IS SO EARLY TO TRY AND NOTICE

03:57:48.020 --> 03:57:50.923
PEOPLE. ESPECIALLY AT A TIME

03:57:50.990 --> 03:57:51.490
WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS DON'T

03:57:51.557 --> 03:57:53.225
KNOW WHAT THEIR BUDGET IS. WHAT

03:57:53.292 --> 03:57:55.060
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE

03:57:55.127 --> 03:57:57.429
ENCOURAGEMENT OF OVER THANKS

03:57:57.496 --> 03:57:59.198
FOR LETTING PEOPLE. AND THOSE

03:57:59.264 --> 03:58:01.367
FAMILIES THAT REALLY DEPEND ON

03:58:01.433 --> 03:58:04.236
THIS. JOB TO PULL THROUGH THIS

03:58:04.303 --> 03:58:06.472
EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER. THAT

03:58:06.538 --> 03:58:08.674
I'VE HAD TO ENTER AS A TEACHER

03:58:08.741 --> 03:58:10.909
I HAVE. HOLD A LOT OF MY

03:58:10.976 --> 03:58:13.012
CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES. AS WELL

03:58:13.078 --> 03:58:14.880
AS TEACHERS JUST TO GET THEIR

03:58:14.947 --> 03:58:17.549
INPUT. BECAUSE I KNOW THAT I'VE

03:58:17.616 --> 03:58:18.550
BEEN OUT OF THE CLASSROOM FOR A

03:58:18.617 --> 03:58:20.886
FEW YEARS JUST TO SEE WHERE

03:58:20.953 --> 03:58:22.755
THEY STAND AND HOW THEY FEEL.

03:58:22.821 --> 03:58:24.823
AND THEY WOULD ALSO LIKE TO

03:58:24.890 --> 03:58:26.992
SEE. THE DAY JUST BE PUSHED A

03:58:27.059 --> 03:58:28.460
LITTLE FURTHER I KNOW THAT THE

03:58:28.527 --> 03:58:30.796
DATE I BELIEVE IT WAS MARCH WAS

03:58:30.863 --> 03:58:33.599
OFFERED AND WAS REJECTED. AND

03:58:33.666 --> 03:58:35.401
FOR ME HAVING A DISTRICT THAT

03:58:35.467 --> 03:58:36.368
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THEIR BUDGET

03:58:36.435 --> 03:58:38.837
IS IT'S JUST GOING TO ENCOURAGE

03:58:38.904 --> 03:58:40.339
THE OVERPAYING SLIPPING OF OUR

03:58:40.406 --> 03:58:41.674
TEACHERS I'M SORRY ARE ARE

03:58:41.740 --> 03:58:43.876
CLASSIFIED. AND IT'S NOT AN

03:58:43.942 --> 03:58:46.779
EASY THING TO DO. NOT IN MARCH

03:58:46.845 --> 03:58:48.113
FIFTEEN WE USED TO HAVE THREE

03:58:48.180 --> 03:58:49.982
POTENTIAL THREE MONTHS TO GOAL.

03:58:50.049 --> 03:58:51.550
AND OUR CHILDREN ARE DEPENDING

03:58:51.617 --> 03:58:52.618
ON THESE TEACHERS AND

03:58:52.685 --> 03:58:54.053
CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES TO CARRY

03:58:54.119 --> 03:58:54.887
THEM THROUGH THE END OF THE

03:58:54.953 --> 03:58:57.122
YEAR. AGAIN I'M IN COMPLETE

03:58:57.189 --> 03:58:59.458
SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IF THE

03:58:59.525 --> 03:59:02.027
DATE WOULD BE MAY. AT LEAST ONE

03:59:02.094 --> 03:59:03.529
A MAY REVISE COMES AROUND SO

03:59:03.595 --> 03:59:06.031
YOU'RE NOT AGAIN. GIVEN THESE

03:59:06.098 --> 03:59:09.368
PINK SLIPS JUST BECAUSE THE

03:59:09.435 --> 03:59:11.136
DISTRICT HAS TO PROTECT ITSELF.

03:59:11.203 --> 03:59:13.005
TO US IT MAY BE EASY BUT

03:59:13.072 --> 03:59:15.541
SOMEONE LOCAL. I. LOW WAGE

03:59:15.607 --> 03:59:17.509
EARNER IN OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR

03:59:17.576 --> 03:59:19.144
SCHOOL COMMUNITY THEY HAVE TO

03:59:19.211 --> 03:59:20.446
DEAL WITH THIS EVERY YEAR JUST

03:59:20.512 --> 03:59:22.281
BECAUSE WE SET UP THE SYSTEM.

03:59:22.347 --> 03:59:23.749
WHERE THEY NEED TO BE NOTIFIED

03:59:23.816 --> 03:59:24.850
I THINK IT REALLY IS

03:59:24.917 --> 03:59:26.885
HEARTBREAKING. AND I JUST FEEL

03:59:26.952 --> 03:59:28.887
THAT I DON'T WANT TO PUT. OUR

03:59:28.954 --> 03:59:30.889
CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES AND THE

03:59:30.956 --> 03:59:32.491
EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER THAT I

03:59:32.558 --> 03:59:35.728
HAD TO ENTER. AS A TEACHER. AND

03:59:35.794 --> 03:59:36.962
I THINK WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

03:59:37.029 --> 03:59:38.664
GIVE. THE DISTRICT A LITTLE

03:59:38.731 --> 03:59:41.300
MORE TIME SO THEY'RE NOT JUST

03:59:41.366 --> 03:59:42.468
OVERPAYING FLIPPING. THAT THEY

03:59:42.534 --> 03:59:43.569
KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE

03:59:43.635 --> 03:59:44.303
GOING TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THESE

03:59:44.369 --> 03:59:47.206
EMPLOYEES. BUT I WILL BE VERY

03:59:47.272 --> 03:59:50.142
CLEAR I AGREE WITH EVERY. PIECE

03:59:50.209 --> 03:59:52.444
OF. SECTIONS IN THESE IN THIS

03:59:52.511 --> 03:59:54.613

IF WE CALL THEM JOBS AND-

04:00:12.030 --> 04:00:16.235
200-012-2000 THIRTEEN. I WAS UP

04:00:16.301 --> 04:00:16.769
BATTLING THE HOLES OF THIS

04:00:16.835 --> 04:00:20.839
PLACE- MEETING WITH PEOPLE TO.

04:00:20.906 --> 04:00:22.574
TRY TO BUT JUST WHAT MY

04:00:22.641 --> 04:00:23.942
COLLEAGUE JUST SPOKE ABOUT

04:00:24.009 --> 04:00:26.211
WHICH IS THE ARTIFICIAL DATE OF

04:00:26.278 --> 04:00:28.814
MARCH AT WHICH POINT SCHOOL

04:00:28.881 --> 04:00:31.283
BOARDS DISTRICTS. AND OTHERS

04:00:31.350 --> 04:00:33.652
HAVE TO PROVIDE THAT PINK SLIP

04:00:33.719 --> 04:00:35.821
TO TEACHERS SORT OF ARTIFICIAL

04:00:35.888 --> 04:00:36.889
IN THE SENSE THAT WE DON'T

04:00:36.955 --> 04:00:37.890
REALLY KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO

04:00:37.956 --> 04:00:38.924
HAPPEN BUT WE'RE TELLING YOU

04:00:38.991 --> 04:00:39.825

BUT- YOU MAY NOT BE BUT YOU

04:00:42.060 --> 04:00:44.062
KNOW. IT'LL BE AWHILE BEFORE WE

04:00:44.129 --> 04:00:46.832
FIGURED OUT. WE WERE

04:00:46.899 --> 04:00:48.567
UNSUCCESSFUL IN TRYING TO BRING

04:00:48.634 --> 04:00:51.937
ABOUT REFORM. OBVIOUSLY SOME

04:00:52.004 --> 04:00:54.039
DON'T WANT REFORM AND THAT'S

04:00:54.106 --> 04:00:55.874
FINE BUT IN LOOKING AT THIS

04:00:55.941 --> 04:00:57.442
BILL I'M SORT OF CONFLICTED

04:00:57.509 --> 04:00:59.411
BECAUSE I DO AGREE THAT THE

04:00:59.478 --> 04:01:01.680
MARCH DATE NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTED

04:01:01.747 --> 04:01:03.115
AND PUTS A BURDEN ON OUR SCHOOL

04:01:03.182 --> 04:01:04.483
DISTRICTS IN OUR SCHOOL BOARDS

04:01:04.550 --> 04:01:06.885
AROUND THE STATE- I HAVEN'T

04:01:06.952 --> 04:01:07.753
THOUGHT THROUGH WHAT THE

04:01:07.820 --> 04:01:09.087
VARIOUS ISSUES ARE I'M SURE

04:01:09.154 --> 04:01:10.589
THEY'RE MANY AND I'M SURE IF WE

04:01:10.656 --> 04:01:12.858
EVER GET AROUND TO IT HERE. WE

04:01:12.925 --> 04:01:15.527
WILL EXPLORE THOSE FULLY. BUT

04:01:15.594 --> 04:01:17.830
WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT THE

04:01:17.896 --> 04:01:20.465
EMPLOYEES THAT ARE NOT TEACHERS

04:01:20.532 --> 04:01:22.701
AND ADMINISTRATORS. DON'T HAVE

04:01:22.768 --> 04:01:24.269
THE PROTECTIONS THAT ARE

04:01:24.336 --> 04:01:26.305
CURRENTLY BUILT INTO THE LAW.

04:01:26.371 --> 04:01:28.273
HOWEVER ARTIFICIAL THAT DATE IS

04:01:28.340 --> 04:01:30.375
THEY DON'T GET THE PINK SLIP

04:01:30.442 --> 04:01:33.078
WITH PLENTY OF NOTICE. HOWEVER

04:01:33.145 --> 04:01:34.680
DEPRESSING THAT MAY BE AN

04:01:34.746 --> 04:01:37.883
UPSETTING. THEY ALSO HAVE

04:01:37.950 --> 04:01:40.719
HEARING RIGHTS AS I RECALL AS

04:01:40.786 --> 04:01:44.356
PART OF THE PROCESS AN HOUR.

04:01:44.423 --> 04:01:45.824
OTHER NON TEACHER NOT

04:01:45.891 --> 04:01:47.593
ADMINISTRATOR EMPLOYEES HAVE NO

04:01:47.659 --> 04:01:49.995
HEARING RIGHTS AND SO WHAT

04:01:50.062 --> 04:01:51.063
BOTHERS ME ABOUT THE CURRENT

04:01:51.129 --> 04:01:53.432
SYSTEM IS THAT IT'S COMPLETELY

04:01:53.498 --> 04:01:55.834
INEQUITABLE. AND CERTAINLY THE

04:01:55.901 --> 04:01:57.836
LOWEST PAID. AMONG THE HARDEST

04:01:57.903 --> 04:02:00.539
WORKING. WE'RE CERTAINLY

04:02:00.606 --> 04:02:02.441
WORKING AS HARD AS THE OTHER

04:02:02.507 --> 04:02:03.842
EMPLOYEES IN OUR SCHOOL

04:02:03.909 --> 04:02:05.677
DISTRICTS AROUND THE STATE ARE

04:02:05.744 --> 04:02:07.579
THESE OTHER EMPLOYEES AND WHY

04:02:07.646 --> 04:02:09.615
NOT PROVIDE THEM THE SAME

04:02:09.681 --> 04:02:11.383
PROTECTION THAT WE PROVIDE THE

04:02:11.450 --> 04:02:13.318
TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS AND

04:02:13.385 --> 04:02:14.620
IF THE DATE NEEDS TO BE

04:02:14.686 --> 04:02:16.288
ADJUSTED BECAUSE IT'S

04:02:16.355 --> 04:02:18.423
ARTIFICIAL ROOT CAUSES PEOPLE

04:02:18.490 --> 04:02:21.193
TO BE UPSET OR DEPRESSED AS IT

04:02:21.260 --> 04:02:22.928
WOULD. AND SHOULD I'M SURE.

04:02:22.995 --> 04:02:25.697
THEN LET'S DO THAT BUT I HAVE

04:02:25.764 --> 04:02:28.734
DECIDED EVEN THOUGH I WAS. CORN

04:02:28.800 --> 04:02:30.302
I'VE DECIDED TO COME DOWN IN

04:02:30.369 --> 04:02:32.471
FAVOR OF SUPPORT OF THIS BILL

04:02:32.537 --> 04:02:33.805
TO PROVIDE PROTECTIONS FOR

04:02:33.872 --> 04:02:36.408
THOSE WHO WORK VERY VERY HARD

04:02:36.475 --> 04:02:37.542
ENTER AT THE LOWER END OF THE

04:02:37.609 --> 04:02:39.478
PAY SCALE IN JUST ABOUT EVERY

04:02:39.544 --> 04:02:41.580
IF NOT EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN

04:02:41.647 --> 04:02:42.581
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK

04:02:42.648 --> 04:02:44.549

MEMBERS I. I RISE TO- TO JOIN

04:02:55.627 --> 04:02:57.296
IN THE- THE ARTICULATE COMMENTS

04:02:57.362 --> 04:02:58.430
FROM THE SENATOR FROM LOS

04:02:58.497 --> 04:03:00.666
ANGELES WHO SPOKE EARLIER. ON

04:03:00.732 --> 04:03:02.000
ISSUES LIKE THIS HAVING EACH OF

04:03:02.067 --> 04:03:03.435
US I THINK TRY TO PUT OURSELVES

04:03:03.502 --> 04:03:05.570
IN THE PLACE. OF THE EMPLOYEE

04:03:05.637 --> 04:03:06.772
IN THIS CASE THE CLASSIFIED

04:03:06.838 --> 04:03:08.240
EMPLOYEE AND IT WOULD THIS IS

04:03:08.307 --> 04:03:10.976
HAPPENING TO ME- WOULD I WANT

04:03:11.043 --> 04:03:12.678
TO HAVE THIS NOTICE AND

04:03:12.744 --> 04:03:15.981
CERTAINLY THE ANSWER IS YES-

04:03:16.048 --> 04:03:17.015
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND YOU THINK

04:03:17.082 --> 04:03:18.216
ABOUT IT FROM A SCHOOL BOARD

04:03:18.283 --> 04:03:19.618
MEMBER AND MANY MEMBERS ON THE

04:03:19.685 --> 04:03:20.419
FLOOR HAD BEEN SCHOOL BOARD

04:03:20.485 --> 04:03:22.120
MEMBERS. AND YOU THINK ABOUT

04:03:22.187 --> 04:03:23.822
THE DILEMMA THEY FACE WHEN THEY

04:03:23.889 --> 04:03:24.423
DON'T EVEN HAVE THEIR BUDGET

04:03:24.489 --> 04:03:26.858
YET UNTIL. JULY FIRST AND

04:03:26.925 --> 04:03:27.659
THEY'RE FORCED TO MAKE A

04:03:27.726 --> 04:03:29.494
CHOICE. THAT WE'VE GOT TO GIVE

04:03:29.561 --> 04:03:31.863
NOTICE IN MARCH FOR SOMETHING

04:03:31.930 --> 04:03:32.998
IN WHICH IT'S SO DIFFICULT TO

04:03:33.065 --> 04:03:35.300
HAVE. A REAL UNDERSTANDING OF

04:03:35.367 --> 04:03:37.336
THAT BUDGET. AND SO FOR ME I

04:03:37.402 --> 04:03:38.937
WANT AT LEAST EXPLAIN WHY THE-

04:03:39.004 --> 04:03:39.805
TODAY DID NOT SUPPORT THIS

04:03:39.871 --> 04:03:41.473
BILL. IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T

04:03:41.540 --> 04:03:42.908
THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME

04:03:42.975 --> 04:03:44.609
PROTECTIONS FOR EMPLOYEES.

04:03:44.676 --> 04:03:45.711
WHETHER IT'S TEACHERS OR

04:03:45.777 --> 04:03:46.845
CLASSIFIED STAFF ANDI THINK

04:03:46.912 --> 04:03:49.081
THAT. IF THIS BILL IS SO CLOSE

04:03:49.147 --> 04:03:50.615
TO BEING WHERE IT SHOULD BE.

04:03:50.682 --> 04:03:52.217
BUT THE DATE I THINK IS TO

04:03:52.284 --> 04:03:53.652
REJECT THEM DOES IT MEAN WE

EVERYONE I'M OPEN TO THAT I

04:03:57.022 --> 04:03:58.156
THINK THAT. WE HAVE TO BE

04:03:58.223 --> 04:03:59.524
REALITIC AND WE DON'T WANT TO

04:03:59.591 --> 04:04:00.759
CREATE THESE MORALE PROBLEMS

04:04:00.826 --> 04:04:02.694
WHICH CURRENT LAW DOES PROVIDE.

04:04:02.761 --> 04:04:03.662
FOR THE SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS

04:04:03.729 --> 04:04:05.797
WHO HAVE TO BE FORCED TO. GIVE

04:04:05.864 --> 04:04:07.432
THESE NOTICES AND TO THE

04:04:07.499 --> 04:04:08.667

04:04:08.734 --> 04:04:10.168
CASE. OF THIS BILL THE

04:04:12.437 --> 04:04:13.538
THAT SORT OF MORALE PROBLEM

04:04:13.605 --> 04:04:15.941
BECAUSE- THEY'RE GOING TO THE

04:04:16.008 --> 04:04:17.175
SCHOOL BOARD'S GONNA ERR ON THE

04:04:17.242 --> 04:04:19.444
SIDE. OF HAVING TO PROTECT THE

04:04:19.511 --> 04:04:20.979
DISTRICT WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE

04:04:21.046 --> 04:04:21.580
TO SEND OUT MORE NOTICES THAT

04:04:21.646 --> 04:04:23.949
IS REQUIRED. SO THAT THIS BILL

04:04:24.016 --> 04:04:25.851
HAS THE BEST OF INTENTIONS. I

04:04:25.917 --> 04:04:27.386

04:04:27.452 --> 04:04:29.654
ARGUMENT. FOR CLASSIFIED

04:04:29.721 --> 04:04:32.057

EARLY DAY. BUT THE INTENT AND

04:06:22.767 --> 04:06:25.904
PURPOSE. AND MEANING OF THIS

04:06:25.971 --> 04:06:28.707
MEASURE BEFORE US TODAY. IS NOT

04:06:28.773 --> 04:06:30.142
ABOUT WHETHER THE DATE SHOULD

BE CHANGED OR NOT CHANGED. BUT

04:06:32.244 --> 04:06:34.279
I THINK AS WAS INDICATED BY THE

SENATOR FROM GENERAL FROM

THE SAME RIGHTS I THINK THAT

04:06:42.754 --> 04:06:46.525
THE- SCHOOLS ARE AN ORGANISM OF

04:06:46.591 --> 04:06:48.960
PEOPLE FROM ALL DIFFERENT JOBS

EXTENT THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE

04:07:08.547 --> 04:07:10.315
TREATED EQUALLY AND FAIRLY BUT

04:07:10.382 --> 04:07:11.917
THESE HARD WORKERS SHOULD BE IN

04:07:11.983 --> 04:07:13.618
A POSITION THAT THEY'RE NOT

04:07:13.685 --> 04:07:15.587
TREATED IN A DIFFERENT MANNER.

04:07:15.654 --> 04:07:17.556
TO ME IS THE ESSENCE OF WHAT

04:07:17.622 --> 04:07:18.690
