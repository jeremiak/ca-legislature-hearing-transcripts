WHAT WAS SANCTIONED BY THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE AND BEGAN ON APRIL TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN FIFTEEN WHAT'S THE FIRST STATE SPONSORED GENOCIDE IN MODERN TIMES. IT RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF ONE POINT FIVE MILLION VICTIMS MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN ALL HORRIBLY KILLED. ENTIRE COMMUNITIES WERE FORCIBLY MARCHED TO THEIR DEATHS WERE MURDERED IN ATTEMPT TO GET RACE THEIR PRESENCE FROM A REGION THEY HAD PEACEFULLY RESIDED IN FOR OVER FOUR THOUSAND YEARS.

FORMALLY REAFFIRMING CALIFORNIA'S RECOGNITION OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE. AND DESIGNATED THE MONTH OF APRIL FOURTH COMMEMORATION. HUNDRED SIX YEARS AGO ONE POINT FIVE MILLION ARMENIANS AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ASSYRIANS GREEKS AND OTHER CHRISTIANS WERE PERSECUTED AND KILLED AT THE HANDS OF THE OTTOMAN TURKS. THE ARMENIAN DIASPORA WAS LARGELY FORMED A RESULT AS A RESULT OF THE GENOCIDE TODAY CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO A LARGE AND VIBRANT ARMENIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY THAT CONTRIBUTES TO OUR RICH CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND WHO ARE THE DESCENDANTS OF THE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION LOST DURING THE GENOCIDE. SADLY LAST YEAR HATE CRIMES AGAINST AREN'T THE ARMENIAN COMMUNITY REPORTED IN OUR GREAT STATE. THE KGV ARMENIAN SCHOOL WAS VANDALIZED AND SHOTS WERE FIRED AT THE SCHOOLS BUILDING. SIMILAR INCIDENTS INVOLVED RACIALLY CHARGED ANTI ARMENIAN VANDALISM TOOK PLACE IN LOS ANGELES THE PREVIOUS YEAR FORCING THE ARMENIAN FAMILIES TO BE ON HIGH ALERT. FOR CALIFORNIANS AND BECAUSE OF THOSE RECENT ACTS OF HATE THE STATEMENT BY PRESIDENT BIDEN ON SATURDAY RECOGNIZING THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE IS HISTORIC. IMPORTANT AND WELCOME. PERMISSION TO READ THE PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT PERMISSION GRANTED THANK YOU THANK YOU. FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN EACH YEAR ON THIS DAY WE REMEMBER THE LIVES OF ALL THOSE WHO DIED IN THE OTTOMAN ERROR ARMENIAN GENOCIDE AND RECOMMIT OURSELVES TO PREVENTING SUCH AN ATROCITY FROM EVER OCCURRING AGAIN. BEGINNING ON APRIL TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN FIFTEEN WITH THE ARREST OF ARMENIAN INTELLECTUALS AND COMMUNITY LEADERS IN CONSTANTINOPLE BY THE OUR AUTOMATIC PARTIES ONE AND A HALF MILLION ARMENIANS WERE DEPORTED MASSACRED OR MARCHED TO THEIR DEATHS IN A CAMPAIGN OF EXTERMINATION. WE HONOR THE VICTIMS OF MEDS YET AND SO THAT THE HORRORS OF WHAT HAPPENED ARE NEVER LOST TO HISTORY. AND WE REMEMBER SO THAT WE REMAIN EVER VIGILANT AGAINST THE CORROSIVE INFLUENCE OF HATE IN ALL OF ITS FORMS. OF THOSE WHO MOST WERE FORCED TO FIND NEW HOMES AND NEW LIVES AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING IN THE UNITED STATES. WITH STRENGTH AND RESILIENCE THE ARMENIAN PEOPLE SURVIVED AND REBUILT THEIR COMMUNITY. OVER THE DECADES ARMENIAN IMMIGRANTS SEVEN RICH THE UNITED STATES IN COUNTLESS WAYS BUT THEY HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN THE TRAGIC HISTORY THAT BROUGHT SO MANY OF THEIR ANCESTORS TO OUR SHORES. WE HONOR THEIR STORY WE SEE THAT PAIN WE AFFIRM THAT HISTORY WE DO THIS NOT TO CAST BLAME BUT TO ENSURE THAT WHAT HAPPENED IS NEVER REPEATED. TODAY AS WE MOURN WHAT WAS LOST LET US ALSO TURN OUR EYES TO THE FUTURE FOR THE WORLD THAT WE WISH TO BUILD FOR OUR CHILDREN. THE WORLD UNST UNSTAINED BY THE DAILY EVILS OF BIGOTRY AND INTOLERANCE WERE UMAN RIGHTS ARE RESPECTED AND WHERE ALL PEOPLE ARE ARE ABLE TO PURSUE THEIR LIVES IN DIGNITY AND SECURITY. LET US RENEW OUR SHARED RESOLVE TO PRESENT TO PREVENT FUTURE ATROCITIES FROM OCCURRING ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD AND THAT'S PURSUE HEALING AND RECONCILIATION. FOR ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD. AMERICAN PEOPLE HONOR ALL THOSE ARMENIANS WHO PERISHED IN THE GENOCIDE THAT BEGAN A HUNDRED AND SIX YEARS AGO TODAY. PRESIDENT JOSEPH R. BIDEN. ONE MIGHT ASK WHY THE EVENTS OF A HUNDRED SIX YEARS AGO BEAR MENTIONING. AND RETELLING TODAY. BECAUSE WE MAY BE A CENTURY REMOVED FROM THE GENOCIDE BUT WE CONTINUE TO BE CONFRONTED WITH THE EFFORTS PROVIDE TO DRIVE ARMENIANS FROM THEIR HOMELANDS. LAST SEPTEMBER AZERBAIJAN WITH THE HELP OF TURKEY LAUNCHED AN UNPROVOKED ATTACK ON ARMENIANS IN ARTSAKH. OVER A HUNDRED AND FIVE YEARS AFTER THE GENOCIDE THE CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN OF GENOCIDE SURVIVORS FACED ANOTHER EXISTENTIAL TRACK CORRECT. NEARLY FIVE THOUSAND ARMENIANS WERE KILLED AND THOUSANDS OF OTHERS DISPLACED FROM THEIR HOMES AND THE LAND OF THEIR ANCESTORS DURING THE SECOND ARTSAKH WAR. ARMENIA HAS FULFILLED ITS OBLIGATION OF THE PEACE AGREEMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT OF AZERBAIJAN CONTINUES TO RIP MISREPRESENT THE STATUS OF P. O. W.'S IN AN ATTEMPT TO JUSTIFY CONTINUED ACT CAPTIVITY. TO THIS DATE TWO HUNDRED ARMENIAN DETAINEES REMAIN IN AZERBAIJANI CUSTODY AMONG THEM CIVILIANS. DURING MY LAST TRIP TO ARTSAKH IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. I MET A BRIDE AND GROOM ON THEIR WEDDING DAY AT A BEAUTIFUL NINETEENTH CENTURY CATHEDRAL IN THE CITY OF SHUSHI. SHUSHI TODAY IS UNDER AZERBAIJANI CONTROL AND THE CATHEDRAL. HAS BEEN DAMAGED. SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE HOW THE REGION OF ARTSAKH PEOPLE THAT I HAD LUNCH WITH WERE WOUNDED AND ONE WAS KILLED. THAT'S WHY. WE RECOGNIZE TODAY. TURKEY AND AZERBAIJAN MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE GENOCIDE AND THEIR CURRENT AGGRESSION. ATROCITIES FROM OVER A CENTURY AGO MUST BE RECOGNIZE NOW TO HELP PREVENT THE REOCCURRENCE IN THE FUTURE. AND TO HELP A COMMUNITY TRY TO HEAL. MANY ARMENIANS HAVE EXHIBITED INSPIRED THEIR COMPATRIOTS WITH THE PHRASE OF REASSURANCE. HELLO COOPER DE LEÃ³N I'M AN INCH LOVE HEY WE KNOW WHO. SENATORS IN HONOR OF THE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION ARMENIANS THAT PERISHED AND EVERY CALIFORNIA FAMILY AFFECTED BY THE ARTSAKH WAR I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU JOIN ME IN APPROPRIATELY CASTING AN AYE VOTE FOR SR TWENTY NINE. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS OSTEOBLAST WATER NAY. SAN PORTANTINO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED LEADERSHIP AND PASSION ON THIS ISSUE. AND YOUR WORDS IN SUPPORT OF SR TWENTY NINE X. WILL GO TO SENATOR GORGEOUS AND THEN DR PAM. PRESIDENT. I TO RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SR TWENTY NINE. APRIL TWENTY FOURTH AS WE CAN AS WE'VE LEARNED COMMEMORATES THE HUNDRED SIXTY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE. NO DOUBT ONE OF THE DARKEST CHAPTERS IN WORLD HISTORY. AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF A SIGNIFICANT ARMENIAN COMMUNITY WITH DEEP TIES THROUGH FAMILY AND FAITH. THIS ISSUE HITS VERY CLOSE TO HOME. MY WIFE'S GRANDMOTHER WAS A GENOCIDE SURVIVOR WHO FLED FROM SMYRNA TO GREECE AND IT FINALLY CAME TO CALIFORNIA IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. CALIFORNIA'S CENTRAL VALLEY IS HOME TO AN ESTIMATED HUNDRED THOUSAND ARMENIAN AMERICANS WITH FORTY FIVE THOUSAND APPROXIMATELY RESIDING IN FRESNO COUNTY. WHICH IS WHERE I CALL HOME. I'VE TRAVELED MANY TIMES TO ARMENIA AND ARTSAKH AND I FEEL VERY CONNECTED TO THE REGION IN FACT I WENT TO YEREVAN TO- PICK UP A GIRL AND BRING HER TO GREECE AND ASK HER TO MARRY ME. SO WE SPENT A GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME IN THE IN THIS REGION BUT WE COME TOGETHER TO HONOR. THE ONE AND A HALF MILLION ARMENIANS. AND AS I MENTIONED BEFORE. WELL WE REFER TO THIS IS THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE. IT ALSO INCLUDED A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF ORTHODOX CHRISTIAN MINORITIES THROUGHOUT- THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE. AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND- ANATOLIAN GREEKS IN ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PONTIC GREEKS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ASSYRIANS SO WELL OVER TWO MILLION PEOPLE WERE KILLED. AT THE HANDS OF THE ALDERMAN APPARATUS. BUT THESE ATROCITIES AS WE'VE HEARD FROM- THE CHAIR OF THE ARMENIAN CAUCUS ARE JUST LIMITED TO THE EVENTS THAT OCCURRED BETWEEN. NINETEEN FIFTEEN NINETEEN TWENTY THREE. IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS TURKEY AND AZERBAIJAN JOINED FORCES AND ATTACKED THE REPUBLIC OF ARTSAKH. OUR LARGER STANDING IS THAT THOUSANDS WERE KILLED. MORE THAN A COUPLE HUNDRED P. O. W. STILL HAVE YET TO BE RETURNED ARE THEIR WHEREABOUTS ACCOUNTED FOR. AMERICA CANNOT SIT IDLY BY. IN SELECTIVELY CHOOSE WHICH MORAL HAZARD HAS BEEN PERPETRATED AGAINST WHOM. IF WE ARE A NATION OF LAWS IF WE BELIEVE IN HUMAN RIGHTS AND I BELIEVE WE ARE BOTH OF THOSE. AT THE STATE. THEN WE NEED TO MAKE CERTAIN. THAT WE INVOKE. OUR PRIORITIES WITH RUSSIA WITH FRANCE THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE MEN'S GROUP. HOLD TURKEY AND AZERBAIJAN ACCOUNTABLE. THE CAUCUSES VERY COMPLICATED AREA OF THE WORLD. BUT WE CANNOT COMMEMORATE- THIS GENOCIDE. IF WE ARE TO FORSAKE WHAT IT MEANS TO ACTIVATE AND PREVENT WANTS TO COME. I WANT TO GIVE IT IN APPS THAT'S THE EXTENT ABSOLUTE GRATITUDE. THE PRESIDENT BIDEN. I HAVE SEEN MORE REPUBLICANS MORE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT CANADA PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES SAY ONE THING AND DO THE EXACT OFFICE DID THE EXACT OPPOSITE UPON OF BECOMING PRESIDENT THIS PRESIDENT ACTUALLY DID IT. NO POLITICAL CIRCUMSTANCES NO DOUBT OR A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT NOW THAN THEY WERE IN THE PAST. BUT POLITICAL CONVENIENCE IS NEVER A PREDICATE. TO DOING THE RIGHT THING. SO I SALUTE PRESIDENT BIDEN I ALSO SALUTE- CONGRESS FOR ITS PASSAGE OF RECOGNITION A COUPLE YEARS AGO. SR TWENTY NINE RECOGNIZES THE IN MOURNS THE LOSS OF MILLIONS OF SOULS MORE THAN A CENTURY AGO. BUT THE CALLS UPON EACH OF US TO BE MINDFUL OF HISTORY. AND PASS ALONG THESE LESSONS TO OUR CHILDREN. THANK YOU.

ON THIS DAY WE REMEMBER THE VICTIMS HOWEVER REMINDED THAT WE MUST STAND TOGETHER AGAINST THE DANGERS THAT AIM TO TARGET PEOPLE BASED ON THEIR RACE RELIGION POLITICAL VIEWS. AND OUR CULTURES. DURING THESE DIVISIVE TIMES WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF HISTORY. AS WE RECOGNIZE THIS MASSIVE VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE GENOCIDE OF THE ARMENIAN PEOPLE.

IT WAS WRITTEN ABOUT THE ARMENIAN RESISTANCE TO THIS GENOCIDE. AND COPIES OF THAT BOOK PERMITTED THROUGH THE GHETTOS OF EASTERN EUROPE. IN THE **** CLOSED IN ON THE JEWS.
