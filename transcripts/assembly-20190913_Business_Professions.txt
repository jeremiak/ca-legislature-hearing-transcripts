because we don't have a microphone to lock up to go to thank you good afternoon committee some Scott calling on and we're waiting fellow dentistry company based out of southern California so right and others in our industry provide safe affordable in the end airliners to Californians many of them who otherwise couldn't afford it we simply don't have the ability AB fifty nineteen came here under the guise of patient safety without any medical or scientific support that radiology is always required in order to correct mild to moderate a lot of issues it is not you also told the patients could buy these products online without rocking with the doctor that's simply not true that's always the case that we do our California patients are lined up with a license California's doctor reported of patients come to us over the internet and in various miles up for some of our competitors the bill of medical history thank of histories photographs taken questions and send those filters there are probably a life sentence reviews are file and the term is first whether they're a candidate or not twenty percent or so of the patients that are reviewed are not exactly because they simply require review more of what the doctor asked for more information one scene in the file they refuse five a clinician but the majority of our customers are eligible fortunately and receive treatment that they have been wishing they'd gotten for many times their entire life Dennis orthodontist additional model okay around fourteen hundred dollars for his members I have another financing for you all we have in the members remember children's birthday wishes so having already had enough sugar is in the tradition while dentist what the line is around fourteen hundred dollars or so -- through it three design are lined up now G. the turn around and sell it to their patients in their office right you were from five to ten thousand dollars depending on where their -- practices will calculation state my industry so the exact same product from mild to moderate she could for under nineteen hundred dollars across the board three individuals and roll areas specifically in California and cannot get access to the dentist usually for at all number of people who simply cannot afford five thousand dollars or more we can change lives we do change lives this is a customer by road us actually two causes of like running last week that I thought what's showing we're sharing with you that about thirty seconds left right five thank you very much my daughter's an actual patient she gets polluted schools and attempted suicide your to these factors your help means the world you're giving her confidence with their lives the bill supporting the city eight because it comes you based on potentially some other motives and that are ready to take way mazing service California -- recalling the mystery as an option probably is now have opposite in otherwise not worth noting in two thousand twelve the FDA for the record we do the prescription radiology clinicians never before as any state mandated use radiology specially not only a few minutes now this bill would require that -- regardless of whether the medically necessary -- or not this is not about patient safety this is about competition you know that everything they do to make the choice harder for Californians to protect you one step closer to keeping call dentistry matching making them quickly considering making up compete for lowering prices and we're doing the right thing my suggestion is to push this language for your heart industries suggested that come to the table and help create a policy that protects consumers will give them choices I believe and the industry believes the regulations important that consumer protection important patient protections important and we should get a table for that the legislative computer wrapped up with right -- without the legislation we're here to study its impact on public health and safety job losses in the practice of dentistry as a whole in the interim I taking this suggestion thank you for your time and their work in your service thank you for your testimony any other members the public opposition right sure number for each and then went back that respectfully here in opposition today and having good oral health and a smile that you can be confident with is no small thing and college I three technologies in California are growing part of making that people call for all for more people -- every day -- when this bill was in the Senate we did ask -- as my colleague mentioned for a one year delay in the policy provisions that are included in the sense that bill we thought that that would have given -- this legislature and the stakeholders including our industry and that is the proper time to figure out if this is an appropriate policy to move forward from the Taliban street -- in California we did ask for that we continue to believe that that would be the appropriate approach understanding that for your Gen -- but we do want to make sure that will be for understand that this is an industry manager because five access lower -- and so we need to make sure that are moving policies like this -- forward that we're doing in a way that will continue allow consumers to access this in California Mr turn members asking public affairs on the house don't recognize everyone else in opposition I am actually here on these are a little bit late there are also support or opposition Barbara Bettcher too many questions because it's a question for you the opponents is I understand that I heard size model moderate -- what the Dante there never case for this is used for severe issues it's not that they the clinician so because the state certified licensed doctor -- this size and shape -- and in our case about one out of five or turned away because they're fifties again within the conditions one of you -- but no these a workers to the shops and for more severe things are needed going to break in order -- if they are not accepted by that Dr -- there's many examples of that and not just based on the aggressive nature of art also based on their medical and dental -- five surveys and one official so in summary we're not the support we're not supporting senator Lynch as usual at the head start which again health regions nation we respectfully disagree with that -- characterization like many complacent detail wars you see in the better business bureau receive because in fact not review or looking he only imagine how was number of cases where they were assigned it is a line with a had severe or don't your problems they don't look this year Sonora they refuse actually so they can't come to the conclusion that that which is and for the online providers are children ever applied for customers no they're not -- they the okay I think it is as a ministry for treating the patients all third goal three -- to be in consideration and then at that point couple reviews which happens at different ages it is the product that I thought we were no it's not thanks Richard okay any other questions assembly where motion a second for the testimony was that correct correct okay they just want to I think house minutes support on the sunset of this board -- and the test me that you're heard is very specific to consumer protections that we want we will not remove -- the doctor from the conversation when we are moving bone and that is the consumer protection that we have in place and so you'll see a number of different -- conversations with respect this issue moving forward and the coming years -- but I appreciate your acknowledgement in consideration yet again so respect the abstract the effort will call the roll AB

now can we laughed about that next year of the ones he appreciate -- the attention to something that a lot of people don't focus on that thanks very much other testimony and support anyone in opposition a non will bring back committee questions I missed a lot actually the question about this just briefly -- one even knows the bill's prevents the board from issuing a certificate for the practice of shorthand reporting by means of voice reading of voice recognition technology can you tell us why that was put in the bill -- to believe that there's some of the stakeholders -- had -- spoken specific to this is the issue at hand to hand which some of the technologies and the utilization of what's currently in existence but as you've heard -- we're continue to working with many of the stakeholders and figure out a way to some the best practices that work for them -- similarly as well too so -- this was in a specific responsible we had heard from many of the different stakeholders okay I just wanna make sure that we're not preventing the industry from adopting practices that make them more efficient -- so are is this a conversation or to continue to have yes most certainly and that is a commitment that out you can make as well that's one the other questions the ocean second restored like close respect that type of card will call the roll AB fifteen twenty
