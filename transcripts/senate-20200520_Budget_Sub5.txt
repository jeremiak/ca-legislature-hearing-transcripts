AND I WOULD JUST START OFF SAYING THAT THE BASE REDUCTION AND IN LAST AND ACROSS ALL. STATEWIDE. THE FINAL LIST OF THE ISSUE. FOR OURSELVES AND THE HOWEVER I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT. YOU WHETHER OR NOT WE WOULD RESTORE SOME OF THE FUNDING THERE ARE THOSE PRODUCTIONS NOT WOULD BE CONTINGENT ON OBVIOUSLY WHETHER FEDERAL FUNDS BECOME AVAILABLE IN MOUNT OF FEDERAL FUNDS THAT BECOME AVAILABLE AND THERE'S ALSO LANGUAGE THAT I. PROVIDE FOR THE FEDERAL FUNDS THAT ARE PROVIDED HAVE SPECIFIC USES THAT COMPETE AND MANY. MORE AND I AM SO HAVING SAID THAT I HAD IT EXCEPT FOR ONE BECOME AVAILABLE THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE ITEMS THAT ARE ON THE CURRENT LIST WOULD NECESSARILY BE RESTORED CONSIDERED IN THE CONTEXT OF THOSE HAVE YACHT. A. THAT. YOUR LAST OLDER BUT WE ALSO. FIRST IN THE BROADER OF THE STATE SO THERE'S SOME GENERAL COMMENTS ON THE GENERAL AND IF YOU HAVE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT ANY OF THE ONES ARE LISTED. OUR REVIEW YES IT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S- I DON'T THINK I THINK YOU WERE YOU WERE DOING YOUR TO ARTICULATED WHICH IS A LITTLE HARD FOR US TO HEAR US HERE YOU POLICIES- HOPEFULLY YOU CAN HEAR US CLEARLY. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOU CAN HEAR US CLEARLY. YEAH YEAH OKAY YEAH I THINK IT'S JUST KIND OF AN ECHOING. THE. I DID HAVE SOME COMMENTS ON THE TRIGGER ISSUES BUT I WANT TO SEE DID DESERVE CENTER MOORLACH DO YOU HAVE EITHER A COMMONER QUESTION ON THIS YES THEY DO BUT I'M FOR IT YES I DO PLEASE GO TO FOLLOW THE CHAIR. YOUR CALL MAY THE EVERYONE OF US ARE EVEN THOUGH I HAVE ALREADY CHAIRED ONE OF THESE COMMITTEES IN THIS FASHION. IT IS STILL A DISCONCERTING TO ME SO ANYWAY. WHAT I'D THIS IS SPECIFIC TO THE TRIGGER QUESTIONS BUT ALL FOR TRIGGER CUTS BUT ALSO AN OVERALL COMMENT I NOTE THAT WHEN I LOOK AT THAT WHILE WE ARE STOPPED ME FIVE WE DEAL WITH CDC ARE. AND TO JUDICIARY AND DOJ IN A NUMBER OF OTHER. DEPARTMENTS WHEN YOU LOOK AT PAGE ELEVEN OF THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE. AND YOU LOOK AT THE CHART OF GENERAL FUND SPENDING. IT SHOWS EVERY SINGLE DEPARTMENT WITH A CUTS BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE PERCENT NOW OF COURSE THE EACH EACH DEPARTMENTS TOTAL DOLLAR AMOUNT VARIES THE OBVIOUSLY BUT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ARCHITECTURAL SCHOOLS IS THE I BELIEVE THE BIGGEST- DOLLAR ITEM- SO YOU KNOW THERE'S QUITE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SORT OF A- FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR AGENCY FOR. A SEVENTEEN BILLION AGENCY BUT STILL YOU LOOK AT THE PERCENTAGES. THE AGENCY CDC ARE ANDTHERE'S A NUMBER A COUPLE OF THESE CUTS IN HERE THAT ARE CDC ARE. TRIGGER CUTS ARM IT IS ONLY EXPERIENCING A LESS THAN 1% A ZERO POINT 7% READ GENERAL FUND REDUCTION. ALL OTHER AGENCIES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER WITH- THE NEXT SUPER LOIS PERCENT IS IN THE ORDER OF ABOUT 6% AND THEN IT RANGES ALL THE WAY UP TO NINETY THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY WHICH IS A SMALL AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND BUT STILL IT'S RECEIPT IS UNDER THE MAYBE REVISED. RECEIVING OR BEING RECOMMENDED TO RECEIVE A CERTAINLY WHEN I GO THROUGH OUR ENTIRE AGENDA I SEE THAT THE MAY REVISED DID WITHDRAW THE NUMBER OF EXPENDITURES AND DID LESSEN OR REDUCE EXPENDITURES WITHIN CDC ARE AS IT IS IT IT ALSO IN A NUMBER OF OTHER DEPARTMENTS THE JUDICIARY DO G. OTHERS. AND I CERTAINLY THERE ARE CERTAIN- PROGRAMS ARE CERTAIN PARTS OF CDC ARE WHICH I WOULD NOT WANT TO OR EXPECT AB SEE REDUCTIONS BUT WHAT I AM SOMEWHAT SURPRISED AT THAT WE NOT BE MORE EFFICIENCY OUT THERE COULD NOT BE A NEED SOME ADDITIONAL NEW SPENT. THAT WOULD BE READ STE THAT MY ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR SOME OF THESE CUTS NOW I KNOW THAT WHAT WAS JUST EXPLAINED IS THAT IF THE IF FEDERAL ACT IS SET THAT THE SEE. THE RIVER THE MIGHT COME BACK AND SAY LET'S GIVE BACK ON THESE CARS BUT TRIGGER QUE. BUT I GET I. WANT TO WHAT MONEY I WILL GET THAT THE THAT'S THE HOPE BUT NOT AN EXPERT. AND WHAT I WOULD ARE NOT A GUARANTEE AND WHAT I WOULD HOPE IS THAT WE COULD FIND SOME ADDITIONAL EFFICIENCIES AND AS WE GO THROUGH THE RIGHT OR CHEN. THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DISCUSS MEANT TO DETAIL. YOU'LL SEE THAT I AM AT LEAST RECOMMENDING THE REJECTION OF A FEW ITEMS OF EXPENDITURE. THAT I FEEL. AT THIS POINT ARE. APPROPRIATE GIVEN THE KIND OF DEFICIT WE'RE EXPERIENCING AND WHILE THE THOSE ITEMS ARE NOT ITEMS THAT I'M NECESSARILY. CONJOINING OR TRYING TO THE TRIGGER ITEMS I JUST RAISE THEM BECAUSE I THINK A FEW OF THESE TRIGGER ITEMS. ARE AREAS THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT THEY WERE IMPORTANT TO THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR WHEN WE ADOPTED IT BUT THE CONTINUE TO BE IMPORTANT TODAY FOR EXAMPLE. THE ADULT REENTRY GRANT PROGRAM BECAUSE AS WE KNOW IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS ABOUT THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE RELEASED FROM OUR STATE FACILITIES EVERY MONTH THAT'S JUST A NORMAL NORMAL DAY TO DAY. AND NOW THEY ARE RELEASED A TIME WHEN THEIR ABILITY TO GET A JOB AS PRIDE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN DIFFICULT. PROBLEM SIXTEEN WE SELL. AND THEIR ABILITY TO SECURE HOUSING SIX SEATING WE TYPICAL. SO TO BE MOVED. THE FIGHT FOR RE ENTRY SUPPORT. AT THE POINT WHERE WE KNOW YOU'RE RELEASING GOING TO THE COMMUNITY. WHICH TO GET NOT A NEW NUMBER BUT JUST N THE COURSE OF TEN AND TO CHOOSE THE ARE. YOU DUG THROUGH THAT PORT GRAHAM FIRST OTHER FOR. I JUST REYES AND IN ABOUT WHICH IS WHY. I WON BOTH FOR US TO HAVE THE SILENCE CHRISTIAN ALSO WHY WANTED TO HOLD IT AND NOT. APPROVE IT TODAY- BECAUSE I THINK THERE MAY BE SOME OTHER PLACES. EITHER IN. SIDE JUDICIARY DOJ CDC ARE WHERE WE MIGHT FIND SOME OTHER PLACES TO GET SOME EFFICIENCIES COMPARED TO THESE WANTS. TO SENATOR MOORLACH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I KNOW THIS. CODE NINETEEN RECESSION OR DEPRESSION YOU KNOW KIND OF CAME ON LIKE A HEART ATTACK SO% IT'S BEEN AMAZING TO WATCH SOME OF THESE NUMBERS BUT- IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT. EVEN THOUGH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES HAD TO RUSSIAN WORK REALLY QUICKLY TO GET SOMETHING PUT TOGETHER. THAT YOU WOULD MAYBE TAKE A- THE STEP BY STEP PROCESS- THE FIRST WOULD BE WHATEVER WE APPROVED IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET WE- BACK DOWN EVERYTHING IS NEW BACK IT DOWN. THEN YOU DO IT FOR THE- YEAR PRIOR. EIGHTEEN WITH WHATEVER'S NEW YORK YOU'RE JUST BACK IT DOWN WHERE YOU CAN YOU HAVE A METHODICAL LODGE TO. WHAT WE'RE DOING AS WE SCALE BACK AND CONTRACT. BUT IT BUT IT IT SEEMS. AS IF YOU WOULD DO ACROSS THE BOARD CUTS. LATER IT WOULD BE LIKE THE THIRD OR FOURTH THE FIFTH STEP. AND SO IT'S JUST SORT OF ITCHING TO SEEWHAT'S GOING ON I GET THE IMPRESSION MADAM CHAIR IN REVIEWING. THE DATA THAT EVERY DEPARTMENT MAYBE IS TAKING A YOU'RE YOU'RE TELLING ME TO MIDDLE DIFFERENT BUT- YOU KNOW EVERYONE'S TAKING A SIMILAR CUT ALREADY NOW- IN WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE BEGIN WITH BEING GIVEN SUCH. A DRASTIC- UNEMPLOYMENT. NUMBERS AND THE REST- THAT IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE WE'RE CUTTING THINGS CENTER. EMOTIONALLY. REACTIVE REACTS FULL TO LET ME GIVE YOU FOR WE'RE GONNA CUT SENIORS THAN YOUR RACE BECAUSE GO WHY WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT BECAUSE- IT'S- IT'S NOW THE MOST VULNERABLE SEGMENT OF OUR POPULATION THAT. COULD BE HARMED BY THE CORONA VIRUS. BUT IT'S IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT ISN'T DONE STRATEGICALLY IT'S DONE FOR EMOTIONAL REASONS AND- IN THIS OKAY WE'RE GONNA CUT. PLEASE PUBLIC SAFETY OR YOU KNOW. IT'S SORT OF A KIND OF AVAILABLE KIND OF THREAT TO ME- TO GARNER SOME KIND OF FEDERAL SUPPORT ACT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE- I MEAN IT'S- D. WHOEVER IT IS ALWAYS A STRATEGY BUT- NO. IF IT'S- BECOMING OF THE LARGEST STATE IN THE COUNTRY SO I'M I'M I'M- WONDERING MANAGER IT TO GO BIG AND GO BOLD ONE WHERE WE JUST MAKING A 10% CUT HERE WHEN WE MAKE A 25% AND JUST. FOR LOOKING JUST FOR. THEATRICS TO TRY AND IMPRESSED WASHINGTON DC TO DO SOMETHING THE BILL WAS OUT IN. WE GO BIGGER ANGLE BOLTS. IN ITS MAYBE MY WAY OF REACTING TO THE TO THE STRATEGY HERE BECAUSE I SEE THIS AS A BLUFF AND I AND THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S TACKY JUST. I THINK OF A BETTER STRATEGY COULD BE UTILIZED BEFORE WE MAY AT AYE AYE WILLOW SENATOR BILL AND THEN WE MIGHT HEAR FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT I THINK. I THINK THE POINT THAT. WELL YOUR YOUR POINT CENTER MORE LIKE IS WELL TAKEN AT LEAST IN AND DIFFERENT OF WE HAVE A DIFFERENT NUMBER A VERY PART MINSITER BEFORE US RIGHT WE HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WE HAVE THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. AB OEM PARTS OF IT NOT ALL AND WE A FEW OTHER THINGS CDC ARE AND THE POINT I WAS MAKING IT IT'S AN I DON'T KNOW ADVOCATES FOR JUST A FLAT OUT THINK IT I JUST IT AT LEAST IN THE CASE OF THE DISEASE WHICH IS A SEVENTY NINE BILLION DOLLARS THE PART ALL. AMOUNT THE DIRECTIONS THAT HARPER US IN THE MAYBE. EQUAL IN TOTAL LET THAN ONE PER. AND WHEREAS EVERY OTHER AGENCY REGARDING REGARDLESS OF ITS DOLLAR SIZE WHETHER IT'S A FORTY BILLION DOLLAR A TEN BILLION OR A FIFTY SIX BILLION HAS A MUCH LARGER PERCENT CUT THEY DON'T THEY'RE NOT THE SAME THEY'RE NOT AT ALL. AND THE ONLY THING THAT. THERE'S WE ARE I FELT THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND A FEW MORE EFFICIENCIES WITHIN CDC ARE- KNOWINGTHAT WE STILL ABSOLUTELY MUST PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY- BUT I ALSO NOTICED THAT THERE WERE A FEW. WHO OWLS BEING A RECOMMENDED FOR CDC ARE SO NEW EXPENDITURES AND AGAIN NOT THAT WE SHOULD REJECT ALL NEW EXPENDITURES CLEARLY IN A TIME OF ENDEMIC THEIR APPROPRIATE NEW EXPENDITURES BUT THERE SEEM TO BE SOME THAT MAYBE RIGHT NOW JUST START WARRANTED OLD THAT WAS REPLETE I WAS GONNA BAKE AND THE POINT I TRYING TO MAKE THIS TO ME WHEN I CONTRAST. THE WHAT THINGS WERE SO THE FOR A TRIGGER CUT VERSUS THOSE THINGS THAT ARE NEW. OF CENTER ABOUT. WERE UNKNOWN DIFFERENT TIMES IN NORMAL AND BUT I NOTICED SOME. SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE CUTS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE NOW AND THE AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE AREA. AND THE CUTS THAT TOOK PLACE DURING THE ROUTE LAST RECESSION IT IS APPEARS TO ME THAT A LOT OF THE SAME CUTS ARE BEING MADE WE'RE SORT OF CUTTING ON THE EDGES OF THE DEPARTMENT. OF A CORRECTION- PERHAPS NOT TRUE WITH THE JUDICIARY I THINK WE'RE CUTTING INTO THOSE ARE THE BASIC PART OF THE JUDICIARY- WITH THESE TRIGGER MECHANISMS BUT- THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS I THINK THERE ARE CUT IT- THE DIFFERENT SERVICES THAT ARE. FUNDED OF THEIR IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY THE DEPARTMENT AND SO FORTH- I REMEMBER THE LAST- GO AROUND TEN YEARS AGO WHEN WE CUT. A LOT OF THE PROGRAMS. AND THE RESULT WAS THAT WE I HAD- A REDUCE RECIDIVISM WE HAD- AN INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN- FACILITIES WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS OR BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS OF I'D SAY IT THAT WAY BE MORE PERHAPS MORE CORRECTLY PUT IT. AND THAT IT MUST OF INCARCERATION BECAUSE THE LEVELS OF THE INMATES SO INCREASED. SO NOW WE'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE INDEED HAVING A DECREASING POPULATION AND IT KIND OF. DOES CENTERS. PERHAPS. MAKES SENSE TO LOOK AT A DECREASE IN A POPULATION WITHOUT AT LEAST EXAMINING WHAT IS GOING ON IN THAT DEPARTMENT AND WHAT. WHY WE CAN REDUCE SAID. BASED ON THE DECREASING POPULATION SO FOR ME I LIKE TO KNOW- SOME RESUMES SOME STATISTICS OKAY WHAT IS THE POPULATION. NOT NOT IN THE MAY REVISE WHICH IS AN OLD NUMBER WHAT IS A POPULATION NOW WERE WERE GOING THROUGH A TRANSITION WERE. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE CHANGING I LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE POPULATION AS- OF THE GOVERNOR'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT CLUB THING FACILITIES. IS INDEED THAT HAVE. OF THE VIRUS. SPREADING IN THE PRISONS. HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE THE VIRUS IN THE PRISONS. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S ONE OR TWO ONE PARTICULAR PRISON HAS A LOT OF THE VIRUS AND I BELIEVE IT'S THE CHINO FACILITY BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT IT IS A PANEL FIRST AND- AT THE SAME TIME WHEN THEY'RE- THERE IS- THERE'S REQUIRE US TO. HOLD OFF. CLOSING A FACILITY THAT HAS AN OUTBREAK OF THE VIRUS WHICH IS GOING TO COST US MORE MONEY DEAL WITH RATHER THAN. MAYBE LOOK AT YOU HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT HAVE A VIRUS IN ONE PRISON THERE MIGHT BE A DECISION TO ACTUALLY. LOOK AT IT MAYBE. SHOULD WE SHOULD WE LOOK AT. IN A MEDICAL CENTER SHOULD WE LOOK AT- MAYBE MOVING PEOPLE OUT OF THAT FACILITY. I'M IS THAT OFFICE THE- THAT WE SHOULD- MOVE PEOPLE OUT OF I WOULD QUESTION THAT I WOULD RAISE THAT ISSUE. I REMEMBER WHEN WE HAVE ALEX LEAVER. SITUATION WITH- PEOPLE OUT OF ONE OF THE FACILITIES A FEW YEARS AGO. SO NOW WE HAVE THE VIRUS. AND IF THE VIRUS AT A CERTAIN LEVEL. MAY BE. FOR THE SAFETY OF THE EMPLOYEES AND THE INMATES THAT ARE IN THEIR FACILITY IN THEIR BOOKS ARE RESPONSIBILITIES WE CARE ABOUT- IN TERMS OF THEIR HEALTH ONCE THEY'RE INCARCERATED THEY HAVE TO BE. CHARTER HEALTH. AND ARE. AREN'T A COURT ORDER. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THERE'S- SO MAYBE MAYBE- MAYBE IT'S TIME TO MAYBE- ACCELERATE THE DISCUSSION OF THAT. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WITH THIS IN THAT FACILITY WHAT PERCENTAGE. AND THEN THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH TESTING IS BEING DONE IN THE IN THE CORRECTIONS DEPARTMENT. IS THERE ANY NUMBERS ON CREEK TESTING I MEAN IF YOU HAVE SO IF YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE VIRUS ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE NUMBER. ON WHETHER OR NOT. TO PUT PEOPLE IN DANGER SO WE HAVE TO KNOW SOME ANSWERS. AND THEN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CLOSING. WHAT IS THE COST OF RESPOND TO THE VIRUS DEALING WITH THE PROBLEMS OF THE VIRUS PLUS THE COST IS THE AUDITOR AND- THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S POINT OUT THE COST OF REHABILITATING HIS VERY FIRST THAT HAVE THE SAME. AND AS A MORE BILLION DOLLARS. ACTUAL COMMITMENT WERE BEING ON INTER CAN. TO REHABILITATE SOME OF THESE FACILITIES TO ME THE NUMBERS ARE THIS. BURDEN TO ADD UP AND TO EXAMINE AND SCRUTINIZE AND I THINK. THAT I AGREE WITH CHAIR. I AGREE THAT. WE HAVE TO EXAMINE THE SINGS MORE CLOSELY WE HAVE HAD A PREFERENCE OVER THE LAST DECADE TO OF FOCUS ON RE ENTRY AND HERE'S THE RE ENTRY GRAHAM BEING CLOSE BUT THE- THE COST OF CLOSING OF FACILITY IS NOT INCLUDE. THIS BOOK. IS I UNDERSTAND THE OF. MAYBE I WOULD THINK THEY'RE GONNA PROBABLY COME IN AND SAY WELL IT'S GOING TO COST YOU X. MONEY TO TAKE CARE OF ALL PLEASE MEDICAL COST. THIS YOU KNOW WHAT IS IT FIVE SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE. HOW MANY PEOPLE THE REASON I HAVE A MONTH FROM NOW. I HAVE. OF WHAT IS BEING DONE TO CURTAIL IT. IS THIS- DISTANCING POSSIBLE THESE FACILITIES MY UNDERSTANDING THERE'S DORMITORY FACILITIES THEY CAN'T DO SOCIAL DISTANCING. THIS READING WHAT THOSE WITH SO FAR. HOW CAN THE DESKTOP WHICH SOCIAL DISTANCING THEY CAN'T REALLY SO. IS IT INEVITABLE THAT THE VIRUS WILL SPREAD IT ON. IF THE VIRUS WAS SPREAD AND THEN WE'LL HAVE MORE PATIENCE INSTEAD OF INMATES. IT'S GOING TO COST US A LOT OF MONEY. IT IS WORTH ARE SCREWED NEED TO LOOK AT THIS AND I WOULD EXPECT THAT OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO THE TAXPAYERS A CALIFORNIA IS THAT WE WOULD LOOK AT THAT VERY VERY CAREFULLY. AND GET A GOOD HANDLE ON THAT NOW RATHER THAN WAIT TILL PROBLEM IS ON. WITH THEM BOTH OF MOTOR BILLION DOLLAR FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDS BY I EXPECT US TO DO. SAM AND THESE THINGS CAREFULLY AND I THE CHAIR WHAT HER HER DIRECTION IS ON THE BUT I ALSO HAVE THAT WE SHOULD AT THESE ISSUES AS WELL THANK YOU. APPRECIATE THAT BELL AND A- THE- IN OUR NEW. IF WE WERE NO DOING A TURN KEY SINGLE HERE. WE MIGHT HAVE HAD THE ABILITY OVER THE COURSE OF OUR MANY WEEKS TO HAVE A SINGLE HEARING ON SUCH THINGS AS FOR EXAMPLE THE CDC OUR POPULATION WHICH YOU ARE IN EFFECT- RAISING NOW SENATOR BILL THAT YOU'RE SEEING A VERY LEGITIMATELY IN THE CAR. OF THE DEMO. YOU KNOW NOW THAT THE CDC ARE WEBSITE GIVE US UP HONOR I THINK DALY NOW OF THE OF STAFF IN THE NUMBER OF INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE INFECTED. IN DOUBLE DIGITS SOME. I'D STILL THOU IN COURSE ENDED AND A LARGE NUMBER OF STAFF TO THE MULTI HUNDRED STAFF. AND IT IS CONCENTRATED IN A FEW FACILITIES SO OF COURSE- IN IN SUCH A- IN SUCH A HEARING WE MIGHT WANT TO HELP INTO WHAT WHAT ARE THE- WHAT SAFEGUARDS ARE BEING PUT INTO PLACE FOR. THE STAFF FOR THE INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS AND THEN OF COURSE BECAUSE WE THE RITUALS AND TO THE WITH A CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION IF TIME WITH THEIR SENSES SERVED THEY ARE RELEASED. AS ALL THE THINGS WE DOING LIKE THE CITY HI THIS THE PLASTIC SCREEN IN OFFICE WE. SIX TO REDUCE COMMUTE BREAD SO FOR WHAT SAFEGUARD WE TAKE. BY NO ME WOULD REACH US PREVENT SOME FROM GOING AT THE POINT OF NOT TIME RELEASE. BUT ARE WE DO TEST FOR UC'S. TO ENSURE. THAT YOU ARE. THEY ARE CARRIER THE- VIRUSES AND DOES. APPS A SYMPTOMATIC THERE SO THAT THEY CAN BE. TOLD QUARANTINE FOR SO THAT WE REDUCE COMMITTEE SPREAD BECAUSE THIS IS A CONGREGATE FOR AND WE KNOW THAT WE'RE THE SPREAD IN THE MOST STAFFS IN CAR PLEASE THE NEW HOMES IN. THERE I TALKED STOP THEIR WAS NO WHEN I THERE WOULD BE THE- IT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE CHARGED WITH TODAY WHICH IS THE BUDGET IT WAS WE CERTAINLY ARE IN TO HAVE TO STAY BUT I KNOW WHAT IT CAN. WHAT I AM PULL OUT FOR US TO DO WAY IN AT. AND MAYBE YOU MY FAILURE MEDIA SHOULD OF. MY MORE THOUGHTFUL AROUND BUT CERTAINLY WE AS MUCH AS WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE OP. ARE SYSTEM ANARCHY DASCHLE SO BECAUSE IS ALL WITHIN OUR HEARING ART OR YOU IN A WAY THAT IS OUR OF IS PUBLIC SAFETY. DISTRICT DISEASE FIFTY. SINCE IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ALSO HAVE TO WEIGH IN RELATIONSHIP TO HOW WE OPERATE THE CONGREGATE FACILITY AND AS SENATOR BILL NOTED THE FACILITIES WHERE E. VIRUSES MOST OF THE AT LEAST WE'VE MOST DID IT ARE THOSE FACILITIES WITH TORY ASCETICS WHERE YOU CAN'T GET PERCENT FOR THIS. AND I RAISE WILL THEIR THING WHICH IS NOT WITHIN OUR- WHICH THE WORD IT'S NOT AN I'D IN OUR BUDGET BUT IT AFFECTS POPULAR NUMBERS. THE GOVERNOR DIDN'T EXECUTIVE ORDER- BY MORE THAN A MONTH AGO MAYBE RIGHT IN MARCH WHERE. THE FOR THAT WERE BEING HELD IN COUNTY JAIL THAT WOULD NORMALLY BE TRANSFERRED TO OUR STATE FACILITIES THEY WERE HELD TO BE TRANSFERRED. AND THEIR DAD IS NOW BEEN LIFTED AND SO THOSE FOLKS WILL NOW GO INTO OUR FACILITIES AND IT DOES RAISE THE QUESTION SHOULD ONE BE SENT INTO. THOSE FACILITIES WHERE THERE IS SAYS. MOST PREVALENT. IN BUT THAT'S THERE WAS. IN THE WAY AGENDA WAS CONSTRUCT FOR US REALLY WEIGH IN ON THAT SO I THINK OTHER THAN EXPRESS. THAT HI YEAH. INAPPROPRIATE TO PUT ANY PERSON IN THOSE WE THE MOST CON SPREAD RIGHT NOW TO THE- AND AYE SIR. AS IN IF WE AT THE RECEIPT CA. ON GENERAL BOTH RECEIVER MADE COMMENTS ARE. THE HEALTH PRO AND RECOMMENDED THEY'RE NOT BE TREE BETWEEN SO IN I WOULD INTERPRET AS NOT ONLY NOT TRANSFER BETWEEN STATE FACILITY ACCENT STATE FACILITY WHY BUT ALSO COUNTY FACILITY TO STATE FACILITY BECAUSE EVERY MOVE. ACE POTENTIAL SPREAD OF THE VIRUS SO ANYWAY- HEY I WOULD. WE ARE A LITTLE WE ARE NOT FULLY OFF THE GENDER BUT WE'RE A LITTLE BIT SO. WE. THE REBEL BOOK THE MORE COMPOUND ALIVE IS MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDER WORK WITH THEY PAN OR THE PEOPLE THERE ARE WHICH OR LEGAL. UNDER OUR CARE NOT BE PUT IN DANGER. BY OUR VERY ACTIONS OR IN ACTIONS THAT WE TAKE. AND SO I THINK NOW THAT WE HAVE THE NUMBERS WE KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE. THE QUESTION IS LET'S TAKE SOME ACTION. IN SOME WAY TO REDUCE THE REST. AND WHAT IS THE PLAN THAT HAS NOT BEEN PRESENTED TO US AT THIS POINT AND HOW MUCH WILL IT COST THEM AND WE DON'T KNOW ALL. IS GOING TO BE A. A RUN AROUND THAT- WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANSWER FOR YET I MEAN WE DON'T KNOW IT'S GOING TO COST SOMETHING I CAN PREDICT OUT I CAN TELL YOU IF THERE'S- IF YOU HAD A SING HOME WITH 26% OF THE PEOPLE IN THAT NURSING HOME. HAVING THE VIRUS THEY THOSE PEOPLE OUT PRETTY QUICK AND TRY TO HAVE SOME CONSTRUCTIVE PLAN FOR. WELL THESE ARE NURSING HOMES CAESAR FACILITIES HAVE FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE AND- THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE AND I'M- SO. AND EVERY DAY PEOPLE ARE COMING AND GOING FROM THERE EMPLOYMENT THERE AND THEY'RE COMING AND GOING BACK INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. AND THEN PEOPLE ARE BEING RELEASED- AND IF WE HAVEN'T TESTED THESE PEOPLE WE DON'T KNOW. EXCEPT THERE CARRYING THE VIRUS. MY SAID WOULD BE TO DEVISE SOME WAY OF. INCREASING OURS SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO IT INCREASED- BY YOU KNOW EXPEDITE AND INCREASE THE TESTING AND TRACING OF THE ARRESTS COMING FROM THE FACILITIES. AT LEAST TRY TO CONTAIN AT SOME POINT AND THEN PRESENT US WITH THE PLAN. WE DON'T HAVE A PLAN SO THAT'S I THINK WE HAVE A MORAL COMPUNCTION TO DO THAT I MEAN IT'S THE SORT OF. AT A GIVEN EVIDENCE THAT WE NOW HAVE. OVER A THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT'S- AND THAT'S- TO ME IT'S OUR OWN OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS JUST THE YOU KNOW. WE'RE SITTING HERE TALKING ABOUT THESE LITTLE THINGS HERE BUT I THINK THAT'S THE BIGGER PICTURE. AT THIS POINT GIVEN THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO WORK NOW ON THE IMPACTS OF THE VIRUS. AND THIS IS THE PROBABLY THE BIGGEST FACTOR THANK. I DON'T WANT TO SEAL YOU KNOW A LOT OF DOUBTS AND- THAT KIND OF SITUATION THAT WOULD BE THAT DUE TO ANYTHING THAT WE DO SO. I THINK WE HAVE TO KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO AND DO OUR BEST YOU KNOW FIGURE OUT OUR ASSISTANCE WAY. WE CAN. MOVE MITIGATE THE ISSUE AND COME UP WITH A PLAN SO. THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING FOR. COME UP WITH A PLAN. ALRIGHT SO THIS ITEM WAS TRICKERY DIRECTIONS AND. I SEE THAT THE LA JOH HAS THEIR HAND UP SO I WILL. ALLOW FOR THEM IS IT TOO I NEED TO ASK THE MODERATOR TO ALLOW THE LA- TO MAKE A COMMENT OR JUST- OKAY THERE'S. VERY KAELIN OR NOT THANK YOU STAFF OF THE LA GO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CAITLYN O'NEILL WITH THE LEGISLATOR ANALYST'S I DO WANTED TO NOTE ON THAT ISSUE YOU UP AS A- AROUND THAT POPULATION AS A RELAY TO THE FACTS OF THE NINETEEN YOUR AB. RIGHT THE JAN YOU MAY REMAIN. BUT JUST THAT SAYS YOU KNOW WITH CHANGE IN THE- THAT ARE PART OF THE MAIN. DON'T HAVE REFLECT THE AND EFFECTS OF COKE. NINETEEN GENERAL A LOT OF ANSWER AROUND WHAT WILL BE NEEDED SUPPORT THE POP THE POPULATION. THAT WE CAN SEE ARE GIVEN THAT THERE'S SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY ABOUT. THE ACTIONS OF THE STATE WILL TAKE IN A FEW REGARDING CO IN NINETEEN FOR. THE TENSION LEE MADE. ANY JAILING. FOR A LOT OF TIME WHICH WOULD REDUCE POPULATION ON THE OTHER THERE COULD BE OUT. OF FOR SO. OF READ OF MANY THE RESULT PRO. THAT COULD INCREASE. AND FOR IF MADE ARE NOT I MEAN CREDITS AT THE SAME. THEY WERE UP WASTE. SO. BUT THAT BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE DIRECTING CDC ARE TO PROVIDE POPULATION AND FISCAL. PROJECTIONS BY OCTOBER FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY- THAT REFLECT THE IMPACT OF CO IN NINETEEN AS WELL AS- ON ON THE POPULATIONS AND- THAT FISCAL IMPACTS OF THAT AS WELL. AND THIS WOULD GIVE THE BUT FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO ASSESS WHETHER IT RE DIRECT POP. IN FACT EACH OTHER OR GOING TO NEED TO AUGMENT POPULATION RELATED FUNDING. AND THEN THERE WERE COUPLE OTHER OTHER ITEMS ON THE TRIGGER. I LESS THAT ARE MY MYSELF MY COLLEAGUES DID HAVE COMMON SIGN I'M NOT SURE IF YOU LIKE US TO OFFER THOSE COMMENTS NOW OR LATER YOU MAY OFFER NO. OKAY I'M ON THE ADULT REENTRY KEEP ON REENTRY GRANT WE DIDN'T HAVE A SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION BUT CHEN WOULD JUST NOTE THAT- IN THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND IN THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO WAIT COURSE. AND THEN ON THE COMMISSION CAN'T. CONSOLIDATION PROPOSAL WE DO RECOMMEND APPROVING BUT- GIVEN THAT THAT PROPOSAL WOULD REDUCE. THAT WOULD REDUCE THE CAPACITY OF CAMPS BY ABOUT NINE HUNDRED INMATES AND THERE'S CURRENTLY MORE THAN NINE HUNDRED VACANCIES I'M IN THE CAMP SO REDUCE. BUT AS A WAY TO IN OTHER WORDS CREATE. WITHOUT REDUCING THE NUMBER OF INMATES IN THE CAMPS. BUT WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERED DIRECTING THAT PARCHMENT TO INCREASE THE CAN'T POPULATION THROUGH. INCREASING ANY INCENTIVES OR- CHANGING IN MAINE ELIGIBILITY. TO THE EXTENT THE STATE IS ABLE TO DO THAT- IT COULD INCREASE THE CAMP POPULATION- AND REACTIVATE SUMMER ALL OF THOSE CONSOLIDATED CAMPS I'M WHICH COULD REDUCE STATE COSTS SUCH AS WILDFIRE COSTS. I'M AND THEN IN MY CAR I NEED A LEVY HAS A COMMENT AS WELL. SIR CAN THE HERE FROM THE NEED TO LEAVE. GO AHEAD I NEED ONLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE A COUPLE COPIES. XIN RELATED TO ADD TO THE JUDICIARY- IT REALLY HAS THREE PIECES AND- WHATEVER AMOUNT IS FINALLY DECIDED ON. WE DO RECOMMEND BUDGET THE LANGUAGE- IN ONE CASE RELATED TO THE TRIAL COURT SPECIFICALLY- AT MINIMUM WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE REDUCTIONS THE ALLOCATED BASED ON WORKLOAD. TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT ARE COMPARATIVELY LESS WELL FUNDED ON A WORK WOULD BE SINCE RECEIVE A SMALLER SHARE OF THE REDUCTION LEGISLATION ALSO HAS A FINE ANY ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE. IT IS NOT SUCH AS INSURING CERTAIN SOME HOLES ARE MATCHED. FOR THE REDUCTIONS TO THE STATE LEVEL JUDICIARY ANY OTHER JUDICIAL BRANCH PROGRAMS THE CURRENTLY ALLOCATED ON A PRO RATA BASIS AND THE LEGISLATION MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER- CHANGING THOSE ALLOCATE AND- THERE ARE D. DOT SO FOR YOU. BLOG WOULD USUALLY COUNT WILL PROVIDE VALUABLE SERVICES- THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER GIVING THE SUPREME COURT IN THE COURTS OF APPEAL A SMALLER SHARE OF THE REDUCTION TO ENSURE PUBLIC ACCESS. SERVICE IT'S- I ACTUALLY HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THAT BUT WHEN I READ THE ALEJO'S COMMENT. BECAUSE FI. THIS IS TO LONG AGENT I DON'T HAVE TO LEAF THROUGH IT ALL BUT MY MEMORY SERVES ME WITHIN THE PERCENT CUT TO TRIAL COURTS WAS EQUAL TO THE PERCENT CUT TO JUDICIAL COUNCIL IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE DOLLAR AMOUNT SHOP THREE DIFFERENT JUST AN BUT YOU SAY. AS WE MIGHT WANT TO. GIVE THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND THE- A SUPREME COURT- T FIRST A LOWER CUT TO GIVE ACCESS THE COURTS ARE I WONDERED WHO DON'T THE TRIAL COURT'S OR DATE. AS MUCH SKINNER. INTERFACING SAID YES SO I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY WHAT IT WHERE YOUR DISTINCTION IS THAT. THE COURTS- SPRING COURT JUDICIAL COUNCIL HAVE MY LOOK. I NEARLY AGAIN- WE ACTUALLY RECOGNIZE AS I THINK THE CUT SHOULD REFLECT THE PRIORITIES OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THAT COULD INCLUDE SHIFTING REDUCTIONS BETWEEN TRIAL COURT. THE SENATE JUDICIARY- OTHER THE OR THE OTHER USUAL RAN WRAPS UP SO HOW DOES ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE TALK ABOUT THE CUTS TO THE TRIAL COURT'S WE WANT ABOUT WHAT WILL SERVE. FOR OTHER REQUIRE. A LOT YOUR TIME LEVEL OF FUNDING THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO KIND OF MEET THAT EXPECTATION AND SO THAT CERTAINLY CAN BE- SOMETHING THAT THE NUMBERS ARE TO REFLECT THAT. AND THEN- I SEE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WANTED TO WIN BUT BEFORE YOU DO. HI I JUST WANT. JUST AT. SHE WHEN THE LA- MAKES A COMMENT THAT OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO WEIGH. ONE CUT. OVER ANYTHING ELSE TERMS OF OUR OWN OF AT THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES BUT I JUST WAS CURIOUS DEBT WHEN I WENT THROUGH AND- CAN I MAY HAVE MISSED SOME COMMENTS BUT- FOR THE LA. SPREAD SHEET AND THERE WERE WHEN I WENT THROUGH FOR THE DC ARE BUDGET THERE WERE A NUMBER OF NEW EXPENDITURES COUPLE OF THEM WERE COURT ARE RELATED SO THAT'S PROBABLY NO HARD FOR US TO GET. BACK AWAY FROM. A NUMBER OF OTHERS- WERE. MORE LET'S CALL ELECTIVE AND I DIDN'T SEE LA- COMMENT ABOUT YOU KNOW IT IT WHETHER THOSE WERE NECESSARY YET SO I'M I DON'T HAVE THEM DIRECT I MEAN I HAVE BEEN FRIENDS RATHER THAN TO THEM TO. BUT THE- JUST A COMMENT. YES LISTEN NEW EXPENDITURES WORD DATE TOTALED A LOT. ALL RIGHT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HE WANTED TO MAKE A COMIC GO AHEAD. HE SENATOR SKINNER JUST NAMING DEPARTMENT FIND A LITTLE LOUDER YOUR HARD TO HEAR RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU I JUST NEED TO MAKE A PART IN A FINANCE I WANTED TO RESPOND TO YOUR COMMENTS EARLIER ABOUT THE REDUCTION AND SEE START. POINTS AT THE FIRST POINT I'D LIKE TO MAKE IS. YOU AND BY. THE REMOVAL OF JJ HE STARTED BUDGET ASKING FIVE PART OF THE OVERALL BROADER BEELINE ME PROPOSAL. I HAVE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS EACH PART OF A YEAR WERE ACTUALLY RIGHT. PROGRAMMING BY. AND PERCENT INITIALLY MANY OF OUR MAJOR REVISION PROPOSALS REDUCE COSTS SIGNIFICANT YEARS SO THAT BY. TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR I SEE STARS BUT YOU. WHAT WHAT PERCENTAGE REPEAT THAT. 8% A LITTLE OVER 8% BY. TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. THERE ARE ONLY NOTE. YOU KNOW I'VE COURSE PRICE DEPENDING ON HOW THAT STONE WOULD PROBABLY WELCOME THAT I WOULD ONLY NOTE THAT. THE IN THE MAY ROOF THAT LOWEST CUT FOR ANY OTHER AGENCY. SO IN OTHER WORDS THAT'S AT 8% IS PROJECTED TO BE ACHIEVEDFOR THIS DEPARTMENT IN THREE YEARS WHEREAS IT'S BEING RECOMMENDED AT MINIMUM EVERY OTHER DEPARTMENT AT HIGHER RIGHT NOW. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT THAT DOLLARS BY TWENTY THREE I MEAN IT'S A LARGE DEPARTMENT WITH SIGNIFICANT COSTS AND. BUT AGAIN LOOK AT THE CHART ON PAGE ELEVEN. AND YOU'LL SEE MANY OTHER DEPARTMENTS WITH FAR FAR BIGGER BUDGETS WITH A MUCH HIGHER PERCENT. CUTS WHICH OBVIOUSLY WOULD MEAN TO VOTE. DOLLARS BELIEVE THAT. THINK OF ME MY POINT. I'M THE- SIR WE DON'T DO PUBLIC UNTIL THE END. VERY GETTING USED TO THIS AND SO THE RECOMMENDATION AND WE'RE GOING TO VOTE AT THE VERY END ALSO SO THE RECOMMENDATION ON THAT ONE IS TO HOLD ITS PROPOSALS- BUT WE WILL GO BACK TO IT AND WE WILL. WELL THAT WILL AND WILL NOT HERE MAN SO WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE- QUESTION I AM. RIGHT I THINK I'M GETTING THIS DOWN. IN CENTER- LIKE IF YOU'RE CONFUSED SO MY BUT JUDGE DON'T WORRY JUST I WILL I WILL RECOGNIZE YOU AT ANY POINT YOU HAVE A QUESTION OR COMMENT I'M FINE HI. OKAY SO WE WILL NOW. ISSUE ONE SIXTEEN DESCRIPTION ITEM AND- AGAIN MY STAFF TO CATCH ME IF I MAY JUMP IN OR MOVE INTO SOMETHING I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO A RATHER OUT OF ORDER. SO WE'LL GO TO ISSUE WHAT ECKSTINE VARIOUS CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM PROPOSALS WHICH WE HAVE- FOR DISCUSSION. AND I THINK THE A- THE FIRST THE FIRST TWO ARE THE DJJ THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE CHANGE WHICH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST REFERENCED AND- I THINK IT'S WORTH IT FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUSTICE SCRIBE OR WHOEVER. TO DESCRIBE WHAT IT IS THE MINISTRATION HAS IN MIND NOW FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE. SELECT SEE. ALRIGHT SO DEPARTMENT FIND IT'S GO AHEAD IF YOU JUST NEED A MINUTE PART OF FINANCE AGAIN. REVISION PROPOSES TO REALIGN VISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE TOWARDS YOU CAN BE SURE. GEN OBVIOUSLY IMPLEMENTED BY GETTING JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE STOPPING ALL IN EIGHT IN THIS STATE FACILITIES AND REQUIRING THAT THE COUNTY SUPPORT AS- YOU CAN I WAS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE SENT STATE THIRTY. POSING FEDERAL FUNDING MATTER. AND THEN OVER THE OVER SEVERAL YEARS- DJJ WOULD BE DRAWN DOWN TO A POPULATION OF ZERO POINT CLOSE. I THINK IF YOU DON'T MIND IF YOU WOULD BE WORTH IT TO. I FAMILIAR BUT PERHAPS FOR ANY PUBLIC THAT MAYBE OR STAFF THAT OBSERVING THAT THIS IS THAT WE EIGHT A CHANGE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE ADOPTION THE LAST YEAR'S BUDGET- WHICH- DIDN'T NECESSARILY ENTAIL CLOSING OF THOSE FACILITIES BUT MOVED THE ENTIRE. NATION INTO A DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT AND- THAT WE WILL NOT PROBABLY BE EVEN HEARING THE ITEM I DON'T KNOW THAT FOR SURE BUT IF IT. IF HE ACTION TOOK LAST YEAR BEING CONTINUE TO DO WOULD FRIDAY BE A DIFFERENT SUBCOMMITTEE WHO WAS CONSIDERING THINGS FOR THE TO THE JUVENILES BECAUSE IT WOULD. PARCHMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. THAT THAT PART OF THIS CHANGE ALSO ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU- LAST YEAR WE HAD PROPOSING THAT HAD BEEN PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THIS YEAR WE WERE GOING TO MOVE IF YOU'VE BEEN OUT JUSTICE IN HELPING SIR. YEAH YOU TO CALL. YOU REST. I'M WITH A DIFFERENT EMPHASIS TREATMENT AND PROGRAMMING FOR WORK RATHER THAN IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND HEALTH. SERVICES THE SYSTEM- BECAUSE IT. OKAY KEEN IN THE PANDEMIC WE REALIGNING RECONSIDERED THAT NOW. MOVING HOUSING. USE IT THEY COUNTY COMMITTED IN CLOSE GET EVERY FAMILY MAKING. AND SO BOTH OF THE ITEMS. FIVE TWO TWO FIVE ONE FIVE THREE TWO SEVEN RELATE TO THAT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU. REFERENCED SAID ONLY COMMON YOU WANTED TO MAKE ON ITEM FIVE TWO SIX TWO SEVEN ALSO JUST THAT OVERVIEW. THANK YOU SEVEN THE BOARD OF STATE COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS WOULD BE INVOLVED IN THIS PROPOSAL BY PROVIDING THE GRANTS AND FUNDING TO COUNTIES. IT'S PROPOSAL ON THAT'S WHY IT'S AN- CAN BE. YOU HAVE ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT- I'LL MAKE A COMMENT AND THEN YES SENATOR MORE LIKE ABSOLUTELY I'LL CALL IN YOU AND THEN I KNOW LA WANTS TO MAKE A COMMENT SO IT'S- I CAN APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS A LARGE CHANGE TO DIGEST LAST. BIG ENOUGH TO YES THIS IS. TODAY CHEN. ONLY THING I WOULD NOTE IS THAT INTERESTINGLY MANY OF THE COMMUNITY ADVOCATES. FAMILIES OF USE THAT ARE IN THIS SYSTEM WERE WERE IN YEARS PAST AND DEFINITELY LAST YEAR FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE BAITING MOVED TO HELP SERVICES. WELL THEY WERE SOMEWHAT OPEN TO THE SHIFT TWELVE NEWMAN SERVICES WHAT THEY WHAT THEY ALL PREFERRED OR AT LEAST WHAT THEY COMMUNICATED WAS THAT THEY'D WANT. THE HE'S CLOSED WANTED THE YOUTH TO BE. THEIR TREATMENT THERE REHAB PROGRAMS THERE- THERE. THEY'RE BEING HELD IN COMMUNITY THEY WANTED THEM CLOSER TO HOME THEY FELT THAT WHAT THEY WERE EXPRESSED IS THAT THEY WOULD BE CLOSER TO THEIR SUPPORT SERVICES AS- AND- THEY WOULD. REPORT THREE INTEGRATED ONCE THE HEAD OF A- OF THEIR- SENTENCE IN SUCH AND SO IT'S INTERESTING THAT NOW. AND I'M ASSUMING PART OF THIS IS DUE TO- YOU KNOW BUDGET THREE ON THINKING. THAT BY THIS SHIFT WHAT MAY NOT COME. DOES THAT IT'S ONE IT IS CLOSER WHAT IT IS IT IS HOLDING THE A DOES TO GET INTO OUR JUVENILE SYSTEM CLOSER TO HOME. AND I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT MANY OF THEM POINTED OUT CNET WE HAD REPORT ON IS THE FACT. SOME YEARS BACK THE STATE ASSISTED COUNTIES AND- WE INVESTED A LOT OF MONEY IN THEM TO EXPAND. THEIR COUNTY JUVENILE FACILITIES AND THAT WE WERE FACING IT LAST YEAR THIS YEAR A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF YOUTH IN COUNTY FACILITY WE'RE HAVE HUGE THE SAUDIS WITH VERY FEW PEOPLE. AND THUS THE COST PER YOUTH WAS EXPLORED. POTENTIALLY HIGH BECAUSE THE FACILITIES. IN MAINE IN REGARDLESS MANY FOR IT. SO FOR EXAMPLE WAS A REPORT IN AND MORE INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST THAT SHOWED I THINK THIS COUNTY SANTA CLEAR SPENDING SOME FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PER YOUTH. OTHER COUNTIES THREE IN TWO THOUSAND THREE. AND WHAT PEOPLE WERE UPSET BY THE FACT THAT IN THE STATE WE SPEND ABOUT. I THINK IT'S RUN ORDER EARN FIFTY K. FOR YOU WITHIN THE STATE FACILITIES THE COUNTY COSTS WERE MUCH HIGHER. SO I REACHED THAT BECAUSE WHILE THIS COULD BE AND I THINK IT'S ANTICIPATED TO BE. A WAY TO ACHIEVE SOME SAVINGS IF THE COUNTIES. CONTINUE TO SPEND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ARE ALL. ONE THE U. THAT WE WOULD NOT ACHIEVE THE SAVINGS NOW I APPRECIATE THAT. PART OF THE ITEM THE SECOND ITEM IS THAT THERE WOULD BE GRANTS TO COUNTIES BUT I THINK THAT WHAT. WHAT I THINK MANY OF US WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT MORE TIME TO TALK ABOUT THE DETAILS IN TRAILER. THAT WOULD ALLOW. SURE THAT THE REHABILITATIVE AND PUBLIC SAFETY OBJECTIVES ARE ACHIEVED BY THIS MOVE BUT ALSO WE CHIEF THE COST CONTAINMENT WE DO NOT WANT TO BE PENNY WISE POUND FOOLISH BUT WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO SEE US GO OUT SO I WAS AMONG THE ISSUE THAT WOULD NEED TO STILL BE DISCUSSED. IN THE IN IN FOR BUT ON SUCH AN ACTION CENTER MOORLACH Q. MINIATURE MOVING. THE SIEGE IN ADULTS TO HHS WAS IT WAS A PRETTY BIG. DEAL LAST YEAR AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKE LIKE A KIND OF A WHIPLASH LIKE ALL OF A SUDDEN. THE ABOUT FACE KIND OF MOVE SO. I DON'T KNOW. IF IT'S A LACK OF VISION OR LACK OF FOLLOW THROUGH OR LACK OF MONEY- BUT IF IT WAS GOOD LAST YEAR WERE NOT GOOD THIS YEAR AND SO I GUESS THE QUESTION I WOULD HAVE IS. MOVING THE- INDIVIDUALS NOW TO THE COUNTIES IS JUST ANOTHER FORM REALIGNMENT. AND COUNTIES ARE STRUGGLING TO SO HOW HOW IS THIS GOING TO. A WORK OUT. WITH WITH THEIR FINANCES AND I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM C. SACK FOR. TO PREVENT THIS SITUATION. OR THE REST THE BECAUSE WE'RE JUST SORT OF GET THIS LAST NIGHT SO THAT SO JUST AND REACT TO A MANAGER AND MAYBE- DEPARTMENT FINDING IT. BY LITTLE THERE IF OF THE- HISTORY OF THE THINKING BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A BIG BOLD THE LAST YEAR. NOW TO YANK IT IT JUST SEEMS. I JUST LOVE TO HEAR THE STORY. AT CENTER ROAD DID YOU WANNA MAKE GOING. THE BOY. YOU KNOW LAST YEAR I DID I DID SOME LEGISLATION ON THIS AND. THE ADMINISTRATION OF RUN FINANCE OPPOSE THE BILL- IN A DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT. COUNTIES WERE ACTUALLY SENDING. JUNE DOES FOR LOWER LEVEL. THE FENCES TO THE STATE AND WE WERE SPENDING THE MONEY TO CARE FOR THEM IN THE COUNTIES WHERE SPENDING ANY MONEY WE NEVER CHARGE THE COUNTY. SO WE CALCULATED THAT MAY BE. 25230% OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE IN THE STATE FACILITIES. PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN CARE FOR THE COUNTY FOR THE FACILITIES BASED ON THEIR OFFENSES AND IT WAS VERY INTERESTING TO COMPARE COUNTIES OF SOME OF THE LARGEST COUNTIES- AND VERY FOR. PEOPLE TO THE STATE FIRST SOME OF THE SMALLER COUNTY SAN AT THE A DISPROPORTIONATE. NUMBER OF YOU'VE TO THE STATE FACILITIES SO HE'S COUNTY. HAD A DIFFERENT APPROACH SOME COUNTIES LIKE TO SEND YOU KNOW SOME COUNTIES AND THE JUDGES THERE ARE LIKE TO SEND PEOPLE TO THE STATE SOME COUNTIES DIDN'T BUT- WHEN YOU SEE THAT KIND OF THING YOU YOU THINK WELL THERE'S SOME. DISSIDENTS AND THE WAY WE MANAGE OUT. THERE ARE NO. I'M KIND OF INTERESTED THE FACT THAT THERE ARE NOW. DEVELOPING A REALIGNMENT OF THESE PROGRAMS. TO GIVE THE COUNTIES A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR ANNUAL PAYMENT. IN RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT IN THE STATE JUVENILE FACILITIES ARE SIGNIFICANT SEX OFFENDER TREATMENT. FOR MENTAL HEALTH A- SO THEY'RE SAYING IS OKAY WE'RE GONNA GET MONEY FOR THESE ARE SERIOUS OFFENDERS BUT WERE. AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE ALL THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE STATE FACILITIES. THAT WE SHOULD HAVE THIS SHOULD BE IN THE COUNTY FACILITIES. I LIKE TO POINT OUT FOR MY STEAM CENTER FROM ORANGE COUNTY THE ORANGE COUNTY HIT SINCE VERY FEW. VERY VERY FEW PEOPLE TO THE STATE FACILITIES. MUCH THERE ACTUALLY ARE LOWER THAN MOST OF THE LARGE COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA I THINK THEY'RE THE LOWEST FOR EXAMPLE BECAUSE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PROGRAMS AND THEY- TAKE CARE. IN THE MOST SERIOUS OFFENDERS. SO I THINK THIS NEEDS TO BE SQUARED UP AND SQUARED AWAY. AS PART OF THE US AND WE'RE WE'RE BEING ASKED TO- ALLOCATE MONEY FOR THIS OKAY THAT'S WHY THIS IS A VERY COSTLY WHATEVER WE DO. WE HAVE TO I THINK DETERMINE SOME STRICT GUIDELINES ON HOW AND ACCOUNTABILITY SO THAT WE'RE WE'RE SERVE EVEN HANDED ABOUT THAT'S GONNA PUT BY. ARM WE ATTEMPTED TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION LAST YEAR THEY DID NOT- SICK WE DID NOT SUCCEED BUT NOW THEY'RE COMING BACK WITH THIS PROPOSAL. I THINK THERE TO BE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY. A RELATIVE TO THE NEXT SECTION TWENTY. I THINK THE BORDER COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS ISSUE WE RISK GOT AN AUTO. THERE IF YOU READ THE AUDIT I DID I GOT THE AUDIT- ON THE BORDER COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS AND THEIR IMPLEMENTATION OF. THE JG CPA AND THEY SAID THE- OVERSIGHT IS WEAK. AND OF THE LOCAL CORD AND COUNCILS OR DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY IN EACH COUNTY KIND OF JUST WHAT I JUST TALKED ABOUT. IT. I'M SURE I WOULD PROPOSE SOMETHING SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT. OF WE'VE MANDATE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT MEASURES FOR THE COUNTIES ON THESE TWO PROGRAMS AND THE HAVE THE BOARD OF COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS. HOUSE ROLL THE FINE THEN FORCED IN TERMS OF. THE TRAILER BILL THIS DEVELOPED ON THIS WE GOT TO HAVE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. A REAL LINE OR YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME STANDARDS WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME CONSISTENCY. WE CANNOT COVERED BODY DOING THEIR OWN THING WE- THAT WOULD NOT BE FAIR TO THE TAXPAYERS A CALIFORNIA BE AWARE THE MONEY IF WE DID THAT IT WOULD BE MONEY SPENT. DIFFERENT A IN DIFFERENT AREAS THAT'S NOT THE CORRECT THING TO DO SO I WOULD PROPOSE THIS BE ADDED- PERHAPS- IF YOU ACCEPT THIS RECOMMENDATION TO ESTABLISH AN MANDATE ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT MEASURES FOR COUNTIES. AND ABORT. THE BORDER CAN YOU CORRECTIONS THEN PUT SOME FORM OF A LANGUAGE ON THAT ISSUE IN THE TRAILER BILL AT SOME POINT. ON THE ISSUE IF FORGET. SO THAT WOULD BE MY RECOMMENDATION IS A MESS IN MY COLLEAGUES TO. SUPPORT THE- ACCOUNTABILITY OF I SPENT ABOUT TWO YEARS ON THAT BILL IT GOT THROUGH RIGHT TO THE END AND THEN. YOU KNOW IT STOPPED WENT THROUGH THE SENATE. NOBODY OPPOSED THE REMOTE WAS PRETTY MUCH. THE SENATE THE WENT TO THE ASSEMBLY OF GOD STOPPED AND APPROPRIATIONS. SO I THINK I TAKE- I THINK THIS WOULD BE A GOOD RECOMMENDATION OUR HOPE YOU CAN ACCEPTED MY COLLAR. CENTER MORE MARK AS WELL THANK YOU. CENTER WILL APPRECIATE THOSE. WHAT YOUR EXPRESSION BECAUSE IT'S CONCEPTUALLY AND I WILL CALL IN LA NEXT BUT CONCEPTUALLY I DO KNOW THIS. WHAT OF WHEN I GOT ELECTED TO THE ASSEMBLY AND I FEEL LIKE I'M GETTING TO RE LIVE. I GOT ELECTED DURING THE I GOT ELECTED I TOOK OFFICE RIGHT AT THE POINT WE AT THE SIXTY BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET DEFICIT SO TWO THOUSAND AND- DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT NINE ON. AND WAS THROWN INTO MY FIRST SHOULD VOTE WITHIN A WEEK OF BEING SWORN IN AND WELL NOT BUT I WON'T. GET A- MORE BECAUSE IT. WILL ONLY BRING BACK ALL THE PTS. BUT THERE ARE DURING THAT TIME. WE HAD DOUBLE NUMBER OF WAR IN THE JUVENILE FACILITIES AND WE WERE SPEND FIXING AMOUNTS MONEY AND THERE GREAT DESIRE TO CLOSE THOSE. WITH WERE MORE THAN AND THEY WERE IN AND A FIFTH WILL DETERIORATE. THANKS SO WE MADE A FEW. THAT WE COULD ONE OR TWO I CAN'T READ ALL THE WE CHANGE THE SOME POLICY IN ANY TO THE NOW WORRIED ABOUT HALF THE POPULOUS. OF BAD DEBT. RIGHT WE HAVE A SEVEN HUNDRED. DID YOU HEY MICHAEL STAFF RATE WITH RANGE THAT'S HUNDRED SO. EIGHT HUNDRED. SO IN THIS CHANGE THAT WORK HARD TO. OR THAT WAS BEING BROUGHT TO US. IT WILL MOVE ABOUT EIGHT HOW PEOPLE. VARIOUS COUNTY FOR AND ALL I WOULD HAVE. WHY DON'T THE IT'S STATE SPOKE. IT WOULD TO THEIR COUNTY OF. ON AND BUT FROM WHAT TO BELLS IS FOR X. YOU KNOW. ORANGE COUNTY MAKE IT VERY FOR BECAUSE THEY SAID FEW AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER. ARE LIKE THAT THE WAY TO SEEN A- BUT ANYWAY SO CAN. SINCE THERE IS BEEN. LONG DESIGN. TO CLOSE THOSE STAY TO SELL FOR NON EVERY WHY BECAUSE OF THEIR REMOTE LOW. MANY OF THAT. HAD LESS AT. TO HOLDER. OF MENTAL HEALTH AND- EDUCATION AND OTHER TYPE OF PROGRAMMING. PERFECT EXPERTS IN SUCH. AN IMPROVISED THE TOP OF. UP SERVICES THAT THE PEOPLE NEED IT. YOU TO SEE IF THERE'S TO REALLY PUT A PAIR OF REBUILD. AND OF COURSE WE THAT EVERY AREA OF THE STATE BUT MOST OF OUR CAL OR- SACKS THAT THEY HAVE MORE AT. TO THAT TYPE OF PROGRAMS. SO CONCERT. A THIS IS. A GOOD MOVE HOW WHAT WE THINK ABOUT WE HAVE NO OF. CAN PLEASE. DON'T HOW MANY OF THE HAVE SENT BOOKS TO JUVENILE BUT LET. ME WALK YOU GOES BACK TO ONCE A REMOTE COUNT. NO WAY THAT DOES FOR. THE FOR THAT RIGHT WE'VE ONE TO SO I THINK THERE ARE TWO. SOME THAT WE WANT HIM OUT REAL BECAUSE WE OP WE TO INSURE. THAT IF WE GO WITH THIS PROPOSAL IN SHOULD BE CAN. THAT WE ARE PROVIDE. THE LEVEL OF SIR AND AB WE WE'VE CHIEF THE OF IN THAT NOT PUTTING ASIDE A IN OF IN A CAMPER FACILITY THE REAL THERE IS REALLY NO SOME FOR THEM WE ARE GIVING THEM SOME THE COUNTY SOME OUT. DATE IN SUCH A TRAILER BILL. AND I'M SURE THERE ARE SOME OTHER THINGS THAT WE WOULD. WANT TO PUT IN SUCH TRAILER BILL BUT WHILE I HAVE LOOKED AT THESE FOR A FEW MORE DAYS IN A SENATOR MORLOCK I STARTED READING THEM THE VICE THE DAY IT DROPPED- I CERTAINLY HAVEN'T. WE WANT TO ENSURE WAS PUT IN TO LANGUAGE TO FACILITATE THIS KIND OF MAJOR SHIFT. THAT WELL I DESCRIBED BY COULD CONCEPTUALLY SUPPORT SO- I THINK THAT ARE. SUGGESTION TO. BACK TO THE WAS THIS. THE OUR RECOMMENDATION ON THESE HOLD THEM OPEN WAS THAT I CAN WHERE'S THAT. I WILL TELL YOU BUT I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I DIDN'T KNOW IF I SIDE ANYWAY. BECAUSE IT WOULD GIVE US THE ABILITY TO HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND IT'S POSSIBLE THAT. DUE TO OUR CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION FOR THE BUDGET WE MIGHT HAVE TO LAND ON A DOLLAR AMOUNT. FOR OUR- OUR THANK YOU KNOW IN ORDER TO VOTE. UP AFFORD BAND ON OR BEFORE JUNE FIFTEENTH BUT IT MAY TAKE US A LITTLE LONGER FOR THE TRAILER BILL. THAT'S NOT UNUSUAL BUT I THINK OF A SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE LIKE THIS WE MAY NEED MORE TIME SO I JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT OUT. A POSSIBILITY. TRAILER BILL. THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT ACTIONS IN ANOTHER CALL CONSIDER BILL AND THEN CENTER MORE LIKE AND THEN I WANT TO CALL IN LA OF I HAD. ONE ISSUE IT'S REFERRING TO PAGE FIFTY- GOSH IT'S ON MY OLD PAGE FIFTY SIX WHAT'S THAT- IS ON ISSUE FIVE TWO TWO SEVEN OKAY. ED IS REGARDING THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE REALIGNMENT. LET ME SEE IF I CAN FIND THE CORRECT CASEY ITEM THE AREA OF THE. ZERO FIVE TWO TWO SEVEN. OKAY AND IT TALKS ABOUT. THE THREE REGIONAL SEX OFFENDER TREATMENT HUBS FOR WAR TO ME THE ASSOCIATE CRAP OKAY THAT'S IN THAT IS RIGHT HERE THAT IS. JUST. IT'S TO ZERO EIGHT AGES WHICH- SO IT'S JUST RIGHT HERE ON THE SECOND PAGE OF THE TRIGGER SO ARE NOT TRIGGERS IT'S SEC PAGE IS CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM PROPOSALS SO ISSUE ONE SIX EIGHTEEN. AGAIN IT DOES HAVE THAT COLUMN NUMBER FIVE TWO. PAGE FIFTY AND IT'S NOW PARAGRAPH ABOUT TO SUPPORT THE COUNTIES. THERE WOULD BE THESE THINGS INCLUDING THE REGIONAL HUBS OKAY THE QUESTION I HAVE IS. IT SAYS. NATION OF HOUSED IN STATE JUVENILE FACILITIES THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT. SIX BEHAVIOR TREATMENT. OR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT NEEDS. AND THE QUESTION I HAVE IS WHY ARE THEY BEING GROUPED TOGETHER IS THAT WAR SHOULD THAT BE HAND OR IS IT. IF IT'S AN ORDER IT'S NOT. PROBABLY APPROPRIATE YOU'RE NOT MIXING SEX OFFENDERS WITH PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. SO IF AN END THAT MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE. SO CHECK. I WOULD WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THAT. SELECT JUST CLARIFICATION SO ARE FRIEND THAT YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT TO HAVE THOSE WHO ARE SIGNIFICANT MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT NEEDS TO BE PROVIDED FOR WITHIN SEX OFFENDER TREATMENT HUBS ABSOLUTELY NO OKAY. THE GOOD. YEAH SO THEN THEY THEN THEY GO ON TO SAY WE WANT TO ESTABLISH THREE REGIONAL SEX OFFENDER HUBS WITH THOSE- WHAT IS THE PLAN FOR THAT WHY DID THEY PICK THREE. HER. PER UNIT YOU KNOW. REMAIN SO. IS IT LIKE TEN PEOPLE PROOF FOR EACH ONE. WHAT IS THE NUMBER WHAT IS THE SIZE OF THE US HOW MUCH SHOULD YOU KNOW THEY'RE ASKING FOR AN MILLION DOLLARS I GUESS. BUT A MAN SUREST TO BE HELD OPEN. SO I WOULD HAVE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR SERVICES THREE REGIONAL MEETINGS THAT THEY WANT TO HAVE- SO ON THE STATE. SOME OF THE THINGS KIND OF. I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT YOU KNOW MIKE. EXACTLY HOW MANY YOUTH IN THE STATE FACILITIES ARE IN THE SEX OFFENDER SIGNATURE IT IT'S WORDED IT NEVER GETS OFFENDER ALLEGORY. IT WILL. BRING ABOUT. THE REASON I ASK IT WOULD BE TEN. IF IT'S LIKE FIFTY PEOPLE START GOING TO BE. SEE IT'S GOOD FOR YOU A BOARD THAT COST WAY MORE NOT. OKAY SO LET'S HEAR FROM THE LA OF. GO AHEAD ON THE SIDE OF. RED RELIEF YOU TO OR YOU CAN SPEAK TO ONE YOUR VOICE. TOMORROW THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE RECOMMEND THIS PROPOSAL AS IT IS TO CONSISTENT WITH OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. BUDGET TRAILER PLACE YOUR DRESSING UP ITEMS WHICH WOULD BE CONCRETE FOR THE- OF. DJJ BY JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY THREE THIS WOULD AVOID RUNNING THE INSTITUTIONS WHERE SMALL POPULATION HI COSTS THIS STATE WELL GIVEN THE COUNTIES TIME TO. ALONG COUNTIES TO CONTRACTORS DJJ FULL COST ASSESS COUNTIES WITH THE TRANSITION AND BROUGHT. OR IS IT YOU SEE THEY DON'T HAVE. IS IT. UNTIL CLOSER DATE AND YOUR TUNES. CIRCLE THE TWO. THE WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR BEFORE THE EIGHT. OR THREE WORKING. IT FUNDING FOR COUNTIES WITH AN AMOUNT THAT THE SEC DETERMINES NECESSARY TO RUN AN EFFICIENT PRO. JULY TWENTY TWELVE. ALLOW EASY TAUGHT ME THAT THE NATION. AND FIVE IT TAKES STEPS TO DO SO LIKELY USE BEING SENT TO STATE PRISON AS A RESULT REALIGNMENT THAT IS ABOUT THE AGE OF YOURS. I'M ON THE RECOMMENDATION ON THAT WOULD STRONGHOLDS OF THE TRANSITION TO DO I SEE ARE USED TO THE RESTORATION WHICH WOULD BECOME AS OF THE LAST BUDGET. I'M A STAY IN ON THAT IS. SB FIND OUT WHEN WE RECOMMEND ELIMINATING AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION THAT WAS APPROVED AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TO SUPPORT TRANSIT. THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY- WOULD NO LONGER BE NECESSARY HOWEVER IT IS STILL INCLUDED AS PART OF THE- THANK YOU. THANK YOU ORINDA CATCH THAT ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION WHITE HOPE FOR TRIGGER CUT. BY HAD SPOKEN THIS BOOK IN IT WAS THE REAL LINE ITEM. THAT WE ARE THE IT'S TWO REALIGNMENT ITEMS ON KIJIJI THAT WE'RE GOING TO HOLD OPEN BUT THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE TRANSITION YOU WERE GOING TO PROVE HIS BUDGET. FIVE THAT'S THE COMMITTEE WE COURT. OFFICE THEY'RE ALL HERE WHOA ONE THE FIRST. ONE FIVE TWO TWO FIVE IS THE- STOP BEING THE INTO INTO THE STATE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE. WHILE IN CONCERT HE PART OF THAT SINCE THE CAN. TO THE- IN EFFECT THE REALIGNMENT SERVICE WE STOP TAKING ANYONE THE STATE FACILITIES BY JUST EXTENSION THAT MEANS YOU'RE YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT THE COUNTY WOULD BE. MMHM SO THE YOU WOULD NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOU WERE. ALSO YOU NEED SOME OF THESE. SPECIFICS THAT WE WERE DISCUSSING SO THAT'S HOW I SEE THEM LINKED AND THERE THAT'S WHY RECOMMENDING ALTHOUGH SO THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY WE- THE AMOUNT OF JUNE FIFTEENTH THE JUNE FIFTEENTH BUT- IT ALLOWS US TO DO. YOUR LANGUAGE BUT BY BEING A GIVE US MORE TIME RATHER BUT BY IT BY ACTING ON. THE FIVE TWO FIVE ITEM WHICH IS. OUR START BEATING DISTRICT DECISION WE WOULD BAN KI SAYING YES WE WILL- WE WILL REVERSE OUR ACTION THE LAST YEAR. WHICH IS. A D. J. J. INTO A THAT HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES OR THIS NEW. SORRY I. A BEGIN THE PROCESS OF THIS REALIGNMENT. WE WON'T VOTE YET BUT THAT'S WHAT THE THAT'S WHAT WAS ENVISIONED BUT I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT WE PERHAPS MODIFIED THE PREVIOUS BUDGETED. WE COURT. ALEJO'S POINT ABOUT THE ONE SEVEN MILLION. THE ONLY OTHER COMMENT I WOULD TODAY ALEJO'S I THINK THE POINT ABOUT MAKING A SPECIFIC DATE IS GOOD I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE OUT. TO THE COUNTY SPEAK CLEARLY. THE TV- WILL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT JUST HOW THIS INTERFACE WORKS AND SO THE OTHER SPECIFIC THE LA YO RECOMMENDED I'M BY. I A N. NEUTRAL ABOUT AT THE MOMENT IS BECAUSE- I HAVE TO. I WOULD WANT THEM THOUGHT ABOUT IN THAT WHOLE CONTEXT LIKE THERE MAY NOT BE A REASON TO AN INTERVAL OUNTIES IF WE HAVE. THAT WE'RE LOSING. THAT MAY BE THEY HAVE TO DO ANY KIND OF INCENTIVE VISITATION HOWEVER WE MAY NEED TO IF WE'RE STOPPING INTAKE. WE MAY NEED TO THE- MORE SOONER THAN LATER ENSURE THAT THE COUNTIES HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO PROVIDE THE APPROPRIATE SERVICES. SHOP. GO AHEAD SENATOR BILL OF YOU COULD YOU ADD INTO THE MIX. GIVEN THE FACT WE HAVE. HELLO AGING PRISON THAT HAS A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH THE VIRUS SENATE. IF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS IS INTENDING TO. USE THESE FACILITIES THAT ARE MORE MODERN THAT ARE YOU FACILITIES FOR THEIR OWN ADULT PURPOSES THAT SHOULD BE MAYBE. LOOKED OUT. LIKE THE ONE IN CERTAIN STOCKTON IS A LOT. NEWER THAN. THE NEW FACILITY AS A SINGLE PERSON SELF FACILITY THEN THERE'S PART OF IT IS A DORMITORY BUT- I THINK THAT'S- TO DETERMINE WHAT TO DO WITH THE PROPERTY SELL TO. YOU WE CLOSEST HOSPITALS WE HAD A SPECIFIC PLAN THAT WAS PRESENTED TO THE LEGISLATURE THE TRAILER BILL AT THE TIME YOU KNOW IN IMPOSED ON THE PART OF THE- THIS IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF PRESENTING A PLAN TO THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT HOW CLOSE THE FACILITY. THROUGH THE PROCESS. BUT WE HAVE AN THERE'S BEEN NO WORD SPOKEN ABOUT. IF WE'RE GONNA TRANSITION AND CLOSE THESE FACILITIES WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO A WOMAN WHAT THE PER IS A GONER IS THERE GOING TO BE DECLARED SURPLUS OR THEY'RE GOING TO USE FOR. AL'S SOME OF THE- PEOPLE. PERHAPS IN THE FUTURE HAVE A REPORT COME TO THE COMMITTEE OR SOMEHOW GET INFORMATION ABOUT THAT. IF WE'RE CLOSE STATE. THIS. OF IT WE HAVE PRISONS ARE MULTI BILLION DOLLAR OR MAINTENANCE AND REHAB WE MIGHT LOOK AT SOME OF THESE NEWER FACILITIES TO HOUSE SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN THE STATE ADULTS SYSTEM I DON'T KNOW SO WE CAN LOOK. PERHAPS WELL WERE UNDER THIS PRESSURE AT THIS MOMENT YEAH TO ACHIEVE A BUDGET FIGHT ON OUR CONSPIRE CONSTITUTIONAL DEADLINE PERHAPS. ONCE OR BUDGETS ADOPTED WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HAVE A ADDITIONAL HEARING WHERE WE COULD DELVE INTO SOME OF THE SUBJECTS AND- GET A LITTLE MORE COLDER ENGAGEMENT ALSO AND ALSO HAVE HAD THE ABILITY THINK ABOUT A LITTLE MORE. AND THAT IT COULD HELP US OUR WITH OUR- THOUGHT PROCESS ON THE TV A LANGUAGE. AND ADDITIONALLY WE MIGHT CONSIDER SOME OF THE THINGS RELATED TO COPE WITH THAT WE STE THAT WE JUST BROUGHT UP IN DISCUSSION WHEN WE OPENED THE HEARING. BUT FOR WHICH THERE'S NOT A. PARTICULAR ITEM WITHIN HERE FOR US TO SAY E. MODIFIER OR HAVE BEEN HAVE AN IMPACT ON THAT AND SINCE I CAN I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT THE VIRUS WILL NOT BE OVER WITH BY THE WEEK AFTER JUNE FIFTEENTH BUDGET ADOPTION WE- IT'S PROBABLY JUST AS RELEVANT TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION. HEARING SOMETIME THEREAFTER. GO AHEAD SENATOR MORE LACKEY THANK YOU MANAGER I GET THE SENSE FROM REVIEW OF THE MATERIAL THAT. YOU KNOW TRYING TO GET SOME. I JUNE FIFTEENTH. ALSO HAVE TRAILER BACK TO FILL BILLS FROM THE LANGUAGE ARE WE LOOKING THEN IT MAY BE SOMETIME IN AUGUST DOING THIS CAN BUDGET. TO MODIFY WHAT WE DID TO MEET THE CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS. I THIS TIME I'M I'M JUST TRYING TO GET WELL I OF COURSE THAT IS FROM WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND I'M ABOUT DAYS I COULD I CAN LAUGH AND SAY IT'S ABOVE MY PAY GRADE BUT- I WOULD SAY THAT WE HAVE A CONSTANT. PUBLIC TO ADOPT IT ONCE BUT- DOLLAR ME. BY THAT DATE. DOOR CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION DOES NOT REQUIRE US TO HAVE LANDED ON ALL OF THE SPECIFIC POLICY PARTS WHICH ARE WHAT WE INCORPORATE INTO A. T. B. L. IN BECAUSE THIS ITEM. IF WE COMPARE SOME OF THE OTHER ITEM IN THIS PACKET. ARE JUST CHANGES IN EXPENDITURES THEY'RE NOT CHANGES IN POLICY THIS ITEM HOWEVER BECAUSE WE LAST YEAR WE DECIDED TO. MOVE DAY G. D. J. J. OUT OF CORRECTIONS IN INTO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. AND LEAVE OUR AWARDS THE STATE FACILITIES. NOW WE HAVE BEFORE US NOT ONLY A DOLLAR CHANGE BUT A VERY SICK POLICY CHANGE SO WHAT I WAS DESCRIBING IS THAT. WE COULD TEN INCH LAN ON. THE DOLLAR CHAIN. BY OUR CONSTITUTIONAL DODD LINE BUT GIVE US SOME MORE TIME TO LAND ON THE ALL OF THE POLICIES ASSOCIATED WITH IT. NOW WHETHER PASS JUNE FIFTEENTH THERE ARE OTHER BUDGET ACTIONS THAT RELATE TO DOLLARS I THINK IS MUCH MORE TO DO WITH FOR EXAMPLE WHETHER OUR- REVENUES IN TWO. FROM WHEN THAT PLEASE WHEN HE MOVED TO THE DATE INCOME TAX FILINGS AND IF THE REVENUES GO WAY LOWER THAN PROJECTED I WOULD IMAGINE. IN PASSED FROM MY PAST EXPERIENCE SO IT WILL BE ABLE LOOKING AT OUR BUDGET BUT A- I YOU KNOW NOW WE MAY BE. DOING DAHLE. AFTER THAT A JUNE DEADLINE BUT WE MAY BE DOING SEVENTY BE OUT ONCE SAID HELP LITTLE BIT OKAY. THE RESULT. YEAH OKAY. BOB. ALL RIGHT- AND. WE HAVE A HAND UP HELLO YES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOU HAVE YOUR HAND UP. WE HAVE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENT AT THIS TIME THANK YOU OKAY. SO THOSE WERE JUST THE DJJ ITEMS THERE'S A COUPLE OF OUR OTHER ITEMS WITHIN THIS DISCUSS ART. FIVE THE. THE OTHER ONE THE REPORT FOR DISCUSSION WAS THE- RECOMMENDATION THE MAY REVISE FOR. THE CAP ON PAROLE WHICH IS WOULD. PROVIDE US SOME SAVINGS REDUCTIONS AND- ON. I WAS- I WELCOME TO THIS PROPOSAL BECAUSE THE ACROSS THE COUNTRY BOTH SPECIFIC CALIFORNIA'S ACROSS THE US SHOWS THAT FOR MOST PAROLEES TWENTY FOUR MONTHS IS ALL THAT'S REALLY NEEDED FOR- FOR THAT SUPERVISION AND THAT. THOSE WHO- WHO HAVE NOT MADE MODIFICATIONS THEIR CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR DEMONSTRATE THAT BEFORE- TWENTY FOUR MONTHS OR WITHIN A TWENTY FOUR MONTH PERIOD- SO THE ACTUALLY GIVEN THE TYPE OF DEFICIT WERE FACING. I WOULD JUST COMMENT THAT FOR EXAMPLE DURING THE LAST RECESSION. SWEPT SOMETHING THAT MANY MANY FOLKS MENDED BUT WAS NOT DONE SO WE WERE NOT ABLE TO ACHIEVE. THINGS THROUGH SUCH CHANGE LIKE THIS BUT INSTEAD WE BASICALLY ELIMINATE ALL REHABILITATIVE PROGRAM. THAT WAS HOW WE GOT SOME SAVINGS BACK IN LAST RECESSION IN THE- WE HAVE TO SEE THAT IN. PARTICULAR MEETING THIS MAY REVISED THERE'S NOT A WHOLE SALE JUST ELIMINATION OF OUR REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS I AM AWARE HOWEVER THERE ARE LACKS THAT ARE HAPPY WITH JUST BECAUSE KOBE BECAUSE WE'RE- BUT COME. SO RIGHT NOW BUT THE REASON I WANTED TO DISCUSS IT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE. THE LEGISLATURE HAS PUT INTO STATUTE. THE ABILITY FOR UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS FOR ELDERLY PAROLE MEDICAL PAROLE AND SOME COMPASSIONATE RELEASE. AND AS I PUT. SINCE THE STATUTES WERE APPROVED AND THEY WERE PROVED OVER AND IT'S BEEN AT LEAST EIGHT YEARS THERE BEEN VERY VERY FEW PEOPLE IN OUR FACILITIES WHO WERE WHO HAVE BEEN IT- TO ALLOW. TO USE THOSE STATUTORY PROVISIONS AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE DATA WE FOR EXAMPLE HAVE AT LEAST ONE AND MAYBE MORE. OF COURSE READ AN INDIVIDUAL FOR NOW IN HOSPICE. AND THAT MEANS THAT WE HAVE- FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND EIGHT HI WE ALSO HAVE SOME THAT ARE. COMPLETELY INCAPACITATED IN IN HOSPITAL TYPE SETTINGS AND IT BE PERMANENTLY AND THE REQUIRE A WHOLE DIFFERENT LEVEL OF. OF OUR TO PROVISION. THIS IS EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH AND I FIND IT ESPECIALLY DURING A TIME OF CODED WHERE IF I WERE THE STAFF I WOULD NOT WANT TO BE IN A HOSPITAL SETTING HAVING TO PARK SOMEONE. AND I SO. I FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR US TO. FOR STAFF TO LOOK AT WHAT WERE THE INADEQUACIES IN THOSE STATUTES. THAT HAVE LED TO SO FEW INDIVIDUALS OVER THAT PERIOD OF TIME. BEING PROVIDED EITHER MEDICAL OR L. LEE PAROLE WHEN IF WE LOOK AT THE HEALTH COSTS. SO WHAT THE- IN THE C. C. OUR BUDGETING TERMS OF OUR EXPENDITURES OVER THE LAST FIVE TO SIX YEARS. IN THE HEALTH COSTS NOW PART OF THAT IS DUE TO FEDERAL COURT ORDER THAT REQUIRED US TO PROVIDE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF HEALTH TO A COMPLETELY PRIEST THAT. THE PART OF IT THIS JUST LIKE IN THIS. AT LARGE YOU HAVE A SMALL PER PEOPLE THAT. HELLO CONDITIONS CAUGHT THE GREAT. HEALTHCARE COSTS SAME AS IN THE- AND WHEN WE YOU LOOK AT THE AGE PRO. OF SOME OF OUR SO. WE HAVE PEOPLE EIGHTY SOME. COULD IT. AND THERE NOT ALL OF THOSE ARE A GREAT TO BUT THERE'S MANY THAT HORRID COST TO US IN OF THERE THE MOST MEDICALLY. NOW UNDER CO IT SO IT SEEMS TO GIVE THAT THERE THE- IT MAY. WAS PUTTING FOR. CHANGE AND FOR ALL THAT WE MY LOOK AT. THE STATUTES. AND SEE WHAT THE- WHAT INADEQUACIES EXIST IN THE THAT IF CAUSED THEM NOT TO QUITE A CHIU WHAT THE- INTENT WAS SO THAT WAS MY HOPE AND SEE IF BY AGAIN. THE NO WAY WHICH BEFORE US BECAUSE ALL OF IS WHAT YOU KNOW WE DON'T ALL THE CAME VERY QUICKLY AND SO. STAFF FOR DISK IT. THE JUST IS THAT. SENATOR BILL. CORD THE THIS IS ISSUE AS YOU POINTED OUT. OF SPECIALLY THE AND GIVE THE SEARCH THAT WERE IN WHERE WE HAVE. THE HI WRISTS FROM. AS A DETERRENT PAUL HEALTH PEOPLE HIGH RISK PATIENTS. IN A THIRD. AB AND THEN BE HAVE WE YOU SAY THOUSAND PEOPLE SO FIRST THAT HAVE THE SO I WOULD SAY THIS IS LIKE. BROUGH IF WE DON'T DO WEEK BE THE LOW BIT. BUT I'M I'M- DAD PROBABLY IS. I DON'T THINK WE OUGHTA ROSS AT THE ABOUT ON STAFF I MEAN YOU YOU HAD A PERSON NOT THAT WE'D BE A TO CHANGE AS FAST ENOUGH SO. IF THERE'S A CO PATIENT BUT YOU KNOW IF ONE THE IT. WHO A CARBON. THEN PUT ON OF IT BITTER. SEEN IS THAT WHAT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WANT THEIR AND- DURING. IT BY AND LARGE THE INTO. ARE INTO BAITED. CUT THE PERCENTAGE YOUR RECOVERY DOWN. DO YOU IMAGINE BE THIS WHO HAVE TO BE IN THE- IN. WORE A. IS IT CHEATING WHAT WE INTENDED. SO SIR MOORLACH WITH CDC ARE. WERE WERE JUST FACING NOW JUST A MASSIVE. QUICK MODIFICATION TO. ECONOMIC TIMES- BUT WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT SYSTEMIC ISSUES- ANALYZING KNOW WHAT CAN WE DO TO IMPROVE. ENTIRE SYSTEM. THE LAST TWO YEARS WE'VE AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY APPROVED BILLS THAT. PROHIBITS THE USE PRIVATE PRISONS COMPLETELY. MAYBE IN GOOD TIMES THAT'S OKAY. BUT IN TOUGH TIMES THE PRICE DIFFERENTIAL PER YEAR OF WHAT IT TAKES TO. HOUSE IN IN MADE A STATE PRISON VERSUS A PRIVATE FACILITY. HIS RATHER DRAMATIC. ALMOST FIFTY WITH FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. SO IF YOU WERE TO MOVE TEN THOUSAND. INMATES TO PRIVATE FACILITY SHOULD SAVE A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS. AND SO I DON'T KNOW HOW A DISCUSSION LIKE THAT WOULD START BUT SOME OF THE SYSTEM MAKE BRING SAID. MAYBE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SHOULD SHOULD LOOK AT WHAT WHAT CAN WE FIX NOW. THAT WOULD CARRY OVER- AN AFFRONT TO SEVEN MONDAY IN THE BUDGET AND FISCAL REVIEW COMMITTEE WHAT. WHAT CAN WE DO TO NEGOTIATE DOWN RETIREE MEDICAL. WHEN I WAS A SUPERVISOR WHO WE NEGOTIATED WITH THE BARGAINING UNITS AND WE REDUCED OUR IN FRONT OF LIABILITY BY 71% THEY AGREED TO IT. WE DID THAT HERE AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT WE'RE PROBABLY TALKING SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS WE COULD REDUCE. AND THAT WOULD FREE UP A LOT OF MONEY FOR. SCHOOL YOU SEE AN- SYSTEM AND YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU KNOW SOMEHOW SOMEWHERE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE A LOOK AT WHAT CAN WE DO UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THAT WILL HELP US IN THE FUTURE THE PENSION PLAN WILL COME BACK IN HIS HEART AND TWO OR THREE YEARS. THE WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS VICE GRIP THAT'S COMMON YOU KNOW AND SO I JUST REGULAR MANAGER JUST AS WE LOOK AT HOW WE RUN CALIFORNIA'S AS COMPARED TO THE OTHER OTHER PRACTICES IN A WHERE CAN WE TAKE A HARD LOOK AND MAKE SOME. CHANGES TO REALLY FIX SOME STE. BEING AS A AS COULD BE. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME BROACH THAT SUBJECT CERTAINLY. SO THE- FINAL ITEM ON THIS PART OF OUR DISCUSSION WAS- AGAIN WHEN I PULLED FOR DISCUSSION WHICH IS THE THAT A REVISION. BUT HAS SOME RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE GOOD CONDUCT CREDIT EARNINGS AND- IT I WOULD. I WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT PART OF THE INTEREST THERE IS THAT IF GIVEN THAT THIS BUDGET IS PREDICATED ON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DESCRIBED ITS PERPETRATED ON THE- ABILITY TO. CLOSE SOME OF. FACILITIES WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS. AND CLEAR THREE FIVE YEARS IF YOU IF WE HAVE THE SAME POPULATION. TODAY IF WE HAVE THE SAME POPULATION IN THREE YEARS THAT WE HAVE TO DAY THAT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO CHEAT SO- SOME OF IT IS AROUND IMPROVING OUR REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING AND GIVING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE. IT WENT STRAIGHT. BUT THEIR SKILLS AND SAY. THAT DISALLOWED THEM TO EARN THOSE ADDITIONAL CREDITS TO EITHER EARLIER TIME TO GO BEFORE THE PROBE ORDER EARLY RELEASE. OUT ON THE REASON WHEN THE PUBLIC WAS FIVE I A SUPPORT IT BUT I. WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO SEE THE LANGUAGE OF EXACTLY HOW THAT CAN BE ACHIEVED THERE THERE WILL DEBATE THING WAS THREE YEARS AGO AROUND WHAT. THE WHAT THINGS COULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR CREDIT IT'S PROP FIFTY SEVEN IS BROAD AND THERE WERE AND WHAT WAS WE DID ON WAS FROM SOME FOLKS HAVE POINT OF VIEW YOU KNOW DO NOT IT WAS IT WAS A RATHER. THERE WAS MORE. AND SO. I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND AGAIN WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO. RESOLVE IT FULLY BEFORE OUR I DO BUDGET OPTION BUT THAT WE HAVE- A GOOD A ROBUST PROCESS AROUND. WHAT THINGS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR CREDIT AND WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS FOR. KING THOSE CREDITS. SELF THAT WAS SEVEN AND WE HAVE BEEN LA- COMMENT I BELIEVE ON THIS GO AHEAD- MISSONI OLD. THANK YOU I JUST A COUPLE POINTS ON THIS ISSUE THAT I WANTED TO RAISE- THE FIRST IS A TECHNICAL BUDGETING ISSUE AND THE SECOND IS A BIG PICTURE ISSUE I'M ON THE TECHNICAL ISSUE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S CORES SOME SAVINGS IN THAT BUDGET YEAR ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR POPULATION REDUCTION THAT IS ESTIMATED TO RESULT FROM THESE CREDIT CHANGES. I'M AND THAT DOES CHANGE. THOSE SAVINGS DON'T ACCOUNT FOR SAVINGS AN INMATE HEALTHCARE COSTS SO WE- THE MEAT THAT THE SAVINGS COULD BE HERE ABOUT ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS GREATER IN THE BUDGET YEAR. AND THEN THE SECOND ISSUE IS THE BIG PICTURE ISSUE THAT I WANTED TO MENTION- IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES THAT THE CHANGES. INCORRECT ERNIE. THIS YOUR FROZE WE DON'T HEAR YOU RIGHT NOW SHE'S FROZE WHICH NAME AND FORM A COUPLE. OF. RIGHT NOW YOU'RE NOW YOU'RE SURE YOU JUST NEED TO THE BLACK LITTLE IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU'RE SET UP ON OKAY. GREAT SORRY ABOUT THAT- SO IRATE DID YOU HEAR ME DISCUSS THE ONE POINT TWO MILLION AND ADDITIONAL STEPS. YES OKAY. GREAT AND SO THEN MOVING ON TO THE BIG PICTURE ISSUE WHICH IS THAT- BE ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES THAT THAT POPULATION REDUCTION ASSOCIATED WITH THESE- CHANGES TO GOOD CONDUCT CREDIT EARNING- RATES WOULD REDUCE. IRAN NINETY HUNDRED INMATES IN THREE TWENTY FOUR WHICH IF YOU COMBINE THAT WITH THAT PROPOSED CHANGES TO RECEPTION CENTER PROCESS THESE WHICH WOULD ALSO REDUCE. GEN WE'D BE LOOKING AT A ROUGHLY ELEVEN THOUSAND INMATE REDUCTION BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR IN ADDITION TO THE ON GOING DECLINE IN THE POPULATION THAT JUST IN CASE FIND TREND- AND SO. THIS DATA LEVIN THOUSAND ADDITIONAL DECLINE WOULD ALLOW FOR FURTHER PRISON CLOSURES BEYOND IT TO THAT THE GOVERNOR- HAS INDICATED HE WOULD CALL. I'M AND SO THIS COULD CHANGE THE COMPOSITION OF THE INMATE POPULATION. AND FOR HER AND ATTACK- CHANGE OR REDUCE THE NEED- FOR CERTAIN CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS THAT ARE TIED TO THE INMATE POPULATION LIKE THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS BEDS PROPOSED OR MEDICATION DISTRIBUTION GROUNDS FOR EXAMPLE- IT WOULD AND SO FOR THAT REASON- AND FOR THE REASON OF. BECAUSE PRESENTS THE ADMINISTRATION HASN'T BEEN IDENTIFIED PRISONS OR CLOSURE IN THE NEAR TERM. WE RECOMMEND- HOLDING OFF ON AND- INFRASTRUCTURE PAPA ALL INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSALS AND TELL THOSE PRESENT ARE IDENTIFIED AND THE STATE HAS A BETTER SENSE OF HOW TO POPULATION REDUCTIONS WOULD AFFECT THE COMPOSITION AND INMATES AND THE NEED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THEN I ALSO- TO MENTION THAT IF YOU WOULD- MY COLLEAGUES HAD COMMENTS ON THE TERMS THAT HE BE HAPPY T SHARE IF YOU LIKE. AND BEFORE WE GO TO THE- BOBBI GET TAKE OUTLAY DISCUSSION WE'VE GOT THAT IS PULLED ITS NEXT ISSUE. BUT HI I WOULD RAISE THAT IT- DE LA DID A REPORT ON PROP FIFTY SEVEN CREDITS BACK I THINK TO WHY DON'T KNOW PLEASE TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO AND THEY IDENTIFIED OPPORTUNITIES WERE. IT'S AN OF THAT WERE NOT INCORPORATED IN WHAT. WHAT WE'RE NOT INCORPORATED IN WHAT THE LEGISLATURE DID THE CDC OURS PROGRAM AND WHAT WAS IN THAT FINAL BUDGET AND SO I THINK IT'S THIS IS PART OF WHY I. DID STAFF TO RE LOOK AT IT AND THEY I THINK THEY SHOULD GO BACK TO LA OWES REPORT BECAUSE THERE WAS GOOD EXTENSIVE WORK THAT WAY- REPORT. THAT WE MAY ONE INCORPORATE IN THE BACKUP FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IF IT'S NOT THERE. A SO THE- WAY COMMENT IS IT ON VISA FOR CAP OUTLAY SINCE CAPITAL A OUTLAYS NEXT. BY THE OTHER COMMENT RELATED TO THAT PEARL TERMS OKAY FILTERS ARE A GO AHEAD. MY FROM MY COLLEAGUE LUKE LUKE GO AHEAD. YEAH SECOND BY FAILING. THE USER YES WE CAN HEAR YOU WE'RE JUST COMMON THAT IF THE LEGISLATURE WAR TO APPROVE THIS PROPOSAL FOR A PAROLE TERMS- THERE MIGHT BE ADDITIONAL SAY ABOUT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS- DUTIES. RISING INDIVIDUALS NOT HAVING BEEN ADJUSTED FOR- FOR EXAMPLE THE COULD BE SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT WITH YOUR INDIVIDUALS ON ELECTRONIC MONITORING. THANK YOU. OKAY GREAT WE LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT OTHER POTENTIAL SAVINGS. ALRIGHT SO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOU WANT A COMIC GO AHEAD. THANK YOU ROBERT NELSON PART OF FINANCE. ON THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION LIST ON THE WHICH WE DID HEAR THAT ON THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION FOR THE GOOD CREDIT YES REFERENCE I TT ALL WORK WITH US CLARIFYING. YEAH YEAH THERE WAS IT MANY TIMES RETROACTIVITY I WOULD CONTACT CREDIT SHE PRIVATE. SHOULD BE UP BASED ON WHAT THEY BIRD VERSUS GOING BACK AND CHECKING FOR THIS YEAR ASKREDDIT. I'M WELL THAT WILL HAVE TO BE CUT FURTHER DISCUSSED BECAUSE THAT HAS BEEN AN ISSUE- ONGOING ENACT. BUT CURRENTLY- THERE ARE FACILITIES THAT FIVE BASICALLY WE IT WOULD THERE ARE INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS WHO PLEADED PROGRAM MAX FOR EXAMPLE WHETHER IT'S AN EDUCATION RATHER. AND THEN THEY WERE TOLD OKAY THIS WHAT DO WE DON'T HAVE GOOD NEVER OCCURRED SO YOU CAN'T USE THAT AS A CREDIT FOR FIFTY SEVEN BUT THEN WHEN THEY GO TO RE APPLY FOR THAT PROGRAM. BECAUSE THEY WANT TO ENABLE IT TO BE A CREDIT THERE TOLD NO YOU CAN'T TAKE THE PROGRAM AGAIN BECAUSE YOU ALREADY TOOK IT SO WE CAN HAVE A DOUBLE STANDARD WE CAN'T HAVE IT WHERE YOU THAT THE SYSTEM HAS THE RECORD THAT THEY TOOK THE PROGRAM. BUT DâN DOES NOT ALLOW THEM TO CREDIT FOR SUCH PROGRAMS OF THOSE RULES THAT'S ONE OF THE USE AMONG OTHERS. SO WE JUST WANT TO A- MAKE SURE THOSE. HAVE THAT DISCUSSION TO MAKE SURE SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE PROPERLY ACCOUNTED FOR. ALSO LIKE TO COMMENT ON. ADDITIONAL SAVINGS AND WE ARE WORKING WITH A PARTY THAT REASSESSED YOU FALLS YOU BECAUSE CORTISOL STADIUMS OKAY GREAT. ALRIGHT SO THAT WAS THOSE GO AHEAD SENATOR ABOUT JUST JUST ON GOOD CONDUCT CREDIT GUESTS. IT SEEMS LOGICAL THAT GOOD CONDUCT IS. GOOD TO HAVE IN OUR STATE PRISON SYSTEM SO ANY KIND OF SYSTEM THAT INCENTIVIZE THAT WOULD BE WELCOME I WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT- IT SHOULD BE EQUALLY APPLIED TO PEOPLE THAT HAVE MENTAL HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AS WELL AS OTHERS BECAUSE- OF SOME. THE PEOPLE IN THE CATEGORIES IN THE FACILITIES. DON'T HAVE THIS LEVEL OF OPPORTUNITIES. TO GET THE CRAP THAT'S SO THAT I HOPE THAT IT'S EQUALLY APPLIED FOR OR ALLOW YOU KNOW THEY HAVE PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW PEOPLE THAT MENTAL HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES TO GET GOOD CONDUCT CREDITS- I THANK YOU FOR THAT AND THOUGH THE LEVEL OF CONTROL THAT THEY WOULD. UNDER WOULD BE PASSIVE FOR. LESS BEHAVIOR CHALLENGED WAY IN THE FACILITIES. SO THAT WOULD ADDITIONALLY INDIRECTLY SAVE US. MONEY AND IT WOULD BE EASIER FOR THE STAFF TO OPERATE OR FACILITIES. OKAY SHOW TIMES WE WILL MOVE ON SINCE WE ARE NOT VOTING TWO BILLION THEN WE'LL NOW GO TO ISSUE ONE SEVENTEEN THIS IS THE- VARIOUS CAPITAL OUTLAY AND- THE REASON YOU WANT TO DISCUSS THIS ONE WE DON'T HAVE TO GET INTO. AN EARLY. WE KNOW THAT OF MOST NOT ALL BUT MOST EXCEPT FOR THE MOST THE NEWEST- OUR FACILITIES ARE AGE TODAY HAVE. AREAS NEEDS WHETHER ITS ROOF SURVEY YOU KNOW HOW A WHOLE VARIETY OF THINGS THAT OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE- ROLL OUT LATE IN THERE WE OBVIOUSLY NEED TO MOVE ON. APPROVING SOMEWHAT CAPITAL DAYS OF FOR THOSE FACILITIES- IMPROVEMENTS. HOWEVER WHAT I THINK MOST OF US WANTED TO DO WAS ENSURE THAT. WE ARE IN A SITUATION WE ARE AUTHORIZING A SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURE ON A FACILITY WE INTEND TO CLOSE WITHIN TWO YEARS SO- I EIGHT I AM NOT INTO. THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE PART IN A FINANCE WOULD SAY TO US TO DAY OKAY THE EARTH SO THESE WE ARE CLOSING BUT WHAT I WOULD HOPE THAT BEFORE. TOO BACK TO RAISE THE- YOU KNOW THAT THE ONES. ANY BIG TICKET ITEMS ARE FOR FACILITIES THAT ARE IN TEND TO BE DATA. WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO UTILIZE. ON BUT CERTAINLY WE CAN HEAR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GO AHEAD CENTER ROW YOU WANNA MAKE TOM AT FIRST WHEN I LOOK AT THIS I LOOK AT THE SAFETY OF THE- STAFF IN THE- INMATES FROM THE VIRUS AND- I WOULD ASSUME IF WE WERE VERY DIRECTLY RELATED TO THAT. THAT THE OF AT SOME POINT WE CAN- A REIMBURSEMENT SO. I JUST WANT A- THROW THAT IN THERE. BECAUSE OF pITS THE SAFETY OF THE- STAFF. AND INMATES IT'S DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE VIRUS I THINK THAT COULD BE. POSSIBLY A WE MET WOULD HAVE A BETTER CASE AT LEAST FOR REQUESTING A FOR REIMBURSEMENT THANK YOU. GOOD POINT GOOD POINT- DEPARTMENT FINANCE DID YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY COMMENT. NOT NECESSARY TO DON'T. I WAS IN A POINT OUT THAT THERE'S MANY CONSIDERATIONS THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE- CLOSE. DURATION AND- OR EVEN THOUGH SINCE YOU START LOOKING AT. NOW IT WAS CLOSE YOU'RE SORT OF THE DEFINITION YOUR POINTS THE CARD. THIRTY SEVEN MY PROPOSALS TO HOLD IT OPEN JUST BECAUSE- AGAIN LA- WOULD LIKE TO KNOW EXACTLY WHICH CLOSED BEFORE AND ARE NOT. I YOU KNOW I SUPPOSE I'M A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBLE I DID LEAST WANT TO KNOW ANYTHING WE ARE. PUTTING SIZEABLE EXPENDITURES TO ONE ON THE TYPE OF THE CAPITAL OUTLAY THAT'S GOT A MULTI YEAR OF A OF A LIFE FOR VALUE THAT WE WOULDN'T BE WE WOULDN'T THERE WE DON'T. APPROVING FOR FACILITIES THAT WE INTENDED TO AT LEAST. OKAY SELF WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ITEM ONE EIGHTEEN. AND THAT ITEM IS- pBRANCH AND IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS APPROVED. IN THE PAST TO ALLOW FOR- AND THE JUDICIAL BRANCH TO. THAT WHEN YOU HAVE FOLKS WHO ARE HE HAVE INFRACTIONS OR OTHER THINGS THAT. REALLY ARE NOT IT THE- TO USE THE WORD AND DID YOU ANYWAY UNABLE TO PAY THAT THERE WOULD BE- THE COURTS WOULD BE ABLE TO. CAMPBELL THAT MORE EFFICIENTLY WITH AN ON LINE TOOL INSECTS AND- THIS THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES AN EXPANSION OF THAT WHICH I THINK IN PRINCIPLE AS MUCH AS I AM HESITANT TO AUTHORIZE ANY NEW GENERAL FUND DOLLARS I THINK YOU'VE GOT PROBABLY MANY MANY PEOPLE RIGHT NOW. BE FACING AN END OF THE DAY HEY BUT THERE WAS SOME DETAIL. AROUND THE- YOUR BILL TO INSURE THAT THIS WEEK AND- HE A THAT IT MEETS THE STATUTORY INTENT THAT WAS INTENDED IN WHEN THIS WHOLE SYSTEM WAS GOING TO BE YOU KNOW WHEN LAUNCHED AND- I'M SURE WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM SOME PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS A I'M JUST TRYING TO. NOTES FOR A MINUTE IF I HAD ANY FOR. BUT. ONE THING ABOUT- HAVING OUR PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END WE IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO BUT ANYWAY THAT'S- SO I THINK IT'S MOSTLY TRAILER BILL. THAT WE WOULD NEED TO YOU KNOW HAVE SOME GET INTO SOME DETAIL ABOUT. NOT NECESSARILY THE EXPENDITURE BUT ON MY STAFF THE LA- HAS A COMMENT OKAY GO AHEAD LA YOU. ON THIS PROPOSAL- WE ARE ACTUALLY RECOMMENDING THE LEGISLATURE REJECTS THE PROPOSAL- IN THIS IS BECAUSE THE IMPACTS OF THE TOOL ARE STILL UNCERTAIN BECAUSE OF THE PILOT PROGRAM. KEY THIS YEAR ME AND AS I WAS AND GETTING A NOTE SAYING THAT YOU'RE TIãU WE ARE TO. I'M SORRY- SO I CONTINUED MY- THE IMPACTS OF THE ONLINE EDUCATION TOOL ARE STILL UNCERTAIN BECAUSE IT'S A PILOT. AND IT COULD REQUIRE MORE PAYING THEM. AND IT'S ALSO PREMATURE TO EXPAND THE TOLD PRIOR TO THE COMPLETE TEN. STATUTORILY REQUIRED EVALUATION OF THE PART WHICH WOULD NO LONGER BE REQUIRED UNDER THE PROPOSAL SH IT'S FOR A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON THAT. THROUGH THE END OF DECEMBER THE FOR. EIGHT I'LL PORTS. IMPLEMENTED THE ABILITY TO PAY COMPONENTS AND THE OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO BE TESTED ARE NOT GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED UNTIL THE END OF TWENTY- AND- TWENTY. THERE'S REALLY BLACK TWENTY EIGHT OF ANY OF THE COURTS SH. SO THIS HE HAS YOU KNOW THERE AND THIRTY IN TERMS OF THE ON THE COURT USERS ALSO ALL THE IMPACTS. HAVE UPON THE VARIOUS STATE LOCAL FINDS. BY THE CAR. AND THE TAX THAT IS INCLUDE FOR THAT TRIAL COURTS OVER THE DIGITAL RASH COULD ACTUALLY BE HIGHER THAN WHAT CURRENTLY IDENTIFY WE JUST WANTED TO PUT THOSE- COMMENTS OUT THERE THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE. ARI EXPECTED BECAUSE I DID READ THAT COMMENT BY THE LA- AND IT MAY BE APPROPRIATE TO POTENTIALLY LIMIT THE EXPANSION DEPENDING ON- WHAT MORE WE MAY LEARN AROUND CERTAIN OF THE COURTS. BUT I THINK TO ELIMINATE IT RIGHT NOW AT THE POINT WHERE WE HAVE. AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE INABILITY TO PAY- DOES NOT MAKE A LOT OF SENSE TO ME SO. BUT CLEARLY WILL HAVE THEIR SOME DETAILS THAT STILL HAVE TO BE. WORKED OUT DOES ANYONE ELSE HAVE ANY COMMENTS. OKAY THN WE WILL MOVE ON TO THE- NEXT ITEM WHICH IS DOJ DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THAT IS ON. THERE IS A- TWO ISSUES IN DOJ THAT WERE RELATED TO THE- TESTING OF SEXUAL EVIDENCE. THERE WAS ONE THAT WAS. IS NEW MONEY NEW MONEY TO IMPLEMENT SB TWENTY TWO WHICH ARE. BASICALLY HAS SOME NEW REQUIREMENTS AROUND THIS THE TESTING OF SEXUAL EVIDENCE- BUT THEN THERE IS THE SECOND ITEM WHICH IS A RE VERSION OF- MONIES THAT WERE APPROVED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET THAT WOULD HELP THOSE JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE A BIG BACKLOG. SO I FOUND IT INTERESTING ON THE HAND YES IT IS TRUE WE HAVE A GENERAL FUND DEFICIT AND CERTAINLY WE NEED LOOK FOR EFFICIENCIES COST SAVINGS BUT THAT WE WOULD BE DIVERSITY. ONE DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT HELPED US INSURER. THE TESTING OF THE THIS SEXUAL EVIDENCE AND YET WE WOULD BE THAT FINDING ANOTHER ACTIVITY THAT MIGHT HELP SO THEY SEEM TO I MEAN I WOULDN'T CALL IT CONTRA THREE BUT CERTAINLY- TWO MILLION. IT WILL NOT WIN THE KIND OF DEFICIT WE HAVE ANY DOLLAR AMOUNT WE CAN SAVE IS IMPORTANT BUT I KNOW THAT THE- DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAD ALREADY PUT OUT IN OR IF P. AND THERE WAS A RECENT ARTICLE SHOWING SOME JURISDICTIONS WITH VERY SIGNIFICANT BACK LOADS AND I WOULD EXPECT AND I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT THOSE JURISDICTIONS WOULD FIND FREE GRANTS TO IT THEY GOT RID OF THE DOG. AND I. BUT SO I WOULD PREFER THAT THAT THAT NOT BE REVERTED. AND I'M HAPPY TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY COMMENT FROM EITHER DOJ OR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OR ANYBODY ON THE DíAS. ENTER SKINNER THIS IS AT THE DRAMA CHIEF ADDITIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT I'D LIKE TO ASK- THE DIRECTOR BUREAU FIREARMS VERY MILLER TO PROVIDE. ARE THESE TWO THE TWO ITEMS WERE DISCUSSING ARE ON THE SEXUAL EVIDENCE. EXACTLY OKAY. RIGHT YES HELLO SORRY CAN YOU HEAR ME THIS IS VERY MILLER FROM THE BUREAUCRATIC SERVICES. YES WE CAN HEAR YOU GO HEAD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- AS FAR AS THE- THE FIRST ITEM AND- ITS RELATION TO THE SECOND ITEM WE SUBMITTED THOSE IS TO SEPARATE- ENTITIES THE RIVERS AND THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT HAS TO DO WITH MONEY THAT WAS. AND TO DO TO GET TO ON LOCAL DURING. OUR AS GRANTS TO HELP SUBMIT AND TEST THAT EVIDENCE IN AS YOU- POINTED OUT WE DO HAVE IN OUR STAY OUT THERE FOR THE LOCALS TO. AND THAT MONEY. THIS FISCAL YEAR. THE FIRST ITEM- WAS ACTUALLY IN RESPONSE TO LEGISLATION SB TWENTY TWO AND A SPECIFICALLY GEARED TOWARDS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. BASED ON AN EVALUATION THAT WE DID OF THE INCREASE IN SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE THAT THE DEPARTMENT WOULD SEE ONLY OUR SERVICE AREA AND I NEED RELATED TO- TESTING THAT ANTICIPATED INCREASED. THE NIGHT- M. I DIDN'T THE- HEY I DIDN'T COMMUNICATE EVERYTHING THAT WAS ON MY MIND BUT PARTLY IT WAS I KNOW THAT FORTUNATELY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE LABS HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB AND THEY DON'T HAVE A BACKLOG IN THE AGENCIES THAT YOU SERVER SO THAT YOUR LEG SIR ALSO AS FAR AS I KNOW DO NOT HAVE ACKLOGS. IT IS A OTHER AGENTS THAT DO AND THAT'S WHY I FEEL IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO RETAIN THE MONEY THAT YOU JUST PUT THE ARE PAY OUT ON EMPLOYMENT. TO BE TWENTY TWO AYE SIR WANT THAT IMPLEMENT BUT GIVEN THAT THE THIRTY J. FAR AS I KNOW THE BACKLOG SOME TIME BY COUPLE SNAPPLE IT WAS UNCLEAR TO ME WHAT I. F. T. NEED. GIVEN OUR THE FISH POSITION. YES MA'AM SURE- I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND THAT- QUESTION- AND WE- HAVE BEEN CONSISTENTLY WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T EXCEED THE LEGISLATIVE MANDATE HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS FOR THE SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE BUT IT. AND AT THIS TIME WE- LOOKING AT THE INCREASE IN POTENTIAL- SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE WE WOULD SEE IT IT'S LIKELY THAT WOULD START TO PUSH UP AGAINST THAT LINE JUST BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE'RE WORKING AT. CITY AND WE HAVE FOR QUITE SOME TIME. OKAY ALL RIGHT TO BE CONTINUED. OKAY ANY OTHER COMMENT. ALRIGHT SO WE WILL GO TO. YEAH I MEAN I BUT I'M VERY I AM A ONE SAY KUDOS TO DOJ FOR KEEPING UP AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT- WE'RE NOT ADDING F. T. E. I APPRECIATED ON. SEVEN DEPARTMENTS COULD BENEFIT FROM AND I DON'T MEAN TO BE IN TAKING LIGHTED THIS BUT COULD BENEFIT FOR NO FTP GIVEN OUR FINANCIAL POSITION WE ALWAYS HAVE TO LOOK VERY CLOSELY AT THAT POINT. RIGHT TO OWN A MOVE TO THE- LAST ITEM UNDER THIS BUDGET THIS PART OF OUR HEARING. FOR DISCUSSION WHICH HIS BSE.

SO I'D LIKE TO WELCOME THE DIRECTOR OF CAL- YES MARK KILLER DO CHI AND ALSO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WHO WILL BE PARTICIPATING- REMOTELY. SKEWS ME. AND SINCE OUR FIRST ITEM IS- E. S. DIRECTOR GIRL WOULD KILL OUR D. G. DO YOU WANT TO PRESENT THE ITEM. OKAY GROW GOOD AFTERNOON THANKS MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND I WILL BE VERY BRIEF HERE- AS YOU KNOW THE MAY RE. REVISION PROPOSES FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. TO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL PREPAREDNESS MEASURES THE POSTER COMMUNITY RESILIENCY AND BUILT ON THE RESILIENCY INVESTMENT KNOWN AS PS YES. GRANTS IN THIS TWO THOUSAND TWENTY YEAR OR WE EXPECT OUR USE ARE YOU ARE YOU LED POWER SHOT OFF A BRANCH. TO FOR FIRE MITIGATION- EFFORTS TO CONTINUE- AND TO CONTINUE TO BE AN ESSENTIALLY AN IMPACT THE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I WE BELIEVE IT'S IMPERATIVE THE STATE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN MITIGATION ACTIONS THAT WILL REDUCE THE IMPACTS. PREPAREDNESS EFFORTS TO INCREASE READING THIS AND RESPONSE CAPABILITIES TO ENHANCE OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS. WITH THIS ROUND OF FUNDING WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO SOME BUILDING LOCAL CAPABILITIES THROUGH GRANTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT PARTICULAR DURING THIS TIME SPECIAL DISTRICTS. ARE THEY COLLECTIVELY MANAGE MANY CRITICAL LOCAL SERVICES CALIFORNIANS RELY ON SUCH AS WATER AND WASTEWATER WASTE MANAGEMENT HEALTH CARE TRANSPORTATION COMMERCE BURIAL SIX SENTRA. ALL THESE SERVICES WERE DIRECTLY IMPACT IMPACTED BY LAST FALL'S PS PS ADVANCE. WELL I AM WITH THE POTENTIAL OF COVERT NINETEEN IMPACTS OVERLAPPING WITH PS YES ON THIS YEAR AS A STATE WE NEED TO ENSURE THE SERVICES CONTINUE TO OPERATE. LIKE LAST YEAR WHEN DETERMINING WHO SHOULD RECEIVE THE GRANTS. WE WILL A DATA DRIVEN PROCESS WILL FOCUS ON HOLD COMMUNITY NEEDS. AS WELL AS OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS IN MAKING A DECISION. YES CERTAINLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR RECORD YOUR DUTY AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR INCREDIBLE WORK DURING THIS TIME YES IT'S BEEN FOR VERY SICK ROLE I MEAN WE'VE YOU'RE USED TO HEARING FROM YOU DURING HIGH ALL THE FIRE SEASON AND WE- KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE ONE AGAIN. BUT WE'VE ALSO. SENIOR OFFICES GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP TO ALL OF THIS PANDEMIC- IT'S ANY I HAVE SOME COMMENTS ON THIS ITEM ON THE RESILIENCY SHUT DOWN BUT I WOULD SEE MY COLLEAGUES TO GO AHEAD CENTER ONE QUICK QUESTION UNDER SHIRTS ITEM NUMBER THIRTEEN. MODIFICATION OF CALIFORNIA'S EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM- WE ARE. NOW GOING TO HAVE A REPLACEMENT OF A GENERAL FUND LOAN WITH A LOAN FROM THE SCHOOL LAND SPANK FUND ADMINISTERED BY THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION. FOR SEVENTEEN MILLION PLUS AND WE DID GET A CHANCE TO ASK THIS TYPE OF QUESTION ON PARTY BUT SOME OF THESE. FUNDS OF KIND OF ACCUMULATED QUITE A BIT MORE BORROWING FROM THEM AND I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS HOW DOES A- OUT OF THIS LAND FOR AND GET TO. A BUILD UP TO SEVENTEEN MILLION AND IN A YOU KNOW AND- OVER HOW MANY YEARS IN ARE WE- ARE WE CHARGING TOO MUCH ARE WE SUPPOSED TO CHARGE. WHAT IT COSTS AND I'M JUST SORT OF CURIOUS IF I COULD MAYBE USE THIS AS AN EXAMPLE FOR A LOT OF THE OTHER FINE ART SO- THIS ONE WAS ON THE VOTE ON THE CALENDAR BUT WE CAN PULL IT. BECAUSE YOU HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT IT. HOWEVER WE MAY NOT HAVE A STAFF THAT CAN ANSWER IT WE MAY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOU MAY BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD. WELL THIS ONE IS REPLACING ALONE FRONT THIRDS FROM SCHOOL LANDS AND STATE LANDS- IT MINISTERS BUT MARK HOPEFULLY YOU CAN. SO WE'RE GOING TO PULL THIS FROM VOTE ONLY AND ADDED TO THIS DISCUSSION. SO THAT OF A SENATOR MORAL CAN HAVE HIS- QUESTION ADDRESSED- DIRECTOR DEALER D. G. OR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ARE YOU ABLE TO. BUT THIS THIS IS MARK ARCH I'LL DEFER WERE TO FINANCE AND THEY CAN GIVE YOU THE SPECIFICS ON THIS PARTICULAR OUTSIDE. OKAY STEVEN BEDS WITH THE PART OF FINANCE- WHAT WE CAN GET BACK TO SOME OF THE DETAILS I THINK THAT THE NATURE OF THE REVENUE THAT GOES INTO THAT FUND IS A RELATED TO- AT LEAST REVENUE THAT COMES OFF OF LANDS THAT WERE USUALLY GRANT THE- STATE USERS COLIN'S AND- SO WE CAN GET BACK AND SOME OF THE DETAILS FROM THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION AS TO. HOW THAT FELT. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU MEASURE BECAUSE INTERNALLY IN SECTION OUR PARTY WE- CERTAINLY WERE BORROWED FROM SOME FINDS pTHAT RATE. IN CANADA- GENERATED BY FEES THAT ARE COLLECTED SO JUST. LOOK CONCERNING HOW THEY DEVELOP CERTAIN LARGE BALANCES. PROBABLY NICE TO HAVE THEM BUT- MAYBE MAYBE A POLICY SHOULD BE REVIEWED. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU MARK. OKAY SO ON THE- SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO NOTE THAT WE WILL BE. VOTING ON THAT SEPARATELY BECAUSE WE DID PODESTA DISCUSSION SO- BUT LET ME NOW TURN TO THE- PLAN TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT DOWN AND THE- FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND ITEMS. AND LEE AS WE EXPERIENCED IN THE LAST FIRE SEASON NET SO SHOCKED THOSE POWER SHUTDOWNS. REALLY IMPACTED- THEY IMPACTED PEOPLE MEDICALLY THE IMPACTED. EMERGENCY SERVICES THE PACK IMPACTED PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE BECAUSE INTERNET WENT DOWN I MEAN THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS AND STAND. THERE IT WAS IN ELEGANT IN THAT THERE WERE- MANY COMMUNITIES THAT WERE EXPERIENCING SHUT DOWN FOR MANY MORE DAYS THAN PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED WE CERTAINLY KNOW THAT THEY ARE NECESSARY. IF I WITH THE HIGH WINDS CIRCUMSTANCE A HIGH WIND IN A HOT VERY HOT CONDITIONS BUT WE CERTAINLY WANT TO. MAKE SURE THAT WE HEAR THAT IN FIXING YOUR CRISIS WE ARE TO EXACERBATING A CRISIS SO I APPRECIATE THAT THAT'S PART OF WHAT THIS MONEY IS TRYING TO DO. SO WHILE I KNOW THAT IT IS APPROPRIATE THAT THE- SOME NUMBER THE STATE AGENCIES RECEIVE FUNDING. FIVE IF YOU KNOW FOR THIS PURPOSE FOR EXAMPLE ON THE STATE TOTALS- DURING ONE OF THE SHUTDOWNS- THE CALL THE CUT TONAL WAS CALTRANS DID. I DON'T NOT QUITE SURE WHY BUT THEY HAD TO CLOSE THE ENTIRE TUNNEL. BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T COULDN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO YOU HAVE TO BE EXHAUSTED STEM OPERATE. IN THE COURSE THE DANGER OF THAT IS HAD THERE BEEN ANY FIRE- ON THE- OTHER SIDE OF THE TUNNEL WE WOULD HAVE. GIVEN THE WEIGHT THAT THE ROADS IN THAT AREA ARE HE WOULD HAVE COMPLETELY IMPEDED EITHER PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO GET OUT. FOR SOME LEVEL OF ASSISTANCE TO GET IN. SO WE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN SO I'D APPRECIATE THAT WE WOULD NEED POTENTIALLY SOME FUNDING THERE. BUT THERE ARE SOME DOLLAR AMOUNT HERE. I WONDER- WHETHER WE NEED ALL OF THAT TO THOSE STATE AGENCIES AND THE REASON I RAISE THAT IS BECAUSE WHEN I LOOK AT THE COUNTY ALLOCATIONS- I A LOOK AT FOR EXAMPLE- YOU KNOW SOME OF OUR- HI. FIRE AREAS THAT WHILE THEY MAY NOT HAVE EXPERIENCED ABOUT FIRE IN THE LAST TWO COUPLE SEASONS HISTORICALLY THEY HAVE BEEN AREAS WITH THE WORST FIRES. AND YET THERE ALLOCATION. MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE FOR THE NEED ADDITIONALLY I SEE THAT THIS IS ONLY COUNTIES AND NOT SPECIAL DISTRICTS. AND IF WE TAKE AGAIN I'LL BE VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT MY DISTRICT. WHICH HAD THE WORST FIRE PRIOR TO THE SANTA ROSA AND THE- ORDER DID I SAY THAT RIGHT FOR. WHAT WAS THE COMMUNITY IN THE LAST. PARADISE NOT POOR EXCUSE ME DEAD CENTER IS IN PARADISE ENDED UP BEING WORSE THAN THE OAKLAND BERKELEY TOTAL FIRE IN TERMS OF BOTH LIVES LOST IN STRUCTURES DAMAGE AND SUCH BUT FOR A GOOD TWENTY YEARS THERE THAT THE OLD. CALL THE CARD I MEAN THE OAKLAND BERKELEY FIRE WAS THE WORST IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. AND IT'S ONLY JUST A MATTER OF A WIND PATTERNS RELUCTANT WE HAVEN'T HAD ANOTHER ONE THERE AND THE NEXT ONE COULD BE THAT BAD DEAR. AND IT IS THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS THAT OFFER FIRE SERVICES IN THAT AREA. SOME MUCH OF IT IS A LAND FOR EXAMPLE UNDER EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT WHICH HOUSING FIRE DEPARTMENT- MUCH OF THE CELL TOWERS ARE ALSO ON THAT LAND. AND THERE'S JUST THERE ARE CERTAIN SPECIAL DISTRICTS THAT EITHER MANAGE A LOT OF LAND IN THE WE IN THE URBAN WILDLAND INTERFACE. FOR THAT PROVIDE FIRE SERVICES AND SO BASS DATE THEIR ROLE IN THE IN THE POWER SHUT OFF WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY- ARE ADEQUATELY PER AT OUR ADEQUATELY RESOURCE SO THAT THE POWER SHUT OFF DOES NOT IMPEDE THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE. THE EMERGENCY SERVICES THAT THEY PROVIDE SO I JUST RAISE IT BECAUSE THE WAY THIS IS STRUCTURED. THEY WOULD NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ANY OF THESE FUNDS SO I THINK THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF DISCUSSIONS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE. IN TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TRAILER BILL IS DIRECTED TOWARDS THE HIGHEST NEED AREAS THAT ARE BOTH. THE MOST LIKELY TO EXPERIENCEWE'D HAVE ALL THE DATA THE BILL. A SERIES WILDFIRE AND THAT WILL BE MOST IMPACTED BY POWER SHUT OFFS. SO THAT. IS WHY I WOULD APPROVED THE ALLOCATION BUT WITH PLACE HOLDER TRAILER LANGUAGE SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY BEST WAY TO ALLOCATE THAT FIFTEEN MILLION. WE'RE NOT VOTING YET. END UP POLICIES FOR ALL THE COMMENTARY BUT- BY WAS IN OFFICE DURING THAT FIGHT FIRE AND- I WAS ALSO ON THE BOARD LATER ON THE BOARD OF THESE BE REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT WHEN. UP CONFIRA KURT. I'M OKAY SO WE OTHERWISE ALL THE OTHER ITEMS EXCEPT THE ONE THAT- CENTER MORE LIKE CALDERON VOTE ONLY SO I BELIEVE- STAFF TO FIND WHAT I SEE THE LA- HAS THEIR HANDS UP LET'S HEAR FROM WELL FIRST DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THEN LA- YES THEN THEY WILL GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT. THIRTY ONE YOUR COMMENTS I THINK GREATER WHY THIS NEXT ROUND OF FUNDING IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET WE ARE FOCUSING ON A LOCAL ASSISTANCE IN TRYING TO ALSO OUTLINES DOING IT KIND OF A IMMEDIATE A MATCHING GRANT PROGRAM EXCEPT THAT'S AVAILABLE TO TRY AND GET FUNDING ALLOWS SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND OTHERS TO BE ELIGIBLE. THIS YEAR'S ROUND FUNDING. SO I POINTED OUT TO GET AND IT GOES TO SOME OF OUR THINKING BEING SOMEONE LINE BEFORE YOUR COMMENT THANK YOU IT'S NOT- IT WASN'T CLEAR THAT SPECIAL DISTRICTS MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE AND THE DIFFICULTY OF JUST DOING IT BY COUNTY IS THAT SOME SPECIAL DISTRICTS ARE COVER MULTIPLE COUNTY SO JUST THESE THE KINDS OF THINGS WILL DISCUSS AS WE LAND. THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FILIALES. DEAR ME THIS IS TIME YES GO AHEAD. THANK YOU GOOD EVENING AT YEAR END SENATORS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LETTING ME SPEAK- BRIEFLY SO WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER REDUCING THE FUNDING LEVEL FOR THIS PROPOSAL JUST GIVEN THE CONDITION OF THE GENERAL FUND AND THE LACK OF CLARITY ABOUT THE AMOUNT NEEDED FOR THIS PURPOSE. AS WAS NOTED THERE WAS FUNDING LAST YEAR THAT WAS PERMITTED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION- IF APPROVED TO RECOMMEND TO ACTIONS FIRST ADOPTING LANGUAGE THAT FURTHER DEFINES HOW FUNDS TO BE USED SUCH AS THE AMOUNT FOR LOCAL ASSISTANCE VERSUS THE OBLIGATION SO AND WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THIS BECAUSE CURRENTLY THE LANGUAGE IS VERY BROAD. BASICALLY CAN BE USED FOR ANY COMMUNITY RESILIENCY ACTIVITIES BY STATE OR OR LOCAL ENTITIES AND SO IT'S NOT CLEAR EVEN IF THE LEGISLATURE OR EVEN IF THE ADMINISTRATION'S INTENSITY THAT MOSTLY FOR LOCALS THAT IT'S NOT CLEARLY DEFINED IN THE LANGUAGE. ON THIS SURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE. I CAN'T. REQUIRE YES REPORT ON HOW THE FUNDS OLD. USE AND I'M WHAT OUT ARE ACHIEVED. WE KNOW THAT THIS TYPE OF REPORTING WAS INCLUDED IN THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET- BUT IT'S NOT ACTUALLY PROPOSE FOR INCLUSION IN THE BUDGET YEAR- LANGUAGE. AND WE THINK THIS WILL GIVE THE LEGISLATURE'S ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AFTER THE FACT AND HOW THE- MONEY WAS USED AND HELP ENSURE THAT. WE CAN REALLY ESTáN. IN THIS AFTER THE FACT. THANK YOU. LET'S SEE OKAY SO THAT WAS ALIEN DELAP WE HEARD FROM THEM GREAT ALRIGHT SO. NOW I BELIEVE WHAT I WOULD DO NEXT. IS HERE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT IS THAT CORRECT. OKAY SO- HAVING HEARD FROM THE DEPARTMENTS AND DISCUSS THE ONLY ITEMS WE'RE DISCUSSING EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE MANY MANY ITEMS HERE. AND I MEAN WE ALSO IN IN THIS AGENDA WAS- FOR EXAMPLE. OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND ADDITIONALLY VICTIM COMPENSATION FUND SO CERTAINLY WE MAY HAVE SOME PUBLIC COMMENT ON THAT I TO WANT TO PREDICT BUT WHAT I WILL DO FIRST SO PEOPLE WHO ARE CALLING IN- WE WILL GET YOU VERY SOON SO- THE PHONE NUMBER IS ON THE. COMMITTEE THE SUB FIVE WEBSITE I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WANT TO SCREW IT TEARS CURLED ON THE SCREEN NOW- BUT FIRST WE WILL LOOK TO THIS ROOM AND SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE HERE. WHO WANTS TO- SPEAK ON ANY OF THESE ITEMS AND I WOULD SAY NO BECAUSE IT IS OUR SAME STAFF WERE IN THE pROOM. AND I WILL THEN ASKED TO LEAVE THE ROOM ON THE SECOND FLOOR MY GUESS IS THERE'S NO ONE THERE EITHER OKAY THERE ISN'T. SO THAT MEANS THAT WE GO TO THE PHONE LINES. I'M SORRY GO AND- BILL GO AHEAD. WELL IF YOU COULD LOOK AT PAGE SIX AND THEN YOU LOOK AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE SIX. AND I'M REFERRING TO ITEM NINETEEN OVER. IT IT SAYS GENERAL FUND MINUS FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THERE HAS ALL THESE ITEMS. EACH ONE OF THEM IS DIFFERENT AMOUNT THE TOTAL MORE THAN FIVE MILLION OBVIOUSLY- SO COULD SOMEBODY EXPLAIN I DO- DIED IN A STAND ON IT WAS ON VOTE ONLY BUT WILL PULL IT THAT'S OKAY WE'LL JUST- NOT NOT IT'S NOT IT'S JIM IF YOU ASK THE QUESTION I CAN'T. UNDERSTAND IT RIGHT RIGHT SO ISSUE NUMBER NINETEEN THAT IS CURRENTLY ON THE VOTE ONLY WE ARE PULLING AS WE DID FOR THE ISSUE FOR CENTER MORE LIKE SO THAT THE QUESTION THAT SENATOR BILL RAISED. ON WHICH IS A LEGITIMATE QUESTION CAN BE EXPLAINED. BY LET'S SEE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE GO AHEAD. SURE ENOUGH HERE- WHAT THE DISTINCTION AS A SENATOR IS. THE FUNDING WITH THE- FORTY ONE MILLION IS CURRENT YEAR FUNDING WHERE IS THE FIVE MILLION PROPOSED IS BUDGET YOUR FUNDING. THE REVERSION GOALS WAS TO. RIVER TO ENCUMBER BALANCE OF THE CURRENT YEAR DOLLARS- AND THEN SHORT ONE PARTICULAR GOALS ALL ITS TO MURDER FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN BUDGET YEAR AND ANOTHER FIVE MILLION DOLLARS BUT YEAR PLUS ONE THEONE THAT IS A PROPOSAL WHICH ONE WHICH PROPOSAL. IT IS THE INTERNET CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN PROPOSAL THAT WAS- ALLEGE INVESTMENT FROM LAST YEAR. WHERE IT IS REMOVING THAT INVESTMENT. IS THAT CORRECT. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IT IS TO- RIVER AT THE END OF COMBAT ROUNDS OF THE CURRENT YEAR DOLLARS AND ALSO TO WITHDRAWAL THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS PROVIDED AND TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND ALSO TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IT WAS A- PROPOSAL THAT PROVIDED FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OVER A THREE YEAR. HELLO COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT. IN TERMS OF THAT INTERNET FOR IS THAT MEAN THAT IMPLEMENTED IS THIS ACTION BASICALLY- PREVENT THAT LEGISLATION FROM BEING IMPLEMENTED. CRITICS YOUR YOUR ACTION WOULD- REJECT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL- AND- DEFERRED TO FUTURE DELIBERATIONS OKAY YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT I WAS JUST READING IT WRONG. THE ADMINISTRATION'S RECOMMENDATION WOULD ENSURE THAT THE AND AGAIN I'M NOT TRYING TO. ADD A VALUE STATEMENT JUST THAT THE- LEGISLATION WAS IMPLEMENTED IN OUR REJECTION OF IT WOULD ALLOW FOR SOME MORE DISCUSSION TO A POTENTIALLY HAVE SOME ASPECT OF THAT PROGRAM STILL IMPLEMENTED. I CHARACTERIZE THAT CORRECTLY OKAY IS THAT HELP- CENTER ABOUT ALL THE ALL THE OTHER YOUR BALANCES. OR GO TO BE SWEPT. NOT NOT EXPANDED SO WE HAVE SEVERAL PROGRAMS HERE THAT WE VOTED ON LAST YEAR. THE IN THE BUDGET AND THEN THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE. APPROVED OF OR ARE THERE GOING TO BE FROZEN AND THE MONEY IS GONNA BE TAKEN BACK CORRECT IS THAT THE KIND OF THE. IF SHE STAFF RECOMMENDATION- WORK TO HOLD IN THE- THE- SUBCOMMITTEE REJECTED THE PROPOSAL BY THE ADMINISTRATION- THEN THE UNDER COVERED BALANCES OF. OKAY THOSE LEGEND BEST FRIENDS WOULD NOT RIVER AS OF JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY NINETEEN- FOR REJECTION DOES AB BASICALLY WOULD NOT REVERT ANYTHING. IT IS HARD THE DIFFICULTY WITH A LOT OF MONEY YET THE DIFFICULTY WITH THE CHART AND I APPRECIATE THAT. IS THAT THIS CHART IS SHOWING MAY REVISE BECAUSE THE MAY REVISED ASSUMES THAT THE ORIGINAL THE JANUARY BUDGET IS. JUST LIKE I DON'T MEAN IT TO I DO WANT TO SAY ADOPTED BIRD LIKE WE'RE JUST OPERATING FROM THE G. THREE BUDGET. AND SINCE WE DIDN'T EVEN GET TO HAVE OUR HEARINGS ON THE CHECK PERFECT COACH THAT THE CHARTER CONFUSING FOR US SO IN EFFECT. WELL IT SHOWS IT THAT. WERE REALLY REJECTING THE REVERSION OF ANY OF THESE LEGISLATIVE ITEMS BY. OUR BY THE RECOMMENDATION HERE. THAT OKAY. HI I HOPE THAT MADE SOME SENSE. OKAY YOU KNOW I'M REALLY GLAD YOU DID ASK BECAUSE I'M LIKE I GOT BRIEFED AND I THINK I PRY UNDER SNOW LIKE A BRIEF BUT I COULDN'T RECALL IT RIGHT NOW. YOU CAN TRUST AND WHO. ALRIGHT SO WITH THAT WE WILL- GO TO THE PUBLIC COMMENT AND WE HAVE THE PHONE LINES AND ALL EXPLAINED VOTING AFTER THAT. RIGHT PHONE LINES.
