AND MY STAFF WILL BE THERE TO TRY TO HELP THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. TODAY WE'LL DISCUSS THE PREVALENCE OF MICROPLASTICS IN OUR ENVIRONMENT. PLASTIC POLLUTION IS A PERSISTENT AND GROWING SOURCE OF POLLUTION NOT ONLY STATEWIDE BUT WORLDWIDE- IT AFFECTS OUR NATURAL RESOURCES SUCH AS THE QUALITY OF OUR DRINKING WATER AND PUBLIC HEALTH. WELL PLASTICS HAVE UNDOUBTEDLY MADE OUR LIVES SAFER AND MORE CONVENIENT. FOR MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES TWO CAR SEATS TO THE TAKE OUT TO PACKAGING RESTAURANTS. ARE USING- DURING THE PANDEMIC- THEY ALSO BECOME A PRESSURE POINT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION AND WASTE GENERATION. THE UBIQUITY OF PLASTICS IN DAILY LIFE HAS LED TO A GROWING SURGE OF PLASTIC WASTE. THIS INCLUDES SINGLE USE PLASTICS LIKE COFFEE CUPS AND LIDS. PLASTIC BAGS CIGARETTE **** BALLOONS STRAWS PLASTIC BOTTLES PLASTIC PACKAGING AND EVEN SYNTHETIC TEXTILES. WELL WHEN PLASTIC WASTE IS LITTERED STORMWATER CAN CARRY IT OUT TO OUR RIVERS BAYS AND COASTLINES. LAST EXIT GET WASHED DOWN THE DRAIN. FROM THE GREYWATER OF RESIDENTIAL WASHING MACHINES AND SINKS GOES TO WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANT. AND WE HEAR FROM THE- FOLKS TO. RUN THE WASTE WATER TREATMENT THAT THEY CAN FILTER ALL THAT PLASTIC OUT OF THE VAST MAJORITY BUT THEN IT ENDS UP IN THE SLUDGE AND THE SLUDGE GOES OUT EVER CULTURAL LANCE SO WE ARE. ALMOST CERTAINLY WHEN WE USE THE SLIDE. IN AGRICULTURAL LANDS WERE POLLUTED WITH PLASTIC MICROPLASTICS. HOSOE PLASTIC WASTE WHEN IT GETS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT NEVER FULLY. I HAD A GREAT PLASTIC BREAKS DOWN INTO SMALLER AND SMALLER FRAGMENTS. UNTIL THEY ARE WHAT WE CALL MICROPLASTICS MICROPLASTICS ARE FOUND VIRTUALLY EVERYWHERE EVEN IN THE UMAN BODY. SO WE ALL HAVE. WE KNOW SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF PLASTICS GO INTO OUR OCEANS CENTER COMING FROM DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. TODAY WE'RE JUST GOING TO FOCUS ON CALIFORNIA'S CONTRIBUTION TO THIS GROWING POLLUTION SOURCE AND WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT HERE- THE U. N. IS IN THE WORLD BANK OR LOOKING INTO WHAT THEY CAN DO. AND IN THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IS LARGELY A MATTER OF. THEY HAVE NO TRASH COLLECTION. THE PURPOSE OF OUR HEARING TODAY IS TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT MICROPLASTICS ARE. WHERE THEY COME FROM HOW THEY'RE AFFECTING OUR ENVIRONMENT WATER QUALITY AND PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEAR ABOUT THE DIFFERENT PIECES TO THE PUZZLE WE NEED TO ASSEMBLE TO MANAGE THIS POLLUTION SOURCE. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE WITNESSES THAT WE WILL HAVE WITH US TODAY. THEY'RE ALL TESTIFIED REMOTELY. AND AS A RESULT THEY'RE HERE FROM AROUND THE WORLD- INCLUDING LONDON. PLEASE NOTE THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SHARE THEIR VIEWS AGAIN AS WE SAID BEFORE AT THE END OF THE HEARING WHEN EVERYONE WILL HAVE TWO MINUTES. TO MAKE A STATEMENT. BEFORE I GET TO THE FIRST PANEL. I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER REBEKAH BAUR CHANGED HANDS THIS YEAR IN PERSON. AND I WOULD LIKE- FIRST VICE CHAIR IF YOU HAVE A COMMENT OR TWO OF. CITY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AS A FRESHMAN LEGISLATORS NEWLY ELECTED I'M HONORED TO BE THE VICE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND ALL OF US IN THEIR STAFFS SO WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT OUR ENVIRONMENT STAYS CLEAN AND FRESH FOR THE FUTURE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE PRESENTATION TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF DOLLY. THANK YOU I'M ALSO HONORED TO BE JOINING THIS COMMITTEE IT'S VERY RELEVANT FOR MY DISTRICT A FARMER MYSELF AND- LOOKING FOR TODAY'S PRESENTATION THANK YOU THANK YOU AND- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARC BECKER REBEKAH BAUR. THE YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN TO THANK YOU IN THE COMMITTEE STAFFER CAN THIS HEARING TODAY IT'S- DISCUSSION I REALLY WE'VE BEEN TAUGHT ABOUT SINCE I JOIN THE LEGISLATURE SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND I KNOW AN AREA THAT YOU ARE VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT BUT IT'S CRITICAL TO THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF BOTH. OUR ENVIRONMENT OUR OFF SHORE- ANIMALS AND THE INDIVIDUALS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT THEN CONSUME SOME OF THE ANIMALS THAT LIVE OFFSHORE SO WE NEED TO GET A HANDLE ON WHY. THE RATES OF MICROPLASTICS HERE IN CALIFORNIA A LOT ON THE WEST COAST OR SO HIGH AND DO WHAT WE CAN TO REDUCE THE PREVALENCE OF IT SENSE I KNOW OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS FRANCE ALREADY TAKEN STEPS IN THAT DIRECTION AND I BELIEVE WE WILL BE NEXT. TO LEAD THE UNITED STATES I THINK YOU. ALL ON ONE TO ASK MY STE. IS THERE WAY. THAT ANY THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARTS. THE TO SAN WHO ARE REALLY IS THERE ANY WAY CAN- MAKE. STATE. RELATED READ ONLINE. YEAH OKAY YEAH. YES SHARON THIS IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALBERT'S WHICH YOU CAN HEAR ME. YES OKAY. WONDERFUL I JUST WANTED TO SEND MY GREETINGS FROM BEAUTIFUL TORRANCE CALIFORNIA AND GLAD TO BE HERE THANK YOU. GOOD TO HAVE YOU. ANYONE ELSE. OKAY I WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THIS IS HENRY STERN I DON'T KNOW IF I'M ALLOWED TO AMUSE MYSELF I DON'T I DON'T KNOW VIOLATED SIMPLY PROTOCOL RIGHT OUT THE GATES. BUT I APPRECIATE YOU COVERING THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TOPIC IS- SENATE WATER CHAIR- WERE VERY KEENLY INTERESTED IN THIS IS YOUR MICROPLASTICS BOTH AS IT APPLIES TO CONSUMER AND PUBLIC HEALTH BUT ALSO TO AGRICULTURAL HEALTH WE'RE SHARING. OUR NEW DATA OUT EVERY DAY AND YOU STUDY JUST ON IMPACTS ON AGRICULTURAL SOILS FROM SYNTHETICS AND IT'S- A TO MYRIAD AND CONFOUNDING ISSUE THAT I JUST APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP ON MISTER CHAIR. WE OBVIOUSLY OF A PANDEMIC TO FIGHT IN A LOT OF OTHER THINGS GOING ON BUT THESE GENDER QUIET LURKING ISSUES IN THE BACKGROUND CAN CAN REALLY JUMP UP TO BITE US IF WE DON'T STAY AHEAD OF THEM AND SO THANK YOU FOR STEPPING UP IN AND TAKEN THE MANTLE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SENATOR. WE HAVE ANYONE ELSE. WELL THANK YOU FOR- BEING HERE. ALL RIGHT AND FOR ALL OF THOSE WHO ARE LOOKING AT REMOTELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TAKING PART IN THIS. ON TO START THE HEARING OFF I'D LIKE TO INVITE DOCTOR SCOTT COFFIN. WITH THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD TELL US ABOUT THE STATE WATER BOARDS WORK TO IMPLEMENT S. B. FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO. AND THE RESEARCH TO FIND MICROPLASTICS IN THE CONTEXT OF DRINKING WATER. I'D LIKE TO ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO HOLD THEIR QUESTIONS UNTIL THE END OF THE PANEL WHEN WE CAN DIRECT QUESTIONS TO ALL THREE SPEAKERS- ONE EXCEPTION WOULD BE IF YOU REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND SOME TECHNOLOGY TERMINOLOGY THAT'S BEING USED- AND TO GET MY ATTENTION AND WILL TRY AND ASK ABOUT THAT I KNOW THAT CAN BE. I AND I'LL ASK THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SPEAKING- TO- AVOID THE WORK OF AKRON DEVOID ACRONYMS AND- AND JARGON AND TRY AND MAKE THIS- UNDERSTANDABLE TO ALL. SO DR PROFIT- PLEASE START YOU HAVE UP TO FIFTEEN MINUTES- FOR YOUR PROTECT FOR YOUR ROUND PRESENTATION. TWENTY CHAIR- DOCTOR QUIRK AND IT'S A PLEASURE TO SPEAK TO YOU ALL TODAY GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC. MY NAME IS DR SCOTT KAUFMAN AND I'M A RESEARCH SCIENTIST WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE STATE WATER BOARDS IMPLEMENTATION OF SENATE BILL FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO. WHICH DEALS WITH MICROPLASTICS IN DRINKING WATER AS WELL FROM OTHER RELEVANT COMPONENTS THAT CONNECT TO THIS ISSUE. BY THE END OF THE STOCK YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THAT PLASTIC DOES NOT JUST GO AWAY. AND THAT THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING THROUGH. THIS BILLS IMPLEMENTATION WILL ALLOW FOR MORE CONCRETE ACTION AND SOLUTIONS. PLASTIC I'M NOT SURE MY SLIDES EXCUSE ME WELL. THERE WE GO. THE PLASTIC WASTE CRISIS HAS RECENTLY GAINED ATTENTION IN THE MEDIA EVERYWHERE WE LOOK WE SEEM TO FIND THE SYNTHETIC PARTICLES FROM THE DEEPEST PART OF THE OCEAN TO THE TALLEST MOUNTAIN. IF WE CONTINUE WITH BUSINESS AS USUAL. WE WILL DOUBLE THE RATE AT WHICH PLASTIC ENTERS THE ENVIRONMENT BY THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY. I SHOWN IN THIS TEAL LINE ON THIS GRAPH. PLASTIC DEGRADES IN THE ENVIRONMENT INTO SMALLER PARTICLES CALLED MICROPLASTICS. PLASTIC PARTICLES MAY CONTAMINATE WATER THROUGH MULTIPLE ROUTES INCLUDING FOR STORM WATER WASTEWATER AND ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION JUST TO NAME A FEW. ONCE IN WATER MICROPLASTICS MAY SINK AND BECOME SETTLEMENT AS WELL AS GET RESUSPENDED INTO THE WATER COLUMN WHERE THEY BE TAKEN UP INTO WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS AND DRINKING WATER TREATMENT PLANTS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS ARE GENERALLY HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT REMOVING MICROPLASTICS WITH REMOVAL RATES BETWEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AND 99% INTO SLUDGE AS SHOWN IN THIS DIAGRAM. REMOVAL RATES VARY BY TREATMENT PROCESS SEES AS SHOWN HERE WITH THAT ADD MORE ADVANCED TREATMENT PROCESSES ARE MOVING MORE. AND WHEN LOOKING AT THIS FIGURE YOU MAY BE WONDERING WHERE THE SLUDGE CODES AND AS AS MENTIONED EARLIER BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER DR CORK- SOME OF IT ACTUALLY GOES TO AGRICULTURE. I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT NOW SO AFTER PROCESSING A PORTION OF THE SEWAGE SLUDGE IS GOOD IS OFTEN CONVERTED INTO BIOSOLIDS WHICH ARE NUTRIENT RICH ORGANIC SOLIDS THAT ARE OFTEN APPLIED TO LAND FOR GROWING CROPS COMPOSTING OR FOR DEEP WELL INJECTION TROUPE PRODUCED RENEWABLE ENERGY. DUE TO THEIR POINT NATURE AND PERSISTENCE IN THE ENVIRONMENT MICROPLASTICS CUMULATE AND TOP SOILS AND ARE FOUND IN HIGH QUANTITIES AND FIELDS WITH APPLIED BIOSOLIDS. ONE RECENT STUDY ESTIMATED THAT BETWEEN FORTY FOUR THOUSAND AND THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND TONS OF MICROPLASTICS INTO AGRICULTURAL EVERY YEAR IN NORTH AMERICA ALONE. I SHOWN HERE THE OTHERS THE MICROPLASTICS IN COMPOST WHICH MAY ALSO BE A RELEVANT SOURCE FOR AGRICULTURAL FIELDS. NOW WHAT HAPPENS CHIU PLANS WHEN THEY'RE EXPOSED TO MICROPLASTICS AND SOIL. WE KNOW THAT PLANTS MAKE UP TAKE AND ACCUMULATE SMALL MICROPLASTICS THROUGH THEIR ROOTS AS VISUALIZED BY THESE GREEN FLUORESCENT LABELED MICROPLASTICS. EXPOSURE TO MICROPLASTICS BECAUSE REDUCED PLANT GROWTH. DUE TO ROOF DAMAGE AS SHOWN IN THIS RECENT STUDY IN TWENTY TWENTY. AT HIGH ENOUGH CONCENTRATIONS MICROPLASTICS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO DECREASE THE NUMBER OF MATURE TOMATOES HOWEVER MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE WHAT IMPACTS TO AGRICULTURE EXIST- AND BASED ON THIS LIMITED EVIDENCE IT'S CLEAR THAT WE CANNOT DEPEND ENTIRELY ON WASTEWATER TREATMENT TO SOLVE THE ISSUE OF MICROPLASTICS POLLUTION. AS DOING SO MAY CREATE ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS WITH ACCUMULATION AND AGRICULTURAL FIELDS WHICH MAY THREATEN FOOD SECURITY. SO DUE TO THE WIDESPREAD CONTAINMENT OF MIKE CAN DUE TO THE WIDESPREAD CONTAMINATION OF MICROPLASTICS IT IS UNSURPRISING YET STARTLING. AT THE FIRST STUDY TO MONITOR FOR MICROPLASTICS IN TAP WATER BOND SUCH PARTICLES IN 83% OF SAMPLES WORLDWIDE AND 94% OF SAMPLES IN THE UNITED STATES. THESE FINDINGS CAUSED CONCERN FOR POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO HUMAN HEALTH. AND PROMPTED THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE TO PASS SENATE BILL FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO TWENTY EIGHTEEN. WHICH REQUIRES THE STATE WATER BOARD TO FIRST DEFINE MICROPLASTICS BY JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY. IN ADOPTED STANDARD ANALYTICAL METHOD PROVIDE ACCREDITATION FOR LABORATORIES CONSIDER ADOPTING HEALTH BASED GUIDANCE LEVEL. AND A DOCTOR PLAN TO REFORM FOR YEARS OF TESTING AND ANALYSIS BY JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. MICHAEL IS NO TRIVIAL TASK AS THIS CONTAMINANTS. IS INCREDIBLY DIVERSE IN THE NUMBER OF PARTICLE SHAPES SIZES COLORS AND ASSOCIATED CONTAMINANTS THAT OCCUR WITHIN THIS MISS UNIVERSE OF MICROPLASTICS. DESPITE THESE DIFFICULTIES THE STATE WATER BOARD ADOPTED THE WORLD'S FIRST REGULATORY DEFINITION OF MICROPLASTICS ON JUNE SIXTH TWENTY TWENTY. THIS DEFINITION IS BROAD AND INCLUDES PARTICLES BETWEEN ONE NANOMETER AND FIVE THOUSAND MICROMETERS WITH AN ADDITIONAL SIZE BASED CLASSIFICATION SCHEME SHOWN HERE. THE POLYMER IS INCLUDED IN THIS REGULATORY DEFINITION INCLUDE PLASTICS WITH NUMBERS ONE THROUGH SEVEN ON THE BOTTOM SHOWN HERE. AS WELL AS SYNTHETIC POLYMERS THAT MAY NOT BE TYPICALLY REFERRED TO AS PLASTIC INCLUDING SYNTHETIC RUBBER FIBERS SILICONES BIOBASED AND BIODEGRADABLE POLYMERS AS WELL AS CELLULOSE ACETATE WHICH IS COMMONLY FOUND IN CIGARETTE FILTERS. WHILE THE STATE WATER BOARDS DEFINITION OF MICROPLASTICS IS THE FIRST REGULATORY DEFINITION FOR THE PURPOSES OF DRINKING WATER HE WAS INFORMED BY ATTRACT DEFINITION IN EUROPE. IN CHEMICAL AGENCIES DEFINITION WHICH IS DESIGNED FOR PROPOSED RESTRICTION ON INTENTIONALLY ADDED MICROPLASTICS TO CONSUMER PRODUCTS. PROVIDES AN EXCLUSION FOR BIODEGRADABLE PLASTICS THE STATE WATER BOARDS DEFINITION INCLUDES BIODEGRADABLE PLASTICS BASED ON A LACK OF EVIDENCE FOR HUMAN SAFETY. RATIONALE FOR INCLUDING BIODEGRADABLE POLYMERS INCLUDED IT UNDERSTANDING THAT MICROPLASTICS CAN TRANSFER HARMFUL CHEMICALS DURING EXPOSURE. SOME OF THESE CHEMICALS THAT DISRUPT THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM AND CAUSE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF VERY LOW CONCENTRATIONS. I EXAMPLE YOU MIGHT BE FAMILIAR WITH IT IS BUSY YOU KNOW HEY WHICH MIMICS THE NATURAL HORMONE ESTROGEN CAUSING IMBALANCES IN THE BODY WE CAN SEE HEAR AND READ THE PART OF THE CHEMICAL THAT LOOKS QUITE SIMILAR TO THE NATURAL HORMONE ESTROGEN AND YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A COUPLE OTHER PLASTIC ADDITIVES THAT RESEMBLE ESTROGEN IN COSTS SIMILAR FACTS. ANOTHER IN THE CONSTRUCTOR IS UP PVD WHICH IS A FLAME RETARDANT. AT IT'S COMMONLY FOUND AND IN PLASTIC. AND BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND ONE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN PVD EXPOSURE CAUSED MORE INTELLECTUAL THIS DISABILITIES. IN PESTICIDES MERCURY AND LEAD COMBINED IN THE UNITED STATES. THESE HELP BURDENS LEAD TO MORE THAN THREE TRILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC DAMAGES. AB DE AND OTHER FLAME RETARDANTS ARE FOUND IN MANY OF THE PLASTIC ITEMS IN OUR HOMES INCLUDING INSULATION UPHOLSTERED FURNITURE CARPET AND EVEN SOME BABY PRODUCTS SO WHEN WE'RE EXPOSED TO MICROPLASTICS THAT HAVE BEEN TREATED WITH DVD AND OTHER ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS THIS MAY BE A RELEVANT ROUTE OF EXPOSURE FROM THESE. HARMFUL CHEMICALS. THE PRESENCE OF HARMFUL CHEMICALS LIKE PVD IS AND OTHER COULD INTEGRATE DISRUPTORS IN BIOPLASTICS HAVE NOT BEEN THOROUGHLY TESTED. IN GENERAL BIOPLASTICS ARE NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT HAVE NOT UNDERGONE RIGOROUS HEALTH TESTING. A RECENT STUDY CHARACTERIZED TOXIC CHEMICALS THAT LEACH FROM BIOPLASTICS USING A VARIETY OF TECHNIQUES INCLUDING ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY AND BIOLOGY. THIS STUDY FOUND THAT CONVENTIONAL PETROLEUM BASED PLASTIC PRODUCTS ASSURANT LAST RELEASED A SIMILAR QUANTITIES OF ENDOCRINE DISRUPTING CHEMICALS AS BIOPLASTICS STARTED THE RIGHT. THIS REACHES THIS RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT WE CANNOT CONSIDER MICROPLASTICS GENERATED FROM BIOPLASTICS OR CONVENTIONAL PLASTICS TO BE SAFE FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. BIG DUE TO A LACK OF RIGOROUS TESTING AND THE WIDESPREAD OCCURRENCE OF THESE HARMFUL ADDITIVES. NOW THAT WE'VE DEFINED MICROPLASTICS WE DON'T HAVE A COMMON STARTING POINT FOR DEVELOPING METHODS AND UNDERSTANDING HUMAN HEALTH IMPACTS. SENATE BILL FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO REQUIRES THE STATE WATER BOARD TO ADOPT A STANDARD ANALYTICAL METHOD FOR MONITORING MICROPLASTICS IN DRINKING WATER BY JULY FIRST. CURRENTLY THERE ARE NO STANDARD METHODS AVAILABLE. STANDARD METHODS OF MONITORING ARM PORTENT BECAUSE WHEN WE CAN MONITOR THE ISSUE WE CAN MANAGE THE ISSUE. TO FILL THIS GAP WE'RE WORKING WITH FORTY ORGANIZATIONS FROM AROUND THE WORLD TO DEVELOP AND STANDARDIZE METHODOLOGY TO MONITOR MICROPLASTICS IN DRINKING WATER. AS WELL AS OCEAN WATER FISH TISSUE AND SEDIMENT USING A VARIETY OF ANALYTICAL INSTRUMENTS. PARTICIPATING ORGANIZATIONS ARE FROM MULTIPLE SECTORS INCLUDING ACADEMIA GOVERNMENT INDUSTRY AND NON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS WITH JUST A FEW OF THOSE REPRESENTED HERE. AFTER STANDARDIZING METHODS THE STATE WATER BOARD WILL PROVIDE ACCREDITATION FOR LABORATORIES ACCREDITATION WILL BE CARRIED OUT BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL LABORATORY ACCREDITATION PROGRAM WHICH IS PART OF THE STATE WATER BOARD. ACCREDITATION IS VITAL TO ENSURING THAT RESULTS BETWEEN LABORATORIES ARE COMPATIBLE. SENATE BILL FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE STATE WATER BOARD CONSIDER ADOPTING A HEALTH BASED GUIDANCELEVEL EAT CONSUMERS INTERPRETING THEIR CONCENTRATIONS IN DRINKING WATER. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THE HUMAN HEALTH IMPACTS FROM INGESTION OF MICROPLASTICS ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD YET. WE'RE ADDRESSING THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP BY WORKING WITH A NUMBER OF RESEARCH PARTNERS AND EXPERTS TO EVALUATE TOXICITY DATA AND DEVELOP THRESHOLDS FOR DRINKING WATER AND AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS AS WELL. BUT IT STARTED IN OCTOBER AND WILL BE FINISHED BY PEOPLE OF THIS YEAR. SINCE TWENTY TWELVE THERE'S BEEN A SHARP RISE IN THE NUMBER OF TOXICITY STUDIES OR MICROPLASTICS FOR BOTH THE ENVIRONMENT AND HUMAN HEALTH. IN TWENTY TWENTY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HUMAN RELATED TOXICITIES DOUBLES DOUBLED. IN ONE YEAR. THIS RECENT EVIDENCE ALLOWS US TO ACTUALLY CONSIDER IMPACTS TO HUMANS. WHILE MANY QUESTIONS REMAIN EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT SMALLER MICROPLASTIC PARTICLES ARE MORE TOXIC TO HUMANS. A RECENT STUDY FOUND THAT FOUR OUT OF SIX HUMAN PLACENTAS CONTAINED MICROPLASTICS PROVIDING EVIDENCE THAT THESE PARTICLES ACCUMULATE IN THE HUMAN BODY AND ARE NOT JUST RAPIDLY EXCRETED. NOTABLY ONLY PARTICLES SMALLER THAN TEN MICROMETERS WERE FOUND IN THE SAMPLES. EVIDENCE FOR THE HUMAN HEALTH IMPACTS OF SMALLER PARTICLES WILL BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN DEVELOPING OUR PLAN FOR FOUR YEARS OF TESTING AND ANALYSIS AND DRINKING WATER AS REQUIRED BY SENATE BILL. FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO. MICROPLASTIC PARTICLES SMALLER THAN TEN MICROMETERS ARE NOT ONLY BELIEVED TO BE MORE TOXIC TO HUMANS BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEY'RE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR IN DRINKING WATER. RECENT STUDIES MONITORING MICROPLASTICS A DIFFERENT TREATMENT STAGES AND- DRINKING WATER TREATMENT PLANT. FOUNDED THAT. HAS TREATMENT INCREASES CONCENTRATIONS CONCENTRATIONS OF MICROPLASTICS. MICROPLASTICS DECREASE STARTING FROM RAW WATER ON THE LEFT IS SHOWN IN THIS FIGURE TO FINISH DRINKING WATER ON THE RIGHT. WELL TREATMENT REMOVES THE MAJORITY OF MICROPLASTICS. THESE THESE PARTICLES SMALLER THAN TEN MICRONS TEND TO REMAIN AND- I GUESS THESE PARTICLES ARE ACTUALLY THE MOST DIFFICULT TO MONITOR ANALYTICALLY SO ANOTHER CHALLENGE. MICROPLASTICS ARE FOUND IN DRINKING WATER AT RELATIVE PROPORTIONS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF PLASTICS AND COMMERCE SUGGESTING THAT THE ORIGIN OF THESE PARTICLES ARE LIKELY SINGLE USE PRODUCTS AND TEXTILES. SO IN CONCLUSION BOSTICK BREAKS DOWN INTO SMALLER PARTICLES ENVIRONMENT AND CAN CONTAMINATE WATER AND LAND THESE PARTICLES ARE EVERYWHERE AND THEY DO NOT JUST GO AWAY. THE STATE WATER BOARDS REGULATORY DEFINITION STANDARDIZED METHODS AND% LABORATORY ACCREDITATION PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED CONSISTENCY FOR THE FIELD. WHAT ONE THIRTIES REMAIN IN REGARD TO HUMAN HEALTH IMPACTS THE EVIDENCE IS INCREASING RAPIDLY AND WE WILL LEARN MORE IMPACTS- IT A VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. SO THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME AGAIN TO SPEAK TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWER ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE- THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD THIS BRIEFING AS WELL AND IT IS SCARIER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE- SENATOR BEN ALLEN HAS JOINED US. SENATOR DO YOU WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT AND THEN PERHAPS IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS- WILL DO WILL DEAL WITH THEM AT THE END OF THE PANELS- DO I MAKE A COMMENT. VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE OBVIOUSLY THIS IS AN THEIR ISSUE IT'S VERY CLOSE TO MY- INTERESTED IN- FOR ALL THE REASONS JUST ARTICULATED AND SHOCKING DATA FOR UP 26% OF. YEAH SO HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET SOME SERIOUS WORKED ON THIS OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THEN OUR NEXT PANELIST- WE'RE GOING TO GO. DR REBECCA SUTTON SUTTON WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO ESTUARY INSTITUTE TO DISCUSS FINDINGS FROM THEIR STUDY UNDERSTANDING MICROPLASTIC LEVELS PATHWAYS AND TRANSPORT INTO THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY REGION THIS IS TRULY HEROIC WORK. UP UNTIL NOW- PEOPLE ARE SORT OF ASSUMED THAT PLASTIC STANDARD MEANT ENTERED THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WHERE THEY ACTUALLY MEASURE WHAT PLASTICS GETTING IN- FROM WHICH WE CAN GUESS WHAT THE SOURCES ARE. AND YOU KNOW IT'S REAL DATA IT'S NOT SOMEBODY'S GAS. IT'S REAL DATA AND WHILE THIS WAS DONE SPECIFICALLY FOR THE BAY IN THE ESTUARY- I BELIEVE THAT. WE CAN LEARN MUCH ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO OUR RIVERS THE SACRAMENTO AND SAN JOAQUIN RIVER UP FROM WHAT ENTRIES HERE BECAUSE THE SOURCES ARE GOING TO BE SIMILAR- THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SO WITH THAT OF DR SUTTON THANK YOU FOR THIS YEAR EXCELLENT WORK AND PLEASE THE PROJECT AND YOU HAVE UP TO FIFTEEN MINUTES THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT AND VERY GENEROUS INTRODUCTION WE ARE VERY PROUD OF THIS THREE YEAR EFFORT THAT I'LL BE SHARING WITH YOU I'M WITH SAM SISCO ASSURANCE TO. AND WE ARE AN INDEPENDENT AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM SCIENCE INSTITUTE LOCATED IN RICHMOND CALIFORNIA. THIS EFFORT IS A COLLABORATION WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO ONE OF OUR LABOR SPEAKERS IS FROM THERE AND WITH THE FIVE GYRES INSTITUTE WARNED. OUR WORK HERE IS PART OF SFE EYES OVERALL MISSION TO PROVIDE SCIENTIFIC SUPPORT AND TOOLS FOR DECISION MAKING. SO THIS IS WHY WE WANT TO BRING THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION TO ALL OF YOU. SO QUICK WE WILL TALK ABOUT ALL THE MONITORING. SKEWS ME JUST TRYING TO GET OUT THERE WE GOT GOT MY FLIGHT ADVANCED ALL RIGHT LET'S TALK ABOUT STUDY DESIGN WE DID A WHOLE LOT OF MONITORING AS PART OF THIS BIG THREE YEAR EFFORT. SO FOR THE BAY. WE LOOK AT MICRO PLASTICS IN THE SURFACE WATER SEEM DISKO BAY. WE ALSO LOOK AT MICRO PLASTICS IN THE SEDIMENT AT THE BOTTOM. AND THEN WE CUT FASHION WE EXTRACTED BIVALVES ARE FILTER FEEDERS FROM THE BAY AND LOOK AT MICRO PLASTICS IN THESE TISSUES AS WELL. WE WENT OUT THE GOLDEN GATE AND WE DID MONITORING OF THE SURFACE WATER IN THE NATIONAL MARINE SANCTUARIES. AND THEN WE WENT UPSTREAM HOW WE LOOK AT THE POLLUTION PATHWAYS SO THESE ARE WATER CENTER BEING DISCHARGED TO THE BANK AND FROM WHICH SOME OF THESE MICROPLASTICS MIGHT BE DIRECT SO. WE LOOKED AT WASTE WATER THAT'S ALL THE DOWN THE DRAIN DISCHARGES THAT GO TO THE SEWER SYSTEM THE WASTE WATER TREATMENT FACILITY THERE'S A LOT OF TREATMENT A LOT OF REMOVAL OF MICROPLASTICS AND THEN THAT TREATED WASTE WATER IS DISCHARGED TO THE BAY. WE ALSO LOOK AT STORMONT- NO THAT'S THE RAINFALL THAT HITS OUR STREETS IN OUR LANDSCAPES AND FROM THERE MOST OF THE STORM DRAIN OR THE CREEK OR THE STREAM. AND THEN ENDS UP IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY LARGELY UNTREATED. ALL RIGHT SO THAT'S THE MONITORING WE DID WHAT DID WE FIND. WE FOUND HIGH LEVELS OF MICROPLASTICS IN BAY WATER AND SEDIMENT RELATIVE TO OTHER WATER BODIES NEAR BIG URBAN CENTERS. THIS LITTLE BAR CHART IS OUR SURFACE WATER ABUNDANCE AND YOU CAN SEE THAT OUR MAJOR EFFORT IN TWENTY NINETEEN AS WELL AS A PILOT STUDY IN THE WET SEASON OF TWENTY SIXTEEN. SHOW MUCH HIGHER LEVELS OF MICROPLASTICS COMPARED TO OTHER MAJOR WATER BODIES WHERE WE HAVE SIMILAR KINDS OF DATA DEVELOPED SO FAR. SO WHAT WE THINK IS GOING ON HERE IS THAT WE'VE GOT A REALLY DENSE URBAN POPULATION AROUND THE DAY. WE'VE ALSO GOT WELL YOU COULD SAY THE BAY IS A SMALLER WATER BODY COMPARED TO SOMETHING BIG LIKE A GREAT LAKE. AND THEN WE GOT THIS CONSTRAINT INTERCHANGE WITH THE PACIFIC OCEAN SO LITTLE LAST FLASHING AND DILUTION. AND THESE FACTORS TOGETHER TO MAKE THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY A VALUABLE PLACE TO LOOK FOR THESE PERSISTENT CONTAMINANTS THEY CAN REALLY BUILD UP SOME PLASTIC CAN BUILD UP IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY. WHEN IT COMES TO THE TYPES OF PARTICLES WE SAW. WE SAW A LOT OF FIBERS. ARE STILL ALMOST THREE QUARTERS OF THE PARTICLES WE SON SURFACE WATER OR FIBERS AND THEN CLOSE TO TWO THIRDS AROUND TWO THIRDS IN SENTIMENT. YOU CAN HEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT FIBERS ON AS WELL AS SOME OF THE OTHER TYPES OF PARTICLES WE SAW. IT ALSO TURNS OUT THE FISSION BIBLES WERE. PRIMARILY INGESTING OR- HAD IN THEIR GUTS FIBERS. SO THESE TWO BY BART YEAH HI CHARTS ARE ON THE LEFT IS A COUPLE OFFICIALLY EXAMINED ON THE RIGHT IT'S THE COUPLE OF FILTER FEEDERS AND BOTH OF THEM ARE LARGELY THE BLUE COLOR SIGNIFYING FIBERS WERE THAT CONTENTS OF THAT THE TISSUES THAT WE EXAMINED SO NOT ONLY ARE THESE FIBERS IN OUR RETIREMENT BUT THEY SEEM TO BE INGESTED. BY THE ORGANISMS THAT WE EXAMINE SAN FRANCISCO BAY. WE'RE GOOD FIBERS BECOMING FROM. ONE PATHWAY IT'S ALREADY SEEN SOME SOME GOOD WORK HERE AND ELSEWHERE IS THINKING ABOUT FIBERS COMING THROUGH WASTEWATER AND SO THIS GETS TO THE FACT WE HAVE A LOT OF SYNTHETIC GARMENTS IN OUR LIVES ENHANCE WE THROW OUR SYNTHETIC TEXTILES IN THE WASHING MACHINE. THERE'S THE ABRASION AND THAT CAN LEAD TO SOME SHEDDING OF FIBERS THAT GOES INTO THE WASH WATER AND THEN HEADS TO THE TREATMENT FACILITY. NOT TRIMMING CAMERA REMOVE A LOT OF MICROPLASTICS WE MENTIONED A LITTLE BIT ALREADY- BUT THERE IS SOME LEVEL THAT REMAINS IN THE TREATED WATER GETS DISCHARGED TO THE BANK. SO FOR OUR STUDY WE LOOKED AT THE EIGHT LARGEST FACILITIES JUST CHARGING TO THE BANK AND WE DID FIND MICROPLASTICS IN THESE AT IN THE SAMPLES. ARE AVERAGE LEVELS OF POINT ZERO SIX PARTICLES PER LITER AND FIBERS BEING COMMENT SO THIS SUPPORTS THE IDEA THAT FIBERS AND OTHER MICROPLASTICS CAN END UP IN THE BAY. THROUGH THE PATHWAY OF WASTE WATER. THIS IS NOT THE ONLY PATHWAY ACTUALLY STORM WATER TURNED OUT TO BE A BIT OF A SURPRISE FOR US A MUCH BIGGER DEAL. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT STORMWATER SAMPLES WE SAW FAR HIGHER CONCENTRATIONS OF ALL THE PARTICLES FIBRES IN ON FIBERS IN OUR STORMWATER COMPARED TO OUR WASTE WATER. NOW THIS ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT STORM WATER NINE GENERAL GENERALLY IN THE BAY AREA AND IN MUCH OF CALIFORNIA IS NOT TREATED SO THERE'S NO CHANCE FOR THE PARTICLES TO SETTLE OUT OR BE REMOVED THROUGH TREATMENT AND SO THAT THEY CAN RUSH RIGHT INTO WATERWAYS. NOW WE CAN TAKE THESE KIND OF CONCENTRATIONS AND WE CAN PLUG THEM INTO MODELS TO TRYING TO COME UP WITH THE- ANNUAL DISCHARGE OF THE ANNUAL LOAN FROM EACH OF THESE PATHWAYS TO THE DAY. AND SO WHEN WE MADE THESE ARE MODELING ESTIMATES. WE DETERMINED AN ESTIMATE OF SEVENTEEN BILLION MICROPLASTIC PARTICLES ENTERING THE BASE YOUR WASTE WATER. WHEN WE GET AT A DIFFERENT CALCULATION FOR STORMWATER. IS THAT RAINFALL THAT RUNS THROUGH THE LANDSCAPE. WE ACTUALLY GOT A FINAL US SEVEN TRILLION. STICKS AND THESE MODELS THERE'S A NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT GOES THAT GO INTO THESE MODELS AND YOU CAN ADJUST THOSE ASSUMPTIONS BUT NO MATTER HOW WE ADJUSTED THEM. WE STILL SAW THAT STORM WATER AND DISCHARGING OVER THREE HUNDRED TIMES MORE MICRO PLASTICS AND WASTEWATER. SO ALTHOUGH THESE PATHWAYS ARE IMPORTANT THIS STUDY REALLY OPENED OUR EYES TO STORMWATER WHICH HAD NOT BEEN. INVESTIGATED VERY MUCH IN THE LITERATURE AND SO WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO DO SOME FOLLOW UP WORK FUNDED BY THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL TO TRYING TO EXAMINE POTENTIAL SOURCES FOR STORMWATER. THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL ALSO FUNDING A STUDY ON MICRO PLASTICS AND WASTEWATER SO A LOT OF EFFORT HERE TO UNDERSTAND THESE PATHWAYS BECAUSE IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT THAT. THE PARTICLES IN THE PATHWAYS MAYBE WE CAN GET THESE PARTICLES OUT OF THE PATHWAYS AND PROTECT OUR WATERS. NOW ONE OF THE TYPES OF PARTICLE IT WE SOUGHT ESPECIALLY IN STORMWATER. ALSO IN OUR BASEMENT WHERE THESE BLACK REVEREND FRAGMENTS AND WE BELIEVE MANY OF THESE ARE DERIVED FROM TIRES. AND THIS IS PART OF ACTUAL THAT THAT. DON'T THE NECESSARY FUNCTION OF TIRES YOU KNOW THE GRIP ON THE ROAD THIS IS HOW THE TIRES ARE KEEPING US SAFE BUT IT ALSO. AS THE TIRES RIVING IT'S SHEDDING LITTLE BITS OF ROBERT AND THESE CAN BE WASHED INTO WATERWAYS WE SAW HIGH LEVELS IN OUR STORM WATER ALMOST HALF THE PARTICLES WERE THESE BLACK REFEREE FRAGMENTS. LET'S COME TIMES EXTRA IMPORTANT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE INGREDIENTS IN THE RIVER. JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO A BIG STUDY CAME OUT IN SCIENCE WE GOT TO BE INVOLVED WITH IT WHERE SITE TEAM OF SCIENTISTS IN WASHINGTON STATE IDENTIFY A SPECIFIC PRESERVATIVE CHEMICAL ENTIRE RIVER. THAT TRANSFORMS IN THE ENVIRONMENT TO AN EXTREMELY LETHAL TOXICANT FOR CO HOSTING AND- CALL SALMON ARE THREATENED AND ENDANGERED IN A NUMBER OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TRIBUTARIES. OUR ROLE IN THIS STUDY WE GRAB SOME STORM WATER SAMPLES FROM THE BAY AREA THESE DREAMS DO NOT SUPPORT COHO- BUT WHEN WE SENT THESE SAMPLES TO THE LAB THANK FOUND LETHAL LEVELS UNDER TIRE CONTAMINANT IN THESE IN THESE BAY AREA STORMWATER SAMPLES SO THIS IS IMPORTANT. I STRESSOR THAT THAT MUST BE CONSIDERED IN ANY STREAM WHERE CALL HOW ARE CURRENTLY LIVING OR WHERE THEY MIGHT BE REINTRODUCED WE WOULD CERTAINLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS. CHEMICAL STRESSOR WERE NOT CAUSING PROBLEMS. FOR COHO POPULATIONS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT THESE PARTICLES IS NOT JUST PHYSICAL CONTAMINANTS BUT ALSO AS CARRIERS OF TOXIC INGREDIENTS. I TURNED OUT THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL IS TAKING A LOOK AT TIRE INGREDIENTS AS PART OF THEIR SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM. YES SOME ATTENTION IN PARTICULAR ON THIS PRESERVATIVE AGENT THAT'S JUST BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THE SOURCE OF THIS CALL HOME TOXICANT. AND SO. WHAT A GREAT OUTCOME FOR THIS KIND OF EFFORT COULD BE AT TIRE MADE US SAFER INGREDIENTS AND THAT WAY EVEN IF IT'S SHUTTING LITTLE BITS OF PLASTIC OR RUBBER IN THESE THESE. PIECES OUT OF. RIGHT CONTAMINATION ARE NOT HARMING THE WILD. NOW WE SAW OTHER SOURCES OF MICROPLASTICS AS WELL BESIDES THE TIRES OBVIOUSLY MENTION FIBERS WE SEE POLYESTER ACRYLIC MANY OF THE SORT OF CLOTHING TYPE FIBERS IN OUR CLOSETS TODAY. DOCTOR COTTON MENTIONED CELLULOSE ACETATE ARE BACK CAN BE IN CIGARETTE FILTERS SO WE SAW THE NUMBER SIX RANKED CELLULOSE ACETATE FIBERS THAT COULD BE DERIVED FROM CIGARETTE POLLUTION. WE DID SEE SOME MICROBEADS AS WELL IN OUR WASTE WATER I NOW IN THE US. MICROBEADS ARE BANNED AND RINSE OFF PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS. SO THESE MICROBEADS COULD BE DERIVED FROM OLDER PRODUCTS STILL IN USE OR PERHAPS FROM A TYPE OF PRODUCT THAT'S OUTSIDE THAT RINSE OFF PERSONAL USE. OR PERSONAL CARE GROUPING OF PRODUCTS. AND THEN FINALLY WE SAW PARTICLES THAT COULD BE DERIVED FROM SINGLE USE PLASTICS OF THIS LITTLE EXAMPLE UP HERE IT'S THAT SOME PHONES POLYSTYRENE SO YOU COULD IMAGINE THAT COULD BE DERIVED FROM YOU KNOW SOME THAT FOAM PACKAGING SURROUNDING A PRODUCT FOR PROTECTIONOR PERHAPS AT. FOAM TAKEOUT CONTAINER- SO WE SEE PARTICLES LIKE THAT THAT COULD BE RELATED TO SINGLE USE PLASTIC IN OUR PAIN FACT. SO JUST TO SUMMARIZE THE KEY FINDINGS HERE- WE DID SEE HIGH LEVELS OF MICROPLASTICS IN OUR SAN FRANCISCO BAY. FIBERS WERE PARTICULARLY WIDESPREAD AMONG THE DIVERSE TYPES OF PARTICLES WE OBSERVED. WE SEE STORM WATER ISN'T AS AN IMPORTANT PATHWAY FOR FURTHER WORK IN ONE THAT HASN'T BEEN STUDIED QUITE AS MUCH AS WASTE WATER YEAH. EVERYTHING OF TIRES AS A SOURCE OF MICROPLASTICS AS WELL AS TOXIC CHEMICALS SO WE DEFINITELY WANT TO THINK ABOUT. NOT JUST THESE PHYSICAL PARTICLES BUT THE INGREDIENTS THAT MAKE UP THE PLASTIC. IF WE CAN MAKE PLASTIC LESS TOXIC THAN THE MICROPLASTICS THEMSELVES WILL ALSO BE LESS TOXIC TO OUR WILD WHICH- I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR STUDY FUNDERS. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION THERE'S A U. R. L. UP THERE FOR MANY MORE DETAILS ON THIS LARGE STUDY FINDINGS AND THIS IS MY FINAL SLIDE IF THAT. IF THAT COAST WANTS TO TAKE BACK THE SELECTION. ALL THANK YOU FOR THAT EXCELLENT- TALK ON THE EXCELLENT WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE- THE NEXT SPEAKER IS DOCTOR VIOLENT. DR VIOLET ROENICK WITH THE ORANGE COUNTY SANITATION TO TALK TO US ABOUT. WHAT IS KNOWN OF MICROPLASTICS BEING FOUND IN WASTEWATER- SO DR ROENICK YOU MADE UP FIFTEEN MINUTES FOR YOUR PRESENTATION WHICH I SEE YOU HAVE UP ON THE SCREEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH TO REMEMBER DR QUIRK AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE INVITATION AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC. AND THANK YOU ALSO TO ALL OF MY FELLOW PANELISTS. MY NAME IS VIOLET ROENICK I'M A SENIOR SCIENTIST AT THE ORANGE COUNTY SANITATION DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA. I'VE SPENT THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WORKING ON MICROPLASTICS WERE FOCUSED MY ATTENTION TO HELP DEVELOP METHODS TO MEASURE THESE PARTICLES. AND I'VE WORKED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THIS EMERGING CONTAMINANT WASTE WATER AND THE ENVIRONMENT. AND TODAY MY GOAL IS TO PRESENT A BRIEF SUMMARY OF WHAT WE KNOW AND WHAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE PREVALENCE OF MICROPLASTICS IN WASTE WATER. THE ORANGE COUNTY SANITATION DISTRICT OR OC ST PROVIDES WASTEWATER COLLECTION TREATMENT AND RECYCLING SERVICES FOR OVER TWO POINT SIX MILLION PEOPLE. OF CENTRAL AND NORTHERN ORANGE COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA. WE TREAT OVER A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE MILLION GALLONS PER DAY OR AND GT. AND ARE PROUD PARTNERS WITH THE ORANGE COUNTY WATER DISTRICT IN THE PRODUCTION OF OVER A HUNDRED M. GT. OF TREATED RECYCLED WATER FOR OUR GROUNDWATER REPLENISHMENT SYSTEM. THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF MANY OF OUR WORK AS A RESOURCE RECOVERY AGENCY. AND WE'RE ALSO MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SANITATION AGENCIES ARE KASA. AN AGENCY THAT'S BEEN A STRONG AND EARLY SUPPORTER OF MICROPLASTIC POLICIES. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN COSTA CO SPONSORED SENATE BILL TWELVE SIXTY THREE THE STATEWIDE MICROPLASTICS STRATEGY AUTHORED BY SENATOR PORTANTINO. AS WELL AS THE TWENTY FIFTEEN STATEWIDE BAN ON MICROPLASTICS. THE CORE OF ASSISTANCE MISSION CENTERS ON THE PROTECTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THIS BECAUSE WE'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT OUR ROLE AS ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDS AND OUR MISSION HAS BEEN OF PARTICULAR DRIVING FORCE MOTIVATING US TO INVESTIGATE MICROPLASTICS AS AN EMERGING ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE. AND WE CREDIT A LOT OF OUR SUCCESS IN THE QUALITY OF OUR DISCHARGE TO OUR EXTENSIVE SOURCE CONTROL PROGRAM WHICH I ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AS JUST ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT WE USE TO PREVENT CONTAMINANTS FROM ENTERING OUR TREATMENT PLANTS IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO BEFORE WE DISCUSS THE PREVALENCE OF MICROPLASTICS IN WASTE WATER I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE. AND CONSIDER ALL THE WAYS THAT MICROPLASTIC CAN ENTER THE ENVIRONMENT. AND I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON THIS GRAPHIC MADE BY FELLOW PANELIST DR CHELSEA ROCKMAN THAT DEPICTS THE DIVERSITY AND SOURCES AND PATHWAYS OF MICROPLASTIC. AND HERE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THESE WO TERMS- OR SOURCES ARE WHERE MICROPLASTICS ARE PRODUCED AND ORIGINATE. AND WHERE THE PATHWAYS HERE BELOW ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR TRANSPORTING MICROPLASTICS FROM THEIR SOURCE TO THE ENVIRONMENT. PATHWAYS CAN INCLUDE RIVERS AND WINS ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION DIRECT IMPORTS DIFFERENT TYPES OF RUNOFF AND WASTEWATER OF COURSE. AND ONE LAST THING I'D LIKE TO UNDERSCORE HERE IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF DEGRADED AND MISMANAGED WASTE AND LITTER IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE EVERY PIECE OF MICROPLASTIC THAT MAY ONE DAY BE A SOURCE OF MICROPLASTIC IN THE ENVIRONMENT. AND I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT AND APPLIED THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL OPC FOR THEIR RECENT UNVEILING OF RECOMMENDED ACTIONS TO ADDRESS PLASTIC POLLUTION AND CALIFORNIA'S COASTAL AND MARINE ECOSYSTEM. THIS IS REALLY A BOLD AND NECESSARY STEP TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM AND WE HOPE TO SEE MORE OF THIS. SO IT SWITCHING GEARS NOW TO WASTE WATER SPECIFICALLY WHAT DO WE KNOW. WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS OUR RECEIVERS OF MICROPLASTICS FROM DOMESTIC COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL UPSTREAM SOURCES. USING CONVENTIONAL WASTEWATER TREATMENT TECHNOLOGIES THEY ARE ABLE TO REMOVE THE VAST MAJORITY OF MICROPLASTICS FROM ROSTER WHICH WHICH I'LL DISCUSS IN MORE DETAIL IN A FEW SITES. BUT THEY WERE NOT DESIGNED FOR THIS PURPOSE THEY WERE DESIGNED FOR HUMAN WASTE WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT CONCEPT WHEN UNDERSTANDING THEIR ROLE. NOW THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT SOURCES OF MICROPLASTIC BETTER CONVEYED OR CAN BE CONVEYED TO WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS AND THIS CAN BE SPECIFIC TO DIFFERENT WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS. THE SOURCES OF PRIMARY MICROPLASTICS ON THIS LEFT SIDE OF THE GRAPHIC- THESE ARE MICRO PLASTICS THAT HAVE BEEN PURPOSELY DESIGNED TO BE MICRO SIZED. INCLUDE PLASTIC PALLETS OR ACCIDENTALLY RELEASED- SORRY PLASTIC PELLETS OR ACCIDENTALLY RELEASED PLASTICS DURING MANUFACTURE. INDUSTRIAL ABRASIVES AND PRODUCTION MATERIALS AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS. AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF SECONDARY MICROPLASTICS HERE ON THE RIGHT SIDE. WILL INCLUDE PLASTIC FIBERS RELEASED DURING THE WASHING OF SYNTHETIC CLOTHING AS WELL AS TIRE WEAR FOR SYSTEMS THAT CO MINGLE URBAN ENOUGH OR STORM WATER. AND DEGRADED AND RELEASED FRAGMENTS FROM LARGER MACRO PLASTICS PAINTS. ALL OF THESE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE LOADINGS THAT COME INTO WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS AND THEIR ROSTER WHICH. SO WHAT IS THE GENERAL FATE AND TRANSPORT OF MICROPLASTICS IN WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS YOU MIGHT RECOGNIZE THIS AS A SIMILAR VERSION TO WHAT DOCTOR COFFIN PRESENTED. AND I'D LIKE TO JUST GO INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL HERE. SO THIS SIMPLIFIED GRAPHIC SUMMARIZES WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT DIFFERENT STAGES OF WASTEWATER TREATMENT. AND HOW EFFECTIVE THEY ARE IN REMOVING MICROPLASTICS FROM THE AFFLUENT. IF YOU CONSIDER THE INCOMING INFLUENCE AS HAVING 1100% OF THE MICROPLASTIC LOAD FROM ALL OF THESE POTENTIAL SOURCES. PRELIMINARY TREATMENT AS YOU CAN SEE HERE CONSISTING OF SCREENS AND GRIT REMOVAL REMOVES APPROXIMATELY 35259% OF THE MICROPLASTIC LOAD. PRIMARY TREATMENT CONSISTING OF DIFFERENT SKIMMING AND SETTLING PROCESS USE CAN REMOVE UP WHICH CONSISTS OF MORE BIOLOGICAL TREATMENT CAN REMOVE UP 286299% OF THE MICROPLASTIC LOAD. AND FINALLY ADVANCED TERTIARY TREATMENTS CONSISTING OF DIFFERENT FILTRATION TECHNOLOGIES CAN REMOVE UP REALLY IS THAT USING CONVENTIONAL WASTEWATER TREATMENT TECHNOLOGIES WE ARE ABLE TO REMOVE THE VAST MAJORITY OF MICROPLASTICS FROM RAW SEWAGE. BUT AS DR COFFIN- SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER THE TREATMENT DOESN'T SIMPLY DESTROY MICROPLASTICS BUT TRANSFERS THEM TO THE SOLID TRACTION. SO SPECIFICALLY THOSE REMOVED BY PRELIMINARY AND A SMALL PORTION OF PRIMARY TREATMENT ARE SENT TO LANDFILLS AND THE REMAINDER ARE TRANSFERRED TO SLUDGE WHICH IS FURTHER TREATED TO BECOME SAFE AND RELIABLE BIOSOLIDS. NO RESEARCH ON THE PREVALENCE AND THE FATE AND TRANSPORT OF MICROPLASTICS IN BIOSOLIDS IS STILL IN THE EARLY PHASES WE DO HAVE SOME UNDERSTANDING BUT THERE ARE MANY DATA GAPS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS BRIEFLY IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES OF THIS TALK. SO IN TERMS OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF MICROPLASTICS IN WASTE WATER IN THE AFFLUENT. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THE MOST COMMON FORM IS MICROPLASTICS AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS GRAPH HERE. FOLLOWED BY IRREGULARLY SHAPED FRAGMENTS WHICH OFTEN DO INCLUDE FILMS AND PHONES AS WELL. NOW THIS TREND IS LIKELY A REFLECTION OF THE VAST NUMBER OF SYNTHETIC FIBERS THAT ARE RELEASED THROUGH BOTH DOMESTIC AND COMMERCIAL LAUNDRY EFFLUENTS THAT ARE SENT TO WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS EVERY DAY. BUT SOMETHING ELSE I'D LIKE TO NOTE HERE IS THE INCREDIBLE SPREAD IN THE ESTIMATES YOU CAN SEE BETWEEN ERROR BARS. WHICH HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THE UNCERTAINTY AND VARIABILITY IN THESE NUMBERS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND. AND IN PRACTICE THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF DIVERSITY AND MICROPLASTIC SHAPES AND COLORS AND SIZES. THAT CAN MAKE THEIR IDENTIFICATION VERY CHALLENGING. SO THESE PHOTOS ARE HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM SOME OF OUR WASTE WATER SAMPLES COLLECTED AT DIFFERENT TREATMENT LEVELS. AND THE GOAL HERE IS TO SHOW THAT OUR DEFINITION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF MICROPLASTICS ARE EVOLVING. FROM BRIGHTLY COLORED HARD FRAGMENTS OF PLASTIC TO. CLEAR AN ODDLY SHAPED PARTICLES TAN COLORED PHONES AND MANY MANY DIFFERENT COMPLEX ADDITIVES AND FILLERS. SO NOW THAT I'VE DISCUSSED WHAT WE DO KNOW I WOULD LIKE TO TRANSITION TO THE CHALLENGES ON THE KNOWLEDGE GAPS SURROUNDING MICRO PLASTICS AND WASTEWATER. IN OTHER WORDS WHAT DO WE NOT KNOW AND WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO BETTER. AND IMPORTANTLY WHAT ARE WE DOING NOW TO TACKLE THESE UNKNOWNS AND WHAT CAN BE DONE IN THE FUTURE. SO THE FIRST MAJOR CHALLENGE IS REALLY RECONCILING THAT HIGH VARIABILITY THAT WE SEE IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE ON ESTIMATES OF MICROPLASTICS IN WASTE WATER. THIS VERY ABILITY COULD BE DUE TO MANY DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT WE NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND BUT ONE OF THE MOST BASIC IS THAT WE LACK COMMON AND STANDARD METHODS TO SAMPLE AND MEASURE THESE CONTAMINANTS. AND ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE'RE TACKLING THIS IS THE PARTICIPATION IN EFFORTS TO DEVELOP. EVALUATE AND RECOMMEND STANDARD METHODS FOR DIFFERENT SAMPLE TYPES. AND HEARD LIKE TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COASTAL WATER RESEARCH PROJECT OR SQUARE. THEY'VE REALLY BEEN LEADING THE EFFORT IN CALIFORNIA. DR COFFIN TO DESCRIBE THIS A LITTLE BIT EARLIER AND WE ARE JUST ONE OF THE MANY LABORATORIES INVOLVED. THIS EFFORT IS CURRENTLY FOCUSED ON DRINKING WATER FOR SB FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO- AND DOES NOT INCLUDE SIMULATED WASTEWATER SAMPLES BUT WITH GREATER FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES AND REQUIREMENTS FOR STANDARDIZED METHODS WE COULD REALLY SOLIDIFIED INFORMED RELIABLE ESTIMATES ACROSS SOURCES AND DIFFERENT PATHWAYS INCLUDING WASTEWATER AND BIOSOLIDS. A SECOND KNOWLEDGE GAP HERE IS UNDERSTANDING HOW ALL OTHER FACTORS AFFECT THE PREVALENCE AND MICROPLASTICS IN A WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS FROM THE PROPORTION OF INDUSTRIAL INPUTS TO THE CONTRIBUTION OF STORM WATER DIVERSIONS OR URBAN RUNOFF. AND TO UNDERSTAND HOW ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT FACTORS AFFECT OVERALL REMOVAL FROM THIS PATHWAY TO THE ENVIRONMENT. NOW TO TACKLE THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL OR OPC HAS RECENTLY FUNDED SQUARE UP TO CONDUCT A PRELIMINARY STUDY TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS. WE AT OC SAD ARE ENGAGED WITH KASA AND SEVERAL SISTER WASTE WATER AGENCIES AS PARTNERS ON THIS ENDEAVOR. AND TOGETHER WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS DEVELOPING HIGH QUALITY DATA TO INFORM RELIABLE REMOVAL ESTIMATES OF MICROPLASTICS IN CALIFORNIA'S WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS. SO THE FINAL BIG CHALLENGE THAT I'D LIKE TO MENTION IS THAT WE ARE STILL IN THE EARLY STAGES OF UNDERSTANDING THE BIG PICTURE AND RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF ALL SOURCES AND PATHWAYS TO THE ENVIRONMENT. AND ONE OF THE CENTRAL DATA CAPS BUT I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT HERE IS THE FATE OF MICROPLASTICS IN LAND APPLY BIOSOLIDS ESPECIALLY AS IT COMPARES TO OTHER AGRICULTURAL SOURCES SUCH AS THE USE OF PLASTIC TARPS. I WHICH HAS BECOME QUITE COMMON FOR THE CONTRIBUTION BY ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION WHICH I BELIEVE WILL HEAR MORE ABOUT LATER ON IN THIS IN THE SECOND PANEL. THIS IS A MAJOR UNKNOWN AND WHILE TREATED BIOSOLIDS ARE ONLY CURRENTLY APPLY TO LESS THAN ZERO POINT 5% OF ALL AGRICULTURAL LANDS IN CALIFORNIA. IS SOMETHING WE DO NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND. TO TACKLE THESE QUESTIONS WE THINK IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE HAVE THE METHODS IN PLACE TO CONFIDENTLY MEASURE THESE CONTAMINANTS FROM ALL PATHWAYS. USING HIGH QUALITY STUDIES. I'D LIKE TO CLOSE BY STRESSING THAT WE CANNOT IGNORE SOURCE CONTROL IS A KEY COMPONENT IN ITS EFFECTIVENESS AND ITS INFLUENCE IN SOLVING THIS EMERGING ISSUE. AND THE BEST WAY REALLY IT IS THE BEST WAY REALLY TO REDUCE MICROPLASTICS- IS TO REDUCE OUR OUR USE OF PLASTIC OVERALL. WE ALSO NEED STANDARD VALIDATED AND ROBUST METHODS FOR WASTEWATER AND BIOSOLIDS SAMPLES. MOVEMENTS WE ARE MORE CONFIDENT IN OUR METHODS WE CAN BE MORE CONFIDENT THAT WE'RE COMPARING APPLES TO APPLES. ARE FRAGMENTS TO PREGNANCY. AND FINALLY IT'S IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT AND PROMOTE COMPREHENSIVE SOURCE IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT THROUGH INCREASED FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES AND RESPONSIBLE LEGISLATION. SO I THOUGHT I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND WE IN CASTLE LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING IN FURTHER DIALOGUE ON THIS IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU DOCTOR AND- I WANTED TO INTRODUCE OUR A CHAIR THE CHAIR OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE THREE OF US. WALL MY CONCERNS- IN MY COMMITTEE DEAL WITH DRINKING WATER- THE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE DEALS WITH- THE OVERALL POLLUTION THAT WE HAVE FROM PLASTICS. AND THE SENATORS ALSO HAVE- YOU ARE HERE TODAY ALSO HAVE- RESPONSIBILITY TO LOOK AT DRINKING WATER AND OVERALL POLLUTION. WHICH IS WHY I'VE ASKED THEM HERE TODAY- ASSEMBLY MEMBER REVERSED YOU WANNA MAKE A COMMENT. AND THEN WE'LL GET TO QUESTIONS. I JUST I JUST WANNA THANK YOU DOCTOR CORK FOR INVITING ME TO PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S HEARING VERY INFORMATIVE FOR ME AND JUST AN IMPORTANT ISSUE- FOR BOTH OF OUR COMMITTEES AS YOU MENTIONED THANK YOU. OKAY NOW OPEN IT UP FOR- QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND- AND THE OTHER ATTENDEES. AND MR STERN IF HE WANTS TO SAY SOMETHING MISTER VICE CHAIR RICHARD CLARIFICATION AS TO HOW BIG IS A NANOMETER. IS THAT THE SIZE OF A RICE OR SIZE OF A PENNY HOW BIG IS A- VERY VERY SMALL IT IS ONE OF OUR- EXPERTS- I JUST. WANT TO ASK YOURSELF FOR EVEN IF YOU ARE. RIGHT NOW IT'S MUCH SMALLER THAN THE WIDTH OF YOUR HAIR OKAY SO YOU CAN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND AYE SO IT'S UNDER A MICROSCOPE IS WHETHER THEY'RE ON WITH THE ATHLETES MICROSCOPIC SO I AM VERY MICROSCOPIC VERY VERY SHORT OKAY VERY VERY SMALL COMMENTED IN THE MOUNTAINS FOR MYSELF FOR PEOPLE LOOKING AT HOME. YEAH. SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. ONE ONE HUNDRED. MILLIONTH OF AN INCH. AND THEN UP WITH THEM THE BILL LANGUAGE OF SB FOURTEEN TWENTY TO HAVE THESE DATES. HAVE THEY MET THE DATES OF THE CLARIFICATION BECAUSE IT SAYS THE STATE BOARD WILL CALL CLARIFIED JULY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY. SHALL ADOPT A DEFINITION AND IF THEY HAVE THEY MET MET THOSE ARE HAVE A OF IT SHE IN OFFICE LET'S SEE I SEE SOME NOT EXCELLENT I HAVE OKAY YES FOR AND OF COURSE WE HAVEN'T MET THAT JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE YET. BUT WE SHOULD BE GETTING PRETTY CLOSE WITH A FEW MORE MONTHS. OKAY PERFECT THANK YOU OKAY- DOCTOR ARE. DO YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ABOUT HOW THE WORK HAS BEEN GOING. YES SO THE WORK SO FAR HAS BEEN ARE IT'S BEEN VERY FAST PACED. THE SAY THE LEAST- BUT WE ARE ON TRACK TO MEET THE JULY FIRST DEADLINE FOR THE REMAINING REQUIREMENTS OF SENATE BILL FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO AND I'LL JUST ADD THAT THE ONLY REASON THAT WERE ABLE TO MEET THESE DEADLINES IS DUE TO OUR INCREDIBLE GROUP OF COLLABORATORS AROUND THE WORLD- OVER FORTY LAPS FROM SEVEN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES PARTICIPATING IN THE METHOD EVALUATION STUDY. ALLEN'S REALLY THE WORLD'S EXPERTS FOR MICROPLASTICS ARE FOR THE HUMAN HEALTH EFFECTS PANEL. YES AND I'LL SAY- IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY AND TOXIC MATERIALS- COMMITTEE WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT LEGISLATION THAT WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT- INTERNATIONAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION PARTICULARLY THE EUROPEAN UNION- IT'S ONE WORLD- ASSEMBLY MEMBER- REBECCA. OUR QUE HAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WELL I WANT TO THANK ALL OF OUR PANELISTS SO FAR THIS IS INCREDIBLY DEPRESSING BUT INTERESTING SO THANK YOU FOR ENLIGHTENING US TODAY. THE VAST PROBLEMS WERE FACING WHEN IT COMES TO MICROPLASTICS AND ONE QUESTION FOR I'M REBEKAH SUTTON IF WE COULD GET HER BACK. HOW THIS ALL WORKS BUT. YES I'M HERE THANK YOU REBECCA AND SO DOCTORS AND YOU MENTIONED- HOW MANY OF THE FIBERS IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY WERE RELATED TO RELEASE FROM TIRES- AND IT'S INTERESTING TO ME I HAD A CHANCE TO. CONVERSE WITH DR GRANT YESTERDAY WHO IS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF OREGON WHO'S DONE THE RESEARCH OFF THE COAST OF OREGON AND SHE SAID IT WAS A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE. OF WHAT THEY FOUND IN THE CLAMS AND ANIMALS THEY LOOKED OUT IN OREGON SO I'M WONDERING WHY THERE WOULD BE SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE ON THE SOURCE OF MICROPLASTICS HERE IN THE BAY AREA. FIRST IS WHAT WE'RE SEEING ELSEWHERE IS THAT AS A RESULT OF THE URBAN ENVIRONMENT OR WHAT. HAVE YOU LOOKED AT DIFFERENT STUDIES AND WHAT MICROPLASTICS ARE PRESENT AND WHAT MIGHT EXPLAIN THOSE DIFFERENCES. SURE YEAH THESE ARE IT THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. WE DIDN'T GENERALLY SEE FIBERS AND THE COUPLE SPECIES THAT WE EXAMINED. WHEN IT COMES TO THE TIRE PARTICLES WHERE WE OBSERVE DOES WAS THE STORM WATER AS WELL AS THE SENTIMENT. NOW THEY HAVE BEEN OBSERVED IN. CHARLESTON I BELIEVE IN IN FISH SO THERE ARE NOW OBSERVATIONS OF TIRE PARTICLES IN SOME SPECIES AND I SUSPECT WE JUST DID NOT PICK THE RIGHT SPECIES THAT WOULD BE CONSUMING THE TIRE ARTICLE SO WE MAY HAVE PICKED. SPECIES THAT CONSUMES MORE TYPICAL TYPES OF MICROPLASTICS RATHER THAN SLAP OUT. OR WERE. SENTENCED ORIENTED TOWARD. THAT TIRE SHAPED PARTICLES. THANK YOU AND THEN I HAD ANOTHER QUESTION WHICH IS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PREVALENCE OF THIS IN OUR- A. WATERS AND THAT ORGANISMS IN OUR- WATERS BUT- I DIDN'T HEAR ANYONE MENTIONING THE PREVALENCE OF THIS IN OUR DRINKING WATER. WHICH I IMAGINE COULD ALSO BE THE CASE GIVE ANY INSIGHT INTO THAT. WE DID NOT EXAMINE DRINKING WATER IN OUR STUDY BUT I BELIEVE DOCTOR COFFIN COULD SPEAK TO THAT. PROFIT ARE WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO MONITORING DATA FOR DRINKING WATER IN CALIFORNIA AND TO BE QUITE HONEST THERE'S REALLY ONLY A HANDFUL STUDIES THAT I'VE EVER LOOKED AT MICROPLASTICS IN DRINKING WATER- THAT HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED. BUT WE WILL BE MONITORING- THIS LATER THIS YEAR AS WE ADOPT OUR FOUR YEARS SIMPLY ANALYSIS PLAN BY JULY FIRST. THANK YOU IT SEEMS LIKE WE NEED SOME DATA ON THAT OBVIOUSLY THAT'S BEING CONSUMED BY OUR CONSTITUENTS EVERY DAY SO. NEED TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE NOT A SIGNIFICANT SORT OF REASON- ALTHOUGH WE WERE LOOKING HERE AT THE BAY. AND DR SUTTON'S PAPER THAT AGAIN MANY OFFERS ON THAT AND LOTS OF CONTRIBUTORS INCLUDING FORMER SCIENCE FELLOW OF MINE DI&lt;c.cyan&gt; A LAND. VERY PROUD OF-&lt;/c&gt; WE LOOKED AT THIS BECAUSE- IT SHOWED HOW IN AN URBAN AREA YOU COULD GET POLLUTION INTO WATER- SINCE THERE ISN'T A COMPARABLE STUDY INTO WHAT GETS INTO THE SAN JOAQUIN OR THE SACRAMENTO RIVER. I REALLY HAD TO RELY ON THIS WHICH I THINK IS JUST AN INDICATION I MEAN WE OFFER HAD TIRES. AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I ALWAYS SORT OF NEVER CARED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WAS MY- TIRES WHERE GAP. NOW I KNOW IT HAPPENS IT GETS CAUGHT UP IN STORM WATER GOES INTO THE- INTO THE LAKES AND RIVERS AND BAYS OF- CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S SOMETHING PARTICULARLY NOW THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED A TOXIC SUBSTANCE. I JUST CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW THERE AND- THEN THIS WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE BY THE ESTUARY INSTITUTED. REALLY REVEALED A LOT- YES CENTER BALANCE. YEAH I MEAN ON THAT NOTE AND THERE'S ALSO AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM ASSOCIATE WHICH I GUESS IS NOT TECHNICALLY A MICROPLASTIC BY ZINC. IS AN IMPORTANT INGREDIENT IN TIRES AND IT'S ACTUALLY CAUSING ENORMOUS. CLEAN WATER ACT LIABILITY CHALLENGES FOR A LOT OF OUR CITIES I KNOW I'VE GOT TO SIT IN MY DISTRICT FOR EXAMPLE IT'S GOT. YOU KNOW TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL BUDGET THE TUNER FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR LIABILITY OF THE CLEAN WATER ACT AND SOME OF IT LOOKS OF SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THAT. HAS TO DO WITH ZINC I RUNOFF. AND YOU KNOW WE'VE WE SPELL TIME LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE. I'M TRYING TO SEE THIS AND SOLICIT A FIX I THINK THAT THE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT. FOLKS IN THE IN THE- TIRE INDUSTRY RUBBER INDUSTRY IT'S A TRIBE AND COME BACK TO US AND SAID THERE'S NO VIABLE ALTERNATIVES- TO TAKE CARE OF WHAT THINK TAKES CARE OF IN TERMS OF THE FUNCTIONALITY OF A TIRE- BUT- I WOULD. I GUESS I'D LOVE TO. THAT MAY POSE THE QUESTION THE PAST MAYBE THE SECOND ONE BUT BUT- I THINK ALL THE PARENTS COULD PROBABLY SPEAK THIS I'D LOVE TO. DIGITAL DEEPER ON ON. OUR END- ANTI POLLUTION IN WHAT SORT OF WHAT INFORMATION YOU'VE GOTTEN FROM OTHER. JURISDICTIONS WITH REGARDS TO- PREVENTING TIRE RELATED POLLUTION WHETHER BE ON THE ON THE MICROPLASTIC SIDE OR IN THE SINK SIDE. ARE THERE ANY BEST PRACTICES OUT THERE- IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY THAT WE OUGHT TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. AS ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS PARTICULAR PART OF THE PROBLEM. DR KAUFMAN PERHAPS YOU COULD- GO INTO THAT. BOB OBSOLETE AND THIS ONE TO DOCTOR SUTTON ACTUALLY DO A BETTER JOB. DR SUTTON. SURE SO WHAT I AM VERY EXCITED TO SEE WHAT COMES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROLS SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS EFFORT WHEN IT COMES TO TIRES BECAUSE THAT IS ACTUALLY PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON ZINC AND THIS NEWARK MORE NEWLY IDENTIFIED PRESERVATIVES IT'S TOXIC TO THE COLORADO IT IT'S A NEWER ISSUES SO THEY'RE GONNA HOPEFULLY EXAMINE BOTH OF THESE TOXIC INGREDIENTS IN TIRES. AND SEE IF THERE ARE WAYS TO REFORMULATE ARTIST THIS IS A SORT OF IT THE PROCESS ISN'T AN ONGOING CONVERSATION WITH MANUFACTURERS WHERE. THE AGENCY CHALLENGES THEM TO DETERMINE. WHETHER THERE MAY BE SAFER ALTERNATIVES- BUT DO YOU KNOW OF I PROJECT- PLAN I HAD AND BETTER CARE WHAT I DO I FORGOT TO MENTION TO ME I DO APPRECIATE THE CHAIRS INVITATION- AS- TO THIS IS VERY INTERESTING HEARING- DID YOU KNOW OF. OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY OF THE WORLD THAT HAVE. BEEN DOING BETTER WORK IN THIS AREA THAT WE OUT OF LEARN FROM MORE KNOW ABOUT. WELL THAT THE RESEARCH TEAM THAT WORKED ON THIS- PRESERVATIVE CHEMICALS BASED IN WASHINGTON STATE AND THAT THEY'VE BEEN EXAMINING TIRES LARGELY BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF RESTORATION TO BRING CALL CALL BACK TO THE STREAMS AND IN SOME CASES THE STREAMS. HAVE NOT BEEN HOSPITABLE THERE'S BEEN THIS REALLY ACUTE TOXIC REACTION AFTER STORM EVENTS THAT'S BECAUSE THE CO HOSTED TO DIE WITHIN HOURS OF TIME EXPOSURE TO THIS ASSET TO STORMWATER RUNOFF FROM ST LARGE HIGHWAYS AND MAJOR ROADWAYS. SO I WOULD SAY FOR THE CONSULTATION WITH THAT FOLKS IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON MIGHT BE. GOOD WEIGHT AND SAID GET MORE CONVERSATION ABOUT BEST PRACTICES MOVING FORWARD OKAY SO YOU'RE SAYING THERE THEY'VE COME UP WITH SOME SORT OF PRESERVATIVE CHEMICAL THAT MIMICS THE BENEFITS BENEFITS OF ZINC. THAT IS POTENTIALLY A BETTER ALTERNATIVE IS THAT JUST YOU KNOW IT UNFORTUNATELY IT DOESN'T MIMIC THE BENEFIT IT'S AN ADDITIONAL PROBLEM SO I THINK THE PROBLEM AND THEN ALSO THIS PRESERVATIVE IS A NEW PROBLEM THAT YOU JUST IDENTIFIED. SO NOW WE'RE NOW WILL GET BACK TO PROBLEMS. OKAY SO WE DON'T. SO. SO THERE ISN'T EFFECTIVE ANYTHING IT JUST. I WAS HOPING FOR SOME HELP BUT I GUESS YEARS YEAH YOU GIVE ME LESS HOPE. WITH YOUR ANSWER BUT IT'S- PROBABLY. I CAN'T SAY IT SO SEEMS ESPECIALLY WHERE INSTITUTE I WAS INVOLVED WITH THIS WITH ONE STUDY THAT IS A BIT HOPEFUL IN TERMS OF. EXAMINING GREEN STORMWATER INFRASTRUCTURE OR A RAIN GARDEN AND I THINK ONE OF THE LATER SPEAKERS WILL TALK ABOUT THIS MORE. FULLY BUT I BASICALLY IF YOU PASSED IF YOU PASSED ON WATER THROUGH A RAIN GARDEN. THEN I DON'T THAT CAN FILTER OUT SOME OF THE PARTICLES RIGHT. RIGHT SO WE DIDN'T ONE SMALL STUDY IN A RAIN GARDEN IN THE BAY AREA AND WE ARE ABOUT TO START CONNECTING MORE ROBUST STUDY IN THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. SO THIS IS ONE KIND OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE THAT COULD BE USEFUL FOR. BOTH PARTICLES AND THE CHEMICALS ASSOCIATED. WITH THESE PARTICLES BUT THAT. SCIENCE IS STILL. SO I DON'T WANT TO. EXAGGERATE THE EFFICACY OF THIS AFTER AT THIS TIME IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT- MISTER MORNING FOR STRUCTURE IS IT CAN BE QUITE COSTLY SO IT CAN BE MORE EFFECTIVE IF WE CAN. ADDRESS THESE CONTAMINANTS AT THE SOURCE YOU KNOW REDUCE USE REFORMULATION OR RATHER THAN CATCHING THEM FURTHER DOWNSTREAM WELL LET ME ASK ALL THE PANELISTS THAT YOU'RE JUST AS I THINK YOU HIT ON THE ISSUE RIGHT A MANY SO WHAT HOW HOW MUCH PROGRESS WE MAKING ON REALLY IDENTIFYING THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTORS. I WE DO WE JUST TALK ABOUT TIRES YOU KNOW PRESUMABLY CLOSE PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE LEAST A LOT OF THE MICROFIBERS THAT WERE MENTIONED. AB YOU KNOW SO CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE EFFORTS UNDER WAY TO REALLY HELP US UNDERSTAND WHERE. THE PROBLEM IS ON THE SOURCE SIDE. AND THEN ONCE AGAIN I YOU KNOW. IS THERE ANY GOOD EXAMPLES OUT THERE AND IN OTHER PLACES- OF FOLKS WHO HAVE FIGURED OUT A GOOD WAY OF ADDRESSING THIS I MEAN IS THERE. AND NO. WAY TO ATTEMPT TO TRY TO PUSH MANUFACTURERS TO BE MORE RESPONSIBLE YOU KNOW TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE- FOR ACOSTA THEIR ULTIMATELY- PUSHING OFF ON TO THE ON TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. I'M TO SPEAK BRIEFLY I DON'T WANT TO TAKE. TAKE TIME FROM MY CO PRESENTERS BUT- I THINK THE FACT IT. FOR EXAMPLE DOCTOR KAUFMAN'S WORK ON A DEFINITION AND ON MESSAGE IS LEADING ACTUALLY THE WHOLE WORLD IN SOME WAYS THAT. THAT CALIFORNIA'S REALLY OUT IN FRONT ON THIS ISSUE. SO AT. THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO BE LEADERS I SUPPOSE I. ON THIS ON. INTERESTING MICROPLASTICS. THANK YOU SENATOR- AND I ALSO HAVE A QUESTION FOR- DOCTOR SUTTON- SO IS THERE ANY INDICATION OF. PLASTICS COMING FROM OUR LANDFILLS I KNOW THAT- IN THE SOUTH PART OF ALAMEDA COUNTY YOU DO HAVE A LANDFILL RIGHT NEXT TO THE BAG. ANY INDICATION THAT WE GET LEAKAGE FROM THE LANDFILLS INTO THE DAY IN TERMS OF PLASTICS. I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC SCIENCE ON THAT I DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE STUDIES. ELSEWHERE THAT HAVE OBSERVE MICRO PLASTICS IN LANDFILL LEACHATE. I BELIEVE LEACHATE. IS TREAT IT DOESN'T IS NOT SUPPOSED TO. EXIT POLLING AND FEELING GOING TO THE BANK- PERHAPS OTHERS. MORE ON THIS OR FROM IF THE REGULATIONS ARE WORKING THERE G. R. PLASTICS COMING FROM THE LANDFILL SO THESE PRESUMABLY THAT AND- WHAT'S GETTING IN THE PLASTICS THE SOURCES FIRST OF ALL TIRES. THE LEAST IN THE BAY AREA THAT WAS THE BIGGEST CONTRIBUTOR. AND THEN PROBABLY LATER ILLEGAL DUMPING- WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY CAN RELATED TO THE QUESTION SEVERAL RALLY BROUGHT UP. WHAT IS IT WE NEED TO CONTROL TO KEEP OUR STORMWATER- MORE FEWER OTHER THAN THE TIRES. SH WELL THE OTHER THING BESIDES TIRES IN OUR STORM WATER WERE FIBERS IN SO SOME OF THOSE FARMERS COULD BE DERIVED FROM OUR CLOTHING. AND ONE PATHWAY FOR THEM TO GET OUT INTO THE LANDSCAPE COULD BE FOR EXAMPLE OUR DRYER VENTS. AND ANOTHER TYPE OF FIBER WE SAW OUR THAT THE ONES ASSOCIATED WITH CIGARETTES SO THAT CELLULOSE ACETATE. SO THAT COULD BE ANOTHER TYPE OF SPECIFIC SOURCE THAT THAT ONE COULD ADDRESS AT IN TERMS OF REDUCING STORMWATER YES MA'AM. I LIKE THE IDEA BUT- YEAH I BELIEVE IT WAS ONE OF THE TOPICS OF THE OPC THEIR THEIR DRAFT TOP TEN LIST OF WAYS TO ADDRESS. COULD YOU GET THAT REPORT TO- ARE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE THE DRAFT REPORT TO OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS AS WELL AS- SENATORS ALLEN AND STERN AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER. LUIS RIVAS. SO OKAY- I THINK IN THE- I THINK WE CAN NOW GO ON TO THE NEXT PANEL. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH- THIS IS TRULY BEYOND- FOR ME- WILL HAVE A LIFE CHANGING. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT. RESEARCHERS ABOUT WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THE IMPACT MIKE CARTER FROM THE ENVIRONMENT INCLUDING AQUATIC LIFE FROM ECOSYSTEMS AND HOW MIGHT THEY CURRENTLY BEING DIRECTLY. INTERFERING WITH HUMAN HEALTH- I'VE HEARD RIGHT- GRANT S. BRONTE PROFESSOR IN THE STATE UNIVERSITY- TO DISCUSS YOUR GROUND BREAKING RESEARCH ON THE ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION OF MICROPLASTIC IN REMOTE AREAS UNITED STATES. AGAIN IF YOU CAN YOUR QUESTIONS TO REMEMBER PANELS AND- YOU FIVE TO SEVEN MINUTES FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH DR QUIRK AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME TO BE A PART OF THIS IMPORTANT PANEL REALLY EXCITED TO BE HERE. SO I'D LIKE TO START OFF BY- ACKNOWLEDGING THAT LESS THAN A DOZEN PAPERS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED ON THIS TOPIC IN THE LAST FEW YEARS SO WE'RE REALLY AT THE VERY START OF UNDERSTANDING HOW PLASTICS ARE EMITTED TO THE ATMOSPHERE AND TRANSPORTED TO THE ATMOSPHERE. WE ALSO DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON NATIONAL PLASTICS SO WHEN I SAY NANO PLASTICS I'M TALKING ABOUT PARTICLES THAT ARE SMALLER THAN ONE MICROMETER AND FOR REFERENCE A RED BLOOD CELL SALAS ABOUT TEN MICROMETERS THESE ARE VERY VERY SMALL PARTICLES AND THEY WOULD HAVE DIFFERENT EMISSION POINTS. AND TRANSPORT PATHWAYS AND MICROPLASTICS. I'M GONNA STICK TO MICROPLASTICS HERE. SO WHAT DO WE KNO ABOUT HOW MICROPLASTICS ENTERING THE ATMOSPHERE AS WE'VE HEARD. PLASTICS ARE VERY PERSISTENT SO THEY IN THE ENVIRONMENT THEY WILL RESIST ALL FORMS OF NATURAL TO KAY. INSTEAD BREAKING APART INTO SMALLER AND SMALLER PARTICLES UNTIL FINALLY THEY'RE SMALL ENOUGH TO BE TRANSPORTED BY THE WIND. SO SIMILAR TO SOIL DUST MICROPLASTICS NEED TO BE ADMITTED TO THE ATMOSPHERE THROUGH SOME. PHYSICAL MECHANICAL PROCESS. UNLIKE SOIL DUST HOWEVER MICROPLASTICS ARE A LOT LESS DANCE SO THAT MEANS THAT THEY CAN TRAVEL MUCH FARTHER IN A MUCH LARGER SIZES. BUT WE CAN USE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW SOIL DUST IS EMITTED TO THE ATMOSPHERE AND OTHER AEROSOLES TO CREATE HYPOTHESES ON HOW MICROPLASTICS MIGHT BE ENTERING THE ATMOSPHERE. SO VERY LIKELY SOURCE ARE IS THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF PLASTICS IN THE OCEAN STATE TAX THERE ARE OFTEN LESS DENSE THAN WATER. STILL BUBBLE BURST ACTION AND WAVE ACTION COULD BE AT I WANTED MECHANISM THAT MICROPLASTICS ARE BEING ADMITTED. TO THE ATMOSPHERE. ANOTHER LIKELY MAJOR SOURCES ROADS THE ROADS ARE LONG AND WHEN YOU'RE IN THAT PROVIDES AN UNOBSTRUCTED PATH FOR A WIN. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY ROADS AT CARS DRIVING ON THE ROADS PROVIDES MECHANICAL ENERGY TO A MINUTE PARTICLES HIGH INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. THIS ISN'T JUST THE TIRE WEAR PARTICLES IN THE ROBERT PARTICLES WHICH ARE PART OF THIS BUT ALSO ANY MICROPLASTIC FROM A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT COMMODITIES THAT COULD BE IN THAT ROAD TAX. AS WE'VE HEARD AGRICULTURE COULD BE A REALLY IMPORTANT SOURCE TO THE ATMOSPHERE NOT JUST FROM BIOSOLIDS APPLICATION BUT ALSO FROM PLASTIC MOLDS AND PLASTIC. TARPS THAT ARE ADDED TO AND USED IN THE AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES- AND STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT CLASSICS ARE PREFERENTIALLY WINNOWED FROM THE SOILS AS COMPARED TO SWELLED PAST. AB POPULATION IS A LITTLE BIT OF A STRANGE TERM BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT HOW PEOPLE ARE REALLY EFFECTIVE AT MOVING STAND AWAY FROM THE BEACH HUMANS ARE ALSO LIKELY REALLY EFFECTIVE AT REMOVING MICROPLASTICS AWAY FROM SEATS. SO ANY AREAS ON THE EARTH THAT PRODUCED A LOT OF DUST THAT HAPPENED TO BE NEAR. LARGE URBAN CENTERS HAVE THE CAPACITY TO MOVE PLASTICS INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. AND THEN ONCE WE HAVE CITIES AND CITIES IS WHERE A LOT OF OUR PLASTIC WASTE IS GENERATED. BUT IT MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE WHERE PLASTICS ARE EMITTED TO THE ATMOSPHERE SECURING DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN SOURCES TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND SOURCES TO THE ATMOSPHERE. SO WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT DUST IF FOR EXAMPLE IS THAT CITIES PRODUCE A LOT OF DOT OFTEN EIGHT AND AT IN ORDER TO. MANAGE YOU TO ORDER OF MAGNITUDE MORE THAN CHASING RURAL OR REMOTE LOCATIONS. THIS IS BECAUSE THESE ARE PRODUCING A LOT OF DUST BUT IT'S NOT MOVING HIGH INTO THE ATMOSPHERE SO. IT'S NOT GETTING TRANSPORTED VERY FAR. SO IN TERMS OF HOW MICROPLASTICS IS TRANSPORTED THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE WHERE IT IS IN THE ATMOSPHERE HOW FAR IS TRACK IT'S BEING TRANSPORTED- WE'RE REALLY JUST STARTING TO SCRATCH THE SURFACE THAT THAT QUESTION AS WELL AS IF YOU'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE STUDY- THAT I CONDUCTED. AND I WAS REALLY ONLY ABLE TO START ADDRESSING THESE QUESTIONS BECAUSE I CAPITALIZE ON AN EXISTING NETWORK. I DEVELOPED A SAMPLER THAT COULD WORK WITH THE NATIONAL ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION PROGRAM THAT ALLOWED ME TO SAMPLE. BOTH WHITES AND DRY DEPOSITION SO WHAT IS WHAT FALLS OUT WITH THE BRAIN. AND DRIES WHAT FALLS OUT UNDER DRY CONDITIONS AND I WAS ABLE TO DO THIS AND- REALLY- HIGH TEMPORAL RESOLUTION WEEKLY FOR RAIN. IF IT RAINS AND LUCKY FOR DRY. AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT WHITE DEPOSITION WAS REALLY DIFFERENT AND DRY. SO WHAT THE POSITION TENDED TO BE SOURCED FOR MORE NEARBY LOCATIONS SO IF IT AIR MASS PASSED THROUGH IT AND URBAN CENTER WE SAW MORE PLASTIC OR IF IT HAD A LOT OF. SOIL DUST IN IT. AND WHAT WE THINK IS HAPPENING HERE IS THAT AS STOREFRONTS MOVE THROUGH AN AREA THEY GENERATE A LOT OF PLANS AND A LOT OF ENERGY THAT CAN. PICK UP A LOT OF TACTICS OFF THE GROUND WHICH CAN THEN BE. RAINED OUT IN THAT STORE. AND SOON I KNOW I JUST SAID THAT WE DON'T THINK CITIES ARE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR. SO I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT- CITIES. ALSO HAVE A LOT OF ROAD NETWORK NETWORKS COMING IN AND OUT OF THAT. BUT ALSO WE WERE ONLY ABLE TO ASCRIBE ABOUT 10% OF OUR DEPOSITION TO CITIES AND THIS IS BECAUSE 80% OF OUR DEPOSITION CAME OUT. AS DRY DEPOSITION. SO DRIED UP AS- OUT. VERY DE. IT WAS MUCH SMALLER IN SIZE. IT WAS INVERSELY RELATED TO SOIL DUST SO THE LAST OIL DESK THAT WAS IN OUR SAMPLE SOME MORE PLASTICS THE STOCK. AND WE ALSO SAW A STRONG RELATIONSHIP TO ELEVATION SO THE HIGHER OUR SAMPLE SITES WHERE THE MORE CLASS THAT WE SAW. AND THEN FINALLY- ARE THE PLASTIC DEPOSITION RATE. WAYS WAS CORRELATED TO THESE BROAD CLIMATE SCALE PATTERNS LIKE THE LOCATION OF THE JET ST. SO IF THE JET STREAM. REALLY FAR SOUTH. AND INTERSECTED WITH THEIR SITES AS IS IN THIS IMAGE HERE WE SAW MORE PLASTIC. AND SO WHAT THIS IS TELLING US IS THAT PLASTICS ARE MOVING AROUND HIGH IN THE IN THE ATMOSPHERE COLUMN. AND THEY'RE INFLUENCED BY THESE BROAD SCALE PATTERNS MEANING THAT. THEY'RE BEING TRANSPORTED VERY FAR. SO TERMS OF TIME DEBRIS. RATES AGAIN WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF DATA AS TO WHAT'S BEEN PUBLISHED AS SHOWN HERE. AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS THAT THE DEPOSITION RATES WITHIN URBAN CENTRES ARE ONLY SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN WHAT WE'VE QUANTIFIED IN REMOTE LOCATIONS. AND SO THIS IS A LITTLE BIT CONCERNING BECAUSE IT SUGGESTS TO US THAT A LOT OF THE ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION OF PLASTICS IS DERIVED FROM LEGACY POLLUTION. SO IF WE DID A LITTLE BIT DEEPER INTO WHAT WE ACTUALLY FOUND IT WITHIN OUR SAMPLES. ROUGHLY 226% OF THE SAMPLES WE ANALYZED WERE COMPOSED OF PLASTIC I'M JUST INCLUDED DOMINANTLY FIBERS BUT ALSO- MICROBEADS AS WELL A A VARIETY OF OTHER DIFFERENT- TYPES OF PLASTIC LAKE ROAD TIGHT. IT MIGHT SOUND LIKE A SMALL NUMBER 226% BUT IN FACT THIS IS A VERY LARGE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL. LOOKING AT OUR DEPOSITION RATES ACROSS THE AMERICAN WEST WE SAW BETWEEN FORTY EIGHT AND FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE. PIECES OF PLASTIC BEING DEPOSITED EVERY METER SQUARE EVERY SINGLE DAY. SO WE'VE WE SCALE THIS UP TO THE SIZE OF THE PROTECTED AREAS WE WERE STUDYING THIS TRANSLATED TO POINT YOU TO TWELVE TONS OF PLASTIC PER YEAR WITHIN THE SITES. AND THEN IF WE CONSIDER THE- PROTECTED AREAS IN ELEVEN WESTERN STATES THAT THIS IS A DARK GREEN AND LIGHT GREEN AREAS WE ESTIMATED THAT BETWEEN A THOUSAND AND FOUR THOUSAND TONS ARE BEING DEPOSITED EVERY SINGLE YEAR. SO AGAIN I WOULD LIKE TO INTEGRATE THAT WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MANTA PLASTICS AT THIS POINT SO THERE'S STILL A LOT OF QUESTIONS. I'M A LOT MORE QUESTIONS AND WE HAVE ANSWERS TO- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND I'LL ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE PEOPLE. OKAY ALL RIGHT THANKS VERY MUCH- IT'S HARD TO SEE WHAT KIND OF SOLUTION WE CAN HAVE TO THIS OTHER THAN BANNING PLASTICS BUT WE'LL GET INTO THAT LATER- SO THE NEXT SPEAKER IS. PART OF OUR INTERNATIONAL- DAY TODAY- DR CHELSEA ROCKMAN FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO TO EXPLAIN MICROPLASTIC PATHWAYS IN AQUATIC ECO SYSTEMS AND KNOWN IMPACTS TO MARINE LIFE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YEAH. OKAY WONDERFUL WELL THANK YOU DR CHAIRMAN AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M I'M THRILLED TO BE HERE TODAY YES I'M IN IN CANADA BUT I SPEND A LOT OF YEARS AND I CALIFORNIA. AND THE NAME IS DR CHELSEA ROCK MAN I'M A PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO AND I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE ISSUE OF PLASTIC POLLUTION FOR MORE THAN A DECADE- WHICH INCLUDES MANY YEARS I'M IN CALIFORNIA AND I CONTINUE TO WORK. IN CALIFORNIA TODAY. AND YES IF YOU'RE WEATHER. SO I'M GONNA TALK TODAY ABOUT THE WAYS IN WHICH MICROPLASTICS CAN IMPACT. OTHER SPEAKERS THAT CONTAMINATION IS WIDESPREAD. THIS IS NO LONGER A QUESTION THAT WE'RE GRAPPLING WITH IN THE FIELD. AND WE'RE STARTING TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WIDESPREAD CONTAMINATION HAS LED TO CONTAMINATION AT EVERY LEVEL OF THE FOOD CHAIN THIS INCLUDES IN PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY WITH PLANTS- WE HAVE CONTAMINATION. AS WELL ALL THE WAY UP TO APEX PREDATORS LIKE SHARKS. SOMETIMES THE CONTAMINATION IS QUITE STRIKINGLY LARGE SO I WE HAVE FOUND NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN PARTICLES IN ONE BROWN BOWL HAD FISH HERE IN THE TORONTO AREA IN LAKE ONTARIO. AND DR THOMAS MAYES REPORTED ALMOST FOUR THOUSAND PARTICLES IN A SPECIES OF SHARK. SO WE KNOW THE CONTAMINATION IS OCCURRING AND WE'RE EVEN STARTING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE CLASSIC MOVE AROUND A FOOD WET WHEN THEY CONTAMINATE- ORGANISMS IN IN. THE ENVIRONMENT WE KNOW THAT THESE ARE THESE PLASTICS CAN BE INGESTED WE'RE ALSO STARTING TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY CAN BE INHALED THIS WOULD BE THROUGH THE GILLS OF FISH. WE CAN TALK ABOUT HUMAN HEALTH LATER- ANSWER STAFF STUFF RIGHT WILL DO THAT- WE KNOW THAT IT CAN BE IT CAN BE YOU JUST AND THERE CAN BE EXCRETION. I PLASTIC CAN TRANSFER FROM A PARADE TO A PREDATOR THROUGH TRAFFIC TRANSFERRED. BUT WE'RE ASKING ABOUT NOW IS TRYING INTEREST THAT. INCREASE OVER TIME IN CONCENTRATION OUTSIDE OF THE GUY IN THE TISSUES. AND DOESN'T INCREASE THE FOOD. I CONCENTRATION WAVER SYSTEM LIKE POLLUTANTS DEAL. THIS IS STILL QUESTION WE AREN'T SURE ACTUALLY I'M NOT SURE I THINK MY HYPOTHESIS WOULD BE THAT IT DOESN'T INCREASE. IN CONCENTRATION OF THE FOOD WEB. BUT WE KNOW THEY CAN'T CONCENTRATE OUTSIDE THE CAT AND THERE'S EVIDENCE OF CLASSIC IN THE FLAT IN THE LIVERS OF FISH TISSUE. AND FOR A WHILE THIS WAS HARD TO BELIEVE- BUT WE'VE EVEN FOUND IN FISH THAT WE'VE SAMPLED IN OUR OWN LAB SO THE ONLY THING I WANT YOU TO NOTICE FROM THIS GRAPH. IS THAT THE ORANGE IN THE PURPLE BOXES- THOSE BOX PLOTS ARE EVIDENCE OF MICROPLASTICS IN THE FILLET AND IN THE LIVER OF SPORT FISH TAKEN FROM LAKE SIMCOE. AT HERE IN ONTARIO AND THE GREEN IS THE MICROPLASTIC IN THE GOT YOU CAN SEE THAT OF COURSE THE MICROPLASTIC IN THE GUT WAS MORE ABUNDANT. BUT THAT WE WERE SEEING. THIS EVIDENCE IN THE FLAG. AND IN THE LIVER WHICH WAS QUITE. SO THIS LEADS TO THE- WHAT ARE THE IMPACT. HOW DOES THAT IN IN- AFFECT WILDLIFE. WHEN IT ENDS IN THE IN. AND THERE'S THREE SORT OF OVER ARCHING MECHANISMS I WILL SPEAK UP. AND ONE IS PHYSICAL WHEN A MICROPLASTIC LEADS THE GUY THAT GOES INTO AN ORGAN GOES INTO A TISSUE. IT CAN BE A SOURCE OF INFORMATION WHICH COULD EVENTUALLY INTENTIONALLY LEAD TO TUMOR FORMATION. ALSO WE'VE SEEN IN FISH THAT ARE EXPOSED TO MICROPLASTICS IN A TANK IN THE LAB. BECAUSE THEY START EATING LESS OF THEIR FOOD AND THEY START EATING MORE OF THE PLASTIC THAT PHYSICAL PRESENCE OF PLASTIC IN THE WATER CAN CAUSE A THREE DAY MISSION A FACT. WHICH CAN LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN MORTALITY OR DEATH. YOU CAN ALSO HAVE A CHEMICAL BACK DR SUTTON WAS TALKING ABOUT THIS WITH THE CHEMICALS AND TIRED ASKED. WE SEE THAT FATHEAD MINNOW A CRAYFISH LOSE THAT PIGMENTATION IN THEIR EYES. WHEN THEY'RE EXPOSED TO THE LEACHATE FROM TIRED TASK WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS IMPACTS THEM AS THEY AS THEY GET OLDER. AND SAYS POTENTIALLY A SIMILAR STORY TO THE SALMON. THERE'S ALSO EVIDENCE THAT WHEN PEOPLE EXPOSE MICROPLASTICS ORGANISMS IN THE LABS THAT ITS THE ADDITIVES THAT ARE CAUSING THE TOXICITY THIS IS A- CASE WITHOUT C. ELEGANS AS A WORD IN SO I'LL- MAKER. ALSO THE IN BY AND OF TRANSFORM INTO THESE MULTIPLE STRESSORS WHERE THEY START TO ACCUMULATE THE METALS AND THE PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS FROM THE WATER COLIN. THEY MIGHT EVEN GAIN A MICROBIAL COMMUNITY THAT MIGHT INCLUDE DISEASE OR PARASITES. WHEN YOUR CLASSIC IS THEN EATEN THE QUESTION IS HOW DOES THAT MIXTURE OF THE PLASTIC IN THE CHEMICALS IMPACT THE ORGANISMS. HERE I'M SHOWING YOU WORK ACTUALLY FROM CALIFORNIA DURING MY PHD I. PUT PLASTIC M. CONTAINED IN THE SAN DIEGO BAY ALLOWED IT TO ACCUMULATE CONTAMINANTS EXPOSED FISH AND I FOUND THAT THE PLASTIC- IN THE PLASTIC THAT WAS PUT IN THE SAN DIEGO BAY WAS MORE TOXIC THAN THE PLASTIC THAT WAS NOT. YOU'RE IN SHOWING YOU A TUMOR IN THE LIVER OF A FISH THAT WAS EXPOSED TO THAT MICROPLASTIC FROM THE BANK. WHEREAS FISH THAT WERE EXPOSED TO THE CLEAN PLASTIC STILL HAD WEIRD LESIONS IN THE LIVER BUT THEY WEREN'T AS FAR AS TUMOR PROMOTION. AND MY PHD STUDENT KENNEDY BUT SHE HAS ALSO FOUND THAT MICROPLASTICS FROM LAKE ONTARIO CAUSES MORE DEFORMITIES IN FISH THAN PLASTIC. TAKEN OFF THE SHELF. THESE ARE JUST KIND OF WANNA STUDY THAT I'M YOU ALSO TO TALK YOU ABOUT A THEN I. THAT I'VE DONE. THIS MEANS I LOOK ACROSS LITERATURE THAT HAS JUST REALLY EXPANDED OVER THE YEARS AND TRY TO WRITE PAPERS THAT STAND THE SIDE ALL OF THAT LITERATURE TO SAY. WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF MICROPLASTICS SO I'M GONNA TRY TO GO QUICKLY THROUGH SOME OF THOSE RESULTS AND THEN I WOULD LOVE TO ANSWER MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT IT LATER. SO WHAT WE DO IS WE LOOK THROUGH THE LITERATURE. AND WE CHECKED THE BOX FOR THE SIZE OF PLASTIC FROM THAT NANO SCALE THAT WAS DISCUSSED EARLIER IT TOO BIG FISHING NETS. AND WE LOOK ACROSS LEVELS OF BIOLOGICAL ORGANISATION I WANT YOU TO NOTICE HERE IS THESE ARE SUB ORGANISMAL SOMETHING PHYSIOLOGICALLY IN THE BODY HERE THIS WOULD BE DEATH TO AN ORGANISM CHANGING THE SIZE OF THE POPULATION OR THE CHANGE IN THE COMMUNITY. THE DARKER THE SHADING THE MORE EVIDENCE OF DEMONSTRATED IMPACT THEIR ART TO THAT SIZE OF PLASTIC AND TO THAT LEVEL OF BIOLOGICAL ORGANIZATIONS FOR THE MICROPLASTICS HERE YOU SEE BLUE. AT ALMOST EVERY LEVEL. INCLUDING UP TO THOSE ONES THAT ARE MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY EAGLE ARE SORRY ECOLOGICALLY RELEVANT SO WE KNOW THAT MICROPLASTICS. CAN IMPACT. IN THE MALLS ACROSS MANY LEVELS OF BIOLOGICAL ORGANIZATIONS AND ACROSS MANY SIZES AND THIS EVIDENCE HAS BEEN INCREASING OVER THE YEARS THIS IS THE SECOND. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META ANALYSIS I'VE WORKED ON. WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING. IS THAT WE ALSO SEE STUDIES THAT TRYING TO QUANTIFY THE EFFECTS OF MICROPLASTICS IN THE LAB AND THEY DON'T DETECT IN EFFECT SO THAT THEY DON'T THIS DOESN'T ALWAYS OCCUR SO THE QUESTION IS WHY I WILL MAKE A POSITIVE THEIR COMPLEXES DR KAUFMAN POINTED OUT. THE CONCENTRATION MATTERS THIS SIZE MATTERS THE SHAPE MATTERS THE TYPE OF PLASTIC WE TALKED ABOUT TIRES. AND THE TAX THAT IN MY LAST THIRTY SECONDS I THINK I MIGHT BE OVER I JUST WANT TO SHOW TO YOU WHEN WE TRY TO COLLAPSE ALL OF THE. VARIABILITY OF THE PLASTIC TOGETHER AND TRY TO DO A RISKY. THE SAME CON. OF MY GROUP. NOW SOME REAL GREAT WORK THAT BEEN LET BY DOC ALBERT COLEMAN IN THE MATTER. HAS FOUND. NUMBERS THAT THEY- MIGHT CAUSE A THE FACT ANYWAY FROM A- TO FIVE TWENTY ONE PARTICLES FRESH WATER. IN EIGHT TO FOURTEEN HUNDRED AND NINETY IN MARINE THOSE ARE HIGH CONCENTRATIONS WE FOUND CONCENTRATIONS WITHIN THAT RANGE AND STORM WATER IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY FOR EXAMPLE. THE DOCTOR BECKY SAT AND TALKED ABOUT- SO THESE CONCENTRATIONS ARE ARE NOT ON HER DEATH. AND THAT SUGGEST THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD START MITIGATING- I'M- HERE IN CALIFORNIA OF COURSE THE SQUARED WORKING GROUP THAT I'M INVOLVED IN IS GOING TO COME OUT WITH NUMBERS MORE SPECIFIC TO CALIFORNIA BY WORKING ON A RISK ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK. AND THE O. S. D. REPORT SHOULD COME OUT AND THIS MONTH. AND THAT WILL TALK ABOUT PRIORITIES FOR MEASURING CONCENTRATIONS IN NATURE SO WE CAN COMPARE EXPOSURE TO REST. AND I'M SORRY WENT OVER BUT I REALLY. APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU. I BELIEVE EVERY WAS ABOUT. I YOU'RE ONLY ONE OVER BY SO. OKAY WHEN- AND IT'S SO THAT THAT WE REALLY APPRECIATE AND WE THANK YOU ALL AS WELL AS ALL OUR OTHER PEOPLE FOR TAKING THIS TIME- GOING ON IN OUR INTERNATIONAL FLAVOR HERE WE'RE GOING TO TALK WITH DOCTOR STEPH STEPHANIE RIGHT FROM IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON. AND SHE'S GOING TO SHARE WITH US YOUR UNDERSTANDING MICROPLASTICS PATHWAYS TO HUMANS BY A DRINKING WATER AND ALSO SEWAGE SLUDGE APPLICATIONS IN AN ELATION. AND EVEN DETECTIONS IN HUMAN PLACENTAS AND THIS WHOLE QUESTION OF SEWAGE SLUDGE WHEN I FIRST SAW. THE ESTUARY INSTITUTE SAID ALMOST NONE OF THE PLASTICS THAT GET INTO THE BARRIER ONE THIRD OF 1% COME FROM. SEWAGE I STOPPED WORRYING ABOUT- SEWAGE TREATMENT I STOP WORRYING ABOUT IT AND THEN SOMEBODY POINTED OUT TO ME PADDED ENDS UP IN THE SLUDGE WHOOPS. SO WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM DR RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH HATE FOR THE YOU CAN ALL SEE MY SLIDE DECK HEY AND YOU CAN HEAR ME I QUE ADEM I'M GONNA TRY AND KEEP THE WEIGHT BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT ELEVEN PM EST FOR HABITS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME AB SITE BE MAKING ON THE TOPIC OF MICROPLASTICS FOR ABOUT. CLOSE TO TEN IS NOT TODAY- OF THE LAST FIVE YEARS I'VE BEEN FOCUSING MY RESEARCH ON HUMAN EXPOSURE I AM ON THE FACTS AND PARTICULARLY FIVE YEAH. I'M SORRY. TO BEGIN WITH- WE'VE JUST HEARD FROM DR BRYONY ABOUT- THE FACT THAT MICROPLASTIC IS IN NEED OF RECOGNIZED ATHLETES IN. AND SO YOU OF COURSE THAT RAISES ALARM BELLS THAT WE MIGHT BE EXPOSED TO THIS BECAUSE WE BREED THAT. AND BUT I JUST WANT TO STRESS THIS DOUBLE THE IMPORTANCE OF. A DYNAMIC SITES WHEN IT COMES TO HUMAN EXPOSURE. NOW THIS IS TODAY BUT SIDE BECAUSE IT. DEMETRIC SIZE SHAPE AND MATERIAL DENSITY INTO THIS MEASURE AND IT REALLY MATCHES- INDICATES HOW THESE PARTICLES BEHAVE AND ACT. AB SE PARTICLES HAVING DIFFERENT DIE PENSIONS AND SHAPES MAY BEHAVE THE SAME IN THAT AND BASS WILL HAVE TO SAVE EVERY DYNAMIC SIZE. WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT IT'S IT SAYS WHY IT THIS PARTICLE MAKER IN THAT WAY AND THAT'S WHERE IT COULD LINES AND THE FULL WHERE EXPOSURE MIKE K. SO THIS PHASE WHICH CAN REACH THE CENTRAL AT WAYS OR TRUCK YEAH. AB DID IT HAPPEN IRATE DYNAMIC DAMAGE LESS THAN TEN MICRONS AT US HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS SAT IN SIZE AT APPROXIMATELY AND THOSE THAT CAN REACH THE DEEP PLAN COVERED IRATE DYNAMIC DYNAMIC TO. LESS. THAN TWO POINT FIVE MICRONS. AB ARE THESE REPORTS SIZE FRACTIONS WHICH WILL SAVE WILL WHEN WE MEASURE UP PARTICK ACT THE BEST M. HE EXPECTS. THERE IS EMAIL MY BY NOT NAY APTLY IS YET FIFTH. A RISK FACTOR FOR MOST GOOD. EVAN OF IRAQ. SPECIFIC KEPT AND POINT FIVE THAT'S LINKED TO S. TO SEE FROM PRIVATE TO AMONG TO. SITE THIS IS GRAY OF ITS PINT AS YOU CAN SEE ON THIS GRAPH HERE AND HE CAN SEE THIS INCREASED RISK. FOR CARDIOVASCULAR RESPIRATORY DISEASES. BUT IT'S A PERCEIVED AS SMALL FOR. OF THIS APART MATTER DR TOXICITY THIS IS NOT YOU STILL BE RECESSED IN THE LONG ESTABLISHED EQUITY COMMUNITY. AND THE MICROPLASTIC CONTENT IN THESE AFRICANS HAVEN'T BEEN QUANTIFIED YET AND SAY THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF MICROPLASTIC INHALATION EXPOSURE TO RESPIRATORY AND CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH HEALTH OUTCOMES. IS STILL AT NINE. I'M THAT'S WHY MY LOT FIFTEEN ABDUCTING APPLYING DIFFERENT ANALYTICAL METHODS TO INVESTIGATE THE MICROPLASTIC CONTENT OF THESE IMPORTANT SIZE FRACTIONS AND CURRENTLY- WHILE WORKING ON INDOOR AND OUTDOOR AT. SAFETY INHALABLE MICROPLASTICS OKAY IT YES BUT WITH SOME UNCERTAINTY AS PROOF OF PRINCIPLE FOR OUR ANALYTICAL MESSAGE ME ANALYZED IF YOU HAVE TEN SAMPLE M. I. WE FOUND DAVID TWO AND A HALF THOUSAND MICROPLASTICS TO KEEP IT MAKES A- I'M JUST THE PERSON CONTEXT FOR EQUIPMENT. AB SIZE RANGE FOR TOTAL PARTICULATE MATTER. YOU CAN SEE IT IS ALMOST TEN MILLION PEOPLE PARTICLES THEY KEEP IT MAKES OF ASK FEDERAL MICROPLASTICS BUT THERE ARE OF COURSE LOTS OF COPY AT SIERRA. FIRSTLY MICROPLASTIC IS TALKED NUMBER A SECONDLY THIS IS REALLY CREATE ESTIMATE WE NEED SOME RIGHT BEST EXPOSURE CONCENTRATIONS IN DIFFERENT TYPES F ENVIRONMENTS IN DIFFERENT. LOCATIONS OVER TIME. HOWEVER WHAT'S IMPORTANT EVEN IF THIS REPRESENTS A SMALL FRACTION OF AMBIENT PARTICULATE MATTER IS THAT MICROPLASTIC IS PERSISTENT. SIR IF IT WORKS TO KEEP AN EYE IN THE BODY ACROSS THE STATE A TIME IT COULD REACH CONCENTRATIONS THAT BECAME DETRIMENTAL TO HEALTH AND BECAME A HOUSE IT. IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION TO POTS TO EXPOSURE BUT ALSO THE RELATIVE PAY AGENCY THAT COMBATS OF THE PARTICLES RACKSPACE TO AND. OF COURSE SEVEN THOUSAND EXTRA FACTS. SO THERE IS SOME OF THAT MICROPLASTICS IN THAT WAY CAN CAUSE HARM AB OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO HIGH LEVELS OF PLASTIC TEST WHICH ARE SMALL ENOUGH TO REPLACE DEEP POT THE POTS OF THE LINK. AB CAN CAUSE ADVERSE EFFECTS DISRAELI'S THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THERE WERE OUTBREAKS OF DISEASE AND SYNTHETIC TEXTILE WORKERS THE VICE WELL DEFINED ITS CLOCK BECAUSE LUCK. AB THIS IS THE NYLON FLOCKING INDUSTRY WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY A SHORT CUT NYLON FIBER. AND WHEN IT'S CUT WITH A MALE IT GENERATES THE DUST WHICH IS VERY VERY FINE REACH THE LOWER. EAST TO THE DISEASE AB ASIDE FROM PATIENTS PRESENTING WITH CHEST PAIN AND SHORTNESS OF BREATH COUGH THE DISEASE CAUSES CHRONIC INFLAMMATION AND TISSUE SCARRING. IN THE LIVER ADVICE. NO THIS IS A REGISTER IT USUALLY TO AFTER REMOVAL EXPOSURE BUT IN SOME WAYS CASES IT KIND OF FALLS INTO YOUR SPIRIT TO FIGHT YEAH. AND HIGH EXPOSURE CONCENTRATIONS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED SITE THESE ARE MUCH GREATER THAN WHAT WE TAX EXPERIENCE IN THE ENVIRONMENT- BUT OF COURSE IT RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHY BAYERN MENTAL EXPOSURE A FULL A FOR A LONGER TIME PERIOD. WHAT D. S. M. IT SHOWS WHAT THESE PARTICLES LOOK LIKE BECAUSE YOU MAY THINK THAT FIVE IS AND SOME OF THEM CERTAINLY OFF FIBROUS BUT SOME OF MY OLD SITE PARTICULATE AS WELL. IT'S NOT JUST BEING OBSERVED FOR NINE FLOCK BUT FOR POLICE. POLY AND RIGHT ON WHICH IS SIMILAR TO CELLULASE ACETATES AS WELL. AS OF COURSE THIS RAISES QUESTIONS IS THIS EFFECT BECAUSE IT'S A PERSISTENT MATERIAL IN THE LONG OR CERTAIN ATTRIBUTES OF THE MATERIAL WHICH MAKES IT PARTICULARLY INFLAMMATORY. THERE'S ALSO EVIDENCE FROM ANIMAL STUDIES REGARDING MY CAUSTIC TOXICITY IN THAT IT THE LONG SORRY THE RIGHTS BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE RELATES TO WHAT IS BEING TOXIC FACTS. SPECIFICALLY HIGHLY TOXIC EFFECTS THE ETHYLENE OXIDE PROPYLENE OXIDE BUT LUCKILY WE DEBT RATING COUNTS THE IN THE APARTMENT. IT JUST STAYS UP AB. BASED IN OCCUPATIONAL SETTINGS ON ANIMAL STUDIES MICROPLASTICS. APPEAR TO CAUSE TOXICITY. HOWEVER THE VERY FEW STUDIES WHICH OFTEN LAST AB IS OF AND SAID IT'S IN SPECIE STRESS. HOW THIS RELATES TO HUMANS AND SPECIES WE'RE COMPOSED AND THEY ARE OUT DAY SITS WITH MAJORITY BEING TODAY FOR TWENTY IS A GUY WHO SAYS DEFINITELY IN NEED OF AN UPDATE AND WE DEFINITELY NEED TO FILL IN SOME OF THESE CRUCIAL KNOWLEDGE GAPS. SO HOW MUCH MICROPLASTIC CAUSE HARM WELL TELL SEIZE ALREADY TOUCHED UPON INFLAMMATION SO IF A MICROPLASTIC WITH SEE YOU INTERACT WITH AND I WAY STYLE OR INTERVENE STYLE. THIS WOULD TRIGGER A PRIOR INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE WHICH COULD LEADS TO TISSUE DAMAGE. HAD BEEN UP AUDIO TRYING TO REPAIR THAT TISSUE DAMAGE THAT BECAUSE I'VE AT THE STIMULUS IS CONSTANT OLD PERSISTENCE AS MICROPLASTICS SAW. THIS TISSUE REPAIR ELEMENT COULD BECOME HEIGHTENED DAVID TIME AND THAT'S WHAT WITH THE TO SCARRING AND EVENTUALLY IN WEST CASES LOSS OF FUNCTION FOR THE TISSUE ORGAN. OF COURSE THIS IS A HYPOTHESIS WHICH NEEDS TO BE TESTED FOR MICROPLASTICS BUT IT IS A PROPOSED. ADVERSE OUTCOME PATHWAY FOR OF A CONSISTENT PARTICLES. BUT ENTITLED. BUT IN A DAY CARE AND ISOLATE WHEN I. THEM AND I. OF THERE ARE PARALLELS OF THE PARTICULATE MUST SAY WE IN ITSELF IS A- MIXTURE SO THE RIGHT CHEEK SEE A REPRESENTATIVE COSTS. FOR A MINUTE BEEN SACKED GOAL FOR TRAFFIC COMMISSION YOU CAN SEE IS A- COAL METALS AND DIFFERENT CHEMICAL SPECIES ON THE SURFACE. AND THE SAME CAN HAPPEN FOR MICROPLASTICS IN THE ENVIRONMENT SO WHETHER THESE PARTICLES ALSO CONTRIBUTE HOME BY DELIVERING DAY USES OF THESE M. AMBIENCE THAT. SPECIES IS ALSO OF CONCERN. I JUST WANTED TO THE GOOD AS WELL BECAUSE M. AS WELL AS I'VE MENTIONED MESA THE PARTICLES THAT HAVE BEEN OBSERVED IN ASPHALT MICROPLASTIC PARTICLES WHAT WE CONSIDER COSTS OR LARGER THAN THE COURSE MIGHT. IN A BIG OF AT TEN MICRONS IN SIZE IS DOESN'T MEAN THE WHITE AND HILUM IT JUST MEANS IF WE DO THEY'LL PROBABLY TO POSIT OUT NAY USE ENOUGH FOR IT TO THE MOUTH I WILL SOLELY THEM AND THAT LEADS TO EXPOSURE AT THE CUTS. AND OF COURSE JOIN OF A SOURCES SUCH AS FROM THE DIETS FROM DRINKING WATER FROM THE DUST. OF THE IS EVIDENCE OF THIS TALK OF EXPOSURE. WITH OBSERVATIONS OF HUMAN. SO IS A VERY SMALL. STUDY ADMITTED IT'S EVIDENCE THAT. FIERY JUST. ANAK QUESTION. WHAT'S IS THIS. DISTRIBUTION IN JUST POTS. AND REFER. WHAT COMES SCOTT. AND BECAUSE THE SMALL THE PARTICLE THE MORE LIKELY THAT RESPECT. FOR INTERACTION WITH CELLS AND TISSUES EIGHT INTO UP TAKE. A REVIEW FROM THE GUIDANCE TO CHEESE. THANK YOU TOXIC EFFECTS A KID IN THE CUT OF IT JUST AND ADAM AND OF THESE OF AND FOR. REDUCE MUCUS SECRETION AND- AFFECTED TO GET TO MY CAR BY A- THERE'S ALSO EFFECTS IN THE LIVER WHICH CAN OCCUR WHICH EXCEEDS OF CHANGES AT THE TOP OF THE SAID AND IN FACT COMPOSITION. BUT ALSO EQUALLY THERE ARE SOME CITIES WHICH IS OBSERVED BY. I HAVE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS AS WELL. I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE CITY'S WORLD AND WAY OF. JUST ONE OR TWO POLHEMUS SAY THE MAJORITY THAT COUPLE OF STYRENE ON THE ADMINISTERED THESE. PARTICLES BORSA AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS. IT'S VERY HARD TO MONITOR THE DICE THAT'S DELIVERED TO THE ANIMAL BECAUSE SADDAM HOLES HELP THEMSELVES TO WATER ACT HAWK. AND ADDITIONALLY IT IS A QUESTION AIFA AT. THE DATE THE TASTE IN TERMS OF HOW THE PARTICLES WERE DISPERSED IN THE WATER LEVEL SACRAMENTO OUT OVER TIME DELIVERING A VERY HIGH DAIS. AND EXPOSURE IS ALWAYS SOME. COPYCATS SO M. I'M GONNA SAY AWAY FROM THE FACT THAT OUGHT TO GET IN A- STOP ONCE WHEN IT COMES MY CLASS AND HOW. I THINK ONE OF THE MASON. ONES IS HOW TO REACT. TO AB HOW DOES THIS DE BY JOE. AND GIVE THESE AND DAY. OF COURSE WE NEEDS A MORE ABOUT THE POTENTIAL. EFFECTS IN HUMANS HOWEVER THE SYSTEM AB DRIVEN BY CAUSTIC TIGHT OF SHAPE HOWEVER THEY SUCH THE ON IMPORTS A TOTAL. I WHAT ABOUT THE- FILE. WITH A LIST OF MY- TO COURSE THESE. KNOWLEDGE GAP IN MY I JUST IT ARE YOU THE POINT THAT. THE MAY BEEN IN WE ALL ALL LABOR. FACEMASK THAT TO. THIS IS LIKELY GOING TO A PART OF A FUTURE THE NEXT YEARS. THESE MATERIALS. I WOULD BE SAID ABBOTT SUGGESTS NOT SHUTTING OF THESE FIVE IS SERVICE MASKS INTO THE NASAL CAVITY. COULD TRIGGER IT KEEPS INFORMATION. AB SIMPLISTIC BUT ITIS. ADDITIONALLY WILL MAKE. SOME WITH THE WITH A GOOD JOB REDUCE THE OVER SOURCES A EMISSIONS OF APPLICATIONS SUCH AS THE- X. AND- SOLID FUEL BETTING. BUT WAS STILL GOING TO BE USING PLASTIC AND A STILL LEGACY LEFT SAID IT'S PLASTIC LESSER THE ENVIRONMENT WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO DEGRADE. TO THE ACTIVATION PROFILE IS GOING TO CHANGE AND POSSIBLY FLUX TOWARDS A HIGHER LEVEL OF MICROPLASTIC. AS THERE IS AN EMERGING ISSUE. I'M SORRY FOR SPEEDING THREE THEM I HAD A FAVOURITE I'M VERY SORRY BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND PARTICULARLY FOR STAYING UP TO LA ELEVEN FIFTEEN ALL. IN LONDON- WHAT DO HAVE QUESTIONS. OKAY THREE OF US. THANK YOU TO ALL THE PER- SO YOU MENTIONED THAT SINCE WE'RE ALL WEARING THESE FACE MASKS AND THEY SHOULD HAVE YOU KNOW THAT THAT WAS THE BIGGEST CONCERN RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IT'S- CURRENTLY OUR REALITY- WHAT COULD WE BE DOING WE ARE WE IN A YEAR ARE WE GOING TO SEE THE EFFECTS OF THIS SOME MEDICAL AFFECTS. AND I'M IS A REALLY GOOD QUESTION AND I THINK IT IS A SITE IS JUST A MANAGING IT IS ONE PAPER THAT'S COME OUT TO SHOW YOU. THE TO SHOW YOU THIS AB. AND I THINK PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH INFLAMMATORY EFFECTS IN THE NASAL CAVITY SIMILAR TO YOU AS- WELL IT'S COLD AT A RECENT RUN ITIS OR NON ALLERGIC RHINITIS. AT SYMBOL TAX MARINO I WASTED ISN'T IT NICE COMMITTEE AND THIS WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH. THE NUMBER OF PLASTIC. FIBERS IN THE NIGHTS. I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES IS THAT. OBVIOUSLY NEED TO BUY A PTA PART OF MANAGING THIS POPPED UP. BUT DOES ALSO OF. YOU KNOW WE'VE NOT HAD TO THE SPEED AT THIS TIME SAID AS PER A LOT OF MY OUT WHICH WE REALLY KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE QUALITY. WE DON'T KNOW HOW I THINK IT DOES AND WE DON'T RATING EVEN I WILL BOTH NOT SHUTTING IS WHAT SOCIETY THINKS ABOUT. IF IT'S A POSSIBLE DRIVING THIS IF IT'S ASSOCIATED ADDITIVES AB SO WE DEFINITELY NEED STABLE MORE RESEARCH RATING FIGURE OUT BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO MANAGE THE PANDEMIC'S AYE I THINK UNTIL. MORE EVIDENCE COMES OUT OF IT WE CAN'T REALLY MAKE A CONCLUSIVE DECISION I'VE AWAY AS TO AS TO WHAT. WE DO WHICH IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD. OKAY WELL THANK YOU EVERY IT'S VERY CONCERNING TO ME I HAD. I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW US AND HELEEN. OF MICROPLASTICS. VIA THESE MASKS THAT WEAR AND WEARING AND- THAT IS DEFINITELY IT LIKE YOU SAID IT'S NOT REGULATED ON WHAT TYPE OF MATERIALS ARE BEING USED IN. WERE JUST ALL BEING ASKED TO JUST PROTECT OURSELVES RIGHT AWAY OR SOMETHING- AND SO THANK YOU FOR ALERTING US DEFINITELY. THAT'S OKAY WELL I WOULD SAY IS THAT THAT IT SENATE KEATS AFFECTED SAY IF THE MOMENT HE D. FEEL DISCOMFORT FROM YOUR FACE MASK YOU CAN YOU KNOW YOU COULD PERHAPS CHANGE INTO IT TO A DIFFERENT MATERIAL OR A DIFFERENT TYPE AT LEAST TO SEE IF THAT WOULD ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM. THANK YOU. WELL FOR A FEATHER ALAN ALL RIGHT WORK BUT I'M SINCE YES YOU MENTIONED THIS IS OUR INTERNATIONAL PANEL AND I'M I GUESS MY QUESTION TO THE LAST PANEL HOW TO DO IT- WHAT. THE BEST PRACTICES RATHER JURISDICTIONS AND I'D LOVE TO ASK OUR- FRIENDS FROM THE UK OR CANADA ELSEWHERE IF THERE ARE SOME GOOD EXAMPLES THAT THEY LIKE US TO KNOW ABOUT ON THE PUBLIC POLICY SIDE RELATING TO THESE. IT INTENSE. SCIENTIFIC CHALLENGES- THAT THE WE OUGHT TO BE AWARE OF YOUR IN CALIFORNIA WITH A B. IN THE U. AND U. K. CANADA OR ELSEWHERE. I GUESS I CAN I CAN GO AHEAD AND ANSWER FIRST- FIRST OF ALL I WOULD SAY THAT I. CALIFORNIA'S AHEAD OF THE CURVE RIGHT NOW I THINK IN TERMS OF TRYING TO. BETTER UNDERSTAND- THE EFFECTS OF DRINKING WATER REGULATING TO BE A TO HAVE TO MEASURE IT EXAGGERATED AND YOU KNOW BOTH. DR RIGHT AND MYSELF ARE BOTH ON HIS WORK WORKING GROUP'S WITH AND SCORED. I WOULD SAY SOME POLICIES THAT CANADA IS STARTING TO TAKE THAT I'VE BEEN IMPRESSED WITH OUR I'M- MORE AROUND SOURCE REDUCTION WILL END AND INCREASING AND SCIENTIFIC. AWARENESS SO THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FUNDING THAT'S GONE TOWARDS SCIENCE AND IN CANADA. TO ASK QUESTIONS THAT RANGE FROM THE SOURCES THE FATE THAT AFFECTS TO BOTH WILDLIFE AND HUMANS- SO SCIENTIFIC FUNDING IS OBVIOUSLY VERY USEFUL BUT WE'RE ALSO STARTING TO SEE AN- LEGISLATION THAT INVOLVES BOTH DEBT REDUCTION OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC ITEMS THAT ARE. NOT AS SUSTAINABLY MANAGEABLE SO THEY CAN'T BE RECYCLED THAT ARE COMMONLY FOUND IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND- POSE RISKS TO WILDLIFE- AND WE'RE ALSO SEEING RECYCLING STANDARDS TO TRY TO INCREASE RECYCLABILITY TO TRY TO BUILD A MORE CIRCULAR ECONOMY. OR SEEN OR EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY GOING ACROSS THE PROVINCES AND MORE HARMONIZED WASTE MANAGEMENT YOU CAN GET. GREAT I'M- AND I AM HAPPY TO. ANY OF THAT IN. WITH YOU BUT I THINK I THINK THERE REALLY GREAT THINGS COME OUT OF CALIFORNIA WAS AND DAHLE BEING WRITTEN SO DEATH. YOUR INTO SPACES WELL- AGUIAR-CURRY YOU ON THIS. RECYCLING MY CONCERN WITH RECYCLING IS. THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER A WHOLE LOT WHETHER A PLASTIC GOES INTO LANDFILL. OR WHETHER IT GETS RECYCLED IN TERMS OF THE POLLUTION THAT'S BECAUSE- SO OUR BIG PROBLEM IS REALLY- TIRES- LEADER- ILLEGAL DUMPING BECAUSE IT GOES INTO A LANDFILL THE CHANCES OF IT GOING SOMEWHERE ELSE IS VERY SMALL IF THE LANDFILL IS PROPERLY MANAGED. SO I THOUGHT I DON'T THINK RECYCLING IS GOING TO HELP WITH THIS PROBLEM BUT I'D BE GLAD FOR YOU TO CONTRADICT ME. SURE NOW I APPRECIATE THAT I THINK FROM A- REALLY A MICROPLASTIC PERSPECTIVE AND THINKING ABOUT HOW MUCH PLASTIC IS GOING INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. I SURE WHETHER IT GOES INTO A CONTAINS LANDFILL OR INTO A RECYCLING FACILITY IT'S NOT GOING INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. HOWEVER I SOMETIMES WHEN WE RECYCLE OUR WASTE IT GETS SHIPPED ELSEWHERE AND SO IF IT GOES INTO GOES TO A COUNTRY THAT DOESN'THAVE THE SAME. I WASTE MANAGEMENT STANDARDS AS THE UNITED STATES THAN THAT MATERIAL AND CAN BE DUMPED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT- SO YES BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO TRY TO CREATE MATERIALS THAT ARE MORE RECYCLABLE THAT DO BUILT INTO A MORE CIRCULAR ECONOMY BECAUSE IT GETS RID OF SOME OF THOSE SINGLE USE. ITEMS THAT ARE OFTEN JUST HOSTAGE BECAUSE WE DON'T VALUE THE MATERIAL AND WE'VE SORT OF- CREATING MATERIALS THAT ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE LITTERED SO I THINK AND MEDIAN LEE I AGREE WITH YOU IN THE LONG TERM- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. THANK YOU A LOT OF OTHER ALLEN WHICH IS WHATEVER WHEN I MET YES IF THERE'S ANY THOUGHTS FROM OUR OUR FRIEND FROM- THE U. K. RIGHT I WANT TO JOIN MY THANKS. AND YOU FOR STAYING UP- WE SHOULD HAVE THIS THIS YEAR IN THE MOST HERE. THAT'S FINE SIR COULD YOU ME OF THE A AFTER JUST A YOU COULD SPEAK TO SOME SOME. THAT WE WOULD YOU LIKE TO VIEW YOU THINK MIGHT BE THIS WE CAN LEARN FROM IN THE U. K. OF THE YEAR OR ELSEWHERE THAT YOU'VE BEEN TRACKING I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE YOU KNOW YOU'RE COMING AT THIS FROM A SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVE BUT OBVIOUSLY WE'RE- COMING OUT FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE I'D LOVE TO HEAR. SOME BEST PRACTICES YOU MIGHT BE AWARE OF. YEAH SHOULD ABSOLUTELY- I'M SORRY. AS SUCH TALK ABOUT THE- THEY HAVE. SAVE IT UP TO ADD PRECAUTION PRINCIPLE WHICH I THINK IS YOU NAY WHEN THERE'S A CERTAIN DEGREE OF SCIENTIFIC UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING SOMETHING AND SAY THEY'VE- RECOMMENDED STEPS TO MINIMIZE MICROPLASTICS RELEASED TO THE ENVIRONMENT SWITCH TO NOT SETTING REGULATE THREE STEIN BUT ITS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MEMBER STATES TO YOU FOR LIFE. IN THE U. K. WE'VE GOT A FEW DIFFERENT INITIATIVES SAY- THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE BONDS WILL HAVE A TAX ON LIKE PLASTIC BAGS STRAWS AB OF COURSE IS A QUESTION A FAT HOW. MUCH THAT WILL M. HELP THE MICROPHONE IS. DOES NOT SUMMARIES. M. AS WELL AB UNLESS IT REALLY WENT WE'RE NOT IN A WAY THAT THE THING THAT I DON'T GET FRUSTRATED THAT IS THE I THINK A LOT OF THE STEPS THAT TAKEN. AT IN TERMS OF POLICY REGULATION AT THE MOMENT SEEMS TO BE FOCUSED ON REDUCING SINGLE USE PLASTIC **** IN ART SO TIGHTLY GOODS BUT ALSO RECYCLING OF BY PHASE ARENA STATE REALLY. HELP THE FIBRO TO CA. AS A TWO. I THINK YOU KNOW ONLY SEEMS LIKE WE'RE DOING BECAUSE WE'RE TACKLING PLASTIC CHEAP IT FROM MY- ONLY NAY THAT PAVE TIRE ON FIVE ZERO THEY- SOURCE. AB I THINK I JUST NEED BRING AGAINST THE CONVERSATION. AS WELL OKAY- WE NEED TO GET ON TO THE PANEL THREE UNLESS SOME OKAY WRITTEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALLOCATE. HALF THANK YOU ALL THIS IS. REALLY INTERESTED AND BEGAN REALLY DEPRESSING- BUT IT'S IMPORTANT WE MOVED AND FIND. SO I FOR DR OCKMAN WHO I KNOW HAS DONE- RESEARCH ON SOURCES AS WELL AND COMING BACK TO THAT QUESTION OF. SAID WHERE SURE ENERGY PLACED FIRST DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT THE MOST. PREVALENT SOURCES OF MICROPLASTICS ARE IN THE ENVIRONMENT IS IT THE FIBERS IS OF THE TIRES WHERE SHOULD WE BE FOCUSING OUR ENERGY. YEAH THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION I WAS. HEAVILY INVOLVED IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY PROJECT I'VE ALSO DONE SOME WORK UPSTREAM IN THE SACRAMENTO BEE DELTA- I THINK I WOULD SAY I COMPLETELY AGREE THAT TIRE DUST AND- MICROFIBERS NEED TO BE- SOMETHING THAT WE FOCUS ON I THINK WE CAN THINK ABOUT- RETIRES A BIT OF A WICKED PROBLEM AND IT'S A TOUGH ONE FOR MICROFIBRES AND PUTTING FILTERS ON WASHING MACHINES WILL ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE. WE HAVE THE FILTERS ON THE WASHING MACHINES OF- TWO HUNDRED HOMES IN THE SMALL TOWN OF PARRY SOUND UP HERE FEEDS TREATMENT PLANT WE'VE SEEN A REDUCTION OF MICROFIBERS BY 10% SINCE WE'VE DONE ESTO- IT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE. THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY TO YOUR QUESTION IS IF WE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING QUICK AND I'D BE INTERESTED WHAT ON OTHERS THAT WOULD HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS FROM THE PANEL. IS FOCUSED ON PATHWAYS INSTEAD OF THE PRODUCT UPSTREAM I AGRICULTURAL RUNOFF STORMWATER RUNOFF AND WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS ARE ALL PATHWAYS THAT MICROPLASTICS GO THROUGH TO ENTER THE ENVIRONMENT- BY A RETENTION CELLS AND RAIN GARDENS ON STORM DRAINS WILL. PREVENT MICROPLASTICS FROM GETTING INTO THE ENVIRONMENT- CHANGING WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS ARE TWENTY EIGHT I KNOW THAT'S VERY EXPENSIVE BUT THE FILTERS ON WASHING MACHINES CAN CERTAINLY HELP WHAT GOES INTO THEM. AND WITH ADDED RUNOFF WE CAN THINK ABOUT AND USING MAYBE WETLANDS ARE OTHER WAYS TO FILTER THE WATER BEFORE IT GOES OUT INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. AND THIS IS WHAT THE O. S. D. REPORT THAT COMES OUT THIS MONTH WILL FOCUS ON. I'M IN A MAJOR WAY IS WHAT ARE THOSE PATHWAYS AND HOW CAN WE PREVENT. OKAY L. THREE IS GOING TO FOCUS ON THIS AREA. SO WHY DON'T WE GET TWO PANEL THREE UNLESS SOMEONE. HAS A BURNING QUESTION. THANK YOU SO MUCH YEAH- GOOD. TO LAUNDER. SO PALE THREE. WOMEN EXPERTS IS A VERY STRONG STRATEGIES FOR MASS MY- POLLUTION. AND I USE THE TERM MAN LIVE BECAUSE THE SIZE STILL EMERGING ON MICROPLASTICS IS STILL MUCH TO STUDY AND UNDERSTAND ABOUT HOW MICROPLASTICS IMPACT OUR RESOURCES AND OUR BODIES. AND WITH THAT WE WILL NEED TO LEARN ABOUT AND POTENTIALLY DEVELOP TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN REMEDIATE MICROPLASTICS IN WATER SOIL. AND- PERHAPS EVEN THE AIR. IN THE MEANTIME WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT CAN BE DONE TODAY TO ADDRESS THIS TOXIC POLLUTION SOURCE REDUCTION WOULD BE THE MOST EFFICIENT. AND WASTE MANAGEMENT IS ALSO A GROUP CRITICAL STRATEGY. FIRST I'D LIKE TO INVITE DOCTOR FERAL LAVENDER LAW WITH THE SEA EDUCATION ASSOCIATION TALK TO US ABOUT THE NEED FOR SOURCE REDUCTION. LITTER MANAGEMENT AND ILLEGAL DUMPING ABATEMENT- DOCTOR LAW YOU HAVE A FIVE TO SEVEN MINUTES FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH I ACTUALLY DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO SHARE MY PRESENTATION. OF HER UP THERE WE GO. OKAY. OKAY I'M HOPING EVERYBODY CAN SEE YES LINE. EXCELLENT THANK YOU WILL HAVE TO NOON GOOD EVENING GOOD NIGHT AND THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND CHAIRPERSON DR QUIRK AND THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATIONAL HEARING. I ORIGINALLY CAME TO THIS PROBLEM FROM THE END OF THE PIPE SO BY THAT I MEAN THE OCEAN AND NOT ONLY FROM THE OCEAN BUT FROM THE DEAD END OF THE OCEAN THE SO CALLED GARBAGE PATCHES I'M A RESEARCH PROFESSOR OF OCEANOGRAPHY I'M TRAINED IN OCEAN PHYSICS AND I'VE BEEN ON THE FACULTY OF SEA EDUCATION ASSOCIATION R. S. C. A. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND THREE. I SEE IS A NONPROFIT EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATION OUR PRIMARY OFFERING IS THE SEA SEMESTER PROGRAM FOR UNDERGRADUATES FROM COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND INTERNATIONALLY STUDY WITH US FOR A SEMESTER BOTH ON OUR CAMPUS IN WOODS HOLE MASSACHUSETTS AND I'M ONE OF OUR TWO TALL SAILING SHIPS LIKE YOU SEE HERE THAT ARE ALSO OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH VESSELS. SO WHEN SAILING IN THE SUBTROPICAL LATITUDES OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC IN THE NORTH PACIFIC IN THE SO CALLED GARBAGE PATCHES AS WE DO WITH OUR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS. WHAT YOU WOULD TYPICALLY SEE FROM THE DECK OF A SHIP OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT STOP A NICE CALM DAY YOU'LL HAVE LIGHT WINDS AND NOT REALLY SEE ANYTHING BUT- WATER SKY CLOUDS. YOU WILL SEE FLOATING DEBRIS DRIFT BY AND THESE ARE TYPICALLY SINGULAR ITEMS SOMETIMES IDENTIFIABLE LIKE THIS BOOT. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THESE ARE FRAGMENTS OF SOME ONCE LARGER OBJECT. BUT THERE MOST DEFINITELY PLASTIC FLOATING IN THE SEA SURFACE. BUT IF YOU TELL PLAN TO NOT THROUGH THE WATER AT THE SEA SURFACE FOR JUST THIRTY MINUTES AND SIFT THROUGH ITS CONTENTS YOU FIND SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS THESE ARE OF COURSE THE MICROPLASTICS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. IN THIS CASE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MICROPLASTICS THAT ARE ACTUALLY QUITE LARGE COMPARED TO THE MICROFIBERS AND SOME OF THIS THESE PARTICLES WERE. THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT IN THE LAST SESSION THAT ARE CARRIED BY ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION. SO ARE THE SEMESTER STUDENTS HAVE TEN POINT AND THAT'S THROUGH THE SERVICE OCEAN THE NORTH ATLANTIC AND PACIFIC OCEANS IN THE CARIBBEAN SEA FOR DECADES AND EXAMINE THEIR CONTENTS. AND IN THE REGION'S DUMP GARBAGE PATCHES THIS IS WHAT THE VAST AMOUNT OF DEBRIS COLLECTED CONSISTS OF ARE THESE PARTICLES SO COURSE YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT WHERE THEY CAME FROM. MOST OF THESE PARTICLES DID ORIGINATE FROM LARGER PLASTIC ITEMS THAT WEEKEND AND BROKE APART WHEN EXPOSED IN THE ENVIRONMENT. BUT WHERE THIS DEGREE COMES THESE TINY FRAGMENTS- IT IS UNKNOWN HOW LONG THEY'VE BEEN THERE. WHERE THEY ORIGINATE GEOGRAPHIC ORIGINATED GEOGRAPHICALLY OR WHAT WHAT KIND OF ITEM THEY ORIGINATED FROM. WE DO HAVE PASSED THE SIZE THAT MOST OF THIS ORIGINATES ON LAND IN THIS IS REALLY WHERE WE'RE GETTING TO ON THE TOPIC OF THIS PANEL. SO FIVE YEARS AGO IN A STUDY LED BY MY COLLEAGUE JENNA JAMBECK AT UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA GEORGIA THAT WAS A PRODUCT OF A WORKING GROUP I MARINE DEBRIS AT THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR ECOLOGICAL ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS- CENTER AT. UC SANTA BARBARA. WE ESTIMATED THE AMOUNT OF PLASTIC WASTE MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE GENERATED ON LAND THAT ENTER THE OCEAN IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN. AND THE CANONICAL VALUE THAT EIGHT MILLION METRIC TONS OF SINCE BECOME A BENCHMARK OF THE ANNUAL SCALE OF OCEAN PLASTIC POLLUTION- THIS DOESN'T ACT THANK YOU. I'M FOR ALL OF THE SOURCE ABOUT ALWAYS GENERATED ON LAND. SO THE ESTIMATED PLASTIC WAIT. I'M PUT. FOR THANKS IS ALWAYS. THE RANKS IN SPADES. ON THE ACT TREES THIS MESSAGE ABOUT AN INFORMAL WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SO THIS COULD BE DUE TO A LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE ITSELF OR IT COULD BE DUE TO ACCIDENTAL OR INTENTIONAL LITTERING. IN THIS STUDY WE FOUND THAT THE TOP EMITTING COUNTRIES WORLD IN SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST ASIA DO THEIR RAPIDLY GROWING ECONOMIES AND ASSOCIATED WASTE GENERATION BUT WITHOUT THE CAPACITY TO MANAGE THIS INCREASING AMOUNT OF WASTE. AND SO CONSEQUENTLY THIS REGION BECAME THE FOCUS OF MANY IMPORTANT AND URGENT REMEDIATION EFFORTS. HOWEVER AN OFTEN OVERLOOKED RESULT OF THAT WORK WAS THAT THE UNITED STATES RANKS TWENTIETH AND IT'S CONTRIBUTIONS OF PLASTIC WASTE OUT OF ONE HUNDRED NINETY TWO COUNTRIES. AND THE COASTAL COUNTRIES OF THE E. U. COLLECTIVELY RANKED EIGHTEENTH ON THIS GLOBAL LIST. SO DESPITE HAVING HIGHLY DEVELOPED AN EFFECTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE THE UNITED STATES WAS A TOP CONTRIBUTOR. FOR A FEW REASONS ONE OF ITS LARGE COASTAL POPULATION. AND TO ITS VERY HIGH PLASTIC WASTE GENERATION RATES. SO IN THIS ANALYSIS THE VERY LARGE AMOUNTS OF MISMANAGED WASTE IN THE U. S. WERE SOLELY A CONSEQUENCE OF LITTERING WHICH WAS COARSELY ESTIMATED AS 2% OF PLASTIC WASTE GENERATION. ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF THE JAMBECK STUDY WAS THE VERY SPARSE DATA AVAILABLE FROM MANY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD AS WELL AS A LACK OF STANDARDIZED MEASUREMENT AND REPORTING PROTOCOLS. AND EVEN WHEN THE DATA WERE AVAILABLE ACTIVITIES SUCH AS ILLEGAL DUMPING AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE OF PLASTIC WASTE THE DR RUCKMAN MENTIONED WERE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR. SO THIS MOTIVATED A NEW STUDY THAT WAS PUBLISHED TO OUR LAST OCTOBER WHERE WE LOOKED AT CLOSER LOOK AT PLASTIC WASTE GENERATION IN THE UNITED STATES SPECIFICALLY. AND THE FATE OF THAT WASTE WITH THE GOAL TO ESTIMATE ARE A RESPOND ESTIMATE OF THE LEAKAGE OF PLASTIC WASTE GENERATED IN THE UNITED STATES TO THE ENVIRONMENT GLOBALLY. SO FIRST WE IS NEWLY AVAILABLE DATA- WITHIN OUR COUNTRY TO REFINE THE ESTIMATE OF PLASTIC WASTE GENERATED. AND WE FOUND THAT NUMBER TO BE A STAGGERING FORTY TWO MILLION METRIC TONS IN THE YEAR TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT'S THE DATE OF THE MOST RECENT DATA AVAILABLE. AND THIS WAS THE HIGHEST OF ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD IN THE UNITED STATES WE MAKE MORE PLASTIC TRASH THAN ANYONE ELSE. NEXT WE INVESTIGATED HOW MUCH OF THE WASTE WAS INADEQUATELY MANAGED IN THE UNITED STATES DUE TO BOTH LITTERING. AND ILLEGAL DUMPING. AND TOGETHER THESE PRACTICES ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION METRIC TONS OF PLASTIC WASTE DISPOSED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT WITHIN OUR OWN BORDERS. FINALLY WE ESTIMATED THE EXPORT OF PLASTIC WASTE COLLECTED IN THE UNITED STATES FOR RECYCLING. SO FOR MANY YEARS WE HAVE EXPORTED BALES OF PLASTICS CALLED PLASTIC SCRAP TO COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD FOR REPROCESSING OR RECYCLING. USING TRADE DATA WE DETERMINED THAT 51% OF THE PLASTICS COLLECTED FOR RECYCLING IN THE U. S. FOR EXPORTED EIGHTY NINE TRADE PARTNERS MOST OF. HIS NAME MOST OF WHOM ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO MANAGE THEIR OWN DOMESTIC WASTE SO THE WAY I LIKE TO THINK OF THIS IS HALF OF WHAT I PUT IN THE BLUE BIN. WAS SHIPPED LARGELY TO CHINA AS- WELL USING THE DATA FROM DATA FROM STUDIES OF THE COMPOSITION OF THE SCRAPPY ELS WE CONSERVATIVELY ESTIMATED THE AMOUNT OF PLASTIC MATERIAL THAT WOULD LIKELY HAVE BEEN DISCARDED- IN THOSE PROCESSING FACILITIES BECAUSE IT WAS OF LOW VALUE. AND IN THOSE COUNTRIES WITH HIGH PROPORTIONS OF MISMANAGED WASTE WE ESTIMATED THAT BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND 75% OF THAT DISCARDED MATERIAL WAS DISPOSED OF DIRECTLY INTO THE ENVIRONMENT BY OPEN. DUMPING OR OPEN BURNING BURNING. SO THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF PLASTIC WASTE COLLECTED THE U. S. FOR RECYCLING. THAT WAS EXPORTED AND LIKELY ENTERED THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE COUNTRY PROCESSING THAT WASTE. ABROAD IS UP TO AN ADDITIONAL ONE MILLION METRIC TONS. AND FINALLY FOR COMPARISON TO THAT TWENTY TEN JAMAICAN ALICE'S WE CALCULATED THE AMOUNT OF PLASTIC WASTE GENERATED BY COASTAL POPULATIONS. IN THE FIFTY COUNTRIES THAT GENERATED THE HIGHEST AMOUNTS OF PLASTIC WASTE AND WE FOUND THAT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN UNITED STATES RANKED AS HIGH AS THIRD GLOBALLY AND IT'S CONTRIBUTIONS OF MISMANAGED PLASTIC WASTE THE COASTAL ENVIRONMENTS. WELL I THINK IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING BUT I'LL SAY IT ANYWAY THAT WE'RE FACING A GLOBAL CRISIS OF RAPIDLY INCREASING AMOUNTS OF PLASTIC WASTE FAR TOO MUCH OF WHICH ENDS UP IN OUR SOILS OUR WATERWAYS AND THE OCEAN. AND AS THE LARGEST PRODUCER OF PLASTIC WASTE IN THE WORLD THE UNITED STATES MUST ACT TO SIMULTANEOUSLY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF WASTE WE GENERATE PLASTIC WASTE THAT WE GENERATE. BUT ALSO TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS REPROCESSING AND OUT ALTERNATE DISPOSAL WITHIN OUR OWN BORDERS. SO SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT WAYS FORWARD TO PREVENT PLASTIC POLLUTION. I THINK THE MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD SOLUTION HAS ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED TO THE PLASTIC WASTE PROBLEM IS TO CREATE LESS WASTE IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO THERE ARE MANY APPROACHES TO REDUCE PLASTIC WASTE GENERATION SOME OF THESE MIGHT INCLUDE BANDS OR DISINCENTIVES FOR UNNECESSARY USE. SO EXAMPLES ARE THINGS LIKE THE BIKER READ FREE WATERS ACTOR THE FEES FOR BAGS OR STRAWS OR EVEN FEES TO PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS TO INCENTIVIZE USING LESS PLASTIC THAT WILL BE DISPOSED OF. YOU CAN ALSO DESIGN PRODUCTS FOR REPAIR REUSE TO DELAY DISPOSAL OR CREATE NEW SYSTEMS FOR PRODUCT DELIVERY AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO SINGLE USE PACKAGING. I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT WITHIN THE U. S. WE ADDRESS LOCATION SPECIFIC DRIVERS OF ILLEGAL DUMPING AND LITTERING SO ASKING WHY ARE PEOPLE LITTERING WHY ARE PEOPLE PARK PARTICIPATING IN ILLEGAL DUMPING AND CAN WE REMOVE THE BARRIERS TO PROPER WASTE MANAGEMENT. I THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT- DESIGN OF EXISTING PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING AND POTENTIALLY REDESIGN OF MATERIALS SO THAT THESE ARE CREATED WITH END OF LIFE MANAGEMENT AND LINES AND IDEALLY MAXIMIZING RECOVERY OF THOSE MATERIALS IN A CIRCULAR ECONOMY IS AS AS ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED. AND JUST TO- REEMPHASIZE THAT IT'S REALLY CRITICAL THAT WE EVALUATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE MATERIAL LEAKAGE SO THE PERSISTENCE. THE BREAKDOWN WHICH REALLY MEANS THE FRAGMENTATION INTO SMALLER PARTICLES AND THINGS THAT AND ALSO THINKING ABOUT THE CHEMICAL DEGRADATION PRODUCTS AND ALSO THE IMPACTS ON THE ECOSYSTEM AND HUMAN HEALTH SO THAT WE CAN START TO PRIORITIZE PARTICULAR ITEMS ARE APPLICATIONS. AND BEGIN TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DR LAW AND NEXT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM ELISABETH. DR ELIZABETH FAST MAN BACK. WITH THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COASTAL WATER RESEARCH PROJECTS. TO TALK ABOUT STORMWATER AS A CONDUIT FOR PLASTIC POLLUTION AND CURRENT STORMWATER BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. OKAY JUST. SHARE MY SCREEN. THANKS EVERYBODY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO. SPEAK WITH YOU I AM ONE WELL THAT'S COMING OUT. MY NAME IS DR ELIZABETH FASTENING BACK I AM A PRINCIPAL ENGINEER WITH SQUARE YOU'VE HEARD SCRIPT MENTIONED A FEW TIMES I THINK- MY RESEARCH FOCUSES ON STORM WATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS WHICH ARE KNOWN COLLECTIVELY AS BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES SO I'M GONNA TALK TO YOU TODAY OF- BRING UP SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER. D. N. P. IS OFFER US- SOLUTIONS ARE FEASIBLE SOLUTIONS FOR MANAGING MICROPLASTICS. THERE ARE THREE KINDS OF OPPORTUNITIES I SEE BROADLY SPEAKING AS FOR MANAGING MICROPLASTICS AS THEY MOVE THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENT ONE OF COURSE YOU JUST HEARD A WHOLE. YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT ITS SOURCE CONTROL WHERE WE TRY TO ELIMINATE OR MINIMIZE THE PROBLEM WHERE IT STARTS. I WE'VE HEARD A LOT THAT STORM WATER IS A MAJOR- I HAD MECHANISM FOR MOVING PLASTICS MICROPLASTICS TO THE ENVIRONMENT TO THE OCEAN SO I NEXT OPPORTUNITY IS WITHIN THE URBAN DRAINAGE SYSTEM WHERE FROM A SOLUTION STANDPOINT WE'RE TRYING TO ELIMINATE MY CAR CHECK PLASTICS TRANSPORT BY EITHER TREATING CAPTURED STORMWATER. OR MINIMIZING HOW MUCH STORM WITH- SLOWS DOWN THE STREAM. AND THESE TWO OBJECTIVES ARE REALLY WHAT M. P.'S LONG TO DO FOR OTHER REASONS- FOR VIRTUALLY ALL OTHER TYPES OF POLLUTANTS. IN RUN OFF. AND FINALLY THE LAST SOLUTION IS FILTERING MASS QUANTITIES OF OCEAN WATER AT THE END OF PIPE WHICH I DON'T THINK IS REALLY A VIABLE SOLUTION SO WE'LL JUST. SEND THAT OUT OF IT SO I'M GONNA FOCUS AND BMPS. AND WHAT OPPORTUNITIES THERE MAY BE OR- THAT BRING UP QUESTIONS. I'D THROUGHOUT THE URBAN LANDSCAPE THERE ARE A COUPLE OF OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE CAN CONSIDER. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN SPENDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS TO INSTALL TRASH CAPTURE SYSTEMS WITHIN THE URBAN DRAINAGE NETWORK. CASH CAPTURE SYSTEMS ARE FOCUSED ON REMOVING PARTICLES AND DEBRIS THAT ARE LARGER THAN FIVE MILLIMETERS. I HAVEN'T AND IT BECAUSE THERE IS A QUESTION OF SCALE HERE I QUICKLY FIGURED OUT THAT- FIVE MILLIMETERS IS ABOUT THE SIZE OF YOUR PENCIL ERASER. OR WHATEVER WHEN WE USE THESE PENCILS I'D SAY THE QUESTION IS THAT AT TECHNOLOGY THAT'S USED TO THAT. IS DIRECTED AT. FIVE MILLIMETERS OR LARGER GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR MICROPLASTICS WHICH BY DEFINITION ARE SMALLER THAN FIVE MILLIMETRES. WE HAVE ANOTHER SUITE OF BNP'S THAT ARE CONSIDERED TREATMENT BMPS AND THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES TYPES OF TECHNOLOGY WITHIN THE CATEGORIES OF CHEAP OF BMPS AND THEIR TWO THAT KIND OF GIVE US. MAYBE OPPORTUNITIES FOR TREATING MICROPLASTICS WATER FILTRATION TYPE BMPS AND THE OTHER ARE BROAD SUITE OF BMPS THAT SOAK RUN OFF INTO THE GROUND. AND THEN FUNDAMENTAL THERE IS WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE ENOUGH STORMWATER THERE IS ENOUGH STORM WATER CAPTURE BY BMPS TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AT A LARGE SCALE SO TRUST CAPTURE SYSTEM HOW DO THEY WORK AS I SAID THEY'RE DESIGNED TO CAPTURE LARGE PARTICLES AND DEBRIS. THERE ARE THREE MAJOR CATEGORIES OF TRASH CAPTURE SYSTEMS THAT ARE BEING INSTALLED ALL THROUGHOUT THE URBAN DRAINAGE NETWORKS IN CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE LOTS OF INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS THAT YOU CAN FIND WITHIN EACH OF THESE CATEGORIES BUT HERE THE THREE WAYS IN WHICH THEY WORK. YES WE A STORM DRAIN INSERTS WHICH ARE BASICALLY LARGE MESH TRAPS OR SCREENS THAT CLEAN OUT DEBRIS WITHOUT IMPEDING THE FLOW THROUGH THE STORMWATER NETWORK. REMEMBER FIVE MILLIMETERS IS BECAUSE YOUR PENCIL SO WE'RE NOT TALKING SKILLS TYPING SKILLS REMOVING YOUR WINDOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PRETTY LARGE CHUNKS. BAFFLE BOXES AND HYDRODYNAMIC SEPARATORS ARE TWO CLASSES OF- TRASH CAPTURE SYSTEMS THAT ARE INSTALLED BELOW GROUND. THERE IN LINE WITH THE STORMS THE STORM DRAIN STORY THE STORM A STORM WATER NETWORK- WHERE- SO IT'S IN LINE WITH YOUR PIPE NETWORK UNDERGROUND IN A BAFFLE BOX USUALLY HAVE THIS ARRANGEMENT OF THAT SAME KIND OF LARGE SIZE- MESH SCREEN. AND THEN THE BATTLE'S CREATE THE STAGNANT ZONES WERE HEAVIER PARTICLES CAN SETTLE OUT BY GRAVITY. IN A HYDRODYNAMIC SEPARATOR IT CREATES A SWIRLING ACTION THAT SALARY- AND SEPARATE STATE HEAVIER PARTICLES AND DEBRIS TO SEPARATE OUT OF THE WATER AND FALL TO THE BOTTOM. AND THEN YOU HAVE A BACKTRACK AND BACK TO BACKING TRACK THAT COMES ALONG EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE AND SUCKS OUT THE DEBRIS THAT'S CAUGHT IN THE SYSTEMS. SO ALL. I SORRY ULTIMATELY EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE SYSTEMS ARE AIMED AT VERY LARGE PARTICLES AND- DEBRIS AND SO THEY ARE NOT BY DEFINITION THEY'RE NOT GOING TO CAPTURE MICROPLASTICS. SO LET'S MOVE ON TO FILTRATION TYPE BMPS. YOU HEARD A COUPLE OF OUR PANEL MEMBERS TALK ABOUT RAIN GARDENS AND BY RETENTION SYSTEMS. THESE ARE TWO TYPES OF FILTRATION TYPE BMPS WHOSE OBJECTIVE IS TO CAPTURE RUNOFF FROM SAY A PARKING LOT OR MAYBE AS MUCH LAND AREA AS A CITY BLOCK. AND IT THAT MIGHT HAVE COME INTO- WHAT LOOKS LIKE WHAT LOOKS LIKE A GARDEN ON THE SURFACE. I AND THEN IT FILTERS VERTICALLY THROUGH A MEDIA AT THE SOIL LIKE MEDIA BUT IT'S BEEN ENGINEERED TO TRAP VARIOUS TYPES OF POLLUTANTS. DON'T SAY- WE'RE LUCKY ON THIS THAT DOCTOR SUTTON- ACT HAS OUR TO RESEARCHER THAT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED THE ONLY STUDIES THAT EXIST THAT SAY YES THERE'S PROMISE FOR THIS TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY FOR REMOVING MICROPLASTICS. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THESE ARE SMALL SCALE BMPS THEY TREAT RUNOFF FROM A VERY LIMITED LAND AREA. SO TO HAVE THAT IN IMPACT ON A ON A STATEWIDE BASIS IS VERY CHALLENGING. WE TAKE HAVE REGION SCALE BNP'S. SO THESE ARE BMPS THAT MANAGE RUNOFF OR ACCEPT RUNOFF FROM SAKE A COUPLE OF HUNDRED ACRES MAYBE. OF LAND AREA- BUT THERE'S REALLY NO MECHANISM WITH IN THESE TYPES OF BMPS TO REMOVE POLLUTANTS. I SAID THESE TYPES OF BMPS IS TO TAKE RUNOFF AND SOAK INTO THE GROUND EITHER BMPS WE BUILD FOR GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AND WHAT STORMWATER HARVESTING FOR TO THE SUPPLEMENT POTABLE USES POTABLE AND NON POTABLE USES. THE PROBLEM IS THAT WERE THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM IS THAT AS WATER SOAKS INTO THE GROUND IT MAY BRING THOSE MICROPLASTICS WITH IT IT MAY MIGRATE THROUGH. WE ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW BECAUSE IT'S NEVER BEEN STUDIED. SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS WHAT WE HAVE I THINK IS A CHALLENGE OF SCALE WHEN IT COMES TO BMPS AND THEIR POTENTIAL TO MANAGE MICROPLASTICS. THEY'RE NOT MICROPLASTICS ARE NOT. CAPTURED BY EXISTING TRASH CAPTURE SYSTEMS WE HAVE SOME BMPS THAT SHOW PROMISE FOR MANAGING MICROPLASTICS BUT IT'S ONLY A LOCAL SCALE. MOST B. M. P. INFRASTRUCTURE WILL NOT SCALE SUFFICIENTLY- TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM WITH THE CURRENT PROGRAMS AND POLICIES THAT DRIVE THAT THAT CAUSE US TO BUILD BMPS- AND SO THAT'S- WHAT I HAD TO SHARE WITH YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. VERY MUCH WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING THE TIME. TO BE WITH US TODAY- DR- FASTENING BACK. ARM AND NOW I'D LIKE TO INVITE TO INVITE DR ALEXIS JACKSON. FROM THE NATURE CONSERVANCY TO TALK ABOUT EXPLORING NEAR TERM SOLUTIONS TO REDUCE THE PRESENCE OF PRACTICE PLASTIC PARTICLES ON FARMLANDS. AND LIMIT REENTRY TO WATERWAYS AND OCEAN OF COURSE WE'VE SEEN A COUPLE OF WAYS. FOR OUR PRESENTATIONS ON HOW THE PLASTIC PARTICLES CAN END UP ON FARMLAND FROM- THE DEPOSITION FROM THE AIR AS WELL AS PRESUMABLY FROM- SEWER SLUDGE SO DOCTOR JACKSON- PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANKS AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY I'M TODAY I'M GONNA BE HIGHLIGHTING SOME FINDINGS FROM A STUDY THAT WOULD BE MORE IN COLLABORATION WITH RESEARCHERS AT UC SANTA BARBARA MICRODELETION CALIFORNIA ALSO OUR VALUE ENGINEERING ON. AND THIS IS WORK ON. MY MOTHER OKAY WHAT IS. THANK. JUST GO- IS THERE ANY WAY YOU LOOK AT. ALL IMPROPER OKAY TRY. HI JUSTIN SOMETHING AND THEN TRY AGAIN. NOT SURE WHAT TO. BE USED ON. OKAY. SORRY ABOUT THAT INTERRUPTION SO WE'RE SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT THE SYNTHETIC FIBERS THANK IT SHATTERED FROM THE WASHINGTON AREA AND WEARING REALLY OUR FAVORITE KIND OF STRETCHING FOR. HIGHER AS WE GET ANY BIOLOGICAL AND- MICROPLASTICS THIS YOU MIGHT ARE. WE WANTED TO ACTUALLY WANT BY THE PHONE MAKER I HEARD AND HOW. OUR AND SO WE LOOKED AT THIS. TO EIGHTEEN I MODELED THE- I HEARD YOU NUMBER WE WASHING- WHEN THEY INTO ARE AGAINST AND THEN FALLING. AFTER THERE AND- IT OUT SLIDES I'M AND WHAT ABOUT THIS PLACE AND TO. ENVIRONMENT WHERE. AND SO WE DO WE BY AT. ONE OF. OUR OUR FRIENDS BE MORE IN TWENTY NINE AMONG THESE MANY EXPORT NEXT ON MY EYEBROWS- EQUAL OF THIRTEEN POINT. THREE AND WE ALSO THAT RECORD AN INCREASE IN AND AS LOOK BLACK I. RATIONALLY SHIFTING THE BURDEN. JUDGE FROM THOSE ALRIGHT RESERVED. TO AND SO ACCORDING TO THE FIBERS ARE ANY BRAND. IN PART. AND SO WHAT FINDINGS ARE REALLY TOUGH US THIS WE HAVE A GROWING PROBLEM WITH MICHAEL YOUR HOW AND THAT THIS IS ISSUE NOT JUST. THIS WOULD BE A LOT OF PEOPLE. IT'S NOT THAT ACTUALLY I THINK START TALKING BLUES ESPECIALLY THOSE NEEDS OF OUR THAT WE KNOW OFF. BRAND. THE PRESENCE OF MICROFIBERS HAVE THE SAME IMPACT ON SOIL AS DROUGHT CONDITIONS IMPACTED PRODUCTION DRAMA SOMETHING WE ALL. RIGHT AND ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT THESE MAKE A FIVE AND MAX. I SO OR THAT ALSO IMPACTING- RIVALS. AND THEN THE LAST PART OF THAT WE KNOW THAT PLASTICS. BROWN BEGAN AS OF THE WOODS ARE THAT WORKING- AND THAT THEY CREATE. FOR PERSONAL STOCK. AND SO WHAT WE DO IN LIFE AND THESE KIND OF FINDING WHAT THE NEW YEAR HOME OR. I'M SO ONE OF THE THINGS WAS MEANT TO IS THAT. FIVE EVEN THINK ABOUT DO WE DESIGN. STYLES THEY SHOULD LAST THOSE ARE THINGS THAT YOU DO BRITAIN'S. NOT MAYBE LONG. LIKE MOST. THERE WERE POLICING THAT WAS AND ALSO HOW BETTER CITING. AND SO WITH RESPECT TO BUILT UP ALL OF THE ACTION YOU KNOW THE BIG BANKS YES. YEAH THIS YEAR WE BILLS IN- ASSEMBLYMEMBER IS THE NUMBER. AGAIN TO THIS MY ACT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DID IN OUR IS THAT WE WANT TO MODEL THE- ACCESS. ALL THANK YOU BE STRUCTURED IN A NUMBER. I'M AND SO THIS IS JUST A LABOR OF SOME OF THIS. LOOKING AT THE STUDY SO SOME OF THEM ARE AT WHAT WHAT IT LOOK LIKE IT HOW IS IT SOME KIND OF ALTERCATION BACK. IN WASHINGTON. AND WITH THE PROBLEM WITH YOUR- WEATHER THERE THAT LINE. AFTER HIS AND EARLIER SOME POLICIES LOOK AT WHAT WE LOOK LIKE TO TRAIN FROM A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE. GEN CHIU HIGHER LEVEL I'M THERE ISSUES SO SHE WOULD ALL GUNS INTER IN ONE GET OUT. THIS IS JUST SOME OF THE HIGH LEVEL FINDINGS- THANK YOU MATTER THE SCENARIO MODELING AND WE WERE LOOKING AT WHAT DO THESE POLICY INTERVENTIONS. TO MICROFIBER EMISSIONS ONLINE ALSO LOOK AT THIS WATER THIS MORNING SOME MINUTES I AM RESPOND. SO THE FIRST AWAY ARE YOU NOT ALLOWED OF THESE ARE REALLY VERY SENSE IS THAT THIS SOONER INTERNET. START MORE EFFECTIVE OR EFFORTS ARE TO REDUCE MY PRIVATE. AND SO WE SEE THAT IN AREAS. WHERE. ONE AND- HUNDRED SPEED. IS THAT WILL TREAT NON YOU CAN BE A PART OF SOLUTION I'M WE SEE THAT THOSE ARE HIGHLY WE'RE SEEING AND I DECLINE IN NUMBER MY THERE. THOSE ARE COMING FROM THE- IN LINE- OR WASHER. AND THIS IS LOCAL THAT LINE IS FROM OF. HOW QUICKLY. I'M WE'RE THOSE SOLUTIONS AFTER CALIFORNIA AND THE PERCENTAGE RIGHT SO. I'M SOLUTIONS ARE PUT OUT FOR A 100% OF CALIFORNIANS YOU SEE A SHARPER MIND NUMBER MY NUMBERS THAT ARE ENTERING LANDS FIRST IS WHEN IT'S ONLY IN THE BANK STATE. AND THEN THE THIRD ONE THAT I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY INTERESTING IS THE FACT THAT. THERE'S A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS AROUND WHAT INVESTMENTS BETTER WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT INFRASTRUCTURE. ENGINE THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT IF ARBITRATION ADDITION BETTER THIS WILL HELP US ALL. WE ACTUALLY SEEMS AREAS SIX DID THIS IS THAT SEEN IN. IN MY. WHY IS THAT THAT'S BECAUSE THE AFTER IS THAT USE BROWN'S LINE BY A SOLID. IT IS ACTUALLY JUST READ EQUAL OR MORE. AFTER WE ABOUT SIMPSON'S IN ORDER TO REALLY GENERAL. AND SO. IN WANTED TO TAKE A FROM. S. ASKED WHICH IS DON'T YOU HAVE A GROWING MY- PROBLEM. HERE AND HOW IT'S NOT THAT'S JUST OUT OF HEALTH OUTSIDE OF. RIGHT VOTE COASTAL AND INLAND. LAST BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THE FIRES ARE READ. THE APPLYING A BIOS ALL NINE ALLAFRICA IS. AND ACTIONS GLORIA OUR WATER ARE YOU. BUT I JUST WANT YOU AGAIN- AND I ADDRESS YOUR WELL I AROUND THE STATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR JACK'S- LASTLY I TO INVITE DOCTOR K. O'NEILL WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF. BERKELEY TO TALK ABOUT WHY IN HIGH. WE NEED TO ADDRESS BEHAVIOR AS IT RELATES TO PLASTIC USE AND PASSED PLASTIC WASTE GENERATION. OKAY HEY THANK YOU VERY MUCH DR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR EVERYBODY'S- THE PRESENTATION SO FAR AND I'M UNDERSTANDING AND LOOKING AT THE VIEW YES LET CHAU. SUS RIGHT- AND YEAH JUST TRYING TO GET AT THE. SORRY I WILL SO THANK EVERYBODY AGAIN FOR AMAZING PRESENTATIONS I'VE LEARNED SO MUCH IN THE COURSE OF THE AFTERNOON BECAUSE MOST OF MY WORK IS ABOUT WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL MATTER PLASTICS BUT IT'S INTERESTING TO CAN THINK ABOUT HOW TO APPLY SOME OF THOSE IDEAS AND IDEAS I'VE HEARD TO THINKING CONNECTING WITH CONSUMER BEHAVIOR I JUST BRIEFLY- I AM A PROFESSOR AT UC BERKELEY I WALK ON THE GLOBAL POLITICS MOSTLY OF WASTE AND PLASTICS- BUT INCREASINGLY I'M DRAWN INTO THE LOCAL- POLITICS OF PLASTICS ZERO WASTE THE BUCKLEY LEVEL AND BEYOND BECAUSE SIMPLY WHAT HAPPENS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN THIS. ARENA SO CLEARLY AFFECTS THE STATE AND THE HEALTH OF OUR PLANET. SO- SO MY- AND CONSUMER BEHAVIOR AND I'LL JUST KIND OF GIVE YOU THAT THE FUNDING I HAVE NOW IS THAT- ITS CONSUMER BEHAVIOR IS IMPORTANT BUT IT IS AND IT'S A NECESSARY PROTECT HEART OF THE SOLUTION BUT IT IS BY NO MEANS. SUFFICIENT AND IN FACT ALL THE- LINES OF INQUIRY LINES OF A POLICY MIGHT ACTUALLY BE EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE BUT- FOR MANY FOLKS MICROPLASTICS AND NOT THE MAINFRAME. OF THE GLOBAL PLASTICS PROBLEM A LOT OF STUDIES POINT OUT THAT WHEN THEY TALK TO PEOPLE THE FIRST THING THEY THINK ABOUT A MACRO PLASTICS IN THE OCEAN HAT MICROPLASTICS ARE. KIND OF COMPLICATED A DEPENDS ON HOW THEY'RE FRAMED BUT PUBLIC AWARENESS TENDS TO BE FAIRLY LOW AND THIS SUGGESTS THAT CHANGING CONSUMER BEHAVIOR ON THESE GROUNDS IT IS QUITE HARD. BUT I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MAYBE WE HOW WE MANAGE THAT AND SOME OF THE APPLICATIONS. OF MICROPLASTICS AND ZERO WASTE EUROPE PLASTICS POLICIES TO- THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM AND I WANT TO NOTE TO THE OUTSET THAT. MICROPLASTICS OF THE CONTRIBUTION THAT WE AS WEALTHY COUNTRIES MAKE TO OCEAN PLASTICS POLLUTION. ALL WHILE A LOT OF THE COASTAL ALL FLOW IS FROM- DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AS PROFESSOR LAWS PRESENTATION SHOWED- MORE MICROPLASTICS ACTUALLY COME FROM THE COAST OF THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER WEALTHY COUNTRIES SO THAT GIVES US EVEN MORE RESPONSIBILITY. TO BE THINKING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. SO EXISTING CONSUMER TIME TO SO. THAT THEY'RE AWESOME- WE'VE ALREADY SOMEONE'S ALREADY MENTIONED THE LOWEST IN THE US AND IN EUROPE ON'T RINSE OFF MICROBEADS IN PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE SINCE- TWENTY SEVENTEEN NATIONALLY AND EARLIER OF COURSE IN CALIFORNIA. ARE AWARENESS I DEFINITELY ON THE ON THE UP A WITH MEDIA REPORTS ABOUT MICROPLASTICS ABOUT- BASICALLY ABOUT THE PREVALENCE NOW OF PLASTIC IN THE APPEARANCE OF PLASTICS IN HUMAN BODIES. IN BLOOD. ALL THE WAY UP THE FOOD CHAIN THAT IS CERTAINLY A RAISE A LOT OF AWARENESS NGOS ARE VERY MUCH MOBILIZED AROUND THIS AND AS WE CAN TELL FROM TODAY THE SO MUCH. SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND I THINK HEALTH CONCERNS HAVE REALLY BEEN THE DRIVER. THE MAIN DRIVER WHEN IT COMES TO SPECIFIC ACTION AROUND MICRO PLASTICS- WE HAVE DEVICES THAT WASH AND DRY FILTERS THAT DOCTOR JACKSON TALKED ABOUT THAT'S- A BIT MORE MY NEXT SLIDE. HOWEVER A TIRE FRAGMENTS AND OTHER SOURCES OF MICRO. PLASTICS A MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO ADDRESS FROM A CONSUMER BEHAVIOR PERSPECTIVE ON RECALL FOR MORE HOLISTIC. APPROACH THAT ALSO. FOCUSES ON SOURCE REDUCTION. OTHERWISE THE DR PHIL TO A I'M REALLY- TO. FOLLOWING UP ON EARLIER PRESENTATIONS HERE BUT I WAS LOOKING AT THIS RECENT STUDY THAT STUDY THAT LOOKED AT IN GRAHAM DEVICES BUSES EXTERNAL FILTERS FOUND THEM TO BE. QUITE EFFECTIVE AND ALSO AFFORDABLE I FEEL LIKE I'M DOING A LITTLE AD HE IF A GUPPY FRIEND AND KORABL BUT- THERE YOU GO THE- IDEA OF THEM ONE OF THESE THESE CONSUMERS CHANGES IS TO ENCOURAGE. US TO ACQUIRE FILTERS OR IN IN- IN LAUNDRY DEVICES TO REMOVE- MICROPHONE OF MICROFIBRES FROM UP CLOSE BEFORE THEY ENTER- THE WATER SUPPLY. AND AS I WAS- RESEARCHING THIS AND THINKING ABOUT IT I THOUGHT WELL MAYBE IN A ONE INTERVENTION COULD BE SOME KIND OF ENERGY STAR EQUIVALENT FOR. LOTS OF PLANTS AS IF. THAT HAVE FILTERS HAVE THE MECHANISMS IN THEM TO REDUCE THE ENTRY OF FIBRES INTO THE ENVIRONMENT ENERGY STAR HAS BEEN A VERY POPULAR. PROGRAM AMONG CONSUMERS. BUT THEN I TO WILL WELCOME THINK LEARN FROM MACRO- TO USE THAT THE CAN. TOPLESS IS REALLY MORE MY FIELD OF STUDY. AND NOTED LEE HOW CAN WE CONNECT THIS TO OF ALL THE ZERO WASTE EFFORTS BAG BANS SINGLE USE FOOD WELL ORDINANCES THAT HAVE BECOME PART OF OUR LIVES. AND THIS IN TURN TO PROTECT- PREVENT MICROPLASTICS TO THE EMISSION OF SECONDARY MICROPLASTICS THE GOOD NEWS ON ON THIS FRONT IS THAT GLOBAL POLLS SHOWED CHANGING NORMS ATTITUDES REGARDING. SINGLE USE PLASTICS AND THESE HAVE GENERATED LOCAL NATIONAL AND CROSS NATIONAL INTERNATIONAL REGULATIONS THE BAD NEWS S THAT. THESE MEASURES ARE BEING CHALLENGED- A COUPLE OF FRONTS BOTH BY PLASTICS INDUSTRY IN OTHER OPPOSITION BUT MOST IMMEDIATELY THE PANDEMIC IT COULD IS THREATENING TO UNDERMINE. CONSUMER LOANS AND SUPPORT AROUND REDUCING SINGLE. USE PLASTICS IN OUR DAILY LIVES. SO GIVING A CALL OF EXAMPLES OF CHANGING. SOCIAL NORMS IN THE U. K. YOU SEE- 55% OF RESPONDENTS SAYING THEY CHANGE THEIR FOOD PURCHASING HABITS BASED ON HIS COVERAGE. ON THE HIGH DEGREE OF CONCERN 41% VERY CONCERNED FORTY FOUR VERY CONCERNED. ABOUT PLASTIC AND PLASTIC PACKAGING NOT FROM AN ABSCESS MORI POLL IN THE UK IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THE U. S. SIMILARLY A LITTLE HARD TO FIND THE DIRECT DATA ON PLASTICS THIS IS THIS IS- THE MOST RECENT AND RELEVANT ALL. DATA THAT I FOUND THAT TWO THIRDS OF AMERICANS WOULD BE WILLING TO PAY MORE FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY PRODUCTS PERHAPS IT'S NOT SURPRISING AS A PARTISAN BREAKDOWN HERE. THIS IS THE IN TURN GENERATED ON NATIONAL AND LOCAL SOLUTIONS THIS MAP TO SHOWS THE- STATEWIDE. ACTIONS AROUND PLASTIC SINGLE USE PLASTIC GROCERY BAGS AGAIN CALIFORNIA LEADING THE WAY THERE- AND THE GREEN STATES THEIR UNFORTUNATE CHOICE OF COLOR I WOULD SAY FOR THIS- FOR THIS VISUALIZATION BUT THIS REPRESENTS SOME OF THE INDUSTRY PUSH BACK HE'S A STATE FROM HAVE PREEMPTIVE BACK UP PREEMPTIVE MEASURES TO PREVENT PLASTIC BAG RESTRICTIONS WITHIN FROM EUROPE FROM FROM TEXAS WITHIN THE STATE OR THAT'S NOT SPENT A VERY AGGRESSIVE TURN AS THAT NUMBER HAS INCREASED IN PAST YEARS. AND THEN WE HAVE LOCAL SYSTEM GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO BUCKLEY IT'S SINGLE USE FOOD WEB PRODUCTION ORDINANCE FROM AND LETTER REDUCTION ORDINANCE THROUGH TWENTY NINETEEN- HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO COMBAT SINGLE USE FOOD WHERE IN PARTICULAR WITH. BY REPLACING THE COMPOSTABLE PLASTICS AND A CHARGE AND WILL SERVE MUSICAL PLATES AND CUTLERY UC BERKELEY TO. AIMING TO ELIMINATE ALL NONESSENTIAL SINGLE USE PLASTICS BY TWENTY THIRTY SO THESE MEASURES HAVE BEEN GREAT THEY'VE BEEN BACKED BY CHANGES IN PUBLIC OPINION. AND CHANGES IN IN CONSUMER BEHAVIOR HAPPEN NOTCHED A LONG BY THE AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVES. AND FEES AND SO ON. BUT RIGHT NOW I THINK WE'RE WE'RE IN CRISIS. SO MANY REASONS BUT OF THE MIND ABBAS IS DOING WORK ON ON THE IMPACT OF THE NINETEEN ON ZERO WASTE AND DISPOSABLE- GETTING RID OF DISPOSABLE SINGLE USE PLASTICS AND WE'RE FINDING THAT RIGHT NOW- THIS IS THIS. SINGLE USE PLASTICS ARE BECOMING A PROBLEM AGAIN WEBER BUT THE HOW MASKS THEMSELVES MAY BE A DIRECT SOURCE. OF MICROPLASTICS INTO OUR BODIES AS WE WENT THEM WELL CERTAINLY THAT GOING TO BE- A SOURCE OF MICROPLASTICS IN- WATERWAYS IN THE AIR AS AS THEY ARE DISPOSED OF AND- BUT THINKING ABOUT CONSUMER BEHAVIOR REALLY THIS IS. THIS IS THIS IS BEEN A MAJOR CHANGE WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE OPINION POLL DATA OR- CHANGING BEHAVE DATE DATA WE SEE RETAILERS AND. FOOD BUSINESSES- LIVING VERY QUICKLY TO BAMA. AND ALSO SAW WAS SEEN THE STALLING OF LEGISLATION FRANCISCO- REIMPOSING ITS BAG BAN I THINK THIS IS REALLY CRITICAL WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT POLITICAL ACTION CAN BE TAKEN. TO REDUCE PLASTIC BAG TO- REDUCE MICROPLASTICS GOING INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. SO MY RECOMMENDATIONS- THIS IS JUST BRIEFLY FROM STUDIES THAT. WE NEED TO RAISE PUBLIC AWARENESS- ACTIONS NEED TO ENGAGE PEOPLE IN THEIR EVERYDAY RELATIONSHIP WITH PLASTICS THE STUDY- ON THE TOP THAT IT HIGHLIGHTS THAT pOF SWIMMERS WERE BY FAR AND AWAY THE MOST AWARE OF THE PROBLEM. AND THEN ALSO BUT IT ALSO MEANS TARGETING MANY TYPES OF MICROPLASTICS MIGHT MEAN WORKING OUTSIDE OF THE REALM OF CONSUMER BEHAVIOR. GOING BACK TO THIS NINETEEN EIGHTEEN DATA ON THE FROM THE U. K. HERE THERE ARE ASKED WHOSE PROBLEM IS IT AND YOU SEE CONSUMERS SAYING HEY YOU KNOW IT'S NOT OUR WHOSE IT IS IF ALL OF THE ABOVE BUT IT'S NOT JUST US. PLEASE TAKE ACTION AT OTHER LEVELS COMPANIES THAT PRODUCE PACKAGING THE COMPANY'S CELL PACKAGING AND THE GOVERNMENT. SO I THINK THAT THAT'S A- AN OPINION THAT'S WORTH BEARING IN MIND AS AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO THINKING ABOUT DEALING WITH THIS PROBLEM. SO ULTIMATELY CONSUMER BEHAVIOR IS NECESSARY BUT BY NO MEANS CLOSE TO A SUFFICIENT PART OF THE SOLUTION. OBVIOUSLY WE NEED- THE STANDARD SUITE APPROACHES EDUCATION AWARENESS TRANSPARENCY WHAT GOES INTO PRODUCTS. PRODUCT DESIGNED MULCH MATERIALS ALTERNATIVES LAWS BUT I THINK FIRST AND FOREMOST AS WE MOVE THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC. HOPEFULLY OF THE WE NEED TO ESTABLISH REESTABLISH ZERO WASTE PLASTICS GNOMES ANTI DISPOSAL THE ANTI SINGLE USE DISPOSABLE. AND PROGRAMS AS WE MOVE BEYOND THE PANDEMIC AND OF COURSE MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY AT ANY BE INSTRUMENTAL IN THAT. PROCESS SO I'LL STOP THERE HERE ARE SOME OF THE REFERENCES THAT I- REFERENCE DURING THE TALK AND I'LL UPLOAD QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DR O'NEILL- WE'RE NOW TO A QUESTION PERIOD I'M THE ONLY ONE- WHO ARE. SEEMS TO BE HERE THIS LATE. WE DID RUN OVER TIME- ARE THERE QUESTIONS FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE ONLINE. THE IF SENATOR START OR ONE OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS IS ONLINE YOU'RE WELCOME TO ASK A QUESTION NOW. OKAY SO WE'RE NOW GOING TO GO TO- FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL OF YOU- PANEL OF PARTICIPANTS REALLY APPRECIATE IT AND- YOU KNOW YOU YOU CERTAINLY CHANGED MY VIEW ON A NUMBER OF TOPICS AND I'M SURE OTHERS AS WELL- I ALSO HAVE HERE- MY STAFF- AND THEY HAVE- WHO SET THIS UP AND I REALLY APPRECIATE. THEIR TIME. THAT IS BEING SPENT ON. CELL BY YOU VERY JOSH AND PAGE. ALL RIGHT WE'RE NOW GETTING INTO THE PUBLIC COMMENTS SECTION. SO WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW TWO MINUTES EACH I DON'T SEE ANYONE IN THIS ROOM WHO IT WANTS TO SPEAK. SO WE'RE NOW GOING TO GO. TO LET'S SEE. WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO TO THE PHONE LINE FOR PUBLIC COMMENTS. GET EVERYBODY'S GOT TWO MINUTES TO SPEAK. AND PHONE MODERATOR IT COULD YOU PLEASE PLACE OUR FIRST CALLER ON THE LINE. THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO MAKE A COMMENT OVER THE PHONE PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THIS TIME. IT WOULD BE JUST ONE MOMENT FOR OUR FIRST COMMENTS. IT LOOKS LIKE I HAVE REQUIREMENTS IN THE QUEUE RIGHT NOW AND WE'LL WATCH THE FIRST LINE OF NUMBER TWENTY PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. OKAY HI THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND CHAIRS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK MY NAME IS NOW ON THE COUNTRY REPRESENTING SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY THERE IS AMPLE EVIDENCE OF THE DANGERS OF BOX OF MICROPLASTIC AND HAVE ON OUR HEALTH AND VULNERABLE ECOSYSTEMS BECAUSE OF THIS THE SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT HAS TAKEN ACTION ON THE ISSUE OF MICROFIBERS. AND IS CONDUCTING A PILOT PROJECT TO CAPTURE MICROFIBERS FROM EXISTING WASHING MACHINE WE KNOW EXTERNAL FILTERS HAVE LONG PROTECTED SEPTIC SYSTEMS FROM MICROFIBRES IN OTHER COLLISION AND SO OUR PILOT LEVERAGES THIS EXISTING TECHNOLOGY WE ARE INSTALLING TWENTY EXTERNAL MICROFIBERS POSTERS ON TO WASHING MACHINES USED BY A VARIETY OF SMALL BUSINESS TYPES INCLUDING JANITORIAL SERVICES. SMALL HOTELS HOME OFFICES NAIL SALONS PET GROOMING FACILITIES AND MORE ARE IMMATURE THANK YOU THEIR ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES OF INSTALLING FILTERS ACROSS THE CITY. WE HAVE SELECTED THREE MODELS THE FILTERS PROVEN TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF MICROFIBERS RELEASED. BY 8289% WE BELIEVE THAT TECHNO AND I. COLLAPSE WITH AND WATCHING ME AND YOU. IS THE KEY TO PREVENTING HARMFUL. POLLUTION IN THE FUTURE. HE THEN DISTRICTS COULD NOT ONLY BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR PRODUCT IMPACT BUT ALSO BE ADAPTABLE TO THE CRITICAL NEEDS OF THE PRESENT. WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO REQUIRE NEW WASHING MACHINE TO BE EQUIPPED WITH PROPER FILTRATION SYSTEM. AND NOT THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORT RETROFITS OF EXISTING WASHING MACHINE. THE HARD WORK OF OPEN MINDED SCIENTISTS AND LAWMAKERS HAS MADE CALIFORNIA A CRUCIAL LEADER. IN THE FIGHT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND JUSTICE ADOPTION ADOPTING THESE POLICIES THAT HAS THE POWER TO GUIDE OTHERS IN DOING SO AS WELL. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION- AGAIN I'M NOT ON THE COUNTRY ON BEHALF. OF SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANKS FOR KEEPING TO THE TIME LIMIT- SO DO WE HAVE ANOTHER- PERSON MAKING THE COMMENT. I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT EIGHTEEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THIS IS JESSICA GEIGER WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION SANITATION AGENCIES WE WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR CONVENING THIS HEARING AND ONE AT THE THEATER COMMENTS WITH THOSE FROM DOCTOR RUNNING WITHOUT THE STAND. CHAPTER HAS LONG BEEN ADVOCATING FOR MICROPLASTICS MANAGEMENT THREE STATEWIDE SOURCE CONTROL INITIATIVES WE SPONSORED THE BILL IN TWENTY FIFTEEN TO BAN THE USE OF PLASTIC MICROBEADS IN PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS. AND ANOTHER BILL IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO REQUIRED OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL TO CREATE A STATEWIDE MICROPLASTICS STRATEGY. FOR CONTROLLING POLLUTION PREVENTION IS THE ONLY APPROACH TO MANAGEMENT OF MICROPLASTIC POLLUTION THAT WILL ACTUALLY KEEP MICHAEL CLASSICS FROM ENTERING THE ENVIRONMENT. ARE YOU HEARD TODAY WASTE WATER TREATMENT TECHNOLOGY IS VERY EFFICIENT AT REMOVING RIGHT MICROPLASTICS ESPECIALLY IN THOSE REGIONS THAT HAVE VERY SOPHISTICATED PLAN. HOWEVER REMOVING MICROPLASTICS FROM WASTEWATER DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM AS YOU HEARD TODAY PARTICLE DON'T DISAPPEAR THEY'RE SIMPLY BEING TRANSPORTED TO ANOTHER ENVIRONMENTAL MEDIA BY WAY OF SLUDGE. OR WHAT WE IN THE INDUSTRY CALLED BIOSOLIDS THIS IS CLEARLY SOMETHING AS YOU KEEN INTEREST TO YOU DOCTOR PARK AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU AND THE COMMITTEE ON THIS ISSUE. I DO HOWEVER THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE LAND APPLICATION OF BIOSOLIDS. IS A PROVEN RESOURCE RECOVERY PRACTICE THAT IS HIGHLY REGULATED BY BOTH FEDERAL EPA AND THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. AND ULTIMATELY BIOSOLIDS LAND APPLICATION IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF WITH WATER MANAGEMENT IS ONLY CONDUCTED ON POINT 5% OF CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL LAND. CAPITALIST MONITORING SOURCE CONTROL LEGISLATION THIS YEAR TO KEEP PLASTICS AND MICROPLASTICS OUT OF THE WASTE WATER SYSTEM. EIGHTY EIGHT EIGHTEEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM REQUIRES DO NOT FLUSH LABEL ON ALL BUT LIKE PRODUCTS THAT ARE MADE WITH. ALMOST ENTIRELY PLASTIC FIBERS. AND ARE FREQUENTLY FLASH LEADING TO MICROPLASTIC LEADING INCLINED. WE'RE ALSO STRONGLY SUPPORTING AB SIXTY TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN WHICH REQUIRES MICROFIBER FILTERS ON NEW RESIDENTIAL WASHING MACHINES SOLD IN CALIFORNIA. AND WILL ALSO BE WORKING WITH A FAMILY MEMBER BOWMAN HIS COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL FILTRATION LEGISLATION EITHER MEANINGFUL POLICY CHANGES THAT WILL KEEP THE COLLISION OUT OF THE WASTE WATER STREAM. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE WOULD BE ANOTHER SOURCE CONTROL BUILD RECORD. IN THE COMING MONTHS THANK YOU- YES YOU VERY MUCH YES. AND WE'VE CERTAIN LEARNED A LOT- ABOUT SOURCE OF PLAY.D FIRST TWO. COMMENTS ARE VERY WELL TAKEN. OUR NEXT SPEAKER. Q. RIGHT NINETEEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI BONNIE THEY ALL CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR QUIRK AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THE PANELISTS HAVE DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB EXPLAINING BOTH BROADLY AND IN DETAIL THE PROBLEM THAT MICROPLASTICS POSE ON HUMAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH. WOMEN LIKE PLASTIC WE MUST ADOPT PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE APPROACH AND NOT WAIT FOR THE IMPACT THE BIOACCUMULATION BEFORE TAKING ACTION. AND I HAVE BEEN MENTIONED THROUGHOUT THE HEARING THE MAJORITY OF MICROPLASTICS CAN BE TRACED BACK TO SINGLE USE ITEMS AND TEXTILES. THAT'S WHAT THE LEGISLATURE MUST WORK IN CONCERT TO ADDRESS BOTH OF THESE MAJOR SOURCES ONE BY REGULATING THE UNNECESSARY SINGLE USE PLASTIC THE AND THE FIRST TRASH THROUGH BOTH SOURCE REDUCTION AND USING TRULY RECYCLABLE AND COMPOSTABLE MATERIALS. AS WELL AS THE DOCKING THE BEST AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY TO INTERCEPT MICROFIBRES ARE FROM SHUTTING BEFORE THEY ENTER INTO THE WASTE WATER SYSTEM AND EVENTUALLY INTO THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT I EITHER ON LAND OR SEA- WE ARE PROUD SPONSORS OF AB EIGHT O. Q. BY SOME NUMBER BLAME THAT TEND TO TOPPLE- MICROFIBER FILTRATION AT THE FACILITIES AND COMMERCIAL FACILITIES. WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THIS AND THE OTHER MICROFIBER BUILD HEARD IN THE COMMITTEE- IN THE COMING MONTHS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU- I JUST LIKE TO ADDRESS NOT ONLY THE SINGLE. USE PLASTICS BUT THE- I. REUSE PLASTICS TOGETHER AND TO GET A LETTER OR ILLEGALLY DUMPED. FOR SENT. AND ILLEGALLY DUMPED THEIR- SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN FOR YOUR COMMENTS. OUR NEXT SPEAKER PLEASE. IF YOU WISH TO MAKE A COMMENT PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME AND WE'RE TO LINE TWENTY TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI GOOD AFTERNOON SHERRY MEMBERS- MY NAME'S GENEVIEVE ABDON I REPRESENT THE CLEAN P. LOBBYING COALITION IN THE CAPITAL- AND WE ARE A COALITION OF A DOZEN NOT ALMOST A DOZEN NONPROFIT THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA DEDICATED TO PLASTIC POLLUTION POLLUTION. SPECIFICALLY SOURCE REDUCTION AND REUSE- WE ARE HAPPY TO HAVE BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF HELPING TO PASS- MUCH OF THE MICROPLASTICS OF LEGISLATION MENTIONED THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON. INCLUDING DEFINING AND MEASURING MICROPLASTICS IN DRINKING WATER AND OPVS MICROPLASTICS STRATEGY WE ARE VERY GLAD TO SEE A REDUCTION IN SINGLE USE DISPOSABLE PLASTICS MENTIONED AS THE FIRST POLLUTION PREVENTION STRATEGY IN THE BACKGROUND MEMO FOR THAT HEARING. AS WE BELIEVE THAT SOURCE REDUCTION OF MACRO PLASTICS IS A HUGE PART OF. THE SOLUTION FOR- REDUCING MICROPLASTICS- MORE UPSTREAM RATHER THAN SOME OF. THE DOWNSTREAM POLLUTION. I WE ALSO- WE'RE GLAD TO CAN BUT- ON THE LAST BUT WHY TO KNOW. THAT IN AGREEMENT WITH ONE OF THE PANEL THAT IT IS A TO. PART OF THE SOLUTION BY WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT A BIG PART OF THE SOLUTION AS HOLDING PRODUCERS OF THESE POLLUTING PRODUCTS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LIFE CYCLE OF THEIR- PRODUCTS ONCE THEY PUT THEM ON THE MARKET- AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT CONSIDERED. AND WE ARE PROUD SPONSORS OF THEM- MACRO PLASTICS LEGISLATION THIS YEAR YOU- HELP REDUCE MICROPLASTIC THAT AT THE SOURCE. AND I ALSO JUST WANTED TO ADD SINCE THE LAST PRESENTER AT TERRY I WANTED TO ADD ON TO POINTS- THAT I DON'T KNOW IF CAME UP IN ANY OF THE SCIENTIFIC PANEL. BUT ONE IS THAT- BOTH MICROPLASTICS MICRO. PRODUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AS THEY BREAK DOWN A. B. HAPPY TO SEND OVER SOME OF THAT INFORMATION BUT THAT IS SOMETHING TO BE AWARE OF IN THAT- IN THIS WHOLE THING IS WE'RE LOOKING TO SOLUTION. AND ALSO WANTED TO NOTE THAT- EVEN THOUGH THE PLASTICS INDUSTRY HAS DONE A VERY GOOD JOB OF- SCARING THE PUBLIC INTO THINKING THAT- DISPOSABLES ARE SAFER TO USE DURING COLDER THAN THE REARS OF ALL. WE HAVE TO- GLOBAL HEALTH EXPERTS AND EVEN NOW AND U. S. HEALTH EXPERTS AGREEING THAT- JUST YOU KNOW AT THE LEAST AFFORDABLE THEY'RE NOT ANY SAFER THAN REASONABLE SO WE- WE- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TODAY AND- LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO DISCUSS SOLUTIONS. TO THAT BUT THE MACRO PLASTICS AND MICROPLASTICS. PROBLEM THANK YOU VERY MUCH- NEXT. THANK YOU RIGHT TWENTY THREE PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO THIS IS ANDREA VENTURA WITH CLEAN WATER ACTION I WANT TO THANK YOU CHAIRED QUIRK FOR A VERY GOOD HEARING- AND VERY INTERESTING- COM AT A PRESENTATION- I NOTICED IN. DOING AN OVERVIEW OF THE LEGISLATION THIS YEAR THAT THERE ARE YOU KNOW NUMEROUS BILLS DEALING WITH WASTE MUCH OF IT NOT ALL OF IT THAT MUCH IT PLASTIC WASTE AND WE ARE GLAD TO SEE THAT- WE OBVIOUSLY ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACTS. OF THESE MATERIALS IN OUR WATER AND ENVIRONMENT IN GENERAL- SO WE APPLAUD THAT BUT ONE THING THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO ASK THEM WHAT WE LOOK FOR IN BILLS- WITHIN THEIR PLASTIC OR ANY OTHER KIND OF- WASTE REDUCTION- THINKING. IS THAT THE FIRST OF ALL YOU KNOW EVERY BILL AND SEVERAL OF THESE DO YOU KNOW HAS TO REALLY LOOK AT SOURCE REDUCTION WE JUST HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT WE CANNOT ULTIMATELY RECYCLE OUR WAY OUT OF OUR PROBLEMS WE HAVE TO STOP USING MATERIALS- SIMPLY DISPOSABLE- AND SO WE LOOK FOR THAT IN BILLS THAT ARE THERE THINGS THAT WILL. YOU KNOW THAT CAN BE PUT INTO LEGISLATION THAT WILL HELP PROMOTE FAT THE OTHER IS THAT WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WITH ITS PLASTIC OR ANYTHING ELSE WHAT WE'RE RECYCLING ARE WE RECYCLING TOXIC CHEMICALS BACK INTO THE MARKET PLACE ARE WE JUST KEEPING THEM IN THE MARKET PLACE. AND YOU KNOW SO I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS WE ALSO LOOK FOR IS LANGUAGE THAT WILL ADDRESS THAT CERTAIN THINGS WE DON'T WANT IN THE RECYCLING- ARENA WE DON'T WANT THESE THINGS COMING BACK TO US INCLUDING OUR WATER OUR BODIES. I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT SIMPLE MESSAGE OUT TO OUR LEGISLATORS ISSUED CRAFTING LEGISLATION AS YOU'RE CONSIDERING IT- WE ARE ALWAYS HAPPY TO WEIGH IN AND PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THAT AND WE WANT TO THANK EVERYONE IN THE LEGISLATURE WHO IS. YOU KNOW REALLY LOOKING AT THESE ISSUES AND TRYING TO MOVE SOMETHING FORWARD SAID THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. TO SAY MY KEYS TO NOW. YES- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FROM WATER ACTION- I WANT TO SAY THAT YOUR POINT ABOUT RE DOT AS WELL TAKEN ALSO CAN GET SOLUTION FOR REDUCING PACKAGING PLASTICS AND PACKAGING AND EXPORT THEM AROUND THE WORLD WOULD HAVE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT- NEXT SPEAKER SHE- THANK YOU ALL RIGHT TWENTY ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CAITLYN COLUSA I AM THE POLICY MANAGER FOR THE CALIFORNIA COAST KEEPER ALLIANCE AND- THE FIRST LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU FOR HOSTING THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING AND PLACING A SPOTLIGHT ON THIS IMPORTANT INCREASING ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE. OUR ORGANIZATION FOCUSES ON- PROTECTING RESTORING WATER QUALITY AND WE ENCOURAGE MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS BE PREPARED PROGRESS THE NUMEROUS SOURCES AND PATHWAYS WITH REGARDS AFTERNOON OF THIS MICRO AND PERVASIVE- MY MACRO POLLUTION. CALIFORNIA TO PURSUE BOTH LONG AND SHORT TERM SOLUTION TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE POLLUTION. AND RELATIVES ARE OUR ORGANIZATIONS WORK WE ACTIVELY SUPPORT EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE PRESENCE OF MICROPLASTICS FROM THREE SPECIFIC PATHWAYS- ONE BEING PERMITTED DISCHARGES. SECOND BEING FOR MOTOR RUNOFF AND IN WASTE. OUR ORGANIZATION THREE HUNDRED PROTEIN CLOSE RECYCLING DIRECT OCEAN WASTE WATER DISCHARGES STORMWATER CAPTURE TREATMENTS AND THE TIMELY IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE WATER BOARD TRUST POLICY TO MANAGE THE PRESENT THE TRASH AND STORM WATER RUNOFF. AND THIRTY TO REDUCE MICROFIBERS. IN WASTE WATER. UNDER THIS YEAR WE ARE TO BE SPONSORING BILL TWO WITH A MEMBER FOR. TORE APART BILLS RATIONING OUR WASHING. AND ASSEMBLY BILL THREE TWO TWO WITH MEMBER REED. SHOULD ANSWER HARD WATER CAPTURE AND WATER CALL. POLICE ARE NOT EXHAUSTIVE BUT OF A GREATER ST ACTIONS THAT TAKE NOT REDUCE THE OF MY- POLLUTION. I'M LOOKING AT WHERE THIRTY FURTHER SO ARE. FUNDED INACTION IMPLEMENT. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. YOUR ATTENTION AFTERNOON TO THE SPECIAL. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR VERY MUCH ON TARGET- DISCUSSION. THE DO WE HAVE ANOTHER CALLER. SHE THANK YOU THE LAST COMMENT I HAVING CUTE NUMBER TWENTY TWO I'M SORRY TWENTY FOUR PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI MY NAME IS JOHN BOTHER AND I'M A LONG TERM RESIN CALIFORNIA STATE THANK YOU SO MUCH. ASIAN AND ALL THE PANELISTS FOR EDUCATING US ABOUT THE DANGERS OF PLASTICS- I THINK ONE THING I KNOW THREE PEOPLE HAD MAKE COMMENT ABOUT LANDFILLS. LANDFILL DUE TO LEACH STATE AFTER POLICE EVEN THE BEST- THE BEST REGULATIONS. SO THAT IS SOMETHING TO PLEASE CONSIDER- EVEN THE BEST LINING OVER TIME WILL BE- EVEN WHEN THEY WENT LATER DETECTED. YEAH THE REMEDIATION EITHER IS NOT DONE PROPERLY OR LONG TERM SO THERE'S THAT THAT CAN BE SOURCED FOR NOT JUST MINE MICROPLASTICS. THE CHEMICAL THAT COME. THE SECOND THING I WOULD LIKE TO TOUCH ON IS AS OTHER PEOPLE MENTIONED THE IMPORTANCE OF SOURCE REDUCTION- YOU KNOW FOR DECADES CONSUMERS HAVE BEEN BLAMED. AND CARRIED THE BILL FOR ALL THE PLASTIC ON THE PLASTIC BOTTLES AND THAT AND WHAT NOT BUT- JUST THE FACT IS THAT THE BOTTLING INDUSTRY AND PLASTIC MANUFACTURERS ARE THE ONES. WHO ARE TAKING THE PROFITS FROM IT IN AND PAYING ALL OF THIS AS CONSUMERS SO WE REALLY NEED TO WORK WITH MANUFACTURERS AND MAKING THEM- TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND TO FIND DIFFERENT. PACKAGING AND OTHER PRODUCTS- AND I DEFINITELY WANT TO SAY I YOU KNOW SUPPORT ALL THE BILLS ARE BEING MENTIONED. ABOUT THE FILTER WE HAVE TO DO SOME CONNECTS APPROACH TO NOT JUST REDUCE THE SOURCE BUT ALSO TOLD HER WHAT WE CAN. AND TALK ABOUT SORT PRODUCTION I WANT TO TOUCH ON BRIEFLY IS COMPACT HER. SO IMPACT HER NOT ONLY ARE THE BLADES PLASTIC THE CRUMB RUBBER ITSELF- THE AVERAGE YIELD IS FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS OF CRUMB RUBBER WHICH IS JUST ALL RIGHTS TIRES- NO TIRES- CONTAINED OR JUST USE TIRES TODAY CONTAIN. LEAD AND OTHER HEAVY METALS INCLUDING SIX PBT AQUINNAH WHICH IS- WHEN THE PALACE TALK ABOUT KILLING A CO HOST SALMON SO- THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT NEED TO BE REGULATED AND CONTROLLED THE RUNOFF FROM THOSE AND TO COMMEMORATE ALL RUN INTO OUR WATER SYSTEM SO. YOU KNOW FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS OF IT PER FIELD IS A LOT OF SOURCE- I THINK THAT IS THE LEGISLATIVE NOT BANNED- HUNTLEY BE EDUCATED ABOUT I- ALSO A LOT OF OTHER PARTS. IMPACT FIX. YOU CAN TAKE A MOTHER. YOU SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TO AND I FORWARD TO IN TO YOU LEGISLATION BEING PASSED IN AND- LEADING THE WAY. STOP BEING MICHAEL. AND PLASTIC. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU AND I BELIEVE FEWER THE PERSON WHO SENT US THE LETTER ON- ASTRO TURF AND- SHE GOT A LETTER- WELL FOR. OF ALL THANKS A- WHO. THE MEETING TODAY AND THANKS VERY MUCH TO BE GREAT SCIENTISTS. WHO WERE KIND ENOUGH TO GIVE US THEIR TIME AND AGAIN COMING FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY IN THE WORLD- AND AS THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS LEGISLATION ON MICROPLASTICS I KNOW AS THE CHAIR OF THE ONE OF THE COMMITTEES DEALING WITH THIS THAT IT'S GOING TO BE VERY USEFUL TO ME- AND LOOKING AT THE BILLS TO COME FORWARD AND SO. THANK YOU SO MUCH- AS A REMINDER WILL KEEP THE COMMITTEE RECORD OPEN FOR TWO WEEKS UNTIL MARCH SIXTEENTH HER ADDITIONAL WRITTEN COMMENTS. SHOULD YOU LIKE TO SUBMIT WRITTEN PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE CONTACT MY STAFF- ARE DENNIS STRADER IS PIA ESTRADA- AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK THE JOSH TUCKER PAGE BROKAW. M.
