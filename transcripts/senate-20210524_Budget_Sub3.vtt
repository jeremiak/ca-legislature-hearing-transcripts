00:07:07.393 --> 00:07:08.861
ISSUES THAT WE DON'T HAVE MUCH

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:09.862

FORWARD- MORE INFORMATION WILL

00:07:12.465 --> 00:07:14.367
NEED TO BE. PROVIDED BECAUSE

00:07:14.433 --> 00:07:15.301
THEY'RE STILL SOME OF THE

00:07:15.368 --> 00:07:16.502
ISSUES THAT WE HAD QUESTIONS

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:19.939

00:07:24.377 --> 00:07:26.712
HELP. SO AS WE GO FORWARD WE'LL

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:27.747
WE'LL FIGURE OUT IF THIS IS

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:28.948
GOING TO BE JUST A BUDGET ASK

00:07:29.015 --> 00:07:30.416
OR IF IT'S GOING TO BE MOVED A

00:07:30.483 --> 00:07:32.018
LITTLE BIT FURTHER DOWN. AS WE

00:07:32.084 --> 00:07:34.253
DEVELOP THE POLICY. ON ALL OF

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.888
OUR GOALS I THINK ARE VERY

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:36.923
ALIGNED AND BEING ABLE TO

00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:38.324

ARE AND NO MATTER THEIR PAYMENT

00:07:41.194 --> 00:07:43.629
SOURCE. BUT IT'S JUST A IN THE

00:07:43.696 --> 00:07:46.265
POLICY HOW OF THAT I THINK THAT

00:07:46.332 --> 00:07:47.333
THERE STILL ARE SOME QUESTIONS.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:53.239

THE POLICY MAKING PROCESS BUT I

00:08:00.947 --> 00:08:02.782
THINK OVERALL CONCEPTUALLY IT

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:04.250
SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE. MAKES

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:06.953
SENSE- BUT- YOU KNOW I THINK

00:08:07.019 --> 00:08:08.387

00:14:19.792 --> 00:14:20.793
CONCERNS ABOUT LOWER

00:14:20.859 --> 00:14:22.161
UTILIZATION FACT GOING ALL THE

00:14:22.228 --> 00:14:23.896

00:14:48.254 --> 00:14:50.656
SOME DIFFERENCES- SO FIRST OF

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:53.425

EXPECTING IS THAT PROJECT IS

00:15:13.178 --> 00:15:14.947
THAT SAVINGS COMING FROM-

00:15:15.014 --> 00:15:16.649
UTILIZATION AS SIMILAR TO WHAT

TWO. I OTHER YOU KNOW SOME OF

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:41.986
VENDOR TO HELP CONDUCT THE

RADIO. AND SO. YET BREEDING

00:43:45.055 --> 00:43:47.124
AGAIN HAVE A FEW KEY POINTS-

00:43:47.191 --> 00:43:49.193
FIRST WE KNOW THAT THE TIMING

00:43:49.259 --> 00:43:52.196
OF THIS- BUT THESE PROPOSED

00:43:52.262 --> 00:43:54.431
ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS THE PIECE

00:43:54.498 --> 00:43:56.233
OF THE PROPOSAL THAT OUR OUR

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.402
REVIEW OF THE COMPANY EIGHTEEN

00:43:58.469 --> 00:44:01.005
RESPONSE. REALLY APPEAR KEEN TO

00:44:01.071 --> 00:44:02.906
AN AFTER ACTION REVIEW. AN

00:44:02.973 --> 00:44:04.375
AFTER ACTION REVIEWS ARE

00:44:04.441 --> 00:44:06.643
CONDUCTED IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:09.046
A PUBLIC HEALTH EVENTS- JUST TO

00:44:09.113 --> 00:44:10.914
GIVE AN EXAMPLE- AFTER

00:44:10.981 --> 00:44:12.282
HURRICANE KATRINA AND THE

00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:13.917
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY

00:44:13.984 --> 00:44:15.619
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL CONDUCTED

00:44:15.686 --> 00:44:16.754
AN AFTER ACTION REVIEW JUST

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:21.125
FIVE- WITHIN JUST FIVE MONTHS-

00:44:21.191 --> 00:44:22.459
IT'S REALLY HELPED MEANT TO

00:44:22.526 --> 00:44:24.461
HELP THE KEY PLAYERS UNDERSTAND

00:44:24.528 --> 00:44:26.063
THE VARIOUS ACTIONS THEY TOOK

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:28.098
TO RESPOND TO THE TO THE

00:44:28.165 --> 00:44:29.566
EMERGENCY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

00:44:29.633 --> 00:44:31.468
WENT WELL WHAT DIDN'T GO WELL

00:44:31.535 --> 00:44:34.338
WHAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED. SO I

00:44:34.405 --> 00:44:37.041
AM BASED ON ON THIS- WEEK WE

00:44:37.107 --> 00:44:38.308
WOULD JUST NOTE THAT AN AFTER

00:44:38.375 --> 00:44:39.743
ACTION REVIEW IN THE CASE OF

00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:41.845
CODE NINETEEN IS BOTH CRITICAL

00:44:41.912 --> 00:44:44.581
AND VERY IPORTANT. HOWEVER WE

00:44:44.648 --> 00:44:45.616
WOULD NOTE THAT THE SCOPE OF

00:44:45.682 --> 00:44:47.251
THIS PROPOSAL SEEMS MUCH

00:44:47.317 --> 00:44:48.952
BROADER DESPITE THE VERY

00:44:49.019 --> 00:44:51.055
AGGRESSIVE TIMELINE. I'M NOT

00:44:51.121 --> 00:44:52.589
ONLY WOULD THEY BE ASSESSING

00:44:52.656 --> 00:44:53.690
THE PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE TO

00:44:53.757 --> 00:44:55.526
COVET BUT THEY WOULD ALSO BE

00:44:55.592 --> 00:44:57.294
SEEKING TAKE ANSWER A SET OF

00:44:57.361 --> 00:44:59.096
COMPLEX QUESTIONS ABOUT PUBLIC

00:44:59.163 --> 00:45:00.197
HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND

00:45:00.264 --> 00:45:02.366
RESOURCE NEEDS. AS WELL AS

00:45:02.433 --> 00:45:03.934
ASSESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF

00:45:04.001 --> 00:45:05.102
DISPARITIES WHICH WERE

00:45:05.169 --> 00:45:08.605
EXACERBATED BY COVERT NINETEEN.

00:45:08.672 --> 00:45:09.706
ANOTHER POINT WOULD MAKE ABOUT

00:45:09.773 --> 00:45:11.442
THE PROPOSAL ITSELF IS THAT

00:45:11.508 --> 00:45:12.476
THERE APPEARS TO BE SOME

00:45:12.543 --> 00:45:14.611
DUPLICATION WITH ANOTHER STUDY

00:45:14.678 --> 00:45:16.313
PROPOSED WITHIN THE HEALTH AND

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:18.916
HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. AND THE

00:45:18.982 --> 00:45:20.818
AGENCY HAS PROPOSED ONE POINT

00:45:20.884 --> 00:45:21.785
SEVEN MILLION TO CONDUCT A

00:45:21.852 --> 00:45:23.387
RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE

00:45:23.454 --> 00:45:24.822
INTERVIEW INTERSECTION OF

00:45:24.888 --> 00:45:27.057
COVETED NINETEEN AND-

00:45:27.124 --> 00:45:29.359
DISPARITIES. SO THIS IS

00:45:29.426 --> 00:45:31.195
OBVIOUSLY A VERY IMPORTANT LENS

00:45:31.261 --> 00:45:32.329
THROUGH WHICH TO VIEW THE

00:45:32.396 --> 00:45:33.997
PANDEMIC RESPONSE WE JUST WANNA

00:45:34.064 --> 00:45:35.065
MAKE SURE THERE'S NOT A LOT OF

00:45:35.132 --> 00:45:36.900
DUPLICATION AND I'M BETWEEN THE

00:45:36.967 --> 00:45:39.736
TWO EFFORTS. I'M SO THE ISSUES

00:45:39.803 --> 00:45:41.772
WE WOULD RAISE FOR LEGISLATIVE

00:45:41.839 --> 00:45:44.007
CONSIDERATION. INCLUDE THE

00:45:44.074 --> 00:45:46.577
FOLLOWING SO FIRST- WE'D

00:45:46.643 --> 00:45:47.811
SUGGEST THE LEGISLATURE

00:45:47.878 --> 00:45:50.380
CONSIDER BREAKING- THE REVIEW

00:45:50.447 --> 00:45:52.516
INTO TWO DIFFERENT STUDIES THE

00:45:52.583 --> 00:45:54.118
FIRST WOULD BE THE AFTER ACTION

00:45:54.184 --> 00:45:55.686
REVIEW IT WILL BE DONE QUICKLY

00:45:55.752 --> 00:45:56.887
IT COULD LIKELY BE DONE IN

00:45:56.954 --> 00:45:58.689
HOUSE THE COST COULD LIKELY BE

00:45:58.755 --> 00:46:01.258
ABSORBED- WITHIN THE EXISTING

00:46:01.325 --> 00:46:03.727
BUDGET- IT COULD HELP WITH NEAR

00:46:03.794 --> 00:46:08.232
NEAR TERM DECISION MAKING- AND

00:46:08.298 --> 00:46:09.299
CLOSING SOME OF THE IDENTIFIED

00:46:09.366 --> 00:46:11.668
GAPS. WE WOULD THEN SUGGEST A

00:46:11.735 --> 00:46:13.770
MOLD A MORE MULTI YEAR

00:46:13.837 --> 00:46:15.038
ASSESSMENT TO CONDUCT A

00:46:15.105 --> 00:46:16.573
COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:18.542
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS AS WELL AS

00:46:18.609 --> 00:46:20.410
RESOURCE NEEDS OF BOTH THE

00:46:20.477 --> 00:46:22.846
STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL WE ALSO

00:46:22.913 --> 00:46:24.448
WOULD SUGGEST TO TAKE IT EVEN

00:46:24.515 --> 00:46:26.450
FURTHER AND LOOK AT THE ROLE OF

00:46:26.517 --> 00:46:28.452
PUBLIC HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA AND

00:46:28.519 --> 00:46:30.420
THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. TO

00:46:30.487 --> 00:46:33.824
HELP- AT HELP DECISION MAKERS

00:46:33.891 --> 00:46:35.325
FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT THEY

00:46:35.392 --> 00:46:38.128
WANT- THE DEPARTMENT TO DO. I

00:46:38.195 --> 00:46:40.230
WOULD SUGGEST CONTRACTING OUT

00:46:40.297 --> 00:46:41.865
FOR THIS STUDY SOTHAT IT'S AN

00:46:41.932 --> 00:46:43.534
INDEPENDENT AND UNBIASED

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:45.903
ASSESSMENT. THE COST- IT

00:46:45.969 --> 00:46:47.538
DEPENDS REALLY ON THE SCOPE IT

00:46:47.604 --> 00:46:50.007
COULD SOMEONE EXCEED THREE

00:46:50.073 --> 00:46:51.108
THREE MILLION BUT WE YOU KNOW

00:46:51.175 --> 00:46:54.745
WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE PROBABLY

00:46:54.811 --> 00:46:55.312
NOT BY A LOT MORE THAN THREE

00:46:55.379 --> 00:46:56.880
MILLION- AND THEN IN THE

00:46:56.947 --> 00:46:58.248
MEANTIME THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT

00:46:58.315 --> 00:46:59.783
WANT TO CONSIDER TEMPORARY

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:01.885
FUNDING TO BOLSTER DEPARTMENT

00:47:01.952 --> 00:47:04.054
AND LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS.

00:47:04.121 --> 00:47:05.689
WE KNOW THAT THE FEDERAL

00:47:05.756 --> 00:47:07.758
FUNDING THAT IS AVAILABLE TO AT

00:47:07.824 --> 00:47:09.193
BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL

00:47:09.259 --> 00:47:11.061
IS VERY COVERT SPECIFIC RIGHT

00:47:11.128 --> 00:47:13.664
NOW AND UNLIMITED. AND WHILE A

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:15.132
COMPREHENSIVE STUDY IS UNDER

00:47:15.199 --> 00:47:16.767
WAY LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO

00:47:16.833 --> 00:47:18.535
CONSIDER TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE

00:47:18.602 --> 00:47:20.204
ALONG WITH ACCOUNTABILITY

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:21.438
MEASURES TO BOTH THE DEPARTMENT

00:47:21.505 --> 00:47:23.173
AND- LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:24.775
DEPARTMENTS TO MAINTAIN SOME OF

00:47:24.841 --> 00:47:26.677
THE STAFFING CAPABILITIES THAT

00:47:26.743 --> 00:47:27.511
HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED OVER THE

00:47:27.578 --> 00:47:29.379
LAST YEAR. AND THEN ONCE THE

00:47:29.446 --> 00:47:30.581
REVIEW IS COMPLETED THE

00:47:30.647 --> 00:47:31.682
LEGISLATURE CAN DETERMINE THE

00:47:31.748 --> 00:47:33.217
APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF ONGOING

00:47:33.283 --> 00:47:35.052
FUNDING FOR BOTH THE DEPARTMENT

00:47:35.118 --> 00:47:36.153
AND THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:38.188
DEPARTMENTS BASED ON. SORT OF

00:47:38.255 --> 00:47:40.457
THE RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES

00:47:40.524 --> 00:47:42.659
AND ANY FUTURE REQUIREMENTS. SO

00:47:42.726 --> 00:47:44.228
WE'RE SUGGESTING THAT TO ENSURE

00:47:44.294 --> 00:47:46.096
FUNDING IS AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS

00:47:46.163 --> 00:47:47.831
BOTH NEAR TERM AND LONG TERM

00:47:47.898 --> 00:47:49.399
NEEDS THE LEGISLATURE COULD NOT

00:47:49.466 --> 00:47:51.134
SET ASIDE SOME FUNDING AS PART

00:47:51.201 --> 00:47:52.903
OF THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. BUT MAKE

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:54.504
THE ALLOCATION OF THOSE FUNDS

00:47:54.571 --> 00:47:57.341
DEPENDING ON FINDINGS OF BOTH

00:47:57.407 --> 00:48:00.177
REVIEWS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:48:00.244 --> 00:48:04.147
THANK YOU VERY MUCH S. PUBLIC-

00:48:04.214 --> 00:48:05.649
WELL LOOK YOU'RE GOING TO I

00:48:05.716 --> 00:48:09.152
WOULD- AND- I WOULD SUGGEST

00:48:09.219 --> 00:48:12.689
MAYBE WAS. AN ACCIDENT THE

00:48:12.756 --> 00:48:13.257
PRESENT A NUMBER EIGHT FIRST

00:48:13.323 --> 00:48:15.592
BUT I THINK- I CERTAINLY

00:48:15.659 --> 00:48:17.027
UNDERSTAND AND I THINK IN LIGHT

00:48:17.094 --> 00:48:19.096
OF WHAT MISS PEGGY SAID AND I

00:48:19.162 --> 00:48:20.130
THINK WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT SOME

00:48:20.197 --> 00:48:21.798
OF US WAS BEEN FEELING THERE

00:48:21.865 --> 00:48:23.967
MAYBE THERE WASN'T ENOUGH OR AS

00:48:24.034 --> 00:48:24.701
MUCH AS THAT WE THOUGHT THERE

00:48:24.768 --> 00:48:27.638
WAS GOING TO BE. GIVEN THE-

00:48:27.704 --> 00:48:28.739
PANDEMIC THAT WE'VE JUST COME

00:48:28.805 --> 00:48:31.141
OUT OF AN ARM AND THE ECONOMY

00:48:31.208 --> 00:48:32.776
WITHOUT THE LACK OF INVESTMENT

00:48:32.843 --> 00:48:34.778
IN PUBLIC HEALTH PRIOR TO THE

00:48:34.845 --> 00:48:36.513
PANDEMIC AND THEN WITH THIS

00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:38.382
FIRST CHANCE WITH THE BUDGET.

00:48:38.448 --> 00:48:40.017
SO WE DO APPRECIATE THE

00:48:40.083 --> 00:48:42.019
ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO DO- A

00:48:42.085 --> 00:48:45.989
LOOK BACK AND A LOOK FORWARD-

00:48:46.056 --> 00:48:47.891
AND I THINK I THINK THAT FOR MY

00:48:47.958 --> 00:48:49.559
REMARKS ARE MORE. AND AS WE

00:48:49.626 --> 00:48:50.861
TALKED ABOUT WITH MENTAL HEALTH

00:48:50.927 --> 00:48:52.162
THERE'S A LOT OF A LOT OF GOOD

00:48:52.229 --> 00:48:53.964
PLANS FOR GOING FORWARD. BUT

00:48:54.031 --> 00:48:56.199
THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME. URGENCY

00:48:56.266 --> 00:48:57.934
NOW THAT WE THAT WE MAY BE

00:48:58.001 --> 00:49:00.504
OVERLOOKING- AND- AND SO I

00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:01.705
WOULD I WOULD I WOULD AGREE

00:49:01.772 --> 00:49:02.773
WITH MISS PETTICOAT SOUNDS LIKE

00:49:02.839 --> 00:49:04.408
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS. TAKE A

00:49:04.474 --> 00:49:06.243
GOOD LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED. BUT

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:07.878
THEN GOING FORWARD REALLY RE

00:49:07.944 --> 00:49:10.013
ENVISIONING I THINK WHAT PUBLIC

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:10.747
HEALTH IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE IN

00:49:10.814 --> 00:49:13.583
CALIFORNIA. IS A IS A REALLY

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:16.987
GOOD IDEA- ALL ASPECT PAN IF HE

00:49:17.054 --> 00:49:18.055
HAS ANY QUESTIONS BUT THEN I

00:49:18.121 --> 00:49:19.756
THINK THE BEST THAT WE CAN GO

00:49:19.823 --> 00:49:20.991
BACK AND LOOK AT. IN THE WORLD.

00:49:21.058 --> 00:49:23.727
WHAT WE ARE DOING- BUT I THINK

00:49:23.794 --> 00:49:26.797
ENOUGH. I THINK THAT I THINK

00:49:26.863 --> 00:49:28.065
WILL WILL WILL COME BACK WITH

00:49:28.131 --> 00:49:29.900
SOME IDEAS OF OUR OWN. ABOUT

00:49:29.966 --> 00:49:33.070
HOW TO PROVIDE SOME MORE

00:49:33.136 --> 00:49:33.704
ASSISTANCE. IN A MOTOR THE MORE

00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:37.074
SHORT TERM. BUT DEPEND. THANK

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:39.643
YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND-

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:41.511
SEVERAL QUESTIONS- SO FOR A

00:49:41.578 --> 00:49:44.348
FIRST OF ALL- YOU KNOW I HOPE

00:49:44.414 --> 00:49:45.615
THAT AS WE'RE TALKING WITH THIS

00:49:45.682 --> 00:49:47.484
ITEM THE PROPOSAL IS FOR THREE

00:49:47.551 --> 00:49:49.252
MILLION FOR OF YOU AND I

00:49:49.319 --> 00:49:51.221
APPRECIATE THE L. A. AS-

00:49:51.288 --> 00:49:53.357
ANALYSIS OF THAT BUT THIS IS

00:49:53.423 --> 00:49:55.192
THE PLAY ALSO THE PLACE AND I

00:49:55.258 --> 00:49:56.660
MADE REFERENCE ANNIE WE'VE IN

00:49:56.727 --> 00:49:59.096
SOME OF THE STUFF THAT WILL

00:49:59.162 --> 00:50:00.664
TALK ABOUT A LITTLE LATER WITH-

00:50:00.731 --> 00:50:03.133
SEVEN SIX AND SEVEN. IN THIS-

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.368
IN TERMS OF WHAT WE ALREADY

00:50:04.434 --> 00:50:06.370
KNOW. SO I MEAN AND LET'S AND

00:50:06.436 --> 00:50:07.838
LET'S NOT PRETEND WE DON'T KNOW

00:50:07.904 --> 00:50:09.840
THERE ARE PROBLEMS. WE ARE YOU

00:50:09.906 --> 00:50:12.442
KNOW THEIR PROBLEMS. AND TO SAY

00:50:12.509 --> 00:50:14.077
THAT WE'RE GOING TO WAIT A

00:50:14.144 --> 00:50:16.813
WHOLE YEAR. RIGHT BECAUSE WE'RE

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:18.281
TALKING ABOUT THIS BUDGET YEAR

00:50:18.348 --> 00:50:19.349
FOR THREE MILLION THAT AND

00:50:19.416 --> 00:50:20.484
WE'LL GO INTO A GENDER PROPOSAL

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:22.552
WHICH WE WON'T DECIDE UNTIL

00:50:22.619 --> 00:50:25.122
NEXT. JULY ACTUALLY LITTLE MORE

00:50:25.188 --> 00:50:25.789
THAN A YEAR AND THEN AFTER

00:50:25.856 --> 00:50:28.692
IMPLEMENTED- I THINK IS THIS

00:50:28.759 --> 00:50:31.194
DANGEROUS FRANKLY- BECAUSE WE

00:50:31.261 --> 00:50:31.895
THOUGHT THE BY THE WAY THE

00:50:31.962 --> 00:50:33.130
PANDEMIC HAS NOT GONE AWAY I

00:50:33.196 --> 00:50:34.765
MEAN. VERY HOPEFUL THINGS ARE

00:50:34.831 --> 00:50:37.067
WINDING DOWN BUT IT'S NOT GOING

00:50:37.134 --> 00:50:39.035
AWAY IN FACT. EXPECT WE HAVE

00:50:39.102 --> 00:50:40.537
OUTBREAKS OF CODED HERE AND

00:50:40.604 --> 00:50:43.306
THERE ACROSS THE COUNTRY- NOT.

00:50:43.373 --> 00:50:44.941
LIKE WHAT WE SAW LAST HOLIDAY

00:50:45.008 --> 00:50:46.877
YOU KNOW LAST JANUARY BUT- WE

00:50:46.943 --> 00:50:51.114
WERE IT'S NOT GOING AWAY. AND-

00:50:51.181 --> 00:50:53.784
SO LET ME JUST TOUCH ON SOME OF

00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:55.719
THE ISSUES THAT I THINK WE KNOW

00:50:55.786 --> 00:50:57.988
WE HAVE PROBLEMS WITH SO LET'S

00:50:58.054 --> 00:50:58.555
JUST TALK ABOUT INFORMATION

00:50:58.622 --> 00:51:01.625
TECHNOLOGY- AND THEN AGAIN I

00:51:01.691 --> 00:51:03.693
THINK THE ROLE PUBLIC HEALTH

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:06.463
ACTUALLY- I. SURE WE CAN

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:09.065
REIMAGINE IT BUT- I THINK OF A

00:51:09.132 --> 00:51:10.100
PRETTY GOOD IDEA WHAT THE ROLE

00:51:10.167 --> 00:51:11.802
PUBLIC HEALTH CENTER SOCIETY

00:51:11.868 --> 00:51:12.736
AND IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR A

00:51:12.803 --> 00:51:14.438
WHILE. AND THE QUESTION IS CAN

00:51:14.504 --> 00:51:16.606
WE EXECUTE ON THAT- I'M NOT

00:51:16.673 --> 00:51:18.175
SAYING THAT- WE CAN'T MAKE IT

00:51:18.241 --> 00:51:19.709
BETTER WE CAN'T DO SOME RE

00:51:19.776 --> 00:51:22.345
IMAGINING BUT- I THINK-

00:51:22.412 --> 00:51:23.647
INVESTING IN WHAT WE KNOW

00:51:23.713 --> 00:51:25.081
PUBLIC HEALTH IS NOW IS NOT

00:51:25.148 --> 00:51:26.483
GOING TO BE WASTED. AND WE'RE

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:27.317
NOT GONNA TURN AROUND SAY WELL

00:51:27.384 --> 00:51:28.585
THAT ACTUALLY PUBLIC HEALTH IS

00:51:28.652 --> 00:51:30.487
NEED TO DO THAT ANYMORE.

00:51:30.554 --> 00:51:31.555
CERTAINLY NOT CONTROL OF

00:51:31.621 --> 00:51:33.423
CONTAGIOUS DISEASES NOT MANAGED

00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:34.324
YOU KNOW SURVEILLANCE OF

00:51:34.391 --> 00:51:36.860
CHRONIC DISEASES- LIMITING

00:51:36.927 --> 00:51:40.063
STDS- YOU KNOW- OVERALL I MEAN

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:40.664
THERE'S JUST SO MANY THINGS

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:42.299
THAT- PUBLIC HEALTH WE KNOW

00:51:42.365 --> 00:51:44.000
WHAT SUPPOSED TO DO. SO MAY

00:51:44.067 --> 00:51:46.703
JUST GO BACK AND SO FOR

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:50.340
EXAMPLE- GOING ON- INFORMATION

00:51:50.407 --> 00:51:53.944
TECHNOLOGY- YEAH SO WE KNOW

00:51:54.010 --> 00:51:56.913
THAT CAL READY- ESSENTIALLY

00:51:56.980 --> 00:52:00.016
COLLAPSED MID YEAR- WE ALSO

00:52:00.083 --> 00:52:01.952
KNOW WE HAVE TO VASTLY RAMP UP

00:52:02.018 --> 00:52:05.755
OUR VACCINE- OR ITS MUSICIAN

00:52:05.822 --> 00:52:07.824
REGISTRY WHICH BY THE WAY- I

00:52:07.891 --> 00:52:09.025
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S READY TO

00:52:09.092 --> 00:52:11.161
PROVIDE VERIFICATIONS ARE NOT-

00:52:11.228 --> 00:52:12.362
BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO BE AN

00:52:12.429 --> 00:52:15.799
ISSUE GOING FORWARD. AS WELL-

00:52:15.866 --> 00:52:17.968
AND- SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO ME

00:52:18.034 --> 00:52:20.337
ABOUT HOW ROBUST THOSE SYSTEMS

00:52:20.403 --> 00:52:22.639
ARE AND ALSO HOW WELL ARE WE

00:52:22.706 --> 00:52:24.341
ABLE TO INTERFACE BETWEEN NOT

00:52:24.407 --> 00:52:26.142
ONLY OUR LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH

00:52:26.209 --> 00:52:28.011
AGENCIES WITH THE STATE AND

00:52:28.078 --> 00:52:29.946
THEIR REGISTRIES BUT ALSO WITH

00:52:30.013 --> 00:52:32.148

00:52:34.384 --> 00:52:35.785
STORIES ABOUT PEOPLE HAVING A

00:52:35.852 --> 00:52:37.821
FAX INFORMATION OVER AND THEN

00:52:37.888 --> 00:52:39.189
INFORMATION BEING MANUALLY

00:52:39.256 --> 00:52:41.057
ENTERED INTO SYSTEMS AGAIN

00:52:41.124 --> 00:52:43.460
TYING UP RESOURCES TIME WORK

00:52:43.527 --> 00:52:46.563
FORCE AT CETERA- BUT IF THOSE

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:48.164
ISSUES GONE AWAY OR THEY'RE

00:52:48.231 --> 00:52:52.068
STILL HERE BECAUSE THOSE ARE

00:52:52.135 --> 00:52:52.636
CERTAINLY TO ME THINGS WHICH

00:52:52.702 --> 00:52:54.404
IT'S OFF RIGHT NOW. CENTER PAN

THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THOSE

00:52:55.472 --> 00:52:57.140
QUESTIONS AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY

00:52:57.207 --> 00:52:58.341
RIGHT THAT THOSE ISSUES HAVE

00:52:58.408 --> 00:53:00.544
NOT GONE AWAY WE HAVE BEEN

00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:02.946
FORTUNATE TO GET. EMERGENCY

00:53:03.013 --> 00:53:04.915
FUNDING FROM THE STATE BUT ALSO

00:53:04.981 --> 00:53:06.550
FEDERAL FUNDING FOR A LOT OF

00:53:06.616 --> 00:53:07.484
THE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT'S

00:53:07.551 --> 00:53:09.586
COMING DOWN IS BEING USED TO

00:53:09.653 --> 00:53:13.323
ADDRESS THOSE. ISSUES AND SO WE

00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:14.357

AND IN A VERY FOCUSED WAY. IT'S

00:53:21.798 --> 00:53:23.199
A LONGER TERM ISSUES THAT ARE

00:53:23.266 --> 00:53:25.001
GOING TO BE REALLY CRITICAL AND

00:53:25.068 --> 00:53:26.136
IT IS GOING TO REQUIRE IT IS

00:53:26.202 --> 00:53:27.504
GOING TO REQUIRE- MORE

00:53:27.571 --> 00:53:29.639
ASSESSMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:53:29.706 --> 00:53:30.507
THE INVESTMENTS WE MAKE ARGAN

00:53:30.574 --> 00:53:32.475
ARGAN INC. ARGAN BENEFIT US

00:53:32.542 --> 00:53:34.144
DOWN YOU KNOW FIVE TEN YEARS

00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:35.178
FROM NOW BUT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY

00:53:35.245 --> 00:53:38.615

PRIMARILY. RESTRICTED TO KOVIN.

00:53:44.487 --> 00:53:46.556
RELATED THEY ARE IN A THINK I

00:53:46.623 --> 00:53:47.390
MEAN THE THAT WE SEE OF THE WAY

00:53:47.457 --> 00:53:49.292
THAT WE THINK ABOUT IT IS THAT.

00:53:49.359 --> 00:53:50.894
YOU KNOW WE WERE USING WERE

00:53:50.961 --> 00:53:52.963
USING THE COLORS FUNDING TO

00:53:53.029 --> 00:53:54.364
REALLY TO BUILD OUR CURRENT

00:53:54.431 --> 00:53:56.633
INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE RESPONSE.

00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:57.400
YOU KNOW WE'RE BUILDING FOR

00:53:57.467 --> 00:53:58.668
EXAMPLE THE CAL READY WYCHECK

00:53:58.735 --> 00:54:00.470
CAL READY HANDLES NOT JUST

00:54:00.537 --> 00:54:02.505
CULTIVATING HANDLES. READY FOR

00:54:02.572 --> 00:54:04.641
ALL COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. THE

00:54:04.708 --> 00:54:06.643
CARE REGISTRY HANDLES NOT JUST

00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:08.445
A COVERT FAXING BACKS NATIONS

00:54:08.511 --> 00:54:10.680
BUT IT HANDLES- VACCINATIONS

00:54:10.747 --> 00:54:12.382
FOR ALL ALL ALL. ALL THE

00:54:12.449 --> 00:54:14.150
EXHIBITIONS FOR THE STATE AND

00:54:14.217 --> 00:54:16.152
SO IT IT'S SORT OF A- A CO

00:54:16.219 --> 00:54:17.554
BENEFIT OR DUAL PURPOSE WERE

00:54:17.621 --> 00:54:18.521
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS

00:54:18.588 --> 00:54:19.990
FUNDING. TO REALLY TO REALLY

00:54:20.056 --> 00:54:21.558
IMPROVE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE BUT

00:54:21.625 --> 00:54:23.460
WE RECOGNIZE YOU KNOW PART OF

00:54:23.526 --> 00:54:24.728
IT WE RECOGNIZE IT COST A LOT

00:54:24.794 --> 00:54:25.962
OF MONEY AND WE WANT TO MAKE

00:54:26.029 --> 00:54:27.197
SURE THAT WE DO WE DO IT RIGHT.

00:54:27.263 --> 00:54:29.032
WE DO IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT

00:54:29.099 --> 00:54:30.433
REALLY LOOKS TO THE FUTURE

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:31.267
BECAUSE THE OTHER THING WE

00:54:31.334 --> 00:54:32.302
REALLY NEED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE

00:54:32.369 --> 00:54:34.170
OF. IS HOW WE WORK MORE CLOSELY

00:54:34.237 --> 00:54:36.039
WITH THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS.

00:54:36.106 --> 00:54:37.273
ONE OF THE BIG CHALLENGES WE'VE

00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:40.076
HAD. IS ACTUALLY- YOU KNOW THE

00:54:40.143 --> 00:54:41.211
WAY PUBLIC HEALTH WORKS IS THAT

00:54:41.277 --> 00:54:42.779
WE GET WE GET DATA FROM THE

00:54:42.846 --> 00:54:43.847
HELP WE GET DATA FROM A

00:54:43.913 --> 00:54:45.248
LABORATORY AND- HOUSE IS

00:54:45.315 --> 00:54:46.449
REPORTING TO US TO GO INTO OUR

00:54:46.516 --> 00:54:48.251
CAL READY. BUT SORT OF THE

00:54:48.318 --> 00:54:49.853
MODERN APPROACH REALLY TAKES

00:54:49.919 --> 00:54:51.221
ADVANTAGE OF HEALTH INFORMATION

00:54:51.287 --> 00:54:52.455
EXCHANGES AND WORKING WITH

00:54:52.522 --> 00:54:54.157
HEALTH SYSTEMS. AND BEING ABLE

00:54:54.224 --> 00:54:55.492
TO GET REAL TIME DATA ACROSS

00:54:55.558 --> 00:54:57.127
THE STATE NOT DEPENDING ON

00:54:57.193 --> 00:54:58.862
PEOPLE TO REPORT TO US. SO WE

00:54:58.928 --> 00:55:03.800
HAVE. TO REALLY THINK ABOUT.

00:55:03.867 --> 00:55:04.401
THAT FUTURE SOLUTION THAT ARE

00:55:04.467 --> 00:55:06.670
MUCH. EASILY AND APPARENTLY ASK

00:55:06.736 --> 00:55:08.672

YEAR. BEFORE WE START WORKING

00:55:29.459 --> 00:55:31.061
ON THIS I MEAN EIGHT BLACK

WEB BASED INTERFACE THAT PEOPLE

CLINIC THAT ALLOWS CLINICS TO

01:00:29.592 --> 01:00:30.827
ACTUALLY JUST RUN OUT THE WHOLE

01:00:30.893 --> 01:00:32.295
CREDIT CAN DO APPOINTMENTS. AND

SO THOSE EARLY SO I JUST

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:35.231
MENTIONED FIVE DIFFERENT

01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:37.133
SYSTEMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY-

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:39.502
DIRECTLY FOCUSING ON CO THEY DO

01:00:39.569 --> 01:00:42.338
OVERLAP BECAUSE- MY CARING CAL

01:00:42.405 --> 01:00:42.805
READY DEAL WITH OTHER

01:00:42.872 --> 01:00:45.074
COMMUNITIES. SO BUT BUT- YOU

01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:52.915
KNOW AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE.

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:53.383
OVERALL PUBLIC HEALTH

01:00:53.449 --> 01:00:53.983
INFRASTRUCTURE. THOSE ARE THE

01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:54.817
ONES AND WE HAVE A MANY. THAT

01:00:54.884 --> 01:00:58.121
ALSO LIKE. AND FOR- THAT WOULD

01:00:58.187 --> 01:01:00.289
BE A- SYSTEMS OUT THERE CANCER

01:01:00.356 --> 01:01:01.958
REGISTRIES- YOU KNOW ABOUT US

01:01:02.025 --> 01:01:03.292
REGISTRY OUT THERE ARE VARIOUS

01:01:03.359 --> 01:01:04.894
REGISTRIES YELLS AT THE NEWBORN

01:01:04.961 --> 01:01:06.029
SCREENING WE JUST TALKED ABOUT

01:01:06.095 --> 01:01:08.264
YOU KNOW DATA ETCETERA AND-

01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:09.699
EVEN LIKE CHRONIC DISEASE

01:01:09.766 --> 01:01:10.733
SURVEILLANCE WAS GONNA BE VERY

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.101
IMPORTANT TO FIGURE OUT THINGS

01:01:12.168 --> 01:01:13.703
LIKE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:16.105
OTHER TYPES OF ISSUES AS WELL-

01:01:16.172 --> 01:01:20.476
THAT- THAT FRANKLY I THINK- WE

01:01:20.543 --> 01:01:21.077
HAVEN'T BEEN FUNDING VERY MUCH

01:01:21.144 --> 01:01:24.313
CORRECT- I. WILL HAVE TO LOOK

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:25.548
AT THAT SPECIFICALLY BUT YOU'RE

01:01:25.615 --> 01:01:26.949
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT YOU TAKE A

01:01:27.016 --> 01:01:28.718
VITAL RECORDS CANCER REGISTRY

01:01:28.785 --> 01:01:30.353
AND THEY DON'T THINK OF. THE

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:31.754
DATABASES ACROSS THE STATE

01:01:31.821 --> 01:01:33.222
BECAUSE EACH JURISDICTION HAS

01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:34.624
OUR OWN SYSTEM FOR COLLECTING

01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:36.793
DATA. AND THEN THE INTO COULD

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:38.294
THE COMMUNICATIONS WITHOUT THE

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:39.495
LACK THE CLINICAL LABORATORY

01:01:39.562 --> 01:01:40.496
LABORATORIES IN THE PUBLIC

01:01:40.563 --> 01:01:42.865
HEALTH LABORATORY OKAY SO AND-

01:01:42.932 --> 01:01:43.933
I KNOW WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.401
ALL DAY BUT I'M- OKAY LET'S

01:01:45.468 --> 01:01:47.203
MOVE ON TO AND SO IT CLEARLY

01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:49.038
NEEDS A LOT MORE WORK. I

01:01:49.105 --> 01:01:49.939
APPRECIATE THAT THERE IS

01:01:50.006 --> 01:01:51.140
FUNDING COMING DOWN BUT IT'S

01:01:51.207 --> 01:01:52.708
VERY FOCUSED TOWARD COVERT

01:01:52.775 --> 01:01:53.609
RELATED ONES AND THERE'S A LOT

01:01:53.676 --> 01:01:56.479
OF OTHER ONES- STACK THE STAFF

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:59.615

01:01:59.682 --> 01:02:00.850

MORE LOCAL STAFF I KNOW- THAT-

01:02:09.325 --> 01:02:11.894
ALSO- EXAMPLE I UNDERSTAND

01:02:11.961 --> 01:02:13.429
THAT- WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF

01:02:13.496 --> 01:02:14.997
STAFF IN OUR LABS AND TIES A

01:02:15.064 --> 01:02:16.365
LITTLE BIT TO OUR LAB CAPACITY

01:02:16.432 --> 01:02:17.533
AND WE NEED A PIPE BUILD THE

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:23.372
PIPELINE FOR TRAINING PEOPLE.

01:02:23.439 --> 01:02:26.442

TALK ABOUT PIPELINE FOR

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:38.521
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FIVE POINT

BECAUSE NOW YOU KNOW THAT'S A

01:02:50.633 --> 01:02:52.568
CRISIS BUT- EVEN DURING REGULAR

01:02:52.635 --> 01:02:53.703
TIMES UNDERSTAND THAT DOOR LABS

01:02:53.769 --> 01:02:54.770
THAT CLOSE BECAUSE THEY CAN

01:02:54.837 --> 01:02:56.739
HIRED PERSONNEL THEY NEEDED

01:02:56.806 --> 01:02:57.206
THAT YOU CAN GET A LAB

01:02:57.273 --> 01:03:00.643
DIRECTOR. YEAH THE- THE

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:02.545
LABORATORY THE LABORATORY A

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:03.779
LABORATORY HAS VERY SPECIAL

01:03:03.846 --> 01:03:06.549
ISSUES RELATED TO HOW LABS RUN.

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:07.917
AND THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE

01:03:07.984 --> 01:03:09.485
HIGH LEVEL OF TRAINING FOR THE

01:03:09.552 --> 01:03:11.120
FOR THE DIRECTORS. AND THEN THE

01:03:11.187 --> 01:03:12.788
MICRO BY BIOLOGISTS OFTEN TIMES

01:03:12.855 --> 01:03:13.723
THEY GET RECRUITED TO THE

01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:14.991
PRIVATE SECTOR WHERE THEY CAN

01:03:15.057 --> 01:03:17.160
EARN SOME EXTRA MONEY. AND SO

01:03:17.226 --> 01:03:18.861
IT'S EASIER TO BRING THE MAN

01:03:18.928 --> 01:03:20.730
IT'S HARDER TO GET STARTED. TO

01:03:20.796 --> 01:03:22.565
KEEP THEM- IN TERMS OF HAPPY

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:24.634

ASSISTANCE FROM A DISTANCE

01:03:38.314 --> 01:03:38.915
BECAUSE SOME OF THIS CAN

01:03:38.981 --> 01:03:40.249
ACTUALLY BE A PROVIDED FROM

01:03:40.316 --> 01:03:41.551
JUST SOMETIMES ANY FIELD TEAMS

01:03:41.617 --> 01:03:42.919
ANY PEOPLE IN THE FIELD. WHAT I

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:46.455
ANALYTIC POWER- THAT CAN BE

01:03:46.522 --> 01:03:47.757
DONE THAT CAN BE DONE TO

01:03:47.823 --> 01:03:48.925
DISTANCE. AND THEN THE LAST

01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:50.059
AREA I WANT TO MENTION THAT'S

01:03:50.126 --> 01:03:51.227
REALLY CRITICAL FOR PUBLIC

01:03:51.294 --> 01:03:52.962
HEALTH WORKFORCE. IS THAT WE

01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:54.764
REALLY DO NEED TO RECRUIT RICK

01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:57.033
RECRUIT IN OUR ACROSS OUR

01:03:57.099 --> 01:03:58.301
PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEMS ACROSS

01:04:02.972 --> 01:04:04.373
COMMUNITY AND CREATE PATHWAYS

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:05.808
SO THAT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES

01:04:05.875 --> 01:04:07.510
AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. ACTUALLY

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:09.045
HAVE A PATHWAY TO ENSURE THE

01:04:09.111 --> 01:04:11.180
PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE. PUBLIC

01:04:11.247 --> 01:04:13.115
HEALTH WORK FORCE HAS A LARGE

01:04:13.182 --> 01:04:14.550
WE ARE WE REALLY DON'T HAVE

01:04:14.617 --> 01:04:15.985
ENOUGH PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THE

01:04:16.052 --> 01:04:17.086
PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE AT ALL

01:04:17.153 --> 01:04:18.421
LEVELS SO WE NEED TO. FIGURE

01:04:18.487 --> 01:04:19.855
OUT HOW TO IMPROVE THAT OKAY I

THIS IS WAIT- OUR SHORE OF

01:04:32.501 --> 01:04:34.036
LAUGHTER PASSAGE- WAS. IN THERE

01:04:34.103 --> 01:04:35.471
ARE OTHER I THINK CONCERN AS

01:04:35.538 --> 01:04:37.473

TO KEEP UP I DO APPRECIATE THE

01:04:39.208 --> 01:04:40.243
GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP AND

01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:41.877
STANDING UP THE VALENCIA LAB

01:04:41.944 --> 01:04:43.512
EVENTUALLY BUT THAT THAT WAS

01:04:43.579 --> 01:04:44.680
THAT WAS A MAJOR ISSUE FOR

01:04:44.747 --> 01:04:48.351
PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS- THE-

01:04:48.417 --> 01:04:50.753
ALSO- OUR ABILITY TO CONTACT

01:04:52.054 --> 01:04:56.325
AGAIN BY LACK OF STAFF. AS

01:04:56.392 --> 01:04:59.762

THE WAY I WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE

01:05:05.768 --> 01:05:07.937

01:13:24.166 --> 01:13:25.567
I'M TRYING TO MAKE AND SAID. A

01:13:25.634 --> 01:13:26.835

THAT I THINK THERE MIGHT BE. IF

01:14:51.954 --> 01:14:55.324
A BIT OF CONFUSION ABOUT THE-

01:14:55.390 --> 01:14:57.259

LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. TO

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:40.102
ADDRESS SOME OF THE VERY ISSUES

01:15:40.168 --> 01:15:41.970
THAT YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

01:15:42.037 --> 01:15:45.407
WHILE AT PERHAPS A MORE LENGTHY

01:15:45.474 --> 01:15:47.042
STUDY CAN TAKE PLACE TO

01:15:47.109 --> 01:15:48.810
DETERMINE WHAT THE IT'S SORT OF

01:15:48.877 --> 01:15:50.579
HARD TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE

01:15:50.646 --> 01:15:52.214
APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF FUNDING

01:15:52.281 --> 01:15:54.449
IS FOR THINGS LIKE STAFFING AND

01:15:54.516 --> 01:15:56.218
PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:15:56.285 --> 01:15:58.320
SO OUR SUGGESTION WAS SOME SOME

01:15:58.387 --> 01:15:59.888
AMOUNT OF TEMPORARY FUNDING

01:15:59.955 --> 01:16:02.557
RIGHT AWAY. COUPLED WITH THE

01:16:02.624 --> 01:16:05.227
LONGER TERM- ASSESSMENT TO SEE

01:16:05.294 --> 01:16:08.864
WHAT THE LONG TERM ONGOING

01:16:08.931 --> 01:16:10.799
INVESTMENT SHOULD BE. OKAY AND

01:16:10.866 --> 01:16:12.234
THEN ONE OF COME IN A MOVIE

01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:13.201
BECAUSE I'D DIE I THINK BUT

01:16:13.268 --> 01:16:15.938
MISTAKES IT IS WHAT I SAID. IN

01:16:16.004 --> 01:16:19.574
THE BEGINNING- SO. AND I WOULD

01:16:19.641 --> 01:16:21.076
JUST SAY EIGHT THIRTY ARE GONE

01:16:21.143 --> 01:16:22.644
I THINK YOU HEAR FRUSTRATION

01:16:22.711 --> 01:16:23.845
BECAUSE I WE'VE ALL LIVED

01:16:23.912 --> 01:16:26.548
THROUGH THIS- PANDEMIC AND

01:16:26.615 --> 01:16:28.183
PEOPLE LIKE MAKE ME MOVE

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:29.584
REPRESENTED AN AREA WITH A LOT

01:16:29.651 --> 01:16:31.486
OF AGRICULTURE WHEN I THINK

01:16:31.553 --> 01:16:32.788
BACK TO JUST BEGINNING AND

01:16:32.854 --> 01:16:34.823
TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TESTED AND

01:16:34.890 --> 01:16:36.358
BIG OUTBREAKS AND FARMS AND I

01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:38.260
MEAN IT WAS A NIGHTMARE IT WAS

01:16:38.327 --> 01:16:40.362
A NIGHTMARE PARTLY BECAUSE- OF%

01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:41.997
THE STATE THE STATE WAS PART OF

01:16:42.064 --> 01:16:43.065
THE NIGHTMARE THAT WE COULDN'T

01:16:43.131 --> 01:16:45.567
GET. FLOWS OF DATA THERE WAS

01:16:45.634 --> 01:16:47.970
CONFUSION AROUND TESTING WHO IS

01:16:48.036 --> 01:16:50.305
RESPONSIBLE SO I THINK PART OF

01:16:50.372 --> 01:16:51.340
WHAT YOU'RE HEARING TODAY IS

01:16:51.406 --> 01:16:53.041
THE FRUSTRATION OF WHAT WE'VE

01:16:53.108 --> 01:16:55.610
BEEN THROUGH AND THEN THE

01:16:55.677 --> 01:16:56.678
FEELING PERHAPS OF THE LACK OF

01:16:56.745 --> 01:16:59.348
URGENCY TO ATTACK IT RIGHT NOW

01:16:59.414 --> 01:17:01.283
HOME WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT

01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:03.185
EVERYTHING HAS BEEN- FEELING

01:17:03.251 --> 01:17:04.219
LIKE IT'S ON THE BOTTOM OF A

01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:05.721
WATERFALL AND SOMETIMES IT'S

01:17:05.787 --> 01:17:07.923
HARD TO GET A BREATH- BUT WHY

01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:09.658
DON'T WE HAVE MAYBE MISSED IN

01:17:09.725 --> 01:17:10.559

WE CAN- YOU KNOW PRODUCE

01:59:48.180 --> 01:59:49.448
COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION.

01:59:49.515 --> 01:59:51.817
EVALUATIVE COMPONENT- SIMILAR

01:59:51.884 --> 01:59:53.052
TO WHAT WE WERE THINKING

01:59:53.119 --> 01:59:55.221

DONE A LITTLE OVER EIGHTY

02:22:11.322 --> 02:22:12.991
