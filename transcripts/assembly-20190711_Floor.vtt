MEMBERS MAKE NO MISTAKE HOUSING

01:01:06.462 --> 01:01:08.965
AB TEN FIFTY FOUR IS A PIVOTAL

01:01:09.032 --> 01:01:11.067
STEP BUT IT IS NOT THE LAST STEP.

01:01:11.134 --> 01:01:12.435
WE STILL HAVE MANY MORE ISSUES

01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:14.137
TO CONTEND WITH.

01:01:14.203 --> 01:01:15.138
THERE ARE THOSE IN THIS ROOM WHO

01:01:15.204 --> 01:01:16.139
HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE

01:01:16.205 --> 01:01:17.407
ADMINISTRATION ABOUT WHAT TO DO

01:01:17.473 --> 01:01:19.242

01:01:19.842 --> 01:01:20.743
VICTIMS.

01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:22.111
THOSE WHO WISH TO RETURN TO

01:01:22.178 --> 01:01:23.379
THEIR HOMES AND HOW BEST TO

01:01:23.446 --> 01:01:25.448
ADDRESS THINGS LIFE RELIEF FOR

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:26.716
AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY LARGE

01:01:26.783 --> 01:01:29.185
ENERGY USERS HOME HARDENING.

01:01:29.252 --> 01:01:30.586
UNDER INSURANCE ASSURANCE

01:01:30.653 --> 01:01:32.955
AVAILABILITY ALL STILL WITH EYES

01:01:33.022 --> 01:01:34.624
TOWARDS THE TWO THOUSAND

01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:35.691
SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN VICTIMS.

01:01:35.758 --> 01:01:36.993
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HAS BEEN

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:38.961
OPEN TO THOSE ISSUES ITEMS AND

01:01:39.028 --> 01:01:39.796
WE WILL BE CONTINUING TO HAVE

01:01:39.862 --> 01:01:40.696
THOSE CONVERSATIONS OVER THE

01:01:40.763 --> 01:01:43.433
NEXT FEW WEEKS. FOR THOSE WHO

01:01:43.499 --> 01:01:44.667
SAY WHY NOW [inaudible]

01:01:44.734 --> 01:01:46.903
WHY TODAY?

01:01:46.969 --> 01:01:48.004
I SAY I HAVE SEEN THE COST OF

01:01:48.071 --> 01:01:50.006
INACTION.

01:01:50.073 --> 01:01:50.506
AND WE HAVE ALL SEEN THE

01:01:50.573 --> 01:01:52.442
DEVASTATION.

01:01:52.508 --> 01:01:53.609
I'VE SAID ALL ALONG WITH THE

01:01:53.676 --> 01:01:54.844
FOCUS OF OUR EFFORT SHOULD BE ON

01:01:54.911 --> 01:01:57.513
THE PAST FEW AND FUTURE VICTIMS.

01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:58.614
AND I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO

01:01:58.681 --> 01:02:00.450
APOLOGIZE TO THOSE WHO LOST

01:02:00.516 --> 01:02:01.017
THEIR HOMES AND THEIR FAMILY

01:02:01.084 --> 01:02:02.819
MEMBERS.

01:02:02.885 --> 01:02:04.053
THESE ARE BURDENS THAT WE ALL

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:05.855
PAY FOR NOT TAKING PREVENTIVE

01:02:05.922 --> 01:02:07.023
MEASURES THAT WE SHOULD HAVE

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:10.226
DEMANDED LONG IN ADVANCE.

01:02:10.293 --> 01:02:11.027
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

01:02:11.094 --> 01:02:12.829
TESTIFIED OVER THE LAST FEW

01:02:12.895 --> 01:02:14.197
WEEKS AND MONTHS WHO HAVE BEEN

01:02:14.263 --> 01:02:15.998
OUT OF THEIR HOME FOR OR TWO

01:02:16.065 --> 01:02:18.401
OVER FOURTEEN HUNDRED DAYS.

01:02:18.468 --> 01:02:19.669
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE

01:02:19.735 --> 01:02:21.504
PHONE WITH THEIR LOVED ONES.

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:24.240
FORCED TO LISTEN AS THE FIRE

01:02:24.307 --> 01:02:24.607
OVERTOOK THEM.

01:02:24.674 --> 01:02:26.309
AND ENDED THEIR LIVES.

01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:28.010
WE BEAR SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR

01:02:28.077 --> 01:02:28.711
THAT.

01:02:28.778 --> 01:02:29.979
AND TO NOT ACT TODAY WOULD BE

01:02:30.046 --> 01:02:32.215
UNCONSCIONABLE.

01:02:32.281 --> 01:02:34.917
SO WE MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE

01:02:34.984 --> 01:02:35.518
TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA TO

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:36.919
TAKE ACTION.

01:02:36.986 --> 01:02:38.588
AND THIS IS AN ACTION IN WHICH

01:02:38.654 --> 01:02:40.123
WE REQUIRE ACCOUNTABILITY NOT

01:02:40.189 --> 01:02:41.324
JUST FROM US BUT FROM THE

01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:42.525
UTILITIES ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:44.327
BEHAVE POORLY.

01:02:44.393 --> 01:02:46.362
A LOT HAS GONE INTO THIS.

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:47.897
I WANT TO THANK THE JOINT AND CO

01:02:47.964 --> 01:02:48.965
AUTHORS FOR THEIR DEDICATION

01:02:49.031 --> 01:02:50.600
OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF TO

01:02:50.666 --> 01:02:52.335
AN ISSUE THAT HAS NO SIMPLE OR

01:02:52.401 --> 01:02:54.270
EASY SOLUTION.

01:02:54.337 --> 01:02:55.771
YES THIS FINAL PRODUCT IS FAIRLY

01:02:55.838 --> 01:02:57.073
NEW BUT WE HAVE SPENT COUNTLESS

01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:59.108
HOURS DAYS AND WEEKS AND MONTHS

01:02:59.175 --> 01:03:02.578
WORKING ON THESE ISSUES. THIRTY

EFFORT IN THIS YOU ARE WRONG.

01:03:08.518 --> 01:03:09.952
MEMBERS I WENT TO PARIS AND SAW

01:03:10.019 --> 01:03:11.821
THE DEVASTATION I SAW YOUNG KIDS

01:03:11.888 --> 01:03:13.022
WERE NOT ONLY RECOVERING FROM

01:03:13.089 --> 01:03:14.724
TRAUMA BUT ALSO AFRAID THEY WILL

01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:16.225
NEVER GO BACK HOME.

01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:19.128
IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US TO ACT.

01:03:19.195 --> 01:03:19.695
THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT

01:03:19.762 --> 01:03:20.863
DIRECTION.

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:22.632
THIS IS OUR JOB.

01:03:22.698 --> 01:03:23.966
WE WERE SENT TO SACRAMENTO TO

01:03:24.033 --> 01:03:25.735
MAKE HARD DECISIONS.

01:03:25.801 --> 01:03:27.069
I KNOW THIS WON'T BE AN EASY

01:03:27.136 --> 01:03:28.137
VOTE FOR SOME OF YOU.

01:03:28.204 --> 01:03:30.339
BUT IT IS THE RIGHT.

01:03:30.406 --> 01:03:30.973
ONE IT'S A VOTE THE CAN PROTECT

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:32.141
THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA

01:03:32.208 --> 01:03:33.342
BECOMING VICTIMS NOT ONLY THE

01:03:33.409 --> 01:03:34.844
DEVASTATION AND DESTRUCTION THE

01:03:34.911 --> 01:03:36.145
WILDFIRES CAN CAUSE.

01:03:36.212 --> 01:03:37.813
BUT THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:40.049
UTILITY COSTS AS WELL I

01:03:40.116 --> 01:03:42.351
RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN IBM.

STATE.

01:03:53.262 --> 01:03:54.697
I BELIEVE THAT WE AS POLICY

01:03:54.764 --> 01:03:56.199
MAKERS MUST HAVE AT LEAST THREE

01:03:56.265 --> 01:03:57.934
PRIORITIES TO GUIDE US AS WE

OF CORPORATE EXECUTIVES WHO MADE

01:04:16.852 --> 01:04:17.887

EXPERIENCING THESE MEGA FIRES.

01:04:21.991 --> 01:04:23.726
THIS LEGISLATION STRIKES AS

HOWEVER WE MUST NOT LOSE SIGHT

01:04:35.504 --> 01:04:37.240
OF HOW ENERGY PRICES INSTABILITY

01:04:37.306 --> 01:04:39.609

SUPPORT SB NINE A ONE LAST YEAR

01:05:31.627 --> 01:05:35.031
I RISE TO SPEAK ON AB. TEN FIFTY

DEVASTATION TO MY DISTRICT ON A

01:05:38.701 --> 01:05:39.702
SCALE THAT HAD NEVER BEEN SEEN

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:41.203
BEFORE.

01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:42.171
BUT THAT WAS JUST ONE OF

01:05:42.238 --> 01:05:43.939
NUMEROUS FIRES THAT HAS CHANGED

01:05:44.006 --> 01:05:45.675
THE WAY WE LIVE.

01:05:45.741 --> 01:05:47.176
WHEN THE ISSUE OF WILDFIRES AND

01:05:47.243 --> 01:05:48.978
NATURAL DISASTERS CAME BEFORE US

01:05:49.045 --> 01:05:50.713
ON THE FLOOR?

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.048
I FIND MYSELF THINKING OF THE

01:05:52.114 --> 01:05:53.316
COUNTLESS VICTIMS THAT HAVE YET

01:05:53.382 --> 01:05:55.217
TO BE MADE WHOLE.

01:05:55.284 --> 01:05:57.253
WHEN I TAKE THESE VOTES I THINK

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:58.421
OF THE VICTIMS?

01:05:58.487 --> 01:06:00.656

HOLDING UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE.

01:07:03.786 --> 01:07:05.388
KNOWN MY COMMUNITY WITHOUT

01:07:05.454 --> 01:07:06.989
WILDFIRES WHICH MEANS THAT IS

01:07:07.056 --> 01:07:09.024
ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE WE

01:07:09.091 --> 01:07:10.559
EXPERIENCE THE DESTRUCTION OF

01:07:10.626 --> 01:07:12.762
ANOTHER. ONE FOR THIS REASON I

01:07:12.828 --> 01:07:14.764
DO NOT TAKE THIS VOTE LIGHTLY.

01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:19.468
SINCE DECEMBER FOURTH OF TWENTY

INDIVIDUAL CONVERSATION.

01:07:29.578 --> 01:07:31.113
THIS MEANS WHAT THIS MEANS FOR

01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:32.548
MY DISTRICT AND THE ENTIRE STATE

01:07:32.615 --> 01:07:34.483
NOT ONLY TO DATE AND FOR YEARS

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:35.618
TO COME IS IMPORTANT IN MY

01:07:35.684 --> 01:07:37.286
DELIBERATION.

01:07:37.353 --> 01:07:39.054
THIS BILL PROVIDES FUTURE WHILE

01:07:39.121 --> 01:07:41.857
FIRE VICTIMS BETTER CONFIDENCE

01:07:41.924 --> 01:07:43.526
THAT DESPITE THE LOSS AND

01:07:43.592 --> 01:07:45.494
DEVASTATION THERE IS RELIEF

01:07:45.561 --> 01:07:47.663
AVAILABLE TO HELP THEM GET BACK

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:47.997

WE WANT TO PROTECT RATE PAYERS

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:18.294

01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:28.938
IMPORTANT THAT WE THAT WE DO

01:08:29.004 --> 01:08:30.072
THIS.

01:08:30.139 --> 01:08:32.107
IT'S A HUGE STEP FORWARD.

01:08:32.174 --> 01:08:34.844
AND MORE IS NEEDED -- TO PROTECT

01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:36.812
PEOPLE IN THE FUTURE I TO HAVE

01:08:36.879 --> 01:08:39.014
LIVED THE WILDFIRES SINCE TWO

01:08:39.081 --> 01:08:40.583
THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN ACTUALLY

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:42.418
SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN

01:08:42.485 --> 01:08:43.953
WITH -- WHEN THE FIRE STARTED IN

01:08:44.019 --> 01:08:46.255
LAKE COUNTY -- I WOULD POINT OUT

01:08:46.322 --> 01:08:49.125
THAT ONE ONLY ONE IN TEN FIRES

01:08:49.191 --> 01:08:50.593
WILDFIRES IS STARTED.

01:08:50.659 --> 01:08:53.195
BY UTILITY. NINE OUT OF TEN OR

01:08:53.262 --> 01:08:54.163
NOT.

01:08:54.230 --> 01:08:55.397
AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CAR

01:08:55.464 --> 01:08:57.967
FIRE THAT WAS STARTED BY A OF A

01:08:58.033 --> 01:08:59.602
MALFUNCTION OF A CALL OF A OF A

01:08:59.668 --> 01:09:02.304
CAR IRONICALLY -- YOU LOOK AT

01:09:02.371 --> 01:09:04.640
THE THE LAKE COUNTY FIRES OR

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:05.541
START BY PEOPLE WORKING ON ON

01:09:05.608 --> 01:09:07.176
OFFENSE AND SOMEONE WORKING ON A

01:09:07.243 --> 01:09:08.477
ON A HOT WATER HEATER.

01:09:08.544 --> 01:09:09.845
THE LARGEST FIRE IN THE HISTORY

01:09:09.912 --> 01:09:11.280
THE STATE THE RANCH IN THE RIVER

01:09:11.347 --> 01:09:13.382
FIRE COMPLEX UP IN MENDOCINO IN

01:09:13.449 --> 01:09:15.951
IN LAKE COUNTY LAST YEAR.

01:09:16.018 --> 01:09:16.552
STARTED BY SOMEONE DOING RANCH

01:09:16.619 --> 01:09:16.752
WORK.

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:18.153
SO THESE ARE THESE ARE OTHER

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:19.655
ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH

01:09:19.722 --> 01:09:20.956
WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THESE PER

01:09:21.023 --> 01:09:21.891
PREVENTION.

01:09:21.957 --> 01:09:23.759
WE GOT OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY

01:09:23.826 --> 01:09:25.027
FIVE PEOPLE DIE SINCE TWO

01:09:25.094 --> 01:09:25.628
THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN IN THESE

01:09:25.694 --> 01:09:27.796
FIRES WE DON'T NEED ONE MORE

01:09:27.863 --> 01:09:28.931
PERSON TO DO THAT.

01:09:28.998 --> 01:09:31.033
THE PREVENTION AND ESPECIALLY IN

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:32.935
THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE IS

01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:34.336
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL.

01:09:34.403 --> 01:09:36.171
BECAUSE IT ULTIMATELY WE DON'T

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:37.506
HELP PEOPLE PREVENT THESE FIRES

01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:38.841
BY HARDENING THEIR HOMES IN

01:09:38.908 --> 01:09:41.544
INCREASING DEFENSIBLE SPACE.

01:09:41.610 --> 01:09:43.012
IT'S GOING TO AFFECT US ALL.

01:09:43.078 --> 01:09:44.146
WE'RE ALREADY SEEING THAT OUR

01:09:44.213 --> 01:09:45.881
INSURANCE MARKETS.

01:09:45.948 --> 01:09:48.350
PEOPLE ARE LOSING INSURANCE AT A

01:09:48.417 --> 01:09:49.919
AT A AT A REMARKABLE RATE WE'RE

01:09:49.985 --> 01:09:51.320
BEING FORCED ON TO THE FAIR PLAN

01:09:51.387 --> 01:09:52.354
WHICH WHICH MAKES THEIR

01:09:52.421 --> 01:09:53.789
INSURANCE RATES GO UP VERY VERY

01:09:53.856 --> 01:09:55.124
HIGH.

01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:56.492
WHICH MEANS IT'S DIFFICULT FOR

01:09:56.559 --> 01:09:57.726
THEM TO SELL A HOUSE WHICH MEANS

01:09:57.793 --> 01:09:58.961
IS DIFFICULT FOR SOMEONE TO BUY

01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:00.763
THAT HOUSE BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING

01:10:00.829 --> 01:10:01.263
TO HAVE TO PAY MORE FOR

01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:02.364
INSURANCE.

01:10:02.431 --> 01:10:03.832
THAT TRAIN IS COMING DOWN THE

01:10:03.899 --> 01:10:05.868
TRACKS AND THAT IN AND OUT AND

01:10:05.935 --> 01:10:07.202
AND WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH WITH

01:10:07.269 --> 01:10:08.938
THAT AS WELL BUT I THINK WE DO

01:10:09.004 --> 01:10:11.173
IT BY PREVENTING A RISK AND

01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:13.175
PREVENTING -- THESE FIRES FROM

01:10:13.242 --> 01:10:14.209
HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE TO

01:10:14.276 --> 01:10:15.911
STABILIZE AT SO I LOOK FORWARD

01:10:15.978 --> 01:10:18.147
TO WORKING IN ADDITION -- AS WE

01:10:18.213 --> 01:10:19.982
MOVE FORWARD ON THIS ISSUE --

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:22.318
WE'RE NOT DONE FOLKS -- THIS IS

01:10:22.384 --> 01:10:23.519
A HUGE STEP FORWARD.

01:10:23.586 --> 01:10:24.720
AND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS

01:10:24.787 --> 01:10:26.589
TODAY BECAUSE I THINK IT IS A

01:10:26.655 --> 01:10:28.424
HUGE STEP FORWARD AND I THINK WE

01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:29.825
NEED TO DO MORE I LOOK FORWARD

01:10:29.892 --> 01:10:31.093
TO DOING THAT I ASK YOUR SUPPORT

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:33.495
TODAY THANK YOU.

01:10:33.562 --> 01:10:34.063
THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD MISS

01:10:43.272 --> 01:10:44.840
HIGH FIRE RISK AREA.

01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:47.176
THIS ISSUE IS OF MAJOR CONCERN

01:10:47.242 --> 01:10:49.044
TO MY DISTRICT.

01:10:49.111 --> 01:10:50.579
I'VE HEARD A LOT OF JARGON IN

01:10:50.646 --> 01:10:52.081
RECENT WEEKS ABOUT UTILITY

BOND HOLDERS RATE PAYERS AND

01:10:56.151 --> 01:10:57.586
MORE.

01:10:57.653 --> 01:10:59.088
BUT WHAT THIS BILL IS REALLY

01:10:59.154 --> 01:11:00.222
ABOUT.

01:11:00.289 --> 01:11:01.490
IS MAKING SURE WE TAKE CARE OF

HIGHER RATES. FOR CALIFORNIANS

01:11:27.716 --> 01:11:29.418
IN FIRE PRONE AREAS THERE ARE A

01:11:29.485 --> 01:11:31.053
GROUNDBREAKING SAFETY

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.388
REQUIREMENTS TO PREVENT NEW

01:11:32.454 --> 01:11:35.824
WILDFIRES FROM UTILITY EQUIPMENT.

01:11:35.891 --> 01:11:37.660

01:11:43.198 --> 01:11:44.900
PROGRAM.

01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:47.069
SO LET'S FORGET ABOUT INVESTORS

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:48.437
AND COMMISSIONERS AND INSTEAD

01:11:48.504 --> 01:11:49.772

BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS IN

01:12:14.329 --> 01:12:15.764
THIS BILL I SUPPORT THIS BILL.

01:12:15.831 --> 01:12:17.199
THERE ARE THINGS IN THIS BILL

01:12:17.266 --> 01:12:19.768
THAT NEED TO BE EITHER APPROVED

01:12:19.835 --> 01:12:22.304
OR A FOLLOW ON BILL IN THE

01:12:22.371 --> 01:12:26.008
FUTURE NEEDS TO MATERIALIZE.

01:12:26.075 --> 01:12:27.743
WHAT WE'RE ADDRESSING HERE IS

01:12:27.810 --> 01:12:29.111
THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM THAT WE

01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:31.113
HAVE?

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:33.615
IN THE FUTURE THOUGH WE MUST

01:12:33.682 --> 01:12:36.819
LOOK TO RISK MITIGATION.

01:12:36.885 --> 01:12:38.954
IN INSURANCE TERM FOR TRYING TO

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:40.355
MITIGATE YOUR WRISTS.

01:12:40.422 --> 01:12:43.525
AND ALSO WE NEED TO LOOK AT

01:12:43.592 --> 01:12:46.628
LIMIT TEEN LAWSUITS RIGHT NOW IN

01:12:46.695 --> 01:12:49.865
THE HIGH FIRE AREAS MANY PEOPLE

01:12:49.932 --> 01:12:51.200
GO WITHOUT COVERAGE OR GO WITH

01:12:51.266 --> 01:12:53.035
LESS COVERAGE.

01:12:53.102 --> 01:12:54.636
BECAUSE OF AFFORDABILITY BY

01:12:54.703 --> 01:12:58.140
DEFAULT THAT MAKES THE I. O. USE

01:12:58.207 --> 01:13:00.809
THE INSURER OF CHOICE.

01:13:00.876 --> 01:13:02.878
BECAUSE THESE LAWSUITS OF THIRTY

01:13:02.945 --> 01:13:04.780
BILLION DOLLARS.

01:13:04.847 --> 01:13:08.016
SHOULD BE COVERED GREATLY BY THE

01:13:08.083 --> 01:13:11.086
HOMEOWNERS THEMSELVES THROUGH A

01:13:11.153 --> 01:13:12.621
PROPER INSURANCE PROGRAM.

01:13:12.688 --> 01:13:14.890
OUR FARE PROGRAM FOR THE PEOPLE

01:13:14.957 --> 01:13:17.126
THAT CAN'T QUALIFY.

01:13:17.192 --> 01:13:19.495
FOR THE CORRECT INSURANCE NEEDS

01:13:19.561 --> 01:13:20.729
TO BE REINFORCED [inaudible]

01:13:20.796 --> 01:13:25.467
AND FINANCED AT A HIGHER LEVEL.

01:13:25.534 --> 01:13:28.036
HOW WE DO THAT CAN BE WORKED OUT

01:13:28.103 --> 01:13:29.605
DOWN THE ROAD?

01:13:29.671 --> 01:13:31.907
AND THEN FINALLY.

01:13:31.974 --> 01:13:34.276
AND I'M NOT SAYING THIS BRAGGING.

01:13:34.343 --> 01:13:39.915
BUT OR SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC

01:13:39.982 --> 01:13:42.351
OVER THE LAST ELEVEN YEARS HAS

01:13:42.417 --> 01:13:45.254
DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB.

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:46.889
OF GRID MANAGEMENT.

01:13:46.955 --> 01:13:49.391
AND PUTTING IN MONITORS

01:13:49.458 --> 01:13:50.526
THROUGHOUT.

01:13:50.592 --> 01:13:53.695
OUR AREA IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY.

01:13:53.762 --> 01:13:55.497
ALMOST EVERY MOUNTAIN TOP HAS

01:13:55.564 --> 01:13:56.932
SENSORS.

SERIOUS DOUBTS ABOUT THIS

01:15:58.820 --> 01:16:00.822
PROPOSAL NOT ONLY ABOUT THE

TIMELINE THAT WE'VE BEEN GIVEN

01:16:38.593 --> 01:16:40.562
WHY WE WERE ELECTED WHY WE ARE

HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE?

01:16:43.498 --> 01:16:46.301

ABILITY TO UTILITIES.

01:17:06.021 --> 01:17:08.623
IT OFFERS A PAL FOR THOSE WHO

01:17:27.609 --> 01:17:29.244
GET OUT OF BANKRUPTCY.

01:17:29.311 --> 01:17:31.580

OUR JOB IS TO STABILIZE

01:17:52.134 --> 01:17:54.503
CALIFORNIA.

01:17:54.569 --> 01:17:56.204
AFTER MANY DISCUSSIONS WITH THE

01:17:56.271 --> 01:17:58.040
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND WITH THE

01:17:58.106 --> 01:18:00.842

CREATES THE CONDITIONS AND THE

01:18:08.517 --> 01:18:11.319

RESERVATIONS ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL.

01:18:20.562 --> 01:18:22.431
I BELIEVE THAT FAILING TO ACT

01:18:22.497 --> 01:18:24.833
TODAY MAY BE WORSE THAN THE

01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:27.335
STATUS QUO.

01:18:27.402 --> 01:18:29.271
AB.

01:18:29.337 --> 01:18:30.338
TEN FIFTY FOUR I BELIEVE IS A

01:18:30.405 --> 01:18:31.473
BEGINNING.

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:32.741
AND THAT IT WILL PROTECT OUR

RATE PAYERS IT WILL PROTECT OUR

01:18:35.343 --> 01:18:37.045

IT'LL PROTECT OUR WORKERS.

01:18:39.247 --> 01:18:40.916
AND THAT IS THE REASON.

01:18:40.982 --> 01:18:42.951
WHY I WAS ELECTED TO BE HERE AND

SUPPORTING THIS IN AN IMPORTANT

01:19:00.368 --> 01:19:01.169
MEASURE.

01:19:01.236 --> 01:19:03.805
OF WHEN I WAS A A YOUNG CHILD

01:19:03.872 --> 01:19:08.176
GROWING UP NOT FAR FROM -- THE

01:19:08.243 --> 01:19:10.579
WHERE THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL

01:19:10.645 --> 01:19:14.649
LIVES -- ONE OF MY EARLIEST

01:19:14.716 --> 01:19:17.886
RECOLLECTIONS -- IS WATCHING A

01:19:17.953 --> 01:19:20.655
FIRE -- CLIMB UP THROUGH THE SAN

01:19:20.722 --> 01:19:22.057
GABRIEL MOUNTAINS TO THE BASE OF

01:19:22.124 --> 01:19:25.026
THE SAN GABRIEL MOUNTAINS AND TO

01:19:25.093 --> 01:19:27.395
FURTHER FURTHER UP VERY VERY

01:19:27.462 --> 01:19:29.364
RAPIDLY TOWARDS MOUNT WILSON

01:19:29.431 --> 01:19:32.267
THAT WAS A LARGE FIRE THERE AND

01:19:32.334 --> 01:19:33.869
BUT IT STUCK IN MY MIND AND WHO

01:19:33.935 --> 01:19:36.471
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT YEARS

01:19:36.538 --> 01:19:39.441
LATER -- I WOULD BE EXPERIENCING

01:19:39.508 --> 01:19:41.710
FIRE AFTER FIRE AFTER FIRE AND

01:19:41.776 --> 01:19:43.712
THAT'S SO -- THE REMARKABLE

01:19:43.778 --> 01:19:46.348
THING THAT WE FACE TODAY IT'S

01:19:46.414 --> 01:19:48.316
NOT THAT FIRE EXISTS BUT IT'S

01:19:48.383 --> 01:19:51.186
THE INTENSITY AND THE FREQUENCY

01:19:51.253 --> 01:19:53.155
WITH WHICH THEY ARE OCCURRING.

01:19:53.221 --> 01:19:55.323
I'M IT IS.

01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:57.259

CALIFORNIA ARE GETTING UP AND

01:20:03.265 --> 01:20:04.799
SAYING.

01:20:04.866 --> 01:20:07.035
THERE WAS A FIRE IN MY DISTRICT

01:20:07.102 --> 01:20:09.070
AND MY DISTRICT WAS AFFECTED AND

01:20:09.137 --> 01:20:11.573
IN THE FOLLOWING WAY AND THAT'S

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:12.974
WHAT.

01:20:13.041 --> 01:20:14.442

NINETY EIGHT YEARS SIMILAR TO

01:23:19.327 --> 01:23:20.862

01:23:30.138 --> 01:23:32.207
THEFAILURE OF THESE LINES IS

01:23:32.273 --> 01:23:34.109
NOT A POTENTIAL CATASTROPHE

01:23:34.175 --> 01:23:35.610
WAITING TO HAPPEN IT IS A

01:23:35.677 --> 01:23:38.446
CATASTROPHE THAT WILL HAPPEN.

DANGER AND SUBSTANTIATED FEARS.

01:23:51.025 --> 01:23:52.293
THAT FUTURE FIRES CAUSED BY

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:55.163

OF MANY MORE.

01:23:56.731 --> 01:23:59.134
HOW COULD THEY NOT?

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:01.136
HOW COULD THEY NOT?

01:24:01.202 --> 01:24:02.370
YOU'D THINK THAT AFTER THE

01:24:08.376 --> 01:24:09.911
BEEN THE EVENT THAT HIGHLIGHTED.

01:24:09.978 --> 01:24:11.212
THE NEED FOR A NEW FOUND RESPECT

AS SOMETHING.

01:25:17.045 --> 01:25:19.013
OF A REWARD FOR MONSTROUS

OUR EFFORTS SHOULD MAKE PUBLIC

IF WE ARE TO ENTRUST THIS BILL

01:25:33.828 --> 01:25:35.997
WITH BEING A CORNERSTONE.

01:25:36.064 --> 01:25:37.966

TO PUT TOGETHER THIS BILL.

01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:00.475
THE QUESTION THAT REMAINS IN MY

01:28:00.541 --> 01:28:02.076
MIND IS WHETHER.

01:28:02.143 --> 01:28:03.878
WE COULD HAVE DONE BETTER.

01:28:03.945 --> 01:28:05.913

01:28:07.215 --> 01:28:09.617
OF THIS BILL [inaudible]

01:28:09.684 --> 01:28:11.219

01:28:15.657 --> 01:28:17.158
IMMINENT DEADLINE.

01:28:17.225 --> 01:28:18.326
THAT SHE KNEW WAS GONNA GO

01:28:18.393 --> 01:28:19.827
BANKRUPT.

01:28:19.894 --> 01:28:21.629
AND SO WE JUMPED AND WE PASSED

01:28:21.696 --> 01:28:25.199
SB NINE A ONE THEN FOR IT THEN

01:28:25.266 --> 01:28:26.601
PREVENT.

01:28:26.668 --> 01:28:27.101
ANY DIFFERENT GOING INTO

01:28:27.168 --> 01:28:28.770
BANKRUPTCY.

01:28:28.836 --> 01:28:30.938
BUT WE DID OUR BEST [inaudible]

01:28:31.005 --> 01:28:32.340
NOW.

01:28:32.407 --> 01:28:35.843
WE'RE BEING ASKED. TO PASS THIS

01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:37.412

IT BY JULY TWELFTH.

01:28:45.319 --> 01:28:46.487
THEN.

01:28:46.554 --> 01:28:48.890
EDISON IS GOING TO BE DOWNGRADED

01:28:48.956 --> 01:28:51.325
TO JUNK BOND STATUS AND THEY MAY

01:28:51.392 --> 01:28:54.762
FACE BANKRUPTCY.

01:28:54.829 --> 01:28:55.830
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:29:04.305 --> 01:29:06.240
AS WE GO FORWARD WITH ALL THE

01:29:06.307 --> 01:29:07.709
WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO BECAUSE

01:29:07.775 --> 01:29:10.078
WE KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT GOING

01:29:10.144 --> 01:29:10.278
TO BE.

01:29:10.344 --> 01:29:13.047
THE END.

01:29:13.114 --> 01:29:14.582
MY BIGGEST CONCERN.

01:29:14.649 --> 01:29:16.050
THAT I SHARE WITH ASSEMBLY

01:29:16.117 --> 01:29:18.986
MEMBER RAMOS IS THE WEAKENING OF

01:29:19.053 --> 01:29:22.490
THE PROJECT MANAGER STANDARD.

01:29:22.557 --> 01:29:25.626
THIS ONLY PROTECTS RATE PAYERS.

01:29:25.693 --> 01:29:27.128
AND I CONFIRM THIS DURING OUR

01:29:27.195 --> 01:29:28.362
UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMMITTEE

01:29:28.429 --> 01:29:31.232
HEARING YESTERDAY THIS ONLY

01:29:31.299 --> 01:29:31.532
[inaudible]

01:29:31.599 --> 01:29:35.036
CAPS THE INCREASED COSTS FOR

01:29:35.103 --> 01:29:37.505
RATEPAYERS AS LONG AS THE FUN

01:29:37.572 --> 01:29:38.239
LAUGHS.

01:29:38.306 --> 01:29:41.809
WELL FOLKS.

01:29:41.876 --> 01:29:43.811
AS OUR CHAIRMAN.

01:29:43.878 --> 01:29:45.513
OF THE UTILITIES AND ENERGY

01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:47.348
COMMITTEE STRONGER OFTEN IS

01:29:47.415 --> 01:29:49.350
PRESENTATION OF THIS BILL

01:29:49.417 --> 01:29:49.650
[inaudible]

01:29:49.717 --> 01:29:52.386
TALK ABOUT. TEN OF THE WORST

01:29:52.453 --> 01:29:54.956
WILDFIRES IN THE HISTORY OF THE

01:29:55.022 --> 01:29:56.524
SANTA CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN JUST

01:29:56.591 --> 01:29:58.559
IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS.

01:29:58.626 --> 01:30:01.229
AND IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE.

01:30:01.295 --> 01:30:05.633
CLIMATE CHANGE IS HERE AND NOW.

01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:06.300
AND IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE

01:30:06.367 --> 01:30:09.804
AND SO IT.

01:30:09.871 --> 01:30:12.273
WE FACED A PROPERTY DAMAGE

01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:15.042
LIABILITY JUSTIN TWENTY

01:30:15.109 --> 01:30:16.444
SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN OF

01:30:16.511 --> 01:30:19.280
OVER TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS.

01:30:19.347 --> 01:30:20.882
AND NOW THE PROJECTION IS AT

01:30:20.948 --> 01:30:22.350
THIS FORTY BILLION DOLLAR FUND

01:30:22.416 --> 01:30:25.319
IS GOING WAS IS GOING TO LAST US

01:30:25.386 --> 01:30:27.188
FOR TEN YEARS.

01:30:27.255 --> 01:30:35.563
DO THE MATH.

01:30:35.630 --> 01:30:38.533
MY CONCERN IS THAT WE HAD AN

01:30:38.599 --> 01:30:44.806
OPPORTUNITY. TO PACKAGE TOGETHER

01:30:44.872 --> 01:30:45.106
[inaudible]

01:30:45.173 --> 01:30:46.507
AND ADDRESS.

01:30:46.574 --> 01:30:47.942
AND MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE

01:30:48.009 --> 01:30:49.544
STAKEHOLDERS ARE INVOLVED IN

01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:51.546
THIS AND THIS [inaudible]

01:30:51.612 --> 01:30:53.648
CRISIS HERE.

01:30:53.714 --> 01:30:55.550
I CAN SHARE.

01:30:55.616 --> 01:30:57.385
MY CONCERN WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:30:57.451 --> 01:30:58.953
WOULD ABOUT.

01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:00.388
HOW THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WERE

01:31:00.454 --> 01:31:02.590
WERE ASKING RATE PAYERS TO PAY

01:31:02.657 --> 01:31:04.358
AND WE'RE ASKING UTILITIES TO

01:31:04.425 --> 01:31:05.827
PAN WHERE THE INSURANCE

01:31:05.893 --> 01:31:07.428
COMPANIES?

01:31:07.495 --> 01:31:10.431
THEY'RE NOT PART OF THIS DEAL.

01:31:10.498 --> 01:31:12.400
INSURANCE COMPANIES.

01:31:12.466 --> 01:31:13.935
NEED TO BE STEPPING UP. TO

01:31:14.001 --> 01:31:15.837
ADDRESS.

01:31:15.903 --> 01:31:17.171
THIS COST CRISIS THAT WE'RE

01:31:17.238 --> 01:31:19.707
FACING.

01:31:19.774 --> 01:31:21.042
AND WE ALSO HAVE UNFINISHED

01:31:21.108 --> 01:31:23.511
BUSINESS IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING

01:31:23.578 --> 01:31:25.513
THE ISSUE OF STRICT LIABILITY.

01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:27.014
I KNOW THAT THAT'S ON POPULAR

01:31:27.081 --> 01:31:28.583
ESPECIALLY FOR MEMBERS THAT

01:31:28.649 --> 01:31:29.684
REPRESENT.

01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:31.919
PAGE YOU NEED JURISDICTIONS.

01:31:31.986 --> 01:31:33.821
BUT IT I I THINK.

01:31:33.888 --> 01:31:34.822
THERE NEEDS TO BE GROWING

01:31:34.889 --> 01:31:36.757
AWARENESS THAT RATE PAIR

01:31:36.824 --> 01:31:40.962
ADVOCATES LIKE TURN SUPPORT.

01:31:41.028 --> 01:31:42.430
INVERSE CONDEMNATION REFORM.

01:31:42.496 --> 01:31:43.831
ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS LIKE THE

01:31:43.898 --> 01:31:45.233
NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE

01:31:45.299 --> 01:31:47.034
COUNCIL SUPPORT INVERSE

01:31:47.101 --> 01:31:49.170
CONDEMNATION REFORM [inaudible]

01:31:49.237 --> 01:31:51.639
WE CAN'T.

01:31:51.706 --> 01:31:53.908
ESPECIALLY WITH THE WEAKENED

01:31:53.975 --> 01:31:54.575
PRUDENT MENACED STANDARD THAT'S

01:31:54.642 --> 01:31:56.677
ONLY GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR

01:31:56.744 --> 01:31:58.813
THE UTILITIES TO PASS WHAT FAR

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:00.514
COST ALONG TO RATE PAYERS.

01:32:00.581 --> 01:32:02.817
WE CAN'T KEEP ASKING RATE PAYERS

01:32:02.884 --> 01:32:04.952
TO BEAR THE EVER INCREASING

01:32:05.019 --> 01:32:07.221
COSTS OF WILDFIRES.

01:32:07.288 --> 01:32:08.956
SO I JUST WANT [inaudible]

01:32:09.023 --> 01:32:12.560
TO EMPHASIZE.

01:32:12.627 --> 01:32:14.695
HOWEVER THE VOTE TURNS OUT TODAY.

01:32:14.762 --> 01:32:15.897
THAT THIS BILL IS JUST BUYING

01:32:15.963 --> 01:32:19.367
TIME.

01:32:19.433 --> 01:32:21.769
I CLIMATE CHANGE.

01:32:21.836 --> 01:32:22.370
IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO GET

01:32:22.436 --> 01:32:25.072
WORSE.

01:32:25.139 --> 01:32:25.940
AND WE HAVE A LOT OF UNFINISHED

01:32:26.007 --> 01:32:31.545
WORK TO DO.

01:32:31.612 --> 01:32:33.114
MISTER PATTERSON YOU ARE

01:32:33.180 --> 01:32:34.348
RECOGNIZED.

01:32:34.415 --> 01:32:35.983
THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS

01:32:36.050 --> 01:32:37.518
I RISE TO US SUPPORT.

01:32:37.585 --> 01:32:39.320
IN CONCURRENCE WITH THE SENATE

01:32:39.387 --> 01:32:41.055
AMENDMENTS.

01:32:41.122 --> 01:32:43.724
MONEY JUST MAKE A COUPLE OF

01:32:43.791 --> 01:32:45.359
SIGNIFICANT POINTS HERE.

01:32:45.426 --> 01:32:46.494
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:48.829
THIS IS WELL BALANCED.

01:32:48.896 --> 01:32:51.432
THE RATE PAYERS PAY NO MORE IN

01:32:51.499 --> 01:32:53.868
FEES OR IN RATE INCREASES THEN

01:32:53.935 --> 01:32:55.636
THEY PRESENTLY DO THIS DOES NOT

01:32:55.703 --> 01:32:57.738
TOUCH.

01:32:57.805 --> 01:32:59.807
RATE INCREASES NUMBER.

01:32:59.874 --> 01:33:02.343
ONE NUMBER TWO IT IT PROVIDES AN

01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:05.947
UNPRECEDENTED. TEN ALMOST ELEVEN

01:33:06.013 --> 01:33:07.615
BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE

01:33:07.682 --> 01:33:10.084
SHAREHOLDERS OF THE UTILITIES.

01:33:10.151 --> 01:33:11.252
AND I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT

01:33:11.319 --> 01:33:14.789
THAT THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS.

01:33:14.855 --> 01:33:16.357
ARE NOT JOSH STE.

01:33:16.424 --> 01:33:19.827
BACK IN WALL STREET.

01:33:19.894 --> 01:33:21.796
MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS IN A

01:33:21.862 --> 01:33:23.464
FOR A ONCE AND IN THEIR

01:33:23.531 --> 01:33:25.599
RETIREMENT SYSTEMS.

01:33:25.666 --> 01:33:28.002
ARE EXPOSED.

01:33:28.069 --> 01:33:29.537
TO UTILITY INVESTMENTS.

01:33:29.603 --> 01:33:32.773
WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF A SECOND

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:34.475
OR A THIRD.

01:33:34.542 --> 01:33:37.211
MAJOR UTILITY BEING UNDER THE

01:33:37.278 --> 01:33:39.013
KIND OF STRESS.

01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:41.248
OF THAT WE ARE ATTEMPTING. TO

01:33:41.315 --> 01:33:44.485
DEAL WITH HERE PRESENTLY.

01:33:44.552 --> 01:33:46.320
SO I THINK THAT THIS IS A

01:33:46.387 --> 01:33:50.224
CENTRAL. FOR US TO TAKE THIS

01:33:50.291 --> 01:33:52.026
STEP.

01:33:52.093 --> 01:33:53.260
BUT OTHER MEMBERS HERE TAKE

01:33:53.327 --> 01:33:55.963
SAYING ADDITIONAL STEPS AS WELL.

01:33:56.030 --> 01:33:57.531
AND THAT'S REALLY REALLY

01:33:57.598 --> 01:34:01.235
IMPORTANT -- BUT SERVED ON THE

01:34:01.302 --> 01:34:03.637
UTILITY AND ENERGY. FOR FIVE AND

01:34:03.704 --> 01:34:06.140
A HALF YEARS THIS IS CLOSE TO ME.

01:34:06.207 --> 01:34:08.776
FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT AND I

01:34:08.843 --> 01:34:10.444
COMMEND OUR CHAIR FOR THE WORK

01:34:10.511 --> 01:34:11.679
AND THAT HE'S DONE.

01:34:11.746 --> 01:34:14.248
ON THIS.

01:34:14.315 --> 01:34:16.717
BUT I COME AT THIS ALSO.

01:34:16.784 --> 01:34:18.352
AS SOMEONE.

01:34:18.419 --> 01:34:20.721
WHO REALLY BELIEVES THAT THE

01:34:20.788 --> 01:34:22.123
STATE OF CALIFORNIA?

01:34:22.189 --> 01:34:24.558
HAS TO START GETTING.

01:34:24.625 --> 01:34:26.727
THE KINDS OF RESOURCES AND THE

01:34:26.794 --> 01:34:28.529
KINDS OF EFFORTS IN C. INTO IT

01:34:28.596 --> 01:34:30.464
THAT WE GET THESE FIRES PUT OUT

01:34:30.531 --> 01:34:32.500
EARLY AND THAT THEY DO NOT

01:34:32.566 --> 01:34:33.701
EXPLODE.

01:34:33.768 --> 01:34:35.336
MEMBERS WE HAVE SEE ONE THIRTIES

01:34:35.403 --> 01:34:36.404
THAT ARE GOING TO BE COMING ON

01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:37.838
LINE WITH TECHNOLOGY THAT'S

01:34:37.905 --> 01:34:38.973
GOING TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:40.174
RETARDANTS.

01:34:40.241 --> 01:34:42.543
SUBSTANTIALLY -- IN THE FUTURE

01:34:42.610 --> 01:34:45.179
WE ARE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING PRE

01:34:45.246 --> 01:34:46.313
POSITIONING.

01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:49.917
ALL ON A REGULAR BASIS OF OUR

01:34:49.984 --> 01:34:52.253
FIREFIGHTERS THE THE THE TRUCKS

01:34:52.319 --> 01:34:54.488
<u>ND ALL OF THAT SO THAT WHEN WE</u>

01:34:54.555 --> 01:34:56.791
SEE IT SPARK WE CAN GET

01:34:56.857 --> 01:34:58.359
RESOURCES TO IT.

01:34:58.426 --> 01:35:00.261
QUICKLY.

01:35:00.327 --> 01:35:01.262
I HAVEN'T IN THIS.

01:35:01.328 --> 01:35:02.596
ALMOST SIX YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE

01:35:02.663 --> 01:35:05.733
I HAVE NOT SEEN A MORE FOCUSED.

01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:08.469
SERIOUS CONCERN ON WHAT DO WE DO

01:35:08.536 --> 01:35:10.237
NOW.

01:35:10.304 --> 01:35:11.639
THIS IS A STEPPING POINT FOR

01:35:11.705 --> 01:35:14.275
STABILITY.

01:35:14.341 --> 01:35:17.945
INSTABILITY COULD VERY WELL MEAN.

01:35:18.012 --> 01:35:20.781
BANKRUPTCY FOR ALL OF THESE

01:35:20.848 --> 01:35:22.049
UTILITIES.

01:35:22.116 --> 01:35:24.852
AND THAT WOULD BE.

01:35:24.919 --> 01:35:26.720
A TERRIBLE OCCURRENCE. FOR

01:35:26.787 --> 01:35:29.557
RELIABILITY FOR RATES -- AND FOR

01:35:29.623 --> 01:35:31.258
THE FUNDAMENTAL DELIVERY OF

01:35:31.325 --> 01:35:32.526
ELECTRICITY.

01:35:32.593 --> 01:35:34.995
MEMBERS WE ARE THE FIFTH LARGEST

01:35:35.062 --> 01:35:37.131
ECONOMY ON THE PLANET.

01:35:37.198 --> 01:35:39.733
WE ARE ALMOST TWENTY YEARS INTO

01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:45.272
THE A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY M..

01:35:45.339 --> 01:35:46.474
DUST CALIFORNIA ELECTRICITY GRID

01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:48.175
IS.

01:35:48.242 --> 01:35:49.577
SOMEWHAT DISINTEGRATING IN FRONT

01:35:49.643 --> 01:35:51.278
OF OUR EYES.

01:35:51.345 --> 01:35:52.947
AND WE HAVE SEEN RELIABILITY

01:35:53.013 --> 01:35:54.181
ISSUES AND WE HAVE SEEN COST

01:35:54.248 --> 01:35:56.350
ISSUES.

01:35:56.417 --> 01:35:58.185
THAT HAVE DRIVEN SOME PEOPLE IN

01:35:58.252 --> 01:36:01.122
CALIFORNIA SAY WE CAN'T AFFORD.

01:36:01.188 --> 01:36:03.757
THIS KIND OF EXPENSE.

01:36:03.824 --> 01:36:07.528
IT ONLY GETS WORSE IF THE GRID

01:36:07.595 --> 01:36:11.499
CONTINUES. TO DE TO TO TO BE. TO

01:36:11.565 --> 01:36:14.034
START FALLING APART AND I KNOW

01:36:14.101 --> 01:36:16.036
THIS SOUNDS A BIT [inaudible]

01:36:16.103 --> 01:36:17.605
DRACONIAN.

01:36:17.671 --> 01:36:22.309
MEMBERS WE HAVE A GRADE ISSUE.

01:36:22.376 --> 01:36:25.012
AND WE HAVE A STABILITY ISSUE.

01:36:25.079 --> 01:36:28.382
AND WE HAVE A FINANCE ISSUE.

01:36:28.449 --> 01:36:31.051
AND DOING NOTHING.

01:36:31.118 --> 01:36:33.754
IS A CERTAINTY THAT WE WILL JUST

01:36:33.821 --> 01:36:35.656
SEE THE PROBLEMS IN THE PGA ANY

01:36:35.723 --> 01:36:37.024
SERVICE AREA.

01:36:37.091 --> 01:36:38.926
IN A BUNCH OF OTHER AREAS IN THE

01:36:38.993 --> 01:36:40.728
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:36:40.794 --> 01:36:42.963
AND THEN I WANT TO A CLOSE WITH

01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:44.465
A UP A PERSONAL [inaudible]

01:36:44.532 --> 01:36:46.000
PLAY.

01:36:46.066 --> 01:36:47.268
FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK

01:36:47.334 --> 01:36:48.636

STANDING UP AND SAYING WE GOT TO

01:36:50.471 --> 01:36:51.772
DO A WHOLE WHOLE LOT MORE.

IN MANAGING OUR FOREST AND

01:36:53.374 --> 01:36:55.376
GETTING THESE DEAD TREES OUT WE

01:36:55.442 --> 01:36:56.777
HAVE FUEL.

01:36:56.844 --> 01:36:57.978
ARE THAT ISN'T.

01:36:58.045 --> 01:37:00.447
THE UTILITIES BALK LYING ALL

01:37:00.514 --> 01:37:02.917
OVER OUR FORESTS AND WE'VE GOT

01:37:02.983 --> 01:37:05.986
TO GET THOSE THAT MATERIAL OUT.

01:37:06.053 --> 01:37:07.521
AND WE'VE GOT TO GET OUR FORESTS

01:37:07.588 --> 01:37:09.290
MANAGED SO THAT THEY DO NOT

01:37:09.356 --> 01:37:10.658
EXPLODE.

01:37:10.724 --> 01:37:11.725
IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT

01:37:11.792 --> 01:37:13.494
PHOTOGRAPHS FOR EXAMPLE OF OUR

01:37:13.561 --> 01:37:16.230
FORESTS FIFTY YEARS AGO THEY HAD

01:37:16.297 --> 01:37:17.565
SOMETHING LIKE A HUNDRED A

01:37:17.631 --> 01:37:18.899
HUNDRED AND FIFTY TREES. TO THE

01:37:18.966 --> 01:37:22.203
ACRE WE NOW HAVE SOMETHING LIKE

01:37:22.269 --> 01:37:22.803
FIVE HUNDRED SIX HUNDRED TREES

01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:23.804
TO THE THEIR TENDER BOXES WERE

01:37:23.871 --> 01:37:25.105
READY TO EXPLODE.

01:37:25.172 --> 01:37:26.140
THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO FIGHT

01:37:26.207 --> 01:37:27.641
FIRES IN A MUCH.

01:37:27.708 --> 01:37:29.276
BIGGER MORE BROADER MORE ROBUST

01:37:29.343 --> 01:37:30.578
WAY WE'VE GOT TO MANAGE OUR

01:37:30.644 --> 01:37:31.612
FORESTS.

01:37:31.679 --> 01:37:33.013
AND THEN I'M JUST GOING TO SAY

01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:34.982
THIS I HAVE MY DAUGHTER MY SON

01:37:35.049 --> 01:37:36.917
IN LAW TO OF OUR FOUR GRAND KIDS

01:37:36.984 --> 01:37:37.985
THEY LIVE AT THREE THOUSAND FEET

01:37:38.052 --> 01:37:43.290
UP IN THE FOREST AREA OUT OF OUT

01:37:43.357 --> 01:37:43.824
OF BASS LAKE.

01:37:43.891 --> 01:37:44.391
AREA [inaudible]

01:37:44.458 --> 01:37:45.459
THEY'RE FRIGHTENED.

01:37:45.526 --> 01:37:47.561
THEY'RE AFRAID THEY HAVE EXIT

01:37:47.628 --> 01:37:49.763
PLANS AND THEY LIVE IN A PLACE

01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:52.533
WHERE THEY COULD BE NEXT.

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:54.235
DOING WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW AND

01:37:54.301 --> 01:37:55.736
IN THE FUTURE.

01:37:55.803 --> 01:37:59.039
I HOPE TO GOD WILL HELP SAVE NOT

01:37:59.106 --> 01:38:01.442
ONLY MY LOVED ONES.

01:38:01.508 --> 01:38:02.977
BUT YOUR LOVED ONES AS WELL SO I

01:38:03.043 --> 01:38:06.046
URGE AN AYE VOTE.

01:38:06.113 --> 01:38:06.680
THANK YOU MISS PATTERSON DOCTOR

01:38:06.747 --> 01:38:07.715
QUIRK.

01:38:07.781 --> 01:38:09.617
YOU ARE RECOGNIZED FOR ME TO ASK.

01:38:09.683 --> 01:38:13.354
YES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB.

01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:13.988
TEN FIFTY FOUR OTHER NUMBER OF

01:38:14.054 --> 01:38:16.657
QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED BY.

01:38:16.724 --> 01:38:18.759
MY COLLEAGUES THAT I HOPE TO BE

01:38:18.826 --> 01:38:20.027
ABLE TO ANSWER.

01:38:20.094 --> 01:38:21.862
FIRST OF ALL WHY DID SB NINE A

01:38:21.929 --> 01:38:23.564
ONE FAIL.

01:38:23.631 --> 01:38:25.699
IT'S BECAUSE WE GAVE THE P. YOU

01:38:25.766 --> 01:38:27.268
SEE THE AUTHORITY.

01:38:27.334 --> 01:38:29.570
AND THE PRESIDENT PICKER THE P.

01:38:29.637 --> 01:38:32.273
YOU SEE SAID -- RE READ NINE NO

01:38:32.339 --> 01:38:33.807
ONE WE DIDN'T THINK IT REQUIRED

01:38:33.874 --> 01:38:35.309
US TO ACT.

01:38:35.376 --> 01:38:38.646
THAT CAUSED A DISASTER THIS BILL

01:38:38.712 --> 01:38:40.648
DOES NOT DEPEND UPON THE P. YOU

01:38:40.714 --> 01:38:41.715
SEE.

01:38:41.782 --> 01:38:44.385
AND IN FACT. ONE OF MY

01:38:44.451 --> 01:38:46.520
COLLEAGUES HAS SUGGESTED THAT WE

01:38:46.587 --> 01:38:48.589
NEED TO GET P. G. NEED TO REPAIR

01:38:48.656 --> 01:38:49.890
THEIR LINES.

01:38:49.957 --> 01:38:51.659
AND FRANKLY IF WE HAD TO DEPEND

01:38:51.725 --> 01:38:54.928
UPON THE P. YOU SEE IS NON.

01:38:54.995 --> 01:38:57.364
AS NON WORKING AS IT IS NOW I

01:38:57.431 --> 01:38:58.999
DON'T KNOW HOW WE DO THAT THAT'S

01:38:59.066 --> 01:39:01.669
WHY WE'RE SETTING UP A SEPARATE

01:39:01.735 --> 01:39:05.239
SAFETY -- DEPARTMENT WHICH WILL

01:39:05.306 --> 01:39:06.373
EVENTUALLY.

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:08.142
GO OUT OF THE P. YOU SEE OVER

01:39:08.208 --> 01:39:10.110
THE NEXT TWO YEARS TO ENFORCE

01:39:10.177 --> 01:39:11.645
THAT SAFETY.

01:39:11.712 --> 01:39:13.480
SO I THINK THAT THIS IS FAR

01:39:13.547 --> 01:39:15.416
SUPERIOR TO NINE A ONE BECAUSE

01:39:15.482 --> 01:39:17.351
WE WE ARE BYPASSING THE P. YOU

01:39:17.418 --> 01:39:21.322
SEE -- AND I BELIEVE THIS WILL

01:39:21.388 --> 01:39:23.524
GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET.

01:39:23.590 --> 01:39:24.725
P. JEANNIE AND THE OTHER

01:39:24.792 --> 01:39:27.695
UTILITIES TO UPGRADE THEIR LINES.

01:39:27.761 --> 01:39:29.763
FINALLY THERE'S A QUESTION OF

01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:31.465
THE FUN DURABILITY.

01:39:31.532 --> 01:39:33.267
AND TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS

01:39:33.334 --> 01:39:35.202
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A LOT GIVEN

01:39:35.269 --> 01:39:37.037
WHAT'S HAPPENED BUT IT IS AND

01:39:37.104 --> 01:39:38.038
HERE'S WHY.

01:39:38.105 --> 01:39:39.340
IS BECAUSE WE'RE TAKING

01:39:39.406 --> 01:39:41.809
PROACTIVE STEPS NOW.

01:39:41.875 --> 01:39:43.844
THAT THE UTILITIES ARE TURNING

01:39:43.911 --> 01:39:46.880
OFF THEIR WIRES WHEN WE GET HI

01:39:46.947 --> 01:39:48.515
FIRE.

01:39:48.582 --> 01:39:50.951
OFF -- DAYS HIGH FIRE PROPENSITY

01:39:51.018 --> 01:39:53.754
DAYS WHEN EARLIER THIS YEAR

01:39:53.821 --> 01:39:55.789
THERE WAS A DRY DAY WITH HIGH

01:39:55.856 --> 01:39:58.926
WINDS AND HIGH TEMPERATURES THE

01:39:58.992 --> 01:40:00.294
LINES WERE TURNED OFF.

01:40:00.361 --> 01:40:02.363
FURTHER WE'RE WORKING ON

01:40:02.429 --> 01:40:04.431
MANAGING OUR FORESTS AND TAKING

01:40:04.498 --> 01:40:07.468
MANY OTHER PROACTIVE STEPS

01:40:07.534 --> 01:40:07.768
[inaudible]

01:40:07.835 --> 01:40:14.108
THIS -- FUND WAS LOOKED AT BUY.

01:40:14.174 --> 01:40:17.177
A CONSULTING GROUP. TO SAY WHAT

01:40:17.244 --> 01:40:19.413
WOULD IT TAKE TO STABILIZE THESE

01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:22.116
UTILITIES WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO

01:40:22.182 --> 01:40:24.451
HELP OUT THE VICTIMS THIS IS A

01:40:24.518 --> 01:40:25.786
NUMBER THEY CAME UP WITH.

01:40:25.853 --> 01:40:28.088
NOT LOOKING AT WHAT WE'VE DONE

01:40:28.155 --> 01:40:30.224
BUT WHAT WE WILL DO.

01:40:30.290 --> 01:40:32.860
I URGE EVERYONE TO SUPPORT AB

01:40:32.926 --> 01:40:36.730

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER.

01:40:41.602 --> 01:40:43.003
I'M NOT HERE TO DEFEND P. GENIES

01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:44.738
CONDUCT WE ALL TRUSTED THEM FOR

01:40:44.805 --> 01:40:46.006
DECADES.

01:40:46.073 --> 01:40:48.242
WE TRUSTED THEY WOULD INVEST IN

01:40:48.308 --> 01:40:50.511
SAFETY AND HARDEN THE GRADE AND

01:40:50.577 --> 01:40:52.379
THEY LET US DOWN.

01:40:52.446 --> 01:40:53.981
WE CAN'T CHANGE THAT WE CAN ONLY

01:40:54.047 --> 01:40:54.782
DEAL.

01:40:54.848 --> 01:40:55.949
WITH THE PRESIDENT AND DEAL WITH

01:40:56.016 --> 01:40:57.217
THE FUTURE.

01:40:57.284 --> 01:40:58.385
AND IF YOU DON'T WANT THAT TO

01:40:58.452 --> 01:41:00.354
HAPPEN AGAIN THEN I SUGGEST YOU

01:41:00.421 --> 01:41:01.655
NEED TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY.

01:41:01.722 --> 01:41:03.724
BECAUSE IT FORCES THEM IF FORCES

01:41:03.791 --> 01:41:05.626
ALL THE UTILITIES TO MAKE THE

01:41:05.692 --> 01:41:07.761
NECESSARY INVESTMENTS TO HARDEN

01:41:07.828 --> 01:41:09.630
THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO UPGRADE

01:41:09.696 --> 01:41:11.632
THE GRID AND WHAT LET'S PUT A

01:41:11.698 --> 01:41:13.000
HUMAN FACE FOR SECOND ON

01:41:13.066 --> 01:41:14.902
BANKRUPTCY.

01:41:14.968 --> 01:41:16.970
IT HAS A TOLL IT MEANS DELAYED

01:41:17.037 --> 01:41:19.440
COMPENSATION FOR FIRE VICTIMS.

01:41:19.506 --> 01:41:21.241
IT MEANS WORKERS RUN CERTAIN

01:41:21.308 --> 01:41:23.310
ABOUT THEIR PAYCHECKS.

01:41:23.377 --> 01:41:25.279
IT MEANS THAT PEOPLE SUFFER IT

01:41:25.345 --> 01:41:26.213
MEANS.

01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:27.815
THAT DOWNSTREAM COMPANIES ARE AT

01:41:27.881 --> 01:41:29.716
RISK OF BANKRUPTCY IN MY

01:41:29.783 --> 01:41:30.884
DISTRICT THERE'S THE TOPAZ

01:41:30.951 --> 01:41:33.887
VALLEY SOLAR POWER PLANT.

01:41:33.954 --> 01:41:35.956
THAT FACILITY AND THE OWNERS

01:41:36.023 --> 01:41:37.591
THAT FACILITY THE SECOND P.

01:41:37.658 --> 01:41:39.059
JEANNIE WENT BANKRUPT.

01:41:39.126 --> 01:41:40.861
THE SECOND THEY WENT BANKRUPT

01:41:40.928 --> 01:41:42.763
THE OWNERS OF THAT FACILITY.

01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:43.497
THEY WERE DOWNGRADED TO JUNK

01:41:43.564 --> 01:41:45.199
BOND STATUS.

01:41:45.265 --> 01:41:48.168
BECAUSE OF P. GENIES BANKRUPTCY.

01:41:48.235 --> 01:41:50.337
WE CANNOT SITE SOLAR POWER IN

01:41:50.404 --> 01:41:50.838
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:41:50.904 --> 01:41:52.673
PRESENTLY.

01:41:52.739 --> 01:41:54.641
THAT'S A PROBLEM FOLKS.

01:41:54.708 --> 01:41:56.643
WE'VE ENACTED SOME VERY VERY

01:41:56.710 --> 01:41:58.145
AMBITIOUS CLEAN ENERGY GOALS IN

01:41:58.212 --> 01:42:00.180
THE STATE AND TO GET TO EIGHT TO

01:42:00.247 --> 01:42:01.515
BE AND REACH THOSE GOALS.

01:42:01.582 --> 01:42:03.250
WE NEED INDUSTRIAL SCALE SOLAR

01:42:03.317 --> 01:42:04.718
WE NEED OFFSHORE WIND WE NEED ON

01:42:04.785 --> 01:42:06.253
SHORE WHEN WE NEED RENEWABLE

01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:07.855
POWER.

01:42:07.921 --> 01:42:08.455
AND WHEN YOU'VE GOT A BANKRUPT

01:42:08.522 --> 01:42:09.857
UTILITY.

01:42:09.923 --> 01:42:11.592
YOU HAVE NOBODY TO BUY THAT

01:42:11.658 --> 01:42:12.759
ENERGY AND DISTRIBUTED.

01:42:12.826 --> 01:42:15.562
THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM.

01:42:15.629 --> 01:42:17.064
SO LET'S CONSIDER THE HUMAN TOLL

01:42:17.130 --> 01:42:17.364
[inaudible]

01:42:17.431 --> 01:42:19.066
I BELIEVE.

01:42:19.132 --> 01:42:21.068
THE RISK TO THE OTHER UTILITIES

01:42:21.134 --> 01:42:22.369
ISRAEL.

01:42:22.436 --> 01:42:23.504
I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO TAKE

01:42:23.570 --> 01:42:25.138
ACTION.

01:42:25.205 --> 01:42:26.573
THIS BILL FOR THE FIRST TIME I

01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:28.408
SAY THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO DID NOT

01:42:28.475 --> 01:42:30.077
VOTE FOR NINE A ONE I VOTED NO.

01:42:30.143 --> 01:42:32.045
AND IF YOU TOLD ME THAT.

01:42:32.112 --> 01:42:34.982
THIS BODY WOULD COME UP WITH A

01:42:35.048 --> 01:42:35.616
PLAN THAT WOULD PROTECT REPAIRS

01:42:35.682 --> 01:42:35.916
[inaudible]

01:42:35.983 --> 01:42:37.317
WOULD GET.

01:42:37.384 --> 01:42:39.353
COMPENSATION MORE QUICKLY TO

01:42:39.419 --> 01:42:40.654
FIRE VICTIMS.

01:42:40.721 --> 01:42:42.523
WOULD FORCE THE UTILITIES TO

01:42:42.589 --> 01:42:42.990
INVEST IN HARDING THE

01:42:43.056 --> 01:42:44.825
INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:42:44.892 --> 01:42:48.629
WOULD DO ALL THAT.

01:42:48.695 --> 01:42:49.696
AND STABILIZE THE ENERGY MARKETS

01:42:49.763 --> 01:42:51.865
SO WE CAN SAID ABOUT.

01:42:51.932 --> 01:42:54.134
PROVIDING POWER CHEAP CLEAN AND

01:42:54.201 --> 01:42:55.936
SAFE TO OUR CONSTITUENTS.

01:42:56.003 --> 01:42:56.537
I DON'T KNOW THAT I WOULD HAVE

01:42:56.603 --> 01:42:57.804
BELIEVED YOU.

01:42:57.871 --> 01:42:59.273

COMMUNITIES WIPED OUT. EIGHTY

01:46:17.337 --> 01:46:20.407
FIVE PEOPLE KILLED.

01:46:22.709 --> 01:46:25.679
THIS BILL.

01:46:25.746 --> 01:46:26.947
NGUYEN P. JEANNIE DECIDED TO

01:46:27.013 --> 01:46:30.350
DECLARE BANKRUPTCY IN JANUARY IT

01:46:30.417 --> 01:46:33.086
WAS A PUNCH IN OUR GUT.

01:46:33.153 --> 01:46:34.688
RATHER THAN ALLOW THE

01:46:34.755 --> 01:46:37.924
INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS TO PROCEED.

01:46:37.991 --> 01:46:40.026
AND TO DECIDE WHAT THEIR ACTUAL

01:46:40.093 --> 01:46:41.695
LEGAL OBLIGATIONS WERE THEY

01:46:41.762 --> 01:46:44.531
DECIDED TO DECLARE BANKRUPTCY.

01:46:44.598 --> 01:46:48.835
NOT OUR CHOICE LIKE THE DECISION

01:46:48.902 --> 01:46:50.637
TO DELAY MAINTENANCE.

01:46:50.704 --> 01:46:54.975
ONLINE'S WAS NOT OUR CHOICE.

01:46:55.041 --> 01:46:57.144
JUST LIKE THE DECISION TO PAY

01:46:57.210 --> 01:46:59.412
DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS.

01:46:59.479 --> 01:47:01.148
AND BONUSES TO EXECUTIVES TO THE

01:47:01.214 --> 01:47:02.949
VERY EXECUTIVES WHO MADE THESE

01:47:03.016 --> 01:47:04.684
TRADE OFFS.

01:47:04.751 --> 01:47:08.188
WAS NOT OUR DECISION.

01:47:08.255 --> 01:47:10.791
WE NEW BANKRUPTCY.

01:47:10.857 --> 01:47:12.225
WHAT IT MEANT FOR US?

01:47:12.292 --> 01:47:13.860
THERE ARE LEGITIMATE CLAIMS ON

01:47:13.927 --> 01:47:14.928
THIS COMPANY WOULD BE PENNIES ON

01:47:14.995 --> 01:47:16.530
THE DOLLAR.

01:47:16.596 --> 01:47:19.866
THAT'S WHAT WE KNEW.

01:47:19.933 --> 01:47:20.700
AND WE HAVE COME TO THE VERY

01:47:20.767 --> 01:47:22.469
HARD REALIZATION THAT THE ONLY

01:47:22.536 --> 01:47:23.537
THING WORSE THAN AN INEPT

01:47:23.603 --> 01:47:24.671
UTILITY.

01:47:24.738 --> 01:47:28.241
IS A BANKRUPT.

01:47:28.308 --> 01:47:29.176
ONE WHAT DECISIONS AS MY

01:47:29.242 --> 01:47:32.612
COMMUNITY GET TO MAKE.

01:47:32.679 --> 01:47:36.049
HOW TO REBUILD FROM THE ASHES?

01:47:36.116 --> 01:47:38.118
WILL BE AFFORDABLE WOULD BE ABLE

01:47:38.185 --> 01:47:40.754
TO GET INSURANCE.

01:47:40.821 --> 01:47:44.090
HOW DO WE FIX CONTAMINATED WATER?

01:47:44.157 --> 01:47:45.792
WHERE DO WE GO UNTIL THEN HOW DO

01:47:45.859 --> 01:47:46.960
WE PREPARE?

01:47:47.027 --> 01:47:49.763
REPAIR DAMAGED INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:47:49.830 --> 01:47:51.331
THOSE ARE THE DECISIONS THAT MY

01:47:51.398 --> 01:47:54.434
TO MY COMMUNITY GETS TO MAKE.

01:47:54.501 --> 01:47:55.635
HOW DO YOU PREPARE FOR POWER

01:47:55.702 --> 01:47:58.839
SHUT OFFS?

01:47:58.905 --> 01:48:00.106
THESE ARE ALL TOUGH DECISIONS

01:48:00.173 --> 01:48:02.275
WITH NO EASY ANSWERS.

01:48:02.342 --> 01:48:02.843
SO WHAT DO I DO WITH THIS

01:48:02.909 --> 01:48:04.611
PROPOSAL IT'S ANOTHER TOUGH

01:48:04.678 --> 01:48:06.646
DECISION FOR ME.

01:48:06.713 --> 01:48:08.815
A HOBSON'S CHOICE DO I DEAL WITH

01:48:08.882 --> 01:48:11.051
THE DEVIL THAT I KNOW. FOR THE

01:48:11.117 --> 01:48:13.553
DEVIL THAT I DON'T.

01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:15.355
IF WE LET IT ALL CRASH DOWN IT

01:48:15.422 --> 01:48:18.024
WOULD BE JUST DESSERTS. FOR A

01:48:18.091 --> 01:48:19.593
COMPANY THAT HAS BEEN AS NEGLECT

01:48:19.659 --> 01:48:22.596
NEGLIGENT AS THIS.

01:48:22.662 --> 01:48:23.697
ONE BUT WOULD IT BE FAIR FOR THE

01:48:23.763 --> 01:48:26.233
REST OF THE STATE.

01:48:26.299 --> 01:48:29.135
AND I'LL USE THAT SERVE THEM. TO

01:48:29.202 --> 01:48:30.804
SEE THEIR CREDIT DOWNGRADED IT

01:48:30.871 --> 01:48:34.074
TO SEE MORE BANKRUPTCIES.

01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:35.542
WHAT ABOUT THE WORKERS?

01:48:35.609 --> 01:48:36.743
THE LINEMEN IN THE FRONTLINE

01:48:36.810 --> 01:48:38.211
WORKERS.

01:48:38.278 --> 01:48:39.479
THEY LIVE IN MY DISTRICT AND

01:48:39.546 --> 01:48:40.547
THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING TIRE IS

01:48:40.614 --> 01:48:43.216
TIRELESSLY TO RESTORE POWER AND

01:48:43.283 --> 01:48:45.185
TO KEEP THE POWER ON THEY'RE THE

01:48:45.252 --> 01:48:47.220
ONES THAT GO OUT.

01:48:47.287 --> 01:48:50.090
IN THESE DISASTERS IN THE STORMS.

01:48:50.156 --> 01:48:53.660
MAKE SURE IT'S ON SHOULD THEY

01:48:53.727 --> 01:48:54.995
PAY THE PRICE FOR THE BAD

01:48:55.061 --> 01:48:58.531
DECISIONS OF HIGHER UPS. FOR P.

01:48:58.598 --> 01:49:00.133
JEANNIE MAYBE WE SHOULD SEE

01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:01.234
WHAT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS

01:49:01.301 --> 01:49:06.773
BANKRUPTCY.

01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:07.607
MAYBE THEIR ASSETS SHOULD BE

01:49:07.674 --> 01:49:09.609
SOLD. TO SOMEONE MORE

01:49:09.676 --> 01:49:11.044
RESPONSIBLE AND WHO WOULD

01:49:11.111 --> 01:49:12.746
OPERATE MORE EFFICIENTLY MAYBE A

01:49:12.812 --> 01:49:15.582
BREAK UP WOULD BE BETTER.

01:49:15.649 --> 01:49:17.417
BUT I KNOW THAT MANY WHO ARE

01:49:17.484 --> 01:49:18.985
ROOTING FOR THIS BILL TO FAIL.

01:49:19.052 --> 01:49:20.320
WANT TO SEE THE GOVERNMENT TAKE

01:49:20.387 --> 01:49:22.656
OVER P. JEANNIE.

01:49:22.722 --> 01:49:23.924
AND IF THERE'S ONE THING I KNOW

01:49:23.990 --> 01:49:24.958
IF THERE'S ANYTHING WORSE THAN

01:49:25.025 --> 01:49:26.192
BIG GOVERNMENT ARE SORRY BIG

01:49:26.259 --> 01:49:27.494
BUSINESS.

01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:31.031
IS BIG GOVERNMENT.

01:49:31.097 --> 01:49:32.799
IN FACT GOVERNMENT IS THE REASON

01:49:32.866 --> 01:49:34.334
THAT WE IS P. JEANNIE CUSTOMERS

01:49:34.401 --> 01:49:36.670
PAY THE HIGHEST BILLS.

01:49:36.736 --> 01:49:41.107
IN THE NATION.

01:49:41.174 --> 01:49:42.108
AND ALL THE WHILE WILD FIRE

01:49:42.175 --> 01:49:43.710
VICTIMS WOULD MOST ASSUREDLY

01:49:43.777 --> 01:49:46.379
MISS OUT.

01:49:46.446 --> 01:49:47.447
AND THAT'S THE BEST NEWS IT'S IN

01:49:47.514 --> 01:49:49.015
THIS BILL.

01:49:49.082 --> 01:49:50.350
IT PROBABLY MOST EFFECTIVELY

01:49:50.417 --> 01:49:52.085
LEVERAGES THIS COMPANY TO DO

01:49:52.152 --> 01:49:55.221
RIGHT BY THE WILD FIRE VICTIMS.

01:49:55.288 --> 01:49:56.923
IF THEY WANT THE BENEFITS OF

01:49:56.990 --> 01:49:58.692
THIS INSURANCE FUND THEY HAVE TO

01:49:58.758 --> 01:50:00.060
PAY THE VICTIMS AND COME OUT OF

01:50:00.126 --> 01:50:01.928
BANKRUPTCY.

01:50:01.995 --> 01:50:04.097
BY NEXT YEAR NO DRAGGING THEM

01:50:04.164 --> 01:50:06.700
ALONG FOR THE RIDE.

01:50:06.766 --> 01:50:08.034
BUT THERE'S NO GUARANTEE IN THIS

01:50:08.101 --> 01:50:09.235
BILL THAT THE I. O. USE IN THEIR

01:50:09.302 --> 01:50:10.804
SHAREHOLDERS WILL PAY INTO THAT

01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:12.105
FUND.

01:50:12.172 --> 01:50:13.473
ONLY IF THEY ELECT.

01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:15.208
TO AND OF COURSE IT'S NOT LOST

01:50:15.275 --> 01:50:16.509
ON ANY OF US THAT P. JEANNIE

01:50:16.576 --> 01:50:18.812
RIGHT NOW IS ASKING FOR A RATE

01:50:18.878 --> 01:50:20.280
INCREASE.

01:50:20.347 --> 01:50:21.648
FROM OUR RATE PAYERS.

01:50:21.715 --> 01:50:23.717
P. JEANNIE ALSO PROMISES THAT

01:50:23.783 --> 01:50:25.785
SHAREHOLDERS WILL PICK UP.

01:50:25.852 --> 01:50:27.587
THE COST OF PAIN VICTIMS.

01:50:27.654 --> 01:50:29.856
THERE DEBT HOLDERS WOULD RATHER

01:50:29.923 --> 01:50:31.024
DO IT THEMSELVES IN FACT THERE

01:50:31.091 --> 01:50:32.592
WERE THERE READY TO PUT THIRTY

01:50:32.659 --> 01:50:34.260
BILLION DOLLARS IN. TO DO IT

01:50:34.327 --> 01:50:36.129
THEMSELVES.

01:50:36.196 --> 01:50:37.897
IT'S THE FIRST TIME.

01:50:37.964 --> 01:50:39.165
THAT I'VE EVER SEEN SHAREHOLDER

01:50:39.232 --> 01:50:42.035
GROUPS AT PGA ANY FIGHT OVER WHO

01:50:42.102 --> 01:50:43.203
SHOULD PAY.

THE WIND BLOWS.

01:51:36.689 --> 01:51:38.058

THOUGHTFULNESS.

01:52:38.918 --> 01:52:40.053
NOT JUST AS IT RELATES TO THIS

01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:42.422
BILL.

01:52:42.489 --> 01:52:44.324
BUT AS IT'S BEEN.

01:52:44.390 --> 01:52:46.359
SPOKEN OUT BY MANY.

01:52:46.426 --> 01:52:47.594
THIS IS BEEN AN ISSUE THAT WE'VE

01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:48.862

NOT ON THE SURFACE.

01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:55.668
BUT DEEP IN THE DETAILS AND

01:52:55.735 --> 01:52:57.337
THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL.

01:52:57.403 --> 01:52:58.738
THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE SUBJECT OF

01:52:58.805 --> 01:53:00.974
CONVERSATION.

01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:03.443
OFFICIAL THROUGH A COMMITTEE

OF CONCEPTS [inaudible]

01:53:12.051 --> 01:53:14.854
BUT ALSO [inaudible]

01:53:14.921 --> 01:53:16.656

ENOUGH TO GET TOGETHER AND SAY

01:53:20.693 --> 01:53:23.062
WHAT CAN WE DO HOW CAN WE START

01:53:23.129 --> 01:53:24.864
TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING.

01:53:24.931 --> 01:53:26.299
OF THE LARGER PICTURE AND HOW

01:53:26.366 --> 01:53:28.134
IT'S IMPACTING.

01:53:28.201 --> 01:53:29.536
ON THE STATE OF AFFAIRS AS IT

01:53:29.602 --> 01:53:31.905
RELATES TO WILDFIRES DEVASTATING

01:53:31.971 --> 01:53:33.439
OUR COMMUNITY AND THE VICTIMS.

01:53:33.506 --> 01:53:38.511

01:53:48.221 --> 01:53:49.422
AND AS MANY OF YOU POINTED OUT

01:53:49.489 --> 01:53:50.690
THERE'S STILL A LOT OF OTHER

01:53:50.757 --> 01:53:51.925
ELEMENTS THAT NEED TO BE

01:53:51.991 --> 01:53:53.459
ADDRESSED.

01:53:53.526 --> 01:53:55.195
AND MANY OF THOSE CAN PROBABLY

01:53:55.261 --> 01:53:56.930
BE ADDRESSED.

01:53:56.996 --> 01:53:59.232
BEFORE THE END OF THE SESSION.

01:53:59.299 --> 01:54:00.667
MANY OF YOU HAVE LEGISLATION

01:54:00.733 --> 01:54:02.101
THAT STILL MOVING THAT HAS THE

01:54:02.168 --> 01:54:03.102
ABILITY TO CONTINUE THE

01:54:03.169 --> 01:54:05.138
CONVERSATION AND NO ONE HAS EVER

01:54:05.205 --> 01:54:07.407
SAID THIS BILL IS GOING TO BE.

01:54:07.473 --> 01:54:08.608
THE SILVER BULLET.

01:54:08.675 --> 01:54:11.277
OR THE FIX ALL.

01:54:11.344 --> 01:54:13.313

IN DRAMATIC LEAPS. TO WHERE WE

01:54:17.283 --> 01:54:20.954

WITH THE FUND.

01:54:40.573 --> 01:54:42.508
TALKING ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD LOOK

01:54:42.575 --> 01:54:45.278
AT CREATING SOME TYPE OF A EARLY

01:54:45.345 --> 01:54:48.281
ON OFFSET.

01:54:48.348 --> 01:54:51.985
SO THEY HAD BILLS IN MOTION.

01:54:52.051 --> 01:54:53.019
THE GOVERNOR'S TEAM CAME

01:54:53.086 --> 01:54:56.189
TOGETHER AND TOOK THOSE CONCEPTS

01:54:56.256 --> 01:54:56.823

01:55:01.728 --> 01:55:03.596
DIRECTION.

01:55:03.663 --> 01:55:05.131

01:55:05.198 --> 01:55:05.932
TO GO.

01:55:05.999 --> 01:55:07.533

02:05:32.691 --> 02:05:34.627
SITE I MET WITH THE PROJECT

02:05:34.693 --> 02:05:35.895
DIRECTORS AND THE MANAGERS.

02:05:35.961 --> 02:05:37.029
THEY ANSWERED MY QUESTIONS AS

02:05:37.096 --> 02:05:38.230
BEST THEY COULD IT WASN'T GOOD

02:05:38.297 --> 02:05:40.165
ENOUGH FOR ME SO I ASKED TO

02:05:40.232 --> 02:05:42.167
SPEAK WITH THE ENGINEERS I SPENT

02:05:42.234 --> 02:05:44.236
MANY HOURS WITH THE ENGINEERS

02:05:44.303 --> 02:05:44.770
ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

02:05:44.837 --> 02:05:45.804
PROJECT.

02:05:45.871 --> 02:05:47.373
BASICALLY THIS AREA OF MY

02:05:47.439 --> 02:05:48.674
DISTRICT IS AN ENORMOUS

02:05:48.741 --> 02:05:50.376
WATERSHED IN WATER FLOWS

02:05:50.442 --> 02:05:51.844
UNDERGROUND FROM THE HIGHER

02:05:51.911 --> 02:05:53.178
ELEVATIONS DOWN INTO THE LOWER

02:05:53.245 --> 02:05:54.680
ELEVATIONS.

02:05:54.747 --> 02:05:56.282
AND EVENTUALLY THE WATER

02:05:56.348 --> 02:05:59.351
PERCOLATES UP INTO THESE VAST.

02:05:59.418 --> 02:06:01.153
DRY LAKE BEDS WHERE IT

02:06:01.220 --> 02:06:02.554
EVAPORATES IN THE ATMOSPHERE

02:06:02.621 --> 02:06:04.356
THESE LAKE BEDS ARE VERY BRINY

02:06:04.423 --> 02:06:05.457
BECAUSE OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS

02:06:05.524 --> 02:06:06.825
THE WATER EVAPORATION OF THE

02:06:06.892 --> 02:06:08.027
WATER HAS LEFT FOR A BLOCK

02:06:08.093 --> 02:06:09.561
BEHIND MINERAL CONTENT.

02:06:09.628 --> 02:06:10.930
SO THE MOMENT THAT WATER HITS

02:06:10.996 --> 02:06:13.098
THAT BRIAN IT'S UNFIT FOR HUMAN

02:06:13.165 --> 02:06:14.533
CONSUMPTION AFFECT ITS MUCH

02:06:14.600 --> 02:06:16.368
SALTIER THAN THE OCEAN EVEN

02:06:16.435 --> 02:06:18.904
BIRDS AND WILDLIFE CANNOT DRINK

02:06:18.971 --> 02:06:20.839
IT.

02:06:20.906 --> 02:06:23.042
YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD PEOPLE SAY.

02:06:23.108 --> 02:06:24.843
ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS.

02:06:24.910 --> 02:06:26.712
REGARDING BIGHORN SHEEP AND THE

02:06:26.779 --> 02:06:28.247
DRYING UP OF NATURAL SPRINGS BUT

02:06:28.314 --> 02:06:29.748
I CAN TELL YOU HAVING BEEN OUT

02:06:29.815 --> 02:06:30.749
THERE THAT IS COMPLETE.

02:06:30.816 --> 02:06:32.217
HOGWASH.

02:06:32.284 --> 02:06:34.820
THIS THOSE SITES ARE THOUSANDS

02:06:34.887 --> 02:06:36.121
OF VERTICAL SPEED FEED COP THE

02:06:36.188 --> 02:06:38.590
WATERSHED FROM THE EXTRACTION

02:06:38.657 --> 02:06:39.258
SITE.

02:06:39.325 --> 02:06:40.759
WHAT THE KATIE'S PROJECT IS

02:06:40.826 --> 02:06:42.795
PROPOSING TO DO IS TO EXTRACT

02:06:42.861 --> 02:06:45.397
THAT WATER BEFORE IT GETS TO THE

02:06:45.464 --> 02:06:47.299
BRINY -- DRY LAKE BEDS AND

02:06:47.366 --> 02:06:48.767
EVAPORATES INTO THE ATMOSPHERE.

02:06:48.834 --> 02:06:50.669
SO IT CAN'T POSSIBLY HAVE ANY

02:06:50.736 --> 02:06:53.505
AFFECT ON THESE UPSTREAM USES

02:06:53.572 --> 02:06:53.806
[inaudible]

02:06:53.872 --> 02:06:56.008
ALSO.

02:06:56.075 --> 02:06:59.144
IF YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT MAYBE

02:06:59.211 --> 02:07:00.980
THE OVER PUMPING OF WATER OUT OF

02:07:01.046 --> 02:07:02.214
THAT SITE IF YOU'VE CONCERN OF

02:07:02.281 --> 02:07:03.382
THE MAYBE THE ENGINEERS GOT THE

02:07:03.449 --> 02:07:04.850
HYDROLOGY ROCK WHICH IS A

02:07:04.917 --> 02:07:06.151
CONCERN THAT I HAVE.

02:07:06.218 --> 02:07:07.653
YOU SHOULD TAKE SOME COMFORT AS

02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:09.188
I DO IN THE FACT THAT WHEN THE

02:07:09.254 --> 02:07:10.889
COUNTY OF SAN BENITO EXAMINE

02:07:10.956 --> 02:07:11.824
THIS PROJECT.

02:07:11.890 --> 02:07:14.960
THEY PUT A STRICT REQUIREMENT ON

02:07:15.027 --> 02:07:16.395
THE TOPIC OF THE WATER AND IF

02:07:16.462 --> 02:07:18.397
THE WATER LEVEL IN THE WATER

02:07:18.464 --> 02:07:20.699
TABLE GETS ONE INCH BELOW.

02:07:20.766 --> 02:07:22.201
WHAT THE KATIE'S ENGINEERS

02:07:22.267 --> 02:07:23.769
PREDICT THAT IT WILL BE?

02:07:23.836 --> 02:07:25.037
THEY HAVE TO IMMEDIATELY STOP

02:07:25.104 --> 02:07:26.105
POPPING SO ANOTHER WORDS IF

02:07:26.171 --> 02:07:27.840
THEY'RE WRONG ABOUT THE FACT

02:07:27.906 --> 02:07:29.174
THAT THIS ISN'T GOING TO IMPACT

02:07:29.241 --> 02:07:30.209
THE ENVIRONMENT THEY MUST

02:07:30.275 --> 02:07:32.611
IMMEDIATELY STOP POPPING AND

02:07:32.678 --> 02:07:33.145
WE'RE GOING TO STOP AND RE

02:07:33.212 --> 02:07:35.114
EVALUATE THAT.

02:07:35.180 --> 02:07:36.682
SO I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE

02:07:36.749 --> 02:07:38.984
FACT THAT WE OFTEN HAVE

02:07:39.051 --> 02:07:40.419
DISAGREEMENTS DISCUSSIONS IN

02:07:40.486 --> 02:07:41.720
THIS CHAMBER ABOUT WATER AND A

02:07:41.787 --> 02:07:42.621
LOT.

02:07:42.688 --> 02:07:43.555
OF THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THE

02:07:43.622 --> 02:07:45.057
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS ARGUMENTS

02:07:45.124 --> 02:07:46.458
ABOUT WATER BETWEEN NORTHERN

02:07:46.525 --> 02:07:47.259
CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHERN

02:07:47.326 --> 02:07:49.061
CALIFORNIA SO WE'VE HAD INTENSE

02:07:49.128 --> 02:07:50.863
DEBATES ABOUT THE DELTA TITLES

02:07:50.929 --> 02:07:51.597
AND ALL OF THESE CONVEYANCE

02:07:51.663 --> 02:07:53.632
MECHANISMS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

02:07:53.699 --> 02:07:55.401
A PROJECT THAT'S ALREADY LOCATED

02:07:55.467 --> 02:07:56.835
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT WILL

02:07:56.902 --> 02:07:58.504
CREATE MILLIONS OF GALLONS OF

02:07:58.570 --> 02:08:01.306
WATER FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION AND

02:08:01.373 --> 02:08:01.907
WE'RE GOING TO TELL THEM NO.

02:08:01.974 --> 02:08:04.143
BECAUSE OF THIS.

02:08:04.209 --> 02:08:05.644
AND LASTLY I WANT YOU TO THINK

02:08:05.711 --> 02:08:07.012
ABOUT THE TERRIBLE PRECEDENT

02:08:07.079 --> 02:08:08.113
THAT WE'RE SETTING HERE THIS IS

02:08:08.180 --> 02:08:09.648
A PROJECT THAT IS ALREADY GONE

02:08:09.715 --> 02:08:11.850
THROUGH NUMEROUS LEVELS OF

02:08:11.917 --> 02:08:13.152
INTENSE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AT

02:08:13.218 --> 02:08:14.453
THE FEDERAL LEVEL AT THE STATE

02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:15.254
LEVEL.

02:08:15.320 --> 02:08:16.655
AT THE COUNTY LEVEL THEY HAVE

02:08:16.722 --> 02:08:18.424
JUMP THROUGH EVERY SINGLE HOOP

02:08:18.490 --> 02:08:18.991
THE GOVERNMENT COULD PUT IN

02:08:19.058 --> 02:08:20.592
FRONT OF THEM.

02:08:20.659 --> 02:08:22.694
SO WHAT WE'RE TELLING PEOPLE IF

02:08:22.761 --> 02:08:24.396
WE PASS THIS BILL TODAY.

02:08:24.463 --> 02:08:26.165
IS THAT NONE OF THAT MATTERS AND

02:08:26.231 --> 02:08:27.599
THAT IF ENOUGH POWERFULLY

02:08:27.666 --> 02:08:29.234
CONNECTED PEOPLE GET TOGETHER.

02:08:29.301 --> 02:08:30.502
THEY CAN SPONSOR A BILL IN THE

02:08:30.569 --> 02:08:33.439
LEGISLATURE. TO STOP ANY PROJECT.

02:08:33.505 --> 02:08:35.240
SO I ASK YOU IF WE SET THAT

02:08:35.307 --> 02:08:37.443
PRECEDENT WHAT COMES NEXT.

02:08:37.509 --> 02:08:38.844
IF A GROUP WANTS TO STOP AN

02:08:38.911 --> 02:08:40.145
INFORMAL HOUSING PROJECT IN

02:08:40.212 --> 02:08:41.713
THEIR DISTRICT.

02:08:41.780 --> 02:08:42.681
IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD CAN THEY

02:08:42.748 --> 02:08:43.782
DO THAT CAN THEY RUN A BILL LIKE

02:08:43.849 --> 02:08:45.617
THIS PUT AN INVITE ADDITIONAL

02:08:45.684 --> 02:08:47.252
ENVIRONMENTAL HURDLES IN PLACE

02:08:47.319 --> 02:08:47.853
WHAT ABOUT THE ACCESS TO THE

02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:48.954
COAST.

02:08:49.021 --> 02:08:49.988
CAN WEALTHY PEOPLE ON THE COAST

02:08:50.055 --> 02:08:51.690
LINE PETITION AND HAVE A BILL

02:08:51.757 --> 02:08:52.791
BROUGHT FORWARD.

02:08:52.858 --> 02:08:54.193
THIS IS NOT A DIRECTION THAT WE

02:08:54.259 --> 02:08:55.961
WANT TO GO.

02:08:56.028 --> 02:08:57.029
I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE

02:08:57.096 --> 02:08:58.664
FACT THAT THIS CREATES MILLIONS

02:08:58.730 --> 02:09:00.365
OF GALLONS.

02:09:00.432 --> 02:09:02.801
OF WATER FOR HUMAN USE THAT

02:09:02.868 --> 02:09:05.104
WOULD OTHERWISE BE LOST TO

02:09:05.170 --> 02:09:06.505
EVAPORATION THE ATMOSPHERE.

02:09:06.572 --> 02:09:08.140
IT'S HAD NUMEROUS ENVIRONMENTAL

02:09:08.207 --> 02:09:09.775
REVIEWS AND THERE ARE STRICT

02:09:09.842 --> 02:09:11.810
COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS I URGE A

02:09:11.877 --> 02:09:13.812
NO VOTE ON THIS TERRIBLE

02:09:13.879 --> 02:09:16.782
PRECEDENT SETTING BILL.

02:09:16.849 --> 02:09:17.716

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER.

02:09:21.186 --> 02:09:23.288
I RISE IN OPPOSITION SB THREE OH

02:09:23.355 --> 02:09:24.189
SEVEN IT SEEKS TO STOP TO

02:09:24.256 --> 02:09:25.791
KATIE'S PROJECT IN THE LIMITED A

02:09:25.858 --> 02:09:27.726
WATER THEY CAN MEET THE NEEDS OF

02:09:27.793 --> 02:09:28.260
FOUR THOUSAND CALIFORNIA'S

02:09:28.327 --> 02:09:29.294
ANNUALLY.

02:09:29.361 --> 02:09:30.762
THE PROJECT IMPROVES LOCAL WATER

02:09:30.829 --> 02:09:32.364
SUPPLY RIGHT LIABILITY AND

02:09:32.431 --> 02:09:34.766
REDUCES DEMAND FOR OUR AREA FROM

02:09:34.833 --> 02:09:37.769
DELTA AND COLORADO RIVER WATER --

02:09:37.836 --> 02:09:39.738
KATIE'S AS BEEN SAID IS LOCATED

02:09:39.805 --> 02:09:42.107
A SOLID CALIFORNIANS LESS ENERGY

02:09:42.174 --> 02:09:43.642
NEEDED TO TRANSPORT THE WATER.

02:09:43.709 --> 02:09:45.177
THIS MANAGES ENERGY DEMANDS

02:09:45.244 --> 02:09:46.912
REDUCES A MICHELIN STABILIZES

02:09:46.979 --> 02:09:48.647
WATER RATES THE PROJECT WOULD

02:09:48.714 --> 02:09:50.616
CREATE A SUPPORT OVER FIFTY NINE

02:09:50.682 --> 02:09:52.851
HUNDRED JOBS GENERATE MORE THAN
