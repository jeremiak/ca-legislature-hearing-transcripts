I'M THRILLED TO BE HERE THANK YOU FOR THE COURTESY OF LETTING ME GO FIRST I'M CERTAINLY GLAD I'M NOT HERE. LATER IN THE MONTH. HI I'M I'M REALLY PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT -- SENATE BILL FOUR FIFTY ONE THIS MEASURE WOULD CREATE AN INCENTIVE FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A TAX CREDIT FOR THE PRESERVATION. AND REHABILITATION OF HISTORIC BUILDINGS IN CALIFORNIA. IF ENACTED CALIFORNIA WOULD JOIN THIRTY FIVE OTHER STATES WITH STATE HISTORIC TAX CREDIT PROGRAMS. A STATE HISTORIC TAX CREDIT WOULD HELP TO STIMULATE LOCAL ECONOMIES AND REVITALIZE DOWNTOWN AREAS. THROUGHOUT OUR STATE IN THIS MEASURE ESTABLISHES ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA. THAT ENSURE IT WILL ALSO. INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- SUPPORT SMART GROWTH THROUGH INFILL DEVELOPMENT AND ENCOURAGE PROPERTY MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION IN ECONOMICALLY DEPRESSED AREAS TAX CREDITS A PROVEN TO WORK IN ALL OF THESE CASES AND WE CAN GIVE YOU. EXAMPLE AFTER EXAMPLE OF SUCCESSFUL PROJECTS THAT SHOW ALL OF THESE THINGS. SP FOUR FIFTY ONE I IS CAREFULLY CONSTRUCTED TO ENSURE TRANSPARENCY BUT TASKING THE OFFICE OF HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND THE TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE HOUSE IN OUR TREASURER'S OFFICE. TO ENSURE THAT ONLY DESERVING PROJECTS WILL BE AWARDED THE TAX CREDIT. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL CONTAINS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE LA -- AND THE ANNUAL AGGREGATE CAP OF FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR FIVE YEARS. BY ENABLING CALIFORNIANS TO LEVERAGE FEDERAL REHABILITATION TAX CREDITS IT'S OUR HOPE THAT THIS MEASURE WILL PROVIDE THE EXTRA INCENTIVE NECESSARY TO STIMULATE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INVESTMENTS. WHILE ALSO BUILDING ON CIVIC PRIDE AS WE CELEBRATE OUR HERITAGE AND PRESERVE CALIFORNIA'S PAST. I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN -- AND CERTAINLY COMMITTEE STAFFER IDENTIFYING SOME AMENDMENTS REFLECTED -- IN COMMENTS FIVE AN AIDE IN THE ANALYSIS AND I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS TODAY BUT I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH THE CHAIRMAN. ON ISSUES RELATED TO LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS -- A AND I KNOW I TO JOIN THE CHAIRMAN IN WANTING TO VERY NARROWLY DEFINED THIS BECAUSE I THINK HOMEOWNERS -- YOU SHOULD BE REVIEWED VERY CAREFULLY -- BUT I DO KNOW THAT THAT THERE ARE OWNERS OF HISTORIC HOMES THAT WERE ABLE TO PURCHASE THEIR HOMES. IN TIMES WHEN CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING MARKET IS NOT WHAT IT IS TODAY I CAN POINT TO EXAMPLES OF HOMES. IN MY COMMUNITY IN SAN DIEGO THERE PART OF HISTORIC DISTRICTS BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT ONE HOUSE THAT OBVIOUSLY SOMEBODY BOUGHT IT DECADES AGO AND THEY DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROTECT THE HISTORICITY OF THAT HOME. I WOULD LIKE NARROWLY DEFINED OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE HOME OWNERS. TO NOT -- CONTRIBUTE TO OR TOWARDS THE DEGRADATION OF A DISTRICT SO IF WE CAN BETWEEN NOW AND THE APPROPRIATIONS I WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE CHAIRMAN AND HIS INCREDIBLE STAFF. TO MORE NARROWLY DEFINED THAT FOR THE PURPOSE -- THAT MEETS THE INTENT OF OF THE YOU KNOW THE RESPONSIBILITY WE HAVE IN THAT AREA. BUT WITH THAT. I APPRECIATE YOUR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS I DO THINK THIS IS. AN IMPORTANT PROJECT AND I'M THRILLED TODAY TO SEE THAT OUR STATE TREASURER -- FIONA MA IS HERE TO TESTIFY ALONG WITH SEVERAL OF THE OTHER FOLKS MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU AN IMPORTANT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK -- WITH THE PRO TEAM IN HER FANTASTIC TEAM ON THE PUBLIC BENEFIT PORTION OF THE BILL AND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR ALL OF HER WORK AND HER WILLINGNESS IS WELL.

THANK YOU -- CENTER MCGUIRE AND AND THEY'RE MORE LOCK UP HAPPY TO BE HERE TO BE OF SERVICE TO WORK WITH. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH -- PRESIDENT PRO TEM ATKINS OUR OFFICE ADMINISTERS THE NINE AND 4% AFFORDABLE HOUSING TAX CREDITS AND THESE DAYS IT IS MORE AND MORE. ARE COSTLY TO DEVELOP AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- AND THE LINE THE LINE FOR THE 9% AFFORDABLE TAX CREDITS IS VERY VERY LONG AND WE CAN'T ACCOMMODATE EVERYONE. SO WE THINK THIS IDEA IS IS VERY NOVEL IT AFFORDS MORE FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO USE A STATE TAX CREDIT PERHAPS IN CONJUNCTION WITH. OUR FEDERAL TAX CREDIT TO REHAB AND PRESERVE THESE HISTORIC BUILDING SO IT WOULD. GO A LONG WAY I THINK TO PRESERVING MANY OF THESE BUILDINGS INTO A RE PURPOSED THEM TO A HIGHER AND BEST USE THAT MEETS TODAY'S CURRENT NEEDS. TRICIA MY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US TODAY. GOOD MORNING SIR WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO TO TESTIFY -- I MEAN THAT IS IT ON WITH -- DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT THE CALL FOR A TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION IN AS THE TRIGGER STATED -- WE ADMINISTER THE FEDERAL AND STATE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROGRAM. IT JUST WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. TO FILL FINANCING GAPS ON PROJECTS THAT MIGHT NOT BE OTHERWISE. BE ABLE TO GET DONE SO. I THINK THAT THE RESOURCE WOULD BE HELD. THANK YOU SO MUCH -- REGRETFULLY HERE TODAY. PLEASE EXAMINE WE NOW WOULD LIKE TO BE AT OPENING UP FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE YOU STATE YOUR FIRST AND LAST NAME AS WELL AS YOUR POSITION. FIRST MY SAME POSITION GOOD MORNING MA'AM WELCOME COMMITTEE GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS CINDY HEIGHTS MAN. I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA PRESERVATION FOUNDATION. I WOULD LIKE TO THANKS SENATE PRO TEM MACHEN'S SADDAM ACQUIRING COMMITTEE MEMBERS IT IS MY HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PRESERVATION FOUNDATION I SEEK YOUR SUPPORT OF S. BEFORE. FIFTY ONE THE STORE BUILDINGS REHABILITATION TAX CREDIT. IN CALIFORNIA SOME OF OUR MOST BELOVED LANDMARKS ARE RESTORED AND USEFUL TODAY BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL TAX CREDITS HISTORIC BUILDINGS REHABILITATED WITH NEW USES. ARE NOT ONLY IMPORTANT TO MEETING HOUSING AND SUSTAINABILITY GOALS BUT INCREASES OUR RESILIENCE. IN THE FACE OF DISASTER. A REHABILITATED BUILDING IS TRANSFORMED FROM UNDER USE UNDERPERFORMING BUILDING TO A SAFER BUILDING BY APPROVING IT SEISMIC RESISTANCE FAR PROTECTIONS AND SYSTEMS INFRASTRUCTURE WHILE PRESERVING COMMUNITY CHARACTER AND FUSING NEW ECONOMIC VITALITY INTO AN AREA. SOME FEATURES OF THIS BILL INSURE THAT THE BILL IS EQUITABLE. 5% BONUSES FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF PROJECTS AND A TEN MILLION DOLLARS SET ASIDE FOR SMALL PROJECTS UNDER MILLION DOLLARS. SINCE TWO THOUSAND TO AN AVERAGE OF TEN REHABILITATION PROJECTS PER YEAR USE FEDERAL HISTORIC TAX CREDITS IN CALIFORNIA. FROM 200-022-00016 FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL TAX CREDITS. CATALYZED ONE HUNDRED SIXTY NINE PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA TOTALING TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN QUALIFYING REHABILITATION EXPENDITURES. A CALIFORNIA START TAX CREDIT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF HISTORIC BUILDING REHABILITATION PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA. HERE ARE A FEW EXAMPLES FROM OTHER STATES THAT HAVE A STATE HISTORIC TAX CREDIT. OUR RECORDS UNIVERSITY STUDY OF THE KANSAS HISTORIC TAX CREDIT FOUND THAT THE TWENTY ONE YEAR PERIOD BEFORE THEIR STATE TAX CREDIT WAS IN PLACE. THERE WAS AN AVERAGE OF TWO POINT FOUR FEDERAL HISTORIC TAX CREDIT PROJECTS PER YEAR. WITH AN AGGREGATE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS INVESTMENT. IN THE EIGHT YEARS FOLLOWING THE ENACTMENT OF A HISTORIC STATE TAX CREDIT CANCER SO A TOTAL OF CREDIT PROJECTS. COMPLETED OR AN AVERAGE OF SIXTY EIGHT PER YEAR. REPRESENTING IN AGGREGATE INVESTMENT OF TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN BUILDING REHABILITATION. THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA CITY STORE TAX CREDIT PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT NOTES THAT QUOTE. THE AVERAGE HISTORIC REHABILITATION PROJECT HAS QUADRUPLED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. OF THE TOTAL DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT HAS INCREASED EIGHTY TWO TIMES FROM JUST OVER ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN. TWO THOUSAND FIVE TO EIGHTY FIVE POINT NINE MILLION IN. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN EXCEPTIONALLY SUCCESSFUL INCREASING INVESTMENT IN HISTORIC REHABILITATION AND OKLAHOMA. END QUOTE. BEFORE ENACTMENT OF THEIR STATE HISTORIC TAX CREDIT TEXAS AVERAGE THREE PROJECTS PER YEAR. BUT ACCORDING TO THIS TASK THIS HISTORIC COMMISSION. THE NEW HISTORIC TAX CREDIT HAS DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF PROJECTS QUALIFYING FOR THE FEDERAL TAX CREDITS FOR EXAMPLE. BETWEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AND TWO THOUSAND SEVEN A TWENTY YEAR PERIOD HOUSTON HAD FORTY CERTIFIED HISTORIC TAX CREDITS WITH THE TOTAL QUALIFIED REHABILITATION EXPENDITURE IN THE AMOUNT OF TWO HUNDRED SEVENTEEN MILLION. SENSOR STATE HISTORIC TAX CREDIT WENT INTO EFFECT IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN THEY HAVE TWELVE ACTIVE PROJECTS THIS IS IN HOUSTON ALONE. BEING CERTIFIED FOR THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT WITH AN ESTIMATED COST OF TWO HUNDRED FOURTEEN MILLION. THESE REHABILITATION PROJECTS WERE NOT HAPPENING WHICH IS THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT PROGRAM. IT WAS ONLY THE COMBINATION OF THE STATE AND FEDERAL TAX CREDIT PROGRAM PROGRAM THAT MADE THESE REHABILITATION PROJECTS FINANCIALLY VIABLE. I MUST NOTE THAT IN ADDITION TO CALIFORNIA TENNESSEE A HAWAII. ALSO HAVE TAX CREDIT BILLS INTRODUCED IN THEIR LEGISLATURE NOW. EXPERIENCE FROM OTHER STATES SHOW THAT SHORT TERM LOSS OF STATE TAX REVENUE IS RECOVERED IMMEDIATELY DURING CONSTRUCTION AND FULLY WITHIN A MATTER OF YEARS ACCORDING TO MULTIPLE ECONOMIC ASSESSMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE THE MARYLAND GOVERNOR'S TASK FORCE FOUND THAT FOR EVERY DOLLAR PAID OUT BY THE STATE. THIRTY FOUR CENTS WAS RETURNED DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE. IN OHIO CLEVELAND STATE UNIVERSITY FOUND THAT THE OHIO PROGRAM RECEIVED. THIRTY THREE CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR INVESTED BECAUSE THE TAXES ON CONSTRUCTION LABOR MATERIALS. FOR EVERY DOLLAR TAX CREDIT AWARDED THE LOUISIANA TREASURY RECEIVE FORTY TWO CENTS BEFORE DEVELOPER OWNER CAN EVEN USE THE CREDIT. AND THE STUDY OF TWENTY FIVE REHABILITATION PROJECTS UNDERTAKEN IN WISCONSIN. IN NIGHT TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ESTIMATED THAT THE STATE WOULD RECEIVE FORTY CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE. TO RECOVER THE STATE'S INVESTMENT VARIES FROM NINE YEARS AS REPORTED IN VIRGINIA TO FOUR YEARS AS REPORTED IN WISCONSIN. THIS IS AFTER THE BUILDINGS ARE PUT INTO SERVICE. THINK OF STORE TAX CREDITS WILL PRESERVE HISTORIC PLACES. PROVIDE JOBS [inaudible] INCREASE HOUSING. ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL VITALITY TO ENSURE THAT OUR SHARED HERITAGE. IN JURORS FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO JOINING THIRTY FIVE OTHER STATES. WHO HAVE SUCCESSFUL STATE HISTORIC TAX CREDIT PROGRAMS AND SEEK YOUR SUPPORT OF SB?

WE NOW LIKE YOU BETTER BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR CONVERSATION. TO ANY QUESTIONS OUR CONVERSATION OR EMOTION WE HAVE CENTER BELL. AT MY SCHOOL ARRIVE ALUMNI OF THIS OUT OF THE STATE -- THERE IS A HUGE PROBLEM WITH HOMELESS STUDENTS -- WHEN I TALK TO OTHER CAMPUSES AROUND THE STATE? A SIMILAR PROBLEM. I THINK TO CLOSE OUR EYES AND NOR THIS. ANYMORE. ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- A BOND IS GOING ON THE BALLOT TO IMPROVE FACILITIES. WITHOUT DEALING WITH -- THE SUBJECT MATTER OF HOMELESS OF STUDENTS [inaudible] OF IT I THINK IT HAS TO BE INCLUDED SOMEHOW -- I WANT TO KNOW WHAT PEOPLE'S THOUGHTS ARE ABOUT. WHAT'S GOING ON TO HELP THE HOMELESS STUDENTS AND SHOULD WE INCLUDE. IN THIS BOND -- OKAY YOU KNOW JUST -- ELIGIBLE ACTIVITY. IT IT DOESN'T SPECIFICALLY SAY HOUSING FOR STUDENTS AND FACULTY BUT QUITE FRANKLY AND SOUNDS A AND PROBABLY OTHER AREAS -- YOU HAVE THE HOUSING. PEOPLE RIGHT HERE ON THE COMMITTEE WAS CENTER WINNERS CENTER CHOIR MYSELF [inaudible] OF CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO. WITH THIS BOND I THINK THE BAR WOULD BE MORE ATTRACTIVE. IF IT PROVIDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR STUDENTS BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY WHAT HAPPENS TO THE STUDENTS. IS IF THEY DON'T HAVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THEY HAVE TO GO OUT AND BORROW MONEY TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR LIVING EXPENSES. AND THAT JUST GOING OUT AND GETTING A LOAN AND IT -- I FIND AMOUNT OF STUDENT LOANS IN THIS COUNTRY SHAMEFUL. THERE WERE NOT SUPPORTING THE OUR STUDENTS BETTER [inaudible] WITH -- EDUCATION THAT'S AFFORDABLE SO. THE HOUSING COST IS -- PART OF THE BIG PART OF THAT. SO COULD YOU ADDRESS THAT ISSUE I REMEMBER HOW HARD IT WAS WORKINGAS A STUDENT IN -- IN A FINE IN THE FIGHT WITH FINANCIAL AID AS A STUDENT MYSELF WITH FINANCIAL AID -- PAYING MY WAY THROUGH SCHOOL. AND TRYING TO FIND HOUSING THAT'S AFFORDABLE FOR THE STUDENTS -- AND I ACTUALLY BECAME THE STUDENT HOUSING COORDINATOR AT SAN JOSE STATE. THAT WAS MY FIRST AREA OF INTEREST IN POLITICS. OF SO I I I I DON'T HONESTLY HAVE A VERY SINCERE [inaudible] BELIEVE THAT. IT'S TIME TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS IN A BIGGER WAY SO. YOU'RE YOU'RE THE ONES THAT CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE I WANT TO HEAR. MOVIES CENTER GLAZIERS -- NASDAQ AS THE SAN DIEGO STATE -- MAN SO I LIKE TO HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER THOUGHTS ON THIS SUBJECT. THROUGH THE CHAIR. THAT WAS SENATOR ABOUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR QUESTION AND CERTAINLY -- THERE'S A FEW MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AT WHO'S BEEN IT. AS AN ARTICULATE AND ENERGETIC LEADERS YOU HAVE BEEN ON THIS ISSUE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT. THAT WHAT ARE SOO STUDENTS ARE EXPERIENCING A NOW -- AT SO MANY OF OUR CAMPUSES IS -- IS THIS IS MORE THAN UNCOMFORTABLE IT'S IT'S UPSETTING. AND IT'S DISAPPOINTING I EAT AND WE BOTH KNOW THIS S A MUCH BROADER ISSUE THAN SOMETHING THAT THE UNIVERSITY -- HAS CREATED ON ITS OWN IT'S A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THAT WE WE SEE THROUGHOUT OUR STATED AT EVERY LEVEL A LITTLE AT THE SEGMENTS TALK ABOUT IT IN REGARD TO THEIR PARTICULAR -- AUTHORIZATION OTHER OR THE LIKE -- I AM I AM A VERY OPEN TO THAT CONVERSATION ABOUT IT I HAD NO ONE HAS RAISED IT BEFORE -- AND I WOULD WELCOME THE THE CONVERSATION I'D LIKE TO DEFER TO BITE THE SEGMENTS TO ADDRESS IT AS THEY AS THEY SEE FIT AS WELL. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THE FIRST A CRACK AT CENTER THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION VERY MUCH AND CLEARLY -- WHETHER IT'S AUSTIN HOMELESSNESS OR STUDENT FOOD INSECURITY -- YOU KNOW THE UNIVERSITY IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THESE ISSUES AS THE IMPACT OUR STUDENTS. I WOULD SAY THAT ON THE THE ISSUE OF FOOD SECURITY THE UNIVERSITY IS -- WORKING VERY HARD TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THERE TO BE FOOD PANTRIES AND THE LIKE SO THAT THE BASIC NEEDS CAN BE MET FOR STUDENTS. I KNOW -- COLLEAGUES IN MY OFFICE OR WORKING WITH MEMBERS LIKE SENATOR DODD THIS YEAR ON EFFORTS THAT WOULD EXPAND -- CAL FRESH BENEFITS TO THE STUDENTS AND SO FORTH SO THERE ARE ONGOING ACTIVITIES IN THAT RESPECT WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING. I HAD MENTIONED THAT -- NEAR THE UNIVERSITY IS ABLE TO BORROW NOW -- FOR A STUDENT HOUSING AND THE PRESENT APARTADO HAS STATED THAT HER GOAL TO HAVE THE UNIVERSITY AT THOUSANDS OF ADDITIONAL BEDS ON CAMPUS SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE. OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS TO BE ENROLLED IN AND HOUSED ON CAMPUS THAT THEY'RE NOT COMPETING FOR THOSE LIMITED SPACES THAT ARE YOU KNOW COMING IN AT THE HIGHER AND HIGHER LEVELS. OUTSIDE THE CAMPUS -- BUT BUT THOSE ABILITY THE ABILITY TO BUILD THOSE PROJECTS IS OF A MARK IN OUR MIND SEPARATE INSTINCT FROM. THE TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WITH REGARD -- TO THE BOND THAT WE'RE BRINGING FORWARD TODAY NO NO -- JUST RESPOND TO THAT. YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE STUDIED THE HOUSING ISSUE OF ON THE CAMPUS IS PRETTY CLOSELY IN -- THE AND I DON'T KNOW. IF YOU HAVE. A LIST OF HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO LIVE ON THE ON CAMPUS HOUSING AROUND THE THE VARIOUS UNIVERSITY THIS PUBLIC OUR PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES IN CALIFORNIA. BUT I KNOW IN -- SAN JOSE THAT -- THE RATE AT THE DORMITORY IS LIKE SIXTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. OR I MEAN MAYBE THE STUDENTS CAN TELL US SOME OF THOSE THINGS BUT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU THERE'S BEEN A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY. BUT WHAT I'M SAYING HERE IS THIS JUST BORROWING MONEY A BUILDING HOUSING THAT'S NOT ENOUGH YOU HAVE TO SUBSIDIZE THE HOUSING TO KEEP TO DOUBLE THE COSTS DOWN. THE COST HAS TO GO DOWN IT'S TOO HIGH RIGHT NOW EVEN THE ON CAMPUS HOUSING IS WAY TOO HIGH SO. THE QUESTION IS. WHAT CAN BE DONE TO BUILD? AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR STUDENTS. WHAT WITH THE STUDENTS THANK WOULD BE AN AFFORDABLE LEVEL FOR HOUSING? IS THERE -- YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT. ARE LITERALLY. BORROWING MONEY TO PAY YOU FOR THE STUDENT HOUSING -- BUILDING. THERE'S SOME WRONG WITHOUT SAY WHY NOT? WHY NOT HAVE US FUN? THE SERVICE IS SUBSIDIZED HOUSING TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS. AND BUILD THE STUDENT HOUSING AND THEN -- LOWER THE COSTS THE SOON SO DON'T HAVE TO BORROW THE MONEY. TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR LIVING EXPENSES. SO SO IT WE NEED SOME MAGIC THOUGHTS HERE I MEAN -- ALL WORK WITH I'M I'M I'M SO HAPPY THAT CENTER GLAZIERS -- INTERESTED IN THIS HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. I WILL MAYBE SOME OF THE OTHERS COULD COMMENT. IF I IF I MAY YOUR MIND IS INTRODUCING YOURSELF PLEASE REALLY FIVE SEVEN ONE ASSISTANT VICE CHANCELLOR FOR CAPITAL PLANNING DESIGNING INSTRUCTION FOR THE ISSUE. SO WE W WE'RE JUST ON THE FRONT END OF OF LOOKING AT AT THIS ISSUE NOT ONLY DOES THIS IS YOU HAVE A BASIC NEEDS INITIATIVE. BUT WE HAVE APPROACHED THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL TRYING TO LOOK AT GRANT FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO THE CHALLENGE WAS OUR STUDENTS IT WAS GETTING TECHNICAL AS FAR AS CATEGORIES HERS ATION BUT OUR STUDENTS DIDN'T QUALIFY BECAUSE THEY ARE TRANSIENT. BUT WE DID TRY TO LOOK AT GRANT PROGRAMS THAT ARE OUT THERE WE COULD. REALLY GET DOLLARS FOR CAPITAL COSTS. OTHERWISE WE HAVE TO PAY FOR THE DEBT TO BUILD THE STUDENT HOUSING RIGHT SO EVEN IF WE BUILD NEW STUDENT HOUSING FOR STUDENTS AND HAD USE OUR EXISTING HOUSING. FOR THE HOMELESS THERE'S STILL THE OPERATIONAL COST AND WHETHER THERE ARE FUNDS THAT COULD HELP THE THOSE STUDENTS WITH. NOT JUST THE CAPITAL COST BUT THE OPERATING COSTS TO BE IN THE DORMSFOR MEAL PLANS FOR EXAMPLE. SO IT IS A COMPLEX ISSUE WE DID MEET WITH THE FORMER CITY MANAGERS OF IRVINE TRYING TO TALK WITH THEM ABOUT HOW CAN SEE THIS YOU PARTNER WITH CITIES TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. THE REALLY STILL ON THE FRONT END BUT APPRECIATE THE COMMON IN AND RECOGNIZE THE HIGH COST OF LIVING. CERTAINLY THE BAY AREA BUT IN SAN JOSE -- JUST SAY THIS -- RUN SO SAM CISCO POSSIBLY. HOUSING PROBLEMS FOR THE STUDENTS OF IMMENSE YOU KNOW THESE KOSTER SO. BERKELEY ALL THE YOU CAN GO ON AND ON UCLA -- THE COST IS SO IMMENSE THAT WE HAVE. TO WE HAVE TO HAVE THE MONTHLY PAYMENT THAT STUDENTS MAY A LOT LOWER. AND THE TRADITIONAL COLLEGE HOUSING FINANCING. SYSTEM DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE. IT ONLY WORKS FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE THAT. HIGH INCOME OR CAL GRANTS THERE IS LIKE A CAL GRANT MONEY IS GOING TO THIS. SO IF WE CAN LOWER THE COST OF THE STUDENT HOUSING MORE. MONEY WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR STUDENTS TO GET CALCRAFT FOR EXAMPLE SO. SO IT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IN A BIGGER [inaudible] PITCHER -- AND IT REQUIRES SUBSIDY GRANTS MONEY TO DRAW DOWN THE COST OF THE FINANCING. OF LEVERAGING FEDERAL DOLLARS -- THE USUAL WAY WE WORK WITH. BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE UNIVERSITY'S HASSOUN BRACE THAT. TO LOWER THE COST YOU CAN YOU KNOW I LIKE I KNOW ONE HOUSING. BECAUSE WE SPOKE ABOUT IT IN OUR COMMITTEE THE HOUSING COMMITTEE SOME REQUIRE NINE SO THAT WE HEARD YESTERDAY AT A HOURS LONG DISCUSSION MORE LOCAL SO. IF YOU PUT UP ONE DOLLAR YOU GET THREE DOLLARS IN FEDERAL TAX THREE DOLLARS OF THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT SYSTEM. SO IS THE BOND POSSIBLY COULD BE LEVERAGING THE SOME KIND OF FEDERAL. MIX OF FUNDS. TO FACILITATE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THAT WOULD LOWER THE COST. FOR THE STUDENTS SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO OUT AND BORROW SO MUCH MONEY. IN A WAIT WAIT WE JUST THE BORROWING IS A SHAMEFUL THING IN MY OPINION I MEAN IT'S LIKE. IS A DISGRACE THAT WE HAVE OUR STUDENTS BARRING SO MUCH MONEY. I CENTER A CHOIR IF I COULD MAKE AS A RESPONSE BECAUSE I SENATOR BILL I I I THINK YOU WERE RAISING AT AN IMPORTANT WEAKNESS -- THAT. CROSSES A LOT OF DIFFERENT SUBJECT AREAS IN REGARD TO OUR UNIVERSITIES -- AND THAT IS THAT THERE'S A PERCEPTION THAT THEY'RE OUT THERE -- ISLANDS. AND THAT THEY'RE NOT ADD THERE'S NO INTEGRATION IN OUR BROADER COMMUNITY ON THINGS LIKE HUNGER -- THINGS LIKE -- MENTAL ILLNESS THINGS LIKE HOUSING AND THAT WE HAVE KIND OF TRY TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS. IN SILOS WHERE THE CAMPUSES ARE EVEN IN THE EQUATION YOU AND I HAVE BOTH WORKED ON A NUMBER OF FORCIBLE HOUSING MINES IN OUR STATE AND I CAN REMEMBER IN MY EXPERIENCE. WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT STUDENT HOUSING? AS A PART OF THAT THE SUBSIDIES THAT ARE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO MAKE IT. WORK -- FOR PEOPLE OF OF LOW MEANS INCLUDING STUDENTS AND THAT'S THAT'S AN OMISSION. THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS HOW WE INCORPORATE. THE CAMPUS COMMUNITY WITH ALL THEIR NEEDS INTO THE BROADER COMMUNITY BCAUSE YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT. THAT THIS ISSUE OF AFFORDABILITY AND HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE ACROSS THE BOARD IT'S ALL OVER THE STATE IN EVERY EVERY PART OF THE STATE. AND STUDENTS CERTAINLY EXPERIENCE THAT -- IN AN EGG TO A GREAT EXTENT AS WELL SO. I THINK YOU'VE GRAZED IMPORTANT SENSITIVITY I DON'T KNOW IF. THERE IS A WAY TO INCORPORATED IN THIS FINE I'D LIKE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SEGMENTS TO TALK ABOUT THAT. AND YOU HAVE ENERGIZE ME TO TALK ABOUT WITH YOU AND OTHERS ABOUT HOW WE INCORPORATE THE STUDENT COMMUNITY AND SOME OF OUR BROADER. SOCIAL WELFARE EFFORTS INCLUDING SUBSIDIES -- IN THE AREA OF HOUSING AND I APPRECIATE YOU RAISING IT. TOO MUCH OF OUR MAY I RESPOND QUICKLY PLEASE. OKAY MY NAME IS DOUG STIMSON EXACTED DIRECTOR OF CAP LOSSES STRATEGIES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OFFICE THE PRESIDENT. AND THE YOU SEE HAS TAKEN STRONG EFFORTS AND AND AND WE'RE OPEN TO DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO APPROACH THIS ISSUE IT IS A BIG ISSUE FOR US. EVERY REGENTS MEETING WE ARE BRINGING HOUSING PROJECTS WE JUST APPROVED THE REGION JUST APPROVED OVER THREE THOUSAND BEDS AT SANTA CRUZ. AND THE DISCUSSION IS HOW CAN WE MAKE THESE MORE AFFORDABLE AND SOME OF THEM ARE GOING TO GO OUT OF 50% OF MARKET. SO WE ON AND ON EVERY SINGLE PROJECT AND WE HAVE APPROVED OVER TWELVE THOUSAND BEDS OVER THE PAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS AND WE HAVE ANOTHER TWENTY THOUSAND THAT ARE IN THE PIPELINE AND SO% ONE OF THOSE. WAYS WERE RESPONDING IS REALLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO LEVERAGE OUR LAND. AND BRING IN A HOUSING THAT IS LESS THAN MARKET AND AS AFFORDABLE AS WE CAN MAKE IT. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIMPSON. A GOOD WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE VICE CHAIR. THIS FEATURE -- I AM A BENEFICIARY OF THE C. ISSUES SYSTEM. I'M A GRADUATE FROM LONG BEACH STATE AND ACTUALLY A PROUD ALUMNI OF THE YEAR BACK IN. TWENTY FOURTEEN COLLEGE OF BUSINESS YEAH. WE PICKED OUT OF SOME TWO HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND GRADUATES OF KIND OF A BIG DEAL -- BUT WHAT THIS DISCUSSION IS MEETING MISSING. IS OPPOSITION THE SENATOR GLAZER I'M HERE TO PROVIDE THAT FOR THIS MORNING IF I IF I COULD -- THIS WILL BE PAID OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND I'M ASSUMING ON A BILLION DOLLAR BOND IS GOING TO COST IN EXCESS OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR AND PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST. AND SO I AM CONCERNED ABOUT WHERE THAT COMES FROM WHAT THAT PUSHES OUT -- OR WHAT HOW DO WE RAISE REVENUES RIGHT NOW -- BECAUSE I AM AN ACCOUNTING PICTURE I DO READ THE COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORTS NOT ONLY FOR CALIFORNIA BUT FOR THE REST OF THE STATES. AND CALIFORNIA IS NOT IN GOOD SHAPE COMPARED TO OUR CONTEMPORARIES -- WE HAVE THE LARGEST UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT IN THE NATION -- IF WE DIVIDED BY POPULATION -- FORTUNY WERE ONLY IN FORTY SECOND PLACE BUT WE WERE IN FORTY SIX PLACE WHEN I FIRST CAME UP HERE SORT WE'RE IMPROVING A LITTLE BIT. OF BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE A MUCH STRONGER BALANCE SHEET BEFORE WE GO OUT. THE ISSUE MORE DEBT I I JUST% DON'T SEE HOW A FAMILY THAT'S STRUGGLING WITH. BUY A NEW CAR THAT IS WELL BEYOND THEIR MEANS -- AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUT THE CAR PAYMENT IN THE MIX. I I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. GET ON THE STRATEGY FINANCIALLY THAT'S SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'RE REQUIRING HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS TO DO. AND THAT IS WE SET ASIDE A LITTLE BIT EVERY MONTH. EVERY YEAR AND BUILD OUR RESERVES AND THEN PAY FOR CASH YOU WOULD PAY. A WHOLE LOT LESS YOU SAVE 50% IF WE PAID CASH AND AND WERE DISCIPLINED. IN THAT REGARD ANOTHER CONCERN I HAVE IS THAT. FOR THE LAST SIXTY YEARS AN INVERTED YIELD CURVE HAS BEEN A PRETTY ACCURATE PREDICTOR OF AN ONCOMING RECESSION. AND WE ARE NOW IN THAT TERRITORY AGAIN WHERE WE HAVE. AN INVERTED YIELD CURVE WHERE THE SHORT END OF THE CURVE IS AT THE SAME HEIGHT AS THE FOUR THREE FOUR TEN YEAR BONDS. SO WE'RE GETTING A GOOD SIGN. AND JUST YOU KNOW IN THE END OF THE INFORMATION WE'VE BEEN GIVEN IN OUR PACKET. WE DON'T FARE WELL COMPARED TO OTHER STATES WHEN IT COMES TO OUR RATING. A CALIFORNIA IS NEAR THE BOTTOM OUR OUR DEBT TO PERSONAL INCOME IS THREE POINT 9% WHICH IS. WELL OVER THE TWO POINT 3% NATIONAL AVERAGE. OUR DEBT PER CAPITA IS ALMOST TWENTY TWO HUNDRED WHICH IS DOUBLE THE AVERAGE MORE THAN DOUBLE. IN OUR DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF ST ST GDP IS ALSO ONE OF THE HIGHEST. YOU'LL SEE WERE NEAR THE BOTTOM OF NEW YORK IN ILLINOIS. AND ONE OF MY OVERALL THRUSTER GOALS CENTER GLAZER IT IS IT WHILE I'M HERE I WANT TO I DON'T WANT TO BE ILLINOIS. I WANNA MAKE SURE CALIFORNIA. STRENGTHENS -- BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE DATA FOR ILLINOIS IT'S IT'S MISERABLE. AND I THINK WE HAVE THEM AS AN EXAMPLE SO I I AM IN IN THAT POSITION WHERE I WOULD LIKE TO BE CAREFUL. ON ISSUING DEBT AND TELL WE'RE IN A LITTLE BETTER FINANCIAL. POSITION AS NOTHING. TO SAY ABOUT THE MERITS OR THE NECESSITY OR THE REST THAT GOES WITH THIS. PROPOSAL I'M. ON THAT. THE CUP IS HALF FULL SIDE OF THE EQUATION SAYING LET'S BE A LITTLE CAUTIOUS BECAUSE IF WE DO. GO INTO A RECESSION -- AND WE WE'VE GOT FIGURE OUT HOW IT ALL WORKS AND AND THAT SO THAT'S WHERE I'M AT NOW IT'S WHILE BE OPPOSED. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SO MUCH THRESHER CIRCULATION WHICH LIKE TO RESPOND. I CAN DO IT IN MY CLOTHES IF YOU WISH AS YOU AS YOU AS YOU. HAVE A WONDERFUL OKAY I WOULD SAY FIRST TO SENATOR MORE LKE I I AS YOU KNOW APPRECIATE YOUR FISCAL STEWARDSHIP I SHARE MANY OF THE GOALS THAT YOU HAVE ABOUT -- UP A PROPER BALANCE SHEET AND BY BUT I WOULD SAY THIS THAT -- WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THESE BONDS WERE DECIDING THAT THEIR PRIORITIES? THE PRIORITIES THAT DATE YES THEY HAVE FIRST TAKE ON THE GENERAL FIND OUT BECAUSE THEY ARE IMPORTANT. AND THE REASON THAT THESE TYPES OF BONDS ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT -- IS BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS INSURE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY MATCHES THE EXPANSION THIS ISN'T ABOUT TRYING TO BUY THE CADILLAC IT'S ABOUT. MAKING SURE THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE GOING TO OUR UNIVERSITY SYSTEM -- ARE DOING SO IN A PLACE THAT'S SAFE THAT HAS SEISMIC SAFETY BUILT INTO THEM WHICH IS NOT THE CASE IN MANY OF OUR BUILDINGS. THAT HAS SAFE PLUMBING AND ELECTRICAL ROOST THAT DON'T LEAK SO THEY DON'T CREATE MILDEW AND UNHEALTHY CIRCUMSTANCE -- SO I WOULD SAY THAT IN YOUR EXAMPLE THIS IS THE TYPE OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO INVEST IN EVEN IN RAINY DAYS. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THAT -- WE CAN UTILIZE OUR OUR FACILITIES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT AND THAT WE CAN DO SO IN A HEALTHY HEALTHY WAY FOR OUR STUDENTS. AND SO I APPRECIATE -- WHY THIS IS GOING TO CREATE AN ADDITIONAL BURDEN ON THE GENERAL FUND I'D SAY YES BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT? BECAUSE IT'S A HIGH PRIORITY AND THAT'S WHYI THINK THIS MEASURE DESERVE TO GO FORWARD I WANTED IN MY CLOTHES JUST THANK THE UCLA STUDENTS. FOR GETTING UP EARLY GO BRUINS MY DAUGHTERS ARE BROUGHT IN AND THEY'D BE VERY PROUD OF THE REPRESENTATION HERE TODAY. AND TAKE THE STUDENT ASSOCIATION FROM UC AND FROM CSU AS WELL AS THE SYSTEM LEADERSHIP -- THE FACULTY AND STAFF ARE TRYING TO WORK TOGETHER TO PUT THIS PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU I I APPRECIATE SENSITIVITY ABOUT IT. IN REGARD TO HOUSING -- I WILL LOOK INTO THAT FURTHER AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION TODAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND A GREATER I THINK WE'RE GONNA ONE MORE AND THEN I'M GONNA MAKE SOME QUICK CLOSING COMMENTS AND WE DID YOU WANNA MAKE COMMENTS. YES PLEASE -- NO I I JUST WANT -- TO I I SUPPORTED THIS BILL I CAN THE THE CAPITAL NEEDS OF THE UC SYSTEM OR ON ENDING AND BECAUSE WE'VE NEGLECTED THE SYSTEM FOR SO LONG SO. FOR SUPPORT OF THE BOND -- I ON HOUSING I'M NOT US SAYING WHETHER IT SHOULD GO INTO THE BOND THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE OTHER. SERVICES AS WELL AND I KNOW THAT WE'RE ALL IN AGREEMENT OF THE DIRE NEED FOR MORE -- STUDENT HOUSING -- THE THE AND AS THE CEREBELLUM MENTIONED THE THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS UCC ISSUE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS AS IT IS IT'S A IT'S A MORAL FAILURE. ON THE PART OF OUR STATE IT'S BEYOND. ARE UNACCEPTABLE AND WE YOU KNOW WHAT WHEN WE DO THINGS LIKE MAKE COMMUNITY COLLEGE TUITION FREE WHICH I SUPPORT -- IT'S GREAT EXCEPT IT DOESN'T GET TO THE HEART OF THE PROBLEM THAT. FOR EXAMPLE COMMUNITY COLLEGE TUITION PALES IN COMPARISON THE COST OF HOUSING -- AND AND WE'RE IN AND WE'RE NOT HELPING THE STUDENTS -- WITHOUT -- FUNDAMENTAL. HUMAN NEED -- SO RIGHT NOW -- WE WE DESPERATELY NEED MORE STUDENT HOUSING. A LOT MORE OF IT -- I BOWL NO -- APROPOS HEARING WE HELD YESTERDAY THAT IN ALMOST 80% OF CALIFORNIA IT'S ILLEGAL TO BUILD STUDENT HOUSING. BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO BUILD MULTI UNIT TO THE LOCAL ZONING SO THESE ISSUES IN APPLIED WITH EACH OTHER. FORTUNATELY YOU SEE LIKE CS YOU -- IT IS NOT BOUND BY LOCAL ZONING -- ON LOCAL LAND USE RESTRICTIONS AND I HOPE THAT YOU SEE -- ALTHOUGH YOU'VE COURSE ALWAYS WANT TO BE A GOOD NEIGHBOR AND WORK WITH -- YOUR NEIGHBORS -- I HOPE THAT YOU SEE WILL BE BOLD AND NOT ALLOWING LOCAL THEN BE OPPOSITION -- TO SAY WELL YOU CAN HAVE STUDENT HOUSING BUT IT CAN'T BE MORE THAN THREE STORIES TALL ARE YOU WE DON'T WANT MORE THAN FIFTEEN UNITS THERE -- BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE HERE -- AND I JUST HOPE THAT YOU SEE WILL BE STRONG AND SAYING THAT THE THAT THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT -- AND EXERCISE YOUR OWN ZONING AND LAND USE -- THOR EDDIE -- YOU KNOW THE I THINK THE STUDENTS SOMEONE ELSE'S THANKING COMMANDER UC STUDENT ASSOCIATION THE STUDENTS IN GENERAL. FOR REALLY FIGHTINGON HOUSING -- I IF I HAVE MY INFORMATION IS CORRECT I BELIEVE THE UCLA STUDENTS -- BROKE AWAY FROM THE WESTWOOD NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION -- BECAUSE THEY WERE SICK OF IN INDIA AS ON THAT WAS HURTING STUDENTS BECAUSE I NEIGHBOR DECISION WAS OPPOSING ALL SORTS OF HOUSING. AND SO THE UCLA STUDENTS YOU KNOW. THANK GOD THEY DID THAT SORRY I AM AND ALL OF THEIR STRENGTH BROKE AWAY -- AND GOOD FOR THEM FOR DOING THAT. AND SO -- WILL WE NEED ALL CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE STUDENTS AND TO NOT LET THEM -- GET DRAGGED. INTO THE THIS FUNCTIONALITY OF CALIFORNIA HOUSING POLICY AND AND REALLY MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN FOCUS ON LEARNING -- NOT ABOUT WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO SLEEP TONIGHT. THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR WINNER I JUST SOME QUICK CLOSING COMMENTS AND WILL OFFER US IN A GLACIER -- A THE CLOSING PART DA SO -- IT'S ALL GOOD LOOK AT BOTTOM LINE IS THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS. I THINK WE HAVE TWO OPTIONS IN THE STATE WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO PAY CASH. TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE FIX IS THAT WE NEED WHEN IT COMES A DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ON OUR CAMPUSES I CAN SPEAK CLOSELY TO THE ISSUES A CEASE YOU NOT NECESSARY YOU SEE JUST BECAUSE OF HUMBLE STAY IN CINEMA STATE. YOU TAKE A LOOK ESPECIALLY HUMBLE STATE THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE -- IT IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE. SO. WE KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO PAY AS WE GO. WE'VE BEEN ATTEMPTING TO DO THAT WITHIN OUR GENERAL FUND. IT IS SIMPLY IS NOT ENOUGH BECAUSE WE HAVE IGNORED DEFERRED MAINTENANCE JUST LIKE OUR ROADS AND BRIDGES AND HIGHWAYS -- IGNORING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WHEN IT COMES TO OUR PUBLIC FACILITIES. I WHICH IS WHY THIS BOND IS SO IMPORTANT. I HEAR THE VICE CHAIR IS AND I AGREE THAT THERE IS A CONCERN FOR ABOUT EVERY BILLION WE PUT ON IT SIXTY MILLION ANNUALLY IN REGARDS. TO PAIN DOWN THAT. A BILLION BOND DEBT SIXTY MILLION A YEAR AND FOR THE GENERAL FUND. AND THERE IS NO OTHER CHOICE. WE CAN EITHER. DEBATE IT [inaudible] DISCUSS IT. OR DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. AND I THINK THAT'S WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY DUE TO MOVE THIS FORWARD. LASTLY IT WOULD ACT WITH A TALK ABOUT HOUSING AND I CAN'T ANSWER SPEAK ON THE U. C. ISSUE BUT JUST ON THE ISSUE -- I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED PARTICULARLY WITH HUMBLED STATE. THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS STUDENTS IN FACT IT HAS THE HIHEST NUMBERS IF NOT THE HIGHEST NUMBERS OF HOMELESS STUDENTS NEED TIRES HIS YOU SYSTEM -- AND THERE IS A CRISIS IN EACH OF OUR CAMPUSES THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS STUDENTS WHETHER IT IS LIVING IN THEIR CAR COUCH SURFING. ACTUALLY OUT IN THE STREET. AN INABILITY TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD. ON CAMPUS OR EVEN OFF CAMPUS HOUSING. I DO THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE. A LONG TERM SPECIFIC PLAN BY BOTH THE U. SIS WAS A CC SYSTEM ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON HAS INNER CAMPUSES -- AND IT MAY MEAN ALSO A SIMILAR TYPE OF INITIATIVE HAS BEEN PROPOSED BY THE GOOD SENATOR FROM AROUND HERE TODAY AND HOW WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO BUILD ADDITIONAL UNITS. THERE ARE SOME CAMPUSES THAT WE'VE SEEN -- IT'S NO MISTAKE. THAT ARE SO DESPERATE THEY'RE GOING OUT TO PURCHASE -- APARTMENT COMPLEXES IN PETALUMA TO BE ABLE TO ATTRACT STAFF TO BE ABLE TO TEACH. WE'RE AT A CRISIS POINT I DO BELIEVE ACROSS THE STATE AND ITS IMPACT ABOUT THIS ISSUE IN THE UC SYSTEM AS WELL. WHETHER IT'S ATTRACTING RETAINING STAFF WITHIN SPECIFIC JURISDICTIONS AND OR BEING ABLE TO HOUSE STUDENTS I THINK THAT WOULD WE'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO HEAR IS WHAT IS THAT NEXT STEP WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING IN BEING ABLE TO FIND HOUSING. LIKE WERE ALSO ABLE -- TO FIND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ON A TURNOVER SMILE IF THERE'S ANY COMMENTS ON THAT -- I'M WITH YA MAINTENANCE WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GO AFTER IT -- IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THAT AND THEN ALSO -- IN REGARDS TO HOUSING CECE'S -- WELL THE ONE COM COME AND I WOULD MAKE IT I THINK THE THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE OF THIS BILL WAS REALLY FOR THE ACADEMIC BUILT BUILDINGS AND IT'S FOR CLASSROOM SPACE. OBVIOUSLY HOME THE HOUSING ISSUE IS A BIG ISSUE IN THIS FIVE SAN JUAN IT SAID. WE ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT -- THAT THAT MIGHT TAKE A DIFFERENT EFFORT -- I DO THINK THAT THE THE CHALLENGE OF PLEASE PUSH BACK ON ME. IF YOU THINK I'M INCORRECT IN THIS. THE WAY WE ARE TRYING TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE IT. WE JUST CAN'T THAT THE THE FUNDS ARE NOT THERE WHETHER IT IS WITHIN THE SPECIFIC UNIVERSE THAT THE CAMPUS ITSELF OR WITHIN THE SYSTEM. TO BE ABLE TO BUILD THE NECESSARY HOUSING THERE TO MEET DEMAND [inaudible] AND THAT'S THE CHALLENGE I THINK WE HAPPEN THAT'S WHY I THINK WE NEED A VERY SPECIFIC PLAN WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING. UP FOR BOTH THIS ISSUE SYSTEM IN THE UC SYSTEM ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PAY FOR IT. BECAUSE I I UNDERSTAND THAT TRYING TO LOSE. YOUR INPUT NOT TRYING TO PUT WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH BUT TRYING TO BE A FOCUS IN ON IT NO THAT IS AN ISSUE. BUT REALLY THE ONLY WAY THAT'S GOING TO SOLVE THIS IS. MONEY IN THE SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO BUILD WOULD THAT BE -- RACK YEAH WE WE NEED THE FUNDS IN ORDER TO BUILD AND MAKE IT AFFORDABLE. I THINK THE OPERATING FUNDS ARE OPERATING FUNDS AS WELL OR EVEN IF WE BUILT IT. HAZARD PAY FOR THEM TO EAT. UTILITIES FOR FOR THAT FACILITY. SO LOOKING AT OF GRANTS AND SUBSIDIES ELSEWHERE AN ONGOING BASIS IS THE CHALLENGE IS ANOTHER PART OF THE CHALLENGE. AND THEN I I THINK -- YOU ALSO ARE. SUFFERING FROM I I I TRACKED IN pBECAUSE OF HOUSING AS WELL -- IN WERE SEEN SOME INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE BEING ADVANCED RIGHT BUT IT'S COMMON SIXTY HUNDRED UNITS AT A TIME -- IN THERE'S A BIT OF A WAVE YOUR COMMENT ON THAT AT ALL. WELL WHAT IS SO FOR CINEMA FORTUNATELY THE CAMPUS WAS ABLE TO PURCHASE A HOME AT LUMINA YEAH. PROPERTY OF BUT BUT IT'S A CHALLENGE ESPECIALLY WHERE THERE BEEN FIRES IN AREAS YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT A LOT OF HOUSING FOR FACULTY AND STAFF AND AND STUDENTS THAT CAN AFFORD IT IN IN ADDITION TO THE HOMELESS SO IT IS A CHALLENGE IN CERTAIN AREAS AND IN SAN FRANCISCO. IS SUCH A HIGH COST AREA IT'S HARD TO FIGURE OUT AND COME UP WITH A MASTER PLAN. BUT I THINK IT IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS FIND OUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO WORK WITH OUR CITIES. AND UNDERSTAND THE ROAD MAP FOR YOU KNOW HERE THEIR FUNDING IS AN IS OUR ABILITY TO WORK TOGETHER ON SOME PROJECT. AND I THINK AGAIN -- NOT TRYING TO DICTATE WHERE YOU ALL THINK NEED TO GO BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A SPECIFIC PLAN ON HOUSING. WITH A MAJOR FOCUS ON STUDENTS. ALSO ON FACULTY WITH BOTH SYSTEMS AND WHAT THAT'S GONNA TAKE FINANCIALLY THAT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE A DECISION THEY WERE AT THE MOVE FOR WITH A SIMILAR INITIATIVE. TO WHAT'S IN YOUR LASERS ARE PROPOSING HERE TODAY. THANK YOU NOT VERY GRATEFUL -- THAT WILL TURN OVER TO SEND IT THANK YOU SO MUCH BY THE WAY I DID MORE TALKING AND HE DID SO -- WILL TURN OVER CENTER GLAZER FOR A A CLOSING COMMENT -- DID TO CHAIR -- ACQUIRE THANK YOU FOR THAT AND THE COMMITTEE FOR TAKING THE TIME TO HEAR THIS MEASURE -- IT'S CERTAINLY THIS PADDLE PROBABLY HAS GREATER EXPERTISE IN LEADERSHIP IN THE AREA OF HOUSING THAN ANY COMMITTEE IN THE SENATE -- AND I THINK THAT THE THE THAT YOU'VE STIMULATED IS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WE INTEGRATE -- THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS IN REGARD TO HOUSING IT WITHOUT THE THE BROADER STATE CONVERSATION THAT'S GOING ON IN THE HEARINGS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE AND I WOULD WELCOME. THE INCLUSION OF THAT SPECIFIC SUBJECT IN THE IN FUTURE CONVERSATIONS IN HEARINGS THAT SHOULD BE IT SHOULD GO FORWARD -- BIGGER THAN THE INSTITUTION BUT I THINK THE INSTITUTIONS CAN COME AND TALK ABOUT IT AND GET GET THAT FEEDBACK AND AND SHARE AND AND FIGURE OUT WAYS TO MOVE FORWARD -- AND DOESN'T MEAN THAT THIS CAN'T HAPPEN WITHIN WHAT'S BEFORE YOU BUT WHAT I THINK WILL BRING IT BACK AND I'LL HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. BUT IN CLOSING LET ME JUST SAY THAT. THIS IS A MEASURE THAT ONLY PUTS IT ON THE BALLOT FOR THE VOTERS TO DECIDE. WE CAN'T MAKE THAT DECISION TO BORROW HERE SO THAT THEY'LL BE A ROBUST CONVERSATION. ABOUT DEATH AND COSTS -- AS WELL AS NEEDED -- GOING FORWARD IF THIS MEASURE -- IS PLACED ON THE BALLOT BUT FOR TOO LONG WE'VE ALLOWED CLASSROOMS LIBRARIES RESEARCH LABS IN OUR CAMPUS THE FALLEN DISREPAIR. THERE'S A BIG CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IS A LONG TERM COSTS. OF BOTH AND AT FUTURE ADDITIONAL COSTS AND AND IN TERMS OF STUDENT SUCCESS. THIS BOND WILL PROVIDE A MUCH NEEDED INVESTMENT IN OUR HIGHER EDUCATION INFRASTRUCTURE I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT TODAY ENGLISH THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK ON THIS AGAIN A STARTED -- I'LL INTO AS I STARTED IT YOU BEEN INCREDIBLY PASSION ABOUT THIS -- IN YOU ARE PUTTING YOUR EFFORT WHERE YOUR WORDS HAVE BEEN I AM VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS WHEN I SAY THANK YOU TO THE TEAM FROM THE C.

THEN WINNER -- WHAT WE GONNA SING HERE TODAY -- SOME DONNA SUMMERS -- HEY THERE YOU GO I LIKE BUT I DID HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY SO I GUESS. IT'S OVER. THAT'S RIGHT ABSOLUTELY WELL SENATOR BEER WE WELCOME YOU -- TO TO COMMITTEE ON SP TWENTY SIX FOCUSING IN ON WORKING FAMILIES ESPECIALLY ON CHILD CARE AND THAT TAX CREDIT. AS IN A CAREER THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOR TEN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- I'M HAPPY TO PRESENT IS B. TWENTY SIX WHICH WOULD MAKE THE CALIFORNIA CHILD AND DEPENDENT CARE EXPENSES CREDIT REFUNDABLE SO THAT LOW AND MODERATE INCOME WORKING FAMILIES COULD BENEFIT FROM THE CREDIT. TO ASSIST WITH THEIR CHILD CARE EXPENSES. THIS IS A WORKING FAMILY TAX CREDIT. TO QUALIFY THE TAX FILER MAY SHOW THE INCURRED CHILDCARE EXPENSES IN ORDER TO WORK. THE CREDIT ALLOWS TAXPAYERS WITH ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME BELOW A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO REDUCE THEIR TAX LIABILITY BY A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR ELIGIBLE CHILD CARE EXPENSES. IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE STATE MADE THE CREDIT NON REFUNDABLE DUE TO BUDGET SHORTFALLS. WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT FAMILIES WITH INCOMES BELOW FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS RECEIVE NO BENEFIT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE A TAX LIABILITY? WHEN THE CREDIT WAS REFUNDABLE THE POOREST FAMILIES BENEFITED ASSISTING THEM TO MEET THEIR BASIC SIX EXPENSES LIKE FOOD HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION? WE KNOW THAT THE COST OF CHILD CARE IS EXPENSIVE AND AN INCREASING BURDEN ON CALIFORNIA'S WORKING FAMILIES. LACK OF ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE IS A HUGE PROBLEM AND WE NEED MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS AND THIS IS JUST ONE OF THEM. RESTORING THE CHILD AND DEPENDENT CARE CARE TAX CREDIT TO BENEFIT EVERY FAMILY THAT QUALIFIES WILL BRING EQUITY TO OUR CURRENT TAX SYSTEM SO BASICALLY IF YOU MADE BETWEEN FIFTY AND A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. YOU'RE GOING TO GET MONEY BACK BUT IF YOU'RE UNDER FIFTY YOU DON'T WHICH IS REALLY INVERSE OF WHAT WHAT WE PROBABLY SHOULD DO. MAKING THE TAX CREDIT REFUNDABLE AGAIN WE'LL PUT MONEY BACK IN THE POCKETS OF FAMILIES THAT NEED IT THE MOST. THOSE EARNING UNDER FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR EYE BUT TODAY IN HERE WITH ME IN SUPPORT IS KELLY GRASS SUCH WITH THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCE AND REFERRAL NETWORK. THINK OF THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL AND AT YOU AS TO THE RIGHT WHEN THE MOST IMPORTANT SO WE CAN DO FOR WOMEN WERE IN FAMILY SO. THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR EFFORT. WELCOME THE COMMITTEE THE FORESHORES MA'AM YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES. THANK YOU. EMPTORIS MCGUIRE NUMBERS AT THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY MOVE THE MICROPHONE UP A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MYSELF BUT MAYBE THANK YOU -- FOR LET ME BUY IT WITH WITH YOU TODAY. SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY THE CALIFORNIA CHILDCARE RESOURCE AND REFERRAL NETWORK HAS SUPPORTED OUR MEMBER RESOURCE ME FOR ALL AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND WHILE WE PLAY A LEADING ROLE IN HELPING CREATE AN AWARENESS ABOUT CHILDCARE ISSUES. ALSO LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL ISSUES ARISE. WELL OUR PURPOSE FORTY YEARS AGO WAS TO CONNECT FAMILIES TO CHILDCARE THAT MEETS THEIR NEEDS TODAY AMONG MANY OTHER THINGS ARE IN OURS ADVOCATE FOR THE ABILITY OF FAMILIES TO ACCESS THE COST OF CARE. WHERE THEY NEEDED WHEN THEY NEED IT AND WITHOUT THE BARRIER OF COST? YET A MAJOR BARRIER TO USING LICENSED CHILDCARE IS THE COST ACCORING TO OUR RECENT RELEASE RELEASE CALIFORNIA CHILDCARE PORTFOLIO THE AVERAGE COST OF A CHILDCARE CENTER. IS RANGING BETWEEN ELEVEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND A CHILD CARE CENTER. THE AVERAGE COST OF FAMILY CHILDCARE IS RANGING BETWEEN SEVEN THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED ON AVERAGE CHILDCARE CAN TAKE UP TO ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE FAMILY'S INCOME THAT'S OUR MONTHLY BUDGET. LOWER INCOME FAMILIES FACE A MUCH HEAVIER BURDEN PAYING FOR CHILDCARE. YET CHILDCARE IS ONLY ABLE CALIFORNIA IS ONLY ABLE TO PAY IN ABOUT ONE IN NINE ELIGIBLE CHILDREN FOR CHILDCARE SUBSIDIES. A FAMILY WHOSE INCOME ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDY BUT DOES NOT RECEIVE ONE THEY COULD END UP PAYING OVER 40% OF THEIR INCOME THAT THEY'RE EARNING. THOSE SAME FAMILIES ARE LIKELY TO QUALIFY FOR RE FRIEND FROM THE CHILD AND DEPENDENT CARE EXPENSES CREDIT SHOULD AS B. TWENTY SIX BECOME A LOT. THIS BILL WOULD MAKE UP A SIGNIFICANT LOST GROUND BY REINSTATING THE RENT REFUND ABILITY OF THE CALIFORNIA CREDIT. WE KNOW THAT THIS BILL WILL HAVE A REAL IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA FAMILY STRUGGLING TO PAY FOR THEIR CHILD CARE EXPENSES AND THE TAX YEAR TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT WHEN IT WAS STILL REFUNDABLE. IT PROVIDED OVER A MILLION DOLLARS IN REFUNDS TO CALIFORNIA FAMILIES AND WHILE THAT MAY NOT SEEM LIKE A HUGE AMOUNT THOSE LITTLE BIT. HELP TO MAKE UP THAT FAMILIES ABILITY TO PAY FOR THINGS SO WHILE THIS TAX CREDIT MAY NOT PAY FOR YOU KNOW WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT THEY'RE PAYING OUT IN THE YEAR. THAT TAX CREDIT WHEN IT DOES COME IN HELP SET FAMILY TO FREE UP OTHER EXPENSES WHEN WE TALK TO FAMILIES ABOUT AFFORDING CHILDCARE WE HELP THEM TO THINK ABOUT THEIR FOOD COST THEIR UTILITY COSTS FOR TRANSPORTATION COSTS. AND A REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT COULD BE JUST WHAT THEY NEED AT THE RIGHT TIME SO THAT THEY CAN KEEP THEIR HEADS ABOVE WATER. WELL -- ONCE -- SB TWENTY SIX WILL SUPPORT WORKING FAMILIES TO CONTINUE TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR HOUSEHOLDS WHILE ALLOWING THEM TO KEEP THEIR CHILDREN. IN THE CHILD CARE SETTING THAT THEY KNOW AND THAT THEY LOVE BECAUSE IF THEY'RE NOT KEEPING THEIR HEADS ABOVE WATER THEY MAY BE MAKING ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS. FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA TODAY HAVE TO MAKE CHOICES SO THAT THEY CAN GET TO WORK SO THAT THEY CAN KEEP A ROOF ABOVE THEIR HEADS. SO THEY PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE FOR THEIR CHILDREN. ABOUT ONE MINUTE. SO WE URGE YOU TO STAY ON THIS BILL THANK YOU SO MUCH NICE JOB IN WE TRULY APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK ON THIS. FOR A GROUP OF YOUR EFFORT IN WORKING WITH THE SENATOR THANK YOU. WOULD LIKE ME TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME FORWARD THIS TIME. YOU DON'T MIND SEEING YOUR FIRST AND LAST NAME ALONG WITH YOUR ORGANIZATION THOSE IN SUPPORT. NOW LIKE BETTER TRANSITION TO THOSE WHO MAY BE OPPOSED IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME FORWARD. LAST CALL FOR A POST IS BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE TO BE TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE AT THIS TIME. HEARING TEEN NINE IS IT THERE'S A MOTION ON THE FLOOR THIS THE DEW PASTOR PREPARATIONS WE'RE GONNA HAVE CENTER COPIER -- MAKE A CLOSE RESPECTED RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NEIGHBORS.
