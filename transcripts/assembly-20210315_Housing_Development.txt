OTHER ITEMS- I THINK WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR. THE GOOD SENATOR TORONTO TO JOIN US I WILL PRESENT MY BILL. RIGHT THIS FILE ITEM NUMBER ONE AB THREE TWENTY EIGHT WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK YOU ADA OPEN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- TO OUR COMMITTEE COLLEAGUES FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF AB THREE TWENTY EIGHT THIS IS A BILL TO ADDRESS WHAT HAS BEEN AN ONGOING CYCLE OF INCARCERATION AND HOMELESSNESS OR PUT ANOTHER WAY AN ONGOING CYCLE FROM CELL BLOCKS TO SIDEWALKS AND BACK. WE KNOW THAT SOLVING A HOMELESSNESS CRISIS WILL REQUIRE ADDRESSING THE PLIGHT OF FOLKS AS THEY LEAVE THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THE FACT IS. ABOUT 50% OF ALL INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS HAVE REPORTED A HISTORY OF INCARCERATION. WHEN PEOPLE LEAVE OUR PRISONS THEY NEED A STABLE HOME AND YET CDCR IS ESTIMATED THAT AT LEAST 20% OF FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS. BECOME HOMELESS UPON RELEASE AT THIS MOMENT THERE ARE NO STATE FUNDS TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE TO BECOME STABLY HOUSED. FORMERLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE ARE TWENTY SEVEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE HOUSING AND SECURITY. WE KNOW. THAT ACCESS TO LONG TERM HOUSING AND LEVEL WAGES ARE KEYS TO REDUCING HOMELESSNESS AND RECIDIVISM. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE HOMELESS ARE SEVEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO RECIDIVIST THAN SOMEONE WHO IS STABLY HOUSED. WOULD COVER NINETEEN IMPACT IN OUR MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS LIVING ON OUR STREETS. THE NEEDS FOR A PROGRAM TO HELP REDUCE THE NUMBER OF DISCHARGES INTO HOMELESSNESS IS ABSOLUTELY. CRITICAL IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS OUR STATE PRISON POPULATION WILL DECLINE TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN THREE DECADES THIS IS GOING TO RESULT IN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. BEEN RELEASED FROM PRISONS AND COULD RESULT IN OVER A BILLION DOLLARS IN COST SAVINGS FOR CDCR. THIS BILL WOULD ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BY DOING TWO THINGS IT WOULD REDIRECT A PORTION OF CD R. C. SAVINGS. CDCR SAVINGS TO PROVIDE HOUSING WITH SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TO FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING OR AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS. AND IT WOULD SAVE THE STATE AND TAXPAYERS TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FUNDING- FUNDING TO AVOID THE CYCLE OF INCARCERATION AND HOMELESSNESS- IN CLOSE WE KNOW THAT SHEPHERDING PEOPLE FROM CELL BLOCK THE SIDEWALKS. FAILS TO RECOGNIZE BOTH THE KEY DRIVER OF OUR HOMELESS EPIDEMIC IN OUR DUTY AS A STATE AND WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT. I TIME UNDERSTAND THEIR TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT- THAT BEING HE NEVER SOLACE FROM THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND ALSO RICHARD MIRRORLESS. CAN YOU GET THEM ON THE LINE. I'M ON HERE.

EVERYONE SAID THAT I MAY AS WELL NOT EVEN FILL OUT AN APPLICATION BECAUSE I WOULD MOST CERTAINLY BE DENIED. HAD THE CHAIRMAN OF THE CROP ORGANIZATION NOT COSIGN FOR AN APARTMENT. I WOULD HAVE BEEN LIVING OUT OF MY CAR. I HAD MY GRANDFATHER NOT COSIGN FOR MY CAR. I WOULD HAVE BEEN HOME. I CAN SPEAK THE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF ALL THOSE THAT I WAS IN TRANSITIONAL HOUSING WITH. ONLY ONE HAS STABLE HOUSING TODAY THE REST SUBSEQUENTLY BECAME HOMELESS. AFTER THEIR TRANSITIONAL HOUSING TERM ENDED AND NOW STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTION. I CAN'T IMAGINE THRIVING PERSONALLY OR PROFESSIONALLY WITHOUT STABLE HOUSING. THE FIVE FORMERLY INCARCERATED DIRECTORS AT THE CROP ORGANIZATION ARE HELPING OTHERS NAVIGATE THIS ISSUE WITH THE GOAL OF PROVIDING SHORT AND LONG TERM HOUSING SOLUTIONS FOR RETURNING COMMUNITY MEMBERS. MANY ARE CRAWLING WITH THE BEST OF INTENTIONS BUT THE BARRIERS TO HOUSING AND THE SUBSEQUENT. INCREASED RISK OF HOMELESSNESS EXACT EXACERBATED LACK OF EMPLOYMENT WHICH ULTIMATELY RESULTS IN CALIFORNIA'S PROBLEMS WITH RECIDIVISM. INSTEAD OF INCREASES IN HOMELESSNESS WE BELIEVE THE PUBLIC WOULD PREFER LEGITIMATE HOUSING SOLUTIONS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO PASSED AWAY FORMERLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE TO MEANINGFUL EMPLOYMENT AND SELF SUFFICIENCY. BECAUSE OF THIS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AB THREE TWENTY EIGHT AND URGE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. CAN WE CONNECT THE WITNESS NUMBER TWO MISTER SOLACE.

GREAT THEN AT THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE THAT AND I'D LIKETO BRING IT BACK- TO QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS GOVERNESSES BRICK SILVA ASSEMBLY. THANK YOU. IS THIS ON. YEAH THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR BRINGING AB THREE TWENTY EIGHT FORWARD THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT I FULLY SUPPORT I IF WE LOOK AT. THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED AND COMING OUT AND AS YOU SAID FROM CELLS TO SIDEWALK- THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING. WE CERTAINLY HAD AN ISSUE BEFORE COVERED WE HAVE EVEN MORE OF AN ISSUE FOR ALL OF OUR VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE FACING HOMELESSNESS. BUT IF YOU IMAGINE SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN INCARCERATED AND THE DEBT THAT IS STACKED AGAINST THEM THEY CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES GETTING OUT. AFTER THEY HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME. AND ALL TOO OFTEN WE SEE THE PATTERN REPEAT AND REPEAT AND REPEAT. ONE OF THE PROJECTS THAT IS OUT THERE THAT IS HIGHLY ACCLAIMED. IS A PROJECT CALLED PROJECT REBOUND IN THIS IS HOSTED AT CAL STATE FULLERTON. AND OTHER CSU'S BUT IT'S SIMPLY A FORMERLY INCARCERATED PERSON WHO IS INTERESTED IN GOING TO COLLEGE OR ALREADY HAS SOME COLLEGE EXPERIENCE. CAN MOVE INTO FULLER TEN IRWIN HOUSE AND SO IF YOU GET OUT OF. PRISON OR BEEN INCARCERATED YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REAP FOR HOUSING. ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE'S HOPE AND FOR THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING AT THIS HOME. MANY OF MANY OF THEM ARE GRADUATING NOT ONLY WITH THE FOUR YEAR DEGREE BUT WITH MASTERS AND IN TURN GOING BACK TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S WHAT HOUSING CAN DO. NOT ONLY FOR FORMERLY INCARCERATED BUT FOR ANYONE TO HAVE A PLACE TO LAY YOUR HEAD A PLACE TO CALL HOME. SO I NOT ONLY SUPPORT THIS BUT BELIEVE THIS REALLY IS THE KEY. BUT IT'S ALSO THE KEY FOR TAXPAYERS WE ALL TO OFTEN ARE GOING TO PAY SOME WAY OR ANOTHER WE'RE PAYING WHILE THEY'RE IN PRISON WE PAY WHEN THEY GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOMS AND WE PAY A LOT IN MANY WAYS WHEN MANY TIMES THEY RETURN TO BEHAVIORS THAT CAN ASSAULTER COMMUNITIES. SO I'M ABOUT LOOKING TOWARDS OPTIMISM AND HOPE AND LOOKING AT WAYS THAT WE CAN REIMAGINE. FOR THOSE WHO HAVE ASCENDED HOW CAN THEY COME BACK INTO OUR COMMUNITIES AND BECOME THE RESPONSIBLE ADULTS THAT WE WANT THEM TO BE. I FULLY SUPPORT AB THREE TWENTY EIGHT AND MOVE THIS BILL. ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA. SECOND IF IT WASN'T SECOND ON THAT- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK OUR CHAIR CHIU OF FOR BRING THIS BILL FOR A PROUD JOY AUTHOR AND I THINK- MY COLLEAGUES TO SPOKE VERY WELL AS TO WHY THIS BILL IS NECESSARY I REALLY LIKE THE FACT THAT THERE ARE A VARIETY OF TOOLS AVAILABLE IN TERMS OF INCENTIVIZING- OF LANDLORDS IN AND NUMBER TWO. BE INVOLVED THE PROGRAMS WAS NOT JUST A MATTER OF THE RESOURCES BUT WE ALSO WANT TO WANT TO BE A PARTNERSHIP- AND THE RECOGNITION THAT ULTIMATELY- OVER THE YEARS AS WE CORRECTLY- COMMITTEE TAKEN REALLY SERIOUS STEPS IN TERMS OF THE CAR SERRATION RECOGNIZING. THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO- REALLY TURN. BACK THE TIDE OVER MANY YEARS. OF HEFTY SENTENCING AT A GREAT COST YOU IN COSTS AS WELL AS FISCAL COSTS. THAT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH WE ALSO HAVE TO PUT OUR INVESTMENT IN A THOUGHTFULNESS INTO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEONE GETS RELEASED AND- WELL THAT'S WHAT I WAS VERY. HAPPY TO- JOINED UP WITH THIS BILL AND REALLY GREAT FOR THE AUTHOR OUR CHAIR- FOR ESTABLISHING THIS PROGRAM THAT I THINK AND REALLY DO HOPE- WILL BECOME A MODEL. FOR HOW YOU REALLY DEAL WITH THE- GLOBAL ISSUES THAT SOMEONE HAS WHEN THEY GET RELEASED TO MAKE SURE FIRST AND FOREMOST. THAT THEY HAVE A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD- BECAUSE ALL THE OTHER ISSUES CAN BE RESOLVED IF THEY DON'T HAVE. A STABLE PLACE TO LIVE AND WE'VE CERTAINLY SEEN THAT- DURING THE COVERAGE CRISIS AS FOLKS HAVE BEEN RELEASED THAT. THEIR ISSUES DON'T END WITH THEM GETTING RELEASED FROM THE STATE OF INCARCERATION IN MANY WAYS- THEIR ISSUES ARE JUST BEGINNING OF THE END AND THE DOMINO EFFECT. ALL STARS WITH HOUSING SO OF A VERY HAPPY. SUPPORT AGAIN WANT TO THANK ARCHER. ANYONE ELSE. L. CLOSE AND SO THIS IS A THIS ISSUE WITH REESE RECIDIVISM IS REALLY M. S. IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND IT ISN'T ALWAYS JUST ABOUT THE HOUSING THAT'S WHAT ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS THE BILL AS THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY BEING PUT INTO THE HOUSING COMPONENT WHEN THERE ARE TWO EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT OTHER COMPONENTS AND THAT'S ADDICTION AND JOB TRAINING AND AS MR MERRILEES HAD SAID SO ELOQUENTLY ON IT WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING TO WITNESS- EIGHTY HE HAD. A LOT OF THE TOOLS YOU NEED TO GET A JOB BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE THAT TYPE LINE TO GET THE JOB BECAUSE THAT JOB IS WHAT ULTIMATELY PAYS FOR THEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND NOT ONLY GETTING HOUSING BY KEEPING HOUSING AND WHILE I THINK THIS HOUSING ELEMENT OF IT IS VERY IMPORTANT IT'S ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IT SEEMS TO BE BEING JUST SPENT TOWARDS THE HOUSING BUT NOT TOWARDS THE ADDICTION PROGRAMS AND THE JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS WHETHER THAT BE TECHNICAL EDUCATION OR DEGREE PROGRAMS. AND THOSE PROGRAMS ARE ARE UNDER SERVED IN OUR PRISONS AS AS I HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE ABOUT WHY WHY ARE WE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN THAT WHY ARE WE NOT EDUCATING MORE PEOPLE WHY ARE WE NOT GETTING THEM READY TO COME OUTSIDE AND BE SUCCESSFUL SO THAT THAT'S MY CONCERN IS THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE NINE AGENCIES THAT DO FORTY ONE PROGRAMS. TO HELP HOMELESSNESS- OUR HELP WITH THE HOMELESS PROBLEM AND WE'RE JUST NOT SUCCESSFUL AND WE SPEND. THREE BILLION DOLLARS AND WE'RE GOING TO SPEND MORE. BUT SOMEHOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO CONSOLIDATE THESE. INTO SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS AND HAVE THEM BE MORE COORDINATED- SO THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF MY CONCERNS WITH IT- THAT TO ADD AT THIS TIME- WE HAVE A MOTION BY COURT MISTER MARK SILVA. IN A SECOND BY MISTER KALRA. SO THE SECRETARY WANNA CALL THE ROLL OUR DID YOU WANT TO CLOSE I'M SORRY I'D LOVE TO CLIENTS AND- VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS- PRETTY GOOD FOR COLLEAGUES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL I WANT TO SAY TO THE VICE CHAIR. I'M NOT SURE IF THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT THIS MONEY WOULD BE USED FOR BUT- THIS MONEY WOULD VERY MUCH GO TO A SUPPORT OF HOUSING MODEL. THAT ADDRESSES JOB TRAINING THAT ADDRESSES SUBSTANCE ABUSE IN FACT IN THE BILL IT SPECIFICALLY SAYS THAT SERVICES MUST BE PROVIDED TO PARTICIPANTS IN OUR HOME. THAT INCLUDE- AND I'LL JUST STAY HERE LINKAGES TO EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES. AS WELL AS LINKAGES TO- MEDICAL FUNDED MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT AND MEDICAL TREATMENT WE KNOW. THAT THE BEST WAY TO GET THESE FOLKS UP ON THEIR FEET. AND GET THEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL IS TO PUT A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS BUT ALSO PROVIDE THEM ACCESS. TO THE VERY SERVICES THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT. PUTTING A ROOF OVER SOMEONE'S HEAD WERE PARKING ABOUT FULLY INTEGRATING- THE SERVICES AND WE KNOW IF WE DO THAT. YOU KNOW AT THE MOMENT- CDCR SPENDING CLOSE TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO INCARCERATE SOMEONE IN A PRISON CELL. IF WE PUSH THEM OUT ONTO THE STREETS THAT COSTS OUR TAXPAYERS ABOUT THIRTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. IF WE PUT. FOLKS IN AN ENVIRONMENT WITH SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. COUPLED WITH THE SERVICES THAT WE JUST TALKED ABOUT. IT'S ONLY GONNA COST US ABOUT AN AVERAGE OF TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR AND I WOULD ALSO SAY GIVEN THAT. HALF OF ALL FOLKS ON OUR STREETS HAVE AN EXPERIENCE. WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IF WE ARE ABLE TO HOUSES INDIVIDUALS. WITH A CHANCE AT- CUTTING. THAT NUMBER POTENTIALLY IN HALF SO THAT'S- REALLY THE VISION OF THIS BILL. HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN FURTHER CONVERSATIONS IF THERE'S A WAY TO- TO MAKE IT EVEN CLEARER FOR YOU WHAT THIS IS ABOUT BUT- WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED YES I DID READ THROUGH THE BILL AND- AND THOSE THINGS ARE CLEAR TO ME I JUST. I'M LOOKING AT PROGRAMS THAT HAPPENED BEFORE THE FACT BEFORE THEY GET OUT AND HAVING THOSE PROGRAMS TO BE SUCCESSFUL SO THAT WHEN THEY GET OUT- THEY ARE READY FOR THAT PART OF IT AND THAT. THAT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PART IS CRITICAL BUT THERE'S ALSO A POINT- ARE A PART OF THIS. WHERE THERE. WELL THEY'RE NOT- REQUIRED THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE SOBRIETY AND TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THIS HOUSING AND THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO MAKE YOU KNOW DID TO BE DRUG FREE AND THOSE ARE THE TRAPS TO PEOPLE ARE FALLING INTO BECAUSE THEY GO FROM DON'T GO JUST GO FROM PRISON TO THE STREET THEY GO FROM STREET. TO PRESENT AN INTERACTIVE STREET AGAIN AND THEN BACK TO PRISON AND THAT'S THE END AND ALL OF THOSE ARE THE UNKNOWN DAY IF THE ADDICTION PART OF THAT IS A HUGE PART OF THAT AND SO THAT'S MY CONCERN AND I UNDERSTAND. AND IF THIS WERE- IF NOT ALL OF THE MONEY WAS BEING- RESERVED FOR THE HOUSING PART BUT HAS HAD MORE DIVERSE TO SUPPORTING PROGRAMS WHILE THEY'RE INCARCERATED. THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE GONNA BREAK THEIR ADDICTION AND THAT'S WHAT MY CONCERN IS MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE SPENDING SOME MONEY ON THAT PART OF IT. SO I APPRECIATE THE BILL IT'S IN A YEAH I REALLY DO- TODAY I JUST HAVE THOSE CONCERNS. THANK YOU ON GOING CONVERSATION AND THIS TIME ABOUT MISS SECRETARY CAN CALL THE ROLL. EIGHTY EIGHT. GOOD PASSAGE. THE COMEDIAN APPROPRIATIONS TWO FIVE TWO FIVE THEY ARE DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW GABRIEL GABRIEL I KALRA RIGHT FOLLOW I HIGHLY. HIGHLY NO MAIENSCHEIN CLARK SILVA OKAY SILVA I WICKS FIVE WEEKS. FIVE FIVE TWO THANK YOU HAVE MENTIONED OF PASSES TO THE ASSEMBLY FIVE TWO. COOL. YEAH. MISTER MISTER KELLY KELLY THE CHANGE ON THE HOUSE RULES AT HIGHS NOT BUT- WITH THAT ARE WE HAVE ONE FINAL BILL FOR TODAY I THINK IT IS FILE ITEM. FOR FROM NOT MISTAKEN. PHYLUM SIX SB FIFTY ONE SENATOR THEY'RE ALSO. OKAY PLEASE OKAY WHEN YOU'RE READY TO PROCEED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- GOOD TO SEE YOU UP MEMBERS- OF THE COMMITTEE I'M HERE TO PRESENT SB FIFTY ONE. WHICH WILL PROVIDE MEANINGFUL COST SAVINGS FOR THE STATE IT WILLPRODUCE A MODEL TO EXPAND AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND IS GOING TO ENHANCE OF HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY AND THIS BILL ALIGNS WITH GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S EXECUTIVE ACTIONS TO FOSTER HOUSING INNOVATION ON. EXCESS STATE LAND FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DISPLACED FAMILIES WHO LIVED IN WHAT IS CALLED THE SEVEN TEN CORRIDOR IN ORDER TO BUILD A FREEWAY THROUGH THE COMMUNITIES OF EL SERENO IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. AND THE CITIES OF PASADENA AND SOUTH PASADENA. IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY OUR LEGISLATURE DECLARED NO FREEWAY WOULD BE BUILT. WE INTRODUCED SB FIFTY WANT TO IMPLEMENT A FAIR PROCESS FOR TENANTS TO BUY THEIR HOMES. AND BRING MORE LONG TERM AFFORDABLE HOUSING INTO EL SERENO. MANY PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN SITTING VACANT AND IN DISREPAIR FOR YEARS IN THE MIDST OF THE WORST HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. THE BILL WOULD GIVE CURRENT TENANTS THE FIRST RIGHT TO PURCHASE THEIR HOME AND IF THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED OR NOT ABLE TO BUY THE HOME IT REQUIRES THAT A PRO A PUBLIC OR PRIVATE HOUSING RELATED ENTITY. WHO PURCHASES THE PROPERTY PROVIDED FOR LOW AND INCOME LOW AND MODERATE INCOME. RENTAL OR OWNERSHIP HOUSING FOR AT LEAST FIFTY FIVE YEARS GIVING THE FIRST RIGHT OF OCCUPANCY TO THE PRESENT OCCUPANTS THESE HOUSING RELATED ENTITIES COULD BE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR NONPROFIT HOUSING ENTITIES. SB FIFTY ONE ALLOWS THESE ENTITIES TO BY THE PROPERTIES AT THE ORIGINAL PRICE. IN EXCHANGE FOR REMODELING PRESERVING AFFORDABILITY AND MAINTAINING THEM. VACANT PROPERTIES ALSO WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY FOR HOUSING RELATED ENTITY TO CONVERT TO LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSING UNDER THE FIFTY FIVE YEAR AFFORDABLE RENTAL COVENANT. THE CURRENT LAW IS FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON HOMEOWNERSHIP AND IS NOW OVER THIRTY YEARS OLD IT SETS THE ORDER OF SALES BUT DOES NOT CREATE LONG TERM AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOUSING. CURRENT LAW WAS WRITTEN TO FACILITATE HOUSING TO EXISTING GOOD STANDING TENANTS IF THE VACANT PROPERTIES WERE TO GO THROUGH THE EXISTING PROCESS THEY WOULD BE AUCTIONED OFF AND ULTIMATELY OPENED UP TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER. THAT'S A RECIPE FOR GENTRIFICATION AND DISPLACEMENT THIS BILL WAS DEVELOPED AFTER HUNDREDS OF HOURS OF CONVERSATIONS AND MEETINGS WITH RESIDENTS ADVOCATES TENANTS OF CALTRANS PROPERTIES CALTRANS OFFICIALS LA CITY AND COUNTY OFFICIALS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. SB FIFTY ONE PROVIDES A PATHWAY TO HOMEOWNERSHIP AND EXPANSION OF AFFORDABLE RENTALS. THE RECENT AMENDMENTS TO THE SURPLUS LAND ACT IN THIS BILL PROVIDE THE BENEFIT OF ENHANCING DESPERATELY NEEDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS IN OUR STATE- I SEE. MY COLLEAGUE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER WENDY CARILLO WHO IS THE PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR AND- TO ADD TO THIS PRESENTATION I'D LIKE TO RECOGNIZE OUR COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLYMEMBER CARILLO AND- NOT SINCE WE DON'T HAVE TO SEE TO THE WITNESS TABLE IF EITHER SOME SAY THAT SHE COULD TESTIFY EITHER. FROM THE BACK. PERFECT UNLESS YOU WANNA DO YOU WANNA COME UP TO YOU WANNA COME TO THE REST. COME ON UP. GOOD TECH TEAM HERE. NUMBER THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS IT'S ALWAYS A GREAT WAY TO HAVE A GREAT WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR STATE SENATOR TO BE ABLE TO WORK ON ISSUES THAT ARE IMPACTFUL AND IMPORTANT TO OUR COMMUNITY AND I WANT TO THANK CENTER THE DOCILE FOR LEADING ON SB FIFTY ONE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR DOING THIS HEARING TO HEAR SB FIFTY ONE TODAY FOR YEARS. AFTER A FEW YEARS NOW CENTER THAT ALSO AND I HAVE ENGAGE WITH RESIDENTS RENTING APARTMENTS AND HOMES FROM CALTRANS IN OUR COMMUNITY WE HAVE URGE FAIR TREATMENT OF THESE TENANTS AND THE EXPEDITED SALE OF THESE PROPERTIES AT AFFORDABLE HOUSING RATES SEVENTY YEARS AGO THROUGH EMINENT DOMAIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BEGAN DISPLACING FAMILIES. AND ALTERING THE COMMUNITY OF EL SERENO FOR A FREEWAY EXPANSION CALTRANS BROUGHT PROPERTIES WITHOUT REGARD FOR THE FAMILIES IN THE CORRIDOR DISRUPTING THE ECONOMIC SOCIAL AND CULTURAL FABRIC OF THIS PREDOMINATELY LATINO COMMUNITY AS THE FUTURE OF THE SEVEN TEN FREEWAY HUSBAND DECIDED EL SERENO HAS BEEN ACUTELY IMPACTED BY NEGLECT TRAFFIC CONGESTION. AND VACANCY WITH NEARLY ONE HUNDRED CURRENTLY VACANT NEARLY HALF THE CALDERON HOMES IN EL SERENO AND MANY IN POOR CONDITION WE HAVE AN URGENT OPPORTUNITY TO REPAIR AND IMPROVE THIS NEIGHBORHOOD. WE WANT TO REPAIR THESE HOMES AND MAKE THEM RESPECTFUL DIGNIFIED LIVING SPACES WHILE EXPANDING LONG TERM AFFORDABILITY THIS BILL HELPS ACHIEVE THAT HOUSING AFFORDABILITY IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR US THIS YEAR IT HAS BEEN FOR MANY YEARS AND EVERY YEAR UNTIL THIS CRISIS HAS ENDED IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE PURSUE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO PRESERVE AND EXPAND AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS. ARE BILL SIX TO MOVE OWNERSHIP AWAY FROM CALTRANS SECURE LONG TERM AFFORDABILITY AND THE NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE UNITS WHILE ENSURING CURRENT CALTRAIN TENANTS ARE PROTECTED BY RULES ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING RESIDENTS RENTING APARTMENTS AND HOMES IN THE SEVENTEEN CORRIDOR DESERVE FAIR TREATMENT AND STABLE HOUSING. SB FIFTY ONE PROVIDE A LONG TERM SOLUTION FOR HEALING FOCUS ON THE PRIMARY GOAL OF EXPANDING AND PRESERVING. AFFORDABILITY FOR ALL THESE PROPERTIES WHILE PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF TENANTS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS BILL THIS IS THE BILL AS VERY. CLOSE TO THE SENATOR NINE IS IT'S IN OUR COMMUNITY IN OUR DISTRICT I WENT TO EL SERENO MIDDLE SCHOOL RIGHT IN THIS COMMUNITY. AND I KNOW VERY WELL WITH WHAT THE CURRENT CONDITIONS OF THESE HOMES ARE BECAUSE I LIVE THERE. I DRIVE AROUND I SEE THEM CALTRANS HAS NOT BEEN. A GOOD LANDLORD FOR MANY YEARS A LOT OF THESE HOMES NEED MASSIVE REPAIR AND WE NEED TO GET THAT WORK DONE NOW. AND ENSURE THAT IT MOVES FORWARD THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN EYEFUL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

OUR MISSION AT THE HOUSING AUTHORITY IS TO CREATE AND PRESERVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WE SEE THIS BILL AS A NECESSITY AND MUCH NEEDED FOR THE EL SERENO AREA WHERE THERE'S A LARGE HOMELESS POPULATION WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE QUICK TRANSITION OF THESE PROPERTY.
