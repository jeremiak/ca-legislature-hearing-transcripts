THINK MORE THE PRESCRIBERS ARE

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:01.232

THAT EIGHTEEN OH NINE AS

00:40:24.021 --> 00:40:25.389
CURRENTLY WRITTEN IT DOESN'T

00:40:25.456 --> 00:40:26.557
JUST LOOK AT AN ANTI X. IT LOOKS

00:40:26.624 --> 00:40:32.463
AT ALL TYPES CYCLE THERAPEUTICS.

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:33.664

CONCERNED FROM NURSING

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:10.935
FACILITIES PERSPECTIVE IS WE

WILL HAVE PATIENTS THAT WILL

00:41:14.672 --> 00:41:17.775
LOSE ACCESS. IT REALLY NEEDED.

00:41:17.842 --> 00:41:20.511

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE BUT

00:41:23.547 --> 00:41:25.783

IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:38.562
WE ARE. WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY

00:41:38.629 --> 00:41:40.965

BILL. BECAUSE THE TESTIMONY

00:42:34.652 --> 00:42:36.153
WE'VE HEARD IN THE BILL ITSELF

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:38.422
CONCENTRATES ON THE OVER USE OF

00:42:38.489 --> 00:42:40.791
ANTI PSYCHOTICS AND I'M NOT

00:42:40.858 --> 00:42:42.927
GOING TO ARGUE WITH THAT. IT'S

00:42:42.993 --> 00:42:45.663
MY CONCERN IS THE MOST COMMON

00:42:45.729 --> 00:42:48.632
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES IN OLDER

00:42:48.699 --> 00:42:51.001
ADULTS AND IN NURSING HOMES. OR

00:42:51.068 --> 00:42:54.872
DEPRESSION. ANXIETY DISORDER AND

00:42:54.939 --> 00:42:57.107
I WILL TELL US A PRESCRIBER I

00:42:57.174 --> 00:42:59.576
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO IT HERE TO

00:42:59.643 --> 00:43:02.313
THE- REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL

00:43:02.379 --> 00:43:04.114
TO BE ABLE TO PRESCRIBE ANTI

00:43:04.181 --> 00:43:05.983
DEPRESSANTS OR ANTI ANXIETY

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:08.519
DRUGS. BECAUSE OF SIDE EFFECTS

00:43:08.585 --> 00:43:13.891
OCCUR. IN VARYING FREQUENCIES N.

00:43:13.958 --> 00:43:16.193
I WOULD NOT KNOW WHAT. WHERE THE

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:19.396
LINE IS IT THINGS THAT HAPPENED

00:43:19.463 --> 00:43:20.998
ONE IN A HUNDRED IT'S A THINGS

00:43:21.065 --> 00:43:23.100
THAT HAPPENED ONE IN A THOUSAND

00:43:23.167 --> 00:43:24.501
IS IT A SIDE EFFECT WHICH WAS

00:43:24.568 --> 00:43:26.670
RARE IS ONE IN A MILLION. AND

00:43:26.737 --> 00:43:28.605
YET THOSE MIGHT BE CONSIDERED

00:43:28.672 --> 00:43:31.742
MATERIAL TO INFORMED CONSENT

00:43:31.809 --> 00:43:34.845
UNDER THIS BILL AND IF I WAS

00:43:34.912 --> 00:43:38.449
WRONG AND LEFT OUT A VERY RARE

00:43:38.515 --> 00:43:40.851
SIDE EFFECT. I WOULD BE SUBJECT

00:43:40.918 --> 00:43:42.753
TO CRIMINAL PENALTIES SEN IT

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:44.788
WOULD. CLEARLY BE A

00:43:44.855 --> 00:43:47.424
DISCOURAGEMENT. AND WE ALREADY

00:43:47.491 --> 00:43:50.060
KNOW THAT THE PROVISION OF THESE

00:43:50.127 --> 00:43:51.762
KIND OF MENTAL HEALTH DRUGS FOR

00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:54.598
NURSING HOME RESIDENTS. IS LOWER

00:43:54.665 --> 00:43:56.367
THAN THE NEED IN OTHER WORDS.

00:43:56.433 --> 00:43:57.801
THERE'S AN OVER USE OF ANTI

00:43:57.868 --> 00:44:00.237
PSYCHOTICS THERE'S AN UNDER USE

00:44:00.304 --> 00:44:02.639
OF ANTIDEPRESSANTS AND

00:44:02.706 --> 00:44:04.041
TREATMENTS FOR GENERALIZED

00:44:04.108 --> 00:44:07.244
ANXIETY DISORDER. AND I THINK

00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:11.715
THAT- REALLY EVERY EFFORT TO

00:44:11.782 --> 00:44:15.352
MAKE IT EASIER FOR PRESCRIBERS

00:44:15.419 --> 00:44:16.587
TO PRESCRIBE FOR THOSE MENTAL

00:44:16.653 --> 00:44:19.189
HEALTH CONDITIONS SHOULD BE

00:44:19.256 --> 00:44:21.892
ENCOURAGED WHERE IS THISBILL

00:44:21.959 --> 00:44:24.261
DOES EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE. THE

00:44:24.328 --> 00:44:26.196
SECOND WAY I'M AFRAID THAT THIS

00:44:26.263 --> 00:44:27.965
BILL WILL HARM PEOPLE IS

00:44:28.032 --> 00:44:31.035
WITHDRAWAL EFFECTS BECAUSE-

00:44:31.101 --> 00:44:32.302
THERE IS A REQUIREMENT UNDER

00:44:32.369 --> 00:44:34.438
THIS BILL TO DO THE CONSENT

00:44:34.505 --> 00:44:37.441
EVERY SIX MONTHS. AND YET AS A

00:44:37.508 --> 00:44:40.077
NURSING HOME DOCTOR IT'S COMMON

00:44:40.144 --> 00:44:41.845
TO SEE STABLE PATIENTS ABOUT

00:44:41.912 --> 00:44:44.448
ONCE A MONTH. AND WHAT I WORRY

00:44:44.515 --> 00:44:46.750
ABOUT IS IF YOU FORGET TO GET

00:44:46.817 --> 00:44:49.186
INFORMED CONSENT ON THE FIFTH

00:44:49.253 --> 00:44:52.956
MONTH. YOU MIGHT EXCEED THE SIX

00:44:53.023 --> 00:44:54.358
MONTHS BEFORE YOU VISIT THEM

00:44:54.425 --> 00:44:55.993
AGAIN AND THE NURSING HOME WOULD

00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:58.529
BE OBLIGED TO STOP THE MEDICINE

00:44:58.595 --> 00:45:00.697
ABRUPTLY. WHERE IS THESE ARE ALL

00:45:00.764 --> 00:45:03.400
MEDICINES THAT WE NORMALLY PAPER

00:45:03.467 --> 00:45:05.669
WHEN WE DISCONTINUED. AND IF YOU

00:45:05.736 --> 00:45:07.805
ABRUPTLY STOP THEM THEY'RE

00:45:07.871 --> 00:45:09.940
REALLY ASSOCIATED WITH SIDE

00:45:10.007 --> 00:45:12.709
EFFECTS AND SO I'M CONCERNED

00:45:12.776 --> 00:45:15.412
THAT THESE COMMON CONDITIONS AND

00:45:15.479 --> 00:45:16.447
I'M SURE YOU DEPRESSION IS

00:45:16.513 --> 00:45:20.884
COMMON. WILL CLOSE FOR THANK YOU

00:45:20.951 --> 00:45:22.486

THIS- FACILITY- SO- HUH I THINK

00:48:19.263 --> 00:48:21.131
IT A BIT LOOKING AT THIS BILL

00:48:21.198 --> 00:48:22.466
OBVIOUSLY UNDERSTAND THE INTENT

00:48:22.532 --> 00:48:24.501
IN THIS IS THE THESE WERE GOING

00:48:24.568 --> 00:48:26.069
THROUGH THE PROCESS YOU'RE GONNA

00:48:26.136 --> 00:48:27.938
BE WORKING A WORKING THROUGH-

00:48:28.005 --> 00:48:32.676
ALL OF IT- I HAVE- ENDED UP-

00:48:32.743 --> 00:48:35.345
MARRYING A PROVIDER DENTISTRY OF

00:48:35.412 --> 00:48:38.081
COURSE NOT- IN. IT'S NOT A

00:48:38.148 --> 00:48:40.284
PHYSICIAN AND DOESN'T WORK IN A-

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:42.419
HEALTH FACILITY. I LEARNED A

00:48:42.486 --> 00:48:44.254
LITTLE BIT ABOUT- CONSENT FORMS

00:48:44.321 --> 00:48:46.023
AND SORT OF THE PROCESS OF ALL

00:48:46.089 --> 00:48:48.859
OF THAT. AND THERE IS A SENSE

00:48:48.925 --> 00:48:50.794
AMONG PROVIDERS WHO HAVE TO MAKE

00:48:50.861 --> 00:48:53.263
DECISIONS. VERY QUICKLY- WHETHER

00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:54.865
YOU'RE MAKING A RIGHT DECISION

00:48:54.931 --> 00:48:58.335
OR- A WRONG DECISION. AND THE

00:48:58.402 --> 00:49:00.437
THOUGHT OF BEING CHARGED WITH A

00:49:00.504 --> 00:49:04.508
CRIMINAL. OFFENSE FOR- FOR THEIR

00:49:04.574 --> 00:49:06.510
PROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR IS PRETTY

00:49:06.576 --> 00:49:09.579
STRONG- AND SO IS THAT SOMETHING

00:49:09.646 --> 00:49:11.415
THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE A

00:49:11.481 --> 00:49:13.417
LOOK AT. A WIDER DID GET IN THE

00:49:13.483 --> 00:49:15.585
BILL IN THE FIT IN THE FIRST

00:49:15.652 --> 00:49:16.720
PLACE IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S

00:49:16.787 --> 00:49:19.489
NECESSARY- IF YOU CAN ADDRESS

00:49:19.556 --> 00:49:20.824
THAT PROVISION I UNDERSTAND IF

00:49:20.891 --> 00:49:22.092
YOU'RE GOING TO. DO SOMETHING

00:49:22.159 --> 00:49:23.493
YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:26.029
ENFORCEMENT MAC ISM BUT- AS A

00:49:26.096 --> 00:49:26.697
SEATS PRETTY STRONG. WILL LOBBY

00:49:26.763 --> 00:49:27.631
THE FIRST DEGREE THAT THE

00:49:27.698 --> 00:49:29.366
BATTERY ISN'T THE CORRECT

00:49:29.433 --> 00:49:30.967
PENALTY THAT WE HAVE IN THE BILL

00:49:31.034 --> 00:49:32.769
AS IT IS NOW. AND WE'RE GOING TO

00:49:32.836 --> 00:49:34.504
CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT DURING

00:49:34.571 --> 00:49:37.407
THE NEXT COMMUNITY WHEN WE GO TO

00:49:37.474 --> 00:49:37.974
THE ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY. AND

00:49:38.041 --> 00:49:39.543
WE'LL FIGURE OUT WHAT OF-

00:49:39.609 --> 00:49:41.845
PENALTIES ARE APPROPRIATE. SO AT

00:49:41.912 --> 00:49:43.480
THAT TIME WE WILL GO WE ARE

00:49:43.547 --> 00:49:45.549

THIS AS WELL- IT AGAIN BUT I

00:49:48.552 --> 00:49:50.721
THINK PART OF IT IS YOU WANT TO

00:49:50.787 --> 00:49:51.688
MAKE SURE THAT THE PROVIDERS

00:49:51.755 --> 00:49:52.756
<u>RE. PROVIDE I MEAN THERE'S BAD</u>

00:49:52.823 --> 00:49:54.391

00:49:54.458 --> 00:49:55.559
HUNDRED YEAH FOR SURE THOSE BAD

00:49:55.625 --> 00:49:56.727
ACTORS- AND SO UNDERSTAND THAT

00:49:56.793 --> 00:49:58.795
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME SORT OF

00:49:58.862 --> 00:50:01.331
MECHANISM FOR THE SAME TIME YOU

00:50:01.398 --> 00:50:01.998
DON'T WANT TO. DETER PROVIDERS-

00:50:02.065 --> 00:50:02.766
YOU KNOW PHYSICIANS FOR MAKING

00:50:02.833 --> 00:50:03.967
DECISIONS BECAUSE IF THEY FEEL

00:50:04.034 --> 00:50:05.902
LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO BE MAKING

00:50:05.969 --> 00:50:06.636
A DECISION. THAT THEY'RE GONNA

00:50:06.703 --> 00:50:07.938
LOSE OUR LICENSES THEY'RE GONNA

00:50:08.004 --> 00:50:10.907
END UP IN A IN IN IN JAIL OR

00:50:10.974 --> 00:50:11.541
WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE THAT IT

00:50:11.608 --> 00:50:13.477
ENDS UP HAVING A CHILLING EFFECT

00:50:13.543 --> 00:50:15.245
ON THE CARE THAT THEY MIGHT NEED

00:50:15.312 --> 00:50:16.947

DON'T NEED AND THAT PROBABLY

00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:45.776
HURT THEM IF THAT'S A PATTERN

00:50:45.842 --> 00:50:46.610

INCOME IS TWO THOUSAND FIVE

01:01:15.538 --> 01:01:17.140
HUNDRED DOLLARS WHICH PUTS THEM

01:01:17.206 --> 01:01:17.974
ABOVE THE 110038% FEDERAL

01:01:18.041 --> 01:01:19.609
POVERTY LEVEL FOR A COUPLE.

01:01:19.675 --> 01:01:21.044

MEDICAL TOGETHER THEY WILL HAVE

01:01:22.578 --> 01:01:24.647
A SHARE OF COST. THE PROBLEM IS

01:01:24.714 --> 01:01:27.617
THEIR SHARE OF COST WOULD BE ONE

01:01:27.683 --> 01:01:28.651
THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY SIX

01:01:28.718 --> 01:01:30.019

ONLY NINE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR

01:01:33.056 --> 01:01:33.956

01:01:34.023 --> 01:01:35.425
LEASE SALE WITHOUT ENOUGH MONEY

01:01:35.491 --> 01:01:36.592

SUCH AS RENT. FOOD OR UTILITIES.

01:01:39.429 --> 01:01:40.863
NOT THE AND HER SIBLINGS ARE

01:01:40.930 --> 01:01:42.398
ALREADY HELPING WITH THE BILLS

01:01:42.465 --> 01:01:43.499
BUT WITH THE SHERIFF COSTS THAT

01:01:43.566 --> 01:01:44.700
HIGH THE FAMILY COULD NOT

01:01:44.767 --> 01:01:46.102
AFFORD. FOR BOTH PARENTS TO

01:01:46.169 --> 01:01:47.403
APPLY FOR MEDICAL. IN ORDER TO

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:49.739
AVOID A HUGE SHARE OF COST THE

01:01:49.806 --> 01:01:51.374
ONLY OPTION FOR NOT THESE

01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:52.041
PARENTS WOULD BE TO PRIORITIZE.

01:01:52.108 --> 01:01:53.876
THE PARENT WITH THE HIGHER NEED.

01:01:53.943 --> 01:01:55.344
AND SUBMIT A MEDICAL APPLICATION

01:01:55.411 --> 01:01:56.312
SEEKING SPOUSAL IMPOVERISHMENT

PROTECTIONS. ALTHOUGH HER MOM

01:01:58.114 --> 01:01:59.482
REQUIRES A LOT OF CARE THE

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:00.817
FAMILY DECIDED TO ONLY HAVE JOSE

01:02:00.883 --> 01:02:03.186
APPLY AS HIS HEALTH WAS

01:02:03.252 --> 01:02:03.920
DECLINING RAPIDLY. THIS IS A

01:02:03.986 --> 01:02:05.788
COMMON PROBLEM THAT I'VE COME

01:02:05.855 --> 01:02:06.556

BETWEEN WHICH PARENT RECEIVES

01:02:09.826 --> 01:02:11.894
CARE. BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD

01:02:11.961 --> 01:02:12.728
THE SHERIFF COST. IF THE

01:02:12.795 --> 01:02:13.830
MAINTENANCE NEED LEVELS INCREASE

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:17.433
TO MATCH THE 110030% FEDERAL

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:18.601
POVERTY LEVEL. POSING A LEASE.

01:02:18.668 --> 01:02:21.003
OF WOULD ONLY BE THREE HUNDRED

01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:22.171
NINETY FOUR DOLLARS. WHICH WOULD

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:23.539
BE A LOT MORE FEASIBLE FOR NOT

01:02:23.606 --> 01:02:25.241

INCREASING THE MAINTENANCE THE

01:02:29.278 --> 01:02:30.480
LEVEL WOULD ALLOW OLDER AND
