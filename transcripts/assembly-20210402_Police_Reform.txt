AND THEN PROCEED. YOU FOR INVITING US TO BE. ARAMBULA IF YOU CAN SPEAK A BLOWOUT I AM BALLOT- AND LOOKING DOES SISTER- CASSANDRA KEEP A CALLING ANGELES SMALL. AND I AM ROBERT COLLINS- I IMAGINE LOW CANDICE'S STEPDAD ALTHOUGH HE CALL ME DAD. YES SO FOR IT JUST A BIT OF BACKGROUND YEAH THAT'S WHAT I CALL IN CUI ANGELO WAS EXPERIENCING AN EPISODE OF EXTREME PARANOIA ON THE NIGHT OF- TALKING TO WHAT DECEMBER TWENTY THIRD. AND HE EXPERIENCED THIS BEFORE- WE WERE NOT. AS PATIENTS PATIENT ON THAT NIGHT AS HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY AND THAT ENDED UP EXACERBATING HIS FEARS- WHICH IN TURN LEAD MY MOTHER NINE TO PANIC FOR OURSELVES. M. AS HE HELD IT TOGETHER AND- BECAUSE MY DAD WAS HE WAS FAR AWAY I DECIDED MY ONLY CHOICE. HAD BEEN TO CALL THE POLICE FOR HELP. WHEN THEY ARRIVED QUICKLY. THE FIRST TWO OFFICERS SMALL. TO SEE ME RESTRAINING IN A BEAR HUG ON THE FLOOR CHEST TO CHEST HE MADE NO MOVE TO ESCAPE FROM. I THINK BEING THIS IS WHAT HE NEEDED. THE OFFICERS PROCEEDED WITH THE CALL WITH EVEN FOR BECAUSE IT LOOKED LIKE I WAS IN CONTROL. HE TOOK FROM MY ARM THE SESSION HERE. AND ON THE WAY DOWN HE SAID TOWARD IF PLEASE DON'T KILL ME. DID THE NONPROFIT. ONE OFFICER ACROSS HIS LEGS AND PUSH THEM TOWARDS HIS BODY. IN THE OTHER OFFICER PUT HIS FEET ON THE BACK OF FEDERAL RULES THAT. THEY HAD SOME DIALOGUE WITH ME DURING WHICH WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE ANGELO DID NOT BELONG IN JAIL. BECAUSE HE WAS HAVING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. BUT THEY DID NOT CHECK A NONCHALANT. I ASK SEVERAL COLLEAGUES. FOR USE QUESTIONS. THE TWILIGHT DECEIVE THEY COULD CHIP. BUT THEY DID NOT. AFTER WHORL THE OFFICER THAT HAD HIS KNEE AND WEIGHT ON ABSOLUTE RETIRED IN THE ANOTHER OFFICER. DO KIDS POLICE ONCE THE PARAMEDICS ARRIVED THE REMOVED THEIR WAIT FOR AVENGERS THE ACT AS THEY TURN THEM OVER HE WAS LIAM LEADING FROM HIS MOUTH ANY TH ICE ROLLED UP IN HIS HEAD HE LOOKED DEAD. THE PROCEEDED TO REMOVE THE HEAD COACH AND WITHOUT PERFORMING CPR PROCEEDED TO PUT HIM ON SOME KIND OF BLANKET OR TARP. AND MOVE HIM TO A GURNEY WHERE THEY BEGIN THE CPR THEY TOOK HIM TO THE HOSPITAL. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CONDUCT OF THE OFFICERS WAS UNNECESSARY FOR TWO MAIN REASONS- FIRST THAT THEY RECOGNIZE AS A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS WHICH REQUIRES DE% ESCALATION AND SPEAKING TO THE PERSON EXPERIENCING IT- AND SECOND HE WAS COMPLIANT NONVIOLENT. AND ABLE TO BE RESTRAINED BY MY MOM- SO SOON WE WERE TAKEN TO THE POLICE STATION. WHERE WE WERE KEPT FOR HOURS BEFORE WE WERE QUESTIONED AT ABOUT FOUR AM WE WERE DRIVEN BACK TO OUR HOUSE BUT WE'RE NOT ALLOWED. INTO THE HOUSE UNTIL AFTER NINE AM. AMONG THE MANY PEOPLE INSIDE THE HOUSE WERE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND DETECTIVES. WORKING TOGETHER IN TEAMS OF TWO ONE ANTIOCH POLICE DETECTIVE AND ONE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY- THEY WERE TAKING TURNS ASKING MY OTHER BROTHER AND MY DAD- WHAT HAD HAPPENED OR JUST QUESTIONS ABOUT MY BROTHER COLANGELO. AND AMONG- EXCUSE ME DURING THIS TIME THEY PREVENTED US FROM SPEAKING TO THE DOCTORS TO LEARN ABOUT THE STATE OF MY BROTHER- AND THAT WENT ON FOR AS LONG AS THEY COULD AMONG THE MIXED ASSURANCES THAT HE WAS OKAY ONE OFFICER SAID HE WAS NOT DEAD YET AT THE STATION AFTER TELLING US WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GET IN CONTACT WITH HIS DOCTORS ANOTHER RUSHED MY MOTHER OFF THE PHONE WHEN THE DOCTOR HAD CONTACTED US- AND ONE MORE OFFICER TOLD US HE'D SEEN MY BROTHER AND HE WAS FINE AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD ALREADY TOLD US. I'M SURPRISED HE'S EVEN ALIVE- WE THINK THAT WE DESERVED ACCESS TO ALL INFORMATION POSSIBLE- ACCESS TO THE DOCTORS AND MEDICAL INFORMATION OUTSIDE OF INVOICES AND WHAT THE OFFICERS ARE ON THE RECORD OF SAYING HAPPENED THAT NIGHT. ANGELES THIRTY YEARS OLD AND HE OFFICIALLY PASSED AWAY ON DECEMBER TWENTY SIX. HOWEVER ACCORDING TO THE DOCTOR HE HAD ALMOST NO BRAIN ACTIVITY AND HAD ONLY A VERY FAINT PART B. THREE FOUR X. HE HAD NO OTHER REFLEXES ARE ATOMIC RESPONSES. HE WAS KEPT MEDICALLY ALIVE BUT BY MAYBE SIXTEEN DIFFERENT DRUGS WHICH KEPT HIS HEART BEATING. BUT HIS ORGANS WERE DYING AND MUCH OF HIS BRAIN WAS DEAD HE WAS LABOR NEVER ABLE TO BRIEF ON THE PHONE. SINCE THE OFFICER HAD KEPT HIM UNDER COULD BEAR WEIGHT HAD NO GAG REFLEX AND HE'S ICE COULD NOT CLOSE HE'S HOW HE'S- ALWAYS HAD TO BE TAPED SHUT. HE DIED AT THE HANDS OF PEOPLE I TRUSTED. DURING A TIME OF WHILE THE BIRD WILL THEIR ABILITY. PEOPLE WE LET INTO OUR HOUSE TO HELP. REFORM MUST INCLUDE A BROADER FOCUS A SWOLLEN CHANGING EMERGENCY RESPONSE ON MENTALLY IMPAIRED INCIDENTS. IT'S VERY PAINFUL PAINFUL IS IT IS TO HAVE LOST MY SON WITNESSING IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO STOP IT KNOWING IT WAS PREVENTABLE IS ANOTHER LEVEL OF PAIN. WITNESSING HOW WE WERE TREATED TO AFTERWARDS WITH NO ACCESS TO ANY INFORMATION AND THE ENERGY OF DECEIT. IT'S ANOTHER LEVEL OF PAIN. WE BELIEVE THE OFFICERS NEED TO BE PENALIZED WHEN THEY DON'T FOLLOW THEIR TRAINING REGARDLESS OF WHATEVER OR NOT. THE DA FLAMES THAT THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED. NO THE ONLY AM ARE YOU JUST. THE BILL OF THIS LOSS EVERY BIG THE- I AM WELL RAGE AT THE WAY. THE APPEAR TO BLAME THE- OF CITY. IT IS FRUITFUL THE- FROM MY WRIST IS REGIS HE DOES UNDER THEIR HELLO MY AGE. THANK YOU. THANK THANK.

WE SEE POLICIES LOCALLY AND I LOCAL GOVERNMENTS STATE GET PUT INTO- THAT YOU KNOW GET PUT INTO. THE BECOME POLICY AND THEY DON'T HAVE ANY REPERCUSSIONS ATTACHED TO THEM SO THEY GET VIOLATED. AND THERE IS NO. YOU KNOW THERE IS NO. THERE IS NO. THERE'S NOTHING THERE THAT THAT MAKE SURE THAT THESE THINGS DON'T GET VIOLATED OR THAT THESE OFFICERS DON'T CONTINUE TO REPEAT. THE SAME THINGS OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO I JUST WANT I WANT TO BRING THOSE THINGS UP BECAUSE- THERE IS A LOT OF- FLOW CHANGE. THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING SINCE STEPHON CLARK'S DEATH I'LL SAY BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN I'VE SEEN THE MOST REACTION FROM. LEGISLATORS AND- ELECTED OFFICIALS AND APPOINTED OFFICIALS AND POLICE CHIEFS AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO- WE ARE STILL EXPERIENCING THESE ABUSES THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS JUST IN THE pSOMETIMES MOST OF THE TIME THEY ARE IN THE FORM OF. ABUSE IN OUR COMMUNITIES- SO I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT AS WELL I KNOW PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN I KNOW A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN HARASSED A NUMBER OF TIMES AND CONTINUE TO BE TARGETED ON A REGULAR BASIS JUST FOR EXISTING IN THEIR COMMUNITY.

WE'D CERTAINLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND FOR YOUR ACTIVISM IN THIS SPACE. NEXT UP IF RANDY WE WILL LIKE TO HEAR FROM OUR THIRD PANELIST DR GE- JANA. OF PRICE SHARKS A LICENSED PSYCHOLOGIST SPECIALIZING IN POLICE OF WILL BE JOINING US VIRTUALLY. DR PRICE SHOPS ARE YOU WITH US. I AM A FIRST RESPONDER PSYCHOLOGIST THEY'VE BEEN TREATING POLICE OFFICERS FOR ABOUT TWENTY ONE YEARS AND- I DO A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS BUFFET THERE'S LIKELY DEBRIEFINGS AND AFTER SHOOTING SITE TREAT A LOT OF PTSD- I ALSO DID PRE EMPLOYMENT EVALUATIONS- I ALSO RUN A NON PROFIT THAT PROVIDES A LOT OF THIRTY CLIENTS POSTED FAMILY. AND AND TO SOMEONE FIRST AND IT'S WELL AND I WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE NATIONAL POLICE DECIDE FOUNDATION AND THAT IS A NONPROFIT AGENCY THAT IS- A RESOURCE. FOR OFFICERS THAT ARE CERTIFIED ALL. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MANY DON'T KNOW AND I'M SURE THE CAN IN IS AWARE THAT. POLICE ARE ARE MORE TO COMMIT SUICIDE THAN THEY ARE TO DIE AND STRICT. WE HAVE REALLY AN EPIDEMIC OF POLICE OFFICERS WHO ARE COMMITTING SUICIDE WHO ARE- IS SUFFERING FROM SEVERE PTSD OFTEN TAKE THEIR LIVES AFTER AFTER THEY'VE RETIRED BECAUSE OF THE STRESS AND TRAUMA OF THE JOB. AND I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT OVER A HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF OFFICERS I'VE WORKED WITH. I BARELY HAVE FLED AND OFFICERS WHO DOESN'T. REALLY LOVE THEIR COMMUNITY BUT UNFORTUNATELY OFFICERS ARE TAX WITH HAVING THE SAME NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT ALL OF THAT TAB AND UNFORTUNATELY SOMETIMES THEY HAVE LESS THAN A HALF A SECOND TO MAKE VERY CRITICAL DECISIONS THEMSELVES. SOMETIMES THOSE DECISIONS ARE GOOD AND SOMETIMES THEY'RE NOT SO GOOD AND AFTERWARDS THEY SPEND THE REST OF THEIR LIVES BEATING THEMSELVES UP. AND IT'S ALWAYS A TRAGEDY ALWAYS A TRAGEDY WHEN SOMEBODY DIES IT'S ALWAYS A TERRIBLE THING AND THEN THE COST TO THE FAMILY OF THE PERSON THAT THEY LIVE IT'S HORRENDOUS BECAUSE TO THAT THE COMMUNITY IS HORRIBLE- BUT ONE STORY THAT WE NEVER HEAR IS THE COST TO THE OFFICER- THAT HAVE TO MAKE THAT JUDGMENT AND- THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I AM PRIVY TO BECAUSE. I STANDS. MANY MANY READING TREATING THESE AND WOMEN IN LAW COURSE IT'S- WITH THE STATE'S. AND HAVE NINE FROM THEM HAVE SEVERE. THERE ARE FOR OUR SAN THEY VERY I FEEL FROM THE COMMUNITY- AND THEY THEY KIND OF ENTER A PERSONAL HELP. THAT THEY THEY REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY PLACE TO TURN TO BECAUSE- UNLIKE OTHER PEOPLE OFFICERS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TALK TO THE MEDIA THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO PUT ANYTHING OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA. AND THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK TO FRIENDS AND RELATIVES YOU DON'T WANT TO BE A BURDEN BECAUSE- FROM DAY ONE IN THE ACADEMY THE TAX FELLOW ADD- TAKING CARE OF ALL OF US. AND DO THEY DO IT PERFECTLY SOMETIMES AND SOMETIMES THEY DON'T AND I AM VERY MUCH AWARE OF THAT. BUT I WILL SAY THAT MOST OF THEM THAT I HAVE MET OVER THE YEARS TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY. BUT OVER THE YEARS THE JOB DOES TEND TO CHIP AWAY AT THEM AND THAT THEIR FAMILIES AND THAT THE WELL BEING OF THEIR FAMILIES. AND. IT'S SO. SHE YOU KNOW IT'S VERY THAN THEN BECAUSE TO THE MELA. WHERE IN ANOTHER LANE- WITH THEY DON'T- WORKING PEOPLE THAT THEY DO YOU KNOW THAT IS THEIR THEIR THERE TO. AND SUDDENLY OUT THERE TASKED WITH. TRYING TO DECIDE THEIR QUEUE FROM A COMMUNITY MEMBER AND THEN OFTEN THEIR THEY'RE ALSO TASKED WITH DEFENDING THEMSELVES AND THEN HAPPY TO RENDER AID- HE P. R. ANY KIND OF DRUG RESUSCITATION METHODS. AND SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT THEY LIVE WITH HER FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. AND IT'S NOT LIKE WHAT IT'S LIKE ONLINE. MOVIE DURING THE MOVIE CARE AND ONLY BUT SQUARE OFFICERS JUST YOU KNOW USE FORCE WHEN THEY. GO HOME AND THEY'RE JUST FINE. I HAD NEVER BEEN THAT TO BE THE CASE AFTER WITH ME MANY MEN AND WOMEN HAVE P. BUT I HAVE. IN THERE. IS IN L. THERE ARE ONLY AND THAT THE THAT MEANT HEALTH WITH THE THEY THEY SHOULD LIKE THAT GET OUT OF.AND SO I. WHAT I WANTED EVERY TO NATALIE SAID IT. IT'S PARTNERSHIP THAT THAT IT VERY DIFFICULT PART. AND THE WHAT SECOND IS ARE VERY TOUGH AND HAVE A VERY LONG LASTING IMPACT ON- ON THE OBJECT DURING THE OFFICER'S FAMILY BUT ALSO OBVIOUSLY ON THE COMMUNITY AND- AND THE PEOPLE THAT LOST PEOPLE DURING THAT. DURING THAT EVENT SO IT'S- AN AREA THAT NEEDS. TO BE LOOKED AT AND YOU KNOW IF THERE ARE SOME SOLUTIONS ARE RESOLUTIONS ARE THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE. BUT IT'S EVERYBODY IS HURTING- WHEN. YOU SUCH COURSE HAVE TO HAPPEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DR PRICE SHARP FOR YOUR TESTIMONY WE ASK THAT YOU JUST STAND BY WE'LL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU- WHEN WE GET DOWN TO OUR- QUESTIONS AND ANSWER PERIOD SO WE CAN ASK YOU TO PLEASE STAND BY- FOR THAT- REALLY APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY.

WELL THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON- FOR THIS INVITATION TO SPEAK TODAY BEFORE. OF THE ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON POLICE REFORM TO DISCUSS THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE ON REFORM. FROM ISSUES OF POLICE AUTHORITY- MY NAME IS AGAIN THE TOP SUPPORT PORTER AND PRESIDENT. OF THE SACRAMENTO CHAPTER OF THE NATIONAL ACTION NETWORK FORMER CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA. STATE NETWORKS NETWORK- WE ARE ONE OF THE LEADING CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS IN THE NATION FOUNDED BY THE REV AL SHARPTON. PROMOTING A MOTHER CIVIL RIGHTS OF GENDER THAT CLOSE TO ONE THE FIGHT FOR ONE STANDARD OF JUSTICE DECENCY AND EQUAL. OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL PEOPLE. UNFORTUNATELY I'VE HAD EXPERIENCE BEING COMMUNITIES WHO UNDERGONE WELL I BELIEVE THE MISUSE THE MISUSE AND THERE ARE SAY ABUSE OF POLICE AUTHORITY. NOT ONLY HERE SACRAMENTO OVER STEPHON CLARK'S. KILLING WELL ALSO MY HOME STATE OF MINNESOTA WHERE WITH THE MURDER OF GEORGE FLIGHT. IN BOTH CASES THE RESULTS ARE THE SAME A FRACTURED RELATIONSHIP. BETWEEN OUR PEACE OFFICERS AND THE COMMUNITIES THEY ARE SWORN TO PROTECT AND SERVE. THEIR LOSS OF TRUST- HOPE AND A LOW MORALE REGARDING POLICING IN THESE COMMUNITIES THERE IS FOR YOUR ASPIRATION TO THE POINT WHERE THE COMMUNITY RESPONSES ALL ALMOST ALWAYS. COMBATIVE TOWARDS AUTHORITY. POLICE MISCONDUCT MISCONDUCT CREATES TRAUMA AND MENTAL ILLNESS. I HAVE WITNESSED EXPERIENCED FIRST HAND. WHICH I BELIEVE IS BEING PLAYED OUT NATIONALLY AFTER WATCHED THE TRIAL DURCH OFTEN FOR THE KILLING OF GEORGE FLOOR. CONDITIONS OF THIS PLEASE MISCONDUCT COST TAXPAYERS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN THE SOLOMON OF CIVIL LAWSUITS AND LEGAL COSTS. THAT COULD BE BETTER SPENT ELSEWHERE. ALL SOCIETIES AFFECTED BECAUSE- BECAUSE OF THEIR SEN OMINOUS PRESENCE ALL COMMUNITIES IT ONE PERSON IS ABUSED THE WHOLE ENTIRE FAMILY FEELS THE PAIN. POLICE ABUSE OF POWER IF THESE DAMAGES TO OUR COMMUNITIES AS WELL WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT ABUSE THEIR POWER IT CREATES ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS FEAR AND MISTRUST MISTRUST DAY INDOORS YEARS AFTER THE INCIDENT OCCURS WHICH FURTHER TO GRACE THE RELATIONS BETWEEN COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. IF SOMEONE IN A BLACK OR BROWN COMMUNITY IS A BIG BOTH CRIME. WE HAVE TO THINK TWICE ABOUT CALLING THE POLICE WE'RE JUST SAYING SINCE WE PAY HARD EARNED TAX MONEY FOR THEIR SERVICE. OUR FIRST THOUGHT IS. CAN WE TRUST THEM. IT RECALL POLICE WILL THEY ESCALATE OR NOT AND YEAH- DE ESCALATE WHEN THEY ARREST ME OR HURT ME OR OR WORSE KILL ME YOU KNOW AND NOT GET THE REAL PERPETRATOR AND THIS TRAIN OF THOUGHT AS BROUGHT ABOUT BY BAD POLICING AND THE OVER USE OF FORCE IN OUR BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES. HI AGAIN HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS FIRST HAND- I LIVE IN OAK GROVE IS TO THE OUTSIDE OF SACRAMENTO. ELEVEN THOUGH PRETTY WELL TO DO NEIGHBORHOOD. AND SOME YEARS AGO THERE WAS AN INCIDENT THAT A RARE INCIDENT OCCURRED RON NEED TO CALL THE POLICE. AND WHEN I CALLED THEM TO REPORT THE CRIME I FELT THE NEED TO TELL THE DISPATCHER TO LET THE POLICE NOW. AS SHE WAS SENDING- THE POLICE THROUGH. I'M A ENABLE. AND THE ONLY THE HOUSE ARE BLACK. AND THAT WE WERE NOT THE SUSPECTS. I WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I WAS NOT GOING TO BE HURT OR ARRESTED. OR NOT MY CHILDREN OR MY WIFE WILL BE PERFORM RESTED. OR BEAT UP OR SOMETHING SIDE WAYS I'M I AM NOT ALONE. THE IMPACT OF MISUSE OF AUTHORITY IS THAT. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE TERMS. YOUR REAL BALLPARK OF OUR LIVES BECAUSE KOHLI BELIEVES MISSILES EVEN MORE FEARFUL. ALL FOUR LINES. AND THAT'S SIMPLY IS NOT HOW WE'RE% SUPPOSED TO LIVE IN A CIVIL SOCIETY. IS NO SIGNAL ALL OF. THAT IS THE- TO BLACK PEOPLE BLACK MEN AND WOMEN ARE STILL PART AS THE BEST. AND BY LARGE TEST AND I'M SORRY IT'S OKAY HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT TREATS US. FOR EXAMPLE IN SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS MURDERED STEPHON CLARK THEY JUST OF BALTIMORE'S OWN. MOTHER KIANA SUICIDE BY COP. AND THE IMPACT OF SUCH RESULTED IN THE WHOLE COMMUNITY TRAUMATIZED FROM THE NIGHT OF TERROR. AND HIS FAMILY FOREVER STRUGGLING TO FIND WAYS TO MAKE ANY SENSE OF IT ALL. AND WE SEE THE SAME DRAMATIC IMPACT DUE TO POLICE MISCONDUCT ACROSS THE COUNTRY REPEATEDLY YORK TO DO THE TRUCK TO THE CHOKING OF ERIC GARNER'S OPEN WITH OSCAR GRANT. IN THE IN THE BAR STATION THIS ALSO HOLDS TRUE TO OVERSEE AND NOW WITH THEIR SHOP AND A MINNEAPOLIS THE MONEY UP THE MINNEAPOLIS POLICE OFFICER WHO HELD HIS NAY ON GEORGE PLACE NEXT BUT WHAT WE NOW KNOW. TO BE NINE MINUTES AND TWENTY NINE SECONDS HIS ACTIONS HAS NOT ONLY TERRORIZE THE FAMILY AND THE CITY. BY A TIRE NATION. THIS IS WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY. BECAUSE WE MUST CHANGE DOES NOT. PASSED AWAY ONE MINUTE FOR YOU. THANK YOU TO STOP THE PRACTICE OF USING POLICE OFFICERS TO DEHUMANIZE BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE AND BRING FAIR UNBIASED POLICING INTO BLACK AND BROWN NEIGHBORHOODS SO THAT WE ALL MAY BE SAFE AND SOMEDAY YOU BRING ABOUT TRUST BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE BLACK COMMUNITY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH DOCTOR PORTER WE APPRECIATE. YOUR INSIGHT AS WELL AS YOUR REMARKS- AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF YOU CAN JUST STAND BY- FOR A FEW MOMENTS WE MAY HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FROM OUR PANEL- AND THOSE WHO HAVE ALSO JOINED AS VIRTUALLY- FIRST OF ONE OVER THE LINE UP TO HAVE A FEW OPENING REMARKS FROM MY COLLEAGUE MISTER RUDY SALAS.

AFTER ME THEN I'LL GO TO THE PHONE LINE TO THOSE MEMBERS WERE JOINED AS VIRTUALLY FURTHER QUESTIONS OF THE PANEL SO WITH THAT BEING SAID MY FIRST QUESTION IS FROM FROM A COMMUNITY LANDS WHAT IS THE NEED TO MAKE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES WHOLE AGAIN AND CASES. OF POLICE. USING EXCESSIVE FORCE AND MISUSE OF MISUSING THEIR AUTHORITY- SO THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION. TO DR- PRICE SHARP ARE YOU STILL WITH THIS. I AM. IT SHOULD. I'M I GUESS I COULD BE A LITTLE CLARIFICATION OF WHAT YOU'RE ASKING. ABSOLUTELY LET ME REPEAT THE QUESTION AGAIN FROM AND THIS IS ALSO FOR ANY OF THE OTHER PANELS PENALISES WELL FROM A COMMUNITY LANDS WHAT IS THE NEED TO MAKE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES HOLD AGAIN IN CASES OF POLICE. USING EXCESSIVE FORCE AND MISUSING THEIR AUTHORITY. WE'LL KEEP ALL PRIVATE I THINK THAT FAMILIES ONLY TO. WE NOW HAVE ASSISTANCE AND THEY COULD BRING IN RECOVERING FROM SOMETHING THAT TRAGIC SO THAT IS THAT MY AREA OF EXPERTISE BUT I THINK THAT. ANY TIME A FAMILY LOSES A FAMILY MEMBER IT'S A SEVERE TRAGEDY AND THEY'RE GOING TO NEED HELP AND ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DOCTOR PORTER DID YOU HEAR THE QUESTION YOU WANT TO ELABORATE OR MISPLACED ON. FONG SURE I BELIEVE THAT. YOU NOTE FROM THE DOCTORS PRICE SERVICE- CORRECT THE FAMILY DOES NEED SUPPORT- THERE'S A TRAUMA THAT OCCURS. ON TO THE FAMILIES- WHETHER IT WAS ON. NO MATTER HOW THE- BURKE GOES DARK OR CHARGES MATT IS TO HAVE A FAMILY THAT LOST OF A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY AND THERE'S A TRAUMA THAT OCCURS FOUNDERS AND THERE'S A NEED FOR SUPPORT THESE FAMILIES ARE OFTEN- PUT INTO A PLACE IN IN PUBLIC- THAT THEY ARE NOT PREPARED FOR YOU KNOW HAD ON CNN THERE LONG BLOCK STATE AND EVERYTHING AND THEY'RE NOT PREPARED FOR IN ANY OF THIS. AND JUST SEEING THEIR FIRST HAND THEY DO NEED GUIDANCE IN DEALING HELP IN THAT AND THEY'LL BE- GOOD FOR THE STATE TO COME IN TO SUPPORT THESE FAMILY MEMBERS EITHER WAY NO MATTER WHAT ALL HELLO ON. THE- PERSON. YEAH OFTEN YES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR PORTER- ONE ASK ANOTHER QUESTION- WHAT ARE SOME OF THE LARGEST CONCERNS FOR RECOVERY WHAT ARE SOME OF THE LARGEST A CONCERNS OF FOR RECOVERY YOU KNOW THIS MONEY- IS IT THAT BAD APPLES BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND HAVING A MARKET PLACE ON THE RECORD OR HAVING CHARGES FILED AGAINST THEM WHAT ELSE IS NECESSARY AGAIN AS PART OF THE RECOVERY. ASPECT WHEN- AN OFFICER- YES MISUSED HIS OR HER AUTHORITY SO AGAIN- WHAT IS A LARGE CONCERNS FOR RECOVERY. THEY WON'T THAT QUESTION YOU GUYS JUMP IN. I'D LIKE TO I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS IT- IF I CAN AND THEN ALSO THE PREVIOUS QUESTION. IF POSSIBLE- IN REGARDS AND I THINK IT'S I'M I'LL BE ANSWERING BOTH QUESTIONS AND WITH MY ANSWER- I THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE A NUMBER OF THINGS TO MAKE FAMILIES FEEL LIKE THEY'RE GETTING WHAT THEY NEED OUT OF- THE SITUATION LIKE THE INCIDENT THAT THEY'VE EXPERIENCED IT'S GONNA THINK THEY'RE GONNA NEED MENTAL HEALTH HELP. THEY'RE GONNA NEED TIME TO BE ABLE TO TRY TO HEAL AND BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES OF MONEY FINANCIAL HELP- BUT THEY ALSO NEED TO SEE JUSTICE. AND NO JUSTICE MEANS NOT JUST WINNING A LAWSUIT BUT IN ITS I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT LAWSUITS I MEAN YOU KNOW WHATEVER THAT FAMILY WANTS TO PURSUE IS WHAT THEY SHOULD GET. BUT JUSTICE MEANS THAT THE OFFICERS THAT THAT GREW INTO THEIR TO THE SITUATION THAT PUT THEM IN THE SITUATION THEY NEED TO SEE SOME TYPE OF- REPERCUSSIONS THEY NEED TO SEE THAT THOSE OFFICERS ARE PENALIZED. THAT THEY'RE TREATED AS IF IT WAS BIKE IF I GO OUT AND SHOOT SOMEBODY OR- YOU KNOW PUT MY KNEE ON SOMEBODY'S NECK UNTIL THEY DIE- HOW WOULD I BE TREATED. WHAT I HAVE TO I WOULD HAVE TO GO TO THE COURTS I WOULD HAVE TO- YOU KNOW HAVE A JURY LISTEN TO MY TRIAL AND THEN I WOULD GET A PUNISHMENT THAT. SEEMS EFFICIENT FOR THE CRIME THAT I COMMITTED SO I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE PROCESS THAT'S BEEN MISSING AND THAT'S NEEDED. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE WHAT HELPS HEAL FAMILIES IT WON'T NONE OF THOSE THINGS. ALONE WORK I DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK JUST YOU KNOW SEEING. THE OFFICER GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS IS GOING TO HELP HEAL THE FAMILIES BY ITSELF. BUT IT ALL THOSE THINGS TOGETHER ARE GOING TO HELP TO BRING THOSE FAMILIES TO- TO A BETTER SPACE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOES ANYONE ELSE WANT TO ELABORATE ON THAT QUESTION- WE WILL GO TO- HERE IN THE AUDIENCE- WE SEE- MISTER COLLINS- PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON- YEAH I JUST TO. WANT TO GET THE PERSPECTIVE THAT IT'S BEYOND THE FAMILY I THINK WHAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED IS SO MUCH COMMUNITY SUPPORT- AND- BUT IT'S ALSO BECAUSE THE COMMUNITY ITSELF IS INJURED BY THIS SITUATION I THINK WHAT WE NEED FOR THAT IS A SENSE THAT THE SYSTEM IS JUST A SENSE THAT THE SYSTEM WILL INVESTIGATE ITSELF AND CAN CORRECT ANY WRONGS- SO FOR THE FAMILY THERE'S JUST DON'T NORMAL GRIEVING BUT WHEN YOU FEEL. THAT JUSTICE IS IN BEING CARRIED OUT AND YOU CAN'T TRUST A SYSTEM THAT MAKES THE PAIN THAT MUCH GREATER BUT I THINK IT'S NOT AGAIN JUST ABOUT THE FAMILY I THINK IT'S ABOUT THE COMMUNITY IN MANY WAYS WE HAVE BEEN APPROACHED BY SO MANY OTHER FAMILIES WHO HAVE NOT COME FORWARD BEFORE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN UP PUBLIC IN THEIR SUFFERING- SO WE KNOW WE HAVE MANY PEOPLE IN THE SAME SITUATION BUT WHAT'S SHOCKING IS. ONE OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT WE HAD FROM PEOPLE THAT KNEW ANGELO AND SOMETHING ABOUT ALL OF THIS COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT ARE HAVING DOUBTS ABOUT THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE AND I THINK THAT THE NUMBER ONE THING WE CAN DO FOR JUSTICE MAKING SURE THAT WHEN THAT SYSTEM MAKES MISTAKES WHEN THE IT NEEDS TO CORRECT DIRECTION IT IS ABLE TO DO SO IT DOESN'T CLOSE INTERNET SOFT. AND JUST. ATTACKED JUST QUO IT HAS TO. MAKE CHANGES LIKE ANY SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE AND WE NEED A SYSTEM WE CAN TRUST WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT WE THINK IS JUST AND I THINK THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE. THINK THAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T BRING ANGELA BACK BUT THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I THINK FOR THE COMMUNITY TO HEAL. IS TO BE ABLE TO REGAIN TRUST IN. THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE- AND I THINK FOR THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SOME REFORMS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT WE DON'T HAVE- OFTENTIMES. THERE'S TOO MUCH. OF IT YOU KNOW THEY'RE THERE YOU KNOW WHAT WE WERE TOLD THIS I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS AND FOR THE COVER UP THAT ONE SUIT. THIS OF THE MESSAGES WE'VEGOTTEN FROM OTHER FAMILIES- AND-SO WERE. WERE A LITTLE BIT WORRIED MORE THAN A LITTLE BIT WORRIED THAT THE SYSTEM ITSELF WON'T BE ABLE TO CORRECT. ITS OWN PROBLEMS AND THAT'S WHY I THINK YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARINGS AND- AND BRING THIS ISSUES THAT ARE REALLY DIFFICULT FORWARD- YOU KNOW THEIR BABY DOUBLE DIGITS FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED THE POLICE OFFICERS. AND THE FAMILIES BUT WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT CAN THAT CAN RECTIFY ITSELF. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE'RE HERE. WE'RE HERE TRYING TO. SEE HOW WE CAN CORRECT THE SYSTEM. AND MAKE THE SYSTEM BETTER- I WANT TO GO TO OUR LINE WE HAVE A MAJORITY LEADER- MISS ELOISE RASCAL I'M SORRY JUST HOLD ON ONE MOMENT I WANTED TO FOR TO- I WANNA GO TO MISTER TOM LACKEY WAS WITH US. AND THEN I'LL GO TO MYSTERIOUS. THERE'S A REASON THAT- THIS PROBLEM HAS EXISTED FOR A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME THERE'S JUST A LOT OF MISUNDERSTANDING ON MANY FRIENDS BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE DEALING WITH SUCH A VERY VERY DELICATE EMOTIONS YOU'RE YOU'RE DEALING WITH FEAR YOU'RE DEALING WITH- ANGER AND OFTEN TIMES VIOLENCE. AND WHAT HAPPENS IS I THINK THINGS COULD BE MIS CHARACTERIZED MISUNDERSTOOD BECAUSE OF THE VOLATILITY OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUT WHAT I THINK IS VERY VERY VERY VITAL IS THAT WE- WE'RE ABLE TO OPENLY. SB TRANSPARENT FROM BOTH SIDES AND BE SYMPATHETIC TO BOTH SIDES BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHEN YOU GET REMEDY- IF IT IF IT BECOMES TOO LOPSIDED. THEN I THINK SOMETIMES OUR VISION GETS BLURRY SO I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN HAVE CLARITY AND THAT WE CAN BE HONEST AND THAT WE CAN HAVE MEANINGFUL DIALOGUE TOGETHER SO THAT WE CAN HILL BECAUSE WHAT WE DID IS BRIDGE. BUT THAT'S REALLY I HOPE WHAT EVERYBODY IS SEEKING- AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO BE A PART OF THAT DISCUSSION AND PART OF THAT BRIDGE BECAUSE IT REALLY IS. CRITICAL THAT WE BRIDGE THIS RELATIONSHIP THAT IS SO FRACTURED. MISTER. I CANNOT HEAR YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME. THANK YOU SO MUCH I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE FAMILY OF. ANGELO CAN GO- SPECIFICALLY FOR HIS MOTHER. AND I APPRECIATE SO MUCH THAT YOUR COURAGE TO BE HERE AND TO SHARE YOUR PERSONAL. EXPERIENCE AYE I HONESTLY CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH. AND I THINK THAT FOR ME I WANT TO HEAR SPECIFICALLY FROM YOU. EIGHT WHAT- WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED IS THAT- EXCESSIVE FORCE CLEARLY THAT YOU HAVE SHARED. OTHER HAS BEEN DISCUSSION ABOUT HAVING MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS COME ON THESE CALLS THE WHAT IS YOUR THOUGHT ON THAT SPECIFICALLY. OUR WERE- FIRST THING THEY SHOULD'VE DONE. WAS YOU KNOW THE SAW THAT HE WAS NOT VIOLENT THERE'S JUST NO REASON HE WAS COMPLIANT SO THERE'S NO REASON FOR THAT KIND OF RESTRAINT THAT THE DEAD. AND ALSO WITH THE MENTAL MENTAL HEALTH- I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BENEFICIAL FOR US TO SPEAK ON THAT A LITTLE BIT SURE THE MENTAL SORRY MISS BECOME A LITTLE BIT- WHAT WE'RE ADVOCATING FOR VERY ACTIVELY RIGHT NOW IS ACTUALLY MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS RESPONSE TEAMS I ONE WHO CALLED THE POLICE AND I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY THAT I CHOSE THAT BECAUSE IT FELT LIKE MY ONLY OTHER OPTION WHEN- MY DAD WAS TOO FAR AWAY- AND I. THERE ARE VERY FEW THINGS I CAN GUARANTEE- BUT I BELIEVE THAT IF THERE HAD BEEN OTHER OPTIONS- ESPECIALLY FOR HEALTH CRISES I ABSOLUTELY WOULD HAVE CALLED THEM. YOU ARE. I DID ASK THEM MULTIPLE TIMES IF THERE WAS SOMEBODY ELSE I COULD CALL AND THEY SAID NO. YEAH SO. IT WOULD OF. YEAH I'M SORRY. FOR YOUR QUESTION YES THAT THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE. THOSE WHO HAVE SUFFERED THE MOST B. THE STRONGEST VOICE THE BIGGEST ADVOCATES BECAUSE YOU YOU THAT YOU WERE THERE YOU EXPERIENCED IT. AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS YOU FEEL COULD HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE HERE SO YOUR VOICE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. AB MRS. COLUMNS YES. YOU MADE A COMMENT THAT BROKE MY HEART YOU SAID THAT THEY TRIED TO TELL YOU THAT. YOU WERE PART OF THE CAUSE. OF YOUR SON'S DEATH. WHERE THE INLAND. ON THEIR PRESS CONFERENCE IN- THE D. DAY WERE DENYING IT THE THEY SAID THERE WAS NO NEED TO THE NECK- THE WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM YOU KNOW THE ONES THAT HE SUSTAINED THAT NIGHT WAS FROM THE STRUGGLES WITH THE FAMILY MEMBERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT WHICH NEVER HAPPENED- NOTHING LIKE THAT HAPPENED. IT AYE I WANTED TO BRING ATTENTION TO IT JUST TO REMIND YOU THAT YOU YOU HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT WITH YOUR SON'S DEATH. AND I HOPE YOU YOU DO YOU HAVE NOTE THAT IT WHAT YOU DID IS EXACTLY WHAT A MOTHER WHAT A FAMILY WOULD DO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BEST HLP YOUR YOUR SON AND IF THERE IS NOTHING YOU DID THAT WAS WRONG AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT. NOTHING YOU DID WAS WRONG YOU CALLED EXACTLY WELL YOU COULD HAVE CALLED FOR HELP AT THAT MOMENT BECAUSE YOU WERE TRYING TO HELP YOUR SON AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HEAR THAT MESSAGE THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE SOMETIME THANK YOU JUST OH I'M SORRY YES SOMETIMES YOU KNOW YOU I CAN'T LATE I TRIED TO BLAME MYSELF FOR WHAT HAPPENED- I KIND OF SAY YOU KNOW IF I SHOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING WHAT I MEAN. DID I DO THE RIGHT THING I SHOULD OF YOU KNOW SAID SOMETHING TO THEM WHEN I SAW. THEM DOING THAT YOU KNOW NEEDING. YEAH AND WE WILL SEE. THE SAME THING WITH THE GEORGE FLOYD TRIAL. WE ARE SEEING THE YOUNG CLERK BLAME HIMSELF FOR HAVING CALLED THE POLICE. FOR THE COUNTERFEIT DOLLAR- THAT HE FELT THAT THAT THAT NOW ON IN RETROSPECT. BUT EVERYBODY DOES THE BEST THAT THEY CAN AT THAT MOMENT YOU DID EXACTLY WHAT ANY PARENT WOULD HAVE DONE. AND I AM SO SORRY SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I EIGHT EIGHT QUESTIONS NOW MISTER CHIP REPORT- TANYA FAISON. FOR S. I HI I WANTED TO ASK IF YOU HAVE NOTICED ANY CHANGES IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND THE COMMUNITY SINCE THE SUMMER OR SENSE OF SINCE WE THERE THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH MORE AND THE BEGINNING OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE BUT I CHAIR GIPSON- I HAVE NOT- I'VE SEEN. WHAT WHAT AYE TENNESSEE LOCALLY IS- THE POLICE CHIEF WILL MAKE STATEMENTS THAT YOU KNOW. APPEAR AS IF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IT IS GOING TO MOVE DIFFERENTLY BUT WHEN YOU'RE IN IN THE COMMUNITY- THOSE IT'S THE SAME THING THERE'S STILL A LOT OF HARASSMENT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF THERE'S- I'M FROM OAK PARK IN SACRAMENTO- AND IN THAT COMMUNITY BY ITSELF. YOU'VE GOT SACKED PT POLICING THAT JURISDICTION'S ACTUAR US YOU'VE GOT THAT MCGEORGE SCHOOL OF LAW POLICE UNIVERSITY PACIFIC POLICE YOU GOT THE UC DAVIS WHICH IS A HOSPITAL THERE POLICE THEY LEAVE THE CAMPUS TO THE POLICE THE COMMUNITY. AND THEN YOU'VE GOT A SECURITY TEAM THAT IS CONTRACTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT SO THAT ONE COMMUNITY IS POLICED BY ALL THOSE DIFFERENT ENTITIES. AND IT'S A HEAVILY GENTRIFIED COMMUNITY AND SO YOU HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE CALLING THE POLICE ON FOLKS THAT ARE NOW DISPLACED AND HOMELESS OR YOU KNOW FROM THAT COMMUNITY TRYING TO YOU KNOW KEEP THEIR COMMUNITY HOW IT USED TO LOOK BEING IN THE PARK HANGING OUT. I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING FOR YEARS DECADES AND SO YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF POLICE HARASSING INDIVIDUALS- PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS DALY. SO WHEN I COP WATCH I'LL SEE LIKE THIS ONE PERSON THAT I KNOW WHO GETS PULLED OVER NUMEROUS TIMES IN A MATTER OF WEEKS AND SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT I'M SEEING EXPERIENCE. AND JUST. I PUT IT IN AN- BECAUSE IT I HEARD SOMEONE SAY THAT WE NEED TO BUILD A BRIDGE AND I'VE HEARD THAT TERM USED A LOT OF TIMES. BUT I WANT PEOPLE TO LOOK AT THE ABUSE THAT HAPPENS ON BROWN AND BLACK COMMUNITIES. AS AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP. AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE WE'VE GOT A WE'VE GOT DECADES OF AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP. AND THE ABUSE IS THE BROWN AND BLACK PEOPLE IN THESE COMMUNITIES AND THE ABUSER IS THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. AND YOU'RE NEVER GONNA TELL AN ABUSED PERSON TO BUILD A BRIDGE WITH THEIR ABUSER YOU'RE GOING TO TELL THE USER TO GET WHAT THEY NEED TO STOP DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING- AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO SEE. WE DON'T NEED TO SEE BROWN BLACK PEOPLE DOING ANYTHING TO MAKE SURE THAT PLEASE FEEL COMFORTABLE AND HAPPY AND- AND LIKE WE LIKE THEM AGAIN. WE NEED TO SEE THE ABUSE STOP HAPPENING SO I JUST WANTED AT THAT. THANK YOU RIGHT I THINK THAT THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT COMMENT AND I THINK THAT IF WE TAKE THAT WITH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY'S COMMENTS- I THINK WHAT WE'VE GOT TO WE'VE GOT TO MOVE FORWARD. YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY HOUSE EXPERIENCE. THAT THE REST OF US MAY NOT HAVE AND WHEN YOU HAVE. GOOD COPS WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO ELEVATE THEM SO THAT THE OTHERS DOWN KNOW WHAT GOOD BEHAVIORS LIKE- AND IN THAT REGARD AYE AYE I DO APPLAUD ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY FOR HIS YEARS OF SERVICE IN THAT REGARD. AND THAT THAT'S THE KIND OF BEHAVIOR COURTS NOT AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP BUT YOU ARE RIGHT IF IT IS AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP OFTENTIMES WE LOOK TO THE VICTIM TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR RATHER THAN THE ABUSER AND I AGREE WITH YOU THAT DOES NEED TO STOP. BUT LET WILL FIND WAYS TO USE BOTH COMMENTS TO COME TO SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. ESPECIALLY ARE BROWN AND BLACK COMMUNITIES THAT- BY BY ALL INDICATIONS BY ALL STATISTICS ARE THE ONES THAT SUFFER MOST IN THIS REGARD. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENT AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR ALLOWING ME TO SHARE A FEW COMMENTS. THE RELATIONSHIP- OUR JOB IS TO PASS LEGISLATION IT ISN'T IT TO BE ON THE GROUND ALTHOUGH ALL OF US I AND ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES AND I SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN THE COMMUNITY. BUT WHAT IS IT WE CAN DO IS LEGISLATORS TO IMPROVE THIS RELATIONSHIP- BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE COMMUNITY. I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO VIEW. LAW ENFORCEMENT AS A SYSTEM INSTEAD OF AN INDIVIDUAL LIKE INDIVIDUAL OFFICERS BECAUSE IT'S A SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS FOR OFFICERS WHETHER THEY'RE GOOD OR BAD TO DO WHATEVER IT IS THAT THEY'VE DONE AND SO THAT'S WHERE THE PROBLEM IS AND THAT'S THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM- AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT LEGISLATORS CAN DO IS TO HELP FIX RID OF THE PROBLEM. ISSUES AYE WE SEE A LOT OF BANDAIDS WE SEE A LOT OF- YOU KNOW TEMPORARY FIXES OR YOU KNOW GOOD STATEMENTS ARE PERFORMATIVE GESTURES- BUT WE NEED TO SEE ACTUAL ROOT OF THE PROBLEM FIXES WHERE LAWS ARE ACTUALLY BEING MADE THAT. HONESTLY I FEEL LIKE. IF THERE IS A PUNISHMENT IN PLACE FOR OFFICERS THAT. HARM PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY AND I FEEL LIKE. THAT THE HARM WILL STOP ITS OFFICERS KNOW THAT THEY WILL. BE FIRED AND POSSIBLY BE INCARCERATED. FOR MURDERING SOMEBODY THEN THAT WILL STOP. IT'LL MAKE THEM THINK TWICE- BEFORE DOING ANYTHING AND- IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT. YOU KNOW ALL THESE OFFICERS ARE GOING TO GO TO JAIL NOW LET'S GET IT IT'S IT MEANS THAT OFFICERS WILL NO LONGER JUMP TO. RESORTING TO EXCESSIVE FORCE OR VIOLENCE ON THE FIRST RESPONSE SO I THINK IN EVERYBODY'S LIFE WE ALL HAVE JOBS THAT WE DO AND WE ALL HAVE CHALLENGES ON OUR JOBS AND WE HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS ON OUR CHALLENGES AND WE ALWAYS THINK ABOUT AM I GOING TO LOSE MY JOB IF I MAKE THIS BAD DECISION. AND SO THAT'S WHAT I THINK THAT OFFICERS NEED TO HAVE THE SAME TYPE OF- YOU KNOW PROCESS RIGHT NOW THERE ARE. YOU KNOW. FOR EVER THEY'VE BEEN GETTING AWAY WITH KILLING US SO. THAT IS THE EXAMPLE THAT'S BEEN SET AND THAT IS. I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S HURTING. OUR COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU AND THEY'LL TAKE TAKE THIS MOMENT TARGET TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP- IN IN THE SPACE YOUR YOUR VOICE HAS BEEN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH I APPRECIATE YOU MISTER CHAIR. CAN YOU HAVE THEM. YOUR MOTHER CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW YES OKAY. WE'LL GET IT TOGETHER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL GET IT TOGETHER- I WANT TO GO TO A DOCTOR PORTER- PAST REPORTER WITH RESPECT TO THIS NEXT QUESTION- WHAT IS YOU FROM YOUR LAND WHAT NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE IN RELATION REGARDING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT MOVING FORWARD WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR SUGGESTIONS- BECAUSE YOU SERVE AS THE STATE PRESIDENT OF NATIONAL ACTION NETWORK- IN A PASSED IN THE COMMUNITY IN SACRAMENTO- AND FOR YOU ACTIVISM WHAT CAN YOU SUGGEST TO US. THAT CAN BETTER CREATE A BETTER WORKING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY. AND POLICE AND POLICE AND THE COMMUNITY. DOCTOR PORTER CORRECT. YEAH THANK YOU ALL WELL YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN- STATED CLEARLY BEFORE THE TOP OF THE TINY AND NOW- GOT OUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER HERE. I'LL ACCOUNTABILITY I THINK IS THE KEY. WORD HERE THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR ACCOUNTABILITY- FOR BAD ACTIONS I THINK IT'S JUST THE SAMPLES THAT WE WANT ALL FAIRNESS WANT JUSTICE- THAT WOULD HELP TO RESTORE TRUST. ME NO. BAD PEOPLE BROTHER THEY'RE- POLICE OR OTHERWISE DO BAD THINGS THEY SHOULD BE THEY SHOULD BE HELD. ACCOUNTABLE AND- HOW THE APPROPRIATE CONSEQUENCES AND SO I THINK A RESTORING OF FAIRNESS IN OUR LAW MAKING- IS KEYS SO THAT ABOUT BY DOING SO WE STORES ARE CONFIDENCE AND TRUST. RETRAIN- COMMUNITY LONG. WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN HEARING TRAIN TRAIN TRY TRAINING ALL THESE YEARS AND WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY PROGRESS WITH THAT SO THIS IS NOT A TRAINING ISSUE THIS IS WHAT I AM SAYING IS HOW PEOPLE ARE PERCEIVED IT. IS OUR CULTURAL IS SYSTEMIC AND WE HAVE TO ATTACK IT IN THAT MATTER WE CAN'T JUST ATTACK THE SYMPTOMS WE HAVE TO ATTACK OF THE WATCH CHIU WE ARE HIGHER IN THESE. AS HELLO. OFFICIALS WITHIN THESE COMMUNITIES- J. HIRE PEOPLE WHO ARE SCARED OF THE CERTAIN CULTURES AND WE'RE NOT BEEN EXPOSED WE'RE NOT CLOSELY CROPPED COMPETENT. AND ALL THAT AND SO WE- NEED TO WE LOOK AT OUR HIRING PRACTICES ADDED AGAIN. I GO BACK TO WORK ON THE BILL THE IT DOES THE FUTURE HEALTH STORE THE CONFIDENCE OR ACTUALLY BRING ABOUT CONFIDENCE AND TRUST IN OUR MARKET MINISTRY. LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU VERY. OF TRAUMA- I WANT TO GO TO THE DOCTOR- DR PRICE SHARP WITH RESPECT TO YOUR WORK YOUR EXPERIENCE IN THE AREA OF TRAUMA CAN YOU ELABORATE- FROM THE OFFICER'S STANDPOINT AND ALSO ANY VICTIMS. OR FAMILIES REGARDING TRAUMA THAT YOU CAN- PROVIDES- SOME TESTIMONIES AND ALSO EXPERIENCE WITH. HELLO AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. I THINK THAT OFFICER MENTAL HEALTH IS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPORTANT FROM THE RESULT I'D SAY THAT IS BECAUSE IF AN OFFICER IS NOT MENTALLY HEALTHY AND THAT CAN IMPACT. THE BILL TO THEIR JOB AND TO OUR ACTS WITH THE COMMUNITY. OBVIOUSLY WHAT IS GOING ON WITH OUR COMMUNITY IS ALSO EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND PROVIDING A BRIDGE FOR. PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER AND FIGURE OUT POLLUTION THAT ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO BRING HEALING TO EVERYONE- I THINK- IS HAVE EXTREME IMPORTANCE MANY OFFICERS- YOU KNOW REALLY STRUGGLE WITH. AND SO MAKING SURE THAT THOSE OFFICERS GET THE HELP THAT THEY NEED BECAUSE THAT WAY THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO USE THAT PROPERTY OWNERS- AND HAVING THEM MENTORED BY THOSE GOOD OFFICERS THAT ARE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR COMMUNITY EFFECTIVELY- AND- TO BRING UITY TO THAT COMMUNITY. I THINK THAT MENTORING PROCESSES GOOD MENTAL ALL CHECK INS I THINK ARE REALLY IMPORTANT I DO WELL LET'S CHECK IN WITH A COUPLE OF DEPARTMENTS AND I THINK THOSE ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY HELP THE COPS BECAUSE MENTALLY HEALTHY COPS RESPOND. AN APPROPRIATE WAY AND SO THAT I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT TO BRING HEALING TO BALK BOB GOOD- BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF OFFICE THAT ARE STRUGGLING WITH PTSD AND DEPRESSION ON THEM. AND THAT THAT ALSO GOING TO INFLUENCE THEIR RESPONSES TO THE COMMUNITY- I THINK THESE ARE IMPORTANT TOPICS AND THE MORE WE CAN BECOME UNIFIED AND THE- I. ADDRESS THE ENTIRE PROBLEM IT'S. GOING TO BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- YOU ALSO MAY MINUTES OF THE TRUCK THAT PLEASE OFFER HAVE A BLOG THROUGH- AND I KNOW THAT YOU I WORK FOR THE NUMBER OF POLICE OFFICERS HAVE YOU AND I PLEASE FORGIVE ME IF YOU'VE ALREADY SAID THIS HAVE YOU. EVER ADDRESS POLICE OFFICER INVOLVED IN SHOOTING AND IF SO HOW WAS THE OUTCOME IF YOU COULD ELABORATE AND WHAT KIND OF SERVICES THAT YOU PROVIDE. AND THE REASON WHY FRAME THAT QUESTION I'M SORRY THE REASON WHY FRAME THAT QUESTION IS BECAUSE- WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM. THE KETO FAMILY AND OTHERS IS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE- OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTING OR OFFICER NEGATIVE CON CONTACT. ARE THERE SOME TRAUMA THERE AND SO LOOKING AT HOW DO WE TRY TO ADDRESS THE TRAUMA. FROM THE COMMUNITY STANDPOINT AS WELL AS THE OFFICE'S STANDPOINT AND SO THAT'S THE REASON WHY I POSED A QUESTION- AS I AS I DID. SO OUT OF YOU CAN PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS WITH RESPECT TO TRAUMA. OFFICERS AND COMMUNITY AND VICTIMS. ABSOLUTELY AND I HAVE MET WITH MANY OFFICERS AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN IN A SHOOTING AND I'VE ALSO TREATED THEIR- OFFICERS BUT SIGNIFICANT PTS. AFTER THEY'VE DONE IN THIS YEAR ALONE AND SO HELPING- THEM TO RE CALIBRATE THEIR SYSTEM SET UP AND TAKE THE NUMBER OF DAYS FOR THAT OFFICER TO. COMPLETELY COME DOWN FROM THAT MUCH OF ADRENALINE AND THAT MUCH CORTISOL THE NEEDS. AND FELL ON AVERAGE IT TAKES ABOUT TEN DAYS ACCORDING TO THE LETTERS CARE SELL. OUT SOMETIMES DEPARTMENT- MAYBE ARE NOT AS AWARE OF SOME OF THOSE- RESEARCH FINDINGS HIMSELF. HELPING OFFICERS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A FEW DAYS TOP TO BE ABLE TO RECALIBRATE SO THEY'RE NOT GOING BACK IN THE FIELD- YOU KNOW VERY- EXHAUSTED AND NOT ABLE TO FUNCTION IN A FULL CAPACITY I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT. AND ALSO HELPING THEM TO DEAL WITH THE DECISIONS THAT THEY THEY MADE WHETHER THEY WERE GOOD AND BAD DECISIONS AT. THAT MOMENT- GO AHEAD. OKAY NO CREDIT. OKAY SO I THINK- HELPING DAMAGE- GOOD TO BEGIN WITH WHICH IS THE- MUTUALLY ARETHA OF TRYING- BUT ALSO THEM TO COMPLY BECAUSE BEST THEY GO ON- I WERE TALK EXTENSIVELY TO OFFICERS AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE READY TO RETURN TO FULL DUTY BECAUSE RETURNING THEM- SOMETIMES SMALL DEPARTMENT- THEY THEY DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF LETTING THEM STAY OSCAR VERY LONG BECAUSE THEY HAVE SUCH SHORT STAFFING- SO I THINK THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE- AND ALSO HAVING DEPARTMENTS UNDERSTAND THAT AN OFFICER DOES NEED TIME TO RECOVER. AND ALSO IF THERE WAS A TRAINING ISSUE OR THEY DID SOMETHING THAT WASN'T CORRECT MAKES BUT THAT THEY HAVE THE PROPER TRAINING AND. SUPPORT BEFORE THEY RETURN. I WANT TO THIS ASK ONE FOLLOW PLACE IS THERE A- AFTER THE OFFICE OF IN SHE- WHETHER RESULTS IN ALLOW BEING. OR DISCHARGING HIS OR HER FIRE ARM BEFORE HERE. IS ALLOWED TO COME BACK TO WORK IS THERE A TIME BECAUSE YOU MAKE MENTION SMALLER DEPARTMENTS THEY NEED THAT OFFICER BACK SO THE TIME MAY BE SHORTER BUT IS THERE A STANDARD IN THIS IN IN THIS SPACE. THAT REQUIRES X. AMOUNT OF TIME FOR OFFICER TO- B. BURKE- RETURNED BACK TO WORK AND FOR WORK BEFORE HITTING THE STREET IS THERE A TIME. THAT IS SUFFICIENT. OR STANDARD. THAT IS A VERY VERY GOOD AND VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION- NO THERE IS NO STANDARD AND I HAVE ACTUALLY KNOWN OFFICERS WHO WERE IN A SHOOTING IN THE MORNING AND ENDED UP GOING BACK TO WORK IN THE AFTERNOON I KNOW ONE CASE THAT HAPPENED- ABSOLUTELY GO THE OPPOSITE WAS ACTUALLY SHOT- AND THEN ALSO RETURNED FIRE AND WAS BACK IN THE OFFICE IN THE AFTERNOON WITH BANDAGES ON HIS LEG AND BACK OUT ON PATROL YOU KNOW SO I THINK THAT OFFICER MENTAL HEALTH AND HAFIZ'S PHYSICAL HEALTH IS. IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT BAD BECAUSE THIS THIS IS A TRAGEDY FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED AND SO I THINK THAT THOSE ARE SOME THINGS TO LOOK AT THAT OPPOSITION MENTAL HOAXES. COMPONENT IS SO IMPORTANT. THANK VERY MUCH- WHAT TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS- MISTER LUCKY YOU HAVE NO QUESTIONS I HAVE NO ONE IN THE QUEUE ONLINE MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE JOINING US VIRTUALLY- SO WE'LL MOVE ON WE WANT TO THANK. YOU ALL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- WE WANT TO MOVE TO OUR NEXT PANEL INTO AGAIN APPRECIATE.

AGAIN WE APPRECIATE YOUR INPUT- THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED HERE TODAY TO THE SELECT COMMITTEE HEARING. SO WITH THAT. BEING SAID I WANT TO MOVE TO- JULIA YOU I'M SURE THE PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY PROJECT. IN P. A. P. A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA WHO PARTICIPATING VIRTUALLY- SHE ACTUALLY MAY BE JOINING US ON THE PHONE I UNDERSTAND THERE WERE SOME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES- MISS YOU ARE YOU WITH US. SIR I AM HERE. THAT I TO. TURN ON THE VIDEO. OKAY WE CAN WE CAN REALLY REALLY WELL SO IF YOU COULD PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND THEN MOVE RIDE YOUR PRESENTATION. THANK YOU SO MUCH THERE GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS JULIE YEAH HERO AND A CIVIL RIGHTS. AND SENDING A GIRL CALIFORNIA I SPENT ON THE BOARD OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA I AM ALSO THE PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY PROJECT WHICH IS. THE LARGEST CIVIL RIGHT ATTORNEY ORGANIZATION I IN THE UNITED STATES WE HAVE OVER SIX HUNDRED ATTORNEY MEMBERS WHO SPECIALIZE IN PLACEMENTS CONTACT WE HAVE OVER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND MEMBERS SUPPORTERS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY FROM ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES- IN ADDITION TO TRAINING OUR ATTORNEY MEMBERS AND P. EIGHTY PROVIDES OUR EXPERTISE. TO STATE AND FEDERAL LEGISLATORS ON POLICING REFORMS MOST RECENTLY IN COLORADO- NEW YORK AND NEW MEXICO WHERE THE CIVIL RIGHTS BILL IS WAITING FOR THE GOVERNOR'S SIGNATURE. WE WORK WITH COMMUNITY GROUPS TO FACILITATE DIALOGUE AMONG LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE IMPACTED COMMUNITIES- I THINK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS. HOW WE AS A COUNTRY CAN HEAL ESPECIALLY DURING THIS TRAUMATIZING TIMES IN THE MIDDLE OF DEREK SHOWBIZ CRIMINAL TRIAL. I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS WITH YOU WHAT WE MUST DO IN OUR CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM. WE GET TO A PLACE OF HEALING. WELL FIRST COMMUNITIES RECOVER FROM THE TIME. UNTIL THERE IS PASSED TO JUST IN THE COURTS VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND THE MENTAL VERSUS OF GOVERNANCE IS THAT NO MAN IS ABOVE THE LAW AND BOTH CHIANG AND POPPER MY STATE HERE TO THE SAME SET OF RULES. BUT QUALIFIED IMMUNITY IN FEDERAL COURT AND ABSOLUTE IMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA EXCELLENT PORTS THE ROLE WOULD BE SPRINTS THE PULSE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. IMMUNITIES DESTROY COMMUNITY TRUST AND CREATE THE PERCEPTION ACCESS STUNNED WHERE POLICE MAKE JAIL BE MAIMED AND LIE WITH IMPUNITY WHILE THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS STATE POLICE ARE INCARCERATED AND VICTIMIZED WITH NO RECOURSE AND PARKS THE VINDICATE THEIR RIGHTS FOR EVERY GEORGE FLOYD EVERY BRIANNA TAYLOR THERE ARE THOUSANDS THAT GET DOWN WHOSE NAMES WE WILL NEVER HEAR SHE. BECAUSE THEY ARE DENIED JUSTICE. IN A COUNTRY WHERE OUR FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE EQUALITY UNDER THE LAW OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS ESPECIALLY OUR YOUNG PEOPLE OF COLOR VIEW THAT THE DO NOT. THEY DO THEY'RE NOT BEING TREATED FAIRLY IMMUNITIES EATING AWAY AT OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE TO THAT EFFECT- THAT. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS ARE ALWAYS ABOVE THE LAW. AND HERE IS WHAT IS AT THE HEART OF THE PROBLEM IN FEDERAL COURT WELL IN FIGHTING MANY PROTECTS OFFICERS FROM LIABILITY EVEN IF AN OFFICER IS FOUND TO HAVE VIOLATED THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF SOMEONE. THE VICTIM WILL STILL LOSE THAT CASE UNLESS THEY CAN PROVE. THAT THE PARTICULAR EXXON DOT WEISS FOUND TO HAVE BEEN UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN A PRIOR CASE. WHAT I NEED BY THAT BY SAMPLE THERE WAS A CASE CALLED JESSOP IN CALIFORNIA A FEW YEARS AGO THAT IS WHERE POLICE OFFICERS CAME TO EXECUTE A SEARCH WARRANT IN BASS STOLE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF CASH AND GOLD COINS. THE NINTH CIRCUIT FOUND THAT THE OFFICER SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT STEALING IS MORALLY WRONG. BUT BECAUSE THERE WAS NO PRIOR CASE SAYING THAT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL THE PLAINTIFF IN THAT CASE THE VICTIM STILL LOSES. AND WHAT IS EVEN MORE PAINFUL IS THAT AT THAT MOMENT THE NINTH CIRCUIT DID NOT SAY AFFIRMATIVELY. GOING FORWARD AS OF TO DATE STEALING IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL SO THE LAW IS STILL REMAINS THAT AN OFFICER IS STILL TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND YOU CAN'T SUE THEM FOR THAT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PROVE THAT. IT WAS CLEARLY ESTABLISHED. I EVEN WITHOUT QUALIFY IMMUNITY. VICTIMS IN FOR IN FEDERAL COURT. ONE OUT OF EVERY FOUR ACTIVE FEDERAL JUDGES TO DATE IS A TRUMP APPOINTEE. AND GIVEN THE RHETORIC THAT HAS COME OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS. VICTIMS OF POLICE MISCONDUCT WELL ARE MOST OFTEN BLACK OR BROWN. D. DEEP SENSE OF MISTRUST BASED MISTRUST IS UNDOUBTEDLY AND AMPLIFIED BY THE DEADLY RIOTS AT THE CAPITOL ON JANUARY SIXTH TWENTY TWENTY AS THE NATION WATCHED POLICE OFFICERS ON WE ALLOW PARAKEETS TO OPEN TO THE LAW LICENSE NOT LESS MODERN. AND TAKES SELFIE WITH THE MASTIC KERIS. THE WORLD WHAT DONALD TRUMP CONTRACT VIOLENCE IN NOTED THAT DISTRICT TREATMENT OF THE LARGELY WHITE WRITER AND THE TREATMENT OF PROTESTERS. JOSH THIS PAST SUMMER. LORD BE. SHOT WITH PROJECTILE WEAPONS TEAR GAS SOAKED IN CHEMICAL WEAPONS CHANNELED AND SUBJECT TO MASS FALSE ARREST FOR PEACEFULLY CHANTING AND HOLDING SIGNS. WE SAW THIS PLAY OUT ON TV IN FRONT OF US. GIVEN THESE PROBLEMS AND PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS OF FAIRNESS IT ISCRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT VICTIMS OF MISCONDUCT AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN CALIFORNIA STATE COURT. WHERE THE BANE ACT PROTECTS THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF THE VICTIMS OF THIS CONTACT. SIMILAR TO THE FEDERAL LAW WHICH ALLOWS VICTIMS OF GOVERNMENTAL AND BEAT YOU TO SEEK JUSTICE IN FEDERAL COURT THE BANE ACT ALLOWS CALIFORNIANS TO SEEK JUSTICE IN THEIR STATE PARKS. HOWEVER THE BILLION ACTIVE ABSOLUTE IMMUNITY TO OFFICERS WHO FRAME INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE PLANTING EVIDENCE AND LYING UNDER OATH. FOR EXAMPLE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN A LOS ANGELES POLICE OFFICER ACCIDENTALLY FILMED HIMSELF PLACING A PACKAGE OF PROTEIN IN A SUSPECT WHILE IT. IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY THE LOS ANGELES DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE REVEAL HER TOWARD- UP TO TWENTY FIVE LAPD OFFICERS WERE UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR FALSIFYING RECORDS ABOUT ARRESTEES GANG AFFILIATIONS WHICH ALLOWS PROSECUTORS TO SEEK HARSHER SENTENCES AGAINST DEFENDANTS. WHICH SOMETIMES STATES INNOCENTLY. I THE INTERNET. IN CALIFORNIA OFFICERS MIGHT EVIDENCE BONTA RECORDS AND LYING UNDER OATH THANK YOU KNOW RELEVANCE THE IMMUNITY IS ABSOLUTE AND IT BECOMES MADE NOT RESTRICT ACCESS FOR MALICIOUS PROSECUTION. IT ENDED UP BEING ACT IN CALIFORNIA. UNLIKE FEDERAL COURTS CALIFORNIA DO NOT ALLOW MEETING FAMILY MEMBERS TO BRING A SUIT FOR WRONGFUL DEATH ARE THE BANE ACT THE COMMUNITY IS WELL AWARE OF THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT. ONE OUT OF EVERY ONE THOUSAND BLACK MALES EXPECT TO GET KILLED BY THE POLICE IN NUYS WANTED THAT STATISTICAL ANALYSIS THAT HAS BEEN OUT THERE IN THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY WE KNOW THAT ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN PEOPLE WERE KILLED AT THE HANDS OF THE POLICE. BLACK PEOPLE WERE KILLED- 28% RATES OUT WHY DON'T WE ONLY 13% OF THE ENTIRE POPULATION. JUST. SENATOR BRADFORD- I SPEECH TO ADDRESSING DECERTIFICATION AND AMENDING THE PAIN ACT WOULD REMEDY THESE PROBLEMS AND ALLOW THE COMMUNITY TO FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE A FAIR SHOT. IMMUNITIES CREATES TOUGH ENVIRONMENT A COMMUNITY DISTRUST IN WHICH WE PUBLICLY OBSERVER THAT OFFICERS ACT WITH EACH UNITY. I'M DOING THE HARMS OF QUALIFIED AN ABSOLUTE IMMUNITY IS ONE STEP BUT THIS. CANNSTATT TOWARDS TRANS TRUE TRANSFORMATION OF THE SYSTEM OF RACIAL EQUALITY IN ADDITION TO ERODING ANY SENSE THAT EQUITY IN OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. IMMUNITIES ALSO HARM POLICE OFFICERS THE MAJORITY OF WHO ENTER THE PROFESSION WITH THE TRUE SENSE OF PURPOSE TO SERVE THE PUBLIC. IMMUNITY IS TAKE AWAY THE PUBLIC TRUST AND CONFIDENCE THAT IS CRITICAL FOR OFFICER SAFETY AND EFFECTIVE POLICING WHEN WE HAVE SUCH A BY IN SUCH DISTRUST EVERY SINGLE SINGLE LAW ENFORCEMENT ENCOUNTER IS SET UP FOR FAILURE. WE MUST HAVE A MECHANISM TO DECERTIFY LAB WORKING OFFICERS SO THAT WE CAN BRING HONOR BACK THE PROFESSION. IT IS TIME TO BRING HONOR. AND SRI. I OFFICIALS LIKE THE PROFESSIONALS LICENSE FOR THAT THEY ARE ENTITIES TIME TO HOLD OUR POLICE OFFICER. ACCOUNTABLE I IN LASTLY A LONG LONG ROAD TO HEALING AWAITS THIS COUNTRY AND THE COMMUNITIES HUNGER AND DEMAND FOR MARKETS CREDIBILITY WEISS DEMONSTRATED BY A NUMBER OF LOCAL BALLOT MEASURES AND INITIATIVES THAT PASSED IN NOVEMBER ONE MINUTE MEETING AT. YOUR ONE MINUTE. YES SETTING UP NEW COMMUNITY CONTROLS AND OVERSIGHT THIS IS WHY THE TIME IS NOW TO CALIFORNIA BEING ACT TO ELIMINATE IMMUNITIES AND ALLOW VICTIMS OF DEADLY FORCE TO BRING CLAIMS UNDER RUMPLED ACT. SO THAT VICTIMS MAY SEEK JUSTICE IN STATE COURTS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY- NEXT THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE- CHIEF PRIDGEN.

HERE ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS WHAT CAN BE DONE. TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS OF TRUST AND NOT JUST AFTER AN INCIDENT AND I KNOW THAT'S THE FOCAL POINT. BUT QUITE FRANKLY THESE RELATIONSHIPS SHOULD EXIST BEFORE SOME TRAGEDY OCCURS. MORE SOME. INCIDENT OCCURS THAT. SHAKES THE TRUST OF THE COMMUNITY. IN ONE OF THINGS I WANT TO REALLY. FOCUS ON OR ADVISE THAT. IN LAW ENFORCEMENT WE NEED TO BE HONEST ABOUT THE ROLE WE'VE PLAYED IN THIS COUNTRY AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND HOW HISTORICALLY WE HAVE BEEN ON THE WRONG SIDE OF HISTORY AND HOW WE HAVE USED. OUR BAGGAGE AND THE LAW THE DISADVANTAGE MANY PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND THAT'S CALLED RECONCILIATION AND IT'S NOT SAYING THAT WE TODAY ARE PROBLEMATIC IN ARE TROUBLESOME AND ARE. LOOKING TO. ARM COMMUNITIES OF COLOR BUT THAT WE HAVE DONE IT IS STARKLY AND CONTEMPORARILY IT HAPPENS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS EVEN IF NOT OURS WHICH INFLUENCES THE WAY PEOPLE THINK ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THEIR- JURISDICTION SO I THINK WE NEED TO BE HONEST ABOUT THAT NOT TAKE IT PERSONALLY BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW. THE ROLE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS PLAYED IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO. BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE THE OTHER THING IS WE NEED TO BE TRANSPARENT AND I'M PROUD TO SAY THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION WAS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE WHICH ALLOWED FOR THE RELEASE OF CERTAIN INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO MISCONDUCT I KNOW THAT'S GOING TO BE A TOPIC OF DISCUSSION. THIS LEGISLATIVE CYCLE WHERE WE'RE LOOKING TO EXPAND THAT. AND THEN ALSO SB TWO THIRTY WHICH REQUIRES OFFICERS TO DE ESCALATE SITUATIONS SO THEY DON'T LEAD. TO SOMETHING TRAGIC OR SOMETHING THAT I WILL COURSE HOPE CAUSE HARM TO THE COMMUNITY. DECERTIFICATION IS ALSO TOP ON OUR LIST BECAUSE IF PEOPLE. SHOULD NOT WEAR THE BADGE IN YOUR DEPARTMENT I SHOULDN'T WEAR IT IN ANY DEPARTMENT IN STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S CERTAINLY HIGH ON OUR LIST OF THINGS WE LIKE TO COVERS. WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING TRUCKING RELATIONSHIPS WE LOOK LIKE TO LEAN ON THE PRESIDENT'S TASK FORCE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY POLICING. WHERE AT THE VERY FIRST BUILDING TRUST IN. WHICH IS IT AND WHEN YOU DO THAT. IS BY TREATING PEOPLE IN PROCEDURALLY JUST WAYS THAT MEANS YOU GIVE THEM A VOICE WE LISTEN TO WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY NOT BE JUDGMENTAL ARE YOU ALSO NEED SHOWING YOUR DECISION MAKING. YOUR TRUSTWOTHY AND FINALLY YOU TREAT EVERYBODY THAT YOU COME ACROSS NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE WHERE THEY'RE FROM WHO THEY KNOW WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. AND THEN YOU TRY TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES WHERE YOU CAN ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY AND NOT ENFORCEMENT SETS YOU'RE NOT SHOWING UP ON A CALL FOR SERVICE BUT YOU JUST OUTLINED COMMUNITY WOULD YOU STOP THE CAR AND GET OUT AND TALK TO A BUSINESS OWNER. OR SOMEBODY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD INTRODUCE YOURSELF GET TO KNOW THEM AS A HUMAN BEING. AND THAT TENDS TO. YOU TEND TO TREAT THEM DIFFERENTLY WHEN YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THEM IN THE- BUT I JUST A PERSON IN THE COMMUNITY BUT THAT'S MISTER SMITH. HE'S GOT A SON WHO GOES TO COLLEGE HE'S THE FOR FIRST CHILD IN THAT PERSON'S FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE. I THINK WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT ONE ANOTHER THE MORE LIKELY LIKELY WE ARE TO TREAT PEOPLE SKINNY ONE ANOTHER IN. A HUMANE WAYS. AND THEN WE HAVE TO. LOOK AT OURSELVES AS COMMUNITY GUARDIANS AND NOT AS- LAW ENFORCERS BUT LITERALLY PEOPLE WHO SOLVE. COMMUNITY ISSUES. AND WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO USE. THE LAW AS LEVERAGE. TO TRY TO IMPROVE SAFETY OF THE COMMUNITY. SOMETIMES IT'S- EVIDENCE OF SOMEONE TO A RESOURCE. THAT COULD GET THEM OUT OF THEIR SITUATION WHETHER IT'S- SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER WHAT IT MUST'VE VIOLENCE OR WHETHER IT'S HOMELESSNESS. AND NOT ALWAYS. LOOKING AT THE PENAL SYSTEM. AS A WAY TO REMOVE. THE WHAT WE MIGHT OR OTHERS MIGHT PERCEIVE AS- PEOPLE WHO ARE. COMMITTING CRIMES IN THE COMMUNITY. AND I WOULD SAY THE LAST THING IN THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. AND I KNOW DOCTOR PORTER MENTIONED THIS IS ACCOUNTABILITY AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU CAN SEND PEOPLE TO TRAINING YOU CAN ADVISE THEM ON HOW TO BEHAVE AND WHAT THEY SHOULD DO. WHAT THEY NEED TO BE CONSEQUENCES TO PEOPLE'S ACTIONS IT IS NOT ALWAYS CONSEQUENCES THAT YOU CAN SEE. THINGS THAT RISE TO THE LEVEL OF MEDIA ATTENTION THAT LEADS TO A DEATH IT COULD BE JUST A POLICY THAT WAS VIOLATED BUT NOBODY WOULD KNOW ABOUT OTHER THAN THE PEOPLE IN THAT DEPARTMENT. AND SO THE CHIEF IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON WHEN IT COMES TO HOW OFFICERS BEHAVE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE PART. BECAUSE OFFICERS NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT ONE DAY WILL BE REWARDED NAY WILL BE PRAISE WHEN THEY DO WHAT IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR MORES AND OUR PRINCIPLES. BUT ALSO THEY WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THEY DO NOT. AND WHETHER THAT'S SOMETHING SMALLER THAT SOMETHING LARGE THEY WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND I THINK. OUR ASSOCIATION IS MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION ONE MAKING SURE THAT WERE MORE TRANSPARENT BECAUSE I THINK THROUGH TRANSPARENCY. ACCOUNTABILITY WILL FOLLOW. AND ONCE THE COMMUNITY SEES THAT WE CAN BE TRUSTED BECAUSE WE'RE HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE. THEY'LL BE MORE LIKELY TO WORK WITH US. MORE LIKELY TO DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH US. AND MORE LIKELY TO TELL US WHEN PEOPLE COMMITTING CRIMES OF OAK WHICH ULTIMATELY. MAKE THE COMMUNITY SAFER BUT ALSO PEOPLE ARE LESS FEARFUL OF THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH THE POLICE BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE TO BE GUARDIANS. AND NOT LAW ENFORCERS. OR NOT WARRIORS. SO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME A LITTLE TIME TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU SURE GIPSON. CHIEF THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH AGAIN- THE HE IS THE INCOMING PRESIDENT THE CALIFORNIA POLICE. CHIEFS ASSOCIATION THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- WE WOULD JUST ASK IF YOU CAN JUST STAND BY WE WILL PROBABLY UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU- IN A FEW MOMENTS SO WITH THAT BEING SAID I WOULD LIKE TO BRING UP.

FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE QUALIFYING CRIME BUT THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY OTHER SOURCES OF PAYMENT HOW DO YOU SEE BEING IT PROVIDES REIMBURSEMENT OF BILLS. WE DEPARTMENT OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY STAFF AND THE MAJORITY OF THOSE ARE INVOLVED IN PROCESSING PLANTS APPERCEPTION APPLICATIONS DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY AND PAYING BILLS. OBVIOUSLY BE ALSO COMPENSATES PEOPLE BEEN WRONGFULLY CONVICTED OF A CRIME AND SPENT TIME IN PRISON WE PROVIDE GRANTS TO TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTERS ACROSS THE STATE TO HELP VICTIMS OF CRIME.

AND THE TOP THREE EXPENSES THAT WE COVERED INCLUDE MENTAL HEALTH WHERE WE PAID NEARLY EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. FUNERAL AND BURIAL COSTS MORE THAN ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AND INCOME SUPPORT WAS WAS ALSO JUST OVER ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. MUCH MORE DETAIL ABOUT OUR PROGRAM AND ALSO SUGGESTED SURVIVAL ON OUR WEBSITE. B. C. B. IS FUNDED THROUGH RESTITUTION FINES AND PENALTY ASSESSMENTS LEVIED ON PERSONS CONVICTED OF CRIMES OR TRAFFIC OFFENSES RESTITUTION ORDERS THE STATE COUNTY FONG FEDERAL GRANT FUNDS AND THE STATE GENERAL FUND.

THEREAFTER COUNTY C. B. CALIFORNIA HAS A PROUD HISTORY OF SUPPORTING ITS VICTIMS IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE CALIFORNIA CREDIT THE NATION'S FIRST VICTIM COMPENSATION PROGRAM WHICH IS TODAY COUNTY CV. ALL FIFTY STATES THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IN MANY TERRITORIES ALSO CURRENTLY HOBBIT AND COMPENSATION PROGRAMS MANY MODELED AFTER WHAT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. OUR PROGRAM IS THE MOST ROBUST IN THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF SERVICES PROVIDED TO VICTIMS AND THE MOST MOST COMPLEX INSURANCE OF ITS STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS. OBVIOUSLY HE WORKS CONTINUOUSLY TO EXPAND ITS OUTRAGE BY NETWORKING WITH DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE'S VICTIM SERVICE PROVIDERS AN AVERAGE IT'S TELLING SOCIAL WORKERS COURT OFFICIALS AMONG OTHERS. WE ARE FOCUSED ON HELPING VICTIMS OF CRIME RECOVER FROM THE PAIN AND INJURIES CAUSED BY BUT I WENT CRIME. I TELL B. C. B. WE'RE DRIVEN BY IT'S IMPORTANT AND MEANINGFUL MISSION THE EACH YEAR HELPS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS OVERCOME TRAUMATIC PERSONAL EXPERIENCES. THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR- IF WE GET YOU JUST STAND BY WE'LL HAVE QUESTIONS FROM THE PANEL- AS WELL AS MYSELF. AND WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO OUR OUR NEXT SPEAKER- WE HAVE DOCTOR BANQUETTE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE FOR OAKLAND YOU. ARE JOINING US WILL BE WITH US AND PARTICIPATING VIRTUALLY- DR A BANK HEAD ARE YOU WITH THIS. I AM HERE I'M TRYING TO START THE VIDEO. WERE BANNED TASTIC THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US IF YOU CAN PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND THEN BEGIN YOUR PRESENTATION WE WELCOME YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT WELCOME I'M VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE IT'S AN HONOR- AND I'M THERE YEAH ALL RIGHT. SO MY NAME'S TIANJIN BANKHEAD AND I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE FOR OAKLAND YOUTH- IT'S A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD NONPROFIT THAT'S LARGELY CREDITED. WITH RATIONS WITH KIND OF INFUSING RACIAL JUSTICE DIALOGUE INTO THE MODERN RESTORATIVE JUSTICE MOVEMENT- I'M ALSO A BOARD MEMBER. OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF. ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY NEAR TO MY- EXPERIENCE. AND IT'S THAT ISSUE OF HEALING LIKE TRUE AND DEEP FEELING- AFTER POLICE MISCONDUCT. SO POLICE OFFICERS AS HAS BEEN SAID EARLIER I'M NOT ABOVE THE LAW AND SO WHEN THEY ENGAGE IN HARM. THEY'RE OFTEN RACIALLY BIASED IRRESPONSIBLE AND AN UNSUBSTANTIATED VIOLENCE IS A BOLD VIOLATION OF A UNIQUELY SACRED TRUST. THAT'S ALREADY BROKEN AND BACKPACK COMMUNITIES BECAUSE OF HISTORICALLY ROOMS. SO THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE HOW DO COMMUNITIES REPAIR FROM POLICE TRAUMA WHETHER THE MISCONDUCT TAKES THE FORM OF LETHAL FORCE ABUSE OF POWER OVER POLICING OR UNCONSCIOUS RACIAL BIAS HOW TO COMMUNITIES TRULY HE L. RESTORATIVE JUSTICE OFFERS A MODEL FOR RESPONDING TO RUN DOING WHERE THE PAIN OF THESE HARMS RUNS DEEP. DIVIDING PEOPLE AND FRACTURING RELATIONSHIPS. RESTORATIVE JUSTICE OFFERS A RADICALLY DIFFERENT APPROACH IT ASKING QUESTIONS LIKE WHICH RELATIONSHIPS HAVE BEEN BROKEN AND WHAT DOES THE COMMUNITY AGREE COULD BE DONE TO HEAL. IT IS THOROUGHLY INCLUSIVE COMMUNITY DRIVEN AND GRASSROOTS IN ITS ORIENTATION. FOR EXAMPLE LET'S IMAGINE A SITUATION OF POLICE RUN GENERATE WHERE SIXTEEN YEAR OLD UNARMED BLACK BOY IS SHOT BY A POLICE OFFICER OFFICER WHO SAID HE THOUGHT THE STUDENTS PENCIL CASE WAS A GUN. FOR EXAMPLE SAKE LET'S IMAGINE THAT THE TEENAGE PERSON LET. THE COMMUNITY THE FAMILY AND THE BOY WOULD LIKELY FEEL MANY THINGS DEVALUED HOW ARE LISTS. AND DEHUMANIZED THEY ALSO FEEL HATRED RESENTMENT VENGEANCE RETRIBUTION RACIALLY TARGETED IN BETRAYED. AND THE POLICE OFFICER MIGHT FEEL ANGER. RESENTMENT FEAR SHE AND SELF RIGHTEOUSNESS. RESTORATIVE JUSTICE WOULD HAVE AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO RESOLVING THIS CONFLICT THEN I CURRENT RETRIBUTIVE SYSTEM. IN ATTEMPTING REPAIR RESTORATIVE JUSTICE WOULD SINCERELY EXPLORE HOW WE FIRST IDENTIFY THE VICTIMS AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN HARMED. HEY WE WOULD CONSIDER BOTH THE INDIVIDUALS MOST IMPACTED BY THE HARM AND THE COMMUNITY EXPERIENCING HARM. FOR DIFFERENT ALTHOUGH INTEGRATED RESPONSES. SO A RESTORATIVE JUSTICE CIRCLE MIGHT ORGANIZED WITH PEOPLE MOST INTIMATELY IMPACTED BY THE HARM AND THAT'S CAUSING. SO THIS WOULD INVOLVE BRINGING TOGETHER THE POLICE OFFICER AND THE PERSON HARMED AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AND OTHERS MUST INTIMATELY IMPACTED FOR HARM CIRCLE. AFTER SIGNIFICANT CIRCLE PREPARATION DURING THE HARM CIRCLE ALSERKAL MEMBERS WOULD ADDRESS KEY QUESTIONS AND BE ENCOURAGED TO FULLY AND DEEPLY AND AUTHENTICALLY SPEAK THEIR TRUTH. THEY WOULD TELL EACH OTHER THEIR STORY OF WHAT HAPPENED WHAT RELATIONSHIPS WERE BROKEN AS A RESULT OF THE HARMFUL ACTION AND THEY WOULD WORK TOGETHER TO DETERMINE BY CONSENSUS WHAT WAS NEEDED TO HELP THE HARM. THE OFFENDER POLICE OFFICER WOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE HARM THAT COST. THEY WOULD ATTEMPT TO MAKE AMENDS APOLOGIZE AND PROFOUNDLY COMMUNICATE A COMMITMENT TO THE BEST EXTENT POSSIBLE TO REPAIRING THE HARM. THEIR RESTITUTION REPARATIONS AND OTHER YET UNKNOWN CREATED MEANS THAT THE GROUP COULD COME TO TERMS WITH. RESTORATIVE JUSTICE IN THE SPACES IS A PROFOUNDLY MOVING AND TRANSFORMATIVE PROVOCATIVE AND SOLUTION FOCUSED PROCESS IT CAN BE REALLY LIFE CHANGING FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS. BOTH FOR THOSE WHO CAUSED THE HARM AND FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN HARMED AS IT HUMANIZES EVERYBODY IMPACTED BY THE HARM. CIRCLE MEMBERS ARE NOT SUSPECTS AND OFFICERS BUT HUMAN NEEDS PEOPLE. IN THE PROCESS PUTS THEM ALL UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL. THERE IS NO HIDING BEHIND A SHIELD A BAD OR BRAVADO. IT CAN BE A VULNERABLE HE LIED AND I OFTEN TAKE SPACE TO ENTER INTOTHAT BRINGS US ALL CLOSER TO OUR SHARED HUMANITY AS WE SET WITH. LOOK AT AND LISTEN TO THE PAIN CAUSED AND FELT BY EACH OTHER. IT ALSO CREATES AN OPENING FOR EXPRESSIONS OF REMORSE AUTHENTICITY ACCOUNTABILITY AND FORGIVENESS. CURRENTLY HOWEVER THEIR BARRIERS FOR POLICE OFFICERS WHO WANT TO ENGAGE IN THIS PROFOUNDLY TRANSFORMATIONAL PROCESS. BECAUSE THE POLICING SYSTEM IS INVESTED IN PROTECTING ITSELF THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT LAWSUITS AND COVER UPS IN PUNITIVE CULTURE SO MUCH SO THAT POLICE OFFICERS WHO ONE EKG THESE RESTORATIVE PROCESS SEES ARE DISCOURAGED OR PREVENTED FROM DOING SO BY THEIR EMPLOYERS. WELL ACTUALLY DI&lt;c.cyan&gt; IT'S OFTEN BY SARAH GET&lt;/c&gt; OFFICERS OUTSIDE OF THE PUBLIC HI BECAUSE SOME OF THAT THE OFFICERS THEMSELVES RECOGNIZE THAT ACCOUNTABILITY IS THEIR ONLY TRUE PATH. TO THEIR OWN FREEDOM AFTER CROSSING. SO FAR THE SCALE COMMUNITY HEALING AND RESTORATIVE JUSTICE COMMUNITY HEALING RESPONSE TO POLICE MISCONDUCT CAN BE ORGANIZED IN A SERIES OF COMMUNITY BUILDING CIRCLES FOLLOWING HARM. THIS IS WHERE OFTEN GRASSROOTS GROUPS OR INDIVIDUALS ORGANIZE TALKING SPACES HEALING SPACES AND PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PLACES UP FOLLOWING WHAT POLICE HARM IT HAS WIDESPREAD COMMUNITY IMPACT. IN OAKLAND WHERE OP IS CALLS ON RESTORATIVE JUSTICE LEADERS TO ORGANIZE THESE HEALING TALKING SPACES AFTER A POLICE KILLING OF AN ARMED. PERSON IN ANTICIPATION. OF COMMUNITY. SOME SORT OF TAX OFFICER OFFICE OF. TO COMMUNITY HEALING AFTER BECAUSE BY POLICE BUT NOT REPLACING HARM FOR ANOTHER HARM BUT BUYING HONEST APPROACH TO HEALING THE HARM IN OUR COURTS JUSTICE. BUT MY EXPERIENCE WITH IMPACTED FAMILIES THEY NEED THREE THINGS ACCOUNTABILITY WHICH HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT THIS MORNING ALREADY A LOT TRANSPARENCY AND A RADICAL CHANGE AND POLICE CULTURE. SO IN TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY PUBLIC FAMILIES JUST WANTED POLICE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO NAME IT AND TO CLAIM. SAID THAT SHE MOVEMENT TOWARDS WHOLENESS THERE HAS TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY BY POLICE INSTITUTIONS BOTH INDIVIDUAL OFFICERS AND POLICE AUTHORITIES NEED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY A WRONGFUL ACTION. ON THE PROBLEMS THE PROBLEMS OF POLICE ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS AND STOP BLAMING THE FAMILIES AND VICTIMS THAT ARE MOST HARMED. HE STARTED CAN YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE. OKAY VIRTUALLY TO HAPPEN IMPACT PEOPLE. THEY NEED TO SEE TRANS. I'M SIX AND THEY WANT THE CANDIDATES AROUND ELEVEN OF IMPLICIT BY. IN FAMILIES ALSO WANT TRANSPARENCY TRANSPARENCY IN POLICE DEPARTMENTS IN THOSE STRUCTURES AROUND HIM FORM SYSTEMS THAT SEEKS IMPENETRABLE BY OUTSIDERS. AND THEY WANT A RADICAL CHANGE IN REFORM TO POLICE AFTER POLICE HEALTHCARE IS SEEN TO BE ROPED- AND- PEOPLE IMPACTED ONE THESE KIDS TO END THEIR CODE OF SILENCE THAT SEEMS TO ONLY PROTECT FINANCIAL INTERESTS AND THE OLD BOYS NETWORK. SO LASTLY I GUESS I'LL SAY THAT THERE IS A DIRE NEED FOR THIS UPSTREAM RADICAL POLICE CULTURE REFORM. SOME MIGHT SAY THE BEDROCK OF POLICING IN THE UNITED STATES IS ROOTED AND ABUSE OF POWER AND FLAGRANT DISREGARD FOR THE% VALUE OF HUMAN LIVES THAT RESIDE IN BLACK AND BROWN BODIES AND THE BODIES OF OTHER UNDER REPRESENTED PERSONS. I'M HAS TRULY. FOR US TO REVAMP OUR POLICE INSTITUTIONAL PRACTICES TO EMBRACE AN AUTHENTICALLY HEALING JUSTICE WHERE ACCOUNTABILITY FAIRNESS AND DIGNITY RULE AND WHERE THE VOICE OF HUMANITY OF EVERY HUMAN BEING IS VALUED. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- DOCTOR BANKER WE APPRECIATE YOU IF YOU COULD JUST STAND BY WE WANT TO- WILL BE GOING TO SOME QUESTIONS- IN A FEW MOMENTS SIX. OKAY THE FIRST QUESTION- I'M GOING TO ASK- THIS- BECAUSE LINDA- WHAT CRIED WHAT CRIMES ARE COVERED BY THE COW- THE- AND HOW HAS THEY CHANGED OVER THE TIMES OVER TIME. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION MISTER CHAIR- WHEN CALVIN CLV WAS ESTABLISHED IN IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE THE PROGRAM ONLY COVER DRUG VICTIMS OF VIOLENT CRIME THE CAUSE PHYSICAL INJURY AND SO PHYSICAL ASSAULTS AND HOMICIDES AND WERE WHAT WE WERE COVERED- BUT OVER THE PAST FIFTY SIX YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAS EXPANDED THE QUALIFYING CRIMES THAT ARE COVERED BY KELSEY VCP- AND ESPECIALLY IN THE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES THIS WAS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT. VEHICULAR CRIMES- AND THE MOST RECENT ADDITIONS INCLUDE HUMAN TRAFFICKING STOCKING AND DISTRIBUTION OF CHILD **** SO- AMONG THE CRIMES WE COMMIT- COVERS ALL CHILD ABUSE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DRUG DRIVING AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING ONLINE HARASSMENT ROBBERY A CENTRAL ASSAULT AND STALKING. TERRORISM AND YOU CATCH WHAT MANSLAUGHTER ALL CRIMES AND THAT HOW DOES JUST OR INJURY OR THREAT OF PHYSICAL INJURY OR IN SOME CASES- SUCH AS ONLINE HARASSMENT WHICH MENTAL HARM THAT HAS BEEN CAUSED. BY THE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF UP FOR YOU- HOW DO VICTIMS OF VIOLENT CRIME APPLY- AND HOW TO GET COMPENSATION FOR MY ORGANIZATION CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH THAT PROCESS. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- THAT DEMONSTRATE APPLY DIRECTLY ONLINE AT CHAO B. C. B. OR THROUGH A PAPER APPLICATION- BUT MANY ALSO. HELPED IT THROUGH- I DID JUST WITNESS AT ASSISTANCE CENTER LISTED LOCATED IN MANY COUNTIES AND MANY PARTICIPATE AND ARE IN DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICES ON MANY COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THOSE ASSISTING- SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND CAN HELP VICTIMS- WITH- I'M FILLING OUT AN APPLICATION WE ALSO PROVIDE- ARE BENT OUT RECHARGE TO BLOCK MEMBERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT THEY CAN ALSO CANDID THAT JOBS TO HELP THEM RECEIVE INFORMATION ON HOW TO APPLY. AND WE HAVE AN ONLINE RESOURCES AND ONE EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER THE VICTIMS ARE ABLE TO COLLEGE RECEIVED HELP. WHEN THEY SUBMIT AN APPLICATION- NECESSARY DOCUMENTATION INCLUDING OUR PRIME REPORT ON STUFF VERIFIES THE INFORMATION- AND THEY TRY TO GATHER ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO VERIFY THE CRIME- AND THEN ONCE THE APPLICATION IS APPROVED- THEN WE WOULD START RECEIVING BILLS AND REMEMBERED START REIMBURSING FOR BELTS- WE- AVERAGE ABOUT SAID. FIVE DAYS- FOR APPROVING AT APPLET IN THE FISCAL YEAR- WE- MAKE PAYMENTS DIRECTLY TO- THAT SO EITHER YOU'RE A MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER OR A PHYSICIAN OR HOSPITAL OR FUNERAL BURIAL. HOME AND WE WE'VE HELP WE PROVIDE THAT- PAYMENT DIRECTLY TO THE PROVIDERS- SO THE VICTIMS- DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THOSE COSTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ONE POLOKWANE FOLLOW QUESTION- VICTIMS OF POLICE MISCONDUCT ARE THEY INCLUDED AS WELL. THERE'S CURRENT IF- IF THERE'S A CRIME REPORT AND THAT'S FINE- THE VERIFICATION OF A CRIME THAT'S OCCURRED- THEY WOULD BE INCLUDED UNDER CURRENT STATUTES SO THERE'S ALSO PENDING LEGISLATION- ON THAT MATTER RIGHT NOW IN THE LEGISLATURE SO I'LL- DEFER TO. THAT POLICY PROCESS THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CHIEF ARE YOU STILL WITH US I HAVE A QUESTION FOR IT FOR YOU. FROM A POLICE OFFICER- YEAH FROM A POLICE OFFICER OR HIS OR HER DEPARTMENT STANDPOINT. WHAT ARE THE METHODS WHICH LAW ENFORCEMENT USED TO REPAIR. THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH COMMUNITY AFTER. THEY COMMIT- SOME MISCONDUCT- HOW IMPORTANT IS IT. THAT THE OFFICER OF THEIR OF THAT TO THAT DEPARTMENT- MEMORY PHRASE THAT. WINOGRAD OFFICER IS ACCUSED OF MISCONDUCT HOW IS THE DATA DRASTIC NâNG WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT BUT ALSO IN THE COMMUNITY AS WELL. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION MISTER CHAIR I THINK. IT'S SO VITALLY IMPORTANT AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT DEPARTMENTS ONE OPERA OPERATING PROCEDURE WE JUST LEASE AND THAT IS. GIVING A VOICE TO THE COMMUNITY SO PART OF THAT IS LISTENING TO THE COMMUNITY'S CONCERNS AND BEING RESPONSIVE. AND LISTENING ACTIVELY ABOUT WHAT THE COMMUNITY BELIEVES NEED THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN WILL IMPORT TO PREVENT SOMETHING LIKE THAT FROM OCCURRING. NOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA UNLESS SOMETHING BECOMES. PUBLIC FODDER FOR EXAMPLE IF IT MAKES IT INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN. INFORMATION CANNOT BE RELEASED ON INVESTIGATIONS WITHIN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT'S SOMETHING WE HOPE TO CHANGE MOVING FORWARD BECAUSE AGAIN THAT. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. SORT OF INHIBITS OUR ABILITY. TO SHOW THAT WE ARE HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE AND TO BUILD TRUST. SO RIGHT NOW UNLESS IT'S IN THE YEAR THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO IS COMMUNICATE WITH THE PERSON WHO LIVES THE COMPLAINT TO GIVE THEM THE RESULTS OF THE COMPLAINT. WELL LET'S SAY SOMETHING DID GO PUBLIC I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE AGENCY TO BE IN A COMMUNITY TALKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED BEING HONEST AND FORTHRIGHT AND IF WE MAKE MISTAKES. LET'S OWN UP TO WHAT I KNOW I HEARD THAT THE DOCTOR MENTIONED THE CONCERNED ABOUT LAWSUITS AND THERE ARE. PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED WITH THAT BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT IS BUILDING TRUST. AND NOT NECESSARILY SAVING A COUPLE OF DOLLARS ON THE BACK IN. THE COMMUNITIES CONSTRUCTIVE SO I BELIEVE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO BE TRANSPARENT. AND TO BE ACCOUNTABLE AND TO LISTEN ACTIVELY TO WHAT THE COMMUNITY IS SAYING AND RESPOND TO THOSE REQUESTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHIEF OF FOR RESPONDING TO THAT QUESTION. WANT TO GO TO MISS- BANQUETTE- WITH RESPECT TO WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE DOING- TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS WHOLE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE KIND OF. OF SPACE. CAN YOU NAME A THREE POINTS THAT YOU LIKE TO. SHARE WITH US. THAT YOU THINK THROUGH YOUR WORK OBJECT IT WILL BE VERY USEFUL FOR US TO CONSIDER. AS WE DO THIS WORK IN TERMS OF REFORMING A REIMAGINE WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT EXPECTING IN THIS STATE. YES THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- THE BIG QUESTION I WOULD SAY NUMBER ONE AND A FOCUS ON RESTORATIVE POLICING THERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES WORLDWIDE IN THE CITY OF HULL ENGLAND FOR EXAMPLE IT'S A RESTORATIVE CITY IT USES RESTORATIVE APPROACHES IN POLICING SO NOT. IS TO INFUSE THESE PRACTICES AND PRINCIPLES BUT TO REALLY MAKE ORGANIZED THE SYSTEMS THEMSELVES- TO FOCUS MORE ON RELATIONSHIPS AND DIALOGUE AND RESOLVING WRONGDOING NOT ONLY FOCUSED ON CRIME SO THERE'S A THERE'S A COMPLETE KIND OF RE ORIENTATION IN POLICING AND I WOULD ARGUE FOR- AND I THINK MOST RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PRACTITIONERS WOULD TOO SO THAT'S A BIG THING WHICH DEALS WITH- THAT KIND OF% INFRASTRUCTURE WITHIN OUR POLICE SEEMED KIND OF SYSTEMS THEMSELVES. YES AND THAT'S ONE AND IT'S A NUMBER TWO- WOULD BE TO SINCE TWO I AGREE WITH WHAT'S BEEN SAID ABOUT TRAINING LIKE YOU CAN'T TRAIN RACISM OUT OF PEOPLE BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO GIVE- POLICE OFFICER IS A KIND OF AN ORIENTATION THAT SPEAKS TO THE HEART OF THAT IMPLICIT BIAS DOESN'T HAPPEN SO THAT IT IS ELIMINATED IN A DEEP WAY AND SO FOR THAT TO HAPPEN YOU CAN'T JUST TEACH PEOPLE AND TRY TO SPEAK TO THE HEAD AND TRY TO INTELLECTUALLY. GET THEM TO NOT WE HAVE A REFLEX THAT IS NOT LARGELY UNCONSCIOUS IN IN A MOMENT WHERE HARM OCCURS SO IT'S MORE THAN JUST TRADING IT IS. AN EXPERIENCE REALLY THAT IS RESTRUCTURING A LIFETIME OF YOU KNOW TAKING AND A WHITE SUPREMACIST KIND OF A CULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT SO JUST BEING REALLY. SERIOUS AND SINCERE ABOUT. I DON'T WANT THE TREE BUT UP ABOUT RE. THE OF THE CALL- POLICING BASICALLY BOTH HOW POLICE UP. ENGAGE THOSE ACTIVITIES HOW THIS HOW THE THAT IT POLICE INSTITUTIONS- OUR BRAVE. MEN IT'S- AN ORGAN AND THEN WHAT THEIR EXPECTATIONS ARE OF THEM. YES I RACES- YOU KNOW KIND OF EITHER AND APPROACH SO I WOULD SAY THOSE TWO THINGS IN THE LAST JUST OPENING UP THE WAYS IN WHICH- IS OFTEN. THIRD AND A COMMUNITY CAN'T INTERACT SO CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THIS NEW DEEP INTO HEALING SO YES PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HARM TO COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN HARMED THAT HAVE BEEN HARMED WANT- ACCOUNTABILITY AND WHAT'S THAT ACCOUNTABILITY LOOKS LIKE IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT AN OVERSIGHT BOARD. ART I TELL YOU WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO INDIVIDUALS TO OUR ARMED AND COMMUNITIES. AND KIND OF. IN TERMS OF THE POLICE. RESPECT AND THE- AND THE COMMUNITY NETWORK DINNER ALSO. CONSENT EXISTENCE IS DONE THE- FOR THAT. BUT TO KIND OF GO OVER THE OUTSIDE THIS IS BUT THAT'S HOW TO COMPLETE ACT HAPPY SO MANY OF THESE OTHER RESPONSE ARE YOU KNOW BAND ON A GUNSHOT WOUND AND THAT THE PAIN GETS CARRIED BY OF THE COMMUNITY AND THE POLICE OFFICER AND THE POLICE INSTITUTION TO JUST CREATE BIGGER BARRIERS AND MORE DIVISIONS SO- I WOULD JUST SAY HAVING ANOTHER OPERATOR HAVING MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR DEEP RESTORATIVE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN POLICE POLICE OFFICERS AND POLICE INSTITUTIONS. AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THANK YOU FOR THAT I WANT TO GO TO THE I WANT TO GO TO THE- TO OUR CHIEF AND THEN AFTER WHICH I WANT TO ASK MISS YOU A QUESTION SO HOPEFULLY SHE'S STILL STANDING BY. CHIEF WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE DOING THAT WE'RE NOT DOING BY WAY OF POLICY. TO TRY TO ADDRESSSOME OF THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES THAT EXIST BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE COMMUNITIES SO AS A MAN OF COLOR IN LEADERSHIP IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. WHAT FROM YOUR LANDS AND SPACE DID YOU DO YOU THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING TO TRY TO BRIDGE THE GAP- ADDRESS ISSUES THAT ARE NOT BEING ADDRESSED- SO THAT THE COMMUNITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN WORK. COHESIVELY. LEAST DEVELOP A BETTER RELATIONSHIP. SHARE GIPSON THAT IS. A VERY VERY QUICKLY AND WHAT I WILL SAY BEFORE I GIVE YOU MY RESPONSE IS WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THESE ISSUES WITH POLICING COMMUNITY HE'S- IT IS JUST A SYMPTOM OF WHAT IS OCCURRING IT IN EVERY SITUATION IN OUR COUNTRY. RIGHT WE ARE THE FACE OF GOVERNMENT AND SO THE THINGS THAT CAN MOST GO WRONG TYPICALLY HAPPEN WHEN THOSE INTERACTIONS TAKE PLACE BECAUSE WE'RE ON THE COMMUNITIES BUT EVERY SYSTEM. IN THE UNITED STATES DISADVANTAGES PEOPLE OF COLOR. WE HAVE TO DO IS GO BACK AND LOOK ON A REPORT FROM THE NINETEEN SIXTIES AND SOME OF THE SAME THINGS THAT WERE MENTIONED IN THAT REPORT. EXIST TODAY. BUT IF YOU WERE TO ASK. AND YOU DID WHAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD DO I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS DOING IS. TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT. DEPARTMENTS ARE MORE TRANSPARENT. BUT I THINK REALLY THE MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION AND I'VE SAID THIS TO SOMEONE COLLEAGUES. IS HOW DO YOU HOLD CHIEF. CHIEF OF POLICE ACCOUNTABLE. BECAUSE THAT'S TO CHANGE THE CULTURE. AT THE END OF THE DAY. YOU CAN HAVE POLICIES YOU CAN HAVE. LAWS ON THE BOOKS YOU CAN HAVE TRAINING BUT ULTIMATELY THE CHIEF. CHANGES THE CULTURE SO HOW DO YOU HOLD YOUR CHIEFS OF POLICE ACCOUNTABLE. THAT IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I THINK NEEDS TO BE DONE IF YOU TRULY WANT SYSTEMIC CHANGE AT. ALL LEVELS. IN ADDITION TO SOME OF THE THINGS HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED BECAUSE I THINK THERE IS VALUE WILL BRING THINGS TO PEOPLE'S ATTENTION GIVEN THEM AN OPPORTUNITY. TO RECOGNIZE. SOME OF THE BLIND SPOTS. AND THEN. CREATE INTERVENTION SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE AS MANY. AND THEY DON'T IMPACT THE WAY THEY TREAT PEOPLE BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THE CHIEF. OF POLICE CHANGE THE CULTURE IN AN ORGANIZATION WHICH- INFORMED HOW OFFICERS TREAT PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY. AND HOW DO WE DO THAT THAT'S THE QUESTION. THANK YOU ALSO FOLLOW QUESTION I'VE HEARD AND I DARE NOT MENTION NAMES BUT I'VE HEARD FROM POLICE CHIEFS THAT THEIR HANDS ARE ARE ALMOST TAG IN TERMS OF DEALING WITH A BAD APPLE THAT MAY EXIST IN A DEPARTMENT- DO YOU SHARE- THAT SAME FEELING AND OR IF THERE'S ANY SUGGESTIONS YOU CAN GIVE. US THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT MOVING FORWARD. VERY GOOD QUESTIONS ALSO THIS I'VE GOT THE UNIQUE EXPERIENCE OF HAVING WORKED IN ANOTHER STATE THAT HAVE HAD- HAVING COME TO CALIFORNIA. AND I'VE BEEN AN EXECUTIVE FOR. ONE THIRD OF MY CAREER SO ABOUT TWELVE YEARS I'VE BEEN AT EITHER NUMBER TWO IN A LARGE AGENCY. AND HERE IS THE CHIEF. AND A SMALLER AGENCY. MY HANDS ARE TIED NOW I CAN UNDERSTAND FROM THE STANDPOINT THEY FEEL IF SOMETHING GOES TO ARBITRATION AND THE DECISION THEY'VE MADE MAYBE GETS OVERTURNED AND ARE IN ARBITRATION THAT'S A SEPARATE ISSUE I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT CAN BE FRUSTRATING. AND I SEE THAT AS AN IMPEDIMENT BUT AT THE SAME TIME OFFICERS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'VE GOT AN AVENUE. TO ADDRESS. ISSUES THAT THEY FEEL MAYBE THEY WEREN'T BEING TREATED FAIRLY IN. BUT MY HANDS ARE TIED IF I WANT TO TAKE A PARTICULAR ACTION BECAUSE I BELIEVE VIOLATES POLICY OR BELIEVE IT VIOLATES. THE PHILOSOPHICAL APPROACH AND I THINK OUR OFFICERS SHOULD BE EMBODYING. I CAN HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE MY HANDS ARE TIED. NOW I NEED TO MAKE SURE I HAVE A STRONG ENOUGH CASE SO THAT THE LIKELIHOOD OF GETTING OVERTURNED IS REDUCED BUT THE FACT IS NONE OF US HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL AND YOU CAN HAVE THE STRONGEST CASE IN THE WORLD AND I CAN STLL GET OVER HER. MY HANDS ARE TIED SO I WOULD BE CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT THOSE EXAMPLES ARE BECAUSE MY HANDS WERE TIED WHEN I WAS IN TEXAS NOT. TIED HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT. I WANT TO GO TO- MISS YOU- IF YOU'RE STILL WITH US. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO WE MAY HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION I DON'T KNOW BUT PLEASE STAND BY I MISS YOU I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU- WHAT DO YOU THINK THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON AS IT RELATES TO RE IMAGINING AND I USE THE WORD- REIMAGINE ALSO REFORM INTERCHANGEABLY BUT WE'RE GOING TO REIMAGINE WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT LOOKS LIKE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO WITH THAT BEING SAID WHAT ARE SOME OF WHAT CAN YOU GIVE ME THREE- PARTICULAR AREAS THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON TO TRY TO HELP AND REIMAGINE WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT LOOKS LIKE IN THIS STATE. FROM YOUR LANDS. SURE SO THERE HAS BEEN A THEME HERE TODAY IT'S REALLY ABOUT TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THESE REFORMS YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF ISSUES. ONE I EASE IN SB TWO ONE TWO IN FRONT. OF ONE OF THE WITH ISSUES. IT HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH DECERTIFICATION WE ARE NOW ONLY ONE OF FOUR STATES THAT DO NOT HAVE A PROCESS. IN DEALING WITH POLICE OFFICERS WHO BREAK THE LAW. SO IT REALLY IS UNACCEPTABLE BUT ALL THESE OTHER STATES HAVE A WAY TO DEAL WITH THEIR OFFICERS AND TREAT THEM AS PROFESSIONALS THAT THEY ARE. BUT WE DO NOT SO THAT REALLY IS ONE WAY TO MAKE. IT TRANSPARENT. AND YOU HAVE- ACCOUNTABILITY BY THE OFFICERS. THE SECOND ISSUE AS WE TALKED ABOUT ARE THESE IMMUNITIES THE WAY THAT WE TREAT THE VICTIMS. OF POLICE VIOLENCE SO DIFFERENTLY. THAN WE DO THE OFFICERS THEMSELVES. IS UNSPEAKABLE AND EXPAND THE CLEAR MESSAGE AGAIN AND AGAIN TO EVERYBODY WITHIN THE STATE. THAT SOME PEOPLE DESERVE TO BE TREATED BETTER SOME PEOPLE GET SPECIAL TREATMENT FROM THE JUDGES. OUT FROM THEIR OWN DEPARTMENTS FROM THE POPULAR. CHILDHOOD VICTIMS HAVE NOWHERE TO GO NO ONE TO TALK TO YOU. I SO I THINK IT'S REALLY CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT IN LOOKING AT SB TOOTH THAT BOTH PROVISIONS. AND ARE LOOKED AT VERY CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THE REPRESENT WIDE ACCOUNTABILITY AND. TRANSPARENCY CAN LEAD TO. THANK YOU WERE COMPLETE. YES OKAY CORRECT THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR THAT HI I HEAR YOU KNOW A COMMON THEME IN TERMS OF A TRANSPARENCY AND I THINK THAT. WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM BOTH SIDES PEOPLE WANT TO BE TRANSPARENT IN THIS PARTICULAR PROCESS AND SO WE CERTAINLY BELIEVE THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT AND WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE SOME OF THE PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT ARE MOVING THROUGH THE LESS THAT PROCESS RIGHT NOW THAT SPEAKS TO A MORE TRANSPARENT- PROCESS MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT BEING SAID- ONE **** ON MY COLLEAGUES HE HAS ANY COMMENTS OR REMARKS TO MAKE OKAY. WE HAVE NO CAR I DON'T ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THE LINE I MISS THE STYLUS OR ANYONE THAT HAS ANY COMMENTS BEFORE WE MOVED TO OUR PUBLIC COMMENT SECTION. IN A CELL PLEASE FREE TO- JUST CHIME RIGHT ON IN. OKAY HEARING AND SAYING NO ONE IN THE QUEUE I WANT TO AGAIN EXPRESS MY DEEPEST GRATITUDE AND THANKS TO- THE- THE OUR PANELISTS FOR COMING OUT AND FOR BEING PART OF THIS DIALOGUE- HOW DO WE- DO THE WORK WE WERE TRYING OUR BEST. AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR SPEAKER ANTHONY RENDON FOR GIVING US THE SPACE TO HAVE THIS OPEN DIALOGUE- AS I INDICATED WE'VE DONE A NUMBER OF HEARINGS- HAVE HAD GREAT TESTIMONIES ON BOTH SIDES WE TRY NOT TO LEAVE ANY VOICES OUT OF THIS PROCESS- WE HOPE THAT WE'LL HAVE MAYBE ANOTHER ONE OR OUR- COUPLE MORE AS WE MOVE THROUGH THIS PROCESS. BUT THIS TIME THIS IS THE PUBLIC COMMENT SECTION- WE WOULD ASK AGAIN MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC- ONE TO LIMIT YOUR REMARKS TO TWO MINUTES. THERE IS A MICROPHONE- THIS BEHIND THE PLEXIGLAS WE ASK THAT YOU APPROACH- THAT MICROPHONE YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES OF PLEASE WE ASK THAT YOU DO NOT TOUCH THE MICROPHONE IF YOU SERGEANTS WILL IN FACT MAKE THE ADJUSTMENT ON THE MICROPHONE. SO AT THIS TIME WE WILL INVITE ANYONE OF THE PUBLIC AN OPPORTUNITY WILL TAKE THOSE IN THE AUDIENCE FIRST AND THEN WE'LL MOVE TO THOSE. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE WAITING ON LINE- FIRST. SO WITH THAT BEING SAID ANYONE REMEMBER THE PUBLIC WISHING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC. TESTIMONY IF YOU WOULD PLEASE. APPROACH TO THE MICROPHONE BEHIND THE PLEXIGLAS. AND YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES BUT YOUR REMARKS AND WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR A HEARING TO THE RULES OF DECORUM- THAT OUTLINED REGARDING- SOCIAL AND PHYSICAL DISTANCING- AND ONE PERSON IN THE ELEVATOR SO WITH THAT BEING SAID IF YOU COULD PLEASE TATE YOUR NAME. AND THEN PROCEED WITH YOUR COMMENTS. HELLO MY NAME IS JACK SHELLS AND- SO I KIND OF WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT- I HAVE BEEN USING THIS YEAR'S AMOUNT PLEASE- WE'RE WE'RE HAVING SOME DISTURBANCE UP IN THE BALCONY. WOULD YOU PLEASE- CONDUCT YOURSELF TO THE RULES OF THE DECORUM. MA'AM IF YOU CAN PLEASE AGAIN- PLEASE QUIET DOWN- SOMEONE IS GIVING PUBLIC TESTIMONY AND YOU CAN'T DO THAT THEN I WOULD HAVE TO BE FORCED ASKS I WANT TO START JUST A SCORCHER OUT. I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. PLEASE BEGAN START ALL OVER. STATE YOUR NAME THANK YOU MY NAME IS JACK SHELLS. AND I HAVE BEEN ON BOTH ENDS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE ENDING A BIT NEGATIVE AND- AND I KNOW WITH THE COMMUNITY. WE DO A LOT OF- WELL THERE'S A POLICE ACTIVITY LEAGUE. YOU IT THERE'S LIKE DIFFERENT RANKS FOR ARE. FOR OUR CHILDREN TO BE INVOLVED WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT TO KNOW THEM MORE TO KNOW BETTER THE RELATIONSHIPS. AND THIS SEEMS TO REALLY HELP WITH MY TOWN I'M FROM CITRUS HEIGHTS. AND THE SMALLER I GUESS THE SMALLER THE TOWN IS. THE MORE OPPORTUNITIES YOU HAVE TO KNOW LAW ENFORCEMENT- IS SO THAT'S KIND OF THE THING THAT I THINK. WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE WITH- SACRAMENTO. IS MORE OF THE COMMUNITY TO REACH OUT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS AND START KNOWING MORE OF THE LAWS. AND ALSO I KNOW THAT- THERE ARE FEW OFFICERS WHO DO HAVE CONSEQUENCES. OF THEIR ACTIONS IT'S JUST. NOT POSTED UP ON SOCIAL MEDIA. I SO THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT I WANTED TO SAY AND I KNOW WITH MY EXPERIENCE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT BACK IN STOCKTON. I HAVE- BEEN ARRESTED BEFORE AND I DID ADMIT MY CRIME. AND I WAS RELEASED AND THAT CASE IS CLOSED I MOVED HERE IN SACRAMENTO. NEW LIFE NEW FRESH START AND- I DO RESPECT LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND BUT I THINK HAVING CERTAIN PROGRAMS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT TO REACH OUT TO THE COMMUNITY REALLY DOES HELP- SO THE COMMUNITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT TO HAVE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND START KNOWING EACH OTHER BETTER. AND IF YOU HAVE AN ISSUE WITH WHATEVER YOU CAN GO TO A CERTAIN OFFICER TALK AND THEN THEY'LL TELL YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO DO. AND SO THAT'S THAT'S BASICALLY ALL I WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMMENTS WE APPRECIATE THAT- THANK YOU FOR SHARING. YOUR THOUGHTS WITH US- AGAIN THIS IS THE TIME FOR THE PUBLIC- COMMENT WE WOULD SIMPLY ASK THAT YOU PLEASE APPROACH THE MICROPHONE IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. PLEASE REFER. STATE YOUR NAME FOR WHICH OUR COMMENTS- WE'RE DOING WELL WHAT TIMES ARE BEING A LITTLE BIT LIBERAL WITH TIME WITHOUT PUBLIC COMMENT SECTION SO SIR PLEASE. FEEL FREE. TO APPROACH THE MICROPHONE AT THE NEEDED ADJUSTED WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO ADJUST IT FOR YOU. SEEMS A LITTLE BIT LOW OKAY ONE MOMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY NAME IS TIMOTHY WEEKS AND- SEVERAL MONTHS AGO I WAS AT A RALLY IN DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO AND- THE FOOD THERE WAS A POLICE. PRESENCE THERE THAT- WERE ON BICYCLES RIGHT NEXT TO THE CAPITOL BUILDING. AND WE NOTICED THERE WAS A PARADE OF ANTIFA MARCHERS THAT WERE MARCHING DOWN IN ST AND WE HAD PARKED OUR VEHICLE IN IN ST UNFORTUNATELY AND WE HEARD THIS CROWD THE ANTIFA MARCHERS WERE BASHING IN CAR WINDOWS AND TEARING OFF- SIDE MIRRORS AND SLASHING TIRES AND AS THEY STARTED TO APPROACH THE POLICE WORK MAINTAINING QUITE A DISTANCE FROM THESE MARCHERS AND THEY TOLD US THAT WE SHOULD NOT PASS BY THE POLICE OTHERWISE THEY CANNOT GUARANTEE OUR SAFETY. AND I SAID WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY DESTROY MY VEHICLE- AND THEY SAID WELL IF WE SEE IT WE CAN ARREST THEM BUT THEY WERE BASICALLY WAITING A WHOLE BLOCK BEHIND THE MARCHERS SO THERE WAS NO WAY FOR THEM TO SEE- ANY KIND OF VANDALISM AGAINST VEHICLES. AND IT BOTHERED ME THAT. I FELT SOMEWHAT UNPROTECTED BY OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT AND I HAVE A FEELING IT'S BECAUSE THEY WERE. TOLD TO STAND DOWN. AGAINST THESE- MARCHERS- AND IT BOTHERS ME THAT I FEEL LIKE ARE THE HANDS OF THE POLICE ARE TIED IN MANY WAYS- I FELT UNSAFE I ONLY FELT SAFE WHEN I WAS STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO THE POLICE OFFICERS. IT IT BOTHERED ME THAT THEY HAD TO WAIT I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY WAITED BUT THEY WAITED A WHOLE BLOCK BEHIND THE MARCHERS SO WHEN WE WENT TO OUR CAR TO DETER DETERMINE. SKEWS ME TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT OUR VEHICLE HAD BEEN VANDALIZED OURS WAS NOT BUT THREE OTHER VEHICLES RIGHT NEAR OUR VEHICLES WERE. SMASHED AND PEOPLE WERE STANDING AT THEIR VEHICLES CRYING WATCHING LOOKING AT THEIR DAMAGED VEHICLES AND- IT BOTHERED ME THAT. THAT THE POLICE OFFICERS WOULD ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN- TWO VEHICLES THEY MIGHT OF PROTECTED HIM THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES BUT THEIR VEHICLES WERE AND PROTECTED AND I FELT LIKE. OUR POLICEMEN ARE IN WOMEN ARE THEIR HANDS ARE TIED. IN DOING THEIR JOBS AND I FEEL LIKE. THERE IS THE THEY HAVE TO DANCE AROUND ALL THESE LITTLE RULES AND EVERYTHING TO TRY TO NOT- UPSET PEOPLE AND- IT'S- IT'S LIKE THEY CAN'T EVEN DO THEIR JOBS WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT EVERY SINGLE LITTLE THING THEY DO I CANNOT A MAN OF THE MATCH IN THE MENA STRESSED THAT THEY- HAVE TO DEAL WITH EVERY DAY IN THEIR IN THEIR JOBS. AND STILL THEY HAVE TO BE SO CAREFUL THAT THEY DON'T. MAKE A LITTLE MISTAKE AND OFFEND SOMEONE AND HURT SOMEONE- IT AND SOME PEOPLE THEY THEY RESIST ARREST INSTEAD INSTEAD OF JUST COOPERATING WITH THE POLICE THEY RESIST AND THAT. THAT JUST EXACERBATES THE PROBLEM AND I FEEL LIKE IF PEOPLE JUST OBEY WHAT THE POLICEMAN SAYS OUR POLICE WOMAN SAYS AND GO ALONG WITH THEM YOU'LL HAVE YOUR DAY IN COURT IF THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING WRONG BUT IF YOU RESIST THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE LIKELY. TO BE- TO BE BRUTALIZED IF YOU WILL BECAUSE IT'S LIKE. IT'S SOMETHING WITH ANY HUMAN BEING THAT IF YOU IF YOU FIGHT THEM. THEY'RE GONNA FIGHT BACK AND I FEEL LIKE. A LOT OF TIMES THESE VICTIMS DAVE THEY RESIST ARREST OR THEY RESIST THE POLICE OFFICER INSTEAD OF JUST. A THE BILL OBEYING THEM IN A SENSE IF SOMEONE IF A POLICE OFFICER TO COME TO ME AND I'M AS WHITE AS WHITE COULD BE. I GET THAT I CAN NEVER UNDERSTAND HOW IT'S GOING TO BE FOR A PERSON OF COLOR. BUT IF A POLICE OFFICER ASKED ME TO DO SOMETHING I WOULD OBEY THEM I WOULD NOT RESIST THEM BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE STE JUST BE FOOLISHNESS NO MATTER WHAT COLOR WHAT SHADE OF SKIN YOU ARE YOU JUST DON'T RESIST THEM BECAUSE THERE'S NO PURPOSE IN THAT. YOU OBEY THEM AND YOU DO WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BECAUSE THEY ARE AN AUTHORITY AND THEY HAVE A VERY STRESSFUL JOB AND WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THERE'S COMPLETE STRESS ALL THE TIME ON THEM THIRTY SECONDS. AND I'M FINISHED THANK YOU KNOW THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY- I UNDERSTAND THERE'S ANOTHER- MEMBER THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK- WE WOULD ASK THAT YOU PLEASE APPROACH THE MICROPHONE- PLEASE DON'T TOUCH THE MICROPHONE. MAKE THE ADJUSTMENT- WE'RE GOING TO GO TO OUR VIDEO- STATION OUTSIDE IN SERVICE PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND IN PER SE WHICH ARE COMMON. CAN YOU HEAR ME. JULIA STILES YES YEAH PLEASE PROCEED YEAH THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SPEAK TODAY THANK YOU LET ME SPEAK TODAY- WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT AB SIX IS FIVE IS THAT I LEARNED THAT IT'S TO FIND POTENTIAL HATE GROUPS WITHIN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND I THINK THIS BILL. THE LIST WHERE I WRITE IS VERY SLIPPERY SLOPE BECAUSE YOU WANT TO. VOTE OUT THE HATE GROUP OF THOSE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED THE HATE GROUP BUT THE QUESTION COMES DOWN TO WHO WITH THE HATE GROUP IN WHAT IS A HATE GROUP. AND WHEN YOU LABEL THINGS SPECIAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS WEISS A PER ME SI OVER INTO VICE DIPLOMACY WORLD THINGS VERY DANGEROUS VISUAL LABEL AND EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. A SUPREME IS BASED ON COLOR SKIN AND BY DEFINITION THAT WOULD BE RACES. SO I THINK THIS BILL IS A VERY SLIPPERY SLOPE BECAUSE IT TARGETS A CERTAIN PEOPLE EVEN THOUGH IT'S SAID TO BE CLAIM THAT IT'S NOT IT REALLY IS TARGETING A GROUP OF PEOPLE BECAUSE WHO BECOMES A HATE GROUP CHRISTIANS. PRO LIFERS ANYBODY THT HAS A RELIGION THAT GOES AGAINST THE NARRATIVE. WHO DO WE START DEMAND WHO'S I HATE GROUP AND WHO'S NOT. SO I THINK THIS IS A VERY SLIPPERY SLOPE I THINK. YOU SHOULD REALLY TINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH THIS BILL. COULD YOU CAN BE POTENTIALLY TARGETING PEOPLE. AND THAT CREATES MORE DIVISION THAN IN DIS UNITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMMENT WE APPRECIATE WE APPRECIATE YOUR INPUT- NEXT IS THERE ANOTHER AN AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO SPEAK PLEASE APPROACH THE MICROPHONE. AND PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME YES MA'AM.

I WE HAVE MILITARIZED OUR POLICE SYSTEM. AND NOT TO SAY THAT THERE AREN'T POINTS IN THAT SYSTEM THAT. NEED MILITARIZATION BUT AS FAR AS THE MENTAL HEALTH BECAUSE MENTAL HEALTH IS A HUGE ISSUE. IN TODAY'S SOCIETY AND A LOT OF PEOPLE. ARE WALKING AROUND WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS AND THEY'RE LOOKED UPON WITH A LOT OF FEAR AND SO MAYBE. WITHIN THAT BILL COULD WE INCLUDE MORE TRAINING. FOR POLICE OFFICERS TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE RAVAGED BY MENTAL ILLNESS AT. I AM I MYSELF HAVE FAMILY MEMBER HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER WHO SUFFERS FROM MENTAL ILLNESS AND HAS SUFFERED GREATLY AT THE HANDS OF. THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. OUR POLICE OFFICERS AND. AS PAINFUL AS THAT IS A FAMILY MEMBER TO WATCH I UNDERSTAND THE POSITION OF THE POLICE OFFICERS. BUT I DO THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE TRAINING. AND THAT IN THAT FIELD AND THAT'S ALL THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMMA REALLY APPRECIATE IT. WE HAVE A NUMBER AND ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE- THE PUBLIC WHO WILL BE APPROACHING THE MICROPHONE WE JUST ASK THAT YOU. A STEP BEHIND THE PLEXIGLAS DON'T TOUCH THE MICROPHONE.

YES OKAY HI THANK YOU FOR TAKING PUBLIC COMMENTS AND I JUST WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT WE HEARD FROM A BLM REPRESENTATIVE EARLIER. AND SHE WAS SAYING THAT BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES NEED TO STOP LIKING FORTIES AND NEEDTO STOP ELEVATING THEM. AND THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE PUNISHMENT FOR POLICE OFFICERS. THIS IS THE KIND OF RHETORIC OF HATE THAT LEADS TO MORE VIOLENCE AND TO MORE MOTIVATING MORE TOLD POLICE OFFICERS. WHOSE LIVES MATTER JUST AS MUCH AS EVERYONE ELSE'S LIVES. THIS IS THE KIND OF RHETORIC THAT IS VERY DANGEROUS THERE NEEDS TO BE LESS HATE TOWARDS POLICE OFFICERS AND MORE SUPPORT AND TRAINING GIVEN TO THEM THEY HAD JUST AS MUCH HUMANS AS ALL OF US. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YEAH SURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE HAVE ONE MORE MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK AND BE HEARD ON THIS MATTER. OKAY NO PROBLEM.

ON THE LAWN OF THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE WHERE WE HAD BEEN WELCOMED FOUR HOURS. AND THEY'RE TERRORIZED MY NINE YEAR OLD WILL NOT COME TO THIS BUILDING IT SCARES HIM TOO MUCH.

AND REALLY GIVE THANKS TO EVERYBODY WHO DID POINT OUT THAT THIS IS A CULTURAL ISSUE S WELL AS- SYSTEMIC ISSUE. BUT WE NEED TO START. THINKING DIFFERENTLY. ABOUT CRIMINALIZATION AND ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO. YOU GROWING UP I WAS A CRIMINAL LIFE YEAR. AND I WAS ABLE TO GET MYSELF OUT OF THE SYSTEM. AND BECOME SOMEBODY WHO WOULD BE ABOUT THE CHECK. AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU. TO DO THAT. AND EVER SINCE- YOU KNOW THE- PROPOSITIONS THAT WERE POSSIBLY BY PETE WILSON.

FEELING I PRESSED ANY SITUATION BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES WITH ALL THE POWER THEY'RE THE ONES WITH GUNS POINTING GUNS AT A FORMER CHILDREN. SO THIS IS SOMETHING TO DEFINITELY THINK ABOUT THIS CONVERSATION NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED. IT'S GREAT THAT WE HAVE THIS I'D APPRECIATE IT BUT THERE'S A LOT OF PRIVILEGED VOICES IN THE CONVERSATION AND WE NEED TO HAVE THE COMP WE NEED TO HAVE THE VOICES OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE.

CAN YOU HEAR ME YES YES OKAY THANKS- I AM A- CALIFORNIA RESIDENT HAVE LIVED HERE ALL MY LIFE I AM A LAW ABIDING CITIZEN AND I SUPPORT THE POLICE I BELIEVE THAT THERE CAN BE. BAD APPLES IN EVERY- LINE OF EMPLOYMENT AND I THINK THAT PEOPLE. ARE YOU DOING REFORM ON BAD TEACHERS OR BAD STAFF MEMBERS THAT OTHER JOB OR BAD POLITICIANS NO WE DON'T HAVE THAT WE JUST HAVE THIS FOCUS ON BAD LAW ENFORCEMENT AND IT SEEMS LIKE WE ALREADY HAVE SYSTEMS IN PLACE THAT DEAL WITH. LAW ENFORCEMENT WHEN THEY DO THINGS THAT ARE ON CONSTITUTIONAL CONVICTIONS IT SOUNDED LIKE FROM WHEN I WAS LISTENING TO THE HEARING THAT THERE WAS ALREADY THOSE THINGS IN PLACE. SO WHAT IS IT THAT YOU'RE PERFORMING- I WATCHED THIS WHOLE LAST SUMMER. AS PEOPLE WERE PROTESTING SMASHING A BUSINESSES THE VEHICLE ON INDUSTRY. AND NOTHING NOTHING HAPPENS TO THEM BUT THEN WHEN WE'RE OUT THERE PEACEFULLY PROTEST SEEMS TO OPEN UP THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO YOU DON'T HAVE. PEOPLE OUT OF THE JOB WE GET ARRESTED FOR THAT I YOU KNOW WITNESS TO ALL THESE PEOPLE GET ARRESTED FOR STANDING THERE WITH A FINE ASKING TO OPEN UP CALIFORNIA YET YOU DO NOTHING TO ALL THE PEOPLE PRO TESTING. BLM AND ANTIFA PEOPLE NATIONAL BUSINESSES MAKING THINGS WORSE LAKE I JUST DON'T GET IT AND I WOULD LOVE TO READ MORE ABOUT WHAT THIS REFORM ACTUALLY IS. AND TALK ABOUT HOW YOU WILL FORM EVERYTHING ELSE BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST COLOR IT'S- I LIKE THE LAST COLOR ONE OF THE PREVIOUS CALLER THIRTY THERE YOU HAVE THIRTY SECONDS. IF YOU'LL LISTEN TO THE COPS AND ABIDE BY WHAT THEY'RE SAYING. YOU DON'T GET TO BE A VICTIM LIKE THIS PEOPLE TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR OWN LIVES AND BE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR ACTIONS HELLO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OPERATORS ARE ANOTHER CALL. OPERATOR DEFINITE A CALL THANK YOU. ALL. YOUR LINE IS OPEN YES HI MY NAME IS JULIAN RANDALL I'M AN AMERICAN HISTORIAN EDUCATOR CONSTITUTIONALIST I HAVE MANY FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND THE TERM PRIVILEGE IS GETTING NOT EATING MORE BY THE DAY SO THAT PREVIOUS CALLER WHO TALK CAN'T TALK ABOUT PRIVILEGE PRIVILEGE PRIVILEGED WE'RE TIRED OF THAT ALREADY IT'S NOT IT COULD BE TO KNOW WHERE MY NEPHEW AND UNCLE AND FAMILY MEMBERS TO OUR POLICE OFFICERS ARE NOT PRIVILEGED HE THEY WENT THROUGH INTENSE TRAINING THEY GET UP EVERY DAY AND THEY PUT ON THAT BADGE AND THEY GO OUT THERE TO SAVE LIVES AND THEY GO OUT TO THEIR TO PROTECT PEOPLE. AND SO TO VIEW OF BLACK LIVES MATTER IT'S PRIVILEGE THEY HAVE A NINETY MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET WHY DON'T THEY INVEST ABOUT THAT TO THESE COMMUNITIES THAT WEALTHY WHO'S REALLY PRIVILEGED BLACK LIVES MATTER IT'S PRIVILEGE MY NEPHEW AND MY UNCLE WHO SERVICE VALIANTLY EVERY SINGLE DAY WHEN.

AND THOSE PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT THEY'RE SO RIGHTEOUS THAT THEY CAN LABEL HATE GROUPS ARE THE ONES WHO THIS WILL TURN ON VERY VERY QUICKLY SO THIS IS THAT EXTREMELY DANGEROUS POLICE REFORM BILL- THAT I THINK IS MADE IN GREAT HASTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OPERATORS THERE ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK. SURE THERE IS NO ONE ELSE TO SIGNAL THAT THEY WISH TO SPEAK AT THIS TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL TEAM PUBLIC COMMENT. OF CLOSE AT THIS POINT IN TIME I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE SPEAKERS FOR PROVIDING THEIR INSIGHT REGARDING THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES I HOPE THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO GAIN INSIGHT TODAY'S REGARDING THE COMMUNITY IMPACT. OF OFFICERS A BAD JUDGMENT AND WHAT TOOLS ARE AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE RECOVERY THIS ISN'T ABOUT ATTACKING ALL OF LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT IT'S ABOUT PUSHING THEM TO DO BETTER BECAUSE THE IMPACT GOES FAR BEYOND THE VICTIMS OF MISCONDUCT COMMUNITIES. HAVE TO REBUILD AND LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS TO FIND WAYS TO REGAIN THE COMMUNITIES TRUST AFTER EVERY. INCIDENT NOT JAZZ- THOSE YOU READ ABOUT OR SEE- GOING VIRAL ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXPAND ON TOPICS LIKE THIS IN ORDER TO EXPOSE SOLUTIONS.

PIECES OF LEGISLATION OR POLICE REFORM BILLS GOING THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS- HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE. SIMILARLY WE ARE HOPING TO ENSURE THAT THOSE THAT HAVE TAKEN THE OATH OF OFFICE TO SERVE AND PROTECT OUR TRULY SERVING AND PROTECTING. THIS IS ABOUT JUSTICE THIS COMMITTEE HAS BROUGHT MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES TO THE TABLE EVEN WHEN THOSE INVOLVED ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT BECAUSE WE MUST ALL WORK TOGETHER- TO CHANNEL AND FIND SOLUTIONS TO THIS ISSUE THAT FACE- THE STATE. THESE CHANGES DEMAND SOBRE UNDERSTANDING ADD A WILLINGNESS TO HEAR OPPOSITE SIDES OF YOU AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BODY HAS- ENDEAVOR ITSELF TO PUT SPEAKERS AND EXPERTS IN COMMUNITY- AT THE TABLE TO HAVE AND LET THEIR VOICES BE HEARD IN THIS SPACE.
