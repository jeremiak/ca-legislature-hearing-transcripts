ACTUALLY I HAVE A I HAVE A

01:12:06.455 --> 01:12:08.257
QUESTION AND THAT'S WHAT I KNOW

01:12:08.323 --> 01:12:12.027
THAT. ERICA RATES ARE ARE LOW-

01:12:12.094 --> 01:12:13.362
AND NOBODY WANTS TO SEE THEM

01:12:13.429 --> 01:12:15.664
REDUCED IN ANYWAY SO I GUESS

01:12:15.731 --> 01:12:17.866
THE QUESTION I HAVE- IS THERE

01:12:17.933 --> 01:12:19.401
IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THT THE

01:12:19.468 --> 01:12:21.136
CURRENT METHODOLOGY HAS CREATED

01:12:21.203 --> 01:12:22.738
AN ACCESS PROBLEM SO I GUESS

01:12:22.805 --> 01:12:24.940
WHAT I'M ASKING FOR IS- ARE THE

01:12:25.007 --> 01:12:27.076
NUMBER OF LABS DECLARE-

01:12:27.142 --> 01:12:29.311
DECLINING MEDICARE BUSINESS. OR

01:12:29.378 --> 01:12:31.513
LIMITING THEIR PARTICIPATION IN

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:33.315
THE PROGRAM. WELL INSTRUMENT

01:12:33.382 --> 01:12:35.751
THE AT THE CUTS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:12:35.818 --> 01:12:37.052
TRIGGERED BY THE FEDERAL

01:12:37.119 --> 01:12:39.088

IMPLEMENTED HERE IN CALIFORNIA

01:12:40.355 --> 01:12:42.157
SO. THE GOAL FOR THIS BILL IS

01:12:42.224 --> 01:12:44.526
TO TAKE ACTION BEFORE THOSE AT

01:12:44.593 --> 01:12:46.595
WE SEE THAT DECREASING ACCESS

01:12:46.662 --> 01:12:48.831
WHICH- WE DO EXPECT AND I THINK

01:12:48.897 --> 01:12:50.032
OUR WITNESSES MAY HAVE SOME

01:12:50.099 --> 01:12:52.067
COMMENTS. WE DO EXPECT THAT IF

01:12:52.134 --> 01:12:53.502
THESE CHANGES ARE TRIGGERED IF

01:12:53.569 --> 01:12:56.338
WE SEE LABORATORY REIMBURSEMENT

01:12:56.405 --> 01:12:58.006
RATES THAT ARE EFFECTIVELY. B.

01:12:58.073 --> 01:12:59.408
BELOW THE COST OF PROVIDING A

01:12:59.475 --> 01:13:01.376
SERVICE WE WILL SEE

01:13:01.443 --> 01:13:03.312

01:13:05.214 --> 01:13:06.982
LABORATORY CAPACITY AND ACCESS

01:13:07.049 --> 01:13:09.351
