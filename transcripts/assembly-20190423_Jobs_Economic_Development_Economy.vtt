00:39:20.558 --> 00:39:22.393
ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR OUR SMALL

DYNAMIC GLOBAL MARKET PLACE.

00:39:47.718 --> 00:39:49.086
IN OUR LETTER WE DISCUSSED HOW

00:39:49.153 --> 00:39:50.755
IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR SMALL

00:39:50.821 --> 00:39:53.190
MANUFACTURERS TO MISS OUT ON NEW

00:39:53.257 --> 00:39:55.159

MANAGE THAT EXTRA SHIFT -- SO

00:40:04.168 --> 00:40:06.570
THE FOCUS ON SMALL MANUFACTURING

00:40:06.637 --> 00:40:08.706

00:40:10.107 --> 00:40:11.575
A COUPLE OF THINGS I LIKE TO

00:40:11.642 --> 00:40:13.110
HIGHLIGHT IS THAT THIS BILL IS

00:40:13.177 --> 00:40:14.645
UTILIZING.

00:40:14.712 --> 00:40:16.814
AN EXISTING SYSTEM WITHIN THE

00:40:16.881 --> 00:40:19.483

KNOWN BY THIS ENTITY AND HOW

00:40:34.431 --> 00:40:36.167
THIS DIFFERS FROM THE EXISTING

00:40:36.233 --> 00:40:38.335
SYSTEM IS THAT.

00:40:38.402 --> 00:40:40.538
THE LEASE OWNS IN THOSE SYSTEMS

00:40:40.604 --> 00:40:42.640
ARE ACTUALLY BRIDGING FOR SMALL

00:40:42.706 --> 00:40:44.742

00:40:47.411 --> 00:40:48.479
LIAISON.

00:40:48.546 --> 00:40:50.714

DON'T ALREADY HAVE RELATIONSHIPS

00:40:56.654 --> 00:40:57.922

00:40:57.988 --> 00:41:00.090
THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIND US
