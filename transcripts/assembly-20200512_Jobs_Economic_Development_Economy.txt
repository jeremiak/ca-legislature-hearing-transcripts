THANK YOU MISTER TURN DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TODAY I'M PRESENTING ASSEMBLY BILL THREE ONE ZERO ONE WHICH WILL INFUSE CAPITAL INTO LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THROUGH PRIVATE INVESTMENTS. IN FACT INCENTIVIZE BY A CALIFORNIA AT NEW MARKETS TAX CREDIT OR SEE AN- EMPTY SEAT. I'M PROUD TO JOIN ASSEMBLY WOMAN CERVANTES IN INTRODUCING THIS LEGISLATION AND I THANK HER FOR HER LEADERSHIP AS CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE SHE HAS ADVANCE MANY BILLS THAT BENEFIT CALIFORNIA'S OUT CALIFORNIANS STATE RIGHT. AB THREE ONE ZERO ONE IS THE NINTH OF VERSION OF A BILL ATTEMPTING TO ESTABLISH A STATE N. M. T. C. IN THE PAST THE BILL HAS STALLED DUE TO THE COST ASSOCIATED. WITH PROVIDING THIS EIGHT TO SMALL BUSINESSES AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNICATION AT COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER OTHER STATES THAT HAVE ADOPTED THE PROGRAM REPORTED RETURN ON INVESTMENTS OF UP TO THIRTEEN TO ONE WITH THE N. M. T. C. PAYING FOR ITSELF WITHIN TWO YEARS OF IMPLEMENTATION. AS. REFLECTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. THIS IS PROVEN DATE OF A SHOWS THAT E. AND SEE F. HIGHS ARE ABLE TO DRAW IN. EIGHT DOLLARS IN PRIVATE CAPITAL FOR EVERY STATE DOLLAR IN CREDITS. ECONOMIC DISPARITIES AMONG DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE STATE AND BETWEEN NEIGHBORHOODS WITHIN. OTHERWISE ECONOMICALLY STABLE CITIES WERE ALREADY AFFECTED. I AFFECTING CALIFORNIANS AS WE BEGAN TO ADDRESS THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT MANY COMMUNITIES WITH THE ECONOMICALLY DISTRESSED DESIGNATION STILL HAVE NOT FULLY RECOVERED FROM THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT GREAT RECESSION. THESE REGIONS NOW HAVE COVERT NINETEEN CRISIS PUTTING ECONOMIC RECOVERY EVEN FURTHER INTO THE FUTURE. GIVEN THIS LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES ARE INEVITABLY LOOKING AT THE LONGER LONGEST RECOVERY TIME FRAME. IN ADDITION COVERED NINETEEN DEATHS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTING LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR OR A LACK OF ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTHCARE AND STABLE HOUSING MAKES RESIDENTS EVEN MORE VULNERABLE TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. AT THE STATE AN MTC CAN PROVIDE LONG LASTING RECOVERY BENEFITS TO LEVELING INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS BY INCENTIVIZING INVESTMENTS AND SMALL BUSINESSES AND THE COMMUNITY PROJECTS. AS THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY WORKS THROUGH ITS COVERED NINETEEN ECONOMIC RECOVERY STRATEGY AB THIRTY ONE ZERO ONE IS A USEFUL TOOL AND ENSURING ECONOMIC SECURITY DURING THE CRISIS WHILE CREATING A MORE EQUITABLE FUTURE. THE N. M. T. C. MODEL IS BASED ON EXISTING FEDERAL PROGRAMS AND HAVE ALREADY BEEN USED IN ELEVEN STATES. OVER HALF OF THE INVESTMENTS ALREADY DEPLOYED UNDER THE FEDERAL NMTC WERE IN AREAS WHERE THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATES ARE A HUNDRED AND 50% ABOVE THE STATE AVERAGE. THE MODEL WORKS THROUGH EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND QUALIFY COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OR SEE DFI AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DEVELOPMENT ENTITIES CD. THE PROGRAM WORKS BY INCENTIVIZING PRIVATE INVESTORS WITH A TAX CREDIT GIVEN IN EXCHANGE FOR AN EQUITY INVESTMENT IN THE CD OR SEE DFI OF THEIR CHOICE. THE CDF I OR C. D. E. MUST USE THIS EQUITY TO MAKE INVESTMENTS WHICH WILL RESULT IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. THE FUNDS ALLOCATED PURSUANT TO THIS BILL WILL BE DISTRIBUTED AND ADMINISTERED BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND CURRENT BILL LANGUAGE WILL PROVIDE FOR FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN TAX CREDITS ANNUALLY. BASED OFF OF YEARS OF DATA OF IDENTICAL PROGRAMS FUNDS IN THIS BILL COULD NOT BE USED FOR REAL ESTATE BUSINESSES CHARTER SCHOOLS GOLF RELATED TO STOP IT IT IS DEVILISH MEANT OR BARS AND CARD ROOMS. NATIONWIDE CD EASE AND CDF EYES CAN APPLY BUT ONLY THOSE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE AN ABILITY TO OPERATE IN LOW INCOME REGIONS IN CALIFORNIA WILL BE APPROVED. FOR TRANSPARENCY PURPOSES INSTITUTIONS APPROVED FOR THESE TAX CREDITS MUST PROVIDE ANNUAL REPORTS TO THE GOAL BIDS. ON THEIR USE AN IMPACT. AFTER TWO HUNDRED DAYS ANY UNUSED CREDITS ALLOCATED SHALL REVERT BACK TO GO BIDS FOR REDISTRIBUTION. AB THIRTY ONE ZERO ONE IS BASED ON THE ECONOMIC PRINCIPLE THAT TARGETING SIGNIFICANT INCENTIVES TO LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES ALLOW THESE COMMUNITIES TO MORE EFFECTIVELY COMPETE FOR NEW BUSINESSES. AND RETAIN EXISTING BUSINESSES WHICH RESULT IN INCREASED TAX REVENUES LESS RELIANCE ON SOCIAL SERVICES AND LOWER PUBLIC SAFETY COSTS. ARE CONSTITUENTS AND BUSINESS OWNERS WILL ALSO DIRECT BENEFIT DIRECTLY BENEFIT FROM THE RESULTING SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THROUGH IMPROVED AND NEIGHBORHOODS BUSINESS EXPANSION AND JOB CREATION. WITHOUT PROGRAMS LIKE THIS THE ECONOMY CANNOT SUSTAIN THE CURRENT LEVEL OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND WE BUILD. AS I STATED. THIS BILL IS A JOINT EFFORT WITH ASSEMBLY WOMAN CERVANTES THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE. AND IS A NEWER VERSION OF- THIS RIVAS IS A BILL LAST YEAR I AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIGHT FOOT. THE BILL.
