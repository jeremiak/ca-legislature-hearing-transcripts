IN HELPING OUR STATE. SUCCESSFULLY. MEET THE CHALLENGES OF THE DAY AND BUILD THIS CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE TOGETHER. AND EXTEND THE BENEFITS OF THIS TRANSITION TO A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE TO EVERY COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING. DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES I'M PRIVILEGED TO WORK WITH A DEDICATED HARDWORKING STAFF AND A DISTINGUISHED GROUP OF FELLOW COMMISSIONERS INCLUDING OUR VICE CHAIR THERE SCOTT COMMISSIONER ANDREW MCALLISTER. THE COMMISSIONER KAREN DOUGLAS ARE FORTUNATELY THANKS TO GOVERNOR NEWSOME LATER THIS MONTH I'LL BE SWEARING IN OUR NEWS COMMISSIONER. PATRICIA MONAGHAN WHICH MONTH MARKS A VERY IMPORTANT MILESTONE BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME. IN THE FORTY FOUR YEAR HISTORY OF THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION WE WILL HAVE A MAJORITY OF WOMEN COMMISSIONERS. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS WE BUILD A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE WE WANT TO BUILD AN ENERGY COMMISSION AND ENERGY INDUSTRY THAT LOOKS LIKE CALIFORNIA. ARE THE OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE AS I IMPORTANT INCUBATOR ROLLED A MODERN WINDOWS TREE THE MODERN STEEL INDUSTRY THE MODERN ELECTRIC VEHICLE HISTORY WE'RE ALL BORN IN CALIFORNIA SPREAD AROUND THE WORLD. THE FIRST ENERGY EFFICIENCY CODES AND STANDARDS. ARE BORN HERE IN CALIFORNIA SPREAD AROUND THE WORLD AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE DOING A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE LOOKING WE HAD SIXTY SIX INTERNATIONAL DELEGATIONS BUT THAT LAST YEAR. WE HAVE A GREAT STORY TO TELL IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS WE'VE GIVEN OUT ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. TO DO ENERGY EFFICIENCY UPGRADES THROUGH PROP THIRTY NINE IN SCHOOLS IN EVERY COUNTY IN THE STATE THOSE SCHOOLS ARE NOW SAVING OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. ON THEIR ENERGY BILLS WHICH IS MONEY THAT GOES BACK IN THE CLASSROOM TO HIRE TEACHERS. AND EXPENDED BY TEXT BOOKS -- WE'RE DOING THINGS LIKE MICRO GRIDS ON FIRE DEPARTMENTS I DEDICATED ALONG WITH MAYOR MADE FROM FREMONT WHO'S HERE WITH US AS WELL -- THE SOLE AMERICA GET ON THE FREMONT FIRE DEPARTMENT LAST WEEK WE DID ONE FOR THE RANCHERIA TRIBE A BULLET RANCHERIA UP IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY -- TO PROVIDE RESILIENCE AND IS AS AN EXAMPLE -- NOT LONG AFTER WE BUILT THAT BIKER GRID. A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT THERE WAS A FIRE THE GREAT WHEN OUT IN THEIR FIRST AID CENTER WAS ABLE TO STAY OPEN BECAUSE OF THAT -- AND YOU LOOK AHEAD AND WHAT WHAT ELSE WE'RE DOING THE PLANT THE SEEDS OF THE ENERGY FUTURE A LOT OF IT DOESN'T GET ATTENTION BUT IT MATTERS A LOT THINGS LIKE. TELEVISION STANDARDS WE IN TWO THOUSAND NINE ADOPTED THE STANDARDS CUT THE ENERGY USE OF TV'S AND HALF. THE SELLING OUR MARKET YOU HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE STANDARDS THAT SEE IF CALIFORNIANS A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR REDUCES POLLUTION. REDUCES REPAIR COSTS -- GOING FORWARD I WANT TO DO A BETTER JOB OF TELLING THE SUCCESS STORIES HELPING OTHER STATES AND OTHER NATIONS -- FOLLOW SUIT -- THE CHALLENGES WE FACE ARE STEEP. MANDELA OF BUT I THINK THE OPPORTUNITY. IS INSTRUMENT AS WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M GONNA START WITH IT DO YOU HAVE TO LEAVE MR ROTH YOU HAVE TO GO TO A COMMITTEE. THE WAY THEY ARE. OKAY HUMM I WILL ET HER BUT I START WITH YOU SENATOR ROTH -- WE ALWAYS WANT TO BE EFFICIENT AND HELP OUR COLLEAGUES WHO ARE DOING MULTIPLE THINGS AT A TIME SO I'LL START WITH YOU. VENTURE RESOLUTION SIR I LOOK FORWARD -- TO MOVING YOUR CONFIRMATION AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. HOW DIFFICULT IS IT GOING TO BE FOR US TO RETAIN OUR -- STATES CLEAN ENERGY AND AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTION GOALS WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THOSE HERE WE'VE TAKEN A BUNCH OF VOTES OVER THE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE AND I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT YOUR THOUGHT IS ON THAT AND HOW DIFFICULT IS IT GOING TO BE TO ATTAIN. THOSE WHAT TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES ARE WE GOING TO HAVE TO HOPE FOR THE FUTURE IN ORDER TO GET THERE. THANK YOU SIR APPRECIATE THE QUESTION SO LET'S JUST START WITH WHERE WE ARE NOW WE'RE AT WE'VE TRIPLED RENEWABLE ENERGY PRODUCTION LAST TEN YEARS. I'M SORRY WE TROUBLED RENEWABLE ENERGY PRODUCTION LAST TEN YEARS IN OUR STATE WE DON'T COUNT LARGE HYDRO IS A RENEWABLE THE MANY OTHER COMMITTEES DO. OF YOU HAVE LARGE HYDRO WORD ABOUT 45% TODAY IF YOU ADD THE ABLOW WE'RE ABOUT 55%. CARBON FREE TODAY SO MY VIEW IS THAT GETTING 2100% IS. A CHALLENGE BUT IT'S ABSOLUTELY A SOLVABLE CHALLENGE I THINK GETTING 280% IS RELATIVELY EASY. GETTING 9% IT'S HARD GETTING NOTHING ABOUT THAT THAT'S OUTSIDE THE REALM OF A SOLVABLE PROBLEM. AND THE TECHNOLOGIES WERE DEVELOPING NOW TO HELP MANIPULATE DEMAND WE HAVE WE'VE DONE THINGS THAT WE FUNDED. THIRTY SEVEN ENERGY STORAGE DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS -- THERE'S ENORMOUS POTENTIAL SO A LOT OF OTHER STATES ARE WATCHING WHAT WE DO AND IN FACT ON THE IN NEW MEXICO AND DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IN A WHITE EIGHT OTHER STATES HAVE INTRODUCED THAT LEGISLATION -- WHERE TWENTY THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE'S ANOTHER FOUR HAVE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO STUDY IT -- SO WE'RE BEING WATCHED CLOSELY I AM VERY OPTIMISTIC BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN ENORMOUS COST REDUCTION WHEN I GOT INTO THE SOLAR INDUSTRY. TWENTY YEARS AGO -- IT WAS FIFTY CENTS A KILOWATT HOUR WE ARE FIRST BID IN CALIFORNIA LAST SUMMER -- UNDER TWO CENTS A pWITH COST REDUCTION SO I'M VERY OPTIMISTIC WE CAN MEET THE TEST. ARE THE IS IS STORAGE THE LIMITING FACTOR. WELL SO IT'S A DAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IT'S NOT LIKE US ONE SILVER BULLET SOLUTION IT'S REALLY SILVER BUCKSHOT STORAGE IS ONE OF THE THINGS YOU NEED. YOU NEED INTELLIGENT ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING PROTOCOLS WE WANT TO HAVE WHAT I CALL AN EEVEE HAPPY HOUR WHERE THEY'RE PLUGGED IN TO THE GRID WHEN WE HAVE SURPLUS RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION. THERE'S DEMAND RESPONSE TO BE ABLE TO THERE'S THINGS LIKE PRE COOLING BUILDINGS ANOTHER LOAD THAT'S FLEXIBLE -- YOU LOOK AT THE NEXT WAVE OF TRANSPORTATION IT'S COMING ELECTRIC SCHOOL BUSES ARE AN ENORMOUS ASSET BECAUSE THEY'RE ACTUALLY PLUGGED IN. A TO THE GRID -- DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY WHEN WE HAVE SURPLUS RENEWABLES ALL THESE THINGS. TAKEN TOGETHER ARE HOW WE HOW WAS AND ALSO AS A DIVERSITY OF RENEWABLE ENERGIES ENERGY SOURCE OF WE DON'T WANT ALL SOLAR WE WANT -- GEOTHERMAL AND BIOMASS AND OFFSHORE WIND AND ALL THE REST. THE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD IS. GOING TO BE -- HEAVILY FOCUSED ON HEAVY DUTY TRUCK -- TECHNOLOGIES HOW HOW DOES THE ENERGY COMMISSION INTERFACE WITH THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD ON THAT PARTICULAR SUBJECT IF AT ALL. SO WE HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THEM WE GIVE AWAY ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO SUPPORT CLEAN TRANSPORTATION AND PARTNER WITH THEM -- WE HAVE FUNDED SOME HEAVY DUTY. VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES AND ACTUALLY THE NEW COMMISSIONER WHO'S COMING IN COMMISSIONER MONAGHAN WILL BE THE LEAD FOR THAT SHE'S GOT TWENTY YEARS OF BACKGROUND -- IN TRANSPORTATION OUR CURRENT VICE CHAIR JIMMY SCOTT'S TO THE TREMENDOUS JOB LEADING THAT EFFORT BUT IT'S AN ISSUE BY ISSUE -- COORDINATION WITH THEM. THANK YOU SIR CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND CONSIDER. YOU VERY MUCH MR VICE CHAIRMAN YOU WANT TO GO NEXT. SURE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. SO I KNOW I DON'T NORMALLY ASK QUESTIONS THAT I HAD ALREADY DONE IN PRIVATE I WAS A LITTLE UNDER THE WEATHER WHEN WE MET SO SOME STUFF POPPED UP SINCE I KNOW YOU CAN HANDLE SO IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL. SO I HYDROGEN CARS. I'VE DRIVEN I HAD DRIVEN AND THEY'RE VERY IMPRESSIVE BUT THERE'S THERE'S NO INFRASTRUCTURE -- YOU SEE IF YOU TURN HYDROGEN CARS AND IF SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO TO MAKE THAT A REALITY. SO THERE IS A STATE GOAL WHICH IS TWO HUNDRED HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS. I WILL SAY YOU KNOW THE MOMENTUM IN THE INVESTMENT AMONG AUTOMAKERS NOW SHIFTED. THAT TEND TO ONE FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES VERSUS HYDROGEN CARS. WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE AND FIFTY THOUSAND ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN THE STATE AND SIX THOUSAND HI GIN FUEL CELL PASSENGER VEHICLES. ARE JUST TO BE TOTALLY CANDID I THINK THE SHIP HAS SAILED IN TERMS OF PASSENGER VEHICLES I THINK THE THE MOMENTUM IS VERY CLEARLY. TOWARDS ELECTRIC I THINK THE NIECE HYDROGEN IS BEST SUITED FOR US REALLY AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCKING -- AND AND AROUND PORTS AND SO FORTH AND SO WE'VE BEEN FINDING SOME SOME WORK IN THAT AREA. A GREAT. SO I MEAN HISTORY APPOINTMENTS I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE HIGHLIGHTS OF YOUR FIRST TERM. IN MAY AND WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR GOALS FOR THE SECOND TERM IT MAYBE TOUCH ON BECAUSE I THINK THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO ATTACK CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGH INNOVATION AND YOU SURE SOME VERY INTERESTING THINGS WITH ME AT THE OTHER DAY SO. YOU COULD TOUCH ON THOSE I'D APPRECIATE YOUR FIRST WITH THE CHALLENGES I WOULD SAY THE P. GINNY. BANKRUPTCY IS A COLOSSAL CHALLENGE AND THE PROSPECT OF ELECTRIC RATES SICK IN INCREASING SIGNIFICANTLY IS A MAJOR CONCERN ELECTRIC RATES THEMSELVES TODAY OUR CLIMATE POLICY. BECAUSE IT'S THE CASE TODAY EVERYWHERE IN EVERY ELECTRIC SERVICE TERRITORY IN CALIFORNIA IT'S CHEAPER. TO DRIVE A MILE ON ELECTRIC CAR THAN IT IS FROM INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE. ELECTRIC RATES DOUBLING UP 80% THAT'S NO LONGER THE CASE IT'S CHEAPER EVERYWHERE IN CALIFORNIA TO HEAT YOUR WATER WITH ELECTRIC HEAT PUMP WATER HEATER THAT'S CLEAN -- THEN IT IS A NATURAL GAS WATER THAT'S NOT THE CASE OF ELECTRIC RATES GO UP SO FINDING A WAY THROUGH THIS P. GINNY. SITUATION IN A WAYTHAT DOESN'T -- ADVERSELY IMPACT ELECTRIC RATES IS PARAMOUNT NOT JUST TO THE BETTER THE RATE PAYERS BUT TO THE BENEFIT. OF OUR CLIMATE GOALS -- WITH RESPECT TO WHERE THE ENERGY COMMISSION IS COME I AM. REALLY PROUD OF THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE I MEAN I I'VE JUST FINISHED DOING A DEEP DIVE DIVISION REVIEW. WITH -- ALL OF OUR DIVISIONS -- WE GAVE OUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR. ON AND TELL ME THE LEVEL OF PROFESSIONALISM THE MOTIVATION TO FIRE IN THE BELLY -- AT THE DEPUTY LEVEL IS AS STRONG AS IT'S EVER BEEN -- AND WE'RE GETTING THE AREA WHERE I REALLY WANT TO PROVE ON PERSONAL WOULD LIKE MORE RESOURCES SO. PLEASE -- SEND HEM OUR WAY IN TERMS OF WE WANT TO BE DOING MORE THIS PARTICULAR AROUND ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH WILL PLAY TO YOUR QUESTION SENATOR -- SPECIALLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN HELPING INTEGRATE RENEWABLES -- SUCCESSFULLY MORE QUICKLY AND DRIVE INNOVATION WE HAVE TWELVE ELECTRIC VEHICLE -- MANUFACTURES NOW IN THE STATE AND AND MORE WILL COME AS THE MARKET. EXPANDS BUT THE THEORY I REALLY WANT TO DRILL DOWN AND IS IS ACTUALLY TELLING THE SUCCESS STORIES BECAUSE THERE'S AN ENORMOUS SUCCESS STORIES I MEAN. THE STATE HAS FUNDED ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND AND THAT WE HAVE THE LARGEST MANUFACTURING SITE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DAYS ELECTRIC VEHICLE FACTORY TESLA. I WORKED ACROSS THE STREET FROM THEIR WEIGHT WHEN I WAS IN SILICON VALLEY WHEN IT WAS THE THE GM FACTORY AND TESSA PLACE TWICE AS MANY PEOPLE THAT SITE -- AS WINNERS JIM SO THE POTENTIAL TO GO BIG IS THERE -- BUT THE YOU KNOW THE PHILOSOPHY WE HAVE TO FOLLOW IS WHAT I CALL THE PHILOSOPHY OF SUSTAINED ORDERLY DEVELOPMENT WHERE YOU SET LONG TERM STABLE POLICIES WHICH WE NOW HAVE SP ONE HUNDREDS OF FOUNDATIONAL POLICY -- ALONG WITH MANY OTHERS -- AND GET AWAY FROM THE EARLY MISTAKES THAT WE MADE WHICH HAD TO DO WITH HAVING AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO LAST FOR ONE YEAR AND THEN COLLAPSES AND GETS RESTARTED YOU CAN'T. BUILD A COMPANY YOU CAN'T PLAN YOU CAN'T GROW WITH THAT I THINK WE'VE LEARNED THAT LESSON AND THAT'S THAT'S WERE TRYING TO FOLLOW. I APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWERS LOOKING FOR DEVOTING ON YOUR CONFIRMATION THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. VERY MUCH SENATOR BAIT. IT IS FEAR AGAIN THIS HOUSE I AM THEN WE HAD A VERY VERY PRODUCTIVE -- DISCUSSION IN MY OFFICE IN FACT I THINK I TOOK UP MORE TIME IN ASKING YOU THE QUESTIONS AND YOU HOW. TO HOW DO YOU ANSWER BECAUSE IT'S A SUCH A IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THING IS WE ARE APPROACHING ARE THE ISSUES REGARDING OUR CLIMATE CHANGE ONE QUESTION ON NOW THAT'S ALL I REALLY HAVE BECAUSE I FELT COMFORTABLE WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT DIVERSIFICATION IN TERMS OF HOW WE PRODUCE OUR ENERGY. BUT ARE THE FOLDER ISSUE WHICH WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON I DIDN'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK YOU HOW YOU ARE ADDRESSING THE CONCERN. THAT'S BEGINNING ON IN THIS GENERATION REGARDING HOW WE DISPOSE OF THE SOLAR PANELS ARE BECAUSE THEY HAVE THEY ARE SPECIFIC LIFE CYCLE. AND THERE IS A CONCERN THAT WE HAVE NOT ADDRESSED THAT IN PROBABLY EARLIER IS BETTER. OUR WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT I THINK COMES THING FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ARE COMING ON WITHIN THE TWENTY YEAR LIFESPAN OF A SOLAR PANEL. ANY THOUGHTS ON MATTERS THAT WOULD THAT BE ON YOUR TO DO LIST ISSUE -- YOU KNOW. YEAH SWORN IN AND THEN START YOUR OWN YOUR OWN PROGRAM YOUR YOUR WORK PROGRAM THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I SHOULD NOTE -- IN A FEW WEEKS WE'RE GONNA BE MARKING -- THE OCCASION OF CALIFORNIA HITTING ONE MILLION -- SOLAR ROOF TOPS -- AND BOB RUMORS HERE WITH US AS WELL AND THE AUDIENCE THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATIONS BEEN VERY INVOLVED IN THE SOLAR NEW CONSTRUCTION SPACE -- SO LOOK AT SOLAR PANELS -- HAVE A TWENTY FIVE YEAR WARRANTY THE ACTUAL LIFE CYCLE IS CONSIDERABLY LONGER THAN THAT THE MATERIALS INSIDE THE SOLAR PANEL. THE SILICON THE EVA THE BAKSHI THE JUNCTION BOX THE GLASS THE FRAMES ARE VERY DURABLE THERE BEEN SOLD HILLS IN OPERATION FOR IN EXCESS OF SIXTY YEARS -- THEY DIMINISH DOWN ABOUT 80% OF THEIR NAMEPLATE RATING AFTER TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND THEN TEND TO STAY AT ROUGHLY THAT OUTPUT. SO THEY ACTUALLY WILL HAVE A CONSIDERABLY LONGER LIFE -- THE MATERIALS ARE ALL RECYCLABLE -- AND YOU KNOW I THINK ALONG WITH THE EVERY OTHER MATERIAL AND THAT'S ONLY GOING TO DEAL WITH AT THAT TIME BUT I DON'T. YEAH I DON'T SEE THAT THERE IS A HUGE CHALLENGE. I JUST THINK IT CAME FORWARD BECAUSE WE'RE HAVING ISSUES WITH RECYCLABLES AND THE WHOLE RECYCLING INDUSTRY SO. IT IS SOMETHING THAT'S INTERESTING -- THAT'S ACTUALLY NEW INFORMATION CAUSES A LONGER LIFE CYCLE YES A LOT MORE TIME SO WE DON'T HAVE TO CONTEMPLATE LET'S SAY A FEE RIGHT NOW. IN TERMS OF DISPOSAL AND THINGS THAT WERE ASKING OTHER ON INDUSTRIES TO DO SO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND AGAIN I WAS VERY PLEASED WITHOUT OUR DISCUSSION IN THE OFFICE. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER MONEY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I WANNA ALSO OFFER MY CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR REAPPOINTMENT AND NOW AS CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOUR FAMILY FOR THEIR PRESENCE NOT ONLY TODAY BUT FOR THEIR SUPPORT OF YOU AND SHARING YOU WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND ALSO WON A KNOWLEDGE YOUR FATHER WHO I THINK IS A CALIFORNIA TREASURE AS WELL AS AN AUTHOR AND I LEADER ON ON MANY FRONTS SO IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU HERE TODAY AS WELL -- I ENJOYED OUR CONVERSATION IN AND WANT TO BRING YOU BACK YOU ALLUDED TO IN YOUR RESPONSE TO SENATOR ROTH -- TO WIND ENERGY IS PART OF OUR RENEWABLE ENERGY PORTFOLIO. IS YOU KNOW I REPRESENT AS PART OF MY DISTRICT SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY AND AND NOW DECOMMISSIONING. DIABLO CANYON THE LAST NUCLEAR POWER PLANT IN OPERATION IN CALIFORNIA SET TO DECOMMISSION. WE TALKED SOME ABOUT PROSPECTS ALONG CALIFORNIA'S COAST FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF WIND ENERGY. WHAT ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES THERE WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES IN? HOW IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- ARE THEY A PARTNER AS WE PURSUE WIND ENERGY THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION -- SO I AM PERSONALLY REALLY EXCITED AND OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OFFSHORE WIND JUST TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT WIND ON LAND IN CALIFORNIA GENERATES ELECTRICITY. ABOUT 35% OF THE HOURS OF THE DAY OFFSHORE WIND IS APPROACHING AND THE RESOURCES IS ENORMOUS IT'S ALSO HIGHLY COMPLIMENTARY IN THE GENERATION PROFILE TO SOLAR SOFTER WHEN IT'S UP IN THE MORNING. DOWN THE MIDDLE THE DAY COMES UP IN THE AFTERNOON EVENING. AND THE SIZE OF THE TURBINES IS SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER SO ON LAND IT'S TYPICALLY ABOUT TWO MEGAWATTS OFF SURE THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY IS GOING TO TWELVE MIKE WANTS. TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE. FIFTEEN RPM SO IT'S ONE ROTATION EVERY FOUR SECONDS OF THE TURBINE TOWERS A HOUSE FOR A DAY THAT'S THE SKILL THAT WERE OUT TODAY. ON WE'RE LUCKY TO BE A COASTAL STATE AND IN PARTICULAR IN THE CASE OF DIABLO TO HAVE SHORELINE INTERCONNECTION. I VISITED THE APPLE CANYON LAST WEEK WITH MY COLLEAGUE COMMISSIONER DOUGLAS THERE'S ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT IS CURRENTLY PLANNED TO BE DECOMMISSIONED AT A REPAIR COST OF FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. THAT IF YOU PUT OFF FOR WIND YOU WOULDN'T NEED TO DECOMMISSION OUT IN FACT IT'S SORT OF A TWO FOR BECAUSE OF YOU DO OFFER WHEN THERE. YOU WOULD AVOID HAVING A BILL THAT SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE STATE -- THE AND THE OTHER THING THE TECHNOLOGY FOR CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE HAVE A DEEP WATER SELF ALL THE TURBINES IN CALIFORNIA UNLIKE THE EAST COAST THE UNITED STATES. ARE ALL WOULD BE ON FLOATING DECKS -- YOU CAN PUT THOSE -- FIFTEEN MILES OUT WHERE THEY'RE NOT VISIBLE FROM SHORE YOU CAN PUT HIM CLOSER TO SHORE -- YOU CAN BE FLEXIBLE THAT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED AN OFFSHORE WIND TASK FORCE AND ARE DIGGING INTO THIS WITH ALL OF OUR PARTNERS INCLUDING THE NAVY THE COAST GUARD THE LAND COMMISSION BECAUSE COMMISSION. AND MANY OTHERS IF WE DO IT IN. STATE WATERS WHICH IS UP TO THREE MILES THAT'S SOME OF THE LATER LIVED IN TERMS OF NOT HAVING TO DEAL WITH THE THE PROMOTION OR TO MANAGEMENT IF WE DEAL IN FEDERAL WATERS. IT IS LEASED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THAT'S A PROCESS WERE WORKING THROUGH RIGHT NOW THE OBJECTION THERE ARE SOME ISSUES WITH THE NAVY. I BELIEVE THERE'S A PATH FORWARD THERE AND WE CAN FIND A COMMON GROUND THAT MEETS THEIR CONCERNS BUT CAN STILL -- ALLOW US TO MOVE FORWARD AND AND OFFICER WIND CAN BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR ENERGY MUSIC TO THE STATE. WELL THANK YOU IN I'M GLAD THIS IS SO PROMINENT IN NEAR. RADAR IN -- WITH COMMISSIONER DOUGLAS AND SHE'S BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN THIS AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT. AND THEN JUST MY FINAL QUESTION -- BACK TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THERE'S BEEN SOME DEREGULATION OF SOME OF OUR ADVANCES ON APPLIANCE. ISSUES AND SAFETY AND ALL THE WAY UP -- TO QUESTIONS AS TO WHETHER CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL OR NOT -- HOW DO YOU DESCRIBE THE CURRENT WORKING RELATIONSHIP PARTICULARLY ON ENERGY ISSUES BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT? IT COULD BE BETTER -- I WILL SAY THIS I MEAN WE'RE GOING TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND OUR PRODUCE AND PUSH S HARD AS WE CAN THERE'S THINGS LIKE APPLIANCE STANDARDS. FOR THE PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE ENERGY STAR WHICH MAKE NO SENSE TO ME -- HOWEVER I WILL SAY THE WAY OUR SYSTEM IS SET UP THE UNITED STATES TODAY MOST OF THE POWER TO DRIVE A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE MOST OF THE AUTHORITIES. REST WITH THE STATES SO OUR INTERCONNECTIONS STANDARDS ARE P. S.. TAX CREDITS PERMITS -- AND MANY OTHER THINGS ARE STILL STATE DECISIONS AND SO ON YOU KNOW WE'RE MAKING A LOT OF PROGRESS AND I POINT OUT YOU KNOW EVEN UNDER -- PRESIDENT TRUMP STILL THE MAJORITY OF NEW GENERATION CAPACITY COMING ON OF THE GRID HAS BEEN RENEWABLES -- STATES ARE STILL DRIVING THAT AND THE COSTS ARE LOW SO -- I'M STILL VERY OPTIMISTIC WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO MAKE UP PROGRESS WELL. I COULD GO ON BUT IN THE INTEREST OF TIME AND EVERYONE GATHERED HERE TO OFFER THEIR SUPPORT -- I WILL STOP THERE MADAM CHAIR AND WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING -- YEAR APPOINTMENT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR MINING -- AND THANK YOU FOR THE TIME YESTERDAY TO HAVE MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION WE'VE HEARD IN PUBLIC TODAY. CAN I ASK YOU JUST ONE ON ONE THING WHICH IS. TO EXPAND A LITTLE BIT ON YOUR STATEMENT ABOUT DISADVANTAGED IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND PRIORITIES AROUND -- ACCESSIBILITY FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY CAN YOU TALK JUST A LITTLE BIT BRIEFLY ABOUT MORE OF YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW TO MAKE THAT. THIS IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR US IN EVERY POGRAM WE OPERATE WE HAD ACTUALLY BRIEFING ON AT OUR COMMISSION MEETING THIS MORNING -- EVEN OUR DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS FOR R. D. 35% OF THOSE HAVE BEEN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES -- AND WE DO A LOT OF OUR REACH YOU KNOW THE NEW SOLAR HOMES PROGRAM HOW TO CARVE OUT FOR FOR LOW INCOME AND AND MANY PROGRAMS ARE SET UP THAT WAY. GIVE A TASK FORCE IT'S JUST FOCUSED ON OUTREACH FOR OUR PROGRAMS. I WILL SAY IT WITH AN ISSUE LIKE EFFICIENCY. EFFICIENCY ITSELF WHEN WE ADOPT NEW CODES AND STANDARDS AND AND BUILD EFFICIENT BUILDINGS. THE BENEFITS OF THAT A CREW. ESPECIALLY TO DESERVE AS COMMITTEES BECAUSE UTILITY BILLS ARE A LARGER SHARE OF THEIR ANNUAL INCOME AND YOU LOOK AT FOR EXAMPLE AT THE FAULTS RAID. A HOMEOWNER DEFAULTS VERY OFTEN -- AND BOBBY INMAN I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS QUITE A BIT YOU KNOW. THE HOMEOWNER CAN AFFORD TO PAY THE MORTGAGE BUT NOT THE MORTGAGE PLUS THE ENERGY BILL THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STAYING HOME AND NOT SO WE TAKE THE STUFF REALLY SERIOUSLY -- AND IT'S IT'S REALLY AT THE TOP OF OUR MIND AS WE APPROACH ALL THESE ISSUES. THANK YOU. I'M GONNA ASK MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ARE WHO ARE HERE IN SUPPORT TO LINE UP AT THE MICROPHONE. AND GIVEN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE HERE AND THE NUMBER OF ITEMS WE HAVE I WOULD ASK YOU. TO BE INCREDIBLY BRIEF IN YOUR COMMENTS BUT GIVE US YOUR NAME WHO YOU REPRESENT. AND YOUR POSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU WELCOME. I'M BOB BREMER SENIOR ENGINEER WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION I'VE ALSO BEEN ASKED TO GIVE A ME TOO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT IN US. SOCIO ASIAN ARE THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS PROPERTIES ASSOCIATION AND A SPECIFIC LAW -- ISSUE THAT WE WORKED ON TOGETHER -- WAS THE NEW SOLAR HOMES PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM -- WITHIN A THREE YEAR PERIOD AS WE WERE COMING OUT OF THE DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY WE WENT FROM A SOLAR PENETRATION -- IN NEW HOMES FROM LESS THAN 1% WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION IN IN GOING FORWARD WITH THE SOLAR MANDATE THAT TOOK US ABOUT FIVE YEARS TO REACH AGREEMENT ON WE THANK YOU FOR COMING. THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KENT LEACOCK ON THE SENIOR DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AND PUBLIC POLICY FOR PRO TERRA.

NOW WE HAVE TWO MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND CREATED HUNDREDS. OF JOBS AND WE'RE DRIVING INNOVATION IN THE ZERO EMISSION TRANSIT BUS SECTOR AS WELL AS TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER SO I WANTED TO SAY THAT WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT HIS APPOINTMENT AS CHAIR OF THE COMMISSION THANK YOU THANK YOU. WELCOME THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS JASON OCCURRED WITH THAT'LL STING GO OVER ROPES AND SMITH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION.

GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION I'M THERE LI MEI FROM THE CITY OF FREMONT. AND SO CERTAINLY VERY PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF CHAIR HOOKS CHILD. SAILED ON FOR HIS WORK WITH OUR CITY AND THE PARTNERSHIP AS HE MENTIONED -- TESLA IS IN THE PROCESS OF EXPANDING AND THOSE TYPES OF EFFORTS WE APPRECIATE THE PARTNERSHIP AND A PARTICULAR MOST RECENTLY AND SOME LIGHT OF SOME OF THE NATURAL DISASTERS THAT SO MANY CITIES AND FACING TO BE PREPARED. AND THESE PUBLIC SAFETY AND NEEDS SO SUCH AS THAT PROJECT THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT WITH THREE OF OUR ELEVEN FIRE STATIONS TO BE ABLE TO MICROGRAMS. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US AND WITH THEIR DISCUSSION I WAS LISTENING TO YOUR QUESTIONS REGARDING. MAKING SURE THAT HOW DO WE GET ET ADOPTION THE FACT THAT WE'RE BUILDING IS INFRASTRUCTURES AND WE'RE ALSO DOING THAT NEXT LEVEL. EVEY CHARGERS TESTING IN FREMONT OTHERS ARE ALL OPERATIONS THAT WE CAN PUT PARTNER AND THAT THAT ENCOURAGES OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO ADOPT THE TECHNOLOGY AND WE HAVE THE MOST EVEY DRIVERS PER ANNE'S OF CODE IN CALIFORNIA SO I THINK THIS IS WORKING FOR US AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP WITH XEROX TO THANK YOU. WELCOME HI MY NAME IS LAUREN OF OUR OVERMAN VERY MENTAL DEFENSE FIND HERE AND SUPPORT WE THINK THAT -- KRISTER HAWK SHE'LL IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST PERSON FOR THE JOB HE AS THAT COMMITMENT ABILITY IN THE VISION TO GET THIS DONE SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MY NAME IS STAN GRESHAM A GOOD ALTERNATIVE I ALSO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING AS A AS THE VICE CHAIR OF THE CDC'S DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ADVISOR GROUP -- WERE REVISED BUT THE P. PCNC SEE ON THEIR PROGRAMS AND HOW THEY'RE IMPACTING LOW INCOME DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES -- I CAN SAY FROM. MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE BOTH IN THE COMMISSIONERS. ARE FOR YOUR CURRENT ROLE BUT IN HIS PREVIOUS LIVES AS WELL HE'S A STRONG ADVOCATE. FOR A CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION THAT IS INCLUSIVE OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ON LOW INCOME FAMILIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE URBAN COASTAL RURAL. CALIFORNIA SO WE SO I ASSUME IS PART OF HIS REAPPOINTMENT. THANK YOU. I'M SURE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MATTHEW SANDERS I'M AT THE PACIFIC OCEAN ENERGY TRUST ALSO KNOWN AS POET -- WERE A ORGANIZATION THAT SUPPORTS OFFSHORE NOBLE ENERGY ALONG THE WEST COAST WE'RE HERE IN SUPPORT OF COMMISSION HOPE SHIELDS.

AS THE COMMISSION ALSO HAS A TRACK RECORD SO THIS IS A VERY EASY CHOICE AND WE COMMEND HIS CONFIRMATION. THANK YOU. I'M CHAIR MEMBERS ARE MORE THERE HAPPENS TALK WITH THE CALIFORNIA PATIENTS IN DEMAND MANAGEMENT COUNCIL I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF WORKING WITH CHAIR HAWK SHIELD FOR OVER A DECADE AND A VARIETY OF CAPACITIES. I CAN ASURE YOU THERE IS NO ONE WHO IS MORE DEDICATED TO A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE FOR CALIFORNIA OR FOR SHOWING THE CALIFORNIA LEADS THE WAY IN THE STAB WISHING THAT CLEAN ENERGY AND A GROWING ECONOMY GO HAND IN HAND. HE IS THE RIGHT LEADER AT THE RIGHT TIME WE THANK YOU THANK YOU PLEASE CONFIRM. JAMIE MINOR ON BEHALF OF MC MARIN CLEAN ENERGY THE STATE'S FIRST CCA IN SUPPORT OF HIS CONFIRMATION TODAY APPRECIATE HIS LEADERSHIP BUT AS IT COMES. BOB PROCUREMENT OF RENEWABLES AND ESPECIALLY ENSURING THAT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN LOW INCOME RIGHT PAIRS AREN'T LEFT BEHIND THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MARK FENSTER MAKER FOR PENINSULA CLEAN ENERGY WERE THE CCA IN SAN MATEO COUNTY WE'RE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF COMMISSIONER HOCHSCHILD CONFIRMATION TODAY. HE'S ALWAYS BEEN AN INNOVATIVE AND THOUGHTFUL LEADER WHEN IT HEARING THAT HERE TODAY AS HE TALKS ABOUT HOW CLEAN ENERGY CAN BILL CLIMATE RESILIENCE WHICH WE CERTAINLY KNOW. WE NOW NEED GOING FORWARD THANK YOU THANK YOU. HELLO SHARON COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ALLEY TEACHER AND I'M WITH ANGIE WERE GLOBAL CLEAN ENERGY DEVELOPER IN CALIFORNIA WE FOCUS ON EFFICIENCY SOLAR STORAGE IN MICROGRAMS. I'M WITH THE COMMISSIONER HOOK SHOWS A GREAT LEADER AND CHAMPION FOR INNOVATION ESPECIALLY AS WE LOOK TO DO THINGS LIKE RENEWABLE HYDROGEN CONTINUING MICROGRAPHS. AND IN A AND BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY [inaudible] BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY. THANK YOU THANK YOU -- MATT FREEDMAN ON BEHALF OF THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF COMMISSIONER HOPE SHIELDS CONFIRMATION -- I HAD THE PLEASURE TO WORK WITH COMMISSIONER HELP SHIELD FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS.

ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE TODAY TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF HIS CONFIRMATION INDICATES THE FACT THAT HE WORKS WELL WITH A VARIETY OF STAKE HOLDERS HE TREATS EVERYBODY WITH INCREDIBLE RESPECT. PROMOTE CIVIL DIALOGUE. NOT ONLY REACHES OUT TO STAKE HOLDERS REALLY MAKES AN INCREDIBLE EFFORT TO INCLUDE EVERYBODY IN THE PROCESS AND THAT'S FROM THE STAFF WORKING AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION TO THE STAKEHOLDERS PARTICIPATING IN THE PROCEEDINGS IN FRONT OF THE ENERGY COMMISSION -- GROUPS THAT OPPOSE HIM AND GROUPS THAT SUPPORT WHAT HE'S DOING. HE'S DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB OVERSEEING THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD PROGRAM AND THE POWER SOURCE DISCLOSURE PROGRAM AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN VERY MINDFUL OF THE IMPACT OF THESE POLICIES ON AFFORDABILITY FOR LOW AND MODERATE INCOME CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS.

TO OPEN MY STATEMENT WITH JUST A LITTLE BACKGROUND. ON MY CAREER. IF I MAY UP BECAUSE I THINK IT WILL HELP YOU ALL -- UNDERSTAND THE WAY IN WHICH I'M GONNA ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE FOR ME. I HAD. THE FORTUNE OF GROWING UP IN CALIFORNIA IN THE SANTA CLARA VALLEY AND MY FAMILY DID A LOT OF CAMPING AND FISHING THEN. I'M ALWAYS HAD INTEREST IN BEING IN THE FOREST. AND WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE ACCEPTED INTO CAL'S FORESTRY PROGRAM BACK IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR SEVENTY FIVE AND I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE OF HAVING. DR HAROLD BUILDS WELL AS MY ADVISER AT THE TIME AND AFTER MY FRESHMAN YEAR AT ACTUALLY IT WAS SECOND QUARTER. AND I I REALIZE JEEZ I'VE BEEN AND I'VE GOT A WHOLE NOTHER YEAR AHEAD OF ME OF PRETTY MUCH OF PRE MED [inaudible] TRAINING. AND I HAD THE SPRING BURNED OUT BLUES AND I WENT IN AND TALKED TO HERALD. HE SAID YOU KNOW. I HAVE A GRAD STUDENT WORKING UP IN YOSEMITE DOING HIS PHD WORK. IN PRESCRIBED BURNING AND HE NEEDS IN THE SYSTEM. IF YOU WOULD. BE WILLING TO TAKE YOUR SPRING QUARTER. UP AND WORK WITH HIM I WILL. GIVE YOU A YOU KNOW WHAT I FORGET WHAT THEY CALLED IT AT THE TIME IT WAS [inaudible] I COULD. GET CREDIT BUT NOT A FULL QUARTERS WERE THE CREDIT AND I WENT UP THERE AND WORKED WITH THIS FELLA YON VAN WEIGHTON DONG. WHO EVENTUALLY BECAME THE RESEARCH BIOLOGIST FREE SEVENTY PARK? AND WE SPENT DAYS OUT PUTTING THEM PLOTS AND THEN TORCHING THEM. AND I LEARNED THE SCIENTIFIC PROCESS FROM HIM BUT THAT CEMENTED MY CAREER AS A FORESTER. AND I WAS HOOKED [inaudible] AND THEN. I MOVED TO SANTA CRUZ AND SO HUNG OUT A BIG CREEK UNTIL THEY GOT TIRED OF STEPPING OVER ME AND THEY EVENTUALLY HIRED ME BUT YET. IN THAT SHORT PERIOD OF TIME I WAS AT CAL FIRE FIRE FIGHTER. AND AND THEN WENT ON AFTER TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND AND WENT TO WORK FOR MEDICINE -- REDWOOD COMPANY SO I'VE HAD A BACKGROUND OF WORKING WITH SMALL NON INDUSTRIAL LANDOWNERS IN THE SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS. AND THEN WORKING FOR A BIG COMPANY. WITH. PRIVATE LAND HOLDINGS AND SAWMILLS. AND I IT IT REALLY DOES SHAPE THE WAY I THINK ABOUT THINGS. SO WITH THAT I WOULD I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO SAY I AM VERY VERY GRATEFUL TO BE APPOINTED. BY THE GOVERNOR AND THE PASS GOVERNOR -- I AM. QUITE CERTAIN THAT. WE HAVE VERY MANY CHALLENGES AHEAD OF US AND A AS A BOARD. BUT I WILL TELL YOU ALL THAT I WILL WORK DILIGENTLY. TO GET THE WORK DONE THAT IS BEFORE US. SENATOR MINING LET ME START WITH YOU THIS TIME. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. IN A WELCOME CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT. THANK YOU YOU HAD ME WITH UC BERKELEY. GO BEARS -- BUT WE'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF KNOWING EACH OTHER. THROUGH RECENT YEARS -- MICHAEL IS A CONSTITUENT WHEN HE'S HOME IN SANTA CRUZ IN A SURFER. BUT I'VE KNOWN YOU IN YOUR PROFESSIONAL CAPACITY IS A FOR STERN A MANAGEMENT OF LARGE FORESTRY IN HELPING. TO BE A LEADER IN -- I WOULD SAY CULTURE CHANGE IN FOREST MANAGEMENT OF LEARNING IN LEADING A PROCESS THAT'S POST GOOD. FOR THE FORESTRY INDUSTRY AND GOOD FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT AND ECOLOGY AND I THINK YOU AN APOLOGY FOR THAT LEADERSHIP. WITH RESPECT TO THIS POSITION -- YOU REFERENCED BIG CHALLENGES AS GOVERNOR BROWN SAID WE'RE LIVING IN A NEW ABNORMAL WITH CLIMATE CHANGE IN. FIRE SEASONS BEING EXTENDED. QWERTY WITH WITH THE THE BREADTH OF THESE CHALLENGES. WHERE WHERE OUR ENERGIES BEST DIRECTED I KNOW THERE'S NOT A SINGLE FIX BUT WE HAVE THE INTERFACE BETWEEN? POPULATED AREAS SOME WILD FIRE AREAS WE HAVE LARGE FORCE MANY OF WHICH ARE US FORESTRY. MANAGED OM WHERE DO WE FIND THAT BALANCE AS YOU MOVE FORWARD -- WHERE DO YOU WANT TO SEE THE STATE PUT ITS ATTENTION? IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO DO A MULTI PRONGED ATTACK AT THIS WE WON'T GET THE WORK DONE THAT WE NEED TO DO OTHERWISE FIRST WE HAVE TO ENGAGE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THEY CONTROL A LOT OF FOREST LAND. IN THE STATE. THE SECOND IS WE HAVE TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE IN TWO FORMS. WE DON'T HAVE THE INDUSTRY THAT WE ONCE HAD HERE IN CALIFORNIA OF TRAINED WORKERS TO GO OUT AND DO THE KIND OF WORK. THAT AT LEAST PART OF THE EQUATION IS ACTUALLY GETTING ON THE LANDSCAPE. AND DOING THINGS MUSICALLY WITH THE FOREST. SO GETTING PROGRAMS RESTARTED I THINK WORKING WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO BRING PEOPLE INTO OUR INDUSTRY. IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL I THINK CAL FIRE IS MADE SOME INCREDIBLY GREAT STEPS RECENTLY. OF GETTING PEOPLE INTO TRAINING PROGRAMS. BROAD VARIETY OF TRAINING. THAT WILL HELP THAT ALONG. THEN THE OTHER HARD INVESTMENT IN EQUIPMENT THAT IS NECESSARY TO DO THE WORK -- AND ALSO AGAIN CHARLIE. BUILDING BACK INFRASTRUCTURE HARD IN THE STRUCTURE MILLS. COGENERATION PLANTS THAT SHOULD FOLD INTO THE RENEWABLE WINDOW -- IS THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE. SOME. GUARANTEES AT LEAST. POLICY GUARANTEES THAT THE MATERIAL THAT WILL RUN THOSE FACTORIES AND HIRE THOSE PEOPLE. IS GOING TO BE THEIR LONG TERM AND NOT JUST A SHORT SPLASH IN THE PAN. SO THERE'S THAT ONCE WE GET THAT ESTABLISH I THINK [inaudible] THEN. THE THE WORK. ON THE LANDSCAPE. WILL ACCELERATES SLOWLY IT'LL BE SUBSIDIZED EARLY ON BY THE STATE BUT I THINK PRIVATE CAPITAL WILL COME INTO PLAY. THANK YOU AND THEN. AND JUST A FINAL QUESTION FOR ME I KNOW THAT THE BOARD STAFF HAS OVERSIGHT OF WORKING WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN REVIEWING. LOCAL PLANS -- FOR WILD FIRE SAFETY AND PROTECTION BUT NO AUTHORITY FOR IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT OR MAY BE FINE TUNING THOSE PLANS HOW. HOW DO YOU SEE THAT STATE OF PLAY IN? DO YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY NECESSARY. TO ACHIEVE MAXIMUM ANA LOCAL. INVOLVEMENT. WE HAVE WE HAVE THE OVERSIGHT. OF THE LOCAL PLANS. WE CAN MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS. BUT THEY DON'T ALWAYS HAVE. TO TAKE THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MAY. I WOULD BE HESITANT AT THIS POINT IN TIME. TO USE THE STICK. VERSUS THE CARROT. AND SO I THINK AGAIN WITH SOME EDUCATION. I'M AND WITH THE INCREDIBLE STAFF THAT WE HAVE AT THE BOARD OF FORESTRY. THAT INTERFACES WITH COUNTIES IN PLANNING DEPARTMENTS -- INCENTIVIZING. THINGS THAT THEY SHOULD SUPPORT. AND PUT INTO CODE IS THE BEST METHOD RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK AS WE DISCUSSED. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE EVERY. SELF INTEREST AT THIS POINT IN TRYING TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THEIR COMMUNITY SO. SOUNDS LIKE IT IS A PARTNERSHIP -- MOVING FORWARD. ON I THINK THAT'S GOOD. MADAM CHAIR JUST APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS. TO ADD THIS TO YOUR CONTINUED PORTFOLIO OF WORK IN OUR FORESTS AND FIRE SAFETY I HAVE THE TIME TO DO IT NOW. AND I'M REALLY HAPPY TO BE. ABLE TO DO IT AND HAVE THE SUPPORT OF MY MY EMPLOYERS. RIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU AND GOD AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS A REAPPOINTMENT AS REALLY ARE. THEY YOU KNOW THAT'S A CONFIRMATION THAT WHAT'S GONE BEFORE WE WANT TO RETAIN IT BECAUSE IT WAS VERY HIGH QUALITY SO. ODD THAT CERTAINLY YOUR RESUME I HAVE. I BELIEVE YOU ALL HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB AT LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL -- UP TO THIS POINT AND I KNOW THERE'S A STATEWIDE VEGETATION TREATMENT PROGRAM THAT'S IN THE WORKS IN MY COMMUNITY OF ALL SOUTH ORANGE OUNTY YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER SOME OF THE PRETTY. HORRIFIC FIRES THAT OCCURRED THERE -- MID TWO THOUSAND SOLD MY MY INDIVIDUAL -- HOME. A COMMUNITY LAGUNA MIGUEL WE HAVE A FUEL -- MANAGEMENT PLAN IS SO WE WE HAVE TO HAVE A FUEL MODIFICATION AS PART OF ANY DEVELOPMENT. AND THAT WAS THE COUNTY -- WHEN WE WERE PRE INCORPORATION AND THEN IT CAME FORWARD WITH OUR INCORPORATION SO IS WORKED VERY WELL OUR HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS ARE HAVE TO BUY INTO THAT WITH THE C. C. AN ARSENAL LONG SO? IT'S A GREAT MODELING YOU PROBABLY. KNOW ABOUT IT HI CERTAINLY WITH THE PASSION THAT YOU HAVE THAT GOES BACK TO CHILDHOOD YOU ARE YOU ARE FORCED MAN SO. ARE YOU CERTAINLY ARE GOING TO HAVE MY SUPPORT BUT YOU MIGHT WANT TO JUST SHARE IN IT WHEN THE VEGETATION TREATMENT PLAN IS IN THE WORKS AND WHEN IT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE FOR COMMUNITIES THAT. CAN IN IN REALLY RIGHT I'D LIKE TO SAY YOU ENJOY THE BEST PRACTICES THAT ARE IN THERE AND VERY WELL RECEIVED BY. OUR RESIDENTS. I DON'T HAVE A FIRM TIMELINE WINDS THAT WILL ACTUALLY BE. OUT AND USABLE. I'M IT. IT'S GONE THROUGH. A LOT OF CHANGES OVER THE YEARS IT'S BEEN CHALLENGED IN COURT AND I THINK THEY'RE WELL AWARE OF THE COMMENTS THAT CAME IN THE LAST TIME. WE AND THIS WAS BEFORE I WAS ON THE BOARD. YOU KNOW TRIED TO GET IT IN PLACE BUT ONCE IN PLACE I THINK IT WILL BE THE ROAD MAP FOR ALL OF THE VARIOUS COMMUNITIES. AND THAT THE OTHER GOOD THING IS THAT WE UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE LEARNED. OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST TWO YEARS. ABOUT THE SEVERITY. OF FIRES THAT INNER COMMUNITIES THAT. WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T AND CERTAINLY THOSE ITEMS WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THAT AS WELL AND SHARE? IT WITH THANK YOU I JUST ONE NOW SOME FINAL COMMENT WITHOUT DOUBT PRESENT IN SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY IF YOU REMEMBER THE LAGUNA FIRE. MANY YEARS AGO IT WOULD HAVE JUMPED A LEASE -- CANYON WHICH IS HE RUNS DOWN TO THE BEACH IN LAGUNA BEACH AND BECAUSE WE HAD FUEL MODIFICATION GOING ON AT THAT TIME IT DID NOT LEAVE THAT CREEK. IF IT HAD IT COULD REALLY ARE TAKEN OUT A HUGE PORTION OF THE COASTAL AREA OF LAGUNA BEACH LAGUNA GAL DATA POINT. RIGHT ACROSS THE HIGHWAY THERE SO I'M CERTAINLY A STRONG SUPPORTER AND I HAVE IT ON MY BACKYARD. AND ON SUNDAYS I WISH I COULD PUT A LITTLE MORE SOMETHING OUT THERE AND THEN I THINK -- NO. FINE TO HAVE JUST THE THE KIND OF SCRIPT DOES ALLOW THEIR THEN SOMETHING THAT IS COMBUSTIBLE BECAUSE THAT WOULD SWEEP UP. CERTAINLY VERY QUICKLY AND I THINK ALL OF US HAVE EMBRACED THAT SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK. AND YOU CERTAINLY HAVE MY SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
