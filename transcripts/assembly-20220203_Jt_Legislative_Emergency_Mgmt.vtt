HEARING TODAY. WE'RE GONNA BE

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:55.174
LOOKING. AT A NEW AREA THAT

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:57.243
THIS. LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE ON

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.379
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT HAS NOT

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:01.948
TACKLE BEFORE. WE'VE TAKEN A

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:03.750
LOOK IN OUR PREVIOUS HEARING AT

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:05.785
THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY WRIT LARGE

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:07.520
AND SEVERAL CHALLENGES TO

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:08.421
BUILDING A JUST FORM OF

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:10.390
RESILIENCE. THAT LOOKS AFTER THE

00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:12.258
PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE

00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:15.128
DURING THE DISASTERS THAT. SEEM

00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:15.595
TO CHALLENGE OUR STATE

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:18.364
CONSTANTLY. AND THEN I GUESS IS

00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:23.102
THE CHALLENGE OF THIS ELEMENT OF

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:24.704
THE CRIME EMERGENCY WE'RE

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:25.805
EXPLORING TODAY WHICH IS THE

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:28.241
TOPIC OF EXTREME HEAT. WE ARE

00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:30.977
NOT IN A DROUGHT. WE ARE NOT IN

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:33.313
A SERIES OF HEAT WAVES WE ARE IN

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.548
A GREAT DRYING AND REDUPLICATION

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:38.585
OF THE WEST MODELS INDICATE THAT

00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:40.787
TEMPERATURES WILL CLIMB OVER THE

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:44.290
COMING DECADES. INTO INTO AREAS

00:03:44.357 --> 00:03:46.192
THAT WE HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:48.227
BEFORE AND IT WILL BE DEAD. THE

00:03:48.294 --> 00:03:50.296
QUESTION IS CAN WE MITIGATE

00:03:50.363 --> 00:03:53.166
THESE IMPACTS NOW AND DEAL WITH

00:03:53.232 --> 00:03:54.100
THESE EMERGENCIES BEFORE THEY

00:03:54.167 --> 00:03:56.836
START. COURTNEY LUSKIN CENTER AN

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:58.638
INNOVATION OUT OF UCLA

00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:00.974
CALIFORNIANS ARE NOT JUST SEEING

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.441
THESE HIGHER AVERAGE

00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:03.443
TEMPERATURES. BUT THE SEVERE

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:05.445
HEAT WAVES AND HEAT EXPOSURE

00:04:05.511 --> 00:04:07.680
THAT COMES WITH THEM WILL BE ONE

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:08.648
OF THE GREATEST PHYSICAL AND

00:04:08.715 --> 00:04:11.084
MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES OF THE

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.786
COMING DECADES. THEY ARRIVE IN

00:04:13.853 --> 00:04:15.188
ACUTE AND CHRONIC WAYS AND IT'S

00:04:15.254 --> 00:04:17.523
OFTEN HIDDEN. IT'S A HOT DAY

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.891
IT'S A HUNDRED TWENTY DEGREES IN

00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.593
THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. AND YOU

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.029
THINK HOW UNCOMFORTABLE I HAVE

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:25.031
TO STAY INSIDE. FIND THAT AIR

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:26.733
CONDITIONER MAYBE YOU KNOW A

00:04:26.799 --> 00:04:28.801
FRIEND WHO HAS A POOL. TRY TO

00:04:28.868 --> 00:04:29.836
GET THROUGH YOUR DAY AND LAST

00:04:29.902 --> 00:04:31.237
THAT A SEE A ROLL DOWN YOUR

00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:32.739
WINDOWS IF YOU'RE A SENIOR KERR

00:04:32.805 --> 00:04:33.539
ISN'T WORKING AND JUST GET

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:35.274
THROUGH IT. BUT FOR PEOPLE WHO

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:38.745
ARE HOMEBOUND WHO HAVE MEDICAL

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:40.279
ISSUES WHO ARE DEPENDENT ON

00:04:40.346 --> 00:04:43.249
STABLE SUPPLIES OF POWER. WHO

00:04:43.316 --> 00:04:44.717
THEMSELVES CAN'T ALWAYS GET TO A

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:46.386
COOLING CENTER DON'T HAVE A

00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:47.286
FUNCTIONAL AIR CONDITIONING

00:04:47.353 --> 00:04:49.422
UNIT. DON'T HAVE PROPER HEATING

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:51.457
AND COOLING IN THEIR HOME. THESE

00:04:51.524 --> 00:04:52.925
INCIDENTS ARE DEADLY AND WE'RE

00:04:52.992 --> 00:04:54.827
GONNA EXPLORE IN MORE DETAIL THE

00:04:54.894 --> 00:04:57.497
HIDDEN HUMAN COST OF THE EXTREME

00:04:57.563 --> 00:04:59.065
HEAT. WAIVE THAT IS GOING TO BE

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:00.633
FACING OUR STATE AS AN

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.402
EMERGENCY. AND ONE THAT REALLY

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:04.370
DOESN'T CEASE AND I THINK THAT'S

00:05:04.437 --> 00:05:05.071
ONE OF THE CENTRAL TENSION

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:06.339
POINTS WERE GOING TO.

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:08.908
INTERROGATE TODAY. IS THAT

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:11.878
DURING A FIRE WE HAVE. UNIFIED

00:05:11.944 --> 00:05:13.579
COMMAND THE KIDS ENACTED-

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:15.481
HURRICANE HITS. OR EVEN- TIDAL

00:05:15.548 --> 00:05:18.051
WAVE. THIS IS THE WORK THAT OUR

00:05:18.117 --> 00:05:20.453
FIRST RESPONDERS DEAL WITH. IN

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.754
FLOOD CONDITIONS THEY DECLARE

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:23.356
STATE OF EMERGENCY IN A UNIFIED

00:05:23.423 --> 00:05:25.124
COMMAND CENTERS ESTABLISHED.

00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:28.761
INCIDENT COMMAND IS ALIGNED AND

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:30.863
- PEOPLE AND AGENCIES. ALIGN

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.066
THEMSELVES AND THEY DO THAT KIND

00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:35.234
OF PLANNING AND RESPONSE THAT WE

00:05:35.301 --> 00:05:37.704
EXPECT DURING A CRISIS- THERE

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.673
ARE NO LINES BUREAUCRACY DOESN'T

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.341
MATTER THERE OUGHT BE NO TURF.

00:05:42.408 --> 00:05:44.444
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO A CASCADING

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.746
EMERGENCY LIKE EXTREME HEAT OR

00:05:46.813 --> 00:05:48.514
IN CONFLUENCE WITH THE CLIMATE

00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:50.516
EMERGENCY GIVEN ONGOING

00:05:50.583 --> 00:05:52.685
SITUATION WHERE YOU NEED THAT

00:05:52.752 --> 00:05:54.487
SAME UNIFIED COMMAND APPROACH.

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:55.955
BUT EFORE THE BEFORE THE

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:58.024
DISASTER HAPPENS AND I THINK IF

00:05:58.091 --> 00:05:59.325
WE FOUND A WAY TO APPROACH

00:05:59.392 --> 00:06:01.561
HAZARD MITIGATION. HAZARD

00:06:01.627 --> 00:06:04.764
MITIGATION. WHICH HAS BEEN A NEW

00:06:04.831 --> 00:06:05.932
IN AN EVOLVING PLACE FOR FEMA'S

00:06:05.998 --> 00:06:09.402
WORK- NATIONWIDE IN CONGRESS IS

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:10.870
CERTAINLY INVESTED IN THIS SPACE

00:06:10.937 --> 00:06:12.472
ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS. THE

00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:14.140
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN LOOKING AT

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:16.242
MORE THESE PREVENTIVE MEASURES

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:17.777
BUT IF WE CAN START TO GET AHEAD

00:06:17.844 --> 00:06:19.145
. OF THIS DEADLY HEAT WAVE THAT

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:20.847
IT WILL BE WITH US FOR DECADES

00:06:20.913 --> 00:06:22.882
TO COME AND FIND A WAY TO BUILD

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:24.917
RESILIENCE INTO OUR COMMUNITIES.

00:06:24.984 --> 00:06:26.586
WE'RE GOING TO BE SAFER AND

00:06:26.652 --> 00:06:28.554
WE'RE GONNA BE MORE RESILIENT.

00:06:28.621 --> 00:06:29.989
AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:31.924
THOSE LIVES ON OUR HANDS. RIGHT

00:06:31.991 --> 00:06:33.059
NOW A LOT OF US DON'T WANT TO

00:06:33.126 --> 00:06:34.761
PAY ATTENTION TO THE NUMBERS. WE

00:06:34.827 --> 00:06:36.295
DON'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR

00:06:36.362 --> 00:06:38.598
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING. AND WE

00:06:38.664 --> 00:06:39.732
DON'T EVEN WANT TO COUNT THEM.

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:42.101
AND THAT'S A PROBLEM SO I'M

00:13:57.303 --> 00:13:58.704
THERE'S TWO THINGS THERE'S AN

00:13:58.771 --> 00:13:59.905
INDIVIDUAL COMPONENT AND

00:13:59.972 --> 00:14:01.440
RESPONSIBILITY TO THAT THERE'S

00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:03.175
ALSO GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITY

00:14:03.242 --> 00:14:06.212
AND- PART OF THAT INDIVIDUAL

00:14:06.278 --> 00:14:07.246
RESPONSIBILITY IS KNOWING YOUR

00:14:07.313 --> 00:14:09.715
OWN- SITUATIONS AND PLANNING FOR

00:14:09.782 --> 00:14:11.483
THAT AHEAD OF TIME. THE

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.786
GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITY IS TO

00:14:13.852 --> 00:14:15.988
HELP RAISE AWARENESS OF COURSE-

00:14:16.055 --> 00:14:18.357
SO THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT- IS

00:14:18.424 --> 00:14:19.225
THAT SOMETHING THAT THEY NEED TO

00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:21.126
PLAN FOR. BUT IT'S ALSO TO

00:14:21.193 --> 00:14:23.796
ENSURE THAT THE BASIC THINGS

00:14:23.862 --> 00:14:25.297
THAT THEY NEED TO DEAL WITH

00:14:25.364 --> 00:14:27.900
EXTREME HEAT ARE AVAILABLE WHEN

00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:30.569
THEY NEED IT. ENSURING WATER

00:14:30.636 --> 00:14:32.538
SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION.

00:14:32.605 --> 00:14:34.306
OBVIOUSLY IS A FIREFIGHTER I

00:14:34.373 --> 00:14:36.075
GUESS WHAT WE BATTLE HEAT WITH

00:14:36.141 --> 00:14:37.776
WE DO HAVE A LITTLE WITH WATER.

00:14:37.843 --> 00:14:39.545
AND SO ENSURING A WATER SUPPLY

00:14:39.612 --> 00:14:40.846
SO PEOPLE CAN USE THAT FOR

00:14:40.913 --> 00:14:42.848
COOLING MEASURES WHEN THEY NEED

00:14:42.915 --> 00:14:44.683
IT AND THE DISTRIBUTION. ARM AND

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:47.987
THAT- THAT THAT ENCOMPASSES

00:14:48.053 --> 00:14:50.189
EVERYBODY IN THIS STATE- ALSO

00:14:50.256 --> 00:14:51.790
ENSURING ADEQUATE ELECTRICAL

00:14:51.857 --> 00:14:53.792

00:14:53.859 --> 00:14:55.628
THE OTHER COOLING THAT PEOPLE

00:14:55.694 --> 00:14:57.596
TAKE OR IN WHAT THEIR CONDITION

00:14:57.663 --> 00:14:59.565
IS AN ACTOR. ESPECIALLY WHEN WE

00:14:59.632 --> 00:15:01.533
HAVE A HIGH HEAT EVENTS- THAT

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.402
CREATES QUITE A STRAIN ON THE

00:15:03.469 --> 00:15:05.537
CURRENT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. AND

00:15:05.604 --> 00:15:07.906
SO IT'S AND IT'S INCUMBENT ON US

00:15:07.973 --> 00:15:10.009
IN THE GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE THAT

00:15:10.075 --> 00:15:14.213
THOSE SUPPLIES ARE ADEQUATE. AND

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.282
FOR THE MOST EXTREME- TIMES IN

00:15:16.348 --> 00:15:21.654
OUR IN OUR- CYCLE FOR THE YEAR-

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:22.788
I ALREADY TALK ABOUT RAISING

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:25.824
SOMETHING ELSE IT IS IMPORTANT

00:15:25.891 --> 00:15:27.960
FOR US TO DO. BUT ONE OF THE

00:15:28.027 --> 00:15:29.395
MOST IMPORTANT THING IS A

00:15:29.461 --> 00:15:32.164
PROVIDING FOR THOSE THAT CAN'T-

00:15:32.231 --> 00:15:33.766

00:31:04.862 --> 00:31:07.165
SIMILAR ROBERT RIVAS IS WELL AND

WAYS TO USE OUR CARE WORK FORCE.

OVER ARCHING RESILIENCE

00:31:49.607 --> 00:31:52.210

00:43:55.733 --> 00:43:57.801
WHICH EXAMINES COMMUNITY SCALE

00:43:57.868 --> 00:43:59.336
CLIMATE VULNERABILITIES FOR ALL

00:43:59.403 --> 00:44:01.438
CORNERS OF LA. WE'VE SINCE

00:44:01.505 --> 00:44:02.740
COMPLETED THAT ASSESSMENT IN

00:44:02.806 --> 00:44:03.707
PARTNERSHIP WITH SEVERAL OTHER

00:44:03.774 --> 00:44:05.576
ORGANIZATIONS HERE TODAY AND

00:44:05.642 --> 00:44:08.679
I'LL SHARE OUR FINDINGS RELATED

00:44:08.746 --> 00:44:11.315
TO EXTREME HEAT. SO EXTREME HEAT

00:44:11.382 --> 00:44:13.384
WILL HAVE WIDESPREAD EFFECTS ON

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:14.551
PEOPLE AND INFRASTRUCTURE

00:44:14.618 --> 00:44:17.354
INCREASING BOTH IN FREQUENCY AND

00:44:17.421 --> 00:44:19.056
SEVERITY ACROSS L. A. COUNTY

00:44:19.123 --> 00:44:22.593
WITH UP TO A TEN FOLD INCREASE.

00:44:22.659 --> 00:44:24.094
IN THE OCCURRENCE OF HEAT WAVES

00:44:24.161 --> 00:44:26.497
BY MID CENTURY. WE EXPECTS THE

00:44:26.563 --> 00:44:28.665
LARGEST INCREASES IN EXTREME

00:44:28.732 --> 00:44:31.502
HEAT IN THE SANTA CLARITA AND

00:44:31.568 --> 00:44:33.504
SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. NO EXTREME

00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:35.305
HEAT CAN JEOPARDIZE PHYSICAL AND

00:44:35.372 --> 00:44:37.141
MENTAL HEALTH IN MANY WAYS JUST

00:44:37.207 --> 00:44:38.909
SOME EXAMPLES WORSENING

00:44:38.976 --> 00:44:41.011
RESPIRATORY AND HEART CONDITIONS

00:44:41.078 --> 00:44:43.280
AND THAT'S WHY WE AS A COUNTY

00:44:43.347 --> 00:44:46.316
TAKE THIS ISSUE SERIOUSLY. THE

00:44:46.383 --> 00:44:47.851
NEXT THING HE WILL ALSO HAVE

00:44:47.918 --> 00:44:49.853
MONUMENTAL AND COMPLEX IMPACTS

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.755
WERE ENERGY SYSTEM AND OTHER

00:44:51.822 --> 00:44:53.724
PIECES OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

00:44:53.791 --> 00:44:55.492
SAME GONNA FOCUS ON OUR SOCIAL

00:44:55.559 --> 00:44:56.960
VULNERABILITIES TO EXTREME HEAT

00:44:57.027 --> 00:44:58.395
IN OTHER WORDS THE PEOPLE WHO

00:44:58.462 --> 00:44:59.763
WILL BE MOST DISTRESSED BY

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:01.632
EXTREME HEAT. TO DO THAT WE

00:45:01.698 --> 00:45:03.634
CONSIDERED IN OUR REPORT TWENTY

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:04.902
NINE SOCIAL FACTORS WHICH WE

00:45:04.968 --> 00:45:06.870
CROSSWALKS WITH CLIMATE DATA AT

00:45:06.937 --> 00:45:08.672
THE CENSUS TRACTS FAILED TO

00:45:08.739 --> 00:45:11.642
IDENTIFY COMMUNITIES OF CONCERN

00:45:11.708 --> 00:45:12.709
FOR EXTREME HEAT. WE ARE HIGHLY

00:45:12.776 --> 00:45:14.878
CONCERNED ABOUT COMMUNITIES LIKE

00:45:14.945 --> 00:45:17.114
RECEITA AND WINNETKA IN THE SAN

00:45:17.181 --> 00:45:18.715

HOUSEHOLDS IN PEOPLE WITH PRE

00:45:21.852 --> 00:45:23.821
EXISTING HEALTH CONDITIONS. OUR

00:45:23.887 --> 00:45:24.455
REPORT ALSO HIGHLIGHTED

00:45:24.521 --> 00:45:27.224
MONTEBELLO. WHICH IS AT RISK OF

00:45:27.291 --> 00:45:30.394
EXPOSURE TO EXTREME HEAT PLUS.

00:45:30.461 --> 00:45:32.262
COPULATION IS MADE UP OF A HIGH

00:45:32.329 --> 00:45:32.996
PROPORTION OF PEOPLE WITH

00:45:33.063 --> 00:45:34.431

00:45:39.336 --> 00:45:41.205
WHERE URBAN HEAT ISLAND EFFECT

00:45:41.271 --> 00:45:43.474
CAN MAGNIFY IMPACTS EVEN WHEN

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:46.477
THERE IS MODEST INCREASES IN

00:45:46.543 --> 00:45:48.312
REGIONAL TEMPERATURE. THE REPORT

00:45:48.378 --> 00:45:49.813
MAKES CLEAR THAT THERE'S A

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:51.815
DISTINCTLY RACIALIZED ASPECTS TO

00:45:51.882 --> 00:45:53.817
CLIMB UPON ABILITIES IN MANY

00:45:53.884 --> 00:45:55.185
CASES. THE FOR EXTREME HEAT WE

00:45:55.252 --> 00:45:57.654
FOUND THAT LATINOS MAKE UP 49%

00:45:57.721 --> 00:45:59.890
OF LA COUNTY'S POPULATION THAT

00:45:59.957 --> 00:46:01.892

HEAT. WE HAVE SIXTY SEVEN. OF

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:08.632
THE POPULATION. SO THAT MEANS

00:46:08.699 --> 00:46:10.601
BUT THEN ALSO BEAR THE BRUNT OF

00:46:10.667 --> 00:46:15.038

DRASTIC RICE. LASTLY WE NEED TO

00:50:29.559 --> 00:50:31.061
APPLY A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH

00:50:31.128 --> 00:50:32.929
TO EXTREME HEAT THIS APPROACH

00:50:32.996 --> 00:50:34.398
WILL LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT HOW

00:50:34.464 --> 00:50:36.032
SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH

00:50:36.099 --> 00:50:37.968
FACTOR INTO VULNERABILITY AND

00:50:38.034 --> 00:50:40.070
RESILIENCE WORKERS ARE AT RISK

00:50:40.137 --> 00:50:42.806

EXAMPLE MANY WORKERS LIVE IN

00:50:46.209 --> 00:50:48.412
URBAN AREAS ARE ALSO VULNERABLE

00:50:48.478 --> 00:50:50.680

00:51:00.624 --> 00:51:02.159
OR EVEN DEATH DURING EXTREME

00:51:02.225 --> 00:51:04.127
HEAT. ON BEHALF OF THE THAT'S

THAT WE SERVE WE ASK THAT THE

00:51:06.963 --> 00:51:08.131
BURDEN OF CLIMATE CHANGE NOT

00:51:08.198 --> 00:51:10.600
CONTINUE TO FALL UPON ALREADY

00:51:10.667 --> 00:51:12.536
WILL DOUBLE COMMUNITIES BUT

00:51:12.602 --> 00:51:13.804
RATHER THAT WE WORK TOGETHER ON

00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:15.138
A DATING AND BROADENING THE

00:51:15.205 --> 00:51:16.840
RESPONSE TO EXTREME HEAT AND OUR

00:51:16.907 --> 00:51:19.075
STATE. THAT TRULY RESOURCES

00:51:19.142 --> 00:51:20.944
HIGHLY IMPACTED COMMUNITIES WE

WORK WITH JONATHAN PARK FREE ACT

00:52:11.495 --> 00:52:13.430
FINALLY RESOLVED BUT BEFORE I

00:52:13.497 --> 00:52:15.432
WAS WITH CLAMOR RESOLVED I

00:52:15.499 --> 00:52:17.334
WORKED AS THE- AT AN AMAZON

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:19.569
WAREHOUSE IN MORENO VALLEY WHICH

00:52:19.636 --> 00:52:21.438
IS A SMALL CITY IN RIVERSIDE

00:52:21.505 --> 00:52:24.207
COUNTY. AND AS A KICKER I WOULD

00:52:24.274 --> 00:52:27.110
HAVE EXPANDED THAT TIME ME

00:52:27.177 --> 00:52:28.144
EXACTLY WHAT ROLE AND HOW FAR

00:52:28.211 --> 00:52:29.880
DOWN THE ROAD TO GO. TO GET THE

00:52:29.946 --> 00:52:31.548
ITEMS FOR THE ORDER I WAS

00:52:31.615 --> 00:52:33.049
DEALING AND LOOKING FLOOR IS

00:52:33.116 --> 00:52:35.018
INCREDIBLY LARGE THERE MUST BE

00:52:35.085 --> 00:52:39.289
AT LEAST A. HUNDRED ROLES THAT

00:52:39.356 --> 00:52:40.357
WE ARE PICKING FROM. AND THE

00:52:40.423 --> 00:52:42.325
TYPE OF CLAIM THAT AMAZON HAD.

00:52:42.392 --> 00:52:44.794
TO US. WHEN IT COMES OF. A

00:52:44.861 --> 00:52:47.531
COUPLE OF. ON EVERY WORLD SO

00:52:47.597 --> 00:52:48.598
THERE WOULD BE TIMES WHEN WE

00:52:48.665 --> 00:52:50.567
WOULD BE PICKING ITEMS. SEVERAL

00:52:50.634 --> 00:52:52.502
MINUTES WITHOUT ANY COOLING AT

00:52:52.569 --> 00:52:54.304
ALL. AND SINCE I WAS WORKING

00:52:54.371 --> 00:52:56.106
THERE DURING THE SUMMER TIMES.

00:52:56.172 --> 00:52:57.240
WHEN I WOULD CLOCK IN THE

00:52:57.307 --> 00:53:00.210
MORNING IT WOULD ALREADY BE WARM

00:53:00.277 --> 00:53:01.378
. AND DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE

00:53:01.444 --> 00:53:04.014
SHIP IT WAS EVEN HOTTER- AND

00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:05.115
THROUGHOUT THE SHIFT FOR

00:53:05.181 --> 00:53:06.516
CONSTANTLY ON THE MOVE AND

00:53:06.583 --> 00:53:08.451
ENCOURAGED TO MOVE FASTER IN

00:53:08.518 --> 00:53:11.187
ORDER TO ME OUR HOURLY RATE- AND

00:53:11.254 --> 00:53:12.522
WE'RE WALKING UP TO SEVERAL

00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:14.858
MILES- IN THE ORKDAY AND THAT

00:53:14.925 --> 00:53:17.727
HE EVENTUALLY STARTS TO GET TO

00:53:17.794 --> 00:53:20.597
YOU. THE PHARMACIST AND THE

00:53:20.664 --> 00:53:22.299
BLOWING HOT AIR BACK TO YOU

00:53:22.365 --> 00:53:23.667
WHICH CAN FEEL WORSE AT TIMES.

00:53:23.733 --> 00:53:24.968
AND THERE WERE MANY TIMES WHEN I

00:53:25.035 --> 00:53:27.203
FELT SO HOT AND UNCOMFORTABLE TO

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:28.939
THE POINT WHERE I FELT DIZZY.

00:53:29.005 --> 00:53:30.540
IT'S SO HOT AND YOU'RE THERE

00:53:30.607 --> 00:53:34.477
FOR. AT LEAST TEN HOURS BECAUSE

00:53:34.544 --> 00:53:35.745
THAT'S THE AVERAGE SHIFT TIME.

00:53:35.812 --> 00:53:37.581
AND THE WAY I DESCRIBE THE HEAT

00:53:37.647 --> 00:53:39.950
AT AMAZON IS IF YOU'RE IF YOU

00:53:40.016 --> 00:53:41.451
IMAGINE YOURSELF SHOPPING AT A

00:53:41.518 --> 00:53:43.219
WAREHOUSE TYPE OF STORES LIKE

00:53:43.286 --> 00:53:45.188
WALMART. BUT WITH NO AIR

00:53:45.255 --> 00:53:46.990
CONDITIONING AND YOU HAVE TO

00:53:47.057 --> 00:53:50.060
MOVE VERY FAST AND YOU'RE STUCK

00:53:50.126 --> 00:53:51.795
THERE FOR A VERY LONG TIME. AND

00:53:51.861 --> 00:53:53.597
WHEN YOU START WORKING AT AMAZON

00:53:53.663 --> 00:53:55.165
THERE ARE VIDEOS ON SAFETY THAT

00:53:55.231 --> 00:53:56.766
YOU HAVE TO WATCH ON HOW TO PICK

00:53:56.833 --> 00:53:59.202
UP THE BOX PROPERLY- BUT THERE

00:53:59.269 --> 00:54:01.771
IS NO INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE

00:54:01.838 --> 00:54:03.039
SYMPTOMS OF HEAT ILLNESS LOOK

00:54:03.106 --> 00:54:05.208
LIKE. OR WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU ARE

00:54:05.275 --> 00:54:07.243
EXPERIENCING THEM ALL THE

00:54:07.310 --> 00:54:09.179
WORKERS HAVE. ARE THOSE SMALL

00:54:09.245 --> 00:54:11.514
FANS ON EVERY OTHER I DON'T.

00:54:11.581 --> 00:54:16.219

AND HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF

00:54:19.489 --> 00:54:21.758
HOURS OF EXPERIENCE INTO. THREE

00:54:21.825 --> 00:54:23.693
SHORT MINUTES- BUT YOUR

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.795
TESTIMONY IS- MAY HAVE BEEN

00:54:25.862 --> 00:54:27.497
BRIEF BUT IT'S WELL HEARD BY THE

00:54:27.564 --> 00:54:28.932

THE COUNTRY JOINING US FROM

00:54:37.741 --> 00:54:39.175
LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LABS-

00:54:39.242 --> 00:54:40.744
RUNNING LEVINSON IS THE LEADER

00:54:40.810 --> 00:54:42.612
OF THE HEAT ISLAND GROUP. AND

00:54:42.679 --> 00:54:46.316
MAX WAY WHO- IS IT NEXT PART ON-

AND UC BERKELEY SAYS A VERY-

00:54:56.159 --> 00:54:59.062
VERY WELCOME- PRESENCE ON OUR

00:54:59.129 --> 00:55:00.830
PANEL HERE TO SEE- WHAT THE

00:55:00.897 --> 00:55:02.365
SMARTEST PEOPLE I KNEW CAL

00:55:02.432 --> 00:55:05.802
DIGGING DEEP INTO THIS COMPLEX

00:55:05.869 --> 00:55:08.538
ISSUE. SO- MISTER LEVINSON YOU

00:55:08.605 --> 00:55:09.773
WANT IT DOCUMENTS AND YOU WANT

00:55:09.839 --> 00:55:11.207
TO GET STARTED HERE AND THEN

00:55:11.274 --> 00:55:12.876
WE'LL TURN IT DR WAY. ABSOLUTELY

00:55:12.942 --> 00:55:14.577
THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE CHAIR

00:55:14.644 --> 00:55:15.779
AND VICE CHAIR YEAH COMMITTEE

00:55:15.845 --> 00:55:18.314
SPEAK TO TODAY. BOB I READ THE

00:55:18.381 --> 00:55:19.115
HEAT ISLAND GROUP THAT WORKS

00:55:19.182 --> 00:55:20.316
BERKELEY NATIONAL LABORATORY

00:55:20.383 --> 00:55:22.719
WHERE WE TRY TO KEEP OUR PEOPLE

00:55:22.786 --> 00:55:24.454
AND OUR BUILDINGS AND WHOLE

00:55:24.521 --> 00:55:29.325
CITIES ARE COOLER IN HOT PLACES

00:55:29.392 --> 00:55:31.027
. TODAY I'D LIKE TO SHARE THREE

00:55:31.094 --> 00:55:33.496
POINTS THE FIRST IS THAT HEAT

00:55:33.563 --> 00:55:35.031
ISLAND COUNTERMEASURES AND THESE

00:55:35.098 --> 00:55:37.400
ARE STEPS LIKE USING COOL ROOFS

00:55:37.467 --> 00:55:40.136
OR MORE RECENTLY COOL WALLS. FOR

00:55:40.203 --> 00:55:42.305
SHADE TREES AND A NUMBER OF

00:55:42.372 --> 00:55:43.940
OTHER THINGS OUGHT THEY WILL

00:55:44.007 --> 00:55:46.543
PROVIDE FAIL SAFE COOLING DURING

00:55:46.609 --> 00:55:47.844
HEATWAVES MEANING THEY DON'T

00:55:47.911 --> 00:55:49.412
DEPEND ON THE AVAILABILITY OF

00:55:49.479 --> 00:55:52.382
ELECTRICITY. AND THEY CAN BE

00:55:52.449 --> 00:55:53.583
FIVE TO TEN TIMES MORE EFFECTIVE

00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:55.618
INDOORS THAN OUTSIDE THESE

00:55:55.685 --> 00:55:57.454
MEASURES ARE GREAT FOR LOWERING

00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:58.488
THE OUTSIDE AIR TEMPERATURE IN

00:55:58.555 --> 00:56:02.192
THE CITY. BUT BECAUSE THEY- ALL

00:56:02.258 --> 00:56:03.960
THE CIRCUS OF OUR HOMES EITHER

00:56:04.027 --> 00:56:05.662
BY REFLECTING MORE SUNLIGHT OR

00:56:05.729 --> 00:56:07.063
PREVENTING SUNLIGHT FROM

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:08.364
REACHING OUR HOMES THROUGH

00:56:08.431 --> 00:56:10.667
SHADE. THEY HAD EVEN GREATER

00:56:10.734 --> 00:56:13.336
BENEFITS AND THIS IS A VERY

00:56:13.403 --> 00:56:15.472
VALUABLE THING BECAUSE OUR HEAT

00:56:15.538 --> 00:56:18.341
WAVES ARE OFTEN COINCIDENT WITH

00:56:18.408 --> 00:56:22.445
POWER FAILURES SO- THAT IT'S THE

00:56:22.512 --> 00:56:24.380
FIRST POINT LIKE TO SHARE. THE

00:56:24.447 --> 00:56:26.983
SECOND IS THAT I WORK A LOT WITH

00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:28.585
THE BUILDING STANDARDS IN

00:56:28.651 --> 00:56:31.121
CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE TITLE

00:56:31.187 --> 00:56:32.255
TWENTY FOUR PART SIX WHICH IS

00:56:32.322 --> 00:56:33.923
OUR ENERGY STANDARD IN TITLE

00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:35.492
TWENTY FOUR PART ELEVEN WHICH

00:56:35.558 --> 00:56:37.360
USE OUR GREEN BUILDING STANDARD.

00:56:37.427 --> 00:56:39.829
THESE ARE EXCELLENT STANDARDS-

00:56:39.896 --> 00:56:42.398
BUT THEY FOCUS ON ENERGY SAVINGS

00:56:42.465 --> 00:56:44.801
CARBON SAVINGS AND COST SAVINGS

00:56:44.868 --> 00:56:48.404
ALL VERY WORTHWHILE OBJECTIVES.

00:56:48.471 --> 00:56:51.007
BUT AS WE ARE DEVELOPING.

00:56:51.074 --> 00:56:54.210
PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS EXTREME HEAT

00:56:54.277 --> 00:56:56.446
THOSE NEED TO BE BASED ON HUMAN

00:56:56.513 --> 00:56:58.047
OUTCOMES AND THAT MEANS THAT

00:56:58.114 --> 00:57:02.152
STANDARDS NEED TO RECOGNIZE THE

00:57:02.218 --> 00:57:05.288
VALUE OF REDUCING DEATH ILLNESS

00:57:05.355 --> 00:57:09.225
AND MISERY. SO WE WANT TO REWARD

00:57:09.292 --> 00:57:12.028
IMPROVEMENTS TO THERMAL COMFORT

00:57:12.095 --> 00:57:14.297
SEVERAL SAFETY TO COMFORT AND TO

00:57:14.364 --> 00:57:17.901
PRODUCTIVITY. AND THE FINAL

00:57:17.967 --> 00:57:21.538
POINT IS WHILE CALIFORNIA IS IN

00:57:21.604 --> 00:57:23.606
THE COMING YEARS GOING TO MISS

00:57:23.673 --> 00:57:25.175
EXTENSIONAL INVESTMENTS TO

00:57:25.241 --> 00:57:27.377
ADDRESS EXTREME HEAT THAT'S NOT

00:57:27.443 --> 00:57:29.879
THE END OF THE STORY AND AS

00:57:29.946 --> 00:57:31.748
CALIFORNIA MAKES INVESTMENTS IN

00:57:31.815 --> 00:57:32.849
THESE PROGRAMS IT SHOULD

00:57:32.916 --> 00:57:34.851
DEDICATE RESOURCES TO MONITORING

00:57:34.918 --> 00:57:37.387
THEIR OUTCOMES. THAT IS TO SAY

00:57:37.453 --> 00:57:39.956
WHAT'S LEARN WHAT WORKS BY

00:57:40.023 --> 00:57:41.991
MEASURING REDUCTIONS IN

00:57:42.058 --> 00:57:43.393
TEMPERATURE SHE STRESSED THE

00:57:43.459 --> 00:57:46.362
ONUS HOSPITALIZATIONS AND DEATHS

00:57:46.429 --> 00:57:48.164
AND WHAT'S- MEASURE THE

00:57:48.231 --> 00:57:50.667
IMPROVEMENTS TO HEALTH COMFORT

00:57:50.733 --> 00:57:53.002
PRODUCTIVITY AND LEARNING AND

00:57:53.069 --> 00:57:55.238
THIS I THINK ARE THE WAYS THAT

00:57:55.305 --> 00:57:58.141
WE CAN TAKE STRONG STEPS TOWARDS

00:57:58.208 --> 00:58:00.310
DEVELOPING EXTREME HEAT

00:58:00.376 --> 00:58:02.679
COUNTERMEASURES THAT ARE WILL

00:58:02.745 --> 00:58:04.714
BENEFIT ALL CALIFORNIANS WILL BE

00:58:04.781 --> 00:58:06.282
EFFECTIVE AND CAN GUIDE OUR

00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:08.952
FUTURE INVESTMENTS. THANK YOU

MODELING A COUPON IN TOOL AND

00:59:13.016 --> 00:59:17.387
PROGRAM RIGHT. SO WE FIND

00:59:17.453 --> 00:59:22.058
SEVERAL CHAEBOL. IN FRESNO IN ON

00:59:22.125 --> 00:59:24.694
FRANCE WHICH ARE DE AREAS OVER

00:59:24.761 --> 00:59:26.763
SEVENTY PER ARE UNCOMFORTABLE

00:59:26.829 --> 00:59:28.197
HOT AT HOME VERY OFTEN DURING

00:59:28.264 --> 00:59:29.632
THE SUMMER AND RESIDENTS ON THE

00:59:29.699 --> 00:59:31.701

00:59:33.970 --> 00:59:35.371
FIFTEEN PERCENT. ARE SPECIALLY

00:59:35.438 --> 00:59:37.073
VULNERABLE THERE A LOT OF OLDER

00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:38.441
INEFFICIENT AIR CONDITIONERS

00:59:38.508 --> 00:59:40.843
THEM UP ON SOME SOFT COOLERS

00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:42.445
WITHOUT IN UNITS WITHOUT

00:59:42.512 --> 00:59:48.251
INTRODUCED. THE FINES MEASURE

ARE PARTICULAR AFFECTED. ON SOME

00:59:50.353 --> 00:59:51.587
OF THE PARA MEASURE ARE STILL

00:59:51.654 --> 00:59:54.123
HERE WINDOW. ROOF INSULATION.

00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:56.492
AND COOL ARE TO BE THE MOST OF

00:59:56.559 --> 00:59:57.894
PASSIVE MEASURES THAT DON'T

00:59:57.961 --> 01:00:00.263

01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:09.605
PAST FOR TOP IN THE- PLOT OF THE

01:00:09.672 --> 01:00:11.541
- WANT TO WHEN THE- OF NEW

01:00:11.607 --> 01:00:13.443
MEXICO TO ME. IN SOUTHWEST

01:00:13.509 --> 01:00:17.213
FRESNO. WHILE I'M ON THE WIRES

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.848
IS A METRIC DISCOMFORT OUR AND

01:00:18.915 --> 01:00:21.551
ON ACCESS IS EACH OF THEM. THAT

01:00:21.617 --> 01:00:23.453
WERE MÀ. THAT'S JUST SHOWING THE

01:00:23.519 --> 01:00:27.423
NATURAL COOL WINDOW FOR ARE. ARE

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:30.560
PROMISING MEASURES. SO IN TERMS

01:00:30.626 --> 01:00:32.662
OF RECORD. THE FIRST IS THE WE

01:00:32.729 --> 01:00:36.399
NEED MORE. EQUITABLE DEFINITIONS

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:37.834
FOR EXTREME HEAT AND HEAT WAVES

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:39.836
SO TWENTY TWENTY ONE THERE WERE

01:00:39.902 --> 01:00:41.604
A RECORD NUMBER OF DAYS GREATER

01:00:41.671 --> 01:00:42.071
THAN A HUNDRED DEGREES

01:00:42.138 --> 01:00:44.741
FAHRENHEIT IN FRESNO AT SIXTY

01:00:44.807 --> 01:00:45.575
NINE WHICH EXCEEDS THE

01:00:45.641 --> 01:00:47.610
PROJECTION FOR TWENTY FORTY

01:00:47.677 --> 01:00:49.145
THEIR NINETEEN HUESO GREATER

01:00:49.212 --> 01:00:50.213
THAN A HUNDRED DEGREES SHOWN

01:00:50.279 --> 01:00:53.216
BELOW. BUT ONLY SIXTEEN OF THE

01:00:53.282 --> 01:00:54.917
SIXTY NINE DAYS OVER CLASSIFIED

01:00:54.984 --> 01:00:56.285
AS EXTREME HEAT DAYS BY THE

01:00:56.352 --> 01:00:57.653
STATE'S DEFINITION OF EXTREME

01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:59.655
HEAT AND ONLY ONE OF THE NINE

01:00:59.722 --> 01:01:01.991
WAVES IS COUNTED AS A HEAT WAVE

01:01:02.058 --> 01:01:03.092
USING THAT EXTREME HEAT

01:01:03.159 --> 01:01:05.561
DEFINITION. EXTREMELY TECH

01:01:05.628 --> 01:01:07.930
THRESHOLD IS A HUNDRED SIX

01:01:07.997 --> 01:01:09.165
DEGREES FAHRENHEIT FRESNO

01:01:09.232 --> 01:01:10.366
INVARIANTS BY CLIMATE IT'S BASED

01:01:10.433 --> 01:01:12.168
ON HISTORICAL NINETIETH

01:01:12.235 --> 01:01:15.405
PERCENTILE. LEVELS SO I THINK WE

01:01:15.471 --> 01:01:16.873
SHOULD CONSIDER ABSOLUTE

01:01:16.939 --> 01:01:18.141
THRESHOLDS IN ADDITION TO

01:01:18.207 --> 01:01:19.675
LOCATION DEPENDENT THRESHOLDS

01:01:19.742 --> 01:01:25.281
FOR EXTREME. HEAT AND HEAT WAVES

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:26.215
. PHAM SECONDLY WE NEED.

01:01:26.282 --> 01:01:28.418

OUR OUR LAWRENCE BERKELEY LABS

01:03:29.238 --> 01:03:31.908
FOLKS- IN TERMS THE HEAT RANKING

01:03:31.974 --> 01:03:33.342
SYSTEM THAT YOU WERE TALKING

01:03:33.409 --> 01:03:36.379
ABOUT AND- ANALYZING HE SORT OF

01:03:36.445 --> 01:03:38.181
OUTSIDE OF THE HOME VERSES IN

01:03:38.247 --> 01:03:40.950
THE HOME- HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY

01:03:41.017 --> 01:03:43.119
FIGURE OUT WHAT. THE TEMPERATURE

01:03:43.186 --> 01:03:45.288
IS INSIDE OF HOMES AND WHERE

01:03:45.354 --> 01:03:46.656
THOSE DISPARITIES ARE

01:03:46.722 --> 01:03:48.491
IDENTIFYING WHERE THEIR SWAMP

01:03:48.558 --> 01:03:51.561
COOLERS OR WHERE THERE ARE NOT

01:03:51.627 --> 01:03:53.563
TEN HOW TO MAP THAT IN A WAY YOU

01:03:53.629 --> 01:03:54.997
MEAN WHEN YOU LOOK AT FOR

01:03:55.064 --> 01:03:55.865
INSTANCE WHAT L. A. COUNTY

01:03:55.932 --> 01:04:00.836
STATED THAT THEY ACHIEVED

01:04:00.903 --> 01:04:01.904
THROUGH THE VULNERABILITY INDEX

01:04:01.971 --> 01:04:03.773
. YOU HAVE THAT FOR YOU ALL WITH

01:04:03.839 --> 01:04:05.608
ENOUGH FOR. TO SEARCH OF. TARGET

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:07.910
THE POPULATIONS THAT THEY WILL

01:04:07.977 --> 01:04:09.278
NEED THAT ASSISTANCE TO THE

01:04:09.345 --> 01:04:11.347
AREAS THAT NEED. MOST URGENTLY

01:04:11.414 --> 01:04:12.648
SAY FOR THE URBAN HEAT ISLAND TO

01:04:12.715 --> 01:04:14.350
BE BROKEN UP OR NEED A COOL ROOF

01:04:14.417 --> 01:04:16.219
RETROFIT OR NEED NEW URBAN

01:04:16.285 --> 01:04:17.720
GREENING OPPORTUNITIES I MEAN.

01:04:17.787 --> 01:04:19.956
TAKE THERE'S LIMITLESS NEED HERE

01:04:20.022 --> 01:04:21.524
BUT IN TERMS OF PRIORITIZATION

01:04:21.591 --> 01:04:24.727
FRAMEWORK AND THE KIND OF DATA

01:04:24.794 --> 01:04:25.795
WE NEED TO COST EFFECTIVELY

01:04:25.861 --> 01:04:28.364
ATTACK THIS PROBLEM HOW DO YOU-

01:04:28.431 --> 01:04:30.967
HOW DO YOU BUILD. ENOUGH

01:04:31.033 --> 01:04:33.402
GRANULARITY TO THE DATA TO MAKE

01:04:33.469 --> 01:04:35.171
SURE WE'RE WE'RE REACHING THE

01:04:35.238 --> 01:04:37.340
PEOPLE WHO NEED IT MOST FIRST.

01:04:37.406 --> 01:04:42.211
WOULD YOU LIKE TO START SURE

01:04:42.278 --> 01:04:44.480
YEAH THAT'S SOME THE GREAT

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:46.582
WESTERN US SENATOR STERN AND I

01:04:46.649 --> 01:04:48.517
THINK HER SEVERAL COMPONENTS OF

01:04:48.584 --> 01:04:49.518
IT SO I'M NOT SURE THAT I COULD

01:04:49.585 --> 01:04:51.254
DO IT JUSTICE MIDDLE TO START

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:54.257
AND THEN- RUNNING CAN RESPOND AS

01:04:54.323 --> 01:04:55.791
WELL SO. I THINK ON THE FIRST

01:04:55.858 --> 01:04:57.293
POINT YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT-

01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:59.395
METRICS AND YOU MENTIONED HE DID

01:04:59.462 --> 01:05:01.230
BACKS THERE'S A HUGE WARNING

01:05:01.297 --> 01:05:02.732
SYSTEM WHICH IS BEING PILOTED BY

01:05:02.798 --> 01:05:06.335
THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE

01:05:06.402 --> 01:05:08.671
THERE'S A LOT OF. NOW SOUP OF.

01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:09.472
METRICS OUT WHICH ARE LOOKING

01:05:09.538 --> 01:05:12.275
OUT OUTDOOR COMFORT OR HELP

01:05:12.341 --> 01:05:14.944
SEATING DECK OR OUTDOOR RISKS TO

01:05:15.011 --> 01:05:16.312
WORKERS. FROM COST IN OUR

01:05:16.379 --> 01:05:19.348
STUDENTS HOURS ON CRISTINA NEXT

01:05:19.415 --> 01:05:20.916
. TO WHERE PALM LOW TEMPERATURE

01:05:20.983 --> 01:05:21.951
WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT

01:05:22.018 --> 01:05:24.020
HUMIDITY SO SOME THERE'S

01:05:24.086 --> 01:05:25.588
TEMPERATURE NUMBER ONE AND THEN

01:05:25.655 --> 01:05:27.423
THERE'S- OTHER METRICS WHICH

01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:29.392
INCLUDE HUMIDITY AND YOU CAN

01:05:29.458 --> 01:05:30.593
ALSO LOOK AT YOUR SPEED. AND

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:33.029
ALSO LIKE A GRADIENT TEMPERATURE

01:05:33.095 --> 01:05:34.163
WHICH IS STILL IN A RADIATION

01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:36.666
FROM OTHER SERVICES. CAN ALSO

01:05:36.732 --> 01:05:38.768
CARRY INSIDE OF THE HOME SO.

01:05:38.834 --> 01:05:39.869
YOU'RE RIGHT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY

01:05:39.935 --> 01:05:41.570
RIGHT WE TYPICALLY TEND TO

01:05:41.637 --> 01:05:45.508
ENSURE OUTDOOR ALL. METRICS THAT

01:05:45.574 --> 01:05:46.442
MAKES SENSE BECAUSE WE ACCESS

01:05:46.509 --> 01:05:49.178
THOSE WE DON'T MEASURE ON.

01:05:49.245 --> 01:05:51.180
INDOOR CONDITIONS SUCH AS

01:05:51.247 --> 01:05:52.682
HUMIDITY AND AIRSPEED AND SO

01:05:52.748 --> 01:05:54.350
FORTH BUT WE DO KNOW THAT MANY

01:05:54.417 --> 01:05:56.152
FACTORS CAN IMPROVE YOUR COMFORT

SUCH AS HAVING FAMILY. WHICH CAN

01:05:58.187 --> 01:05:59.889
IN TURN INCREASE AIRSPEED

01:05:59.955 --> 01:06:01.791
REDUCING THE HUMIDITY WITHIN THE

01:06:01.857 --> 01:06:03.059
HOME WHICH IS OPPOSITE OF WHAT

01:06:03.125 --> 01:06:04.560
IT'S LONGER WITH US. BUT AIR

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:06.729
CONDITIONING ALSO. IT'S KIND OF

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:09.865
ON YOU KNOW IT IMPROVING THE

01:06:09.932 --> 01:06:11.400
HUMIDITY IN YOUR HOME- SOMEONE

ARE WORK IN OUR MODELING WORK WE

01:06:12.268 --> 01:06:13.969
DEFINITELY TRY TO. TAKE A LOT OF

01:06:14.036 --> 01:06:15.338
THESE FACTORS INTO ACCOUNT AND

01:06:15.404 --> 01:06:17.206
E TRY TO. LOOK AT THE

01:06:17.273 --> 01:06:19.408
EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR- POTENTIAL

01:06:19.475 --> 01:06:22.578
MEASURES. BY A SERIES OF. BUT

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:24.113
THE TECHNICAL COMFORT REALLY

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:25.448
COMFORT AND HEALTH METRICS

01:06:25.514 --> 01:06:26.615
INCLUDING WELL I WON'T GO

01:06:26.682 --> 01:06:27.883
THROUGH ALL THE NAMES BUT

01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:30.086
THERE'S NOT THERE'S TO BE. SO

01:06:30.152 --> 01:06:32.688
FOR. ME JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE NO

01:06:32.755 --> 01:06:34.223
AND SO IT WENT HEARING FROM YOU

01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:43.299
YOU. YOU'RE YOU'RE GETTING A

01:06:43.366 --> 01:06:44.400
PRECISE ABOUT THE F. OF VERY

01:06:44.467 --> 01:06:47.169
MITIGATE MEASURE. BUT THE- STILL

01:06:47.236 --> 01:06:48.270
THAT SIR OF PRIORITIZATION. IN

01:06:48.337 --> 01:06:49.672
GETTING SOLID ENOUGH. DATA TO

01:06:49.739 --> 01:06:51.874
KNOW- IF LEAST YOU KNOW ROUGHLY

01:06:51.941 --> 01:06:53.242
WHERE THE ISSUE IS RIGHT I MEAN

01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:55.711
YOU YOU'VE IDENTIFIED- THE

01:06:55.778 --> 01:06:56.846
THIRTY AMBIENT TEMPERATURE

01:06:56.912 --> 01:06:59.315
ISSUES MAPPED OVER SAY INCOME OR

01:06:59.382 --> 01:07:01.283
DIFFERENT VULNERABILITY INDEX.

01:07:01.350 --> 01:07:03.753
AND THEN AT THAT POINT. YOU HAVE

01:07:03.819 --> 01:07:04.954
SOME BEST PRACTICES TO DEPLOY

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:07.423
IN- AND THAT'S MAYBE WHERE

01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:08.758
GOVERNMENT STARTS TO COME IN AND

01:07:08.824 --> 01:07:10.326
START TO BUILD A LITTLE MORE.

01:07:10.393 --> 01:07:11.927
GRANULARITY BUT MY ONLY OTHER

01:07:11.994 --> 01:07:14.363
QUESTION THEN WAS FOR MISTER PAR

01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:17.099
FREE IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW WHEN

01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:19.402
YOU CAN'T IDENTIFY EVERY SINGLE

01:07:19.468 --> 01:07:20.970
HOUSE AND WHAT THEIR INDIVIDUAL

01:07:21.036 --> 01:07:23.272
NEEDS ARE I KNOW. YOU'VE BEEN

01:07:23.339 --> 01:07:25.474
ADVOCATING AND TEEING UP SORT OF

01:07:25.541 --> 01:07:28.144
THOSE NO REGRETS MUCH LARGER

01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:30.079
COMMUNITY WIDE SOLUTIONS THAT.

01:07:30.146 --> 01:07:31.614
EVERYONE CAN BENEFIT FROM AND

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:34.116
THERE'S BEEN SOME CONTROVERSY OR

01:07:34.183 --> 01:07:36.819
I GUEST- LIGHT SKEPTICISM MAYBE

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:38.888
IS THE WAY TO OPPOSE IT NOW

01:07:38.954 --> 01:07:41.457
ABOUT. THINGS LIKE COOL ROOFS IN

01:07:41.524 --> 01:07:43.426
COOL PAVEMENT. AND SOME SOME

01:07:43.492 --> 01:07:45.060
SORT OFSUBTLE INDICATION MAYBE

01:07:45.127 --> 01:07:46.562
IT'S FROM THE ASPHALT INDUSTRY

01:07:46.629 --> 01:07:48.164
ABOUT SOME COLLATERAL EFFECTS

01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:50.299
FROM GOING THIS WAY BUT I DID

01:07:50.366 --> 01:07:51.667
WANT TO GIVE YOU. AN OPPORTUNITY

01:07:51.734 --> 01:07:53.302
TO LAY TO REST ANY OF THAT

01:07:53.369 --> 01:07:56.705
SKEPTICISM AND- JUST A LITTLE

01:07:56.772 --> 01:07:59.842
GIVE A LITTLE MORE- WITH A

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:01.610
LITTLE MORE POINTEDNESS FOR THE

01:08:01.677 --> 01:08:04.580
COMMITTEE TO UNDERSTAND- THOSE

01:08:04.647 --> 01:08:06.482
ARE TO AMBIENT. ISSUES THAT YOU

01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:07.683
CAN ACTUALLY TURN THE

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:09.385
TEMPERATURE DOWN IN A COMMUNITY

01:08:09.452 --> 01:08:11.353
WITH- THAT YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:12.988
TO TURN YOUR AC TEMPERATURE

01:08:13.055 --> 01:08:14.857
DOWN. IT'S TURNED DOWN FOR YOU

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:16.659
BECAUSE THERE'S A TREE ON YOUR

01:08:16.725 --> 01:08:18.294
STREET. AND IT'S NOT A GIANT.

01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:20.362
ASPHALT PARKING LOT RIGHT IN

01:08:20.429 --> 01:08:22.398
FRONT YOUR HOUSE BUT- BUT FOR

01:08:22.465 --> 01:08:25.301
ALL THE COOLING SKEPTICS OUT

01:08:25.367 --> 01:08:30.639
THERE JUST. WANTED. TO GIVE YOU

01:08:30.706 --> 01:08:32.007
A QUICK CHANCE TO RESPOND- THANK

01:08:32.074 --> 01:08:34.510
YOU SO- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:08:34.577 --> 01:08:36.312
PEOPLE DON'T RECOGNIZE IS THAT

01:08:36.378 --> 01:08:37.947
THESE COOLING MATERIALS CAN BE

01:08:38.013 --> 01:08:41.183
MANUFACTURED. IN SUCH A WAY

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:45.721
WHERE YOU NEARLY HI CAMP DOWN.

01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:47.823
ANY OF THE A GREENHOUSE GAS

01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:49.291
EMISSIONS THAT GOES INTO

01:08:49.358 --> 01:08:52.027
PRODUCING SO THAT'S THAT IS A

01:08:52.094 --> 01:08:54.797
REALLY IMPORTANT FACTS SO FOR

01:08:54.864 --> 01:08:56.565
EXAMPLE THE THREE M. COMPANY

01:08:56.632 --> 01:09:00.870
THAT RUNS ONLINE IN- CHINO-

01:09:00.936 --> 01:09:04.240
CALIFORNIA- THAT THEY PROCESS

01:09:04.306 --> 01:09:06.342
THEIR GRANULES THERE WITH A

01:09:06.408 --> 01:09:09.211
SOLAR POWER. AS A WAY OF HAVING

01:09:09.278 --> 01:09:11.280
A MORE- SORT OF HOLISTIC

01:09:11.347 --> 01:09:14.817
APPROACH TO REDUCING- THE

01:09:14.884 --> 01:09:16.418
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM

01:09:16.485 --> 01:09:18.854
THEIR PRODUCTS AND IN TALKING

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:20.523
WITH A NUMBER OF THE OTHER

01:09:20.589 --> 01:09:23.425
VENDORS WHO PRODUCED THE COOL

01:09:23.492 --> 01:09:26.095
PAVEMENT. REELS WHETHER IT'S THE

01:09:26.161 --> 01:09:30.199
GAF COMPANY- OR OTHERS- THAT ARE

01:09:30.266 --> 01:09:31.634
OUT THERE THE RECENT GREAT

01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:34.770
CALIFORNIA COMPANIES. AND THEY

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:36.672
HAVE ASSURED ME THAT THEY CAN

01:09:36.739 --> 01:09:38.207
PRODUCE ALL OF THEIR PRODUCTS A

01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:41.911
USING RENEWABLE TECHNOLOGIES. TO

01:09:41.977 --> 01:09:44.413
POWER THE PROCESSING AND

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:47.850
MANUFACTURING OF THOSE PRODUCTS-

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:49.151
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT FOLKS

01:09:49.218 --> 01:09:49.885
DON'T REALIZE IS THAT WHEN

01:09:49.952 --> 01:09:51.487
YOU'RE WALKING ON THE SIDEWALK

01:09:51.554 --> 01:09:53.956
YOU'RE ON CONCRETE AND CONCRETE

01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:58.093
HAS THE SAME SOLAR REFLECTIVITY

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:00.195
. IS THE COOLEST THIS BURKE THE

01:10:00.262 --> 01:10:03.032
SAME AND IT'S AROUND TWENTY

01:10:03.098 --> 01:10:04.300
THREE THREE WHICH IS VERY

01:10:04.366 --> 01:10:05.234
PROPITIOUS BECAUSE THAT'S THE

01:10:05.301 --> 01:10:07.536
SAME AS A PRE INDUSTRIAL

01:10:07.603 --> 01:10:11.340
SOCIETY- SOLAR REFLECTANCE IN

01:10:11.407 --> 01:10:15.177
THE- THE MOON IF YOU DON'T LIKE

01:10:15.244 --> 01:10:16.745
THE SUN'S REFLECTION WHEN YOU'RE

01:10:16.812 --> 01:10:18.747
ON A SIDEWALK. WILL YOU WON'T

01:10:18.814 --> 01:10:19.882
LIKE IT WHEN YOU'RE ON THE

01:10:19.949 --> 01:10:21.283
STREET BUT I THINK MOST OF US

01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:23.319
ARE QUITE ACCLIMATED TO THAT

01:10:23.385 --> 01:10:27.423
DEGREE OF THE ALBEDO OF. SOLAR

01:10:27.489 --> 01:10:29.391
REFLECTIVE YES. BY WALKING ON A

01:10:29.458 --> 01:10:31.293
SIDEWALK SO THERE HAVE BEEN

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:34.096
SOME- COMPLAINTS ABOUT THAT-

01:10:34.163 --> 01:10:36.165
THAT PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT

01:10:36.231 --> 01:10:38.334
THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS OF

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.903
THESE ARE PRODUCTS THAT SOME

01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:42.638
PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE

01:10:42.705 --> 01:10:45.307
HUSTLER REFLECTIVE OF PROPERTIES

01:10:45.374 --> 01:10:47.710
AND HOW IT MIGHT POTENTIALLY IN

01:10:47.776 --> 01:10:49.445
THE MOMENT MADE PEOPLE. A LITTLE

01:10:49.511 --> 01:10:52.314
BIT HARDER- BUT WE SIMPLY

01:10:52.381 --> 01:10:54.016
HAVEN'T FOUND THOSE TO BE

01:10:54.083 --> 01:11:01.423
INSURMOUNTABLE- OBSTACLES. TO A

01:11:01.490 --> 01:11:04.393
WIDESPREAD. EXPERIMENT WITH THE

01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:06.562
- WITH THESE COOLING. THERE IS

01:11:06.629 --> 01:11:07.896
ONE MORE COOLING PRODUCT THAT'S

01:11:07.963 --> 01:11:09.131
OUT THERE THAT IS NOT

01:11:09.198 --> 01:11:11.934
APPROPRIATE FOR A LOS ANGELES

01:11:12.001 --> 01:11:15.104
AREA WHERE MOST OF THE COOLING

01:11:15.170 --> 01:11:16.605
PRODUCTS USE A FOREIGN THOUGHT

01:11:16.672 --> 01:11:20.142
TITANIUM. OF BASS- TITANIUM

01:11:20.209 --> 01:11:22.244
OXIDE BASE TITANIUM IS

01:11:22.311 --> 01:11:24.113
ESSENTIALLY BURKE LITTLE WHITE

01:11:24.179 --> 01:11:25.581
PIECES OF SAND THAT YOU MIGHT

01:11:25.648 --> 01:11:26.915
FIND ON THE BEACH IN YOUR

01:11:26.982 --> 01:11:28.917
AGGREGATING THEM ALL TOGETHER

01:11:28.984 --> 01:11:33.555
INTO ONE PLACE- AND THAT IS-

01:11:33.622 --> 01:11:36.191
USING OF BARITE. FORMED EIGHT.

01:11:36.258 --> 01:11:41.664
UNFORTUNATELY. TO DEATH. REFLECT

01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:45.734
IN THE U. B. AND IT ACTS CAN. TO

01:11:45.801 --> 01:11:48.370
A FORMING SMART AND SO OUR OUR

01:11:48.437 --> 01:11:50.773
GOAL IS TO HAVE THE RIGHT KIND

01:11:50.839 --> 01:11:53.108
OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE RIGHT PLACE

01:11:53.175 --> 01:11:54.576
AND WE DON'T WANT TO FOR MORE

01:11:54.643 --> 01:11:57.079
SMOG AND IN LOS ANGELES AND SO

01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:59.481
THE ERROR I BASED MATERIALS THAT

01:11:59.548 --> 01:12:00.783
ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN

01:12:00.849 --> 01:12:02.718
REFLECTING SUNLIGHT. MAY NOT BE

01:12:02.785 --> 01:12:04.753
APPROPRIATE FOR THE SOUTH COAST

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:07.222
ON A QUEUE IN THE DISTRICT. SO

01:12:07.289 --> 01:12:10.426
FORGET MY LONG ANSWER BUT- THERE

01:12:10.492 --> 01:12:11.860
ARE THE RIGHT PRODUCTS FOR THE

01:12:11.927 --> 01:12:13.429
RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME

01:12:13.495 --> 01:12:15.931
AND I SHOULD ADD THAT ASSEMBLY

01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:22.438
COMBO- AND- WITH THE- AND

01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:25.407
CRESCENTS. NO THEY DO NOT NEED-

01:12:25.474 --> 01:12:27.943
THE COOLING REMEDIES THAT WE'RE

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:29.478
SUGGESTING JUST THE VAST

01:12:29.545 --> 01:12:31.046
MAJORITY OF THE STATE WHERE THE

01:12:31.113 --> 01:12:33.115
PUBLIC RESIDES THOSE ARE THE

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:35.617
PLACES THAT NEED THESE KINDS OF

01:12:35.684 --> 01:12:38.954
CORNERS- THANKS FOR THE INSIGHT

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:41.290
AND- FOR LAYING OUT THAT

01:12:41.356 --> 01:12:42.491
SPECTRUM THAT NOT ALL COOLING

01:12:42.558 --> 01:12:43.926
TECHNOLOGIES ARE BUILT EQUAL

01:12:43.992 --> 01:12:45.594
NECESSARILY BUT ALSO THAT.

01:12:45.661 --> 01:12:47.396
THEY'RE THERE AND THEY'RE ON THE

01:12:47.463 --> 01:12:49.431
SHELF AND WE JUST HAVE TO GO GET

01:12:49.498 --> 01:12:52.568
THEM SO- LET'S TALK A LITTLE

01:12:52.634 --> 01:12:54.570
MORE ON THIS UPCOMING PANEL WAS

01:12:54.636 --> 01:12:56.271
THERE ANY QUESTIONS CENTER LIMÓN

01:12:56.338 --> 01:12:58.874
YOU WANT TO WIN QUICKLY PLEASE

01:12:58.941 --> 01:13:01.110
WELCOME. THANK YOU AND ONE QUICK

01:13:01.176 --> 01:13:02.111
QUESTION SORRY AS I WAS

01:13:02.177 --> 01:13:03.712
LISTENING TO THE COMMENTS THAT

01:13:03.779 --> 01:13:05.013
WERE BEING MADE WE'VE TALKED A

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:07.015
LOT ABOUT- YOU KNOW THE HE IN

01:13:07.082 --> 01:13:08.317
THE IMPACT FOR THE INDIVIDUALS

01:13:08.383 --> 01:13:10.185
AND HEARD TESTIMONIALS AND JUST

01:13:10.252 --> 01:13:11.920
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE SOUTH COAST

01:13:11.987 --> 01:13:13.489
A. Q. M. D. WAS MENTIONED DO WE

01:13:13.555 --> 01:13:15.491
KNOW ANYTHING- I THINK OF

01:13:15.557 --> 01:13:16.625
COMMUNITIES LIKE WILMINGTON

01:13:16.692 --> 01:13:18.327
CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE THAT NOT

01:13:18.393 --> 01:13:19.862
ONLY SUFFER SOME OF THESE HEAT

01:13:19.928 --> 01:13:22.965
WAVES. BUT ALSO- HAVE BEEN KNOWN

01:13:23.031 --> 01:13:24.299
TO HAVE JUST POLLUTANTS IN THE

01:13:24.366 --> 01:13:26.235
AIR THAT ARE A SIGNIFICANTLY

01:13:26.301 --> 01:13:28.337
HIGHER THAN OTHER COMMUNITIES DO

01:13:28.403 --> 01:13:30.739
WE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE

01:13:30.806 --> 01:13:33.475
IMPACT- ON QUALITY COMBINED WITH

01:13:33.542 --> 01:13:36.545
HEAT- BESIDES IT BEING. EXTRA

01:13:36.612 --> 01:13:38.413
BAD- BUT ANYTHING THAT YOU COULD

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:39.782
PERHAPS SHARE AND THAT'S A

01:13:39.848 --> 01:13:41.717
QUESTION TO ANY OF OUR PANELISTS

01:13:41.784 --> 01:13:43.552
YEAH PERHAPS BECAUSE L. A.

01:13:43.619 --> 01:13:45.587
COUNTY YOU JUST FINISH YOUR

01:13:45.654 --> 01:13:47.022
VULNERABILITY INDEX MAYBE YOU

01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:48.590
COULD TAKE A- EVEN A CLOSER

01:13:48.657 --> 01:13:49.858
SNAPSHOT ON A COMMUNITY LIKE

01:13:49.925 --> 01:13:50.959
WILMINGTON THAT SORT HAS THIS

01:13:51.026 --> 01:13:54.196
COMPOUNDING EFFECTS THE CENTER

01:13:54.263 --> 01:13:56.031
IS TALKING ABOUT. THEY'RE HAPPY

01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:57.599
TO ADDRESS THAT THANK YOU. FOR

01:13:57.666 --> 01:13:59.434
THE QUESTION. I'M SO WE ACTUALLY

01:13:59.501 --> 01:14:02.704
FOUND. AIR QUALITY ACROSS OUR

01:14:02.771 --> 01:14:03.939
REPORT LOOKED AT FIVE FINING

01:14:04.006 --> 01:14:06.008
HAZARDS- EXTREME HEAT WAS JUST

01:14:06.074 --> 01:14:07.142
ONE OF THEM. AIR QUALITY IS

01:14:07.209 --> 01:14:09.111
WORSE THAN BY EVERY ON SIGN

01:14:09.178 --> 01:14:11.847
HAZARD THAT. THE LA REGION FACES

01:14:11.914 --> 01:14:14.049
. ACTUALLY NOT JUST EXTREME.

01:14:14.116 --> 01:14:18.120
HEAT- SO HE MAKES OUR OUR OZONE

01:14:18.187 --> 01:14:21.390
- ISSUES WORSE- THAT THAT IS A

01:14:21.456 --> 01:14:23.125
NINE FOUR. BACKSPACE AND IT

01:14:23.192 --> 01:14:24.359
OBVIOUS SEE PEOPLE THINK ABOUT

01:14:24.426 --> 01:14:27.629
WILDFIRE BUT YES CERTAINLY. LIKE

01:14:27.696 --> 01:14:28.764
AND ALSO THE NATURE OF. THE

REQUIREMENTS FOR RENTAL HOUSING

01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:20.495
CURRENTLY. FAILED TO ACCOUNT FOR

01:28:20.561 --> 01:28:21.596
EXTREME HEAT. OUR ORGAN. WORK

01:28:21.663 --> 01:28:22.363
ALONGSIDE RESIDENTS BETTER

01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:23.965
ACUTELY AND DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY

01:28:24.032 --> 01:28:25.733
GROWING CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:28.002
TRAGIC AND UNACCEPTABLE RISE OF

01:28:28.069 --> 01:28:29.003
HEAT RELATED DEATHS IN THE LAST

01:28:29.070 --> 01:28:30.805
DECADE. RECENT MEDIA STORIES IT

01:28:30.872 --> 01:28:32.106
HIGHLIGHTED THE INCREASE IN

01:28:32.173 --> 01:28:33.174
THESE ISSUES AND THE STATE'S

01:28:33.241 --> 01:28:34.642
BASS UNDER COUNTING OF DEATHS

01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:36.644
ATTRIBUTABLE TO EXTREME HEAT.

01:28:36.711 --> 01:28:38.479
BUT THE TRUTH TOLD A CRISIS IS

01:28:38.546 --> 01:28:40.448
LIKELY SIX TIMES HIGHER THAN

01:28:40.515 --> 01:28:41.649
REPORTED AND THIS NUMBER DOES

01:28:41.716 --> 01:28:43.251
NOT INCLUDE IMPACTS TO FAMILIES

01:28:43.317 --> 01:28:45.586
RELATED ILLNESS WHICH DID NOT

01:28:45.653 --> 01:28:47.355
OPEN. TO SOMEONE'S DEATH. THE

01:28:47.422 --> 01:28:49.157
STORY IS ALSO CLEAR THAT LOW

01:28:49.223 --> 01:28:50.792
INCOME CALIFORNIANS PARTICULARLY

01:28:50.858 --> 01:28:51.926
IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE

01:28:51.993 --> 01:28:53.394
INCREASINGLY VULNERABLE TO THE

01:28:53.461 --> 01:28:54.862
IMPACTS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER

01:28:54.929 --> 01:28:56.531
THEY LIVE IN RURAL OR URBAN

01:28:56.597 --> 01:28:58.433
AREAS AND IN A RANGE OF HOUSING

01:28:58.499 --> 01:29:00.334
HI. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:29:00.401 --> 01:29:01.836
CHILDREN THE ELDERLY PEOPLE WITH

01:29:01.903 --> 01:29:03.071
PRE EXISTING HEALTH CONDITIONS

01:29:03.137 --> 01:29:04.305
FARMWORKERS THOSE WITH

01:29:04.372 --> 01:29:06.307
DISABILITIES AND JUST LARGELY

01:29:06.374 --> 01:29:07.575
THE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF

01:29:07.642 --> 01:29:09.744
COLOR THAT ARE AT RISK. AND LIKE

01:29:09.811 --> 01:29:11.279
MANY ISSUES THIS FALLS ON CLEAR

01:29:11.345 --> 01:29:13.481
INCOME LINES FOR PEOPLE WITHOUT

01:29:13.548 --> 01:29:15.116
ACCESS WITH THE HOME AIR

01:29:15.183 --> 01:29:16.718
CONDITIONING OR SHADE HE CAN BE

01:29:16.784 --> 01:29:18.720
DANGEROUS AND ULTIMATELY DEADLY.

01:29:18.786 --> 01:29:19.687
AND IN ADDITION TO HEAT

01:29:19.754 --> 01:29:21.456
EXHAUSTION AND HEATSTROKE

01:29:21.522 --> 01:29:22.390
EXTREME HE CAN WORSEN

01:29:22.457 --> 01:29:23.825
CARDIOVASCULAR AND RESPIRATORY

01:29:23.891 --> 01:29:25.326
PROBLEMS INCREASING THE RISK OF

01:29:25.393 --> 01:29:27.261
STROKES HEART ATTACKS IN ASTHMA

01:29:27.328 --> 01:29:28.696
ATTACKS NOT TO MENTION THE

01:29:28.763 --> 01:29:29.530
EFFECTS IT CAN HAVE ON

01:29:29.597 --> 01:29:31.499
MEDICATION AND MEDICAL EQUIPMENT

01:29:31.566 --> 01:29:33.367
STORAGE. THE MOST ALARMING AND I

01:29:33.434 --> 01:29:34.902
THINK THAT LINE HERE IS THAT

01:29:34.969 --> 01:29:36.537
THESE TYPES THAT'S OUR 100%

01:29:36.604 --> 01:29:37.972
PREVENTABLE. CALIFORNIA

01:29:38.039 --> 01:29:39.440
CURRENTLY IMPOSES UNIFORM

01:29:39.507 --> 01:29:40.975
OBLIGATIONS AND ALL LANDLORDS TO

01:29:41.042 --> 01:29:42.343
MAINTAIN HABITABLE HOUSING SUCH

01:29:42.410 --> 01:29:43.978
AS FUNCTIONING WATER ELECTRICAL

01:29:44.045 --> 01:29:45.947
AND HEATING SYSTEM BUT DOES NOT

01:29:46.013 --> 01:29:47.648
REQUIRE ANY STANDARD TO BE MET

01:29:47.715 --> 01:29:48.583
AND CONNECTION WITH EXTREME

01:29:48.649 --> 01:29:50.752
HEAT. THE RESULT IS THAT MUCH OF

01:29:50.818 --> 01:29:52.854
OUR HOUSING STOCK IS MISSING

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:54.088
BASIC INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE NOT

01:29:54.155 --> 01:29:56.357
BEEN MADE- BACK TO REALLY BLOCK

01:29:56.424 --> 01:29:57.892
MUCH OF THE IMPACTS OF EXTREME

01:29:57.959 --> 01:30:00.161
HEAT SUCH AS PROPERLY INSULATING

01:30:00.228 --> 01:30:07.935
HOMES PROVIDING SHADE. HE FOUND. A VOICE HIGH AND ARE KIND.

01:30:08.002 --> 01:30:09.103
DESPITE HERE- OVER YEAR I TEMP.

01:30:09.170 --> 01:30:10.271
AND MORE FOR AND SEVERE HE- THE

01:30:10.338 --> 01:30:11.973
DOES NOT CURRENTLY WORK. LINE TO

01:30:12.039 --> 01:30:12.940
INSURE THAT TEIR UNITS CAN

01:30:13.007 --> 01:30:14.208
MAINTAIN A MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE

01:30:14.275 --> 01:30:16.110
AND THAT SUPPORTS BASIC. BASIC

01:30:16.177 --> 01:30:17.979
HEALTH AND WELL BEING. OUR

01:30:18.045 --> 01:30:19.080
CLIENTS ARE LEFT DEFENSELESS

01:30:19.147 --> 01:30:20.748
FROM EXCRUCIATING HEAT BASED ON

01:30:20.815 --> 01:30:21.516
THE UNEQUAL COOLING

01:30:21.582 --> 01:30:22.884
INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE STATE THAT

01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:24.185
FAVORS INDIVIDUALS WITH MONEY

01:30:24.252 --> 01:30:25.620
PRIVILEGE BETTER HOUSING

01:30:25.686 --> 01:30:28.356
OPPORTUNITY AND GREEN SPACE. AND

01:30:28.422 --> 01:30:29.624
CLEARLY EVERY PERSON IN THE

01:30:29.690 --> 01:30:31.125
STATE DESERVES TO LIVE IN A HOME

01:30:31.192 --> 01:30:31.893
THAT PROTECTS THEM FROM

01:30:31.959 --> 01:30:34.328
TEMPERATURE EXTREMES WHETHER

01:30:34.395 --> 01:30:35.596
IT'S COLD OR HOT. THE CLEAREST

01:30:35.663 --> 01:30:36.497
AND MOST COMMON SENSE SOLUTION

01:30:36.564 --> 01:30:37.598
TO PREVENT THE NEEDLESS HE

01:30:37.665 --> 01:30:39.033
RELATED THAT. THAT WE'RE SEEING

01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:40.168
IS ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIANS

01:30:40.234 --> 01:30:42.703
HAVE AN ACCESS TO A SAFE AND HOW

01:30:42.770 --> 01:30:44.906
HOME WHERE THEY CAN FIND REFUGE

01:30:44.972 --> 01:30:46.741
FROM EXTREME HEAT AND ITS

01:30:46.808 --> 01:30:47.375
CONSEQUENT EFFECTS. WE HAVE AN

01:30:47.441 --> 01:30:48.342
OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THIS

01:30:48.409 --> 01:30:49.277
ISSUE WITH CHANGES TO

01:30:49.343 --> 01:30:50.611

01:42:38.352 --> 01:42:38.886
RESIDENTS FAMILY MEMBER THE

01:42:38.952 --> 01:42:41.788
CHALLENGER. DO YOU TURN ON THE

01:42:41.855 --> 01:42:42.389
AIR CONDITIONING THAT DOESN'T

01:42:42.456 --> 01:42:44.157
HAVE INFILTRATION- LIKE HE

01:42:44.224 --> 01:42:48.195
COMPLAINED- OR DO YOU OR DO YOU

01:42:48.262 --> 01:42:50.497

01:42:50.564 --> 01:42:52.199
HERE THE MORNING AT THE ASHES

01:42:52.266 --> 01:42:53.433
ARE COMING IN. THE ASHES ARE

01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:56.803
COMING IN- OR DO YOU DEAL WITH A

01:42:56.870 --> 01:42:57.838
105 DEGREES HEAT AND NOT TURN IT

01:42:57.905 --> 01:42:59.506
ON I THINK UNFORTUNATELY THE

01:42:59.573 --> 01:43:00.941
SITUATION THAT MANY CALIFORNIANS

01:43:01.008 --> 01:43:02.809
ARE DEALING WITH. AND EVEN IN

01:43:02.876 --> 01:43:04.144
SOME AREAS WHERE YOU DON'T

01:43:04.211 --> 01:43:06.980
MEANWHILE SPOKE TO BE SUFFERING.

01:43:07.047 --> 01:43:08.215
REALLY BAD OUT THERE FOLLOWING

01:43:08.282 --> 01:43:16.223
SIMPLY THINK THAT THINKING ABOUT. THIS LIST SICKENING GIVES THAT

01:43:16.290 --> 01:43:16.857
OPPORTUNITY. WELL THAT'S THAT'S

01:43:16.924 --> 01:43:18.191
ONE CONCLUDES I WOULD SAY I

01:43:18.258 --> 01:43:19.126
WOULD FROM THIS. INTO WE'LL BE

01:43:19.192 --> 01:43:20.494
TALKING TO. SUBS PAN AND GIVING

01:43:20.561 --> 01:43:21.428
THEM SOME OF OUR FEEDBACK BASED

01:43:21.495 --> 01:43:23.530
ON THIS TESTIMONY BUT- YOU KNOW

01:43:23.597 --> 01:43:26.333
WE WE'VEHEARD TESTIMONY ABOUT-

01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:28.201
THE EXTREME HEAT. FUNDING

01:43:28.268 --> 01:43:30.337
EFFORTS AND STRATEGIES GOING ON

01:43:30.404 --> 01:43:31.672
THERE'S- THERE'S BUILDING

01:43:31.738 --> 01:43:32.839
DECARBONIZATION EFFORTS THE

01:43:32.906 --> 01:43:34.608
ADMINISTRATION'S UNDERTAKING.

01:43:34.675 --> 01:43:35.742
THERE'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:43:35.809 --> 01:43:36.944
INVESTMENTS THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:43:37.010 --> 01:43:38.211
UNDERTAKING THERE'S ENERGY

01:43:38.278 --> 01:43:39.346
EFFICIENCY INVESTMENTS WERE

01:43:39.413 --> 01:43:42.115
UNDERTAKING. AND LOOKING FOR

01:43:42.182 --> 01:43:44.818
THOSE ALIGNMENTS WHERE DOES THE

01:43:44.885 --> 01:43:45.819
SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES

01:43:45.886 --> 01:43:47.454
INVESTMENTS. AND ARE INFILL

01:43:47.521 --> 01:43:49.189
HOUSING INVESTMENTS WHERE CAN

01:43:49.256 --> 01:43:51.291
THEY LEVERAGE ALSO COOLING

01:43:51.358 --> 01:43:53.627
OPPORTUNITIES- WHERE CAN WE FIND

01:43:53.694 --> 01:43:56.029
THE INTERFACE BETWEEN SAY. A

01:43:56.096 --> 01:43:57.064
TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE

01:43:57.130 --> 01:43:58.432
COMMUNITIES IN INVESTING IN

01:43:58.498 --> 01:44:01.168
URBAN GREENING- IN COOL ROOFS IN

01:44:01.234 --> 01:44:04.071
OPEN SPACE ALONG SIDE AN UP LIFT

01:44:04.137 --> 01:44:06.106
EFFORT WITHIN THE HOME AROUND-

01:44:06.173 --> 01:44:07.274
BUILDING DECARBONIZATION IT

01:44:07.341 --> 01:44:10.010
ALSO. IMPROVES COOLING LOOKING

01:44:10.077 --> 01:44:11.511
FOR THOSE SYNERGIES I THINK WILL

01:44:11.578 --> 01:44:13.847
BE CRITICAL TO MAKING- OUR

01:44:13.914 --> 01:44:15.415
INVESTMENT STRATEGY COST

01:44:15.482 --> 01:44:17.551
EFFECTIVE FIRST OF ALL BUT ALSO.

01:44:17.618 --> 01:44:19.519
TO NOT EXPECT GOVERNMENT TO HAVE

01:44:19.586 --> 01:44:20.787
THAT MANY INTERVENTION POINTS IT

01:44:20.854 --> 01:44:22.356
IS VERY DIFFICULT TO REACH

01:44:22.422 --> 01:44:24.057
PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE NOT.

01:44:24.124 --> 01:44:24.992
FAMILIAR WITH THE SYSTEM AND

01:44:25.058 --> 01:44:27.461
THAT'S WHERE. ORGANIZATIONS LIKE

01:44:27.527 --> 01:44:29.463
MISS KRISTY OZER. MISMA NOT SIR

01:44:29.529 --> 01:44:31.798
MISS REBELS ARE VERY IMPORTANT-

01:44:31.865 --> 01:44:34.034
IN CONNECTING US TO COMMUNITY.

01:44:34.101 --> 01:44:35.235
BUT YOU KNOW SINCE WE HAVE

01:44:35.302 --> 01:44:37.204
MISTER MACALLAN HERE WHO'S AT

01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:40.407
THE HELM- DO WHEN BAD THINGS

01:44:40.474 --> 01:44:42.876
HAPPEN I JUST. I AM NOT SURE

01:44:42.943 --> 01:44:45.345

YOU. IF YOU'RE ARE STILL

01:44:46.947 --> 01:44:48.715
AVAILABLE BUT- I DID WANT TO

01:44:48.782 --> 01:44:51.652
DRILL DOWN AND JUST GET A SENSE

01:44:51.718 --> 01:44:53.520
OF HOW MANY- WHAT THE RESOURCE

01:44:53.587 --> 01:44:55.856
MIX LOOKS LIKE IN A IN A COUNTY

01:44:55.922 --> 01:44:57.858
THE SIZE OF LA- DO YOU HAVE A

01:44:57.924 --> 01:44:59.726
SENSE OF HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE AT

01:44:59.793 --> 01:45:01.094
RISK DURING ANY GIVEN HE'D HAVE

01:45:01.161 --> 01:45:02.996
BEEN. AND HOW MANY CENTERS FOR

01:45:03.063 --> 01:45:04.765
INSTANCE THAT WE HAVE FOR THOSE

01:45:04.831 --> 01:45:06.066
FOLKS I MEAN WHAT WHAT IS THE

01:45:06.133 --> 01:45:14.541
SORT OF- RISK TO MITIGATION TOOL. PROPORTION LOOK LIKE RIGHT NOW

01:45:14.608 --> 01:45:15.208
. YEAH I THINK SAID SENATOR

01:45:15.275 --> 01:45:18.912
STERN SO. A LOT OF OUR DATA IS

01:45:18.979 --> 01:45:20.681
KIND OF ANECDOTAL FROM PREVIOUS

01:45:20.747 --> 01:45:24.017
EXPERIENCES THE TO ANSWER THE

01:45:24.084 --> 01:45:25.552
QUESTION AT THE BEGINNING YOU

01:45:25.619 --> 01:45:28.355
KNOW WE BASED OUR MITIGATION

01:45:28.422 --> 01:45:30.957
MEASURES OR OUR OUR EMERGENCY

01:45:31.024 --> 01:45:32.192
PROTECTIVE MEASURES I SHOULD

01:45:32.259 --> 01:45:35.395
SAY- ON ON THE NATIONAL WEATHER

01:45:35.462 --> 01:45:37.931
SERVICE IS FORECAST FOR SPECIFIC

01:45:37.998 --> 01:45:39.466
AREAS SO L. A. COUNTY SO

01:45:39.533 --> 01:45:41.868
GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE YOU CAN

01:45:41.935 --> 01:45:43.503
HAVE AN EXTREME HEAT EMERGENCY

01:45:43.570 --> 01:45:44.938
OCCURRING IN ONE PART OF THE

01:45:45.005 --> 01:45:47.808
COUNTY AND MODERATE TO NORMAL

01:45:47.874 --> 01:45:48.775
CONDITIONS IN ANOTHER PART OF

01:45:48.842 --> 01:45:50.644
THE COUNTY. SO OUR RESPONSE IS

01:45:50.711 --> 01:45:53.280
VERY MUCH BASED ON THE REAL

01:45:53.346 --> 01:45:54.214
WORLD FORECAST THAT WE'RE

01:45:54.281 --> 01:45:56.183
GETTING AND THEN THE DEPLOYMENT

01:45:56.249 --> 01:45:58.452
OF RESOURCES TO THOSE AFFECTED

01:45:58.518 --> 01:46:01.455
AREAS. WITHIN THAT WE WORK WITH

01:46:01.521 --> 01:46:03.090
OUR PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT.

01:46:03.156 --> 01:46:05.125
ALONG WITH OUR CITIES TO

01:46:05.192 --> 01:46:07.427
IDENTIFY YOU KNOW AREAS THAT ARE

01:46:07.494 --> 01:46:09.029
GOING TO BE MOST VULNERABLE WE

01:46:09.096 --> 01:46:11.364
IMPACTED SO BY THAT I MEAN. YOU

01:46:11.431 --> 01:46:13.567
KNOW CERTAIN COMMUNITIES CAN

01:46:13.633 --> 01:46:15.669
TAKE HIGHER LEVELS OF HEAT THEN

01:46:15.736 --> 01:46:17.704
OTHER COMMUNITY STOPS OF URGENCY

01:46:17.771 --> 01:46:19.873
MANAGEMENT- ISN'T THE

01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:21.475
ORGANIZATION THAT MAKES THAT

01:46:21.541 --> 01:46:22.642
DETERMINATION THAT'S USUALLY

01:46:22.709 --> 01:46:24.911
DONE. IN COLLABORATION BETWEEN

01:46:24.978 --> 01:46:26.146
THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE IS

01:46:26.213 --> 01:46:27.380
FORECASTING OR COUNTIES

01:46:27.447 --> 01:46:29.449
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND

01:46:29.516 --> 01:46:31.618
SPECIFICALLY ARE COUNTY HEALTH

01:46:31.685 --> 01:46:33.987
OFFICER. AND WE I NEED SHE

01:46:34.054 --> 01:46:36.323
COORDINATION MEETINGS AS THIS

01:46:36.389 --> 01:46:38.024
PROCESS GOES ON TO IDENTIFY

01:46:38.091 --> 01:46:39.292
AREAS THAT ARE GOING TO BE MOST

01:46:39.359 --> 01:46:40.694
IMPACTED AND THAT'S WHEN WE

01:46:40.761 --> 01:46:42.629
ACTIVATE THESE DIFFERENT

01:46:42.696 --> 01:46:44.464
EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE MEASURES OF

01:46:44.531 --> 01:46:47.033
WHICH ONE IS COOLING CENTERS.

01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:49.236
I'M DALY THEY ARE NOT THE END

01:46:49.302 --> 01:46:53.607
ALL SALE ALL SOLUTION. THERE ARE

01:46:53.673 --> 01:46:54.241
OTHER STATE. BASED ON BASE ON

01:46:54.307 --> 01:46:55.375
THE- THEY DEPLOY OF OTHER

01:46:55.442 --> 01:46:59.279
RESOURCE- GOING OFF OF ONE OF

01:46:59.346 --> 01:47:01.715
OUR PREVIOUS- AS- TESTIMONIES

01:47:01.782 --> 01:47:05.051
TODAY. YOU KNOW THEY THEY COUNTY

01:47:05.118 --> 01:47:06.520
WORKS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE

01:47:06.586 --> 01:47:08.221
CITIES ON THE SCHOOLING CENTER

01:47:08.288 --> 01:47:10.824
PROGRAM A LOT OF THEM ARE AT.

01:47:10.891 --> 01:47:13.260
FACILITIES THAT HAVE. OTHER

01:47:13.326 --> 01:47:14.594
TYPES OF PROGRAMS ASSOCIATED

01:47:14.661 --> 01:47:16.129
WITH THEM SO THEY ARE GETTING A

01:47:16.196 --> 01:47:18.198
LOT MORE BENEFIT THAN JUST- COOL

01:47:18.265 --> 01:47:20.967
AIR SO A LOT OF THE COUNTY SITES

01:47:21.034 --> 01:47:22.602
ARE OUT OF LIBRARIES. A LOT OF

01:47:22.669 --> 01:47:24.437
CITY SITES OR IN. AREAS OR PARKS

01:47:24.504 --> 01:47:26.673
AND REC FACILITIES THAT INCLUDES

01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:30.110
YOU KNOW ACCESS TO INTERNET-

01:47:30.177 --> 01:47:32.112
POTENTIALLY FOOD. BEING PROVIDED

01:47:32.179 --> 01:47:34.214
THERE AND PROGRAMMING TO SUPPORT

01:47:34.281 --> 01:47:36.116
THEM SO THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER

01:47:36.183 --> 01:47:38.084
SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED AT

01:47:38.151 --> 01:47:41.254
THE SITE. SO THE SECOND PART OF

01:47:41.321 --> 01:47:43.356
THE QUESTION SENATOR IS HOW

01:47:43.423 --> 01:47:45.759
MANY. IT'S REALLY A BROAD

01:47:45.826 --> 01:47:48.595
STROKE- WE USUALLY HAVE MORE

01:47:48.662 --> 01:47:51.598
THAN A FEW DOZEN ACTIVATED- IF

01:47:51.665 --> 01:47:53.433
IT'S A WIDESPREAD EVENT. AND

01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:55.802
PROPORTIONALLY WE SEE USUALLY A

01:47:55.869 --> 01:47:57.437
VERY SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE

01:47:57.504 --> 01:48:00.340
ACTUALLY USING THAT RESOURCE.

01:48:00.407 --> 01:48:02.776
AND I THINK THE HIGHEST USE OF

01:48:02.843 --> 01:48:04.010
THOSE RESOURCES WAS ACTUALLY

01:48:04.077 --> 01:48:06.980
DURING KOBE WHEN WE HAD ONE OF

01:48:07.047 --> 01:48:09.382
OUR- KEY EVENTS DURING THAT-

01:48:09.449 --> 01:48:11.184
MOST RESTRICTIVE PERIOD OF TIME

01:48:11.251 --> 01:48:12.085
DURING THE STATE'S DROUGHT HOME

01:48:12.152 --> 01:48:13.854
ORDERS. AND THERE WERE REALLY NO

01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:15.889
OTHER OPPORTUNITIES WHAT WE'VE

01:48:15.956 --> 01:48:18.625
SEEN IN THE COUNTY IS A LOT OF

01:48:18.692 --> 01:48:22.095
PEOPLE USE. THEIR NORMAL KIND

01:48:22.162 --> 01:48:26.333
OF. GO TO PLACES FOR RELIEVING

01:48:26.399 --> 01:48:27.567
THEMSELVES OF SOME OF THAT HE

01:48:27.634 --> 01:48:28.969
IMPACTS ARE GOING TO SHOPPING

01:48:29.035 --> 01:48:30.337
CENTRES AND MALLS AND THINGS

01:48:30.403 --> 01:48:32.205
LIKE THAT OUTDOOR RECREATION AT

01:48:32.272 --> 01:48:35.242
THE OCEAN- AND SO WHEN ALL OF

01:48:35.308 --> 01:48:36.776
THAT STUFF IS UP AND FUNCTIONING

01:48:36.843 --> 01:48:38.545
WE USUALLY SEE YOU KNOW PRETTY

01:48:38.612 --> 01:48:41.181
PRETTY MODERATE LEVELS OF-

01:48:41.248 --> 01:48:43.783
ATTENDANCE AT AT THE- AT THE

01:48:43.850 --> 01:48:46.019

COMMUNITY CENTER OR EVEN. I MEAN

01:48:54.995 --> 01:48:57.364
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS THIS

01:48:57.430 --> 01:48:59.165
PROPOSAL AROUND RESILIENCE HAVE

01:48:59.232 --> 01:49:00.667
WHICH IS SORT OF A- PUBLIC

01:49:00.734 --> 01:49:03.904
PRIVATE COMMUNITY BASED MY- BUT

THIS ACTUALLY CAME UP IN ONE OF

01:49:49.616 --> 01:49:52.218
THE MORE RECENT HEAT WAVES- WHEN

01:49:52.285 --> 01:49:53.787
THERE WAS COORDINATION BETWEEN

TO NECW BACKWARDS. DID NOT WE

01:50:05.865 --> 01:50:07.667
WERE ABLE TO. AT A MAKE SURE

01:50:07.734 --> 01:50:09.936
THAT- YOU CONTINUES ON SO THAT'S

01:50:10.003 --> 01:50:11.771
BEEN A STANDING PRACTICE WITHIN

01:50:11.838 --> 01:50:13.406
THE COUNTY FOR YEARS IT'S A PART

01:50:13.473 --> 01:50:17.143
OF THAT EXTREME TEMPERATURE PLAN

01:50:17.210 --> 01:50:20.747
AND WE UTILIZE THOSE DIFFERENT-

01:50:20.814 --> 01:50:22.983
FORTY DEVELOP DATABASES THAT

01:50:23.049 --> 01:50:25.552
HAVE A TIENE WITH. OUR COUNTY

01:50:25.618 --> 01:50:29.022
DEPARTMENT TO INITIATE OUT

01:50:29.089 --> 01:50:31.791
THROUGH CASE WORKERS IN THAT WE

01:50:31.858 --> 01:50:32.659
COORDINATE WITH. IN CALIFORNIA

01:50:32.726 --> 01:50:34.227
AT A SCENE ON THEIR VULNERABLE

01:50:34.294 --> 01:50:35.895
POPULATION DATABASES TO MAKE

01:50:35.962 --> 01:50:37.664
SURE THAT THE COMMUNICATIONS

01:50:37.731 --> 01:50:39.466
THAT THEY'RE PUSHING OUT.

01:50:39.532 --> 01:50:40.767
BECAUSE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT

01:50:40.834 --> 01:50:42.769
OVERLAP WHEN THESE EVENTS OCCUR

01:50:42.836 --> 01:50:44.137
THAT THERE'S MOST LIKELY ALSO

01:50:44.204 --> 01:50:45.472
PUBLIC SAFETY POWER START UPS

01:50:45.538 --> 01:50:48.174
OCCURRING- AND HEIGHTENED FIRE

01:50:48.241 --> 01:50:50.610
WEATHER SO WE REALLY HAVE

01:50:50.677 --> 01:50:52.545
ELEVATED OVER THE LAST FEW

01:50:52.612 --> 01:50:56.383
YEARS- AND PUT AN EMPHASIS ON.

01:50:56.449 --> 01:50:57.784
IMPLEMENTING THESE BROADER

01:50:57.851 --> 01:50:58.885
COORDINATION ROLES WITH

01:50:58.952 --> 01:51:00.787
DIFFERENT DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS

01:51:00.854 --> 01:51:02.355
HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY. BUT ON

01:51:02.422 --> 01:51:04.190
EVERY IN ANY GIVEN EVENT TO ME

01:51:04.257 --> 01:51:05.492
HOW HOW MANY PEOPLE DOES THAT

01:51:05.558 --> 01:51:06.826
MEAN YOU ACTUALLY MIGHT HAVE TO

01:51:06.893 --> 01:51:09.195
GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU KNOW ON A

01:51:09.262 --> 01:51:11.531
ON A ON A BIG DO SO LIKE WE TALK

01:51:11.598 --> 01:51:13.166
ABOUT THE 121 DEGREES DAY RIGHT

01:51:13.233 --> 01:51:14.868
IF ALL SYSTEMS ARE FUNCTIONING

01:51:14.934 --> 01:51:17.437
THE RIGHT WAY AND IT'S- IT'S ONE

01:51:17.504 --> 01:51:18.004
TWENTY ONE IN CANOGA PARK. I

01:51:18.071 --> 01:51:19.072
DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW IT'S

01:51:19.139 --> 01:51:20.573
PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT INTO A

01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:22.342
COMA AND IN THE SAN GABRIEL

01:51:22.409 --> 01:51:26.112
VALLEY SO NEEDS LIKE YOU SAID A

01:51:26.179 --> 01:51:28.048
HUGE REACH. COULD THERE BE A DAY

01:51:28.114 --> 01:51:29.015
WHERE YOU'RE HAVING IT. YOU'RE

01:51:29.082 --> 01:51:30.283
LITERALLY HAVING TO REACH OUT TO

LIKE A MILLION PEOPLE AT THEIR

01:51:32.786 --> 01:51:33.787
HOMES ON ANY GIVEN DAY AND SORT

01:51:33.853 --> 01:51:36.189
OF. DOING SOME KIND OF WELLNESS

01:51:36.256 --> 01:51:37.157
CHECK I MEAN I JUST THINK ABOUT

01:51:37.223 --> 01:51:39.993
HOW. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ON SOME

01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:41.928
KIND OF SOCIAL SERVICES. OR

01:51:41.995 --> 01:51:43.563
DISABILITY. YOU KNOW WITHIN A

01:51:43.630 --> 01:51:45.865
COUNTY OF. ELEVEN MILLION YOU'VE

01:51:45.932 --> 01:51:47.534
GOT. ON ANY GIVEN DAY HUNDREDS

01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:49.769
OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. SO I

01:51:49.836 --> 01:51:51.004
MEAN IF YOU FOUND THROUGH THESE

01:51:51.071 --> 01:51:53.306
PAST HEAT WAVES THAT THEIR

01:51:53.373 --> 01:51:54.574
BOTTLENECKS WITH THAT INTERFACE

01:51:54.641 --> 01:51:55.875
AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO SORT OF

01:51:55.942 --> 01:51:57.577
IMPROVE. SO IT'S NOT JUST THE

01:51:57.644 --> 01:51:59.813
TWEET- THE ALERT. BUT IT'S LIKE

01:51:59.879 --> 01:52:01.681
IT'S GOT THAT THAT LEVEL OF

01:52:01.748 --> 01:52:04.150
SECURITY THAT WE SEE SAY FROM.

01:52:04.217 --> 01:52:06.019
US YOU KNOW LIKE YOU SAY WITH

01:52:06.086 --> 01:52:07.187
THE SS THE SOCIAL WORKER

01:52:07.253 --> 01:52:08.755
THEMSELVES IS. MAKING SURE THAT

01:52:08.822 --> 01:52:10.457
THERE'S SOME INTERFACE AND THAT.

01:52:10.523 --> 01:52:13.460
THEY CAN AND GET- YOU KNOW. SOME

01:52:13.526 --> 01:52:14.894
KIND OF TECHNOLOGY FROM THE

01:52:14.961 --> 01:52:16.229
UTILITY OR TO BRING THINGS TO

01:52:16.296 --> 01:52:17.630
THE HOMES LIKE HOW. HAVE YOU

01:52:17.697 --> 01:52:20.834
SEEN THAT MITIGATION. AND

01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:23.269
RESPONSE IN ACTION. YEAH SO I

01:52:23.336 --> 01:52:24.804
MEAN I CAN FOLLOW UP WITH DAY

01:52:24.871 --> 01:52:26.806
WITH THE COMMITTEE WITH SOME.

01:52:26.873 --> 01:52:29.075
DETAILED RESPONSES TODAY TO THE

01:52:29.142 --> 01:52:30.777

THE OFF THE CUFF RIGHT NOW- AS

01:52:33.213 --> 01:52:34.948
IT RELATES TO THE SECOND PART I

01:52:35.014 --> 01:52:36.816
THINK THERE'S DEFINITELY STILL

01:52:36.883 --> 01:52:39.586
ADDITIONAL WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:52:39.652 --> 01:52:41.221
DONE. AS IT RELATES TO ENSURING

01:52:41.287 --> 01:52:42.188
THAT WERE EFFECTIVELY

COMMUNICATING OUT TO. ALL THOSE

01:52:44.557 --> 01:52:47.494
VARIOUS- VARIOUS GROUPS. WHAT

01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:49.629
WE'VE WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AND

01:52:49.696 --> 01:52:51.331
I THINK IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF

01:52:51.397 --> 01:52:53.099
THE CONTINUE CONVERSATION. IS

01:52:53.166 --> 01:52:55.635
ENSURING THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR

01:52:55.702 --> 01:52:58.104
THE RIGHT. THE RIGHT POPULATION

01:52:58.171 --> 01:53:00.140
GROUP. MEANING THE MOST

01:53:00.206 --> 01:53:01.674
VULNERABLE POPULATION AND NOT

01:53:01.741 --> 01:53:03.576
JUST PULLING FROM DATABASES AND

01:53:03.643 --> 01:53:04.711
SAYING LIKE EVERYONE WITHIN THIS

01:53:04.777 --> 01:53:06.212
DATABASE NEEDS TO BE.

01:53:06.279 --> 01:53:08.882
COMMUNICATED TO BASED ON BASED

01:53:08.948 --> 01:53:11.184
ON. AN EVENT OCCURRING WHERE

01:53:11.251 --> 01:53:13.486
THEY GEOGRAPHICALLY ARE LOCATED-

01:53:13.553 --> 01:53:15.288
WE HAVE TO BE VERY BECAUSE OF

01:53:15.355 --> 01:53:19.559
THE SIZE OF L. A. COUNTY WE HAVE

01:53:19.626 --> 01:53:22.562
TO BE VERY. I THOUGHT. D. AND

01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:25.165
HOW. WATCHING THE IS DATA POINTS

01:53:25.231 --> 01:53:26.833
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE- EVEN IF

01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:29.836
IN I GETTING THE RIM TO THE TO

01:53:29.903 --> 01:53:32.305
THE MOST- IMPACTED COMMUNITIES

OUT THERE WHO WERE DEALING WITH-

01:53:58.831 --> 01:54:00.900
SUB STANDARD LIVING CONDITIONS.

01:54:00.967 --> 01:54:03.336
IS CAN YOU CAN YOU JUST

01:54:03.403 --> 01:54:04.137
ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE IN

01:54:04.204 --> 01:54:08.274
YOUR POINTS SO. IF I'M A TENANT-

01:54:08.341 --> 01:54:11.511
AND- I LIVE IN A UNIT THAT HAS

01:54:11.578 --> 01:54:13.213
AN AIR CONDITIONING UNIT BUT THE

01:54:13.279 --> 01:54:14.414
FILTER ON ITS BUSTED AND THEY

01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:16.683
CAN'T GET DOWN TO SEVENTY TWO

01:54:16.749 --> 01:54:18.585
AND- YOU SORT OF JUST KNOW THAT

01:54:18.651 --> 01:54:20.653
AND- MAYBE YOU'VE GOT A BOX FAN

01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:23.056
BUT- YOU BASICALLY LIVE. IN

01:54:23.122 --> 01:54:25.425
80 DEGREES HEAT FOR WEEKS ON

01:54:25.491 --> 01:54:27.427
END- INSIDE THE HOUSE WHICH I

01:54:27.493 --> 01:54:30.496
KNOW IS THE CASE FOR- MANY MANY.

01:54:30.563 --> 01:54:32.365
PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE

01:54:32.432 --> 01:54:33.566
ESPECIALLY IN OVERCROWDED

01:54:33.633 --> 01:54:35.635
HOUSING- WEIRD THERE'S EVEN LESS

01:54:35.702 --> 01:54:38.371
SPACE BUT THERE'S NO RECOURSE

01:54:38.438 --> 01:54:39.806
UNDER LANDLORD TENANT LAW

01:54:39.872 --> 01:54:41.641
CURRENTLY UNDER THEIR WARRANTY

01:54:41.708 --> 01:54:43.643
OF HABITABILITY OR ANY KIND OF

01:54:43.710 --> 01:54:45.144
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION TO

01:54:45.211 --> 01:54:49.115
PROVIDE. THAT KIND OF- OF.

01:54:49.182 --> 01:54:52.585
HABITABLE LIVING CONDITION WHEN

01:54:52.652 --> 01:54:53.620
IT COMES TO THE ACTUAL

01:54:53.686 --> 01:54:54.554
TEMPERATURE. THAT'S EXACTLY

01:54:54.621 --> 01:54:55.521
RIGHT AND I THINK YOU KNOW

01:54:55.588 --> 01:54:56.856
WESTERN CENTER AND HER

01:54:56.923 --> 01:54:58.157
COLLEAGUES ARE ADVOCATING FOR A

01:54:58.224 --> 01:55:00.994
COST A POLICY SOLUTION BUT ALSO.

01:55:01.060 --> 01:55:03.263
SETTING WHICH IS WE NEED TO HAVE

01:55:03.329 --> 01:55:04.631
RENTAL HOUSING BE ABLE TO

01:55:04.697 --> 01:55:06.032
MAINTAIN AND AN INDOOR AIR

01:55:06.099 --> 01:55:08.201
TEMPERATURE AND FOR HEATING IT.

01:55:08.268 --> 01:55:10.103
HAS BEEN LONG RECOGNIZED AS A

01:55:10.169 --> 01:55:11.804
HABITABILITY STANDARDS SO FOR

01:55:11.871 --> 01:55:14.073
EXAMPLE THE CURRENT HABITABILITY

01:55:14.140 --> 01:55:17.510
CODES AND THE HOME IS. A

01:55:17.577 --> 01:55:18.444
STANDARD IF THEY DO NOT HAVE.

01:55:18.511 --> 01:55:20.546
MEANS FOR CHEATING AND THE

01:55:20.613 --> 01:55:21.281
BUILDING CODE STANDARDS

01:55:21.347 --> 01:55:22.615
COMMISSION HAS ADOPTED THOSE

01:55:22.682 --> 01:55:23.916
REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THAT

01:55:23.983 --> 01:55:26.219
AND SAYING THAT. HOMES MUST BE

01:55:26.286 --> 01:55:27.453
ABLE TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM ROOM

01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:29.422
AT. TEMPERATURE OF SEVENTY

01:55:29.489 --> 01:55:32.058
DEGREES- AT LEAST THREE FEET OFF

01:55:32.125 --> 01:55:33.793
THE GROUND BUT THERE IS NO

01:55:33.860 --> 01:55:36.429
HIGHER AND MAX LIMITS. TO THAT

01:55:36.496 --> 01:55:38.398
AND SO WHAT WE FIND IS THAT NO

01:55:38.464 --> 01:55:39.332
TENANTS DON'T REALLY HAVE THE

01:55:39.399 --> 01:55:40.833
RECOURSE IF THEIR HOME IS

01:55:40.900 --> 01:55:43.636
INCREDIBLE CREDIBILITY- HI. JUST

01:55:43.703 --> 01:55:46.839
SAY. WHY CAN'T MY IN MY RENTAL

01:55:46.906 --> 01:55:49.142
UNIT BE COOL- THERE'S NO COOLING

01:55:49.208 --> 01:55:50.376
MECHANISM IN A RENTAL HOME AND

01:55:50.443 --> 01:55:51.911
SO I THINK ONE THING THAT WE'VE

01:55:51.978 --> 01:55:53.713
BEEN SEEING ACROSS. THE UNITED

01:55:53.780 --> 01:55:55.415
STATES AND NOT NECESSARILY FOCUS

01:55:55.481 --> 01:55:57.750
ON RESILIENCY BUT THERE'S BEEN A

01:55:57.817 --> 01:55:59.285
MUCH MORE FOCUSED ON THE FACT

01:55:59.352 --> 01:56:01.287
THAT. YOU KNOW WE NEED TO BE

01:56:01.354 --> 01:56:02.221
PROTECTING OUR HOMES AND

01:56:02.288 --> 01:56:03.956
HABITABILITY IS HUGE SO THAT IS

01:56:04.023 --> 01:56:05.358
OUT OF NEW YORK RELATED TO THAT

01:56:05.425 --> 01:56:06.693
RECENT FIRE THAT HAPPENED IN

01:56:06.759 --> 01:56:08.194
JUST THE TRAGEDIES THAT WE'VE

01:56:08.261 --> 01:56:10.196
SEEN. AS SHOWING THAT LOW INCOME

01:56:10.263 --> 01:56:11.431
CALIFORNIANS AND LOW INCOME

01:56:11.497 --> 01:56:13.132
FOLKS IN GENERAL HAVE TO

01:56:13.199 --> 01:56:17.103
WITHSTAND- A LOT MORE ISSUES IN

01:56:17.170 --> 01:56:19.305
THEIR OWN HOMES. AND WE BELIEVE.

01:56:19.372 --> 01:56:21.107
A SIMPLE SOLUTION WOULD JUST

01:56:21.174 --> 01:56:23.543
NEED TO HAVE AN UPWARDS CAP OF

01:56:23.609 --> 01:56:25.411
WHAT. CAN BE AN AMBIENT

01:56:25.478 --> 01:56:27.013
TEMPERATURE WITHIN YOUR HOME

01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:28.681
THAT AND THEREFORE IF WE HAVE

01:56:28.748 --> 01:56:30.817
THAT UPWARDS CAP. ATTENDANT CAN

01:56:30.883 --> 01:56:32.652
THEN YOU KNOW REACH OUT TO A

01:56:32.719 --> 01:56:34.187
CODE INSPECTOR AND SAY MY HOME

01:56:34.253 --> 01:56:36.622
HAS BEEN. OVER THIS YOU KNOW A

01:56:36.689 --> 01:56:37.790
HUNDRED DEGREES THIS MANY DAYS

01:56:37.857 --> 01:56:39.225
IN A ROW AND IT'S INCREDIBLY

01:56:39.292 --> 01:56:42.395
DANGEROUS- SO OVERALL IT IS A

01:56:42.462 --> 01:56:45.131
POLICY SOLUTION AND THE VALUE.

01:56:45.198 --> 01:56:46.699
THAT WE MUST MAINTAIN AN AMBIENT

01:56:46.766 --> 01:56:49.736
TEMPERATURE AND INFOSYSTEMS-

01:56:49.802 --> 01:56:51.471
THANK YOU FOR THAT M. WE'LL BE

01:56:51.537 --> 01:56:52.972
FOLLOWING UP ON THAT ISSUE WITH

01:56:53.039 --> 01:56:56.175
YOU- BIT BEFORE WE WRAP THIS ONE

01:56:56.242 --> 01:56:58.878
I DIDN'T WANT TO COME BACK- TO

01:56:58.945 --> 01:57:02.048
MISTER OF ALL- WHEN YOU'RE IN

01:57:02.115 --> 01:57:04.851
YOUR RESILIENCE HUB CONCEPT IN

01:57:04.917 --> 01:57:08.488
THE PROPOSAL. HOW MUCH OF THIS

01:57:08.554 --> 01:57:09.288
DO YOU DO YOU SORT OF ENVISION

01:57:09.355 --> 01:57:11.724
IS A NEW BUILT INFRASTRUCTURE

FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. IN

02:20:02.460 --> 02:20:05.096
HAVING MY GRANDPARENTS EVACUATE

02:20:05.163 --> 02:20:06.731
DURING THE WILL THE FIRE AND-

02:20:06.798 --> 02:20:08.666

SAY THAT WILDFIRE EMERGENCY BUT

02:20:38.029 --> 02:20:39.964
