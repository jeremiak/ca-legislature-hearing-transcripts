INCREASING FREQUENCY ARE RELYING

00:20:23.422 --> 00:20:24.389 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ON AUTOMATED TECHNOLOGY TO

00:20:24.456 --> 00:20:26.258 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
ASSIST IN ISSUING VIOLATIONS OF

00:20:26.325 --> 00:20:27.759 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OUR TRAFFIC SAFETY LAWS. AND A

00:20:27.826 --> 00:20:29.061 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS RECENTLY

00:20:29.127 --> 00:20:30.796 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAS BEEN. THE AUTOMATIC ISSUANCE

00:20:30.862 --> 00:20:32.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
OF CITATIONS FOR TOLLING

00:20:32.431 --> 00:20:34.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
VIOLATIONS WHICH HAS HAD A LOT

00:20:34.166 --> 00:20:35.601 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
OF SUCCESS IN RECENT YEARS.

00:20:35.667 --> 00:20:36.735 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
A NEW TECHNOLOGIES EMERGING

00:20:36.802 --> 00:20:37.936 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
THAT WILL ALLOW LOCAL

00:20:38.003 --> 00:20:39.438 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
JURISDICTIONS TO ENFORCE.

00:20:39.504 --> 00:20:41.273 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HIGH OCCUPANCY VEHICLE LANES

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.141 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
OCCUPANCY RULES WITH.

00:20:43.208 --> 00:20:44.343 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
SOME AUTOMATION AND IT'S REALLY

00:20:44.409 --> 00:20:45.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
REMARKABLE TECHNOLOGY USES A

00:20:45.944 --> 00:20:47.512 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
COMBINATION OF ARTIFICIAL

00:20:47.579 --> 00:20:48.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%

LEARNING. TO BE ABLE TO IN AN

00:20:50.182 --> 00:20:51.950 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AUTOMATED WAY DETERMINE HOW MANY

00:20:52.017 --> 00:20:53.552 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OCCUPANTS THEY ARE IN A CAR. AND

00:20:53.619 --> 00:20:55.520 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
ISSUE A VIOLATION AUTOMATICALLY

00:20:55.587 --> 00:20:57.656 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
IF THE NUMBER OF OCCUPANTS DOES

00:20:57.723 --> 00:20:59.191 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NOT MEET THE THRESHOLD FOR THE

00:20:59.257 --> 00:21:00.459 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HIGH OCCUPANCY LIAM IN WHICH

00:21:00.525 --> 00:21:01.960 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
VEHICLES TRAVELING SO. RECENT

00:21:02.027 --> 00:21:03.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STUDIES HAVE INDICATED THAT THIS

00:21:03.462 --> 00:21:05.664 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
TECHNOLOGY HAS ABOUT A NINETY

00:21:05.731 --> 00:21:07.265 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
FIVE PERCENT ACCURACY RATE. AND

00:21:07.332 --> 00:21:09.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ABOUT A ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT

00:21:09.334 --> 00:21:12.371 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
PAUSES TO A FALSE POSITIVE RATE

00:21:12.437 --> 00:21:13.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YOU THINK ABOUT THAT IT'S IS

00:21:13.672 --> 00:21:16.041 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THAT IS REMARKABLE ACCURACY I

00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:17.542 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
DON'T THINK THAT A HUMAN. COULD

00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:22.014 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
DO EQUALLY WELL IF THEY SPENT A

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.749 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME ON EACH

00:21:23.815 --> 00:21:26.518 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PHOTOGRAPH IS THESE ARE MACHINES

00:21:26.585 --> 00:21:27.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
DO HOWEVER THAT IS SMALL

00:21:27.753 --> 00:21:30.288 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CONSOLATION IF YOU'RE ONE OF THE

00:21:30.355 --> 00:21:32.324 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ONE AND TWENTY. PEOPLE THAT WERE

00:21:32.391 --> 00:21:35.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ISSUED ONE OF THE CITATIONS THAT

00:21:35.527 --> 00:21:37.029 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
REALLY DON'T DESERVE TO BE

00:21:37.095 --> 00:21:37.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
ISSUED A CITATION.

00:21:37.829 --> 00:21:38.897 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
SO CURRENT STATE LAW REQUIRES

00:21:38.964 --> 00:21:40.465 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
CERTAIN INFORMATION BE GIVEN TO

00:21:40.532 --> 00:21:41.967 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
A CONSUMER ALONG WITH THE

00:21:42.034 --> 00:21:42.768 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
VIOLATION THAT WAS GENERATED IN

00:21:42.834 --> 00:21:44.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AN AUTOMATED FASHION. AND THIS

00:21:44.569 --> 00:21:44.870 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:13%
BILL.

00:21:44.936 --> 00:21:46.171 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE WILL.

00:21:46.238 --> 00:21:49.975 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ANTI REQUIREMENT THAT IF THE

00:21:50.042 --> 00:21:50.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AUTOMATED TICKET IS ISSUED FOR A

00:21:50.709 --> 00:21:51.543 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HIGH OCCUPANCY VEHICLE VIOLATION

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:52.878 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THAT THAT VIOLATION NOTICE ALSO

00:21:52.944 --> 00:21:53.779 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
INCLUDE THE PHOTOGRAPHIC

00:21:53.845 --> 00:21:54.646 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
EVIDENCE THAT WAS USED TO

00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:56.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DETERMINE THE VIOLATION. AND

00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:56.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THIS IS GOING TO DO TWO THINGS

00:21:56.715 --> 00:21:57.549 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FIRST OF ALL IT'S GOING TO

00:21:57.616 --> 00:22:00.018 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
INCREASE CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE.

00:22:00.085 --> 00:22:01.186 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
OF THE USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY

00:22:01.253 --> 00:22:02.654 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY HARD TO

00:22:02.721 --> 00:22:03.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ARGUE WITH SOMETHING WHEN YOU'RE

00:22:03.955 --> 00:22:04.890 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
GIVEN A PICTURE OF YOUR VEHICLE

00:22:04.956 --> 00:22:05.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU CAN SEE CLEARLY YOU'RE THE

00:22:05.891 --> 00:22:07.392 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
ONLY ONE IN THE VEHICLE AND YOU

00:22:07.459 --> 00:22:08.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WERE IN THE HIGH OCCUPANCY

00:22:08.794 --> 00:22:09.795 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
VEHICLE AND THAT'S PRETTY HARD

00:22:09.861 --> 00:22:10.729 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ARGUMENT. WITH BUT THE OTHER

00:22:10.796 --> 00:22:12.064 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THING IT WILL DO IS IF YOU'RE

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:15.167 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
ONE OF THE. FIVE PERCENT OF

00:22:15.233 --> 00:22:16.535 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
PEOPLE WHO WERE ISSUED A

00:22:16.601 --> 00:22:17.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
VIOLATION IN ERROR IT'S GOING TO

00:22:17.736 --> 00:22:18.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GIVE YOU A TOOL TO CONTEST THE

00:22:18.937 --> 00:22:20.505 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
VIOLATION WHICH I THINK IS ONLY

00:22:20.572 --> 00:22:22.107 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FAIR SO I HOPE THIS IS WORTHY OF

00:22:22.174 --> 00:22:24.109 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
YOUR SUPPORT I RESPECTFULLY

00:22:24.176 --> 00:22:25.711 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
REQUEST. AND I GO OUT ON AB

STE IN THE SPACES IT WAS

00:23:35.747 --> 00:23:36.615 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
APPROPRIATE TO RESTRICT THE USE

00:23:36.681 --> 00:23:38.250 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
OF THOSE SPACES.

00:23:38.316 --> 00:23:39.718 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
PART TWO ONLY ELECTRIC VEHICLES

00:23:39.785 --> 00:23:41.553 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HOWEVER THOUGHT THAT IGNORES A

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.522 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
COUPLE OF ITEMS OF STANDING

00:23:43.588 --> 00:23:45.791 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
PRACTICE IN STATE CODE ONE OF

00:23:45.857 --> 00:23:47.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%

HAVE.

00:29:41.779 --> 00:29:43.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WELL. AS PARKING OR JUST

00:29:43.348 --> 00:29:45.216 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
DROPPING OFF OR IT IS PARKING

00:29:45.283 --> 00:29:47.552 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ALTHOUGH IT IS NARROWLY TAILORED

00:29:47.619 --> 00:29:49.320 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO BE ONLY PARKING THAT INVOLVES

00:29:49.387 --> 00:29:50.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE LOADING AND OFFLOADING. OF

00:29:50.989 --> 00:29:52.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOMEONE WITH A WHEELCHAIR THAT

00:29:52.891 --> 00:29:53.858 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
USES A LEFT WHERE HE RAN.

00:29:53.925 --> 00:29:55.426 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
SO IT IS VERY NARROWLY TAILORED

00:29:55.493 --> 00:29:57.428 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
TO THOSE USES.

00:29:57.495 --> 00:29:59.297 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
SO THE THE THE VEHICLE WOULDN'T

00:29:59.364 --> 00:30:00.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STAY THERE ONCE THE THE PERSON

HONOR OFF.

00:30:03.201 --> 00:30:04.636 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WELL I I THINK IT WOULD DEPEND

00:30:04.702 --> 00:30:06.137 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
ON TO THAT THERE'S NOTHING IN

00:30:06.204 --> 00:30:08.706 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THE THE EXEMPTION THAT REQUIRES

00:30:08.773 --> 00:30:09.874 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
IT TO ONLY BE LOADING AND

00:30:09.941 --> 00:30:11.109 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
OFFLOADING SO IF THE ONLY

00:30:11.176 --> 00:30:12.443 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
OCCUPANT OF THE VEHICLE WAS

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:14.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SOMEONE. IN A WHEELCHAIR THE WHO

00:30:14.579 --> 00:30:16.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DRIVES THAT THE VEHICLE AND THEN

00:30:16.414 --> 00:30:18.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
USES A LIFT TO OFFLOAD CLEAR

00:30:18.183 --> 00:30:19.717 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THEIR WHEELCHAIR OBVIOUSLY.

00:30:19.784 --> 00:30:21.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE VEHICLE WOULD STAY THERE

00:30:21.352 --> 00:30:22.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WELL THEY DID WHATEVER THEY NEED

DO YOU WISH TO COMMENT ON THE.

00:39:12.383 --> 00:39:12.850 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
THAT'S CLEARLY A

00:39:12.917 --> 00:39:14.685 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MISUNDERSTANDING OF THAT WAS THE

00:39:14.752 --> 00:39:15.119 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
IMPRESSION THAT WAS.

00:39:15.186 --> 00:39:16.287 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:03%
.

00:39:16.353 --> 00:39:17.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
RECEIVED IT WAS NOT THE INTENT

00:39:17.988 --> 00:39:18.489 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
BUT THAT'S HOW THE BILL WAS

00:39:18.556 --> 00:39:19.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
WRITTEN.

00:39:19.957 --> 00:39:20.257 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
SO.

00:39:20.324 --> 00:39:21.659 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
I JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU

00:39:21.726 --> 00:39:23.027 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BECAUSE THAT THE CITY LONG BEACH

00:39:23.094 --> 00:39:24.729 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
WILL DOES HAVE SOME.

00:39:24.795 --> 00:39:25.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH THIS

00:39:25.596 --> 00:39:27.231 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:33%
NEW APPROACH.

00:39:27.298 --> 00:39:29.100 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
WE WHERE. WE WOULD TO TEST THIS

00:39:29.166 --> 00:39:30.868 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
IS NOT A NEW APPROACH THAT THIS

00:39:30.935 --> 00:39:32.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WAS THE INTENT ALTHOUGH FROM THE

00:39:33.037 --> 00:39:34.238 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
VERY BEGINNING WHAT THEY'RE

00:39:34.305 --> 00:39:34.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SAYING IS THAT ACTUALLY.

00:39:34.839 --> 00:39:37.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
NOT

00:39:37.074 --> 00:39:37.942 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND WHERE ARE YOU WHERE BONE

00:39:38.008 --> 00:39:39.410 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT'S THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF THAT

00:39:39.477 --> 00:39:42.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WAS NOT THE CASE AGREED THAT'S

00:39:42.646 --> 00:39:43.214 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAT WE'RE BACK HERE TO MAKE YOU

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.048 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:38%
WANT TO CHANGE.

00:39:44.115 --> 00:39:44.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PRIOR TO CLEAN WE JUST WANT TO

00:39:44.949 --> 00:39:45.783 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
CLARIFY ITS NOT CHANGE.

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:51.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE.

00:39:51.155 --> 00:39:53.858 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:23%
BLOOM OF.

00:39:53.924 --> 00:39:57.428 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT WAS YOUR THIRD ENFORCEMENT.

00:39:57.495 --> 00:39:58.028 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
MOST MATHIS HAVE QUESTIONS OF

00:39:58.095 --> 00:39:58.262 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:18%
HEALTH.

00:39:58.329 --> 00:40:00.231 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:18%
I USED.

00:40:00.297 --> 00:40:03.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEN M. MADE INTERESTED IN HIS

00:40:03.267 --> 00:40:05.069 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
OPPOSITION FROM THE CITY.

00:40:05.136 --> 00:40:06.537 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
OKAY BECAUSE I'VE SEEN BEFORE

00:40:06.604 --> 00:40:08.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OUR CITIES WILL HAVE A PROBLEM

00:40:08.506 --> 00:40:09.707 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:13%
WAYS.

00:40:09.774 --> 00:40:11.275 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
COMPANIES THAT THEY CONTRACT

00:40:11.342 --> 00:40:13.577 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
WITH TO DO THE TICKETS.

00:40:13.644 --> 00:40:15.446 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
SO I AND MY MY THOUGHT IT HOW

00:40:15.513 --> 00:40:16.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COME THEY'RE NOT RENEGOTIATING

00:40:16.914 --> 00:40:18.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THE CONTRACTS WITH THESE

00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:20.351 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AGENCIES THAT THEY HIRE.

00:40:20.417 --> 00:40:21.919 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
DO THEM I'M IN THE THE BILL

00:40:21.986 --> 00:40:22.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
CLEARLY IS JUST.

00:40:22.887 --> 00:40:25.089 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SIMPLIFICATION TO GO BACK AND.

00:40:25.156 --> 00:40:26.323 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
I JUST WHAT WAS ALREADY DONE TO

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:28.325 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
CLARIFY.

00:40:28.392 --> 00:40:30.528 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
SO FOR ME IT KIND OF COMMON

00:40:30.594 --> 00:40:32.763 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
SENSE THAT IF YOU GOT A
CONTRACT.

00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:34.398 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IT'S DOINGTHAT THE PARKING

00:40:34.465 --> 00:40:36.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TICKETS OR ANY OF THE TICKETS.

00:40:36.967 --> 00:40:39.537 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ITS THE I MEAN. QUIETLY QUESTION

00:40:39.603 --> 00:40:44.341 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
FOR FOR THE OPPOSITION.

00:40:44.408 --> 00:40:45.643 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUT NOW I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS

00:40:45.709 --> 00:40:46.544 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
BECAUSE I'VE SEEN DIFFERENT

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:47.378 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THINGS AND I'VE SEEN THINGS

00:40:47.444 --> 00:40:48.946 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
HAPPEN WITH WITH SOME OF MY

00:40:49.013 --> 00:40:50.681 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
CITIES WHERE THEY'VE HAD.

00:40:50.748 --> 00:40:53.050 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
ISSUES WITH ONE FIRM IN THAT IT

00:40:53.117 --> 00:40:54.285 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SWITCHING OVER TO ANOTHER FIRM

00:40:54.351 --> 00:40:55.820 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THAN PEOPLE GETTING TICKETS

00:40:55.886 --> 00:40:57.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TWICE AND THREE TIMES A. RIGHT

00:40:57.922 --> 00:40:59.824 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
IT'S IT'S A MASSIVE SELL.

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:01.125 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
MANY CITIES DO CONTRACT BUT

00:41:01.192 --> 00:41:03.027 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
SACRAMENTO DOES IT ITSELF SO WE

00:41:03.093 --> 00:41:04.862 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
DO IT INTERNALLY SO THERE'S NOT

00:41:04.929 --> 00:41:05.329 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
A QUESTION OF CONTRACT

00:41:05.396 --> 00:41:06.497 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:28%

BUT THE TWENTY TWENTY BILLION

01:12:28.043 --> 01:12:29.411 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DOLLAR YEAH WE WOULD UTILIZE

01:12:29.478 --> 01:12:31.280 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
THOSE GUYS THAT SUGGESTED

01:12:31.346 --> 01:12:33.682 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EARLIER FOR. A COUPLE OF THINGS.

01:12:33.749 --> 01:12:35.117 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
BUT ONE WE PROPOSE IN THIS PLAN

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:36.819 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%

THE NUMBERS THAT ARE BEFORE YOU

01:14:14.917 --> 01:14:16.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WOULD WHICH WE CALL THE BASELINE

ESTIMATE.

01:14:17.519 --> 01:14:19.221 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IS THE RESULT OF THAT EXERCISE

01:14:19.288 --> 01:14:20.022 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT'S WHERE YOU GET THE TEN

WHICH IS

01:14:30.499 --> 01:14:32.568 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
I'VE DONE ON AN ESTIMATE OF

.

01:14:48.917 --> 01:14:51.153 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
SO THAT'S THE BASELINE.

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:52.654 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAT WE ARE DOING DIFFERENTLY IN

01:14:52.721 --> 01:14:53.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THIS PLANS BEFORE IS NOT DONE IN

FOR PROJECT OF THIS MAGNITUDE

01:15:02.531 --> 01:15:03.398 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
AND WE DON'T HAVE.

01:15:03.465 --> 01:15:05.634 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK DONE

01:15:08.103 --> 01:15:09.905 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
SIMPLE DOLLAR ESTIMATE.

01:15:09.972 --> 01:15:11.740 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
SO WHAT I'VE INCLUDED HERE IS A

01:15:11.807 --> 01:15:13.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
UTILIZING AYE AYE WHAT I WOULD

CALL BEST INDUSTRY PRACTICE

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:16.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO PROVIDE A RANGE OF AROUND

01:15:17.012 --> 01:15:18.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
THAT BASELINE.

01:15:18.814 --> 01:15:20.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
IF WE MANAGE WELL.

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:21.717 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GOING FORWARD WE CAN COME IN

01:15:21.783 --> 01:15:23.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BELOW THAT SEVENTY SEVEN WE HAVE

01:15:23.151 --> 01:15:24.753 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
A LOW RANGE.

01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:26.088 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THREE WHICH IS CLOSE TO THE

01:15:26.154 --> 01:15:28.056 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ESTIMATE FROM THE TWENTY SIXTEEN

01:15:28.123 --> 01:15:29.791 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUSINESS PLAN. AND A HIGH OF

01:15:29.858 --> 01:15:31.560 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
NINETY EIGHT WHICH IS.

01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:33.762 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
GENERALLY THE SWING UNDER

01:15:33.829 --> 01:15:35.430 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
INDUSTRY PRACTICE AT THIS LEVEL

01:15:35.497 --> 01:15:37.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF PROJECT DEVELOPMENT IS TWENTY

01:15:37.532 --> 01:15:39.134 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PERCENT BELOW THIRTY PERCENT

01:15:39.201 --> 01:15:41.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ABOVE. WHERE WE KNOW MORE LIKE

01:15:41.169 --> 01:15:42.971 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT SWING

01:15:43.038 --> 01:15:44.973 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
IS LOWER BECAUSE FIVE PERCENT

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:47.009 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BELOW FIFTY PERCENT ABOVE? SO WE

01:15:47.075 --> 01:15:49.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
USED THE BASELINE TO LAY OUT OUR

SIXTEEN BUSINESS PLAN.

01:17:10.392 --> 01:17:12.027 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THE SCENARIO THAT WAS PRESENTED

01:17:12.094 --> 01:17:13.562 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT PLANNED ASSUME TO FINANCING

01:17:13.628 --> 01:17:15.130 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
OF CAP AND TRADE AS WELL.

01:17:15.197 --> 01:17:17.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHAT WE DID IN THIS PLAN WAS A

01:17:17.866 --> 01:17:19.301 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ARTICULATED WITH A LITTLE MORE

01:17:19.368 --> 01:17:20.836 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
SPECIFICITY WHAT WOULD BE? WHAT

01:17:20.902 --> 01:17:22.371 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THE INDUSTRY IS RECOMMENDED THE

01:17:22.437 --> 01:17:23.472 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
KIND OF THINGS YOU NEED TO MAKE

01:17:23.538 --> 01:17:24.506 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
THE CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS

01:17:24.573 --> 01:17:26.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
UNANSWERABLE? USED TO BE A

01:17:26.341 --> 01:17:28.310 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
STABLE SOURCE OF FUNNY TO BE.

01:17:28.377 --> 01:17:30.045 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
INVESTMENT GRADE SO WE'RE

01:17:30.112 --> 01:17:30.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
LOOKING FOR A FLOOR OF A

IDEAL.

01:17:39.321 --> 01:17:40.622 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ALSO TO GET INVESTMENT GRADE

01:17:40.689 --> 01:17:41.923 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
RATING SO THOSE ARE SORT OF

01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:43.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THREE THINGS THE INDUSTRY IS

01:17:43.759 --> 01:17:44.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
RECOMMENDED THAT YOU NEED.

01:17:44.593 --> 01:17:46.595 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
TO GET THE HIGHEST INVESTMENT

01:17:46.661 --> 01:17:48.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GRADE RATING FOR THE FINANCING

01:17:48.096 --> 01:17:49.664 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT THE IDEA FINANCING CAP AND

01:17:49.731 --> 01:17:50.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
TRADE.

01:17:50.632 --> 01:17:52.034 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IS REALLY HAS TO DO WITH BEING

01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:53.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
ABLE TO.

01:17:53.068 --> 01:17:54.803 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
BRING DOLLARS FORWARD TO MEET

01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:56.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OUR CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION COSTS

01:17:56.338 --> 01:17:57.305 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
AT THE TIME THE KAPPA

01:17:57.372 --> 01:17:58.640 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CONSTRUCTION USED TO BE BUILT.

01:17:58.707 --> 01:18:00.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT DOING A MAKE A PROJECT OF

01:18:00.475 --> 01:18:02.344 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THIS MAGNITUDE ON A PAGE YOU GO

01:18:02.411 --> 01:18:04.179 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BASIS WOULD HAVE US CONSTRUCTING

01:18:04.246 --> 01:18:05.280 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THIS THING ALL THE WAY OUT OF

01:18:05.347 --> 01:18:07.082 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
TWENTY FIFTY YEAR BEYOND.

01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:07.516 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:18%
AND SO.

01:18:07.582 --> 01:18:09.451 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THE FINANCING ELEMENT IS SIMPLY

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:10.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO BRING DOLLARS FORD SEEING GET

01:18:10.852 --> 01:18:12.788 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
THE WORK DONE SOONER.

01:18:12.854 --> 01:18:14.956 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
I GUESS MY MY CONCERN IS THAT I

01:18:15.023 --> 01:18:15.791 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DON'T I DON'T KNOW OF ONE WORD

01:18:15.857 --> 01:18:16.892 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
AND WHEN DID IN THE DEBATE OF

01:18:16.958 --> 01:18:18.493 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CAP AND TRADE THAT THERE WAS ANY

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.262 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
JUSTIFICATION USE CAP AND TRADE

01:18:20.328 --> 01:18:21.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO PAY BOND DEBT AND SO IN. IN

01:18:21.930 --> 01:18:23.265 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TERMS OF INVESTING CAPITAL

01:18:23.331 --> 01:18:24.199 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DOLLARS I THINK A LOT OF FOLKS

01:18:24.266 --> 01:18:26.134 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WERE ANTICIPATING THAT YOU WOULD

01:18:26.201 --> 01:18:27.803 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
FUND PROJECTS.

01:18:27.869 --> 01:18:28.370 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
ACTUAL DELIVERABLE PROJECTS

01:18:28.437 --> 01:18:30.839 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
SENSITIVE I USING IT TOOK THE

01:18:30.906 --> 01:18:31.907 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
FUN BONDS.

01:18:31.973 --> 01:18:34.076 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
AND SO THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S

01:18:34.142 --> 01:18:36.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CLEARLY A CONCERN THERE AND THEN

01:18:36.111 --> 01:18:37.679 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
IN TERMS OF THE ASSUMPTIONS YOU

01:18:37.746 --> 01:18:39.047 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MAKE YOU'RE ASSUMING THOUGH THAT

QUESTION CURRENTLY RIGHT YEAH

01:18:44.886 --> 01:18:46.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT'S AN OPEN QUESTION ALTHOUGH

01:18:46.188 --> 01:18:47.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AGAIN I WOULD SO SAFE FROM A

01:18:47.389 --> 01:18:49.124 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%

AROUND THE STATE THAT DEDICATE

01:19:36.304 --> 01:19:37.005 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
SALES TAX MONEY TO

01:19:37.072 --> 01:19:39.407 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS TO BOND

01:19:39.474 --> 01:19:40.575 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
AGAINST THOSE REVENUES.

01:19:40.642 --> 01:19:42.477 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
IT'S AT A VERY COMMON FOR

01:19:42.544 --> 01:19:44.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PROJECTS OF THIS SIZE AND SCOPE.

01:19:44.179 --> 01:19:45.780 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
SO THAT YOU CAN PULL THE CASH

01:19:45.847 --> 01:19:47.349 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
FOR DAY AGAIN BE ABLE TO MEET

01:19:47.415 --> 01:19:49.851 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
CAPITAL NEEDS OF THE PROJECT IN

01:19:49.918 --> 01:19:51.553 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A TIMELY WAY BUT. BUT ESTIMATE

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:52.954 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND THAT YOU WOULD BE USING SOME

01:19:53.021 --> 01:19:54.489 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
OF THE CAPITAL DOLLARS TO PAY

01:19:54.556 --> 01:19:57.192 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DOWN DEBT AND INTEREST ON DEBT

01:19:57.259 --> 01:19:57.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
CORRECT THAT THREAT.

01:19:57.726 --> 01:19:58.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
SO.

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:00.061 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU I THINK THE PUBLIC ANYBODY

01:20:00.128 --> 01:20:01.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO KNOW THAT THAT MONEY IS BEING

01:20:01.763 --> 01:20:02.964 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
DIVERTED FROM ONE PROJECT

01:20:03.031 --> 01:20:04.733 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
PROTECT FOR WHAT ONE PROJECT TO

01:20:04.799 --> 01:20:06.635 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
PAY FOR IT FOR FOR DEBT SERVICE

01:20:06.701 --> 01:20:08.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHAT IT WOULD BE PAID A DEBT

01:20:08.203 --> 01:20:09.571 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
SERVICE TO PAY FOR THE

01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:11.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CONSTRUCTION OF THE PROJECT.

01:20:11.139 --> 01:20:13.175 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THEN BUT I GUESS MY LAST

01:20:13.241 --> 01:20:13.808 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
QUESTION IS IN TERMS OF READING

01:20:13.875 --> 01:20:15.644 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THAT. THE BUSINESS PLAN PROJECT

01:20:15.710 --> 01:20:17.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IS A PLAN I MEAN THERE ARE OUT

01:20:17.179 --> 01:20:18.780 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
STILL A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

01:20:18.847 --> 01:20:19.714 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
UNFUNDED ASSETS.

01:20:19.781 --> 01:20:23.285 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
IT'S PROJECT CORRECT.

01:20:23.351 --> 01:20:24.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I'M NOT SURE WHICH MEAN BY

01:20:24.986 --> 01:20:25.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
UNFUNDED ASSETS I'M SORRY GO

01:20:25.587 --> 01:20:26.821 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THERE. IF ON PAGE FORTY ONE YOU

01:20:26.888 --> 01:20:27.756 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
YOU DO

01:20:27.822 --> 01:20:29.858 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
TERM TO TAKE A PASS AS UNFUNDED

01:20:29.925 --> 01:20:30.425 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ASSET AND THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:20:30.492 --> 01:20:31.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
ASSUMPTIONS.

01:20:31.593 --> 01:20:32.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BEING PUT INTO THAT YOU'RE

01:20:32.861 --> 01:20:34.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ASSUMING A LOT OF REVENUE THAT

01:20:34.329 --> 01:20:36.932 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
POTENTIALLY MAY NOT MATERIALIZE

01:20:36.998 --> 01:20:38.500 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
SO THERE IS A LOT OF STILL.

01:20:38.567 --> 01:20:40.835 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
GAPS IN THIS BUSINESS PLAN.

01:20:40.902 --> 01:20:42.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THERE IS NO QUICKLY BOOK. THIS

01:20:42.737 --> 01:20:44.239 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
PROJECT FROM DAY ONE.

01:20:44.306 --> 01:20:45.040 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAS NEVER HAD ALL THE FUNDING IT

01:20:45.106 --> 01:20:45.774 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:13%
NEEDS

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:47.576 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
TO BE COMPLETED.

01:20:47.642 --> 01:20:49.578 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AS I SAID AT THE OUTSET IN TWO

01:20:49.644 --> 01:20:50.212 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN THE VOTERS

01:20:50.278 --> 01:20:51.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
APPROVE THE BOND THAT PROVIDED

01:20:51.846 --> 01:20:54.649 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ONE FIFTH OF THE MONEY FOR THE

01:20:54.716 --> 01:20:57.085 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THE ENTIRE COMPLETED A PROJECT.

01:20:57.152 --> 01:20:58.987 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
BUT NOW WE HAVE ABOUT ONE THIRD

01:20:59.054 --> 01:20:59.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF WHAT WE NEED FOR THE ENTIRE

01:20:59.921 --> 01:21:01.223 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
COMPLETION A PROJECT.

01:21:01.289 --> 01:21:02.924 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THEREFORE OUR STRATEGY HAS BEEN

01:21:02.991 --> 01:21:04.326 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO INVEST THE DOLLARS THAT WE DO

01:21:04.392 --> 01:21:05.894 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:13%
HAVE.

01:21:05.961 --> 01:21:08.430 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO PROVIDE THE BENEFITS TO THE

01:21:08.496 --> 01:21:09.864 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PUBLIC AS SOON AS WE CAN IN AN

01:21:09.931 --> 01:21:11.433 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
INCREMENTAL WAY.

01:21:11.499 --> 01:21:13.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THAT'S WHAT WE CONTINUE TO

01:21:13.535 --> 01:21:15.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PURSUE IN THIS PLAN UNTIL.

01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:17.739 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE'VE WE IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL

01:21:17.806 --> 01:21:18.306 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
FUNDING FOR ELEMENTS OF THE

01:21:18.373 --> 01:21:19.407 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:18%
PROJECT

01:21:19.474 --> 01:21:20.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
I WOULD NOTE THAT.

01:21:20.408 --> 01:21:22.177 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THAT'S NOT UNCOMMON PRACTICE TO

01:21:22.244 --> 01:21:23.912 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
BUILD TRANSIT SYSTEMS.

01:21:23.979 --> 01:21:25.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AROUND STATE YOU BUILD WHICH

01:21:25.714 --> 01:21:27.616 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU HAVE WITH THE MONEY YOU HAVE

01:21:27.682 --> 01:21:28.250 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
IN ULTIMATELY YOU EXPAND OVER

01:21:28.316 --> 01:21:30.151 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
TIME WOULD MORE MONEY IS MADE

01:21:30.218 --> 01:21:32.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AVAILABLE FOR EXPANSION. BUT I

01:21:32.287 --> 01:21:33.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
APPRECIATE THE CANDOR I JUST

01:21:33.488 --> 01:21:34.723 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THINK THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE NOW

01:21:34.789 --> 01:21:37.192 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
SEEING THIS BILL COMING FORWARD

01:21:37.259 --> 01:21:38.793 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
AND I DON'T THINK THAT THE.

01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:40.495 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
I DON'T THINK THEY REALLY TRULY

01:21:40.562 --> 01:21:41.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
UNDERSTAND THE TRUE GAP THAT

01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:43.865 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
EXISTS BETWEEN THAT THE FUNDS

01:21:43.932 --> 01:21:45.333 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE AS A

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:47.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STATE AND THE LACK OF FUNDS THAT

01:21:47.435 --> 01:21:48.803 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

01:27:29.010 --> 01:27:30.111 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
IN ONE DIRECTION OR THE OTHER

01:27:30.178 --> 01:27:31.879 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
AND PRETTY SOON. YOU YOU WONDER

01:27:31.946 --> 01:27:33.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
WHERE IT'S GONE.

01:27:33.081 --> 01:27:34.515 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT TO ME IS A LITTLE BIT HOW

01:27:34.582 --> 01:27:36.217 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
THE PROJECT FEELS NOT ANY

01:27:36.284 --> 01:27:37.418 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REFLECTION ON THE EXPERTISE OF

01:27:37.485 --> 01:27:38.786 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THOSE HAS BEEN WORKING NOT JUST

01:27:38.853 --> 01:27:39.354 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
HOW DEFAULT IN THE LAST TEN

01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:40.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
YEARS.

01:27:41.055 --> 01:27:43.224 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
SO THAT THAT SCENARIO THAT THEY

01:27:43.291 --> 01:27:44.659 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
HAVE EVEN THE SECOND SCENARIO

01:27:44.726 --> 01:27:46.327 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
WHICH IS TO COMPLETE SOME OF IT

01:27:46.394 --> 01:27:48.162 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT.

01:27:48.229 --> 01:27:50.298 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
YEAH I HAVE CONSTITUENTS IN THE

01:27:50.365 --> 01:27:51.699 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
BAY AREA SAY I KNOW EXACTLY

01:27:51.766 --> 01:27:52.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
WHERE THOSE.

01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:54.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DOLLARS CAN BE SPENT BETTER. AND

01:27:54.869 --> 01:27:56.270 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
AND SO LET'S END IT AND MOVE IT

01:27:56.337 --> 01:27:57.305 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOMEWHERE ELSE CAN YOU TALK TO

01:27:57.372 --> 01:27:58.406 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
US ABOUT THE WHY SHOULDN'T WE

01:27:58.473 --> 01:28:00.308 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:18%
END IT.

01:28:00.375 --> 01:28:01.843 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
INSTEAD OF CONTINUE ON AND

01:28:01.909 --> 01:28:03.478 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
POSSIBLY LIKE THAT CARTOON

01:28:03.544 --> 01:28:04.579 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
PUTTING THE RAIL IN FRONT OF US

01:28:04.646 --> 01:28:06.748 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
AS WE AS WE MOVE ALONG.

01:28:06.814 --> 01:28:08.516 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
WELL I'D SAY A COUPLE THINGS OF

01:28:08.583 --> 01:28:10.318 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ONE OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND

01:28:10.385 --> 01:28:12.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUSINESS PLAN DOES NOT REFLECT

01:28:12.086 --> 01:28:13.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE DEPARTURE IN THE STRATEGY. A

01:28:13.821 --> 01:28:16.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GOING FOR FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN IN

01:28:16.124 --> 01:28:17.425 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
TERMS OF WHAT WE WOULD BILL

01:28:17.492 --> 01:28:18.693 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
BUILT FIRST AND AND THE

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:20.028 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
DIRECTION WE WOULD GO. IS

01:28:20.094 --> 01:28:21.896 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
CONSISTENT AND COULD CONTINUOUS

01:28:21.963 --> 01:28:22.530 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
SO.

01:28:22.597 --> 01:28:24.365 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:18%
SO I I.

01:28:24.432 --> 01:28:26.634 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I AGREE A ONE ONE HOP AROUND AND

01:28:26.701 --> 01:28:27.235 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK WE

01:28:27.301 --> 01:28:28.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
DO.

01:28:28.569 --> 01:28:29.437 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THIS GETS BACK TO WHAT I SAID A

01:28:29.504 --> 01:28:30.571 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MINUTE AGO ABOUT THE PROJECT WHY

01:28:30.638 --> 01:28:31.506 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:43%
SHOULD WE CAN TO.

01:28:31.572 --> 01:28:33.341 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:03%
.

01:28:33.408 --> 01:28:35.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FOR ME THE GREATEST VALUE OF

01:28:35.143 --> 01:28:37.145 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:33%
THIS PROJECT.

01:28:37.211 --> 01:28:38.613 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
AND A VALUE THAT I HAVE NOT

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:40.314 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOUND ANY OTHER TRANSPORTATION

01:28:40.381 --> 01:28:41.983 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
PROJECT IN MY TIME HERE.

01:28:42.050 --> 01:28:43.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IS THE MOBILITY BENEFIT FROM

01:28:43.718 --> 01:28:45.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
HIGH SPEED RAIL.

01:28:45.153 --> 01:28:47.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I THE IDEA THAT WE CAN BUILD

01:28:48.056 --> 01:28:48.856 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
SOMETHING AND REDUCE TRAVEL

01:28:48.923 --> 01:28:50.591 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
TIMES.

01:28:50.658 --> 01:28:52.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
VERSES A CAR FOR EXAMPLE GOING

01:28:52.527 --> 01:28:53.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FROM STAMPS ES GO TO LA FROM

01:28:53.928 --> 01:28:55.163 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
SEVEN OR EIGHT HOURS.

01:28:55.229 --> 01:28:57.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
TO THREE OR LESS IS.

01:28:57.699 --> 01:29:00.568 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE OUTSTANDING HAND AND THE

01:29:00.635 --> 01:29:02.070 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
ABILITY TO MOVE PEOPLE FROM THE

01:29:02.136 --> 01:29:03.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BAY AREA THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

01:29:03.604 --> 01:29:05.273 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
INSTEAD OF A SOMETIMES THREE OR

01:29:05.339 --> 01:29:06.974 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
FOUR HOUR TRIP ON THE HIGHWAYS.

01:29:07.041 --> 01:29:09.444 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
TO DO IT IN JUST OVER AN HOUR

01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:12.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IS A DIFFERENCE MAKER I THINK IT

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:13.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WILL CHANGE THE WAY PEOPLE MOVE.

01:29:13.748 --> 01:29:15.016 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
I THINK THAT'S BEEN THE

01:29:15.083 --> 01:29:16.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EXPERIENCE AROUND THE WORLD.

01:29:16.718 --> 01:29:18.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WERE HIGH SPEED RAIL HAS BEEN.

01:29:18.152 --> 01:29:19.253 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
PUT INTO PLACE

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:21.289 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
AND SO IN TERMS OF THE SHOULD

01:29:21.355 --> 01:29:23.424 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
FOR ME. IT'S THAT KIND OF

01:29:23.491 --> 01:29:25.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MOBILITY DIFFERENCE THAT I CAN'T

01:29:25.593 --> 01:29:26.728 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
NAME ANY OTHER PROJECTS BEING

01:29:26.794 --> 01:29:28.096 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
ABLE TO ACHIEVE.

01:29:28.162 --> 01:29:29.630 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THE SIMPLE REALITY WHICH MY

01:29:29.697 --> 01:29:31.132 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
COLLEAGUES ARE TIRED OF HEARING

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:33.634 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
ME SAY. IS THAT NO MATTER HOW

01:29:33.701 --> 01:29:35.303 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MANY LANES YOU BUILD CARS ON THE

01:29:35.369 --> 01:29:36.738 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
HIGHWAY. CAN'T GO TWO HUNDRED

01:29:36.804 --> 01:29:38.506 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:38%
MILES PER HOUR.

01:29:38.573 --> 01:29:40.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUT HIGH SPEED TRAINS CAN'T.

01:29:40.241 --> 01:29:41.843 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
AND THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IN

01:29:41.909 --> 01:29:43.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
CUTTING TRAVEL TIME.

01:29:43.111 --> 01:29:45.246 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
AND SO. TO ME IT'S A VERY

01:29:45.313 --> 01:29:47.148 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IMPORTANT PROJECT TO REALLY GIVE

01:29:47.215 --> 01:29:48.116 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:33%
CALIFORNIANS.

01:29:48.182 --> 01:29:50.184 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
AN OPTION TO MOVE AROUND THAT

01:29:50.251 --> 01:29:51.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THEY DON'T HAVE TODAY IN

01:29:51.652 --> 01:29:53.187 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SEVERELY CUT TRAVEL TIMES IN

01:29:53.254 --> 01:29:54.288 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WHAT IS OTHERWISE A VERY

01:29:54.355 --> 01:29:56.124 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
CONGESTED.

01:29:56.190 --> 01:29:57.558 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THE SITUATION AROUND OUR STATE.

01:29:57.625 --> 01:29:59.393 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
SO SO THAT'S THE THAT'S THE WHY

01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:01.195 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
FOR ME AND AGAIN I WANT TO BE

01:30:01.262 --> 01:30:02.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CLEAR THAT THE STRATEGY WE LAY

01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:04.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
OUT IN THE PLAN.

01:30:04.732 --> 01:30:06.167 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
IS TO MAKE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE

01:30:06.234 --> 01:30:07.702 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NOT LOST INVESTMENTS AND WOULD

01:30:07.769 --> 01:30:09.303 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
NOT BE STRANDED INVESTMENTS

01:30:09.370 --> 01:30:10.738 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
EXTENDING. THE ELECTRIC

01:30:10.805 --> 01:30:12.340 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ELECTRIFICATION A CALTRAIN THE

01:30:12.406 --> 01:30:14.342 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
BAY AREA TO GILROY. WILL HAVE

01:30:14.408 --> 01:30:15.076 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
SOME INTERIM BENEFITS FOR

01:30:15.143 --> 01:30:16.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CALTRAIN SOME LONG TERM BENEFITS

01:30:16.811 --> 01:30:19.180 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
FOR US. FLOTILLA SAME ABOUT THE

01:30:19.247 --> 01:30:19.881 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:18%
OF THE.

01:30:19.947 --> 01:30:21.315 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE STRUCTURES WERE BUILDING

01:30:21.382 --> 01:30:23.084 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THE CENTRAL VALLEY ARE

01:30:23.151 --> 01:30:23.718 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
REQUIREMENTS TO PUT THOSE IN THE

01:30:23.785 --> 01:30:24.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
USE.

01:30:24.185 --> 01:30:25.419 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
AND WE WOULD CONTINUE.

01:30:25.486 --> 01:30:28.356 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
TO DO SO FINAL POINT IS THAT.

01:30:28.422 --> 01:30:30.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE CAP AND TRADE A DOLLARS ALSO

01:30:30.858 --> 01:30:31.592 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
HAVE TO.

01:30:31.659 --> 01:30:32.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
HAVE TO RESULT IN SOME

01:30:32.927 --> 01:30:34.762 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION BENEFITS

01:30:34.829 --> 01:30:36.564 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NOT EVERY TRANSPORTATION PROJECT

01:30:36.631 --> 01:30:38.199 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
CAN ACHIEVE THAT AT THE LEVEL

01:30:38.266 --> 01:30:39.500 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
THAT THAT THIS ONE CANCER

01:30:39.567 --> 01:30:41.068 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THERE'S ALSO INAPPROPRIATENESS.

01:30:41.135 --> 01:30:42.637 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
TO THOSE FUNDS BEING USED FOR

01:30:42.703 --> 01:30:43.104 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THIS PROJECT IN IN OUR

01:30:43.171 --> 01:30:44.472 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:28%
ESTIMATION.

01:30:44.539 --> 01:30:45.540 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THANK YOU IS IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:30:45.606 --> 01:30:46.774 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
ME THAT AND I THINK THE

01:30:46.841 --> 01:30:48.442 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
COMMITTEE TO HERE YOUR YOUR HOW

01:30:48.509 --> 01:30:49.510 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
HOW YOU LAY THAT OUT LIKE WHY

01:30:49.577 --> 01:30:50.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHEN WE'RE CONFRONTED WITH THE

01:30:50.778 --> 01:30:52.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
QUESTION SHOULD WE STOP.

01:30:52.446 --> 01:30:54.448 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
WHAT DO ONE OF THE CENTRAL PART

01:30:54.515 --> 01:30:55.483 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF YOUR ANSWER WAS THAT IT'S

01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:57.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GOING TO BE MORE THERE'S GONNA

01:30:57.084 --> 01:30:58.252 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
BE IMPROVE MOBILITY?

01:30:58.319 --> 01:31:00.188 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
THAT COMPARED TO A CAR.

01:31:00.254 --> 01:31:01.823 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
HIGH SPEED RAIL WILL GO FASTER.

01:31:01.889 --> 01:31:03.391 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THERE HAVE BEEN CRITICISMS

01:31:03.457 --> 01:31:04.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND ANOTHER WILL HEAR THEM ALL

01:31:04.759 --> 01:31:05.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OUT HERE ABOUT JUST HOW MUCH

01:31:05.893 --> 01:31:06.961 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HIGH SPEED RAIL WILL BE HIGH

01:31:07.028 --> 01:31:09.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SPEED WHETHER ITS SHARING RIGHTS

01:31:09.096 --> 01:31:09.864 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF WAY WHETHER SHARON TO FOR

01:31:09.931 --> 01:31:12.300 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
TRACK. AND STATE THE COMPARISON

01:31:12.366 --> 01:31:13.334 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
FIRST OF FIRST OF ALL THAT IT

01:31:13.401 --> 01:31:15.703 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
WILL BE TWO TO THREE HOURS.

01:31:15.770 --> 01:31:16.771 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AT LEAST IN THE PUBLIC THAT IS

01:31:16.838 --> 01:31:17.905 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
REALLY GREATLY THAT THE

01:31:17.972 --> 01:31:18.739 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
CREDIBILITY OF THAT HAS.

01:31:18.806 --> 01:31:20.975 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:38%
IT'S BEEN LOST.

01:31:21.042 --> 01:31:22.476 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
AND THAT THE COMPARISON IS WITH

01:31:22.543 --> 01:31:23.845 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
A VEHICLE WHEN WE HAVE

01:31:23.911 --> 01:31:24.979 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
TECHNOLOGY THAT'S MOVING

01:31:25.046 --> 01:31:27.014 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
FORWARDS AND SO MANY WAYS YOU

01:31:27.081 --> 01:31:28.749 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
CAN COMMENT ON THAT AS WELL AS.

01:31:28.816 --> 01:31:30.551 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
YOU KNOW BAY AREA MOBILITY OR

01:31:30.618 --> 01:31:32.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LOS ANGELES OR SAN DIEGO ABILITY

01:31:32.954 --> 01:31:33.955 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THAT THE AMOUNT OF MOBILITY

01:31:34.021 --> 01:31:35.356 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PERMITS WE CAN MAKE WITH THESE

01:31:35.423 --> 01:31:37.358 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
DOLLARS MIGHT NOT BE FROM LA TO

01:31:37.425 --> 01:31:39.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SAN FRANCISCO BUT MIGHT BE ALL

01:31:39.327 --> 01:31:41.629 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
AROUND THE GREATER BAY AREA ALL

01:31:41.696 --> 01:31:42.230 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
AROUND THE CENTRAL VALLEY ALL

01:31:42.296 --> 01:31:42.897 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:18%
AROUND.

01:31:42.964 --> 01:31:44.398 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
LOS ANGELES AND SAN DIEGO AND

01:31:44.465 --> 01:31:45.666 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE THEY

01:31:45.733 --> 01:31:47.034 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
JUST WOULDN'T BE SPENT ON HIGH

01:31:47.101 --> 01:31:49.403 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SPEED RAIL SO TO ME. I ALSO LOOK

01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:50.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FOR THE GREATER MOBILITY FOR

01:31:51.005 --> 01:31:52.840 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CALIFORNIANS JUST I DON'T SEE IT

01:31:52.907 --> 01:31:54.775 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AS THE ONLY WAY TO HAVE IT IS.

01:31:54.842 --> 01:31:55.843 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THROUGH THIS PROJECT I THINK

01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:56.811 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
IT'S MORE OF A STATEMENT THAN A

01:31:56.878 --> 01:31:58.379 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
QUESTION ON THE FIRST ONE NOW I

01:31:58.446 --> 01:32:00.815 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT.

01:32:00.882 --> 01:32:02.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE COMPARISON YOU'RE MAKING

01:32:02.083 --> 01:32:02.683 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A TWO TO

01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:04.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THREE HOUR RIDE FROM LA TO SAN

01:32:04.218 --> 01:32:06.354 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
FRANCISCO. WHEN SO MANY OTHER

01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:08.189 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
PROMISES ABOUT THE PROJECT HAVE

01:32:08.256 --> 01:32:10.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
FAILED TO BE KEPT.

01:32:10.591 --> 01:32:12.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WELL I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW

01:32:12.226 --> 01:32:13.694 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OUR OPERATING GUIDELINE IN THE

01:32:13.761 --> 01:32:14.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
FOLKS WHO.

01:32:14.595 --> 01:32:16.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DO THE OPERATION DESIGN WORK

01:32:16.297 --> 01:32:18.232 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOR THIS PROJECT ARE GUIDED BY

01:32:18.299 --> 01:32:20.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE REQUIREMENTS PROP ONE A. LOT

01:32:20.067 --> 01:32:21.535 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND THAT IS A DESIGN REQUIREMENT

01:32:21.602 --> 01:32:22.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
TO.

01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:24.672 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
BE ABLE TO TO.

01:32:24.739 --> 01:32:26.107 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OPERATE THE SYSTEM THAT IT

01:32:26.173 --> 01:32:27.541 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
TOURISM FORTY MINUTES BETWEEN

01:32:27.608 --> 01:32:29.210 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CHANCES GOING LOS ANGELES.

01:32:29.277 --> 01:32:30.544 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
ISN'T DESIGNED MATTER WE WILL

01:32:30.611 --> 01:32:32.246 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
DESIGN TO THAT WILL HAVE A

01:32:32.313 --> 01:32:33.681 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
SYSTEM THAT WILL HAVE DIFFERENT

01:32:33.748 --> 01:32:35.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
STATION STOPS.

01:32:35.149 --> 01:32:35.516 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
SO.

01:32:35.583 --> 01:32:37.285 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT WILL BE IT WILL BE DESIGNED

01:32:37.351 --> 01:32:38.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO MEET THE CRITERIA PROP ONE IS

01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:41.322 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
NOT RACIONAL MATTER IT MAY TAKE

01:32:41.389 --> 01:32:42.657 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
A LITTLE LONGER WAS STATION

01:32:42.723 --> 01:32:44.425 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STOPS TO BE SAFE THREE HOURS. OF

01:32:44.492 --> 01:32:45.626 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
TO GO FROM SEPSIS COULD A LOS

01:32:45.693 --> 01:32:48.162 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
ANGELES BUT AGAIN VERSES YOUR

01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:49.864 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
TRAVEL OPTIONS TODAY FAIRY THAN

01:32:49.931 --> 01:32:51.032 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:38%
A TRAIN OR CAR.

01:32:51.098 --> 01:32:52.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE.

01:32:52.833 --> 01:32:53.968 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
CONFERENCE ARE HOW MUCH

01:32:54.035 --> 01:32:55.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CONFIDENCE DO YOU HAVE THAT IT'S

01:32:55.336 --> 01:32:56.704 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
GOING TO BE TWO HOURS AND FORTY

01:32:56.771 --> 01:32:57.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MINUTES TO THREE HOURS WHEN THIS

01:32:57.805 --> 01:33:00.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
IS BUILT THIS CAN BE YOU

01:33:00.074 --> 01:33:00.641 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
PERSONALLY I UP YOUR CONFIDENCE

01:33:00.708 --> 01:33:00.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
IN.

01:33:00.875 --> 01:33:02.743 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WELL AGAIN THE DESIGN CRITERIA

01:33:02.810 --> 01:33:04.045 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IS THE TWO HOURS AND FORTY

01:33:04.111 --> 01:33:05.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
MINUTES TO TRAVEL TIME WAS

01:33:05.112 --> 01:33:06.614 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
STATION STOPS WOULD BE HIGHER

01:33:06.681 --> 01:33:08.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THAN THAT OKAY BUT I I'M

01:33:08.249 --> 01:33:09.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
CONFIDENT.

01:33:09.083 --> 01:33:11.152 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CERTAINLY THAT WILL BE IN A TO

01:33:11.218 --> 01:33:13.087 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FORTY TO YOU KNOW THREE TWENTY

01:33:13.154 --> 01:33:14.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
ARISE AND.

01:33:14.188 --> 01:33:15.489 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
FROM SOME DEPENDING ON HOW TO

01:33:15.556 --> 01:33:16.290 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
STOP TO MAKE YOU WHICH

01:33:16.357 --> 01:33:17.959 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
STRAIGHTER ON EXPRESS SOURCES

01:33:18.025 --> 01:33:19.961 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
NOT EXPRESS.

01:33:20.027 --> 01:33:22.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
AM.

01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:23.898 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
IT AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

01:33:23.965 --> 01:33:24.999 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THIS HAS THAT THERE'S BEEN SO

01:33:25.066 --> 01:33:26.434 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
MUCH SKEPTICISM ABOUT THE SPEED

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:28.102 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BECAUSE WE'RE COMPARING YEAH

01:33:28.169 --> 01:33:29.603 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DIFFERENT ERA IS THE SHARED YOUR

01:33:29.670 --> 01:33:31.872 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LINES YES. AND YOU HAVE EXAMPLES

01:33:31.939 --> 01:33:33.307 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
OF HOW FAST YOU CAN GO ON A

01:33:33.374 --> 01:33:34.175 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
SHARED LINE YES.

01:33:34.241 --> 01:33:36.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IN THE AREAS WERE IN URBAN

01:33:36.177 --> 01:33:36.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AREAS AND WE HAVE SHARED

01:33:37.044 --> 01:33:39.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
CORRIDORS LIKE IN THE.

01:33:39.113 --> 01:33:40.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BURBANK TO ANAHEIM AREA AND IN

01:33:41.015 --> 01:33:42.016 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND

01:33:42.083 --> 01:33:43.384 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:23%
CALTRAIN.

01:33:43.451 --> 01:33:44.218 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
STRETCH.

01:33:44.285 --> 01:33:46.354 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU KNOW FOR STRETCHES OF THAT

01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:48.189 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THE IN THOSE RELATIVELY SMALL

01:33:48.255 --> 01:33:50.624 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
STRETCHES OF OF MOVEMENT WILL

01:33:50.691 --> 01:33:51.959 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
TRAVEL BETWEEN HUNDRED TEN.

01:33:52.026 --> 01:33:53.327 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
UNDER TWENTY FIVE MILES PER HOUR

01:33:53.394 --> 01:33:54.495 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE.

01:33:54.562 --> 01:33:56.530 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BUT THE BULK OF THE TRAVEL

01:33:56.597 --> 01:33:57.765 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THROUGH THE CENTRAL VALLEY WILL

01:33:57.832 --> 01:33:58.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
BE IN EXCESS

01:33:58.366 --> 01:34:00.201 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
OF TO MILES PER HOUR.

01:34:00.267 --> 01:34:01.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WELL IT AND A SLIGHTLY VARIOUS

01:34:01.736 --> 01:34:03.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CENTRIC YEAH THINKING OF THE THE

01:34:03.337 --> 01:34:04.972 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
SAN JOSE AREA OF SAN JOSE AND

01:34:05.039 --> 01:34:07.875 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GILROY YOURS ALL ALONG THAT.

01:34:07.942 --> 01:34:08.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
THAT LINE.

01:34:08.209 --> 01:34:09.043 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:03%
.

01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:10.578 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
HOW FAST IS THAT GONNA GO THINK

01:34:10.644 --> 01:34:12.546 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ONE TEN IS OUR ESTIMATE TODAY?

01:34:12.613 --> 01:34:14.048 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
AND WHEN YOU MENTION THAT STE

01:34:14.115 --> 01:34:15.182 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
IT'S WHERE THEY WERE COMING

01:34:15.249 --> 01:34:16.784 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
HEARING IS BECAUSE PROP ONE A

01:34:16.851 --> 01:34:18.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
SAID IT HAS TO BE.

01:34:18.652 --> 01:34:19.320 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ABOUT THREE HOURS WE HAVE BE

01:34:19.387 --> 01:34:20.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ATTEMPTED DESIGNED THAT WAY IT'S

01:34:20.488 --> 01:34:22.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
GOING TO BE.

IS FOR TWO HOURS AND FORTY

01:34:32.533 --> 01:34:34.068 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
MINUTES AYE CRITERIA WE'RE

01:35:04.799 --> 01:35:08.102 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
AS TO BE DEALT WITH IN IT ON MY

01:35:08.169 --> 01:35:10.371 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LIKE. WHAT YOU'RE WHERE YOU'RE

01:35:10.438 --> 01:35:12.306 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:28%
FOCUSED ON?

01:35:12.373 --> 01:35:13.340 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:33%
IN THAT AREA.

01:35:13.407 --> 01:35:15.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND ONE EXAMPLE IS THE BURBANK

01:35:15.242 --> 01:35:16.777 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:28%
TO ANAHEIM.

01:35:16.844 --> 01:35:17.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
SEGMENT.

01:35:17.945 --> 01:35:20.181 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
WHICH.

01:35:20.247 --> 01:35:23.717 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
EVEN IF THE LINE NEVER.

01:35:23.784 --> 01:35:25.886 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
GETS OVER THE TEHACHAPI HE'S.

01:35:25.953 --> 01:35:28.322 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
WHICH IS MY REAL QUESTION IS.

01:35:28.389 --> 01:35:29.790 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
HIS IS THAT CHALLENGE OF.

01:35:29.857 --> 01:35:32.026 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
TUNNELING OR GOING OVER THE

01:35:32.093 --> 01:35:33.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
TEHACHAPI MOUNTAINS FROM

01:35:33.327 --> 01:35:35.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
PALMDALE TO BURBANK.

01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:38.532 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
ON I LIKE THE IMPROVEMENTS FROM

01:35:38.599 --> 01:35:40.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BURBANK TO ANAHEIM. BUT IT'S

01:35:40.134 --> 01:35:42.069 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:33%
REALLY NOT A.

01:35:42.136 --> 01:35:44.138 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:43%
STATEWIDE SYSTEM.

01:35:44.205 --> 01:35:46.307 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND DOESN'T MEDIAN TEN OF THE OF

01:35:46.373 --> 01:35:48.209 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:28%
THE VOTERS.

01:35:48.275 --> 01:35:49.977 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:43%
IF IT NEVER GETS.

01:35:50.044 --> 01:35:52.847 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
FROM BAKERSFIELD TO LA. OR.

01:35:52.913 --> 01:35:55.015 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:03%
.

01:35:55.082 --> 01:35:58.519 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
PAPPOINTS PALMDALE EXCUSE BUT.

BURBANK.

01:36:00.855 --> 01:36:03.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAS THERE BEEN ANY PROGRESS.

01:36:03.257 --> 01:36:05.059 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:38%
THE TECHNOLOGY.

01:36:05.126 --> 01:36:07.962 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
OR WORTH THE COST BENEFIT

01:36:08.028 --> 01:36:10.297 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:23%
ANALYSIS.

01:36:10.364 --> 01:36:11.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
FOR THAT LINK.

01:36:12.066 --> 01:36:13.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BECAUSE ALL THE READING I'VE

01:36:13.901 --> 01:36:15.202 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:13%
DONE.

01:36:15.269 --> 01:36:16.904 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
IT SEEMS TO BE GETTING.

01:36:16.971 --> 01:36:18.339 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
MORRELL MORE COMPLICATED MORE

01:36:18.405 --> 01:36:20.374 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
AND MORE CHALLENGING.

01:36:20.441 --> 01:36:23.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
MAY BE COST PROHIBITIVE.

01:36:23.310 --> 01:36:24.111 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:33%
AS SOON AS A.

01:36:24.178 --> 01:36:26.380 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:03%
.

01:36:26.447 --> 01:36:27.715 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
ELECTED OFFICIAL INIS SOMEONE

01:36:27.781 --> 01:36:28.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHO LOOKS TO HOW MUCH THINGS

01:36:28.782 --> 01:36:30.417 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:13%
COST.

01:36:30.484 --> 01:36:33.587 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
TO GET FROM PALMDALE TO BURBANK

01:36:33.654 --> 01:36:36.157 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NOT TO MENTION THE NIMBY ASPECTS

01:36:36.223 --> 01:36:38.192 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IN OTHER OPPOSITION BUT JUST

01:36:38.259 --> 01:36:40.060 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THAT DOLLARS IN SO ANY PROGRESS

01:36:40.127 --> 01:36:41.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
ON THAT.

01:36:41.996 --> 01:36:43.531 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YET WHAT WE CONTINUE TO MOVE

01:36:43.597 --> 01:36:45.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FORWARD ON ASSESSING DIFFERENT

01:36:45.466 --> 01:36:45.699 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:28%
ALIGNMENTS.

01:36:45.766 --> 01:36:47.268 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
THERE WILL CERTAINLY BE A

01:36:47.334 --> 01:36:48.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
TUNNELING.

01:36:48.269 --> 01:36:49.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
THROUGH.

01:36:49.570 --> 01:36:51.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THE TO DETACH APPEASE.

01:36:51.539 --> 01:36:53.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I THINK WE HAVE ON THE ORDER OF.

01:36:54.041 --> 01:36:55.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A MORE THAN ONE TUNNEL I THINK

01:36:55.476 --> 01:36:57.411 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WITH A FIFTEEN MILE AN EIGHT

01:36:57.478 --> 01:36:57.611 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:13%
MILE.

01:36:57.678 --> 01:36:58.646 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:18%
TUNNEL.

01:36:58.712 --> 01:37:01.582 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YEAH IN THAT IN THAT STRETCH SO.

01:37:01.649 --> 01:37:03.684 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EIGHT AND LOOK IT WHILE IT'S A

01:37:03.751 --> 01:37:06.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LITTLE UNCOMMON AND PERHAPS IN

01:37:06.287 --> 01:37:07.688 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AMERICAN CERTAINLY CALIFORNIA.

01:37:07.755 --> 01:37:09.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FOR THAT LEVEL OF TUNNELING.

01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:11.292 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
IT IS ACHIEVED THE AROUND THE

01:37:11.358 --> 01:37:13.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WORLD A THIRTY THREE MILE TUNNEL

01:37:13.861 --> 01:37:14.695 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
JUST RECENTLY OPENED IN

01:37:14.762 --> 01:37:15.462 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
SWITZERLAND.

01:37:15.529 --> 01:37:16.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEY BUILD A TUNNELING THROUGH

01:37:17.031 --> 01:37:18.632 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
MOUNT A SERIES FOR HIGH SPEED

01:37:18.699 --> 01:37:19.533 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
RAIL ALL OVER THE GLOBE WHERE

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:20.334 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:33%
THEY HAVE IT.

01:37:20.401 --> 01:37:22.703 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
AND WE WILL BE UTILIZING OF

01:37:22.770 --> 01:37:24.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT KIND OF EXPERTISE WHEN WE

01:37:24.071 --> 01:37:25.272 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
LOOK AT OUR OPTIONS.

01:37:25.339 --> 01:37:27.408 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
A HERE SO WE HAVE THREE

01:37:27.474 --> 01:37:28.342 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES FROM THE

01:37:28.409 --> 01:37:31.078 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PALMDALE TO BURBANK SCENARIO ALL

01:37:31.145 --> 01:37:33.247 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
OF THEM. HAVE TOTALING ELEMENTS

01:37:33.314 --> 01:37:35.416 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IN THEM AND THEY ARE INCLUDED IN

01:37:35.482 --> 01:37:37.318 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THE COST ESTIMATES THAT ARE PER

01:37:37.384 --> 01:37:37.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PRESENTED IN THE IN THE BUSINESS

01:37:38.018 --> 01:37:38.786 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:13%
PLAN.

01:37:38.852 --> 01:37:41.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT IT'S TRUE THAT THIS IS WHY

01:37:41.322 --> 01:37:41.956 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE MOVE

01:37:42.022 --> 01:37:43.591 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FORWARD ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND

01:37:43.657 --> 01:37:45.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE FURTHER REFINE. THE DESIGN OF

01:37:45.593 --> 01:37:47.328 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:33%
THE SEGMENTS.

01:37:47.394 --> 01:37:49.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BECAUSE THE COST OF THE COST

01:37:50.030 --> 01:37:51.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
LEVEL IT HAS A HIGH SWING.

01:37:51.599 --> 01:37:52.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IT COULD BE AS LOW AS TWELVE

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.702 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HOURS HIGHS TWENTY FIVE TO GET

01:37:54.768 --> 01:37:57.504 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:73%
THROUGH THAT THAT SECTION AND
SO.

01:37:57.571 --> 01:37:59.039 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:48%
YOU DO THINGS LIKE.

OF OF THAT YOU BRING IN

01:38:02.743 --> 01:38:05.246 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EXPERTISE TO. A PROVIDE OPTIONS.

01:38:06.113 --> 01:38:07.615 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
TO TO MOVE THROUGH THEIR.

01:38:07.681 --> 01:38:08.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
AND YOU CAN'T YOU KNOW

01:38:08.983 --> 01:38:10.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CONSTRUCTING AWAY USING THE BEST

01:38:10.851 --> 01:38:12.152 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY TO.

01:38:12.219 --> 01:38:13.721 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:28%
TO PROVIDE.

SOVIET IF YOU KNOW THERE'S

01:41:35.956 --> 01:41:37.958 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THERE'S AN ESTIMATE OF THAT THE

COULD BE MUCH HIGHER IN THE OUT

01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:41.195 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YEARS SO WE BE HIGHER I GUESS.

01:41:41.261 --> 01:41:42.095 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

AND.

01:42:55.002 --> 01:42:56.570 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:03%

01:42:56.637 --> 01:42:57.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOME OF THE EXPENSE OF LESSONS

01:42:57.704 --> 01:42:59.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
LEARNED.

01:42:59.806 --> 01:43:00.240 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
IT WAS THE RIGHT OF WAY

01:43:00.307 --> 01:43:01.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
ACQUISITION.

01:43:01.909 --> 01:43:03.410 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HOW WAS YOUR PURPOSEFULLY P.

01:43:03.477 --> 01:43:05.212 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD I MEAN WHAT

01:43:05.279 --> 01:43:06.880 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
I'M A CONTRACTOR ALWAYS?

PROPERTY NEVER OWNED.

01:43:09.917 --> 01:43:10.984 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK ABOUT THIS

01:43:11.051 --> 01:43:12.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SIERRA KIND HAS THE CONCEPT OF

01:43:12.986 --> 01:43:14.288 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
BUILDING THE PLANE ON THE

THEY WERE TOLD.

01:43:32.506 --> 01:43:34.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND SO. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO

01:43:34.441 --> 01:43:36.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MOVING FORWARD TO ACQUIRE THIS

01:43:37.044 --> 01:43:38.178 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
AND AND OTHER APPROPRIATE

01:43:38.245 --> 01:43:40.614 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
FASHION THAT ALSO? IS A VALUE

AS A -- -- PLANNING -- MATTER

01:47:31.411 --> 01:47:32.379 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
TRYING TO ESTIMATE WHAT WOULD

01:47:37.918 --> 01:47:40.353 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
PLUGGED IN HERE SO IF WE WERE

01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:41.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO REPLACE THE PERCENTAGE WITH

01:47:41.822 --> 01:47:43.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A DOLLAR SIGN AND WE WANTED TO

01:47:43.590 --> 01:47:44.791 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MAKE IT FINANCES WILL WE WOULD

01:47:44.858 --> 01:47:45.725 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WANT TO TRY TO MAKE THAT A

01:47:45.792 --> 01:47:47.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FLOOR OF SOME KIND BUT WHETHER

01:47:47.661 --> 01:47:49.629 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THAT WAS -- WHETHER THE FLOOR

01:47:49.696 --> 01:47:52.499 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
WAS -- SOME COMMITMENT WAS MADE

01:47:52.566 --> 01:47:54.334 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
FROM OTHER CAP AND TRADE MONIES

01:47:54.401 --> 01:47:56.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OR SOMETHING ELSE REMAINS TO

IN GENERAL FUND COMMITMENT

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:01.875 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SO THEN I DID AGAIN IF WE'RE

01:48:01.942 --> 01:48:03.143 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
IDENTIFYING A NUMBER IS ONE

01:48:03.210 --> 01:48:04.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF THOSE WHO'S GOING TO BE THE

01:48:04.311 --> 01:48:06.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BACKSTOPS A ONE OF THE OTHER

01:48:06.146 --> 01:48:07.147 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

DIMINISHING AMOUNT OF MONEY

01:48:12.619 --> 01:48:13.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT COMES IN BECAUSE YOU'RE

01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:16.423 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
USING IT FOR MITIGATION AND AS

01:48:16.489 --> 01:48:18.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
A RESULT -- ACQUIRE THAT YOU

DON'T NEED AS MUCH MONEY COMING

01:48:19.893 --> 01:48:21.828 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%

SO

01:49:39.706 --> 01:49:41.541 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
WE MADE A COMMITMENT TO

01:49:41.608 --> 01:49:44.144 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ON THIS

01:49:44.210 --> 01:49:47.080 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
PROJECT WHOSE COMPANIES

I WHEN I WALK THAT PROJECT IN

01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:57.090 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
ACTUALLY HA THE ARTISTRY OF

01:49:57.157 --> 01:49:58.925 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THE WORKERS IS UNBELIEVABLE

01:49:58.992 --> 01:50:03.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
IT'S IT'S FANTASTIC --

01:50:03.229 --> 01:50:04.497 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND WE'RE GOING TO SAY WE'VE

01:50:04.564 --> 01:50:05.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
MADE A COMMITMENT TO THESE

01:50:05.865 --> 01:50:07.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PEOPLE LIVE ACTUALLY RELOCATED

01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:08.902 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
TO BE ABLE TO WORK ON THESE

01:50:08.969 --> 01:50:12.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AREAS -- IN FROM THE TRADES IN

01:50:12.872 --> 01:50:14.507 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND AND AND VENDORS AND WHAT

01:50:14.574 --> 01:50:18.278 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
NOT OF SO WE LOOK AT THE VIEW

01:50:18.345 --> 01:50:20.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OF THE BUSINESS PLAN AND I

01:50:20.413 --> 01:50:22.782 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
DON'T SEE ANYTHING WHAT ABOUT

01:50:22.849 --> 01:50:25.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE DEBT SERVICE THERE WOULD

01:50:25.218 --> 01:50:26.786 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
HAVE TO CREATE THAT WOULD

01:50:26.853 --> 01:50:28.555 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAVE TO BE PAID ON ANY MONEY

01:50:28.621 --> 01:50:31.458 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FAR SO WE LOOK AT IT WILL IT

01:50:31.524 --> 01:50:33.693 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS

01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:35.161 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE DON'T GET FEDERAL FUNDING

01:50:35.228 --> 01:50:37.931 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
AND WE DON'T GET -- PRIVATE

01:50:37.998 --> 01:50:40.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PARTNERSHIP AND SO NOW WE HAVE

01:50:40.166 --> 01:50:41.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR

01:50:42.002 --> 01:50:44.838 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THAT WELL IN OVER THIRTY YEAR

01:50:44.904 --> 01:50:46.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PERIOD OF TIME IT WOULD COST

01:50:46.272 --> 01:50:48.241 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
US ACT IT'S ALWAYS LIKE TO SEE

01:50:48.308 --> 01:50:50.276 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE LOOK AT THE TOTAL BURDEN

01:50:50.343 --> 01:50:53.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF THE PROJECT AND SO YOU KNOW

01:50:53.113 --> 01:50:54.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I THINK THAT'S AN OBLIGATION

01:50:54.714 --> 01:50:56.750 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
WE HAVE AS LEGISLATORS TO

01:50:56.816 --> 01:50:58.084 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE

01:50:58.151 --> 01:50:59.252 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PACKAGE IT TELLING US WHAT'S

01:50:59.319 --> 01:51:02.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND COST REAL TIME DOLLARS BUT

01:51:02.188 --> 01:51:03.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NOT THIRTY YEARS THAT THE DEBT

01:51:03.790 --> 01:51:06.126 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT WERE OCCURRING FOR FUTURE

01:51:06.192 --> 01:51:07.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
LEGISLATURE'S WOMEN PEOPLE

01:51:07.927 --> 01:51:09.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT O'NEILL GOING FORWARD

01:51:09.763 --> 01:51:11.564 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
SO THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE

01:51:11.631 --> 01:51:14.034 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
INCLUDED A AND THEN ALSO YOU

01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:15.702 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
KNOW I HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:51:15.769 --> 01:51:17.504 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
WHAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL I MEAN

01:51:17.570 --> 01:51:18.438 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE

01:51:18.505 --> 01:51:19.672 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS ON THIS

01:51:19.739 --> 01:51:22.442 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
PROJECT WORDS ASTRONOMICAL OF

01:51:22.509 --> 01:51:24.844 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IT ALL AND THE CLEAR BENEFIT

01:51:24.911 --> 01:51:26.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT THIS PROJECT DOES BRING

01:51:26.112 --> 01:51:29.149 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
FOR REDUCTIONS EVENTUALLY

01:51:29.215 --> 01:51:31.084 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
HOW THAT THERE'S BEEN NO OF

01:51:31.151 --> 01:51:33.753 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
CREDIT GIVEN UP IN IN THE

01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:35.321 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECT GOING

01:51:35.388 --> 01:51:36.489 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FORWARD YOU KNOW IT'S JUST

01:51:36.556 --> 01:51:38.224 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THOSE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT

01:51:38.291 --> 01:51:40.393 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT MAN UNITED YOU KNOW HOW

01:51:40.460 --> 01:51:42.495 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE EARLY DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:51:42.562 --> 01:51:43.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE EXORBITANT COST OF THE

01:51:43.997 --> 01:51:45.098 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
ENVIRONMENT AND WE ACTUALLY

01:51:45.165 --> 01:51:47.333 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING

01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:49.502 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THAT IS ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND

01:51:49.569 --> 01:51:51.504 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF A KIND

01:51:51.571 --> 01:51:54.774 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF AN OXYMORON REALLY -- BUT

01:51:54.841 --> 01:51:56.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT NEARLY CLOSER SOME OF

01:51:56.176 --> 01:51:57.343 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THINGS BUT IN IN THE DRAFT IS

01:51:57.410 --> 01:51:58.445 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
BUT I THINK WE NEED TO SEE REAL

01:51:58.511 --> 01:52:01.114 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
TIME NUMBERS OKAY OF JUST ONE

01:52:01.181 --> 01:52:02.215 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
COMMENT ON THAT MR CHAIRMAN

01:52:02.282 --> 01:52:04.017 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THERE IS A A CHART OF THE COSTS

01:52:04.084 --> 01:52:07.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SECTION IN THAT CHART IT NOTES

01:52:07.220 --> 01:52:08.688 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
-- HOW MUCH CAP AND TRADE WOULD

01:52:08.755 --> 01:52:10.623 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
HAVE FOR CAPITAL COSTS THE

01:52:10.690 --> 01:52:11.858 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ACTUAL AMOUNT WE WOULD BRING

01:52:11.925 --> 01:52:13.693 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
IN IS IN EXCESS OF THAT BUT

01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:14.828 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AS YOU KNOW SOME OF IT WOULD

01:52:14.894 --> 01:52:16.362 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
BE PAID FOR FINANCING BECAUSE

01:52:16.429 --> 01:52:17.197 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AGAIN WE WANT TO BRING THE

01:52:17.263 --> 01:52:18.598 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
DOLLARS RIGHT FOR TO MEET OUR

01:52:18.665 --> 01:52:20.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CAPITAL EXPENSES SO IT WOULD

01:52:20.767 --> 01:52:22.235 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WE WOULD ACTUALLY GENERATE

01:52:22.302 --> 01:52:23.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MORE THAN THAT THE AMOUNT OF

01:52:24.037 --> 01:52:25.205 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THE CAPITAL COSTS BUT AGAIN

01:52:25.271 --> 01:52:27.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE WOULD PROPOSE TO FINANCE WE

01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:28.541 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CAN GET THE WORK DONE SAID ONE

01:52:28.608 --> 01:52:29.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE ALSO KNOW THAT PICKED AS IT

01:52:29.976 --> 01:52:32.579 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
GETS MORE COSTLY AS TIME GOES

01:52:32.645 --> 01:52:34.114 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
ON BECAUSE WE HAVE WHICH IS THE

01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:35.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GO UP IN COSTA MATERIALS AND

01:52:36.015 --> 01:52:38.284 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
AND AND AND PURCHASED INFLATION

01:52:38.351 --> 01:52:42.088 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
-- WE HAVE TO BE CONSCIOUS OF

01:52:42.155 --> 01:52:43.990 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THE FACT OF IS IT GOING TO BE

01:52:44.057 --> 01:52:47.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AFFORDABLE TO UTILIZE I MEAN

01:52:47.327 --> 01:52:48.595 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THERE'S NO PUBLIC SUBSIDIES

01:52:48.661 --> 01:52:51.264 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
AROUND US IN THE BOND MEASURE

01:52:51.331 --> 01:52:54.234 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
AND SO I MEAN I I THINK I

01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:55.335 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SAW SOMETHING WAS NINETY

01:52:55.401 --> 01:52:57.170 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
ONE DOLLARS AND AND THERE'S

01:52:57.237 --> 01:52:58.104 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
NOTHING MORE THAT I WANT TO

01:52:58.171 --> 01:52:59.272 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
CENTRAL VALLEY HAVE THE FIELD

01:52:59.339 --> 01:53:00.406 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%

OTHER IS SOME COMMENTS ON DE

02:10:37.963 --> 02:10:39.364 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
YET OF THE CONTENT WITH THE

02:10:39.431 --> 02:10:41.033 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
PLAN ITSELF AND I REALLY WANT

02:10:41.099 --> 02:10:42.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO FOCUS FIRST ON THE POLICY

02:10:42.834 --> 02:10:44.303 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
ISSUES BECAUSE I THINK THEY ARE

02:10:44.369 --> 02:10:47.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MUCH MORE IMPORTANT WE BELIEVE

02:10:47.139 --> 02:10:49.041 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THAT THE HIGH SPEED PROJECT HAS

02:10:49.107 --> 02:10:50.776 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
NOW REACHED A CRITICAL POINT

02:10:50.842 --> 02:10:52.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHERE DIFFICULT DECISIONS NEED

02:10:52.711 --> 02:10:54.313 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO BE MADE ABOUT THE PROJECT

02:10:54.379 --> 02:10:56.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FUTURE SCOPE AND FUNDING QUITE

02:10:56.949 --> 02:10:59.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SIMPLY AS A RESULT OF COST

02:10:59.251 --> 02:11:00.719 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
INCREASES IN CHANGES IN THE

02:11:00.786 --> 02:11:02.554 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
FUNDING SOURCES THE AUTHORITY

02:11:02.621 --> 02:11:04.523 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
CAN NO LONGER COMPLETE THE LINK

02:11:04.590 --> 02:11:06.959 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
FROM CENTRAL VALLEY EITHER TO

02:11:07.025 --> 02:11:09.094 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THE LA BASIN ORDER SAN JOSE

02:11:09.161 --> 02:11:11.530 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
IN THE FINANCIAL THE US AS IT

02:11:11.597 --> 02:11:13.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
STANDS TODAY THERE IS LITTLE

02:11:13.265 --> 02:11:14.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PROSPECT FOR A SYSTEM THAT

02:11:14.700 --> 02:11:15.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WOULD GENERATE ENOUGH CASH

02:11:15.901 --> 02:11:17.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FLOW TO CONTRIBUTE TO FUTURE

02:11:17.436 --> 02:11:19.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
INVESTMENT THIS DILEMMA DOES

02:11:20.005 --> 02:11:21.873 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
NOT COME AS A SURPRISE IT

02:11:21.940 --> 02:11:23.875 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAPPENS NEARLY EVERY TIME WE

02:11:23.942 --> 02:11:25.944 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
TRY TO TRANSLATE A MEGA PROJECT

02:11:26.011 --> 02:11:28.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FROM THE GRAND VISION INTO A

02:11:28.413 --> 02:11:30.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WORKING SYSTEM AND IT IS NOT

02:11:30.349 --> 02:11:32.184 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
NECESSARILY A REFLECTION ON

02:11:32.251 --> 02:11:33.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE CONFIDENCE OR HONESTY OF

02:11:33.719 --> 02:11:35.087 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THE PEOPLE AT THE AUTHORITY

02:11:35.153 --> 02:11:36.221 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
WHO HAVE BEEN TRYING TO BUILD

02:11:36.288 --> 02:11:38.924 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A SYSTEM THE CRITICAL QUESTION

02:11:38.991 --> 02:11:40.192 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THOUGH IS WHERE DO WE GO FROM

02:11:40.259 --> 02:11:42.694 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
HERE THE DRAFT PLAN DOESN'T

02:11:42.761 --> 02:11:44.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REALLY LAY OUT THE CHOICES THE

02:11:44.630 --> 02:11:46.932 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
HUH IN ADDRESSING THIS QUESTION

02:11:46.999 --> 02:11:48.867 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE GROUP PLAYED OUT FOR BROAD

02:11:48.934 --> 02:11:50.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OPTIONS BUT THESE WERE MEANT

02:11:50.669 --> 02:11:52.304 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
BASIC OF YOU PROVOKE A DEBATE

02:11:52.371 --> 02:11:53.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THERE COULD BE OTHER OPTIONS

02:11:53.672 --> 02:11:55.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT ANYONE COULD ENTER INTO

02:11:55.073 --> 02:11:57.709 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THIS FIRST OPTION IS WE COULD

02:11:57.776 --> 02:12:00.579 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
JUST STOP STOP WHERE WE ARE

02:12:00.646 --> 02:12:02.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PAY ALL OF WHAT WE HAVE TO PAY

02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:05.317 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OFF AND AND CUT OUR LOSSES THE

02:12:05.384 --> 02:12:06.852 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SECOND OPTION IS THAT WE COULD

02:12:06.918 --> 02:12:08.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
COMPLETE WHAT WE'RE DOING IN

02:12:08.220 --> 02:12:10.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE CENTRAL VALLEY BASICALLY

02:12:10.188 --> 02:12:12.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND CREATE WHATEVER VALUE WE

02:12:12.891 --> 02:12:15.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COULD CREATE THEIR AND AND THE

02:12:15.193 --> 02:12:16.561 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WORK THAT'S COMMITTED ON THE

02:12:16.628 --> 02:12:19.097 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
ENDS AND STOP THERE THE THIRD

02:12:19.164 --> 02:12:21.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OPTION -- WE COULD DO WHAT

02:12:21.433 --> 02:12:23.135 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AFFECT AND EFFECT THE BUSINESS

02:12:23.201 --> 02:12:25.270 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
PLAN IS SUGGESTING WHICH IS

02:12:25.337 --> 02:12:26.571 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
COMPLETE THE CENTRAL VALLEY

02:12:26.638 --> 02:12:28.740 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
HAD THE CONNECTIONS TO GILROY

02:12:28.807 --> 02:12:30.676 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
AND BAKERSFIELD AND IMPROVE

02:12:30.742 --> 02:12:33.412 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LA UNION STATION WHILE WAITING

02:12:33.478 --> 02:12:35.347 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
TO FIND OUT WHAT DRACO PASSED

02:12:35.414 --> 02:12:36.682 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
TUNNELS ARE GOING TO COST AND

02:12:36.748 --> 02:12:38.583 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
HOW WE MIGHT GO ABOUT FINANCING

02:12:38.650 --> 02:12:41.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT OR FOURTH WE COULD REALLY

02:12:41.653 --> 02:12:43.221 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
COMMIT TO THE FULL PHASE ONE

02:12:43.288 --> 02:12:44.456 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT

02:12:44.523 --> 02:12:46.625 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
SUCH A DECISION WOULD HAVE TO

02:12:46.692 --> 02:12:48.493 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
BE BASED ON THE ADOPTION OF

02:12:48.560 --> 02:12:50.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
A CREDIBLE LONG TERM PLAN TO

02:12:50.729 --> 02:12:53.498 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FINANCE THE SYSTEM INCLUDING

02:12:53.565 --> 02:12:55.133 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THE POSSIBILITY THAT SYSTEM

02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:57.069 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
COST MIKE WILL COME IN AT

02:12:57.135 --> 02:12:59.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE HIGH END OF THE RANGE WE

02:12:59.971 --> 02:13:01.473 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
DON'T VIEW THE FIRST OPTION

02:13:01.540 --> 02:13:04.343 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
SIMPLY STOPPING AS CREDIBLE

02:13:04.409 --> 02:13:05.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT WOULD LEAVE US WITH NOTHING

02:13:05.811 --> 02:13:07.412 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
USEFUL AND WE WERE PROBABLY

02:13:07.479 --> 02:13:08.680 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
STILL HAVE TO PAY BACK THE

02:13:08.747 --> 02:13:11.350 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FEDERAL ERA MONEY THE SECOND

02:13:11.416 --> 02:13:12.517 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
OPTION STOPPING WITH THE

02:13:12.584 --> 02:13:14.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CENTRAL VALLEY PLUS A BOOK AND

02:13:14.086 --> 02:13:15.554 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
IMPROVEMENTS WOULD WORK BUT

02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:16.822 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
IT WOULD LIMIT THE VALUE OF

02:13:16.888 --> 02:13:19.257 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THE RESULT THE THIRD OPTION

02:13:19.324 --> 02:13:21.159 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
AS IN THE DRAFT PLAN PROBABLY

02:13:21.226 --> 02:13:22.794 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
MAKES THE BEST USE OF THE

02:13:22.861 --> 02:13:25.864 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
EXISTING SITUATION ESPECIALLY

02:13:25.931 --> 02:13:27.432 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN BRINGING NEAR TERM BENEFITS

02:13:27.499 --> 02:13:28.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TO THE MILLIONS OF CURRENT

02:13:28.734 --> 02:13:31.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PASSENGERS ON THE BOOKENDS BUT

02:13:31.136 --> 02:13:32.504 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IT LEAVES THE STATE SHORT OF

02:13:32.571 --> 02:13:34.039 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THE SYSTEM THAT WOULD BE ABLE

02:13:34.106 --> 02:13:35.474 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
TO CONTRIBUTE TO FINANCING OF

02:13:35.540 --> 02:13:38.577 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE REMAINDER OF THIS BEFORE

02:13:38.643 --> 02:13:39.745 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
FOURTH OPTION WHICH WOULD

02:13:39.811 --> 02:13:41.613 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
BE COMPLETING PHASE A AS

02:13:41.680 --> 02:13:43.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ORIGINALLY PLANNED DOES MEET

02:13:43.415 --> 02:13:44.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE REQUIREMENTS OF PROP ONE

02:13:44.850 --> 02:13:47.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NAY BUT IT CANNOT BE DONE WITH

02:13:47.386 --> 02:13:48.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CURRENT FUNDING PROVISIONS

02:13:48.920 --> 02:13:51.823 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ARE SOURCES SIMPLY PUT WE DO

02:13:51.890 --> 02:13:53.392 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
NOT BELIEVE THAT IT IS FAIR

02:13:53.458 --> 02:13:55.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
A CREDIBLE ANY LONGER TO ASK

02:13:55.260 --> 02:13:56.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MANAGEMENT TO DELIVER A LONG

02:13:57.028 --> 02:13:58.897 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
TERM PROJECT OF THIS SIZE AND

02:13:58.964 --> 02:14:01.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
COMPLEXITY WITH SOURCES OF

02:14:01.166 --> 02:14:02.634 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FUNDING BETTER INADEQUATE IN

02:14:02.701 --> 02:14:04.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TOTAL AND UNRELIABLE AND ANY

02:14:04.936 --> 02:14:07.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GIVEN YEAR IF THE PROJECT IS

02:14:07.539 --> 02:14:09.040 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO GO AHEAD BEYOND ESSENTIALLY

02:14:09.107 --> 02:14:10.475 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THE SECOND OPTION THE STATE

02:14:10.542 --> 02:14:11.910 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
WILL NEED TO DEVELOP A SOURCE

02:14:11.977 --> 02:14:13.345 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
OF FUNDING THAT IS UP TO

02:14:13.412 --> 02:14:16.214 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE TASK THIS IS NOT A NEW

02:14:16.281 --> 02:14:18.450 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
ISSUE THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN

02:14:18.517 --> 02:14:20.318 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
A FUNDING GAP OF SOME SIZE

02:14:20.385 --> 02:14:21.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DEPENDING ON THE ASSUMPTIONS

02:14:21.753 --> 02:14:24.122 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
ABOUT COST IN INCOME IT WAS

02:14:24.189 --> 02:14:25.924 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
CLEAR IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN

02:14:25.991 --> 02:14:27.592 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUSINESS CLASS PLAN THAT THERE

02:14:27.659 --> 02:14:29.428 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
WAS A FUNDING GAP OF AROUND

02:14:29.494 --> 02:14:30.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR

02:14:30.996 --> 02:14:32.798 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE MEDIUM ASKED MONTH AND

02:14:32.864 --> 02:14:34.099 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THERE WAS AN ADDITIONAL TEN

02:14:34.166 --> 02:14:35.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BILLION THAT WAS NEEDED TO

02:14:35.600 --> 02:14:37.803 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
GET TO THE POINT WHERE OF

02:14:37.869 --> 02:14:38.970 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
REVENUES COULD BE GENERATED

02:14:39.037 --> 02:14:40.272 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
FROM SELLING THE SERVICE

02:14:40.338 --> 02:14:42.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ITSELF IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS

02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:43.642 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
SOMEWHERE AROUND TWENTY BILLION

02:14:43.708 --> 02:14:44.843 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO GET

02:14:44.910 --> 02:14:46.545 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
TO THE POINT WHERE INVESTMENT

02:14:46.611 --> 02:14:47.913 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
MONEY FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR

02:14:47.979 --> 02:14:50.515 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
COULD BE GENERATED WHAT IS

02:14:50.582 --> 02:14:52.784 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
NEW IS THE INCREASING SIZE OF

02:14:52.851 --> 02:14:54.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE GAP ALONG WITH A CLEARER

02:14:54.352 --> 02:14:55.454 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEED

02:14:55.520 --> 02:14:56.822 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
TO MAKE THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:14:56.888 --> 02:14:59.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AUTHORITIES FUNDING STABLE AND

02:14:59.090 --> 02:15:01.460 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
PREDICTABLE THERE ARE OBVIOUS

02:15:01.526 --> 02:15:02.994 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WAYS TO DEAL WITH THIS YOU

02:15:03.061 --> 02:15:04.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COULD INCREASE TO SHARE OF CAP

02:15:04.529 --> 02:15:05.630 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
AND TRADE RECEIPTS GOING TO

02:15:05.697 --> 02:15:07.732 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THE PROJECT YOU CAN GUARANTEE

02:15:07.799 --> 02:15:09.401 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEIR INCOME OR PERMIT THEM TO

02:15:09.468 --> 02:15:10.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ISSUE SOME KIND OF GUARANTEE

02:15:10.902 --> 02:15:12.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
BLINDS AGAINST THE STATE

AGAINST PREDICTED REVENUES

02:15:13.805 --> 02:15:16.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT COULD BE A TAX ON FUELS

02:15:16.341 --> 02:15:18.176 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
LARA SALES TAX WAS PROPOSED

02:15:18.243 --> 02:15:19.478 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IN THE TWO THOUSAND BUSINESS

02:15:19.544 --> 02:15:21.913 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PLAN THERE ARE OTHER SOURCES

02:15:21.980 --> 02:15:24.015 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THAT MIGHT EMERGE LIKE FUTURE

02:15:24.082 --> 02:15:25.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FEDERAL GRANT PROGRAMS FEDERAL

02:15:25.851 --> 02:15:28.186 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LANDS IT CETERA BUT THEN AGAIN

02:15:28.253 --> 02:15:30.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THEY MIGHT NOT THE PROBLEM

02:15:30.822 --> 02:15:31.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN

02:15:32.023 --> 02:15:33.458 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ONE WHERE NO THERE IF EVEN

02:15:33.525 --> 02:15:35.460 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THE THIRD OPTION OR BEYOND IS

02:15:35.527 --> 02:15:38.196 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
TO BE COMPLETED IN PARALLEL

02:15:38.263 --> 02:15:39.397 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WITH DEALING WITH THE NEED FOR

02:15:39.464 --> 02:15:40.932 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
IMPROVED APPROACH THE FUNDING

02:15:40.999 --> 02:15:42.601 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE STATE'S

02:15:42.667 --> 02:15:45.470 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
ROLE IS LIKELY TO GO UP GROW WE

02:15:45.537 --> 02:15:47.105 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:15:47.172 --> 02:15:49.274 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
RE VALIDATE THE PRIORITY OF THE

02:15:49.341 --> 02:15:50.909 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
HIGH SPEED RAIL IN THE LIGHT OF

02:15:50.976 --> 02:15:52.544 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THE COMPETING NEEDS ELSEWHERE

02:15:52.611 --> 02:15:54.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IN THIS TRANSPORTATION TEN

02:15:54.179 --> 02:15:56.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OVER WHAT ALL AND THAT STATE'S

02:15:56.081 --> 02:15:58.283 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BUDGET THIS IS THE TASK OF

02:15:58.350 --> 02:15:59.584 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND

02:15:59.651 --> 02:16:00.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT OR

02:16:02.387 --> 02:16:04.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
COMMUNITIES AFFECTED WOULD

02:16:04.189 --> 02:16:05.657 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
BE WELL SUITED TO CARRY OUT

02:16:05.724 --> 02:16:08.393 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
FOR THE LEGISLATURE I KNOW OF

02:16:08.460 --> 02:16:09.961 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
MISTER CHAIRMAN YOUR QUESTION

02:16:10.028 --> 02:16:11.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

YOU KNOW BENEFITS OTHER THAN

02:16:13.265 --> 02:16:15.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
REVENUES AND COST THIS WAS

02:16:15.567 --> 02:16:17.102 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
ACTUALLY ADDRESSED AN EARLIER

STUDY AND HOW MUCH THAT WAS

02:16:24.209 --> 02:16:25.777 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
WORTH IT WOULDN'T BE THAT

02:16:25.844 --> 02:16:27.479 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
DIFFICULT TO RE COMMISSION THAT

02:16:27.546 --> 02:16:28.747 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
KIND OF WORK AND YOU MIGHT WANT

02:16:28.813 --> 02:16:31.883 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
TO CONSIDER WE DO HAVE SOME

02:16:31.950 --> 02:16:33.785 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SPECIFIC

CHANGES IN THE FINAL PLAN ONE

02:16:36.888 --> 02:16:38.823 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
WE BELIEVE THEY WOULD BENEFIT

02:16:38.890 --> 02:16:40.425 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FROM INCLUDING AND REPORTING

02:16:40.492 --> 02:16:41.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ON THE END OF IT INPUTS FROM

02:16:42.060 --> 02:16:43.562 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THE EARLY OPERATORS SOON AS

02:16:43.628 --> 02:16:45.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
POSSIBLE WE HAVE LONG ARGUED

02:16:45.897 --> 02:16:47.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
FOR THE INCLUSION OF THE

02:16:47.365 --> 02:16:49.367 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
ADVICE OF AN EARLY OPERATOR

02:16:49.434 --> 02:16:50.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NOW THEY'VE ACQUIRED THE EARLY

02:16:51.036 --> 02:16:52.504 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
OPERATOR WE SHOULD BEGIN TO

02:16:52.571 --> 02:16:54.005 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SEE THE INPUTS FROM THAT EARLY

02:16:54.072 --> 02:16:56.441 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OPERATORS SOON AS POSSIBLE

02:16:56.508 --> 02:16:58.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE NEED A BETTER EXPLANATION

02:16:58.143 --> 02:16:59.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OF THE BUSINESS MODEL THIS

02:16:59.411 --> 02:17:00.745 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
MAY SOUND STRANGE BUT THIS IS

02:17:00.812 --> 02:17:02.614 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
NOT A CONSTRUCTION WHAT WE'RE

02:17:02.681 --> 02:17:04.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ACTUALLY DOING IS BUILDING A

02:17:04.182 --> 02:17:05.483 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUSINESS TO SERVE THE PEOPLE

02:17:05.550 --> 02:17:07.485 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND

02:17:07.552 --> 02:17:09.287 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
YET THE BUSINESS PLAN DOESN'T

02:17:09.354 --> 02:17:10.822 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
PROVIDE THE KIND OF STRUCTURE

02:17:10.889 --> 02:17:12.257 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DESCRIPTION WE THINK SHOULD BE

02:17:12.324 --> 02:17:13.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PROVIDED UP WHAT IS IT GOING

02:17:13.758 --> 02:17:15.160 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
TO LOOK LIKE WHEN IT ACTUALLY

02:17:15.226 --> 02:17:16.695 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ARRIVES WHO'S GONNA DO WHAT TO

02:17:16.761 --> 02:17:19.464 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHOM ARE WE NEED TO PUT MORE

02:17:19.531 --> 02:17:21.266 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
EMPHASIS ON DEVELOPING DETAILED

02:17:21.333 --> 02:17:22.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AGREEMENTS WITH THE BOOK AND

02:17:22.601 --> 02:17:24.135 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OPERATORS IN THE FREIGHT REYES

02:17:24.202 --> 02:17:26.037 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
DESCEND SIMPLE IT IS ANYTHING

02:17:26.104 --> 02:17:29.107 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
BUT WHEN TWO OR THREE OPERATORS

02:17:29.174 --> 02:17:30.408 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAVE TO LIVE TOGETHER ON THE

02:17:30.475 --> 02:17:32.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SAME PIECE OF TRACK ESPECIALLY

02:17:32.177 --> 02:17:33.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FREIGHT AND COMMUTERS AND THEY

02:17:33.612 --> 02:17:35.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAVE TO DECIDE WHO GETS WHAT

02:17:35.113 --> 02:17:37.248 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PRIORITY WHO PAYS WHAT TO WHOM

02:17:37.315 --> 02:17:40.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IT IS VERY CALM AND THESE OF

02:17:40.151 --> 02:17:41.987 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THE DECISION SHOULD NOT BE LEFT

02:17:42.053 --> 02:17:44.589 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
TO LAST MINUTE THEY NEED TO

02:17:44.656 --> 02:17:46.758 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DEVELOP WE NEED TO DEVELOP AND

02:17:46.825 --> 02:17:48.994 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
I PUT THE EMPHASIS ON WE A LONG

02:17:49.060 --> 02:17:50.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
RANGE PROGRAM FOR ADDRESSING

02:17:50.595 --> 02:17:52.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GREAT CROSS ESPECIALLY BECAUSE

02:17:53.031 --> 02:17:54.599 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
MORE SERVICES NOW GOING TO BE

02:17:54.666 --> 02:17:56.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PROVIDED JOINTLY BETWEEN SAN

02:17:56.835 --> 02:17:59.671 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
JOSE AND GILROY AND AND THE

OF BURBANK TO ANAHEIM AREA

02:18:02.040 --> 02:18:03.775 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
OF MORE AND MORE ENCOUNTERS

02:18:03.842 --> 02:18:05.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ARE GONNA BE THERE BETWEEN

02:18:05.210 --> 02:18:07.646 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AUTOMOBILES OR TRUCKS OR GAS

02:18:07.712 --> 02:18:10.448 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TRUCKS AND HIGH SPEED TRAINS

02:18:10.515 --> 02:18:11.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
NOW THIS CAN'T BE SOLVED

02:18:11.750 --> 02:18:12.951 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
IMMEDIATELY AND THERE THERE'S

02:18:13.018 --> 02:18:14.486 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
NOT A PROBLEM JUST FOR THE HIGH

02:18:14.552 --> 02:18:15.787 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY IT'S A

02:18:15.854 --> 02:18:17.422 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PROBLEM FOR THEM PLUS COMMUTER

02:18:17.489 --> 02:18:18.823 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
RAILWAY SPLIT FREIGHT RAILWAYS

02:18:18.890 --> 02:18:20.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PLUS THE HIGHWAY AUTHORITIES

02:18:20.158 --> 02:18:22.127 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
PLUS EVERYBODY INVOLVED BUT

02:18:22.193 --> 02:18:24.162 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
IT SHOULD START NOW AND CAL

02:18:24.229 --> 02:18:25.897 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CALTRANS WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE

02:18:25.964 --> 02:18:28.833 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
TO ASK THAT IT BEGAN WE NEED TO

02:18:28.900 --> 02:18:30.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CLARIFY THE PERFORMANCE OF THE

02:18:30.468 --> 02:18:31.903 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SYSTEM IS SHOWN IN TRIP TIME

02:18:31.970 --> 02:18:34.305 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
CALCULATIONS AND SCHEDULES OF I

02:18:34.372 --> 02:18:36.107 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
AM INFORMED THAT THEY ARE STILL

02:18:36.174 --> 02:18:38.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TECHNICALLY CAPABLE OF MEETING

02:18:39.010 --> 02:18:40.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE TWO HOUR FORTY MINUTE TRIP

02:18:40.679 --> 02:18:42.514 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
TIME BUT I THINK CONTINUING

02:18:42.580 --> 02:18:44.482 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
OF MY ATTENTION TO THAT WOULD

02:18:44.549 --> 02:18:47.052 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
BE WORTHWHILE WE WOULD LIKE

02:18:47.118 --> 02:18:48.720 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
TO CONTINUE THE EMPHASIS ON

02:18:48.787 --> 02:18:50.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SHOWING PROJECTIONS AS RANGERS

02:18:50.855 --> 02:18:52.257 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
RATHER THAN POINT ESTIMATES

02:18:52.323 --> 02:18:53.892 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
IT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT AND

02:18:53.958 --> 02:18:54.893 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TRACK BUT I THINK IT WOULD

02:18:54.959 --> 02:18:56.661 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
BE USEFUL TO EXPAND THAT TO

02:18:56.728 --> 02:18:58.763 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
INCLUDE THE CAPITAL ESTIMATES

02:18:58.830 --> 02:19:00.365 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AS WELL SO WE CAN BEGIN TO

02:19:00.432 --> 02:19:02.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
GET A GOOD SENSE OF WHAT'S

02:19:02.400 --> 02:19:04.002 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE PROBABILITY OF VARIOUS

02:19:04.069 --> 02:19:05.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
KINDS OF OUTCOMES NOT ONLY

02:19:05.570 --> 02:19:07.038 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THE EXPECTED OUTCOME BUT WHAT

02:19:07.105 --> 02:19:09.441 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAPPENS IF IT ALL GOES WRONG

02:19:09.507 --> 02:19:11.076 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
-- WE DON'T HAVE THAT YET BUT

02:19:11.142 --> 02:19:12.610 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
WE COULD HAVE THAT IF THIS WORK

02:19:12.677 --> 02:19:14.045 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
IS EXTENDED TO GIVE US THAT

02:19:14.112 --> 02:19:16.414 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
INFORMATION FINALLY WE THINK

02:19:16.481 --> 02:19:17.515 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THEY NEED TO PROVIDE BETTER

02:19:17.582 --> 02:19:19.350 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BACK UP PROCLAIM SURE BENEFITS

02:19:19.417 --> 02:19:21.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
URBAN AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT

02:19:21.152 --> 02:19:23.121 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THAT THE BENEFITS ARE CLEAR BUT

02:19:23.188 --> 02:19:25.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE BACKUP FOR WHAT HOW MUCH

02:19:25.323 --> 02:19:26.591 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUT IS IT WORTH WHAT WILL IT

02:19:26.658 --> 02:19:29.494 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DO WELL WE HOPE THESE CAN BE

02:19:29.561 --> 02:19:30.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ADDRESSED THESE MORE TECHNICAL

02:19:30.995 --> 02:19:32.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
POINTS CAN BE ADDRESSED IN

02:19:32.230 --> 02:19:33.698 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THE FINAL PLAN WE BELIEVE THE

02:19:33.765 --> 02:19:35.633 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
LEGISLATURE'S IMMEDIATE FOCUS

02:19:35.700 --> 02:19:36.968 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SHOULD BE ON THE FUNDING AND

02:19:37.035 --> 02:19:40.338 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
POLICY THANK YOU ENOUGH AND

02:19:40.405 --> 02:19:41.706 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THESE ARE BIG QUESTIONS BUT IF

02:19:41.773 --> 02:19:43.375 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%

POSSIBLE FOR THIS TO BE TWO

02:20:12.504 --> 02:20:13.638 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
HOURS AND FORTY MINUTES AND

02:20:13.705 --> 02:20:15.039 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THEN I THINK CLEARLY I THINK

02:20:15.106 --> 02:20:16.074 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
YOUR SUMMARY SAID ABOUT

02:20:16.141 --> 02:20:18.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THREE HOURS INTENTIONALLY --

02:20:19.043 --> 02:20:21.179 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%

SAYING WILL HAPPEN WELL I'VE

02:20:30.321 --> 02:20:31.422 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
DISCUSSED THIS ISSUE WITH

02:20:31.489 --> 02:20:32.891 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THEM THERE IS SOMETHING AND

02:20:32.957 --> 02:20:35.326 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
RAILWAY PARLANCE CALLED IT OUT

02:20:35.393 --> 02:20:36.895 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
TRAIN PERFORMANCE CALCULATORS

02:20:36.961 --> 02:20:38.496 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
COMPUTER PROGRAM THAT TAKES

02:20:38.563 --> 02:20:40.331 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

TRIP TIME FOR THE TRAIN VAT

02:20:44.536 --> 02:20:46.805 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
OF I BELIEVE IS STILL SHOWING

02:20:46.871 --> 02:20:48.540 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THE LESS THAN TWO OR AND THEN

02:20:48.606 --> 02:20:50.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FORTY MINUTES FOR A TRAIN THAT

02:20:50.141 --> 02:20:51.876 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
STARTS IN SAN FRANCISCO AND

02:20:51.943 --> 02:20:53.378 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
DOESN'T STOP UNTIL IT GETS OF

02:20:53.444 --> 02:20:56.381 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
LOS ANGELES ARE THEY WILL NEVER

02:20:56.447 --> 02:20:58.683 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
SCHEDULE THAT TRAINS NOR WILL

02:20:58.750 --> 02:21:00.151 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THE OPERATING SCHEDULE EVER

02:21:00.218 --> 02:21:02.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SHOW THAT KIND OF TRIP TIME IT

02:21:02.287 --> 02:21:04.389 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
WILL BE MORE LIKE THREE HOURS

02:21:04.455 --> 02:21:05.657 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THREE HOURS AND TEN MINUTES

02:21:05.723 --> 02:21:06.925 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WHICH THEIR BUSINESS PLANS

02:21:06.991 --> 02:21:08.927 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
HAVE SHOWN FOR SCHEDULED TRAINS

02:21:08.993 --> 02:21:10.295 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
WITH THREE STOPS THAT'S NOT

02:21:10.361 --> 02:21:12.564 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
UNREASONABLE ARE IN THE DEMAND

02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:14.032 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
FORECASTING THAT THEY'VE DONE

02:21:14.098 --> 02:21:15.567 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THIS CONSISTENT WITH THAT OUR

02:21:15.633 --> 02:21:18.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
POINT HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY THAT

02:21:18.102 --> 02:21:19.404 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THE DEMAND FORECASTING SHOULD

02:21:19.470 --> 02:21:20.905 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
BE CONSISTENT WITH THE ACTUAL

02:21:20.972 --> 02:21:23.208 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
SCHEDULE NOW WITH THE OPTIMUM

02:21:23.274 --> 02:21:26.477 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
POSSIBLE RUNTIME BUT OF THERE

02:21:26.544 --> 02:21:28.179 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THERE IS AN ISSUE OF WHAT IS A

02:21:28.246 --> 02:21:30.248 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LEGISLATION ACTUALLY REQUIRING

02:21:30.315 --> 02:21:32.050 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
IT APPEARS TECHNICALLY THAT

02:21:32.116 --> 02:21:33.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT REQUIRES THAT THE SYSTEM BE

02:21:33.685 --> 02:21:37.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DESIGNED TO YIELD ON A TRAIN

02:21:37.522 --> 02:21:38.957 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
PERFORMANCE CALCULATOR TIME

02:21:39.023 --> 02:21:40.158 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OF LESS THAN TWO HOURS AND

02:21:40.225 --> 02:21:41.593 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
FORTY MINUTES AND TECHNICALLY

02:21:41.659 --> 02:21:43.161 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THEY CAN DO THAT AND WITH THE

02:21:43.228 --> 02:21:44.195 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AIR MARKS THAT YOU'RE MAKING

02:21:44.262 --> 02:21:45.663 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
WITHOUT ME THAT IN THE BACK I

02:21:45.730 --> 02:21:47.532 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT IT'S

02:21:47.599 --> 02:21:48.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IT WOULD HAVE TO TECHNICALLY

02:21:48.967 --> 02:21:50.335 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
BE DESIGNED TO DO THAT ALTHOUGH

02:21:50.401 --> 02:21:52.804 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT MAY NEVER DO THAT WHEN THAT

02:21:52.871 --> 02:21:53.938 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
IF THEY DIDN'T MAKE IT WILL

02:21:54.005 --> 02:21:55.473 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
NEVER KNOW YOU TWO HOURS AND

02:21:55.540 --> 02:21:56.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FORTY MINUTES NOT AS IT STANDS

02:21:56.975 --> 02:21:59.510 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
NOW OBVIOUSLY OVER TIME OTHER

02:21:59.577 --> 02:22:00.712 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THINGS COULD BE DONE IF YOU

02:22:00.778 --> 02:22:02.513 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WANTED TO BUILD UP A BRAND

02:22:02.580 --> 02:22:04.983 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
NEW TRACK OF FROM FROM SAN

02:22:05.049 --> 02:22:06.684 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%

02:22:06.751 --> 02:22:08.486 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
OR TO GIVE AWAY AND SEPARATED

02:22:08.553 --> 02:22:10.054 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
COMPLETELY AND SEVEN AT YEAH

02:22:10.121 --> 02:22:12.023 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
DOT COM COULD BE DONE OKAY

02:22:12.090 --> 02:22:13.224 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
WELL THEY TECHNICALLY COULD

02:22:13.291 --> 02:22:14.392 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BE DONE IT HAS BEEN IS ARE

02:22:14.459 --> 02:22:15.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NOT I WOULDN'T ARGUE THAT THEY

02:22:15.827 --> 02:22:18.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NECESSARILY SHOULD I THINK THE

02:22:18.296 --> 02:22:20.365 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THE THAT WHAT WE ARE CIRCLING

02:22:20.431 --> 02:22:22.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IN ON MIGHT WELL BE THAT THE

02:22:22.100 --> 02:22:24.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BEST ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM

02:22:24.435 --> 02:22:25.937 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
AND THE TRIP TIME POINTS AT

02:22:26.004 --> 02:22:26.971 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
I THINK YOU HAVE THIS IN YOUR

02:22:27.038 --> 02:22:28.139 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
REPORT AND I WOULD CERTAINLY

02:22:28.206 --> 02:22:29.374 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
HEAR THIS FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS

02:22:29.440 --> 02:22:31.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IT'S ONE OF THE CRITICISMS

02:22:31.209 --> 02:22:32.710 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
ABOUT CALLING AT HIGH SPEED

02:22:32.777 --> 02:22:34.646 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%

02:22:34.712 --> 02:22:35.513 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

ON ANY GIVEN VERY CONVENIENT

02:22:38.683 --> 02:22:39.884 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AIRLINE I WON'T PITCH ONE IN

02:22:39.951 --> 02:22:42.353 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%

THINK IT DOES IN THIS BUSINESS

02:23:04.475 --> 02:23:06.277 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PLAN TRY TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT

02:23:06.344 --> 02:23:07.612 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
ARE THE OPPORTUNITY COSTS FOR

02:23:07.679 --> 02:23:08.680 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
WHERE ELSE WE CAN PUT THOSE

02:23:08.746 --> 02:23:10.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DOLLARS TO GET MOBILITY FASTER

02:23:10.682 --> 02:23:13.184 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%

HIGH SPEED RAIL HELP YOU KNOW

02:23:24.696 --> 02:23:26.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

02:23:26.331 --> 02:23:28.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BE AVOIDED BY INVESTING IN

02:23:28.132 --> 02:23:31.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THIS WAY OF I DON'T THINK --

02:23:31.269 --> 02:23:33.104 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
EXCEPT IN THE BROADER SENSE

02:23:33.171 --> 02:23:34.839 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
OF ECONOMIC BENEFITS ACOSTA

02:23:34.906 --> 02:23:36.074 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
I'M NOT SURE I'VE EVER SEEN A

02:23:36.140 --> 02:23:37.942 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
STUDY THAT SAYS WHAT THIS WOULD

02:23:38.009 --> 02:23:39.477 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WOULD DO IN THE HEALTH AREA IF

02:23:39.544 --> 02:23:40.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE DIDN'T DO IT IN THE HOUSE

02:23:40.712 --> 02:23:42.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IT REALLY WELL AND I THINK

02:23:42.880 --> 02:23:44.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LEGISLATION LAST YEAR ACTUALLY

02:23:44.148 --> 02:23:45.216 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
PROHIBITS THE ABILITY OF US

02:23:45.283 --> 02:23:47.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TO ADD MORE LANES YOU KNOW

02:23:47.218 --> 02:23:48.252 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
WHEN YOU PLACES IN ORDER TO

RELIEVE CONGESTION SO I DON'T

02:23:50.254 --> 02:23:51.289 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
KNOW THAT THROUGH EUROPE THAT

02:23:51.356 --> 02:23:52.724 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
WE'RE ABLE TO COMPARE SOMETHING

02:23:52.790 --> 02:23:54.225 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
FAIRLY IT WILL HAVE VERY HIGH

02:23:54.292 --> 02:23:55.193 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
SPEED RAIL THE SOMETHING THAT

02:23:55.259 --> 02:23:56.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE'VE NOW DECIDED IS A STATE

02:23:56.728 --> 02:23:57.528 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THAT WERE NOT REALLY GONNA BE

02:23:57.595 --> 02:23:59.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ABLE TO DO I'M NOT SURE THAT

NOT IF THEY'RE COMPARISON IT

02:24:00.665 --> 02:24:02.133 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE ANSWER

02:24:02.200 --> 02:24:04.002 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THESE QUESTIONS PRECISELY MY

02:24:04.068 --> 02:24:06.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BROTHER WHAT I'VE SAID IS THAT

02:24:06.070 --> 02:24:07.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

MORE THE PAST AND CALL IT THE

FUTURE WE JUST CAN'T DO THAT --

02:24:10.975 --> 02:24:13.711 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
WE'VE WAS THERE IT WON'T WORK

02:24:13.778 --> 02:24:15.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I THINK A HUNDRED YEARS FROM

KIND OF SUMMARIZED A LITTLE

02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:30.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

TO SAN DIEGO THINGS THAT WOULD

02:27:05.116 --> 02:27:06.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NOT INVOLVE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY

02:27:06.717 --> 02:27:08.786 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
MILES AN HOUR BUT WOULD INVOLVE

02:27:08.853 --> 02:27:10.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BETTER SERVICE ON EXISTING

02:27:10.488 --> 02:27:11.756 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
CLIENTS WHERE THERE ARE A LOT

02:27:11.822 --> 02:27:14.959 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
OF PASSENGERS ALREADY -- LIKE

02:27:15.026 --> 02:27:18.996 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
IT IT IN AND WHAT I REALLY HOPE

02:27:19.063 --> 02:27:20.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE CAN DO IS PROVOKE EXACTLY

02:27:20.698 --> 02:27:22.500 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THIS KIND OF DISCUSSION I THINK

02:27:22.567 --> 02:27:23.968 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
IT'S IMPORTANT AND THE LAST

02:27:24.035 --> 02:27:26.337 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
IS THE PRIVATE FUNDING -- OFF

02:27:26.404 --> 02:27:27.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE GET QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE'S

02:27:27.838 --> 02:27:29.207 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THE PRIVATE FUNDING THAT THAT

02:27:29.273 --> 02:27:30.608 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
AT LEAST FOLKS FEEL LIKE THEY

02:27:30.675 --> 02:27:31.842 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
HEARD ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO

02:27:31.909 --> 02:27:33.244 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
WHEN THIS WAS DEBATED AND I

02:27:33.311 --> 02:27:34.845 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
UNDERSTAND THAT'S WELL OFF INTO

02:27:34.912 --> 02:27:36.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE FUTURE WHAT DO YOU THINK

02:27:36.881 --> 02:27:38.649 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
IS THE LIKELIHOOD OF THAT BEING

02:27:38.716 --> 02:27:40.351 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
TRIGGERED AND COMING TO THE

02:27:40.418 --> 02:27:42.753 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
RESCUE THE FACT I THINK IT'S

02:27:42.820 --> 02:27:44.322 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
HIGHLY LIKELY AT SOME POINT

02:27:44.388 --> 02:27:47.391 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT THERE WILL BE SOME FORM

02:27:47.458 --> 02:27:48.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN THE

02:27:48.793 --> 02:27:50.695 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%

ME I THINK WE COULD WELL GET

TO THAT BUT THE THE POINT WE

02:28:04.642 --> 02:28:06.210 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WERE MAKING IS THAT GETTING TO

02:28:06.277 --> 02:28:07.979 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT POINT REQUIRES AN AWFUL

02:28:08.045 --> 02:28:09.647 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
LOT OF INVESTMENT THAT WE RIGHT

02:28:09.714 --> 02:28:11.582 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

ASSUMPTIONS ARE REALISTIC

02:28:36.340 --> 02:28:37.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
COULD BE MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT

02:28:37.241 --> 02:28:38.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WHICH ASSUMPTIONS HERE FOR

02:28:38.175 --> 02:28:41.279 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
INTO -- THEY THAT THE THE

OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT TO SOMEHOW

02:28:51.122 --> 02:28:52.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
MAKE THIS PROJECT WORK BUT

TO BE TAKEN IN ORDER TO COME

02:29:49.880 --> 02:29:51.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO MAKE THAT FUNDING -- MORE

SECURE THAT CONTINUUM AND OF

02:29:53.684 --> 02:29:54.819 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE WAY THAT YOU SAID IN A WAY

02:29:54.885 --> 02:29:56.354 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT YOU CAN SECURITIZED UNDER

THE CAP AND TRADE REVENUE AND

02:30:00.491 --> 02:30:02.460 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
WHAT TO EXPECT IN THE OUT YEARS

02:30:02.526 --> 02:30:03.828 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AS WAS MENTIONED THE PROGRAM

02:30:03.894 --> 02:30:05.162 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
IS ONLY CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED TO

02:30:05.229 --> 02:30:06.263 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
TWENTY THIRTY SO ONE OF THOSE

02:30:06.330 --> 02:30:08.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
KEY ACTIONS WOULD BE -- EXTANT

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:10.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IN THE PROGRAM OUT TO TWENTY

02:30:10.334 --> 02:30:14.238 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
FIFTY -- BUT EVEN THE REVENUE

02:30:14.305 --> 02:30:16.807 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
OUT TO TWENTY THIRTY -- THE

02:30:16.874 --> 02:30:18.209 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
AUTHORITY I REFERENCE SOME OF

02:30:18.275 --> 02:30:19.643 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OUR NUMBERS THAT WE PUT OUT IN

02:30:19.710 --> 02:30:21.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A RECENT REPORTS WHICH PROVIDE

02:30:21.712 --> 02:30:23.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SORT OF A LOS REVENUE SCENARIO

02:30:23.681 --> 02:30:24.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IN HIGH REVENUE SCENARIO OUT

02:30:25.015 --> 02:30:27.618 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
TO TWENTY THIRTY -- I THINK

02:30:27.685 --> 02:30:28.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
NO COUPLE IMPORTANT POINTS

02:30:28.919 --> 02:30:31.288 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ONE THOSE ARE ABSOLUTE BALANCE

02:30:31.355 --> 02:30:32.556 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ON REVENUE I MEAN IT IS EVEN

02:30:32.623 --> 02:30:33.758 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
POSSIBLE IN CERTAIN YEARS THAT

02:30:33.824 --> 02:30:35.559 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
REVENUE WOULD DROP NO BELOW

02:30:35.626 --> 02:30:37.027 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
A COUPLE BILLION DOLLARS IN

02:30:37.094 --> 02:30:38.329 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
A PARTICULAR YEAR OR IT COULD

02:30:38.396 --> 02:30:40.064 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
BE QUITE A BIT HIGHER THAN NO

02:30:40.131 --> 02:30:41.432 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SIX SEVEN EIGHT BILLION THAT

02:30:41.499 --> 02:30:43.401 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE -- -- OUTLINED THIS SORT OF

02:30:43.467 --> 02:30:45.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OUR HIGH REVENUE SCENARIO ON

02:30:45.436 --> 02:30:47.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SUCH IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND

02:30:47.271 --> 02:30:50.074 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
-- AND SO -- I CAN GET INTO

02:30:50.141 --> 02:30:51.308 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
AS MUCH DETAIL AS YOU WOULD

02:30:51.375 --> 02:30:53.177 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
LIKE ON -- ALL THE VARIOUS

02:30:53.244 --> 02:30:54.478 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
FACTORS THAT AFFECT CAP AND

02:30:54.545 --> 02:30:55.646 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
TRADE REVENUE UNCERTAINTY

02:30:55.713 --> 02:30:57.782 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
BUT AT A HIGH LEVEL NEW ARE

02:30:57.848 --> 02:30:59.984 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
A HIGH LEVEL YEAH YOU REVENUE

02:31:00.050 --> 02:31:01.552 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
DEPENDS ON ALLOWS CRISIS IN

02:31:01.619 --> 02:31:02.853 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THE NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES SOLD

02:31:02.920 --> 02:31:05.022 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
AND THOSE FACTORS DEPEND ON

02:31:05.089 --> 02:31:06.557 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THINGS LIKE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

02:31:06.624 --> 02:31:08.626 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS AS

02:31:08.692 --> 02:31:09.894 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
WELL AS A VARIETY OF REGULATORY

02:31:09.960 --> 02:31:12.430 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
DECISIONS -- THAT -- THE

02:31:12.496 --> 02:31:13.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD

02:31:13.964 --> 02:31:16.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HAS YET TO MAKE ON THINGS LIKE

02:31:16.133 --> 02:31:18.302 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
-- YOU KNOW THE PRICE CEILINGS

02:31:18.369 --> 02:31:20.304 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
SURE -- NUMBER ALLOWANCES ARE

02:31:20.371 --> 02:31:21.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GONNA BE ISSUED HOW MANY ARE

02:31:22.006 --> 02:31:23.374 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
GIVEN AWAY FOR FREE THOSE TYPES

02:31:23.441 --> 02:31:24.675 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
OF THINGS SO JUST TO GIVE YOU

02:31:24.742 --> 02:31:26.177 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A SENSE BUT LET ME CRYSTALLIZE

02:31:26.243 --> 02:31:27.478 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I GUESS MY CONCERN MY QUESTION

02:31:27.545 --> 02:31:28.813 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND I I KNOW AS AS THE CHAIR

02:31:28.879 --> 02:31:30.815 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
INDICATED NO CAP AND TRADE AS

02:31:30.881 --> 02:31:32.883 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE PROGRAM AND FULLS OF THE

02:31:32.950 --> 02:31:36.487 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
REVENUES WILL REDUCE OVERTIME

02:31:36.554 --> 02:31:37.855 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
I GUESS AS AS HE HAS AS A

02:31:37.922 --> 02:31:39.890 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
CHAIR STIPULATED SO HOW I SEE

02:31:39.957 --> 02:31:41.992 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IT IS WE HAVE AN UNCERTAIN

02:31:42.059 --> 02:31:44.094 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
FUNDING PLAN WHICH AND PAGE

02:31:44.161 --> 02:31:45.496 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
EIGHT YOU USE UNCERTAINTY A

02:31:45.563 --> 02:31:47.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
LOT AGAIN IN YOUR ANALYSIS

02:31:47.698 --> 02:31:48.833 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
AND THAT WE HAVE A VOLATILE

02:31:48.899 --> 02:31:52.069 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
SOURCE OF FUNDING TO YOU PLUG

02:31:52.136 --> 02:31:53.571 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
A LOT OF GAPS IN THIS TRAP PLAN

02:31:53.637 --> 02:31:57.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IS THAT A CORRECT ASSESSMENT

02:31:57.441 --> 02:31:58.242 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
I THINK THAT'S A FAIR

02:31:58.309 --> 02:32:00.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CHARACTERIZATION AND MY LAST

02:32:00.711 --> 02:32:02.213 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
QUESTION IN TERMS OF THE IF

02:32:02.279 --> 02:32:03.647 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THE MOST EFFECTIVE USE OF CAP

02:32:03.714 --> 02:32:05.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND TRADE DOLLARS IS I THINK

02:32:05.149 --> 02:32:06.317 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THERE'S A LOT OF DEBATE IN THIS

02:32:06.383 --> 02:32:08.519 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUILDING ABOUT THAT IS THERE

02:32:08.586 --> 02:32:10.621 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AN ANALYSIS DONE IN TERMS OF

02:32:10.688 --> 02:32:12.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF

02:32:12.289 --> 02:32:13.591 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
SHOULD WE USE CAP AND TRADE

02:32:13.657 --> 02:32:16.227 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
DOLLARS FOR THIS VERSUS OTHER

02:32:16.293 --> 02:32:18.796 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WAYS OF REDUCING WHATEVER SO

02:32:18.863 --> 02:32:21.165 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
IF WE HAVE A A DELTA OF FIFTY

02:32:21.232 --> 02:32:23.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TO SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS

02:32:23.534 --> 02:32:25.402 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
-- FOR THIS PROJECT COULD

02:32:25.469 --> 02:32:27.071 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
WE USE THAT MONEY FOR OTHER

02:32:27.137 --> 02:32:28.639 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
PURPOSES MORE EFFECTIVELY

02:32:28.706 --> 02:32:29.540 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
IS THAT HOUSE IS BEING

02:32:29.607 --> 02:32:32.576 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
DONE OR CAN'T LA I DO THAT

02:32:32.643 --> 02:32:35.145 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
I THINK IT LARGELY DEPENDS ON

02:32:35.212 --> 02:32:36.447 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES

02:32:36.514 --> 02:32:38.148 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
MENACES AND YOU KNOW -- MONEY

02:32:38.215 --> 02:32:39.316 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD

02:32:39.383 --> 02:32:40.184 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
MAKE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT

02:32:40.251 --> 02:32:41.252 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
DECISIONS ON HOW TO SPEND

02:32:41.318 --> 02:32:43.654 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
IT AND IT DEPENDS -- YES OR

02:32:43.721 --> 02:32:44.788 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
YOUR MEASURE OF EFFECTIVENESS

02:32:44.855 --> 02:32:46.090 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DEPENDS ON EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE

02:32:46.156 --> 02:32:47.458 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
TRYING TO ACHIEVE HOW THE

02:32:47.525 --> 02:32:48.993 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
ADMINISTRATION DOES PRODUCE

02:32:49.059 --> 02:32:50.094 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
A REPORT ANNUALLY WHERE THEY

02:32:50.160 --> 02:32:51.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TRY TO ESTIMATE GREENHOUSE

02:32:51.395 --> 02:32:53.264 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
GAS REDUCTIONS AND SO THERE'S

02:32:53.330 --> 02:32:54.331 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
SOME INFORMATION IN THERE

02:32:54.398 --> 02:32:55.533 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
AND THERE'S A WIDE RANGE OF

02:32:55.599 --> 02:32:57.034 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PROGRAMS AN ESTIMATED COST

02:32:57.101 --> 02:32:58.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PER TON OF EMISSION REDUCTIONS

02:32:58.469 --> 02:32:59.703 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
OF THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION

02:32:59.770 --> 02:33:01.205 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
IS AVAILABLE WE HAVE NO

02:33:01.272 --> 02:33:02.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SOME ISSUES WITH SOME OF THE

02:33:02.239 --> 02:33:03.440 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ESTIMATES BUT THERE'S A LITTLE

02:33:03.507 --> 02:33:04.275 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
BIT OF INFORMATION THERE

02:33:04.341 --> 02:33:06.110 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
BUT -- I THINK WE THINK THE

02:33:06.176 --> 02:33:07.578 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LEGISLATURE WE'VE ENCOURAGED

02:33:07.645 --> 02:33:09.446 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE LEGISLATURE TO THINK A

02:33:09.513 --> 02:33:10.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LITTLE BIT MORE BROADLY EVEN

02:33:10.581 --> 02:33:12.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THEN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION

02:33:12.116 --> 02:33:14.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
REDUCTIONS OF THE REGULATION

02:33:14.218 --> 02:33:15.352 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
ITSELF CAP AND TRADE IS

02:33:15.419 --> 02:33:16.554 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
INTENDED TO HELP THE STATE MEET

02:33:16.620 --> 02:33:18.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ITS GREENHOUSE GAS TARGETS AND

02:33:18.322 --> 02:33:19.256 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
SO WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE

02:33:19.323 --> 02:33:21.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TO THINK BROADLY ABOUT HOW

02:33:21.091 --> 02:33:22.059 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE COULD USE THIS MONEY ON A

02:33:22.126 --> 02:33:23.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
VARIETY OF THINGS WHETHER IT

02:33:23.193 --> 02:33:24.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS

02:33:24.595 --> 02:33:26.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LOCAL AIR POLLUTANT REDUCTIONS

02:33:26.330 --> 02:33:27.464 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OR THINGS EVEN OUTSIDE OF THAT

02:33:27.531 --> 02:33:28.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SCOPE THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:33:28.699 --> 02:33:29.867 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
CONSIDERED A HIGH PRIORITY SO

02:33:29.934 --> 02:33:31.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THINK ABOUT THAT WIDE RANGE OF

02:33:31.669 --> 02:33:33.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OPPORTUNITY COSTS IS IMPORTANT

02:33:33.270 --> 02:33:34.672 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
ARGUE WHAT IF THE AND GET THE

02:33:34.738 --> 02:33:36.307 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
LEO COULD GET A SYSTEM THAT I

02:33:36.373 --> 02:33:39.209 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
REALLY APPRECIATE THAT COURSE

02:33:39.276 --> 02:33:41.979 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%

PRIVATE DOLLARS IN IN SOMEBODY

02:35:02.159 --> 02:35:03.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

02:35:15.439 --> 02:35:17.775 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
GETS HER WHY ISN'T THAT ONE

02:35:17.841 --> 02:35:20.811 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
SOMETHING THAT'S BEING EXPLORED

02:35:20.878 --> 02:35:22.713 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
IT THE ANSWER THAT I THINK IS

02:35:22.780 --> 02:35:24.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT IF THEY WERE ONLY PRIVATE

02:35:24.948 --> 02:35:27.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BENEFITS AND PRIVATE COSTS

02:35:27.217 --> 02:35:28.952 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THEN WE COULD LET THE LINE TAKE

02:35:29.019 --> 02:35:31.088 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
CARE OF IT BUT THAT'S NOT THE

02:35:31.155 --> 02:35:33.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CASE THERE ARE MANIFEST PUBLIC

02:35:34.024 --> 02:35:35.859 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS

02:35:35.926 --> 02:35:37.961 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LIKE POLLUTION LIKE CONGESTION

02:35:38.028 --> 02:35:40.931 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LIKE SAFETY LIKE OF NOISE LIKE

02:35:40.998 --> 02:35:42.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS THAT THE

02:35:42.966 --> 02:35:44.435 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
PRIVATE SECTOR WILL NOT PAY

02:35:44.501 --> 02:35:46.603 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FOR AND WE CAN'T ASK THEM TO

02:35:46.670 --> 02:35:49.173 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THERE ARE ALSO PUBLIC COSTS

02:35:49.239 --> 02:35:51.608 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
-- THAT LIGHT EL OPPORTUNITY

02:35:51.675 --> 02:35:53.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BECAUSE WHERE ELSE I HATE TO

02:35:53.143 --> 02:35:54.812 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
SOUND LIKE AN ECONOMIST I SWORE

02:35:54.878 --> 02:35:56.647 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
NEVER WOULD PUT BUT I'VE GOTTEN

02:35:56.714 --> 02:35:58.382 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
INTO THIS FROM TIME TO TIME

02:35:58.449 --> 02:36:00.517 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THERE PUBLIC COSTS THAT ALSO NO

02:36:00.584 --> 02:36:02.619 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
PRIVATE ENTITY WILL TAKE INTO

02:36:02.686 --> 02:36:04.521 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
ACCOUNT ONE WHERE THE OTHER

02:36:04.588 --> 02:36:05.889 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THE QUESTION OF THESE KIND OF

02:36:05.956 --> 02:36:07.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PROJECTS AND THIS IS EXACTLY

02:36:08.025 --> 02:36:09.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHAT HAPPENS IN EUROPE IS IS

02:36:09.727 --> 02:36:11.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE SOME OF THE PUBLIC AND

02:36:11.729 --> 02:36:13.997 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
PRIVATE BENEFITS EQUAL TO THE

02:36:14.064 --> 02:36:15.632 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
SUM OF THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE

02:36:15.699 --> 02:36:17.735 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
COSTS IN THE ONLY WAY TO TURN

02:36:17.801 --> 02:36:19.203 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
MEANT TO DETERMINE THAT ONE

02:36:19.269 --> 02:36:20.871 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IS TO TRY TO PUT A NUMBER OR

02:36:20.938 --> 02:36:22.673 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
SOME VALUE ON WHAT THE PUBLIC

02:36:22.740 --> 02:36:24.241 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
BENEFITS ARE HOW MUCH IS IT

02:36:24.308 --> 02:36:26.643 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
WORTH US TO US TO ELIMINATE

02:36:26.710 --> 02:36:28.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TWENTY GRADE CROSSING DEATHS

02:36:28.312 --> 02:36:30.047 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
A YEAR BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO

02:36:30.114 --> 02:36:32.149 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
AND SAN JOSE HOW MUCH IS IT

02:36:32.216 --> 02:36:33.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
WORTH IT TO US TO M.

02:36:33.917 --> 02:36:35.586 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
TO REDUCE CONGESTION OF

02:36:35.652 --> 02:36:37.955 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
BETWEEN -- SAN JOSE AND SAN

02:36:38.021 --> 02:36:40.357 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
FRANCISCO DILLON MUST CAN'T

02:36:40.424 --> 02:36:41.759 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
GENERATE THE MONEY TO PAY FOR

02:36:41.825 --> 02:36:43.594 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THAT ONLY THE PUBLIC SECTOR

02:36:43.660 --> 02:36:45.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CAN DO THAT AND THE QUESTION

02:36:45.129 --> 02:36:46.497 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
IS IS THE COMBINATION OF

02:36:46.563 --> 02:36:48.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PUBLIC MONEY AND PRIVATE MONEY

02:36:48.599 --> 02:36:50.234 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
EQUAL TO THE BENEFITS THAT

02:36:50.300 --> 02:36:52.302 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WE BOTH TO RUNNING SENSORS

02:36:52.369 --> 02:36:53.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ARE YOU SAYING YOU DON'T SEE

02:36:53.504 --> 02:36:54.838 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THE POSSIBILITY OF A PUBLIC

02:36:54.905 --> 02:36:56.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP THAT'S

02:36:56.640 --> 02:36:58.075 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE TALKING

02:36:58.142 --> 02:36:59.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ABOUT BUT ONLY AT THE SECOND

02:36:59.943 --> 02:37:01.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PHASE OF THIS ONCE YOU'VE GONE

02:37:01.779 --> 02:37:03.213 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PAST THE POINT OF GETTING IN

02:37:03.280 --> 02:37:05.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND OUR OPERATION THEN YOU

02:37:05.883 --> 02:37:07.851 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
CAN SELL THE PRIVATE BENEFITS

02:37:07.918 --> 02:37:10.020 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR BUT THE

02:37:10.087 --> 02:37:12.389 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PUBLIC BENEFITS REMAIN IN ON

02:37:12.456 --> 02:37:16.093 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE PUBLIC SIDE AS THEY SHOULD

02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:17.961 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
LA AREAS HAVE ANYTHING READ

02:37:18.028 --> 02:37:20.330 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
RELATED OF I HEARD THEY HAVE

02:37:20.397 --> 02:37:22.065 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
YET EVEN LOOKED AT ANYTHING

02:37:22.132 --> 02:37:23.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
LIKE THAT THAT'S OUTSIDE

02:37:23.600 --> 02:37:24.368 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
THE SCOPE OF THE ANALYSIS

02:37:24.434 --> 02:37:25.769 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THAT WE'VE CONDUCTED ON THE

STRAP BUSINESS PLAN I DON'T

02:37:27.037 --> 02:37:27.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAVE A WHOLE LOT MORE TO ADD

02:37:27.971 --> 02:37:29.706 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
TO IT LOU SAID BUT I JUST

02:37:29.773 --> 02:37:30.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
UNDERSCORES THAT THE DRAFT

02:37:30.874 --> 02:37:32.843 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

IOWA'S OPERATIONAL SECURITIZED

02:37:34.778 --> 02:37:36.046 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
THOSE REVENUES AND THAT

02:37:36.113 --> 02:37:37.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WOULD INVOLVE PRIVATE SECTOR

02:37:37.080 --> 02:37:38.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
INVOLVEMENT IN A FINANCING

02:37:38.282 --> 02:37:42.152 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THE REST OF OF PHASE ONE

ALSO ACQUIRE ALL RIGHT AWAY A

02:37:57.134 --> 02:37:59.603 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
PUBLIC PRIVATE YEAH STILL GOT

ACCORDING TO WRITE I WHICH IS

02:38:02.072 --> 02:38:04.641 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
AN ONEROUS TASK AS WE CAN SEE

02:38:04.708 --> 02:38:06.844 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
-- THIS IS A QUESTION FOR THE

02:38:06.910 --> 02:38:10.614 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
JUDGE OF THIS TO THE ONLY TWO

02:38:10.681 --> 02:38:11.982 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
FOR THE ACTIONS ITEMS REQUESTED

02:38:12.049 --> 02:38:13.617 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE OF

02:38:13.684 --> 02:38:16.119 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE LEGISLATURE A TO FINANCE

02:38:16.186 --> 02:38:18.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CAP AND TRADE DOABLE AND WOULD

02:38:18.388 --> 02:38:24.161 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
REQUIRE A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE

02:38:24.228 --> 02:38:25.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I THINK WE NEED TO DISCUSS

02:38:25.295 --> 02:38:26.930 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
WITH COUNSEL IN MORE DETAIL

02:38:26.997 --> 02:38:28.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
-- TO GET A SPECIFIC ANSWER ON

02:38:28.599 --> 02:38:29.867 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHICH ITEMS WOULD REQUIRE GOOD

02:38:29.933 --> 02:38:31.235 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
PEOPLE BUT IT'S CONCEIVABLE

02:38:31.301 --> 02:38:33.270 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
THAT SOME OF THEM MIGHT A

02:38:33.337 --> 02:38:34.438 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GENERALLY SPEAKING THE ACTIONS

02:38:34.504 --> 02:38:36.540 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT YOU FORTY IS REQUESTING

02:38:36.607 --> 02:38:38.442 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
THAT SEEM TO BE WILL BE

02:38:38.508 --> 02:38:40.477 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NECESSARY TO NAY CAP AND TRADE

02:38:40.544 --> 02:38:45.349 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
REVENUES INVESTMENT GRADE

02:38:45.415 --> 02:38:47.084 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
GOOD QUESTION WOULD BE --

02:38:47.150 --> 02:38:48.285 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
DOES THEY'LL THEY'LL HAVE ANY

02:38:48.352 --> 02:38:51.054 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ADDITIONAL

02:38:51.121 --> 02:38:53.190 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
OVERSIGHT MEASURES THAT

02:38:53.257 --> 02:38:54.491 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WOULD DIE OF BE TAKEN BY THE

02:38:54.558 --> 02:38:56.360 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
LEGISLATURE OR THE MINISTRATION

02:38:56.426 --> 02:38:58.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I'LL JUST USE SP ONE AS AN

02:38:58.962 --> 02:39:01.365 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
EXAMPLE CALTRANS NOW HAS AN

02:39:01.431 --> 02:39:03.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INSPECTOR GENERAL THAT IS PART

02:39:03.233 --> 02:39:05.335 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF THAT PROCESS WATCHING FOR

02:39:05.402 --> 02:39:07.504 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT AGENCY -- WITH A SIX YEAR

02:39:07.571 --> 02:39:11.608 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
TERM DID YOU GUYS CONSIDER OF

02:39:11.675 --> 02:39:12.776 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
OTHER OVERSIGHT MEASURES THAT

02:39:12.843 --> 02:39:15.946 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THE LEGISLATURE COULD BE --

02:39:16.013 --> 02:39:18.315 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PART OF WE CAN CONSIDER THAT

02:39:18.382 --> 02:39:20.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
QUESTION BUT WE COULD WORK

02:39:20.284 --> 02:39:22.052 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
WITH YOUR STAFF TO CONSIDER

02:39:22.119 --> 02:39:23.320 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
AT ANSWERING THAT PERHAPS

02:39:23.387 --> 02:39:25.222 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
IN IN MORE DETAIL -- IT'S

02:39:25.289 --> 02:39:26.290 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
WORTH NOTING OF COURSE THAT

02:39:26.356 --> 02:39:27.524 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
-- JOINT AUDIT COMMITTEE IS

02:39:27.591 --> 02:39:29.293 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ALSO WANTS NOT OF OF THE HAS

YOUR AUTHORITY IN THE PROJECT

02:39:30.560 --> 02:39:32.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND THAT'S A POSITIVE STEP

02:39:33.030 --> 02:39:34.364 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT --

02:39:34.431 --> 02:39:37.334 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
THAT ARTICLE BEGUN IN THE

02:39:37.401 --> 02:39:39.736 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
LATTER PART OF MAY I THINK

02:39:39.803 --> 02:39:41.238 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IT'S A SEVERAL MONTH PROCESS

02:39:41.305 --> 02:39:42.139 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BUT I NEED TO DOUBLE CHECK

02:39:42.205 --> 02:39:44.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THAT TO GIVE YOU CORRECT

THE DRAFT PLAN CONTAINS

02:40:17.641 --> 02:40:18.308 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
RECOMMENDATIONS OF NEEDED

02:40:18.375 --> 02:40:20.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ACTIONS FOR LEGISLATION TO TAKE.

02:40:20.177 --> 02:40:21.144 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
TO ENABLE THE AUTHORITY TO FIND

HIS CAP AND TRADE FUNDS.

02:40:22.179 --> 02:40:23.447 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WITH THESE ACTIONS BE SUFFICIENT

02:40:23.513 --> 02:40:24.614 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
TO BUILD THE SYSTEM. IN IS THIS

02:40:24.681 --> 02:40:26.049 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THE BEST OPTION FOR FUNDING THE

02:40:26.116 --> 02:40:30.454 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
IOS.

02:40:30.520 --> 02:40:32.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WELL FIRST OF SHIP THANK YOU FOR

SO MUCH FOR THAT QUESTION TO ME.

02:40:39.930 --> 02:40:41.732 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
COULD STILL PUT YOU ON THE SPOT

02:40:41.798 --> 02:40:41.932 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:13%
THEM.

02:40:41.999 --> 02:40:44.301 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:38%
I AND. I THINK.

02:40:44.368 --> 02:40:45.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE ANSWER IS NO IT WON'T BE

02:40:45.435 --> 02:40:46.536 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
SUFFICIENT TO FINISH THIS

02:40:46.603 --> 02:40:47.371 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THERE IS MORE THAT WILL HAVE TO

02:40:47.437 --> 02:40:48.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BE DONE ESPECIALLY IF YOU REALLY

02:40:48.405 --> 02:40:50.340 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WANT TO REDEDICATE TO DOING FACE

02:40:50.407 --> 02:40:52.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
ONE AND FINISHING.

02:40:52.209 --> 02:40:55.345 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THAT ONLY IF YOU WERE TO SAY.

02:40:55.412 --> 02:40:57.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ALL OF THE CAP AND TRADE MONEY

02:40:57.080 --> 02:40:59.316 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GOES TO HIGH SPEED RAIL AND.

02:40:59.383 --> 02:41:01.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
ONLY IF THE HIGHER END

02:41:01.251 --> 02:41:03.787 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
ESTIMATES WERE TO COME ABOUT.

02:41:03.854 --> 02:41:05.155 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
WHERE THAT WOULD THAT BE ENOUGH

02:41:05.222 --> 02:41:07.491 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:28%
TO SUFFICE?

02:41:07.557 --> 02:41:09.126 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OTHERWISE IT'S OTHER SOURCES ARE

02:41:09.192 --> 02:41:10.994 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
GOING TO HAVE TO BE FOUND NOT

02:41:11.061 --> 02:41:13.530 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
WRITTEN NOT NECESSARILY AFTER

02:41:13.597 --> 02:41:16.066 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
IT'S AN OPERATION BUT TO GET IT

02:41:16.133 --> 02:41:16.600 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
TO THE POINT WHERE IT CAN

02:41:16.666 --> 02:41:20.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
OPERATE.

02:41:20.070 --> 02:41:22.305 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WELL BASED ON THE DOES THE CURVE

02:41:22.372 --> 02:41:23.540 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
YOU GROUP BELIEVE THE FINANCING

02:41:23.607 --> 02:41:30.414 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
PLAN THAT WAS IS VIABLE.

02:41:30.480 --> 02:41:32.649 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MARTIN DARLING I THINK MORE WILL

02:41:32.716 --> 02:41:34.518 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NEED TO BE DONE OVER A PERIOD OF

02:41:34.584 --> 02:41:36.553 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TIME TO GET US THERE. ESPECIALLY

02:41:36.620 --> 02:41:39.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IF AS WE SAID YOU HAVE TO PLAN

02:41:39.322 --> 02:41:40.290 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
FOR THE HIGH END OF THE

02:41:40.357 --> 02:41:42.692 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
ESTIMATES TO COME TRUE RATHER

02:41:42.759 --> 02:41:44.461 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THAN THE THE MIDDLE OR THE OR

02:41:44.528 --> 02:41:46.163 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THE MORE FAVORABLE NUMBERS.

02:41:46.229 --> 02:41:47.464 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
IT WILL BE THERE WILL BE MORE

02:41:47.531 --> 02:41:49.499 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THAT WILL NEED TO BE DONE AND

02:41:49.566 --> 02:41:52.269 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
AND AND I I THINK. AGAIN IF

02:41:52.335 --> 02:41:54.271 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
YOU'RE GOING TO GO FORWARD WITH

02:41:54.337 --> 02:41:56.706 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
PHASE ONE TYPE AMBITION.

02:41:56.773 --> 02:41:59.142 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
WE REALLY NEED THE PLAN FOR THE

02:41:59.209 --> 02:42:01.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
UPPER END OF THE RANGE NOT NOT

02:42:01.611 --> 02:42:03.246 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE MID PART OF THAT I'D LOVE TO

02:42:03.313 --> 02:42:04.247 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
HAVE IT TURN OUT BETTER BUT BUT

02:42:04.314 --> 02:42:06.283 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
I WOULD.

02:42:06.349 --> 02:42:07.551 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
ABSENT SAID I'M AN OPTIMIST AND

02:42:07.617 --> 02:42:09.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MY HOPES BUT I'M A REALIST IN MY

02:42:09.653 --> 02:42:12.022 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
PLANTS AND IN THIS CASE I THINK

02:42:12.089 --> 02:42:13.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
REALISM WOULD SAY.

02:42:13.223 --> 02:42:16.159 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:23%
PLAN FOR.

02:42:16.226 --> 02:42:17.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COMPLETING IT IN UNDER ADVERSE

02:42:17.794 --> 02:42:19.629 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
OUTCOME.

02:42:19.696 --> 02:42:22.265 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
KRISTIN.

02:42:22.332 --> 02:42:23.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO DO YOU THINK THAT THE EARLY

02:42:23.900 --> 02:42:25.135 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
SERVICE ON THE CENTRAL VALLEY

02:42:25.202 --> 02:42:26.470 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LINE OR THE SAN FRANCISCO TO

02:42:26.536 --> 02:42:28.271 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
GILROY LINE MIGHT VIOLATE

02:42:28.338 --> 02:42:29.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
PROPOSITION ONE A.

02:42:29.739 --> 02:42:34.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THERE IS NO SUBSIDY MANDATE.

02:42:34.311 --> 02:42:35.579 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
WELL I THINK THAT THAT THAT'S A

02:42:35.645 --> 02:42:36.947 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
GOOD QUESTION IT ISN'T CLEAR TO

02:42:37.013 --> 02:42:38.748 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ME WHAT THE EARLY SERVICE OF

02:42:38.815 --> 02:42:41.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HIGH SPEED RAIL FROM SAN JOSE TO

02:42:41.251 --> 02:42:42.652 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
SAN FRANCISCO OR GILROY MIGHT

02:42:42.719 --> 02:42:44.454 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
ENTAIL I DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT

02:42:44.521 --> 02:42:45.956 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THEY REALLY WOULD DO THAT.

02:42:46.022 --> 02:42:47.624 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
AND I CERTAINLY THINK THE

02:42:47.691 --> 02:42:49.259 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
CONTRIBUTION OF THIS MONEY TO A

02:42:49.326 --> 02:42:50.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CALTRANS PERFORMANCE WILL BE

02:42:50.894 --> 02:42:52.462 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
POSITIVE AND WE DON'T NEED TO

02:42:52.529 --> 02:42:54.364 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:43%
WORRY ABOUT THAT.

02:42:54.431 --> 02:42:55.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAT WOULD THIS HURT THE SERVICE

02:42:55.665 --> 02:42:57.934 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
WOULD LOOK LIKE BETWEEN A AND

02:42:58.001 --> 02:43:00.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE CENTRAL VALLEY AGAIN OTHER

02:43:00.203 --> 02:43:01.838 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAN TESTING I DON'T KNOW THAT

02:43:01.905 --> 02:43:03.340 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
HIGH SPEED RAIL?

02:43:03.406 --> 02:43:04.574 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY

02:43:04.641 --> 02:43:05.308 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:23%
WOULD DO.

02:43:05.375 --> 02:43:07.110 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:03%
.

02:43:07.177 --> 02:43:08.945 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
I THINK THE INITIAL SERVICE

02:43:09.012 --> 02:43:11.548 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WOULD BE TO ALLOW. AMTRAK TO USE

02:43:11.615 --> 02:43:13.617 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
HIGH SPEED RAIL TRACKS.

02:43:13.683 --> 02:43:15.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HOWARD ST SAN JOAQUIN SWITCH

02:43:15.418 --> 02:43:16.753 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%

02:43:22.392 --> 02:43:24.528 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%

02:43:24.594 --> 02:43:26.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AT THE OUTSET I REALLY DON'T

02:43:26.296 --> 02:43:28.498 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
KNOW AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S

02:43:28.565 --> 02:43:30.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BEEN WELL ENOUGH. DEFINED.

02:43:30.467 --> 02:43:33.336 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
SO.

02:43:33.403 --> 02:43:34.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LA THOUGH IN AND MISTER THOMPSON

02:43:34.804 --> 02:43:37.207 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WOULD YOU EVER HAVE YOU EVER

02:43:37.274 --> 02:43:38.842 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THOUGHT ABOUT IF THERE WAS.

02:43:38.909 --> 02:43:40.777 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE POSSIBILITY OF A REVENUE

02:43:40.844 --> 02:43:41.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GENERATING COMPONENT OF HIGH

02:43:42.012 --> 02:43:44.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
SPEED FREIGHT.

02:43:44.080 --> 02:43:44.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO

02:43:45.015 --> 02:43:46.249 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
TO.

02:43:46.316 --> 02:43:47.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
ALL WHO MET.

02:43:47.884 --> 02:43:49.653 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE SYSTEM IN SOME KIND OF

02:43:49.719 --> 02:43:52.656 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
FUTURISTIC KIND OF CONCEPT.

02:43:52.722 --> 02:43:55.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WERE OF SOME OF THE FOREIGN.

02:43:55.158 --> 02:43:57.460 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
COMPANIES THAT PERFORM.

02:43:57.527 --> 02:43:59.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
I SPEED RAIL

02:43:59.129 --> 02:44:01.798 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
I HAVE THAT THAT DYNAMIC.

02:44:01.865 --> 02:44:03.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AN YOU WHEN YOU LOOK ABOUT THE

02:44:06.670 --> 02:44:08.238 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
BICU MOBILITY THROUGHPUT

02:44:08.305 --> 02:44:09.105 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
BASED ON THIS.

02:44:09.172 --> 02:44:10.941 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
WOULD IT BE.

02:44:11.007 --> 02:44:13.143 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
ANOTHER OPTION IN YOUR VIEW

02:44:13.210 --> 02:44:15.345 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
POINT AS A VIABLE.

02:44:15.412 --> 02:44:17.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOURCE OF INCOME THAT MIGHT BE

02:44:17.881 --> 02:44:19.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
INTEGRATED NO.

02:44:19.983 --> 02:44:21.518 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
AND I REALLY DON'T THINK SO I

02:44:21.585 --> 02:44:22.752 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THINK THE EXPERIENCE WITH HIGH

02:44:22.819 --> 02:44:23.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
SPEED.

02:44:24.054 --> 02:44:25.422 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PASSENGER TRAINS OR A VERY

02:44:25.488 --> 02:44:27.257 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
SPECIAL BEAST.

02:44:27.324 --> 02:44:28.925 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT MARKET

02:44:28.992 --> 02:44:30.427 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND A DIFFERENT SET OF CUSTOMERS

02:44:30.493 --> 02:44:31.328 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
IN A DIFFERENT SET OF TECHNICAL

02:44:31.394 --> 02:44:33.463 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:33%
REQUIREMENTS.

02:44:33.530 --> 02:44:35.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EVERY TIME PASSENGER RAILROADS

02:44:36.066 --> 02:44:37.934 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
HAVE TRIED TO OPERATE FREIGHT

02:44:38.001 --> 02:44:39.269 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
SERVICES THEY'VE HAD TROUBLE.

02:44:39.336 --> 02:44:41.371 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
NOW HIGH PRIORITY PACKAGE

02:44:41.438 --> 02:44:43.073 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
SERVICE FEDERAL EXPRESS KIND OF

02:44:43.139 --> 02:44:44.608 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
STUFF YES BUT THAT THAT'S A

02:44:44.674 --> 02:44:46.743 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
POSSIBILITY.

02:44:46.810 --> 02:44:48.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT ANY ANYTHING BEYOND THAT I

02:44:48.845 --> 02:44:52.182 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
WOULD BE SUSPICIOUS OF THE.

02:44:52.249 --> 02:44:52.749 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
MOUSSA BUT I APPRECIATE THE

GANDER.

02:44:53.650 --> 02:44:55.452 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
SO LAST QUESTION FOR ME OF.

02:44:55.518 --> 02:44:57.187 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
WISCONSIN.

02:44:57.254 --> 02:44:58.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH WHAT

02:44:58.855 --> 02:44:59.656 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WOULD HAPPEN IF THIS PROJECT

02:44:59.723 --> 02:45:02.459 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
STOPPED.

02:45:02.525 --> 02:45:03.827 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
WELL THAT WOULD DEPEND ON HOW

02:45:03.893 --> 02:45:05.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHAT STOPPED IF YOU STOPPED IT

FEDERAL MONEY BATS.

02:45:15.872 --> 02:45:18.308 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
APPARENTLY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.

02:45:18.375 --> 02:45:20.243 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IF INSTEAD YOU SAID COMPLETE

PAY BACK THE FEDERAL MONEY

02:45:48.638 --> 02:45:49.139 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

WE'RE BATTLING AND THEN. THAT

02:45:54.344 --> 02:45:58.715 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WOULD BE IT AS I UNDERSTAND.

02:45:58.782 --> 02:46:01.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND NOT ONLY THAT VALUE LOST BUT

02:46:01.184 --> 02:46:02.986 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ALSO ALL OF THE JOBS THAT HAVE

02:46:03.053 --> 02:46:04.154 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:38%

PEOPLE HAVE COMMITTED RESOURCES

02:46:05.855 --> 02:46:08.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
IT WOULD BE.

02:46:08.725 --> 02:46:12.329 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:58%
IN THAT REGION. JUST AN
ABSOLUTE.

02:46:12.395 --> 02:46:14.631 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
ECONOMIC DEVASTATION THAT

AND THE IMPACT ON. THE ECONOMY.

02:46:19.336 --> 02:46:23.139 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:23%
WOULD BE.

02:46:23.206 --> 02:46:24.674 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THAT PART THAT'S DEPENDENT ON

03:04:37.833 --> 03:04:39.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I'M SURE THE GRADE SEPARATIONS

03:04:39.768 --> 03:04:40.803 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
ARE GOING TO BE.

03:04:40.869 --> 03:04:43.105 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
MENTION AND LOOKED AT AS PART

03:04:43.172 --> 03:04:43.372 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
OF THAT.

.

03:04:45.541 --> 03:04:47.075 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
YOU TO BE REALLY HONEST WE

03:04:53.916 --> 03:04:56.084 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
SYSTEM CALTRAIN IS NOT.

03:04:56.151 --> 03:04:57.453 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
THEIR ORGANIZATION THAT

03:04:57.519 --> 03:04:59.621 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
RECEIVES A DEDICATED SOURCE OF

03:04:59.688 --> 03:05:01.156 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:43%
TAX FUNDS WE ARE.

03:05:01.223 --> 03:05:04.326 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
FUNDED OVER SEVENTY PERCENT FOR

OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE

03:05:05.761 --> 03:05:08.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SIMPLY BAR FOR A BOX OF REVENUE.

03:05:08.330 --> 03:05:09.865 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
IN UNDER THE BALANCE COMES FROM

03:05:09.932 --> 03:05:12.134 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
OUR OR THREE COUNTY PARTNERS.

03:05:12.201 --> 03:05:15.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND WE HAVE NEVER HISTORICALLY

03:05:15.270 --> 03:05:17.406 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
HAD A GREAT SEPARATION PROGRAM.

03:05:17.473 --> 03:05:20.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
END SO WE RECOGNIZE IT IS IT'S

03:05:20.742 --> 03:05:22.411 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NOT JUST A HIGH SPEED RAIL ISSUE

03:05:22.478 --> 03:05:24.146 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
IT'S A CALTRAIN ISSUE IT'S AN

03:05:24.213 --> 03:05:25.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ISSUE FOR THE COMMUNITIES.

SAM UNTIL COUNTY.

ITSELF FROM LOCAL FUND'S

03:05:29.384 --> 03:05:32.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LEVERAGING OF OTHER FUNDS HAS.

03:05:32.087 --> 03:05:33.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
FUNDED A NUMBER OF GREAT

03:05:33.322 --> 03:05:34.623 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:28%
SEPARATIONS

03:05:34.690 --> 03:05:36.959 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
WE HAVE ONE GOING ON NOW THAT'S

03:05:37.025 --> 03:05:38.293 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
LIKE JOINTLY FUNDED WITH HIGH

03:05:38.360 --> 03:05:40.662 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:68%
SPEED RAIL IN THE SAN MATEO
AREA.

03:05:40.729 --> 03:05:42.297 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT

03:05:42.364 --> 03:05:43.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE HIGH SPEED RAIL FUNDS.

03:05:43.866 --> 03:05:46.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND SANTA CLARA COUNTY WHEN IT

03:05:46.535 --> 03:05:47.836 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
PASSED ITS THAT MEASURE BE.

03:05:47.903 --> 03:05:50.205 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEENA

03:05:50.272 --> 03:05:51.507 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONEY.

03:05:51.573 --> 03:05:52.574 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
AVAILABLE TOWARDS GRADE

03:05:52.641 --> 03:05:54.243 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
SEPARATIONS.

03:05:54.309 --> 03:05:55.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS

03:05:55.711 --> 03:05:57.045 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
JUST WE NEED TO STEP BACK AND

03:05:57.112 --> 03:05:58.780 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%

GREATER BAY AREA FROM THE WORK

03:08:07.109 --> 03:08:07.576 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

POSSIBLE.

03:08:42.778 --> 03:08:44.680 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
BUT FOR THE FUNDING.

03:08:44.746 --> 03:08:46.815 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:43%
WELL BOB I GUESS.

03:08:46.882 --> 03:08:48.150 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE BEST WAY I COULD ANSWER THAT

03:08:48.216 --> 03:08:48.884 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:38%
IS TO SAY THAT.

03:08:48.950 --> 03:08:51.019 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:03%
.

03:08:51.086 --> 03:08:53.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IN THE CALTRAIN TO STRATEGIC

03:08:53.522 --> 03:08:54.690 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%

EIGHT THE VOTERS WERE TOLD.

03:12:34.075 --> 03:12:35.911 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FOR TEN BILLION DOLLARS THEY

03:12:37.712 --> 03:12:40.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BILLION DOLLAR. HIGH SPEED RAIL.

THAT THE FUN THE ACTUAL NUMBER.

03:12:47.389 --> 03:12:48.757 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

BILLION. AND THEN EXTRAPOLATE
