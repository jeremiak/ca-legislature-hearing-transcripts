00:34:24.896 --> 00:34:26.931
JANUARY TWENTY FIFTEEN REPORT TO

VIEW ON A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT

00:34:36.741 --> 00:34:39.844
NEEDED TO BE DONE TO IMPROVE THE

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:43.714
IN CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY

00:34:43.781 --> 00:34:46.317
AROUND CHILD WELFARE OF COURSE --

00:34:46.384 --> 00:34:48.653
THE THERE WERE A VARIETY OF OF

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:50.822
GOALS OF THE OF THAT WITHIN THAT

00:34:50.888 --> 00:34:52.356
BUT PRIMARILY AROUND THE

00:34:52.423 --> 00:34:54.592
REDUCING THE USE OF CONGREGATE

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:56.794
CARE -- WE WE FOUND THAT WHILE

00:34:56.861 --> 00:34:57.662
OF COURSE THERE ARE GOOD

00:34:57.728 --> 00:34:58.996
CONGREGATE CARE PROVIDERS TO

PRODUCE GOOD OUTCOMES BY AND

00:35:00.898 --> 00:35:02.433
LARGE THE ASSOCIATIONS THAT A

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:05.670
DEMOGRAPHIC LEVEL -- ARE BETTER

00:35:05.736 --> 00:35:06.838
FOR USE WHEN THEY ARE IN HOME

00:35:06.904 --> 00:35:08.873
BASED FAMILY CARE SITUATIONS

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:14.045
WITH IT WITH A A MORE LIMITED --

00:35:14.111 --> 00:35:14.946
GROUP GROUP AROUND THEM -- THAT

00:35:15.012 --> 00:35:16.080
THEY CAN BE CARED FOR YOU

00:35:16.147 --> 00:35:17.315
OBVIOUSLY CAN'T JUST TAKE KIDS

00:35:17.381 --> 00:35:19.150
OUT OF A GROUP HOME YOU HAVE TO

00:35:19.217 --> 00:35:20.551
HAVE SOME PLACE TO PUT THEM.

00:35:20.618 --> 00:35:22.587
SO THAT WAS THE REFLECTION IN

00:35:22.653 --> 00:35:24.121
THE INITIAL INVESTMENTS MADE IN

00:35:24.188 --> 00:35:27.091

FACILITY TYPES THAT WE HAVE.

00:35:35.733 --> 00:35:37.435
A MAKING SETTING THE EXPECTATION

00:35:37.502 --> 00:35:39.036
THAT GROUP HOMES WOULD BE PHASED

00:35:39.103 --> 00:35:40.505
OUT IN THE CHILD WELFARE ARENA

00:35:40.571 --> 00:35:41.572
IN FAVOR OF SHORT TERM

00:35:41.639 --> 00:35:44.475
RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMS --

00:35:44.542 --> 00:35:45.843
I DON'T WANT TO USE THE WORD

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:47.578
CRISIS STABILIZATION BUT THEY

00:35:47.645 --> 00:35:48.779
WERE ENVISIONED AS SIX MONTHS

00:35:48.846 --> 00:35:50.515
MAXIMUM PLACEMENTS AND LAST

00:35:50.581 --> 00:35:51.716
THOSE STRENGTHS AND NEEDS OF THE

00:35:51.782 --> 00:35:53.885
CHILD AND YOUTH INDICATED A

00:35:53.951 --> 00:35:55.253
LONGER PERIOD OF TIME WAS NEEDED.

00:35:55.319 --> 00:35:56.854
AND THAT REALLY THE FOCUS OF OUR

00:35:56.921 --> 00:35:59.490
EFFORT WAS TO GET HOME BASE

00:35:59.557 --> 00:36:03.094
FAMILY KERR -- WE HAVE GONE TO

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:05.162
SINCE JANUARY TWENTY FIFTEEN

00:36:05.229 --> 00:36:06.564
THROUGH SEVERAL YEARS OF POLICY

00:36:06.631 --> 00:36:08.833
DEVELOPMENT AND GUIDANCE A LOT

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:10.935
OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE -- WITH

00:36:11.002 --> 00:36:12.703
COUNTIES WITH PROVIDERS IN THE

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:14.772
SYSTEM AND WE'VE BEEN MOVE NOW

00:36:14.839 --> 00:36:16.307
BEYOND THE JUST THE POLICY

00:36:16.374 --> 00:36:17.909
DEVELOPMENT AND INTO THE

00:36:17.975 --> 00:36:19.911
IMPLEMENTATION PHASE AND MORE

00:36:19.977 --> 00:36:21.245
NOW A COUPLE YEARS INTO THAT.

00:36:21.312 --> 00:36:22.914
AND YOU'LL SEE THAT REFLECTED IN

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:26.017
THE IN THE FUNDING -- THAT THAT --

00:36:26.083 --> 00:36:29.220
IS IS PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET AND

00:36:29.287 --> 00:36:30.655
HAS BEEN PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET --

00:36:30.721 --> 00:36:32.823
IN ADDITION TO EFFORTS TO A

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:35.293
RETAIN AND RECRUIT FAMILIES AND

00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:37.295
TO CHANGE THE THE MIX OF

00:36:37.361 --> 00:36:38.763
PROVIDER TYPES AND OUR SERVICE

00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:41.098
EXPECTATIONS OF THOSE PROVIDERS.

00:36:41.165 --> 00:36:42.533
A CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMING

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.635
CONCEPTS WERE A MAJOR FEATURE OF

00:36:44.702 --> 00:36:46.070
THIS IT'S IMPORTANT.

00:36:46.137 --> 00:36:47.171
I THINK IT'S NO SECRET TO

00:36:47.238 --> 00:36:48.606
ANYBODY THAT WHEN PEOPLE

00:36:48.673 --> 00:36:49.907
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING TO

00:36:49.974 --> 00:36:50.908
THEM AND THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'VE

00:36:50.975 --> 00:36:52.977
HAD A VOICE AND BEEN ABLE TO BE

00:36:53.044 --> 00:36:53.778
HEARD THEY HAVE MORE BY INTO

00:36:53.844 --> 00:36:55.313
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THEM.

00:36:55.379 --> 00:36:56.948
AND SO CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMING

00:36:57.014 --> 00:36:59.450
AROUND DECISIONS ABOUT PLACEMENT

00:36:59.517 --> 00:37:03.521
ABOUT SERVICE NEEDS -- ABOUT

00:37:03.588 --> 00:37:04.422
DURATION OF CARING OVERALL CASE

00:37:04.488 --> 00:37:05.523
MANAGEMENT AND WHAT'S IN A COURT

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:07.725
REPORT THOSE ARE ALL FEATURES OF

00:37:07.792 --> 00:37:11.395
CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMING.

00:37:11.462 --> 00:37:14.498
EXCUSE ME SACRAMENTO ALLERGIES --

00:37:14.565 --> 00:37:16.434
THE OTHER MAJOR FEATURE -- WELL

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:17.702
IT WAS A DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW

00:37:17.768 --> 00:37:20.137
RATE SYSTEM FOR ABOUT TWENTY

00:37:20.204 --> 00:37:21.606
YEARS PRIOR TO THIS -- WE'VE HAD

00:37:21.672 --> 00:37:23.441
AN AGE BASED SYSTEM WHERE AS A

00:37:23.507 --> 00:37:25.176
CHILD GOT OLDER RATE RATES

00:37:25.242 --> 00:37:28.179
CHANGED -- WE'VE DOW IMPLEMENTED

00:37:28.245 --> 00:37:29.413
A RATE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:31.682
THAT'S BASED ON THE SS STRENGTHS

00:37:31.749 --> 00:37:33.017
AND NEEDS OF THE CHILD.

00:37:33.084 --> 00:37:34.986
AND INTENDED TO BETTER SUPPORT

00:37:35.052 --> 00:37:37.021
FAMILIES -- ROUGHLY A HUNDRED

00:37:37.088 --> 00:37:38.255

GIVEN TO FAMILIES.

00:37:41.492 --> 00:37:44.261
A CHANGE IN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

00:37:44.328 --> 00:37:45.630
THAT WE PROVIDE FOR SERVICES AND

00:37:45.696 --> 00:37:47.865

TEAMS THE THE SUPPORT FOR FOSTER

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.888
PARENT CARE GIVERS AND RESOURCE

00:39:17.955 --> 00:39:19.623
FAMILY APPROVAL WHAT WE USED TO

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:21.559
CALL A FOSTER FAMILY HOME IS NOW

00:39:21.625 --> 00:39:24.595
KNOWN AS A RESOURCE -- FAMILY --

00:39:24.662 --> 00:39:25.863
SO THAT'S A TERMINOLOGY CHANGE

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:27.198
BUT THE CONCEPT IS THE SAME

00:39:27.264 --> 00:39:28.899
THOSE ARE THAT THE HOME BASED

00:39:28.966 --> 00:39:31.335
FAMILY KERR -- PROVIDERS CARE

00:39:31.402 --> 00:39:31.902
GIVERS THAT WE WERE TALKING

00:39:31.969 --> 00:39:33.404
ABOUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

00:39:33.471 --> 00:39:34.839
OTHER THINGS THAT ARE DISCUSSED

00:39:34.905 --> 00:39:37.441
IN YOUR AGENDA -- THERE'S BEEN A

00:39:37.508 --> 00:39:38.876
LOT OF CHANGE MANAGEMENT THAT'S

00:39:38.943 --> 00:39:40.711
BEEN DIFFICULT UNDERSTANDING

00:39:40.778 --> 00:39:42.713
ROLES AND EXPECTATIONS THE THE

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:45.182
TRANSFER OF OF FAMILIES FROM A

00:39:45.249 --> 00:39:47.585
FOSTER FAMILY DESIGNATION TO A

00:39:47.651 --> 00:39:49.086
RESOURCE FAMILY DESIGNATION.

00:39:49.153 --> 00:39:50.988
HAS BEEN SLOWER N

00:39:51.055 --> 00:39:53.023
EVERYBODY ANTICIPATED -- THERE'S

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:54.258
BEEN SOME INVESTMENTS AND BY THE

00:39:54.325 --> 00:39:55.926
LEGISLATURE AND AND THE LAST

00:39:55.993 --> 00:39:57.394
ADMINISTRATION IN THE CURRENT

00:39:57.461 --> 00:39:58.829
BUDGET TO GET -- THROUGH A

00:39:58.896 --> 00:40:00.831
BACKLOG TO APPROVE THOSE MORE

00:40:00.898 --> 00:40:03.868
TIMELY -- BUT THERE WAS A

00:40:03.934 --> 00:40:05.870
FUNDING AUGMENTATION MADE A

00:40:05.936 --> 00:40:08.672
COUPLE YEARS NOW -- THAT WE USED

00:40:08.739 --> 00:40:11.408
TO PAY -- FAMILY CARE GIVER WHEN

00:40:11.475 --> 00:40:13.310
THE CHILD I AM SORRY WHEN THEY

00:40:13.377 --> 00:40:15.513
HOME WAS APPROVED AS A PLACEMENT.

00:40:15.579 --> 00:40:17.515
BUT VERY OFTEN WE FIND PLACEMENT

00:40:17.581 --> 00:40:19.784
PRIOR TO APPROVAL AND SO THERE

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:20.785
WAS A PERIOD OF TIME WHERE

00:40:20.851 --> 00:40:22.386
FAMILIES DIDN'T HAVE FINANCIAL

00:40:22.453 --> 00:40:23.854
SUPPORT THAT MAYBE WOULD HAVE

00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:24.822
HELPED THEM.

00:40:24.889 --> 00:40:26.223
EITHER BE A BETTER CARE GIVER OR

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:27.825
BE WILLING TO ACCEPT A CHILD IN

00:40:27.892 --> 00:40:28.893
THE FIRST PLACE SO THAT'S A

00:40:28.959 --> 00:40:31.028
MAJOR INVESTMENT THE LEVEL OF

00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:32.496
CARE PROTOCOL TOOL HELPS US TO

00:40:32.563 --> 00:40:34.331
SIGN THE NEEDS BASE RATE TO A

00:40:34.398 --> 00:40:35.266
CHILD.

00:40:35.332 --> 00:40:36.700
CANS THE CHILD ASSESSMENT OF

00:40:36.767 --> 00:40:38.335
NEEDS AND STRENGTHS IS THE

00:40:38.402 --> 00:40:39.503
FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT WE'RE

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:41.338

00:40:41.405 --> 00:40:42.907
STRENGTHS OF THE YOUTH.

00:40:42.973 --> 00:40:43.707
AND THEN THERE ARE THE OTHER

00:40:43.774 --> 00:40:45.643
BUCKET WHICH I WON'T DESCRIBE

00:40:45.709 --> 00:40:50.648

GOVERNMENT THAT I THINK WILL BE --

00:43:23.634 --> 00:43:24.868
THAT WILL BE FOUNDATIONAL TO

00:43:24.935 --> 00:43:27.004

I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE A A

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:48.092
COUPLE OF AREAS THAT WE I THINK

00:43:48.158 --> 00:43:49.660

00:59:20.556 --> 00:59:22.191
SCREENING IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT

00:59:22.258 --> 00:59:23.459
NOT TO HAVE THE MENTAL HEALTH

00:59:23.526 --> 00:59:25.061
CONVERSATION HERE BECAUSE THE

00:59:25.128 --> 00:59:26.129

AT SOME LENGTH ALL YEAR BUT THIS

00:59:31.267 --> 00:59:32.135
QUESTION OF WHAT IS MEDICAL

00:59:32.201 --> 00:59:33.169
NECESSITY.

TRAUMA OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT AND

00:59:40.677 --> 00:59:42.378
A REMOVAL -- I THINK IT'S A

00:59:42.445 --> 00:59:43.446
SIGNIFICANT ONE FOR THE

00:59:43.513 --> 00:59:44.781
LEGISLATURE BECAUSE IT SEEMS

00:59:44.847 --> 00:59:46.849
COUNTERINTUITIVE AN INCONSISTENT

00:59:46.916 --> 00:59:48.685

FOSTER CARE OF EXPERIENCED.

00:59:50.286 --> 00:59:51.955
THAT THINK THAT SEVEN OUT OF TEN

00:59:52.021 --> 00:59:53.356

DEFINITION OF MEDICAL NECESSITY.

01:00:07.136 --> 01:00:08.738
IS THAT SOMETHING THEM I HOPE WE

01:00:08.805 --> 01:00:11.207

WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THE ISSUES

01:06:23.446 --> 01:06:24.747
THAT THEY'RE SEEING SPECIFICALLY

01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:27.283
COUNTY BY COUNTY ON THE GROUND

01:06:27.350 --> 01:06:29.285
WE'RE ALSO PRIORITIZING OUR

01:06:29.352 --> 01:06:32.421

A LARGE AMOUNT IS ARE OBVIOUSLY

01:06:49.105 --> 01:06:49.905
MORE OFTEN BECAUSE THEY HAVE

01:06:49.972 --> 01:06:51.741
MORE CASES TO WORK THROUGH MORE

01:06:51.807 --> 01:06:53.409

VAGUE PLANNERS ACTIVE WORK

01:06:56.912 --> 01:06:57.747
THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT WORK

01:06:57.813 --> 01:06:59.281
THAT'S GOING ON ON A VERY

01:06:59.348 --> 01:07:00.449
INDIVIDUAL BASIS HERE AND MISTER

01:07:00.516 --> 01:07:01.717

WITH COMMENTS THERE THAT SAID

01:07:05.054 --> 01:07:08.557
THERE IS MORE THAT COULD BE DONE.

01:07:08.624 --> 01:07:12.495
YEAH.

01:07:12.561 --> 01:07:14.163
I JUST TOOK MY REMARKS OKAY.

01:07:14.897 --> 01:07:15.464
WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE

01:07:15.531 --> 01:07:17.466
DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION -- A

01:07:17.533 --> 01:07:18.100
COLLEAGUE OF MINE AT SEATED BDA

01:07:18.167 --> 01:07:20.002
WHO'S HERE COLE WROTE THE REPORT.

01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:20.803
THAT GAVE RISE TO THE C. C. R.

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:22.538
LEGISLATION WITH WITH MISTER

01:07:22.605 --> 01:07:24.673
ROSEN SO -- WE'RE FULLY

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:25.741
COMMITTED TO ITS IMPLEMENTATION

01:07:25.808 --> 01:07:27.076
AND CONTINUE TO BELIEVE IT'S THE

01:07:27.143 --> 01:07:28.677
RIGHT WAY TO DO CHILD WELFARE

01:07:28.744 --> 01:07:29.879
SERVICES.

01:07:29.945 --> 01:07:31.981
I POINT OUT THAT THAT CCR ISN'T

01:07:32.047 --> 01:07:33.249
ONE REFORM CC ARE IS NO FEWER

01:07:33.315 --> 01:07:35.251
THAN FIVE MAJOR REFORMS THAT ARE

01:07:35.317 --> 01:07:37.052
ALL BEING UNDERTAKEN AT THE SAME

01:07:37.119 --> 01:07:37.720
TIME.

01:07:37.787 --> 01:07:38.954
WE'RE CHANGING THE WAY WE DO

01:07:39.021 --> 01:07:41.690
SOCIAL WORK WERE CHANGING THE

01:07:41.757 --> 01:07:43.426
NATURE OF RESIDENTIAL.

01:07:43.492 --> 01:07:44.326
CARE INTO INTO SHORT TERM

01:07:44.393 --> 01:07:45.461
TREATMENT WE'RE CHANGING THE WAY

01:07:45.528 --> 01:07:47.696
WE APPROVED FAMILIES WERE

01:07:47.763 --> 01:07:49.732
CHANGING THE LIGHT THE THE RATE

01:07:49.799 --> 01:07:51.167
SYSTEM FOR FAMILIES WERE

01:07:51.233 --> 01:07:54.970
CHANGING THE WAY AND THE NATURE --

01:07:55.037 --> 01:07:56.138
BUT TWO OF THE RELATIONSHIP

01:07:56.205 --> 01:07:57.706
BETWEEN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND

01:07:57.773 --> 01:07:59.842
AND CHILD WELFARE AND ALL OF

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:00.476
THIS IS HAPPENING AT THE SAME

01:08:00.543 --> 01:08:01.377
TIME.

01:08:01.444 --> 01:08:03.145
AND SO I WOULD JUST UNDERSCORE

01:08:03.212 --> 01:08:06.115
WHAT MR JOVANKA SAID THERE'S A

01:08:06.182 --> 01:08:07.016
LOT OF WORK HAPPENING.

01:08:07.082 --> 01:08:08.217
ALL THAT BEING SAID I DO THINK

01:08:08.284 --> 01:08:09.819
IT MAKES SENSE TO TAKE SOME

01:08:09.885 --> 01:08:11.854
STOCK AND HOW IT'S GOING WE MADE

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:13.689
SOME BIG ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT.

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:14.990
WITH C. C. R. WOULD BE ABLE TO

01:08:15.057 --> 01:08:17.092
PRODUCE AND BY WHEN AND I DO

01:08:17.159 --> 01:08:19.094
THINK THAT IT'S FAIR TO SAY.

01:08:19.161 --> 01:08:21.230
SERVE HOW THE GOING AND AS AS

01:08:21.297 --> 01:08:22.298
YOU MIGHT IMAGINE AND AS WE

01:08:22.364 --> 01:08:23.833
SHOULD PROBABLY EXPECT THERE ARE

01:08:23.899 --> 01:08:25.367
SOME THINGS THAT ARE GOING WELL.

01:08:25.434 --> 01:08:26.535
AND THERE ARE SOME AREAS THAT

01:08:26.602 --> 01:08:28.037
ARE STILL VERY MUCH A WORK IN

01:08:28.103 --> 01:08:30.339
PROGRESS AND PROBABLY GIVE RISE

01:08:30.406 --> 01:08:32.475
TO SOME REASON FOR SOME MID

01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:35.411
COURSE THINKING -- AND SO WE

01:08:35.478 --> 01:08:36.846
SORT OF A LINE WITH MR ROSE A

01:08:36.912 --> 01:08:38.514
SENSE OF OF WHAT'S WHAT'S

01:08:38.581 --> 01:08:40.316
WORKING THE REDUCTION IN THE

01:08:40.382 --> 01:08:41.317
NUMBER OF KIDS IN CONGREGATE

01:08:41.383 --> 01:08:43.085
CARE BOTH PROBATION AND CHILD

01:08:43.152 --> 01:08:44.220
WELFARE KIDS.

01:08:44.286 --> 01:08:45.654
CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMING IS A

01:08:45.721 --> 01:08:47.289
MUCH BETTER WAY OF DOING SOCIAL

01:08:47.356 --> 01:08:48.824
WORK FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED AND

01:08:48.891 --> 01:08:50.693
THAT'S WELL UNDER WAY THE

01:08:50.759 --> 01:08:53.496
RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS.

01:08:53.562 --> 01:08:54.763
AS ARGUE WITH HIM LABOR

01:08:54.830 --> 01:08:56.866
INTENSIVE AS IT IS AND AT GET IT

01:08:56.932 --> 01:08:58.100
SO MUCH MORE WORK THAN WE

01:08:58.167 --> 01:09:00.469
ANTICIPATED TO GET THE EXISTING

01:09:00.536 --> 01:09:01.370
CASES SORT OF THROUGH THE

01:09:01.437 --> 01:09:02.671
PIPELINE.

01:09:02.738 --> 01:09:04.373
IT IS A MUCH BETTER WAY. TO

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:06.775
APPROVE AND SUPPORT FAMILIES

01:09:06.842 --> 01:09:08.477
BECAUSE YOU DO A ROBUST HOME

01:09:08.544 --> 01:09:09.612
ASSESSMENT.

01:09:09.678 --> 01:09:12.081
AND SO CARE GIVERS.

01:09:12.147 --> 01:09:13.382
ARE BETTER ABLE TO CARE FOR

01:09:13.449 --> 01:09:15.084
CHILDREN WHERE BET BETTER ABLE

01:09:15.150 --> 01:09:15.684
TO DETERMINE IF IT'S A RIGHT

01:09:15.751 --> 01:09:18.254
MATCH SO I DON'T WANNA GET LOST

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:19.255
IN THE DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR A

01:09:19.321 --> 01:09:20.789
FAIT.

01:09:20.856 --> 01:09:22.791
THE VALUE OF OF IT -- AS A

01:09:22.858 --> 01:09:26.862
DIFFERENT AND BETTER WAY OF

01:09:26.929 --> 01:09:29.365
APPROVING RELATIVES -- AND MANY

01:09:29.431 --> 01:09:29.965
FOSTER FAMILY AGENCIES ARE NOW

01:09:30.032 --> 01:09:31.066
STARTING TO INCREASE THE NUMBER

01:09:31.133 --> 01:09:33.369
OF INTENSIVE SERVICES FOSTER

01:09:33.435 --> 01:09:34.670
CARE FAMILIES.

01:09:34.737 --> 01:09:36.038
THIS IS ONE OF TWO MAJOR

01:09:36.105 --> 01:09:38.173
CATEGORIES OF FAMILY BASED

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.276
PLACEMENTS THAT CC ARE ASSUMED

01:09:40.342 --> 01:09:42.378
WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR KIDS WHO

01:09:42.444 --> 01:09:43.712
WERE IN LOWER LEVEL GROUP COMES

01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:45.247
BUT SHOULDN'T BE LIVING THERE.

01:09:45.314 --> 01:09:46.448
THEY DON'T THEY DON'T NEED

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:47.383
TREATMENT BUT THEY SHOULD BE

01:09:47.449 --> 01:09:48.918
WITH FAMILIES AND WE MADE SOME

01:09:48.984 --> 01:09:50.185
ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT.

01:09:50.252 --> 01:09:52.288
BUILDING OUT INTENSIVE SERVICES

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:53.756
FOSTER CARE AND TREATMENT FOSTER

01:09:53.822 --> 01:09:55.391
CARE WHAT WAS WHICH WAS ACTUALLY

01:09:55.457 --> 01:09:56.458
A REQUIREMENT OF THE KD ES

01:09:56.525 --> 01:09:57.426
SETTLEMENT.

01:09:57.493 --> 01:09:59.428
AN INTENSIVE SERVICES FOSTER

01:09:59.495 --> 01:10:00.996
CARE WE'RE STARTING TO SEE SORT

01:10:01.063 --> 01:10:02.231
OF TAKE OFF.

01:10:02.298 --> 01:10:03.933
THE AREAS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE

01:10:03.999 --> 01:10:05.467
STILL VERY MUCH A WORK AND AND

01:10:05.534 --> 01:10:07.670
AND PROCESS AND THERE ARE SOME

01:10:07.736 --> 01:10:08.804
AREAS OF CONCERN.

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:10.372
ARE ONES THAT YOU'VE HIGHLIGHTED

01:10:10.439 --> 01:10:11.607
ALREADY ONE IS.

01:10:11.674 --> 01:10:13.108
THE RELATIVELY SLOW RATE OF

01:10:13.175 --> 01:10:15.411
CONVERSION OF GROUP HOMES --

01:10:15.477 --> 01:10:18.514
INTO -- S. T. R. TEEPEES.

01:10:18.581 --> 01:10:20.149
ABOUT HALF OF THE KIDS WHO ARE

01:10:20.215 --> 01:10:22.818
IN CONGREGATE CARE ARE IN FILL

01:10:22.885 --> 01:10:24.386
IN FACILITIES RIGHT NOW THAT

01:10:24.453 --> 01:10:27.356
HAVE AN S. T. R. T. P. LICENSE.

01:10:27.423 --> 01:10:29.725
YOU PROVIDED THE AUTHORITY FOR

01:10:29.792 --> 01:10:31.627
US TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW THOSE

01:10:31.694 --> 01:10:32.861
FACILITIES TO CARE FOR THOSE

01:10:32.928 --> 01:10:33.862
CHILDREN.

01:10:33.929 --> 01:10:35.497
UNTIL THE END OF THIS YEAR

01:10:35.564 --> 01:10:36.765
BECAUSE OF THAT.

01:10:36.832 --> 01:10:38.968
SORT OF THAT THAT SLOWER RATE OF

01:10:39.034 --> 01:10:43.138
CONVERSION -- AND WE DO THINK

01:10:43.205 --> 01:10:44.940
THAT FOR MANY OF THOSE

01:10:45.007 --> 01:10:46.642
FACILITIES THEY'RE SMALLER

01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:48.377
FACILITIES THERE COMMUNITY BASED

01:10:48.444 --> 01:10:49.011
FACILITIES.

01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:51.180
MAY.

01:10:51.246 --> 01:10:53.616
THEY ARE QUALITY AND THEY COULD

01:10:53.682 --> 01:10:55.951
BE VERY THERAPEUTIC PLACES FOR

01:10:56.018 --> 01:10:57.186
YOU FOR YOU.

01:10:57.252 --> 01:10:59.321
BUT THE STEPS TO BE CALM

01:10:59.388 --> 01:11:01.156
APPROVED ARE NOT INSIGNIFICANT

01:11:01.223 --> 01:11:02.491
MISTER ROSE.

01:11:02.558 --> 01:11:04.293
OUTLINED SORT OF THE THREE THE

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.028
THREE STEPS AND SO THERE'S BEEN

01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:07.796
A LOT OF WORK TO TRY TO HELP

01:11:07.863 --> 01:11:09.298
THOSE FACILITIES.

01:11:09.365 --> 01:11:11.433
ALONG THE PROCESS OF LICENSING

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:12.601
AND APPROVAL AND THEN

01:11:12.668 --> 01:11:13.902
CONTRACTING.

01:11:13.969 --> 01:11:15.971
BUT I DO THINK IT IT'S TIME AND

01:11:16.038 --> 01:11:18.207
WE ARE BEGINNING TO HAVE THOSE

01:11:18.273 --> 01:11:18.707
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

01:11:18.774 --> 01:11:20.509
ADMINISTRATION. TO THINK ABOUT

01:11:20.576 --> 01:11:21.710
PERHAPS WHETHER WE NEED SOME

01:11:21.777 --> 01:11:23.212
MORE INTENSE SEVEN MORE

01:11:23.278 --> 01:11:24.480
INTENTIONAL.

01:11:24.546 --> 01:11:26.615
SORT OF SPECIFIC TRAINING AND

01:11:26.682 --> 01:11:28.817
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR THOSE.

01:11:28.884 --> 01:11:30.386
IN A FACILITY THAT WE REALLY

01:11:30.452 --> 01:11:32.087
BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT PARTS OF

01:11:32.154 --> 01:11:34.089
THE CARE NETWORK AND WE INTEND

01:11:34.156 --> 01:11:35.824
TO TALK TO THE ADMINISTRATION

01:11:35.891 --> 01:11:36.425
ABOUT.

01:11:36.492 --> 01:11:39.061
IDEAS -- IDEAS FOR DOING JUST

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:43.399
THAT -- THAT CONTRACTING -- THE

01:11:43.465 --> 01:11:44.900
BEHAVIOR HEALTH CONTRACTING

01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:46.969
ISSUE I THINK IT'S ONE THAT THAT

01:11:47.036 --> 01:11:49.438
BEARS KEEPING OUR EYE ON THERE'S

01:11:49.505 --> 01:11:51.273
ONLY NINETEEN S. T. R. T. PEAS

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:53.742
IN THE STATE HAVE HAVE PASSED

01:11:53.809 --> 01:11:57.479
ALL THREE STEPS -- AND SO.

01:11:57.546 --> 01:11:59.648
THERE'S ABOUT NINE HUNDRED

01:11:59.715 --> 01:12:00.783
CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES IN

01:12:00.849 --> 01:12:02.484
THE STATE BUT I SHOULD QUALIFY

01:12:02.551 --> 01:12:03.552
THAT BY SAYING THAT'S NOT

01:12:03.619 --> 01:12:04.887
NECESSARILY TO SAY.

01:12:04.953 --> 01:12:06.455
THAT WE BELIEVE THERE OUGHT TO

01:12:06.522 --> 01:12:09.658
BE NINE HUNDRED BUT BUT NINETEEN

01:12:09.725 --> 01:12:12.628
IS A LOW NUMBER -- AND BOB AS WE

01:12:12.695 --> 01:12:14.997
GET S. T. R. T. PEAS THAT ARE

01:12:15.064 --> 01:12:16.131
IMPORTANT.

01:12:16.198 --> 01:12:17.866
THROUGH THE LICENSING PHASE I

01:12:17.933 --> 01:12:19.601
THINK WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO

01:12:19.668 --> 01:12:21.036
CONTINUE TO PROBLEM SOLVE.

01:12:21.103 --> 01:12:22.771
ABOUT HOW THOSE FACILITIES GET

01:12:22.838 --> 01:12:24.273
MENTAL HEALTH CONTRACTS FROM

01:12:24.339 --> 01:12:25.841
COUNTY MENTAL COUNTY MENTAL

01:12:25.908 --> 01:12:27.710
HEALTH PLANS AND THAT'S AN AREA

01:12:27.776 --> 01:12:28.911
I THINK THE BEARS.

01:12:28.977 --> 01:12:32.414
ARE OUR INTENTIONALITY AND YOUR

01:12:32.481 --> 01:12:34.616
AND AND YOUR OVERSIGHT -- AND

01:12:34.683 --> 01:12:36.118
THEN THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS

01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:37.352
THEM AJ BUT THEY'RE PEDIC FOSTER

01:12:37.419 --> 01:12:38.554
CARE.

01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:41.590
WAS OF AN OUTCOME OF THE KD ES

01:12:41.657 --> 01:12:42.991
SETTLEMENT THE KATIE A LAWSUIT

01:12:43.058 --> 01:12:44.460
WITH THE LAWSUIT THAT THE STATE

01:12:44.526 --> 01:12:47.463
LOST -- THAT -- FOUND THAT THE

01:12:47.529 --> 01:12:50.399
STATE WAS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH

01:12:50.466 --> 01:12:52.000
THE FEDERAL EPA STT LAW.

01:12:52.067 --> 01:12:53.168
AND PART OF COMING INTO

01:12:53.235 --> 01:12:55.304
COMPLIANCE WITH WITH THE PST TO

01:12:55.370 --> 01:12:57.005
THE COURT REQUIRED WITH REST

01:12:57.072 --> 01:12:57.606
THAT DEVELOP TREATMENT FOSTER

01:12:57.673 --> 01:12:58.707
CARE.

01:12:58.774 --> 01:13:00.743
AND THAT'S BEEN VERY SLOW TO GET

01:13:00.809 --> 01:13:03.145
OFF THE GROUND AND AND I DON'T

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:04.813
THINK THAT'S BECAUSE ANYONE'S

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:09.118
BEEN DRAGGING THEIR FEET -- BUT

01:13:09.184 --> 01:13:10.652
WE MADE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT

01:13:10.719 --> 01:13:12.354
WHETHER OR NOT TREATMENT FOSTER

01:13:12.421 --> 01:13:14.056
CARE WOULD BE A VIABLE.

01:13:14.123 --> 01:13:17.726
APPROACH -- TO TO SERVE SOME

01:13:17.793 --> 01:13:20.763
CHILDREN WHO SEE SEE OUR SAYS

01:13:20.829 --> 01:13:22.197
GET OUT OF THE GROUP HOPES.

01:13:22.264 --> 01:13:25.434
BOMB AND I THINK WE NEED TO WORK

01:13:25.501 --> 01:13:27.169
ON EITHER DEVELOPING TREATMENT

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:29.371
FOSTER CARE WITH INTENTIONALITY

01:13:29.438 --> 01:13:31.006
OR COMING UP WITH A CONTINGENCY

01:13:31.073 --> 01:13:32.508
PLAN IF IT TURNS OUT THE

01:13:32.574 --> 01:13:33.609
TREATMENT FOSTER CARE TO IT.

01:13:33.675 --> 01:13:36.445
IT IS PERHAPS NOT VIABLE IN THE

01:13:36.512 --> 01:13:38.013
WAY THAT THAT KATIE A COURT --

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:41.216
THOUGHT IT WAS -- THE LAST AND

01:13:41.283 --> 01:13:43.719
LAST THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT --

01:13:43.786 --> 01:13:46.021
THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS IT'S

01:13:46.088 --> 01:13:47.322
TAKEN MORE TIME.

01:13:47.389 --> 01:13:49.858
THAN PERHAPS SOME ORIGINALLY

01:13:49.925 --> 01:13:51.860
IMAGINED I SHOULD SAY PROBABLY

01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:53.929
NOT MORE TIME THAN MY MEMBERS

01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:56.064
IMAGINE -- BUT WE WERE

01:13:56.131 --> 01:13:59.101
INCREDIBLY AUDACIOUS IN SCOPE AN

01:13:59.168 --> 01:14:00.702
AMBITIOUS AND TIME FRAME.

01:14:00.769 --> 01:14:02.871
AND SO WE'LL TALK LATER ON IN

01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:04.273
THE PROPOSALS FOR INVESTMENT BUT

01:14:04.339 --> 01:14:05.774
OUR MEMBERS EXTREMELY ORRIED

01:14:05.841 --> 01:14:07.442
ABOUT PULLING OUT THE RUG.

01:14:07.509 --> 01:14:09.111
PULLING THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER

01:14:09.178 --> 01:14:11.213
THOSE UP FROM UP FROM UP FRONT

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:14.116
INVESTMENTS LIKE RFA AND THE

01:14:14.183 --> 01:14:17.419
FAMILY STABILITY FUND BECAUSE

01:14:17.486 --> 01:14:18.720
THE FAMILY.

01:14:18.787 --> 01:14:21.156
ARE THE ALTERNATIVE -- TO

01:14:21.223 --> 01:14:21.757
GROUPON PLACEMENTS AND WE ALL

01:14:21.824 --> 01:14:23.158
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE DON'T HAVE

01:14:23.225 --> 01:14:26.562
ENOUGH OF THEM AND IT'S REALLY

01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:27.162
IMPORTANT THAT I THINK THAT WE

01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:27.729
NOT.

01:14:27.796 --> 01:14:30.132
BECAUSE OF AN UNREALISTIC TIME

01:14:30.199 --> 01:14:31.733
FRAME THAT WE SET OUT AT THE

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:33.402
BEGINNING BECAUSE WE WERE REALLY

01:14:33.468 --> 01:14:34.603
AUDACIOUS AN AMBITIOUS.

01:14:34.670 --> 01:14:36.271
THAT WE NOT PULLED THE RUG OUT

01:14:36.338 --> 01:14:36.839
FROM UNDER THE REFORM IN MID

01:14:36.905 --> 01:14:42.644
STREAM.

01:14:42.711 --> 01:14:45.214
WE'RE GOING TO BE SHARING THE

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:48.884
CHAIR SHIP -- WE BOTH HAVE BILLS

01:14:48.951 --> 01:14:49.818
WE'RE PRESENTING.

01:14:49.885 --> 01:14:52.187
SO WE SINCERELY APPRECIATE YOUR

01:14:52.254 --> 01:14:57.659
UNDERSTANDING IN THAT REGARD --

01:14:57.726 --> 01:14:58.594
ALL RIGHT.

01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:00.128
BEFORE THE FIFTY ABSOLUTELY YEAH

01:15:00.195 --> 01:15:02.231
SO SO BEFORE WE CONTINUE OUT WE

01:15:02.297 --> 01:15:03.866
TALKED ABOUT THE NINE HOT.

01:15:03.932 --> 01:15:06.068
NINE HUNDRED OF FACILITIES IN

01:15:06.134 --> 01:15:06.869
NINETEEN HAVE PASSED ALL THREE

01:15:06.935 --> 01:15:09.037
STEPS SOUL CAN YOU ELABORATE

01:15:09.104 --> 01:15:10.439
JUST A LITTLE BIT NOT TOO MUCH

01:15:10.505 --> 01:15:11.974
BUT I JUST WANT TO KNOW.

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.208
IF THERE'S ONLY NINETEEN PASS

01:15:13.275 --> 01:15:15.244
DOES THAT MEAN THAT SOME KIDS

01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:16.845
ARE CURRENTLY IN THOSE

01:15:16.912 --> 01:15:17.512
FACILITIES.

01:15:17.579 --> 01:15:20.249
AND IF THERE IS ONLY NINETEEN

01:15:20.315 --> 01:15:21.383

TO THOSE OTHER COUNTIES OR THAT

01:15:33.362 --> 01:15:34.596

A FACILITY TO CARE FOR A CHILD.

01:15:48.810 --> 01:15:49.311
THEY EITHER HAVE TO HAVE A

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:50.812
CONTRACT TO DELIVER BEHAVIORAL

01:15:50.879 --> 01:15:52.748

ENVISIONED REDUCING THE NUMBER

01:16:16.004 --> 01:16:17.773
OF CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES.

01:16:17.839 --> 01:16:19.641
AND YOUR QUESTION HITS TO A

01:16:19.708 --> 01:16:21.610
CONCERN THAT WE HAVE ONCE WE GET

01:16:21.677 --> 01:16:22.911

01:16:22.978 --> 01:16:24.813
ALL THE FACILITIES QUALITY

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:26.882
FACILITIES THAT CAN MEET THE

01:16:26.949 --> 01:16:28.784
TEST OF C. C. R. EXIST ARE THEY

01:16:28.850 --> 01:16:30.552
WHERE THE KIDS ARE.

01:16:30.619 --> 01:16:32.754

01:16:32.821 --> 01:16:35.257
EXCELLENT AS T. R. T. P. TH --

01:16:35.324 --> 01:16:36.658

TO VICTOR.

01:16:44.299 --> 01:16:46.702
SO -- WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS

01:16:46.768 --> 01:16:48.904
QUESTION BUT I I DON'T I DON'T

01:16:48.971 --> 01:16:49.638
KNOW THAT.

01:16:49.705 --> 01:16:51.173
I CAN SIT HERE RIGHT NOW AND SAY

01:16:51.239 --> 01:16:53.175
WE'RE SURE THAT THERE'S GOING TO

01:16:53.241 --> 01:16:56.178
BE A SUFFICIENT GEOGRAPHIC.

01:16:56.244 --> 01:16:57.646
SORT OF AVAILABILITY.

01:16:57.713 --> 01:17:01.049
OF TREATMENT PROGRAMS WHERE THE

01:17:01.116 --> 01:17:02.150
WHERE THE CHILDREN ARE RESIDING

01:17:02.217 --> 01:17:04.086
AND I KNOW WHAT'S ONE THING THAT

01:17:04.152 --> 01:17:05.253
THE DEPARTMENT IS CROSS MAPPING.

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:07.556
BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE

01:17:07.622 --> 01:17:11.193
TO ACTIVELY MANAGE BYE BYE ON

01:17:11.259 --> 01:17:13.128
FOLLOW UP ON THE THE NOT SO

01:17:13.195 --> 01:17:14.096
THESE.

01:17:14.162 --> 01:17:14.763
NINETEEN HUNDRED FACILITIES THAT

01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:19.267
ARE POTENTIALLY GOING TO BE --

01:17:19.334 --> 01:17:21.103
QUALIFIED ARE THE SEEN CHILDREN

01:17:21.169 --> 01:17:22.604
RIGHT NOW SOLE SO I GUESS MY MY

01:17:22.671 --> 01:17:24.373
QUESTION IS ARE THEIR KIDS

01:17:24.439 --> 01:17:26.041
CURRENTLY BEING SEEN.

01:17:26.108 --> 01:17:27.576
OKAY SO THAT THAT MAKES MORE

01:17:27.642 --> 01:17:28.377
SENSE THEY'RE NOT.

01:17:28.443 --> 01:17:29.945
EMPTY AND JUST WAITING FOR THE

01:17:30.012 --> 01:17:31.680
APPROVAL PART PROCESS ARE STILL

01:17:31.747 --> 01:17:32.614
SEEING CHILDREN BUT YOU HAVE A

01:17:32.681 --> 01:17:33.181
RACK SO.

01:17:33.248 --> 01:17:36.051
ALL OF THOSE FACILITIES HAVE --

01:17:36.118 --> 01:17:38.453
HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THEM SOME

01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:40.522
SOME ARE STILL MAINTAINING THEIR

01:17:40.589 --> 01:17:42.624
GROUP HOME LICENSE AND FOOD AND

01:17:42.691 --> 01:17:43.859
AND MEETING THOSE OUGHT THAT

01:17:43.925 --> 01:17:45.293
LEVEL OF CARE OBLIGATION.

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.062
SOME ARE LICENSED AS AS SHORT

01:17:47.129 --> 01:17:48.163
TERM RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT

01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:49.798
PROGRAMS BUT DON'T YET HAVE A

01:17:49.865 --> 01:17:51.733
MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM SO THEY'RE

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:53.468
AT THEIR MEETING THAT THAT THE

01:17:53.535 --> 01:17:55.404
HIGHER ACUITY NEEDS OF YOUNG

01:17:55.470 --> 01:17:58.507
PEOPLE BYE BYE -- BY ARRANGING

01:17:58.573 --> 01:18:00.042
FOR OR ARE PARTNERING WITH LOCAL

01:18:00.108 --> 01:18:01.076
MENTAL HEALTH TO ARRANGE FOR

01:18:01.143 --> 01:18:04.212
THAT THE SERVICES AND THEN

01:18:04.279 --> 01:18:05.113
NINETEEN ARE FULLY INTEGRATED ON

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:05.414
THIS POINT.

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:06.848
SO THERE THERE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE

01:18:06.915 --> 01:18:10.152
IS BEING SERVED IN THOSE THERE

01:18:10.218 --> 01:18:10.819
ARE A GROUP THE GROUP I

01:18:10.886 --> 01:18:12.754
MENTIONED EARLIER THE EIGHT

01:18:12.821 --> 01:18:14.990
HUNDRED OR SO THAT -- THAT WON'T

01:18:15.057 --> 01:18:16.658
MEET S. T. R. T. P. REQUIREMENTS

01:18:16.725 --> 01:18:18.393
THAT ARE IN SOME OF THAT --

01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:19.461
BECAUSE THE CURRENT CONGREGATE

01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:21.396
CARE FACILITIES THAT MAKE THAT

01:18:21.463 --> 01:18:22.364
HAVE TOLD US EITHER THEY'RE NOT

01:18:22.431 --> 01:18:24.699
GONNA TRANSITION OR IT SEEMS

01:18:24.766 --> 01:18:25.600
UNLIKELY THEY WILL ARE THE THAT

01:18:25.667 --> 01:18:27.169
GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE THE

01:18:27.235 --> 01:18:29.137
THE THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WE AND

01:18:29.204 --> 01:18:30.472
THE DEPARTMENT ARE WORKING WITH

01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:31.440
OUR COUNTY COLLEAGUES.

01:18:31.506 --> 01:18:34.509
ON AT IMMEDIATELY TO LOCATE --

01:18:34.576 --> 01:18:36.445
FAMILIES ARE ALL OF THAT CAN

01:18:36.511 --> 01:18:39.815
CARE FOR THEM IF IN JUST I AGREE

01:18:39.881 --> 01:18:45.053
WITH EVERYTHING THAT MR ROSE

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:46.388
SAID -- WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE IS

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:46.888
THAT GOING FORWARD THOSE

01:18:46.955 --> 01:18:47.923
FACILITIES THAT ARE RECEIVING

01:18:47.989 --> 01:18:49.057
AND CARING FOR CHILDREN NOW WHO

01:18:49.124 --> 01:18:51.326
AREN'T FULLY LICENSED -- AT SOME

01:18:51.393 --> 01:18:51.860
POINT THEY HAVE TO MAKE A

01:18:51.927 --> 01:18:53.395
DECISION RIGHT TO CONTINUE IN

01:18:53.462 --> 01:18:55.530
THE LIMBO PERIOD OR DECIDE THIS

01:18:55.597 --> 01:18:58.500
IS NOT -- A SERVICE THAT WE CAN

01:18:58.567 --> 01:18:59.768
CONTINUE TO MEET.

01:18:59.835 --> 01:19:01.870
AND FOR THOSE THAT EITHER CAN'T

01:19:01.937 --> 01:19:04.439
OR DON'T WANT TO CONTINUE TO TO

01:19:04.506 --> 01:19:06.508
BE AN S. T. R. T. P..

01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:08.276
IT'S IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT THEY

01:19:08.343 --> 01:19:10.312
NOT BECOME PART OF THE THE S. T.

01:19:10.378 --> 01:19:12.481
R. T. PEMEX BUT FOR THOSE.

01:19:12.547 --> 01:19:14.916
THAT CAN AND ARE NECESSARY AND

01:19:14.983 --> 01:19:16.785
COULD BE GOOD PROVIDERS WHAT WE

01:19:16.852 --> 01:19:18.620
DON'T WANT IS FOR THEM. TO GIVE

01:19:18.687 --> 01:19:20.789
UP AND SAID THIS IS THIS IS WAY

01:19:20.856 --> 01:19:22.424
TOO MANY HURDLES FOR US WE'RE

01:19:22.491 --> 01:19:22.991
OUT.

01:19:23.058 --> 01:19:25.760
AND AND IT'S IT'S THAT.

01:19:25.827 --> 01:19:27.028
I MEAN IN THE SHORT RUN THEY'RE

01:19:27.095 --> 01:19:28.263
THEY'RE CARING FOR AND SOME OF

01:19:28.330 --> 01:19:30.632
THEM ARE CARING FOR KIDS BUT AT

01:19:30.699 --> 01:19:31.733
SOME POINT.

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.201

THANK YOU.

01:19:43.245 --> 01:19:45.747
IT ENDS IN DECEMBER.

01:19:45.814 --> 01:19:46.681
IS THAT CORRECT WHAT ENDS IN

01:19:46.748 --> 01:19:47.749
DEATH WHAT ENDS IN DECEMBER IS

01:19:47.816 --> 01:19:49.584
THE PERIOD AFTER DECEMBER ANY

01:19:53.822 --> 01:19:54.856
CARE FACILITY THAT DOES NOT HAVE

IS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR STATE

01:19:59.361 --> 01:20:01.062
REIMBURSEMENT.

01:20:01.129 --> 01:20:03.398
SO IN FACT GIVEN THE GIVEN THE

01:20:03.465 --> 01:20:05.901
COST IT IT SORT OF MEANS THAT

01:20:05.967 --> 01:20:07.302
THAT PLACEMENT BECOMES.

01:20:07.369 --> 01:20:09.004

CONDITIONS THAT I COUNTY COULD

01:20:17.746 --> 01:20:20.448
ASK FOR AN EXTENSION IF IT

01:20:20.515 --> 01:20:21.917
PROVED TO THE STATE.

01:20:21.983 --> 01:20:23.084
EXCUSE ME THAT IT WAS TAKING.

01:20:23.151 --> 01:20:26.621
APPROPRIATE STEPS TO TRY -- TO

01:20:26.688 --> 01:20:30.091
GET FAMILIES AND TO GET S. T. R.

01:20:30.158 --> 01:20:30.659
TO HELP GET US YOUR TEEPEES

01:20:30.725 --> 01:20:30.926
APPROVED.

01:20:30.992 --> 01:20:31.826
THE QUESTION THAT THAT OUR

01:20:31.893 --> 01:20:34.296
MEMBERS BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO

01:20:34.362 --> 01:20:35.597
ANSWER WITH YOU AND WITH THE

01:20:35.664 --> 01:20:37.566
ADMINISTRATION BEFORE THIS

01:20:37.632 --> 01:20:40.202
BUDGET AND IS DO WE THINK

01:20:40.268 --> 01:20:41.970
DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF

01:20:42.037 --> 01:20:42.938
NINETEEN CONTINUES TO BE A

01:20:43.004 --> 01:20:43.939
REASONABLE DATE.

01:20:44.005 --> 01:20:45.907
AND I BELIEVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS

01:20:45.974 --> 01:20:49.511
WILL START PROBABLY TOMORROW

01:20:49.578 --> 01:20:53.548
MORNING AROUND EIGHT O'CLOCK.

01:20:53.615 --> 01:20:55.450
CLEARLY THAT WOULD BE THE NEXT

01:20:55.517 --> 01:20:58.920
BEST A PARTY BUT NUMBER SAID SHE

01:20:58.987 --> 01:21:01.223
IS A BAR IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE

01:21:01.289 --> 01:21:02.190
THAT IT'S GOING TO BED THAT.

01:21:02.257 --> 01:21:03.158
ALL THE FACILITIES THAT THAT WE

01:21:03.225 --> 01:21:04.759
WANT BECAUSE THEY DELIVER GOOD

01:21:04.826 --> 01:21:06.528
CARE AND THEY CAN REALLY -- NEED

01:21:06.595 --> 01:21:08.597
A CHILD'S NEEDS TO HEAL -- IT'S

01:21:08.663 --> 01:21:10.665
HARD TO IMAGINE THAT ALL OF THEM

01:21:10.732 --> 01:21:13.702
WILL WILL GET PAST THE FINISH

01:21:13.768 --> 01:21:15.203
LINE BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST.

01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:16.037
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S NOT GOING

01:21:16.104 --> 01:21:18.707
TO BE REASONABLE TO EXPECT IT TO

01:21:18.773 --> 01:21:20.075
HAPPEN BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST.

01:21:20.141 --> 01:21:21.676
IT IS IT YOUR INTENTION THAN TO

01:21:21.743 --> 01:21:24.012
ASK FOR AN EXTENSION. TO ANY TO

01:21:24.079 --> 01:21:27.182
BEGIN THAT PROCESS.

01:21:27.249 --> 01:21:28.316
THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WERE ABOUT

01:21:28.383 --> 01:21:29.551
TO HAVE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION

01:21:29.618 --> 01:21:32.187
IS TO SORT OF IDENTIFY WHETHER

01:21:32.254 --> 01:21:33.555
OR NOT WE HAVE A SORT OF A

01:21:33.622 --> 01:21:35.557
COMMON ASSESSMENT OF THE

01:21:35.624 --> 01:21:37.959
LIKELIHOOD OF DECEMBER THIRTY

01:21:38.026 --> 01:21:38.893
FIRST BEING REASONABLE OR NOT

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:41.296
AND AND IF IT TURNS OUT THAT MY

01:21:41.363 --> 01:21:43.598
SUPPOSITION HERE TODAY -- IS

01:21:43.665 --> 01:21:45.100
BORNE OUT IN THE ADMINISTRATION

01:21:45.166 --> 01:21:46.968
CAN KERR'S WE WOULD NEED A

01:21:47.035 --> 01:21:50.672
STATUTORY CHANGE TO ALLOW -- FOR

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:52.374
EXCEPTIONS AND I ASSUME THE

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:54.309
ADMINISTRATION WOULD WOULD WANT

01:21:54.376 --> 01:21:56.311
TO SIMILARLY.

01:21:56.378 --> 01:21:59.247
ENSURE THAT -- ANNEKE.

01:21:59.314 --> 01:22:00.515
IN THOSE CASES WERE EXTENSIONS

01:22:00.582 --> 01:22:03.518
OCCUR DUE DILIGENCE AS BEING

01:22:03.585 --> 01:22:04.352
MATT.

01:22:04.419 --> 01:22:06.588
AND TERMS OF FINDING FAMILIES

01:22:06.655 --> 01:22:08.990
AND AND BECAUSE IT'S NO ONE'S

01:22:09.057 --> 01:22:11.559
INTENT. TO HAVE AN INDEFINITE

01:22:11.626 --> 01:22:14.362
PERIOD OF YOU KNOW OF OF OF

01:22:14.429 --> 01:22:16.498

CONTINUED TO CARE FOR KIDS.

01:22:19.834 --> 01:22:25.206
BUT IF WE ONLY HAVE NINETEEN OF

01:22:25.273 --> 01:22:29.244
FIVE MILLION.

01:22:29.311 --> 01:22:30.245
NINE HUNDRED THAT'S WHAT THERE

01:22:30.312 --> 01:22:30.412

01:22:30.478 --> 01:22:32.080
OTHER THERE ARE WORTH IT I'M

01:22:32.147 --> 01:22:32.714

THEY'VE GOT TO GO SOMEWHERE AND

01:22:37.552 --> 01:22:37.986
IF THERE ISN'T A FAMILY

01:22:38.053 --> 01:22:38.286
[inaudible]

01:22:38.353 --> 01:22:41.323
WE CAN'T PUT HIM ON THE STREET

01:22:41.389 --> 01:22:43.558
IT'S ABOUT HALF OF THE KIDS --

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:45.660

DEADLINE AND SO IT'S THE THE

01:22:57.305 --> 01:23:01.443
TEST WOULD BE FINDING FAMILIES

01:23:01.509 --> 01:23:05.613
FOR FOR THOSE CHILDREN OR END.

01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:08.416
OR BY GETTING THOSE FACILITIES

01:23:08.483 --> 01:23:09.851

01:23:09.918 --> 01:23:12.821

OUR OUR MUTUAL EFFORTS IN THIS

01:23:24.699 --> 01:23:27.035
INVOLVES HELP FROM THE STATE.

01:23:27.102 --> 01:23:28.670

PAST TWELVE THIRTY ONE NINETEEN

01:23:36.778 --> 01:23:38.880
AND IT'S HARD FOR US TO IMAGINE.

01:23:38.947 --> 01:23:42.784
THAT THAT WOULD BE THE CASE THIS

01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:46.321
REVIEW YES.

01:23:46.388 --> 01:23:48.022

01:28:57.732 --> 01:28:59.333
PRIORITY FROM THE ADMINISTRATION

INVESTMENT INDICATED THAT THERE

01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:13.481
WERE SOME WILLINGNESS FROM THAT

01:29:13.548 --> 01:29:15.650
THE ADMINISTRATION TO CONTINUE

THAN THAN -- THAN THE

01:29:33.301 --> 01:29:34.435
ADMINISTRATION WILL COMPLY BUT

01:29:34.502 --> 01:29:36.204
THE NICHOLS CAUGHT UP BACK TO

01:29:36.270 --> 01:29:37.839
WHAT YOU ORIGINALLY SAID THAT.

01:29:37.905 --> 01:29:39.006
THEY WERE MAINTAINING THE

01:29:39.073 --> 01:29:40.742
ORIGINAL INVESTMENT THE IN IT

01:29:40.808 --> 01:29:42.543
JUST THERE THERE'S NO INTENT

01:29:42.610 --> 01:29:44.378
ISN'T WHAT MY QUESTION IS ARE MY

01:29:44.445 --> 01:29:45.947
POINT IS.

01:29:46.013 --> 01:29:50.284
BY THE NINE INVESTMENT THIS TIME.

01:29:50.351 --> 01:29:56.491
AND MADAME CHAIRS -- THE FROM

01:29:56.557 --> 01:29:57.492
THIS FROM THIS THAT FROM THE

01:29:57.558 --> 01:29:58.126
STANDPOINT OF THE COUNTIES THAT

01:29:58.192 --> 01:29:59.360
ARE THAT ARE IMPLEMENTING THIS

01:29:59.427 --> 01:30:00.628
REFORM ON YOUR BEHALF WE ASSUMED

01:30:00.695 --> 01:30:01.562
A LOT OF THINGS THREE YEARS AGO.

01:30:01.629 --> 01:30:03.831
SO IT MAY BE TRUE THAT THREE

01:30:03.898 --> 01:30:06.701
YEARS AGO WE ASSUMED THAT WE

01:30:06.768 --> 01:30:07.301
WOULD HAVE ALL THE FAMILIES WE

01:30:07.368 --> 01:30:09.704
NEEDED -- WE ASSUMED THAT ALL

01:30:09.771 --> 01:30:10.938
THE S. T. R. T. PIECE WOULD HAVE

01:30:11.005 --> 01:30:12.373
CONVERTED.

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:14.275
THE KD ES COURT ASSUME WE HAVE

01:30:14.342 --> 01:30:15.943
TREATMENT FOSTER CARE WE ASSUMED

01:30:16.010 --> 01:30:17.845
A LOT OF THINGS SOME OF THEM

01:30:17.912 --> 01:30:19.947
HAPPENED AND SOME OF THEM DID

01:30:20.014 --> 01:30:21.616
NOT AND SO.

01:30:21.682 --> 01:30:23.951
IT SEEMS I WOULD ASK THE

01:30:24.018 --> 01:30:25.853
ADMINISTRATION THAT INHERITED CC

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:26.287
ARE FROM THE PRIOR%

01:30:26.354 --> 01:30:28.356
ADMINISTRATION TO UNDERSTAND

01:30:28.422 --> 01:30:31.492
THAT -- WE'RE ALL IN GOOD FAITH

01:30:31.559 --> 01:30:33.227
MAKING MID COURSE CORRECTIONS

01:30:33.294 --> 01:30:34.262
AND WORKING AS HARD AS WE

01:30:34.328 --> 01:30:36.430
POSSIBLY CAN TO IMPLEMENT THIS

01:30:36.497 --> 01:30:38.933
REFORM SOME THINGS ARE GOING AS

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.334
PLANNED AND SOME THINGS AREN'T.

01:30:40.401 --> 01:30:42.136
SO TO SAY WELL THREE YEARS AGO

01:30:42.203 --> 01:30:43.271
WE THOUGHT IT WAS ALL GOING TO

01:30:43.337 --> 01:30:44.672
BE DONE AND IT'S NOT SO IF YOU

01:30:44.739 --> 01:30:45.840
WANT TO DO IT AFTER THREE YEARS

01:30:45.907 --> 01:30:47.275
IT'S ON YOU BUT THAT'S NOT OUR

01:30:47.341 --> 01:30:48.442
PRIORITY.

01:30:48.509 --> 01:30:49.644
I DON'T THINK THAT THAT IS AN

01:30:49.710 --> 01:30:51.445
APPROPRIATE WAY TO VIEW OUR

01:30:51.512 --> 01:30:52.980
RESPONSIBILITY TO IMPLEMENT

01:30:53.047 --> 01:30:54.916
CURRENT LAW BECAUSE CCAR'S

01:30:54.982 --> 01:30:56.450
CURRENT LAW.

01:30:56.517 --> 01:30:58.286
AND IF WE'RE ALL TOGETHER MAKING

01:30:58.352 --> 01:31:00.354
A GOOD FAITH MID COURSE

01:31:00.421 --> 01:31:02.223
CORRECTIONS AND ASSESSMENT OF

01:31:02.290 --> 01:31:03.658
HOW WELL WE'RE DOING.

01:31:03.724 --> 01:31:04.859
THEN WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

01:31:04.926 --> 01:31:06.594
THOSE SAME ADJUSTMENTS ON THE

01:31:06.661 --> 01:31:08.262
FINANCING SIDE.

01:31:08.329 --> 01:31:09.864
I THINK THAT THE THE BOTTOM LINE

01:31:09.931 --> 01:31:11.032
IS.

01:31:11.098 --> 01:31:13.167
ARE THESE REDUCTIONS GOING TO

01:31:13.234 --> 01:31:15.837
HELP OR HURT C. C. R..

01:31:15.903 --> 01:31:16.838
AND I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE

01:31:16.904 --> 01:31:18.973
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:20.441
HURT IT I MEAN I ASSUME WE CAN

01:31:20.508 --> 01:31:21.742
ALL AGREE THAT THE REDUCTIONS

01:31:21.809 --> 01:31:22.910
WILL HURT IT.

01:31:22.977 --> 01:31:24.378
I THINK THAT THE THE IF WE TALK

01:31:24.445 --> 01:31:26.614
ABOUT PRIORITIES IT ISN'T

01:31:26.681 --> 01:31:28.316
LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY ONLY I

01:31:28.382 --> 01:31:29.350
THINK IT HAS TO BE A MUTUAL

01:31:29.417 --> 01:31:30.585
PRIORITY.

01:31:30.651 --> 01:31:32.053
AND I THINK IF WE VIEW IT THAT

01:31:32.119 --> 01:31:35.189
WAY JUST AS YOU SAID WE'RE ALL

01:31:35.256 --> 01:31:36.624
IN THIS TOGETHER.

01:31:36.691 --> 01:31:38.593
ARE WE WE WE END.

01:31:38.659 --> 01:31:40.428
WE HAVE TO AT TIMES TAKE A

01:31:40.494 --> 01:31:41.929
REFRESHED LOOK.

01:31:41.996 --> 01:31:43.764
AT ANY VALUATION AS OPPOSED TO

01:31:43.831 --> 01:31:45.700
SAYING THIS IS WHAT WE DECIDED

01:31:45.766 --> 01:31:46.767
ON AND THAT'S IT.

01:31:46.834 --> 01:31:48.970
EVERY YEAR I THINK WE NEED TO

01:31:49.036 --> 01:31:51.405
LOOK AT THIS AGAIN AND YOU'RE

01:31:51.472 --> 01:31:52.840
RIGHT WE'RE ALL TRYING TO DO.

01:31:52.907 --> 01:31:54.408
THE ABSOLUTE BEST THAT WE CAN

01:31:54.475 --> 01:31:56.277
WILL HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF

01:31:56.344 --> 01:31:57.712
RESPONSIBILITY DIFFERENT LEVELS

01:31:57.778 --> 01:32:00.548
OF EXPERTISE TO BE ABLE TO OFFER

01:32:00.615 --> 01:32:02.383
MORE TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE

01:32:02.450 --> 01:32:03.517
DO IN THE END.

01:32:03.584 --> 01:32:07.255
WILL HELP US TAKE CARE OF THAT

01:32:07.321 --> 01:32:08.522
SUIT THE C. C. R..

01:32:08.589 --> 01:32:10.491
IT HELPS TO TO REACH THE THE THE

01:32:10.558 --> 01:32:13.060
GOALS THAT WE WANT FROM THE C.

01:32:13.127 --> 01:32:14.795
C. OURS THIS WAS ONE OF ONE

01:32:14.862 --> 01:32:15.529
ADDITIONAL COMMENT MISTER FOR

01:32:15.596 --> 01:32:18.566
THIS -- I SAT HERE FIVE FOR TWO

01:32:18.633 --> 01:32:19.767

ALL OF THAT WHICH IS REALLY

01:32:29.777 --> 01:32:31.712
FRUSTRATING AND I SAW THIS

01:32:31.779 --> 01:32:32.613
GOVERNOR.

01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:34.715

01:32:34.782 --> 01:32:36.918
WITH HOPE WITH -- MORE

01:32:36.984 --> 01:32:39.387

PARTNERS IN THIS AND AND AGAIN

01:32:50.698 --> 01:32:52.300
FOR ME IT WAS HOPEFUL TO HEAR

01:40:35.262 --> 01:40:38.732
AND THIS IS NOT THE TIME.

01:40:38.799 --> 01:40:40.868

THESE PROGRAMS OFF THE GROUND.

01:41:40.394 --> 01:41:42.830
UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF THAT MONEY

01:41:42.896 --> 01:41:44.665

CHANGE IS HARD CHANGES DIFFICULT

01:43:14.821 --> 01:43:16.256
WE NEED MORE FAMILIES THAT'S WHY

01:43:16.323 --> 01:43:17.958
THE STATE INVESTED IN THE SYSTEM

01:43:18.025 --> 01:43:19.493

01:43:29.436 --> 01:43:32.439
WHAT I DIDN'T JUMP IN AND SAY AT

01:43:32.506 --> 01:43:32.873
THE TIME.

ONLY OTHER THING THAT I WOULD

01:43:58.298 --> 01:44:00.467
ADD TO THIS IS THAT -- AS WE'VE

01:44:00.534 --> 01:44:01.969
SEEN WITH OTHER INVESTMENTS LIKE

THE RFA BACKLOG REDUCTION.

01:44:04.738 --> 01:44:06.139
WHEN WE PUT MONEY INTO SOMETHING

01:44:06.206 --> 01:44:07.674
BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:44:07.741 --> 01:44:08.775
WE SHOULD ALSO BE CLEAR ABOUT

01:44:08.842 --> 01:44:10.410
WHAT WE EXPECT TO GET OUT OF

01:44:10.477 --> 01:44:11.678

PROBATION YOUTH.

01:47:36.850 --> 01:47:38.585
SO THAT MIGHT BE AN EXAMPLE OF

01:47:38.652 --> 01:47:40.053

I CAN'T BEGIN TO TELL YOU HOW

01:49:02.802 --> 01:49:06.039
HAPPY I AM TO BE HERE TODAY --

01:49:06.106 --> 01:49:07.474
MY NAME'S KEN BERWICK I'M THE

01:49:07.540 --> 01:49:08.141
FOUNDER AND CEO OF SENECA FAMILY

01:49:08.208 --> 01:49:11.945
OF AGENCIES WHERE ONE OF THOSE

01:49:12.012 --> 01:49:12.512
NINETEEN STI TEEPEES IN THE

01:49:12.579 --> 01:49:12.746
STATE.

01:49:12.812 --> 01:49:14.080
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WERE ONE OF

01:49:14.147 --> 01:49:15.348
THE LARGEST WRAPAROUND PROVIDERS

01:49:15.415 --> 01:49:16.416
IN THE STATE.

01:49:16.483 --> 01:49:17.984
AND WE PROVIDE SERVICES ACROSS

01:49:18.051 --> 01:49:19.686
CHILD WELFARE MENTAL HEALTH

01:49:19.753 --> 01:49:22.055
JUVENILE JUSTICE AND EDUCATION

01:49:22.122 --> 01:49:24.324
IN INTEGRATED SYSTEMS. TO THAT

01:49:24.391 --> 01:49:26.159
END AND BECAUSE OF THAT WORK

01:49:26.226 --> 01:49:28.528
WE'VE SEEN UP CLOSE.

01:49:28.595 --> 01:49:30.897
THE IMPACTS OF SOME OF THE GAPS

01:49:30.964 --> 01:49:32.565
IN OUR SERVICE SYSTEM FOR KIDS

01:49:32.632 --> 01:49:33.533
AND FAMILIES.

01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:35.435
AND SEEING THOSE GAPS THREE

01:49:35.502 --> 01:49:36.836
YEARS AGO WE GOT A GRANT FROM

01:49:36.903 --> 01:49:38.338
THE IRVINE FOUNDATION. TO BRING

01:49:38.405 --> 01:49:41.441
LEADERS IN THE STATE TOGETHER TO

01:49:41.508 --> 01:49:43.143
LOOK AT HI NEEDS YOU.

01:49:43.209 --> 01:49:44.077
AND THE SAY ONE OF THE THINGS

01:49:44.144 --> 01:49:47.447
THAT COULD BE MOST IMPACTFUL FOR

01:49:47.514 --> 01:49:48.448
THOSE WHO.

01:49:48.515 --> 01:49:49.749
AND AND THROUGH THAT PROCESS

01:49:49.816 --> 01:49:51.618
WHAT WE SAW IS THAT YOUTH ARE

01:49:51.685 --> 01:49:52.852
ENDING UP.

01:49:52.919 --> 01:49:54.621
IN HOSPITALS.

01:49:54.688 --> 01:49:56.256
IN JUVENILE HALLS.

01:49:56.323 --> 01:49:57.824
AND HOMELESS.

01:49:57.891 --> 01:49:59.359
THAT NEVER NEEDED TO BE.

01:49:59.426 --> 01:50:00.393
AND THEY DIDN'T NEED TO BE

01:50:00.460 --> 01:50:01.728
BECAUSE THERE ARE MOMENTS IN

01:50:01.795 --> 01:50:03.330
THOSE WHOSE LIFE AND THEIR

01:50:03.396 --> 01:50:04.531
FAMILIES LIVE.

01:50:04.597 --> 01:50:06.232
WHERE WE CAN OPTIONALLY

01:50:06.299 --> 01:50:08.301
INTERVENE USING A MOBILE CRISIS

01:50:08.368 --> 01:50:10.770
RESPONSE SYSTEM THAT CAN CHANGE

01:50:10.837 --> 01:50:11.871
THEIR TRAJECTORY?

01:50:11.938 --> 01:50:14.107
THE TRUTH IS I DON'T THINK WE

01:50:14.174 --> 01:50:15.875
KNOW HOW MANY S. T. R. T. P.

01:50:15.942 --> 01:50:16.743
BETS WE NEED IN THE STATE.

01:50:16.810 --> 01:50:17.978
I DON'T THINK WE KNOW HOW MANY

01:50:18.044 --> 01:50:20.113
FOSTER VETS WE NEED IN THE STATE

01:50:20.180 --> 01:50:21.114
BECAUSE UNTIL WE BUILD THAT ARE

01:50:21.181 --> 01:50:23.216
OUR SYSTEM OF FOSTER CARE WE

01:50:23.283 --> 01:50:24.284
DON'T KNOW HOW MANY US T. I. T.

01:50:24.351 --> 01:50:25.819
PEOPLE AT TWENTY EIGHT AND UNTIL

01:50:25.885 --> 01:50:26.653
WE BUILD OUTS THAT THINGS LIKE

01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:28.188
MOBILE RESPONSE.

01:50:28.254 --> 01:50:29.856
THAT DIVERT KIDS AN OPPORTUNITY

01:50:29.923 --> 01:50:32.892
MOMENTS INTO AWAY FROM PLACES

01:50:32.959 --> 01:50:34.761
LIKE HOSPITALS AND GROUP CARE

01:50:34.828 --> 01:50:36.863
AND INTO MORE -- SUPPORTED HOME

01:50:36.930 --> 01:50:38.498
BASED SERVICES THEN WE'LL KNOW

01:50:38.565 --> 01:50:43.336
WHAT WE NEED FOR HIGHER AND

01:50:43.403 --> 01:50:43.870
SERVICE.

01:50:43.937 --> 01:50:44.571
WE'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF

01:50:44.637 --> 01:50:45.472
RUNNING FOR CONTRA COSTA AND SAN

01:50:45.538 --> 01:50:47.140
FRANCISCO MOBILE RESPONSE TEAMS.

01:50:47.207 --> 01:50:47.774
AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN I STARTED I

01:50:47.841 --> 01:50:49.275
HAD WRITTEN DOWN HERE OF THAT

01:50:49.342 --> 01:50:51.978
WE'VE SEEN IN 80% DIVERSION RATE

01:50:52.045 --> 01:50:53.913
BUT OUR CLINICAL DIRECTOR IS

01:50:53.980 --> 01:50:55.682
HERE TODAY AND SHE REMINDED ME

01:50:55.749 --> 01:50:58.351
THAT WAS EIGHTY THREE POINT

01:50:58.418 --> 01:51:01.254
SOMETHING PERCENT.

01:51:01.321 --> 01:51:02.188
YOU CAN'T FORGET THE DECIMAL

01:51:02.255 --> 01:51:02.689
POINT.

01:51:02.756 --> 01:51:05.225
THE BOTTOM LINE IS MORE THAN

01:51:05.291 --> 01:51:06.693
EIGHT OUT OF TEN KIDS DON'T END

01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:09.729
UP IN A HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM

01:51:09.796 --> 01:51:11.164
GOING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK.

01:51:11.231 --> 01:51:12.565
THEY DON'T END UP IN JUVENILE

01:51:12.632 --> 01:51:14.401
HALL AND THEY DON'T USE A LOCAL

01:51:14.467 --> 01:51:16.302
POLICE OFFICER AS THEIR CRISIS

01:51:16.369 --> 01:51:17.637
COUNSELOR.

01:51:17.704 --> 01:51:19.406
AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR

01:51:19.472 --> 01:51:20.673
CURRENT SYSTEM A YOUTH IS IN

01:51:20.740 --> 01:51:22.842
CRISIS THE PARENT DOESN'T KNOW

01:51:22.909 --> 01:51:24.978
WHO OR WHAT WHO TO CALL OR HOW

01:51:25.045 --> 01:51:25.745
TO GET HELP.

01:51:25.812 --> 01:51:27.147
IN THE END UP COMING INTO A

01:51:27.213 --> 01:51:28.915
SYSTEM THAT WAS NEVER DESIGNED

01:51:28.982 --> 01:51:30.383
TO MEET THEIR NEEDS AND TO KEEP

01:51:30.450 --> 01:51:32.152
THEM OUT OF HIGHER AND SYSTEMS

01:51:32.218 --> 01:51:33.486
AND PROVIDE SUPPORT.

01:51:33.553 --> 01:51:35.755
WE'VE DONE SO MUCH IN THE STATE

01:51:35.822 --> 01:51:37.424
BY PROVIDING WRAPAROUND SERVICES

01:51:37.490 --> 01:51:39.426
ACROSS THE STATE BY CREATING

01:51:39.492 --> 01:51:41.661
SYSTEMS TO INTERVENE AND SCHOOLS

01:51:41.728 --> 01:51:43.630
BY CREATING SYSTEMS THAT CAN

01:51:43.696 --> 01:51:44.731
INTERVENE EARLIER.

01:51:44.798 --> 01:51:46.299
THROUGH THE PROCESS OF THE OF

01:51:46.366 --> 01:51:47.967
THE IRVINE GRANT AND TALKING

01:51:48.034 --> 01:51:49.202
WITH LEADERS AROUND THE STATE

01:51:49.269 --> 01:51:49.969
ABOUT WHAT WE COULD DO

01:51:50.036 --> 01:51:51.738
DIFFERENTLY I BELIEVE THERE IS

01:51:51.805 --> 01:51:53.306
NOTHING WE CAN DO.

01:51:53.373 --> 01:51:55.575
THAT WOULD BE MORE IMPORTANT AND

01:51:55.642 --> 01:51:57.210
MORE IMPACTFUL THAN TO PROVIDE

01:51:57.277 --> 01:51:59.145
STATEWIDE URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEM

01:51:59.212 --> 01:52:00.980
I'M HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND

01:52:01.047 --> 01:52:02.048
JOHANNA IS HERE TO ANSWER YOUR

01:52:02.115 --> 01:52:04.350
QUESTIONS BECAUSE SHE ACTUALLY

01:52:04.417 --> 01:52:07.954
KNOWS WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT.

01:52:08.021 --> 01:52:09.622
WE CALLED JOHANNA I THINK WE

01:52:09.689 --> 01:52:23.503
SHOULD.

01:52:23.570 --> 01:52:26.739

01:52:32.946 --> 01:52:38.651
QUESTIONS.

01:52:38.718 --> 01:52:41.254
DOMINANCE HOW MY PROGRAM.

01:52:41.321 --> 01:52:42.388
SO WE'VE BEEN RUNNING OUR

01:52:42.455 --> 01:52:43.756
PROGRAMS ARE IT WOULD YOU GAVE

01:52:43.823 --> 01:52:44.958
YOU MADE IT FOR THE HARSH AS I

01:52:45.024 --> 01:52:46.559
THOUGHT ARE COMING UP FOR ONE

01:52:46.626 --> 01:52:48.228
MINUTE TO TELL US NUMBER.

01:52:48.294 --> 01:52:49.028
SO WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN RUNNING A

01:52:49.095 --> 01:52:50.497
PROGRAM FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS IN

01:52:50.563 --> 01:52:51.431
OUR COUNTY -- WHICH IS REALLY

01:52:51.498 --> 01:52:52.665
SIGNIFICANT A REALLY LONG TIME

01:52:52.732 --> 01:52:53.933
TO BE RUNNING A PROGRAM HALF OF

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:54.601
OUR STAFF HAS BEEN WORKING WITH

01:52:54.667 --> 01:52:55.201
US FOR MORE THAN FIVE YEARS

01:52:55.268 --> 01:52:56.636
WHICH IS WHILE CONSIDERING THAT

01:52:56.703 --> 01:52:57.570
IT'S MENTAL HEALTH IT'S

01:52:57.637 --> 01:52:59.405
COMMUNITY BASED AND IT'S CRISIS

01:52:59.472 --> 01:53:01.174
WORK -- I THINK THE BEAUTY OF

01:53:01.241 --> 01:53:02.542
OUR PROGRAM IS THAT WE'RE JUST

01:53:02.609 --> 01:53:03.910
REALLY ABLE TO SERVE.

01:53:03.977 --> 01:53:05.211
FAMILIES AT A TIME THAT'S

01:53:05.278 --> 01:53:06.980
CONVENIENT FOR THEM AT THEIR

01:53:07.046 --> 01:53:08.915
HOME ADD IN A SPACE THAT'S

01:53:08.982 --> 01:53:10.150
COMING UP FOR THEM IN THEIR

01:53:10.216 --> 01:53:12.185
LANGUAGE -- IT'S REALLY MENTAL

01:53:12.252 --> 01:53:13.353
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS RESPONDING

01:53:13.419 --> 01:53:15.054
MENTAL HEALTH CRISES -- REALLY

01:53:15.121 --> 01:53:16.322
THERE TO ADVOCATE FOR THEM AND

01:53:16.389 --> 01:53:17.423
REALLY SUPPORT THEM THROUGHOUT

01:53:17.490 --> 01:53:19.025
THAT ENTIRE PROCESS WHAT WE DO

01:53:19.092 --> 01:53:21.161
HAVE A GREAT DIVERSION RATE IT

01:53:21.227 --> 01:53:23.129
WE DON'T ALWAYS GET TO DIVERT

01:53:23.196 --> 01:53:24.797
BUT WE DO GET TO HELP -- CHANCE

01:53:24.864 --> 01:53:25.565
FOR THEM TO THE HOSPITAL BE WITH

01:53:25.632 --> 01:53:26.966
THEM THROUGHOUT THAT PROCESS AND

01:53:27.033 --> 01:53:29.369
REALLY SUPPORT THEM AND PROVIDE

01:53:29.435 --> 01:53:30.637
FOLLOW UP SERVICES IF THEY NEED

01:53:30.703 --> 01:53:32.539
ANY -- SO THE CONFLICT OVERVIEW

01:53:32.605 --> 01:53:36.376
OF WHAT WE DO -- HAPPY AND IF IF

01:53:36.442 --> 01:53:37.944
I COULD JUST ADD TO THAT TIME

01:53:38.011 --> 01:53:38.945
AND TIME AGAIN.

01:53:39.012 --> 01:53:40.847
WE IN MOST OF OUR COUNTY STACK

01:53:40.914 --> 01:53:42.782
PROVIDES PROGRAMS ACROSS THE

01:53:42.849 --> 01:53:43.016
STATE.

01:53:43.082 --> 01:53:44.784
AND MOST OF OUR CAN AS WE DON'T

01:53:44.851 --> 01:53:45.351
HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF HAVING

01:53:45.418 --> 01:53:45.885
LEVEL RESPONSE.

01:53:45.952 --> 01:53:47.020
AND SO WHAT WE SEE IS A CYCLE

01:53:47.086 --> 01:53:49.756
WHETHER WHERE EITHER POLICE OR

01:53:49.822 --> 01:53:50.323
SOMETIMES MENTAL HEALTH AND

01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:50.924
BEING.

01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:51.691
A CHILD ENDS UP IN AN EMERGENCY

01:53:51.758 --> 01:53:53.159
ROOM IN THE HOSPITAL USUALLY

01:53:53.226 --> 01:53:54.694
THOSE WAIT TIMES WHEN SOMEBODY'S

01:53:54.761 --> 01:53:57.096
IN THE KID PSYCHIATRIC CRISIS.

01:53:57.163 --> 01:53:58.965
IS OUR FOUR SIX EIGHT AT THE

01:53:59.032 --> 01:54:00.800
I'VE HEARD NIGHTMARE STORIES OF

01:54:00.867 --> 01:54:03.403
MUCH LONGER YOU KNOW THE STORIES --

01:54:03.469 --> 01:54:05.071
OFTEN ARE TEENAGERS SIMPLY WALK

01:54:05.138 --> 01:54:06.072
OUT.

01:54:06.139 --> 01:54:13.947
THEY DON'T EVEN WAIT TO GET HELP.

01:54:14.013 --> 01:54:14.747
THAT'S BEST CASE SCENARIO.

01:54:14.814 --> 01:54:15.481
WORST CASE SCENARIOS LAW

01:54:15.548 --> 01:54:16.849
ENFORCEMENT IS CALLED.

01:54:16.916 --> 01:54:18.218
THE SOMETHING HAPPENS THAT TAKES

01:54:18.284 --> 01:54:19.552
THEM DOWN THAT TRAJECTORY AND

01:54:19.619 --> 01:54:20.853
THEY'RE IN JUVENILE HALL AND

01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:22.088
THEN IN RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT OR

01:54:23.356 --> 01:54:24.891
OF AT AND AND SO MANY OF THOSE

01:54:24.958 --> 01:54:27.627
SITUATIONS ARE UNNECESSARY.

01:54:27.694 --> 01:54:29.429
SO MANY OF THE SITUATIONS WHEN

WE GET TENER BEING AT THE

01:54:30.697 --> 01:54:32.031
OPTIMAL POINT.

01:54:34.067 --> 01:54:36.669
ALLOWS US TO KEEP KIDS AT HOME

01:54:36.736 --> 01:54:39.305
OR IN A FOSTER HOME.

01:54:39.372 --> 01:54:39.906
OR IN THE COMMUNITY AND IN THE

01:54:39.973 --> 01:54:43.676

01:54:51.551 --> 01:54:53.152
A NIGHTMARE FOR THEM IS TO PICK

01:54:53.219 --> 01:54:54.554

FINANCE ARE ALEJO.

01:58:08.548 --> 01:58:09.615
I'D SAY THE GREG ROSE AGAIN FOR

01:58:09.682 --> 01:58:10.817
THE DEPARTMENT CERTAINLY WERE

01:58:10.883 --> 01:58:13.386
AWARE OF THESE TYPES OF SERVICES --

01:58:13.453 --> 01:58:15.421
AND PROGRAMS AND IN OTHER STATES

01:58:15.488 --> 01:58:17.590
AND AND IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS

01:58:17.657 --> 01:58:19.692
AND I THINK THAT THE KEY FOR US

01:58:19.759 --> 01:58:20.893
IS THAT THE KEY FOR ME WHEN I

01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:21.994
THINK ABOUT IS.

01:58:22.061 --> 01:58:24.197
HOW WE GO ABOUT HOW

01:58:24.263 --> 01:58:26.299
IMPLEMENTATION AGO ABOUT IT MANY

01:58:26.365 --> 01:58:27.266
OF THE PLACES I'M AWARE IT ARE

01:58:27.333 --> 01:58:29.202
RIGHT OUR SMALL SMALLER --

01:58:29.268 --> 01:58:33.072
JURISDICTIONS AND DO WE DO HAVE.

01:58:33.139 --> 01:58:33.940
URBAN AND RURAL AND DISTANCE AND

01:58:34.006 --> 01:58:34.974
A NUMBER OF THINGS TO CONSIDER

01:58:35.041 --> 01:58:37.376
BUT WE ARE IN FACT AWARE OF OF

01:58:37.443 --> 01:58:39.045
OF THE UTILITY OF THESE KINDS OF

01:58:39.111 --> 01:58:40.279
PROGRAMS AND WE'VE SEEN THEM IN

01:58:40.346 --> 01:58:42.248
OTHER JURISDICTIONS.

01:58:42.315 --> 01:58:44.217
AND IF I MAY THE ALLEN BEATS SO

01:58:44.283 --> 01:58:45.985
WAS ONE OF THE ENGINEERS OF THE

01:58:46.052 --> 01:58:47.453
NEW JERSEY SYSTEM WHICH IS

01:58:47.520 --> 01:58:49.222
ACTUALLY A LARGER MORE SKILLED

01:58:49.288 --> 01:58:50.823
SYSTEM AND HE WORKED.

01:58:50.890 --> 01:58:53.025
WITH US ON SOME OF THE IDEAS

01:58:53.092 --> 01:58:53.960
AROUND CONSTRUCTION OF THE

01:58:54.026 --> 01:58:57.363
SYSTEM AND HOW IT CAN BE SCALED --

01:58:57.430 --> 01:58:59.232
MOBILE RESPONSE ACTUALLY.

01:58:59.298 --> 01:59:00.366
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH IS IN A

01:59:00.433 --> 01:59:02.034
MORE COST EFFECTIVE PROGRAM AT

01:59:02.101 --> 01:59:04.537
SCALE THE THE SMALLER IT IS THE

01:59:04.604 --> 01:59:05.805
MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE YOU HAVE

01:59:05.872 --> 01:59:06.739
TO HAVE AVAILABILITY.

01:59:06.806 --> 01:59:08.808
AND AN UNUSED AVAILABILITY IS

01:59:08.875 --> 01:59:10.409
REALLY EXPENSIVE.

01:59:10.476 --> 01:59:12.144
SO SO TO THE DEGREE THAT YOU CAN

01:59:12.211 --> 01:59:14.180
HAVE DEPTH IN TEAMS TO RESPOND

01:59:14.247 --> 01:59:17.016
TO A BROADER AREA YOU DO GET.

01:59:17.083 --> 01:59:18.584
NOT JUST SMALL ECONOMIES OF

01:59:18.651 --> 01:59:20.686
SCALE BUT BIG ECONOMIES OF SCALE

01:59:20.753 --> 01:59:22.255
AROUND THE INITIAL RESPONSE

01:59:22.321 --> 01:59:23.756
ESPECIALLY SO THERE ARE SOME

01:59:23.823 --> 01:59:25.124
THINGS THAT REALLY WORK ABOUT A

01:59:25.191 --> 01:59:26.692
STATEWIDE SYSTEM THAT ARE VERY

01:59:26.759 --> 01:59:30.196
DIFFICULT IN THE SMALLER SYSTEMS

01:59:30.263 --> 01:59:32.698
THAT WE'RE RUNNING.

01:59:32.765 --> 01:59:35.201

THEM AT THIS TIME -- SO AGAIN.

01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:43.676

02:00:59.318 --> 02:01:01.287
EXEMPTION ANYMORE SO ALL THE

02:01:01.354 --> 02:01:03.289
PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE AND ALL

02:01:03.356 --> 02:01:04.090

ALL ENDS ON JUNE THIRTIETH.

02:01:06.859 --> 02:01:08.260
SAYS ADVOCATES WERE VERY

02:01:08.327 --> 02:01:09.462
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT WE WOULD

02:01:09.528 --> 02:01:11.597
ASK THE LEGISLATURE TO REALLY

02:01:11.664 --> 02:01:13.566
WHO WORK WITH US TO CONTINUE THE

02:01:13.633 --> 02:01:15.401
AMAZING WORK THAT HAPPENED. TO

02:01:15.468 --> 02:01:16.902
MAKE SURE THAT WE EXTEND TO AT

02:01:16.969 --> 02:01:18.738

02:01:19.772 --> 02:01:20.039
DAYS.

02:01:20.106 --> 02:01:21.974
BECAUSE A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS IS

02:01:22.041 --> 02:01:22.942
THE CURRENT AVERAGE.

02:01:23.009 --> 02:01:24.610
SAID ANYTHING BELOW THAT REALLY

02:01:24.677 --> 02:01:26.278
IS GOING TO PUT FAMILIES AT RISK

02:01:26.345 --> 02:01:28.047
WE ALSO REALLY ENCOURAGE THE

02:01:28.114 --> 02:01:29.248
GOOD BECAUSE EXEMPTION WOULD

02:01:29.315 --> 02:01:30.616
NEED THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME

02:01:30.683 --> 02:01:32.051
FAMILIES THAT.

02:01:32.118 --> 02:01:34.186
FOR REASONS BEYOND THEIR CONTROL

02:01:34.253 --> 02:01:35.621
IT GOES PAST THAT THEY CAN'T

02:01:35.688 --> 02:01:37.423
JUST LOSE FUNDING OVER THINGS

02:01:37.490 --> 02:01:38.991
THAT ARE NOT UNDER THEIR CONTROL.

02:01:39.058 --> 02:01:42.928
IT HARMS NOT ONLY THESE FAMILIES

02:01:42.995 --> 02:01:43.529
BUT ALSO THE CHILDREN IN THEIR

02:01:43.596 --> 02:01:45.297

PERSONALLY SEEN IT SO I I'M NOT

02:10:08.534 --> 02:10:09.134
QUALIFIED PROBABLY TO TALK ABOUT

02:10:09.201 --> 02:10:09.968
IT I WILL TELL YOU THAT SCHOOL

02:10:10.035 --> 02:10:11.670

02:10:11.737 --> 02:10:13.138
REALIGNED IN TWENTY ELEVEN TO

02:10:13.205 --> 02:10:14.907
COUNTIES SO STATE VISIBILITY

02:10:14.973 --> 02:10:16.341
INTO EXACTLY WHAT'S BEING SPENT

02:10:16.408 --> 02:10:17.276
TODAY AND HOW.

02:10:17.342 --> 02:10:19.344
MUCH A CASE COSTS IS SOMEWHAT

02:10:19.411 --> 02:10:21.880
LIMITED.

02:10:21.947 --> 02:10:23.549
JUST IMPRISONMENT FINANCE WHO I

02:10:23.615 --> 02:10:24.082
BELIEVE -- THERE'S ALSO

02:10:24.149 --> 02:10:26.285
COMPANION LEGISLATION THAT'S

02:10:26.351 --> 02:10:27.786
RELATED TO THAT SO I THINK IT'S

02:10:27.853 --> 02:10:31.056
A ASSEMBLY BILL -- THREE THREE

02:10:31.123 --> 02:10:33.325
SEVEN AND AND FINANCES -- I

02:10:33.392 --> 02:10:36.094
BELIEVE OUR ANALYSIS MIGHT BE

02:10:36.161 --> 02:10:37.729
OUT I'M NOT SURE BUT I THERE

02:10:37.796 --> 02:10:40.399
MIGHT BE SOME QUESTIONS WITH THE

02:10:40.465 --> 02:10:42.434
THE ACTUAL LAST IMMINENT -- WE

02:10:42.501 --> 02:10:44.002
HAVEN'T REALLY DUG DEEP INTO

02:10:44.069 --> 02:10:46.238
EVERYTHING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

02:10:46.305 --> 02:10:47.639
THE CASELOAD IS AND BECAUSE

02:10:47.706 --> 02:10:48.840
THERE'S A LOT OF COMPONENTS THAT

02:10:48.907 --> 02:10:50.175
GO INTO THIS SOME.

02:10:50.242 --> 02:10:52.211
OF THE WAY THE PROGRAM WORKS --

02:10:52.277 --> 02:10:53.078
FOR THOSE FAMILIES THAT ARE

02:10:53.145 --> 02:10:55.080
APPROVED IN YOUR FUNDING AMOUNT

02:10:55.147 --> 02:10:56.615
IS DEPENDENT UPON YOUR MILEAGE

02:10:56.682 --> 02:10:58.183
FROM THE HOME.

02:10:58.250 --> 02:11:02.087
OR IF -- IT'S A A MONTHLY BUS

02:11:02.154 --> 02:11:03.722
STIPEND AND SO ON SO.

02:11:03.789 --> 02:11:06.692
THE SIMPLE ANSWER FOR YOU IS --

02:11:06.758 --> 02:11:07.793
WE'RE NOT SURE IF THAT'S THE

02:11:07.859 --> 02:11:09.428
CORRECT ESTIMATE WE'RE NOT SURE

02:11:09.494 --> 02:11:11.730
IF IT'S TO HIRE IF IT'S TOO LOW --

02:11:11.797 --> 02:11:12.764
BUT THERE ARE BECAUSE THERE ARE

02:11:12.831 --> 02:11:17.603
SOME VARIABLES TO LOOK INTO ON

02:11:17.669 --> 02:11:18.737
THAT -- SO.

02:11:18.804 --> 02:11:20.072
I I WON'T SAY WHAT YOU DON'T

02:11:20.138 --> 02:11:23.175
WANT ME TO SAY -- BUT BUT WE I I

02:11:23.242 --> 02:11:24.243
I CAN DOUBLE CHECK FOR YOU AND

02:11:24.309 --> 02:11:25.010
FIND OUT OF OUR ANALYSIS IS

02:11:25.077 --> 02:11:27.679
PUBLIC RIGHT AND AND AND HOW.

02:11:27.746 --> 02:11:29.248
NOT ONLY -- IF THE ANALYSIS IS

02:11:29.314 --> 02:11:29.915
CORRECT BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO

02:11:29.982 --> 02:11:30.816
DETERMINE.

02:11:30.882 --> 02:11:34.119
IF IT IS TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW --

02:11:34.186 --> 02:11:35.654
I THOUGHT THAT WAS A A KIND OF

02:11:35.721 --> 02:11:38.290
AN ACCOUNTING TYPE OF ISSUE WELL

02:11:38.357 --> 02:11:39.324
IT'S JUST IT'S LIKE USUAL

02:11:39.391 --> 02:11:40.225
EVERYTHING IS AN ESTIMATE FOR

02:11:40.292 --> 02:11:40.892
ITS RIGHT BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW

02:11:40.959 --> 02:11:42.361
WHAT THE CASE THAT IS GOING TO

02:11:42.427 --> 02:11:43.562
BE AWARE YOUTH MAY.

02:11:43.629 --> 02:11:45.931
NOT BE PLACED -- GETS A ONE BY

02:11:45.998 --> 02:11:46.932
ONE TIME A YOUTH COULD

02:11:46.999 --> 02:11:48.267
POTENTIALLY BE PLACED. THREE

02:11:48.333 --> 02:11:50.402
MILES FROM -- THEIR SCHOOL BOARD

02:11:50.469 --> 02:11:51.703
CHEN AND THEN A NEW PLACE

02:11:51.770 --> 02:11:53.505
SPENDING GREG IF YOU WANT TO ADD

02:11:53.572 --> 02:11:54.106
ANYTHING.

02:11:54.172 --> 02:11:54.840
THEY COULD BE PLACED SOMEWHERE

02:11:54.906 --> 02:11:57.209
WHERE IT'S TEN MILES AWAY SO --

02:11:57.276 --> 02:11:59.044
WE WE DO TAKE AND ALL THOSE

02:11:59.111 --> 02:12:00.679
CONSIDERATIONS WITH WORKING WITH --

02:12:00.746 --> 02:12:02.581
THE DEPARTMENT WHEN WE TRY TO

02:12:02.648 --> 02:12:07.552
COME UP WITH THAT CEMENT SO

02:12:07.619 --> 02:12:08.820
YOU'RE CORRECT THERE'S NO.

02:12:08.887 --> 02:12:09.888
PERFECT POINT WE CAN SAY EXACTLY

02:12:09.955 --> 02:12:10.956
WHAT IT IS BUT WE NEED TO TRY TO

02:12:11.023 --> 02:12:12.090
DO OUR BEST TO TO GIVE AN

02:12:12.157 --> 02:12:13.225
ACCURATE OR A BEST ESTIMATE FOR

02:12:13.292 --> 02:12:15.060
THE LEGISLATURE WHEN WE MAKE OUR

02:12:15.127 --> 02:12:15.861
ANALYSES.

02:12:15.927 --> 02:12:16.828
REGRETS THE DEPARTMENT I JUST

02:12:16.895 --> 02:12:17.696
SAY TO HISTORICALLY WHAT WE DO

02:12:17.763 --> 02:12:19.965
WE OFTEN DO IS LOOK AT PREVIOUS

02:12:20.032 --> 02:12:21.400
EXPENDITURES FOR A SIMILAR --

02:12:21.466 --> 02:12:22.968
POPULATIONS OF THE FOR THOSE

02:12:23.035 --> 02:12:24.603
APPROVED VERSES THE OF FOLKS

02:12:24.670 --> 02:12:25.904
THAT ARE TO PROVE WE COULD LOOK

02:12:25.971 --> 02:12:27.139
WE CAN LOOK AT THOSE PREVIOUS

02:12:27.205 --> 02:12:28.040
EXPENDITURES.

02:12:28.106 --> 02:12:30.742
AS AS AS MISTER SPEAKER JUST

02:12:30.809 --> 02:12:32.944
SAID -- SOME OF THOSE BECAUSE OF

02:12:33.011 --> 02:12:34.212
REALIGNMENT THAT THE PRECISION

02:12:34.279 --> 02:12:36.615
OF THE OF KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT

02:12:36.682 --> 02:12:38.317
WAS SPENT -- IS IS A LITTLE LESS

02:12:38.383 --> 02:12:41.853
PRECISE THAN IT HAS HISTORICALLY

02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:43.021
BEEN BUT THERE ARE SOME.

02:12:43.088 --> 02:12:44.022
WAYS IN WHICH WE COULD PARTNER

02:12:44.089 --> 02:12:45.023
WITH FINANCE AND THE ADVOCATES

02:12:45.090 --> 02:12:45.924
TO KIND OF LOOK THROUGH TO ME I

02:12:45.991 --> 02:12:48.527

THAT'S YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY AN

02:12:52.431 --> 02:12:52.998
IMPORTANT PIECE TO THIS IF WE

02:12:53.065 --> 02:12:55.701
CAN'T -- PROVIDE THE THE MONEY

02:12:55.767 --> 02:12:57.536
IF WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY

02:12:57.602 --> 02:12:59.638
WE'RE GOING TO NEED FOR IT SO.

02:12:59.705 --> 02:13:00.572
THAT OUR FAMILY FOUNDER COUNTIES

02:13:00.639 --> 02:13:01.440

02:13:01.506 --> 02:13:02.974
DATA OR SURVEY IN A COUPLE

02:13:03.041 --> 02:13:05.277
SELECT COUNTIES FOR US TO HELP

02:13:05.344 --> 02:13:08.113
ENABLE THOSE ESTIMATES.

02:13:08.180 --> 02:13:10.082

INSTEAD OF LARGELY SERVING

SMALL BUT LARGELY INVISIBLE

02:30:57.648 --> 02:30:59.150
GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE THESE ARE

02:30:59.216 --> 02:31:01.585
YOUNG PEOPLE AGED EIGHTEEN TO

EXTENDED FOSTER CARE.

02:31:03.921 --> 02:31:05.389
THIS IS A GROUP THAT WE WE VERY

02:31:05.456 --> 02:31:09.193
RARELY SPEAK OF AND UTILIZE

02:31:09.260 --> 02:31:10.127
TEACH PEOPLE IT'S CONSIDERABLY.

02:31:10.194 --> 02:31:11.662
THIS PROGRAM IS BEEN EVALUATED

02:31:11.729 --> 02:31:13.097
EVERY YEAR SINCE.

02:31:13.164 --> 02:31:13.931
TWO THOUSAND SIX A CONSISTENTLY

02:31:13.998 --> 02:31:15.833
FOUND TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR

02:31:15.900 --> 02:31:17.668
YOUTH NOTABLY IN AREAS OF

02:31:17.735 --> 02:31:19.403

EARNINGS AND EMPLOYMENT.

02:31:20.604 --> 02:31:22.440
SO CLEARLY THIS IS A WELL

02:31:22.506 --> 02:31:24.008
ESTABLISHED EFFECTIVE STATE

02:31:24.074 --> 02:31:25.376
PROGRAM.

02:31:25.443 --> 02:31:27.044
HOWEVER IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN

02:31:27.111 --> 02:31:29.380
THIS PROGRAM IS AT RISK.

02:31:29.447 --> 02:31:30.381
THE STATE BUDGET FOR TEACH

02:31:30.448 --> 02:31:31.215
PEOPLE PLUS HAS REMAINED

02:31:31.282 --> 02:31:34.385
UNCHANGED SINCE.

02:31:34.452 --> 02:31:34.985
TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN DURING THE

02:31:35.052 --> 02:31:36.620
SAME SENSE THAT SAME PERIOD OF

02:31:36.687 --> 02:31:37.721
TIME THE COST OF HOUSING

02:31:37.788 --> 02:31:38.989
CALIFORNIA.

02:31:39.056 --> 02:31:41.525
HAS INCREASED BY 50%.

02:31:41.592 --> 02:31:43.594
SO NOT SURPRISINGLY AS THE

02:31:43.661 --> 02:31:44.628
DEMAND FOR HOUSING HAS

02:31:44.695 --> 02:31:47.298
SKYROCKETED SO HAS DEMAND FOR

02:31:47.364 --> 02:31:48.766
THIS VITAL SAFETY NET PROGRAM.

02:31:48.833 --> 02:31:50.868
WE DID A MOMENT IN TIME SNAPSHOT

02:31:50.935 --> 02:31:53.737
IN A AND IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND

02:31:53.804 --> 02:31:54.872
EIGHTEEN THERE WERE OVER FOUR

02:31:54.939 --> 02:31:55.906
HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN ELIGIBLE

02:31:55.973 --> 02:31:57.508

02:31:58.676 --> 02:31:59.977
LOS ANGELES AND SAN DIEGO

02:32:00.044 --> 02:32:01.745
COUNTIES EACH HAD A WAITING LIST

02:32:01.812 --> 02:32:03.848
OF OUR FIFTY YOUNG PEOPLE AGAIN

02:32:03.914 --> 02:32:05.716
OVER HALF OF WHO ARE CUSTODIAL

02:32:05.783 --> 02:32:06.817
PARENTS.

02:32:06.884 --> 02:32:08.352
THESE ARE FORMER FOSTER YOUTH

02:32:08.419 --> 02:32:11.222
WHO WERE IN CARE UNTIL AGE.

02:32:11.288 --> 02:32:11.922
EIGHTEEN WE'RE NOT ABLE TO

02:32:11.989 --> 02:32:14.625
ACHIEVE PERMANENCE AND NOW FIND

02:32:14.692 --> 02:32:16.894

SEVERAL YEARS AFTER HOMELESS.

02:32:18.195 --> 02:32:19.363
SO THE CURRENT BUDGET PROPOSAL

02:32:19.430 --> 02:32:20.764
IS AN EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR

THE SUPPORT I CURRENTLY HAVE I

02:52:00.743 --> 02:52:01.878
BELIEVE THAT I WOULD BE LIVING

02:52:01.944 --> 02:52:03.312
IN A CAR OR WORSE.

02:52:03.379 --> 02:52:05.114
I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

02:52:05.181 --> 02:52:06.449
CONTINUE SCHOOL AND I KNOW I

02:52:06.516 --> 02:52:08.317
WOULD HAVE LOST ALL MOTIVATION

02:52:08.384 --> 02:52:08.918
TO WORK.

02:52:08.985 --> 02:52:10.186
I AM SURE THAT COLLEGE WOULD NOT

02:52:10.253 --> 02:52:11.688
EVEN BE ON MY MIND.

02:52:11.754 --> 02:52:12.989

FIXES FOR EXTENDED FOSTER CARE.

02:52:46.055 --> 02:52:47.190

YOUNG PEOPLE WHO COME IN AT AGE.

02:52:50.259 --> 02:52:51.294

FEATURING A WHAT THE DEPARTMENT --

02:54:52.315 --> 02:54:53.449
I I THINK AS HAS BEEN POINTED

02:54:53.516 --> 02:54:54.383
OUT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN

02:54:54.450 --> 02:54:56.219
I I THOUGHT IT WAS TWO YEARS NOT

02:54:56.285 --> 02:54:57.653
THREE UNDER DISCUSSION -- I

02:54:57.720 --> 02:54:58.821
THINK THERE'S BEEN SOME BACK AND

02:54:58.888 --> 02:55:00.523
FORTH THERE I'M NOT PERSONALLY

02:55:00.590 --> 02:55:02.158
FAMILIAR WITH THAT SO I I'M NOT

02:55:02.225 --> 02:55:03.626
SURE WHAT THE STATUS OF THOSE

02:55:03.693 --> 02:55:06.028
CONVERSATIONS ARE.

02:55:06.095 --> 02:55:07.530
THE STAFF IS YEAH GREG ROSE THE

02:55:07.597 --> 02:55:08.331
DEPARTMENT WE'VE BEEN WE HAVE

02:55:08.397 --> 02:55:09.632
BEEN WORKING WITH THE ASSEMBLY

02:55:09.699 --> 02:55:12.101
MEMBER GIPSON STAFF AND OTHER

02:55:12.168 --> 02:55:15.238
ADVOCATES -- WE GET THAT THE

02:55:15.304 --> 02:55:17.139
NUMBERS THAT THE NUMBERS SHOULD

02:55:17.206 --> 02:55:19.842
BE AVAILABLE RELATIVELY SOON IT

02:55:19.909 --> 02:55:21.077
WE BUT WHAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING

02:55:21.143 --> 02:55:22.678
AT WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR SOME

02:55:22.745 --> 02:55:24.480
ACTUAL LANGUAGE TOOK TOOK TAKE A

02:55:24.547 --> 02:55:26.415
LOOK AT SO THAT WE CAN -- SEE IN

02:55:26.482 --> 02:55:31.120
FACT IF THE IF THE THAT THAT

02:55:31.187 --> 02:55:32.121
THAT THE NARROWNESS THAT THAT

02:55:32.188 --> 02:55:32.955
HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS

02:55:33.022 --> 02:55:36.158
ARTICULATED THERE AS WELL -- ARE

02:55:36.225 --> 02:55:36.692
ARE ARE.

02:55:36.759 --> 02:55:37.894
CLEARLY WE AREN'T INTERESTED WE

02:55:37.960 --> 02:55:39.228
ARE WE ARE INTERESTED IN NOT

02:55:39.295 --> 02:55:40.963
HAVING YOUNG PEOPLE FALL THROUGH

02:55:41.030 --> 02:55:43.132
THE CRACKS BECAUSE OF SOME KIND

02:55:43.199 --> 02:55:45.101
OF YOU KNOW DELAY IN COURT OR

02:55:45.167 --> 02:55:51.874
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS -- THE THE

02:55:51.941 --> 02:55:53.009
NUMBER THAT WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN

02:55:53.075 --> 02:55:54.443
AND BECAUSE WE DON'T A WE HAVE A

02:55:54.510 --> 02:55:55.544
HARD TIME ACTUALLY VERIFYING

02:55:55.611 --> 02:55:57.847
THEM -- ARE IN FACT VERY SMALL

02:55:57.914 --> 02:55:59.415
SO -- I WE WE WERE WAITING ON

02:55:59.482 --> 02:56:00.249
SOME LANGUAGE AND WE ARE GOING

02:56:00.316 --> 02:56:00.917
TO FINISH CRUNCH IN SOME NUMBERS

02:56:00.983 --> 02:56:02.118
AND AND AND PRIVATE PROVIDING

02:56:02.184 --> 02:56:04.453
THAT BACK TO THE TO THE THE

02:56:04.520 --> 02:56:06.923
ADVOCATES. TO THE THE EARLIEST

02:56:06.989 --> 02:56:08.925
WE CAN GET THE UPDATED CASELOAD

02:56:08.991 --> 02:56:10.893
NUMBERS.

02:56:10.960 --> 02:56:13.129
RETHINKING A MONTH.

02:56:13.195 --> 02:56:14.263
LESS -- LESS LESS THAN LESS THAN

02:56:14.330 --> 02:56:14.897
A MONTH I MEAN WE'RE BASED ON

02:56:14.964 --> 02:56:16.098
THAT THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

02:56:16.165 --> 02:56:17.500
THAT THEY'VE ASKED FOR WE SHOULD

02:56:17.566 --> 02:56:19.302
BE ABLE TO ONCE WE HAVE THE THE

02:56:19.368 --> 02:56:21.170
THE THE THAT THAT LANGUAGE BE

02:56:21.237 --> 02:56:23.906
ABLE TO TO VERIFY IT TO TO COME

02:56:23.973 --> 02:56:26.309
UP WITH SOME.

02:56:26.375 --> 02:56:28.611
NUMBER -- AND THEN IT HAS TO BE

02:56:28.678 --> 02:56:29.979
PART OF THE OVERALL BUDGET

02:56:30.046 --> 02:56:30.846
PROCESS.

02:56:30.913 --> 02:56:32.348
TO RECONCILE EVERYTHING BUT

02:56:32.415 --> 02:56:34.216
CERTAINLY WE CAN DO THAT.

02:56:34.283 --> 02:56:35.451
IT REALLY APPEARS LIKE A

02:56:35.518 --> 02:56:38.955
BUREAUCRATIC ISSUE YES -- I I

02:56:39.021 --> 02:56:41.190
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE

02:56:41.257 --> 02:56:42.558
DAHLE SUPPORTING THIS.

02:56:42.625 --> 02:56:43.893
BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT ONCE WE

02:56:43.960 --> 02:56:45.294
HAVE THE NUMBERS AND PERHAPS

02:56:45.361 --> 02:56:46.462
WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE.

02:56:46.529 --> 02:56:48.364
IS THERE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE

02:56:48.431 --> 02:56:50.166
THAT THE NUMBER.

02:56:50.232 --> 02:56:53.169
IS LARGER THAN THE CASE THAT THE

02:56:53.235 --> 02:56:54.470
CASELOAD THAT THE LA -- HAS

02:56:54.537 --> 02:56:58.774
ESTIMATED.

02:56:58.841 --> 02:57:00.509
I THINK THAT WE I DON'T I DON'T

02:57:00.576 --> 02:57:02.311
BELIEVE WE HAVE ANY INFORMATION

02:57:02.378 --> 02:57:04.347
THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT THAN THE

02:57:04.413 --> 02:57:07.717
LA -- TESTAMENT [inaudible]

02:57:07.783 --> 02:57:08.851
THE END.

02:57:08.918 --> 02:57:11.087
FINALLY I THINK THIS IS

02:57:11.153 --> 02:57:12.421
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IS

02:57:12.488 --> 02:57:14.590
CONSIDERING.

02:57:14.657 --> 02:57:17.059
THAT THIS IS A RELATIVELY SMALL

02:57:17.126 --> 02:57:19.795
GROUP WAS THE SMALL NUMBER -- IN

02:57:19.862 --> 02:57:21.931
DESPERATE CIRCUMSTANCES I THINK

02:57:21.998 --> 02:57:24.500
THAT THAT IS CLEAR AND ALSO FROM

02:57:24.567 --> 02:57:28.037
ASSEMBLYMEMBER GIBSON'S --

02:57:28.104 --> 02:57:30.573
TESTIMONY OF THROUGH NO FAULT OF

02:57:30.639 --> 02:57:31.807
THEIR OWN.

02:57:31.874 --> 02:57:37.413
THAT IS CLEAR -- ARE THERE ANY

02:57:37.480 --> 02:57:39.648
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT.

02:57:39.715 --> 02:57:41.650
DO NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AS A

02:57:41.717 --> 02:57:47.323
RESULT OF AS A RESULT OF THIS.

02:57:47.390 --> 02:57:48.958
AGAIN I THINK IT WILL BE ONLY

02:57:49.025 --> 02:57:51.227
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE -- THAT I

02:57:51.293 --> 02:57:54.430
COULD IMAGINE IS -- IS IF THERE

02:57:54.497 --> 02:57:56.866
ARE SOME IF THE THE L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G THE&lt;/c&gt;

02:57:56.932 --> 02:57:58.734
LANGUAGE THAT WOULD -- THAT IS

02:57:58.801 --> 02:58:01.470
BEING CLARIFIED SOMEHOW HAS A

02:58:01.537 --> 02:58:04.040
HAS HAS AN OPENING IN IT THAT

02:58:04.106 --> 02:58:07.276
WHERE THAT IS IS IN IS DIFFERENT

02:58:07.343 --> 02:58:08.177
THAN WHAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED

02:58:08.244 --> 02:58:09.745
MADE BUT I'M WAITING TO ACTUALLY

02:58:09.812 --> 02:58:12.915
SEE THE THE SPECIFIC THE THE

02:58:12.982 --> 02:58:13.849
SPECIFIC LANGUAGE OTHERWISE.

02:58:13.916 --> 02:58:15.451
ANY ENDED THE ONLY UNINTENDED

02:58:15.518 --> 02:58:17.520
CONSEQUENCES COULD BE DOES DOES

02:58:17.586 --> 02:58:19.055
THAT IS THERE ANY KIND OF

02:58:19.121 --> 02:58:21.023
PERVERSE INCENTIVE FOR FAMILIES

02:58:21.090 --> 02:58:23.259
TO NOT DO THE RIGHT THING AND

02:58:23.325 --> 02:58:25.828
HAVE THEIR YOUNG PEOPLE AND UP --

02:58:25.895 --> 02:58:27.329
IT IN EXTENDED FOSTER CARE

02:58:27.396 --> 02:58:29.331
THERE'S BEEN -- THERE HAVE BEEN

02:58:29.398 --> 02:58:31.400
OTHER STATES WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE

02:58:31.467 --> 02:58:33.769
THAT -- NOT IN THIS SPECIFIC

02:58:33.836 --> 02:58:35.271
INCH IS INSTANCE BUT THAT WOULD

02:58:35.337 --> 02:58:36.138
BE THE ONLY THING I WOULD SAY WE

02:58:36.205 --> 02:58:37.840
HAVE TO GUARD WE WOULD WANT TO

JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM.

03:05:20.008 --> 03:05:21.043
THE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE

03:05:21.109 --> 03:05:23.145
INITIAL FUNDS IS WELL ON ITS WAY

03:05:23.212 --> 03:05:24.680
WITH CDS WITH THE APARTMENT OF

03:05:24.746 --> 03:05:26.982

03:05:28.617 --> 03:05:29.918
AND TO DISTRIBUTE THOSE FUNDS

03:05:29.985 --> 03:05:31.119
CONDUCTED THROUGH A WEAPON ARE

03:05:31.186 --> 03:05:32.588

03:05:40.062 --> 03:05:41.497
UNFORTUNATELY THAT INITIAL

ALLOCATION WILL ONLY COVER ABOUT

03:05:44.733 --> 03:05:46.368

SEVENTEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT

03:06:03.018 --> 03:06:04.720

03:06:04.786 --> 03:06:06.021
IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CALLS TO

03:06:06.088 --> 03:06:07.055

03:07:41.483 --> 03:07:42.584
OBVIOUSLY REDUCING THE

03:07:42.651 --> 03:07:43.952
CRIMINALIZATION OF YOUTH AND

03:07:44.019 --> 03:07:46.121
THEIR BEHAVIORS IS A GOOD THING

03:07:46.188 --> 03:07:48.023
WE WENT ALL SUPPORT THAT -- I I

03:07:48.090 --> 03:07:49.291
WOULD SAY IT'S PROBABLY TOO

03:07:49.358 --> 03:07:50.392
EARLY TO TELL WHETHER THE MONEY

03:07:50.459 --> 03:07:51.360
THAT WAS IN THE CURRENT YEAR

03:07:51.426 --> 03:07:53.328
BUDGET IS HAVING AN IMPACT OR

03:07:53.395 --> 03:07:55.130
THE IMPACT THAT WAS INTENDED OF

03:07:55.197 --> 03:07:55.530
IT.

03:07:55.597 --> 03:07:56.732
THE COMMENT THAT I'VE MADE

03:07:56.798 --> 03:07:58.266
PREVIOUSLY ABOUT YOU KNOW WHEN

03:07:58.333 --> 03:07:59.701
WE MAKE AN INVESTMENT WHAT ARE

03:07:59.768 --> 03:08:02.170
WE GETTING FOR IT WHAT WE EXPECT

03:08:02.237 --> 03:08:03.138
TO SEE FOR IT.

03:08:03.205 --> 03:08:05.040
PER SHARE THE CLARIFICATION THIS

03:08:05.107 --> 03:08:06.508
IS A ONE TIME REQUEST.

03:08:06.575 --> 03:08:07.909
THAT COMES ALONG WITH SOME

03:08:07.976 --> 03:08:09.244
CONCERNS ABOUT STARTING

03:08:09.311 --> 03:08:10.646
SOMETHING AND THEN STOPPING

03:08:10.712 --> 03:08:13.348
SOMETHING OR WHAT COMES NEXT AS

03:08:13.415 --> 03:08:14.983
THE NEXT STOP FOR THESE

03:08:15.050 --> 03:08:16.652
PROVIDERS AS THEY EXPAND THE

03:08:16.718 --> 03:08:17.519
CAPACITY.

03:08:17.586 --> 03:08:19.755
UP SO AGAIN COMING BACK TO THE

03:08:19.821 --> 03:08:21.790
HOW DO WE PROVE THAT IT WORKS SO

03:08:21.857 --> 03:08:22.658
THAT WE KNOW WHETHER WE WANT TO

03:08:22.724 --> 03:08:24.793
CONTINUE IN THE FUTURE OR NOT.

03:08:24.860 --> 03:08:26.261
SO THOSE WOULD BE SOME KINDS OF

03:08:26.328 --> 03:08:27.763
THE QUESTIONS I WOULD

03:08:27.829 --> 03:08:30.232
ADDITIONALLY NOTE -- AND COULD

03:08:30.298 --> 03:08:31.333
PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE DONE IT

03:08:31.400 --> 03:08:33.168
EARLIER THERE'S A LOT OF OVERLAP

03:08:33.235 --> 03:08:35.203
IN THE ADDRESSING OF THE ISSUES

03:08:35.270 --> 03:08:36.972
BETWEEN THE VARIOUS PROPOSALS

03:08:37.039 --> 03:08:38.707
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY.

03:08:38.774 --> 03:08:40.709
YOU HEARD THP PLUS TALK ABOUT

03:08:40.776 --> 03:08:43.178
BAD CAPACITY AN INCREASE IN THE

03:08:43.245 --> 03:08:44.546
NUMBER OF BEDS AVAILABLE.

03:08:44.613 --> 03:08:46.882
THEN WE HEARD A PROPOSAL ABOUT --

03:08:46.948 --> 03:08:48.850
AT ADVOCATING FOR NAVIGATORS TO

03:08:48.917 --> 03:08:51.520
HELP PEOPLE FIND PLACES TO STAY

03:08:51.586 --> 03:08:52.320
HERE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:08:52.387 --> 03:08:53.955
HELPING THEM ACHIEVE PERMANENCY

03:08:54.022 --> 03:08:55.157
WHEN THEY'RE ALREADY IN A

03:08:55.223 --> 03:08:57.359
CONGREGATE CARE SITUATION.

03:08:57.426 --> 03:08:59.161
AND DIVERTING THEM FROM CRIMINAL

03:08:59.227 --> 03:09:00.629
JUSTICE SO THERE'S A CERTAIN

03:09:00.696 --> 03:09:02.898
PIECE TO THAT WE WOULD LIKE A

03:09:02.964 --> 03:09:04.332
PART IN THE CONVERSATION NOT

03:09:04.399 --> 03:09:05.534
JUST WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO

03:09:05.600 --> 03:09:06.835
ACHIEVE IN ARE WE GETTING AT BUT

03:09:06.902 --> 03:09:07.969
ALSO HOW DO THESE THINGS

03:09:08.036 --> 03:09:09.471
INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER SO IT'S

03:09:09.538 --> 03:09:15.410
A MORE COMPLICATED CONVERSATION.

03:09:15.477 --> 03:09:16.178
VALID ISSUE AND AGAIN FIRST

03:09:16.244 --> 03:09:17.112
THING I SAID REDUCING THE

03:09:17.179 --> 03:09:17.713
CRIMINALIZATION OF YOUTH AND

03:09:17.779 --> 03:09:19.147
THEIR BEHAVIORS IS A REALLY

03:09:19.214 --> 03:09:19.715
IMPORTANT HUMAN THING TO BE

03:09:19.781 --> 03:09:23.585
DOING.

03:09:23.652 --> 03:09:25.654
BERMAN FINANCE -- ARE JUST

03:09:25.721 --> 03:09:26.755
INTEREST FROM FINANCE ANSWERED

03:09:26.822 --> 03:09:27.689
LIKE THAT ON THE ADMINISTRATION

03:09:27.756 --> 03:09:28.690
HAS TAKEN SOME APPROACHES ON

03:09:28.757 --> 03:09:29.825
THIS I BELIEVE -- REGULATIONS

03:09:29.891 --> 03:09:30.759
WERE JUST FINALIZED IN OCTOBER

03:09:30.826 --> 03:09:32.861
OF LAST YEAR TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE

03:09:32.928 --> 03:09:35.363
IN AND IT WITH -- A LOT OF THESE

03:09:35.430 --> 03:09:37.599
FACILITIES ON ADDRESS SCENE --

03:09:37.666 --> 03:09:38.934
PICTURED COULD END IN AN EFFORT

03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:40.635
TO LIMIT THE NEED FOR CALLING

03:09:40.702 --> 03:09:44.673
LAW ENFORCEMENT SO I JUST WANT

03:09:44.740 --> 03:09:46.074
TO ADD THAT ON THERE.

03:09:46.141 --> 03:09:46.641
THANK YOU AND I THINK YOU'RE

03:09:46.708 --> 03:09:47.709
CORRECTIVE PARENTS AREN'T GOING

03:09:47.776 --> 03:09:48.243
TO CALL.

03:09:48.310 --> 03:09:49.578
POLICE LAW ENFORCEMENT TO COME

03:09:49.644 --> 03:09:49.911
AND HELP THEM.

03:09:49.978 --> 03:09:51.680
OUT.

03:09:51.747 --> 03:09:53.215
SOLVE ISSUES THAT YOU'RE RIGHT

03:09:53.281 --> 03:09:56.084
THIS THE USER TEENS AND THEY'RE

03:09:56.151 --> 03:09:58.153
ACTING OUT AND BUT ONCE THEY'RE

03:09:58.220 --> 03:10:01.423
CRIMINALIZE ONCE THEY ARE PUT

03:10:01.490 --> 03:10:02.724
INTO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.

03:10:02.791 --> 03:10:04.426
THEN IT'S SO HARD TO GET THEM

03:10:04.493 --> 03:10:06.128
OUT BECAUSE THAT REMAINS WITH

03:10:06.194 --> 03:10:07.095
THEM.

03:10:07.162 --> 03:10:08.330
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING

03:10:08.396 --> 03:10:10.532

TWO THOUSAND NINE WE SAW A

03:11:38.153 --> 03:11:39.454
SLIGHT INCREASE OUR THREE YEARS

03:11:39.521 --> 03:11:40.989
AGO.

03:11:41.056 --> 03:11:42.858
BUT NOTHING CLOSE ENOUGH TO

03:11:42.924 --> 03:11:43.859
COVER THE COST OF INCREASING

03:11:43.925 --> 03:11:45.327
SOCIAL WORKER SALARIES.

03:11:45.393 --> 03:11:47.128
I THINK YOU KNOW WE ALL AGREE

03:11:47.195 --> 03:11:48.463

DOUBLE THE MINIMUM WAGE.

03:12:01.843 --> 03:12:03.111
WHILE THE MINIMUM WAGE ACT

03:12:03.178 --> 03:12:05.814
MANDATES ANNUAL INCREASES TO THE

03:12:05.881 --> 03:12:07.682
STATE'S MINIMUM WEIGHT.

03:12:07.749 --> 03:12:09.551
FFA RAID DID NOT COVER THE COST

03:12:09.618 --> 03:12:11.186
OF PAYING OUR SOCIAL WORKERS

03:12:11.253 --> 03:12:13.521
DOUBLE THAT MINIMUM WAGE.

03:12:13.588 --> 03:12:15.123

03:18:11.512 --> 03:18:12.180
INTO.

03:18:12.247 --> 03:18:14.215
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT THE CHILD

03:18:14.282 --> 03:18:16.284
WAS ALSO MONITOR BY DOCTOR EVERY

03:18:16.351 --> 03:18:18.353
TEN MINUTES DUE TO THE CRITICAL

03:18:18.419 --> 03:18:20.188
ILLNESS OF THE CHILD THE CHILD

03:18:20.255 --> 03:18:21.489
HAD MULTIPLE BACTERIAL.

03:18:21.556 --> 03:18:22.724
DIFFERENT TYPES OF INFECTION

03:18:22.790 --> 03:18:24.058
AROUND THE TRACK AND IN THE

03:18:24.125 --> 03:18:25.960
TRICK AND THE DOCTORS THAT THE

03:18:26.027 --> 03:18:28.129
POINT TOLD ME THAT I SAY THAT

03:18:28.196 --> 03:18:29.163
CHILD'S LIFE.

03:18:29.230 --> 03:18:30.898
ANOTHER STORY I WANT TO MENTION

03:18:30.965 --> 03:18:32.767
IS THAT I HAVE A FOURTEEN YEAR

03:18:32.834 --> 03:18:33.868
OLD ON CONTROL DIABETIC.

03:18:33.935 --> 03:18:35.503
TYPE ONE WHICH MEANS THAT THEIR

03:18:35.570 --> 03:18:36.904
INSULIN DEPENDENT.

03:18:36.971 --> 03:18:38.373
OF THE SOCIAL WORKER NOTIFIED ME

03:18:38.439 --> 03:18:40.241
THAT THE SCHOOL SAID THAT THE

03:18:40.308 --> 03:18:42.043
CHILD'S BLOOD SUGAR WAS FIVE

03:18:42.110 --> 03:18:42.710
HUNDRED I ASKED THE SOCIAL WORK

03:18:42.777 --> 03:18:44.112
AND TAKE THE CHILD TO EMERGENCY

03:18:44.178 --> 03:18:45.446
ROOM TO HAVE THAT MEDICAL

03:18:45.513 --> 03:18:46.614
ASSESSMENT.

03:18:46.681 --> 03:18:48.149
DUE TO I HEARD ABOUT THE PAIR'S

03:18:48.216 --> 03:18:50.118
NOT COMPLIANCE AND UNSUPERVISED

03:18:50.184 --> 03:18:51.753
IN SUBDIVISION OF THE CHILD.

03:18:51.819 --> 03:18:53.054
ALSO I DID COMPLETED THE JOY

03:18:53.121 --> 03:18:55.523
HOME VISIT THAT SAME WEEK I WAS

03:18:55.590 --> 03:18:57.892
ABLE TO ASSESS THE FAMILIES NEED

03:18:57.959 --> 03:18:59.761
SAW THAT THERE WAS SOME EMOTION

03:18:59.827 --> 03:19:01.396
THE SO THEY NEED TO BE CONNECTED

03:19:01.462 --> 03:19:02.563
TO MENTAL HEALTH.

03:19:02.630 --> 03:19:04.065
MOM WAS CRYING AND STRUGGLING

03:19:04.132 --> 03:19:10.905
WITH THE TEEN TEEN ALSO

03:19:10.972 --> 03:19:11.906
STRUGGLING.

03:19:11.973 --> 03:19:12.974
SO I WAS ABLE TO CONNECT THEM

03:19:13.041 --> 03:19:14.075
ALSO I WAS ABLE TO LOOK AT THE

03:19:14.142 --> 03:19:15.910
THE METER FOR THE BLOOD SUGARS

03:19:15.977 --> 03:19:17.111
AND NOTICED THAT THE CHILD HAD.

03:19:17.178 --> 03:19:17.745
SEVERE HIGHS CONTINUOUSLY FROM

03:19:17.812 --> 03:19:19.914
MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED TO

03:19:19.981 --> 03:19:20.515
SIXTEEN HUNDRED CELLS ABLE TO

03:19:20.581 --> 03:19:21.949
SHOW THAT THAT FAMILY THAT IF

03:19:22.016 --> 03:19:23.718
THEY GO ON CHECK AT THE INSULIN

03:19:23.785 --> 03:19:25.286
IF THE BLOOD SUGAR IS UNCHECKED

03:19:25.353 --> 03:19:26.454
AND NOT COVER.

03:19:26.521 --> 03:19:27.722
THE NO CHILD THE BLOOD SUGAR

03:19:27.789 --> 03:19:29.390
WILL KEEP GOING UP IN THE CHAO

03:19:29.457 --> 03:19:30.625
COULD POSSIBLY DIE.

03:19:30.692 --> 03:19:32.627
SO WHAT DO TO MY DILIGENCE I

03:19:32.694 --> 03:19:35.029
RECOMMENDED THAT THE FAMILY ALSO

03:19:35.096 --> 03:19:37.365
GO BACK INTO THE ENDOCRINOLOGIST

03:19:37.432 --> 03:19:39.667
TO BE RETESTED ON HOW TO MANAGE

03:19:39.734 --> 03:19:42.036
THE DIABETES REGIMENT WHICH IS

03:19:42.103 --> 03:19:43.905
STILL SO IMPORTANT.

03:19:43.971 --> 03:19:46.908
ALSO OF THAT IMPACT IF WE WERE

03:19:46.974 --> 03:19:49.777
IF I WAS ABLE TO GO IN SOONER.

03:19:49.844 --> 03:19:51.679
LIKE THE ONE WITH THE TRICK

03:19:51.746 --> 03:19:53.081
THEY'RE NOT PREVENTED THE CHILD

03:19:53.147 --> 03:19:55.083
FROM BEING DETAINED AND KEPT THE

03:19:55.149 --> 03:19:56.651
CHILD IN THE HOME WITH THE

03:19:56.718 --> 03:19:58.052
DIABETIC PATIENTS.

03:19:58.119 --> 03:19:59.620
I WAS ABLE TO SO FAR KEEP THE

03:19:59.687 --> 03:20:01.255
CHILD IN THE HOME DUE TO THE

03:20:01.322 --> 03:20:02.957
SERVICE CONNECTIONS AND THEN

03:20:03.024 --> 03:20:05.827
ALSO TO DO A FOLLOW UP VISIT. TO

03:20:05.893 --> 03:20:07.228
MAKE SURE EVERYTHING THAT I HAD

03:20:07.295 --> 03:20:08.629
SUGGESTED IN RECOMMENDED THAT IS

03:20:08.696 --> 03:20:10.431
IN PLACE AND THAT THEY ARE

03:20:10.498 --> 03:20:11.532

03:20:14.736 --> 03:20:18.740
WILL MAKE THAT DETERMINATION AT

03:20:18.806 --> 03:20:21.309
THAT TIME. TO PREVENT THE CHILD

03:20:21.376 --> 03:20:22.276
FROM BEING REMOVED FROM THE HOME

03:20:22.343 --> 03:20:22.844
WE LIKE TO KEEP THE FAMILIES

03:20:22.910 --> 03:20:23.111
TOGETHER.

03:20:23.177 --> 03:20:24.145
SO PROVIDING THE APPROPRIATE

WE TALKING TO THE FOSTER YOUTH

03:21:47.295 --> 03:21:48.529
THAT'S IMPORTANT OVER TALKING TO

03:21:48.596 --> 03:21:49.363
PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY DOING

03:21:49.430 --> 03:21:51.199

QUESTIONS Y. LA COUNTY WHY SO

03:21:57.972 --> 03:21:59.173

OF ALL THE CASELOAD FOR THE

03:22:03.978 --> 03:22:04.979
STATE OF CALLAHAN'S A LITTLE BIT

03:22:05.046 --> 03:22:06.747
THERE'S SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND

03:22:06.814 --> 03:22:08.583
FOSTER YOUTH IN CALIFORNIA ALONE

03:22:08.649 --> 03:22:11.118
AND LA COUNTY HAS.

03:22:11.185 --> 03:22:12.053
TWENTY THOUSAND SO WE'RE HUGE

03:22:12.119 --> 03:22:13.488
COUNTY YES YOU ARE -- IF WE

03:22:13.554 --> 03:22:17.191
COULD GET THE PILOT GOING IN AND

03:22:17.258 --> 03:22:18.292

ONLY DISCREDIT STATEWIDE

03:22:23.097 --> 03:22:25.700
ABSOLUTE ALL RIGHT.

03:22:25.766 --> 03:22:26.934
ALL RIGHT SEVEN GET OR OR LOOK

03:22:27.001 --> 03:22:29.570
AT SOME TYPE OF PILOT PROGRAM --

03:22:29.637 --> 03:22:32.106
IN BOTH AREAS I THINK ON A ON A

03:22:32.173 --> 03:22:34.609
DIFFERENT SCALES.

03:22:34.675 --> 03:22:37.845
SINCE WE'RE THE ONLY ONES LEFT.

03:22:37.912 --> 03:22:40.047
RIGHT NOW YEAH YOU KNOW.

03:22:40.114 --> 03:22:41.582
YOU KNOW COUNTY REMAINS THE

03:22:41.649 --> 03:22:42.984
LARGEST COUNTY WITH WITH THE

03:22:43.050 --> 03:22:43.851
GREAT GREAT NEED THIS OVERLOOKED

03:22:43.918 --> 03:22:44.519
ALSO COUNTY AND WE HAVE MULTIPLE

03:22:44.585 --> 03:22:45.586
COMPLEXES BECAUSE WE HAVE THE

03:22:45.653 --> 03:22:46.988
SOCIAL ECONOMICS AND ALSO

03:22:47.054 --> 03:22:47.488
THEY'RE NOT.

03:22:47.555 --> 03:22:49.156
ALWAYS EDUCATED A LOT ON THE

03:22:49.223 --> 03:22:50.725
BELOW SIX GRADE LEVEL SO THERE'S

03:22:50.791 --> 03:22:53.160
A LOT OF EXTRA THINGS THAT WE

03:22:53.227 --> 03:22:53.794
HAD TO DO AN AUDIT TAKE CARE OF

03:22:53.861 --> 03:22:55.229
OUR ANOTHER REASON WHY SHOULD BE

03:22:55.296 --> 03:22:58.666
A PILOT PROGRAM IN BOTH COUNTIES.

03:22:58.733 --> 03:23:00.801
IS BECAUSE A LOT OF THE MEMBERS

03:23:00.868 --> 03:23:03.104
AND CLIENTS TO DO -- TRAVEL ON

03:23:03.170 --> 03:23:04.739
BECAUSE IT'S SO CLOSE FROM LA

03:23:04.805 --> 03:23:05.673
COUNTY IN DECEMBER YOU KNOW

03:23:05.740 --> 03:23:07.375
COUNTY SO IT COULD BE SERVING

03:23:07.441 --> 03:23:09.210
THE SAME FOLDED STARED JUST A A

03:23:09.277 --> 03:23:10.344
FOOD FOR THOUGHT.

03:23:10.411 --> 03:23:11.412
AND IF WE KEEP TALKING WILL

03:23:11.479 --> 03:23:12.613
DAVID GIVE YOU EVER REASON

03:23:12.680 --> 03:23:13.781
POSSIBLE.

03:23:13.848 --> 03:23:19.186
THE HOUSING IS LESS EXPENSIVE SO

03:23:19.253 --> 03:23:21.889
WE KNOW THAT.

03:23:21.956 --> 03:23:22.890
THAT LA COUNTY HI THAT'S RIGHT

03:23:22.957 --> 03:23:23.524
THAT'S RIGHT BUT THE POPULATION

03:23:23.591 --> 03:23:24.659
DOES CONTINUE.

03:23:24.725 --> 03:23:25.960
TO MOVE DOESN'T SEE COUNTY LINES

03:23:26.027 --> 03:23:28.462
IT SEES THE NEED GOING.

03:23:28.529 --> 03:23:29.830
AND EVERYWHERE THIS NEED IT SO

03:23:29.897 --> 03:23:30.998

WE GOT TO GET WATER LA FOR FOR

03:23:37.371 --> 03:23:38.439

03:23:41.475 --> 03:23:42.877
THE FOSTER USE.

03:23:42.944 --> 03:23:44.845
IF WE CAN GET THAT PILOT GOING

03:23:44.912 --> 03:23:46.347

03:23:51.986 --> 03:23:52.520
THAT BECAUSE YOU WON'T HAVE TO

03:23:52.587 --> 03:23:53.321

BASED ON WHAT WE SAW WITH THE

03:25:17.238 --> 03:25:18.472
GROWING CONCERN IN CALIFORNIA

03:25:18.539 --> 03:25:19.940
OVER THE LINK BETWEEN CHILD

AND MORE HOMELESSNESS BUT CAN

03:25:31.252 --> 03:25:32.720
NOT IN AND OF ITSELF BE A BASIS

03:25:32.787 --> 03:25:34.789
FOR REMOVAL THERE'S ABSOLUTELY A

03:25:34.855 --> 03:25:37.358
LINK BETWEEN REFERRALS TO CPS.

03:25:37.425 --> 03:25:38.693

03:25:38.759 --> 03:25:40.227
AND EVEN MORE COMMON FAMILIES

03:25:40.294 --> 03:25:41.996

REUNIFY WE KNOW ARE NOT BEING

03:25:46.033 --> 03:25:47.601
REUNIFIED BECAUSE JUDGES ARE

03:25:47.668 --> 03:25:50.371

I'M IN SO WE LITERALLY HAVE A

03:25:53.074 --> 03:25:54.308

03:25:55.676 --> 03:25:56.544
REASON.

03:25:56.610 --> 03:25:57.778
BUT FOR THE FACT THAT THEIR

03:25:59.914 --> 03:26:01.248

ARE WAITING BECAUSE WE DON'T

03:27:24.999 --> 03:27:27.368

03:27:36.043 --> 03:27:37.545
BUT CLEARLY THE EARLY RESULTS

03:27:37.611 --> 03:27:39.046

STANDPOINT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

03:28:45.846 --> 03:28:47.681
ALTHOUGH IT'S EXACTLY RIGHT THIS

03:49:41.234 --> 03:49:44.103
BE ABLE TO HAVE WHAT THEY NEED

03:49:44.170 --> 03:49:45.304
TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF

03:49:45.371 --> 03:49:45.671
THESE CHILDREN.

03:49:45.738 --> 03:49:47.874
AND I AM ABSOLUTELY ALSO IN

03:49:47.940 --> 03:49:49.809
SUPPORT OF TWO THREE AND FOUR I

03:49:49.876 --> 03:49:51.477
WORK WITH EMANCIPATED FORCED

03:49:51.544 --> 03:49:53.613

03:49:54.580 --> 03:49:56.382

03:49:56.449 --> 03:49:58.317
NOT GET INTO THP THE NUMBER OF

03:49:58.384 --> 03:49:59.752
KIDS ON A WAIT LIST DOESN'T EVEN

03:49:59.819 --> 03:50:01.420
TOUCH BECAUSE THERE ARE A WHOLE

03:50:01.487 --> 03:50:02.822
BUNCH OF KIDS THAT NEVER EVEN

03:50:02.889 --> 03:50:03.956
MADE IT TO THE WAIT LIST.

03:50:04.023 --> 03:50:05.124
BECAUSE THERE'S NO POINT TO GET

03:50:05.191 --> 03:50:07.326
ON THE WAIT LIST SO THEY HAVE TO

03:50:07.393 --> 03:50:08.728

03:50:08.794 --> 03:50:09.695
POSSIBLE.

03:50:11.297 --> 03:50:13.032
PROBABLY NOT THE MOST ACCURATE.

03:50:13.099 --> 03:50:16.602
