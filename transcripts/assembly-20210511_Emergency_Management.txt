AS WE PROCEED WITH THE WITNESS AND PUBLIC COMMENT I WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THAT THE SOMEBODY HAS RULES. TO ENSURE WE MAINTAIN ORDER AND RUN AN EFFICIENT HEARING. WE SEEK TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF ALL. THOSE WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. SO THAT WE CAN HAVE AN EFFECT OF DELIBERATION AND DISCUSSIONS ON THE CRITICAL ISSUES FACING CALIFORNIA. IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THESE GOALS WE WOULD NOT PERMIT CONDUCT THAT DISRUPTS DISTURBS OR OTHERWISE IMPEDES THE ORDERLY CONDUCT. OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCEEDINGS. IN ADDITION THIS YEAR WILL ONCE AGAIN BE COMPLYING WITH ALL PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS ARISING OUT OF THE NOT OVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC. WITH THAT SAID AS ONE OF THIS SEPTEMBER WILL MARK TWENTY YEARS SINCE THE TRAGIC NINE ELEVEN ATTACK. SINCE THEN MUCH OF OUR HOMELAND SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE AND EFFORTS HAVE BEEN DIRECTED TOWARDS COMBATING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. WHILE REMAIN DILIGENT RESPONDING TO THIS CONTINUED THREAT CONCERNING ESCALATIONS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM ARE COMING FROM WITHIN OUR OWN BORDERS AND STATES. AS RECENTLY AS THIS WEEK AND WE SAW THE POTENTIAL ACT OF DOMESTIC TERROR WHEN THE COLONIAL PIPELINE A FUEL PIPELINE THE RUNS FROM TEXAS TO NEW YORK WAS SHUT DOWN DUE TO A CYBER ATTACK. AS THIS PIPELINE RESPONSIBLE ROUGHLY FOR ROUGHLY SUPPLY. THIS ATTACK HAS SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES. THE MASTER CARE ROZUM IS NOT NEW BUT IS FREQUENCY HAS BEEN STEADILY INCREASING NO REALLY AND CHOICE IN WHEN THE POLITICS SHERMAN STORMED THE FEDERAL CAPITAL BUILDING ON JANUARY SIXTH OF THIS YEAR. FOLLOWING THIS DEADLY ATTACK- EVENT DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AMERICA'S IDENTIFIED DOMESTIC TERRORISM AS THE SINGLE MOST SIGNIFICANT TERROR RELATED THREAT TO UNITED STATES I PROMISE TO FURTHER BOLSTER RESOURCE OF THE EIGHT IN THE START MITIGATION AND RESPONSE. HOWEVER A SUCCESSFUL RESPONSE THIS PROJECT. ON THE COLLABORATION OF THE ENTIRE HOME IT'S PRETTY NETWORK INCLUDING STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERS AND LOCAL PARTNERS. AS ALWAYS CALIFORNIA PLAYED A LARGE ROLE IN THIS FIGHT. THE GROWTH OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM AND THE SUBSTANTIAL THREAT IT POSES TO OUR SAFETY AND DEMOCRACY IS UNDENIABLE AND TODAY WE HAVE A NUMBER OF KEY. PARTNERS HERE TO ADDRESS THIS TOPIC. TODAY I HOPE WE HAVE DISCUSSION WHICH LEAVES CALIFORNIA'S BETTER PREPARED AND REASSURED. ON THE FIRST PANEL WILL HEAR FROM TOM O'CONNOR SPECIAL AGENT FBI RETIRED INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC TERRORISM EXPERT. JOHN BLOWS A KISS DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER OF TERRORISM EXTREMISM AND COUNTERTERRORISM CENTER OF THE MIDDLEBURY INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES AT MONTEREY. ON THE SECOND PANEL WILL HEAR FROM MARK COLOR DO CHIU DIRECTOR OF COAL YES TOM OSBORNE CAL OH YES DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF HOMELAND SECURITY. JOHN STEDMAN DIRECTOR OF THE JOINT REGIONAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER. AND MIKE SEAMAN DIRECTOR NORTH KELLER NORTHERN CALIFORNIA REGIONAL THREAT INTEGRATION CENTER. BEFORE YOU BEGAN ARE THERE ANY OPENING REMARKS FROM THE MOISTURE OR ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YEAH GALLAGHER OKAY WHAT THAT SAID I KNOW WE HAVE UP TO SENATOR CENTER- BURKE CHAIR OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY-WOULD YOU LIKE TO PROVIDE ANY OPENING REMARKS SENATORS HOPE YOU'RE HERE. HOW ABOUT ALSO SENATOR STERN CHAIR OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE ON EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. CENTER STAR- NOT THERE OKAY WITHOUT THE SEAKER ON THE FIRST PANEL. TOM O'CONNOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO BEGIN WITH. NO CHAIR RODRIGUEZ FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY- ACTUALLY HAVING ME IN MY IN MY OFFICE AT HOME HERE TODAY BUT- IT'S A OF AN HONOR TO BE ASKED TO SPEAK- TO THIS GROUP- IN CALIFORNIA. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT- WE ALSO POINT OUT THAT- TODAY CALIFORNIA LAW THIRTY POLICE OFFICER- TO DO- GUN VIOLENCE HE WAS KILLED AFTER SERVING A SEARCH WARRANT. OFFICER LEWIS BENNETT DAVEY FROM SAN LUIS OBISPO IS- THE LATEST POLICE OFFICER KILLED IN THE UNITED STATES AND- DURING POLICE WEEK I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE A POINT THAT OUT- I'M GOING TO- GO TO THE PRESENTATION NOW. SO FOR A FOR UP AND EVERYBODY CAN SEE THE PRESENTATION- WHAT I'M GONNA DO TODAY'S TALK ABOUT DOMESTIC EXTREMISM AND KIND OF WHAT IT IS WHAT IT ISN'T. AND THE DIFFICULTIES IN WORKING DOMESTIC TERRORISM AND HOW IT IS WORKED- THROUGH THE- JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCES WHICH INCLUDE AS YOU SAID CHAIRMAN THE- LOCAL AND STATE- ENTITIES ON THAT TASK FORCE WHICH REALLY BRINGS- THE ENTIRE- JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCE TOGETHER TO MAKE IT EFFICIENT. OKAY SO DOMESTIC TERRORISM ALTHOUGH QUICKLY- IS- AN ACTIVE WHICH IS DANGEROUS TO HUMAN LIFE SO A VIOLENT ACTION THAT'S THE EASY PART THAT'S THE PART. THAT WHEN A SHOOTING TAKES PLACE FOR A BOMBING TAKE PLACE EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT YOU HAVE THAT EVENT- PEOPLE WILL QUICKLY SAY THAT TERRORISM. AND THAT'S WHERE IT GETS A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT AND TAKES MORE TIME TO FIGURE OUT AND THAT'S WHAT THE MEMBERS OF THE JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCES WORKING WITH THE STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERS. ARE THERE TO FIGURE OUT IS THAT VIOLENT EVENT WHAT IT INTENDED TO INTIMIDATE OR COERCE A CIVILIAN POPULATION OR TO INFLUENCE THE POLICY OF A GOVERNMENT. AND IF SO THEN IT CAN FALL INTO THE DEFINITION OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM. IF THAT THREAT CAME FROM WITHIN THE UNITED STATES CURRENT PRIMARILY WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES- WORKING DOMESTIC TERRORISM VERSUS WORKING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM- ALWAYS IS MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND- THE CONSTITUTION RIGHTS WHICH ARE AFFORDED. TO CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES. WHAT THIS SAYS IS THAT. YOU CAN'T OPEN INVESTIGATION THE FBI OR LAW ENFORCEMENT CANNOT OPEN INVESTIGATION BASED SOLELY ON FIRST AMENDMENT ACTIVITY. AND THAT- COMES INTO PLAY A LOT OF TIMES WHEN- PEOPLE SAY OH THEY SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THIS GROUP OR THAT GROUP THIS MOVEMENT OF THAT MOVEMENT. WHEN ALL THEY'RE REALLY DOING IS EXERCISING THEIR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS IT'S SOMETHING THAT COMES UP QUITE OFTEN WITH DOMESTIC EXTREMISTS. ON THE OUTSIDES ARE WHERE THEY WERE THEY'RE FEELING INFRINGED UPON THEIR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS. TO LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS TO HAVE A VALID PURPOSE THERE HAS TO BE SOME- BELIEVE OR POSSIBILITY OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY TAKE PLACE. TO OPEN UP LOWER LEVEL INVESTIGATIONS AND THEN THERE IS A MYRIAD OF- LEVELS OF AUTHORITY WHICH HAVE TO BE MET TO MOVE FORWARD. TO GIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT- THOSE ABILITIES TO FOLLOW FOLLOW A LOT OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS- AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT WHEN. IT COMES TO WHO FIRST MEMBER RIGHTS AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION RELATED TO- INVESTIGATIONS THE FIRST AMENDMENT- WILL ALWAYS WENT OUT AND- SOMETIMES- THAT GETS A LITTLE DICEY WHEN SOMETHING TAKES PLACE. AND PEOPLE SAY HEY- THE FBI OR LAW ENFORCEMENT KNEW ABOUT THIS PERSON- WELL THEY MIGHT HAVE KNOWN BUT WHAT THEY KNEW WAS ONLY FIRST REMEMBER PROTECTED ACTIVITY THAT THEY COULDN'T REALLY- GO FURTHER ON THERE WAS THERE WAS NO THERE THERE AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT. ARE GOING FORWARD- DOMESTIC EXTREMISM IN THE FBI IS BROKEN DOWN INTO THESE CATEGORIES IN THIS THIS CHANGED. IN IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. A IT REALLY WAS A GOOD SHOW. ARE GOING FOR. STRAIGHT UP WHITE SUPREMACY EXTREMISM- BLACK SEPARATISM EXTREMISM TO THESE RACIALLY MOTIVATED VIOLENT EXTREMISM YOU'LL SEE THE WORD VIOLENT INCLUDING EACH ONE OF THESE CATEGORIES. AND THAT IS WHY- THE FBI HAS THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS IS BECAUSE OF THE VIOLENCE. THEY'RE NOT LOOKING AT THE IDEOLOGIES ARE NOT LOOKING AT MOVEMENTS THEY'RE LOOKING AT VIOLENCE ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE- ENTITIES. TO FURTHER THEIR COSTS SO RIGHT NOW THE WAY IT'S SET UP RACIALLY MOTIVATED VIOLENCE REMAINS ANTI GOVERNMENT ANTI AUTHORITY MOTIVATED BY EXTREMIST. THAT CAN ACTUALLY MIX WITH DIFFERENT PLAYERS- WHICH IS REALLY THE RIGHT WAITED TO LOOK AT THIS AND WHEN WE WHEN WE GET INTO THE DIFFERENT- IDEOLOGIES YOU'LL YOU'LL SEE HOW SOME OF THEM WILL CROSS- CROSS SECTIONS HERE. THIS CLEAR IS NOT TERRORISM AND I THINK THIS IS WHAT THE PREVIOUS LIFE REALLY EXPLAIN- WE HAVE A DEFINITION OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM- BUT THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS RULE ONE IT WASN'T NAMED THE FIRST AMENDED BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF IMPORTANT- THE PHOTOGRAPH ON THE LEFT A BLACK LIVES MATTER RALLY- PEOPLE. YOU KNOW YELLING AND SCREAMING ON THE RIGHT A STOP THE STEEL- EVENT AND THAT IS PEOPLE YELLING AND SCREAMING. THE FIRST AMENDMENT GIVES US THE RIGHT TO PEACEABLE ASSEMBLY THAT DOES NOT MEAN QUIET ASSEMBLY. BOTH OF THESE PHOTOGRAPHS SHOW PEOPLE EXERCISING THEIR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS THERE IS NOTHING ILLEGAL HERE AND THERE IS NOTHING TO COLLECT HERE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. THIS IS WHERE THE FIRST AMENDMENT WINS. WE'LL GET INTO NOW THE PATRIOT MILITIA MOVEMENT- IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES HOW WE BUILD WHY IT WHY IT WAS THERE AND HOW DO WE GET TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY. HE QUICKLY- THE PATRIOTS AND MILITIA MOVEMENTS THREE PERCENTERS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS NEW TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE- IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES LATE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES THAT MOVEMENT REALLY BEGAN TO GROW- AND IT DID SO BECAUSE IN THE EIGHTIES THERE WAS A- DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY IF WE REMEMBER THE GAS- CRUNCH WERE PEOPLE WAITING IN LINES- THERE WERE PEOPLE THAT PERCEIVE THE OVERSTEP OF THE GOVERNMENT- WITH EVENTS LIKE RUBY RIDGE AND WACO- AND- THAT REALLY. BLEW THE- RIGHT WING EXTREMISM AND IN THE SEVENTIES YOU HAD THE WEATHER UNDERGROUND. AND THE LEFT WING SO ONE. GROUP. SHUTDOWNS WITH THE- VACCINATIONS AND WE'LL GET INTO THAT IN JUST A SECOND. IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES AND TWO THOUSAND THERE WERE LARGE GROUPS THAT WERE IN THE UNITED STATES THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE THE BOTTOM RIGHT IS WILLIAM PIERCE WILLIAM PIERCE. HAD THOUSANDS OF FOLLOWERS HE WAS A PHD- HE WAS A SMART GUY- HE HAD A COMPOUND IN HILLSBORO WEST VIRGINIA WHERE HE RAN A VANGUARD RECORDS- OUTFIT WHERE HE SOLD WHITE POWER MUSIC HE IS ACTUALLY THE AUTHOR OF THE TURNER DIARIES WHICH IN THE BOOK THAT- TIMOTHY MCVEIGH. USE THAT THE BLUEPRINT FOR IS NINETEEN NINETY FIVE ATTACK ON THE MURRAH FEDERAL BUILDING. THE PHOTOGRAPH IN THE IN THE UPPER UPPER RIGHT CORNER IS RICHARD BUTLER RICHARD BUTLER WAS THE HEAD OF THE ARIAN NATIONS ERIN NATIONS WAS A WHITE SUPREMACIST ANTI SEMITIC GROUP- BASED OUT OF COURT ELAINE IDAHO. AND AGAIN THIS GENTLEMAN OR USE THAT PHRASE- LOOSELY BUT THIS GUY WAS A CHARISMATIC SPEAKER HAD A FOLLOWING OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE- BECAUSE THEY WERE ABLE TO SPEAK. WHAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE IS THE PLATFORMS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TODAY THE KU KLUX KLAN HAS BEEN AROUND THROUGH OUR HISTORY SINCE THE CIVIL WAR- IT HAS GONE IN EBBS AND FLOWS. IN THE SIXTIES AND HAD- QUITE A FOLLOWING AND THEN IN THE SEVENTIES THE FBI- THROUGH UNDERCOVER OPERATIONS REALLY DECIMATED THE VERY VERY COMPLEX CLAN- THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT'S GONE THERE ARE OTHER GROUPS WERE OPERATING IN THE- NINETIES AND TWO THOUSANDS. SOME OF THEM ARE STILL HERE TODAY BUT WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS THE GROUP THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY WITHIN A FEW YEARS- I PREDICT THAT THOSE GROUPS WILL NO LONGER BE IN EXISTENCE BUT THEY'LL BE IN ANOTHER FORM A DIFFERENT NAME THESE GROUPS GENERALLY CHANGE THEIR NAME- BUT THE IDEOLOGY. STAY THE SAME GOING FORWARD. THE NATURAL I INTO. AND HELD A LOT GROUP- RALLY AT THE U. S. CAPITOL SO- EVENTS AT THE U. S. CAPITOL ARE NOTHING NEW- AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED BILLION NOT THE SHOWED UP AT THE U. S. CAPITOL. THEY HAD A PERMIT THEY MARCHED. IN WHERE YOU SEE IN THE PHOTOGRAPH ON THE LEFT THE NEO *** ARE TO THE FAR LEFT INTO THE- IN THE CENTER IS. A LARGE POLICE PRESENCE THE IDEA IS TO KEEP THOSE TWO ENTITIES APART. AND THAT IS WHERE YOU HAVE A PEACEFUL FIRST AMENDMENT ACTIVITY ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS- THIS POINT- AND- THE DAY GOES BY WITHOUT IN A BET IT'S WHERE THEY BREAK OFF AND RUN INTO EACH OTHER FIND EACH OTHER. THAT THE VIOLENCE TAKES PLACE- WHERE YOU HAVE NEO **** MARCHING YOU WILL HAVE ANTI FASCIST ACTION. IN OUR KISS OVERALL AND BEAR THE END AYE FASCISTS WERE DESIGNED TO COUNTER THE NEO **** MOVEMENT. UP THE ANARCHIST MOVEMENT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS AND- AS YOU GUYS ARE IN CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW FULL WELL- ABOUT THE- OFFENSE IN. SEATTLE PORTLAND AND OTHER BIG CITIES WHERE THE WORLD BANK A PROTESTER PLACE AND THAT WAS THE ANARCHISTS WHO WERE DOING- DAMAGE TO VIOLENCE- IN. YOU KNOW AS THE BURNINGS DESTROYING BILDINGS THIS TYPE OF STUFF- WHERE YOU HAVE ANTI FOR YOU WILL THEN HAVE A GROWTH OF RIGHT WING EXTREMISTS. TO COUNTER THEM ALSO. WHERE THE BIG THREAT THAT WE IS FROM THE LOAN OF THE PERSON THAT MAY BE TIED TO A MOVEMENT OR A GROUP. BUT THEY FEEL THAT THAT MOVEMENT A GROUP IS REALLY NOT DOING WHAT THEY THINK THEY SHOULD DO THEY'RE THE ONES THAT HAVE TO BE. THE ONES TO STEP OUT AND ACTUALLY COMMIT VIOLENT ACTIONS IN ORDER TO FOR THEIR MOVEMENT WHATEVER THAT HAPPENS TO BE. AND I'M GONNA GO THROUGH SOME- SOME EVENTS IN WASHINGTON DC- THAT SHOWED EXACTLY THAT- TWO THOUSAND NINE THE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM WAS ATTACKED BY A- MAN NAMED JAMES VENN BREWING HE WAS EIGHTY EIGHT YEARS OLD. SO NOT YOUR AVERAGE WHAT YOU WOULD SAY A PROFILE OF A DOMESTIC EXTREMIST OR A LONE OFFENDER. FUND BROOM WAS EIGHTY EIGHT AND HE APPROACH THE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM WITH A TWENTY TWO CALIBER- PUMP- RIFLE. AND HE FIRED ONE ROUND INTO THE- GOOD THE DOOR WHEN IT WAS OPENED BY AN OFFICER NAMED OSCAR JOHNS HE WAS SHOT AND KILLED ON SCENE HERE. SO- THIS IS THE LONE OFFENDERS HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE FOR YEARS AND WILL GO FORWARD TO THE TWO THOUSAND TEN PENTAGON SHOOTING- JOHN PATRICK BEDELL DROVE ALL THE WAY FROM CALIFORNIA. TO THE U. S. PENTAGON HIS GOAL WAS TO ATTACK THE U. S. PENTAGON THE SEAT OF OUR MILITARY INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE HE BELIEVED VERY STRONGLY AGAINSTTHE WAR THING AFGHANISTAN IN IRAQ. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THESE TWO EVENTS YOU HAVE A RIGHT WING ATTACK A NEO MEMORIAL INVITES THE MEDIC. AND A LESS WING ATTACK IN GUN- AT THE U. S. PENTAGON- IN TWO THOUSAND AT THE FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL IN WASHINGTON DC- FORTY CORGAN'S A SECOND WALKED INTO THE FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL AND HE OPENED FIRE ON THE UNARMED SECURITY GUARD- THIS WAS A ATTACK BY A- A SELF PROCLAIMED GAY RIGHTS ACTIVISTS WHO AFTER THE CHICK FILLET- OWNER CAME OUT AGAINST GAY RIGHTS. AND THE FAMILY RESEARCH CENTER WHERE HE ATTACKED US SUPPORTED THAT- BIG THE- THE CHICK FILLET- NARRATIVE- THIS MAN WENT FROM PROTEST BUYING A GUN IN GETTING INSIDE THE SECURED AREA AND FIRING A GUN AND SHOOTING OF THE UNARMED SECURITY OFFICER WENT ONCE THE GUN WAS TAKING HIM BACK TO TAKEN FROM HIM BY THE SECURITY OFFICER WHO WAS SHOT. HE SAID DON'T SHOOT ME DON'T SHOOT ME IT'S NOT THIS PLACE IT'S THEIR POLICIES- INTO- HE FIRED UPON THE SECURITY GUARD SHOOTING HIM UP BECAUSE OF. THE POLICIES OF THE FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL. HOW DO YOU GET IN FRONT OF THIS SO IT HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY HUMAN INTELLIGENCE GETTING OUT AND ACTUALLY SPEAKING TO PEOPLE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY GOOD PEOPLE. AND PEOPLE WHO MAY BE. MEMBERS OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS- LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN TALK TO ANYONE THEY CAN TALK TO PEOPLE IT'S THAT IS WHAT THEIR JOB IS THEY REALLY SHOULD BE OUT THERE TALKING TO PEOPLE- BUILDING SOURCES OF INTELLIGENCE. AND THAT WILL BRING US TO THE DIGITAL MEDIA ELECTRONICS AND THOSE PEOPLE WILL TELL US MANY TIMES WHEN THERE'S AN EVENT THAT COULD TAKE PLACE AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO GET IN FRONT OF THAT. IN TWO THOUSAND TEN I GAVE A PRESENTATION THIS OF THE SLIDE FROM THAT- THAT THAT- PRESENTATION IT SHOWS THE CHANGE EVEN BACK THEN GOING FROM MAILING LIST EMAILS TELEPHONE OR CELL PHONE. NOW WE'RE WE'RE THIS IS ON STEROIDS RIGHT SO. WHEN WE DO GET A- INFORMATION THAT SOMETHING IS HAPPENING THOSE EVENTS I TALK ABOUT THIS NOW SADLY WE DIDN'T GET IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE. HERE WE GOT INFORMATION THAT THIS- DRUG STORY- BY SAYING THAT I'M SOCIAL MEDIA HE WAS POSTING. THAT HE WANTED TO KILL POLICE OFFICERS AND MILITARY WHEN THE RACIAL HOLY WAR BEGINS THE RAPALA- SO WE CASE WAS ABLE TO BE OPENED UP. IT'S A DIFFICULT- TO WORK DOMESTIC TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS- THAT WE HAVE A DEFINITION. BUT THE CASES ARE WORKED UNDER OTHER CRIMINAL. CHARGES BECAUSE THERE IS NO. PENALTY ATTACHED TO THE DEFINITION OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM. IN THIS CASE- STORY- ALSO STATED THAT HE WANTED TO- THAT THAT. IT WOULD BE- TO SHOW THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA AT THE TIME WITH MORE THAN A MERE MOTAL AND ONE WAY TO SHOW THAT HE WAS NOT- IMMORTAL IS THE THIRTY ODD SIX TO THE BASE OF THE SKULL HE SAID THE SAME THING. FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL HOLDER AND THIS WAS- FOUND NOT TO BE A THREAT- HE THEN SAID HE WANTED TO GET HIS GUN MADE FULLY AUTOMATIC SO WE HAD AN OPEN CASE. WE WORK THAT CASE WE GOT UNDER COVER INTRODUCED AND THAT UNDER COVER- GOT THE GUN FROM HIM. AND WE ARE ABLE TO BRING THE GUN TO QUANTICO GET IT MADE FULLY AUTOMATIC. RETURN IT TO HIM AND HE WAS ARRESTED FOR POSSESSION OF A MACHINE GUN HE WAS NOT CHARGED WITH- WITH THREATS. OF THE FACT THAT HE'S A MEMBER OF THE ARYAN NATIONS COULD NOT BE BROUGHT UP BECAUSE THAT IS THE FIRST MEMBER PROTECTED ACTIVITY- SO HE WAS CHARGED WITH POSSESSION OF MACHINE GUNS. A TEN YEAR FELONY HE ACTUALLY GOT TWELVE MONTHS. AT. THE TIME OF HIS ARREST THE A SEARCH WARRANT WAS CONDUCTED. ALL SIX THOUSAND ROUNDS- FOR IS A CAPE SEVEN WORK. AND TWO DRUMS WHICH HELD SEVENTY ROUNDS EACH SO WITH A FULLY AUTOMATIC MACHINE GUN. WITH SEVENTY ROUNDS- UP TO SEVEN AROUND PROBLEMS HE COULD REALLY HAVE DONE A LOT OF DAMAGE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. I JUST BY PUTTING IN A FAKE CALL. HOW IS IT MESSAGE CHANGED- THE MESSAGE JAMES FROM BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE WHEN WE HAVE A KU KLUX KLAN RALLY ON THE LEFT- TO THE CHARLOTTESVILLE EVENT ON THE RIGHT- SOCIAL MEDIA- ON THE LEFT YOU HAD TO DO FACE BY FACE TALKING. TELEPHONE CALLS TO GET PEOPLE TO COME TO AN EVENT SUCH AS A CROSS BURNING HERE. ON THE RIGHT THIS IS THE NIGHT BEFORE THE CHARLOTTESVILLE EVENT AND YOU HAVE ABOUT A THOUSAND PEOPLE THERE THAT SHOWED UP. AFTER BEING NOTIFIED THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA THAT THAT'S GOING TO TAKE PLACE THIS WAS OVER THE STATUES THAT WERE- THE TAKE THE STATUE DOWN LEAVE THE THANK YOUS UP DEBATE- BUT IF YOU'RE A PERSON WHO BELIEVE THE STATUE SHOULD STAY UP FOR HISTORICAL PURPOSES. AND YOUR MARCHING DOWN THE THIS- COLLEGE CAMPUS AND YOU HEAR PEOPLE CHANTING JEWS WILL NOT REPLACE US AND FIRE UP THE OVENS BOYS. YOU SHOULD BLOW OUT YOUR TORCH AND GO HOME AND THE FACT THAT THEY HAD TORCHES- SAYSTHAT THERE IS SOME FINANCING VETS BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A PICNIC IN YOUR HOUSE AND YOU GO BY. TIKI TORCHES THEY'RE NOT CHEAP BY A THOUSAND OF THEM IT ADDS UP TO A LOT OF MONEY SO THERE'S SOMEWHERE THERE IS FUNDING COMING TO THIS. POTENTIALLY FROM OVERSEAS ADVERSARIES. OR THROUGH SALES OF MEMORABILIA. AND STUFF WITHIN THE UNITED STATES ITSELF. SO THE COMMUNICATION CHANGE THAT MADE ALL OF THIS TAKING EXTREMISM THAT WE HAVE IN THE UNITED STATES AND PUTTING GASOLINE ON THAT FIRE. I COULD CHANGE THIS LIGHT EVERY SINGLE DAY BECAUSE EACH ONE OF THESE. DIFFERENT PLATFORMS HAS EITHER DEEP PLATFORM BUT- LOCATIONS OR- GROUPS OR THEY'VE- GONE ALONG THE WAY THE- THE WAY OF THE DODO BIRD AND ARE NO LONGER THERE BUT THEY CHANGED. AND THEIR THEIR STOOD UP AGAIN AS YOU SEE. THE PLATFORMING TAKING PLACE YOU'LL SEE THE PLATFORM BEING SET UP UNDER A DIFFERENT- ENTITIES- TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN CHARLOTTESVILLE. HEATHER HIGHER WITH KILLED. WHEN A CAR WAS DRIVEN INTO A CROWD- THIS WAS CLEARLY SOMETHING THAT FIT THE DEFINITION OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM- THE DRIVER WAS CHARGED WITH. HOMICIDE HE WAS CHARGED WITH WITH- HATE CRIMES BUT HE WAS NEVER CHARGED WITH DOMESTIC TERRORISM BECAUSE AS I SAID THERE IS NO PENALTY ATTACHED TO THE DEFINITION OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THERE SHOULD BE ONE FEDERALLY. CURRENTLY THERE IS NOT ONE- REPUBLICAN BASEBALL SHOOTING IN JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. A PERSON WHO WENT FROM TAX PRO TESTING. TO SHOWING UP AT A BASEBALL FIELD IN ALEXANDRIA VIRGINIA ASKING IF THIS WAS THE REPUBLICANS OR THE DEMOCRATS AND THEN OPENING FIRE WITH A LONG WEAPON- THIS FITS THE DEFINITION OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM CLEARLY. AS THOSE LAWMAKERS- WERE WERE ATTACKED BECAUSE OF THEIR POLITICAL VIEWS AND THAT THE- BALK FORCE OR VIOLENCE WAS DONE TO- INFLUENCE THE POLICY OF A GOVERNMENT. THREE OF LIFE YOU ROBERT POWERS THANKS. AND GAB HAD A FOLLOWING ON GAB ACTUALLY LIVE STREAMED HIS- HIS GOING INTO THE TREE OF LIFE. AND KILLED ELEVEN PARISHIONERS OR FOLLOWERS AT THE TREE OF LIFE SYNAGOGUE. IN A IN A CASE THAT IS A- IT'S- DISGUSTING HE ACTUALLY WENT IN THERE AND HUNTED DOWN PEOPLE- IN HIS FOLLOWING ON GAB WAS WAS- WAS. YOU KNOW TEARING HIM OUT AS HE WAS DOING THIS- TWO OF THEM THE PEOPLE WHO WERE CHEERING A MONOMER FOLLOWERS IN HIM LIVED IN WASHINGTON DC. THE TWO BROTHERS THAT ARE CIRCLED IN THE- TOP LEFT- THE CLARK BROTHERS- THE JANE THE JAMES ALEX FIELD IN THE FRONT LEFT THAT'S THE DRIVER FROM CHARLOTTESVILLE THE KILLED HEATHER HIGHER SO YOU CAN SEE THE CONNECTIONS THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA. AND IN PERSON EVENTS- HOW THIS TAKES PLACE ON THE RIGHT IS- THE RICHARD SPENCER LEADER OF THE ALT RIGHT WITH. THE CLARK BROTHERS IN FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE. THE SHOOTING THE L. EN EL PASO OF THE WALMART THAT MOVED- HOMICIDES BY RIGHT WING EXTREMISTS WHITE SUPREMACISTS- IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TO FIFTY ONE MURDERS THE MOST- SINCE THE HATE CRIMES BEGAN BEING TRACKED- BOOGALOO BOYS BOOGALOO BOYS ARE A GROUP THAT IS ANTI GOVERNMENT. VERY STRONG ANTI POLICE- THEY STARTED SHOWING UP AROUND THE ANTI VACCINE SECOND AMENDMENT- OFFENSE IN VIRGINIA AND MICHIGAN. AND IN CALIFORNIA IN OAKLAND A BLUE BOY KILLED A FEDERAL PROTECTIVE OFFICER AT THE OAKLAND COURTHOUSE AND THEN- KILLED A SHERIFF'S WHEN. POLICE RAIDED HIS- FAMILY HOUSE- IN HERE'S I THESE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES AND A LONG WEAPON- TO DO HIS CRIMES HE WAS A FOLLOWER OF THE BOOGALOO MOVEMENT- PROUD BOYS WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT THE PROBLEM OR IS THERE REALLY THE FIGHT- TEAM OF THE RIGHT FOR THEIR MORE- LIKE THE- HOOLIGANS THAT- IN EUROPE- THERE THERE THERE TO COUNTER THE ANARCHIST. AS WE SAW OVER THE SUMMER THE VIOLENCE THAT CAME OUTSIDE OF THE BLACK LIVES MATTER EVENTS- WE SAW THE PROUD BOYS REALLY STANDING UP TO THAT AND BEING THE GROUP WHICH WHICH- SELF DESCRIBED COUNTER OF THE- THE ANARCHIST MOVEMENT IN THE THAT WAS FALLING OUTSIDE THE BLACK LIVES MATTER. PROTESTS PATRIOTS THREE PERCENTERS- I'VE WAY EVERY TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THEY AGAIN SEE THE DOWNSIDE DOWNSIDE OF THE ECONOMY RIGHT NOW- THERE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO TAKE- THEIR PERSONAL. ISSUES AND YOU CAN'T BLAME YOURSELF FOR THE THINGS YOU HAVE TO BLAME THE GOVERNMENT AND SO YOU'RE SEEING THAT THE RISE IN THE PATRIOT AND 3% OR MOVEMENT- THROW INTO THE MIX- CONSPIRACY THEORIES THE MAIN ONE CURRENTLY IS Q. ANON. WHERE WE GO ONE WE GO ALL- THIS HAS. THOUSANDS OF FOLLOWERS ONLINE- AND KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THEM NOW AS THAT WHAT THEY BELIEVE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AT THE TIME DONALD TRUMP WAS GOING TO STAY IN OFFICE HE DIDN'T- THIS IS A GROUP THAT. THAT BELIEVES THAT- THAT- DEMOCRATS AND LEFTISTS ARE ACTUALLY- KIDNAPPING CHILDREN DRINKING THEIR BLOOD FOR POWER- BUT THERE IF THEY HAVE A AN ENORMOUS FOLLOWING- IN THE UNITED STATES AND OVERSEAS. I'M ON TOP OF THE CONSPIRACY THEORIES YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL ONES THAT GO ALONG WITH THE VACCINE AND TO BE A PANDEMIC WHICH WE'RE DEALING WITH FIVE G. TECHNOLOGY- THERE'S A CONSPIRACY THEORY THAT THAT BELIEVES THAT BILL GATES. ARE WHO HAD SPOKEN ABOUT- PANDEMICS IN ILLNESSES AND THE NEED FOR VACCINATIONS. FOR YEARS- THAT- THAT BILL GATES WAS THE START WHAT OF THE- PANDEMIC AND HE DID SO BECAUSE HE WAS GOING TO USE THE VACCINATIONS WHICH WE'RE GETTING- TO IMPLANT A CHIP INTO ALL OF THE CITIZENS. AND PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD AND THEN THE FIVE G. TOWERS RETRACT THEM- YOU KNOW. THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT BELIEVE THESE THINGS AND YOU'LL SEEING YOU'RE SEEING Q. ONE ON GO FROM THE- STOP THE STEEL TO THE VACCINATION- THE BANKING THAT IT IS IT IS A BAD FORESTED THERE'S- ALL SORTS OF THINGS TO GO ALONG WITH THAT AN EXPLORATION OF THEM. ANYTHING GOES TO- TO MAKE THE FALSE SOCIETY. THE ATTACK IN THE CAPITAL INSIDE THERE WE HAD Q. FOLLOWERS WE HAD NEO **** ANTI GOVERNMENT GROUPS- AND ENGINES FOLLOWERS WHO WERE WERE LED THERE BY THE RHETORIC ONLINE. SO SOCIAL MEDIA HAS REALLY BECOME BE THE CATALYST FOR WHY- WHAT WAS ALREADY THERE IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES AND TWO THOUSANDS. IS WHERE IT IS TODAY BECAUSE OF THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE IN. SUCH A IMMEDIATE WAY- AND WITH THAT WILL- WILL STAY IN AND- GO TO- YOUR NEXT. OR ITS IT BACK IN AND- AND WATCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TOM FOR- YOUR- PRESENTATION NOW MOVE OVER TO JASON LAS VEGAS DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER ON TERRORISM EXTREMISM AND COUNTERTERRORISM CENTER OF THE MIDDLEBURY INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES AT MONTEREY JASON READY. GREAT TO BE HERE THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK WITH YOU ALL TODAY- IT'S GREAT TO BE IN THE ROOM WITH TOM CONNOR. I AM A SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW AT THE SUPERCENTER IN I'M IN MY OFFICE HERE IN MONTEREY CALIFORNIA MILITARY INSTITUTE SO I'M I'M NOT TOO FAR FROM YOU I WISH I COULD BE IN THE ROOM WITH YOU ALL- BUT- COBIT OBVIOUSLY PREVENT THAT FROM OCCURRING. SO WE'RE GONNA JUMP RIGHT INTO THE AGENDA- FIRST I'M GOING TO EXAMINE SPECIFIC RISKS RELATED TO THOSE WHO ARE FIRST RESPONDERS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE THREAT TODAY AS IT'S POSED BY DOMESTIC EXTREMISTS AND- EXTREMISTS WHO REMAIN INSPIRED BY FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS WHO AS THE NAME IMPLIES ARE PRIMARILY BASED OVERSEAS. THEN I WILL BE REALLY FOCUSED QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY ON. THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SCREAMS A LANDSCAPE- AUGMENTING- SOME OF THE THINGS THAT TOM HELPLESSLY- STARTED US OFF WITH TODAY AND THEN AT THE END OF MY PRESENTATION I'M I'LL GO INTO SOME CONCLUDING THOUGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR US TO CONSIDER. SO IN THE- TWENTY TWENTY TIME PERIOD IN JANUARY- THE NATIONAL COUNTERTERRORISM CENTER- PRODUCED A REALLY GOOD PRODUCT REGARDING DEATH THREATS SPECIFICALLY POSED TO. LAW ENFORCEMENT FIREFIGHTERS. EMTS AND PARAMEDICS AND IN THAT REPORT THEY TALK ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF AMBUSH ATTACKS THAT COULD THREATEN THE LIVES OF THESE TYPES OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINES TRYING TO PROTECT PEOPLE. AND TO SPECIFIC KINDS OF ATTACKS AMBUSH ATTACKS SPECIFICALLY WERE HIGHLIGHTED AS A THREAT TO FIRST RESPONDERS ONE WAS THE LORING AMBUSH ATTACK WHICH IS A PREMEDITATED ATTACK. IN WHICH THE OFFENDER LAWRENSON UNSUSPECTING TARGET TO A LOCATION TO EXECUTE ATTACK. AND THEN THERE IS THE OPPORTUNISTIC AMBUSH ATTACK WHICH IS AN UNPROVOKED ATTACK WITHOUT REALLY ANY LONG TERM PLANNING THAT THE OFFENDER CONSIDERS. A CRIME OF OPPORTUNITY AND MAKE THAT DECISION IF THERE AT THAT SPOT TO CARRY OUT THE SURPRISE ATTACK AGAINST THE TARGET- THESE KINDS OF ATTACKS. ARE PROBLEMATIC TO SAY THE LEAST BUT ALSO THERE ARE THE POSSIBILITIES OF SECONDARY EXPLOSIVE DEVICES THAT COULD TARGET FIRST RESPONDERS AND ONLOOKERS AFTER THE INITIAL TACK. TEARS MAY ACTUALLY TRY TO CARRY OUT A SPECIFIC ATTACK AND THEN AGAIN A SECOND ATTACK AGAINST THE FIRST RESPONDERS WHO ARE RESPONDING TO THAT FIRST ATTACK IN THAT ATTACK. COULD NOT BE IN THE SECONDARY ATTACKS COULD INCLUDE. ANY NUMBER OF- ACTIVITIES EXPLOSIVE DEVICES ON COULD BE HIDDEN IN BACKPACKS GARBAGE CANS MAILBOXES AND IN THIS IS A THREAT TO FIRST. RESPONDERS YOU ALSO. GOOD HAVE NOT TERRORISTS- IN PERSON EIGHT ESSENTIALLY RESP THEN PERHAPS BEST EXAMPLE I CAN RECALL OF THIS WITHIN THE LAST TEN YEARS WAS IN NORWAY WHERE- A WHITE SUPREMACIST BY NAME THE ANDERS BREIVIK CARRIED OUT A TERRIBLE. ATTACK IN NORWAY THAT RESULTED IN MANY DEATHS SIXTY EIGHT OF WHICH- HAPPENED ON THIS ISLAND IN A TOYOTA WHERE BREIVIK WAS DRESSED AS A POLICE OFFICER AND WENT AND HUNTED THE CHILDREN ON THAT ISLAND. ONE BY ONE IMPERSONATING ESSENTIALLY THE- I'M BEING ASKED TO STEP WHY DID MY SCREEN A LITTLE BIT HOPEFULLY THAT YOU CAN SEE IT A LITTLE BIT BETTER THERE- THE IT'S IMPERSONATING. A POLICE OFFICER IS ANOTHER MECHANISM WE NEED TO BE WORRIED ABOUT IN THE CONTEXT OF. AMBUSH RELATED ATTACKS AND THEN FINALLY- SHOULD BE AWARE AS WELL OF- ATTACKS IN WHICH- AMBULANCES OR OTHER KINDS OF- PERSONNEL REPORT ENTITY TO AN EQUITY ORIENTED- WHERE THE ACTUAL ACTIVITIES THE FIRST RESPONDERS CAN BE CO OPTED IN HOUSTON. THERE REALLY TWO EXAMPLES OF THIS I CAN THINK OF ONE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WHERE THE TERRORIST GROUP ISIS ESSENTIALLY USED AMBULANCES FOR AN ATTACK. AND THEN A TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHEN THE AFGHAN TALIBAN- CARRIED OUT A MAJOR ATTACK USING AMBULANCES THAT KILLED MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE VARIOUS WAYS IN WHICH- I REALLY WORRY ABOUT HOW- FIRST RESPONDER EQUIPMENT CAN BE USED OR HOW FIRST RESPONDERS. CAN BE TARGETED SPECIFICALLY. AND IT'S HAPPEN CAL RIGHT IN OUR STATE HERE AS WELL I'M BILL OF YOU THAT CAN. FROM FEBRUARY DESTINY. WHERE EMTS AND FIRST RESPONDERS- A FIREFIGHTER IN THE CAN DOWN AND A PARAMEDIC WERE TARGETED IN ANTIOCH CALIFORNIA BY A DRIVE BY SHOOTING DAYS THEY WERE THEY WERE AMBUSHED AND I THINK THAT IS A REAL EXAMPLE- IN OUR BACKYARD OF THESE KINDS OF TACTICS USING BEING USED IN THIS CASE. BY INDIVIDUALS MAY NOT NECESSARILY BEEN PART OF A FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION BUT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ENGAGED IN CRIMINALITY. BUT WE ALSO CAN'T FORGET ABOUT THE THREAT POSED BY GROUPS BASED OVERSEAS- AND HOW THEY CAN STILL INSPIRE INDIVIDUALS TO DO REAL WORLD HARM. IN THIS SENSE- THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY ISSUED REALLY IMPORTANT GUIDANCE IN APRIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE JUST LAST MONTH. ABOUT HOW INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY BE INSPIRED BY GROUPS LIKE AL QAEDA IN THE ISLAMIC STATE- ARE STILL MOTIVATING INDIVIDUALS TO CARRY OUT- AMBUSH LIKE STYLE ATTACKS IN HERE YOU HAVE A- SPECIFIC EXAMPLE I HAVE ON THIS POWER POINT SCREEN. OF AN INDIVIDUAL BY THE END OF THE SEASON SOME OF WHICH- WHO ATTACK THREE NEW YORK CITY POLICE OFFICERS WITH A KNIFE EVEN USING ESSENTIALLY THE CAMOUFLAGE OF BML PROTEST TO CARRY OUT THE ATTACK. AND AS TIME WENT ON WE LEARNED THAT SOME ADDITION CELL WAS INSPIRED BY SALAFI JIHADIST PROPAGANDA. IN IN THE OFFICIAL PUBLICATIONS OF ORGANIZATIONS LIKE AL QAEDA IN THE ISLAMIC STATE YOU STILL SEE- GROUPS LIKE AL QAEDA CALLING OUT FOR LONE WOLF OR LOAN OFFENDER ATTACKS AGAINST LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THIS SPECIFICALLY USE THAT CAMOUFLAGE OF PROTEST TO CARRY OUT THOSE ATTACKS. IN HERE YOU HAVE AN EXCERPT. FROM PUBLICATION BY AL QAEDA THAT'S CALLING ON. INDIVIDUALS TO CARRY OUT A MOLOTOV COCKTAIL ATTACKS SO THE DEPARTURE FROM THE KNIFE ATTACKS FROM THE PREVIOUS SCREEN- IN POWER POINT SLIDE BUT THE POINT HERE IS- THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE BEHIND THESE FOREIGN BASED GROUPS ARE A PERSISTENT THREAT. TO AMERICANS TODAY I'M IN THE CONTINUE TO INSPIRE INDIVIDUALS THAN THE SUM OF ITS ATTACK WAS JUST LAST YEAR SO WE CAN'T DISCOUNT THAT. POSSIBILITY OF THE FOREIGN BASED ON INFLUENCE THREATS MOVING FORWARD- THE SECOND THING I WOULD SAY IS- WE ALSO NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF HOW FOREIGN BASED GROUPS. CAN USE TACTICS THAT CAN BE EMULATED BY DOMESTIC EXTREMISTS MANY OF THOSE THAT TOM SPOKE ABOUT IN HIS POWER POINT SLIDE- IN. WHEN THEY DO THIS WITH GROUPS CARRY THIS OUT- THESE KINDS OF ATTACKS GROUPS LIKE HAMAS GROUPS LIKE HEZBOLLAH HAVE ACTUALLY MISUSED MEDICAL FACILITIES- TO ESSENTIALLY USE THOSE FACILITIES ASK COMMAND AND CONTROL CENTER SO THEY COULD STAGE ATTACKS. AGAINST GOVERNMENTS LIKE ISRAEL- AND YOU HAVE SOME EXAMPLES HERE IN THIS POWER POINT SLIDE WHERE I MENTION A FEW OF THESE IN A OF COURSE- DIS WOULD GO AGAINST. INTERNATIONAL LAW- PURSUANT TO THE GENEVA CONVENTION- MEDICAL NEUTRALITY ACTUALLY PREVENTS BAD ACTORS FROM ESSENTIALLY USING THESE KINDS OF FACILITIES TO CARRY OUT- TERRORIST ATTACKS OR ANY KINDS OF TAX IF IT'S THAT THE STATE AND STATE- ENGAGEMENTS AT THE- AT THE STATE LEVEL. I'M OBVIOUSLY TERRORIST GROUPS DON'T CARE ABOUT THESE RULES BUT WE STILL. NEED TO BE COGNIZANT OF THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE I USED IT IN THE- AS COVER- CHURCH CORPS- MEMBERS OF THE ORGAN. BEFORE THAT THESE KINDS OF TACTICS COULD ALSO BE DEPLOYED BY DOMESTIC EXTREMISTS MAY NOT BE ASSOCIATED WITH GROUPS LIKE HAMAS. THOSE OF US IN CALIFORNIA WILL REMEMBER WELL OF COURSE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SAMPOERNA DINO ATTACK CARRIED OUT BY A FOR REAL CAN AND MALIK WHO CARRIED OUT THE ATTACK AT THE INLAND REGIONAL CENTER- IN THAT PARTICULAR ATTACK IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE INDIVIDUALS WERE INSPIRED BY ISIS- THEY CARRIED THAT ATTACK OUT BECAUSE THEY WERE INSPIRED BY. THE FOREIGN BASED ORGANIZATION KNOWN AS THE ISLAMIC STATE I'M IN THEY CARRIED AN ATTACK THAT KILLED FOURTEEN INDIVIDUALS- AND INJURED TWO POLICE OFFICERS SO WE HAVE A ANOTHER EXAMPLE IN CALIFORNIA OF A SCENARIO IN WHICH A FOREIGN BASED GROUP- IS INFLUENCING THE ACTIVITIES INDIVIDUALS BASED IN UNITED STATES. ANOTHER MORE RECENT ATTACK AT THE END OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WAS ONE CARRIED OUT BY. AN INDIVIDUAL BY THE NAME OF MOHAMMED SAEED AL SHAMMARI- AND HE WAS AN INDIVIDUAL. WHO IS IN THE UNITED STATES ACTUALLY TRAINING IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS PART OF THE ROYAL SAUDI AIR FORCE- AT A AIR BASE AND IN PENSACOLA- IN FLORIDA. IN HE WAS EVENTUALLY- KNOWN TO HAVE. LINKS TO AL QAEDA IN THE ARABIAN PENINSULA AFTER HE CARRIED OUT HIS DEADLY ATTACKS ANOTHER EXAMPLE IN WHICH I JUST WANT TO. REMIND EVERYBODY THAT THE LINKS BETWEEN BAR GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY BE EITHER ALREADY IN UNITED STATES THAT CITIZENS. OR WHO ARE TRAVELLING THE UNITED STATES AND SOME KIND OF OFFICIAL CAPACITY THEY STILL POSE A RISK- BUT TRANSITIONING TO THE DOMESTIC RISK- IT IS VERY PRONOUNCED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND- YOU HAVE A SLIDE- THAT IS A HEAT MAP THAT ILLUSTRATES IN TWENTY TWENTY ACCORDING TO THE SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER. THE LOCATIONS IN WHICH HATE GROUPS ARE BASED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND AS YOU'LL SEE- OBVIOUSLY- THE FOCUS AREAS ARE IN VERY- URBAN AREAS IN OUR POPULATION CENTERS OF LOS ANGELES AND THE MORE GENERALLY SPEAKING IN THE SAN FRANCISCO AREA- ANOTHER REALLY IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE FINDINGS RELATED THE SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER STUDY. WAS THAT TYPES OF HATE GROUPS BASED ON THEIR IDEOLOGY AND IN HERE- YOU SEE ASIDE FROM. THIS GENERAL MONAKER- A LABEL- OF HATE ASSOCIATED WITH 30% OF OUR- THE INCIDENTS THAT THEY IDENTIFIED YOU SEE WHITE NATIONALISM WHICH- TOM HAS TALKED ABOUT HIS PRESENTATION- AND RACIST SKINHEADS AND NEO **** FORMING A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF THE KINDS OF- IDEOLOGICALLY MOTIVATED EXTREMISM. IN THE ACTUAL- CALIFORNIA AREA IN THEM BASED ON LOCATION- A SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF WHICH- IS BASED IN LOS ANGELES AT THIRTEEN AND A HALF PERCENT SO NOT INSIGNIFICANT- PERCENTAGE. AND THEN IF YOU LOOK AT THE- MAP HERE THAT YOU SEE IN FRONT OF USE THAT DELVES INTO SPECIFIC INCIDENTS BETWEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE- ASSOCIATED WITH WHITE SUPREMACY RELATED ACTIVITY. THE ANTI DEFAMATION LEAGUE FOUND THAT THERE WERE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO INCIDENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM WERE NONVIOLENT IN ORIENTATION THEY WERE PROPAGANDISTIC IN ORIENTATION THREE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE OUT OF THAT. THREE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO AND HERE AGAIN YOU SEE THIS IT MAPS- A DIFFERENT ORGANS. AND DEFINITE LEAGUE ALSO- THEIR FINDINGS. WITH THE SOUTHERN POVERTY CENTER HEATMAP REGARDING THEIR LOCATIONS OF ANTI HATE GROUPS IN CALIFORNIA IN OUR POPULATION CENTERS IN SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES. OKAY THE ANTI SEMITISM SEMITISM IN CALIFORNIA ALSO ADDED THAT THREE HUNDRED- PLUS CASES. NEARLY THREE OR FIFTY CASES A VERY SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF THOSE RELATED TO ANTI SEMITIC- RELATED INCIDENTS ACCORDING TO THE ANTI DEFAMATION LEAGUE IN THIS TEND TO BE AN AREA OF FOCUS OF WHITE SUPREMACIST GROUPS- AS WELL- IF THERE'S ANOTHER ORGANIZATION- THAT PRODUCED A REALLY INTERESTING HEATMAP AS WELL OF SEARCH TERMS. WAS TOM WAS TALKING ABOUT- THIS ON LIKE AN ACTIVITY IN THE ONLINE WORLD IN WHICH SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS- AND HABIT- ORGANIZATION BY NAME OF MOON SHOTS DEVIANT LOOK AT ESSENTIALLY THE TOP SEARCH TERMS IN CALIFORNIA- AND SOME OF THE SEARCH TERMS HERE RELATED ATTACK HATE ORIENTED SEARCH TERMS- ARE VERY MUCH IDENTIFIABLE- WITH NEO **** OR- WHITE SUPREMACIST ORGANIZATIONS FOURTEEN WORDS IS ASSOCIATE WHITE WHITE SUPREMACIST MOVEMENT. OBVIOUSLY SICK HEIL AND PHRASES LIKE THAT ASSOCIATED WITH NEO **** GROUPS THERE THERE ARE SO MANY TERMS HERE- SOME OF WHICH WERE JUST SO TOXIC I HAD TO ACTUALLY BLOCK OUT- BUT THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF- PEOPLE. USING ONLINE TOOLS TO TRY TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HATRED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY WE HAVE A NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT I'M PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT ONE GROUP OF THE I'M KNOWN AS THE RISE ABOVE MOVEMENT OPERATING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAS CARRIED OUT. A NUMBER OF MY OWN ACTIVITIES IN THE STATE- THEY ARE AN ORGANIZATION THAT WAS FOUNDED BY AN INDIVIDUAL BY THE NAME OF ROBERT RUN GO- HE WAS CHARGED WITH FEDERAL CRIMES IN THOSE CHARGES. WERE DISMISSED BUT THEN- HE WAS AGAIN RECENTLY RECHARGE FOR INVOLVEMENT IN RIOTS IN ACTUALLY INTERESTING THING ABOUT RUN THOUGH IS THAT HE HAS FLED OVERSEAS IN THE LAST REPORT I SAW IS THAT YOU MAY BE IN THE BALKANS. AND EUROPEAN LAW ENFORCEMENT IS TRYING TO FIND. HIM SO HE CAN BE SENT BACK TO CAL YEAH SO HE CAN BE- TRIED THE THING I WOULD SAY THAT I THINK IS REALLY. AND IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR CONVERSATION IS THAT GROUPS LIKE THE RISE ABOVE MOVEMENT HAVE LINKAGES OVERSEAS NOT ONLY IS RUN GO HAS THE FLIGHT OVERSEAS BUT BEFORE- HE REALLY BECAME WELL KNOWN HE WAS TRAVELING TO A TO UKRAINE TO ASSOCIATE WITH. A EUROPEAN BASED WHITE SUPREMACIST ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE AZOV BATTALION FOR INSTANCE- WHERE HE ACTUALLY ENGAGED THEN- BY CLUBS- IN AN MMA EVENTS WITH THIS ORGANIZATION. ANOTHER ORGANIZATION THAT'S REALLY CLOSE TO HOME- IS THIS GROUP KNOWN AS THE ATOMWAFFEN DIVISION IN. A NEO **** BASED GROUP. WORK ONE MEMBER OF THAT ORGANIZATION I'M AS YOU SEEN HERE MURDERED- YEAH CALIFORNIA ASSISTED BY THE NAME OF BLAZE BERNSTEINADAM OFTEN DIVISION CARRIED OUT A NUMBER OF ATTACKS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN. THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND ALSO IS AN ORGANIZATION THAT HAS OVERSEAS LINKAGES AS WELL AND IN FACT HAS SERVED AS THE INSPIRATION FOR THE CREATION OF A NUMBER OF- AUTUMN WAFFEN DIVISION AFFILIATE GROUPS BASED OVERSEAS- THROUGHOUT EUROPE- NOW THE BOOGALOO BOYS- TOMHAS. SPOKEN ABOUT BEFORE SO I'M GOING TO SKIP OVER THIS LIVE WERE AYE I MENTION- STEVEN CARILLO THE ALLEGED MURDER OF A FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. OFFICER OAKLAND ALSO CARRIED OUT A DEADLY ATTACK AGAINST. A DEPUTY SHERIFF IN SANTA CRUZ NOT FAR FROM FROM WHERE I LIVE- THAT IMPORTANT THING I THINK THE EMPHASIZING JUST UNDERSCORE WHAT TOM HAD SAID HERE IS THAT OF ALL THE GROUPS I AM ACTUALLY PERSONALLY CONCERNED ABOUT IT'S THE ANTI GOVERNMENT GROUPS LIKE THE BLUE BLAZE- AS THEY POSE A THREAT DIRECTLY TO. THOSE WHO ARE WORKING FOR STATE FEDERAL OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL OFFICES THEY ARE I'M ANTI POLICE FOR INSTANCE TO THE CORE- AND THEY'RE ALSO- IN THE SLIGHTEST SPEAKS ABOUT SOME OF THE WAYS IN WHICH- CORREOS ACTIVITIES WERE IDENTIFIED. LARGELY THROUGH HIS COMMUNICATION OVER SOCIAL MEDIA WHICH IS AGAIN TO UNDERSCORE A POINT TOM HAD MADE BUT ALSO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION- THAT CAREER DID NOT OPERATE IN ISOLATION- HE HAS BEEN NOW SINCE LINKS TO A GROUP CALLED THE GRISLY SCOUTS WHICH IS A CALIFORNIA BASED MILITIA GROUP BASED AN- INTERLOCAL FORTY ABOUT A HUNDRED MILES FROM SAN FRANCISCO- AND THERE HAVE BEEN SOME. ARRESTS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK- ASSOCIATED WITH CARILLO- AS RECENTLY AS LAST LAST MONTH BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SO AGAIN- THE THREAT POSED BY INDIVIDUALS LIKE CARILLO- HAS HAS NOT WANED- WE'RE STILL FINDING INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE PART OF THIS ANTI GOVERNMENT MILIEU WHO. POSE A THREAT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. NOW IN TERMS OF PAUL RECOMMENDATIONS- ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT. RECOMMENDATIONS I THINK I COULD PROVIDE- TO YOU IS AND I THINK THIS UNDERSCORES AGAIN TOM'S POINT. THE NEED TO CONSIDER USING- ADDITIONAL MEASURES TO- SURVEIL AS APPROPRIATE AND PURSUANT TO THE LAW INDIVIDUALS ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THE TYPES OF GROUPS I DESCRIBED TODAY- IT IF YOU GO BACK TO SOME OF THOSE EARLIER MAPS IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF TROOPS THAT WE NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT- IT IS A- SIGNIFICANT. CHALLENGE BUT ONE RECOMMENDATION THAT MAY BE PRACTICAL IS ALSO CONSIDERING- THE EXPANSION OF THE HERTZBERG- OUR TIME CALIFORNIA PREVENTION TERRORISM ACT- JUST AS TOM DESCRIBED THE FACT THAT. IN THE UNITED STATES WE DON'T HAVE A DOMESTIC TERRORISM STATUTE FEDERALLY A LOT OF STATES DON'T HAVE SUFFICIENT LAWS TO TACKLE THE THREAT DOMESTIC TERRORISM. CALIFORNIA'S BETTER THE MANY- BUT STILL CAN DO BETTER. REALLY I WOULD BRING YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS SECOND BULLET POINTS HERE- WHERE THE LAW AS IT EXISTS TODAY ONLY PROHIBITS THE USE OF THE THREATS. OR USE OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION- WHICH CAN INCLUDE INCENDIARY DEVICES SO IT IS PRETTY NARROW IT WOULDN'T COVER- ACTS OF VIOLENCE RELATED TO TERRORISM- THAT MAY FOR INSTANCE USE SMALL ARMS AND I SEE THAT AS A GAP THAT COULD BE LEGISLATIVE REALLY REMEDY- THE LAST THING I'LL SAY- IS. I DO BELIEVE- EMERGENCY RESPONDERS FIREFIGHTERS EMTS LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT REMAIN AT HIGH RISK OF AMBUSH ATTACKS THEY REALLY DO NEED ADDITIONAL TRAINING BY THE STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT SO THEY CAN BE BETTER PREPARED IF THEY ARE PUT IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY COULD FACE. AN AMBUSH ATTACK AND I THINK ONE WAY TO DO THIS COULD BE A MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS AND REQUEST EMERGENCY RESPONDERS TO WEAR TACTICAL DEFENSE GEAR. AT LEAST IN VERY SPECIFIC KINDS OF SITUATIONS AND PLACES LIKE LAKELAND FLORIDA- YOU HAVE SEEN WHERE YOU HAVE. THAT THANKFULLY THOSE. FIREFIGHTERS IN LAKELAND HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PURCHASE FOR INSTANCE SIXTEEN BALLISTIC VESTS- THROUGH A FIREHOUSE SUBS PUBLIC SAFETY FOUNDATION BRAND I THINK THAT THAT GOES A LONG WAY TO PROTECTING. OUR EMERGENCY RESPONDERS AND THOSE WHO ARE ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF KEEPING US SAFE- I'LL SKIP OVER THESE LAST FEW FLIGHTS BECAUSE I WANT TO HAVE TIME FOR. FOR QUESTIONS I'LL JUST END BY SAYING THAT- I PROVIDED THE POWER POINT TO YOUR STAFF MEMBERS AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO SHARE- THIS VERSION THAT ALSO INCLUDES CITATIONS THAT MAY BE HELPFUL AND WITH THAT I'LL POLICY. HERE AND- WOULD LOVE TO HEAR YOUR YOUR QUESTIONS. WELL THANK YOU ARE. THANK YOU TO FOR YOU TESTING PART. NOW WILL IT UP BACK TO. THE COMMITTEE FOR PROBABLY SOME QUESTION BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS ONE THING I JUST WANTED A- REALLY- THANK YOU FOR THAT LAST PART OF PARTICIPATION REGARDING OR- A REGARDING THE YOU USE THE BALLISTIC GEAR FOR FIRST RESPONDERS OUT SO. VERY CRITICAL NOWADAYS- MORE THAN EVER THEY NOT ONLY MYSELF BUT VICE CHAIR KELLY CAN TALK ABOUT THE NEED FOR THAT BEING WHERE WE CAME FROM AND- EMS AND- DEALING WITH A LOT OF ISSUES OUT THERE IN IN OUR COMMUNITIES. ALSO WITHOUT SAID- WE TALKED ABOUT THE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA ON THE INTERNET. ATTORNEY UNIQUE THREE THREATS TO CALIFORNIA REGARDING THAT AND IF SO WHAT ARE WE DOING TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. SO I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE THE FIRST STAB AT AT THIS PARTICULAR QUESTION AND ONE OF THE ROLES I HAVE AT THE MIDDLEBURY INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES AT THAT CENTER ON TEARS OF EXTREMISM AND COUNTERTERRORISM FOR US IS TO. PARTNER WITH SILICON VALLEY COMPANIES- TO PROVIDE THEM ASSISTANCE REGARDING WAYS IN WHICH EXTREMISTS ARE USING THEIR PLATFORMS. TO PROPAGATE MESSAGES RELATED TO HATE AND SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFY- MATERIAL THAT MAY VIOLATE THEIR COMMUNITY AND SAFETY GUIDELINES AND MATERIAL THAT. MAY WELL ACTUALLY- TARGET SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS FOR ACTS OF VIOLENCE IN IN TARGETING SPECIFIC PROTECTIVE FEDERAL GROUPS AS WELL. AND IN THIS SENSE- I THINK. MOST OF US WOULD AGREE I THINK THAT SILICON VALLEY- COMPANIES WHETHER IT'S- FACEBOOK TWITTER. GOOGLE YOUTUBE ALL OF THEM CAN STILL DO MUCH BETTER IN THE CONTEXT OF ENSURING THAT THEIR PLATFORMS ARE ABUSED BY. BAD ACTORS IN THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS OVER TIME GOOD PRESS REPORTS ABOUT HOW IN FACT. ALGORITHMS HAVE BEEN USED TO RECOMMEND- A NEW FACEBOOK PAGE TO FOLLOW A NEW- YOUTUBE VIDEO TO WATCH I'M A NEW PERSON TO FOLLOW OVER TWITTER. THAT COULD LEAD ONE DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE OF RADICALIZATION SO. ONE THING I THINK THAT COULD BE USEFUL- IS TO CONTINUE TO EVALUATE HOW ALGORITHMS MAY BE USED BY SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES TO INFLAME INDIVIDUALS TO RADICALIZE INDIVIDUALS. AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES HAVE ONE BILL THAT'S BEEN INTRODUCED- TO TRY TO DO BETTER IN TERMS OF THAT. CONCEPT OF ALGORITHMIC RADICALIZATION THAT IS A THREAT BUT I ALSO THINK THE STATE HAS A ROLE TO PLAY AS WELL. IN ENSURING THAT THESE- AT LARGE TECH COMPANIES DO DO THEIR PART IN ENSURING THAT THE PLATFORMS. ARE BEING ABUSED BY A BAD ACTOR SO I DO THE ISSUE OF ALGAL. IS A REALLY IMPORTANT WHAT. HI THANK YOU- ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR MOVE ON TO THE NEXT FROM. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLERIA QUESTION. FROM YOU HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS SO. DO WE DO WE NEED TO MAKE SOME KIND OF DISTINCTION BETWEEN WHAT MIGHT BE. FRINGE VIEWPOINTS IN SOCIETY. AND DOMESTIC TERRORISM- AND ALL AND ALL OF. YEAH I MEAN THEY SEEM TO BE A BIG FOCUS ON FOR EXAMPLE LIKE Q. ANON RIGHT WHICH IS. CERTAINLY A CONSPIRACY THEORY. YOU KNOW- THE GOES AROUND TO DIFFERENT GROUPS BUT ISN'T NECESSARILY LINKED TO ANY KIND OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM IN ITSELF- AND JUST LIKE I MEAN FOR INSTANCE I'LL DO ANOTHER KNOWLEDGE I MEAN A LOT OF PEOPLE OF ISLAMIC FAITH BUT WE CERTAINLY DON'T. A TRIBUTE ALL OF THEM TO THE FUNDAMENTALISTS WHO MIGHT CARRY OUT TERRORIST ATTACKS LIKE IN SAND SAMPOERNA DINO- MY NAME IF YOU WILL HAVE VERY FUNDAMENTALIST RELIGIOUS VIEWS. BUT THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY LEAD TO ARE NOT ENGAGING IN VIOLENCE- OR IN CARRYING OUT ATTACKS- EVEN OUT THIS SUMMER- YOU KNOW A LOT OF. PROTESTS REGARDING THE- MURDER OF GEORGE FLOYD- AND I THINK WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE SALAS A CO OPTION OF SOME OF THE VERY PEACEFUL PROTEST FOR THE MOST PART. BY MORE FRINGE GROUPS- I. YOU KNOW THAT CARRIED OUT ATTACKS BATTERIES TWO PEOPLE WERE KILLED- DURING SOME OF THOSE PROTESTS NATIONWIDE- IS THERE A DISTINCTION THERE AND MAYBE TO THAT SPECIFIC QUESTION THIS SUMMER DO I DIDN'T HEAR MUCH ON THIS POINT BUT- I BELIEVE WAS MR O'CONNOR POINTED OUT THERE'S THE UNDER THE CAMOUFLAGE OF PROTEST. SOME OF THESE GROUPS ARE KIND OF INFILTRATING PROTESTS AND CARRYING OUT- YOU KNOW TERRORIST ATTACKS. DO WE FIND OUT THAT THERE WERE SOME GROUPS INVOLVED WITH SAY EXAMPLE THAT THE PROTEST WE SAW THIS SUMMER WHERE I THINK FROM A LOT OF THE MEDIA REPORTS. VERY MUCH PEACEFUL PROTEST OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE FRUSTRATED AND ANGRY. BUT WE'RE NOT CARRYING OUT ANY KIND OF ATTACKS BUT THEN THERE WERE OBVIOUSLY GROUPS IN THERE THAT WERE IN FACT DOING THAT- DID WE FIND OUT THAT THERE WERE CERTAIN GROUPS RESPONSIBLE. OR THEY WERE HELPING ORGANIZE THAT- BECAUSE I THINK THERE IS KIND OF A DISTINCTION AND WE TEND TO KIND OF HIT THESE THINGS WITH A BROAD BRUSH. AND THAT CAN BE. PROBLEMATIC I THINK MEANS SO MAYBE JUST SPEAK TO THAT ISSUE. IF I IF I CAN JUMP BY MEDITATION- I APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION BECAUSE IT IS SPOT ON RIGHT- IN THE BEGINNING OF THE POWER POINT PRESENTATION I TALK ABOUT THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT HOW THE FIRST MOMENT WINS OUT IN IN- ANY DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AND WHEN IT COMES TO INVESTIGATIONS- SO IT IT IT IS NOT THE- ACTIVITY THAT THE PROTEST AS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT DRAWS INVESTIGATION. INTO THE VIOLENCE AND THAT IS- IF THAT IS THE EXTREME VIOLENCE RIGHT SO WE'RE TALKING WHEN I MENTIONED- UNDER THE COVER OF THE PROTESTS THAT WAS IN REGARDS TO THE BOOGALOO BOYS WHO KILLED A FEDERAL PROTECTIVE OFFICER AT THE OAKLAND COURTHOUSE- JUST A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY FROM A BLACK LIVES MATTER RALLY. IN THEIR INTENT WAS TO BLAME THAT KILLING AND THE BLACK LIVES MATTER GROUP THAT WAS THERE THERE IT'S SOLE PURPOSE WITH IT TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THAT'S HOW WITH A WHO WAS DONE BY- SO UNDER THE COVER OF PROTESTS THEY USED A- A MURDER- TO TRY AND- PUT IT BACK ON AND- THE OTHER PEOPLE- SO IT TRULY IS THE VIOLENT ACTIONS AS YOU SAID. Q. ANON HAS HAD- I MEAN IT'S A CONSPIRACY THEORY THERE'S THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO FOLLOW IT IF THE PEOPLE WHO WILL SHOW UP IN WASHINGTON DC AND FIRE OFF A RIFLE INSIDE A COMET PIZZA BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THE CONSPIRACY THEORY THAT THERE ARE CHILDREN BEING HELD IN THE BASEMENT THERE BY. DEMOCRATS AND- YOU KNOW WOULD BE PARTICULARLY- HILLARY CLINTON AND- PROTEST- IN THEIR EMAILS THEY THAT THEY CO NO. QUIETLY SAID THAT THERE WERE CHILDREN IN THE BAY PLACE THE- THEORIES IN THE QUEUE DRAW WILL THIS TO DRIVE FROM. UP TO ONE THE FIRE OFF A GUN. OF THE- COM PIZZA SO THERE HAVE- THE VINYL IS WHY NEEDS TO BE. LOOKED THAT- IT'S NOT THE IDEA. IT NOT THE- THEORY- THOSE ARE THINGS THAT CAN. TO A- BUT I STATED IT THE VIOLENCE THE LAW ENFORCED NEED TO LOOK AT- A IN YOUR CAN HAVE. DIFFERENT YOU. HOLD CAN. THEORIES AND THAT'S FINE IT'S YOU USE THAT- STEP OUT INTO BY. BETTER BECAUSE- A LAW ENFORCED ISSUE YEAH THAT THAT WAS ALL OF THE- I THINK YOU SAID THE ACTUALLY AL-QAEDA'S IN. ISLAMIC STATE HAVE SAID IN THEIR- IN A LOT OF THEIR STUFF- ONLINE- PROPAGANDA THAT THEY ARE USING. THE CAMOUFLAGE OF PROTEST. AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THESE THINGS AND I WOULD ALSO SAY ISN'T THIS A COMMON TACTIC ALSO OF ANTIFA. TO USE THE CAMOUFLAGE OF PROTEST TO DO EXACTLY THE THINGS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. SO PUBLISHER OF THE JASON BECAUSE I DIDN'T MENTION ALL KIND OF OR- OKAY MAYBE THAT WE CHASE AND SARIA. IT WAS ONE OF THE TWO BALD GUYS SO- THAT WAS THAT WAS DEFINITELY ME- AND ACTUALLY IN THE PUBLICATIONS THEY DO ENCOURAGE- INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY BE SUPPORT OF THE AL QAEDA OR ISIS MESSAGE. TO LEVERAGE PROTESTS AND IT LEVERAGING PROTEST WHETHER IT'S LEFT WING RIGHT WING OF RELIGIOUSLY MOTIVATED TERRORIST YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE BAD ACTORS WHO MAY BE- SEEING THAT PROTESTS THAT COULD BE A LEGITIMATE PROTESTS- A WHEN TOM HAD THE SLIGHT ABOUT PEOPLE YELLING AND- AND RAISING YOUR VOICES TO PROTEST THAT'S COMPLETELY. UNACCEPTABLE THIS IS THE UNITED STATES BUT THERE ARE THOSE INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE AND IT DOESN'T MATTER THE KIND OF GROUP- IT DATE THANK YOU WANT TO INFILTRATE AND TOM. REFERENCED A LOCAL- THE BILLABLE A RELATED ATTACK IN AND THAT WAS A ONE AT THAT I THINK CAN US ALL CLOSED AT THE HOME BECAUSE THAT WAS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT ONE OF. THE OTHER ONES I REMEMBER VERY VIVIDLY I AM NOT LONG BEFORE THAT WAS IN IN VEGAS- AND ANOTHER BML BLM PROTESTS- IN WHICH A FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT INTERCEPTED TWO ARE ACTUALLY THREE MEMBERS OF THE BLUE BOYS WHO ARE PLAYING- AND ATTACK THEIR ALSO TOOK TO USE MOLOTOV. COCKTAILS AND THEN WE DOOFFER CALL IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST- SO THE WITH THE FIRST I THINK THAT'S A TYPICALLY- IT SHOULD BE A BIT- TRIBBLE GAP TO AN INDIVIDUAL WHO SELF IDENTIFY AS- ANTIFA CARRIED OUT- A SHOOTING AT A PROTEST- KILLING A MEMBER. OF IN A ORGANIZATION I THINK WITH COMPATRIOT FIRST OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO- THAT WAS A- A LEFT WING- INCIDENTS THAT I CAN RECALL AS WELL SO. I AM MY POINT IS IT DOESN'T MATTER- THE IDEOLOGY YOU'LL FIND BAD ACTORS WHO ARE GOING TO BE PRONE TO VIOLENCE TRYING TO LEVERAGE THESE PROTESTS. TO FURTHER THEIR OWN AGENDA WHICH IS QUITE OFTEN VERY. SEPARATE FROM THE ACTUAL PROTEST ITSELF. YOU CAN IN MY LIFE QUESTION OR OF. WE ARE STILL SITTING THE STATE. AND OUR CAPITAL IS BARRICADED OFF TO THIS DAY- SINCE THE NATIONAL THREAT- THAT WAS THOUGHT TO BE ON THE STATE CAPITAL I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS ARE FAMILIAR WITH THIS BUT ASK YOU TO SPEAK WITH IT. IF YOU HAVE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT IT WHAT WAS THE ULTIMATE THREAT- TO THE STATE CAPITOL THAT WARRANTED. NATIONAL GUARD BEING BROUGHT IN- THE BARRICADES THAT ARE STILL UP- TO THIS DAY. IS THERE IS THERE ANY EXISTING THREAT AND WHAT WAS THE ACTUAL THREAT LEADING UP TO. THE DAY THAT WE YOU KNOW HAD THESE BARRICADES AND HAD. NATIONAL GUARD HERE. YOU EVER TO ASCERTAIN. WHAT GROUPS WERE ACTUALLY GOING TO DO ANYTHING. ON THAT DAY AND WHO ACT AND MAYBE WHO ACTUALLY DID ANYTHING. ON ON THAT DATE THAT WE THAT WE ARE SORT OF BARRICADED UP FOR. HI I GUESS I CAN JUMP ON THE FIRST PART OF THAT- SO THE INTELLIGENCE- THAT WAS- GATHERED AND PUBLICLY- TALK ABOUT WAS- A KIND OF A GENERAL TO- STATE CAPITALS NOT SPECIFICALLY CALIFORNIA'S STATE CAPITAL BUT K. STATE CAPITALS AND A FOLLOW ON. AS THE U. S. CAPITOL HAVE BEEN LOCKED DOWN THAT THE- THE CHATTER ONLINE WAS TO GO TO THE STATE CAPITOL- THIS LAST- SECURED- YOU KNOW THEN THE U. S. CAPITOL WAS AT THE TIME AND IS- SO THAT THAT WAS THE THREAT- YEAH I RETIRED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- FROM THE F. B. I. SO I DON'T HAVE THE- THE DAILY BRIEFINGS ON WHAT THE THREAT WAS- IT CURRENTLY IS NOW AND I WOULDN'T VENTURE TO WHAT. TO SAY. OR WHAT IT WAS GONNA BE- AMERICA TO MAKE SOME UP FOR YOU. OKAY I'M- OKAY I THINK UN VICE CHAIR KELLY SAID A QUESTION I IF YOU BOTH OF- YOU FOR YOUR UPDATE ON THAT. YEAH THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN GOING ON A LONG TIME THAT'S BEEN GOING ON EVER SINCE I WAS THE FIRST INTO THE FIRE SERVICE THIRTY FIVE NOW FORTY YEARS AGO. AND IT JUST SEEMS THAT ONE GROUP DISAPPEARS IN ANOTHER GROUP TAKES ITS PLACE AND I THINK THE MOST EFFECTIVE THING THAT HAS BEEN DONE OVER THE YEARS IS TO FOR THE MOST PART- KEEP THE GENIES IN THE BOTTLE AND NOT LET THEM OUT AND EAT OUT NOW WE HAVE. MORE OF A PROLIFERATION OF YOU KNOW BASICALLY PUTTING IT OUT THERE AND MAKING IT. THIS THAT THESE PEOPLE GET PUBLICITY. AND THAT PUBLICITY IS SOMETHING THAT THEY FEED ON. AND YEAH YOU KNOW I THINK THE EFFORTS USED TO BE HEY. YOU KNOW WE WORK QUIETLY BEHIND THE SCENES TO KEEP THEM IN THE BOTTLE. AND NW EVERYBODY WANTS TO HAVE IT OUT AND I THINK WITH WITH OUR SOCIAL MEDIA AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING. FROM A PUBLIC POLICY PERSPECTIVE. IT YOU KNOW HOW DO WE HOW DO WE GO ABOUT DOING THAT KEEP IN THAT. YOU KNOW KEEP IT WOULD GET YOU'RE NOT GOING TO. YOU CAN'T FIX SOME OF THESE MINDS OF PEOPLE WHO HATE. BUT YOU CAN CERTAINLY KEEP THEM- DISCOURAGED FROM ACTING OUT ON IT. AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK THE BIG THE BIG POLICY ISSUES ARE IS HOW DO WE HOW DO WE- GOVERN SO THAT. YOU KNOW PEOPLE DON'T. AREN'T ENCOURAGED TO ACT OUT. BECAUSE WE SEEM TO BE HAVING A LOT OF THAT. J. SURVIVING JUMP AND JUST QUICKLY- AND THEN PASSED OFF TO YOU ON THIS ONE- THE JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCES THAT ARE SET UP ACROSS THE UNITED STATES FIFTY SIX FIELD OFFICES ALL HAVE JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCES. THEY'RE MADE UP OF STATE LOCAL AND EDERAL AGENCIES- THEY ARE WORKING DAY AND NIGHT- PUTTING DOWN THREATS THAT ARE COMING IN AT A AT A RATE WHICH WOULD BE ALARMING FOR ANYONE WHO WAS NOT IN THAT- IN THAT MISSION SETS SO- THEY ARE DOING BE QUIET WORK BEHIND THE SCENES- TO. TO TAKE DOWN THESE INDIVIDUAL ACTORS GET IN FRONT OF THE VIOLENCE AND YOU DON'T ALWAYS SEE ABOUT IT YOU DON'T ALWAYS HEAR ABOUT IT- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WHEN WE DO HAVE AN ACTUAL. EVENT THAT TAKES PLACE THAT- THAT THE PERSON'S THE PERSONS WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES WHICH MEET THE DEFINITION OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM I THINK IT WOULD IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE VICTIMS- THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT JUST CALLED DOMESTIC TERRORISTS BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHARGE THEM FEDERALLY AS DOMESTIC TERRORISTS- AND THAT WOULD BE ADDING IT A PENALTY TO THAT PAIN- MUCH LIKE. THE HATE CRIMES- HATE CRIMES HAVE HAVE THE ABILITY- IF AN EVENT TAKES PLACE THAT FEELS THE DEFINITION OF A HATE CRIME IT ALSO FULFILLS ASSAULTS AND HOMICIDES THESE TYPE OF THINGS BUT WE CALL THEM HATE CRIMES WE CHARGE THEM AND HATE CRIMES BECAUSE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT'LL DO IS LET THE VICTIMS THE VICTIMS FAMILIES KNOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS TAKING THAT SERIOUSLY- IT IS NOT JUST VIOLENCE IS VIOLENCE FOR A POLITICAL PURPOSE. IN IN THE UNITED STATES THAT'S SOMETHING WE REALLY CAN'T TOLERATE SO WE HAVE AN EVENT THAT MEETS THAT DEFINITION I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE- HAVE THE ABILITY TO RAISE TWO THAT I THINK- TO THE CHARGE THAT PERSON WITH THAT- SO WE CAN TRACK IT BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. YOU CAN LOOK DOWN THE LIST. THAT I JUST GO ONLINE AND FIND THE NO BROKE INTERNET TERROR EVENTS HAVE TAKEN TONIGHT. IF YOU LOOK UP. TERRORISM YOUR NOT GOING TO. A AND- LIST AT ALL BECAUSE- YOU HAVE TO LOOK UP EVERY ASSAULT EVERY HOMICIDE NC BACK TO MY PRESENTATION IF THAT NUMBER TWO WHAT IS THE PURPOSE WHY DID THIS PERSON DO THIS TO INTIMIDATE OR COERCE A CIVILIAN POPULATION. OR TO INFLUENCE THE POLICY OF THE GOVERNMENT. SO I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE MAKING MARTYRS OUT OF PEOPLE- FOUR FOUR CASES THAT THAT DON'T REALLY RISE TO THAT- DEFINITION. BUT WHEN IT DOES WE NEED TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY AND THAT EVEN OF ITSELF CAN ALSO NOT ONLY WILL IT HELP TRACK. WOULD HELP THE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES BUT IT WILL ALSO. BE A DETERRENT- YOU YOU MAY NOT SPEED DOWN THE HIGHWAY BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO GET A TICKET FOR GOING OVER THAT SPEED LIMIT- PEOPLE MAY NOT STEP OUT INTO THAT VIOLENCE IF THEY KNOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS TAKING IT SERIOUSLY. LIKE WE DO MANY OTHER ARE CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS. RIGHT SO WHAT I'M HEARING FROM YOU ON THIS IS WE NEED TO CONTINUE. TO ENSURE THAT THE AGENCIES. CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR JOB AND HAVE THE RESOURCES. AND THE TO DO THAT JOB. 101% AND- YOU RECENTLY SAW- THE ATTORNEY GENERAL UNITED STATES COME OUT AND ASK FOR FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE F. B. I.'S DOMESTIC TERRORISM- INVESTIGATIONS AND ANOTHER FORTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE U. S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO PROSECUTE THE INCREASE IN DOMESTIC TERRORISM CASES WHICH WE'VE SEEN OVERALL- BEFORE JANUARY SIX- THE JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCES IS THE CONDUIT FOR STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES TO WORK COUNTERTERRORISM. I PERSONALLY. NO BECAUSE I WORKED ON A JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCE FOR TWENTY THREE YEARS THAT THAT REALLY IS A SYSTEM THAT WORKS INVOLVING SMALL AGENCIES LARGER LOCAL AGENCIES STATE AGENCIES FBI AGENTS UGH I MAY SHOW UP IN TO- LOS ANGELES I DON'T KNOW LOS ANGELES THE POLICE OFFICERS THERE TO THE STATE OFFICERS DO WORKING HAND IN HAND. TO FIGHT A DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM IS THE ONLY WAY IT WORKS IT IS A JOINT OPERATION AND IN THAT IT NEEDS TO BE SUPPORTED- AND- AND HAVE THE- TOOLS NECESSARY TO DO THAT ONE OF THOSE WOULD BE A PENALTY ATTACHED TO THE ACTUAL DEFINITION OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM RIGHT ANY OTHER ONE I HEARD WAS THE DETERRENCE. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO DETER NOT REWARD- FOR THAT TYPE OF BEHAVIOR TO IN ORDER TO DISCOURAGE IT SO THAT'S ALL I HAVE. FOR YOU GUYS THANK YOU SO MUCH APPRECIATED. THANK YOU I KNOW I THINK WE HAVE SUMMER I'M OF. CALLED IN NORTH HADN'T QUITE BEFORE ON TO THE SECOND POWER. MISTER CHAIR CAN YOU HEAR ME. OKAY HERE JUST IN AWE CERNER IF YOU HAD A QUESTION BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT TOWN I DID. JUST TAKE JUST A QUICK ONE I KNOW YOU WANT TO MOVE ON HERE BUT CAN I JUST THANK YOU FIRST FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING IN ALLOWING ME TO BE INCLUDED ALONG WITH I THINK MY COLLEAGUES FROM. ORANGE COUNTY CENTER- BURKE WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITTEES ATTEND TO THE ISSUE- I JUST WANTED TO I WANTED TO YEP ONE QUESTION WITH YOUR PANEL HERE IF THAT'S ALRIGHT MR CHER. YES THAT'S FINE BUT- OKAY- REALLY APPRECIATE THE OVERVIEW- WE DIDN'T REALLY TOUCH OUR WEEK YOUR RETIREMENT PENALTIES RETIREMENT DETERRENCE- I DON'T. QUESTIONS BUT JUST OVERALL CAPACITY. THE JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCE THAT YOU ARE MENTIONED WAS SUCCESSFUL IN DISRUPTING- THAT- A TERRORIST PLOT- FROM A CONSTITUENT OF MINE IN RECEIPT OF. A FORMER INFANTRYMAN MARC STEVEN TO MAKE GO BACK IN TWENTY NINETEEN WHO CAME BACK FROM AFGHANISTAN IN COMBAT AND- THANKS TO THE WORK IN COORDINATION BETWEEN THE FBI. AND LAPD LA SHERIFF'S- LONG BEACH PD- AS WELL AS ADAM OUR STATE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES IF YOU WERE ABLE TO GET- A CONFIDENTIAL- I FORGET THERE'S A CHARM CHS I THINK BUT IT'S A- BAIT AND- UNDER COVER SOMEONE WAS ABLE TO IT TO GET TO THIS PERSON AND SUPPLY THEM WITH THE INERT HE D. THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE USING TO BLOW UP A FREEWAY. AS WELL AS A APPROACH AT A RALLY OUTSIDE OF A DEMOCRATIC MEMBER OF CONGRESS IS OFFICE- YOU KNOW AND WE- WE WEREN'T THAT SUCCESSFUL. IN A FEW INCIDENTS. I LOST. A FRIEND IN POWAY- AND- WE AT THE BORDERLINE SHOOTING IN MY DISTRICT TO WHERE TWELVE PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN A COUNTRY MUSIC FAR. FROM THE- THE VETERAN WHO WOULD. HANDLE A LOT OF TRAUMA AND- A LOT OF WARNING SIGNS IN FIFTY ONE FIFTIES THAT'D BEEN SORT OF RECYCLE THAT THROUGH THE SYSTEM I MEAN KEPT COMING BACK. BUT I. I MENTIONED YOU KNOW THAT THE- INTERMINGLE CASE. BECAUSE IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT IN OUR DISTRICT- AND RIGHT NOW COMMUNITIES IN PLACES YOU WOULDN'T THINK A RECEIPT CALIFORNIA. KIND OF AMERICANA MIDDLE CLASS VERY DIVERSE% COMMUNITY THAT IS TO BE POSSIBLE- ACTUALLY BABBITT IS FROM VENTURA COUNTY WAS KILLED IN THE CAPITAL INCIDENT- AND- YOU KNOW. I'M MY BIGGEST CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS CAPACITY I THINK THE HUMAN INTELLIGENCE SIDE OF THIS EQUATION IS REALLY WHAT. WILL MOLLIFY THOSE WHO MAY BE CONCERNED ON THE RIGHT OR THE LEFT BACK TO BROAD BRUSHES ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER POINTED OUT YOU DON'T WANT TO CAST TOO WIDE OF A NET OR CRIMINALIZE SPEECH- I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THAT AND- THE ISSUE THOUGH IS THAT IF THERE. ARE PEOPLE TO CONNECT THE DOTS WE DON'T OF THE HUMAN RESOURCES OUT IN THE FIELD TO DO THIS KIND OF ON THE GROUND WORK. AND WE'RE NOT LEAVE OURSELVES VULNERABLE. AND I MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTUALLY CUT FUNDING TO THE FUSION CENTERS- OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS SO THAT CAPACITY IS NOT WHAT IT WAS SAY DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. AND HOMELAND SECURITY AT THE STATE IS ACTUALLY TO STEP UP AND CAN SUBSIDIZE. I'VE BEEN BACK FILL SOME OF THAT FUNDING. DO YOU DO YOU SEE A NEED ON THE CAPACITY SIDE IN ADDITION TO PENALTIES AND LEGAL CHANGES. TO ACTUALLY SEE THAT I NEED I THINK THE STATE FEDERAL OR LOCAL LEVEL FOR AUGMENTATION- ON THE ON THE BUDGET SIDE OF THINGS. TO IMPROVE THIS COORDINATION OR BUILD CAPACITY I'M I JUST WONDER IF YOU COULD COMMENT ON THAT. I'LL I'LL JUMP BY MAGIC GAME SORRY JASON BUT- BUT YOU'RE I THINK YOU'RE SPOT ON ALSO THAT THE JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCES OUR WORD IF THAT REALLY IS WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD WHERE THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE DONE. IN YOUR DISTRICT IN ALL THE DISTRICTS ACROSS- CALIFORNIA. AND AS AS WE AFTER NINE ELEVEN WE- SURGED TOWARDS INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM CORRECTLY- YOU KNOW THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON NINE ELEVEN AND THAT WAS DEFINITELY THE THING THAT THE FBI HAD TO PLUS UP THE JOINT TERRORISM HAD THE PLOTS UP- DOMESTIC TERRORISM. AND ANYBODY WHO'S WORKED- DOMESTIC CARE OR ANY TYPE OF COUNTERTERRORISM MISSION WILL TELL YOU THAT DOMESTIC TERRORISM HAS BEEN THE SECOND TIER. LEVEL OF COUNTERTERRORISM I'M LITERALLY I WORKED THERE FOR TWENTY THREE YEARS AND- TAUGHT ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN DOMESTIC TERRORISM AND MANY TIMES PEOPLE AFTER PRESENTATION ON DOMESTIC THERE THAN THEY SAY. THAT'S GREAT STUFF I WERE COUNTER- THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING I MIGHT I WORK COUNTERTERRORISM ALSO RIGHT I MEAN IT'S- SO- NOW WE'RE SEEING THE RISE IN DOMESTIC. TERRORISM OVER THE PAST- YOU KNOW. SEVEN EIGHT- PAYER- NO IS THE FBI ABLE TO TAKE- WITH THE SAME NUMBER OF PEOPLE- TAKE TO ADDRESS THAT THAT- THE THREAT OF DOMESTIC BECAUSE- AS JASON SAID THE THREAT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM OR IDEOLOGICALLY DRIVEN INTERNATIONAL- THREAT ACTORS. IS HAS NOT GONE AWAY. RIGHT SO NOW YOU HAVE THE SAME NUMBER OF AGENTS ARE WORKING THAT- AND I ARE BOTH SIDES THAT NEED TO BE WORK EQUALLY- SO I THINK- THE PLUS UP WILL DEFINITELY HAVE TO COME IN. AND NUMBER OF AGENTS- IT'LL ALSO BE- IN THE YOU KNOW THE NUMBER BECAUSE A TASK FORCE OFFICER. IS ACROSS THE BOARD EQUAL TO AN AGENT ON THAT JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCE FOR THE INTELLIGENCE FOR THEIR- ARE YOU KNOW ALL POWERS OF ARREST EVERYTHING.

SO MUCH STOP FOR A SECOND A TURN OVER TO TOM OSBORNE- TOM IS THE MY DEPUTY- WHO OVERSEES THE DAILY OPERATIONS OF OUR HOMELAND SECURITY DIRECTORATE IT'S GOING TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE CONTEXT ON. SOME OF THE OPERATIONAL ASPECTS OF WHAT WE DO. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU DIRECTOR AND GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF. THE COMMITTEE. AND THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE HOMELAND SECURITY DIVISION HERE- THAT- YES AS THE DIRECTOR SAID. PRIOR TO MY CURRENT POSITION HERE AT ALL YES I SPENT NEARLY TWENTY FOUR YEARS WITH THE FBI. PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT ISSUES THAT INCLUDE THE INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC TERRORISM THREATS. COUNTERINTELLIGENCE THREATS AND OUR CYBER THREAT SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ON THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE EXTREMISM THREAD ISSUE AND HOW WE CAN BETTER PROTECT THE CITIZENS- UP CALIFORNIA. FIRST I'D LIKE TO DESCRIBE OUR CALIFORNIA STATE WIDE THREAT ASSESSMENT PROCESS. WHICH LARGELY MIRRORS THE F. B. I.'S. THREAT REVIEW AND PRIORITIZATION PROCESS WHICH THEY REFER TO AS THE TRPV FOUR ON AN ANNUAL BASIS ARE THREATS ARE EXAMINED AND RESOURCES ARE PRIORITIZED BASED UPON- THOSE THREATS- AND SO THIS. PROCESS MY PROCESS IT'S DONE ANNUALLY BY THE STATE ASSESSMENT CENTER OR THE STACK IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE STATE'S HOUSING ALL OF OUR FUSION CENTERS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED AND THEN SECONDLY I WILL PROVIDE A SUMMARY OF OUR CURRENT THREAT ENVIRONMENT BASED UPON THIS METHODOLOGY. THE CALIFORNIA STATEWIDE THREAT ASSESSMENT REPORT VIEWS THE THREAT LANDSCAPE OF CALIFORNIA IN THREE CATEGORIES CRIMINAL CYBER AND EXTREMISM WE FORMALLY USED TO BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE TERRORISM. THE DOUBLE MENTAL STATUS WIDE JOINT METHODOLOGY TO ESTABLISH A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE EXISTING EMERGING AND ANTICIPATED THREATS IN CALIFORNIA. IT IDENTIFIES AND PRIORITIZES TOP CRIMINAL CYBER COUNTERINTELLIGENCE AND EXTREMISM. THREATS REGIONALLY AND STATEWIDE. THIS INTELLIGENT FRONT THIS INTELLIGENCE PRODUCTS SERVES AS A RESOURCE FOR GOVERNMENT EXECUTIVES GOVERNMENT AGENCIES FIRST RESPONDERS THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY TO MAINTAIN AWARENESS OF CURRENT AND EMERGING THREATS AND TRENDS TWO YEARS OF DEVELOPMENT OF STATEWIDE MITIGATION STRATEGIES WHICH ARE INCORPORATED INTO OUR CALIFORNIA HOMELAND SECURITY STRATEGY. IN CALIFORNIA. I'M STILL HITTING THE CALIFORNIA STATE WIDE THREAT ASSESSMENT THE TOP KEY THREAT ACTORS AND Q. THREAT ISSUES ARE IDENTIFIED BY THE STAFF USING A COMPLEX ANNUAL STATEWIDE ASSESSMENT PROCESS THIS PROCESS INCLUDING UNIFORM SCORING MATRIX USED BY EACH STASHED FUSION CENTER AGAINST A COMMON LIST OF THREAT ACTORS FROM SHARED MASTER THREAT LIST THE TOP KEY THREAT ISSUES ARE DERIVED FROM IDENTIFIED ISSUE AREAS AS PROVIDED BY THE RECIPIENTS OF THE UP THE SURVEY AND THROUGH OUR INTERACTION WITH THE CENTERS. WHEN A KEY THREAT ISSUED IDENTIFIED BY FOR MORE THE FUSION CENTERS THIS ADDED TO THE KEY THREAT ISSUES LESS THIS IS A PROCESS THAT ENSURES THAT WOULD NOT ONLY WE FOCUSED ON OUR TOP THREAT ISSUES BUT IDENTIFYING NEW AND EMERGING THREATS FACING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE. TWENTY TWENTY ONE- BASICALLY RECALL THAT WE DID AS A CAL STATE WHY THRUST OF MY REPORT- CALIFORNIA THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD IT IS THE MOST POPULOUS AND DIVERSE STATE IN THE COUNTRY. EIGHT OF THE UNITED STATES FIFTY MOST POPULOUS STATES RESIDE IN CALIFORNIA AS DOES THE WORLD'S BUSIEST LAND BORDER CROSSINGS ALISON DROVE THE WORLD'S PREMIER CENTER UP TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION AND SILICON VALLEY. THE BUSIEST CARGO PORT ON THE PACIFIC COAST OF NORTH AMERICA LONG BEACH ST UNITED STATES LARGEST. PRODUCING REGION THE CENTRAL VALLEY AS WELL AS SEVERAL CULTURAL DESTINATIONS THAT ATTRACT MILLIONS OF DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN INVESTORS INTO CALIFORNIA EVERY YEAR. WHILE THESE FEATURES HELP DESCRIBE CALIFORNIA SIZE AND SCALE THEY ALSO MAKE CALIFORNIA POTENTIAL ACTIVE TARGET TO FOREIGN ADVERSARIES TRANS NATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS. AND VIOLENT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXTREMOS MOTIVATED BY A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT IDEOLOGIES. FOR PERSONAL VARIABLES. SO FROM THE CRIMINAL CATEGORY FROM THIS REPORT A PERSISTENT SPENDING DURING THREAT FROM MEXICO BASED TRANS NATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS. STREET GANGS PRISON GANGS AND ORGANIZED CRIMINAL GROUPS REMAIN A TOP THREAT ISSUE FACING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THESE THREAT ACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO CALIFORNIA BEING THE ILLICIT DRUG GATEWAY FROM MEXICO INTO THE UNITED STATES THROUGH OUR LAND AND MARITIME ENVIRONMENTS. FROM OUR SERVER CATEGORY CALIFORNIA CITIZENS AND BUSINESSES ARE UNDER CONSTANT ATTACK AND THREATS FROM NATION STATE NATION STATE ACTORS CRIMINAL CYBER CRIMINALS AND MALICIOUS INSIDERS RECENT EXAMPLES OF A SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK BY OUR STATE SPONSORED ADVERSARIES HIGHLIGHT HOW IMPACTFUL. THESE COMPROMISES CAN BE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND TO THE OVERALL ECONOMY YEAH IN THE UNITED STATES AND CALIFORNIA. FROM THE EXTREMISM CATEGORY FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS PRESENT A PERSISTENT AND ENDURING THREAT CONTINUALLY TRYING TO DIRECT INSPIRE AND OR NAVAL ATTACKS AGAINST THE HOMELAND BEDTIMES EXPLICITLY CALLING OUT TARGETS IN CALIFORNIA. THE CALIFORNIA STATE FRONT OF CERTAIN CENTER OF THE STACK ALONG WITH OUR FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY PARTNERS HAVE NOTED A STARTER KIT CELEBRATION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE STREAM ISM. RADICALIZATION CALL FOR MOBILIZATION ATTACK PLOTTING AND ATTEMPTS IN RECENT YEARS CERTAINLY A PARADIGM SHIFT FROM THE H. B. THAT HERE TO A FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION IDEOLOGY. AS MUCH NO LONGER PRESENTS REPRESENTS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THREATS THE UNITED STATES. WHAT'S THAT REMAINS CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR LOOSELY ORGANIZED OR INDIVIDUAL DVDS MOBILIZING FOR VIOLENCE TO TARGET FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL ELECTED GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND POLITICAL PARTY REPRESENTATIVES. CONTINUE. DISCUSSIONS AND- PERPETUATION OF MISS AND DISINFORMATION NARRATIVES OF ELECTION FRAUD IN OPPOSITION TO ANTICIPATED ACTIONS OF NEWLY ELECTED EXECUTIVE AND LEGISLATIVE BRANCHES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAINLY. SOME INDIVIDUALS TO ADOPT THE BELIEVE THAT VIOLENT ACTION IS NECESSARY. THE JANUARY SIX U. S. CASUALTIES FOSTERED AN IN PERSON ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN DVDS OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY TWENTY TWO INDIVIDUALS TRAVELED FROM CALIFORNIA- TO THAT EVENT. WAS SUPPORTED VARYING IDEOLOGIES THE SHARING SIMILAR GOALS WHICH MAY LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN DVD CAPABILITIES COORDINATION AND MOTIVATION TO ATTACK AND UNDERMINE ELECTED OFFICIALS OR POLITICAL PARTY REPRESENTATIVES IF YOU AS- ILLEGITIMATE. I'M GOING FORCED EFFORTS TO ARREST INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE PRETENDING WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE U. S. CAPITOL SEATS LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCES COULD DETER SOME DVDS. AND LEAD OTHERS TO INCREASE THEIR OPERATIONAL SECURITY MEASURES TO REDUCE LAW ENFORCEMENT SCRUTINYBY THE USE OF ENCRYPTED APPS ON OUR PHONES- REALLY PARALYZING THE LONG CORPORATE COMMUNITY TO INTERCEPT THESE ATTACKS PLOTTED. SOME DVDS WILL VERY LIKELY CONTINUE TO TRANSITION TO A MORE SECURE ONLINE COMMUNICATION PLATFORM AS I JUST MENTIONED. FUTURE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE REMIX ACTIVITY IS VERY LIKELY TO BE INFLUENCED BY A VARIETY OF TOPICS TO INCLUDE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS LAW ENFORCEMENT USE OF FORCE DISCUSSIONS. THE CURRENT POLITICAL CLIMATE SUMMARIZED DISCUSSIONS IN CULVER NINETEEN POLICIES THESE ARE ALLDRIVERS- IN OUR CURRENT ENVIRONMENT FOR WHICH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THIS ASSESSMENT IS BASED UPON RECENT EVENTS IN CALIFORNIA AND THE UNITED STATES AND THE LIKELIHOOD THAT DISCUSSION REGARDING THESE TOPICS. WILL NOT BE RESOLVED IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE. ALSO ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THE SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY REPORTS THAT I KNOW MISTER SENATE THE NIGRICANS JOHNNY TALK ABOUT AS OUR FUSION SHOPS CENTER REPRESENTED FROM A STATEWIDE- VIEW ARTS THE STARS OR SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY REPORTS ARE OFFICIAL DOCUMENTED. OBSERVATION EIGHT YOU'RE REASONABLY INDICATIVE OF PRE OPERATIONAL PLANNING ASSOCIATE WITH TERRORISM OR OTHER CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. YEAR OVER YEAR CALIFORNIA GENERATES ON AVERAGE APPROXIMATELY FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED SARS- BY ALL OF THE REGIONAL FUSION CENTERS ARE MENTIONED BELOW ARE. AT STAKE APPROXIMATELY 40% OF THOSE STARS ARE REFERRED DIRECTLY TO THE JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCE FOR FURTHER LAW. ENFORCEMENT- ENGAGEMENT. SPECIFICALLY OR OF EAGAR- RECORDS AND THAT'S KIND OF THE STARS ARE GOING TO BE GUARDING ELECTRONIC SYSTEM FOR SHARING INDICATES THAT FROM THE FIRST OF JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TO THE THIRTY FIRST OF MARCH. A TOTAL OF NINETEEN HUNDRED CALIFORNIA BASED STARS WERE REPORTED. OF WHICH TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN OF THOSE WERE DIRECTLY- RELATED TO DEVIATE ACTIVITIES SO APPROXIMATELY 11% OF CURRENT STARS COMING THROUGH OUR VISITORS ARE RELATED TO THIS THREAT ISSUE. LASTLY ONE OF OUR CORE FUNCTIONS AT THE STACK IS TO CERTAINLY SHARE- IN INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION WITH OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS VIA ALERTS AND BULLETINS AND DIFFERENT INTELLIGENCE PRODUCTS. AS SUCH- DURING THAT SAME TIME PERIOD WE GENERATED OVER TWO HUNDRED TWENTY NINE ALERTS AND BULLETINS WERE SENT OUT TO. THESE ENTITIES I JUST MENTIONED AND THESE WERE ALL ROUGHLY. 20% OF OUR PRODUCTS DISSEMINATED ON THE DVD THREAT SOMEONE TO PREVENT PREVENT. PRESENT YOU KNOW KIND OF OUR CURRENT THREAT PICTURE- AND DIRECTOR OF TURN IT BACK OVER TO YOU. THANKS TALK. IT OUT OF IT'S IMPORTANT YOU KNOW OUR MISSION REALLY IS TO SECURE AND PREPARE CALIFORNIA IT'S PEOPLE A CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ON THE THREATS UPON JUST TALKED ABOUT AND OUR PREVIOUS PRESENTERS. I'VE NEVER BEEN MORE IMORTANT PARTICULARLY NOW WITH THE INCREASE IN HATE GROUPS AND DOMESTIC TERRORISM WHERE WE SEE MUCH DISCUSSION IMMOBILIZATION DURING CRICKET CHAT ROOMS SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS ON THE DARK WEB. IS AN ONGOING EFFORT THAT REQUIRES CONSTANTFOCUS AND ATTENTION BOTH ON THE GROUND AND ON THE WEB. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE OTHER REASONS WHY- WITH OUR OUR NEW CALIFORNIA CYBERSECURITY INTEGRATION CENTER- PLAY SUCH A CRITICAL ROLE WE CALL THE CAL SECTOR CAL SICK REALLY SERVES AS THAT CENTRAL ORGANIZING HUB. OF STATE GOVERNMENT CYBERSECURITY ACTIVITIES AND COORDINATES THE INFORMATION SHARING AT THE VARIOUS LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT- AND WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND UTILITIES AND OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS AND NON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS. THESE SERVICES INCLUDE PROGRAM ELEMENTS SUCH AS OVERARCHING CYBERSECURITY STRATEGIES INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS CONNECTING THE DOTS IF YOU WAIT BETWEEN- WHAT WE'RE SEEING ONLINE WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE DARK WEB. BEING ABLE TO USE THE TOOLS ARE TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT INFORMATION. IN SPANISH IT FOR INCIDENT RESPONSE. AGAIN MADE UP OF MULTIPLE AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS IT IS A COLLABORATIVE. INTEGRATED EFFORT AND- THAT THE STAFFS- AND THE CAL SICK ALL WORKING PROACTIVELY TOGETHER IN CONCERT THE BILL THE RESILIENCY AT THE AT THE VARIOUS LOCAL STATE AND THE REGIONAL LEVEL ARCHITECT TO ENSURE COMMUNITY SECURITY AND ECONOMIC SECURITY. AND PROTECTION OF THE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS CRITICAL ALL OF THESE THINGS PLAY INTO- THE DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE. TO EITHER RAMP UP OR RAMP DOWN SO POSTURE ALL OF THESE AT. THIS AND TELL THAT ARE GETTING FROM THE MULTIPLE SOURCES GIVE US- AN INDICATOR AS TO CREDIBILITY UP THREATS. OR MAKING HELPING US TO MAKE THE DECISION AS TO WHAT KIND OF RESOURCES WE NEED TO FOCUS OR FUN- TO GET THERE WE ALSO HAVE A VERY ROBUST- HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISORY COMMITTEE WHICH IS REALLY. MADE UP OF MULTIPLE LEADERS FROM ACROSS THE SPECTRUM IN IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FEDERAL STATE LOCAL PRIVATE SECTOR ORGANIZATIONS THE BODY ADVISES- MYSELF THE HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISER ON CURRENT SECURITY THREATS AND PRIORITIES. IN AN EFFORT TO PROVIDE AND PROMOTE A UNIFIED APPROACH SO THAT WERE COORDINATED ACROSS THE STATE EVEN THOUGH EACH REGION HAS ITS OWN REAL SIGNATURE WITH REGARDS TO THE KIND OF. OF THREATS THAT THE POPULATION BASED THAT THAT THE DEMOGRAPHICS WE DO TRY TO BUILD A STATEWIDE. EFFORT AND I STATEWIDE UNIFIED APPROACH IN OUR HOMELAND SECURITY STRATEGY. AS YOU'VE HEARD AND WILL CONTINUE TO HEAR TODAY THERE ARE MANY. STRATEGIES AND TACTICS USED TO COMBAT THE GROWING THREAT OF THE DOMESTIC TERRORISM. IT MAY BE HELPFUL THAT THAT I BRIEFLY JUST TOUCH UPON OUR HOMELAND SECURITY GRANTS AND HOW THEY'RE INVESTED TO BUILD RESILIENCY AND PREVENT AND RESPOND TO ACTS. OF TERRORISM- WE GET GRAY FROM THE S. THE OF HOMELAND SECURITY- PER THAT GUIDELINES EACH STATE RECEIVES ALL FUNDING MUST DESIGNATE UP TO TEN INVESTMENT JUSTIFICATIONS FOR THAT FUNDS THAT FOCUS ON FUNDING PRIORITIES FOR EACH YEAR EACH INVESTMENT JUSTIFICATION MUST DEMONSTRATE HOW. PROPOSED INVESTMENTS SUPPORT TERRORISM PREPAREDNESS. CLOSE CAPABILITY GAPS OR SUSTAIN EXISTING CAPABILITIES AND ALSO SUPPORT ADDRESSING ANY LOGISTICAL TECHNOLOGICAL LEGAL POLICY OR OTHER IMPEDIMENTS TO FOSTER A CULTURE OF STATE AND NATIONAL PARENTS. THIS FUNDING SUSTAINS A CONTINUAL EFFORT TO PREVENT PREPARE FOR PROTECT AGAINST RESPOND TO ACTS OF TERRORISM THROUGHOUT THE STATE. EACH YEAR CALIFORNIA DEVELOPS UP TO TEN SUCH INVESTMENT JUSTIFICATIONS BASED UPON IMPORT FROM THE HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER. BOTH THE INVESTMENT JUSTIFICATION AND THE BUDGET COMMITTEE ARE MULTI JURISDICTIONAL FORMS ARE INCLUDE MANY MANY DIFFERENT AGENCIES. IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ONE THE INVESTMENT JUSTIFICATION LAST ARE- FOR CALIFORNIA INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING. TO ENHANCE INFORMATION INTELLIGENCE SHARING AND COOPERATION WITH FEDERAL AGENCIES. INCLUDING DEPARTMENT HOMELAND SECURITY FBI ENHANCE IN THE PROTECTION OF SOFT TARGETS. PRODDED PLACES ARE ENHANCE CYBERSECURITY ADDRESS A MERGING THREATS. COMBAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE EXTREMISM THROUGH ENHANCED INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION ANALYSIS TRAINING AND COMMUNITY RESILIENCE. STRENGTHENING COMMUNITY COMMUNICATIONS CAPABILITIES WE'RE PLANNING GOVERNANCE TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENT ENHANCE MEDICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH PREPAREDNESS STRICT INTERPRETATION SHARING COLLABORATION ENHANCE COMMUNITY CAPABILITIES TO MULTI JURISDICTIONAL IN A JURISDICTIONAL ALL HAZARD PLANNING. AND PROTECT CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN KEY RESOURCES AS YOU CAN SEE THESE TEN INVESTMENT EXPECTATIONS ARE BROUGHT AND IT GIVES. US AN ABILITY TO PROVIDE THE FRAME BY WE BUILD A AND ME THE CIGNA. OF UNIQUE IS OF OUR VARIOUS REGIONS WHILE STILL BOUGHT A BUILDING IN AN OVERARCHING STRATEGY FOR THE STATE AND THAT STRATEGY ALSO TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE THREAT ASSESSMENT PROCESS THAT TOM HAD MENTIONED. EARLIER SO BOB. ALL OF THIS IS WRAPPED IT TOGETHER THEN INTO- AN ANNUAL STATE ONLY INSECURITY STRATEGY THE STRATEGY IS CALIFORNIA'S ROAD MAP TOWARDS ENHANCING OUR CAPABILITIES AND REDUCING AND MITIGATING THE REST IT ENSURES THAT WE ARE MEASURING THREE THROUGH OBJECTIVES THE EFFORTS THAT WE'RE PUTTING FORTH SO CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE BOARD IN ALL THE VARIOUS SECTORS WITH ALL OF THE VARIOUS THREATS ARE BEING ADDRESSED IT IN EVEN IN AND- AND UNIFIED MANNER AND THAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS. ITS OVER ARCHING- STRATEGY IS REALLY THE SEP FOURTH OF OUR STATE'S HOMELAND SECURITY'S PRIORITIES FROM THE STATE LEVEL ALL THE WAY DOWN TO OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES ESTABLISHED PERFORMANCE METRICS TO MEASURE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STRATEGY AND ALIGN AND INTEGRATE THESE PRAYER OR AT PRIORITIES WHICH STATEWIDE FUNDING AS IT BECOMES AVAILABLE AND FUNDING COMES FROM AGAIN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT ALSO UP THROUGH SOME STATE LEVEL- FUNDING. AS A PART OF THE UPDATE THE STATE'S HOMEMADE SECURITY STRATEGY FOR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE DOMESTIC BONTA EXTREMISM HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF THE TOP HOMELAND SECURITY THREATS FACING THE STATE THE STRATEGY HAS IDENTIFIED SEVERAL OBJECTIVES WITH THE NEXUS TO COMBATING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE EXTREMISM MOVING FORWARD TO INCLUDE ENHANCING THE STATE'S. TERRACE AND LYFT OFFICER PROGRAM. I THINK THE STATE'S THREAT ASSESSMENTS PLAY PROCESS. IMPROVING AMONGST THE STATUS INTELLIGENCE ANALYSTS ACQUIRING NEW RISK ASSESSMENT AND THREAT MODELING AND ANALYSIS TOOLS. CONDUCTING STATEWIDE DROUGHT ASSESSMENTS IDENTIFY CURRENT AND EMERGENCY EMERGING THREATS IN THIS SPACE FACING THE STATE. DEVELOPING TO RESOURCES FOR FIRST RESPONDERS AND OWNERS AND OPERATORS OF SOFT TARGETS AND CROWDED PLACES ARE BEST PRACTICE IN MITIGATING THESE TERRORIST THREATS. CONDUCTING RESEARCH ON STATE OF DISINFORMATION AND MISINFORMATION ON HATE PREVENTION PROGRAMS IN A DIGITAL AND SOCIAL MEDIA LANDSCAPE. ARE PRODUCING POLICY PROPOSALS ON LOCAL OP VIOLENCE PREVENTION EFFORTS TO BE MADE TO BE AVAILABLE TO STATEWIDE STAKEHOLDERS AND LASTLY ENHANCING STATEWIDE TRAINING RESOURCES IN THE AREA OF DIGITAL MEDIA LITERACY. RATE REDUCTION TARGET VIOLENCE PREVENTION AND COUNTERTERRORISM. AS IT'S BEEN DESCRIBED. THE THREAT OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM. AND EXTREMIST ACTIVITY IS MULTI DIMENSIONAL REQUIRES A COMPLEX NETWORK OF HOMELAND SECURITY INITIATIVES TO COMBAT IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE CONTINUE TO ENSURE A ROBUST WHOLE OF COMMUNITY APPROACH. TO SUSTAINING AND BUILDING CAPABILITIES ACROSS THE HOMELAND SECURITY ENTERPRISE. SUCH AN APPROACH NECESSITATE ENGAGEMENT FROM INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES. COMMUNITIES PRIVATE NONPROFIT SECTOR FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS. AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. COULD SHE THIS. WE WILL CONTINUE A MULTI DISCIPLINARY MULTI JURISDICTIONAL CAPABILITY IN PLANNING ORGANIZING EQUIPPING TRAINING AND EXERCISING ACROSS ALL. SECTORS IN THE PREVENTION PROTECTION MITIGATION RESPONSE RECOVERY OF THE MISSIONARIES THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AT PGA- PROJECT THE TOPIC AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

ALTHOUGH WHAT I'M ALSO GOING TO DISCUSS ABOUT THE JERRY YOU CAN FUTHER THAT MOST WANT TO TALK ABOUT ARE THE CORE COMPETENCIES OF MOST OF THE FUSION CENTER HERE IN CALIFORNIA- I READ THE VICE CHAIR SPEAK- ABOUT WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS A LONG TIME. HERE THE FACT WE WRITE. SOME GOOD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HISTORY MARIE HOW WE GOT TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY. AND THEN WE'LL TALK ABOUT SOME SPECIFIC PROCESSES THAT HAVE BEEN. SORT OF SOCIALIZED THROUGHOUT THAT FUSION CENTER NETWORK. THE JERRY GETS UP AND FOUNDED IN TWO THOUSAND SIX IT WAS AN OUTGROWTH OF THE LOS ANGELES. DODGERS MEMORY WARNING GROUP- THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT- AND WHEN IT WAS OPRATIONAL TELEFONICA JERRY PART WAS PULLED AND THE DELIVERY SYSTEM X. P. A CONSERVATIVE SEVENTEEN SEPARATE. GROUPS AROUND THE COUNTRY FROM COOPERATING CITIES AND COUNTIES- SEVENTY THOUSAND SIX SUPPORTED BY THE US DEPARTMENT HOMELAND SECURITY GW'S ROCKY BOLTED INTO WHAT IS NOW THE NATIONAL FUSION CENTER NETWORK. I NEVER PERSONALLY I LIKE MY CHANNEL TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT THAT BUT THERE IS HAT CURRENTLY BUT ET. SEPARATE FUSION CENTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. ALL FEDERALLY FOR BUT LET GOT AND SO WITH- THE JERK SPECIFICALLY WHAT'S GREAT AS AN INTELLIGENCE COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE F. B. I. LAPD AND THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT HERE IN LA. OTHER PARTNERS ARE FROM LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY FIRE SERVICE HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS- ALSO JOINED AT THAT TIME- JERRY NOW SPONSORED ABOUT TWENTY TWO DIFFERENT AGENCIES FEDERAL. STATE LOCAL I. HERE TO JERICHO. SOME OF THE PART TIME AND SUMMER FULL TIME. A LOT OF THE L. A. T. W.

OR THERE IS THE GENERIC LIKE MOST FUSION CENTERS IN BOSTON ALL THREATS CENTER ADDRESSING TRADITIONAL AND EMERGING THREATS WITHIN IT AND I EACH. GAIL ARE FROM THE BEGINNING THE JERICA BENNETT A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT THE FIRE SERVICE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY MEDICAL. SERVICES AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR THROUGH THE END FOR GUARD PROGRAM RUN BY THE FBI FBI BUT LOCATED IN THE CENTER HERE.

WHETHER THEY INVOLVE TRADITIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION OR THREATS TO PUBLIC HEALTH. ONLY RECENTLY SELECTED AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR HERE I HAVE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE ADDRESSING EXTREMIST VIOLENCE GANDER IN MY PRIOR POSITION. AS THE INTELLIGENCE COMMANDER AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT COMMANDING OFFICER FOR THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. THE FIRST BIG BROTHER JERICA COMMISSION I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT SOME LOCAL REGIONAL NATIONAL INITIATIVE THAT HISTORICALLY ADDRESSED ISSUES OF EXTREMISM AT AND HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. ON THE VISION CENTER CONCEPT. MY PRIOR CAREER TO SHERIFF DEPARTMENT I WAS FORTUNATE TO BE SELECTED TO REPRESENT MY AGENCY ON BOTH A MAJOR CITIES CHIEFS AND MAJOR COUNTY SHERIFF'S INTEL COMMANDER OF GROUPS. BOTH IT ORGANIZATIONS WORK POWER FIRELESS LATE. REGARDING- DEVELOP A PROTOCOL BASICALLY FOR SHARING SPECIAL SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY REPORTING REGARDING DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXTREMIST BEHAVIOR AND PROVIDING LOCAL AND REGIONAL INPUT CAN APPLE DIRECTORS OF INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION FOR THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION DEPARTMENT HOMELAND SECURITY AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. RECALLS IMPORTANT INDEED ASSOCIATION FOR INSTRUMENTAL IN THE PHILOSOPHICALLY SUPPORTING THE ESTABLISHMENT GROWTH AND FUNDING FOR NATIONAL PEOPLE CENTER NETWORK.

THE INTELLIGENCE COMMANDER TO SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT I WAS A PART OF THE JERRICK. ELEMENT OF A STATEWIDE SYSTEM IT WAS CLEAR THAT SUCH A SYSTEM. JACK EXISTING CALIFORNIA BUILD MULTIPLE COUNTSIN THE COLLECTION AND DISSEMINATION OF INTELLIGENCE ISSUES. SO DO YOU BELIEVE THAT OR TO TALK ABOUT TODAY SO THE JERICHO ARE THE THIRD MANY INSTANCES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE EXTREMISM. THE BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT VITAL EXTREMISM AND BEEN HERE FOR A LONG TIME AND REMAINS A PERENNIAL CONCERN. THAT'S LOCAL AGENCIES HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN THE COUNTER TERRORISM COUNTER EXTREMISM MISSION FOR A LONG TIME INDIVIDUALLY AS WELL AS COLLABORATIVE LEE AT CENTER LIKE THE GENERAL. TERRORISM AND EXTREMISM ARE NOT THE MOST FREQUENT CHALLENGES FACED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND THE PUBLIC SAFETY PARTNERS BUT THEY WILL REMAIN A PERSISTENT CONCERN IN THE FUTURE. ONE FREQUENT OUTSIDE IMPACT ON POLITICS FINDING RESOURCES OPERATIONS AND OVERSIGHT. WHEN WE LOOK AT SPECIFIC INCIDENTS THAT OCCUR IN THE AREA ARE WE REALLY LOOK AT HOW THEY CAN BE SHARED AMONG HER PARTNERS AND WHAT WE MIGHT DO IN REACTION TO THOSE SO- MOST OF PEOPLE CENTERS ARE NOT OPERATIONAL WE DON'T HAVE INVESTIGATIVE ARMS. BUT WE CAN LEARN FROM WHAT OCCURS AND PROVIDE TRAINING OR SUPPORT TO OUR LOCAL PARTNERS. BUT INSTEAD- INCIDENT IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE PROBABLY EVERYBODY HEARD ABOUT IT IT WAS A- RADICAL GROUP THAT IT EMANATED OUT OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. J. I. S. WHICH MEANS. ASSOCIATION APPROVES FONG I WON'T ATTEND THE ARABIC TRANSLATION OF THAT BECAUSE I WOULD JUST DESTROY IT BUT- IT WAS- A SMALL GROUP OF PRISONERS BASICALLY INSIDE THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS IF THEY STARTED A CELL BASED ON A CORRECTED VERSION OF ISLAM.

THAT IS BECAUSE THEY WERE PROCESSES PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT THE CORE COMPETENCIES MENTIONED ARE REPLICATED THROUGHOUT THE CALIFORNIA FUSION CENTER SYSTEM. ALBEIT WITH LOCAL FLAVOR. JERICHO'S WELL DEFINED PROTOCOLS FOR ADDRESSING DVD IS USED WE ARE NOT STICK TO THE POLITICS GOAL OF OUR MAKE UP AND ANY GROUP. I THINK JENNIFER ISLANDS. S. PERPETRATED BY WORD OR DEED TO CHARITIES AND IS INTERESTING. BECAUSE I HAVE SUCH A JERK OF A WIDER RESPONSIBILITY IT IS CHALLENGING TO MAINTAIN AWARENESS OF ALL THE THREATS CONTAINED WITHIN THEIR WORK. HOWEVER THE WHITE MAN ONCE SAID IT TAKES A NETWORK TO DEFEAT A NETWORK. UNDER THE TERRORISM. OFFICER PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM WILL EVOLVE SINCE NINE ELEVEN AND SHOULD BE RENAMED.

DIRECTLY TOWARDS. AND BACK WE'VE BEEN ON ONE FOR THE LAST HOUR THAT WE RECEIVED ACTUALLY FROM THE NATIONAL PARK OPERATIONS CENTER OUR FBI PARTNERS ARE ALSO PART OF THIS PROJECT. BUT IT TAKES A WHOLE COMMUNITY THANKS PUBLIC REPORTING IT TAKES THAT INFORMATION GETTING THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. HAPPY WITH THE PERMISSION TO US AND THE STAFF ACROSS ALL OF OUR FUSION CENTERS. THAT WAY WE CAN PROCESS THAT LOOK AT THE CONNECTIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND THROUGH OUR PARTNERS IN THE BILL CAN BE TENS OF ACROSS THE WORLD. BUT IF THIS CAPACITY THAT WE HAVE BUILT. ON A LOT NOT BEEN WORKING ON ALLTHESE YEARS IN THE PARTNERSHIP THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE BUILT. TO IDENTIFY THOSE THREATS WHILE PROTECTING PRIVACY THE RIGHTS OF LIBERTY. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GOING AFTER PEOPLE FOR CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR THAT WE'RE GOING AFTER PEOPLE FOR THE SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOR THAT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AS PRE INCIDENT INDICATORS ATTACK. ANY TO STORIES BUT ONE WHERE THE INDIVIDUAL STOP THE NAPA- THAT'S THE TACK THAT POTENTIALLY COULD HAVE GONE HORRIBLY WRONG. THE STOCK BECAUSE THE PUBLIC REPORT AND BECAUSE OF THE GOOD WORK OF THE FBI DID YEAH THE COORDINATION WITH ALL OF OUR PARTNERS. AND OUR ROLE IS ALSO- RESPONDING TO THESE EVENTS. RECORDING EVENTS AND- REALLY FACILITATE INFORMATION SHARING WITH OUR PARTNERS IN THE FBI BOTH FOR OUR REGION- THROUGH OUR STATE AND ACROSS THE NATION. THANK EVERYONE FOR THE TIME TODAY I KNOW THAT OUR TIME IS UP. AND I APPRECIATE THAT- ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. I THANK YOU FOR MY- REALLY TO ALL. THE FOLKS FOR PER. IN OUR TEST. HERE THE SECOND PANEL. OF THE C. AS WE- PRETTY MUCH A THE END OF. OUR TO OUR BUT WE STILL HAVE A FEW LEFT. SOME COURSE SUCH HAD TWO QUICK QUESTIONS I JUST WANTED. TO BRING ABOUT IN HERE FROM WHEREVER. COULD GIVE ME SOME ANSWERS ONE OF IS. BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC AND WHAT IS DONE TO US AS A STATE IN HOW WE OPERATE- AND COMING OUT OF IT THIS YEAR WERE THE MAJOR OBSTACLES. DEALING WITH THE PANDEMIC ON TOP OF WHAT YOU GUYS DO ALREADY. MONITORING THREATS AND RESPONDING TO MAKING SURE THAT- WE HAVE THE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO COMBAT THE ISSUES. FOR WONDER FOR TO- OTHER THAN FUNDING AS WELL AS THE FUNDING TO IMPROVE ORGANIZATIONS. ANYTHING THAT HERE THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO TO HELP YOU FOLKS IN THE JOBS YOU DO TO PROTECT US IN CALIFORNIA. A REFER ANYBODY IF ANYBODY COULD GIVE ME A QUICK- DR ON THAT OR ANYTHING. I CAN DOT I DON'T THINK THE TRAINING TO IF THAT'S IF THAT'S OF INTEREST SO THE TRAINING OBVIOUSLY TOOK A TOOK A BIG HIT OVER THE LAST YEAR. I THINK AND JEREMIAH CANNELLA FUSIONS ARE DOING A LOT OF TRAINING BUT VERY SOCIALLY DISPENSED MEETING ALL CDC GUIDELINES. HONORS AT ONE TIME EDWARD FIFTEEN OR TWENTY WOULD BE TRYING TO KEEP IT GOING BUT- MATT RELATED OF I DON'T DROVE DOWN THE NUMBER OF THE PROJECT- ACT REPORTS WORRIES ONE OR- FORTY HUNDRED TO TWO. SIX- SORRY AGENCY HERE YOU EVER- AND LET YEAR WAS NINE SOMETHING SO THE PER ONE NOW GAS WERE. I THINK WERE. SO THAT PART BECAUSE I COUPLE BIT- AND I IT IS BECAUSE THE NUMBERS ARE STARTING TO COME SALAS UP A TRY SIDE OF MY COMPETITION COME ON THE. S. AND MY WOULD BE. THE THAT. WITH OSAMA COMPANIES- YOU KNOW THEY IS NO REQUIRE THAT THREE. ANY THREATS TO LAW COURSE UNLESS IT INVOLVES. A THE EXPERT TRADE EXPORTS OF AFFECT WHAT. OF A CHILD. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT YOU KNOW SOME THE LARGE COMPANIES. IN THE FOR SOCIAL MEDIA. ATTEMPTING TO CAL. AND BELIEVE ME WE COME ALL WAY TO TWENTY EIGHT PARTNER OF THE CAR. ON EVERY FOR TRY ACCORDING COLLAPSE. BUT WE WILL AT THE WORLD AND YOU. THE EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE SOCIAL. SO THAT THAT ARE ON. HAVE NOT SLOWED DOWN BAD THAT MAKES WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THE- EVERY DAY. BUT NO ONE HAS GONE TO EXAM. YOU KNOW HOW DO WE- WANNA FACT AND CALL. THE REPORTING THAT WE SHOULD GET FROM SOCIAL COMPANY. AND THE IN BECAUSE THERE ARE NO STATUTE IT AND I KNOW THAT MAY BE A- A NATIONAL- ISSUE BUT THE GREAT THING THAT CONVERSATION STATE WHILE. HOW DO WE- THE- COURT. ON THE TYPES OF AND LINKS. DAN HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. FOR US TO KEEP A LID. ON ON WHAT WE'RE DOING BECAUSE I THINK- POSTING TO GET COMPLACENT THE FARTHER AWAY YOU GET FROM FROM A MAJOR INCIDENT LIKE NINE ELEVEN. I J. THE MORE COMPLACENT PEOPLE COME N. AND WHEN YOU'RE DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB THEY DON'T KNOW THAT YOU'RE DOING THAT GOOD JOB. AND AND THEN THERE'S A TENDENCY FOR PEOPLE TO SAY. YOU KNOW WE DON'T NEED TO BE DOING THAT ANYMORE AND- AND WHEN I THINK- THE TESTIMONY TODAY POINTS TO THE FACT THAT. THIS IS JUST ONE LAYER OF. LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT HAS TO CONTINUE TO- TO EXIST AT THE LEVELS AND EVEN MORE SO- IN ORDER TO KEEP. OUR PEOPLE SAFE AND THAT'S WHAT THESE COMMITTEES ARE ABOUT THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE. ARE WE WANT TO PUBLIC TO BE SAFE PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO WALK THE STREET THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE A FENCE AROUND THE CAPITAL.
