hearing on mass timber and other innovative forest products- many of you who are here know that we've been having huge problems in our first wildfire and ladder fuels in the over abundance of them is a contributing factor to those fires and the problem is that there's not much use right now for those fuels and so nobody wants to go into the forest and clear them out and when they do a lot of times they just bring them on site which is very bad for the environment- and- bad for the who live in the area. And we're here today to explore whether there are other uses for that would- that would be better for the environment better for us and also to see what the impact on housing and economic development in California would be if we- did find a- better way to utilized as material. I want to welcome you all here today and I want to invite our- panel to come up and join us. That I will let you all introduce yourselves but just keep your introductions very short- and then you can make your presentations in the order we have it's up to you all but I have Jennifer- Montgomery Britney Kovic- from hell gang and energy lots of a and if you want to go in that order. That's fine. Okay. Ms Montgomery welcome thank you very much thank you chairman chairwoman Friedman I am Jennifer Montgomery and son thank you for the opportunity to speak today I'm the director of the governor's forest management task force and I'm here to provide a look at some of the challenges and opportunities for a California based wood products industry. Leveraging the task force California and our federal partners aim to increase the pace and scale of science based forest management two one million acres per year five hundred thousand acres for the state and five hundred thousand acres for the federal government. This increased pace and scale will result in increased amounts of merchant apple timber end of low value woody biomass creating opportunities for entrepreneurs. All fire who you her from later leads our efforts to prevent and fight wild fire increasingly tackles the task of vegetation management. California has allocated a billion dollars two hundred million per year over five years to scale up our forest management. To meet our goal this includes enforcing vegetation and defensible space requirements around homes and communities and working with Caltrans and counties to improve vegetation management along roadways and other evacuation routes with the help of the California National Guard the California conservation corps and many others hellfire tripled fuel treatments from thirty thousand acres last year to ninety thousand acres this year. And implemented thirty five emergency fuel reduction projects that will help protect two hundred of our most vulnerable communities for context the federal government owns 57% of California's thirty three million acres of forest land 40% are privately owned and only 3% is state owned given this ownership managing our forests and creating a reliable sustainable and consistent stream of material for wood products manufacturing. Relies on active and effective partnerships with private landowners and federal tribal and local governments centuries of fire exclusion has left overly dense forests what development into the wildland urban interface puts more residents at risk wild fires that had been relatively low and moderate intensity which cleared out underbrush and left healthy forests now our intensity stand replacing fires that pollute our air. Destroys soil watersheds habitat for plants and animals and threaten lives and property. When governor Newsome took office he strengthened California's response to the growing wild fire threat cal fire has almost completed the thirty five emergency projects including removal of hazard trees understorey clearing reintroduction of managed fire. Creation of fuel breaks and community defensible spaces and creation of safer evacuation corridors all with an eye toward preventing ecological devastation and loss of life. Governor new some continues to utilize the task force to organize actions across state agencies along with other governmental and non governmental partners. This means we are not alone in addressing this issue. In twenty eighteen the US Forest Service invested over two hundred million dollars nationally in fuels reduction resulting in treatment of almost three hundred ten thousand acres in California. But due to fire borrowing their twenty nineteen resources for fuels reductions dropped by nearly half. Beginning next year the practice of fire barring will be ended but the proposed federal budget also cuts the Forest Service hazardous fuels reduction account by over forty million dollars. Given these realities they have lowered their fuels reduction targets hearing California by almost a third. The US Forest Service will need significant budget expansion to increase treatments to the five hundred thousand acres a year. Healthcare is developing a programmatic E. I. R. that will address years of fire suppression. By completing landscape level environmental review of vegetation management activities it helps streamlined projects while maintaining strict environmental standards. Friedman activities will be designed to appropriately reduce fire fuels site strategic fuel breaks and mimic a natural fire regime using prescribed burning. To achieve our target of five hundred thousand acres a year to build forest health and protect communities we will need to enhance forest's activities from workforce development to constructing production facilities and expanding markets for the would be materials coming out of our forest. Current forest's treatments have created thousands of slash piles in California's forests an estimated five million tons of biomass. Well some of this can be safely burned on site finding lower carbon solutions such as producing cross laminated timber. Additional traditional lumber products and bioenergy including electricity and bio fuels is our priority. Some demand already exists for these products however most of the engineered wood products using California are imported from other states and countries. The joint institute for wood products innovation was established to identify carbon sequestering products and technologies that can be expanded in California. And to recommend areas for state investment to support wood utilization. Working with go biz and others we are actively reaching out to and recruiting private investment into a California based wood products market. Building a locally sourced and produced wood products industry would generate jobs in California. Create domestic markets for materials produced from our forests treatments into mitigate climate change using our construction materials and for its treatment activities. The wood utilization working group of the forest management task force has focused on ways to improve the flow of slash from for it to buy amounts facility. Which often struggle to find reliable supplies from forestry that projects. Debbie Franco it OPR has been successful in identifying so called waste biomass that would otherwise have been pile burned or left to rot on the forest floor releasing methane and other GHGs. The task force is wood utilization working group has partnered with would works in with the governor's office on a mass timber building competition we've worked with the office of the state fire marshal to focus on modernizing standards for tall mast timber buildings. Working with the department of general services we intend to identify three future state buildings to be constructed utilizing mass timber. We are striving to expand the would production work force including Forest equipment operators truckers mill workers in small and large investors. We will do this by supporting training and recruitment programs that expand opportunities for forestry and wood production activities in facilities in our state. This will send a strong signal to private enterprise that we are serious about creating opportunities for business to thrive in California. We're confident the efforts of these public private partnerships that expanse on its base forest management will translate into greater production of woody biomass products resulting in safer communities. Reduced wild fire risk healthier forest's greater climate resilience in sustainable economic development for our world communities. The speakers following me today will help identify more of the opportunities and challenges facing us at the state relating to woody biomass utilization. I thank you for your time and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. Thank you I'm gonna I'm ask questions at the end of the panel thank you. If you don't mind just introduce yourself and when a two lines. Good afternoon share Friedman my name is Britney cover chimes the. Policy not reach branch manager with this year in about a Conservancy- stand about a Conservancy the state Conservancy under California natural resources agency and I think you for the opportunity to speak here today. You're not a Conservancy is really committed to improving the health and resilience of Sierra Nevada forests and- part of that effort is to support the development of infrastructure that can sustainably utilize material produce from forest management product projects- we feel that it's vital to create and expand markets for wood products. That utilize the forest species and sizes harvested as a by project by product of ecological restoration. The state does not have the financial resources to accomplish the goals stated in the forest carbon plan alone and so we feel that we must harness the power of markets. To support ecological restoration as a complement to state and federal funds. Development of additional Forest bioenergy power generation in the Sierra Nevada coupled with innovative wood products campuses would provide a market for excess biomass to help increase the pace and scale of forest restoration activities will also creating jobs and opportunities for community economic development. As Jennifer courageous said the effect of increasing the pace and scale of forest restoration will be greater volumes of March and double and non merchant of all material. And currently a major major portion of that by masses piled earned in the forest. But it represents a huge untapped resource for the generation of heat power bio fuels and new wood products all all reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Recent innovations and vile mass energy technology innovative building materials and other areas provide an opportunity for the environmentally sustainable use of access forest biomass. To create valuable products in California well increasing the resilience of the state's forests and protecting the region's communities from large damaging wildfires. This year about a Conservancy recognises the unique challenges that face rural resource dependent communities in the Sierra Nevada. We've seen the devastation that a catastrophic wild fire can inflict on the citizens communities and natural resources of the region. Economically many Sierra communities are experiencing a shrinking tax base a scarcity of skilled workers and changing demographics and while recreation and tourism and working landscapes remain important elements of local economies. Many communities are struggling with economic diversification and job creation sort of brings your this year about our region to a holistic health the communities within the region need support that empowers their efforts to address urgent needs plan for the future. Develop organizational capacity and resiliency and envision new tools and partnerships and this will include a focus on biomass utilization infrastructure and workforce development in support of community resilience. In twenty fifteen this year about a Conservancy launch this year in about a watershed improvement program which is- large landscape scale holistic restoration program. And it's being implemented across our region through a strong network of state federal local non governmental and tribal partners and through the watershed improvement program this year in about a Conservancy is actively involved in supporting. The establishment of community skill biomass utilization infrastructure and many other partners that we're working with our here speaking today. I'd like to provide just a few examples of the kinds of efforts that this year in about a Conservancy is sporting through our grant funding capacity building. And grant writing and technical assistance work that we're doing. In twenty eight teams here in about a Conservancy received a unique one million dollar appropriation from the timber regulation and forest restoration fund. I'm not appropriation was given to us and see to support the development of innovative wood and biomass utilization infrastructure. Using this funding the SMC supported the Sierra institutes capacity building program to help communities with abandon mil sites move through the process is needed to redevelop the land for new wood processing businesses. This program will include assistance with environmental cleanup infrastructure zoning and permits and organizational development and training. We also serve as the project manager for the national disaster resilience competition which is a seventy million dollar grant that the state received to implement an integrated forest and community resilience program designed to address unmet recovery needs from the rim fire. And prepare the communities for future disasters. One of the pillars of this project is focused on developing a biomass utilization facility into all me county to help dispose of biomass generated through forest thinning efforts in the county. And we're partnering with the rural community assistance corporation are see AC. To implement this pillar our C. AC will create a revolving loan funds designed to offer loans to enterprises looking to start or expand biomass utilization operations and to all my county. And as an alternative to pile burning wood waste while creating economic development opportunities in the county. The fund will have an initial capitalization of about eighteen million dollars and after initial loans are made to projects and follow me county loan payments will be deposited back into our CA sees fund for future lending to support biomass and wood processing enterprises. In forested areas of California with a priority in this year and about a region. You're not a Conservancy is also involved in supporting innovative forest product development by connecting our partners partners in the region with discussions at the state level around market development. And lastly the essence he supports for us product workforce development as well- force management and wood processing industries suffer from a bottle neck of inadequate work force the problem ranges from forest restoration planners to equipment operators to Forest crews. And so with the twenty eighteen timber regulation enforced restoration funds we received we also use that to support several pilot workforce development efforts these included a workforce development needs assessments. Which this year business council might speak about later- SPC was funded to conduct a work force needs assessment for the forest products industry working with state community college center for excellence SBC's outlining the work force needs. Available programs and potentials for additional program developments and phase two of the effort will be identification of sites resources and curriculum for program development and implementation. In addition- we supported the Sierra Nevada alliance which is funded to develop a pilot Sierra corps program which is a professional development fellowship program. To provide additional staff support to forest and watershed health product projects in the region let's program creates an opportunity for career training to increase the number of qualified forest management professionals. And last the essence he provided funding to the Calaveras healthy products impacts solutions which also known as chips. Chips is a nonprofit organization which recruits trains certifies and deploys native American and at risk youth to perform feels reduction prescribed fire and other restoration tasks. SNC provided funding to replicate their tribal forest probe restoration of prescribed fire work crew training and certification program at other sites with the hope of spreading it throughout the Sierra Nevada. I those are just a few examples of some of the efforts that were helping to support in the region and happy to answer questions at the end. Thank you so much next. Good afternoon share Friedman. My name is- hell gang and I'm the deputy director of resource management that California. I'm joined today by and your lotus our assistant deputy director for climate and energy. And thank you for inviting us to this really very important conversation. We have already heard there is a urgent need to thin excessively down forests in many areas of the state to increase wildfires billion some forest held. And traditionally. There has been a lack of demand for the often small diameter trees. Coming out of the standing operations which usually have comparatively little commercial value. In order to facilitate a higher demand for these trees. Our state needs to develop production facilities for what we call mass timber which is really smaller dimension pieces so lumber there are glued together or otherwise press together into larger dimensional lumber. Lower background during the past few years California has experienced some the most destructive fires in the record history. In twenty seventeen over ten thousand homes were destroyed. Structures and in twenty eighteen over twenty two thousand structures. The last few far season we have seen over two million acres burned across the state. And over a hundred people. Residents and first responders have tragically lost their lives in wild fires. The effects of climate change and years of fire suppression activities overgrown forests and the prolonged drought have resulted in an unprecedented tree mortality in the state forest. As well as an increase in the number of sites and severity of wildfires. Loss of life and structures as a director proximate result of wildfires is an all time high now. One of the reasons that California's sorry California's forests are vulnerable to catastrophic disasters. It's S. stated already they are significantly overgrown. There's not enough water and sunlight the available to support all the trees on the given area. As results men the trees become stressed on Wall noble to fire on the seas. Fires drought pest outbreaks and subsequent landslides are more likely to be so damaging. That they may not be able to recover and provide the ecological functions when National Forest after a such an event. And we end up with what the cold type conversion which is. Really a conversion from a forest to and other ecosystem. Typically brush species which are much less capable of storing the amounts of carbon. That a forest can. California aims to help return are forced to help the state by treating five hundred thousand acres on private lands every year. When you combine that with our federal colleagues commitment of the same acreage. Five on Tel snakes on federal lands. We are looking at a total of one million acres per year we feel that can make a significant. Meaningful ecological ecological a meaningful difference in this problem. I should mention that tree removal is really only one of the tools that California system and force helps. Other methods include reforestation- meadow restoration habitat restoration road maintenance prescribed fire mechanical Dinning stream right restoration. And the list goes on. These are all necessary parts of the forest helps tool kit that we use depending on the management situation in that particular area. In this particular hearing since the focus is a specifically on the innovative wood products. We are going to primarily discussed the utilisation of word coming out of the forest during thinning operations. And. California's fourth currently hold about two billion metric tons of carbon. And in order to stabilize that carbon once it's removed from. Thinning operations. It's essential that we keep it sequestered in wood products rather than leave it in the forest to become polls and release greenhouse gases or related to the atmosphere with other pollutants through pile or broadcast burning. Some not gonna turn it over to Angie who will describe some of what cal fired us to support the beneficial uses the fourth products removed during sending. Thank you. Madam chair as mentioned my name is Angela autism assistant deputy director cal fire- the demand for mass timber in California already exists. Cal fire has dedicated staff that work with landowners businesses and public sector and entities to promote mass timber as an economically viable option for the- disposition of California's forest products. However right now the state of Oregon is the major producer of mass timber on the west coast. In fact the majority of organs mass temper products are sold into the California market. California continues to be a major consumer of mass timber manufactured elsewhere and today there are no production facilities in our state. In addition to creating value added wood products from smaller diameter lower value logs that result from forest thinning. Master were also has certain structural and building characteristics that are superior to traditional lumber. In cross laminated timber for example the individual pieces are oriented perpendicular to each other resulting in less shrinkage and warping than in traditional lumber. Messed embers also more resistant to fire in earthquakes and traditional lumber. The office of the state fire marshal is currently in the process of adopting already approved international building code standards which allow mass temper buildings to be built up to eighteen storeys high in certain occupancy groups. The office of the state fire marshal anticipates that its code proposals will be heard before the California building standards commission. In July or August of twenty twenty. If approved the new mass timber proposals would become effective July of twenty twenty one following the triennial building code adoption cycle. Encouraging the beneficial you use of force products also helps us advance our state climate goals what is one of the most climate friendly construction materials and existence. Trees a Questor carbon there for directly contributing to the fight against climate change. Living trees and forests are one of the major terrestrial carbon storage pools. The absorb carbon dioxide and major greenhouse gas responsible for climate change and store it as carbon in there would. When trees are harvested and turned into wood products like lumber and plywood the carbon remain sequestered in these wood products for the life of their service in a structure such as a building. It can be upwards of a hundred years. What is a renewable resource when feelings are planted or when trees regenerate naturally in the forest after timber harvester disturbance occurs. A new crop of trees will regrow and continue to sequester carbon. In some there are significant opportunities to de carbonized commercial and residential buildings by building them out of wood instead of concrete and steel. Both of which have a significantly higher carbon footprint than what. Cal fire offers financial support to encourage the economic viability of wood products and bioenergy. Are for south grant funds can be used to pay to remove material from the woods and Holla to processing facility. When part of the funds that are awarded to that project are also used to complete land management work. Recently grant funds have also been used to offer a small low interest loan to a new bio energy facility. This investment in the new facility both decreases hauling distance to that facility. As compared to existing facilities and it promotes a bio energy technology with higher carbon sequestration potential than conventional- bioenergy technologies have. In the right market and business environment economic support could be used to catalyze the development of wood products manufacturing here facilities here in California. Over the long term this would require working with landowners like the USDA Forest Service to ensure a more consistent with supply. And with state business interests such as the governor's office of business and economic development to ensure appropriate economic incentives are available and readily accessible to interested parties. Cal fire looks forward to working with other entities in the state to ensure that the material removing is used in an appropriate way. Thank you so much for the opportunity to testify today and Hogan are happy to answer any questions. Thanks I have a couple of questions and I'll just throw the mountain whoever wants to answer don't feel that you all have to answer were. Little time constraint- my first question is you will mention that the master products are being produced mostly in Oregon and brought here. So is it just a question of us not having the facilities or is there something else going on that makes them- being the place that it's being manufactured rather than in California. I can take a stab at that I'm- on a recent tour that we took of some. Product manufacturing facilities in Oregon. The concern was really about the initial cost to establish the infrastructure in California and interestingly enough while we may have a perception that it's all about regulation in California being an overly regulated state what I actually heard was we're not worried about the regulations we can work with those what we don't have is the you know fifty to maybe a hundred and fifty million dollars. Up front at two sites a construct and locate a facility and get it up and running so from my perspective it's really a question and economics rather than underlying policy or regulatory issues held a did you have a different opinion just add to that I agree with the with that statement in addition. What we heard was that long term raw material supply is extremely important for any large investment like this naturally. And. The concern is being able to secure that kind of raw material supply in California. And the and I think that's pro the same everywhere and I think that's an opportunity for the state to facilitate that kind of arrangement. Great thank you- AB twenty five eighteen requires that on or before July first truth that a twenty twenty the forest management task force. I have to develop a financially viable proposal for the development and construction of at least one new master production- what approaches the task force taking when you're developing the proposal on are you on track to meet the deadline. I'm I would say we are on track to meet the deadline I'm working with the joint wood products institute we're really taking a look at what would be the most logical and frankly. Most feasible to get up and running quickly at the constraint really around. Production of mass timber as I indicated is that initial huge expenditure that's necessary and so part of the conversation really is around. Ways in which the state can assist private industry whether that's a revolving loan fund or some other mechanism AB I bank- to assist private industry in getting a facility up and running. Got it. A Britney if the cut if the Conservancy received more funds from the legislature for grants to support you know innovation of wood products and rural economic development what kind of projects do you think would apply for that and with that support other work that you're doing to any your body Sir projects in mind. Absolutely I mean I think that we have a number with very creative partners in the Sierra Nevada region and people thinking about this all the time about best path forward- I think that we've been able to support a variety of different efforts on both from the work force side and then also from the infrastructure development side and there are a lot of those projects that we could add on to and- building out- there's also new new projects. To come forward and you're like to explore that you're not. Working in now. I have to I'd have to think about that a little bit more and get back to you but I think we have we do have the programs in place and we do have the partnerships in place to be able to. Really get money on the ground quickly and efficiently- but definitely can put a little more thought into specifics and get back to you. Thanks now back to cal fire how many acreage have you guys treated this year and do you feel like you're are you. Know do you know yet whether you're going to meet last year's fuel reduction or- be below that and if so why is that. We specifically for the thirty five emergency projects we are on track to meet our goals. And we. Obviously whether it's a big factor but- week we feel we are on track- we have treated more acres this year than last year and we're seeing es that Lea increasing trend. Together with private landowners- and incentivize saying. This kind of work on private lands- we feel we are on track to meeting our our goals for the five hundred thousand acres okay and last question also for cut for I think for coverage you mention something interesting about the- master producers wanting to make sure that they have a constant stream of material- is that something that's in doubt in California and if so why is that. There's no guarantees in in Oregon and Washington apically you have a- vigorous and demand and supply- equation where this kind of long term guarantee is. Relatively easy to achieve. In in California they will be out of state players will be a new entry into the market and so they have to carve out a niche for themselves to achieve this Connell long term supply so it's by definition going to be a- a bit of a struggle but- we think it's possible with this up because of the nature of is it the operators or is it the nature of the forests or is it what we allow to be harvested. I'm just wondering where that were that issue is I think it's several things it's federal forests have the- largest supply but not necessarily the large someone of a- harvest opportunities. It's is also. Carving out a part of the supply chain which is already spoken for. To other buyers. And it's. Being able to achieve that long term guarantee requires of course funding and investments. I do not think it there is something particularly- challenging about California I do not think it's regulations or policies I think it's just a the nature of the business and if I may madam chair- what we've heard from folks who would like to invest in California is they want to see long term contracts with the federal government owning They're really looking towards long term contracts with the US Forest Service up recently the first twenty year- MO you for supply has been entered into by the US Forest Service and we think now that has actually begun there will be a lot more opportunities for- investors to commit to California. And be able to rely upon those long term supplies. Thank you all really appreciate your time thanks for coming. Our second panel I'd like to welcome you this panel is going to include Glenda Herman's hermits Hermiston. Heather straw and heather strong. And again if you could each just introduce yourself with one or two lines thank you. We love showing off prop yeah I love the process that. Well that's happening- get started up my name is a doctor going to human stern I'm with the university of California agan natural resources- we operate offices all over the state as well as research centers and are deeply engaged in many different aspects of fire forest health as well as economic development and forest products. Of many of the comments in my written testimony echo what you heard in the first panel I won't waste time repeating that other than to just say ditto ditto ditto ditto there right on. I think what myself and my colleague here will focus on or some of the actual products- and I'm gonna jump right into it. Of this this is my only slide on- advance wood products because heather is going to cover that in detail but I did want to emphasize a couple things and I particularly wanted to throw slide up just so people can see a picture. Good we're discovering is one of the room the having a hard time visualizing Cooper talk about when they met him and pulled the buildings. On the vent system again I think federal go into much then then I'm going to the job other than the next slide. It is worth noting that there is a- delay. Or California nothing is because it is part of the solution to these these horrific fire and heavy bio mass on healthy forests. That are wreaking havoc in a variety of other ways including you know water lack of good outdoor recreation and wildlife habitat are damaged by these unhealthy for us as well. Getting the materials out of their into these products of bats going to be the challenge and again I'm not going to spend as much time on mass timber. So let me jump to a nother form of a very high value use of woody biomass. Which is so you lawsuit man of hers. These are ex remotely exile product that is what you have in your hand so. I'm if you look at bottom or you'll be reinforced dent. In auto part of it's K. lore in all US troops have stay in in Afghanistan for several years now long with the gov Lorman real made would be by on yes it does up a bullet. The motor company looking at the auto body parts has been for a few years- basically these materials which have an extremely high tensile strength or basically written to run from. The by us broke down for the murder. Up in the north this Siskiyou county. The proof of concept of going up for some years now about five looking at how you look at the end of your Los reels in cement in a co thanks for. Which the answer back for using ride the of that in some of the research right now as a coating for fruit itself which extends that shelf life and makes it much more a healthy and viable- coverings for bridges an escort there's just read brave used as the this. Tax is to clean IT because you look at the- you'll take me- fibers to cement makes it over 20% stronger as well as much lighter and more elastic and when you think about needing that and buildings not to mention the transportation of those would provide the cement products any distance. There's huge savings there in a variety of different ways. I'm not going to spend a great deal of time on bioplastics except to say that night they mostly because I am not an expert in the field. But I will say that right now we have we are finding. And we use. Our bypass in all of them support stick in fact don't it is oversee eating it is eight that in. Take them. Used petroleum K. made from no matter I'm aye the technology is there for it's not percent prop on the server well on our way we have over three hundred come tearing formula currently producing and manufacturing a wide array of products that have already received the USDA certified bio based product and again these are these are all sorts of materials from cleaners and oils and lubricants- carpets furniture plastics glasses bottles and he's just all over the map it's quite amazing so there's huge opportunities there one of the reasons I initially. Became interested in both so you lawsuit nanofibers and bio plastics was because part of the challenge of getting biomass out of our for us as well as making a profitable use of biomass from other sectors such as agriculture is finding these uses that are much higher value than just burning it up for electricity- as as you may know there is a time and a place for electricity generated from biomass particularly in cho Chen type operations but for the most part it just cannot compete with our their sources of electricity. And then we're left with trying to subsidize it something that many of us do not feel as economically viable in the long run. You've already heard mention of the joint institute for wood products innovation something that was created by both exact border owned with fun I'm from SB eight four nine. Which were excellent belt. All working very closely with the last six of you see two years. Follows up the state government many other partners putting the but Sir. Just a couple quick mentions of us some stuff that's under way right now. Of that I think are pretty interesting of for example you see Merced is working with the super insulated green building technologies LLC which has quite an acronym. Along with T. three energy out of Australia. To develop some highly insulated and load bearing systems for residential construction using wood shavings. Of from bark beetle kill trees they're also developing new technologies working with UC Berkeley and others that will facilitate small scale manufacture of products like glue laminated beams and adapting that technology used in glue lam. To create replacements for cement blocks and blocks utilizing biomass other fully load bearing and have some of the fire. Fire resistant properties you've heard mention elsewhere. I want to highlight that up getting this to move forward as you heard from the previous panel is not necessarily an issue of regulations in many ways it's an issue of how we build economic ecosystem the supply chains around what is needed to get the manufacturing here we have a wide amount of interest I myself have been in conversations with several private sector entities that are seriously looking at starting up manufacturing facilities in California right now but part of the challenges supply chain or financing or knowing where the market is and that's one of the reasons that we're pushing very hard. To really at all of that together at a distance that could not accept a both you see I can natural sort the law with the rural. Counties of. The producers of California. Except for your forward and other. Recent report I called act in which will place not only the need to deal fire. Still room to need to then look the opportunity on jobs and economic development in not only a rural areas although those are definitely a key target for the entire state. Of along with that so a very exciting piece of news that was announced at the summit. That came out of or C. C. was a brand new product what else to. Of with bass told in state actual store is a public benefit non core not. Race that is all about ripping by mass and then put to work they've already got con next to help reduce manufacture ship bands. Looks to hand self could be a. Along with that the help of the very first in the nation. He master George green with the US Forest Service for the entirety of region five which is virtually all of California- this is critical because what RC RC is done here is pull together a wide array of partners that are now involved in identifying the source of the biomass the financing. Of moving it through the supply chain they've made arrangements for the manufacture and the distribution and movement and this is exactly what many of us feel has to happen. In fact- as it shows in this like fear this is something we've been working on for a year after that by will be I mean. You've but on all three of you annals of with a list of players. Looking about. We literally go in there in the end for supply chain be a tent about it. At start up in the first themselves we know the moving bill mass any distance because it's- an eight. Okay but to spend. We've done existing industrial sites all the way up to see a- full file mask old Tom but not you state your first bill the street lights on highways. What we need to do is we need to identify a string of those. This of from south to north that could be serving as early pre processing facilities to take that raw biomass for through its first two or three stages of pre processing unit into a feed stock this been lightly process. So then it then could be transported down into the valley floor and the foot hills where we've got highways and railroads and ports of Stockton another means of moving around and have our manufacturing and then have the market at the other end- SB eight five nine encouraged. Government buildings and state buildings to look at using this materials Washington state has actually moved forward with requiring that and I think that's something this state should certainly be looking up. There are certain about whether these materials it'll initially might be more expensive than conventional although some would say either rapidly closing the gap but that may not be a difference but but let's say for sake of argue there might be we could easily for the first five years well over. The system up and running in getting the manifest string bass bill. The dice difference in those because the materials of cap and it's fun it would be a perfect for them to get the market and this manufacturing base these jobs in these economic development in California. University of California is extremely interested in this this is a conversation we had for over two years now as part president hello Tom knows. The neutral but twenty twenty five should we not of three different campuses look at tall buildings from it would ext us but we're moving rapidly on that. I will close with just that choose from previous books- this is a real proper. In the state if we- really bring all forced together have a TI plant. Brown for. All things being that amount out which gore. Clued select tech G. removed. I think Frazier. About some wonderful tools he's been looking out from Scandinavia but but also- new research new products getting it out so that we've got health your for us more water those jobs and economic development and as you heard previously the buildings themselves or a win win win. I don't know about you but I've rarely seen that many wins possible. Work after route make sure infrastructure the supply chains the work force the research and development all of that the financing all of that's going to be at the table to be part of the solution thank you very much. Okay I do have a presentation here. I let the doctor go away over time because she was so interesting. But if you can okay was it was it was really fantastic but if you can try to keep it. Within the settlement. All the start with my introduction and then we can flip through the first few slides so my name is heather strong. And I'm the western senior director for what works wood products council. So Glenda gave a lot of information on other wood products so I'm gonna talk exclusively about mass temper- so what. What works is a nonprofit organization and we do get our funding from the USDA Forest Service. The softwood lumber board and forestry innovation investment. So we are actually tasked with growing that would. Get sure for non residential construction so focus. Ext silly commercial all tight Michael Jackson. Do so we do go through educating and in private this is for the line construction can be so the map our twenty twenty case event that would work posted. Eat it in all actor but will also hope twenty to thirty eight and their end. Yeah to general director northern California Janelle lad who is here with me today and Microman owski is in southern California and they work directly with the architects engineers and contractors. This is a picture of all of the mass number products that are currently available in the market place you're on an Intel. You have two samples up there with. One of them it process how many timber sample it is the one up on the top row on the right. You have passed wood panel ample water at the bottom right hand side. What. I Mathis timber map search scan all the math are projects that will be are aware. That our current either in doesn't in order to build to the United States so nationally there are center sixty four projects in total. In California you have one hundred master projects that are a cut in line or have built. So such excuse me the minute provide pictures of some of those buildings that are located here in California that have utilized mass temper so the first is a building here in Sacramento. To warehouse artists lost this is. Was could be fourteen. And it you just better L. T. as in. And the rest of it as a friend. It is the first not Commer CE. Then caught yeah. The second project which I know you'll hear about in a little bit it Plumas me bypass boys look in quick California's of the relatively small Marshall ject but it suits me. I'm and used sealed he 41100% of the structure. It was also another first and that it was the first to use CLT as a lateral force resisting system which for the design communities a pretty big deal. So this is genet child care center located south Francisco so this is this is up by child care center. On campus. These are single story bill comes alive process I needed to bring the- tall walls a free. Life for our. Six top- expedition academy located in Truckee California and in this building is to L. T. in the river. And got my native timber and all. Did you says deal is for him at from what we've heard they have plans for some it can all. On campus lies same to assist. The next project is not what library look at and Brent woods all four yes it is a two story library project that use utilize Scott needed. In with the floor. And there are also a building out front that you can see just starting to get free and state that you bill to the rich. We also of that in this the design team second asked project to utilize. Last ember- their first project they utilize CLT in the roof only and we hear that constantly that design teams that work with mass timber. Find that one it's beautiful and two it's quite versatile to work with and so we see them incorporating additional mass timber on subsequent projects. Ice block one is located right downtown here and we're not just blocks away just went through this morning it's a beautiful piece of the in my number. So it it'll aye tongue and groove number in the river and four X. include lamp post and beam name. It had a steep slope of forcing things and also. Into your Lambie staircase. This is a picture of ice block on the left under structure and just of note is the too large. Enough for buildings on one great M. well no and was listed nineteen for maps number project engine I'm not them. Reset and that they have five passed project on the books. The last one highlight is the Christ the light in Oakland California is just beautiful this of large scale first at a huge inspect. Vertical learn actually ban all went. Into the river all construed as I'm being its first cal. What were we- we interface directly on a daily basis with fining construction community we are in here of the her say right to what trying to utilize passed. So as- a list of some of the products we've been on it try to the- sea turtles right sources overcome them. As this year we want to. Educate contracts toward signing caption Atty what we found is a protect engine purrs were very good about this for one design with it. Actor would ask questions like how on earth did this at. Once let so with two tracks toward idea is we have constructing man rent. And installation tracking. So here's a map construction men at work ups that we've together and are we just started first and see all. Up. Last month it out and had a or one third cop actors attended. It taught them things like how to bed it logistically what should they worry about- so just help them to get smart so that we don't lose these to other building materials. The in still in training we've taken a bit of a different approach we've helped develop some curriculum and taken a train the trainer. So we started this Chicago's carpenters union and held their first a hands on instalar workshop in April. And work currently working with it with wet carpenters institute they will host their first one in Q. one of next year. And we've also been talking with a few regional college so that they can take this curriculum and implement it as well the people coming. Out of school there. You did there and he- talked a bit about the C. code changes SO currently would. Map number or like could only be utilized. Where it has ever been able to speak which is six dory's last. For these new. Puzzles will allow you up would to be you and- seven eight teams is my number only. So for the state of California thank the many in a penalty don this and be as the executive order that as it did in two thousand eighteen. That stated that these would proposal from the IDC need to be considered during intervene codes for cap on yet so the discussion currently taking place it appears that it will be on track to get adopted into the twenty ninth California building code into. Into inning code cycle. So they would basic hit the streets for- and be effective alive twenty twenty one. I will tell you there are jurisdictions that are considering these tall buildings ahead of those being adopted. And that is the end of my presentation. Thank you so the buildings that you showed- were a mix of the mass timber and- conventional building materials is there a reason why they did mix them instead of just going full on- master. Yeah there are actually a number of reasons- it probably depends project by project but some of it is because it's a new material sometimes they don't want to take the risk and go all and so they'll do it in a smaller scale. The other thing is- you know what to do I. Believe you should use a proper material for the appropriate space and so sometimes it makes sense to use steeple team and then use a master along with it the other thing that might be a bit of a hurdle that we have yet to overcome. Is that the L. T. is not cc number thrilled at a lateral resist them to eight when bring it seismic so when earns the design in you can use my number. And you can get it approved but it is just that of our process. Update with a code updates affect. Now as you saw there are buildings that have used CLT in the walls but they definitely a require special consideration so you had they're being tested now. That mean that they'll be another code update when that's done it won't be like it's not on the immediate horizon but some of that testing is taking place right here in the state of California at UC San Diego. So you read to support that once that's completed. Someone will ask for to be updated if definitely yeah I went when the information's available I imagine people will be very excited to get that in there you. See L. T. out of a bug infested waters. One can of what works we don't manufacture anything right- there are enough there are a lot there are number of manufacturers and I do know specifically of at least two that have utilized the beetle kill would- in their CLT. And often times they do so at the interior plies because- that would takes on a blue tent- so they do utilize that there are structural viability. Still so structurally it's still so yes. Do bill get lead credit for using CLT. The lead predator it's- you know. I know its- I don't know if they get lead credit per se I know they're there are. I can't speak to that. Typically I do know that there are some regional material credits and some different credits that are conducive to would that depending on where the project is they may or not may or may not qualify as part of the energy efficiency they certainly can use that. Credit they can okay- has anyone quantified how much GHG reduction. Master member can generate Sir any kind of metrics for that. Yeah actually I've seen. Some buildings where they've actually calculated specific it's a building by building thing but it's safe to say a fairly substantial commercial building. Is the equivalent of taking thousands of cars off the road per year. So the big are against the material that I've been seeing and for some reason some popping up on my- social media feeds so I don't know what that's about- targeted ads I think. But a fire safety so how is that been tested and what are the thoughts about fire safety for this material versus concrete or any traditional materials. Well she can offer detail but- one thing I like to tell folks from a policy point of view. Up when the twin towers came down it's because the steel melted. Of this type of wood when it's properly treated and constructed with advanced materials now is extremely fire resistant and actually does perform better than steel in many settings. Yeah I would say it with the trade. The attempt to implement the codes for the seven eighteen story buildings this was a huge concern. So I would just suggest that woods gone through probably more rigorous fire tests and any other building material. That being said mass timber and there that is the only type of technology that will be allowed into the seven to eighteen storeys. Behaves much differently than frame what. And if you consider. Like if you were to- throw a big log on a campfire. It charters around the perimeter which basically creates insulation and keeps the interior cool so even under intense light fires this master Burke and maintain a lot of structural integrity so it's been thoroughly tested. And doctor when I ask you this and you know you know you said you weren't the experts so you don't really have to answer and I know you maybe have a little biased. But I'm just curious by- plastic verses regular plastic- environmentally I know that the I'm told that the bio plastic doesn't really to great in the oceans either. So what are the benefits to it. Will it will degrade- much faster than regular plastic a lot of the issues around for their not bio plastics is more environmentally beneficial gets into transportation and how the products are moved to the supply chain. But what we're talking about here in California of getting biomass into manufacturing fairly quickly with that transport and with. Process vision. To a normal plastics in any life cycle analysis I'm thinking more about the environmental havoc that plastic causes leader in the environment- not to grading even landfill conditions but you know harm to marine animals that sort of thing. What bioplastics does too great a like I said. Many plastics don't great all for hundreds of years it will degrade one of our issues is going to be as we currently have with food waste and other- biodegradable. Is making sure that we're managing that for the potential methane. And folks are looking at that okay. Thank you both really appreciate her information was written super interesting. Okay our last panel. And stakeholder perspectives. We have Jonathan crystal. My friend rich Gordon. Hands are bloom ground Steve Fritsch. Welcome thank you for being here. If you could each just again introduce yourself with one or two lines. And then do your best to keep it under seven minutes each. I am state. You must. Yeah. Part during the two. Sure Friedman thank you very much for holding the hearing it's my pleasure to be a part of it Johnson Q. soul C. R. institute for community and environment a nonprofit organization based in the northern Sierra- we've been around for about twenty five years. I'm gonna quickly run through some slides to share with you what we've been up to our here is that first full cross là. Did to. Bill built in cap corner the are the club corps of. You're either going to play. And all right you see some of those goals are in a safe and stable là and then in the bottom right to see proof all I've layer thick then let stick up a roof panel No tornal structure yes you see some state. It died the thing. Lower left is the route they were believe what people to do they never any in light of they felt like they could work with the material this whole building went up in two days- but there was a fair bit of structural work. For the foundation but it's our impressive it's a beautiful building. And it houses a boiler a black mass. Or the interior of the building it's prop one of the Butte boil buildings you simply have blues and find another. Are the book there is a street and in the right this picture you see what's called a are the unit or in a king. Psych to start with also make it actress. Makes this a combined heat and power for so the- we're pretty excited about what we're able to do with it it heats. The Plumas county health and Human Services center it was funded by the California energy commission and we're about ready to give that building to the county. This whole idea came up a planning process to port the California energy efficient about network of mass boil try to tackle the problem what did it all the spell mass. You see that alright. Our record goal- the Oilers are pretty good for their green. Stack building in the bill that's a by OPG campus or by campus. But was it in camp before talk about that. I want to mention why were folks interested in these biomass burning boilers this is just a simple graph and- the right most. Of the E. Y. at this is Megan I'm spur Cuba meet. And for night in eighty two you can be a dot right ten was an- internet awfully equal nine thousand parts per minute in carbon knocks. You can see it's their most obvious is the client in. This is Kerr by not I'd so oil got term. Skinner over time they've also gotten medical more fit. To these thoughts represent- so folks at the data that. And we more of this and what do so speaks to is died here a week the bill clean boilers Bernie how may. They weren't near clean in the early nineteen eighty you can be that these small scale boilers it also rise are just. As well. Moving on to the can this year. Pick your salute cannabis techno rated in it and Valley in eighteen these closed in the mid eighties enable behind. Rob twenty eight eight bills. Ear institute we just. Bob I show you the lower left sure cuts use all right middle of that the engine the bill right that little to the rectangle the little white is a P. P. substation shows because the per place but pop in the system you can build things that's where they were heading or or putting patterns minutes all up. Mind power also does Rick track. Twenty eight site right pictures without. Any eight in I'm gonna go to this this but hill from there that's. File when you work these prop X. working essentially Burke feels their trip search engine time coming we pretty rate over in Dahle to remediation for light pourtant right here one possible to if you look all the items last edit this particular night. Lot of exiting the dot. Don't go through the other than to say. Whether it's ample our site characterization or developing risk assessment and a room removal action work plan. It's costly but is an opportunity rather than trying to create new sites these old mill sites offer great opportunities for wood utilization. So here we are twenty nineteen clean up in progress five years later. Up. Thirty eight we're excited about being out or do the work. And it is the idea of the campus that had me there's a girl- and portent here is the lies black represent Sherman block if you will green lines are we about Bob mass let's say ten then the line art eat so it about using material about using Tricity it's a- slicing he- the right column of tanks are the different prop X. the peak of it can't. Connect some of the men that came. From a would you patient camp. Renew my energy. We're hoping that upper green some we are on track with the Lassen volcanic national park to develop plant restoration material that would be produced in a greenhouse conceivably on site. And more you also see across laminated timber operation we have talked about that and we have visited- DR Johnson's facility up in Oregon happy to talk about that further I hadn't planned on talking about it but with some of the questions asked- can respond to some of them as well. And here is the first business in poll Hey it's a thing operation because we supply. The sailor and see what it for president. We have. For some of the fat it's going on it in. Fly Valley we also have some material from the campfire that we brought up to make sure that we had drive material last winter like everyone else we had trouble procuring- material that wasn't west. So this is what's powering the boiler and we're hoping to produce- to have a network of boilers and I'm really excited. To say that- I heard this morning that there's a preliminary approval for support for yet another boiler in the town of Quincy through the Sierra Nevada Conservancy. The chipping material the handling. They are well funded by. Service as well they absolute vital interest in helping. Idea to fruition there's a ways to go but up close with just a couple of points. And that is. If we're going to succeed the restoration of forest the point is made by number of four alright. We need new Matt actually first that's awesome to any and then. Also in rural people in later to do it. And we the bill that's going to the- term store. Sec I thank you pleasure to be here thank you. Next panelist thank you I'm sure Friedman- good afternoon I'm rich Gordon and currently service president and CEO of the California forestry association- the fourth we association represents the companies in California- the groceries and produce lumber- we are. Obviously value would as a building product- back we think it has to just a tremendous potential to meet a whole set of climate change goals for California. Would sequesters carbon- and do that when you construct with wood- that clicked carbon stays in the wood for the life of the building- we're also building with the material that is a renewable resource and we can re grow trees. As and so on- the it would has tremendous potential- help us with our climate goals and what has been the primary building material for single family homes. For decades- today now we come to up the possibility these new wood products mass timber- and what mass timber holds potential to- move would beyond just single family home construction- would to it mass timber products are being used around the world- dormitory and- Vancouver British Columbia eighteen stories with wood- office buildings- all across Europe- twelve to eighteen stories. All with wood- so it. It it is a building material for the future it also has great potential for modular construct. And I think if you note. In the slide you just saw of panels being brought in and put in place. You can pre fab- this material and the cost reduction that can occur in building multiple multiple family housing for. Low income housing is tremendous- read reducing construction time in using material that has great benefit. So currently though- and from the buildings you've seen in the slide so far- I think it's safe to say that mass timber really is still a niche product- there are early adopters who are using it experimenting learning about it- I absolutely believe. That we are going to grow rapidly beyond these early adopters- as more and more buildings will be built using mass chamber in California. And the world- and the timber industry wants to be supportive obviously of this effort. The challenge that we perhaps have in California. Is that currently are timber companies- harvest and process to a sustainable level. They meet the requirements of the forest practice rules of California and they do that in a way that sustains of the forests. And we use only the would that they need- at any given time to make sure that they are maintaining their force for future production. So we don't you know go in and take out all the trees up and we are very selective in terms of- the harvesting that we do in the way that we do it. And we're again- essentially at capacity. On private timberlands for production. And that means that in order for California to grow- a woods products industry we've got to look at other sources of supply for material. And has been mentioned previously probably one of the best sources of that is a federal lands that since you own fifty seven percent. Of the force in California. California's also print in in will in some ways from Oregon Washington. And we talked you talked about that earlier- and that is that in Oregon Washington an awful lot of the timber lands are owned by the state government. And here- you know we're about 2% of the timber land on by state government. But in Oregon Washington when they have set a target for more would production. They have been able to do that- by activating their state forests as source of new wood- and so looking at Gen. The California probably is looking at federal timber- for additional supply- the- industry not only aids guaranteed supply. But it needs guaranteed markets and so as the. Mark for timber grows- industry will be more likely to be engaged and invest. Of finally the challenge we all seven California is that. We don't have currently adequate infrastructure- to remove wood from force whether be federal force- or others- the there. Are workforce- has been downsized over the years to meet the production requirements- that the timber companies have in California- we have reduced the number of saw mills we reduced. The number of loggers and so we're operating here in California at a level that essentially meets our sustainable goals- but is difficult to expand those without some additional investment in infrastructure. And knowing that we have adequate of supply an adequate markets. I think that you will see investment in California- in the future in- in New but wood products and in New per- potentials- building and construction you're going to see I think it the possibility of new manufacturing facilities. But it will take some support from the state to get their- I think there's a couple things that the state legislature can do in that regard. One is- I think the take legislature can do whatever it can to encourage the state fire marshal. To adopt the building codes that allow wood construction up to eighteen storeys- state fire marshal the indicated could not so sure that wants to go that far- but I think encouragement from the legislature make sure that we're setting the right tone and saying that we do want to construct with wood in California. For the long haul. The California the legislature could also consider tax incentives. To help create an environment where- industry would invest- in the kinds of brownfields that you've seen. In these sites that exist. In our forced areas of we have land that was once saw mills- land that was once under timber production activity- those could be. Re energized reconverted- and tax incentives might be one pa option- I think also that the legislature. Could continue to promote the use of mass timber and timber in production. Encouraging as was done and- eight fifty nine the for the use of the what is a building material in state buildings- would be a great opportunity for could a bill to the natural resources building. Using mass timber the. That finally I think that yeah the legislature has a role as you're doing here today- in continuing to educate the public. It's important for folks to understand the value of wood. What it can do in terms of our carbon goals what it can do in terms of our greenhouse Gaskell's. Of how it can. Be a beneficial renewable resource a product that produces strong tall buildings. In a product that will bring value to California. So I would encourage the legislature to get up and take a look at that these options- and continue to support would as a viable constructive construction material here in California. Thank you. Thank you Mister Gordon the next panelist please. The final. Sure can you. Give us like. I don't know where he has and to be honest you can either. Public speaking with Michael chairwoman and thank you so much for this opportunity to address the legislature on this important issue- my name is Steve fresh I'm the president of the Sierra business council we work on sustainable economic development issues in the Sierra Nevada. And as you might gas- Forrest forest management wood products and the future of California force a very important to us here in about a communities from both an economic and a cultural perspective. Is this council has been involved in this area for- quite some time we are the small business development center for northeastern California. So many of the proposals we see through our small business development center have some intersect with natural resource management. We also run a climate adaptation and mitigation program that looks at the future of California forest in our region and protracted are projects of vulnerability first year in about a community so- the future the force a very important to the future. Of the vulnerability of the residents of our region. With assistance from the California governor's office of business and economic development we provide direct technical assistance to businesses looking to locate in the Sierra Nevada region- through a technical assistance expansion program that they have we can actually consult with businesses to do financial planning business planning supply analysis and market. Analysis and we have been directly intersecting with a number of businesses looking to locate in the region and doing that kind of analysis for them. We have been partnering for the last three years with the- American renewable power. Who is repurpose saying a twenty megawatt biomass facility located in Loyalton California. And the key concept behind that twenty megawatt facility is essentially co locating a value added wood products campus- with the biomass facility in order to use the waste heat. And the supply chain to stand up by mass based businesses including looking at opportunities for things like cross laminated timber and oriented strand panel were wood panel production. And then finally- as mentioned earlier by Britney Kovic as part of our kind of- work in this area we've also been looking at- workforce employment and training opportunities and I want to zero in. On that issue today because we think there's a tremendous opportunity for employment economic development and- skills building in the north state and the forested regions of the state around wood products and wood product manufacturer. So as you might gas as and as a doctor you missed and pointed out there are a variety of. Import it's Thursday be created out of. Wood thanks I checked the for is active- made for a manager with clues worst mission involves planning look ever be quick operate. Like that. When this these cell which is tracking yes the energy may. I'm secure the whole number well number five kind of yes. Product production and hearing and then the strap and the thing trips that are associated with that. Biofuels man sure which as our chemical engineer. For about out of. Last case says you with. Gen what was op appoint route out I'm sorry your boss the no five that each one goes next buyers don't Xin in a have a playmate. He says it with and then the by fast and consumer products Q. we think it's best a wanted an opportunity for replacing petroleum based products- the answer to a previous question you ask I've been looking into quite a bit lately around- what is the rate of decomposition of different bioplastics compared to petroleum plastics and what I'm discovering that of course a lot of it depends upon- the replacement what is that the material- it's replacing right- but they take be engineered to decompose in about a fifth- of the time and seven products can be engineered to decompose in three to five years which would. Mean that they would be much less long lasting in the environment in in some of those. Applications I think that's a really interesting question. So current employment in California's forest sector see I have a little. Problem there but I'm as part of our work for. An intriguing as you've been looking at the two of is the current employment and for a lot. I am select is actually managing up in those plants I would menu. In all of facilities process when you hope that paper may actually. What for me back in and have and with the based on two thousand and fifteen in a brightly update to that and in nineteen to the may okay growth used and I met model called him and which identifies right now roughly 2% California. Worse your job. It could be the right to do. This eight those second jobs as you might as well see an- option because of what your main picture and. Not because poorest chamber but but it gives you an idea I think of what the current employment sector is and what some of the opportunities might be one and note that these are the direct jobs not the indirect jobs or what's known as the multiplier of fact to give you an idea of what some typical multiplier effects might be in the wood biomass energy industry the typical- calculation is that for every direct job in a facility this roughly three point five jobs in the supply chain. That are stood up by that so if you looked at this and applied a multiplier effect you might be looking at something in the area of two hundred to two hundred and fifty thousand jobs in California I just to let you know you your time is up but wouldn't you see if you can finish up I can finish. Types of jobs with Cisco make two. Recommendations sec. Some specific recommendations in these are hearing a little bit but which had day. I think that this work in the future California there couple things number one we need to hi what. Arts lance. What for echo but you. Can get so a white tent for managing forest products manufactured. Yeah of that of the work that. Out of conserving is due which should improve pro number the ascent seer and it. And we see coming. Really okay what and now it is the issue. Thank supply a time certain ten to twelve years at minimum in order to catch the light private your invest. Increase pourtant. Low cost it'll in. Last night whether that be passed the chore Bob the loan program turn absolute. Says city this is an area of an event for many people and I. Think the one six what they the money for I direct intervention to kick stocks market. District we talked about many of this bio energy bio fuel back for any. Being lower. And the thing that if that will later their Chen include- mandates for certain levels of production or certain levels of consumption for those as as cuenta mentioned that would be very important investment said workforce education and training as we're looking at the work for supply chain here there's very little kind of communication between the different workforce- education and training programs so identifying the gaps and scaling the work force is incredibly important and then measuring the aborted casa co benefits in order to demonstrate. The return on investment the California taxpayers for standing up markets for products like this why is this beneficial to that the tax payer to actually invest in this and what is social economic and environmental benefit that they get from it thank you very much. Thank you Hey last August thank you. When in concert bloom grin- thank you for having me here in my representing the company could tear as a defining us to stakeholders that can help- California- examine this opportunity for mass timber in the in the state I reside in Seattle could tear is a start up company- Silicon Valley start up. Senate headquarters in Menlo Park looking to- it's always humbling to say have been disrupt the construction industry with a new model of and then service provider- across- construction design supply chain and- manufacturing right now we have a five thousand five hundred thousand square foot. Facility in Tracy California just coming online that's making building products. Why I'm here you know- to testify is really I'm a structural engineer that is my background- six is simply to find structural engineering is the design of big things ms my profession is involved in being part of design teams to design complex buildings- the me life safety requirements the building code I am not drawn to technically challenging work in the emergence of mass timber building products and systems for use in these big buildings in North America markets has provided ample opportunity in that regard. So I hope is an engineer occurs at just one point of view the broad number of essential- Forrester frame stakeholders necessary make CLT. Success story in California- the diversity of people it takes to realize this is broad and we need to recognize that. Forced to frame- that phrase is really. The simple term just draw that narrative of understanding that. What starts as a- would in a tree in a forest. Goes through manufacturing to be built on site and you're dealing with stakeholders ago from forest ecology Forest economy. To a developer they want to build for a fee and the builder on site. And it's a you have to understand all to do it right- so here today as being an engineer I want to. Emphasize that point. One way to get into that is we see CLT and I think if you're from a different part of that stakeholder you look at the product and you see it through your lands of. Your area expertise. As a structural engineer and I look at the material- I see that it's comprised of renewable resource. Grown by solar power in which decisions are made- starting at the sawmill or each log from a tree. A is examined in optimally cut to a rectangular cross section to mention. Each interval individual board of lumbers kiln dried. Surfaced in finally evaluated and sorted based on the individual physical and visual characteristics of the board. It's amazing technology. That at my three years ago terror has let me- understand more detail not size. Check split slip of brain warp twist cap when memo we those are words eighties every day in my work. As you start to select what the right type of what is to make the end product based on these rules and sorts each board the sign to stress grade. With specific design values and then these design values- get built up into that engineered specified lay up. This is a three ply CLT Shanshan you can get them in three five seven nine plies different stress grades of lumber different lay up thicknesses if you have to get a catalog. Of your product to really be viable in the market place in here in North America we can learn from Europe. We're in a sense stages of defining what that standardized product here is for us- and so in turn then that product has its own design values is an engineer we have to have the building code in the requirements so we can specify the product properly. And make market competitive building. In Iraq use. So in in making CLT I nothing's chemically change in the material you can still see the growth rings in material when you look at the end of it. It's. The process of making seal T. takes naturally variable would from any from nature and turns it into technology. With defined and reliable engineering properties it's remarkable material here to terror I work I've been offered- great opportunity to work at a company that has conceived and built a two hundred seven thousand square foot CLT factory in Spokane valley Washington. Over the past three years. And as of July the factories been operational making could tears first- certified product line our factories located on the edge of a large force plans news or near sawmill part first. To the north and east extending up to British Columbia and Alberta we are well positioned with good road and rail access from the sawmills to our factory an intern good rail and road access. From our factories to the largest markets up and down the west coast from- thank you for British Columbia to San Diego. The location are fact exist as well the higher the experience we need from forest's industry as well as the component design computer numerical control programmers. And other in the technology sector there I have to be in our factory because the way the materials fabricated uses state of the art. G. in this experience much else is gonna determine the best sawmill lumber specification for sourcing that on his performance which I care about. And cost which everybody cares about the raw material. Key aspects of the spend. Them but- you have to look at your lumbar species company. For local to your sawmills you know the region alligator what's Beach is an option. To terra is supplying from Canada to fear factory in Spokane. Because of the S. P. F. species group combination was- the selected as our first- you're working with sawmills the make lumber. That's an attribute. A two by six five quarter by six board stock different lamination thicknesses- which can come from small diameter trees. Is part of the analysis lumber stress grade there's visual grades there's mechanically rated grades you have to get into that specification. The wood is kiln dried but it's a keeping you discover- the specification for steel T. is different than lumber you have to have dryer would. You need other very- characteristics in that product that are hard for a sawmill that's in production today servicing. Lumber the mighty home depot these little changes that we want of all the little are not little to the- manufacturing facility. You need to get stakeholders involved early to get some of this mapped out- because early adopters amassed timber- aren't a big enough market for big sawmills to change their practice to meet our needs. So you have to you have to work together- and in the case could tear this needs to be delivered a high volume- when at capacity our plans going to manufacture up to hundred eighty thousand cubic metres of CLT every year. That's roughly eleven million square feet of five five four product. In a viable business plan for CLT factors highly dependent on lumber sourcing strategy is roughly 7280% of manufacture cost. Is the wood fiber itself which makes sense because it's 99% would. So at the project scale frame I'm a building engineer okay effected terrace first commercial mass timber building. Called catalyst it's under construction right now located in Spokane Washington it's five story- hundred fifty thousand square foot mixed used office education building there would be least eastern Washington university starting in the fall. Of twenty twenty it was a private development. From the foundation up or the entire building in the exterior facade is supported by a mass timber structural frame frame CLT floors glam beam CLT sure walls. Glenn columns and seal T. exterior facade panels it's all wood in it she is a market viable thirty by thirty foot calling great spacing. The majority the wood in the interior spaces will be exposed making it a beautiful place to work. But more importantly it's been engineered to me. I'll building code requirements for structural. Uber and acoustic fire safety standpoint. All the CLT elements and glamour fabricated offsite musings through. And see. On G. direct from the files from the design teams ready to ship in a sample onsite. No chainsaws allowed on say is the aim you're not you don't cut the wood on say- to bad day when you do this building exemplifies that would is the easiest material fabricate and build with. Even that big scale. Which is. So different. Reporter like charities catalyst building is a demonstration of how to quantify the embodied environmental impact of the- of the building materials using. Used including our seal to product line to this we have third party consulted with Cartman carbon leadership forum. And school of forestry at the university of Washington he is life cycle counting methods that are now recognized by- green buildings earthquake certification programs such as the lead program. And in that metric of measuring things in comparing against other buildings you constructed account for carbon storage. And the other benefits of would. Lastly compared to tears committed to sourcing our lumber from responsibly managed forests to meet the specifications from our customers we are currently registry CLT factory the chain of custody certified. That's a five P. F. C. N. F. S. C. so finish good product can be sold with these credentials. In conclusion if you respect the material use it technically CLT is a technology that enables whole new ways to design fabricate deliver build environmentally responsible buildings that people benefit from living. And working in. I think thank you very much. So was it hard to get lead to work with lead on this or do they already have sort of a matter. Of how they- yeah. Lead version for. Which came of years ago and when it comes out it's not formally adopted some projects but it generally it is. That accounts for a whole building at CA which is what I describe. As a means to. Get points in the system is set up to. Encourage that kind of pushed some of the builders. Who want to serve. Kind of. Charter sort of the educate it's an education to the developer and one issue with carbon in the what that means the developer you know we don't have we have water meters we have gas meters we have electrical meters on our buildings which have a return on investment for developer carbon doesn't have that hook so I have not seen employed too much- in the rear view mirror but looking forward in the future on- people understanding operational energy of a building is that something we need reduce but to be truly not zero you have to look at the body then fax. Of your structure how much energy and carbon intensive and what are the to the city of the materials going in your building that's that is the conversation I moving forward when you see architect and engineer specifying the set environmental impact of the building materials which is right in the center where the wood. The maximum amount is operated. For this so yeah but that's great. For if you're a builder and you're trying to get leads over certified building or gold or platinum. Is this something now that would pop out as a way to help get you there. Three it's there it's an opportunity. The specialist consultant to do the work in the feet it takes to do that might be a barrier. Okay thanks. So I have a question I think for the two of you which is you know there is a tension between the bio mass generation and you know utilizing the material. For the mask timber and I know that. There are some stakeholders that are concerned that if we build a lot of broilers. Boilers and we- you know do more generation plants that they'll be more reason to use more materials. For generation rather than for timber products so do you see that man how do you if you're doing a- of. A boiler on site and you also have your timber manufacture on site is there sort of a tension between those or is it only that. Your timber manufactures again take best mature all the materials to for that and it's kind of whatever they can't use and is used for the generation. The latter. So that the what normally happens in the way that we look at this is if you can make use of the lowest value product the lowest value materials the waste would if you will. 185% of which is not going into any wood products your that's that's the material that's appropriate for biomass utilization and as I think everyone knows it's a heck of a lot better to burn it in a boiler with pollution control equipment. Than it is to have open pile burning for us so it is a matter of getting it to sight utilizing and when we talk about a wood utilization campus. We talk about sort. Site to get things into their highest how you use and that can involve the whole of the products so. We've ever seen it as the tension so that's gonna that's a site where you have several different types facilities what about in places where they only have. They're only doing generation but they're not doing production is that then become an issue. It can be if you're using larger material that can be used for lumber or for cross laminated timber or mass timber it can be an issue absolutely yep I might weigh in on that I think this is one of the reasons why we think we have to be very clear from the beginning that the goal is Forest restoration. Is ecological management of our forests and have some way to measure manage that and ensure that so that the materials that are coming off that are used for bio energy are essentially a waste product they are essentially a co benefit of achieving an ecological restoration objective not the other way around. So that would imply that these sort of sub campus models where the highest value product goes for embodied carbon in buildings and other things and really bio energy is a waste product where you can capture the heat and use the heat to divert other fossil fuel. General it embodied energy would would be the best approach to take if you were co locating facilities in a forested landscape and then one final element of that I think Jonathan hit on something really important right now the alternative is essentially. That waste product being open pile burned in forests in California- and the criteria air pollution emission reduction from from diverting that- material to a bio mass facility is roughly 97% of the criterion air pollutants are eliminated by diverting it to a facility so. It makes sense from an air quality perspective first the supply issue is concerned I don't think we're- beginning to Dân. The supply of high hazard sounded very high hazard zone material that was recently identified in analysis done- across the state- that showed literally hundreds of millions of tons of material needed to be removed. Rich would you have particular members in your association that are interested in mass chamber. Many other certain are there certain members that are just ready to go there. I would say the there are members that are excited interested in exploring- whether they would go there tomorrow. Probably not a and again it goes back to this issue of. If they were going to convert to a in existing sawmill or add to the facility necessary to make across laminated timber. Of that said a long term investment- you're gonna need to get loans from the banks the banks are going to want to know that. That's gonna pencil out over ten twenty years it seems like we've got this you know huge future everybody's all the cool architecture using it and you're about to have this new building standards and go to eighteen stories and it's cheaper. So what why still this hesitation I mean I'm not and you know I'm not an investor but I was investor I kind of feel like one of the first in on this it just seems you know almost too good to be true. So why are they still hesitating. Well I think are you still hesitating I'm. I guess the way would answer that is this. Currently the timber companies in California. Primarily producing lumber from their own Forest stock. And they're doing that at a level that is sustainable- for their lands. The capacity for them to take additional stock off their lands and maintain their sustainability is minimal. Therefore they need assurance that there is material from elsewhere not coming off their own lands they any material from the federal for us from private other private non industrial landowners of developing those relationships getting those securities in place. Are the critical component for moving a cross limited timber a production activity forward in California- so it is the surely. Of supply that is critical- I believe that were very close to sure de of market as you describe what's happening- those are the two elements that are gonna be critical and in the final piece is- the additional infrastructure that been talked about this afternoon relative to work force- so workforce investment is also very important. Of the final piece of that puzzle- but I believe that we will get there and- I believe that we will have a cross Limón a timber- activity a complete factory. Here in California- before long- but it will take- some investment in in figuring out how do we make sure that we have long term supply. May I add to that briefly here. We visited the DR Johnson Millen riddle Oregon we spent the day with Valerie Johnson the owner of that and she told the story of how in sitting with twenty other folks a ministry the said who's ready to make this and nobody step forward. Immediately and she said we can do it. But then she told the story takes a number of years to perfect the product it's not like making a two by four two by six piece of lumber it's about the structural integrity of the material which needs to be repeatedly tested and that's a that's an involved process such as an expense associated. And a time lag associated with that and I just want to underscore what rich pointed out. What she also said you have a challenge like we have here in rural California a riddle Oregon and that is the work force so we have to continue to build the capacity of the work force to do that work. On it let me just ask I mean us Hans ensure structural engineer about the earthquake issues- is this yeah that's a fair question I'd- yeah I am now sitting on the codes and standards that develops this at the national level for the international building code work. There is a- and I got to speak in July- to the California fair group that's considering the new code language. Sell there is a- at the end of next year the twenty twenty one. Provision of the code will have a first CLT sure Wall assuming the votes come together it's sense of bass process. So that's work that's done today on on using CLT as a as a sheer wall system. It's still have limitations up to I think five stories tall but it's a very. Hello the new lateral systems to get in the building code to have to go through a many years of testing and development. And so that's the good news I'm also on researchers to Colorado State University Kalra spuul minds. There. Colorado school of mines there's- there's in next generation- systems coming out so the next one three six years. Next goofed to code cycles of systems will be code five. Three six your code cycles we should have more systems. In play in defining the building code. But thank you they want to thank the panel I wanna thank all of our panels- this is been really interesting and certainly give our committee a lot of work to do and next year too. I'm never gonna move to public comments I'm ask the members of the public to keep their comments to two minutes. Three are running. A little bit late anybody would like to comment please line up. Hey nobody of no one stands up I'm gonna bang the gavel. Okay looks like we've we answered all of the concerns in the comments and anybody in the public could possibly ever have so thank you all again for coming and these this meeting is adjourned
