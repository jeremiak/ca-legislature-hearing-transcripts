00:31:01.393 --> 00:31:05.530 region:rollup2
STAFF RUSHED TO PROVIDE PRIMARY

00:31:03.895 --> 00:31:07.165 region:rollup2
CARE ANYWAY THEY COULD. AND WE

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:09.000 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATELY TRY TO RESTORE THE

00:31:07.165 --> 00:31:10.736 region:rollup2

PATIENT'S RELIED ON.

00:31:10.736 --> 00:31:14.306 region:rollup2
BUT AS I SIT HERE TODAY THE

00:31:12.571 --> 00:31:16.074 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF PHARMACY ACCESS IS

00:31:14.306 --> 00:31:17.275 region:rollup2
STILL NOT WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE.

00:31:16.074 --> 00:31:20.579 region:rollup2

00:31:17.275 --> 00:31:22.280 region:rollup2
NEED HAVE TAKEN FAR TOO LONG.

00:31:20.579 --> 00:31:23.215 region:rollup2
WHILE EXISTING LAW ALREADY HAS

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.549 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT ALLOWANCES FOR

00:31:27.052 --> 00:31:29.621 region:rollup2
THERE WAS NOT CLEAR ENOUGH

00:31:28.019 --> 00:31:31.223 region:rollup2
GUIDANCE IN THE LAW AS IT

00:31:29.621 --> 00:31:32.124 region:rollup2

PEOPLE THAT I SEE THIS IS

00:56:09.499 --> 00:56:11.668 region:rollup2
SOMEWHAT ROUGHLY ANALOGOUS TO

THAT EXPLAINS PART OF THE

00:56:40.464 --> 00:56:43.367 region:rollup2

CHAIRMAN BORIS.

01:04:57.327 --> 01:05:01.197 region:rollup2
AS MOST OF YOU BY NOW KNOW THAT

01:04:59.529 --> 01:05:03.166 region:rollup2
I HAD MY DAUGHTER VIA C.

01:05:01.197 --> 01:05:04.701 region:rollup2
SURROGATE.

01:05:03.166 --> 01:05:06.669 region:rollup2
AND WHEN I MET MY SURROGATE WE

01:05:04.701 --> 01:05:07.737 region:rollup2
HAD THIS GREAT CAMARADERIE AND

01:05:06.669 --> 01:05:09.339 region:rollup2
AS WE WERE I WAS WALKING BACK TO

01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:11.641 region:rollup2
MY CAR SHE SAID OH AND BY THE

01:05:09.339 --> 01:05:13.643 region:rollup2
WAY. I LIKE TO HAVE MY CHILDREN.

01:05:11.641 --> 01:05:15.612 region:rollup2
WITH THE MIDWIFE.

01:05:13.643 --> 01:05:16.613 region:rollup2
AND ICE NODDED AND I SMILED AND

01:05:15.612 --> 01:05:18.448 region:rollup2
I WALKED TO THE CAR AND I GOT TO

01:05:16.613 --> 01:05:20.083 region:rollup2
THE CAR AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF

01:05:18.448 --> 01:05:22.285 region:rollup2
WHAT IS A MIDWIFE.

01:05:20.083 --> 01:05:24.487 region:rollup2
I HAD NO IDEA.

01:05:22.285 --> 01:05:26.990 region:rollup2
BUT I SOON LEARNED.

01:05:24.487 --> 01:05:28.158 region:rollup2
MIDWIVES ARE EXTRAORDINARY.

01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:28.992 region:rollup2
AND WORKING WITH ONE IS AN

01:05:28.158 --> 01:05:30.860 region:rollup2
ENRICHING AN EXTRAORDINARY

01:05:28.992 --> 01:05:32.662 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE.

01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:33.963 region:rollup2
I.

01:05:32.662 --> 01:05:35.265 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ASKED ME WHY I'VE BEEN SO

01:05:33.963 --> 01:05:35.865 region:rollup2
COMMITTED TO THIS ISSUE THREE

01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:38.201 region:rollup2
AND A HALF YEARS LATER HERE I

01:05:35.865 --> 01:05:40.570 region:rollup2
AM.

01:05:38.201 --> 01:05:42.205 region:rollup2
AND ALL I CAN SAY IS THIS.

01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:44.007 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU SHOW RESPECT FOR THE

01:05:42.205 --> 01:05:45.341 region:rollup2
PERSON WHO GAVE THEIR BODY?

01:05:44.007 --> 01:05:47.644 region:rollup2
SO THAT YOU COULD HAVE THE

01:05:45.341 --> 01:05:48.912 region:rollup2
GREATEST GIFT OF YOUR.

01:05:47.644 --> 01:05:50.780 region:rollup2
YOU MAKE SURE THAT SHE ALWAYS

01:05:48.912 --> 01:05:52.415 region:rollup2
HAS THE CHOICE WHEN IT COMES TO

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:55.118 region:rollup2
HER BODY. HOW SHE CONTINUES TO

01:05:52.415 --> 01:05:57.253 region:rollup2
GET THAT GIFT?

01:05:55.118 --> 01:05:58.922 region:rollup2
SO LIKE I SAID HERE I AM. THE

01:05:57.253 --> 01:06:00.857 region:rollup2
THIRD YEAR IN A ROW.

01:05:58.922 --> 01:06:04.594 region:rollup2
FOR WHAT I BELIEVE WILL BE THE

01:06:00.857 --> 01:06:05.695 region:rollup2
LAST TIME. IN THIS COMMITTEE.

01:06:04.594 --> 01:06:06.796 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK YOU GUYS FROM MY

01:06:05.695 --> 01:06:09.165 region:rollup2
AUNT FOR YOUR INDULGENCE OVER

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:10.266 region:rollup2
THIS LAST THREE YEARS.

01:06:09.165 --> 01:06:12.035 region:rollup2
BUT WE ARE AT A TIPPING POINT IN

01:06:10.266 --> 01:06:13.503 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:06:12.035 --> 01:06:15.238 region:rollup2
RISING HEALTHCARE COSTS CONTINUE

01:06:13.503 --> 01:06:16.573 region:rollup2
TO BURDEN WORKING PEOPLE.

01:06:15.238 --> 01:06:17.874 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE IS NOT A

01:06:16.573 --> 01:06:19.309 region:rollup2
REALITY FOR ALL OF OUR

01:06:17.874 --> 01:06:20.610 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES. AND WE HAVE A

01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:22.345 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT SHORTAGE OF

01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:24.614 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS.

01:06:22.345 --> 01:06:26.716 region:rollup2
THERE ARE TWO OPTIONS.

01:06:24.614 --> 01:06:28.384 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO DO NOTHING

01:06:26.716 --> 01:06:29.352 region:rollup2
AND LET MARKET WORK ITSELF OUT.

01:06:28.384 --> 01:06:29.886 region:rollup2
OR WE CAN TAKE IMMEASURABLE

01:06:29.352 --> 01:06:32.422 region:rollup2
ACTION TO MAKE THE SYSTEM

01:06:29.886 --> 01:06:33.590 region:rollup2
BETTER.

01:06:32.422 --> 01:06:34.123 region:rollup2
WE CAN GIVE PEOPLE FIGHTING

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:35.325 region:rollup2
CHANCE TO SEE HEALTH CARE

01:06:34.123 --> 01:06:36.860 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONALS.

01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:38.328 region:rollup2
WE CAN ENSURE ACCESS TO QUALITY

01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:39.729 region:rollup2
CARE IS NOT JUST A POLITICAL

01:06:38.328 --> 01:06:41.264 region:rollup2
TALKING POINTS.

01:06:39.729 --> 01:06:43.700 region:rollup2
BUT AN ACTION THAT WE ARE TAKING

01:06:41.264 --> 01:06:45.902 region:rollup2
AND WORKING TOWARDS.

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:47.203 region:rollup2
LIKE I SAID EARLIER I SPENT MY

01:06:45.902 --> 01:06:48.771 region:rollup2
LAST THREE YEARS HERE IN THE

01:06:47.203 --> 01:06:50.406 region:rollup2
LEGISLATOR FIGHT LEGISLATURE

01:06:48.771 --> 01:06:50.974 region:rollup2

BETTER.

01:06:56.479 --> 01:06:58.214 region:rollup2
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT IT

01:06:57.647 --> 01:07:01.117 region:rollup2
TAKES TO BECOME A CERTIFIED

01:06:58.214 --> 01:07:02.018 region:rollup2

BECOMING A CERTIFIED NURSE

01:08:07.717 --> 01:08:10.787 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES CNN TO

IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE MADE SOME

AMAZING PROGRESS IN REGARDS TO

01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:43.332 region:rollup2

FOUR TIMES THAT OF WHITE WITH.

01:11:48.604 --> 01:11:51.641 region:rollup2
CAESAREAN SECTION IS NOW THE

01:11:50.173 --> 01:11:53.376 region:rollup2
MOST COMMON HOSPITAL SURGERY AND

01:11:51.641 --> 01:11:54.744 region:rollup2
PRETERM BIRTH THE LEADING CAUSE

01:11:53.376 --> 01:11:56.245 region:rollup2
OF DEATH OF CHILDREN UNDER FIVE

01:11:54.744 --> 01:11:58.047 region:rollup2
IS INCREASING AND CALIFORNIA

01:11:56.245 --> 01:11:59.615 region:rollup2
AFTER YEARS OF DECLINE.

01:11:58.047 --> 01:12:00.683 region:rollup2
ADD TO THIS CRISIS THE SEVERE

01:11:59.615 --> 01:12:02.451 region:rollup2
AND WORSENING SHORTAGE OF OB

01:12:00.683 --> 01:12:03.553 region:rollup2
CHAINS THROUGHOUT THE STATE NINE

01:12:02.451 --> 01:12:05.254 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA COUNTIES HAVE NO

01:12:03.553 --> 01:12:07.123 region:rollup2
OBSTETRICIAN AT ALL NINETEEN

01:12:05.254 --> 01:12:08.391 region:rollup2
COUNTIES HAVE FIVE OR FEWER.

01:12:07.123 --> 01:12:09.025 region:rollup2
AND THERE HAS BEEN NO INCREASE

01:12:08.391 --> 01:12:11.093 region:rollup2
IN THE NUMBER OF OBSTETRICIANS

01:12:09.025 --> 01:12:12.495 region:rollup2
TRAIN SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY.

01:12:11.093 --> 01:12:14.297 region:rollup2
TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM EIGHTY

01:12:12.495 --> 01:12:15.097 region:rollup2
TWO SIX EIGHT TWO SIX TO REMOVE

01:12:14.297 --> 01:12:16.532 region:rollup2
THE SUPERVISORY TETHER FROM

01:12:15.097 --> 01:12:17.133 region:rollup2
NURSE MIDWIFERY PRACTICE.

01:12:16.532 --> 01:12:18.568 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE CAN GO WHERE WE ARE

01:12:17.133 --> 01:12:20.036 region:rollup2
NEEDED.

01:12:18.568 --> 01:12:21.771 region:rollup2
AS OTHER STATES HAVE PROVEN

01:12:20.036 --> 01:12:23.406 region:rollup2
PHYSICIAN SUPERVISION DOES NOT

01:12:21.771 --> 01:12:24.740 region:rollup2
IMPROVE SAFETY NOR OVERSIGHT.

01:12:23.406 --> 01:12:25.942 region:rollup2
THE DATA CLEARLY REVEALED THAT

01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:27.176 region:rollup2
RURAL AND HEALTH PROVIDER

01:12:25.942 --> 01:12:28.711 region:rollup2
SHORTAGE AREAS FOR SUFFERING THE

01:12:27.176 --> 01:12:29.912 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES OF THIS

01:12:28.711 --> 01:12:32.381 region:rollup2
WE ARE FAILING WOMEN AND BABIES

01:12:29.912 --> 01:12:33.416 region:rollup2
IN THESE AREAS.

01:12:32.381 --> 01:12:34.917 region:rollup2
YOU COULD EVEN SAY THAT OUR

01:12:33.416 --> 01:12:35.985 region:rollup2
UNWILLINGNESS TO INTEGRATE NURSE

01:12:34.917 --> 01:12:37.687 region:rollup2
MIDWIVES TO IMPROVE THE

01:12:35.985 --> 01:12:39.589 region:rollup2
MATERNITY CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM

01:12:37.687 --> 01:12:41.190 region:rollup2
IN THESE PLACES THAT NEED IT

01:12:39.589 --> 01:12:42.692 region:rollup2
MOST IS IN FACT HARMING WOMEN.

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:44.527 region:rollup2
MY HOPE TODAY IS THAT YOU WILL

01:12:42.692 --> 01:12:45.795 region:rollup2
SEE THE URGENCY OF THIS CRISIS.

01:12:44.527 --> 01:12:47.263 region:rollup2
TO SIMPLY CONTINUE AS WE ARE

01:12:45.795 --> 01:12:48.798 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY MEANS WE ARE OKAY

01:12:47.263 --> 01:12:50.132 region:rollup2
WITH THE STATUS QUO. WHAT DOES

01:12:48.798 --> 01:12:52.235 region:rollup2
THAT SAY ABOUT HOW WE VALUE

01:12:50.132 --> 01:12:53.302 region:rollup2
WOMEN AND FAMILIES?

01:12:52.235 --> 01:12:54.670 region:rollup2
NURSE MIDWIVES ARE THE HIGHEST

01:12:53.302 --> 01:12:56.105 region:rollup2
EDUCATED AND MOST WELL TRAINED

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:57.707 region:rollup2
MIDWIVES IN THE WORLD WE EXCEED

01:12:56.105 --> 01:12:59.275 region:rollup2
ALL INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS WE

01:12:57.707 --> 01:13:00.943 region:rollup2
HAVE LOWER MATERNAL AND INFANT

01:12:59.275 --> 01:13:02.645 region:rollup2
DEATH RATES LOWER PRETERM BIRTH

01:13:00.943 --> 01:13:03.646 region:rollup2
RATES LOWER SYRIAN RATES.

01:13:02.645 --> 01:13:05.481 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE FOCUS ON PREVENTION

01:13:03.646 --> 01:13:06.616 region:rollup2
AND WELLNESS BE.

01:13:05.481 --> 01:13:08.184 region:rollup2
WE TYPICALLY WORK IN LOW

01:13:06.616 --> 01:13:09.886 region:rollup2
RESOURCE AREAS AND WITH MEDICAID

01:13:08.184 --> 01:13:11.687 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS WHERE ONE WOULD

01:13:09.886 --> 01:13:12.221 region:rollup2
EXPECT TO HAVE POOR OUTCOMES BUT

01:13:11.687 --> 01:13:15.258 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT SO WITH NURSE

01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:16.592 region:rollup2
MIDWIFERY.

01:13:15.258 --> 01:13:17.393 region:rollup2
IF YOU HEAR ONE THING TODAY

01:13:16.592 --> 01:13:19.061 region:rollup2

01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:20.997 region:rollup2

CULTIVATORS FACE VERY DIFFERENT

01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:02.530 region:rollup2
ISSUES BOTH SEGMENTS CAN BENEFIT

THESE ARE THE TRADITIONAL SMALL

01:30:18.213 --> 01:30:20.315 region:rollup2
THE INDOOR COMMISSION OR

REPRESENT INDOOR CANNABIS

01:30:20.315 --> 01:30:24.152 region:rollup2
CULTIVATORS IN CALIFORNIA INDOOR

01:30:22.317 --> 01:30:26.588 region:rollup2
CULTIVATIONS REPRESENT EIGHTY

01:30:24.152 --> 01:30:27.956 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE PRODUCTION IN

01:30:26.588 --> 01:30:29.724 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA TODAY. THEY HAVE A

01:30:27.956 --> 01:30:30.992 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF REGULATORY AND MARKET

01:30:29.724 --> 01:30:32.694 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT COULD BE ADDRESSED

01:30:30.992 --> 01:30:34.029 region:rollup2
BY THE COMMISSION.

01:30:32.694 --> 01:30:36.131 region:rollup2
I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO A FEW

01:30:34.029 --> 01:30:37.098 region:rollup2
ISSUES RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS.

01:30:36.131 --> 01:30:38.767 region:rollup2
FIRST IS THE.

01:30:37.098 --> 01:30:41.102 region:rollup2
CONCERNED THAT THE COMMISSIONS

01:30:38.767 --> 01:30:42.270 region:rollup2
ARE NOT APPROPRIATE THIS TIME

01:30:41.102 --> 01:30:44.739 region:rollup2
BECAUSE CANNABIS CULTIVATION IS

01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:47.809 region:rollup2
A PARTICULARLY VOLATILE SECTOR.

01:30:44.739 --> 01:30:49.811 region:rollup2
IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT CDFA.

01:30:47.809 --> 01:30:50.979 region:rollup2
STATES THAT THE NINETEEN THIRTY

01:30:49.811 --> 01:30:52.447 region:rollup2

01:30:50.979 --> 01:30:54.916 region:rollup2
CREATION OF COMMISSIONS

01:30:52.447 --> 01:30:56.418 region:rollup2
WAS ESTABLISHED AND I QUOTE. TO

01:30:54.916 --> 01:30:58.219 region:rollup2
BRING STABILITY TO AGRICULTURAL

01:30:56.418 --> 01:30:59.321 region:rollup2
MARKETS.

01:30:58.219 --> 01:31:00.555 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION THE GROWERS IN THE

01:30:59.321 --> 01:31:01.389 region:rollup2
CANNABIS INDUSTRY WILL HAVE

01:31:00.555 --> 01:31:03.224 region:rollup2
FINAL SAY ON ESTABLISHING A

01:31:01.389 --> 01:31:04.292 region:rollup2
COMMISSION.

01:31:03.224 --> 01:31:05.860 region:rollup2
WHEN IMPLEMENTATION VOTE IS PUT

01:31:04.292 --> 01:31:07.095 region:rollup2
BEFORE THEM.

01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:08.930 region:rollup2
AS YOU'LL HEAR FURTHER TODAY

01:31:07.095 --> 01:31:09.597 region:rollup2
FROM FARMERS THEMSELVES THE TWO

01:31:08.930 --> 01:31:11.399 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONS.

01:31:09.597 --> 01:31:12.233 region:rollup2
ARE NEEDED FOR TO HELP THEIR

01:31:11.399 --> 01:31:13.835 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO HELP MEET THEIR

01:31:12.233 --> 01:31:15.537 region:rollup2
CONCERNS.

01:31:13.835 --> 01:31:16.104 region:rollup2
AND ULTIMATELY ALSO WHY CREATE

01:31:15.537 --> 01:31:17.539 region:rollup2
TWO COMMISSIONS FOR THE SAME

01:31:16.104 --> 01:31:19.007 region:rollup2
CROP.

01:31:17.539 --> 01:31:19.874 region:rollup2
THE ANSWER TO THAT IS WHY THE

01:31:19.007 --> 01:31:21.276 region:rollup2
COMMISSION STRUCTURE WAS CREATED

01:31:19.874 --> 01:31:22.777 region:rollup2
N LAW.

01:31:21.276 --> 01:31:27.015 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONS CAN BE DESIGNED TO

01:31:22.777 --> 01:31:28.383 region:rollup2
pFARMERS PAIN THE ASSESSMENTS.

01:31:27.015 --> 01:31:29.451 region:rollup2
IN THIS EXAMPLE SON GROWN IN

01:31:28.383 --> 01:31:31.453 region:rollup2
INDOOR CULTIVATORS GROW THE SAME

01:31:29.451 --> 01:31:35.357 region:rollup2
CROP.

01:31:31.453 --> 01:31:36.191 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN YOU ARE.

WE'D DO YOU CURRENTLY MAKE US

01:33:02.977 --> 01:33:06.381 region:rollup2
PROBABLY EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE

01:48:42.316 --> 01:48:46.253 region:rollup2
THEIR LICENSE SO NINETY NINE

01:48:44.184 --> 01:48:47.521 region:rollup2
PERCENT. OF THOSE.

01:48:46.253 --> 01:48:49.023 region:rollup2
APPLICANTS THAT DO HAVE A

01:48:47.521 --> 01:48:50.824 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL RECORD WHO APPLIED TO

01:48:49.023 --> 01:48:52.559 region:rollup2
CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD

01:48:50.824 --> 01:48:54.094 region:rollup2
ARE BEING LICENSED OR.

01:48:52.559 --> 01:48:55.329 region:rollup2
IT POTENTIALLY A A CONDITIONAL

01:48:54.094 --> 01:48:57.598 region:rollup2
LICENSE.

01:48:55.329 --> 01:48:59.733 region:rollup2
SO OUR CONCERN IS THAT.

01:48:57.598 --> 01:49:02.069 region:rollup2
THIS BILL IS A KIND OF A ONE

01:48:59.733 --> 01:49:03.437 region:rollup2
SIZE FITS ALL IT DOES NOT

01:49:02.069 --> 01:49:04.738 region:rollup2
REFLECT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

01:49:03.437 --> 01:49:06.039 region:rollup2
THE FORTY DIFFERENT BOARDS AND

01:49:04.738 --> 01:49:08.008 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONS THAT ARE ALL UNDER

01:49:06.039 --> 01:49:09.343 region:rollup2
THE PART OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. IT

01:49:08.008 --> 01:49:10.644 region:rollup2
WOULD TAKE AN EXISTING PROGRAM

01:49:09.343 --> 01:49:11.979 region:rollup2
THAT SEEMS TO BE WORKING WELL

01:49:10.644 --> 01:49:14.815 region:rollup2
BOTH FOR THE CONTRACTOR

01:49:11.979 --> 01:49:16.183 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY THE CONSUMERS AND THE

01:49:14.815 --> 01:49:17.084 region:rollup2
OFFENDERS WHO ARE APPLYING FOR A

01:49:16.183 --> 01:49:19.520 region:rollup2
LICENSE.

01:49:17.084 --> 01:49:20.421 region:rollup2
AND REPLACING IT WITH A A NEW

01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:22.089 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

01:49:20.421 --> 01:49:25.159 region:rollup2
AT COST TO THE STATE.

01:49:22.089 --> 01:49:26.693 region:rollup2
AND A POTENTIALLY A DELAY IN AS

01:49:25.159 --> 01:49:28.462 region:rollup2
THEY IMPLEMENT THIS AND I GO

01:49:26.693 --> 01:49:29.863 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE PROCESS OF CREATING

01:49:28.462 --> 01:49:30.764 region:rollup2
THE NEW PROGRAMS TO EVALUATE THE

01:49:29.863 --> 01:49:31.799 region:rollup2
RECORDS.

01:49:30.764 --> 01:49:34.401 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A STAFF THAT IS

01:49:31.799 --> 01:49:35.469 region:rollup2
DEDICATED A TO REVIEWING OF THE

01:49:34.401 --> 01:49:37.371 region:rollup2
APPLICANTS OTHER COME BACK WITH

01:49:35.469 --> 01:49:38.405 region:rollup2
A CRIMINAL RECORD A AND WE THINK

01:49:37.371 --> 01:49:39.940 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE DOING A AN

01:49:38.405 --> 01:49:41.108 region:rollup2
EXCELLENT JOB FOR THAT REASON

01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:41.875 region:rollup2
WERE OPPOSED.

01:49:41.108 --> 01:49:43.243 region:rollup2
THANK YOU DISH AWARENESS IS

01:49:41.875 --> 01:49:44.778 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION.

01:49:43.243 --> 01:49:46.480 region:rollup2
SEEING NOT BRING THAT COMMITTEE

01:49:44.778 --> 01:49:48.415 region:rollup2
MEMBERS ANYONE WISHING TO SPEAK

01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:50.751 region:rollup2
ON THIS ITEM. MS BAKER THANK YOU

01:49:48.415 --> 01:49:51.385 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD

01:49:50.751 --> 01:49:52.386 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL I THINK.

01:49:51.385 --> 01:49:53.987 region:rollup2
.

01:49:52.386 --> 01:49:55.322 region:rollup2
JUSTICE COMMITTEE LAST WEEKEND

01:49:53.987 --> 01:49:57.291 region:rollup2
PART TIME TO REALLY LOOK FOR

01:49:55.322 --> 01:49:58.459 region:rollup2
WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN BE.

01:49:57.291 --> 01:49:59.927 region:rollup2
ENSURING THAT WE'RE NOT SEEING

01:49:58.459 --> 01:50:01.562 region:rollup2
THAT TOO MANY BARRIERS TO CAREER

01:49:59.927 --> 01:50:03.330 region:rollup2
PATHWAYS AND PARTICULARLY THOSE

01:50:01.562 --> 01:50:03.964 region:rollup2
WHO WANT TO BEGIN AGAIN.

01:50:03.330 --> 01:50:06.066 region:rollup2
AND.

01:50:03.964 --> 01:50:07.367 region:rollup2
FOR WHOM WE NEED THE WORKFORCE

01:50:06.066 --> 01:50:07.935 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE'RE SEEING MANY MORE

01:50:07.367 --> 01:50:17.077 region:rollup2
PEOPLE RETIRE AND LEAVE THE

01:50:07.935 --> 01:50:19.012 region:rollup2
WORK.

01:50:17.077 --> 01:50:20.781 region:rollup2
SO HERE'S THE THING THAT WE WE

01:50:19.012 --> 01:50:22.282 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT TO GO TOO FAR TO THE

01:50:20.781 --> 01:50:23.517 region:rollup2
OTHER SIDE SO I HAVE A COUPLE

01:50:22.282 --> 01:50:25.185 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ABOUT PROVISIONS THE

01:50:23.517 --> 01:50:26.153 region:rollup2
BILL HELP ME DECIPHER GOING.

01:50:25.185 --> 01:50:28.622 region:rollup2
WHERE WHERE YOU'RE GOING IF IT'S

01:50:26.153 --> 01:50:30.190 region:rollup2
TOO FAR ONE IS I KNOW THAT IN

01:50:28.622 --> 01:50:31.658 region:rollup2
ORDER FOR THE BOARD MY WENT OVER

01:50:30.190 --> 01:50:33.293 region:rollup2
SIMPLIFIED AND YOU THIS BILL TO

01:50:31.658 --> 01:50:34.695 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO DENY? LICENSE

01:50:33.293 --> 01:50:36.363 region:rollup2
APPLICATION BASED ON A

01:50:34.695 --> 01:50:38.332 region:rollup2
CONVICTION IT NEEDS TO BE A

01:50:36.363 --> 01:50:39.867 region:rollup2
CONVICTION IS TO BE RELATED. TO

01:50:38.332 --> 01:50:41.401 region:rollup2
THE JOB FOR WHICH THEY ARE

01:50:39.867 --> 01:50:42.703 region:rollup2
REQUESTING LICENSE OR ADVERSELY

01:50:41.401 --> 01:50:45.606 region:rollup2
AFFECT THAT.

01:50:42.703 --> 01:50:47.841 region:rollup2
DOES PERJURY FALL INTO THAT.

01:50:45.606 --> 01:50:50.144 region:rollup2
.

01:50:47.841 --> 01:50:52.446 region:rollup2
I WOULD ASSUME THAT IF LINE.

01:50:50.144 --> 01:50:54.481 region:rollup2
IN A IN THE BUSINESS CONTEXT IS

01:50:52.446 --> 01:50:55.749 region:rollup2
RELEVANT TO THE PROFESSION THAT

01:50:54.481 --> 01:50:57.317 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A CLINTON.

01:50:55.749 --> 01:50:58.552 region:rollup2
AND THAT WOULD BE UP TO EACH

01:50:57.317 --> 01:50:59.786 region:rollup2
BOARD TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION

01:50:58.552 --> 01:51:01.555 region:rollup2
IT'S UNDER THE AUTHORITY THE

01:50:59.786 --> 01:51:04.124 region:rollup2
BOARD TO DECIDE WHAT TEMPLE LAWS

01:51:01.555 --> 01:51:06.260 region:rollup2
WOULD BE PERMITTED EN MI READ OF

01:51:04.124 --> 01:51:07.995 region:rollup2
IT WAS THAT PERJURY. IT'S IT'S

01:51:06.260 --> 01:51:09.496 region:rollup2
QUESTIONABLE EXPERTS QUESTION

01:51:07.995 --> 01:51:11.398 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD THINK THAT PERJURY

01:51:09.496 --> 01:51:12.332 region:rollup2
IS ONE THAT ABSOLUTELY SHOULD BE

01:51:11.398 --> 01:51:14.201 region:rollup2
IT SHOULD BE EXPLICIT THAT THE

01:51:12.332 --> 01:51:16.403 region:rollup2
BOARD. CAN MAKE THAT

01:51:14.201 --> 01:51:17.738 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION AND THAT'S WET

01:51:16.403 --> 01:51:19.439 region:rollup2
POPPED OUT IN MY MIND RIGHT AWAY

01:51:17.738 --> 01:51:20.040 region:rollup2
AND IF IF YOU'RE CONTINUING TO

01:51:19.439 --> 01:51:20.340 region:rollup2
WORK ON THE BILL THAT WOULD BE

01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:21.875 region:rollup2
ONE THING.

01:51:20.340 --> 01:51:23.177 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY LOOK AT.

01:51:21.875 --> 01:51:24.978 region:rollup2
AND THE OTHER IS

01:51:23.177 --> 01:51:27.581 region:rollup2
VIOLENT FELONY.

01:51:24.978 --> 01:51:28.515 region:rollup2
I KNOW YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU

01:51:27.581 --> 01:51:30.517 region:rollup2
HAVE ADOPTING SOME OF THE

01:51:28.515 --> 01:51:31.952 region:rollup2
STATUTES.

01:51:30.517 --> 01:51:33.020 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA ALREADY YOU'RE NOT

01:51:31.952 --> 01:51:34.788 region:rollup2
REWRITING THE LIST YOU'RE

01:51:33.020 --> 01:51:36.590 region:rollup2
ADOPTING OTHER PROVISIONS.

01:51:34.788 --> 01:51:37.758 region:rollup2
TWENTY THREE OR TWENTY FIVE

01:51:36.590 --> 01:51:39.126 region:rollup2
DEFINITIONS OF VIOLENT FELONY

01:51:37.758 --> 01:51:40.194 region:rollup2
WHICH I REPEATEDLY HAVE A

01:51:39.126 --> 01:51:41.695 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WITH BECAUSE IT LEAVES

01:51:40.194 --> 01:51:43.797 region:rollup2
OUT.

01:51:41.695 --> 01:51:46.066 region:rollup2
SOME. CRIMES THAT ARE NOT

01:51:43.797 --> 01:51:46.934 region:rollup2
FELONIES ARE MISDEMEANORS

01:51:46.066 --> 01:51:48.402 region:rollup2
INCLUDING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:51:46.934 --> 01:51:50.204 region:rollup2
VIOLATING A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:51:48.402 --> 01:51:51.338 region:rollup2
RESTRAINING ORDER. AND IF WE'RE

01:51:50.204 --> 01:51:54.007 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT SOME TO BE LICENSED

01:51:51.338 --> 01:51:55.475 region:rollup2
IN AN AREA WHERE. YOU YOU ARE

01:51:54.007 --> 01:51:56.577 region:rollup2
REPEATEDLY VIOLATING A DOMESTIC

01:51:55.475 --> 01:51:57.844 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER I

01:51:56.577 --> 01:51:58.478 region:rollup2
THINK THAT SHE

01:51:57.844 --> 01:51:59.580 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THE BOARD SHOULD BE

01:51:58.478 --> 01:52:01.315 region:rollup2
ABLE TO CONSIDERING EVEN HAVE AS

01:51:59.580 --> 01:52:02.883 region:rollup2
A BASIS FOR.

01:52:01.315 --> 01:52:04.351 region:rollup2
FOR SAYING NO YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT

01:52:02.883 --> 01:52:04.985 region:rollup2
THERE YET YOU NOT APPROPRIATE

01:52:04.351 --> 01:52:07.421 region:rollup2
FOR THIS LICENSE BUT.

01:52:04.985 --> 01:52:08.922 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT CONSIDERED VIOLENT

01:52:07.421 --> 01:52:09.189 region:rollup2
FELONIES UNDER OUR LAWS

01:52:08.922 --> 01:52:10.757 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES.

01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:11.925 region:rollup2
.

01:52:10.757 --> 01:52:13.794 region:rollup2
THREATS OF ASSAULT TO A PEACE

01:52:11.925 --> 01:52:15.195 region:rollup2
OFFICER ALSO ARE NOT CONSIDERED

01:52:13.794 --> 01:52:16.964 region:rollup2
VIOLENT FELONIES.

01:52:15.195 --> 01:52:18.398 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT WAS CAN OFTEN BE TOO

01:52:16.964 --> 01:52:19.433 region:rollup2
NARROW A LIST I HAVE FOUND IN

01:52:18.398 --> 01:52:21.101 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA I THINK IT'S TOO

01:52:19.433 --> 01:52:22.469 region:rollup2
NARROW WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT.

01:52:21.101 --> 01:52:24.271 region:rollup2
MANY OF OUR LAWS ARE SAYING WE

01:52:22.469 --> 01:52:25.572 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT THIS TO BE THE BASIS

01:52:24.271 --> 01:52:27.274 region:rollup2
IT SOUNDS VERY GOOD AND I'M I'M

01:52:25.572 --> 01:52:27.908 region:rollup2
SURE THAT'S HOW YOU DOING THIS

01:52:27.274 --> 01:52:28.909 region:rollup2
BUT IT OFTEN SOUNDS GET FOLKS TO

01:52:27.908 --> 01:52:29.977 region:rollup2
SAY.

01:52:28.909 --> 01:52:32.045 region:rollup2
I WE'RE MAKING SURE THE VIOLENT

01:52:29.977 --> 01:52:33.113 region:rollup2
FELONIES ARE PROTECTED.

01:52:32.045 --> 01:52:34.615 region:rollup2
THAT'S OFTEN A WEAKNESS IN THE

01:52:33.113 --> 01:52:36.483 region:rollup2
SECOND ONE IS IS IS IT A FELONY

01:52:34.615 --> 01:52:38.051 region:rollup2
FROM SOMEONE ELSE'S STATE.

01:52:36.483 --> 01:52:39.353 region:rollup2
SO LET'S SAY SOMEBODY COMES TO

01:52:38.051 --> 01:52:40.754 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA APPLIES FOR A LICENSE

01:52:39.353 --> 01:52:42.789 region:rollup2
AND SOMETHING IS A VIOLENT

01:52:40.754 --> 01:52:44.791 region:rollup2
FELONY IN ANOTHER STATE BUT

01:52:42.789 --> 01:52:45.859 region:rollup2
ISN'T A VIOLENT FELONY HERE. AND

01:52:44.791 --> 01:52:48.028 region:rollup2
I'D I WOULD LOOK VERY CAREFULLY

01:52:45.859 --> 01:52:49.796 region:rollup2
AT THAT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE

01:52:48.028 --> 01:52:52.266 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE TIME THE.

01:52:49.796 --> 01:52:53.266 region:rollup2
HANDS OF THE LICENSE BOARDS TO

01:52:52.266 --> 01:52:55.502 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE

01:52:53.266 --> 01:52:57.738 region:rollup2
DETERMINATIONS AND.

01:52:55.502 --> 01:52:58.338 region:rollup2
IT MAY I I MAY NOT HAVE READ IT

01:52:57.738 --> 01:52:59.406 region:rollup2
CAREFULLY BUT I DIDN'T POP OUT

01:52:58.338 --> 01:53:01.041 region:rollup2
TO ME.

01:52:59.406 --> 01:53:03.343 region:rollup2
AND THEN WHY FIVE YEARS FIVE

01:53:01.041 --> 01:53:05.946 region:rollup2
YEARS SEEMS PARTICULARLY.

01:53:03.343 --> 01:53:07.347 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:53:05.946 --> 01:53:09.883 region:rollup2
A SHORT TIME PERIOD YOU KNOW

01:53:07.347 --> 01:53:12.552 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ADULTS HAVE A A LIFE OF.

01:53:09.883 --> 01:53:14.154 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR THAT WE CARRY WITH US.

01:53:12.552 --> 01:53:15.689 region:rollup2
WHAT BROUGHT YOU TO THE

01:53:14.154 --> 01:53:16.890 region:rollup2
CONCLUSION OF FIVE YEARS BEING

01:53:15.689 --> 01:53:18.125 region:rollup2
THE CUT OFF BECAUSE FOR ME

01:53:16.890 --> 01:53:19.660 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE DEBATE ON THE NARROW

01:53:18.125 --> 01:53:21.361 region:rollup2
SIDE PARTICULAR BECAUSE?

01:53:19.660 --> 01:53:23.297 region:rollup2
WITH SOME OF THE PRESSURE

01:53:21.361 --> 01:53:26.166 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS TAKES UP TO THREE YEARS

01:53:23.297 --> 01:53:26.166 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THE OTHER TRAINING

01:53:26.233 --> 01:53:29.803 region:rollup2
AND SO SOMEONE TO BE IN A TRADE

01:53:28.001 --> 01:53:32.205 region:rollup2
FOR FIVE YEARS FAIRLY NEW TO IT

01:53:29.803 --> 01:53:33.707 region:rollup2
AND THEIR CONVICTION IS.

01:53:32.205 --> 01:53:35.309 region:rollup2
SO WE WERE TRIED STRUCK A

01:53:33.707 --> 01:53:36.743 region:rollup2
BALANCE IN THIS BILL.

01:53:35.309 --> 01:53:39.479 region:rollup2
ON THE ONE HAND.

01:53:36.743 --> 01:53:41.014 region:rollup2
WE THOUGHT THAT ALLOWS THEM TO

01:53:39.479 --> 01:53:42.349 region:rollup2
APPLY FOR A LICENSE RIGHT AFTER

01:53:41.014 --> 01:53:42.983 region:rollup2
CONVICTION THAT DOESN'T MAKE

01:53:42.349 --> 01:53:44.985 region:rollup2
SENSE RIGHT THAT WOULD BE THE

01:53:42.983 --> 01:53:46.820 region:rollup2
ZERO MARK. ON THE OTHER HAND.

01:53:44.985 --> 01:53:48.155 region:rollup2
THE LONGER WE WAIT WERE TALKING

01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:49.690 region:rollup2
AGAIN ABOUT EIGHT MILLION

01:53:48.155 --> 01:53:51.658 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS ONE OUT OF THREE

01:53:49.690 --> 01:53:53.193 region:rollup2
ADULTS WHO ARE EXCLUDED FROM

01:53:51.658 --> 01:53:54.695 region:rollup2
ALMOST THIRTY PERCENT OF

01:53:53.193 --> 01:53:56.296 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA JOBS THAT'S.

01:53:54.695 --> 01:53:57.230 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE WERE TRYING TO ADDRESS

01:53:56.296 --> 01:53:58.031 region:rollup2
FIVE YEARS FELT LIKE THE RIGHT

01:53:57.230 --> 01:53:59.499 region:rollup2
BALANCE TO US.

01:53:58.031 --> 01:54:01.401 region:rollup2
I KNOW UNDER.

01:53:59.499 --> 01:54:03.036 region:rollup2
UNDER SOME STANDARDS.

01:54:01.401 --> 01:54:05.238 region:rollup2
DOJ.

01:54:03.036 --> 01:54:06.006 region:rollup2
BACKGROUND CHECKS AND OTHERS

01:54:05.238 --> 01:54:07.607 region:rollup2
IT'S MORE OF A SEVEN YEAR

01:54:06.006 --> 01:54:08.909 region:rollup2
STANDARD I'M OPEN TO

01:54:07.607 --> 01:54:10.243 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION THE COMEDIAN ALSO

01:54:08.909 --> 01:54:11.845 region:rollup2
SUGGEST THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING

01:54:10.243 --> 01:54:13.680 region:rollup2
FOR US TO DISCUSS BUT. BUT I

01:54:11.845 --> 01:54:14.981 region:rollup2
THINK FIVE YEARS FEELS LIKE THE

01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:17.718 region:rollup2
RIGHT BALANCE AFTER SOMEONE'S

01:54:14.981 --> 01:54:19.920 region:rollup2
BEEN CONVICTED TO. OF HAVE PAID

01:54:17.718 --> 01:54:21.355 region:rollup2
THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY AYE AND

01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:22.155 region:rollup2
DURING THAT TIME PERIOD IF THEY

01:54:21.355 --> 01:54:23.824 region:rollup2
HAVE IT RE OFFENDED.

01:54:22.155 --> 01:54:25.158 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S NOT A SUBSEQUENT

01:54:23.824 --> 01:54:27.227 region:rollup2
CONVICTION I THINK THAT THOSE

01:54:25.158 --> 01:54:28.695 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS OUGHT TO TO HAVE A

01:54:27.227 --> 01:54:30.130 region:rollup2
CHANCE AND SO IT IT IT IS A

01:54:28.695 --> 01:54:31.665 region:rollup2
ADMITTEDLY BALLOTS BUT.

01:54:30.130 --> 01:54:34.000 region:rollup2
IS ONE THAT SEEM TEMP TO MAKE

01:54:31.665 --> 01:54:36.236 region:rollup2
SENSE IF THE GOAL OF OUR SYSTEM

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:37.738 region:rollup2
IS TO TRY TO PREVENT INDIVIDUALS

01:54:36.236 --> 01:54:39.206 region:rollup2
FROM RE OFFENDING. WHAT WE'RE

01:54:37.738 --> 01:54:40.941 region:rollup2
SAYING IS LET'S GIVE THEM A

01:54:39.206 --> 01:54:42.843 region:rollup2
JOBLESS GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY

01:54:40.941 --> 01:54:44.244 region:rollup2
TO GET A LICENSE TO HAVE A JOB

01:54:42.843 --> 01:54:44.911 region:rollup2
YOU WANNA TAKE A MOMENT AND AND?

01:54:44.244 --> 01:54:46.313 region:rollup2
AND.

01:54:44.911 --> 01:54:48.482 region:rollup2
ADDRESS YOUR ISSUE AROUND THE

01:54:46.313 --> 01:54:50.717 region:rollup2
DEFINITION OF OF VIOLENT CRIMES

01:54:48.482 --> 01:54:52.853 region:rollup2
YES WE DIDN'T WANT THIS BILL TO

01:54:50.717 --> 01:54:54.387 region:rollup2
BE THE SUBJECT OF A DEBATE ON

01:54:52.853 --> 01:54:56.656 region:rollup2
WHAT IS IN THAT CATEGORY AND NOT

01:54:54.387 --> 01:54:58.725 region:rollup2
SO. THIS BILL SIMPLY REFERENCES

01:54:56.656 --> 01:54:59.559 region:rollup2
THE DEFINITION OF WHAT UNDER THE

01:54:58.725 --> 01:55:01.461 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE IS

01:54:59.559 --> 01:55:02.996 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED A A VIOLENT CRIME.

01:55:01.461 --> 01:55:04.197 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THERE'S SOME

01:55:02.996 --> 01:55:05.665 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT SHOULD OR

01:55:04.197 --> 01:55:07.667 region:rollup2
SHOULD NOT BE IN THAT CATEGORY.

01:55:05.665 --> 01:55:08.702 region:rollup2
BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THAT MADE

01:55:07.667 --> 01:55:09.970 region:rollup2
SENSE WE WE DON'T WANT TO RE

01:55:08.702 --> 01:55:11.638 region:rollup2
LITIGATE THAT ISSUE HERE AND I

01:55:09.970 --> 01:55:13.340 region:rollup2
THINK I AM BECAUSE IT'S VIOLENT

01:55:11.638 --> 01:55:15.008 region:rollup2
FELONY. THERE ARE BUILT THEIR

01:55:13.340 --> 01:55:16.343 region:rollup2
VIOLENT CRIMES AND OTHER VIOLENT

01:55:15.008 --> 01:55:17.844 region:rollup2
JUST FELONIES AND SO THAT WOULD

01:55:16.343 --> 01:55:19.112 region:rollup2
BE ONE AREA THAT I'M AYE WE

01:55:17.844 --> 01:55:20.514 region:rollup2
CONSIDER THEIR MANY AREAS THAT

01:55:19.112 --> 01:55:22.149 region:rollup2
ARE NOW MISDEMEANORS THAT ARE

01:55:20.514 --> 01:55:22.682 region:rollup2
WORTH LOOKING AT. I'M AND

01:55:22.149 --> 01:55:24.351 region:rollup2
FINALLY.

01:55:22.682 --> 01:55:26.186 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR THAT HELPFUL

01:55:24.351 --> 01:55:27.521 region:rollup2
ANSWER THERE'S ONE MORE POINT

01:55:26.186 --> 01:55:29.589 region:rollup2
THAT SEEMS TO BE IT IS IN

01:55:27.521 --> 01:55:30.924 region:rollup2
DISPUTE HAVE WE HEARD FROM

01:55:29.589 --> 01:55:32.626 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION THAT NINETY NINE

01:55:30.924 --> 01:55:34.427 region:rollup2
PERCENT. OF THOSE WHO ARE

01:55:32.626 --> 01:55:34.961 region:rollup2
APPLYING FOR THESE LICENSES ARE

01:55:34.427 --> 01:55:37.497 region:rollup2
GETTING THEM REGARDLESS OF

01:55:34.961 --> 01:55:39.132 region:rollup2
PRIOR.

01:55:37.497 --> 01:55:40.667 region:rollup2
FELONY CRIMINAL BACKGROUND

01:55:39.132 --> 01:55:42.169 region:rollup2
COOPER CONVICTION THAT'S ONE

01:55:40.667 --> 01:55:43.537 region:rollup2
PERCENT THAT'S A FAIRLY NARROW

01:55:42.169 --> 01:55:44.805 region:rollup2
MOUNTAIN THAT THE THE BOARD YOU

01:55:43.537 --> 01:55:46.206 region:rollup2
DOING A GOOD JOB. YOU JUST

01:55:44.805 --> 01:55:47.741 region:rollup2
PRESENTED THE INFORMATION AND I

01:55:46.206 --> 01:55:51.978 region:rollup2
MAY HAVE HEARD AROUND ONE IN

01:55:47.741 --> 01:55:53.146 region:rollup2
THREE OR EIGHT MILLION ARE NOT

01:55:51.978 --> 01:55:53.747 region:rollup2
GETTING.

01:55:53.146 --> 01:55:54.414 region:rollup2
OR MAYBE COULD STATE AGAIN ARE

01:55:53.747 --> 01:55:56.349 region:rollup2
NOT GETTING A LICENSE FOR IT. I

01:55:54.414 --> 01:55:57.484 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW WHERE THE SOURCES ARE

01:55:56.349 --> 01:56:00.287 region:rollup2
ON IT BUT.

01:55:57.484 --> 01:56:01.588 region:rollup2
I'VE HAD CONTRACTORS EMPLOYERS

01:56:00.287 --> 01:56:03.457 region:rollup2
IN MY BUSINESS IN HER MY

01:56:01.588 --> 01:56:05.725 region:rollup2
DISTRICT COME TO ME AND SAY WE

01:56:03.457 --> 01:56:07.093 region:rollup2
WE ARE. AGGRESSIVELY LOOKING FOR

01:56:05.725 --> 01:56:09.329 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE REBUILDING THEIR

01:56:07.093 --> 01:56:10.831 region:rollup2
LIVES BECAUSE WE NEED THE WORK

01:56:09.329 --> 01:56:12.599 region:rollup2
FORCE AND I'M NOT SEEN.

01:56:10.831 --> 01:56:14.167 region:rollup2
THE DENIALS AS MUCH IF YOU CAN

01:56:12.599 --> 01:56:15.802 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THOSE STUDENTS TO

01:56:14.167 --> 01:56:17.137 region:rollup2
STATISTICS THAT SEEM TO BE

01:56:15.802 --> 01:56:18.972 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY CONTRARY.

01:56:17.137 --> 01:56:19.739 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT HELPS US GET A SENSE

01:56:18.972 --> 01:56:21.308 region:rollup2
OF HOW MUCH IS THERE REALLY A

01:56:19.739 --> 01:56:22.776 region:rollup2
PROBLEM SO LET ME LET ME BE

01:56:21.308 --> 01:56:24.611 region:rollup2
CLEAR ABOUT THE STATISTICS THAT

01:56:22.776 --> 01:56:26.580 region:rollup2
I REFERENCED SO WHERE ST ALMOST

01:56:24.611 --> 01:56:28.114 region:rollup2
EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS.

01:56:26.580 --> 01:56:29.816 region:rollup2
EITHER BEEN ARRESTED OR

01:56:28.114 --> 01:56:31.451 region:rollup2
CONVICTED SO THAT'S THE

01:56:29.816 --> 01:56:32.886 region:rollup2
POPULATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:56:31.451 --> 01:56:34.421 region:rollup2
AND THEN THERE ARE THIRTY

01:56:32.886 --> 01:56:36.489 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF ALL CALIFORNIA JOBS

01:56:34.421 --> 01:56:38.258 region:rollup2
REQUIRE A LICENSE OR CERTIFICATE

01:56:36.489 --> 01:56:40.393 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S THE UNIVERSE OF FOLKS

01:56:38.258 --> 01:56:42.162 region:rollup2
THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE DENIED

01:56:40.393 --> 01:56:42.729 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO LICENSE NOW WE DON'T

01:56:42.162 --> 01:56:44.397 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL NUMBERS

01:56:42.729 --> 01:56:46.566 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:56:44.397 --> 01:56:48.368 region:rollup2
IN PART BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

01:56:46.566 --> 01:56:49.870 region:rollup2
THIS DATA AND ONE ASPECT OF THIS

01:56:48.368 --> 01:56:51.171 region:rollup2
BILL WOULD ACTUALLY COLLECT THE

01:56:49.870 --> 01:56:53.139 region:rollup2
STATUS OF THAT WE KNOW WHAT THE

01:56:51.171 --> 01:56:55.008 region:rollup2
RIGHT ANSWER IS. BUT I CAN TELL

01:56:53.139 --> 01:56:55.709 region:rollup2
YOU AND ASSURE YOU THAT THE MANY

01:56:55.008 --> 01:56:56.843 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE

01:56:55.709 --> 01:56:57.811 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING THIS ARE SUPPORTING

01:56:56.843 --> 01:56:59.179 region:rollup2
THIS BECAUSE.

01:56:57.811 --> 01:57:00.280 region:rollup2
THEY ARE CONNECTED WITH

01:56:59.179 --> 01:57:02.215 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF

01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:03.984 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE UNABLE TO

01:57:02.215 --> 01:57:05.952 region:rollup2
TO ACCESS THESE OCCUPATIONS

01:57:03.984 --> 01:57:06.553 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THIS LICENSE ONE

01:57:05.952 --> 01:57:07.554 region:rollup2
FINAL THING I'LL JUST MENTION

01:57:06.553 --> 01:57:08.521 region:rollup2
IS.

01:57:07.554 --> 01:57:09.856 region:rollup2
UNDER THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT

01:57:08.521 --> 01:57:11.625 region:rollup2
OF CORRECTIONS IF YOU VISIT

01:57:09.856 --> 01:57:13.393 region:rollup2
THEIR WEBSITE IT LIST TWENTY

01:57:11.625 --> 01:57:15.295 region:rollup2
CAREER OR TECHNICAL EDUCATION

01:57:13.393 --> 01:57:16.930 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS PROVIDED TO PRISONERS

01:57:15.295 --> 01:57:18.365 region:rollup2
FOLKS IN OUR SYSTEM. BUT

01:57:16.930 --> 01:57:20.500 region:rollup2
IRONICALLY MOST OF THESE VERY

01:57:18.365 --> 01:57:22.269 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS ONCE YOU GET OUT OF

01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:24.037 region:rollup2
PRISON YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY APPLY

01:57:22.269 --> 01:57:25.405 region:rollup2
FOR. A LICENSE IN THAT

01:57:24.037 --> 01:57:27.107 region:rollup2
PROFESSION

01:57:25.405 --> 01:57:28.575 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE IN COSMETOLOGY AUTO

01:57:27.107 --> 01:57:29.776 region:rollup2
REPAIR EXCEPT TRUCK

01:57:28.575 --> 01:57:31.278 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE VERY SITUATION

01:57:29.776 --> 01:57:32.612 region:rollup2
WE'RE HAVING RIGHT NOW SO WE'VE

01:57:31.278 --> 01:57:34.114 region:rollup2
WE SET UP OUR CORRECTIONAL

01:57:32.612 --> 01:57:35.315 region:rollup2
SYSTEM HOPEFULLY TRAIN FOLKS.

01:57:34.114 --> 01:57:37.717 region:rollup2
TO GET THESE JOBS AND THEN THEY

01:57:35.315 --> 01:57:39.686 region:rollup2
COME OUT AND THEY CAN'T SO HE

01:57:37.717 --> 01:57:40.320 region:rollup2
CAN'T APPLY FOR THEM AT ALL.

01:57:39.686 --> 01:57:41.521 region:rollup2
ARE THEY ARE THEY MAY NOT GET A

01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:43.290 region:rollup2
LICENSE

01:57:41.521 --> 01:57:45.292 region:rollup2
THEY MAY NOT GET A LICENSE OP

01:57:43.290 --> 01:57:46.226 region:rollup2
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE DEFINITION

01:57:45.292 --> 01:57:47.661 region:rollup2
OF WHAT THE SPORTS CAN LOOK AT

01:57:46.226 --> 01:57:48.962 region:rollup2
IS VERY BROAD.

01:57:47.661 --> 01:57:50.230 region:rollup2
SO THE REALLY NO STANDARDS AND

01:57:48.962 --> 01:57:52.399 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE SAYING HERE IS FOR

01:57:50.230 --> 01:57:54.200 region:rollup2
THAT CATEGORY OF NON VIOLENT

01:57:52.399 --> 01:57:55.835 region:rollup2
OFFENDERS WHOSE CONVICTION IS

01:57:54.200 --> 01:57:57.504 region:rollup2
LONGER THAN FIVE YEARS. WE WANT

01:57:55.835 --> 01:57:59.339 region:rollup2
TO GIVE THEM A SHOT AND WE THINK

01:57:57.504 --> 01:58:00.941 region:rollup2
THAT THAT CATEGORY OUGHT TO

01:57:59.339 --> 01:58:04.044 region:rollup2
OUGHT NOT BE LOOKED AT.

01:58:00.941 --> 01:58:04.511 region:rollup2
AGAIN UNLESS THE CRIME FITS.

01:58:04.044 --> 01:58:05.779 region:rollup2
AND IS RELATED TO THE

01:58:04.511 --> 01:58:07.080 region:rollup2
PROFESSION

01:58:05.779 --> 01:58:08.848 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU VERY MUCH AND THAT'S

01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:10.383 region:rollup2
HELPFUL I I THINK YOU HAVE A LOT

01:58:08.848 --> 01:58:10.984 region:rollup2
OF TERRIFIC PROVISIONS IN THIS

01:58:10.383 --> 01:58:14.020 region:rollup2
BILL PARTICULAR THE NEED FOR

01:58:10.984 --> 01:58:16.289 region:rollup2
DATA. WHICH I THINK THIS.

01:58:14.020 --> 01:58:18.258 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION UNDERSCORES AS WELL

01:58:16.289 --> 01:58:19.793 region:rollup2
AS THE PRECISION ABOUT WHAT DATA

01:58:18.258 --> 01:58:21.661 region:rollup2
WE HAVE IF IT'S THAT PEOPLE ARE

01:58:19.793 --> 01:58:22.963 region:rollup2
BEING. DENIED AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:58:21.661 --> 01:58:24.297 region:rollup2
APPLY FOR A LICENSE WHICH YOU

01:58:22.963 --> 01:58:25.565 region:rollup2
JUST MENTIONED ARE NOT IT'S JUST

01:58:24.297 --> 01:58:27.133 region:rollup2
WHAT IS REALLY CAUSING THE

01:58:25.565 --> 01:58:27.734 region:rollup2
DENIAL SO THAT WE CAN BE A

01:58:27.133 --> 01:58:28.668 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT MORE PRECISE ABOUT

01:58:27.734 --> 01:58:30.170 region:rollup2
IT.

01:58:28.668 --> 01:58:32.472 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR BECAUSE THESE BOARDS

01:58:30.170 --> 01:58:33.006 region:rollup2
ARE FOR CONSUMER SAFETY FOR ARE

01:58:32.472 --> 01:58:35.175 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED TO BE FIRST AND

01:58:33.006 --> 01:58:37.110 region:rollup2
FOREMOST NOT. RESTRICTING PEOPLE

01:58:35.175 --> 01:58:38.945 region:rollup2
FROM COMING INTO THE FIELD I I I

01:58:37.110 --> 01:58:40.080 region:rollup2
CAN'T GET THERE TODAY ON IT HERE

01:58:38.945 --> 01:58:41.881 region:rollup2
BUT I HOPE I'VE GIVEN SOME

01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:43.416 region:rollup2
SPECIFICS THAT ARE WHERE

01:58:41.881 --> 01:58:44.951 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY WOULD BE HELPFUL IS IF

01:58:43.416 --> 01:58:47.153 region:rollup2
THE BILL CONTINUES TO MOVE.

01:58:44.951 --> 01:58:48.254 region:rollup2
AND AND THAT WE CAN BE LOOKING

01:58:47.153 --> 01:58:49.122 region:rollup2
FOR SOME OF THOSE AREAS THAT WE

01:58:48.254 --> 01:58:50.590 region:rollup2
ALL AGREE ON THERE'S A LOT OF

01:58:49.122 --> 01:58:52.525 region:rollup2
CONSENSUS.

01:58:50.590 --> 01:58:54.661 region:rollup2
AND START THERE AND SEE IF IT'S

01:58:52.525 --> 01:58:56.296 region:rollup2
REALLY NECESSARY TO GO AS BROAD

01:58:54.661 --> 01:58:57.564 region:rollup2
AS I FEEL THE BILL GOES TODAY.

01:58:56.296 --> 01:58:58.798 region:rollup2
AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR

01:58:57.564 --> 01:59:00.600 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION.

01:58:58.798 --> 01:59:02.068 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER GIPSON.

ARMS CERTAINLY I WANT TO SAY

01:59:03.970 --> 01:59:06.306 region:rollup2
THAT OF THIS IS EXCITING BILL TO

01:59:05.939 --> 01:59:07.641 region:rollup2
ME.

01:59:06.306 --> 01:59:09.776 region:rollup2
I REMEMBER WHEN.

01:59:07.641 --> 01:59:12.245 region:rollup2
FORMER SPEAKER EMERITUS KAREN
