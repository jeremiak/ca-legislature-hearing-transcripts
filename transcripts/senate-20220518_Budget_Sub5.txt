THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MISTER WELLS. OF WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO THE L. A. MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBER THANK YOU WITH THE LEAD AND OFFICE I MADE A PROVIDER OFFICES- MY HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS- ON OUR INITIAL COMMENTS ON THE MAY REVISION PROPOSAL RELATED TO TRANSPORTATION- OVERALL THE MAY REVISION DOES NOT INCLUDE MANY NEW TRANSPORTATION PROPOSALS- THE GOVERNOR MAINTAINED SIGNIFICANT GENERAL FUND SPENDING AND TRANSPORTATION THAT WAS PROPOSED BACK IN JANUARY. MANY THROUGH THE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE AND THE SUPPLY CHAIN PACKAGE- THE FEW NEW PROPOSALS IN THE MAY REVISION INCLUDE FINDING A POLICY CHANGES TO IMPLEMENT THE NEW FEDERAL FUNDS UNDER I. AJ IN THE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE AND THE RELIEF- REVISION INCLUDE SOMETHING. STAFF AND COULD A TOWARD AND FUND FOR AROUND A THOUSAND NEW POSITIONS THAT CALTRANS. WHICH WOULD BE DEDICATED TO ADMINISTERING IMPLEMENTING I. AJ AND THE PROBLEM AND THAT A MILE NETWORK PROGRAM. WELL THESE ARE LARGE AND INCREASES THE WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEW FEDERAL FUNDING AND THE BROADBAND. NETWORK PROGRAM WILL BE SIGNIFICANT AND LAST FOR SEVERAL YEARS- THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES SEVERAL POLICY CHANGES THROUGH BUDGET TRAILER LEGISLATION RELATED TIE AJ FUNDING. AND A TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE- FOR INSTANCE THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO PROVIDE CALTRANS WITH THE AUTHORITY TO UTILIZE DESIGN BUILD PROCUREMENT THROUGH TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. CURRENTLY THE APARTMENT HAS- VERY LIMITED AUTHORITY TO USE THIS PROJECT TO LIBERATE METHANE. GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE CHANGES THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER IT IS PREPARED TO TAKE ACTION ON THESE PROPOSALS NOW. OR WHETHER IT MIGHT MAKE MORE SENSE TO DEFER ACTION ON THESE ITEMS UNTIL LATER IN THE SUMMER OR NEXT YEAR TO ALLOW FOR TO SIT THAT DECISIONAL DISCUSSION. THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO CHOOSE TO DEBATE THESE CHANGES TO THE POLICY PROCESS RATHER. THAN THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS- THE MAY REVISION ALSO INCLUDES EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION- TO DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES FOR WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED BUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE TAX REFUNDS TO VEHICLE OWNERS. ON THE NEED FOR THIS FUNDING WILL BE BASED ON WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE APPROVES THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL OR SOMETHING SIMILAR- BESIDES STOPPING IN TRAILER BILL- BEING PROPOSED THE ONE BIG NEW TRANSPORTATION FUNDING PROPOSAL NÚMERO VISION IS AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM- THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION INCLUDED IN THE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE BACK IN JANUARY- THIS PROGRAM IS THAT SIGNIFICANT DEMAND EXCEEDING AVAILABLE FUNDING IN RECENT YEARS. ALSO BACK IN APRIL AS PART OF THIS RELIEF PACKAGE THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS INCENTIVE GRANTS TO TRANSIT AND RAIL AGENCIES TO PROVIDE FREE TRANSIT SERVICES FOR THREE MONTHS. WE SUGGEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE THINK ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL AS PART OF ITS OVERALL PRIORITIES FOR PROVIDING RELIEF. RATHER THAN A STANDALONE TRANSPORTATION PROPOSAL. AND THEN FINALLY AS MY COLLEAGUE MISTER SORT OF WORD MENTIONED- SAU WILL BE- SAU THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS AND IT WILL BE SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ON THE MIND OF THE LEGISLATURE. SUSSING OUT OF THE TRANSFER PROPOSALS LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO CONSIDER THEM IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SOUTH- SPENDING RELATED TO TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE IS EXCLUDED UNDER THE STYLE- SO WILL BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT GIVEN THE STATE'S CURRENT BUT- DISTRICTS- AND WITH THAT HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. FOR OKAY THANK YOU MR- HUMANNESS. OUR TURN OVER TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. FOR THOSE FOR THEM OKAY I GREW UP WITH THREE. OKAY I- I DO HAVE A FEW- HERE IN THIS IN THIS. THE THE FREE NOT TRANSIT PROPOSAL. NOT SURE WHO WILL ANSWER THE QUESTIONS ON THAT- BUT THE FREE TRANSIT- PROPOSAL- COULD YOU DESCRIBE THAT- A LITTLE BIT MORE% THREE TRANSIT ACCESS AND THEN YET THE NEED FOR SAFETY AND SECURITY. MANY WRITERS DO YOU ANTICIPATE A WILL BENEFIT- WHERE IT'S LIKE WHERE IS IT LIKE LIKELY TO HAVE THE HIGHEST USE. PUTIN MINISTRATION. SOME OF THAT INFORMATION I'M I'M SORRY TO SEE WHAT'S GOING FORWARD FINANCED- I'M OT SURE IF WE HAVE- ANYONE ON THE LINE FROM- FROM- TRANSPORTATION AGENCY THAT WOULD HAVE THAT INFORMATION- AVAILABLE I THINK THE CONCEPT BEHIND THE PROPOSAL IS THAT- YOU KNOW- YOUR BOXES WAY DOWN NOW- YEAH DO A LOT OF FACTORS. AND YOU KNOW TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SORT OF IN THE LAST YEAR PRIOR TO THE- PANDEMIC THAT AND SINCE ALL OF FAREBOX REVENUES REPORTED WE'RE ABLE TO LOOK AT FAREBOX REVENUE AND SEE WHERE IT WAS. AND BE ABLE TO CALL THE PROPOSAL THAT PROVIDES A BIT MORE FUNDING THAN THEY WOULD RECEIVE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. AND AND WE WANT THE PART WE WANT THE DIFFERENT TRANSIT AGENCIES TO BE CREATIVE AND TO COME UP WITH WAYS ANYA THEY ALREADY THERE'S ALREADY MANY PROGRAMS THAT THEY DO FOR. A DIFFERENT YOU KNOW FREE WEEKENDS OR FREEDOM TO- YOU KNOW ABOUT STUDENTS THAT SORT OF THING I THINK WE WANT TO EXPAND ON THAT WE WANT TO TRY TO MAKE THAT- YOU KNOW LARGER AND- I THINK TO SOME DEGREE AT LEAST ON THE FINANCE SIDE WE'RE VERY WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING- YOU KNOW WHAT THAT DOES YOU KNOW WHAT. WHAT ARE THE RESULTS OF THAT I MEAN YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT SORT OF BANG FOR THE BUCK I THINK IT COULD BE PROVIDED SOME REAL IMPORTANT DATA- REGARDING YOU KNOW WHERE RIDERSHIP. IS POSTED BY PRICE CONCERN- ENACTED HELP THEM GAIN FUTURE- WHAT'S THE AYE I THINK I'M NOT SURE IF WE HAVE ANYONE ON THE LINE WHICH WERE KIND OF STRICKEN OF FRAGMENTED THE LITTLE THE SURVEY BUT I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE ANYBODY FROM THE FARM. OKAY LIKE YOU SAID I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE. ADDRESSING AN ISSUE AND HOW ARE WE ADDRESSING THAT- WHO ARE WE LOOKING TO GIVE RELIEF TO ARM AND IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WILL BE HELPFUL TO THE TO THE TRANSIT SYSTEM AND THE IMPACT IT WILL HAVE. ON SAFETY AND SECURITY- THE NUMBER OF REQUESTED POSITIONS HERE IS. OBVIOUSLY QUITE HIGH FOR- I THINK GOOD REASONS BUT HOW DO YOU INTEND- TO THE HIGHER THE NUMBER POSITIONS REQUESTED. IN A TIME FRAME THAT MAKES SENSE THAT'S THAT'S REASONABLE TO FILL THESE NEEDS. I WE'VE HAD CONVERSATION HERE IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND WAS- KELLY CHART AND THERE REALLY WASN'T- FULFILLING THE NEEDS AND THE VACANCIES WITH MUCH SMALLER NUMBERS. EACH. HELLO HELLO OKAY AGAIN I GUESS I'LL- I DON'T KNOW SUPPOSE WE MAY NOT HAVE SOMEONE ON THE LINE FOR CALTRANS GAS THAT I CAN GIVE YOU THE BEST- HE IS SO CALTRANS HAS EXPERIENCED AND WE PASSED SB ONE- BIG SYRIANS- THE FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT IN THE OVERALL BUDGETING- THAT THEY HAD AVAILABLE FOR PROJECTS. AND THEY REALLY HONE THEIR ABILITY TO BRING ON ADDITIONAL ENGINEERS AND- BRING ON ADDITIONAL SCHOOL SUPPORT STAFF- TO MANAGE THAT WORKLOAD SO- THEY'RE PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT THEY CAN HIT THE GROUND RUNNING AND- YOU KNOW REPEAT SOME OF THE SUCCESS THEY WERE VERY SUCCESSFUL IN BRINGING IN I THINK THEY BROUGHT IN EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THE IN THE FIRST FULL YEAR AFTER- AFTER THE- THE- BEST YOU ONE WAS PASSED. SO THIS REQUEST. FOR SOMEWHERE OVER SIX HUNDRED- THIS SEEMS DOABLE BASED ON THEIR PREVIOUS- THEY'RE PRETTY THE PREVIOUS SUCCESS AND- YOU KNOW SO THAT SO THAT'S BUT I THINK IS WHERE IS WHERE WE FEEL LIKE. THIS IS A YOU KNOW THEY HAVE A HISTORY OF BEING ABLE TO DO THIS SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE SEE THAT DENTIST AND IJA YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT'S FIVE YEARS OF MONEY I THINK WE'RE REALLY TREATING IT AS A NEW. ELEVATED LEVEL I MEAN NOT THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. AN ELEVATED LEVEL OF THE PROJECT- SO PROJECTS SUPPORT FOR MULTIPLE YEARS SINCE MOST PROJECTS AVERAGE PROJECT IS ABOUT FOUR YEARS SO WITH FIVE YEARS OF FUNDING YOU KNOW WE MAY BE DOING ADDITIONAL PROJECTS SUPPORT IT WITH NO OTHER CHANGES THAT WOULD BE NINE YEARS- AT THIS HIGHER LEVELS SO- SO THAT'S WHERE I THINK WE CAN. WILL BE ABLE TO INCORPORATE. OKAY. THREE OH ON CALTRANS AGAIN- ON THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL RIGHT OF WAY POSITIONS TO ASSIST HIGH SPEED RAIL AW WHAT'S CAN YOU FEEL THAT IN A LITTLE BIT MORE THE ACT OF THE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS AND- THE TIMING OF IT AND- WHERE WILL THE WORK BE DONE SO ABOUT SIX YEARS AGO- CALTRANS THEIR OF HIGH SPEED RAIL STARTED- ENTERED INTO AN INTERAGENCY AGREEMENT CONTRACT WITH- CALTRANS- TO DO TO PERFORM SPECIFIC- RIGHT AWAY LEGAL DUTIES THAT ARE VERY THAT ARE VERY CARILLO. THEY ALREADY PERFORM UP FOR HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION UNDER THIS DEAL THEY'RE ABLE TO- BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THE WORK FOR MUCH LESS HOURLY RATE THAN THEY WOULD IF THEY WENT- IF THEY CONTRACTED THAT SERVICE OUTSIDE SO- THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES WE'VE BEEN% WE'VE WE'VE COME BACK THE LEGISLATURE EVERY TWO YEARS- ON THIS SO THIS DOESN'T NECESSARILY REPRESENT AN INCREASE THIS REPRESENTS A CONTINUATION OF THE FOURTEEN EMPLOYEES IN THE CALTRANS LEGAL DEPARTMENT THAT HAVE BEEN DEDICATED. TO THIS- TO THE SERVICE IT ALSO FIRST MET SO THEIR THEIR SERVICE IS ONLY AS NEEDED SO BUT- BUT THE FOURTEENTH OF P. WISE YOU KNOW BASED ON HISTORY IS ABOUT THE RIGHT NUMBER FOR THE FOR THE SERVICES THIS. THIS WOULD ALL HAVE TO DO OF- WITH WORK BEING DONE IN THE SAN VALLEY. HE SAID THE BAKER AREA. OKAY THANK YOU- C. THIS CALL- ON THE- CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL ON THE WORKERS COMPENSATION AUGMENTATION- CAN SOMEONE TALK TO WHAT IS DRIVING THE INCREASE COSTS OF FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION- AND AS WE'RE YOU KNOW WE HAVE MANY VACANCIES IN C. H. B. WHAT CAN WE EXPECT AS FAR AS- FILLING THOSE. VACANCIES AND AT THE SAME TIME TO INCREASE COSTS FOR WORKERS COMP. CAPPY ARE- CAPPING NAP. WE'VE GOT THE MCLEOD- ARE YOU ONLINE FROM FORMING FINANCED. FOR CASTING A CLOUD DEPARTMENT FINANCE I'M SORRY I JUST HEARD MY NAME I WAS IN THE OTHER HEARING. THE QUESTION IS BEING ASKED REGARDING- THE WORKERS COMPENSATION- THE WORKERS COMPENSATION REQUEST ON THE CHP AND- WHAT'S DRIVING THAT AND- SO YOU KNOW HOW HOW HOW HOW DO WE GET THERE AND HOW THE SECOND IMPACT THE ABILITY TO HIRE. ADDITIONAL WELL CURRENTLY CHP. AS A VACANCY IN OFFICERS IN THE OUTLOOK THAT HAS BEEN ABLE TO COVER THAT INCREASES IN THE WORK ME WORKERS COMP BOTH IN THEIR SKIVVIES AND IN THEIR USAGE OF WORKERS COMP. SO BY FINDING THE DIFFERENCE THAT THEY'VE USED TO ABSORB TO COVER THAT COST THAT WILL FREE UP. V. REDIRECTED FUNDING AND THAT CAN COVER APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED SEVENTY OFFICERS. AND I BELIEVE CHP IS ALSO ONLINE IF THEY WANT TO ADD ANYTHING. WE'LL MISS MACLEOD DO YOU- DO YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS DRIVING THE INCREASE COSTS IN WORKERS COMPENSATION. I CAN GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT OKAY OKAY. I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT I DO THINK- ALL OF THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN AT ONCE I BELIEVE THAT THE COST OF BEEN GOING UP OVER TIME AND BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN. SOME VACANCIES AT CHP FOR A WHILE THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO ABSORB THE COST OVER A PERIOD OF TIME IT'S JUST NOW FOR- YES WE PUT TOGETHER A PLAN SO THAT WE CAN YOU KNOW FOR HIGHER FULLY WE WANT TO ALSO FULLY- FULLY BUDGET FOR THE- WORKERS COMP COSTS. WELL YES THANK YOU AND I JUST- IT STANDS OUT IS QUITE A LARGE AMOUNT FORTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS. YEAH I THINK IT'S BEEN. A LITTLE BIT OVER A OT OF YEARS OKAY IF YOU CAN GIVE ME A FEEL THAT AND I WOULD APPRECIATE IT. SENATE MORNING THIS IS TRUCKING FROM C. H. P. IF I COULD ADD JUST A LITTLE BIT SURE THANK YOU YES LIKE KERN COUNTY AND STEVE BOTH INDICATED THESE COSTS HAVE BEEN GOING ON THROUGHOUT THE YEARS AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ABSORB THEM- WE ARE- PRACTICALLY AND WE HAVE A VERY PROACTIVE HIRING CAMPAIGN RIGHT NOW VACANCIES- SONY'S COST THE RELATED TO SKIP FEES WHEN WE HAVEN'T HAD NOT- THIS IS LEAVING. OFFICE YEAR TWO THOUSAND TEN A WELL AND THEN OTHER COSTS- OVER A TRIBUTE TO WORKERS COMP IN MEDICAL COSTS WHICH I BELIEVE IT WAS- FISCAL YEAR I THINK IT WAS- TWO OH THREE SINCE WE HAD A LAST AUGMENTATION SO WITH THOSE TWO IT ADDS UP TO THE REQUESTED FORTY THREE POINT SIX MILLION. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER KING. CENTER COURTESY DID YOU HAVE. COULD YOU SEE A SIGNATURE- POACHER'S FINISH SPEAKING OF EARLY EARLIER I WAS TRYING TO MAKE SURE WAS IN THE CORRECT- THE GENDER AREA HERE OF CONCERN- A COUPLE QUESTIONS ON ON THE PROCUREMENT SIDE ON THE DESIGN BUILD PROCUREMENT AUTHORITY I'M INTEREST IS. AND BEING SATISFIED BY- BY THE BY THEMODIFICATION ON THE DESIGN BUILD IN THE DEAL THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS IN THE JOB ORDER CONTRACTING BUT A WAIT IN S. THAT- YOU KNOW AFTER. AFTER HEARING A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT- ABOUT THE DESIGN BUILD IT IT IT SEEMS LIKE- THE IT IT WASN'T VERY LONG AGO THAT WE THAT WE PUT A CAP. ON THE NUMBER PROJECTS CALTRANS IS AUTHORIZED TO DO A DESIGN BUILD IT I'M UNDERSTAND THIS TO BE- MODIFYING THAT THAT CAP- BUT IT WAS IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS PRETTY DEBATED OF LAST YEAR BEFORE BEING SIGNED INTO LAW SO I'M JUST I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT'S CHANGED OR WITH THE THINKING IS AT THIS MOMENT. ASSEMBLY PROTESTED THIS AGAIN YEARS CAN YOU HEAR ME YES I CAN'T THANK YOU. GREAT ZERO I'M LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR CALTRANS AND DO WE PUT THIS FORWARD BECAUSE SINCE LAST YEAR WITH THE I. IJA BEING PASSED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. ARE WE SEE A LOT MORE I NEED TO DELIVER A LOT MORE PROJECTS TO CALTRANS AND SO WE ANTICIPATE. I NEED APPROVED. SIX PROJECTS PER YEAR COULD POTENTIALLY USE A DESIGN BUILD AUTHORITY- TO MOVE MORE SWIFTLY AND MORE EFFICIENTLY THROUGH THE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND MAKE THE DEPARTMENT. MORE ADDITIVE FOR I JUST HAD A ROLE TRANSPORTATION FUNDS RIGHT NOW THE CAP IS SET AT TEN PROJECTS AND WE'RE USING FIVE OF THOSE SLOTS AND SO IF WE WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO. USE AS MANY AS SIX A YEAR- WE WOULD NEED ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY BUT IT WOULD BUT. A JOB HUNTING. WOULD WHO THE DETAIL THEN ON THE PART BY IT UP TO ANOTHER SIX OR ANOTHER TEN PERHAPS TO CREATE A LITTLE BUFFER THEIR LITTLE PADDING OR IT JUST I'M NOT CLEAR. THAT WE WANT TO IN PURPOSE TO THE AT THIS POINT. ELIMINATE THE CAP I'M I'M NOT SURE THAT WE DON'T. BUT THE I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I'M THAT'S WHAT I'M GETTING AT. IS I GUESS PART WRAPPED UP IN THEIR QUESTION IS WHAT'S THE EXPERIENCE BEEN THUS FAR AND DO WE HAVE A SAMPLE SIZE. YOU KNOW WITH THE FIVE THAT- I GET IT THAT YOU'RE JUST. INTO THOSE PROJECTS NOW BUT- WHAT WE HAVE IN TERMS OF EVIDENCE ABOUT HOW THAT'S GOING- CLEARLY SOMEBODY FEELS LIKE HE MUST FEEL LIKE IT'S A GOOD THING IT'S GOING WELL TO BE PROPOSING THIS BUT- I GUESS I'M LOOKING FOR A LITTLE MORE DETAIL WE COULD TAKE THAT OFFLINE. OF THAT'S A BILLABLE OR IF IT'S SOMETHING DALY ALWAYS IS LOOKING AT CURRENTLY IF THAT'S THE THROUGH THE NATURE MY QUESTION. WE'VE HAD- TERM PROJECTS USE THIS THERE WERE. FIVE PROJECTS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY UNDER THE EXISTING AUTHORITY. HE PROJECTS IN A PILOT PROGRAM AND THEY SHOW THERE'S CLEARLY- A LOT OF SAVINGS IN TERMS OF TIME- EVEN AT THE AWARD UP TO DESIGN BUILD CONTRACTS THERE'S BEEN AT LEAST A YEAR OF SAVINGS- AND- CERTAINLY OUR COST SAVINGS AS WELL IN THE ORDER OF TEN PERCENT. A PROJECT COST TO THAT JACKIE WARD OF THOSE CONTRACTS AND SO- WE ARE ALSO YOU KNOW PUTTING TOGETHER MORE INFORMATION AS PROJECTS CLOSE OUT TO SHOW THAT THE FULL LIFE CYCLE AND WE WILL BE HAPPY DID SPEAK OFFLINE FURTHER IF YOU'D LIKE. THE I. EIGHT EIGHT THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL I AM AM NOT LOOKING FOR I'M JUST I'M LOOKING FOR A THUMBNAIL SKETCH YOU KNOW THE- SORT OF THE TOP LINE YOU KNOW EXPERIENCE THE SPUR OF THE OF CHANGE ORDERS. BEEN A PROBLEM HAD THEY BEEN. TO THE- COMPETITIVE BIDDING PER. PER SE- THE COST SAVINGS YOU JUST TALK ABOUT THIS VERY INTERESTING TO BE. INTERESTING TO JUST MAYBE GET ANOTHER SENSOR TO ON. ON HOW AND WHY THAT OCCURRED OR WHAT THE BET WHAT YOU'RE BENCHMARKING THAT 10% AGAINST- I THINK EVERYONE JUST WANTS TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT IT'S I THINK MOST OF US HAVE- HERO LOCAL EXPERIENCE FURTHER EXPERIENCE WITH DESIGN BUILD THAT'S- SOLID. BUT I THINK. THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY FOR YOU KNOW FOR ASKING A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW YOUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN SUPPORT ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU. HERE YOU HAVE THOSE FIVE PROJECTS NELSON THANK YOU LOOK FORWARD TO FOLLOWING UP WITH YOU AND- HOPEFULLY WHATEVER YOU COME UP WITH CAN BE SHARED WITH EVERYONE HERE ON THE DAIS. ON THE JOB ORDER CONTRACTING. THIS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I'VE HAD- EXPERIENCE WITH US A COUNTY OFFICIAL. PLUS AND MINUS- GOOD AND BAD IN ITS DIRECTORS. THE CONCERN I HAVE BEEN AGAIN IT'S MOSTLY ABOUT NOT SEEN DETAILS HERE. IS WHAT ARE THE LIMITATIONS- YOU KNOW ON THE JOB ORDER CONTRACTING GOING TO BE. OF HOW MUCH CUMULATIVE JOB ORDER CONTRACT JOB ORDER CONTRACTING- WILL BE ALLOWED BEFORE- BEFORE A REPEATED YOU KNOW BEFORE YOU HAVE TO GET- GO TO A MORE TRADITIONAL PROCESS- IT'S JUST THAT KIND OF DETAIL IN IN THESE. TO BEGIN MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT THOSE DETAILS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S NOT- SOME OF THE VERY THINGS THAT COMPETITIVE BIDDING WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED I THINK TO. TO SOLVE OR TO SATISFY WHICH IS YOU KNOW PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT OVER LACK OF DIVERSITY IN IN IT BIDDERS OR YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY HAVING. UP WITH EVEN IF IT'S AN OVERLY THE SAME- CONTRACTORS AND UP- OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN- YOU KNOW GETTING THAT THE- ON IT WOULD BE GETTING THE STATE FUNDING TO DO THE WORK- IT JUST BECAUSE IT AT THE END OF. GUARDRAILS HAVE BEEN PUT INTO THE JOB ORDER CONTRACTING SCHEME THAT YOU'RE USING SO AGAIN DETAILS ON THAT WHICH AGAIN I'M HAPPY TO TAKE OFF LINE UNLESS YOU WANT TO. ADDRESS SAID NO. A U. S. SENATOR BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS THOSE OFFLINE JUST REALLY QUICK I KNOW. WITH SOME OF THE WAY THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT IMPLEMENTING MESSAGES WITH THREE YEAR CONTRACTS WITH. RENEWALS EVERY YEAR I WITHIN THE CONTRACT TERMS SO THAT WE COULD EVALUATE PERFORMANCE AND LOOK AT THE- THE EXPERIENCING YOU KNOW. WHAT FUNDING THOSE CONTRACTS MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE COMPETITIVE THEY WOULD BE- COMPETITIVELY BID BASED ON A UNIT PRICE BOOK- AND SO THEY'LL BE MARKUPS FINDING THE- BY THE CONTRACTORS. AND THEN WE WOULD- EVALUATE THOSE UNITS I SPOKE. FIVE AND SO WE'D BE HAPPY TO SPEAK MORE OFFLINE ABOUT HOW WE WOULD DO THAT. YEAH GREAT AT JUST LOOKING FOR THE MODEL THERE'S NOT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY TO.

REMARKS AND WE'RE HAPPY. MY FATHER LMAO COLLEAGUES ON. HEARING TO QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR MUCH- THERE ARE SEVERAL AREAS IN THIS THAT- PROBABLY HAVE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ON MAYBE WE COULD- DO THE MALL AT THE SAME TIME BY SECTION SO WHY DON'T WE START WITH- CORRECTIONS. ANY ANYTHING ON CORRECTIONS AND THEN WILL GO TO JUDICIARY AND PUBLIC SAFETY AND THE OTHER SECTIONS SIR NEWMAN. THANK YOU MANAGER JOB WANT TO TOUCH BASE ON- BUT PRISON CLOSURES MR EDELMAN NOTED THAT I THINK IT'S OUR COLLECTIVE THREE PRISONS MAYBE STATE FOR CLOSURE AND IN. THE NEAR AL YEARS- ANY PREVIOUS COVERAGE WE WE'VE WE'VE ADDRESS QUESTIONS TO- AND TO THE ANSWER COMING BACK WAS IT THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS HOLLOW IT'S DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY THOSE PRISONS MOREOVER IS A BIG IMPACT ON THOSE COMMUNITIES SO IT'S SOMETHING TO BE. TO TREAD LIGHTLY AROUND BUT- IT OBVIOUSLY HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR BUDGETING AND A COUPLE AREAS A CAP OUT LASERS I THINK MR SODERBERGH NOTED- ALSO BELIEVE THIS BROADER QUESTION EXCESS CAPACITY NINE SHOULD BE YOU KNOW SOMEONE EXTRA EXCESS CAPACITY WILL BE ADDRESSED. THROUGH THOSE CLOSURES SHOW THAT TO MR EDELMAN HOW CAN WE- THIS COMMITTEE BUT THE LEGISLATURE MARGINALLY GET GREATER INSIGHT AS TO WHERE THE CLUB WHICH MIGHT TAKE PLACE. THAT SHOW THAT THAT CAN INFORM SOME OF THE OTHER DISCUSSIONS AROUND BUDGING AS I MENTIONED. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION THAT ANY IT'S A REALLY GOOD ONE ANY IS A DAY. AND THAT WE DO NEED TO MAKE THESE NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE NVESTMENTS A LOT OF THEM HAVE TO DO WITH- GARCIA POPULATION HEALTH CARE KIND OF. YOU KNOW SAFETY OR FIRE LIFE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE INSTITUTIONS WE DO PRIORITIZE OUR ON CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. YOU KNOW ON A YEAR TO YEAR BASIS THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS AND TO PRIORITIZE THOSE INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVEN'T URGENT AND IMMEDIATE NEED- BUT IT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WE BALLOTS AND TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WE'RE PLANNING FOR LONGER TERM OUTLOOKS- BUT AS YOU MENTIONED IT IS KIND OF A DIFFICULT PROCESS AND- IF THERE ARE ESSENTIAL. NEEDS ANYTHING BACK. WHILE KIND OF BALANCING PROJECTIONS THEY GO INTO THE FUTURE. BUT LIKE MIGHT NOT BE CERTAIN. INCEPTION THE AND OTHERS HAVE H. FOR YOU YOU KNOW THIS IS A ONGOING. QUESTION GENTLY YOU HOME YOU KNOW THE SUPPOSED TO GO IS REDUCE THE PRISON BY. SHIP DO YOU KNOW BY A- FORGET HAVE TO. WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT REDUCING THE NUMBER OF FACILITIES- BUT I THINK MORE PORTLY TO YOUR POINT WITH YOU KNOW THEIR WHOLE BUNCH OF. RELATED CONSIDERATIONS- THAT COME INTO INVESTORS THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT AUTHORIZED. SO OBVIOUSLY IN NEED OF FURTHER DISCUSSION EITHER YOU KNOW IN SPITE YOUR FUTURE CONVERSATIONS OF THANKS. THANK YOU SEVEN NEWMAN. THE COURTESY. IT CAN ASSUME OUT A LITTLE BIT AND A DO AGREE WITH THEM. CENTER NEWMAN CONCERT WE JUST SAY STATE- ON THE RECORD WE TALKED ABOUT IT IN THE- BUT I THINK. THE TIS COMMITTEE. I THINK THE MAJORITY THIS COMMITTEES. OF BEEN. REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT- THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN ENCLOSURE BECAUSE WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE CRITERIA IS FOR CLOSURE WITH THE SCHEDULE IS- IS IT KIND OF SOUNDED LIKE THAT HASN'T BEEN DEVELOPED IN PAST HEARINGS BUT I JUST WANTED TO GO BACK TO THE CRITERIA BECAUSE YOU MOUNT A LITTLE BIT- YOU TO SENATOR NEWMAN AYE- ACTUALLY TOURED- ONE OF THE PRISONERS RECENTLY AND IT WOULD BE PRETTY CLEAR TO ME WITHOUT HAVING ANY KIND OF FORMAL CRITERIA AT THAT PARTICULAR LOCATION. WOULD NOT BE- WOULD PROBABLY NOT BE DOES NEED FOR CLOSURE BASED ON THE POPULATION- AND YOU KNOW THE SENSE OF THE POPULATION ALTHOUGH OBVIOUSLY POPULATIONS CAN BE MOVED- SO I'M I'M UNCLEAR ON JUST WOULD. AGAIN USE THAT TERM TOPLINE I MEAN WHAT ARE THE BASIC CRITERIA THAT ARE IN PLAY- ADEQUACY OF THE BOTH OF THE FACILITIES- THE- NEED FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY. IT IS THAT. IT SOMEBODY MUST BE WORKING OFF SOME BASIC CRITERIA AT THIS POINT BECAUSE TOOL AND- AND- HERE AND THEN THE STAND THIS IS A BILLS FACILITY. YOU KNOW HAVE HAVE HAVE ALREADY BEEN MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION SOMEBODY APPLIED SOME CRITERIA THAT AND I GUESS MAYBE THAT'S THE REAL QUESTION IS THAT IS BASICALLY THE SAME CRITERIA IT'S GONNA BE EXTENDED OUT AND IF SO- HOW DO WE GET OUR HANDS ON THAT SURE NACHSHON QUESTIONING AND SENATOR THIS IS JUST NEWMAN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THERE IS EXISTING CRITERION PENAL CODE SECTION TWENTY SIXTY SEVEN WHICH INCLUDES FACTORS INCLUDE BUT AREN'T LIMITED TO THE COST TO OPERATE THE FACILITY SO KIND OF THOSE INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS. BUT ALSO THE WORK FORCE AND TAXED AT A LOCAL- COMMUNITY A SUBPOPULATION GENDER SPECIFIC HOUSING NEEDS DEPENDING ON EACH FACILITY THEY KIND OF HAVE THEIR INDIVIDUAL PURPOSES AND CAN POPULATIONS- LONG TERM INVESTMENTS OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW PROGRESS INSTEAD OF MAY MATER DEFINITELY CONSIDERED ONE WORK FACTORING IN KIND OF WHAT CRITERIA WE'RE LOOKING AT. TAKE IN REHABILITATION AGAIN SO OF DEPENDING ON THE PRIORITY OF INSTANT AND WE POPULOUS IT SERVES AND KIND OF JUST TERRIBLE ONGOING SOLUTIONS FOR PRISON OVERCROWDING POPULAR. A SITUATION. SO RECENTLY THAT INCLUDES CERTAIN THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW IN THE SAFETY AND ANALYTE AND I MAKING KIND OF VARIOUS FACTORS WITH THE HEALTH OF THE POPULATION- BUT THERE ARE EXISTING FACTORS STATE BANK MINISTRATION DOES CONSIDER WHEN CONSIDERING PRESENTS TO CLOSE- AND THEY ARE VERY COMPLICATED AND- OBVIOUSLY AND MISS EDUCATED BY. THINGS LIKE THE IMPACT TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY HAS TO MENTION- WITH CLOSURE OF. THE INSTITUTIONS. USING ABOUT. BUT WHEN START MOVING YOU KNOW I IT IS BECAUSE- IN- THERE'S- YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF A PUZZLE IS THE WAY I WOULD DESCRIBE IT WITH WITH MOVABLE PIECES AND- IN IN. IT WOULD SEEM TO RESULT IN A SET OF OPTIONS OR ALTERNATIVES- SCENARIO A SCENARIO B. IT IS IT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE AN EXERCISE IN SCENARIO PLANNING- IN IN IF SO IT WOULD SEEM THAT THERE'S SOME RANK. B. TO. GO FOR CORRECTIONAL STUDENTS TO BUILT YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW I I'M JUST IMAGINE THIS IN INTERNALLY SO TO SPEAK- THAT THERE'S MAYBE A SCHEDULE IS SCHEDULED BE A SCHEDULE C. DEPENDING ON HOW HIGH YOU WAIT THOSE THOSE MOVING PARTS THAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED IF THAT'S THE CASE THAT IT I GET IT THAT IT WOULD BE SENSITIVE TO- YOU KNOW RELEASE DETAILS LIKE THAT PARTICULARLY WITH. THE COMMUNITY IMPACT PEACE IN MIND BUT- HOW MUCH OF THAT CAN WE CAN WE COME TO UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW AT THIS POLICY LOW. I GUESS WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS MUCH OF THAT INFORMATION AS WE CAN- WITHOUT PREMATURELY. YOU KNOW- YOU KNOW PUTTING INFORMATION OUT THERE IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE. I UNDERSTAND AND AGREE COMPLETELY AND WE REMAIN COMMITTED TAKE HAVING CONTINUING ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON IN PARTICULAR THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON KIND OF WHAT FACTORS WITH CONSIDERING AND OPTIONS. OKAY WELL WE'LL KEEP ASKING IN- YOU KNOW I WOULD. EXCEPT IN EXPECT THAT WE WILL GET INFORMATION BACK INCREMENTALLY ASSIST DEVELOPED AND IT'S SUITABLE FOR RELEASE BUT- YOU KNOW I ALSO- JOB IS NOT TO ASSUME THINGS BUT TO. THE REQUESTED TO KEEP ASKIN SO- BOOK FORTY GETTING INFORMATION IS S SOON AS YOU GET IT TO US THANK YOU. COMMITTER THANK YOU SENATOR CORTEZ THE- DO YOU COULD SENSE FROM AT LEAST THREE OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. THAT WE HAVE ASKED FOR INFORMATION. PLEASE AS LONG AS- TWO THREE YEARS NOW WE'VE BEEN HERE- TO HELP US MAKE THESE DECISIONS. ALL HELP US MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS OR HELP SUPPORT. ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S DECISION AND WE KEEP COMING BACK WITH. NOTHING MORE THAN A HANDFUL OF. POTENTIAL FACTORS ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT SO HOW DO WE MAKE RESPONSIBLE DECISIONS WE KEEP ASKING THAT QUESTION WE DO NOT GET THE INFORMATION- THERE'S THE EXCESS CAPACITY OF TEN THOUSAND BEDS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. THAT YOU CONSIDER A REASONABLE- EXCESS CAPACITY- WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THAT. I RAISE THE ISSUE THAT YES THERE'S IMPACT ON COMMUNITY THE COMMUNITIES- WE ALWAYS TELL THEM. TO GO THROUGH OF A PROCESS THAT TAKES THEM INTO CONSIDERATION WHAT WOULD THE IMPACT BE OR WE THINKING THAT IT'S BEST JUST TO DROP IT ON THEM. IS THAT IS THAT HAT YOU THINK IS THE BEST OF ALL. THE WAY TO GO. I DON'T THINK SO I THINK PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO KNOW THE WANT TO PLAN- FOR ANYTHING THAT COULD BE COMING. SUCH AS THE CLOSURE SO. WHERE WE GONNA END UP HERE WE KEEP ASKING INFORMATION AND WE DON'T GET THAT PLAN WE DON'T GET THE FUNDAMENTAL INFORMATION THAT WE NEED TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS AND IT'S- IT'S I THINK IT'S DISRESPECTFUL TO THE LEGISLATURE NOT TO PROVIDE THAT BASIC INFORMATION. BUT WE'RE GOING TO GET ANY FURTHER TODAY WILL HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING ELSE- HI I HAVE A SPECIFIC QUESTION THOUGH OF FOR CDC ARE. OF WITH REGARDS TO PROJECT MANAGEMENT I THINK THIS WAS MENTIONED BY. OF ALL THE L. A. O. WITH EGARDS TO THE VOLUME OF CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS AND HOW ARE YOU MOVING FORWARD- IT'S PRETTY. PRETTY HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S GOING INTO CAPITAL OUTLAY HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE THAT. THE MANAGER MEMBERS- CHRIS LEAF WITH. CITY C. AREN'T ANY DIRECTOR FACILITY PLANNING CONSTRUCTION AND MANAGEMENT DIVISION- YEAH THAT'S YOU KNOW WE HAVE A NUMBER OF- PROJECTS MOVING FORWARD AND- WE HAVE- YEAH I READING INTO YOUR QUESTION A LITTLE BIT- I THINK- YOU'RE CONCERNED WITH HOW DO WE- PREVENT THE MISTAKES THAT WERE MADE WITH THE TECH FOR PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS GOING FORWARD- WE ARE ADDRESSING- THE LESSONS LEARNED WITH EXCEPT IN ANOTHER AND A NUMBER OF WAYS. LEE AND THE PLANNING OF NEW PROJECTS- FOR INSTANCE- WHEN WE ARE CONCEPTUALLY DEVELOPING PROJECT SCOPE COST AND SCHEDULE. WE NOW ENSURE THAT EVALUATION OF EXISTING UTILITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS IT'S INCLUDED IN THE PROCESS. ALSO IN PICKED UP WE HAD A NUMBER OF FAILURES OF WITH THEIR ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING FIRMS- AND HEALTHCARE- TWO CHILDREN CELLS FORMS WHEN THEY WERE DEFINING PROJECTS. ACCORDINGLY WE HAVE ADDED A CONTRACT LANGUAGE WITH THOSE FIRMS IT CLEARLY IDENTIFY THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES WORK FIELD VERIFICATION OF SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS I DON'T CREATION OF UNDERGROUND UTILITIES AND DESTRUCTIVE TESTING TO THE EXTENT FEASIBLE WITH THEM. OPERATING FACILITIES LET'S MOVE ON NOW TO- TO JUDICIARY. I THINK MAY HAVE THE- MOST THE- ISSUES AND- AND QUESTIONS HERE ARE I DON'T KNOW WHO'S GOING TO ANSWER THAT ON BEHALF OF THE ADMINISTRATION ALL I'M SORRY BY THE WAY- THE DAILY- HAVE ANY OTHER ISSUES ON CORRECTIONS I BELIEVE YOU ADDRESS THEM BUT- IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE. THOSE OF. WE ARE PREPARED REMARKS ON ON THEM BUT IF THERE'S ANY PARTICULAR- PROPOSAL WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S NAME REGIONALLY BY DEFAULT THE PRINCIPLE OF MORAL. OKAY. FOR OKAY- OKAY WITH TO JUDY- I DO HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS AND I THINK FOLLOWING ALONG WITH WITH THE L. A. O. OF THE ISSUES THAT THE L. A- RAISED- WE KNOW THAT THE- CARE COURT PROPOSAL IS STILL BEING WORKED OUT AND IT. COVERS AND CROSSES ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AREAS- I THINK WHAT IS BEFORE US MIGHT BE JUST A GUESS I WITH THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IS GOING TO NEED- MY CONCERN I HOW DO WE- ENSURE. THAT THE WORKLOAD OF FOR THE COURTS- DOESN'T OVERWHELM THE EXISTING TRIAL COURT DUTIES- HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS TO LEGAL COUNSEL. AND DUE PROCESS ARE PROTECTED- I THINK THAT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH HOW MANY PETITIONS DO YOU EXPECT- HOW DO PEOPLE FILE THEM ARE THERE-FILING FEES. I DON'T THINK ANY OF THESE ARE OF FINALLY- DECIDED- IN TERMS OF MOVING FORWARD BUT- BEYOND THE FUNDING FOR THE JUDICIAL BRANCH- ARE THERE ENOUGH SERVICES SUCH AS BEDS AND BE BEHAVE. FACILITIES THAT YOU GET A BUILDER REFER PARTICIPANTS TO SO. IF THERE ARE ANY NORMA'S NUMBER OF OPEN QUESTIONS SO IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE THE FUNDING THE BUDGET SIDE OF THAT WITHOUT THAT FOG CONTEXT- SO- I DON'T KNOW WHO. WILL RESPOND TO THAT. HI- TOM MARKHAM THE PART OF FINE- I CAN. RESPOND TO THE POINTS THAT YOU'VE MADE IN THE IN THE ARE ALL REALLY GREAT POINTS AND- WE'VE KNOWLEDGE THAT THAT THE- THE POLICY FOR THE CARE COURT IT'S STILL UNDER- UNDER- THERE IS STILL BEING DEVELOPED AND ADDS YOU'VE ALSO NOTED DEFENSE AND OTHER- OTHER AGENCIES UNDER THE- THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES- BUT THE PROPOSAL FOR YOU IT'S REALLY SPECIFIC TO THE DISTAL BRANCHEN AND YEAH AND MAYBE TO ADDRESS YOUR YOUR FIRST ARE CONCERNED WITH REGARDS TO. THE IMPACTS TO THE JUDICIAL BRANCH AND YOU KNOW I'M THE USER BY. WE RECOGNIZE. THAT AIRPORT WILL- I WILL WORK MORE OF THE-BRANCH IN. THIS IS CERTAINLY WHY HAVE- IDENTIFY. THESE IT DOES. THESE COSTS INCLUDE THESE- APPOINTED THESE. WITH THEM- THE GIRL FAVOR. TO- THEY'RE NOT- THE ADDITIONAL. ON THE TO DO BRANCH AND TO THEM THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO- TO YOU KNOW BY. WE CONTINUE THEIR CURRENT SERVICE THEIR CURRENT OPERATIONS BUT ALSO TO TAKE ON THIS ADDITIONAL WORK LOAD- NOW WE- WE'VE ALSO INCLUDED RESOURCES FOR SELF HELP CENTERS. TO- GUY. TO SOMEHOW SAN IN ALL FIFTY EIGHT- I- TO ASSIST- IT IN THE- WHO- BY MY- ONCE READ THE OR AT S. LEVEL IN. BEING PART OF THAT THAT THEY CARE- THE IN IN A LOT OF YOUR I FEEL LIKE A LOT OF YOUR YOUR QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS ARE THE RE REALLY DEPENDS ON HOW THE POLICY WILL- WILL. LAND AT THE AT THE END OF THE DAY AND AS YOU HAVE NOTED IS STILL BEING UNDERDEVELOPED AND YOU KNOW- WERE OR- WERE TAKING NOTE OF THE CONCERNS THAT ARE BEING RAISED BY- BY YOUR- BY YOU YOURSELF OFF YOUR- YOUR STAFF AND HAS ALL THE L. A. O. WERE- LOOKING FOR TO CONTINUE WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH. THE LEGISLATURE- IN IN- REFINING THE POLICY I- AND MAKING SURE THAT I. D. THE- FIVE. IS IT IS IN PLACE AND EVERYONE IS SET UP TO. DO YOU HAVE- MISS. I GUESS THE GET AT THIS I KNOW HOW YOU IT I HER THE NOT- SOMEWHERE ABOUT. THE POTENTIAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT COULD FILE THE PETITIONS MAYBE I GOT THIS CONFUSED WITH SOMEWHERE AROUND. SEVEN THOUSAND MAYBE GOT THAT CONFUSED WITH ANOTHER NUMBER BUT- HOW ARE YOU TO MAKE THIS KIND OF A REQUEST- FOR THIRTY NINE MILLION FROM THE GENERAL FUND. I KNOW THERE'S ADDITIONAL OF FUNDING FOR THE TRIAL COURT FACILITIES BUT WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU SO FAR BASE IT OFF OF SO THAT WE COULD KNOW. HOW TO RESPOND TO THE SPECIFIC REQUEST THAT'S BEING MADE. SO OUR OUR OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS THAT MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR ON THE CARE PROGRAM IS BETWEEN SEVEN TO TWELVE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS AND THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU ASSUMES- THE- THAT THE MIDPOINTS ABOUT TEN THOUSAND- HEY INDIVIDUALS PARTICIPATING IN THE CARE PROGRAM. AND BASED ON THAT IS THIS- THIS ITEM FOR UP THIRTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS AND THEN SOME ADDITIONAL TWELVE COURT FACILITY FUNDING. THE B. TRACKWORK BASILIDES FINDINGS ARM ARE SEPARATE AND APART FROM THE CARE FOR OKAY SO IT'S REALLY TO- FOR OF EXISTING I'M PROJECTS AND- OR ANY EXISTING FACILITY. SO THE- FUNDING FOR THIRTY NINE AND A HALF MILLION THAT'S THE AMOUNT THAT YOU BELIEVE WILL COVER THE APPROXIMATELY TEN THOUSAND. CASES CORRECT THAT'S WORK ENOUGH YES GOOD OKAY- MEMBERS ON THE CARE COURT. I KNOW I AM SORRY I HAD ONE MORE IS- I THEIR COURT FEES- ARE YOU THINKING OF A- ADDING COURT FEES IN THIS. COURT PROCESS. WORK- CURRENTLY HAS FORTY AREN'T REFLECTED IN THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE SPELL CONI'M AND I'M I'M NOT AWARE. OF ANY DISCUSSIONS WITH WITH INCORPORATING ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME OKAY. AND UP HAVE YOUTH- THOUGHT ABOUT RULES CREWS GOING TO PROVIDE LEGAL ASSISTANCE. SO- WOULD BE AS THE THIRTEENTH EIGHT FOR- PUBLIC THE CORE TO APPOINT A PUBLIC DEFENDER AS WELL AS THIS- OFF FOR THE- FOR THE PART TO. ON I WE ARE- THEY WERE BE REACHED. ARE THERE MAY BE SOME FOR THE OFFICE OF. THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE- AS PART OF THIS. EFFORT OKAY DO YOU KNOW IF THAT INCLUDE IN THE THREE NINE AND A HALF MILLION. IT'S NOT PART OF THE THIRTY NINE AND A HALF BILLION IT IS PART OF- IT'S STILL ON SOMETHING ABOUT THE INITIATION IS STILL DEVELOPING- AND FOR WORKING WITH LOCALS ON TO BETTER UNDERSTAND- AND FINALIZE OUR ESTIMATES. OKAY THAT'S IT FOR ME YES SENATE QUARTERS YES OF COURSE IS THIS IS SOMETHING OF A OF STATED- UNIT IN A NUMBER OF PER MEETINGS BUT NOT AT THIS COMMITTEE OR AND I'M SURE IN A PUBLIC HEARING- IN TERMS CARE COURT THAT I. THINK NEEDS TO BE OUT. ON THE RECORD- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. THE ONLY PREFACE BY SAYING THAT I PUBLICLY SUPPORTED YOU KNOW THIS THIS DIRECTION THIS CONCEPT OF CARE COURT BE PER TO- ANY KIND OF LEGISLATIVE LANGUAGE EVEN BEING INTRODUCED. THE EXPLANATION. HE HANDED THAT I'VE BEEN GIVEN IN IN SOME OF THAT'S BEEN DIRECTLY BY THE GOVERNOR- HAS BEEN THAT. IT AT SOME LEVEL THIS IS INTENDED TO- HE BEAT THE FACT TO EXTENSION OF THE FIFTY ONE FIFTY OR FIFTY TO FIFTY PROCESS FOR PEOPLE PARTICULAR PSYCHOSIS AND SCHIZOPHRENIA WHO. MIGHT BE A HARM TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS AND THEREFORE- THERE THERE WOULD BE TO BE. PLANS- MANDATED CARE OF FOR A PERIOD OF TIME THAT WOULD EXTEND BEYOND WHAT'S CURRENTLY AVAILABLE THROUGH TODAY STATURE TODAY'S PROCESSES- WHICH DON'T EVEN ALLOW HOLDS YOU KNOW FOR LONGER THAN THE FIFTY TO FIFTY PERIOD CERTAINLY NOTHING LIKE THIRTY DAYS- IN AND I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY GREAT BECAUSE MY OWN. EXPERIENCE AS AS A PUBLIC OFFICIAL IN AN OTHERWISE HAS BEEN- AROUND THE POPULATION WHO- IS DIAGNOSED THAT WAY- THAT- THEY NEED THEY NEED BEDS SHORT TERM BEFORE GOING TO STEP DOWN FACILITIES- YOU KNOW SO THAT THEIR STABILIZATION PERIOD IS ENOUGH TO GET THEM. TO THE TO THAT NEXT STEP OF STEP DOWN FACILITIES AND OF COURSE IN ESSENCE MAINSTREAMING BACK INTO SOCIETY- ALL THAT REQUIRES AND BRING THIS BACK THE BUDGET HERE RICK WOULD REQUIRE I THINK A HUGE INVESTMENT IN- IN BEDS IN FACILITIES AND I'VE I'VE HEARD THAT STATED BY OTHERS IN IN VARIOUS DIFFERENT WAYS- I HAVE YET TO SEE ANY KIND OF CORRESPONDING INVESTMENT COME FORWARD. IN A NEWS. RELEASE ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES- FROM LEGISLATIVE STAMP- INTRODUCED. BACK IN JANUARY OR FEBRUARY THAT WAS LOOKING. AHEAD TO MAKE JUST A VERY DIRECT INVESTMENT INTO- PSYCH BEDS I MEAN THAT'S HOW HE REFERRED TO IN HIS BILL- SO YOU KNOW I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF TENSION AROUND THIS CONCEPT IN. AROUND THIS IDEA OF YOU KNOW LET'S NOT MANDATE LOCKING PEOPLE UP- I AGREE WITH THAT AS WELL- BUT- TO THE EXTENT THAT- A CARE PLAN- PRESCRIBED NOT JUST BY A JUDGE POPE COULD PRESCRIBE BY THOSE QUALIFIED TO DIAGNOSE- THE INDIVIDUAL'S CONDITION IN THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT IS GOING TO TAKE TO STABILIZE THEM. REQUIRES BETS REQUIRES FACILITIES THOSE FACILITIES JUST AREN'T HERE YET AND I JUST DON'T BELIEVE I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT. APPS THE INVESTMENT IN IN ROM KEY- HERE AND IN OTHER PROGRAMS SAID FRANKLY ARE MORE DESIGNED FOR- THE GENERAL AND HOUSE POPULATION OUT THERE THAT YOU KNOW HOMES POPULATION THAT SOMEHOW. THOSE COULD WORK OF FOR THESE PURPOSES IT BUT THOSE ARE NOT. HEALTH CARE. PSYCH BEDS FOR BED SAID. YOU NORMALLY WOULD SEE TWENTY FOUR HOUR WRAPAROUND SERVICES ON SO I JUST WANT TO PUT IT OUT THERE THAT I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT SINCE WE ARE IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE- THIS IS BUT BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE OF BROTHER- IN IN YOU KNOW I AGAIN I'VE TRIED MADAM CHAIR AND I THINK YOU KNOW ANYTHING COME SIR NEWMAN SAID HER ME AT LEAST. COMMENT ON THIS BEFORE IN IN VARIOUS OTHER FORMS- BUT IT BUT I DON'T THINK I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR IS I MEAN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE PROPOSAL BUT A I JUST THINK THAT- WE NEED TO BE VERY VERY CAREFUL YOU KNOW NOT TO CREE IN EFFECT. A HUGE FOR IN TERMS OF AN UNFUNDED ASPECT OF WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO BE REQUIRED. TO MAKE THIS WORK. THANK YOU. GREAT REMARKS YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I THINK IT'S A IT'S A SIMILAR CONVERSATION AND DISCUSSION THAT'S HAD ABOUT OUR OWN HOUSE. OF HOW WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM WE DON'T WANT THEM TO SUFFER ON THE STREETS LIVE IN TENTS LIVE IN THOSE KIND OF ENCAMPMENTS AND YET WE DON'T. WHERE DO YOU PUT A SAY TO THEM ABOUT WE WANT YOU TO LEAVE THE STREETS AND THE SIDEWALKS AND YOU'RE TENSE. AND WHAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE FOR THEM WHERE DO THEY GO TO WORK AND THEY FEEL SAFE TO GO AND IS IT GOING TO BE FOR ONE NIGHT AND TWO NIGHTS AND THEN THEY'RE BACK ON THE STREETS SO WE HAVE TO WE'RE GONNA HAVE IF THIS PLAN'S GOING TO WORK HE'S GOT A REALLY LOOK AT THE WHOLE PROCESS AND- I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING IN THE WAY THAT THAT YOU SET IT. UP BECAUSE IF WE DON'T HAVE THOSE OF SERVICES WHERE WHERE WE'RE JUST KIDDING OURSELVES THIS IS JUST COULDN'T TURN INTO SOMETHING ELSE A MANDATED TREATMENT BUT NOT REALLY THE SERVICES AND THE BEDS AND THE FACILITIES THAT THAT THEY WILL NEED TO GET BETTER. IN THEIR HEALTH- IN THE ELSE- L. A. O. AND ELSE ON THAT THAT YOU COULD ADD OR WANT TO ADD. I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO HAPPEN WILL SET OKAY THANK YOU I WILL MOVE ON TO- PUBLIC SAFETY IN TERMS OF OUR OWN COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS HERE- I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE SENTINEL ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM COORDINATED WITH THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH AND OTHER ENTITIES ON THIS.

NOW TEACHER TV HIRING PAR. GRANT PRO. HAN WITH DISMAY REVISION FOR AS AS AS FAR THE CASE ON THE- FOR. ARE COMING TO ON RATHER AND WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE. CONNECT WITH THE RELEASE OF WITH THE BOARD TO LEARN THROUGH. AS MUCH AS WE'D LIKE TO ABOUT THIS SPECIFIC PROPOSAL SO THERE ARE SOME OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS- FRIENDS INSIDE THE PROPOSAL ITSELF DOESN'T CLEAR WHAT SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES WOULD BE. THE TARGET OF THESE H. RTP GRANTS AND HOW THEY WOULD BE CONNECTED TO REDUCING EXTREME HEAT- FOR HOW THESE- PROGRAMS WOULD MEET THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF THOSE INDUSTRIES- SO. OFTEN AND QUESTIONS FOR THAT PROPOSAL- MOVING ON OUR- WOULD ONLY NOTE THAT THE- PRINTER SHIP EXPANSION PROPOSAL IN THE MAY REVISION WOULD REDIRECT SOME FUNDING THAT WAS PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROF. GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN JANUARY FOR HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIP IN HEALTH AND SOCIAL WORK FIELDS- AND SO THAT'S A COMPONENT IS BEING REDIRECTED FROM THE GOVERNOR'S SORT OF JANUARY PRIORITY TO APPRENTICESHIP. PROGRAMS IN NONTRADITIONAL. DISTRICTS ON MOVING ON TO THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT NEW INFORMATION TO. PROPOSAL FEEDING NEXT I'M AT THE SUBTREE KNOWS ARE HE DEFACED SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES DURING THE PANDEMIC OXER MANAGING IT'S UNPRECEDENTED WORKLOAD- AND IT IS GOING TO HAVE PAYMENTS- IF ON INSURANCE AND SO AS A PART OF THAT. ROSS SAYS DURING THE PANDEMIC THE EXISTING- TECHNOLOGY EFFORT THAT HAD BEEN UNDER WAY THE BENEFITS SYSTEM MODERNIZATION WAS PAUSED AND REIMAGINED AS EDT MAX'S WITH THIS THE FIRST WE'RE SEEING OUT OF THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY PROPOSAL- IN ORDER A QUICK ASSESSMENT OF THE PROPOSAL THERE ARE SOME INFORMATION THAT WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT CURRENTLY IS INCLUDING CLEANINGS ARE. ONGOING PROJECT COSTS- ESTIMATED TOTAL PROJECT COST SOME DETAILS ABOUT THAT THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT AS IT'S BEEN REIMAGINE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND TECHNOLOGY- TO GET THIS INFORMATION BUT THE THING WE DIDN'T WANT TO FLAG FOR JUST SUBCOMMITTEE ITSELF IS THAT BECAUSE THIS IS A NEW. TECHNOLOGY OFFERED EFFORT. ON THE HEEL OF LESSONS LEARNED DURING THE PANDEMIC NOW IS PROBABLY THE BEST OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO GET CLOSELY INVOLVED IN HOW THIS TECHNOLOGY EFFORT TAKE SHAPE- FINANCIAL BRING THAT THE LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. ANSWERED BY AN FROM FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE PROJECT IS THERE- SO WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND THE BROADER LEGISLATURE TO. PAY CLOSE ATTENTION THIS MAY REVISION PROPOSAL AND- ASKS. FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS AND DETAILED INFORMATIONAL QUESTIONS FROM FROM THE DEPARTMENT. ON THE FOLLOWING AS MY COLLEAGUES AND REFINE MANAGER THERE IS A IS A MAJOR REVISION AT E. D. I TWO TWO IN. FIX STAND SOME ITS FROM INVEST AND- BEYOND WHAT WAS IN GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND SHOOTING A TWELVE NO DOLLAR PUBLIC AD CAMPAIGN TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT IDENTITY THEFT I WHICH WAS A WIDESPREAD ISSUE IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM DURING THE PANDEMIC AND POTENTIALLY MORE RECENTLY IN THE STATE'S DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM WE HAVE NO SPECIFIC COMMENTS ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL BUT HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- OKAY I WILL LOVE TAKING A QUESTIONS FROM OUR OUR MEMBER- FIFTY START WHERE. WHAT EVERYONE. ABOUT DO INDEED THREE VERY LET'S AT THIRTY FIRST IN THE OVERALL TO THE OTHER. SENATE NEWMAN. I THANK YOU ENSURE. BY I GUESS QUITE FOR MR TOP THEN OR SOMEBODY D. D. PRECIADO. THE ANSWER AS THE PLAY FOR LONG TERM CAN IT TO ABOUT CHALLENGES IN WITH SEARCHES. IN DEMAND- BE WHICH WOULD EVERE DURING THE PANDEMIC'S PLEASE JOIN LIKE SOME ABOUT THE WELL LOOKING FOR AND WHETHER OR NOT THE MODERNIZATION PLANS SPECIFICALLY CONSIDER THE IMPERATIVE TO COPE WITH OR TO PREPARE FOR FUTURE SURGES. IN DEMAND OF HELPING THAT CAPACITY TO HANDLE SURGES. THANK YOU SENATOR OF HUNDRED THOUSAND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MINISTER IN THE A MAJOR PART OF THE PLANNING PROCESS AND WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS THOSE ARE THE ISSUES- THAT. WONDERFUL CONVERSATION AND I'LL THE PERSON DEPARTMENT FOR. ON HOW WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THOSE GOING FORWARD. SENATOR NANCY JERRY AS SAY THANK YOU TO THE LEDGE. I MEAN WE HER WHAT. YOU KNOW CAL. SAID YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT THE CSA SAID WHAT L. A. O. SAID- WHAT YOUR CONSTITUENTS SAID WHAT THE PUBLIC SAID AND WE ARE HERE TO MODERNIZE EDT- THAT IS. THAT IS OUR GOAL GOING FORWARD- I SORT OF STATE OF MORE POINTEDLY TO YOUR QUESTION YOU KNOW THE BEST PART ABOUT EDT NEXT IT IS AN I. T. EFFORT AS AS LBO MENTION THERE'S ALSO. A CHANGE MANAGEMENT SIDE OF IT BUT THE MOST. EXCITING PART OF IT I THINK IS THAT WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE MUCH MORE NIMBLE SO YOU KNOW NEW PROGRAMS LIKE PULL UP THAT CAME INTO PLACE NEW REGULATIONS POLICY CHANGES. WE WILL BE ABLE TO- IMPLEMENT THOSE MUCH MORE QUICKLY SO IN TIMES LIKE WE HAD DURING THE PANDEMIC THAT ASPECT WAS IS REALLY KEY I MEAN THAT WAS. PART OF THE ISSUE TO YOUR POINT THAT YOU MENTION IS THAT WE COULDN'T PROGRAM THINGS SUCH AS QUICKLY AS WE COULD AND THAT'S WE HAD YOU KNOW THE- THE WORD BACKLOG A WE HAD BACKLOG ON. YOU KNOW FOR A FOR A BIT- BEFORE WE COULD ACTUALLY- RUN THROUGH IT SO. THAT IS REALLY GOING TO BE THE- THE MOST- I THINK EXCITING PART ABOUT EDP. JERRY AND I AM THREE FIVE FRAZIER THAT SO THE- THE CONCERN I GUESS IS THAT WE DON'T FIND OURSELVES. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MODERNIZATION PROCESS AND THEN FACING ANOTHER SEARCH SO. YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE KIND OF NOT LATER THAN DATE DID DID WE USE THE LEISURE YOU CAN ASSUME. THAT THIS WORK COULD BE DONE TO AS WE LOOK TOWARD YOU KNOW- AS I THINK SOMEBODY EARLIER. IN THE PRESENTATION MENTIONED YOU YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING ONE TWO YEARS OUT GIVEN SOME OF THE LAGGING INDICATORS AROUND RECESSIONS WE YOU KNOW NOT UNLIKELY WILL HAVE. SOME LEVEL SURGE IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS. SO THAT THE GREAT. A THAT- HAVE SOME JAN TEN. PROPOSALS SO WE HAVE SOME. YOU KNOW CURRENT THEN THAT ARE. FOR ME. THE SPORTS. THAT WE'VE USED OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS- AS WE ROLL INTO EDT NEXT YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE ACCENTURE YOU KNOW TO COMPLETE SOME OF THE CSA RECOMMENDATIONS- YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO HAVE TO CONTINUE TO MODERNIZE AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO MODERNIZE. AT THE SAME TIME WE CALL IT CARILLO MODERNIZATION BECAUSE WE DO NEED TO BE PREPARED TO YOUR POINT. FOR RECESSION OR SOME SORT OF- UNEMPLOYMENT SURGE YOU KNOW IN THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE CSA AND THE STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS- PUT FORTH AND YOU KNOW SOME OF THE VENDORS THAT WE HAVE. THAT THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY USING THAT WE HAVE ASKED FOR- IN JAN TEN WILL LIKELY BE REPLACED OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS WITH EDT NEXT YEAR WE'RE FINISHING UP SOME OF THE CSA RECOMMENDATIONS- AT SOME POINT THOSE THINGS WILL MERGE. AND SO BASICALLY IN A NUTSHELL I GUESS WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT. THE JAN TEN PROPOSALS ARE FOR THE HERE AND NOW. AND THEN EDT NEXT IS THE FUTURE- AND THAT IS A WAY THAT WE CAN- SORT OF MERGE THAT THE TO- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PREPARED- FOR ANY OF RECESSION OR SURGEON UNEMPLOYMENT. CLAIMS NOT A PRIVILEGE FOR TO CONTINUE DISCUSSES. MOVE THANK YOU MISTER GOOD BECAUSE IT- I COUPLE OF THINGS- GOOD TO SEE DIRECTOR FAR- THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR- ON THE EDT NEXT WHAT DO YOU WALL PROJECT TO BE THE- TOTAL AMOUNT. NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT THIS- ONCE IT'S FULLY IMPLEMENTED. ARE THERE ANY POTENTIAL CUSTOM PRESSURES THAT YOU'RE ANTICIPATING. SO YOU KNOW WE PROVIDED SOME OF THIS IN SOME WRITTEN QUESTIONS BUT I'LL JUST START A HIGH LEVEL IT- YOU KNOW IT'S ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION AND ONE TIME COSTS WHICH IS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ROADMAP- THAT YOU DON'T THINK THE LATE LAST YEAR- THE LEGISLATURE- PROVIDED- TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR US TO- BUT- CREATE THE ROADMAP WITH KPMG OVER THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD. AND THEN THE OTHER COSTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS TO SUPPORT EDT AND TO SUPPORT THE NEW PROJECTS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS IS AROUND THREE HUNDRED MILLION- SO DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION AS FAR AS THE POTENTIAL COST PRESSURES I MEAN PART OF THE INVESTMENTS- AS I MENTIONED LAST YEAR WAS THAT THE TWELVE MILLION YOU KNOW. BASICALLY TO RELY ON EXPERTS WHICH WE DID KPMG I'M TO PUT TOGETHER THE ROAD MAP FOR THE PROJECT WHICH OF COURSE INCLUDED COSTING- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE COSTS WERE ESTIMATED TO BE ON THE CONSERVATIVE SIDE THEY ERRED ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION- AND KNOWING BECAUSE THE PROJECT EATING NEXT PROJECT IS GOING TO BE A PHASE PROCESS WE HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY- THEN IF THE PROJECT WAS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL AND HERE IT IS IN FIVE YEARS AND IT'S DONE THIS IS GOING TO BE AN INTERPRETIVE PROCESS- SO WE'LL BE ABLE TO MONITOR EACH OF THE- PROJECTS GOING FORWARD AND OF COURSE. YOU KNOW WE'RE ALWAYS GONNA RELY ON STATE STAFF TO THE FULLEST EXTENT POSSIBLE- AND TRY TO CUT COSTS THAT WAY. GREAT COUPLE MORE OF COURSE. IS. GIVE ME AN IDEA OF WHAT YOU ENVISION IS GOING TO CHANGE FOR THE USERS THEM YEAH I MEAN THAT THAT REALLY IS A GREAT QUESTION AND I WILL STAY YOU KNOW IT'S A FIVE YEAR PROJECT SO I WILL FOCUS ON YOU KNOW THE FIRST YEAR- WE HAVE LOTS OF MILESTONES BUT SOME OF THE ONES THAT I KNOW ARE NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART AND I THINK YOU'RE AS WELL AS- FORMS REDESIGN YOU KNOW THAT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE HEARD A LOT ABOUT DURING THE PANDEMIC. FROM CLAIMANTS IN CONSTITUENTS IN CALIFORNIA'S GENERAL CALIFORNIANS GENERALLY- THE CALL CENTER IMPROVEMENTS I MEAN THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE- ARE WORKING ON NOW- BUT YOU KNOW WE ARE THAT IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA DEFINITELY ROLLING DDT NEXT- JUST MAKING IT EASIER MAKING IT SO- PEOPLE RELY LESS ON THE CALL CENTER STILL BE ONLINE FOR LINKING INSTANCE THAT WE'RE DOING. SO IT'S SORT OF A ONE STOP SHOP FOR PEOPLE OF REGARDLESS OF WHICH- PROGRAM THEIR BENEFITS THEY'RE LOOKING FOR AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA BE TRAINING STAFF ALONG THE WAY- BUT WITH THE WITH ALL THAT BEING SAID- LANGUAGE ACCESS IS STILL A HUGE. DEAL FOR ME- AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON SINCE I STARTED AT EDS I THINK MOST OF YOU KNOW- AND THAT IS ALSO GOING TO- WE ARE EVERYTHING THAT WE ARE DOING FOR CLAIMANTS WE ARE DOING FOR EVERYONE TO MEET EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS REGARDLESS OF. LANGUAGE OR DISABILITY- TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS OUR BENEFITS AND- I THINK THAT'S THAT IS LIKE OUR FIRST YEAR GOAL IT'S A BIG GOAL BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF DEDICATED PEOPLE HERE EDT THAT'S GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS HAPPENS. OKAY AND I'M SORRY IF THIS ALREADY- I'M SURE THIS ALREADY EXISTS BUT TO PROVIDE US YOUR MENTION OF- MILESTONES AND METRICS- I THINK YOU'D BE REALLY GOOD FOR THE LEGISLATURE- A- MAYBE YOU'VE- WE'VE ALL. AGREED THIS A TO THIS BUT IT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO KNOW THIS IS WHAT WE CAN EXPECT THE FIRST YEAR THE SECOND YEAR. AND BY THE END OF THE OF THE FIVE YEARS- BECAUSE I THINK OTHERWISE WE HAVE A SENSE OF. THINGS WORSE. WERE WRONG AND- WHEN AND HOW WE GONNA GET THROUGH THEM AND- I THINK IS STILL ON EVERYBODY'S MINDS. AND SENATOR JUST TO NOT POINT OUT YOU CAN ASK BUT I'M GONNA SAY IT BECAUSE THIS IS A REALLY EXCITING PROJECT BUT- TO THAT POINT YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL- PROJECT RIGHT SO THIS THIS IS GOINGTO BE. AGAIN SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO BE A PART OF EVERY YEAR BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE TO COME BACK TO YOU- YOU WILL SEE MIGHT BREAK SHINING FACE FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. YOU KNOW TO- TO REALLY TALK ABOUT WHAT WE'VE DONE THE FOR THE PREVIOUS YEAR AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO THE NEXT YEAR AND THAT WILL BE YOU KNOW A DECISION THAT WILL BE MADE WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON TO FUND THOSE PROJECTS. GREAT THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT- WITH REGARDS TO- THE FRAUD AND IDENTITY THEFT AWARENESS- I WAS SACKED. CONCERNED ABOUT THE E. D. D.'S ROLE IN FUNDING DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICES- ARE YOU CURRENTLY OF PROVIDING OF FUNDING OF ON THE PROSECUTION OF CRIMINAL FRAUD CASES I DIDN'T EXPECT THIS TO COME UP UNDER ET DE. SO IT IS ACTUALLY A PARTNERSHIP- WITH- WITH- YES- WE DID IT SO EDT DOESN'T DIRECTLY FUNDS- THE DA'S IT ACTUALLY IS AN INTER AGENCY AGREEMENT THAT WE HAVE WITH A WE ASK THIS WAS BACK- IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE I BELIEVE WHEN THE GOVERNOR CREATED- YES HOUSE FORCE. AND FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WAS- BASICALLY GIVEN TO- YES AGAIN WE JUST IN CONJUNCTION WITH YOU NEED TO SUPPORT LOCAL GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS AND PROSECUTION PROSECUTIONS- SO IT'S NOT REALLY- IT DOESN'T COME DIRECTLY FROM EDT THEY HAVE TO APPLY- FOR THE GRANTS OR THE- FOR THE MONEY. THROUGH THE- YES TASK FORCE AND THEREFORE- D. A.'S THAT SIT ON THE TASK FORCE THEIR REGIONAL THE AS AND SO ALL THEIR- ALL THE REGIONAL D. A.'S UNDER THAT UNDER THE- FOR REGIONAL DJS. CAN APPLY- FOR- MONEY FOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR CRIMINAL CASES THAT THEY'RE WORKING ON FOR ANY CASES THAT THEY'RE WORKING ON. OKAY IS THIS MORE TO THAT AND OF WHY AND WHERE WHERE IS THAT. I UNDERSTAND THE BASIC CONNECTION RIGHT TRYING TO GET TO- WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO THESE CASES SINCE ALL THESE CASES AND I UNDERSTAND WORKING TOGETHER BUT- IT'S IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IT'S MORE IT WOULD BE MORE WITH TASK FORCE TYPE OF THING RATHER THAN A DIRECT FUNDING SO MAYBE I'M NOT QUITE UNDERSTANDING. SO THE WAY THAT IT WORKS NOW- AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS IT'S RIEM IT'S A REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM SO THE FUNDING- YOU KNOW THERE'S- THERE WAS FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ORIGINALLY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT ADDS THAT AS- EDT IN OUR FRAUD- SPECIAL COUNSEL- LONG AND I DO MEAN THOMSON REUTERS AND ACCENTURE THEY PUT TOGETHER- DATA AND INFORMATION AND THEN THAT GETS DISPERSED U. F. B. I. THEY ARE WORKING ON THESE CASES THEY GET REIMBURSED AND I THINK THAT THINKING IS THE REIMBURSEMENT RATHER THAN JUST THE GRANT IS THAT SO WE CAN KEEP TRACK OF WHO IS WORKING ON WHAT. AND HOW MUCH IT'S COSTING AND- RATHER THAN JUST. YOU KNOW GIVING OUT MONEY LIKE YOU KNOW A MILLION HERE A MILLION HERE- AND NOT KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT IT'S GOING FOR I GUESS I ASSUME IT'S A WAY FOR US TO KEEP TRACK. OKAY GOT IT ALL RIGHT- AND- JUST MOVING ON TO. THE OTHER LABOR ISSUES- UNDER- THE EXTREME HEAT PROPOSALS. OF THE A. R. AND C. W. D. B- THE METRICS ON THE MILESTONES OF FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT YOU PLAN TO IMPACT BY THESE PROPOSALS. COULD EXPLAIN THAT A BIT MORE. FRIEDMAN CHAIR PATRICK TOPPING DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I AM GOING TO TREAT THE QUESTION OVER TO DEPUTY DIRECTOR PAYING AT THE I. R. OR NEED METRIC ABOUT THAT AND- AT THE HOUR. OKAY THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING YOU HAVE A PEN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS SO ON METRICS AND MILESTONES. ARE USING THESE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES I CAL OSHA ENFORCEMENT. WILL DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT ENHANCED REVIEW PROCESS AND TRACKING SYSTEMS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND COMPOUNDED IMPACTS FROM THE STRATEGIC ENFORCEMENT TARGET OUTREACH RELATED TO HEAT ILLNESS PREVENTION WHAT OUR SMOKE PROTECTION. SAID EXPECTED TRAINING COORDINATE INSPECTORS TO PERFORMANCE TARGETED INSPECTIONS BEFORE AND DURING HIGH RISK- I RISK FOR WORKERS COUPLED WITH OUR REACH ACTIVITIES TO PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS AND INFORMATION TO VULNERABLE WORKERS IN TERMS OF METRICS POLLUTION FORSMAN EXPECTS TO INCREASE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF WORKPLACE INSPECTION BY A HUNDRED FIFTY INSPECTIONS ANNUALLY. AND THOSE ARE PROACTIVE TARGETED DIRECTLY AT HEAT ILLNESS PREVENTION WILDFIRE SMOKE PROTECTION. AN ARMY OUR REACH SIDE AFTER HIRING THE ADDITIONAL STAFF HELLO CHAU PLANS TO PARTICIPATE AT LEAST THIRTY OUTREACH EVENTS AND EACH YEAR WHICH WILL INCLUDE HIGHER RISK VULNERABLE WORKERS ORGANIZED BY WORKER AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS LABOR UNIONS AND CONSULATES. AND EXPECTS TO PROVIDE OUR REGION TRAIN TO AT LEAST SIX HUNDRED WORKERS DIRECTLY ANNUALLY HOW THE METS INCREASED AWARENESS OF WORKPLACE SAFETY AND HEALTH HAZARDS. RIGHT HOW TO EXERCISE THOSE RIGHTS IN ADDITION TO DEVELOPING MORE PUBLICATIONS AND TRAINING VIDEOS AND ADDITIONAL LANGUAGES AND ALSO ACCESSIBLE FOR DIFFERENCE- LITERACY LEVELS AS WELL. OKAY THANK YOU AND- THE LAST ONE IS WITH REGARDS TO THE APPRENTICESHIP- UP PROGRAM- IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE ON NONTRADITIONAL. PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS THAT YOUR VISIONING- AND- A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHO YOU WILL TARGET AS FAR AS BEING THE APPRENTICES WHICH COMMUNITIES. HI THERE- I AM A DAHLE BURNS THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE DIVISION OF APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS AND IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE AND I'M HAPPY TO. SHARE A BIT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHO WE HOPE TO TARGET WITH THIS INVESTMENT SO THE IDEA OF THE PREP OF THE APPRENTICESHIP INNOVATION FUNDING IS TO HELP. NEW ALKA APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS TO SCALE AND TO SERVE MORE EMPLOYERS AND MORE APPRENTICES AND ULTIMATELY TO ADVANCE MORE QUICKLY TOWARDS THE GOAL OF SERVING FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND APPRENTICES BY TWENTY TWENTY NINE SO. I'M JUST TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT WHEN LAUNCHING AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM IT REQUIRES BRINGING A LOT OF DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS TO THE TABLE AND YOU REALLY NEED A CONVENING FORCE TO BRING THEM STAKEHOLDERS TO GATHER SOME OF. THE STAKEHOLDERS OF COURSE INCLUDE EMPLOYERS AND EDUCATORS AND APPRENTICES- AND SOMETIMES ALSO WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARDS OR OTHER COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND THEY ALL NEED TO BE BROUGHT TOGETHER IN ORDER TO. DESIGN REGISTER AND LAUNCH AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM AND- I MEAN ROLE. WE AND APPRENTICESHIP TRYING TO IN. IN CREATING EAGLE OF APPRENTICESHIP INTERMEDIARIES AND ON THAT CA SEASIDE. WHICH IS THAT I'M BUILDING AND FIRE TRADES APPRENTICESHIPS IT'S OFTEN THE UNION THAT PLAYS THIS ROLE- HOWEVER ON THE NONTRADITIONAL APPROACH TO SHIFT. THIS CONVENING ROLE CAN LOOK A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS I'M IT CAN BE A UNION STILL ARM IT COULD ALSO BE A WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD. AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION A NONPROFIT OR EVEN A FOR PROFIT ENTITY LIKE A STAFFING FIRM OR INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. SO WITH THIS APPRENTICESHIP INNOVATION FUNDING WE WANT TO BE CREATING A MORE SUSTAINABLE. AND HOPEFULLY WE WANT TO BE CREATING A WHOLE ECOSYSTEM OF THESE APPRENTICESHIP INTERMEDIARIES SUCH JUST TO. GIVE YOU A FEW MORE SORT OF SECTOR AND CONCRETE EXAMPLES- AS YOU LIKELY KNOW ACT APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS IS REFERRING TO ALL SECTORS THAT ARE. NOT THE BUILDING ON FIRE TRADE SO THAT INCLUDES HEALTHCARE. EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY CYBER SECURITY PROFESSIONAL SERVICES PUBLIC SECTOR TRANSPORTATION I COULD GO ON. BUT BASICALLY IT'S EVERY SECTOR THAT'S NOT THE BUILDING EMPIRE TRADES- AND- SO WE HAVE A LOT OF NASCENT PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT IN THESE DIFFERENT SECTORS SO. TO GIVE A FEW EXAMPLES- LAUNCHES AN APPRENTICESHIP NETWORK IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. AND THEY HAVE OCCUPATIONS IN THE AUTOMOTIVE HEALTHCARE I. T. ADVANCED MANUFACTURIG AND SUPPLY CHAIN EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF A- REGIONAL APPRENTICESHIP INTERMEDIARY- ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND THE SEIU LOCAL ONE THOUSAND HAVE PARTNERED TO PUT TOGETHER A LICENSED VOCATIONAL NURSE TO REGISTERED NURSE. PROGRAM BUT COULD BE A POTENTIAL RECIPIENTS OF THIS FUNDING- OUR PROGRAM IS AMAZING IT HAS 75% WOMEN IN 80% MINORITIES AND- LEADS TO A HUNDRED AND 35% INCREASE IN WAGES OVER THE COURSE OF THE APPRENTICESHIP SO- PRETTY COOL. PROGRAM OTHER EXAMPLES- WISE INDUSTRIES HAS A I'M OUT OF FRESNO ACTUALLY HAS AN APPLICATION DEVELOPER APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM- ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS SAM FOURTEEN COUNTIES- HIGH SCHOOL APPRENTICESHIPS. WHICH IS A POOR EXAMPLE OF A NEW TYPE OF USE APPRENTICESHIP- THEY HAVE A TECHNOLOGY. SUPPORT SPECIAL. PROGRAM THAT. FINALLY IN A TOTALLY DAY SEX- THE FARM HAS AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM FOR FARM AND RANCH MANAGERS SO THIS JUST GIVES YOU SOME IDEAS SOME CONCRETE EXAMPLES OF WHO WOULD BE POTENTIAL RECIPIENTS OF THIS FUNDING THERE ARE ALREADY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN REGISTERED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS FUNDING BUT THE MEAN NUMBER OF APPRENTICES IMAMS IS TWELVE. WHICH BUT THAT SHOULD TELL YOU IS THAT WOULD BE ILLUSTRATED PROOF OF CONCEPT BUT WE REALLY NEED FUNDING TO HELP THESE PROGRAMS FAIL AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE REALLY HEARD FROM THESE PROGRAMS IS THAT HAVING ON GOING FUNDING TO RUN THESE PROGRAMS AND SOMETIMES TO COVER THE TRAINING CLASS IS A REAL CHEAP BARRIER TO SCALING- AND THIS FUNDING IS ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT. CHALLENGE GREAT OKAY WELL- YOU DIDN'T MENTION SPECIFICALLY BUT WOMEN AND YOUTH- I SHOULD DEFINITELY BE A PART OF THE- NONTRADITIONAL SIDE OF WHO GETS TARGETED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE APPRENTICES OF FRIENDSHIPS EVEN WITHIN THE- BUILDING AND FIRE TREATS. SO NONTRADITIONAL IS BOTH THE WORK ON THE CAREER AS WELL AS THE COMMUNITY FROM WHICH WE ARE LOOKING TO RECRUIT- SO WE HAVE ALL OVER SEVERAL YEARS FOR WORKING REALLY HARD TO DEVELOP THE HIGH ROAD PARTNERSHIPS. HI ROAD STANDARDS- BECAUSE WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO LOOK FORWARD TO A CAREER THAT PAYS MORE NOT GET STUCK ON ENOUGH ENTRY LEVEL. AND THEN THAT BECOMES THE JOB THAT YOU GO TO OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO THAT THIS REALLY ENDS UP AS A CAREER IS OF A BIG CONCERN. TO ME I THINK TO MY COLLEAGUES IS HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THE FUNDING PROPOSALS AND THE FUNDING THAT'S GIVEN OUT TO WHEREVER HIS FOR PROFIT. NONPROFIT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE- AT THEIR MEETING A HIGHER STANDARD OFF I'VE BEEN AROUND MANY YEARS WERE ICY AW EMPLOYERS TAKE THE FUNDING- AND THEN JUST GIVE SOMEBODY A JOB FOR SIX MONTHS OR NINE MONTHS- AND THAT'S IT. AND THAT'S CONSIDERED TRAINING- HOW DO YOU MAINTAIN A REAL HIGH ROAD- AND IT JUST IT BECAUSE IT WAS NOT INCLUDED HERE SPECIFICALLY IS THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY SCHOOL MEALS PATHWAY PROGRAM. WHAT IS THE STANDARD THAT YOU USING JUST USING AS THAT AS AN EXAMPLE LISTED HERE HOW ARE YOU MAKING SURE THAT IT'S REALLY LIVING UP TO THIS HIGH ROAD STANDARD. BOTH IN CONTENT OF TRAINING- I DON'T WANT TO YOU THE TERM IMPROPER PRACTICE TO BECOME SO LOOSELY USED THAT ANYBODY COULD SAY WELL HIRED AN APPRENTICE AND THE PRINCE IS BEEN THERE FOR SIX MONTHS AND THEN THEY- FINISH THE JOB AND THEY GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. WE REALLY WANT THIS TO BE MEANINGFUL AS FAR AS REBUILDING. A BIGGER METAL CLASS IN THIS STATE SO WITH THAT- MS BURNS. YEAH THANK YOU FOR A REASON ALL THOSE POINTS I THINK THEY'RE ALL INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND I WILL SAY THAT SO. THE DIVISION OF APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS WHAT WHAT WE DO IS TO OVERSEE THE QUALITY OF PROGRAMS AND SO WE THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT AS THERE IS THIS APPRENTICESHIP MOVEMENTS REALLY HAPPENING NATIONALLY THAT WE ARE MAKING SURE THAT WERE CREATING QUALITY PROGRAMS LIKE YOU TALKED ABOUT AND- AS YOU KNOW AN APPRENTICESHIP AND HUSTLER TWO FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENTS IT HAS THE ON THE JOB LEARNING WHICH IS ABOUT TWO THOUSAND HOURS OF ON THE JOB TIMES ABOUT A YEAR. COMPLEMENTED BY. FORTY FOUR HOURS RELATED AND SUPPLEMENTAL INSTRUCTION RIGHT WHICH IS THE EDUCATION COMPONENT OF THAT EARN AND LEARN. RIGHT AND REALLY I MEAN BY CREATING THIS PATHWAY INTO A CAREER. IT IS YOU KNOW IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY CREATING A MORE EQUITABLE AND ACCESSIBLE ON RAMP. INTO A CAREER AND WE HAD DIAZ IS CERTAINLY CHAIR A LOT ABOUT QUALITY OF. AND AS WE REQUESTED FUNDING TO BE INVESTING IN CREATING NEW PROGRAMS ACROSS ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT SECTORS THAT I ALREADY TALKED ABOUT. WE WANT TO BE MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE CREATING PROGRAMS THAT CREATE THAT ACCESSIBLE ON RAMP. TO WOMEN MINORITIES FOLKS JUSTICE INVOLVED PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND OTHERS BUT BASS. REALLY DEGREE BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT AND SO. IN I MEAN THIS IS WHY I DO THIS WORK I'M REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT CREATING THIS DIFFERENT ON RAMP INTO A CAREER. AND I THINK I. DS WE'RE REALLY WELL POSITIONED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CREATING QUALITY PROGRAMS AND PART OF THAT IS CERTAINLY IN. SO HOW WE STRATEGICALLY INVEST OUR TIME AND ENERGY IN DEVELOPING PROGRAMS I MEAN I GAVE YOU A FEW EXAMPLES OF PROGRAMS- AND- WE WANT TO BE FOCUSING IN AREAS LIKE HEALTHCARE AND PUBLIC SECTOR AND EDUCATION. WHERE WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE- HISTORICALLY MORE WOMEN THAN PEOPLE. OPEN WE'D BE USING THE APPRENTICESHIP MECHANISM TO PROCREATE ON RAMPS BUT ALSO UPSKILLING OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXAMPLE THAT PROGRAM I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT WITH THE L. B. AND ARE IN PROGRAM- THAT'S AN UPSKILLING OPPORTUNITIES SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE ENTRY LEVEL IT'S ALSO SOMETIMES ABOUT. CREATING MOUTHWATERING WITHIN- A CAREER SO I THINK. THAT'S SOMETHING TAT WE'RE DEFINITELY MINDFUL OF AND JUST FINALLY TO COMMENT. ON THAT POPULATIONS THAT WE WANT TO BE HE'S- WERE ALL OVER DOING A LOT OF. AROUND THE I DON'T REACH COME AND WE'RE MAKING SURE THAT CREATING IS PASS FOR THE FOLKS. WE WANT TO BE SERVING THROUGH APPRENTICESHIP- FOR EXAMPLE WE'RE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION TO ELEVATE A PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE FOLKS THAT THEY'RE SERVING- ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS LAST YEAR. SHOT D. A. S. RECEIVED A GRANT FROM A TEN MILLION DOLLAR GRANT FROM DEAL WELL. AND HOW WE CHOSE TO DEPLOY THAT EQUITABLE APPRENTICESHIP BRANDS WAS TO. CREATE A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS TO ENCOURAGE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARDS AND THESE APPRENTICESHIP INTERMEDIARIES TO WORK TOGETHER WE JUST ANNOUNCED ON MAY FOURTH THE RECIPIENT ABOUT SO- WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO MAKING SURE THAT. THOSE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARDS ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS MIX OF NEW APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS SO THAT WE'RE SURE THAT WE'RE MAKING IS OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE. TO THOSE FOLKS THAT REALLY THINK WILL BENEFIT MOST FROM THIS APPRENTICESHIP PATHWAY. I'M SORRY IN JUST THE FINAL- QUESTION ON THIS IS HOW DO YOU- HOW ARE YOU MAKING SURE THAT- THESE RAMPS APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS ARE MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF. OF HIGH ROAD STANDARDS. YEAH I WAS THE BEARS- THERE'S FEW DIFFERENT WAYS I THINK I WOULD LOVE TO COME BACK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE SOME ABOUT WILL COME INTO THE IMPLEMENTATION LIKE THE DETAIL THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FUNDS BUT I THINK ARE REALLY KEY COMPONENT OF UNDERSTANDING THAT FUNDING LANDSCAPE FOR FRIENDSHIPS IS THAT THERE'S START UP FUNDING FOR PROGRAMS AND THEN THERE'S- ON GOING FUNDING AND THERE'S REALLY BEEN A LACK OF THAT THE ON GOING FUNDING TO HELP PROGRAM SCALE. AND ONE WAY TO STRATEGICALLY INVEST IN THESE HIGH ROAD IS IN THE START UP GRANTS WHICH IS WHAT YOU'RE DOING WHEN YOU INVEST IN THAT THE HIGH ROAD TRAINING PARTNER THOSE ARE OFTEN START UP GRANTS THAT GET PROGRAMS GOING AND THEN THE IDEA IS THAT THIS A PARTNERSHIP INNOVATION FUNDING CAN HELP TO TAKE THOSE PROGRAMS AND HELP SCALE THEM. SO IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A VIRTUOUS PARTNERSHIP HERE IN TERMS OF THE FUNDING MECHANISMS THAT WE'RE CREATING- AND SO AND I'D BE HAPPY TO CIRCLE BACK WITH YOU MORE ON THE MECHANICS OF. HOW WE DEPLOY THE F. FUNDING SURE THAT WE HAVE THOSE PRINCIPLES IN MIND. OKAY THAT- THING NEWMAN GEORGIA JUST WANT TO SAY ONE OF CAN MS BURNS SHOULD FOR YOUR- VERY CLEAR BUT ENTHUSIASTIC- SORT OF OVERVIEW AND SERVE DID IS CONTAGIOUS LIKE I SHARE YOUR ENTHUSIASM- THE YOU KNOW THIS IS ONLY AN ISSUE CONCEPT I THINK IT'S AN AWESOME. OPPORTUNITY FOR MAKING SMART INVESTMENTS- KIND OF THE HIGH HIGH ROAD OPPORTUNITIES AS THE CHEERS MATCHES SO TO YOUR POINT IMAGE IT'S REALLY ABOUT AT THE END TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SCALE THE STATION AND THE KEY. IS SCALING IS SOME COMBINATION OF ALIGNMENT YOU KNOW LINE OF EFFORT STRETCH ACROSS ALL THE WORKFORCE INVESTMENT BOARDS ACROSS THE STATE- BUT ALSO SOME CLARITY ON STANDARDS- SO THAT THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE- YOU KNOW PERSPECTIVE WORKERS HAVE THE ASSURANCE THAT AS THEY PURSUE A PARTICULAR PATH THAT THEY'RE GETTING INTO A CAREER THAT HAS. YOU KNOW TRUE CAREER TO THE PROGRESS OPPORTUNITIES SO I WILL I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE CHAIR AND WITH OTHERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE GIVE YOU THE- KIND OF SUPPORT AND INPUT THAT HELPS YOU MOVE FORWARD THANKS. SIR TENZING. YOUR WANTED. YOU KNOW I WANNA SUPPORT THE DISCUSSION CONVERSATION BUT BUT ALSO BY SAYING- YOU KNOW I DO THINK THE NONTRADITIONAL- FINANCING MECHANISMS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT CAN BE REALLY USEFUL IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA THEY DON'T WORK EVERYWHERE BUT- YOU KNOW I KNOW. BACK INTO THE CAR COUNTY FEW YEARS AGO WE WERE APPROACH TO DO SOMETHING PEOPLE MORE THAN CALLING SOCIAL IMPACT BONDS WHICH REALLY AREN'T BONDS AT ALL BUT THEY'RE BASICALLY- MECHANISMS TO GET PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR DOLLARS AND SOMETIMES PHILANTHROPIC DOLLARS- PAID OUT. FOR PROGRAMS LIKE HOUSING THE IN HOUSE TOWARDS CERTAIN MENTAL HEALTH POPULATIONS WITH APPRENTICESHIP WORK IS THAT IT HAS TO BE A PRINCE'S RECEIPT- WERE RETAINED AND- IN RESEARCH BENCHMARKS THAT THE DOORS WOULD BE ROLLED OUT ALMOST LIKE IF YOU WERE PAYING OUT A CONSTRUCTION LOAN YOU PAY FOR THE FOUNDATION THEN YOU PAY FOR. THE PLUMBING AND THEN YOU PAY FOR THE ROOF TO PUT ON- HERE AND- FIND I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S WHERE THIS DISCUSSION WAS GOING BUT- YOU KNOW IT. IT WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT WAY MADAM CHAIR TO START TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE THAT YOU ARTICULATED SO WELL WHICH IS YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO JUST GO OUT AND TRY AND THEN COME BACK AFTER NINETY DAYS OR HUNDRED OR YEAR OR WORSE THREE YEARS AND SAY WE TRIED REALLY HARD. OF FOR TWO YEARS BUT WE DIDN'T PUT MUCH OF A DENT IN THE PROBLEM. AS OPPOSED TO THIS YOU KNOW IT'S ALMOST A PRIVATE SECTOR MODEL BUT IT WORKS YOU KNOW TO SAY- WE WANT TO PAY- FOR SUCCESS WE WANT TO PAY AS WE SEE- SUCCESS IN IN THAT'S NOT MERIT PAY THAT'S A COMPLETE EVERYTHING THIS IS WHERE. YOU KNOW PEOPLE- ESSENTIALLY GET THE DRAW DOWN ON FUNDS AS IS DEMONSTRATED- YOU KNOW BENCHMARKS IN RETENTION SO- YOU'LL PLEASE GO TO THE CURRENT OF IDEAS PARTICULARY THE- CONSIDERING. THANK YOU THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU- EVERYONE- THANK YOU MS BURNS PRE SHADED ARE MOVING ON TO ISSUE TOO THIS IS OVERVIEW OF THE GOVERNORS MAY REVISION PROPOSALS AND PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT AND RETIREMENT AND THIS WILL GIVE A PRESENTATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

SO WE ARE HERE TODAY BECAUSE CITY ARE IF YOU NEED YOUR HELP IN YOUR SPORT BLUE- RESOLVE THIS SICK GRONIK ONGOING PROBLEM WITH THE HIGH BEGIN SEATED OF CIVIL SERVICE PSYCHIATRIST IN THE C. D. C. R. SYSTEM. AND BECAUSE OF THIS THIS HEIDI AT ALL TIME HIGHS AGAIN SEATED IS IT. IMPACTING OUR PATIENTS IN MENTAL HEALTH CARE BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO GET THE ALERT AND QUALITY CARE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO GET BUSY BECAUSE OF THE VACANCY AT HIGH LOAD OFF CASES. AB FOUR DOCTORS YOU KNOW. ANDREA SO THAT'S THE REASON WE ARE HERE TO ASK YOUR HELP YOU KNOW SO THAT THEY DON'T REASONS FOR THIS IT- HIGHLIGHTED TO OFFER BEGINS OF CIVIL SERVICE PSYCHIATRIST TO- THE STATE IS IN ACTUALLY AND IN A- I WOULD SAY IT COULD. RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION CRISIS THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO INCLUDE IT IN THE CIVIL SERVICE PSYCHIATRIST. AND IT THERE ARE A FEW REASONS NUMBER ONE IS THERE TO. THE CIVIL SERVICE I GOT TO SELL IT IS NOT COMPETITIVE WITH THE COMMUNITY. IT IS THE BELOW THE CURRENT MARKET. AND NUMBER TWO IS THERE IS NO- CONSIDERATION THERE IS NO COMPENSATION FOR THE BOARD AND DANGEROUS WORKING ENVIRONMENT AND CONDITION IN THE PRISON HOSPITALS. BECAUSE WE ARE ALL SUBJECTED TO A YOU KNOW LIKE WHY LANCE WE CAN BE CARED ANY MINUTE JOURNAL. AND IT IS SO THAT IS NOT CONSIDERED PART OF OUR SALARY. AND IT IT'S HURTING IS BECAUSE OF THIS HIGH YOU TO VACANCY. STATE TO- TRY TO USE THE CONTRACTOR JUSTER PSYCHIATRIST TO FILL THE VACANCIES TEMPORARILY TECHNICALLY THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE LOCKED UP- SOLUTION FOR THIS HIGH VACANCY SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE TO YOU. MENTAL HEALTH PATIENTS HERE AND THESE PATIENTS ARE LIKE SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL THAT HE- EXTREMELY VULNERABLE PATIENT POPULATION. IN CONSIDER TO THE SYSTEM YOU KNOW. AND HOW ABOUT YOU COULD IT UP SO WE CAN LIST OKAY. SEEMS LIKE THAT THAT IS BEING JUNE LIKE AS IF YOU KNOW LIKE PRIMARY MEANS OF FEEL THE VACANCIES STIRRED BY YOUR NOSE WE HAVE THE LIKE I. AWSKI THAT. YOU KNOW RAISING OURSELVES TO MAKE IT COMPETITIVE WITH THE COMMUNITY AT LEAST 25% AND OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE PREACHING TO. NEXT PLEASE. HI GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S NOT VERY FUN I AM A PSYCHIATRIST WITH CITY C. R. I STARTED OUT IN CITIES HERE IN TWENTY ELEVEN AS A CONTRACTOR- AND I'M HERE TO ADVOCATE FOR COMPETITIVE SALARIES FOR CIVIL SERVICE THAT CATCHES- I JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT YOU KNOW I MENTIONED I STARTED OUT AS A CONTRACTOR CONTRACT ASAP PLEASE SINCE I WAS A CONTRACTOR HAVE GONE UP. OVER CIVIL SERVICE SALARIES HAVE NOT AND CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES ACTUALLY MAKING INCLUDING THEIR BENEFITS A LOT LESS THAN WHAT CONTRACTORS ARE MAKING RIGHT NOW- CONTRACTORS CANNOT PROVIDE THE SAME CARE OF CIVIL SERVANTS THEY COME AND GO AS EARLY TO GO UP AND DOWN AND THERE'S NO CONTINUITY OF CARE PROVIDED BY CONTRACTORS IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN FEDERAL JUDGE MILLER- ACCURATELY CAPTURED THE OTHER REASON WE CANNOT RECRUIT OR RETAIN AT ARE CUT IN SALARIES. TO DESCRIBE CDCR- ON IN. DESPITE WORKPLACE THAT DOES NOT VALUE THE ESSENTIAL TREATMENT PERSPECTIVES I THINK I JUST HAVE TO ORDER. AND CREATES AN ATMOSPHERE WHERE MORAL IS LOW. THE DEFINITION OF INSANITY IS DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER ANY AGAIN AND EXPECTING A DIFFERENT RESULT. NOTHING CAN REPLACE THE DIRECT PATIENT CARE PROVIDED BY CIVIL SERVANTS A. K. PSYCHIATRIST. IN CDCR- MORE MONEY NEEDS TO GO TO OR TO DISCUSS THE CATCHES PACE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS G. THAT HAD BEEN ON THE PSYCHIATRISTS CURRENTLY WORKING IN CSP SARCASM IN AND DIVISION OF CDCR. I HAVE WORKED SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN BOTH AS A CONTRACTOR AND A CIVIL SERVANT- AND I DID ALSO MAKE IT SHORT ATTEMPTING TWENTY EIGHT. AND TWENTY TWO RETIRED UNFORTUNATELY THAT WAS NOT SUSTAINABLE. WITH THE EARS I HAD OVER TWELVE YEARS- I HAVE- WORKED BONE ALMOST HALF OF THE TIME AS A CONTRACTOR VERSUS CIVIL SERVANTS SO I'M- THE PERSON TO ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE THEM THE NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF THE CONTRACT SYSTEM. SAID THE MANAGEMENT SOLUTION CURRENTLY NEITHER MANAGES THEIR OWN PSYCHIATRIST NOR PROVIDE ANY LONG TERM SOLUTION FOR PSYCHIATRIC SHORTAGE. RIGHT NOW SEE ABSOLUTELY CITIES THE ARTISAN HUGE CRISIS WHAT IS THE LACK OF ADEQUATE SELECTIVE STOPS AND THE SEVERITY OF MENTAL ILLNESS GIVEN THE FACT THAT THERE IS A HUGE. PREVALENCE OF ACTIVE SUBSTANCE USE IN PRISON- IT'S LIKE THE SEVERITY OF MANAGEMENT'S. VERY VERY COMPLEX MYSELF I'M TO PUT BUSH CERTIFIED HOWEVER AND THE AVERAGE JOE. SAIKAI ISSUES WHOSE- HIRED BY MANAGEMENT SOLUTION THE SELDOM HAS THE TRAINING THAT'S EVEN AN AVERAGE PSYCHIATRIST HOTTEST AND OVERALL THEY ARE VERY UNFAIR SYSTEM QUITE FRANKLY A GOOD PORTION OF EVEN THE CONTRACTORS PSYCHOLOGIST GOES FOR MANAGEMENT SOLUTION THEIR OWN SALARIES AND THEY DO NOT PROVIDE IF IT UP PLEASE YES AND THEY DO NOT PROVIDE SUPERVISION I DECIDE. TRAINING THAT PSYCHIATRISTS NEED TO DEAL WITH THIS VIOLENCE INMATES THAT THEY ARE AT RISK OF GETTING HOSTAGE WITHOUT ANY TRAINING THAT'S PROVIDED TO THEM THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF YOU COULD PLEASE- TRY TO KEEP YOUR REMARKS CLOSE OF SHORTER SURE OTHERS THANK YOU SO MUCH GO AHEAD SIR OKAY I'M- A METABOLIC COMMA DOCTOR AT THE CITY OF STOCKTON AND I'M A PSYCHIATRIST AND I'M GOING TO REPEAT ON THE POINTS THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY MADE AND- THE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION IS A CRISIS SITUATION. A STATE PSYCHIATRIST IS INVESTED IN THE PLACE WHERE HE WORKS HE UNDERSTANDS THE CDC ARE YOU UNDERSTAND THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES OF WORKING IN THE C. D. C. R. TO POLITICAL IT MAKES SENSE TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN A CIVIL- SACRAMENTO PSYCHIATRIST BECAUSE THEY ARE URBAN PROVIDE LONG TERM CARE TO THESE PATIENTS- BECAUSE THEY WILL MAKE SURE THAT THE PATIENTS GET BETTER AND THEN TRANSFERRED LOWER LEVEL OF CARE. SO CLINICALLY IT MAKES SENSE FINANCIALLY ALSO IT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE THEY CAN BE HARD AT A LOWER PRICE COMPARED TO THE CONTACTS PSYCHIATRIST WILL MAKE MORE THAN DOUBLE THE STATE. EMPLOYEES- SO WHEN I DO SIXTY AGO DOES SALARY WAS. A BATCH SINCE THEN WE HAVE SEEN THE SELLER THAT NOT PACE WITH THE MARKET RATES ARE OVER THE COUNTER- PSYCHIATRIST. THANK YOU THOSE ARE NOT THOSE OF BROWN'S AMOUNT OF HIGHLY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. NEXT PLEASE CAN MEN CHAIR FOR LETTING ME SPEAK I'M DOCTOR SHERMAN PSYCHIATRISTS FROM CSC OF STOCKTON AS WELL I WANT TO FOCUS ON THE PATIENT CARE ISSUES WE HAVE VERY HIGH BUT CONCEDED FOR A LONG TIME WE ARE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF CARE TREATING THE MOST SICKEST PATIENTS WHO ARE VERY VIOLENT PSYCHOTIC SUICIDAL AND GAVE YOU TO SAVE. NEW TO THEIR MENTAL ILLNESS STATE IS PAYING- DOUBLE THE CONTRACT IS NOT HELPING WITH THE ISSUE BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF CONTINUITY OF CARE AND AS A FEW OF MY COLLEAGUES I'VE ALREADY MENTIONED- THE THEY ARE FLOATING THERE. IS YOU KNOW THEY COME AND GO- THE PATIENTS HAVE DIFFICULTY TRUSTING THEM. BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST FILLING THE GAPS- THERE IS A STATE PSYCHIATRIST ON INVESTED IN TAKING CARE OF THESE PATIENTS. THE PENSION PLAN FOR THE STATE'S PSYCHIATRIST IS ALSO OF EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING- NOT ATTRACTIVE AT ALL FOR THE NEW INCOMING- PSYCHIATRIST. WHEN THEY EXCEED THE COMPARISON BETWEEN HOW MUCH THEY'RE PAID AT SIX STATES THAT CHARACTERS AT ONE THIRTY FOUR DOLLARS COMPARED TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS- AS A CONTRACT PSYCHIATRIST. THANK YOU SIR IF YOU COULD WRAP UP YES THE ONLY TO SOLUTION WOULD BE TWO LINES- BEING THE SIX STATES THAT CARD IS TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. MORE WHICH WILL BE COMPATIBLE TO A COMMUNITY STANDARDS WILL ALLOW COMPENSATED THE STATE'S ICARDI'S WORKING IN THESE DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENTS TAKING CARE OF MOST SICKEST PATIENT ANDINTIMIDATION OF THE PEPPER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU APPRECIATE YOU COMING.

ABOUT THE INITIAL STAGES AND WHAT THE WHERE THE BEDS ARE IS ONE ASPECT OF THAT WITHIN A VERY SIGNIFICANT OUT. HIS WHERE IS THE- HOUSING WHERE'S THE FUNDING AND HOW ARE WE GOING TO HOUSE PEOPLE. HE'S GOING TO BE THROUGH RENTAL SUBSIDIES ARE WE GONNA PROVIDE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. AND IS THE FUNDING IN THE BUDGET AND IS GOING TO BE COMMITTED FOR THE LONG TERM. MANY OF THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO NEED HELP. NOT FOR TWENTY SIX MONTHS OR ONE YEAR. THEY'RE GONNA NEED IT FOR. ONGOING PERIOD OF TIME. AND WE IS A STATE MUST FINALLY COMMIT OUR- LIVES.
