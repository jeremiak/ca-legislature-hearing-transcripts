YOUR BROWN FIRE SEASONS IN THE DEVASTATING FIRES OF RECENT YEARS HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED FOR CLARIFICATIONS TO INCREASE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS REGARDING PROPERTY INSURANCE. SB EIGHT SEVENTY TWO PROVIDES ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATIONS IT PROTECTIONS FOR VICTIMS OF INSURED LOSSES AFTER DECLARE DISASTERS IN SEVERAL IMPORTANT WAYS. FIRST WHAT IS SURE TO HAVE SUFFERED A TOTAL LOSS AFTER DECLARED DISASTER THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE INSURERS. TO MAKE IT IMMEDIATE ADVANCE PAYMENT FOR CONTENTS IN A LD. OF AT LEAST POLICY LIMIT. A AT FOUR MONTHS OF THEIR HOUSING IN A LEAVE WITHOUT SUBMITTING. WAIT THE ITEMIZE- INVENTORY OF ONE'S BELONGINGS THIS SIMPLY MOVES UP PAYMENTS INSURERS WOULD ALREADY BE MAKING IT WOULD NOT LET ME REPEAT THIS WOULD NOT RESULT IN INCREASED PREMIUMS. IT ALSO PROVIDES A SIXTY DAY GRACE PERIOD FOR PREMIUM PAYMENTS IN THE EVENT OF A STATE OF EMERGENCY. IT ALSO CLARIFIES THAT WHEN AN INSURED CHOOSES TO PURCHASE A HOME RATHER THAN REBUILD. THE INSURER CANNOT DEDUCT THE LAND VALUE INCLUDED THE PRICE OF THE NEW HOME FROM THE ABOUT THE PAY THE INSURED. THIS IS NOT AN EXTREMELY COMMON OCCURRENCE SO AGAIN IT WOULD ABSOLUTELY NOT DRIVE PREMIUM COSTS. SOME OF FRAME PARTS OF THIS BILL IS EXPANDING WHAT POLICIES COVERED BUT THIS IS SIMPLY NOT THE CASE. THE CHANGE OF LANGUAGE IN SECTION TWO OH FIVE ONE POINT FIVE REGARDING TIME LIMITS TO COLLECT FULL REPLACEMENT VALUE REVERTS TO THAT SECTION TO PREPAY. TWENTY NINETEEN LANGUAGE TO SAY THAT IT COVERS COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL POLICIES NOT JUST RESIDENTIAL. COVERING BOTH POLICIES IS HOW THE DEPARTMENT IS ALWAYS INTERPRETER. INTERPRETED AND ENFORCED THIS SECTION. THIS IS THE CHANGE IN LANGUAGE IN SECTION TWENTY SIXTY FOR EXAMPLE DISCUSSING NON COMMERCIAL LIVESTOCK IS SIMPLY CLARIFYING WHAT THE POLICY IS A BIG COVERING TO AVOID NEEDLESS VIEW CONFUSION. PROVIDING THESE ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATIONS A PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RELIEF AND SAFEGUARDS TO INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

DEVASTATING WILDFIRES WITH LOSING A HOME OR BEING IN IT UNABLE TO RESIDE IN ONE'S HOME FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. AND SO THIS BILL.

WE CONSISTENTLY COMPRESSOR ABOUT IMPORTANCE OF HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE. BUT THIS BILL WILL. MAKE INSURANCE MORE EXPENSIVE. THEY CANNOT BE THE CASE THAT THIS BILL HELPS CONSUMERS BUT SOMEHOW DOES NOT AFFECT COSTS. BY EXPANDING THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSE RENTS ARE REQUIRED. AND REDUCING THE LEVEL OF SCRUTINY FOR CAN'T CLAIMS. THIS MEASURE WILL INCREASE CLAIMS AND LOSSES WHICH IN TURN FOR MYSELF INSURANCE COSTS WHILE CALIFORNIANS THERE WE ARE. THAT ABSENT DIRECTION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. TO APPROVE ADEQUATE RATE. THAT REFLECT THE NEW COSTS IMPOSED BY THE BILL THEY MAY ALSO EXACERBATE THE HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE AVAILABILITY CHALLENGES.

MISTER MOORE LOCK YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU MADAM HAIR I JUST WANT TO TRY AND RESOLVE THIS DEBATE. SENATOR DODD YOU SAID THIS WOULD NOT RAISE PREMIUMS BUT I'M GETTING ARGUMENTS BACK THAT IT WILL RAISE PREMIUM SO. TO ME GIVE ME A LITTLE TUTORIAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CARE FIRST OF ALL. I FEEL LIKE I'M A VETERAN OF DOING THESE INSURANCE BILLS AS A RESULT OF WILDFIRES I DID IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN LAST YEAR AND HERE AGAIN THIS YEAR AND WHATEVER THERE IS AN INSURANCE BILL THE REASON WHY INSURANCE COMPANIES BUT OPPOSE THESE BILLS SAY IT'S CAN IMPOSE COST- IT'S GOOD OPPOSE COST ON YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND GET. GET THAT LEGISLATORS THE ALL ALL HOT AND BOTHERED ABOUT THAT SIMPLY PUT WE'RE GONNA GO THROUGH THE THREE AGAIN NUMBER ONE. WHAT ENSURE TO SUFFERED A TOTAL LOSS AFTER DECLARED DISASTER. BASICALLY THERE IT WE'RE ASKING THEM TO PAY 25% OF IT IT INSURANCE CAR TAX POLICY LIMIT IT FOR MONTHS BAILEY. THEY'RE GOING TO PAY A 100% OF THAT WE'RE JUST ASKING FOR CASH FLOW FOR THESE VICTIMS THAT HAVE LOST EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING IN THEIR LIFE THEY'VE LOST ALL WE'RE SAYING IS PLEASE FOR THEM THEY'RE GOING TO GET ANYWAY THAT DOES NOT INCREASE COSTS. SECOND THE SIXTY DAY GRACE PERIOD FOR PREMIUM PAYMENT IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY PEOPLE ON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE THEIR CHECK MAYBE THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE A CHECKBOOK ANYMORE. THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE NUMBER OF YOUR ACCOUNTS ARE THEY NEED A GRACE PERIOD- THIS MAY. PRESENT A MINIMAL WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THIS IS JUST NOW. ANYBODY THAT'S A VICTIM OF A THAT. OF A- FIRE THAT IS A FEDERAL AND STATE DECLARED EMERGENCY SO IT'S A FINITE NUMBER OF PEOPLE LET'S JUST SAY IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. THAT WAS LIKE. WHAT TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE PERHAPS THE SIX THREE THOUSAND OVER TWELVE MILLION INSURERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I JUST THINK THAT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY DE MINIMUS. FINALLY THE LAST PROVISION IS WHAT ENSURE CHOOSES TO PURCHASE A HOME RATHER THAN REBUILD. THE INSURER CANNOT DETECT THE LAND VALUE INCLUDED IN THE PRICE HERE'S MY EXAMPLE. LET'S JUST SAY YOU'VE GOT A ONE POINT TWO. MILLION DOLLAR HOUSE. THE REALITY IS. IF YOU REBUILD IT IT IN IT IT'S INSURED THROUGH THE YOU CAN REBUILD THAT HOUSE FOR A MILLION DOLLARS ON LAND VALUE IS TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND THEY'RE GONNA WRITE YOU A CHECK FOR TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO BE. PART OF ME THEY'RE GONNA WRITE YOU A CHECK FOR A MILLION DOLLARS THE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND STAYS THERE BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE LED. TO BUILD YOUR HOUSE ON. BUT IN ANOTHER SIS'S SITUATION BUT SAY THEY DECIDE HEY YOU KNOW WHAT WE- WERE OLDER WE DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH AND REBUILD OUR HOME OR I'M GONNA GO TO AN OLD FOLKS HOME OR- SENIOR CITIZENS THAT'S TERRIBLE THINGS. SEE YOUR BILL THE SINCE SENIOR CITIZEN. CELERY IN IT AND NOT HAVE TO REBUILD MY HOME. WHAT THEY WANT TO DO THAT IS TO WRITE A CHECK FOR A MILLION DOLLARS NOW THEY WANT TO WRITE YOU A CHECK FOR EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND. HOW FAIR IS THAT. SO I'M TELLING YOU OF SIX YEAR OLD IN IN TERMS OF THIS PARTICULAR BILL THIS WILL NOT INCREASE COSTS- I AM VERY VERY SENSITIVE TO INCREASE COST PARTICULARLY IN THIS DAY AND AGE RIGHT. NOW WITH THE COVERT SITUATION BUT THAT THIS- I JUST REALLY WHAT WE'RE HEARING. WHAT'S WRONG EVERY IN ALL IT'S TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE. FOR CONSUMERS. THANK YOU ANY OTHER MEMBERS WISHING TO SPEAK. I WILL NOW GIVE US SENATOR BATES THAT WHOSE- THE CITY REMOTELY AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ARE WELCOME SENATOR BATES YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN MAKE SURE I'M DOING THIS THING RIGHT TIME I THINK THE AFFORDABILITY ISSUE CONTINUES TO BE VERY PERPLEXING WHEN WE HEAR ENATOR DODD I SAY IT IS NOT HAPPY AWESOME INSURANCE AND WANT TO BELIEVE THAT HOWEVER OP MY DISTRICT HAS SOME VERY HIGH RISK FIRE AREAS AND IN FACT THE PREMIUMS HAVE GONE UP. SO I THINK IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO HEAR FROM MR MARTINO IF THEY HAVE DONE ANY SORT OF COST IN OUR SCHOOLS AND MAY THAT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE ASK FOR SO WE DON'T EACH. REALLY THE ISSUE I USED THE BILL I AND WE'RE ALL VERY KIND. ESPECIALLY IF THEY DON SAID THE BOB AND THE A- THAT CAR STAR. COSTS THIRTY WILL UP A LOT OF WITH INSURANCE AND- IN MY DISTRICT. WHERE PEOPLE OF HAD TO SEEK YOU KNOW AD SOME YOU KNOW VERY VERY DIFFICULT TIME OTHER INSURANCE. BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN DISCONTINUED OR THE COSTS AS BEEN PRO CANADA. BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND THAT THE BIG WILD FIRE SEASON SO. WITHOUT MISTER MARTINEZ IF YOU WOULD. HAVE YOU DONE AN ANALYSIS WHAT DO YOU DO AN ANALYSIS ON THE COST IMPACTS WHEN WE EXPAND- CLAIMS OF LOS EXPERIENCES OR EXPENSES AND IF NOT- AND CHEER I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD CONSIDER GOING FORWARD. THAT WE DO ASK FOR PREMIUM IMPACTS THE MATCH AN ANALYSIS ON ALTHOUGH THE BILLS THAT ARE SPONSORED BY CD I THAT IS SO SIMPLY I THINK SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE PART OF- WHAT WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE DETERMINING SUPPORT. FOR THESE BILLS WHICH HEY I AM TOTALLY THERE ARE FOR THE CONSUMERS THAT WE HAVE TO ASSUME THAT OTHER PEOPLE YOU KNOW ARE ARE BEING SEEING SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED. ON EVERY FRONT SUBTLE WITHOUT TIME BY TO ASK IF YOU WOULD ASK MISTER MARTINEZ TO GIVE US SOME INSIGHT ON YOUR- WHETHER THERE IS A COST ANALYSIS THAT GOES. ALONG WITH EACH BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES MARCH FOR JULY TO RESPOND TO THAT YES OF COURSE. MICHAEL MARTINEZ DEL APARTMENT INSURANCE THANK YOU SENATOR BATES FOR THAT QUESTION. AND THERE IS A MEMBER WAY TO US TO ANSWER THIS AND THEN A MICRO LET ME. JUST SAY FROM THE MICRO FIRST WITH REGARD TO THIS BILL SENATE BILL EIGHT SEVEN TWO BEFORE THIS BODY. IS THAT ON PAGE SIX OF NINE FOR THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THERE IS A REFERENCE TO THE DEPARTMENT INSURANCE STAFF. PROVIDING A BASIC ASSESSMENT OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT THIS BILL MAY HAVE ON RATES. AND SO I WANTED TO POINT TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO THE SECTION. WHERE BASICALLY IT STATED THAT. MANY OF THE EXPEDITED CLAIMS PROVISIONS IN TIME WOMEN EXPECT EXTENSIONS. SHOULD NOT IMPACT RATES SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE- THEY ONLY PROVIDE WITH INSURED WOULD HAVE RECEIVED ANYWAY. I ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT. PREVIOUSLY THERE ARE SEVERAL COMPONENTS OF THIS BILL. THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS WHEN WE'VE HAD THESE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. HAS EL REACHED TO THROUGH NOTICES TO THE INSURANCE. INDUSTRY IS SAYING HEY CAN YOU EXPEDITE CLAIMS CAN YOU- PROVIDE AN UP FRONT. ON THE A LEE PAYMENT CAN YOU DO AGAIN THE SERIES OF THINGS. WHICH THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WE THANK FOR RISING TO THE OCCASION AND THEY THEY ABIDED BY THAT. AND AGAIN MUST ADMIT AT A- HAD VOLUNTARILY. AND SO THE RISK OF ALL THESE COMPONENTS THAT. AGAIN FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT WE'VE HAD CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. THAT INSURERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE IT TO THEIR POLICY HOLDERS AND WE THINK THAT'S THAT'S AGAIN THAT'S GOOD BUSINESS AND THAT THEY HAVE DONE SO I DID WANT TO DISTANCE A FROM. FOR PROVIDING A BASIC ASSESSMENTTHE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE ONE. AND I'D ALSO SAY IN CLOSING THIS MICRO ASPECT THE SAVINGS FROM EXPERTS CLAIM SETTLEMENT AND LOWER ALIE COSTS RELATED TO THE CLAIM. CAN ACTUALLY OFFSET ANY ADDITIONAL LOSSES. BY BY THIS EXPANSION. THANK YOU MISTER MARTINEZ- AS ANY OTHER MEMBERS WISHING TO SPEAK. UP MISTER GLAZER YOU MAY PROCEED. I THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IS WORKING. I WANT TO REMIND YOU TO SPEAK INTO YOUR MICROPHONE PLEASE THANK YOU I AM SEEKING AND THERE WE GO OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- CERTAINLY THE SENATOR FROM NAPA MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND WHEN THE- POINTS THAT HE MADE ABOUT THE REFORMS IN THE- PROPOSAL. IMPACT ON BECAUSE I WANTED TO GIVE THE- THE OPPONENTS SO ANOTHER CHANCE TO. SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO THE ELEMENTS IN WHICH THE SENATOR HAS AS REYES. AND THE CONCLUSIONS THAT HE HAS REACHED AGAIN. MANY OF THEM SEEM PRETTY REASONABLE. BUT TO ME AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE I I'VE I'VE HEARD UNDERSTAND THEM CORRECTLY FROM ALL SIDES. IS THERE ANY UPON WISHING TO SPEAK AT THIS TIME. ON THAT ISSUE. MODERATOR PLEASE UP PROMPT THE LINE FOR ANYONE WISHING TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. WE DO HAVE. A COMMENT FROM NINE THIRTY THREE PLEASE GO AHEAD. OKAY HALEY YEAH SPEAKERS. SORRY ABOUT THAT YES THIS IS SHERRY CALIF OF PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION AGAIN I JUST I MEAN YOU HAVE TO POINT OUT THE IN CONFLUENCE OF THE NOTION THAT SOMEHOW CONSUMERS ARE GOING TO BENEFIT FROM HAVING THESE ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS YET THERE'S NO FINANCIAL IMPACT IF INSURERS ARE ALREADY DOING ALL THIS AS IS BEING SUGGESTED. AND WHAT IS THE NECESSITY FOR THE BILL. CLEARLY RIGHT NOW BY SAYING THAT PEOPLE ARE YOU'RE HAVING TO DO UP TO THREE YEARS OF LIVING EXPENSES FOR SOMEONE WHO'S ALWAYS NOT EVEN DAMAGED. BECAUSE OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S DAMAGED BECAUSE SAY P. JEANNIE CAN'T GET THEIR POWER LINES BACK UP OR CITY DECIDED TO USE CHEAP PLASTIC PIPES INSTEAD OF STEEL FOR THEIR WATER MAIN. THAT COULD BE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. WITH NO DAMAGE TO THEIR HOME- NOW INSURERS ARE PAYING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A MONTH FOR THEIR LIVING EXPENSES. AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IN THE CATASTROPHE TO BACK THAT YOU TO THAT. THAT COULD BE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A MONTH. ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES SO TO THINK THAT THERE'S NO POTENTIAL IMPACT TO DOING THAT TYPE OF EXPANSION. IT IS- IT'S NOT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE- AGAIN AND AS NOTED WHAT THE LAND VALUE. DEDUCTION ISSUE SOME INSURERS DO THAT NOW SOME DO NOT SO FOR THE ONES WHO DO NOT THAT IS NOW A NEW EXPENSE. AND BY NOT SCRUTINIZING CLEANS EVEN THOUGH WE'RE PRESUMING THAT MUCH OF THESE COSTS LIKE WE WOULD HAVE BEEN PAID FOR NOW SKIPPING AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE PROCESS BY WHICH WE SCRUTINIZE AND ENSURE. THAT THE CLAIMS WERE GETTING A BALLOT IN THE MOTIVATIONS ARE CERTAINLY MERITORIOUS PEOPLE ARE TO DISASTER WE WANT TO SERVE THEM QUICKLY AND INSURERS. WANTED IN THAT. BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO HAVE SOME CHECKS AND- TO DETERMINE OUT YOUR ROBERT YOU'RE GONNA PLEASE. YOU HAVE A FEW MORE SECONDS REV UP YOUR COMMENTS PLEASE. OKAY THANKS THAT'S WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THIS DEBATE- IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY IT WAS SENATOR MITCHELL WHO- MADE A MOTION. TO MOVE THE BILL. ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO SPEAK RESTAURANTS. THANK YOU I'M SURE I'D LIKE TO GET A LITTLE MORE CLARIFICATION FROM THE GENTLEMAN WHO JUST SPOKE. MY QUESTION IS THIS WHAT PERCENTAGE OF YOUR LOSS CLAIMS INVOLVE A PROPERTY OWNER. WHO ELECTS NOT TO REBUILD BUT RATHER TO PURCHASE ANOTHER PROPERTY OR NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING AT ALL WHICH WOULD TRIGGER THE LAND VALUATION. MODERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE PROMPT THE SPEAKER. IF YOU WISH TO COMMENT PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. WE DO HAVE A COMMENT FROM A LINE OF. THIRTY THREE PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU SENATOR I HAVE TO SAY AT THIS AT THIS MOMENT I DO NOT HAVE DATA ON HOW OFTEN THAT HAPPENS- HOPEFULLY IT'S NOT VERY OFTEN. OF COURSE NOW WE'RE SEEING IT MORE AND MORE OFTEN FOR EXAMPLE IN PARADISE. THERE ARE A LOT MORE PEOPLE THAT WANTED TO MOVE AWAY DID NOT USUALLY. I DON'T HAVE I DO NOT HAVE SPECIFIC DATE ON THAT WHICH I THINK GOES BACK TO SENATOR BASIS POINT ABOUT. THE NOTION- REALLY STARTING TO HAVE SOME SORT OF MORE A LIPSTICK ANALYSIS OF THESE BILLS. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S SENATOR DODD NOTED WE DO FREQUENTLY HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. AND FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE. ASSEMBLY BILL YOUR BLOOM TO INCREASE- BUILDING CODE UPGRADE. AND ALL THE STATE IS CUMULATIVE HE REALLY START TO ADD UP. AND THERE'S NO ACCOUNTING BY THE DEPARTMENT THAT SAYS HEY HERE'S AN ANALYSIS WILL CRANK EVEN. IF PANEL OUT THERE SO DON'T TAKE. INSURANCE TREES WORD OR THE- WORD. BUT MAYBE THERE'S AN FOR ANY. LOOK AT WHAT IS THE REALLY THE OVERALL IMPACT TO CONSUMERS. BECAUSE YOU CAN'T KEEP EXPANDING OUR BENEFITS AND THINK THAT THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE A COST IMPACT. BUT WITH REGARDS TO YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION ON LAND VALUE DEDUCTION I DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC STATUTORY ACT YOU. BUT THE- THERE'S A POTENTIAL IMPACT. FROM A. INTEREST PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND ALL THESE LITTLE THINGS CERTAINLY DO START TO ADD UP INTO THE CLAIMS IN LOS HISTORY THAT LEADS INTO PREMIUMS ULTIMATELY. THANK YOU MANAGER JUST TO FOLLOW UP THE MISTER MARTINEZ MISTER MARTINEZ DOES THE DEPARTMENT MAINTAIN THAT DATA. AND MIKE MARTINEZ HERE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE I WOULD ASK KINDLY IF MY COLLEAGUE TWENTY CIGNA REALLY WHO ACTUALLY DOES HANDLE THESE AREAS WITHIN HIS TEAM CAN CUT CAN. RESPOND TO THIS. AND DUE TO OUR TO OUR TIME CONSTRAINTS ALLOW ANOTHER THIRTY SECONDS TO RESPOND WE HAVE ANOTHER COMMITTEE HEARING AFTER THIS. GO AHEAD. OPERATOR I'M SORRY- MODERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE PROP THE SPEAKER. THAT LINE IS OPEN. YES AND THEN SHARED SENATORS THIS IS TONY SECURELY DEPUTY COMMISSIONER FOR CONSUMER SERVICES WE DON'T HAVE DIRECT DATA INDUSTRY WIDE WITH REGARD TO HOW MANY. AND SHE POLICY HOLDERS CHOOSE TO GO AND PURCHASE A NEW HOME RATHER THAN WHERE YOU BILL- WE DO HAVE IT JUST IN THE SMALL UNIVERSE OF THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS THAT WE DO GET- IN THAT UNIVERSE IT'S A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER. BUT IT'S WITHIN THOSE PEOPLE THAT DO NOT DECIDE TO REBUILD THEY DO OBTAIN LESS MONEY THAN HAD THEY WERE BUILT AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW. SB EIGHT SEVENTY FOUR JUST LEVELS THE PLAYING FIELD WITH NO DRUG DETRIMENT TO THE INSURANCE COMPANY FOR SOME REASON BUT WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO UNTIL UNLESS YOU CHOOSE TO THANK YOU. THING AROUND HERE. THANK YOU. NOW WE'RE GONNA GO OVER TO A SENATOR GLAZER. MADAM CHAIR I I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY I APPRECIATE THE- THE GOOD INTENTIONS OF THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS TO- TO DO RIGHT BY A PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HEARD IN THIS FASHION BUT I DO WANT TO RESERVE THE RIGHT TO RE EXAMINE THAT IF I CAN GET CLEAR FACTUAL INFORMATION. FROM THE OPPONENTS ABOUT THE COST IMPACTS DOWN THE GRANTED THERE'S AN ABILITY TO THE RATE PAID FOR RATE PROCESS TO ADD. COST TO BE DA INCORPORATED AND THE RATE INCREASES SO THERE IS A REMEDY THERE. BUT I COULD BEAT BUT BUT I DO THINK CAT AGAIN THE FACTS. ON THE TABLE ABOUT CLEAR COSTS. BASED ON HISTORY WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT. PART OF APPROPRIATE DECISION MAKING AND I WOULD RESERVE THE- ABILITY TO HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW OF THOSE FACTS WERE BROUGHT FORWARD BUT OTHERWISE- AS FOR THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR.
