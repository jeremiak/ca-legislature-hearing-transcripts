THE DISPARITY ISSUE BETWEEN

STATE WE KNOW THIS IS AN ONGOING

00:13:18.097 --> 00:13:19.899
ISSUE AND- AND FRANKLY THE FACT

00:13:19.965 --> 00:13:22.902
THAT- AS A WHOLE THE INDUSTRY IS

00:13:22.968 --> 00:13:25.437
EXEMPT FROM LIABILITY PRIOR TO

00:13:25.504 --> 00:13:26.739
NINETEEN NINETY SIX OWNERSHIP-

00:13:26.805 --> 00:13:28.774
CREATES THIS UNDERLYING DYNAMIC

00:13:28.841 --> 00:13:31.043
WHERE ANYONE WHO'S AND- INCURRED

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:33.279

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:38.450
PUTS A LOT OF FINANCIAL

00:13:38.517 --> 00:13:39.985
RESPONSIBILITY ON ONLY THE

00:13:40.052 --> 00:13:41.620
CURRENT OWNERS AND NOT PREVIOUS

00:13:41.687 --> 00:13:42.855
OPERATORS WHICH IS THE

00:13:42.922 --> 00:13:44.523
UNDERLYING STRUCTURAL PROBLEM

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:45.824
THAT THE HITCH I'M HAVING WITH

00:13:45.891 --> 00:13:50.062
THIS BILL. IS THAT WE SPENT A

00:13:50.129 --> 00:13:52.498
LOT OF TIME WORKING ON THAT AIM

00:13:52.565 --> 00:13:53.799
A. B. TEN FIFTY SAID. FROM IN

00:13:53.866 --> 00:13:54.934
THE LEGISLATURE WE PASSED IN

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.702
RECOGNIZING THIS MAY NOT BE

00:13:56.769 --> 00:13:58.070
ENOUGH FOR THE AUTHOR BUT- WE

00:13:58.137 --> 00:14:00.406
ALLOW FOR THE INSTRUMENTS LIKE

00:14:00.472 --> 00:14:02.107
SAVINGS ACCOUNTS TO BE USED

00:14:02.174 --> 00:14:03.008
TOWARDS THE BONDING

00:14:03.075 --> 00:14:05.110
REQUIREMENTS. BUT NOT IN THE

00:14:05.177 --> 00:14:06.111
STRUCTURE THIS BILL AND THE

00:14:06.178 --> 00:14:08.781
CONCERN IS THAT IF YOU'RE IF

00:14:08.847 --> 00:14:10.549
YOU'RE GOING WELL BY WELL AND

00:14:10.616 --> 00:14:12.551
YOUR YOUR SORT OF BITE AND

00:14:12.618 --> 00:14:14.353
SEGMENTING YOUR FIELD IN YOUR

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.488
OPERATIONS. IF SOMETHING DOES

00:14:16.555 --> 00:14:18.457
HAPPEN ON A EITHER MULTI WILL

00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:20.092
BASIS OR FOR THE ENTIRE FIELD

00:14:20.159 --> 00:14:21.460
THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE

00:14:21.527 --> 00:14:24.296
THE MEANS TO HANDLE- THAT COST

00:14:24.363 --> 00:14:26.632
IT WILL END UP GOING BACK TO THE

00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:28.567
TAXPAYERS- IT WHEN WITH. WHEN

00:14:28.634 --> 00:14:32.705
THE TEN FIFTY SEVEN KICKS IN AND

00:14:32.771 --> 00:14:33.939
WE ARE GONNA START GETTING MORE

00:14:34.006 --> 00:14:35.541
DATA BACKED. BE CURIOUS FROM THE

00:14:35.608 --> 00:14:37.710
OFF. TO ACTUALLY THE SPONSORS OF

00:14:37.776 --> 00:14:39.445
THE TESTIMONY IS WHETHER. WE

00:14:39.511 --> 00:14:42.214
HAVE ANY DAY DATE BACK YET FROM

00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:43.749
THE OPERATOR SIDE WHETHER THOSE

00:14:43.816 --> 00:14:45.551
LIABILITIES OR SORT OF

00:14:45.618 --> 00:14:47.519
OUTWEIGHING THE BONDING CAPACITY

00:14:47.586 --> 00:14:49.855
RIGHT NOW OR THEIR ABILITY TO

00:14:49.922 --> 00:14:52.024
PAY. AND IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT

00:14:52.091 --> 00:14:53.092
IT'S VERY HARD TO MAKE A

00:14:53.158 --> 00:14:54.994
DECISION ON THESE KIND OF REFORM

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:56.228
SO THAT'S WHY I'M I'M NOT

00:14:56.295 --> 00:14:57.363
INCLINED TO SUPPORT THE MEASURE

00:14:57.429 --> 00:14:59.865
AT THIS MOMENT BUT I REALLY

00:14:59.932 --> 00:15:01.300
WOULD INVITE THAT KIND OF INPUT

00:15:01.367 --> 00:15:03.602
BECAUSE- CAPITALIZATION COMPARED

00:15:03.669 --> 00:15:05.671
TO LIABILITY IS AN IMPORTANT.

00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:08.007
DYNAMIC TO GET RIGHT. I GET IN A

00:15:08.073 --> 00:15:09.942
CERTAIN CASE LIKE MR K. WOULD WE

00:15:10.009 --> 00:15:12.111
CAN SORT OF AT MY GRANDMA'S THAT

00:15:12.177 --> 00:15:13.879
BUT AT. WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING

00:15:13.946 --> 00:15:15.381
FOR THE WHOLE THE WHOLE SPACE

00:15:15.447 --> 00:15:16.482
AND WITHOUT THAT INFORMATION

00:15:16.548 --> 00:15:19.585
IT'S- IT'S HARD TO MOVE FOR BUT

00:15:19.652 --> 00:15:22.388
I. I WOULD INVITE YOUR YOUR

00:15:22.454 --> 00:15:22.988
FEEDBACK THEIR- TEST. FOR ON

00:15:23.055 --> 00:15:25.357
THAT. BUT I CAN'T SUPPORT THE

00:15:25.424 --> 00:15:29.628
MEASURE- TODAY- IN THIS FORM BUT

00:15:29.695 --> 00:15:31.964
OTHERS ARE WELCOME TO MAKE

00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:33.065
MOTIONS OR WHATEVER THEY THEY

00:15:33.132 --> 00:15:35.534
MAY WISH- IF YOU WANT IF YOU

00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:37.002
WANT TO ADEQUATE RESPONSE YET

00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:38.203
PLEASE YES IT'S THE CHAIR AND I

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:39.672
HAVE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS

00:15:39.738 --> 00:15:41.907
ABOUT THE DISPARITY. OF THE WAY

00:15:41.974 --> 00:15:43.242
TEN FIFTY SEVEN IST FACTS- THE

00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:44.610
SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS VERSES THE

00:15:44.677 --> 00:15:47.379
LARGE- THE LARGE BUSINESS OWNERS

00:15:47.446 --> 00:15:49.214
IT IS A DISPARITY ISSUE IT'S A

00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:51.350
BLANKET BILL. AT THAT REQUIRE

00:15:51.417 --> 00:15:53.886
SOMEBODY LIKE AN MISTER KAY WHO

00:15:53.952 --> 00:15:55.587
HAS PROBABLY THIRTEEN WELL AS

00:15:55.654 --> 00:15:57.022
IT'S BEEN IN HIS FAMILY FOR FIVE

00:15:57.089 --> 00:15:58.490
THREE. RUNS AND IT'S THERE IT'S

00:15:58.557 --> 00:16:00.059
WHAT THEY PAID TO PUT THEIR KIDS%

00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:01.527
THROUGH COLLEGE IT'S THEIR JOB

00:16:01.593 --> 00:16:03.429
TO HIM AND THE KIDS AND HIS

00:16:03.495 --> 00:16:04.229
FATHER AND HIS GRANDFATHER

00:16:04.296 --> 00:16:06.832
BEFORE HIM WOULD GO OUT AND WORK

00:16:06.899 --> 00:16:07.599
THE WELLS AFTER SCHOOL BEFORE

00:16:07.666 --> 00:16:09.001
SCHOOL. OF FOR THE KIDS AND THAT

00:16:09.068 --> 00:16:10.569
WAS THEIR JOB RIGHT THAT'S HOW

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:12.004
THEY MADE THEIR INCOME THAT'S

00:16:12.071 --> 00:16:13.138
HOW THEY PAID FOR THEIR SMALL

00:16:13.205 --> 00:16:15.007
HOUSE IN TAFT THAT'S HOW IT

00:16:15.074 --> 00:16:16.809
SHOULD INCOME JUST LIKE US.

00:16:16.875 --> 00:16:18.444
THERE'S NO WAY THAT THE SMALL

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:20.212
INDEPENDENT OIL COMPANIES CAN

00:16:20.279 --> 00:16:23.148
BOND FOR THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS

00:16:23.215 --> 00:16:23.982
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE THEY'RE NOT

00:16:24.049 --> 00:16:26.552
WORTH THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN

00:16:26.618 --> 00:16:28.287
THESE BONDS ARE EVEN AVAILABLE

00:16:28.354 --> 00:16:29.955
TO THEM. SO THIS BILL SIMPLY

00:16:30.022 --> 00:16:32.458
ADDS AN AVENUE FOR THEM TO BE

00:16:32.524 --> 00:16:34.393
ABLE TO SAVE MONEY AND AS MR K.

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.862
WOULD SAID IN TWO MONTHS HE HAS

00:16:36.929 --> 00:16:38.964
SAVED ENOUGH MONEY IF CAL JIM

00:16:39.031 --> 00:16:40.499
WOOD AUDIT HIS SAVINGS ACCOUNT

00:16:40.566 --> 00:16:43.669
THAT HE'S ESTABLISHED THE HE CAN

00:16:43.736 --> 00:16:45.137
ABANDON. THAT IS NOT OPERATION.

00:16:45.204 --> 00:16:46.705
THIS IS A FAMILY AND MANY OTHER

00:16:46.772 --> 00:16:47.940
FAMILIES LIKE HIM THAT ARE

00:16:48.006 --> 00:16:50.342
REPRESENTED IN THIS STATE. A TO

00:16:50.409 --> 00:16:52.811
HAVE THESE FAMILIES AND JUST GO

00:16:52.878 --> 00:16:54.146
OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE THERE'S

00:16:54.213 --> 00:16:56.148
NO SURE ISSUED BONDS AVAILABLE

00:16:56.215 --> 00:16:57.449
TO THEM. BECAUSE THE NUMBER WHEN

00:16:57.516 --> 00:16:59.885
THEY CAN'T AFFORD THEM OR NUMBER

00:16:59.952 --> 00:17:01.286
TWO THEY'RE JUST NOT IN THE

00:17:01.353 --> 00:17:02.988
MARKET YOU CAN'T PURCHASE THEM.

00:17:03.055 --> 00:17:04.656
AND IF THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW IF

00:17:04.723 --> 00:17:06.191
YOU GUYS LOOK AT IT THAT. YOU

00:17:06.258 --> 00:17:07.860
CAN BARELY GET A BOND FOR

00:17:07.926 --> 00:17:09.395
MILLION DOLLARS POSSIBLY TWO

00:17:09.461 --> 00:17:10.462
MILLION DOLLARS. BUT YOU HAVE

00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:13.599
TO. IT'S YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS THE

00:17:13.665 --> 00:17:15.200
ISSUE ABOUT THE EQUITY RIGHT

00:17:15.267 --> 00:17:17.069
ABOUT THE BALANCE. AND SOME

00:17:17.136 --> 00:17:18.937
MAJOR CORPORATIONS CAN SIGN A

00:17:19.004 --> 00:17:21.473
LETTER OF CREDIT. AND NEVER EVEN

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:22.374
HAVE TO HAVE A BLIP ON THEIR

00:17:22.441 --> 00:17:24.276
FINANCIAL RAIDERS SCREEN OUT

00:17:24.343 --> 00:17:26.078
ALL. FAMILIES A HUNDRED OR SO

00:17:26.145 --> 00:17:27.813
FAMILIES THAT OPERATE LIKE THE

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.182
K. WOODS DO. THEY HAVE TO HAWK

00:17:30.249 --> 00:17:32.451
THEIR HOME THEIR- EVERYTHING

00:17:32.518 --> 00:17:34.720
DOWN TO THE PAPER TOWELS IN THE

00:17:34.787 --> 00:17:36.522
CUPBOARD TO EVEN ACQUIRE A BOND.

00:17:36.588 --> 00:17:38.424
NOT AVAILABLE THE STATE ACCOUNT.

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:40.559
AS MR MONTAIGNE SAID BECAUSE OF

00:17:40.626 --> 00:17:42.094
THE INSURANCE PURPOSES IN THE

00:17:42.161 --> 00:17:43.495
POLICIES WE PASSED. MISTER CHAIR

00:17:43.562 --> 00:17:46.965
YOU AND I HAVE HAD LENGTHLY

00:17:47.032 --> 00:17:48.100
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE PROBLEM

00:17:48.167 --> 00:17:50.502
THAT WE HAVE AN ORPHAN IN ABOUT

00:17:50.569 --> 00:17:51.336
. UNDERNEATH THE MALLS NEWPORT

00:17:51.403 --> 00:17:53.539
BEACH IN MALIBU ACROSS THE

00:17:53.605 --> 00:17:55.974
STATE. THIS IS A SOLUTION AND

00:17:56.041 --> 00:17:57.976
THE OIL PERSON I REPRESENT 70%

00:17:58.043 --> 00:17:59.778
OF THE STATE'S OIL THIS IS A

00:17:59.845 --> 00:18:02.314
TRUE SOLUTION. TO THE PROBLEM

00:18:02.381 --> 00:18:04.149
THE CALLER ANNA WHO CALLED IN

00:18:04.216 --> 00:18:05.651
OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL SAYS

00:18:05.717 --> 00:18:07.686
THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO OIL IN

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:08.220
CALIFORNIA. WELL I DID A

00:18:08.287 --> 00:18:09.822
PRESENTATION LAST WEEK THAT THAT

00:18:09.888 --> 00:18:11.023
YOU'RE ALLOWED OUT OF THIS

00:18:11.089 --> 00:18:12.357
COMMITTEE FOR FURTHER

00:18:12.424 --> 00:18:14.493
CONVERSATION. CALIFORNIANS USE

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.295
ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION BARRELS

00:18:16.361 --> 00:18:18.063
OF OIL EVERY DAY AND IT'S GOT TO

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:21.733
COME FROM SOME PLACE BECAUSE WE

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.335
HAVE NOT REDUCED OUR PROJECTS

00:18:23.402 --> 00:18:25.471
ARE USE. OR CONSUME. SO WE'RE

00:18:25.537 --> 00:18:26.371
GETTING IT RIGHT NOW BY

00:18:26.438 --> 00:18:27.840
BULLDOZING DOWN THE AMAZON

00:18:27.906 --> 00:18:30.242
RAINFOREST WE ARE GETTING IT

00:18:30.309 --> 00:18:31.777
FROM COUNTRIES THAT ARE HOSTILE

00:18:31.844 --> 00:18:33.612
TO THE LGBT COMMUNITY THEY HANG

00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:36.014
THEM THEY BEAT THEM. WE GET NEW

00:18:36.081 --> 00:18:38.050
OIL FROM SAUDI ARABIA WHERE THEY

00:18:38.116 --> 00:18:40.586
DON'T LET WOMEN VOTE OR WOMEN

00:18:40.652 --> 00:18:42.621
DRIVE. AND WE FIND THAT BECAUSE-

00:18:42.688 --> 00:18:44.857
CONSUMPTION HAS NOT CHANGED SO

00:18:44.923 --> 00:18:46.358
THE IDEA IS TO BRING FORTH GOOD

00:18:46.425 --> 00:18:48.727
SOLUTIONS LIKE THIS ONE AND I

00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:50.762
KNOW YOU DON'T AGREE BUT IT

00:18:50.829 --> 00:18:52.130
REALLY IS. IF YOU WANT TO WORK

00:18:52.197 --> 00:18:53.432
ON A CONVERSATION LET IT OUT OF

00:18:53.499 --> 00:18:55.067
THE- COMMITTEE WILL WORK ON IT.

00:18:55.133 --> 00:18:57.069
I GIVE YOU MY WORD WE'VE BEEN

00:18:57.135 --> 00:18:58.237
WORKING TOGETHER ON THINGS FOR A

00:18:58.303 --> 00:19:00.138
LONG TIME. SO IF THIS COULD GO

00:19:00.205 --> 00:19:02.374
FORWARD M. I APPRECIATE THE

00:19:02.441 --> 00:19:02.908
CHAIR'S COMMENTS ABOUT NOT

00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:05.410
SUPPORTING IT- WE COULD WORK OUT

00:19:05.477 --> 00:19:06.912
A SOLUTION THAT ACTUALLY HELPS

00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:09.014
BENEFIT THE SMALL PRODUCERS.

00:19:09.081 --> 00:19:10.182
DOESN'T FORCE THEM OUT OF

00:19:10.249 --> 00:19:11.817
BUSINESS AND WILL ALSO BRING

00:19:11.884 --> 00:19:14.286
SOME TYPE OF EQUITY WITH TEN

00:19:14.353 --> 00:19:15.821
FIFTY SEVEN WHICH- AGAIN NEEDED

00:19:15.888 --> 00:19:16.989
TO BE ADDRESSED BECAUSE WE DO

00:19:17.055 --> 00:19:18.123
HAVE ORPHANED AND ABANDONED

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:20.192
WELLS THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN CARE

00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:22.060
OF I'M ON YOUR SIDE ON THAT. I

00:19:22.127 --> 00:19:24.162
GET THAT BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE A

00:19:24.229 --> 00:19:25.163
VIABLE SOLUTION AND PUTTING

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:26.565
SMALL INDEPENDENT OPERATORS OUT

00:19:26.632 --> 00:19:27.332
OF BUSINESS. BECAUSE THEY DON'T

00:19:27.399 --> 00:19:28.834
HAVE THE FINANCIAL CAPITAL TO BE

00:19:28.901 --> 00:19:31.770
ABLE TO BOND OR PURCHASE A BOND

00:19:31.837 --> 00:19:34.273
IS NOT A GOOD SOLUTION. THANK

00:19:34.339 --> 00:19:36.808
YOU FOR THAT CENTER. YES THIS

00:19:36.875 --> 00:19:38.744
RESTAURANT JUST TO. AB QUICK

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:41.880
CLARIFICATION- YOU MENTIONED IN

00:19:41.947 --> 00:19:43.181
YOUR COMMENTS THAT YOU WEREN'T

00:19:43.248 --> 00:19:45.517
INCLINED TO SUPPORT IT WHICH I

00:19:45.584 --> 00:19:48.487
UNDERSTAND AND- SO. MAYBE WITH

00:19:48.554 --> 00:19:50.656
THE AUTHORED YOU KNOW

00:19:50.722 --> 00:19:52.224
RECOGNIZING THAT YOU ALL HAVE

00:19:52.291 --> 00:19:55.894
HAD VERY SUBSTANTIAL OF-

00:19:55.961 --> 00:19:56.528
CONVERSATIONS REGARDING MULTIPLE

00:19:56.595 --> 00:19:59.965
THINGS. AND I DON'T MEAN TO PUT

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:02.000
ON THE SPOT BUT IS THERE WILL

00:20:02.067 --> 00:20:03.735
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SAID I'VE GOT

00:20:03.802 --> 00:20:05.837
AN IDEA YOU'RE NOT INCLINED TO

00:20:05.904 --> 00:20:06.505
SUPPORT IT WHAT WHAT- WHAT WOULD

00:20:06.572 --> 00:20:08.173
MAKE ME CENTER I COULD THERE'S A

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.475
DOOR OVER THERE WITH THE DOOR

00:20:10.542 --> 00:20:12.945
OPEN IS THE NINETEEN NINETY SIX-

00:20:13.011 --> 00:20:15.280
LIABILITY WAIVER SO IF. IF THE

00:20:15.347 --> 00:20:18.116
IF LARGE COMPANIES WERE SUBJECT

00:20:18.183 --> 00:20:19.818
TO UNDERLYING OPERATIONALIZE

00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:23.055
ABILITY PARTY NINETY SIX SO THAT

00:20:23.121 --> 00:20:24.389
THEY CAN BACKSTOPS THOSE KIND

00:20:24.456 --> 00:20:25.057
OPERATIONS THEN I THINK IT WOULD

00:20:25.123 --> 00:20:27.559
BE FAIR TO ENDEAVOR INTO THIS

00:20:27.626 --> 00:20:29.027
SORT OF FLEXIBILITY FOR THE

00:20:29.094 --> 00:20:32.397
CURRENT OPERATORS BUT IF THERE'S

00:20:32.464 --> 00:20:34.566
NO BACKSTOP. AND IT'S ALL ON

00:20:34.633 --> 00:20:35.634
TAXPAYERS BEHIND THAT. THAT'S A

00:20:35.701 --> 00:20:37.436
THAT'S WHY CURRENT SO THAT'S SO

00:20:37.502 --> 00:20:38.937
I JUST WANT TO CORRECT THAT YEAR

00:20:39.004 --> 00:20:40.339
IN THE RESPONSE AND THOUGHT NO

00:20:40.405 --> 00:20:42.541
DISRESPECT TO YOU ALL WITH IT'S

00:20:42.608 --> 00:20:44.543
NOT ON TAXPAYERS AND THE

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:46.044
ORPHANED AND ABANDONED WELL FUN

00:20:46.111 --> 00:20:47.646
OTHER THAN WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS

00:20:47.713 --> 00:20:49.014
RECENTLY PUT INTO IT FROM THE

00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:50.048
BUDGET IN THE ACCESS THAT WE

00:20:50.115 --> 00:20:52.451
HAVE IS TAXPAYERS BUT OIL

00:20:52.517 --> 00:20:53.051
COMPANIES ARE TAXPAYERS TOO.

00:20:53.118 --> 00:20:54.453
WHETHER THEY PAY OILED- TAXES

00:20:54.519 --> 00:20:55.988
WITH THE PAY FEES PENALTIES

00:20:56.054 --> 00:20:57.956
EMPLOYEES EMPLOYEES WAGES TAXES

00:20:58.023 --> 00:20:59.257
SO PART OF THAT MANY USERS BUT

00:20:59.324 --> 00:21:01.159
THE MAJORITY OF THE- A MAJORITY

00:21:01.226 --> 00:21:04.029
OF ALL A CAL JIM OPERATIONS ARE

00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:07.265
FUNDED BY. THE END OF IT THE

00:21:07.332 --> 00:21:08.934
PRODUCERS- THE ORGANIZATION

00:21:09.001 --> 00:21:11.036

ABANDONED WELL FUNDS- WHICH IS A

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:19.745
SOLUTION THAT I BROUGHT TO YOU

00:22:13.832 --> 00:22:15.133
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS I THINK

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:15.734
THAT MIGHT BE A PRODUCTIVE WAY

00:22:15.801 --> 00:22:17.769
TO MOVE FORWARD- YOU KNOW ONE

00:22:17.836 --> 00:22:19.204
OTHER THING I'D LIKE TO MAKE A

00:22:19.271 --> 00:22:20.839
COMMENT ON THAT. THE PERSON THAT

00:22:20.906 --> 00:22:22.274
SPOKE IN OPPOSITION I THINK THAT

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:24.943
WAS VERY INSTRUCTIVE FOR ALL OF

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:27.879
CALIFORNIANS TO KNOW THAT THERE

00:22:27.946 --> 00:22:32.617
ARE THERE THERE IS A THERE'S A-

00:22:32.684 --> 00:22:33.852
AS AN INTEREST GROUP IN

00:22:33.919 --> 00:22:35.954
CALIFORNIA I DON'T AND I DON'T

00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:37.989
KNOW THAT LADY WAS FROM OR- IF

00:22:38.056 --> 00:22:39.524
SHE'S EVEN WITH THE GROUP BUT

00:22:39.591 --> 00:22:41.259
THERE'S A- THERE THERE'S A GROUP

00:22:41.326 --> 00:22:43.562
OF. CITIZENS IN IN CALIFORNIA

00:22:43.628 --> 00:22:45.797
THAT BELIEVE THAT WITHOUT. LADY

00:22:45.864 --> 00:22:48.500
SAID THAT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE WHAT

00:22:48.567 --> 00:22:50.135
IN CALIFORNIA. WELL I KNOW THAT

00:22:50.202 --> 00:22:52.471
THE GOVERNOR AND MANY PEOPLE

00:22:52.537 --> 00:22:54.573
WANT TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION.

00:22:54.639 --> 00:22:55.941
YOU KNOW WE KEEP MOVING UP THE

00:22:56.007 --> 00:22:59.177
TIME FRAME FROM TWENTY FORTY TO

00:22:59.244 --> 00:23:00.912
THIRTY FIVE TO THIRTY TO TWENTY

00:23:00.979 --> 00:23:02.848
SEVEN TOTAL YOU KNOW WHATEVER

00:23:02.914 --> 00:23:04.449
IT'S GONNA BE. BUT WE'RE NOT

00:23:04.516 --> 00:23:06.184
THERE YET AND I THINK WE HAVE TO

00:23:06.251 --> 00:23:06.852
BE. REASONABLE PEOPLE HERE ON

00:23:06.918 --> 00:23:08.887
THE DÍAS TO RECOGNIZE THAT

00:23:08.954 --> 00:23:11.089
WORLD. A LONG WAYS IF THE

00:23:11.156 --> 00:23:13.458
ULTIMATE GOAL BY SOME PEOPLE IN

00:23:13.525 --> 00:23:15.594
THE STATE IS TO GET TO ZERO OIL

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:17.596
. WE GOT A LONG WAYS TO GO IF

00:23:17.662 --> 00:23:19.131
THAT'S THE ULTIMATE GOAL AND I'M

00:23:19.197 --> 00:23:21.266
CERTAINLY THAT'S NOT MY GOAL BUT

00:23:21.333 --> 00:23:22.534
IF THAT IS THE GOAL AND THAT'S

00:23:22.601 --> 00:23:24.102
WHERE THE- ALL ASEAN

00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:26.638
CALIFORNIA'S GONNA MOVE. WELL

00:23:26.705 --> 00:23:28.273
WE'RE A LONG WAYS AWAY FROM THAT

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.908
AND SO IN THE MEANTIME WE'VE GOT

00:23:29.975 --> 00:23:31.743
TO COME UP WITH A REASONABLE

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:32.878
SOLUTION SUCH AS WHAT CENTER

00:23:32.944 --> 00:23:34.746
GROVE IS SUGGESTING AND THE

00:23:34.813 --> 00:23:35.947
CONVERSATION THAT YOU'RE HAVING

00:23:36.014 --> 00:23:37.449
CHORE SO I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT

00:23:37.516 --> 00:23:38.917
WE MOVE THE BILL FORWARD THANK

00:23:38.984 --> 00:23:41.620
YOU FOR THE MOTION- SO I BELIEVE

00:23:41.686 --> 00:23:44.122
THE MOTION IS TO PASS- YES. SIR

00:23:44.189 --> 00:23:49.961
LEONARD. THANK YOU MISTER MISTER

00:23:50.028 --> 00:23:52.130
CHAIR I THINK. THE DIFFICULT

00:23:52.197 --> 00:23:54.132
THING HERE IS WE HAVE A BILL

00:23:54.199 --> 00:23:56.701
THAT WAS ENACTED IN TWENTY

00:23:56.768 --> 00:23:57.335
NINETEEN AND THERE'S A QUESTION

00:23:57.402 --> 00:23:59.871
ABOUT WHETHER. IT NEEDS A CHANCE

00:23:59.938 --> 00:24:01.573
TO WORK I THINK THE AUTHOR IS

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.642
SAYING IT DOESN'T WORK. AND IS

00:24:03.708 --> 00:24:08.113
DOING THIS. ALREADY AND WHEN. HE

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.781
NOTWITHSTANDING THE CONVERSATION

00:24:09.848 --> 00:24:11.817
THAT WENT BACK AND FORTH HERE.

00:24:11.883 --> 00:24:13.885
YOU WERE TRYING TO. BOUNCE

00:24:13.952 --> 00:24:16.922
BETWEEN TWO GOALS. THE GOALS OF

00:24:16.988 --> 00:24:18.924
WHAT KEEPS. SMALL INDEPENDENT

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:22.427
PRODUCERS BUT THE GOALS THAT I

00:24:22.494 --> 00:24:23.461
EXPERIENCED AND I HESITATE TO

00:24:23.528 --> 00:24:26.131
MENTION. JOHN BECAUSE IT MAKES.

00:24:26.198 --> 00:24:30.168
SENSE OUR ARMED BUT BUT IN MY

00:24:30.235 --> 00:24:31.903
JOB WE HAD TO DO WITH BILLIONS

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:34.272
DOLLARS OF UNFUNDED ORPHAN WELLS

00:24:34.339 --> 00:24:36.041
AND WAS GOING TO FALL ON THE

00:24:36.107 --> 00:24:38.009
TAXPAYERS AND THAT BILL WAS

00:24:38.076 --> 00:24:40.111
ENACTED SO THAT THAT PRACTICE

00:24:40.178 --> 00:24:44.282
WOULD STOP. A. N. SO V. IT SEEMS

00:24:44.349 --> 00:24:46.351
TO ME THAT THIS MAY BE A PLACE

00:24:46.418 --> 00:24:47.986
TO GO AT SOME POINT BUT IT'S NOT

00:24:48.053 --> 00:24:50.255
TOTALLY RIPE YET. BECAUSE WE

00:24:50.322 --> 00:24:51.990
HAVE TO ALLOW THE OTHER THING I

00:24:52.057 --> 00:24:53.091
WISH THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL WAS

00:24:53.158 --> 00:24:54.926
HERE THERE'S THE SIMULTANEOUS

00:24:54.993 --> 00:24:56.561
HEARING SAID SHE'S NOT HERE I

00:24:56.628 --> 00:24:58.463
THINK SHE COULD OFFER US A

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:00.131
PERSPECTIVE IF YOU WERE SITTING

00:25:00.198 --> 00:25:02.067
HERE AS WELL. AND I WOULD

00:25:02.133 --> 00:25:04.369
ENCOURAGE THE CHAIR AND THE

00:25:04.436 --> 00:25:06.438
AUTHOR TO KEEP. A CONVERSATION

00:25:06.504 --> 00:25:08.073

THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND I JUST

00:25:19.718 --> 00:25:23.622
KNOW. THAT THE AUTHOR DOES BUT-

00:25:23.688 --> 00:25:24.356

00:25:24.422 --> 00:25:25.857

THEN I CAN'T SAY YES TO THAT SIR

00:25:54.386 --> 00:25:56.087

THEY'VE BEEN THERE FOR DECADES

00:57:25.575 --> 00:57:27.710
INDICATES THAT THE BILL INTENDS

CALIFORNIA'S DEFINITELY WORKING

VERY HARD TO MOVE IN A DIFFERENT

01:01:33.556 --> 01:01:36.125
DIRECTION TO. BECOME COMPLETELY-

01:01:36.192 --> 01:01:40.430
LESS RELIANT ON FOSSIL FUELS.

01:01:40.496 --> 01:01:45.701
AND TO CREATE AN ENERGY SOURCE

01:01:45.768 --> 01:01:46.502
THAT IS COMPLETELY SUSTAINABLE I

01:01:46.569 --> 01:01:48.738
THINK THAT'S- A VERY IMPORTANT

01:01:48.805 --> 01:01:50.273
THING THE KID CALIFORNIA NEEDS

01:01:50.339 --> 01:01:52.375
TO DO ONE WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED

01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:54.977
TO THE SENATE. I STARTED SELECT

01:01:55.044 --> 01:01:56.045
COMMITTEE ON ACHIEVING

CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY INDEPENDENCE

01:01:57.847 --> 01:02:00.049
AND THAT'S ALSO A VERY IMPORTANT

01:02:00.116 --> 01:02:03.252
GOAL. THAT CALIFORNIA FIND A WAY

01:02:03.319 --> 01:02:05.188
TO DERIVE ALL ITS ENERGY NEEDS-

01:02:05.254 --> 01:02:07.857
LOCALLY FROM THE STATE. WHATEVER

01:02:07.924 --> 01:02:10.393
OUR ENERGY DEMANDS ARE IF WE

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:12.795
CAN- ARRIVE THEM ENTIRELY FROM

01:02:12.862 --> 01:02:13.996
WITHIN OUR OWN STATE THAT WILL

01:02:14.063 --> 01:02:16.165
HELP TO BUILD. AN ECONOMY THOSE

01:02:16.232 --> 01:02:17.400
ARE THERE ARE SMART WAYS TO

01:02:17.467 --> 01:02:19.535
REINVEST ARKEMA ECONOMY TO BUILD

01:02:19.602 --> 01:02:21.838
WEALTH IN OUR STATE. CALIFORNIA

01:02:21.904 --> 01:02:23.506
HAS BEEN REALLY GOOD ABOUT DOING

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:25.341
THAT THAT'S WHY WE'RE THE FIFTH

01:02:25.408 --> 01:02:27.477
LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD.

01:02:27.543 --> 01:02:28.478
AND WE CAN TAKE WE HAVE TO

01:02:28.544 --> 01:02:30.813

A STRATEGY. FOR POWER IN OUR

01:02:35.351 --> 01:02:37.553
STATE. AND AFFORDABILITY. BUT

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:40.523
ALSO. IN A WAY THAT COMBATS

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:42.792
CLIMATE CHANGE THAT REDUCES OUR

01:02:42.859 --> 01:02:46.195
CARBON FOOTPRINT. AND SO WE HAVE

01:02:46.262 --> 01:02:48.030
TO CONTINUE WORK IN IN THAT IN

01:02:48.097 --> 01:02:49.899
THAT DIRECTION AND THERE IS A

01:02:49.966 --> 01:02:51.601
LOT OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO

01:02:51.667 --> 01:02:53.136
BALANCE RIGHT RESPECT FOR THE

01:02:53.202 --> 01:02:54.103

WEALTH AND BE A PLACE WHERE

01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:06.082
PEOPLE CAN ACHIEVE THE AMERICAN

01:03:06.149 --> 01:03:08.584
DREAM AND THAT'S OFTEN A VERY

01:03:08.651 --> 01:03:10.586
DIFFICULT THING TO DO. ONE OF

01:03:10.653 --> 01:03:11.654
THE INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT OUR

01:03:11.721 --> 01:03:12.922
STATE'S HISTORY. IS THAT

01:03:12.989 --> 01:03:15.291
THROUGHOUT OUR STATE- WHO IS TO

01:03:15.358 --> 01:03:16.993
CALIFORNIA'S FAMOUS FOR HAVING

01:03:17.059 --> 01:03:19.795
PLACES LIKE LA BREA TAR PITS.

01:03:19.862 --> 01:03:23.266
AND FAMOUS FOR REGULAR- THE YOU

KNOW THESE OIL WHAT THEY CALL

01:03:25.401 --> 01:03:27.203
THESE TAR BALLS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:29.205
APPEARING IN CERTAIN PARTS OF

01:03:29.272 --> 01:03:31.274
THE OCEAN NATURALLY FOR

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:32.975
THOUSANDS OF YEARS AND THAT'S

01:03:33.042 --> 01:03:36.112
JUST NATURAL SEEPAGE OF WHAT

01:03:36.179 --> 01:03:38.414
CALIFORNIA'S ALWAYS ALWAYS HAD

01:03:38.481 --> 01:03:40.216
IN ABUNDANCE OF PUT OF OIL.

01:03:40.283 --> 01:03:41.517
BELOW THE GROUND THAT AT SOME

01:03:41.584 --> 01:03:45.087
POINT IN SOME POINTS JUST BEGINS

01:03:45.154 --> 01:03:47.590
TO JUST COME UP NATURALLY AND

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:50.326
NATURALLY CONTAMINATE THE

01:03:50.393 --> 01:03:52.628
ENVIRONMENT. AND IT'S YOU KNOW

01:03:52.695 --> 01:03:54.263
IT'S SOMEHOW OILS ALWAYS BEEN A

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:55.498
SOURCE OF DESTRUCTION BECAUSE

01:03:55.565 --> 01:03:58.000
WHEREVER YOU GO AND THE CARPETS

01:03:58.067 --> 01:03:59.936
YOU HAVE- FOSSILIZED ANIMALS

01:04:00.002 --> 01:04:02.171
SYSTEM FELL INTO THESE TARPS

01:04:02.238 --> 01:04:04.040
THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO AND

01:04:04.106 --> 01:04:06.876
THEY'RE STILL PRESERVE. AND IT'S

01:04:06.943 --> 01:04:08.644
JUST A- PART OF THE REGULAR

01:04:08.711 --> 01:04:09.812
ENVIRONMENT AND YOU KNOW ONE OF

01:04:09.879 --> 01:04:11.347
THE THINGS THAT OIL EXTRACTION

01:04:11.414 --> 01:04:14.884
HAS DONE. IS ACTUALLY REDUCED

01:04:14.951 --> 01:04:17.853
THOSE NATURAL EMISSIONS IN THOSE

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.388
NATURAL SPILLS INTO THE FIREMAN

01:04:19.455 --> 01:04:21.924
BY EXTRACTING OF COURSE. THE I'M

01:04:21.991 --> 01:04:23.693
NOT ARGUING THAT IT'S GOOD FOR

01:04:23.759 --> 01:04:26.429
THE ENVIRONMENT BY NO MEANS AND

01:04:26.495 --> 01:04:28.664
- IN TERMS OF AIR QUALITY WHAT

01:04:28.731 --> 01:04:30.600
IT DOES IT'S VERY DAMAGING. BUT

01:04:30.666 --> 01:04:32.768
IN THE INTERIM CALIFORNIA HAS A

01:04:32.835 --> 01:04:35.438
OIL ADDICTION. AND RIGHT NOW IN

01:04:35.504 --> 01:04:37.006
MY DISTRICT THE COST OF

01:04:37.073 --> 01:04:38.474
PETROLEUM IS THROUGH THE ROOF

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:40.276
THE COST OF GAS IS THROUGH THE

01:04:40.343 --> 01:04:44.247
ROOF- WHERE WERE SEEN THAT IN

01:04:44.313 --> 01:04:44.747
INTERNATIONAL STRUGGLE

01:04:44.814 --> 01:04:46.716
STRUGGLES. THAT THERE ARE

01:04:46.782 --> 01:04:48.517
COUNTRIES THAT WE ARE AS

01:04:48.584 --> 01:04:52.355
TAXPAYERS ARE FUNDING OPPOSITION

01:04:52.421 --> 01:04:53.389
TO IN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

01:04:53.456 --> 01:04:56.826
THAT ARE MAKING IN- ARE ARMING

01:04:56.892 --> 01:05:00.162
THEMSELVES. OR OFTENTIMES

01:05:00.229 --> 01:05:02.565
FUNDING TERROR TERRORISM THROUGH

01:05:02.632 --> 01:05:04.600
WHAT WE PAY FOR AT THE PUMP AND

01:05:04.667 --> 01:05:06.302
I ALWAYS ASK PEOPLE WHERE WOULD

01:05:06.369 --> 01:05:08.437
YOU RATHER SOURCE YOUR PETROLEUM

01:05:08.504 --> 01:05:10.172
CALIFORNIA CREEK CALIFORNIA JOBS

01:05:10.239 --> 01:05:13.476
OR FROM SAUDI ARABIA OR RUSSIA.

01:05:13.542 --> 01:05:15.811
OR OR ARE COUNTRIES THAT ARE

01:05:15.878 --> 01:05:21.684
CONTRIBUTING TO- CONFLICT AND TO

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:23.819
A THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES IN

01:05:23.886 --> 01:05:26.622
ALMOST EVERY TIME PEOPLE SAY

01:05:26.689 --> 01:05:28.057
CALIFORNIA I'D RATHER BUY

01:05:28.124 --> 01:05:31.193
CALIFORNIA OIL IF- IF I'M GONNA

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:32.528
AND I'D RATHER I'D RATHER NOT

01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:35.264
HAVE TO BUY OR- AND I'D RATHER

01:05:35.331 --> 01:05:37.333
PRICES CHEAPER BUT- THAT WOULD

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:40.503
BE MY FIRST CHOICE. AND I THINK

01:05:40.569 --> 01:05:42.805
WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO BALANCE

01:05:42.872 --> 01:05:46.309
THAT DEMAND AS WE TRANSITION OUT

01:05:46.375 --> 01:05:49.545
OF PETROLEUM AS WE MOVE. TO THE

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:52.715
CLEANERS SOURCES WE NEED TO.

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:54.350
CONVINCE CALIFORNIANS THAT WE

01:05:54.417 --> 01:05:56.886
CAN DO IT IN A WAY THAT DOES

01:05:56.952 --> 01:05:57.453
THAT THAT THAT. THEY SHOULD

01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:00.623
SUPPORT. THEY SHOULD SUPPORT

01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:01.324
CLEANING THE ENVIRONMENT IS

01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:03.826
GOING TO CREATE JOBS. AND IT'S

01:06:03.893 --> 01:06:05.728
NOT GONNA AFFECT YOUR POCKETBOOK

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:06.796
TOO MUCH ANNA AND I THINK THIS

01:06:06.862 --> 01:06:08.898
IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

01:06:08.964 --> 01:06:11.200
HAVE TO WORK ON AS A AS A

01:06:11.267 --> 01:06:11.734
LEADERSHIP. TO PUSH THOSE

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:14.136
PROJECTS ARE GET GOING TO GET US

01:06:14.203 --> 01:06:15.571
TO CLEANING THE ENVIRONMENT

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:16.806
REDUCING AIR EMISSIONS BUT AT

01:06:16.872 --> 01:06:19.208
THE SAME TIME NOT. MAKE PEOPLE

01:06:19.275 --> 01:06:20.910
REVOLT AGAINST OUR GOVERNMENT

01:06:20.976 --> 01:06:23.245
AND SAY YOU KNOW I'M NOT GOING

01:06:23.312 --> 01:06:25.481
TO PAY FIVE SIX SEVEN DOLLARS AT

01:06:25.548 --> 01:06:28.984
THE GAS PUMP. AND YOU KNOW WHY.

01:06:29.051 --> 01:06:30.786
I DON'T SUPPORT FRACKING BUT I

01:06:30.853 --> 01:06:32.722
SUPPORT REGULATING IT IF IT'S

01:06:32.788 --> 01:06:34.457
NOT GOING TO HURT THE

01:06:34.523 --> 01:06:35.324
ENVIRONMENT. IF THEY CAN PROVE

01:06:35.391 --> 01:06:37.026
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A

01:06:37.093 --> 01:06:37.927
NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE

01:06:37.993 --> 01:06:40.229
ENVIRONMENT THEY SHOULD DO IT IF

01:06:40.296 --> 01:06:41.697
IT HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE

01:06:41.764 --> 01:06:43.265
WHERE WE SHOULDN'T DO IT. AND IF

01:06:43.332 --> 01:06:45.301
WE CAN EXTRACT OIL WITHOUT

01:06:45.368 --> 01:06:47.303
AFFECTING THE ENVIRONMENT. I

01:06:47.370 --> 01:06:48.871
THINK WE SHOULD DO IT FROM

01:06:48.938 --> 01:06:49.372
CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE THE

01:06:49.438 --> 01:06:51.540
ENVIRONMENT IN THE WORLD IS THE

01:06:51.607 --> 01:06:53.642
ENVIRONMENT AND- AND I THINK IN

01:06:53.709 --> 01:06:55.611
CALIFORNIA WE CAN DO BETTER. AND

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:57.079
I THINK WE YOU KNOW OTHERS A

01:06:57.146 --> 01:06:59.248
REASON WHY OF PETROLEUM IS

01:06:59.315 --> 01:07:00.916
LISTED AS A CAUSE FOR THE

01:07:00.983 --> 01:07:02.084
PENNANT USE BECAUSE IN MANY

01:07:02.151 --> 01:07:04.487
CASES IT'S LOCATED ALONG BECAUSE

01:07:04.553 --> 01:07:06.655
- OR ALONG THE COASTAL ZONE. AND

01:07:06.722 --> 01:07:12.561
YOU CAN'T- YOU KEPT- EXTRACT

01:07:12.628 --> 01:07:15.698
SOMETHING FROM AN AREA. IF YOU

01:07:15.765 --> 01:07:17.600
CAN ENTER THAT AREA AND YOU I

01:07:17.666 --> 01:07:19.602
MEAN IT'S AN ALL RIGHT ALL ALL

01:07:19.668 --> 01:07:21.404
OUT MAN AND THE COASTAL

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:24.373
COMMISSION I WAS ON THE COAST

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:25.241
COMMISSION WHEN WE TOLD THE NAVY

01:07:25.307 --> 01:07:27.309
YOU CAN'T YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO

01:07:27.376 --> 01:07:29.245
DO SOMETHING TO AVOID RUNNING

01:07:29.311 --> 01:07:30.012
OVER WALES AND THEY CHALLENGED

01:07:30.079 --> 01:07:33.082
US. IN IN- IN COURT SAYING YOU

01:07:33.149 --> 01:07:34.917
CANNOT TELL THE MILITARY HOW TO

01:07:34.984 --> 01:07:37.353
PROTECT THE COUNTRY AND CLOSE

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:38.821
THE COMMISSION WON THAT BATTLE.

01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:39.922
I KNOW THE COASTAL COMMISSION

01:07:39.989 --> 01:07:42.258
HAS- AS DOING A PHENOMENAL

01:07:42.324 --> 01:07:43.859
PHENOMENAL JOB OF PROTECTING THE

01:07:43.926 --> 01:07:46.328
COASTLINE. THEY HAVE VERY VERY

01:07:46.395 --> 01:07:48.764
STRICT. RULES IN TERMS F HOW

01:07:48.831 --> 01:07:51.033
WHO CAN- SITE THERE DEVELOP

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:53.235
THEIR WORK THERE IT'S A- YOU

01:07:53.302 --> 01:07:55.971
HAVE TO SHOW OF ALMOST NO.

01:07:56.038 --> 01:07:57.573
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT TO REALLY

01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.842
GET AUTHORIZED. BY THE CLOSE

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:01.277
COMMISSION AND GO GET A COASTAL

01:08:01.343 --> 01:08:02.445
DEVELOPMENT PERMIT IT'S A VERY

01:08:02.511 --> 01:08:03.913
DIFFICULT THING TO DO AND IT'S

01:08:03.979 --> 01:08:06.081
MORE DIFFICULT. TO EXTRACT OIL

01:08:06.148 --> 01:08:07.616
IN THE COASTAL ZONE COLONEL IN

01:08:07.683 --> 01:08:09.785
CALIFORNIA THAN ANY OTHER PLACE.

01:08:09.852 --> 01:08:10.686
THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE COASTAL

01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:13.756
ZONE IN THEIR- AND THEIR

01:08:13.823 --> 01:08:14.790
OBLIGATION TO PROTECT THE

01:08:14.857 --> 01:08:17.693
COASTLINE. AND I THINK IF- THAT

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.595
RESOURCE CAN STILL BE FOUND

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:21.530
FOUND THERE GIVEN WHAT I'VE SEEN

01:08:21.597 --> 01:08:23.199
IN TERMS OF RECENT EVENTS IN THE

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:25.668
WORLD IN THE- IN THE IMPACT ON

01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:27.770
GAS I MEAN THIS THIS BILL. COULD

01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:29.839
HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF

01:08:29.905 --> 01:08:32.208
I KNOW BEFORE. OF WHAT WE'VE

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:34.043
DONE HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE HAS

01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:36.078
HAD AN IMPACT ON GAS PRICES. AND

01:08:36.145 --> 01:08:39.114
IT WENT ANYTHING THAT'S- AFFECT

01:08:39.181 --> 01:08:40.983
A LEGALLY THAT ANY BILL THAT

01:08:41.050 --> 01:08:42.351
PASSES AFFECTS OF SUPPLY AND

01:08:42.418 --> 01:08:44.420
DEMAND HAS HAS A NATURAL EFFECT

01:08:44.487 --> 01:08:47.456
ON. INCREASING COSTS AND I THINK

01:08:47.523 --> 01:08:49.658
RIGHT NOW IS THE WRONG TIME. TO

01:08:49.725 --> 01:08:51.427
LAUNCH THIS CAMPAIGN ESPECIALLY

01:08:51.494 --> 01:08:53.128
WHEN WE ARE EXPERIENCE

01:08:53.195 --> 01:08:55.164
EXPERIENCING THE HIGHEST- OIL

01:08:55.231 --> 01:08:59.068
COSTS. IN IN THE- IN OUR IN OUR

01:08:59.134 --> 01:09:02.037
STATE'S HISTORY. AND I THINK WE

01:09:02.104 --> 01:09:04.106
SHOULD BE SENSITIVE TO THAT. AND

01:09:04.173 --> 01:09:09.078
WORK TO- YOU KNOW. PROVIDE

01:09:09.144 --> 01:09:10.980
PEOPLE WITH THE WITH THE FUEL

01:09:11.046 --> 01:09:13.015
THEY NEED BUT ALSO A MOVE IN A

01:09:13.082 --> 01:09:15.284
DIRECTION WHERE WE CAN WE CAN-

01:09:15.351 --> 01:09:18.954
CONTINUE OUR STATES GAINES ON ON

01:09:19.021 --> 01:09:20.956
IMPROVING AIR QUALITY AND THE

01:09:21.023 --> 01:09:24.026
ENVIRONMENT SO- I THINK THIS IS

01:09:24.093 --> 01:09:26.762
A VERY NOBLE EFFORT AND I THINK

01:09:26.829 --> 01:09:28.764
IT'S IMPORTANT TO AT LEAST DRAW

01:09:28.831 --> 01:09:30.366
ATTENTION TO THIS AND SAY LOOK

01:09:30.432 --> 01:09:32.668
OUR THEIR SHOES WERE WEEKEND

01:09:32.735 --> 01:09:34.870
REGULATE THE OIL INDUSTRY

01:09:34.937 --> 01:09:37.439
BETTER. ALONG THE COASTAL ZONE-

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:38.974
I THINK THERE ARE AND I THINK WE

01:09:39.041 --> 01:09:41.210
SHOULD LOOK AT THOSE BUT ON ALL

01:09:41.277 --> 01:09:43.579
ALL OUT BAN I JUST CAN'T SUPPORT

01:09:43.646 --> 01:09:45.114
I THINK IT. IT'LL PUT- OUR STATE

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:46.916
AT A DISADVANTAGE TO PROVIDE A

01:09:46.982 --> 01:09:49.818
VERY IMPORTANT COMMODITY AT THIS

01:09:49.885 --> 01:09:52.187
TIME. IN HISTORY. ARE FOR THE

01:09:52.254 --> 01:09:54.857
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND I AND I

01:09:54.924 --> 01:09:57.126
I'LL JUST BE LAYING OFF THE BILL

01:09:57.192 --> 01:09:57.993
TODAY. THANK YOU SERVICE SO WE

01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:00.462

ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE- THE

01:10:04.934 --> 01:10:06.902
REMARKS MADE A IN MY CLOTHES. AT

01:10:06.969 --> 01:10:08.804
THIS BILL IS NOT AN ALL OUT BAN

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:11.140
ON OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION IN THE

01:10:11.206 --> 01:10:14.109
COASTAL ZONE- DESPITE- MANY OF

01:10:14.176 --> 01:10:16.178
THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO LIVE NEAR

01:10:16.245 --> 01:10:18.013
THESE SITES IN. AND WISH THAT WE

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:20.382
COULD JUST WAVE THE WAND AND BE

01:10:20.449 --> 01:10:24.753
DONE WITH THIS- THIS KIND OF-

01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:27.256
THIS KIND OF EXTRACTIVE. ECONOMY

01:10:27.323 --> 01:10:28.924
AND SENSITIVE HABITATS THE BILL

01:10:28.991 --> 01:10:31.360
DOESN'T DO THAT- THE BILL

01:10:31.427 --> 01:10:32.895
ACTUALLY SPECIFICALLY LOOK ON

01:10:32.962 --> 01:10:34.563
PAGE FORTY ANALYSIS THE BILL

01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:36.899
AUTHORIZES THE PERMITTING. OF

01:10:36.966 --> 01:10:38.701
NEW WORK EXPANDED OIL AND GAS

01:10:38.767 --> 01:10:42.538
DEVELOPMENT. IF IT IS FOUND TO

01:10:42.605 --> 01:10:43.939
BE CONSISTENT. WITH APPLICABLE

01:10:44.006 --> 01:10:45.841
PROVISIONS OF THE COASTAL ACT

01:10:45.908 --> 01:10:47.476
THE FACT IS UNDER CURRENT LAW.

01:10:47.543 --> 01:10:49.078
OIL AND GAS HAVE BEEN GETTING A

01:10:49.144 --> 01:10:50.879
FREE PASS IN THE COASTAL ZONE.

01:10:50.946 --> 01:10:52.982
THAT INDUSTRIAL USE IN THE

01:10:53.048 --> 01:10:54.083
COASTAL DEPENDENT AREAS THAT

01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:55.918
COASTAL DEPENDENT INDUSTRIES HAS

01:10:55.985 --> 01:10:57.086
TIED THE HANDS OF THE COASTAL

01:10:57.152 --> 01:10:59.488
COMMISSION. AS DECIDED THE

01:10:59.555 --> 01:11:02.825
TWENTY EIGHTEEN EXAMPLE WHERE.

01:11:02.891 --> 01:11:04.259
IT WAS INCONSISTENT THE COASTAL

01:11:04.326 --> 01:11:05.961
ACT. THEY FOUND. A OIL AND GAS

01:11:06.028 --> 01:11:07.029
DRILLING PUZZLE AND YET THEY

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:08.764
COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

01:11:08.831 --> 01:11:09.698
BECAUSE OF THIS LOOPHOLE IN

01:11:09.765 --> 01:11:11.400
CURRENT LAW. SO THIS BILL DOES

01:11:11.467 --> 01:11:13.369
NOT CLOSE THESE FACILITIES IT

01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:16.705
MERELY REQUIRES THEM TO MEET THE-SAME STANDARDS THAT A HOTEL. OR

01:11:16.772 --> 01:11:18.607
HOUSE OR ANY OTHER COASTAL

01:11:18.674 --> 01:11:20.542
DEVELOPMENT WOULD HAVE TO MEET

01:11:20.609 --> 01:11:22.845
AND NOT SOME SPECIAL STANDARD.

01:11:22.911 --> 01:11:24.246
SO WITH THAT YOU KNOW I WOULD

01:11:24.313 --> 01:11:26.181
SAY AT LEAST WE SHOULD HAVE THE

01:11:26.248 --> 01:11:27.383
OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY IN

01:11:27.449 --> 01:11:29.184
CALIFORNIA PLAYING BY THE RULES

01:11:29.251 --> 01:11:30.519
THAT EVERYONE ELSE IS SUBJECT

01:11:30.586 --> 01:11:33.322
TO- ENDS AT BEST. WE SHOULD BE

01:11:33.389 --> 01:11:36.558
LOOKING TOWARDS THE FUTURE- AND

01:11:36.625 --> 01:11:38.594
IN A PLACE THAT WERE NOT RELIANT

01:11:38.661 --> 01:11:41.930
ON THIS KIND OF EXTRACTION. THE

01:11:41.997 --> 01:11:42.965
SUPPOSITION THOUGH THAT THIS

01:11:43.032 --> 01:11:44.933
WOULD SOMEHOW IMPACT ENERGY

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.469
PRICES IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER

01:11:47.536 --> 01:11:49.138
BILL LIES IN UNDERSTANDING OF

01:11:49.204 --> 01:11:52.207
HOW GLOBAL OIL MARKETS WORK. OF

01:11:52.274 --> 01:11:53.776
THE WAR IN RUSSIA IS WHAT'S

01:11:53.842 --> 01:11:56.545
DRIVING WILL PRICE INCREASES IT

01:11:56.612 --> 01:11:58.681
HAS NOTHING TO DO. WITH

01:11:58.747 --> 01:12:01.050
CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL

01:12:01.116 --> 01:12:03.018
REGULATION WHATSOEVER THE IMPACT

01:12:03.085 --> 01:12:05.087
OF THIS PRODUCTION MARKET AND

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:06.588
SPECIFICALLY THESE COASTAL

01:12:06.655 --> 01:12:07.523
DEPENDENT USES WE'RE TALKING

01:12:07.589 --> 01:12:09.825
ABOUT TODAY. DOES NOT AFFECT

01:12:09.892 --> 01:12:12.561
GLOBAL SUPPLY AT A SCALE THAT IS

01:12:12.628 --> 01:12:14.430
ANYWHERE CLOSE TO WHAT WE SEE.

01:12:14.496 --> 01:12:15.597
FROM ALL THE OTHER RESOURCE

01:12:15.664 --> 01:12:17.766
CONFLICTS SO IT'S A VERY EASY

01:12:17.833 --> 01:12:19.201
TARGET RIGHT NOW FOR FOLKS TO

01:12:19.268 --> 01:12:21.203
COME OUT AND SAY. SEE TOO MANY

01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:22.237
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS IN

01:12:22.304 --> 01:12:24.073
CALIFORNIA THAT'S WHY THE PRICES

01:12:24.139 --> 01:12:26.108
ARE SO HIGH. THAT'S NOT WHY WE

01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:26.875
HAVE SIX DOLLAR GAS IN

01:12:26.942 --> 01:12:29.344
CALIFORNIA IT'S BECAUSE WE'RE

01:12:29.411 --> 01:12:30.979
DEPENDENT. ON OPEC AND

01:12:31.046 --> 01:12:33.148
DICTATORS. ALL ACROSS THE WORLD

01:12:33.215 --> 01:12:34.483

NOTHING IN CALIFORNIA CAN SOLVE

01:12:36.118 --> 01:12:37.920
THAT SO I WOULD HOPE THAT WE

01:12:37.986 --> 01:12:40.422

01:37:20.601 --> 01:37:22.203
AND WE HAVE NO COMMENT AT THIS

01:37:22.269 --> 01:37:24.672
TIME OKAY VERY GO BRING BACK TO

01:37:24.738 --> 01:37:27.041
DYSON EARLIER. HE IT I'M GONNA

01:37:27.107 --> 01:37:29.009
MOVE THE BILL IN A IN A MOMENT

01:37:29.076 --> 01:37:30.477
BUT I'D LIKE TO GIVEN THE

01:37:30.544 --> 01:37:32.346
OPENING STATEMENT I'D LIKE TO

01:37:32.413 --> 01:37:34.515
OFFER SOME COMMENTS BECAUSE-

01:37:34.582 --> 01:37:36.016
THIS LEGISLATURE THROUGH

01:37:36.083 --> 01:37:39.253
DIFFERENT BONDS. ASCERTAINED

01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:41.055
BECAUSE MOST OF THE SPENDING ON

01:37:41.121 --> 01:37:42.690
PARKS ACQUISITION WAS GOING TO

01:37:42.756 --> 01:37:44.725
RURAL AREAS AND URBAN AREAS WERE

01:37:44.792 --> 01:37:46.794
BIG TO COLLECTED THAT BILLIONS

01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:48.295
OF DOLLARS HAVE BEEN SPENT ON

01:37:48.362 --> 01:37:50.097
PARKS AND THEY'VE BEEN GUIDED TO

01:37:50.164 --> 01:37:51.699
URBAN AREAS WHETHER IT'S FORMER

01:37:51.765 --> 01:37:53.701
RAIL LINES WHETHER IT'S FORMER

01:37:53.767 --> 01:37:57.004
RIVERS. ARE I MEAN FORMERLY NOT

01:37:57.071 --> 01:37:59.173
DEVELOPED RIVERLANDS LIKE AROUND

01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:01.208
THE L. A. RIVER AND OTHER PLACES

01:38:01.275 --> 01:38:02.409
AND SO THERE'S BEEN BILLIONS OF

01:38:02.476 --> 01:38:05.479
DOLLARS BUT- LEGISLATURE. IN THE

01:38:05.546 --> 01:38:06.814
VARIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS REALLY

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:08.582
DECIDED IT SHOULD BE GUIDED TO

01:38:08.649 --> 01:38:09.783
LOCAL PARKS AND-

01:38:09.850 --> 01:38:11.919
DISPROPORTIONATE NEGLECTED URBAN

01:38:11.986 --> 01:38:14.521
AREAS SHOULD ACTUALLY BE DONE.

01:38:14.588 --> 01:38:15.823
IN THEIR WORST SIGNIFICANT

01:38:15.889 --> 01:38:18.125
REFORMS BUT ONE OF THE GREATEST

01:38:18.192 --> 01:38:19.660
ONCE CAME FROM THE LEGISLATURE

01:38:19.727 --> 01:38:20.461
IN CONCERT WITH THE

01:38:20.527 --> 01:38:22.129
ADMINISTRATION A SIXTY MILLION

01:38:22.196 --> 01:38:24.598
DOLLAR A YEAR CASH. INFUSION

01:38:24.665 --> 01:38:26.500
THROUGH THE OTHER TRANSPORTATION

01:38:26.567 --> 01:38:28.235
BONDWHICH WAS THE LARGEST CASH

01:38:28.302 --> 01:38:31.438
IN FEW CONFUSION TO PARKS IN A

01:38:31.505 --> 01:38:32.439
GENERATION AND THAT HAS LED TO

01:38:32.506 --> 01:38:34.275
FILLING POSITIONS IT IS LEAD TO

01:38:34.341 --> 01:38:36.810
MORE PLANTS IT HAS LED TO THE-

01:38:36.877 --> 01:38:38.379
TO THE- SETTING UP THE DIFFERENT

01:38:38.445 --> 01:38:40.047
ACQUISITIONS IN ADDITION TO

01:38:40.114 --> 01:38:44.518
JUST- YOU COULDN'T PAY. BOB BY

01:38:44.585 --> 01:38:46.687
CREDIT CARD OR PLASTIC AT ANY

01:38:46.754 --> 01:38:48.889
PARK IT THAT'S UP TO OVER A

01:38:48.956 --> 01:38:50.291
HUNDRED YOU COULDN'T BE PROMOTED

01:38:50.357 --> 01:38:51.258
INTO LEADERSHIP AND LOST YOUR

01:38:51.325 --> 01:38:53.193
BATCH LAW ENFORCEMENT WHICH WAS

01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:54.795
REALLY DISADVANTAGING WOMEN AND

01:38:54.862 --> 01:38:56.230
PEOPLE OF COLOR AT THAT WAS

01:38:56.297 --> 01:38:59.333
DRAMATICALLY CHANGED. ARM DOES

01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:00.934
LEGISLATURE DIDN'T ALLOW FOR

01:39:01.001 --> 01:39:02.536
LOCAL PARTNERS FOR PARKS THEY

01:39:02.603 --> 01:39:04.571
HAD TO BE AUTHORIZED AND THERE

01:39:04.638 --> 01:39:06.473
WAS A BILL THAT REALLY ALLOWED-

01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:09.877
MANY MORE AND THE- STATE PARKS

01:39:09.943 --> 01:39:12.012
DIDN'T EVEN ACCOUNT TO BUY

01:39:12.079 --> 01:39:13.981
INDIVIDUAL PARK IF YOU WANT TO

01:39:14.048 --> 01:39:15.516
KNOW HOW TO HELP AN INDIVIDUAL

01:39:15.582 --> 01:39:17.084
PARK YOU COULDN'T DO IT. THEY

01:39:17.151 --> 01:39:18.419
KEPT BY REGION SO THERE WERE

01:39:18.485 --> 01:39:20.721
MASSIVE REFORMS THAT WERE MADE.

01:39:20.788 --> 01:39:22.856
AFTER THAT THAT WERE

01:39:22.923 --> 01:39:27.194
SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT. AND I

01:39:27.261 --> 01:39:28.996
THINK. I'M WAY MEETING AS THE

01:39:29.063 --> 01:39:30.431
AUTHOR IS WITH SOME BAY BREATH

01:39:30.497 --> 01:39:31.465
BECAUSE- THE THIRTY BY THIRTY

01:39:31.532 --> 01:39:33.901
HAS BEEN A VAGUE THING US FOR.

01:39:33.967 --> 01:39:35.469
THE EXECUTIVE ORDER WAS VAGUE

01:39:35.536 --> 01:39:37.905
THE FIRST REPORT WAS VAGUE THERE

01:39:37.971 --> 01:39:39.306
THERE WERE NOT SPECIFICS AND I

01:39:39.373 --> 01:39:40.808
KNOW I OFFERED TO THE

01:39:40.874 --> 01:39:42.343
ADMINISTRATION A LADDER WITH

01:39:42.409 --> 01:39:44.011
EVERY SPECIFIC PROJECT I THINK

01:39:44.078 --> 01:39:45.779
THAT WOULD EXIST IN MY SENATE

01:39:45.846 --> 01:39:47.781
DISTRICT THAT THEY SHOULD BE

01:39:47.848 --> 01:39:50.150
CONSIDERING. THAT INCLUDES

01:39:50.217 --> 01:39:51.685
FOURTEEN THOUSAND ACRES OF LAND

01:39:51.752 --> 01:39:53.387
BY THE DIABLO CANYON NUCLEAR

01:39:53.454 --> 01:39:56.256
PLANT AND MANY PLACES WHERE

01:39:56.323 --> 01:39:57.691
WHERE THIS IS AVAILABLE SO I

01:39:57.758 --> 01:39:59.660
REALLY I LOOK FORWARD TO. TO

01:39:59.727 --> 01:40:01.328
SUPPORTING THIS BILL BECAUSE I

01:40:01.395 --> 01:40:02.896
LOOK FORWARD TO THEM GIVING US

01:40:02.963 --> 01:40:04.665
SOME SPECIFICITY THAT WE CAN

01:40:04.732 --> 01:40:07.835
MOVE ON BOTH BUDGETARY EARLY AND

01:40:07.901 --> 01:40:10.037
WITH THE GUTS OF YOUR BILL WHICH

01:40:10.104 --> 01:40:11.839
WILL COME IN AND IN THAT SPIRIT

01:40:11.905 --> 01:40:13.207
I WOULD MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU

01:40:13.273 --> 01:40:15.042
OKAY THAT'S A MOTOR CENTER

01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:16.377
LITTLETON CENTER HERTZBERG. I

01:40:16.443 --> 01:40:19.413
CAN'T BELIEVE SENATOR LISTENING.

TO THE CBO. THANK YOU. I CAN'T

01:40:21.682 --> 01:40:23.350
PERCENT AROUND SIT NEXT TO THE

FORMER SECRETARY OF RESOURCES.

BACK AND I GOT TO TELL YOU

01:40:40.033 --> 01:40:41.969
THERE'S BEEN A BUNCH OF OTHER

01:40:42.035 --> 01:40:42.970
ENDEAVORS WITH RESPECT TO PARK

01:40:43.036 --> 01:40:44.338
AND THE CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE

01:40:44.405 --> 01:40:46.206
AND WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE WE

01:40:46.273 --> 01:40:47.975
SPENT TIME WITH JORDAN INSTANT

01:40:48.041 --> 01:40:48.976
THE IF THE- AT THE CONSERVANCY

01:40:51.145 --> 01:40:55.983
MONEY ON PARKS THERE. VIA GO

01:40:56.049 --> 01:40:58.352
SECURELY ACT IN OTHERS. BUT WE

01:40:58.419 --> 01:40:59.253

GIVE TRAFFIC TICKETS OUT AT VERY

01:41:01.622 --> 01:41:02.322
EXPENSIVE RATES TO BE ABLE TO

01:41:02.389 --> 01:41:03.891
CREATE OPERATIONAL MONEY. AND SO

01:41:03.957 --> 01:41:06.326
THE WHAT THE GENIUS OF WHAT OUR

01:41:06.393 --> 01:41:06.927
SENDER SECRETARY LATER TALKED

AND WHAT HAPPENS DEPARTMENT. BUT

01:41:12.599 --> 01:41:13.801
THEY WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:41:13.867 --> 01:41:15.569
HOW THEY COULD STILL CREATE.

01:41:15.636 --> 01:41:17.571
LEVELS OF PARKS PARTICULARLY IN

01:41:17.638 --> 01:41:19.306

DURING THOSE YEARS. WAS TRYING

01:41:49.203 --> 01:41:50.237
TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE COULD

I FLY HOME FROM SACRAMENTO I

01:59:31.964 --> 01:59:34.233
OFTEN SIT ON THE SIDE. FACING

01:59:34.300 --> 01:59:36.002
THE SIERRAS HAVE ALWAYS LIKE TO

01:59:36.068 --> 01:59:38.671
SEE THE SNOW PACK AND I WAS LIKE

01:59:38.738 --> 01:59:39.405
TO SEE THE LEVEL OF THE

01:59:39.472 --> 01:59:41.340
RESERVOIRS. ONE THING I I'VE

01:59:41.407 --> 01:59:43.643
NOTICED. IN MY RECENT MOST

01:59:43.709 --> 01:59:46.345
RECENT FLIGHTS DUE TO WILDFIRE.

01:59:46.412 --> 01:59:48.848
A LOT MORE OF THE SIERRA-

01:59:48.915 --> 01:59:50.349
DOESN'T REALLY HAVE TREES TO

01:59:50.416 --> 01:59:53.119
PROVIDE SHADE. THAT WILL PROVIDE

01:59:53.185 --> 01:59:54.687
AT LEAST SOME PROTECTION TO THE

01:59:54.754 --> 01:59:57.123
SNOW SLICK LAST LONGER IN THE

01:59:57.189 --> 01:59:58.824
YEAR. AND THERE ARE ENORMOUS

01:59:58.891 --> 02:00:00.459
SWATHS OF MOUNTAINSIDE THEY'RE

02:00:00.526 --> 02:00:03.696
NOT EXPOSED. AND WE CAN EXPECT

02:00:03.763 --> 02:00:05.531
THAT A LOT OF THAT THAT WATER IS

02:00:05.598 --> 02:00:07.099
GOING TO COME DOWN THE MOUNTAIN

02:00:07.166 --> 02:00:10.169
A LOT SOONER. THAN NORMAL AND

02:00:10.236 --> 02:00:13.039
OFTEN TIMES WHEN IT'S NOT NEEDED

02:00:13.105 --> 02:00:15.007
BAND AND ADVOCATE COULD BE

02:00:15.074 --> 02:00:18.811
POTENTIALLY LOST- TO- FIRST FOR

02:00:18.878 --> 02:00:21.314
THE BENEFITS OF AGRICULTURAL AND

02:00:21.380 --> 02:00:23.316
HUMAN USE AND THAT IS SOMETHING

02:00:23.382 --> 02:00:25.051
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO REALLY TAKE

02:00:25.117 --> 02:00:27.653
A- ANOTHER LOOK AT I HOPE. THAT

02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:31.457
THE- BUT THE WATER BOARD LEVEL

02:00:31.524 --> 02:00:34.427
WERE WERE WERE- WE'RE TAKING

02:00:34.493 --> 02:00:36.696
NOTE OF THAT BECAUSE IT'S GOING

02:00:36.762 --> 02:00:39.298
TO HAVE I THINK IT'S SOMETHING

02:00:39.365 --> 02:00:40.866
THAT WE COULD HAVE NEVER

02:00:40.933 --> 02:00:42.568
PREDICTED. A WHEN I GOT ELECTED

02:00:42.635 --> 02:00:43.803
TWELVE YEARS AGO WE COULD HAVE

02:00:43.869 --> 02:00:44.570
NEVER PREDICTED THAT WOULD

02:00:44.637 --> 02:00:47.974
HAPPEN AND SO- A BILL LIKE THIS

02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:50.376
IS GOING TO HAVE TO COME IN AND

02:00:50.443 --> 02:00:51.444
START TO MAKE VERY DIFFICULT

02:00:51.510 --> 02:00:53.546
DECISIONS. ABOUTHOW WE MANAGE

02:00:53.613 --> 02:00:55.214
WATER BECAUSE I MEAN WE USED TO

02:00:55.281 --> 02:00:57.817
HAVE SEVEN IN SAN DIEGO AND

02:00:57.883 --> 02:01:00.453
TIJUANA RIVER. AND TO SEE THAT

02:01:00.519 --> 02:01:02.455
IT'S NOT EVEN IT'S AT WHERE-

02:01:02.521 --> 02:01:03.923
I'VE HEARD FROM PEOPLE AND I

02:01:03.990 --> 02:01:06.092
NEVER SAW IT BUT BEFORE I GOT

02:01:06.158 --> 02:01:07.360
ELECTED PEOPLE'S USED TO SAY

02:01:07.426 --> 02:01:09.028
THAT THE AMERICAN RIVER USED TO

02:01:09.095 --> 02:01:11.197
TURN RED. WITH ALL THE SALMON

02:01:11.263 --> 02:01:12.498
SWIMMING UPSTREAM. AND I NEVER

02:01:12.565 --> 02:01:14.033
GOT TO SEE THAT AND WE PROBABLY

02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:15.901
NEVER WILL AND THAT'S AND THAT'S

02:01:15.968 --> 02:01:17.303
