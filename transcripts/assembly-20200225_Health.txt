MORNING. WAS A GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME TO THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE IS INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON COST CONTAINMENT PROVIDING HEALTHCARE TO ALL WHO CALL CALIFORNIA HOME HAS BEEN A GOAL OF MINE SINCE I WAS ELECTED. THE ACA'S MADE GREAT PROGRESS IN CALIFORNIA BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE UNINSURED. RECENTLY WE EXPANDED MEDICAID OUT AND INCREASED THE COVER OF THE AFFORDABILITY OF HEALTH CARE. POWER TO MANY FOR NAN'S HEALTH CARE ROOM. ON AFFORDABLE AND REMAIN AND MANY REMAIN UNINSURED. WE CANNOT REACH SCHOOL OF HEALTH CARE FOR ALL WITHOUT ADDRESSING HEALTHCARE COSTS. HEALTHCARE SPENDING CONTINUES TO RISE FROM ALL SOURCES OF COVERAGE JOB BASED MEDI CAL MEDICARE AND PRIVATE INSURANCE AND CONSUMERS ARE THE ONES FEELING THE PINCH. ACCORDING TO A RECENT SURVEY OF AN CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS RATE MAKING HEALTH CARE MORE AFFORDABLE AS A EXTREMELY IMPORTANT OR VERY IMPORTANT PRIORITY FOR THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE TO ADDRESS IN TWENTY TWELVE. MANY STRUGGLING TO PAY THE- CALIFORNIA IS NOT ALONE IN THIS PREDICAMENT VIRTUALLY ALL STATES ARE STRUGGLING TO CONTROL HEALTH CARE SPENDING STATES LIKE MASSACHUSETTS IN OREGON AND RYLAND IST OUT COST CONTAINMENT COMMISSIONS TO MEASURE MONITOR AND SET TARGETS TO CAN WELL HEALTH CARE CAUGHT PRECIP. COST CONTAINMENT. HAS BEEN A WILL COST USING IT'S ALL HERE CLAIMS DAY. TO ESTABLISH RAY FOR ALL SERVICES. SEVENTEEN STATES HAVE ALSO IMPLEMENTED ALL PAY CLAIMS DATABASE. ARE CALLED EIGHT C. D.'S THE CARD HEALTH INSURANCE CLAIMS IN FOR. FROM ALL HEALTHCARE. AMIR'S OTHER STATES THERE IS AN URGENCY TO ADDRESS COSTS. RECENTLY WE SECURED- FUNDING FOR CALIFORNIA START BUILDING ITS OWN HEALTH PAYMENTS DATABASE AND I'VE INTRODUCED A BILL TO ESTABLISH THE FRAMEWORK FOR THIS DATABASE. WHAT THIS DATABASE TO BE OPERATIONAL SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. IN GOVERNOR NUISANCE BUDGET PROPOSAL THIS YEAR HE PROPOSED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY TO DEVELOP OF CARE COST TARGET. AS THIS PROPOSAL AS THE LEGISLATURE EVALUATES VARIOUS EFFORTS IN APPROACHES TO CONTROL HEALTH CARE SPENDING. OPRAH IF WE'RE TO UNDER AND THE OF HEALTH CARE'S. AND LOOK THE EXPERT OF OTHER STATES WHO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED COSCO TARGETS AS A MODEL FOR OUR STATE. I'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK ALL OF OUR SPEAKERS- IN ADVANCE THIS MORNING ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO TRAVELED A LONG JUST. TO FIGHT AND I KNOW THAT THIS SPECIAL TIME ZONES THAT SAY THAT'S A CHALLENGE SO AT THIS POINT AS I SEE IT OUR MEMBERS ANY ANY OTHER HAVE ANYWHERE. COMES THE- SCENE. MOVE THE BILL OKAY ALL RIGHT. WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM AT THAT SO WILL BILL TO DO THAT SO IF POINT I'D LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND START WITH OUR OR FIRST SPEAK LARRY LEVITT. COME ON UP. LARRY IS THE EXACTLY BY PRESIDENT FOR POLICY FOR THE K. FOR FOUNDATION. AND SOMEONE WE KNOW WELL. GOOD MORNING SIR. MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TEST TODAY YEAH THE CHAIRMAN SAID HEALTHCARE J. IN THE COST FOR THE BILL OF HEALTH CARE'S. AS A TOP PRIORITY FOR BOTH AMERICANS AND CALIFORNIANS- I'M GOING TO START THE BIG PICTURE OF HEALTH CARE COSTS- WE IN THE UNITED STATES SPEND THREE POINT SIX TRILLION DOLLARS ON HEALTHCARE HERE. PRESENT EIGHTEEN. ME MORE THAN THOUSAND DOLLARS PERSON IN DOUBLE THE I OF WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES SO. ADDITIONAL LOT OF FOCUS ON A DRUG PRICES BOTH HERE IN THE CAPITAL AS WELL AS THE CROSS THE COUNTRY- AND IT'S CERTAINLY APPROPRIATE DRUG PRICES HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY- PROMINENT. LIFESAVING DRUGS LIKE INSULIN- WHERE THE PRICES HAVE RISEN US IN PEOPLE HAVE IN SOME CASES DIED FROM FROM FROM NOT TAKING THE DRUG THE- BUT THE REALITY IS RETAIL FOR. DRUG THAT JUST NINE PER. OF THE THREE POINT SIX DOLLARS IN HEALTH CARE SPENDING- CONTRAST THAT WITH OVER HALF OF HEALTH CARE SPENDING GOING TO HOSPITALS. OF PHYSICIANS INCLUDE- SO IF YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT HEALTHCARE COSTS CERTAIN THE A FOCUS ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IMPORTANT BUT A FOCUS ON THE MUCH BIGGER. GOING TO SPITTLE AND SHINS AT IS EVEN IMPORTANT. NOW I WOULD KNOW THIS NATIONAL DATA A CAL LOOKS QUITE SIMILAR TO THE HEALTH SYSTEM AND NOW BUT FRANKLY DON'T HAVE GOOD DATA ON MUCH WE SPEND ON HEALTH IN IN THE STATE. THE MOST RECENT DATA FROM FEDERAL. WHICH TRACKS AT HEALTH CARE SPEND ON YOU OBEY IS FROM TWENTY FOURTEEN- FORWARD STATES AND INCLUDING CALIFORNIA. SIX YEARS AGO IT WAS JUST EASIER CARE ACT WAS WAS TAKING A FACT WITH ME CHAIN. ON HEALTH CARE I'M. WE REALLY DO A GOOD PICTURE WE'RE WE'RE SPENDING. YEAH ON ON HEALTH CARE AND- NOW CERTAINLY THEY HAVE PERSON ON THE STREET IS GONNA CARE MUCH OF. THAT DATA AND BUT BUT THE TWO OF THE MATTER IS IT'S HARD TO MAKE PROGRESS ON HEALTH COSTS IF WE DON'T EAT KNOW WHAT. COSTS ARE TO. KIND EFFORTS THURMOND WITH WAS TALKING ABOUT TO COLLECT BUT DATA TO PUT US. ON HEALTHCARE COSTS IN AFFORDABILITY- IN THE STATE WOULD BE CONTRA. NOW I DON'T AND MINIMIZE THE- OF HEALTH COSTS CITIES FOR. A BIG PROBLEM WHICH I'M GOING TO TALK MORE ABOUT- BUT IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT THE GROWTH IN HEALTHCARE COSTS- HAS IN FACT SLOWED. DRAMATICALLY OVER TIME- IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND EIGHT IS DOUBLE DIGIT INCREASES IN HEALTHCARE SPENDING WERE QUITE ROUTINE AND- MUST INCREASES. FAR OUT IS THE GROWTH A THE A- OVER. IN THE KERN DECADE SPENDING IS AB. LESS FOUR PER. JOE BARELY GREATER THAN THAN. P. THE- ISN'T FRANK NO CONSENSUS ON HEALTH CARE SPEND GROWTH HAS SLOWED MUCH SOME PASTA. AND A LOW AND LOW GROWTH IN PRICES IN ECONOMY GENERALLY. A SORE. NO I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH A SENSE THAT THE PICTURES ALL ROSY- WELL HEALTH SPENDING GROWTH REACHED A LOW POINT- EARLIER IN THE DECADE IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN- IT'S BEEN RISING SUBSTANTIALLY FAST. SINCE THEN AND INSTEAD OF GROWING OVER 5% PER YEAR SIMILAR TO WHAT WE SAW IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES AND TWO THOUSANDS. HEALTHCARE IS GROWING FASTER THAT PLACE MUCH FASTER THAN WORK. JUST A SO WE STILLHAVE A IG HEALTH CARE COST AND AFFORDABILITY PROBLEM IS LIKELY TO GET WORSE RATHER AND THAT. SOME EVIDENCE THE HEALTH CARE COST. PROBLEM IS EVEN WORSE I CALIFORNIA THEN THEN IT IS IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY- IT'S USEFUL TO FOCUS HERE ON EMPLOYER BASED INSURANCE THAT'S WHERE MOST PEOPLE- GET. FOR MORE PEOPLE THAN ANY. OTHER SOURCE GET GET COVERAGE- AND WHILE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT A LOT TO ADDRESS AFFORDABILITY FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO EMPLOYER COVERAGE. I DID LITTLE FOR THE MUCH LOWER GROUP OF. TO GET EMPLOYER AND PRINCE. BUT STILL HAVE TROUBLE FOR. CROSS THE- BRIDGE IS THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN DOLLARS MOST OF WHICH IS PAID BY EMPLOYERS- BUSINESSES AND CALIFORNIA THE PREMIUM THE AVERAGE PREMIUM IS ABOUT 6% HIGHER THAN THAT AT ALL TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND OF COURSE THE PREMIUM DOESN'T TELL THE WHOLE STORY SINCE PEOPLE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL AND GROWING OUT OF POCKET COSTS AS WELL- WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF ALL THE COSTS FOR FAMILY FOR- WITH INSURANCE PAID BY EMPLOYERS WERE. TAKEN OUT OF THEIR PAYCHECKS AND- I AM WITH A OUT OF. DOUBLES IN COPAYS. OF THAT NOW TOPS TWELVE TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR ON AVERAGE FOR A FAMILY. OF FAMILIES THEMSELVES ARE NOW SPENDING ALMOST EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR THAT UP 67% OVER THE LAST LAST DECADE. BUT STILL AS MUCH AS FAMILIES ARE PAYING THE LION'S SHARE OF THESE INSURANCE COSTS ARE STILL PAID NINE. YEARS AS A GROWING COST BURDEN FOR BUSINESSES AND A DRAG ON WAGES AS MORE OF COMPENSATION GOES TO HELP. RATHER. THE. DEDUCTIBLES IN PARTICULAR HAVE RAISED AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES FOR PATIENTS AND DEDUCTIBLES AN EMPLOYER BASED PLANS ARE UP A HUNDRED AND 62% IN THE LAST TEN YEARS MEETING AT WHICH THE DOCTOR BILLS ARE NOT MORE THAN TWO AND A HALF TIMES WHAT THEY WERE A DECADE AGO OVER THAT SAME WORKERS THINGS ARE UP JUST TWENTY SIX PERCENT. SO DEDUCTION INCREASD SIX TIMES FASTER THAN WILL WORK MAVERICK YOU'RE MAKING A LEADING TO AN AFFORDABILITY CAPPED AT CAP FOR WORKERS IN IN A PIECE OF GOOD NEWS OR MAYBE LESS BAD NEWS- FOR CALIFORNIA DEDUCTIBLES ARE ONE AREA- WE'RE CALIFORNIANS ARE SOMEWHAT BETTER OFF- FORTY. DEDUCTIBLE MUCH LOWER THAN THE EMPLOYER BASED PLANTS- AND THE AVERAGE DEDUCTIBLE IN CALIFORNIA'S FOURTEEN HUNDRED AND TWO DOLLARS. HIGHLY LOWER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. PART OF THE REASON FOR THIS IS A MUCH HIGHER PENETRATION OF HMO IS IN THE STATE- FORTY FIVE PERCENT- IN CALIFORNIA VERSES THOSE ARE. LESS LIKELY OF DOCTOR BILLS- THEN- OTHER TYPES OF PLANS LIKE PPO IS. I'M IN CALIFORNIA DEDUCTIBLES HAVE GOTTEN OT. FOR HUNDRED DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE CAN FEEL LIKE NO INSURANCE AT ALL- WHEN YOU HAVE NEXT TO NOTHING IN THE BANK- SAVE FOR A RAINY DAY AS IS THE CASE FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS. ACCORDING TO FEDERAL RESERVE ABOUT 40% OF AMERICANS WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO COVER A FOUR HUNDRED DOLLAR EMERGENCY- WITH CASH SAVINGS. OR CREDIT CARD CHARGE THAT THEY CAN QUICKLY PAY OFF- SO- AND THAT'S MUCH LESS THAN THE AVERAGE DEDUCTIBLE SO AGAIN THIS FOR MANY PEOPLE MAY FEEL LIKE- LIKE ALMOST NO INSURANCE AT ALL. NOW TO AS BAD AS AN AN OUTDATED AS THE DATA STATEWIDE ON HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE- IT'S FRANKLY EVEN WORSE REGIONALLY- WE DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT HOW HEALTHCARE COSTS VARY ACROSS THAT. VERY LARGE STATE- BUT THERE ARE SOME INDICATIONS THAT HEALTH CARE BECAUSE DO VERY TREMENDOUS. IF FOR EXAMPLE AT. YOUR PREMIUMS OVER CAL IN LA- THE LOWEST COST BROWN'S PLAN FOR FORTY YEAR OLD THIS YEAR IS LESS THAN THIRTY THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS- THAT'S IT'S SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER IN SACRAMENTO AND SAN FRANCISCO- EVEN HIGHER IN THE FAR NORTH OF THE STATE- INSURANCE AND EUREKA FOR EXAMPLE. 52% MORE EXPENSIVE- THAT EL NOW THIS IS VERY LIKELY TIGHT UNDERLYING COST OF HEALTHCARE IN THESE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES- IT'S PROBABLY NOT THE CASE THAT PEOPLE IN SAN FRANCISCO OR SACRAMENTO OR EUREKA. THAT MUCH SICKER THAN PEOPLE IN LOS ANGELES- MORE LIKELY IS THAT HEALTHCARE PRICES ARE SIMPLY MUCH HIGHER IN THOSE COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S DUE IN PART TO. SOLID ATION AMONG HOSPITALS PROVIDERS. I IN THE AREA SACRAMENTO. IS PROVIDED HAVE MUCH GREATER LEVERAGE TO DEMAND HIGHER PRICES- IN IN RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE- WHERE THERE ARE MANY FEWER PROVIDERS LEVERAGE CAN BE EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED. I'M REALLY IN OUR HOT GROWING PRICE ARE THE FACTORY. INCREASING HEALTH CARE COSTS- THE FACT THAT WE SPEND DOUBLE PER PERSON WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES SPEND IS NOT BECAUSE WE ARE SICKER WE USE MORE CARE. THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE. HIGHER PRICES FOR THE CARE AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS WE USE- WE HAVE A PRICE PROBLEM IN THE UNITED STATES BUT IT'S REALLY A PRIVATE PRICE PROBLEM- HI. THERE IT'S TRADED IN PRIVATE INSURANCE WERE PRICE GROWTH HAS BEEN FAR OUTPACING- MEDICARE. AND MEDICAID OR MEDICARE HEALTH- WE'RE PRICE INCREASES HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE MODEST ESTIMATES VERY GENERALLY SPEAKING PRIVATE INSURERS PAY ABOUT DOUBLE FOR HOT WHAT. TO MAKE THIS A LITTLE MORE TANGIBLE THE PRICES PAID BY PRIVATE INSURERS FOR KNEE REPLACEMENT HAS INCREASED FOR EXAMPLE FROM UNDER TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TWO THOUSAND THREE AT OVER THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND TWENTY. AGAIN THAT INFORMATION. WELL NOT AS BIG A DRIVER OF HEALTH CARE COST GROWTH IS PRICES- THE ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS ALSO GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY OVER TIME AT THE SHARE OF HEALTH SPENDING DEVOTED TO INSURANCE OVERHEAD TWO AND A HALF AN OF OVERALL HEALTH SPENDING A DECADES AGO TO OVER 7% THIS IS DAVID MINISTER. WITH MEN DIFFERENT ENSURE- ANDTHAT AND THAT COST IS NOT JUST THE OVERHEAD AND PROFIT FROM INSURERS THAT WE SEE HERE BUT IT ALSO LEADS TO HIGHER COSTS IN IN- BILLING DEPARTMENTS AND HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIAN OFFICES WHICH ARE IN ADDITION- NUMBERS. OKAY NOW ALTERNATELY WHY CARE ABOUT HEALTHCARE COSTS IS BECAUSE WHAT IT MEANS FOR AFFORDABILITY FOR GOVERNMENT FOR BUSINESSES AND OF COURSE FOR PATIENTS. A RECENT SURVEY FROM THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION FOUND THAT 51% OF CALIFORNIANS POST. SCRIPT HERE IN THE LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF CAUGHT. IN THE SAY THAT HAVE THEIR HEALTHCARE GOT WORSE AS A RESULT OF. IN THE NATIONAL WE DID WITH EMPLOYER BASED INSURANCE WE FOUND WIDESPREAD AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES. A 40% HAD SOME TYPE OF PROBLEM AFFORDING HEALTH CARE IN THE LAST YEAR INCLUDING PROBLEMS PAYING MEDICAL BILL PAYING FOR DEDUCTIBLES. HANDLING COPAYS FOR DRUG. OR PAYING THEIR THEIR MONTH. AND THIS IS OF COURSE. PROBLEM HEALTH DUE TO THE BUT IT'S ALSO POINT TO REMEMBER THAT THE INABILITY TO AFFORD HEALTH CARE ALSO LEADS TO FINANCIAL AND SECURITY MORE GENERALLY MANY PEOPLE SAID THE PROBLEM SUPPORTING CARE IN THE LAST YEAR REPORTER PAINS OF SACRIFICES SUCH AS PUTTING OFF MAJOR PURCHASES CUTTING SPENDING ON FOOD PULLED ITEMS CAN CURRENT CARD DEBT- INCREASING UP ALL OUR MISTER THERE'S- I REMEMBER THIS IS. JOB AND WITH AND IN MANY CASES OF. SO THE QUESTION THINK UP THE COST HEALTHCARE IT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT BRING BACK I THINK TO WHAT IT MEANS FOR PEOPLE AND WHAT IT MEANS PORTABILITY. BOTH PEOPLE'S AND FOR PEOPLE'S ECONOMIC SECURITY AT REDUCING HEALTHCARE COSTS IS HARD INVOLVES DIFFICULT TRADE OFFICES I KNOW MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE- NO WELL. THAT IS QUOTES CONSTANT TO AND SOME TO REMEMBER. THANK QUESTIONS. QUESTION. I APPRECIATE THIS IS REALLY GREAT INFORMATION- I KEEP CAN GOING BACK TO MANY PEOPLE ARE SENIORS AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE AFFORDABILITY OF CARE AND- TO THE CONSEQUENCES AS WE TRY TO ADJUST ANY THIS IS REALLY I THINK THREATENING TO SOME SEEM. IS THERE ANY. I KNOW WORKING ON GAME DAYS DO THE YOU MIGHT HAVE ON SENIORS I MEAN I DO KNOW IN YOUR ORGANIZATION- DOING PREVENTATIVE CARE AND SENIORS ARE GOING. YOUR FACILITIES WE- CANNOT. FORGET AS WE GET OLDER WE STILL NEED PREVENTIVE CARE. SO IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU HAVE ALL ALONG WITH THE SENIOR POPULATION- AT I SHOULD CLARIFY ONE THING I'M FROM THE- KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION WHICH IS TOTALLY SEPARATE FROM KAISER PERMANENTE. GETS WHICH NAME SO IT IS KIND BUT WERE A TOTALLY SEPARATE ORGANIZATION BUT WE DO HAVE QUITE A BIT OF DATA ON- OUT OF POCKET COSTS FOR SENIORS AND I'D BE HAPPY. TO ADD HERE- AND I THINK YOU KNOW WE SAW. FORGET UP TO CLEAN THE CONTACT OF- THE DISCUSSIONS OF MEDICARE FOR ALL WHICH WOULD EXPAND. MEDICARE LIKE PROGRAM IT THREE ONE THAT IN. THE CURRENT MEDIC PRO INVOLVES SUBSTANTIAL COST SUBSTANTIAL PREMIUMS- SUBSTANTIAL OUT OF POCKET COSTS- FOR SENIORS AND- YOU KNOW MANY PEOPLE BUY SUPPLEMENTAL INSURANCE BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT. OF MEDICARE DOESN'T FOR SO HERE. WE HAVE A LOT OF DEBT ON ON THE- BURDEN. SENIOR BE HAPPENING. THANK. A COUPLE COUPLE IN FIRST UP MUCH APPRECIATE THE IN IS A AND EVERY TIME YOU SPEAKER HERE SPEAK I LEARN SOMETHING NEW- AND- BUT A COUPLE COUPLE SHINS- IN YOUR WHEN YOUR FOR YOUR SECOND BY- YOU TALK TO. WITH ONE OF THE EARLY FIGHTS YOU TALKED ABOUT DRUGS BEING NINE PERCENT- I'VE HEARD OTHER WORDS WE HAD A HEARING HERE THAT 9% SO. WHAT IS AT 9% IS THAT WITH THE CONSUMERS AND AT THE AT THE PHARMACY BECAUSE- I'LL JUST LAY IT OUT THERE. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT INCLUDES WHAT WHAT- AMATORY SURGERY CENTER SPAN OR HOSPITALS OR- OTHERS OTHER KINDS OF OUTPATIENT FACILITIES SO IS THAT A FAIR CHARACTERIZATION NO THAT'S A VERY FAIR CARE PATIENTS OF DIAPERS REPRESENTS DREW. SPEND AT RETAIL PHARMACY BOTH WHAT CONSUMERS BàN. SHIRTS OR AT MEDICARE MEDICAID I STAND IT DOES NOT INCLUDE- AS YOU SAID YOUR DRUGS MR PHYSICIAN OFF IS JALAL. HOSPITAL SO YOU KNOW THAT'S- THE YOU KNOW COULD BE AS AS DEL. NUMBER AND IN IN THOSE DRUG I MEAN. CONSUMERS DON'T MESS SEE THE COST OF SOME OF DRUGS DIRECTLY THEY SHOW UP IN A HOSPITAL BILL- BUT THEY THEY CERTAINLY REPRESENT- SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSE. YES THE NUMBER WE HAD HEARD WAS CLOSED ABOUT CLOSE TO TWENTY WHICH IS BUT DOUBLE YEAH THAT'S RIGHT AS ONE OF THAT THAT YEAH THAT IS NOT NINE PERCENT. FOR OVERALL AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT CARES THAT CERTAINLY I THINK THE INDUSTRY WOULD LIKE TO THINK IT'S A NINETY CENT. BUT THE REALITY IS IT'S MUCH MORE IT'S ALSO GREAT IS JUST PUT IN DIFFERENT PLACES SO- WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE COPS YOU KNOW HOW WE AND SEVEN. DIRECTION SPENDING THE RATE INCREASE WAS HIGHER HIS BEEN YOU KNOW KIND OF DAHLE COST AVERAGE IT FOR THE FACT THAT MAYBE THINGS WERE REALLY CHEAP IN NINETEEN SEVENTY. VERSES NOW WE MRI EYES AND- CAP GAINS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SO. DATA EVER BEEN I STILL. THE REAL. NUMBER IS PERSISTENT. BECAUSE MY IN AS A KID I REMEMBER. MY FOLKS EVER COMPLAINING ABOUT. DO AND I YOU KNOW AS A KID I REMEMBER MANY TIMES BEING AN EMERGENCY ROOMS FOR STUPID THINGS. THAT I DID. AND IT BUT I DON'T EVER REMEMBER THAT BEING AN ISSUE AND- AND- YEAH I KNOW NOT WHAT I WAS SAID I WAS FRANKLY KIDS TEND TO I WAS NOT STARTING HEALTH POLICY. BUT THERE ARE- I MEAN THE SEVENTIES WERE. WITH VERY HIGH INFLATION RIGHT SO JUST JUST GENERALLY SO A DOUBLE DIGIT INCREASE IN HEALTHCARE COSTS DIDN'T QUITE FEEL LIKE THE SAME WAY IT DID DID TODAY. YEAH INSURANCE LOOKED VERY DIFFERENT THAN- YOU KNOW PEOPLE DIDN'T FACE BIG DEDUCTIBLES- SO FOR A FROM A FAMILY'S PERSPECTIVE- THE OUT OF POCKET COSTS SHOULDN'T FEEL LIKE SUCH A BURDEN AS AS IT DID TODAY- IN IN SINCE THEN HEALTHCARE COSTS HAVE RISEN DRAMATICALLY FASTER THAN PEOPLE'S WAGES. SO YOU KNOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HEALTH CARE COST SLOWING DOWN- IF WE IS ARE SLOWING DOWN EVEN MORE- IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY FEEL GOOD GUY TO A FAMILY- NOW I THINK THE PARTY QUESTIONS IS. KIND OF WHAT WHAT WE GET FOR THIS EXTRA MONEY- OF EUROPE WE DIDN'T HAVE MRI BACK THEN- RIGHT NOW WITH ALL THE SPEND AN MRI TODAY. WHILE NOT CLEAR. BUT A LOT OF CASES WHERE WE GET BETTER AT CARE TODAY WE YOU KNOW. OF DRY THAT PEOPLE'S LIVES IN SOME CASES SAVE THEIR LIVES- SO WE CERTAINLY ARE GETTING MORE HEALTH HEALTH CARE TODAY- BUT BUT THE BUT THE BIG. THERE IS EVEN HEALTHCARE WE GOT BACK THAT NOW COST A WHOLE LOT MORE. AND I GUESS THE FINAL IS JUST MORE OF A POINT I THINK THAN A QUESTION I MEAN I REPRESENT EUREKA AND THAT SITE THAT'S PROBABLY NO ACCIDENT THAT SOME ICE ON THAT SIDE THEY'RE- IT IS PRETTY. ACCURATE SEE THAT. WE'RE PAYING 50% HIGHER PREMIUM 50% HIGHER PREMIUM THAN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND WHILE YOU MAY. HOSPITAL CONSOLIDATION. AS BEING A PART OF THAT- I THINK THAT THERE'S ALSO I THINK THERE'S AFFILIATED MEDICAL GROUPS THAT DRIVE RATES AS WELL. WHICH BECOME A PART OF PART OF THAT A PART OF THAT FACTOR AS WELL- AND THEN YOU GET TO KNOW YOU GET UP INTO YOUR RIG. AND THEY'RE THEY'RE SIMPLY. A LOT. FOR BY. BUT A LOT. OF CHOICE THERE AND I WILL I WILL YOU KNOW. TRUST ME AT. FORTY NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN EUREKA VERSUS FORTY SEVEN DOLLARS AND CISCO. A LOT OF. WAIT TO SEE YOU MAKE AN FRANCISCO TO THE BY. IN IN RE. CALIFORNIA IS REALLY BIG AND PAINFUL FOR A OF PEOPLE WHO ALSO HAVE TO TRAVEL LONG DISTANCES TO GET. A LOT OF SPECIALTY CARE SOMETIMES STUFF. SO APPRECIATE- ONCE AGAIN IT WAS MORE OF A POINT IN EDITORIAL- BUT- BUT IT IS THE STRUGGLE THAT THAT WE FACE SENATE'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DRIVES ME TO. TO LOOK AT HOW DO WE MAKE THINGS MORE PORTABLE PEOPLE IT BECAUSE IT'S CLEARLY NOT IN IN IN PARTS OF OUR STATE HI I WOULD SAY HAVEN'T I MEAN EUREKA STANDS OUT YOUR PERSPECTIVE OF IT. HUNTING PARTY DISTRICT BUT THE- THE PROP IN IN RURAL THE COST IN RURAL AREAS ARE ARECOMPLICATED YOU KNOW ON THE ONE HAND. SPITTLE ISSUE. WHERE THERE'S NOT A LOT OF THEY HAVE LEVERAGE TO TRY CHARGE HIGHER PRICES AB IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A THE CASE THAT THE PROVIDERS ARE YOU KNOW FLOOD WITH MONEY EITHER SO IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S A TOUGH IT'S A TOUGH PROBLEM TO SOLVE. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND IF THERE ISN'T. QUESTIONS WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD MOVEMENT THEY CRIED THANK YOU REALLY APPRECIATE IT SO. OUR OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS JAMIE KING. AND TALK ENTREE AND APPROACHES TO HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION SHE'S AN ASSOCIATE DEAN. I'M BY ON M. GREGORY IN BUSINESS WHAT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW. THANK YOU. MORNING. WE'LL GET MORE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OP TO BE I'M REALLY EXCITED SO I ALWAYS LIKE TO FOLLOW BECAUSE HE'S ME OFF REALLY WELL BUT DO NOT IN ORDER TO SET THE STAGE A LITTLE BIT MORE AND WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT IT WOULD GIVE YOU A COMPARISON OF OUR- PLANS WOULD COST THEY HAD INCREASED AT THE SAME RATE BETTER HEALTH CARE. WOULD TODAY FORTY EIGHT DOLLARS IF THEY INCREASE AT THE SAME PRICE SAME RATE AS HEALTH CARE. A DOZEN EGGS FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS. AND A GALLON OF MILK AND NOT A GRASS FED ORGANIC GALLON OF MILK JUST A REGULAR GALLON OF MILK. ACOSTA AND THIRTY FOUR DOLLARS RIGHT. AND SO WHAT THIS TELLS US IS THERE SOMETHING REALLY HAPPENING WITH OUR CARE PRICES AND IT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OTHER NATIONS. AREAS THAT CAN SEE. I CAN SPEND ON OUR TWICE AS MUCH AND SOMETIME TWO AND A HALF TIMES AS MUCH WHAT PEOPLE AND COMPARED IT NATION'S ALSO IS FOR THE SAME HEALTH CARE GOODS AND SERVICES. ACES ARE THE PRIMARY REASON WHY THE US SPENDS MORE ON HEALTHCARE THAN IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY. AND THE QUESTION IS WHY. ME SO I'M GONNA TALK IN THE IN THE REALM OF COMPETITION THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED BUT I'M GONNA TALK PRETTY EXCLUSIVELY ABOUT CONSOLIDATION COMPETITION BECAUSE IT IS THE BIGGEST DRIVER OF THE PROBLEM AND THERE'S A FEW THINGS THAT WE FAIL TO DO AS A NATION. FAILED TO. THE S. AND LIMóN SPUR FREE MARKET ESPECIALLY RELATED AROUND PRICE TRANSPARENCY WE FAIL TO PROTECT COMPETITION AND RIGOROUSLY ENFORCE OUR ANTI TRUST LAWS. WHEN WE TO REGULATE TO CONTROL PRICES WHEN COMPETITION NO LONGER EXISTED. SO LET'S START WITH THE FAILURE TO PROTECT PRICE TRANSPARENCY AS MANY OF YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SURPRISE BILLING- THROUGHOUT THE NATION. TWO THIRDS OF AMERICANS DON'T KNOW THE PRICE OF THEIR HEALTHCARE THEY CAN'T PLAN FOR IT THEY CAN'T. GET AROUND IT THIS THAT THE PRICES ARE NOT OEN AND AVAILABLE TO THEM. THE MOST PART FURTHERMORE THIS IS BASED THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES A CATALYST FOR PAYMENT REFORM. AT PUTS OUT A PRICE TRANSPARENCY REPORT CARD AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE IT IS THAT THE MAJORITY OF STATES INCLUDING CALIFORNIA GET A FAILING GRADE ON PROVIDING PRICED. PARENTS DO TO THEIR CONSUMERS. BUT THE POINT I MEAN TO YOU TODAY ABOUT PRIDE. ABOUT PRICE TRENDS. ARE PER PARENTS STRAWBERRY. IS REALLY MARKET POWER GLORY ALL. IT'S ABOUT THE BILL. I PROVIDER OR- AND SHE ORGAN WITH A LOT OF MARKET POWER TO KEEP THOSE PRICES SECRET TO INCLUDE GAG CLAUSES IN THEIR CONTRACTS TO KEEP THEM SECRET AS WE SAW IN THE CENTER CASE BUT ALSO TO KEEP THEM SECRET USE OF TRADE SECRETS PROTECTIONS. I MIGHT ADD THEY'RE NOT SHALL AND I DON'T THINK THAT THEY WOULD ALWAYS STAND UP IN COURT BUT THE ANOTHER BEING USE AND SO THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE GET THIS MUCH MARKET POWER WHAT YOU CAN SEE ON THIS SLIDE IF YOU CAN READ IT HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR NOTES. IS THE- BASICALLY FROM. NINETY ONE TO TWENTY ELEVEN. OVER TWENTY YEARS. THE FTC DIDN'T WIN A SINGLE HOSPITAL MERGER CASE. HE DIDN'T WIN ONE AND IT COULD BE SICKLY COMES DOWN TO WHAT WAS A MISMATCH BETWEEN OUR ANY TRUST LAWS IN THE WAY THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT THEM WHAT WAS REALLY HAPPENING IN THE HOSPITAL MARKET BUT WHAT IT MEANT WAS THE FTC STOP BRING. KEITH SOURCES FOR THE- BUT THE SECOND THING THAT HAPPENED AS A RESULT OF THAT IS WE ENDED UP WITH HEALTH CARE MERGER MANIA EVERYBODY STARTED CONSOLIDATING WITH EVERYBODY ELSE AND SO WE SAW HOSPITAL'S MERGING WITH OTHER SPITTLE MERGING WITH OTHER HOSPITALS FORMING HEALTH SYSTEMS AND THEN WE THOSE HEALTH SYSTEM STARTING TO ENGAGE IN VERTICAL MERGERS WHERE THEY WERE ACQUIRED FISHING GROUPS AND CLINICS AND STARTING TING. I KIND OF VERTICAL LINE AND NOW WHAT'S GROWTH ACROSS MARKET MERGERS WHERE. YOU KNOW HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN SAID CISCO OR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA STARTS TO ACQUIRE KEY PROVIDER ORGANIZATIONS ARE KEY HOSPITALS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND WHAT W KNOW ABOUT ALL OF THIS CONSOLIDATION FROM THE DATA. IS IT THE PRICES GO UP AND THE QUALITY STAYS THE SAME OR IN SOME CASES GOES DOWN. SELECT TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT. WITH HORIZONTAL THE DATA IS VERY CLEAR WE SEE INCREASE PRICES ACROSS THE BOARD OF TWENTY 2404% FOLLOWING THE MERGER. WE SEE REDUCE QUALITY THESE MURDERS ARE STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCTIONS IN QUALITY INCLUDING IN. HIGHER QUALITY. I'M TO SEE A PREMIUMS OF THIS IF DIRECTLY WHAT CONSUMERS PAY FOR THEIR PRICE FOR THEIR PREMIUMS ON THE ACA MARKET. AND ALSO REDUCTIONS IN WAGE GROWTH FOR NURSES AND ENVIRONMENT THIS WORKING IN THESE ORGANIZATIONS. FOR A VERTICAL MERGERS WE ALSO SEE HIGHER PRICES WE SEE HIGHER PHYSICIAN PRICES AFTER ACQUISITION HIGHER CLINIC PRICES SOMETIMES AS MUCH AS FORTY SEVEN PERCENT. AFTER ACQUISITION WE ALSO SEE THE WIRING HOSPITAL OUR HOSPITAL SYSTEM ALSO INCREASED THEIR PRICES AS FOLLOWING AN ACQUISITION OF A KEY PHYSICIAN GROUP. AND REALLY HERE IS WE SEE LIVE TO NO. AND WHAT THAT REALLY MATTERS IS SOMETIMES THESE VERTICAL MERGERS ARE JUSTIFIED ON THE BASIS OF THEIR GOING TO PROVIDE MORE EFFICIENCIES WHICH MEANS IS SUPPOSED TO MEAN LOWER PRICES THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO GO ON. DON'T SEE THAT. AND WE- AND JUST. MICHAEL IMPROVEMENT GOING TO STREAMLINE ALL THESE PROCEED IT'S GONNA BETTER FOR EVERY. BUT WHAT THE DATA TELLS US AS WE DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING WE ONLY SEE HIGHER PRICES AND EITHER THE SAME OR NAY QUALITY IMPROVEMENT. THE OTHER THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO FOCUS ON WITH VERTICAL MERGERS. IS IT THE IN LIKELY TO TRIGGER. ANY VIEW IF YOU'RE ACQUIRING A PHYSICIAN GROUP IT DOESN'T AND TIMES IT THE THRESHOLD FOR THE HEART DINO ELLING SO THEY DON'T IT OFTEN DOESN'T. QUITE BY TO HAVE THIS TO THE FEDERAL. IN CALIFORNIA SO THE FLY BELOW ANY TRUST RATE ARE A LOT OF TIMES AND THIS CAN LEAD TO WHAT'S KNOWN AS STEP. VALIDATION WHERE GROUPS ARE AMASSING MARKET WITHOUT A LOT OF ANTI TRUST AND NOTICE OF IT. SO LET ME ALSO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT CROSS MARKET MERGERS BECAUSE THE BEEN GROWING A LOT IN NUMBER AND HISTORICALLY INTERESTING FORCES HAVE THOUGHT THAT THERE'S NO POSSIBLE WAY THAT ACROSS MARKET MURDER COULD. PRICE INCREASES OR ANY COMPETITOR THEY HAVE PAID LITTLE TO NO ATTENTION TO THEM. BUT WHAT THE DATA TELLS US IS THAT UNDERSTANDING IS NOT QUITE ACCURATE OR AT LEAST IT SUGGESTED THAT IT'S NOT ACCURATE AND WELL. BEING FOLLOWING THESE MARKET MEASURES IS INCREASE PRICES SEVENTY SEVEN. 9% FOR THE HOUSE THAT ARE REQUIRED. LET'S IS THAT THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE. MORE DATA AND MARK ON THIS BUT THERE'S DEFINITELY HAPPENING THERE THAT WE SHOULD BE PAYING INTENT. THE OTHER THING REALLY SAYING IS WE- THE FACT ON. IN MARK WHERE THE INDEPENDENT. ACQUIRED INDEED. QUITE BUT IT PASSED ALSO FOUND IN THE MARK TO THEN IN THEIR PRICE I AND SO HE'S MERGERS ARE CAUSING PRICES OCCUR THE BOARD NOT IN JUST A AFFECTED HOSPITAL AND OBVIOUSLY NEED MORE DATE THAT BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN FOUND. SO INCREASED WHEN HE HAS BEEN INCREASING IN CONSOLIDATION FAIRLY CONSISTENTLY AND YOU CAN WE WERE SORT OF MODERATELY CONSOLIDATED IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN BUT BY TWENTY SIXTEEN WE WERE VERY SIGNIFICANTLY AND HIGHLY CONSOLIDATED IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. NO THAT NO AS LARRY POINTED OUT BEFORE THIS LEADS TO ANY AN INCREASE PRICE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ON AVERAGE OF ABOUT THIRTY THREE PERCENT. 3% HIGHER PRICES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA- IN LARGE PART DUE TO THIS CONSOLIDATION. FURTHERMORE WE SEE THAT THE DRIVER OF PRICE IS OUR HOSPITAL. IN A LARGE LARGEST. AND SO WE WERE THE HIGHER A CORRELATED ASPECT AS WELL AND SO WE'RE ALL OF THIS LEADS US HE IS IT OVERALL AS A NATION NINE OVER 90% OF OUR HOSPITAL GETS ARE HIGHLY CONCENTRATED. LOS PERCENT ORANGE MARKETS ARE HIGHLY OR SUPER CONCENTRATED BUT IT DOESN'T STOP WITH JUST INSURERS AND HOSPITALS RIGHT OUR SPECIALIST POSITIONS ARE OVER 60% HIGHLY OR SUPER CONCENTRATED. AND THE NUMBER AND THE- TIONS THAT ARE BECOMING HIGHLY OR CONSUMER CONSOLIDATED IS ALSO GOING UP AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY MAKE A LOT OF REFERRALS AND SO THEY BECOME THAT THE TARGET FOR A LOT OF WHAT'S- SO THE QUESTION NOW IS WHAT. TIME FIRST HAVE TO GET YEAH AND SO I REALLY APPLY THE EFFORT TO CREATE AN ALL HERE CLAIMS DATABASE IN CALIFORNIA I THINK IT'S EXTRA IMPORT TALK A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THAT SECOND WE NEED TO ENHANCE OUR ANY INFO MEN. AND WE NEED. A PLACE FOR COMPOSITION AND GET OF THE IS SO LET'S START WITH UP HERE CLAIMS DATA. SO ORIGINALLY ALL CLAIMS DATABASE WHERE DOES TO PER. BETTER IN. TO CONSUMERS TO HELP THEM MORE EFFECTIVELY SHOP FOR HIGH VALUE SERVICES. WILL WE SOON FOUND OUT WAS THAT THIS WAS WAY MORE USE FOR POLICY IN ENFORCEMENT. AND THE REALITY IS THE STATE OF CAN PROVIDE VERY ACCURATE INFORMATION ON THE FUNCTIONING OF OUR MARKET THEY CAN TELL US WHAT'S GOING RIGHT AND WHAT'S WRONG. THE FIRM. MERGER ASSIST VIEW AS WE'VE SEEN IN MASSACHUSETTS HEALTH POLICY AND USE THEIR DATA VERY DELETED CHALLENGE MURDERS. THE AND IF I. THE COST TRACTATES. A NATION. TRACK UTILIZATION AND PRICE TRENDS. AND HELP IDENTIFY THE USE OF LOW VALUE SERVICES SO THAT WE CAN HELP PREVENT THAT AS WELL. THE WHOLE HOST OF THINGS THAT THE STATE CAN BE USED FOR I THINK IT WONDER WE'RE GOING AT IT. NOW THAT. CAN CONSERVE SO ONE OF THE FIRST. NEED TO DO YOU AS A STATE. IT IMPROVE OUR PRIMA ISLAND WE NEED TO PREVENT THIS KIND OF CONSOLIDATION BEFORE IT HAPPENS BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE HAVE BETTER NOTIFICATION OF MERGERS AND HEALTH CARE HAPPENING AND NOT JUST LITTLE MERGERS BRIDGES ACROSS THE BOARD SO WHETHER IT'S A OF A POSITION OR SOMETHING ELSE. OVERSIGHT BRED SO BETTER VIEW PROCEDURES AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT THAT CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE IT JUST PREVENTING THE CONSOLIDATION ANYMORE CONSOLIDATION BEFORE IT HAPPENS. THE SECOND IS. CLEARLY NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO PREVENT EVERY MERGER FROM HAPPENING IN THIS SPACE GOING FORWARD BUT THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO WHEN EMERGING. GO THROUGH TO GRANT OVERSIGHT AND ENSURE THAT SOME OF THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OR SEEN HAPPEN. I CAN BE YOU. THE USE OF CONSENT PLEASE WHICH IS VERY AFFECT. REAL LET. OF DURING MESSAGES YOU PM SEE IT HIGH RECENT. AND THE C. H. DID MANY CASE HE CAL. AND SO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT STATES ARE LOOKING AT AS A PART OF CONSENT AGREES AND BOB PERRANCE AND CATHERINE GOOD X. AND SOME OTHER CALL RISE MURRAY OTHER COLLEGE. PUT OUT A PAPER THAT A TYPE. OF CONSENT DECREE. AND WE FOUND THAT STATES FOR YOU THESE CONSENT DECREES TO IMPOSE AN- ACCESS TO BINDING ARBITRATION TO PUT PRICE CAPS IN PRICE. PREVENT PRICE INCREASES OVER A CERTAIN PER INCH TO. ANY COMPETITIVE CONTRACT CLAUSES IN THE CONTRACT OF THESE ENTITIES OR WHETHER THAT WAS FAVORITE NEED CLAUSES THE GAG CLAUSES I WAS PREVIOUSLY TALKING ABOUT. CHOIR AND THE- CITY FROM INFO NON CAN CLAUSE IN THIS HE BE VERY IMPORTANT. FOR EMPLOYEES AND ALLOWING COMPETITION HE SPACES AND THEY CAN BE USED TO ENSURE ACCESS TO LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS. FINALLY WE NEED TO CONTINUE CHALLENGING ANY COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR AT THE CALIFORNIA AG JUST SUCCESSFULLY DID IN THE SUTTER CASE AND SO WE NEED TO KEEP BRINGING THOSE CHALLENGES TO POST MERGER ENTITIES BETTERING USING THEIR MARKET POWER IN ANY COMPETITIVE WAYS. SEEN AS BOTH INSIDE AND IN EACH CASE AND SOME OF THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENTS FROM CASES I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SO FIRST AND MOST PROHIBITS ALL OR NOTHING I'M TRACKING FROM. GOING THE LARGE HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS FROM NEGOTIATING AS ONE WHOLE AND REQUIRING THAT YOU TAKE THE END HIGHER DHEA. ENTITY IN THE CONTRACT OR NINE OF. THE VERY COMPELLING IN TERMS OF HAVING A PRICE IT'S A LETTING IT UP THE OPTION ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK IT'S AT. SO USE IT IS MEANS TO PER ANY THE USER COMPETITOR CONTRACT TERMS LIKE ANTI TEARING AN ANTI STEERING WHERE IT PROHIBITS AN INSURANCE COMPANY FROM FIGHTING. IT'S IN ROLE TO HIGHER VALUE PROVIDERS A LOT OF TIME THESE CONTRACTS PREVENT THEM FROM SIGNALING WHO ARE HIGHER VALUE LOWER. FIGHTERS INTO PROHIBIT THOSE TERMS. YOU CAN ACQUIRE THE BEST OF. ITS OR ABANDONMENT OF THE MERGER ALL TOGETHER. AND THEY CAN ALSO PROVIDE MONEY RELIEF AND IN THE CENTER CASE WHICH- I BELIEVE THEY JUST DELAYED THE REPORTING OF THAT SETTLEMENT. BUT IS SUPPOSED TO BE AROUND FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS SO. ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE GOOD THINGS THAT CAN COME OUT OF THESE CASES. BUT THE POINT I WANT TO MEET THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT HIS VICTORIES IN LITIGATION ARE. THEY'RE GREAT THEY'RE REALLY IMPORTANT BUT THEY ARE NOT THE ONLY THING WE CANNOT DECLARE VICTORY AT THE THOUGHT R. K. AND WALK AWAY FROM WHAT WE SEE IN CALIFORNIA. IT IS. WE TEND. PROP IN ONE. IN WHAT T. REX. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS THAT WE WANT TO DO THAT IN CASES WHERE THINGS GET REALLY BAD BUT YOU ALSO NEED TO HAVE THINGS THAT ADDRESS THE ENTIRETY. OF THE STATE AND- IF YOU THINK HEALTH EDUCATION AS TENDING TO ONE PLANT. TENDS THE TIRE FARM YOU WANT YOUR GET THE ENTIRE FARM ENTRY WELL SO I THINK IN THAT. CASE WE LOOKING. FROM THE WE DO THINGS LITIGATION WE NEED TO LOOK TOWARDS LEGISLATION. AND WHEN WE LOOK ACROSS ALL FIFTY STATES WHAT WE SEE IS THAT STATES ARE. KIND OF COMBINING THERE. EFFORTS ON THE AND LEGISLATIVE SIDE INTO THREE BUCKETS SO THE FIRST IS TARGETING VERY SPECIFIC MARKET IMPERFECTIONS AND THESE ARE.LIKE THE ANY COMPETITOR CONTRACT PROHIBITING THOSE. WORD AN- THINGS LIKE THAT AND THEN ALSO THINGS LIKE SURPRISE BILLING LAWS RIGHT IN TRYING TO. GET VERY. SICK AND IF YOU. GET BUT ALSO TO IMPROVE MARKET FUNCTION AND THIS IS BY INTRODUCED PRICED. INITIATIVES ALL HERE CLAIMS DATABASES AND ALSO ENHANCING THEIR MERGER REVIEW SO IN CALIFORNIA. OUR MERGER REVIEW IN HEALTH CARE IS SORT OF DIVIDED UP DEPENDING ON THE ENTITIES THAT ARE MERGING. IF IT'S NONPROFIT HOSPITALS THE HE LOOKS AT IT IF IT'S DOMESTIC INSURERS CITY I LOOKED AT IT IF IT HEALTH SERVICE HEALTH SERVICE PLAN CMHC LOOKED AT IT. BUT WHAT WE SEE IS THERE. WE DON'T HAVE ANYBODY THAT LOOKS SPECIFICALLY A FOR PROFIT MERGERS WE DON'T HAVE ANYBODY THAT LOOKS. AT WHEN. HEALTH. THERE IS A BEFORE. PROVIDE AND THE WHERE WE'RE SEEING SOME AND WE DON'T HAVE A- NOTICE OF THOSE THINGS. AND SO SOMETHING FOR CALIFORNIA COULD LOOK AT IN ENHANCING ITS MERGER REVIEW PROCESS WOULD BE TO REQUIRE NOTIFICATION TO THE STATE AG AS ALL RIGHT- RHODE ISLAND AND HAWAII HAVE DONE. THEY REQUIRE NOTIFICATION OF ALL TYPES OF HOSPITAL MERGERS. AND THEN IS. IN CONNECTICUT WASHINGTON A MASSACHUSETTS REQUIRE NOTIFICATION OF ANY MATERIAL CHANGE TO THIS INCLUDES A MERGER AND ACQUISITION BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES. THOSE CONTRACT AFFILIATIONS WHICH ARE JUST SHORT OF A MERGER BUT THEY ARE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR NEGOTIATING PURPOSES AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE PAYING ATTENTION TO. THE OTHER THING THAT WE COULD DO IS WHAT RHODE ISLAND AND HAWAII HAVE ALSO DONE TO REQUIRE BOTH NOTIFICATION ALSO APPROVAL OF SOME STATE ENTITY FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF MERGE THEY REQUIRE FOR ALL TYPES OF HOSPITAL MERGERS BUT WE COULD REQUIRE IT- FOR THE GOLD MIND HOSPITALS. AT THAT AND THEN FINALLY WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT MARKET REGULATION IN AREAS WHERE MARKET HAS NOT- WE'RE COMPETITION NO LONGER EXISTS AND YOU COULD THINK ABOUT RATE REVIEW AS THEY HAPPEN RHODE ISLAND. RATE CAPS FOR WRITERS. THAT IS SOMETHING OF INTEREST I INTRODUCING MORE COMPETITION THROUGH A PUBLIC OPTION OR- DIRECT CONTROLLING PRICES THREE SINGLE PAYER. SO OPTIONS CONSIDERATION WOULD BE TO REQUIRE AG NOTIFICATION AND APPROVAL OF ALL HEALTH CARE CONSOLIDATION ACTIVITY- BUT YOU COULD TEAR IT BY LEVEL OF IMPORTANCE ARE POTENTIAL RISK TO COMPETITION. AMENDING THE STATE ANTI TRUST LAW THE CARD RIGHT ACT TO ALLOW THE AG TO CHALLENGE MURDERS IN STATE COURT UNDER STATE LAW AND THEN STRENGTHENING A POST MERGER REVIEW THIRTY THREE YEAR CONSENT DECREE- MONITOR THINGS LIKE THAT. CALIFORNIA HAS LET. THEIR PRICES OVERALL LITIGATION LIKE THIS SUTTER HEALTH CASE ALONE CANNOT MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF ANY COMPETITIVE CONSOLIDATION. AND INCENTIVES LIKE THE INITIATIVES LIKE THE CREATION OF A P. CD'S AND INCREASED- CALIFORNIA AG PRE MERGER OVERSIGHT WILL HELP LIMIT CONSOLIDATION ACROSS THE BOARD. THANK YOU WELCOME. THAT'S GREAT THANKS VERY MUCH YEAH QUESTIONS AND- QUESTION COUPLE QUESTIONS QUESTIONS YOU TALKED ABOUT THE REASON THAT HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE SO HIGH IS HIS AT HIS PRICES SO- ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS OF THE CONSUMER REALLY CAN'T FIND THE PURPOSES RIGHT- AS A WHEN I DID A- TREATMENT PLAN FOR A PATIENT I WAS VERY. VERY CONSCIOUS ABOUT OKAY IS WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST THIS IS WHAT YOUR INSURANCE IN A COVER SO MY PATIENTS NEW UP FRONT WHAT YEAH WHAT. THEIR OUT OF POCKET COSTS IS GOING TO BE THAT DOES NOT HOP HAPPEN WITH WITH MEDICINE AT ALL I CAN'T REMEMBER. HER BEING IN A DOCTOR'S OFFICE FOR THE DOCTOR SAID YEAH THAT'S GOING TO BE THIS OR WHAT. NO VIDAK: OFTEN NOW THEY ARE YEAH THE END AND WAS BECAUSE OF THEIR THEIR AND SO I HAD OLDER SO. RECENTLY I'M STILL WAITING THE BILLS TO COME IN BY IDEA WITH ANYTHING IT'S GOING TO COST- I DIDN'T KNOW THAT I WAS AT IN IT. IN THE COST. YES AND I'M- SURPRISED BUT WE WERE GET IT WE GET THEM IN CALIFORNIA BUT EVEN CHANGES TO THINGS LIKE SURPRISE BILLING. HAS HAD AS YOU SEE ON A NATIONAL LEVEL HAS LED TO ALL SORTS OF- THE WORLD WILL COME TO. AND SORT OF THING AND THAT'S BEEN. THAT'S OF THAT CHANNEL SHOPPER CONSUMERS. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT- SO. SEE TALK ABOUT PRICE INCREASES. THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY. THERE NECESSARILY REFLECT THE NEGOTIATED RATE. PLAN SO WE SEE THE PRICE GOING UP. BY THE PLANS ARE ALSO NEGOTIATING FOR SO I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT YEAH. WHEN I TALK ABOUT PRICES I'M- LARGELY TALK ABOUT THE NEGOTIATED PRICES OKAY NOT JUST. MASTER. BUT LOOK. THINGS ON THAT ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT ACTUALLY SPENDING THE PRICES NEGOTIATED PRICE AT THE DOESN'T IS THAT WAS THAT AND THAT CLEAR TO ME AND I THINK THE SHADOW INCREASE THE SHADOW PRICING- I THINK WE'RE SEEING THAT IN OVERSEE THAT IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA- RATES FOR CERTAIN PROVIDER. I'M WAS BEEN HISTORICALLY LOWER THEY KEEP THEIR A LITTLE BIT LOWER YEAH BUT THE REALITY IS THERE STILL GENERATING PRETTY HUGE PROFITS- COMPARED TO WHAT THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ARE DOING SO THAT'S- THAT IS THAT'S ALSO A DRIVER THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S PRETTY PRETTY FRUSTRATING- YOU MENTIONED- PRIMARY CARE CONSOLIDATION I'D LIKE YOU TO. TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT BECAUSE- IN MY WORLD WE DON'T HAVE WE HAVE WE STRUGGLE TO GET PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS LET LONG TOLERATE THEM SO. CAN YOU TELL ME. JUST THOSE PROVIDERS ARE BECOMING PARTS OF PHYSICIAN GROUPS THAT ARE AND THEN THOSE GROUPS ARE ALSO BEING ACQUIRED BY. LARGER HEALTH SYSTEM SO IT'S MORETHAT BUNCHING OF THEM TOGETHER AND IT'S LARGELY TO HELP THEM OFFER THINGS LIKE IT'S VERY ADVANTAGEOUS FOR THEM BECAUSE IT HELPS THEM WITH THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THEY OFFER THEM. ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD SYSTEM THEY OFFER THEM BUILDING DENS AND EIGHT CAN GROUP THAT TOGETHER BUT THEN THEY NEGOTIATE IS AND HE'S A WHOLE. AND THEN YOU MENTIONED THAT A LOT A LOT OF THESE LITTLE MERGERS OF GROUPS AND THINGS ARE ALL HAPPENING BELOW THE RADAR SO ONE OF THE THINGS YOU MENTIONED. AS A AS A POSSIBILITY FOR SOMETHING TO LOOK AT WOULD BE TO READ REQUIRING IT SHOULD YOU KNOW NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE AND THAT- AND THAT'S A THAT'S A THAT'S A VERY VERY INTERESTING POINT. HANK YOU THAT TO MY WAS ENDING THE TRUCK. WE WENT THROUGH A BILL LAST YEAR RELATED TO- PAY FOR DELAY AND THE F. T. C. AND THE CHALLENGES WE IS THERE. IT IT FEELS IT FEELS LIKE WHEN YOU SEE THE- RELATED TO MERGERS AND YOU SEE THE- THE- THE STRING OF LOSSES THAT THE FTC HAS. THAT THE STACKED AGAINST US AND IS CERTAINLY STACKED AGAINST CONSUMERS AND THAT'S- LOVE TO KNOW HOW WE UNRAVEL THAT SWEATER- QUITE FRANKLY. ALSO I THINK WE'RE DOING A LITTLE BETTER I MEAN WE'RE STARTING TO SEE SOME VICTORIES I THINK WE'RE STARTING TO UNDERSTAND- THROUGH. QUITE HONEST. ADVANCES IN ECONOMIC MODELING OF HEALTH CARE. WE'RE STARTING TO BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN HOW- HORIZONTAL MERGERS WERE ANTI COMPETITIVE AND NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT TRYING TO DO A BETTER JOB OF EXPLAINING MODELING ABOUT WHY VERTICAL. ARE SAID HE THINKS THAT I CANNOT. THE END OF EVERY THAT THAT TOP. THAT THEN WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO. DO BETTER IN THE COURT ROOM GREAT GREAT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS VERY VERY INTERESTING PRESENTATION OF A LOT OF GREAT INFORMATION THANK YOU SO MUCH THANKS. SO OUR. NEXT OUR NEXT PANEL X. IS ACTUALLY WAS ACTUALLY PANEL WE GOT TO HAVE THREE THREE SPEAKERS ON THIS CAN BE LOOKING AT STATE MODELS AND THE COMMISSION'S THEY'RE RELATED TO- LOOKING AT. COST FIRST WILL BE EIGHT GLEN MELNICK- FROM BLUE CROSS OF CALIFORNIA THE CHAIR AND HEALTHCARE FINANCE. THE USC- SCHOOL PUBLIC POLICY SEE PRICE DEPOSITS OF A CALL SIX GIVES ME. FOR THE MASSACHUSETTS HEALTH POLICY MISSION DAVID CELTS. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR- IN THE FROM THE OREGON. HEALTH AUTHORITY JEREMY VAN HE- DIRECTOR TO HELP US IN ANALYTICS DIVISION OREGON HEALTH AUTHORITY. OF POLICE- COME ON UP. SO DOCTOR MOUNT IS GOING TO GIVE US A NO AND HE'S GOING TO. HILL WILL WRAP IT UP AT THE END WITH THE WITH OTHER STATE MODELS AND THEN WE'LL HEAR FROM OUR FOLKS IN. THIS IS IT'S AN AN OREGON. IF YOU NEED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE I THINK IF YOU HAVE YOUR SLIDES ARE ALREADY LOADED THEIR WILL GOOD. IF NOT I CAN'T HELP YOU. THE TECHNICALLY CHALLENGED COMES. THE GOOD MORNING OF THE BLOOD BUILDING PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC POLICY AT USC AND A SENIOR FELLOW AT RAND AND UP MUCH OF MY RESEARCH IS FOCUSED ON IMPROVING THE PERFORMANCE OF HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FOR CONSUMERS I'D LIKE TO THANK DOCTOR WOULD IN THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR HOLDING THIS REALLY CRUCIAL HEARING AND FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO- CONTRIBUTE TO THIS IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICY AREA. AND THREE. WE GO MY COMMENTS TODAY DRAW A PROJECT THAT WAS FUNDED BY THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION AND A REPORT BY MYSELF AND MY COLLEAGUE SUSAN MURKY WHERE WE SUMMARIZE WHAT'S HAPPENING IT FOR OTHER STATES THAT HAVE- COST HEALTHCARE COSTS COMMISSIONS. THESE OTHER STATES HAVE CREATED COMMISSIONS AND THEIR EXPERIENCE SO FAR SHOWS THAT THESE AGENCIES CAN PROVIDE POLICY MAKERS WITH EFFECTIVE MECHANISMS TO SLOW COST GROWTH AND POSSIBLY CHIEF A WHOLE BUNCH OF A BENEFIT IS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE HERE IN ORDER. SLOW GROWTH WAS. IS THE COST. THE COVER. YOU BROUGHT LEAVE THE MILLIONS OF. AS WE HEARD STRAW WITH PREMIUMS IN OUT OF POCKET COSTS. IT WOULD YOU SEE. HELP BUDGET BELIEVE. THE OTHER SERVICE OTHER THAN HAVE OTHER WOULDN'T THE YOU WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIA'S WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND THE NEXT SLIDE ACTUALLY PROVIDES A AND A COUPLE OF THAT USING DATA. LOOK MANY LIVES OF THE FOUR STATES THAT WE LOOK AT USED- BENCHMARKS SUSTAINABLE COST GROWTH BENCHMARKS SO WE'LL IS STRAIGHT HERE FOR EXAMPLE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF. THE PANEL CALIFORNIA'S. FROM FIFTY THREE AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO AROUND SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR ABOUT THIRTY THREE PERCENT. OVER THE TIME PERIOD THE NEXT ROW SHOWS CALIFORNIA'S PREMIUM FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR GREW BY A HUNDRED AND 45% REALLY PREMIUMS ARE GROWING MUCH FASTER THAN GDP UNDERLYING ECONOMIC GROWTH ALL RIGHT THE FOUR STATES THAT WE LOOKED AT ALL HAD SUSTAINABLE. ECONOMIC BENCHMARKS AS THEIR GOAL FOR SPENDING. IF WE FOR THIS EXAMPLE WE SET ALL RIGHT WHAT IF. HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS HAD GROWN AT THE SAME RATE INSTEAD OF A 145% THE GROUP AT 33% OF THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE GRAPH YOU CAN SEE. THAT THAT MEETING 33% BUT IF THE SAVINGS A PREMIUM HAD BEEN PASSED ON TO WORKERS WHICH IS REASONABLE TO ASSUME INC IN TIGHTENING LABOR MARKETS- THEN THEN HOUSEHOLD INCOMES WOULD HAVE GONE UP SUBSTANTIALLY MORE AND SOLVING ONE OF OUR MORE BROAD PROBLEMS WHICH IS STAGNATING INCOME GROWTH AND INCOME INEQUALITY THE EFFECTS OF THESE KINDS OF SAVINGS EVEN BE GREAT I LOOK. THEM RIGHT. NOT ALWAYS FROM A STATES THAT A MIXED APPROACH WORKS BEST ONE THAT COMBINES TARGETS DATA AND ENFORCEMENT AND THAT'S COMPREHENSIVE THAT IT COVERS ALL PIECES OF THE HEALTHCARE COSTS PUZZLE AND NOT JUST ONE PIECE. THE CALIFORNIA'S LUCKY IN THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHERS WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE TODAY HAVE TO LEADERS FROM OTHER PIONEERING STATES TO HERE TO SHARE FIRSTHAND THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE AND GIVE US GUIDANCE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. IN SOMETHING TO THE REVIEWS OF THE STATE'S IS WORTH NOTING SOME WENT OUT WHAT WE OBSERVE SOME COMMON SUCCESSFACTORS. ALL RIGHT THE ROLE IN SETTING OF EXPLICIT BENCHMARKS IF YOU CAN MEASURE IT YOU CAN'T MANAGE IT. ALL RIGHT THE AUTHORITY SOURCE AND ANALYZE DETAILED DATA- AND IN FACT MASSACHUSETTS LEADERS HAVE A CALLER WORKS. MR TILSON AMASSED POLICY COMMISSION SHE'S CONSTANTLY BREAKING TO ME ABOUT HOW COMPREHENSIVE AND GREAT THEIR DATA ARE. YOU CAN LOOK AT EVERYTHING. THANK YOU BYE A COMPLETE PICTURE OF GOING. WHICH YOU MIGHT IS GOING TO BE NO. IF WE'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD. THE NEED FOR INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY COMBINED WITH STAKEHOLDER COLLABORATION AND COOPERATION IS ALSO A THEME THAT WE SAW ACROSS ALL STATES BUT AT THE SAME TIME UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF ENFORCEMENT. AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS IN MEETING THESE TARGETS AND THAT WE REALLY NEED A RANGE OF MECHANISMS BECAUSE AS A PRIOR SPEAKER TALKED ABOUT THE PROFESSOR CAIN. THIS IS A COMPLICATED SYSTEM. DIFFERENT PIECES THEY'RE MOVING. YOU MAY TO DEVELOP POLICIES TO TARGET DIFFERENT THINGS AND SO WE NEED A HYBRID KIND OF APPROACH- TO ADDRESS THESE THINGS. I'LL BE TALKING TO YOU LATER ABOUT TWO OTHER STATES BUT- THAT'S WHAT MY COMMENTS THAT FOR THE- PRODUCTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU DAVID. GREAT GOOD MORNING- IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE THIS MORNING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR INVITING ME OUT HERE TIME FOR YOU TO ALL THE MEMBERS OF THIS TEAM COMMITTEE AND TO ALL OF YOUR STAFF ACTUALLY BEGAN MY WE ARE ALL WORKING IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE IN MASSACHUSETTS AS A CHANNEL LESS- FOR THE SENATE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE- SO I THINK THAT THAT HELPS AND ARM MIKE. BELIEVE THAT STATE. ME REAL LABORATORY. COMES TO INNOVATION A SPECIALLY IN HEALTH POLICY. AND SO JUST WANT TO SAY AT THE OUT WE ARE EXCITED TO BE A RESOURCE TO YOU- AS YOU HAVE BEEN A RESOURCE TO US. STATES CAN LEARN FROM EACH OTHER'S SUCCESSES AND FAILURES SO TODAY I WANT PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON. OUR. THURMOND BUT ALSO JUST WANT TO SAY THE OUTSET AND SAY AGAIN AT THE- IF WE CAN BE REACHED TO YOU ARE BEYOND TODAY'S HEARING PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO REACH OUT- OUT YOUR SEATS. ARE SO THAT'S AND- SUCCESS AMONG STATES. AND I WELL I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT THERE'S NOT ONE RIGHT WAY TO DO THIS- I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF WHAT WE- DOING IN MASSACHUSETTS. CAN BE A DOUBLE. ANY TYPES OF STATES THE SIZE DAY THERE MARKET FROM A STATE AS SMALL AS DELLA TO MEDIUM SIZED STATES IN OREGON IN MASSACHUSETTS TO A STATE OF LARGEST CALIFORNIA SO I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE ABOUT SOME OF THE PRETTY FULL I KIND OF KNOW HOW MANY. CAN LEAD THAT SUCCESS. A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND HERE ABOUT WHY WE DECIDED TO TAKE ON HEALTHCARE COSTS- SO MASSACHUSETTS WAS A FOUR RUNNER- FOR HEALTH CARE JUST REFORM WE PASSED UNIVERSAL ACCESS REFORM IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX. WHICH BECAME A MODEL FOR THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT- AND HAD A LARGE DEAL SUCCESS AND THAT AFTER GETTING. MOST BE THE NIGHT EIGHT POINT FIVE IN SHORT THANK YOU TO HAVE THE LOWEST RATE OF UNINSURED STATE IN THE COUNTRY. HOWEVER A SUBSEQUENT SUCCESS OF THAT ACCESS. THE CHALLENGE OF SUSTAINING KNOW FOURTEEN. CAME EVEN MORE. AS AN ANSWER. ANY MORE OF A CHALLENGE OF NEEDED TO FACE. AND SO WHAT THIS GRAPH HERE SHOWS IS PERSON HELP ACOSTA. IN MASS. IN TWO NINE WERE THE HIGHEST ANY IN THE STATES. YEAH AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED AND WARY MENTION I THINK AT THE BEGINNING THE UNITED STATES HAS OBVIOUSLY THE HIGHEST PER PACK PER PERSON HEALTHCARE COSTS OF ALL DEVELOPED COUNTRIES SO IN TWO THOUSAND NINE MASSACHUSETTS WAS LITERALLY PROBABLY THE MOST EXPENSIVE PLACE ON THE PLANET- TO RECEIVE HEALTHCARE. AND WAS GROWING AT AN UNSUSTAINABLE RATE AND A RATE THAT WAS NOT GOING TO BE AFFORDABLE NOT JUST STATE GOVERNMENT. BUT FOR THE EMPLOYER BUSINESS IS MASSACHUSETTS ESPECIALLY OUR SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE OF OUR ECONOMY FOR FAMILIES AN INDIVIDUAL. FOR ANYONE WHO'S SEEN ANY WAGE GROWTH IN REVENUE GROUP JUST COMPLETELY SWAMPED. RISING HEALTHCARE COSTS. AND SO WE SET. WE NEED TO THIS HEALTHCARE PROP AND PASS ANOTHER BIG OF LEAD TO TRY TO REALLY CREATE A MORE SUSTAINABLE AND AFFORDABLE PATH FOR THE FUTURE SO THAT WE CAN KEEP THIS PROMISE TO OUR RESIDENTS WE SAID WE WANT TO GET HAVE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE BUT IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT. THAT'S NOT COVERAGE AT ALL THAT'S NOT TRUE ACCESS SO IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE WE PASSED A COMPREHENSIVE PIECE OF LEGISLATION. WHICH HAS ADDED CENTER AND ITS ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE THIS IDEA OF THE HEALTH CARE COST GROWTH BENCHMARK. AND THIS IS A TARGET BY WHICH WE ARE SETTING IN LAW- TO TRY TO HAVE TOTAL HEALTHCARE SPENDING GROW ADDED ANNUAL AND MORE SUSTAINABLE RATE. AND AS GLENN MENTIONED WE DO T&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt; THAT- TO WHAT WE PROJECT IN TERMS OF. THE OVERALL GROWTH IN OUR STATE'S ECONOMY IN THE LONG TERM AND THE IDEA THEIR WORDS AGAIN KIND OF THIS CROWDING OUT IDEA. THAT IF HEALTH CARE CAN AND SHOULD GROW. OUT BECAUSE OF THEIR INNOVATION BECAUSE OF INFLATION BECAUSE OF- TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS. BUT SHOULD TO GROW TWICE AS FAST AS EVERYTHING ELSE AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR ABILITY TO MAKE AN ESTIMATES. HI AGAIN AS AN EMPLOYER FAMILY OR GOVERNMENT IN OTHER ELEMENTS WHEN THAT IS GROWING SO MUCH FASTER. THE LAST THING I WOULD DO ON THIS. IS A- STATEMENT THAT WE HAVE HERE. WHICH IS AROUND A YOU KNOW I TRANSPARENT IN INNOVATIVE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR. HELLO. SAVING MONEY AND IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND IMPROVING ACCESS AND REDUCING DISPARITIES INEQUITIES THAT WE KNOW ARE INHERENT IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. WE CAN SAVE MONEY AND TOTALLY COMPROMISE OUR QUALITY AND COMPROMISE OUR ACCESS WE WILL HAVE FAILED AND THAT WILL BE IN CONSISTENT WITH OUR VALUES AS A STATE. SO HOW CAN WE FIND THOSE STRATEGIES TO HAVE. TO YES OVER TIME BUT ACTUALLY THEN BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN AREAS WHERE WE NEED TO AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN HISTOICALLY UNDER INVEST IN LIKE PRIMARY CARE AND THEY HAVE A HEALTH CARE AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER CARE. SO LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THIS IDEA OF THIS BENCHMARK- SO. THIS IS A IT IS A TARGET IT IS NOT A CáC WE CAN EXCEEDED IT IN ANY GIVEN YEAR AND ALSO YOU THAT ACTUALLY HAVE- BUT IT IS SET IN LAW AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT AGAIN WAS TIED INITIAL. DO ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE OF A THREE POINT 6% ANNUAL TARGET. AND THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT AN AMBITIOUS GOAL- EVEN AS LARRY SAID THAT HEALTH CARE COST GROWTH HAVE MODERATED IN RECENT YEARS. FOR MASSACHUSETTS. YOU KNOW WE WERE CLOSE TO DOUBLE DIGIT YEAR OVER YEAR SPENDING GROWTH. AND MASSACHUSETTS HEALTHCARE IS OUR NUMBER ONE EMPLOYER IT'S A SIXTY BILLION DOLLAR A YEAR INDUSTRY- AND SO PERCENTAGE POINTS MATTER- AND ULTIMATELY WHITES HEALTH CARE COST CONTAINMENT IS THAT CHALLENGES ONE PERSON'S. ACOSTA IS ANOTHER ORGANIZATIONS REVENUE THAT THEY COUNT ON FOR DELIVERING THEIR MISSION. AND SO WE WANTED TO BE ABLE TO BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THIS TO HAVE AND IN. BUT IT SHE WILL ARCHITECT TRACKING MONITOR OVER TIME. AND THE LAW ACTUALLY ALLOWED FOR AFTER A COUPLE OF YEARS THAT WE WOULD ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO MOVE TO A MORE AGGRESSIVE TARGET OF THREE POINT 1% TO SAY. HOW DO WE CONTINUE TO. PUSH THE ENVELOPE IN WELL TO GET A SAVINGS OUT OF. NOW THIS IS BECAUSE- THE WAY WE WORK THINKING ABOUT TOTAL HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES THIS IS ALL IN. IT IS THIS WHAT WE SPEND ON THE STATE'S MEDICAID PROGRAM. IT'S EMPLOYER SPONSORED HEALTH INSURANCE IT'S OUR MEDICARE PROGRAM IT IS THE KNACK COSTS THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF OUR PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE. AND IT'S WHAT PEOPLE PAY FOR THEIR COPAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES AND THEIR COST SHARING OUT OF POCKET. OUT ALL OF THAT UP WE TRACK ITS GROWTH MERE OVER HERE. AND THAT IS THAT IS WHAT WE'RE MEASURING SO IT'S A REALLY IT'S A BIG ALL IN NUMBER. AND IMPORTANCE OF THAT IS A COMMON PROBLEM IN HEALTHCARE POLICY WHICH WE OFTEN SOMETIMES CALLED THE BALLOON PROBLEM OR THE WHACK A MOLE PROBLEM THAT IT JUST PUSHY COUNTER JUST. BROKE ONE OF CARE THAT IS REALLY GOOD SOMETHING HAVE. PLACE BEING CURD IT'S NOT. BACK OUT. AND WE REALLY. HAVE BEEN ALL OF YOU. ALL IN AS I SAID BUT WE CAN DO HAVE AN ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM FOR INDIVIDUAL HEALTH SYSTEMS AN INDIVIDUAL HEALTH PLANS INSURANCE COMPANIES TO SAY THAT THEY ARE ALSO ACCOUNTABLE TO TRY TO KEEP HEALTHCARE SPENDING GROWTH TO A MORE SUSTAINABLE RIGHT AND SO EVERY YEAR WE- ARE IDENTIFIED A LIST OF THOSE HEALTHCARE BIG HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS AND HOW INSURANCE COMPANIES WHOSE COSTS GROWTH HAVE EXCEEDED THE BENCHMARK. AND WE CAN I HAVE THE AUTHORITY AT OUR COMMISSION TO A REQUIRE THEM TO TAKE STEPS TO ADDRESS THEIR HEALTHCARE SPENDING GROWTH IN A PUBLIC AND TRANSPARENT AND REPORTED WAY A WHAT WE CALL PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PLAN COULD OTHERWISE WE CALL THE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN BUT REALLY IT THIS IS A- BASICALLY SAYING WE'VE I DON'T THERE'S AN HERE. AND CITY OF. PROVIDE WHEN DID YOU. YOUR HELP STRUCK THE MINE. TRACK AND WE'RE GONNA MINOR WE'RE GOING TO HOLD YOU PUBLIC TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT. I WOULD NOTE HERE THIS IS KIND OF ARC AVAIL TOOL AND WE HAVE NOT HAD TO THIS TOOL WE HAVE HAD IT IN FACT AND WE HAVE GOT THESE LESS WE HAVE GONE THROUGH A WE'VE HAD BACK FORTH WITH HEALTH PLAN AND HEALTH. BUT WE HAVE NOT ACTUALLY TO TAKE THE ADDITIONAL STAFF AND AB ONE THING I WOULD SAY IS THERE IS A SUDDEN FACT A KNOWING WE ARE WHAT. THAT ARE TRACKING AND THERE CAN BE IN MECHANISM THAT WE HAVE FOUND CAN TO IN INFLUENCE BUT WITHOUT TO NECESSARILY THAT IT SOME STUFF. THAT OF IN ASK. CAN CHANGE BEHAVIOR SO AGAIN WE TRY OF THIS NOT NOT AS A AS BUT AS A TO SAY WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER HOWEVER ALL WERE TOWARDS THESE GOALS. I'M NOT. THIS IS AN- WHOLE PROCESS. WALK ALL THE. THIS IS MARK. EVERY YEAR WHERE WE CAN CALL- THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR BIGGEST HEALTH SYSTEMS AND HEALTH PLANS TO COME AND TESTIFY NOT ON LIKE THIS- UNDER OATH- IN A PUBLIC SETTING ABOUT WHAT THEIR ORGANIZATIONS ARE DOING TO TRY TO HELP MEET THE HEALTH CARE COST GROWTH BENCHMARK AND WHERE DO THEY EITHER CHALLENGES AMERICA THEY USE HELP POTENTIAL. AND SO CAN BE. COMMUNITY COM. ABOUT HOW ALL OF US ARE WORKING TOGETHER. TO TRY TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL WE THEN HAVE THE WE ISSUE OUR OWN ANNUAL REPORT THAT DOES DEEPER DIVE INTO SOME OF THOSE AREAS OF SIGNIFICANT YOU KNOW DRIVERS OF HEALTH CARE SPENDING. AND MAKE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TO OUR LEGISLATURE TO OUR ADMINISTRATION AND TO THE MARKET A BIG PART OF THIS- IS AS AN INDEPENDENT AGENTS WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT IN A SECOND- WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE DATA AND INFORMATION TO ALL OF THE MOST IMPORTANT STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE BUDGET. TO MAKE. WHAT THE DATA ALSO. AND HOW CAN WE I REALLY HAVE DATA INFORMS POLICY MAKING NOT ANECDOTE INFORMED POLICY MAKING AND THAT'S A BIG PART OF HAT WE TRY TO ACCOMPLISH. AND THAT CAN CHANGE OVER TIME. AND SO ONCE YOU BUILD THAT INFRASTRUCTURE BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT DATA UNDERSTANDING. AS HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS RAPIDLY CHANGING. THE PROBLEMS THAT WE THINK WE KNOW NOW COULD BE VERY DIFFERENT FROM FOR FIVE YEARS FROM NOW. AND HAVING THIS ABILITY TO NIMBLE AND TO BE FLEXIBLE AND TO GO WHERE THE TREND TAKE US. ALLOWS US TO THEN BE ABLE TO ADAPT OUR POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS YEAR OVER YEAR ALONG WITH A DEADLY CHANGING HEALTHCARE MARK. NOT IN IN IN IN FIGHTING WITH THAT. SO THE HEALTH POLICY COMMISSION IS UP I KNEW STATE AGENCY THAT WAS ESTABLISHED AS PART OF THIS OUGHT TO REALLY. MONITOR AND TO BE THE HUB FOR ALL OF THE ACTIVITIES TO TRY TO HELP US ACHIEVE THE BENCHMARK- IT WAS A NEW STATE AGENCY AT THE TIME AN INDEPENDENT STATE AGENCY. I WAS THE FIRST EMPLOYEE THIS A STATE AGENCY THIS WAS TRULY A START UP- WITH A VERY AMBITIOUS GOAL- BUT I WASN'T IN THE SOUL- I THAT I HAVE A BOARD THAT I WILL. DO THAT IS MADE UP OF APPOINTMENTS BY THE GOVERNOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ON OUR STATE AUDITOR ALL. INDIVIDUALLY CONSTITUTIONALLY ELECTED OFFICERS AND TWO SETS. AND EACH ONE OF THOSE. CAN A POINTS- A CERTAIN NUMBER OF MEMBERS HERE AND THEIR EXPERTISE IS LAID OUT IN LOSS WE HAVE SOMEONE WHO. IS A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN IF SOMEONE WHO IS AN EXPERT ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE EXPERT ON HEALTH COM ECONOMICS- A WORKFORCE EXPERT. AND I DON'T REALLY REFLECT YOU KNOW AYE DIVERSE RANGE OF DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AND EXPERTISE. BUT NOT ONE OF THOSE CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS HAS A MAJORITY OF THE BOARD. AND THE BOARD WAS INITIALLY HAD STAGGERED TERMS AND THE REASON BEHIND THAT WAS TO INSURE. POLITICAL INDEPENDENCE AT IS I'M- PARTISAN STATE AGENCY- AND WE VIEW OUR GOALS AS REALLY BEING FOR THE PUBLIC AND SO I'VE- PUTTING SOME OF THESE KIND OF STRUCTURES IN PLACE- WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR LEGISLATURE AND EXECUTIVE- BUT WE ARE I DO NOT REPORT UP TO THEM- AND IN FACT OUR BOARD HAS SOME LEVEL OF INDEPENDENCE. FROM THAT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE HARD DECISIONS SOMETIMES- AS IS INEVITABLE- WHEN DEALING WITH HEALTH CARE COST CONTAINMENT. I'M ONE LAST THING I WOULD VERY. ON MY BOARD IS THAT THERE IS- STRONG FINANCIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST PROTECTIONS SO OUR BOARD MEMBERS CANNOT BE PEOPLE WHO ARE EMPLOYED BY OUR BIGGEST HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS OR VIGOROUS. HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS AGAIN UNDERSTANDING THAT WE WANT PEOPLE WHO ARE BRINGING THAT LEVEL OF EXPERTISE. BUT NOT NECESSARILY THERE REPRESENTING A PIECE OF THE INDUSTRY THAT WE ARE IN FACT TRUMP. CHANGE OVER TIME IN INFLUENCE BEHAVIOR CHANGE. THAT BEING SAD- I'VE I RECOGNIZE WAS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE. A VERY BROAD A GROUP OF P. INFLUENCE AND HAVE INPUT INTO THE- PROCESS SO THE FIRST THING I DID WAS EXACTLY EXACTLY. AN ADVISORY COUNCIL. AND SO I THIRTY PERSON ADVISER COUNCIL. WELL IT'S NOT THAT THE HOT ASSOCIATION PLANS BUT NURSE AND SO WORKERS AND A LONG TERM CARE AND SENIOR CARE AND CHILL PEDIATRIC HEALTH AND HEALTH EQUITY AND OUR BUSINESS COMMUNITY OUR SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY OUR LIFE SCIENCES COMMUNITY ARE BIOTECH COMMUNITY THE ALL REPRESENTED OUT AS PART OF THIS ADVISORY COUNCIL AND I CAN TELL YOU EVEN SEVEN YEARS INTO THIS I HAVE AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEETING TOMORROW- EVERYONE STILL COME TO THESE MEETINGS TO BE ABLE TO INFLUENCE AND BE A PART OF ARE YOU MAKING PROCESS AT THE WORK AGENCY. ARE NEED TO DO THIS GO YOU DO. AND I REALLY THOUGHT IT WAS THE BILL STATE OLDER UNITY THAT'S BOB AND WE MEET. AND DISCUSS. WHERE ARE STRATEGIC TO BE AWARE SHOULD GO I WON'T WALK ALL OF THIS CAN BE IN YOUR DAD BUT THIS JUST SOME OF OUR BIGGEST I STAKEHOLDER CONSTITUENTS IT SEES. WHO ARE STILL VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS AFTER- AND I WOULD NOTE ESPECIALLY OUR CONSUMER ADVOCATES AND OUR BUSINESS COMMUNITY IS SO STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BECAUSE OF THE CHALLENGES OF AFFORDABILITY. ACTIVATE ITS EVERY SINGLE DAY- YOU KNOW OUR HEALTH CARE FOR ALL GIVEN THE ONGOING CHALLENGES OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY FOR STATES RESIDENTS WE HAVE IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. TO CONTINUE THESE POLICIES. I THINK WHAT'S MOST INTERESTING HERE IS PROBABLY THE LAST YEAR WHICH ARE OUR HOSPITAL. AND OUR MASS MEDICAL SOCIETY WHO BOTH SAY THEY STRONGLY SUPPORT THE OF THE IN THE MSSION OF THE HELP POLICY COMMISSION AND RECOGNIZE THAT THEY TO HAVE TO BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION. IF WE'RE REALLY GONNA HAVE AFFORDABLE ACCESS. TO HEALTH CARE. SO DOES THE HELP COMMISSION ACTUALLY DO ITS WORK I WE'RE NOT A DIRECT REGULATORS WE DON'T SET PRICES WE DON'T SET PRICE CAPS SO HOW DO WE ACTUALLY USE. THE TOOLS AT OUR DISPOSAL TO TRY TO INFLUENCE. BEHAVIOR CHANGE- WITHIN THE MARKET. AND THESE ARE REALLY KIND OF THE FOR TOOLS THAT I LIKE TO THINK ABOUT OF HOW WE ACTUALLY GO ABOUT. I'VE SEEN THAT CHANGE THAT WE WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN WE HAVE RESEARCH REPORTING- TALK WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THE POWER OF DATA A PUTTING DATE OUT OF THE WORLD WE HAVE FOUND THAT. JUST PUTTING TO GET OUT IN THE WORLD CAN GET PROVIDERS AND HEALTH PLANS TO STAND UP AND PAY ATTENTION TO SAY- I THOUGHT I WAS DOING BETTER ON THIS. THEN THEN I ACTUALLY AND ONCE ISEE MYSELF COMPARED TO SOME MY COMPETITORS- THAT'S A REAL WAKE UP CALL I YOU KNOW I THERE'S MORE THAT I COULD BE DOING IN TERMS OF MAYBE REDUCING AVOIDABLE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT USE. OR REDUCING UNNECESSARY TESTING AN IMAGING. OUR WORK CONVENER WE'RE GOVERNMENT BUT WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS TO HELP ME BRING THE PEOPLE TOGETHER THAT ARE. A PART OF THIS COMMUNITY THAT SEE PATIENTS EVERY DAY THAT WORK IN THIS INDUSTRY TO SAY HOW DO WE- COME TOGETHER AND- IDENTIFY THOSE PROBLEMS AND FIND SOLUTIONS. WORK PARTNER WE'VE ACTUALLY MAKE INVESTMENTS WE MADE OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENTS IN GRANTS. I TO COMMUNITY HOSPITALS AND OTHER PROVIDERS IN MASSACHUSETTS. THE TASK NEW pCARE THAT ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS THAT I TALKED ABOUT BEFORE. REALLY TRYING TO IMPROVE CARE IN MANY CASES FAR MOST COMPLEX AND VULNERABLE PATIENTS. WERE DEALING WITH COMPLEX MEDICAL BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL NEEDS BUT IF WE CAN IMPROVE THE CARE OF THOSE POPULATIONS WE CAN SAVE SO MUCH MONEY AND- DO YOU REALLY POSITIVE THINGS AN IMPROVING PEOPLE'S LIVES. AND THEN FINALLY. THE WORLD WATCHED. NAM AND HERE WE ACT IN TERMS OF REALLY THINKING ABOUT- BEAN THE BEAN ON THE SIDE OF. THE FAMILY INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES AND TAX IS THAT OUR TEAM FOR THIS VERY EXPENSIVE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AND I TO FIND HAVER THAT WE THINK IS INCONSISTENT WITH OUR GOALS OF TRYING TO HIT THE BENCH. AND ALSO SOME. A PLAY WHERE ARE TO REALLY DO THE RIGHT THING AND ACHIEVING SUCCESS. I THINK ONE THING I'D WANNA HIGHLIGHT HERE IS THE BENCHMARK ITSELF. IS IT DOESN'T SAVE THE MONEY BUT BECOMES ALL LANDS AND A TOOL BY WHICH THEN YOU CAN A RAIL ALL OF THESE OTHER POLICIES AROUND DO YOU WANT TO DO MORE INTEGRATED CARE YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO YOU DO PRICE TRANSPARENCY YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO YOU MAKE YOUR MARKET FUNCTION BETTER. BY HAVING THIS COMMON GOAL KIND OF AT THE CENTER THAT YOU CAN ADAPT ALL OF THOSE OTHER IDEAS AND POLICIES TO YOUR MARKET TO YOUR STATE. AND THINK ABOUT IT BUT KIND OF HOW THAT ONE CENTRAL PLACE WHERE EVERYONE IS WORKING TOGETHER SAY OKAY WELL WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR US TO MEET THIS GOAL WHERE WOULD WE HAVE TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS AND THAT MAY GET IN CALIFORNIA THAT MESSAGE TO IT'S- COME. THIS FOR PRINCIPLE BY WHICH YOU THEN YOU CAN START TO MAKE ALL OF THOSE QUESTIONS. OUR I KNOW I'M I'M GOING A LITTLE BIT OVER TO. TRY TO BE QUICK CARRIED. BOTH TO HOW WE DONE SO LET ME SHOW YOU SOME RESULTS- SO WE HAD SIX YEARS OF RESULTS AGAINST THE HEALTH CARE COST GROWTH BENCHMARK- THE DOTTED LINE THERE IN THE MIDDLE IS THE BENCHMARK. YOU CAN SEE FOR THE SIX YEARS WE'VE BEEN BELOW INCLUDING THE MOST RECENT YEAR WHERE WE DID HAVE THAT MORE AGGRESSIVE. I THREE POINT 1% TARGET. YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE'S YEARS THAT WE ACTUALLY WENT ABOUT. AS I SAID THIS IS NOT A CáC THERE CAN BE YEARS WHETHER WE GO ABOUT- AND I WILL NOTE. IN ONE OF IN THE YEARS THAT WE WENT ABOVE. I ONE OF THOSE YEARS- OUR STATE EXCHANGE- HAD SOME TOUGH OF. TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES. AND SO WE DECIDED THAT AS A STATE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVEYONE CONTINUED ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE WE PUT PEOPLE ON. A TEMPORARY MEDICAID PROGRAM FOR A YEAR. THAT INCREASE OUR SPENDING THAT YEAR. BUT WE SAID YOU KNOW WHAT ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE IS. MORE IMPORTANT SO LET'S MAKE THAT CHANGE THAT MAKE THAT COMPROMISE. AND THEN ANOTHER YEAR WHICH I THINK IS- AN AREA. I'M GOING VOTE FOR US. IS INJURED. OF DATE OF. I THAT FOR THAT. INTERLOCK THAT ONE DRUG. HAVE BEEN BELOW THIS. BENCHMARK AND I DROPS OF ALL WHICH IS A ONE TIME TO OR FOUR HABITAT. C. AND I THINK ABOUT OF THE- I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THEIR A LOT. READ KEEP MAY JUST. ABOUT THE RE WILL NOT OF THE LESS PRICE OF THAT. WHEN IT WAS FIRST INTERVIEW IN A HUNDRED THOUSAND. I THINK WE'LL DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WAS LIKE YOU WERE- THAT SAVES LIVES AND WILL SAVE US- EXTEND LIVES FOR MANY PEOPLE. A TRUE INNOVATION SO I THINK HERE IS THAT- YOU CAN BE ABOVE THE BENCHMARK BUT YOU MAY BE MAKING INVESTMENTS THAT. UP IN THE- ROOM WHERE YOU CAN BE BOTH OF THE BENCHMARK- AND YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT IN DOT. ALL RIGHT. HOW THERE ARE. OUT OF. THAT KIND OF THREE TRACK TO THE STATES WEARING THOUGH THE BILL DATA WE- KIND OF COMPARING STATES WHICH OTHERS FROM. UP TO TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WHICH IS QUITE OLD- BUT- FROM THAT LAST TRYING TO DAY THAT WE GOT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. CHOOSE A TWO FOURTH LOWEST. TOTAL NEGRO THE STATE THE COUNTRY CALIFORNIA HAVE ATTEMPT. AND WHAT THIS IS MEANT IS THAT- THIS IS LOOKING AT A PROPORTION OF OUR HEALTHCARE SPENDING SPENDING HAS OF COURSE OF TOTAL. AKAN AND THE- ORANGE LINE HERE'S MASSIVE. AND THE BLUE IS YOUR STATES. YOU CAN SEE THAT WE ARE SPENDING MUCH MORE OF OUR ECONOMY OUR ECONOMIC GROWTH R. G. R. GDP ON HEALTHCARE IN THE UNITED STATES FOR A VERY LONG TIME. BUT THAT RATE IS NOW STABILIZE IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND WE'VE ACTUALLY- DOUBLE OF THE UNITED STATES WE'VE SEEN THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY HERE- AND THIS IS- ABOUT PERHAPS MOST EASIEST WAY TO LOOK AT THIS. NOW THIS IS JUST EMPLOYER SPONSORED CARE THIS IS JUST A COMMERCIAL MARKET. A YEAR OVER YEAR GROWTH- MASSACHUSETTS IN ORANGE. THE UNITED STATES AND BELOW. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT EVERY YEAR CENTS TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THAT WARNS LINE HAS BEEN BELOW THE BLUE LINE. MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST. EUROPE YEAR. IN THE UNITED AB. HAS GENERATED. OF DOLLARS ABOUT WHAT OTHER HAVE BEEN IF WE GROWN AT THE U. S. RATE. THAT MEANS THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN INCREASE PREMIUMS. I AM MEANS WAGE GROWTH THAT ACTUALLY WENT TO PEOPLE INTO PEOPLE'S POCKETS ARE RATHER THAN GOING INTO HEALTHCARE- IT'S HARD TO SAY EXACTLY WHAT- BUT FOR THIS EFFORT WHAT THAT TREND LINE WOULD HAVE BEEN. MAYBE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN EXCESS OF THE UNITED STATES AND CONTINUED TREND. UP NONETHELESS THESE ARE GOOD DIRECTIONAL DATA THAT SAYS SOMETHING CHANGED IN OUR ENVIRONMENT IN IN OUR MARKET AROUND TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. THAT IS AFFECTING OUR RESIDENTS. AND WHERE IS THAT OCCURRED- AGAIN KIND OF DIVING BENEATH HERE IT'S REALLY. POSSIBLE REDUCE IN OUR GROWTH NOT BE AS HIGH AS AS THE- STATES. THE NOT TO SAY THAT ARE HOT. APART ARE THEY CONTINUE TO HAVE A VERY POSITIVE MARK IS AND OF. COURSE CONTINUES TO GROUSE DOES NOT NOT. BACK. OUT ON ANY BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY. I KNOW THAT I'VE I'VE I'VE BUT LABOR MY TIME HERE BUT I DO WANT TO JUST HIT A COUPLE MORE QUICK POINTS- ONE IS THAT WE ALSO HAVE A ROLE IN EVALUATING I HEALTHCARE MARKET CHANGES- SO VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT JAMIE WAS SAYING- WE KNOW THAT THE HEALTHCARE MARKET CHANGES IMPACT SPENDING QUALITY. AND WE HAVE A PROCESS WHERE UP BEFORE- THERE CAN BE CHANGES IN. BUYERS ARE PROPOSING EITHER NEW RELATIONSHIPS I KNEW MERGERS NEW ACQUISITIONS NEW JOINT VENTURES NEW OVER CONTRACTING RELATIONSHIPS THEY BEFORE THEY CAN EXECUTE ON THOSE MERGERS ARE THOSE NEW PLANS. THEY HAVE TO GIVE NOTICE TO THE HEALTH POLICY COMMISSION. IT'S A PUBLIC NOTICE WE PUT IT ON OUR WEBSITE AND THEY HAVE TO DETAIL TO US WHAT THEY THINK THE SPENDING IMPACT THE QUALITY PACKED AND THE ACCESS IMPACT IS GOING TO BE FROM THIS PROPOSED TRANSACTION. AND HAVE TO STAY PUBLICLY WHY THEY THINK THIS MEANS. IS IN. SYSTEM WITH ARTICLES OF HITTING THE BENCHMARK AND HOW THE TRAINS WATCHES. OUR EFFORTS TO HIT THIS BENCHMARK AND THOSE ARE PUBLICLY POSTED. BUT WHAT WE THEN DO AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO IS ONCE WE RECEIVE THAT NOTICE I WE ENGAGE IN A REALLY RAPID KIND OF PRE MERGER OF REVIEW. WHERE ACTED WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF GETTING IS NOTICE- WE TALK TO THOSE PROVIDERS AND THEN WE LOOK AT THEIR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION WE LOOK AT THEIR CONTRACTS WE LOOK AT THEIR MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WE LOOK AT THAT DATA. AND WE SAY DO THESE THINGS ALL MATCH UP. IT DOES WHAT THEY'RE SAYING PUBLICLY ABOUT THEIR WHAT THE GOODS IN THE BENEFITS THAT ARE COMING FROM THIS TRANSACTION THEY ACTUALLY MATCH. THEIR OWN INTERNAL DOCUMENTS OUR OWN INTERNAL PLANS OUR OWN INTERNAL CONTRACTS MEMORANDA OF UNDERSTANDING. AND THROUGH THIS REVIEW PROCESS- WHAT WERE INTENDED TO DO IS REALLY BOTH PROVIDE PUBLIC SHOULD PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY THAT WHEN THESE THINGS ARE HAPPENING- BUT ALSO TO TRY TO JUST REALLY MINIMIZE. THE QUOTE QUOTE QUOTE NEGATIVE IMPACTS JAMIE TALK ABOUT. AND ENHANCE THE POSITIVE IMPACT THAT CAN COME FROM SOME OF THESE TRANSACTIONS. AND SO- WE HAVE HAD OVER A HUNDRED OF THESE I KNOW THIS IS TO US I CAN SEE HERE THEY'RE NOT ALL HOT SUMMERS. MANY OF THESE ARE PHYSICIAN OPPOSITION. YOU ARE JOINT VENTURE DIFFER TYPES OF THINGS THAT IS JAMIE WAS ABOUT OFF. UST FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS BUT STILL CAN HAVE AN IMPACT. NOW ALL OF THESE ABOUT A HUNDRED TRANSACTIONS THAT WE REVIEWED. WE DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO AND BASICALLY DO A DEEPER DIVE ON TRANSACTIONS THAT WE THINK ARE GOING TO HAVE A BIG SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. I AM NOT MUCH LONGER THAT CAN BE UPWARDS OF SIXTY EIGHT. YOU THE END. IS A MORE CYCLE. WE'VE ONLY GONE TO THAT FURTHER EXTENDED REVIEW ABOUT THE TIMES SO IT IS A HIGH BAR- BUT IN THAT EXTENDED REVIEW AGAIN THE MERGER CANNOT CLOSE INTEL FINISH OUR REVIEW AN ISSUE OUR PUBLIC REPORT. AND WE HAVE FOUND THAT. GEN ASKING THESE. HAVING A PUBLIC DIALOGUE AROUND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT HAS CHANGE MARKET BEHAVIOR BECAUSE ONE OF PUTS PEOPLE ON THE RECORD TO SAY THIS IS WHAT YOU SAID GOING TO HAPPEN AND THEN WE CAN GO BACK YOU KNOW. TWO THREE YEARS. AND SAY WELL DO WE HAVE. DO WHAT YOU SAID WAS GOING HAPPEN ACTUALLY HAPPEN AND PUT HAVE THAT ON. YOU KNOW UNDER THE KEYS IN PANEL ARE PERJURY THIS IS WHAT THEY SAID THEIR PLANS WORK. WE HAD PEOPLE MAKE VOLUNTARY COMMITMENTS WE RAISE ISSUES WHERE WE SAY HEY WE'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS NEW MERGER BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO IMPORT A HOSPITAL FEES ON TO THIS PHYSICIAN PRACTICE. THAT'S JUST GONNA RESPECT BUT IT'S A REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT THE DELIVERY OF CARE AND THEY SAY YOU KNOW WHAT. WE'RE NOT DO THAT WE COULD JUST NOT THAT WILL COME. YOU CAN US TO THAT. NOT EVEN A- CONSENT TO CREATE JUST VOLUNTARY COMMITMENTS FOR ORGAN WANTING TO LIVE SEE THAT WERE. THESE QUESTIONS INTO IN THE RIGHT THING. WE FEED OUR REPORTS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE SO THAT. WHEN THOSE KEY RISE TO THAT ANTI TRUST VIOLATIONS THAT WE WERE EATING SO MUCH MORE INFORMATION BEYOND JUST ANTI TRUST BUT ALSO. NEW TAXES COME FROM THESE. AND IN A SMALL NUMBER OF. YOU KNOW DO NOT HAVE THE IF TO. IT ALL REPORTS HOW LED PROVIDE ORGANIZATIONS ABANDONING PLANS TO PURSUE A MERGER BECAUSE OUR REPORTS REYES SUCH SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS. ABOUT WHAT THE IMPACTS OF THAT COULD BE. SO WE ALSO HAVE A NEW ROLE IN EVALUATING THE VALUE OF DRUGS I WILL MAYBE SKIP OVER THIS PART IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I CAN TALK. MORE ABOUT ACTUALLY WERE OKAY ON TIME- PLEASE DON'T SKIP OVER THIS ONE. SO I HAVE THANK YOU- I WILL SAY- AND YOU KNOW ONE OF THE- PHARMACEUTICAL SPENDING HAS BEEN A MAJOR DRIVER OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS- AND AS YOU SAID IT'S NOT JUST AT THE RETAIL- CLINIC- WE SEE A IT INCREASE. IN IN THE HOSPITALS AND PLACE IS KIND OF THE MEDICAL PHARMACY SPEND THINGS LIKE ONCOLOGY DRUGS. AND INCREASING AND SO THAT THE DOCTORS HERE THAT WE'RETALKING ABOUT. SMALL ANYMORE I AM IN OUR CAR BOND MARKET IT CAN BE UPWARDS OF BASICALLY ONE IN FOUR DOLLARS OF HEALTHCARE DOLLARS IS GOING A PHARMACY. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS ENTIRE PIE THAT WE NEED TO ALSO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT AND MAKE SURE THAT WERE HOLDING ACCOUNTABLE AND IS PART OF THIS THIS OVERALL COLLECTIVE ACTION WE HAVE BEEN- KIND OF. BEGINNING TO WORK IN THIS AREA AND SO ONE OF THAT ARE KIND OF INITIAL STEPS THAT ARE GOVERNOR PROPOSED ARE LEGISLATURE. ADOPTED LAST YEAR. WAS A PROCESS BY WHICH- WE NOW POLICY COMMISSION WORK WITH OUR STATE MEDICAID PROGRAM. ORDER TO TRY TO GET BETTER VALUE FOR THE FAR MEDICAID PROGRAM. I'M SO THE WAY THAT THIS WORKS REALLY QUICKLY IS THAT I'VE MEDICAID WHICH IS CALLED MASS HEALTH AND NOT USE ITS- NEGOTIATED MANUFACTURE. ON TRYING TO GET A SUPPLEMENTAL READING. AUG MANY HAVE TO PROVIDE UNDER FEDERAL RULES KIND OF A STANDARD REBATE BUT STATES CAN NEGOTIATE GREATER REBATES. AND SO AUTHORIZES OUR MEDICAID PROGRAM TO ENTER INTO THOSE TYPES NEGOTIATIONS. IF THOSE NEGOTIATIONS FAIL- AND THE DRUG IS OF A CERTAIN HIGH COST OR CERTAIN IMPACT OF THE BUDGET. THEN OUR OUR MASS OF PROGRAM CAN THEN IDENTIFY WHAT IT THINKS THE RIGHT VALUE OF THAT DRUG CAN BE CAN HOLD A PUBLIC HEARING. ON THAT DRUGS AND CONTINUE TO GO WITH THE MANUFACTURER ROUND POTENTIAL SUPPLEMENTAL BATES. IF ALL OF THOSE NEGOTIATIONS FAIL- THEN BASICALLY THE MEDICAID PROGRAM REFERS THAT ISSUE THAT DRUG THAT MANUFACTURE TO THE HEALTH POLICY COMMISSION WEAR THEM WE CONDUCT OUR OWN INDEPENDENT OBJECTIVE REVIEW OF THE VALUE AND PRICING OF THAT DRUG- AND SO WE RECEIVED NOTICE NOT SO DISSIMILAR FROM THE PROCESS THAT I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT WHEN I TALK ABOUT. YOU KNOW MERGERS AND PROVIDER CHANGES WE RECEIVE A NOTICE AND THEN WE CAN GET SIGNIFICANT WE CAN GET OUR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION FROM THE MANUFACTURER AROUND THEIR PRICING THEIR BATES- THEIR PRICES IN ARE ONLY. THEY'RE RE AND DEVELOPMENT. ALL OF WHICH THEN I FEEDS INTO OUR OWN OBJECTIVE REVIEW TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND IS THE PRICE OF THIS DRUG ON REASONABLE OR EXCESSIVE IN RELATION TO WHAT WE THINK THE TRUE VALUE OF THE DRUG IS. SO I'LL BE BASICALLY THAT AND SAY WE THINK THAT THIS DRUG IS POTENTIALLY ON REASONABLY ARE ACCEPT CHRIST- THAT TRIGGERS ANOTHER PUBLIC HEARING MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR INFORMATION SHARING BACK AND FORTH. AND THEN FINALLY THE PROCESS AND WITH US BEING ABLE TO MAKE A FINAL DETERMINATION THAT A DRUG IS EXCESSIVELY ARE REASONABLY PRICED. I'M THIS IS OUR AREA FOR THE HOUSEHOLD THE COMMISSION. BUT WE THINK IT IS VERY CONSISTENT. WITH OUR OTHER MARK. FACTORS WERE REALLY. BRING MORE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY TO DO THIS THE END IS. AND FIND YOUR- THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRICING AND VALUE. WE WANT TO THE RIGHT YOU KNOW. AB THAT THE PRICE IS WHAT THE MANUFACTURER HAS PROPOSED- IN RELATION TO THAT OUT. BY MADE YOU AT THAT PRICE IS DOUBLE THE APPLE VALLEY THAT PROVIDED DROUGHT WE KNOW THAT AND UNDER THAT BE TRAINED. ABOUT THAT. IN ORDER TO TOUR THAT. THAT WERE. SOME ARE. WHY SHOULD STATE FOLKS ON HEALTHCARE COSTS FOR THE BILL I THINK I WILL JUST AND REPEATING MANY OF THINGS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN SAID HERE TODAY- FIVE AND THIS IS A TREND THAT WAS I THINK THE VERY SIMILAR SLIDE THAT WHERE YOU SHOWED EARLIER TODAY THIS IS MASSACHUSETTS DATA I HAVE TO IMAGINE IF YOU READ HELP ME DAY YOU WOULD FIND A VERY SIMILAR STORY. EMPLOYEES PREMIUMS ARE GOING UP EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS TO THOSE PREMIUMS ARE GOING UP. CO PAYMENTS AND DEDUCTIBLES ARE GOING OUT AT RAPID RAPID RATES AND WAGE GROWTH AND INFLATION ARE NOT AND SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS JUST LAST AND LAST DOLLARS IN THE HANDS OF OUR FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS TO BE ABLE FOR HELP. AND EVEN IN A VERY HIGH INCOME STATE LIKE MASSACHUSETTS AND EVEN WITH OUR RECENT PROGRESS- WE HAVE WANTED FOR MASSACHUSETTS RESIDENTS TO REPORT THAT THEY DEFERRED NECESSARYHEALTH CARE BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T AFFORD THE COST. WE HAVE ONE IN FIVE MASSACHUSETTS RESIDENTS WHO SAID THEY CAN GET UP TO FILL BECAUSE THEY CAN AFFORD THE COST. I'M CASES WHENCE TELLS OR RATION THEIR PILLS OR SHARE THEIR PILLS WITH ANOTHER FAMILY MEMBER. CONTRIBUTING TO WORSENING HEALTH. THIS IS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT- ULTIMATELY IMPACTS EVERYONE IN THE STATE AND IT ALSO IMPACTS PEOPLE IN IT IN NOT NECESSARILY EQUAL WEIGHTS WE SEE THAT THIS IS MOST IMPACTING OUR LOWER AND MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES- THERE'S ONE BEARING THE BRUNT OF THIS AND SO- YOU. THE RECENT PROGRESS WE'VE MADE I WE LOOKED AT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF WAGE INCREASES BETWEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND WHERE DID ALL THAT MONEY WHERE DID THAT WAGE INCREASE CO. MORE OF THAT WAGE INCREASE WENT INTO HEALTHCARE AND WENT INTO PEOPLE'S POCKETS. AND YOU KNOW I COULD SAY MAYBE THE STORY WOULD BE MUCH WORSE BUT FOR OUR EFFORTS I DO BELIEVE THAT. THIS STORY WOULD BE WORST BY FAR EFFORTS IN RECENT YEARS TO TRY TO CONTROL HEALTHCARE COST GROWTH. BUT THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT AND I'M NOT HERE TO SAY MISSION ACCOMPLISHED I'M BECAUSE THIS IS THIS IS AN URGENT AND GENERATIONAL CHALLENGE IF WE CAN SWIM DOWN TO A REASONABLE DEGREE OVER TIME. THE WORST PART OF THIS DOLLAR THAT MEANS MORE IN THE BLUE PART OF THIS DOLLAR AND THAT MEANS A STRONGER AND HEALTHIER- SOCIETY BEFORE. AND THERE IS TO DO THIS AND TO DO IT ONCE AND TO DO IT STILL PROVIDES INNOVATION THAT STILL PROVIDES ACCESS. AND THAT'S REALLY THE FOUNDATION OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE AND WHAT I HOPE THAT- CALIFORNIA- YOU KNOW ALSO IS INTERESTED IN PURSUING AND WE WILL BE THERE AS A PARTNER IN A RESOURCE EVERY STEP ALONG THE WAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK RATHER THAN QUESTIONS LET'S WAIT UNTIL. PHONE REPAIR FROM BOTH PALACE I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW SOMETHING YOU SAID- DAVID AND I THINK WHICH IS IMPORTANT IF I HEARD IT CORRECTLY AND DOCTOR KING MIGHT BE ABLE TO- CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT YOU SAID ONE IN FOUR PEOPLE IN MASSACHUSETTS. DELAY TREATMENT BECAUSE OF COST BUT I HEARD HER NUMBER CLOSER ONE TO ONE AND TWO. OR. OKAY AND I THINK THAT THE NASH I'M SORRY I THINK THE NATIONAL NUMBER BUT I THINK IT'S. I'M SORRY SO WHERE NEXT BUT IT I THINK IF ONE TWO NOW. SO YOU'VE YOU'VE CUT SO IF YOU'RE WANTING FOR ANMESSAGE. AND TO NATIONAL IS STRUGGLING- YEAH THAT'S A THAT'S AN ADMIRABLE NUMBER IN SOMETHING- THAT THAT'S A LOT MORE THAN I OPENING SO. MUCH APPRECIATED THANK YOU. JEREMY THANK YOU DR- WOULDN'T BY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- FOR THE RECORD IN GERMANY AND HIM THE DIRECTOR OF THE HEALTH POLICY IN ANALYTICS DIVISION FOR THE OREGON HEALTH AUTHORITY- REALLY AN HONOR TO BE HERE EVEN THOUGH- THE BORDERS BETWEEN THE BOARD OF TURNER STATES ONLY A COUPLE HOURS FROM HERE- IT'S FAR- YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE OFTEN I THINK THAT WE'RE SHARING THESE IDEAS ACROSS THE STATE SENATE. EXCITED AND HOPEFUL ROBERT FOR US CONTINUE TO TRACK PROGRESS TOGETHER AND LEARN FROM EACH OTHER OUR GOVERNOR- LIKE DAVID SAID ISRAEL TRUE BELIEVER STATES BEING A PETRI DISHES OF INNOVATION AND DAVID MANY HUGE. I PARTNER AND A REALLY BEEN GRACIOUS HIS TIME AS WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO. EXPLORE THIS IS A STATE AND WANT TO PAY THAT FORWARD AND SO WE'RE HERE. TO HELP AS WE WATCHES FOR AND WE TOO ARE LAUNCHING A CROSSROADS TARGET PROGRAM WE DON'T HAVE THAT- KIND OF. RETROSPECTIVE PERSPECTIVE OF- AND HAS IT WORKED YET THAT AND THE DAVID PROVIDES WERE SORT OF MID STREAM OF LAUNCHING IT AND SO. I WANT TO GIVE YOU A BIT OF BACKGROUND ON OUT I WE DECIDED TO GO THIS DIRECTION- KIND OF WHERE WE'RE AT IN TERMS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS AND WOULD LOVE TO HEAR. YOUR FEEDBACK AND QUESTIONS AS YOU'RE CONSIDERING THIS SO JUST. JUST QUICKLY WITH THE OREGON HEALTH AUTHORITY WILL- IS A UMBRELLA- HEALTH CARE AGENCIES IN TWO THOUSAND NINE. THE LEGISLATURE REORGANIZED THE STATE'S HEALTH VARIOUS HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS INTO ONE AGENCY. YEAH WE'VE BEEN REALLY- IN OREGON- FOR SEVERAL DECADES TRAINED- RUN DOWN OF A COURSE OF GETTING PEOPLE GETTING. READY ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE COVERAGE AND TRYING TO MAKE THAT AFFORDABLE AND HIGH QUALITY. I'M AND HAVE HAVE TRIED AS A STATE TO LEVERAGE EVERY- POLICY TOOL ARE PURCHASING TOOL THAT WE CAN TO TRY TO- REACH THAT. THAT GOAL- IN IN IN- NINE THE LEGISLATURE TOOK A BIG STEP TO SAY LET'S ACTUALLY REORGANIZE ALL OVER HEALTHCARE PROGRAMS AND ONE AGENCY. WITH THAT TRIPLING THE AND- OTHER. BEING LET'S LET'S. ONE VISION FOR A WE'RE GOING TO HEALTHCARE IS A STAY AND THEN USE THE STATE'S VARIOUS. GRAMS AND- AND LEVER TO TRY THAT. ACCOMPLISH THAT. SINCE MEDICAID PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. OUR STATE CATCH. THE DEEPER ALL WILSON. I'M TO SEE RUN HEALTH POLICY AND TEAM WITH THAT WE'RE PERCEIVED. IN MEMBER HEALTH. BOARD WHICH MAKES US A LITTLE BIT UNIQUE. EIGHTY HA IS THE LAW. HELL CARE PURCHASER IN THE STATE OF OREGON- WE DIRECTLY COVER ONE AND THREE OREGONIANS- THE TWO BLUE SLICES HERE ARE. A WHERE WE PROVIDE COVERAGE DIRECTLY- SO MEDIC IT'S THE BIGGEST PROGRAM WITH- 26% OF THE STATE. GETTING CARE THROUGH YOUR HEALTH PLAN OR MAY PRO. PERCENT THE STATE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS GET HEALTH CARE COVERAGE THROUGH A PUBLIC EMPLOYEE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE THAT SERVE BOTH STATE EMPLOYEES WELL AS SOME EDUCATORS AND SOME LOCAL- SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- AND SO THOSE ARE THE AREAS WHERE WE HAVE THE MOST LEVERAGE ON THE MOST TOOLS BUT ABOUT A LOT OF WHAT MIGHT MY TEAM DOES. REALLY TRY TO SET THE OVERALL HEALTH VISION WHERE WHICH TO GET IN THE TWO WE HAVE THE STATE IN TERMS OF- THE STATE PROGRAMS- AS A AS A VEHICLE IF YOU WELL TO TRY TO INFLUENCE THE ENTIRE MARKET AND SO AS AS CASA IS WE'LL TALK. IS FOR THE ANNUAL WELL THE MORE. IS THE SPREAD ARE GROWN OUTSIDE OF STATE PROGRAM I'M REALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE THE TOOLS WE HAVE AS A STATE THROUGH AND FOR THAT SO BLURRY WHAT THE DIRECT CONTROL WELL REALLY TRYING TO GET FURTHER FOR THEIR OVER INTO THE GREEN. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM LIKE MANY STATES WE'VE BEEN. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT TO GET PEOPLE HEALTHCARE COVERAGE FOR A LONG TIME- AND THEN FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THAT AFFORDABLE- AND THANKS IN LARGE PART TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT- WE ARE ABLE TO DECREASE THE UNINSURED RATE IN OREGON FROM ABOUT 15% TO SIX PERCENT- AND THAT'S REMAIN PRETTY STABLE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. ON THE LEGISLATURE'S BUILT ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE I. ADDED SOME ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS- TO EXPAND COVERED FURTHER- BUT LITTLE OVERALL. LEVEL TO STAY PRETTY PEOPLE ABOUT EIGHTY FOUR PERCENT. OUR CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW IS THE COP PRESSURE AND SO WE'RE REALLY WORRIED THAT IF WE DON'T GET COSTS UNDER CONTROL. ORGANISED TO. BACKWARD ORGANISED. THE STARTED BY COVERAGE. YOU MUCH LIKE THE- TALKED ABOUT. YOU KNOW WE'RE STILL. SEATS TO SEE DATA AS WELL AS SORT OF ANECDOTES OF FOLKS SAYING. WORKS OR EXPENSIVE FOR ME TO. PRE AND THEN JUST OUT OF POCKET TO GO TO THE DOCTOR SO THAT'S A- TO ME A PRETTY. THE WAR SIGN OF WE DON'T GET HEALTHCARE COSTS UNDER CONTROL IN PREMIUMS UNDER CONTROL. THEN WE'RE GONNA START TO GO BACKWARDS HERE THIS IS THE SAME CHART DAVID TO SHOW YOU A SECOND AGO IN TERMS OF- PER CAPITA SPENDING GROWTH- I NATIONALLY COMPARING ALL STATES- AND LOOKS LIKE A- VALUES ARE SHOWING UP BUT- ORGAN WAS THE FOURTH HIGHEST- PER CAPITA. GROWTH RATE FROM NINE TO FOURTEEN. THAT TEAL- LINES CALIFORNIA- SO YOU'VE BEEN DOING BETTER THAN US BUT WERE WE'VE BOTH BEEN GROWING. FASTER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. WE ALSO HAVE AN ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE- AND THE STATE I KNOW THAT'S- SOMETHING THAT YOU ALL ARE WORKING ON- AND THAT'S REALLY BEEN. ABLE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO START TO TAKE THIS TYPE OF DATA WHICH WE GET NATIONALLY BUT IT'S PRETTY OUTDATED. AND GET A REAL. MAN FOR. MY WIFE. NO FROM THAT THAT. AND MORE RECENTLY. WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN GROWING AT A RATE OF CLOSER DOT SIX. CHANNEL REALLY JOHN ON FOR. AND ON END OF. AND A- IN THE STATE AND THIS IS ORGAN DAY LIKE DAVID SAID I WOULD SUSPECT THAT IF YOU RAN SOMETHING SIMILAR YOU PROBABLY SEE SIMILAR TRENDS IN CALIFORNIA- THIS IS ALL PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA AND- HAPPY TO SHARE HOW WE DID THIS- IF IT'S HELPFUL BUT- THE TAKE AWAY HERE THIS COMPARES- INCOME- GROWTH FROM TWO THOUSAND TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN COMPARED TO. PREMIUM GROWTH AND THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO GET COVERAGE THROUGH THEIR EMPLOYER SO THIS IS JUST. PRIVATE MARKETS- PREMIUMS WERE THREE TIMES FASTER THAN WAGES- WORKERS CONTRIBUTIONS GROUP FOUR TIMES FASTER THAN WAGES AND DEDUCTIBLES GREW TO FASTER SO. WHAT THIS REALLY A QUITE STEW IS A DOUBLE WHAMMY FOR FAMILIES IN THE STATE. I'M AS PREMIUMS ARE. GROWING AGAIN. THERE'S FEWER DOLLARS FOR EMPLOYERS TO PUT TOWARDS WAGES AND IT. AND THESE ARE. OUR YOU'RE SURE AT OF THEIR OWN POCKET. THOSE COSTS KIND OF WAR THE- AND IN A MORE YEARS FROM TWENTY TEN TO TWENTY SIXTEEN. INCOME GREW FIFTEEN PERCENT SO I AM NOT SURE WHY IT. HASN'T SHOWN A THE- HOUSEHOLD INCOME GROWTH. PERCENT IN ORDER. DEDUCTIBLES FOR SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT. AND THE AVERAGE FAMILY PREMIUM EQUAL 29% OF AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME SO. FROM AMOUNT UP. SORT OF COMPENSATION BENEFITS- TRAPPED IN HEALTH CARE THAT AREN'T GOING TO WAGES. GOING COULD. AND WHAT I HEAR FROM. FROM STATE. RUNNING WITH A WE LOSS PEOPLE BEFORE HOUSING ALLOWS FOR RETIRED THE LAW FOR A THINGS OF THINGS THAT ARE ALSO UNFORTUNATELY THE PICK ISN'T ALL THAT ROSE LOOKING FOR OR FORWARD HEALTH IS X. TO GO FROM ABOUT SEVENTEEN AND A HALF PERCENT OF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT NATIONALLY TODAY TO ABOUT NINETEEN AND A HALF BY TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN AND THAT'S- BASED ON THE AMOUNT IS PROJECTIONS THAT ON AVERAGE HEALTHCARE COSTS WILL GROW FOUR POINT SEVEN PERCENT. PER CENT PER YEAR THAT MAY NOT SOUND ENORMOUS IT'S ALL IT'S A LOT BUT IT IT'S THE KEY HERE IS THAT IT'S GROWING IT'S FASTER THAN ALL THE OTHER ECONOMIC INDICATORS IT'S THROUGH AND WAGES FASTER THAN THE ECONOMY AND SO THAT THAT'S THE PROBLEM IS KEEP THE DELTA BETWEEN TO JUST GETTING BIGGER HERE. THE CMS BREAKS ONE SORT OF WHAT THOSE COSTS DRIVERS ARE IF YOU ABOUT WHAT TOTAL SPENDING IN THE STATE YOU CAN KIND OF BREAK IT INTO TWO THINGS THAT'S THE PRICE OF SERVICES THAT YOU PAY AND IT'S THAT. THE UTILIZATION THE NUMBER OF SERVICES THAT GET PROVIDED YOU COMBINE THOSE TWO YOU HAVE TOTAL SPENDING. YOU CAN ALSO PICK APART- SORT OF THE DEMOGRAPHICS SO HOW MUCH- IS THE RESULT OF AN AGING POPULATION AND THAT'S WHAT THIS PIE CHART THAT SO- I THINK A LOT OF FOLKS- YOU KNOW OFTEN SAY WELL WE'VE GOT AGING POPULATION AND SO THAT'S WHAT'S DRIVING HEALTHCARE COSTS THAT'S ACTUALLY ONLY SEVENTEEN PERCENT. THE BASE COST DRIVER IS PRICE INCREASES YOUR OVER YOUR FIRST FOR SERVICES- ORGAN IN CALIFORNIA HAVE HAD SOME RECENT TRENDS IN THE SPACE THIS SHOWS- THE DIFFERENCE. BETWEEN PRICE AND YOUR POSITION FOR- IT INPATIENT OUTPATIENT SERVICES TOP LINES ARE INCREASE. PRICES AND. IS MISSION WE'RE JUST HERE N. N. O. THE TAKE AWAY HERE THAT WE ACTUALLY BOTH STATES HAVE BEEN DOING A GOOD JOB OF THE YOUR- ASSUMING THAT WAS GOOD DECREASES IN UTILIZATION BUT FOR THAT PRICE HAVE BEEN MORE THAN UP FOR THAT AND SO THAT'S A- A BIG. A BIG CHALLENGE THAT WE BOTH HAVE. EDITION ONLY PRICES VERY VERY DRAMATICALLY- THIS ALSO COMES FROM OUR ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE WE'VE BEEN DOING IT MORE MORE WITH THAT DATABASE- AND THIS COST GROWTH TARGET PROGRAM WILL REALLY TAKE THAT TO THE NEXT LEVEL BUT- ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN DOING IS PUTTING OUT AN ANNUAL REPORT ON. VARIATION AND TYPICAL PRICES- BY A HOSPITAL FACILITY IN THE STATE AND SO JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF. WHAT THAT VARIATIONLOOKS LIKE- A NORMAL DELIVERY AGAIN THIS IS JUST COME FROM MARKET NOT MEDICAID OR MEDICARE ONCE IN A MEDICARE BUT NOT MEDICAID- THE- THE RANGE OF. ALL DELIVERY RANGES FROM THOUSAND DOLLARS TO TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THESE ARE ACTUAL. PAID IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SO. IN ORDER AGAIN PAGE. I DO OF FOUR TIMES THE AMOUNT BASED OFF OF WHAT HOSPITAL FACILITY THEY HAPPEN TO WALK THROUGH. AND THIS IS A REAL THIS IS A REAL CHALLENGE WHEN DEDUCTIBLES ARE NOW GROWING TO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO WHAT'S THE SOLUTION AT LEAST THE SOLUTION IN OREGON THAT WERE WHAT THE WORD MARCHING TOWARDS- LET'S THE SIMILAR TO MET TO MASSACHUSETTS IT'S TO SET THE STATE WIDE. CARE COST GROWTH TARGET MUCH LIKE GLENN SAID AT THE HIS OPENING REMARKS- I THINK OF THIS IS SORT OF STUDYING AND BUDGET TARGET FOR TOTAL HEALTHCARE SPENDING- IN THE STATE. WE DON'T WE DON'T TYPICALLY AND STATES HAVE NOT LOOKED AT WHAT THE TOTAL HEALTHCARE SPENDING AS WE OFTEN LOOK AT WHAT IT IS FOR MEDICAID OR WHAT IS REPUBLICAN. EMPLOYEES BUT WE LOOK AT THOSE ALL ESTA SILOS AND THIS IS REALLY. I THINK ABOUT SETTING A BUDGET TARGET- AND THEN STARTING HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE TO SAY HOW DO WE LIVE WITHIN THAT BUDGET TARGET- I AM MUCH LIKE MY- HI. I'M HOUSEHOLD- MUCH LIKE MY- TEAM WITH AN ORGAN HEALTH AUTHORITY I HAVE A BUDGET I GOT A MANAGE TO- SO I WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT IF I FOR STUDENTS AT A BUDGET AND THEN STARTED A MEASURE MY SPENDING TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER I MEDIAN OR NOT. AND WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING THAT HEALTHCARE SYSTEM SORT OF LET LET- FRANKLY ACTUARIES OFTEN TO THOSE WITH THE HEALTHCARE COSTS GOING TO GROW. WHAT WE ALL. BY OF MY TIME ABOUT PRICE BEING A BIG DRIVER AND JAMIE NOW. STOCK OF THAT IS YOU'LL NOTE THAT WE ARE TAKE WE ARE GOING TO ACOSTA CARE APPROACH AND WE'VE STE. THE WAY WE LANDED ON HIS PROGRAM WAS WE HAD A TASK FORCE AND- TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT WAS CHARGED WITH LOOKING AT. SHE WE CREATE A MARYLAND STYLE HOSPITAL RATE SETTING. UP PROGRAM MARYLAND- SETS HOSPITAL RATES FOR ALL MARKETS. NOT STATEWIDE- WE LOOKED AT THAT AND ULTIMATELY DECIDED THAT WASN'T THE RIGHT COURSE FOR ORGAN FOR A COUPLE REASONS. ONE MARYLAND HAS A WAIVER THAT NOBODY ELSE THINKS THERE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY- EVEN THOUGH- PRICES ARE CHALLENGE EVEN THE HOSPITAL HOSPITAL PRICES IN. RECENT YEARS HAVE REALLY BEEN A CHALLENGE. THERE WAS A BIG CONCERN THAT IF WE FOCUS ONLY ONE PART OF THE SYSTEM. WE MIGHT. OF THE DAY. WE'RE GONNA. FROM NOW TRYING TO CHASE SOME OTHER PROBLEM. WELL MEANWHILE COSTS CONTINUES TO GROW AT THREE OR FOUR FIVE OR SIX PERCENT- SO THE GROUP GROUP DECIDED TO- LOOKED AT WHAT WHAT WHAT MASSACHUSETTS A DONE AND DECIDED TO CREATE THIS- SPENDING TARGET THAT APPLY- TO TOTAL PER CAPITA SPENDING- INCREASES YEAR OVER YEAR AND WILL APPLY. ALL PAIRS AND ALL PROVIDERS IN ALL MARKETS IN THE STATE. GET THE WRONG IDEA HERE IS THAT WE CAN BUILD MORE ON THIS ONCE YOU HAVE THE DATA ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT THE COST DRIVERS. THAT THEIR POLICY THINGS THAT MAYBE EVENTUALLY COMPLEMENT THIS. BUT IF WE DON'T START TO UNDERSTAND WHAT TOTAL SPENDING IS. AND START TO HAVE A COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE THE COST DRIVERS. THEN WE'RE JUST SORT OF. AT THE- SINCE I HERE AT THE CREE UP. REALLY COMMON. OR UNDER ANY PROBLEM ARE. SORT OF IMBALANCE AND THE MORE IS JAMIE MENTIONED EARLIER THERE'S BEEN HUGE CONSOLIDATION. NORMAL MARKET NEGOTIATIONS MARKET DYNAMICS ARE HOLDING COSTS DOWN THEY ARE HOLDING PRICES IN CHECK. AND THE SYSTEM FRANKLY IS FOCUSED ON REVENUE- IT'S SHOOING FOR. INCREASES IN REVENUE OR TRYING TO ITS REVENUE TARGET AND NOT TO SAY THAT THERE ARE. LEGITIMATE CASA UNDERNEATH THAT. BUT WHAT WE'RE FINALLY TRYING TO DO WITH THIS TARGET IS TO CHANGE THE DOSES. IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. LET'S TOWARDS. ENTERS COLLECT WHAT. MEETING A BUDGET THAT WE CAN AFFORD AS A STATE AND WORK BACK FROM THERE AND FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE HOW DO WE DO THAT AND HOW DO WE IMPROVE. VALUE IN IT AS PART OF THAT OVERALL EQUATION. JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF. KIND OF THE SQUEEZING THE BALLOON CHALLENGE THAT WE THAT WE HAVE AND WHY WE THINK THIS TOTAL SPEND APPROACHES. IS RIGHT FOR AGAIN- THIS SHOWS CHANGES IN UTILIZATION A PRICE FOR EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS NATIONALLY SO. TO STILL LOOK TO THE CHART ON THE LEFT- BLEW IS A UTILIZATION GREEN A SPRITE IS THERE IS A LOT OF EMPHASIS. EIGHT EIGHT YEARS OR SO ON GETTING. EMERGE ROOM IT'S THE MOST. PLACE WHERE PEOPLE GO WHEN OFTEN THE SYSTEM BREAKS DOWN AND IN GET. SERVICE AND A BETTER BETTER PLACE WITHIN THE- SO WE GOT LUCKY ONE OF EMERGENCY ROOM IT THEN WE'RE WE'RE GONNA NATIONALLY AND THEN WE'LL HAVE. PRICE RUMORED ROOMS. COULD THE SYSTEM. AND GENTLY IN OUR ERR MODEL THE KNOW IT. ALSO ISN'T LOOK AT TRYING TO OUT HOW TO HOW TO KEEP THIS OVER SPEND WITH AND- A- ASK A SORT COST. COST TARGET. SO WE'LL FOCUS ON CAN'T WORRY PUSH UP. WERE RE PUSH. A HOW DO WE- THE REVENUE TARA THEY WERE SHE FOR AND FOR. THIS SCREEN SHOT ON THE IS FROM LOCAL PORTLAND AREA HOSPITAL I TOOK IT FROM- WEBSITE. THE AD THAT RAN ON THE ON THE SIDE- ADVERTISING FOR THEIR SHORT EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS AND TRYING TO GET MORE PEOPLE IN THERE SO THE SYSTEMS ARE SPOTS THAT'S GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF EMERGENCY ROOM WAS. WE SHOULD GET MORE PEOPLE IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM. IT'S THE WAY I SCRIPT GET YOU KNOW WE REALLY THINK THE CREATES A- GOAL. AND TRYING TO GET PAIRS AND PROVIDERS TOGETHER AND IT IS IT IS ABOUT. ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY BUT THIS IS ALSO ABOUT- COLLABORATION BOTH WITHIN THE HEALTH SYSTEM FIGURE OUT HOW THEY- HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE A GOAL. AND IT'S ALSO AROUND- ON THE ON THE POLICY SIDE HOW DO WE REALLY TRY TO BRING FOLKS TOGETHER ON A COMMON GOAL AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THOSE POLICY LOVERS ARE- THE OLD. FAMILY REDUCED COSTS. SEEN THIS TO ASSIST IN TARGET AND PICKING AN ECONOMIC INDICATOR. THE HEALTH CARE. LINE WITH. I'M THE GENERAL CAN. WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS TO IS TO. CLOSE THAT DELTA NO. HOW THE HELL. FASTENERS THE ECONOMY. I'M WILLING TO TRY. IS JUST ON A- HERE WE HAVE A LOT OF DATA HAVE A DECEMBER HEALTH CARE BUT WE STILL. TO BRING IT TOGETHER TO TOLD. STORY OF WHAT'S GOING ON THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. OUR MEDICAID ACTUARIES ARE OPERATING AROUND WHAT'S GOING ON MEDICAID ARE. INSURANCE ACTUARIES ARE LOOKING WITH HAVING THE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE. THEY ARE TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER. SO I REALLY SEE THIS AS A AS A WAY THAT WE BRING INFORMATION TOGETHER. I'M IN A MORE HOLISTIC FASHION AND BILL INFORM THE PUBLIC AND POLICY MAKERS. I'M AND STAKEHOLDERS- WHAT WERE SEEN AT THE CHALLENGES OF THE DAY- AND THEN AS WE MENTIONED THIS. WEEK WE HOPE THAT METAL ACOSTA. PRO WE DROP OR THIS THEM AND FOCUS FOCUS CHANGING THE WAY THE PAY FOR HEALTH MOVING FROM FEES SERVICE TO TOWARDS MORE TO ACOSTA CARE CON THAT IMPROVE QUALITY AS WELL AND WE'RE GONNA BE LEFT FORCE TO DO THIS SO AT THE TIME IN A MASSACHUSETTS RHODE ISLAND AND- DELAWARE JUMP THE GUN AND THE HOUSE THAT THEY WERE LAUNCHING PROGRAMS- AND THEN CONNECTICUT JUST ANNOUNCED TO THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS AND THEN- THERE'S A BUILT ON WASHINGTON'S WILL. ENSURE FOLKS ARE. THIS CON IS NOT ENTIRELY NEW TO. DATE WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN STUDYING A PER CAPITA TARGET FOR HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES FOR STATE PROGRAMS FOR THE BETTER HALF OF THE LAST DECADE- WE STARTED IN TWENTY TWELVE- BY SETTING A THREE POINT 4% TARGET WITH A- PROGRAM- THE LEGISLATURE THEN EXPANDED THAT TO- PUBLIC PROGRAMS- SO. MUCH LIKE- DAVE THE EXPERIENCE IN MASSACHUSETTS SOME YEARS WE'VE MET THE TARGET SOME YEARS WE HAVEN'T BUT OVERALL WE HAVE REDUCE THE RATE OF GROWTH IN THOSE PROGRAMS. WE'VE GOTTEN FOLKS A LINE AROUND THAT COMMON GOAL WE'VE REALLY STARTED UNDERSTAND DRIVERS- IN THAT- AND INVOKES REALLY FELT LIKE NOW THAT. THAT WE STAND ON THAT AND THE STATE HAS TIED IT FELL. BUT AT THIS TIME COST. GRAMS BEEN SKYROCKETING SO THAT I HERE IS TO IS A LITTLE BIT FOR ON OF SET ONE TARGET NOW THAT APPLY STATEWIDE AND HAD HOLD EVERYBODY ACCOUNTABLE TO THE SAME TARGETS NOT FAIR THAT I'M STATE PROGRAMS ARE TRYING TO REDUCE COSTS- WALL ALL OF OUR HELD A TARGET IF WE WERE. WE ARE SICK. AND WE ARE ABLE TO GROW LET'S JUST SAY AT THREE POINT 4% OUR STATE TARGET- STATEWIDE IF WE REALLY ALL THE TARGET ALL THE- ALL THE MARKETS TO HIT THAT TARGET. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THREE POINT CMS IS FIRST PROJECTING. IS TWENTY NINE BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE COST SELECT NEXT EIGHT YEARS. I REALIZE THIS IS LIKE A ROUNDING ERROR IN THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET- THIS IS A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT AND IN I THINK OF THIS IS LIKE A- A MORTGAGE OR STUDENT LOAN- INTEREST RATE. YOU KNOW BRINGING THAT DOWN A HALF A PERCENT OR SENATE- MAY NOT SEEM LIKE A LOT ANY GIVEN MONTH BUT OVER THE COURSE OF. AND THIRTY YEARS IT'S- NORMAL. SO WITH THE LEAD. IN PASS. LEGISLATION THIS LAST. TO CREATE THIS FOR. AND WE'RE CALLING SUSTAIN HEALTH CARE COSTS GROWTH TARA PROBE IT'S A MOUTHFUL BUT- WE THE LEAST CUT ONE SYLLABLE OUT BY MOVING FROM BENCHMARK TO TARGET- THE LEGISLATION CREATES THE GENERAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE PROGRAM. TO BE RUN WITH AND- THE ORGAN HEALTH OF. WITH OVERSIGHT FOR MORAL POLICY BOARD- AT AT IT IN THE BASIC FRAMEWORK IS EXACTLY WHAT- WHAT MASSACHUSETTS DOES A SET UP TARGET MEASURE AGAINST IT- HAVE A ANNUAL COST HEARING. OF AN ANNUAL COST TRENDS REPORT- BUT THERE'S A LOT OF KEY DECISIONS UNDERNEATH THAT. THE LEGISLATURE. AND IT STAKEHOLDER INPUT ON. CREATED AND IMPLEMENTATION COMMITTEE. EIGHTY THANK. STOOD UP RIGHT NOW THAT'S ME A NUMBER OF THE MORE DETAIL OP. THIS ARE. HOW THE PROGRAM ACTUALLY FUNCTION- I KNOW OF NO OFFENSE TO OUR- OUR FRIENDS ON THE EAST COAST BUT IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT IN OREGON THAT WE- BOTH LEARN FROM WHAT THEY'VE DONE BUT ALSO FOR RECOGNIZE THAT. YOU KNOW THERE'S DIFFERENT MARKET THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE STATE. WANT TO BUILD THING THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE FOR WORK AND I THINK THAT TO DAVID'S POINT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE DOCTOR BULL AND IN THAT SENSE IT DOES NEED TO BE A ONCE. FITS ALL. REQUIRED TO SPEND AN IMPLEMENTATION. TO THE LEGISLATURE IN SEPTEMBER OF THIS YEAR AND THEN THE PROGRAM WILL BEGIN INTO. AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO THEY'RE THEY'RE THIS COMMITTEE IS TASKED WITH THIRTEEN DISCREET DIFFERENT THINGS THEY HAVE TO DO- I WILL GO THROUGH. ALL OF THOSE BUT- TO GIVE YOU A KIND OF A FLAVOR- THEY HAVE TO SET THE INITIAL TARGET AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THE METHODOLOGY IS AND- HOW OFTEN IT GETS UPDATED- THEY'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT DATA WE ORDERED. AS A STATE WHERE DIGITAL DATA WE MIGHT NEED AND- AND- AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT DATA BUT IT'S WHAT THE- WHAT'S THE ANALYSIS THAT WE'RE GONNA DO WHAT WHAT ARE. THE THINGS THAT. MEASURE AND WE'RE- OUT ON IT AND WE FOR. YOUR OUT. WHAT DO. WE HAVE. WILL BE A DAY. BUT THE IN. POLICE STRATEGIES ARE OUR WHOLE IS TRAIN. AND CRAIG A COMMON. IS A BUT ALSO. THAT THERE USED TO BE SOME OF SOMEONE FORCE IN ACCOUNT. MECHANISM OUT THERE IF- IF WE GET TO THE POINT WHERE FOLKS AREN'T ME IN THE TARGET- AND THE- LEGISLATURE IN OREGON- AND THE TASK FORCE THE RICK PERSONALLY RECOMMENDED THIS- TOOK. LOOK MASSACHUSETTS HAS AROUND A PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PLAN BUT WANTED TO SEE IF THERE WAS MORE TOOLS WE CAN BUILD ON IT. IN ADDITION TO THAT. AND THEY GOT IN A FIGHT A LONG TERM GOVERNANCE OF THE PLAN. AND THEN- AND THEN THEY'VE ALSO GOT FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GONNA MEASURE QUALITY AND- AND ACT AND EQUITIES. EQUITY AS WELL. IDEA HERE'S WE DON'T. THIS IS USUALLY ARE TRAINING COSTS. WITHIN THEIR WAITED AND- IN. COME QUALITY. I CERTAINLY DO NOT WANT TO SEE BACK. OR CREATE MORE IN A- IN THE STATE WE HAVE A FORTY WE THE LARGEST TO LAUNCH THE WHOLE PRO WITH THE X. OF THE ENFORCED AT PEACE THE BILL CALLS FOR. THE STAFF THIS COMMITTEE TO SUBMIT A LETTER A BILL IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE- AND LARGELY THAT WAS- BECAUSE THE GROUP REALLY WANTED US TO FIGURE OUT KIND OF WHAT'S OF A LARGER ARRAY OF PRETEND WILL ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS THAT- THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD. WE JUST RUN THROUGH A COUPLE. TENS OF WE'VE MADE TODAY I GUESS STILL IN THE PROCESS OF BUILDING THIS THING AND STUFF A LOT OF WORK AHEAD OF US THIS YEAR- TWO WEEKS AGO THE COMMITTEE MET AND DID. THAT THE TARGET FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS. WINSTON PICK THREE POINT 4% WHICH IS THE TARGET WE HAVE FOR STATE PROGRAMS- AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF DISCUSSION AND EVERYBODY'S SAYING WELL WE'RE NOT GONNA STUDENTS JUST THREE POINT FOUR PERCENT. THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE THEY LANDED- AND THEY ACTUALLY LOOKED AT A WHOLE ARRAY OF ECONOMIC INDICATORS WAGES AND- INFLATION AND SCORE STATE PRODUCT. AND ALL THOSE WERE SORT OF IN THAT TOO. AFTER FOUR RANGE TO THREE POINT FOUR. SEEM LIKE A GOOD STARTING POINT- BUT ALSO- SAID THAT IN FIVE YEARS FOR. THE RESERVE A DEFAULT REDUCTION 23% WITH THE IDEA THAT- A GROUP SIMILAR. TO THIS WILL COME TOGETHER. AND YOUR FIVE AND FIGURE OUT THAT STILL MAKES SENSE SO. I'M STARTING THREE POINT 4% A TRUCK BUT INSTEAD. INSTEAD DOWN OVER TIME. THE TARGET WILL APPLY AT FOUR LEVELS. THANKS BASIS SO. SORT SPENDING THE STATE BY THE BY TOTAL. TO MEET THE TAR OR NOT. WILL MEASURE IT AT THE MAJOR- MARKET LEVEL MEDICAID MEDICARE COMMERCIAL. WILL MEASURED AT THE ENSURE LEVEL SO HOLD HEALTH PLANS THAT SERVE EACH OF THOSE MARKETS. AND THEN ALL MEASURE AT THE PROVIDER LEVEL- THE PROVIDER LEVELS CAN BE THE MOST COMPLICATED AND THERE'S A VARIETY OF WAYS TO DO THAT ME IN IT GETS A LITTLE. COMPLICATED BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT QUE WHICH PATIENTS ATTACHED TO WHICH PER. ADS THAT APPLY AT ALL FOUR LEVELS. OF THE MARK THE SPENDING THAT'S INCLUDED WHICH MARKETS- MEDICAID MEDICARE COMMERCIAL. BOTH FULLY AND- SHARED. NOT THOSE THREE GODDESS ABOUT NINE. TWO PROBABLY A FULL SPENDING A WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS OUT. OF THAT PEOPLES- OVER THE COUNTER SPEND- VA- TRY KERR- INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES YOU KNOW SEPARATE PROGRAMS THAT COUNTIES AROUND LOCAL CORRECTIONS- SO WE LOOKED AT A BUNCH OF THOSE ULTIMATELY OR SIR SHOOTING FOR IF WE CAN GET TO THE NINETY. PRETTY GOOD- AND A LOT OF THE STUFF BE ON THAT'S PROBABLY NOT THE JEWS PROBABLY IS A WITH THE SQUEEZE IN TERMS OF THE EFFORT TO TRY TO. COLLECT THE DATA- WE'RE GONNA INCLUDE THESE THREE MORE ITS ROLE SO GETTING THE- STATE- STATE CORRECTIONS. AS WELL AS OUR STATE PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY- AND- AND Vì ã SPENDING BUT- SOME OTHERS LIKE TRAVEL. MICHAEL WHAT IS CAUGHT WHAT COUNTS TO ALL THEIR X. THIS PROGRAM IS REALLY ABOUT TRYING TO GET THIS. GET AT THE SPENDING THAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND THE ULTIMATELY IMPACTS PREMIUM SO WE- WE TRACK PREMIUMS AND WE EVEN HAVE RATE REVIEW PROCESSES FOR PREMIUMS IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKET. THE CHALLENGES PREMIUMS ONLY REFLECT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN TERMS OF SPENDING ON THE GROUND SO THIS IS REALLY AROUND. THE SPENDING GOING OUT TO PROVIDERS AND INTO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN A GIVEN YEAR- SO THEY'RE SORT OF THREE MAIN BUCKETS THERE'S- ALL OF THE CLAIMS ALL ALL CLAIMS BASED PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS. ALL NON CLAIMS BASED PAYMENTS PROVIDER SO IF THERE'S A QUALITY BONUS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WITH THE PROVIDER- AND THEN WHAT'S CALLED NET CAUGHT. COST OF PATIENT THERE'S NOT COST OF. HEALTH INSURANCE WHICH IS A WALKIE TERM FOR BASICALLY AND- WHAT'S LEFT OVER WITH THE INSURER AT THE END OF THE YEAR AFTER THEY PAID ALL THE CLAIMS WHAT WHETHER I MEAN CAUGHT. MARGIN I KNOW BUT IT IS. THE GROUP AT ALL GREETED FARM REBAY FOR. SO IS THIS TALK ABOUT HER PHARMACY ARE ARE LOWER ISSUE THAT WE DON'T HAVE A FULL LINE OF SIGHT IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT ACTUAL NET COST IS BECAUSE- A CLEAN GETS PAID WITHIN A REBATE COMES BACK AND SO THE IDEAS WILL CLICK WILL START COLLECTING SOME AGGREGATE PHARMACY RELATED INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT THE TRUTH. THIS PHARMACY IS. I'M OVERALL. THE COMMITTEE WILL WRAP UP IN SUPPORT AND SIMPSON THE REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE'S WELL AS- PROPOSE A BILL FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE- AND THEN WE ARE PLANNING TO START- WITH SORT OF A DRY RUN OUR FIRST IT WON'T BE TILL TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND WE KNOW HOW WE DID IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND WE DON'T WANT TO WAIT THAT LONG WE WANT TO GET START TO GET IN THE RHYTHM OF MEASURING COSTING COST TRENDS AND START TO- GET THAT RHYTHM OF HOW DO WE HAVE THOSE COMMUNITY CONVERSATIONS WE PLAN THAT. HAVE ARE FOR ONE. SO THAT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU VERY BOTH YOU- THE GLENN IS GOING TO COME BACK AND- GIVE. A BUT KIND OF A THE OVERVIEW OF THE TO STAY AND THEN WILL THEM ALL OF IT UP FOR. THANK YOU. YEAH IT WAS ONE. OKAY THANK YOU FOR. HELLO AGAIN SO I'M GONNA FILL IN. SO YOU PUT THROUGH A COUPLE OF OTHER STATE. MARYLAND IN RHODE ISLAND SO A REVIEW BRIEFLY THESE TWO OTHER STATES WITH- COMMISSIONS MARYLAND IS CLEARLY THE GRANDFATHER OF ALL STATE COMMISSIONS DATING BACK TO NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO- AND STILL GOING STRONG THE WITH MANY CHANGES AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SAW IN OUR WORD IS THAT ALL OF THESE COMMISSIONS HAVE VICE OVER TIME. I THINK UNLESS IT IS NOT IF WE DO IT HERE WE'RE NOT GOING TO FIGURE OUT IN ADVANCE WHAT THE BEST MODEL AND ALL THE DETAILS ARE KIND OF THING THAT AS WE LEARN LEARN AS WE GO FORWARD- THE RHODE ISLAND IS MORE RECENT BUT IT WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR AND ALSO HAS EVOLVED WITH CHANGES OVER TIME. AS SEVEN COME. BOTH HAVE COME IS APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR- IF YOU HAVE DETAILED QUESTIONS ABOUT MARYLAND WE ACTUALLY HAVE A FORMER COMMISSIONER HERE WITH US TODAY. BOB VERY AND HE COULD PROVIDE A LOT MORE DETAIL THAN I CAN I'M SURE. BOTH HAVE EXTENSIVE DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS WITH SUPPLEMENTAL SUPPORT FOR A SENT THIS ESSENTIAL FUNCTION. AND AGAIN THE THEME OF DATA. JUST KEEP BECOMES CLEARER AND CLEARER- FROM EVERYTHING I HEAR AND READ ABOUT THESE- FUNCTIONS. MARYLAND HAS IT ALL PAY OUR GLOBAL BUDGET SYSTEM FOR HOSPITALS NOW SO THEY SAID A GLOBAL BUDGET. BUT IT FOCUSES ONLY ON HOSPITALS- IT HAS A DIFFERENT SET OF POLISH POLICY FOR RURAL HOSPITALS RECOGNIZING THEIR DIFFERENT SITUATION OTHER FACTORS THAT AFFECT THEM. THE A THERE'S SEVERAL LIMITATIONS ARE CHALLENGES TO- TO- THE GLOBAL BUDGET FOLKSINGER HOSPITALS WELL HOSPITALS ARE THE BIGGEST PIECE ABOUT ONE THIRD IT'S ONLY ONE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE RIGHT AND ALSO SETTING HOSPITAL BUDGETS IS A COMPLEX AND ALSO. EXERCISE OFF WOULD CUT REQUIRING LOTS OF VERY DETAILED DATA ONE SO WHILE THE POLICY ALSO FROM HOSPITALS PROVIDES A MORE STABLE REVENUE SOURCE IT ALSO IS SUBJECT TO THE COMPLEXITY OF HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH FACTORS YOUNG TROLL THE HOSPITAL DOING ADJUSTMENTS. THINGS LIKE THAT. MERYL HOWEVER HAS THE BROADER SCOPE AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER IN TERMS OF THE FACT THAT COVERS MEDICARE AS WELL AS MEDICAID THIS IS DUE TO ITS UNIQUE WAIVER FROM C. EVENTS THAT MOST PEOPLE BELIEVE OTHER STATES WOULD NOT BE WITH ABLE TO. ACHIEVE RHODE ISLAND MODEL IS A HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUM MODEL PLUS AFFORDABILITY STANDARDS SO. INITIALLY THIS MODEL FOCUSES ON REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF PREMIUMS BUT VERY QUICKLY AS YOU STUDY YOU REALIZE IT GOES BENEATH. PREMIUMS TO LOOK AT THE UNDERLYING FACTORS THERE DRIVING PREMIUM GROWTH WHICH IS I THINK ESSENTIAL IF YOU IF YOU IF YOU JUST LOOK AT PREMIUMS LET'S. TRY TO PUT A CAP ON A VOLCANO YOU'RE NOT REALLY LOOKING AT THE FALLING LOVE UNDER THE THAT'S GOING TO PUSH THAT CAP. UP THE COME. THROUGH RULE OF FOR. AND THEY ESTABLISHED A STATE WIDE SPENDING CAP AND- THEY INCLUDE THESE AFFORDABILITY BETTER KIND OF GENERAL LANGUAGE AS I UNDERSTAND IT IN THEIR LEGISLATION. WELL AS THIS GIVES THE ABILITY THE COME TO MAKE BROAD CHANGE THAT FLOW FROM THESE AFFORDABLE FOR AFFORDABILITY LANGUAGE. THAT ALLOWS THEM TO REACH DOWN INTO CONTRACTS BETWEEN HEALTH PLANS AND HOSPITALS FOR EXAMPLE. AND OTHER CHANGES THAT GET AT THE UNDERLYING COST TRENDS THAT ACTUALLY DRIVE PREMIUMS A CLOSING COMMENTS I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF A SET OF COMMENTS HERE. ONE IS IN STUDY THESE OTHER STATES THE NUMBER OF LESSONS OUR CURRENT SYSTEM. NEARLY LACKS TRANSPARENCY AND AS IS LOST COMPETITIVENESS WHICH IS LEADING TO HIGHER PRICES HIGHER SPENDING. SLOWING COST GROWTH WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT. I WITH WITHOUT THE DATA I THINK IMPOSSIBLE. I KNOW IN MY OWN RESEARCH WHEN I PUBLISHED A PAPER THAT SOMEONE DOESN'T LIKE THE FIRST THING THEY SAY IS. YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT DATA. IT'S NOT THE RIGHT TIME PERIOD OR IT'S JUST CALIFORNIA OR WHATEVER BUT WE DON'T WANT THE DEBATE TO BE ABOUT THE DATA. WE NEED GOOD THAT WE NEED TO AGREE ON WHAT WE'RE DOING OUR MEASURING IT. WE WANT TO DEBATE. ABOUT POLICY WHAT TRADE OFFS FOR MEASURING THESE TRADE OFFS CORRECTLY ACCURATELY WITH AGREEDUPON MEASURES. THAT WE CAN OF MEANINGFUL WORTHWHILE DEBATE. ON THE OTHER HAND. WE CAN WAIT FOR EVERYTHING I THE- TO. MOVE FORWARD AS AS STORE GATHERING. START MAKE IT AVAILABLE AND START THIS THIS THIS PATH OF MAKING TRANSPARENCY GREATER FOR OUR SYSTEM. AND THEN FINALLY WE NEED TO DEVELOP. THE BENCH AND BENT BENCH AND TRACK THEM AGAINST MULTIPLE BENCHMARKS RIGHT SO THE IDEA AFFORDABILITY WE LOOK AT FOR EXAMPLE THANKS MORE SORT OF TOTAL HEALTHCARE SPENDING WELL THEY COULD BE DIFFERENT TRENDS FOR DIFFERENT SUBPOPULATIONS MEDICARE MEDICAID- SELF INSURED EMPLOYERS COMMERCIALLY SHORT ALL OF THEM MAYBE STICK TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT TRENDS A DIFFERENT PRESSURE. THEN WE POCKET SPENDING SO WITH MORE COMPREHENSIVE MEASURES OF BOTH COST AND AFFORDABILITY YOU'VE REALLY GOT TO MAKE CHRIS- AND THEN FOR ALSO WE NEED I THINK A STRUCTURE THAT PROVIDES BOTH INDEPENDENCE TO MAKE THESE ARE DECISIONS AND A GREAT DATA TO SUPPORT THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE EASILY ACCEPTED BY EVERYONE. THANK THAT'S COMMENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH IF YOU PLEASE STAY WE'RE GONNA HAVE SO GAVE COME SPEAK TO HE'S GOT A LITTLE BIT CRUNCH BUT- SO MAKING COMFORTABLE STAY THERE THERE'S THREE OTHER CHAIR SIDE. CONFIDENT WILL. FOR ONE THAT WOULD WORSE FOR BUT TO. THANK YOU SO MUCH AFTER A FOR COMING IN. AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME THANK YOU CHAIRMAN WOULD MEMBERS OF THE FOR LAW ME TO HERE TO. AND FOR SUCH IN A ISSUE THAT IS AS WE KNOW INCREASINGLY AN ISSUE FOR CALIFORNIANS AS OF REPORT TO IN THE YOUR COMMITTEES BACKGROUND PAPER IDENTIFIED THE KNOWLEDGE THAT JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO SEAT CF. HOW CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION- DID AN ANNUAL REPORT THE DEMONSTRATES- THAT MORE THAN EIGHT OUT OF TEN CALIFORNIANS CONSIDER HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY EITHER AN EXTREMELY ARE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE TO THEM AND SO THE LINES WITH THIS TIMELY CONVERSATION HERE AND- THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE IS LEGISLATORS- VISION TO REALLY CREATE A MORE AFFORDABLE CALIFORNIA AND THE HEALTH CARE. PART WELL WE KNOW THAT COLOR HAS ENJOY A GRAY ECONOMIC BOOM- WE STILL KNOW THAT PLENTY OF CALIFORNIANS NOT JUST THE MOST VULNERABLE AND MOST IT COME BUT PLENTY OF CALIFORNIANS IN THE MIDDLE. IN THE SQUEEZE AROUND AFFORDABILITY. AND AT THE COST AND AFFORDABILITY OF HEALTH CARE IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF THAT. AND AS DRIVEN DRIVEN- THIS ADMINISTRATION AND MY AGENCY- REALLY LED BY- DR ALICE TEN WHO'S HERE TODAY WITH US AND HER GREAT WORK ON THINKING- AND WORKING WITH A NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT HOW CALIFORNIA CAN ACTUALLY. MOVE THE NEEDLE HERE AND- WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE- YOU KNOW MORE THAN 51% OF CALIFORNIANS ARE MAKING DECISIONS. ABOUT HEALTH CARE BASED ON THE IMPACT WITH COSTS. AND DAD I KNOW THAT PATIENTS THAT I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO TAKE CARE OF AS A PHYSICIAN- DAYS CITY PARKING LOTS OF- DRUGSTORES WONDERING IF THEY SHOULD GET OUT AND ACTUALLY GO PICK UP THEIR INSULIN. OR THEY'RE OUT AND HALLER. BECAUSE THE COPAY OR THE COST OF CARE IS DISK INTO HOT. I THINK CAL SHOULD BE S. LIKE IT IS IN MANY OTHER AREAS OF OUR ECONOMY WHERE THAT ISN'T THE CHOICE THAT OUR NEIGHBORS ARE FACING. AND THAT WE CAN AS A STATE TO BETTER THROUGH THE LEADERSHIP HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND LOCALLY AT IDENTIFYING TO WEAR THOSE LOVERS ARE TO CONTROL THOSE COSTS AND MAKE HEALTH CARE MORE AFFORDABLE. LAST YEAR IN PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR WE DID A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT THINGS TO STABILIZE OUR HEALTH CARE MARKETS IN COVERED CALIFORNIA- WE ADDED THE FIRST IN THE NATION SUBSIDIES TO MIDDLE INCOME CALIFORNIANS- ALLOWING PEOPLE WHO FOR MANY YEARS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN OUT OF REACH FOR JUST UNTHINKABLE. TO GET COVERAGE pINDIVIDUALLY OR FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND AS A RESULT IN THE MOST RECENT NUMBERS WITH COVERED CALIFORNIA WE'VE SEEN OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE- OUTSIDE FOR COVERAGE THAT'S AN INCREASE OF 41% UP FROM LAST YEAR'S NUMBERS THAT HAD MANY OF THE MOVES CALIFORNIA HAS MADE ARE WORKING THAT THESE BOLD STEPS ARE ARE IMPORTANT. BUT STILL THERE'S MORE THAT WE CAN DO. AND THAT LEADS TO- THIS MULTI PRONGED APPROACH THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS RECOMMENDING MANY OF THESE PARTS ARE HIGHLIGHTED AND IN THE BUDGET- PROPOSED BUDGET ARE READY LOOKING AT A SUITE OF ACTIVITIES AROUND PHAM PHARMACY COSTS AND REALLY- HELPING BRING TO THE ESCALATION OF DRUG COSTS- DOWN IN CALIFORNIA WITH IDA PASS THOSE ON TO CONSUMERS WHO ARE TODAY AND TONIGHT GOING TO BE MAKING THAT DECISION AS TO WHETHER THEY WANT TO GO PICK UP THAT EXPENSE MEDICATION. THAT THEY KNOW ME CHANGED THEIR LIFE AND CERTAINLY THEIR HEALTH- TODAY I WANT TO FOCUS ON ONE OTHER PART OF THE PORTABILITY. THE OFFICE OF HELP FORD ABILITY THE ADMINISTRATION GOALS FOR DOING SURE OF FOR. AND THAT IT AND OUR ABILITY TO TRACK AND ADDRESS UNDERLYING DRIVERS OF COSTS IN HEALTHCARE. AND THAT WE MAINTAIN- IN OUR LOOK AT THOSE COSTS A REAL LASER FOCUS ON EQUITY ACCESS AND QUALITY. ARE THE PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN OF THE PROPOSED OFFICE INCLUDE FOUR KEY THINGS SALAS THEM NOW. FIRST SETTING CLEAR OVERALL IN SPECIFIC GROWTH TARGETS. APPLYING THOSE TARGETS TO ALL SECTORS OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM PLANS HOSPITALS PROVIDER GROUPS EXCEPT FOR. CREATING ACCOUNTABILITY THROUGH ENFORCEMENT RANGING FROM TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS TO FINANCIAL PENALTIES. AND ENSURING AND VERY IMPORTANTLY ENSURING THAT THOSE- THOSE SAVINGS GO AND BENEFIT REAL CONSUMERS AND THEIR HOMES TODAY. SO ESTABLISHING THIS OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY IS ONE OF A NUMBER OF STEPS THAT WE'RE TAKING- PROPOSING TO TAKE TO REALLY HELP CALIFORNIA GET A HANDLE ON HEALTHCARE COSTS PART OF THIS BROADER EFFORT TO MAKE CALIFORNIA MORE AFFORDABLE FOR MORE POIGNANT. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATIONS THAT IT WE WILL HAVE YOUR TODAY AND IN THE WEEKS TO COME AS WE TRY TO DO THE BEST WE CAN THE SUPPORT IS CALIFORNIA'S TO HAVE BEEN AFFORDABLE AND GREAT LIFE IS GREAT STATE. I'M I'LL AND WITH THAT AND HAPPY TO THE REST OF THE GROUP AND ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF SECRETARY OF QUESTION IS. FIRST OFF THANK YOU FOR THE FOR YOUR- IN THE- PERSPECTIVE OF THE OF THE- I THINK IT'S THAT WE HEAR THAT AND THAT THEY AND THAT WE KNOW. WE GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE ON THAT- BEFORE YOU GOT HERE MISTER SECRETARY WE HAD- DISCUSSIONS ABOUT- THE MASSACHUSETTS- PLANET OR THE BATHROOM WAS WORKING WITH WORKING IN OREGON AND THAT KIND OF AN OVERVIEW OF MARYLAND AND DELAWARE SO. SO I'M AT A POINT RIGHT TO ASK QUESTIONS YOU'RE WELCOME TO STAY AND LISTEN. OR ASK YOUR OWN IF YOU WISH- THE OKAY. SO I'M GONNA START A AND USUALLY THE ARE GONNA BE FOCUS MORE ON ON ON ON YOU DAY THEN AND SO YOUR YOUR TOP IS- IS THAT THAT NUMBER IT IS ADJUSTABLE OVER TIME IS IT IS IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THAT FAR NUMBER IN LAW THIS WORLD CHANGE OBVIOUSLY- SO IS THAT IS THAT ADJUSTABLE. SO THERE'S TWO WAYS IT IS ADJUSTABLE ONE IS THAT IT IS TIED TO THIS PROJECTION OF LONG TERM ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS ACTUALLY A FRACTION IN ANY BASIS IN THE AND THE BRANCH. THANK GOD THAT HAS THAT CHANGED THAT CHANGED MUST OF YEARS THAT COULD BE SOME THAT CHANGE. IN THE LAW I DOUBT PER DOES PROVIDE THE COMMISSION- SOME FLEXIBILITY TO KIND OF ADJUST THAT BENCHMARK- IN IN THE CURRENT YEAR WE CAN WORK OUR POWERS LIMITED- WE CAN CHANGE OF BETWEEN THREE POINT WERE KIND OF CABINS- BY. STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY TWO. THAT'S NOT THAT LONG INTO THE FUTURE AT THAT POINT THE LAW THEN ALLOW THE COMMISSION AND THE BOARD TO SET THE BENCHMARK AT ANY. AT ANY RATE. AND SO THAT DOES REQUIRE A PUBLIC PROCESS AND INPUT AND ACTUALLY REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. I THINK PART OF THESE WERE A COMPROMISE WERE MADE ALONG THE WAY TO KIND OF OKAY. HOW DO OVER TIME PEOPLE. TRUSTING THE DATA TRUSTING WHAT THIS IS STAN. HOW THE AGE PC MAKES DECISIONS BEFORE KIND OF. COMPLETELY OPENING UP OUR ABILITY TO MAKE THOSE TYPES OF ADJUSTMENTS HI SO KIND OF ESCALATING- FLEXIBILITY. SO YOU WHEN YOU COLLECT THE YOU YOU CAN YOU COLLECT YOU GO TO YOUR PROCESS TO THE YEAR IS THAT- RESULTS OF THAT PUBLIC FOR EXAMPLE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY SEE OR YOU IS OUT ALL KEPT BEHIND THE SCENES SO THAT. OTHER PLAYERS CAN SEE- THEY DID BETTER THAN ME OR OR WHATEVER IS IT OR IS IT IS A- KIND OF HELD TIGHTLY WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION. SO THE ONE PIECE THAT IS CONFIDENTIAL IS THIS IDENTIFICATION OF INDIVIDUAL PROVIDERS IN INDIVIDUAL HEALTH PLANS THAT HAVE IT. I COST GROWTH- ABOVE THE BENCHMARK SO THAT IS THAT IS HELD CONFIDENTIAL ME DO NOT DISCLOSE THE NAMES OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS ON THE LAST. WEEK A LACK TO REQUIRE A PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PLAN. AT THAT POINT THEN THAT ENTITIES NAME PUBLICLY THEIR POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE AND THERE'S A LOT OF PUBLIC PROCESS TO THAT- I THINK THERE ARE WAYS TO. APPROACH AS I SAY THAT. HAVING THAT PROCESS BE. FINANCIAL ALLOW FOR I THINK I UNDERSTANDING THAT IN ONE YEAR WITH ONE MAYBE A SMALL PROVIDER THAT THEIR PATIENT POPULATION CHANGED AND IT'S NOT REALLY THROUGH ANY FAULT OF THEIR OWN THAT THEY ENDED UP ON THAT LIST AND YOU YOU KNOW YOU MAY NOT WANT TO SAY HEY YOU'RE ON THE YOU KNOW THE QUOTE UNQUOTE- NADIE WEST- WHICH IS NOT INTENDED TO BE BUT OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A PERCEPTION THAT IF YOUR NAME PUBLICLY. YOU KNOW YOU YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT COMMITTED TO THE VALUES AND THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE THE CASE AND SO IT DOES ALLOW FOR A LITTLE BIT OF KIND OF A SEEKS A SAFE THOSE COMMERCE TO OCCUR BUT AGAIN IF THE BOARD DETERMINES THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE THERE I A PROBLEM AND THIS ENTITY IS NOT DOING ITS PART OR COULD BE DOING MORE TO CONSTRAIN HELP ACOSTA THEN THERE'S THAT'S PUBLIC AND THERE'S FURTHER ACTION TAKEN. TO MENTION. YOU PARTNER WITH PEOPLE. CAN USE OF GRAN TO HOW. IMPROVE QUALITY WE'RE SOME MONEY COME FROM FOR GRANTS. SO WE ACTUALLY RECEIVED AS PART OF OUR NATIONAL LEGISLATION- AN INFLUX OF OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- BASICALLY FROM- AN ASSESSMENT A ONE TIME ASSESSMENT ON OUR HEALTH PLANS. ARE ARE HEALTH COMPANIES- SO THERE IS A ONE TIME. INVESTMENT THAT WAS PUT INTO A TRUST FUND THAT THAT WE COULD USE. TO DISTRIBUTE- AND GET THE MONEY YOU KNOW. DISTRIBUTE MONEY TO MAKE INVESTMENTS AND HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY CHANGE THE DELIVERY OF CARE- AND HOW WE WORK WITH PROVIDERS TO DO THAT- INCREDIBLE SUCCESS THROUGH THAT THOSE PROGRAMS A- AND FOR PROVIDERS WHO ARE NOT. YES THIS IS. THE BIGGEST SUCCESSFUL. PROVIDERS IS A- PRETTY HOT. IN FAR FOR PARTS OF OUR SMALL. THEY DON'T HAVE AN- TO. YOU KNOW HUGE IN DOWN. OR RESERVES AND SO IS THE WAY IT'S HOW CAN% WE- SERVE TO MAKE SOME INITIAL IN. IN ROLL AWAY. SO THAT'S FROM WE INTEREST RATES OR GAMING IN MASS. RECENTLY AND THE CASINOS HAD TO MAKE A ONE TIME- A LICENSE FEE SOME OF THAT MONEY WAS DIVERTED TECH SO IT WAS A ONE TIME KIND OF. YOU KNOW KIND OF A- INVESTMENT. IN THE FUTURE. SO HAVE YOU. OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW THINKING THINKING YOU KNOW HEALTHCARE IS A VERY- LABOR INTENSIVE- INDUSTRY OBVIOUSLY I MEANING YOU IT'S PRETTY HARD TO DO HEALTH CARE WITHOUT HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS SO DID IN IN THE QUEST FOR PEOPLE TO REACH THEIR BENCHMARKS DID YOU SEE ANY HAVE YOU SEEN ANY KNEE JERK REACTIONS THAT WILL JUST START YOU KNOW WITH CERTAIN SOME STAFF GO TO REDUCE OUR COSTS AND GET INTO THE UNDER THE UNDER THE BENCHMARKS IF YOU DID YOU SEE ANY OF THAT. SO I BECAUSE YOU DID MENTION YEAH- OR SO SOMEWHERE MAYBE SOMEBODY MENTIONED THAT THAT WAGES HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN THAT WAY JUST CONTINUE TO GROW SO I'M CURIOUS DID YOU DID WAS A KNEE JERK REACTION IN SOME IN SOME SECTORS TO JETTISON EMPLOYEES IT UNDER THE AGE MARK. NOW I THINK THERE ARE. CIRCA WHERE INDIVIDUAL PROVIDERS OF HAD TO TAKE. YOU KNOW- MAKE SOME SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS- BUT WHEN YOU LOOK STATEWIDE AND YOU LOOK ACROSS THE ENTIRE SECTOR OUR HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE IS GROUND- OVER THIS PERIOD OF TIME- AND CONTINUES TO BE A BACKBONE OF THIS SO WE DO NOT SEE ANY SYSTEMATIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO AND THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT THE PROVIDERS. NECESSARILY TELLING US. NOW UNDERSTANDING THAT LABOR IS A PRESSURE AND CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT AS IN. A TINY MARKET THERE THERE CERTAINLY ARE RAISING TO US. BUT WE'VE ALSO SEEN OUR WORKFORCE CHANGE- THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THIS TO- WARNER PRACTITIONERS MORE LICENSE CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER. WITH WORKERS CLINICAL AND NON CLICK STAFF ALL WORKING TOGETHER IN MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAMS TO TRY TO BUY CARE SO THAT THE WORKFORCE IS CHANGING AT THE SAME TIME. THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT WE DON'T HAVE A BIG CHALLENGES ESPECIALLY IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE- AND THAT'S SOMETHING AND IN PRIMARY CARE- AND I DO WANT TO MENTION JUST ONE INNOVATION THAT ARE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING. AS WE TAKE THIS EXPERIMENT MOVING FORWARD. HOWEVER HE IS PROPOSING THAT FOR THE NEXT PHASE OF THIS THIS AFTER. THAT WE STILL KEEP OUR THREE POINT 1% ANNUAL TARGET. BUT THE FACT THAT WE ACTUALLY SET SUB TARGETS FOR GROWING SPENDING IN AREAS LIKE PRIMARY CARE AND BEHAVIOR HEALTH CARE. AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN UNDER INVESTED IN HISTORIC. LEGAL YOU HAVE. HOUSE STRONG. ACCESS YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A AND STRONGER SO. WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT EARLY ABOUT THAT ADDED TO THAT OF ALL THE OCCURRING IN THIS IS ONE OF NEW I. THAT IS OUT THERE IS TO SAY IT'S A YES KEEP THE TOTAL TARGET. BUT LET'S TRY TO MAKE SOME INVESTMENTS IN AREAS THAT WE THINK ARE GOING TO PROVIDE THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF VALUE IN THE LONG TERM- SO THOSE ARE THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE OF A NEW INNOVATION AND A NEW EVOLUTION. CAL COULD THINK ABOUT THIS IS YES HAVING. A BIG TARGET- YOU KNOW A BIG STATEWIDE TARGET BUT HAVING AS GLENN SAID THOSE SUB PAR GET SICK YOU'RE TRACKING WHERE THE DOLLARS GOING WHERE. WHERE ARE THOSE INVESTMENTS HAPPY AND THERE ARE THEY GOING IN THE PLACES WE MOST WANT THEM TO. WE THOUGHT A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY TO BEGINNING WAS IMPORTANT. BUT OVER TIME I THINK THE SCIENCE AND EVIDENCE A SHOWN. I AREAS LIKE THEIR HEALTHCARE AND PRIMARY CARE UNLESS. UNLESS SOMETHING ABOUT THE SYSTEM CHANGES THERE JUST NEVER GONNA GET THAT KIND OF MONEY THAT DESERVE. WELL AND I THINK WE- WORLD. THAT OTHERS OTHERS. CAN AND SYSTEMS THAT HAVE I'M A UNIFIED PUBLICLY FINANCED HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. HAVE MORE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS MORE MENTAL HEALTH MORE THE SOCIAL SAFETY NETS. WHICH IS LEADING TO HIGHER AND BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR LESS MONEY. AND SO I AM I'M ENCOURAGED THAT THAT YOU'RE THAT THAT YOU'RE AS THE USE A STATE OF BEGINNING TO FOCUS ON THAT ONE WORK. I. ON THAT I UNDERSTAND MR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE MUCH APPRECIATED YOUR YOU TALK TO PRE. REVIEWS SO WHEN YOU YOU ARE YOU KIND OF OVER. YOU'RE YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE THINGS THAT- JAMIE WAS TALKING ABOUT YES- WITH THE MERGERS AND THOSE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS- CAN GO ALL THE WAY. TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT'S CORRECT. OKAY ANY MENTION DRUG REVIEW SO- WHICH I. ASKED TO CONTINUE ON THAT BECAUSE I WAS COMING IN PORTLAND ME. HOWDY HOW OF THESE HAVE THESE WORKED OUT- WHERE DO THEY WERE THESE END UP GOING YOU KNOW- WE THINK OF I THINK OF YOU KNOW I JUST YOU YOU MENTIONED YOU MENTIONED THE SPIKE IN COST THIS OF ALL THE- I THINK OF THE HIGH COST IT SEEMS TO BE RATHER SUSTAIN AND CONTINUE TO GROW RUN INSULIN YEAH- SO WHEN YOU'VE DONE THESE INFORMATION GO AND WHAT'S THE OUTCOME THAT MIGHT. SO I'M- WE HAVE NOT HAD ONE OF THESE OF THESE THAT WE LITERALLY JUST GOT THIS AUTHORIZATION. OUT LAST AND THE END OF LAST YEAR WE'VE JUST PUT FORWARD OUR REGULATIONS AND SO ON THIS IS STILL NEW FOR US SO I WILL BE HAPPY TO REPORT BACK. TO YOU ABOUT HOW THIS GOES I AND I WOULD LIKE TO JUST SAY TO KIND OF MAYBE HAVE IT AND ADD TO THAT- WE DO. THINK THAT- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE ALL THE DIFFERENT PIECES OF THE PIPE UNDERNEATH THIS TENT I'M- AFTER AND THAT WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT. IN THE IN THE LEGISLATION- THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY WAS WAS EXTENSIVELY INCLUDED IN THIS WAY PROVIDE. A PLAN. IN AND I JUST NEED THE FACTORS I REALLY MEAN KIND OF THE END. SO CHAIN FROM THE MAN. TO THE PD. TO WHOLESALE. WE REALLY SUFFER FROM A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY ACROSS THAT ENTIRE- CONTINUE ON- AND I AND HAVE REAL CONCERNS ABOUT ARMY- ARE ARE WE TRULY GETTING VALUE OUT OF EVERY PIECE OF THAT. AND SO- AGAIN- AS WE THINK IT KIND OF NEXT EVOLUTION OR- IF I WAS TO GIVE YOU SOME ADVICE ON SOMETHING THAT WASN'T NECESSARILY ON OUR RADAR TWO THOUSAND ALTHOUGH IT'S VERY MUCH ON OUR RADAR TODAY. THIS IS A WE MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT IMPORTANT SEGMENTS OF THE BY ARE BEING HELD TO. THE SAME STANDARD TIME PARENTS CANNOT BE. AND HOW TO GET AND WROTE IN THE STATE IRAQ. YEAH ONE PIECE IS GOING IN COME. FROM DIRECT. WE'RE NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. BUT WE DON'T BOUNCE WAY BECAUSE ONE. NATION ME THAT BY BEING. AND I'M SIXTY. EIGHT MEN OUT ARE WASTED. ABOUT THAT YOU CAN ACHIEVE MORE GOALS. THANK YOU FIX MUCH. SO JEREMY. DO YOU SEE IF YOU SEEN SOME OF THE. OUR NATION'S. IN YOUR THAT HAVE LED TO. THE MAIN YOUR YOUR CAR OF. OR YOU KNOW YOU GROWTH RATE WAS CERTAIN HI THAN CAL. SO WHAT IT WHAT WILL WHAT WAS FUELING WAS FEW THAT AND AGAIN AND WHAT WHAT DO YOU AT WITH YOUR WITH THE NEW. AUTHORITY THAT YOU YOU KNOW. IF FRANKLY I THINK LOOK AT THAT TWO THOUSAND TO TWENTY. DID THIS DESTROY IS WITHOUT A COST GROWTH TARGET PROGRAM WE'RE COLLECTING MORE DETAILED DATA WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WAS FEELING THAT- AND SO ARE OUR HOPE IS THAT GOING FORWARD WE WILL UNDERSTAND YEAR AFTER YEAR- WHAT IS WHAT IS. REALLY PART OF THAT RIGHT NOW SIX AND A HALF PERCENT OF. THREE POINT 4% OR LESS GOING FORWARD WHAT IT REALLY IS UNDERNEATH THAT THE HOOD THERE- AT. WE HAVE A WE DO HAVE A FAIRLY HIGH- THE CONSOLIDATED MARKET- YOU KNOW I THINK. IT'S BEEN LEFT IT'S LESS SO THAT IT'S OCCURRED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND MORE SO HAPPENED BEFORE- BEFORE THAT- WE- WE DEFINITELY SEEN SOME CONSOLIDATE AND WE STILL HAVE- YOU KNOW. IT IT'S A LITTLE IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO COMPARE ITSELF NATIONALLY BECAUSE LIKE EVERYTHING'S CONSOLIDATED. SO WHAT LEVEL OF EXTREME CONSOLIDATION ARE YOU- SO WE'RE NOT AS EXTREMELY CONSOLIDATED IN THE PORTLAND AREA AS MAYBE SOME OTHER PLACES BUT WORSE THAN SOME OTHERS. BUT OUTSIDE THE PORTLAND AREA LARGELY IT'S ONE. HOSPITAL COMMUNITIES AND IN A LOT OF THOSE COMMUNITIES THEY HAVE ACQUIRED- THE LOCAL PROVIDER GROUP- AND SO THEY DO OPERATE IN LARGE PART. AND IT IS NOT UNIVERSAL THAN A LARGE PARTS OF THIS. IS A HEALTH. HAS AS MEDICAL GROUP IN THE AND THE X. SEVERAL HOSP IT. INDEPENDENCE RIGHT AREAS SO I. HAVEN'T SEEN AS MUCH OF A SELECTION AND WE'LL SEE YOU. I'M IT. STARTED CONSOLIDATED ESPECIALLY OUTSIDE. SO YOU DON'T SEE THIS IN OF CARE IN RURAL FOR LARGE WE ASK DO WE ASK DO PRICE ANNIE THIS IS WHERE WITHOUT PROBABLY THE OF AT OCCURRED IF I'M WRONG PRICES ARE LOW LOWER IN THE PORTLAND AREA WHERE WE DO HAVE COMPETITION- AND THEY GET HIGHER AND HIGHER AS YOU GET FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY FROM THE PORTLAND AREA TO RURAL COMMUNITIES SO THAT THE COSTS ARE DEFINITELY HIGHER AND THE RURAL COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW AND SOME OF THAT IS. YOU KNOW SERVICE DELIVERY IS MORE EXPENSIVE IN SOME PARTS OF THIS COMMUNITY SO WE HAVEN'T REALLY LOOKED UNDER THE HOOD TO SAY WHY EXACTLY BUT WE DO RECOGNIZE EVERYBODY SORT OF STARTING FROM A DIFFERENT POINT- BUT GOING FORWARD EVERY THE IDEAS OF WHAT HE'S GONNA BE HELD AT THE SAME TARGET AND THAT WE THEN UNDERSTAND MORE AND MORE OVER TIME WHAT DRIVERS UNDER THE HOOD SO WE CAN EVALUATE MORE POLICY OPTIONS POTENTIALLY FOR WHAT WE DO COLLECTIVELY TO GET THAT THOSE COSTS- AND I WILL JUST SAY I THINK. THAT IS AN AREA WE HAVE TO IS THE UNITY OF THE HAS GOT SO WE'RE GONNA I HIGHLY ANTICIPATED WILL MAKING SURE WE ARE READING ABOUT ANY SORT OF AN INTENT TO QUINCY LAND ROLE COMMUNITY- ME WE'VE GOT VERY HERE PARTS OF THE STATE- FOLKS. YOU'VE GOT PARTS OF CALIFORNIA SIMILAR THE RHINO VERY FROM AND SO THE MARKET DAM ARE JUST VERY DIFFERENT THAN IN THE POOR AREA SO ONE OF THE ONE OF THE REASONS WE LIKE THIS GROWTH TARGET A PRO IS IT IS RECOGNIZE EACH COMMUNITIES COMING TO THE TABLES WITH A SORT OF DIFFERENT SET OF DYNAMICS HAVE YOU KNOW THAT MAKE IT TO THEIR AFFILIATED WITH SOME HAVE SIGNIFICANT PROVIDER SHORTAGES AND ALL OF THEM HAVE PROVIDER CHALLENGES BUT THEY'RE NOT THE ANSWER THE SAME IN EVERY COMMUNITY SO RECOGNIZE AND EVERYBODY'S DIFFERENT SET OF CONTACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. WILL NOT GET IN THE WAY OF THE WORLD COMMITTED TO A GOAL RIGHT WE'VE GOT A REDUCED THE RATE OF GROWTH AND READ THE THERE DIFFERENT CHALLENGE COMMUNITY AND IT'S ALSO. GET THEIR ARE YOU CAN GET THERE BY PRICES YOU GET THEIR I. VALLEY AND TRY. THINGS YOU FOR THE US. I WOULD JUST THAT I THINK ONE OF THE YOU KNOW ONE THAT. THE BENCHMARK THE GO MENTAL PRESENTS IS THAT THERE IS ENOUGH MONEY PLAYING FIELD TO BE WITH THAT DIFFERENT PROVIDERS ARE PAID DIFFERENTLY FOR PROVIDING THE EXACT SAME TYPES OF SERVICES SIMILAR TYPES OF PATIENTS. AND A LOT OF THAT VARIATION IS DRIVEN BY THEIR MARKET LEVERAGE. SO ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE'VE WE'VE SOUGHT TO ADDRESS THIS THOUGH. IS THAT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING WHEN WE'RE AT THE KIND OF THE- ENFORCEMENT STAGE WHEN WE'RE CONSIDERING AN ENTITY. FOR OP PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PLAN WE REALLY LOOK AT THAT THE HOLD. SIR CONTACTS OF THAT ORGAN XIN. AND SO YOU COULD SEE IT WE HAVE HAD CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE YOU KNOW IF THIS IS A HISTORICALLY LIKE VERY LOW PRICED PROVIDER. THAT TREATS YOU KNOW A LOT OF PUBLIC PATIENTS IN IN A REALLY VULNERABLE PART OF OUR STATE. AND THEIR COST GROWTH WAS FOUR PERCENT. WE MAY THINK VERY DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THAT PROVIDER THAN HISTORICALLY VERY HIGH PRICE PROVIDER THAT- ONLY TREATS COMMERCIAL PATIENTS AND WAS YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW. DOING EXCESSIVE MANAGING ADJUSTING I'M I'M I'M KIND OF. USE A HYPOTHETICAL HERE BUT THE CONTEXT HOURS HERE AND SO ARE THOSE ARE FACTORED THAT CAN. BEAR INTO THE JUST OF WHETHER A PERFORMANCE IN PLAN. IS WARRANTED OR NOT IT'S NOT A CLEAR FORMULA THAT JUST SAYS AX PLUS WHITE WE'LL SEE. YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT ARE THESE ORGANIZATIONS WHERE THEY SITUATE WHAT POPULATIONS TODAY SIR WHAT ARE THEY DOING AND- HOW THEY MAY PASSED INVESTMENTS AND ALL THIS CAN GO INTO KIND OF THIS THIS KIND OF REVIEW. AND AS I SAID- EVEN HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH ENTITIES WITH PROVIDERS- CAN CHANGE BEHAVIOR IN AND OF ITSELF- BECAUSE THEY SAY THAT'S A THAT'S AN INTERESTING I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT. LOOKING AT MY OWN ORGANIZATION THAT WAY I CAN SEE WHERE THAT MIGHT BE. WHAT YOU KNOW TROUBLING- IN TERMS OF THE GREATER GOAL OF MEETING THE BENCHMARK AND SO. I GET WHETHER YOU BUILD THAT AND KIND OF THE OUTSIDER WHERE YOU HAVE AN OF THE FOOT. IN REVIEW IN THE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES YOU WANT YOU WANT TO BRING IT BACK THAT CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION. BECAUSE WE DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. SO MASSACHUSETTS IS A IS A INDEPENDENT AND ORGANISE UNDER THE OREGON HEALTH AUTHORITY MARYLAND AND DELAWARE ARE COMING. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES THEREUNDER SO. SO THREE THREE TO ONE HERE- ON THAT SO I BUT I YOU KNOW I I'M CURIOUS I'M CURIOUS- BUT PERSONALLY I WILL I WILL SAY I HAVE A BIAS I'M AYE I WOULD PREFER TO SEE AN INDEPENDENT ENTITY- I THINK IT WOULD BE IT KEEPS THE POLITICS OUT OF IT- ULTIMATELY RECOMMENDATIONS WE HAVE AN LA- WE HAVE A RIDE WHICH ARE NON PARTISAN- BUT THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S A THAT'S A PERSONAL PERSONAL BIAS- IS OR AGAIN. HARD FAST ON ON STATE WITH THEIR OR IS IT JUST IT JUST THE WAY OUR SYSTEM WORKS- THE AT THE WAY THE LEGISLATION IS RIGHT NOW ISN'T IT SAYS IT WILL BE RUN BY- HA IN COLLABORATION WITH- WITH THE C. B. S. A SEPARATE AGENCY THAT DOES OUR INSURANCE REGULATION- AND WITH OVERSIGHT FROM THIS. THIS BOARD WHICH IS A GOVERNOR APPOINTED- BUT IS- CITIZEN BOARD THAT'S THAT'S LAID OFF WITH INDEPENDENT- AND SINCE THEY ARE. EMPLOYEES OF THE AGENCY- IT'S THAT'S A LOS THAT LEGISLATION RIGHT NOW IN THE IN THE GROUP DOES HAVE TO COME UP WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S PLANS OF THEIR SUMMERS MAYBE THEY COME BACK WITH SOMETHING. DIFFERENT THAN THAT BUT I THINK THERE'S ALSO THE CHALLENGE OF WE'VE CONSOLIDATE EVERYTHING UNDER ONE AGENCY IF WE START SPLITTING STUFF APART THEN THERE'S PROBABLY F. ACOSTA THAT AS WELL RIGHT SO WE'VE GOT ALL OF A LOT OF THE DATA. ALREADY IN HOUSE WITHIN THE AGENCY- I ACTUALLY THIS IS A OPPORTUNITY REALLY BUILT OF THAT AND DO MORE WITH- AND SO I THINK THERE WOULD BE A RISK OF A- SHOULD SAY WITH. STATE INTO SEPARATE AGENCY BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE I CAN ALSO SEE THE VALUE AND- AND REALLY HAPPENED SOMEBODY WHO'S COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT FROM. YOU KNOW HAVING OPERATE THE PROGRAM WHICH HAS ITS OWN SEPARATE SET OF CHALLENGES- SO I YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S PROS AND CONS- EITHER WAY IT JUST HAPPENS THAT IN OREGON WE FOR A SORT OF CONSOLIDATE ALL THE PROGRAMS AND SO. THE STARTING POINT FOR THE CONVERSATION HAD. JACKSON BLESSING WHAT'S INCLUDED THERE. THE THOUGHTS ON THAT ONE. YEAH ONE UP IS A YOU HAVE A GOVERNMENT AID. BUT THE YOU HAVE IN. COME RIGHT WHO ARE MAYBE NOT SO. YOU KNOW KIND OF LIKE A MIXED WHERE YOU KNOW YOU YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE COMING IS ALL THESE INDEPENDENT EXPERTS- BUT ARE NOT PART OF THE INDUSTRY- SO THAT WAY YOU KIND OF. HAVE BOTH. YEAH I THINK THERE'S YOU KNOW TO BE CLEAR WORK GOVERNMENT AGENCY- SO I THINK THERE'S- DIFFERENT FLAVORS OF THE SAME THING HERE- YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW ONE OF THE KIND OF- STRAIGHT FROM OUR FROM WHAT WE'VE DONE IS. AS GLENN SAID OUR COMMISSIONERS HAVE THIS CONFLICT OF INTEREST SO ON THE BOARD MEMBERS ARE REALLY THERE- NOT TO DRIVE THEIR OWN PERSONAL AGENDAS NOT TO DRIVE AN AGENDA OF AN ORGANIZATION THAT'S THAT'S FINE AND- REALLY THEY'RE JUST. HOW CAN WE BE A PART OF THIS BOARD AND IMPROVE CARE FOR THE PUBLIC OF THE OF THE STATE AND REALLY BRING THAT NOT LENDS TO IT AND I'M A HAPPY. ON THERE ARE NONE. HOWEVER YOU DID OF HAVING OF A BOARD THIS. IS IT ALL IS JUST ON WAY OF A BUILDING TRANSPARENCY AND- TRUST BECAUSE- PEOPLE WE ALL OF OUR WERE MEANS ARE PUBLIC AND PEOPLE CAN SEE OUR BOARD MEMBERS. BOB WRESTLE WITH THESE ISSUES AND DISAGREE SOMETIMES AND I THINK THAT ACTUALLY. ENGENDERS AN ABILITY TO SAY- I CAN SEE THAT THIS BOARD IS STRUGGLING WITH DIFFICULT DECISIONS AND THAT THIS IS NOT SOME TYPE OF LIKE. IT'S ALL KIND OF PRE ARRANGED IN SOME PRE ROOM AND THEN COME OUT LIKE THIS IS A REAL TIME INACTION KIND OF LIKE. YOU KNOW HOW TO BE WRESTLE WITH THESE- TRADE OFFS ON DIFFERENT THINGS AND- IN THE SEVEN YEARS THAT WE'VE- DINNER. AT THAT AGENCY- WE'VE PROBABLY AVERAGE. I DO THE MATH ON THIS THREE PUBLIC MEETINGS A MONTH FOR SEVEN YEARS. AND WE STILL GET- YOU KNOW OVER YOU KNOW HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE THAT COULD COME TO OUR MEETING ARE WATCH ONLINE. SO THE AMOUNT OF ENGAGEMENT THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO. AND THEN STILL THAT PUBLIC I HER. CONTINUES TO COME OF A HOT WE ALL IN THIS THIS THAT WHEN WE DO MAKE DECISIONS. WE DISAGREE WITH YOU KNOW THAT CONCLUSION BUT THEY CAN'T AGREE WITH A PROCESSES THE DATA OR THE METHODOLOGY WE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I TO IF ANY OF MY- MEMBERS SELECT HAVE THE COMMENTS ARE. OKAY THANK YOU VERY VERY VERY MUCH YOUR WE'VE GOT TO COME MORE SPEAKERS IN BUT I REALLY AND WE WILL TAKE YOU UP ON YOUR OFFER OF A AS RESOURCE I CAN GUARANTEE THAT. THANK YOU. SO WE HAVE- CHERYL DAM BERG ARE CHAIR AND HEALTHCARE POLICY IN PRINCIPLE SENIOR ADVISER FOR THE RAND CORPORATION AND- CHRISTINE I'VE NEVER I THINK YOU SHOULD COME IS CHRISTINE COMING UP WITH THE WITH YOU AS WELL GREAT THANK YOU- THE DIRECTOR PAYMENT COSTING COVERAGE PROGRAM FOR ALSO WITH THE RAND CORPORATION SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I LOVE IT WHEN TECHNOLOGY WERE SO WONDERFUL. THANK YOU THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT HERE TODAY- YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OF GREAT PRESENTATIONS FROM VARIOUS SPEAKERS TODAY ABOUT- THERE IS COST PROBLEMS ARE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS FACING THE VARIOUS COST DRIVERS AND THEN THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THE STRATEGIES TO TRY TO ADDRESS THOSE AND ACTUALLY- CHRISTINE EISNER WHO'S MY COLLEAGUE GET RANDALL BE TALKING- IN MORE DETAIL ABOUT SOME OF THOSE STRATEGIES- BUT I THINK THE ONE COMMON THEME THAT YOU'VE HEARD THROUGHOUT THE MORNING. IS THE ABILITY TO MAKE PROGRESS ON THE COST FRONT- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS PREDICATED ON HAVING GOOD DATA TO INFORM POLICY MAKING AND SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS GIVE- A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE SEES AND THEN TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE HEALTH CARE PAYMENT DATABASE THAT'S BEING ESTABLISHED YEAR CAL. SEC MISTER BRIEFLY IS BACK ON OF WHAT IS AN OLD CLAIM STATE OF A SO WHAT THE DATABASE THAT TO DO AS TO PULL DATE FROM BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SOURCES OF INFORMATION SO WHETHER THAT'S- MEDICARE OR MEDICAID- PRIVATE INSURERS- AND IT INCLUDES DATA OF A VARIETY OF SOURCES- INCLUDING MEDICAL PHARMACY AND DENTAL CLAIMS. AND IMPORTANTLY BECAUSE TO STUDY THESE PROBLEMS- IT'S CRITICAL TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC PROVIDERS WHETHER THEY BE HOSPITALS POSITIONS PHYSICIAN GROUPS- SKATED NURSING FACILITIES AND SO ON- ONE NEEDS TO HAVE GOOD UNDERLYING- FILES THAT CONTAIN PROVIDERS IN THE ABILITY TO TRACK THOSE PROVIDERS OVER TIME. AS WELL AS THE PATIENTS TREATED BY THOSE PROVDE. AND ALL THIS INFORMATION AS REPORTED IN TWO A CENTRAL REPOSITORY UP. TO RUN A STATE. SO CURRENTLY THERE ARE SEVENTEEN STATES HAVE ALL HERE BECAUSE DATA IS AND OR IN THE OF AND THEM AND- CAL. THE RE WHY HAVE IN THE DIRECTION OF FORMING AT ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE SEES IS THAT MANY OF THE DAY YOU THAT- DIFFERENT ENTITIES HAVE USED HISTORICALLY. I HAVE RELIED ON WHAT  CALL- PRIVATE POOLING OF DATA- SO THERE ARE THESE PRIVATE FIRMS OUT THERE WHO MAYBE HAVE AMASSED A PRIVATE CLAIMS DATA- OR- PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS MEDICARE DATA BUT- FREQUENTLY WHEN ONE LOOKS AT THOSE DATA YOU'RE LOOKING WITH IN SILOS AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO LOOK ACROSS THE OTHER ISSUE WITH- SOME OF THESE VOLUNTARY REPORTING EFFORTS IS THAT. TYPICALLY THEY ONLY INCLUDE TO UPDATE ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUBMITTERS AND THEY OFTEN RESTRICT AT USE OF THE DATA SO ALL HERE CLAIMS DATABASE SEIZE REALLY TRY TO MOVE BEYOND SOME OF THESE UNDERLYING PROBLEMS BY HAVING DATA FROM MOST OR ALL OF THE STATE'S INSURERS AND THEY ALSO HAVE THE BENEFIT OF MOVING BEYOND SOME OF THE CURRENT EFFORTS THAT EXIST I CALIFORNIA SUCH AS WITH OSCAR COLLECTING DATA ON HOSPITAL DISCHARGES- BY. INCLUDING THE CARE THAT'S PROVIDED ACROSS ALL SITES OF CARE- RATHER THAN JUST HOSPITALIZATIONS AND ANOTHER BENEFIT IS THAT- THEY TYPICALLY HAVE MUCH LARGER SAMPLE SIZES SO- WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT WHEN YOU'RE DEVELOPING ESTIMATES OF A PROVIDERS- LET'S SAY QUALITY PERFORMANCE- YOU NEED TO HAVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS TO BE ABLE TO GET A RELIABLE ESTIMATE- AND SO. LARGER SAMPLES ENABLE THAT- THEY ALSO HAVE BROADER GEOGRAPHIC REPRESENTATION AND THE OTHER THING THAT'S CRITICAL AS WE TRY TO THINK ABOUT MEASURING COST TRENDS AND CHANGES OVER TIME IS THE ABILITY TO HAVE LONGITUDINAL INFORMATION- ON BOTH INDIVIDUALS AND PROVIDERS- BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE HEALTH CARE MARKET PLACE IS VERY DYNAMIC- PEOPLE SWITCH HEALTH PLANS THEY SWITCH PROVIDERS. AND THE ABILITY TO TRACK THEM OVER TIME AND UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM AS A FUNCTION OF THOSE SWITCHES IS ALSO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. SO I THINK ALL OF YOU KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA'S MOVING DOWN THE PATH- AS A FUNCTION OF AB EIGHTEEN TEN- AB EIGHTEEN TEN ESTABLISHED- THE HEALTH CARE COSTS. TRANSPARENCY DATABASE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE OPERATIONAL BY JULY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND THE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO INFORM POLICY DECISIONS REGARDING- HEALTH CARE COSTS- THE ABILITY TO. BETTER UNDERSTAND AND REDUCE- HEALTH CARE DISPARITIES AND ALSO TO TRY TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY. ROUGHLY ELEVEN MONTHS AUSTIN HAS CONVENED A REVIEW COMMITTEE% AND FULL DISCLOSURE I WAS THE VICE CHAIR OF THAT COMMITTEE- AND- THIS COMMITTEE WAS THAT I HAD- REPRESENTATIVES FROM ALL ACROSS THE DIFFERENT SECTORS- OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEY PROVIDED INPUT- AND I'M GONNA SPEAK TO SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS LATER IN MY PRESENTATION- RELATED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE DATABASE AND AGAIN IF I COULD LEAVE YOU WITH ONE AND- TAKE AWAY. THIS A P. C. D. THAT'S BEING FORMED IN CALIFORNIA IT IS A NECESSARY TOOL TO SUPPORT THE PROPOSED- CALIFORNIA OFFICE ON AFFORDABILITY. SO THINKING ABOUT HOW THIS DATABASE CAN BE USED- RELATED TO COST CONTAINMENT EFFORTS- CLEARLY- IT'S I WILL ENABLE OUR- AT THE WORK IN TERMS OF TRACKING TRENDS AND SPENDING- WE CAN LOOK AT VARIATION AND COST. OF CARE AND- SOME OF THE FACTORS INFLUENCING THE VARIATION COSTS- WE CAN LOOK AT THE EFFECTIVE PROVIDER CONSOLIDATION- WE CAN ALSO LOOK AT WAYS FULL HEALTH HEALTH CARE SPENDING- AS WE TRIED TO- BAND THAT- COST CURVE- THE OTHER. IMPORTANT THING- CALIFORNIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN A LEADER AND- THERE IS HEALTH CARE REFORMS- AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OF THOSE HEALTH CARE REFORMS PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF PAYMENT POLICY- IS ANOTHER CRITICAL- USE OF THE DATA WE'VE ARE. ARE HEARD THE MORNING ABOUT PRIMARY CARE SPENDING AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IS THE SHARE OF TOTAL SPENDING GIVEN THAT WE KNOW PRIMARY CARE IS IMPORTANT- NOT ONLY FOR PROVIDING- HIGH QUALITY CARE TO PEOPLE BUT ALSO CONTROLLING SPENDING. AND THEN LASTLY- POTENTIALLY THE USE- OF THIS INFORMATION FOR MAKING- COSTS TRANSPARENT TO CONSUMERS. SO THE H. B. D. BEYOND COST CAN ALSO ANSWER OTHER KINDS OF CRITICAL QUESTIONS THE POLICY MAKERS HAVE- SO WE'VE ALREADY TALKED TO PROVIDE ABOUT PROVIDER CONSOLIDATION- WE WANT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THE UTILIZATION OF CARE CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO PAYMENT CHANGES- WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND UTILIZATION OF SERVICES AND HOW THOSE DIFFER ACROSS DIFFERENT PATIENT POPULATIONS. AGAIN PLAYING TO THE ISSUE OF DISPARITIES- WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE QUALITY OF CARE IS AND HOW THAT FAIRIES FOR- DIFFERENT PATIENT POPULATIONS AS WELL AS ACROSS DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROVIDERS- I'VE ALREADY MENTIONED- THE ISSUE OF DISPARITIES UNDERSTANDING THE SOCIAL RISK FACTORS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH QUALITY PERFORMANCE. AND WHETHER DISPARITIES ARE SHRINKING ARE GROWING OVER TIME AND RELATED TO COST QUESTION AND THIS GETS TO SOME OF- THE EARLIER SPEAKERS COMMENTS OUT. HEALTH WE HAVE THE ABILITY HERE TO LEVERAGE THESE DATA TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER SOME PROVIDERS ARE MORE EFFICIENT AND DELIVERING QUALITY THAN OTHERS. SO BRIEF HOW SOME OF THE STATES YOU ARE A P. C. D. SO I'M I'M GOING TO BRING TOUCH ON A- OF SO THAT HAVE BEEN DONE SO IN VIRGINIA THERE WAS A STUDY THAT DEMONSTRATED- THERE WAS- FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF LOW VALUE CARE SERVICES THAT DON'T PROVIDE BENEFIT TO PATIENTS. DELIVERED IN MINNESOTA THEY HAVE TRACKED TRENDS AND PRESCRIPTION DRUG SPENDING. BOB AND IN UTAH AND COLORADO THEY LOOKED AT INSURANCE TRANSITIONS AND WHAT HAPPENS TO PATIENTS AS THEY TRANCE. EXCUSE ME TRANSITION IN A LOT OF MEDICAID- SO. THREE IMPORTANT USE CASES- ANOTHER USE CASE- THAT I WOULD BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION BECAUSE OF THE EMPHASIS ON MARKET CONSOLIDATION. SO MY GROUP AT RAND HAS BEEN LEVERAGING- MEDICARE DATA- AND THE DATA SHOWN ON THE SLIDE ARE ONLY THE MEDICARE DATA BUT WE COULD REPLICATE SOMETHING LIKE THIS IF WE HAVE THE ALL PAYER DATA BASE. I'M AND WHAT YOU SEE IS THAT OVER TIME BETWEEN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN- THE NUMBER OF PHYSICIANS WHO ARE PRACTICING LATE PRACTICING INDEPENDENTLY HAS DECLINED- AND WE ALSO SEE- THIS YEAR A VERTICALLY INTEGRATED PHYSICIAN GROUPS GOING UP OVER TIME. AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS ARE ON COSTS- WOULD BE A KLAY IMPORTANT AT QUESTION FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ADDRESS- JUST LOOKING AT THE MEDICARE DATA WE FIND THAT. THIS CHANGE OVER TIME HAS LED TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER SPENDING IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S UNIQUE IN CALIFORNIA COMPARED TO OTHER STATES- IT IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE MARKET- THAT IS NOT PAID THROUGH FEE FOR SERVICE- TYPES OF PAYMENTS- AND HISTORICALLY A. P. CD'S HAVE FOCUSED ON PULLING IN THOSE FEE FOR SERVICE CLAIMS- SO WE HAVE A VARIETY OF ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODELS IN PLAY- CAPITATION BEING AT THE TOP OF THE LIST- BUT ALSO SOME OF THESEOTHER PAYMENTS LIKE- QUALITY BASED- PAY FOR PERFORMANCE PAYMENTS- SHARED SAVINGS PAYMENTS THAT- ARE IN THESE RESPECTS CONTRACTS- AS WELL. AS FOR THINGS LIKE PRIMARY CARE AND PATIENT CENTERED MEDICAL HOMES. SO IT IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT THAT AS IF HE'S THE DE AND CAL. IS DEVELOPED AND FALL. THAT WE WERE HARD TO CAPTURE BOTH THE CLAIM SPACE PIECE OF THIS AND THESE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENTS TO ESTIMATE THE TOTALITY OF PAYMENTS AND HEALTH CARE SPENDING IN CALIFORNIA. AND JUST AS A FOOTNOTE- OTHER STATES HAVE BEEN WORKING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE- COLORADO BEING ONE- AS WELL AS SOME OF THE WORK GOING ON HERE IN CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE ASSOCIATION. I'M SO SOME OF THE OTHER IS THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE HEALTH CARE PAYMENT DATABASE HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS THE NEED TO INCLUDE MEDICAL DATA- GIVEN THAT- ONE THIRD OF CALIFORNIANS ARE COVERED UNDER MEDICARE HOW- AND ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS COMING OUT OF THE REVIEW COMMITTEE WAS THAT THE H. P. PROGRAM SHOULD PURSUE THE COLLECTION OF MEDI CAL DATA DIRECTLY FROM. THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES I'VE MENTIONED THE NEED FOR- PATIENT IDENTIFIERS AND PHYSICIAN IDENTIFIERS- IT'S REALLY CRITICAL TO BE ABLE TO TRACK PATIENTS OVER TIME AS WELL AS PROVIDERS OVER TIME- AND THESE ARE FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENTS FOR THE DATABASE TO BE USABLE BY A VARIETY OF END USERS- AND THEN LASTLY- I WOULD ENCOURAGE- AT. THE ASSEMBLY TO MAKE SURE THAT- ACCESS TO THE DATA IS BROADLY AVAILABLE- I KNOW THIS LOOKS FAIRLY SELF SERVING- AS I'M A RESEARCHER. BUT WE HAVE THE ABILITY- BOTH HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND NATIONALLY- THERE IS A LOT OF- INTEREST BY RESEARCHERS TO BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE THESE DATA. AND I THINK THE STATE WOULD BE THE ULTIMATE BENEFACTOR HAVING A BROAD ACCESS TO THESE DATA BY A VARIETY OF END USERS SO JUST BRIEFLY THE CAL HEALTH OF HIM DATA. RIVER COMMITTEE ITS WORK LAST WEEK- THE FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS WERE POSTED LAST NIGHT- THE COMMITTEE MADE THIRTY SIX UNANIMOUS RECOMMENDATION STOSCH CODE- AND THEY RECOMMENDED A TIERED APPROACH TO IMPLEMENTING THAT WILL EXPAND THE DATABASE OVER TIME GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF CALIFORNIA- THIS DATABASE IS GOING TO BE THE LARGEST. DATABASE IN THE COUNTRY- AND WE HAVE CERTAIN MARKET DYNAMICS THAT ARE MORE COMPLEX THAN SOME OF THE OTHER STATES OR AT LEAST A LARGER PRESENCE OF THOSE ISSUES- AND SO- FOLLOWING A TIERED APPROACH I THINK WILL HELP US. MOVE EXPEDITIOUSLY TO GET SOMETHING UP AND RUNNING- MORE QUICKLY BUT YOU KNOW CONTINUE TO EXPLORE HOW TO TACKLE SOME OF THOSE PROBLEMS OVER THE LONG HAUL- THE OTHER ISSUE THAT CAME UP WAS- THEY MADE RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT WHO SHOULD BE MANDATORY DATA BY. ALL COMMITTEE MEMBERS- ONE OF THE THINGS- THAT WILL BE MISSING IN THIS DATABASE BECAUSE OF A RISA- IS THAT SELF FUNDED PLANS WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT- THAT I THINK STATES- AND OTHER ACTORS IN THE COMMUNITY SHOULD TRY TO WORK VERY HARD. TO GET THE SOUTH SHIRT PLANS TO SUBMIT THEIR DAY. THE AND I GUESS LASTLY ASHRITA NOW. TO FIND THIS WHICH IT EXPECTS TO DELIVER JULY FOR. OF THIS YEAR. SO WITH THAT I WILL STOP AND MY COLLEAGUES CHRISSY. BEFORE WITH. TO THE LITTLE SWITCH HERE IN A SECOND. THANK YOU THEN WHAT WE'LL ASK AT AT SPECTRUM BUT THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU AND THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY- I'M I'M CRISTINA ABNER FROM RAND CORPORATION- OVER THE PAST BETTER PART OF THE PAST YEAR WE WORKED WITH THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION OR WE CONDUCTED RESEARCH FOR THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION. UNDERSTAND PROMISING OPTIONS TO REDUCE- HEALTHCARE COSTS IN CALIFORNIA- SO NO SURPRISE TO ANYONE HERE. HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE TOP PRIORITY AMONG CALIFORNIANS 45% OF THOSE SURVEYED IT MENTIONED THIS IS THE AMONG CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS MENTIONED THIS IS THEIR TOP PRIORITY. SECOND ONLY TO EDUCATION ACROSS ALL OF PRIORITIES IN THE STATE AND SO WHAT WE DID WITH C. H. C. F. IS- WE LOOKED- WE REVIEWED THE LITERATURE TO UNDERSTAND PROMISING OPTIONS FOR OTHER FROM THAT OTHER STATES ARE OTHER. THAT THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN OTHER STATES OR OTHER SETTINGS. AND THEN WE ASSESS THE EVIDENCE FOR THOSE OPTIONS TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER WOULD BE A VIABLE OPTION FOR CALIFORNIA. SO THERE WERE A TOTAL OF SEVENTEEN OPTIONS THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN THIS IS BASED ON LITERATURE REVIEW ENVIRONMENTAL SCANNED DISCUSSION WITH EXPERTS ACROSS THE STATE. STATE TODAY I'M GONNA FOCUS ON FOUR OF THOSE OPTIONS JUST IN THE INTEREST OF TIME- AND THESE FOR OPTIONS ARE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED CURRENTLY AT BOTH AT. YOU WITH IN CALIFORNIA AND AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL AS TURN IN TERMS OF VERY AT THE PROMISING AND AN IMPORTANT POLICY OPTIONS. THE ONE IS TO REDUCE OUT OF NETWORK FILLING OUT REGULATE HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS. IMPLEMENTED PUBLIC OPTION ON COVER CALIFORNIA. AND THEN EXPAND SCOPE OF PRACTICE FOR NURSE PRACTITIONERS. SO START WITH OUT OF NETWORK BILLING- SO CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY HAS AMONG THE MOST PROTECTIVE. LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN PLACE- TO. PROTECT CONSUMERS AGAINST- OUT OF POCKET BILLING RELATIVE TO ANY STATE TO THE COMMONWEALTH FUNDED A STUDY WHERE THEY FOUND THAT- CALIFORNIA WAS IN THE TOP SIX OF STATES- AND I'VE LISTED SOME OF THESE PROTECTIONS HERE WHICH OF COURSE YOU'RE VERY FAMILIAR WITH. AB SEVENTY TWO PROTECTS FULLY INSURED ENROLLEES FROM TAPE FROM I'M EXPERIENCING A SURPRISE BILL WHEN AN OUT OF NETWORK PHYSICIAN- WHO'S PERFORMING THE WORK IT IN NETWORK HOSPITAL SENSE IN THE BILL- AT TWO THOUSAND AND NINE SUPREME COURT. RULING PROTECTS IN RELEASED- IN IN PLANS REGULATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED CARE FROM- IS FACING AT BALANCE BILLING FROM AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISIT. THE FAIR PRICING ACT PROTECTS LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS FROM FACING- A HIGH CHARGE IF THEY'RE UNINSURED AND GO TO THE HOSPITAL. AND IN CALIFORNIA HAS VERY BROAD NETWORK ADEQUACY PER- PROTECTIONS RELATIVE TO OTHER STATES AND OF COURSE IF YOU HAVE A BROAD NETWORK THE CHANCES OF FACING AN OUT OF NETWORK CHARGE ARE MUCH LOWER. DESPITE ALL OF THESE FOR. ALMOST AT THE OF CAL HAVE RECEIVED AN UNEXPECTED BILL NOW SOME OF THIS COULD BE YOU KNOW PEOPLE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THEIR DEDUCTIBLE OR SOMETHING AD IT WAS UNEXPECTED BUT WITHIN YOU OFF THEIR HEALTH PLAN- BUT- BUT SOME OF THIS IS OUT OF NETWORK BUILDING. AND THE REASON THAT WE MAKING WE CONTINUE TO SEE THIS IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT THERE ARE SOME GAPS AND SO I'VE I'VE LISTED SOME HERE IN THIS CHART- AND YOU CAN SEE ONE BIG GAP IS SELF INSURED PLANS. AND SO THIS IS BECAUSE OF A RECESSION I'LL MENTION THAT- THAT WRIST A PRE AMPS THE STATE FROM REGULATING- SELF INSURED HEALTH PLANS ARE INTERFERING IN ANY WAY WITH THE CONTRACT BETWEEN PROVIDERS AND THOSE SELF INSURED HEALTH PLANS- BUT THEN THERE'S SOME OTHER GAPS INCLUDING SOME SERVICES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER EITHER. ANY OF THESE LAWS SO FOR EXAMPLE OUT OF NETWORK AMBULANCE SERVICES. BILLS FOR INPATIENT STAYS THAT ORIGINATE- IN THE ET AND THEN ALSO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT BILLING PROTECTIONS DON'T EXTEND TO PLANTS REGULATED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. SO WHAT ARE SOME OPTIONS CALIFORNIA COULD TAKE HERE- ONE EASY ONE WOULD BE TO EXTEND THAT- THAT EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PROTECTIONS TO THE CD I REGULATED PLANS- ALSO AT THE STATE COULD CONSIDER- EXTENDING PROTECTIONS TO COVER AMBULANCE SERVICES AN INPATIENT STAYS THAT ORIGINATE FROM THE ET- AND THEN ALSO POTENTIALLY THINK CREATIVELY ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS THE ARREST- ISSUE. SO ONE- SOLUTION THAT'S BEEN PROPOSED IS TO REQUIRE ANCILLARY VISIT PHYSICIANS TO CONTRACT WITH THE HOSPITALS IN WHICH THEY'RE WORKING. AND SO THAT YOU KNOW GETS THE STATE OUT OF REGULATING THE CONTRACT BETWEEN THE PROVIDER AND THE IN SELF INSURED EMPLOYERS. IT WOULD BE THE CONTACT BETWEEN THE HOSPITAL AND THE PROVIDER. ONE THING I DO WANT TO OUT OF THE APPROACH IS TO ADDRESS OUT OF NETWORK BILLING. THIS OF COURSE OF THE PROBLEM FOR CONSUMERS IN TERMS OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY BUT HOW IT AFFECTS TOTAL COST OF CARE WILL DEPEND ON HOW IT'S IMPLEMENTED. SO IN SOME SENSE PROTECTING CONSUMERS MORE FROM OT OF NETWORK CHARGES COULD RESULT IN CONSUMERS EATING USING MORE CARE- OR IF THERE'S A REQUIREMENT THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANY. PAY MORE- THAT COULD AFFECT THEIR LEVERAGE NEGOTIATION WITH PROVIDERS ULTIMATELY LEADING TO INCREASED COST OVERALL- ON THE ON THE FLIP SIDE SOLUTIONS THAT WOULD LIMIT WHAT THE PROVIDER IS ABLE TO CHARGE MIGHT BE MORE LIKELY TO REDUCE COST. SO THE CAREFUL CONSIDERATION IS NEEDED IN IMPLEMENTING THESE KINDS OF POLICIES. OKAY SO I MOVED TO HELP THEM REGULATION OTHER STYLIZED FACTS THAT YOU'RE ALL VERY FAMILIAR WITH BASICALLY THE COST OF CARE HAVE. INCREASED DRAMATICALLY FOR INSURANCE PREMIUMS INSURANCE DEDUCTIBLES OVER THE PAST TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS. SO I WANT TO TURN NOW BACK TO RHODE ISLAND IN THIS IS AN EXAMPLE FROM UP ROAD ISLAND I KNOW THAT- GLENN HAD ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS- BUT JUST BRIEFLY YOU KNOW BIRD ISLAND. IMPLEMENTED THESE VERY COMPREHENSIVE AFFORDABILITY STANDARDS- THAT INCLUDED A MOVING TOWARDS VALUE BASED PAYMENT- THE SETTING A LIMIT ON WHAT AT THAT. PRICE INCREASES COULD COULD OCCUR FROM YEAR TO YEAR WITH AN INSURANCE CONTRACTS. AND THEN ALSO INCREASING SPENDING ON PRIMARY CARE SAID THE STATE ACTUALLY DIRECTED ON INSURANCE COMPANIES TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON PATIENT CENTERED MEDICAL HOMES- AND A RECENT STUDY FOUND. THAT THIS LED TO A FIVE POINT 8% REDUCTION IN IN SPENDING AMONG THE COMMERCIALLY INSURED POPULATION. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT BROKEN OUT HERE THERE WAS A REDUCTION IN FEE FOR SERVICE SPENDING OFFSET SOMEWHAT BY AN INCREASE IN NON FEE FOR SERVICE SPENDING BUT THE NET. EFFECT WAS A 5% REDUCTION. NUMBER DILATED VERY DIFFERENT FROM HEALTH. AS YOU KNOW IN MANY WAYS AND THIS IS THE REGULATIONS THAT THEY PUT IN PLACE WERE ALSO FAIRLY. EXTENSIVE AND YOU KNOW MAYBE IT. THAT BE TOO AMBITIOUS OR A YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW IF. THEY'RE THERE AT WEB MY POINT IS THAT THERE COULD BE. SOME MORE OF THIS. TARGETED APPROACHES THAT MIGHT ACHIEVE SIMILAR RESULTS- IT SO CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY DOESN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY IF YOU OF COURSE THERE'S RATE REVIEW IN CALIFORNIA BUT THE STATE DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DENY RATES IT THEIR- EXCESSIVE- JUST MOVING TO THAT IS. POTENTIALLY SOMETHING THAT COULD SAVE COST SO ANOTHER STATE STUDY FOUND THAT STATES THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO DENY. HAVE LOWER PREMIUMS THAN OTHER STATES AND THE ESTIMATE WOULD BE ABOUT FOUR PERCENT. FOR FOUR POINT 6% SAVINGS- AT LEAST FOR THE INDIVIDUAL INSURANCE MARKET. OKAY LET ME MOVE NOW QUICKLY TO THE PUBLIC OPTION FOR CALIFORNIA. SO PUBLIC OPTION HAS A LOT OF MEETINGS- WHEN WE DEFINE PUBLIC OPTION WE MEAN A PLAN THAT HAS GOVERNMENT NEGOTIATED RATES THAT CAN EITHER BE MEDICATED COULD BE MEDICARE COULD BE SOME PERCENTAGE OF OE OF THOSE TWO. OR SOMETHING ELSE BUT THE KEY IS THAT IT'S NEGOTIATED PUBLICLY. SO HOW COULD IT COULD PUBLIC OPTION SAVE MONEY WELL ONE CHALLENGE IN ESTIMATING THIS IS THAT A PUBLIC OPTION JUST HAS NOT YET BEEN IMPLEMENTED ANYWHERE AND SO WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WE HAVE TO RELY ON FORECAST SIMULATIONS- THE CBO AND RAND HAVE ESTIMATED THOSE CONSUMERS AFFECTED BY THE PUBLIC OPTIONS SO THERE IS SOME SOME EVIDENCE THERE AND IN WASHINGTON STATE AND ALSO THE STATE OF COLORADO ARE CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING WASHINGTON STATE'S PUBLIC OPTION WILL GO INTO EFFECT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND SO WE'LL KNOW MORE AFTER THAT HAPPENS AS TO HOW EXACTLY THIS PLAYS OUT IN TERMS OF COST CONTROL- BUT YOU KNOW ONE. IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION FOR CALIFORNIA AND THINKING ABOUT THIS IS THAT IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO GET PROVIDERS TO AGREE ON ON SIX SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER RATES SO IN WASHINGTON STATE- ULTIMATELY THE PUBLIC OPTION IS GOING TO HAVE RATES THAT ARE ON OUR 110060% OF MEDICARE BUT THE STATUS QUO IS ABOUT A 174% OF MEDICARE SO THIS IS A LESS THAN 10% REDUCTION AND SO THAT WAS A LOT OF WORK TO GET TO WHAT MIGHT BE SOMEWHAT OF A MARGINAL CHANGE AND THE OTHER ISSUE TO CONSIDER IS THAT. IT TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS IS AFFECTING ENROLLEES ON THE MARKET PLACES THE MAJORITY EVEN RELEASED ON THE MARKET PLACE IN CALIFORNIA RECEIVE TAX CREDITS AND THE WAY THOSE TAX CREDITS OR STRUCTURE STRUCTURE IS THE INDIVIDUAL PAYS A PERCENT INCOME CONTRIBUTION AND THEN THE TAX CREDIT COVERS THE REMAINDER OF THE PREMIUM COST UP TO THE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK PLAN. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE PUBLIC OPTION AFFECTS THE COSTS OF THE BENCHMARK PLAN IT COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF LOWERING THE THAT TAX CREDITS WITHOUT AFFECTING THAT THE CONSUMERS BOTTOM LINE AND SO ANOTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION- AND BEYOND THAT YOU KNOW THE SAVINGS FROM REDUCED TAX CREDITS WILL COURSE GO PRIMARILY TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. OKAY LET TURN TO MY BEST OPTION THIS IS EXPANDING PARTNER PRACTITIONER SCOPE. A THIRTY AND SO CALIFORNIA IS OFTEN A LEADER- IN TERMS OF STATES AND IN TERMS OF ADOPTING INNOVATIVE- SOLUTIONS. NOT AS MUCH NECESSARILY WITH NURSE PRACTITIONER SCOPE OF PRACTICE CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE STAR TWENTY FIVE STATES THAT DON'T HAVE BROAD AUTHORITY FOR NURSE PRACTITIONERS. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT NURSE PRACTITIONERS A PROVIDE CARE IN IN A LESS COSTLY MANNER THEN THEN THEN EMPTIES SO THIS IS A STUDY THAT COMPARED THE TOTAL COST OF CARE OVER A YEAR. AMONG PATIENTS ASSIGNED TO A NURSE PRACTITIONER AS THEIR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER COMPARED TO THOSE ASSIGNED TO A AND D. AS THEIR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER THE USER RISK ADJUSTED SO WHERE WE'RE DEALING WITH GOT READ THIS ADDRESSES DIFFERENCES IN PATIENT ACUITY AND CONDITIONS- AND YOU CAN SEE ACROSS VARIOUS MEASURES OF COST OF CARE- THE NURSE PRACTITIONERS PROVIDED LOWER COST OF CARE. RANGING FROM ELEVEN TO. 29% SAVINGS. ANOTHER IMPORTANT THAT WAS RAISED WE HEAR THE DEBATE ABOUT NURSE PRACTITIONER SCOPE OF PRACTICE IS WHETHER QUALITY OF CARE COULD BE AFFECTED. AND IN THE LITERATURE REVIEW WE REVIEWED FOR CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION WE FOUND THAT THAT AS NOT THE CASE AND IN FACT WE FOUND EVIDENCE THE QUALITY OF CARE MAY BE IMPROVED. SO THIS IS FROM I THOUGHT A CLEVER STUDY THAT LOOKED AT- HOW CHANGES IN. IS GO PRACTICE LOS ACROSS STATES OVER TIME- WE'RE SO SEE IT WITH CHANGES IN VARIOUS MEASURES OF QUALITY- AND SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THE STUDY FOUND THAT THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN THE PROBABILITY OF HAVING OF. A ROUTINE CHECK UP AS COOPER PRACTICE EXPANDED AND INCREASING THE PROBABILITY OF HAVING USUAL SOURCE OF CARE. I'M INCREASING THE PROBABILITY THAT PATIENTS RATED THEIR HEALTHCARE QUALITY IS EXCELLENT- AND INCREASING THE PROBABILITYTHE PATIENTS RATED THEIR HEALTH STATUS IS EXCELLENT- WHAT WE WHERE WHERE THEY DID FIND A DECREASE WAS AN EASY VISIT SO A SLIGHT REDUCTION EDIE DOES IT'S PERHAPS BECAUSE PATIENTS WERE HEALTHIER OR BECAUSE THEY WERE USING. AT THAT THEY HAD A USUAL SOURCE OF CARE. SO SOME RATES THE RICE CONCLUDE THOUGHTS THERE MANY PROMISE OPTIONS FOR CAO IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND. IS A UNIQUE STATES YOU KNOW THERE IS SOME. YOU IT BUT WE HAVE TO THINK CAREFULLY WHETHER THESE WILL ALTER. DIRECTLY TO CALIFORNIA ONE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE IN CALIFORNIA VERSUS OTHER STATES IS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A MUCH GREATER PENETRATION OF MANAGED CARE. AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT SOME OF THESE POLICIES ARE CAPTURING LOW HANGING FRUIT. MAYBE MANAGED CARE'S ALREADY ADDRESSING SOME OF THAT IN AND IT MAY BE A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT. ON THE OTHER THING TO CONSIDER IS THAT MANY OF THESE OPTIONS LOOK LIKE THEY SAVE A HECK OF A LOT OF MONEY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DOLLAR VALUE. BUT WHEN YOU COMPARE THAT TO CALIFORNIA'S YOU KNOW THREE HUNDRED BILLION EVEN BASED ON THE TWENTY FOURTEEN ESTIMATE- ANNUAL SPENDING- ET THEIR SMALL PERCENTAGES SO IT'S PROBABLE THAT. THAT THE STATE WILL HAVE TO IMPROVE MULTIPLE POLICY OPTIONS IT WANTS IN ORDER REALLY BEND THE COST CURVE- AND THEN FINALLY I JUST WANT TO CONCLUDE BY SAYING THE CALIFORNIA. I'M HAS A TRADITION OF BEING AN EARLY ADOPTER AND A TREND SETTER ACROSS THE COUNTRY YOU KNOW THAT. THAT'S TRUE IN MANY AREAS FASHION- TECHNOLOGY- BUT ALSO POTENTIALLY IN HEALTHCARE AND I THINK THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY REALLY A PRESENTS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO BE A PEAK INTO OTHER STATES- IN THIS IMPORTANT POLICY ISSUE. THANK YOU. WOW THANK YOU. MUCH REALLY APPRECIATE THE AND- A LOT OF THAT'S ME. TO MY. ANY QUESTION MISTER THERE AND- THE OKAY. SO A LOT TO TAKE A LOT TO TAKE AND IT IS AND OF COURSE I'M I'M I'M VERY DAY DRIVEN. AND SO DATABASE SOMETHING THAT IS NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART AS ARE SOME OF THE OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS AND THAT YOU'VE WE PUT OUT THERE SO I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- WE LOOK FORWARD TO- TAPPING INTO YOUR- VAST INFORMATION NETWORK OF- FOR AS WE LOOK FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES OVER TIME. AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THANK. SO YEAH. WE WOULD LIKE TO AYE AYE IT IS NEW WE WERE GOING TO A NEW I DO TO AB HOW OPPORTUNE FOR PUBLIC SO CORRECT OF SEE A MUCH OF HIM OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO SPEAK THE PUBLIC COMMENT. SURE SURE GREAT SO WE COULD KIND OF LIMIT. TIME THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. BUT PLEASE THIS AHEAD ALL RIGHT OF RAMON BECAUSE OF LONG CAL WANTS HER AMERICANS ON TO APPLY YOU SO WHEN WERE FOR HAVING THIS HEARING THINK THIS IS X. IMPORTANT TOPIC WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET TO ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE WITHOUT DEALING WITH COSTS US AN ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL FIRST STEP I HAVE TO SAY THAT- DOCTOR AYE PREFERS A PRESENTATION- OF WHAT I THOUGHT WAS EXCELLENT. IN TERMS OF SOME VERY PRACTICAL AND DURABLE OF POLICY IDEAS I WOULD ALSO JUST ADD THAT TO WELL OF HOSPITAL ARE PUTTING ONLY A BECAUSE THE BARREL SALAS OF. HE WAS A MARYLAND FILL MAYBE IT WAS MASS FELLA SO WELL IT'S ONLY IF WELL TO THIRD OF ALL HELL COSTS I THINK THE WORTH TROUBLE IN IN TERMS OF GETTING A WAIVER WHO KNOWS WHO THE NEXT PRESIDENT ON STATES IS GOING TO BE SO AND MAY NOT BE AS FAR FETCHED NINETY AS POSSIBLE SO LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR CONTINUED WORK IN THIS AREA THANK. YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CHAIR MEMBER BARBER CLAY WITH THE CAL HAAS IS SO. REP CAL. FOR HOW PLUS. TODAY WE HAVE FROM A NUMBER OF POLICY EXPERTS ON THE NUMEROUS FACTOR WE MUST CONSIDER IS THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE PORTABILITY. ANALYZES AND ESTABLISHES SUSTAINABLE POLLS. TO DO THIS RIGHT IN A WAY THAT IS BOTH IN POLAND SUSTAINABLE THERE MUST BE THOUGHTFUL A THOUGHTFUL PLAN WITH ESTABLISHING AN INDEPENDENT OFFICE. THE WILL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT COSTS FROM ALL INVOLVED IN THE DELIVERY OF HEALTHCARE. INCLUDING COMMERCIAL INSURANCE CARRIERS AND HOSPITAL'S INPUT COSTS. WE COMMIT TO WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE TO DEVELOP A PROPOSAL THAT ENSURES TWO THINGS AMONG OTHER ISSUES. THAT HOSPITALS CAN CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY POSSIBLE TO MEET THEIR MISSION OF CARE QUALITY. AND THAT HOSPITALS ARE NOT THE ONLY GROUP WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT ARE OFFERING REAL SOLUTIONS TO THE HEALTH CARE PORTABILITY ISSUE. THE WILL PROVIDE ECONOMIC QUICKLY TO CALIFORNIANS CJ LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE THE ADMINISTRATION AND ALL STAKEHOLDERS. ON THE FORMATION OF THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE PORTABILITY AND THANK YOU TODAY FOR THIS. PANEL AN EXPERT I THINK IT'S- EXTREMELY VALUABLE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU MUCH. KELLY BE ON BEHALF OF THE CAL MEDICAL. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE HEARING TO. WE ARE VERY SO OF THE GUY FOR TO OF. FOR HEALTH CARE CONSUMERS INCLUDING ADDRESSING UNDERLYING COST DRIVERS LIKE DELIVERY SYSTEM CONSOLIDATION. THIS EFFORT TO CURB HEALTH CARE COST GROWTH SHOULD ALSO INCLUDE PAYMENT DELIVERY SYSTEM REFORM. AND THE PROMOTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLIFICATION. WE LOOK FOR TO THE DISCUSSIONS DURING THE BUDGET- BUDGET PROCESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS BILL BARCELONA FOR AMERICA'S POSITION GROUPS- THE LARGE ORGANIZATION UNITED STATES REPRESENTING. PROVIDERS WHO ARE PAID ON A PERFORMANCE BASED MODEL- THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE EXCELLENT PRESENTATIONS TODAY FOR THE DATA THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED ON ONLINE- WE AGREE WITH MUCH OF WHAT HAS BEEN PRESENTED TODAY AND- WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO HOLD MORE OF THESE HEARINGS TO BRING IN MORE EXPERTS TO TALK ABOUT MORE SOLUTIONS. TO PROVIDING AFFORDABILITY. AND WE AS WELL AS A P. G. SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY WE SUPPORT THE- CREATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE. AND LOOK FORWARD TO GREATER TRANSPARENCY AROUND COSTING QUALITY- IN OUR SYSTEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR MUCH IS THERE ANYONE ELSE. SEE NO ONE BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY COMMENTS OR ANY MISTER IS THERE ANYTHING. WE GET YOU ALL THE SLOW JACKSON. OKAY WELL MAKE SURE WOULD MAKE SURE YOU GET EVERY. I WAS A THANK YOU OUR PAY AND EVERYBODY IN THE AYE THIS BEEN. THIS IS BEEN REALLY VALUE PERSONALLY FASCINATING TO ME I AM A DAY GEEK AND THIS IS I GUESS I'M DE AND KEEP HIM TODAY. BUT BY IT IS REAL REALLY BAD AND AS WE WERE FORWARD WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ON THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY AND REALLY BEGINNING TO TACKLE SOME OF THE THESE COST DRIVERS- IN IN HEALTHCARE IT'S IF YOU LIKE IT'S LONG OVERDUE- IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS DRIVEN ME PERSONALLY- AND I THINK WITH THIS- WITH THIS NEW APPROACH WE HAVE TO PUT. CHAU TO REALLY IN TWO TO AN END TO AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY LOOK HOLISTICALLY AT THAT AT THE PROBLEM YOU KNOW I AND AT THE CHALLENGE IN THE LEGISLATIVE ARENA IS THAT. WE AS AT LEGISLATOR APPROACH MY CONSTANT SOME WE WORK AT AT PARTS OF THE ISSUE BUT WE DON'T ALWAYS GET THE OPPORTUNITY LOOK HOLISTICALLY AT WHAT'S DRIVING THESE. DRIVING THESE AND WHAT ARE THE TO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SO I WILL GO BACK TO THE- VALUE ASIA NIGHT AND WE WILL BE LOOKING TO TRIED ONLY TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT. COMES ON. TO TRY TO MAKE IT ONLINE. BUT ALSO LOOK TO FIND A WAY TO GET THE DATA COLLECTION TO HAPPEN SOONER OF A LOT THE SOONER WE HAVE DATA- THE AND IS A DATABASE TO OPERATE. THAT JUST LIKE THERE'S MORE YOU FOR EVERYONE AGAINST AS THOSE HELLO TO ASSIST. AND I'M A MUCH NEEDED IN LAPSED.
