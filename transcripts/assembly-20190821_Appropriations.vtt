00:49:03.373 --> 00:49:05.676
LUCK I'VE I LIVE ON THAT ROAD.

00:49:05.742 --> 00:49:06.276
HOWEVER I LIVE ON THAT ROAD

00:49:06.343 --> 00:49:08.312

NEGOTIATED LANGUAGE THE SECOND

00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:23.226
IS THAT. REMEMBER THE DEBTORS

00:49:23.293 --> 00:49:25.062

TOXIC CHEMICALS IN OUR BE

00:53:48.091 --> 00:53:50.460
WASTING TANKS WE'VE WORKED

00:53:50.527 --> 00:53:52.562
REALLY HARD AT TRYING TO JUST

00:53:52.629 --> 00:53:58.301
OF. TO RATIONALIZE WHY THE

00:53:58.368 --> 00:53:59.936

THE COST WAS FORTY THOUSAND

00:54:15.185 --> 00:54:16.252
DOLLARS SO WE BELIEVE THAT THAT

00:54:16.319 --> 00:54:18.054
NUMBER IS OVER INFLATED. THAT

00:54:18.121 --> 00:54:20.957
IT'S PROBABLY A LOT CLOSER TO

00:54:21.024 --> 00:54:21.591
FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WITH

00:54:21.658 --> 00:54:23.994

BILL. IT'S HARD FOR US TO

IMAGINE WHY IT WOULD COST OVER
