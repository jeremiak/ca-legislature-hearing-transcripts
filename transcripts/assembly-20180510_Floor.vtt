I LIKE TO HEAR THE WISDOM OF MY

SISTER JAMIE MOTHER OF THREE.

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.242
WHEN YOUR CHILDREN WERE BECOMING

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:08.746
CALLED ME WAY PAST WHEN A. M..

00:34:08.813 --> 00:34:10.348
IT WAS JUST DAYS BEFORE HER

00:34:10.415 --> 00:34:12.083
MIDDLE CHILD WAS ABOUT TO BE IN

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:15.653

JEANNIE.

00:34:21.125 --> 00:34:22.960
I KNEW THAT I WOULD NEVER FORGET

00:34:23.027 --> 00:34:25.963
THAT EARLY MORNING CONVERSATION.

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:28.399
I QUIETLY SAID. I KNOW NOW WHAT

00:34:28.466 --> 00:34:30.401
IT MEANS TO BE A MOM.

00:34:30.468 --> 00:34:32.270
I ASKED HER WHAT IS THAT.

00:34:32.336 --> 00:34:34.839
SHE SAID. BEING A MOM IS HAVING

00:34:34.906 --> 00:34:36.941
TO LEARN TO LET GO.

00:34:37.008 --> 00:34:38.709
THEN SHE WENT ON TO SAY. YOU

00:34:38.776 --> 00:34:41.012

00:34:41.078 --> 00:34:42.580
YOU GIVE BIRTH AND YOU HAVE TO

00:34:42.647 --> 00:34:45.183
LET HER GO.

00:34:45.249 --> 00:34:47.485
SOON HE'S TODDLING ALONG HOLDING

00:34:47.552 --> 00:34:49.153

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:50.822
IS RUNNING OFF AND YOU HAVE TO

00:34:50.888 --> 00:34:52.790
LET HER GO.

00:34:52.857 --> 00:34:54.258
THE DAY COMES WHEN THE TRAINING

00:34:54.325 --> 00:34:56.027
WHEELS COME OFF THE BIKE. AND

00:34:56.093 --> 00:34:58.729

00:34:58.796 --> 00:35:01.032

00:35:04.602 --> 00:35:06.604

LICENSE GO OFF TO COLLEGE.

00:35:10.174 --> 00:35:12.710
AND THEN AFTER A PAUSE SHE SAID.

00:35:12.777 --> 00:35:15.012
NOW MY BABY IS GOING TO FRANCE

00:35:15.079 --> 00:35:17.415

00:35:17.482 --> 00:35:19.283

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:21.352
THIS WITH ME THAT EARLY MORNING.

00:35:21.419 --> 00:35:22.920
THEN I SAID TO HER. YOU'RE

00:35:22.987 --> 00:35:25.256
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

00:35:25.323 --> 00:35:27.024
BUT AS I'VE BEEN TAUGHT. IT'S

ALTHOUGH WE KNOW THIS TO BE TRUE.

00:35:48.179 --> 00:35:50.114

SET OF AMENDMENTS TO ENHANCE

01:31:10.765 --> 01:31:12.166
WHAT I THINK IS THE RIGHT GOAL

01:31:12.233 --> 01:31:13.568
WHICH IS TO REDUCE LABOR STRIFE

01:31:13.634 --> 01:31:14.836
AYE WITHIN THE BART SYSTEM IN

01:31:14.902 --> 01:31:17.071
THE BAY AREA. AND TO ENSURE THAT

01:31:17.138 --> 01:31:18.573
IT'S LESS LIKELY IN THE FUTURE

01:31:18.639 --> 01:31:20.107
THAT WE RELIVE THE STRIKES THAT

01:31:20.174 --> 01:31:21.442
HAVE PLAGUED THE BAY AREA IN THE

01:31:21.509 --> 01:31:23.277
PAST I KNOW THE AUTHORS. A VERY

01:31:23.344 --> 01:31:24.745
WELL WRITTEN ADVOCACY ON BEHALF

OF THE BILL MENTIONS THAT THE

01:31:26.514 --> 01:31:27.849
TWENTY THIRTEEN BART STRIKES

01:31:27.915 --> 01:31:29.383
THERE WERE TWO OF THEM WERE AN

01:31:29.450 --> 01:31:31.152
INSPIRATION FOR THIS SPELL. AND

01:31:31.219 --> 01:31:32.520
I BELIEVE THAT WITHOUT THESE

01:31:32.587 --> 01:31:33.955
AMENDMENTS AND WE WILL NOT BE

01:31:34.021 --> 01:31:35.857
ABLE TO STE TO HAVE THE FULL

01:31:35.923 --> 01:31:36.924
POTENTIAL OF THE BILL REACHED.

01:31:36.991 --> 01:31:38.593
BART IS A MAJOR COMPONENT OF BAY

01:31:38.659 --> 01:31:40.361
AREA TRANSPORTATION OVER FOUR

01:31:40.428 --> 01:31:42.096
HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND

01:31:42.163 --> 01:31:44.165
PEOPLE A DAY RELY ON BART TO GET

01:31:44.232 --> 01:31:45.733
TO WORK SEE THEIR DOCTOR GET TO

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:47.501
SCHOOL ENGAGING LIFE IN THE BAY

01:31:47.568 --> 01:31:49.570
AREA. AND EVERY DAY WRITERS COME

01:31:49.637 --> 01:31:51.906
FROM ALL OVER THE BAY AREA NORTH.

01:31:51.973 --> 01:31:54.275
EAST SOUTH.

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:56.244
AND BART IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL

01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:58.880
TO BAY AREA MOBILITY AND I THINK

01:31:58.946 --> 01:32:00.514
PUBLIC SAFETY.

01:32:00.581 --> 01:32:02.250
WITHOUT BART WORKER SHOWING UP

01:32:02.316 --> 01:32:04.385
TO DO THEIR JOBS AND CONTINUING

01:32:04.452 --> 01:32:05.720
TO ENSURE THAT PART HAS

01:32:05.786 --> 01:32:07.922
CONTINUOUS UNINTERRUPTED SERVICE

01:32:07.989 --> 01:32:09.824
PART IS NOT THE LIFE LINE IT

01:32:09.891 --> 01:32:11.692
NEEDS TO BE FOR THE BAY AREA.

01:32:11.759 --> 01:32:12.593
NOW IS OUR.

01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:14.128
GOOD COLLEGE IN CUPERTINO HAS

01:32:14.195 --> 01:32:15.162
MENTIONED IN HIS WRITTEN SUPPORT

01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:16.831
FOR THE BILL THE INSPIRATION FOR

01:32:16.898 --> 01:32:18.099
THE UNDERLYING BILL IS TO

01:32:18.165 --> 01:32:20.534
PREVENT FUTURE BART STRIKES.

01:32:20.601 --> 01:32:21.869
EVERYONE IN THE BAY AREA GOT A

01:32:21.936 --> 01:32:24.005
TERRIBLE REMINDER OF THE NEED TO

01:32:24.071 --> 01:32:25.940
DO THAT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WHEN

01:32:26.007 --> 01:32:27.541
THE STRIKES CAME FORWARD. AND IT

01:32:27.608 --> 01:32:29.210
BROUGHT THE ENTIRE BAY AREA TO A

01:32:29.277 --> 01:32:30.578
GRINDING HALT WE LOST SEVENTY

01:32:30.645 --> 01:32:33.014
THREE MILLION DOLLARS A DAY. IN

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:34.548
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY FROM BART

MORE CARS REPORT ON THE ROADS AS

01:32:38.152 --> 01:32:40.121
ARE AIRIES ROADS FREEWAYS AND

OTHER SYSTEMS WERE. COMPLETELY

01:32:41.889 --> 01:32:43.824
OVERWHELMED SIXTEEN MILLION

01:32:43.891 --> 01:32:46.227
POUNDS OF CARBON WERE RELEASED

01:32:46.294 --> 01:32:47.762
INTO THE ENVIRONMENT ON A DAILY

01:32:47.828 --> 01:32:50.264
BASIS FROM THE BART STRIKES.

01:32:50.331 --> 01:32:50.965
AND.

01:32:51.032 --> 01:32:53.067
THE UNDERLYING BILL DOESN'T

01:32:53.134 --> 01:32:54.135
PREVENT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:32:54.201 --> 01:32:55.469
THOSE STRIKES TO HAPPEN IN THE

01:32:55.536 --> 01:32:57.238
WAY THAT WE ARE OFTEN CONFRONTED

01:32:57.305 --> 01:32:59.473
WITH AND THAT'S THIS.

01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:01.909
BART WORKERS ALREADY AGREED IN

01:33:01.976 --> 01:33:03.878
THEIR CONTRACT NOT TO STRIKE.

01:33:03.945 --> 01:33:06.013
THEY HAVE A NO STRIKE CLAUSE.

01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:07.949
WHAT HAPPENS IS THE NEGOTIATIONS

01:33:08.015 --> 01:33:09.150
GO FORWARD AND THE CONTRACT

01:33:09.216 --> 01:33:10.651
EXPIRES?

01:33:10.718 --> 01:33:12.386
DURING THAT EXPIRATION PERIOD

01:33:12.453 --> 01:33:14.088
BART CONTINUES TO PAY THEIR

01:33:14.155 --> 01:33:15.890

01:33:19.961 --> 01:33:22.063
BUT BART DOES NOT BELIEVE OF

01:33:22.129 --> 01:33:23.064
THE BART WORKERS DON'T BELIEVE

01:33:23.130 --> 01:33:25.032

01:33:25.099 --> 01:33:27.001
CLAUSE. DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS

01:33:27.068 --> 01:33:28.769
SO THE CONTRACTS EXPIRED THEY

01:33:28.836 --> 01:33:29.770
DON'T THINK THEY HAVE TO HONOR

01:33:29.837 --> 01:33:30.938
THE NO STRIKE BECAUSE BUT THEY

TO. THIS IS THE ONE CONNECTION

01:39:28.162 --> 01:39:30.831
BETWEEN BART ACROSS THE BAY AREA.

01:39:30.898 --> 01:39:32.132
IT'S CRITICAL AND IT IS A

01:39:32.199 --> 01:39:33.200
BOTTLENECK

01:39:33.267 --> 01:39:34.635
THERE ARE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN

01:39:34.702 --> 01:39:35.869
LABOR AND MANAGEMENT THAT NEED

01:39:35.936 --> 01:39:37.538
TO OCCUR RELATED TO THE WORK

01:39:37.604 --> 01:39:38.539

BE SHUT DOWN IT'S CALLED THE

01:39:43.944 --> 01:39:44.912
BLANKET THE HOURS OF NO

OPERATION FOR WORKERS TO GO

01:39:46.780 --> 01:39:48.615
THROUGH AND DO THE WORK. IT ALSO

01:39:48.682 --> 01:39:50.684
INCLUDES WHO WILL BE CATEGORIZED

01:39:50.751 --> 01:39:52.853
AS SAFETY SENSITIVE POSITIONS

01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:54.588
AND A FEDERAL LAW WILL APPLY.

01:39:54.655 --> 01:39:56.056
THOSE ARE ISSUES THAT LABOR AND

01:39:56.123 --> 01:39:57.458
MANAGEMENT NEED TO WORK OUT

01:39:57.524 --> 01:39:59.193
UNDER EXISTING LAW THEY CAN WORK

01:39:59.259 --> 01:40:00.728
THEM OUT WHILE THE SAFETY

01:40:00.794 --> 01:40:02.696
RETROFIT OF THE TRANSBAY TO

01:40:02.763 --> 01:40:04.898
WHICH IS CRITICAL. CONTINUES TO

01:40:04.965 --> 01:40:08.369
MOVE FORWARD IF THIS BILL PASSES.

01:40:08.435 --> 01:40:09.803
THAT WORK WILL STOP BECAUSE A

01:40:09.870 --> 01:40:11.839
NEW FACT FINDING PROCESS WILL

01:40:11.905 --> 01:40:13.941
NEED TO BEGIN BEFORE ANY FURTHER

01:40:14.007 --> 01:40:15.342
WORK CAN CONTINUE AND THAT

01:40:15.409 --> 01:40:16.677
PROCESS WHILE TECHNICALLY ON THE

01:40:16.744 --> 01:40:17.811
BOOKS IS SUPPOSED TO LAST FOR

01:40:17.878 --> 01:40:19.680
SEVERAL DAYS. CAN LAST TYPICALLY

01:40:19.747 --> 01:40:21.615
THREE TO SIX MONTHS THAT MEANS

01:40:21.682 --> 01:40:23.684
TRANSBAY TUBE SAFETY WORK WILL

01:40:23.751 --> 01:40:25.252
NOT HAPPEN.

01:40:25.319 --> 01:40:26.687
BART WILL BE DELAYED IN DOING

01:40:26.754 --> 01:40:28.622
SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS AS A RESULT

01:40:28.689 --> 01:40:30.224
OF THIS LEGISLATION.

01:40:30.290 --> 01:40:32.059
GIVE A SECOND EXAMPLE.

01:40:32.126 --> 01:40:33.961
CRITICAL TO BART HAVING OF THE.

01:40:34.027 --> 01:40:35.963
GREATEST CAPACITY THAT IT NEEDS

01:40:36.029 --> 01:40:37.464
I THINK ALL BAY AREA RESIDENTS

01:40:37.531 --> 01:40:38.565
REALIZE PART NEEDS GREATER

01:40:38.632 --> 01:40:40.501
CAPACITY THEY'RE GETTING A LOT

01:40:40.567 --> 01:40:41.869
OF NEW TRAINS ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE

01:40:41.935 --> 01:40:43.670
EIGHTY NEW TRAINS THESE TRAINS

01:40:43.737 --> 01:40:45.205
HAVE COMPUTERIZED.

01:40:45.272 --> 01:40:46.874
MONITORING AND TRAIN CONTROL

01:40:46.940 --> 01:40:47.441
SYSTEMS THAT WILL BE PART OF

01:40:47.508 --> 01:40:48.475
THEM.

01:40:48.542 --> 01:40:50.210
IMPLEMENTING THESE NEW

01:40:50.277 --> 01:40:51.745
COMPUTERIZED TRAIN CONTROL

01:40:51.812 --> 01:40:53.480
SYSTEM REQUIRES NEGOTIATIONS

01:40:53.547 --> 01:40:55.816
BETWEEN LABOR AND MANAGEMENT

01:40:55.883 --> 01:40:57.317
ABOUT HOW PEOPLE WILL BE TRAINED

01:40:57.384 --> 01:40:58.218
WHO WILL OWN.

01:40:58.285 --> 01:41:00.254
OPERATE AT THE NEW CONTROL

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:00.821
CENTERS WHAT WILL THE WORK

01:41:00.888 --> 01:41:03.457
CONDITIONS BE UNDER EXISTING LAW.

01:41:03.524 --> 01:41:05.192
THOSE NEGOTIATIONS CAN BE WORKED

01:41:05.259 --> 01:41:07.194
OUT WITH LESS STRIFE WHILE THE

01:41:07.261 --> 01:41:09.062
WORK CONTINUES TO IMPLEMENT THE

01:41:09.129 --> 01:41:10.664
TRAIN MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS UNDER

01:41:10.731 --> 01:41:13.333
THIS BILL THE WORK WILL STOP.

01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:14.868
AND THAT MEANS THAT BART WILL

01:41:14.935 --> 01:41:16.670
NOT HAVE THE FULL CAPACITY IT IS

01:41:16.737 --> 01:41:17.738
TRYING TO GET FROM THE NEW

01:41:17.805 --> 01:41:19.406
TRAINS THAT THIS BODY IS PUTTING

01:41:19.473 --> 01:41:21.942
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO.

01:41:22.009 --> 01:41:23.610
THEN NEEDED CAPACITY ACROSS THE

01:41:23.677 --> 01:41:25.112
TRANSBAY TUBE WHICH IS SUPPOSED

01:41:25.179 --> 01:41:26.680
TO INCREASE BY THIRTY PERCENT IF

01:41:26.747 --> 01:41:28.115
THESE TRAIN CONTROL SYSTEMS ARE

01:41:28.182 --> 01:41:30.284
PUT INTO PLACE WILL NOT HAPPEN

01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:32.252
THIRTY SECONDS OR SO.

01:41:32.319 --> 01:41:34.922
THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO LEAVE

01:41:34.988 --> 01:41:36.657
EXISTING LAW THE WAY IT IS.

01:41:36.723 --> 01:41:37.991
BECAUSE WE ARE MORE LIKELY TO

01:41:38.058 --> 01:41:39.726
CREATE STRIFE AND LABOR

01:41:39.793 --> 01:41:41.228
STOPPAGES INSTEAD OF THE WORK

01:41:41.295 --> 01:41:42.896
CONTINUES AND FINALLY THERE ARE

01:41:42.963 --> 01:41:45.666
FIVE. UNIONS RELATED TO BART

01:41:45.732 --> 01:41:47.201
THIS PROVISION WILL ONLY APPLY

01:41:47.267 --> 01:41:48.535
TO ONE OF THEM THE SMALLEST

01:41:48.602 --> 01:41:50.304
UNION SO THAT WHEN WE COME TO A

01:41:50.370 --> 01:41:51.438
CONTRACT.

01:41:51.505 --> 01:41:53.874
EXPIRATION PERIOD WILL HAVE

01:41:53.941 --> 01:41:55.342
DIFFERENT RULES FOR HOW

01:41:55.409 --> 01:41:56.944
CONTINUING LABOR NEGOTIATIONS

01:41:57.010 --> 01:41:59.746
HAVE TO GO FORWARD. WILL IT STOP.

01:41:59.813 --> 01:42:01.782
ALL MANNER OF NEGOTIATIONS AND

01:42:01.849 --> 01:42:03.217
WORK WELL THERE'S A STRIKE OR

01:42:06.019 --> 01:42:07.421

01:42:07.488 --> 01:42:08.622

THIS BILL AND I WANT TO CLARIFY

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:20.467
SOME THINGS I HEARD BECAUSE I

01:42:20.534 --> 01:42:21.702
THINK IT'S A LITTLE CONFUSING

01:42:21.768 --> 01:42:22.970
WHEN PEOPLE START TALKING ABOUT

01:42:23.036 --> 01:42:24.238
WORK STOPPAGES.

01:42:24.304 --> 01:42:25.739
ANY TIME WORKERS ARE UNDER A

01:42:25.806 --> 01:42:28.408
CONTRACT THEY CANNOT STRIKE.

01:42:28.475 --> 01:42:29.810
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THERE

01:42:29.877 --> 01:42:31.078
SUBJECT TO THE P. YOU SEE IS A

01:42:31.144 --> 01:42:32.746
PART WORKERS ARE CURRENTLY AND

01:42:32.813 --> 01:42:34.014
HAVE TO TAKE ANY MATTERS TO

01:42:34.081 --> 01:42:35.349
COURT OR IF THEY'RE SUBJECT TO

01:42:35.415 --> 01:42:36.583
PER.

01:42:36.650 --> 01:42:38.151
WHAT PROOF DOES IS ACTUALLY DE

01:42:38.218 --> 01:42:39.887
ESCALATE ISSUES BETWEEN

01:42:39.953 --> 01:42:41.822
MANAGEMENT LABOR BY WORKING IT

01:42:41.889 --> 01:42:43.190
OUT AND IT'S TOUGH IT AT?

01:42:43.257 --> 01:42:45.359
TRIED WAY AWAY THAT ALL PUBLIC

01:42:45.425 --> 01:42:46.660
EMPLOYEES ARE A VAST MAJORITY

01:42:46.727 --> 01:42:48.462
PUBLIC EMPLOYEES CURRENTLY HAVE

01:42:48.529 --> 01:42:50.697
TO WORK OUT DISPUTES.

01:42:50.764 --> 01:42:52.232
IT TO SUGGEST THAT IF THERE ARE

01:42:52.299 --> 01:42:53.667
SAFETY REGULATIONS MOVING

01:42:53.734 --> 01:42:55.435
FORWARD AND THE UNION

01:42:55.502 --> 01:42:57.204
REPRESENTING THE WORKERS THINK

01:42:57.271 --> 01:42:58.939
THAT MAYBE THERE OUR REGULATIONS

01:42:59.006 --> 01:43:00.807
THAT NEED BE IT HERE TO TO KEEP

01:43:00.874 --> 01:43:02.009
THOSE WORKER SAFE. THAT THE WAY

01:43:02.075 --> 01:43:03.443
TO WORK IT OUT IS TO CONTINUE TO

01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:05.112
DO THAT WORK IN AN UNSAFE WAY

01:43:05.178 --> 01:43:06.613
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEN THE WORK

01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:08.315
GETS DONE. AYE I WOULD QUESTION

01:43:08.382 --> 01:43:09.917
WHETHER THAT'S A GOOD APPROACH

01:43:09.983 --> 01:43:13.487
THAT ANY UNION OR ANY A.

01:43:13.554 --> 01:43:15.656
FOLKS WHO ARE TRYING TO PROTECT

01:43:15.722 --> 01:43:17.124
BOTH WORKERS AND THE WORK

01:43:17.190 --> 01:43:18.725
GETTING DONE SHOULD WANT

01:43:18.792 --> 01:43:19.760
SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR WHAT'S

01:43:19.826 --> 01:43:22.195
HAPPENING HERE ALL IT DOES IS

01:43:22.262 --> 01:43:23.964
TAKE PART THIS PART BART.

01:43:24.031 --> 01:43:25.699

INAPPROPRIATE PLACE TO HANDLE

ANY KIND OF LABOR RELATIONS IT

01:43:30.904 --> 01:43:33.473
ACTUALLY PUSHES IT TO COURT.

01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:35.342
AND IT MOVES IT SUPERB WHICH A

01:43:35.409 --> 01:43:36.843
MAJORITY OF OUR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES

01:43:36.910 --> 01:43:38.645

IN THE MIDDLE OF A CONTRACT

01:43:41.882 --> 01:43:44.084
