ILL WHO WILL THAT BE. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR JUST COMPUTERS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND STAFF IS AN ACCESS TO INTERVIEWS THIS ITEM AS YOU SAY- THE SENATE IS CONSIDERING A PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR A PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY ON TO COMPLETE THE BUILD OUT OF THAT SYSTEM THE SYSTEM IS KNOWN AS THE LOS ANGELES REGIONAL INTEROPERABLE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM OR LA REX- WHICH PROVIDES INTEROPERABLE COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL FIRST RESPONDERS. AND LW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND AS YOU STATED MADAM CHAIR THEIR REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE PROJECT I'M IN L. A. COUNTY FAIR TO SPEAK TO THE DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL. THANK YOU MISTER PETERS- WE MOVE ON THEN. TO MR EDSON. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS GOT ITS AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF L. A. RICKS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOUR BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE ON THIS IMPORTANT BUDGET REQUESTS. WHICH IS A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY WITH TEN PUBLIC SAFETY PROFESSIONALS ON ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS. WE ARE REQUESTING EIGHTEEN POINT SIX MILLION AND URGENT ONE TIME STATE FUNDING TO ENSURE COMPLETION OF THE OTHER X. SYSTEM WHICH IS A STATE OF THE ART. NEEDED A RADIO COMMUNICATION SYSTEM FROM LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL FIRST RESPONDERS INCLUDING LAW ENFORCEMENT FIRE AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL AGENCIES. PRIMARY USERS CURRENTLY TESTING THE SYSTEM INCLUDE THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT COUNTY FIRE VARIOUS INDEPENDENT POLICE AGENCIES SEVERAL CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. UCLA AND OTHER PUBLIC AND NONPROFIT ENTITIES. THE PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES THAT SERVE EIGHTY EIGHT CITIES AND THE UNINCORPORATED AREAS OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY CURRENTLY USE A TAX WORK OF AGING RADIO NETWORKS. WHICH CANNOT REALLY TALK TO ONE ANOTHER. WHICH JEOPARDIZE PUBLIC SAFETY. AS AN EXAM IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT WE'RE IN PURSUIT OF AN ARMED CARJACKING SUSPECT GOT ON THE SIX OH FIVE FREEWAY. THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL JOINED THE PURSUIT AND THE PURSUIT EXITED IN THE CITY OF DOWNEY WHERE HE WAS PITTED BY THE CHP. AND EXITED I'M SORRY. BY THE CHP SUSPECT EXITED THE CAR SHOT IN THE HELICOPTER AND THEN RAN INTO A PERSON GETS PRESSED FRONT. GIVEN THE DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS- THE MULTIPLE. LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES INCLUDING THE C. POLICE AND THE LOS ANGELES CA SHERIFF. THE RESTAURANT WAS IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDED HOWEVER NONE OF THOSE AGENCIES WERE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER AND WORK. TO RESPOND TO SHARE THE SUSPECT'S DESCRIPTION- THIS SPECIFIC EXAMPLE DEMONSTRATES THE ENORMOUS GAP IN COMMUNICATIONS FOR OUR PUBLIC SAFETY PARTNERS. SIMPLY PUT DELIVERY SYSTEM ADDRESSES THIS MAJOR INTEROP OF COMMON CATIONS GAP BY PROVIDING A UNIFIED NETWORK OF COMMUNICATIONS. ADDITIONALLY THE COMPLETION OF THE L. A. RICKS SYSTEM NOT ONLY BENEFITS LOS ANGELES COUNTY BUT MANY STATE AGENCIES AS WELL INCLUDING CARILLO YES AND THE C. H. B. THE STATE SYSTEM IS MADE UP OF FOUR SITES WITH OUTDOOR COVERAGE ONLY. THE ONLY RICK SYSTEM IS MADE UP OF FIFTY EIGHT SITES AND STATE USERS WILL BE ABLE TO SEAMLESSLY ROW BETWEEN THE TWO SYSTEMS. THE STATE BENEFITS GREATLY FROM THIS PHENOMENAL COVERAGE AN INDOOR USE OF OUR SYSTEM. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL DURING ROUTINE USE AND DURING MAJOR EVENTS EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS ESPECIALLY SINCE L. A. COUNTY HAS BEEN CLASSIFIED AS THE MOST DISASTER PRONE. COUNTY IN THE COUNTRY. YEAH WHERE X. RADIO SYSTEM. DESIGNED TO FIFTY EIGHT SIDES IS SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE GEOGRAPHICAL FOOTPRINT OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY OVER FOUR THOUSAND SQUARE MILES. INCLUDING THE ANGELES NATIONAL FOREST THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS AND CATALINA ISLAND. AN ESTIMATED ONE HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION HAS ALREADY BEEN SPENT AND LOCAL GRANT FUNDING AND HAS ALREADY ALLOCATED WITH OVER 80% OF THE L. RICS SYSTEM COMPLETED. THE SYSTEM PROVED SUCCESSFUL WHEN TESTED AT SEVERAL DIFFERENT MAJOR EVENTS INCLUDING THE ROSE PARADE AND SUPERBOWL ITSELF AYE STADIUM IN INGLEWOOD JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO- WE MADE GREAT PROGRESS BUILDING OF THE SYSTEM WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED UNFORESEEN DELAYS INCLUDING A SYSTEM REDESIGN. AND WEATHER CONDITIONS WILDLAND FIRES GOBERT NINETEEN A CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE ISSUES WHICH OF ALL CONTRIBUTED TO THE SHORTFALL IN FUNDING. WITHOUT THE STATE PARTNERSHIP AND INVESTMENT OF EIGHTEEN POINT SIX MILLION THE L. L. A. RICH PROJECT WILL BE FORCED TO DEMOBILIZE BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. THIS WOULD NEGATIVELY IN PACK. NOT ONLY RESULT IN SYSTEM A PRICE WITH THE A HUNDRED DOLLARS ALREADY INTO. BUT ALSO PREVENTING SAFETY AGENCIES CALL. YEARS THIS LIKE. NETWORK THE REQUEST RATING POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE STATE PARTNERS WILL PROVIDE CRITICALLY NEEDED FUNDING TO COMPLETE CONSTRUCTION OF THE FINAL SIDE IN THE NETWORK AS WELL AS FULLY TASKED. AN OPTIMIZED THE ENTIRE NETWORK SYSTEM TO ENSURE IT'S READY NEST FOR PUBLIC SAFETY ONCE COMPLETED L. A. RACE WILL PROVIDE COMMUNICATION SERVICES FOR DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS AND FOR A LARGE SCALE EVENTS. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT IRAQ'S THE OPERATIONAL NOW AND FOR FUTURE EVENTS SUCH AS WHEN PEOPLE FROM THROUGHOUT THE WORLD COME TO LOS ANGELES FOR THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. L. A. RACE IS A UNIQUE STATE OF THE ART PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATION SYSTEM THAT WILL BENEFIT OVER TEN MILLION RESIDENTS THE CALLLOS ANGELES COUNTY THEIR HOME BUT ALSO FOR THE MILLIONS OF TOURISTS WHO ANNUALLY COME TO VISIT. THE MANY ATTRACTIONS LOS ANGELES HAS ARE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME CONSIDERATION OF OUR BUDGET REQUEST AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.
