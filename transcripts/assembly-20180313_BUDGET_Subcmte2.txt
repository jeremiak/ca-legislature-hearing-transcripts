GOOD MORNING. WILL BEGIN TODAY'S HEARING OF THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUB COMMANDER TO AN EDUCATION FINANCE. WITH A. S. SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE. AND TODAY OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING THE EARLY EDUCATION. AND. AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND. OTHER AND MISCELLANEOUS. THE. ISSUES RELATED TO ESPECIALLY RELATE ISSUE FOR WE KIND OF HAVE THIS IS A CATCH ALL A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO HAVE IDEAS PROPOSALS TO PUT IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN SPENDING PLAN. AND SO THAT'S REALLY GOING TO HEAR FROM YOU THE PUBLIC ADDITION NUMBER FOUR. AT BEFORE THAT WE WILL BEGIN WITH ISSUE NUMBER ONE MORE ABOUT PROP NINETY EIGHT K. TWELVE ISSUE ABOUT INCENTIVIZING FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN SO. I COME ON UP THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION LA JOH IN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND AS YOU'RE A MAKING YOUR WAY UP JUST TO REITERATE THAT THIS SOB OVERALL BUDGET HEARING IS TO FOCUS THEM ON A. FEW VARIETIES BUT THAT THE FIRST AND FOREMOST I THINK. IS THE EARLY EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA WE KNOW IT'S CRITICAL IN. AT THE SUCCESS OF OUR STATE'S FUTURE AS WELL AS. YOUNGSTERS FUTURE. AND THAT WE KNOW WE'VE COME A LONG WAY THE LAST FEW YEARS. STORING SOME OF THE CUTS IN THE GREAT RECESSION BUT WE HAVE A LONG WAYS TO GO AND IT WILL BEGIN. THAT TODAY'S HEARING WITH THAT IT KEEP IT WOULD THAT TO KEEP IN MIND LOOKING AT OPPORTUNITIES TO RESTORE THESE CRITICAL PROGRAMS FOR CALIFORNIA. SO WITH THAT WE WILL FOCUS ON A FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN AND THAT THE IDEA AND BECAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT LAST YEAR FOLLOWUP ON INCENTIVIZING FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN. I AM GOOD MORNING RYAN ANDERSON OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. SAYS THE CHAIRMANSHIP IN TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUE OF INCENTIVIZING FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN THIS IS A FOLLOW UP FROM SOME SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE THAT THE. LEGISLATURE ENACTED WITH LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. ASKING FIRST CD AND THEN OUR OFFICE TO LOOK AT THIS QUESTION OF. HOW A COMMON IS IT FOR PROGRAMS TO OFFER FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN? AND WHAT COULD THE STATE DUE TO FURTHER INCENTIVIZE PROGRAMS TO SHIFT FROM PART DAY TO FOLD A PROGRAMS. SO CD <u><c.green>.</c></u> CONTRACTED WITH THE TEAM FROM UCLA THEY SURVEYED. NUMBER DISTRICTS ABOUT SIXTY. AND FOUND THAT OF MOST OF THEM ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT WERE ALREADY OFFERING ONLY FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS. OF THE REMAINING FORTY PERCENT ABOUT HALF OF THEM WERE OFFERING A MAKES A FULL DAY IN PART DAY PROGRAMS AND. THE OTHER HALF WERE OFFERING ONLY PART A PROGRAMS. NOW WHAT'S INTERESTING HERE IS THAT. REGARDLESS OF HOW LONG A KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM IS OFFERED THE STATE OFFERS THE SAME PER CHILD FUNDING RATE ON TO THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. SO UNDER STATE LAW. KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS MUST WHAT OPERATE AT LEAST THREE HOURS PER DAY. SOME PROGRAMS OPERATE MORE THAN TWICE AS LONG AS THAT BUT IN ALL CASES REGARDLESS OF HOW LONG THE PROGRAM IS OFFERED. DATE RECEIVE THE SAME PER CHILD FUNDING RIGHT SO I THINK THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS A IN THE LEGISLATURE IS WHETHER THAT POLICY MADE SENSE AND IN PARTICULAR. WHETHER DIFFERENTIATED FUNDING RATES SHOULD BE OFFERED FOR FOLDING PARTY PROGRAMS. NOW. WHAT CD TO HE'S STUDY FOUND WAS THAT EVEN UNDER CURRENT FUNDING POLICIES MOST PROGRAMS ARE OFFERING FULL DAYS? A KINDERGARTEN THAT IN MOST CASES. PROGRAMS THAT ARE NOT FULL DAY. HAVE EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN OFFERING FULL DAY PROGRAMS BUT THEY SAID A LACK OF FACILITIES AS. THAT PRIMARY BARRIER TO OFFERING A FULL DAY PROGRAM. NOW WHAT WE LOOKED AT WAS MORE THE FISCAL SIDE WE ARE INTERESTS IN THIS QUESTION OF WHAT ARE THE PHYSICAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FULL THEY IMPARTED PROGRAMS. AND SOMEWHAT SURPRISINGLY WE FOUND THAT IN MOST CASES. PARTY PROGRAMS DON'T COST THAT MUCH LESS THAN FULL DAY PROGRAMS. NOW IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT A COST OF A KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM IS IT IT CONSISTS OF A NUMBER OF THINGS. START WITH THE CLASSROOM ITSELF. A MATERIALS ADMINISTRATION ALL THESE THINGS TEND TO BE RELATIVELY MINOR ON A PER CHILD BASIS BECAUSE THESE ARE. COSTS THAT ARE SPREAD OUT OVER A NUMBER OF CHILDREN OFTENTIMES OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS. IT ON A PER CHILD BASE IS THE PRIMARY COST IS THE COST OF THE TEACHER WHO'S LEADING THAT CLASSROOM. NOW IN THEORY APART A CLASSROOM COULD SAVE SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE COST OF A TEACHER IN ONE OF TWO WAYS. ONE EIGHT EIGHT COULD HAVE A SINGLE TEACHER LEADING TO CLASSES EVERY DAY IT COULD LEAD. OF MORNING CLASS IN AN AFTERNOON CLASS OR TWO IT COULD EMPLOYEE. THAT TEACHER IN A PART TIME BASIS. NOW WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT NEITHER OF THESE OPTIONS ARE REALLY EXERCISED OFTEN IN CALIFORNIA FIRST. IT'S ACTUALLY AGAINST STATE LAW FOR A KINDERGARTEN TEACHER TO TEACH TO KINDERGARTEN CLASSES IN A SINGLE DAY. WELL NOW IT'S NOT AGAINST STATE LAW TO EMPLOY TEACHERS ON A PART TIME BASIS BUT WE DO FIND THAT IT'S A VERY UNCOMMON PRACTICE IN MOST CASES. EVEN KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS WHO ARE LEADING ONLY A SINGLE PARTY PROGRAM ARE EMPLOYED ON A FULL DAY BASIS WHICH MEANS WHEN THEY'RE NOT LEAVING A CLASSROOM. THE CONDUCTING OTHER ACTIVITIES MAYBE ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES IN MANY CASES THEY'RE SERVING AS AN AID IN ANOTHER PART DAY KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM SO HOW THAT WORKS IS IT WILL BE TO TEACHERS. MISS SINGLE CLASSROOM ONE WILL SERVE AS. THE TEACHER IN THE MORNING AND. IN EIGHT IN THE AFTERNOON OTHER WILL SERVE AS THE EIGHT IN THE MORNING TEACHER AND AFTERNOON. NOW IF YOU'RE FOLLOWING THAT PRACTICE. IT TURNS OUT THAT THE PARTY PROGRAM DOESN'T SAVE THAT MUCH MONEY IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY BECAUSE HE GETS TO SHARE THE CLASSROOM. A AMONG TWO CLASSES OF ABSTINENCE TICKETS TO SHARE EQUIPMENT AND OTHER MATERIALS BETWEEN TWO CLASSES DISTANCE BUT THESE COSTS ARE. RELATIVELY SMALL BETWEEN THE TWO CLASSES. BASED ON THESE FINDINGS FIRST THAT. UNDER CURRENT POLICIES MOST PROGRAMS ARE ALREADY FULL DAY IN SECOND THAT THERE ISN'T A SIGNIFICANT FISCAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. THE COST OF OPERATING FULL TIME PARTY PROGRAMS WE DO THINK THAT THE STATE'S CURRENT FISCAL POLICIES. ARE SUFFICIENT TO INCENTIVIZE FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN BUT THE STATE DOES HAVE SOME OPTIONS IF HE WANTED TO FURTHER INCENTIVIZE HE'S PROGRAMS. FIRST BECAUSE HE BE FOUND AND AND THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE'VE HEARD. FROM THE FIELD THAT IN MOST CASES THE BARRIER TO OFFERING. A FULL DAY PROGRAM IS A LACK OF FACILITY SPACE THE STATE COULD OFFERS SOME FACILITY GRANT SPECIFICALLY FOR PROGRAMS INTEREST IN SHIFTING FROM PART DATE FULL DAY. KINDERGARTEN. A SECOND THE STATE COULD INCENTIVIZE FULL DAY PROGRAMS BY OFFERING A LOWER FUNDING RATE FOR PART A KINDERGARTEN NOW BECAUSE THE COSTS AREN'T SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT. BETWEEN THESE TWO PROGRAMS WHAT WE DON'T THINK THERE'S A. A SINGLE ANALYTICAL ANSWER FOR. WHAT APART DAY RATE SHOULD BE AS OPPOSED TO FULL THEY RATE BUT WE DO THINK? THAT ANY CUT TO THE PARK DAY RATE WOULD OFFER A FURTHER FISCAL INCENTIVES FOR SOME PROGRAMS TO START MOVING TO FOLD A PROGRAMS. I'LL LET THESE THERE. THE A TO OPTIONS THAT HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT. DESIGN ELEMENTS HERE QUESTIONS I WOULD HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED IF YOU GO DOWN THAT PATH AND. A. OF COURSE WILLING TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS BUT. THAT'S ALL MY PAPERS PREPARED REMARKS. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN OF EDUCATION. GOOD MORNING DEBORAH BROWN ON BEHALF A STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TOM TOXIN AYE I'LL JUST BUILD ON WITH THE LA O. M. REPORT WHICH PROVIDED. A GOOD SUMMARY OF WHAT THE AS STUDY FOUND SO WHAT I WOULD JUST LIKE TO DO IS JUST HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF ADDITIONAL POINTS FROM THAT OF EVALUATION SO. WE REALLY AS WE LOOK AT THE RESULTS WE FIND THAT THAT. THE FINDING SUPPORT THE NEED TO LOOK AT HAVING SMALLER CLASS SIZES AND ART ARE BETTER AT TEACHER TO TO CHILD RATIOS EITHER THROUGH. I'M HAVING IT AN ADDITIONAL TEACHER IN THE TO BEST SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF. THAT FORTY QUE AND THEN ALSO APART DAY PROGRAMS ABOUT DO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS DOES HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE. DISTRICTS THAT ARE ALREADY HAVING A FACILITY SHORTAGE WHICH IS LEADING TO THEM NOT BEING ABLE TO IMPLEMENT A OR RESTRICTING THEIR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT FULL DAY PROGRAM. I'M ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT THAT WAS ALSO INTERESTING WAS. MAKE SURE THAT WE CONSIDERING THE DIFFERENTIATION AND FULL DAY VERSUS PART THEY'VE WORKED PRETTY QUE SO WE HOPE SO THE REPORT SHOWED THAT SOME OF THE TEACHERS FELT THAT. WHILE THEY WOULD LIKE FULL DAY FOR KINDERGARTEN IT WAS NOT NECESSARILY APPROPRIATE FOR I'M. T. CASE STUDENTS AND SO MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT THAT WHEN WE WHEN WE DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN INCENTIVES FOR FULL DAY. AYE CANDOR AND T. K. I'M ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WAS REALLY THAT THAT I KEY FOR AYE NEEDING SOME SOCIAL EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT INCLUDING AND SO. HOW AND ACTIONS AND SO PROVIDING MORE SUPPORT FOR TEACHERS COME AROUND THOSE AND WAYS TO BETTER INTEGRATE BOTH THE AT KINDERGARTEN STANDARDS AND THEN THE LEARNING FOUNDATIONS? AND WILL ALSO LOOK AT DIFFERENT WAYS TO CONCERT TO PROVIDE PLANNING SUPPORT FOR A DISTRICTS IS THAT SO THAT THEY COULD TRANSIT TRANSITION TO A FULL DAY PROGRAM SO NOT ONLY THINKING ABOUT. PROPS BEST PRACTICES FOR FOR ADDRESSING HAVING THAT THE FACILITIES CONSTRAINTS ON IN THE CLASSROOM SUPPORT. I'M A PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE LA RECOMMENDATIONS THAT I THINK THAT THE. RECOMMENDATION FROM THE ALLEY SOME. SUPPORT OR INCENTIVE FUNDING THROUGH EITHER GRANTS OR LOANS ON THE FACILITIES WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR THE STATE TO. TO A SUPPORT TO THAT THAT WOULD REMOVE AT LEAST THAT ONE BARRIER LIMIT THAT BARRIER TO IMPLEMENTATION. AND WE WOULD ALSO SUGGEST RATHER LOOKING AT OTHER OPTIONS AND SUPPORTS FOR ENCOURAGING MORE FULL DAY RATHER THAN LOOKING AT REDUCING THAT. THAT RATE FOR. FOR AYE KINDERGARTEN AYE FOR APART DAY PROGRAM SO WE GET EIGHTY CAN COULD INCLUDE AN ONGOING INCENTIVE FUNDING FOR EVEN ONE TIME PLANNING SUPPORTER MULTIYEAR PLANNING SUPPORT RATHER THAN ONGOING FUNDING. AND THEN I WOULD SAY IN RESPONSE TO THAT QUESTION POSED IN THE ANALYSIS THAT. ABOUT HOW WE COULD UTILIZE THIS INFORMATION AND PERHAPS DO LOOK AT THE STUDY FOR FUTURE CONSIDERATION UNTIL ULTIMATELY I THINK WE THOUGHT THAT THAT. THAT THAT EVALUATION WAS A GOOD ONE BECAUSE IT WAS MULTIFACETED SO IT INCLUDED THE SURVEYS THE INTERVIEWS AND THEN ALSO THE CLASSROOM OBSERVATIONS. AND WE COULD REPLICATE THAT BY AND DOING THAT EVERY TWO TO FOUR YEARS IN THE ADVANTAGE TO THAT WOULD BE YOU WOULD GET ON A LITTLE BIT MORE LONG TERM DATA BUT WE CAN ALSO PERHAPS MEASURE. THE IMPACT IN TWO TO FOUR YEARS AROUND THAT THE RECENT CHANGES FOR IT CASE NAMELY THAT CHANGE THAT JUST TOOK AFFECT AROUND NOT HAVING TO HAVE TEA QUE QUE BEING. THE SAME TIME FINANCE. GOOD MORNING INTERNET MEDIA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD LIKE TO JUST KNOW THAT WE SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. WE DON'T HAVE A PROPOSAL SPECIFIC TO THIS ISSUE AT THIS POINT BUT BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU. ALL START OFF WITH WITH THE LA OUT FACT I GUESS THERE'S IS TWO FOLD IS THAT ONE IF YOU WANTED. TO TO DO SOMETHING WHAT YOU WHAT WOULD YOU DO AND TALK ABOUT A COUPLE OPTIONS BUT. FRICKE FROM YEAR BENEFIT FOR. FOR CALIFORNIA AND FOR THE FAMILIES AND AND. THE STUDENTS AS FAR AS A SCHOOL READINESS AB WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK THE OVERALL VALUE OF DOING SOMETHING LIKE. THIS WOULD BE TO TO FURTHER. INCENTIVIZE AND PUSH THE OTHER FORTY PERCENT TO GO FULL DAY. PHONE SO ASIDE SAY THEY'RE THEY'RE TWO PARTS TO THAT QUESTION ONE IS WHAT IS THE VALUE OF INCENTIVIZING FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN AND TWO IS. A WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO APPROACH THAT AT SAINT ON THE FIRST QUESTION THAT LITERATURE IS ACTUALLY A LITTLE MIXED A. THE LITERATURE. MANY STUDIES HAVE LOOKED AT. WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS GENERATED BY A FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN AND IN MANY CASES THEY FIND THAT WHILE THERE ARE POSITIVE BENEFITS? AND IN TERMS OF STE STUDENTS WHO ATTEND FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS TO HAVE HIGHER TEST SCORES IN LATER GRADES. THE BENEFITS ARE WITHA IN MANY CASES RATHER MARGINAL. AT SO THAT QUESTION DOES BECOME IT HOW HIGH OF A PRIORITY SHOULD THIS BE. NOW. IT IS THE CASE IN MANY STATES A. THERE ARE DIFFERENT PRACTICES AROUND HELD KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS ARE STRUCTURED IN PARTICULAR. AND MANY STATES PART DAY PROGRAMS ARE RUN SUCH THAT ONE TEACHER WILL BRIGHTEN A MORNING CLASS ONE WALDRON AN AFTERNOON CLASS THAT MEANS THAT THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT. COST DIFFERENCE IN PROVIDING THESE PROGRAMS AND THAT'S ALSO SOMETHING OF THE STUDIES TYPICALLY TAKE IT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT SO THE STUDIES. MANY CASES SAY. WHAT IS THE ADDED COST OF RUNNING A FULL DAY PROGRAM VERSES THE ADDED BENEFIT AND THEY WILL FIND IN SOME CASES THAT? THAT THE COST OUTWEIGHS THE BENEFIT THIS PROBABLY NOT THE CASE IN CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OUR PART DAY PROGRAMS. TEND TO COST ABOUT AS MUCH AS A FULL DAY PROGRAM SO EVEN ON A MARGINAL. IT IMPROVEMENT AND BENEFITS WILL PROBABLY OUTWEIGH THE COST OF A. FURTHER ENCOURAGING FULL DAY PROGRAMS. NOW WITH THAT IN MIND THE QUESTION BECOMES WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO INCENTIVIZE OF FULL DAY PROGRAM A. WE THINK THAT THE APPROACH THAT IS BEST TARGETED TO THE SPECIFIC PROBLEM THAT WE'RE HEARING FROM THE FIELD IS SOMETHING TO ADDRESS AT THE AVAILABILITY OF FACILITY SPACES. NOW THAT COULD BE STRUCTURED IN MANY WAYS IT IT COULD BE. A A GRANT PROGRAM I COULD BE A LOAN PROGRAM UNFORTUNATELY CAN'T BE A CARVE OUT FROM THE EXISTING PROP FIFTY ONE FUND FUNDING BECAUSE OF RESTRICTIONS A A IN THE LANGUAGE OF THAT. PROPOSITION BUT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE MANY OPTIONS IF IT WAS INTERESTING THAT. AND THEN AS FAR AS THE BENEFITS YOU KNOW THERE'S THE ACADEMIC BENEFITS BUT OF COURSE THERE'S FAMILY BENEFITS AND. CHILD CARE CONSIDERATIONS IN. HAVING THREE DAYS OR THREE HOURS THAT THAT YOU KNOW. SOMETHING FREE FOR YOUR CHILD TO DO VERSUS FIVE. WORKER PARA OR MORE. YEAH I THINK THAT'S A FAIR POINT AND IT. DOES NOT APPEAR TO ME THAT THE LITERATURE OFTEN TRIES TO QUANTIFY THOSE BENEFITS OF THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT'S MISSING FROM. THE CURRENT LITERATURE. OKAY. QUESTIONS. YES MISTER MADONNA SO SO WHY DO WE WANT WILL A CANDOR I'M STILL STRUGGLING WITH THIS. IT SEEMS TO ME. THAT. OUR OUR CHILDREN ENTER THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP WOULD BENEFIT MORE FROM FULL DAY CANTOR THAN THOSE WHO ART. DO WE HAVE EIGHT DOT DATA RELATIVE TO THAT BECAUSE WHERE I COME FROM AS IT SHOULD BE AN EDUCATIONAL OF HEARD. IT SHOULDN'T BE ABOUT DAYCARE WHEN I HEAR PEOPLE WANT DAYCARE. DAYCARES EXPENSIVE I GET IT BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT'S NECESSARILY ALWAYS THE STATE'S OBLIGATION. SHOULD BE ABOUT EDUCATION NOT ABOUT JUST PROVIDING. YEAH DAYCARE FOR THE FULL DAY I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I LIKE MY OWN CHILDREN WENT TO PARTY. DOING FINE BUT I KNOW THAT WE ALSO HAVE HAVES YOU KNOW SUMMER TO FALL INTO THE CHIMNEY CAP THAT I IMAGINE WOULD VERY MUCH BENEFIT FROM CALLED A CANTOR. SUCH AS I MEAN IT TO HEAR THE WORDS MOSTLY RESTORING THERE'S A REAL PROBLEM OUT THERE WOULD IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT THE SOLUTIONS. YEAH I WILL SAY THAT THE WOULD IT SURE DOES OF SUGGEST THAT THERE ARE ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN MAY JUST TEND TO BE RATHER SMALL. NOW I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH ANY STUDIES THAT SPECIFICALLY LOOK AT ARE THOSE BENEFITS LARGER FOR CERTAIN POPULATIONS OF STUDENTS FOR EXAMPLE LOW INCOME STUDENTS ENGLISH LEARNERS SO. THAT I AM AFRAID I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT SPECIFIC SHOULD AGAIN THANK YOU I I JUST THINK WE SHOULD FOCUS ON CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. RATHER THAN PROVIDING DAYCARE THAT'S WHY BECOME A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS. AND IF WE NEED TO PUSH MORE DOLLARS. INTO THOSE CLASSROOMS THAT HAD TO HAVE THOSE STUDENTS THAT ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE. TO FALL UNDER THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP THAT'S WHERE WE SHOULD GO WITH THEIR DOLLARS THAT'S WHERE WE SHOULD GO WITH THEIR EFFORT NOT JUST PROVIDING DAYCARE I GET IT IS APPARENT. IT'S EXPENSIVE I'D LOVE FOR THE STATE TO PAY FOR IT BUT THE SAME TIME I THINK A PURSUIT PURPOSE HEARS ABOUT CLOSING THAT ACHIEVEMENT GAP. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAVEZ. YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD THIS DISCUSSION ON. THE ROLE OF. EARLY KAGYU DEVELOPMENT CHILDREN FOR A NUMBER YEARS CHAIR AND I THINK. BOTH REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATS HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THIS AREAS OF AN ISSUE. BUT I'M GONNA GO BACK TO. THE TERM USED EARLIER ON THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING THEIR CHILDREN. THE. IS THERE ANY STUDIES IT. SHOW HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE A WHAT WHAT IS THE BEST SETTING FOR THIS IS IT. IS IT EIGHT HOURS IS FOUR HOURS WHAT IS ANYTHING THAT SHOWS. FOR THE CHILD. ABILITY TO. IBM HAD DIRECTED SYSTEM. WHAT IS THE WEB'S BEST? EXPERIENCE. A I'M NOTPERSONALLY FAMILIAR WITH ANY OF THAT I I WILL SAY I WERE. A. THE AT THE LA O. OUR PRIMARY INTEREST IN LOOKING AT THIS QUESTION WAS ON THE FISCAL SIDE SO WE WERE WE WERE NOT AROUND YOU. YET STEP AROUND A YET I DIDN'T SORT OF BUILDING ON ON MR O'DONNELL'S COMMENT AS WELL JUST IF I REALLY THINK WHAT WE FOUND AS WE LOOK AT AND I CAN'T SPEAK TO ANY OTHER. BUT STUDIES BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY LOOK INTO BUT AS AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THE EVALUATION AND THE RESPONSES FROM THAT THAT THAT TEACHERS. WHAT THEY FOUND WAS REALLY JUST THIS IDEA UPS PARTICULARLY WHEN WE HAVE CLASS SIZES AS LARGE AS THEY ARE THAT HAVING THE FULL DAY PROGRAM SO THAT YOU KNOW IF OF? MORE THAN FOUR HOURS ALLOW THEM MORE TIME TO NOT ONLY GO OVER THE THAT THAT CONTENT STANDARDS WITH THEM WITH THEIR WITH THEIR STUDENTS BUT THEN ALSO SPEND MUCH TIME ON SOME OF THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING AS WELL. AND THE IDEA THAT THEY COULD TAKE WHAT ONE TEACHER THAT TURNED IN THE IN THE EVALUATION BRAIN BREAKS SO IT SO HAVING THAT THE FULLER DAY PROGRAM. GAVE THEM MORE TIME AGAIN IT IT IT INCLUDED A MULTIPLE OF FACTORS NAMELY ONE STARTING WITH LARGE CLASS SIZES BUT THE WHOLE AND THEY NEEDED MORE TIME BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LARGER CLASS EXACTLY SO MAYBE HE ANSWERS A SMALLER CLASS SIZE. MISS REGARDING ANY KIND OF THIS ARE DOMINANT IN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MY CHILD I WENT THROUGH A TWENTY TO ONE A MUCH OTHER WINTER THIRTY FIVE TO ONE THEIR PERFORMANCE EVEN TODAY. THEREIN LIES THE AND THAT THE SUMMERS EFFECT. CHAVEZ IS. I SPOKE TO MY COMMENTS SO I JUMPED AND I APOLOGIZE. YOU DID REFERENCE MY COMP SO I TOOK THE LIBERTY I APOLOGIZE. GET IT WILL MAKE SURE WE KNOW WHAT THE RULES ARE THE. I WANTED TO GO ON THE ISSUE OF A PARENTAL CHOICE NOW. WHAT IF THE PARENTS WANT TO THEIR ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE? EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHILDREN'S. WHERE THEY LEANING TO? I'D SALUTE CD IS A STUDY WAS REALLY FOCUSED ON FISCAL PERSPECTIVE. AT SO. THAT PARENTAL INPUT WOULD ONLY BE IN DIRECTLY FROM WHAT IT SCHOOLS THINK THAT PARENTS ONE I I DO THINK THAT THE GENERAL IMPRESSION IS THAT. PARENTAL INTEREST IN MOST COMMUNITIES THE TRIPS TOWARDS THE FULL DAY PROGRAMS FOR MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP. IN PREVIOUS COMMENTS HERE ABOUT JUST IT CAN BE INCONVENIENT FOR PARENTS WERE WORKING TO. HAVE TO PICK UP. A CHILD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY YOU MAKE AN ECONOMIC ARGUMENT WILL BETTER THE PARENTS WANT AS FAR AS A SOCIAL EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHILDREN. I I DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON ON ON THAT AT THE MAKE AND AS MISTER ANDERSON SAID THIS STUDY WAS REALLY AROUND WHAT TEACHERS AND AND SCHOOL LEADERS WANTED I CAN CHECK TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANYTHING. THAT THAT QUANTIFIES HOW PARENTS FEEL ABOUT THE LONGER DAY VERSES THAT THE SHORTER DAY BUT I THINK THE OTHER ISSUE IS REALLY FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE MORE TIME AT SCHOOL IT IS EASIER FOR THEM. MS BROWN WHICH IS AS FAR AS THE COST OF THE. OR PAY FOR QUALITY TEACHERS IN THESE PROGRAMS. ARE THEY COMPATIBLE TO LET'S SAY A FIRST OR SECOND GRADE. TEACHER WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT TO PAY FOR. SO I I BELIEVE THE ANSWER IS E. IS YES ALTHOUGH THAT THAT IS PART OF A AT DISTRICTS A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT. SO WHAT'S WHAT'S YOUR VIEW EITHER WHEN YOU KNOW ACROSS THE STATE. SOMEBODY'S GOING IN THESE PROGRAMS ARE THEY PAID COMPARABLE TO. YES IN MOST CASES. ALL MULTIPLE SUBJECTS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHERS ARE PAID ON A UNIFORM SALARY SCHEDULE BASED ON THEIR EXPERIENCE AND EDUCATION. SO THE ONLY DIFFERENCE THEN IS. OF THEREFORE OUR CLASS OR NAY TO OUR CLIENTS NO ACTUALLY IN MOST CASES I'D EVEN IF YOU'RE A TEACHER WHO'S LEADING ONLY A FOUR HOUR CLASS. AS LONG AS YOUR. EMPLOYED ON A FULL TIME BASIS YOU'RE RECEIVING THE SAME SALARY AS SAY A THIRD GRADE TEACHER. SO THE FACT THAT WAS ONE MY CONCERNS ALSO IS THE MAKE SURE THAT THE. I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE. QUALIFIED TEACHERS IN THERE IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE. PREPARED BEING GIVEN ALL THE TRAINING AND AND ALL THE SKILLS TO BE THE BEST LIKE AND THEIR. AND THE LAST STATEMENT I'LL JUST MAKE A STATEMENT NOT A. MIA DANCERS THE FACT THAT. RESERVE WAYNE AND I THINK SO HEAVILY IN THIS IS IT DEMANDS IN OUR SOCIETY TODAY WITH SINGLE PARENT FAMILIES YOU KNOW DUAL FAMILY WORK GAME. WHEN THEY WERE CHILDREN GOING TO BE IN. AND IN AN IDEAL SITUATION THE CARE BE AGREES THAT. YOU KNOW OF OF A CHILD WE AT HOME DEVELOP AND LEARN AT THEIR OWN LEVEL AND WHATEVER ISSUES ARE BUT WE KNOW THAT. THAT'S NOT REALITY ME IN MANY OF OUR NOW. COMMUNITIES THAT ARE STRESS ECONOMICALLY. AND THAT IN ITSELF COST AGAINST GOING TO CHILDREN WE KNOW THAT THE OBJECTIVE IS THAT WHEN THE CHILDREN. DOES GO TO SCHOOL. YOU KNOW FIRST. THAT THEY'RE PREPARED TO DO THAT INTO MANY OF OUR CHILDREN SPECIAL COLOR GOING TO SCHOOL THEY'RE NOT PREPARED BECAUSE OF THEIR. ECONOMIC SITUATIONS I. I THINK THIS IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THING WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS. THIS MY SIXTY YEAR HERE HERE AND THE SONG DISCUSSION SHOULD WE DO IT. WE WANT TO DO IT. I THINK WHAT YOU NEED WHERE TO POINT NOW IS. ARE WE BEING SUCCESSFUL IN IT. AND HOW MUCH MORE MONEY TO WE GOTTA PUT INTO IT. IN. AND THIS IS A QUESTION YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE SCORECARD COMING OUT. IS THIS PART OF THE EVALUATION AND MISS BROWN IS. AS WERE EVALUATING YOU KNOW THE. SUCCESS AN EDUCATION IS IS BEING MEASURE GAP. SECOND CARE WE ARE REFERENCING THAT THE CALIFORNIA THAT SCHOOL DASHBOARD YET SO AND. YOU THE ANSWER IS YES AND NO BECAUSE WE'D WE ALSO DON'T HAVE WE DON'T ADMINISTER THE AND STATEWIDE ASSESSMENTS UNTIL THIRD GRADE SO IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT ACADEMIC COMPONENT. BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT SCHOOLS ARE USING I'M THEIR OWN. AT ADDITIONAL INDICATES OR DISTRICTS ARE USING AYE INDICATORS A LOCALLY DETERMINATE ACHE INDICATORS THEY COULD CERTAINLY LOOK AT THAT THERE'S ALSO OTHER INDICATORS. AROUND AND CONDITIONS AND CLIMATE BUT AROUND THE ACADEMICS PER SE IT'S NOT PART OF THAT BECAUSE WE DON'T DO THIS STATEWIDE ASSESSMENTS ABOUT GREAT. SO THE ANSWER IS A FROM A PARENT. DO I BE ABLE TO GO TO ANYWHERE TO SEE HOW WELL THE SCHOOL DON'T. E. YOU CAN BUT IF YOU'RE TRYING TO LOOK JUST SOLELY AT KINDERGARTEN IT'S IT'S NOT MEASURED IN AND THAT WAY THE SAME AS IT IS. IN THE UPPER GRADES. SHOWS NO. RIGHT IT THOR EDGAR CALLED THE LEADS THAT ABOUT FIVE IF I WOULD HAVE MEANT THAT I THINK. THAT THEM MOST OF SHOULD TO BE TAUGHT THEM THEY HAVE SOME KIND OF MEASUREMENT THAT THEY'RE DOING IT THEY KINDERGARTEN FIRST GRADE SECOND GRADE SURVEY. IF FOR EXAMPLE THEIR THIRD GRADE TEST SCORES ARE NOT ARE NOT GREAT THEY MIGHT LOOK AND SAY OKAY WHERE DO WE THINK THE START AND IN SOME CASES THAT MIGHT. MEAN BEING ABLE TO SAY OKAY WE THINK THAT THEY SHOW UP IN CANADA ARE NOT PREPARED AND AND I THINK RIGHT NOW WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE. WE'RE NOT USING ANY ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURE KINDERGARTEN BUT DEFINITELY A. MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS PART OF WHAT WILL BE HEARD OF THEIR THEIR ACTIONS ARE TAKING TO TRY TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR THEIR STUDENTS IN THE LONG RUN. IF THE FOCUS MORE ON AYE MICKEY IMPROVEMENT THAT YOU CAN EARN RTK FIRST GRADE. BUT IT'S NOT. BECAUSE WE DON'T START MEASURING THE BETH BACK TO THE SORT OF THIRD GRADE WE DON'T HAVE SORT OF THIS. THIRD PERFORMANCE MEASURE THAT WE LOOK AT THE GET THE CONVERT RATE WE'VE NEVER HAD ANYTHING AT THAT AT THAT EARLY IN THE. EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. REFRESH MY MEMORY. WE STARTED DOING TO T. K. WHEN. TWENTY TEN GUY I THINK THE FIRST COHORT WITH ELEVEN TWELVE BUT THAT WAS THAT WAS ONLY ONE MONTH SO SO RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW IT'S THREE MONTHS UPELIGIBILITY IS WITHIN A THREE MONTH WINDOW AT FIRST IT WAS JUST. ONE MONTH OF ELIGIBILITY WE SORT OF A FAITH THAT IN SO THAT I THINK FIVE A. IT'S LIKE THE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN YEAR WHEN WE HAD THE FOR FULL COOPER AS WE HAD NO CAME FOURTEEN AND SO. SO THE CHILDREN WHO AND FOURTEEN RIGHT NOW IF THEY'RE IN THERE AND THIRD GRADES WILL BE ABLE TO SEE. HOW IT'S GOING IS THAT CORRECT? I THINK THAT THE THIRD YEAR NOW STARTING TO GET A STUDENTS WHO WERE INTRODUCED NUCLEAR AND WHEN OUR IN THIRD GRADE AND WE'RE STARTING TO FEE. THAT WE WOULD HAVE. ASPECTS COURSE FOR THEM THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT HAVE YOU NOTICED THE IMPACT YET. I DON'T THINK I MEAN WE HAVE I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S ANYTHING SPECIFIC THING THAT WE CAN FEED THAT'S TIED TO THE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN. YOU KNOW I WE ALSO IN THAT DURING THAT PERIOD ALSO CHANGE STEPHENS WILL HAVE THREE YEARS WORTH OF TEST WE HAVE SEEN. FROM THE FIRST FROM FIRST YOU'RE THINKING YOU'RE A BIG INCREASE IN AFFECT SCORES A LOT MORE FLAT IN FROM A AND FROM THE SECOND TO THE THIRD YEAR. SOME OF THAT THAT I I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OF THAT WE COULD TIED TO WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON AT THE TO KILL BUT VERY SOMETHING THAT. RIGHT ASSUMING THAT THAT DISTRICTS COULD BE LOOKING AT BECAUSE DISTRICTS WILL NOW HAVE BOTH STUDENTS WHO ARE WHO WERE TO QUE STUDENT INSTANCE WE'RE NOT TAKING STUDENTS IN THE FAME CLASSROOMS IN. SECOND THIRD FOURTH GRADE TO YOU THAT THERE MAY BE A A CONSENT THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE ABOUT BENEFITS. I WILL HAVE A HEARING LATER ON WAS SUMMONED AND. EDUCATORS THAT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED THIS FOR FOUR YEARS IT COULD GIVE THAT OBSERVATION. ANTITANK PARA. SURE WHEN WE HEAR THE PROP NINETY EIGHT SIDE THAT I THINK THAT CERTAINLY SOMETHING TO CONSIDER WE DID AGENDA IS THIS THE LAST COUPLE YEARS YOU HAD AT A PANEL ON. T. K. HOW IT'S WORKING AND I WILL SAY THAT. THE A OUR STUDY CAME OUT TUESDAYS IN LAST. EIGHTEEN MONTHS SEWING JACK TREMENDOUS SUCCESS OF TEA QUE. IN THE IN THE COURT OF THE KIDS THAT WERE IN THE TICKET CLASSROOMS AND WILL CONTINUE TO TO TO TALK ABOUT THAT. THIS THIS IS S. FOCUS PRIMARILY TODAY ON THE EARLY AT PROPOSALS AND WE DID PUT IN. THIS PIECE I'M KIND OF AT. THE HYBRID WHAT INSPIRES. A FULL DAY QUE THANK YOU. SOME REMEMBER LIMON. I THINK YOU AND I REGRET THAT I AM JOINING THE CONVERSATION A LATE THAT FROM MY AYE. BECAUSE I ALSO KIND OF WANTING TO COMMENT ON. IN. WHAT THE EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES MIGHT BE RIGHT SO THERE'S THE PIECE THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED WHICH IS THE INVESTMENT THE FINANCIAL INVESTMENT WE MAKE IN LOOKING INTO AT A FULL DAY PROGRAM? ANY THINK THAT AT LEAST FOR ME MY THOUGHTS ON WHETHER THE INVESTMENT. IT IS THE RIGHT APPROACH ALSO DEPENDS ON THE OUTCOMES WE GET AND I THINK THAT THERE'S BEEN. A LOT OF RESEARCH ON EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAMS EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS AND THE IMPACT THEY HAVE PARTICULARLY ON FIRST NATION COLLEGE BOUND. STUDENTS COMING FROM LOW INCOME BACKGROUNDS AND. I YOU I THINK YOU MENTIONED THE ASSESSMENT. CASE THAT CASE I AM I MAKING THAT UP IS THAT I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A AT LEAST IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AS A PART OF A SCHOOL BOARD WE DID HAVE A KINDERGARTEN ASSESSMENT TEST. AND THAT'S HOW. IT YOU KNOW IT'S WHEN YOU SIT DOWN SHAPES EITHER THE I MEAN I SAT THROUGH THEM AND WATCH THEM. AND. THERE WAS A CLEAR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. STUDENTS WHO HAD A PRIOR BY YOU KNOW WHETHER IT WAS T. K. OR PRESCHOOL OPPORTUNITIES VERSUS THOSE THAT DIDN'T. I MEAN YOU HAVE THE FIRST FIVE MODEL THAT CONSTANTLY TALKS ABOUT THE THREE YOU KNOW MILLION WORDS THAT STUDENTS ARE NOT EXPOSED TO IF THEY DON'T HAVE AN EARLY CHILDHOOD CHILDHOOD KIND OF EDUCATION PROGRAM. AND SO I JUST DON'T KNOW IF WE COULD COMMENTS A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE EXPECTED OUTCOME FOR AN INVESTMENT UNLIKE THIS THAT THERE ENOUGH THERE'S A FINANCIAL INVESTMENT BUT. THE OUTCOME OF TRANSITIONING TO FULL DAY AND WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A BELIEF THAT I. THAT THIS WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE A GREATER IMPACT ON. FIRST GENERATION LOW INCOME STUDENTS AS OPPOSED TO STUDENTS UP TO OTHER STUDENTS. A. YEAH. SO. I I WOULD SAY THAT THE BILL OF LITERATURE THAT'S WILL DONE SPECIFICALLY THE QUESTION OF THE ACADEMIC BENEFITS FOR A FULL DAY VERSES PARTY PROGRAMS HAS GENERALLY CONCLUDED THAT THERE ARE BENEFITS FOR FULL DAY PROGRAMS BUT THEY TEND TO BE QUITE SMALL. CERTAIN THAT SPECIFICALLY STUDENTS TO ATTEND A FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM TEND TO DO BETTER ON TEST SCORES IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS BUT THE IMPROVEMENT IS A IS IN MANY CASES MARGINAL. AND I WOULD JUST ADD THAT YOU THAT YOU ARE CORRECT THERE ARE A VARIETY OF KINDERGARTEN READINESS ASSESSMENTS THE CASE THAT BEING ONE OF ON THE DEPARTMENT HAS ONE. CALLED THE DESIRED RESULTS DEVELOPMENTAL PROFILES SO THERE ARE A VARIETY OF ASSESSMENTS THAT YOU CAN GIVE. TIP PRESCHOOLERS AND AND THEN STUDENTS ENTERING T. CARE QUE THAT ASSESS THEIR KINDERGARTEN READINESS. AND I WILL NOTE THE SOMEONE MARILYN ON THAT THAT NEXT THREE ITEMS ARE REALLY GET INTO THE LARGER QUESTION ON. I PREPARATION SUCCESS FOR OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS SO WITH THAT SCRIPTURE CAN ADJUST MATHIS O'DONNELL QUESTION A COMMENT BUT AGAIN. I THINK. WHERE I COME FROM IS I I WANT TALK ABOUT THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP OF MARENGO FOR WITH THIS EFFORT NEEDS TO BE ABOUT CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP? AND I DON'T KNOW THAT I'VE HEARD ANY STUDIES. CITED TODAY RELATIVE TO THAT QUESTION BUT I ALSO THINK YOU KNOW WE OUGHT TO THINK ABOUT SOME OTHER THINGS IN THIS ROOM IS FULL THEY CAN HER ONE TEACHER. AT A LOT OF PREPARATION FOR ONE TEACHER BECAUSE KINDERGARTNERS ARE USING THEIR HANDS ARE CUTTING UP THINGS. THAT THERE'S JUST A LOT OF TEACHER PREPARATION THAT GOES IN TO THE KINDERGARTEN DENTICLE HE AS I RECALL HAVING MEDICAID FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. THE KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS WHO TEACH OUR CLASS YES THEN THEY GO INTO ANOTHER CLASSROOM. SPEND SOME TIME IN THERE WITH MAYBE THE AFTERNOON CLASS. AND THEN THEY'D HAVE MAYBE AN HOUR MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO GO OUT PREPARE FOR THE NEXT DAY. I JUST DON'T ONE UNDERSCORE HOW MUCH PREPARATION IS REQUIRED HANDS ON PREPARATION IS REQUIRED FOR TEACHING A KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM AND PUT THAT ALL ON ONE PERSON. SEE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THIRTY FIVE KIDS THIRTY EIGHT KIDS FOR SEVEN HOURS OF THE DAY. AND THEN YOU'VE GOT TO PREPARE FOR THE NEXT DAY AFTER THAT DATE JUST THERE'S A LOT THERE'S A LOT OF LOGISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT BUT THAT THAT CLASSROOM. MOVE FOR THE STUDENTS BY BY THAT BY THAT KINDERGARTEN TEACHER SO JUST PLEASE THINK OF THAT THINK OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO THE TEACHER WHEN YOU DO THAT. OKAY WITH THAT. WE'LL CALL THAT PUBLIC COMMENT BUT ON THE WAY UP. I WILL NOTE THAT THANKFULLY WITH ELSE IF THAT A COUPLE YEARS AGO WE HAVE LOWERED. THE CLASS SIZES TO THE YOUNGER GRADES BUT NOT TO THE DEGREE THAT THEY WERE LOWER THEY NOT QUE WHERE ONE TO TWENTY ALLEN NOW OR WHAT MAYBE TODAY ONE TO TWENTY SIX IN SOME DISTRICTS IN SOME DISTRICTS DON'T EVEN HAVE CLASS SIZE REDUCTION SO. OKAY YEAH PUBLIC COMMENT CAN YOU LINE UP IF ANYBODY WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AND DOES ARE DOING THAT WE WILL TAKE ALL. MCCARTY. HERE. CHáVEZ THERAPY MOAN HERE MEDINA MURATSUCHI O'DONNELL YOUR VOEPEL LOOK. OKAY SING NO PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ISSUE WILL GET TO THE NEXT ISSUE ON LICENSING THIS WAS A BIG PROPOSAL LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. AS FAR AS THAT THE PRESCHOOL LICENSING PROPOSAL RELATE TO. T. K. AND AND. PRESCHOOL CLASSROOMS. AND WE HAVE THE LA OUT AFFIRMATIVE AT CURRENT FINANCE AS WELL AS PUBLIC COMMENT. GOOD MORNING I'M. EVERY. GOOD MORNING EVER COULD BOTH THE LEADS THAT AROUND WITH A FIFTH UMPIRE I WAS. I'M GONNA PROVIDE SOME BACKGROUND ON. THE FAKE OUR OUR RECOMMENDATIONS FROM A WORK GROUP THAT I WE WERE ASKED TO PROVIDE. WHAT TO DO WITH PART OF THE US SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT LEGISLATION? ARE AND THIS IS ALL RELATED TO. THE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS FOR STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS THAT ARE OPERATED BY ELEAZAR IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. AND THAT ARE LOCATED ON ELLIOTT FLAGS LA FACILITIES. I'M SO JUST VERY QUICK BACKGROUND IN TERMS OF WHAT THE LIFE WE THING A LICENSING RULES AND STANDARDS ARE NOW WE HAVE TO SET THE STANDARDS OUT ONE ARE KNOWN AS TITLE TWENTY TO. OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS THESE ARE THE STANDARDS THAT APPLY TO. ALL LICENSED PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE AND THAT INCLUDES BOTH WEBSITE PROGRAMS AND AB PRIVATE PAY PROGRAMS ALL ACROSS THE STATE. I'M THESE ARE AGAIN FOCUSED ON HEALTH AND SAFETY ARM AND THEY'RE ADMINISTERED OUT THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES COMMUNITY CARE LICENSINGI'D DOES THE MISSILE LIKE SOMETHING AND THEN THEY DO A. OF VISITS THROUGHOUT A RANDOM VISITS AND THEY ALSO DO VISITS. RELATED TO. COMPLAINTS. AND THEN WE HAVE ANOTHER SET OF STANDARDS KNOWN AS TITLE FIVE STANDARDS WHICH ARE MORE ABOUT. MORE DEVELOPMENTAL STANDARD THERE ABOUT PROGRAM CURRICULUM AND THEY APPLY SPECIFICALLY TO UP PROGRAMS THAT CONTRACT DIRECTLY WITH THE STATE AND THE THE BIGGEST PROGRAM IS THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. I'D THROW IT IN THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET THERE WAS TRAILER LEGISLATION THAT. THAT EXEMPTED. STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS OPERATED BY ELEAZAR AND RUN ON LTA FACILITIES. I'M FROM. THESE TITLE TWENTY TWO HEALTH AND FIFTY STANDARDS AND IT WAS THE ONLY TO FALL THE TITLE FIVE DEVELOPMENT OF STANDARDS. AT THIS EXEMPTION WAS TO TAKE EFFECT JULY FIRST OF TWENTY NINETEEN. SO FELLOW BUT MORE THAN A YEAR FROM NOW I'M IN THE LEGISLATION REQUIRED OUR OFFICE TO CAMINO STAKEHOLDER GROUP TO OUR TO REVIEW THAT THE EXISTING OUR REGULATIONS AND AND. STATUTE AND DETERMINE WHETHER THERE SHOULD BE ANY ADDITIONAL OUR REQUIREMENTS ADDED TO ELEAZAR. REGARDING HEALTH AND SAFETY GIVEN THE THAT ALL OF THE TITLE TWENTY TWO STANDARDS WERE GOING TO GO AWAY. I'M AND THAT THE GROUP WAS REQUIRED TO LOOK AT THREE SPECIFIC AREAS. OUTDOOR SHEET STRUCTURES ACCESS TO AGE APPROPRIATE BATHROOM AND DRINKING WATER FACILITIES. AND PROPHECIES FOR PARENT NOTIFICATION AND RESOLUTION VIOLATIONS. AND SO WE WE DIDN'T I COMMUNICORP WITH A STAKEHOLDERS AND THERE WAS THE OTHER THE GROUP WITH STAKEHOLDERS OUT OF. THREE WHICH WERE NOT ONLY A PROVIDERS THREE WERE ELLIOTT PROVIDERS AND THAT WE HAD REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF BAD DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES. AYE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. AT AND LEGISLATIVE STAFF WHO ARE PART OF THIS GROUP I'M THE GROUP REVIEWED. THE STANDARDS IN YOUR AGENDA ON A. PITCH SEVEN HAS BEEN PICKING UP SOME OF THE THAT THE A RECOMMENDATION TO THE GROUP I WOULD PUT THEM INTO CATEGORIES ONE CATEGORY IS THIS. A SET OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO ADD ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS TO TITLE FIVE STANDARDS. I'M ABOUT CA NINETY FIFTH FIGURE ON THE TOP PAGE SEVEN THEIR NUMBERS OF THAT THE STANDARDS OF THE GROUP RECOMMENDED SO SO WITH SO THE FIRST FEW ARE ALL RELATED TO THE THINGS THAT WE THAT THE GROUP OF AFTER. TED. REVIEW NOT REQUIRING THAT OUTDOOR SHE'D. EXIST AND ISN'T SAFE IN GOOD REPAIR. FEDERAL KING WATER BE ACCESSIBLE AND READILY AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT THE DAY. BUT FACILITIES HAVE ONE TOILET AND WASHING FIXTURE FOR EVERY FIFTEEN CHILDREN. THAT RESTROOMS ARE ONLY BE AVAILABLE OFFER PRESCHOOLS AND KINDERGARTENERS PRESCHOOLERS INCOME EARNERS ABOUT FOR OLDER CHILDREN. I'M AND THEN THERE WERE A COUPLE OTHER THAT THE OTHERS OF THE GROUP THOUGHT WERE IMPORTANT ADDED ONE BEING THAT THE STAFF MUST MAINTAIN VISUAL SUPERVISION OF CHILDREN. AND THAT INDOOR AND OUTDOOR SPACE BE PROPERLY CONTAIN DEFENSE STAND AND PROVIDE ENOUGH SPACE FOR THE MEMBERS CHILDREN USING IT. I'M SO THOSE ARE ALL OF. A REQUIREMENT THAT THERE THE GROUP WOULD RECOMMEND AT BEING ADDED TO TITLE FIGHT REGULATIONS THEY ARE ALL EITHER VERT VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL OR VERY SIMILAR TO SOME OF THE EXISTING TITLE TWENTY TWO RULES I'M BY ONE OF THE. VERY SMALL SHARE OF THE EXISTING TACTILE TWENTY STANDARDS ARE PRETTY LARGE. BOB IS PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL O. HANDBOOK OF THOSE REQUIREMENTS VISIT THESE ARE A FEW THAT EITHER WERE REQUIRED BY THE. BY LET LEGISLATION TO BE REVIEWED BY THE GROUP OR THAT THE GROUP THAT WERE IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO AT. THE SECOND SET OF OF RECOMMENDATIONS IS REGARDING CHANGES IN STATUTE AND AT ALL OF THOSE WRECK RECOMMENDATIONS ARE RELATED TO THE UNIFORM COMPLETE PROCEDURES. I'M FOR THE THE WORKGROUP RECOMMENDED THAT I AM PROUD THAT THE UNIFORM COMPLETE PROCEDURES BE UTILIZED TO PROP TO OUR RESOLVE ANY COMPLAINTS. FROM PARENTS OR ANY OTHERS OUT REGARDING HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES IN STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS. DOT AND IT'S SPECIFICALLY THAT THE WORKGROUP RECOMMENDED THAT THE TIME LINES THAT ARE CURRENTLY USED FOR WILLIAMS RELATED COMPLAINTS. BE USED FOR STATE PRESCHOOL HEALTH AND SAFETY AND SO THAT MEANS THAT A THAT ANY COMPLAINT WOULD NEED TO BE RESOLVED WITHIN A THIRTY DAYS. BY A SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THAT THE COMPLAINT WILL BE NOTIFIED WITHIN FORTY FIVE DAYS. ON THE DAY OF THE WORK THAT THE WORKGROUP ALSO RECOMMENDED SOMETHING THAT'S NOT CURRENTLY IF YOU SEE PEOPLE BUT A BED THAT THEY RECOMMENDED IS THAT THE. THE DISTRICTS BE REQUIRED TO START INVESTIGATING THESE COMPLAINTS WITHIN TEN DAYS AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS A VERY SIMILAR TO AN EXISTING TITLE TWENTY TWO REQUIREMENTS WHERE IF SOMEONE DOES CALLED THE. HOTLINE AND COMPLAINTS THAT YOU FEEL THAT THERE'S SOME ISSUE GOING ON ENOUGH ENOUGH FACILITY. IF THE DOG GOES AND THAT THE FACT THAT WITH INTENT IF. SO THAT'S A QUICK SUMMARY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE GROUP I THINK WE THOUGHT THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE FOR REASONABLE WE PICK THE PAID TO ADD SOME. THAT EXPECTATIONS FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY THAT WEREN'T THERE BEFORE OUT WITHOUT ANY TITLE TWENTY TWO STANDARDS AT ALL BUT THEY DO STILL PROVIDE SCHOOL DISTRICTS A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY TO OPERATE THEIR PROGRAMS. TERAPLEX COMBINED PROGRAMS WITH FROM THE SMOKING GUN WAS JUST WAS PART OF THE INTENT OF THAT THE LEGISLATION. THANK YOU COME SO BEFORE WE GET ON TO PARTNER EDUCATION CAN YOU JUST WALK THROUGH FOR THE CAN MEAN THE PUBLIC HOW THE RECOMMENDATIONS. WORKSHOPS LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ACTION AND WHAT WE WOULD NEED TO HAPPEN FOR THESE TO. GOING TO FACTORED TO FALL BACK ON. THE STATUS QUO WHAT WE ADOPTED LAST YEAR IN THE BUDGET RECOVER DODD THE WAY THAT THE STATUE. LEAVE OUT THE EXEMPTIONS WILLIG WALK BIG VENTURE WILL TAKE EFFECT JULY FIRST NINETEEN ABSENT ANY OTHER ACTION. ITEM THAT RIGHT NOW WITH THESE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE TITLE FIVE REQUIREMENTS CAN BE DONE THROUGH REGULATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF ED BUT LOOK THE LEGISLATION SAYS THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS AUTHORITY TO. TO OUR DEVELOP EMERGENCY REGULATIONS ARM AT THE RESULT OF THIS VOTERS THAT SORT OF A A BUILT IN MECHANISM FOR SOME OF THOSE. TO TAKE EFFECT. THAT DATE THE RULE CHANGES TO THE UNIFORM COMPLETE PROCEDURES THAT REQUIRE STATUTES OF THAT WOULD NEED TO GO THROUGH EITHER. IN A BUDGET TRAILER LEGISLATION OR A SEPARATE BILL I'M BUT IT DOES REQUIRE I'M SOME KIND OF CHANGE IN STATUTES SO I THINK THAT THE WROTE THE TIMING OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WAS INTENDED TO BE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BUDGET PROCESS SO THAT. IF THERE WERE CONCERNS FROM THE LEGISLATURE THERE WITH INTERESTED MAKING STATUTORY CHANGES THAT THEY CAN BE HEARD. OUT THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS ARM BUT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT ANY CHANGES ARE ARE ANY LEGISLATION IS ADOPTED AT THE RESOLVE THE STAKEHOLDER GROUP. THE EXEMPTION WILL BEGIN TO TAKE EFFECT JULY FIRST TWENTY NINETEEN THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. HI SARAH NOVEL MORGAN AND. FOR REPRESENTING US STATE SUPERINTENDENT TOM PRODUCTS AND. SO WITH THAT APARTMENT IS IN AGREEMENT WITH NEEDING TO ADDRESS AND INCLUDE ALL OF THESE WE WOULD BEGIN IN SPRINGS ARE JUST AND RIGHT NOW. AS THE WRITING PACKETS FOR THE EMERGENCY RAGS BASED ON THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE REQUIRED TO PROMULGATE EMERGENCY RAGS ON OR BEFORE. JULY FIRST OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. IN THE EMERGENCY RAGS PROCESS THEY DO NOT ACCOMMODATE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD BUT WE FEEL THAT THERE IS ENOUGH STAKEHOLDER INTEREST ON A LOT OF PEOPLE WANTING TO SPEAK TO THIS ISSUE. THAT WE WOULD PLAN TO SOLICIT STAKEHOLDER INPUT PRIOR TO DEVELOPING THE REGULATIONS. THOSE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS WOULD BE DEVELOPED OVER THE SUMMER FORCE THE MIDDLE AND EARLY TWENTY NINETEEN. THEN OBVIOUSLY ONCE UPON THE RELEASE OF THOSE WE WOULD BEGIN THEN PRIME AYE GETTING PERMANENT REGULATIONS THROUGH THE NORMAL AWAY OUT PROCESS WHICH INCLUDES THAT PUBLIC COMMENT. BUT AS I STATED A MINUTE AGO WE WOULD FIRST HAVE STAKEHOLDER INPUT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF STAKEHOLDERS OUT THERE THAT WANT YOU. HAVE MORE TO SAY ON THAT. AND IN THE WINTER OF TWENTY NINETEEN THOSE REGULATIONS WOULD BE PROMULGATED AND IN THE SUMMER TWENTY NINETEEN THE REGULATIONS WHAT BEGAN. BUT AS I SAID WE'RE IN AGREEMENT WITH WHAT THE STATE COLOR WORKGROUP CAME UP WITH AND KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHER AREAS OF CONCERN THAT THEY WANTED TO ADDRESS AS WELL. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT FINANCE IN MINING BEYOND OFFENSE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AYE WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THIS TIME WE DO NOT HAVE ANY NEW PROPOSALS RELATED TO THIS ISSUE. ARE UNHAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. ANY RESPONSE TO THIS STAKEHOLDER SUGGESTION SO FAR. I. I I THINK OF THE SUGGESTIONS. YOU TOOK INTO ACCOUNT A LOT OF THE CONCERNS OF THE STAKEHOLDERS HOT AND I KNOW THEY'LL BE GOING PROCESS THAT WE'RE HAPPY ABOUT SOMETHING. OKAY. THANK YOU. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. NOT WE HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM GOOD MORNING DO NEED A STRONG GRIN SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CHILD CARE ALLIANCE OF LOS ANGELES. AND THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER. ON WE CONTINUE TO HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH AN AMP AND CONTINUE TO OPPOSE THE EXEMPTING OF ELEAZAR. FROM THE TITLE TWENTY TWO. REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. WE HEARD IN THE LAST. AGENDA ITEM ABOUT SOME OF THE SERIOUS ABOUT FACILITY CHALLENGES THAT FACE OUR LOCAL SCHOOLS. AND ONE OF OUR CONCERNS IS THAT. CLASSROOMS AND OTHER SPACE MIGHT BE USED INAPPROPRIATELY FOR THIS AGE GROUP. WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF SOME OF THE PRE OPERATION ALL HEALTH AND SAFETY REVIEWS. WE'RE CONCERNED THAT. THERE'S A LACK OF AWARENESS OF THE. REALLY DIFFERENT DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS OF THIS YOUNGER GROUP. AND WITH THE ELIMINATION OF UNANNOUNCED INSPECTIONS. TRANSPARENCY AND CONSUMER REVIEWS THAT CURRENTLY EXIST WITHIN THE LICENSE SIX SYSTEM. THAT IT WILL FURTHER CONFUSED PARENTS AND NOT PROVIDE THEM WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF STATUS OF THE PARTICULAR PROGRAMS. WE SUPPORT THE STAKEHOLDERS GROUP RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A COMPLAINT PROCEDURE. FOR ANONYMOUS COMPLAINTS AND PARTICULARLY FOR THE TIMELINE FOR THE RESOLUTION. AND WE URGE OF A ROBUST ONGOING CONVERSATION TODAY ABOUT TO FURTHER EXPLORE AND DISCUSS SOME OF THE CHALLENGES CONCERNS WE HAVE WITH REGARD TO THIS. THEY THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND AND I NEGLECTED TO MENTION IF YOU CAN TRY TO KEEP IT TO ONE MINUTE. THANK YOU. HELLO GOOD MORNING NEED A FAITH THE. CALIFORNIA CHILD DEVELOPMENT ADMINISTRATORS ASSOCIATION. MY ORGANIZATION ALSO HAS SOME VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS HERE THREE YEAR OLDS WHO MAY NOT BE POTTERY TRAINED IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE WE BELIEVE THAT ARE THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLD SHOULD BE IN THE SAFEST CONDITIONS THAT WE POSSIBLY CAN PUT THEM AND. SO THAT TITLE TWENTY TWO AS WAS NOTED EARLIER IS A VERY VERY VERY BIG ALONG REGULATION SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE STAKEHOLDER GROUP ARE FABULOUS WE DEFINITELY SUPPORT THOSE HOWEVER THIS IS ONLY AT THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG THERE ARE MANY OTHER HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATIONS IN HERE. AND WE REALLY FEEL THAT I'M OUR YOUNGEST CHILDREN NEED TO BE IN THE SAFEST PLACE POSSIBLE REGARDLESS OF THE SETTING ON WHETHER PRESCHOOL AS THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING PATTY PRUNE YOUR BIRTH FROM THE CHILD CARE LAW CENTER. I'M I I WANT TO FOCUS ON THE A CONSUMER AND PARENT. TRANSPARENCY ISSUES THAT ARE RAISED I THINK OF THE STAKEHOLDER COMMITTEE DID A GOOD JOB OF ADDRESSING SOME OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY BUT THIS IS AN AREA THAT WE HAVE PARTICULAR CONCERNS ABOUT. CURRENTLY WE HAVE A VERY GOOD PROTECTIVE STRUCTURE WHERE THERE CAN BE AN ANONYMOUS COMPLAINT IT'S INVESTIGATED WITHIN TEN DAYS BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY ALL THAT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE COMPLAINT AS WELL AS. THE LICENSING INSPECTION IS UP ON A PUBLIC WEBSITE SO APPARENT LOOKING FOR A CHILD CARE. SPOT AT A PRESCHOOL CAN KNOW WHAT KINDS OF VIOLATIONS HAVE OCCURRED AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY'VE BEEN RESOLVED WE ARE LOSING THAT TRANSPARENCY THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND. I'M. CONCERNED THAT. pPRESENT THEIR ON THEIR VIEWS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT. CONSUMER WEBSITE AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT. THAT'S THE DIRECTION THAT ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS ARE MOVING AND SEE ARMED ARE FEDERAL CCD BEING SHE IS TALKING MORE ABOUT. THE PUBLIC AWARENESS OF. SAFETY. RECORDS OF THESE. PLACES WHERE REPLACING OUR YOUNGEST CHILDREN AND I WOULD ASK YOU TO CONSIDER THAT ASPECT. YOU. MONEY FROM US ON BEHALF OF FIRST FIVE LA US WE'D LIKE TO AND EXPRESS SOME OF OUR CONCERNS AT THE LA A WORK GROUPS. RECOMMENDATIONS DID NOT GO FAR ENOUGH TO BALANCE HEALTH AND SAFETY AS WELL AS DEVELOPMENTAL APPROPRIATENESS. WE ARE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED THAT ANY OF THESE FLEXIBILITY USE. SHOULD BE LIMITED TO FOUR YEAR OLDS THREE YEAR OLDS ARE IN A VERY DIFFERENT LEVEL DEVELOPMENTALLY AND THESE ARE CHILDREN WHO AT TIMES ARE NOT POTTY TRAINED AND WE THINK THAT THOSE FLEXIBILITY IS JUST NEED TO BE KEPT A FOUR YEAR OLDS. IN ADDITION AND WE THINK THAT ANY OF THE WORKGROUP RECOMMENDATIONS THAT PROCEED PARTICULARLY MOVING REQUIREMENTS OVER THE TITLE FIVE BEFORE THAT HAPPENS THEIR NEEDS TO BE A CONCRETE PLAN. WE WOULD RECOMMEND THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES WOULD PARDON OF EDUCATION HAS GIVEN ACCESS. TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES CONSUMER COMPLAINT DATABASE SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO UPDATE THOSE COMPLAINTS. SO THAT PARENTS HAVE ACCESS TO SEE WHAT'S OCCURRING WHETHER IT WHAT'S OCCURRING WITHIN THE LEN COMPLAINTS IN ADDITION WE THINK ONE OTHER IMPORTANT. BROOKE ONE OTHER IMPORTANT PROTECT SAFETIES PROTECTION IS. COVERING EXPOSED ELECTRICAL OUTLETS THERE WERE A LOT OF STORIES ABOUT CHILDREN WHO WERE STICKING THINGS INTO OUTLETS AND SHOCKING THEMSELVES DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE THINK THIS IS AN INEXPENSIVE FIX THAT CAN EASILY BE ADDRESSED. AND THEN FINALLY WE AGREED THAT THE ONLY. RECOMMENDATION WAS NOT AN EXHAUSTIVE REVIEW OF TITLE TWENTY TWO. REQUIREMENTS AND AND WOULD REQUEST THAT AN EXHAUSTIVE REVIEW TAKES PLACE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING ALEX TO CAPRI ON BEHALF OF FIRST FIVE CALIFORNIA AND I MYSELF AT FIRST BY VALLEY'S COMMENTS THINKING. LOW THE CORNISH CALIFORNIA CHILDCARE RESOURCE AND REFERRAL NETWORK AYE IT WOULD LIKE TO MIRROR THE STATEMENTS AND MOST OF MY COLLEAGUES AND WE DO SUPPORT SOME OF THE STAKEHOLDER RECOMMENDATIONS BUT I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU A PERSONAL STORY. LAST WEEK I HAD TO MAKE A COMPLAINT AGAINST A FACILITY THAT MY GRANDDAUGHTER WAS SOON. AND THERE WAS CONSTANT COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE MYSELF THE PARENT AND COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING THESE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS ARE GOING TO BE LOST WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE MAINTAINED. IT'S IT'S. JUST SO IMPORTANT FOR THE FAMILY TO FEEL LIKE THEIR CHILD IS IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CANDOR HARRIS WITH CHILD ACTION ARE ECHOING THE COMMENTS OF PREVIOUSLY SAID WE HAVE SINCE SEVERE CONCERNS. ARE WE DO THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE EXHAUSTIVE RESEARCH DONE ON THIS. AND YOU KNOW HOLDING CHILDREN. IN THE MOST UTMOST CARE IS CRITICAL TO THEIR SAFETY AND DEVELOPMENT SIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING JENNIFER CRAPPIE WITH PARENT VOICES CALIFORNIA AND ARE FIFTEEN CHAPTERS ACROSS THE STATE. WOULD LIKE TO PARTICIPATE. IN THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO CONTINUE TO BRING THE VOICE OF PARENTS TO THIS ISSUE. ASIDE THE ISSUE OF SAFETY FOR OUR CHILDREN IN CHILD CARE. IS CRITICAL AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO FIND OUT ABOUT LICENSING VIOLATIONS TO BE ABLE TO. A REPORT VIOLATIONS WHEN THAT HAPPENS AND TO DO THAT. THROUGH AND THE EASE OF LICENSING AND THEIR EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER IS REALLY IMPORTANT. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S NOT LOST IN THIS NEW PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE MORNING THANK YOU THIS IS VALERIE TO NARROW IT CALIFORNIANS FOR QUALITY EARLY LEARNING AND I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO. THE SENTIMENTS OF THOSE BEFORE ME WE AGREED WITHTHE STAKEHOLDERS HAVE COME UP TO EXPRESS OUR CONCERN ABOUT. SUPERVISION HEALTH AND SAFETY THEIR OVER FORTY NINE THOUSAND LICENSED CHILDCARE PROVIDERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE WORK VERY HARD ALONG THE SIDE OF. COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING TO ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE OPERATING CHILDCARE SERVICES HAVE WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT IT MEANS TO PROTECT A CHILD HEALTH AND SAFETY. THE WEBSITES BEEN UPDATED THERE'S BEEN SOME GREAT INTERACTIVE VIDEOS AND TRAININGS OF HAPPENED THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF CHILDREN. AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE MORE AND MORE CHILDREN OVER TO THE K. TWELVE. AND PUBLIC SAID SECTOR WE ARE TAKING AWAY THOSE CONSUMER AND SAFETY POINTS THAT WE'VE PUT SO MUCH EFFORT INTO. SO I URGE YOU TO TAKE THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE STAKEHOLDER GROUPS AND KNOW THAT. ALTHOUGH CHRONOLOGICALLY YOU MAY BE AT AGE FOUR YEAR OLD DEVELOPMENT ONLY YOU COULD BE AT AGE TWO YEAR OLD ON THE CONTINUUM. THAT EARLY CHILD EDUCATION IS BIRTH YOU TWELFTH AT TWELVE YEARS OF AGE AND WERE NOT ALWAYS WHERE WE ARE DEVELOPMENTALLY ON THE CONTINUUM SO PLEASE. AND TAKE THOSE CONSIDERATIONS INTO PLACE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THE JUDGE JEFF BACA REPRESENTING THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. JUST WANTED TO. QUICK COMMENT THAT OBVIOUSLY THE HEALTH AND CARE OF THE CHILDREN THAT ARE. BEING SERVED IN THE LA SETTING IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE TO. I RIVERSIDE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND. MY LA COLLEAGUES AND REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT. THERE ARE TITLE FIVE YEARS REGULATIONS THAT ADDRESS HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES AT ELEAZAR. OF WE BELIEVE WE ARE TESTIFIED LAST YEAR AND CONTINUE TO BELIEVE TODAY THAT MANY OF THOSE TITLE FIVE REGULATIONS ACTUALLY PROVIDE FAR MORE ROBUST. PROTECTIONS OF THE CHILDREN. AND THEN LASTLY ALSO TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT. THE ORIGINAL GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL A COMPONENT OF THAT WAS ABOUT PROVIDING THE FLEXIBILITY TO STREAMLINE THE PROGRAM SO THAT WE COULD PROVIDE GREATER ACCESS. TO LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND CHILDREN THAT DID NOT PREVIOUSLY HAVE ACCESS TO THESE PROGRAMS. CLEARLY WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE THAT WE CAN TO ENSURE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THOSE CHILDREN. I WE BELIEVE THAT THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS IS A CHIEF TACKLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AMANDA DICKEY WITH THE CALIFORNIA COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS ASSOCIATION I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE. I WANT TO ADDRESS TWO QUICK POINTS ECHOING THE ACCESS ISSUE WE REALLY DO FEEL LIKE THIS WILL LEAD TO GREATER ACCESS BECAUSE OF THE STREAMLINING THAT IT WILL ALLOW FOR ELEAZAR WHO. WE KNOW HOLD THE VAST MAJORITY OF CONTRACTS WHEN IT COMES TO SEE PRESCHOOL. AND I THINK WE APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS ABOUT THE CONSUMER PROTECTION ISSUES FOR SURE BUT WE ALSO. AGREED WITH AND DID RECOMMEND TO THE ALLEY A WORKER AT THE ALLEY ó WORK GROUP. THAT THEY ADOPT THESE ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS THAT THEY INCLUDED IN THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH WOULD EXPEDITE THE PROCESS FOR ADDRESSING PARENT COMPLAINTS AND MAKE SURE THAT THE PROCESS BEGINS WITHIN TEN DAYS AND ALLOW PARENTS TO FOLLOW ANONYMOUSLY. THANK YOU THANK YOU. HI LAURA MADNESS STARTED FORESEE CINEMA. I WANNA ECHO THE CONCERNS THAT THE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION ADVOCATES HAVE. MENTIONED HERE. ALSO THAT. WE NEED MORE INSPECTIONS FOR ESPECIALLY THOSE YOUNG THREE YEAR OLDS NOT LESS AND WE ARE BUCKING THE NATIONAL TREND FOR ANNUAL INSPECTIONS. ALSO NOT ONLY OUR THREE YEAR OLDS NOT NECESSARILY POTTY TRAINED BUT THEY ARE NOT VERBAL NECESSARILY SO THEY CANNOT VERBALIZE HAVE THEIR ISSUES AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT. PARENTS HAVE ACCESS TO ANY. HISTORY OF COMPLAINTS. OF A. A FACILITY WHERE THEIR YOUNG CHILDREN ARE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS LAURIE FURSTENFELD AND I AM A SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY AT THE CHILDCARE LAW CENTER WE ECHOED THAT SAME CONCERNS OF MANY OF. ON THE OTHER E. C. E. ADVOCATES REGARDING HEALTH AND SAFETY ARE LATE TO FOCUS ON THEIR CURRENT UNIFORM COMPLAINT SYSTEM. IF THAT OUR PROCEDURE IF THIS IS WHAT PARENTS ARE LEFT TO MOVING FORWARD WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND IMPROVING IT. PERSONALLY REPRESENTING TWO PARENTS IN THE PAST YEAR AND HELPING THEM WRITING UNIFORM COMPLETE IT'S A VERY OPAQUE. DIFFICULT PROCESS TO GO THROUGH PARENTS REALLY HAVE LITTLE GUIDANCE AT BOTH LEVELS BOTH MAKING COMPLAINTS TO THE SCHOOL AND THEN TO. CD  <u><c.green>ON SO I</c></u> WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND ON IMPROVING THAT PROCESS IN MAKING IT LESS BURDENSOME FOR PARENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN MEMBERS.

A MINUTE DEFERRED AS THERE ARE NONE THAT WHEN. STILL AT WE ACTUALLY AND FOR THE PRE SCHOOLS THAT ARE CALVINISTIC PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION MONITORS THROWS THROUGH OUR TITLE FIVE STANDARDS.

PROPOSALS THAT WE HAVE. CURRENTLY IN THE GOVERNOR. TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET. THANK YOU. BERMAN FINANCE. GOOD MORNING BRIANNA FRIENDS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES OVER FOUR POINT THREE BILLION FOR CALIFORNIA'S EARLY LEARNING IN CHILDCARE PROGRAMS. THIS REPRESENTS AN EIGHT PERCENT INCREASE OVER THE TOTAL TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN BUDGET ACT ALLOCATION. THESE AUGMENTATIONS ARE LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO FULL YOUR IMPLEMENTATION OF ITEMS INCLUDED IN THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN BUDGET ACTS. INCLUDING INCREASES TO PROVIDE EVERY EMBRACE IT RATES FALL THEY STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS AS WELL AS INCREASES IN HOW IT STAGE TWO AND THREE COST OF CARE. IN ADDITION THIS BUDGET INCLUDES THE FINAL AUGMENTATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN MULTI YEAR AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND LOOK AT THE LEGISLATURE. THESE AUGMENTATIONS INCLUDED TWO POINT EIGHT PERCENT STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT RATE INCREASE. I A PERMANENT EXTENSION OF THE REGIONAL MARKET WE EMBRACE AND RATE HOLD HARMLESS INCLUDED IN THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN BUDGET ACT. AND THE FINAL ROUND OF APPROXIMATELY THREE THOUSAND FULL DAY STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES ONE TIME INVESTMENT OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE BILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND AND FORTY TWO POINT TWO MILLION FEDERAL TANITH FOR THE INCLUSIVE EARLY EDUCATION EXPANSION PROGRAM. THE INTENT OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO EXPAND ACCESS TO INCLUSIVE EARLY EDUCATION IN SETTINGS APPROPRIATE FOR ALL CHILDREN AGED ZERO TO FIVE. THIS PROGRAM WILL BE A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM WITH PRIORITY GIVEN TO THOSE WITH A DEMONSTRATED NEED FOR EXPANDED ACCESS. AS WELL AS APPLICANTS TO REPRESENT A CONSORTIUM OF LOCAL PARTNERS. THESE GRANT FUNDS MUST BE USED FOR ONE TIME INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS SUCH AS COST OF EQUIPMENT FACILITIES RENOVATIONS THAT AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. AND WILL BE AVAILABLE OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD. THIS PROGRAM WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BE OF THE SPECIAL EDUCATION DIVISION AND THE EARLY EDUCATION AND SUPPORT DIVISION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. THANK YOU. NEXT. GOOD MORNING SIR COURT HAS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THREE OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL SAW LIMIT MY COMMENTS TO THESE PROPOSALS THE FIRST IS THE. THE FIRST IS TO INCREASE STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS THE SECOND WOULD BE TO CREATE INCLUSIVE EARLY EDUCATION EXPANSION GRANT IN THIRD IS TO EXTEND THE ARMOR HOLD HARMLESS. WITH REGARD TO THE FIRST PROPOSAL TO ADD STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS ON TO ELEAZAR ARKANSAS WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT LIMITING SLOTS TO I LIAISE PRIMARILY BECAUSE RECENT SLOTS ON. RECENT THOUGHTS RELEGATES ARE NOT BEEN FULLY UTILIZE CD HAS HAD TO RUN MULTIPLE ROUNDS OF APPLICATIONS TO FILL THE SLOTS AND OUTSIDE TO USE ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY TO ALLOCATE SLOTS THAT WERE INTENDED TO BE FULL THEY SLOTS FOR ELEAZAR. INTO PART THE SLOTS FOR BOTH ELEAZAR NOT ONLY AIDS. IN RECENT LAW INCREASES HAVE BEEN EARMARKED TO PROPOSITION NIGHT OF PROPER. HAD BEEN EARMARKED TO ELOISE PRIMARY PRIMARILY WITH THE INTENTION TO USE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING. STATE PRESCHOOL USE OF THE MIX OF FUNDING SOURCES THAT'S REDUCE THE STATE'S FLEXIBILITY TO AYE FULL DAY SLOTS TO BOTH NON ELEAZAR ELEAZAR. WERE LA FULL DAY FLOCK THERE FUNDED ENTIRELY PRINT FROM PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT OR NINE ELLIOTT FULL DAY SLOTS ARE FUNDED WITH THE MAKES A PROPOSITION NINETY AND NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. AND WE RECOMMEND. WE RECOMMEND FUNDING ALL STATE PRESCHOOL PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT AND THIS WOULD RESULT IN SHIFTING A PORTION A FULL DAY STATE PRESCHOOL THAT'S FUNDED WITH PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT INCH. WITH NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT INTO PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT WHICH WOULD GIVE FLEXIBILITY TO THE STATE OF DISTRIBUTE THOUGHTS TO ANY INTERESTED PROVIDER. A THEN MOVING FORWARD IF THE LEGISLATURE'S INTERESTED IN SUPPORTING MORE FULL DAY STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS TO MAKE AVAILABLE TO BOTH NON LEN ALLEY PROVIDERS. WITH REGARD TO THE SECOND PROPOSAL TO. TO CREATE INCLUSIVE EARLY EDUCATION EXPANSION CARD EXPANSION RAT. WE BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S INTEREST IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES IS LAUDABLE BUT WE RECOMMEND REJECTING A PROPOSAL AND AS A SIDE NOTE THIS. PROGRAM USES BOTH PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT AND. ANTENNA FUNDING. JUSTIN NO FEDERAL REGULATION GENERALLY PROHIBIT THE USE OF TEN OF FUNDS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE IT APPEARS UNLIKELY THAT CAN'T IF ONE COULD BE USED FOR THE FACILITY. RENOVATION PROPOSED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. BUT PRIMARILY ARE CONCERNED IS IN REGARDS THAT CD  <u><c.green>RUNS</c></u> PROGRAMS TO FUND THE PROPOSED PURPOSES SUCH AS THE PURPOSE IS TO FIRST SUPPORT FACILITY NEEDS A PER AND TO SUPPORT QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS. AS AN ALTERNATIVE THE LEGISLATURE COULD MODIFY INCREASE. INCREASE FUNDING TO THE EXISTING PROGRAMS TO FURTHER SUPPORT PROVIDERS. FOR EXAMPLE THE CHILD CARE FACILITIES REVOLVING PHONE APPROACH WHERE PROVIDERS COULD APPLY FOR INTEREST FREE LOANS AND PURCHASE RENOVATED FACILITIES. I'M WITHIN THIS PROGRAM PROVIDERS ARE RESTRICTED TO PURCHASING PORTABLE FACILITIES AND PROVIDERS ARE NOT USING THIS PROGRAM. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN NO PROVIDERS APPLY FOR THESE FUNDS. WHICH HURT MUCH CURRENTLY HOLD OVER TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. AND AS AN ALTERNATIVE FOR THIS PROGRAM THE LEGISLATURE COULD MAKE A PORTION OF THIS PROGRAM ON THE GRANT THEY COULD THEY COULD OUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO THIS PROGRAM THEY COULD EXTEND THE PAYMENT RIPARIAN. BROUGHT IN THE ALLOWABLE USES SO THAT THIS FUND COULD ADDRESS THE EXISTING FACILITY MEANS. A THAT IN TERMS OF THE TECH TRAINING PURPOSES WE THINK ONE TIME FUNDING TOWARDS THIS IS UNLIKELY TO IMPROVE QUALITY PROVE MEANT A QUALITY IMPROVEMENT IN THIS AREA. ON CD  <u><c.green>RUNS ABOUT THIRTY</c></u> QUALITY PROOF IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS AND IF THE LEGISLATURE WAS INTERESTED IN IT THEY'RE DETERMINED THAT EXISTING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT WASN'T. INSUFFICIENT IT COULD REALLOCATE EXISTING QUALITY IMPROVEMENT FUNDING TO PRIORITIZE SPECIAL RELATED. ON SPECIAL EDUCATION RELATED TRAINING OR PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ONGOING FUNDING FOR THIS PURPOSE. AND WITH REGARD TO THE THIRD PROPOSAL WHICH IS THE ARMOR HOLD HARMLESS PROPOSAL WE RECOMMEND THAT. THE LEGISLATURE ALLOW EXISTING HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION CAN SPOT EXPIRE AT THE END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS AN WITH CURRENT LAW. WHEN THE STATE IS INCREASE RATES IN RECENT YEARS THEY ARE ACCOMPANIED BY TEMPORARY HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION SO THAT NO PROVIDER RECEIVED. LESS THAN IT RECEIVES PRIOR TO THE RATE INCREASE TODAY THIS RESULTS IN FUNDING DERIVED AND SLOT FUNDING BEING DERIVED AND ONE OF FOR SURVEYS. WE ESTIMATE THAT SIXTY THREE PERCENT OF SLOTS ARE FUNDED USING THE MOST RECENT SURVEY. TO DETERMINE THEIR RAY WHERE THE REMAINING UNTIL JUNE TO THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION THE REMAINING THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT OF SLOTS ARE FUNDED WITH RATES DERIVE FROM PRIOR YOUR SURVEYS. THIS SPECIFIC HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION DOES TWO THINGS TO THE CHILD CARE MARKET THE FIRST IT ALLOWS SOME FAMILIES ACCESS THE LARGER SHARE THE MARKET OF THE CHILD CARE MARKET THAN OTHERS. AND THE SECOND REMEMBER IT THIS REIMBURSES SOME CHILD CARE PROVIDERS WITHOUT RATES HIGHER THAN THE SEVENTY FIFTH PERCENTILE OF THE REGIONAL MARKET. IN BY SAID EXTENDING THE POLES CRIMES PROVISION THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL EXTEND THE INEQUITIES IN ACCESS. IN ACCESS AND REIMBURSEMENT RATES ACROSS THE STATE. SO RATHER BY EXTENDING THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER USING THE PROPOSED AUGMENTATION WHICH IS FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL FIFTEEN HUNDRED. ALTERNATE PLYMOUTH ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT SLOTS USING THE MOST RECENT COST ESTIMATES. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION BUT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. BERMAN OF EDUCATION I'D FAIR ENOUGH MARK AND I MET SO WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND I'M GONNA START WITH THAT PRE SCHOOL EXPANSION AND THEN GO ON TO THE EARLY I'D. I THINK INCLUSIVE GRANT PROGRAM SEVEN TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THE ADMINISTRATION THE LEGISLATURE MADE A MULTI YEAR AGREEMENT CUT THE PRESCHOOL PROMISED TO FIND A HUNDRED MILLION OVER THREE YEARS TO EXPAND QUALITY FISCAL. FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES USING PROP NINETY EIGHT. AND NINE ALLEYWAYS HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO OPERATE EITHER FULL DAY OR PER DAY CS PP CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM USING THOSE FUNDS WHILE NINE ELEAZAR. ONLY RECEIVE THE PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING FOR THE PART DAIS YES PP. SO WE HAVE HAD WHAT I'M OVER FINISHING UP OUR SECOND ROUND OF THAT IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THE RFA WAS RESTRICTED TO ELEAZAR. AND WE DID HAVE TO RELEASE IT THREE TIMES THIS GOES TO THE LA OWES RECOMMENDATION TO ALLOW NON ELEAZAR TO OPERATE STATE PRESCHOOL WITH. THAT AND PROP NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS SO THREE YOU RELEASES OF OUR FACE IN ORDER TO EXPAND ALL OF THOSE FUNDS. THIS LAST TIME THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET WE HAVE WE WERE I AM ABLE TO DO BOTH NON. ELEAZAR AND ELEAZAR AND PRIORITY FOR FULL DAY AND PER DAY. WE ARE ABOUT TO RELEASE OUR INFORMATION ON THAT THE APPLICATION HAD BEEN EXTENDED DUE TO THE FIRES AND MUD SLIDES SO WE DID HAVE A DELAY AS WE LIVE. APPLICANTS COMMAND WE DO NOT THINK THAT WILL EXPAND ALL THE DOLLARS AND SO THERE WILL BE SOME STILL THERE THAT WILL LOOK AT PUTTING BACK OUT AGAIN. AT BUT WE HAVE HEARD AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT THE NONO LIAISED WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO OFFER MORE AT THIS YES PP. SLOTS. SAID THEN I'M GONNA MOVE ON TO THE INCLUSIVE EARLY ADD EXPANSION PROPOSAL AND WE WOULD SAY THAT THIS PROPOSAL RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN ENTERING THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. TO BE IN THE MOST INCLUSIVE AND SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENTS POSSIBLE WHICH IS NOT ONLY CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT EARLY CHILDHOOD RESEARCH IT IS ALSO THE FOUNDATION ON WHICH THE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT. IDA AS BELT EDUCATING CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES AND EARLY CHILDHOOD ENVIRONMENTS WITH SAME AGE PEERS WITHOUT DISABILITIES IS DESCRIBED IN THE A. D. A.. AS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT AND HAVE A LIFELONG IMPACT ON CHILDREN'S FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES IMPROVED EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES. ACCESS FOR PARTICIPATION AND ALL ASPECTS OF SCHOOL LIFE AS WELL AS MEANINGFUL COMMUNITY AND CAREER LIFE THE RESEARCH ALSO SHOWS THAT CHILDREN WHO DON'T HAVE THE DISABILITY SO THERE IS. NORMALS ELITE DEVELOPING PEERS ALSO BENEFIT FROM THE FULL INCLUSION PROGRAMS. WE SEE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE ACCESS TO THAT FOR ALL CHILDREN. AS WELL AS LOOKING AT A WAY TO INCENTIVIZE PROGRAMS THAT DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN IN SPECIAL DAY CLASSROOMS THERE'S SO THAT THEY WOULD INSTEAD BECOME FULL INCLUSION MODELS AND BE IN THE SAME. PROGRAMS WITH OTHER PEERS. SELF SUPPORT FOR THAT ONE. AND THEN AND. WE ALSO SUPPORT THE ARMOR HOLD HER LAST. WE FELT THAT OUR PROGRAMS WITH THAT SUBSIDIES RATES AND ALL OF THOSE PIECES WOULD CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM HAVING NOT AS THEIR REIMBURSEMENT. DEBORAH BROWN OF THE HAVE A STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT THE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS SINCE THAT IS JUST PART OF THIS ITEM. HAVING ON BEHALF OF AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS THAT THE SUPERINTENDENT WAS APPRECIATIVE OF THAT ADDITIONAL FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS PROVIDED IN THE BUDGET TO. INCREASE THE. HOURLY ARE THAT THAT DAILY RATE FOR THE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND AND ANYTHING CAN HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS IN THE NEXT ITEM BUT THERE CONTINUES TO BE A NEED TO HAVE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. TO INCREASE THEIR RATES NOT ONLY AS THE MINIMUM WAGE IS GOING UP BUT IS ALSO THE ACOSTA AT THE COST OF LIVING IS GOING UP BUT IT HASN'T BEEN ADJUSTED BEYOND THE FIFTY MILLION SO. YOU KNOW YOU HEAR HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT IN THE NEXT ITEM BUT WE'D LIKE TO KNOW OUR SUPPORT FOR INCREASED FUNDING FOR AFTER SCHOOL. THANK YOU QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SEEING NONE I DO HAVE A FEW COMMENTS ON ON THESE ITEMS FIRST WHILE ALREADY AFTER SCHOOL. PROGRAMS I'D A BIG BELIEVER IN SUPPORT OF OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. THEY HAVE TREMENDOUS JOB BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FROM COMMUNICATIVE SLOT FORCED MEANT EDUCATION GROUPS AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE MONEY IN THE BUDGET WERE WERE TIED ON THE GENERAL FUND. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE DOWN BY MITCH THIS LAST YEAR FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IT PROP SIXTY FOUR. THE MARIJUANA MEASURE HE CAN'T QUITE SEE THIS BUT HERE'S A CAMPAIGN COMMERCIAL FROM PROP SIXTY FOUR AND IT SAYS. PROP SIXTY FOUR FUNDS AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS THAT WAS THAT WAS THE REALLY THE ONLY PROMISED TO THE VOTERS WHO SAY ONE ATTACKS AND REGULATE MARIJUANA. AND THE REVENUE YET THAT THAT THE THE HEADLINE WAS FUND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS SO. JUST WANT TO ASK. WHAT IS OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THINKING ABOUT WHEN? SIXTY FOUR REVENUES WILL COME FORWARD AND HOW WE WILL HOW WILL WE. MEMORIALIZE THIS PROMISE TO THE ELECTORATE. CHAU ACTED AFRAID AT MY MY COLLEAGUES AT FINANCE ARE ACTUALLY WORKING ON ON THAT ON THAT ASSIGNMENT. SIDE I'D HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOUR. OKAY BUT JUST THAT POINT BUT NOTED THAT SOUND WHEN IT DOES. NOT COME BACK THAT THE REVENUE PLAN WE. EXPECTS THAT THAT WE WILL TAKE IT INTO CONSIDERATION THE PROMISE TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. OKAY AND THEN ALSO FOR THE EARLY EDUCATION COMPONENT THAT WE'RE GONNA HEAR. IN GREAT DETAIL NEXT BUT BUT I WOULD NOTE THAT. THAT THERE ARE NEW.

THE STATE REQUIRES US TO SERVE A HEALTHY MEALS WE FOLLOW THE CHILD INTO A CURFEW PROGRAM. THE MALE PATTERN HAS CHANGED THIS YEAR IN OCTOBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE HAVE SINCE THEN WE'VE BEEN REQUIRED TO SERVE EVEN HEALTHIER INGREDIENTS TO OUR CHILDREN. BUT THE COST FOR THE YET A REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND NOT KEEP PACE WITH THAT. ON AND THAT IS WHY WE NEED THE TWENTY THREE CENTS PER MEAL TO BE REINSTATED THINKING. GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS KEN HACKED NAM THE POLICY DIRECTOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S NUTRITION POLICY INSTITUTE. NPR ENGAGES IN RESEARCH TO STRENGTHEN POLICY. OUR FOCUS IS ON THE FEDERAL FOOD PROGRAMS LIKE THE CHILD ADULT CARE FOOD PROGRAM. WHICH SERVE YOUNGER CHILDREN. STATE NATIONAL SURVEYS SHOW THAT MOST AMERICANS CONSUME FAR FEWER FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. FOR THAT I JERRY GUIDELINES SAY THE SHOULD. THIS IS PARTICULARLY HARMFUL AT THE YOUNG AGES WHEN CHILDREN ARE GROWING RAPIDLY WHEN THEIR BRAINS ARE DEVELOPING. AND WHEN THEY'RE FORMING TASTE PREFERENCES AND DIETARY HABITS THAT WILL LAST A LIFETIME. UNFORTUNATELY FRUIT AND VEGETABLES ARE RELATIVELY EXPENSIVE FOODS. FOR THE NEARLY ONE QUARTER OF CALIFORNIA'S YOUNG CHILDREN WHO LIVE IN POVERTY. THESE ARE LIKELY TO BE MISSING FROM THE FAMILY DIET. THE FEDERAL CHILD ADULT CARE FOOD PROGRAM HELPS MAKE UP THIS DEFICIENCY. BUT PARTICULARLY IN A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA THE FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT DOES NOT GO FAR ENOUGH. WITH A TWENTY THREE CENTS PER MEAL BEING REQUESTED IN THIS ITEM. A CHILD CARE CENTER COULD SERVE. CARROTS. APPLE'S. ORANGES ALL. GROWN IN CALIFORNIA SO THE FARMERS WILL BE HAPPY.

YOU KNOW BETTER OUTCOMES BECAUSE OF THAT AND. WE ALSO WE MEET THE STANDARDS THAT WE GET SOME FUNDING FROM THE AND FROM THE CHILD AND ADULT CARE FOOD PROGRAM AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. AND AT BUT EVEN WITH THAT WE STRUGGLE TO MAKE IT WORK BECAUSE I KIDDING OPERATES IN THE BAY AREA WHICH IS A HIGH COST REGION. WE ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE OUR OWN KITCHEN. THAT'S ONE OF THE WAYS WE MAKE IT WORK BUT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER WE'RE ONLY REIMBURSED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL A DOLLAR SEVENTY FIVE FOR BREAKFAST THREE TWENTY THREE FOR LUNCH. AND SO. YOU KNOW. TO MAKE ALL THAT WORK THAT GOES INTO FOOD PREPARATION. IT IT ALSO GOES INTO THEIR FACILITIES COSTS TRAVEL COSTS RELATED TO GETTING THE FOOD AROUND OF THE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN AND GETTING THE FOOD THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND SO ON YOU KNOW WE STRUGGLE TO MAKE IT WORK AND AND WE WE KNOW THAT WE COULD I DO MORE. AND. AND DO RIGHT IN BE MAKING A BETTER INVESTMENT IN OUR CHILDREN BY PROVIDING THIS AT FUNDING TO OUR.

SINCE THAT CALIFORNIA ELIMINATED THE SUPPLEMENTAL REIMBURSEMENTS WE SAW A SIGNIFICANT DROP OFF A PARTICIPATION IN THAT PROGRAM AND IN MANY CASES THAT MEANS THAT PROVIDERS CHILDCARE PROVIDERS NO LONGER PROVIDE FOOD IN THEIR PROGRAMS. BECAUSE THEY THEMSELVES ARE FOOD INSECURE SO WE STRONGLY SUPPORT FULL BELLIES. AND FINALLY WE SUPPORT THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION'S ASK FOR HEALTHY AND CHILDCARE SETTINGS MANY OF OUR MEMBERS ARE IN OURS PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT TO FAMILY CHILDCARE PROVIDERS TO. AND FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO SAN DIEGO TO PROVIDE HEALTHY ENVIRONMENTS IN THEIR THEIR CHILD CARE HOMES. ON BUT THEY DO THIS WITHOUT ANY SORT OF STATE FUNDING PROVIDER BY PROVIDING GRANTS TO PROVIDERS MANY OF WHOM ARE THEMSELVES AT HIGH RISK FOR CHRONIC DISEASES THAT COULD BE REDUCED THROUGH BETTER EATING OR MORE MOVEMENTS. WE SEE THAT THIS PROGRAM IS HAS A TRIFLE BENEFIT NOT ONLY TO CHILDREN BUT THE PROVIDERS OF THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND THEN FINALLY ON THAT STAFF COMMENT AROUND A. B. AP ADMINISTRATIVE RATES MOST OF OUR MEMBERS ARE ALSO AP CONTRACT HOLDERS AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SHARE. WITH YOU THAT THEY HAD LOTS OF QUESTIONS THANK YOU AGAIN. PAT A PRE NUMBER FROM THE CHILD CARE LAW CENTER. ALSO IN VERY STRONG SUPPORT OF THE E. C. E. ASK FOR. A BILLION DOLLARS THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE VOUCHERS THAT SERVE A PRIMARILY INFANTS AND TODDLERS. WE ALSO KNOW THAT. WE HAVE THIRTY THREE THOUSAND ARE SLIGHTLY LESS OF THESE VOUCHERS STATEWIDE RIGHT NOW AND. AS BOMB WAS PREVIOUSLY TESTIFIED THERE ARE FORTY SIX THOUSAND CHILDREN ON THE WAITING LIST IN LA ALONE FOR THESE VOUCHERS. I IT'S NOT NEAR ENOUGH TO MEET THE STATEWIDE NEED AND IT IS HOLDING US BACK WE REALLY SEE THIS AS A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY FOR LAWMAKERS TO HELP MORE FAMILIES PAY FOR CHILDCARE. AND INVEST IN GROWING THE SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE CARE FOR BABIES AND TODDLERS. AND BY DOING THAT AND SUPPORTING CHILDREN FROM THE BEGINNING OF THEIR LIFE IT WILL LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR A BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR EVERYONE THEY CHILDREN WILL BE READY FOR SCHOOL. THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT WE OF COURSE ARE ENDORSE AND SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL TO FIX THE LICENSE EXEMPT HOURLY RATE. TO MATCH LEGISLATIVE INTENT AND PAY PEOPLE A SOMEWHAT MORE FAIR WAGE THANK YOU.
