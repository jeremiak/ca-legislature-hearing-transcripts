STATE MANY OF WHICH YOU ARE PARTNER WITH REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. A WE ARE PROUD SPONSOR TWENTY SIXTY SIX AND WE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE THE CALLEA TO SEE FOR A FEW MOMENTS. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT LAST YEAR OF TO EXPAND THE EITC TO THE. SELF EMPLOYED CALIFORNIANS HOWEVER THERE IS MORE WORK TO DO THIS BILL DOES IT UNITED WAYS A LARGE COALITION OF CALLIE I TO SEE ADVOCATES BELIEVE THAT IF YOU WORK. YOU PAY YOUR TAXES YOU FILE YOUR TAX RETURNS AND MEET THE INCOME ELIGIBILITY GUIDELINES YOU SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO CALLIE ITC. TWENTY SIXTY SIX INSURERS THIS BY EXTENDING THE CREDIT ALL LOW INCOME WORKERS EIGHTEEN YEARS AND OLDER THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO GET BY. THIS WILL COVER YOUNG ADULTS JUST STARTING OUT SENIORS THAT ARE FORCED TO STAY IN THE WORK FORCE OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY FOUR. AND CERTAIN IMMIGRANT AB. ADULTS WHO FILE THEIR. TAX RETURNS WITH THE ITEM NUMBER. ONE IN THREE CALIFORNIANS STRUGGLED TO MEET BASIC LIVING COSTS ABOUT TWICE THE OFFICIAL POVERTY RATE. AND NINE AND TEN ARE LED BY WORKING ADULT ACCORDING TO OUR REAL COST MEASURE RESEARCH. THE POVERTY RATE AMONG SENIORS IS OVER TWENTY PERCENT AND GROWING. UNITED WAY. AND OUR PARTNER. VITA SITES AND WE KNOW FIRST HAND WHAT A DIFFERENCE EITC MAKES. SO WE WANT TO CATCH. MAKE SURE THAT CALLIE I TO SEE HAS BEEN A GREAT SUCCESS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT CONTINUES TO BE A GREAT SUCCESS AND BY STRENGTHENING IT THROUGH THE ADDING INCLUDING THE THREE GROUPS THAT AREN'T CURRENTLY EXCLUDED. A WE FEEL THAT THE ECONOMICS OF. SECURITY ISN'T WITHIN MORE. WORKERS REACH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. A GOOD AFTERNOON I'M ADAM CHECK COMMITTEE MEMBERS SEEM TO DISSOLVE A WITH THAT CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER RAS A CO SPONSOR ON AB TWENTY SIXTY SIX. I'M YOU KNOW INCLUSION I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE WE LOCK OUT CALIFORNIANS BASED ON IMMIGRATION STATUS IT NOT ONLY SET BACK FAMILIES A COMMUNITIES THAT REALLY DOES HURT OUR STATE. I IMMIGRANTS MAKE UP ONE THIRD OF OUR WORKFORCE BUT THEY'RE ALSO PARENTS TO OVER HALF OF THE KIDS IN OUR STATE AND AS TAXPAYERS THEY CONTRIBUTE THREE BILLION. AND STATE AND LOCAL TAXES YET THE SAME TAX FILERS WHEN THEY FALL ON HARD TIMES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS CREDIT TO KEEP A LITTLE MORE OF WHAT THEY EARN IN ORDER TO MAKE ENDS MEET. WE CAN REMOVE THESE EXCLUSIONS IN TWENTY SIXTY SIX BY HARNESSING EXISTING MECHANISMS LIKE THE FEDERALLY ASSIGNED TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER KNOWN AS A NIGHT TEN. IT WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX BY THE IRS SO THAT THE IRS HAD WAY TO PROCESS. TAX CLAIMS FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT DID NOT HAVE A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AND THE USE OF THE A TENS ALLOWS THE FOR IRIS TO BRING IN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY SINGLE YEAR AND FACT. AND TWENTY SIXTEEN THE R. S. THAT'S WHY I TEN FILERS PAID OVER TWENTY FOUR BILLION AND FEDERAL TAXES AND CALIFORNIA THERE'S AN ESTIMATED SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND I TEND TAX FILERS. AND RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE MAJORITY OF THESE FILERS ARE RESIDENTS OF REGIONS WITH HIGH AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT AND OR LARGE SPANISH SPEAKING POPULATIONS WHICH CERTAINLY ARE CHARACTERISTICS THAT MATCH NUMBER OF COUNTIES. IN OUR STATE SO UNFORTUNATELY WHILE THE NUMBER PROVIDES THESE INDIVIDUALS OPPORTUNITY TO FILE THEIR TAXES IT'S STILL INCLUDE EXCLUDES THEM FROM THE FEDERAL AND STATE EITC. AND SO THAT I TEN MAY BE NEW TO THE ATC BUT THEY'RE AN EXISTING CALIFORNIA TAX FURTHER POPULATION FOR OVER TWO DECADES. IN FACT WE'VE ALREADY STARTED HARNESSING THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE I TEN. THROUGH. ENTREPRENEURSHIP OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO MAKING SURE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO PROFESSIONAL LICENSES AND AN EFFORT THIS YEAR TO ALLOW ITEM HOLDERS TO APPLY FOR LOCAL BUSINESS LIFE AND SO THEY CAN START UP. A BUSINESS AND SUPPORT THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES I'M CERTAINLY THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD COMMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS I THINK DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY. TO STRENGTHEN OUR ANTI POVERTY EFFORTS BUT ALSO TO IMPROVE OUR TAX SYSTEM BY INCORPORATING NECESSARY MECHANISMS THAT REFLECT THE FULL BREADTH OF WHO ARE TAX PAIN POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA IS. ECONOMIC INCLUSION ALLOWS US TO CONTINUE ADVANCING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT PARTY AFFECTS MANY WORKERS REGARDLESS OF THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS IN FACT FOR HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE HEADED BY AN UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUAL. THERE ARE EARNING APPROXIMATELY SIXTEEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER YEAR SO IT'S REALLY CRITICAL THAT AT THIS TIME WE REALLY LOOK AT OPPORTUNITIES TO REMOVE THESE EXCLUSIONS. I'M FROM THE STATE EITC AND TO BUILD THE NECESSARY MECHANISMS FOR ALL TAX FILERS. THIS ALSO COMES AT A REALLY CRITICAL TIME WHEN FEDERALLY THE GOVERNMENT IS LOOKING AT STRIPPING AWAY ALL FORMS OF IMMIGRATION RELIEF FOR INDIVIDUALS SO THOSE ARE DR POPULATIONS AS A TPS POPULATIONS. THOSE INDIVIDUALS WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE A FEDERAL IF I SO SECURITY NUMBER BUT THEY WILL BE CUT OUT OF THE EITC MOVING FORWARD WHEN THEY LOSE THEIR IMMIGRATION RELIEF. OUR COMMITMENT TO ELIMINATING POVERTY SHOULD NOT STOP AT AN INDIVIDUAL'S IMMIGRATION STATUS THIS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD A MORE EQUITABLE POLICY AND TO IMPROVE THE IDC'S IMPACT AMONG LOW INCOME WORKING FAMILIES. WE THINK THE AUTHORS FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP AND OUR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU. SO IN MEMORY AS THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU THE IMPORTANCE OF AB TWO ZERO SIX SIX. THE KELLEY I T. C. EXTENSION BILL. POVERTY AFFECTS ALL OF US IT IMPACTS OUR LOCAL ECONOMIES IN OUR QUALITY OF LIFE. CURRENTLY OVER FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE IN THE STATE LIVE IN POVERTY. AT APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY NINE POINT FOUR PERCENT OF THOSE IN POVERTY LIVE IN FAMILIES WITH AT LEAST ONE WORKING ADULT. WORKING FAMILIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND THEREFORE CANNOT CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR LOCAL ECONOMY OR BUILD FINANCIAL SECURITY. THIS CAUSES A RIPPLE EFFECT THAT LEAVES OUR COMMUNITIES WITHOUT THE ADEQUATE RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITY FOR UPWARD ECONOMIC MOBILITY. THE GOOD NEWS IS WE HAVE THE POWER TO CHANGE THESE OUTCOMES WITH THE POWER TO PUT MONEY INTO THE POCKETS OF WORKING FAMILIES. WHO HAVE DONE EVERYTHING RIGHT? CAN'T GET AHEAD. EXPANDING THE CAL. CAL E. I. T. C. TO INCLUDE LOW INCOME WORKING ADULTS AGED EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR LOW INCOME WORKING SENIORS OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE. AND LOW INCOME WORKING IMMIGRANT FAMILIES WITH INDIVIDUAL TAX IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS IS THE RIGHT MOVE FOR CALIFORNIA. NOW IS THE TIME TO EXPAND THE KELLY I TO SEE AND MAKE IT INCLUSIVE AND EQUITABLE. FOR ALL LOW INCOME WORKING FAMILIES THE CALIFORNIA EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT HAS A PROVEN RECORD OF BEING ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE. POVERTY FIGHTING TOOLS IN CALIFORNIA. BY WORKING TO ALLEVIATE POVERTY BY EXPANDING KELLY I TO SEE. CALIFORNIA WILL UPLIFT THE MOST ECONOMICALLY DISTRESSED COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE. WE KNOW THE PROGRAM WORKS IT IS EFFICIENT EFFECTIVE AND EQUITABLE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MICHELLE STILL PREVENTS HE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND CALIFORNIA VERY PROUD TO CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. AND. URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I REALIZE THAT A MOTION A SECOND BUT WILL JUST READ A LITTLE BIT MORE. WILL TRY TO KEEP THIS. KEEP THIS. YOU KNOW QUICK RIGHT. I'D LIKE TO START OFF BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS ON PAGE FOUR THAT ALICE IS TO SPECIFY THE TAXPAYER WOULD NOT RECEIVE. THE TAX CREDIT FOR REIMBURSED EXPENSE AB TWENTY SEVEN AT THREE WOULD ESTABLISH A PERSONAL INCOME TAX CREDIT FOR HOME CARE SERVICES. PACIFIC LEAD THIS BILL ESTABLISHES THE MAXIMUM PERSONAL INCOME TAX TURN UP TO FIVE THOUSAND FOR INDIVIDUALS EARNING A HUNDRED THOUSAND OR LESS. THE LEGISLATURE MAY DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF THIS COURT AFTER THE FOUR YEAR SUNSET DATE. HOME CARE IS ROOTED IN THE PRINCIPLE THAT OLDER ADULTS SHOULD BE FREE TO AGE AT HOME WITH THE LEVEL OF CARE THEY NEED TO BE SAFE AND COMFORTABLE. PRIVATE PAY HOME CARE PROVIDERS WORK HARD TO ENSURE THEIR CLIENTS ARE ABLE TO LIVE AS INDEPENDENTLY AS POSSIBLE RECEIVING A SUPPORT THEY NEED. TO MAINTAIN A HIGH QUALITY OF LIFE AS YOU KNOW OUR POPULATION IS AGING RAPIDLY. I'M A MINUTE CUT SOME OF THE STUFF OUT AND. WITH ME TODAY'S ANNOUNCED USES BE THIS. UNTIL THE PROVIDE A FEW COMMENTS. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ARE MANY MISDIAGNOSIS IT THIS TIME I'M THE OWNER OF PRICE TAG CARE HOME CARE AGENCY HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AND BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR TEN YEARS AND WE PROVIDE A SHORT TERM OR LONG TERM CARE FOR FAMILIES. ABOUT TWO HUNDRED OF THEM IN A EVERY YEAR. AND THAT WE'RE SUPPORT OF THIS BILL FROM OUR EXPERIENCE SENIORS PREFERRED TO STAY AT HOME NINE OUT OF TEN AND THEY EAT SO THEY IN THE NEED TO REMAIN A SAFE AND ENGAGE THAT HALL. WITH HOME CARE SERVICES THERE'S A HUGE HUGE IMPACT ON THE REDUCTION IN FALSE TRIPS TO THE HOSPITAL. COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR MEDICAL CARE. AND CARE GIVERS HELPS BOUGHT CHANGES IN THEIR CONDITION THAT THEY CONVEY TO THE FAMILY AND THEY CONVEY TO MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS SAVING HEALTHCARE COSTS FROM PREVENTING. ISSUES. ADDITIONALLY HOME CARE SUPPORT SUPPORTS THE FAMILY AT OFTEN CASES AND AT FAMILY MEMBERS. CARING FOR NO THE PERSON DIED BEFORE THE WEATHER CARE FOR BECAUSE THE STRESS AND ENGAGEMENT AND CARE FOR THEM. OF. FOR THOSE AT HOME IT'S IMPORTANT TO AVOID ISOLATION AND DEPRESSION WHICH IS VERY COMMON. SO LET'S WARY THOUGHT FOR EXAMPLE TAKE A RECENT CLIENT OF OURS MISTER JARVIS HE'S AN EIGHTY FOUR YEAR OLD MAN WHO WAS HIS CHARGE FROM A HOSPITAL OR HOSPICE. HE CAME HOME BED BOUND STUCK IN BED. AND WITH LITTLE LIFE LEFT LEFT IN HIM ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO A FAMILY WAS AROUND BUT DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO HELP THEM I SAID AS MUCH AS SHE NEEDED. BANG GAZE TO SERVICES OF HOME CARE. JARVIS. ESTABLISH A GOOD REPORT WITH HIS CARE GIVERS HE STARTED PLAYING CARD GAMES WITH THEM HE STARTED TO BE ABLE TO WALK. HE STARTED TEACHING THEM GAMES. AND. NO. HE IS ENJOYING THE BEST QUALITY OF LIFE STILL A HOSPICE. BUT FOR THE LITTLE TIME HE HAS LEFT IT HAS MADE HUGE IMPACT FOR HIM AND HIS FAMILY. THE HOME CARE SERVICES ARE PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE UNFORTUNATELY I DO THAT. AND I KNOW SOME PEOPLE CAN AFFORD AND SOME DON'T THOSE ON THE HIGHER LEVEL INCOME CAN AFFORD IT BY THOSE IN THE VERY LOW LEVEL OF INCOME MAYBE CAN HEAL GET HELP FROM MEDI CAL AN IN HOME SUPPORT SERVICES. AND THE ONCE IN THE MIDDLE. CANNOT SO FAR THAT'S WHAT WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS BILL. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE RAINY PARKING BEHALF OF HOME INSTEAD IS SIXTY BUSINESS SO OWNERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

GIVING SHOWERS TRANSPORTING A CLIENT TO DOCTORS APPOINTMENTS AND FACILITATING OTHER A DEALS WHICH ARE ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING. LICENSE AGENCIES HAVE WELL TRAINED STAFF THEIR SCREEN BONDED AND INSURED. OF THROUGH THE LIFE EXPERIENCE OF SEEING MY GRANDPA STRUGGLE IN HELPING HIM ANY WAY I COULD.

THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TWO RECENT COURT DECISIONS HAS CREATED SUBSTANTIAL CONCERNS FOR OUR TREASURES AND TAX COLLECTORS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. TEXTILES NOW CONDUCTED VIA THE INTERNET OVER SEVERAL DAYS OPEN THE DOOR FOR AN ABUSE OF A LACK OF CLARITY IN THE STATE LAW.

OR DRIVING THANK YOU THANK YOU. OF THOSE IN OPPOSITION. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MISS MELENDEZ. THANK YOU. I JUST I HAVE A QUESTION YOU SHOULD YOU'RE TAKING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ARE YOU. I JUST WANNA BE CLEAR WHAT THE AMENDMENT IS BECAUSE THERE IS A QUESTION RELATING TO LIABILITIES SO SO THERE WERE THERE WERE AMENDMENTS PUT FORWARD BY THE COMMITTEE AND THERE AND THERE WERE OTHER. A MEMBER LIKE HIM WERE STILL JUST READ THEM. SO THE AMENDMENTS AGREED TO BY THE AUTHOR ARE TO DELETE THE LIABILITY PROVISIONS SUBDIVISION G.. EXPLICITLY ADDRESS INTERNET SALES TAX THAT LASTS LONGER THAN A DAY TO BETTER REFLECT THIS BILL SEEN TEN. THAT'S ON PAGE FOUR F. AND THEN FINALLY A TECHNICAL AMENDMENT TO LEAD AND NOT PAGE FIVE G.. SO THOSE ARE THE AMENDMENTS. THANK YOU APPRECIATE. SO. SO YOU CONFIRM THAT YOU'VE TAKEN THOSE AMENDMENTS. AND. YOU MAY CLOSE BACKREST VARIABLE. THANK YOU. SO THE CHAIR URGES TO PASS THIS BILL. THE ARGUMENTS ARE THE. THE POINT IS THAT THERE IS A QUESTION IN THE LAW. IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN A. WHEN THERE WAS A TAX LIABILITY. IT WOULD GO TO THE COURTHOUSE STEPS OR SOMETHING WE BE DONE VERY QUICKLY NOW THINGS GO ON THE INTERNET MAY TAKE SEVERAL DAYS. SO IN THE OLD DAYS WHO WAS CLEAR YOU EITHER YOU COULD DECLARE BANKRUPTCY BEFORE THE TAX AUCTION. BUT NOT. DURING IT AND THAT WAS PRETTY CLEAR. NOW THAT HE CAN GO FOR THREE DAYS THE JUDGES SAID HE'S NOT SURE WHAT THIS MEANS. THE AUCTION HAS ENDED BUT IT KINDA BEGAN AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO GET CLARITY AND IN THIS CASE TO BE GOING TO GO INTO BANKRUPTCY. YOU HAVE TO DO IT BEFORE. THE. NOT BEFORE THE AUCTION BEGINS SAID SO IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE BILL TO CLEAN UP THE LAW. AND CLEAN IT UP BUT I THINK AWAY THAT'S APPROPRIATE. ARE FOR EVERYONE SO WITH THAT.

MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'D LIKE THANK YOU AND. AND YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING ON THIS BILL WITH ME AND I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. ADD TO SHORT THE SUN STATE SUNSET DATA FIVE YEARS. TODAY I'M PROUD TO PRESENT AB TWENTY NINE FORTY FIVE WHICH PROMOTES JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PHYSICALLY DISABLED. BY OFFERING A TAX INCENTIVE FOR BUSINESSES TO EMPLOY PERSONS WITHOUT FUNCTIONAL HEARING. DEAFENED HARD OF HEARING INDIVIDUALS ARE NORMAL PEOPLE WHO ARE CAPABLE OF CONTRIBUTING TO CSUS TO SOCIETY IN A MEN'S WAYS. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I HAVE TO DEAF BROTHERS AND. AND THEY'RE BOTH THE MAYES INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT. BUT. I THINK A LOT OF TIMES. IN SOCIETY. PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE STIGMATIZED TO SET THE SOCIALLY OSTRACIZED. AND BARRED FROM EMPLOYMENT. BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SCARED OF THEY DON'T KNOW HOW THEY WOULD COMMUNICATE. WITH MODERN TECHNOLOGY. IT'S SO MUCH EASIER TO COMMUNICATE TO BE ABLE TO. YA WITH THE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING COMMUNITY. BUT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE FORTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT IN THE WORKFORCE UNEMPLOYED. THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF PROLONGED UNEMPLOYMENT CORRELATES WITH SIGNIFICANT INCREASES. AN ANXIETY DEPRESSION LOSS OF CONFIDENCE LOW SELF ESTEEM. WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE SEAS ARE CAPABLE PEOPLE WHO CAN CONTRIBUTE TO OUR SOCIETY. WE NEED TO REMOVE THE BARRIERS AND THIS IS ONE WAY TO PRO IS TO PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE. AFTER BUSINESSES TO HIRE MORE. DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING INDIVIDUALS BUT REALLY. INDIVIDUALS ACROSS THE BOARD WITH DISABILITIES AND. SO I IT WORKS WITH THE EXISTING STATE INFRASTRUCTURE TO MINIMIZE THE ADMINISTRATION COSTS AND WILL ULTIMATELY BENEFIT. THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND BY SOCIETY. BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION AS MATT I DO HAVE A WITNESS SUPPORT. AS SHERRIE FARINA WITH NOR CAL. CENTER ON. DEAFNESS AND. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE BUT WHEN THE TIME COMES. HELLO EVERYBODY MY NAME IS SHERRY FARINA. AND I'M THE CEO OF NOR HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING. SO WE COVER TWENTY FOUR NORTHERN EASTERN COUNTIES. AND. WE HAD AGENCIES WHAT WE SERVICE PEOPLE FROM THE BIRTH HIS TOMB A FEW WELL. AND WE CONTRACT WITH VARIOUS. GOVERNMENTAL AND AGENCIES ENTERPRISES LIKE DEPARTMENT OF REHAB FROM EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT CENTERS ANTI FF DEATH ACCESS PROGRAMS. AND ALTA REGIONAL CENTER. UP ALL OF THOSE PROGRAMS PROVIDE EMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE FOR A VARIETY OF IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS OF ITS JOB READINESS FOR PLACEMENT IF AND TRAIN IT TRAINING AND THAT'S NECESSARY FOR PLACEMENT. AND LIKE HE JUST MENTIONED ASSEMBLY MEMBER. MENTIONED ON A FORTY EIGHT PERCENT ON DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING INDIVIDUALS. AND IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN I'M. IN THAT REPORT SAYS THE DEAF PEOPLE EMPLOYEE EMPLOYMENT IN THE IN THE UNITED STATES IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IS LOW AND THE LARGEST PERCENT IS FORTY SEVEN PERCENT OF DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING PEOPLE ARE NOT IN THE EMPLOYMENT. I AM NOT EMPLOYED AND SOME AND OUR SPELLS THE STUDENTS ARE WITH EARLY RETIREMENT. BUT WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A LARGE PERCENT OF THEM THAT ON SS I AND SSD I. RELIANT ON THAT FOR DEAF PEOPLE WHO WORK FULL TIME AND ALSO WITH NAY REPORT NATURAL AND IN ANNUAL AND CRAM WHICH IS SAYING SIMILAR TO I'M HEARING INDIVIDUALS AND POPULATION. SO EDUCATIONAL GOAL ACADEMICS AND. I WOULD SAY AND THEY ADVANCED DEGREES AT CETERA AT THIS HELPS THEM TO ADD RECEIVE MORE JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMPLOYMENT. SEWED PEOPLE PEOPLE THAT ARE DEAF WHAT IS IT WITH A DISABILITIES AND ALSO OTHER DISABILITIES HAVE ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES. AND MOST OF THE THAT MOST THE BARRIERS THAT WE FORESEE OUT THERE IN THE COMMUNITIES HAD ISSUE. AND SO THAT PREVENTS EMPLOYERS FIVE HIRING DEAF PEOPLE. BUT AND THOSE THAT DO HIRE THEM AND ARE IN CONSTANT CONTACT WITH TAX CONSEQUENCE TACT IN THE WEEK PROVIDE CONTINUOUS SUPPORT SO THAT THEY CAN HIRE MORE DEAF INDIVIDUALS. LIKE FAT ACTS. I SAFE WAY TARGETS. AMAZON A GOOD WILL ETCETERA. AND SO THAT WE PROVIDE A TAX EX OR THERE ARE TAX INCENTIVES FOR THEM INCENTIVES FOR THEM TO PUT THE TO REDUCE THE VARIOUS FOR DEAF PEOPLE. IN THEIR EMPLOYMENT SO WE ASK FOR YOU TO SUB SUPPORT THE BILL. AND ASSEMBLY BILL TO NINE FOUR. BY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL INSISTS.
