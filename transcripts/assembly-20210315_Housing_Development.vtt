00:57:50.333 --> 00:57:51.968
CERTAINLY HAD AN ISSUE BEFORE

00:57:52.035 --> 00:57:54.103
COVERED WE HAVE EVEN MORE OF AN

00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:56.372
ISSUE FOR ALL OF OUR VULNERABLE

00:57:56.439 --> 00:57:58.808
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE FACING

00:57:58.875 --> 00:58:00.610
HOMELESSNESS. BUT IF YOU

00:58:00.677 --> 00:58:02.378
IMAGINE SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN

00:58:02.445 --> 00:58:04.347
INCARCERATED AND THE DEBT THAT

00:58:04.414 --> 00:58:06.316
IS STACKED AGAINST THEM THEY

00:58:06.382 --> 00:58:08.284
CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF

00:58:08.351 --> 00:58:10.887
OPPORTUNITIES GETTING OUT.

00:58:10.954 --> 00:58:11.487
AFTER THEY HAVE SERVED THEIR

00:58:11.554 --> 00:58:14.424
TIME. AND ALL TOO OFTEN WE SEE

00:58:14.490 --> 00:58:16.726
THE PATTERN REPEAT AND REPEAT

00:58:16.793 --> 00:58:19.562
AND REPEAT. ONE OF THE PROJECTS

00:58:19.629 --> 00:58:21.397
THAT IS OUT THERE THAT IS

00:58:21.464 --> 00:58:24.601
HIGHLY ACCLAIMED. IS A PROJECT

00:58:24.667 --> 00:58:26.336
CALLED PROJECT REBOUND IN THIS

00:58:26.402 --> 00:58:28.304
IS HOSTED AT CAL STATE

00:58:28.371 --> 00:58:31.841
FULLERTON. AND OTHER CSU'S BUT

00:58:31.908 --> 00:58:33.576
IT'S SIMPLY A FORMERLY

00:58:33.643 --> 00:58:35.845
INCARCERATED PERSON WHO IS

00:58:35.912 --> 00:58:37.947
INTERESTED IN GOING TO COLLEGE

00:58:38.014 --> 00:58:39.482
OR ALREADY HAS SOME COLLEGE

00:58:39.549 --> 00:58:42.418
EXPERIENCE. CAN MOVE INTO

00:58:42.485 --> 00:58:46.089
FULLER TEN IRWIN HOUSE AND SO

00:58:46.155 --> 00:58:48.558
IF YOU GET OUT OF. PRISON OR

00:58:48.625 --> 00:58:50.193
BEEN INCARCERATED YOU HAVE AN

00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:53.463
OPPORTUNITY TO REAP FOR HOUSING.

00:58:53.529 --> 00:58:55.398
ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE'S HOPE

00:58:55.465 --> 00:58:56.900
AND FOR THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:58:56.966 --> 00:58:59.435
LIVING AT THIS HOME. MANY OF

00:58:59.502 --> 00:59:01.337
MANY OF THEM ARE GRADUATING NOT

00:59:01.404 --> 00:59:03.273
ONLY WITH THE FOUR YEAR DEGREE

00:59:03.339 --> 00:59:06.142
BUT WITH MASTERS AND IN TURN

00:59:06.209 --> 00:59:07.110
GOING BACK TO SERVE THEIR

00:59:07.176 --> 00:59:08.711
COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S WHAT

00:59:08.778 --> 00:59:11.247
HOUSING CAN DO. NOT ONLY FOR

00:59:11.314 --> 00:59:13.016
FORMERLY INCARCERATED BUT FOR

00:59:13.082 --> 00:59:14.984
ANYONE TO HAVE A PLACE TO LAY

00:59:15.051 --> 00:59:17.453
YOUR HEAD A PLACE TO CALL HOME.

00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:22.058
SO I NOT ONLY SUPPORT THIS BUT

00:59:22.125 --> 00:59:24.227
BELIEVE THIS REALLY IS THE KEY.

00:59:24.294 --> 00:59:25.561
BUT IT'S ALSO THE KEY FOR

00:59:25.628 --> 00:59:28.564
TAXPAYERS WE ALL TO OFTEN ARE

00:59:28.631 --> 00:59:29.399
GOING TO PAY SOME WAY OR

00:59:29.465 --> 00:59:31.434
ANOTHER WE'RE PAYING WHILE

00:59:31.501 --> 00:59:32.802
THEY'RE IN PRISON WE PAY WHEN

00:59:32.869 --> 00:59:34.537
THEY GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOMS

00:59:34.604 --> 00:59:37.440
AND WE PAY A LOT IN MANY WAYS

00:59:37.507 --> 00:59:39.342
WHEN MANY TIMES THEY RETURN TO

00:59:39.409 --> 00:59:41.844
BEHAVIORS THAT CAN ASSAULTER

00:59:41.911 --> 00:59:44.013
COMMUNITIES. SO I'M ABOUT

00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:45.715
LOOKING TOWARDS OPTIMISM AND

00:59:45.782 --> 00:59:48.318
HOPE AND LOOKING AT WAYS THAT

00:59:48.384 --> 00:59:50.887
WE CAN REIMAGINE. FOR THOSE WHO

00:59:50.954 --> 00:59:52.789
HAVE ASCENDED HOW CAN THEY COME

00:59:52.855 --> 00:59:54.757
BACK INTO OUR COMMUNITIES AND

00:59:54.824 --> 00:59:56.926
BECOME THE RESPONSIBLE ADULTS

00:59:56.993 --> 00:59:58.561
THAT WE WANT THEM TO BE. I

00:59:58.628 --> 01:00:02.165
FULLY SUPPORT AB THREE TWENTY

THAT'S NOT ENOUGH WE ALSO HAVE

01:01:07.797 --> 01:01:09.632
TO PUT OUR INVESTMENT IN A

01:01:09.699 --> 01:01:11.167
THOUGHTFULNESS INTO WHAT

01:01:11.234 --> 01:01:11.968
HAPPENS WHEN SOMEONE GETS

01:01:12.035 --> 01:01:13.870
RELEASED AND- WELL THAT'S WHAT

I THINK AND REALLY DO HOPE-

01:01:25.982 --> 01:01:28.317
WILL BECOME A MODEL. FOR HOW

01:01:28.384 --> 01:01:30.553
YOU REALLY DEAL WITH THE-

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:32.622
GLOBAL ISSUES THAT SOMEONE HAS

01:01:32.688 --> 01:01:33.823
WHEN THEY GET RELEASED TO MAKE

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:35.925
SURE FIRST AND FOREMOST. THAT

01:01:35.992 --> 01:01:37.260
THEY HAVE A ROOF OVER THEIR

01:01:37.326 --> 01:01:39.028
HEAD- BECAUSE ALL THE OTHER

01:01:39.095 --> 01:01:40.430
ISSUES CAN BE RESOLVED IF THEY

01:01:40.496 --> 01:01:42.165
DON'T HAVE. A STABLE PLACE TO

01:01:42.231 --> 01:01:43.332
LIVE AND WE'VE CERTAINLY SEEN

01:01:43.399 --> 01:01:45.168
THAT- DURING THE COVERAGE

01:01:45.234 --> 01:01:47.003
CRISIS AS FOLKS HAVE BEEN

01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:48.938
RELEASED THAT. THEIR ISSUES

01:01:49.005 --> 01:01:50.473
DON'T END WITH THEM GETTING

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:51.874
RELEASED FROM THE STATE OF

01:01:51.941 --> 01:01:53.776
INCARCERATION IN MANY WAYS-

01:01:53.843 --> 01:01:55.011
THEIR ISSUES ARE JUST BEGINNING

01:01:55.078 --> 01:01:56.646
OF THE END AND THE DOMINO

01:01:56.712 --> 01:01:58.448
EFFECT. ALL STARS WITH HOUSING

01:01:58.514 --> 01:02:03.619
SO OF A VERY HAPPY. SUPPORT

01:02:03.686 --> 01:02:04.854
AGAIN WANT TO THANK ARCHER.

01:02:04.921 --> 01:02:10.960
ANYONE ELSE. L. CLOSE AND SO

01:02:11.027 --> 01:02:15.198
THIS IS A THIS ISSUE WITH REESE

01:02:15.264 --> 01:02:17.667
RECIDIVISM IS REALLY M. S. IT'S

01:02:17.733 --> 01:02:20.736
AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND IT ISN'T

01:02:20.803 --> 01:02:22.238
ALWAYS JUST ABOUT THE HOUSING

01:02:22.305 --> 01:02:23.906
THAT'S WHAT ONE OF MY CONCERNS

01:02:23.973 --> 01:02:24.874
IS THE BILL AS THERE'S A LOT OF

01:02:24.941 --> 01:02:26.542
MONEY BEING PUT INTO THE

01:02:26.609 --> 01:02:28.611
HOUSING COMPONENT WHEN THERE

01:02:28.678 --> 01:02:30.146
ARE TWO EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT

01:02:30.213 --> 01:02:31.214
OTHER COMPONENTS AND THAT'S

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.716
ADDICTION AND JOB TRAINING AND

01:02:33.783 --> 01:02:35.852
AS MR MERRILEES HAD SAID SO

01:02:35.918 --> 01:02:38.054
ELOQUENTLY ON IT WHEN HE WAS

01:02:38.121 --> 01:02:41.524
SPEAKING TO WITNESS- EIGHTY HE

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:43.593
HAD. A LOT OF THE TOOLS YOU

01:02:43.659 --> 01:02:45.495
NEED TO GET A JOB BUT HE DIDN'T

01:02:45.561 --> 01:02:47.396
HAVE THAT TYPE LINE TO GET THE

01:02:47.463 --> 01:02:49.365
JOB BECAUSE THAT JOB IS WHAT

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:51.033
ULTIMATELY PAYS FOR THEM TO BE

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:53.236
SUCCESSFUL AND NOT ONLY GETTING

01:02:53.302 --> 01:02:55.271
HOUSING BY KEEPING HOUSING AND

01:02:55.338 --> 01:02:56.272
WHILE I THINK THIS HOUSING

01:02:56.339 --> 01:02:58.875
ELEMENT OF IT IS VERY IMPORTANT

01:02:58.941 --> 01:03:00.343
IT'S ONE POINT FIVE BILLION

01:03:00.409 --> 01:03:02.812
DOLLARS IT SEEMS TO BE BEING

01:03:02.879 --> 01:03:04.814
JUST SPENT TOWARDS THE HOUSING

01:03:04.881 --> 01:03:06.215
BUT NOT TOWARDS THE ADDICTION

01:03:06.282 --> 01:03:08.251
PROGRAMS AND THE JOB TRAINING

01:03:08.317 --> 01:03:09.685
PROGRAMS WHETHER THAT BE

01:03:09.752 --> 01:03:11.821
TECHNICAL EDUCATION OR DEGREE

01:03:11.888 --> 01:03:14.590
PROGRAMS. AND THOSE PROGRAMS

01:03:14.657 --> 01:03:16.993
ARE ARE UNDER SERVED IN OUR

01:03:17.059 --> 01:03:20.429
PRISONS AS AS I HAVE HAD

01:03:20.496 --> 01:03:22.398
CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE ABOUT

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:24.400
WHY WHY ARE WE NOT SUCCESSFUL

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:25.801
IN THAT WHY ARE WE NOT

01:03:25.868 --> 01:03:27.336
EDUCATING MORE PEOPLE WHY ARE

01:03:27.403 --> 01:03:29.305
WE NOT GETTING THEM READY TO

01:03:29.372 --> 01:03:31.307
COME OUTSIDE AND BE SUCCESSFUL

01:03:31.374 --> 01:03:33.142
SO THAT THAT'S MY CONCERN IS

01:03:33.209 --> 01:03:35.111
THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE

01:03:35.178 --> 01:03:36.846
NINE AGENCIES THAT DO FORTY ONE

01:03:36.913 --> 01:03:40.950
PROGRAMS. TO HELP HOMELESSNESS-

01:03:41.017 --> 01:03:41.617
OUR HELP WITH THE HOMELESS

01:03:41.684 --> 01:03:44.320
PROBLEM AND WE'RE JUST NOT

01:03:44.387 --> 01:03:48.925
SUCCESSFUL AND WE SPEND. THREE

01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:49.559
BILLION DOLLARS AND WE'RE GOING

01:03:49.625 --> 01:03:50.126
TO SPEND MORE. BUT SOMEHOW

01:03:50.193 --> 01:03:51.060
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO CONSOLIDATE

01:03:51.127 --> 01:03:54.030
THESE. INTO SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS

01:03:54.096 --> 01:03:54.630
AND HAVE THEM BE MORE

01:03:54.697 --> 01:03:57.400
COORDINATED- SO THOSE ARE JUST

01:03:57.466 --> 01:04:00.002
SOME OF MY CONCERNS WITH IT-

01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:02.605
THAT TO ADD AT THIS TIME- WE

01:04:02.672 --> 01:04:04.440
HAVE A MOTION BY COURT MISTER

01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:06.375

THE VICE CHAIR. I'M NOT SURE IF

THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A

01:04:21.557 --> 01:04:23.159
MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT

01:04:23.226 --> 01:04:24.694
THIS MONEY WOULD BE USED FOR

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:26.996
BUT- THIS MONEY WOULD VERY MUCH

01:04:27.063 --> 01:04:28.097

FEET. AND GET THEM TO BE
