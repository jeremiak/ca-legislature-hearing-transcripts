00:22:51.169 --> 00:22:51.703
AN IMPORTANT OBJECTIVE BECAUSE

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:53.105
IN CALIFORNIA TODAY IF YOU GET

00:22:53.171 --> 00:22:53.705

COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- MY FOR IS

00:40:49.046 --> 00:40:49.446
IT ONE OF PART OF THE

00:40:49.513 --> 00:40:51.682
GOVERNOR'S VISION OF HOW THIS

00:40:51.749 --> 00:40:53.450
PROJECTS GOING TO ROLL OUT AND

00:40:53.517 --> 00:40:57.087
WHY- WE SHOULD BE. INVESTING IN

00:40:57.154 --> 00:40:58.923
THIS SECTION OF PROJECT IS TO

00:40:58.989 --> 00:41:00.891
DEMONSTRATE BY ABILITY. AND TO

00:41:00.958 --> 00:41:03.327
HOPEFULLY ATTRACT PRIVATE

00:41:03.394 --> 00:41:05.196
INVESTMENT TO HELP COMPLETE THE

00:41:05.262 --> 00:41:07.264
REST OF THE SYSTEM AND I'M

00:41:07.331 --> 00:41:09.099
WONDERING WHAT YOU SEE AS THE

00:41:09.166 --> 00:41:11.235
SORT OF THRESHOLD THAT WOULD

00:41:11.302 --> 00:41:13.637
DEMONSTRATE THAT- AND WHETHER

00:41:13.704 --> 00:41:15.673
YOU'VE HAD ANY INTEREST FROM

00:41:15.739 --> 00:41:17.007
PRIVATE INVESTMENT AT THIS

00:41:17.074 --> 00:41:19.376
POINT SORT OF WHAT WOULD IT

00:41:19.443 --> 00:41:21.278
TAKE TO TOLD THAT BALANCE. THIS

00:41:21.345 --> 00:41:21.846
THAT AND SO WHERE WHERE IS

00:41:21.912 --> 00:41:24.915
THEIR LEVEL IF YOU GO FROM ONE

00:41:24.982 --> 00:41:25.416
TO TEN WHERE IS PRIVATE

00:41:25.482 --> 00:41:27.518
INVESTMENT NOW ON THIS. ON

00:41:27.585 --> 00:41:30.955
HELPING TO COMPLETE THE ENTIRE

00:41:31.021 --> 00:41:31.622
PROJECT AND WHAT WOULD IT TAKE

00:41:31.689 --> 00:41:33.157
TO GET THEM UP TO TWO TEN

00:41:33.224 --> 00:41:34.859
THEY'RE KINDA IN. I THINK

00:41:34.925 --> 00:41:35.492
IDEALLY FOR PRIVATE INVESTMENT

00:41:35.559 --> 00:41:37.194
IN THAT THIS PROJECT THEY WOULD

00:41:37.261 --> 00:41:39.463
WANT TO SEE A DEMONSTRATION

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:41.131
THAT- YOU CAN RUN A FOR PROFIT

00:41:41.198 --> 00:41:43.534
SERVICES ACTUALLY THAT YOUR NET

00:41:43.601 --> 00:41:44.168
REVENUES WILL EXCEED YOUR NET

00:41:44.235 --> 00:41:46.904
COST- IN OUR VALLEY THE VALLEY

00:41:46.971 --> 00:41:47.504
APPROACH FROM BAKERSFIELD TO

00:41:47.571 --> 00:41:48.939
SAN FRANCISCO WE- WE SEE WE

00:41:49.006 --> 00:41:51.475
PROPOSE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE

00:41:51.542 --> 00:41:53.210
TO. TO DO THAT- SO THE

00:41:53.277 --> 00:41:53.777
DISCONNECTION NOTICE RIGHT

00:41:53.844 --> 00:41:55.045
CLOSE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT SO

00:41:55.112 --> 00:41:57.514
HOW DO YOU DO THAT IN THIS

00:41:57.581 --> 00:41:58.148
SECTION THIS SECTION WILL NOT

00:41:58.215 --> 00:41:59.350
DEMONSTRATE THAT WITH THIS

00:41:59.416 --> 00:42:00.918
SECTION WILL DO OTHER THINGS

00:42:00.985 --> 00:42:02.953
THAT ARE IMPORTANT- THIS

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:05.122
SECTION FOR US- WILSHIRE THE

00:42:05.189 --> 00:42:05.689
ASSETS THAT WE ARE SPENDING

00:42:05.756 --> 00:42:08.959
BILLIONS TO BUILDING THIS PART

00:42:09.026 --> 00:42:09.560
OF THE STATE WILL NOT GO TO

00:42:09.627 --> 00:42:12.863
WASTE. WE'LL PUT TO USE IT WILL

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:13.464
BE PUT TO USE FOR ELECTRIFIED

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:15.299
HIGH SPEED RAIL CONSISTENT WITH

00:42:15.366 --> 00:42:17.134
OUR MISSION UNDER THE LAW IN SO

00:42:17.201 --> 00:42:19.403
AND IT WILL REDUCE TRAVEL TIMES

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:21.171
TO CLEAN UP THE AIR- AND WILL

00:42:21.238 --> 00:42:24.875
PROVIDE A BETTER TRANSPORTATION

00:42:24.942 --> 00:42:25.509
SYSTEM IN AN AREA OF THE STATE

00:42:25.576 --> 00:42:26.844
THAT HAS LITTLE PUBLIC TRANSIT-

00:42:26.911 --> 00:42:29.313
AND SO THAT IS. WHY WE WANT TO

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:31.248
START THERE AGAIN WE

00:42:31.315 --> 00:42:33.017
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE- SORT OF

00:42:33.083 --> 00:42:35.352
BREAK POINT ON THE OPERATIONS

00:42:35.419 --> 00:42:41.025
VERSUS COST STRETCH IS. LIKELY

00:42:41.091 --> 00:42:41.659
BAKERSFIELD ALL THE WAY THE BAY

00:42:41.725 --> 00:42:45.262
TO SAN FRANCISCO. WE DON'T HAVE

00:42:45.329 --> 00:42:47.197
ALL THE MONEY WE NEED TO BUILD

00:42:47.264 --> 00:42:47.831
THAT STRETCH YET IT'S STILL OUR

00:42:47.898 --> 00:42:49.166
OBJECTIVE- BUT WE'RE GOING TO

00:42:49.233 --> 00:42:49.767
FINISH THAT ENVIRONMENTAL WORK

00:42:49.833 --> 00:42:50.367
AND THAT'S THE OTHER. POINT I

00:42:50.434 --> 00:42:50.935
WANT TO MAKE. TO REALLY GET

00:42:51.001 --> 00:42:51.535
ENVIRONMENTAL INTERESTS- IN

00:42:51.602 --> 00:42:53.804
THESE TYPES OF MAKE A PROJECTS

00:42:53.871 --> 00:42:54.371
MISSED THAT THIS TYPE OF

00:42:54.438 --> 00:42:57.074
PROJECT. YOU HAVE TO REDUCE

00:42:57.141 --> 00:42:59.009
RISKS OR THEY WILL NOT PLAY. IN

00:42:59.076 --> 00:42:59.643
EYES SO I THINK THE WAY YOU DO

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:01.178
THAT IS YOU GET THE

00:43:01.245 --> 00:43:03.013
ENVIRONMENTAL WORK DONE. IN SO

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:05.015
WHEN I TALK ABOUT GETTING ALL

00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:05.649
OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL WORK DONE

00:43:05.716 --> 00:43:07.451
IN THE NEXT. EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY

00:43:07.518 --> 00:43:09.253
FOUR MONTHS. TO ME THAT AS A

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:10.821
PRECURSOR TO REALLY. INVITING A

00:43:10.888 --> 00:43:13.190
LOT OF PRIVATE SECTOR

00:43:13.257 --> 00:43:13.857
OPPORTUNITY ON THIS PROJECT IN

00:43:13.924 --> 00:43:15.392
TERMS OF MEETING. HELPING ME

00:43:15.459 --> 00:43:17.261
CAPITAL COSTS. BUT THE OTHER

00:43:17.328 --> 00:43:17.861
THING I MUST SAY BECAUSE ITS

00:43:17.928 --> 00:43:19.330
THE NEWEST AND MOST EXCITING.

00:43:19.396 --> 00:43:21.398
DEVELOPMENT ON THIS PROJECT FOR

00:43:21.465 --> 00:43:23.267
THE FIRST TIME. PRIVATE SECTOR

00:43:23.334 --> 00:43:24.868
INTERESTED DEMONSTRATED WITH

00:43:24.935 --> 00:43:25.436
THE VIRGIN TRAIN SYSTEM IN

00:43:25.502 --> 00:43:27.104
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AGAIN

00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:31.275
THEY'RE TAKING THE RISK ON. THE

00:43:31.342 --> 00:43:31.909
FIRST SEGMENT OF THAT AGAIN A

00:43:31.976 --> 00:43:32.943
BUILDING BLOCK APPROACH. LAS

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:35.112
VEGAS TO VICTORVILLE. AND THEY

00:43:35.179 --> 00:43:37.081
ALL TO MILLIE ARE GOING TO NEED

00:43:37.147 --> 00:43:39.216
HELP TO GET THE PALMDALE. BUT I

00:43:39.283 --> 00:43:41.251
KNOW I'VE TALKED WITH. THEY

00:43:41.318 --> 00:43:43.120
HAVE NO INTENTION OF HAVING A

00:43:43.187 --> 00:43:45.055
LAS VEGAS RUN BE. LAS VEGAS TO

00:43:45.122 --> 00:43:45.622
VICTOR. THEY WANNA GET TO

00:43:45.689 --> 00:43:47.491
PALMDALE AND THEY WANT TO GET

00:43:47.558 --> 00:43:48.993
TO LOS ANGELES. AND THEY WANT

00:43:49.059 --> 00:43:51.028
TO DO IT ON SHARED. ASSETS THAT

00:43:51.095 --> 00:43:53.297
WE BOTH HAVE. A BECAUSE THAT'S

00:43:53.364 --> 00:43:53.797
HOW YOU DO IT UNDER THE

00:43:53.864 --> 00:43:57.034
QUICKEST. TRAVEL TIME POSSIBLE.

00:43:57.101 --> 00:43:59.169
IN SO- CLEARING THAT

00:43:59.236 --> 00:44:00.971
ENVIRONMENTAL WORK. ENTERING IN

00:44:01.038 --> 00:44:01.672
M. WITH THEM ON HOW WE MIGHT BE

00:44:01.739 --> 00:44:03.140
ABLE TO PROCEED TOGETHER. IN

00:44:03.207 --> 00:44:05.042
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO CLOSE

00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:07.011
THAT LOOP I THINK. OF THOSE ARE

00:44:07.077 --> 00:44:09.179
IMPORTANT STEPS IN FRONT OF US

00:44:09.246 --> 00:44:09.847
BUT IN ESSENCE I GUESS WHAT I'M

00:44:09.913 --> 00:44:11.348
SAYING IS. TO ATTRACT PRIVATE

00:44:11.415 --> 00:44:13.117
SECTOR INVESTMENT. YOU NEED TO

00:44:13.183 --> 00:44:15.219
REDUCE RISK. AND WHEN WE DO

00:44:15.285 --> 00:44:15.652
THAT IS GET ALL THE

00:44:15.719 --> 00:44:17.254
ENVIRONMENTAL WORK DONE. AND

00:44:17.321 --> 00:44:19.289
THEN SECONDLY- YOU WANT TO

00:44:19.356 --> 00:44:19.890
DEMONSTRATE THE VIABILITY OF

00:44:19.957 --> 00:44:21.191
THE PROGRAM. SO IT'S THAT

00:44:21.258 --> 00:44:22.893
SECOND PART THAT I'M ASKING

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.862
ABOUT YEAH AS I UNDERSTAND.

00:44:24.928 --> 00:44:27.197
THAT THERE'S A PROPOSITION AND

00:44:27.264 --> 00:44:27.831
THERE'S FUNDING AND- YOU HAVE

00:44:27.898 --> 00:44:29.133
TO SPEND IT. AND I UNDERSTAND

00:44:29.199 --> 00:44:31.335
THE PART ABOUT. DOING THE

00:44:31.402 --> 00:44:33.003
ENVIRONMENTAL WORK SO THAT YOU

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:34.938
REDUCE THAT RISK AND YOU GET

00:44:35.005 --> 00:44:37.141
READY TO. LAY YOUR- PROJECT

00:44:37.207 --> 00:44:39.209
OUT- IT'S THE BUILDING BLOCK

00:44:39.276 --> 00:44:41.045
PART THAT I'M TRYING TO

00:44:41.111 --> 00:44:41.612
UNDERSTAND THE LINK BETWEEN

00:44:41.678 --> 00:44:43.080
THIS PARTICULAR BUILDING BLOCK.

00:44:43.147 --> 00:44:45.015
AND THEN TRADING BY ABILITY. SO

00:44:45.082 --> 00:44:45.616
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT TO

00:44:45.682 --> 00:44:49.553
SEE. OUT OF THIS IN TERMS OF

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:55.159
SORT OF INCREASE RIDERSHIP. AND

00:44:55.225 --> 00:44:55.726
HOW DOES THIS. INTO THAT TO

00:44:55.793 --> 00:44:57.294
REALLY DEMONSTRATE THAT I

00:44:57.361 --> 00:44:57.895
ABILITY BECAUSE I AGREE WITH

00:44:57.961 --> 00:44:58.529
YOU I THINK THAT DEMONSTRATING

00:44:58.595 --> 00:44:59.196
THAT PEOPLE. ARE WILLING TO

00:44:59.263 --> 00:44:59.830
TAKE TRAINS. IS VERY IMPORTANT

00:44:59.897 --> 00:45:01.165
TO GETTING THE INTEREST FOR THE

00:45:01.231 --> 00:45:02.933
SYSTEM WIDE HIGH SPEED RAIL.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.269
BUT WHY IS THIS SECTION AND THE

00:45:05.335 --> 00:45:05.803
INVESTMENT IN THIS SECTION

00:45:05.869 --> 00:45:07.571
GOING TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IS

00:45:07.638 --> 00:45:09.306
SUPPOSED TO. AND INVESTMENT

00:45:09.373 --> 00:45:11.008
THAT WE MIGHT HAVE HAD IN

00:45:11.075 --> 00:45:11.642
ANOTHER SECTION BECAUSE THERE'S

00:45:11.708 --> 00:45:13.143
NO OTHER SECTION IN THE STATE

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:15.446
OF CALIFORNIA WILL WE CAN

00:45:15.512 --> 00:45:16.013
REMOVE TRAIN TO TWO HUNDRED

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:16.980
MILES PER HOUR. ELECTRIFIED SO

00:45:17.047 --> 00:45:19.183
WITH THAT AND WHAT WHEN WHY I

00:45:19.249 --> 00:45:19.817
THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT. IS

00:45:19.883 --> 00:45:21.718
BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE YOU GET

00:45:21.785 --> 00:45:25.022
THE TIME SAVINGS THAT YOU CAN

00:45:25.089 --> 00:45:25.589
PRESENT WITH THIS KIND OF A

00:45:25.656 --> 00:45:26.156
SYSTEM SO LET'S TALK ABOUT

00:45:26.223 --> 00:45:29.126
THAT. SO NOW I TO I UNDERSTAND

00:45:29.193 --> 00:45:29.626
THE TIME SAVINGS. FROM

00:45:29.693 --> 00:45:35.032
BAKERSFIELD TO MERCED. IT'S A

00:45:35.099 --> 00:45:35.632
BIG DISTANCE. AND YOU'RE GONNA

00:45:35.699 --> 00:45:37.101
HAVE A MUCH FASTER TRAIN. BUT

00:45:37.167 --> 00:45:37.634
LET'S SAY YOU'RE YOU'RE IN

00:45:37.701 --> 00:45:38.202
FRESNO YOU'RE RIGHT HERE IN

00:45:38.268 --> 00:45:41.071
FRESNO. AND YOU WANT TO GO TO

00:45:41.138 --> 00:45:43.040
THE BAY AREA. AND MY

00:45:43.107 --> 00:45:43.674
UNDERSTANDING FROM SPEAKING TO

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:45.476
YOU EARLIER IS THAT IT'S YOUR

00:45:45.542 --> 00:45:47.277
HOPE THAT ONCE THE SECTION IS

00:45:47.344 --> 00:45:49.113
COMPLETED. THE AMTRAK TRAIN

00:45:49.179 --> 00:45:51.215
THAT RIGHT NOW IS REDUNDANT

00:45:51.281 --> 00:45:53.250
WITH THAT ROUTE. THAT YOU'LL

00:45:53.317 --> 00:45:53.784
HAVE LESS OF THOSE AMTRAK

00:45:53.851 --> 00:45:57.087
TRAINS. WILL INSTEAD BE TAKING

00:45:57.154 --> 00:45:59.389
THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. SO FROM

00:45:59.456 --> 00:46:01.291
FRESNO. GO TO MERCED WHICH IS

00:46:01.358 --> 00:46:03.494
ONE STOP. AND THEN YOU CHANGE

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:07.131
TRAINS. AND THEN YOU CONTINUE

00:46:07.197 --> 00:46:07.631
TO THE BAY AREA OR TO

00:46:07.698 --> 00:46:09.466
SACRAMENTO ON WHEREVER YOU'RE

00:46:09.533 --> 00:46:11.435
GOING. NOW IT SEEMS TO ME THAT

00:46:11.502 --> 00:46:13.337
YOUR TIME SAVING THAT POINT

00:46:13.403 --> 00:46:15.339
BECOMES ESSENTIALLY A WASH.

00:46:15.405 --> 00:46:17.141
BECAUSE I DON'T SEE HOW YOU GET

00:46:17.207 --> 00:46:19.009
PEOPLE OFF THE TRAIN AND BACK

00:46:19.076 --> 00:46:19.610
ON THE OTHER TRAIN WITH THEIR

00:46:19.676 --> 00:46:23.147
BAGGAGE AND STROLLERS. I DON'T

00:46:23.213 --> 00:46:25.015
KNOW FIFTEEN TWENTY MINUTES. I

00:46:25.082 --> 00:46:25.649
TAKE THE TRAIN A LOT I HAVE TO

00:46:25.716 --> 00:46:27.351
CHANGE TRAINS AT UNION STATION

00:46:27.417 --> 00:46:29.186
ALL THE TIME AND YOU'RE TALKING

00:46:29.253 --> 00:46:30.921
JUST METRO TO METRO OR AMTRAK

00:46:30.988 --> 00:46:32.990
TO METRO. THAT AMTRAK TRAINS IS

00:46:33.056 --> 00:46:34.992
THERE FOR QUITE AWHILE AND

00:46:35.058 --> 00:46:35.659
THAT'S BEST CASE SCENARIO THAT

00:46:35.726 --> 00:46:37.394
YOU ARRIVE ON HIGH SPEED RAIL

00:46:37.461 --> 00:46:39.029
AND YOU'VE GOT THE AMTRAK

00:46:39.096 --> 00:46:41.231
TRAIN. WAITING READY TO GO

00:46:41.298 --> 00:46:43.000
THEY'VE PUT THE FOOD ON IT

00:46:43.066 --> 00:46:45.002
THEIR GEAR THEY'RE READY TO GO

00:46:45.068 --> 00:46:45.602
YOU'RE STILL TALKING AT LEAST

00:46:45.669 --> 00:46:47.271
FIFTEEN MINUTES TO GET PEOPLE

00:46:47.337 --> 00:46:47.905
FROM ONE THE OTHER MAYBE TWENTY

00:46:47.971 --> 00:46:49.473
MINUTES. SO FOR FRESNO GROUP

00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:51.408
WHO GETS ON IN FRESNO. IT

00:46:51.475 --> 00:46:51.942
DOESN'T SEEM THAT YOU'RE

00:46:52.009 --> 00:46:54.912
OFFERING THEM ANY TIME SAVING

00:46:54.978 --> 00:46:55.512
BUT YOU ARE ASKING THEM TO

00:46:55.579 --> 00:46:56.980
CHANGE TRAINS NOW IN THE MIDDLE

00:46:57.047 --> 00:46:57.648
I THINK THEY'LL HAVE MORE THAN

00:46:57.714 --> 00:46:59.283
ONE OPTION MY SENSE OF IT IS

00:46:59.349 --> 00:47:01.051
ELEVEN OPTIONS THE

00:47:01.118 --> 00:47:01.552
UNCONVENTIONAL RAIL. IN

00:47:01.618 --> 00:47:03.153
SICKENING GO FROM FRESNO TO

00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:05.055
OAKLAND OR PRESENT TO

00:47:05.122 --> 00:47:05.722
SACRAMENTO UNDER THAT AMOUNT OF

00:47:05.789 --> 00:47:07.724
TIME IT TAKES TO TRAVEL ON THAT

00:47:07.791 --> 00:47:09.393
TODAY BUT YOU SAID THEY WERE

00:47:09.459 --> 00:47:11.094
GOING TO BE REDUCING THAT YES

00:47:11.161 --> 00:47:11.695
SEVEN TO NINE TRIPS A DAY TO

00:47:11.762 --> 00:47:13.297
TREAT THEIR WILL WELL. AS I

00:47:13.363 --> 00:47:15.199
SAID EARLIER SUBJECT TO AN

00:47:15.265 --> 00:47:17.301
OPERATING GREEN WE HAVE NOT YET

00:47:17.367 --> 00:47:17.834
COMPLETED. WITH OUR LOCAL

00:47:17.901 --> 00:47:19.303
PARTNERS BUT HERE'S HERE'S A

00:47:19.369 --> 00:47:21.171
WE'RE INTENDING TO DO. RIGHT

00:47:21.238 --> 00:47:23.473
NOW IN MERCED THERE'S AN AMTRAK

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:25.342
STATION ONE LOCATION AND NO A

00:47:25.409 --> 00:47:27.144
STATION AT ALL. THE STATE OF

00:47:27.211 --> 00:47:29.179
CALIFORNIA THE LEGISLATURE

00:47:29.246 --> 00:47:31.481
INVESTED EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION

00:47:31.548 --> 00:47:33.150
DOLLARS IN GETTING H. TO

00:47:33.217 --> 00:47:35.118
MERCED. INCREASING THE NUMBER

00:47:35.185 --> 00:47:36.820
OF TRIPS AND AMTRAK TAKE INTO

00:47:36.887 --> 00:47:39.189
MERCED WE ARE PROPOSING TO DO

00:47:39.256 --> 00:47:40.891
IS HAVE THE AMTRAK STATION THE

00:47:40.958 --> 00:47:41.425
MERCED STATION IN THE HIGH

00:47:41.491 --> 00:47:43.327

TO ONE PLACE IN MERCED. AND

00:47:51.235 --> 00:47:51.768
THEN TRANSFERS AND THINGS LIKE

00:47:51.835 --> 00:47:53.070
THAT WILL BE SIMPLER I DON'T

00:47:53.136 --> 00:47:54.938
KNOW WHAT THE TRAVEL TIME IS

00:47:55.005 --> 00:47:57.174
FROM FRESNO TO MERCED BECAUSE

00:47:57.241 --> 00:47:57.741
WE HAVEN'T ITEM MODEL THAT.

00:47:57.808 --> 00:47:59.343
WHAT I HAVE MODELED IS MERCED

00:47:59.409 --> 00:48:07.117
TO BAKERSFIELD IN THE NINETEEN.

00:48:07.184 --> 00:48:07.751
HUNDRED MINUTE REDUCTION VERSUS

00:48:07.818 --> 00:48:13.190
TRAVEL TIME TODAY. SO YES IF

00:48:13.257 --> 00:48:13.857
THEY CHOOSE HIGH SPEED RAIL THE

00:48:13.924 --> 00:48:15.225
GET TO MERCED QUICKER THAN THEY

00:48:15.292 --> 00:48:15.859
WOULD ON THE CONVENTIONAL RAIL.

00:48:15.926 --> 00:48:17.160
ACROSS THE PLATFORM. GET ON

00:48:17.227 --> 00:48:17.728
AMTRAK IF THEY WANT TO TAKE

00:48:17.794 --> 00:48:19.029
ACTION FOR ACE. IN GETTING

00:48:19.096 --> 00:48:19.496
EITHER THE BAY AREA OR

00:48:19.563 --> 00:48:21.298
SACRAMENTO. AS I. AS AN INTERIM

00:48:21.365 --> 00:48:21.932
MEASURE FOR AND BY THE WAY I'M

00:48:21.999 --> 00:48:23.400
NOT ASKING YOU THESE QUESTIONS

00:48:23.467 --> 00:48:25.202
TO BE ARGUMENTATIVE. OR TO SAY

00:48:25.269 --> 00:48:25.669
THAT THERE'S ANYTHING.

00:48:25.736 --> 00:48:27.237
NECESSARILY WRONG ABOUT THE

00:48:27.304 --> 00:48:29.406
APPROACH BUT I WANT TO MAKE

00:48:29.473 --> 00:48:31.041
SURE THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND

00:48:31.108 --> 00:48:31.708
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT AS WE

00:48:31.775 --> 00:48:33.076
MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS. WE ALL

00:48:33.143 --> 00:48:35.445

WE UNDERSTAND. WHAT THE

00:48:45.789 --> 00:48:47.090
EXPERIENCE IS GOING TO BE FOR

00:48:47.157 --> 00:48:49.359
THEM BECAUSE I'M FROM A REGION

00:48:49.426 --> 00:48:53.263
WHERE A LOT SOMETIMES. USE THE

00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:53.864
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IS NOT

00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:55.132
GOING IN THE DIRECTION WOULD

00:48:55.198 --> 00:48:55.766
LIKE GOING DOWN NOT UP. AND AS

00:48:55.832 --> 00:48:57.034
SOMEBODY WHO. YOU KNOW I GAVE

00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:59.236

THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. IF YOU

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:05.409

00:50:45.008 --> 00:50:45.509
LOT OF DISRUPTION. BUT THE

00:50:45.575 --> 00:50:47.444
SECONDARY ISSUE THAT IS DEALING

BETTER WAY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

THE NEEDS ARE AS YOU GO INTO A

00:51:01.258 --> 00:51:03.326
DENSE AREAS. AND COMMUNICATING.

00:51:03.393 --> 00:51:05.429
MAYBE BETTER THAN THE PREVIOUS

00:51:05.495 --> 00:51:07.297
REGIME. WITH ALL OF THE

00:51:07.364 --> 00:51:09.099
DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND CITIES

YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT HOW DO

00:51:11.201 --> 00:51:11.701
YOU MANAGE THAT SO THAT YOU

WHEN YOU GO TO THE SAN FERNANDO

00:51:15.906 --> 00:51:17.007

00:51:17.073 --> 00:51:19.709
SMALL CITY LIKE CITY OF SAN

00:51:19.776 --> 00:51:20.343
PRINT THAT THEY'RE GONNA LOSE

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:23.079
THEIR ENTIRE DOWNTOWN. THE HIGH

00:51:23.146 --> 00:51:23.613
SPEED RAIL HOW DO YOU WORK

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:27.484

00:51:27.551 --> 00:51:28.985
APPRECIATE THE QUESTION ALSO

00:51:29.052 --> 00:51:30.854
APPRECIATE YOUR POINT ABOUT-

00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:31.455
THIS IS A LARGE- STRATEGY OF

00:51:31.521 --> 00:51:34.891
GETTING PEOPLE. TO USE BOTH

00:51:34.958 --> 00:51:35.325
HIGH SPEED RAIL AND

FIVE YEARS OF WORKING IN

00:51:47.771 --> 00:51:48.839
TRANSPORTATION AND I THINK THE

00:51:48.905 --> 00:51:51.274
IDEA. OF CONNECTING CITIES OF

00:51:51.341 --> 00:51:52.976
CALIFORNIA. THROUGH ELECTRIFIED

00:51:53.043 --> 00:51:54.945
HIGH SPEED RAIL WILL ENHANCE

00:51:55.011 --> 00:51:57.514
LOCAL AND REGIONAL TRANSIT

00:51:57.581 --> 00:51:58.915
SERVICES WELL. SO I AM A

00:51:58.982 --> 00:52:00.851
PASSIONATE ABOUT THAT ON TO

ON THE BURBANK EXAMPLE. ONE OF

00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:07.824
THINGS THAT I'VE TRIED TO DO

00:52:07.891 --> 00:52:08.859
SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE IS WORK

00:52:08.925 --> 00:52:11.027
TOWARD BEING MORE SPECIFIC AND

00:52:11.094 --> 00:52:12.896
CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING-

00:52:12.963 --> 00:52:15.499
AND- THAT MANIFESTS ITSELF IN A

00:52:15.565 --> 00:52:17.234
COUPLE OF WAYS FOR A LONG TIME

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:19.202
BEFORE I GOT HERE. THE

00:52:19.269 --> 00:52:21.004
AUTHORITY HAD NOT- QUITE YET

00:52:21.071 --> 00:52:22.873
EVEN ADOPTED THIS PREFERRED

00:52:22.939 --> 00:52:24.941
ALTERNATIVES FOR SOME OF ITS-

00:52:25.008 --> 00:52:27.177
WORDS INTENDING TO GO IN SO IN

THE PREFERRED ALTERNATIVES FOR

00:52:29.679 --> 00:52:33.116
THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AREA.

00:52:33.183 --> 00:52:33.783
IN IN THE BAY AREA WE COMPLETED

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:35.218
THAT JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS

00:52:35.285 --> 00:52:37.187
AGO- BUT DOING THAT HELPS THAT

00:52:37.254 --> 00:52:39.155
ENHANCE THE COMMUNITY

00:52:39.222 --> 00:52:41.091
CONVERSATION. BECAUSE IT DID

00:52:41.157 --> 00:52:43.159
NOW ATTENDS THE FOCUS ON WHERE

00:52:43.226 --> 00:52:43.793
WE INTEND TO GO AS A PREFERRED

00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:46.897
ALTERNATIVE. AND IT HELPS AS A

00:52:46.963 --> 00:52:47.464

SITTING AND LISTENING- IT ON

00:53:23.199 --> 00:53:25.235
THE FRONT END OF THINGS AND NOT

00:53:25.302 --> 00:53:27.003
WAITING TILL THE END- DIRECT.

00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:28.939
WE HAVE SOME IN A PROBLEM IN

00:53:29.005 --> 00:53:29.506
TWO EXAMPLES I'D GIVE YOU A

00:53:29.573 --> 00:53:31.241
THAT ARE. IN OUR STRETCH

00:53:31.308 --> 00:53:33.410

IN THE TO HATCH PEAS AND

00:53:39.215 --> 00:53:39.616
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

00:53:39.683 --> 00:53:41.251
CONSTERNATION IS A BACK AND

00:53:41.318 --> 00:53:43.453
FORTH ABOUT- WHERE AND HOW THE

00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:45.055
TRAIN WILL GET AROUND. THAT

00:53:45.121 --> 00:53:47.724
SEGMENT WE DECIDED DELAYED

00:53:47.791 --> 00:53:49.225
THINGS FOR SIX MONTHS DOES HAVE

00:53:49.292 --> 00:53:50.994
CONSECRATED COOPER STATION WITH

00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:52.963
THAT ENTITY TO WORK THROUGH HOW

00:53:53.029 --> 00:53:55.265
WE WILL DO THAT. AND I THINK

00:53:55.332 --> 00:54:01.071
WE'VE MADE SIGNIFICANT.

00:54:01.137 --> 00:54:01.671
PROGRESS THE- US POLITICAL FOR

00:54:01.738 --> 00:54:07.577
THE. THE SECOND. OTHER ISSUE

00:54:07.644 --> 00:54:09.412
THAT WE WORK THROUGH WITH THE-

00:54:09.479 --> 00:54:11.181
ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS CAUGHT

00:54:11.247 --> 00:54:11.781
A PLACE CALLED. THE LAKE WITH

00:54:11.848 --> 00:54:12.349
HOW WE WILL GET THROUGH THE

00:54:12.415 --> 00:54:13.149
LAKE. RATHER THAN JUST MARCHING

00:54:13.216 --> 00:54:13.817
FORWARD NOT LISTENING IN HAVING

00:54:13.883 --> 00:54:15.318
A FIGHT AT THE END. BUT WE'RE

00:54:15.385 --> 00:54:15.885
ENGAGING EARLIER AND HAVING

00:54:15.952 --> 00:54:16.453
THESE CONVERSATIONS- ON THE

00:54:16.519 --> 00:54:17.020
FRONT END IN TRYING TO WORK

00:54:17.087 --> 00:54:17.654
THROUGH THESE ISSUES SO. PART

00:54:17.721 --> 00:54:18.188
OF IT IS TAKING THE TIME

00:54:18.254 --> 00:54:19.389
EARLIER FIRST OF ALL IT'S-

00:54:19.456 --> 00:54:21.157
BEING MORE SPECIFIC CLEAR.

00:54:21.224 --> 00:54:23.627
ABOUT WHAT OUR INTENTIONS ARE-

00:54:23.693 --> 00:54:25.228
IN IN THE END. UP TAKING THE

00:54:25.295 --> 00:54:26.896
TIME TO HAVE THE CONVERSATIONS.

00:54:26.963 --> 00:54:28.932
TO LISTEN TO THE COMMUNITIES

00:54:28.999 --> 00:54:29.466
AND FIGURE OUT WHERE WE

00:54:29.532 --> 00:54:32.936
DISAGREE. AND THEN WORK TOWARD

00:54:33.003 --> 00:54:35.105
UP SOME KIND OF A SOLUTION. AND

00:54:35.171 --> 00:54:37.007
SO. THAT'S THE APPROACH I'VE

00:54:37.073 --> 00:54:37.674
TRIED TO I'VE TRIED TO BRING TO

00:54:37.741 --> 00:54:39.275
THIS SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE. I

00:54:39.342 --> 00:54:40.977
THINK IT'S THE APPROACH THAT MY

00:54:41.044 --> 00:54:43.480
BOARD INSISTS ON- IN TERMS OF

00:54:43.546 --> 00:54:47.050
HAVING A BETTER- OUTREACH

00:54:47.117 --> 00:54:49.285
EFFORT AND COMMUNITY- RESPONSE

00:54:49.352 --> 00:54:51.221
EFFORT- IN SO THAT. IN SHORT

00:54:51.287 --> 00:54:53.223
THAT'S WHAT I'M WHAT I TRY TO

00:54:53.289 --> 00:54:55.291
DO. IT IN- AS THANK YOU AND

00:54:55.358 --> 00:54:57.160
I'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION

00:54:57.227 --> 00:54:57.761
BEFORE BUT YOU KNOW CERTAINLY

00:54:57.827 --> 00:54:59.295
WHEN IT COMES TO BURBANK

00:54:59.362 --> 00:55:01.297
AIRPORT- IT'S A MAJOR

00:55:01.364 --> 00:55:03.199
TRANSPORTATION HUB. BEING MAJOR

00:55:03.266 --> 00:55:07.570
REGIONAL AIRPORT. THERE'S ALSO

00:55:07.637 --> 00:55:08.071
TWO METROLINK TRAINS TO

00:55:08.138 --> 00:55:12.976
BUILDING A TERMINAL. AT SOME

00:55:13.043 --> 00:55:15.345
POINT YOU MAY BE BUILDING A

00:55:15.412 --> 00:55:15.945
TERMINAL THERE AS WELL AND IT

00:55:16.012 --> 00:55:16.513
WOULD JUST BE GREAT IF FOR

00:55:16.579 --> 00:55:17.280
PASSENGERS THEY HAVE A SEAMLESS

00:55:17.347 --> 00:55:17.881
EXPERIENCE FROM ONE OF THESE

00:55:17.947 --> 00:55:19.049
TRAVEL MODALITIES TOGETHER. I

00:55:19.115 --> 00:55:19.549
DON'T SEE THAT PLANNING

00:55:19.616 --> 00:55:20.917
HAPPENING QUITE HONESTLY I SEE

00:55:20.984 --> 00:55:22.819
THEM BUILDING A TERMINAL.

00:55:22.886 --> 00:55:23.420
WITHOUT ANY THOUGHT TO HOW IT

00:55:23.486 --> 00:55:25.088
CONNECTS WITH WHATEVER IF

00:55:25.155 --> 00:55:25.689
YOU'RE GONNA BUILD A TERMINAL.

00:55:25.755 --> 00:55:27.490
I KNOW IT'S FAR FROM THE FUTURE

00:55:27.557 --> 00:55:28.058
MAYBE IT HAPPENS MAYBE IT

00:55:28.124 --> 00:55:31.027
DOESN'T BUT I STILL DON'T SEE

00:55:31.094 --> 00:55:31.661
THAT KIND OF COORDINATION AND-

00:55:31.728 --> 00:55:33.196
THERE'S A LOT OF. APPOINTING OF

00:55:33.263 --> 00:55:35.131
THAT OTHER COUNTRIES AND THEIR

00:55:35.198 --> 00:55:37.333
EXPERIENCE WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:37.834
AND I DON'T SEE THE SAME

00:55:37.901 --> 00:55:41.204
ATTEMPT TO TIE. AIRPORT TO HIGH

00:55:41.271 --> 00:55:42.906
SPEED RAIL. THE WAY THAT WE'VE

00:55:42.972 --> 00:55:43.506
SEEN IT WORK EFFECTIVELY IN

00:55:43.573 --> 00:55:45.308
OTHER PLACES I STILL HAVE THE

00:55:45.375 --> 00:55:47.143
SORT OF NIGHTMARE. THAT THEY'RE

00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:47.744
GOING TO BUILD THEIR TERMINAL.

00:55:47.811 --> 00:55:49.079
ONE DAY YOU COME IN YOU BUILD

00:55:49.145 --> 00:55:49.713
YOUR TERMINAL AND PEOPLE HAVE

00:55:49.779 --> 00:55:51.347
TO WALK A HALF MILE TO GET FROM

00:55:51.414 --> 00:55:52.916
ONE TO THE OTHER OR SOMEBODY

00:55:52.982 --> 00:55:53.550
HAS TO BUILD SOME EXPENSIVE.

00:55:53.616 --> 00:55:55.251
THING TO BRING THEM BACK AND

00:55:55.318 --> 00:55:58.888
FORTH- AND I JUST HOPE THAT AS

00:55:58.955 --> 00:56:00.990
WE THINK ABOUT. REGIONAL

00:56:01.057 --> 00:56:03.493
TRANSPORTATION HUBS THAT WE

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:04.828
REALLY THINK OF IT THAT WAY AND

00:56:04.894 --> 00:56:07.030
GET OUT OF OUR SILOS AND WORK.

00:56:07.097 --> 00:56:09.232
TEMPTED AND WORK. IT FROM THE-

00:56:09.299 --> 00:56:11.601
VIEWPOINT OF A USER AND A GOOD

00:56:11.668 --> 00:56:13.269
USER EXPERIENCE AND HAVING

00:56:13.336 --> 00:56:15.138
SOMETHING THAT IS. A PLANNED IN

00:56:15.205 --> 00:56:17.107
ADVANCE SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE

00:56:17.173 --> 00:56:19.576
THE ADDITIONAL EXPENSE OF

00:56:19.642 --> 00:56:20.210
HAVING TO GO BACK AND RETROFIT

00:56:20.276 --> 00:56:22.979
AND BUILD TRAINS TO AIRPORTS

00:56:23.046 --> 00:56:23.546
LIKE WE'RE DOING IT LA ACTS

00:56:23.613 --> 00:56:24.948
AND- EVERYTHING ELSE- THE ONE

00:56:25.014 --> 00:56:27.383
WE JUST SAY THAT- RIGHT NOW I'M

00:56:27.450 --> 00:56:28.017
IT'S SORT OF THE MID POINT OF

00:56:28.084 --> 00:56:31.121
CONVERSATIONS WITH- THE BURBANK

00:56:31.187 --> 00:56:32.922
AIRPORT. THE CITY OF BURBANK IN

00:56:32.989 --> 00:56:35.058
THE FAA. ON EXACTLY HOW WE'D

00:56:35.125 --> 00:56:35.625
COME IN THERE AND WHEN AND-

00:56:35.692 --> 00:56:37.160
EVERYBODY'S GOT THEIR OWN

00:56:37.227 --> 00:56:39.028
ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENT- SO

00:56:39.095 --> 00:56:39.662
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

00:56:39.729 --> 00:56:41.231
TO MAKE THAT WORK- BUT- EVEN

00:56:41.297 --> 00:56:43.199
THE LEAD AT THE BURBANK AIRPORT

00:56:43.266 --> 00:56:45.301
SAID TO ME IN OUR MOST RECENT

00:56:45.368 --> 00:56:47.137
MEETING- HOW IMPORTANT WAS

00:56:47.203 --> 00:56:49.305
THAT- WE'RE MAKING A VERY

00:56:49.372 --> 00:56:51.074
EASIER FOR THE PASSENGERS TO

00:56:51.141 --> 00:56:53.109
YOU. KNOW GET THERE AND GET-

00:56:53.176 --> 00:56:54.944
FROM A TRAIN STATION TO THE

00:56:55.011 --> 00:56:57.580
TERMINAL- TOLD MILLIE FLY IN

00:56:57.647 --> 00:56:58.948
SO. OF A GUY CLEARLY- THAT'S

00:56:59.015 --> 00:57:00.984
SOMETHING WE WANT TO GET TO.

00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:02.886
THE QUESTION IS INTERESTS OR

00:57:02.952 --> 00:57:05.088
GETS TO A PROCESS ISSUE. HOW

00:57:05.155 --> 00:57:05.722
YOU DO IT THE BASS WHILE HAVING

00:57:05.789 --> 00:57:07.090
EVERYBODY MOVE. ON THE

00:57:07.157 --> 00:57:08.958
ENVIRONMENT REVIEW PROCESS AND

00:57:09.025 --> 00:57:11.294
SO THAT'S- CONVERSATIONS WERE

00:57:11.361 --> 00:57:11.895
ENGAGED IN. IN REAL TIME RIGHT

00:57:11.961 --> 00:57:19.702
NOW. AND I'M HAPPY TO MEET WITH

00:57:19.769 --> 00:57:20.336
YOU ON THAT GOING FOR IF I MAY

00:57:20.403 --> 00:57:22.972
JUST FOR ONE MOMENT. THE MAN I

00:57:23.039 --> 00:57:23.506
AM AWARE OF WHAT YOU WERE

00:57:23.573 --> 00:57:24.140
TALKING SO OUT EARLIER. WITH

00:57:24.207 --> 00:57:25.642
BURBANK THE INTENTION. WAS

00:57:25.708 --> 00:57:27.443
ISSUED TO THE ISSUE. MORE OR

00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:29.279
LESS TO FIND OUT WE WORK

00:57:29.345 --> 00:57:32.949
TOGETHER. AND GENERATE A

00:57:33.016 --> 00:57:33.516
TRANSPORTATION HUB THAT WAS

00:57:33.583 --> 00:57:34.984
REALLY IMPORTANT TO US. AND

00:57:35.051 --> 00:57:35.585
CLEARLY IMPORTANT TO BURBANK.

00:57:35.652 --> 00:57:36.886
THE CHALLENGE WAS A MESSAGE ON

00:57:36.953 --> 00:57:39.155
OUR SIDE WAS REALLY NOT VERY

00:57:39.222 --> 00:57:39.589
CLEAR. AND CERTAINLY

00:57:39.656 --> 00:57:41.224
MISHANDLED- I THINK THAT IS

00:57:41.291 --> 00:57:43.326
SOMETHING THAT- OVER THE YEARS

00:57:43.393 --> 00:57:47.030
WE'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT A

00:57:47.096 --> 00:57:49.199
INTERACTION WITH. THOSE P. IT

00:57:49.265 --> 00:57:49.766
WITH THOSE SAID STAKEHOLDERS

00:57:49.833 --> 00:57:51.301
THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH IN

00:57:51.367 --> 00:57:53.336
AROUND- THAT WAS A VERY

00:57:53.403 --> 00:57:55.004
UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE I REALLY

00:57:55.071 --> 00:57:59.142
DID SEE THE OPPORTUNITY. WITH

00:57:59.209 --> 00:57:59.642
WHAT WE COULD HAVE DONE

00:57:59.709 --> 00:58:00.243
TOGETHER WITH BURBANK AT THAT

00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:03.346
POINT. WELL AGAIN I'M NOT

00:58:03.413 --> 00:58:03.880
TRYING TO MAKE THIS ABOUT

00:58:03.947 --> 00:58:05.315
BURBANK I THINK THIS IS

00:58:05.381 --> 00:58:05.849
SOMETHING YOU NEED TO BE

00:58:05.915 --> 00:58:07.317
MINDFUL OF AND THE ENTIRE.

SECOND STUDY. WHICH WOULD LOOK

01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:13.256
AT THE A SIDE BY SIDE BY SIDE

01:03:13.322 --> 01:03:15.324

CALIFORNIA IN THE LA AREA. SO

01:03:24.934 --> 01:03:27.303
WE STARTED IN THE SUMMER TAKING

01:03:27.370 --> 01:03:33.309
A LOOK AT THAT ON SLIDE. FOR WE

01:03:33.376 --> 01:03:35.211
OUTLINED WHAT I JUST SAID

01:03:35.278 --> 01:03:35.845
VERBALLY BASICALLY IS WHAT THE

01:03:35.912 --> 01:03:37.847
SCORES WOULD WOULD LOOK AT THE

01:03:37.914 --> 01:03:41.250
SELL SIDE BY SIDE COMPARISON

01:03:41.317 --> 01:03:41.817
AND BEST WAY TO INVEST. FOUR

01:03:41.884 --> 01:03:46.989
EIGHT BILLION. SLIDE I'VE. HE

01:03:47.056 --> 01:03:48.991
START OUR QUALITY IF IT TALKS

01:03:49.058 --> 01:03:49.625
ABOUT QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS SO

01:03:49.692 --> 01:03:51.661
WE BROKE TO STUDY INTO TWO

01:03:51.727 --> 01:03:52.128
PHASES PHASE ONE IS A

01:03:52.195 --> 01:03:57.567
QUALITATIVE PHASE. SHOT TO THE

01:03:57.633 --> 01:03:59.502
STATE OF THE AIR SUCH AS- LÀ

01:03:59.569 --> 01:04:03.206
SOME OF THE TRAINING CALTRANS

01:04:03.272 --> 01:04:05.508
CAL STAR. AND WHAT REGIONAL

01:04:05.575 --> 01:04:07.543
COMMITTEE IN AND OUT. WELL AS

01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:17.386
AN- THE EIGHT. WE LOOKED AT.

01:04:17.453 --> 01:04:19.522
HOW HOW BEST THE MONEY THOSE IN

01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:21.824
THOSE AREAS AS WE GATHER DATE

01:04:21.891 --> 01:04:25.394
TO OPEN OPEN SKATE OR NUMBER

01:04:25.461 --> 01:04:27.630
ENDING UP OF WHAT THE PIECES IN

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:29.699
HOW WOULD YOU THE FUNDS THEY

01:04:29.765 --> 01:04:35.338
ARE CONSTRUCTION. AND IN ONE

01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:39.075
FILE. THEY'RE ALL OF MINES. AND

01:04:39.141 --> 01:04:42.979
WE JUST PERCENT WE HAVE. IS

01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:45.815
THAT WE FROM THERE AND SAW THE

01:04:45.881 --> 01:04:47.416
POLITICS OF THEIR EARLY

01:04:47.483 --> 01:04:49.285
INDICATOR OF HOW WE THINK THE

01:04:49.352 --> 01:04:51.020
QUANTITATIVE PHASE WILL GO IN

01:04:51.087 --> 01:04:51.621
THE QUANTITATIVE SPACE WILL

01:04:51.687 --> 01:04:52.221
DEEP DIVE THEN INTO RIDERSHIP

01:04:52.288 --> 01:04:53.122
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND

01:04:53.189 --> 01:04:53.689
CONGESTION RELIEF AND THOSE

01:04:53.756 --> 01:04:54.991
THREE QUARTERS AND WE'RE

01:04:55.057 --> 01:04:55.558
WORKING ON THAT NOW SO THE

01:04:55.625 --> 01:04:56.092
QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS WAS

01:04:56.158 --> 01:04:57.493
RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC I THINK

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.094

OF YOU THERE ARE THINK IT'S

01:16:47.903 --> 01:16:49.438
EASIER FOR US WAS FOR ME TO ASK

01:16:49.504 --> 01:16:51.073
QUESTIONS OF EACH YOU WHEN YOU

01:16:51.139 --> 01:16:53.208
SPEAK INSTEAD OF. BY THE TIME

01:16:53.275 --> 01:16:53.842
THEY GET DOWN THERE I WANT TO

REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID- I HAVE

01:16:57.079 --> 01:16:58.880
A QUESTION ABOUT IN THE CENTRAL

01:16:58.947 --> 01:17:01.083
VALLEY FULL BUILD SLIDE ABOUT

01:17:01.149 --> 01:17:03.085
THE MORE EFFICIENT COST PER

01:17:03.151 --> 01:17:05.153
MILE AN IMPROVED COST RECOVERY

01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:07.022
FROM FAIR REVENUES PARK SO IS

01:17:07.089 --> 01:17:10.959
THE IS PART OF YOUR ANALYSIS

01:17:11.026 --> 01:17:14.997
ABOUT- KIND OF THE OF THE- FULL

01:17:15.063 --> 01:17:21.470
BUILD. A NOW. I HAVE TO PUT UP

01:17:21.536 --> 01:17:22.004
THERE OKAY IT'S NOT THAT

01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:23.305
IMPORTANT THAT THE PUT IN THAT.

01:17:23.372 --> 01:17:25.407
THE FULL BUILD BEING THE SORT

01:17:25.474 --> 01:17:26.074
OF PREFERRED- SITUATION HERE IS

01:17:26.141 --> 01:17:28.944
THAT BASED ON. THE FINDINGS ARE

01:17:29.011 --> 01:17:30.879
BASED ON THE COST NOT

01:17:30.946 --> 01:17:31.446
INCREASING THEM THAT WHAT

01:17:31.513 --> 01:17:33.115
HAPPENS IF AS WE BUILD THE

01:17:33.181 --> 01:17:35.450
COSTS GO UP IF IT'S NOT EXACTLY

01:17:35.517 --> 01:17:36.885
WHAT WE THINK IT'S GOING TO BE

01:17:36.952 --> 01:17:38.987
AT THIS MOMENT IF. AS COSTS

01:17:39.054 --> 01:17:39.554
OFTEN DO ON LARGE PROJECTS

01:17:39.621 --> 01:17:41.256
THERE ARE COST OVERRUNS HOW

01:17:41.323 --> 01:17:43.025
DOES THAT CHANGE THE ANALYSIS.

01:17:43.091 --> 01:17:45.160
WHEN WE DID OUR ANALYSIS WE

01:17:45.227 --> 01:17:47.129
HAVE TO USE THE DATA THAT'S

01:17:47.195 --> 01:17:47.729
PRESENTED NOW THE JETTA COULD

01:17:47.796 --> 01:17:49.431
CHANGE FOR US ALL OBVIOUSLY IT

01:17:49.498 --> 01:17:51.166
HAS CHANGED HIS FOR THE PROJECT

01:17:51.233 --> 01:17:53.201
BUT- WE HAD TO KIND OF DRAW A

01:17:53.268 --> 01:17:55.337
LINE AND SAY OKAY THIS IS WHAT

01:17:55.404 --> 01:17:55.904
WE KNOW OTHERWISE WE START

01:17:55.971 --> 01:17:57.305
GETTING INTO MULTIPLE SAY

01:17:57.372 --> 01:17:57.839
UNDERSTAND THAT BUT LET'S

01:17:57.906 --> 01:17:59.474
ASSUME THAT THE COSTS GO UP.

01:17:59.541 --> 01:18:01.143
LET'S ASSUME THAT AS THEY HAVE

01:18:01.209 --> 01:18:01.777
FOR THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THIS

01:18:01.843 --> 01:18:03.445
PROJECT THE COSTS CONTINUE TO

01:18:03.512 --> 01:18:07.182
RISE. DOESN'T THAT THEN CHANGE

01:18:07.249 --> 01:18:07.682
YOUR BOTTOM LINE OF YOU

01:18:07.749 --> 01:18:09.251
DECIDING THAT THIS. AT ONE OF

01:18:09.317 --> 01:18:11.019
THE REASONS THAT THIS IS THE

01:18:11.086 --> 01:18:13.255
PREFERRED. OPTION BECAUSE OF

01:18:13.321 --> 01:18:17.092
THAT COST ANALYSIS IF THE COSTS

01:18:17.159 --> 01:18:19.194
GO UP. THAT MIGHT NOT MAKE YOU

01:18:19.261 --> 01:18:22.931
MIGHT CHANGE YOUR- YOUR-

01:18:22.998 --> 01:18:23.532
RECOMMENDATION OF THIS BEING

01:18:23.598 --> 01:18:25.100
THE PREFERRED- ALTERNATIVE

01:18:25.167 --> 01:18:27.502
CRACKED I THINK OF THE COSTS GO

01:18:27.569 --> 01:18:29.538
UP WE WOULD HAVE TO RE LOOK AT

01:18:29.604 --> 01:18:33.275
IT AND. RECALCULATED FOR SURE

01:18:33.341 --> 01:18:36.912
NOW MY OTHER QUESTION IS. YOU

01:18:36.978 --> 01:18:37.479
HAVE A LINE THAT SAYS EARLY

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:38.113
HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICES CREATE

01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:39.314
SIGNIFICANT VALUE. CAN YOU

01:18:39.381 --> 01:18:41.216
EXPLAIN WHY WHAT WHAT IS THE

01:18:41.283 --> 01:18:41.817
VALUE OF. QUALITATIVE A STAMP

01:18:41.883 --> 01:18:45.053
POINT WE'RE LOOKING AT. THE

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:45.754
VALUE OF PROVING THAT IT CAN BE

01:18:45.821 --> 01:18:47.456
DONE SO AS OF THE WOMEN I

01:18:47.522 --> 01:18:49.224
HIGHLY RAIL IT'S BEEN DONE ALL

01:18:49.291 --> 01:18:50.892
OVER THE WORLD I MEAN. NOBODY'S

01:18:50.959 --> 01:18:53.128
SAYING YOU CAN'T RUN A TRAIN AT

01:18:53.195 --> 01:18:53.728
TWO HUNDRED MILES IN THE STATE

01:18:53.795 --> 01:18:54.329
OF CALIFORNIA. BUT WHAT'S THE

01:18:54.396 --> 01:18:57.265
VALUE OF THAT. I THINK IT'S

01:18:57.332 --> 01:18:57.866
CHANGING CULTURE IT'S CHANGING

01:18:57.933 --> 01:18:59.167
THE MINDSET OF THE- OF THE-

01:18:59.234 --> 01:19:01.470
CITIZENS ALONG THE CORRIDOR BUT

01:19:01.536 --> 01:19:02.804
ALSO OF POTENTIAL INVESTORS.

01:19:02.871 --> 01:19:05.240
SEE I ACTUALLY DISAGREE WITH

01:19:05.307 --> 01:19:07.209
YOU I THINK THAT. YOU HAVE THAT

01:19:07.275 --> 01:19:07.809
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO PROVE

01:19:07.876 --> 01:19:11.079
VALUE. THAT'S RIDERSHIP. YES

01:19:11.146 --> 01:19:11.680
THE ONLY VALUE YOU HAVE IT'S

01:19:11.746 --> 01:19:12.948
NOT PROVING YOU CAN RUN A TRAIN

01:19:13.014 --> 01:19:13.582
A TWO HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR WE

01:19:13.648 --> 01:19:15.283
ALL KNOW YOU CAN BUILD A TRAIN

01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.917
THAT RUNS TWO HUNDRED MILES OUR

01:19:15.984 --> 01:19:17.486
IT'S OLD TECHNOLOGY. AROUND THE

01:19:17.552 --> 01:19:19.521
WORLD SORT OF A GIVEN. IN OTHER

01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:21.323
PARTS OF THE WORLD. SO WE KNOW

01:19:21.389 --> 01:19:23.391
WE CAN DO THAT- THE ONLY WAY

01:19:23.458 --> 01:19:25.260
YOU PRO VALUE. IS IF YOU

01:19:25.327 --> 01:19:26.895
INCREASE RIDERSHIP OTHERWISE

01:19:26.962 --> 01:19:27.529
IT'S ALL I MEAN WHAT IT WHAT

01:19:27.596 --> 01:19:29.364
ELSE WHAT'S THE OTHER PURPOSE.

01:19:29.431 --> 01:19:31.399
IT'S INCREASING RIDERSHIP AND

01:19:31.466 --> 01:19:33.368
SO I'M SORRY YOU I UNDERSTAND

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:33.935
THAT THIS HEARING IS NOT ON

01:19:34.002 --> 01:19:35.237
YOUR TWO YOU KNOW THIS THIS

01:19:35.303 --> 01:19:37.005
JUST POPPED UP YOU KNOW. YOU

01:19:37.072 --> 01:19:37.606
WEREN'T. DOING YOUR ANALYSIS

01:19:37.672 --> 01:19:39.374
FOR THIS. BUT WHAT ALL RIGHT

01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:41.576
WHAT WE NEED TO SEE IS THE

01:19:41.643 --> 01:19:43.111
RIDERSHIP ANALYSIS THAT'S- AND

01:19:43.178 --> 01:19:45.580
WHAT'S WHAT'S MISSING FROM ALL

01:19:45.647 --> 01:19:47.182
OF THESE. IS THAT YOU ARE. VERY

01:19:47.249 --> 01:19:49.050
DIFFERENT POPULATION CENTERS. A

01:19:49.117 --> 01:19:51.186
VERY DIFFERENT NEED FOR MASS

01:19:51.253 --> 01:19:51.720
TRANSIT AND ALL OF THESE

01:19:51.786 --> 01:19:53.722
DIFFERENT AREAS. AND EVEN WITH

01:19:53.788 --> 01:19:57.325
THE BEST. MOST CONVENIENT

01:19:57.392 --> 01:19:59.194
SERVICE IN THE WORLD YOU STILL

01:19:59.261 --> 01:20:01.096
HAVE A CAPPED RIDERSHIP BASED

01:20:01.163 --> 01:20:01.730
ON POPULATION WHERE PEOPLE ARE

01:20:01.796 --> 01:20:03.031
WORKING ON WHERE PEOPLE ARE

01:20:03.098 --> 01:20:05.233
GOING. SO WHAT WOULD I THINK

01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:07.235
WHAT WE NEED TO SEE TO HAVE ANY

01:20:07.302 --> 01:20:09.471
IDEA. OF WE'RE- WHERE WE

01:20:09.538 --> 01:20:14.943
DEMONSTRATE. BY ABILITY IS BY

01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:15.477
LOOKING AT THAT INCREASED

01:20:15.544 --> 01:20:17.245
RIDERSHIP BECAUSE IN MY MIND

01:20:17.312 --> 01:20:18.914
AND JUST TO CUT TO THE CHASE.

01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:21.082
ANYTHING THAT WE DO ANYWHERE

01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:21.750
ALONG THE SYSTEM ASSUMING THAT

01:20:21.816 --> 01:20:23.652
OUR GOAL IS TO BUILD SAN DIEGO

01:20:23.718 --> 01:20:25.320
TO SAN FRANCISCO WHICH BY THE

01:20:25.387 --> 01:20:27.289
WAY I WANT TO SEE I WANT TO SEE

01:20:27.355 --> 01:20:29.124
THAT HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM MY

01:20:29.191 --> 01:20:30.992
LIFETIME. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO

01:20:31.059 --> 01:20:32.928
GO SAN DIEGO TO SAN FRANCISCO

01:20:32.994 --> 01:20:33.595
BUT THE WAY WE GET THERE IS BY

01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:35.197
INCREASING RIDERSHIP KIND OF

01:20:35.263 --> 01:20:37.132
ANYWHERE ALONG THAT'S THAT

01:20:37.199 --> 01:20:37.699
SECTION TO WHERE YOU HAVE A

01:20:37.766 --> 01:20:39.301
LARGE POPULATION SAYING WE ARE

01:20:39.367 --> 01:20:43.071
NOW. WE'RE IN ON TRAINS WERE

01:20:43.138 --> 01:20:43.638
ALL TAKEN THE TRAIN TO WORK

01:20:43.705 --> 01:20:45.407
WE'RE ALL TAKING THE TRAIN WE

01:20:45.473 --> 01:20:45.974
GO AND CALIFORNIA WE DEMAND

01:20:46.041 --> 01:20:47.242
THAT YOU GIVE US THE FULL

01:20:47.309 --> 01:20:49.211
SYSTEM. RIGHT UNTIL YOU HAVE

01:20:49.277 --> 01:20:53.381
THE RIDERSHIP THAT STARTS TO

01:20:53.448 --> 01:20:54.015
DEMAND THAT PEOPLE WANT TO RIDE

01:20:54.082 --> 01:20:55.317
THE TRAIN. BECAUSE YOU'RE NEVER

01:20:55.383 --> 01:20:57.185
GOING TO GET THE WHOLE THING

01:20:57.252 --> 01:20:57.719
BUILT BECAUSE IT'S JUST

01:20:57.786 --> 01:20:59.154
THEORETICAL SO WE HAVE TO DO

01:20:59.221 --> 01:20:59.688
SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO

01:20:59.754 --> 01:21:00.288
INCREASE RIDERSHIP KIND OF IN

01:21:00.355 --> 01:21:03.491
REAL TIME. AND SO THAT TO ME IS

01:21:03.558 --> 01:21:06.962
WHAT DEMONSTRATES. THE PROJECT.

01:21:07.028 --> 01:21:08.997
NOT THAT WE CAN RUN A TRAIN A

01:21:09.064 --> 01:21:09.531
TWO HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR

01:21:09.598 --> 01:21:10.165
RUNNING A TRAIN AND TWO HUNDRED

01:21:10.232 --> 01:21:11.333
MILES AN HOUR THAT NO ONE

01:21:11.399 --> 01:21:11.900
TAKES. DOES THE OPPOSITE OF

01:21:11.967 --> 01:21:15.036
WHAT WE WANT. RIGHT IF YOU

01:21:15.103 --> 01:21:15.637
REALLY WANT TO GET INVESTMENT

01:21:15.704 --> 01:21:17.539
YOU HAVE TO SHOW THE PEOPLE CAN

01:21:17.606 --> 01:21:19.107
BUY THE TICKETS. SO THAT'S WHAT

01:21:19.174 --> 01:21:20.842
WE NEED TO SEE IS WHERE DO WE

01:21:20.909 --> 01:21:21.443
WHAT WHAT INVESTMENTS DO WE

01:21:21.509 --> 01:21:23.612
MAKE. WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:21:23.678 --> 01:21:25.213
DOLLARS. THAT INCREASE

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:27.549
RIDERSHIP THE MOST. ALONG THAT

01:21:27.616 --> 01:21:29.117
SYSTEM ANYWHERE IN THAT SYSTEM.

01:21:29.184 --> 01:21:31.353
THAT SHOWS AN INVESTOR THE

01:21:31.419 --> 01:21:31.886
PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO BUY

01:21:31.953 --> 01:21:35.156
TICKETS ON A TRAIN. SO THAT'S

01:21:35.223 --> 01:21:36.925
MY POINT AND THAT'S WHAT WE

01:21:36.992 --> 01:21:37.559
NEED TO SEE IN YOUR ANALYSIS I

01:21:37.626 --> 01:21:39.494
THINK TO REALLY. TOOK YOU CAN'T

01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:40.962
HAVE A FINDING YOU CAN'T HAVE A

01:21:41.029 --> 01:21:43.098
PRELIMINARY FINDING ABOUT WHERE

01:21:43.164 --> 01:21:43.698
TO SPEND THIS MONEY UNTIL YOU

01:21:43.765 --> 01:21:44.966
KNOW WE'RE RIDERSHIP. CAN BE

01:21:45.033 --> 01:21:47.002
INCREASED THE MOST. SO THE FACT

01:21:47.068 --> 01:21:47.502
THAT YOU HAVE BEEN OF A

01:21:47.569 --> 01:21:49.037
PRELIMINARY FACT FINDING THAT

01:21:49.104 --> 01:21:51.239
HAS NOTHING ON RIDERSHIP SHOWS

01:21:51.306 --> 01:21:51.773
ME THAT. YOU DON'T HAVE A

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.241
FINDING. I THINK THE QUESTION

01:21:53.308 --> 01:21:55.710
IS WHICH HOW DO WE GET TO HIGH

01:21:55.777 --> 01:21:57.178
SPEED RAIL. THE FASTEST IN THE

01:21:57.245 --> 01:21:59.180
STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHAT'S THE

01:21:59.247 --> 01:21:59.748
MISSION OF CALIFORNIA HIGH

01:21:59.814 --> 01:22:00.949
SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. IS OUR

01:22:01.016 --> 01:22:01.516
STANDING AS THAT THE MISSION

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:03.618
THIS IS TO PROVIDE A HIGH SPEED

01:22:03.685 --> 01:22:05.387
RAIL SERVICE BETWEEN- IN OUR

01:22:05.453 --> 01:22:09.190
PHASE ONE. OR THE VALLEY TO

01:22:09.257 --> 01:22:09.791
VALLEY. BAKERSFIELD AND SAND.

01:22:09.858 --> 01:22:11.293
SEVERANCE OKAY- THAT'S WHAT

01:22:11.359 --> 01:22:13.261
WE'RE FOCUSED ON SO WE'RE

01:22:13.328 --> 01:22:14.929
LOOKING AT WITHIN THAT CONTEXT

01:22:14.996 --> 01:22:15.463
IF YOU HAVE FOR THE MONEY

01:22:15.530 --> 01:22:17.565
AVAILABLE AND YOU CAN MOVE IT

01:22:17.632 --> 01:22:18.199
ANYWHERE WITHIN THAT VALLEY TO

01:22:18.266 --> 01:22:19.334
VALLEY LINE OR EVEN THE PHASE

01:22:19.401 --> 01:22:21.436
ONE LINE. WHAT'S THE BEST PLACE

01:22:21.503 --> 01:22:21.970
TO HELP YOU ACHIEVE YOUR

01:22:22.037 --> 01:22:23.571
MISSION AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:22:23.638 --> 01:22:24.172
LOOKING AT AND I WOULD SAY ONE

01:22:24.239 --> 01:22:25.407
MORE THING QUICKLY LOUDEST. AND

01:22:25.473 --> 01:22:27.275
THE QANTAS IN A QUANTITATIVE

01:22:27.342 --> 01:22:29.244
PHASE WE WILL GET INTO THE

01:22:29.311 --> 01:22:29.811
RIDERSHIP NUMBERS AND BILL

01:22:29.878 --> 01:22:30.912
WOULD PROVIDE THOSE TWENTY. I

01:22:30.979 --> 01:22:33.281
HAVE THAT. I THINK SEE YOU'RE

01:22:33.348 --> 01:22:36.885
THINKING OF IT. AS AN ENGINEER.

01:22:36.951 --> 01:22:37.485
IS HOW DO WE BUILD THE FASTEST

01:22:37.552 --> 01:22:41.423
TRAIN. THEN THE FACETS AMOUNT

01:22:41.489 --> 01:22:41.956
OF TIME RIGHT THAT'S WHAT

01:22:42.023 --> 01:22:42.524
ENGINEER WOULD SAY HOW DO WE

01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:43.091
TAKE THE MONEY WE HAVE AND

01:22:43.158 --> 01:22:45.060
BUILD A TRAIN THAT GOES REALLY

01:22:45.126 --> 01:22:47.128
FAST FOR THE MOST DISTANCE. AS

01:22:47.195 --> 01:22:49.130
A POLITICIAN I SAY HOW DO I

01:22:49.197 --> 01:22:50.999
MAKE A TRAIN THAT GETS MORE

01:22:51.066 --> 01:22:51.599
PEOPLE ONTO IT SO THAT I CAN

01:22:51.666 --> 01:22:53.468
SHOW MY COLLEAGUES IN THE

01:22:53.535 --> 01:22:54.069
LEGISLATURE THEY SHOULD INVEST

01:22:54.135 --> 01:22:57.205
MORE MONEY IN TRAINS. I THINK

01:22:57.272 --> 01:22:57.706
IT'S A DIFFERENT WAY OF

01:22:57.772 --> 01:22:59.307
THINKING ABOUT IT AND WHEN I

01:22:59.374 --> 01:23:01.209
HEAR DEMONSTRATING BY ABILITY

01:23:01.276 --> 01:23:03.144
IT'S DEMONSTRATING THAT I CAN

01:23:03.211 --> 01:23:05.246
GET A LOT OF PEOPLE THE RIGHT

01:23:05.313 --> 01:23:05.847
NOW DRIVING TO DECIDE INSTEAD

01:23:05.914 --> 01:23:09.050
TO TAKE THE TRAIN. SO JUST

01:23:09.117 --> 01:23:09.617
WANTED TO SAY THAT I THINK

01:23:09.684 --> 01:23:10.251
THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT WAYS OF

01:23:10.318 --> 01:23:11.386
DIAMOND OF VIABILITY MEANS HERE

01:23:11.453 --> 01:23:13.288
AND I THINK WE NEED TO BE CLEAR

01:23:13.355 --> 01:23:15.023
ABOUT THAT IS THE ONE THAT IS

01:23:15.090 --> 01:23:17.092
THE EASIEST TRAINED A BILL. IN

01:23:17.158 --> 01:23:18.960
THE FASTEST MAN OF TIME AND

01:23:19.027 --> 01:23:19.561
THERE'S THE ONE WHO ACTUALLY

01:23:19.627 --> 01:23:20.128
GETS PEOPLE TO CHANGE THEIR

01:23:20.195 --> 01:23:23.031
BEHAVIOR AND I DON'T THINK YOU

01:23:23.098 --> 01:23:23.665
CHANGE CULTURE BY DEMONSTRATING

01:23:23.732 --> 01:23:25.100
YOU CAN RUN A FAST TRAIN I

01:23:25.166 --> 01:23:25.700
THANK YOU CHANGE CULTURE BY

01:23:25.767 --> 01:23:26.968
GIVING PEOPLE WHO NEED TO GET

01:23:27.035 --> 01:23:29.037
SOMEWHERE A WAY TO GET THERE

01:23:29.104 --> 01:23:29.537
QUICKLY AND THAT'S MORE

01:23:29.604 --> 01:23:37.245
CONVENIENT THAN DRIVING. OKAY.

01:23:37.312 --> 01:23:37.846
THANK YOU IF I MAY JUST AS A

01:23:37.912 --> 01:23:41.082
COUNTERPOINT- AS WE PASSED PROP

01:23:41.149 --> 01:23:41.549
NAY THERE ARE CERTAIN

01:23:41.616 --> 01:23:43.051
REQUIREMENTS THAT NEED TO BE

01:23:43.118 --> 01:23:45.253
MATT AND SO I WOULD JUST TO

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:47.522
INSURE THAT WE ARE TRYING TO

01:23:47.589 --> 01:23:48.123
INITIATE HIGH SPEED RAIL AS

01:23:48.189 --> 01:23:49.257
SOON AS POSSIBLE AS THAT WAS

01:23:49.324 --> 01:23:51.292
THE DIRECTION OF VOTERS GAVE TO

01:23:51.359 --> 01:23:53.061
US AND IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY

01:23:53.128 --> 01:23:55.330
TO TAXPAYERS WITHOUT I'D LIKE

01:23:55.397 --> 01:23:55.897
TO NOW TRANSITION TO. DANNY

01:23:55.964 --> 01:24:01.403
CARD. THANK YOU MISTER

01:24:01.469 --> 01:24:03.171
CHAIRMAN- SO MANY QUESTIONS

01:24:03.238 --> 01:24:05.373
RATE BUT I'M GOING TO START

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:09.043
WITH THE WRITTEN STATEMENTS SO.

01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.644
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR INVITING

01:24:09.711 --> 01:24:11.679
ME. TO TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE

01:24:11.746 --> 01:24:15.116
HAS BEEN REAL OVERSIGHT HEARING.

01:24:15.183 --> 01:24:16.951
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NUMEROUS

01:24:17.018 --> 01:24:19.020
COMPLEX QUESTIONS AND ISSUES

01:24:19.087 --> 01:24:19.621
THAT THE SERVICE QUESTION AT

01:24:19.687 --> 01:24:20.855
THE STATE LEGISLATIVE LEVEL-

01:24:20.922 --> 01:24:23.224
THE PROBLEM THAT I AM SEEING AS

01:24:23.291 --> 01:24:25.326
HOW THIS DISCUSSION IS BEING

01:24:25.393 --> 01:24:27.262
FRAMED- AND IT'S VERY MUCH AN

01:24:27.328 --> 01:24:29.197
US VERSUS THEM KIND OF

01:24:29.264 --> 01:24:31.199
CONVERSATION ALL OR NOTHING IN

01:24:31.266 --> 01:24:33.435
OR OUT. AND I WANT TO START BY

01:24:33.501 --> 01:24:35.403
SAYING I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED

01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:37.205
IN THE RECENT FRESNO BEE

01:24:37.272 --> 01:24:37.806
EDITORIAL REGARDING HIGH SPEED

01:24:37.872 --> 01:24:41.443
RAIL I'M GONNA QUOTE THAT

01:24:41.509 --> 01:24:43.111
EDITORIAL SINGLE LARGE BRIDGES

01:24:43.178 --> 01:24:45.013
AND OTHER STRUCTURES THAT ARE

01:24:45.079 --> 01:24:45.647
TO CARRY THE HIGH SPEED TRAINS

01:24:45.713 --> 01:24:47.315
ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION HERE.

01:24:47.382 --> 01:24:49.784
AND ONE FEAR HAS BEEN THAT IF

01:24:49.851 --> 01:24:51.019
THE PROJECT WHEN FINISHED.

01:24:51.085 --> 01:24:53.321
THOSE STRUCTURES WOULD STAND

01:24:53.388 --> 01:24:55.089
OUT AS THE STONEHENGE LIKE

01:24:55.156 --> 01:24:55.690
MONUMENT TO THE STATE UTILITY

01:24:55.757 --> 01:24:58.993
ON THE BULLET TRAIN. I WAS

01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:01.296
APPOINTED TO THE HIGH SPEED

01:25:01.362 --> 01:25:01.863
RAIL- BOARD IN TWO THOUSAND

01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:05.433
FIFTEEN BY THE SPEAKER. AND NO

01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:07.135
DISCUSSION HAS EVER TAKEN

01:25:07.202 --> 01:25:09.370
PLACE. IN PUBLIC OR CLOSED

01:25:09.437 --> 01:25:11.239
SESSION AND I PER HEARD ANY

01:25:11.306 --> 01:25:14.976
BOARD MEMBER PAST OR PRESENT

01:25:15.043 --> 01:25:15.577
MENTION THE IDEA OF ABANDONING

01:25:15.643 --> 01:25:17.245
THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THOSE

01:25:17.312 --> 01:25:19.180
FRAMING THE CONVERSATION IN

01:25:19.247 --> 01:25:21.449
THIS WAY ARE ACTING RESPONSIBLY

01:25:21.516 --> 01:25:21.950
IN MY MIND AND DOING A

01:25:22.016 --> 01:25:25.253
DISSERVICE TO THE FUTURE OF THE

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:25.854
HIGH SPEED RAIL IN THE VALLEY

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:28.857
AND IN CALIFORNIA. IN FACT

01:25:28.923 --> 01:25:29.457
ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF THE

01:25:29.524 --> 01:25:31.259
HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY IS

01:25:31.326 --> 01:25:33.394
REQUIRED BY STATUTE. TO BUILD

01:25:33.461 --> 01:25:34.963
QUOTE USABLE SEGMENTS. THAT

01:25:35.029 --> 01:25:37.131
WILL BENEFIT LOCAL TRANSIT

01:25:37.198 --> 01:25:37.732
SYSTEMS IF WE FAIL TO COMPLETE

01:25:37.799 --> 01:25:41.402
OUR PROJECT. I HOPE THIS

01:25:41.469 --> 01:25:43.137
HEARING WILL HELP REFRAIN THAT

01:25:43.204 --> 01:25:43.705
CONVERSATION SO REAL OPTIONS

01:25:43.771 --> 01:25:45.340
CAN BE DISCUSSED. LET ME KNOW

01:25:45.406 --> 01:25:48.977
HOWEVER THERE HAS BEEN REPEATED

01:25:49.043 --> 01:25:51.145
MENTION AND CONCERNED ABOUT

01:25:51.212 --> 01:25:51.679
COMPLETING THE BASIC CIVIL

01:25:51.746 --> 01:25:55.083
INFRASTRUCTURE TRACK SYSTEMS OF

01:25:55.149 --> 01:25:57.352
THE ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILE

01:25:57.418 --> 01:25:59.187
CENTRAL VALLEY CORRIDOR BY THE

01:25:59.254 --> 01:26:00.955
TWENTY TWENTY TWO DEADLINE. AS

01:26:01.022 --> 01:26:03.057
REQUIRED UNDER THE OUR

01:26:03.124 --> 01:26:04.993
AGREEMENT THAT HAS BEEN

01:26:05.059 --> 01:26:05.527
DISCUSSED QUITE A BIT. SO

01:26:05.593 --> 01:26:09.497
MOVING ON. IN A LEGISLATIVE

01:26:09.564 --> 01:26:11.232
HEARING IN TWO THOUSAND AND

01:26:11.299 --> 01:26:11.766
EIGHTEEN SENATOR GALGIANI

01:26:11.833 --> 01:26:13.434
POINTED OUT THAT ONE OF THE

01:26:13.501 --> 01:26:15.103
REASONS WE WERE ABLE TO GET

01:26:15.169 --> 01:26:17.071
HAPPEN TRADE FUNDING IS BECAUSE

01:26:17.138 --> 01:26:19.307
OF AGREEMENTS WE MADE TO BUILD

01:26:19.374 --> 01:26:21.109
CONNECTED SYSTEMS THAT SERVE

01:26:21.175 --> 01:26:21.709
LOCAL AREAS AS WELL AS ACROSS

01:26:21.776 --> 01:26:25.380
THE ENTIRE STATE. BRIAN KELLY-

01:26:25.446 --> 01:26:27.282
HIGH SPEED RAIL STE HE AT THIS

01:26:27.348 --> 01:26:31.286
TIME- AND- I'M THE SAYS AT THE

01:26:31.352 --> 01:26:33.021
SAME LEGISLATIVE HEARING AND

01:26:33.087 --> 01:26:34.789
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. OUR GOAL

01:26:34.856 --> 01:26:37.492
HE SAID OUR GOAL IS TO PROVIDE

01:26:37.559 --> 01:26:37.959
MOBILITY AND MAXIMIZE

01:26:38.026 --> 01:26:39.193
CONNECTIVITY FOR CALIFORNIANS.

01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:41.262
WHAT EVER IT TAKES SO THAT THE

01:26:41.329 --> 01:26:42.897
PUBLIC CAN START RECEIVING

01:26:42.964 --> 01:26:43.398
BENEFITS FROM THE SYSTEM

01:26:43.464 --> 01:26:47.168
EARLIER. RATHER THAN LATER.

01:26:47.235 --> 01:26:47.702
THAT'S THE DISCUSSION I'M

01:26:47.769 --> 01:26:49.137
INTERESTED IN PURSUING. THE

01:26:49.203 --> 01:26:51.172
HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT IS IN

01:26:51.239 --> 01:26:52.974
THE PROCESS OF PROVIDING A

01:26:53.041 --> 01:26:53.675
VASTLY IMPROVED RAIL CARD OR IN

01:26:53.741 --> 01:26:56.878
THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THAT MEANS

01:26:56.945 --> 01:26:59.113
NEW DEDICATED TRACK NO LONGER

01:26:59.180 --> 01:26:59.681
SHARING TRACKS DESIGNED FOR

01:26:59.747 --> 01:27:01.049
FREIGHT TRAINS THAT MEANS

01:27:01.115 --> 01:27:03.084
SEPARATE STRAIGHTER AND FASTER

01:27:03.151 --> 01:27:05.119
AND MORE FREQUENT PASSENGER

01:27:05.186 --> 01:27:06.888
TRAINS. THAT IS NOT IN DISPUTE.

01:27:06.955 --> 01:27:09.357
THE QUESTION THAT IS NOT BEING

01:27:09.424 --> 01:27:13.094
ADDRESSED IS SIMPLY THIS. IS IT

01:27:13.161 --> 01:27:13.661
BETTER TO RIDE A ONE HUNDRED

01:27:13.728 --> 01:27:15.096
SEVENTY MILE PER HOUR TRAIN

01:27:15.163 --> 01:27:16.998
FROM BAKERSFIELD TUMOR SAID.

01:27:17.065 --> 01:27:19.033
BUT THEN HAVE TO GET OFF AND

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:20.902
WAIT FOR A DIFFERENT TRAIN. AND

01:27:20.969 --> 01:27:23.037
I MIGHT ADD CAPABLE OF ONE

01:27:23.104 --> 01:27:23.638
HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILES AN

01:27:23.705 --> 01:27:25.273
HOUR. IF YOUR DESTINATION IS

01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:28.776
SAN JOSE OR SACRAMENTO. THE UP.

01:27:28.843 --> 01:27:29.410
THE ANNOUNCES THAT YOU'VE SEEN

01:27:29.477 --> 01:27:31.412
BEFORE YOU IS BASED ON EXISTING

01:27:31.479 --> 01:27:33.147
CONDITION NOT ON UPGRADING AN

01:27:33.214 --> 01:27:37.085
EXISTING- TRAIN NINE ELECTRIFY

01:27:37.151 --> 01:27:37.685
TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILES

01:27:37.752 --> 01:27:39.354
AN HOUR THAT IS THE ANALYSIS

01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:39.954
THAT I HAVE NOT SEEN AND HAVE

01:27:40.021 --> 01:27:43.524
NOT. BEEN COMPARED. OR IS IT

01:27:43.591 --> 01:27:45.193
BETTER TO HAVE A ONE SEAT RIDE

01:27:45.259 --> 01:27:45.793
THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY

01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:49.030
FROM BAKERSFIELD TO MERCED.

01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:51.199
THEN ON TO SAN JOSE OR

01:27:51.265 --> 01:27:52.900
SACRAMENTO ON A ONE HUNDRED AND

01:27:52.967 --> 01:27:53.468
TWENTY FIVE MILES. PER HOUR

01:27:53.534 --> 01:27:56.938
TRAIN- THAT GOES TO THE

01:27:57.005 --> 01:27:59.173
RIDERSHIP QUESTION. I'VE ASK

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:00.975
PEOPLE THAT QUESTION MANY TIMES.

01:28:01.042 --> 01:28:03.277
UNLESS THERE IS A DRAMATIC

01:28:03.344 --> 01:28:05.046
DIFFERENCE IN TIME AND- I MIGHT

01:28:05.113 --> 01:28:06.781
QUESTION THAT DIFFERENCE

01:28:06.848 --> 01:28:09.283
BETWEEN- BAKERSFIELD AND MERCED

01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:11.252
IF IT'S A HUNDRED TWENTY MILE

01:28:11.319 --> 01:28:13.154
PER HOUR ON TWENTY FIVE MILE

01:28:13.221 --> 01:28:13.755
PER HOUR. LOW EMISSION HIGH

01:28:13.821 --> 01:28:17.158
SPEED DIESEL VERSUS A HUNDRED

01:28:17.225 --> 01:28:17.725
SEVENTY MILE AN HOUR TRAIN

01:28:17.792 --> 01:28:21.029
THAT'S A DIFFERENT COMPARISON.

01:28:21.095 --> 01:28:21.629
BUT ASSUMING THERE IS NOT A

01:28:21.696 --> 01:28:23.498
DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE IN TIME THE

01:28:23.564 --> 01:28:25.333
ONE SEAT RIDE IS ALWAYS THE

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:27.235
ANSWER ALWAYS. BUSINESS

01:28:27.301 --> 01:28:29.370
TRAVELERS PREFER THE SCHEDULING

01:28:29.437 --> 01:28:31.072
CERTAINTY GETTING TO THEIR

01:28:31.139 --> 01:28:33.408
APPOINTMENTS ON TIME. BECAUSE

01:28:33.474 --> 01:28:33.975
THERE'S A SCHEDULE ON ONE

01:28:34.042 --> 01:28:35.009
TRAINED IT'LL HAVE TO GET OFTEN

01:28:35.076 --> 01:28:37.045
CHANGE IN THE CONVENIENCE OF A

01:28:37.111 --> 01:28:37.645
ONE SEAT RIGHT SO THEY CAN GET

01:28:37.712 --> 01:28:39.147
SOME WORK DONE OR TAKE A NAP.

01:28:39.213 --> 01:28:41.549
FAMILIES ARE FAR MORE CONCERNED

01:28:41.616 --> 01:28:43.217
ABOUT THE SAFETY COMFORT AND

01:28:43.284 --> 01:28:45.019
CONVENIENCE OF MOVING THEIR

01:28:45.086 --> 01:28:46.788
CHILDREN ON A ONE SEAT RIDE-

01:28:46.854 --> 01:28:49.023
YOU JUST HEARD HURTING CHILDREN

01:28:49.090 --> 01:28:49.624
AROUND THE NAY- TRAIN STATION

01:28:49.691 --> 01:28:51.292
CAN BE PRETTY COMPLICATED EVEN

01:28:51.359 --> 01:28:52.994
IF IT IS A GOOD TIGHT-

01:28:53.061 --> 01:28:55.129
CONNECTION. A CASUAL TRAVELERS

01:28:55.196 --> 01:28:57.265
DEPEND ON ARRIVAL CERTAINTY SO

01:28:57.331 --> 01:28:58.966
THEY CAN BE PICKED UP. OR BE ON

01:28:59.033 --> 01:29:01.169
TIME FOR THE EVENTS THEY'RE

01:29:01.235 --> 01:29:01.602
TRAVELING TO MUSIC

01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:03.271
ENTERTAINMENT IT CETERA. SHORT

01:29:03.337 --> 01:29:05.073
OF CAREFULLY CAREFULLY

01:29:05.139 --> 01:29:07.308
COORDINATED INTER AGENCY AGENCY

01:29:07.375 --> 01:29:09.277
SCHEDULING. IT'S VERY POSSIBLE.

01:29:09.343 --> 01:29:11.379
THE TIME SAVED ON A HIGH SPEED

01:29:11.446 --> 01:29:13.281
TRAIN CAN EASILY BE LOST OR

01:29:13.347 --> 01:29:14.916
MADE WORSE BY TRANSFER

01:29:14.982 --> 01:29:17.185
TRANSFERS EVEN SMOOVE

01:29:17.251 --> 01:29:19.220
TRANSFERS. NEVER MIND THE

01:29:19.287 --> 01:29:20.822
INCONVENIENCE. WHAT A TRAVELER

01:29:20.888 --> 01:29:23.191
FROM FRESNO. AND I'M GOING TO.

01:29:23.257 --> 01:29:23.658
MAKE AN ESTIMATE OR A

01:29:23.725 --> 01:29:25.460
GUESSTIMATE WHO SAVE TWENTY TO

01:29:25.526 --> 01:29:27.028
THIRTY MINUTES ON A HIGH SPEED

01:29:27.095 --> 01:29:29.130
TRAIN AS COMPARED TO A HIGH

01:29:29.197 --> 01:29:31.566
SPEED DIESEL AT A HUNDRED AND

01:29:31.632 --> 01:29:32.200
TWENTY MILES AN HOUR AND TWENTY

01:29:32.266 --> 01:29:35.103
FIVE MILES AN HOUR. WITH A

01:29:35.169 --> 01:29:35.737
BENEFIT IF THEY HAD TO TRANSFER

01:29:35.803 --> 01:29:37.171
IN ORDER TO TRAVEL ANY FURTHER.

01:29:37.238 --> 01:29:39.173
VIRTUALLY EVERY RAIL INDUSTRY

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:39.841
PERSON I HAVE EVER SPOKEN WITH

01:29:39.907 --> 01:29:41.442
BELIEVES THAT WITHIN A

01:29:41.509 --> 01:29:43.077
REASONABLY COMPETITIVE SYSTEM A

01:29:43.144 --> 01:29:45.379
WANTS TO EAT RIDE IS THE MOST

01:29:45.446 --> 01:29:47.181
SIGNIFICANT WAY TO BUILD

01:29:47.248 --> 01:29:49.317
RIDERSHIP GOING TO ASSEMBLY

01:29:49.383 --> 01:29:51.052
WOMAN. FRIEDMAN'S POINT. CAN

01:29:51.119 --> 01:29:53.454
THE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE

01:29:53.521 --> 01:29:55.123
MILE PER HOUR ONE SHEET RIGHT

01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:57.191
PROGRAM BE BUILT AT LEAST

01:29:57.258 --> 01:29:59.193
SEVERAL YEARS SOONER THAN THE

01:29:59.260 --> 01:29:59.794
HUNDRED SEVENTY MILE PER HOUR

01:29:59.861 --> 01:30:00.995
HIGH SPEED RAIL TRAIN. THE

01:30:01.062 --> 01:30:03.331
ANSWER'S YES WELL THE ONE SEAT

01:30:03.397 --> 01:30:05.266
RIDE PROGRAM BE DONE BILLIONS

01:30:05.333 --> 01:30:07.001
OF DOLLARS CHEAPER THAN THE

01:30:07.068 --> 01:30:09.270
ELECTRIC TRAIN. THE TWO

01:30:09.337 --> 01:30:09.804
THOUSAND NINETEEN PROJECT

01:30:09.871 --> 01:30:11.205
UPDATE REPORT INDICATES THERE

01:30:11.272 --> 01:30:15.076
WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS.

01:30:15.143 --> 01:30:15.676
WOULD BE SMARTER TO WAIT TO

01:30:15.743 --> 01:30:17.345
FIND ELECTRIFICATION AND

01:30:17.411 --> 01:30:19.313
PURCHASE OF HIGH SPEED TRAINS

01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:20.982
UNTIL THEY ARE ACTUALLY NEEDED

01:30:21.048 --> 01:30:23.217
FOR A TRUE ONE SEAT RIDE

01:30:23.284 --> 01:30:23.785
THROUGH A TUNNEL TO THE BAY

01:30:23.851 --> 01:30:27.088
AREA. I BELIEVE WE NEED TO HAVE

01:30:27.155 --> 01:30:27.655
THAT DISCUSSION AND I'M GLAD

01:30:27.722 --> 01:30:29.157
WE'RE HERE HAVING IT ACTUALLY.

01:30:29.223 --> 01:30:30.925
THE QUESTION BECOMES WHICH

01:30:30.992 --> 01:30:33.194
BUILDING BLOCKS CAN THE HIGH

01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:35.096
SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY FOCUS ON

01:30:35.163 --> 01:30:35.663
TO ADVANCE THE GOALS OF THE

01:30:35.730 --> 01:30:39.167
PROGRAM. THEY ARE CONGESTION

01:30:39.233 --> 01:30:39.700
RELIEF AND INCREASED RAIL

01:30:39.767 --> 01:30:43.471
RIDERSHIP. BY THE WAY THERE WAS

01:30:43.538 --> 01:30:44.038
SIGNIFICANT DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:30:44.105 --> 01:30:49.210
THE RIDERSHIP. STATEMENTS MADE

01:30:49.277 --> 01:30:49.811
EARLIER- WE DIDN'T GET INTO

01:30:49.877 --> 01:30:51.445
THEM HERE BUT I HAVE

01:30:51.512 --> 01:30:53.247
INCREMENTAL VERSUS SIGNIFICAN

01:30:53.314 --> 01:30:55.049
VERSUS INCREMENTAL- IF YOU HAVE

01:30:55.116 --> 01:30:57.218
A VERY HIGH RIDERSHIP NEW

01:30:57.285 --> 01:30:59.153
HAPPENING INCREMENTAL INCREASE

01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:01.122
IN TERMS OF OVERALL RIDERSHIP

01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.656
THAT COULD BE A LOT MORE

01:31:01.722 --> 01:31:03.157
SIGNIFICANT IF YOU HAVE SMALL

01:31:03.224 --> 01:31:04.959
RIDERSHIP AND HAVE A

01:31:05.026 --> 01:31:05.593
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE SO I WANT

01:31:05.660 --> 01:31:08.830
YOU TO. UNDERSTAND THE NUMBERS

01:31:08.896 --> 01:31:09.363
THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:12.733
ASSEMBLYMAN FRIEDMAN- ARE VERY

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:13.267
VERY IMPORTANT NOT NOT THE

01:31:13.334 --> 01:31:17.004
TERMINOLOGY. SO INCREASING

01:31:17.071 --> 01:31:19.106
REGIONAL CAN ACTIVITY. WHICH IS

01:31:19.173 --> 01:31:21.142
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT'S WHY

01:31:21.209 --> 01:31:22.844
SEE THERE'S NOBODY ON THE HIGH

01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:25.079
SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY WHOSE EVEN

01:31:25.146 --> 01:31:25.680
PREPARE TO DOT TALK TO TALK

01:31:25.746 --> 01:31:26.981
ABOUT NOT CONNECTING. TO

01:31:27.048 --> 01:31:29.150
HOPEFULLY THE A SYSTEM THE

01:31:29.217 --> 01:31:33.087
AMTRAK SYSTEM. AND SOMEWHERE

01:31:33.154 --> 01:31:33.654
BAKERSFIELD MAYBE A SYSTEM

01:31:33.721 --> 01:31:35.056
COMING FROM THE SOUTH

01:31:35.122 --> 01:31:36.991
EVENTUALLY BUT CERTAINLY THOSE

01:31:37.058 --> 01:31:37.491
TWO SYSTEMS ARE MISSION

01:31:37.558 --> 01:31:39.427
CRITICAL. LEVERAGING BUT LOCAL

01:31:39.493 --> 01:31:41.229
MATCHING FUNDS AND I WANT TO

01:31:41.295 --> 01:31:43.464
ADD THAT COMMENT HERE THIS IS

01:31:43.531 --> 01:31:45.099
PART OF THE FUNDAMENTAL- CHARGE

01:31:45.166 --> 01:31:47.235
WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE

01:31:47.301 --> 01:31:47.835
MISSION TO BUILD A HIGH SPEED

01:31:47.902 --> 01:31:51.205
TRAIN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THAT

01:31:51.272 --> 01:31:53.207
IS NOT. I MEAN A HIGH SPEED

01:31:53.274 --> 01:31:55.209
SYSTEM IS THE WAY I VIEW THAT

01:31:55.276 --> 01:31:57.111
NOT A HIGH SPEED TRAIN ANYWHERE

01:31:57.178 --> 01:31:59.146
TO ANYWHERE. BUT HIGH SPEED

01:31:59.213 --> 01:31:59.747
SYSTEM THAT WORKS AND IT MAY

01:31:59.814 --> 01:32:01.415
TAKE A DIFFERENT BUILDING BLOCK

01:32:01.482 --> 01:32:05.152
APPROACH BUT IN OUR CHARGE IN

01:32:05.219 --> 01:32:06.988
THE IN THE ACTUAL- THE STATUES.

01:32:07.054 --> 01:32:09.257
SELECTING CORRIDORS OR USABLE

01:32:09.323 --> 01:32:09.724
SEGMENTS THERE OF FOR

01:32:09.790 --> 01:32:11.125
CONSTRUCTION THE OCEAN

01:32:11.192 --> 01:32:13.227
AUTHORITY SHALL GIVE PRIORITY

01:32:13.294 --> 01:32:13.828
TO THOSE CAR DOORS ARE USABLE

01:32:13.895 --> 01:32:15.596
SEGMENTS. THAT ARE EXPECTED TO

01:32:15.663 --> 01:32:18.933
REQUIRE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:19.567
BOND FUNDS AS A PERCENTAGE OF

01:32:19.634 --> 01:32:21.235
TOTAL COST OF CONSTRUCTION.

01:32:21.302 --> 01:32:24.972
WE'RE TOLD TO LEVERAGE MONEY.

01:32:25.039 --> 01:32:27.041
THAT MEANS LOCAL MONEY FEDERAL

01:32:27.108 --> 01:32:27.675
MONEY ANY MONEY PRIVATE MONEY-

01:32:27.742 --> 01:32:29.176
FIRST ABSENT PRIORITIES

01:32:29.243 --> 01:32:29.810
INITIATING CONSTRUCTION ON CAR

01:32:29.877 --> 01:32:31.445
DOORS OR USE USABLE SEGMENTS.

01:32:31.512 --> 01:32:37.051
SO BACK TO THE GOALS. AND I'M

01:32:37.118 --> 01:32:37.618
GONNA SAY TRACKING PRIVATE

01:32:37.685 --> 01:32:39.186
SECTOR INVESTMENT IS ONE OF

01:32:39.253 --> 01:32:41.389
THEM BUT WE HAVE BEEN VERY

01:32:41.455 --> 01:32:43.658
SUCCESSFUL BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:32:43.724 --> 01:32:45.126
IT- BUT SIGNIFICANT

01:32:45.192 --> 01:32:47.361
SIGNIFICANTLY ADDRESSING THE

01:32:47.428 --> 01:32:49.363
GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER THEY

01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:49.997
CAME OUT WITH RECENTLY AT THE

01:32:50.064 --> 01:32:51.399
QUOTE INDUCED GREENHOUSE GAS

01:32:51.465 --> 01:32:53.200
EMISSIONS AND MITIGATE THE

01:32:53.267 --> 01:32:54.969
IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WHILE

01:32:55.036 --> 01:32:55.436
BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE

01:32:55.503 --> 01:32:59.140
INCLUSIVE ECONOMY. THAT MEANS

01:32:59.206 --> 01:32:59.640
LOOKING AT THE PACKAGE

01:32:59.707 --> 01:33:01.609
HOLISTICALLY WHERE IS THE BEST

01:33:01.676 --> 01:33:03.311
VALUE FOR GREENHOUSE GAS

01:33:03.377 --> 01:33:07.148
EMISSIONS FOR INSTANCE. IT NO

01:33:07.214 --> 01:33:09.083
DOUBT THE VALLEY NEEDS HELP

01:33:09.150 --> 01:33:09.617
THERE BUT AS ASSEMBLYMAN

01:33:09.684 --> 01:33:11.018
FRIEDMAN ALSO SAID THERE'S

01:33:11.085 --> 01:33:13.154
PLACES IN LOS ANGELES THAT ARE

01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:15.356
AS BAD IF NOT WORSE THAN THE

01:33:15.423 --> 01:33:17.258
CENTRAL VALLEY AND IF WE CAN

01:33:17.325 --> 01:33:19.627
INCREASE RIDERSHIP IN THOSE CAR

01:33:19.694 --> 01:33:20.328
DOORS AT THE SAME TIME WE WILL

01:33:20.394 --> 01:33:23.164
BE DOING A BETTER JOB OVERALL

01:33:23.230 --> 01:33:23.731
I'M GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

01:33:23.798 --> 01:33:24.298
WHICH I THINK IS EXTREMELY

01:33:24.365 --> 01:33:25.099
IMPORTANT. IF WE ARE TO

01:33:25.166 --> 01:33:27.401
MAXIMIZE THOSE GOALS WE SHOULD

01:33:27.468 --> 01:33:29.236
LOOK AT OPTIONS. I DON'T HAVE

01:33:29.303 --> 01:33:31.405
THE FUNDS TO BUILD A TUNNEL

01:33:31.472 --> 01:33:33.274
BETWEEN THE VALLEY. AND THE BAY

01:33:33.341 --> 01:33:35.476
AREA OR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:33:35.543 --> 01:33:35.977
THIS IS THE FUNDAMENTAL

01:33:36.043 --> 01:33:37.578
QUESTION. AND I BELIEVE WE ARE

01:33:37.645 --> 01:33:39.613
UNLIKELY TO COMPLETE ANY TUNNEL

01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:41.515
IN LESS THAN FIFTEEN OR TWENTY

01:33:41.582 --> 01:33:43.684
YEARS. IN MY OPINION UNTIL WE

01:33:43.751 --> 01:33:45.386
HAVE TUNNELS IN EITHER

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:47.355
DIRECTION. BUILDING CATENARY IS

01:33:47.421 --> 01:33:49.023
MAINTENANCE FACILITIES AND I

01:33:49.090 --> 01:33:49.490
HIGH SPEED TRAINS IS

01:33:49.557 --> 01:33:51.625
UNNECESSARY. CONSIDERING

01:33:51.692 --> 01:33:52.093
ADVANCES IN HIGH SPEED

01:33:52.159 --> 01:33:55.496
TECHNOLOGY WHICH I HOPE WE MAY

01:33:55.563 --> 01:33:56.130
HEAR ABOUT TODAY IT MAY EVEN BE

01:33:56.197 --> 01:33:57.999
PREMATURE. UNTIL THAT TIME WE

01:33:58.065 --> 01:34:01.068
SHOULD WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS.

01:34:01.135 --> 01:34:01.702
ADDRESSING THE ISSUES THAT WERE

01:34:01.769 --> 01:34:04.972
BROUGHT UP HERE TODAY X. AMTRAK

01:34:05.039 --> 01:34:06.874
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA METROLINK

01:34:06.941 --> 01:34:07.475
VERY CRITICAL THEY CAN HELP

01:34:07.541 --> 01:34:09.443
ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS BECAUSE

01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:10.978
THEY KNOW THE COMMUNITIES A LOT

01:34:11.045 --> 01:34:11.545
BETTER THAN HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:34:11.612 --> 01:34:15.416
COMING IN. WE SHOULD WORK WITH

01:34:15.483 --> 01:34:16.951
THEM NOW TO BILL AS MUCH AS

01:34:17.018 --> 01:34:17.518
POSSIBLE IN HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:34:17.585 --> 01:34:18.085
CORRIDORS WITH THE MONEY WE

01:34:18.152 --> 01:34:21.455
HAVE. THIRTEEN BILLION INVESTED

01:34:21.522 --> 01:34:23.190
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND

01:34:23.257 --> 01:34:25.559
SMALLER MUCH SMALLER TARGETED

01:34:25.626 --> 01:34:27.395
AND LOCALLY MATCHED INVESTMENT

01:34:27.461 --> 01:34:29.663
IN THE BALKANS. IT THAT WAY

01:34:29.730 --> 01:34:30.998
IT'S POSSIBLE WE COULD HAVE

01:34:31.065 --> 01:34:33.034
THREE USABLE SEGMENTS THAT

01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:35.302
BENEFIT ALL CALIFORNIANS

01:34:35.369 --> 01:34:35.936
DELIVER BENEFITS TO THE PUBLIC

01:34:36.003 --> 01:34:37.204
EARLIER RATHER THAN LATER.

01:34:37.271 --> 01:34:39.206
THERE IS NO DOUBT OF ONE THING

01:34:39.273 --> 01:34:41.409
THE CENTRAL VALLEY WILL HAVE A

01:34:41.475 --> 01:34:43.077
VASTLY IMPROVED RAIL TRANSIT

01:34:43.144 --> 01:34:45.012
THAT WILL OPERATE AT LEAST AT A

01:34:45.079 --> 01:34:45.613
HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILES AN

01:34:45.679 --> 01:34:47.515
HOUR. HOPEFULLY IN A ONE SEAT

01:34:47.581 --> 01:34:49.116
RIDE IF WE CAN JUST ARE

01:34:49.183 --> 01:34:51.118
THINKING PERHAPS WE CAN DO

01:34:51.185 --> 01:34:51.752
SOONER. AND AT LESS COST. THANK

01:34:51.819 --> 01:34:57.658
YOU. IF I MAY I'M GOING TO ASK-

01:34:57.725 --> 01:34:59.226
DIRECTOR KELLY DID COME FORWARD

01:34:59.293 --> 01:34:59.860
IF YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO SOME

01:34:59.927 --> 01:35:01.228
OF THE QUESTIONS BUT- I MAY

01:35:01.295 --> 01:35:03.597
START BY SAYING IT'S A BIT

01:35:03.664 --> 01:35:05.199
DISINGENUOUS TO QUOTE PART OF

01:35:05.266 --> 01:35:07.601
THE OP ED AND NOT. TO LOOK AT

01:35:07.668 --> 01:35:09.270
THE REST OF THE WORDS. GOVERNOR

01:35:09.336 --> 01:35:11.305
NEW SOME USED WITHIN THAT THAT

01:35:11.372 --> 01:35:13.374
AND TORREI OPEN AS HE WAS CLEAR

01:35:13.441 --> 01:35:15.142
ABOUT HIS INTENTIONS- I WOULD

01:35:15.209 --> 01:35:17.178
ALSO SAY THAT THOSE OF US WHO

01:35:17.244 --> 01:35:19.447
VOTED FOR CAP AND TRADE. DIDN'T

01:35:19.513 --> 01:35:21.582
VOTE FOR IT TO WORK ON HIGHER

01:35:21.649 --> 01:35:23.250
SPEED RAIL AND AMTRAK WE VOTED

01:35:23.317 --> 01:35:25.286
ON IT TO ENSURE THAT WE COULD

01:35:25.352 --> 01:35:27.188
DELIVER HIGH SPEED RAIL FOR OUR

01:35:27.254 --> 01:35:28.889
COMMUNITIES. WITH THAT I'D LIKE

01:35:28.956 --> 01:35:31.192
TO ASK DIRECTOR KELLY. IT IS A

01:35:31.258 --> 01:35:31.725
QUESTION OF THAT I MIGHT

01:35:31.792 --> 01:35:33.294
ADDRESS ON THAT- BECAUSE I'D

01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:37.264
LIKE TO RESPOND. I WILL ALLOW

01:35:37.331 --> 01:35:37.765
TIME BUT SURE STILL HAVE

01:35:37.832 --> 01:35:41.235
DIRECTOR CAN. WELL THERE'S BEEN

01:35:41.302 --> 01:35:43.404
A LOT SAID I WAS EVEN QUOTED IN

01:35:43.471 --> 01:35:43.971
THE END OF THE TABLE SO I

01:35:44.038 --> 01:35:44.905
MIGHT. KNOW RESPONDED THAT-

01:35:44.972 --> 01:35:47.641
LOOK CONNECTIVITY IS A KEY

01:35:47.708 --> 01:35:48.309
POINT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:35:48.375 --> 01:35:48.943
DO HERE LET'S BE REALLY CLEAR.

01:35:49.009 --> 01:35:51.045
THE BOND BILL SAID BUILD A HIGH

01:35:51.112 --> 01:35:52.913
SPEED RAIL SYSTEM THAT CONNECTS

01:35:52.980 --> 01:35:55.049
THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AREA IN THE

01:35:55.116 --> 01:35:56.917
LOS ANGELES BASIN. HIGH SPEED

01:35:56.984 --> 01:35:59.120
IS DEFINED IN THE LAW. TO MILES

01:35:59.186 --> 01:36:01.288
PER HOUR MORE NINE HUNDRED

01:36:01.355 --> 01:36:01.856
SEVENTY MILES IN THE VALLEY.

01:36:01.922 --> 01:36:03.124
NOT ONE TEN AND I WANT TWENTY

01:36:03.190 --> 01:36:04.992
FIVE. THAT'S IN THE LAW TODAY.

01:36:05.059 --> 01:36:05.493
SO THAT IS WHAT WE ARE

01:36:05.559 --> 01:36:09.463
INTENDING TO BILL. UNLIKE ANY

01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:10.131
OTHER REGION OF THE STATE RIGHT

01:36:10.197 --> 01:36:13.167
NOW. AND THE DECISION THAT WE

01:36:13.234 --> 01:36:13.801
DO NOT MAKE YOUR ALONE. BUT THE

01:36:13.868 --> 01:36:15.169
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S TO GET

01:36:15.236 --> 01:36:15.836
STARTED SOMEWHERE THEY SAID GET

01:36:15.903 --> 01:36:17.371
STARTED IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

01:36:17.438 --> 01:36:19.140
SO THIS IS THE ONLY REGION IN

01:36:19.206 --> 01:36:21.108
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE

01:36:21.175 --> 01:36:21.675
HUNDRED NINETY MILES. INTO

01:36:21.742 --> 01:36:25.045
CONSTRUCTION. SO THE QUESTION

01:36:25.112 --> 01:36:25.546
IS. DO WE FINISH THAT

01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:27.114
CONSTRUCTION AND HAVE A LINE

01:36:27.181 --> 01:36:28.816
FROM MADERA TO POPLAR AVENUE.

01:36:28.883 --> 01:36:31.018
IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ORCHARD.

01:36:31.085 --> 01:36:31.652
WHERE DO WE EXTENDED TO CONNECT

01:36:31.719 --> 01:36:33.053
THREE THE FASTEST GROWING

01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:34.822
CITIES. IN THREE OF THE FASTEST

01:36:34.889 --> 01:36:35.456
GROWING COUNTIES IN THE STATE

01:36:35.523 --> 01:36:37.258
OF CALIFORNIA. MERCED FRESNO

01:36:37.324 --> 01:36:39.226
BAKERSFIELD. WITH HIGH SPEED

01:36:39.293 --> 01:36:41.061
RAIL THAT IS CONNECTED. TO AN

01:36:41.128 --> 01:36:43.364
EXPANDED A SYSTEM THAT THE

01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:44.732
STATE OF CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE

01:36:44.798 --> 01:36:47.101
RESPONDING. TO THE TUNE OF

01:36:47.168 --> 01:36:47.701
ALMOST A BILLION DOLLARS. ETS

01:36:47.768 --> 01:36:53.107
EXTENSION NUMBER SAID- AND. THE

01:36:53.174 --> 01:36:53.707
SAN JOAQUIN'S LINE TO OAKLAND.

01:36:53.774 --> 01:37:01.081
AND SACK. MY VIEW IS YES I KNOW

01:37:01.148 --> 01:37:01.749
I'M CERTAINLY NOT OF NOT A- SHY

01:37:01.815 --> 01:37:02.183
ADVOCATE A WHAT I'M

01:37:02.249 --> 01:37:03.417
RECOMMENDING TO MY BOARD. YOU

01:37:03.484 --> 01:37:04.018
KNOW I HAVE A HUNDRED NINETY

01:37:04.084 --> 01:37:05.152
MILES IN A CONSTRUCTION NOW.

01:37:05.219 --> 01:37:05.753
AND WHEN WE LEAVE THE VALLEY.

01:37:05.819 --> 01:37:06.420
I'M GONNA LEAVE THE VALLEY WITH

01:37:06.487 --> 01:37:08.989
VALUE. AND THAT DOES NOT MEAN A

01:37:09.056 --> 01:37:11.358
LINE. THAT IS NOT OPERABLE. AND

01:37:11.425 --> 01:37:13.060
I WANNA BE REALLY CLEAR. WE

01:37:13.127 --> 01:37:13.694
DIDN'T CHOOSE THIS OFF THE TOP

01:37:13.761 --> 01:37:15.162
OF OUR HEADS. WE WERE VERY

01:37:15.229 --> 01:37:17.298
CLEAR IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN

01:37:17.364 --> 01:37:19.033
BUSINESS PLAN. THAT BECAUSE WE

01:37:19.099 --> 01:37:21.101
HAD FUNDING CONSTRAINTS WE WERE

01:37:21.168 --> 01:37:21.702
GOING TO ASK OUR EARLY TRAIN

01:37:21.769 --> 01:37:23.237
OPERATOR TO LOOK AT OPTIONS AND

01:37:23.304 --> 01:37:25.206
GIVE US ADVICE. IN KNOWING THAT

01:37:25.272 --> 01:37:27.208
WE STARTED WITH A HUNDRED

01:37:27.274 --> 01:37:27.775
NINETY MILES AN ABOUT. THEY

01:37:27.841 --> 01:37:29.376
TOOK A LOOK AT THAT AND THEY

01:37:29.443 --> 01:37:31.378
SAID. THE BEST LINE YOU CAN DO

01:37:31.445 --> 01:37:33.113
IN THE VALUES IN IN A ROOM

01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:35.082
SERVICE MATTER. IS MERCED

01:37:35.149 --> 01:37:36.984
FRESNO BAKERSFIELD. THAT'S WHY

01:37:37.051 --> 01:37:37.585
WE ARE PURSUING THIS. ON THE

01:37:37.651 --> 01:37:39.420
RIDERSHIP QUESTION THERE'S NO

01:37:39.486 --> 01:37:41.388
QUESTION. THAT RIDERSHIP GROWTH

01:37:41.455 --> 01:37:43.390
IS KEY. UNDER THE EARLY TRAIN

01:37:43.457 --> 01:37:45.359
OPERATOR ANALYSIS THAT WE GOT

01:37:45.426 --> 01:37:47.061
BACK IN OUR PROJECT UPDATE

01:37:47.127 --> 01:37:47.595
REPORT WE'RE DOUBLING THE

01:37:47.661 --> 01:37:49.330
RIDERSHIP. IN THE VALLEY.

01:37:49.396 --> 01:37:51.065
DOUBLING THE RIDERSHIP. WE'RE

01:37:51.131 --> 01:37:52.833
EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF TRAINS

01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:53.400
THAT CAN BE DONE. BUT I CAN

01:37:53.467 --> 01:37:55.269
OPERATE ON THIS LINE. WE'RE

01:37:55.336 --> 01:37:57.137
DOING IT QUICKER AND WE'RE

01:37:57.204 --> 01:37:59.139
DOUBLING THE RIDERSHIP. SO THEY

01:37:59.206 --> 01:38:01.175
ARE NOW GOING THROUGH A PROCESS

01:38:01.242 --> 01:38:03.143
TO WERE LOOK AT THOSE NUMBERS.

01:38:03.210 --> 01:38:03.744
REFINE THEM THEY'LL COME BACK

01:38:03.811 --> 01:38:07.081
TO MY BOARD WAS- A SPECIFIC

01:38:07.147 --> 01:38:08.983
RECOMMENDATIONS. I GUESS MY

01:38:09.049 --> 01:38:11.051
LAST COMMENT IS JUST THIS. IS

01:38:11.118 --> 01:38:12.953
SAD WERE HAVING A CONVERSATION

01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:13.587
THE WAY WE'RE HAVIN IS DANNY'S

01:38:13.654 --> 01:38:15.089
DISAPPOINTED THAT THE- THE

01:38:15.155 --> 01:38:17.224
SUGGEST THERE'S- YOU KNOW

01:38:17.291 --> 01:38:17.825
THERE'S DIVIDE BETWEEN PEOPLE

01:38:17.891 --> 01:38:19.560
WHO SEE THE WORLD THE SAME WAY.

01:38:19.627 --> 01:38:21.262
I GUESS I THINK IT'S

01:38:21.328 --> 01:38:23.264
UNFORTUNATE TO. THE IDEA TO

01:38:23.330 --> 01:38:25.232
DIVERT MONEY FROM WHAT WE'RE

01:38:25.299 --> 01:38:26.934
DOING NOW AND SPEND IT ON

01:38:27.001 --> 01:38:29.169
REGIONAL SERVICES TO ME. IS NOT

01:38:29.236 --> 01:38:29.803
CONSISTENT WITH THE MISSION OF

01:38:29.870 --> 01:38:31.238
HIGH SPEED RAIL THAT'S MY VIEW.

01:38:31.305 --> 01:38:33.207
DAN IT'S GOT A DIFFERENT ONE I

01:38:33.274 --> 01:38:35.175
THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA. TO HAVE

01:38:35.242 --> 01:38:37.177
A CONVERSATION TO FIGURE OUT

01:38:37.244 --> 01:38:37.811
WHAT YOU WANT TO BE LEFT WITHIN

01:38:37.878 --> 01:38:39.179
CITY CALIFORNIA WHAT I THINK

01:38:39.246 --> 01:38:41.081
WOULD BE A TRAGEDY. IS IT

01:38:41.148 --> 01:38:43.417
DIVIDE THE DIVERTED THE MONEY

01:38:43.484 --> 01:38:43.984
TO OTHER PLACES. AND YOU'RE

01:38:44.051 --> 01:38:45.552
LEFT WITH GOVERNMENTAL SPEED.

01:38:45.619 --> 01:38:47.254
IMPROVEMENTS ON LARGELY DIESEL

01:38:47.321 --> 01:38:49.456
SIR. AT THE END OF INVESTING

01:38:49.523 --> 01:38:50.924
THAT MONEY ELSEWHERE. AND A

01:38:50.991 --> 01:38:53.060
HUNDRED NINETY MILE LINE

01:38:53.127 --> 01:38:53.594
BETWEEN MADERA IN POPLAR.

01:38:53.661 --> 01:38:55.029
SITTING IN THE VALLEY. THAT'S

01:38:55.095 --> 01:38:57.564
WHAT I THINK WOULD BE TRAGIC.

01:38:57.631 --> 01:38:59.233
AND SO MY VIEW IS. GET THE HIGH

01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:00.934
SPEED ELECTRIFIED RAIL GOING

01:39:01.001 --> 01:39:03.070
FINISHER ENVIRONMENTAL WORK.

01:39:03.137 --> 01:39:05.039
AND THEN WORK ON FUNDING THE

01:39:05.105 --> 01:39:07.207
GAPS. IN THE LA BASIN INTO THE

01:39:07.274 --> 01:39:09.209
BAY AREA. AND WITH THE

01:39:09.276 --> 01:39:15.115
EMERGENCE OF A PRIVATE TRAIN.

01:39:15.182 --> 01:39:15.716
OPERATOR DEMONSTRATE INTEREST

01:39:15.783 --> 01:39:21.221
SELECT A FIVE SPEED RAIL TODAY.

01:39:21.288 --> 01:39:23.590
WE PROBABLY GOT HAD TO DO THAT.

01:39:23.657 --> 01:39:24.158
THAT'S A BETTER CONVERSATION

01:39:24.224 --> 01:39:24.758
LATER CERTAINLY THE ONE RIGHT

01:39:24.825 --> 01:39:27.494
NOW. SO IF I MAKE- I THINK

01:39:27.561 --> 01:39:29.363
WE'RE GONNA HOPEFULLY HEAR FROM

01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:31.365
THE- PARTNERS WHO WILL ADDRESS

01:39:31.432 --> 01:39:31.965
SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS. BUT I

01:39:32.032 --> 01:39:35.135
THINK- BRIAN POINTED OUT TO THE

01:39:35.202 --> 01:39:35.669
US FOR STAND HE SHE PRETTY

01:39:35.736 --> 01:39:37.137
CLEAR TO ME. AND I WILL READ

01:39:37.204 --> 01:39:37.638
FROM THE EDITORIAL FOR A

01:39:37.705 --> 01:39:39.807
SECOND- IT'S SIMILARLY TAKING

01:39:39.873 --> 01:39:40.441
MONEY FROM THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:39:40.507 --> 01:39:41.508
PROJECT. AND DIVERTED TO RAIL

01:39:41.575 --> 01:39:45.212
SYSTEMS IN THEIR READ. THAT'S

01:39:45.279 --> 01:39:47.414
THE EDITORIAL FACT OF THE

01:39:47.481 --> 01:39:47.915
MATTER IS AND WE'RE NOT

01:39:47.981 --> 01:39:49.450
DIVERTING IT FROM HI FI RAIL

01:39:49.516 --> 01:39:51.118
PROJECT TO PUT IT INTO OTHER

01:39:51.185 --> 01:39:53.554
TRAIN OPERATION IF THERE IS ANY

01:39:53.620 --> 01:39:55.389
DIVERSION IT'S GOING TO HIGH

01:39:55.456 --> 01:39:57.324
SPEED RAIL TRACK THAT WE JUST

01:39:57.391 --> 01:39:58.859
LIKE THERE IS IN THE BALLOT.

01:39:58.926 --> 01:40:01.128
THESE ARE TRACKS THAT WILL HAVE

01:40:01.195 --> 01:40:03.030
TO BE BUILT THERE ON OUR CAR

01:40:03.097 --> 01:40:03.664
DOORS SO TO IMPLY THAT IT'S

01:40:03.731 --> 01:40:06.500
SIMPLY TAKING MONEY FROM HERE

01:40:06.567 --> 01:40:07.201
TO PUT IT OVER THERE AT THE

01:40:07.267 --> 01:40:09.336
EXPENSE OF HIGH SPEED RAIL THE

01:40:09.403 --> 01:40:11.038
FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES AND IT WAS

01:40:11.105 --> 01:40:13.307
ABOUT IS OUR CHARGE TO GET A

01:40:13.374 --> 01:40:15.376
HIGH SPEED TRAIN UP AS SOON AS

01:40:15.442 --> 01:40:17.478
POSSIBLE OR IS THE BILL THE

01:40:17.544 --> 01:40:19.380
SYSTEM THE BEST WE CAN UNTIL WE

01:40:19.446 --> 01:40:21.115
CAN GET A HIGH SPEED SYSTEM

01:40:21.181 --> 01:40:21.682
WELL. THAT'S A FUNDAMENTAL

01:40:21.749 --> 01:40:23.951
DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AND YOU

01:40:24.017 --> 01:40:25.185
KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOT A

01:40:25.252 --> 01:40:29.390
STRANDED ASSETS AGAIN THAT'S

01:40:29.456 --> 01:40:31.759
THE US VERSUS THEM. IT WE'RE

01:40:31.825 --> 01:40:32.426
TALKING ABOUT A COMPLETE SYSTEM

01:40:32.493 --> 01:40:35.028
IN THE VALLEY THAT WILL GET YOU

01:40:35.095 --> 01:40:36.964
TO THE BAY AREA. OR SACRAMENTO

01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:37.598
ON A ONE RIDE ON A TRAIN THAT

01:40:37.664 --> 01:40:40.901
CAN GO ON AND TWENTY FIVE MILES

01:40:40.968 --> 01:40:42.970
AN HOUR. NOT A PODIUM TRAINING

01:40:43.036 --> 01:40:45.005
FROM OF WHATEVER FIELD HE SAID

01:40:45.072 --> 01:40:45.606
TO ANOTHER PLACE THAT IS NOT

01:40:45.672 --> 01:40:47.408
THE OPTION WE'RE NOT HAVING THE

01:40:47.474 --> 01:40:49.176
REAL CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT

01:40:49.243 --> 01:40:51.011
OPTION. IF WE CHOOSE THAT

01:40:51.078 --> 01:40:51.645
OPTION OR IF WE CHOOSE ONE OF

01:40:51.712 --> 01:40:53.280
THESE OPTIONS IT DOES PRESENT

01:40:53.347 --> 01:40:55.215
POTENTIAL FOR MORE MONEY TO BE

01:40:55.282 --> 01:40:57.217
INVESTED INVESTED ON OUR CAR

01:40:57.284 --> 01:40:59.486
DOORS. TO DO THE THINGS WE NEED

01:40:59.553 --> 01:41:01.388
TO DO. ANYWAY TO GET A HIGH

01:41:01.455 --> 01:41:02.055
SPEED RAIL SYSTEM UP AND I WANT

01:41:02.122 --> 01:41:04.858
TO MAKE ONE POINT. ABOUT THE

01:41:04.925 --> 01:41:05.492
FOR THE SPEED. THERE'S NO WAY A

01:41:05.559 --> 01:41:07.494
HIGH SPEED TRAIN AND SO THE

01:41:07.561 --> 01:41:09.129
CALIFORNIA OR IN THE BAY AREA

01:41:09.196 --> 01:41:11.298
IT'S GOING TO TWO HUNDRED MILES

01:41:11.365 --> 01:41:13.200
AN HOUR. PERIOD END OF

01:41:13.267 --> 01:41:15.402
DISCUSSION A HUNDRED TEN TWO

01:41:15.469 --> 01:41:16.003
HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE I BELIEVE

01:41:16.069 --> 01:41:17.404
IS THE MAXIMUM POSSIBILITY. THE

01:41:17.471 --> 01:41:19.306
ONLY PLACE THAT IS IN THE

01:41:19.373 --> 01:41:23.210
VALLEY. YES WE COULD BUILD THAT

01:41:23.277 --> 01:41:27.114
AND ZOOM UP AND. DOWN BUT WE

01:41:27.181 --> 01:41:27.714
WOULD BE BETTER OFF CONNECTING

01:41:27.781 --> 01:41:31.485
TO EIGHT. A SYSTEM THAT CAN RUN

01:41:31.552 --> 01:41:33.420
AT A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILES

01:41:33.487 --> 01:41:34.054
AN HOUR. AND MAKE IT BETTER CAN

01:41:34.121 --> 01:41:35.422
ACTIVITY AND BUILD RIDERSHIP.

01:41:35.489 --> 01:41:36.023
BUT THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE OF

01:41:36.089 --> 01:41:37.191
OPINION. IF I MAY THE IBM OR

01:41:37.257 --> 01:41:39.326
PROP ONE A WAS VERY CLEAR ABOUT

01:41:39.393 --> 01:41:41.495
NEEDING A TRUCK CAM THAT RUNS

01:41:41.562 --> 01:41:42.963
TWO HUNDRED MILES PER HOUR BUT

01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:45.165
LOST. SO IF WE ARE UNABLE TO

01:41:45.232 --> 01:41:46.934
BUILD THIS CENTRAL ABOUT THE

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.069
SECTION WE ARE UNABLE TO THEN

01:41:49.136 --> 01:41:51.271
MEET. THE REQUIREMENTS OF PROP

01:41:51.338 --> 01:41:51.839
ONE ATTY AND UNFORTUNATELY I

01:41:51.905 --> 01:41:55.075
DON'T LIKE TELLING VOTERS WHEN

01:41:55.142 --> 01:41:55.509
THEY TOLD US QUITE

01:41:55.576 --> 01:41:57.177
SPECIFICALLY. WHAT THEY WANTED

01:41:57.244 --> 01:41:59.546
FROM US SO THAT WE ARE CHANGING

01:41:59.613 --> 01:42:01.582
PLANS. SO DO YOU THINK THE

01:42:01.648 --> 01:42:02.216
VOTERS TOLD YOU TO BUILD A HIGH

01:42:02.282 --> 01:42:05.252
SPEED TRAIN. NO MATTER WHERE NO

01:42:05.319 --> 01:42:07.054
MATTER WHY BECAUSE WE WANT TO

01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:08.989
SEE HIGHS BE RETRAIN. OR THEY

01:42:09.056 --> 01:42:09.556
WANT TO BUILD A HIGH SPEED

01:42:09.623 --> 01:42:11.325
TRAIN SYSTEM AND GET THE MOST

01:42:11.391 --> 01:42:13.260
BENEFITS OUT OF BUILDING THAT

01:42:13.327 --> 01:42:15.128
SYSTEM. FROM NOW UNTIL WE

01:42:15.195 --> 01:42:16.964
COMPLETED. THAT'S THE

01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.531
FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IN MY

01:42:17.598 --> 01:42:19.399
OPENING STATEMENT SITE

01:42:19.466 --> 01:42:19.933
REFERENCE WHAT PROP ONE A

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.401
SPECIFIC. ASKED US TO DO THAT'S

01:42:21.468 --> 01:42:23.770
WHAT I BELIEVE THE VOTERS WANT

01:42:23.837 --> 01:42:27.674
US. TO DO. AND I THINK THAT'S

01:42:27.741 --> 01:42:28.242
WHAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO

01:42:28.308 --> 01:42:35.315
FOLLOW. MISTER JIM. YOU KNOW I

01:42:35.382 --> 01:42:37.584
THINK THE- IT'S A FOR THIS IS A

01:42:37.651 --> 01:42:39.253
THIS OR THAT CONVERSATION

01:42:39.319 --> 01:42:43.257
BECAUSE. I THINK THE KEY IS WE

01:42:43.323 --> 01:42:44.892
KNOW NOW IS WE HAVE A FINITE

01:42:44.958 --> 01:42:45.425
BUDGET BEFORE US HERE HIGH

01:42:45.492 --> 01:42:47.361
SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY OF MY

01:42:47.427 --> 01:42:49.530
BUDGET A MISSION IN THE LAW

01:42:49.596 --> 01:42:50.097
ABOUT WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO

01:42:50.163 --> 01:42:53.300
CONTROL AND- BUT WE HAVE THE

01:42:53.367 --> 01:42:55.335
CAPABILITY TO DO. THINGS

01:42:55.402 --> 01:42:55.969
IMPORTANTLY HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE

01:42:56.036 --> 01:42:59.106
MILES IS NOT A CHUMP CHANGE.

01:42:59.172 --> 01:43:01.241
ROUTE THAT'S A PRETTY LOW ON

01:43:01.308 --> 01:43:03.010
THE HIGH SPEED RAIL ROUTE GET

01:43:03.076 --> 01:43:05.412
STARTED IT IS THE BEGINNING NOT

01:43:05.479 --> 01:43:06.046
THE END BUT WE START THAT WE

01:43:06.113 --> 01:43:09.116
FINISH THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK.

01:43:09.182 --> 01:43:11.218
ALL THE WAY FROM SAN FRANCISCO.

01:43:11.285 --> 01:43:11.852
I IN ANAHEIM AND THEN YOU WORK

01:43:11.919 --> 01:43:13.253
ON THE FUNDING APPS AGAIN YOU

01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:15.389
HAVE THE EMERGENCE OF A PRIVATE

01:43:15.455 --> 01:43:17.090
ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:43:17.157 --> 01:43:19.426
OPERATOR. NOW ENTERING THE LA

01:43:19.493 --> 01:43:21.328
BASIN FROM THE EAST AND- MAKING

01:43:21.395 --> 01:43:22.996
THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- BASIN

01:43:23.063 --> 01:43:25.399
AN INTERESTING PLACE TO

01:43:25.465 --> 01:43:25.966
CONSIDER HOW WE MOVE FORWARD

01:43:26.033 --> 01:43:27.568
TOGETHER. BOTH THE STATE IN A

01:43:27.634 --> 01:43:29.403
PRIVATE PRIVATE PARTNER. I'D

01:43:29.469 --> 01:43:31.505
ALSO SAY THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:43:31.572 --> 01:43:32.105
REVENUE STREAMS OUT THERE IN

01:43:32.172 --> 01:43:34.875
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA-

01:43:34.942 --> 01:43:35.509
BETWEEN CAP AND TRADE AND OTHER

01:43:35.576 --> 01:43:37.377
THINGS. IN IT YOU KNOW THE

01:43:37.444 --> 01:43:39.246
ISSUE IS HOW BIG IS THE PIE-

01:43:39.313 --> 01:43:41.248
RIGHT NOW I'VE GOT A VERY

01:43:41.315 --> 01:43:43.250
CONSTRAINED PIE THAT I'M

01:43:43.317 --> 01:43:44.785
WORKING ON- BUT THERE ARE.

01:43:44.851 --> 01:43:47.120
OTHER CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS-

01:43:47.187 --> 01:43:51.158
AND- THE IDEA OF UTILIZING SOME

01:43:51.224 --> 01:43:51.792
OF THESE THINGS SO THAT WE CAN

01:43:51.858 --> 01:43:52.893
DO MORE CONCURRENT INVESTMENTS-

01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:55.262
IN THIS AREA SO THAT WE CAN

01:43:55.329 --> 01:43:57.397
BOTH- CONSTRUCT WHAT WE WANT TO

01:43:57.464 --> 01:43:59.199
CONSTRUCT IN THE VALLEY. AND

01:43:59.266 --> 01:43:59.700
FORD EXPANDING REGIONAL

01:43:59.766 --> 01:44:01.268
SERVICES IN THE LA BASIN AND

01:44:01.335 --> 01:44:03.203
THE BAY AREA. I THINK THERE'S A

01:44:03.270 --> 01:44:05.105
POTENTIAL THERE I THINK THE

01:44:05.172 --> 01:44:07.107
QUESTION IS HOW CAN UTILIZE CAP

01:44:07.174 --> 01:44:09.142
AND TRADE DOLLARS BEYOND WHAT'S

01:44:09.209 --> 01:44:11.011
DEDICATED TO US. TO DO THAT. I

01:44:11.078 --> 01:44:11.612
THINK WHAT WE REACT TO IS THE

01:44:11.678 --> 01:44:13.380
IDEA WE SHOULD TAKE IT FROM

01:44:13.447 --> 01:44:15.015
THERE AND SPEND IT THERE AND

01:44:15.082 --> 01:44:16.984
THAT'S WHAT WOULD I THINK WE'RE

01:44:17.050 --> 01:44:21.054
PUSHING BACK I THINK. THE IDEA

01:44:21.121 --> 01:44:21.655
THOUGH THAT WE CAN. LOOK AT A

01:44:21.722 --> 01:44:25.325
BROAD. REVENUE SOURCE IN

01:44:25.392 --> 01:44:27.094
CALIFORNIA AND FIGURE OUT. HOW

01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:27.661
CAN WE BEST UTILIZE THIS TO

01:44:27.728 --> 01:44:29.296
CHIEF COLLECTIVE OBJECTIVES. I

01:44:29.363 --> 01:44:29.896
HEARD ASSEMBLY WOMAN FRIEDMAN

01:44:29.963 --> 01:44:31.498
SAY EARLIER. YOU KNOW SHE WANTS

01:44:31.565 --> 01:44:33.166
TO RIDE THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:44:33.233 --> 01:44:33.734
TRAIL. I WANTED TO RIDE THE

01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:35.102
HIGH SPEED ROTARY. SHE ALSO

01:44:35.168 --> 01:44:37.004
WANTS IMPROVEMENTS ON. THOSE

01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:39.272
THE MORE TRADITIONAL SERVICES

01:44:39.339 --> 01:44:41.041
IN- IN OUR REGION I WANT THOSE

01:44:41.108 --> 01:44:43.143
IMPROVEMENTS TO. AND I AM

01:44:43.210 --> 01:44:45.012
CONVINCED. THAT WHEN THE SPINE

01:44:45.078 --> 01:44:46.913
SYSTEM THAT DOES GO FAST.

01:44:46.980 --> 01:44:49.049
CONNECTION THOSE REGIONAL AREAS

01:44:49.116 --> 01:44:51.118
IT WILL LIFT RIDERSHIP ON ALL

01:44:51.184 --> 01:44:51.785
OF. THE BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN THE

01:44:51.852 --> 01:44:53.220
EXPERIENCE AROUND THE GLOBE.

01:44:53.286 --> 01:44:53.787
WHEN YOU TAKE A HIGH SPEED

01:44:53.854 --> 01:44:55.522
TRAIN FROM ONE CITY TO ANOTHER.

01:44:55.589 --> 01:44:57.357
AND YOU GET IN THAT CITY WITH

01:44:57.424 --> 01:44:58.892
THE CONNECTED TRAIN STATION.

01:44:58.959 --> 01:45:01.228
PEOPLE TEND TO GET OFF THAT AND

01:45:01.294 --> 01:45:01.828
USE LOCAL TRENDS. AND THAT'S

01:45:01.895 --> 01:45:03.196
WHAT WE LIKE TO SEE REPEATED

01:45:03.263 --> 01:45:04.998
HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO IT'S A

01:45:05.065 --> 01:45:07.300
HEALTHY ROBUST CONVERSATION. I

01:45:07.367 --> 01:45:09.102
DON'T FEEL LIKE WE'RE ON THE-

01:45:09.169 --> 01:45:10.904
OPPOSITE SIDES OF WHAT IT LOOKS

01:45:10.971 --> 01:45:11.538
LIKE AT THE END IT'S KINDA HOW

01:45:11.605 --> 01:45:13.106
WE GET THERE. AND I THINK MAYBE

01:45:13.173 --> 01:45:14.975
WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT HOW THAT

01:45:15.042 --> 01:45:15.542
PIE COULD BE EXPANDED AND

01:45:15.609 --> 01:45:19.179
UTILIZED. AS OPPOSED. TO TALK A

01:45:19.246 --> 01:45:19.746
WAR BETWEEN REVENUES BETWEEN

01:45:19.813 --> 01:45:25.419
DIFFERENT ENTITIES. SOMEONE

01:45:25.485 --> 01:45:26.019
FRIEDMAN ANY QUESTIONS BEFORE

01:45:26.086 --> 01:45:29.256
WE MOVE ON TO HELEN CURSED.

01:45:29.322 --> 01:45:29.723
WELL FIRST I AM REALLY

01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:31.625
ENJOYING- THE CONVERSATION.

01:45:31.692 --> 01:45:33.193
UHHUH MMHM I IS JUST REMIND

01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:35.362
EVERYONE YOU TALK ABOUT PROP

01:45:35.429 --> 01:45:36.029
ONE A ALSO IT WAS VERY SPECIFIC

01:45:36.096 --> 01:45:37.197
THE PUT THE VOTERS AS A

01:45:37.264 --> 01:45:38.865
CONNECTION BETWEEN SAN

01:45:38.932 --> 01:45:41.168
FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES IT'S

01:45:41.234 --> 01:45:43.003
NOT A CONNECTION BETWEEN PARTS

01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:45.105
OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS A MUCH

01:45:45.172 --> 01:45:45.672
IS THAT'S IMPORTANT TO THE

01:45:45.739 --> 01:45:47.140
SYSTEM AND WE HAVE TO KEEP THAT

01:45:47.207 --> 01:45:48.975
IN MIND. AND THE RESTRICTION

01:45:49.042 --> 01:45:49.609
ABOUT THE HIGH SPEED PART AS

01:45:49.676 --> 01:45:51.411
FAR AS I KNOW WAS ON THE BOND

01:45:51.478 --> 01:45:52.946
SECTION ON THE CAP AND TRADE

01:45:53.013 --> 01:45:54.981
SECTION WHICH IS A MUCH LARGER.

01:45:55.048 --> 01:45:57.117
PORTION OF THE FUNDING SO I

01:45:57.184 --> 01:46:00.987
THINK WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WE

01:46:01.054 --> 01:46:01.588
SAID WE'RE GOING TO SPEND THE

01:46:01.655 --> 01:46:02.155
MONEY ON ONE THING AND NOW

01:46:02.222 --> 01:46:02.923
WE'RE TAKING IT TO SOMETHING

01:46:02.989 --> 01:46:04.958
ELSE NO NOBODY IS SUGGESTING

01:46:05.025 --> 01:46:05.559
USING IT FOR SOMETHING ELSE

01:46:05.625 --> 01:46:07.327
EVERYBODY IS SAYING HOW DO WE

01:46:07.394 --> 01:46:09.362
DO WITH THE VOTERS ASSETS TO DO

01:46:09.429 --> 01:46:11.198
WHICH IS TO BUILD HIGH SPEED

01:46:11.264 --> 01:46:13.166
SERVICE AFFECTED TRAIN SERVICE.

01:46:13.233 --> 01:46:15.235
BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS

01:46:15.302 --> 01:46:17.337
ANGELES AND DO IT IN A WAY THAT

01:46:17.404 --> 01:46:19.372
BRINGS US CLOSER TO THAT VISION

01:46:19.439 --> 01:46:23.243
OF BEING ABLE TO GET ON A

01:46:23.310 --> 01:46:23.777
TRAIN. AT UNION STATION OR

01:46:23.844 --> 01:46:29.249
BURBANK. TO GO TO SAN DIEGO BUT

01:46:29.316 --> 01:46:29.783
AT LEAST FOR PROP ONE IS

01:46:29.850 --> 01:46:31.118
PURPOSE. AND NORTH. OF AND THE

01:46:31.184 --> 01:46:33.019
QUESTION IS DO WE DO THAT BEST

01:46:33.086 --> 01:46:33.620
BUY STICKING THE COURSE AND

01:46:33.687 --> 01:46:35.422
DOING THAT. TRUE HIGH SPEED

01:46:35.489 --> 01:46:39.192
SERVICE. BETWEEN THE AREAS THAT

01:46:39.259 --> 01:46:39.760
WE HAVE IT UNDER CONCERNED-

01:46:39.826 --> 01:46:42.963
CONSTRUCTION OR DO WE- SPREAD

01:46:43.029 --> 01:46:45.132
THE MONEY FURTHER UP AND DOWN

01:46:45.198 --> 01:46:45.732
THAT LINE WHICH WAS THE GOAL

01:46:45.799 --> 01:46:49.035
THAT WHOLE LINE. AND GET MORE

01:46:49.102 --> 01:46:49.603
GET THAT MIND WORKING AS

01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:51.204
EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE AND

01:46:51.271 --> 01:46:53.440
THEN- COMPLETE THE PROJECT AND

01:46:53.507 --> 01:46:55.375
I DON'T THINK THAT PUTS US ON

01:46:55.442 --> 01:46:57.177
OTHER SITES I DON'T THINK

01:46:57.244 --> 01:46:59.346
THAT'S ABOUT MOVING MONEY FROM

01:46:59.412 --> 01:46:59.880
ONE REGION TO ANOTHER AND

01:46:59.946 --> 01:47:01.181
CHANGING THAT EXPERIENCE I WANT

01:47:01.248 --> 01:47:01.715
THE PEOPLE IN THE CENTRAL

01:47:01.782 --> 01:47:03.250
VALLEY. TO GET ON THE TRAIN AND

01:47:03.316 --> 01:47:05.152
TO DO THAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE

01:47:05.218 --> 01:47:07.020
THE BEST AND MOST SEAMLESS

01:47:07.087 --> 01:47:09.022
TRAIN EXPERIENCE AND I AM

01:47:09.089 --> 01:47:09.689
CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT MR CURTAIN

01:47:09.756 --> 01:47:11.358
POINTS OUT ABOUT HAVING TO

01:47:11.424 --> 01:47:13.460
CHANGE TRAINS AS SOMEONE WHO'S-

01:47:13.527 --> 01:47:15.095
HAD TO CHANGE ON A LOT OF

01:47:15.162 --> 01:47:15.595
TRAINS TO DEAL WITH THE

01:47:15.662 --> 01:47:17.230
STROLLER AND A BACK AN INFANT.

01:47:17.297 --> 01:47:19.065
THAT MAKES YOU THINK TWICE

01:47:19.132 --> 01:47:21.134
ABOUT DOING IT. AND SO I THINK

01:47:21.201 --> 01:47:22.969
WE ALL NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT

01:47:23.036 --> 01:47:23.570
THOSE SPEEDS ARE WHAT WILL

01:47:23.637 --> 01:47:25.005
REALLY INCREASE RIDERSHIP AND

01:47:25.071 --> 01:47:27.040
JUST SAY IF WE DO THIS WE

01:47:27.107 --> 01:47:29.042
DOUBLE THE RIDERSHIP WELL WHAT

01:47:29.109 --> 01:47:29.709
ARE WE COMPARING THAT TO WE'RE

01:47:29.776 --> 01:47:33.046
OBVIOUSLY NOT DOING NOTHING

01:47:33.113 --> 01:47:33.680
YOU'RE ON. INSTRUCTION WE WANT

01:47:33.747 --> 01:47:37.017
THAT CONSTRUCTION TO BE

01:47:37.083 --> 01:47:37.584
COMPLETED NO ONE IS TALKING

01:47:37.651 --> 01:47:41.221
ABOUT WALKING AWAY FROM THAT.

01:47:41.288 --> 01:47:41.855
HAVING A- BRAIN THAT'S SEPARATE

01:47:41.922 --> 01:47:43.023
HAVING PASSENGER TRAIN THAT

01:47:43.089 --> 01:47:43.623
SEPARATE FROM. RAIL TRAIN IS

01:47:43.690 --> 01:47:44.191
VERY IMPORTANT MAKING THESE

01:47:44.257 --> 01:47:45.292
IMPROVEMENTS IS IMPORTANT BUT

01:47:45.358 --> 01:47:47.260
HOW DO WE HAVE A- EXPERIENCE

01:47:47.327 --> 01:47:47.961
THAT GETS THE MOST PEOPLE ON TO

01:47:48.028 --> 01:47:49.763
THE TRAIN. IS WHAT I'M GOING TO

01:47:49.830 --> 01:47:51.698
CONTINUE TO ASK ABOUT AND WHAT

01:47:51.765 --> 01:47:53.133
IS THE- BASS LINE YOU'RE

01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:53.767
COMPARING IT TO AND NO ONE IS.

01:47:53.834 --> 01:47:55.168
I'VE HEARD PEOPLE SAY WE WERE

01:47:55.235 --> 01:47:56.937
BANNED IN THIS PROJECT I DON'T

01:47:57.003 --> 01:47:57.537
THINK ANYONE'S TALKING ABOUT

01:47:57.604 --> 01:47:59.172
WALKING WHEN ABANDONING ANY OF

01:47:59.239 --> 01:48:01.641
THE INVESTMENTS. THAT BEEN MADE

01:48:01.708 --> 01:48:02.108
OR STOPPING ANY THOSE

01:48:02.175 --> 01:48:06.213
INVESTMENTS. SO IF I MAY THOUGH

01:48:06.279 --> 01:48:09.316
I MEAN. HERE WE STAND AT WHERE

01:48:09.382 --> 01:48:11.318
THE HIGH RAIL STATION WILL BE

01:48:11.384 --> 01:48:13.019
AND- INTO A KNOWLEDGE THAT ARE.

01:48:13.086 --> 01:48:15.088
RAIL LINE IS ROUGHLY A MILE

01:48:15.155 --> 01:48:17.424
PLUS FROM HERE. IT WILL BE

01:48:17.490 --> 01:48:18.959
THROWAWAY COSTS IF WHAT YOU ARE

01:48:19.025 --> 01:48:19.426
SUGGESTING NEEDS TO BE

01:48:19.492 --> 01:48:21.328
FOLLOWED. SO I THINK THERE IS

01:48:21.394 --> 01:48:23.230
QUITE A BIT OF DISCUSSION THAT

01:48:23.296 --> 01:48:23.797
NEEDS TO BE HAD BEFORE YOU

01:48:23.864 --> 01:48:25.365
GUYS. SEAMLESSLY SAY THAT

01:48:25.432 --> 01:48:28.935
THERE'S A TRANSITION TO DIESEL.

01:48:29.002 --> 01:48:29.436
OR THAT THAT'S EVEN A

01:48:29.502 --> 01:48:31.171
CONVERSATION THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:48:31.238 --> 01:48:33.106
HAD IN THIS MOMENT. I THINK

01:48:33.173 --> 01:48:33.707
WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION

01:48:33.773 --> 01:48:35.542
BEFORE AND IT'S ROBBING PETER

01:48:35.609 --> 01:48:37.210
TO PAY PAUL. AND I THINK WE

01:48:37.277 --> 01:48:39.379
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN

01:48:39.446 --> 01:48:41.414
DELIVER ON A PROJECT AS SOON AS

01:48:41.481 --> 01:48:43.583
POSSIBLE. AND WOULD LIKE. THAT

01:48:43.650 --> 01:48:44.985
TO BE THE FOCUS OF WHERE WE

01:48:45.051 --> 01:48:45.552
GET. LET ME JUST ASK MISTER

01:48:45.619 --> 01:48:47.654
CURTAIN I MEAN WHAT WHAT WOULD

01:48:47.721 --> 01:48:49.189
WE PIECE OF THROWING I MEAN

01:48:49.256 --> 01:48:51.358
WHAT. I THINK THAT WERE VERY

01:48:51.424 --> 01:48:53.093
DIFFERENT THINGS ABOUT WHAT

01:48:53.159 --> 01:48:53.693
PEOPLE ARE INVESTING WHAT THE

01:48:53.760 --> 01:49:01.034
SUGGESTION IS. I'M NOT SURE.

01:49:01.101 --> 01:49:01.601
FIRST OF ALL I REALLY WOULD

01:49:01.668 --> 01:49:02.869
LIKE TO HEAR FROM SOME OF THE

01:49:02.936 --> 01:49:03.503
OTHERS ON THIS BUT I'M NOT SURE

01:49:03.570 --> 01:49:05.005
WHAT REFERENCE TO THROWING WAY

01:49:05.071 --> 01:49:05.639
COST YOU MAY HAVE COMPARED TO

01:49:05.705 --> 01:49:07.274
THE SORT OF ENGINEERING- THE

01:49:07.340 --> 01:49:11.044
TRACKING SYSTEMS ISSUES UP THIS

01:49:11.111 --> 01:49:11.645
IS MADE OF VERY VERY COSTLY

01:49:11.711 --> 01:49:15.181
PROJECT- AS AGAIN ASSEMBLY

01:49:15.248 --> 01:49:15.849
WOMAN FRIEDMAN SAID IT'S BEEN

01:49:15.916 --> 01:49:17.350
RARE THAT WE HAVE DONE- NOT

01:49:17.417 --> 01:49:19.219
USED ALL OF THE CONTINGENCIES

01:49:19.286 --> 01:49:20.954
ON OUR COSTS THERE ARE CONSTANT

01:49:21.021 --> 01:49:23.390
PROBLEMS. THE REAL ISSUE IS

01:49:23.456 --> 01:49:25.325
WHAT'S THE BEST INVESTMENT USE

01:49:25.392 --> 01:49:27.260
OF OUR MONEY THEY AMOUNT WE

01:49:27.327 --> 01:49:30.964
HAVE WILL BE THE BEST RETURN

01:49:31.031 --> 01:49:32.832
FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OF

01:49:32.899 --> 01:49:33.433
COURSE IT WILL BE THROWN AWAY

01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:35.535
COST I THINK YOU'LL BE THROWING

01:49:35.602 --> 01:49:37.237
COST EITHER WAY YOU GO- YOU

01:49:37.304 --> 01:49:39.039
KNOW YOU CAN ELECTRIFY STE-

01:49:39.105 --> 01:49:41.441
TRACKS THAT ARE NOT ELECTRIFIED

01:49:41.508 --> 01:49:43.043
THEY'RE DOING IT IN THE

01:49:43.109 --> 01:49:45.111
PENINSULA. IT'S WHETHER YOU DO

01:49:45.178 --> 01:49:47.047
IT NOW AND YOU PUT THAT OUT FOR

01:49:47.113 --> 01:49:49.316
COSTS TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS

01:49:49.382 --> 01:49:51.184
BEFORE YOU NEED ELECTRIC TRAIN

01:49:51.251 --> 01:49:52.819
TO PROVE THAT YOU CAN DO IT

01:49:52.886 --> 01:49:55.021
THAT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO

01:49:55.088 --> 01:49:56.957
ME THAT THAT WILL NOT ATTRACT

01:49:57.023 --> 01:49:57.490
INVESTORS THAT WILL MAKE

01:49:57.557 --> 01:49:59.259
INVESTORS THINK THEY STILL

01:49:59.326 --> 01:50:01.161
HAVEN'T GOTTEN TOGETHER ABOUT

01:50:01.227 --> 01:50:03.363
HOW TO BUILD THE TRAIN TERMS TO

01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:04.030
GET PEOPLE ON THAT TRACK THAT'S

01:50:04.097 --> 01:50:06.967
THE WAY I VIEW NO MATTER OTHER

01:50:07.033 --> 01:50:09.369
PEOPLE. INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR

01:50:09.436 --> 01:50:12.906
MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW.

01:50:12.973 --> 01:50:15.141
CERTAINLY DIDN'T COME HERE TO

01:50:15.208 --> 01:50:15.742
HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE

01:50:15.809 --> 01:50:16.309
GOVERNOR'S COMMENTS. I READ

01:50:16.376 --> 01:50:17.143
THIS IN FACT IN THE FRESNO BEE.

01:50:17.210 --> 01:50:17.711
IT WAS A LITTLE DISTURBING I

01:50:17.777 --> 01:50:18.345
THINK THEY MISSED CHARACTERIZED

01:50:18.411 --> 01:50:19.245
THE REAL ISSUES HERE. SO AGAIN

01:50:19.312 --> 01:50:20.981
WE COULD GO BACK AND FORTH AND-

01:50:21.047 --> 01:50:23.216
CHARM AS- SHE- KELLY AND I.

01:50:23.283 --> 01:50:25.318
COULD DO THIS FOR A WHILE- AND

01:50:25.385 --> 01:50:27.487
I'M ASSUMING WE CAN ALL DO THAT

01:50:27.554 --> 01:50:29.189
BUT I'D- I'D REALLY LIKE TO

01:50:29.255 --> 01:50:29.823
HEAR FROM. MY MOTHER'S HAPPY TO

01:50:29.889 --> 01:50:32.959
MOVE FORWARD. HELLO CHRISTY.

01:50:33.026 --> 01:50:35.195
HEARING MEMBERS THANK YOU SO

01:50:35.261 --> 01:50:35.829
MUCH FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK

01:50:35.895 --> 01:50:37.130
TO YOU TODAY I HAVE THREE MAIN

01:50:37.197 --> 01:50:37.764
POINTS I WANT TO DISCOVER VERY

01:50:37.831 --> 01:50:39.466
QUICKLY I. AM OF THEM HAVE BEEN

01:50:39.532 --> 01:50:40.967
TOUCHED ON BY PREVIOUS SPEAKERS

01:50:41.034 --> 01:50:41.568
AT ONE OF THE LABOR THEM TOO

01:50:41.634 --> 01:50:43.336
MUCH. I THE FIRST ONE IS REALLY

01:50:43.403 --> 01:50:45.105
ABOUT THE PROJECTS FUNDING

01:50:45.171 --> 01:50:47.440
SITUATION SO AS YOU KNOW THAT

01:50:47.507 --> 01:50:48.041
YOU'VE HEARD FROM SOME OF THE

01:50:48.108 --> 01:50:49.342
OTHER- PENALIZED- THE PROJECT

01:50:49.409 --> 01:50:51.077
DOES FACE A SIGNIFICANT FUNDING

01:50:51.144 --> 01:50:51.544
GAP SO RIGHT NOW THE

01:50:51.611 --> 01:50:53.380
AUTHORITIES ESTIMATING IT. WILL

01:50:53.446 --> 01:50:55.215
HAVE APPROXIMATELY THE AMOUNT

01:50:55.281 --> 01:50:55.882
TO DO THE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD

01:50:55.949 --> 01:50:57.417
MINE- BUT WE'RE ABOUT PROBABLY

01:50:57.484 --> 01:50:59.452
BY THEIR ESTIMATES ABOUT SIXTY

01:50:59.519 --> 01:51:01.321
BILLION SHORTEN THE FULL PHASE

01:51:01.388 --> 01:51:03.256
ONE. SO I THERE IS THERE IS

01:51:03.323 --> 01:51:05.258
REFERENCE THAT MAYBE THERE

01:51:05.325 --> 01:51:05.859
COULD BE TAPPING INTO SOME

01:51:05.925 --> 01:51:07.327
ADDITIONAL FUNDS BUT AT THIS

01:51:07.394 --> 01:51:09.029
POINT IT'S UNCLEAR WHERE THOSE

01:51:09.095 --> 01:51:11.164
WOULD COME FROM- AND WE DO KNOW

01:51:11.231 --> 01:51:11.798
THAT THERE IS A RISK THAT THIS

01:51:11.865 --> 01:51:13.366
FUNDING GAP COULD GROW- THIS

01:51:13.433 --> 01:51:16.870
PROJECT HAS EXPERIENCED- FIND-

01:51:16.936 --> 01:51:17.504
COST INCREASES IN THE PAST AS

01:51:17.570 --> 01:51:19.305
YOU'VE HEARD. US SO THAT COULD

01:51:19.372 --> 01:51:21.274
BE A PROBLEM AS WELL IS. THERE

01:51:21.341 --> 01:51:21.808
SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE

01:51:21.875 --> 01:51:23.176
FEDERAL FUNDS- WE TALKED A

01:51:23.243 --> 01:51:25.111
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT- THE

01:51:25.178 --> 01:51:28.882
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS HAS-

01:51:28.948 --> 01:51:29.416
RAISE THE POSSIBILITY OF

01:51:29.482 --> 01:51:35.121
WITHHOLDING- THERE ARE THREE.

01:51:35.188 --> 01:51:35.655
POINT FIVE BILLION AND RE

01:51:35.722 --> 01:51:41.061
SENDING SENDING THOSE FUNDS. SO

01:51:41.127 --> 01:51:42.962
THE SECOND MAIN POINT I WANTED

01:51:43.029 --> 01:51:43.596
TO MAKE- WHICH HAS BEEN TOUCHED

01:51:43.663 --> 01:51:45.165
ON AS WELL IS THAT. REALLY THE

01:51:45.231 --> 01:51:45.765
LEGISLATURE HAS. OPTIONS FOR

01:51:45.832 --> 01:51:47.233
MOVING FORWARD SO CERTAINLY

01:51:47.300 --> 01:51:47.867
MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD IS ONE I

01:51:47.934 --> 01:51:48.902
THINK THIS IS A REALLY. VERY

01:51:48.968 --> 01:51:49.369
HELPFUL IN PRODUCTIVE

01:51:49.436 --> 01:51:49.903
CONVERSATION TO HAVE ABOUT

01:51:49.969 --> 01:51:50.503
WHETHER THAT'S THEIR APPROACH

01:51:50.570 --> 01:51:51.438
THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO TAKE-

01:51:51.504 --> 01:51:53.306
OR WHETHER IT WANTS TO FIND

01:51:53.373 --> 01:51:53.840
SOMETHING ELSE SO WE COULD

01:51:53.907 --> 01:51:55.375
FIND. A SMALLER. PORTION IS

01:51:55.442 --> 01:51:57.177
INITIAL CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT

01:51:57.243 --> 01:51:59.212
TIED IN. WITH YOU A LONGER

01:51:59.279 --> 01:51:59.679
SECTION- YOU COULD DO

01:51:59.746 --> 01:52:01.448
ELECTRIFIED. RAIL AS WE TALKED

01:52:01.514 --> 01:52:03.316
ABOUT YOU COULD DO DIESEL YOU

01:52:03.383 --> 01:52:05.185
COULD DO SOME OTHER

01:52:05.251 --> 01:52:07.020
ALTERNATIVE- TECHNOLOGY AS WELL

01:52:07.087 --> 01:52:07.687
THAT HAD. YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN

01:52:07.754 --> 01:52:09.322
PILING. PILOTING OF OTHER TYPES

01:52:09.389 --> 01:52:11.224
OF TECHNOLOGY SO THERE'S A WIDE

01:52:11.291 --> 01:52:12.992
RANGE OF THINGS THAT COULD BE

01:52:13.059 --> 01:52:13.660
CONSIDERED- WE THINK THAT THOSE

01:52:13.726 --> 01:52:15.161
CONVERSATIONS ARE REALLY

01:52:15.228 --> 01:52:15.795
PRODUCTIVE MANNER AND ARE VERY

01:52:15.862 --> 01:52:17.464
HAPPY THAT THE- THAT THEY'RE

01:52:17.530 --> 01:52:18.031
TAKING PLACE. AND THEN THE

01:52:18.098 --> 01:52:19.365
FINAL POINT I JUST WANT TO MAKE

01:52:19.432 --> 01:52:21.134
IS THAT. WE THINK THIS IS

01:52:21.201 --> 01:52:21.701
REALLY A CRITICAL DECISION

01:52:21.768 --> 01:52:24.938
POINT FOR THE LEGISLATURE- I

01:52:25.004 --> 01:52:27.307
SET. LEGISLATURE IS GONNA MOVE

01:52:27.373 --> 01:52:28.908
FORWARD- AS CURRENTLY PLANNED

01:52:28.975 --> 01:52:29.542
WE THINK THROUGH THE SOONER THE

01:52:29.609 --> 01:52:31.144
AUTHORITY HAVE THAT CERTAINTY

01:52:31.211 --> 01:52:33.146
THE BETTER- AND IF NOT. REALLY

01:52:33.213 --> 01:52:35.381
MAKING THIS CHOICE NOW RATHER

01:52:35.448 --> 01:52:37.250
THAN LATER I THINK IS ALSO VERY

01:52:37.317 --> 01:52:37.851
VALUABLE SO THE AUTHORITY FOR

01:52:37.917 --> 01:52:39.419
EXAMPLE HAS INDICATED. THAT

01:52:39.486 --> 01:52:41.354
THEY MAY MOVE FORWARD WITH

01:52:41.421 --> 01:52:42.989
PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS AS SOON

01:52:43.056 --> 01:52:43.556
AS NEXT YEAR. ADDITIONALLY

01:52:43.623 --> 01:52:45.358
THEIR PLANS TO MOVE FORWARD

01:52:45.425 --> 01:52:46.993
WITH A TRACKING SYSTEMS

01:52:47.060 --> 01:52:49.095
PROCUREMENT- WE UNDERSTAND IN

01:52:49.162 --> 01:52:51.331
THE SUMMER. SO THAT WILL BE AT

01:52:51.397 --> 01:52:52.999
A PRETTY. GET PROCUREMENT WILL

01:52:53.066 --> 01:52:55.235
INVOLVE PURCHASING. THEY

01:52:55.301 --> 01:52:55.835
ELECTRIFIED TRACK AND HAVING

01:52:55.902 --> 01:52:58.972
THAT- THAT CONTRACT IN PLACE.

01:52:59.038 --> 01:52:59.606
AND ALSO A MAINTENANCE CONTRACT

01:52:59.672 --> 01:53:01.274
AS PART OF THAT AS- WELL. AND

01:53:01.341 --> 01:53:03.143
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THE STATE

01:53:03.209 --> 01:53:03.743
WERE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT

01:53:03.810 --> 01:53:05.178
CONTRACT AND IF IT. WERE TO

01:53:05.245 --> 01:53:07.347
MOVE FORWARD WITH THESE

01:53:07.413 --> 01:53:09.149
PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS- IT'S

01:53:09.215 --> 01:53:09.816
GONNA MAKE IT PROBABLY A LITTLE

01:53:09.883 --> 01:53:11.384
BIT MORE CHALLENGING FOR THE

01:53:11.451 --> 01:53:13.319
STATE TO. CHANGE COURSE IN THE

01:53:13.386 --> 01:53:13.853
FUTURE IF THAT. IF THAT

01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:16.789
DECISION THE LATE LEGISLATURE

01:53:16.856 --> 01:53:17.323
MAKES AT A FUTURE DATE FOR

01:53:17.390 --> 01:53:19.159
EXAMPLE. SO WE THINK IT'S

01:53:19.225 --> 01:53:19.792
REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT REALLY

01:53:19.859 --> 01:53:20.360
GOOD THAT WE'RE HAVING THESE

01:53:20.426 --> 01:53:21.461
CONVERSATIONS NOW THEY'RE- NOT

01:53:21.528 --> 01:53:23.329
EASY CONVERSATION THERE A LOT

01:53:23.396 --> 01:53:25.231
OF TRADE OFFS AS WE- AS WE

01:53:25.298 --> 01:53:27.066
DISCUSSED ON. BUT WE THINK IT'S

01:53:27.133 --> 01:53:29.002
REALLY VALUABLE TO HAVE THIS

01:53:29.068 --> 01:53:29.636
BACK AND FORTH AND REALLY THINK

01:53:29.702 --> 01:53:31.237
THROUGH. IS THAT THROUGH THE

01:53:31.304 --> 01:53:38.945
STATE. THERE ARE PLEASE.

CONTACT GETTING THINGS. IN PROP

ONE NAY. ASSEMBLY WOMAN

01:53:49.155 --> 01:53:51.558
FRIEDMAN I APPRECIATE BEING

01:53:51.624 --> 01:53:52.091

01:53:52.158 --> 01:53:55.495
INVITATION. I'LL TRY TO BE

01:53:55.562 --> 01:53:58.898
BRIEF- SAVE TIME FOR QUESTIONS

01:53:58.965 --> 01:53:59.465
AS WELL I DO WANT TO MAKE A

01:53:59.532 --> 01:54:01.067
COUPLE OF BRIEF POINTS FIRST. I

01:54:01.134 --> 01:54:03.536
AM CONCERNED THAT THE HIGH

01:54:03.603 --> 01:54:05.405
LEVEL OF THIS DISCUSSION WE NOT

01:54:05.471 --> 01:54:06.806
FORGET THAT WE'VE GOT TO BUILD

01:54:06.873 --> 01:54:09.342
TRACKS BETWEEN MADERA AND

01:54:09.409 --> 01:54:11.477
POPLAR AVENUE. THAT IS THE

01:54:11.544 --> 01:54:13.279
REQUIREMENTS OF THE FEDERAL

01:54:13.346 --> 01:54:15.248
MONEY AND THAT IS IF WE DO NOT

01:54:15.315 --> 01:54:17.450
DO THAT EXPOSE OURSELVES TO A

01:54:17.517 --> 01:54:20.987
REAL LIABILITY- ESPECIALLY IF

01:54:21.054 --> 01:54:22.989
THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. IS

01:54:23.056 --> 01:54:25.525
REELECTED I THINK THEY WILL DO

01:54:25.592 --> 01:54:27.160
NO FAVORS TO CALIFORNIA AND IF

01:54:27.227 --> 01:54:29.229
WE EXPOSE OURSELVES SO BE HAPPY

01:54:29.295 --> 01:54:31.064
TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN. OF OUR

01:54:31.130 --> 01:54:32.999
LETTER IN THIS REGARD OUR

01:54:33.066 --> 01:54:35.101
LETTER OF THE AUGUST THE TWENTY

01:54:35.168 --> 01:54:37.036
THIRD EXPRESSED A CONCERN ABOUT

01:54:37.103 --> 01:54:39.339
THE- THE- PROPOSAL BY THE

01:54:39.405 --> 01:54:41.241
AUTHORITY TO ISSUE A SINGLE

01:54:41.307 --> 01:54:43.309
CONTRACT IT WILL COVER

01:54:43.376 --> 01:54:44.911
ESSENTIALLY EVERYTHING FROM.

01:54:44.978 --> 01:54:47.547
HERE TO SAN FRANCISCO WE THINK

01:54:47.614 --> 01:54:49.048
THAT POSES A REAL DANGER TO THE

01:54:49.115 --> 01:54:51.618
SIMPLE JOB OF GETTING THE TRACK

01:54:51.684 --> 01:54:53.119
WORK DONE. SO THIS SHOULD NOT

01:54:53.186 --> 01:54:55.021
THEY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED VERY

01:54:55.088 --> 01:54:58.992
CAREFULLY AND I THINK OF A REAL

01:54:59.058 --> 01:54:59.592
DELIBERATE DECISIONS SHOULD BE

01:54:59.659 --> 01:55:03.363
MADE. IN OUR PAST LETTERS IN IN

01:55:03.429 --> 01:55:04.030
TESTIMONY WE'VE STRESSED TO THE

01:55:04.097 --> 01:55:05.331
LEGISLATURE THAT YOU HAVE

01:55:05.398 --> 01:55:05.932
OPTIONS THERE'S NOT JUST ONE

01:55:05.999 --> 01:55:06.532
CHOICE ON THE TABLE THERE ARE

01:55:06.599 --> 01:55:09.602
OPTIONS. REALLY RIGHT NOW OF

01:55:09.669 --> 01:55:11.170
THE TWO OPTIONS THAT YOU'RE

01:55:11.237 --> 01:55:13.239
LOOKING AT WOULD BE ONE TO HAVE

01:55:13.306 --> 01:55:15.141
A KIND OF A CONVENTIONAL SYSTEM

01:55:15.208 --> 01:55:17.243
AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND THEN

01:55:17.310 --> 01:55:19.245
SHIFT MONEY TO THE ENDS. AS

01:55:19.312 --> 01:55:21.414
OPPOSED TO HAVING THE OF FULL

01:55:21.481 --> 01:55:24.917
HIGH SPEED SYSTEM FROM MERCED

01:55:24.984 --> 01:55:25.451
TO OF BAKERSFIELD. ONLINE

01:55:25.518 --> 01:55:29.055
FOCUSING ON THAT. IN SUMMARY

01:55:29.122 --> 01:55:30.923
TERMS THE ADVANTAGE OF THE

01:55:30.990 --> 01:55:33.426
FULLY ELECTRIFIED- APPROACHES

01:55:33.493 --> 01:55:34.027
THAT YOU YOU WOULD BUILD HIGH

01:55:34.093 --> 01:55:37.163
SPEED RAIL AND YOU WOULD

01:55:37.230 --> 01:55:37.764
DEMONSTRATE TRAIN TRAVELING AT

01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:39.465
HIGH SPEED. OF BUT I THINK IT

01:55:39.532 --> 01:55:41.167
WOULD BE LESS LOGICAL TO DO

01:55:41.234 --> 01:55:43.069
THIS ANALYST THIS ALSO IMPLIES

01:55:43.136 --> 01:55:45.171
A FULL COMMITMENT BY THE STATE

01:55:45.238 --> 01:55:47.507
TO FINISH THE SYSTEM. IT WOULD

01:55:47.573 --> 01:55:48.908
NOT MAKE A LOT OF SENSE TO

01:55:48.975 --> 01:55:51.077
COMMIT TO BUILDING JUST HIGH

01:55:51.144 --> 01:55:51.644
SPEED RAIL IN THE CENTRAL

01:55:51.711 --> 01:55:53.446
VALLEY WITHOUT BEING COMMITTED

01:55:53.513 --> 01:55:53.980
TO GOING ON FROM THERE AND

01:55:54.047 --> 01:55:57.183
FINISHING THE SYSTEM. AND I

01:55:57.250 --> 01:55:57.817
WOULD ADD THERE IS NO FUNDING

01:55:57.884 --> 01:56:01.187
IN PLACE TO DO THAT. IN THIS IS

01:56:01.254 --> 01:56:03.256
BEEN A REPEATED PROBLEM OF THE

01:56:03.323 --> 01:56:05.458
PROJECT AND IT IS ONE WHICH

01:56:05.525 --> 01:56:07.160
REALLY SHOULDN'T BE- SWEPT

01:56:07.226 --> 01:56:09.228
UNDER THE RUG. THE LEGISLATURE

01:56:09.295 --> 01:56:11.364
NEEDS TO CONFRONT THIS ISSUE OF

01:56:11.431 --> 01:56:12.965
IF YOU REALLY ARE GOING TO

01:56:13.032 --> 01:56:15.201
BUILD A SYSTEM. THEN THE

01:56:15.268 --> 01:56:15.735
OPTIONS FOR FINANCING THE

01:56:15.802 --> 01:56:18.938
SYSTEM SHOULD BE EXPLORED IN

01:56:19.005 --> 01:56:19.539
AND THE DENNIS FIGHT IF YOU

01:56:19.605 --> 01:56:21.507
CAN. THE ADVANTAGE OF THE OTHER

01:56:21.574 --> 01:56:23.576
OF PROVED AS IT WOULD PROVIDE

01:56:23.643 --> 01:56:24.977
IMPROVE SERVICE- AND THE

01:56:25.044 --> 01:56:27.146
CENTRAL VALLEY OVER WHAT YOU

01:56:27.213 --> 01:56:28.848
HAVE NOW. BUT AT THE SAME TIME

01:56:28.915 --> 01:56:31.217
GENERATE LARGE BENEFITS TO THE

01:56:31.284 --> 01:56:33.453
PASSENGERS ON PATROL LINK AND

01:56:33.519 --> 01:56:34.887
CALTRAIN IN THE NEAR TERM.

01:56:34.954 --> 01:56:37.390
THERE WAS ALWAYS THIS QUESTION

01:56:37.457 --> 01:56:38.024
OF WHETHER YOU SHOULD START AT

01:56:38.091 --> 01:56:39.158
THE ENDS AND BILL TOWARD THE

01:56:39.225 --> 01:56:39.792
MIDDLE OR START IN THE MIDDLE

01:56:39.859 --> 01:56:41.294
AND I DON'T TO WHERE THE ENDS.

01:56:41.361 --> 01:56:43.363
AND THAT IS STILL THE OPTION

01:56:43.429 --> 01:56:45.198
THAT'S BEFORE US I THINK

01:56:45.264 --> 01:56:45.832
THERE'S NO QUESTION BUT WHAT

01:56:45.898 --> 01:56:47.367
SPENDING MONEY ON THE ENDS

01:56:47.433 --> 01:56:49.202
GENERATES MORE IMMEDIATE

01:56:49.268 --> 01:56:51.104
BENEFITS THAN SPENDING MONEY IN

01:56:51.170 --> 01:56:53.072
THE MIDDLE. IN THE LONG RUN IT

01:56:53.139 --> 01:56:55.141
DOESN'T MATTER AS LONG AS

01:56:55.208 --> 01:56:55.742
YOU'RE COMMITTED TO FINISHING

01:56:55.808 --> 01:56:57.377
THE SYSTEM. IN ANY EVENT THERE

01:56:57.443 --> 01:57:00.947
ARE UNCERTAINTIES CAN BOTH

01:57:01.013 --> 01:57:03.116
OPTIONS INCLUDING COST SCHEDULE

01:57:03.182 --> 01:57:05.051
AND SCOPE THERE IS STILL WIDE

01:57:05.118 --> 01:57:07.153
RANGE OF VARIATION ON EXPECTED

01:57:07.220 --> 01:57:09.322
COST. OF TIMES TO COMPLETELY.

01:57:09.389 --> 01:57:11.190
AND THERE WILL BE WIDE

01:57:11.257 --> 01:57:13.025
VARIATIONS ON DEMAND FORECAST

01:57:13.092 --> 01:57:15.128
NO MATTER WHO DOES THEM AND HOW

01:57:15.194 --> 01:57:17.563
THEY DO. THAT THAT DAY OR AT

01:57:17.630 --> 01:57:19.132
THE DATA DO NOT EXIST. IN THIS

01:57:19.198 --> 01:57:21.167
IS A GREEN FIELD SITUATIONS

01:57:21.234 --> 01:57:22.869
VITAL THAT WE'RE FACING SO.

01:57:22.935 --> 01:57:25.338
WHERE IS DONE WILL BE SUBJECT

01:57:25.405 --> 01:57:29.208
TO REAL UNCERTAINTY. ALL I

01:57:29.275 --> 01:57:31.110
THINK THEREFORE WE SHOULD FOCUS

01:57:31.177 --> 01:57:31.677
ON THIS FACT THAT IF WE GET

01:57:31.744 --> 01:57:33.279
THERE ARE WERE DONE ON TIME

01:57:33.346 --> 01:57:35.047
THERE IS NO REASON TO BE IN A

01:57:35.114 --> 01:57:37.250
HURRY ABOUT THE OTHER DECISIONS

01:57:37.316 --> 01:57:39.152
THAT NEED TO BE MADE. WE CAN

01:57:39.218 --> 01:57:41.220
TAKE OUR TIME WE CAN HAVE THE

01:57:41.287 --> 01:57:43.089
OPTIONS TO FIND CAREFULLY WE

01:57:43.156 --> 01:57:43.689
CAN BE SURE THAT THE NUMBERS

01:57:43.756 --> 01:57:47.193
ARE AS GOOD AS THEY CAN BE. AND

01:57:47.260 --> 01:57:47.760
WE DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH

01:57:47.827 --> 01:57:49.128
QUALITATIVE ARGUMENTS THAT

01:57:49.195 --> 01:57:51.431
ALWAYS CONCERNS ME I WANT TO

01:57:51.497 --> 01:57:53.466
SEE THE BEST ENGINEERING AND

01:57:53.533 --> 01:57:55.568
THE BEST ECONOMIC ANALYSIS IN

01:57:55.635 --> 01:57:58.871
QUANTITATIVE TERMS. I WANT ALL

01:57:58.938 --> 01:58:00.973
IN ONE PLACE BEFORE I WOULD

01:58:01.040 --> 01:58:01.574
RECOMMEND TO YOU THAT YOU MAKE

01:58:01.641 --> 01:58:05.178
ANY DECISION AT ALL. THANK YOU

01:58:05.244 --> 01:58:05.778
MISTER THOMPSON AND I TO LOOK

01:58:05.845 --> 01:58:07.647
FORWARD TO THE QUANTITATIVE

01:58:07.713 --> 01:58:09.248
ANALYSIS IF THERE ARE NO

01:58:09.315 --> 01:58:09.849
QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO NOW MOVE

01:58:09.916 --> 01:58:13.319
ON TO MISTER MORTENSEN. THANK

01:58:13.386 --> 01:58:15.021
YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBER

01:58:15.087 --> 01:58:17.123
FRIEDMAN. THE ETL AND I HAVE A

01:58:17.190 --> 01:58:19.659
RUNNING JOKE ABOUT THIS PROCESS

01:58:19.725 --> 01:58:21.260
BECOMING A BEAUTY PAGEANT. AND

01:58:21.327 --> 01:58:23.229
WE ALWAYS FEEL LIKE WOMEN NOT

01:58:23.296 --> 01:58:24.864
MIGHT NOT BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL

01:58:24.931 --> 01:58:27.266
CONTESTANT WHEN ALL THE- THE

01:58:27.333 --> 01:58:29.168
SCORES ARE AND- WE HAVE TO MAKE

01:58:29.235 --> 01:58:29.669
LIGHT OF IT BECAUSE- THE

01:58:29.735 --> 01:58:31.237
DIFFICULT. LOOKING AT MOVING

01:58:31.304 --> 01:58:33.573
MONEY AROUND THE STATE AND

01:58:33.639 --> 01:58:35.174
COMPETING FOR IT AND THAT

01:58:35.241 --> 01:58:35.775
NONTRADITIONAL WAY THIS ISN'T

01:58:35.842 --> 01:58:37.410
USUALLY HOW WE GO ABOUT- THE

01:58:37.477 --> 01:58:41.080
FUNDING PROCESS. I REPRESENT

01:58:41.147 --> 01:58:43.182
BOTH THE A SERVICE IN THE SAN

01:58:43.249 --> 01:58:47.253
JOAQUIN SAID MANAGE THESE FOR

01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:47.820
TWENTY ONE YEARS IN THE SEMI

01:58:47.887 --> 01:58:49.155
CANS FOR JUST UNDER FIVE. WORK

01:58:49.222 --> 01:58:51.090
SIDE BY SIDE WITH ALL OF THE

01:58:51.157 --> 01:58:51.691
CEOS OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:58:51.757 --> 01:58:53.292
AUTHORITY SINCE MANY MORE

01:58:53.359 --> 01:58:55.728
SHOULD WORK SIDE BY SIDE AND

01:58:55.795 --> 01:58:56.329
FRANKLY OUT RIGHT TALENT THEM

01:58:56.395 --> 01:58:59.198
AT TIMES. IN FULL DISCLOSURE I

01:58:59.265 --> 01:59:02.969
VOTED NO ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:59:03.035 --> 01:59:03.603
BOND NOT BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK

01:59:03.669 --> 01:59:05.271
IT WAS WORTH WHILE. YEAH CAM A

01:59:05.338 --> 01:59:05.872
TRAFFIC ENGINEER WHO IT WAS

01:59:05.938 --> 01:59:09.075
MOVED TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE

01:59:09.141 --> 01:59:09.609
BENEFITS OF RAIL AND ITS

01:59:09.675 --> 01:59:11.244
TRANSFORMATIVE NAY- BUT I

01:59:11.310 --> 01:59:13.212
WORRIED EXACTLY THIS WOULD

01:59:13.279 --> 01:59:15.615
HAPPEN IN CALIFORNIA WOULD

01:59:15.681 --> 01:59:17.383
STRUGGLE TO PULL THAT OFF AND-

01:59:17.450 --> 01:59:19.752
YOU KNOW I GRIND MY HANDS AND

01:59:19.819 --> 01:59:21.320
HAVE A BATTLE OF CONSCIENCE ALL

01:59:21.387 --> 01:59:23.289
THE TIME. IN MY ROLE ON THIS ON

01:59:23.356 --> 01:59:25.258
THE PEER REVIEW GROUP AND THEN

01:59:25.324 --> 01:59:26.959
AS NOW IN THE SEARCH THIS AND

01:59:27.026 --> 01:59:29.095
THEN AFTER THE VOTERS DID VOTE

01:59:29.161 --> 01:59:29.762
FOR IT I FEEL AN OBLIGATION AS

01:59:29.829 --> 01:59:31.264
A BIRTH CONTROL TO PURSUE THAT

01:59:31.330 --> 01:59:35.301
EVEN THOUGH. PERSONALLY YOU

01:59:35.368 --> 01:59:37.169
KNOW I HAD MY DOUBT. IS A

01:59:37.236 --> 01:59:39.138
WATERSHED PROJECT AND IT WILL

01:59:39.205 --> 01:59:41.073
MEAN A LOT AROUND THE STATE AND

01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:41.541
IT NEEDS TO GET BUILT

01:59:41.607 --> 01:59:43.142
EVERYWHERE IT WAS PLANNED.

01:59:43.209 --> 01:59:44.877
HOWEVER I'M NOT PLEASE GOTTEN

01:59:44.944 --> 01:59:47.313
HOW THE AUTHORITY IS GETTING

01:59:47.380 --> 01:59:49.248
THERE AND SO ARE YOU DO

01:59:49.315 --> 01:59:49.882
STRUGGLE WITH SOME OF THE OTHER

01:59:49.949 --> 01:59:53.052
PLAYERS ON THE PANEL. I JUST

01:59:53.119 --> 01:59:55.187
DON'T THINK THE LARGEST PROJECT

01:59:55.254 --> 01:59:55.755
OVER TIME SHOULD BE SUCH A

01:59:55.821 --> 02:00:00.893
ROLLER COASTER RIDE. BACK I CAN

02:00:00.960 --> 02:00:01.494
REMEMBER NOW THE FIRST TIME WE

02:00:01.561 --> 02:00:04.897
SWITCHED AND ZIG AND ZAG- MY

02:00:04.964 --> 02:00:06.899
REGION WAS A LITTLE DISMAYED

02:00:06.966 --> 02:00:07.500
BECAUSE THE FIRST CONNECTION

02:00:07.567 --> 02:00:09.402
WAS GOING TO BE BUILT TO

02:00:09.468 --> 02:00:11.137
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT DÂN

02:00:11.203 --> 02:00:11.737
LIVE IN AND I RAMPED UP OUR

02:00:11.804 --> 02:00:13.239
REGION TO BE EXCITED ABOUT THE-

02:00:13.306 --> 02:00:15.274
CONNECTION TO SOUTHERN

02:00:15.341 --> 02:00:17.310
CALIFORNIA FROM THE VALLEY. WAS

02:00:17.376 --> 02:00:19.345
IMPORTANT IT WAS ONE OF THE

02:00:19.412 --> 02:00:19.946
TWO. OTHER LEGS OF OUR SCHOOL

02:00:20.012 --> 02:00:23.115
BAY AREA SACRAMENTO IS ONE

02:00:23.182 --> 02:00:23.749
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS ANOTHER

02:00:23.816 --> 02:00:25.217
ECONOMICALLY FOR FAMILY AND SO

02:00:25.284 --> 02:00:27.453
WE RALLIED AROUND THAT CHOICE

02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:29.255
AND WE HAD OUR REGION SUPPORT

02:00:29.322 --> 02:00:34.961
THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY.

02:00:35.027 --> 02:00:35.595
WITH ZAGGED AGAIN NOW NOT GOING

02:00:35.661 --> 02:00:39.365
ON SO. TO THE WEST. ILLEGAL

02:00:39.432 --> 02:00:39.999
PULLED OUR STRAPS UP RIGHT DOWN

02:00:40.066 --> 02:00:41.367
AND WE GOT EVERYONE TO SUPPORT

02:00:41.434 --> 02:00:41.968
THAT MOVE BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE

02:00:42.034 --> 02:00:43.202
OF AFFORDABLE AND WE GET THERE

02:00:43.269 --> 02:00:45.204
SOONER BUT WITH EVERY ZIG AND

02:00:45.271 --> 02:00:47.306
ZAG THE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE HAS

02:00:47.373 --> 02:00:49.408
ERODED AND SO WHEN I GET IT

02:00:49.475 --> 02:00:53.012
HERE NOW AND HERE YOU KNOW THE

02:00:53.079 --> 02:00:53.579
REALLY DIFFICULT THIS TENDS

02:00:53.646 --> 02:00:55.247
WERE HAVING I WORRY ABOUT

02:00:55.314 --> 02:00:57.216
ANOTHER TURN IN THE DIRECTION

02:00:57.283 --> 02:01:00.953
AND HOW WE CARRY THIS OUT IF

02:01:01.020 --> 02:01:03.222
THIS IS THE MODEL WE SAY AGAIN

02:01:03.289 --> 02:01:05.057
SAG. AT SO MANY TURNS NOT THAT

02:01:05.124 --> 02:01:09.095
IMPROVE THE RAIL SYSTEM. GREAT

02:01:09.161 --> 02:01:11.097
FOR THE THEY- LEFT TO ASK FOR

02:01:11.163 --> 02:01:11.697
THE MONEY FOR THE ACE OF THE

02:01:11.764 --> 02:01:12.298
SAND ROCK JOAQUIN ROUTES. BUT

02:01:12.365 --> 02:01:12.898
WE GOT SOME OF THAT

02:01:12.965 --> 02:01:13.466
SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING THROUGH

02:01:13.532 --> 02:01:15.034
THE OTHER STATES SOURCES AND-

02:01:15.101 --> 02:01:15.635
I'M HOPING AND I WOULD WORK

02:01:15.701 --> 02:01:17.303
VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE OF

02:01:17.370 --> 02:01:19.205
THESE. OTHER URBAN PLAYERS ARE

02:01:19.271 --> 02:01:21.474
FIRST IN LINE FOR SOME OF THESE

02:01:21.540 --> 02:01:23.142
OTHER RESOURCES. BUT I WORRY

02:01:23.209 --> 02:01:25.511
THAT IT WOULD VANCE HIGH SPEED

02:01:25.578 --> 02:01:27.246
RAIL IN THE SAME MANNER AND TO

02:01:27.313 --> 02:01:29.048
YOUR POINT ABOUT. DO WE HAVE A

02:01:29.115 --> 02:01:31.083
SPECIFIC GOAL ABOUT THAT I

02:01:31.150 --> 02:01:31.751
THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE EXPLORED

02:01:31.817 --> 02:01:33.252
FURTHER. WE HAVE SOME VERY

02:01:33.319 --> 02:01:37.023
PURIST IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO DO

02:01:37.089 --> 02:01:39.191
IT. AND THEN INSTEAD OF LIKE A

02:01:39.258 --> 02:01:41.360
MIDDLE IDEA WE JUMP TO ANOTHER.

02:01:41.427 --> 02:01:45.064
SIDE I THINK THERE IS A MIDDLE

02:01:45.131 --> 02:01:47.166
THAT WE COULD GET TO I DO

02:01:47.233 --> 02:01:51.037
BELIEVE WE DEMONSTRATE HIGH

02:01:51.103 --> 02:01:51.637
SPEED TRAINS AND DO RUN THREE

02:01:51.704 --> 02:01:55.307
GRAINS. IT'S NOT ON ALL THE

02:01:55.374 --> 02:01:55.908
PERSON WHO DOES NOT THE MODEL

02:01:55.975 --> 02:01:57.309
SOME PEOPLE PREFER. I THINK

02:01:57.376 --> 02:01:57.943
IT'S POSSIBLE AND I THINK IT'S

02:01:58.010 --> 02:01:59.245
WORTH EXPLORING IF IT LETS US

02:01:59.311 --> 02:01:59.845
DO. SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS

02:01:59.912 --> 02:02:00.446
THAT MIGHT MY COLLEAGUES WOULD

02:02:00.513 --> 02:02:03.215
LIKE TO SEE. I THINK MERCED IS.

02:02:03.282 --> 02:02:05.518
A DEAL BREAKER I THINK YOU HAVE

02:02:05.584 --> 02:02:07.186
TO HAVE ONE OF THE ENDS THIS IS

02:02:07.253 --> 02:02:11.057
MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION ONE OF

02:02:11.123 --> 02:02:11.657
THE ENDS OF THE SYSTEM HAS TO

02:02:11.724 --> 02:02:14.860
BE ROBUSTLY. ACTED I THINK I

02:02:14.927 --> 02:02:15.461
COULD FUDGE A LITTLE BIT ON.

02:02:15.528 --> 02:02:17.129
THE SOUTHERN PORTION A LOT OF

02:02:17.196 --> 02:02:19.131
THAT AS BEST CONNECTION FROM

02:02:19.198 --> 02:02:21.133
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. NOT

02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:21.767
WITHSTANDING THE IMPORTANCE OF

02:02:21.834 --> 02:02:23.869
MY CITIES IN THE SOUTHERN

02:02:23.936 --> 02:02:25.104
VALLEY I THINK WE COULD KEEP

02:02:25.171 --> 02:02:27.373
SOME NON COMPETITIVE SAN

02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:29.075
JOAQUIN SERVICE FOR THEM. BUT I

02:02:29.141 --> 02:02:31.410
THINK MERCED. BEING CONNECTED

02:02:31.477 --> 02:02:33.245
AT THAT JUMPING OFF POINT IN

02:02:33.312 --> 02:02:35.147
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA I THINK

02:02:35.214 --> 02:02:37.016
THAT'S CRITICAL BE VERY HARD

02:02:37.083 --> 02:02:37.616
FOR ME TO SUPPORT SOMETHING.

02:02:37.683 --> 02:02:39.251
THAT DOESN'T HAVE THAT. I THINK

02:02:39.318 --> 02:02:41.187
ONE OF THE IDEAS WE'VE COME UP

02:02:41.253 --> 02:02:43.222
WITH. THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR

02:02:43.289 --> 02:02:45.324
IS COMBINING THE SYSTEMS I'M

02:02:45.391 --> 02:02:47.259
INTRIGUED ABOUT THE VIRGIN

02:02:47.326 --> 02:02:49.328
CONCEPT AND I HAVE REACHED OUT

02:02:49.395 --> 02:02:51.097
TO THEM IF THERE'S A WAY TO

02:02:51.163 --> 02:02:53.466
TAKE. A SAID THIS MY CANS AND

02:02:53.532 --> 02:02:55.367
WHATEVER OPERATE THIS FIRST

02:02:55.434 --> 02:02:59.105
SEGMENT AND REGION THE BUSES

02:02:59.171 --> 02:02:59.739
THAT GO TO. IN CALIFORNIA THERE

02:02:59.805 --> 02:03:01.273
WE HAD KIDS THAT WITHOUT. A

02:03:01.340 --> 02:03:04.910
DOUBT. FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR

02:03:04.977 --> 02:03:07.113
SOMETHING MUCH MANAGE MORE

02:03:07.179 --> 02:03:07.680
FUNGIBLE MOVE YOUR PENCIL.

02:03:07.747 --> 02:03:08.180
REVENUE IS AROUND. THE

02:03:08.247 --> 02:03:09.348
PROTECTOR HAS EXPRESSED SOME

02:03:09.415 --> 02:03:11.050
INTEREST BUT THAT TAKES A LOT

02:03:11.117 --> 02:03:15.221
OF COORDINATION. AND A FULL

02:03:15.287 --> 02:03:19.158
SECTION BEING BUILT. BUT JUST

02:03:19.225 --> 02:03:23.329
SAY HAVING SINCE AND WAS PASSED

02:03:23.395 --> 02:03:23.896
IN AND VERY I AM VERY GOOD

02:03:23.963 --> 02:03:25.164
MUSCLES FROM WRINGING MY HANDS

02:03:25.231 --> 02:03:25.798
OVER AND OVER SOMETHING HAS TO

02:03:25.865 --> 02:03:27.099
CHANGE WE NEED A SERIOUS

02:03:27.166 --> 02:03:27.767
SERIOUS LOOK AT HOW WE'RE GOING

02:03:27.833 --> 02:03:29.034
TO GET THERE IT REALLY TAKES A

02:03:29.101 --> 02:03:29.502
LEGISLATURE TO MAKE A

02:03:29.568 --> 02:03:31.036
COMMITMENT LUIS RIGHT WE'VE

02:03:31.103 --> 02:03:33.105
SAID THAT FOR YEARS THERE HAS

02:03:33.172 --> 02:03:33.739
TO BE A COMMITMENT THAT WE'RE

02:03:33.806 --> 02:03:37.042
GOING TO DO IT. OR WE END UP IN

02:03:37.109 --> 02:03:37.676
A PLACE WHERE WE JUST HAVE TO

02:03:37.743 --> 02:03:41.013
GO TO A BUILDING BLOCK SO I'M

02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:43.215
I'M HAPPY THAT YOU ASKED FOR MY

02:03:43.282 --> 02:03:45.050
IMPRESSION IMPRESSION ON THIS

02:03:45.117 --> 02:03:45.684

BUT- OF- THAT- YOU HAD TO HAVE

02:03:55.361 --> 02:03:57.129
A JUMPING OFF POINT IN THAT IS

02:03:57.196 --> 02:03:57.596
A DEAL BREAKER I DON'T

02:03:57.663 --> 02:03:59.131

02:04:03.002 --> 02:04:03.569
POINT I THINK WE'RE SAID FROM

02:04:03.636 --> 02:04:05.437
THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

02:04:05.504 --> 02:04:06.038
PERSPECTIVE IT IS A PLACE BUT

02:04:06.105 --> 02:04:07.072
THERE'S A NATIONAL TRANSIT

02:04:07.139 --> 02:04:09.141
CONNECTIVE ITTY. AND PLANNED

02:04:09.208 --> 02:04:11.143
INITIAL A BUS SERVICE TO WE'RE

02:04:11.210 --> 02:04:13.078
STARTING BUS SERVICE TO SAN

JOSE FROM MERCED. IN

02:04:14.980 --> 02:04:15.548
ANTICIPATION OF HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:04:15.614 --> 02:04:17.149
GETTING THERE. THAT THE A

02:04:17.216 --> 02:04:19.084
SERVICES GOT THE SAN JOAQUIN

02:04:19.151 --> 02:04:19.552
JUST GOT A LOT OF THE

02:04:19.618 --> 02:04:21.120
CONNECTING BUS TO THE COAST AND

TO THE YOU SOMEBODY NATIONAL

02:04:23.455 --> 02:04:25.524
PARK. IF THE JUMPING OFF POINT

02:04:25.591 --> 02:04:27.293
IS THERE SAID FROM THE FIRST

02:04:27.359 --> 02:04:29.128
PIECE INSTEAD AND WE'RE LIMITED

02:04:29.195 --> 02:04:31.197
TO THAT NORTHERN AND- I BELIEVE

02:04:31.263 --> 02:04:34.967
THEN YOU HAVE TO. AND POINTS OF

02:04:35.034 --> 02:04:35.568
THE SERVICE GRANTED YOU WOULD

02:04:35.634 --> 02:04:37.536
HAVE THROUGH TRAINS BUT YOUR

02:04:37.603 --> 02:04:41.207
PORTIONS. AT HIGHER SPEED. ARE

02:04:41.273 --> 02:04:47.313
ARE BOTH. LESS AND METROPOLITAN

02:04:47.379 --> 02:04:47.913

TO SURE SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE

02:04:59.124 --> 02:05:01.026
MAP I'M SUGGESTING THE PEACH

02:05:01.093 --> 02:05:01.560
THAT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

METROLINK BARK OR. CALTRAIN OR

02:13:29.301 --> 02:13:33.038
LA METRO OR ANY OF THESE OTHER.

02:13:33.105 --> 02:13:35.040
IS WE DO NOT HAVE ACCESS. TO

02:13:35.107 --> 02:13:35.674
FUNDING OUTSIDE OF THE FUNDING

02:13:35.741 --> 02:13:37.242
IT'S DEDICATED US IN THE BOND.

02:13:37.309 --> 02:13:38.977
WE GOT ZERO OUT OF SB ONE- IN

02:13:39.044 --> 02:13:39.578
THOUGH THE WERE THOSE FUNDING

02:13:39.644 --> 02:13:41.046
POTS GROW. THERE ARE YEAH WE

02:13:41.113 --> 02:13:41.646
HAVE CAP AND TRADE WE'VE GOT A

02:13:41.713 --> 02:13:43.115
PERCENTAGE OF CAP AND TRADE.

02:13:43.181 --> 02:13:43.682
THAT WE HAVE BUT ASIDE FROM

02:13:43.749 --> 02:13:45.283
THOSE POTS- WE GOT WE DON'T

02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:47.352
HAVE ACCESS TO OTHER FUNDING

02:13:47.419 --> 02:13:49.821
POTS- IN SO THE PROGRAM LIKE

02:13:49.888 --> 02:13:51.123
THE D. I. R. C. PRO. P. PROGRAM

02:13:51.189 --> 02:13:53.325
THAT'S AVAILABLE OTHER TRANSIT

02:13:53.392 --> 02:13:55.160
ENTITIES. IS MADE UP OF TWO.

02:13:55.227 --> 02:13:57.129
FUNDING POPS CAP AND TRADE

02:13:57.195 --> 02:13:57.729
DOLLARS GO TO THE C. T. I. R.

02:13:57.796 --> 02:14:01.133
C. P. PROGRAM. ASIDE WHAT COMES

02:14:01.199 --> 02:14:02.834
ASIDE FROM WHAT STYLES. IN SB

02:14:02.901 --> 02:14:05.203
ONE BOLSTERED THAT PROGRAM AND

02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:07.172
WE DON'T SEE ANY OF THAT. SO

02:14:07.239 --> 02:14:11.009
THE ISSUE IS AGAIN- I'M NOT IN

02:14:11.076 --> 02:14:11.543
IT I'VE NOTICED. WITH THE

02:14:11.610 --> 02:14:15.180
IMPROVEMENTS. THAT METROLINK

02:14:15.247 --> 02:14:18.950
WHAT TAKE I THINK THEY'RE GREAT.

02:14:19.017 --> 02:14:19.551
THEY DID PROVIDE A RESPONSE TO

02:14:19.618 --> 02:14:21.520
US AT A COST OF ABOUT NINE

02:14:21.586 --> 02:14:22.120
POINT EIGHT. MILLION DOLLARS

02:14:22.187 --> 02:14:22.654
FOR A SERIES OF CAPITAL

02:14:22.721 --> 02:14:23.255
PROJECTS THAT. OVER THE NEXT

02:14:23.321 --> 02:14:25.056
TEN YEARS. IF YOU DIVERTED

02:14:25.123 --> 02:14:27.192
EVERY TIME WE HAD JUST LA THAT

02:14:27.259 --> 02:14:29.127
BE ABOUT HALF OF THAT AMOUNT-

02:14:29.194 --> 02:14:31.363
AND SO. YOU KNOW RATHER THAN GO

02:14:31.430 --> 02:14:33.265
DOWN THAT ROAD AGAIN I WOULD

02:14:33.331 --> 02:14:36.835
HOPE THAT WE CAN FIND A WAY

02:14:36.902 --> 02:14:39.070
GOING FORWARD- TO HAVE US USE

02:14:39.137 --> 02:14:41.039
THE REVENUES THAT ARE AVAILABLE

02:14:41.106 --> 02:14:41.640
FOR US. TO BUILD THE SYSTEM

02:14:41.706 --> 02:14:43.742
THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO BUILD

02:14:43.809 --> 02:14:44.409

02:14:51.116 --> 02:14:53.318
CORRIDORS WE CAN. I WANT TO

02:14:53.385 --> 02:14:54.986
EMPHASIZE. THE WEIRD LÀ

TOGETHER IN THESE CORRIDORS FOR

02:14:57.022 --> 02:14:59.157
EXAMPLE I SAID EARLIER ALL OF

LÀ. DOWN THERE IS WORK THAT

02:15:11.336 --> 02:15:12.938
DOESN'T JUST BENEFIT HIGH SPEED

02:15:13.004 --> 02:15:14.940
RAIL. BENEFIT HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:15:15.006 --> 02:15:15.540
WILL BENEFIT METROLINK. IT'LL

02:15:15.607 --> 02:15:19.444
BENEFIT LOS UP. A AND THE SAME

02:15:19.511 --> 02:15:23.014
IS TRUE IN THE BAY AREA. THE

02:15:23.081 --> 02:15:23.515
STATE CAN ELECTRIFY THE

02:15:23.582 --> 02:15:24.115
CALTRAIN SYSTEM ALL THE WAY TO

02:15:24.182 --> 02:15:27.185

LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO RETAIN

02:36:31.482 --> 02:36:33.317

THIS ROOM AND I ALSO AGREE WITH

02:49:19.282 --> 02:49:21.484
THE FOLKS WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT

02:49:21.551 --> 02:49:23.119
FINDING LEAVING CENTRAL VALLEY

02:49:23.186 --> 02:49:25.188
AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY BEING

02:49:25.255 --> 02:49:29.292
ABANDONED CENTRAL VALLEY NOT

02:49:29.359 --> 02:49:29.893
GETTING THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS

02:49:29.959 --> 02:49:33.296
OF HAVING SUPPORTED. A

02:49:33.363 --> 02:49:33.863
CONTROVERSIAL PRODUCT AND A

02:49:33.930 --> 02:49:35.198
PROJECT THAT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN

02:49:35.265 --> 02:49:35.832
EASY. BECAUSE THIS ROB JEFF IN

02:49:35.899 --> 02:49:37.066
A LOT OF COMMUNITY IN FRESNO

02:49:37.133 --> 02:49:37.634
OTHER PLACES WITH BUSINESSES

02:49:37.700 --> 02:49:39.369
HAVING TO BE MOVED IN. PEOPLE

02:49:39.435 --> 02:49:41.104
GOING OUT IN A LINE AND SAYING

02:49:41.170 --> 02:49:41.771
I SUPPORT THIS AND THIS IS WHAT

02:49:41.838 --> 02:49:43.106
PUBLIC MONEY SHOULD BE USED

02:49:43.172 --> 02:49:43.606
FOR. AND NOW SEEING THE

02:49:43.673 --> 02:49:46.976
BENEFITS WITH JOBS IN. AND

02:49:47.043 --> 02:49:47.577
BUSINESS AND DEVELOPMENT BEING

02:49:47.644 --> 02:49:49.012
ATTRACTED INTO AN AREA THAT'S

02:49:49.078 --> 02:49:51.548
STRUGGLED FOR THOSE THINGS. SO

02:49:51.614 --> 02:49:53.216
I- ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT

02:49:53.283 --> 02:49:55.151
WHATEVER WE DO WE CAN'T ABANDON

02:49:55.218 --> 02:49:55.752
THAT PROMISE. AND WE HAVE TO

02:49:55.818 --> 02:49:57.253
MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A WIN

02:49:57.320 --> 02:49:59.122
FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN THIS

02:49:59.188 --> 02:50:01.190
PROJECT. SO I'M NOT ONE OF

02:50:01.257 --> 02:50:01.791
THOSE LET'S BUILDER YOU KNOW

02:50:01.858 --> 02:50:05.128
WHAT'S NOT BUILD IT. MY ISSUE

02:50:05.194 --> 02:50:07.163
IS HOW DO WE BUILD IT TO MAKE

02:50:07.230 --> 02:50:07.697
SURE WE HAVE A SUCCESSFUL

02:50:07.764 --> 02:50:09.432
PROJECT. AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR

02:50:09.499 --> 02:50:11.401
ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I THINK

02:50:11.467 --> 02:50:11.868
THERE'S A REALLY BIG

02:50:11.935 --> 02:50:13.136
DIFFERENCE. NOW IT IS SOME

02:50:13.202 --> 02:50:15.338
PEOPLE MAY THINK THAT BUILDING

02:50:15.405 --> 02:50:15.872
A TRAIN THAT GOES FROM

02:50:15.939 --> 02:50:19.208
BAKERSFIELD. TO MODESTO THAT

02:50:19.275 --> 02:50:20.877
EVEN IF THAT'S THE ONLY THING

02:50:20.944 --> 02:50:23.146
WE BUILD THAT SUCCESSFUL. THAT

02:50:23.212 --> 02:50:24.881
MAY BE TRUE I MEAN IT MAY VERY

02:50:24.948 --> 02:50:25.481
WELL BE THAT BAKERSFIELD IS

02:50:25.548 --> 02:50:27.250
GROWING AND FRESNO IS GROWING.

02:50:27.317 --> 02:50:29.052
AND MODESTO IS GROWING IN THAT

02:50:29.118 --> 02:50:31.220
MAYBE A VERY EXPENSIVE TWO

02:50:31.287 --> 02:50:33.189
HUNDRED MILE AN HOUR TRAIN THAT

02:50:33.256 --> 02:50:35.258
IS ONLY. BOOK BY THOSE CITY IS

02:50:35.325 --> 02:50:39.228
IT. IS IMPORTANT IS GOOD

02:50:39.295 --> 02:50:41.264
ENOUGH. AND THAT MAYBE I JUST

02:50:41.331 --> 02:50:41.831
DON'T KNOW BUT THAT'S NOT

02:50:41.898 --> 02:50:43.099
ALWAYS PROMISED TO CALIFORNIA

02:50:43.166 --> 02:50:45.034
BUT WE FROM. THEM IS LINKED.

02:50:45.101 --> 02:50:45.668
WITH THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUT ALL

02:50:45.735 --> 02:50:47.203
LOOKING THE CENTRAL VALLEY. TO

02:50:47.270 --> 02:50:49.072
THE BAY AREA AND- CENTRAL

02:50:49.138 --> 02:50:50.974
VALLEY TO LOS ANGELES AND MAYBE

02:50:51.040 --> 02:50:53.042
TO SAN DIEGO. TO ME THE

02:50:53.109 --> 02:50:55.244
SUCCESSFUL PROJECT WOULD BE ONE

02:50:55.311 --> 02:50:59.282

LIVE IN CENTRAL. A FACT TRAIN.

02:51:07.357 --> 02:51:07.890
THE BAY YEAH AND TO TRACTIVE

02:51:07.957 --> 02:51:09.192
THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DRIVE OR

02:51:09.258 --> 02:51:09.826
THAT YOU CAN TAKE A TRAIN. FROM

02:51:09.892 --> 02:51:11.160
RIGHT HERE IN FRESNO HOPEFULLY

02:51:11.227 --> 02:51:11.728
ONE DAY ALL THE WAY TO LOS

02:51:11.794 --> 02:51:13.096
ANGELES TO THE HAVING TO TAKE A

02:51:13.162 --> 02:51:13.730
BUS FROM BAKERS. DOWN BUT TO ME

02:51:13.796 --> 02:51:14.297
THAT'S WHAT SUCCESS REALLY

02:51:14.364 --> 02:51:15.331
LOOKS LIKE. SO I'M NOT SAYING

02:51:15.398 --> 02:51:15.898
LET'S PULL MONEY OUT OF THE

02:51:15.965 --> 02:51:17.333
CENTRAL VALLEY IN ABANDONED

02:51:17.400 --> 02:51:17.900
YOU. I SAY WHAT WE HAVE TO

02:51:17.967 --> 02:51:19.469
FIGURE OUT IS LEGISLATORS IT'S

02:51:19.535 --> 02:51:21.137
OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE

02:51:21.204 --> 02:51:23.239
THAT WHATEVER MONEY WE USE.

02:51:23.306 --> 02:51:25.475
GETS US TO THAT SCHOOL SYSTEM

02:51:25.541 --> 02:51:27.210
EVENTUALLY. AND AS FAST AS WE

02:51:27.276 --> 02:51:29.178
CAN IT WAS THE WORK. WERE

02:51:29.245 --> 02:51:31.314

HAVE THAT CONNECTIVE ITTY TO

02:51:33.349 --> 02:51:35.351
THE REST OF THE STATE. THAT'S

02:51:35.418 --> 02:51:36.986
WHAT I THINK SUCCESS LOOKS

02:51:37.053 --> 02:51:37.620
LIKE. SO THE QUESTION. IS HOW.

02:51:37.687 --> 02:51:39.622
TAKE THE MONEY THAT WE HAVE AND

02:51:39.689 --> 02:51:41.157
BRING THAT VISION TO FOR

02:51:41.224 --> 02:51:43.192
RUSSIAN AS- AS QUICKLY AS

02:51:43.259 --> 02:51:45.228

WE'RE DISCUSSING HERE IS NOT.

02:51:47.130 --> 02:51:49.599
IS NOT. LET'S NOT BUILD IT

02:51:49.666 --> 02:51:51.367
LET'S TO PULL MONEY OUT OF THE

02:51:51.434 --> 02:51:57.340
CENTRAL VALLEY. AND LEAVE THEM

02:51:57.407 --> 02:51:57.907
ALONE IT'S HOW DO WE GET TO

02:51:57.974 --> 02:52:01.044
WHERE THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

02:52:01.110 --> 02:52:01.678
CONNECT TO THAT EXTENT. ALL THE

02:52:01.744 --> 02:52:03.212
WAY TO THE BAY AREA AND ALL THE

02:52:03.279 --> 02:52:03.880
WAY TO LOS ANGELES. SO JUST TO

02:52:03.946 --> 02:52:05.281
BE CLEAR I THOUGHT I HEARD FROM

02:52:05.348 --> 02:52:05.882
PEOPLE THAT THEY WANT TO SEE

02:52:05.948 --> 02:52:07.617
AND I'M WITH YOU ON THAT AND

02:52:07.684 --> 02:52:08.184
IT'S KIND OF HOW DO WE MAKE

02:52:08.251 --> 02:52:09.152
SURE THAT THAT WHAT AN- EVER

02:52:09.218 --> 02:52:09.752

STICKING OUT THROUGH THE

02:52:15.391 --> 02:52:17.060
HEARING- I WOULD. PROBABLY

02:52:17.126 --> 02:52:19.529
COMMENT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE

02:52:19.595 --> 02:52:21.030
BETWEEN THE- MERCED BUT- IT

02:52:21.097 --> 02:52:21.631
COULD HAVE. BEEN A SLIP OF THE

02:52:21.698 --> 02:52:25.034
TONGUE IN THE LAST STATEMENT- I

02:52:25.101 --> 02:52:25.568

STATE IF I COULD. WHERE HE SAID

02:52:29.739 --> 02:52:31.274
THAT HIGH SPEED RAIL IS MORE

02:52:31.340 --> 02:52:33.009
THAN A TRAIN PROJECT. IT'S

02:52:33.076 --> 02:52:35.078
ABOUT ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION

02:52:35.144 --> 02:52:35.611
AND UNLOCKING THE ENORMOUS

02:52:35.678 --> 02:52:37.346

02:52:43.386 --> 02:52:45.388
THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR REPORT

02:52:45.455 --> 02:52:47.256
WHICH CONCLUDED THAT AN

02:52:47.323 --> 02:52:49.092
INVESTMENTS TO EXTEND THE

02:52:49.158 --> 02:52:49.759
CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENTS TUMORS

02:52:49.826 --> 02:52:51.794

WHILE INVESTMENTS IN EITHER THE

02:52:59.502 --> 02:53:01.037
BAY AREA OR SOMETHING

02:53:01.104 --> 02:53:03.206
CALIFORNIA. WOULD YOU BUILD

02:53:03.272 --> 02:53:05.007
LIMITED RIDERSHIP GROWTH AND

02:53:05.074 --> 02:53:07.210
MINIMAL IMPROVEMENT IN TRAVEL

02:53:07.276 --> 02:53:07.810
TIMES. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE

02:53:07.877 --> 02:53:09.679
QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS THAT WILL
