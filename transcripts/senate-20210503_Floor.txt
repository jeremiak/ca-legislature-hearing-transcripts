IT PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON HOW COUNTY'S LEGIT A CAPE HOUSE AND FACILITATE SERVICES FOR THESE YOUNG PEOPLE IT ALSO REQUIRES A REHABILITATION PLAN. TO HELP THEM ON THEIR PATH TO LEADING MEANINGFUL LIVES AS CHAIR OF SUB COMMITTEE FIVE I AM FOCUSED ON OUR VISION FOR A BETTER JUSTICE SYSTEM. I WILL WORK TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THE NEW OFFICE OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY IS ADEQUATELY STAFFED. IT SHOULD BE RESOURCE SO THAT TRUE ALIGNMENT FROM THE CORRECTIONS SYSTEM. TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES IS REALIZED. I CARE DEEPLY AS I'M SURE EVERYONE HERE ABOUT THE TRANSITION FROM A SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN SO DAMAGING TO OUR YOUTH AND COMMUNITIES TOWARDS A JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. THAT PROVIDES HEALING RESTORATION AND TRUE OPPORTUNITY FOR CHANGE. AND GROWTH THANK YOU. SENATOR NEAR. BUT A PRESENT RACISM OF THE SENATE I WOULD URGE YOU TO WAX CAUTIOUS ON THIS CONTINUED REFORMS. EVERY TIME THERE'S A MAJOR REFORM BILL AND THE NEXT YEAR WE HAVE TO DO A CLEAN UP. IT'S TESTIMONY THAT THE FIRST BILL WAS NOT VERY WELL THOUGHT OUT. THAT'S THE STANDARD PROCEDURE AROUND HERE. NOW THE REALIGNMENT OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM OR RATHER I WOULD SAY TURNING IT INSIDE OUT. IS NOT GONNA REALLY AND YOU'RE THE BENEFIT OF ANYBODY. IT'S GOING TO CREATE PROBLEMS IS WHAT I CALL THE PONTIUS PILOT THE STATE WASHES ITS HANDS OF THESE WARS THEY WERE CALLED WARD. AND A DOUBLE THE COUNTY'S. CARRIERS WILL NEVER SAY THEY'VE GOTTEN ENOUGH RESOURCES TO DEAL WITH THIS POPULATION. THEY'VE HAD TROUBLE WITH DEALING WITH WHAT THEY HAD FORMALLY HAD IN FACT SOME COUNTIES HAD THE CONSENT FORM CONSORTIUMS OF FACILITIES TO HOUSE THE PRE REFORM. JUVENILE OFFENDERS THAT WERE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND NOW MANY MORE ARE DESCENDING UPON. ALSO THE PRIMARY MISSION OF THE JUVENILE SYSTEM IS THE REHABILITATION OF THE LORD. I SUBMIT COUNTIES DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES. I SUBMIT THAT I'VE ALWAYS CALLED THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE RICHTER TREATMENTS INADEQUATE TO FOR THOSE JUVENILE LORCH BUT MOST ASSUREDLY I BELIEVE THAT IS GOING TO BE THE CASE WITHIN OUR COUNTIES. THERE WILL BE PROBLEMS BE ADVISED. AND DON'T BE SURPRISED IF THERE'S ANOTHER CLEAN UP BILL ON THE FLOOR HERE NEXT YEAR. I URGE AND NOBLE. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM.

ACTION ON DJJ REALIGNMENT OR FOR THOSE WHO MAY- WE DON'T ALWAYS REMEMBER ALL THE DETAILS- I JUST WANT TO BRING TO OUR ATTENTION THAT THE NUMBER OF JUVENILES HOUSED IN STATE RUN FACILITIES PEAK AT TEN THOUSAND IN THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES IT WAS IN THE- OF A- LITTLE UNDER THREE THOUSAND SAY TEN YEARS AGO TODAY IT IS ONLY SEVEN HUNDRED. AND THAT NUMBER IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT COUNTIES THE MAJORITY OF OUR COUNTIES HAVE SENT TO EITHER KNOWN OR VERY FEW USE TO DJJ FACILITIES OVER THE LAST FORTY FIVE YEARS IN FACT OF THE OVER THIRTY ONE THOUSAND JUVENILE COURT DISPOSITIONS IN TWENTY NINETEEN. ONLY THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE WORK COMMITTED TO DJJ AS COMPARED TO FIVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE THAT WERE COMMITTED TO A SECURED COUNTY FACILITY SO AS I MENTIONED THIS.

BECAUSE THE MEASURE IT'S A MOVEMENT DISORDER THAT IS CHARACTERIZED BY RANDOM INVOLUNTARY UNCONTROLLED MOVEMENTS OF DIFFERENT MUSCLES THROUGHOUT THE PERSON'S BODY.

THESE ARE FOLKS TRYING TO LIVE AND FUNCTION IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND UNFORTUNATELY THE LACK OF AWARENESS ABOUT THIS DISEASE CREATES A STIGMA. THE MORE WE CAN BRING AWARENESS TO THE STILLNESS OF ALL MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES TO THE FOREFRONT THE MORE WE CAN REMOVE THE TERRIBLE STIGMA AROUND. TARDAR DYSKINESIA IS OFTEN UNRECOGNIZED IN PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM THE ILLNESS ARE COMMONLY MISDIAGNOSED BUT THERE IS SOME HOPE. SEVERAL YEARS AGO.

GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS I'M EXCITED TO PRESENT SB SEVEN SEVEN NINE. BEFORE THE PANDEMIC CALIFORNIANS WITH BUILDERS TO IMPLANT. CLICK ON HOMELESS POPULATION ARE VETERANS BERMAN INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS STRUGGLE TO EARN A LIVING. WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO BOUNCE BACK IS TO SUPPORT PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE SKILLS BASED TRAINING. AND EMPLOYMENT AT THE SAME TIME. EMPLOYMENT SOCIAL ENTERPRISES- ESCS. AND WORKER CO OPS. RIGHT INNOVATIVE EVIDENCE BASED APPROACHES TO DO THIS. I HAVE SHOWN THEY CAN JUST DECREASE RECIDIVISM. AND ALSO BREAK CYCLES OF HOMELESSNESS. SB SEVEN SEVEN NINE IS NOT A MANDATE IS A RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE MODELS. BUT THE MODEL LIKE THIS BY ROBERTS ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT FOUNDATION. THEY OPEN MY EYES TO SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP. TWENTY FOUR YEARS AGO. MODELS LIKE HOMEBOY INDUSTRIES THAT EMPLOY SIX HUNDRED RECENT INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS- FOR FORMER GANG MEMBERS WELL PUTTING THEM THROUGH AN EIGHTEEN MONTH TRAINING PROGRAM. FOR GOOD WILL ENTERPRISES EMPLOYS NINETEEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS 85% IN THIS CATEGORY. FRANKLY SEEN OUR COMMITMENT TO EARN AND LEARN PROGRAMMES WILL BE GIVING THESE CALIFORNIANS WITH AREAS TO IMPLEMENT. AN OPPORTUNITY. TO OVERTIME SUSTAIN THEMSELVES REDUCE OUR DEPENDENCE ON GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. AND SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES.

BOB OF BURGER BUT SENATOR I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING YOUR FIRST BILL TO THE FLOOR TODAY. HI I JUST MY UNDERSTANDING YOU'RE CHANGING VARIOUS DEFINITIONS ONE OF THE FACT IT MEANS A LOT TO ME. AND SO I THINK THAT THIS BILL DEMANDS A LITTLE MORE SCRUTINY THAN THAT AND THEN THE- NOT AS SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE SO. I YOU KNOW I I'D LIKE YOU TO TALK A BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE DEFINITE SO WHICH OF THE DEFINITIONS THAT YOU'RE CHANGING OR ADDING TO. THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE INNOVATION OPPORTUNITY ACT. WHICH OF THOSE DEFINITIONS OF THEIR FAVORITE CHANGE AND WHY. PLEASE TELL. THAT CHANGES WELL. WELL THANK SENATOR WE'RE ADDING MODELS LAKE THESE IN SO AND- YOUR. EIGHT AND- COOPER. TO THE DEFINITION OF A CAN BE- AND LEARN PROGRAM. BUT BUT WHY WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT TO YOU AND WHY WHY IS IT YOUR FAVORITE. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT REALLY ENABLES THAT THE HEART OF THIS BILL THANK YOU SENATOR. Q. PROVIDE. MORE FUNDING FOR THESE OR TO LEARN PROGRAMS THAT THE FUTURE OF WORK COMMISSION GETS ISSUED ITS FINAL REPORT. AND RECOMMENDED THAT WE DO THIS THAT THE STATE MOVED MORE SUPPORT TO THESE OR LEARN PROGRAMS LIKE IMPLEMENT SOCIAL ENTERPRISES AND IS THAT LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS US TO DO THAT. MEMBERS OF MY I APPRECIATE YOUR DILIGENCE BUT YOU KNOW THAT EVEN SIMPLER SOCIAL ENTERPRISE EXTRAORDINARILY- BUREAUCRATIC. TO ME AND I WOULD LIKE A KIND OF A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHO CAME UP WITH THIS TITLE AND- AND HOW IT CAN POSSIBLY BE JUSTIFIED WITHOUT ALL RESERVE THE REST MY QUESTIONS. WELL IT'S NOT ME WHO CAME UP WITH IT. AND IT IS WE DO A LOT OF GUYS ACRONYMS IN GOVERNMENT BUT IT IS A PARTICULARLY AFTER ONE THAT THESE ARE BUSINESSES. THAT EMPLOY PEOPLE PROBABLY TRAIN THEM. K. SENATOR HERTZBERG. YEAH QUESTION- TWO QUESTIONS ACTUALLY FOR THE AUTHOR IF I CAN MANAGE HERE- YES M. F. D. WITH RESPECT TO THIS DEATH THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE TAKE QUESTIONS BUT YES A YEAR WITH RESPECT TO THE DEFINITION OF AN- THESE EMPLOYMENT- BUT YOU FIND IT SOCIAL ENTERPRISES IT INDICATES TWO THINGS THAT I THINK ARE QUITE CRITICAL HERE ONE THAT AS THE REQUIREMENTS SAY THAT IT'S EVIDENCE BASED AND UTILIZES DATA DRIVEN POLICIES TO MAKE SUCH DETERMINATIONS IS THE CASE AND SECONDLY IT BROADLY DEFINES PRODUCES GOODS TO PROVIDE SERVICES IS THERE ANY LIMITATIONS ON WHAT KIND OF GOODS COULD FOR EXAMPLE IN THIS PROGRAM INCLUDE THE PRODUCTION OF GUNS. OR BAZOOKAS OR WHATEVER WHO IS ARE SOME LIMITATION IN TERMS YOUR DEFINITIONS QUESTIONS THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU CENTER HERTZBERG YOUR MICHAEL FOR YOUR QUESTIONS. THE ENTERPRISES ARE NOT BROADLY DEFINED IN THIS PROVISION. BUT OVER TIME WE WANT TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAMS LIKE I MENTIONED HOMEBOY INDUSTRIES A GOODWILL INDUSTRIES AT THE COMMUNITY HOUSING PARTNERSHIPS IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT IS SOLUTIONS ASSET. THAT EMPLOYEES ARE FORMERLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND TRAIN THEM TO BE FRONTLINE DIFFERENT DESK WORKERS THESE ARE THE KIND OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE VISION BY THIS LEGISLATION. CONFEDERAL QUICK IS A LITTLE YOU JUST SIMPLY SAY SERVICES OR OR OR OR GOODS YOU INDICATE THAT WHAT YOUR INTENTION IS BUT THE LANGUAGE OF THE MEASURE DOESN'T SAY THAT. WELL SINCE THIS IS A- NOT A MANDATE IT IS ULTIMATELY UP TO THE LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARDS TO DO ISSUE THAT FUNDING SO I WILL LEAVE IT TO THEIR DISCRETION TO LEAVE OUT THE KINDS OF BUSINESSES. THAT YOU MENTIONED. PERFECT SENATOR WIENER AND SENATOR BAKER IF THERE ARE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS IF YOU'D LIKE TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS IN YOUR CLOSING THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE AS WELL SENATOR WIENER. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I REQUEST OF THE AUTHOR. A. B. WELL- SO YES SIR YES OKAY- SO YOU INTERESTED IN THIS IT HAS A DEFINITION OF- QUOTE WORKER COOPERATIVES. AND THAT DEFINITION IS IN THE CORPORATION'S CODE AFTER I FIND OUT A LITTLE BIT OFFENSIVE BECAUSE WORKERS COOPERATIVES ABOUT. YOU KNOW POWER TO THE PEOPLE AND THE CORPORATIONS CODE IS SORT OF CORPORATE AND SO I'M JUST WONDERING HOW YOU JUSTIFY DEFINING SOMETHING SO IMPORTANT ABOUT A WORKERS COOPERATIVE. IN THE CORPORATION'S CODE CAN USE US JUSTIFY THAT. BUT IN THE OF TIME ARE THERE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SINCE I NEED TO CHAIR THIS. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SEEING NINETY SENATOR BAKER OU ME WRAP THIS ALL UP BY ANSWERING ALL THOSE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU THANKS TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR THE GENTLE ADDRESSING HERE TODAY- ON AN IMPORTANT TOPIC. OF THESE EMPLOYMENT SOCIAL ENTERPRISES THAT ROOF IN RESPONSE TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO'S QUESTIONS- I BELIEVE IT'S OKAY THAT THE DEFINITIONS IN THE CORPORATION'S QUOTE THE POINT IS THESE WORKER COOPS. I NEED TO BE SUPPORTED AND THEY NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING RIGHT NOW ABOUT 1% OF OUR WORKFORCE DOLLARS GO TO THESE MODELS. THAT WILL BE A FUTURE WORK COMMISSION SAID THAT WE SHOULD GO UP TO A 30% FOR THESE MODELS. SO IN THAT CONTEXT WITH THESE COMMENTS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. BUT SENATOR BAKER THIS WAS- ARE ELIGIBLE FOR UNANIMOUS ROLL CALL. OF LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY OBJECTION TO S. PROCEEDING WITH IT.

FINANCIAL EDUCATION HAS THE POTENTIAL TO GENERATE LONG TERM BENEFITS AND A STRONG UNDERSTANDING OF THE BASICS IS VITAL FOR EVERYONE TRYING TO NAVIGATE TODAY'S COMPLEX FINANCIAL LANDSCAPE. A LACK OF FINANCIAL CAPABILITY IS A REAL CONSEQUENCE FOR INDIVIDUALS INCLUDING LOWER SAVINGS RATE LOWER CREDIT SCORES AND LESS WEALTH OVERALL. FOR STUDENTS FINANCIAL EDUCATION CAN LEAD TO RESPONSIBLE COLLEGE FINANCING DECISIONS INCREASE SAVINGS AND A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF CREDIT ADDITIONALLY ARE USE ARE SHOWING MORE AND MORE INTEREST IN LEARNING ABOUT FINANCIAL TOPICS. I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO RECOGNIZE SOME OF THE GREAT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND COMMUNITY LENDERS WITH TRUSTED FINANCIAL ADVISORS THAT PROVIDE FINANCIAL EDUCATION TO OUR COMMUNITY. FOR INSTANCE IN TWENTY TWENTY THEIR INSTITUTIONS THAT PROVIDED ALMOST NINE THOUSAND STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA WITH FINANCIAL LITERACY PROGRAM CALLED BITE OF REALITY THAT TEACHES STUDENTS HOW TO PROPERLY BUDGET ASSIGNING THEM AN IDENTITY AND SHOWING THEM HOW TO NAVIGATE ADULTHOOD. AND PROPERLY MANAGE THEIR EXPENSES. WHAT THE PROGRAM IS TO HELD IN PERSON. DOZENS OF CREDIT UNIONS ADJUSTED TO OFFER THE PROGRAM ORIGINALLY DUE TO SAFETY CONCERNS AND GUIDELINES FROM CLUB IN NINETEEN. AFTER COMPLETING THE PROGRAM STUDENTS EXPRESSED AN OVERWHELMING INTENDS TO CREATE AND FOLLOW BUDGET SET SAVINGS GOALS AND TRACK THEIR SPENDING. FINANCIAL LITERACY RATES DIRECTLY IMPACT THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES AND OUR COMMUNITIES GIVING US ALL A REASON TO SUPPORT THE EFFORTS TO INCREASE FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AMONGST CALIFORNIANS.
