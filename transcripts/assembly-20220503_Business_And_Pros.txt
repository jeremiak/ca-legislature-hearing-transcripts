NICOLE GOOD TO SEE YOU ON THE SCREEN THANKS SO MUCH FOR PARTICIPATING THIS MORNING. YEAH GOOD MORNING YEAH. COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I LET ME BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE TO YOU ALL ON THE DEPARTMENTS MY NAME IS NICOLE ELLIOTT. I HAD THE HONOR OF SERVING AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROL. JOINING ME TODAY ARE MY CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR RUSSIA SELAMA AND OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CHEMICALS AND- IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY TO UPDATE YOU ON THAT INCREDIBLE PROGRESS THE DEPARTMENT HAS MADE IN THE TEN MONTHS SINCE OUR DEPARTMENT WAS OFFICIALLY ESTABLISHED. AS AN ORGANIZATION OUR VISION IS TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A SAFE SUSTAINABLE AND EQUITABLE CANNABIS MARKET THAT SERVES AS AN EXAMPLE FOR THE WORLD. WE ARE CLEAR EYED THAT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT WORK WE MUST DO AS WE WORK TOWARDS THIS VISION. SINCE DAY ONE IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLE TO SEE THE SIGNIFICANT STRIDES A CONSOLIDATED DEPARTMENT CAN MAKE IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. A FEW EXAMPLES OF THE STRIDES INCLUDE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT'S OUTSTANDING LEADERSHIP TEAM. THOSE WHO ARE WORKING ALONGSIDE ME TO EFFECTUATE THE DEPARTMENT'S CONSOLIDATION THROUGH IMPLEMENTING PROGRAM EFFICIENCIES PROCESS CHANGES AND XCELERATED RECRUITMENT EFFORTS TO FILL VACANCIES. WITHIN TEN WEEKS WE CONSOLIDATED THREE SETS OF REGULATIONS INTO ONE PROVIDING MORE CLARITY AND CONSISTENCY TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS. THE DEPARTMENT HAS ALSO DISTRIBUTED A ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR GRANT PROGRAM TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO SUPPORT THEM. AND THEY'RE LARGELY LEGACY EQUITY AND SMALL. Z. IS TRANSITION TO ANNUAL LICENSES THESE GRANTS FIND A NUMBER OF EFFORTS INCLUDING LOCAL ADMINISTRATION AND A COMPLETE MESS THE COMPLETION OF ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS. CREATED IN EQUITY WAIVER. AND WE WANT CANNOT CONNECT A RESOURCE HUB WITH TOOLS TO SUPPORT LICENSEE COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. I'M SO PROUD OF MY TEAMS MANY ACCOMPLISHMENTS WE'VE BEEN ABLE AND THOUGHTFUL AND WE ARE ENERGIZED FOR THE ENORMITY OF OUR WORK AHEAD WE'RE NECESSARY TO MEET OUR MISSION TO ADVANCE TO FACILITATE A WELL REGULATED LEGAL MARKET THAT BENEFITS ALL CALIFORNIANS. WE ALSO REMAIN FOCUSED ON ENHANCING OUR WORK RELATED TO LICENSING ENFORCEMENT COMPLIANCE AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS SO I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU A BIT MORE ABOUT THESE EFFORTS AS WELL DEPARTMENT WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASE IN APPLICATIONS LICENSE RENEWALS AND PROVISIONAL ST TRANSITIONING TO ANIMALS. LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE PUT IN PLACE A RIGOROUS FRAMEWORK FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO BEGIN PHASING OUT PROVISIONAL LICENSES BY JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY SIX. AND BETWEEN NOW AND THEN SHIFT PROVISIONAL ON PROVISIONAL LICENCES TO ANIMALS. AS PART OF THIS PHASE OUT THERE ARE SEVERAL STATUTORY DEADLINES THAT ARE DICTATING OUR OPERATIONAL PRIORITIES. THESE INCLUDE ON JUNE THIRTIETH OFTHIS YEAR THAT WOULD BE THE LAST DATA DEPARTMENT MAY ISSUE PROVISIONAL LICENSES EXCLUDING. A PROVISIONAL LICENSES FOR EQUITY APPLICANTS AND CERTAIN SMALL CULTIVATORS. SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH OF THIS YEAR WILL BE THE LAST DAY TO ISSUE PROVISIONAL LICENSES FOR THESE SAME SMALL CULTIVATORS. JANUARY FIRST OF NEXT YEAR WILL BE THE SUNSETTING OF PROVISIONAL CULTIVATION LICENSES FOR LARGER CULTIVATION. ARE LARGER CULTIVATORS I SHOULD SAY THAT RESULT IN A TYPE FIVE FIVE EIGHT OR FIVE BE LICENSE. ON MARCH THIRTY FIRST- OF NEXT YEAR WILL BE THE LAST DAY FOR EQUITY OPERATORS TO APPLY FOR A PROVISIONAL LICENSE FOR MOST LICENSE TYPES. AND ON JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WILL BE THE LAST DAY FOR OUR ENTIRE PROVISIONAL POPULATION TO RECEIVE RENEWALS OF ANY PROVISIONAL LICENSE. AS THE UPCOMING JUNE THIRTIETH STATUTORY DEADLINE TO ISSUE PROVISIONAL LICENSES INCHES CLOSER AND WITH THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN LICENSE APPLICATIONS TO REVIEW. DEPARTMENT IS ENHANCING ITS FOCUS ON PROCESSING THOUSANDS OF APPLICATIONS SEEKING PROVISIONAL LICENSURE. TO ACCOMMODATE FOR THIS INCREASED VOLUME OF APPLICATIONS ARE LICENSING DIVISION HAS BEEN FOCUSING ON HIRING ADDITIONAL STAFF AND PRIORITIZING THE PROCESS PROCESSING OF THESE APPLICATIONS IN THE SHORT TERM. I LOOK FORWARD TO PROVIDING THE LEGISLATURE WITH A COMPREHENSIVE REPORT ON THE STATUS OF PROVISIONAL ANNUAL AN APPLICATION LICENSING IN OCTOBER OF THIS YEAR AND FURTHER MORE I ALSO INTEND TO NOTIFY THE LEGISLATURE. OUTSIDE OF OUR REPORTING DEADLINES INVITATIONAL SUPPORT IS NEEDED TO AID WITH THE TRANSITION OF PROVISIONAL LICENCES TO ANIMALS. ON THE ISSUE OF ENFORCEMENT OUR DIVISION OUR ENFORCEMENT DIVISION I IS RESPONSIBLE FOR TARGETING ILLEGAL CANNABIS CULTIVATORS DISTRIBUTORS MANUFACTURERS AND RETAILERS OPERATING THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. OUR OFFICERS CONDUCT CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS OF ILLEGAL OPERATORS TO FULFILL THEIR MERGING THEIR MISSION THEY WORK CLOSELY WITH THEIR COUNTERPARTS AT EVERY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT EXTENDING TO CITY COUNTY STATE AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. FOR EXAMPLE OUR ENFORCEMENT TEAM PARTICIPATE PARTICIPATE IN A VARIETY OF TASK FORCES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA TO STRATEGICALLY TARGET ILLICIT OPERATIONS THAT POSE SERIOUS AN IMMENSE IMMINENT THREATS TO THE PUBLIC THE ENVIRONMENT. AND UNFAIR COMPETITION TO ARE LEGITIMATE AND LICENSED OPERATORS. OVER THE LAST TEN MONTHS WE'VE FOCUSED ON INCREASING HIRING IN THIS DIVISION AND THROUGH THIS FOCUSED EFFORT WE HAVE CUT OUR ENFORCEMENT DIVISION VACANCY RATE BY OVER HALF. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A NEW TEAM IN FRESNO AND WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING TWO NEW TEAMS IN LOS ANGELES. DUE TO THIS INCREASE ENFORCEMENT CAPACITY WE HAVE INCREASED OUR REACH ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN MORE OPERATIONS COMBATING THE ILLICIT MARKET. FOR EXAMPLE. FROM JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO APRIL OF THIS YEAR OUR ENFORCEMENT DIVISION INCREASED THE NUMBER OF WARRANTS THEY ISSUED BY ALMOST TWO HUNDRED PERCENT. RESULTING IN AN OVERT IN A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN PLANTS AROUND TO CREATE A RADIC HATED AMONG MANY OTHER THINGS. ALSO WHERE APPROPRIATE THE ENFORCEMENT DIVISION ALSO WORKS WITH OUR COMPLIANCE DIVISION TO INVESTIGATE LICENSED OPERATORS WHO ARE WORKING IN THE LEGAL AND ILLEGAL MARKET. OUR COMPLIANCE DIVISION IS COMPRISED OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE NON SWORN STAFF AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE OF LICENSED OPERATORS. AND UP HOLDING THE INTEGRITY OF THE LEGAL MARKET COMPLIANCE STAFF CONDUCT DESK AUDITS ROUTINE INSPECTIONS AND WHERE NECESSARY THE ISSUANCE OF CITATIONS AND A MINISTRY OF ACTIONS TO LICENSED AND UNLICENSED OPERATORS. TRACKING TRACE IS ALSO IN THE COME COMPLIANCE DIVISION- AND THE TEAM USES IT AS A PRIMARY TOOL FOR TREATING CANNABIS AND GOODS FROM SEED TO SALE. OUR LICENSEES USE THE SYSTEM TO PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT WITH DATA THAT WE UTILIZE TO BETTER ENSURE LICENSEE ACTIVITY COMPLIES. WITH LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS AND ALSO TO SWIFTLY PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH SHOULD WE EVER NEED TO RECALL PRODUCTS. THE FUNCTIONALITY OF TRACK AND TRACE IT IS IMPORTANT TO US AND IS WHY WE RECENTLY HELD FIELD INSPECTIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WITH OUR TRACK AND TRACE OPERATOR METRIC. WE WANTED TO BE SURE WE AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THEY COULD HEAR DIRECTLY FROM LICENSEES ABOUT HOW THE SYSTEM FUNCTIONS. HOW THE FUNCTIONALITY CAN BE IMPROVED WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE DATA AT IN INFORMATION THAT THE STATE IS USING TO SUPPORT OUR COMPLIANCE EFFORTS. IN THE LAST TEN MONTHS THE COMPLAINT OF IT THE COMPLIANCE DIVISION PERFORMED APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED INSPECTIONS. AND ISSUED THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY SEVEN NOTICES TO COMPLY TO LICENSEES FOR VIOLATIONS UNCOVERED DURING INSPECTIONS AS WELL AS NINETEEN LICENSE ACTIONS RELOCATIONS SUSPENSIONS FOR MORE SERIOUS CASES. OUR COMPLAINTS DIVISION WORKS COLLABORATIVELY WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES. AND PARTICIPATES ON MULTI AGENCY TASK FORCES INCLUDING THE CANNABIS ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM WHICH IS LED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE TO ADDRESS THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE LEGAL CULTIVATION. WE HAVE DEDICATED SPECIAL INVESTIGATORS TO SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM AND ITS OPERATIONS AFTER THE TASK FORCE IDENTIFIES AN UNLISTED CULTIVATION SITE AND OBTAIN SEARCH WARRANTS ARE INVESTIGATORS JOIN EACH OPERATION TO INSPECT THE SITE. AND GATHER EVIDENCE TO PURSUE ADMINISTRATIVE OR CIVIL CASES RELATED TO LICENSING VIOLATIONS. AS A DEPARTMENT WE CONTINUE TO TACKLE OUR DAY TO DAY RESPONSIBILITIES AS WELL AS UNIFIED REALIGN OUR BUSINESS PROCESS USED TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE WORK AHEAD OF US. WE REMAIN VERY FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING THE DEPARTMENTS VACANCY RATE TO BUILD A HEALTHY ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE WITH A STRONG TEAM AND WE DO THIS BY AGGRESSIVELY RECRUITING I TO AND ENHANCE OUR CAPACITY AND KNOWING THAT THIS IS THE SINGLE GREATEST THING WE CAN DO. TO MORE EFFECTIVELY MEET OUR MANDATES AND AVOID BARRIERS WE MAY FACE FROM LONG TERM STAFFING SHORTAGES. AS WE CONTINUE ALL OF THIS WORK WE MAINTAIN A STEADY I ON OUR FUNDAMENTAL MISSION. TO FACILITATE AND DEVELOP A SAFE SUSTAINABLE AND EQUITABLE MARKET THAT IS SUPPORTED BY A SMART REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. IT PRESERVES THE ENVIRONMENT SUPPORTS CONSUMER SAFETY AND SUSTAINS BUSINESSES THAT WANT TO DO THE SAME. RECENTLY THE DEPARTMENT'S FORTY FIVE DAY PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD ENDED A FOR THE CERTIFICATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED EMERGENCY REGULATIONS. THIS IS A FORMAL RULE MAKING PROCESS IS ROBUST AND CAN SPEND EIGHT TO TWELVE MONTHS FROM START TO FINISH. WE ANTICIPATE THIS RULEMAKING PACKAGE TO BE FINALIZED BEFORE THE FALL OF THIS YEAR. THROUGHOUT THE RULE MAKING PROCESS STAKEHOLDERS HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THEIR THOUGHTS FEEDBACK AND ANY CONCERNS ARE PROPOSED REGULATORY CHANGES TO PUBLIC COMMENT. WHICH CAN BE PROVIDED IN WRITING OR VERBALLY AT OUR PUBLIC COMMENT HEARINGS. MY STAFF HAS PROVIDED TO THIS COMMITTEE A SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSED REGULATORY CHANGES THAT COMPARES HOW ARE PROPOSED CONSOLIDATED REGULATIONS MODIFY EXISTING REGULATIONS FOR YOUR REVIEW ANY INFORMATION ON THE SPECIFIC CHANGES INCLUDED IN THIS PACKAGE. WHICH CHANGES AIM TO STREAMLINE AND SIMPLIFY EXISTING CANNABIS REGULATION ENHANCE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND MAKE PERMANENT CHANGES THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN EFFECT AS EMERGENCY REGULATIONS. WE RECEIVED NEARLY ONE THOUSAND PUBLIC COMMENTS FOR OUR CONSOLIDATED REGULATIONS AND HAVE AND WILL CONTINUE TO SPEND SIGNIFICANT TIME REVIEWING RESPONDING AND ASSESSING THESE COMMENTS AS WE CONSIDER WHAT CHANGES TO SUBMIT FOR OUR PROPOSED CONSOLIDATED REGULATIONS. THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF SUPPORT FOR MANY OF THESE PROPOSED CHANGES AND INITIAL COMMENTS WE WERE WE- THAT WE ARE REVIEWING CONFIRM THAT THIS SUPPORT IS BROAD. WE ALSO RECEIVED CLARIFYING SUGGESTIONS THAT WERE EVALUATED TO DETERMINE IF CHANGES IN THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS ARE APPROPRIATE. HE'S PROPOSED CONSOLIDATED REGULATIONS ARE AN IMPORTANT REFLECTION OF THE DEPARTMENTS COULD COMMITMENT TO LISTEN SINCERELY CONSIDER AND WHERE APPROPRIATE BE RESPONSIVE TO THE INPUT BY A VARIETY OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS. BEFORE CLOSING I'D-LIKE TO PROVIDE A BRIEF UPDATE ON CANNABIS TAX REFORM. THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS ON CANNABIS TAX REFORM. WE ANTICIPATE A PROPOSAL BEING PUT FORWARD THAT AIMS TO GREATLY SIMPLIFY TAX COLLECTION REDUCING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF BURDENS CURRENTLY PLACED ON LICENSEES BY THE STATE'S EXISTING TAX FRAMEWORK. REDUCE THE TAX BURDEN ON LICENSEES AND CONSUMERS AND DO ALL OF THIS WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING OUR LONG TERM FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS TO YOUTH PROGRAMS PUBLIC SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION. DCC IS COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING DISCUSSIONS THAT WILL RESULT IN CANNABIS TAX POLICIES THAT PROMOTE EQUITY AND TRANSPARENCY AND THAT AIM TO STABILIZE THE MARKET IN WHICH OUR LICENSEES OPERATE. TO CONCLUDE I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR TIME AND FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP AN INTEREST IN THE WORK OF THE DEPARTMENT. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MS ELLIOTT APPRECIATE THE VERY THOROUGH- UPDATE ON EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING- AND TOUCHING UPON A LOT OF THE ISSUES- THAT THAT. MIGHT HAVE FOLLOW QUESTIONS ON- BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS WE'VE BEEN JOINED BY COLLEAGUES- SO I WANT TO TURN IT OVER WAS LONELY. FOR A MINUTE THERE I WANT TO TURN IT OVER TO- TO COLLEAGUES- FIRST TO SEE IF ANYBODY HAS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THAT THEY LIKE TO ASK- THAT APARTMENT- HOUSE. FROM ELEVEN- IS DOLLY SOMBER DOLLAR. THANK YOU SO MUCH I JUST WOULD LIKE COULD YOU PLEASE CLARIFY THE TASK FORCE THAT YOU MENTIONED- I HAVE A- IN MY DISTRICT WE HAVE A LOT TO BE A LITTLE. ILLEGAL GROWING- DESTROYING THE ENVIRONMENT. AND I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT SO I'M JUST I AM INTERESTED TO KNOW WHAT THE TASK FORCE YOU MENTIONED AND HOW YOU'RE COLLABORATING. WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE FORCE AYE IT REFERRED TO IS THE CAMPUS ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM- AND IT IS A TASK FORCE COMPRISED COMPRISED OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM OUR DEPARTMENT. DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE IN THE STATE WATER BOARD- AND OUR DEPARTMENT CURRENTLY HAS SEVEN POSITIONS THAT WE USE. IN OUR COMPLIANCE DIVISION TO SUPPORT THE OPERATIONS- OF THAT TASK FORCE PREDOMINANTLY TO PURSUE SIT CIVIL AND ADMINISTRATIVE CITATIONS FOR ILLICIT ACTIVITY. AND JUST TO BE CLEAR SORRY TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT THE ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM CAMPUS ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM FOCUSES SIGNIFICANTLY ON A LEGAL PRODUCTION. AYE IMPACTING- WATER WAYS AND OUR NATURAL RESOURCES. SO PERHAPS TO YOUR CONCERN ASSEMBLY WOMAN. YES SO SEVEN SEVEN STAFF DOES NOT SEEM LIKE. A ROBUST. I'M SURE YOU'RE DOING ABOUT THAT WOULD THAT BE SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD THINK TO EXPAND THAT- PORTION OF YOUR DEPARTMENT TO ADD MORE STAFF TO BE ABLE TO WHAT I'M HEARING IN pDIFFICULT TO COORDINATE WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT THE WATER BOARD YOU KNOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AND I KNOW YOU WENT INTO DEPTH ON LOCAL ORDINANCES VERSUS THE STATE AND FEDERAL I KNOW THIS IS VERY COMPLICATED. BUT I'M WHAT DO YOU SEE MOVING FORWARD THE FOR YOUR DEPARTMENT SPECIFICALLY THAT YOU. COULD HAVE JUST SUB BUILD UP SOME MORE I MEAN WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT YEAH I KNOW YOU'RE TALKING TO THE GOVERNOR ABOUT BUDGET ISSUES. SO WHEN IT COMES TO ARE THE WORK OF THE CANNABIS ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM I SHOULD SAY THAT'S NOT ALL INCLUSIVE OF OUR ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS AS A STATE. I'M AS WELL AS SPECIFICALLY FOR THE DEPARTMENT THE STAFF THAT ARE SUPPORTING THE CANNABIS INFO ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM. US TO THAT TASK FORCE OUR COMPLIANCE STAFF SO THEY ARE NON SWORN. HOWEVER WE DO HAVE A SWORN DIVISION AND AS I REFERRED IT TO IN MY TALKING POINTS AND THOSE ARE IN MY OPENING STATEMENTS. I WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE CAPACITY OF THAT DIVISION AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. DO SO THROUGH AGGRESSIVE HIRING EFFORTS. THAT DIVISION WORKS VERY CLOSELY OUR IN PARTICULAR WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO SUPPORT OPERATIONS I'M ACROSS THE STATE. I'M AN EIGHT WILL I DON'T WANNA SPEAK FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE BUT I KNOW THROUGH EXPERIENCE THEY DO AS WELL. I'M IN PARTICULAR IN THE AREAS OF ILLEGAL CULTIVATION SO IF THERE IS A NEED FOR MORE POSITIONS TO SUPPORT THAT WE WILL ABSOLUTELY COME BACK AND LET THE LEGISLATURE NOW BUT WE ARE CURRENTLY FOCUSING ON HIRING INTO THE EXISTING APPROVED POSITIONS THAT WE HAVE. THANK YOU. FAVOR MUCH I'M GOING TO TURN OUT OF THE CONNECT THE OVERSIGHT HEARING OVER THIS ON A NUMBER IRWIN I'M GONNA RACE OVER THE CAPITAL I'LL BE BACK- IF QUESTIONS- WRAP UP IN THE MEANTIME WE'LL GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT AND AS ALWAYS IF YOU CAN HANG OUT- I MIGHT HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR YOU ONCE I GET BACK- DEPENDING WHERE WE'RE AT. THANKS SO MUCH. RIGHT MISTER GRAYSON DID YOU HAVE SOME QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR SUBSTITUTE. THANK YOU FOR THAT- AND BACK TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY PART OF IT. HAS HAS THERE BEEN AN EFFORT OR HAS THERE BEEN OF ANY TYPE OF A SYSTEM WHERE WE CAN COLLECT DATA ON ON PUBLIC SAFETY ESPECIALLY ON DELIVERY- WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THERE IS A PROPOSAL IN THE REGULATIONS. TO INCREASE FROM 500-021-0000 AND HAVE WE COLLECTED DATA ON THE ON- THE SAFETY OF THE DELIVERY DRIVERS. YOU HEAR A MULTIPLE CASES ANECDOTAL CASES WHERE- SAFETY HAS BEEN COMPROMISED A ROBBERY OR OR DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT IN THE MIDST OF THE DELIVERY- ARE WE PUTTING THE DRIVERS OF DELIVERS MORE APPAREL OR IS THAT NOT AN ISSUE- AND- DRIVERS HAVE BEEN AND ARE CONSIDERED SAFE AND- AND WILL BE IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- YOU KNOW DELIVERY SERVICES I AND THEIR DRIVERS ARE ARE CRUCIAL TO PROVIDING CONSUMERS SAFE TESTED AT LEGAL PROCESS- AS LEGAL ACCESS I SHOULD SAY TO PRODUCT- WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE AND I WILL OPEN IT UP TO MY COLLEAGUES TO WEIGH IN AS WELL. I'M A TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE- WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED ANY INCREASE- IN PUBLIC SAFETY INCIDENTS RELATED TO DELIVERY DRIVERS I'M SO WE DO NOT HAVE CONCERNED THAT THAT PROPOSED INCREASE- WILL WILL COST PUBLIC SAFETY INCIDENTS. I'M THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THEY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO NOTIFY THE DEPARTMENT OF I'M AND I DO NOT BELIEVE WE HAVE RECEIVED ANY NOTIFICATIONS I IN THE TIME SINCE THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN CREATED. THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. YES THAT WAS THAT WAS GOOD- WELL. IS THERE AN EFFORT TO COLLECT THAT DATA OR IS IT PRETTY MUCH ON A LOCAL LEVEL. SO IF IT IF A DELIVERY DRIVER- EXPERIENCED AN INCIDENT- OF THEFT- OR ANY SORT OF PUBLIC SAFETY INCIDENT WE WOULD ASK THROUGH REGULATION I BELIEVE WE REQUIRED THAT THEY NOTIFY THE DEPARTMENT OF THAT INCIDENT. ALSO THERE IS AN EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE TO SUPPORT THE COLLECTION OF THAT DATA THAT ANSWERS MY QUESTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WILK THANK YOU AND YOU CAN SEE ENFORCEMENT IS A BIG QUESTION FOR ALL OF US AND WE'RE NOT SURE IF YOU HAVE THE- THE APPROPRIATE RESOURCES- IN THAT DEPARTMENT BUT I'VE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. DIVING A LITTLE BIT DEEPER SO- THAT REGULATIONS. APPEAR TO HAVE STRUCK THE ALLOWANCE OF A HIGHWAY BILLBOARDS- FURTHER THAN FIFTEEN MILES FROM THE BORDER. BUT OBVIOUSLY WE STILL SEE A LOT OF CANNABIS BILLBOARDS OUT THERE- WHO ENFORCES THIS AND- WHAT TYPE OF ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN AGAINST THE VIOLATORS AND WHEN CAN WE SEE MORE ACTION. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND I WILL TURN IT OVER TO ASK MY DEPUTY DIRECTOR CLOSING AT TEN ACROSS AND FROM OUR LEGAL DIVISION BUT BEFORE I DO. I WILL SAY- THE DEPARTMENT HAS A COMPLAINTS AB PORTAL WHERE INDIVIDUALS MAY GO IN AND SUBMIT COMPLAINTS OF VIOLATIONS SUCH AS- THE ONE THAT YOU IDENTIFIED ASSEMBLY WOMAN- AND THAT IS SOMETHING THE DEPARTMENT HAS WORKED OUT WITH OPERATORS TO RESOLVE. ALL OF THOSE COMPLAINTS THAT WE RECEIVED RELATED TO BILLBOARDS TO DATE- DEPUTY DIRECTOR CALLS AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO ADD ANY MORE TO THAT. NO I THINK THAT'S ACCURATE AND IT AT THIS POINT BECOMES PRIMARILY A COMPLAINT DRIVEN ENFORCEMENT DRIVING. AND WE DID RUN THERE THE REGULATION THAT WAS ACTUALLY DONE PRIOR TO THE PENDING PACKAGE- AFTER THE COURT ISSUED ITS RULING RELATED SPECULATION. SELL SELL EVERY BILLBOARD THAT HAS BEEN- IDENTIFIED HAS BEEN REMOVED IS THAT WHAT WE'RE HEARING. AS ILLEGAL. I BELIEVE EVERY AT EVERY BILLBOARD THAT HAS BEEN I IDENTIFIED VIA A COMPLAINTS TO THE DEPARTMENT I'M HAS BEEN REMOVED RESOLUTION WITH THE OPERATOR THAT SUBMITTED OR THAT THAT POSTED THAT ADVERTISING. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU AND THEN- HOW HOW CAN WE ENSURE THAT- CANNABIS IS NOT MARKETED ATTRACTIVELY TO- MINORS AND THEY DOUBLE UP I THINK. WE THERE WERE SOME SPECIFIC EXAMPLES LIKE NOT BEING ABLE TO USE MOVIE CHARACTERS AND I THINK THAT THOSE HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THE REGULATION SO- WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ENSURE THAT. WE ARE NOT MAKING CANNABIS A TRACTIVE TO. YOUNG PEOPLE. WE'RE DOING A NUMBER OF THINGS- AND I'LL LET AND I W. DIRECTOR CALLS AND SPEAK TO THE REGULATORY MODIFICATIONS IN THE INTENT BEHIND THIS- REGULATIONS ARE THAT YOU REFERRED TO. ASSEMBLY WOMAN AND- CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR SELAMA IF YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING PLEASE FEEL FREE TO. I CAN SPEAK TO THE REGULATIONS AND WE STILL HAVE PROVISIONS IN THE REGULATIONS PROHIBITING MARKETING THAT IS ATTRACTIVE TO CHILDREN. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS DONE IN THE CONSOLIDATED REGULATIONS IS THAT WE MOVED. THE ORDER OF WHERE SOME OF THE THINGS WERE IN THE REGULATIONS AND SEVEN NOW. ADVERTISING MARKETING INCLUDING LABELS- AND THE RESTRICTIONS ON MAKING THEM ATTRACTIVE TO CHILDREN HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED INTO ONE PLACE TO MAKE IT MORE CONVENIENT AND MORE CLEAR AND HE WELL AND- FINANCE. IN ONE FIVE ZERO FOUR ZERO OF OUR REGULATIONS AND CAN YOU ARE THERE EXAMPLES IN THERE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY JUST SAYING IT'S NOT ATTRACTIVE TO CHILDREN MIGHT. NOT BE SUFFICIENT IF YOU DON'T SHOW. SPECIFIC EXAMPLES. WE CERTAINLY DO IT TALK ABOUT IT THEY CAN'T USE ANY CERTAIN LIKENESSES AND ALL THE ALSO AND PROVIDE GUIDANCE IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS FROM PEOPLE OR GETTY COMPLAINTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE FOLLOWING THOSE RULES. A. AS IN CONVERSATIONS THAT I'VE HAD WITH A VARIETY OF- STAKEHOLDERS AGAIN ON THE ENFORCEMENT ISSUE- WE'VE HEARD THAT THERE ARE STILL A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF ILLEGALLY OPERATING CANNABIS RETAILERS AND- SO. WOULD LIKE TO KNOW AGAIN WHAT ARE THE PLANS FOR GREATER ENFORCEMENT AND COORDINATION WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. THANK YOU TO SPEAK TO THAT ISSUE ASSEMBLY WOMAN- ON THE ISSUE OF ENFORCEMENT RELATED TO RETAIL AND THIS IS A MULTI PRONGED- ISSUE THAT REQUIRES A NUMBER OF EFFORTS TO IT TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES THE LEGAL RETAIL POSE ADD TO CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. ARE FIRST AND FOREMOST I THINK I DID SPEAK TO OUR EFFORTS RELATED TO ENFORCEMENT- AND OUR ENFORCEMENT DIVISION DOES FOCUS AS WELL ON RETAIL- ILLEGAL RETAIL SPECIFICALLY. SECOND I WOULD SAY A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE STATE DOES NOT ALLOW FOR LICENSED RETAIL IN THEIR FIRST ACTIONS IN ABSENT THAT THOSE CONSUMERS STILL DEMAND PRODUCT- SO WE ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY TO SUPPORT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AS THEY BRING ONLINE SAFE. ACCESS FOR THEIR CONSUMERS THROUGH LICENSED RETAIL OPERATIONS IN THEIR JURISDICTION- BUT ENFORCEMENT DOES REMAIN A CENTRAL FOCUS OF THE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AND OUR ENFORCEMENT DIVISION I AS WELL AS OUR COMPLIANCE DIVISION A LEGAL DIVISION CONSTANTLY I WORK THROUGH ADDITIONAL WAYS THAT WE CAN GET ACT THAT ISSUE- SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON BUT WE ARE ALSO FOCUSING ON OTHER EFFORTS. SUCH AS LICENSING I THANK YOU I APPRECIATE IT AND I WAS A FEW MINUTES LATE SO I MIGHT HAVE MISSED THE BEGINNING OF YOUR OF YOUR COMMENTS DO YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC METRICS ON HOW MANY ILLEGAL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN. BEEN CLOSED. YES WE DO- SO FOR PURPOSES OF LOOKING AT OUR METRICS ADDED THE TOTAL WARRANTS THAT THE DEPARTMENT FOCUSED ON. OUR HAS HAVE PURSUED EITHER AS LEAD OR I IN SUPPORT FOR THE LAST YEAR OR SO JULY THROUGH APRIL OF THIS YEAR- ARE A HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE AND IT'S I REFERENCED IN MY OPENING STATEMENT THAT'S AN ALMOST TWO HUNDRED PERCENT. INCREASE OVER THE YEAR PRIOR- AND THAT. HAS RESULTED IN- CANNABIS VALUED AT OVER SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BEING SEIZED OFF THE ILLEGAL MARK. THANKS TO DO HAVE A NUMBER OF HOW MANY STOREFRONTS ARE OR A AS A ESTIMATE OF HOW MANY STOREFRONTS ARE OPERATING ILLEGALLY. SO FOR PURPOSES OF THE WARRANTS THAT HAVE FOCUSED ON RETAIL THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN FOLLOW UP AND PROVIDE YOU WITH THAT DATA I DON'T HAVE IT AT MY FINGERTIPS BUT I DO KNOW WE TRACK IT. AS IT RELATES TO THE NUMBER OF RETAILERS OPERATING ILLEGALLY THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE DISCUSSED WITH THE ASSEMBLY PREVIOUSLY THIS IS ANISSUE OF A FLUID NATURE OF THE END OF THE ILLEGAL MARKET THOSE NUMBERS CHANGE OVER TIME AS YOU SEE ENFORCEMENT AGAINST RETAILERS OCCUR. I'M AS THEY CHOOSE TO NOT TO RETURN OR IF THEY DO CHOOSE TO RETURN NOW WHERE THEY WHERE THEY CHOOSE TO RETURN I SAW THAT SAID THE NATURE OF THAT QUESTION OR THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS RATHER FLUID. THANK YOU AND THEN JUST ONE LAST QUESTION YOU DID MENTION TAX REFORM OF I AM ON THE- DURING THE REVENUE TAX COMMITTEE IT'S OBVIOUSLY WAS GOING TO BE HEARD IN THAT COMMITTEE AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE IN THE- BUDGET. A HOW WILL WE BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE OF MEMBERS. COMMENTS ON. OR GET THEIR INPUT INTO THOSE REFORMS IF THE IF THIS ITEM IS GOING TO BE IN THE BUDGET. WELL I CERTAINLY WOULD HOPE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS PLENTY OF AVENUES TO WEIGH IN ON ANY BILL THAT'S BEFORE THEM. HI IF THIS IS A THING THAT IS PURSUED IN THE BUDGET THAT THAT WOULD BE THE BILL AS YOU POINTED THAT WOULD GO THROUGH THE- BUDGET COMMITTEE I WOULD DEFER TO YOUR LEADERSHIP ON HOW YOU WAY AND- OUTSIDE OF YOUR EXISTING COMMITTEE STRUCTURE. ON BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION STRONGLY SUPPORTS IS THE ABILITY OF ALL MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE TO WAY AND BECAUSE ULTIMATELY I THINK. THE IDEA IS TO HAVE A BILL THAT HAS RESOUNDING SUPPORT ACROSS THE LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU AND IF WE ARE GOING TO- DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT ONE FOLLOW UP QUESTION. ONE FOLLOW UP QUESTION YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS YOU HAVE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE STAFF. AND YOU ALSO MENTIONED THAT YOU'RE ACTIVELY- RECRUITING FOR OPEN POSITIONS HOW MANY OPEN POSITIONS DO YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW IN YOUR DEPARTMENT.

FOR GETTING RID OF THE FOR THE CIVIC PRODUCTS THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE DANGEROUS FOR THE PUBLIC RATHER THAN WORKING TOWARD A LIST OF ALLOWABLE INHALABLE PRODUCTS. BASED ON AN FDA LEFT FOR WHICH THERE IS NO PROCESS TO- UP TO DATE WITH CANNABIS INGREDIENTS BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES NOT RECOGNIZE CANNABIS. AS AN ALLOWABLE SUBSTANCE WE HUMBLY ENCOURAGE THE DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROL TO ADOPT REGULATIONS TO PRIORITIZE POLICIES- THAT A DRAFT ELIMINATING PRODUCT INGREDIENTS THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE UNSAFE. THESE INCLUDE VITAMIN E. ACETATE POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL. AND MEDIUM CHAIN TRIGLYCERIDE TRIGLYCERIDES OR MCT OIL WE BELIEVE THAT FOCUSING ON GETTING THESE OUT OF PRODUCT AND DOING IT IN A WAY THAT THE PUBLIC IS VERY AWARE OF. WILL INCREASE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE DCC REGULATORY PROCESS. AND PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN PAYING SLIGHTLY MORE FOR LICENSE LEGAL REGULATED CANNABIS PRODUCTS. WHICH ARE CLEARLY KNOWN TO BE STATES BECAUSE THE STATE HAS A PROCESS OF ENFORCEMENT IN PLACE. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU CAN GO TO LINE PLEASE GO AHEAD.

SEVENTEEN FEEL FREE TO SUBMIT ANY COMMENTS THROUGH THE COMMITTEE WEBSITE PORTAL IF YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE THEM DURING THE HEARING TODAY. YEAH WE DO HAVE THEIR LINE UP IS NOTHING COMING FROM THAT DEPRIVE TWICE HERE SO THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING WRONG. ARE NONE NONE FURTHER AT THIS TIME GREAT THANKS SO MUCH- SO IF THE FOLKS FROM THE DEPARTMENT ARE STILL AVAILABLE- I WAS ASSUME THEY ARE EVEN I'M LOOKING AT A BLANK SCREEN. WE'RE HERE AWESOME THANKS- SO I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT MANY OF THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS ARE TO IMPLEMENT CONSOLIDATION- BUT OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT OF NEW POLICY IN THERE TOO SO- ONE QUESTION I WAS TO THE DEPARTMENT CONSIDER WHETHER CERTAIN POLICY CHANGES WERE. BETTER LEFT TO THE LEGISLATURE TO THIS TO DECIDE AND THAT DOES A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE WHICH WAS BROUGHT UP EARLIER. I KNOW ONE OF THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS DOUBLES THE CASE LIMITED TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS- THIS POLICY CHANGES ALSO IN A BILL CURRENTLY CARRIED BY ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES. THAT ALSO INCLUDES A NUMBER OF WORKER PROTECTIONS THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY INCLUDED IN THE RAGS. IS THE DCC CONSIDERING INCLUDING SOMEONE PROTECTIONS THAT WERE NEGOTIATED THROUGH THE MORE TRANSPARENT LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. EVEN THAT QUESTION CHAIR THE MOST RECENT MODIFICATIONS PROPOSED IN OUR REGULAR RULEMAKING PACKAGE REPRESENTS MODIFICATIONS FOR CLARIFICATIONS THAT IN A NUMBER OF INSTANCES. STAKEHOLDERS HAVE BEEN REQUESTING WE CONSIDER OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL YEARS THESE INCLUDE THINGS LIKE WHAT YOU HEARD INGREDIENT RESTRICTIONS INSPIRED. BY CALIFORNIA'S EXPERIENCE WITH THE PEIPING CRISIS OR A VALLEY. WHICH TOOK PLACE IN TWENTY NINETEEN. HI TWO MODIFICATIONS THAT RESULTED FROM OUR COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCES DURING KOBE. THE LEGISLATURE IS YOU KNOW VERY WELL AS VESTED WITH MASTER'S ALREADY TO ENHANCE REFINE OR CHANGED THE SCOPE OF OUR POLICIES AND NOTHNG ABOUT THAT AT THIRTY IS LIMITED. BY OUR RULE MAKING PROCESS IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT IN MCCARTY BELL IS STILL MOVING THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. AND SO I WON'T SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO THAT BILL BUT I DO APPRECIATE. AND THE LEADERSHIP OF THAT AUTHOR IN WORKING ON THOSE VERY CHALLENGING ISSUES. THANK YOU. FOR THAT OUT OF YOUR BECAUSE OF ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR NO. THE WEIRD WAY TO CONDUCT A HEARING- GREAT THANK YOU. BURFICT THANK YOU FOR THAT AND- YEAH AND I ALSO APPRECIATE THE RECOGNITION YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE- SIR IS AN IMPORTANT POLICY ISSUES- YOU KNOW MAKE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE AND- THAT Y'ALL ARE COGNIZANT OF THAT AND KEEPING THAT IN MIND IS AS YOU CONTINUE THREE EURO MAKING PROCESS AND WILL CONTINUE THROUGH OUR LEGISLATIVE PROCESS- IN REGARDS TO- PROVISIONAL LICENSES AND I KNOW THERE'S BEEN ALREADY A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS YOU YOU STARTED OFF- YOU KNOW YOU'RE TALKING POINTS REALLY DIVING INTO THIS- BUT I GUESS. YOU KNOW DIFFERENT CONCERNS AND FACTORS WHAT CAN WE BE DOING BETTER TO HELP GET EVERYONE ON AN ANNUAL LICENSE- AND WE GET WE FOR DIFFERENT FIGURES. ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE STILL ON PROVISIONAL LICENSES I KNOW YOU'VE PROVIDED ALL THE DIFFERENT DEADLINES UPCOMING DEADLINES. I TO TRANSITION FOLKS BUT BUT WHAT CAN WE DO BETTER- SET TO HELP GET EVERYONE ON AN ANNUAL LICENSE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION I THINK IT'S A VERY BIG QUESTION AND TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST- YOU KNOW. AS I ALLUDED TO AYE WE'RE PROCESSING THOUSANDS OF APPLICATIONS- AND AT THE SAME TIME CONVERTING PROVISIONAL LICENSEES. I TO ANNUAL LICENSES. I'M AND ONE THING THAT HAS SIGNIFICANTLY HELPED- OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS REALLY. I IS THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR LOCAL JURISDICTION EXISTENCE GRANTS WHICH WILL REALLY AIMING TO HELP LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WITH. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PROVISIONAL LICENSES- MOVE THROUGH THAT LOCAL PROCESS AS WELL AS MEET THIS NET SORT OF. HI BAR OF SEQUEL. ASSOCIATED WITH THAT LICENSE I THINK THE BEST THING THAT WE CAN COLLECTIVELY DO A WHEN IT COMES TO ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGERS AT CHALLENGES OF ATTAINING ANNUAL LICENSURE. IS TO LOOK AT THE ANNUAL LICENSING PROCESS AND FIGURE OUT WHERE WE CAN REMOVE DUPLICATION IF APPROPRIATE BETWEEN LOCAL AND STATE LICENSING PROCESS SEES. AND START TO DO A REALLY DEEP DIVE ON HOW WE CAN FURTHER STREAMLINE THE ANNUAL LICENSING PROCESS AND THAT WILL REQUIRE. AYE ENGAGEMENT WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN AND KEEP US IN THE LOOP AS YOU IDENTIFY SOME OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES FOR STREAMLINING ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY- WHAT'S THAT SPEAKING OF DIE CUT. APPLICATIONS AND PROCESSES AND TIMELINES WHAT'S THE CURRENT PROCESS AND TIMELINE FOR NEW LICENSE APPLICATION. SO I THINK THAT THAT TIMELINE VARIES BROADLY- DEPENDING ON THE LOCAL JURISDICTION PROCESS OF THE LICENSE TYPE. AND THE THOROUGHNESS OF THE APPLICATION SO- I'M VERY THOROUGH APPLICATION OUT WITH A LOCAL JURISDICTION I THAT HAS THE ABILITY TO MOVE THEIR PERMITS AND SEQUEL PROCESS QUICKLY I WITH A MORE SIMPLE LICENSE TYPE IS ANYWHERE FROM SIXTY TO NINETY DAYS. GOTCHA BUT IT CAN GO UP TO WHAT'S WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE HIGH END. WELL WE STILL HAVE LICENSES WHO ARE IN PROVISIONAL LICENSURE I SO I THINK THAT SPEAKS TO THAT QUESTION THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF LICENSES SOCKS THAT WERE STOCKS IN I THINK I WOULD SAY TWENTY NINETEEN. ARE THAT ARE STILL ON PROVISIONAL LICENSURE AND HAVE NOT YET EIGHTEEN IN IN ALL SO I CAN BE THAT LONG AND LONGER GOTCHA THANK YOU. SOME JUDGE I KNOW THERE'S BEEN LOTS OF A CONVERSATION ABOUT FORSMAN AND LOTS OF CONCERNS RAISED BY COLLEAGUES ABOUT FORSMAN MOST OF WHICH HAPPENED WHILE I WAS NOT HERE- BUT LET ME TO SECOND YOU KNOW KIND OF THE CONCERNS- AND QUESTIONS AND ISSUES THAT COLLEAGUES RAISED- WHAT I GUESS MY QUESTION IS HOW MANY INFORMED YOU YOU MIGHT ALREADY ANSWER THIS BUT HOW MANY ENFORCEMENT CASES HAS THE DEPARTMENT TAKEN SINCE CONSOLIDATION. SO THE DEPARTMENT HAS TAKEN OFF FROM WITHIN THE ENFORCEMENT DIVISION EITHER LED OR SUPPORTED A HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE WARRANTS WHICH IS AN ALMOST 2100% INCREASE. UP FROM THIS YEAR. OVER LAST YEAR GOTCHA. IT'S. AND YOU TOUCHED UPON- AND I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT IT BUT YOU TOUCH ON TAX REFORM OBVIOUSLY TAX REFORM IS. THE EIGHT HUNDRED POUND GORILLA IN THE ROOM- YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT THAT THAT I HEAR ABOUT FROM. EVERY KIND OF STAKEHOLDER IN THIS IN THIS SPACE. WHAT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE A DEAL HAPPEN IS IT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S KIND OF POINT OF VIEW IS A TOTAL CONSENSUS WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS. OR IS IT JUST GETTING ENOUGH VOTES IN THE LEGISLATURE TO IT TO GET- TAX REFORM ACCOMPLISHED. WONDERFUL QUESTION I DON'T WANNA SPEAK UP WE HAVE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BUT I WILL SAY- JUST HAVING WORKED ON. YOU KNOW MAJOR POLICIES LIKE THIS IN THE PAST OBVIOUSLY HAVING UNANIMITY OF SUPPORT IS IDEAL. VERY CHALLENGING TO DO ON SUCH A COMPLEX BIG POLICY ISSUE. I SO OF COURSE I THINK IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL TO SEE EVERYBODY- SUPPORT A TAX REFORM PROPOSAL. AND IT CAME OUT OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE I DON'T KNOW IF THEY ALL WELL- BUT THAT'S THE NATURE THAT'S NATURE BIG POLICY. IT IS IT IS AND I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF A LOT OF DESIRE THAT A LOT OF DIFFERENT IDEAS. AMONGST MY COLLEAGUES- YOU KNOW WHO WERE THERE ALREADY TO GO F SOMETHING CAN'T GET ACCOMPLISHED- SO IS SO YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY THEY HOPEFULLY WERE ABLE TO GET SOMETHING ACCOMPLISHED THIS YEAR. TO PROVIDE THE RELIEF THAT I KNOW A LOT OF FOLKS ARE. LOOKING FOR- SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO SUPPORT. LEGAL OPERATORS AND CONTINUE TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR ILLEGAL OPERATORS TO. OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA- SO THAT IS ALL OF THOSE ARE ALL THE QUESTIONS I HAVE WANTED JUST QUICKLY LOOK TO CALL TO SEE IF ANY FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS. FROM ANYBODY LOOKING TO MY LEFT. LOOKING TO MY RIGHT. DON'T SEE ANYBODY. OUR WALL WE'RE GONNA EVERYONE CAN GET TO LUNCH AN HOUR EARLIER THAN THEY EXPECTED- THANK YOU MS ELLIOTT- AND INTO YOUR COLLEAGUES FOR- PARTICIPATING IN THIS MORNING'S OVERSIGHT HEARING THANK YOU.
